WEBVTT

00:20.103 --> 00:22.105
[screaming] [breathing heavily]

00:50.467 --> 00:51.760
It's a stupid game. Because I'm better at it?

00:56.598 --> 00:59.017
If I beat you again, you have to do
all my knuckle push-ups.

00:59.100 --> 01:02.062
Your skinny arms need the work, not mine.

01:02.145 --> 01:05.398
Lei Kung says, "A sharp mind can cut
as quick as the sharpest sword."

01:05.482 --> 01:09.611
Yu-Ti told us the Iron Fist must strike
their enemies as a falcon does,

01:09.694 --> 01:11.362
without mercy or hesitation.

01:11.446 --> 01:12.989
The Iron Fist protects K'un-Lun.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.742
He doesn't only guard the gates.
He kills all our enemies.

01:15.825 --> 01:19.245
Kills them? I don't think I could do that.

01:19.329 --> 01:21.372
Not even to the Hand?

01:21.456 --> 01:23.708
When I'm Iron Fist,
I'm gonna destroy them all.

01:23.792 --> 01:26.920
What if I joined the Hand?
Would you kill me?

01:27.003 --> 01:29.464
Of course not. We're brothers.

01:29.547 --> 01:32.675
If you were Iron Fist, Davos,
and Daniel were Hand,

01:32.759 --> 01:35.553
you would strike him down
without a second thought.

01:35.637 --> 01:37.597
That's why you will never face Shou-Lao.

01:37.680 --> 01:41.017
Compassion is your weakness,
a deficiency of character.

01:42.018 --> 01:44.687
The Iron Fist must remain
above all others.

01:44.771 --> 01:49.526
Chaste. Pure.
Without wife, family or friends.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.447
With practice comes mastery.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.909
With mastery comes knowledge.

01:59.536 --> 02:01.329
With knowledge comes strength.

02:01.412 --> 02:05.125
-What do you strive to become?
-The Immortal Iron Fist.

02:05.208 --> 02:06.209
[blow landing]

02:16.636 --> 02:18.513
If only you were alive to see.

02:27.355 --> 02:29.274
-[gunshots]
-[glass shattering]

02:29.357 --> 02:31.985
[man] Please, stop! Please.

02:35.613 --> 02:38.825
-[gun cocking]
-I'll get your money. I'll pay.

02:38.908 --> 02:42.579
You know how this works.
Break his wrists, so he isn't late again.

02:43.496 --> 02:45.498
[men grunting]

02:51.379 --> 02:52.505
[man groans]

03:01.723 --> 03:04.100
I didn't see anything. I promise.

03:05.059 --> 03:08.479
You don't need to fear.
I've come to protect you.

03:08.563 --> 03:09.981
Who were these men?

03:11.566 --> 03:13.401
Golden Tiger Triad.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.239
Where can I find more of them?

03:18.323 --> 03:20.950
There's a club on Ditmas and 17th.

03:29.584 --> 03:30.960
Who are you?

03:34.797 --> 03:36.674
The Immortal Iron Fist.

03:37.967 --> 03:39.594
[theme music playing]

04:55.586 --> 04:57.839
[sighs] Still no answer.

04:58.548 --> 05:01.592
Okay, before the call dropped,
what exactly did you hear?

05:01.676 --> 05:03.511
Uh, the sound of a fight,

05:03.594 --> 05:05.847
he said the name Mary,
and then the line went dead.

05:05.930 --> 05:08.933
But it just doesn't make sense.
She doesn't seem like the fighting type.

05:09.017 --> 05:10.476
Well, maybe she wasn't alone.

05:11.894 --> 05:15.606
Hey, look, whatever happened,
Danny probably kicked their ass.

05:15.690 --> 05:16.941
-Okay?
-Where is he?

05:18.359 --> 05:19.527
Trying to make me feel better,

05:19.610 --> 05:22.030
-but please do not feed me BS.
-I'm not feeding you any BS.

05:22.113 --> 05:25.366
Now, do you have an address for Mary
or a phone number?

05:25.450 --> 05:26.617
No, no.

05:27.702 --> 05:30.413
She called three nights ago.
Is that something we could trace?

05:30.496 --> 05:34.083
Maybe. Or we could get lucky with prints.
Where are those photos?

05:36.085 --> 05:38.463
[sighs] I knew something was off with her.

05:41.049 --> 05:42.884
I shouldn't have let Danny walk away.

05:42.967 --> 05:46.596
Oh, shoulda, woulda, coulda.
Look, Danny makes his own choices.

05:46.679 --> 05:50.808
If he's in trouble, we will pull him out.
Just like he would do for us.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.727
One more thing.

05:54.062 --> 05:56.356
She gave us this drawing.

05:57.565 --> 05:59.692
Are you sure there's nowhere else
you need to be?

05:59.776 --> 06:01.819
I got an offer for a promotion to captain.

06:01.903 --> 06:04.405
I'm taking a few vacation days
to figure it out.

06:04.489 --> 06:05.615
That's big.

06:06.282 --> 06:09.285
Whatever this is with you and Danny,
it's got my full attention, okay?

06:09.369 --> 06:12.038
Now, I'm gonna need something
that only the two of you touched

06:12.121 --> 06:13.539
to rule out your prints.

06:16.918 --> 06:21.130
-How long do you think this will take?
-If I call in favors, at least 24 hours.

06:21.547 --> 06:24.384
I have a better idea. I think I know
someone who can get this done faster.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.594
All right. Well then, lead the way.

06:26.677 --> 06:29.680
-I'm glad you're here.
-I'm glad you're glad.

06:35.019 --> 06:37.271
[grunts and breathes heavily]

06:49.617 --> 06:52.787
Time to wake up, sunshine.

06:54.997 --> 06:55.957
[gasps]

06:56.040 --> 06:57.542
[panting]

07:09.053 --> 07:10.596
[groaning]

07:26.279 --> 07:29.866
The amount of money you paid,
I thought you'd want to see it right away.

07:29.949 --> 07:33.077
[chuckles] Just leave it.
I'll watch later. Oh, no, that's not going to work for me.

07:36.372 --> 07:40.251
You watch. I erase.
And then we arrange payment.

07:41.544 --> 07:42.545
[chuckles softly]

07:44.380 --> 07:45.590
Okay.

07:53.473 --> 07:56.642
[Walker] <i>Time to wake up, sunshine.</i>

07:56.726 --> 07:57.935
[syringe plunges]

07:58.019 --> 07:59.479
[gasps]

07:59.562 --> 08:01.355
[panting]

08:01.439 --> 08:02.773
[video stops playing]

08:05.234 --> 08:06.235
[Walker] Hmm.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.362
Satisfied?

08:10.156 --> 08:12.825
It's... [chuckles softly]
It's what I asked for.

08:13.910 --> 08:17.497
I appreciate you trusting me
to get the job done.

08:18.247 --> 08:23.419
Not a lot of people would
stick their neck out like that for me.

08:24.879 --> 08:26.380
Yeah, of course.

08:27.548 --> 08:29.258
Someone walk over your grave?

08:32.011 --> 08:33.262
No, I, um...

08:34.639 --> 08:36.015
We were...

08:36.599 --> 08:38.851
We knew each other
when we were kids, and...

08:38.935 --> 08:41.479
it's just really funny
how so much can change.

08:42.271 --> 08:44.941
You don't have to explain yourself to me.

08:46.943 --> 08:50.738
Right, well, I'll, uh...
I'll text you when the money's ready.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.032
So, you know the deal.

08:53.115 --> 08:56.160
I was never here. We never met.
This never happened.

08:56.244 --> 08:57.537
Works for me. [chuckles]

08:57.620 --> 09:00.540
And you make sure your friend Davos
is on the same page.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.124
I will relay the message.

09:09.757 --> 09:13.010
I, uh... I'm not one to offer advice.

09:13.094 --> 09:16.430
But you did me a favor
when you kept me on this job.

09:17.223 --> 09:20.560
Davos is someone
to watch your back around.

09:21.227 --> 09:24.272
He's dangerous. Plain and simple.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.526
He and I...

09:30.236 --> 09:33.573
Our partnership is effectively over.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.993
But I appreciate the warning.

09:38.369 --> 09:40.454
I'll wait for your message.

09:49.255 --> 09:50.256
[door opens] [door closes]

09:58.055 --> 10:01.350
Is there any reason we couldn't have
done this in the comfort of my office?

10:01.434 --> 10:02.768
It needed to be sorted in private.

10:02.852 --> 10:05.354
Thought you were punishing me
for missing dinner the other night.

10:05.438 --> 10:06.314
[Colleen] Hmm.

10:06.814 --> 10:10.026
Excuse my manners. Ward Meachum.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.320
Misty Knight.

10:12.403 --> 10:14.864
Of course. Detective Knight.

10:15.406 --> 10:17.908
I've seen the specs on this arm of yours.

10:17.992 --> 10:19.910
And the purchase orders.

10:19.994 --> 10:22.288
Sort of like sporting
a Maserati with fingers.

10:22.371 --> 10:26.667
Well, I would be glad to trade you
for yours if you want it back.

10:26.751 --> 10:31.130
Uh, look, Ward, Danny is missing.
We think someone may have grabbed him.

10:31.213 --> 10:33.591
-Any idea who?
-That's what we need your help with.

10:33.674 --> 10:34.925
All we have is a name. Mary.

10:35.009 --> 10:38.346
And that may be an alias.
We're hoping she left prints on these.

10:39.221 --> 10:41.140
We're trying to avoid this going public.

10:41.223 --> 10:44.727
A media circus is never a good thing.
I'll put Rand corporate security on it.

10:44.810 --> 10:45.770
Thanks.

10:46.395 --> 10:47.480
Thank you, Ward.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.482
Of course.

10:51.901 --> 10:52.985
[Misty] Mmm!

10:54.070 --> 10:56.864
Okay. You don't like him, do you?

10:58.866 --> 11:01.285
He and Danny are like family. I'm trying.

11:01.369 --> 11:05.623
[laughs] If that look is you trying,
I would hate to see you not try.

11:05.706 --> 11:09.001
-[chuckles] I'll work on my game face.
-Eh, join the club.

11:09.877 --> 11:14.256
Hey. You know this investigation thing,
you got the right instincts.

11:14.340 --> 11:15.424
We'll see.

11:16.217 --> 11:18.094
While we're waiting on
tall, dark and arrogant,

11:18.177 --> 11:20.346
is there anybody else
who might have a lead on Mary?

11:21.305 --> 11:22.264
Come on. All right.

11:31.023 --> 11:32.233
Oh, shit.

11:32.316 --> 11:33.734
Yo, look what we found.

11:38.197 --> 11:41.701
This is the guy from the restaurant.
The one that pissed the Tigers off.

11:41.784 --> 11:42.785
Dude's messed up.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.578
Maybe we offer him up to them.

11:44.662 --> 11:46.789
We could make some bank off his sorry ass.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.541
[all laugh]

11:48.624 --> 11:49.792
[both grunting]

11:52.294 --> 11:56.757
-How much you think we'll get?
-Who cares? Long as we get paid.

11:59.135 --> 12:01.137
[electronic music playing]

12:19.071 --> 12:20.406
Hey, pal, private party.

12:20.489 --> 12:21.991
[yells and grunts]

12:23.325 --> 12:24.744
[woman screams]

12:25.703 --> 12:28.330
-[bouncer] Yo!
-[woman shrieks]

12:33.169 --> 12:34.754
[laughing]

12:51.103 --> 12:53.439
[bouncer 2] Hey, man,
where do you think you're going?

12:53.522 --> 12:54.523
[grunting]

12:56.901 --> 12:58.527
[people shouting indistinctly]

13:09.955 --> 13:12.750
If that was an audition...

13:16.754 --> 13:17.963
I'm impressed.

13:18.047 --> 13:21.175
I'm here to tell you
the Triad war is over.

13:21.759 --> 13:22.760
[Ho] No.

13:23.427 --> 13:26.597
-Is that so?
-I will end it.

13:27.348 --> 13:28.349
[chuckling]

13:34.146 --> 13:35.856
[grunting]

14:10.224 --> 14:11.225
[Ho grunts]

14:17.106 --> 14:21.402
Wait, wait, wait!
You want to end the Triad, I can help you!

14:22.945 --> 14:24.905
All the Triads. I know where they live,

14:25.489 --> 14:27.658
where they collect their protection,
smuggle their wares.

14:28.325 --> 14:32.204
Not just Triads. All criminals.

14:33.080 --> 14:36.333
If someone is doing something
they shouldn't in this city, I know.

14:37.001 --> 14:38.460
I can tell you where they are.

14:39.211 --> 14:40.629
Hell, I'll take you there.

14:40.713 --> 14:41.797
[cell phone vibrates]

14:48.053 --> 14:50.681
I want you to meet me in two hours
at the Greenpoint Pier.

14:51.307 --> 14:52.850
Bring a list.

14:53.976 --> 14:57.897
If you don't show your face
or you try something ill-advised,

14:57.980 --> 15:00.149
then your name
goes to the top of that list.

15:10.367 --> 15:11.744
[Priya] Time to wake.

15:13.287 --> 15:14.997
I've brought your medicine. Your father couldn't come.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.547
He has more important things to attend to.

15:25.299 --> 15:29.136
His other son, Daniel Rand,
will now face the dragon.

15:31.305 --> 15:32.848
[breathes shakily]

15:36.769 --> 15:38.354
[groaning]

15:41.857 --> 15:43.692
[Priya] I know what you're thinking.

15:45.653 --> 15:48.322
"I was blinded by the sun, Mother.

15:49.198 --> 15:52.785
-Danny used a trick to gain advantage...
-[Davos groans]

15:52.868 --> 15:56.538
...Lei Kung betrayed me
when he called the fight, Mother.

15:57.081 --> 15:58.874
I never yielded."

16:00.876 --> 16:03.128
Excuses for your failure.

16:15.724 --> 16:19.937
Better I were barren than to bring
a disgrace like you into this world.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.438
Second best.

16:22.064 --> 16:25.067
The fool who lost his birthright
to an outsider.

16:25.150 --> 16:26.485
[pottery shatters]

16:33.450 --> 16:35.577
I thought I had raised a champion.

16:37.121 --> 16:38.622
I was mistaken.

16:39.832 --> 16:42.084
I now must wear that shame.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.213
[door closes]

16:48.090 --> 16:51.135
Mother, I'm sorry. [breathing deeply]

16:58.642 --> 17:00.644
I will make you proud.

17:02.646 --> 17:04.106
I will make you proud.

17:06.775 --> 17:08.110
I will make you proud.

17:12.322 --> 17:14.158
I will make you proud.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.410
I will make you proud.

17:17.369 --> 17:18.787
I will make you proud.

17:31.425 --> 17:33.302
[Ryhno] Any word from the Tigers yet?

17:34.595 --> 17:37.639
Yo, screw waiting. Go find 'em.
It's time to get paid.

17:38.348 --> 17:42.227
Is that what this is about? Money?
[chuckles]

17:43.020 --> 17:44.480
I can get you money.

17:46.523 --> 17:47.941
Sure. You're rich.

17:49.234 --> 17:51.320
Which is why you sling furniture for cash.

17:51.403 --> 17:55.449
Look, whatever you're planning,
it's not worth it.

17:57.951 --> 18:01.246
Just cut me loose.
I'll keep this to myself.

18:03.082 --> 18:06.085
Why the hell you still standing here?
Get on it.

18:07.878 --> 18:09.880
[breathing heavily]

18:26.897 --> 18:28.649
[screaming in pain]

18:32.069 --> 18:34.071
[panting]

18:39.201 --> 18:40.285
Misty. Anything?

18:42.830 --> 18:45.541
No. Danny told me he ran into Mary
at this coffee shop,

18:45.624 --> 18:48.877
but none of the baristas
even remembers a redhead coming in.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.505
-No chance there are any cameras?
-Mmm-mmm.

18:51.588 --> 18:53.507
Well, I got nothing on my end, either.

18:54.883 --> 18:58.887
Listen. Until we hear back from Meachum,
we should just keep hitting the streets.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.014
With these things,
you never know what might turn up.

19:01.098 --> 19:03.559
He's hurt. I can tell. I can just tell.

19:03.642 --> 19:07.312
Didn't you say he was one of the best
martial artists you've ever seen?

19:07.396 --> 19:09.314
Coming from you, I could believe it.

19:09.398 --> 19:12.860
He's okay. We just got to keep looking.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.488
What is it?

19:24.037 --> 19:25.747
At the docks, I told him to go.

19:25.831 --> 19:29.042
The way I remember it,
he was already heading in that direction.

19:29.126 --> 19:30.127
It's not...

19:32.713 --> 19:34.298
I was done with this.

19:34.965 --> 19:37.050
I was done with this life, you know?

19:37.593 --> 19:39.845
I hung up my katana for a reason. And I...

19:40.262 --> 19:41.847
I knew this was gonna happen.

19:42.472 --> 19:44.433
I saw that he was getting
reckless with the fist,

19:44.516 --> 19:46.643
but I just didn't want to deal with it.
And now--

19:46.727 --> 19:49.396
He is an adult, Colleen.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.442
Look, I get it. I saw your place.

19:53.525 --> 19:55.736
You two are building a life together.

19:56.403 --> 19:58.447
But being in a relationship with someone

19:58.530 --> 20:00.866
is not the same
as taking responsibility for them.

20:02.242 --> 20:03.243
-I know.
-Do you?

20:03.327 --> 20:05.120
I know. I do. I just...

20:05.704 --> 20:08.123
I keep telling myself it's his path,
his choice,

20:08.207 --> 20:09.708
and that I should let things be.

20:09.791 --> 20:10.792
[chuckling]

20:12.878 --> 20:14.755
I can't let anything just be.

20:14.838 --> 20:17.716
I run background checks
before I go on a date.

20:17.799 --> 20:18.842
Come on.

20:18.926 --> 20:19.968
I'm serious.

20:20.510 --> 20:22.554
It's murder on the sex life,

20:22.638 --> 20:25.599
but it's not so bad on the arrest quota.

20:25.682 --> 20:27.100
[laughs]

20:29.394 --> 20:34.399
Look, the way I see it,
your side of the street is clean.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.360
I appreciate that.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.612
Hey, I kind of owe you.

20:38.695 --> 20:41.198
You did save my life at Midland Circle.

20:41.281 --> 20:43.992
And then you got me over the hump
with this thing.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.328
It's priceless.

20:47.287 --> 20:50.874
-Pricey may be a better word.
-[laughs]

20:50.958 --> 20:53.001
Right. What did Meachum call it?

20:53.085 --> 20:55.254
-My Maserati arm.
-Maserati arm.

20:55.337 --> 20:56.338
[both laugh]

20:56.421 --> 20:58.423
[dispatcher] <i>Units, be advised.</i>
<i>Multiple fatalities.</i>

20:58.507 --> 21:02.177
<i>1754 Ditmas Street, six-one-six.</i>
<i>Suspect still at large.</i>

21:02.261 --> 21:05.305
-[Colleen] What's a six-one-six?
-[Misty] Possible suspect with abilities.

21:05.389 --> 21:07.724
[engine revving]

21:12.521 --> 21:14.898
-Come on.
-[groans]

21:21.405 --> 21:23.282
Yo, I don't think he's gonna make it.

21:24.157 --> 21:27.953
We need him breathing.
The Tigers won't give a shit if he's dead.

21:28.036 --> 21:30.122
Open up. Come on.

21:33.333 --> 21:35.335
[breathing heavily]

21:44.970 --> 21:47.097
You were at the restaurant
the other night.

21:48.181 --> 21:53.061
-Silver Lotus. You know my girlfriend.
-Whatever, man. Sure. Just drink. Come on.

21:56.106 --> 21:57.107
Please.

21:58.984 --> 22:01.778
Tell her I'm here. Find her.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.074
Why in the hell would I do that?

22:06.158 --> 22:07.784
Whatever this is...

22:09.244 --> 22:14.166
I don't blame you. I get it.
You're just kids stuck in a hard place.

22:14.249 --> 22:19.379
-Call me a kid again, see what happens.
-Please. Whatever you need.

22:19.463 --> 22:24.384
-A roof over your head, food... I got you.
-Dude, just give it up. Come on.

22:34.311 --> 22:36.396
Just know, if I die here...

22:38.148 --> 22:40.067
that you're gonna have to live with that.

22:53.455 --> 22:54.873
I got your message. You wanted to see me.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.253
Make yourself at home, why don't you?

23:01.588 --> 23:04.091
Yeah, Walker came by. She, uh...

23:05.008 --> 23:08.428
-She showed me the video.
-I hope it's all you expected.

23:11.598 --> 23:13.016
Yeah, well...

23:14.059 --> 23:16.853
now that our jaunt together is over,
I thought we should get together, make sure we are on the same page
as far as covering our tracks.

23:20.440 --> 23:22.401
We probably shouldn't be seen together.

23:23.652 --> 23:26.696
And I would like my key back.

23:31.618 --> 23:34.788
We're finished with
what we agreed to in Paris.

23:35.831 --> 23:39.209
We've brought Danny low
and made him feel the depth of loss.

23:40.585 --> 23:45.298
But while you may be done with this, Joy,
I've only just begun.

23:48.260 --> 23:51.596
Okay. That's not what we discussed.

23:52.681 --> 23:57.269
Did you think taking the Iron Fist
from Danny was an end unto itself?

23:58.562 --> 24:02.274
-That's how you presented it to me.
-I didn't just take it, Joy.

24:04.151 --> 24:07.362
I have become the thing
Danny never had the strength to be.

24:08.405 --> 24:11.074
I've-- I've grasped my destiny.

24:12.325 --> 24:14.703
Your fist lights up.
That's really exciting.

24:14.786 --> 24:17.706
This is not a weapon to be held.
It is to be used.

24:18.915 --> 24:19.916
Okay.

24:20.542 --> 24:23.962
So what? Are you gonna... You planning
on running around the streets

24:24.045 --> 24:27.424
-and stopping crime like Danny did?
-I'm going to do what he couldn't do.

24:30.385 --> 24:34.264
Davos, I'm fairly used to you
speaking in riddles, but...

24:36.850 --> 24:39.269
Look, you have your Iron Fist...

24:39.352 --> 24:42.355
I'm very happy for you.
Every good boy deserves one.

24:43.815 --> 24:48.069
But this cannot blow back on me.
I am building something.

24:49.112 --> 24:51.573
You can't compartmentalize
who you are, Joy.

24:51.656 --> 24:54.034
You don't just get to pretend
this never happened.

24:54.117 --> 24:56.036
That's exactly what I get to do.

24:56.745 --> 25:00.832
This is my life we're talking about.
Everything that I've worked for.

25:00.916 --> 25:05.128
This is my life.
Everything I've worked for.

25:07.047 --> 25:09.174
I'm the Iron Fist, Joy.

25:10.133 --> 25:13.053
A sacred duty,
passed down for generations.

25:13.136 --> 25:14.679
And you could be part of it.

25:17.682 --> 25:18.767
All right.

25:19.809 --> 25:25.106
Look, let me just take some time and...
think through this.

25:32.614 --> 25:34.783
I know what you are capable of, Joy.

25:35.367 --> 25:38.245
For good and for ill.

25:41.414 --> 25:45.752
Just know that every choice you make
from here on in may have consequences.

25:46.753 --> 25:47.921
Do you understand?

26:00.433 --> 26:01.685
[door slams shut]

26:04.187 --> 26:05.397
[exhales]

26:14.948 --> 26:16.950
[line ringing]

26:44.811 --> 26:45.812
Mother?

26:49.774 --> 26:51.151
I know you're in there.

26:55.864 --> 26:57.866
I'm leaving K'un-Lun...

26:59.242 --> 27:01.119
and I'm going to bring Danny back.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.041
I just, um...

27:09.836 --> 27:13.131
I know-- I know how much
you sacrificed for me.

27:15.508 --> 27:19.846
And I know that you pushed me so that
I might have the keenest edge in battle.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.771
There are things unsaid between us.

27:30.148 --> 27:33.443
There are things other mothers
could say to their sons, things other sons could just...

27:39.658 --> 27:41.201
say to their mothers.

27:45.747 --> 27:47.582
I may not return, Mother.

27:54.047 --> 27:57.342
My bones may rot in cursed soil,
far from home.

28:01.262 --> 28:03.390
Is there anything you want to say to me?

28:12.649 --> 28:15.276
This may be your last chance
to speak your heart.

28:19.781 --> 28:20.782
Please.

28:26.663 --> 28:29.582
[inhales and exhales deeply] Okay.

28:29.666 --> 28:30.792
[sniffles]

28:31.626 --> 28:33.712
I understand what I must do.

28:35.755 --> 28:38.925
I haven't told Father or the Yu-Ti,
but I just...

28:40.093 --> 28:42.387
I just-- I just wanted you to hear...

28:48.101 --> 28:49.978
I will make you proud, Mother.

28:52.230 --> 28:55.024
And I won't rest
until my destiny is realized.

29:04.242 --> 29:07.328
And then maybe you'll be able to say
the words you cannot say.

29:10.373 --> 29:11.583
[sniffles]

29:37.192 --> 29:39.194
[indistinct chatter]

29:42.113 --> 29:46.284
-Who's the tagalong?
-Uh... she's my CI.

29:48.661 --> 29:50.872
Do we have a cause of death on these?

29:50.955 --> 29:52.499
These two are pretty straightforward.

29:52.582 --> 29:55.585
Two Asian males, knife wounds,
severed carotids.

29:56.377 --> 29:58.546
This guy, though, he's a mess.

29:58.630 --> 30:02.342
Blunt force trauma to the chest
like nothing I've ever seen.

30:02.425 --> 30:05.637
Whatever hit him, threw him
across the room into the wall so hard,

30:05.720 --> 30:08.765
it shattered his spine
and caved the back of his head in.

30:09.390 --> 30:12.560
-Oh, God. What the hell does that?
-Beats me.

30:12.644 --> 30:15.021
[Misty] Please tell me
that we have witnesses.

30:15.563 --> 30:18.358
A couple of escorts hiding out back there
had a lot to say.

30:18.441 --> 30:21.110
We got 'em with an artist now,
but I wouldn't bet on an ID.

30:21.194 --> 30:22.111
Great.

30:22.195 --> 30:24.781
One of them said
the perp had a glowing red hand.

30:25.448 --> 30:27.450
[scoffs] Only in New York, right?

30:27.951 --> 30:30.245
-You sure they said red?
-[woman] Yeah, red.

30:30.954 --> 30:33.331
Thanks a lot, Sammy. Appreciate it.

30:34.666 --> 30:35.708
It wasn't Danny.

30:35.792 --> 30:38.253
No. But then who was it?

30:38.336 --> 30:39.462
[cell phone vibrates]

30:42.298 --> 30:43.299
[Colleen] Hello?

30:45.635 --> 30:47.303
How did you get this number?

30:50.306 --> 30:53.476
-Okay, we'll be right there.
-Meachum get a hit on the prints?

30:53.560 --> 30:55.728
It wasn't Ward. I know where Danny is.

30:58.064 --> 30:59.274
You heard about the Tigers?

31:00.692 --> 31:03.194
-How much are they offering?
-They ain't gonna bite, Ryhno. -If you screwed up the deal, I'm--
-[Crank] There is no deal.

31:05.864 --> 31:09.033
Mr. Ho got murked,
and no one's sure who's gonna replace him.

31:09.117 --> 31:12.370
-Ho got popped? By who?
-I went by the club like you said.

31:12.453 --> 31:14.622
One of the bartenders said
a dude with a glowing fist

31:14.706 --> 31:16.833
came up in there
and smoked Ho and his men.

31:16.916 --> 31:18.459
You said a glowing fist?

31:19.252 --> 31:20.712
-Hey.
-Shut it!

31:20.795 --> 31:23.089
-What are we gonna do with him?
-We could just let him go.

31:23.172 --> 31:26.217
Shut up. Get him over here.

31:35.727 --> 31:38.688
-He said he had money.
-Now you believe me, huh?

31:38.771 --> 31:43.276
-$500, we'll let you go.
-I don't have any cash on me.

31:43.359 --> 31:46.070
You think we're stupid? We're not stupid.

31:50.491 --> 31:51.326
[Danny groans]

31:52.785 --> 31:54.579
[Ryhno] Grab his hand.
Put it over here.

31:58.374 --> 32:00.126
-Wait. Wait, don't.
-[gun cocks]

32:00.877 --> 32:03.212
NYPD. Drop it.

32:03.838 --> 32:06.257
Look, don't make this
harder than it has to be.

32:06.341 --> 32:08.927
[scoffs] Or what? You gonna shoot us?

32:09.594 --> 32:10.595
Yes.

32:11.346 --> 32:12.597
I'd do what she says.

32:12.680 --> 32:15.934
Yo, this is some next-level shit.
Can we just be done with this?

32:16.017 --> 32:18.811
You want your boy here in one piece,
then pay up.

32:18.895 --> 32:20.313
You could get us killed.

32:20.396 --> 32:21.648
-She's bluffing.
-[BB] She's not.

32:23.816 --> 32:27.820
What about NYPD didn't you understand?

32:27.904 --> 32:29.113
Drop it.

32:31.324 --> 32:32.325
[exhales in relief] Now!

32:42.210 --> 32:45.088
Now, we are walking out of here with him.

32:45.171 --> 32:47.590
Does anybody have a problem with that?

32:48.424 --> 32:51.386
Whatever.
Saves us from dealing with this shit.

32:51.469 --> 32:52.679
You know what?

32:53.513 --> 32:55.390
You almost crossed a line here.

32:56.307 --> 32:59.644
One that your little narrow ass
can't walk back from. Now, go.

33:05.650 --> 33:07.443
Man, am I glad to see you two.

33:07.527 --> 33:09.612
[Misty] You're not
looking so good, friend.

33:09.696 --> 33:12.657
You kidding me?
[chuckles] I totally had this.

33:13.741 --> 33:17.412
-[Colleen] What did they do to you?
-[Danny] It wasn't them. It was Davos.

33:18.037 --> 33:19.664
[Colleen] And Mary is a part of this?

33:20.206 --> 33:21.457
[Danny] She took me to Davos.

33:21.541 --> 33:24.168
-[Danny panting]
-[Colleen grunts]

33:25.753 --> 33:28.881
He, uh... He did a ceremony on me, and...

33:30.341 --> 33:32.010
now my fist is gone.

33:32.093 --> 33:33.636
[Colleen] How is that even possible?

33:34.220 --> 33:35.638
That would explain the club.

33:35.722 --> 33:36.639
The club?

33:36.723 --> 33:39.225
Later. We need to get you to a hospital.

33:39.308 --> 33:42.687
No. No. No hospitals.
I need to find out what happened.

33:44.063 --> 33:47.692
You have lost a lot of blood, okay?
You need help.

33:47.775 --> 33:49.610
-Claire?
-Uh-uh.

33:49.694 --> 33:50.987
Look...

33:51.070 --> 33:55.074
Call Ward.
Rand's got to have a doctor on standby.

33:56.659 --> 33:57.869
It's your call.

33:59.579 --> 34:02.123
-[Colleen] Okay, come on.
-Come on.

34:03.207 --> 34:04.542
[Danny groans]

34:06.836 --> 34:10.298
-[Misty] Okay. Easy. Easy.
-[Bethany] What the hell happened to him?

34:10.381 --> 34:12.008
[Colleen] It's complicated.
Can you help?

34:12.091 --> 34:14.218
Question is,
do I want to be a part of any of this?

34:14.302 --> 34:19.015
-You work for Rand, or...
-Bethany's a friend who's also a doctor.

34:19.098 --> 34:21.684
This is Colleen. That's Misty.
This is Danny.

34:22.268 --> 34:23.311
[Danny wheezes]

34:24.604 --> 34:27.065
-Can you can hear me, Danny?
-[groaning]

34:27.148 --> 34:28.691
Do you know how this happened to you?

34:28.775 --> 34:29.859
[grunts]

34:29.942 --> 34:32.570
I'm an anesthesiologist.
Your friend needs a hospital.

34:32.653 --> 34:34.655
He's Danny Rand, as in Rand Enterprises.

34:34.739 --> 34:37.617
We have to keep him out of the spotlight
for a lot of reasons.

34:37.700 --> 34:39.077
Bethany, please...

34:39.744 --> 34:40.953
[Bethany sighs]

34:41.037 --> 34:43.831
We need to stop the bleeding.
Do you have a first aid kit?

34:49.712 --> 34:50.922
Who are you people?

34:53.758 --> 34:55.593
Uh, what can I do to help?

34:55.676 --> 34:57.428
-Tell me your name again.
-Colleen.

34:57.512 --> 35:00.223
[Bethany] Colleen, your friend Danny
isn't doing so well.

35:00.306 --> 35:02.558
So I need you to step back
and let me do what I can.

35:04.435 --> 35:05.770
[wheezing]

35:06.437 --> 35:08.189
[winces]

35:08.272 --> 35:09.690
[groaning]

35:16.197 --> 35:18.407
[groaning in pain]

35:18.491 --> 35:20.368
Aren't you supposed to say,
"This is gonna hurt"?

35:20.451 --> 35:22.870
Ward, you too.
In fact, all of you back off.

35:26.457 --> 35:27.625
This is gonna hurt.

35:27.708 --> 35:29.544
[breathing heavily] Uh-huh.

35:29.627 --> 35:32.797
Hey, that woman you and Colleen
had me look into, Mary Walker,

35:32.880 --> 35:35.299
she's beyond bad news. Did she do that?

35:38.302 --> 35:39.846
Just one second, Meachum.

35:39.929 --> 35:42.557
What's... What's going on?
What's happening?

35:44.934 --> 35:46.435
He's stabilized.

35:49.272 --> 35:52.066
Someone needs to stay by his side
for the next 24 hours.

35:53.651 --> 35:55.027
Keep the wounds clean.

35:55.820 --> 35:58.948
Any sign of infection or fever,
and you call 911, yes?

35:59.490 --> 36:01.576
-Yes. And thank you.
-No worries.

36:02.451 --> 36:06.289
Next time your friend gets messed up,
do not call me.

36:06.372 --> 36:07.373
Got it?

36:08.416 --> 36:09.792
Loud and clear.

36:11.836 --> 36:13.045
[sighs]

36:15.798 --> 36:18.593
Hey. I'm sorry.

36:18.676 --> 36:20.678
I should never have come here.

36:20.761 --> 36:23.681
I shouldn't have called you.
I was scared for my friend.

36:24.432 --> 36:27.685
Look... I understand to a point.

36:28.811 --> 36:32.523
You say he's family. Fine.
That can be complicated.

36:33.566 --> 36:35.735
Just be upfront with me from now on.

36:36.611 --> 36:38.404
I don't like being part of this.

36:39.572 --> 36:44.619
But... it is good to know that
you are capable of caring about someone.

36:49.457 --> 36:51.042
[Misty] Hey, so, um...

36:52.043 --> 36:54.128
you said you had a line on Mary?

36:54.212 --> 36:59.050
Not really. Uh, her fingerprints
were in a... a military database.

36:59.133 --> 37:02.345
-Um, Special Ops, redacted.
-Seriously?

37:03.054 --> 37:06.182
Yeah, she left on a medical discharge
and she went freelance.

37:06.265 --> 37:08.893
Which is also why her name
was in a Rand database.

37:08.976 --> 37:12.021
So there is a chance
that she was hired by Davos.

37:12.104 --> 37:14.273
To follow Danny and bring him in.

37:14.357 --> 37:15.942
Wait, Davos?

37:16.651 --> 37:19.195
-Joy's whatever he is?
-[Colleen] Yeah.

37:19.278 --> 37:21.280
I thought they were like brothers.

37:22.490 --> 37:25.284
He did that? Why?

37:25.826 --> 37:28.746
The Iron Fist.
Davos wanted it, and now he has it.

37:28.829 --> 37:30.915
And he's out there
killing members of the Triad.

37:31.624 --> 37:34.460
-Davos killed someone?
-[Misty] Yeah, it looks that way.

37:35.461 --> 37:38.547
Oh, God. Joy.

37:39.924 --> 37:41.884
Wait, who is Joy?

37:41.968 --> 37:43.970
Uh, his sister. She's dating Davos.

37:44.053 --> 37:46.931
If he can do this to Danny,
then who knows what he's capable of.

37:47.014 --> 37:48.140
I need to tell her.

37:48.224 --> 37:50.268
How do you know she's not there by choice?

37:50.351 --> 37:52.311
Listen, I know my sister.

37:52.395 --> 37:55.439
But you just said that Mary's name
was in the Rand database.

37:55.523 --> 37:57.692
Your sister had to have access.

37:57.775 --> 38:00.194
-Colleen, this is Joy we're talking about.
-Call her.

38:00.278 --> 38:02.863
You know the situation between us.
She's not gonna answer my call.

38:02.947 --> 38:06.242
Okay. Well, you stay here with Danny,
and we'll go and pick her up.

38:06.325 --> 38:09.036
-I'll go with you.
-[Colleen] No, no, you were right.

38:09.120 --> 38:12.498
The way she was talking about you, she's
more likely to come with us than with you.

38:12.581 --> 38:15.167
And you heard Bethany.
Danny can't be alone.

38:17.628 --> 38:19.380
-Rest up.
-[Danny groans]

38:19.463 --> 38:21.007
We're gonna go get Joy.

38:23.217 --> 38:24.218
Thank you.

38:26.429 --> 38:27.471
For everything.

38:33.185 --> 38:35.354
What if Davos is with her?

38:35.438 --> 38:37.273
Well, then, we'll shut him down.

38:45.990 --> 38:49.827
-It's all there. Count it if you want.
-No, you wouldn't short me.

38:52.872 --> 38:55.082
Hey, what you said about Davos earlier...

38:56.500 --> 38:59.628
I think you're right.
I think he's dangerous.

39:01.756 --> 39:03.674
I need to do something about it.

39:05.634 --> 39:09.180
Well, take a long vacation
somewhere far away.

39:10.598 --> 39:13.017
You clearly have the means.

39:13.100 --> 39:17.104
I'm on the verge of doing something
that is very important to me.

39:17.188 --> 39:19.023
I'm not running because of him.

39:19.106 --> 39:21.525
Then you're in a bit of a conundrum,
aren't you?

39:24.111 --> 39:29.158
I need protection.
At least until I figure out an exit plan.

39:29.950 --> 39:33.120
I can take your money, run protection,

39:33.788 --> 39:35.081
but it's a Band-Aid.

39:35.164 --> 39:38.709
If this guy Davos decides he wants
to hurt you, all bets are off.

39:38.793 --> 39:43.214
And if you don't want to run,
you need to eliminate the threat.

39:45.925 --> 39:48.260
Eliminate is a word with connotations.

39:48.344 --> 39:49.637
No, it isn't.

39:50.221 --> 39:52.014
It's just what it sounds like.

39:58.938 --> 40:02.108
You can look over your shoulder
day and night forever,

40:03.692 --> 40:08.823
or you can hire me...
to make the problem go away.

40:11.242 --> 40:12.576
[sighs]

40:20.251 --> 40:21.252
[Ward] Hey.

40:23.629 --> 40:24.880
[Danny groans]

40:30.302 --> 40:32.847
-Ward... [groans]
-Easy.

40:32.930 --> 40:36.600
Danny, you need to rest.
You're all beat to shit.

40:39.770 --> 40:43.149
Aren't you supposed to be, like, the best
fighter in the world or something?

40:44.191 --> 40:46.444
[both laugh]

40:46.944 --> 40:49.363
[Danny] Oh, man...

40:49.447 --> 40:53.742
Davos got the drop on me.
I wasn't thinking on his level.

40:56.078 --> 41:01.292
And what level is that?
Machiavelli meets Dracula?

41:01.375 --> 41:02.835
[chuckles softly]

41:04.837 --> 41:06.213
He was calculated.

41:07.256 --> 41:09.216
-Strategic.
-[Ward clears throat]

41:10.759 --> 41:12.094
One step ahead.

41:14.013 --> 41:15.181
Anyway.

41:18.184 --> 41:19.310
[sighs]

41:21.145 --> 41:23.063
And now he's got what he wanted.

41:24.231 --> 41:29.320
Are you sure it's gone? The... Fist?

41:32.281 --> 41:34.408
It feels like the connection went dark.

41:36.660 --> 41:39.830
It must feel like losing part of yourself.

41:44.001 --> 41:45.544
It wasn't a part of me.

41:47.505 --> 41:48.839
It was me.

41:51.091 --> 41:52.801
[thunder rumbling]

41:53.344 --> 41:54.845
I let it get in my head.

41:56.388 --> 41:59.058
Wasn't thinking straight. Lost control.

41:59.141 --> 42:00.434
Lost my balance.

42:01.560 --> 42:04.522
I wasn't gathering or centering chi.
I was just...

42:06.899 --> 42:08.692
[sighs] I was just burning it up.

42:10.277 --> 42:12.488
I wish I had the first idea
of what you meant

42:12.571 --> 42:15.199
when you start talking
about things like chi.

42:18.077 --> 42:19.745
I was going out every night.

42:20.538 --> 42:21.956
Trying to keep the peace.

42:24.542 --> 42:26.835
I was getting better
at using the Fist. I...

42:28.254 --> 42:31.006
I didn't even need to think about it.
It was just there.

42:32.341 --> 42:35.261
And with it, a sense of clarity.

42:36.262 --> 42:37.888
Momentum. Grace.

42:38.806 --> 42:41.767
A feeling that would just move through me.

42:43.018 --> 42:45.354
When I really got into a flow, I...

42:46.897 --> 42:48.399
I could feel something.

42:51.277 --> 42:52.611
It was the dragon.

42:55.489 --> 42:56.824
Shou-Lao.

42:57.992 --> 43:01.036
I could feel his eyes watching me.

43:03.497 --> 43:07.793
His fire... burning inside of me.

43:11.880 --> 43:13.090
And I welcomed him.

43:14.967 --> 43:19.555
All of his... All of his anger,
his power...

43:21.140 --> 43:22.516
and his rage.

43:25.728 --> 43:28.063
And when the dragon was really with me...

43:30.107 --> 43:32.109
it felt good. [chuckles softly]

43:33.736 --> 43:36.071
It felt like I could break the world.

43:38.866 --> 43:41.076
[sighs and clears throat]

43:44.955 --> 43:47.583
I know. Dragons, right?

43:48.792 --> 43:49.835
Hard to believe.

43:50.502 --> 43:53.047
No, it's not that. I... [clears throat]

43:55.966 --> 43:59.470
[sighs] I've been
sitting in a lot of NA meetings lately.

43:59.553 --> 44:01.263
AA. All the "A"s.

44:02.264 --> 44:08.979
Hearing people talk about their pills,
their booze, their sex... their anger.

44:10.856 --> 44:14.652
But listening to you just now, I...

44:17.488 --> 44:19.239
I really related.

44:21.909 --> 44:23.118
Brother...

44:24.662 --> 44:26.538
I've seen that same dragon.

44:27.373 --> 44:29.375
[thunder rumbling]

44:33.504 --> 44:36.840
I don't know.
There's got to be another way around this.

44:38.384 --> 44:40.678
Well, think about it.
But don't wait too long,

44:40.761 --> 44:43.806
'cause I'm heading out of town
and I won't be back this way soon.

44:46.225 --> 44:48.310
-Are you expecting anyone?
-No.

44:48.394 --> 44:49.603
Quiet as a mouse.

44:49.687 --> 44:51.438
[Colleen] Joy, it's Colleen.

44:52.648 --> 44:54.608
We need to talk about Davos.

44:54.692 --> 44:58.070
Come on, I know you're in there.
We spoke to your doorman.

44:58.904 --> 45:00.823
It's not a good time, Colleen.

45:01.949 --> 45:03.283
[knocking on door]

45:03.367 --> 45:05.369
[Misty] NYPD. Open the door.

45:10.207 --> 45:11.583
Just a moment.

45:19.091 --> 45:21.719
-What's going on?
-You alone?

45:21.802 --> 45:23.429
Yeah. Why?

45:26.265 --> 45:27.891
[laughs]

45:27.975 --> 45:31.270
Your friend Davos. We think
you might be in danger, Ms. Meachum.

45:31.353 --> 45:32.730
I'm sorry, who are you?

45:32.813 --> 45:34.940
Detective Misty Knight.
We need you to come with us.

45:35.524 --> 45:36.900
I'm not going anywhere.

45:36.984 --> 45:40.779
Davos is not who you think he is.
He did something terrible to Danny.

45:40.863 --> 45:42.573
[Misty] With Mary Walker's help.

45:44.783 --> 45:47.619
Um, I don't know who that is.

45:47.703 --> 45:49.705
[Misty] You're not alone, are you?

45:50.289 --> 45:52.499
I am alone, Detective.

45:52.583 --> 45:54.668
Uh, okay. Excuse me.

45:54.752 --> 45:58.380
You can't just-- You can't just
come into my apartment. Excuse me.

45:59.173 --> 46:00.758
Step out where we can see you.

46:01.967 --> 46:03.427
[Joy] No one is here.

46:04.595 --> 46:05.929
Mmm-hmm.

46:11.351 --> 46:12.394
[both grunting]

46:22.404 --> 46:24.156
[both grunting]

46:25.324 --> 46:27.284
-Mary?
-No, baby.

46:33.415 --> 46:34.458
What the...

46:59.608 --> 47:00.692
Enough!

47:03.570 --> 47:05.697
There are a couple of ways this could go.

47:05.781 --> 47:07.825
There's no time for a flesh wound,

47:07.908 --> 47:10.410
so I will put the bullet
between your eyes.

47:11.787 --> 47:13.330
-[exhales]
-[Misty] Or...

47:21.463 --> 47:22.840
Drop it.

47:41.567 --> 47:44.278
[Walker breathing heavily]

47:52.870 --> 47:55.706
At these meetings, everybody has a story.

47:56.665 --> 48:03.630
Bethany's been trying to get me to talk,
to take a step, but... I can't.

48:05.591 --> 48:09.052
Say the truth in front of all
those strangers, how can I do that?

48:09.720 --> 48:14.016
I think that's the point, Ward.
You just gotta keep showing up.

48:14.099 --> 48:15.100
[scoffs]

48:16.143 --> 48:17.978
Why? [chuckles]

48:19.521 --> 48:21.648
It's all part of this stupid plan.

48:21.732 --> 48:27.279
I do all the steps. I get all healthy.
I sit down with Joy. She forgives me...

48:28.488 --> 48:31.074
for everything she thinks I've done.

48:31.158 --> 48:34.411
But I'm stuck on the fourth step.

48:34.494 --> 48:37.915
"Fearless and searching moral inventory."

48:39.082 --> 48:41.376
From the guy who murdered his father.

48:43.003 --> 48:44.254
Twice.

48:44.922 --> 48:49.009
Did I ever tell you the last words
my mother said to me?

48:49.718 --> 48:52.679
Oh, I'm sorry, man.
I'll just shut up, okay?

48:53.305 --> 48:55.182
No, it's okay.

48:58.602 --> 48:59.561
[Danny groans]

48:59.645 --> 49:00.646
Careful.

49:11.990 --> 49:13.784
She told me that she loved me.

49:14.368 --> 49:16.578
Right before she got
sucked out of the plane.

49:19.623 --> 49:21.625
I never got the chance to reply.

49:24.753 --> 49:27.381
Tell her I... felt the same.

49:31.259 --> 49:33.387
But I carried those words with me.

49:36.056 --> 49:41.770
And in K'un-Lun...
as much as they beat me, pushed me...

49:44.856 --> 49:46.733
I kept those words alive.

49:50.612 --> 49:54.574
And today, laying there,
fading in and out of consciousness, not...

49:58.745 --> 50:00.372
not knowing if I'd...

50:08.255 --> 50:11.508
I didn't know if I'd ever get the chance
to say those words

50:12.300 --> 50:15.095
to the people that I care about the most.

50:20.934 --> 50:23.020
People like you, Ward.

50:31.820 --> 50:35.032
I don't know if I've ever even said it.
[scoffs]

50:38.285 --> 50:39.828
Maybe to Joy.

50:44.374 --> 50:46.418
But I don't even remember when.

50:47.711 --> 50:52.674
You gotta make your peace...
with people you care about while you can.

50:56.136 --> 50:58.346
Otherwise, it will be too late.

51:06.605 --> 51:07.773
What?

51:08.231 --> 51:10.817
[stammers] Is this where I say the L-word?

51:14.154 --> 51:16.156
[both chuckling]

51:19.493 --> 51:20.452
[door opens]

51:21.995 --> 51:24.247
Mary? What's she doing here?

51:25.082 --> 51:26.500
She goes by Walker.

51:28.251 --> 51:29.252
[Ward] Joy.

51:30.378 --> 51:33.465
Hey. I'm so glad you're okay.

51:33.548 --> 51:34.716
-Hey.
-Just don't.

51:35.717 --> 51:39.179
Mary Walker wasn't the only person
working with Davos.

51:41.431 --> 51:42.432
Joy?

51:51.983 --> 51:53.485
I did this to you.

51:55.237 --> 51:56.363
With him.

51:59.199 --> 52:00.826
I paid her to be a part of it.

52:06.665 --> 52:10.210
I knew from the start
what he would take from you.

52:12.420 --> 52:14.339
I wanted to hurt you.

52:17.300 --> 52:18.468
And I did.

52:23.223 --> 52:25.016
And Davos isn't done yet.
