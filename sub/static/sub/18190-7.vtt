00:05.580 --> 00:07.650
I fear the Queen's wound is fatal.

00:07.700 --> 00:09.640
I won't let her die!

00:10.740 --> 00:12.970
~ What was that?
~ I believe it was a Stymphalian bird.

00:13.020 --> 00:14.490
Seize him!

00:16.180 --> 00:18.940
I am not who you believe me to be.

00:21.260 --> 00:23.600
The Queen is asking for you.

00:24.580 --> 00:26.650
It seems I am forever in your debt.

00:26.700 --> 00:28.690
You nearly died.

00:28.740 --> 00:30.260
Marry me.

00:38.620 --> 00:42.100
~ The city is awash with rumours.
~ Rumours of what?

00:43.140 --> 00:45.740
That the Queen is to marry Jason.

00:51.580 --> 00:52.810
You're certain?

00:52.860 --> 00:56.690
Our friend in court assures
me the rumours are true.

00:56.740 --> 00:57.730
Leave us.

00:57.780 --> 00:59.570
Surely this cannot
be allowed to happen.

00:59.620 --> 01:02.020
Do not make me ask you twice.

01:07.020 --> 01:08.370
Pasiphae?

01:08.420 --> 01:11.370
I have been weak. This
is what comes of it.

01:11.420 --> 01:13.650
He is your son.

01:13.700 --> 01:16.170
It is only natural you
have feelings for him.

01:16.220 --> 01:19.720
Because I held him in my
arms all those years ago?

01:19.780 --> 01:22.050
No.

01:22.100 --> 01:24.490
I will not let that destroy
everything we've worked for.

01:24.540 --> 01:25.730
What do you mean?

01:25.780 --> 01:29.340
If Jason takes the throne, Atlantis
will be lost to us forever.

01:32.020 --> 01:34.960
I would see him die
before that happens.

01:45.140 --> 01:46.450
Delmos?

01:46.500 --> 01:48.050
You wish to see me?

01:48.100 --> 01:49.450
What is it?

01:49.500 --> 01:52.050
When you appointed me General,
you asked for honest counsel.

01:52.100 --> 01:54.370
I meant what I said. Speak your mind.

01:54.420 --> 01:58.170
Your marriage to Jason.
He is not of royal blood.

01:58.220 --> 02:01.290
I fear the nobles will
never accept it.

02:01.340 --> 02:04.010
Perhaps in time their
attitudes will soften.

02:04.060 --> 02:07.730
No. They will sow discontent
and it will weaken you.

02:07.780 --> 02:09.570
You think I should give in to them?

02:09.620 --> 02:11.250
Does that not make me appear weak?

02:11.300 --> 02:14.250
A young Queen cannot afford
such powerful enemies.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.490
There seems little
point to being Queen

02:16.540 --> 02:19.210
if I must please my
enemies before myself.

02:19.260 --> 02:22.260
The throne gives the
illusion of power...

02:22.780 --> 02:24.930
.. but you need support.

02:24.980 --> 02:27.650
You cannot rule without it.

02:27.700 --> 02:31.170
I also asked you to swear
an oath of loyalty.

02:31.220 --> 02:33.690
Being loyal sometimes
demands hard truths.

02:33.740 --> 02:36.820
Your union with Jason is a mistake.

02:39.900 --> 02:41.770
Then we will consult the gods.

02:41.820 --> 02:46.450
It is for them to decide whether
the union is blessed...

02:46.500 --> 02:48.020
not you.

02:56.460 --> 02:59.330
The Queen seeks the gods' blessing
for her marriage to Jason.

02:59.380 --> 03:02.170
She fears the people
will not accept it?

03:02.220 --> 03:04.290
She is right to be concerned.

03:04.340 --> 03:06.340
There is much unease.

03:07.140 --> 03:10.300
Bring Jason and the Queen
to me at nightfall.

03:12.780 --> 03:15.320
They must make a blood offering.

03:17.460 --> 03:19.210
I can't believe how nervous I am.

03:19.260 --> 03:21.250
Have some wine. That
will ease your nerves.

03:21.300 --> 03:24.410
You can't make a blood offering to
the gods stinking of cheap wine.

03:24.460 --> 03:26.060
Fair enough.

03:31.980 --> 03:33.520
It is time.

03:36.380 --> 03:37.850
Good luck.

03:44.020 --> 03:45.610
It'll be fine.

03:45.660 --> 03:48.570
We know he's of royal blood,
even if he doesn't.

03:48.620 --> 03:50.970
That doesn't mean the
union will be blessed.

03:51.020 --> 03:53.090
Who can know the minds of the gods?

03:53.140 --> 03:56.410
They could shatter Jason's
hopes in an instant.

03:56.460 --> 03:59.330
Why would you say
something like that?

04:28.580 --> 04:30.410
You fear the gods' verdict.

04:30.460 --> 04:32.410
What if the omens aren't good?

04:32.460 --> 04:36.180
Do you believe that marrying the
Queen is the right thing to do?

04:37.460 --> 04:39.400
More than anything.

04:40.180 --> 04:43.120
There is no truer guide
than your heart.

04:49.900 --> 04:54.180
Exo t'haim' esetai kai
esso essetai haima.

05:02.860 --> 05:07.540
Exo t'haim' esetai kai
esso essetai haima.

05:10.980 --> 05:14.050
I will take your offering to
the sacred grove at Dodona.

05:14.100 --> 05:17.690
The gods will make their will known.

05:17.740 --> 05:20.940
At dawn, you will have your answer.

05:32.500 --> 05:36.930
When we next see each other, we
will know if our union is blessed.

05:36.980 --> 05:39.450
No matter what the gods
or anyone else says,

05:39.500 --> 05:42.170
I know we are meant to be together.

05:42.500 --> 05:44.970
Let us pray the omens are good.

05:52.500 --> 05:53.810
Even with the gods' blessing,

05:53.860 --> 05:57.760
there are still some who will
never accept the marriage.

06:00.380 --> 06:02.520
What did the Oracle say?

06:03.180 --> 06:05.250
We must return at dawn.

06:09.940 --> 06:11.650
Now will you drink some wine?

06:11.700 --> 06:13.540
Definitely.

06:16.380 --> 06:18.140
Drink up.

06:34.820 --> 06:37.540
Stay here, until I return.

06:57.900 --> 07:00.240
Ei keleai despoina pepoitha.

07:02.260 --> 07:04.890
Monon de tod' aito.

07:04.940 --> 07:06.850
Ara pater panton

07:06.900 --> 07:09.450
tod' antipalo

07:09.500 --> 07:11.140
popoeken?

07:15.980 --> 07:18.450
Ar-un suzugian

07:18.500 --> 07:21.850
eudaimon. E phamen uranius.

07:21.900 --> 07:25.580
Tus asteras engelaontas.

07:41.420 --> 07:43.300
We must return.

09:09.020 --> 09:11.970
It is as we hoped.
The omens are good.

09:12.020 --> 09:14.560
The gods have blessed the union.

09:15.580 --> 09:16.650
That is welcome news.

09:16.700 --> 09:18.890
Send word to the palace
that I have returned.

09:18.940 --> 09:21.280
I will see to it personally.

09:28.940 --> 09:32.540
You dare to violate
this sacred place?

10:23.460 --> 10:25.530
I feared you were dead.

10:45.740 --> 10:47.500
Jason? Jason?

10:51.260 --> 10:53.530
What happened?

10:53.580 --> 10:56.170
They've taken the Oracle.

10:56.220 --> 10:58.810
We continue to search the Lower
Town, but she may very well

10:58.860 --> 11:00.290
have been taken out of the city.

11:00.340 --> 11:01.930
Only Pasiphae would do such a thing.

11:01.980 --> 11:04.530
You don't think she
means to kill her?

11:04.580 --> 11:06.210
The Oracle is a servant of the gods.

11:06.260 --> 11:08.810
Anyone who tried to kill
her would be forever cursed.

11:08.860 --> 11:11.290
She means to stop the marriage.

11:11.340 --> 11:15.530
With the Oracle gone, you cannot
claim the union is blessed.

11:15.580 --> 11:18.610
I don't see how Pasiphae
could have taken the Oracle

11:18.660 --> 11:21.570
without the help of someone
inside the court.

11:21.620 --> 11:24.290
What about the soldiers that escorted
her to the sacred grove?

11:24.340 --> 11:27.210
Their loyalty is beyond question.
I hand-picked them myself.

11:27.260 --> 11:29.060
Widen the search.

11:30.180 --> 11:32.780
Do whatever it takes to find her.

11:35.460 --> 11:38.530
You believe I am the one who
betrayed the Oracle, don't you?

11:38.580 --> 11:41.450
There are rumours you
disapprove of the marriage.

11:41.500 --> 11:42.690
Is this true?

11:42.740 --> 11:45.370
How can I approve when it would
weaken the Queen's position?

11:45.420 --> 11:48.160
So you would do anything to stop it?

11:49.100 --> 11:52.290
There are those that conspire
against the Queen.

11:52.340 --> 11:54.280
I am not among them.

11:56.580 --> 11:58.930
Pasiphae was sheltering
in the Temple of Hecate

11:58.980 --> 12:01.650
in the Kalabrian Forest, so we
should assume that that's where

12:01.700 --> 12:03.330
they've taken the Oracle.

12:03.380 --> 12:06.580
We should keep this to ourselves until
we're certain who we can trust.

12:08.100 --> 12:11.970
Our friend in court has served
us well. Does anyone suspect him?

12:12.020 --> 12:13.650
Not that I am aware of.

12:13.700 --> 12:17.530
Good. I'm sure we'll have
further use for him.

12:17.580 --> 12:21.080
You should return to Atlantis
before you're missed.

12:42.180 --> 12:45.680
How strange it is to see
you languishing in a cell.

12:46.180 --> 12:49.050
You believe you can prevent the
union of Jason and Ariadne.

12:49.100 --> 12:50.330
You are wrong.

12:50.380 --> 12:54.410
The people believe that Jason
is not of royal blood.

12:54.460 --> 12:57.090
They will not accept the union
unless it is blessed by the gods.

12:57.140 --> 12:58.690
And without you, that cannot happen.

12:58.740 --> 13:00.810
You cannot stop Jason
taking the throne.

13:00.860 --> 13:02.410
Only the gods can do that.

13:02.460 --> 13:03.890
Your faith is your weakness.

13:03.940 --> 13:05.880
And Jason is yours.

13:07.700 --> 13:11.370
How does it feel, to know
that your own son hates you?

13:11.420 --> 13:13.370
I do not care what he thinks of me.

13:13.420 --> 13:16.490
He would despise you even
more if he knew the truth.

13:16.540 --> 13:17.930
I did what was necessary.

13:17.980 --> 13:20.130
You have betrayed everyone
close to you.

13:20.180 --> 13:22.610
You usurped one husband,
poisoned the other.

13:22.660 --> 13:25.330
And now you would have
your own son killed

13:25.380 --> 13:28.980
~ so that you can take the throne.
~ That's a lie!
~ Is it?

13:31.220 --> 13:34.010
That's why Jason's father
took him from you.

13:34.060 --> 13:37.160
And now that child has
returned to haunt you.

13:39.540 --> 13:41.340
He is your blood.

13:43.700 --> 13:46.370
You've held that baby in your arms.

13:47.940 --> 13:50.650
You cannot deny your love for him.

13:50.700 --> 13:52.770
I have no love for him.

13:55.540 --> 13:57.810
You lie, even to yourself.

13:59.900 --> 14:01.440
I pity you.

14:04.540 --> 14:07.220
Save your pity for yourself.

14:08.380 --> 14:09.700
Why?

14:11.300 --> 14:13.100
What do you mean?

14:22.780 --> 14:25.180
You will find out soon enough.

14:43.820 --> 14:45.810
I will enter the fortress alone.

14:45.860 --> 14:48.530
Is that safe?

14:48.580 --> 14:50.930
It would be perilous for anyone else.

14:50.980 --> 14:53.580
You and your men should wait here.

15:02.780 --> 15:05.690
We are still no closer to learning
who may have betrayed the Oracle?

15:05.740 --> 15:07.090
I'm afraid not.

15:07.140 --> 15:10.530
Who has access to the inner sanctum?

15:10.580 --> 15:12.570
Only trusted members
of the court have keys.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.450
I cannot believe it was one of them.

15:14.500 --> 15:18.250
Then how is it the intruders
were able to gain access?

15:18.300 --> 15:21.170
It seems we have a
traitor amongst us.

15:26.820 --> 15:29.090
It hasn't got any prettier.

15:43.380 --> 15:45.780
I thought you might be hungry.

15:46.660 --> 15:49.410
Do not pretend to care
for my wellbeing.

15:49.460 --> 15:51.600
You've come to taunt me.

15:52.420 --> 15:55.020
I will leave the food nonetheless.

15:59.460 --> 16:03.050
Holding me here will change nothing.
It only delays the inevitable.

16:03.100 --> 16:05.650
Such certainty.

16:05.700 --> 16:09.010
Was it your fate to
become my prisoner?

16:09.060 --> 16:10.770
The gods do not show me my own path.

16:10.820 --> 16:14.210
Your power resides in
fear and superstition.

16:14.260 --> 16:16.970
My power derives from the gods!

16:17.020 --> 16:20.220
And yet the gods appear
to have abandoned you.

16:28.260 --> 16:31.890
How long do you intend
to keep me here?

16:31.940 --> 16:33.660
Ah.

16:35.340 --> 16:37.140
You are confused.

16:38.820 --> 16:41.160
I do not intend to keep you.

16:42.940 --> 16:44.940
I intend to kill you.

16:52.820 --> 16:56.210
Then you will suffer
the wrath of the gods.

16:56.260 --> 16:59.760
I will suffer nothing. You
will not die by my hand.

17:00.420 --> 17:03.020
Who is it, then? Who will kill me?

17:04.780 --> 17:07.849
Bring them here and I will
tell them their fate.

17:07.900 --> 17:10.329
They will be cursed for ever.

17:10.380 --> 17:11.810
Nobody would dare.

17:11.859 --> 17:14.260
You think you're untouchable?

17:14.940 --> 17:16.569
You're wrong.

17:16.619 --> 17:19.220
What it is you mean to do with me?

17:23.420 --> 17:26.160
At last it is I who sees the future.

17:28.260 --> 17:32.340
How you enjoyed taunting
me with your... prophecies.

17:36.620 --> 17:39.920
It must be strange for
you, to feel so... blind.

17:48.020 --> 17:50.010
Oh.

17:50.060 --> 17:53.620
You should be glad the gods don't
allow you to see your own fate.

18:39.340 --> 18:40.980
No!

18:47.860 --> 18:51.060
There are some things
it is best never to see.

19:01.060 --> 19:05.650
Those Stymphalian birds won't taste
Hercules's blood, not today.

19:05.700 --> 19:08.290
~ Why didn't they take her at the grove?
~ What's that?

19:08.340 --> 19:10.730
The Oracle. Why wait until
she returned to Atlantis?

19:10.780 --> 19:14.250
~ It would have been easier
outside of the city.
~ What are you saying?

19:14.300 --> 19:17.900
I don't know. There's something
strange about the timing of it.

19:28.900 --> 19:30.810
Did everything go as planned?

19:30.860 --> 19:33.820
~ It was as you said it would be.
~ Good.

19:34.940 --> 19:37.210
Prepare the shrine, clear
your men from the temple.

19:37.260 --> 19:40.010
~ All of them?
~ Every living soul.

19:40.060 --> 19:43.340
You are to remain in the forest
until I tell you otherwise.

19:47.700 --> 19:49.540
You have the key?

20:06.420 --> 20:08.160
It's all right.

20:10.380 --> 20:12.320
You cannot harm us.

20:14.300 --> 20:16.100
Come.

20:31.740 --> 20:33.530
Oh, you poor child.

20:33.580 --> 20:35.330
I was promised you could cure me.

20:35.380 --> 20:37.450
And you were told there
would be a price?

20:37.500 --> 20:38.700
Yes.

20:40.940 --> 20:43.130
You will do as I ask?

20:43.180 --> 20:45.690
You are the first people
I have spoken to

20:45.740 --> 20:48.130
in as long as I can remember.

20:48.180 --> 20:53.570
Alone in that cave, I have felt
like I was losing my mind.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.760
All I know is silence...

20:57.260 --> 20:59.020
.. and darkness.

21:01.540 --> 21:05.100
I would rather die
than live like this.

21:10.780 --> 21:12.850
Take another's life...

21:15.060 --> 21:17.460
.. and I will end your misery.

21:22.060 --> 21:24.460
May the gods have mercy on me.

21:39.580 --> 21:41.610
The temple is only
a short distance away.

21:41.660 --> 21:43.410
Why are they camped in the forest?

21:43.460 --> 21:46.460
Whatever the reason,
I suggest we go around.

21:50.540 --> 21:52.650
One look,

21:52.700 --> 21:55.640
and I will put an end
to your suffering.

22:16.900 --> 22:19.440
There's someone here to see you.

22:31.660 --> 22:33.850
The gods will have their vengeance.

22:33.900 --> 22:36.440
And you will not live to see it.

22:39.020 --> 22:40.620
Turn around.

22:45.180 --> 22:47.520
It will be swift, I promise.

23:02.060 --> 23:03.970
Why are there no guards?

23:04.020 --> 23:06.730
It's a trap. We're
walking into a trap.

23:06.780 --> 23:09.380
There's only one way to find out.

24:42.140 --> 24:44.100
(No...)

24:55.020 --> 24:58.370
There's only one person
who could have done this.

24:58.420 --> 25:00.170
She wouldn't.

25:00.220 --> 25:01.970
How else do you explain it?

25:02.020 --> 25:04.560
She would never do such a thing.

25:06.980 --> 25:09.300
~ Medusa?
~ Hercules, wait!

25:12.180 --> 25:13.780
Jason?

25:15.340 --> 25:18.490
From the first moment
I arrived in Atlantis,

25:18.540 --> 25:20.880
she was always there for me.

25:25.060 --> 25:26.860
I am truly sorry.

25:28.500 --> 25:30.900
We have to go after Hercules.

25:33.220 --> 25:35.290
(They'll pay for this.)

25:42.460 --> 25:44.020
Medusa?!

25:47.980 --> 25:50.250
Medusa, it's me, Hercules.

25:52.900 --> 25:54.500
Medusa?

26:10.100 --> 26:11.700
You're cured.

26:13.740 --> 26:15.490
You're cured!

26:15.540 --> 26:19.040
I couldn't stand another
moment alone in that cave.

26:20.740 --> 26:23.080
Pasiphae promised me a cure.

26:26.580 --> 26:28.340
No...

26:30.700 --> 26:32.050
The Oracle?

26:32.100 --> 26:35.300
I didn't know it was going
to be her. I swear.

26:38.220 --> 26:41.570
I wanted just to be with you,

26:41.620 --> 26:45.860
to look on you with my own eyes.

26:49.740 --> 26:51.250
This is all my doing.

26:51.300 --> 26:52.650
There was nothing you could do.

26:52.700 --> 26:55.450
I should've tried harder.
I should've found a way.

26:55.500 --> 26:56.970
Hercules?!

26:59.180 --> 27:01.810
You must go. They will make you
answer for what you've done.

27:01.860 --> 27:04.690
~ It is no less than I deserve.
~ Don't say that.
~ Hercules!

27:04.740 --> 27:07.450
Remember the old hunting lodge,
in the mountains above the city?

27:07.500 --> 27:10.530
~ We slept under the stars.
~ Go there. I'll come for you when I can.

27:10.580 --> 27:12.770
No, I cannot bear to leave you again!

27:12.820 --> 27:15.490
~ You must, for both our sakes.
~ Hercules?!

27:15.540 --> 27:18.540
I will come for you
as soon as I can. Go!

27:26.140 --> 27:27.860
Hercules?

27:31.580 --> 27:33.130
Hercules?

27:33.180 --> 27:35.170
Where is she? Where's Medusa?

27:35.220 --> 27:36.490
I don't know.

27:36.540 --> 27:37.970
We need to find her.

27:38.020 --> 27:40.760
I've searched everywhere. She's gone.

27:43.340 --> 27:45.680
She must have fled long ago.

27:47.260 --> 27:49.660
We should return to Atlantis.

28:01.820 --> 28:03.760
Jason has returned.

28:20.380 --> 28:22.320
Where is the Oracle?

28:23.940 --> 28:26.290
We were too late.

28:26.340 --> 28:29.010
There was nothing that we could do.

28:30.580 --> 28:32.120
She's dead.

28:43.700 --> 28:45.370
I am so sorry.

28:46.180 --> 28:50.490
Surely even Pasiphae
would not dare kill her.

28:50.540 --> 28:52.940
She was a servant of the gods.

29:02.420 --> 29:05.860
She was turned to stone,
by the Gorgon Medusa.

29:12.780 --> 29:15.170
I want this Medusa hunted
down and brought before me.

29:15.220 --> 29:17.770
~ No!
~ Hercules...
~ I know Medusa. She's a good person.

29:17.820 --> 29:19.770
This is Pasiphae's doing.

29:19.820 --> 29:22.810
I do not doubt that
Pasiphae is behind it,

29:22.860 --> 29:26.410
but Medusa must answer
for what she's done.

29:26.460 --> 29:29.250
Please. I am begging
you to show some mercy.

29:29.300 --> 29:31.130
There can be no mercy!

29:31.180 --> 29:34.680
In the eyes of the gods,
there is no greater crime.

29:35.420 --> 29:38.290
Their vengeance will be...

29:38.340 --> 29:39.940
unimaginable.

29:53.020 --> 29:54.890
I thought you might be hungry.

29:54.940 --> 29:56.730
I have no appetite.

29:56.780 --> 29:58.520
You have to eat.

30:03.860 --> 30:06.210
There is nothing more
you could do for Medusa.

30:06.260 --> 30:09.450
She is as much a victim
in this as anybody.

30:09.500 --> 30:11.610
She killed the Oracle.

30:11.660 --> 30:14.200
She must have been under duress.

30:15.140 --> 30:17.540
Pasiphae must have forced her.

30:19.620 --> 30:21.290
I know Medusa.

30:22.900 --> 30:27.250
She has a good heart,
purer than any of us.

30:27.300 --> 30:30.240
It is many months since
we last saw her.

30:32.500 --> 30:35.570
Being cursed as she was,
it is a heavy burden.

30:35.620 --> 30:39.170
~ What are you saying?
~ She may not be the Medusa we know and loved.

30:39.220 --> 30:42.220
Don't say that. Don't
you dare judge her.

30:45.900 --> 30:48.300
~ I'm sorry.
~ You know nothing.

30:50.060 --> 30:52.800
~ You are not to blame.
~ Just leave me.

31:04.460 --> 31:06.860
I have never seen him so grim.

31:10.660 --> 31:13.130
Everything that has happened...

31:14.060 --> 31:17.260
.. it is all because I
agreed to marry Ariadne.

31:19.100 --> 31:22.090
A single decision can have many...

31:22.140 --> 31:24.280
unintended consequences.

31:26.020 --> 31:29.460
It is like ripples across a pond.

31:31.700 --> 31:34.290
That's not to say that
you're to blame.

31:34.340 --> 31:36.140
Marrying Ariadne.

31:37.500 --> 31:39.900
Nothing would make me happier.

31:41.620 --> 31:44.160
But maybe the price is too high.

31:48.300 --> 31:49.890
Where are you going?

31:49.940 --> 31:52.280
To try and stop the ripples.

31:55.340 --> 31:57.410
I can't believe she's gone.

31:57.460 --> 32:00.580
I know. It is too hard.

32:04.060 --> 32:05.600
What is it?

32:09.060 --> 32:11.410
With everything that's happened,

32:11.460 --> 32:14.370
are you sure we should be going
ahead with the marriage?

32:14.420 --> 32:15.650
You think we shouldn't?

32:15.700 --> 32:17.450
It isn't that I don't love you.

32:17.500 --> 32:22.460
I do, more than I can express, but
other people have suffered for it.

32:23.980 --> 32:27.450
The Oracle has paid with her life
so that I might marry for love.

32:27.500 --> 32:30.770
If we don't, she will have
given her life for nothing.

32:30.820 --> 32:32.130
This won't be the end of it.

32:32.180 --> 32:35.290
You know there are some that
will never accept our marriage.

32:35.340 --> 32:37.570
It seems that whatever we
do there will be suffering.

32:37.620 --> 32:39.770
Surely that is why we
must do what is right?

32:39.820 --> 32:43.120
You see, I'm no longer
sure I know what that is.

32:45.060 --> 32:47.970
The only thing I'm completely
sure of is that I love you,

32:48.020 --> 32:49.890
with all my heart.

32:51.540 --> 32:54.130
There's no doubt about
my feelings for you.

32:54.180 --> 32:56.970
But by marrying you, I put your
life at even greater risk.

32:57.020 --> 32:59.420
It is a risk I gladly accept.

33:02.340 --> 33:04.730
We have a responsibility
beyond ourselves.

33:04.780 --> 33:07.210
I know that more than anyone.
There isn't a day that goes by

33:07.260 --> 33:09.490
that I don't feel the weight
of that responsibility.

33:09.540 --> 33:10.970
I know how hard it is for you...

33:11.020 --> 33:13.170
Then share the burden with me.

33:13.220 --> 33:15.860
Stand by my side as my husband.

33:18.180 --> 33:21.450
Pasiphae fears our union. Surely
that makes it a good thing?

33:21.500 --> 33:23.450
No good has come of it so far.

33:23.500 --> 33:26.010
Then we will show the good
that can come from it.

33:26.060 --> 33:28.800
Let us not be cowed, or dictated to.

33:29.740 --> 33:33.140
You think our marriage
weakens me, you are wrong.

33:34.260 --> 33:36.860
I am stronger with you at my side.

33:37.380 --> 33:39.520
You really believe that?

33:40.620 --> 33:42.490
With all my heart.

33:50.900 --> 33:52.290
You wished to see me?

33:52.340 --> 33:55.080
I want to set a date for the wedding.

33:56.220 --> 33:58.130
Without the Oracle
to speak for the gods,

33:58.180 --> 34:00.570
the people will not accept
the union is blessed.

34:00.620 --> 34:03.290
I refuse to be cowed by Pasiphae.

34:03.340 --> 34:06.540
If I show weakness, she
will only grow bolder.

34:07.460 --> 34:10.050
Perhaps you should take
some time to consider it.

34:10.100 --> 34:13.820
My mind is set. Make the
necessary preparations.

34:15.380 --> 34:16.850
Of course.

34:27.020 --> 34:29.060
You're out of bed?

34:30.820 --> 34:35.139
You were right. Pointless, me moping
around feeling sorry for myself.

34:36.780 --> 34:39.380
What are you doing with the bread?

34:39.900 --> 34:41.610
This bread?

34:41.659 --> 34:43.250
Yes.

34:43.300 --> 34:45.770
I'm taking it to give to the poor.

34:45.820 --> 34:48.770
You're giving away our
food? What will we eat?

34:48.820 --> 34:52.219
I have no time for your selfish
ways. Shame on you.

34:59.900 --> 35:03.890
Ariadne plans to marry without
the blessing of the gods.

35:03.940 --> 35:05.730
That is sacrilege.

35:05.780 --> 35:08.650
You talk of sacrilege.
The Oracle was murdered.

35:08.700 --> 35:10.050
That was never part of the plan.

35:10.100 --> 35:14.000
You must have known that Pasiphae
would never let her go.

35:17.900 --> 35:22.050
It cannot happen. You
must stop the wedding.

35:22.100 --> 35:24.850
How? The Queen's mind is set.

35:24.900 --> 35:28.770
You are Poseidon's representative
on Earth. You speak for the gods.

35:28.820 --> 35:31.560
Surely they will not stand for this?

35:33.460 --> 35:37.540
If you fail, everything you hold
dear will be taken from you.

35:44.700 --> 35:46.640
Where have you been?

35:47.620 --> 35:49.170
I was in the tavern.

35:49.220 --> 35:52.330
I thought you were giving
our food to the poor?

35:52.380 --> 35:56.530
I was, then I went to the
tavern. It's thirsty work...

35:56.580 --> 35:59.690
Where were you, really? I
know something's going on.

35:59.740 --> 36:02.690
I don't have to explain
my whereabouts to you.

36:02.740 --> 36:04.680
What have you done?

36:12.580 --> 36:14.330
What is the meaning of this?!

36:14.380 --> 36:16.450
~ Search the house!
~ You have no right!

36:16.500 --> 36:17.970
Seize him!

36:18.940 --> 36:21.080
Take your hands off him!

36:22.460 --> 36:24.490
You've been accused of
murdering the Oracle.

36:24.540 --> 36:26.570
That's ridiculous!
Why would I do that?

36:26.620 --> 36:28.850
The High Priest demands that
you answer to the gods.

36:28.900 --> 36:31.170
He is innocent. Let him go!

36:32.820 --> 36:34.290
Of course!

36:36.540 --> 36:38.730
Of course. How could
I have been so stupid?

36:38.780 --> 36:41.330
That's why they didn't take the
Oracle at the sacred grove.

36:41.380 --> 36:43.610
~ Why?
~ Because they would only take her if the gods

36:43.660 --> 36:46.400
gave their blessing to the marriage.

36:46.500 --> 36:49.860
Who would be the first person
the Oracle told on her return?

36:51.980 --> 36:53.740
The High Priest.

36:54.900 --> 36:58.100
Why are you doing this?
You know I'm innocent.

36:58.860 --> 37:02.210
It is the gods who demand
you stand trial, not I.

37:02.260 --> 37:06.340
The Queen will try and put a stop
to this, but you must stand firm.

37:11.860 --> 37:14.180
Your Majesty? Your Majesty?

37:15.340 --> 37:16.650
What is it?

37:16.700 --> 37:19.170
It's Jason. He's been arrested.

37:19.220 --> 37:20.770
On whose authority?

37:20.820 --> 37:22.930
It was Melas.

37:22.980 --> 37:26.080
Jason stands accused
of murdering the Oracle.

37:29.780 --> 37:34.530
Before Poseidon, you are charged
with the most serious of crimes.

37:34.580 --> 37:36.810
I will see you pay for this.

37:36.860 --> 37:39.410
You dare threaten the High Priest?!

37:39.460 --> 37:43.410
What is the meaning of this?
Why has Jason been arrested?

37:43.460 --> 37:45.930
He stands accused of
murdering the Oracle.

37:45.980 --> 37:47.930
He must answer to the gods.

37:47.980 --> 37:50.980
And why would he have
reason to harm her?

37:51.980 --> 37:55.820
When the Oracle returned from
the sacred grove at Dodona...

37:56.940 --> 38:00.100
.. she told me that the gods
had not blessed your union.

38:05.380 --> 38:08.650
Jason murdered her so that
the wedding might go ahead.

38:08.700 --> 38:10.010
That's a lie!

38:10.060 --> 38:11.970
You were found alone in the temple,

38:12.020 --> 38:14.450
moments after the Oracle
was taken against her will.

38:14.500 --> 38:17.050
I was knocked unconscious
by the men who took her.

38:17.100 --> 38:19.290
You know I was.

38:19.340 --> 38:21.100
Lycidas?

38:24.380 --> 38:28.340
Is this the man you saw in the inner
sanctum after the Oracle was taken?

38:30.820 --> 38:32.560
Speak the truth.

38:33.660 --> 38:36.530
I heard a cry. I went
to the inner sanctum.

38:36.580 --> 38:38.380
What did you see?

38:39.300 --> 38:42.580
He was there, a knife in his hand.

38:45.340 --> 38:47.610
I have done nothing wrong.

38:48.780 --> 38:50.450
It was you.

38:50.500 --> 38:52.300
You betrayed her.

38:57.820 --> 39:00.290
You insult Poseidon
with your accusations.

39:00.340 --> 39:03.280
I will not stand for
this. Release him.

39:05.020 --> 39:07.210
The most heinous crime
has been committed.

39:07.260 --> 39:09.770
The gods have been blasphemed.

39:09.820 --> 39:11.330
You would deny them vengeance?

39:11.380 --> 39:12.890
I know Jason to be innocent.

39:12.940 --> 39:14.810
That is not for you to decide.

39:14.860 --> 39:17.370
It is for the gods and
those who speak for them.

39:17.420 --> 39:19.690
It is for the priests
to pass judgment.

39:19.740 --> 39:22.050
I do not seek to deny vengeance.

39:22.100 --> 39:26.090
But it must be brought on those
who committed the crime.

39:26.140 --> 39:29.290
You claim to speak for
the gods on this matter?

39:29.340 --> 39:33.210
I speak as Queen, as
servant to Poseidon.

39:33.260 --> 39:35.650
You say you are Poseidon's servant,

39:35.700 --> 39:38.700
yet you refute those
who would do his will.

39:40.140 --> 39:43.260
We all answer to the gods, even you.

39:44.380 --> 39:47.120
But perhaps you no longer think that?

39:47.900 --> 39:51.000
You believe yourself
to be above the gods?

40:07.660 --> 40:10.010
You are right...

40:10.060 --> 40:11.620
of course.

40:13.140 --> 40:16.850
All of us must answer to the gods.

40:16.900 --> 40:20.180
We must all face their judgment.

40:37.340 --> 40:39.890
Before Poseidon,

40:39.940 --> 40:41.940
you are found guilty.

40:43.220 --> 40:45.690
In accordance with our laws,

40:45.740 --> 40:48.010
you are sentenced to death.

41:15.100 --> 41:18.090
Jason has been found guilty
by Poseidon himself.

41:18.140 --> 41:19.810
Perhaps Your Highness

41:19.860 --> 41:22.410
could petition Poseidon
to show clemency.

41:22.460 --> 41:25.900
There can be no clemency,
only justice.

41:27.380 --> 41:29.900
The sentence must and
shall be carried out.
