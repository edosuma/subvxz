WEBVTT

00:03.133 --> 00:04.787
[laughter]

00:04.874 --> 00:06.310
Oh, I see.

00:06.397 --> 00:08.008
That's so sweet
of you guys to celebrate

00:08.095 --> 00:10.184
your anniversary with us.Oh.

00:10.271 --> 00:11.924
Well, we thought
it would be fun to share it

00:12.012 --> 00:13.578
with everyone who was there
at our wedding day.

00:13.665 --> 00:15.058
Plus, I forgot to make
reservations at a restaurant.

00:15.145 --> 00:17.365
And I forgot it was
our anniversary

00:17.452 --> 00:18.496
until about an hour ago.

00:18.583 --> 00:18.975
To the best wife ever!

00:19.062 --> 00:19.976
Hey!

00:20.063 --> 00:22.413
[whoops]

00:22.500 --> 00:24.154
I remember that wedding
like it was yesterday.

00:24.241 --> 00:26.548
Of course, I was
with Christina then.

00:26.635 --> 00:29.377
It was only later that she
ripped my heart out of my chest.

00:29.464 --> 00:32.902
But that night was fun.

00:32.989 --> 00:35.513
Carl, that is Christina's loss.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.515
May all the people
who dumped us burn in hell.

00:37.602 --> 00:39.691
Yeah.And here's to Mike and Molly.

00:39.778 --> 00:41.737
[all cheer]

00:41.824 --> 00:42.825
[yawning]:
Oh, boy.

00:42.912 --> 00:44.914
I am beat. How about you?

00:45.001 --> 00:46.263
Yeah, just came on like a wave.

00:46.350 --> 00:47.656
Maybe we should head back.

00:47.743 --> 00:48.657
You guys stay and
have a good time.

00:48.744 --> 00:50.006
Okay.Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:50.093 --> 00:51.312
This is your party.
What, are you just gonna

00:51.399 --> 00:53.009
run out on the bill?MIKE: You're right.

00:53.096 --> 00:54.880
You're right. Here we go.Yup, yup.

00:54.967 --> 00:56.491
Enjoy yourselves.Okay.

00:56.578 --> 00:57.535
What are we supposed
to do with that?

00:57.622 --> 00:59.711
Split a Lowenbrau?

00:59.798 --> 01:00.408
All right, here you go.
Make it last.

01:00.495 --> 01:02.192
Happy anniversary!

01:02.279 --> 01:03.541
Happy anniversary!

01:03.628 --> 01:05.848
They're gonna go do it, right?

01:05.935 --> 01:08.546
Oh, yeah.

01:08.633 --> 01:10.244
Can you imagine if we
needed an empty house

01:10.331 --> 01:11.636
every time we wanted
to have sex?

01:11.723 --> 01:14.726
Yeah, we'd be broke
and they'd be alcoholics.

01:14.813 --> 01:15.814
To the happy couple!

01:15.901 --> 01:18.556
ALL:
To the happy couple!

01:20.080 --> 01:22.430
[snores]

01:22.517 --> 01:23.996
[shouts gibberish]

01:24.084 --> 01:26.216

01:26.303 --> 01:28.262
[snoring]

01:30.742 --> 01:33.658
[shouts gibberish]

01:33.745 --> 01:35.617
You tell 'em, honey.

01:48.064 --> 01:52.112
BOTH:
Do not tell Mike.

02:19.617 --> 02:23.534
Damn it, why did you guys
have to leave so much cash?

02:23.621 --> 02:24.840
What were you thinking,

02:24.927 --> 02:29.018
giving free booze
to people like us?

02:29.105 --> 02:31.890
We were trying to be nice.

02:31.977 --> 02:34.632
Irresponsible is what you were.

02:34.719 --> 02:36.286
Your mother had
eight White Russians.

02:36.373 --> 02:37.374
You could've killed her.

02:40.290 --> 02:41.161
The booze I can handle.

02:41.248 --> 02:45.295
The dairy was the mistake.

02:45.382 --> 02:46.340
It wasn't
the only mistake last night.

02:46.427 --> 02:48.777
Morning.

02:48.864 --> 02:50.039
Oh, there she is.

02:50.126 --> 02:52.172
So, you and Carl
have fun last night?

02:53.999 --> 02:55.479
I'm surprised
you're walking straight.

03:00.484 --> 03:02.312
What?Excuse me?

03:02.399 --> 03:04.358
They were going at it like
they were never gonna stop.

03:04.445 --> 03:06.925
What, you watched?

03:07.012 --> 03:07.970
Oh, yeah!

03:09.711 --> 03:12.583
They were just jerkin'
and a-twerkin'.

03:12.670 --> 03:16.544
Yeah, grindin'
and never-mindin'.

03:18.067 --> 03:19.808
Yeah!

03:19.895 --> 03:22.114
After you left, they took
over that dance floor.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.595
Oh, good. Thank God.[sighs]

03:24.682 --> 03:27.424
You know, I think
I should go to work.

03:27.511 --> 03:30.427
Oy vay.

03:30.514 --> 03:32.603
Last time I had
that many White Russians,

03:32.690 --> 03:34.083
it was the '70s,

03:34.170 --> 03:36.912
and the Moscow Circus
was in town.

03:36.999 --> 03:39.001
Victoria, get down here.

03:39.088 --> 03:40.220
I know.

03:40.307 --> 03:41.656
Know what?

03:41.743 --> 03:43.658
I saw Carl in the
hallway last night.

03:43.745 --> 03:45.312
[groans]

03:45.399 --> 03:48.663
I told him he should've
climbed out the window.

03:48.750 --> 03:49.838
What were you thinking?

03:49.925 --> 03:51.666
I was thinking
nobody would see him

03:51.753 --> 03:54.712
if he climbed out the window.No!

03:54.799 --> 03:57.280
Carl is Mike's best friend
and his partner.

03:57.367 --> 03:59.064
How do you think
he's gonna take this?

03:59.151 --> 04:01.676
Again, the window would've
solved everything.

04:01.763 --> 04:02.329
No, it wouldn't 'cause
you still slept with him!

04:02.416 --> 04:03.547
Molly!

04:03.634 --> 04:05.723
If a tree has sex in the forest

04:05.810 --> 04:06.768
and nobody finds out,

04:06.855 --> 04:09.988
did it ever really happen?

04:10.075 --> 04:10.946
What?!

04:11.033 --> 04:11.816
I'm saying it's no big deal.

04:11.903 --> 04:13.514
Yes, it is a big deal

04:13.601 --> 04:15.037
because it's Carl.[huffs]

04:15.124 --> 04:16.995
Okay? And you-you
can't just throw him away

04:17.082 --> 04:20.564
like you do other men. He's not,
he's not a disposable razor.

04:20.651 --> 04:22.523
That's not fair.

04:22.610 --> 04:24.089
Is it true?

04:24.176 --> 04:27.571
Yes, but it's not fair.

04:27.658 --> 04:29.312
You know, you get
bored of this one,

04:29.399 --> 04:31.575
he's not going driving off
in the van that he lives in.

04:31.662 --> 04:33.969
He drives off
in a squad car

04:34.056 --> 04:37.015
with your brother-in-law,
my husband.

04:37.102 --> 04:38.539
What about your husband?Hi!

04:38.626 --> 04:39.540
He's cute.Yeah.

04:39.627 --> 04:42.891
And huggable and he minds

04:42.978 --> 04:44.849
his own business.

04:52.988 --> 04:55.251
I know what this is about.

04:57.775 --> 04:59.081
You do?

05:01.649 --> 05:03.346
She bought me that remote
controlled helicopter

05:03.433 --> 05:05.435
I wanted for my anniversary,
didn't she?

05:05.522 --> 05:06.567
Yes!

05:06.654 --> 05:10.092
Ah!

05:10.179 --> 05:11.746
Best wife ever!

05:13.748 --> 05:16.838
[laughs]

05:16.925 --> 05:19.797
Great. Now I've got to blow
200 bucks at Hobby Lobby

05:19.884 --> 05:22.583
'cause you can't
keep it in your pants!

05:32.375 --> 05:35.247
I know.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.118
What?

05:36.205 --> 05:38.033
I saw Molly this morning.

05:38.120 --> 05:41.558
She can't keep
secrets from me.

05:41.645 --> 05:43.691
She told you?

05:43.778 --> 05:45.257
I figured it out.

05:45.345 --> 05:49.000
And, Carl, I have been
wanting this for years.

05:49.087 --> 05:52.003
Seriously?

05:52.090 --> 05:53.657
Oh, yeah, it's gonna be
fun as hell.

05:53.744 --> 05:56.094
Man...

05:56.181 --> 05:58.619
this is such a relief.

05:58.706 --> 06:01.535
And don't worry,
we'll take turns.

06:03.667 --> 06:05.626
That is your sister-in-law.

06:05.713 --> 06:10.239
No, it's a remote control
helicopter.

06:10.326 --> 06:12.937
Oh.

06:14.504 --> 06:16.376
What were you talking about?

06:18.856 --> 06:20.728
Your helicopter thing?

06:23.774 --> 06:25.863
Man, I'm sorry.

06:25.950 --> 06:27.691
It's too late for that.
You can't undo what you did.

06:27.778 --> 06:29.737
It just happened.

06:29.824 --> 06:31.347
Nothing just happens.

06:31.434 --> 06:32.304
I don't care how drunk
you were last night.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.350
You broke an unspoken rule!

06:34.437 --> 06:35.569
It wasn't unspoken.
You've told me to keep

06:35.656 --> 06:38.441
my hands off of her
for three years.

06:38.528 --> 06:40.965
And you still slept with her!

06:41.052 --> 06:41.662
Slept with who?

06:41.749 --> 06:43.881
Just drop it.

06:43.968 --> 06:45.753
Was it the one-legged woman
in 4B?

06:47.624 --> 06:49.670
No.

06:49.757 --> 06:51.236
Was it the UPS girl
with the big boobs

06:51.323 --> 06:53.021
and the mustache?

06:53.108 --> 06:54.979
No.

06:55.066 --> 06:56.546
The balding lady
with the parrot?

06:57.765 --> 07:01.246
It was Victoria, okay?

07:01.333 --> 07:01.769
Is this true?

07:01.856 --> 07:05.250
Yup.

07:05.337 --> 07:06.861
You...

07:06.948 --> 07:09.211
dirty...

07:09.298 --> 07:10.647
dog!

07:10.734 --> 07:12.257
All right, all right.

07:12.344 --> 07:14.346
Take it easy.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.913
My man, this is big news!

07:16.000 --> 07:16.740
Hey! There's nothing
to celebrate here.

07:16.827 --> 07:19.090
Are you kidding?

07:19.177 --> 07:21.005
If he can get somebody
so clearly out of his league,

07:21.092 --> 07:23.312
that means there's
hope for us all.

07:23.399 --> 07:26.750
Hey, I'm a good-looking man.

07:26.837 --> 07:29.405
[chuckling]

07:29.492 --> 07:31.668
Carl, come on.

07:31.755 --> 07:33.061
Even you must know
that whatever looks you have

07:33.148 --> 07:35.542
go away as soon
as you open your mouth.

07:35.629 --> 07:38.588
And that-that's what makes
all this so confusing.

07:38.675 --> 07:39.546
She knows you.

07:39.633 --> 07:40.590
Well?

07:40.677 --> 07:43.332
Molly married you.

07:43.419 --> 07:44.812
Victoria slept with Carl.

07:44.899 --> 07:48.685
Clearly poor judgment
runs in the family.

07:48.772 --> 07:51.688
If only there was
a third sister.

07:51.775 --> 07:56.214
What the hell were you thinking?

07:56.301 --> 07:57.564
I was thinking, "I can't believe

07:57.651 --> 07:59.261
this hot chick
is sleeping with me."

07:59.348 --> 08:00.567
My man.

08:00.654 --> 08:03.047
Put it down!

08:03.134 --> 08:05.528
Down low?No!

08:05.615 --> 08:07.095
Carl, I know you.

08:07.182 --> 08:08.444
You fall too hard and too quick.

08:08.531 --> 08:10.446
And then you get bored
and you move on.

08:10.533 --> 08:13.144
And normally, I don't care,
but this is my sister-in-law.

08:13.231 --> 08:15.625
Damn it, how am I supposed
to tell Molly about this?

08:15.712 --> 08:17.061
Don't worry.

08:17.148 --> 08:18.585
She already knows.

08:18.672 --> 08:21.588
What?

08:21.675 --> 08:24.460
She caught me sneaking out
of Victoria's room last night.

08:24.547 --> 08:25.635
In my home?

08:29.944 --> 08:34.165
You did it in my home?

08:34.252 --> 08:36.472
Not all of it.
Some of it was in my car.

08:36.559 --> 08:37.734
Aah!

08:37.821 --> 08:41.999
I don't want to know!

08:42.086 --> 08:44.306
I kind of do.

08:52.662 --> 08:54.577
Hey, sweetie.

08:57.798 --> 09:01.410
Shish kebabs.

09:08.112 --> 09:08.809
Carl told you?

09:08.896 --> 09:11.681
Yes.

09:11.768 --> 09:14.031
And apparently
I'm the last to know.

09:14.118 --> 09:15.337
I'm sorry.

09:15.424 --> 09:16.512
Well, when were
you gonna tell me?

09:16.599 --> 09:18.601
Hopefully never.
I was hoping...

09:18.688 --> 09:21.822
hoping the whole thing
would just go away.

09:21.909 --> 09:24.172
Can I ask one question?

09:24.259 --> 09:25.260
What?

09:25.347 --> 09:25.956
Am I getting a remote controlled

09:26.043 --> 09:28.698
helicopter or not?

09:28.785 --> 09:32.397
It's in my trunk.

09:32.484 --> 09:34.269
Okay, it's not a cure-all.

09:34.356 --> 09:35.792
But it helps.

09:37.533 --> 09:39.404
Hey, Mike,
heard you come in.

09:39.491 --> 09:43.147
Of course you did, because
I wasn't sneaking around.

09:43.234 --> 09:45.062
Please don't be mad at me.

09:45.149 --> 09:47.456
What happened between me and
Carl last night was a mistake.

09:47.543 --> 09:48.892
A horrible mistake.

09:48.979 --> 09:51.503
[doorbell rings]Terrible.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.853
But horny is as horny does.

09:52.940 --> 09:55.725
And last night, horny did.

09:55.812 --> 09:59.468
Stop saying "horny."

09:59.555 --> 10:02.079
I promise it won't happen again.

10:02.166 --> 10:05.169
Carl and I both know
it was a one-time thing.

10:05.256 --> 10:06.997
Are you sure?Absolutely.

10:07.084 --> 10:10.348
We regretted it the
minute it happened.

10:10.435 --> 10:13.700
Well, actually the minute
after it happened.

10:13.787 --> 10:15.266
While it was going on,
we were pretty gung-ho.

10:15.353 --> 10:18.182
All right!

10:18.269 --> 10:20.402
Mike, don't worry.
I don't see Carl that way.

10:20.489 --> 10:21.751
We're just friends, that's it.

10:21.838 --> 10:23.187
I don't want anything
more than that,

10:23.274 --> 10:25.146
and I'm sure he doesn't, either.

10:25.233 --> 10:27.104
Okay, thanks.

10:31.326 --> 10:34.851
Carl sent you something.

10:34.938 --> 10:38.202
Probably just a friendship bear.

10:38.289 --> 10:40.378
Yeah.Read the card.

10:42.903 --> 10:45.035
"Victoria, if what we did
last night was wrong,

10:45.122 --> 10:48.212
"I don't want to be right.

10:48.299 --> 10:49.039
Press the paw."

10:49.126 --> 10:51.172
Don't press the paw.

10:51.259 --> 10:52.434
No, press the paw.

10:52.521 --> 10:53.565
Don't press the paw!

10:53.653 --> 10:54.305
Press it!Don't...

Just a bear.

11:09.364 --> 11:11.366

That's exactly
what I thought was gonna happen!

11:34.128 --> 11:35.477
Well, I didn't see
the bear coming.

11:35.564 --> 11:36.347
I really didn't.

11:36.434 --> 11:38.306
Now I'm gonna be dealing

11:38.393 --> 11:39.394
with a brokenhearted Carl.

11:39.481 --> 11:40.438
Do you know how much Norah Jones

11:40.525 --> 11:42.919
I'll have to listen to?

11:43.006 --> 11:44.442
Well, what do you
want me to do--

11:44.529 --> 11:46.140
force Victoria to like him?

11:46.227 --> 11:47.707
No, but it would be nice
if she didn't throw herself

11:47.794 --> 11:51.101
on top of every Tom, Dick
and Carl that comes along.

11:51.188 --> 11:53.495
Hey, Bub, there were
two people in that room!

11:53.582 --> 11:54.365
Well, he had no choice.
Carl's just a man.

11:54.452 --> 11:56.716
What could he do?

11:56.803 --> 11:58.369
What the hell is
that supposed to mean?

11:58.456 --> 12:00.720
It's a woman's job
to stop these things.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.373
Are you an idiot?

12:02.460 --> 12:03.853
Yes!

12:03.940 --> 12:04.854
I'm an idiot, Carl's an idiot.

12:04.941 --> 12:07.988
We're men. We're all idiots!

12:09.641 --> 12:11.121
I'm sleeping on the couch,
aren't I?

12:11.208 --> 12:13.733
Oh, you're smart enough
to figure that out.

12:25.440 --> 12:27.094
So, are you the one
that found the body?

12:27.181 --> 12:27.964
Yeah.

12:28.051 --> 12:30.053
Well, he's pretty old.

12:30.140 --> 12:31.968
It's looking
like it's natural causes.

12:32.055 --> 12:33.883
Yeah, poor guy.Mmm.

12:33.970 --> 12:37.060
You know, he kind of
promised me his TV.

12:37.147 --> 12:39.193
So, is there, uh, some
kind of paperwork,

12:39.280 --> 12:40.324
or should I just take it now?

12:40.411 --> 12:44.372
Out.

12:44.459 --> 12:46.417
Vulture.

12:48.289 --> 12:49.246
Uh, Victoria's
not returning my texts.

12:49.333 --> 12:51.901
Really? That's too bad.

12:51.988 --> 12:53.990
Hey, check his nightstand
for next-of-kin information.

12:54.077 --> 12:55.600
Yeah, sure thing.

12:55.687 --> 12:57.864
You-you think she's
upset about something?

12:57.951 --> 12:59.517
I don't know.
Would you be upset

12:59.604 --> 13:01.084
if a pink,
four-foot bear showed up

13:01.171 --> 13:02.303
at your house and started
singing that it loved you?

13:02.390 --> 13:05.567
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:05.654 --> 13:07.134
It sang, "I think I love you."

13:07.221 --> 13:09.527
I wanted to leave myself
some wiggle room.

13:09.614 --> 13:11.399
Carl, you went from zero to big,
singing bear in one day.

13:11.486 --> 13:14.881
You freaked everybody out.

13:14.968 --> 13:16.230
I don't care about "everybody."
I care about Victoria.

13:16.317 --> 13:17.884
What did she say?Oh, please.

13:17.971 --> 13:18.798
I'm just trying not to get
in the middle of this.

13:18.885 --> 13:20.321
Well, it's too late for that.

13:20.408 --> 13:21.801
Guys, can we hurry, please?

13:21.888 --> 13:24.760
He's old, he's dead,
mystery solved.

13:24.847 --> 13:26.849
Look, I know you don't approve,
but can't you just be my friend

13:26.936 --> 13:28.590
for a second, and tell me
what's going on with Victoria?

13:28.677 --> 13:29.939
You don't want to know.

13:30.026 --> 13:31.201
I'm a big boy.
I can handle it.

13:31.288 --> 13:31.811
I just want to know the truth.

13:31.898 --> 13:32.724
All right.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.378
It was a one-time thing.

13:34.465 --> 13:35.423
She's sorry it happened.

13:35.510 --> 13:36.598
And it's over.

13:36.685 --> 13:38.165
Liar!

13:38.252 --> 13:39.906
Oh.

13:39.993 --> 13:41.864
Carl, I'm just telling you
what she said.

13:41.951 --> 13:43.257
No, no, no, you just don't
want me to be happy.

13:43.344 --> 13:44.258
Why-why are you even talking?

13:44.345 --> 13:45.694
This is between me and Victoria.

13:45.781 --> 13:47.043
You need to stay the hell
out of our love life!

13:47.130 --> 13:49.567
There is no love life!Guys?

13:49.654 --> 13:50.960
This body can go straight
to a funeral home.

13:51.047 --> 13:52.483
And I know just the one.

13:52.570 --> 13:53.658
We're not going
to see Victoria.

13:53.745 --> 13:54.746
Oh, yes, we are.

13:54.834 --> 13:55.835
Tag 'em and bag 'em, boys.

13:55.922 --> 13:57.010
Me and that dead old man both

13:57.097 --> 13:59.969
are going to see an angel.

14:03.190 --> 14:05.148
Carl, stop!
Don't go in there.

14:05.235 --> 14:07.107
I need to hear it
from her, Mike.

14:07.194 --> 14:08.630
No, you don't.
You can just walk away,

14:08.717 --> 14:10.240
and pretend like
it never happened.

14:10.327 --> 14:12.764
Like that time I tracked
dog crap through the Sizzler.

14:14.636 --> 14:15.985
They replaced the carpets,

14:16.072 --> 14:20.337
but we still eat there
like nothing happened.

14:20.424 --> 14:22.905
And who's the dog doo
in this scenario?

14:22.992 --> 14:25.734
Your best friend or
your sister-in-law?

14:25.821 --> 14:27.475
I'm just saying it was
an unfortunate accident.

14:27.562 --> 14:29.303
You were
at an anniversary party,

14:29.390 --> 14:31.131
romance was in the air.

14:31.218 --> 14:32.436
And you went dancing
with a beautiful girl,

14:32.523 --> 14:34.003
got caught up in the moment.

14:34.090 --> 14:36.527
Why am I still talking to you?Because you know

14:36.614 --> 14:40.096
on the other side
of that door is heartbreak.

14:40.183 --> 14:41.402
Thanks for the pep talk, coach.

14:41.489 --> 14:45.058
Suit yourself. And Carl?

14:45.145 --> 14:47.147
I'll pull the car out front
so if you're crying,

14:47.234 --> 14:49.540
you can run right in,
and nobody'll see you.

14:49.627 --> 14:52.935
Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm not gonna need that.

14:53.022 --> 14:54.850
And by "front," you mean
those doors right outside?

14:54.937 --> 14:57.418
On the left side.Okay.

14:59.420 --> 15:02.640
[laughs]

15:02.727 --> 15:04.381
Hey.

15:04.468 --> 15:06.775
Hey, Carl.

15:06.862 --> 15:08.733
What you doing here?

15:08.820 --> 15:10.866
Uh, I was just escorting a body.

15:10.953 --> 15:12.694
Thought I'd pop by
and say hello.

15:12.781 --> 15:16.350
Sorry I haven't answered
any of your texts.

15:16.437 --> 15:18.743
I've been a little busy.

15:18.830 --> 15:20.528
Yeah, I know. I get it.
We're-we're all busy.

15:20.615 --> 15:23.052
Oh, and thank you
for the bear.

15:23.139 --> 15:23.531
Did you like it?

15:23.618 --> 15:26.273
No.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.101
Yeah, yeah, it was
a little over the top.

15:28.188 --> 15:30.016
Stupid idea.
[chuckles]

15:30.103 --> 15:31.321
Did you happen
to press the paw?

15:31.408 --> 15:32.453
I did.Good.

15:32.540 --> 15:34.368
Good, good.

15:34.455 --> 15:36.718
So...

15:36.805 --> 15:37.588
Listen, Carl.
[chuckles]Yeah.

15:37.675 --> 15:42.332
About the other night.

15:42.419 --> 15:43.681
I think things went
a little further

15:43.768 --> 15:46.597
than maybe they should have.

15:46.684 --> 15:48.295
Oh, yeah!

15:48.382 --> 15:49.861
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.255
I agree. I mean, in fact,
that's why I came here.

15:52.342 --> 15:53.691
Just to make sure
that, you know,

15:53.778 --> 15:55.345
things weren't weird between us.

15:55.432 --> 15:57.260
That's such a relief.Yeah.

15:57.347 --> 15:59.001
I mean, I would hate to think
that you thought that it was

15:59.088 --> 16:01.221
anything more
than a little drunken fling.

16:01.308 --> 16:02.483
Me? [scoffs]Yeah.

16:02.570 --> 16:04.006
[laughs, stammers]

16:04.093 --> 16:06.878
No, I-I knew exactly
what that night was.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.532
You sure?

16:08.619 --> 16:11.013
Yeah, yeah... yeah.

16:11.100 --> 16:13.711
No, not really.

16:13.798 --> 16:16.149
Oh, Carl.Look, I...

16:16.236 --> 16:17.106
Listen, I ain't
gonna lie, Victoria.

16:17.193 --> 16:18.412
I got a little excited. I...

16:18.499 --> 16:21.502
I felt we had
a real connection there.

16:21.589 --> 16:24.200
We do have a connection.

16:24.287 --> 16:27.073
You're practically family.Mm-hmm.

16:27.160 --> 16:29.771
And the last thing I want
to do is mess that up.

16:29.858 --> 16:31.251
No, you-you're right.

16:31.338 --> 16:32.730
I mean, nothing's worth
losing that.

16:32.817 --> 16:35.646
I guess I just needed
to hear it from you.

16:35.733 --> 16:38.998
Still friends?

16:39.085 --> 16:41.261
Always.

16:41.348 --> 16:42.262
[laughs]

16:42.349 --> 16:44.220
If I squeeze that,

16:44.307 --> 16:47.919
is a song gonna
come out?

16:48.007 --> 16:50.487
You're gonna have to squeeze
something else to get that.

16:50.574 --> 16:53.925
You're bad.

16:55.231 --> 16:57.538
Bring it in.

17:02.151 --> 17:03.848
Hey.

17:03.935 --> 17:05.720
Hey, yourself.

17:05.807 --> 17:07.635
Well, what are you,
what are you doing here?

17:07.722 --> 17:09.158
Going to lunch
with my sister.

17:09.245 --> 17:12.292
Because we're women,
and that's what we do.

17:13.815 --> 17:16.513
She's in there
talking to Carl.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.515
Oh.

17:18.602 --> 17:21.214
Yeah.

17:21.301 --> 17:24.304
Listen, I-I said

17:24.391 --> 17:25.740
some stupid things last night.

17:25.827 --> 17:26.958
Yeah, you did.

17:27.046 --> 17:30.005
You did.

17:30.092 --> 17:32.181
Come on, I'm trying
to apologize.

17:32.268 --> 17:33.748
Well, go on.

17:33.835 --> 17:37.447
I thought I was done.

17:37.534 --> 17:39.623
No, that was just
the introduction to the apology.

17:39.710 --> 17:42.931
Okay.

17:43.018 --> 17:46.500
I'm sorry that I said all
that man/woman stuff

17:46.587 --> 17:47.936
that I know better

17:48.023 --> 17:50.939
than to say in front of you.

17:53.724 --> 17:56.553
Close enough, that's...

17:56.640 --> 17:58.294
You're forgiven.

17:58.381 --> 17:59.556
Ah, best wife ever.

17:59.643 --> 18:00.862
You know, I really am.I know.

18:00.949 --> 18:03.256
[laughs]

18:03.343 --> 18:05.171
All right.

18:05.258 --> 18:06.694
You know, why don't
the four of us go to lunch,

18:06.781 --> 18:08.783
and get over this weird stuff?

18:08.870 --> 18:10.176
Tha-That'd be great.

18:10.263 --> 18:11.481
Right?Yeah.

18:11.568 --> 18:15.529
[screams, shouting]

18:15.616 --> 18:16.660
Aw, doing it in the morgue!
They're animals.

18:16.747 --> 18:18.619
Naked Carl! Naked Carl!

18:29.978 --> 18:32.285
Is he going to be
doing this all night?

18:32.372 --> 18:33.634
[sighs]
Just ignore it,

18:33.721 --> 18:37.072
and he'll get bored
and fly away.

18:37.159 --> 18:38.682
I didn't care
when it got caught in my hair,

18:38.769 --> 18:40.684
but if he knocks over my wine,

18:40.771 --> 18:42.164
there's gonna be
a Black Hawk down.

18:42.251 --> 18:46.212
Mike, you're getting
too close to the wine!

18:46.299 --> 18:47.735
It's not wine,
it's a volcano.

18:47.822 --> 18:50.738
And I'm trying to save
the villagers.

18:50.825 --> 18:53.175
If you want cheese and crackers,
just come and get them.

18:53.262 --> 18:53.871
Ah, it's more fun this way.

18:56.047 --> 18:58.137
Oh, son of a bitch!

18:58.224 --> 18:59.486
Don't hurt it!

18:59.573 --> 19:01.096
Blame the man, not the machine!

19:01.183 --> 19:03.272
Oh, I got it!
