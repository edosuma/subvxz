00:02.045 --> 00:04.464
<i>Previously on Marvel's</i>
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:04.547 --> 00:06.675
And not everyone
who can change should change.

00:06.758 --> 00:08.051
You sound like
one of those hate groups,

00:08.134 --> 00:09.177
"The Watchdogs."

00:09.260 --> 00:11.137
"Kill the aliens
and take back the planet."

00:11.221 --> 00:12.931
Help me. Please.

00:13.014 --> 00:14.808
You gotta let me out, Jemma.

00:15.517 --> 00:17.977
<i>I'm the only one
who can protect you.</i>

00:20.105 --> 00:21.856
<i>Where are Hunter and Bobbi?</i>

00:22.774 --> 00:24.484
<i>They're not coming back.
They've been disavowed.</i>

00:24.567 --> 00:27.070
<i>It was all we could do
to keep them from being executed.</i>

00:27.153 --> 00:28.238
<i>They did that for S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>

00:28.321 --> 00:30.573
<i>They did that for us,
and they paid the price.</i>

00:30.657 --> 00:34.202
Believe me, guys,
I'm gonna miss them, too.

00:48.758 --> 00:50.176
<i>...cutting to the hoop.</i>

00:50.260 --> 00:52.804
Sure that's
the right move, Alfie?

00:55.557 --> 00:57.100
You know what's not the right move?

00:57.183 --> 00:58.601
Calling me Alfie.

00:58.685 --> 01:01.020
Mom gets to. You don't.

01:02.731 --> 01:04.607
If you didn't ride this thing
like a damn maniac,

01:04.691 --> 01:07.235
I wouldn't have to come home
and repair it for you.

01:07.318 --> 01:08.903
You wish you rode like me.

01:08.987 --> 01:13.241
Yeah, please. You got nothing to ride
without that intake valve I brought you.

01:13.324 --> 01:14.743
I could always take it back.

01:14.826 --> 01:17.579
Okay. Well,
your Ironhead's in great shape,

01:17.662 --> 01:19.164
and you're never home
to ride it anyway.

01:19.289 --> 01:20.331
Maybe I ought to...

01:20.415 --> 01:23.084
Never ride my bike ever?
Yeah, I love that idea.

01:23.168 --> 01:25.837
I mean, I thought you were gonna
finally ride it when we drove to Baja.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.505
Oh, this again.

01:27.589 --> 01:30.341
Look, I told you, I got buried in work.

01:30.425 --> 01:32.343
All right, I'm sorry,
but we'll find a time.

01:32.427 --> 01:34.179
I understand.

01:34.304 --> 01:36.347
Being an insurance company drone
is super interesting.

01:36.473 --> 01:38.850
Why not bury yourself in that work?

01:38.975 --> 01:40.101
Funny.

01:40.185 --> 01:42.437
I was wishing
I was back at work right now.

01:43.855 --> 01:45.023
Seems like a pretty sweet gig

01:45.148 --> 01:47.859
if it gets you a hook-up
on an impossible-to-find intake valve.

01:48.860 --> 01:52.363
Yeah, honestly,
job hasn't been great lately.

01:52.697 --> 01:56.367
Management's out of control,
new people keep coming in every day,

01:56.868 --> 01:58.203
no experience.

01:58.870 --> 02:02.290
And the two friends I was closest to,
they just got

02:03.041 --> 02:05.502
transferred for good.

02:06.211 --> 02:08.797
Work buddies come and go.

02:08.880 --> 02:11.007
Now, family,
they're the ones you can't get rid of.

02:12.050 --> 02:15.804
Even if they set up a roadside stand
and tried selling you off to strangers.

02:15.887 --> 02:17.639
You were an awkward kid.

02:19.390 --> 02:20.725
I'm sorry about your work.

02:22.227 --> 02:23.895
I'm sorry about your layoff.

02:25.522 --> 02:27.816
But it's just a temporary setback.

02:37.742 --> 02:38.993
Why is this still here?

02:39.244 --> 02:41.579
When Mom and Dad left you the house,
they had to leave this, too?

02:41.663 --> 02:43.665
Dad wouldn't let Mom take it.

02:43.748 --> 02:44.874
I put it up on eBay.

02:45.166 --> 02:47.168
Turns out, not as
valuable as Mom thinks.

02:47.252 --> 02:49.087
Okay, so here's the plan.

02:49.170 --> 02:51.923
Lunch, beers, finish up the bike. Good?

02:52.006 --> 02:53.091
Good.

02:53.174 --> 02:54.425
I picked up a couple steaks.

02:54.551 --> 02:55.593
No, you didn't.

02:56.553 --> 02:58.346
- You gonna do your...
- Mmm-hmm.

02:58.763 --> 03:01.182
Aw, yeah.

03:03.101 --> 03:06.396
You could take a run at that,
you know, cooking.

03:06.604 --> 03:08.857
You're good. No, I'm serious.

03:09.524 --> 03:12.610
- Not as good as I am with engines, but...
- Oh.

03:12.902 --> 03:15.238
That was almost a compliment.

03:15.446 --> 03:17.282
So close.

03:19.784 --> 03:20.869
<i>Breaking news...</i>

03:20.952 --> 03:22.203
I've thought about it, but...

03:22.287 --> 03:24.706
<i>We have a shocking video that was
sent to our station minutes ago.</i>

03:24.789 --> 03:27.041
<i>This facility
is controlled by the ATCU.</i>

03:27.125 --> 03:28.710
<i>The government is keeping secrets,</i>

03:28.793 --> 03:31.212
<i>things we don't know
until cities fall out of the sky.</i>

03:31.296 --> 03:35.049
<i>The Avengers, more like them
every day, protected, hidden.</i>

03:35.133 --> 03:36.217
<i>Not any more!</i>

03:36.301 --> 03:38.052
<i>- We want this information released...</i>
- Whoa.

03:38.136 --> 03:40.638
<i>...a list of who they are, where they are.</i>

03:40.763 --> 03:42.390
<i>Or you will have war on your hands.</i>

03:44.309 --> 03:46.394
<i>We are the Watchdogs.</i>

03:46.477 --> 03:47.979
<i>You will obey.</i>

03:54.152 --> 03:56.279
<i>Let's go!</i>

04:10.168 --> 04:11.169
This is...

04:11.294 --> 04:12.337
Awesome.

04:13.922 --> 04:15.340
Right?

04:24.307 --> 04:25.683
<i>I need an agent
in South Bend,</i>

04:25.767 --> 04:27.518
<i>and you're the closest one
to the scene.</i>

04:27.602 --> 04:28.770
Right.

04:28.853 --> 04:30.605
It's just, I'm here with my brother,

04:30.688 --> 04:32.774
and I was hoping this week off
would be more of a...

04:32.857 --> 04:35.360
Thing is, Mack, I'm actually down
a couple of agents right now.

04:35.610 --> 04:36.861
I know, sir.

04:36.945 --> 04:38.947
My resources are limited.

04:39.030 --> 04:41.449
Local PD's already on the scene,
and you know the Feds are on a plane.

04:41.532 --> 04:42.533
Yes, but...

04:42.659 --> 04:44.452
They'll pick the site clean,
and we'll have nothing.

04:44.535 --> 04:46.037
They hit the ATCU, Mack.

04:46.120 --> 04:47.205
It's serious.

04:47.288 --> 04:49.624
<i>I'm sorry about family time,
but we all make sacrifices.</i>

04:49.707 --> 04:51.292
Figure it out.

04:56.881 --> 04:58.132
Hey, uh...

04:58.675 --> 05:01.219
So, uh, it looks like I have to take off
for a couple of hours.

05:01.886 --> 05:03.554
There was an accident on US 41.

05:03.680 --> 05:04.722
I got to go assess it.

05:04.806 --> 05:05.890
Now?

05:05.974 --> 05:07.308
Yeah.

05:07.392 --> 05:08.643
It's complicated.

05:08.726 --> 05:10.144
But this is simple.

05:10.979 --> 05:13.064
Lunch, beers, bike? Remember?

05:13.147 --> 05:15.149
We'll get to it. I promise.

05:18.820 --> 05:20.405
Were there casualties?

05:20.488 --> 05:22.073
The building had a staff.

05:22.156 --> 05:25.076
When you get to South Bend,
rendezvous with Mack at the ATCU site.

05:25.159 --> 05:26.202
Report back what you got.

05:26.285 --> 05:28.371
I've been following the Watchdogs
online for a while now.

05:28.454 --> 05:29.831
Some pretty nasty hate speech,

05:29.914 --> 05:31.457
but up until now, it's all been rhetoric.

05:31.541 --> 05:33.084
There's a bark/bite joke
I could make here,

05:33.167 --> 05:34.794
but I don't find these guys
all that funny.

05:34.877 --> 05:37.130
No, they've had a menacing presence
ever since New York.

05:37.213 --> 05:38.965
Got even less funny after Sokovia.

05:39.048 --> 05:41.175
Not exactly embracing
the new changes in the world.

05:41.259 --> 05:43.970
Now they're not happy
just being the comments section.

05:44.053 --> 05:46.848
Something's changed.
They're taking action.

05:46.931 --> 05:49.517
We need to shut them down
before more people get hurt.

05:50.268 --> 05:54.022
We've got enough on our plate
trying to track down Malick.

05:54.313 --> 05:55.440
Hey!

05:55.523 --> 05:56.607
Hey.

05:56.941 --> 05:58.526
How'd the S.H.I.E.L.D. assessment go?

05:58.609 --> 06:00.153
Fine, I think.

06:00.403 --> 06:03.364
I guess we won't know for sure
till Coulson gets the evaluation report.

06:03.448 --> 06:05.908
- I got it.
- Well, should we bring Lincoln with us?

06:05.992 --> 06:07.577
With Bobbi and Hunter gone,
we can use all the help...

06:07.660 --> 06:09.078
Lincoln's gonna sit this one out.

06:09.162 --> 06:10.204
You and Fitz go ahead.

06:10.288 --> 06:13.583
Meet up with Mack,
then report back to me.

06:13.875 --> 06:15.043
Okay.

06:18.004 --> 06:19.589
I will do that.

06:36.397 --> 06:39.609
We get it,
Watchdogs, you did this.

06:39.692 --> 06:40.818
Yeah.

06:41.652 --> 06:43.029
Did you ride that here?

06:43.112 --> 06:44.697
Uh-huh.
- Wow.

06:44.781 --> 06:46.324
You really are on vacation.

06:46.824 --> 06:48.910
Yeah. Vacation.

06:49.744 --> 06:51.662
All right, here's what we know so far.

06:51.746 --> 06:54.123
This facility was a storage site
for the ATCU.

06:54.207 --> 06:55.958
But somehow,
the Watchdogs found out.

06:56.042 --> 06:58.127
Hey! Hey.

06:59.420 --> 07:01.756
The residue from the bombs,
it's got Nitramene in it.

07:02.423 --> 07:05.093
I don't know what that is, but
your tone of voice makes it sound bad.

07:05.176 --> 07:07.553
Howard Stark developed it
after World War II.

07:07.637 --> 07:08.763
It causes implosions.

07:09.263 --> 07:10.473
Huh. That's weird.

07:10.556 --> 07:12.517
Weird how?
That they got their hands on it?

07:12.600 --> 07:15.812
Nitramene isn't stable enough
to be used in a gel-based explosive.

07:15.895 --> 07:17.063
Or at least it shouldn't be.

07:17.146 --> 07:19.732
So the Watchdogs have been
making improvements to Nitramene.

07:20.900 --> 07:22.401
- Just to be clear, Nitramene...
- Actually,

07:22.485 --> 07:24.779
I think I've got some sodium hydrogen
acetate back on Zephyr One.

07:24.862 --> 07:26.697
That'll help if we encounter
any more bombs, right.

07:26.781 --> 07:27.990
Sodium...

07:28.074 --> 07:29.700
Hydrogen acetate.

07:30.243 --> 07:31.619
- Neutralises Nitramene.
- Neutralises Nitramene.

07:31.702 --> 07:33.538
Okay. Thank you, Nerd Herd.

07:33.621 --> 07:35.748
I'm gonna go call Coulson.

07:37.291 --> 07:40.419
Do we take this debris
back with us, study it?

07:40.711 --> 07:43.840
Uh, yeah, sure.
If you've been working out.

07:44.507 --> 07:47.593
'Cause it weighs like 100,000 tons.

07:48.010 --> 07:49.679
It's a building.

07:50.805 --> 07:52.890
So... No, then.

07:55.393 --> 07:56.477
Nitramene.

07:56.561 --> 07:58.354
<i>Why does that mean something
to everyone else but me?</i>

07:58.437 --> 08:00.481
S.H.I.E.L.D. history.
Stark tech.

08:00.565 --> 08:03.860
And I knew somebody once who was
keen on improving the original formula.

08:03.943 --> 08:06.279
<i>Okay, well, is that enough to connect
that person to the Watchdogs?</i>

08:06.362 --> 08:08.406
He was fixated on it.

08:08.489 --> 08:10.950
Thought it might be something
we could add to our arsenal.

08:11.868 --> 08:13.327
<i>Our arsenal?</i>

08:13.786 --> 08:15.830
<i>Are you saying this could be
a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent?</i>

08:15.913 --> 08:17.456
A S.H.I.E.L.D. agent you've met.

08:17.915 --> 08:21.752
<i>A good man, but he went off the grid
when he got out of the hospital,</i>

08:21.836 --> 08:24.422
<i>which means he's at large
with a lot of our secrets.</i>

08:24.505 --> 08:26.174
<i>He was in the hospital?</i>

08:26.257 --> 08:28.509
<i>After Deathlok
broke his spine.</i>

08:28.593 --> 08:30.720
Nice work out there, boys.

08:31.804 --> 08:33.472
<i>Felix Blake.</i>

08:33.556 --> 08:36.601
Gentlemen,
I've got a new plan of attack.

08:37.351 --> 08:39.562
And it's a good one.

08:50.781 --> 08:52.533
Someone's been practising.

08:53.117 --> 08:55.912
You know I don't like guns,
but I'd rather be prepared.

08:55.995 --> 08:57.163
Good.

08:57.246 --> 08:58.873
You're holding your breath, though.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.417
Exhale when you pull the trigger.

09:01.500 --> 09:02.752
Thanks.

09:04.170 --> 09:06.088
Want to tell me what this is about?

09:06.172 --> 09:07.465
Do I need to?

09:08.507 --> 09:10.426
You don't like feeling vulnerable.

09:10.509 --> 09:11.677
Sick of blaming yourself for...

09:11.761 --> 09:14.138
No, I'm quite comfortable
blaming myself, actually,

09:14.222 --> 09:15.765
for the lot of it.

09:15.848 --> 09:19.060
For all the miseries endured to rescue
helpless little Agent Simmons.

09:20.895 --> 09:22.730
Will died trying to save me.

09:22.813 --> 09:24.232
And Fitz...

09:24.690 --> 09:26.692
Poor Fitz nearly got himself killed
a number of times,

09:26.776 --> 09:29.320
and that's not even the worst of it.

09:29.612 --> 09:30.988
Andrew.

09:33.282 --> 09:36.244
What happened to those Inhumans,
not your fault.

09:36.327 --> 09:39.372
No, I just let a known murderer loose
to save my own skin.

09:39.455 --> 09:41.207
Traded all those...

09:41.749 --> 09:44.001
Those lives for mine.

09:44.085 --> 09:45.836
Well, it won't happen again.

09:45.920 --> 09:47.463
And since I'm practically
the only woman here

09:47.546 --> 09:50.258
who can't kill with her bare hands...

09:52.677 --> 09:54.178
Listen to me.

09:55.054 --> 09:57.056
That wasn't your fault.

10:11.153 --> 10:14.240
What makes them go from
anonymous trash-talking online to...

10:14.323 --> 10:15.992
Domestic terrorism?

10:16.075 --> 10:18.995
Maybe someone stepped in
and radicalized them. Maybe Blake.

10:19.078 --> 10:20.162
I understand feeling lost.

10:20.246 --> 10:22.081
You want to hate something.

10:22.164 --> 10:24.417
Hate gives you direction.
That could be dangerous.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.294
Hey, I used to hate all this alien crap.

10:28.045 --> 10:29.338
Used to.

10:30.006 --> 10:31.674
But my brother thinks that way.

10:31.757 --> 10:34.218
I mean, he's a good guy, but even
he's cheering on the Watchdogs.

10:34.302 --> 10:35.553
They're not...

10:35.636 --> 10:37.221
They're not that anonymous.

10:37.305 --> 10:38.389
I've been tracking them,

10:38.472 --> 10:40.224
the ones that are spewing hate online.

10:40.766 --> 10:43.728
You know, IP addresses, residences,
licence-plate numbers,

10:43.811 --> 10:45.062
some of them are local.

10:45.146 --> 10:46.772
They could've been involved
in the ATCU attack.

10:46.856 --> 10:49.025
We should go pick one up
and see what he knows.

10:49.859 --> 10:51.944
And what?

10:52.028 --> 10:53.195
Shake him down?

10:53.279 --> 10:56.073
Without even knowing if the guy
we picked was actually involved?

10:56.157 --> 10:57.742
Well, either way, he'll know something.

10:58.117 --> 11:01.329
Yeah, but it's kind of Gestapo,
don't you think?

11:01.412 --> 11:02.538
Is that who we are?

11:02.621 --> 11:04.123
We're S.H.I.E.L.D.

11:04.206 --> 11:05.416
I'm trying to save lives.

11:05.499 --> 11:07.084
I'll use whatever
advantage I have to do it.

11:07.168 --> 11:09.670
Yeah, the advantage of superpowers,
which is something I don't have.

11:09.920 --> 11:12.923
But I'm not so sure you should be
using yours to sidestep civil liberties.

11:13.007 --> 11:14.925
They gave up their right
to civil liberties

11:15.009 --> 11:16.761
when they started imploding buildings.

11:16.844 --> 11:18.304
Maybe, but it's not about how they act.

11:18.387 --> 11:19.930
It's about how we respond.

11:24.310 --> 11:26.604
All right, look,
I'm not going along with this.

11:28.647 --> 11:31.442
Besides,
I made a promise to my brother.

11:32.943 --> 11:35.112
Okay, Fitz, you're with me.

11:35.613 --> 11:38.824
Uh, am I?

11:42.036 --> 11:43.954
You're looking for me?

11:45.164 --> 11:46.415
Yeah.

11:46.499 --> 11:48.417
Former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Felix Blake.

11:48.501 --> 11:51.337
While he's out there causing casualties,
he's our top priority.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.631
Okay. How can I...

11:53.714 --> 11:54.965
I worked with the guy.

11:55.049 --> 11:56.634
I know a few things
he doesn't know I know.

11:56.717 --> 11:58.094
You mean, that'll help you find him.

11:58.177 --> 11:59.637
Everyone has safe houses.

11:59.720 --> 12:00.888
Unbeknownst to Blake,

12:00.971 --> 12:04.517
I happen to know where a few of his are,
and that's not to help me find him.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.060
It's to help us find him.

12:07.144 --> 12:08.312
Wait.

12:08.396 --> 12:09.688
You're saying I'm going, too.

12:09.772 --> 12:12.233
I am. If we can find any evidence
he left behind of his plans,

12:12.316 --> 12:13.692
we can stop him.

12:13.776 --> 12:14.860
Okay.

12:14.944 --> 12:16.987
Great. I mean,

12:17.071 --> 12:19.782
you didn't say anything
about my evaluation, so...

12:19.865 --> 12:22.493
You know, it just seemed like
you weren't happy with what you saw.

12:22.576 --> 12:23.869
I'm not.

12:24.995 --> 12:26.872
But I want to see it for myself.

12:32.545 --> 12:34.255
Saving the world,

12:34.588 --> 12:39.176
one diligently assessed
insurance claim at a time.

12:39.260 --> 12:42.012
The gecko and his sidekick, Alfie.

12:42.471 --> 12:43.889
Oh, wait.

12:43.973 --> 12:47.726
You work for the lady
with the funny hair. I always forget.

12:47.935 --> 12:49.520
So I guess you had your beers.

12:49.603 --> 12:50.688
And yours, too.

12:50.771 --> 12:52.356
You weren't drinking 'em.

12:52.440 --> 12:54.191
I get that you're upset.

12:55.192 --> 12:56.360
But...

12:56.444 --> 12:57.736
All right, look,

12:57.820 --> 12:59.488
you got to make sure
the valve seats right...

12:59.572 --> 13:01.657
It's not about the damn bikes!

13:02.741 --> 13:04.660
Okay. Then what's it about?

13:06.245 --> 13:07.413
Nothing, man.

13:07.496 --> 13:09.206
Nothing? Really?

13:09.999 --> 13:11.876
So you're just being a jackass
for no reason?

13:11.959 --> 13:14.211
There's just a lot going on.

13:16.338 --> 13:18.549
Health benefits are about to run out.

13:18.632 --> 13:21.135
There's zero jobs out there.
The mortgage isn't in great shape.

13:21.218 --> 13:23.179
Wait, wait a minute.

13:23.262 --> 13:24.972
What about the mortgage?

13:26.849 --> 13:28.434
I'm upside down.

13:28.642 --> 13:30.561
Oh, damn it.

13:30.853 --> 13:32.521
I've been trying, okay?

13:32.605 --> 13:34.482
But I was already struggling,
then the layoffs happened...

13:34.565 --> 13:36.734
Wait, wait, wait. So is that why
you've been on me to hang out?

13:36.817 --> 13:38.444
You know, get some brother time,
go to Baja.

13:38.527 --> 13:39.862
What, you just wanted to
ask me for money?

13:39.945 --> 13:41.697
No! I suggested Baja because

13:41.780 --> 13:43.574
we've been talking about it
since we were kids.

13:43.657 --> 13:45.201
And, by the way,

13:45.284 --> 13:48.120
I never asked for money.
I'll handle it.

13:48.913 --> 13:50.206
Like I handle everything,

13:50.289 --> 13:51.665
like with Mom and Dad...

13:51.749 --> 13:52.875
I help out.

13:52.958 --> 13:54.793
I helped you move them into the condo.

13:54.877 --> 13:56.837
You showed up three days
after I moved them in.

13:56.921 --> 13:59.048
Even now, I'm the one
that has to keep everything here afloat.

13:59.131 --> 14:00.424
We can't all just run off to some other...

14:00.508 --> 14:02.051
No one put a gun to your head!

14:02.134 --> 14:03.844
You didn't have to take this house.
You could've sold it.

14:03.928 --> 14:05.179
But I didn't.

14:05.262 --> 14:06.764
And now I'm in default.

14:06.847 --> 14:09.350
I can't afford the house.
I can't afford to leave.

14:09.433 --> 14:11.060
This is how they get you.

14:11.143 --> 14:12.353
System's rigged.

14:12.645 --> 14:14.939
They want to keep you down
in the dark, man.

14:15.022 --> 14:16.524
They.

14:16.607 --> 14:18.442
You sound like those Watchdog nuts.

14:18.526 --> 14:21.362
Well, they got the right idea.

14:21.445 --> 14:23.030
Someone's got to fight back.

14:23.113 --> 14:25.074
The government controls everything.

14:25.199 --> 14:28.118
"You either rise up in protest,
or you fall down in chains."

14:28.202 --> 14:30.287
That's a direct quote.

14:30.663 --> 14:32.081
Are you reading their stuff?

14:32.164 --> 14:33.624
I go online.

14:34.416 --> 14:36.961
They get what I'm going through.
You don't.

14:37.044 --> 14:38.379
You're only here
'cause your friends left.

14:38.462 --> 14:40.506
You stay away from the Watchdogs!

14:40.589 --> 14:42.299
You hear me? They're not the answer.

14:42.383 --> 14:43.425
No?

14:43.551 --> 14:44.718
Well, what is the answer?

14:44.969 --> 14:46.095
You?

14:57.147 --> 14:59.233
Simmons. Here.

15:01.986 --> 15:04.071
Everything I have.

15:05.406 --> 15:07.241
You're pursuing Andrew.

15:07.324 --> 15:09.868
And I've re-tasked a group of
S.H.I.E.L.D. servers to look for him.

15:10.244 --> 15:11.954
I can't imagine how hard this must...

15:12.037 --> 15:13.080
Has to be done.

15:13.163 --> 15:15.499
Because Andrew is dangerous.

15:15.583 --> 15:17.126
You're not responsible.

15:17.418 --> 15:19.003
He is.

15:19.086 --> 15:21.630
I just feel guilty, all the time.

15:22.256 --> 15:23.841
How do you make it stop?

15:24.300 --> 15:25.676
You don't.

15:26.010 --> 15:28.345
You use it, channel it.

15:28.429 --> 15:29.930
Is that what you're doing?

15:34.018 --> 15:35.269
I can help.

15:35.352 --> 15:37.438
Was hoping you would.

15:39.356 --> 15:41.442
Oh, you're doing this wrong.

15:41.817 --> 15:44.737
I mean, you're looking
in the wrong place.

15:51.535 --> 15:53.996
So, uh, this Blake guy,

15:54.622 --> 15:57.166
he has safe houses, what, all over?

15:57.249 --> 15:58.375
All agents do.

15:58.459 --> 16:01.086
We'll just have to keep checking his
until we find something.

16:04.840 --> 16:08.260
So, what did it say on my evaluation?

16:09.845 --> 16:11.305
Nothing that'll surprise you.

16:11.847 --> 16:14.183
You're here for Daisy, not the cause.

16:14.266 --> 16:16.352
So commitment is a question.

16:16.435 --> 16:18.062
But I am here.

16:19.605 --> 16:22.274
And your control issues
didn't stop with AA.

16:22.358 --> 16:24.610
You went nuclear on Lash, on Creel.

16:24.693 --> 16:26.153
I had reasons both times.

16:26.236 --> 16:27.696
But you didn't follow orders.

16:27.946 --> 16:29.490
You can't just be at S.H.I.E.L.D.

16:29.573 --> 16:30.783
You have to be a part of S.H.I.E.L.D.

16:30.866 --> 16:33.661
And I'm trying to be,
but you don't make it easy.

16:33.744 --> 16:36.372
There's a test at every turn.
I mean, this is a test.

16:36.497 --> 16:39.124
This is a chance for me to see
for myself how you handle things.

16:39.208 --> 16:42.336
- Same thing, different words...
- Don't interrupt me! You got it?

16:42.628 --> 16:45.005
You haven't earned that right yet.

16:45.589 --> 16:47.216
I don't know you.

16:47.299 --> 16:49.885
I vetted every member of this team
except you,

16:49.968 --> 16:51.720
measured their commitment
to this ideal,

16:51.804 --> 16:55.891
including two good agents who just
gave it all up to protect that ideal.

16:56.767 --> 16:58.394
I think you could be a good agent,

16:58.477 --> 17:02.523
but I need to know if you think that
and that you want it badly enough.

17:02.606 --> 17:04.858
So you stay in control
and you follow my orders,

17:04.942 --> 17:07.236
and I'll decide
if you get to be an agent or not.

17:07.319 --> 17:08.654
Understood?

17:10.531 --> 17:11.865
Yes, sir.

17:17.413 --> 17:19.915
<i>I'm just
saying, first, it was the illegal aliens.</i>

17:19.998 --> 17:23.042
<i>Now it's actual aliens
putting us all at risk.</i>

17:23.127 --> 17:24.920
- Mmm-hmm.
<i>- And we do need to be tracking them.</i>

17:25.002 --> 17:26.505
<i>We have to take our country back.</i>

17:38.517 --> 17:39.810
What the hell?

17:49.945 --> 17:51.155
Hi, Dallas.

17:51.530 --> 17:52.948
How do you know who I am?

17:54.408 --> 17:56.952
You think I can't find out who you are
when you're online

17:57.035 --> 18:02.166
talking about rounding up freaks
just because we're not face-to-face?

18:08.088 --> 18:11.717
Now we're face-to-face,
and I'm one of the freaks.

18:13.510 --> 18:15.846
But I guess that part was clear.

18:19.600 --> 18:21.852
I know they've contacted you.

18:21.935 --> 18:24.021
Want you to take action,

18:24.104 --> 18:26.106
and no doubt, you've chickened out,

18:26.190 --> 18:29.026
but I need you to tell me
where they meet.

18:29.818 --> 18:31.195
I'm not telling you anything.

18:34.865 --> 18:36.116
Please.

18:36.950 --> 18:38.202
Please.

18:38.786 --> 18:40.871
Please, don't hurt me.

18:41.789 --> 18:44.333
I won't have to
if you tell me what I want to know.

18:50.297 --> 18:51.590
So talk.

18:54.843 --> 18:57.471
They're all gathered
at a place called Easterling Farms.

18:57.554 --> 18:58.972
They're prepping for their next attack.

18:59.056 --> 19:00.849
How'd you get the information?

19:01.433 --> 19:03.352
I found someone who was willing to talk.

19:04.102 --> 19:05.479
<i>Look, the point is, if we leave now,</i>

19:05.562 --> 19:07.064
we can stop anyone else
from getting hurt.

19:07.147 --> 19:08.273
That's still the mission, isn't it?

19:08.357 --> 19:10.067
Easterling Farms.

19:10.150 --> 19:13.695
That's over in Lake County, right?

19:13.779 --> 19:15.322
Yeah. I'll text you the location.

19:15.405 --> 19:16.740
I'll meet you there.

19:16.824 --> 19:19.493
There's nothing for me
to do here anyway.

19:25.582 --> 19:26.708
Hey, Ruben.

19:28.377 --> 19:29.711
I didn't know you were home.

19:29.795 --> 19:31.255
I went out.

19:31.630 --> 19:33.090
For a bit.

19:33.799 --> 19:36.760
Well, I, uh... I laid out all
the parts for the bike.

19:37.052 --> 19:38.345
They're in the right order.

19:38.428 --> 19:39.930
All you have to do is install them.

19:40.472 --> 19:41.723
Thanks.

19:43.016 --> 19:44.393
I'm making lunch.

19:44.768 --> 19:46.061
Bolognese.

19:46.353 --> 19:47.938
Veal and pork, if you want some.

19:48.021 --> 19:49.231
Sounds good,

19:50.566 --> 19:52.359
but I have a thing, so...

20:03.662 --> 20:05.163
Andrew isn't like
your other targets.

20:05.247 --> 20:07.916
He's an Inhuman,
and an unusual one at that.

20:08.750 --> 20:11.253
Andrew, or Lash, really,

20:11.336 --> 20:13.589
is perhaps being
driven by different factors,

20:13.672 --> 20:15.883
biological imperatives, for instance.

20:15.966 --> 20:18.427
Climate, feeding,
even his need to seek out...

20:20.137 --> 20:21.722
Seek out intended victims.

20:21.805 --> 20:22.931
Yes.

20:23.432 --> 20:25.100
He's being driven by base instincts.

20:27.644 --> 20:30.939
So you're saying I should think
less like a spy, more like a doctor.

20:31.023 --> 20:32.316
Exactly.

20:34.484 --> 20:37.070
May, what happens to Andrew
when you catch up to him?

20:37.154 --> 20:39.865
After everything, I'm going to kill him.

20:40.282 --> 20:42.367
- He's left us no choice.
- What if there is a choice?

20:43.285 --> 20:44.369
There's not.

20:45.454 --> 20:46.580
May,

20:48.457 --> 20:50.500
Fitz and I have been working
on the vaccine from Creel's blood.

20:50.584 --> 20:53.420
Now, it would only work on Inhumans
who haven't turned yet,

20:53.503 --> 20:56.423
but Andrew hasn't
finished his transition.

20:57.716 --> 20:59.718
Shouldn't we at least try?

21:01.303 --> 21:02.387
No.

21:06.350 --> 21:08.810
Don't give me hope, Jemma.

21:09.394 --> 21:11.480
I don't want hope.

21:17.611 --> 21:21.114
It'd be nice if we weren't
quite so out in the open.

21:22.658 --> 21:24.326
Speaking of...

21:32.000 --> 21:33.126
Hey.

21:36.254 --> 21:39.174
Let's see what the Watchdogs look like
in their natural habitat.

21:55.315 --> 21:57.234
...<i>which means
only designated team captains</i>

21:57.317 --> 21:59.861
<i>will carry a full tactical pack.</i>

21:59.945 --> 22:03.031
<i>Know your captain,
and if you get in trouble, signal him.</i>

22:03.115 --> 22:04.700
That's Blake's voice.

22:04.783 --> 22:06.868
That's him. He's here.

22:31.685 --> 22:33.645
What are we looking for?

22:34.604 --> 22:36.940
Anything that might be evidence
of what Blake is doing.

22:40.110 --> 22:41.528
You hear that?

22:48.952 --> 22:50.454
<i>We don't want
to hurt innocents.</i>

22:50.537 --> 22:52.039
Still trying to get eyes on Blake.

22:52.122 --> 22:53.957
<i>You have permission
to defend yourself.</i>

22:54.583 --> 22:57.335
<i>The mission comes first.</i>

22:59.129 --> 23:00.172
Ruben.

23:05.218 --> 23:06.553
Al, look!

23:06.636 --> 23:08.430
- Ruben, go home. Go home!
- Good as new!

23:10.682 --> 23:12.059
What're you doing?

23:12.142 --> 23:13.560
- What does he think you do?
- Insurance.

23:13.643 --> 23:15.479
Well, not any more, I wager.

23:15.562 --> 23:16.772
Mack, we've got to get him out of here.

23:33.830 --> 23:35.123
Did you see what that guy just did?

23:35.207 --> 23:36.708
I'll tell the boss.

23:41.505 --> 23:42.839
We're done. Go to black.

23:42.923 --> 23:44.132
No, no, we can still...

23:44.216 --> 23:45.926
There are too many! Go to black!

23:46.009 --> 23:48.261
Are you good to get out of here?
I've got to go put a lid on this.

23:48.345 --> 23:50.388
Yeah. Yeah, we got it.

24:03.819 --> 24:04.861
Go.

24:05.237 --> 24:07.823
Wait, wait, wait! What're you doing?
We said we'd fall back.

24:07.906 --> 24:09.908
I have a shot at stopping Blake.
I'm taking it.

24:10.033 --> 24:12.119
Call the module. I'll be back.

24:19.167 --> 24:21.002
Let's go! Let's go!

24:21.086 --> 24:22.337
Move it!

24:22.420 --> 24:23.880
Come on! Come on!

24:23.964 --> 24:25.674
Where are you, Blake?

24:26.383 --> 24:28.468
It's like he disappeared.

24:39.020 --> 24:40.230
Blake?

24:41.439 --> 24:42.607
How are you here?

24:42.691 --> 24:44.359
I'm everywhere, Coulson.

24:44.442 --> 24:45.944
As are you, apparently.

24:46.236 --> 24:47.821
You recovered well.

24:47.988 --> 24:50.740
Says the man
who came back from the dead.

24:50.824 --> 24:53.869
I guess we both have a few tricks
up our sleeve, old friend.

24:59.124 --> 25:00.167
Ah!

25:04.880 --> 25:06.047
Fitz!

25:06.131 --> 25:07.299
Fitz!

25:09.050 --> 25:10.844
What's the stuff called?

25:10.927 --> 25:12.304
- Sodium what?
- Sodium hydrogen acetate.

25:22.230 --> 25:23.398
What?

25:23.481 --> 25:24.858
I don't think it's working.

25:24.941 --> 25:27.235
Maybe we slowed it down,

25:28.195 --> 25:30.488
but must be the modifications
that Blake made.

25:30.572 --> 25:31.740
What does that mean?

25:31.823 --> 25:34.201
That sooner or later,
this bomb is gonna go off.

25:34.284 --> 25:37.162
And then I'll implode.

25:38.663 --> 25:40.749
Which is gonna be messy.

25:44.502 --> 25:47.797
So here we are, reunited at last.

25:47.881 --> 25:49.466
I got to admit,

25:50.175 --> 25:51.468
it's not what I'd hoped for.

25:51.551 --> 25:55.597
I really thought it'd be ATCU proper
who showed up at the compound.

25:56.056 --> 25:57.307
Didn't expect you.

25:57.390 --> 25:58.975
I'm working with the ATCU.

25:59.059 --> 26:00.936
You mean keeping S.H.I.E.L.D.
alive within it.

26:01.019 --> 26:05.982
Those survival instincts of yours,
Coulson, always impressive.

26:06.066 --> 26:07.609
I searched for you.

26:07.692 --> 26:09.486
I wanted to make you
part of the new S.H.I.E.L.D.

26:09.569 --> 26:10.820
Yeah, well,
when I got out of the hospital,

26:10.904 --> 26:12.864
it turned out there had
never been a S.H.I.E.L.D.,

26:12.948 --> 26:14.658
just HYDRA hiding behind one.

26:14.741 --> 26:18.620
I signed up to protect the world
from these dangerous alien elements.

26:18.703 --> 26:20.538
- We still do that.
- The hell you do.

26:20.622 --> 26:22.374
You use them, unleash them.

26:22.457 --> 26:25.293
You've got those freaks working for you.

26:25.752 --> 26:28.296
Hell, Phil, you are one.

26:29.172 --> 26:30.340
Makes me sick.

26:30.423 --> 26:32.425
We both know S.H.I.E.L.D.
protects mankind.

26:32.509 --> 26:35.428
And what has S.H.I.E.L.D.
done in the name of protection?

26:35.512 --> 26:36.972
We brought the Chitauri to Earth.

26:37.055 --> 26:39.599
I was taken out
by one of your cybernetic recruits.

26:39.683 --> 26:41.559
And the latest and greatest idea?

26:42.269 --> 26:44.229
The Avengers created Ultron.

26:44.312 --> 26:45.689
What are you doing, Blake?

26:45.772 --> 26:47.607
I'm trying to make the world
a safer place...

26:47.691 --> 26:50.902
No. What are you doing now? Here?

26:50.986 --> 26:52.320
I know your tactics.

26:52.404 --> 26:54.531
Speeches? Not one of them.

26:55.031 --> 26:57.284
You're stalling. Why?

27:00.078 --> 27:02.622
Everyone stay back!
Clear the area!

27:04.249 --> 27:05.625
- It's digging into your skin.
- Yep.

27:05.709 --> 27:07.544
I'm very well-aware,
so cutting it off

27:07.627 --> 27:08.753
- is not an option.
- I'll quake it off.

27:08.837 --> 27:11.214
No, no, no! It's too unstable.

27:11.965 --> 27:14.175
Okay, I don't want to get her involved,

27:14.259 --> 27:15.343
but I think we should phone Simmons.

27:15.427 --> 27:17.512
We've got a better way to get the info.

27:21.933 --> 27:24.686
Okay. I was wondering
why you brought him here.

27:24.769 --> 27:26.271
What did your people put in the bomb?

27:27.439 --> 27:28.648
Tell us what you did!

27:28.732 --> 27:30.400
I don't know.

27:33.028 --> 27:34.654
Talk or implode.

27:35.739 --> 27:36.865
It was you.

27:36.948 --> 27:38.783
You're not getting out of here
until you give us answers.

27:40.243 --> 27:42.078
I don't know. I'm not a scientist.

27:42.162 --> 27:43.538
Yeah, obviously.

27:43.621 --> 27:46.499
Whatever Blake did to suspend
the stuff in there, he didn't tell me.

27:46.583 --> 27:48.293
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hang on. "Suspend."

27:48.376 --> 27:51.087
That's a science word
that he wouldn't know.

27:51.171 --> 27:52.213
The Nitramene is suspended.

27:52.297 --> 27:54.174
It's like a vaccination.
That's why we can't get to it.

27:54.257 --> 27:56.176
What do we do?

27:56.593 --> 27:59.929
We need to stop the substance
housing the Nitramene.

28:00.013 --> 28:02.098
It's a liquid, so...

28:02.182 --> 28:03.558
- We could freeze it.
- How?

28:03.641 --> 28:04.768
Liquid nitrogen. There's...

28:04.851 --> 28:06.644
We use it in the cooling jets
on the containment module.

28:06.728 --> 28:08.146
There's a panel in the corner!

28:13.568 --> 28:15.904
Your team in Indiana, very industrious.

28:15.987 --> 28:17.739
Problem is, that's just one cell.

28:17.822 --> 28:19.741
This is nationwide.

28:22.577 --> 28:23.995
Tell me something.

28:24.079 --> 28:26.289
How'd you get that ATCU target?

28:26.373 --> 28:27.749
Was it fed to you?

28:27.832 --> 28:30.293
This has HYDRA's fingerprints
all over it.

28:30.377 --> 28:32.879
Don't you see? You were probably
cleaning up some mess of theirs.

28:32.962 --> 28:35.215
How did you get the location
of our compound?

28:35.548 --> 28:36.883
Coercion, by any chance?

28:36.966 --> 28:38.843
I'm sure it was all aboveboard.

28:38.927 --> 28:40.845
We're solving problems,
not making them.

28:40.929 --> 28:42.180
We're spreading an idea.

28:42.263 --> 28:43.932
You spread fear.

28:44.557 --> 28:46.393
People are already afraid,

28:46.476 --> 28:47.852
and they want the truth.

28:47.936 --> 28:49.229
What you're doing's not about truth.

28:49.312 --> 28:51.314
- It's about hate.
- And you're above that?

28:51.398 --> 28:54.567
You've never just killed someone
because you hate them, Phil?

28:57.153 --> 28:58.780
Hate's a good motivator.

28:59.864 --> 29:01.491
You're not wrong.

29:01.574 --> 29:02.992
This guy?

29:03.493 --> 29:04.994
He's also filled with hate,

29:05.078 --> 29:07.622
and he happens to be
one of the Inhumans

29:07.705 --> 29:09.374
you're railing against.

29:09.457 --> 29:11.668
Really? Interesting.

29:11.751 --> 29:14.003
He wants to hurt you, badly.

29:14.087 --> 29:15.713
In fact, the only reason he's not

29:15.797 --> 29:18.341
is because he's trying really hard
to follow my orders.

29:18.425 --> 29:19.592
So...

29:20.385 --> 29:22.053
I'm changing my orders.

29:22.137 --> 29:23.430
What?

29:24.180 --> 29:26.224
Don't hurt Agent Blake.

29:26.516 --> 29:28.017
Kill him.

29:28.101 --> 29:29.436
Sir?

29:30.728 --> 29:31.938
That's an order.

29:32.021 --> 29:34.023
Sir, there's got to be another way.

29:34.107 --> 29:36.818
Uh-oh, Coulson. Seems your puppy
doesn't have his teeth yet.

29:37.735 --> 29:39.988
Lincoln, sometimes
we do the wrong thing

29:40.071 --> 29:42.449
for the right reason
because it has to be done.

29:42.532 --> 29:44.451
- Now take him out.
- Oh, no.

29:44.534 --> 29:45.952
Dissent among the ranks...

29:50.874 --> 29:52.459
What the...

29:54.085 --> 29:57.505
- He was a hologram.
- Uh-huh.

29:59.382 --> 30:01.301
Okay. Here we go.

30:03.553 --> 30:04.637
You ready?

30:13.146 --> 30:14.564
Okay.

30:14.689 --> 30:16.274
It's working.

30:17.484 --> 30:20.195
Fitz. It's working!

30:31.664 --> 30:34.125
I'm turning you over to the ATCU.

30:34.209 --> 30:36.961
I have a feeling General Talbot
will have some questions for you.

30:39.380 --> 30:40.673
You knew he wasn't really here.

30:41.341 --> 30:42.717
Yeah, he wasn't moving much.

30:42.800 --> 30:46.846
There was also a lag.
Blake usually interrupts you a lot more.

30:46.930 --> 30:48.973
I also know that wasn't a kill shot.

30:49.057 --> 30:50.558
I saw you with Lash.

30:52.101 --> 30:53.144
Yeah, I just...

30:53.228 --> 30:54.479
You played it right.

30:54.562 --> 30:55.730
Offered a dissenting opinion,

30:55.813 --> 30:58.316
but when the time came,
you did what I asked.

30:58.399 --> 31:01.694
Well, a slightly less lethal version.

31:01.778 --> 31:03.154
Well done.

31:04.072 --> 31:05.448
We should go through this place,

31:05.532 --> 31:07.242
find out if there really is
a second target.

31:07.951 --> 31:10.036
Blake will send his men.

31:21.881 --> 31:23.049
Who are you?

31:23.383 --> 31:25.635
I know it's a lot to take in,
but if we could talk about it...

31:25.718 --> 31:26.970
Oh, sure. Now you want to talk.

31:27.679 --> 31:30.014
I can't believe you,
helping those freaks...

31:30.098 --> 31:31.516
Look, that's not what they are.
They're Inhumans.

31:31.599 --> 31:33.768
- "Inhumans?" What in the hell does...
- Nothing to be afraid of.

31:33.851 --> 31:35.937
They're people!
And they're being hunted.

31:36.020 --> 31:38.982
You know, the really stupid part is,
I was actually gonna apologise to you

31:39.691 --> 31:41.234
for not telling you about the house,

31:41.317 --> 31:42.986
for hiding things. God, I'm an idiot.

31:43.069 --> 31:44.362
The reason I didn't tell you
is because I...

31:44.445 --> 31:46.072
Stop talking!

31:46.781 --> 31:49.617
You're a liar. It's all lies.

31:55.248 --> 31:56.958
Daisy should be able to access these.

31:57.041 --> 31:58.626
If they're preparing for a second target,

31:58.710 --> 32:00.003
he was stalling.

32:00.086 --> 32:01.254
But why?

32:01.337 --> 32:04.048
To keep us distracted, but from what?

32:04.340 --> 32:06.050
From talking to our people?

32:06.134 --> 32:08.553
But we'd already sent agents to his...

32:08.636 --> 32:10.305
To his compound.

32:11.180 --> 32:14.475
Blake kept talking about you
working with freaks.

32:14.726 --> 32:17.687
He must've known that
you'd send some of us on the raid.

32:17.770 --> 32:19.480
He didn't have a second target.
He wanted one,

32:19.564 --> 32:21.816
an Inhuman, someone
for his men to go after.

32:21.899 --> 32:23.776
We brought him Daisy.

32:26.779 --> 32:27.989
What?

32:31.826 --> 32:34.621
It was all talk for so long.

32:35.079 --> 32:39.375
"Get a powered person and kill it."

32:39.834 --> 32:41.377
But then you all were there,

32:41.461 --> 32:45.131
and we got to see a real, live freak
fire a shock wave.

32:45.840 --> 32:51.471
Only thing is, we didn't think
it was a tiny, unassuming little girl.

32:52.180 --> 32:53.556
If we did,

32:53.848 --> 32:55.725
we'd have gone after you instead.

32:56.225 --> 32:57.810
What do you mean, "instead"?

33:11.074 --> 33:12.450
Why didn't you just tell me?

33:12.533 --> 33:14.702
- It's complicated.
- It's always complicated with you.

33:14.786 --> 33:16.162
Ruben, I wanted to
keep you away from all this.

33:16.245 --> 33:17.664
That's true of the Watchdogs, too.

33:17.747 --> 33:19.123
You're angry and aimless,
and I didn't want them...

33:19.207 --> 33:20.958
Better than being blindsided!

33:25.672 --> 33:27.215
You don't believe that.

33:27.298 --> 33:28.925
What do you know about me?

33:29.008 --> 33:30.426
You've been so busy protecting freaks,

33:30.510 --> 33:31.886
- you haven't even...
- Not just them!

33:31.969 --> 33:33.388
People!

33:33.471 --> 33:35.264
Damn it, that's why
I joined S.H.I.E.L.D.,

33:35.390 --> 33:38.810
to protect the people I care about,
to protect you.

33:40.728 --> 33:42.271
What was that?

33:50.029 --> 33:51.114
All right!

33:53.157 --> 33:55.243
Let's kill this freak!

33:58.079 --> 33:59.497
They torched our bikes.

33:59.580 --> 34:00.998
We can't get away.

34:01.082 --> 34:02.875
Looks like the Watchdogs followed us.

34:02.959 --> 34:04.419
I guess now
we're the ones being hunted.

34:04.502 --> 34:06.129
- But we're not...
- Inhumans?

34:06.212 --> 34:07.338
It doesn't matter.

34:07.797 --> 34:09.632
Your new heroes will still kill us.

34:09.716 --> 34:10.757
Can't we just make a break for it?

34:10.842 --> 34:12.467
No, that's not a good idea.

34:12.552 --> 34:15.304
It's too wide open out front.
They'll pick us off before we get too far.

34:15.429 --> 34:16.639
So what do we do?

34:16.764 --> 34:18.641
I'm thinking.

34:18.766 --> 34:20.726
- Wait.
- Search all the rooms.

34:20.810 --> 34:21.978
Check upstairs.

34:22.103 --> 34:24.063
Can't be more than five.

34:24.147 --> 34:25.313
They got to be here somewhere.

34:25.398 --> 34:27.275
And they're spread out.

34:27.358 --> 34:28.818
Okay, um...

34:28.900 --> 34:31.362
Did Dad take his shotgun with him
to the Florida condo?

34:31.446 --> 34:32.780
No, it's still there.

34:32.864 --> 34:35.742
He doesn't have any slugs,
just bird shot.

34:36.117 --> 34:37.618
That'll work.

34:38.995 --> 34:40.413
All right. Back of the house is woods,

34:40.496 --> 34:41.706
so that's the new goal.

34:41.789 --> 34:43.498
We get to the backdoor in the kitchen.

34:43.583 --> 34:45.333
Then we slip out into the woods
and escape.

34:46.878 --> 34:48.963
So, this is what you do at S.H.I.E.L.D.?

34:49.464 --> 34:51.882
Hmm? This kind of stuff?

34:51.966 --> 34:54.594
Ruben, I'm a mechanic.

34:55.469 --> 34:57.388
I hate this stuff.

35:06.022 --> 35:07.648
You made it dark.

35:07.732 --> 35:09.066
I have.

35:09.150 --> 35:11.027
Won't that make it hard
for us to see them coming?

35:11.110 --> 35:12.278
Yeah.

35:12.361 --> 35:14.572
But it also means
they won't be able to see us.

35:14.655 --> 35:16.866
And we know our way around
this house with our eyes closed.

35:19.327 --> 35:20.369
Ah!

35:21.454 --> 35:24.415
The rest'll be coming now, so stay alert.

35:32.715 --> 35:34.342
You ever use one of these before?

35:34.425 --> 35:35.468
An assault rifle?

35:35.551 --> 35:36.969
- Yeah.
- No.

35:37.094 --> 35:38.846
Obviously, you have.
Talk me through it.

35:40.431 --> 35:42.433
If it moves, shoot it.

35:42.517 --> 35:44.936
And try not to shoot yourself. Or me.

35:45.978 --> 35:48.606
I'll clear the entryway. You follow.

36:08.334 --> 36:09.460
We got to go.

36:11.462 --> 36:13.840
Hey, hey! Hey, stay...
Stay away from the door.

36:14.549 --> 36:16.342
How many shooters
did you see upstairs?

36:16.425 --> 36:18.511
- Just the one.
- Are you sure?

36:18.594 --> 36:20.888
And we only found three Watchdogs.

36:22.557 --> 36:23.808
Where are the other two?

36:35.111 --> 36:36.487
So that's it.

36:36.612 --> 36:37.947
We can go out the...

36:38.656 --> 36:39.699
Shh!

36:48.332 --> 36:50.918
They must've figured out
this was our escape route.

36:51.002 --> 36:52.128
They're waiting for us.

36:52.211 --> 36:53.254
Did they see us?

36:53.337 --> 36:54.380
No.

36:54.463 --> 36:56.465
If they did, they would've
been in here by now.

36:56.549 --> 36:58.843
They're gonna be a problem
if we want to get out of here.

36:59.135 --> 37:01.178
Look, we need...

37:04.682 --> 37:06.350
No!

37:19.488 --> 37:21.574
That lock won't hold.

37:24.327 --> 37:25.995
What the hell are you doing?

37:27.663 --> 37:29.248
Shotgun axe.

37:49.352 --> 37:50.728
You beat them.

37:51.020 --> 37:52.521
You did that.

37:54.690 --> 37:56.943
This is why I didn't tell you.

38:09.205 --> 38:10.831
He'll be okay?

38:10.915 --> 38:12.792
Yeah, yeah. He'll be fine.

38:13.125 --> 38:16.128
They're taking him to a facility nearby.
It's one of ours.

38:16.212 --> 38:17.797
I'll drive you.

38:22.218 --> 38:23.302
You all right?

38:23.386 --> 38:24.887
I've never...

38:25.930 --> 38:29.642
All those men here,
he had to shoot them to...

38:30.059 --> 38:32.269
I know, I know. It's a lot to take in.

38:32.395 --> 38:34.063
But you're safe now.

38:34.146 --> 38:36.732
S.H.I.E.L.D. will take all
the wounded men into custody,

38:36.816 --> 38:38.442
and Damage Control will clean up.

38:38.567 --> 38:39.986
S.H.I.E.L.D.

38:41.737 --> 38:43.072
Alfie works for S.H.I.E.L.D.

38:43.155 --> 38:44.657
He's one of the best...

38:44.740 --> 38:47.076
Did you just call him "Alfie"? Wow.

38:47.618 --> 38:48.744
Thank you.

38:48.828 --> 38:51.372
I cannot wait for him
to get back from recovery now.

38:51.455 --> 38:52.790
What do you call him?

38:52.915 --> 38:54.083
Mack.

38:54.959 --> 38:56.585
That's what my buddies call me.

38:58.129 --> 38:59.755
He said his friends took off?

39:00.256 --> 39:01.757
Yeah. Yeah.

39:02.591 --> 39:04.093
But not all of them.

39:04.176 --> 39:06.303
And now that you know about us,
we might give you a ring.

39:06.429 --> 39:07.805
Your brother says
you're a good wheel man.

39:08.139 --> 39:09.598
And you're his partner.

39:11.809 --> 39:14.854
Yeah. I should've been here for him.

39:15.271 --> 39:17.356
I could've stopped them.

39:17.690 --> 39:19.483
He seemed
to handle things fine.

39:19.984 --> 39:21.652
He's good at it?

39:22.945 --> 39:24.030
Saving people?

39:24.447 --> 39:26.699
When I need someone
to watch my back,

39:26.782 --> 39:28.451
he's the person I want.

39:29.618 --> 39:30.786
Okay.

39:32.788 --> 39:33.956
Good.

39:35.666 --> 39:38.294
You still want that ride, Mini Mack?

39:47.678 --> 39:50.347
You were right.
The ATCU attack was a cover.

39:50.473 --> 39:51.849
Found surveillance video.

39:52.558 --> 39:55.102
This is about an hour
before the implosion.

39:55.186 --> 39:56.604
We ran the plates.

39:56.687 --> 39:58.105
Company car.

39:58.189 --> 39:59.398
Malick?

39:59.482 --> 40:00.649
You win.

40:01.901 --> 40:03.611
This wasn't an act of terrorism.

40:03.694 --> 40:05.905
- It was a distraction and a cover-up.
- Sponsored by HYDRA.

40:05.988 --> 40:08.824
Malick's firing up the Watchdogs,
feeding them intel.

40:08.908 --> 40:11.452
If they got that kind of funding,
they're not going anywhere.

40:11.535 --> 40:13.037
And Malick?

40:13.162 --> 40:15.873
God only knows
what he took from there.

40:34.266 --> 40:35.935
I kept my part of the deal.

40:36.060 --> 40:38.437
Now I expect you to keep yours.

40:42.358 --> 40:44.026
I want weaponry.

40:44.568 --> 40:47.154
And not that Stark Industries
reissue crap.

40:47.238 --> 40:49.615
I'm talking about the big guns.

40:49.865 --> 40:52.118
So we can finally
hunt down these freaks.

40:52.409 --> 40:53.536
Yes.

40:54.453 --> 40:55.704
Freaks.

40:57.373 --> 41:01.085
If everything goes as planned,
we'll all get what we want, Mr Blake.

41:01.710 --> 41:03.796
Our common enemies will be dead,

41:03.879 --> 41:08.384
and you'll have troops,
armed to the teeth, at your command.

41:08.467 --> 41:09.635
Yeah.

41:10.219 --> 41:11.387
Sounds right.
