WEBVTT

00:05.873 --> 00:07.841
United States versus China
in the World Cup Final?!

00:07.875 --> 00:10.311
I'm going to forget
all about this in 24 hours,

00:10.344 --> 00:12.213
but right now,
this is my world.

00:12.246 --> 00:13.881
We're team USA,
right, Tina Pham?

00:13.914 --> 00:15.649
Sure she was born in China,

00:15.683 --> 00:17.718
but this is the only home
she's known.

00:17.751 --> 00:19.187
It would be dope
if the U.S. won.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.021
You know, finally stick it
to another country for once.

00:21.055 --> 00:23.391
Hey,
don't discount China.

00:23.424 --> 00:25.326
The way that pitcher
used her head

00:25.359 --> 00:27.195
to bounce the ball
over the cage?

00:27.228 --> 00:28.762
Resourceful
and unexpected.

00:28.796 --> 00:29.930
That's China.

00:29.963 --> 00:31.399
Did you say "pitcher"?

00:31.432 --> 00:32.433
I really don't care
who wins this game.

00:32.466 --> 00:33.667
Marvin:
You call this a game?

00:33.701 --> 00:35.203
Where's the hitting?

00:35.236 --> 00:37.238
Where's all the blood,
little Liza?

00:37.271 --> 00:39.840
That's why I voted
to watch "Cops."

00:39.873 --> 00:41.209
Can you guys keep it down?

00:41.242 --> 00:43.544
All this commotion is
distracting Maria from eating.

00:45.746 --> 00:47.181
Cool.

00:47.215 --> 00:49.283
Just add yams to the list
of things you won't eat,

00:49.317 --> 00:52.586
which so far is everything
but strawberries and crayons.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.555
Honey, pipe down,
we can't hear the game.

00:54.588 --> 00:55.756
If this is a game,

00:55.789 --> 00:57.258
then "The English Patient"
is a war movie.

00:57.291 --> 00:58.859
It's been 90 minutes
and no one has scored!

00:58.892 --> 01:01.629
Oh, come on,
let the gals use their hands!

01:01.662 --> 01:03.364
Relax, Marvin.
We're in overtime.

01:03.397 --> 01:04.932
This'll be over
any second.

01:04.965 --> 01:06.434
Announcer: And we're going
to penalty kicks.

01:06.467 --> 01:08.536
If Brandi Chastain
makes this penalty kick,

01:08.569 --> 01:10.070
the U.S. wins.

01:10.104 --> 01:11.639
Chastain places the ball.

01:11.672 --> 01:14.208
It all comes down
to this kick.

01:23.584 --> 01:24.785
Goal!

01:24.818 --> 01:27.721
USA wins!

01:27.755 --> 01:31.259
And Chastain falls to her knees
in celebration!

01:31.292 --> 01:33.761
What a picture-perfect
moment.

01:33.794 --> 01:39.467
* Ooh, baby

01:41.869 --> 01:44.138
Rushing off
to do his homework.

01:44.172 --> 01:47.675
He may root for team USA,
but his blood runs red.

01:47.708 --> 01:49.943

01:49.977 --> 01:51.412
* Fresh off the boat

01:51.445 --> 01:53.013
* I'm gettin' mine
everywhere I go *

01:53.046 --> 01:55.149
* If you don't know, homey,
now you know *

01:55.183 --> 01:56.484
* Fresh off the boat

01:56.517 --> 01:58.919
* Homey, you don't know
where I come from *

01:58.952 --> 02:00.254
* But I know where I'm goin'

02:00.288 --> 02:03.090
* I'm fresh off the boat

02:05.293 --> 02:07.127
Hmm, proofreading
your dad's poetry again?

02:07.161 --> 02:08.362
If only.

02:08.396 --> 02:10.631
I'm trying to pick an elective
for 9th grade.

02:10.664 --> 02:12.500
There's just so many
great options --

02:12.533 --> 02:14.034
Photography, Yearbook,
Drama...

02:14.067 --> 02:15.936
Ugh. Drama?

02:15.969 --> 02:18.206
Woodshop? Ceramics?
Welding?

02:18.239 --> 02:20.040
Are you starting high school
or prison?

02:20.073 --> 02:21.575
Let me help you
narrow it down.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.180
Thanks!

02:27.548 --> 02:29.683
Good morning!

02:29.717 --> 02:31.151
I was wondering
if you have any tips

02:31.185 --> 02:33.521
for getting pureed carrots
out of linen?

02:33.554 --> 02:35.523
Maybe finish chewing
before you talk?

02:35.556 --> 02:37.191
They're from Maria.

02:37.225 --> 02:38.326
When it comes to food,

02:38.359 --> 02:39.960
she's more of a thrower
than an eater.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.662
Mm,
like a soccer pitcher.

02:41.695 --> 02:44.365
Eddie, you were supposed to
be up 30 minutes ago.

02:44.398 --> 02:45.733
Did you sleep through
your alarm again?

02:45.766 --> 02:47.000
Oh, I threw that garbage
in the river.

02:47.034 --> 02:48.035
It's so loud.

02:48.068 --> 02:49.470
Anyways, I'm starving.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.038
Where those
breakfast dogs at?

02:52.540 --> 02:54.742
I wish Maria
would eat like Eddie.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.244
Mealtime
is always a battle.

02:56.277 --> 02:58.312
I mean, especially now that
I have two kids to wrangle.

02:58.346 --> 02:59.313
I wouldn't know.

02:59.347 --> 03:01.549
Because I have three.

03:01.582 --> 03:03.384
Why don't you trick her
with a treat?

03:03.417 --> 03:04.985
Tempt Maria
with something she likes,

03:05.018 --> 03:07.087
like strawberries,
and then while she's chewing,

03:07.120 --> 03:08.922
shove in
a spoonful of beef.

03:08.956 --> 03:10.558
Hmm...
I don't know...

03:10.591 --> 03:11.692
Trust me, it works.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.594
I do it all the time
with Eddie,

03:13.627 --> 03:14.595
except in reverse.

03:14.628 --> 03:15.463
Watch this.

03:17.531 --> 03:18.699
Thanks, Ma.

03:18.732 --> 03:20.334
See?
Now he eats fruit.

03:20.368 --> 03:22.903
Guess who made
the front page of the paper?

03:22.936 --> 03:24.037
Our girl Brandi!

03:24.071 --> 03:25.939
* Ooh --

03:25.973 --> 03:26.974
Nope!

03:29.142 --> 03:30.344
What's up with Evan?

03:30.378 --> 03:32.112
He just ran off
without checking the DOW.

03:32.145 --> 03:33.447
Eddie: Ohh, I know.

03:33.481 --> 03:35.583
Brandi Chastain
in a sports bra?

03:35.616 --> 03:38.519
The way he acted
at last night's game?

03:38.552 --> 03:40.554
Evan's got his first case
of "the tingles".

03:40.588 --> 03:42.556
"The tingles"?

03:42.590 --> 03:45.793
You know, Little Evan
is finally talking to Big Evan.

03:45.826 --> 03:47.194
Ohh.
Ohh.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.562
Ohh.

03:48.596 --> 03:50.097
Yeah...

03:50.130 --> 03:51.599
I -- I have gotta --

03:51.632 --> 03:52.433
I have --

03:52.466 --> 03:53.934
Okay...

03:55.269 --> 03:56.370
Well, it's sooner
than we thought,

03:56.404 --> 03:58.238
but I guess it's time
to give Evan

03:58.272 --> 04:00.207
my patented talk,
"The Talk".

04:00.240 --> 04:01.275
Good. Have fun.

04:01.309 --> 04:03.110
Everything waist-down
is your territory.

04:03.143 --> 04:05.045
I made that very clear
in our vows.

04:07.948 --> 04:10.751
Hey. Do you still have that
"Flowers and Watering Cans" book

04:10.784 --> 04:11.952
lying around somewhere?

04:11.985 --> 04:13.321
You mean
the "Birds and the Bees" book

04:13.354 --> 04:14.655
that Principal Hunter
gave me?

04:14.688 --> 04:16.290
Yeah, it's for Evan's
"tingle talk".

04:16.324 --> 04:18.292
I'm going to pretend like
I'm going to read from it,

04:18.326 --> 04:20.294
then discard it
in dramatic fashion.

04:20.328 --> 04:21.795
You know,
open with a "wow".

04:21.829 --> 04:23.464
Wait.

04:23.497 --> 04:26.400
You're going to give him
the exact same talk you gave me?

04:26.434 --> 04:28.035
Do you remember
that talk?

04:29.002 --> 04:31.171
Half the reason
I came to this country

04:31.204 --> 04:32.906
is so you could have
lots of sex.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.742
Stay away from Arkansas,

04:34.775 --> 04:36.344
they outlawed
all the fun stuff...

04:36.377 --> 04:38.412
If you pretend like
you have a bad back,

04:38.446 --> 04:40.948
you don't have to do
so much work.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.916
You can't give Evan
that talk.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.318
Why?
It was a great talk.

04:44.352 --> 04:46.019
Oh, it was the best talk.
You killed it.

04:46.053 --> 04:48.589
But Evan's
not chill like me.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.190
He's an innocent
little dove.

04:50.223 --> 04:52.526
If you come at him like that,
his head might explode.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.695
Hmm.
Okay, point taken.

04:54.728 --> 04:56.263
I'll make
some adjustments.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.465
You know, Evan it up.

04:57.498 --> 04:58.499
I don't know.

04:58.532 --> 04:59.800
You're going to make it
weird for him.

04:59.833 --> 05:00.801
Maybe I should do it.

05:00.834 --> 05:02.703
Evan looks up to me.

05:02.736 --> 05:04.372
I'm kinda like
his father figure.

05:04.405 --> 05:05.373
What?

05:05.406 --> 05:06.640
No.
I'm his father figure.

05:06.674 --> 05:07.941
You're barely
a son figure.

05:07.975 --> 05:08.809
Oh, God,
I didn't mean that.

05:08.842 --> 05:10.277
You're a great son.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.312
It's just -- it's my job,
stay out of it.

05:13.381 --> 05:14.948
Really.
You're great.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.384
Solid son.

05:19.052 --> 05:20.388
Notice anything?

05:20.421 --> 05:21.555
Yes. Everything.

05:21.589 --> 05:22.723
What?

05:22.756 --> 05:23.991
No stains!

05:24.024 --> 05:25.493
I tricked Maria
using a treat,

05:25.526 --> 05:27.361
and I got her to eat
a few bites of chicken.

05:27.395 --> 05:29.062
Your advice was great!

05:29.096 --> 05:30.063
Well, water is wet.

05:30.097 --> 05:30.898
I am beautiful.

05:30.931 --> 05:32.299
Are we just playing a game

05:32.332 --> 05:34.368
in which we say things
we already know?

05:34.402 --> 05:35.636
Well, thank you.

05:35.669 --> 05:36.737
I owe you one.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.375
Is that your
mother-in-law?

05:41.409 --> 05:42.142
What did she say?

05:42.175 --> 05:43.243
Who knows.

05:43.276 --> 05:45.479
She always yells
across the house at me

05:45.513 --> 05:47.715
and then gets annoyed
when I can't understand her,

05:47.748 --> 05:48.849
and yells again.

05:48.882 --> 05:51.351
It makes it so hard
to ignore her twice.

05:54.287 --> 05:55.389
Two more yells

05:55.423 --> 05:58.091
until the stray dogs
start barking back.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.660
Still better
than my father-in-law,

05:59.693 --> 06:01.361
the gesticulator.

06:01.395 --> 06:03.564
He's like one of those,
like, inflatable tube men

06:03.597 --> 06:05.399
at the car wash.

06:05.433 --> 06:07.200
Except a tube man
wouldn't punch through

06:07.234 --> 06:09.369
the last self-portrait
your Nana ever painted.

06:09.403 --> 06:11.939
Should I take Yearbook
or Drama or German?

06:12.906 --> 06:15.275
"Ask again later"?!

06:15.308 --> 06:17.845
Uh...is Emery okay?

06:17.878 --> 06:19.847
He's still trying
to choose an elective.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.515
I hope
he figures it out soon

06:21.549 --> 06:23.617
because I can't study
with all these interruptions.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.525
Man: Hot dog!

06:31.559 --> 06:34.194
Now your favorite food
is your favorite toy!

06:34.227 --> 06:35.463
Eddie:
Where you going, nerd?!

06:35.496 --> 06:38.231
Sorry, it just rolls off
the tongue at this point.

06:38.265 --> 06:40.601
These are my props
for "The Talk".

06:40.634 --> 06:41.869
I thought about
what you said

06:41.902 --> 06:43.571
and realized that Evan's
more of a visual learner.

06:44.271 --> 06:45.238
Is that a --

06:45.272 --> 06:46.907
A conch shell
I painted hair on?

06:46.940 --> 06:47.908
You bet your ass it is.

06:47.941 --> 06:50.043
Okay,
I really think all this

06:50.077 --> 06:51.144
is just gonna
confuse Evan.

06:51.178 --> 06:52.245
Come on, Eddie.

06:52.279 --> 06:54.782
I thought you were
supposed to be chill.

06:54.815 --> 06:55.816
Relax, I got this.

06:59.487 --> 07:01.288
Evan?

07:01.321 --> 07:02.723
Yes, Papa?

07:05.926 --> 07:07.961
Aww...

07:11.364 --> 07:13.567
Oh. Nothing.

07:18.772 --> 07:19.607
I couldn't do it.

07:19.640 --> 07:20.808
I don't know what happened!

07:20.841 --> 07:21.909
I choked!

07:23.010 --> 07:23.977
Don't worry, Pops.

07:25.713 --> 07:27.114
Eddie's got this.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.352
Yo, Evan. Listen up.

07:32.385 --> 07:33.787
Yes, Brother?

07:48.068 --> 07:49.703
Has he always been
this adorable?

07:49.737 --> 07:52.172
He had one bad Saturday
a couple years ago.

07:52.205 --> 07:53.941
Other than that, yup.

07:58.378 --> 08:00.013
Afternoon, Mother!

08:00.047 --> 08:01.549
Well, you're
in a better mood today.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.183
That I am!

08:03.216 --> 08:04.552
Why are you shouting?

08:04.585 --> 08:06.353
I'm "projecting".

08:06.386 --> 08:08.556
It's a technique actors use
to be heard across the room.

08:08.589 --> 08:09.857
I'm not following.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.124
I talked to Honey,

08:11.158 --> 08:13.794
and she helped me pick
an elective -- Drama!

08:13.827 --> 08:16.363
She did what?!!

08:16.396 --> 08:17.798
Now you're projecting!

08:17.831 --> 08:19.199
Did you take Drama, too?

08:24.504 --> 08:25.806
You!

08:25.839 --> 08:27.007
What did you say
to him?!

08:27.040 --> 08:28.408
Wh--

08:28.441 --> 08:30.210
Emery said that
after he talked to you,

08:30.243 --> 08:32.312
he signed up for Drama!

08:32.345 --> 08:34.414
Oh, good! I'm glad
he finally picked something.
No.

08:34.447 --> 08:36.183
Drama is
a garbage elective.

08:36.216 --> 08:38.251
I -- I thought
you just wanted him to choose?

08:38.285 --> 08:41.388
Well, I didn't think he would
choose something so useless.

08:41.421 --> 08:44.324
That's right up there
with Spanish or CPR Training.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.226
Jessica, I know how you feel
about the arts,

08:46.259 --> 08:47.828
but there are aspects of Drama

08:47.861 --> 08:49.029
I think really
could help Emery --

08:49.062 --> 08:51.264
What exactly
did you say to him?

08:51.298 --> 08:52.900
That it would be "fun"?

08:52.933 --> 08:54.935
Help him utilize
his "imagination"?

08:54.968 --> 08:58.205
Get in touch
with his "feelings"?

08:58.238 --> 08:59.773
Why are you using
air quotes?

08:59.807 --> 09:00.941
Those are real words.

09:00.974 --> 09:03.443
Are they, "Honey"?

09:03.476 --> 09:07.047
Look, Emery was stressed
about his electives,

09:07.080 --> 09:10.350
and it was obviously
stressing you out, too.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.185
And you had been
so helpful with Maria,

09:12.219 --> 09:13.520
I just wanted
to repay the favor.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.055
Well, if you want
to do me a favor,

09:15.088 --> 09:16.523
just stay in your lane.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.225
Really?

09:18.258 --> 09:20.060
Because you never
stay in your lane.

09:20.093 --> 09:22.696
Name one time
I haven't.

09:22.730 --> 09:24.932
How about the time you threw out
all of my Shania CDs

09:24.965 --> 09:27.067
because you said country-pop
wasn't a real thing?

09:27.100 --> 09:29.903
Or the time you tried
to have my first name changed?

09:29.937 --> 09:31.605
Or the time
you casually suggested

09:31.639 --> 09:33.573
I would be happier
with a younger man?

09:33.607 --> 09:35.075
Casually?

09:35.108 --> 09:37.110
I gave you Eddie's
basketball coach's number.

09:37.144 --> 09:38.445
Look,
as misguided as that was,

09:38.478 --> 09:40.147
I knew you were just
looking out for me.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.949
That's what good friends do.

09:41.982 --> 09:43.483
You see a chance to help
and you do it.

09:43.516 --> 09:44.885
You don't ask
for permission.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.787
Oh, so we don't have
to ask for permission

09:46.820 --> 09:47.655
to help each other?

09:47.688 --> 09:49.322
Good,
because there have been

09:49.356 --> 09:50.423
so many times
I wanted to help you,

09:50.457 --> 09:51.725
but I held back.

09:51.759 --> 09:53.661
This has been
you holding back?

09:53.694 --> 09:55.428
Well, I can't help you
with everything, Honey.

09:55.462 --> 09:56.764
Oh.

09:56.797 --> 09:58.632
Okay.

09:58.666 --> 09:59.933
Okay, well,
if you think I need help,

09:59.967 --> 10:00.901
then by all means,
don't hold back.

10:00.934 --> 10:01.902
You shouldn't.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.004
Neither should you.

10:04.037 --> 10:06.106
No more lanes.
Mm.

10:06.139 --> 10:07.407
Because we're
such good friends.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.441
The best.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.478
Mm.

10:11.511 --> 10:15.448
This headband
is wrong for you...friend.

10:15.482 --> 10:17.918
It draws attention
to your weird hairline.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.320
Thank you...friend.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.089
And now let me help you.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.257
This necklace is ugly,

10:24.291 --> 10:27.127
and it highlights
your oversized clavicles.

10:33.533 --> 10:34.534
You were right.

10:34.567 --> 10:35.936
Evan is
an innocent little dove.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.437
I can't see him as anything

10:37.470 --> 10:39.506
but the little boy
who plays with Beanie Babies.

10:39.539 --> 10:42.175
And where did that cute
puppy night-light come from?

10:42.209 --> 10:43.677
Innocent Boys 'R' Us?

10:43.711 --> 10:46.613
Billion-dollar idea
but try to stay focused.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.716
"The Talk" is going to be harder
than I thought.

10:48.749 --> 10:51.384
I don't think
I can go back in by myself.

10:51.418 --> 10:52.720
Maybe we could team up.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.788
Two heads are always
better than one.

10:54.822 --> 10:56.724
K-Ci is nothing
without JoJo.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.325
No idea who they are,

10:58.358 --> 11:00.728
but based on context,
yes, good plan.

11:00.761 --> 11:02.329
We flank Evan from both sides,

11:02.362 --> 11:04.865
and we turn the last Huang boy
into a Huang man.

11:04.898 --> 11:07.067
So weird, but okay.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.172
Evan, we need to talk to you
about something.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.240
Oh no.

11:13.273 --> 11:14.708
There's a hole
in the foot of my jammies.

11:14.742 --> 11:17.010
Hello, Ernie The Toe!

11:19.679 --> 11:22.349
We can't talk to him
on an empty stomach.
Hmm.

11:22.382 --> 11:24.584
What are we?
People who don't need to eat?
Thank you.

11:24.617 --> 11:27.187
We just need to get
the exact words down on paper.

11:27.220 --> 11:28.555
After that,
we talk to Evan.

11:28.588 --> 11:30.523
Yeah. We're not scared!

11:32.592 --> 11:34.394
But...

11:34.427 --> 11:36.396
maybe we should
clear our heads first

11:36.429 --> 11:38.098
with an 8:20 showing of
"The Sixth Sense."

11:38.131 --> 11:39.399
Yes, smart.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.334
We follow that up with
"Notting Hill" at 10:15,

11:41.368 --> 11:42.402
then we buckle down.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.843
Okay...

11:49.877 --> 11:53.246
Okay, little Liza,
your bottle is almost ready...

11:53.280 --> 11:55.715
Gosh, Honey,
juggling two kids looks hard.

11:55.749 --> 11:57.517
As your friend,
I thought

11:57.550 --> 11:59.386
keeping one occupied
with a fun toy might help...

12:02.622 --> 12:04.424
...to stimulate
her mind.

12:04.457 --> 12:06.426
Since she's not
walking yet.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.868
Oh, good, you're up.

12:14.902 --> 12:17.037
Since you're having a hard time
with Eddie oversleeping,

12:17.070 --> 12:18.071
as a friend,

12:18.105 --> 12:19.807
I thought
I'd lend a helping hand

12:19.840 --> 12:21.775
in the form of
a military wake up.

12:21.809 --> 12:23.076
Anybody in the mood
for some "Hello Dolly"?

12:29.416 --> 12:30.650
Ow!

12:30.683 --> 12:33.086
hurt
like a

12:33.120 --> 12:34.922
I know.
Your house, it's a mess.

12:34.955 --> 12:37.324
You've been so preoccupied
with the kids

12:37.357 --> 12:38.458
that you've let
everything slide.

12:38.491 --> 12:41.061
That's why I thought
I would help

12:41.094 --> 12:43.096
by inviting your in-laws
to stay.

12:43.130 --> 12:47.234
Can't hurt to have an extra set
of gesticulating hands.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.402
What? You --

12:49.436 --> 12:51.604
You invited
Mervin and Candy?

12:51.638 --> 12:52.973
Yes.

12:53.006 --> 12:54.307
I love what you've done
with the place.

12:54.341 --> 12:55.809
It's so open and --

12:57.010 --> 12:58.445
It fell.

12:58.478 --> 13:01.614
Ohh. Honey,
that is not childproof.

13:01.648 --> 13:02.850
Thanks, Candy.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.586
My hairline is gorgeous.

13:09.189 --> 13:10.657
Where's Dad's pomade?

13:10.690 --> 13:12.359
I'm playing Danny Zuko
in "Grease"!

13:12.392 --> 13:14.527
It's electrifying!

13:17.164 --> 13:18.531
Grandma:
We have the house surrounded!

13:18.565 --> 13:19.933
Come out with your hands up!

13:23.136 --> 13:24.537
I got your mother-in-law
a megaphone.

13:24.571 --> 13:26.439
Now you don't have to worry
about Jenny yelling

13:26.473 --> 13:27.774
and not understanding her.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.376
Grandma:
Did you like my joke?

13:29.409 --> 13:30.777
It was me.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.545
I was the police.

13:34.047 --> 13:35.382
In conclusion,

13:35.415 --> 13:37.885
there are religious, social,
and cultural reasons

13:37.918 --> 13:39.286
for the procedure,

13:39.319 --> 13:41.154
but as far as how
it affects sensitivity,

13:41.188 --> 13:43.456
the jury's still out
on that one.

13:43.490 --> 13:46.326
Okay, so, getting to first base
means kissing.

13:46.359 --> 13:47.660
Second base --

13:47.694 --> 13:49.062
You don't want to know
what second base was like

13:49.096 --> 13:50.697
in the Navy.

13:50.730 --> 13:53.967
Ours was based on naval bases,
not baseball bases.

13:54.001 --> 13:56.136
You know,
I almost got to Pearl Harbor

13:56.169 --> 13:57.404
with the Captain's daughter.

13:59.106 --> 14:03.210
I sorta get the conch shell,
but why the tongs?

14:03.243 --> 14:05.078
Oh, I was just returning those
to the restaurant.

14:05.112 --> 14:06.746
You know, guys,
the problem with your talk

14:06.779 --> 14:08.181
is there's too much talk.

14:08.215 --> 14:10.183
You're gonna lose Evan.

14:10.217 --> 14:12.719
Now, when my old man did it,
he just used hand gestures.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.057
Boom.
Facts of life.

14:18.391 --> 14:21.028
Why do you and your dad
look like brothers?

14:21.061 --> 14:23.196
Oh, well, that's the way
it works in the Ellis family.

14:23.230 --> 14:24.731
You know,
by the time we're 25,

14:24.764 --> 14:26.666
we look like
we're old men,

14:26.699 --> 14:28.868
and then we just coast
the next 70 years.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.904
It's the curse
that keeps on blessing.

14:30.938 --> 14:32.839
I've had crow's feet
since I was in college.

14:36.143 --> 14:38.211
I'm just thankful
my sisters gave me the talk

14:38.245 --> 14:40.213
because I'm not following
any of this.

14:40.247 --> 14:42.282
Trent,
you beautiful red beast!

14:42.315 --> 14:43.683
That's brilliant!

14:43.716 --> 14:46.353
Maybe what we need
is a woman's perspective.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.788
And that's how
you pleasure a woman.

14:48.821 --> 14:50.590
Emotionally and sexually.

14:51.824 --> 14:55.062
I don't feel comfortable
saying any of that to Evan.

14:55.095 --> 14:56.930
I should have taken
notes.

14:56.964 --> 14:58.598
I'm just trying
to erase the visuals.

14:58.631 --> 15:00.600
And the sound effects
were totally unnecessary.

15:02.169 --> 15:03.736
We're worse off
than when we started.

15:03.770 --> 15:05.305
Maybe we have to rethink
the talk altogether.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.907
Yeah, and why are
we rushing into things?

15:07.941 --> 15:09.742
Evan's still young.
So young.

15:09.776 --> 15:10.944
Just a lamb, really.

15:10.978 --> 15:11.979
Yeah,
we've got plenty of time.

15:12.012 --> 15:13.446
Grandma, do you mind

15:13.480 --> 15:15.082
if I store
my Beanie Babies in here?

15:15.115 --> 15:17.417
I'm reaching an age
where I need some privacy.

15:17.450 --> 15:18.451
You do it!
No, you do it!

15:18.485 --> 15:19.319
I'll do it!

15:19.352 --> 15:19.987
No!No!

15:20.954 --> 15:23.290
Evan, your dad and Eddie

15:23.323 --> 15:25.125
need to have
a little talk with you.

15:25.158 --> 15:27.460
Not here, though.

15:27.494 --> 15:30.463
This is already too much
family time for today.

15:32.599 --> 15:36.069
And they say you can't reuse
your maternity clothes.

15:36.103 --> 15:38.405
I'm Sandy from "Grease."

15:38.438 --> 15:40.974
I came over to help
Emery run lines.

15:41.008 --> 15:43.310
Why do you look like
a low-rent "Pretty Woman"?

15:43.343 --> 15:46.613
Oh, I just bought
a few dozen turtlenecks

15:46.646 --> 15:49.016
to help you
with your clavicle problem.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.320
What do you think
of my costume?

15:53.353 --> 15:55.622
I just need help sewing
the Rydell "R" on my sweater.

15:55.655 --> 15:57.157
I'll help you.
No, I'll help you.

16:04.998 --> 16:06.366
My Danny Zuko
letterman sweater!

16:07.900 --> 16:09.136
Thanks, Honey.

16:09.169 --> 16:10.303
You wanted some drama
in his life,

16:10.337 --> 16:11.371
now you have it!

16:12.572 --> 16:15.942
Hello! I have a megaphone!

16:20.747 --> 16:21.914
Look at what you did!
Me?
Look at what you did!

16:23.516 --> 16:26.019
I came over here to help.
As a friend.

16:26.053 --> 16:27.787
Well, maybe we're the type
of friends who work best

16:27.820 --> 16:29.356
when we don't help each other
with anything!

16:29.389 --> 16:30.390
That is not
what friends do.

16:30.423 --> 16:31.791
Well, then maybe
we're not friends!

16:31.824 --> 16:33.160
Maybe we're not!

16:34.394 --> 16:36.563
Here.

16:36.596 --> 16:38.698
I'd lend you my sewing machine
to fix Emery's sweater,

16:38.731 --> 16:40.800
but, sadly, that's a thing
only friends do.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.202
That's fine.

16:42.235 --> 16:44.137
I already have
two sewing machines of my own.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.645
So, um...

16:52.679 --> 16:53.646
that's it...

16:53.680 --> 16:55.648
That's how it all works.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.551
Do you...
have any questions?

16:58.585 --> 16:59.552
Not really,

16:59.586 --> 17:01.088
I actually know
all of that already.

17:01.121 --> 17:02.555
You do?

17:02.589 --> 17:04.657
Then why'd you let Dad
take out the shell?

17:04.691 --> 17:07.227
I was confused of what
was going on inside of me,

17:07.260 --> 17:09.696
so I went to the library
and microfiched like a fool.

17:09.729 --> 17:10.997
Oh.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.566
Okay, good, but, um,
if you ever need to talk,

17:13.600 --> 17:14.601
you could always
come to me.

17:14.634 --> 17:15.602
Or me.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.704
Or...both of us.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.572
And if you guys
ever need to talk,

17:19.606 --> 17:21.408
I'm here, too.

17:21.441 --> 17:23.276
At the library,
I learned Dad's at the age

17:23.310 --> 17:25.178
where his man parts
start failing

17:25.212 --> 17:26.746
and Eddie's a year away
from his sexual peak.

17:26.779 --> 17:28.515
* Yeah

17:28.548 --> 17:30.517
Apparently,
it's all downhill from there.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.252
* No

17:32.285 --> 17:34.053
Okay, off you go.

17:44.431 --> 17:46.133
Hola, mi amor.

17:47.267 --> 17:48.368
Why?

17:48.401 --> 17:50.870
Do I and my perfectly functional
man parts

17:50.903 --> 17:53.573
need an excuse to spend
some alone time with my wife?

17:53.606 --> 17:56.376
Can we table whatever it is
you're going through right now?

17:56.409 --> 17:58.311
Honey is trying to turn Emery
into a homeless.

17:58.345 --> 18:00.713
By encouraging him
to take Drama?

18:00.747 --> 18:02.282
That's how it starts.

18:02.315 --> 18:04.951
She says she's helping me
as a friend,

18:04.984 --> 18:07.654
but all she's doing
is overstepping.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.722
Do you know how it feels
to be around somebody so pushy?

18:09.756 --> 18:11.591
Mm...

18:11.624 --> 18:14.794
I just don't see how Honey
thinks that she can help me.

18:14.827 --> 18:17.464
Well, maybe you're just
underestimating her.

18:17.497 --> 18:19.799
You're used to your relationship
being one way

18:19.832 --> 18:21.301
and now it's changing.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.903
It's like that time
I gave Evan "The Talk".

18:23.936 --> 18:26.072
You mean just now?
Yes.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.607
Did he already
know everything?
Yes.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.909
Did he teach you stuff,
too?
Yes.

18:31.378 --> 18:34.113
You know, I always figured
that being his father

18:34.147 --> 18:36.149
automatically made me
the teacher.

18:36.183 --> 18:39.586
But I'm realizing
that he'll teach me things, too,

18:39.619 --> 18:41.354
because he's going through
big life changes.

18:41.388 --> 18:42.589
And so is Honey.

18:42.622 --> 18:43.623
It only makes sense

18:43.656 --> 18:46.326
that your relationship
would evolve.

18:46.359 --> 18:48.795
So, back to my man parts,

18:48.828 --> 18:50.930
which I said
are fully functional.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.965
And have
a can-do attitude.

18:55.202 --> 18:56.002
Great, Louis.

18:56.035 --> 18:57.237
See you in the bedroom.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.647
Honey, I need
your sewing machine.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.656
Hey, let me help you.

19:16.689 --> 19:17.990
It's okay.

19:18.024 --> 19:19.726
Please.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.728
Here.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.029
You know, I have to say,

19:23.062 --> 19:24.497
the blocks
you brought over

19:24.531 --> 19:26.866
did keep Maria distracted
while I fed Liza.

19:26.899 --> 19:30.169
And Marvin's bugle worked.

19:30.203 --> 19:32.205
Eddie's so afraid
of hearing it again,

19:32.239 --> 19:34.674
now he gets up
even earlier.

19:34.707 --> 19:36.409
Well, what about
Jenny's megaphone?

19:36.443 --> 19:37.510
I threw that garbage
in the river.

19:40.747 --> 19:44.217
Honey, this may come
as a surprise to you,

19:44.251 --> 19:47.220
but I'm not very good
at accepting help.

19:47.254 --> 19:49.188
Mostly because
I never need it.

19:49.222 --> 19:50.390
Never?

19:51.591 --> 19:53.826
I'm just so used to being able
to give you advice

19:53.860 --> 19:55.194
and you just taking it.

19:55.228 --> 19:57.063
But now that you have
two kids of your own --

19:57.096 --> 19:59.766
which is still
one less than three --

19:59.799 --> 20:02.869
I guess you'll have advice
to give me, too, sometimes.

20:02.902 --> 20:05.738
So...
can we be friends again?

20:07.039 --> 20:08.741
Yes.

20:08.775 --> 20:11.578
Just know that 98% of the time,
I won't need any help.

20:11.611 --> 20:12.579
Oh.

20:12.612 --> 20:14.180
Well, I'll be there
for that 2%.

20:15.382 --> 20:18.017
Okay.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.118
Good as new.

20:19.151 --> 20:20.853
Thank you, Honey.

20:20.887 --> 20:24.056
Emery's been a lot happier
since he started Drama-ing.

20:24.090 --> 20:26.693
You know who else took
high school drama?

20:26.726 --> 20:28.227
Bill Clinton.

20:28.261 --> 20:29.796
No.
Yeah.

20:29.829 --> 20:30.797
And Richard Nixon.

20:32.265 --> 20:34.434
Well, if it's good enough
for Tricky Dick,

20:34.467 --> 20:35.568
it's good enough
for Emery.

20:41.974 --> 20:42.509
I owe you guys an apology.

20:44.176 --> 20:46.913
I shut you out because I was
avoiding having a conversation

20:46.946 --> 20:49.582
I wasn't mature enough
to have yet.

20:49.616 --> 20:51.884
But if I'm really
going to be a man,

20:51.918 --> 20:53.720
I'm gonna have
to start acting like one.

20:53.753 --> 20:56.489
So, let's talk.

20:56.523 --> 21:00.427
When a Beanie Baby
reaches a certain age...

21:02.495 --> 21:04.897
Oh, god, have you guys
always been this cute?

21:04.931 --> 21:06.265
I can't do this.

21:06.299 --> 21:07.600
Grandma, you're up.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.705
Evan, you're gonna
want to take a walk.

21:16.876 --> 21:17.744
I'm sorry, Brandi.

21:18.811 --> 21:21.681
All right, first base...
