HELLO. WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT SWITCHING TO DECAF.

01:59.353 --> 02:01.186
YOU AND BETH BROKE UP.

02:01.188 --> 02:03.255
I HAVE A 20-YEAR-OLD
BOTTLE OF SCOTCH

02:03.257 --> 02:04.656
WE COULD HAVE DROWNED
YOUR SORROWS IN.

02:04.658 --> 02:06.125
            IT WASN'T LIKE THAT.
            SHE GOT AN OFFER

02:06.127 --> 02:07.493
        TO RUN A MAJOR GALLERY
        IN HONG KONG,

02:07.495 --> 02:10.461
        SHE ASKED MY ADVICE,
        I TOLD HER
        SHE SHOULD ACCEPT.

02:10.464 --> 02:13.765
SO YOU ENCOURAGED HER
TO SPREAD HER WINGS AND FLY.

02:13.767 --> 02:18.170
            MY EXACT WORDS WERE
            I DIDN'T WANT HER
            TO HAVE ANY REGRETS.

02:18.172 --> 02:20.239
THERE WAS THAT TIME
YOU TOOK JACK

02:20.241 --> 02:22.774
ON THAT IMPROMPTU
WEEKEND TO ORLANDO.

02:22.776 --> 02:24.143
WAS THAT TO TELL HIM
ABOUT BETH?

02:24.145 --> 02:27.779
        IT WAS AN EFFORT
        TO DISTRACT HIM, YEAH.

02:27.781 --> 02:29.348
YOU'RE AN EXCELLENT
DAD, AARON.

02:29.350 --> 02:31.650
DON'T YOU EVER DOUBT THAT
FOR A SECOND.

02:31.652 --> 02:35.187
SO WHAT'S YOUR SOCIAL LIFE
BEEN LIKE IN THE MEANTIME?

02:35.189 --> 02:37.823
        NO, I DON'T REALLY HAVE
        TIME TO MEET ANYONE.

02:37.825 --> 02:39.224
        WE'RE KIND OF BUSY HERE.

02:39.226 --> 02:41.593
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
ONLINE DATING?

02:41.595 --> 02:42.828
                REALLY?

02:42.830 --> 02:44.897
    BAD IDEA.

02:44.899 --> 02:46.331
LOOK, THERE'S, UM,

02:46.333 --> 02:48.467
THIS LITTLE JAZZ CLUB
IN DUPONT CIRCLE

02:48.469 --> 02:50.702
I PLANNED ON GOING TO
SATURDAY NIGHT.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.337
                NO, NO, NO.
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.

02:52.339 --> 02:54.673
THIS ISN'T JUST
ABOUT YOU, AARON.

02:54.675 --> 02:57.176
I'M, SHALL WE SAY,
INTRIGUED

02:57.178 --> 02:59.745
BY THE IN-HOUSE
JAZZ SINGER THERE,

02:59.747 --> 03:03.815
AND YOU WILL BE
MY WINGMAN.

03:03.817 --> 03:06.451
                CAN'T WAIT.

03:06.819 --> 03:09.188
    OK, CRIME FIGHTERS,
    WE HAVE A TRIPLE HOMICIDE

03:09.190 --> 03:10.822
    IN SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH.
    A COUPLE,

03:10.824 --> 03:13.258
    RON AND KAREN MYERSON
    WERE FOUND SHOT TO DEATH

03:13.260 --> 03:14.393
    IN THEIR HOME 4 HOURS AGO.

03:14.395 --> 03:16.862
    SEVERAL HOURS BEFORE THAT,
    A SECURITY GUARD

03:16.864 --> 03:19.831
WAS FOUND STABBED TO DEATH
AT A SMALL OFFICE BUILDING.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.900
    AND LET ME GUESS--
    THE GUN USED
    TO SHOOT THE COUPLE

03:21.902 --> 03:25.270
GET YOUR MUG OUT
'CAUSE COFFEE
IS FOR CLOSERS.

03:25.272 --> 03:27.372
        NO SIGN OF A BREAK-IN
        OR FORCED ENTRY.

03:27.374 --> 03:28.874
            MAYBE THE COUPLE
            KNEW THE UNSUB.

03:28.876 --> 03:33.845
    BUT IT WOULDN'T HAVE
    TAKEN HIM HOURS
    TO GET TO THEIR HOUSE.

03:33.847 --> 03:35.214
        WHAT WAS HE DOING
        IN THE MEANTIME?

03:35.216 --> 03:36.615
    WATCHING THE COUPLE,
    CONDUCTING SURVEILLANCE,

03:36.617 --> 03:39.351
    OR HE ENCOUNTERED THEM
    EARLIER AND WAS
    TORTURING THEM.

03:39.353 --> 03:41.620
        BUT THE M.E.
        AND THE POLICE BOTH SAY
        THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE

03:41.622 --> 03:45.424
ONE THING IS CLEAR.
BOTH CRIME SCENES
LOOK CHAOTIC.

03:45.426 --> 03:46.992
THIS UNSUB IS DISORGANIZED.

03:46.994 --> 03:49.895
    THE CHAOS COULD MEAN
    THAT THIS UNSUB
    IS EITHER PSYCHOTIC

03:49.897 --> 03:52.264
    OR UNDER SOME TIME PRESSURE.
    AND IMPROVISING.

03:52.266 --> 03:54.600
        HE MAY FEEL KILLING'S
        HIS ONLY OPTION.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.301
            WE MAY BE LOOKING
            AT A SPREE.

03:56.303 --> 03:57.369
WHEELS UP IN 30.

04:05.478 --> 04:07.879
            HEY, HURRY UP!

04:13.319 --> 04:15.387
YOU CAN PUT THAT AWAY.

04:15.389 --> 04:16.788
I TOLD YOU I'D HELP YOU.

04:16.790 --> 04:19.291
        COME ON, LET'S GO.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.427
            LISTEN.

04:22.429 --> 04:25.764
        YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN.

04:25.766 --> 04:29.334
        YOU DID NOT HAVE
        TO KILL THAT COUPLE
        OR THAT SECURITY GUARD.

04:29.336 --> 04:31.370
            YOU WERE LEAVING
            A TRAIL OF BODIES

04:31.372 --> 04:34.573
            BECAUSE YOU CAN'T
            KEEP IT TOGETHER.

04:35.441 --> 04:36.942
    SHUT UP.

04:36.944 --> 04:39.311
    GET IN.

04:44.951 --> 04:49.488
        LOOK, YOU MIGHT AS WELL
        JUST DRAW A ROAD MAP
        FOR THE COPS.

04:51.391 --> 04:54.760
HAVE YOU EVER
LOOKED DEATH IN THE EYE?

04:55.428 --> 04:56.695
'CAUSE I HAVE.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.664
AND I'VE SEEN
THE GRIM REAPER

04:58.666 --> 05:01.833
STARING RIGHT BACK AT ME.

05:06.472 --> 05:09.941
    WE SHOULD WAIT TILL
    IT'S DARK BEFORE WE LEAVE.

05:09.943 --> 05:11.610
        AND IF YOU DON'T WANT
        ANOTHER BODY,

05:11.612 --> 05:15.480
        WE NEED FOOD AND WATER
        FOR REBECCA.

05:17.000 --> 05:23.074

05:59.058 --> 06:01.393
    Reid: "REMOVE MY SIN
    AND I WILL BE CLEAN.

06:01.395 --> 06:04.930
    WASH ME AND I WILL BE
    WHITER THAN SNOW."

06:04.932 --> 06:06.865
        PSALM 51.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.000
ASSUMING THE KILLS
ARE PERSONAL,

06:09.002 --> 06:11.002
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT
RON AND KAREN MYERSON.

06:11.004 --> 06:13.939
            BOTH IN THEIR 40s.
            RON WAS THE MANAGER
            OF A SPORTS BAR,

06:13.941 --> 06:18.477
THEY HAD SOME FINANCIAL
PROBLEMS. MAXED OUT
4 CREDIT CARDS.

06:18.479 --> 06:20.078
        RON TOOK OUT
        A PAYDAY LOAN LAST WEEK.

06:20.080 --> 06:24.683
    RON'S BEEN TO RENO 4 TIMES
    IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS.

06:24.685 --> 06:29.955
        BUT WOULD A PROFESSIONAL
        KILLER MURDER A SECURITY
        GUARD FOR A WEAPON?

06:29.957 --> 06:32.791
WELL, BASED ON
THE DISORGANIZATION
OF THE KILLS,

06:32.793 --> 06:34.426
I FOR ONE
WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED

06:34.428 --> 06:36.728
IF THIS WAS
A CRIME OF PASSION.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.034
    YES, SIR.
                AGENT HOTCHNER?

06:43.036 --> 06:45.036
            HI, HOW ARE YOU?
    THIS IS AGENT JAREAU.

06:45.038 --> 06:48.974
        SINCE YOU SAID A SPREE
        KILLER MAY BE AT WORK.

06:48.976 --> 06:50.542
    ANY ACTIVITY
    SINCE THE KILLINGS?

06:50.544 --> 06:51.977
        NO, BUT WE JUST SPOKE TO
        A FRIEND OF THE COUPLE

06:51.979 --> 06:54.079
        WHO WAS AT A MARRIAGE
        COUNSELING RETREAT
        WITH THEM.

06:54.081 --> 06:56.014
            THE WIFE
            WASN'T FEELING WELL,

06:56.016 --> 06:59.818
MAYBE THEY SURPRISED THE UNSUB.
WHO REPORTED THE CRIME?

06:59.820 --> 07:01.153
        THE NEIGHBOR
        FROM ACROSS THE STREET.

07:01.155 --> 07:04.656
        ONLY THE SOUND OF A CAR
        BACKFIRING AROUND 2 A.M.

07:04.658 --> 07:07.659
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL LET THE OTHERS KNOW.

07:07.661 --> 07:09.494
                        GOOD.

07:13.533 --> 07:19.104
    Rossi: THIS NEIGHBORHOOD'S
    NOT EXACTLY
    A HIGH TRAFFIC AREA.

07:19.106 --> 07:21.540
THERE'S NO SURVEILLANCE
CAMERAS.

07:21.542 --> 07:22.774
BUT THEY HAVE
AN ARMED GUARD.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.609
WHAT KIND OF PLACE
NEEDS PRIVACY AND SECURITY?

07:24.611 --> 07:26.945
        WELL, IT'S MAINLY
        ATTORNEYS, ACCOUNTANTS,
        PSYCHOLOGISTS.

07:26.947 --> 07:33.018
        MAYBE THEY WERE WORRIED
        ABOUT UNSTABLE PATIENTS
        AND CLIENTS.

07:33.754 --> 07:38.056
            THOSE HAVE TO BE
            THE UNSUB'S BLOODY
            SHOE PRINTS.

07:38.058 --> 07:41.092
YEAH, BUT THERE'S TWO SETS.

07:42.929 --> 07:46.965
    WELL, THE GUARD DIDN'T
    MAKE IT FAR FROM HIS DESK.

07:46.967 --> 07:47.866
            [CAMERA CLICKING]

07:47.868 --> 07:51.069
IT LOOKS LIKE THAT SECOND
SET OF PRINTS STAYED
OUT THERE BY THE EDGE.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.704
            MAYBE HE WAS
            JUST A WITNESS.
            THE UNSUB

07:52.706 --> 07:55.173
            COULD HAVE BEEN
            SURPRISED BY SOMEONE
            ELSE IN THE LOBBY.

07:55.175 --> 07:56.875
MAYBE HE KIDNAPPED THE WITNESS.

07:56.877 --> 07:58.777
        BUT A POSSIBILITY IS
        IT WAS A PARTNER.

07:58.779 --> 08:03.048
    IT WOULD MAKE IT
    A HELL OF A LOT EASIER
    TO OVERTAKE AN ARMED GUARD.

08:03.050 --> 08:04.483
EVEN WITHOUT
GAMBLING PROBLEMS,

08:04.485 --> 08:06.751
I CAN SEE HOW THEY
MAXED OUT 4 CREDIT CARDS.

08:06.753 --> 08:08.987
        SOMETHING VALUABLE
        COULD HAVE BEEN STOLEN

08:08.989 --> 08:12.090
        AND THE POLICE WOULDN'T
        NECESSARILY KNOW.

08:12.092 --> 08:15.760
STATE OF THE ART.
WE SHOULD CHECK
THEIR INSURANCE LIST.

08:15.762 --> 08:16.962
            THE COUPLE WAS FOUND
            OVER HERE.

08:16.964 --> 08:18.864
            THEY WERE BOTH
            SHOT IN THE CHEST.

08:18.866 --> 08:24.169
        WHICH MEANS THE UNSUB
        WAS STANDING
        RIGHT ABOUT HERE.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.771
        HE CAME IN
        FROM THE BACKYARD.

08:30.776 --> 08:33.245
WELL, TALK ABOUT
A BAD GOPHER PROBLEM.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.145
    THESE HOLES WERE DUG
    RECENTLY. LOOK AT THE DIRT.

08:35.148 --> 08:37.082
        WHAT WERE THEY DIGGING
        FOR, BURIED TREASURE?

08:37.083 --> 08:38.917
WHY WOULD THE MYERSONS
BURY ANYTHING IN THEIR YARD,

08:38.919 --> 08:40.684
JUDGING BY THE SAFE
IN THEIR HOUSE?

08:40.687 --> 08:42.020
            SO IT HAD TO BE
            THE UNSUB.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.556
            GOT SURPRISED
            WHEN THEY
            CAME HOME EARLY.

08:44.558 --> 08:48.093
SPENT ANOTHER HOUR
TRYING TO FIND WHAT
HE WAS LOOKING FOR.

08:48.095 --> 08:51.129
            HOW DID HE KNOW
            THERE WAS SOMETHING
            BURIED BACK HERE?

08:51.131 --> 08:53.765
WE'VE BEEN SAYING THIS CRIME
FELT PERSONAL.

08:53.767 --> 08:57.602
WE SHOULD HAVE GARCIA
PULL A LIST
OF PRIOR RESIDENTS.

08:57.604 --> 09:00.805
        THE UNSUB EITHER
        HAS EITHER A PARTNER
        OR A HOSTAGE WITH HIM,

09:00.807 --> 09:02.874
            MOST LIKELY MALE
            BASED ON THE PRINTS.

09:02.876 --> 09:06.111
I DID A SEARCH
OF PREVIOUS OWNERS
OF 23 CHERRY LANE,

09:06.113 --> 09:08.780
AKA, THE MYERSON HOME,
AND BEFORE THEY LIVED THERE,

09:08.782 --> 09:11.116
IT WAS OWNED BY
PROFESSOR HAROLD MASON.

09:11.118 --> 09:14.886
BOUGHT IT FROM THE BANK
WHO REPOSSESSED IT

09:14.888 --> 09:16.121
FROM AMELIA PORTER,

09:16.123 --> 09:18.623
A NOTORIOUS KILLER
IN THE STATE.

09:18.625 --> 09:20.125
        I REMEMBER THAT NAME.

09:20.127 --> 09:22.127
        SHE WAS A 30-YEAR-OLD
        WOMAN.

09:22.129 --> 09:24.162
        SHE AND HER MUCH YOUNGER
        LOVER GOT HIGH ON DRUGS

09:24.164 --> 09:26.164
        AND RAPED AND MURDERED
        HIS SISTER.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.899
            I THINK HER NAME
            WAS MIRIAM.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.200
THE YOUNGER LOVER
WAS BENTON FARLAND,

09:29.202 --> 09:31.803
17 AT THE TIME,
CONVICTED OF MURDER
FOR THE CRIME,

09:31.805 --> 09:34.306
BUT AMELIA FLED THE SCENE.
SHE WASN'T FOUND.

09:34.308 --> 09:39.044
UH, HE SERVED 12 YEARS
AT UTAH STATE PRISON.

09:39.046 --> 09:41.279
AND HE WAS RELEASED
TWO DAYS AGO.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.948
        HE'S GOTTA BE OUR UNSUB.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.783
THANKS, GARCIA.

09:45.151 --> 09:47.285
                    HERE.

09:52.125 --> 09:57.228
    I DON'T THINK SHE WOULD HAVE
    LASTED MUCH LONGER.

10:01.268 --> 10:07.272
            I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
            HOW MUCH SHE LOOKS
            LIKE MIRIAM.

10:08.240 --> 10:09.207
    MY MOM.

10:09.209 --> 10:12.210
            I DIDN'T KILL HER,
            YOU KNOW.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.079
            I MEAN, I WAS THERE.

10:14.081 --> 10:18.049
        I SHOULD HAVE
        STOPPED AMELIA,
        BUT I DIDN'T KILL HER.

10:18.051 --> 10:19.951
YOU'RE A LIAR!

10:19.953 --> 10:23.955
            I GOT BLAMED 'CAUSE
            AMELIA RAN AWAY.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.791
            BUT I DIDN'T DO IT.

10:27.126 --> 10:29.828
                I LOVED MIRIAM.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.997
            SHE WAS
            EVERYTHING TO ME.

10:31.999 --> 10:35.700
WE DON'T REMEMBER HER
THAT MUCH.

10:35.702 --> 10:38.169
 WE WERE BOTH PRETTY YOUNG.

10:38.171 --> 10:41.906
                WELL, I'M SORRY
                ABOUT THAT.

10:41.908 --> 10:46.277
        I'M SORRY THAT YOU DON'T
        EVEN HAVE MEMORIES.

10:48.114 --> 10:51.182
    SO WHERE ARE WE GONNA HIDE?

10:51.184 --> 10:52.283
    COME ON, THINK ABOUT IT.

10:52.285 --> 10:54.319
    YOU NEED A PLACE
    WHERE YOU'RE SAFE

10:54.321 --> 10:57.722
    AND YOU CAN COME UP
    WITH A PLAN.

10:58.290 --> 11:00.825
                I DON'T KNOW.

11:00.827 --> 11:05.263
    WHO HAS A CABIN
    IN THE MOUNTAINS
    NOT FAR FROM PARK CITY.

11:05.265 --> 11:07.232
        YOUR BUDDY HAS A CABIN?

11:07.234 --> 11:09.167
HIS PARENTS DO.
IT'S LIKE A VACATION HOUSE.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.202
THEY ONLY USE IT A FEW
TIMES OUT OF THE YEAR.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.171
 THE REST OF THE TIME
 IT'S EMPTY.

11:13.173 --> 11:16.374
        WE'LL GO THERE TONIGHT.

11:23.049 --> 11:26.284
        ALL RIGHT, COPY THAT,
        ROSSI. WE'LL GO TALK
        TO BENTON'S FATHER.

11:26.286 --> 11:30.288
WAS A 29-YEAR-OLD
SINGLE MOM OF TWO YOUNG KIDS
WHEN WHEN WAS KILLED.

11:30.290 --> 11:33.258
    HOW DID BENTON
    ONLY SERVE 12 YEARS
    FOR SUCH A HEINOUS CRIME?

11:33.260 --> 11:36.194
WELL, IT WAS A COMBINATION
OF HIS AGE AND WILLINGNESS

11:36.196 --> 11:37.829
TO TESTIFY AGAINST
AMELIA PORTER.

11:37.831 --> 11:39.397
ULTIMATELY THE JURY FELT
HE WAS A SENSITIVE BOY

11:39.399 --> 11:41.800
WHO WAS UNDULY INFLUENCED
BY AN OLDER DOMINANT WOMAN.

11:41.802 --> 11:43.334
            HOW DID AMELIA
            MANAGE TO ESCAPE?

11:43.336 --> 11:45.937
SHE FLED INTO THE WILDERNESS.
HER FATHER WAS A SURVIVALIST,

11:45.939 --> 11:47.772
SO SHE LEARNED
OUTDOOR SKILLS FROM HIM.

11:47.774 --> 11:49.274
    HAS ANYONE SEEN HER
    SINCE THEN?

11:49.276 --> 11:51.076
        THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

11:51.078 --> 11:56.281
    HEY, MAMA, ANY CONFIRMED
    SIGHTINGS OF AMELIA PORTER

11:56.283 --> 11:58.717
UH...
        IN THE LAST 12 YEARS?

11:58.719 --> 12:01.252
YEAH. ONE 10 YEARS AGO.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.354
OH. AND ONE 5 YEARS AGO.

12:03.356 --> 12:05.256
BOTH IN CANADA.
ONE IN VANCOUVER,

12:05.258 --> 12:07.025
THE LATEST ONE
IN THE NORTHERN TERRITORIES.

12:07.027 --> 12:09.494
BUT WHEN AUTHORITIES GOT THERE,
SHE WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND.

12:09.496 --> 12:11.362
    THE NORTHWEST TERRITORIES
    ARE HARD TO GET TO

12:11.364 --> 12:14.332
ASSUMING BENTON HAS
A MALE PARTNER WITH HIM,

12:14.334 --> 12:17.368
DOES HE HAVE ANY OLD FRIENDS
HERE HE COULD HAVE
RECONNECTED WITH?

12:17.370 --> 12:19.437
UH-UH. WHEN HE WAS A TEEN,
HE WAS A TOTAL LONER.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.206
THAT'S PROBABLY THE REASON
WHY AMELIA PORTER

12:21.208 --> 12:27.112
        ALL RIGHT, WE NEED
        TO LOOK FOR CONNECTIONS
        HE MAY HAVE HAD IN JAIL.

12:36.255 --> 12:40.892
    HEADS UP, GUYS, I GOT
    A REAL BAD FEELING
    ABOUT THIS.

12:53.038 --> 12:55.540
        CLEAR!

12:56.976 --> 12:58.042
                    JJ: CLEAR.

12:58.044 --> 13:00.411
Morgan: GUYS, OVER HERE.

13:04.483 --> 13:07.519
    THE VICTIM IS BENTON'S
    FATHER, OREN FARLAND.

13:07.521 --> 13:09.454
YOU KNOW, THIS COULD
HAVE BEEN THE FIRST KILL,

13:09.456 --> 13:12.957
        OREN LIVED HERE
        WITH HIS GRANDCHILDREN,
        ANDY AND REBECCA.

13:12.959 --> 13:16.027
ARE THESE THE KIDS OF
THE SISTER WHO GOT MURDERED?

13:16.029 --> 13:23.968
IMAGINE YOU'RE
INCARCERATED FOR 12 YEARS
AND HAVE JUST BEEN RELEASED.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.303
WHERE DO YOU GO?

13:25.305 --> 13:29.340
    Reid: YOU HAVE $40 LEFT
    AFTER BUYING A BUS TICKET

13:29.342 --> 13:34.179
    YOU HAVE NO SKILLS
    TO HELP YOU SURVIVE
    IN THE REAL WORLD,

13:34.181 --> 13:38.483
    NO FRIENDS,
    NOWHERE TO TURN BUT FAMILY.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.555
    WHO KNOWS HOW THEY'LL FEEL
    ABOUT SEEING YOU AGAIN,

13:43.557 --> 13:47.559
    BUT, REALLY,
    WHAT CHOICE DO YOU HAVE?

13:48.494 --> 13:50.395
            LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE
            WAS ENTERTAINING.

13:50.397 --> 13:53.198
I THINK IT WAS THE KIDS.

13:58.337 --> 14:01.272
        THANKS FOR THE LEMONADE.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.107
YEAH, SURE.

14:03.109 --> 14:06.578
GRANDPA'S JUST OUT
BUYING SOME GROCERIES. SO...

14:06.580 --> 14:11.082
                YEAH, YOU SAID.

14:16.121 --> 14:21.326
    SO, IS OLD MR. LITVAK
    STILL TEACHING ENGLISH LIT?

14:21.328 --> 14:24.295
            MAN, THAT GUY
            WAS A BALL-BUSTER.

14:24.297 --> 14:29.000
            BUT I PRACTICALLY
            MEMORIZED "MACBETH"
            BECAUSE OF HIM.

14:29.902 --> 14:38.443
    "WILL ALL GREAT NEPTUNE'S
    OCEAN WASH THIS BLOOD CLEAN
    FROM MY HAND?"

14:40.145 --> 14:43.181
    [DOOR OPENS]

14:45.452 --> 14:51.556
I COULD USE A LITTLE HELP
UNLOADING THE GROCERIES.

14:53.926 --> 14:56.027
                HI, DAD.

14:57.997 --> 14:59.230
        THE KIDS SAT HERE.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.531
        OREN SAT AT THE HEAD
        OF THE TABLE,

15:00.533 --> 15:02.200
        WHICH MEANS BENTON
        SAT RIGHT THERE.

15:02.202 --> 15:04.002
BENTON WASN'T SITTING
VERY CLOSE TO OREN,

15:04.004 --> 15:06.104
WHICH MEANS HE WASN'T
EXACTLY WELCOME.

15:06.106 --> 15:09.107
PROBABLY TO APPEASE HIM,
SO HE'D GO AWAY PEACEFULLY

15:09.109 --> 15:10.208
    AND LEAVE THEM ALONE.

15:10.210 --> 15:12.243
THAT OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T HAPPEN.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.412
SO WHAT WENT WRONG?

15:20.486 --> 15:22.453
I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU

15:22.455 --> 15:25.623
FOR LETTING ME STAY
FOR DINNER.

15:26.058 --> 15:28.259
                EAT UP.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.627
                THEN GO.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.930
DAD, IF YOU'D JUST
GIVE ME A SECOND--

15:31.932 --> 15:34.198
            I DON'T HAVE
            ANY CHILDREN LEFT.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.434
IF YOU'D JUST LET ME
EXPLAIN SOMETHING.

15:36.436 --> 15:37.602
            I'M NOT INTERESTED.

15:37.604 --> 15:38.436
DR. PELMAN SAID

15:38.438 --> 15:39.938
    THAT IF WE DON'T FORGIVE,

15:39.940 --> 15:41.606
        WE'LL NEVER HEAL
        AND MOVE ON.

15:41.608 --> 15:47.512
IS THAT THE B.S.
I PAY THAT QUACK
THERAPIST TO TELL YOU?

15:47.514 --> 15:50.515
"THEN YOU WILL REMEMBER
YOUR EVIL WAYS

15:50.517 --> 15:52.984
"AND YOUR DEEDS
THAT WERE NOT GOOD.

15:52.986 --> 15:55.586
"AND YOU WILL LOATHE
YOURSELVES IN YOUR OWN SIGHT

15:55.588 --> 16:01.960
FOR YOUR INIQUITIES
AND YOUR ABOMINATIONS."

16:01.962 --> 16:07.065
    YOU SHOW UP LIKE A BAD PENNY
    TO QUOTE SCRIPTURE TO ME?

16:07.067 --> 16:14.072
AND I WOULD KILL MYSELF
RIGHT NOW IF IT WOULD
BRING MIRIAM BACK.

16:15.007 --> 16:17.241
    MAYBE IT WILL.

16:17.643 --> 16:20.578
    YOU SHOULD GIVE IT A TRY.

16:31.457 --> 16:35.360
I KNOW YOU'LL NEVER
FORGIVE ME.

16:35.362 --> 16:37.762
BUT I'M YOUR OWN
FLESH AND BLOOD.

16:37.764 --> 16:41.599
DON'T YOU HAVE ANY FEELINGS
FOR ME AT ALL?

16:49.541 --> 16:54.712
        THE FEELING I HAVE
        FOR YOU FOR YOU IS...

16:55.581 --> 16:57.615
            I'D LIKE TO GUT YOU

16:57.617 --> 16:59.617
        FOR BEING THE VILE
        BASTARD THAT YOU ARE!

16:59.619 --> 17:01.452
                Andy: GRANDPA!
                STOP!

17:01.454 --> 17:04.055
    Reid: OREN COULDN'T
    CONTAIN IS ANGER.

17:04.057 --> 17:05.522
    HE STOOD UP,
    THREATENED BENTON,

17:05.525 --> 17:08.626
    WHO THEN STABBED HIM
    WITH THE STEAK KNIFE.

17:11.163 --> 17:14.298
I THINK I KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED TO THE KIDS.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.633
                    AAH! OHH!

17:15.635 --> 17:18.669
                        OHH!

17:20.506 --> 17:21.705
 NO! NO!

17:21.708 --> 17:23.374
NO, NO, NO!
NO, LET HER GO!

17:23.376 --> 17:24.608
        YOU SAW WHAT
        HE WAS GONNA DO.

17:24.611 --> 17:26.109
    HE WAS TRYING TO KILL ME.
    I HAD NO CHOICE!

17:26.112 --> 17:28.279
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
GONNA TELL THE COPS.

17:28.281 --> 17:33.317
I JUST GOT OUT OF PRISON.
THEY'LL THROW ME BACK
IN THERE FOR LIFE!

17:33.319 --> 17:35.286
    OK. LOOK,
    WE WON'T CALL THEM.

17:35.288 --> 17:38.523
I GOT A BETTER IDEA.
YOU'RE BOTH COMING WITH ME.

17:38.525 --> 17:41.692
    BENTON PROBABLY
    TOOK THE KIDS
    AS AN INSURANCE POLICY.

17:41.694 --> 17:44.162
        HE KNEW THE POLICE
        WOULDN'T BELIEVE HIM,

17:44.164 --> 17:46.631
    [CELL PHONE RINGS]
        HEY, WHAT YOU GOT,
        BABY GIRL?

17:46.633 --> 17:48.666
I'VE CONFIRMED
IT WASN'T A RANDOM THING

17:48.668 --> 17:51.169
THAT BENTON FARLAND
SHOWED UP AT THAT OFFICE

17:51.171 --> 17:52.737
WHERE THE SECURITY GUARD
WAS KILLED,

17:52.739 --> 17:55.306
BECAUSE ANDY FARLAND
HAS A THERAPIST

17:55.308 --> 17:57.442
NAMED DR. PELMAN
WHO WORKS THERE.

17:57.444 --> 17:58.709
            HOW LONG WAS ANDY
            IN THERAPY?

17:58.711 --> 18:00.578
UH, 3 YEARS. HE WAS
HAVING TROUBLE IN SCHOOL.

18:00.580 --> 18:04.649
    THAT'S NOT A SURPRISE
    GIVEN HIS MOTHER WAS
    MURDERED BY HIS UNCLE.

18:04.651 --> 18:06.751
        GARCIA, DID ANDY
        HAVE ANY CONTACT
        WITH BENTON

18:06.753 --> 18:07.718
        WHEN HE WAS IN PRISON?

18:07.720 --> 18:09.253
UH-HUH. UNFORTUNATELY, YES.

18:09.255 --> 18:12.156
ALL OF IT THE LAST TWO YEARS.
HE VISITED HIM TWICE,

18:12.158 --> 18:15.593
        CONTACT WITH BENTON
        MAY HAVE HUMANIZED HIM.

18:15.595 --> 18:20.131
        INSTEAD OF FEARING HIM,
        ANDY MIGHT ACTUALLY
        HAVE EMPATHY FOR HIM.

18:28.307 --> 18:32.176
IF YOU BEHAVE...

18:32.178 --> 18:36.114
I PROMISE
I WON'T HURT YOU.

18:36.116 --> 18:38.149
DO YOU BELIEVE ME?

18:38.151 --> 18:41.219
DO YOU BELIEVE ME?

18:42.754 --> 18:46.424
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS LITTLE,

18:46.426 --> 18:51.162
A TEACHER TOLD ME
THAT I WAS SNAKE-BITTEN.

18:51.164 --> 18:53.564
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?

18:54.900 --> 18:58.369
I ATTRACT BAD LUCK.

18:58.371 --> 19:00.404
EVERYTHING I TOUCH

19:00.406 --> 19:03.608
TURNS TO GARBAGE.

19:06.245 --> 19:08.813
BUT IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

19:08.815 --> 19:11.149
I'M JINXED.

19:11.151 --> 19:14.185
NOTHING EVER GOES MY WAY.

19:14.187 --> 19:18.356
        YOU FOUND THE MONEY,
        THOUGH, RIGHT?

19:18.358 --> 19:21.325
        IN THE BACKYARD?

19:21.327 --> 19:22.793
YEAH.

19:22.795 --> 19:25.530
I FOUND THE MONEY.

19:25.532 --> 19:26.330
        [SIREN]

19:26.332 --> 19:30.201
            CRAP. WHAT DO I DO?

19:30.203 --> 19:32.236
PULL OVER.

19:58.263 --> 20:00.665
    LICENSE AND REGISTRATION.

20:01.233 --> 20:04.435
    YEAH. IS THERE
    A PROBLEM, OFFICER?

20:04.437 --> 20:07.805
Police radio: WE HAVE A 10-57
WITH MULTIPLE INJURIES

20:07.807 --> 20:10.675
    ALL UNITS IN THE AREA
    PLEASE REPORT.

20:10.677 --> 20:13.611
        COPY THAT.
        VICTOR 5 ON THE WAY.

20:13.613 --> 20:14.845
                10-4, VICTOR 5.

20:14.847 --> 20:18.916
        I'M LETTING YOU OFF
        WITH A WARNING,
        BUT GET IT FIXED.

20:18.918 --> 20:21.252
SURE THING.

20:27.960 --> 20:31.562
MAYBE YOU KIDS
ARE MY LUCKY CHARM.

20:31.564 --> 20:37.368
    BENTON FARLAND WENT HOME
    AND MURDERED HIS FATHER
    IN AN IMPROVISED WAY.

20:37.370 --> 20:41.672
        HE NEEDED A WEAPON,
        SO HE KILLED
        AN ARMED SECURITY GUARD.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.441
        HE THEN WENT OVER
        TO THE MYERSON HOUSE
        TO DIG UP MONEY

20:43.443 --> 20:46.944
        THAT WAS BURIED THERE.
        HE SHOT THE COUPLE
        WHEN THEY SURPRISED HIM.

20:46.946 --> 20:49.880
HE BELIEVES THAT HIS ONLY
CHOICES ARE FIGHT OR FLIGHT.

20:49.882 --> 20:52.650
    Kate: HE'S LOOKING FOR

    TO HELP HIS UNCLE,

        ANDY IS SIMPLY TRYING
        TO PROTECT HIS SISTER.

HAD SURVIVAL SKILLS,

23:49.662 --> 23:51.996
BUT SHE MUST BE SOME SORT
OF A CRIMINAL MASTERMIND

23:51.998 --> 23:54.765
TO HAVE JUST VANISHED
WITHOUT A TRACE
FOR ALL THESE YEARS.

23:54.767 --> 23:57.735
    MAYBE SHE HAS A NEW VERSION
    OF BENTON HELPING HERE.

23:57.737 --> 24:01.205
    ACCORDING TO HER COUSIN'S
    STATEMENT, SHE DATED
    SEVERAL YOUNGER MEN

24:01.207 --> 24:02.740
    BEFORE BENTON,
    ALL IN THEIR EARLY 20s.

24:02.742 --> 24:06.977
        MAKES SENSE. YOUNGER MEN
        WERE EASIER TO SEDUCE
        AND CONTROL.

BENTON HAS BEEN.

24:17.824 --> 24:20.458
        HE'S EITHER INCREDIBLY
        LUCKY OR HE WAS
        ALLOWED TO LIVE.

        IT'S TOO MANY PEOPLE
        FOR BENTON TO CONTROL.

24:31.037 --> 24:33.838
        I THINK SHE WAS A GOOD
        SAMARITAN THAT STOPPED
        TO HELP WITH THE CRASH,

24:33.840 --> 24:37.808
WE SEARCHED A 100-YARD
PERIMETER. THERE'S NO SIGN
OF REBECCA FARLAND.

24:37.810 --> 24:40.110

WHEN I WAS LITTLE

SHE'S LIVED IN THE AREA
FOR 5 YEARS.

32:49.468 --> 32:53.403
SHE'S AN ORGANIC FARMER.
I GOT NOTHING ON HER
PRIOR TO 2009.

32:53.405 --> 32:58.375
SHE'S FROM WINNIPEG, CANADA.
SHE'S LIVED THERE FOR 4 YEARS.

32:58.377 --> 33:01.078
    BUT WHEN I LOOK HER UP
    PAST 2009,
    I CAN'T FIND ANYTHING.

ALL RIGHT, DAVE,
YOU, KATE, AND REID
GO TO JANE APPLEBY'S HOUSE.

33:04.283 --> 33:07.184
THE REST OF US
WILL TAKE NATASHA BANKS.

33:07.186 --> 33:09.453
            HOW DID YOU FIND ME?

33:09.455 --> 33:12.990
        YOU WERE ALWAYS PREPARED
        FOR A DISASTER.

33:12.992 --> 33:16.126
        I NEVER FORGOT
        THE OLD SURVIVAL PLAN.

33:16.128 --> 33:18.161
    THAT WAS MY PLAN.
    YOU WERE NEVER A PART OF IT.

33:18.163 --> 33:22.432
        THEN YOU SHOULDN'T
        HAVE GOTTEN DRUNK
        AND TOLD ME ABOUT IT.

33:25.403 --> 33:27.471
                WHO'S THIS?

33:27.473 --> 33:29.306
        YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE HER?

33:29.308 --> 33:33.510
        IT'S REBECCA,
        MIRIAM'S DAUGHTER.

33:34.345 --> 33:38.548
    DOESN'T SHE LOOK
    JUST LIKE HER MOTHER?

33:40.752 --> 33:43.320
            OH, MY GOD.

33:43.322 --> 33:44.688
            YOU'RE SICK.

33:44.690 --> 33:45.756
        DID YOU KIDNAP HER?

33:45.758 --> 33:49.726
            DID I KIDNAP YOU?

33:49.728 --> 33:52.229
    NO.
