00:00.574 --> 00:02.158
Hi. My name is Bridgette Dubois,

00:03.024 --> 00:05.659
and I'm going into seventh grade
at Bates Middle School.

00:05.710 --> 00:09.580
I'm taking a media class,
and my summer homework

00:09.664 --> 00:12.866
was to create a movie
about someone I met

00:12.918 --> 00:15.920
or an experience I had
this summer.

00:16.004 --> 00:18.656
This is my video.

00:26.881 --> 00:31.335
<i>Before you meet our houseguest,</i>
<i>I want you to meet my family.</i>

00:31.403 --> 00:33.003
Go away.

00:33.071 --> 00:34.738
<i>This is my little sister,</i>
<i>Marie.</i>

00:34.806 --> 00:37.074
<i>Or at least that's her eye.</i>

00:37.142 --> 00:38.692
<i>I know you're probably</i>
<i>wondering</i>

00:38.743 --> 00:40.444
<i>what the rest of her is like,</i>

00:40.528 --> 00:43.497
<i>but it's okay--</i>
<i>you're not missing anything.</i>

00:44.783 --> 00:47.184
Bridgette, turn that camera off!

00:47.252 --> 00:48.986
<i>This is my older sister, Ariel.</i>

00:49.054 --> 00:51.155
<i>She thinks she's God</i>
<i>'cause she can drive</i>

00:51.222 --> 00:54.041
<i>and is kind of pretty</i>
<i>and got born before I did.</i>

00:54.092 --> 00:55.592
<i>But I don't care.</i>

00:55.677 --> 00:58.212
<i>She's leaving for college soon,</i>
<i>and then I'll be God...</i>

00:58.263 --> 00:59.930
<i>if you don't count Mom and Dad.</i>

01:00.015 --> 01:01.298
Put that thing away!

01:04.468 --> 01:05.769
<i>This is my dad.</i>

01:05.837 --> 01:08.472
<i>He falls asleep on the couch</i>
<i>a lot on weekends.</i>

01:08.540 --> 01:10.808
<i>My mom keeps saying</i>
<i>not to wake him up.</i>

01:10.875 --> 01:13.610
<i>It's not</i> his <i>fault</i>
<i>that he's so sleepy.</i>

01:13.695 --> 01:17.348
<i>I don't get it, but that's</i>
<i>adult stuff, and it bores me.</i>

01:18.800 --> 01:20.334
<i>And this is my mom.</i>

01:20.402 --> 01:23.787
<i>She has a really cool job at</i>
<i>the district attorney's office.</i>

01:23.872 --> 01:26.240
Look, I'm sorry.
I can't help you.

01:26.291 --> 01:29.626
And I'd really appreciate it
if you'd just leave my house.

01:29.711 --> 01:30.878
Leave your house?

01:30.945 --> 01:33.380
What kind of respect
for the dead is that?

01:33.448 --> 01:35.916
Bad enough I can't
taste nothing.

01:35.967 --> 01:38.969
Bad enough I can't change
out of this suit.

01:39.054 --> 01:40.554
Bad enough I can't do nothing

01:40.621 --> 01:43.123
about this unfortunate blemish
I got here.

01:43.174 --> 01:45.793
And now I got to deal
with your bad attitude?

01:45.860 --> 01:47.628
<i>And this</i>
<i>is our summer houseguest.</i>

01:47.696 --> 01:49.029
<i>His name is Tony.</i>

01:49.097 --> 01:51.031
<i>And, oh, yeah... he's dead.</i>

01:51.099 --> 01:53.567
<i>You see, my mom talks</i>
<i>to dead people,</i>

01:53.634 --> 01:55.736
<i>and sometimes they drop by</i>
<i>to ask her things,</i>

01:55.803 --> 01:57.771
<i>whether they're invited or not.</i>

01:57.822 --> 01:59.639
Have a little pity,
psychic lady.

01:59.691 --> 02:01.141
How would you like it?

02:01.192 --> 02:03.160
You're walking down the street
minding your own business

02:03.278 --> 02:05.162
and a bunch of goons
sneak up behind you,

02:05.246 --> 02:06.480
put a bag on
your head,

02:06.531 --> 02:08.582
throw you in the trunk
of a car, and pop-pop,

02:08.649 --> 02:10.484
next thing you know, you're
buried under an overpass,

02:10.535 --> 02:11.919
never to be heard
from again.

02:11.986 --> 02:13.754
Leave me alone.

02:13.821 --> 02:15.489
You talking to me?

02:15.540 --> 02:16.874
No!
No.

02:17.876 --> 02:19.426
I just want names.

02:19.494 --> 02:21.128
Tell me who did this to me.

02:21.179 --> 02:22.379
I know you can do it.

02:22.464 --> 02:25.049
I heard about you
from well-connected people.

02:25.133 --> 02:27.000
No. I'm sorry.
I can't help you.

02:27.052 --> 02:29.436
I just don't
help bad men.

02:29.504 --> 02:30.771
Wait a second.

02:30.838 --> 02:33.357
What makes you think
I'm a bad man?

02:33.441 --> 02:36.443
You can tell
by just looking at me?

02:36.511 --> 02:39.480
<i>Tony decided he was going</i>
<i>to wear Mom down.</i>

02:39.531 --> 02:41.231
<i>He'd stay as long as it took.</i>

02:41.316 --> 02:42.866
Classic, shmassic.

02:42.951 --> 02:44.535
This movie's ridiculous.

02:44.619 --> 02:46.537
Shh.

02:46.621 --> 02:50.791
I don't even think
Jimmy Caan is Italian.

02:50.858 --> 02:53.660
Is he still here?

02:53.711 --> 02:56.330
<i>My dad had the hardest time</i>
<i>with it.</i>

02:56.381 --> 02:59.750
<i>The rest of us</i>
<i>thought he was fun.</i>

02:59.834 --> 03:03.170
And if you roll two sixes,
what do you call that?

03:03.221 --> 03:04.555
Boxcars!

03:04.639 --> 03:07.241
Right again, sweetheart.

03:07.308 --> 03:09.393
<i>But the nights</i>
<i>were hard for him.</i>

03:09.461 --> 03:11.445
<i>Ghosts don't sleep, you know.</i>

03:11.513 --> 03:13.931
Come on. What do you say
we put on a little music,

03:14.015 --> 03:16.567
have a little fun?

03:23.108 --> 03:24.508
Anyone got the password

03:24.576 --> 03:27.611
so I can get the adult channel
on the cable?

03:32.250 --> 03:34.001
I don't think your
mother's ever

03:34.068 --> 03:36.587
going to tell me
what I need to know.

03:36.671 --> 03:40.374
She's afraid you'll find a way
to get even somehow.

03:40.425 --> 03:44.094
She doesn't want to be
a part of anyone getting hurt.

03:45.630 --> 03:48.632
I think I got to get out
of here, Bridgette.

03:48.716 --> 03:51.185
There's some place
I'm supposed to be,

03:51.252 --> 03:54.054
and I think it's time
I get there.

03:54.122 --> 03:56.473
I'm going
to miss you, Tony.

03:56.558 --> 03:58.892
I think you're
the coolest.

03:58.943 --> 04:00.444
You know what?

04:00.528 --> 04:03.197
I am the coolest.

04:03.264 --> 04:05.265
You wouldn't happen to know
where your father keeps

04:05.316 --> 04:08.001
his ATM card, would you?

04:08.069 --> 04:12.673
<i>And then, one day, we woke up,</i>
<i>and he was just gone.</i>

04:12.740 --> 04:15.942
<i>Just disappeared.</i>

04:18.129 --> 04:19.997
I still miss him.

04:20.081 --> 04:21.714
I thought that he was

04:21.781 --> 04:24.418
the most amazing human being
I'd ever met.

04:24.469 --> 04:27.304
And maybe that's why
I've decided that,

04:27.388 --> 04:29.923
instead of starting
seventh grade today,

04:29.974 --> 04:33.227
I'm going to embark
on a life of crime.

04:33.294 --> 04:35.979
Oh, which reminds me...

04:37.682 --> 04:41.018
Mom, I've got your car keys,
and I've got your wallet.

04:41.102 --> 04:42.469
And don't worry.

04:42.520 --> 04:45.072
Once I make it
over the state line, I'll call.

04:52.647 --> 04:54.698
You okay?

04:54.782 --> 04:55.782
Yeah. No.

04:55.833 --> 04:57.651
Just a weird,
stupid dream.

04:57.702 --> 05:00.854
Bridgette, first day
of middle school.

05:00.922 --> 05:02.489
Just makes me nervous.

05:02.557 --> 05:04.358
Relax. It's going
to be fine.

05:04.425 --> 05:06.293
It's school.

05:06.344 --> 05:09.996
It's not like she's going to
be hanging out with criminals.

05:16.054 --> 05:17.221
Where are you going?

05:17.305 --> 05:18.972
It's still early.

05:19.023 --> 05:22.209
I got to find my car keys
and my wallet.

06:10.557 --> 06:12.942
Look, I know the district
attorney is a very busy man.

06:13.026 --> 06:14.010
CITY WORKER: You need to
make an appointment.

06:14.108 --> 06:15.442
But you don't
understand.

06:15.509 --> 06:17.727
All right? I...
I need help with this now.

06:17.795 --> 06:19.329
I don't have time
to make an appointment.

06:19.413 --> 06:21.114
I'm sorry, but if you
don't have an appointment,

06:21.165 --> 06:22.148
I can't let
you through.

06:22.200 --> 06:23.366
Why don't you
try the police?

06:23.451 --> 06:24.584
The police won't do anything.

06:24.652 --> 06:26.453
Excuse me, sir?

06:26.504 --> 06:28.288
Hi. I-I'm sorry.

06:28.339 --> 06:29.589
I couldn't help but overhear.

06:29.657 --> 06:31.675
I... I work
for the district attorney,

06:31.759 --> 06:33.426
and maybe I can help you.

06:33.494 --> 06:34.961
<i>I don't know about this.</i>

06:35.012 --> 06:36.296
DISTORTED VOICE:
Come on, Walter.

06:36.347 --> 06:37.830
You said your tooth's
killing you, right?

06:37.882 --> 06:40.350
So do it. Come on, man.
Just yank it out of there.

06:40.434 --> 06:42.552
I'll throw in an extra 20 bucks.

06:42.637 --> 06:44.921
That's $30.

06:51.011 --> 06:53.196
Okay, I've seen enough.

06:53.281 --> 06:55.365
This is just one of many.

06:55.449 --> 06:58.017
There's got to be
a law against that.

06:58.069 --> 07:00.570
Right? I mean, he's
humiliating my father.

07:00.655 --> 07:01.738
He's getting him
to injure himself.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.039
And then, if you
can believe it,

07:03.124 --> 07:04.624
he puts these things
on the Internet

07:04.692 --> 07:05.709
for other people to see.

07:05.793 --> 07:07.127
I mean, that can't be right.

07:07.194 --> 07:08.495
That's invasion
of privacy, right?

07:08.546 --> 07:10.213
You're right,
it's terrible,

07:10.298 --> 07:12.749
but I'm not sure
it's actually a crime.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.501
I mean, your father's
an adult,

07:14.552 --> 07:16.836
and he's taking money
for what he's doing.

07:16.887 --> 07:19.256
But he's obviously impaired.

07:19.340 --> 07:20.873
Look, we're not close.

07:20.925 --> 07:22.926
I wouldn't let him live
on the street like that

07:23.010 --> 07:24.227
if I were in his life.

07:24.312 --> 07:26.096
If he would let me in his life.

07:26.163 --> 07:28.732
But I... I can't just let people
do this to him.

07:28.816 --> 07:32.185
How long has it been since
the two of you have spoken?

07:32.236 --> 07:33.987
Uh... I don't know.

07:34.054 --> 07:36.573
Ten years?

07:36.657 --> 07:38.858
He's a troubled guy.

07:38.909 --> 07:41.027
He's got his demons.

07:42.246 --> 07:43.596
Can't you
find the guy

07:43.664 --> 07:45.332
making these videos?

07:45.399 --> 07:47.033
Arrest him or something?

07:47.084 --> 07:49.052
How can he be
allowed to do that?

07:49.120 --> 07:50.537
<i>We've just enough time</i>

07:50.588 --> 07:53.673
for one more
summer media project.

07:53.741 --> 07:57.210
How about... Cameron?

08:00.014 --> 08:03.082
<i>I'm Cameron Berkley,</i>
<i>and I'm new to your school.</i>

08:03.134 --> 08:05.352
<i>I just moved</i>
<i>to Phoenix this summer.</i>

08:05.419 --> 08:08.471
<i>I wish I could tell you</i>
<i>about my old hometown,</i>

08:08.556 --> 08:12.091
<i>but the FBI won't let me.</i>

08:14.595 --> 08:17.781
<i>I guess that's just life in</i>
<i>the Witness Protection Program.</i>

08:25.072 --> 08:26.656
Your video was great.

08:26.741 --> 08:28.775
Really?
I don't know.

08:28.826 --> 08:30.410
Mrs. Hudson seemed
pretty annoyed.

08:30.461 --> 08:32.544
Said I made a mockery
of the assignment.

08:32.613 --> 08:35.114
Yeah, well, that's what
made the video great.

08:41.972 --> 08:44.341
And I can see you like movies.

08:45.726 --> 08:47.727
I love movies.

08:47.795 --> 08:49.462
Especially science fiction
and anything by Kubrick.

08:49.513 --> 08:51.598
Well, it was cool
meeting you, and...

08:51.649 --> 08:53.933
thanks for
liking my video.

08:56.237 --> 08:58.405
I don't know.

08:58.472 --> 09:00.857
I ate breakfast
a little while ago.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.192
DISTORTED VOICE:
So?

09:02.276 --> 09:04.110
There's good protein
in there, man.

09:04.161 --> 09:05.645
Come on, Walter, go for it.

09:05.696 --> 09:06.780
Okay. That's enough.

09:06.831 --> 09:08.031
I get the idea.

09:08.115 --> 09:09.165
Yeah. Nice, huh?

09:09.250 --> 09:10.617
And this one's
fairly tame.

09:10.668 --> 09:12.836
I mean, there's-- ugh--
four or five

09:12.920 --> 09:15.755
other ones in there
that...

09:15.790 --> 09:17.657
It's terrible--
it's disgusting--

09:17.708 --> 09:19.242
but it isn't illegal.

09:19.310 --> 09:23.296
As long as he keeps taking money
for it, it isn't illegal.

09:24.998 --> 09:28.852
I don't think there's really
a lot that I can do for him.

09:28.936 --> 09:30.887
Have you called
social services?

09:30.971 --> 09:33.723
He's a regular at all the...
the shelters.

09:33.808 --> 09:36.309
Beyond giving him
a warm bed for the night

09:36.360 --> 09:37.977
or trying to convince him
to dry out,

09:38.028 --> 09:39.779
there's not really a lot
they can do.

09:39.847 --> 09:41.481
Oh.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.452
You hear that?

09:48.706 --> 09:50.540
Hey, Bridge, what
are you doing up?

09:50.624 --> 09:51.858
You're supposed
to be in bed.

09:51.909 --> 09:53.126
You have school
in the morning.

09:53.193 --> 09:54.294
Oh, hi, Mom.

09:54.361 --> 09:56.696
I'm just trying to watch
this old space movie.

09:57.882 --> 09:59.582
Why? Is it an assignment
or something?

09:59.667 --> 10:01.668
No. There's this new kid
at school,

10:01.719 --> 10:04.137
and he kind of
really loves movies,

10:04.204 --> 10:06.423
and I think this
is one of his favorites.

10:07.475 --> 10:09.209
He?

10:12.546 --> 10:14.013
So, what do you think?

10:14.064 --> 10:15.815
Actually,
it's pretty boring.

10:15.883 --> 10:18.151
First, there
are these monkeys,

10:18.219 --> 10:21.538
and then we're in space.

10:21.605 --> 10:23.223
Eh. I got to be honest--

10:23.290 --> 10:25.909
I've seen a lot better movies
about monkeys in space.

10:25.976 --> 10:28.445
Yeah, well, I've actually
seen this movie before,

10:28.529 --> 10:32.365
and it's...
it's pretty amazing.

10:32.416 --> 10:34.334
It's pretty spectacular.

10:34.401 --> 10:38.070
You just... you just have
to be patient with it.

10:38.122 --> 10:39.973
You just have
to give it a chance.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.374
I don't know.

10:41.442 --> 10:45.812
I mean, I don't even know
who the bad guys are yet.

10:45.880 --> 10:47.881
Well, you want me to
sit out here with you

10:47.932 --> 10:49.415
and watch it for
a little while?

10:49.467 --> 10:51.468
Sure.

11:01.145 --> 11:02.762
DISTORTED VOICE:
Walter.

11:02.813 --> 11:03.980
Hey, Walter.

11:04.064 --> 11:06.115
You still thirsty?

11:06.200 --> 11:07.433
Come on, Walter.

11:07.485 --> 11:08.935
Let's see you drink this.

11:08.986 --> 11:12.104
I think-think I had
about all I need.

11:12.156 --> 11:15.291
Yeah, well,
you're thinking wrong.

11:15.376 --> 11:17.293
This stuff is special.

11:17.378 --> 11:19.379
This stuff is the best ever.

11:19.446 --> 11:20.947
Just one sip.

11:20.998 --> 11:22.949
Come on,
you're gonna love it.

11:28.923 --> 11:31.641
Got quite a kick,
doesn't it?

11:37.130 --> 11:39.131
Weird dream.

11:39.183 --> 11:41.300
Wow. What
time is it?

11:41.352 --> 11:43.102
Is it midnight?

11:43.153 --> 11:44.470
Yeah, it's late.

11:44.522 --> 11:45.488
Time for bed.

11:50.778 --> 11:51.945
Good night, Mom.

11:52.012 --> 11:53.663
Night, sweetie.

11:57.902 --> 11:59.002
Bridge?

11:59.086 --> 12:00.820
What are you doing in here?

12:00.871 --> 12:02.121
It's the middle
of the night.

12:02.189 --> 12:03.373
Go get in your own bed.

12:03.440 --> 12:04.624
"Bridge"?

12:04.692 --> 12:06.159
What are you talking about?

12:06.227 --> 12:08.595
It's me, Allison,
and I am in my own bed.

12:08.662 --> 12:10.630
Whoa!

12:10.681 --> 12:12.382
What do you mean,
you are Allison?

12:12.466 --> 12:14.083
What do you mean,
"what do I mean"?

12:14.151 --> 12:16.052
And why are you
looking at me like that?

12:16.136 --> 12:18.021
How's a kid supposed
to get any rest

12:18.088 --> 12:20.039
with all this
yelling out here?

12:20.107 --> 12:21.057
Oh, no.

12:21.141 --> 12:23.526
Mom, you look funny.

12:23.611 --> 12:24.527
"Mom"?

12:24.612 --> 12:25.812
Why are you calling her Mom?

12:25.879 --> 12:28.231
Okay, what is everybody
doing in the hallway?

12:28.315 --> 12:31.350
Mind your own beeswax and
crawl back into your hole.

12:31.402 --> 12:32.619
Mom.

12:32.686 --> 12:34.737
Ariel, just give us a minute
here to figure things out.

12:34.822 --> 12:36.823
Dad, what is going on here?

12:36.874 --> 12:38.791
I don't know, honey.
I just got here myself.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.043
What's going on?

12:40.127 --> 12:41.494
Are we having a family meeting?

12:41.545 --> 12:42.879
Boy, you are dumb.

12:42.963 --> 12:44.464
Mom!
Mom!
What?!

12:44.531 --> 12:46.583
Dad!
Dad!

12:46.667 --> 12:47.884
Yep, that's me.

12:47.952 --> 12:49.302
Still.

12:56.921 --> 12:58.822
What are you doing?

12:58.889 --> 13:01.825
Hey, I'm talking to you.

13:01.876 --> 13:06.162
Uh, yeah, I... I completely
get the talking part.

13:06.213 --> 13:09.415
It's the "I'm" part
that's, uh, throwing me.

13:09.500 --> 13:12.085
I need to sleep on the couch.

13:12.169 --> 13:13.720
Why?

13:13.804 --> 13:16.339
Have you looked in a mirror?

13:16.390 --> 13:19.142
You know, this is
one of those moments

13:19.209 --> 13:21.010
where I could really
use your support.

13:21.061 --> 13:23.313
You have my support.

13:23.380 --> 13:26.015
You have it in heart,
in mind, in spirit.

13:26.066 --> 13:30.019
Just... not in bed.

13:30.070 --> 13:31.437
Excuse me.

13:32.490 --> 13:34.223
Fine. You do
what you need to do.

13:34.275 --> 13:36.109
I got to make a call, anyways.

13:36.193 --> 13:37.911
Call? Br-- Allison.

13:37.995 --> 13:39.078
What-- It's 20 past 12:00.

13:39.163 --> 13:40.079
Who are you calling?

13:40.164 --> 13:42.198
Devalos.

13:42.249 --> 13:46.286
Before all this happened, I had
a dream about that man's father.

13:46.370 --> 13:48.338
The one in the videos.

13:48.405 --> 13:50.840
Someone tried to make him
drink rubbing alcohol.

13:50.908 --> 13:52.208
That could kill him, you know.

13:52.259 --> 13:54.010
Okay, okay, give me the phone.

13:54.077 --> 13:55.678
Hey!

13:55.746 --> 13:57.463
You can't make that call.
Listen to yourself.

13:57.548 --> 13:58.548
You sound like...

13:58.599 --> 14:00.583
Like my 12-year-old daughter.

♪ ♪

14:04.889 --> 14:06.756
Okay, you want me to do it?

Holy crap.

14:31.632 --> 14:33.199
What are you staring at?

14:33.267 --> 14:35.284
We're all going to look
like this someday.

14:40.808 --> 14:42.508
Ooh.

♪ ♪

14:56.774 --> 14:58.908
Can I ask a question?

I don't know.

15:00.327 --> 15:01.828
Can you ask
a question?

15:01.912 --> 15:03.613
Of course you can
ask a question.

15:03.664 --> 15:06.983
What are you guys going to do
about school and stuff?

15:07.034 --> 15:09.035
Okay, so here's
what we're going to do.

15:09.119 --> 15:12.005
I'm going to e-mail my boss,
I'm going to explain to him

15:12.089 --> 15:14.674
that I'm not feeling well
and that I can't come in today.

15:14.758 --> 15:16.659
Oh, and same thing
goes for you, too, kiddo.

15:16.710 --> 15:18.160
No school today.

15:18.212 --> 15:19.345
Yes!

15:19.430 --> 15:20.346
Excellent.

15:20.431 --> 15:22.098
Outstanding
thinking, Mom.

15:22.132 --> 15:23.549
Oh, darn.

15:23.634 --> 15:26.102
I have
my pre-algebra test today.

15:26.169 --> 15:27.520
That's okay. That's not
a problem, because I will--

15:27.605 --> 15:29.171
your mom and I will
write you a note,

15:29.223 --> 15:31.024
and you can take
a makeup test.

15:31.108 --> 15:32.191
Oh, no.

15:32.276 --> 15:34.143
I have Mean Mr. Morris
for math this year.

15:34.194 --> 15:36.529
He hates makeup tests almost
as much as he hates kids.

15:36.614 --> 15:38.731
Actually, that's true.

15:38.816 --> 15:40.283
I had him.

15:40.350 --> 15:42.368
He thinks that kids try
and cheat by skipping school

15:42.453 --> 15:44.404
and then finding out
what's on the tests.

15:44.488 --> 15:46.656
And then he makes
the makeup tests twice as hard.

15:46.707 --> 15:49.409
Yeah, well, doesn't seem like
we have a lot of options.

15:49.493 --> 15:50.877
Well, hold on a second.

15:50.961 --> 15:51.878
Allison, you know math.

15:51.962 --> 15:53.713
Don't you think
you can pass

15:53.797 --> 15:55.248
a seventh-grade math test?

15:55.332 --> 15:56.466
What are you talking about?

15:56.533 --> 15:59.252
I think I know
what he's talking about.

15:59.336 --> 16:01.921
You go to my school
and you take my test for me.

16:02.006 --> 16:03.256
No, no, no.

16:03.340 --> 16:04.590
That is not going to happen.

16:04.675 --> 16:06.059
What-- no, it's
a great idea.

16:06.143 --> 16:08.227
Listen, no one's going to
know that you're not her.

16:08.312 --> 16:10.229
You don't have to stay
the whole day at school.

16:10.314 --> 16:12.214
You just take the test,
and then you tell them

16:12.266 --> 16:14.517
that you feel sick, and you
go down to the nurse's office,

16:14.568 --> 16:15.685
and I'll come pick you up.

16:15.736 --> 16:16.853
Or I could pick you up.

16:16.904 --> 16:18.021
You can't drive.

16:18.072 --> 16:19.322
Yes, I can.

16:19.389 --> 16:22.075
I have a license with my picture
on it and everything.

16:22.159 --> 16:24.110
No. No, you won't.

16:24.194 --> 16:26.329
Because you're
staying right here.

16:26.413 --> 16:29.165
And if you touch
either one of those cars,

16:29.232 --> 16:31.701
you're going to be
grounded for life.

16:31.752 --> 16:32.785
Understand?

16:32.870 --> 16:34.070
Right.

16:34.121 --> 16:36.839
But I still get to watch TV
all day, right?

16:45.049 --> 16:47.350
Can't believe
I'm actually doing this.

16:47.417 --> 16:48.918
Ah, it's going
to be fine.

16:48.969 --> 16:51.754
Um, do you want to
go over it again?

16:51.805 --> 16:53.806
Yeah, maybe.

16:57.478 --> 16:58.644
Homeroom number?

16:58.729 --> 16:59.896
304.

16:59.947 --> 17:01.764
Teacher's name: Mr. Hanley.

17:01.815 --> 17:03.232
First period?

17:03.283 --> 17:04.233
English. Mr. Wesley.

17:04.284 --> 17:06.118
Second?
Art. Ms. Manson.

17:06.203 --> 17:07.119
Third?

17:07.204 --> 17:08.204
The main event.

17:08.271 --> 17:09.622
Math.

17:09.707 --> 17:12.942
I take the test, and then
I'm getting out of there.

17:14.627 --> 17:16.796
Yeah.

17:16.880 --> 17:18.164
I guess I'll see you later.

17:18.248 --> 17:21.784
You'll definitely
see me later.

17:21.835 --> 17:25.003
God, I hated seventh grade.

17:31.678 --> 17:32.595
Hello.

17:32.646 --> 17:34.647
Allison?

17:34.732 --> 17:36.149
Maybe. Depends.

17:36.233 --> 17:37.700
Who's asking?

17:37.768 --> 17:39.301
It's Manuel.

17:39.353 --> 17:41.888
Look, uh, I know
you're not feeling well,

17:41.955 --> 17:43.272
but I thought
you'd want to hear.

17:43.340 --> 17:44.707
After Joe called last night,

17:44.775 --> 17:46.626
I sent some officers
to that alley.

17:46.693 --> 17:49.479
They found the man
you'd dreamed about.

17:49.546 --> 17:52.698
Unfortunately, they didn't
find him soon enough.

17:52.783 --> 17:53.699
I'm afraid he's dead.

17:53.784 --> 17:57.170
Wow. You found a dead guy?

17:57.254 --> 17:58.955
Allison, you all right?

17:59.006 --> 18:00.656
Oh, yeah, sure.

18:00.707 --> 18:02.708
Other than being sick.

18:02.793 --> 18:04.844
So where's the dead guy now?

18:04.928 --> 18:06.996
Well, he's in the morgue.

18:07.047 --> 18:08.181
Really?

18:08.265 --> 18:10.883
Uh, am I allowed
to go look at him?

18:10.951 --> 18:12.718
Of course you can
go look at him,

18:12.803 --> 18:15.888
but I thought you were sick
and staying home.

18:15.973 --> 18:20.509
Well, not if you order me
to come and look at him.

18:20.561 --> 18:23.679
If you order me to come in
and look at the dead guy,

18:23.730 --> 18:26.515
then nobody could really
get mad at me, you know,

18:26.567 --> 18:28.901
leaving the house and maybe
taking a cab down there.

18:28.986 --> 18:30.119
You know?

18:30.187 --> 18:33.706
Allison, I... I'm really
concerned about you.

18:33.791 --> 18:35.524
You don't sound like
yourself at all.

18:35.576 --> 18:38.244
Does that mean
you want to see me?

18:38.328 --> 18:42.048
Are you ordering me to come down
and see you and the dead guy?

18:42.132 --> 18:43.749
Well, I don't know
how to answer that.

18:43.834 --> 18:45.585
Only you know
how you're feeling.

18:45.669 --> 18:48.504
I'm feeling like
that's an order.

18:48.555 --> 18:50.840
So, let me ask you,
how does this work?

18:50.891 --> 18:52.675
Do you have a lunch room
down there

18:52.726 --> 18:54.360
or do I have to bring something?

18:54.428 --> 18:55.478
Hmm?

19:04.655 --> 19:06.656
Nurse's office. Nurse's office.

19:09.743 --> 19:11.944
Hey, Bridgette!
Bridgette!

19:12.029 --> 19:14.197
Hey, been trying to
get your attention

19:14.248 --> 19:15.281
ever since
the bell rang.

19:15.365 --> 19:17.033
You mad at me
or something?

19:17.084 --> 19:19.368
Me? Mad? At you?

19:19.419 --> 19:21.671
Why would I be mad at you?

19:21.738 --> 19:22.672
I don't know.

19:22.739 --> 19:26.008
You just seem...
different.

19:26.076 --> 19:27.710
Anyway, I brought in
some of those movies

19:27.761 --> 19:28.845
we were talking
about yesterday.

19:28.912 --> 19:30.596
I mean, if you wanted
to borrow them.

19:30.681 --> 19:31.597
Oh.

19:31.682 --> 19:33.599
Cameron.

19:33.684 --> 19:35.468
Thanks.

19:35.552 --> 19:37.470
That's really nice.

19:37.554 --> 19:38.921
You're nice.

19:38.972 --> 19:40.273
Isn't that nice
that you're nice?

19:40.357 --> 19:42.424
I'm sorry that
I didn't pay attention

19:42.476 --> 19:43.759
to you back there.

19:43.810 --> 19:45.761
I mean, I'm just,
I'm not feeling very well.

19:45.812 --> 19:48.814
And I was actually headed
to the nurse's office.

19:48.899 --> 19:50.900
I think I'm going to
end up going home.

19:50.951 --> 19:53.035
Oh. Well, you want me
to walk you there?

19:53.103 --> 19:55.071
Do you actually know
where it is?

19:55.122 --> 19:56.405
Sure.

19:59.442 --> 20:03.579
So is it, like,
a stomach thing or a head thing

20:03.630 --> 20:05.748
or kind of
an all over thing?

20:05.799 --> 20:08.801
It's kind of an
all over thing.

20:08.886 --> 20:11.420
Well, you think
it'll be gone by Saturday?

20:11.471 --> 20:14.173
Boy, I hope so.

20:14.258 --> 20:16.792
Good. 'Cause the original
<i>Planet of the Apes</i> is playing

20:16.843 --> 20:18.261
at this old
movie theater downtown,

20:18.312 --> 20:20.396
and my dad's
gonna drop me off,

20:20.463 --> 20:23.465
and I was kind of wondering
if you wanted to go.

20:29.523 --> 20:31.140
You're not saying anything.

20:31.191 --> 20:33.409
Did you just ask me out?

20:33.476 --> 20:35.411
Like, on a date?

20:38.248 --> 20:39.165
Okay. Yeah.

20:39.249 --> 20:41.033
I... I guess.

20:43.036 --> 20:45.538
So, is it okay?

20:45.622 --> 20:47.039
Do you want to go?

20:48.125 --> 20:50.126
♪ ♪

21:16.353 --> 21:17.370
Hi.

21:17.454 --> 21:19.138
You wanted to see me, boss?

21:21.191 --> 21:22.208
Yes.

21:22.292 --> 21:23.709
You remember Mr. Durant.

21:23.794 --> 21:24.744
Yes.

21:24.828 --> 21:26.912
No.

21:26.980 --> 21:28.748
Um, you feeling
any better?

21:28.832 --> 21:32.051
Your feet giving you trouble?

21:32.135 --> 21:33.169
No, these shoes.

21:33.220 --> 21:34.553
I mean, who
thought those up?

21:34.638 --> 21:37.340
Some grown-up, probably
some boy grown-up.

21:37.391 --> 21:41.644
I was just about to bring
Mr. Durant down to the morgue.

21:41.711 --> 21:44.714
See if he's able to identify
the body of his father.

21:44.781 --> 21:46.766
You know what your dad
looks like, right?

21:46.850 --> 21:48.317
Yes.

21:48.385 --> 21:50.069
Don't worry.
He can do it.

21:50.153 --> 21:51.988
Would you like to join us?

21:52.055 --> 21:54.607
To see the dead guy?

21:54.675 --> 21:56.859
Cool.

21:58.195 --> 22:00.446
That's him.

22:00.530 --> 22:02.365
That's my father.

22:04.618 --> 22:08.170
It's the first time
I've seen him in...

22:08.238 --> 22:10.572
I don't know-- it's
got to be ten years.

22:12.209 --> 22:14.677
I just hoped he'd...

22:14.744 --> 22:17.596
pull himself together...

22:17.681 --> 22:20.749
get some help.

22:20.801 --> 22:22.918
I'm sorry. This is hard.

22:22.969 --> 22:24.053
It's okay, Mr. Durant.

22:24.104 --> 22:26.055
You take all the time
you need, sir.

22:29.759 --> 22:31.093
Hey.

22:31.144 --> 22:32.895
That's not really
him, is it?

22:32.946 --> 22:35.097
What are you
talking about?

22:35.148 --> 22:36.899
He looks so phony.

22:36.967 --> 22:38.767
You're not trying to
trick this guy, are you?

22:38.819 --> 22:39.985
Allison.

22:45.042 --> 22:46.108
Thank you, Mr. Durant.

22:46.159 --> 22:47.293
Yeah.

22:47.377 --> 22:49.578
Uh, when they called to tell
me they found my father,

22:49.629 --> 22:51.831
uh, they told me they thought
there might be a video

22:51.915 --> 22:54.116
of whatever it was that happened
to him on the Internet.

22:54.167 --> 22:55.418
It's true.

22:55.469 --> 22:57.586
We're in the process of
having it taken down.

22:57.637 --> 22:59.672
It's footage of an
unidentified man

22:59.756 --> 23:01.140
paying your father to drink

23:01.224 --> 23:04.093
from a bottle
labeled rubbing alcohol.

23:04.144 --> 23:05.644
According to
the medical examiner,

23:05.729 --> 23:07.796
the bottle was actually filled
with drain cleaner.

23:07.848 --> 23:09.682
Oh, my God.

23:09.766 --> 23:12.351
Now, because the man
behind the camera

23:12.436 --> 23:14.070
misrepresented the contents
of the bottle,

23:14.137 --> 23:16.522
we are treating this case
as a homicide.

23:16.606 --> 23:18.240
MORGUE ATTENDANT:
Excuse me.

23:18.308 --> 23:20.276
Ma'am, what
are you doing?

23:22.412 --> 23:24.580
I'm sorry.

23:24.647 --> 23:28.084
I just... he didn't look real.

23:34.958 --> 23:36.509
No key.

23:36.593 --> 23:37.760
Where have
you been?

23:37.827 --> 23:39.178
We've been worried
sick about you.

23:39.262 --> 23:41.347
You are in
so much trouble!

23:41.431 --> 23:43.432
I'm starving. What's for dinner?

23:43.500 --> 23:45.801
Hey. We are talking to you,
young lady.

23:45.852 --> 23:47.269
Your father just
got off the phone

23:47.337 --> 23:48.387
with the district attorney.

23:48.472 --> 23:50.139
You went to my office
today, didn't you?

23:50.190 --> 23:51.474
Can't believe you
ate without me.

23:51.525 --> 23:53.192
What your mother
is trying to say

23:53.276 --> 23:55.277
is that you were supposed
to stay at home today.

23:55.345 --> 23:57.563
That was the plan.
What?

23:57.647 --> 23:59.648
Mom's boss called me,

23:59.699 --> 24:02.017
and he practically ordered me
to go down there.

24:02.068 --> 24:04.069
Oh, no. In fact...

24:04.154 --> 24:05.521
he told Daddy
that you were acting

24:05.572 --> 24:07.456
like a crazy person
at the morgue today.

24:07.524 --> 24:08.991
Sit down at that table,
young lady.

24:09.042 --> 24:10.626
Daddy had to come
up with an excuse

24:10.693 --> 24:12.411
that you were
on medication.

24:12.496 --> 24:14.079
Bridgette,
how could you do that to us

24:14.164 --> 24:15.965
when we specifically
told you not to?

24:16.032 --> 24:17.533
Hey, look, I'm sorry.

24:17.584 --> 24:18.867
None of this is my fault.

24:18.919 --> 24:20.702
I didn't plan this.

24:20.804 --> 24:22.421
How would you like
to be a 12-year-old

24:22.506 --> 24:25.591
sitting at home
all by yourself all day long.

24:25.675 --> 24:28.727
And by the way,
your job is boring.

24:28.812 --> 24:29.929
Boring!

24:30.013 --> 24:31.263
I mean, besides
the dead guy

24:31.348 --> 24:34.099
and the... the snacks,
I would much prefer

24:34.184 --> 24:37.603
to be at school
taking that stupid test.

24:37.687 --> 24:40.573
So how did my test go, anyway?

24:42.659 --> 24:44.410
Went okay.

24:44.528 --> 24:46.328
Just okay?

24:46.396 --> 24:48.113
No, I... maybe they've
changed pre-algebra

24:48.198 --> 24:49.582
since I last took it.

24:49.666 --> 24:51.733
Or added some new pre-algebra.

24:51.785 --> 24:54.503
Well, either way,
I think I did all right.

24:54.571 --> 24:56.005
All right?

24:56.072 --> 24:59.575
I put goop all over my face and
you're giving me "all right"?

24:59.643 --> 25:02.127
You better not have done
anything embarrassing.

25:02.212 --> 25:03.629
Bridgette, what kind of a way

25:03.713 --> 25:06.248
is that to talk to...
to her? Huh?

25:06.299 --> 25:08.917
For your information,
I left right after third period,

25:08.969 --> 25:11.020
so I didn't get a chance
to talk to anyone.

25:11.087 --> 25:13.639
Oh, except that boy--
Cameron.

25:15.192 --> 25:17.226
You talked to Cameron?

25:17.277 --> 25:19.361
What did he say?

25:19.429 --> 25:20.479
Nothing. Nothing
that he isn't going

25:20.564 --> 25:22.198
to say to you
next time you see him.

25:22.265 --> 25:23.566
Well, what does that mean?

25:23.617 --> 25:25.267
Well, it means
that he said some things,

25:25.318 --> 25:27.603
and I made him promise
to say them again

25:27.654 --> 25:29.455
next time you see him at school

25:29.539 --> 25:31.707
so that you don't miss out
on anything.

25:31.774 --> 25:34.493
But... what if I don't want
to wait?

25:34.578 --> 25:36.462
When am I going back to school?

25:36.530 --> 25:38.780
When is this thing
going to be fixed?

25:38.882 --> 25:40.633
You know I don't know
the answer to that.

25:40.717 --> 25:42.284
Then, tell me what he said.

25:42.335 --> 25:44.553
No. I really want you
to hear it from him.

25:44.621 --> 25:45.954
Fine, then I'll call him.

25:46.006 --> 25:48.457
You can't do that.
You don't sound like you.

25:48.508 --> 25:50.259
This sucks.

25:50.310 --> 25:52.344
Then, can you call him?

25:52.429 --> 25:53.479
And what, ask him to repeat

25:53.563 --> 25:55.264
the same things
he already said to me today?

25:55.315 --> 25:56.682
Then, you should
just say them to me.

25:56.766 --> 25:59.818
Just... tell me what he said.

26:03.707 --> 26:05.407
He likes you.

26:07.327 --> 26:09.361
He said that?

26:09.446 --> 26:11.997
No. He said...

26:12.082 --> 26:13.966
that he's going to a movie
on Saturday,

26:14.034 --> 26:15.834
and he was wondering
if you could come.

26:15.919 --> 26:17.670
And what did you say?

26:17.754 --> 26:20.940
I said, "Ask me again
when I'm feeling better."

26:21.007 --> 26:23.325
What? You couldn't just say yes?

26:23.376 --> 26:24.993
Well, I knew that
was the first time

26:25.045 --> 26:26.295
anyone had ever asked you out,

26:26.346 --> 26:29.181
and I wanted you
to be the one to say yes.

26:29.266 --> 26:31.884
But I'm not there to say yes,
and I may never be.

26:31.968 --> 26:33.052
Bridge...

26:33.136 --> 26:34.836
But what if he changes his mind?

26:34.888 --> 26:36.889
And what if this thing
isn't fixed by Saturday?

26:36.973 --> 26:39.841
You know, you guys
are yelling at me.

26:39.893 --> 26:41.527
Mom spends three
hours in my shoes--

26:41.611 --> 26:44.530
she completely ruins my life,
and you guys are yelling at me.

26:48.151 --> 26:50.185
I-I don't know about this.

26:50.236 --> 26:51.520
DISTORTED VOICE:
Come on, Walter.

26:51.571 --> 26:53.205
You said your tooth's
killing you, right?

26:53.290 --> 26:55.691
So do it. Come on, man,
just yank it out of there.

26:55.742 --> 26:57.710
I'll throw in
an extra 20 bucks.

26:57.794 --> 27:00.212
That's $30.

27:10.173 --> 27:11.873
Oh, my God.

27:11.925 --> 27:13.592
That's so gnarly.

27:13.677 --> 27:16.044
Best one yet, Walter.

27:16.096 --> 27:18.046
You earned your money today.

27:22.067 --> 27:23.967
I'm telling you, it was
Bridgette's friend, Cameron,

27:24.042 --> 27:26.009
who shot all those videos
and killed that man.

27:26.094 --> 27:27.561
So, if I understand
you correctly,

27:27.629 --> 27:29.963
our daughter is in love
with a sociopath?

27:30.014 --> 27:31.331
It's not funny, Joe.

27:31.382 --> 27:32.816
What are we
going to do?

27:32.884 --> 27:34.818
How are we going
to tell her?

27:34.886 --> 27:38.722
Well, I don't think
there's anything to tell her.

27:38.790 --> 27:41.191
You've e-mailed all
the pertinent information

27:41.259 --> 27:42.626
to the district
attorney,

27:42.694 --> 27:45.245
and I think all we can do
now is just sit tight...

27:45.313 --> 27:47.514
But I don't want
to just sit tight.

27:47.565 --> 27:49.483
I mean, I think everything

27:49.551 --> 27:51.652
that's going on right now
is connected.

27:51.703 --> 27:53.153
Don't you see?

27:53.204 --> 27:54.621
I think I had
to become Bridgette

27:54.689 --> 27:57.524
so I could meet this Cameron kid
and find out who he truly is

27:57.592 --> 28:00.193
and put a stop to all this.

28:00.245 --> 28:01.612
No. You're wrong.

28:01.679 --> 28:03.380
Cameron would never do
any of the things

28:03.465 --> 28:04.865
that you said that he did.

28:04.916 --> 28:05.916
Sweetie...

28:06.000 --> 28:07.301
No. Don't "sweetie" me.

28:07.368 --> 28:08.802
All right.
Honey, come on.

28:08.870 --> 28:09.870
Come sit down.

28:09.938 --> 28:11.305
Let me tell you
what's going on.

28:11.372 --> 28:12.723
Let me tell you
what I know.

28:12.807 --> 28:15.309
No. I know what you know,
and you're wrong.

28:21.716 --> 28:23.267
Hi, Cameron.

28:25.987 --> 28:28.555
Do I know you?

28:28.606 --> 28:30.324
Uh, no, but...

28:30.391 --> 28:33.059
but you know my daughter,
Bridgette.

28:35.897 --> 28:38.398
Did you know that the police
think that you, uh,

28:38.449 --> 28:41.285
made all these awful videos
with this homeless man?

28:41.369 --> 28:43.837
They think
that you...

28:43.905 --> 28:46.239
killed him.

28:49.076 --> 28:50.878
I even know this... this person

28:50.929 --> 28:53.797
who said that they, uh,
saw you do it,

28:53.882 --> 28:56.817
but, you know, she doesn't
know you like I know you.

28:56.885 --> 28:59.269
Thing is, the police

28:59.354 --> 29:01.755
take this person's word
really seriously.

29:01.806 --> 29:05.943
So... you know,
you might want to be ready

29:06.027 --> 29:08.562
if case they come looking
for you.

29:10.114 --> 29:12.816
You might want to talk
to your parents or...

29:14.285 --> 29:16.486
You know, you could tell me
that you didn't do it.

29:16.571 --> 29:19.706
I mean, that's
a really good place to start.

29:21.543 --> 29:23.410
Oh, no.

29:27.665 --> 29:29.583
Cameron Berkley?

29:29.634 --> 29:32.085
My name's Lee Scanlon.

29:32.136 --> 29:34.087
These officers
are going to give you a ride.

29:34.138 --> 29:36.256
We're going to meet
with you and your parents,

29:36.307 --> 29:39.560
see if maybe you can answer
a few questions for us.

29:40.979 --> 29:42.262
Didn't expect to see you here.

29:42.313 --> 29:44.014
Figured you'd be down
with the flu or something.

29:44.098 --> 29:47.067
Where are they taking him?

29:47.134 --> 29:48.936
Uh, the computer guys
think they found a way

29:48.987 --> 29:50.354
to link the kid to the videos.

29:50.438 --> 29:51.805
Manny asked me to scoop him up,

29:51.856 --> 29:53.240
bring him back
to the DA's office

29:53.307 --> 29:54.641
so we could have a conversation.

29:54.692 --> 29:55.943
If you're feeling up to it,

29:55.994 --> 29:58.412
I'm sure he'd love you
to sit in.

29:59.981 --> 30:01.832
DISTORTED VOICE:
Got quite a kick, doesn't it?

30:09.190 --> 30:10.874
I apologize for making you
sit through that,

30:10.959 --> 30:13.827
Mr. and Mrs. Berkley, but I do
think that it's important

30:13.895 --> 30:15.429
that you understand
the serious nature

30:15.496 --> 30:17.514
of the crime that we believe
your son committed.

30:17.599 --> 30:18.966
CAMERON'S DAD:
You're insane.

30:19.017 --> 30:20.500
You all are.

30:20.551 --> 30:23.437
If you think our son had
anything to do with...

30:23.504 --> 30:26.506
Mr. Berkley, if I may.

30:26.557 --> 30:29.226
My client has already told you
he doesn't know that man.

30:29.343 --> 30:31.561
My client has already told you
he didn't make this video,

30:31.646 --> 30:33.614
nor any of the others
you've alluded to.

30:33.681 --> 30:35.015
So what are we
doing here?

30:35.066 --> 30:37.067
Can you see my client's face
on the other videos?

30:37.135 --> 30:39.403
Because I certainly can't
see it in this one.

30:39.487 --> 30:41.405
In every video,
the person who made it

30:41.489 --> 30:44.491
took great care
to keep himself off camera.

30:44.542 --> 30:46.977
Then, I will ask you again:
What are we doing here?

30:47.045 --> 30:49.463
Late yesterday,
our Computer Crimes Division

30:49.530 --> 30:52.215
was able to trace the IP address
of the hard drive

30:52.300 --> 30:55.218
the perpetrator used
to upload most of his videos.

30:55.303 --> 30:57.304
Turns out they came
from a public access computer

30:57.371 --> 31:01.441
at the Saguaro Branch
Public Library.

31:01.509 --> 31:03.644
I assume that that library
is familiar to you.

31:03.711 --> 31:05.762
I believe it's within
walking distance of your house.

31:05.847 --> 31:09.232
Nine of the 12
videos produced

31:09.317 --> 31:10.901
were uploaded at the library.

31:10.985 --> 31:13.654
In each instance,
the computer was signed out

31:13.721 --> 31:15.656
to one "Dave Bowman."

31:17.859 --> 31:19.343
That's the name
of the lead character

31:19.410 --> 31:21.328
in the film
<i>A Space Odyssey.</i>

31:22.697 --> 31:24.831
Your client
is quite the movie buff.

31:24.899 --> 31:29.753
I have a copy
of Mr. Bowman's signature here.

31:31.289 --> 31:34.408
I have a strong suspicion
that if our handwriting expert

31:34.475 --> 31:37.344
were to compare that to a sample
of Cameron's writing,

31:37.411 --> 31:39.429
it would be a match.

31:40.581 --> 31:42.549
What do you think, Cameron?

31:42.600 --> 31:45.268
Would you like to give us
a sample right now?

31:45.353 --> 31:46.687
Prove me wrong?

31:49.023 --> 31:50.640
I didn't kill him.

31:50.725 --> 31:53.443
I'm sorry. I need you
to speak up, Cameron.

31:53.528 --> 31:56.262
I didn't kill that man.

31:56.314 --> 31:58.365
And I didn't make that video.

31:58.433 --> 32:01.284
The county medical examiner
puts Walter Durant's death

32:01.352 --> 32:03.603
at approximately 9:15
two days ago.

32:03.671 --> 32:05.906
Can you account for
your whereabouts at that time?

32:05.957 --> 32:07.891
I was home.

32:07.959 --> 32:10.143
My parents were out.

32:10.211 --> 32:12.963
I was playing video games
until about 11:00,

32:13.047 --> 32:16.166
and then I went to bed.

32:19.453 --> 32:21.555
Yes!

32:27.261 --> 32:29.179
He didn't do it.

32:29.263 --> 32:30.897
I beg your pardon.

32:30.965 --> 32:31.965
He's telling the truth.

32:32.016 --> 32:33.316
Hey! You're innocent!

32:33.401 --> 32:35.268
Allison, what
are you doing?

32:35.319 --> 32:38.321
It's okay.
Seriously. I saw it.

32:38.406 --> 32:40.323
He was playing
video games.

32:40.408 --> 32:41.825
He's not the killer.

32:41.909 --> 32:44.945
I'm sorry, Dubois, what do you
mean when you say you "saw it."

32:44.996 --> 32:46.446
I saw it... in my head.

32:46.497 --> 32:48.832
He was doing just what
he said he was doing.

32:48.900 --> 32:49.866
Allison!

32:49.951 --> 32:54.087
I... need to speak
with you... outside.

32:59.994 --> 33:01.595
Have you lost your mind?

33:01.662 --> 33:03.547
Is that a trick question?

33:03.631 --> 33:07.500
Allison, I kid you not,
if you and I didn't have
the history that we do

33:07.552 --> 33:09.436
I would be firing you right now.

33:09.503 --> 33:10.720
I don't understand.

33:10.805 --> 33:12.689
Cameron is innocent--
that's all that really matters.

33:12.774 --> 33:14.391
I don't know why
you're all mad.

33:14.475 --> 33:17.144
Why? Because I don't happen
to think that he <i>is</i> innocent.

33:17.195 --> 33:19.863
I think you actually had it
right in the first place.

33:19.947 --> 33:21.815
Cameron Berkley
humiliated Walter Durant

33:21.866 --> 33:24.651
for his own sick amusement,
and then he murdered him.

33:24.702 --> 33:26.186
But none of that
matters anymore,

33:26.237 --> 33:28.238
because you just destroyed
any chance I have

33:28.322 --> 33:29.739
of making a case against him!

33:29.824 --> 33:31.524
Why would you <i>have</i>
to make a case?

33:31.576 --> 33:34.628
He was just playing video games,
like he said he was-- I saw it.

33:34.695 --> 33:37.297
I even saw the time
on the clock-- it was 9:04.

33:37.364 --> 33:38.381
Oh, that's great.

33:38.466 --> 33:40.300
Did you also happen
to see a calendar?

33:40.367 --> 33:42.419
Did you see anything at all
that would indicate

33:42.503 --> 33:44.304
that it was 9:04 two nights ago

33:44.371 --> 33:46.673
and not 9:04
any other night of the year?

33:46.724 --> 33:48.725
Allison...

33:48.810 --> 33:50.010
I'm at a loss.

33:50.061 --> 33:51.344
You've basically announced
to that attorney

33:51.395 --> 33:53.096
that you're the source
of the anonymous tip.

33:53.181 --> 33:55.348
Now, it's not gonna
take her long to figure out

33:55.399 --> 33:57.601
that you probably didn't
actually see any of this.

33:57.685 --> 34:00.386
And don't you think
she's gonna have a field
day with that in court?!

34:00.438 --> 34:01.404
So not only did you

34:01.489 --> 34:02.889
make a liar out of me,

34:02.940 --> 34:05.408
you told him and his attorney
that there was no real grounds

34:05.493 --> 34:07.077
for investigating him
in the first place.

34:07.161 --> 34:09.913
Forget about charging him, we'll
be lucky if they don't sue us!

34:09.996 --> 34:11.414
Well, I'm sorry.

34:11.498 --> 34:14.451
I don't think I would have
seen it if it wasn't true.

34:16.120 --> 34:19.371
Allison... just go home.

34:19.422 --> 34:21.675
I don't know what's gotten
into you these past few days,

34:21.742 --> 34:23.927
but I'd rather you just
stay at home until it's past.

34:24.011 --> 34:27.547
I can't go home;
I don't have a ride.

34:30.351 --> 34:32.802
Wait a second, I think
my ride just got here.

34:42.083 --> 34:45.253
Fresh pajamas and a change
of clothes for tomorrow,

34:45.304 --> 34:47.472
straight from
the lion's den.

34:47.556 --> 34:49.556
If you want anything else
from Bridgette's room,

34:49.625 --> 34:51.693
you're going to have
to go get it yourself.

34:51.761 --> 34:54.094
After everything
that she's done today,

34:54.146 --> 34:56.181
I can't believe that
she's mad at <i>us.</i>

34:56.264 --> 35:00.235
I wouldn't go expecting
an apology anytime soon.

35:00.302 --> 35:04.272
She's convinced her
would-be boyfriend is innocent.

35:05.474 --> 35:07.475
Maybe I should
just go tell Devalos

35:07.526 --> 35:09.194
what's really going on.

35:09.278 --> 35:11.863
How do you think he would feel
about a 12-year-old

35:11.931 --> 35:13.365
working in his office?

35:13.449 --> 35:14.699
I don't know.

35:14.784 --> 35:16.818
Do you think Bridgette's
school would be okay

35:16.869 --> 35:19.004
with a mother of three
in seventh grade?

35:20.256 --> 35:23.008
Are you expecting somebody?

35:23.092 --> 35:25.927
I'm 12-- who would
I be expecting?

35:27.713 --> 35:29.431
Uh, hi. My name's Cameron.

35:29.498 --> 35:31.182
I'm a friend of Bridgette's.

35:31.217 --> 35:33.718
I, um, know it's late, but...

35:33.803 --> 35:37.305
I was wondering if maybe
I could talk to her.

35:40.559 --> 35:42.176
She was awesome.

35:42.228 --> 35:45.030
Your mom, I mean.

35:45.114 --> 35:47.415
She really
stuck up for me.

35:47.516 --> 35:48.900
Mm-hmm.

35:51.454 --> 35:54.239
That's the real reason
I came over tonight.

35:55.691 --> 35:57.909
I had lied,
Bridgette.

35:57.977 --> 36:00.328
I lied.

36:00.379 --> 36:03.248
I did know the man
in those videos.

36:03.332 --> 36:06.167
But I don't understand.

36:06.218 --> 36:08.420
Why would you do that?

36:11.140 --> 36:14.642
He used to panhandle
in front of this theater
I liked to go to.

36:14.710 --> 36:16.928
I was coming out of
a movie one night,

36:17.013 --> 36:19.397
and he asked me if
I had any spare change.

36:19.482 --> 36:21.666
He told me if I
gave him a quarter,

36:21.734 --> 36:23.018
he'd eat it.

36:23.085 --> 36:26.521
I don't know why, but...
I thought that was funny.

36:26.572 --> 36:29.657
I asked him why he'd want
to do something like that.

36:29.725 --> 36:30.892
He just shrugged.

36:30.943 --> 36:33.728
He said it was gonna be
worth the same coming out

36:33.779 --> 36:35.747
as it was going in.

36:35.831 --> 36:38.232
So I gave him a quarter.

36:38.284 --> 36:39.617
And he did it.

36:40.669 --> 36:43.538
Then I gave him
another one...

36:43.589 --> 36:45.006
and another one...

36:46.408 --> 36:49.527
Then I whipped out my
phone and recorded it.

36:49.595 --> 36:51.629
And then you put it
on the Internet.

36:54.283 --> 36:57.352
So, then, when did you get
the idea to kill him?

36:57.419 --> 36:59.104
Cameron, don't
say another word!

36:59.188 --> 37:01.473
She's trying to trick you.

37:01.557 --> 37:03.558
She thinks that you're guilty.

37:03.609 --> 37:04.809
You think I'm guilty?

37:04.894 --> 37:07.979
Cameron came here, Mom,

37:08.064 --> 37:10.482
because he wants
to tell the truth.

37:10.566 --> 37:12.367
Don't you want
to hear the truth?

37:12.434 --> 37:15.103
I already know the truth.
No, Mrs. Dubois,
you don't.

37:16.122 --> 37:18.272
I know Walter...

37:18.324 --> 37:20.875
and I did make
most of those videos,

37:20.943 --> 37:24.412
but I didn't make that last one,
and I certainly didn't kill him.

37:24.480 --> 37:26.965
He was my
friend, okay?

37:27.032 --> 37:28.633
I know how crazy
that sounds...

37:28.717 --> 37:31.719
but it's true.

37:32.972 --> 37:35.623
I made this.

37:35.674 --> 37:38.209
It's kind of a documentary

37:38.277 --> 37:40.395
about Walter and his life.

37:40.462 --> 37:43.264
I came here
to ask Bridgette

37:43.315 --> 37:46.985
to ask you to please show this

37:47.069 --> 37:49.771
to the district attorney.

37:49.822 --> 37:53.024
I think if he looks at it,
he'll see I...

37:53.109 --> 37:55.476
I could have
never killed Walter.

37:57.079 --> 37:59.981
I guess "bum" is the word
I hate the most.

38:00.049 --> 38:01.349
A bum's a guy

38:01.417 --> 38:04.419
who never did nothin',
and that ain't me.

38:04.487 --> 38:05.870
I'm a veteran.

38:05.938 --> 38:07.872
I fought hard for this country.

38:07.957 --> 38:09.090
You coming

38:09.158 --> 38:11.492
to bed soon?
It's not like
I have to get up

38:11.544 --> 38:13.011
and go to school
in the morning.

38:13.095 --> 38:17.515
People say, "Hey, man,
this is America; get a job."

38:17.600 --> 38:19.350
You understand

38:19.435 --> 38:22.020
this doesn't
prove anything.

38:22.087 --> 38:24.172
That he could've
made this movie

38:24.223 --> 38:27.225
and still killed
Walter Durant.

38:27.293 --> 38:30.344
Yeah, and you know that he could have
erased all this, right?

38:30.396 --> 38:32.363
He could've gotten rid
of everything and anything

38:32.448 --> 38:33.915
that connected him
to this guy

38:33.983 --> 38:36.985
and never said a word
to anyone about it.

38:37.036 --> 38:39.637
But he didn't.

38:39.705 --> 38:41.623
He came to us.

38:53.035 --> 38:55.220
...but then I realized...

38:55.287 --> 38:58.239
If there's one thing I regret...

38:58.307 --> 39:02.410
I suppose it's what
I did to my family--

39:02.478 --> 39:04.979
my son, especially.

39:05.047 --> 39:09.217
I don't think he was
ever the same after I left.

39:13.155 --> 39:14.405
Oh.

39:14.490 --> 39:16.407
Oh, what time is it?

39:16.492 --> 39:19.944
It's time for bed.

39:31.373 --> 39:33.675
Hey, I'm me! You're you!
Hey, I'm me! You're you!

39:33.742 --> 39:36.594
I just, I saw my face
in the bathroom mirror!

39:36.679 --> 39:38.346
I just did the
same exact thing!

39:38.413 --> 39:39.514
We're us again!

39:39.581 --> 39:41.349
But I don't understand;
what is different?

39:41.416 --> 39:43.584
Everything!
Everything's different!

39:43.636 --> 39:46.587
I mean, I'm 12 again, and
you're... whatever you are.

39:46.639 --> 39:47.939
Honey, listen,

39:48.023 --> 39:49.440
I mean, what happened?

39:49.525 --> 39:50.942
Why did we switch back?

39:51.026 --> 39:53.945
We didn't do anything
but fall asleep, did we?

39:54.029 --> 39:57.282
Last thing I remember,
Cameron's movie was still on,

39:57.366 --> 40:00.018
and Walter was saying
something about his family.

40:03.405 --> 40:05.606
If there's one thing I regret...

40:05.658 --> 40:10.712
I suppose it's what
I did to my family--

40:10.779 --> 40:13.281
my son, especially.

40:13.332 --> 40:16.668
I don't think he was ever
the same after I left.

40:16.752 --> 40:20.255
Hey, that's the guy that
was in the morgue with me.

40:20.306 --> 40:22.540
Isn't that Walter's son?

40:22.608 --> 40:26.311
Yeah, as a matter
of fact, it is.

40:26.395 --> 40:27.428
That's weird.

40:27.479 --> 40:29.897
The other day at your work,
he was saying that

40:29.965 --> 40:31.733
he hadn't seen his
father in years.

40:31.800 --> 40:34.936
Yeah, that's the same thing
he told me when I met him.

40:39.141 --> 40:41.542
If there's one thing I regret...

40:41.610 --> 40:43.411
I suppose it's what I did

40:43.478 --> 40:45.613
to my family--

40:45.664 --> 40:47.749
my son, especially.

40:47.816 --> 40:49.083
I don't think he...

40:49.151 --> 40:51.119
Well, obviously,

40:51.170 --> 40:52.787
I misspoke.

40:52.838 --> 40:56.124
Uh, I went to visit him
a few weeks ago.

40:56.191 --> 40:57.325
We did speak.

40:57.376 --> 40:59.460
It was right after
I became aware

40:59.511 --> 41:01.162
of his stunts on the Internet.

41:01.213 --> 41:02.597
I begged him to stop.

41:02.665 --> 41:05.016
But you didn't mention
any of this to Mrs. Dubois

41:05.100 --> 41:06.684
the day you asked for her help.

41:06.769 --> 41:08.636
Well, it seemed
sort of beside the point.

41:08.687 --> 41:11.022
My dad wasn't the one
I needed legal help with.

41:11.106 --> 41:12.857
It was the monster
making these videos.

41:12.941 --> 41:14.392
Were you aware
that your father

41:14.476 --> 41:17.061
was worth a lot more dead
than he was alive?

41:17.146 --> 41:19.597
What are you talking about?
Even though the man

41:19.665 --> 41:21.382
walked away
from you and your mother,

41:21.450 --> 41:23.868
he made sure you'd both
be comfortable when he died.

41:23.952 --> 41:25.286
Life insurance,

41:25.354 --> 41:27.538
property up north,
Army death benefit.

41:27.606 --> 41:29.741
Now that you're
his only survivor,

41:29.825 --> 41:31.492
you stand to make out all right.

41:31.543 --> 41:33.411
I loved my father.

41:33.495 --> 41:37.081
That's a very ghoulish and ugly
thing to say to someone.

41:37.166 --> 41:38.249
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:38.317 --> 41:40.968
How about you let us
look at the camera?

41:41.036 --> 41:42.670
What camera?

41:42.721 --> 41:44.339
Oh, you don't have a camera?

41:44.390 --> 41:46.090
A video camera?

41:46.175 --> 41:47.809
No. I have no children.

41:47.876 --> 41:50.144
I have no need to
have a video camera.

41:50.212 --> 41:53.598
This is a copy of your most
recent credit card statement.

41:53.682 --> 41:55.483
On the day your father died,

41:55.550 --> 41:58.019
you purchased a fairly
expensive video camera,

41:58.070 --> 42:02.156
a bottle of rubbing alcohol
and a bottle of drain cleaner.

42:02.224 --> 42:04.826
Were you lying just now, or
did you simply misspeak again?

42:04.893 --> 42:08.029
N-None of this proves anything.

42:08.080 --> 42:10.748
Maybe not-- but it certainly
paints an ugly picture.

42:10.833 --> 42:13.267
You see, I think
you murdered your father,

42:13.335 --> 42:15.837
and I think you
wanted him dead for some time.

42:15.904 --> 42:18.856
So I suspect when
you saw him in these
videos on the Internet,

42:18.924 --> 42:21.509
you saw an opportunity to get
what you finally wanted.

42:23.545 --> 42:25.063
Confess to everything right now,

42:25.130 --> 42:27.565
and I'm willing to offer you
life in prison.

42:27.633 --> 42:30.051
You make me
prove it all, Mr. Durant,

42:30.119 --> 42:32.270
and you're looking
at the death penalty.

42:32.354 --> 42:33.921
The choice is yours.

42:39.561 --> 42:42.113
Hey, I thought Daddy
was supposed to be

42:42.197 --> 42:44.399
picking me up today.
You know, he
was going to,

42:44.450 --> 42:47.151
but, um, I kind of miss seeing
your face in the mirror,

42:47.236 --> 42:49.904
so I figured, you know, I'd
settle for the next best thing.

42:49.955 --> 42:52.657
Come on, what, you didn't get
your sense of humor back

42:52.741 --> 42:55.243
along with your
personality?

42:55.294 --> 42:56.711
What's this?

42:56.778 --> 42:59.280
It's the math test
you took for me.

42:59.331 --> 43:01.833
C-plus.
I <i>thought</i>
you knew math.

43:01.917 --> 43:03.968
Yeah, I thought I did, too.

43:04.052 --> 43:07.221
You know this is gonna go down
on my permanent record, right?

43:07.289 --> 43:09.056
Hey, you know, C-plus
is pretty good

43:09.124 --> 43:11.309
for someone who
didn't study.

43:11.393 --> 43:13.728
The next time
I switch places with someone,

43:13.795 --> 43:15.346
I'm totally
switching with Daddy.

43:15.431 --> 43:17.515
<i>That</i> guy knows math.
