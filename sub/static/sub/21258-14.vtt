00:00.005 --> 00:01.306
<i>Previously, on "Suits":</i>

00:01.316 --> 00:02.950
- Tell Harvey how you feel.
- What?

00:02.985 --> 00:04.471
If you don't tell him
that soon,

00:04.473 --> 00:06.247
you might lose the chance
to tell him at all.

00:06.248 --> 00:09.409
I understand why you go after
the unattainable woman.

00:09.410 --> 00:11.777
You are titillated
by what you cannot have.

00:11.812 --> 00:13.278
But I can have her, Doc.

00:13.314 --> 00:15.447
Only if you choose
to be the bad boy.

00:15.483 --> 00:16.849
What if I want to be
the bad boy?

00:16.884 --> 00:18.750
I am happy to say,
my friend,

00:18.786 --> 00:21.320
we both know that is not you.

00:21.355 --> 00:22.766
Paula said she doesn't
think we'd survive

00:22.790 --> 00:24.656
if you and I
keep working together.

00:24.792 --> 00:26.992
I want to stay here in the
position that I fought to get

00:27.027 --> 00:29.494
and that I love
and that I know I deserve.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.630
- You let Donna go.
- She left her letter

00:31.665 --> 00:33.398
of resignation on my desk.

00:33.434 --> 00:35.434
- I'm sorry, Harvey.
- You didn't make me do it.

00:35.469 --> 00:38.470
I chose to, and now
I'm choosing to undo it.

00:38.505 --> 00:41.573
- Are you okay?
- Will you come back?

00:41.609 --> 00:43.809
- Yes.
- Then I'm okay.

00:43.844 --> 00:45.722
The Dean of Admissions
is coming to check on your work

00:45.746 --> 00:47.212
tomorrow night, Miss Sazs.

00:47.247 --> 00:49.147
You mean Dean Hans
Von Schlongenhammer?

00:49.183 --> 00:50.794
You're going to get a hammer

00:50.818 --> 00:53.352
from the schlongen.
- Louis, this is my fiancé,

00:53.387 --> 00:55.220
Zander.
- Hey.

00:56.323 --> 00:58.190
<i>- What'd you see in him?</i>
<i>- I know.</i>

01:04.918 --> 01:07.619
Louis, we've been here
for 35 minutes,

01:07.654 --> 01:09.821
and you've barely said a word.

01:09.857 --> 01:11.757
What's going on?

01:11.792 --> 01:14.393
All right, you want
to know the truth?

01:14.428 --> 01:16.695
Last time I saw you,
you said I'm not the bad boy.

01:17.865 --> 01:20.432
But I thought,
"You know, why not?

01:20.467 --> 01:22.868
Why can't Louis Litt be
the bad boy just this once?"

01:22.903 --> 01:25.570
I see, so you continued
your affair with Sheila.

01:25.606 --> 01:28.240
And it was great.
I mean, I had the girl.

01:28.275 --> 01:30.342
I had the confidence.

01:30.377 --> 01:31.943
But then when I went
to meet her...

01:33.614 --> 01:35.480
He was there.
- He?

01:35.516 --> 01:37.883
The shithead that's she's
marrying, Zander Fuck Face.

01:37.918 --> 01:39.785
And how did seeing him
make you feel?

01:39.820 --> 01:41.520
How the hell do you think
it made me feel?

01:41.555 --> 01:42.866
It made me feel like someone
was ripping my heart out,

01:42.890 --> 01:44.434
shredding it to pieces,
and lighting it on fire

01:44.458 --> 01:46.258
right in front of me.

01:46.293 --> 01:47.893
- Good.
- Good?

01:47.928 --> 01:49.327
Did you not hear
what I just said?

01:49.363 --> 01:50.807
You want me to say it
again in German?

01:50.831 --> 01:53.432
I heard you, Louis.

01:53.467 --> 01:54.766
I said good

01:54.802 --> 01:56.435
because you may have
fooled yourself

01:56.470 --> 01:58.770
into believing
there was some future

01:58.806 --> 02:00.405
between you and Sheila.

02:00.441 --> 02:02.274
But coming face-to-face
with this Zander

02:02.309 --> 02:04.443
means you can now
face the truth.

02:04.478 --> 02:05.577
What truth is that?

02:05.612 --> 02:07.312
That if you do not end this,

02:07.347 --> 02:09.281
that terrible feeling
you had last night

02:09.316 --> 02:12.117
will only continue to grow.

02:12.152 --> 02:13.652
I know.

02:15.622 --> 02:17.122
You're right.

02:20.227 --> 02:22.160
It's time to let her go.

02:27.877 --> 02:30.177
- Judge Ralls?
- You remember me.

02:30.212 --> 02:31.678
Of course.

02:31.714 --> 02:33.480
You treated me fairly
during my trial.

02:33.516 --> 02:35.482
I'll never forget that.
- Good.

02:35.518 --> 02:37.784
Because I'm not just here
by accident.

02:40.089 --> 02:41.700
You're being accused
of overturning a verdict

02:41.724 --> 02:43.457
for personal gain.

02:43.492 --> 02:45.859
And if I lose, it could
cost me my judgeship.

02:45.895 --> 02:47.694
Forgive me for asking,
but why exactly

02:47.730 --> 02:48.962
are you coming
to me with this?

02:48.998 --> 02:50.964
Because you're a hell
of a lawyer.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.633
And like you said,
I always treated you

02:52.668 --> 02:55.035
fairly during your trial.
- Bullshit.

02:55.070 --> 02:57.671
How many other firms
you go to before coming to me?

02:59.608 --> 03:01.508
- Seven.
- That's what I thought.

03:01.544 --> 03:03.388
So you're not coming to me
because I know you're fair.

03:03.412 --> 03:05.879
You picked me because
anyone who takes on this case

03:05.915 --> 03:07.748
is gonna have to drop
at least one client,

03:07.783 --> 03:09.261
and you thought
you could come down here

03:09.285 --> 03:11.885
and guilt me into doing that.

03:11.921 --> 03:13.820
No, thanks.

03:14.054 --> 03:15.920
And what if that's true?

03:15.956 --> 03:19.057
I can't ask my firm
to drop a client right now.

03:19.092 --> 03:20.692
I'm sorry.

03:20.727 --> 03:21.960
You're sorry?

03:21.995 --> 03:23.428
You stood in my courtroom,

03:23.463 --> 03:26.331
said you'd been given a gift
and you wasted it.

03:26.366 --> 03:27.699
I've served for 20 years.

03:27.734 --> 03:29.412
They're accusing me
of something I didn't do,

03:29.436 --> 03:30.635
and I lose this,

03:30.670 --> 03:33.471
I lose everything
I've ever worked for.

03:33.507 --> 03:36.741
So did you mean that shit
you said to the jury or not?

03:38.000 --> 03:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:46.190 --> 03:47.723
Zander, wh-what are you
doing here?

03:47.759 --> 03:49.036
Surprised to see
someone someplace

03:49.060 --> 03:50.760
they have no business being?

03:50.795 --> 03:52.695
I know the feeling
because I felt it

03:52.730 --> 03:54.397
last night
in Sheila's office.

03:54.432 --> 03:56.866
And again, I am sorry
for interrupting.

03:56.901 --> 03:59.168
But as anyone who knows me
will tell you,

03:59.203 --> 04:01.315
I take the recruitment of
our associates very seriously...

04:01.339 --> 04:03.539
Cut the bullshit.

04:03.574 --> 04:06.008
I know what you were
doing there last night.

04:06.044 --> 04:08.744
And I'm not gonna
let you keep doing it.

04:08.780 --> 04:10.279
You're pretending
to recruit students

04:10.315 --> 04:11.892
so you can spend time with her
and win her back.

04:11.916 --> 04:13.049
And it's not gonna happen.

04:13.084 --> 04:14.128
That's not
what I was doing there.

04:14.152 --> 04:14.984
Well...

04:15.019 --> 04:16.652
you sure as hell weren't there

04:16.688 --> 04:17.987
to recruit a bunch
of associates

04:18.022 --> 04:19.988
for your shitty little firm.

04:21.059 --> 04:22.425
What'd you just say
about my firm?

04:22.460 --> 04:25.861
I said I work at Skadden,
Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.

04:25.897 --> 04:27.630
We're better than you.

04:27.665 --> 04:28.964
I'm better than you.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.700
And you better start
accepting that.

04:30.735 --> 04:31.979
You know what, Zander?
I wasn't there

04:32.003 --> 04:33.536
last night
to get Sheila back,

04:33.571 --> 04:35.204
and you're goddamn lucky
I wasn't.

04:35.239 --> 04:37.173
Because if I wanted her back,
she'd be mine.

04:37.208 --> 04:38.841
- That's a joke.
- You're a joke.

04:38.876 --> 04:40.743
And I'll tell you
something else.

04:40.778 --> 04:43.579
My name is on my firm.

04:43.614 --> 04:46.882
I've never heard of you,
so back off,

04:46.918 --> 04:48.050
or I'll take her from you.

04:48.086 --> 04:49.685
I don't think so.

04:49.721 --> 04:51.520
Because she chose me.

04:51.556 --> 04:53.322
So get your associates from NYU

04:53.358 --> 04:54.690
or some other
shitty law school.

04:54.726 --> 04:57.393
I don't really care.

04:57.428 --> 05:00.329
But stay the hell away
from my fiancée.

I was as surprised

05:43.584 --> 05:45.318
Well, I meant
it's not even 9:00

05:45.353 --> 05:47.331
and you're already coming to me
with that look on your face.

05:47.355 --> 05:48.621
What look on my face?

05:48.656 --> 05:50.489
The look that says
you're about to ask

05:50.525 --> 05:51.802
for something
that I won't want to do.

05:53.094 --> 05:54.660
Judge Ralls came to see me.

05:54.696 --> 05:56.507
You mean the judge
that oversaw your fraud case?

05:56.531 --> 05:58.208
She's been accused
of overturning a verdict

05:58.232 --> 06:00.366
for a company
that she has an interest in.

06:00.401 --> 06:01.867
- No.
- Harvey, I don't think

06:01.903 --> 06:04.437
she did it.
- We're trying to sign Techron.

06:04.472 --> 06:06.517
They've got a case that could
end up in front of Ralls.

06:06.541 --> 06:08.441
The second we agree
to represent her,

06:08.476 --> 06:10.710
we can kiss them good-bye.
- Okay, look, I...

06:10.745 --> 06:12.356
I don't want this to be
another prison case.

06:12.380 --> 06:13.857
So if you don't want
to do it, we won't, but...

06:13.881 --> 06:15.781
we were just on the right side
with Teddy.

06:15.817 --> 06:17.695
I thought it'd be nice for us
to be on the right side again.

06:17.719 --> 06:19.318
What do you mean us?

06:19.354 --> 06:21.198
Even if I said yes, you don't
need me to fight this.

06:21.222 --> 06:24.323
I heard about what happened
with Paula.

06:24.359 --> 06:25.869
I just thought that if we did
this thing together,

06:25.893 --> 06:27.827
maybe we could have some fun.

06:29.397 --> 06:31.664
In that case, get your shit.

06:31.699 --> 06:34.567
Brief me on the way.

06:34.602 --> 06:36.302
On our way where?

06:36.337 --> 06:38.738
If you know "A Few Good Men"
as well as you say you do,

06:38.773 --> 06:40.840
you'll be able to guess.

06:46.004 --> 06:47.670
- Thanks.
- Excuse me.

06:47.705 --> 06:49.605
Aren't you Donna Paulsen?

06:49.641 --> 06:52.642
I am, and who might you be?

06:52.677 --> 06:54.110
David Fox.

06:54.145 --> 06:55.812
Fox Commercial Leasing.
- Oh.

06:55.847 --> 06:57.458
I know who you are, Mr. Fox.
You own the building.

06:57.482 --> 06:58.781
Please, call me David.

06:58.817 --> 07:00.394
You know this isn't
the only building I own.

07:00.418 --> 07:02.485
Hmm, exactly how many
do you own?

07:02.520 --> 07:03.953
34.

07:03.988 --> 07:05.788
Well, David, if you think
telling me

07:05.824 --> 07:08.024
that you own 34 properties
is going to impress me,

07:08.059 --> 07:09.725
you just might be right.

07:09.761 --> 07:11.539
Well, I do love being right,
and you know what?

07:11.563 --> 07:14.163
I wish I could keep doing this
all day, but unfortunately,

07:14.199 --> 07:16.933
this isn't a social call.

07:16.968 --> 07:19.168
You want us to quadruple
our security deposit?

07:19.204 --> 07:21.771
You took Jessica Pearson's
name off the wall,

07:21.806 --> 07:24.807
and then you declared you want
nothing to do with her.

07:24.843 --> 07:27.877
That is a material change
in your firm.

07:27.912 --> 07:29.846
It could affect
your ability to make rent.

07:30.357 --> 07:32.190
Look.

07:32.225 --> 07:34.259
We did distance ourselves
from Jessica Pearson.

07:34.294 --> 07:35.571
But we also restructured
the firm,

07:35.595 --> 07:37.128
and we're stronger than ever.

07:37.164 --> 07:38.408
And if you need me
to show you the books

07:38.432 --> 07:39.831
to prove it,
I'm happy to do that.

07:39.866 --> 07:41.144
That's not gonna be
necessary, Donna,

07:41.168 --> 07:42.478
but look, I've got
this board of directors

07:42.502 --> 07:45.036
that I have to contend with,
so if you could

07:45.072 --> 07:48.006
draft a letter documenting
exactly what you just told me

07:48.041 --> 07:52.110
and hand-deliver it
to my office,

07:52.145 --> 07:53.845
I just might able
to keep them at bay.

07:53.880 --> 07:55.258
You know, if you wanted me
to come to your office,

07:55.282 --> 07:56.981
you could have just asked.

07:57.017 --> 07:58.350
I thought I just did.

08:04.758 --> 08:05.802
Katrina,
drop what you're doing.

08:05.826 --> 08:07.158
I need my black swan.

08:07.194 --> 08:09.260
Let me guess.
Zander Epstein.

08:09.296 --> 08:10.962
What?
How could you know that?

08:10.997 --> 08:12.875
When I saw the announcement
about Sheila's wedding,

08:12.899 --> 08:14.366
I knew there'd eventually
be a duel.

08:14.401 --> 08:16.768
Which is why I already started
digging into him.

08:16.803 --> 08:17.880
Well, then tell me
what you got,

08:17.904 --> 08:19.982
because I need to beat
this clown 19 ways from Sunday,

08:20.006 --> 08:21.284
and I've never even
heard of him.

08:21.308 --> 08:23.208
The reason you haven't
heard of him is because

08:23.243 --> 08:26.544
he's an expert in a very small
subset of technology law.

08:26.580 --> 08:28.513
Well, shit. I don't know
anything about tech law.

08:28.548 --> 08:30.715
But what you do know about
is having a huge chip

08:30.751 --> 08:32.217
on your shoulder
and using it to beat

08:32.251 --> 08:34.352
the shit out of anyone
who stands in your way.

08:34.388 --> 08:36.321
That I do.

08:36.356 --> 08:38.056
This is gonna be
one hell of a duel.

08:38.091 --> 08:40.725
I know. He's gonna be
the Burr to your Hamilton.

08:41.928 --> 08:42.894
But Hamilton dies.

08:42.929 --> 08:44.829
Not this time, Louis.

08:44.865 --> 08:45.997
Not this time.

08:50.637 --> 08:53.104
I don't get it.
How could I have guessed this?

08:53.140 --> 08:55.407
They didn't go to batting cages
in "A Few Good Men."

08:55.442 --> 08:58.977
No, but Tom Cruise says he
can think better with his bat.

08:59.012 --> 09:01.913
There is no way I could have
guessed that.

09:01.948 --> 09:03.815
All right, give me
the Cliff Notes.

09:03.850 --> 09:06.818
Two months ago,
PolyCode versus K Systems.

09:06.853 --> 09:08.720
Jury ruled in favor
of PolyCode.

09:08.755 --> 09:12.023
Ralls overturned the case
on its merits.

09:12.058 --> 09:14.125
Let me guess.
Whoever's representing PolyCode

09:14.161 --> 09:16.828
found out that Ralls has a ton
of money in K Systems.

09:16.863 --> 09:18.663
Exactly.

09:18.698 --> 09:19.998
But I talked
to her finance guy,

09:20.033 --> 09:21.733
and he says it's in a trust,

09:21.768 --> 09:23.513
it's blind, and he's willing
to put it in writing.

09:23.537 --> 09:24.969
Who's repping PolyCode?

09:25.005 --> 09:26.704
Smith and Devane.

09:26.740 --> 09:28.573
Well, they're not idiots.

09:28.608 --> 09:30.720
They've got to figure that
we could find proof like that.

09:30.744 --> 09:32.510
Yeah, so the only
question is,

09:32.546 --> 09:33.623
why do they think
they have a shot?

09:37.818 --> 09:40.852
Wait a second, what if they
don't think they have a shot?

09:40.887 --> 09:42.420
What are you talking about?

09:42.456 --> 09:43.900
You said you didn't want
to represent Ralls

09:43.924 --> 09:47.192
because it could affect
another case we might try.

09:47.227 --> 09:48.726
She gets put in review,

09:48.762 --> 09:50.540
she's gonna be kicked off
the bench for six months.

09:50.564 --> 09:52.697
Holy shit, they want
her off so she won't

09:52.732 --> 09:54.866
find against a different client
in an upcoming case.

09:54.901 --> 09:56.768
Which means if we can
get her to recuse herself

09:56.803 --> 09:58.848
from whatever the case is--
- They'll drop this bullshit

09:58.872 --> 10:00.004
like a hot potato.

10:00.040 --> 10:01.673
Well, look at that.

10:01.708 --> 10:03.575
I am having fun.

10:03.610 --> 10:05.243
Now I'm having even more fun

10:05.278 --> 10:06.611
because you hit like a monkey

10:06.646 --> 10:08.279
trying to have sex
with a buffalo.

10:09.416 --> 10:11.483
What kind of nature films
did you watch as a kid?

10:11.518 --> 10:13.184
I didn't watch any.

10:13.220 --> 10:15.153
I was too busy learning
how to hit a baseball.

10:22.548 --> 10:24.448
Ugh, what are you doing here?

10:24.483 --> 10:25.950
You said you're
the better lawyer.

10:25.985 --> 10:27.384
I thought we'd
put it to the test.

10:27.420 --> 10:28.953
You really want
to pick a fight

10:28.988 --> 10:30.888
with me in tech law?
I wrote the book on it.

10:30.923 --> 10:32.367
I don't care what
you wrote the book on.

10:32.391 --> 10:33.535
I just took my glove off
and slapped you

10:33.559 --> 10:34.458
in the face with it,
so are you gonna

10:34.493 --> 10:36.427
run to Mommy
or pick up a pistol?

10:36.462 --> 10:38.006
You don't have the standing
to bring this suit.

10:38.030 --> 10:39.964
Yes, I do, because one
of the massive banks

10:39.999 --> 10:41.565
in the area
I wrote the book on

10:41.601 --> 10:44.335
has a 40% stake
in Office Warehouse.

10:44.370 --> 10:46.270
And the new microchips
in your printers

10:46.305 --> 10:47.805
lock out our ink cartridge.

10:47.840 --> 10:49.373
Oh, I get it.

10:49.408 --> 10:52.009
You don't like
that we have the most exquisite

10:52.044 --> 10:53.777
piece of equipment ever made

10:53.813 --> 10:56.213
and the only cartridge
that will ever get to fill it

10:56.249 --> 11:00.317
with the full range of
proprietary ink again is mine.

11:00.353 --> 11:01.863
How dare you talk
about Sheila like that?

11:01.887 --> 11:03.387
Sheila?

11:03.422 --> 11:05.334
I thought we were talking
about who's the better lawyer.

11:05.358 --> 11:07.057
Because let me assure you,
no matter where

11:07.093 --> 11:09.293
this little charade ends,
you're gonna be left standing

11:09.328 --> 11:12.963
alone with nothing but
your Dictaphone in your hand.

11:12.999 --> 11:14.209
She told you
about my Dictaphone?

11:14.233 --> 11:16.767
She told me everything.

11:16.802 --> 11:18.102
Now get out of my office.

11:18.137 --> 11:19.737
I have to call my fiancée
and tell her

11:19.772 --> 11:21.772
I have a nuisance suit
to take care of.

11:27.545 --> 11:28.945
All right.

11:28.980 --> 11:30.179
Let's make this quick.

11:30.215 --> 11:32.415
I only have a 15-minute recess.

11:32.450 --> 11:33.883
This won't take
that much time

11:33.918 --> 11:35.952
as long as you're willing
to sign this.

11:35.987 --> 11:37.954
- What is this?
- You're recusing yourself

11:37.989 --> 11:39.700
from any cases being tried
by Smith and Devane

11:39.724 --> 11:40.857
for the next three years.

11:40.892 --> 11:42.191
And why would I agree
to that?

11:42.227 --> 11:43.259
Because if you do,

11:43.294 --> 11:44.794
this whole thing goes away.

11:44.829 --> 11:46.929
I don't care what happens
to this thing.

11:46.965 --> 11:48.898
It's blackmail,
and I'm not giving in to it.

11:48.933 --> 11:51.501
Listen to me, this avoids
even the rumor of something

11:51.536 --> 11:53.169
that could destroy
your reputation.

11:53.204 --> 11:54.315
That's what you came to me for.

11:54.339 --> 11:56.005
I came to you to defend me.

11:56.040 --> 11:57.306
We're offering you a way

11:57.342 --> 11:59.175
to get out
of needing a defense.

11:59.210 --> 12:00.977
What you're offering
is a chance

12:01.012 --> 12:02.111
to do something unethical.

12:02.146 --> 12:03.846
You don't do this,

12:03.882 --> 12:06.026
we have to argue this in front
of a judicial committee,

12:06.050 --> 12:07.995
which means all bets are off.
- I know what it means.

12:08.019 --> 12:09.785
And I don't care.

12:09.821 --> 12:11.954
So instead of trying
to broker some backroom deal,

12:11.990 --> 12:14.068
why don't you try to figure out
how to clear my name?

12:14.092 --> 12:15.925
Because I recuse myself,

12:15.960 --> 12:17.827
I might as well have
gotten paid to overrule

12:17.862 --> 12:19.862
that verdict
in the first place.

12:28.928 --> 12:29.928
Is this a bad time?

12:30.283 --> 12:31.181
You know, I don't think
it's possible

12:31.217 --> 12:33.117
to have a bad time
if you're around.

12:33.152 --> 12:33.951
Trust me, truer words

12:33.986 --> 12:35.753
were never spoken.

12:35.788 --> 12:37.399
And just to make your day
a little bit brighter,

12:37.423 --> 12:39.523
I have the letter you needed.

12:39.559 --> 12:41.492
Excellent.

12:41.527 --> 12:43.238
Now, I don't want you
to leave here empty-handed,

12:43.262 --> 12:45.529
so I got one for you too.

12:45.565 --> 12:47.498
Here you go.

12:49.302 --> 12:50.434
You're kicking us out?

12:50.469 --> 12:52.269
I'm giving you
90 days' notice.

12:52.305 --> 12:53.470
Then I'm kicking you out.

12:53.506 --> 12:55.205
That's a violation
of our lease.

12:55.241 --> 12:57.107
It would be
if you had a lease.

12:57.143 --> 12:58.654
It was rendered invalid
when you restructured,

12:58.678 --> 13:00.255
which, if I'm not mistaken,
you just gave me

13:00.279 --> 13:01.545
proof of right here.

13:01.581 --> 13:03.080
So all that concern
about us

13:03.115 --> 13:05.049
not being able to pay
our rent was just...

13:05.084 --> 13:06.550
I believe they call it
a ploy.

13:06.586 --> 13:08.519
Yeah, and I think we know
what they call you.

13:08.554 --> 13:09.386
Why are you doing this?

13:09.422 --> 13:10.354
You guys have been carrying

13:10.389 --> 13:13.190
a below-market lease for years.

13:13.225 --> 13:14.558
I saw the new girl
on the block

13:14.594 --> 13:16.371
get promoted to a job
she'd never done before.

13:16.395 --> 13:18.362
I took advantage.

13:18.397 --> 13:20.064
So all that flirting
was just bullshit?

13:20.099 --> 13:21.599
No, I never said that.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.267
This is business.
That was fun.

13:23.302 --> 13:25.169
Mm, well, I don't
find it fun.

13:25.204 --> 13:26.937
'Cause I may be the new girl
on the block,

13:26.973 --> 13:28.450
but you just picked a fight
with the best lawyers

13:28.474 --> 13:30.152
in the city, and in case
you haven't noticed,

13:30.176 --> 13:31.442
they're on the block too.

13:31.477 --> 13:33.544
You want to go tell
Harvey Specter and Louis Litt

13:33.579 --> 13:35.512
their new COO just got
served with that suit

13:35.548 --> 13:37.192
and cost them their home,
you go right ahead.

13:37.216 --> 13:40.384
Or you and I can quietly
amend the lease,

13:40.419 --> 13:43.320
the rent increases 100%
over three years,

13:43.356 --> 13:45.322
and no one ever has to know.

13:46.359 --> 13:47.891
I'm not letting you
get away with this.

13:59.113 --> 14:00.190
Sheila, what are
you doing here?

14:00.214 --> 14:02.047
Yeah, I'm not here
to answer questions, Louis.

14:02.082 --> 14:03.448
I'm here to ask them.

14:04.985 --> 14:07.219
What the hell are you doing
suing Zander?

14:07.254 --> 14:09.199
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm protecting my honor.

14:09.223 --> 14:11.957
Louis, I know it upset you to
see us together at my office,

14:11.992 --> 14:15.160
but I never thought you'd start
something like this.

14:15.195 --> 14:17.007
You know what, Sheila?
As far as I'm concerned,

14:17.031 --> 14:18.397
I didn't start anything.

14:18.432 --> 14:20.399
You did.
- What?

14:20.434 --> 14:22.034
I had nothing to do with this.

14:22.069 --> 14:23.280
You have everything
to do with it.

14:23.304 --> 14:24.870
I was living my life.

14:24.905 --> 14:26.038
You know what?

14:26.073 --> 14:28.040
I was dumb enough

14:28.075 --> 14:30.742
to think that fate
finally got it right,

14:30.778 --> 14:32.923
that there was a reason that
you were back here in New York

14:32.947 --> 14:35.058
and that you would figure out
that that reason was me.

14:35.082 --> 14:36.960
But when I saw you with him,
when I heard you tell him

14:36.984 --> 14:38.828
that you just don't know
what you ever saw in me,

14:38.852 --> 14:41.320
and then that dick
shows up at my office

14:41.355 --> 14:43.021
to tell me to stay away
from you.

14:43.057 --> 14:46.558
So you engineered a lawsuit
to get me back?

14:46.593 --> 14:48.004
Because, Louis,
that's not gonna happen.

14:48.028 --> 14:49.139
I know it's not gonna
happen.

14:49.163 --> 14:50.128
That's not what this is about.

14:50.164 --> 14:51.196
Then what is this about?

14:51.231 --> 14:53.131
I told you
what this is about.

14:53.167 --> 14:54.733
It's about my honor.

14:58.739 --> 15:00.439
I don't get the girl.

15:01.809 --> 15:04.009
I don't get to be happy.

15:05.679 --> 15:08.580
But at least I get to beat
this asshole into the ground.

15:10.684 --> 15:13.085
Louis, if you do this,

15:13.120 --> 15:15.487
he's going to find out
about us.

15:15.522 --> 15:17.756
And it's gonna ruin
my relationship...

15:18.926 --> 15:20.926
And ruin my life.

15:20.961 --> 15:22.794
Sheila, you have my word.

15:22.830 --> 15:25.864
I won't let that happen
no matter what.

15:25.899 --> 15:27.599
Okay, Louis.

15:27.634 --> 15:29.735
I just hope you know
what you're doing.

15:38.990 --> 15:41.224
Rachel, I need you to drop
whatever it is you're doing

15:41.259 --> 15:43.304
and come up with a lawsuit
that sends the son of a bitch

15:43.328 --> 15:44.568
who owns this building
to prison

15:44.596 --> 15:45.940
for the rest
of his miserable life.

15:45.964 --> 15:47.196
Okay, calm down.

15:47.232 --> 15:48.931
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

15:48.967 --> 15:50.500
Our landlord tricked me
into admitting

15:50.535 --> 15:52.168
that we restructured the firm,

15:52.203 --> 15:54.904
and now he's filed suit
to evict us in 90 days.

15:54.939 --> 15:56.239
Donna, this is bad.

15:56.274 --> 15:58.341
You have to get Harvey
and Louis involved.

15:58.376 --> 16:00.476
Rachel, I can't go to Harvey
with this right now.

16:00.512 --> 16:02.612
I just--I can't.

16:02.647 --> 16:04.313
Donna, what's going on?

16:09.254 --> 16:11.320
- I kissed him.
- What?

16:11.356 --> 16:13.067
I knew things were getting
serious with Paula,

16:13.091 --> 16:15.124
and I just--I had to know.

16:15.160 --> 16:16.859
Donna, that's huge.

16:16.895 --> 16:18.361
That's not the point, Rachel.

16:18.396 --> 16:21.397
But I feel terrible because...

16:21.433 --> 16:23.399
Harvey and Paula
aren't together anymore.

16:23.435 --> 16:25.346
And there's no way you're
gonna be responsible for that

16:25.370 --> 16:27.136
and for the firm
losing its home.

16:27.172 --> 16:28.871
No, there's not.

16:28.907 --> 16:31.874
Okay, we might be able to
find a way to fix this thing,

16:31.910 --> 16:34.610
but it can't be bullshit.

16:34.646 --> 16:37.280
Then let's come up with
something that's not bullshit.

16:42.871 --> 16:44.437
You were right, Mike.

16:44.473 --> 16:46.940
I needed the distraction.

16:46.975 --> 16:47.975
Thanks.

16:50.512 --> 16:52.378
Harvey, I know it's
none of my business

16:52.414 --> 16:54.714
and you probably don't want
to talk about it, but...

16:56.284 --> 16:57.884
What happened with Paula?

17:04.893 --> 17:06.459
Donna kissed me.

17:08.630 --> 17:09.630
What?

17:12.867 --> 17:14.800
It was after Malik was over,

17:14.836 --> 17:16.769
and out of the clear blue sky,

17:16.805 --> 17:18.805
Donna kissed me.

17:18.839 --> 17:21.140
Look, it's a long story,
but it led me to realize

17:21.175 --> 17:23.041
that Paula's not the one.

17:24.445 --> 17:25.712
Because Donna is?

17:25.747 --> 17:27.380
That's not what I'm saying.

17:27.415 --> 17:29.582
Then what are you saying?

17:29.618 --> 17:32.552
I'm saying that you should
know better than anyone

17:32.587 --> 17:36.189
that sometimes shit happens
you couldn't see coming.

17:36.224 --> 17:38.224
It knocks you
into a different life,

17:38.260 --> 17:40.326
and this is one of those times.

17:42.364 --> 17:44.597
Maybe you couldn't have
seen it coming, but...

17:46.134 --> 17:47.634
I think I should have.

17:48.637 --> 17:50.136
What are you talking about?

17:51.973 --> 17:53.540
You're gonna be pissed.

17:55.010 --> 17:57.010
That night before
we went to see Malik,

17:57.045 --> 18:01.014
I kind of told Donna that
if she had feelings for you

18:01.049 --> 18:04.317
that she better tell you
before it was too late.

18:05.921 --> 18:08.187
Look, I didn't think
she was gonna kiss you.

18:09.124 --> 18:11.257
It's okay, Mike.

18:11.293 --> 18:13.159
You couldn't have known
she was gonna do that.

18:17.132 --> 18:19.799
Wait a second.
You couldn't have known.

18:19.834 --> 18:21.501
What?

18:22.030 --> 18:23.563
We couldn't have
known that Ralls

18:23.598 --> 18:24.964
wouldn't recuse herself,

18:25.000 --> 18:27.500
which means they won't know
she didn't.

18:29.571 --> 18:31.404
Are you talking
about forging her signature?

18:31.440 --> 18:32.572
Yeah, I am.

18:32.607 --> 18:35.809
We get Smith and Devane
to sign off in writing,

18:35.844 --> 18:37.544
that's as good
as them admitting

18:37.579 --> 18:39.379
that they fabricated
this whole thing.

18:39.414 --> 18:41.381
I don't know how I feel
about crossing that line.

18:41.416 --> 18:42.649
Mike, we've done a lot worse

18:42.684 --> 18:44.184
for people
that deserve a lot less.

18:44.219 --> 18:46.119
You yourself said
that she deserves this.

18:49.858 --> 18:51.191
Okay.

18:54.529 --> 18:56.262
Okay, let's do it.

19:02.318 --> 19:04.885
- I hope you're ready, Epstein.
- Oh, I'm ready, Litt.

19:04.921 --> 19:06.632
You sure? Because I have
a little precedent in my pocket

19:06.656 --> 19:08.089
by the name
of Jenkins v. Sanders.

19:08.124 --> 19:09.824
Which might frighten me
if Howell v. Munley

19:09.859 --> 19:11.759
didn't trump Sanders in 2010.

19:11.794 --> 19:13.472
Well, then it's a good thing
that I brought a little vixen

19:13.496 --> 19:15.162
to the party by the name
of U.S. v. Xerox.

19:15.198 --> 19:17.231
Oh, I guess someone
didn't hear the news.

19:17.651 --> 19:19.150
Xerox was overturned last week.

19:19.185 --> 19:20.985
- Bullshit.
- Okay.

19:21.021 --> 19:23.221
It is bullshit.
But it doesn't matter.

19:23.256 --> 19:25.590
Because that only applies
to analog technology,

19:25.625 --> 19:28.559
which hasn't been relevant
in, mm, 40 years.

19:28.595 --> 19:30.406
And whatever else you have
doesn't matter either

19:30.430 --> 19:32.063
because I've got a stack
of precedents

19:32.098 --> 19:35.667
up to your fat face that'll
crush anything you bring up.

19:40.440 --> 19:41.305
Okay, change of plans.

19:41.341 --> 19:42.385
We need to file
a motion to delete

19:42.409 --> 19:44.442
this motherfucker's products
from our store.

19:44.477 --> 19:45.877
Louis, you can't do that.

19:45.912 --> 19:47.645
Yes, I can,
and I'm going to.

19:47.681 --> 19:49.747
What is wrong with you?
We have a solid plan.

19:49.783 --> 19:51.527
Don't you get it? We picked
a fight beyond our depth.

19:51.551 --> 19:52.895
He's gonna kills us
unless I do this.

19:52.919 --> 19:54.652
Louis, if we pull a product

19:54.688 --> 19:56.421
from one of our biggest
client's shelves

19:56.456 --> 19:58.300
without their permission,
they will go ape-shit.

19:58.324 --> 19:59.524
I don't care.

19:59.559 --> 20:00.858
Well, I do.

20:00.894 --> 20:02.427
And I'm not gonna
let you do it.

20:02.462 --> 20:03.739
All right,
what are we doing here?

20:03.763 --> 20:05.329
Time-out.

20:05.365 --> 20:07.699
- What?
- A postponement, Your Honor.

20:07.734 --> 20:10.301
I request a postponement.
- On what grounds?

20:10.336 --> 20:13.171
One minute ago, he was ready
to go toe-to-toe with me.

20:13.206 --> 20:15.206
I...

20:15.241 --> 20:16.274
I, um...

20:16.309 --> 20:17.642
It's my fault, Your Honor.

20:17.677 --> 20:20.144
I brought the wrong case files
to court.

20:20.180 --> 20:24.682
Please don't punish Mr. Litt
for my incompetence.

20:26.453 --> 20:29.620
All right, we will postpone
until tomorrow.

20:29.656 --> 20:31.456
But you two better get
your act together.

20:31.491 --> 20:34.659
This court does not appreciate
having its time wasted.

20:34.694 --> 20:36.661
Thank you, Your Honor.

20:36.899 --> 20:38.866
Look, I'm sorry, Louis,
but if I didn't do that,

20:38.901 --> 20:40.501
we'd lose this client.
- It's okay.

20:40.536 --> 20:41.680
Louis is used to losing things.

20:41.704 --> 20:43.404
Cases. Women.

20:43.439 --> 20:44.805
You smug dick.

20:44.840 --> 20:46.707
You think I'm the one
losing Sheila?

20:46.742 --> 20:48.309
I think you lost her
a long time ago,

20:48.344 --> 20:50.181
and now you're showing
everyone why.

20:50.281 --> 20:52.114
Well, you're
showing everybody

20:52.149 --> 20:53.393
that you're the most
pathetic piece of shit

20:53.417 --> 20:55.084
that ever lived.
- Yeah? And why is that?

20:55.119 --> 20:56.563
Because I'm the one
screwing your fiancée

20:56.587 --> 20:59.521
behind your back
and in front of it too.

20:59.557 --> 21:01.190
- What?
- Oh, yeah, last Tuesday,

21:01.225 --> 21:02.436
we played cops and robbers,
and I vandalized her

21:02.460 --> 21:03.359
all night long.

21:03.394 --> 21:05.294
- No, that can't be true.
- Oh, it's true.

21:05.329 --> 21:06.795
Because you may be
the one she wants,

21:06.831 --> 21:08.697
but I'm the one she needs.

21:12.806 --> 21:15.506
Louis, please tell me
you didn't say that to him.

21:15.542 --> 21:17.008
No, I didn't,
but I wanted to.

21:17.043 --> 21:18.543
And I have to, I will.

21:18.578 --> 21:20.478
Louis, you can't do that.

21:20.513 --> 21:21.813
You gave Sheila your word.

21:21.848 --> 21:23.614
I don't care.
I need to win this case.

21:23.650 --> 21:25.717
And if you use your affair
to do that,

21:25.752 --> 21:27.752
you will regret it
the rest of your life.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.765
But if I lose, I'll have
to live the rest of my life

21:29.789 --> 21:31.823
knowing that he got the better
of me in everything.

21:31.858 --> 21:35.893
Then find a way to win
without using that tactic.

21:35.929 --> 21:37.795
Because if you can't do that,

21:37.831 --> 21:40.798
I believe we must stop
seeing each other.

21:40.834 --> 21:42.734
- What?
- Louis,

21:42.769 --> 21:45.203
I don't say it lightly,
but I have taken an oath

21:45.238 --> 21:47.205
to do no harm.

21:47.240 --> 21:50.441
And lately I have been feeling

21:50.477 --> 21:52.655
our relationship is doing harm.
- How could you say that?

21:52.679 --> 21:54.212
You said that you would
never leave me.

21:54.247 --> 21:55.613
I know.

21:55.648 --> 21:58.516
And it would cause me
great pain.

21:58.551 --> 22:03.221
But my oath to my profession is
greater than my words to you.

22:03.256 --> 22:06.424
And if my willing to leave you
does not prevent you

22:06.459 --> 22:10.261
from hurting the woman
you claim to love,

22:10.296 --> 22:13.531
then what we are doing here
is not working.

22:25.612 --> 22:27.479
Donna.

22:27.514 --> 22:30.582
To what do I owe the pleasure?
- Got a present for you.

22:32.920 --> 22:34.653
All right, let me
get this straight.

22:34.688 --> 22:35.654
You're trying to use a statute
meant to protect squatters

22:35.689 --> 22:38.323
to keep your lease?
- Not trying.

22:38.359 --> 22:40.492
Doing, and that suit's
already been filed.

22:40.527 --> 22:42.494
So you can either
spend more in legal fees

22:42.529 --> 22:43.707
than you'll make
increasing our rent,

22:43.731 --> 22:45.430
or you can drop
this whole thing.

22:45.466 --> 22:48.633
I-I got to admit, this is--
this is very impressive.

22:48.669 --> 22:50.769
Except for one little thing.
- What's that?

22:50.804 --> 22:53.271
The clause in your lease
which states

22:53.307 --> 22:54.606
if the tenant
initiates a lawsuit

22:54.641 --> 22:56.608
prior to engaging
in arbitration,

22:56.643 --> 22:59.411
I have the right to terminate
your lease within 30 days.

22:59.446 --> 23:01.213
We didn't initiate
the lawsuit. You did.

23:01.248 --> 23:02.581
Did I?

23:02.616 --> 23:04.082
That lawsuit was never filed.

23:04.118 --> 23:06.451
Wow, you son of a bitch.

23:06.487 --> 23:07.886
You have so little respect
for me

23:07.921 --> 23:09.721
that you would deal
in bad faith twice?

23:09.757 --> 23:12.391
Hey, look, I did
what I had to do, all right?

23:12.426 --> 23:14.226
And look, this isn't personal.

23:14.261 --> 23:16.728
Donna, I told you I own
buildings all over the city.

23:16.764 --> 23:18.263
Right? I wouldn't
be able to do that

23:18.298 --> 23:19.309
if I didn't know how to get
what I want.

23:19.333 --> 23:21.199
And when word gets out

23:21.235 --> 23:22.312
that you treat your tenants
like this,

23:22.336 --> 23:23.546
those buildings aren't
gonna be worth shit.

23:23.570 --> 23:25.637
Trust me, when you got
views like mine

23:25.672 --> 23:28.507
from Central Park
to Battery Park,

23:28.542 --> 23:30.442
people don't care
how they're treated.

23:30.477 --> 23:32.110
They just want in.

23:32.146 --> 23:33.356
As a matter of fact,
I might have something

23:33.380 --> 23:34.624
for you on the other side
of town.

23:34.648 --> 23:35.759
I think you guys
are gonna love it,

23:35.783 --> 23:37.516
'cause now that you've
filed this,

23:37.551 --> 23:40.018
you're gonna be moving
sooner than you thought.

23:45.559 --> 23:47.059
Ms. Shear?

23:47.094 --> 23:48.960
Mike Ross.
This is Harvey Specter.

23:48.996 --> 23:51.274
I'm sorry. Do I have a case
against you I don't know about?

23:51.298 --> 23:53.598
We're representing
Judge Sandra Ralls.

23:53.634 --> 23:55.067
Then I guess I do.

23:55.102 --> 23:56.212
Unless, of course,
you want to

23:56.236 --> 23:58.136
withdraw your complaint
against her.

23:58.172 --> 23:59.172
And why would I do that?

23:59.206 --> 24:01.239
Because we have
a signed agreement

24:01.275 --> 24:03.442
saying she'll recuse herself

24:03.477 --> 24:06.211
from Exodyne versus
the State of New York.

24:07.581 --> 24:09.347
I'm afraid
that's not good enough.

24:09.383 --> 24:10.649
Are you kidding me?

24:10.684 --> 24:12.517
She's stepping down
from a huge case

24:12.553 --> 24:14.431
that you have pending with her
which we all know

24:14.455 --> 24:15.887
is what this
is really about.

24:15.923 --> 24:18.223
What this is really about,
Mr. Ross,

24:18.258 --> 24:20.025
is removing a judge
from the bench

24:20.060 --> 24:22.194
who's demonstrated an inability
to follow the law.

24:22.229 --> 24:24.229
Bullshit. She followed
the law in your case.

24:24.264 --> 24:25.964
You just didn't like
the result.

24:25.999 --> 24:27.444
Then why don't you ask her
if she followed the law

24:27.468 --> 24:29.000
in the Sullivan case
12 years ago?

24:29.036 --> 24:30.213
What the hell
are you talking about?

24:30.237 --> 24:33.171
Your client takes matters
into her own hands.

24:33.207 --> 24:36.408
She did it 12 years ago.
She did it two months ago.

24:36.443 --> 24:38.477
God knows how many times
she's done it in between.

24:38.512 --> 24:40.579
But she's never going
to do it again.

24:40.614 --> 24:42.948
That woman has more integrity
in her little finger

24:42.983 --> 24:44.394
than you have in your entire--
- Mike, that's enough.

24:44.418 --> 24:45.984
You make an accusation
like that,

24:46.019 --> 24:47.486
you better
damn well have proof.

24:47.521 --> 24:49.488
Because if you smear
this woman's reputation

24:49.523 --> 24:53.258
without cause, I will make it
my life's mission to bury you.

24:53.293 --> 24:56.595
Then instead of coming
at me with empty threats,

24:56.630 --> 24:59.331
why don't you ask
your client what she did?

25:05.338 --> 25:07.705
What are you doing
bursting in here unannounced?

25:07.740 --> 25:09.773
We just came
from Smith and Devane.

25:09.809 --> 25:11.575
They're throwing around
some Sullivan case

25:11.611 --> 25:13.451
like it means something,
and you better tell us

25:13.479 --> 25:15.646
what they're talking about
right now, or we're gone.

25:18.217 --> 25:20.184
It was 12 years ago.

25:20.219 --> 25:22.319
I was a new judge.

25:22.355 --> 25:25.356
And there was a 16-year-old kid
with the worst public defender

25:25.391 --> 25:27.157
I've ever seen.

25:27.193 --> 25:30.294
It was bad enough I had
to rule in favor of this boy

25:30.329 --> 25:32.796
being tried as an adult,

25:32.832 --> 25:35.799
but when he was offered
a plea deal and this moron

25:35.835 --> 25:38.269
wanted to take it to trial,

25:38.304 --> 25:40.671
I couldn't sit by
and watch.

25:40.706 --> 25:43.407
I don't understand. Why not
just declare a mistrial?

25:43.442 --> 25:45.242
Because having
a shitty lawyer

25:45.278 --> 25:46.610
isn't grounds for that.

25:46.646 --> 25:48.279
So instead
you had direct contact

25:48.314 --> 25:49.992
with the defendant?
- Harvey, take it easy.

25:50.016 --> 25:51.448
She was just trying
to help a kid.

25:51.484 --> 25:53.328
I don't give a shit if
she's trying to cure cancer.

25:53.352 --> 25:55.486
It's illegal.
She didn't tell us about it.

25:55.521 --> 25:57.321
I'm not losing a client
for a judge

25:57.356 --> 26:00.090
who can't even tell
her own lawyers the truth.

26:00.126 --> 26:03.460
You want to know what kind
of judge I am?

26:03.496 --> 26:06.163
Anita Gibbs came to me
to wiretap your phones

26:06.198 --> 26:07.698
because she knew in her gut

26:07.733 --> 26:10.000
he was a fraud
and you were in on it.

26:10.036 --> 26:12.036
She had everyone
from the attorney general

26:12.071 --> 26:14.004
to the governor's office call
to make me do it,

26:14.040 --> 26:15.306
I said no

26:15.341 --> 26:17.308
because they didn't have
probable cause.

26:17.343 --> 26:19.076
Are you saying I owe you?

26:19.111 --> 26:21.512
I'm saying I made one mistake

26:21.547 --> 26:23.647
12 years ago,

26:23.683 --> 26:25.349
and our system relies

26:25.384 --> 26:29.386
on having people like me
up on that bench

26:29.422 --> 26:32.323
so that when people like you
get in front of us,

26:32.358 --> 26:34.959
you don't go straight
to prison.

26:42.399 --> 26:43.710
Katrina, if you're here
to tell me we've got nothing,

26:43.734 --> 26:45.200
it's gonna have to wait
because--

26:45.235 --> 26:46.701
I'm not here
to tell you that, Louis.

26:46.737 --> 26:48.670
I'm here to tell you
we have everything.

26:48.705 --> 26:50.171
- What?
- I heard him talk

26:50.207 --> 26:51.606
about digital versus analog,

26:51.641 --> 26:53.441
which got me thinking.

26:53.477 --> 26:56.311
Tech law has its basis
in copyright law,

26:56.346 --> 26:57.812
which means--
- Holy shit.

26:57.848 --> 26:59.280
Xerox applies after all.

26:59.316 --> 27:00.648
Exactly.

27:00.684 --> 27:02.417
We got him.

27:02.452 --> 27:03.830
All you have to do
is show him this,

27:03.854 --> 27:06.454
and he will collapse
like a premature soufflé.

27:08.792 --> 27:10.625
You do it.

27:10.660 --> 27:12.160
- Louis, I can't.
- Why not?

27:12.195 --> 27:13.639
Because the whole reason
we're doing this

27:13.663 --> 27:15.196
is to give you the satisfaction

27:15.232 --> 27:16.476
of seeing that bastard
humiliated.

27:16.500 --> 27:18.266
Katrina,
don't you understand?

27:18.301 --> 27:19.379
If that happens, he's gonna say
something horrible,

27:19.403 --> 27:21.403
then I'm gonna say something
horrible back,

27:21.438 --> 27:23.738
and then I'm gonna
be tempted to tell him that--

27:23.774 --> 27:26.608
Tell him what?

27:26.643 --> 27:28.376
Never mind.
I can handle it.

27:28.412 --> 27:30.045
Louis, what's going on?

27:30.080 --> 27:31.691
What's going on is,
I do not want to sully you

27:31.715 --> 27:33.181
with my sordid personal life.

27:33.216 --> 27:34.716
I got myself into this mess,

27:34.751 --> 27:37.519
and you did everything you can
to get me out of it.

27:37.554 --> 27:40.188
The rest I have to do myself,
so thank you.

27:55.305 --> 27:57.072
Donna, can I talk to you
for a second?

27:57.107 --> 27:59.507
No, Rachel, you can't because
I'm too busy freaking out.

27:59.543 --> 28:01.309
Freaking out about what?
We had him.

28:01.344 --> 28:02.644
It didn't work.

28:02.679 --> 28:04.123
There's a clause
in our lease that says

28:04.147 --> 28:05.458
if we skip arbitration,
he can kick us out

28:05.482 --> 28:06.381
in 30 days, not 90.

28:06.416 --> 28:08.383
No, that's only if we

28:08.418 --> 28:09.451
started the litigation.

28:09.486 --> 28:10.785
We didn't.
He sued us.

28:10.821 --> 28:13.254
- Not officially.
- What?

28:13.290 --> 28:15.123
You told me that--
- I didn't understand

28:15.158 --> 28:17.225
when I told you.

28:17.260 --> 28:18.404
Donna, you have
to tell Harvey.

28:18.428 --> 28:19.227
- I can't.
- Okay, then

28:19.262 --> 28:20.195
you have to tell Louis.

28:20.230 --> 28:23.064
Paula wanted Harvey
to get rid of me.

28:23.100 --> 28:24.666
What--

28:24.701 --> 28:26.434
what are you talking about?

28:26.470 --> 28:29.471
I didn't tell you
the whole story.

28:29.506 --> 28:31.517
She wanted me gone, and Harvey
didn't want to fire me,

28:31.541 --> 28:34.042
so he went to Stu Buzzini
and got him to offer me a job.

28:34.077 --> 28:35.721
And I was gonna to take it,
but then at the last minute,

28:35.745 --> 28:37.345
Harvey changed his mind.

28:39.416 --> 28:41.316
He chose me over her.

28:42.886 --> 28:45.353
And it was only a few days ago,
and I can't be responsible

28:45.388 --> 28:49.257
for losing the only home
that this firm has ever had.

28:49.292 --> 28:51.159
Donna, I understand
all of that.

28:51.194 --> 28:53.995
But if you let your guilt
keep you

28:54.030 --> 28:56.164
from giving him a chance
to fix this thing

28:56.199 --> 28:58.166
before it's too late,

28:58.201 --> 29:00.435
he's gonna wish
you took that job.

29:00.470 --> 29:02.070
Okay.

29:03.607 --> 29:05.006
I'll tell him.

29:06.276 --> 29:08.516
Harvey. I've gone through
the files on the Sullivan case.

29:08.891 --> 29:10.457
You did what?

29:10.492 --> 29:11.792
Why would you do that?

29:11.827 --> 29:13.627
Because the panel's
in two days.

29:13.662 --> 29:14.628
We need to be prepared
for whatever

29:14.663 --> 29:15.774
they're gonna throw at Ralls.

29:15.798 --> 29:17.731
No, we don't,
because I'm not risking

29:17.766 --> 29:18.910
having to drop another client

29:18.934 --> 29:20.400
for someone
who lied to my face.

29:20.436 --> 29:22.769
I'm sorry,
were you in that room?

29:22.805 --> 29:24.971
If she hadn't denied that
wiretap, I wouldn't have been

29:25.007 --> 29:26.907
the only one in prison,
and you know that.

29:26.942 --> 29:28.920
Okay, why do you think she
brought that up to you, Mike?

29:28.944 --> 29:30.755
I don't know. Maybe
to show us why she deserves

29:30.779 --> 29:32.612
to be on the bench.
- Bullshit.

29:32.648 --> 29:34.426
She did it to make you feel
like you owe her something,

29:34.450 --> 29:36.516
which is why she came to you
in the first place.

29:36.552 --> 29:37.784
It's because you're a sucker.

29:39.388 --> 29:41.388
Okay.
Well, you know what, Harvey?

29:41.423 --> 29:42.856
I'd rather be a sucker
than someone

29:42.891 --> 29:45.692
who refuses to sacrifice
anything for anyone else.

29:45.728 --> 29:47.360
What the fuck did you
just say to me?

29:47.396 --> 29:50.497
I said I don't give a shit
what we lose.

29:50.532 --> 29:52.466
This woman did us a favor,

29:52.501 --> 29:54.279
and I'm not gonna hang her
out to dry just because

29:54.303 --> 29:56.303
you don't want to sacrifice
a piece of business.

29:56.338 --> 29:58.772
I sacrificed more
than just business this week

29:58.807 --> 30:00.841
all because you couldn't keep
your mouth shut.

30:00.876 --> 30:02.642
Are you ser--
Are you really

30:02.678 --> 30:04.277
making this
about Donna right now

30:04.313 --> 30:05.690
when we got a woman's future
on the line?

30:05.714 --> 30:06.813
Don't give me that shit.

30:06.849 --> 30:08.348
You made it about Donna

30:08.383 --> 30:09.816
when you said
I couldn't sacrifice.

30:09.852 --> 30:11.918
I sacrificed everything.

30:11.954 --> 30:13.920
- Harvey--
- Enough.

30:13.956 --> 30:15.734
You said you didn't want this
to be another prison case.

30:15.758 --> 30:17.691
Well, it is
another prison case,

30:17.726 --> 30:21.895
and I'm saying
we're dropping it.

30:21.930 --> 30:24.097
Okay, well, as long as we're
talking about sacrifice

30:24.133 --> 30:27.234
and prison, one of us went
to prison for the other one,

30:27.269 --> 30:29.436
and the woman you're
about to cut loose?

30:29.471 --> 30:31.338
She's the reason
that was possible.

30:42.219 --> 30:43.252
Thanks.

30:48.192 --> 30:49.737
Did you come to drop
this thing in person?

30:49.761 --> 30:51.294
Because if you're nice,

30:51.329 --> 30:53.396
I might let you avoid
being humiliated in court.

30:53.431 --> 30:54.775
You're the one
who's gonna be humiliated

30:54.799 --> 30:56.065
if this goes to court.

30:56.100 --> 30:58.034
Oh, good playground retort,
Litt.

30:58.069 --> 31:00.247
Then again, I guess a loser
like you had a lot of practice.

31:00.271 --> 31:02.838
How's this for a retort,
Zander?

31:05.176 --> 31:07.710
We go to court, that's
what everyone's gonna see.

31:12.016 --> 31:13.816
- What do you want?
- $30 million.

31:13.985 --> 31:15.333
And I want it written
in the settlement

31:15.334 --> 31:17.069
that Louis Litt
is a superior lawyer

31:17.070 --> 31:18.039
to Zander Epstein.

31:18.040 --> 31:19.405
- No way.
- Yeah way.

31:19.441 --> 31:21.207
- You're really that petty?
- You can bury it

31:21.243 --> 31:23.843
in the fine print
if you want.

31:23.879 --> 31:25.511
You can put it in Latin
if you want.

31:25.547 --> 31:27.180
But it's going in there,

31:27.215 --> 31:29.983
and you're always gonna
know it's there.

31:30.018 --> 31:31.417
Okay.

31:31.453 --> 31:34.754
If that's what it takes
to make you whole,

31:34.789 --> 31:37.891
then we have a deal,
but one thing.

31:37.926 --> 31:40.927
When I get home tonight,
remember who's waiting for me.

31:40.962 --> 31:43.897
And she's gonna cook me dinner,
she's gonna rub my feet,

31:43.932 --> 31:45.398
she's gonna tell me
she loves me,

31:45.433 --> 31:48.134
and we are never gonna
think of you again.

31:48.169 --> 31:50.336
Well, maybe on
our 50th wedding anniversary,

31:50.372 --> 31:54.007
we'll laugh about the guy
she almost ended up with,

31:54.042 --> 31:55.942
if we can even remember
your name.

31:58.947 --> 32:01.114
Now it's $50 million.

32:01.149 --> 32:03.850
And that's take it or leave it.

32:16.056 --> 32:17.322
Look, whatever it is,

32:17.357 --> 32:18.957
I'm kind of in the middle
of something.

32:18.992 --> 32:20.436
Well, I hope you're
in the middle of keeping

32:20.460 --> 32:22.394
Ralls on the bench.
- Maybe.

32:23.864 --> 32:26.197
Mike, I'm sorry
about last night.

32:26.233 --> 32:28.099
Truth is, it's been
an emotional week,

32:28.135 --> 32:30.735
and when you accused me
of never sacrificing--

32:30.771 --> 32:31.851
I shouldn't have said that.

32:33.240 --> 32:36.308
You've sacrificed for me
hundreds of times.

32:36.343 --> 32:38.343
I know that.
- More like thousands.

32:40.747 --> 32:42.647
Now, what do you got?

32:42.683 --> 32:45.183
Well, I got to thinking,

32:45.218 --> 32:47.152
how the hell did
that woman even know

32:47.187 --> 32:48.653
about what Ralls
did with Sullivan?

32:48.689 --> 32:50.655
I'm guessing
you've got an answer.

32:50.691 --> 32:53.258
Turns out that shitty
public defender--

32:53.293 --> 32:55.727
Smith and Devane hired him
six months ago.

32:55.762 --> 32:58.029
But the thing is,
six months ago,

32:58.065 --> 32:59.976
her docket hadn't been set
that far in the future.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.067
Which means this whole thing
was a setup

33:02.102 --> 33:03.802
for a case
that already happened.

33:03.837 --> 33:06.204
Think about it.
She gets thrown off the bench,

33:06.224 --> 33:08.258
every one of her rulings
for the last seven years

33:08.293 --> 33:10.026
is automatically subject
to appeal.

33:10.061 --> 33:12.061
Mike, this is great.
We got 'em.

33:12.097 --> 33:15.732
The only problem is,
I can't figure out which case

33:15.767 --> 33:16.978
because Smith and Devane didn't

33:17.002 --> 33:19.105
represent anyone
she ruled against.

33:19.106 --> 33:21.373
Well, what kind of cases did
she hear during that period?

33:21.408 --> 33:23.241
Mostly federal antitrust.

33:24.578 --> 33:26.812
Then I know who can help us.

33:33.921 --> 33:35.620
Sheila.

33:35.656 --> 33:37.122
What are you doing here?

33:37.310 --> 33:39.043
I talked to Zander earlier,
and he told me

33:39.079 --> 33:40.478
you two had
a settlement meeting.

33:40.513 --> 33:42.480
Is that what he said?

33:42.515 --> 33:45.149
I would describe it as more
of a beatdown, but whatever.

33:46.519 --> 33:48.853
- Thank you, Louis.
- Why are you thanking me?

33:50.090 --> 33:52.657
- For not telling him about us.
- Never crossed my mind.

33:52.692 --> 33:54.325
You asked me not to,
so I didn't.

33:54.361 --> 33:56.928
And now I have to ask you
for one more thing.

33:58.665 --> 34:00.365
Please let this case go.

34:00.400 --> 34:02.934
- What?
- Give him a way to save face,

34:02.969 --> 34:04.702
and let this thing go.

34:04.738 --> 34:06.315
I gave him a way.
It's called a settlement.

34:06.339 --> 34:08.072
No, you jacked up
the settlement

34:08.108 --> 34:09.706
and added in some nonsense

34:09.743 --> 34:11.152
about admitting
you're the better man.

34:11.177 --> 34:13.011
I am the better man.

34:13.045 --> 34:15.713
Then prove it
by being the bigger man.

34:15.748 --> 34:17.014
- Sheila--
- Louis,

34:17.050 --> 34:18.983
I'm getting married
in a few days,

34:19.018 --> 34:21.985
and all my fiancé
can think about is you.

34:22.022 --> 34:24.188
You won.

34:24.224 --> 34:27.425
You beat him,
and he knows it.

34:27.460 --> 34:29.827
Please do this for me.

34:29.862 --> 34:31.795
Because if you don't,

34:31.831 --> 34:33.576
you might as well
have just told him about us

34:33.600 --> 34:34.966
in the first place.

34:47.378 --> 34:48.978
Rachel, we need to talk.

34:49.013 --> 34:51.581
- What did Harvey say?
- I didn't go to Harvey.

34:51.616 --> 34:53.181
Donna, why not?

34:53.217 --> 34:55.284
Because he was busy
with something else,

34:55.320 --> 34:57.253
and I remembered
one of the reasons

34:57.288 --> 34:59.188
he promoted me
in the first place.

34:59.223 --> 35:00.756
I don't understand.

35:00.792 --> 35:02.525
Rachel, I know people.

35:02.560 --> 35:04.405
I know what makes them tick,
and I need you to pull

35:04.429 --> 35:06.362
another all-nighter
and help me make that asshole

35:06.397 --> 35:07.997
back the hell off.

35:09.167 --> 35:10.399
Okay.

35:14.038 --> 35:15.738
Louis, is this a bad time?

35:15.773 --> 35:17.239
What?

35:17.275 --> 35:19.028
No. What's going on?

35:19.288 --> 35:21.354
Smith and Devane's
trying to get rid of a judge

35:21.390 --> 35:23.657
to overturn a past ruling.

35:23.692 --> 35:26.059
Mike and I are trying to figure
out which case is big enough

35:26.244 --> 35:28.611
to be worth the risk.

35:28.647 --> 35:30.513
Glazer Bank v. Risa Ventures.

35:30.549 --> 35:32.126
You didn't even look
at the rest of the list.

35:32.150 --> 35:33.316
Oh, I didn't need to.

35:33.351 --> 35:35.485
Smith and Devane represent
Pomaville Industries.

35:35.520 --> 35:37.465
They've been wanting to merge
with Condor for two years.

35:37.489 --> 35:39.400
You overturn that precedent--
- Every dickhead on Wall Street

35:39.424 --> 35:41.324
would be swinging
from the chandeliers.

35:41.359 --> 35:42.492
Clear as day.

35:43.595 --> 35:45.995
You really are a maestro
with this stuff, aren't you?

35:46.031 --> 35:47.297
Thanks, Harvey.

35:48.467 --> 35:49.933
Night, Louis.

35:52.003 --> 35:53.436
Harvey, wait.

35:53.472 --> 35:55.638
I, uh...

35:55.674 --> 35:58.475
I could really use your advice
on something personal.

35:58.510 --> 36:02.445
But I know how you feel
about infidelity, and...

36:02.481 --> 36:04.280
Louis, my feelings
about that

36:04.316 --> 36:05.915
have to do with me
and me alone.

36:05.951 --> 36:07.762
I'm not gonna judge you
for making a different choice

36:07.786 --> 36:09.285
than I would.
- I appreciate that.

36:12.190 --> 36:14.524
Because I had an affair
with Sheila.

36:14.559 --> 36:16.793
Somehow things
got out of control,

36:16.828 --> 36:19.829
and found myself in a fight
with her fiancé.

36:19.865 --> 36:21.831
I went after his client,

36:21.867 --> 36:23.833
and I was about
to put him away.

36:25.837 --> 36:28.071
And now Sheila
wants me to tank it.

36:28.106 --> 36:30.907
Well, if you're asking
as managing partner,

36:30.942 --> 36:32.642
I'd say you better
not tank a case

36:32.677 --> 36:34.144
for a woman
you're sleeping with.

36:34.179 --> 36:36.279
I'm not asking you
as managing partner, Harvey.

36:38.116 --> 36:40.683
I'm asking you as my friend.

36:40.719 --> 36:44.487
Then, my friend,

36:44.523 --> 36:47.724
I say sometimes we have
to sacrifice our business

36:47.759 --> 36:49.559
for the people we care about.

36:54.099 --> 36:55.832
Thanks for this.

37:04.096 --> 37:06.831
Let me guess. You got here
early to inform the panel

37:06.866 --> 37:08.444
you're removing yourselves
from the case.

37:08.468 --> 37:11.268
No, we got here early
to inform you that you are.

37:11.304 --> 37:12.937
And once again,
why would I do that?

37:12.972 --> 37:14.872
Because you hired
a shitty defense attorney

37:14.907 --> 37:17.741
for the sole purpose of getting
dirt on an outstanding judge.

37:17.777 --> 37:19.643
Hiring a shitty lawyer
isn't against the law.

37:19.679 --> 37:22.880
No, but doing it so you can
set up a merger factory is.

37:22.915 --> 37:25.583
That's a great theory,
but you have no proof.

37:25.618 --> 37:27.151
Yes, we do.
Right here.

37:27.186 --> 37:29.653
You signed all six of these
companies within the last year.

37:29.689 --> 37:31.088
And we've got
signed affidavits

37:31.124 --> 37:32.857
from each one of them
saying that you

37:32.892 --> 37:35.593
approached them with an offer
to get their mergers through

37:35.628 --> 37:37.161
if they signed with you
in advance.

37:37.196 --> 37:38.896
Wasn't hard once
they realized

37:38.931 --> 37:40.965
this could rise to the level
of a criminal offense.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.267
And conspiracy
to alter judicial rulings

37:43.302 --> 37:45.936
is most definitely
a criminal offense.

37:45.972 --> 37:49.807
Which means if you don't drop
this thing right now,

37:49.842 --> 37:51.108
you'll end up in prison.

37:51.144 --> 37:52.610
It's up to you.

37:52.645 --> 37:54.089
They're gonna be here
in five minutes.

38:01.693 --> 38:04.093
Louis, what the hell is this?

38:04.129 --> 38:05.328
What does it look like?

38:05.363 --> 38:07.597
It looks like you let
this guy off the hook

38:07.632 --> 38:09.810
when you had him by the throat.
- It's a fair deal, Katrina.

38:09.834 --> 38:11.634
Our client's gonna be thrilled

38:11.670 --> 38:13.014
that they get paid
for an issue that they never

38:13.038 --> 38:14.504
even knew existed
in the first place.

38:14.539 --> 38:16.072
We didn't take this on
for the client.

38:16.107 --> 38:18.508
We did this for you.
- Well, then do this for me.

38:18.543 --> 38:20.510
- Louis.
- God damn it, just do it!

38:22.213 --> 38:25.014
Oh.

38:25.050 --> 38:27.517
She asked you to do this,
didn't she?

38:27.552 --> 38:29.485
I can't say no to her,
Katrina.

38:31.623 --> 38:32.822
I just can't.

38:32.857 --> 38:34.691
You're a good man,
Louis Litt.

38:36.928 --> 38:40.530
And someday you will find
someone who appreciates that.

38:57.445 --> 38:58.956
I see you've brought along
a friend this time.

38:58.980 --> 39:00.479
Oh, she's not just my friend.

39:00.515 --> 39:02.214
She's my lawyer.
- Mm, let me guess.

39:02.250 --> 39:03.894
You brought her along
to withdraw your suit

39:03.918 --> 39:04.928
'cause you finally
figured out there's no way

39:04.952 --> 39:06.418
to outsmart a man like me.

39:06.454 --> 39:08.053
No, she finally figured out

39:08.089 --> 39:09.455
what makes a man like you tick.

39:09.490 --> 39:11.323
And what makes you tick
is being able to say

39:11.359 --> 39:13.337
to every woman you meet
that you own the best buildings

39:13.361 --> 39:15.361
in the cities
with the best views.

39:15.396 --> 39:17.229
Mm, because if you
can't say that, then...

39:17.265 --> 39:19.231
people might notice
that you're really just

39:19.267 --> 39:21.066
an insecure little man
who builds buildings

39:21.102 --> 39:23.335
to cover up his weaknesses.

39:24.906 --> 39:26.105
Get out of my office.

39:26.140 --> 39:27.973
Oh, we will, but if we do,

39:28.009 --> 39:29.787
those views that you covet,
they're going away.

39:29.811 --> 39:31.622
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, did you think

39:31.646 --> 39:33.357
I just came here to tell you
I know what makes you tick?

39:33.381 --> 39:35.114
We now control
the air rights

39:35.149 --> 39:37.950
across from six of your
most prominent properties.

39:37.985 --> 39:41.253
So instead of their
unobstructed views of the park,

39:41.289 --> 39:43.722
your top-floor tenants
will now be looking out

39:43.758 --> 39:46.692
at a 40-foot-high
box of tampons.

39:46.727 --> 39:48.060
What do you want?

39:48.095 --> 39:49.929
I think you know
what we want.

39:49.964 --> 39:52.498
- You keep your lease as is.
- Not quite.

39:52.533 --> 39:53.710
We're gonna need you
to reimburse

39:53.734 --> 39:54.745
the cost of the air rights.

39:54.769 --> 39:57.036
And we'll take a 10% haircut
on our lease.

39:57.071 --> 39:58.582
I'd call you a name
right now, but I'm guessing

39:58.606 --> 39:59.817
you'd sue me.
- David, I really don't care

39:59.841 --> 40:00.940
what you call me right now

40:00.975 --> 40:02.975
because, like you said,
this isn't personal.

40:03.010 --> 40:04.109
It's just business.

40:06.442 --> 40:08.109
Here's our amended lease.

40:20.556 --> 40:22.490
Hey, how's it going?

40:22.525 --> 40:26.193
I just stopped by to tell you
that Judge Ralls called.

40:26.229 --> 40:28.296
She wanted to thank me.
- That's great.

40:28.331 --> 40:31.499
Only problem with that is,
she called me five minutes ago

40:31.534 --> 40:34.302
and told me
the exact same thing.

40:35.938 --> 40:38.472
Want to tell me
what you're really doing here?

40:38.508 --> 40:41.075
Why'd you say
that stuff to Donna?

40:41.110 --> 40:42.810
Because I care about her.

40:44.480 --> 40:46.400
I didn't want her to go
through life not knowing.

40:48.117 --> 40:50.284
- What about me?
- What about you?

40:50.320 --> 40:52.486
Did you think what it would
do to my relationship?

40:52.522 --> 40:54.088
I guess I thought
that if you were

40:54.123 --> 40:55.734
that solid with Paula,
it wouldn't matter.

40:55.758 --> 40:57.191
What if I went
to Logan Sanders

40:57.226 --> 40:58.706
and told him to go for it
with Rachel?

41:00.396 --> 41:02.430
Here's the difference.

41:02.465 --> 41:04.410
I would hope that you wouldn't
be rooting for Rachel

41:04.434 --> 41:08.369
to be with him, and you can
get mad at me or not, but...

41:08.404 --> 41:10.171
yeah, I guess maybe
I was rooting

41:10.206 --> 41:11.872
for Donna to be with you.

41:13.843 --> 41:15.309
Fair enough.

41:15.345 --> 41:16.811
I guess the truth is,
right now,

41:16.846 --> 41:18.779
I'm not looking to be
with anyone.

41:27.123 --> 41:28.589
Donna, are you busy?

41:28.624 --> 41:29.802
I was actually
just getting ready

41:29.826 --> 41:30.958
to go home for the night.

41:32.195 --> 41:34.228
I was just wondering
if there's a reason

41:34.263 --> 41:35.896
why I just got a new lease
on my desk

41:35.932 --> 41:37.932
that's 10% less
than our last one.

41:39.102 --> 41:41.736
I just wanted to thank you
for keeping me.

41:43.639 --> 41:45.740
What?
- If I knew it'd make you

41:45.775 --> 41:47.041
do stuff like that,

41:47.076 --> 41:48.843
I'd consider firing you
more often.

41:48.878 --> 41:51.345
Well, then let's just
consider this a one-time thing.

41:55.284 --> 41:57.718
Before you go...

41:57.754 --> 41:59.487
want me to pour us a drink?

41:59.522 --> 42:01.288
What do you say
we shake things up

42:01.324 --> 42:03.257
and make it two?

42:29.565 --> 42:31.565
Sheila, what are you
doing here?

42:31.601 --> 42:33.301
I left Zander.

42:35.438 --> 42:36.671
What?

42:36.706 --> 42:38.839
I realized he's not
the one for me.

42:39.776 --> 42:41.976
- But I thought you loved him.
- I don't.

42:42.011 --> 42:44.845
I love you.

42:44.881 --> 42:47.248
And I may have forgotten it
for a while.

42:47.283 --> 42:51.319
But in these last two weeks,
you've--you've excited me,

42:51.354 --> 42:53.554
you've gone to battle for me,

42:53.589 --> 42:55.890
and then you sacrificed for me.

42:55.925 --> 42:57.658
But what about children?

42:58.661 --> 43:00.294
You think I can't live
without children--

43:00.330 --> 43:02.697
No, I didn't,
but then I thought,

43:02.732 --> 43:04.298
fate brought us together,
Louis.

43:04.334 --> 43:06.133
Why don't we let fate decide

43:06.169 --> 43:08.602
whether or not
we have children?

43:08.638 --> 43:10.604
- I don't understand.
- Louis,

43:10.640 --> 43:13.307
I threw away my diaphragm.

43:17.413 --> 43:18.579
You're pulling the goalie?

43:18.614 --> 43:20.781
Yes, Louis.
I am.

43:22.819 --> 43:24.752
And I don't want
to role-play tonight.

43:24.787 --> 43:30.291
I just want to be Sheila Sazs
and Louis Litt.

43:34.163 --> 43:35.596
Well, come on.

43:38.334 --> 43:39.667
Let's go inside.
