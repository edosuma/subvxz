02:18.706 --> 02:20.841
- LOOK, YOU GUYS
CAN JOKE ALL YOU WANT,

02:20.874 --> 02:22.510
BUT THE WORD ON THE NET
IS THE REASON THEY KILLED HIM

02:22.543 --> 02:23.611
WAS 'CAUSE PEOPLE
THOUGHT HE WAS GAY.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.746
- WELL, AFTER LIVING
WITH GALAXY LAD FOR 30 YEARS,

02:25.779 --> 02:27.448
RUMORS ARE BOUND
TO CIRCULATE.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.950

CAPTAIN ASTRO BECAUSE HE'S GAY,

02:29.983 --> 02:32.320
THAT MAKES HIS DEATH
A HATE CRIME.

A SIT-DOWN DINNER AT ALL.

THE WHOLE THING
WON'T COST US MORE

04:24.064 --> 04:25.799
THAN A COUPLE HUNDRED BUCKS,
TOPS.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.868
- SIT DOWN.
YOU'RE BEING RIDICULOUS.

04:27.901 --> 04:30.037

AND YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S BEING RIDICULOUS,

BUT REMEMBER,

04:42.383 --> 04:44.017
WE ARE STILL LADIES.

- I'M SORRY IF YOU FEEL
THAT ALL I CARE ABOUT IS MONEY,

04:48.088 --> 04:50.991
BUT I DIDN'T GROW UP A SPOILED
LITTLE RICH GIRL LIKE YOU.

04:51.024 --> 04:53.727
- I AM NOT A SPOILED
LITTLE RICH GIRL.

04:53.761 --> 04:55.095
- PLEASE!

04:55.128 --> 04:57.064
YOUR ENTIRE WORLD VIEW
IS BASED ON SANTA

04:57.097 --> 04:58.999
BRINGING YOU EVERYTHING
YOU EVER ASKED FOR.

04:59.032 --> 05:04.472
- HE DIDN'T BRING ME
EVERYTHING I ASKED FOR.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.407
- OH, LIKE HELL HE DIDN'T.

05:09.477 --> 05:11.579
- I NEVER GOT
THAT ROBIN-EGG BLUE

05:11.612 --> 05:13.881
CASHMERE SWEATER
I ALWAYS WANTED.

05:13.914 --> 05:16.550
YOU KNOW, I MERELY THOUGHT
THAT JUST THIS ONCE,

05:16.584 --> 05:19.487
WE COULD BE
A LITTLE EXTRAVAGANT.

05:19.520 --> 05:20.954
BUT OBVIOUSLY,
YOU'D BE HAPPIER

05:20.988 --> 05:22.089
IF WE'D GONE
TO "WEDDINGS FOR LESS".

05:22.122 --> 05:23.424
OR BETTER YET,

05:23.457 --> 05:24.792
NOT EVEN GONE THROUGH
WITH IT AT ALL.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.126
- NO, I NEVER SAID THAT,

05:26.159 --> 05:30.364
BUT IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT,
IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

05:39.106 --> 05:42.576
- [sigh]
MARRIAGE.

05:42.610 --> 05:45.012
STRAIGHT PEOPLE DESERVE IT.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.385

DID YOU LEARN THAT?

06:03.597 --> 06:04.865
[chuckling]

06:04.898 --> 06:07.601
- OH, AT MY AGE,
TECHNIQUE IS EVERYTHING.

06:07.635 --> 06:09.670
- AH, TECHNIQUE.
[chuckles]

06:09.703 --> 06:12.440
I WOULD CALL THAT ART.

[panting]

06:14.642 --> 06:16.610
AH!

06:16.644 --> 06:20.881
THAT WAS THE BEST ORAL SEX...
I HAVE EVER HAD.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.883
- I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU WANT TO GO TO BED

06:22.916 --> 06:24.485
WITH AN OLD GUY LIKE ME

06:24.518 --> 06:26.754
WHEN THERE'S ALL THOSE
BEAUTIFUL YOUNG MEN OUT THERE.

06:26.787 --> 06:28.589
- WELL, FOR ONE THING,

06:28.622 --> 06:30.724
MOST OF THOSE
BEAUTIFUL YOUNG MEN

06:30.758 --> 06:33.727
ARE ONLY INTERESTED
IN THEMSELVES.

06:33.761 --> 06:35.128
AND FOR ANOTHER,

06:35.162 --> 06:37.164
THE SEX IS USUALLY SO FAST
AND IMPERSONAL,

06:37.197 --> 06:40.601
YOU FORGET THAT YOU HAD IT
BY THE TIME YOU GET HOME.

06:40.634 --> 06:43.671
WITH YOU,
IT'S DIFFERENT.

06:51.712 --> 06:53.681
WELL, I GOTTA GO.

06:53.714 --> 06:58.118
I'M SUPPOSED TO MEET THE BOYS

06:58.151 --> 07:00.654
- BABYLON?
- YEAH.

07:00.688 --> 07:02.790
IT'S A GAY DANCE CLUB.

07:02.823 --> 07:05.225
- I'VE BEEN TO A GAY DANCE
CLUB ONCE, I THINK.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.527
- ONCE?

07:06.560 --> 07:07.861

OH, I FELT SO...

07:10.831 --> 07:13.100
AWKWARD,
SO OUT OF PLACE.

07:13.133 --> 07:15.536
I JUST TURNED AROUND
AND I LEFT, HA.

07:15.569 --> 07:17.671
- YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT'S THE ONLY TIME

07:17.705 --> 07:19.640
YOU'VE EVER BEEN
IN A PLACE FULL OF QUEERS?

07:19.673 --> 07:21.675
- WELL, AT THE OPERA,
OF COURSE.

07:21.709 --> 07:24.111
- [slaps thigh]

07:24.144 --> 07:25.679
- WHERE ARE WE GOING?

07:25.713 --> 07:27.014

07:27.047 --> 07:29.082

NO-NO, I'M NOT READY.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.819
- HONEY, OF COURSE
YOU ARE READY.

07:31.852 --> 07:33.020
- NO.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.221
- YOU'VE BEEN READY
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE,

07:34.254 --> 07:36.490
YOU JUST DIDN'T KNOW IT.
- [groaning]

07:36.524 --> 07:38.158
- NOW COME ON!

CHEER UP.

07:59.279 --> 08:00.981
IT'S NOT THE END
OF THE WORLD.

08:01.014 --> 08:03.584
- JUST THE UNIVERSE.
I SHOULD HAVE STAYED AT HOME.

08:03.617 --> 08:05.118
- AND CRIED YOURSELF
TO SLEEP.

08:05.152 --> 08:06.954
- IF I WANTED TO, YES.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.122
AND WHAT FUCKING BUSINESS
IS IT OF YOURS?

08:09.156 --> 08:12.292
- BETTER TO JOIN THE LIVING.

- HAVE A BUMP.

08:14.628 --> 08:15.929
- HAVE A BOY.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.665
- IN CASE YOU'VE FORGOTTEN,
I'M SEEING SOMEONE.

08:17.698 --> 08:18.832
- WHAT'S THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH IT?

08:18.866 --> 08:21.702
- YOU'VE TRAINED HIM WELL.
- WELL, THE KID HAS A POINT.

08:21.735 --> 08:24.271
YOU'RE NOT TYING THE KNOT
LIKE THE MERRY MUNCHERS.

08:24.304 --> 08:26.574
- YOU GUYS AREN'T EVEN
LIVING TOGETHER.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.676
- YEAH, SO TREAT YOURSELF.
- THAT'S YOUR ARRANGEMENT.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.811
- OOH.
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

08:32.813 --> 08:33.981
- TOO TALL.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.650
HIM.
- TOO HAIRY.

08:36.684 --> 08:38.018
- YOU SOUND LIKE GOLDILOCKS.

08:38.051 --> 08:41.589
- HEY, AND THERE'S
THE THREE BEARS.

08:41.622 --> 08:43.223
- BEFORE WE TAKE
ANYONE HOME,

08:43.256 --> 08:44.925
WE BOTH HAVE TO BE
OF COMPLETE AGREEMENT.

08:44.958 --> 08:47.294
- THAT'S WHERE
SO MANY COUPLES GO WRONG.

08:47.327 --> 08:50.931
ONE WANTS THE FLORAL PATTERN,
THE OTHER WANTS STRIPES.

08:50.964 --> 08:53.100
- THERE'S EMMETT.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.002
- WHO'S THAT FOSSIL
BESIDE HIM?

08:55.035 --> 08:56.336
- IT'S THE CRYPT-KEEPER.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.205
- I WOULD THINK HE'D BE
JUST YOUR TYPE.

08:58.238 --> 09:01.742
NOT TOO HAIRY, NOT TOO TALL,
BUT JUST RIGHT.

09:01.775 --> 09:03.110
- HI, GUYS!

09:03.143 --> 09:06.614
I WANT YOU TO MEET
MY NEW FRIEND, GEORGE.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.723

YOU'RE TED, AM I CORRECT?

09:20.794 --> 09:22.930
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- THE ENTREPRENEUR.

09:22.963 --> 09:24.798
FETCH AND I OWE YOU
A DEBT OF GRATITUDE

09:24.832 --> 09:26.667
'CAUSE YOUR WEBSITE
BROUGHT US TOGETHER.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.670
AND LET'S SEE, YOU,
OF COURSE, ARE MICHAEL,

09:29.703 --> 09:32.072
THE DEVOTED FRIEND.

09:32.105 --> 09:34.374
- YOU TOLD HIM THAT?

09:34.407 --> 09:36.610
- AND JUSTIN.

09:36.644 --> 09:38.111
IF I'D HAD YOUR COURAGE
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,

09:38.145 --> 09:41.615
HOW DIFFERENT
MY LIFE WOULD'VE BEEN.

09:41.649 --> 09:42.916
OH, YEAH, BRIAN.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.885
WELL, FROM WHAT EMMETT
TELLS ME,

09:44.918 --> 09:49.222
YEAH, YOU'RE THE LOVE CHILD
OF JAMES DEAN AND AYN RAND.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.924
- GEORGE,
CAN I BUY YOU A DRINK?

09:50.958 --> 09:52.225
- AH.
- WE CAME HERE TO DANCE.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.194
COME ON, GEORGE.
LET'S BOOGIE.

09:54.227 --> 09:56.296
- * WHY DON'T YOU
JUST GET OUT OF HERE *

09:56.329 --> 09:59.299
* AND DON'T COME BACK

09:59.332 --> 10:00.668
*

10:00.701 --> 10:03.837
* HEY,
JUST GET OUT OF HERE *

10:03.871 --> 10:06.707
* AND DON'T COME BACK

10:06.740 --> 10:09.409
- LOOK AT THEM GO.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.845
- WELL, THAT SHOULD HELP
KEEP HIS CHOLESTEROL DOWN.

10:11.879 --> 10:15.182
- YOU THINK
THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOING IT?

10:15.215 --> 10:17.951
- WHY, YOU GOT A PROBLEM
WITH OLDER MEN, KID?

10:17.985 --> 10:20.020
- OH!

10:20.053 --> 10:21.388
IT'S JUST LIKE A DREAM!

10:21.421 --> 10:23.356
CAN'T BELIEVE
WHAT I'VE BEEN MISSING.

10:23.390 --> 10:26.393
- ME EITHER.

10:26.426 --> 10:29.830
- * SAIL AWAY,
GO-BOARD A TRAIN *

10:29.863 --> 10:33.266
* I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU GET ON *

10:33.300 --> 10:37.004
* I JUST KNOW
I WANT YOU GONE *

10:37.037 --> 10:40.708
* SO TAKE A BUS
OR CATCH A PLANE *

10:40.741 --> 10:41.775
* SAIL AWAY

10:41.809 --> 10:44.845
- CHECK OUT THE DIRTY BLONDE
IN THE WIFE-BEATER.

10:44.878 --> 10:46.814
GREAT ASS.

10:46.847 --> 10:49.449
- HOW DO YOU ALWAYS KNOW
WHAT I LIKE?

10:49.482 --> 10:55.155
- YOU OLDER MEN ALWAYS GO
FOR THE SAME TYPE.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.891
I'LL GO GET HIM.

11:10.170 --> 11:13.273
- [panting]

11:25.518 --> 11:30.023
YOU HAVE GREAT TASTE.

11:30.057 --> 11:31.291
- THANKS.

11:31.324 --> 11:34.194
- OH, N-NOT YOU.
H-HIM.

11:34.227 --> 11:36.329
[panting]

11:42.435 --> 11:44.938
- FIRST TIME I SAW HIM,

11:44.972 --> 11:47.274
I WAS TEN YEARS OLD.

11:47.307 --> 11:51.211
I WAS WALKING DOWN AISLE SEVEN
IN FISHER'S DRUG STORE...

11:51.244 --> 11:52.913
AND THERE HE WAS.

11:52.946 --> 11:56.049
"THE ADVENTURES
OF CAPTAIN ASTRO."

11:56.083 --> 11:57.450
I'D NEVER EVEN HEARD
OF HIM.

11:57.484 --> 12:02.790
HE WASN'T FAMOUS
LIKE SPIDER-MAN OR SUPERMAN.

12:02.823 --> 12:06.093
BUT I THINK THAT'S WHAT
ATTRACTED ME, YOU KNOW?

12:06.126 --> 12:07.961
IT WAS LIKE
I HAD DISCOVERED HIM.

12:07.995 --> 12:10.063
- HMM.

12:10.097 --> 12:12.032
OR, UH,
MAYBE IT WAS THE...

12:12.065 --> 12:17.170
GIANT BULGE IN HIS TIGHTS?

12:17.204 --> 12:21.274
- AFTER I PICKED IT UP,
I-I JUST COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN.

12:21.308 --> 12:23.376
THEN MY MA YELLED
OVER THE STORE SPEAKER,

12:23.410 --> 12:25.378
"MICHAEL NOVOTNY,
GET YOUR ASS TO THE CHECKOUT."

12:25.412 --> 12:27.280
SO I STUFFED IT DOWN
THE FRONT OF MY CORDS.

12:27.314 --> 12:30.117
- YOU STOLE CAPTAIN ASTRO?

12:30.150 --> 12:32.485
- THERE WASN'T ANY EXTRA MONEY
FOR COMICS.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.354
SOON AS I GOT HOME,
I RAN UP TO MY ROOM

12:34.387 --> 12:35.989
AND I FINISHED IT.

12:36.023 --> 12:37.825
IT WAS ALL ABOUT, UH,

12:37.858 --> 12:39.793
HOW MORPHISTO WAS TEMPTING
CADET ASTRO--

12:39.827 --> 12:41.194
HE WASN'T A CAPTAIN YET--

12:41.228 --> 12:43.096
WITH THE ANSWERS
TO THE OFFICER'S EXAM

12:43.130 --> 12:45.265
AT THE INTER-GALACTIC
ACADEMY.

12:45.298 --> 12:49.569
ASTRO WOULD NEVER LIE
OR CHEAT OR STEAL.

12:49.602 --> 12:52.539
WELL, AS SOON AS I
READ THAT I...

12:52.572 --> 12:54.007
I HOPPED BACK ON MY BIKE

12:54.041 --> 12:56.877
AND I RODE BACK
TO FISHER'S DRUG STORE AND...

12:56.910 --> 12:59.346
I TOLD MR. FISHER
THAT I HAD SWIPED IT.

12:59.379 --> 13:01.849
I WAS SURE HE WAS GOING
TO CALL THE COPS.

13:01.882 --> 13:03.216
[laughs]

13:03.250 --> 13:05.185
BUT INSTEAD,
HE REACHED INTO HIS POCKET

13:05.218 --> 13:08.255
AND HE PULLED OUT
TWO QUARTERS...

13:08.288 --> 13:10.323
AND HE PUT THEM
INTO THE CASH REGISTER

13:10.357 --> 13:14.561
AND HE HANDED ME BACK
THE COMIC.

13:14.594 --> 13:17.030
AND HE SAID
THAT I SHOULD GO HOME,

13:17.064 --> 13:20.467
MY MOM WAS PROBABLY
WORRIED ABOUT ME.

13:25.005 --> 13:30.310
- YOU'RE A GOOD MAN,
MICHAEL NOVOTNY.

13:30.343 --> 13:34.381
EVEN IF YOU ARE
A PETTY CROOK.

13:46.126 --> 13:49.096
- WHERE'S MINE?

13:51.965 --> 13:54.134
- COULD I HAVE THE ARTS
AND LEISURE SECTION?

13:54.167 --> 13:55.969
- I'M READING IT.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.604
- IN THE SIX YEARS
I'VE KNOWN YOU,

13:57.637 --> 13:59.139
YOU'VE NEVER READ
THE ARTS AND LEISURE SECTION.

13:59.172 --> 14:02.109
- WELL,
I'M READING IT TODAY.

14:02.142 --> 14:05.378
[phone ringing]

14:18.158 --> 14:20.961
YELLO?

14:20.994 --> 14:24.197
HANG ON.
IT'S FOR YOU.

14:28.335 --> 14:30.537
- HELLO?

14:30.570 --> 14:32.539
HI, MOM.
DID YOU GET MY MESSAGE?

14:32.572 --> 14:35.542
THAT'S GOOD.

14:37.377 --> 14:40.880
BUT SHE LEFT IT TO ME.
SHE WANTED ME TO WEAR IT.

14:44.117 --> 14:47.554
[clears throat]

14:47.587 --> 14:50.557
WELL, IT'S REAL TO ME, MOM.

14:52.325 --> 14:55.495
AND IT'S NOT YOUR PLACE
TO REFUSE, MOTHER.

14:55.528 --> 14:56.997
[phone beeps]

14:57.030 --> 14:58.531
[slams phone]

14:58.565 --> 15:02.369
- NOW WHAT?

15:02.402 --> 15:05.005
- SHE WON'T LET ME HAVE
MY GRANNY FAYE'S WEDDING DRESS.

15:05.038 --> 15:06.306
- WHAT?

15:06.339 --> 15:07.440
- SHE SAID
IF GRANNY FAYE KNEW

15:07.474 --> 15:10.143
A LESBIAN WAS GETTING MARRIED
IN HER DRESS, SHE'D DIE.

15:10.177 --> 15:13.380
- I THOUGHT SHE ALREADY DID.

15:15.148 --> 15:18.618
- [clears throat]

15:18.651 --> 15:21.154
- HONEY.

15:21.188 --> 15:22.555
- IT MEANT A LOT TO ME

15:22.589 --> 15:25.058
TO GET MARRIED IN HER DRESS.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.666
- I KNOW, BABY.
I KNOW.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.421
- HOLY SHIT!

16:07.234 --> 16:10.503
UH...

16:15.508 --> 16:18.645
[mixed chatter]

16:22.649 --> 16:25.185
- NO WALLET, NO I.D.

16:25.218 --> 16:26.319
- YOU SEARCH THE DUMPSTER?

16:26.353 --> 16:29.222
- YEAH, AND THE ALLEY
ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE CORNER.

16:29.256 --> 16:31.358
NOTHING.

16:31.391 --> 16:34.561
- SEARCH IT AGAIN.

16:34.594 --> 16:37.764
YOU MIND IF I ASK YOU A COUPLE
OF QUESTIONS, UH, DEBBIE?

16:37.797 --> 16:41.201
- NOT IF YOU DON'T MIND ME
ASKING YOU ONE FIRST.

16:41.234 --> 16:43.503
WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED?

16:43.536 --> 16:45.572
- LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY
STRANGLED THE VICTIM

16:45.605 --> 16:47.240
AND TOSSED HIM IN THE TRASH.

16:47.274 --> 16:49.109
WHAT TIME DID YOU SAY
YOU FOUND HIM?

16:49.142 --> 16:50.643
- 15, 20 MINUTES AGO.

16:50.677 --> 16:53.513
UH, WHEN I CALLED YOU.

16:53.546 --> 16:55.382
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK
HE'S BEEN IN THERE?

16:55.415 --> 16:57.650
- SIX, SEVEN HOURS
FROM THE LOOK OF IT.

16:57.684 --> 17:00.387
YOU EVER SEEN HIM BEFORE?

17:00.420 --> 17:02.589
- YEAH, I SEEN HIM.

17:08.795 --> 17:10.730
SUNSHINE, DON'T LOOK.

17:10.763 --> 17:11.731
- SUNSHINE?

17:11.764 --> 17:14.467
- YEAH.

17:14.501 --> 17:17.404
THAT'S WHAT I CALL HIM.

17:17.437 --> 17:21.408
WHAT, YOU GOT A PROBLEM
WITH THAT?

17:21.441 --> 17:23.676
HOW ABOUT HIM,
HAS HE GOT A NAME?

17:23.710 --> 17:25.812
- SPANISH OMELET.

17:25.845 --> 17:27.414
- WHAT?

17:27.447 --> 17:33.286
- EXTRA CRISPY HOME FRIES,
WHOLE WHEAT TOAST.

17:33.320 --> 17:34.721
I ONLY KNEW HIM
BY HIS ORDER.

17:34.754 --> 17:37.557
- HEY, YOU GOT A NAME,
DETECTIVE?

17:37.590 --> 17:42.395
- LOOKS LIKE WE GOT
A JANE DOE.

17:42.429 --> 17:44.597
- WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

17:44.631 --> 17:46.466
- AH, COP TALK.

17:46.499 --> 17:48.868
- OH.

17:48.901 --> 17:52.172
YOU KNOW, JUST BECAUSE YOU
FOUND A BODY ON LIBERTY AVENUE

17:52.205 --> 17:54.174
DOESN'T GIVE YOU THE RIGHT
TO MAKE FAG JOKES.

17:54.207 --> 17:57.277
THE BOY IN THE TRASH
WAS SOMEBODY'S SON.

17:57.310 --> 17:58.845
- YEAH.

17:58.878 --> 18:01.181
I'M SURE HE MADE
HIS MOTHER PROUD.

18:01.214 --> 18:04.851
- WELL, I AM THE PROUD MOTHER
OF A GAY SON,

18:04.884 --> 18:08.255
AND YOU ARE
A HOMOPHOBIC PRICK.

18:08.288 --> 18:10.290
- THE NAME'S HORVATH.

18:10.323 --> 18:12.392
H-O-R-V-A-T-H.

18:12.425 --> 18:13.593
FILE A COMPLAINT.

18:13.626 --> 18:16.129
- MA, ARE YOU OKAY?

18:16.163 --> 18:18.265
- THIS IS MY GAY SON,
MICHAEL.

18:18.298 --> 18:19.832
I WAS JUST TELLING
THIS NICE OFFICER

18:19.866 --> 18:23.770
ALL ABOUT YOU, HONEY.

18:23.803 --> 18:27.507
- OH, AN ACCIDENT?

18:27.540 --> 18:29.476
- JESUS, WHAT HAPPENED?

18:29.509 --> 18:31.178
- OH, MY GOD, IS HE DEAD?

18:31.211 --> 18:33.213
- WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU SERVE HIM, DEB?

18:33.246 --> 18:35.215
- ANY OF YOU KNOW THIS GUY?

18:35.248 --> 18:37.350
- I DO.

18:37.384 --> 18:38.885
I DANCED WITH HIM ONCE
AT BABYLON.

18:38.918 --> 18:42.722
- I DON'T SUPPOSE
YOU GOT HIS NAME.

18:44.757 --> 18:47.360
- WELL, I'M STARVED.
LET'S EAT.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.499
DID YOU SEE
WHAT HE WAS WEARING?

18:52.532 --> 18:54.334
- LEATHER PANTS, TANK TOP.

18:54.367 --> 18:55.835
- YEAH, MY THEORY IS
WHOEVER KILLED HIM

18:55.868 --> 19:00.207
WAS MAKING A FASHION
STATEMENT.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.808
- I THINK IT WAS A--
A CRIME OF PASSION.

19:01.841 --> 19:04.611
YOU KNOW, HIS BOYFRIEND
DISCOVERED THAT...

19:04.644 --> 19:06.546
HE WAS BEING UNFAITHFUL,
SO HE, UH...

19:06.579 --> 19:08.348
SENT HIM A NOTE

19:08.381 --> 19:10.783
SAYING, UH, "MEET ME TONIGHT"
AT SOME SECRET SPOT.

19:10.817 --> 19:11.784
THINKING IT WAS...

19:11.818 --> 19:14.521
FROM HIS LOVER, HE GOES,
BUT WHEN HE GETS THERE,

19:14.554 --> 19:16.323
HIS BOYFRIEND
STEPS OUT OF THE SHADOWS,

19:16.356 --> 19:17.524
STRANGLES HIM.

19:17.557 --> 19:19.792
- I THINK YOU'VE SEEN
TOO MANY OPERAS.

19:19.826 --> 19:20.827
- [laughing]

19:20.860 --> 19:22.262
- OH, UH,
I'M GOING TONIGHT.

19:22.295 --> 19:23.530
UH...BIG GALA.

19:23.563 --> 19:25.732
I HAVE AN EXTRA TICKET,
IF YOU WANT TO GO.

19:25.765 --> 19:27.400
- I'D RATHER END UP
IN A DUMPSTER.

19:27.434 --> 19:28.968
- SO, WHOEVER THIS, UH,

19:29.001 --> 19:31.538
DEMENTED ABERRATION
OF HUMANITY WAS

19:31.571 --> 19:34.307
WHO, UH, WHO KILLED HIM,

19:34.341 --> 19:36.243
DO YOU THINK
THEY HAD SEX FIRST?

19:36.276 --> 19:37.444
- HOPE SO.

19:37.477 --> 19:39.279
IT'S ALWAYS BETTER
TO COME BEFORE YOU GO.

19:39.312 --> 19:40.580
[all chuckling]

19:40.613 --> 19:42.415
- BRIAN.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.356
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

19:49.389 --> 19:52.292
- THAT'S MY QUESTION.

19:52.325 --> 19:53.626
- JUST SIGN RIGHT THERE.

19:53.660 --> 19:55.328
WE'RE GOING TO SHOW THEM
THAT EVERY LIFE IS VALUABLE,

19:55.362 --> 19:56.296
GAY OR STRAIGHT.

19:56.329 --> 19:58.798
- WELL, THANK GOODNESS
SOMEBODY AROUND HERE

19:58.831 --> 20:00.567
IS TAKING WHAT HAPPENED
SERIOUSLY.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.569
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU,
SWEETHEART.

20:02.602 --> 20:03.603
- THANKS, MA.
YOU WANT TO SIGN?

20:03.636 --> 20:04.671
- DAMN RIGHT I WILL.

20:04.704 --> 20:05.772
GIVE ME THAT PEN.

20:05.805 --> 20:10.710
NEVER MIND,
I GOT MY OWN.

20:10.743 --> 20:13.646
"BRING BACK CAPTAIN ASTRO"?
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?

20:13.680 --> 20:15.782
- IT'S A PETITION TO THE
PUBLISHERS TO BRING HIM BACK.

20:15.815 --> 20:18.818
- WHAT IS THE MATTER
WITH ALL OF YOU?

20:18.851 --> 20:20.987
A BOY WAS FOUND
OUTSIDE DEAD,

20:21.020 --> 20:23.656
STUFFED IN THE GARBAGE

20:23.690 --> 20:25.658
L-LIKE YESTERDAY'S
MASHED POTATOES,

20:25.692 --> 20:28.695
AND YOU'RE ALL
MAKING A JOKE OUT OF IT?

20:28.728 --> 20:31.731
IS THAT HOW LITTLE
Y-YOU THINK ABOUT HIS LIFE?

20:31.764 --> 20:36.303
HOW LITTLE YOU THINK
ABOUT YOUR OWN?

20:36.336 --> 20:40.773
I EXPECTED MORE FROM YOU
THAN THAT.

20:40.807 --> 20:44.944
A LOT MORE.

20:44.977 --> 20:48.315
ESPECIALLY FROM YOU.

20:48.348 --> 20:49.882
I MEAN, YOU CARE MORE
ABOUT, WHAT A--

20:49.916 --> 20:54.587
A CHARACTER OUT OF A COMIC BOOK
THAN A HUMAN BEING.

21:08.468 --> 21:09.602
- YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE IT.

21:09.636 --> 21:11.338
IT'S STRAPLESS AND TIGHT
AROUND THE WAIST,

21:11.371 --> 21:12.905
WITH SILK BUTTONS
RUNNING DOWN THE BACK

21:12.939 --> 21:16.776
AND SMALL FLOWER APPLIQUE
AT THE HEM.

21:16.809 --> 21:18.311
WHAT?

21:18.345 --> 21:19.812
- I CAN JUST SEE YOU
DESCRIBING YOUR DRESS

21:19.846 --> 21:21.781
WHILE WE'RE BEING ARRAIGNED
FOR BREAKING AND ENTERING.

21:21.814 --> 21:23.383
- I HAVE A KEY

21:23.416 --> 21:24.884
LOOK, LET'S JUST FIND IT
AND GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE

21:24.917 --> 21:26.386
BEFORE YOUR PARENTS
COME HOME.

21:26.419 --> 21:28.921
- I REMEMBER IT'S IN
AN OLD, WOODEN TRUNK.

21:28.955 --> 21:30.457
- THE ONE YOUR ANCESTORS HAD

21:30.490 --> 21:31.724
WHEN THEY LANDED
ON PLYMOUTH ROCK?

21:31.758 --> 21:35.595
- WELL, GRANNY FAYE'S FAMILY
DID COME OVER ON THE MAYFLOWER.

21:35.628 --> 21:38.531
- IN MY FAMILY,
MAYFLOWER'S A MOVING VAN.

21:38.565 --> 21:39.666
- OOH.

21:39.699 --> 21:42.602
LOOKY WHAT I FOUND.
- THAT'S IT!

21:52.979 --> 21:55.014
- IT'S GONE, VANISHED.

21:55.047 --> 21:58.084
- ANY CHANCE GRANNY FAYE
IS RELATED TO HOUDINI?

21:58.117 --> 21:59.686
- WELL, SHE USED
TO SHOW ME THAT DRESS

21:59.719 --> 22:00.953
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL,

22:00.987 --> 22:02.822
AND SHE ALWAYS PUT IT
BACK IN HERE.

22:02.855 --> 22:04.957
- ALL THAT'S LEFT
IS THIS PILE OF PAPERS

22:04.991 --> 22:08.795
AND LINENS,
AND THESE LETTERS.

ALL OF THEM.

WE BUY THREE CANS OF ALPO

25:44.644 --> 25:48.581
AND GO TOGETHER?

25:48.615 --> 25:51.050

IF SOMEBODY WERE TRYING
TO STOP ME

25:59.191 --> 26:03.062
FROM DOING SOMETHING
I LOVE.

26:03.095 --> 26:06.232
- FUCK 'EM ALL?

- YOU GOT IT, BABY.

26:18.377 --> 26:21.047

26:26.085 --> 26:29.388
- HE WAS A GOOD MAN,

26:29.421 --> 26:32.124
A LOVING MAN.

26:32.158 --> 26:34.260
EVERYONE WHO KNEW HIM
WAS MOVED BY HIS KINDNESS

26:34.293 --> 26:38.197
AND HIS GENEROSITY.

26:38.230 --> 26:40.867
- WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU DOING?

26:40.900 --> 26:43.102
- I'M DELIVERING A EULOGY.

26:43.135 --> 26:44.671

THE PRIEST DELIVERED

26:44.704 --> 26:46.272
AT MY FATHER'S FUNERAL.

26:46.305 --> 26:49.141
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT CAPTAIN ASTRO?

26:49.175 --> 26:51.143
- AS MUCH AS THE PRIEST
KNEW ABOUT HIM.

26:51.177 --> 26:56.082
- WELL, THEN, YOU REALLY HAVE
NO RIGHT TO SPEAK, DO YOU?

27:09.896 --> 27:11.263
DO YOU THINK IT'S TRUE?

27:11.297 --> 27:13.065
- IS WHAT TRUE?

27:13.099 --> 27:16.869
- WHAT MY MOM SAID.

27:16.903 --> 27:19.672
- SHE KNEW YOU WERE QUEER
WHEN YOU WERE FIVE YEARS OLD?

27:19.706 --> 27:21.708
- THAT I CARE MORE ABOUT
A CHARACTER IN A COMIC BOOK

27:21.741 --> 27:23.342
THAN I DO
ABOUT A REAL PERSON.

27:23.375 --> 27:24.877
- SO WHAT IF YOU DO?

27:24.911 --> 27:26.078
- WELL, SOME MIGHT SAY

27:26.112 --> 27:28.748
MY PRIORITIES
ARE SLIGHTLY FUCKED UP.

27:28.781 --> 27:33.285
- YEAH.

27:33.319 --> 27:36.022
"SOME" DON'T KNOW SHIT.

27:36.055 --> 27:38.024
I MEAN, YOU'VE KNOWN THE CAPTAIN
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE,

27:38.057 --> 27:41.027
YOU NEVER LAID EYES ON
DUMPSTER BOY UNTIL THIS MORNING.

27:41.060 --> 27:44.831
SO, HOW UPSET ARE YOU
SUPPOSED TO GET?

27:48.768 --> 27:50.903
YOU REMEMBER THAT RETARDED
CAPTAIN ASTRO CLUB

27:50.937 --> 27:53.072
YOU STARTED
IN THE EIGHTH GRADE?

27:53.105 --> 27:55.775
- YEAH, YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE
WHO JOINED.

27:55.808 --> 28:00.913
- I FELT SORRY FOR YOU.
- THANKS.

28:00.947 --> 28:02.114
- THOSE LAME-ASS T-SHIRTS

28:02.148 --> 28:04.450
WITH THE CAPTAIN ASTRO LOGO
YOU MADE WITH MAGIC MARKER.

28:04.483 --> 28:06.753
- THAT RAN WHEN WE SWEATED.

28:06.786 --> 28:08.020
- YEAH.

28:08.054 --> 28:09.956
I COULDN'T GET THE INK OFF
FOR DAYS.

28:09.989 --> 28:11.423
PRACTICALLY
RUBBED MYSELF RAW.

28:11.457 --> 28:14.026
THAT WAS PATHETIC.

28:14.060 --> 28:17.730
- YEAH.
[laughing]

28:17.764 --> 28:20.867
- WELL, THAT
WAS YOUR YOUTH, MIKEY.

28:20.900 --> 28:25.838
CAPTAIN ASTRO
WAS YOUR HERO.

28:25.872 --> 28:30.810
SO YOU MOURN
ALL YOU FUCKING WANT.

IT'S WHAT WOMEN HAD TO DO.

29:54.927 --> 29:58.197
THEY HAD NO CHOICE.

STRAIGHT.

THE NOBLE EGYPTIAN WARRIOR...

30:15.948 --> 30:18.450
HE RUNS OFF WITH AIDA,
THE SLAVE GIRL,

30:18.484 --> 30:20.452
WHO HAPPENS TO WEIGH,
LIKE, 200 POUNDS.

30:20.486 --> 30:21.587
- [chuckles]

30:21.620 --> 30:22.889
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO NOTICE THAT.

30:22.922 --> 30:25.057
- HOW COULD I NOT NOTICE?

30:25.091 --> 30:26.893
HER NAME SHOULD
BE "AIDA-LOT."

30:26.926 --> 30:30.329
- WELL, THE POINT OF THE STORY
IS THAT PASSION TRANSCENDS

30:30.362 --> 30:32.398
ALL THE REWARDS
OF THE MATERIAL WORLD.

30:32.431 --> 30:34.633
- WELL, THEN HE SHOULD GET
SOME CORRECTIVE EYE SURGERY

ACTUALLY.

30:43.242 --> 30:44.443
[mixed chatter]

30:44.476 --> 30:48.147
DID IT MYSELF.
- CHAMPAGNE, SIR?

30:49.916 --> 30:52.051
- NO, I THINK
IT'S QUITE TASTEFUL.

30:52.084 --> 30:55.221
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

30:55.254 --> 30:56.422
- HI, TEDDY!

GEORGE GOT IT FOR ME.

31:05.231 --> 31:06.899
- I FEEL LIKE, UH...
- A MILLION BUCKS.

31:06.933 --> 31:07.967

31:08.000 --> 31:09.501
- I THINK YOU LOOK
VERY HANDSOME.

31:09.535 --> 31:11.103
AS DO YOU, TED.

31:11.137 --> 31:14.073
- OH, THANK YOU, GEORGE.

- AIN'T HE A CHARMER?

31:15.041 --> 31:17.309
- SO, ENJOYING THE PRODUCTION?
- MM-HMM.

31:17.343 --> 31:19.111
WELL, I'M GLAD
I BROUGHT THESE.

31:19.145 --> 31:20.246
FROM WHERE I'M SITTING,

31:20.279 --> 31:21.480
IT LOOKS LIKE
A SINGING FLEA CIRCUS.

31:21.513 --> 31:23.415
- OH, THAT'S A SHAME.

31:23.449 --> 31:25.084
WE'RE IN THE FOUNDER'S BOX.

31:25.117 --> 31:29.521
BUT THEN, IT IS, UH,
SCHICKEL HALL.

31:29.555 --> 31:31.290
- PERHAPS YOU'D CARE TO JOIN US
FOR A GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE.

32:16.002 --> 32:17.203
- THAT'S RIGHT.

32:17.236 --> 32:20.472
- I'VE PACKED AWAY
A LOT OF YOUR PORK.

POODLE GROOMER?

32:43.095 --> 32:45.164
- ACTUALLY,
WE MET ON THE INTERNET.

32:45.197 --> 32:46.332
I, UH...

32:46.365 --> 32:48.267
I WHACK OFF ON, UH,
ON HIS WEBSITE.

32:48.300 --> 32:49.335
- [stammering]

32:49.368 --> 32:51.303
THIS CHAMPAGNE IS--
IS DELIGHTFUL.

32:51.337 --> 32:53.405
- I'M THE DEMON DICK
OF DOT-COM.

32:53.439 --> 32:55.607
- HOW FASCINATING.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.709
HE MUST PAY YOU
QUITE HANDSOMELY.

32:57.743 --> 32:59.311
- OH, NO.
NO, NO.

32:59.345 --> 33:01.047
NO, HE DOESN'T PAY ME
AT ALL.

33:01.080 --> 33:02.314
I WOULDN'T TAKE IT
IF HE DID.

33:02.348 --> 33:05.184
THE REASON I'M WITH GEORGE

33:05.217 --> 33:08.387
IS HE GIVES
SPECTACULAR HEAD,

33:08.420 --> 33:11.157
A SKILL I'M CERTAIN
HE DIDN'T LEARN FROM YOU.

33:11.190 --> 33:13.625
- [gasps]

33:13.659 --> 33:16.062
- MMM.

33:16.095 --> 33:17.229
CURTAIN'S GOING UP.

33:17.263 --> 33:21.167
COME ON, GEORGE, WE DON'T
WANT TO MISS THE SECOND ACT.

33:28.507 --> 33:32.244
- HOW ABOUT THAT VERDI, HUH?

33:33.412 --> 33:35.747
- DO YOU THINK HE KNEW
WHO KILLED HIM?

33:35.781 --> 33:39.218
- WHO?

33:39.251 --> 33:43.122
HOW THE FUCK DO I KNOW?

33:43.155 --> 33:45.824
- MAYBE WE KNOW HIM.

33:45.857 --> 33:48.527
MAYBE WE FUCKED HIM.

33:48.560 --> 33:51.797
- THAT'D BE HOT.

33:51.830 --> 33:54.700
- LIKE THAT GUY
THE OTHER NIGHT.

33:54.733 --> 33:56.368
WE DIDN'T KNOW HIM.

33:56.402 --> 33:59.505
WE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT HIM.

33:59.538 --> 34:01.673
HE COULD HAVE DONE
ANYTHING TO US.

34:01.707 --> 34:03.275
- THE FIRST TIME
YOU CAME HERE,

34:03.309 --> 34:05.511
YOU DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT ME.

34:05.544 --> 34:07.813
I COULD HAVE DONE
ANYTHING TO YOU.

34:07.846 --> 34:11.783
- MM, I WAS PRETTY SURE
YOU WERE GONNA FUCK ME.

34:15.554 --> 34:17.556
- THEN WHAT?

34:23.329 --> 34:25.831
WHAT IF--

34:25.864 --> 34:27.833
- [gasps]

34:35.374 --> 34:37.809
WHAT IF...

34:37.843 --> 34:39.578
I'D STARTED
TO STRANGLE YOU?

34:39.611 --> 34:40.779
- [panting]

34:40.812 --> 34:45.684
I'D RATHER YOU CHOKE ME
WITH YOUR DICK.

34:45.717 --> 34:47.286
- YOU COULD HAVE BEEN DEAD.

34:47.319 --> 34:49.488
- BRIAN...

34:49.521 --> 34:54.193
CUT IT OUT.

34:55.627 --> 34:57.396
- YOU CAME HERE NOT KNOWING
WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

34:57.429 --> 35:00.232
THAT WAS PART OF THE THRILL.

35:03.569 --> 35:06.338
THAT'S WHAT MADE YOU HARD.

35:09.341 --> 35:14.213
YOU'RE HARD NOW
JUST THINKING ABOUT IT.

35:14.246 --> 35:17.416
THE DANGER.

35:17.449 --> 35:20.352
THE EXCITEMENT.

35:23.789 --> 35:26.225
- FUCK ME.

35:26.258 --> 35:28.627
- COME ON,
DON'T BE SO UPSET.

35:28.660 --> 35:30.629
SEE, EVEN THOUGH
AIDA AND RADAMES

35:30.662 --> 35:32.464
ARE SEALED IN A TOMB,

35:32.498 --> 35:35.401
THEIR LOVE WILL LIVE ON
FOR ALL ETERNITY.

35:35.434 --> 35:38.404
- OH, WHO CARES ABOUT THEM?

35:38.437 --> 35:40.506
IT'S YOU.
- ME?

35:40.539 --> 35:43.909
- I SHOULD NEVER HAVE TALKED
TO YOUR WIFE THAT WAY.

35:43.942 --> 35:45.277
[sigh]

35:45.311 --> 35:48.480
I DIDN'T MEAN TO BE
SUCH A NASTY QUEEN.

35:48.514 --> 35:51.650
NOW, YOUR FATE'S SEALED TOO.

35:51.683 --> 35:53.952
THANKS TO ME, YOU'LL
BE BANISHED FROM THE OPERA

35:53.985 --> 35:55.287
FOR ALL ETERNITY.

35:55.321 --> 35:56.955
- THANKS TO YOU,
I PLAN TO ATTEND

35:56.988 --> 35:58.957
EVERY OPENING THIS SEASON.

35:58.990 --> 36:03.562
AND HOPEFULLY WITH MY
HUNKY SLAVE BOY ON MY ARM.

36:03.595 --> 36:05.431
- YOU'RE NOT ANGRY?
- ANGRY?

36:05.464 --> 36:08.934
I HAD THE BEST FUCKING LAUGH
OF MY ENTIRE LIFE.

36:08.967 --> 36:11.603
I NEVER SAW VIRGINIA
OPEN HER MOUTH THAT WIDE.

36:11.637 --> 36:13.405
[chuckling]
I MEAN...

36:13.439 --> 36:15.341
WHO KNOWS, MAYBE IF SHE HAD,
WE MIGHT STILL BE TOGETHER.

36:15.374 --> 36:17.509
[laughing]

36:17.543 --> 36:21.480
AW, GOSH,
WHAT A REVELATION YOU ARE.

36:21.513 --> 36:23.249
WHY, IN THE PAST FEW DAYS
ALONE,

36:23.282 --> 36:26.518
I'VE LIVED MORE THAN I HAVE
IN THE PAST FEW...

36:26.552 --> 36:27.953
YEARS.

36:27.986 --> 36:30.522
- SO WHAT'S NEXT
ON THE BILL?

36:30.556 --> 36:31.957
- HMM.

36:31.990 --> 36:34.760
MM, RIGOLETTO.

36:34.793 --> 36:38.564
NOW, THAT IS THE STORY OF THIS
HUNCHBACK DWARF COURT JESTER

36:38.597 --> 36:41.767
WHOSE BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER
IS RAPED BY THE WICKED DUKE.

36:41.800 --> 36:45.637
- UGH, ENOUGH WITH
THE REALITY PROGRAMMING.

36:45.671 --> 36:47.906
CAN'T ANYBODY WRITE
A DECENT DRAMA ANYMORE?

36:47.939 --> 36:49.575
[both chuckling]

36:53.845 --> 36:56.482
- YOU COMING TO BED?

36:56.515 --> 37:00.386
- IN A MINUTE.

37:00.419 --> 37:03.355
THERE'S ONE MORE LETTER.

37:09.695 --> 37:12.498
- IT'S NEVER BEEN OPENED.

37:21.573 --> 37:23.542
[clears throat]

37:23.575 --> 37:25.444
"DEAR FAYE,

37:25.477 --> 37:27.846
"I KNOW IT'S BEEN MANY YEARS
SINCE I'VE WRITTEN YOU.

37:27.879 --> 37:29.348
"HARRY DIED LAST WEEK.

37:29.381 --> 37:31.450
"WE WERE MARRIED
FOR ALMOST 50 YEARS.

37:31.483 --> 37:34.620
"IT WAS A GOOD MARRIAGE.
WE SHARED MANY THINGS.

37:34.653 --> 37:37.356
"BUT AT THE FUNERAL, I KEPT
THINKING HOW DIFFERENT MY LIFE

37:37.389 --> 37:39.325
"WOULD HAVE BEEN IF--

37:39.358 --> 37:40.659
"IF WHAT?

37:40.692 --> 37:43.329
"I HAD THE COURAGE
TO SAY YES,

37:43.362 --> 37:45.331
"TO BE HONEST,

37:45.364 --> 37:48.867
"TO EXPRESS WHAT I TRULY FELT
THE WAY WE DID

37:48.900 --> 37:52.971
"THAT DAY ON THE SHORE
OF LAKEVIEW BEACH.

37:53.004 --> 37:54.906
"I'VE ALWAYS LOVED YOU,
FAYE,

37:54.940 --> 37:56.508
"AND EVEN THOUGH
IT'S BEEN A LIFETIME,

37:56.542 --> 38:00.379
"I WANT YOU TO KNOW
I STILL DO.

38:00.412 --> 38:04.683
"YOU ALWAYS WERE AND ALWAYS
WILL BE MY TRUE LOVE.

38:04.716 --> 38:07.919
VERA."

38:13.825 --> 38:16.595
- IT'S DATED MARCH 10, 1994.

38:16.628 --> 38:17.763
- SO?

38:17.796 --> 38:20.932
- GRANNY FAYE DIED IN 1992.

38:20.966 --> 38:22.934
- SHE NEVER GOT TO READ IT.

38:22.968 --> 38:27.439
- OR KNOW THAT VERA
ALWAYS LOVED HER.

38:29.741 --> 38:32.844
- [clears throat]

38:32.878 --> 38:35.481
YOU KNOW...

38:35.514 --> 38:39.451
I'M SUDDENLY IN THE MOOD
FOR SURF AND TURF.

38:39.485 --> 38:41.553
- YOU ARE?

38:41.587 --> 38:45.056
- I SAY WE GO FOR
THE CORNUCOPIA D'OR.

38:45.090 --> 38:47.593
- IT'S WILDLY EXTRAVAGANT.

38:47.626 --> 38:50.596
IT'LL PROBABLY LAND US
IN THE POOR HOUSE.

38:50.629 --> 38:53.932
- IT'S OUR SPECIAL DAY.

38:53.965 --> 38:56.702
BESIDES,

38:56.735 --> 39:00.005
GRANNY FAYE AND VERA
WOULD HAVE WANTED US TO.

39:05.444 --> 39:08.414
[dance music]

39:08.447 --> 39:11.850
*

39:11.883 --> 39:14.920
- CHECKING OUT THE ACTION?

39:14.953 --> 39:17.055
- EVERYTHING'S THE SAME.

39:17.088 --> 39:18.890
BUSINESS AS USUAL.

39:18.924 --> 39:20.559
- WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?

39:20.592 --> 39:21.860
- THAT THINGS WOULD STOP,
YOU KNOW,

39:21.893 --> 39:24.563
EVEN FOR ONE NIGHT.

39:24.596 --> 39:26.998
THAT THERE'D BE
A PROTEST OR A...

39:27.032 --> 39:29.067
CANDLELIGHT VIGIL
OR SOMETHING.

39:29.100 --> 39:31.069
- THEY DON'T WANT TO THINK
ABOUT IT.

39:31.102 --> 39:34.606
OR ABOUT GAY BASHING
OR AIDS, OR...

39:34.640 --> 39:39.711
ANY OF THE OTHER SHIT
WE ALL HAVE TO LIVE WITH.

39:39.745 --> 39:41.112
CAN'T SAY I BLAME THEM.

39:41.146 --> 39:44.483
- SO WE'RE JUST SUPPOSED
TO GO ON OUR MERRY WAY?

39:44.516 --> 39:46.718
DANCING, DRINKING,
DOING DRUGS

39:46.752 --> 39:49.788
AND GETTING
OUR DICKS SUCKED?

39:49.821 --> 39:52.724
HE DESERVES
TO BE REMEMBERED,

39:52.758 --> 39:57.463
AT LEAST FOR A MINUTE.

39:57.496 --> 40:01.733
- TELL YOU WHAT.

40:01.767 --> 40:04.936
WE'LL HAVE
OUR OWN CANDLELIGHT VIGIL.

40:12.944 --> 40:15.213
- IT'S ALL SO...

40:15.246 --> 40:18.517
- TENTATIVE?

40:18.550 --> 40:21.487
UNPREDICTABLE?

40:21.520 --> 40:23.889
- ANY MOMENT, ANY ONE OF US
COULD PICK UP THE WRONG GUY,

40:23.922 --> 40:25.924
OR GET ON THE WRONG PLANE,

40:25.957 --> 40:27.225
OR STEP OFF THE CURB

40:27.258 --> 40:32.931
JUST AS THE BUS
IS BARRELING DOWN THE STREET.

40:32.964 --> 40:35.601
DO YOU EVER GET SCARED?

40:35.634 --> 40:37.536
- WHY DO YOU THINK
I MEDITATE,

40:37.569 --> 40:42.574
AND DO YOGA,
AND EXERCISE LIKE A FIEND?

40:42.608 --> 40:44.976
IF IT BUYS ME PEACE OF MIND
FOR EVEN 30 SECONDS,

40:45.010 --> 40:48.179
IT'S WORTH IT.

40:48.213 --> 40:50.816
I ALSO FIND
HAVING SOMEONE TO HOLD

40:50.849 --> 40:52.684
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

40:52.718 --> 40:55.921
HELPS A WHOLE HELL OF A LOT.

41:17.876 --> 41:19.978
- HEY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

41:20.011 --> 41:21.012
- UH, TOMMY--

41:21.046 --> 41:22.247
TONY--

41:22.280 --> 41:24.716
TIMMY HERE HAS INVITED ME
OVER TO HIS HOUSE

41:24.750 --> 41:25.984
TO SEE HIS STAMP COLLECTION.

41:26.017 --> 41:28.153
- WHAT, YOU DON'T EVEN
KNOW HIS NAME?

41:28.186 --> 41:30.822
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

41:30.856 --> 41:31.990
- WHAT'S IT TO YOU?

41:32.023 --> 41:34.760
- COME ON.
LET'S GO HOME.

41:34.793 --> 41:36.695
- ARE YOU SCARED
I'M GOING TO GET MURDERED?

41:36.728 --> 41:38.597
- BRIAN, PLEASE.

41:38.630 --> 41:40.866
- THERE'S NEVER BEEN A HOTTER
TIME TO FUCK A STRANGER.

41:40.899 --> 41:43.969
- HEY, WHILE WE'RE YOUNG.

41:46.672 --> 41:51.009
- I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

41:51.042 --> 41:54.613
