WEBVTT

00:07.000 --> 00:09.760
Oh, no, no, no.
Charlie, honey, look.

00:09.770 --> 00:12.770
If you do it one strand
at a time, it's prettier.

00:12.770 --> 00:13.900
See?

00:14.400 --> 00:15.640
Whatever.

00:17.940 --> 00:21.410
Forget it, Mom.
Charlie with tinsel
is like Dad with spaghetti.

00:21.410 --> 00:22.540
"Pretty" just
ain't gonna happen.

00:24.950 --> 00:26.610
Yeah, well, you...

00:29.420 --> 00:30.650
This isn't over.

00:32.420 --> 00:34.860
Bob, honey, listen
I've got a million things
to do this week,

00:34.860 --> 00:36.990
so I need you to take
Charlie to see Santa.

00:36.990 --> 00:38.360
Sure.
What did I just say?

00:39.330 --> 00:40.690
I have no idea.

00:41.860 --> 00:44.430
Honey, I'm trying
to think of a good
comeback for Gabe.

00:45.430 --> 00:48.970
Again, I need you to take
Charlie to see Santa.

00:48.970 --> 00:51.840
And you have got to
find out what present
she wants most.

00:51.840 --> 00:54.110
Okay. Got it.
Charlie, Santa, present.

00:54.110 --> 00:55.810
Three words?
That's all you heard?

00:55.810 --> 00:57.910
Honey, that's two more
than I usually hear.

01:00.150 --> 01:03.380
Guys, guess what?
I just got into NYU!

01:03.390 --> 01:05.450
Hey!
Oh, honey.
That's great.

01:05.790 --> 01:07.620
Hey, congratulations!
How cool.

01:07.920 --> 01:09.520
What are you guys
talking about?

01:09.920 --> 01:13.130
Charlie, honey,
I know this might be sad,

01:13.130 --> 01:15.460
but Teddy's gonna be
going away to college soon.

01:15.460 --> 01:16.960
Can I have your room?

01:18.130 --> 01:21.400
No, honey,
Mommy's turning it
into a recording studio.

01:23.710 --> 01:25.470
Because she's so sad.

01:28.040 --> 01:31.610
So, uh, NYU wants
an answer right away

01:31.610 --> 01:35.620
and how can I
make a decision until I've
actually seen the place?

01:35.620 --> 01:39.050
We can't just
drop everything and
take you to New York.

01:39.050 --> 01:41.520
Yeah. And we're not going to
let you fly across country
by yourself.

01:41.520 --> 01:43.660
Too bad there isn't
another adult
who can go with her.

01:44.130 --> 01:46.390
You're an adult.
I am?

01:46.400 --> 01:47.590
Oh, yeah, I guess I am.

01:49.160 --> 01:51.130
So I can go
if PJ goes with me?

01:51.130 --> 01:53.100
Yeah. I guess
that would be okay.

01:53.100 --> 01:54.940
But your job
is to keep an eye on her.

01:55.400 --> 01:57.870
Oh, and the thing is,
the last campus tour

01:57.870 --> 02:02.840
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
You guys are gonna be
gone on Christmas Eve?

02:02.850 --> 02:04.650
It's okay, we'll be
back for Christmas.

02:05.110 --> 02:08.720
PJ, you'll make us
Christmas Eve dinner
before you go, right?

02:10.050 --> 02:11.890
You'll do that
for us, right?

02:12.550 --> 02:14.550
Gabe, honey,
don't be ridiculous.

02:14.560 --> 02:17.820
Why should he
make it, freeze it,
thaw it, re-heat it,

02:17.830 --> 02:19.190
when I can just make
Christmas Eve dinner?

02:19.890 --> 02:21.460
You'll do that
for us, right?

03:33.270 --> 03:35.040
PJ, where are we going?

03:35.040 --> 03:36.970
I have to be at NYU
in less than an hour.

03:36.970 --> 03:39.170
To one of the most famous
landmarks in the city.

03:39.770 --> 03:40.870
And here we are.

03:43.210 --> 03:44.240
A hot dog cart?

03:44.250 --> 03:46.110
Not just any
hot dog cart.

03:46.120 --> 03:48.020
George's Kraut Dogs.
Oh.

03:48.020 --> 03:50.550
According to
online reviews, this is
the best in all the city.

03:50.550 --> 03:52.890
There was some speculation
about a cart down
in Chinatown,

03:52.890 --> 03:53.950
but that was squashed.

03:53.960 --> 03:57.320
The speculation?
No, the cart.
It got hit by a bus.

04:00.260 --> 04:02.600
Oh, my gosh,
you must be George.

04:02.600 --> 04:05.230
Oh, my gosh,
you must be able to read.

04:07.970 --> 04:09.200
Two kraut dogs, please.

04:09.200 --> 04:10.270
Oh, I don't want
kraut on mine.

04:10.270 --> 04:11.610
Get out!

04:13.110 --> 04:15.240
What?
No kraut, no sale.

04:16.079 --> 04:19.149
You want hot dog,
you go somewhere else.

04:20.720 --> 04:21.880
Okay, that was fun.

04:23.720 --> 04:27.320
So, let's meet up
in, like, three hours.
Where you gonna be?

04:27.790 --> 04:29.560
Right here.
I'm not going anywhere.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.830
PJ, you have one day
in New York City

04:31.830 --> 04:33.630
and you're gonna spend it
at a hot dog cart?

04:33.630 --> 04:35.330
Why would I leave?

04:36.200 --> 04:38.070
Because...

04:39.970 --> 04:41.070
Okay, see ya.

04:42.700 --> 04:45.110
One kraut dog, please,
extra kraut.

04:45.110 --> 04:48.180
No! You get as much kraut
as I put on.

04:48.180 --> 04:50.040
No more, no less.

04:54.720 --> 04:55.850
Oh.

04:56.320 --> 04:58.650
Oh, my. Mmm.

04:58.650 --> 05:01.860
The snap of the casing,
the tang of the kraut.

05:01.860 --> 05:04.590
Oh, you are a genius.

05:04.590 --> 05:07.260
And you are not wrong.
Mmm.

05:14.200 --> 05:16.770
Ho, ho, ho!
And what is your name?

05:16.770 --> 05:18.110
Charlie.

05:18.110 --> 05:20.110
And have you been
a good girl?

05:20.310 --> 05:21.780
Eh.

05:23.280 --> 05:25.250
Your honesty is refreshing.

05:25.750 --> 05:26.150
What would you like
for Christmas?

05:30.150 --> 05:34.290
Oh, that's good.
Okay. Merry Christmas,
Charlie!

05:35.660 --> 05:39.890
Um, okay, so, what did you
ask Santa for?

05:40.260 --> 05:42.230
He knows. He's Santa.
Well...

05:43.130 --> 05:46.830
Um, actually, he's just
one of Santa's helpers.

05:46.840 --> 05:48.840
The real Santa
is up at the North Pole.

05:48.840 --> 05:51.200
So, you can tell me
what you asked for.

05:51.210 --> 05:53.070
It's a secret.

05:54.280 --> 05:58.110
Okay, um, hang on a second.
Stand right here. Okay?

05:59.180 --> 06:01.180
Uh, excuse me, Santa?

06:01.180 --> 06:04.220
Oh, oh, listen, buddy,
there's a weight limit
on this ride.

06:04.690 --> 06:09.120
I'm sorry. I wanted to
talk to the Santa
that was just here.

06:09.120 --> 06:11.190
He'll be back this afternoon.

06:11.190 --> 06:13.790
We like to put on
fresh pants
every couple hours.

06:25.910 --> 06:27.440
It's my first time
on the subway.

06:28.940 --> 06:30.340
And me without a balloon.

06:32.750 --> 06:35.950
There's some of that
New York humor
I've heard so much about.

06:35.950 --> 06:37.280
Uh-huh.

06:40.190 --> 06:41.450
It's my first time
in the city.

06:41.460 --> 06:44.960
Or as you natives call it,
The Big Apple.

06:45.930 --> 06:48.730
So, you don't have
a book or a magazine or...

06:48.730 --> 06:51.970
Actually, could you tell me
what stop I need to
get off at?

06:51.970 --> 06:53.870
I'm trying to get to NYU.

06:54.100 --> 06:56.240
Oh. Here's what you wanna do.

06:56.240 --> 06:58.340
Take this all the way
to the end of the line,

06:58.340 --> 07:01.410
get off, get on another train
going the opposite direction.

07:04.180 --> 07:06.410
More of that trademark
New York humor?

07:07.010 --> 07:08.880
Nope. You're going
the wrong way.

07:13.790 --> 07:17.290
now that I've been
hanging out here for a while,
I have a question.

07:17.290 --> 07:18.960
They are 67% beef.

07:20.090 --> 07:21.260
That wasn't the question.

07:21.260 --> 07:23.330
Oh, good. (SIGHS)
I was fudging the numbers.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.300
You're out here
for hours.
Mmm-hmm.

07:26.300 --> 07:28.070
What do you do
when you have to
go to the bathroom?

07:28.070 --> 07:29.770
Well, I try not to
think about it.

07:29.770 --> 07:32.040
'Cause if I think about it
then I have to go.

07:32.040 --> 07:33.270
And now I'm
thinking about it!

07:35.140 --> 07:36.410
Watch the cart!
I'll be back.

07:40.210 --> 07:43.180
Wow. It's all mine.

07:43.190 --> 07:44.380
Oh, and that's hot!

07:46.350 --> 07:48.990
Uh, one kraut dog,
no kraut.

07:49.190 --> 07:50.460
Skyler?

07:51.390 --> 07:52.760
PJ?

07:53.230 --> 07:54.230
Hi.

07:54.960 --> 07:59.000
Teddy's taking a tour of NYU.
We're just here for the day.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.330
And you got a job?

08:01.500 --> 08:02.900
It's just temporary.

08:02.900 --> 08:04.000
Oh.

08:04.340 --> 08:07.040
So, how are you?
Um, great.

08:07.040 --> 08:10.280
I'm graduating high school,
getting ready to go off
to college.

08:10.880 --> 08:12.980
Wow, good for you.

08:16.020 --> 08:20.250
Well, uh, here's your
kraut dog, no kraut.

08:21.820 --> 08:23.060
Uh, what do I owe you?

08:23.060 --> 08:26.330
It's the least I can do
for my ex-girlfriend.

08:27.130 --> 08:28.190
Thanks.

08:31.270 --> 08:33.570
Well, it was good
seeing you.

08:33.570 --> 08:35.000
Yeah, you, too.

08:35.470 --> 08:37.000
(SIGHS)

08:39.809 --> 08:43.380
Of all the hot dog stands
in all the towns,
in all the world,

08:43.980 --> 08:46.350
she had to walk up
to the one
I'm temporarily working at.

08:55.560 --> 08:58.290
Hey, honey.
How'd it go at the mall?
Fine.

08:58.290 --> 08:59.960
Okay, what went wrong?

09:02.100 --> 09:05.530
I didn't find out
what Charlie wanted
for Christmas.

09:05.530 --> 09:07.570
What?
Well, she whispered it
to Santa

09:07.570 --> 09:09.370
and then
she wouldn't tell me.

09:10.140 --> 09:12.170
Well, did you ever
think about asking Santa?

09:12.170 --> 09:16.380
I tried to, but by then,
Wise Guy Santa had
replaced Fresh Pants Santa.

09:17.580 --> 09:19.480
Honey, it's crazy down there.

09:21.020 --> 09:24.180
Okay, as usual,
I have to handle it myself.

09:24.190 --> 09:27.390
They won't let you
talk to him
unless you got a kid.

09:28.020 --> 09:29.120
Gabe!

09:30.060 --> 09:32.430
What?
Let's go.
You're talking to Santa.

09:33.460 --> 09:35.300
All right.
Let me just shave,
I'll be right with you.

09:45.110 --> 09:46.270
(BRAKES SCREECHING)

09:53.150 --> 09:54.210
Excuse me?

10:00.290 --> 10:02.260
Did you, uh,
did you catch any of that?

10:02.260 --> 10:07.260
(MUMBLING) "We're experiencing
a temporary minor delay,

10:10.300 --> 10:13.170
There is a temporary
minor delay, but we're
gonna be moving shortly.

10:13.170 --> 10:15.270
(SIGHS)
Well, that's good news.

10:15.270 --> 10:17.240
No, it's bad news.

10:21.140 --> 10:22.280
Why?

10:22.280 --> 10:23.940
You're not
from New York, are you?

10:23.950 --> 10:25.350
No. How did you know?

10:25.350 --> 10:27.210
'Cause you don't
speak subway.

10:28.720 --> 10:32.520
"Temporary minor delay" means
"We're not going anywhere
for a long, long time."

10:32.520 --> 10:36.390
"Should be moving shortly"
means "I'm not kidding.
A long, long time."

10:38.260 --> 10:40.460
But if it's not true,
then why would they
say that?

10:40.460 --> 10:42.260
Oh, 'cause he wants
everyone to remain calm.

10:42.260 --> 10:43.530
Well, it's not working!

10:51.240 --> 10:53.610
This is not good.
I need to get to NYU.

10:53.610 --> 10:57.080
This train needs to
start moving, now!

10:57.210 --> 11:01.050
If you click your heels
three times, I'm sure
we'll be on our way.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.220
Hey, I have to get
somewhere, too.

11:04.220 --> 11:05.950
I have a very
important audition.

11:05.950 --> 11:10.160
Yeah, the difference is,
she might actually
get into NYU.

11:11.260 --> 11:13.190
I'm hoping you two
know each other.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.530
Oh. I'm Jessie,
this is Zuri.
I'm her nanny.

11:15.530 --> 11:16.960
I'm Teddy. Hi.

11:17.160 --> 11:18.570
Jessie, I'm hungry.

11:19.030 --> 11:20.670
We'll get you something
to eat after my audition.

11:21.100 --> 11:23.700
So I have to wait
for you to blow
the audition,

11:23.710 --> 11:27.570
then I have to console you,
then I get something to eat?

11:28.180 --> 11:30.110
Yes. Same routine as always.

11:31.650 --> 11:33.310
But I'm hungry now.

11:33.980 --> 11:36.380
(SNIFFS)
And something smells good.

11:38.190 --> 11:39.320
What's that?

11:39.590 --> 11:41.190
Lasagna.

11:41.190 --> 11:43.260
And it's for
a Christmas party
I'm going to.

11:43.260 --> 11:45.560
We could have
a party right now.

11:46.090 --> 11:49.000
Uh, uh, uh! Sit.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.200
Um, listen,
while we're stuck here,

11:52.200 --> 11:54.000
would you mind
running lines with me?

11:54.000 --> 11:57.340
Why not?
Okay, so we're at
a very fancy country club,

11:57.340 --> 11:59.440
and you're having tea
with your friends.

11:59.770 --> 12:01.410
Cue me in.
Okay.

12:02.240 --> 12:04.680
"I've spent all my summers
in Southampton.

12:04.680 --> 12:08.350
"The smell of the beach
always brings me back
to a simpler time.

12:08.350 --> 12:09.480
"Oh, here's the girl now."

12:10.120 --> 12:11.480
More tea?

12:14.360 --> 12:16.690
That's it?
Yeah. It's not
a very big part.

12:17.630 --> 12:19.190
They never are.

12:27.330 --> 12:29.640
Ho, ho, ho!
Who's next?

12:33.270 --> 12:37.180
Okay, let's do this one
standing up.

12:39.150 --> 12:40.650
I think that might be best.

12:41.550 --> 12:44.480
Tell me your name,
little... Man.

12:46.350 --> 12:48.690
Gabe. I want cash.

12:49.660 --> 12:51.160
Next!

12:52.230 --> 12:55.300
Hi, Santa.
Uh, my little girl
was here a few hours ago.

12:55.300 --> 12:58.430
Uh, actually,
that's a picture of you.

12:58.700 --> 13:02.070
Oh, sorry about that.
Let me just get one of her.

13:02.070 --> 13:06.440
That's me.
Me, me, me, me.

13:06.570 --> 13:08.640
Oh, here she is. With me.

13:10.310 --> 13:12.280
Do you remember
what present she wanted?

13:12.280 --> 13:13.350
Yeah. It was a doll.

13:13.350 --> 13:15.320
Are you sure?
Or a pony.

13:15.680 --> 13:17.750
Okay, now I feel like
you're just trying to
get rid of me.

13:17.750 --> 13:19.450
It's always a doll
or a pony.

13:19.450 --> 13:22.260
Once in a while
you get a kitten
or a bike.

13:22.260 --> 13:24.690
Dolls and ponies
those are your mainstays.

13:26.160 --> 13:27.530
I don't care about that!

13:27.530 --> 13:31.860
It's Christmas Eve!
I'm running out of time,
and I've got to know!

13:32.300 --> 13:34.370
Ma'am, you're a little
out of control.

13:34.370 --> 13:36.200
The holidays can do that
to people.

13:36.200 --> 13:37.740
No. It's not just
the holidays.

13:38.340 --> 13:41.370
Okay. So, I want
Christmas to be perfect.
Is that so wrong?

13:41.640 --> 13:44.840
Joe, we got another
holiday stress case.

13:45.850 --> 13:47.880
Is there a problem?
Yes, there's a problem.

13:47.880 --> 13:50.480
It's Christmas Eve
and everything
is falling apart!

13:50.490 --> 13:52.220
I hear what you're saying.

13:52.220 --> 13:54.690
Now, let's go to
Candy Cane Village,

13:54.690 --> 13:57.560
have some nog
and talk about
our feelings.

14:00.390 --> 14:04.300
Okay. Okay.
Yeah, yeah, I think
that might be best.

14:13.740 --> 14:16.510
Hey, George. What?

14:16.510 --> 14:19.180
You sold a dog
with no kraut.

14:19.880 --> 14:21.710
I can see it in your face.

14:21.720 --> 14:24.220
I didn't mean to.
It was for my ex-girlfriend.

14:24.220 --> 14:27.490
No exceptions!
Everybody gets kraut!

14:27.490 --> 14:29.260
Except for
Mr. Billy Joel!

14:29.260 --> 14:31.290
Piano Man gets it
any way he wants.

14:33.330 --> 14:35.830
I'm sorry, when I saw her,
I realized I hadn't really
gotten over her.

14:35.830 --> 14:39.370
And did you tell her this?
No. I choked.

14:39.370 --> 14:41.230
I just let her walk out
of my life again.

14:41.240 --> 14:44.370
Well, PJ, I think
you should find her
and tell her how you feel.

14:44.370 --> 14:46.210
She sounds like
a very special girl.

14:46.340 --> 14:47.840
How am I going to do that?

14:47.840 --> 14:49.510
We're in the middle of
the biggest city
in the world.

14:49.510 --> 14:51.310
There's got to be, like,
10 million people
in the...

14:51.310 --> 14:52.450
Oh, there she is.

14:54.210 --> 14:55.920
Hi, PJ.
Look, I'm really glad
you came back,

14:55.920 --> 14:57.180
'cause I got to
tell you something.

14:58.350 --> 15:01.420
The minute I saw you,
I knew I was
still crazy about you.

15:01.890 --> 15:03.760
That's why I came back, too.

15:03.760 --> 15:06.190
I just finished talking
to the kebab guy
around the corner...

15:06.190 --> 15:08.330
Oh, Ezra?
He's my cousin,

15:08.330 --> 15:09.900
and very wise
in the ways of love.

15:12.530 --> 15:16.800
He helped me realize
that I'm still crazy
about you, too.

15:16.810 --> 15:18.770
Really?
Really.

15:20.310 --> 15:23.210
Now that I have you
back in my life,
I'm never gonna let you go.

15:23.210 --> 15:24.540
Actually, I have to go.

15:25.650 --> 15:28.280
My family and I are
driving to Maine
for Christmas.

15:28.280 --> 15:29.680
So this is it?

15:29.950 --> 15:31.480
I'm afraid so.

15:32.620 --> 15:35.350
I mean, you'll be in Denver,
and I'll be off to college.

15:35.360 --> 15:37.590
Where are you going?
Denver University.

15:40.290 --> 15:41.490
Will you write me?

15:43.400 --> 15:44.830
Oh, every day.

15:44.830 --> 15:46.330
I think I can help.

15:47.870 --> 15:49.840
You're going to school
in Denver?

15:49.840 --> 15:50.870
Yeah.

15:50.870 --> 15:53.270
And you live in Denver.

15:55.410 --> 15:56.810
BOTH: (GASPING) Oh!

16:04.380 --> 16:05.450
Yes, I'll hold.

16:05.890 --> 16:07.350
"More tea?"

16:08.390 --> 16:09.490
"More tea?"

16:11.890 --> 16:16.730
I will trade you
one piece of lasagna
for a ride on a private jet.

16:17.400 --> 16:20.370
That's right,
I can make that happen.

16:22.370 --> 16:24.900
"More tea." See?
Now it sounds like
I'm saying "Morty."

16:25.740 --> 16:29.580
Yes. Hi. Um,
I was supposed to take
the tour today at 2:00.

16:29.580 --> 16:32.350
(PLAYING STEEL DRUM)
But, um, I'm...
I'm stuck in the subway.

16:32.350 --> 16:35.010
So...
(SIGHS) Hold on.

16:35.020 --> 16:38.850
Excuse me, I'm sorry,
but I'm trying to make
an important phone call here.

16:38.850 --> 16:41.390
Yeah, and I'm practicing
my audition.
So keep it down.

16:42.560 --> 16:44.060
Seriously, could you
knock it off?

16:44.060 --> 16:46.730
"More..." Yeah, see!
Now you made me
forget my line!

16:47.630 --> 16:49.300
Oh, come on!
Give me a break!

16:49.300 --> 16:50.560
I'm not gonna
ask you again!
If you hit that...

16:50.570 --> 16:52.300
Everyone, stop it!

16:52.730 --> 16:54.700
Okay, I know
we're all stressed out,

16:54.700 --> 16:57.400
but are you forgetting
it's Christmas Eve?

16:58.470 --> 17:02.410
Christmas is not about
auditions and college tours.

17:02.410 --> 17:05.880
It's about peace on Earth,
good will towards men.

17:07.079 --> 17:09.349
I guess what I'm
trying to say is...

17:09.819 --> 17:11.680
Hand over that lasagna!

17:15.359 --> 17:16.589
Zuri's right.

17:16.589 --> 17:18.560
I'm not
handing over anything!

17:19.630 --> 17:23.329
What are we getting
so upset about?
It's Christmas.

17:23.730 --> 17:27.369
If I don't make it to NYU,
maybe it wasn't meant to be.

17:27.569 --> 17:30.670
Yeah. And maybe me getting
that part wasn't meant to be.

17:30.670 --> 17:32.100
You say that every time.

17:32.110 --> 17:33.740
They don't need to
know that!

17:35.610 --> 17:38.780
As long as we're stuck here,
might as well
make the best of it.

17:38.780 --> 17:41.110
Yeah, maybe
what this car needs is
a little Christmas spirit.

17:42.450 --> 17:44.450
Mr. Steel Drum Man,
if you would.

Charlie! Charlie,
you won't believe it.

18:21.160 --> 18:24.060
A special visitor
just came down
the chimney.

18:25.130 --> 18:29.400
Hello-ho-ho, Charlie.

18:29.630 --> 18:32.400
Santa, what are you
doing here?

18:33.530 --> 18:37.740
Well, I get so many
requests from kids

18:37.740 --> 18:40.810
that sometimes I forget
what they asked for.

18:41.640 --> 18:44.480
I'm not
500 years old anymore.

18:44.650 --> 18:46.910
Ho, ho, ho!

18:47.750 --> 18:51.180
Oh, Santa,
stick to the script.

18:53.150 --> 18:56.720
Why don't you
come over here
and sit on Santa's lap.

18:56.920 --> 18:58.190
No.

19:00.660 --> 19:02.860
Ho, ho! Why not?

19:02.860 --> 19:04.200
Because you're Daddy.

19:05.100 --> 19:08.170
No! No, ho, ho, ho.

19:08.170 --> 19:09.700
I'm Santa.

19:09.700 --> 19:12.170
Then why are you wearing
Daddy's shoes?

19:15.610 --> 19:17.140
Okay, sweetie.
You can go now.

19:20.210 --> 19:23.220
Great! Now what?

19:23.220 --> 19:26.050
Honey, relax.
(SIGHS)

19:26.050 --> 19:27.120
Have some nog.

19:29.460 --> 19:30.860
It's Christmas Eve.

19:30.860 --> 19:32.530
She gets to open
a present tonight,

19:32.530 --> 19:34.660
and we don't know
what she wants!

19:34.660 --> 19:38.130
Honey, take it easy.
It's not worth getting
all upset about.

19:38.930 --> 19:40.670
Who are you?

19:41.970 --> 19:44.770
Joe, the Elf,
he taught me a lot today.

19:46.070 --> 19:49.840
Did you know that
you can't spell "self"
without "elf"?

19:53.510 --> 19:54.950
What does that mean?

19:56.080 --> 19:58.620
I don't know,
but it really
calmed me down.

20:05.860 --> 20:06.960
Hey, PJ.

20:06.960 --> 20:08.490
Hey, how was NYU?

20:09.100 --> 20:12.230
Never made it.
Long story,
I'll tell you later.

20:12.630 --> 20:13.870
So, how was your day?

20:13.870 --> 20:15.600
Well, I ate
a bunch of hot dogs

20:15.600 --> 20:17.040
and I got back together
with Skyler.

20:17.540 --> 20:21.010
Well, after the first four,
I had to take a nap, then...

20:21.010 --> 20:22.840
Skyler.
Oh, right.

20:22.840 --> 20:26.950
If you're going to Denver,
you're not going to Denver.

20:27.250 --> 20:29.120
There's a big blizzard
over the Rockies.

20:29.120 --> 20:30.780
The airport is closed.

20:31.850 --> 20:33.090
Teddy, what are we gonna do?

20:34.150 --> 20:35.920
Wait a minute.
Uh, I met this girl
on the subway

20:35.920 --> 20:37.160
and she gave me
her number.

20:39.790 --> 20:43.260
Hello. Hi, um,
I'm Teddy, who is this?

20:44.300 --> 20:46.130
The butler?

20:47.200 --> 20:49.270
We are so staying there.

20:54.940 --> 20:57.980
Can I open
my special present now?
Yeah, yeah...

20:57.980 --> 21:00.610
Do, uh, do we have
a special present
for Charlie?

21:00.850 --> 21:02.280
The big one!

21:04.320 --> 21:06.990
Oh. Okay.
Okay. Open it.

21:11.090 --> 21:12.160
(GASPS)

21:12.160 --> 21:14.960
A doll house!
I told you Santa knew!

21:16.930 --> 21:19.670
Honey, how did you know
what to get her?

21:19.670 --> 21:21.930
I was going to ask you
the same question.

21:21.940 --> 21:23.570
What? If you
didn't get it...
No.

21:23.570 --> 21:25.600
...and I didn't get it,
then who?

21:26.040 --> 21:27.270
(GASPS)

21:31.810 --> 21:33.980
Come on. It was me.

21:35.680 --> 21:39.190
Oh, uh, for a minute there
we were thinking
it was Santa.

21:39.190 --> 21:42.760
Everybody knows that
Santa doesn't come
until we're asleep.

21:43.860 --> 21:47.190
So, you used your own money
to buy Charlie a doll house?

21:47.200 --> 21:51.230
She's only been
talking about it
for a month.

21:51.230 --> 21:53.100
And with Teddy
and PJ out of the house,

21:53.100 --> 21:56.300
I realized I needed to
step up and be a...
A good big brother.

21:57.770 --> 21:59.440
It's a Christmas miracle.

21:59.440 --> 22:00.870
(GASPS)

22:00.880 --> 22:04.140
Ew, stop. Stop.
Stop. Stop.

22:09.820 --> 22:13.250
<i>Hey, Charlie.</i>
<i>Well, even though we're not</i>
<i>all together for Christmas,</i>

22:13.250 --> 22:15.890
<i>I gotta say,</i>
<i>it's kind of cool</i>
<i>being in New York.</i>

22:15.890 --> 22:19.020
It's a pretty magical place.
WOMAN:   <i>Maybe for you.</i>

22:19.260 --> 22:21.330
<i>Hey, it's the lasagna lady.</i>

22:22.800 --> 22:25.160
<i>How was the party?</i>
<i>I didn't go.</i>

22:25.170 --> 22:27.970
<i>I traded the lasagna</i>
<i>for a jet ride,</i>

22:27.970 --> 22:30.070
<i>and then she never</i>
<i>called me back!</i>

22:32.140 --> 22:33.740
<i>Tough town.</i>

22:34.210 --> 22:35.980
<i>More caviar, please.</i>

22:36.240 --> 22:38.240
<i>Oh, not that much, you fool.</i>

22:38.680 --> 22:39.950
<i>And draw my bath.</i>

22:40.280 --> 22:42.850
PJ, what are you doing?
<i>Oh, I'm practicing.</i>

22:42.850 --> 22:44.320
<i>I've never had</i>
<i>a butler before.</i>

22:45.290 --> 22:47.990
Well, this should be
interesting.

22:47.990 --> 22:49.260
<i>Bring me my slippers.</i>

22:49.260 --> 22:53.190
<i>I know I don't live here,</i>
<i>don't you talk back to me.</i>

22:54.900 --> 22:59.170
Well, Merry Christmas
and wish us all good luck,
Charlie.

23:03.140 --> 23:04.200
(RATTLING)

23:04.440 --> 23:06.210
What do you think
is in here?

23:06.210 --> 23:10.280
but whatever it is,
I'm guessing
it's about to throw up.

23:11.950 --> 23:15.150
Am I wrong, or is Zuri
really pushing her luck
with Santa?

23:17.220 --> 23:19.990
Make sure to hang that one
on a sturdy hook.

23:19.990 --> 23:21.290
Coal is very heavy.

23:23.390 --> 23:25.190
I can't believe
you invited up

23:25.190 --> 23:27.860
two complete strangers
from off the street.

23:27.860 --> 23:29.730
No good can come of that.

23:29.730 --> 23:31.160
That's how I wound up
living here.

23:31.170 --> 23:32.430
Exactly.

23:34.330 --> 23:38.200
Hey, it's Christmas Eve!
Quit being such a scrooge!

23:38.210 --> 23:40.270
So, what did you get
the kids for Christmas?

23:40.270 --> 23:43.110
I don't know.
I just put my name on
all the gifts you got 'em.

23:44.740 --> 23:46.180
Just for that,
you are gonna
help me set up

23:46.180 --> 23:48.050
a Christmas
treasure hunt for them.

23:48.050 --> 23:50.350
(SCOFFS) How am I
supposed to put
my name on that?

23:56.260 --> 23:57.390
Hey, guys!

23:57.990 --> 24:00.090
Hello, Jessie.
Hi, everyone.

24:00.090 --> 24:04.300
(CHUCKLES)
This is Ravi, Emma, and Luke.
Welcome to our humble home.

24:04.300 --> 24:08.000
I guess in New York,
"humble" means "palace
towering over the city."

24:09.200 --> 24:11.270
My parents say
thanks again for
letting us stay here.

24:11.270 --> 24:14.010
We feel really bad
intruding on
your Christmas Eve.

24:14.170 --> 24:18.010
Aw, well, we wouldn't
want you to feel bad.

24:22.250 --> 24:26.220
Ignore our butler.
Hospitality is not really
his thing.

24:26.420 --> 24:29.920
Do you also have a chef
who hates to cook?

24:29.920 --> 24:31.760
Yeah. Same guy.

24:33.230 --> 24:35.930
The kids were actually
just about to open
their Christmas Eve gifts.

24:35.930 --> 24:37.230
Has everyone
picked out a present?

24:37.230 --> 24:40.130
Well, I have now.

24:41.230 --> 24:43.800
Luke Ross,
trust fund recipient.

24:47.970 --> 24:49.480
Is he the one
you warned me about?

24:50.840 --> 24:52.240
Mmm-hmm.

24:54.150 --> 24:56.320
He's the reason
we can't have
mistletoe anymore.

25:09.030 --> 25:11.260
What in the silver bells
happened here?

25:14.430 --> 25:17.240
Okay, who tried to wrap me?

25:19.140 --> 25:22.170
Hey, why was I
sleeping on the floor?

25:22.180 --> 25:25.840
And who's playing
the piano from the inside?

25:28.350 --> 25:30.020
(GRUNTS)
Luke?

25:30.020 --> 25:31.380
(COUGHING)

25:32.020 --> 25:35.420
Oh! That explains
why I dreamed
about flossing.

25:35.420 --> 25:37.360
We've all dreamed
about you flossing.

25:38.290 --> 25:40.230
JESSIE:
Watch out, watch out,
watch out, watch out.

25:40.230 --> 25:43.300
Ow! Ow! Ow! Yeah!

25:43.300 --> 25:44.230
(GRUNTS)

25:47.200 --> 25:49.070
What happened to our tree?

25:49.240 --> 25:51.340
And why am I
the only thing under it?

25:52.970 --> 25:55.870
OMG! All our presents
are gone!

25:55.880 --> 25:59.580
That's weird.
I've never heard of Santa
taking away presents!

25:59.580 --> 26:01.310
How naughty were you two?

26:03.150 --> 26:04.220
Guys!

26:06.290 --> 26:09.050
Remember that
cool chemistry set
I opened up last night?

26:09.060 --> 26:10.320
ALL: No.
Nerd.

26:12.490 --> 26:14.130
Neither do I.

26:14.130 --> 26:15.560
But I woke up
a few minutes ago,

26:15.560 --> 26:17.600
and I made some
troubling discoveries.

26:17.600 --> 26:19.130
Actually, I don't
remember anything

26:19.130 --> 26:21.270
that happened last night
after Teddy and PJ got here.

26:21.270 --> 26:25.440
Yeah, the last thing
I remember is
Freckles here hitting on me.

26:26.040 --> 26:29.310
And my last memory
is you saying
you'd go out with me.

26:33.310 --> 26:35.380
Why can't any of us
remember last night?

26:35.950 --> 26:37.380
Judging from my notes,
it appears

26:37.390 --> 26:41.320
I mixed a compound
which exploded
into a toxic vapor,

26:41.320 --> 26:45.520
that put us to sleep
and caused a retroactive
memory blackout.

26:45.530 --> 26:49.290
Sincerest apologies
from myself and the
Little Edison Toy Company.

26:50.260 --> 26:53.070
Okay, um, not to add
another problem to the list,

26:53.070 --> 26:54.370
but has anyone
seen my brother?

26:54.570 --> 26:56.170
(HIGH-PITCHED SCREAMING)

26:56.170 --> 26:57.940
No, but do you have
a sister?

27:01.340 --> 27:03.510
It's in there!
It's big, it's scary,

27:03.510 --> 27:05.640
and when I woke up,
it was nibbling on me!

27:05.650 --> 27:07.110
The lizard?
The butler?

27:08.180 --> 27:09.210
(SNORTING)

27:09.620 --> 27:12.320
Whoa, it's a reindeer!

27:12.320 --> 27:13.390
I thought it was a moose!

27:16.460 --> 27:18.190
Nice reindeer.

27:18.560 --> 27:19.660
Please tell me
you're on a break

27:19.660 --> 27:21.330
and Santa's on his way
to pick you up!

27:24.660 --> 27:26.470
Yes, Dad, we're having
a great Christmas.

27:26.470 --> 27:28.370
They even have a reindeer.

27:29.400 --> 27:32.270
Right, uh, yeah,
of course, a plastic one.

27:32.270 --> 27:35.240
A real one would be
bizarre and frightening.

27:36.380 --> 27:38.210
Good boy, Prancer.

27:38.210 --> 27:41.080
More like Biter.
Or Kicker.

27:43.520 --> 27:46.450
We looked everywhere,
but we could not find
any presents.

27:46.450 --> 27:48.150
Not even socks.

27:48.160 --> 27:49.220
(SOBBING)

27:49.220 --> 27:53.160
At this point,
I'd be happy with
an acrylic sweater.

27:53.530 --> 27:55.590
Santa, if you're listening,
I didn't mean that!

27:57.100 --> 28:00.030
Okay, we need to
figure this out before
your parents get home.

28:00.030 --> 28:01.430
We'll split into
two teams.

28:01.970 --> 28:04.170
Boys, you sift through
the wreckage for anything

28:04.170 --> 28:06.210
that might help us
remember what happened
last night.

28:06.210 --> 28:09.270
And, as we sift,
we will also dust
and put away!

28:10.010 --> 28:12.110
I seriously need to
change teams.

28:13.410 --> 28:14.650
PJ, you're in charge.

28:14.650 --> 28:16.280
Really? Cool!

28:18.250 --> 28:19.380
Ravi, you're in charge.

28:21.690 --> 28:25.990
Ugh! I can't believe I have
to clean up your stupid
chemistry set on Christmas.

28:25.990 --> 28:29.130
Stop crying over
spilled magnesium citrate,

28:29.130 --> 28:32.030
and help us find some clues
about what happened
last night!

28:32.030 --> 28:33.330
Hey, guys, I think
I found our first clue!

28:33.330 --> 28:35.770
Because this paper says,
"Your first clue."

28:37.200 --> 28:38.700
Ooh! Dibs on reading it!

28:40.510 --> 28:42.740
"Welcome to your
Christmas treasure hunt."

28:42.740 --> 28:44.740
What a whimsical
holiday treat.

28:47.010 --> 28:49.310
"Sure, it is fun
to just get a present,

28:49.320 --> 28:51.350
"but hunting for it
is much more pleasant."

28:51.650 --> 28:53.250
Someone hid our presents?

28:53.550 --> 28:55.620
What kind of sicko
would do that?

29:03.700 --> 29:08.300
so we've got about
five minutes to check
last night's security footage.

29:08.300 --> 29:10.300
He had Taco Queen
for breakfast.

29:10.640 --> 29:12.300
We've got at least 20.

29:13.710 --> 29:17.140
We need to figure out
what happened after you
and PJ got here last night.

29:17.280 --> 29:19.580
Yeah, and who let
a reindeer up
unannounced.

29:19.810 --> 29:22.410
If you knew our door staff,
you wouldn't be
surprised by that.

29:23.550 --> 29:26.620
Just keep looking
for the monster
who stole our presents!

29:27.090 --> 29:30.420
Okay, no reindeer
or monsters yet.

29:31.820 --> 29:33.690
(CHUCKLES)
That's a giant elf.

29:35.600 --> 29:37.830
That's no elf,
that's our butler!

29:37.830 --> 29:39.360
It was Bertram?

29:39.370 --> 29:41.700
I always knew
he was part Grinch!

29:42.340 --> 29:44.700
He's stealing presents
from children?

29:44.710 --> 29:47.410
It does not get
any lower than that.

29:47.410 --> 29:49.640
Whoa, it looks like
he didn't act alone.

29:50.280 --> 29:51.440
TEDDY: Jessie?

29:53.280 --> 29:54.410
(UNEASY CHUCKLE)

29:54.420 --> 29:56.620
Okay, maybe not
the lowest.

29:57.250 --> 29:59.320
It's not like
anybody died.

30:00.290 --> 30:02.320
We haven't seen
the rest of the tape.

30:03.690 --> 30:05.490
It was you?

30:05.490 --> 30:07.330
You stole our presents?

30:08.230 --> 30:10.460
(STUTTERING)
I don't know why I would...

30:11.360 --> 30:14.330
Oh! Now I remember!

30:14.340 --> 30:19.140
I wanted to give you guys
a Christmas treasure hunt,
so I hid all your presents.

30:19.140 --> 30:20.410
Sounds fun, right?

30:22.380 --> 30:24.380
Not as fun as finding them
under the tree!

30:24.380 --> 30:27.810
And opening them
in our jammies,
as Santa intended!

30:28.850 --> 30:31.320
Okay, guys, relax.

30:31.320 --> 30:32.850
We'll just go
get the presents.

30:32.850 --> 30:34.550
Great, where are they?

30:34.820 --> 30:36.390
I have no idea.

30:37.220 --> 30:40.430
Oh, someone's about to get
Jack Frosted up!

30:40.760 --> 30:42.290
(GRUNTING)

30:42.300 --> 30:44.460
Why didn't you just
hide them in the apartment?

30:44.470 --> 30:46.400
Yeah, that would
have been smarter.

30:47.300 --> 30:48.770
Okay, who invited her?

30:54.440 --> 30:56.140
(GRUNTING) Let me at her!

30:57.480 --> 30:59.910
Zuri, aren't you
the same girl who was just
on the subway yesterday

30:59.910 --> 31:01.380
preaching peace on Earth?

31:01.380 --> 31:04.150
All I know is,
I don't have my presents,

31:04.150 --> 31:06.280
so I need something
to rip open!

31:06.620 --> 31:09.350
(GRUNTING)
Okay, guys, calm down!

31:09.360 --> 31:12.920
Let's just empty our pockets
and purses and see
if anything jogs my memory.

31:15.260 --> 31:16.360
Nope.

31:17.230 --> 31:19.360
All I have is my emergency
change of jewelry.

31:20.470 --> 31:23.340
All I've got is
my walking around cash.

31:25.170 --> 31:27.510
Well, um, I've got nothing,

31:27.510 --> 31:30.380
but dibs on checking
your couch cushions!

31:31.310 --> 31:35.610
Okay, ball of lint,
certificate for a full-body
eucalyptus wrap,

31:35.620 --> 31:38.280
and a receipt
for a locker rental
in Central Park.

31:38.620 --> 31:40.820
I gave you that
certificate months ago!

31:40.820 --> 31:42.690
You're a thief
and ungrateful!

31:43.320 --> 31:45.690
Well, excuse me
for not wanting to
spend five hours

31:45.690 --> 31:47.390
just to smell like
a koala snack!

31:48.230 --> 31:50.860
Wait, this receipt
is dated December 24th.

31:50.860 --> 31:53.630
For locker number 339
at the skating rink.

31:53.630 --> 31:55.200
Maybe I put
the presents in there!

31:55.200 --> 31:57.440
Then what are we
doing here? Let's go!

32:01.340 --> 32:05.240
Um, guys, uh, we're no
t taking the reindeer
with us, right?

32:05.250 --> 32:07.950
(CHUCKLES)
Of course not,
that would be silly.

32:08.450 --> 32:11.380
Sean, would you mind
watching our dog?

32:13.390 --> 32:14.520
Bye, Spot.

32:19.230 --> 32:20.430
(SOFTLY)
I think he bought it.

32:23.300 --> 32:25.300
Oh, there is
the 12th clue!

32:26.930 --> 32:28.370
All right.

32:29.340 --> 32:31.840
"Now you have come
to the glorious stage,

32:31.840 --> 32:34.410
"where the answer is found
in the reptile's cage."

32:35.270 --> 32:37.310
Oh, reptile!
This one's easy.

32:37.310 --> 32:39.850
Wait! Mrs. Kipling
does not like
strangers in her...

32:39.850 --> 32:41.010
(ROARING)
(SCREAMING)

32:41.010 --> 32:42.450
...cage.

32:43.320 --> 32:44.650
(PANTING)

32:45.550 --> 32:47.320
I got... I got it!

32:48.650 --> 32:52.320
Whew! Wow, there's a lot
of unexpected wildlife
in this apartment.

32:55.360 --> 32:56.560
Okay, final clue.

32:56.930 --> 32:59.030
"Don't rush off,
stop and think.

32:59.030 --> 33:01.900
"Your presents are
in a box by the rink."

33:02.500 --> 33:05.000
It must mean
the ice skating rink
in Central Park.

33:05.010 --> 33:06.840
Yes! Ravi, you're brilliant!
Let's go!

33:06.840 --> 33:10.410
Oh! Uh, on the way,

33:10.410 --> 33:13.650
can we stop and pick up
a tourniquet
and a pint of O-negative?

33:17.780 --> 33:20.390
Here it is!
Locker 339!

33:20.390 --> 33:21.850
Okay, I have the combination.

33:22.690 --> 33:26.890
"Balance due 25 cents?"
Does anyone have a quarter?

33:26.890 --> 33:28.430
Here, I have one.
Oh.

33:31.460 --> 33:32.530
Okay...

33:32.800 --> 33:35.070
(GRUNTS)
ALL: (GASPING) Bertram!

33:35.070 --> 33:36.700
What are you
doing in there?

33:36.700 --> 33:39.540
Trying to keep my elbow
out of my gall bladder!

33:40.970 --> 33:43.480
Jessie, last night,
you were supposed to
come right back for me!

33:43.480 --> 33:45.710
Why didn't you?
Uh, I have no idea!

33:45.710 --> 33:47.510
None of us have
any memory of last night.

33:47.510 --> 33:48.950
(SCOFFS)
Must be nice!

33:50.180 --> 33:53.550
I spent the entire night
wedged inside
this stinky locker!

33:53.550 --> 33:55.690
I'll never be able to
go to the gym again.

33:55.690 --> 33:57.020
Again?

33:58.420 --> 34:00.160
Don't you even start!

34:01.460 --> 34:03.400
Wait, why are you
trapped in there?

34:03.800 --> 34:06.430
Aw, did Santa
give you a time-out?

34:06.430 --> 34:08.400
(GIGGLING)

34:08.400 --> 34:10.040
Jessie, this is all
your fault.

34:12.340 --> 34:14.340
The kids were asleep
when we left,

34:14.340 --> 34:17.480
so I don't understand
why we had to
wear these stupid costumes.

34:17.880 --> 34:20.380
I just wanted to see
if you'd actually put it on.

34:20.909 --> 34:23.750
(LAUGHING)
Now I have next year's
Christmas card!

34:25.989 --> 34:27.389
Come on,
let's go home.

34:28.719 --> 34:31.889
Uh-oh, it's Zuri!
What is she doing
not in bed?

34:31.889 --> 34:33.590
Why don't you ask her nanny?

34:34.060 --> 34:36.030
Oh, right.
(SCOFFS)

34:36.030 --> 34:38.960
Just hide! I don't want
my Christmas surprise
to get spoiled.

34:38.969 --> 34:41.830
Where?
In there! There!
There, there! Go.

34:42.370 --> 34:43.969
Go, go, go!
(GRUNTING)

34:46.070 --> 34:50.380
(GRUNTING) I can't!
What do you think
is back here, Narnia?

34:56.020 --> 34:58.820
I know Jessie and Bertram
are here somewhere.

34:58.820 --> 35:01.490
I saw them sneak out
with all the presents!

35:02.120 --> 35:03.760
Okay, we've been
wandering around so long,

35:03.760 --> 35:05.960
I am starting to
recognize all the rats.

35:07.890 --> 35:09.900
Can we please go back home?

35:09.900 --> 35:14.000
Hey, I don't know
how you roll in
that Podunk hill town,

35:14.000 --> 35:16.500
but here in New York,
we get what's ours.

35:17.400 --> 35:20.810
Okay, Denver is not
a Podunk hill town.

35:20.810 --> 35:24.110
We have a pro football team,
and our own omelet!

35:25.950 --> 35:29.110
Call me when you have
two football teams,
and Jay-Z.

35:35.020 --> 35:37.460
All right, Bertram,
they're all gone,
you can come out now.

35:40.860 --> 35:42.090
Uh-oh.

35:43.160 --> 35:45.530
BERTRAM: What does
"uh-oh" mean?

35:45.530 --> 35:48.670
It locked automatically,
and I need a quarter
to get you out!

35:48.670 --> 35:51.170
Go ahead, splurge.
I'll pay you back.

35:52.940 --> 35:55.070
I don't have a quarter!

35:55.080 --> 35:58.080
Okay, I'll run home
to get one,
and be right back.

35:58.080 --> 36:01.780
Just try to relax,
and breathe through this.

36:01.780 --> 36:03.110
BERTRAM: Oh, thanks.

36:03.820 --> 36:06.720
Oh, wait, where did you
get this straw?

36:06.720 --> 36:07.820
From the trash.

36:08.020 --> 36:09.090
(SPUTTERS)

36:11.120 --> 36:12.890
(SOBBING)

36:15.590 --> 36:16.960
Then you never came back!

36:16.960 --> 36:20.200
I was stuck in here
with a moldy
salami sandwich!

36:20.770 --> 36:24.600
Don't judge me!
You didn't live through
what I did!

36:26.110 --> 36:30.010
(PANTING) Okay, the presents
are in one of these lockers!

36:30.010 --> 36:31.510
We know, Sherlock.

36:32.180 --> 36:34.980
Oh, hello, Bertram.
Merry Christmas.

36:38.120 --> 36:41.720
Aw, you must have
followed my
Christmas treasure hunt!

36:41.720 --> 36:44.860
Indeed we did,
and what a delightful
romp it was!

36:44.860 --> 36:45.990
Delightful?

36:46.160 --> 36:47.790
I was almost
eaten by a dragon!

36:47.790 --> 36:49.260
And the presents
aren't even for me!

36:50.160 --> 36:52.100
My dad always hid
my Christmas presents.

36:52.100 --> 36:54.670
He said, "You never get
anything in life
without working for it."

36:54.970 --> 36:57.800
Except presents!
That's the whole point!

37:00.240 --> 37:03.710
You know, I actually think
a Christmas treasure hunt
is very inventive.

37:03.710 --> 37:08.950
You're from Colorado.
You think electricity
is inventive.

37:10.220 --> 37:13.790
Zuri! You loved Colorado
when we went
skiing there last year.

37:14.090 --> 37:16.290
Oh, that was Colorado?

37:16.290 --> 37:21.930
Well, in my defense,
it's very easy to
fall asleep on a private jet.

37:22.930 --> 37:25.600
You're a very
annoying little girl.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.970
Bertram, which locker
are the presents in?

37:29.970 --> 37:33.100
The combination is in
my pocket, if you'll...

37:33.110 --> 37:34.670
It's in his pocket!
...just help me
out of here.

37:36.840 --> 37:39.110
BERTRAM: Ow! Ow! Ow!

37:39.110 --> 37:40.910
Got it!
Okay, come on, come on.

37:41.280 --> 37:42.750
(GROANS)

37:45.050 --> 37:47.250
Oh.
Wha...

37:47.250 --> 37:48.920
We need a quarter.

37:49.090 --> 37:50.720
Sorry, I'm all out.

37:51.190 --> 37:53.220
Well, why don't you break
one of your hundreds?

37:54.860 --> 37:58.060
if you'll just
let me out of here!
He has a quarter!

37:58.300 --> 38:00.630
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

38:00.630 --> 38:02.130
Kids, be careful!

38:02.330 --> 38:04.000
I think this might
qualify as a mugging.

38:04.940 --> 38:06.270
(GRUNTS) Found it!
(GASPS)

38:07.840 --> 38:08.910
(GRUNTS)

38:10.080 --> 38:11.210
(ALL GASPING)

38:11.210 --> 38:12.310
(ALL CHEERING)
ZURI: Jackpot! Yeah!

38:17.120 --> 38:21.150
I knew you'd have fun
on my treasure hunt!

38:21.590 --> 38:23.790
Well, all's well
that ends well.

38:24.090 --> 38:26.930
Get me out of here!

38:32.300 --> 38:34.870
You know, now that
Bertram explained everything,

38:34.870 --> 38:36.840
it's all starting to
come back to me.

38:36.840 --> 38:39.600
Yeah, me, too.
But I still feel like we're
forgetting of something.

38:39.610 --> 38:41.310
(SNORTING)
JESSIE: And there it is.

38:44.280 --> 38:46.880
Guys, I just found
the weirdest thing!

38:46.880 --> 38:48.350
(GASPING) Second weirdest.

38:50.680 --> 38:52.150
Suddenly, Zuri and Teddy

38:52.150 --> 38:55.220
being wanted for
reindeer-napping
makes perfect sense.

38:55.750 --> 38:57.720
What, so you two
stole the reindeer?

38:58.260 --> 39:00.690
Huh, there's a sentence
I never thought I'd say.

39:02.290 --> 39:05.030
I don't remember
stealing a reindeer!

39:05.030 --> 39:07.870
But it sounds like
something someone
from Denver would do.

39:07.870 --> 39:09.100
Zuri, that's enough!

39:09.100 --> 39:13.300
Maybe a little innocent
reindeer-tipping,
now and then, but...

39:15.240 --> 39:17.640
It says Prancer was
supposed to be a part of

39:17.640 --> 39:19.210
the charity concert
in the park today.

39:19.210 --> 39:21.250
You mean,
that deer can sing?

39:21.980 --> 39:24.080
Oh, you two
are going away for life!

39:27.250 --> 39:30.260
Jessie, why do we
have to confess?

39:30.260 --> 39:32.820
Why can't we just release
Prancer and run.

39:32.830 --> 39:34.430
Yeah, for once,
I agree with her.

39:35.090 --> 39:36.730
It's a Christmas miracle.

39:36.960 --> 39:39.760
Yeah.
Aw, look at that
sad little pen.

39:40.170 --> 39:42.130
Oh, now I remember
why we took him!

39:42.140 --> 39:43.740
Yeah, yeah, me, too!

39:44.200 --> 39:46.700
After we couldn't
find you and Bertram
last night,

39:46.710 --> 39:48.940
we saw Prancer
locked up in that prison,

39:48.940 --> 39:50.410
so I decided to
take him home.

39:50.940 --> 39:52.340
And you went along
with that?

39:52.350 --> 39:57.780
Either face an angry,
snorting beast,
or the reindeer.

39:57.780 --> 39:58.980
(SNORTING)

39:59.920 --> 40:01.990
Prancer! Thank goodness!

40:01.990 --> 40:03.290
Where was he?

40:03.290 --> 40:07.190
We found him
in our building.
In the Statue of Liberty.

40:08.960 --> 40:10.700
Wait a minute.

40:11.460 --> 40:14.130
You two stole Prancer!

40:14.800 --> 40:16.300
I'm calling the cops!

40:16.300 --> 40:18.900
Okay, okay!
We did it.

40:18.910 --> 40:20.340
But you wouldn't
send three sweet,

40:20.340 --> 40:23.070
young girls to jail,
would you?

40:23.080 --> 40:24.710
Uh, not three!
I'm innocent!

40:26.110 --> 40:27.280
And they're really sorry.

40:28.110 --> 40:30.250
Sorry won't raise money
for the kids.

40:30.250 --> 40:32.450
Or put toys
in their donation bins.

40:32.450 --> 40:34.190
But you've got
Prancer back now,

40:34.190 --> 40:36.190
and you're still having
the charity concert, right?

40:36.190 --> 40:39.260
Wrong! After Prancer
went missing,

40:39.260 --> 40:43.760
our singer, Joey Fatone,
helped search for him.

40:43.760 --> 40:46.160
He was out there all night,
calling Prancer's name,

40:46.170 --> 40:49.030
and by this morning,
he lost his voice.

40:49.040 --> 40:51.270
And his watch.
He was mugged.

40:53.010 --> 40:55.240
Wow, way to
bring down the room.

40:56.280 --> 40:58.310
She could still
call the cops.
Dial it back.

41:02.280 --> 41:05.350
So now the charity event
has their reindeer back,
but they don't have a singer.

41:05.350 --> 41:08.120
Zuri, I am so
disappointed in you.

41:08.820 --> 41:11.090
I can't believe
you stole a reindeer
without me!

41:11.090 --> 41:12.290
That was
on my bucket list!

41:13.430 --> 41:14.960
As long as I'm not on it.

41:16.830 --> 41:20.160
I can't believe we came
so close to meeting
the Joey Fatone.

41:21.900 --> 41:24.470
Guys, the point is,

41:24.470 --> 41:27.340
this event
was going to help a lot of
kids have a happy Christmas,

41:27.340 --> 41:29.410
and now that's not
going to happen.

41:29.840 --> 41:31.540
And it's all our fault!

41:31.540 --> 41:33.210
I feel terrible.

41:33.210 --> 41:36.450
We were so upset
when we could not
find our presents.

41:36.450 --> 41:39.780
Imagine how these kids
will feel when they
do not get any.

41:40.190 --> 41:42.190
There's got to be
something we can do.

41:42.190 --> 41:44.990
Wait! I just got
the greatest idea!

41:44.990 --> 41:46.890
You can sing
at the charity concert,

41:46.890 --> 41:49.790
which will attract
a huge crowd
of toy-givers,

41:49.800 --> 41:51.230
thereby saving the day?

41:51.500 --> 41:56.100
we do an emergency
bake sale, but I like
your idea way better!

41:59.440 --> 42:02.440
Jessie, thank you so much
for offering to sing
for the charity.

42:03.810 --> 42:05.440
You can sing, right?

42:07.350 --> 42:09.010
Like a bird.

42:09.020 --> 42:10.920
And she looks cuter
than a partridge
in a pear tree!

42:10.920 --> 42:12.320
(CHUCKLES) Thanks.

42:13.320 --> 42:15.550
I just wish we had
more than three peeps
a watchin'.

42:16.120 --> 42:18.860
Yeah, it's not
the turnout we expected,

42:18.860 --> 42:21.260
but at least
we'll get a few toys.

42:22.060 --> 42:23.900
More than a few! Look.

42:23.900 --> 42:25.230
(GASPING)

42:28.530 --> 42:30.270
Look at all the presents!

42:32.870 --> 42:34.870
Jessie, we thought about
what you said,

42:34.870 --> 42:36.470
and we realized
we've only been thinking

42:36.480 --> 42:38.340
about ourselves
this Christmas.

42:38.350 --> 42:41.610
So we want to donate
all of our presents
to the toy drive.

42:41.610 --> 42:43.210
You do?

42:43.550 --> 42:45.620
That is so sweet of you.

42:46.250 --> 42:48.020
I am so proud of you guys!

42:48.220 --> 42:50.250
Well, we already have
so much.

42:51.020 --> 42:52.360
And, you know what?

42:52.360 --> 42:54.330
Not being selfish
feels really good.

42:54.560 --> 42:56.160
Aw, Luke.

42:57.400 --> 43:00.700
(CHUCKLES) Wow,
look what was tucked in
with these socks!

43:00.700 --> 43:03.400
An Amazon river cruise
and zip-line adventure!

43:04.100 --> 43:05.640
(LAUGHING)
(SOBBING)

43:09.210 --> 43:10.270
Still proud.

completely remember.

I just wish I knew
what experiment
I was attempting last night

44:59.220 --> 45:03.050
that rendered us
unconscious and erased
our short-term memory.

knock-out serum?

We need to tranquilize
this reindeer stat!

45:35.320 --> 45:38.260
Luke, add
the chartreuse chemical!

45:38.260 --> 45:39.690
I don't know
what chartreuse is!

45:39.690 --> 45:41.490
Uh, here! Let's use this!

45:41.490 --> 45:43.760
No! That is turquoise,
you idiot!

45:44.600 --> 45:48.170
(COUGHS) You couldn't
just have red, blue, green,
and yellow?

45:48.170 --> 45:51.370
Uh-oh! You have turned
the knock-out serum
into a vapor,

45:51.370 --> 45:53.200

knock us out!
