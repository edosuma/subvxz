WEBVTT

00:01.066 --> 00:02.968
Does everybody
know what time it is?

00:02.969 --> 00:04.803
<i>Tool time!</i>

00:04.804 --> 00:06.470
That's right. Binford tools
is proud to present

00:06.471 --> 00:09.640
Tim "the tool man" taylor!

00:09.641 --> 00:11.609
<i>(â™ª "tool time" theme)</i>

00:14.880 --> 00:17.182
Thank you.

00:17.183 --> 00:19.650
Ok, thank you, heidi,
and thank you, everyone.

00:19.651 --> 00:22.720
Welcome to <i>tool time.</i>
I am tim "the tool man" taylor.

00:22.721 --> 00:28.193
And you all know my assistant,
al "he's a thorn in my - ow! -
Siding" borland.

00:28.194 --> 00:31.262
What tim is trying to say is
it's siding week on <i>tool time.</i>

00:31.263 --> 00:33.498
And today we're gonna be
working with aluminum.

00:33.499 --> 00:35.800
Or as I like to call it:

00:35.801 --> 00:38.002
"al-luminum."

00:43.241 --> 00:46.945
You're the only one that thinks
it's funny putting the word "al"
in every sentence.

00:46.946 --> 00:49.814
"al" be the judge of that.

00:54.453 --> 00:58.790
A few more jokes like that,
you'll be working in "al-toona."

00:58.791 --> 01:02.727
Sorry. All right, let's get
to our "inst-al-lation."

01:02.728 --> 01:06.064
Would you stop it, please?

01:06.065 --> 01:10.401
We showed you how to
install your foam board
over your existing shingles.

01:10.402 --> 01:11.903
Now it's time
to turn to aluminum.

01:11.904 --> 01:15.040
And our siding comes
in 12-foot lengths.

01:15.041 --> 01:20.579
You're often gonna need to
cut this around the lighting
fixtures and faucets.

01:20.580 --> 01:23.514
Which means you'll have
to do some measuring.

01:23.515 --> 01:25.917
Al uses the old
carpenter's adage,

01:25.918 --> 01:28.553
"measure twice,
cut once."

01:28.554 --> 01:32.090
Tim's adage is,
"never measure,
cut yourself."

01:35.027 --> 01:37.662
Overlapping these panels
is an art form.
Right.

01:37.663 --> 01:42.700
And you want to nail these
panels right into the stud.

01:42.701 --> 01:47.271
You can help yourself by
pre-measuring where the studs
are on your old siding.

01:47.272 --> 01:50.475
Tim already knows...
Where the stud is.
Of course I do.

01:50.476 --> 01:52.109
But al's point
is well-taken,

01:52.110 --> 01:53.711
'cause you might
inadvertently

01:53.712 --> 01:56.380
Nail right in through
a gas line.

01:56.381 --> 02:00.018
Or water line.
Or worse yet,
electrical line.

02:00.019 --> 02:01.953
Aah!

02:07.659 --> 02:10.127
Well...

02:10.128 --> 02:12.998
Aluminum is a great
conductor of electricity.

02:15.968 --> 02:17.902
Al?

02:17.903 --> 02:20.671
You all right, buddy? Al?

02:24.277 --> 02:27.845
Well, at least we know
he's "al-live."

03:19.298 --> 03:22.267
<i>(tractor backing up, beeping)</i>

03:22.268 --> 03:23.634
Is that dad?

03:23.635 --> 03:25.836
<i>(crash)</i>
ow!

03:27.906 --> 03:30.375
That's dad.

03:30.376 --> 03:33.044
Yeah. He's building the sets
for randy's school play.

03:33.045 --> 03:35.780
What does dad know
about shakespeare?

03:35.781 --> 03:40.185
About as much as shakespeare
knew about tractor pulls.

03:40.186 --> 03:42.887
My leg!

03:42.888 --> 03:45.356
Here's the mock-up
of the set.

03:45.357 --> 03:46.925
The first
<i>romeo and juliet</i>
production

03:46.926 --> 03:50.861
Where the castle's made
entirely of aluminum siding.

03:54.566 --> 03:56.601
Aluminum siding?
Yeah.

03:56.602 --> 03:59.337
I had a truckload of it.
We had tons left
after <i>tool time.</i>

03:59.338 --> 04:02.707
So you got aluminum siding,
storm windows.

04:02.708 --> 04:05.543
Since when did romeo and juliet
move to the suburbs?

04:07.612 --> 04:11.482
They were tired of all the
sword-fighting downtown.

04:11.483 --> 04:13.584
How's your paper coming?

04:13.585 --> 04:16.220
Well...
Uh. Say no more.

04:16.221 --> 04:19.857
I had that look on my face
all through college.

04:19.858 --> 04:21.892
All eight years.
<i>(groans)</i>

04:24.063 --> 04:28.566
Hey, romeo. There's your set.
How did rehearsal go?

04:28.567 --> 04:32.003
Terrible.
You know how my drama teacher
was eight months pregnant?

04:32.004 --> 04:35.006
She went into labor
and had to be rushed
to the hospital.

04:35.007 --> 04:37.809
How is she?
She's fine.
But the play's off.

04:37.810 --> 04:40.879
I've planned for these sets.
She can't do this to me.

04:40.880 --> 04:44.649
Well, what do you want her to
do, tim? Put the baby back in?

04:46.351 --> 04:48.953
Just till opening night.

04:48.954 --> 04:51.523
Isn't there some other teacher
that can take over?

04:51.524 --> 04:55.960
It's the end of the year.
They're all tied up
with other projects.

04:55.961 --> 04:58.029
Randy...

05:00.766 --> 05:02.901
How would you like it
if I directed your play?

05:02.902 --> 05:07.171
I think my mom directing me
in a love scene could seriously
screw me up for life.

05:09.575 --> 05:12.076
Honey, honey, honey,
he's probably right.

05:12.077 --> 05:14.346
I'll direct.

05:14.347 --> 05:17.649
Shakespeare's pretty
deep stuff, tim.

05:17.650 --> 05:19.283
Oh, give me a break.

05:19.284 --> 05:21.185
"to be or not to be"
isn't any deeper than

05:21.186 --> 05:23.821
"does everybody know
what time it is?"

05:25.958 --> 05:28.760
What about wilson
directing the play?

05:28.761 --> 05:31.195
I don't know.
Wilson can be a bit weird.

05:31.196 --> 05:34.165
You won't find anybody more
capable. Wilson'd be great.

05:34.166 --> 05:36.368
Or you could take
a shot and go with me.

05:36.369 --> 05:38.236
Wilson!

05:40.639 --> 05:43.407
Oh! Oh, oh! Ah...

05:51.249 --> 05:53.952
You called,
young randy?
What are you doing?

05:53.953 --> 05:56.221
Well, I'm practicing
walking on hot coals.

05:56.222 --> 05:59.691
I'm going to greece next week
for a fire-walking festival.

05:59.692 --> 06:02.927
Sounds like a hot time.

06:02.928 --> 06:05.063
Well, it's a lot more
fun than it sounds.

06:05.064 --> 06:07.465
Ow, ow, ow!

06:11.804 --> 06:16.373
It's too bad you're busy.
I was gonna ask you if you
wanted to direct my school play.

06:18.543 --> 06:20.011
<i>Romeo and juliet?</i>

06:20.012 --> 06:22.546
Yeah. The director
had to drop out.

06:22.547 --> 06:25.316
Oh, randy,
I'm so sorry.

06:25.317 --> 06:28.052
Normally I would just
jump at that chance.

06:28.053 --> 06:30.654
Oh! Oh, oh!

06:32.557 --> 06:35.126
See, it's long been a dream
of mine to direct shakespeare.

06:35.127 --> 06:38.963
Well, wilson, this could
make your dream come true.

06:38.964 --> 06:43.768
Not to mention my dream
of kissing sharon liebowitz.

06:43.769 --> 06:47.105
Even if I agree to do it,
how do you know the school
will approve?

06:47.106 --> 06:48.906
They'll love the idea.

06:48.907 --> 06:51.442
You've got the qualities
no one else has.
What?

06:51.443 --> 06:53.377
You're available
and you're not pregnant.

07:00.785 --> 07:05.123
You're incredible. Just when
we thought the play was dead,
you find a new director.

07:05.124 --> 07:08.526
I knew how much you
wanted to play juliet,
and I couldn't let you down.

07:08.527 --> 07:11.362
I might have to hug you.
I might have to let you.

07:12.965 --> 07:18.169
Everybody, I'd like you to meet
your new director, mr. Wilson.

07:26.345 --> 07:29.881
Hidy-hoeth,
young thespians.

07:29.882 --> 07:32.116
As you can see,
I've brought a lot
of reference books.

07:32.117 --> 07:34.652
We're very lucky
to have mr. Wilson.

07:34.653 --> 07:36.253
With his broad knowledge
of shakespeare,

07:36.254 --> 07:38.590
I'm confident we can
realize our goal.

07:38.591 --> 07:41.593
Oh, I can assure you
they'll be riveted
to their seats.

07:41.594 --> 07:45.729
Riveted, stapled,
hot-glued -
whatever works.

07:47.466 --> 07:50.802
All-righty-righty, class.

07:50.803 --> 07:53.605
Let us begin.

07:53.606 --> 07:57.809
Now, randy taylor
is our young romeo.

07:57.810 --> 08:00.812
And who, pray tell,
is our juliet?

08:00.813 --> 08:04.382
That would be I,
sharon liebowitz.

08:04.383 --> 08:08.886
Well, miss liebowitz,
in act one, scene five...

08:08.887 --> 08:12.223
Juliet falls in love
with romeo.

08:12.224 --> 08:15.927
He takes your hand...
Randy? And you say...

08:15.928 --> 08:19.497
"good pilgrim,
you do wrong your hand
too much, which..."

08:19.498 --> 08:24.002
Now, stop right there, juliet.
Can you tell me the significance
of that line?

08:24.003 --> 08:28.339
That I actually
remembered it.

08:28.340 --> 08:29.774
All right!

08:29.775 --> 08:33.010
Can anyone else
tell me what it means?

08:33.011 --> 08:36.147
This is very troubling.

08:36.148 --> 08:39.751
How can one act shakespeare
if one does not understand him?

08:39.751 --> 08:41.219
We'll have to start
at the beginning.

08:41.220 --> 08:43.488
Beginning of the play
or the scene?

08:43.489 --> 08:47.091
No. The beginning
of shakespeare's life.

08:47.092 --> 08:48.793
In order to interpret
shakespeare,

08:48.794 --> 08:52.196
You have to have a perspective
on the time in which he lived.

08:52.197 --> 08:53.164
Now, everybody
gather 'round.

08:53.165 --> 08:56.233
Gather, gather.
Gather. Gather, gather.

08:56.234 --> 09:00.004
Is this guy for real?
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

09:00.005 --> 09:05.543
Now, shakespeare was born
at stratford-on-avon in 1564.

09:05.544 --> 09:08.880
He wrote a lot of plays.
Some were funny, some weren't.
Let's start!

09:08.881 --> 09:11.449
Yeah!
No, no, no.
Sit, sit, sit.

09:11.450 --> 09:14.985
I can understand what
you're saying. You're not
the analytical types.

09:14.986 --> 09:17.789
So, we'll get right
back to the play.
Great.

09:17.790 --> 09:22.093
But first I'd like to
engage in some very basic
acting exercises

09:22.094 --> 09:24.862
Which will help rid you
of your inhibitions.

09:24.863 --> 09:27.965
All right, now, everybody
can stand. Stand. Stand.

09:27.966 --> 09:30.835
Stand up. Stand up.
On your toesies.
Tip, tip, tip.

09:30.836 --> 09:32.837
Up on your toes.
Up on your toes.

09:32.838 --> 09:35.773
Put your arms at your side.
Arms at the side.

09:35.774 --> 09:40.545
Now, flail your arms.
Flail your arms.
Flail, flail. Flail.

09:40.546 --> 09:43.380
Flail in the wind.
Flail in the wind.

09:43.381 --> 09:46.451
Flail, romeo.
Flail, romeo.
Flail!

09:46.452 --> 09:50.455
Very good.
Very good.
Very good.

09:50.456 --> 09:54.425
Now... Now I want you
to close your eyes,
close your eyes.

09:54.426 --> 09:59.830
Close your eyes
and pretend you
are a vegetable.

09:59.831 --> 10:02.933
You can be any vegetable.
Any vegetable.

10:02.934 --> 10:06.070
You can be a carrot.
You can be a turnip.

10:06.071 --> 10:09.107
You can be very ambitious -
you can be a radish.

10:09.108 --> 10:12.710
Thanks a lot, randy.
I thought I was gonna be
in a play, not in a salad.

10:14.513 --> 10:19.383
Now, next I want you
to turn to the person
next to you

10:19.384 --> 10:22.987
And give them a big hug.

10:22.988 --> 10:26.858
Oh, now, come on, come on.
Give 'em a big hug.
Be a good neighbor.

10:26.859 --> 10:28.959
Hey!

10:28.960 --> 10:31.428
Very good.
Very good.

10:34.499 --> 10:36.834
I finished my homework.
I'm going to the mall.

10:36.835 --> 10:38.669
Wait, wait, wait,
wait! Hold it!

10:38.670 --> 10:41.839
I'll get my keys.
I'll drive you over.

10:41.840 --> 10:43.340
Sorry. You know the rule.
You can't go to the mall

10:43.341 --> 10:45.943
Until you're done
with your homework.

10:48.547 --> 10:52.750
Why are you suddenly remembering
everything I've ever told you?

10:52.751 --> 10:55.586
'cause suddenly
it's coming in very handy.

10:57.756 --> 11:00.058
Tim...

11:00.059 --> 11:03.928
Being a responsible parent
has come back to bite me
in the butt.

11:05.364 --> 11:07.532
Well, I warned you
from day one.

11:07.533 --> 11:09.267
So, did you get
the sets up?

11:09.268 --> 11:11.602
Yes. No thanks
to the biology teacher.

11:11.603 --> 11:16.407
She said all the hammering
is making her frogs bounce.

11:16.408 --> 11:20.010
Hey, romeo.
How's the new director?

11:20.011 --> 11:22.846
Well, let me put it this way.
Five minutes after he arrived,

11:22.847 --> 11:25.716
I became a radish
and got hugged
by a giant potato.

11:29.288 --> 11:31.422
What is this?
Dinner theater?

11:31.423 --> 11:33.524
What are you
talking about?

11:33.525 --> 11:36.694
Wilson had us doing
all these stupid acting
exercises.

11:36.695 --> 11:40.498
Oh! Oh, honey, that's just,
you know, to loosen you guys up.

11:40.499 --> 11:42.133
The kids hate it.
And they're blaming me.

11:42.134 --> 11:43.901
If this keeps up,
I'll quit.

11:43.902 --> 11:46.137
You can't quit.
You made a commitment.

11:46.138 --> 11:49.039
This is wilson's first day.
He just wants to make sure

11:49.040 --> 11:52.076
That you guys understand
the fundamentals of acting.

11:52.077 --> 11:54.078
We would've been
better off with dad.

11:54.079 --> 11:56.848
He never bothers
to understand anything.

11:59.284 --> 12:03.320
"good night, good night!
Parting is such sweet sorrow..."

12:03.321 --> 12:05.856
"sleep dwell upon thine eyes,
peace in thy breast."

12:05.857 --> 12:08.058
Cease, my young players.

12:11.096 --> 12:13.964
Your performances
were much better
this time.

12:13.965 --> 12:16.534
Sharon, did you do
something different?

12:16.535 --> 12:19.837
I took out my retainer.

12:19.838 --> 12:22.039
And you, randy? Did you
do something different?

12:22.040 --> 12:26.344
I got in touch
with my inner radish.

12:26.345 --> 12:29.847
Well, your performance
was very, very crisp.

12:29.848 --> 12:31.215
<i>(chuckles)</i>

12:34.520 --> 12:36.754
But there's always
room for improvement.
So go home.

12:36.755 --> 12:40.057
And tomorrow morning,
I want you to bring
in a kitchen utensil

12:40.058 --> 12:43.026
That best personifies
your character. Dismissed.

12:46.965 --> 12:48.699
A kitchen utensil?

12:48.700 --> 12:49.867
Nice going, randy.

12:49.868 --> 12:52.336
Hey! I just tried
to get us a new director.

12:52.337 --> 12:56.507
I never thought he'd turn the
play into <i>romeo and julia child.</i>

12:56.508 --> 12:58.475
All right,
yeah, yeah, yeah!

12:58.476 --> 13:00.945
Set it right down there.
Thank you, dave.

13:05.283 --> 13:10.388
Well, I'm putting the finishing
touches on the aluminum set.
What do you think?

13:10.389 --> 13:13.724
Well, I'm thinking
I won't be able to use this set.

13:13.725 --> 13:15.526
Huh?

13:15.527 --> 13:20.230
Tim, the suburban
interpretation -
it's all wrong.

13:20.231 --> 13:22.900
Why not just give juliet
a three-car garage?

13:22.901 --> 13:25.802
I see it. If we're
gonna go with this,
three-car garage.

13:25.803 --> 13:30.741
She's italian. Doesn't
want to get the ferraris
rained on. I like it!

13:30.742 --> 13:34.478
Tim, the sets
have to fit <i>my</i> vision.

13:34.479 --> 13:37.547
<i>Pardonnez-moi.</i>

13:37.548 --> 13:40.885
I happen to be
the set designer.

13:40.886 --> 13:43.754
And I am the director.

13:43.755 --> 13:48.926
I understand. But I'm not some
schlocky subcontractor off the
street. I'm an artiste.

13:48.927 --> 13:52.763
Oh, tim, tim. While I respect
your opinion, you are primarily
a tool show host.

13:52.764 --> 13:54.699
You have no background
in the theater.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.466
<i>Au contraire.</i>

13:56.467 --> 13:59.903
In high school,
I designed the entire
<i>streetcar named desire</i> set.

13:59.904 --> 14:04.475
And I used tuck 'n' roll
leather. And I put a big-block
in a streetcar. Ha!

14:04.476 --> 14:07.144
It is my job to shape
this play as I see fit

14:07.145 --> 14:08.613
And protect its integrity.

14:08.614 --> 14:10.648
I say we have to
change the sets.

14:10.649 --> 14:12.916
You want me
to build new sets?
I'm afraid so, tim.

14:12.917 --> 14:16.186
And please, please,
please think 14th century.

14:16.187 --> 14:20.825
I have to reprimand the
costumer. She's got juliet in
a bodice from the 15th century.

14:20.826 --> 14:23.561
Oh, horrors!

14:25.264 --> 14:29.367
Do I detect a note
of sarcasm?
Maybe.

14:29.368 --> 14:32.169
I've spent three weeks on these.
I won't build new ones!

14:32.170 --> 14:34.438
As your director,
I insist you do!

14:34.439 --> 14:36.573
Really?
Really.

14:36.574 --> 14:40.143
Well, as your set designer,
forget about it.
Because I quit!

14:40.144 --> 14:43.147
Well, fine, fine,
fine, fine!
Fine, fine, fine!

14:43.148 --> 14:46.517
You'll never work
in this town again!

14:54.292 --> 14:55.759
Done.

14:58.396 --> 15:01.365
Save.

15:01.366 --> 15:03.834
Freedom!

15:03.835 --> 15:06.270
Freedom! Ah!

15:06.271 --> 15:08.305
Freedom! Ah!

15:08.306 --> 15:10.107
Freedom!

15:16.315 --> 15:18.582
Right there
is a perfect example

15:18.583 --> 15:22.987
Of why kids don't want
to be seen in public
with their parents.

15:22.988 --> 15:27.792
I... I just finished my paper,
brad. I was celebrating!

15:27.793 --> 15:30.695
Great. Now you can help me
with my english essay.

15:30.696 --> 15:34.065
What's the assignment?
Write about two
english authors.

15:34.066 --> 15:37.735
Which ones?
I have to compare
chaucer to bacon.

15:37.736 --> 15:40.871
Chaucer to bacon.
Chaucer to bacon.

15:40.872 --> 15:44.809
No contest.
Chaucer has much less fat.

15:44.810 --> 15:47.578
Yeah. I'll be up
in a minute.
Great.

15:47.579 --> 15:50.081
So, how'd it go
at school?
Terrible.

15:50.082 --> 15:52.583
Wilson wants me
to build new sets.

15:52.584 --> 15:55.953
Are you serious? After all
the work you've done already?

15:55.954 --> 15:58.089
They say you can
lead a horse to aluminum,

15:58.090 --> 16:00.891
But you can't force
italians into a garage.

16:06.298 --> 16:10.167
I'm sorry that you and randy
are having such
a bad experience.

16:10.168 --> 16:13.371
It's worse for randy
because I quit.

16:13.372 --> 16:14.638
What do you mean you quit?

16:14.639 --> 16:16.707
Wilson treated me
like I was a nobody.

16:16.708 --> 16:18.809
He doesn't realize
I'm an artiste.

16:18.810 --> 16:21.378
It's a well-kept secret.

16:23.147 --> 16:26.550
You can't quit after we told
randy that he couldn't quit!

16:26.551 --> 16:29.754
We never told him
I couldn't quit.

16:29.755 --> 16:33.324
Ok. You tell him why it's ok
for you to quit but not for him.

16:33.325 --> 16:35.459
Gotta admit
it's not gonna be easy.

16:35.460 --> 16:37.728
Hey, dad,
I heard you quit.

16:38.830 --> 16:40.965
Easier than I thought!

16:44.535 --> 16:47.538
This is totally unfair.
How come you get to quit
and I don't?

16:47.539 --> 16:51.642
Because I'm an adult.
We can do a lot of things
you can't do.

16:51.643 --> 16:54.044
We can drive,
we can vote...

16:54.045 --> 16:56.781
And we can quit.

16:56.782 --> 16:58.582
That's not fair!

16:58.583 --> 17:00.851
Yeah, you're right.

17:00.852 --> 17:03.620
You kids should
be able to vote.

17:05.824 --> 17:07.891
I knew this play
was a tragedy.

17:07.892 --> 17:10.926
I didn't think my life
would turn into one.

17:13.364 --> 17:18.002
That was real good, tim.
Made him feel a lot better.

17:18.002 --> 17:20.637
What are you
gonna do now?
Mm.

17:24.541 --> 17:27.077
Go talk to wilson.

17:29.314 --> 17:32.049
You out here, wilson?

17:32.050 --> 17:34.551
Yes, I am, tim,
but I am kind of busy.

17:34.552 --> 17:38.855
Thanks to you, I'm not only
the play's director,
I'm also the set designer,

17:38.856 --> 17:41.692
Along with many other jobs
too numerous to mention.

17:41.693 --> 17:44.895
We should talk about
what happened with
you and me today.

17:44.896 --> 17:46.430
Oh, that's all right,
neighbor.

17:46.431 --> 17:49.500
It was just that
our visions clashed.

17:49.501 --> 17:51.802
Happens all the time
in the theater.

17:51.803 --> 17:54.672
Happened with the costumer.

17:57.375 --> 18:00.578
You know, it's not easy
firing an eighth grader.

18:02.881 --> 18:05.382
You fired
little susie harris?

18:07.518 --> 18:09.586
Well, tim, I had to.

18:09.587 --> 18:12.790
A montague would never
wear this to a capulet's ball.

18:12.791 --> 18:16.160
Wilson, don't you see
what's happening here?
You're driving everybody crazy.

18:16.161 --> 18:18.496
I am?

18:18.497 --> 18:19.863
I can't believe
I'm even saying this.

18:19.864 --> 18:22.999
But you're taking all the fun
out of shakespeare.

18:26.871 --> 18:30.007
But my only aim
was to put on
a quality production.

18:30.008 --> 18:32.676
I know that. And...

18:32.677 --> 18:35.011
There might not be
a production at all.

18:35.012 --> 18:36.813
A lot of kids
are thinking of quitting.

18:36.814 --> 18:39.149
They are?
Yeah. Juliet, romeo...

18:39.150 --> 18:41.685
Cappuccino,
montezuma,
everybody.

18:41.686 --> 18:44.521
Well, I had no idea.

18:45.890 --> 18:48.358
You're obsessed with this.
You gotta lighten up.

18:48.359 --> 18:50.894
I'm not sure
I can do that.
Well, why not?

18:50.895 --> 18:52.462
Because when I
take on a task,

18:52.463 --> 18:57.300
It's always my nature to strive
for authenticity and perfection.

18:57.301 --> 18:59.503
You know,
this brings to mind

18:59.504 --> 19:01.839
Another great
20th-century thinker.

19:01.840 --> 19:03.974
Einstein?
Me.

19:03.975 --> 19:08.311
When I first started <i>tool time,</i>
I was so obsessed with every
speck and detail

19:08.312 --> 19:10.147
That people got
fed up with me.

19:10.148 --> 19:14.618
So, what did you do?
Well, I hired al
to be the boring one.

19:14.619 --> 19:16.520
Which worked out
very well.

19:16.521 --> 19:18.355
I realized I had
a higher purpose -

19:18.356 --> 19:23.294
To make tool usage
more accessible
to the common man.

19:23.295 --> 19:28.465
So, you're saying I should make
shakespeare more accessible
to the students.

19:28.466 --> 19:30.767
If you blow it
with these kids,

19:30.768 --> 19:33.203
They might learn
to hate the theater.

19:33.204 --> 19:37.474
Then there would be a whole new
generation of people like me.

19:37.475 --> 19:39.743
<i>(imitating tim)</i> oh, no.
I don't want that.

19:45.216 --> 19:46.883
Hey, what's going on?

19:46.884 --> 19:49.953
We're talking about
how we can get rid of wilson.

19:49.954 --> 19:53.557
If we get rid of him,
who's gonna direct?
My dad.

19:53.558 --> 19:57.895
Your dad's gonna direct?
He's a plumber.

19:57.896 --> 20:00.864
Well, greetings,
my teenage troupe.

20:00.865 --> 20:03.534
Does everybody have
your kitchen utensil?

20:03.535 --> 20:05.302
Yeah.

20:05.303 --> 20:09.506
I want you to bring them over
here and toss them in this box.

20:09.507 --> 20:11.742
And then I want you
to forget about them.

20:11.743 --> 20:14.078
Wilson, you're not
making any sense.

20:14.079 --> 20:16.480
Your father told me that
my overzealous pedagogy

20:16.481 --> 20:19.282
Would only extinguish
your elizabethan exuberance.

20:22.553 --> 20:25.522
My dad said that?

20:25.523 --> 20:29.493
Actually, he said
I was being a jackass.
That's dad.

20:29.494 --> 20:31.528
Does this mean we're
rehearsing today?

20:31.529 --> 20:34.865
Yes. No analysis,
no interpretation.

20:34.866 --> 20:39.136
Just good old wacky
shakespearean fun.
Yeah!

20:39.137 --> 20:43.607
Start at the love scene
featuring one of the greatest
juliets to grace the stage,

20:43.608 --> 20:45.442
Miss sharon liebowitz.

20:45.443 --> 20:48.545
Well, this might not
be so bad after all.

20:48.546 --> 20:51.214
Well, I told you romeo
would never let you down.

20:51.215 --> 20:54.918
I might have to hug you again.
I might have to let you.

20:54.919 --> 20:57.854
I might have to hug you again.
I might have to pass.

21:11.670 --> 21:14.838
Dad! He's a little big.
You think romeo can take him?

21:14.839 --> 21:16.407
Shh!

21:16.408 --> 21:18.074
<i>(grunts)</i>

21:18.075 --> 21:20.910
"o, I am slain!"

21:20.911 --> 21:23.180
<i>(thud)</i>

21:23.181 --> 21:26.349
I never thought I'd get
such a kick out of shakespeare.

21:26.350 --> 21:29.719
It's all the aluminum.

21:29.720 --> 21:31.889
I think wilson
helped a little.

21:31.890 --> 21:33.056
Shh!

21:33.057 --> 21:34.258
What happened to juliet?

21:34.259 --> 21:35.959
Just wait,
just wait,
just wait.

21:40.297 --> 21:42.533
"o my love! My wife!

21:42.534 --> 21:45.302
Death hath suck'd
the honey of thy breath..."

21:45.303 --> 21:48.805
Do you get the symbolism
of the crypt rising to romeo?

21:48.806 --> 21:50.907
Yeah, yeah.
It's real interesting.

21:55.313 --> 21:59.149
What's the symbolism
of the crypt rising
to the ceiling?

21:59.150 --> 22:01.417
Dad, what do I do now?

22:01.418 --> 22:03.286
Uh, um...

22:03.287 --> 22:06.289
Just hold on. Don't look down.
You'll throw up!

22:09.694 --> 22:13.163
<i>Pardonnez-moi.</i>
But I am the set designer.

22:13.164 --> 22:16.066
And I am the...
Let's do it again.

22:16.067 --> 22:19.770
Yeah!

22:19.771 --> 22:25.042
<i>Pardonnez-moi.</i>
I am the set designer.

22:25.043 --> 22:27.510
And I am the director!

22:29.881 --> 22:32.249
Oh, that's not
close enough.

22:32.250 --> 22:36.854
<i>Pardonnez-moi.</i>
I am the set designer!

22:36.855 --> 22:41.291
And I am the director!

22:41.292 --> 22:44.728
Bigger! Bigger!
Sell it!

22:45.797 --> 22:48.498
"director!"

22:52.070 --> 22:55.338
Maybe I shouldn't
get so big.
