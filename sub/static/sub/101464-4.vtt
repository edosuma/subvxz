00:11.010 --> 00:13.763

00:36.995 --> 00:39.247
[thudding]

00:40.290 --> 00:45.462
[roars, screeches]

00:55.513 --> 00:58.641
[Darius] Seriously, Dad,
you got to see this!

01:00.060 --> 01:00.977
[chuckles]

01:01.061 --> 01:02.145
Slow down, kiddo!

01:02.228 --> 01:04.898
One day, I might need to use
this hand again.

01:04.981 --> 01:07.484
Someone just posted
Dr. Grant's latest article

01:07.567 --> 01:09.486
to the Jurassic World forums,

01:09.569 --> 01:11.988
and apparently,
it says there's all this new evidence

01:12.072 --> 01:14.574
of craniofacial biting in theropods!

01:14.657 --> 01:17.243
Well, that would mean theropods
didn't just fight to kill,

01:17.327 --> 01:19.913
they fought for dominance,
for power, and--

01:19.996 --> 01:21.831
And even for fun!

01:21.915 --> 01:25.710
-Uh, it's... it's the next paragraph down.
-Darius, let your old man read.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.755
-[giggling]
-I sacrificed a hand for this.

01:28.838 --> 01:33.718
I mean, can you imagine two T. rex
battling each other? [roars]

01:33.802 --> 01:37.555
I mean, I can't even wait to see
one T. rex at Jurassic World.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.891
Oh, we'll be there soon enough, kiddo.

01:39.974 --> 01:42.018
Then we'll see all these big guys
for real.

01:42.268 --> 01:44.395
[giggling]

01:44.479 --> 01:47.690
Okay, I was gonna wait till later
to give you this,

01:47.982 --> 01:51.611
but no time like the present
for a present. Dun-dun!

01:51.694 --> 01:54.364
-[chuckles]
-Ain't no pun like a Dad pun.

01:56.908 --> 01:58.034
[gasps]

01:58.660 --> 01:59.494
Wow!

02:00.245 --> 02:02.080
Matching raptor teeth?

02:03.998 --> 02:04.833
[gasps]

02:08.920 --> 02:12.507
This is so freaking cool!

02:18.179 --> 02:19.097
[clears throat]

02:19.180 --> 02:21.057
Uh, are you okay?

02:21.141 --> 02:23.726
I'm fine, just a little tired.

02:24.853 --> 02:26.938
Hey, come here.

02:27.564 --> 02:32.193
We're going to Jurassic World
and it's gonna be incredible,

02:32.277 --> 02:34.529
not just because of the dinosaurs,

02:34.612 --> 02:38.575
because it'll be the two of us there,
together.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.327
I promise.

02:46.624 --> 02:49.335
[birds, insects chirping]

02:55.383 --> 02:58.386
[helicopter blades whirring]

03:09.689 --> 03:13.192
And despite the park's owner
Mr. Masrani just now arriving,

03:13.276 --> 03:16.613
we have something that we urgently need
to discuss with you, Ms. Dearing.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.740
-You see-- Shh!
-Don't forget about the raptor pen.

03:18.823 --> 03:20.950
-I know, I know.
-Or the kids getting lost in the storm.

03:21.034 --> 03:21.868
The point is--

03:21.951 --> 03:24.746
-Or the stampede during the storm.
-Shush!

03:25.455 --> 03:28.166
The point is, Claire, uh, Ms. Dearing,

03:28.291 --> 03:31.586
uh, we know that Camp Cretaceous
is very important to Mr. Masrani,

03:31.669 --> 03:33.963
and that you were thinking of having
your nephews join us today,

03:34.047 --> 03:37.008
but we've had two serious incidents
over the last 48 hours.

03:37.091 --> 03:39.844
Dave and I need more staff immediately

03:39.928 --> 03:41.804
or we need to send the kids home ASAP.

03:41.888 --> 03:44.641
[voicemail] <i>The mailbox</i>
<i>you are trying to reach is full.</i>

03:44.724 --> 03:48.436
<i>-Please try again later.</i>
-[both] Ugh!

03:48.519 --> 03:50.813
New plan: we do this in person.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.315
Mm...

03:52.398 --> 03:56.444
I'm sorry, are you saying
we leave the kids here alone?

03:56.527 --> 03:57.445
Our kids?

03:57.820 --> 04:01.324
The kids who seem determined
to get themselves trampled and/or eaten?

04:01.407 --> 04:02.867
Those are the kids of which you speak?

04:04.369 --> 04:05.203
We won't be gone long.

04:05.286 --> 04:08.248
If we leave now, we can be back
in an hour or two, tops.

04:08.748 --> 04:11.751
-[scoffs] I'll leave a note.
-[engine starts]

04:16.339 --> 04:17.840
What up, Camp Cretaceous?

04:18.216 --> 04:19.425
-Whoo-hoo!
-[Ben slurps]

04:19.926 --> 04:23.846
Not in a "whoo-hoo" mood this morning,
Darius.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.265
Not after yesterday.

04:25.348 --> 04:28.309
Trekking through a rainstorm will do that.

04:29.102 --> 04:34.065
We only had to walk because you crashed
our gyrosphere. [slurps]

04:34.649 --> 04:35.608
[growls]

04:36.067 --> 04:37.151
Mm!

04:37.235 --> 04:40.196
But today's a new day! Kayak Day!

04:40.280 --> 04:45.243
Who doesn't wanna paddle
alongside dinosaurs, real dinosaurs?

04:45.326 --> 04:47.620
It's gonna be awesome, right?

04:48.579 --> 04:50.707
Wait, where are Dave and Roxie?

04:51.416 --> 04:55.545
The babysitters took off early
and left this.

04:56.337 --> 05:01.175
"BRB. Gotta go. Boss-talk. BB. Later.
Smiley face."

05:01.551 --> 05:04.429
Is that a dinosaur emoji
with a thumbs up?

05:04.512 --> 05:08.057
It's Dave speak.
Roxie translated on the back.

05:08.141 --> 05:11.602
"We have to go talk to our boss.
Stay inside until we return.

05:11.686 --> 05:13.313
Draw, bond, whatever.

05:13.396 --> 05:16.441
The radio's set for channel six
in case you need us.

05:16.524 --> 05:18.901
Stay inside, stay inside.

05:18.985 --> 05:21.946
Do not leave, Kenji, looking at you."
[chuckles]

05:22.405 --> 05:25.199
Uh... "Sorry for the kids' menus,
it's all Dave had."

05:25.283 --> 05:26.743
[Kenji] Do they understand how old we are?

05:26.909 --> 05:30.246
I mean, when was the last time
you even saw a crayon?

05:33.124 --> 05:34.667
Hmm. I have notes.

05:35.043 --> 05:37.337
-Yasmina! [gasps]
-[thud]

05:38.963 --> 05:41.716
Brooklynn. What's new on the Internet,
superstar?

05:42.258 --> 05:44.260
I wouldn't know

05:44.343 --> 05:48.014
because when I went to get my phone
from its charger, it wasn't there!

05:48.097 --> 05:50.224
Someone stole my phone.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.393
Brooklynn, who hasn't had your phone?

05:52.477 --> 05:54.312
I needed to check the weather
last night...

05:54.395 --> 05:57.106
Dr. Sattler posted a new column
on microfossils yesterday...

05:57.190 --> 06:01.277
...too good to miss the selfie opp,
but I haven't used it since then, I swear!

06:01.444 --> 06:02.779
[scoffs]

06:03.696 --> 06:06.657
I... haven't seen it either.

06:07.033 --> 06:09.077
-Really?
-Hey, hey, it's okay!

06:09.160 --> 06:10.995
Since we're not kayaking till later,

06:11.079 --> 06:13.039
we'll have plenty of time
to look for the phone.

06:13.122 --> 06:16.334
Oh, I think I know exactly where to look.

06:16.417 --> 06:18.628
I also think that whoever took the phone

06:18.711 --> 06:21.297
might be trying to hide some of the things
that are on it.

06:21.380 --> 06:24.133
What do you think, Sammy?

06:24.217 --> 06:25.384
Um, what?

06:26.052 --> 06:28.846
What is your deal?
Sammy said she didn't touch it!

06:28.971 --> 06:31.724
Ever think you might have just lost
the stupid thing?

06:31.808 --> 06:35.061
Hmm. Well, then, let's check her bags
and test that theory out.

06:35.144 --> 06:37.313
You do not get to go through
anyone's stuff,

06:37.647 --> 06:39.440
I don't care how famous you think you are!

06:39.524 --> 06:43.361
-Brooklynn, I did not--
-Brooklynn, guys, come on!

06:43.736 --> 06:46.030
We can't be this upset over phones.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.950
Let's make the most
of this incredible opportunity!

06:49.033 --> 06:52.995
-This is Jurassic World! It's-- It's--
-[dinosaur roars]

06:56.666 --> 06:57.792
What was that?

06:57.875 --> 07:01.671
-Um, a T. rex?
-Mm-mm. I don't think so.

07:01.754 --> 07:04.215
[Ben] Then what sort of dinosaur
did it sound like?

07:04.549 --> 07:06.759
Friend-ish? Or foe-ish?

07:07.802 --> 07:08.970
Where's it comin' from?

07:09.387 --> 07:12.849
Can't see anything from here.
The trees are blocking everything.

07:12.974 --> 07:15.309
Maybe they're moving a new dino
from the lab to another enclosure.

07:15.977 --> 07:19.897
[gasps] We could probably see it
from the observation tower! Could be cool.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.985
[gasps] Wow, that's a great idea, Darius!
What are we waiting for?

07:24.610 --> 07:27.697
[Brooklynn] Hey, we're not done talking
about this yet!

07:27.780 --> 07:30.867
But, guys,
it's Indoor Arts and Crafts Day!

07:31.159 --> 07:33.911
We should stay and wait for Dave
and Roxie, right, Kenji?

07:33.995 --> 07:37.623
If you wanna stay here and draw you
and your dino-crush, go for it.

07:37.707 --> 07:39.959
I'm gonna go see me a T. rex
or a girl-fight.

07:40.042 --> 07:42.753
Either way, I win. Ka-ching!

07:44.046 --> 07:47.467
Fine, go on! I'll just stay
where we're supposed to stay,

07:47.550 --> 07:49.927
wait for who we're supposed to wait for,

07:50.011 --> 07:52.805
and be right where we're supposed to be.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.187
[whimpers]

07:59.937 --> 08:00.771
[exhales]

08:01.189 --> 08:04.692

-It's locked!
-Oh, wow. Guess we can't get in.

08:25.796 --> 08:28.716
We should all go back before someone
comes along and we get in trouble.

08:28.799 --> 08:32.178
-[chuckles nervously]
-Wait, where is everybody?

08:33.721 --> 08:36.098
Uh, there's usually someone around.

08:36.557 --> 08:38.100
If we're doing this...

08:40.102 --> 08:42.271
then we might as well do this.

08:42.855 --> 08:43.940
Ta-da!

08:46.734 --> 08:49.445
What? You didn't see
my "Unboxing Kathmandu" video,

08:49.529 --> 08:51.948
"Hacks For When You Lock Yourself Out
Of Your Hotel Room"?

08:52.365 --> 08:54.659
Last to the top is a rotten egg!

08:55.576 --> 08:57.078
[Yasmina] Later, rotten egg.

09:01.249 --> 09:03.709
[Sammy panting]

09:03.793 --> 09:04.710
Is anybody else hot?

It is hot.

-It's just a brachiosaurus.

10:04.312 --> 10:08.024
Ooh! Mystery solved.
Guess we should head back now.

10:08.316 --> 10:11.736
But that doesn't make any sense.
Brachiosauruses don't roar like that.

10:11.819 --> 10:15.531
They're more like... [imitates bellowing]

doin' outside?

10:22.163 --> 10:23.664

-What are they saying?
-[man 2] You can't be up there!

10:26.834 --> 10:30.129
Oh, great! They look mad.
I told you we'd get in trouble.

10:30.212 --> 10:32.465

You need to get down now!

-There was a dinosaur. In--
-[whispers] Indominus Rex.

How do you know that name?

11:11.337 --> 11:14.131
-But there's no dinosaur named--
-There's no time. We need to leave.

13:10.789 --> 13:14.001
You're strong?
Like, really, really strong?

13:16.545 --> 13:18.506
What are you doing?

13:20.257 --> 13:23.469
[exhales] Catch me! [yells, grunts]

13:23.719 --> 13:25.012
Whoa!

13:28.140 --> 13:29.683
[grunting]

13:30.184 --> 13:32.520
It's working. It's working!

13:33.229 --> 13:34.480
[roars]

13:45.741 --> 13:47.826
[all screaming]

13:50.746 --> 13:51.956
[thudding]

13:52.748 --> 13:55.793
[heart monitor beeping]

14:08.305 --> 14:10.140
Hey, Dad. [chuckles]

14:12.476 --> 14:13.310
You won't believe it,

14:13.394 --> 14:16.063
but there are all these rumors online
that Jurassic World

14:16.146 --> 14:18.649
will announce a new dinosaur
by the end of the year!

14:18.941 --> 14:21.235
[chuckles] Oh, really?

14:21.569 --> 14:23.237
What do you think it'll be?

14:23.654 --> 14:25.990
Maybe they'll finally make an anchiornis.

14:26.115 --> 14:29.743
Or maybe a carnotaurus. Heh!

14:30.786 --> 14:32.830
Dad, they've already got that.

14:33.080 --> 14:37.209
And whatever you do,
do not ask me if I'm "carno-sure-us."

14:37.668 --> 14:38.836
[chuckles]

14:42.464 --> 14:43.799
Of course.

14:44.216 --> 14:45.259
You're right.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.011
You really do know it all.

14:50.431 --> 14:51.891
Not everything.

14:52.433 --> 14:55.144
That's why this Jurassic World trip
is gonna be awesome.

14:55.227 --> 14:58.439
And we're going in May
when they're doing all the hatchery tours!

14:58.522 --> 15:00.941
-Darius--
-I've planned the whole thing out.

15:01.442 --> 15:04.194
Where the lines are short
so you won't get too tired,

15:04.278 --> 15:06.697
where there are benches
for you to take breaks--

15:06.780 --> 15:08.866
D-Man, about the trip...

15:08.949 --> 15:09.909
Dad.

15:10.367 --> 15:11.535
Don't say it.

15:12.244 --> 15:14.496
You're gonna get better.
You have to get better.

15:15.414 --> 15:17.583
I-- I need you to get better.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.669
[Dad] I'm tryin', son.

15:21.670 --> 15:24.340
There's a lot of things
we were supposed to do together.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.509
So many things.

15:28.218 --> 15:30.137
That we can still do.

15:30.888 --> 15:32.139
Listen to me.

15:32.806 --> 15:36.435
This life, it doesn't always go your way.

15:37.353 --> 15:38.938
Things fall apart.

15:40.272 --> 15:44.902
But what matters is how you choose
to keep moving forward.

15:46.111 --> 15:50.699
What matters is that you keep goin'

15:51.617 --> 15:53.744
for the people who need you most.

15:54.244 --> 15:58.666
That's... that's the promise we make
every day we get.

16:00.542 --> 16:04.046
That despite all the hardships...

16:06.840 --> 16:08.509
you never give up.

16:12.388 --> 16:13.806
Then you aren't either.

16:14.431 --> 16:15.975
We're doing this together.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.727
No more "dad speeches," okay?

16:19.395 --> 16:21.605
Heh. Fair enough.

16:22.648 --> 16:23.732
[sighs]

16:23.816 --> 16:26.402
I should know better
than to argue with you.

16:27.653 --> 16:28.904
You'll see, Dad.

16:29.488 --> 16:32.908
We're gonna make it to Jurassic World
and it's gonna be perfect.

16:36.495 --> 16:37.705
It has to be.

16:41.333 --> 16:44.336
[heart monitor beeping echoes]

16:50.426 --> 16:51.301
[grunts]

16:52.428 --> 16:53.387
[groans]

16:54.054 --> 16:55.723
[inhales, gasps]

16:56.056 --> 16:57.599
-[Ben] Oh, ow.
-[Brooklynn grunts]

16:57.683 --> 17:00.310
-Are you okay?
-[all groaning]

17:00.894 --> 17:02.563
-[Kenji grunts]
-[roaring]

17:02.646 --> 17:04.189
Where the heck is that thing?

17:06.817 --> 17:08.902
[whimpers] It's coming.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.697
Shh! It could be anywhere.

17:12.322 --> 17:17.953
The observation tower was that way?
Or was it that way? I... [sighs]

17:18.704 --> 17:22.291
Okay, I'm sorry, but I--

17:22.416 --> 17:23.375
[gasps]

17:28.088 --> 17:30.049
[gasps] Where's-- No, no.

17:30.215 --> 17:32.468
My necklace, I left it in my bunk!

17:32.551 --> 17:33.761
-[roaring]
-[all gasp]

17:33.844 --> 17:35.804
We've got slightly bigger problems than--

17:37.598 --> 17:40.100
We have to run. Now!

17:40.642 --> 17:41.727
[all panting]

17:41.810 --> 17:43.812
Everything will be fine
when we get back to camp.

17:44.938 --> 17:46.482
Ah! [pants]

17:52.404 --> 17:53.363
Faster!

17:56.784 --> 17:57.659
[gasps]

18:06.835 --> 18:08.003
[all gasp]

18:21.183 --> 18:22.017
[Darius gasps]

18:31.235 --> 18:33.821
[creaking]

18:35.114 --> 18:38.075
Dave, Roxie, the other workers,

18:38.325 --> 18:40.244
they must've all gotten away.

18:45.916 --> 18:48.418
[gasps] Not all of them.

18:50.170 --> 18:51.046
[gasps]

18:56.176 --> 18:57.094
Hello?

18:57.719 --> 18:58.887
Hello!

18:59.012 --> 19:02.057
Can anybody--? [grunts]

19:02.766 --> 19:03.934
[sighs]

19:04.893 --> 19:06.186
We're on our own.

19:17.364 --> 19:20.242
-Give me my phone!
-What?

19:20.325 --> 19:23.203
I don't care about you
sneaking into Dr. Wu's lab,

19:23.412 --> 19:24.997
I don't care about whatever you did

19:25.080 --> 19:27.916
with the skin samples you took
from the sinoceratops--

19:28.250 --> 19:29.668
-What?
-What skin samples?

19:29.751 --> 19:32.713
-What were you doing in Dr. Wu's lab?
-I don't even care that you stole it now.

19:32.796 --> 19:35.799
All I wanna do is call for help!
Where is it?

19:36.133 --> 19:38.051
Uh, I...

19:38.844 --> 19:39.678
[Sammy whimpers]

19:41.513 --> 19:42.347
I...

19:44.641 --> 19:46.268
I don't know what you're talkin' about!

19:46.351 --> 19:49.229
Skin samples? Sneaking into labs?

19:49.313 --> 19:51.565
You made up some crazy thing
in your own dang head!

19:51.648 --> 19:52.608
Hey, back off.

19:52.691 --> 19:55.277
Not everything revolves around you
and your phone!

19:55.694 --> 19:58.322
It isn't Sammy's fault you lost it!

19:58.780 --> 20:01.033
Would you guys please keep it down?!

20:01.116 --> 20:03.994
-There's a big--
-A big, scary dinosaur?

20:04.119 --> 20:06.830
Of course there's a big, scary dinosaur!

20:06.914 --> 20:08.916
There's always a big, scary dinosaur!

20:08.999 --> 20:11.043
And you're always a big-mouthed jerk!

20:11.210 --> 20:13.295
-Give it back!
-Back off!

20:13.462 --> 20:15.464
Yeah? Well, at least I don't play
with crayons!

20:15.589 --> 20:17.466
What is your problem with me?

20:17.549 --> 20:18.592
I'm trying to get us,

20:18.675 --> 20:21.136
-all of us out of this mess!
-My necklace. No.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.013
-[Sammy] I didn't lie to you about it!
-[creaking]

20:23.263 --> 20:25.933
-[Brooklynn] Just stop!
-[Ben] Money's not gonna help any of us!

20:26.016 --> 20:28.685
No one is getting out of here! [pants]

20:28.769 --> 20:30.437
We just saw people get eaten!

20:31.021 --> 20:33.315
We're alone, we're defenseless.

20:34.983 --> 20:35.943
We're dead.

20:37.819 --> 20:39.863
-[all scoff]
-I can't believe this.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.376
[Darius] We're not giving up!

20:56.630 --> 20:59.132
I get it. It's scary.

20:59.549 --> 21:02.552
This wasn't how it was supposed to be.

21:03.845 --> 21:06.181
Things aren't always gonna go your way.

21:06.598 --> 21:09.768
Life is messy and sometimes...

21:10.644 --> 21:12.229
things fall apart.

21:12.604 --> 21:13.605
But that's okay

21:13.689 --> 21:17.526
because when that happens,
we pick up the pieces and keep going.

21:17.943 --> 21:19.861
And we never give up.

21:22.489 --> 21:25.409
-What about your necklace?
-It's not important.

21:25.617 --> 21:27.327
I've got the memories right here.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.579
What are we supposed to do?

21:29.871 --> 21:32.332
[Darius] Get south to the park. Get help.

21:32.499 --> 21:35.085
And the only way we'll make it
is if we do it together.

21:35.252 --> 21:37.671
We're a team or we're nothing at all.

21:38.297 --> 21:41.341
Or, you know, we don't go back
into the jungle.

21:41.425 --> 21:43.760
You can wait
for the negligent babysitters,

21:43.844 --> 21:44.886
but I'm with Darius.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.430
Wait, really?

21:46.513 --> 21:49.308
Dude, there's no way I survived
a dinosaur attack...

21:49.391 --> 21:50.976
-[grunts]
-Wah!

21:51.059 --> 21:53.228
...just to be taken out
by cheap camp debris.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.105
Kenji ain't goin' out like that.

21:55.731 --> 21:58.442
We're going south.
The rest of you coming or what?

22:00.777 --> 22:01.695
I'm in.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.197
We're in, too.

22:09.244 --> 22:10.287
[Ben] Um, but guys?

22:11.913 --> 22:12.748
[gasps]

22:13.790 --> 22:14.708
[sighs]

22:14.833 --> 22:18.378
It's just one dinosaur.
It's just one dinosaur.

22:18.962 --> 22:22.341
It's just one dinosaur.
It's just one dinosaur.

22:22.674 --> 22:25.218
[snarling]

22:34.978 --> 22:36.521
[roars]

22:37.314 --> 22:42.277
[roars]

22:42.360 --> 22:44.780
[theme music playing]
