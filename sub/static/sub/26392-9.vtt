Dude, who cares what
these trolls think?

09:48.239 --> 09:49.501
They're not even
that funny.

09:49.545 --> 09:51.547
[suppressed laugh]

09:51.591 --> 09:54.419
I do. My crew has been telling
me I'm so great for years,

09:54.463 --> 09:57.422
but it turns out a ton
of people don't think that.Oh, look, Cooper,

09:57.466 --> 09:58.772
you just need to take a break.

09:58.815 --> 10:00.556
All this negativity
is messing with your head.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.818
JAKE:
It is, man.
She's right.

10:01.862 --> 10:03.646
I mean, you're normally
such a positive guy.

10:03.690 --> 10:06.431
Maybe just try to unplug
for a bit, you know?

10:06.475 --> 10:08.216
Just, uh, take
a weekend hiatus,

10:08.259 --> 10:10.479
and by Monday, you'll be ready
to finish your book tour.

10:10.522 --> 10:12.307
Unplug?Yeah.

10:12.350 --> 10:15.049
Yeah, that actually makes
a lot of sense.

10:15.092 --> 10:17.573
Yeah, thanks, guys.Yeah.

10:17.617 --> 10:18.618
[groans]

10:18.661 --> 10:20.532
I feel so bad for Cooper.

10:20.576 --> 10:21.751
Yeah, me, too.

10:21.795 --> 10:23.318
But he made $10,000

10:23.361 --> 10:26.190
just by existing today,
so I think he'll be okay.

10:34.546 --> 10:36.461
Okay, so I revised
my presentation,

10:36.505 --> 10:39.029
and I need you to tell me
how great it is no matter what.

10:39.073 --> 10:40.944
Just pretend like
you're one of Cooper's yes-men.

10:40.988 --> 10:42.424
[sighs]
Okay.

10:42.467 --> 10:44.644
You're amazing! [laughs]

10:45.949 --> 10:48.865
Can I borrow a Bitcoin
to fix my butt implants?

10:50.824 --> 10:53.304
All right, here we go.
[clears throat]

10:53.348 --> 10:55.437
Hey, guys. Uh...

10:55.480 --> 10:58.048
What?

10:58.092 --> 10:59.441
I didn't say anything.

10:59.484 --> 11:01.486
I know, but you're making
the same face you make

11:01.530 --> 11:05.186
whenever I pronounce bruschetta
"broosketa."

11:05.229 --> 11:09.581
It's just, "Hey, guys" sounds
like you're a youth group leader

11:09.625 --> 11:11.496
about to tell a story about
a cool carpenter who had

11:11.540 --> 11:13.673
a lot of crazy ideas.

11:15.413 --> 11:17.415
Hey, look who got
a good night's sleep.

11:17.459 --> 11:19.548
Yeah. Yeah,
I decided to

11:19.591 --> 11:21.202
take your advice
and really unplug.

11:21.245 --> 11:22.725
Ooh, you're gonna do
an acoustic show?

11:22.769 --> 11:25.467
You know, I play a mean
one of those large sticks

11:25.510 --> 11:27.730
with rice in it that
you have to keep turning over.

11:27.774 --> 11:29.732
[hissing rhythmically]

11:36.652 --> 11:38.915
No, I meant,
unplug from the world for a bit.

11:38.959 --> 11:40.482
Uh, I'm gonna cancel
my book tour.

11:40.525 --> 11:42.223
What?
Are you serious?

11:42.266 --> 11:43.615
Yeah. Yeah,
I've realized

11:43.659 --> 11:45.400
I'm approaching
the twilight years of my life.

11:45.443 --> 11:47.576
Well, hold on. [laughs]

11:47.619 --> 11:49.273
You're barely 20.

11:49.317 --> 11:52.624
I mean, we have sheets
that are older than you.

11:52.668 --> 11:54.104
Okay, gross, but...

11:54.148 --> 11:55.671
And-and, Cooper,
don't you have, like,

11:55.715 --> 11:57.629
a bunch of people
around the country

11:57.673 --> 11:59.806
who are excited to see you
on your book tour?

11:59.849 --> 12:02.634
Yeah, but I can't face 'em
like this.

12:02.678 --> 12:04.549
My critics are right,
and I'm so grateful

12:04.593 --> 12:06.160
to you guys
for finally opening my eyes.

12:06.203 --> 12:07.552
Come on, man!

12:07.596 --> 12:09.990
You can't do this, man!
You're too talented!

12:10.033 --> 12:11.208
CLAIRE:
Yeah!

12:11.252 --> 12:12.906
What the hell, Jake?
We just read this tweet

12:12.949 --> 12:15.473
from Cooper, said he's
"taking a career hiatus."

12:15.517 --> 12:18.302
You broke
our beautiful boy.

12:19.564 --> 12:23.351
And now who am I going
to brag about at bridge club?

12:23.394 --> 12:25.657
Me?

12:25.701 --> 12:27.224
[laughs]

12:27.268 --> 12:29.661
Right, Claire.

12:31.707 --> 12:33.491
All right, all right,
hey, hey, hey.

12:33.535 --> 12:35.624
Okay, all right, all right,
everybody calm down.

12:35.667 --> 12:38.105
All I did was accidentally
make Cooper realize

12:38.148 --> 12:39.323
he's surrounded by yes-men,

12:39.367 --> 12:40.716
and so, he went
in search for criticism,

12:40.760 --> 12:42.196
found so much
that he got depressed,

12:42.239 --> 12:43.501
and then stopped
doing what he loves.

12:43.545 --> 12:46.200
[high-pitched]:
That's not my fault. I didn't!

12:46.243 --> 12:47.549
That's not me. I...

12:47.592 --> 12:49.290
Oh, okay, okay.

12:49.333 --> 12:51.509
It's not my fault. I...Stop!

12:53.337 --> 12:55.513
We have to stop panicking.
All we have to do is just

12:55.557 --> 12:57.385
figure out how to get
Cooper back on track.

12:57.428 --> 12:59.648
Aah. If only there
was a way we could

12:59.691 --> 13:02.825
crack open Cooper's head and
read what was inside it.

13:02.869 --> 13:04.827
[scoffs]

13:04.871 --> 13:06.176
Oh, my gosh, Dad.

13:06.220 --> 13:07.961
That's a great idea!
We can read Cooper's book.

13:08.004 --> 13:10.790
Oh, yeah, he wrote a book.He did.

13:14.445 --> 13:16.578
Oh, man, I really thought

13:16.621 --> 13:18.841
Cooper's book was gonna
be lame celebrity drivel,

13:18.885 --> 13:20.800
but it's really good.

13:20.843 --> 13:23.585
I mean, this part about
his grandma-- it's so touching.

13:23.628 --> 13:26.631
[high-pitched]:
Mm-hmm.

13:27.676 --> 13:29.504
She taught him...

13:29.547 --> 13:31.375
how to post his...

13:32.202 --> 13:34.422
...first YouTube video.

13:35.553 --> 13:37.860
Wow, Jake,
you're really crying a lot,

13:37.904 --> 13:40.254
[voice breaking]:
you big baby.

13:40.297 --> 13:41.864
You're crying, too, Dad.

13:41.908 --> 13:43.605
No, I'm not.

13:43.648 --> 13:46.216
Look at Jake.
Jake's the one who's crying!

13:46.260 --> 13:48.653
BONNIE: Ooh, I've
got something.

13:48.697 --> 13:51.178
Everyone turn
to page 247.

13:51.221 --> 13:52.919
Mom, I really hope
you're not showing us

13:52.962 --> 13:55.486
that picture
of Cooper's butt again.

13:55.530 --> 13:58.315
All right, fine.
Turn to page 248.

13:59.926 --> 14:03.799
That's where he starts talking
about why he got into music.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.496
Dang, I'm only on chapter nine.

14:05.540 --> 14:06.933
How'd you get there so fast?

14:06.976 --> 14:08.717
Oh, I'm great at
speed reading.

14:16.812 --> 14:19.554
Okay, okay, listen to this.
Okay.

14:19.597 --> 14:22.687
"My mom was my first fan
and is still my biggest.

14:22.731 --> 14:25.560
"When I started out, I didn't
think I was good enough,

14:25.603 --> 14:29.781
and until I found my confidence,
I borrowed some of hers."

14:31.609 --> 14:34.917
[crying]: His mom was
his biggest fan.

14:34.961 --> 14:36.745
[phone chimes]

14:36.788 --> 14:38.834
Oh, crap.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.531
I have to go do my presentation.

14:40.575 --> 14:41.924
This is gonna be

14:41.968 --> 14:43.621
a frickin' disaster.

14:46.842 --> 14:49.584
Real nightmare.

14:51.586 --> 14:53.544
Here I go...

14:53.588 --> 14:55.590
all alone.

14:56.634 --> 14:58.114
Claire! Come on!
Seriously?!

14:58.158 --> 14:59.855
Okay. I'm sorry. Okay.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.075
While you're up there,
just remember,

15:02.118 --> 15:04.512
you are so good...

15:04.555 --> 15:07.428
at other things.

15:16.176 --> 15:18.221
Ugh. Cooper.

15:18.265 --> 15:20.223
Those clothes-- you...

15:20.267 --> 15:23.792
You look like a Gap mannequin
who wished to be a real boy.

15:23.835 --> 15:25.707
What?

15:25.750 --> 15:28.666
Mm, if I'm gonna take a break
from my rock star life,

15:28.710 --> 15:31.147
I need to take a break
from my rock star clothes,

15:31.191 --> 15:34.020
so I just went into Jake's
closet and picked up a pair of,

15:34.063 --> 15:36.326
uh... Dockers.

15:36.370 --> 15:39.547
More like Dorkers.
[laughs]

15:39.590 --> 15:41.636
Oh, wait. I bought
those for Jake.

15:41.679 --> 15:44.987
Well, look, we clearly can't
talk any sense into you,

15:45.031 --> 15:47.772
so I found someone
who hopefully can.

15:47.816 --> 15:49.687
Oh, my gosh. Mum.

15:49.731 --> 15:52.690
Good day, son.
How's my wee bub?

15:52.734 --> 15:54.214
What are you doing up
at sparrow's fart?

15:54.257 --> 15:55.563
Have you even had
your brekkie yet?

15:55.606 --> 15:57.173
Well, had me Weet-Bix,

15:57.217 --> 15:58.827
and now I'm just giving the
blue-tongues a bit of a nibble

15:58.870 --> 16:00.394
before the arvo sets in.

16:00.437 --> 16:02.091
[laughs]
Good on ya.

16:02.135 --> 16:03.832
You know, a lorikeet died
in the feeder,

16:03.875 --> 16:05.660
and a kookaburra's been gnawing
on the deck,

16:05.703 --> 16:07.792
and me gutters are stuffed
with gumnuts!

16:07.836 --> 16:10.143
No way!
Claire, can you believe that?

16:10.186 --> 16:11.927
I can't.

16:11.971 --> 16:15.235
Or can. I'm so lost.

16:15.278 --> 16:17.454
Now, Cooper,
what's this Claire tells me

16:17.498 --> 16:19.195
about you cancelling
your book tour?

16:19.239 --> 16:21.328
Yeah, I just need some time
to reassess

16:21.371 --> 16:22.807
what I'm doing with my life.

16:22.851 --> 16:24.722
I've realized
I'm surrounded by yes-men

16:24.766 --> 16:26.724
who only tell me how great I am.

16:26.768 --> 16:27.812
[laughing]:
Oh, son.

16:27.856 --> 16:30.119
Who cares
what the bludgers say?

16:30.163 --> 16:32.904
All that matters is
how you feel.

16:32.948 --> 16:35.907
Well, that's the thing.
I can't really tell anymore.

16:35.951 --> 16:40.260
Cooper, do you remember
your first big concert?

16:40.303 --> 16:43.741
You were so nervous, you nearly
chundered your Maccas.

16:43.785 --> 16:47.354
And I looked out into the crowd
and saw you in the first row

16:47.397 --> 16:49.878
holding up a sign
telling me how awesome I was.

16:49.921 --> 16:51.836
I knew you just needed
a little encouragement

16:51.880 --> 16:56.537
from someone you love to give
you the confidence to succeed.

16:56.580 --> 16:58.713
And if I could hold up a sign
right now,

16:58.756 --> 17:01.455
it'd say get your ass
back on the book tour!

17:01.498 --> 17:05.415
Maybe it was a bit dramatic
to cancel the whole thing.

17:05.459 --> 17:07.635
Thanks, Mum. Love you.

17:08.853 --> 17:11.769
And, uh,

17:11.813 --> 17:13.423
thanks to you Claire.

17:13.467 --> 17:15.077
You know, sometimes
this bizzo makes me sweat

17:15.121 --> 17:16.426
like a gypsy with a mortgage,

17:16.470 --> 17:18.776
but after having a chin wag
with my mum-mum,

17:18.820 --> 17:20.126
grinning like a shot fox again.

17:23.390 --> 17:25.653
What?

17:25.696 --> 17:26.871
Now I'm off to the studio.

17:26.915 --> 17:28.830
Oh. To write some songs?

17:28.873 --> 17:30.832
No. To ask my team what
they think of these Dockers.

17:30.875 --> 17:33.748
Anyone who says I look great
is getting bloody fired.

17:37.839 --> 17:40.407
But, uh...
[clears throat]

17:40.450 --> 17:43.497
[clears throat]
But as we like to say
in the accounting game,

17:43.540 --> 17:47.805
"It's accrualworld,
so be audityou can be."

17:47.849 --> 17:50.069
Pause for laughter.

17:51.853 --> 17:52.767
[clears throat]

17:52.810 --> 17:54.986
God, I'm thirsty.

17:56.727 --> 17:58.033
[coughs]

17:59.861 --> 18:01.645
I am?

18:02.646 --> 18:04.561
Uh, confident

18:04.605 --> 18:07.129
that our firm can be
a one-stop shop

18:07.173 --> 18:09.131
for all your client's
accounting needs.

18:09.175 --> 18:11.829
Yeah. Yeah, no one canstop me,

18:11.873 --> 18:15.355
or my firm

18:15.398 --> 18:17.922
from saving your clients
tons of money

18:17.966 --> 18:19.968
by leveraging the new tax laws

18:20.011 --> 18:23.885
to minimize their tax exposure
and maximize their bottom line.

18:23.928 --> 18:25.365
Hmm?

18:27.976 --> 18:29.151
[high-pitched]: Is it
a little tight in here, guys?

18:29.195 --> 18:30.805
Does it feel
a little tight? Hmm?

18:30.848 --> 18:31.936
Maybe loosen up.
Maybe get a little loose.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.329
You know what I'm saying, girl?

18:33.373 --> 18:35.331
Boop.Oh.

18:35.375 --> 18:38.291
Are you feeling me, KPG?

18:38.334 --> 18:39.814
ALL:
Yes.

18:39.857 --> 18:41.772
I can't hear you.

18:41.816 --> 18:44.514
Are you feeling me, KPG?

18:44.558 --> 18:46.125
ALL:
Yes!

18:46.168 --> 18:49.911
Now, I could sit here and throw
numbers at you all day, right?

18:49.954 --> 18:52.653
Or I can tell you
right here, right now

18:52.696 --> 18:55.221
that together,
we can make KPG stand

18:55.264 --> 18:58.180
for "Kapow! Profitability Guys."

18:58.224 --> 18:59.790
Come on, say it with me!

18:59.834 --> 19:02.010
ALL:
Kapow, Profitability Guys.

19:02.053 --> 19:04.186
Mm-mm. Mm-mm-mm.

19:04.230 --> 19:08.016
I need some stank on that.
Say it louder!

19:08.059 --> 19:10.801
ALL:
Kapow, Profitability Guys!

19:10.845 --> 19:12.977
[high-pitched]:
Yes! Yes!

19:13.021 --> 19:15.241
Yes! That's what
I'm talking about.

19:15.284 --> 19:17.025
That's the stuff!
That's the ticket!

19:17.068 --> 19:18.287
I'm going home!

19:18.331 --> 19:20.333
Good night, Los Angeles!

19:20.376 --> 19:24.032
[applause]

19:26.904 --> 19:28.602
Did he just leave?

19:29.951 --> 19:32.301
Who wants to hear
some actual numbers?!

19:32.345 --> 19:34.999
[applause and cheering]

19:40.353 --> 19:43.269
Congratulations on
landing the account.

19:43.312 --> 19:45.096
I never had any doubt.

19:45.140 --> 19:47.664
Nah. Right. [laughs]

19:47.708 --> 19:48.752
[tablet ringing]

19:48.796 --> 19:50.232
Oh.

19:50.276 --> 19:51.886
Hey, Cooper,
your mom's on FaceTime.

19:51.929 --> 19:53.583
Oh, I don't think he's home.

19:53.627 --> 19:54.802
Ooh, you should answer, though,

19:54.845 --> 19:56.847
so you can see
how she talks all weird.

19:56.891 --> 19:58.849
Claire, don't be
a colonialist.

19:58.893 --> 20:00.286
Hey, Cooper's mom.

20:00.329 --> 20:02.505
Oh, good day there, Jake.
Is Cooper in?

20:02.549 --> 20:04.855
Uh, no, he's not,
but we can take a message.Right.

20:04.899 --> 20:06.683
You see, Cooper's dad
was coming home

20:06.727 --> 20:09.033
after some hard yukka
beyond the black stump,

20:09.077 --> 20:11.645
and an ambo went by,
driving like the clappers

20:11.688 --> 20:13.690
'cause they had
some shark biscuit in the back.

20:13.734 --> 20:15.431
Oh, wow. That's...

20:15.475 --> 20:17.303
hilarious?

20:17.346 --> 20:19.174
You've got a sick sense
of humor, Claire.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.307
The guy lost his leg.

20:21.350 --> 20:23.352
Anyway, it was dark
as a dog's guts out,

20:23.396 --> 20:25.963
and the ambo didn't see him,
so they had a bit of a bingle.

20:26.007 --> 20:29.576
Now the ambo's trying
to blame it all on Cooper's dad,

20:29.619 --> 20:32.056
so, of course,
he's mad as a cut snake.

20:32.100 --> 20:35.756
Well, we'll be sure to
give Cooper the message.

20:35.799 --> 20:36.539
Hooroo.

20:36.583 --> 20:38.889
Hooroo.

20:38.933 --> 20:40.543
All right.

20:40.587 --> 20:41.892
Oh, hey, Coop.
Your mom just called.

20:41.936 --> 20:43.285
Oh. What'd she say?

20:43.329 --> 20:44.504
[laughing]:
We have no idea.

20:44.547 --> 20:46.201
Your dad was driving home
from work,

20:46.245 --> 20:47.637
and he got into a fender bender
with an ambulance.

20:47.681 --> 20:49.204
Everything's fine, but
the ambulance driver's trying

20:49.248 --> 20:50.684
to act like it was his fault.

20:50.727 --> 20:52.294
Ah, he'll be mad
as a cut snake then.

20:52.338 --> 20:53.948
[laughs]
Hooroo.

20:53.991 --> 20:56.342
Hooroo.

20:56.385 --> 20:57.604
How did you...?

20:57.647 --> 20:59.736
Literally
just guessed.
[laughs]
