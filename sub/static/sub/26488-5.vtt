WEBVTT

00:29.638 --> 00:32.075
And just a little wifely advice,

00:41.171 --> 00:45.262
the "king is enthroned in
a position of divine worship."

00:45.306 --> 00:49.788
So even as an advisor to the
president of the United States,

00:51.355 --> 00:53.662
Oh, and you can't
wear white or black.

00:53.705 --> 00:54.924
Wh-What?

00:54.967 --> 00:56.317
Uh, which shirt
to meet the king?

00:56.360 --> 00:59.711
I don't know. Blake's still
working on the invite.

00:59.755 --> 01:02.192
So his birthday reception's
a pretty hot ticket, huh?

01:09.765 --> 01:12.376
No, she's just an
invited speaker.

01:18.426 --> 01:20.036
So how's, um,

01:20.080 --> 01:22.038
her husband,
what's his name?

01:27.783 --> 01:29.089
What?

02:06.213 --> 02:09.738
There's only one woman
who ever challenged me

02:09.781 --> 02:12.219
with laser-like precision.

02:26.624 --> 02:27.973
And when are we thinking
that's gonna be?

02:28.017 --> 02:29.540
Not for a while.

02:29.584 --> 02:31.194
But we should tell
the kids soon, right?

02:35.372 --> 02:37.853
Jason's college counselor.

02:37.896 --> 02:39.985
I just don't want them
to hear it from someone else.

02:46.427 --> 02:47.515
Yeah, it's just...

02:47.558 --> 02:49.604
telling the kids
makes it so freaking...

03:05.315 --> 03:07.491
about writing a personal
statement on sea turtles...

03:07.535 --> 03:09.014
Again, it was a metaphor

03:10.668 --> 03:12.366
in a time of rising fascism.

03:16.457 --> 03:19.111
along with that perfect
SAT score did the job.

03:19.155 --> 03:20.287
Vassar,

03:20.330 --> 03:23.072
Northwestern and Vonderhauf

03:23.115 --> 03:24.682
all offered scholarship
packages.

03:24.726 --> 03:27.076
That's what I'm
talking about.Oh, wow, hey, man.

03:35.563 --> 03:38.392
successive years contingent
on academic performance.

03:38.435 --> 03:41.308
Northwestern and Vassar,
closer to 30%.

03:43.962 --> 03:45.616
We should have
gone down there.They're all excellent schools.

03:47.096 --> 03:50.752
Look into campus life,
faculty, class sizes.

03:52.275 --> 03:53.711
Yeah. Uh, Vassar
used to be all girls, right?

03:53.755 --> 03:56.323
Originally, yes.Great, I'll go there.

03:56.366 --> 03:58.542
Well, now, there's no need
to just...We'll do a little more research.

03:58.586 --> 04:00.457
Well, no, Dad, it's a male
to female ratio.

04:00.501 --> 04:02.764
There's less competition
on the field.

04:02.807 --> 04:04.505
Well,
that's solid criteria.

04:06.115 --> 04:08.552
so you'll want to indicate
your choice

04:16.473 --> 04:17.692
Okay, I got to go.

04:20.825 --> 04:23.306
Thank you so much.I'm-I'm happy to fulfill
everyone's status expectations.

04:24.394 --> 04:25.874
It just looks like cynicism.

04:25.917 --> 04:27.571
Congratulations.Thanks.
Thank you.

04:33.447 --> 04:34.970
The Human Rights
Heroes Luncheon

04:35.013 --> 04:37.581
is asking that you move up
your arrival by half an hour,

04:39.496 --> 04:40.889
to the newly confirmed
ambassadors.

04:44.458 --> 04:45.720
I'll push back.

04:45.763 --> 04:47.983
I did manage to secure
an invitation for Henry

04:48.026 --> 04:49.985
to the king of Thailand's
birthday reception.

04:51.247 --> 04:52.422
Oh, it's no problem.

04:52.466 --> 04:54.337
I didn't really want
my firstborn, anyway.

04:54.381 --> 04:56.426
There wasn't a plus-one
with that, was there?

04:56.470 --> 04:57.688
I can reapproach.

04:57.732 --> 04:58.994
No, no. It's fine. It's...

04:59.037 --> 05:00.517
Ma'am, uh, good morning.

05:05.609 --> 05:07.655
No, no. It's fine. I'll do
a quick polish beforehand.

05:14.052 --> 05:16.664
I thought we weren't shouting
that from the rooftops just yet.

05:16.707 --> 05:21.321
Not shouting. Just the dim
roar of a gathering wave

05:21.364 --> 05:22.583
far out on the horizon.

05:28.545 --> 05:30.547
A grassroots super PAC
calling themselves

05:30.591 --> 05:32.201
"Run, Bess, Run" is already
gathering donations

05:32.244 --> 05:33.594
for your campaign.

05:33.637 --> 05:34.943
Huh.

05:34.986 --> 05:36.248
Try to contain your joy.

05:44.082 --> 05:46.215
Then why are you
telling me this?

05:46.258 --> 05:47.477
Because it's thrilling.

05:47.521 --> 05:49.566
And it also leads me
to my next topic:

05:51.438 --> 05:53.396
Mm, of course you are.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.267
Got to tell your story,
start burnishing the myth,

05:55.311 --> 05:56.617
but keep it relatable.

06:01.317 --> 06:02.710
I mean, it's 'cause my
ex-wife doesn't want me to,

06:02.753 --> 06:04.102
and I could probably
push past that,

06:04.146 --> 06:05.974
but somehow I don't.

06:11.545 --> 06:14.635
The book that I do not
have time to write.

06:16.463 --> 06:18.552
Lorraine Sheridan,
speechwriter for the annoyingly

06:23.905 --> 06:26.429
Think of it as an
investment in your future.

06:36.961 --> 06:39.921
I'll have Blake get me
a cup of coffee.

06:39.964 --> 06:43.098
Go fix the world.

06:43.141 --> 06:45.143
â™ª

06:54.544 --> 06:56.285
Oh. Wow.

06:56.328 --> 06:57.852
Oh, my gosh, you look
just the same.

07:06.513 --> 07:08.471
[both speaking Thai]

07:11.909 --> 07:13.215
Thank you.

07:29.492 --> 07:31.929
I've lived away from here too
long. They know I'm a tourist.

07:35.890 --> 07:39.284
Uh, just water for me, thanks.

07:41.678 --> 07:42.984
You, too, Roe.

07:43.027 --> 07:47.510
It's been, what, like, 25 years?

07:59.870 --> 08:01.611
I just reorganized a
couple of your thoughts.

08:01.655 --> 08:02.960
No.

08:05.920 --> 08:10.533
[chuckles]But still not good
at taking compliments, I see.

08:10.577 --> 08:12.535
Thank you.

08:20.021 --> 08:21.805
Lawan.
Lawan.

08:21.849 --> 08:23.764
They're both living
in the U.S. now.

08:29.813 --> 08:32.250
And Lawan is just starting
her master's in Comp Lit.

08:32.294 --> 08:34.644
Clearly, she's your girl.

09:10.724 --> 09:13.857
You know?

09:13.901 --> 09:16.860
It's like, suddenly, I can get
back to everything I was before.

09:30.918 --> 09:33.573
this book will have
minimal impact on your life.

09:33.616 --> 09:37.141
Well, I have to admit,
that's a relief to hear.

09:52.766 --> 09:56.639
Good. 'Cause Mike B.
didn't say anything,

09:56.683 --> 10:01.470
but if this book means
what I think it does,

10:01.513 --> 10:03.515
I am so freakin' on board.

10:03.559 --> 10:04.691
[laughs]

10:06.780 --> 10:08.651
I do. I, um...

10:30.804 --> 10:32.762
The earlier in your
life, the better.

10:34.590 --> 10:36.026
Whatever comes to you.

10:40.814 --> 10:41.728
Does that sound good?

10:41.771 --> 10:44.905
Okay. Yeah.

10:50.475 --> 10:53.000
You confronted the guy. He was,
like, a six-four linebacker.

10:53.043 --> 10:54.654
You called him an asshat,
and I had to...

10:54.697 --> 10:57.787
He kept interrupting class
with nothing to say.

10:57.831 --> 10:59.920
I didn't expect for you
to challenge him to a duel!

10:59.963 --> 11:02.313
Well, I was his T.A. I had...
I had to do something.

11:02.357 --> 11:03.837
Humor was the best way
to defuse the situation.

11:07.928 --> 11:09.756
I still got academic censure.

11:09.799 --> 11:12.976
He didn't even
read the essay.

11:15.631 --> 11:18.025
who goes off without
anything to say?
Yes.

11:21.071 --> 11:22.943
I suppose we
should be thankful

11:22.986 --> 11:24.640
there was no
Internet back then.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.990
[laughing]:
Yes.

11:27.034 --> 11:29.993
So tomorrow,
you know what time and where?

11:30.037 --> 11:32.474
Yeah, I'm all set.

11:57.368 --> 11:59.283
Yeah.

12:10.207 --> 12:12.906
Second interview?I can't disclose that.

12:18.215 --> 12:20.609
who summons the speaker's
inner voice.

12:29.052 --> 12:31.663
Look, I know those remarks
I wrote for the luncheon

12:31.707 --> 12:34.014
weren't my best, but then,
she barely had any notes.

12:49.856 --> 12:51.814
[both breathe deeply]

12:58.212 --> 13:01.737
It was meant to be ironic,
but trust me, you're fine.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.044
[whispering]:
What was the meeting about?

13:04.087 --> 13:06.046
That I can't tell you.

13:11.094 --> 13:13.923
[horns honking]

13:13.967 --> 13:16.273
Why would anyone willingly
submit themselves

13:24.281 --> 13:27.110
until I was eight years old,
and I've always found

13:27.154 --> 13:29.721
the best way to find out
what people are really thinking

13:29.765 --> 13:31.898
is to eavesdrop on the bus.

13:36.946 --> 13:40.036
"I don't work, but I go
to temple four times a day,

13:40.080 --> 13:41.995
"and with what they pay me,

13:54.137 --> 13:58.098
A Buddhist nation that worships
its own king as semi-divine.

13:58.141 --> 14:00.100
[audience murmuring]We have gathered here

14:00.143 --> 14:01.971
to examine freedom of faith
all over the world,

14:27.083 --> 14:29.259
But I tell you...

14:35.962 --> 14:39.095
to this family's rule
over Thailand.[door opens]

14:39.139 --> 14:43.665
Let the monarchy die when our
king passes from this world.

14:43.708 --> 14:45.885
And let the people
of Thailand choose

15:19.570 --> 15:22.356
60 years in prison?HENRY: I should have known

15:22.399 --> 15:23.531
she was planning something.

15:44.769 --> 15:47.990
that she's treated well,
has adequate representation.

15:48.034 --> 15:49.731
Beyond that...

15:49.774 --> 15:50.993
I'm sorry, babe. I-I don't mean

15:52.299 --> 15:53.691
I want to help,

15:58.044 --> 16:00.872
so far, but you...

16:11.318 --> 16:14.408
Are you sure? I don't want
to cause you any trouble.

16:16.410 --> 16:18.325
Officially, you are representing

16:18.368 --> 16:20.980
the president
of the United States.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.287
to get your moment,
use it wisely.

16:39.389 --> 16:41.565
You just got accepted
into three schools.

16:41.609 --> 16:43.263
Shouldn't you be coasting?

16:43.306 --> 16:46.092
No. It's this stupid scholarship
application for Vonderhauf.

16:48.790 --> 16:50.792
Like, can't they just
data-mine my social media

16:50.835 --> 16:52.794
like everyone else?That must be so hard--

16:55.927 --> 16:58.321
Okay, it's not like I get
the money, you know? Uh...

16:58.365 --> 17:00.715
Guys, you ready for
this? Check this out.

17:10.116 --> 17:12.466
the United States has restored
its role as a leader

17:12.509 --> 17:14.076
to nations all over the world,

17:14.120 --> 17:17.471
bringing peace, stability
and a spirit of cooperation

17:17.514 --> 17:19.212
that lifts a torch
to light the way.

17:20.430 --> 17:21.997
Elizabeth McCord.
She's for all of us.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.304
STEVIE [laughs]:
Oh, my God.ALISON: You guys,

17:33.704 --> 17:35.706
Oh, yeah.

17:38.448 --> 17:41.799
Um, I just got to finish
some college stuff.

17:43.758 --> 17:45.107
JASON:
Please don't.

17:59.469 --> 18:03.386
It is a great honor
to meet Your Majesty.

18:05.562 --> 18:06.737
with many celebrations to come.

18:08.217 --> 18:10.915
If I could also ask
Your Majesty a favor,

18:24.973 --> 18:28.542
She spoke only of her hopes
for the future of Thailand.

18:28.585 --> 18:33.416
This is not a topic
for His Majesty's celebration.

18:40.945 --> 18:46.081
I ask that he release himself
from the burden of resentment,

19:02.315 --> 19:04.404
[speaking Thai]

19:45.053 --> 19:47.751
Well, I have something
sort of sensitive to discuss.

19:47.795 --> 19:49.188
[laughing]:
Oh, no.

19:49.231 --> 19:50.493
Did my wife call you?

20:00.329 --> 20:02.940
Mike B. has me
writing a memoir.

20:02.984 --> 20:04.551
Why?
And...

20:09.817 --> 20:11.601
You don't need a ghostwriter.

20:11.645 --> 20:13.037
Thanks, but I'm
a little busy.

20:17.390 --> 20:20.131
Sorry. I'm sorry. Go on.Okay, so,

20:20.175 --> 20:22.438
he assigned me
this ghostwriter.
Uh-huh.

20:36.496 --> 20:38.585
on a strike to get better
practice conditions.

20:38.628 --> 20:40.239
That's an interesting way
to remember it.

20:40.282 --> 20:41.544
Think she wants
something younger. What?

20:41.588 --> 20:43.329
What do you mean?
Really?

20:43.372 --> 20:45.635
Well, as you explained it
to me at the time,

20:51.728 --> 20:53.295
because the boys
weren't sharing.so that you could

20:59.780 --> 21:02.348
[laughing]:
I don't remember
it that way, no.

21:06.134 --> 21:09.877
So, you seriously cannot think
of a single instance

21:09.920 --> 21:11.748
where you stepped up

21:11.792 --> 21:15.186
and took on a more difficult
leadership role?

21:21.628 --> 21:24.065
to a bereft little brother?

21:24.108 --> 21:26.110
That's different.
I don't...

21:26.154 --> 21:28.765
I... That was... I...

21:28.809 --> 21:30.811
It was pretty fierce.

21:41.778 --> 21:43.911
I have decided... I am
running for president.

21:43.954 --> 21:45.129
Yes! I knew it

21:45.173 --> 21:46.827
as soon as you
said "Mike B."

21:46.870 --> 21:49.786
Oh, that was
your first clue?
Listen to me.

22:31.437 --> 22:32.916
I managed to get
an audience with the king.

22:44.754 --> 22:47.017
risked my life for nothing?

22:50.760 --> 22:52.371
And now I'm running
back to the West,

23:03.338 --> 23:06.863
Why would you want to
spend 60 years in prison,

23:48.862 --> 23:51.865
I just wanted to do
something with my life.

24:15.584 --> 24:21.068
I guess I thought maybe
I could catch fire again.

24:27.466 --> 24:30.207
Is that why you
broke up with me?

24:41.480 --> 24:43.960
never letting me
off the mat...

24:44.004 --> 24:48.443
that girl was a little scary,
but she was also brave.

24:52.099 --> 24:54.318
not rot away in some prison.

25:05.939 --> 25:07.854
I got a call from Colleen.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.214
You need to take it out.No, no, there's
too many kernels.

25:20.257 --> 25:21.520
It's all--
It's gonna burn.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.544
I'm not ready
to go to college.

26:04.127 --> 26:06.086
take a step back, you know,
get my head together.

26:20.100 --> 26:22.668
They don't eat
a lot of popcorn

26:28.064 --> 26:29.500
Who's the girl?

26:33.766 --> 26:35.681
You think you got
a perfect SAT,

26:41.991 --> 26:46.082
Look...
Look...

26:52.175 --> 26:53.133
There it was,
all over the Internet.

26:59.966 --> 27:01.968
Did you sign a release
or something?
No, no, I...

27:02.011 --> 27:04.579
That's not right.
I will fix that.

28:03.769 --> 28:06.510
Huh.
Thinking you could
do a pass.

28:06.554 --> 28:08.904
Maybe fill in some details,
inner thoughts,

28:22.831 --> 28:27.967
Um... Lorraine...

28:28.010 --> 28:31.144
so, you-you've done books
for a lot of candidates.

28:31.187 --> 28:32.885
A few.

28:34.103 --> 28:36.279
People don't vote for policy.

28:36.323 --> 28:38.107
They vote for people.

28:40.109 --> 28:43.069
You don't need to know
about your lawyer's childhood

28:49.902 --> 28:53.383
The more you can share of your
personal life, your family,

28:53.427 --> 28:55.385
the more people connect.

29:02.262 --> 29:05.308
[cell phone ringing]

29:08.311 --> 29:09.965
How could you let that Super PAC

29:15.841 --> 29:18.582
I'm clear on that, now let me
make it equally clear

29:21.368 --> 29:23.239
without running it by me first.

29:23.283 --> 29:25.198
That's gonna be difficult.

29:25.241 --> 29:26.852
If "difficult" means doable
but inconvenient,

29:29.768 --> 29:31.160
Not exactly breaking news.

29:41.431 --> 29:42.955
That makes sense.

29:44.086 --> 29:46.306
you sent me a writer
who'd flatter me

29:47.960 --> 29:51.485
I told you I found the best
person to write your book. You.

30:01.887 --> 30:04.150
I'm hanging up now.

30:04.193 --> 30:05.542
ROCHANA:
Everything's fine.

30:05.586 --> 30:07.283
We're on our way
to the airport.

30:09.677 --> 30:11.026
ROCHANA:
I have to go, Lawan.

30:14.987 --> 30:16.771
but she's extremely
relieved.

30:19.513 --> 30:20.644
What are these guys doing?

30:54.896 --> 30:56.376
What? Wait.They're taking me in.

31:03.383 --> 31:04.775
I'm an official
of the United States government.

31:21.270 --> 31:24.143
Sorry, I, uh,
forgot about the PTSD.

31:35.415 --> 31:37.417
to get those scholarship offers?

31:37.460 --> 31:39.593
Yes, and presumably
I will still be the same

31:39.636 --> 31:42.204
desirable prospect
however many years from now

32:31.732 --> 32:33.560
the one person who'd
support me on this.
[scoffs]

32:51.404 --> 32:53.406
[phone chimes]

33:05.984 --> 33:07.898
Yeah. Where's Dad?

33:21.521 --> 33:24.263
by the fiery remarks
of Professor Rochana Arak

33:24.306 --> 33:27.570
at a religious freedom
conference in Bangkok

33:43.021 --> 33:45.588
He-he was helping
a-a friend.

33:54.684 --> 33:56.556
ELIZABETH: I spoke with
Ambassador Faraday,

33:56.599 --> 33:58.036
but with all the chaos,

33:58.079 --> 33:59.646
we're having trouble
getting any answers.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.713
and I'm willing to work it
to any advantage,

34:23.757 --> 34:27.065
make a personal appeal
to the minister of defense.

34:29.502 --> 34:31.243
Sir, I would advise
an extraction.

34:31.286 --> 34:33.767
Low-key,
untraceable black ops.

34:33.810 --> 34:37.597
We have the necessary
assets in place.

34:46.867 --> 34:49.435
It seems to me that diplomatic
pressure should at least

34:52.046 --> 34:54.353
how long it will take
for a new regime

34:56.920 --> 34:59.488
Or if they'd even
be open to them.

35:56.415 --> 35:57.633
Whoa. Hey.

35:57.677 --> 35:58.808
What's going on?

36:05.859 --> 36:07.339
and Professor Arak, too.

36:56.910 --> 36:58.912
Mom.

37:06.049 --> 37:07.964
I'm so sorry, babe.[chuckles]

37:08.008 --> 37:09.792
[whispers]:
I love you.

37:09.836 --> 37:11.098
[whispers]:
I love you, too.

37:16.234 --> 37:19.106
Welcome home.

37:51.530 --> 37:53.009
Welcome back, ma'am.
Hi.

37:55.229 --> 37:56.883
of the country and
they're, how to put it,

38:10.113 --> 38:11.811
the husband of
the Secretary of State?

38:11.854 --> 38:12.942
Didn't come up, no.
Huh.

38:14.727 --> 38:16.903
to execute an
American citizen.

38:16.946 --> 38:21.690
Okay, call, um, NSA Hill
and have her set up a meeting

38:32.788 --> 38:34.834
Um, first of all, welcome back.

38:34.877 --> 38:36.879
I'm really glad Henry's okay.

38:36.923 --> 38:38.533
Thank you.

38:40.405 --> 38:45.366
Uh... okay, uh...
yeah. Look, uh,

38:45.410 --> 38:48.369
I-I know you haven't been happy
with my work lately

38:48.413 --> 38:51.764
and I know you've been looking
at Lorraine Sheridan.

39:07.432 --> 39:09.390
but that's over.

39:09.434 --> 39:11.610
Lorraine does
ghostwriting?
Yeah.

39:11.653 --> 39:15.004
How do you, uh, get on
the list for that gig?

39:19.313 --> 39:21.620
by taking each topic
that comes your way

39:21.663 --> 39:23.056
and finding
the beating heart in it,

39:25.537 --> 39:28.844
welcome address
at a trade conference

39:50.431 --> 39:52.302
Okay.

39:52.346 --> 39:53.913
I'm sorry. It's just been
a rough couple days.

40:13.062 --> 40:15.064
Yeah.
Okay.

40:15.848 --> 40:17.806
Yeah, deal.

40:25.901 --> 40:28.469
[sighs]
Although she did seem
pretty definitive.

40:31.907 --> 40:33.169
You know, the whole
White House thing.

40:48.315 --> 40:51.144
and defended her beliefs

41:21.522 --> 41:23.655
next year.

41:25.613 --> 41:27.093
I'll fill you in later.No, look, I'm-I'm gonna
call Colleen tomorrow

41:42.064 --> 41:43.544
Oh, you're really doing a number
on yourself there, dude.

41:44.719 --> 41:46.155
Look, for a self-declared
anarchist,

41:46.199 --> 41:47.592
turns out
I'm surprisingly concerned

42:05.131 --> 42:07.612
that there's nothing
more important to me

42:07.655 --> 42:11.529
than this family and making sure
that everybody feels safe

42:11.572 --> 42:15.794
and respected.
And that's going to be

42:20.146 --> 42:22.148
for president.

42:22.191 --> 42:25.891
[chuckles] Are we allowed to say
that we sort of already knew?

42:34.160 --> 42:35.857
[whoops] Mom![cheering]

42:42.168 --> 42:44.300
ELIZABETH:
Oh, honey.
