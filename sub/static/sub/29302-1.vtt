WEBVTT

00:38.672 --> 00:43.308
And finally Emmett Charles
is our regional debate champion

00:43.310 --> 00:47.379
and will go on to compete
in the state championship.

00:51.786 --> 00:53.552
Let's go Emmett!

00:55.489 --> 00:56.789
Let's go Emmett!

00:56.791 --> 00:57.790
Woo!

00:59.427 --> 01:03.629
- Let's go, Emmett!
- Woo!

01:03.631 --> 01:06.231
- Way to go, Emmett.
- Thanks Ms. Ally.

01:07.301 --> 01:09.234
- Way to go!
- Thanks, Mr. Hume.

01:22.183 --> 01:24.116
Let's go, Emmett!

01:27.088 --> 01:27.753
And in case you missed--

01:27.755 --> 01:29.422
Way to go, Emmett.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.090
Don't forget to
congratulate Emmett Charles.

01:31.092 --> 01:32.357
- Way to go, little bro.
- Thanks, Luke!

01:32.359 --> 01:34.326
Oh, I have tutorials,
don't be late.

01:34.328 --> 01:36.161
- Mom will be very mad, okay?
- I got you.

01:36.163 --> 01:37.830
Why does any trophy
need to be that big?

01:37.832 --> 01:39.598
It's a disgusting
display of triumph.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.433
- Triumph!
- Guys.

01:41.434 --> 01:43.267
- Freedom! - Guys.
- Stella!

01:43.270 --> 01:45.571
- Guys.
- Ya know, Mac had a few good points in that last round,

01:45.573 --> 01:47.206
- but his fuel argument was weak.
- Guys.

01:47.207 --> 01:48.840
Well it's all for the nothing
if you don't have freedom.

01:48.843 --> 01:50.542
- Guys.
- Braveheart.

01:50.544 --> 01:52.845
It really does apply to
nothing and to everything.

01:52.847 --> 01:56.115
Man, I'm just feeling so much
love in here this morning.

01:56.117 --> 01:57.683
- Guys.
- You should really carry that thing

01:57.685 --> 01:59.151
around with you every day.

01:59.153 --> 02:00.519
So, did you guys
finish all the movies?

02:00.521 --> 02:02.654
I didn't. I got <i>Ferris</i>
<i>Bueller's, Clueless,</i>

02:02.656 --> 02:04.356
<i>The Virgin Suicides,</i>
and <i>Breakfast Club</i> left.

02:04.358 --> 02:06.692
We can't discuss the archetype
for high school movies

02:06.694 --> 02:08.160
if you don't see the originals.

02:08.162 --> 02:10.529
John Hughes, Mario Van Peebles,

02:10.531 --> 02:12.865
Penelope Spheeris, Sally
Potter, George Lucas.

02:12.867 --> 02:14.867
I mean, look at
<i>Splendor in the Grass.</i>

02:14.869 --> 02:16.401
Could there be any
better narrative

02:16.403 --> 02:18.871
about teenage heartbreak,
loss, stagnancy,

02:18.873 --> 02:20.639
and the fragility
of the human mind?

02:21.308 --> 02:22.741
That's gotta be a
rhetorical question.

02:23.244 --> 02:25.777
Guys,
after homework today,

02:25.779 --> 02:27.412
you gotta get goin' on
some of these movies

02:27.414 --> 02:29.615
- or we're never ev--
- Yeah!

02:44.932 --> 02:47.799
I gotta go anyway.
I gotta finish my calculus, world history,

02:47.801 --> 02:49.635
and social studies homework
before the first bell.

02:50.671 --> 02:51.904
Oh, crap sticks.

02:52.706 --> 02:53.805
Wait up!

02:54.341 --> 02:57.609
Hey, congrat--

02:57.611 --> 02:59.378
- Bless you.
- Thanks.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.346
You get nervous around
me, don't you, T?

03:01.348 --> 03:03.515
No. Why would you think that?

03:03.517 --> 03:05.584
'Cause when you get
nervous, you sneeze.

03:05.586 --> 03:07.019
Right, I'm nervous that the cops

03:07.020 --> 03:08.453
are gonna show up and
I'm gonna be in trouble

03:08.455 --> 03:12.291
for talking to
a 12 year-old.

03:12.293 --> 03:14.693
Talking's not a crime.
Bless you.

03:14.795 --> 03:19.398
Hm, I like how you're
accessorizing today. Subtle.

03:19.400 --> 03:22.467
You got a real Kanye meets
the Stanley Cup vibe going.

03:22.469 --> 03:25.537
Oh, really great pop culture
references there, Joy.

03:25.539 --> 03:28.307
- Really.
- Oh, get your Halloween hand off of me.

03:28.309 --> 03:30.876
All right, well,
we've gotta go to class.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.978
So, bye Emmett. Let's go, Joy.

03:32.980 --> 03:36.281
Well this has been a
lot of fun, Mr. Little.

03:36.283 --> 03:38.450
- See you later, Stuart.
- Stuart Little.

03:38.452 --> 03:40.886
Oh the mouse, the
E.B. White classic.

03:40.888 --> 03:43.689
Yep, I got it. I'm
small, may seem a bit mousey.

03:43.691 --> 03:45.791
Again, Joy, great reference.

03:45.793 --> 03:48.694
- Mm, another great comeback.
- Okay.

03:48.696 --> 03:49.861
Hey Cole, be there.

03:49.863 --> 03:52.231
Bye.

03:53.934 --> 03:56.401
Tonya, Tonya, Tonya, Tonya.

03:56.403 --> 03:57.703
So funny and smart.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.238
Let's go to the movies.

03:59.240 --> 04:00.806
Let's go get coffee.

04:00.808 --> 04:04.509
Let's go watch an old black
and white movie together

04:04.511 --> 04:07.379
on a lazy Sunday with
some deep dish pizza.

04:21.894 --> 04:23.762
Oh, oh hey, Mac.

04:23.764 --> 04:26.965
I know you had your heart set
on winning and going to State,

04:26.967 --> 04:29.034
but I mean, you're
a great debater

04:29.036 --> 04:30.435
and a valiant competitor.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.771
It's just, your fuel
argument just lacked--

04:32.773 --> 04:34.806
- I can't believe this.
- What?

04:34.808 --> 04:36.942
Why do you think I want
constructive criticism from you?

04:37.745 --> 04:39.344
- I was just--
- You're a child.

04:39.346 --> 04:41.513
- I'm just--
- Yeah, no, I know.

04:41.515 --> 04:43.482
Okay, we all know the prodigy
with the single mother

04:43.484 --> 04:45.450
and the screwed-up brother
who carries the hopes

04:45.452 --> 04:48.387
and dreams of his entire
race on his shoulders story.

04:48.389 --> 04:49.471
But you're 12.

04:49.472 --> 04:50.554
Okay, you don't
actually know anything

04:50.557 --> 04:52.724
about life and how hard it is.

04:52.726 --> 04:53.725
I mean, how can you even know

04:53.727 --> 04:55.594
what winning and losing means?

04:55.596 --> 04:56.895
Failure is...

04:58.699 --> 05:01.033
Oh my God,
I just cracked

05:01.035 --> 05:03.502
the perfect prodigy
puzzle, didn't I?

05:03.971 --> 05:06.738
- You've never failed.
- Yes I have.

05:06.740 --> 05:09.374
- No you haven't.
- I haven't tried not to fail.

05:09.376 --> 05:11.810
You just succeed and
succeed and succeed

05:11.812 --> 05:15.047
and I bet, if given the choice,

05:15.049 --> 05:17.616
you would choose to succeed
over almost anything.

05:18.452 --> 05:20.552
Who do you do it for,
because it's not for you.

05:22.723 --> 05:23.922
You're a child.

05:23.924 --> 05:26.925
Your prefrontal cortex isn't
developed enough to know

05:26.927 --> 05:29.061
when or why you should
give up or give in.

05:29.997 --> 05:32.631
Emotionally you're not even 12.

05:33.434 --> 05:34.700
You're like 10.

05:41.775 --> 05:43.875
- Good morning.
- Okay. Okay!

05:43.877 --> 05:44.943
- Talk to her.
- Get away.

05:46.113 --> 05:47.479
- Hey Selma.
- Hm?

05:47.481 --> 05:50.649
We think we should discuss
what's been happening

05:50.651 --> 05:53.018
around here the last few months.

05:53.854 --> 05:57.589
- I know we're all very concerned about the safety of our campus.
- Yeah.

05:57.591 --> 06:00.692
But we haven't had an
incident in a few weeks,

06:00.694 --> 06:02.060
and I think this
means the perpetrators

06:02.062 --> 06:05.864
- know we're on to them.
- Them.

06:05.866 --> 06:09.501
I'm sorry, who is them?

06:09.503 --> 06:13.105
Being a victim, I'd like
to know where my stuff is.

06:13.107 --> 06:15.807
I don't know they
know we're on to them.

06:15.809 --> 06:17.609
What it means is they're aware

06:17.611 --> 06:18.777
that we know what's happening.

06:18.779 --> 06:21.580
Oh, I'm sorry, is that a riddle?

06:21.915 --> 06:24.850
I don't understand your
verbal Sudoku, Selma.

06:24.852 --> 06:26.885
I just wanna know
where my crap is!

06:26.887 --> 06:29.154
Carol, we can calm down now.

06:29.156 --> 06:34.159
Sorry to interrupt.
I'm Detective Gregory. I was called.

06:34.161 --> 06:37.829
Oh yes, no, I called you. I thought it
was time to bring in the authorities.

06:37.831 --> 06:41.166
- Thank you. Thank you for coming.
- Really?

06:41.168 --> 06:44.770
You took it upon yourself to call
the police without even a discussion?

06:44.772 --> 06:48.607
Mr. Hume, you forget, we have a
system in place here. We have Floyd.

06:48.609 --> 06:51.109
Oh Floyd! You mean our
crack security ace who naps

06:51.111 --> 06:53.412
between the hours of 11 and 2?

06:53.414 --> 06:56.181
Floyd, the master sleuth
who can sniff out

06:56.183 --> 06:58.884
a Papa John's ten
miles from here,

06:58.886 --> 07:01.853
and who never misses
a staff birthday cake?

07:01.855 --> 07:04.456
Floyd, the powerless Dumbledore

07:04.458 --> 07:07.025
of our hallowed campus and the--

07:07.027 --> 07:09.027
You are illustrating
my point perfectly.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.762
She was literally
just insulting you

07:10.764 --> 07:12.497
for always eating food, and
then you grabbed a donut?

07:12.499 --> 07:14.433
Shouldn't you be out
patrolling somewhere?

07:14.435 --> 07:15.534
Well, I'm here to--

07:15.536 --> 07:18.703
Look, my laptop was stolen.

07:18.705 --> 07:20.205
Okay, so that's what
we're here about.

07:20.207 --> 07:22.808
And I am writing an
extremely personal

07:22.810 --> 07:26.011
autobiographical novella
that I did not back up.

07:26.013 --> 07:30.916
And I am very foggy about a lot of the
events of my past because of an accident

07:30.918 --> 07:36.888
with a hammer, a can of paint, and a
raccoon so you can imagine my desire.

07:36.890 --> 07:39.591
You know what, okay, thank you, Carol.
I think we should let the detective--

07:39.593 --> 07:44.095
Not all of us remember why we have a
five inch scar on the bottom of our foot,

07:44.097 --> 07:47.699
or why our right thumb
is straight as a board

07:47.701 --> 07:50.802
and the left one
looks like a fishhook.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.888
Okay, I'm gonna talk
to all the victims.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.973
- I just caught a salmon with my thumb.
- I'll get this figured out.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.042
She's just bending her thumbs.
I know, and this--

07:57.044 --> 07:57.976
- Start with me.
- Okay.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.711
You can do me last.

07:59.713 --> 08:01.513
I'll do you next, talk to you.

08:01.515 --> 08:03.615
- You'll do me next?
- Next.

08:03.617 --> 08:06.952
Finally a man in a blazer,
not in a vest.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.087
You know what, that's
a low blow, Carol.

08:09.089 --> 08:11.523
- That is a low blow.
- Hm!

08:11.525 --> 08:13.959
So how come you haven't you
reported these thefts yet?

08:14.528 --> 08:16.561
Well, we handle
internal conflict

08:16.563 --> 08:18.096
with Parent-Teacher Council.

08:18.098 --> 08:20.031
I didn't wanna disrupt
the entire campus

08:20.033 --> 08:22.133
over a few stolen purses.

08:23.270 --> 08:26.972
I mean, seven laptops,
12 phones, jewelry, cash,

08:26.974 --> 08:29.241
four purses, wrestling trophy,

08:29.243 --> 08:32.010
and three desktop
computers from storage.

08:32.011 --> 08:34.179
It's hardly a few purses.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.816
Did you and Mr. Hume
have a weekend getaway

08:37.818 --> 08:40.184
or a phone conversation?

08:40.186 --> 08:42.553
I think he's just concerned
about what's going on here.

08:42.556 --> 08:45.924
Well, Larry is just
full of concern.

08:48.762 --> 08:51.830
I don't understand why
you're not concerned.

08:53.534 --> 08:56.034
In my career as a
moderately successful novelist,

08:56.036 --> 08:58.103
- Excuse me.
- and perennial SAT tutor,

08:58.105 --> 09:00.672
I've learned that
diligence, a word

09:00.674 --> 09:03.675
on today's vocabulary list,
is the key to success.

09:03.677 --> 09:07.012
So, it's important to
be here for every class.

09:07.014 --> 09:08.246
In fact, every minute

09:08.248 --> 09:09.114
- is important.
- Sorry.

09:09.116 --> 09:10.582
- Oh.
- Sorry.

09:10.584 --> 09:11.950
Sorry, my bad.

09:13.620 --> 09:15.086
My bad, sorry.

09:15.088 --> 09:16.555
Pardon me.

09:16.557 --> 09:17.789
Pardon me.

09:19.293 --> 09:21.226
Pardon me, sorry.

09:21.228 --> 09:24.663
This is really more
disruptive than I anticipated.

09:25.165 --> 09:27.299
Okay.

09:27.834 --> 09:29.067
Punctuality.

09:29.069 --> 09:32.037
This is a word you should
know not only for your SATs,

09:32.039 --> 09:33.939
but also for life
in general, yes?

09:34.875 --> 09:36.959
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

09:36.960 --> 09:39.044
Okay, it worries me that only
three of you are nodding.

09:40.647 --> 09:41.680
Moving on.

09:41.682 --> 09:46.685
Who can tell me the meaning
of the word divisive?

09:48.789 --> 09:50.088
Divisive.

09:52.292 --> 09:55.026
This is the word that
describes the relationships

09:55.028 --> 09:57.796
most of you have
with your parents.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.199
- Yes.
- Uh, annoying?

10:03.136 --> 10:06.304
Tending to cause disagreement
or hostility between people.

10:06.306 --> 10:09.074
That is exactly right. Ha, see?

10:09.076 --> 10:10.909
You can thank Google.

10:10.911 --> 10:12.844
Okay, that would be
described as cheating.

10:13.347 --> 10:18.116
Please define for me importune.

10:20.687 --> 10:23.021
To ask someone pressingly
and persistently for

10:23.023 --> 10:23.955
or to do something.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.157
All right, now I'm
gonna have to ask you

10:26.159 --> 10:27.125
to put your phone on my desk.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.660
I didn't use my phone.

10:29.997 --> 10:32.764
All right. Define equivocate.

10:32.766 --> 10:35.934
To use ambiguous language so as to
conceal the truth or avoid committing--

10:35.936 --> 10:38.803
- Obdurate.
- Stubbornly refusing to change one's opinion

10:38.805 --> 10:40.705
- or course of action.
- Officious.

10:40.707 --> 10:43.875
Assertive of authority in an
annoyingly domineering way--

10:43.877 --> 10:45.677
Did you memorize
all of the SAT words?

10:46.013 --> 10:49.247
No, I don't think so.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.916
These are words that I
just looked up on Google.

10:51.918 --> 10:54.953
So, they're just
Google definitions.

10:54.955 --> 10:57.288
I'm not sure how they relate
to the Merriam-Webster's

10:57.290 --> 10:59.791
- or the Oxford--
- Yo, how many words did you look up?

10:59.793 --> 11:01.393
Like a hundred?

11:01.395 --> 11:05.864
No, 7,346.

11:05.866 --> 11:08.033
What?

11:18.679 --> 11:21.146
You need to be asleep, sir.

11:21.148 --> 11:23.081
I will in a minute.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.282
Is your brother asleep?

11:24.284 --> 11:25.216
Yeah.

11:31.858 --> 11:32.791
Come on.

11:43.470 --> 11:47.706
When you met him, was he happy?

11:51.178 --> 11:53.478
Yes, he was.

11:54.781 --> 11:55.914
Always.

12:02.122 --> 12:03.288
But then he wasn't.

12:03.290 --> 12:09.794
Baby look, it's too late to be
asking me difficult questions.

12:12.032 --> 12:13.164
Now go.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.500
I'll be in in a
minute to tuck you in.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.802
I'm not a baby.

12:17.804 --> 12:20.205
No, but you're my baby.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.410
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.956
- This has got to stop.
- Everything okay, Mr. Hume?

12:37.958 --> 12:40.225
Emmett, yes.
No, everything's fine.

12:40.227 --> 12:42.293
I just misplaced my wallet.

12:42.295 --> 12:44.162
- Okay.
- Okay.

12:50.470 --> 12:53.371
How could you, Emmet?
Did you finish the homework?

12:53.373 --> 12:57.308
- No can do.
- Come on, dude.

12:57.310 --> 13:00.945
I offered you a
deal and you declined.

13:01.515 --> 13:03.114
It's blackmail.

13:03.116 --> 13:07.418
Look, I can't let you drive the car.
Mom would kill me, man.

13:07.420 --> 13:11.055
Then explain to Manatee over here why
you're not turning in your homework today

13:11.057 --> 13:14.492
- and why you're gonna have to--
- Hey! Did someone here just--

13:14.494 --> 13:16.060
did someone just call me
Manatee again?

13:16.062 --> 13:19.130
Did I hear that again?
It is Mr. Hume.

13:19.132 --> 13:24.936
It's on the chalkboard if you forgot.
Okay? I'm not a manatee, okay?

13:24.938 --> 13:28.239
I don't know if it's 'cause of my big
nose, which is genetic, okay?

13:28.241 --> 13:30.909
Actually turns out I have a small head.
So joke's on you.

13:30.911 --> 13:32.577
There's nothing about
me like a manatee,

13:32.579 --> 13:35.280
except for my weight,
and my whiskers.

13:35.282 --> 13:38.116
So if I hear it again,
we're gonna bring back Friday pop quizzes.

13:38.118 --> 13:42.520
Who wants that? Does anyone want
the Friday pop quizzes? No?

13:42.522 --> 13:44.122
I didn't think so!

13:46.126 --> 13:47.525
Okay, fine.

13:47.527 --> 13:49.027
All right, you
can drive us home.

13:49.029 --> 13:50.995
All right, okay, everyone
open your books please

13:50.997 --> 13:52.130
to page 46.

13:52.132 --> 13:53.364
Here you go.

13:53.366 --> 13:54.365
How'd you know I
was gonna say yes?

13:55.869 --> 13:59.037
You're my brother
therefore an easy mark.

13:59.039 --> 14:03.074
Mr. Emmett Charles is gonna walk us through
a little something called surface tension.

14:08.481 --> 14:09.614
Emmett.

14:09.616 --> 14:11.916
Sorry, sorry, Mr. Hume.

14:11.918 --> 14:14.152
I just had a favorite
French film marathon

14:14.154 --> 14:17.222
this weekend and it's
just so hard to let go.

14:20.327 --> 14:23.628
- Emmett.
- The easiest way to understand surface tension

14:23.630 --> 14:26.497
is with a cork and
a glass of water.

14:30.337 --> 14:35.006
Look, just pay attention
and be careful, all right?

14:36.076 --> 14:37.942
Ooh, this baby purrs like a--

14:37.944 --> 14:40.278
Don't, all right.

14:40.280 --> 14:43.014
Look, you know nothing
about cars, okay?

14:43.016 --> 14:44.282
Just don't.

14:46.519 --> 14:49.020
Look, just focus on the driving.

14:49.022 --> 14:50.421
All right, that's
all I wanna see.

15:02.369 --> 15:05.103
Hey, put two hands on
the wheel, ten and two.

15:05.105 --> 15:06.304
Get your head in the car!

15:06.306 --> 15:07.405
I mean, you can't
even reach the pedals.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.539
Emmett.

15:31.564 --> 15:33.431
Emmett, turn the radio down!

15:37.604 --> 15:39.203
Move, quick!

15:41.174 --> 15:43.041
Over, over, over.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.375
No, ow!

15:45.045 --> 15:46.344
Ow.

15:49.249 --> 15:55.453
Looks like a 453
with a side of doh! Ooh.

15:55.455 --> 15:59.424
- Mm-mm.
- This dog'll hunt. No need for a wrecker.

15:59.426 --> 16:02.560
<i>Got you, Floyd,
notated. Thank you, over.</i>

16:02.562 --> 16:04.629
All right, son?

16:04.631 --> 16:06.364
Well, it looks like
you've got yourself

16:06.366 --> 16:08.366
quite a clunker, here.

16:11.371 --> 16:13.338
Look, I was driving, all right?

16:13.340 --> 16:15.540
Wait, no, wait I was--

16:15.542 --> 16:17.375
Look, there's no upside to it.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.210
There's no upside to
telling the truth.

16:19.212 --> 16:20.745
All right, I'm supposed
to be the responsible one.

16:20.747 --> 16:22.380
You're just a kid.

16:24.150 --> 16:27.018
If anyone's asking,
I was driving.

16:32.759 --> 16:35.293
Why don't you take a cue
from your brother, Luke?

16:35.295 --> 16:37.095
Get some homework done
while you're waiting.

16:37.097 --> 16:38.529
I like to do my
homework at home.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.018
Hey, I'm so sorry.

16:44.019 --> 16:45.502
I had to wait for another
nurse to cover my shift.

16:45.505 --> 16:46.738
Not a problem, Mrs. Charles.

16:46.740 --> 16:48.206
Let's go guys.

16:48.208 --> 16:49.507
Let's not keep Ms.
Ally any longer.

16:50.377 --> 16:51.609
Sorry, Ms. Ally.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.578
You don't worry, Emmett.

16:53.580 --> 16:55.680
Just get some rest for the
state debates and the SATs.

16:57.217 --> 16:59.317
Luke, don't text and drive.

17:00.720 --> 17:01.652
Yep.

17:04.257 --> 17:06.290
Sorry for all the
trouble, Ms. Ally.

17:07.359 --> 17:08.425
No problem.

17:24.176 --> 17:27.512
Yeah, yeah.

17:29.315 --> 17:30.248
I know.

17:34.587 --> 17:35.620
Let's study.

18:12.125 --> 18:14.792
Wow, man.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.567
Hey, not bad, Emmett.

18:22.569 --> 18:24.268
You don't suck nearly as bad
as Luke said you would.

18:24.270 --> 18:27.672
Well, we didn't see a Tonya
Smith or a school bus.

18:28.241 --> 18:29.640
Where are you guys goin'?

18:29.642 --> 18:31.509
We might go see
Craig in the Ward.

18:32.812 --> 18:33.744
Probably not, man.

18:33.746 --> 18:35.413
Luke, I thought I told you--

18:35.415 --> 18:37.849
Look it's, it's fine.
We're fine.

18:37.851 --> 18:39.650
We're not gonna go
there, all right?

18:39.652 --> 18:42.687
Okay. See you here, seven.

18:42.689 --> 18:45.389
- Yeah! Seven.
- Okay? Seven, right. Okay.

18:53.700 --> 18:58.736
<i>♪ You told me
You'll be going away ♪</i>

19:00.907 --> 19:05.610
<i>♪ We'll be seeing each other
Other days ♪</i>

19:09.716 --> 19:11.582
<i>- ♪ Sweet spin ♪</i>
- Okay.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.718
<i>♪ My hands have constant ♪</i>

19:13.720 --> 19:14.652
Sorry.

19:15.455 --> 19:19.223
Uh, yeah, he's not usually late.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.593
He's got these friends
that make him late.

19:22.595 --> 19:26.631
Oh. Do they lock him in a
room and tie him up?

19:26.633 --> 19:27.565
No.

19:28.535 --> 19:31.636
Then they don't make him late.

19:31.638 --> 19:33.204
How old are you?

19:34.274 --> 19:36.174
Old enough.

19:36.176 --> 19:37.375
For what?

19:37.377 --> 19:39.443
Okay, yeah, I understand.

19:39.445 --> 19:42.513
I'm 12, and yeah, I'm
immature and weird.

19:42.515 --> 19:43.447
I get it.

19:44.517 --> 19:45.683
If you say so.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.720
What is that?

19:49.722 --> 19:52.723
Oh, this is a new book
that I'm working on.

19:52.725 --> 19:54.225
A mystery.

19:54.227 --> 19:55.326
Oh.

19:55.328 --> 19:57.662
Scooby Doo or Sherlock Holmes?

19:59.332 --> 20:00.698
Sherlock Holmes.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.333
Yeah, I was gonna say.

20:02.335 --> 20:03.834
True crime.

20:05.205 --> 20:07.471
Okay, that's my mom.

20:07.473 --> 20:08.639
- Oh.
- Thank you.

20:08.641 --> 20:09.874
Thanks Mrs. Locke, all right?

20:09.876 --> 20:11.976
- All right, bye.
- Bye.

20:22.288 --> 20:23.387
What's wrong?

20:25.825 --> 20:28.626
Mikey got caught trespassing.

20:29.796 --> 20:32.430
He told the officer he
thought the house was empty.

20:32.432 --> 20:34.765
It wasn't, so he's
being kept overnight.

20:35.468 --> 20:37.001
Hey, what about Luke?

20:37.003 --> 20:38.603
Luke stayed in the car.

20:39.405 --> 20:40.538
Thank God.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.441
They won't press charges.

20:43.442 --> 20:45.309
But, uhm, we have to go
and pick him up.

20:45.878 --> 20:48.346
Okay, well, Mom, it's okay.

20:48.348 --> 20:49.614
If he stayed in the car,

20:49.616 --> 20:51.349
- then it should be fine.
- No, no it's not okay.

20:51.818 --> 20:54.318
What if he had gone
in that house, hm?

20:55.455 --> 20:57.521
What if the homeowner had a gun?

20:58.992 --> 21:00.925
Mikey's been getting in
trouble since the third grade,

21:00.927 --> 21:04.662
but I can't blame Mikey
because Luke chose

21:04.664 --> 21:05.997
to be there with him.

21:08.401 --> 21:10.501
The choices you both
make will affect

21:10.503 --> 21:12.436
the rest of your lives.

21:14.274 --> 21:17.308
The friends you hang out
with, all of that matters.

21:24.050 --> 21:25.316
Okay.

21:25.318 --> 21:26.484
Look over your shoulder!

21:26.486 --> 21:27.852
Look over your shoulder!

21:27.854 --> 21:30.054
Fear, horror, pain, death!

21:31.324 --> 21:32.857
Okay, you got it?

21:32.859 --> 21:35.326
You five try it. More fear.

21:35.328 --> 21:36.661
- Go.
- Ms. Jensen,

21:36.663 --> 21:38.596
how does this relate
to Thanksgiving?

21:38.598 --> 21:43.000
Wow, to be young and
innocent again like you, Joy.

21:43.603 --> 21:45.219
I mean think about it.

21:45.220 --> 21:46.836
It is a turkey holocaust
every November.

21:46.839 --> 21:48.973
You don't think those
birds know it's coming?

21:48.975 --> 21:50.641
Have some empathy, Joy.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.810
Think-- Hi.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.946
Woo, it's hot out here.

21:55.948 --> 21:56.931
- Ew.
- I'm dehydrated.

21:56.932 --> 21:57.915
- Wow, so where were we?
- Ew.

21:57.917 --> 22:00.851
Be afraid, be afraid,
move it, go!

22:27.647 --> 22:29.413
You're so good.

22:29.415 --> 22:31.482
You have such a mastery
of the instrument.

22:31.484 --> 22:34.051
I wish.
My sister, she was first chair

22:34.053 --> 22:37.655
by the time she was in 9th
grade, so I'm way behind.

22:37.657 --> 22:41.058
You're not your sister
and you're exceptional.

22:41.060 --> 22:43.060
Well, I wish I had
your confidence.

22:44.731 --> 22:46.097
I'm totally insecure.

22:46.766 --> 22:52.103
I'm small and I'm young,
and I don't fail, ever.

22:52.672 --> 22:55.840
And what's wrong with that?

22:55.842 --> 22:58.442
It just doesn't seem
like it's a good thing.

22:58.444 --> 23:00.745
How can someone who
never fails be insecure?

23:00.747 --> 23:02.079
I'm really insecure,

23:02.081 --> 23:05.649
but I have confidence
in my insecurity.

23:06.085 --> 23:09.019
It's a healthy insecurity.

23:09.021 --> 23:12.957
I know what I know and
I know what I learn,

23:12.959 --> 23:14.892
and I know what I love.

23:16.796 --> 23:17.962
I know my heart.

23:20.566 --> 23:21.565
Play it again.

23:59.071 --> 24:00.838
- Bye.
- Bye. See you.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.072
We heard you.

24:13.519 --> 24:17.021
- Tonya, did you do the math homework?
- Yeah, yeah, I did.

24:17.023 --> 24:21.959
See, I didn't do it,
so do you mind if I could see yours?

24:21.961 --> 24:24.628
Yeah, I do actually.

24:47.153 --> 24:49.553
- Don't talk to her. Don't look at her, don't touch her.
- What's happening right now?

24:49.555 --> 24:51.655
- I think it's a fight. -Oh my God.
- What are you doing?

24:51.657 --> 24:53.924
Get off me. Get off!

24:53.926 --> 24:54.959
What are you doing?

24:57.063 --> 24:57.928
Dude, come on.

25:00.700 --> 25:01.765
Come on!

25:01.767 --> 25:05.202
I'm gonna bring it home and
I'm gonna put it to bed.

25:05.204 --> 25:06.504
Bring what home?

25:06.506 --> 25:10.140
Emmett, what are you doing?
Come on!

25:11.143 --> 25:14.245
This is just what the doctor ordered.
Today has been so boring.

25:14.247 --> 25:15.746
Are you made out of
paper or what?

25:15.748 --> 25:17.948
- More like <i>papier-mâché.</i>
- What?

25:17.950 --> 25:21.085
- Cut it out.
- Don't worry, everyone, I am fine.

25:21.087 --> 25:25.523
Mac is Malfoy to my Potter. He hit me on the
mouth and our vascular systems are such--

25:25.525 --> 25:29.293
He jumped on me, all right? Look,
I didn't mean to hit you. You jumped on me.

25:29.295 --> 25:30.961
Are you kidding me?
Please get off.

25:30.963 --> 25:32.596
I'm not gonna
fight you, you're a child.

25:32.598 --> 25:38.769
- Can somebody please get this kid off of me?
- What is this sadness?

25:38.771 --> 25:42.740
- You're just mad that I won the regionals.
- No, I'm not.

25:42.742 --> 25:44.675
Okay, I still get to go
to State. I'll beat you there.

25:44.677 --> 25:46.977
Ha, in your dreams, sir,
in your dreams.

25:46.979 --> 25:48.579
Leave him alone.

25:52.051 --> 25:54.118
Emmett, this isn't really going

25:54.120 --> 25:55.920
the way you wanted it to, right?

25:55.922 --> 25:57.821
Yeah, why don't you let go
and we can talk about it?

25:57.823 --> 25:59.823
Emmett, he doesn't wanna fight.
Just get off.

25:59.825 --> 26:02.192
- Yeah, come on.
- Seriously.

26:05.998 --> 26:06.964
Yeah.

26:11.070 --> 26:12.002
Have fun.

26:12.004 --> 26:13.737
I was right about him.

26:13.739 --> 26:17.274
Oh!

26:17.276 --> 26:20.978
Oh, Emmett, I'm sorry.

26:20.980 --> 26:22.780
- Here.
- Hey! Hey!

26:22.782 --> 26:24.214
Luke, wait, wait, wait!

26:24.216 --> 26:25.149
Oh!

26:26.152 --> 26:27.284
Ow.

26:28.854 --> 26:30.588
Are you okay, Emmett?

26:30.590 --> 26:33.624
- I was just trying to help him.
- Let me see it, Emmett.

26:34.126 --> 26:35.826
You all right, bro?

26:39.832 --> 26:41.298
Thank you
both for coming in.

26:41.300 --> 26:43.267
All right,
come on, let's go, Mac.

26:47.773 --> 26:49.273
It really isn't up to me now.

26:49.275 --> 26:52.242
It's gotta go to a
parent-teacher council.

26:52.244 --> 26:54.845
Why do you need a
council or a committee

26:54.847 --> 26:56.880
to see that Mac is a bully?

26:56.882 --> 26:58.616
Emmett, it is my understanding

26:58.618 --> 27:01.151
that you started the fight.

27:01.153 --> 27:02.820
Mac will be suspended,
and unfortunately,

27:02.822 --> 27:05.289
the same thing will
be true for Luke.

27:05.291 --> 27:07.224
This is just very poor timing.

27:07.226 --> 27:10.194
We're about to announce an ongoing
investigation at the school,

27:10.196 --> 27:12.796
and it doesn't look good for
anyone when you come in here--

27:12.798 --> 27:14.164
What kind of investigation?

27:14.166 --> 27:16.800
There's been a rash of thefts.

27:16.802 --> 27:18.068
Oh, I get it.

27:18.070 --> 27:19.503
Don't you see?

27:19.504 --> 27:20.937
We're in trouble, now
we're automatically

27:20.940 --> 27:22.039
suspects in another case.

27:22.041 --> 27:23.040
Suspects?

27:23.042 --> 27:26.010
No, nobody is a suspect.

27:26.012 --> 27:27.645
All I'm saying is
it's a bad time

27:27.647 --> 27:29.947
to call attention to yourself
with negative behavior.

27:29.949 --> 27:32.316
Bad for you, bad for Mac.

27:32.318 --> 27:33.817
Bad for everyone.

27:33.819 --> 27:35.085
And this is the second time

27:35.087 --> 27:36.987
you've been in my
office this week.

27:36.989 --> 27:40.124
Would you like to silence
your cell phone, Luke?

27:40.126 --> 27:42.660
Oh, it's not mine.

27:43.963 --> 27:44.895
I found it.

27:51.837 --> 27:53.804
I don't want it anymore.

27:56.809 --> 27:59.243
But Dad wanted you to have it.

27:59.245 --> 28:00.844
We don't know what Dad wanted.

28:07.887 --> 28:10.087
Do you think I'm like him?

28:11.957 --> 28:12.990
What, Dad?

28:13.993 --> 28:14.925
Yeah.

28:17.063 --> 28:22.399
It's like Dad was really
smart, and I'm really smart.

28:24.270 --> 28:27.104
Then couldn't I
have what he had?

28:29.775 --> 28:32.209
Well, you're not
like him like that.

28:34.113 --> 28:37.748
You only got the good stuff,
and I only the good stuff.

28:39.385 --> 28:40.784
You don't know that.

28:42.221 --> 28:44.221
Well, if something
starts to happen

28:44.223 --> 28:46.190
or you feel really sad then...

28:46.192 --> 28:47.925
What if I see things?

28:49.795 --> 28:50.828
Like what?

28:52.465 --> 28:55.432
Like my imagination.

28:56.936 --> 28:58.802
It leaks out of my head.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.106
That's not the same.

29:03.309 --> 29:04.408
Dad was sick.

29:05.311 --> 29:06.944
You're just strange.

29:15.855 --> 29:18.489
Mom wants me to go to a
private school in Maine.

29:18.491 --> 29:19.423
What?

29:20.226 --> 29:21.992
But you didn't do anything.

29:23.429 --> 29:25.829
Between Mikey and
the phone, I mean,

29:25.831 --> 29:27.831
- they think I stole everything.
- But you didn't.

29:30.536 --> 29:32.503
I should have just left
that phone in the hall.

29:33.372 --> 29:34.838
I should have just kept walking.

29:46.519 --> 29:47.985
You can't go.

29:48.788 --> 29:50.053
I won't let you go.

29:56.362 --> 29:59.997
<i>♪ Father, father, father ♪</i>

30:02.568 --> 30:06.570
- Hey, T, we need to talk.
- I'm not your girlfriend.

30:06.572 --> 30:10.574
- Okay, I don't belong to you or to anyone else.
- I know, and I respect--

30:10.576 --> 30:13.977
And if I was your girlfriend, I would so
break up with you for that kind of behavior.

30:13.979 --> 30:17.815
- But Mac is a jerk.
- But he didn't physically attack you for no good reason.

30:17.817 --> 30:22.319
- No, but he just attacks with insults and nuanced slights.
- Emmett. Emmett.

30:22.321 --> 30:25.055
- And passive aggressive behavior.
- You're 12, okay?

30:25.057 --> 30:27.124
You can't control
everything and everyone.

30:27.560 --> 30:29.927
You have so many
expectations for people

30:29.929 --> 30:32.429
because, well, you're perfect.

30:32.431 --> 30:33.964
The rest of us aren't.

30:34.266 --> 30:35.933
You need to act
less like an adult

30:35.935 --> 30:37.501
and more like a kid, Emmett.

30:38.003 --> 30:42.439
Uh, but-- Being a kid means
being powerless and supine.

30:42.441 --> 30:44.274
It means being immature!

30:44.276 --> 30:45.509
Why would I want that?

30:45.511 --> 30:47.377
Why would anybody want that?

30:49.381 --> 30:52.482
So Selma, any chance that
this was an inside job?

30:52.484 --> 30:54.284
You may call me Ms. Ally,

30:54.286 --> 30:56.520
and I don't have time for
ludicrous conspiracies.

30:59.291 --> 31:02.092
Tell me about the old
computers in storage.

31:02.094 --> 31:03.427
They weren't even worth storing.

31:03.429 --> 31:05.229
Whoever stole them
did us a favor.

31:05.231 --> 31:07.297
And besides, Larry said--

31:08.100 --> 31:10.500
- Well I'm sure it's nothing.
- What's nothing?

31:10.502 --> 31:13.270
Well, Larry asked me about those
computers a couple of months ago.

31:13.272 --> 31:14.404
He said they were
worthless and he wanted

31:14.406 --> 31:16.273
to know if he could have them.

31:16.275 --> 31:19.376
- Larry Hume?
- Yes, I just thought of that.

31:19.378 --> 31:24.047
- He's a good man, Hume, even with his colorful past.
- Colorful past?

31:24.049 --> 31:27.417
You know I think you should
really talk to him directly.

31:27.419 --> 31:28.652
So you don't believe
that Luke Charles

31:28.654 --> 31:31.188
found that iPhone
in the hallway, huh?

31:31.190 --> 31:32.556
I don't.

31:32.558 --> 31:33.957
I hate to believe the narrative

31:33.959 --> 31:35.525
society creates for
a kid like Luke,

31:35.527 --> 31:37.995
but all of the
evidence is there.

31:37.997 --> 31:40.597
The narrative that--
for a kid like Luke?

31:40.599 --> 31:43.066
Selma, Selma!
You're never going to believe--

31:43.569 --> 31:45.435
Carol, everything's fine.

31:45.437 --> 31:46.970
The detective was just leaving.

31:47.373 --> 31:49.473
It's him or me.

31:50.376 --> 31:51.308
Okay.

31:52.611 --> 31:54.344
This is the one.

31:54.346 --> 31:56.013
Okay, Eddie, listen.

31:57.016 --> 31:59.216
If you are still not
getting it by Friday,

31:59.218 --> 32:01.518
I can meet you here
at six after football.

32:01.520 --> 32:02.953
Okay.

32:02.955 --> 32:04.454
Me, dumb football player.

32:04.456 --> 32:07.424
No. Do not perpetuate
that stereotype.

32:07.426 --> 32:09.593
It doesn't do anyone any favors.

32:09.595 --> 32:11.929
Okay, just keep working
on that one problem.

32:11.931 --> 32:14.464
Okay, thanks, Mrs. Locke.

32:14.466 --> 32:15.632
Here you go, Ms. Locke.

32:15.634 --> 32:17.434
Laura.

32:17.436 --> 32:18.402
Wow, that's great!

32:19.605 --> 32:22.039
Okay, so see, all
that extra hard work

32:22.041 --> 32:25.142
- that we've been putting in has been paying off, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

32:25.144 --> 32:27.444
So you just keep working
on those daily vocab drills

32:27.446 --> 32:29.313
and have a good night.

32:30.249 --> 32:31.949
Thank you.

32:35.354 --> 32:36.954
Hey Emmett, you need something?

32:44.063 --> 32:45.662
Should you be drinking coffee?

32:46.198 --> 32:48.532
I've been caffeinating
since I was nine.

32:48.534 --> 32:50.968
Caffeinating.

32:50.970 --> 32:54.604
Okay, so, I know that you
think that your brother

32:54.606 --> 32:59.142
didn't steal anything,
but I still don't know

32:59.144 --> 33:00.377
how I can be helpful.

33:01.313 --> 33:02.612
You seem like a kind person.

33:02.614 --> 33:03.513
Mm, thank you.

33:03.515 --> 33:05.749
A forgotten person.

33:05.751 --> 33:09.152
And you have access to a world
I can't even understand.

33:09.154 --> 33:11.388
Okay.

33:11.390 --> 33:14.391
I'm gonna forget the
forgotten person comment,

33:14.393 --> 33:18.395
but I wanna know
what is this world

33:18.397 --> 33:20.597
that you think I have access to?

33:20.599 --> 33:23.567
Okay, well, you write
crime novels for one.

33:23.569 --> 33:25.669
You understand how to
solve complex problems,

33:25.671 --> 33:28.038
and you have access
to the white world.

33:28.040 --> 33:30.307
- Oh!
- I don't have that.

33:30.309 --> 33:33.677
Access
to the white world?

33:33.679 --> 33:35.579
Yes, old white ladies get away

33:35.581 --> 33:37.581
with all kinds of
strange behavior.

33:37.583 --> 33:40.083
- You know it's true.
- Like what?

33:40.085 --> 33:41.785
Well, we're drinking
coffee in the library,

33:41.787 --> 33:45.255
which is not allowed, and
you're not supposed to park

33:45.257 --> 33:48.492
in the librarian's spot
- and you always do. -Yeah.

33:48.494 --> 33:50.560
And then you explain it like
your eyesight is goin' away

33:50.562 --> 33:54.131
or the sign is
too small or some nonsense.

33:54.133 --> 33:56.366
Well first of all, older people,

33:56.368 --> 33:58.802
no matter their race,
have bad eyesight.

33:58.804 --> 34:00.637
You could just start
dealing crystal meth

34:00.639 --> 34:04.141
and you'd get some kind of
humanitarian award for it.

34:04.143 --> 34:08.245
No, I don't think so.

34:09.514 --> 34:12.716
Just started a chain of events.

34:14.119 --> 34:17.187
I drove my brother's car, I
wrecked it, he took the blame.

34:18.524 --> 34:20.623
I just initiated all
this bad luck for him.

34:20.626 --> 34:26.496
No, bad luck is a concept,
not a foregone conclusion.

34:26.498 --> 34:29.632
And your brother makes
his own decisions.

34:29.635 --> 34:34.271
I know, but I'm responsible
for some part of this.

34:37.309 --> 34:39.275
I can't be without him.

34:39.678 --> 34:44.648
We're a good family,
together.

34:49.588 --> 34:51.254
I'm such a sucker.

34:52.357 --> 34:54.524
Okay, okay, I'll help you.

34:54.525 --> 34:56.860
Fine, I'll try.

34:59.331 --> 35:03.733
- I know a little bit about what's going on at that school.
- How?

35:03.735 --> 35:06.736
Eh, I have a friend in
the police department.

35:06.738 --> 35:11.174
Okay, we gotta figure out
who had opportunity.

35:11.877 --> 35:13.610
What about motive?

35:13.611 --> 35:15.344
No, opportunity
is easier to see.

35:15.781 --> 35:18.381
Okay, let's go
over your schedule,

35:18.383 --> 35:20.750
and can you read people?

35:20.752 --> 35:22.486
I read you.

35:22.488 --> 35:25.722
Honey, you have barely
glanced in my direction.

35:25.724 --> 35:27.691
I am an onion wrapped
in a layer cake

35:27.693 --> 35:29.593
wrapped in
a Terrence Malick film.

35:30.662 --> 35:32.295
Which Terry Malick film?

35:32.831 --> 35:33.830
<i>Badlands.</i>

35:37.136 --> 35:39.236
Maybe <i>Tree of Life.</i>

35:39.238 --> 35:41.872
Okay, why do I need to
be able to read people?

35:41.874 --> 35:43.707
Because we need to
weed out as many people

35:43.709 --> 35:45.542
as possible initially.

35:45.544 --> 35:47.544
Otherwise, everyone in
the school is a suspect.

35:47.546 --> 35:49.379
I mean I'm good at
seeing the detail

35:49.381 --> 35:51.915
and beauty in someone
who's usually overlooked.

35:52.651 --> 35:56.186
Okay, did you just make
all that up by yourself?

35:56.188 --> 35:58.455
I'm not bragging.
It's just a fact.

35:58.457 --> 36:04.761
Oh really? Mr. Smarty Smart-Stone,
why don't you tell me about me?

36:09.168 --> 36:12.769
Well, you were
married, you loved him.

36:13.839 --> 36:15.305
That's not so hard
to figure out.

36:16.675 --> 36:19.342
I know you're a hard worker.

36:19.578 --> 36:23.513
And you've carried
something for a long time,

36:24.750 --> 36:30.587
a need to repair things.
It's in your eyes.

36:30.589 --> 36:35.625
It's in-- it's in this room,
in between us now.

36:35.627 --> 36:38.595
You just don't like
to help people,

36:40.566 --> 36:42.432
it's like you have to.

36:43.902 --> 36:44.834
Hm.

36:47.372 --> 36:52.676
Okay, baby genius,
you've convinced me.

36:53.378 --> 36:54.878
Let's get to work.

36:55.647 --> 36:58.415
Like I was saying, opportunity.

36:58.417 --> 36:59.749
It's the first thing
I think about when

36:59.751 --> 37:01.518
I'm writing a novel.

37:01.520 --> 37:02.452
Oh, in here.

37:06.625 --> 37:10.227

I don't even know why

37:53.872 --> 37:56.039
I'm not ashamed of
my past, Detective.

37:56.041 --> 37:57.607
It's what makes
me a good teacher.

37:57.609 --> 37:58.775
All right I'm gonna show you

37:58.777 --> 38:00.477
where these computers were kept.

38:01.446 --> 38:03.280
I asked about 'em
'cause I wanted to see

38:03.282 --> 38:05.448
if we could use the drives
for a robotics club

38:05.450 --> 38:06.816
that takes place after school.

38:06.818 --> 38:08.785
I like to connect the
extracurriculars...

38:09.788 --> 38:11.872

- Ms. Jensen?
- I didn't have a class this period

39:01.406 --> 39:04.741
so I decided to
take some me time.

39:05.344 --> 39:06.776
School's over.

39:06.778 --> 39:07.744
Oh?

39:08.847 --> 39:11.047
Oh, it's Spartacus.

39:11.049 --> 39:14.017
The character
development is amazing

39:14.019 --> 39:18.521
and the fight sequences offer
some valuable choreography.

39:18.523 --> 39:19.789
It's not all like.

39:19.791 --> 39:21.958
Sure, sure, I get it.

39:21.960 --> 39:24.494
Would you like me to close this?

39:24.496 --> 39:25.829
Please, yes.

39:26.498 --> 39:28.765
- Okay.
- Goodbye, Emmett.

39:35.674 --> 39:37.774
Okay, we got multiple suspects

39:37.776 --> 39:39.909
but our main contender
is Mac Thompson.

39:39.911 --> 39:40.844
Okay.

39:40.846 --> 39:42.045
No!

39:43.014 --> 39:44.781
High school parties.

39:44.783 --> 39:46.583
A constantly revisited
rite of passage

39:46.585 --> 39:48.051
in literature and film.

39:48.587 --> 39:51.154
But when you look back,
were they even any fun?

39:52.090 --> 39:53.723
I take it you've
never been to one.

39:53.725 --> 39:55.692
Nope, not one.

39:55.694 --> 39:56.893
Okay.

40:01.933 --> 40:04.067
- Oh, wait.
- Hey, y'all.

40:04.069 --> 40:05.135
Who are you?

40:05.871 --> 40:07.470
Oh, they're here to help us.

40:07.472 --> 40:09.506
Weedee, Billy, this is Mary.

40:09.508 --> 40:10.607
Mrs. Locke.

40:11.543 --> 40:13.042
- Mary?
- Mary's fine.

40:13.044 --> 40:15.445
Hi, I'm William or Weedee.

40:15.447 --> 40:18.681
Weedee is better because Billy here
is also William, William Stanks.

40:18.683 --> 40:21.785
He's not insulting me. My name is
a full sentence: William Stanks.

40:21.787 --> 40:23.586
Thanks, Mom and Dad!

40:23.588 --> 40:25.121
It's very nice to
meet you, Mary.

40:25.123 --> 40:27.424
- Stanks.
- Mm-hm.

40:27.426 --> 40:28.491
Are we at a movie theater?

40:29.194 --> 40:31.528
Why are you eating
food in my car?

40:31.530 --> 40:33.096
Movie theater, good one.

40:33.098 --> 40:35.932
Where's the Milk Duds?

40:35.934 --> 40:38.902
My blood sugar's always been an issue
and if I don't have a snack within

40:38.904 --> 40:43.006
- a two hour window then I--
- Okay, forget it. Just don't spill anything.

40:43.008 --> 40:46.042
- Yeah, Billy.
- All right, I'm goin' upstairs to ransack Mac's room.

40:46.044 --> 40:48.978
Weedee and Billy run interference.
Mary, you'll be in the getaway car,

40:48.980 --> 40:50.146
you know, just in case
we need to--

40:50.148 --> 40:51.881
- What if Tonya's there?
- Who's Tonya?

40:51.883 --> 40:55.218
- Emmett's crush.
- No, don't listen to 'em.

40:55.220 --> 40:56.719
- Oh ho, ho, oh.
- She's just my friend.

40:56.721 --> 40:57.587
Obsession.

40:57.589 --> 40:59.556
Lois Lane to his Kal-El.

40:59.558 --> 41:01.024
Jane to his Tarzan.

41:01.026 --> 41:02.559
- Guys, stop.
- Elizabeth Bennett to his Darcy.

41:02.561 --> 41:03.927
- Guys.
- Sloane to his Ferris.

41:03.929 --> 41:05.562
- Scarlet to his Rhett Butler.
- No.

41:05.564 --> 41:06.830
Yes!

41:06.832 --> 41:08.031
- Ah!
- Stop, stop!

41:08.033 --> 41:11.868
Okay, I-I like her.

41:12.671 --> 41:13.803
Ooh!

41:14.873 --> 41:16.539
Don't do
anything I wouldn't do.

41:16.541 --> 41:17.774
Hey look, Mac's leaving.

41:20.045 --> 41:21.678
- All right, this is it. Let's go!
- Okay.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.580
Oh wait, wait. This never works.

41:23.582 --> 41:25.615
- He's coming right back.
- How do you know?

41:25.617 --> 41:27.150
Because I've seen a movie or two

41:27.152 --> 41:29.819
and I've written this
in all of my books.

41:29.821 --> 41:34.591
Someone always forgets something and then they
have to almost immediately come right back.

41:34.593 --> 41:35.992
She's right.

41:35.994 --> 41:37.994
We can't stay, we gotta go.

41:37.996 --> 41:39.629
- Come on.
- Yeah, and somebody always says that, too.

41:39.631 --> 41:40.997
Guys, come on.

41:43.034 --> 41:44.934
- Oy vey.
- Oh.

41:44.936 --> 41:48.071
- Come on!
- I'll go get some paper towels inside. Sorry.

41:48.974 --> 41:51.508
- Come on.
- I said I was sorry, okay?

41:53.111 --> 41:55.211
Hey, is anybody getting

41:55.213 --> 41:57.914
that overwhelmingly
ominous feeling?

41:57.916 --> 42:00.783
If it feels like acid reflux,
then yes, I've got it.

42:01.253 --> 42:03.052
Okay, text us if Mac comes back.

42:03.054 --> 42:04.687
That'll be in
about five minutes.

42:06.124 --> 42:07.624
Sorry, here you go.

42:15.734 --> 42:19.536
I'm out alone at night with
kids who are not my own

42:20.305 --> 42:22.605
sending them into a party
where there's alcohol

42:22.607 --> 42:24.007
and no adult supervision.

42:36.555 --> 42:37.854

43:01.846 --> 43:02.912

49:56.694 --> 50:01.397
Ho, hey, ho, hey!

50:02.367 --> 50:03.399
Oh my God.

50:03.401 --> 50:05.568
That was so awesome.

50:05.570 --> 50:07.036
You killed it, M.

50:07.038 --> 50:09.205
Well, hip hop is poetry.

50:09.207 --> 50:11.574
I mean Kendrick Lamar
won the Pulitzer.

50:12.510 --> 50:13.709
Hey, did you find anything?

50:13.711 --> 50:16.445
There were two hard drives
hooked up to two monitors

50:16.447 --> 50:18.047
and they were both running.

50:18.049 --> 50:19.582
He's encrypted the main drive,

50:19.584 --> 50:22.651
but they're online so
he's working on something.

50:22.653 --> 50:24.553
I just didn't have
time to figure it out.

50:24.555 --> 50:26.455
Billy checked the drive
that he dumped

50:26.457 --> 50:28.157
in the trash, but
there's nothing on it.

50:28.159 --> 50:29.492
It was completely scrubbed.

50:30.461 --> 50:33.596
I didn't see any jewelry
or phones or anything.

50:33.598 --> 50:35.631
Yeah, but that doesn't
mean it wasn't him.

50:35.633 --> 50:37.099
No, this is good.

50:37.535 --> 50:40.803
Oh boy, it means we have
solved a part of this.

50:40.805 --> 50:43.105
Yeah, but that doesn't
change anything for Luke.

50:43.107 --> 50:45.808
They still think that he stole
those purses and laptops.

50:46.711 --> 50:48.778
Well, don't you worry about it.

50:48.780 --> 50:51.180
We are gonna figure
this one out.

50:55.353 --> 50:56.519
What?

50:56.521 --> 50:58.254
- That wasn't open?
- Oh!

51:13.071 --> 51:14.737
Luke, Luke.

51:16.340 --> 51:17.440
God!

51:17.442 --> 51:20.376
Yo man, did you just float
in here or something?

51:20.378 --> 51:22.078
Make some noise, Twilight!

51:22.080 --> 51:22.845
Sorry, sorry.

51:22.847 --> 51:25.247
Man, it's really late, man.

51:25.249 --> 51:26.682
Go to sleep.

51:26.683 --> 51:28.116
You can solve cold fusion
tomorrow or something.

51:28.119 --> 51:31.687
Luke, Luke, I know how
to take responsibility

51:31.689 --> 51:35.257
for my actions, and I'm
going to tell Mom so we can--

51:35.259 --> 51:36.525
A, No.

51:37.195 --> 51:38.327
We can't talk
about this tonight.

51:38.329 --> 51:41.130
Two, I'm already asleep.

51:41.132 --> 51:43.499
And in conclusion please
wear a bell around your neck

51:43.501 --> 51:46.102
- so I can hear you come in next time.
- Sorry, sorry.

51:46.104 --> 51:50.439
Years, you just shaved
years off my life just now.

52:01.552 --> 52:03.586
I wanted you to know
what was about to happen

52:03.588 --> 52:05.554
before we made the announcement.

52:05.890 --> 52:07.857
Luke will be charged with theft.

52:15.633 --> 52:18.467
Why are the rules -different for me?
- What do you mean?

52:18.469 --> 52:21.804
Why didn't I get suspended
after I went after Mac?

52:21.806 --> 52:25.674
Why don't I ever get detention? I mean
I wanna grow up, but nobody will ever

52:25.676 --> 52:29.645
treat me like a grown up.
I get all this special treatment.

52:29.647 --> 52:33.415
You are an exceptional student and you've
never done anything to warrant suspension,

52:33.417 --> 52:36.552
- much less--
- No, I'm a meal ticket.

52:36.554 --> 52:39.822
- A meal ticket?
- I'm the golden goose at this school.

52:40.691 --> 52:42.625
How much do you think
fundraising will increase

52:42.627 --> 52:44.793
if the minority 12
year-old gets accepted

52:44.795 --> 52:46.362
to Harvard or Cornell next year?

52:47.165 --> 52:49.331
Dot told me you get
calls every week

52:49.333 --> 52:51.567
from colleges about
where I plan to apply.

52:51.569 --> 52:53.569
Dot, that woman is worth
her weight in garbage.

52:53.571 --> 52:55.204
Even if I do something wrong,

52:55.206 --> 52:57.773
it doesn't even matter because
I'm the big story here.

52:57.775 --> 53:00.709
What about the kids who
actually need a break?

53:00.711 --> 53:03.512
Everyone should be treated fairly and
I shouldn't be getting the special--

53:03.514 --> 53:06.682
Oh, shut up you whiny
little know it all!

53:10.254 --> 53:11.854
What do you wanna
be when you grow up?

53:12.490 --> 53:13.722
You're a good little debater.

53:14.225 --> 53:15.324
A lawyer, perhaps?

53:15.326 --> 53:18.961
You might find out that the
law is fluid, malleable.

53:18.963 --> 53:21.463
Different states mete out
justice differently.

53:21.465 --> 53:24.567
In this state, if a child
commits a serious offense

53:24.569 --> 53:25.634
they can be charged as an adult.

53:25.636 --> 53:26.936
Did you know that?

53:27.939 --> 53:31.473
So, if a deeper investigation
were to be undertaken,

53:31.909 --> 53:34.510
one a person in my
position could green light,

53:35.479 --> 53:38.347
Luke could be looking at some
pretty serious consequences

53:38.349 --> 53:40.449
for that little stunt he
pulled in the parking lot.

53:40.952 --> 53:44.286
Reckless endangerment,
felony property damage.

53:44.288 --> 53:46.455
We got the estimate
back from the mechanic

53:46.457 --> 53:48.657
for the school bus, and
that bill is teetering

53:48.659 --> 53:51.327
ever so close to the
felony threshold.

53:51.329 --> 53:55.631
A finger to the scales and Luke
wouldn't just be suspended.

53:55.633 --> 53:59.368
He'd be staring down jail time,
adult jail time.

53:59.370 --> 54:01.270
But you have no proof!

54:01.272 --> 54:02.638
Oh my God, wow.

54:03.674 --> 54:05.341
You really are naive.

54:05.676 --> 54:08.544
But I forget,
you're just a child.

54:09.313 --> 54:11.714
It would be a terrible
shame if Luke really did

54:11.716 --> 54:13.649
get in serious trouble
for an incident

54:13.651 --> 54:15.417
that seemed so out
of character for him.

54:15.886 --> 54:17.686
One that seemed more
like the actions

54:17.688 --> 54:19.488
of a very childish individual.

54:20.391 --> 54:21.824
Wouldn't you agree?

54:28.032 --> 54:29.832
Your brother is a loser.

54:29.834 --> 54:31.500
Your father was a loser.

54:31.836 --> 54:33.469
You're the only
winner in what's left

54:33.471 --> 54:34.870
of your pathetic little family,

54:34.872 --> 54:37.006
but you know that already,
don't you, Mr. Know-It-All?

54:41.379 --> 54:42.711
Run along now, Emmett.

54:44.749 --> 54:48.450
She's evil. She's like a combination
of Voldemort and General Zod

54:48.452 --> 54:49.985
if Voldemort didn't
need to kill Harry

54:49.987 --> 54:53.489
and was just running rampant
from the very beginning!

54:53.491 --> 54:55.758
And she dragged my father's
name through the mud.

54:55.760 --> 54:57.526
Well, that is awful.

54:57.528 --> 54:59.962
And how does she even know
anything about him anyway?

54:59.964 --> 55:02.698
I don't -wanna talk about it.
- Okay.

55:04.001 --> 55:06.568
She knows what happened to him.

55:06.570 --> 55:07.536
It's in my file.

55:08.005 --> 55:09.038
What happened to him?

55:09.573 --> 55:11.707
I don't wanna talk about it.

55:11.709 --> 55:12.708
Okay.

55:14.412 --> 55:17.379
I talked with a
therapist after he died.

55:17.381 --> 55:18.981
That's good.

55:18.983 --> 55:19.915
I guess.

55:22.019 --> 55:25.454
He didn't just die,
he killed himself.

55:27.091 --> 55:29.658
He had depression,
probably more.

55:29.660 --> 55:30.959
He was only 30.

55:30.961 --> 55:33.362
I was two and Luke was seven.

55:33.731 --> 55:36.031
I don't understand why
you'd wanna leave your kids.

55:36.701 --> 55:38.734
I don't think that's
what he wanted.

55:39.370 --> 55:41.704
It's usually more
complicated than that.

55:41.706 --> 55:43.639
Well, that's what it feels like.

55:45.009 --> 55:46.775
He was brilliant.

55:46.777 --> 55:48.744
People say I'm just like him.

55:48.746 --> 55:49.878
That's heavy.

55:50.448 --> 55:51.714
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

55:51.716 --> 55:52.981
Yeah.

55:52.983 --> 55:54.616
How am I supposed
to deal with that?

55:54.618 --> 55:57.619
I'm already facing the
cliché of growing up black

55:57.621 --> 55:59.088
without a father figure.

55:59.090 --> 56:01.924
Now I have to factor mental
illness into the whole thing.

56:01.926 --> 56:06.662
You know, we're not
like our parents.

56:07.131 --> 56:09.598
Well what about hereditary DNA?

56:10.434 --> 56:11.767
Okay, you got me there,

56:12.503 --> 56:15.838
but we don't inherit
everything from them.

56:15.840 --> 56:16.972
Let's hope.

56:16.974 --> 56:21.009
It seems my dad was also
an awful ping pong player.

56:21.011 --> 56:23.812
Well that's a little less
worrisome than bipolar disorder.

56:23.814 --> 56:24.913
I guess.

56:25.750 --> 56:27.616
Hey, let's go.

56:27.618 --> 56:28.917
We got a mystery to solve.

56:28.919 --> 56:30.686
Yeah, okay.

56:38.496 --> 56:40.963
Uh, do you have any
laptops or computers

56:40.965 --> 56:42.564
or anything like that
coming in lately?

56:42.566 --> 56:43.932
- No.
- No?

56:43.934 --> 56:45.567
Okay, onward.

56:49.907 --> 56:51.707
I'm looking for a laptop.

56:51.709 --> 56:52.775
- No.
- Computer?

56:52.777 --> 56:53.909
No.

56:53.911 --> 56:55.544
I don't know, watches?

56:55.546 --> 56:56.478
No, no.

56:56.480 --> 56:58.013
- Cell phone?
- Nah.

56:58.015 --> 56:59.581
All right, thank you.

56:59.583 --> 57:00.582
- Okay.
- Yeah.

57:00.584 --> 57:01.984
- Let's go.
- Okay.

57:01.986 --> 57:04.019
I kinda want that
little fat guy statue.

57:11.061 --> 57:12.828
I'm hungry and tired.

57:12.830 --> 57:13.929
Okay.

57:13.931 --> 57:15.731
And I wanna go.

57:15.733 --> 57:17.533
I wanna find this thing.

57:17.535 --> 57:18.934
I'm trying to catch a
case here, you're hungry.

57:18.936 --> 57:21.570
And I call bull because in space

57:21.572 --> 57:23.005
there's no oxygen so
you can't have flames

57:23.007 --> 57:24.873
trailing behind a spaceship.

57:24.875 --> 57:26.141
Fire in space.

57:26.811 --> 57:28.644
It's like getting the
egg before the chicken.

57:28.646 --> 57:30.846
Huh? Well, yeah I know but where

57:30.848 --> 57:32.848
did the first chicken
come from, man?

57:34.952 --> 57:36.185
Dude, I gotta go.

57:36.954 --> 57:38.787
See you at water aerobics.

57:39.757 --> 57:42.891
Hey, have any phones,
watches or laptops come in here recently?

57:42.893 --> 57:45.727
Yep, all of that, every week.

57:45.729 --> 57:46.995
It's right over here

57:46.997 --> 57:47.930
Okay.

57:49.733 --> 57:50.766
What's that?

57:55.172 --> 57:57.806
When did that trophy
from Hart High come in?

57:57.808 --> 57:59.208
Oh, a few weeks ago.

57:59.810 --> 58:01.610
- You remember who brought it in?
- No.

58:01.612 --> 58:04.613
- Any cell phones?
- Yeah, we have cell phones.

58:04.615 --> 58:06.982
You got cameras here,
running in the store for security?

58:06.984 --> 58:10.052
Yeah, pawn shop
equals high crime.

58:10.054 --> 58:12.020
We gotta have
constant surveillance.

58:12.022 --> 58:14.089
It's a standard little
thing we call technology.

58:14.091 --> 58:15.724
Can I take a look at that
surveillance footage?

58:15.726 --> 58:17.125
Who are you?

58:18.529 --> 58:20.896
I'm Detective Crockett
from the police department.

58:20.898 --> 58:22.664
And this is my intern

58:22.666 --> 58:24.967
from the criminal
system program justice.

58:24.969 --> 58:25.934
I'm Tubbs.

58:26.837 --> 58:28.136
That's the best you can do?

58:28.138 --> 58:30.005
I'm 12.

58:30.007 --> 58:32.975
The fact that I even know what
Miami Vice was is remarkable.

58:32.977 --> 58:35.244
It was the best work
Don Johnson ever did.

58:36.914 --> 58:37.913
Oh, okay.

58:42.052 --> 58:43.051
Follow me.

58:44.855 --> 58:46.588
Can't trust people
in a pawn shop.

58:47.925 --> 58:51.627
But this is exactly what I mean.
Access because of who you are.

58:51.629 --> 58:54.263
Oh, come on. Miss Manners
over there would give anybody

58:54.265 --> 58:56.198
access to the
surveillance footage.

58:56.200 --> 58:57.132
Seriously.

59:01.972 --> 59:03.572
Okay.

59:04.642 --> 59:06.909
- I'll need the last six weeks.
- Okay.

59:08.145 --> 59:10.045
It's that easy?

59:10.047 --> 59:11.747
Again, technology.

59:13.183 --> 59:15.851
The trophy, I can see you.

59:15.853 --> 59:16.718
Oh.

59:16.720 --> 59:18.020
All right.

59:18.022 --> 59:21.156
The trophy came in
the week of the 14th.

59:21.158 --> 59:22.824
I remember because I
had a lotta weird stuff

59:22.826 --> 59:24.059
come in that week.

59:24.061 --> 59:25.794
Here's the lady.

59:26.297 --> 59:28.330
Yep, she's holding it, you see?

59:29.667 --> 59:33.035
That's Miss Jensen,
the dance teacher at my school.

59:33.037 --> 59:36.038
Yep, I remember her.
She had this weird outfit on.

59:36.040 --> 59:37.940
It was like a fabric wet suit.

59:37.942 --> 59:38.974
Did she bring anything else in?

59:39.643 --> 59:42.044
Earlier that month,
not that day.

59:42.046 --> 59:43.278
And then she came
back a few days ago

59:43.280 --> 59:45.047
and bought some
of the stuff back.

59:45.049 --> 59:46.982
- She bought it back?
- Yeah.

59:47.618 --> 59:50.085
Huh, why would
she buy it back?

59:51.021 --> 59:53.055
So, how does
Mac fit into all of this?

59:53.624 --> 59:55.257
See that's the thing
I can't figure out.

59:55.259 --> 59:57.259
Mac has all the
computers and Jensen

59:57.261 --> 59:59.061
has all the personal items.

01:00:00.164 --> 01:00:01.630
- Oh, thank you.
- Here you go.

01:00:01.632 --> 01:00:03.665
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:00:03.667 --> 01:00:06.301
Could they both be thieves
and not know it?

01:00:06.971 --> 01:00:09.771
Is stealing like that
trendy right now?

01:00:10.874 --> 01:00:13.875
- Crime never goes out of style.
- Oh.

01:00:13.877 --> 01:00:17.746
Oh. I'm gonna use that as the
tagline for my next book.

01:00:18.649 --> 01:00:20.716
Oh wait, before I forget.

01:00:21.251 --> 01:00:25.087
I read these and I'd
like you to sign them.

01:00:25.923 --> 01:00:27.389
Okay.

01:00:27.391 --> 01:00:30.225
<i>Race to Beacon Hill</i>
is your best work.

01:00:30.227 --> 01:00:32.728
I can't believe the nun
was such a sociopath.

01:00:33.197 --> 01:00:35.063
It's so dark.

01:00:35.065 --> 01:00:37.065
Where does that come from?

01:00:37.067 --> 01:00:39.234
I don't know, where does any
good story really come from?

01:00:39.236 --> 01:00:41.970
The imagination peppered
with a little real life.

01:00:43.807 --> 01:00:46.074
But that nun exists.

01:00:46.076 --> 01:00:47.743
Do you know her?

01:00:47.744 --> 01:00:49.411
Every former Catholic school
girl knows an evil nun.

01:00:53.283 --> 01:00:56.952
So, what do all
your friends think

01:00:56.954 --> 01:00:59.221
about you hanging out with--

01:00:59.223 --> 01:01:00.822
An old white lady?

01:01:00.824 --> 01:01:02.958
Well I
wasn't gonna say that.

01:01:03.394 --> 01:01:07.029
You think I'd get as far with
all this if you were black?

01:01:07.364 --> 01:01:10.265
When people meet you,
you're not being judged.

01:01:10.267 --> 01:01:11.400
Except by you.

01:01:11.402 --> 01:01:13.619
Don't pretend like you
don't know what I mean.

01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:15.837
No, I know exactly
what you mean.

01:01:16.273 --> 01:01:18.106
And I also know that
someone who says

01:01:18.108 --> 01:01:19.975
that race doesn't matter
isn't being honest.

01:01:21.045 --> 01:01:23.412
But you're painting with a
really big brush here, Emmett.

01:01:24.715 --> 01:01:27.082
Do I meet your expectations
for an old white woman?

01:01:27.084 --> 01:01:28.750
Do I meet yours?

01:01:28.752 --> 01:01:31.687
For an old white woman? No.

01:01:31.689 --> 01:01:35.390
I'm just saying,
people are disappointing,

01:01:35.993 --> 01:01:38.927
and they say stupid things
and they do stupid things.

01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:43.031
We just need more discussion

01:01:43.033 --> 01:01:46.068
and more transparency,
less fear.

01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:49.037
And we shouldn't assume
so much about each other.

01:01:49.707 --> 01:01:53.408
Everyone's saying it, but how
do we actually do something

01:01:53.410 --> 01:01:55.744
that's going to
change the way that--

01:01:57.014 --> 01:01:57.979
Two.

01:01:59.950 --> 01:02:00.916
- Right this way.
- Thank you.

01:02:00.918 --> 01:02:05.320
What?
Hey, Emmett, where are you--

01:02:08.158 --> 01:02:10.492
- So this is the road you started--
- Emmett!

01:02:10.994 --> 01:02:12.160
- What are you doing here?
- Mm-hmm.

01:02:12.162 --> 01:02:14.930
I thought you were
at Weedee's house.

01:02:14.932 --> 01:02:16.465
Sam, this is my son Emmett.

01:02:16.467 --> 01:02:18.200
- Sam is--
- A man with whom

01:02:18.202 --> 01:02:20.168
you are engaging
in elbow politics

01:02:20.170 --> 01:02:22.104
and laughing with your mouths!

01:02:23.741 --> 01:02:25.273
Emmett, it's very
nice to meet you.

01:02:25.275 --> 01:02:28.110
How dare you say my name, sir.
Shame on you

01:02:28.112 --> 01:02:30.979
- for thinking you can--
- Mrs. Charles, I'm Mary, Emmett's--

01:02:30.981 --> 01:02:35.283
Lover. This woman is a girlfriend
with whom I am passionate.

01:02:35.285 --> 01:02:38.153
I have been writing <i>Notes On A
Scandal</i> with this woman for months.

01:02:38.155 --> 01:02:41.490
- What's good for the goose, huh, Mom?
- I am not a girlfriend.

01:02:41.492 --> 01:02:44.860
Emmett, if you would let anyone
explain, Sam is my boss.

01:02:45.162 --> 01:02:47.429
Oh my God, Emmett, what are you doing?

01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:49.798
You scoundrel. You huge jerk!

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:51.967
- Emmett!
- Come on, lover, we're leaving!

01:02:54.338 --> 01:02:58.406
I'm so, so sorry about all this.

01:02:58.909 --> 01:03:02.544
He's been upset with school
and his brother lately.

01:03:02.546 --> 01:03:04.079
- Mary?
- Yes.

01:03:04.081 --> 01:03:06.214
- This is Sam Evers, my boss.
- Hello.

01:03:06.216 --> 01:03:07.849
We work at the hospital.

01:03:07.851 --> 01:03:09.918
I'm starting medical
school in the fall,

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:11.570
so we were discussing that.

01:03:11.571 --> 01:03:13.221
Medical school? Congratulations.

01:03:13.223 --> 01:03:14.389
Thank you.

01:03:14.391 --> 01:03:16.925
I'm gonna go, I am so sorry.

01:03:16.927 --> 01:03:17.959
Sam, I will pay for
your dry cleaning.

01:03:17.961 --> 01:03:20.829
- Oh no--
- It's okay, I'm good.

01:03:20.831 --> 01:03:22.264
- Nice meeting you.
- It's no big deal.

01:03:22.266 --> 01:03:23.265
Sorry.

01:03:26.069 --> 01:03:27.068
Who doesn't love chocolate cake?

01:03:27.070 --> 01:03:28.403
Communists.

01:03:29.039 --> 01:03:30.338
You know, I was a
communist in college

01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:32.107
and I ate lots of cake.

01:03:32.109 --> 01:03:33.208
Hm?

01:03:35.946 --> 01:03:38.046
In college, I burned my bra.

01:03:40.517 --> 01:03:43.985
Would you consider
joining me for coffee?

01:03:48.525 --> 01:03:51.827
- Hm.
- Hm.

01:04:05.042 --> 01:04:06.074
I'm sorry.

01:04:06.076 --> 01:04:10.045
I didn't hear you say
he was your boss.

01:04:11.081 --> 01:04:13.114
Well, lucky for us he's nice.

01:04:14.284 --> 01:04:17.252
He'll forgive you,
and I forgive you.

01:04:18.956 --> 01:04:21.857
So, you'll be a doctor?

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:24.626
One day, yes.

01:04:28.432 --> 01:04:29.448
Why didn't you tell me?

01:04:29.449 --> 01:04:30.465
Well, I had to work it out
with the hospital first

01:04:30.467 --> 01:04:32.133
to see if I could keep my job

01:04:32.135 --> 01:04:34.035
and go to school
at the same time.

01:04:34.972 --> 01:04:37.405
If I can't, I won't be a doctor.

01:04:38.609 --> 01:04:40.642
I have to pay the bills
and take care of you two.

01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:42.878
That's my number one job.

01:04:44.414 --> 01:04:45.447
That's what the
meeting was about.

01:04:46.583 --> 01:04:48.183
And I ruined it.

01:04:48.485 --> 01:04:51.319
Well,
it was definitely

01:04:51.321 --> 01:04:56.391
more colorful than I expected,
but you didn't ruin it.

01:04:59.429 --> 01:05:01.096
Mom, I'm afraid.

01:05:03.367 --> 01:05:04.566
Afraid of what?

01:05:05.535 --> 01:05:09.004
If Luke leaves, I'll change.

01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:12.274
My brain will change.

01:05:14.011 --> 01:05:16.144
Oh.

01:05:17.047 --> 01:05:21.283
Are you afraid of shark attacks?

01:05:22.252 --> 01:05:25.020
In the abstract, yes.

01:05:25.656 --> 01:05:26.922
Well, it's the same thing.

01:05:26.924 --> 01:05:30.292
You're afraid of something
that may never happen.

01:05:31.428 --> 01:05:33.028
But you're aware of your fear.

01:05:33.030 --> 01:05:39.000
So, if you start to feel
something changing inside of you,

01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:41.636
you can do something about it.

01:05:43.407 --> 01:05:47.042
We can get you the help that
your dad never received.

01:05:48.712 --> 01:05:52.380
I wish I could go back

01:05:52.382 --> 01:05:55.417
and realize what was
happening to him,

01:05:55.419 --> 01:05:57.285
but I didn't understand it then.

01:05:58.622 --> 01:05:59.688
I do now.

01:06:01.091 --> 01:06:04.726
Whatever happens,
I'm gonna take care of you.

01:06:07.197 --> 01:06:08.296
Okay?

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.169
And Luke needs to be
somewhere where he can develop

01:06:14.171 --> 01:06:15.704
into who he's supposed to be.

01:07:44.628 --> 01:07:45.560
Hey.

01:07:57.107 --> 01:07:59.107
What did that cop want?

01:07:59.743 --> 01:08:01.276
Oh, he wanted to know if I would

01:08:01.278 --> 01:08:03.311
have breakfast with
him on Saturday.

01:08:05.615 --> 01:08:08.116
That's your friend in
the police department.

01:08:08.118 --> 01:08:10.151
Yes, he helps me with my novels.

01:08:10.153 --> 01:08:12.087
And he's telling
you what's happening

01:08:12.089 --> 01:08:13.254
on the other side of this.

01:08:16.292 --> 01:08:17.658
What is this?

01:08:17.661 --> 01:08:19.227
Your principal is going to try

01:08:19.229 --> 01:08:20.662
to press charges against Luke.

01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:23.631
What do we do?

01:08:24.301 --> 01:08:26.167
Well, we figure it out.

01:08:26.536 --> 01:08:29.136
That's her, that's Selma Ally.

01:08:34.544 --> 01:08:36.611
I never thought
I'd see her again.

01:08:37.781 --> 01:08:40.381
Wait, wait, who? Ms. Ally?

01:08:41.885 --> 01:08:43.852
Let's see where old Selma goes.

01:08:45.122 --> 01:08:49.524
What? Okay, is there anybody in
this town that you don't know?

01:08:49.526 --> 01:08:50.692
It's unlikely.

01:08:51.194 --> 01:08:52.694
Put on your seat belt,
Evil Knievel.

01:08:54.698 --> 01:08:57.232
When I knew her,
her name was Selma Murphy.

01:08:57.234 --> 01:08:59.134
I guess Ally is her maiden name?

01:09:05.809 --> 01:09:06.875
Look at her.

01:09:10.747 --> 01:09:13.615
I don't think
she's gonna see us.

01:09:17.587 --> 01:09:18.920
Her house is cute.

01:09:20.256 --> 01:09:23.224
Yeah, her old house
had blue shutters.

01:09:23.225 --> 01:09:24.725
Periwinkle, that was
her favorite color.

01:09:25.629 --> 01:09:27.328
I know this movie.

01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:28.930
t's called <i>Single White Female.</i>

01:09:30.567 --> 01:09:33.201
Listen.

01:09:33.537 --> 01:09:36.571
Selma Ally and I were
best friends.

01:09:38.375 --> 01:09:41.509
Yep, we were young mothers,
we lived next door to each other,

01:09:41.511 --> 01:09:43.645
my son played with her
son, Paul, all the time.

01:09:43.647 --> 01:09:45.446
We just did everything together.

01:09:46.416 --> 01:09:49.384
And I didn't know it,
but her husband, Ash--

01:09:49.386 --> 01:09:50.785
His name was Ash?

01:09:50.787 --> 01:09:52.353
Yes.

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:55.423
Such a cool name.

01:09:55.425 --> 01:09:57.425
I can already tell this
is gonna be a good story.

01:10:01.698 --> 01:10:02.864
Sorry, go ahead.

01:10:02.866 --> 01:10:05.466
You're probably too young
to hear this.

01:10:06.903 --> 01:10:08.269
- Come on.
- Okay.

01:10:08.271 --> 01:10:11.706
Well Ash, he was in
trouble with everyone.

01:10:11.708 --> 01:10:15.343
He gambled, he owed
people money, he drank,

01:10:15.345 --> 01:10:18.646
and he had a serious
thing for me.

01:10:19.683 --> 01:10:20.748
But you were married.

01:10:21.451 --> 01:10:22.784
Happily, yes.

01:10:24.321 --> 01:10:26.254
But it didn't stop
what happened.

01:10:26.890 --> 01:10:30.325
Oh, he was just one of
those kinds of men--

01:10:30.327 --> 01:10:34.896
The rogue, the hunk, the
cowboy, the swashbuckler,

01:10:34.898 --> 01:10:35.997
- the--
- Yes,

01:10:35.999 --> 01:10:38.499
some of those, but not all.

01:10:39.536 --> 01:10:40.868
I was a child.

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:45.273
I didn't understand
the amount of work

01:10:45.275 --> 01:10:47.575
you had to put into a marriage.

01:10:47.577 --> 01:10:50.278
I needed to be filled up
all the time.

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:54.482
I needed to look
forward to something.

01:10:54.484 --> 01:10:57.986
My husband couldn't give
me that, nobody could.

01:10:57.988 --> 01:11:00.755
Selma was my best friend.

01:11:00.757 --> 01:11:03.658
We spent days and
nights together.

01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:06.361
It's hard when you
have small children

01:11:06.363 --> 01:11:07.929
and what you thought
was the start

01:11:07.931 --> 01:11:10.665
of your life is actually an end.

01:11:11.368 --> 01:11:14.402
We could talk about that,
be a support for each other.

01:11:14.404 --> 01:11:18.339
We were at the beach,
all together.

01:11:18.341 --> 01:11:19.974
Ash was great fun.

01:11:19.976 --> 01:11:23.011
He loved to make a mess
and enjoy himself,

01:11:23.013 --> 01:11:25.280
and Selma was like that, too.

01:11:25.582 --> 01:11:27.382
We were drawn to them.

01:11:27.384 --> 01:11:29.851
It was always summer
and there was always

01:11:29.853 --> 01:11:32.053
something interesting going on.

01:11:32.055 --> 01:11:34.589
And that fills you
up for a while.

01:11:34.591 --> 01:11:36.658
We spent the night in
a wood framed cabin.

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:39.727
I went downstairs to
get a glass of water--

01:11:39.729 --> 01:11:42.030
And had an affair with
Selma Ally's husband.

01:11:42.532 --> 01:11:43.798
Mm-hm.

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.433
That's some low-down dirty--

01:11:45.435 --> 01:11:46.401
Yeah.

01:11:48.872 --> 01:11:49.871
It is.

01:11:51.374 --> 01:11:52.540
And it gets worse.

01:11:52.542 --> 01:11:54.375
How is that possible?

01:11:54.377 --> 01:11:56.594
Someone contract leprosy?

01:11:56.595 --> 01:11:58.812
After I finally got the courage
to tell Cal what happened

01:11:59.482 --> 01:12:01.816
we got in a fight,
a really bad one,

01:12:02.952 --> 01:12:06.788
and he walked out of the house,

01:12:06.790 --> 01:12:08.489
got in the car and drove off.

01:12:08.491 --> 01:12:10.325
He got hit by a drunk driver.

01:12:11.594 --> 01:12:14.762
He survived but he was
never the same again.

01:12:16.099 --> 01:12:18.933
We never spoke of it, and
about a year ago he died.

01:12:19.769 --> 01:12:22.670
I know that we had some
happy years together.

01:12:22.672 --> 01:12:24.772
You know, if this is
the type of stuff

01:12:24.774 --> 01:12:27.809
grown-ups do to each other,
I wanna be a kid forever.

01:12:27.811 --> 01:12:29.110
You're cruel.

01:12:29.979 --> 01:12:31.913
I don't wanna be cruel.

01:12:34.017 --> 01:12:36.651
I can't believe
you're a homewrecker.

01:12:36.653 --> 01:12:38.920
A 70 year-old home wrecker.

01:12:40.924 --> 01:12:43.658
I've made mistakes, one of which

01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:45.660
was telling you this story.

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:51.566
Emmett?

01:12:52.435 --> 01:12:54.135
You know I'm 61, right?

01:13:35.011 --> 01:13:36.511
Emmett?

01:13:36.513 --> 01:13:38.446
- Mary?
- Emmett.

01:13:38.448 --> 01:13:40.181
Wait, wait, wait, don't tell me,

01:13:40.183 --> 01:13:42.917
Mr. Hume is an old friend
from your roller derby days.

01:13:42.919 --> 01:13:44.419
No, he's in my book club.

01:13:44.421 --> 01:13:45.586
- Book club.
- Of course he is.

01:13:45.588 --> 01:13:46.788
We have to talk.

01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:48.856
Okay.

01:13:48.858 --> 01:13:50.925
My Nicey Icee customer
loyalty card is missing.

01:13:50.927 --> 01:13:53.694
- Okay.
- I was one icee away. I was one icee--

01:13:53.696 --> 01:13:55.930
- Larry, Larry. Take a breath.
- You've got to be kidding.

01:13:55.932 --> 01:13:58.599
- Where did you find the wallet?
- Jensen put it under a desk.

01:13:58.601 --> 01:14:02.870
That's when it hit me. We've lost
sight of what's right in front of us.

01:14:02.872 --> 01:14:05.506
- What?
- It's all the stuff that she bought back

01:14:05.508 --> 01:14:07.442
from the pawn shop.
She's returning it all.

01:14:07.811 --> 01:14:10.511
For some reason she's
trying to undo what she did.

01:14:10.513 --> 01:14:12.914
I think the thefts are a
distraction from something bigger.

01:14:13.683 --> 01:14:15.716
What could be bigger?
I mean, what else could it be?

01:14:15.718 --> 01:14:18.486
- Something we can't see.
- It's gotta be money.

01:14:18.488 --> 01:14:20.955
- What money?
- Parent-teacher fund?

01:14:20.957 --> 01:14:22.657
No, you know, we gotta
get into Ally's office.

01:14:22.659 --> 01:14:23.925
We gotta get into her computer.

01:14:23.927 --> 01:14:25.726
Oh, that sounds easy.

01:14:25.728 --> 01:14:27.128
I've got keys.

01:14:28.031 --> 01:14:31.699
Then it actually
does sound easy.

01:14:31.701 --> 01:14:32.834
Let's go.

01:14:32.836 --> 01:14:34.836
Okay, what are we looking for?

01:14:34.838 --> 01:14:36.571
Something that isn't right.

01:14:36.573 --> 01:14:38.773
Let's start with
these pillows, wow.

01:14:38.775 --> 01:14:41.542
Yes, thank you.
The palette in here is totally wrong.

01:14:41.544 --> 01:14:42.810
Oh please it's
like Santa Fe in the '80s.

01:14:42.812 --> 01:14:44.812
Okay, can we just stay focused?

01:14:44.814 --> 01:14:47.014
Okay, here we go.
Hey look, take a look at this.

01:14:47.016 --> 01:14:48.649
This is the parents'
fund accounts.

01:14:48.651 --> 01:14:49.917
We had a fundraiser at
the end of last year.

01:14:49.919 --> 01:14:51.118
Everything
here looks fine.

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:52.587
Have there been any withdrawals?

01:14:52.589 --> 01:14:55.022
Looks like
there were 22 payments

01:14:55.024 --> 01:14:57.225
over the last several months
to Paradise Construction?

01:14:57.227 --> 01:14:59.894
- Have there been repairs?
- No.

01:14:59.896 --> 01:15:02.129
You know what? This fund was
raised to fix gutters,

01:15:02.131 --> 01:15:04.065
roof, theater lighting,
all the big stuff.

01:15:04.067 --> 01:15:07.702
But the pipe in the hallway
closet is still leaking.

01:15:07.704 --> 01:15:08.803
And the roof is still a mess.

01:15:08.805 --> 01:15:12.640
I know! Oh, this is weird.

01:15:12.642 --> 01:15:15.643
I can't click through to get
information on the payments.

01:15:15.645 --> 01:15:17.278
What about the ledger?

01:15:18.982 --> 01:15:20.581
Here it is.

01:15:20.583 --> 01:15:23.684
Uh, uh-huh, I don't know what
I'm lookin' at.

01:15:25.154 --> 01:15:26.187
- Oh.
- Wait!

01:15:27.924 --> 01:15:29.590
I've seen this signature before.

01:15:29.959 --> 01:15:31.058
Wait, wait.

01:15:32.095 --> 01:15:35.229
- Selma Ally.
- Hi.

01:15:35.231 --> 01:15:36.764
Jensen and Mac.

01:15:36.766 --> 01:15:37.932
Mac's computer.

01:15:39.202 --> 01:15:40.668
- It's a mirror.
- What?

01:15:40.670 --> 01:15:42.270
- It's a mirror.
- What's a mirror?

01:15:42.272 --> 01:15:46.307
Okay, so this page is locked,
the page is locked.

01:15:46.309 --> 01:15:47.942
This is not a real website.

01:15:47.944 --> 01:15:49.176
- Oh man.
- We're pulling up

01:15:49.178 --> 01:15:50.845
a link to a different server.

01:15:50.847 --> 01:15:53.814
We're pulling this up from
the computers at Mac's house.

01:15:53.816 --> 01:15:55.049
Are you seeing what I'm saying?

01:15:55.051 --> 01:15:56.851
- Yes, I am.
- What?

01:15:56.852 --> 01:15:58.652
Yeah, if you try to
exit out, it won't work.

01:15:58.655 --> 01:16:00.988
- Press the red button right there.
- This is the mirror.

01:16:00.990 --> 01:16:02.156
- Right, right.
- Wait, wait.

01:16:02.158 --> 01:16:04.825
Selma Ally is an
evil mastermind.

01:16:04.827 --> 01:16:07.862
Mac definitely helped her
set all of this up.

01:16:07.864 --> 01:16:09.830
And the dance teacher
was the distraction.

01:16:09.832 --> 01:16:12.667
Miss Carol Jensen in
the role of a lifetime.

01:16:16.773 --> 01:16:17.738
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:16:19.075 --> 01:16:21.342
Uh, can I get a cheeseburger,
coffee to go.

01:16:21.344 --> 01:16:22.276
Sure.

01:16:25.982 --> 01:16:27.782
Order in.

01:16:27.784 --> 01:16:29.016
Yup, got it.

01:16:39.228 --> 01:16:41.028
What do you want, Mary?

01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:42.663
I don't know where to begin.

01:16:43.266 --> 01:16:44.632
I just, I--

01:16:46.903 --> 01:16:49.003
I just wanted to apologize.

01:16:50.206 --> 01:16:52.807
You're mistaking me for
someone who wants an apology.

01:16:54.944 --> 01:16:58.112
Okay, well then if you
won't take an apology,

01:16:58.114 --> 01:16:59.814
I'd like to at least
explain what happened.

01:16:59.816 --> 01:17:02.683
No, you don't get to do that.

01:17:03.219 --> 01:17:05.386
I was angry for a long time,

01:17:06.155 --> 01:17:07.688
but it was never
about the cheating.

01:17:08.224 --> 01:17:12.026
Long before you happened,
Ash and I were done.

01:17:12.028 --> 01:17:13.294
He had already accepted
the worst husband

01:17:13.296 --> 01:17:14.662
of the year award.

01:17:14.664 --> 01:17:17.965
I ought to be thanking you
for being the last straw.

01:17:18.368 --> 01:17:19.900
You weren't special, you know.

01:17:20.403 --> 01:17:22.703
There were ten other
women before you.

01:17:24.374 --> 01:17:27.041
Well, I've had a lot
of regret over this

01:17:27.043 --> 01:17:30.177
over the years and
I have to be done.

01:17:31.748 --> 01:17:34.281
I have to leave it in the
past, I have to move on.

01:17:37.286 --> 01:17:39.286
I wish you could understand...

01:17:40.356 --> 01:17:42.156
What, you're sorry?

01:17:42.158 --> 01:17:43.958
I don't care.

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:45.326
I don't give a crap
if you're sorry,

01:17:46.095 --> 01:17:47.995
and I'm not here to
make you feel better

01:17:47.997 --> 01:17:51.432
about what you did and make
it easier for you to move on.

01:17:52.235 --> 01:17:53.300
You ruined us.

01:17:56.239 --> 01:17:57.938
You don't even know.

01:17:59.175 --> 01:18:01.008
I never had a friend like you.

01:18:02.078 --> 01:18:03.711
You were my sister.

01:18:03.713 --> 01:18:06.180
Do you remember what it was
like when we were together?

01:18:06.683 --> 01:18:11.352
Well, those were the happiest times of
my life. You were the best part of me.

01:18:11.354 --> 01:18:14.088
And then you broke my heart by
never wanting to see me again.

01:18:14.791 --> 01:18:17.158
- I did wanna see you again.
- That's a lie.

01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:19.026
You never called me.

01:18:19.028 --> 01:18:20.194
Your shame wouldn't let you.

01:18:24.267 --> 01:18:25.166
You felt guilty.

01:18:25.167 --> 01:18:26.066
And then you came
to Ash's funeral

01:18:26.069 --> 01:18:27.902
with your crippled husband.

01:18:27.904 --> 01:18:30.337
I bet you felt really
proud of yourself that day,

01:18:30.339 --> 01:18:34.308
showing your face, owning the
misery you caused in so many lives.

01:18:35.178 --> 01:18:40.748
But my heart sank the moment I knew that
you weren't there for me, to win me back.

01:18:43.386 --> 01:18:48.389
You're here to make yourself
feel better about what you did.

01:18:48.391 --> 01:18:50.024
Selma.

01:18:50.026 --> 01:18:51.392
Blah, blah, blah.

01:18:54.363 --> 01:18:57.465
Women ruin themselves
over a man or a job

01:18:57.467 --> 01:18:59.166
or their pathetic vanity.

01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:03.003
It's the same old boring
story, but we women,

01:19:03.005 --> 01:19:05.339
we keep telling it
over again every day,

01:19:05.975 --> 01:19:07.408
hurting each other.

01:19:09.512 --> 01:19:12.246
What are we doing here, Mary?

01:19:15.084 --> 01:19:16.417
Well, uhm...

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:18.319
Yeah.

01:19:23.159 --> 01:19:25.493
You just remember
something, Mary Locke.

01:19:25.495 --> 01:19:27.294
You're no better than me.

01:19:28.030 --> 01:19:29.530
We're both cheaters.

01:19:46.949 --> 01:19:48.115
Where is she?

01:19:48.117 --> 01:19:49.517
Where's Selma?

01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:54.955
I'm so sick of you and
your smug admin attitude.

01:19:54.957 --> 01:19:56.290
Who do you think you are?

01:19:56.526 --> 01:19:58.225
And what kind of a name is Dot?

01:19:58.227 --> 01:20:01.929
Your name is Dorothy, not Dot.

01:20:10.339 --> 01:20:11.872
You got that down?

01:20:15.244 --> 01:20:18.062
Pretty crazy, right?

01:20:18.063 --> 01:20:20.881
- This could be your next novel.
- Any idea where she is?

01:20:20.883 --> 01:20:23.217
No, she never came back after you
made that call from the diner.

01:20:23.219 --> 01:20:26.287
But listen to this, her
internet search history

01:20:26.289 --> 01:20:28.289
is for countries
with no extradition,

01:20:28.291 --> 01:20:32.092
and her password is
$tropical escape$.

01:20:32.094 --> 01:20:33.961
All lower case.

01:20:33.963 --> 01:20:36.163
And turns out she's
done this before.

01:20:36.999 --> 01:20:38.966
She used a different name,
obviously,

01:20:38.968 --> 01:20:41.068
but she used a dopey
teacher and a smart kid

01:20:41.070 --> 01:20:42.169
to help her get away with it.

01:20:42.171 --> 01:20:43.537
It's the exact same scheme.

01:20:43.539 --> 01:20:46.140
In 2003, she cleaned out a
teachers' retirement fund

01:20:46.142 --> 01:20:47.942
at a school in Northern Oregon

01:20:47.944 --> 01:20:49.276
where she was the
assistant principal.

01:20:49.278 --> 01:20:53.414
2008 in Rhode Island, 2010
in Jackson, Mississippi.

01:20:53.416 --> 01:20:56.617
All aliases, all dumb
accomplices who took the fall.

01:21:00.957 --> 01:21:02.523
There she is, there she is!

01:21:03.092 --> 01:21:04.525
That's her, that's her.

01:21:04.527 --> 01:21:06.427
- Carol!
- Danger!

01:21:06.429 --> 01:21:07.361
Danger!

01:21:07.363 --> 01:21:09.396
Danger, no.

01:21:09.398 --> 01:21:12.533
- Danger.
- Please do not run or do whatever that is!

01:21:12.535 --> 01:21:15.269
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:21:16.372 --> 01:21:17.605
- Okay.
- No, Carol.

01:21:17.607 --> 01:21:19.039
You all stick with them.

01:21:19.408 --> 01:21:22.142
Carol, Ms. Jensen.

01:21:23.145 --> 01:21:25.412
I'm gonna go get that kid
who doesn't like you.

01:21:26.482 --> 01:21:28.949
I'm gonna go stop that
crazy dancing lady.

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:33.921
Careful, careful, careful.
Careful, Jensen, careful.

01:21:33.923 --> 01:21:37.524
- Careful Carol, go!
- I am definitely getting my steps in today.

01:21:37.526 --> 01:21:38.926
Quit running, Carol!

01:21:38.928 --> 01:21:40.027
So fast.

01:21:47.403 --> 01:21:48.569
Thanks, Dot.

01:21:49.605 --> 01:21:52.106
Oh yeah? No, no, no!

01:21:52.108 --> 01:21:53.374
Selma was the brains!

01:21:53.376 --> 01:21:55.309
I was just a pawn
in the brain's game.

01:21:55.311 --> 01:21:58.512
Here.

01:21:58.514 --> 01:22:00.648
- <i>Attention teachers and students.</i>
- Wait.

01:22:00.650 --> 01:22:02.917
<i>Today is Ms. Carol
Jensen's birthday,</i>

01:22:02.919 --> 01:22:04.485
and we thought the whole school

01:22:04.487 --> 01:22:06.387
should give her
one collective hug.

01:22:06.389 --> 01:22:09.990
<i>And not in the abstract,
people, a real hug.</i>

01:22:10.326 --> 01:22:12.359
So if you see Ms. Jensen
in the halls,

01:22:12.361 --> 01:22:14.695
<i>please reach out and put
your arms around her.</i>

01:22:14.697 --> 01:22:16.997
<i>Just stop her and
hug her until you see</i>

01:22:16.999 --> 01:22:18.966
<i>Mr. Hume and two
police officers,</i>

01:22:18.968 --> 01:22:21.969
<i>and the wonderful
novelist Mary Locke.</i>

01:22:21.971 --> 01:22:24.638
- Oh, hey, Floyd!
- Oh hey, hey.

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:27.241
Oh no, get away from me, Floyd.
Get away from me!

01:22:27.243 --> 01:22:29.710
Oh, you're getting
a big hug from Floyd.

01:22:29.712 --> 01:22:32.546
No, no, no, no, he's wrong.
My birthday's in June.

01:22:32.548 --> 01:22:34.481
- I mean, I'm clearly a Gemini.
- Excuse me, excuse me.

01:22:34.483 --> 01:22:35.582
- That's the two-headed thing.
- Wow.

01:22:35.584 --> 01:22:37.384
I was putting it all back.

01:22:37.386 --> 01:22:41.088
Selma told me to take
the laptops and the wallets.

01:22:41.090 --> 01:22:46.060
Larry, I was
returning everything.

01:22:46.062 --> 01:22:47.628
Carol, why?

01:22:48.397 --> 01:22:49.730
Why would you do this?

01:22:49.732 --> 01:22:53.133
Because I'm moving
to New York, Larry.

01:22:53.135 --> 01:22:54.635
- What?
- Finally.

01:22:54.637 --> 01:22:58.238
I'm gonna be a dancer
and an actress.

01:22:59.141 --> 01:23:02.109
I mean actor, damn it!

01:23:02.111 --> 01:23:04.345
- No, please, Floyd get off me.
- Oh, it's okay.

01:23:04.347 --> 01:23:05.312
No, no!

01:23:05.314 --> 01:23:08.749
No, it's Broadway, Larry.

01:23:08.751 --> 01:23:10.751
If silver linings
are tinged with gold

01:23:10.753 --> 01:23:13.187
and gold linings are
tinged with stardust,

01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:15.089
you're very handsome
and powerful.

01:23:17.193 --> 01:23:20.094
- It's just a few questions.
- Yeah.

01:23:20.096 --> 01:23:21.595
- C.J. made me do this.
- All right.

01:23:21.597 --> 01:23:22.763
- C.J.!
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:23:22.765 --> 01:23:24.398
- No, he didn't.
- Yes he did.

01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:26.300
He just called Carol Jensen C.J.

01:23:28.204 --> 01:23:29.603
- I'm in love with her.
- Huh?

01:23:29.605 --> 01:23:31.271
I love that woman.

01:23:31.273 --> 01:23:33.040
Right, right, right.

01:23:33.042 --> 01:23:34.375
She smells like maple
syrup when she sweats.

01:23:34.377 --> 01:23:35.709
I know, they all do.

01:23:55.464 --> 01:23:56.397
Woo!

01:24:09.645 --> 01:24:12.479
Luke, Luke, it's all over!

01:24:12.481 --> 01:24:14.248
I know, Mom just told me.

01:24:14.817 --> 01:24:16.350
Dot called her from school.

01:24:16.352 --> 01:24:18.786
It's awesome, you get to stay!

01:24:19.588 --> 01:24:20.521
I wanna go.

01:24:23.559 --> 01:24:25.526
What, why?

01:24:25.828 --> 01:24:27.561
I want you to stay.

01:24:28.431 --> 01:24:31.598
- I worked so hard for this.
- Look, I know you did.

01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:34.768
We succeeded, we won.
I fixed everything.

01:24:34.770 --> 01:24:36.637
Emmett, Emmett, Emmett
look, listen to me.

01:24:36.639 --> 01:24:38.672
All right look, your
ability makes me

01:24:38.674 --> 01:24:41.575
wanna know what I'm
good at, and I've gotta

01:24:41.577 --> 01:24:44.144
be good at something
with a brother like you.

01:24:48.551 --> 01:24:52.486
Look man, let me show you
what I did, all right?

01:24:59.695 --> 01:25:02.663
You know, after I got
suspended from school,

01:25:02.665 --> 01:25:05.099
I started to think
about something bigger

01:25:05.101 --> 01:25:09.503
than just my sketches and
this is what I came up with.

01:25:12.208 --> 01:25:16.710
Emmett, the private school
in Maine, it's an art school.

01:25:18.581 --> 01:25:20.447
And it's the best art school
in the country.

01:25:20.449 --> 01:25:22.749
So, I'll get to do
this all the time.

01:25:25.488 --> 01:25:30.390
You're good at everything, but
I'm good at this one thing.

01:25:30.826 --> 01:25:32.693
I need to go and get better.

01:25:35.631 --> 01:25:37.631
Emmett, Emmett, come back!

01:25:47.843 --> 01:25:49.510
I don't get it.

01:25:50.713 --> 01:25:53.714
We figured out the truth so
everything should work out

01:25:53.716 --> 01:25:56.350
the way it's supposed to,
you know?

01:25:56.352 --> 01:25:58.552
So, why didn't it work out?

01:25:59.155 --> 01:26:03.657
Listen, you could do everything
right and still fail.

01:26:05.728 --> 01:26:07.494
Luke isn't going
to stay even though

01:26:07.496 --> 01:26:10.731
I did everything I
could to keep him here.

01:26:10.733 --> 01:26:12.366
Right.

01:26:12.368 --> 01:26:13.333
I failed.

01:26:14.336 --> 01:26:16.303
Is this what failure feels like?

01:26:16.739 --> 01:26:19.506
Sort of, but it can
be a lot worse.

01:26:21.177 --> 01:26:24.611
Uh-hu, we failed,
we failed miserably.

01:26:24.613 --> 01:26:28.248
I wouldn't
characterize it quite that way.

01:26:28.250 --> 01:26:29.183
Whoa!

01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:36.757
So, didn't your mom get
- into medical school? -Yeah.

01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:41.228
- Pretty brilliant.
- More than brilliant, she got a perfect score on the MCAT.

01:26:43.799 --> 01:26:47.434
- What?
- For a smart cookie, you're taking a really long time

01:26:47.436 --> 01:26:49.369
to figure this one out.

01:26:50.239 --> 01:26:51.605
Oh.

01:26:53.609 --> 01:26:54.641
It's my mom.

01:26:56.712 --> 01:26:58.912
I take after my mom.

01:27:00.783 --> 01:27:02.749
Everyone said
my dad was so smart,

01:27:02.751 --> 01:27:06.286
but my mom is total
genius material.

01:27:08.324 --> 01:27:10.624
She speaks six languages
and can solve

01:27:10.626 --> 01:27:12.893
a Rubik's Cube behind her back.

01:27:14.863 --> 01:27:15.796
Whoa.

01:27:17.633 --> 01:27:20.234
Oh boy, lot of
revelations today.

01:27:20.236 --> 01:27:22.669
It's a real biblical
sort of day, yeah.

01:27:22.671 --> 01:27:25.906
Oh man.

01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:30.644
So, you talk to Cal every day?

01:27:31.814 --> 01:27:34.915
I do, I ask him his advice.

01:27:35.718 --> 01:27:37.317
Tell him that I miss him.

01:27:38.687 --> 01:27:41.355
But I do feel that he's
here with me always.

01:27:41.357 --> 01:27:42.990
Could I be sitting
on Cal right now?

01:27:42.992 --> 01:27:45.726
Oh!

01:27:46.362 --> 01:27:48.862
Nah, he's over there.

01:27:57.940 --> 01:27:59.306
- High Five.
- Yeah.

01:27:59.308 --> 01:28:00.474
Yeah, guys.

01:28:00.476 --> 01:28:02.542
Look at this picture, though.

01:28:02.544 --> 01:28:04.478
Start her up, Mrs. Locke!

01:28:06.815 --> 01:28:08.548
Wait, it's the 15th.

01:28:08.550 --> 01:28:10.784
Hey Emmett, aren't the state
championships tomorrow?

01:28:10.786 --> 01:28:13.353
Yes, I'm not going to attend.

01:28:13.922 --> 01:28:15.922
I'm gonna let someone else win.

01:28:15.924 --> 01:28:18.392
I can just win it next year.

01:28:18.394 --> 01:28:19.726
I'm gonna fail tomorrow.

01:28:19.728 --> 01:28:22.429
Well, it's not really
failing if you forfeit.

01:28:22.431 --> 01:28:23.664
It is for me.

01:28:23.666 --> 01:28:24.765
Well look, don't get used

01:28:24.767 --> 01:28:26.033
to failing or
you'll turn into me.

01:28:26.035 --> 01:28:28.735
Ah, I should be so lucky.

01:28:32.775 --> 01:28:34.374
So connected to his emotions.

01:28:34.376 --> 01:28:35.642
Ah, stop.

01:28:35.644 --> 01:28:37.444
Emmett, what is this again?

01:28:37.446 --> 01:28:39.413
Oh, it's a double feature.

01:28:39.415 --> 01:28:41.348
It's <i>The Piano</i> followed
by <i>The Godfather.</i>

01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:43.917
What? That's gonna take
us like six hours.

01:28:43.919 --> 01:28:46.853
- Yeah, we have to be outta here by 10 p.m.
- I have to be home by 9.30.

01:28:46.855 --> 01:28:49.389
Come on, people.
I mean it's our first meeting.

01:28:49.391 --> 01:28:52.059
- Can't we just stay late one night?
- I'm staying for the double.

01:28:52.061 --> 01:28:54.594
All right, what do you say
that we just start here

01:28:54.596 --> 01:28:55.896
and see where we end up.

01:28:55.898 --> 01:28:57.397
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:28:57.399 --> 01:28:58.732
All right.

01:28:58.734 --> 01:29:00.600
Let's get
Weedee to taste test.

01:29:00.602 --> 01:29:01.735
Oh.

01:29:02.571 --> 01:29:03.503
Okay.

01:29:09.978 --> 01:29:10.911
Hi.

01:29:11.980 --> 01:29:13.413
Wow!

01:29:15.584 --> 01:29:17.017
Just wait for me.

01:29:32.401 --> 01:29:36.703
You gotta keep the staring to a minimum.
It's just getting super creepy.

01:29:36.705 --> 01:29:37.871
Yeah.
