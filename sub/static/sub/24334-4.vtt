communicate or connect.

It's, um...

10:03.036 --> 10:05.238

20:35.635 --> 20:39.372
* Just beginning.

20:39.406 --> 20:43.075
*

20:46.245 --> 20:47.947
GIRLS :
Lives with her mom

20:47.980 --> 20:50.783
'cause her dad's in hell.

20:50.817 --> 20:52.218
Poor lost elf.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.220
Keeps to herself.

20:54.253 --> 20:57.890
Lives with her mom
'cause her dad's in hell.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.892
Hey. Piss off!

21:04.864 --> 21:09.302
Hi, I'm... David.

21:09.336 --> 21:11.638
I'm a-I'm a teacher here.

21:11.671 --> 21:13.740
Were those girls bothering you?

21:13.773 --> 21:15.408
You're cheating.

21:15.442 --> 21:16.676
What?

21:16.709 --> 21:18.411
You can't just ask me.

21:18.445 --> 21:21.514
The whole point is you have
to figure it out yourself.

21:23.650 --> 21:25.585
Wait. What is happening?

21:25.618 --> 21:27.153
I thought we were in the maze.

21:27.186 --> 21:29.288
The monk...

21:31.958 --> 21:34.894
Again.

21:54.046 --> 21:56.383
Cary?

21:56.416 --> 21:59.386
Cary. Cary.

22:01.354 --> 22:03.956
CARY :
Oh.

22:03.990 --> 22:07.627
I'm stuck.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.829
I'm in here.

22:09.862 --> 22:12.365
-I-I'm... You got to pull.

22:12.399 --> 22:14.200
Pull, pull, pull, pull.

22:14.233 --> 22:17.504
-You pull.

22:19.372 --> 22:20.740
Oh, excuse me. Hi.

22:20.773 --> 22:24.377
Hi! Excuse me!

22:24.411 --> 22:27.414
We... Hello.
We j... We just woke up.

22:27.447 --> 22:29.048
Yeah.
You and everybody else.

22:29.081 --> 22:31.551
They, uh, found the monk
on the sidewalk, dead.

22:31.584 --> 22:33.853
And then all the missing
woke up-- 300 angry people

22:33.886 --> 22:35.388
who all need to use the bathroom
at the same time.

22:35.422 --> 22:37.223
It looks like he went off
the roof, the monk.

22:37.256 --> 22:38.858
Which could mean
that he caused the plague,

22:38.891 --> 22:40.660
infected people
wherever he went,

22:40.693 --> 22:42.094
-and now that he's gone, the...
-KERRY: Off the roof.

22:42.128 --> 22:43.830
How did he...

22:43.863 --> 22:45.197
That's unclear.
I got to, uh...

23:01.448 --> 23:03.015
I don't understand.

23:03.049 --> 23:04.884
Why haven't they woken up
like the others?

23:04.917 --> 23:07.053
No. No.

23:07.086 --> 23:08.455
What?

23:08.488 --> 23:10.256
Can't be right.

23:10.289 --> 23:12.925
Use words.

23:12.959 --> 23:14.894
They are awake.

23:14.927 --> 23:16.262
What?

23:16.295 --> 23:18.731
Their brain waves have changed.

23:18.765 --> 23:21.233
It's not the same pattern we got
with the others with the plague.

23:21.267 --> 23:24.637
As far as I can tell,
they're both awake.

23:24.671 --> 23:27.607
So why aren't their eyes open?

23:29.075 --> 23:31.343
I don't know.

24:10.316 --> 24:12.318
*

24:31.370 --> 24:33.372
*

24:44.817 --> 24:47.620
Okay.

24:47.654 --> 24:49.455
I get it.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.824
-Yes.

24:51.858 --> 24:53.459
It took me a while,
'cause I'm thick,

24:53.492 --> 24:55.327
but I finally figured it out,

24:55.361 --> 24:57.363
figured you out,
why you're doing this.

24:57.396 --> 24:59.999
-Yes, you.

25:00.032 --> 25:02.468
It's not a maze.
It's not the maze.

25:02.501 --> 25:05.371
I-I thought it was,
but this is you.

25:05.404 --> 25:08.875
You think that if you show me
who you are,

25:08.908 --> 25:11.243
who you really are--
all the mistakes,

25:11.277 --> 25:12.745
all the fouled up things
you did--

25:12.779 --> 25:15.014
that I won't love you anymore.

25:15.047 --> 25:17.049
It's a test.

25:17.083 --> 25:18.484
But you're forgetting who I am.

25:18.517 --> 25:21.888
David the-the lunatic,
the drug addict,

25:21.921 --> 25:23.489
who stole and cheated

25:23.522 --> 25:25.925
and ruined everything.

25:25.958 --> 25:29.095
And, yeah, you made some
bad choices, but you were young.

25:29.128 --> 25:31.397
And the world is an ugly place
for people like us--

25:31.430 --> 25:34.233
to people like us, so...

25:35.702 --> 25:38.337
I love you, okay?

25:38.370 --> 25:41.507
And there is nothing
you can show me

25:41.540 --> 25:45.444
that is gonna scare me away.

25:45.477 --> 25:47.580
So, ca...

25:49.649 --> 25:53.019
Can we go home now?

25:59.992 --> 26:03.062
Try again.

26:03.095 --> 26:05.131
Try.

26:09.769 --> 26:11.971
No.

26:12.004 --> 26:13.840
Really?

26:21.147 --> 26:24.050
*

26:41.333 --> 26:43.335
*

26:47.606 --> 26:50.810
I won't give up.

26:50.843 --> 26:53.345
I'll never give up.

27:01.688 --> 27:05.591
"Afterward, some are strong
at the broken places.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.593
"The word 'survivor'

27:07.626 --> 27:10.596
"used to mean
'one who has survived,'

27:10.629 --> 27:12.598
"but now modern psychiatry
would have us believe

27:12.631 --> 27:14.366
"that survival is a curse,

27:14.400 --> 27:18.104
"like Sisyphus with his rock.

27:18.137 --> 27:19.972
"And so every day

27:20.006 --> 27:24.677
we wake to survive again."

27:24.711 --> 27:25.978
-Come on, just a kiss.
-No.

27:26.012 --> 27:29.015
I've seen the way
you look at me.

27:29.048 --> 27:31.283
Stop.

27:31.317 --> 27:33.519
Frigid bitch.

27:35.154 --> 27:38.490
* I wanted her

27:38.524 --> 27:41.660
You want a kiss?

27:41.694 --> 27:45.064
* I wanted her

27:45.097 --> 27:48.500
* But she doesn't like

27:48.534 --> 27:50.136
* The life that I lead

27:50.169 --> 27:51.838
* She doesn't want

27:51.871 --> 27:53.305
* The life that I lead...

27:54.841 --> 27:56.809
I've already used up all my...

27:58.577 --> 28:00.579
I'm going out.

28:02.614 --> 28:04.751
-ISAAC: You're such a joy. Yeah.
-JOAN: No. Don't tell me that.

28:09.388 --> 28:11.690
Oh, my God...

28:15.294 --> 28:16.863
Hey.

28:18.464 --> 28:20.399
I'm going out.

28:24.804 --> 28:29.175
* I don't have a hope
in hell *

28:29.208 --> 28:32.078
* I'm happy just to

28:32.111 --> 28:34.781
* Watch her

28:34.814 --> 28:37.616
* Move.

28:39.986 --> 28:43.389

(record needle idling,
static amplified)

31:30.422 --> 31:32.424

32:49.568 --> 32:51.570

33:42.354 --> 33:46.592
ISAAC :
No!

33:48.760 --> 33:51.130
(Isaac speaks
indistinctly in the distance)

33:52.931 --> 33:57.603
ISAAC:
I... I...

33:57.636 --> 33:59.538
-Oh, my God.
-Look, look, I...

33:59.571 --> 34:01.273
I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything.

34:01.307 --> 34:03.575
-She's 15! She's 15!
-I... I didn't do it.

34:03.609 --> 34:05.077
-I didn't do anything!
-Oh, my God!

34:05.111 --> 34:06.712
I didn't...
I didn't do anything.

34:06.745 --> 34:09.381
-Oh, God.
-No! No!

34:09.415 --> 34:11.417
-I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything.
-No!

34:11.450 --> 34:13.185
-Oh! Oh!
-I did not. I swear to God.

34:13.219 --> 34:15.954
-I swear. I didn't do...
-Oh, no. Oh!

34:15.987 --> 34:18.524
-I didn't. Oh, my God.

34:18.557 --> 34:20.659
JOAN :
Oh!

34:57.095 --> 34:59.331
Okay.

35:04.303 --> 35:06.037
Okay.

35:08.307 --> 35:10.742
I think I understand.

35:10.776 --> 35:13.279
It's not about being alone,

35:13.312 --> 35:15.747
or about being in love.

35:15.781 --> 35:19.151
It's about the things
you survived.

35:19.185 --> 35:21.853
And as it's written,
"The world breaks everyone,

35:21.887 --> 35:24.990
"and afterward, some are strong

35:25.023 --> 35:28.260
at the broken places."

35:28.294 --> 35:30.429
-Go on.

35:30.462 --> 35:33.265
It's not the story
of a little girl

35:33.299 --> 35:35.934
whose mommy couldn't hug her...

35:35.967 --> 35:39.871
who grew up wishing a prince's
kiss could erase all her damage.

35:39.905 --> 35:41.673
It's about the damage itself,

35:41.707 --> 35:44.810
and how it makes us strong,
not weak.

35:44.843 --> 35:46.845
You survived the bullies

35:46.878 --> 35:49.014
and the way they made you feel.

35:49.047 --> 35:51.049
You cut yourself
with the dullest blade

35:51.082 --> 35:52.518
'cause it felt the worst--
I know that life,

35:52.551 --> 35:54.052
-'cause I lived it, too.
-I know.

35:54.085 --> 35:57.456
And then I met you,
and it was true love.

35:57.489 --> 36:00.192
Like in a fairy tale.

36:00.226 --> 36:02.294
This isn't a fairy tale.

36:03.529 --> 36:05.931
It is for me.

36:08.234 --> 36:11.102
Do you know what love is?

36:14.172 --> 36:16.675
It's a hot bath.

36:18.344 --> 36:21.012
What happens to things when you
leave them in a bath

36:21.046 --> 36:23.882
for too long?

36:23.915 --> 36:26.385
Huh?

36:28.053 --> 36:29.655
They get soft.

36:29.688 --> 36:32.023
Fall apart.

36:35.961 --> 36:39.097
I read that story collection.

36:39.130 --> 36:41.500
The one in your book.

36:41.533 --> 36:42.901
At first, I was confused,
you know--

36:42.934 --> 36:44.570
why is she carrying around
this sordid tale

36:44.603 --> 36:47.739
of sex clubs
and drug addicts and...

36:49.207 --> 36:51.443
And then I read this:

36:51.477 --> 36:54.846
"Junkies and masochists
and hookers,

36:54.880 --> 36:58.216
"and those who have
squandered everything

36:58.250 --> 37:01.453
are the ring of brightest angels
around heaven."

37:08.494 --> 37:12.130
It's a war, baby.

37:12.163 --> 37:15.267
This life.

37:15.301 --> 37:18.069
The things we endure.

37:19.405 --> 37:21.373
You said you saw the future,

37:21.407 --> 37:23.208
and it's an apocalypse.

37:23.241 --> 37:26.144
Who survives that--

37:26.177 --> 37:29.948
the lovers or the fighters?

37:32.117 --> 37:34.520
They sell us this lie that...

37:36.488 --> 37:40.158
...love's gonna save us.

37:40.191 --> 37:43.429
All it does
is make us stupid and weak.

37:46.097 --> 37:49.635
Thanks.
-Look at me.

37:49.668 --> 37:53.204
Love... isn't gonna save us.

37:55.774 --> 37:58.544
It's what we have to save.

38:00.346 --> 38:03.915
Pain makes us strong enough
to do it.

38:03.949 --> 38:05.584
All our scars,

38:05.617 --> 38:08.186
our anger, our despair--

38:08.219 --> 38:10.356
it's armor.

38:17.463 --> 38:21.266
Baby, God loves the sinners best

38:21.299 --> 38:25.036
'cause our fire burns bright,

38:25.070 --> 38:27.573
bright, bright.

38:31.042 --> 38:33.412
Burn with me.

38:54.265 --> 38:57.302
Okay...

38:57.335 --> 38:59.505
I'm ready.

39:48.286 --> 39:50.489
