00:12.564 --> 00:17.194
Right now, terrorists are plotting
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

00:18.337 --> 00:20.703
My wife and daughter have been targeted.

00:20.873 --> 00:24.206
And people that I work with
may be involved in both.

00:25.144 --> 00:27.169
I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer...

00:27.546 --> 00:30.879
...and today is the longest day of my life.

00:50.002 --> 00:51.026
Mom!

01:15.995 --> 01:16.962
Mom!

01:21.233 --> 01:22.200
Mom!

01:26.572 --> 01:28.870
Do you remember anything yet?

01:29.875 --> 01:30.842
No.

01:33.012 --> 01:34.604
Must be weird.

01:35.447 --> 01:39.213
I mean, I never met anyone that
has amnesia before.

01:42.188 --> 01:44.850
I really appreciate you helping me out.

01:53.465 --> 01:56.059
- What's your name?
- T anya.

01:57.069 --> 01:58.331
Tanya.

02:00.206 --> 02:02.834
I hope you're not going too far
out of your way.

02:02.942 --> 02:04.170
It's fine.

02:04.276 --> 02:06.642
The hospital isn't far from here.

02:09.414 --> 02:11.144
So, you come from money?

02:11.250 --> 02:13.946
You look like you might, or your husband.

02:15.154 --> 02:19.113
- My husband?
- A little band of gold? On your finger?

02:24.230 --> 02:26.596
I don't have any memory of my husband.

02:43.849 --> 02:47.649
Agent Pierce? Jack Bauer. We met
at the Senator's breakfast this morning.

02:47.753 --> 02:48.981
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

02:49.088 --> 02:50.919
We didn't know the pressure
you were under.

02:51.023 --> 02:53.355
- Is your family doing okay?
- Yes, they're fine.

02:53.459 --> 02:55.518
This is my partner, Nina Myers.

02:55.828 --> 02:59.286
Agents Johnson and Aleshire,
they're our surveillance technicians.

02:59.398 --> 03:02.697
You've already met Miss Nash,
she's part of the Senator's advance team.

03:02.801 --> 03:04.632
Yes, from the Senator's staff meeting.

03:04.837 --> 03:07.931
Can I just say how sorry I am
to have caused so much trouble?

03:08.173 --> 03:10.266
You didn't know
who Alexis Drazen really was.

03:10.376 --> 03:13.573
Knowing he's a killer, it takes courage
to walk into a room with him.

03:13.679 --> 03:15.647
I hate to interrupt, but we must get going.

03:15.748 --> 03:18.512
All right, Drazen is down here in room 1243.

03:18.717 --> 03:20.878
We went over it, there's nothing unusual.

03:20.986 --> 03:22.851
It's ready to rig however you want to.

03:22.955 --> 03:26.049
That gives us 30 minutes
to set up visual and audio.

03:26.158 --> 03:27.716
- Fiber optics?
- Yes.

03:27.826 --> 03:30.693
We also need to set up
monitors in an adjacent room.

03:30.796 --> 03:34.254
All right. 1242 across the hallway
has been vacated already.

03:34.433 --> 03:37.561
Okay, good. Gentlemen, I want you
to get started right away.

03:37.670 --> 03:40.605
I want coverage of every foot
of this room from two angles.

03:40.706 --> 03:42.037
- Yes, sir.
- Nina?

03:42.141 --> 03:43.199
Yeah.

03:44.543 --> 03:48.877
Take Miss Nash into 1242, start
prepping her, we'll be there in a minute.

03:48.981 --> 03:50.608
Have you set up the other checkpoints?

03:50.716 --> 03:52.946
Yes. Every entrance to the hotel is covered.

03:53.052 --> 03:55.714
So is every approach
from a block away on all four sides.

03:55.821 --> 03:57.311
Any civilians left on the floor?

03:57.423 --> 04:00.017
- No. We've sealed it off.
- Good work.

04:00.125 --> 04:02.787
You let me know
as soon as Drazen enters this hotel.

04:13.305 --> 04:15.603
There's a hospital
at the bottom of the canyon.

04:15.708 --> 04:17.801
I'm not sure how good it is.

04:19.178 --> 04:21.009
Wait, pull over.

04:21.579 --> 04:24.276
- You see something you remember?
- Yeah, I think so.

04:24.383 --> 04:26.476
- The restaurant?
- Yeah.

04:57.015 --> 04:59.006
Do you recognize anything?

04:59.485 --> 05:03.319
I've been here before, I was with someone.

05:04.423 --> 05:06.050
With your husband?

05:08.060 --> 05:09.652
Not your husband?

05:11.330 --> 05:13.855
Maybe we should just keep going
to the hospital.

05:13.966 --> 05:16.366
No, just being here helps.

05:18.203 --> 05:20.569
Hey, is there a maitre d' or manager?

05:20.839 --> 05:22.534
A manager, Mr. Martin.

05:22.775 --> 05:23.867
Is he here?

05:23.976 --> 05:26.444
No, but he should be in about 20 minutes.

05:26.545 --> 05:28.638
Thank you. I'm going to wait.

05:49.902 --> 05:52.928
Maybe this Mr. Martin
knows something about me.

05:55.674 --> 05:57.665
This place seems so familiar.

06:05.217 --> 06:07.048
I think I'm going to stay.

06:07.186 --> 06:08.744
You don't have to wait with me.

06:09.421 --> 06:12.117
Listen, why don't you give me
your number...

06:12.324 --> 06:15.555
...and when I'm better,
I'll send you whatever I can afford.

06:19.131 --> 06:20.564
You know what?

06:23.035 --> 06:26.903
Send me whatever you can afford, plus $10.

06:28.574 --> 06:31.008
It's cab fare to the hospital.

06:32.144 --> 06:34.271
In case Mr. Martin can't help you.

06:36.482 --> 06:39.246
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

06:54.967 --> 06:58.095
So, obviously,
without compromising yourself...

06:58.203 --> 07:01.400
...we need you to behave the same way
you always have with him.

07:03.208 --> 07:06.075
It's just the thought
of letting him touch me again.

07:06.411 --> 07:07.810
I understand.

07:08.413 --> 07:11.644
What do you usually talk about
with him? His work?

07:12.518 --> 07:16.318
The truth is we didn't talk
much. It wasn't that kind of relationship.

07:16.421 --> 07:20.448
It was more, "Take the plunge,
and worry about the consequences later."

07:20.559 --> 07:22.049
You know what I mean?

07:22.528 --> 07:23.495
Yeah.

07:24.296 --> 07:25.490
I'm waiting on a signal.

07:25.597 --> 07:26.894
Elizabeth.

07:28.133 --> 07:29.065
Hi.

07:29.268 --> 07:31.600
I heard what's going on.
Are you sure about this?

07:31.703 --> 07:32.761
I'm sure.

07:32.871 --> 07:36.034
- If you have the slightest hesitation...
- No, I want to.

07:36.308 --> 07:37.639
Definitely.

07:41.780 --> 07:43.372
May I talk to you a minute?

07:43.482 --> 07:44.779
Yes, sir.

07:49.855 --> 07:52.289
I told you to look after her,
not put her in danger.

07:52.391 --> 07:56.657
Senator, I don't need to remind you,
but the threat against you is very real.

07:56.828 --> 07:58.819
That's no reason
to put someone else at risk.

07:58.931 --> 08:00.193
I don't think I have.

08:00.299 --> 08:03.735
I'm going to be right across the hall
in case something goes wrong.

08:04.670 --> 08:07.366
He's a professional killer,
things can happen quickly.

08:07.472 --> 08:09.406
And we know Drazen is not working alone.

08:09.508 --> 08:12.477
Arresting him won't stop the others.
If you want to end this...

08:12.578 --> 08:14.637
...we keep him on the hook.

08:18.050 --> 08:19.483
I know you've been through a lot.

08:19.585 --> 08:21.644
I know they've put your family through hell.

08:21.753 --> 08:23.948
What does that have to do with this?

08:24.323 --> 08:28.419
I hope you're not letting a desire
for payback cloud your judgment.

08:30.529 --> 08:33.225
Sir, this has nothing to do with payback.

08:33.865 --> 08:36.799
This is simply the best way
to nail these guys, period.

08:41.273 --> 08:43.503
Elizabeth's father
is one of my oldest friends.

08:44.042 --> 08:46.533
I have known her since she was born.

08:47.079 --> 08:51.175
If anything happens to her,
I'm holding you personally responsible.

08:51.383 --> 08:55.683
I understand Senator, and I promise you,
I will take care of her.

10:06.124 --> 10:07.648
CTU. Almeida.

10:09.161 --> 10:11.595
Hi, I'd like to speak to Jack Bauer.

10:11.697 --> 10:13.289
He's not here. Can I take a message?

10:13.398 --> 10:16.629
Listen, it's really important.
I need to speak to him now.

10:17.335 --> 10:19.394
- Who is this?
- Kim, his daughter.

10:19.771 --> 10:21.864
- Are you calling from the safe house?
- No.

10:21.973 --> 10:23.565
The safe house has been attacked.

10:23.675 --> 10:27.975
The agents that were guarding us are dead,
and my mother is gone.

10:28.146 --> 10:30.842
Whoa, slow down. The agents are dead?

10:31.483 --> 10:34.816
Yes, and I think they've kidnapped
my mother again.

10:35.087 --> 10:37.021
I need to speak to my father.

10:37.122 --> 10:39.818
He's not here, Kim.
Where are you calling from?

10:41.293 --> 10:43.227
Can I speak to Nina Myers?

10:43.795 --> 10:46.355
She's not here either.
Where are you calling from?

10:46.465 --> 10:49.093
- A pay phone.
- Kim?

10:49.201 --> 10:52.898
- Who did you say this was again?
- It's Tony Almeida, I work for your father.

10:53.004 --> 10:55.939
Tell me where you are,
I'll have someone come get you.

11:00.011 --> 11:01.171
Klm?

11:02.614 --> 11:04.081
They said that to my mother.

11:04.182 --> 11:06.707
That was Jamey Farrell, she was dirty.
She's gone.

11:06.818 --> 11:08.149
That won't happen again.

11:08.253 --> 11:10.414
Tell me where you are,
I'll have someone get you.

11:10.522 --> 11:13.958
Listen to me, I need to speak
to my father or Nina Myers.

11:14.059 --> 11:15.219
He's not here, Kim.

11:15.327 --> 11:17.488
Neither one of them are here.

11:17.796 --> 11:19.593
Kim? Hello?

11:23.502 --> 11:26.300
We got a problem.
I just had a call from Jack's daughter.

11:26.404 --> 11:28.531
The safe house was hit
and the agents are dead.

11:28.640 --> 11:30.631
Call over there right now.

11:34.613 --> 11:36.342
Nothing, not even ringing.

11:36.915 --> 11:38.280
- Parker.
- Yeah.

11:38.383 --> 11:41.011
Get Biselli and go
to the safe house on Pine Canyon.

11:41.119 --> 11:43.952
- Be careful. Call me from there.
- I'm on it.

11:44.055 --> 11:46.853
She said she thought
her mother might have been recaptured.

11:46.958 --> 11:48.892
- How did the girl get out?
- She didn't say.

11:48.994 --> 11:51.588
She only told me
she was calling on a pay phone.

11:51.696 --> 11:55.154
Get a list of all the pay phone calls
that have been made...

11:55.267 --> 11:57.633
.. within a five-mile radius
of the safe house.

11:57.736 --> 12:00.671
- Are you going to call Jack?
- Not yet.

12:02.274 --> 12:05.038
- It's his wife and kid.
- That's exactly why.

12:05.143 --> 12:08.579
His emotions will distract him,
which puts Elizabeth Nash in jeopardy.

12:08.680 --> 12:11.945
She's meeting Drazen in 15 minutes.
We need to keep Jack focused.

12:12.050 --> 12:15.076
- All right, when do we tell him?
- We don't, I do.

12:15.187 --> 12:18.156
When the situation is under control
and not until. Clear?

12:20.959 --> 12:23.450
Elevator's In transit.
We're standing by. Copy?

12:23.562 --> 12:25.189
Copy. He's on his way down.

12:25.297 --> 12:27.026
- Are you finished yet?
- Ready in 10.

12:27.132 --> 12:28.497
How is Elizabeth doing?

12:28.667 --> 12:31.101
She says she's okay, but I don't know.

12:31.236 --> 12:33.033
Are you sure we're doing the right thing?

12:33.138 --> 12:35.834
If she plants the device,
it'll lead us to everything else.

12:35.941 --> 12:38.409
- Yes, we're doing the right thing.
- And if she can't?

12:38.510 --> 12:40.307
We'll arrest him and try to turn him.

12:40.412 --> 12:42.175
He can't touch her. We can protect her.

12:42.280 --> 12:45.613
- I hope so.
- Stay focused and we can.

12:45.717 --> 12:47.014
- Hey!
- What?

12:47.285 --> 12:48.843
Are you all right?

12:50.889 --> 12:52.288
I'm sorry.

12:58.463 --> 13:01.091
I can't stop worrying about Teri and Kim.

13:01.199 --> 13:03.565
When I think about what they've
been through...

13:03.668 --> 13:05.727
My little girl thought she was gonna die.

13:05.837 --> 13:08.397
Jack, we're going to get them, okay?

13:09.107 --> 13:13.237
If it's any help, from what I could tell,
Teri and Kim seemed all right.

13:13.845 --> 13:15.335
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:16.748 --> 13:19.876
- What did the doctor say?
- Just some bruises, that's it.

13:21.953 --> 13:24.114
- Okay, thanks.
- Okay?

13:24.222 --> 13:25.814
Yeah.

13:28.460 --> 13:30.087
- Nina?
- Yeah?

13:30.962 --> 13:33.487
You said that Paulson
was going to finish the debrief?

13:33.865 --> 13:36.425
- Yeah.
- Why didn't you stay and finish it?

13:37.002 --> 13:39.994
I thought you wanted me back
as soon as they were safe.

13:40.105 --> 13:43.233
No, I asked you to stay
with them so that they would...

13:43.341 --> 13:45.832
- Hey, Nina!
- Yeah, Mike. Just a minute.

13:47.112 --> 13:48.875
Go back. I will be there in a minute.

13:48.980 --> 13:50.345
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14:17.842 --> 14:20.310
I told you to take it off the hook!

14:27.485 --> 14:28.918
- Yeah.
- Rick, it's me.

14:29.020 --> 14:31.420
I told you, you can't keep calling here.

14:31.523 --> 14:34.959
Look, the safe house was bad.
The agents are dead...

14:35.060 --> 14:38.052
...and my mother is kidnapped again.
I know they're after me.

14:38.163 --> 14:39.721
You need to help me.

14:39.831 --> 14:42.095
- Listen, I'm coming to your place.
- No.

14:42.200 --> 14:46.102
You're the only person who knows
the people that have my mother.

14:46.204 --> 14:47.432
I don't.

14:47.539 --> 14:50.940
I can't go to the police,
I don't trust them.

14:51.076 --> 14:52.839
After today, I don't trust anyone.

14:52.944 --> 14:57.176
But if you don't help me right now,
I will tell the police everything.

14:59.484 --> 15:01.475
Now, what is your address?

15:06.558 --> 15:09.857
1804 Glade. It's in Echo Park.

15:09.961 --> 15:11.826
1804 Glade, in Echo Park.

15:12.297 --> 15:17.098
Okay, I'm going to call a taxi now. I'm
going to meet you there as soon as I can.

15:17.202 --> 15:18.635
Wait for me.

15:21.506 --> 15:22.564
Okay.

15:23.975 --> 15:25.408
Who was that?

15:30.448 --> 15:32.177
Another wrong number?

15:53.838 --> 15:55.806
How's the election going?

15:57.242 --> 16:00.405
- Exit polls look very good.
- That's great.

16:05.950 --> 16:09.317
- Dad, I'm sorry.
- Sorry about what?

16:12.690 --> 16:16.786
You weren't covering up Ferragamo's
death to protect your campaign.

16:18.496 --> 16:20.464
You did it to protect me.

16:22.734 --> 16:25.202
Where did you hear that, your mom?

16:26.337 --> 16:27.702
No, not Mom.

16:33.445 --> 16:37.244
There is some physical evidence,
In George Ferragamo's office...

16:37.348 --> 16:39.407
...that leads directly to you.

16:40.185 --> 16:43.586
Subtle enough so the fire marshals
didn't find it the first time around.

16:43.688 --> 16:46.384
But with a little help, they'll find it.

16:48.827 --> 16:50.886
So, I'll be framed for Ferragamo's murder.

16:50.995 --> 16:53.259
Llke I said, whatever it takes.

16:53.364 --> 16:57.494
That's why your father backed off,
and that's why you'll back off.

17:05.742 --> 17:10.305
Do you know how dangerous it was,
to go see Carl, wearing a wire?

17:10.882 --> 17:12.440
Look, it doesn't matter.

17:13.218 --> 17:15.378
I got it. Now you can take it to the police.

17:18.056 --> 17:19.647
Give me the tape.

17:22.160 --> 17:24.252
What are you going to do with it?

17:27.332 --> 17:29.197
Do you trust me, Keith?

17:57.862 --> 18:00.092
It's me. There's been a development.

18:00.198 --> 18:02.996
Palmer is staying in Los Angeles after all.

18:03.168 --> 18:04.999
The Nash girl called you?

18:05.103 --> 18:07.594
Yes. I'm on my way to the hotel now.

18:09.107 --> 18:11.701
Did she say
why the Senator changed his plans?

18:11.809 --> 18:13.674
No, he didn't tell her.

18:13.845 --> 18:16.814
Really? She's a highly placed aide.

18:16.981 --> 18:21.543
They've tightened security since
the attempt on his life at breakfast.

18:22.220 --> 18:24.711
I wonder that she wants
to see you again so quickly.

18:24.822 --> 18:26.483
You saw her a couple of hours ago.

18:26.591 --> 18:28.616
You don't understand women, Andre.

18:28.726 --> 18:33.288
I understand them well enough to know
they can use as well as be used.

18:34.299 --> 18:35.493
Not this one.

18:35.600 --> 18:38.364
Palmer should have been killed hours ago.

18:38.469 --> 18:41.404
We can't afford any more mistakes,
we're running out of time.

18:41.506 --> 18:43.406
He's as good as dead already.

18:43.608 --> 18:45.633
You have to trust me in this.

18:45.743 --> 18:48.007
The Nash woman will tell me
Palmer's schedule.

18:48.112 --> 18:49.704
She doesn't suspect a thing.

18:49.814 --> 18:51.111
Maybe not.

18:53.785 --> 18:57.312
Just to be safe,
when you're finished, kill her.

19:08.366 --> 19:10.425
Miss Nash, please follow me.

19:13.371 --> 19:15.669
We've planted fiber-optic cameras
in the room.

19:15.773 --> 19:18.503
Here, there, and all through here as well.

19:18.610 --> 19:21.078
I'm not really sure what those are.

19:21.446 --> 19:23.505
I'm sorry. Please sit down.

19:28.586 --> 19:30.554
Fiber-optic cameras are tiny cameras.

19:30.655 --> 19:33.624
They're almost impossible to see
even if you know where to look.

19:33.725 --> 19:35.454
So when you come into the room...

19:35.560 --> 19:38.358
...we will have complete visual coverage
of the entire suite.

19:38.463 --> 19:40.158
And you'll be able to hear everything?

19:40.265 --> 19:43.530
Yes, every word. You all right?

19:44.602 --> 19:47.002
Okay, now he's going to be here
In a few minutes.

19:47.872 --> 19:51.103
This is the tracking device that
we want you to plant on Alexis.

19:51.376 --> 19:55.369
Once he leaves the hotel, we'll be able
to track every move that he makes...

19:55.480 --> 19:57.209
...without exposing ourselves at all.

19:57.382 --> 19:58.644
Where do I put it?

19:58.750 --> 20:03.084
Preferably his wallet. He'll have it
at all tlmes, even if he changes clothes.

20:03.187 --> 20:06.645
As soon as you plant this device,
I will call you on your cell phone.

20:06.758 --> 20:09.318
I will tell you
the Senator is waiting for you.

20:09.560 --> 20:12.495
You make your excuses,
and you get out of here.

20:12.597 --> 20:15.088
So, I plant the tracker, the phone rings...

20:15.199 --> 20:18.100
- And then you leave.
- Okay.

20:18.202 --> 20:22.104
One more thing, if you start
to think he's getting suspicious...

20:22.206 --> 20:25.801
...or you're uncomfortable in any way,
all you have to do is say the words:

20:25.910 --> 20:27.502
"I hope I'm not getting a cold."

20:27.779 --> 20:30.179
- "I hope I'm not getting a cold."
- Yes.

20:30.548 --> 20:32.379
Then I'll be here in a few seconds...

20:32.483 --> 20:34.451
...with at least half a dozen other agents.

20:34.619 --> 20:36.280
But that would ruin the plan.

20:36.387 --> 20:37.479
That doesn't matter.

20:37.588 --> 20:41.388
Right now, all we're concerned with
is your safety. Do you understand?

20:42.927 --> 20:44.622
I understand.

20:49.467 --> 20:51.526
You don't have to do this.

20:52.570 --> 20:56.666
If you're uncomfortable in any way,
no one here will think any less of you.

20:56.841 --> 20:58.069
I'm fine.

20:59.677 --> 21:01.110
And, thank you...

21:02.380 --> 21:05.372
...for giving me this chance
to redeem myself.

21:14.058 --> 21:15.992
You're going to be fine.

21:17.462 --> 21:18.690
Let's go.

21:22.367 --> 21:26.269
Mrs. Bauer? How good to see you.

21:28.673 --> 21:29.970
You know me?

21:30.074 --> 21:32.872
Of course. Will Dr. Parslow be joining you?

21:33.311 --> 21:34.676
Dr. Parslow?

21:36.114 --> 21:38.207
I'm sorry, what's your name?

21:38.716 --> 21:41.207
Mrs. Bauer, are you feeling all right?

21:41.452 --> 21:43.443
Actually, no.

21:44.555 --> 21:48.651
I must have been
in an accident or something.

21:49.961 --> 21:52.122
I seem to have lost my memory.

21:52.630 --> 21:55.963
But I was driving by
and this place looked familiar, so...

21:57.235 --> 21:59.863
- You say my name is Bauer?
- Yes.

22:00.972 --> 22:02.769
Does that sound familiar?

22:04.542 --> 22:08.273
Yes, it does,
but this man you mentioned...

22:08.746 --> 22:10.111
Dr. Parslow.

22:11.549 --> 22:14.484
You two used to come here together
quite often.

22:17.321 --> 22:19.152
But he's not my husband?

22:19.757 --> 22:20.746
Well...

22:21.426 --> 22:25.089
He's a doctor, and he's a friend,
maybe he can hell.

22:26.097 --> 22:29.828
I happen to know the hospital
that he works at. Shall I give him a call?

22:31.269 --> 22:32.634
Yes, please.

22:41.312 --> 22:42.609
We're set.

22:50.555 --> 22:52.921
- Is everything up and running?
- Yep.

22:55.960 --> 22:59.589
- How's Elizabeth?
- She's in her room, waiting for Alexis' call.

22:59.697 --> 23:01.460
She said she wanted to be alone.

23:01.566 --> 23:03.261
- Understandable.
- Yes.

23:24.455 --> 23:26.923
You want to tell me what's going on?

23:27.458 --> 23:28.948
What do you mean?

23:29.060 --> 23:30.857
You've been holding something back...

23:30.962 --> 23:33.623
...since you got back from
the safe house early.

23:33.731 --> 23:36.165
This isn't the time.
Let's not get distracted.

23:36.267 --> 23:39.498
If you don't tell me,
I'll be distracted. So spit it out.

23:44.008 --> 23:45.202
All right.

23:46.644 --> 23:48.373
Teri knows about us.

23:51.749 --> 23:54.775
She guessed it.
I don't know how she did, but she did.

23:55.419 --> 23:58.855
She asked me point-blank.
I couldn't deny it, she would have known.

24:03.461 --> 24:05.929
Did you tell her that it was over?

24:06.631 --> 24:08.189
Of course I did.

24:11.836 --> 24:14.862
I think she was just shocked
that it was me...

24:16.774 --> 24:18.503
...someone she knows.

24:31.022 --> 24:33.422
When Teri and I got back together...

24:36.360 --> 24:38.555
...I tried to talk to her about this, but...

24:40.331 --> 24:44.028
...she said she didn't want to know,
so I just let it go.

24:44.902 --> 24:47.769
Look, you asked me
to go to the safe house, so I did.

24:47.872 --> 24:50.306
- I was just trying to help.
- I know.

24:50.441 --> 24:53.410
This is my fault. This is all my fault.

24:54.412 --> 24:56.346
Agent Bauer, come in.

24:58.916 --> 25:00.474
- Bauer.
- We're a go.

25:00.585 --> 25:02.712
Drazen dropped off the car
with the valet.

25:02.820 --> 25:05.084
Should be upstairs
In about two and a half minutes.

25:05.189 --> 25:08.181
Copy. All personnel in the lobby
and on the floors...

25:08.292 --> 25:10.123
...we are a go.

25:29.180 --> 25:30.772
He's in the room.

25:30.982 --> 25:33.644
Copy. Advise when you are green to go.

25:40.758 --> 25:42.191
There's no wallet here.

25:42.393 --> 25:45.885
Let Elizabeth Nash know
that the wallet is either in his pants...

25:45.997 --> 25:47.726
...or the jacket on the bed.

25:48.065 --> 25:49.692
Copy that.

25:59.543 --> 26:02.205
Give me a sitrep in one minute.

27:01.238 --> 27:02.227
Hi.

27:13.217 --> 27:15.048
It's so good to see you.

27:24.628 --> 27:27.222
I can't believe how much I've missed you.

27:27.531 --> 27:28.862
Oh, me too.

27:30.468 --> 27:35.872
- Even though it's only been two hours.
- It seems like two years.

27:41.812 --> 27:43.643
Are you okay?

27:44.815 --> 27:46.373
I'm fine. Why?

27:46.550 --> 27:48.211
You seem a little tense.

27:48.652 --> 27:50.244
No, not at all.

27:53.124 --> 27:54.591
Maybe a little.

27:55.059 --> 27:57.789
The polls back East
close in less than an hour.

27:57.895 --> 28:00.363
We're all just on pins and needles.

28:05.102 --> 28:07.627
You must have some idea
about the outcome.

28:07.738 --> 28:09.933
- Don't you, take...
- Exit polls.

28:10.040 --> 28:12.907
- Yes.
- But they're not official.

28:16.046 --> 28:17.980
What can we do...

28:18.082 --> 28:19.845
...to help you...

28:21.986 --> 28:23.283
...relax?

28:25.556 --> 28:29.549
It's a little early,
but a vodka might be nice.

28:32.029 --> 28:34.088
Nothing else?

28:35.232 --> 28:36.893
If you insist.

29:05.763 --> 29:08.960
- You feeling any better?
- Much.

29:11.836 --> 29:14.304
You still don't seem like yourself.

29:15.105 --> 29:18.541
I'll feel better,
after I splash some water on my face.

29:25.115 --> 29:26.844
She's going for the jacket.

29:26.951 --> 29:30.648
I want SWAT personnel
ready at the door, quietly.

29:33.724 --> 29:35.487
She's got the wallet.

29:40.231 --> 29:42.096
God, Jack, she's dropped it.

29:49.673 --> 29:50.765
Come on.

29:50.875 --> 29:54.242
Come on, Elizabeth, you can do it.

29:59.917 --> 30:03.045
- To the future.
- She's put it in her coat.

30:03.153 --> 30:06.816
SWAT team at the door, stand down.
Stand down at the door.

30:18.068 --> 30:21.469
Sorry that this campaign
is giving you so much stress.

30:24.341 --> 30:26.275
Goes with the territory.

30:27.111 --> 30:32.106
Maybe when the election is over,
the two of us can go somewhere together.

30:34.919 --> 30:37.683
- Like where?
- Doesn't matter to me.

30:40.391 --> 30:42.359
As long as we're together.

30:45.029 --> 30:49.728
So, who do I have to thank
for keeping you in town?

30:50.067 --> 30:51.796
He's going to feel the wallet.

30:51.902 --> 30:54.996
Give her a second, she's all right.

30:56.807 --> 30:59.901
What made the Senator
decide to change his plans?

31:00.010 --> 31:01.443
I don't know.

31:03.881 --> 31:06.441
Is he going to stay in town for long?

31:06.784 --> 31:08.376
It's hard to say.

31:10.354 --> 31:13.915
What about his victory speech?

31:14.658 --> 31:16.956
Will he be delivering it here at the hotel?

31:17.628 --> 31:21.223
Why are you so interested
in the campaign all of a sudden?

31:21.699 --> 31:24.395
I have no interest in the campaign.

31:26.236 --> 31:28.397
My interest is in you...

31:29.673 --> 31:31.903
...and I know
that you go wherever he goes.

31:32.977 --> 31:35.104
I don't know where that is yet.

31:36.213 --> 31:39.080
Well then, I won't let you out of my sight.

31:40.617 --> 31:44.212
I must say I do find it a little strange
that the Senator wouldn't...

31:44.321 --> 31:48.087
...include someone as smart and capable
as you in his...

31:48.359 --> 31:49.690
...inner clrcle.

31:50.094 --> 31:51.789
How would you know how smart I am?

31:51.895 --> 31:56.059
We've spent, what, 15 hours together?
And most of that has been in bed.

31:56.166 --> 31:57.793
That wasn't smart.

32:00.137 --> 32:04.540
Was that a complaint or a compliment?

32:09.446 --> 32:11.437
Both, I think.

32:16.487 --> 32:19.923
I just realized that
I haven't eaten all day.

32:21.458 --> 32:24.552
Which may explain
why I'm in such a foul mood.

32:27.364 --> 32:29.229
You think you could order something up?

32:30.467 --> 32:34.130
- What are you hungry for?
- Where's the menu?

32:40.411 --> 32:43.346
I was hoping you would be hungry
for something...

32:43.580 --> 32:46.378
- ... other than food.
- There you go. Good girl.

32:56.794 --> 32:58.261
It's in the jacket.

32:58.362 --> 33:01.559
She made the plant, clear the hallway.

33:01.665 --> 33:03.599
Copy. Clear the hallway.

33:11.775 --> 33:15.211
I know this might seem a little soon.

33:23.353 --> 33:25.378
I've fallen in love with you.

33:30.928 --> 33:32.156
The hallway's clear.

33:32.262 --> 33:34.253
Copy. I'm making the call.

33:42.072 --> 33:44.870
I thought all women can sense these things.

33:54.084 --> 33:55.676
Pick up the phone.

33:57.821 --> 33:59.880
Aren't you going to answer it?

34:00.290 --> 34:03.350
- It's just someone from the campaign.
- No, it could be important.

34:03.460 --> 34:05.155
They can call back.

34:16.139 --> 34:17.902
Say it again, Alexis.

34:18.976 --> 34:20.204
She hung up on me.

34:20.310 --> 34:21.708
Say that you love me.

34:21.812 --> 34:24.371
- What is she doing?
- She's baiting him.

34:24.748 --> 34:26.079
I love you.

34:28.619 --> 34:30.813
If I'm not very much mistaken...

34:31.722 --> 34:34.657
...It seems that you
are falling in love with me, too.

34:39.897 --> 34:41.694
I got her voice mail.

34:41.797 --> 34:44.062
Would you order me a hamburger?

34:46.303 --> 34:47.600
Of course.

34:51.408 --> 34:53.808
- What is she doing?
- I don't know.

34:55.045 --> 34:57.206
Why did she take off her jacket?

35:04.821 --> 35:06.584
What is going on, here?

35:06.823 --> 35:09.587
She has no intention of leaving that room.

35:11.228 --> 35:12.695
Room Servlce, how may I help you?

35:12.796 --> 35:15.526
Hello, a hamburger please.

35:15.666 --> 35:18.965
- All rlght, everything on that?
- Yes everything.

35:19.436 --> 35:21.404
- We'll send it right up.
- Okay.

35:25.175 --> 35:26.904
What's that in her hand?

35:28.612 --> 35:30.170
So now...

35:31.381 --> 35:33.440
...is there anything else?

35:34.651 --> 35:35.618
Yes.

35:35.953 --> 35:37.545
Oh, my God, she's got a knife.

35:37.654 --> 35:40.714
SWAT team, hit the room!
Hit the room, now!

35:42.326 --> 35:44.021
You son of a bitch!

35:51.935 --> 35:54.995
Hold your fire!
Get me some towels from the bathroom.

35:57.674 --> 36:00.643
Nina, call in a medevac. We're losing him.

36:00.744 --> 36:02.507
We cannot let him die.

36:03.313 --> 36:04.280
Damn it!

36:32.776 --> 36:34.903
- Just a minute.
- Yeah, sure.

37:09.713 --> 37:11.681
I'm looking for Rick.

37:12.783 --> 37:15.217
- Who are you?
- A friend.

37:17.421 --> 37:19.548
Are you the one who keeps calling?

37:19.656 --> 37:22.887
- He said I could come over.
- Not to me, he didn't.

37:25.429 --> 37:29.092
- Maybe you should ask him, then.
- I was about to tell you.

37:29.232 --> 37:31.792
I just didn't think she'd get here so fast.

37:32.002 --> 37:33.833
What's going on, Rick?

37:34.004 --> 37:35.938
I'll explain everything.

37:36.273 --> 37:39.367
- I'm listening.
- First let her come in.

37:41.378 --> 37:42.970
It's okay, baby.

37:46.283 --> 37:47.978
What does she want?

37:48.652 --> 37:51.086
Something got screwed up
with Dan last night.

37:51.188 --> 37:54.385
Big surprise, right?
That's why my arm is messed up.

37:54.491 --> 37:56.721
These guys Dan was with, they shot me...

37:56.827 --> 37:59.125
You said you cut your arm on a fence.

38:03.166 --> 38:07.728
These people Dan knows,
I need to find them.

38:08.438 --> 38:10.565
And I was hoping
that I could go in his room...

38:10.874 --> 38:12.842
...and find something, to lead me to them.

38:12.943 --> 38:15.002
A phone number, an address...

38:15.112 --> 38:17.080
So you just want
to look through Dan's room?

38:17.180 --> 38:18.306
Yeah.

38:22.953 --> 38:25.888
I was wondering if I could borrow
some money for the cab.

39:00.757 --> 39:02.190
Teri.

39:03.593 --> 39:04.719
You all right?

39:10.667 --> 39:12.692
You don't remember me?

39:19.409 --> 39:20.398
Phil.

39:23.180 --> 39:27.014
- Are you my doctor?
- No, not exactly.

39:28.018 --> 39:31.317
Henry, thank you for calling me.
Have you given her anything to eat?

39:31.421 --> 39:34.117
I offered, but she didn't want anything.

39:37.494 --> 39:38.893
No, it's...

39:40.730 --> 39:42.561
Unless you want some water?

39:43.300 --> 39:45.131
- Sure.
- Okay, some water.

39:47.404 --> 39:51.306
All right, we're going to
figure out what this is all about.

39:51.408 --> 39:54.172
We're going to get you well again,
you understand?

39:54.544 --> 39:57.877
It's going to be fine.
Everything's going to be fine.

40:03.386 --> 40:06.287
I don't know what to say.
We misjudged her emotional state.

40:06.389 --> 40:07.913
No, we didn't. You did.

40:08.024 --> 40:10.151
It was an unexpected
outcome for everyone.

40:10.260 --> 40:13.559
- It's what I said it would be, a bad idea.
- Fine, maybe.

40:13.663 --> 40:15.961
Right now we need
to figure out our next move.

40:16.066 --> 40:19.832
- What's the status on Alexis?
- They're giving him a 50-50 shot.

40:19.936 --> 40:22.871
But even if he lives,
they don't know how long until he talks.

40:22.973 --> 40:25.874
Did you find anything in his room?
Phone numbers, documents?

40:25.976 --> 40:27.534
No, nothing yet.

40:27.644 --> 40:29.077
What am I supposed to tell District?

40:29.179 --> 40:31.409
Anything.
Just keep them off my back.

40:31.515 --> 40:33.540
I need some time before the field reports.

40:33.650 --> 40:35.015
- Let me in.
- Hold on.

40:35.118 --> 40:36.085
Where's Elizabeth?

40:36.186 --> 40:37.983
- I heard about a stabbing.
- She's fine.

40:38.088 --> 40:41.216
- Where is she?
- She's across the hall, she's in custody.

40:41.324 --> 40:43.622
- What! Why?
- She stabbed Drazen.

40:43.727 --> 40:45.194
It must have been in defense.

40:45.295 --> 40:47.195
No, sir, that's not how it went down.

40:47.297 --> 40:49.561
She broke from the plan, she attacked him.

40:49.666 --> 40:51.930
You should have never let her
go through with it.

40:52.035 --> 40:53.263
I got to call you back.

40:53.370 --> 40:54.701
What's going on over there?

40:54.804 --> 40:55.668
Senator.

40:55.772 --> 40:58.332
- Let me in.
- Certainly.

40:58.441 --> 40:59.738
Senator.

40:59.843 --> 41:02.038
Don't say anything
until you speak to a lawyer.

41:02.145 --> 41:04.545
I'm sorry, I don't know what happened.

41:04.648 --> 41:06.707
It's all right, we're gonna work this out.

41:06.816 --> 41:08.977
Please, step away, let us handle this.

41:09.085 --> 41:11.679
I let you take care of it before,
and look where we are.

41:11.788 --> 41:13.722
Sir, you are not helping matters right now.

41:13.823 --> 41:14.790
Jack!

41:15.659 --> 41:18.560
Excuse me for one second. What?

41:18.795 --> 41:21.423
It's Alexis' phone. What do we do?

41:31.675 --> 41:33.609
We got to take a chance.

41:35.378 --> 41:36.140
Yeah?

41:36.246 --> 41:39.215
- You have the money?
- Yeah.

41:39.616 --> 41:41.584
Okay. We'll meet in 45 minutes.

41:42.218 --> 41:43.981
- Where?
- I already told you.

41:46.056 --> 41:48.047
At Connie's, downtown.

41:49.759 --> 41:51.249
How will I recognize you?

41:51.361 --> 41:53.522
I'll wear a red baseball cap.

41:54.305 --> 42:00.483
