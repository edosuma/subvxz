00:07.089 --> 00:10.070
(male narrator)
Long, long ago,
deep in the forest

00:10.089 --> 00:14.060
there was a hidden village
where tiny creatures lived.

00:14.080 --> 00:17.000
They called themselves Smurfs.

00:17.019 --> 00:19.070
They were good.

00:19.089 --> 00:21.219
[theme music]

00:24.120 --> 00:28.129
Then there was Gargamel,
the evil wizard.

00:28.149 --> 00:29.219
He was bad.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.130
Oh, I hate Smurfs!

00:33.159 --> 00:34.219
I'll get you

00:35.000 --> 00:36.020
I'll get all of you

00:36.039 --> 00:38.140
if it's the last thing
I ever do!

00:38.159 --> 00:40.119
[evil laughter]

00:40.140 --> 00:41.130
Oh!

00:41.149 --> 00:43.109
Oh, I'll get you!

00:43.130 --> 00:46.179
'I'll find your village someday.
You'll be sorry.'

00:46.200 --> 00:49.030
(male narrator)
Well, the forest
is still there.

00:49.049 --> 00:53.030
And if you listen,
you may hear Gargamel's rage.

00:53.049 --> 00:55.130
And if you're good
you may just

00:55.149 --> 00:59.079
catch a glimpse
...of the Smurfs.

01:01.170 --> 01:04.049
[theme music]

01:07.060 --> 01:09.030
[instrumental music]

01:17.090 --> 01:20.039
And now,
for the final ingredient.

01:20.060 --> 01:22.150
A tad of bat breath.

01:22.170 --> 01:24.000
plop

01:24.019 --> 01:26.129

01:28.030 --> 01:29.159
glug glug

01:29.180 --> 01:33.170
It's done, Azrael!
My magical mirror is ready!

01:33.189 --> 01:37.020
'When I put this in the forest
no Smurfs can resist'

01:37.039 --> 01:38.189
'looking at their reflection.'

01:38.210 --> 01:40.219
And when they do..

01:41.000 --> 01:42.039
meow

01:42.060 --> 01:44.210
...they will become
my prisoners.

01:44.229 --> 01:46.200
[yowls]

01:46.219 --> 01:49.049
meow

01:49.069 --> 01:50.129
[yowls]

01:52.079 --> 01:53.159
It works!

01:53.180 --> 01:57.009
Soon all
the Smurfs will be mine.

01:58.020 --> 02:00.189
Azrael, you stupid, nicompuss.

02:00.209 --> 02:02.120
You shouldn't have looked.

02:02.140 --> 02:04.189
That's for Smurfs to do.

02:04.209 --> 02:06.129
[evil cackle]

02:06.150 --> 02:09.030
And now, to the forest.

02:12.069 --> 02:14.169
[instrumental music]

02:17.110 --> 02:20.050
And remember, it's not
winning that counts.

02:20.069 --> 02:22.039
It's how you play the game.

02:24.150 --> 02:26.210
[blows whistle]

02:26.229 --> 02:28.050
- Hey!
- Over here!

02:28.069 --> 02:30.000
- 'Hand it to me.'
- 'Come on, come on.'

02:30.020 --> 02:32.229
[clamoring]

02:34.120 --> 02:35.150
plop

02:35.170 --> 02:37.050
Hey!

02:37.069 --> 02:40.090
Oh, what a goalie you are.

02:40.110 --> 02:41.180
boing

02:41.199 --> 02:44.120
- I got it!
- 'Hey, it's mine!'

02:44.139 --> 02:47.099
- 'Get out of my way!'
- 'It's mine! I've got it!'

02:47.120 --> 02:49.110
Careful, my mirror.

02:50.180 --> 02:52.039

02:52.060 --> 02:53.180

02:58.009 --> 03:00.120
Here's a present

boing

03:07.159 --> 03:09.159
boom

03:11.199 --> 03:13.189
(Hefty)
'Smurf it, Vanity.'

03:13.210 --> 03:17.000
- My mirror.
- You didn't smurf it, Vanity.

03:17.020 --> 03:18.219
And now, Clumsy's team won.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.030
Who cares?
I'm not playing anymore.

03:22.050 --> 03:24.170
Oh, go smurf a tree, Vanity.

03:25.219 --> 03:27.210
[mellow music]

03:34.060 --> 03:36.189

03:40.060 --> 03:42.050
(Gargamel)
'Perfect! Perfect!'

03:42.069 --> 03:44.199
This spell is so
disgustingly pretty

03:44.219 --> 03:47.159
those insidious Smurfs
are bound to show up.

03:47.180 --> 03:51.150
Now, Azrael, we will enter
my magical mirror and wait.

03:51.170 --> 03:53.199
[meowing]

03:53.219 --> 03:54.229
Gotcha!

03:56.000 --> 03:57.090
[chimes]

03:58.120 --> 04:00.110
Break my mirror, will they?

04:00.129 --> 04:03.129
Well, we'll see about that.
Hmph!

04:03.150 --> 04:05.180
What a mirror!

04:07.030 --> 04:11.020
Just the thing
for a mis-under-smurf, smurf.

04:11.039 --> 04:12.080
Ah.

04:12.099 --> 04:15.050
A Smurf is taking the bait.

04:15.069 --> 04:17.180
Hmm, looks pretty smurfy to me.

04:19.019 --> 04:21.000
whoosh

04:24.149 --> 04:26.230
[dramatic music]

04:31.009 --> 04:33.159
What-what, what is this place?

04:33.180 --> 04:36.000
(Gargamel)
'You're in my magic mirror.'

04:36.019 --> 04:39.000
'You rotten, miserable,
little smurf.'

04:42.060 --> 04:43.090
Uh-oh.

04:44.159 --> 04:46.180

Gargamel!

boing

04:54.060 --> 04:56.170
Whoa, smurfess me!

04:58.009 --> 05:01.009
Oh, let me go,
you dumb wizard.

05:01.029 --> 05:04.060
Ugh! Ah! Ah! Yah!

05:04.079 --> 05:05.170
Well, well, well.

05:05.189 --> 05:07.079
My first smurf.

05:07.100 --> 05:09.000

slurp

05:13.000 --> 05:14.170
No! Not yet, Azreal.

05:14.189 --> 05:18.040
First we must catch more of
these revolting little Smurfs.

05:18.060 --> 05:19.180
meow

05:19.199 --> 05:21.009
They are very loyal.

05:21.029 --> 05:23.089
And when they come
looking for this one

05:23.110 --> 05:26.180
then we shall dine
on Smurf stew.

05:26.199 --> 05:28.160
[laughs]

05:28.180 --> 05:29.180
[yowls]

05:29.199 --> 05:31.019
slurp

05:32.149 --> 05:35.069
Yes, fixer spells.
Fixer spells.

05:35.090 --> 05:37.079
Oh, yes. Here we are.

05:37.100 --> 05:39.060
Uh.. "For best results

05:39.079 --> 05:42.220
all fixer spell should
be cast in absolute quiet."

05:43.000 --> 05:45.139
Oh, well. There is always
plenty of quiet around.

05:45.159 --> 05:47.209
(Smurfette)
'Papa Smurf! Papa Smurf!'

05:47.230 --> 05:48.220
[knock on door]

05:49.000 --> 05:50.100
What is it?

05:50.120 --> 05:53.129
Smurfette,
how many times, must I say

05:53.149 --> 05:56.019
no Smurfs allowed
when I am working.

05:56.040 --> 05:58.029
But it's Vanity, Papa smurf.

05:58.050 --> 06:00.139
He went into the forest,
yesterday afternoon.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.060
And he's been gone all night.

06:02.079 --> 06:04.040
Hmm, indeed.

06:04.060 --> 06:06.189
Then we must form
a search party.

06:09.009 --> 06:11.139
[blows trumpet]

06:14.230 --> 06:16.060
[blows]

Surprise!

06:19.000 --> 06:20.180

06:22.050 --> 06:25.029
I've a decree from Papa Smurf.

06:25.050 --> 06:26.230
[indistinct chatter]

06:27.009 --> 06:29.110
I hate decrees.

06:29.129 --> 06:31.019
"Hear ye, hear ye.

06:31.040 --> 06:33.159
"All Smurfs please
report to Papa's house

06:33.180 --> 06:35.069
for an emergency meeting."

06:36.139 --> 06:38.009
So listen, you Smurfs.

06:38.029 --> 06:42.110
Vanity has been gone all night.
And he may be in big trouble.

06:42.129 --> 06:44.129
[indistinct chatter]

06:45.129 --> 06:47.230
Now, I want Smurfette, Brainy

06:48.009 --> 06:49.110
and, uh, Clumsy

06:49.129 --> 06:52.100
to fly out on Feathers
for a sky search.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.129
The rest of you Smurfs
come with me.

06:54.149 --> 06:57.209
'We'll smurf every inch
of this forest if we have to.'

06:58.000 --> 07:00.189
All for smurf
and smurf for all.

07:00.209 --> 07:04.060

All for smurf

07:30.000 --> 07:32.040
- Yuck!
- Who asked you?

07:32.060 --> 07:34.029
Just keep stirring.

07:35.220 --> 07:39.040
Does it smell good,
my little stew tid-bit?

07:39.060 --> 07:43.009
Well, we'll make it even better
when we add the main ingredient.

07:43.029 --> 07:45.029
Freshly caught Smurf.

07:46.159 --> 07:48.209

Oh, oh, oh.
Oh! Whoa!

07:51.079 --> 07:53.029

07:53.050 --> 07:56.040
Don't you threaten me,
you miserable little half pint.

07:56.060 --> 07:59.060
We better return to
the village, it'll be dark soon.

07:59.079 --> 08:02.189
- Papa Smurf, always says--
- We have to find Vanity.

08:02.209 --> 08:05.019
And we're not going
back until we do.

08:05.040 --> 08:06.139
Yup, that's right.

08:06.160 --> 08:09.009
- Yup!
- Papa Smurf, always says--

08:09.029 --> 08:11.110
Look, there
is something down there.

08:11.129 --> 08:13.220
(Clumsy)
'Yup! I see it! I see it!'

08:15.170 --> 08:17.220
Gee, that's a mirror.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.050
Where did that come from?
Huh? Huh?

08:20.069 --> 08:23.220
I don't know.
But Vanity's been here. Look!

08:24.000 --> 08:26.230
Wait, Clumsy.
Haste makes waste.

08:29.050 --> 08:30.029
plop

08:30.050 --> 08:31.069
Where did he go?

08:31.089 --> 08:33.100
Oh, Clumsy.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.179
I bet that mirror
got Vanity too.

08:38.200 --> 08:41.049
Then we have
rescue them, Brainy.

08:41.070 --> 08:42.230
Abso-smurfly not.

It might get me.'

Come on, Clumsy,
we gotta find Vanity.

They're getting away.

we'll have
our Smurf stew after all.

They're gone.

11:55.049 --> 11:57.029
And my magic mirror is ruined.
