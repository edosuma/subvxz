WEBVTT

00:09.259 --> 00:10.885
Ba-bum.

00:12.095 --> 00:13.096
[croaks]

00:14.639 --> 00:15.890
[panting]

00:17.684 --> 00:19.978
[Callum]  Previously on
The Dragon Prince...

00:21.688 --> 00:22.522
I'm right here.

00:25.442 --> 00:26.526
What are you doing?

00:27.652 --> 00:29.154
Your kind of magic.

00:29.821 --> 00:32.407
[chanting]

00:37.537 --> 00:39.873
[roaring]

00:39.956 --> 00:41.791
[yelling]

00:42.709 --> 00:43.543
[exclaims]

00:46.713 --> 00:47.756
[groans]

00:49.549 --> 00:51.676
I... I can't move, Claudia.

00:52.260 --> 00:53.428
I can't move!

00:55.764 --> 00:58.183
Who... who are you?

00:58.975 --> 01:00.310
Ah...

01:01.436 --> 01:06.483
How long I have waited to hear
the sound of another voice.

01:07.275 --> 01:09.527
How may I serve you?

01:11.821 --> 01:13.823
[theme music playing]

01:29.047 --> 01:30.381
[roaring]

01:53.655 --> 01:58.034
[Rayla] Come on. We've gotta keep moving.
We're so close to the border.

01:58.576 --> 02:01.371
We could be in Xadia in just a few hours.

02:01.454 --> 02:04.499
I know we're close, Rayla,
but Callum's not doing well.

02:04.582 --> 02:07.460
That's his own fault
for messing with dark magic.

02:07.544 --> 02:12.173
Mmm-hmm. Yes, you're right.
We must move onward.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.176
I'm okay.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.679
I just need to rest my eyes while we walk.

02:30.608 --> 02:34.237
-I don't feel anything.
-Can you feel it when I do this?

02:34.821 --> 02:36.406
No, what are you doing?

02:36.489 --> 02:39.534
-I'm pinching you, Soren.
-Well, that's just rude.

02:40.535 --> 02:43.746
Hold on. I'll have you back
on your feet in no time.

02:50.920 --> 02:54.591
And the last step has just a tad
of grasshopper goop.

02:55.133 --> 02:57.343
Oh, do we really have to-- [gagging]

03:02.098 --> 03:04.017
[chanting]

03:13.860 --> 03:17.989
Well, that was super pretty,
but I still can't move.

03:18.072 --> 03:20.325
You can't? But that should have...

03:20.408 --> 03:22.368
Hold on. I must have something.

03:25.288 --> 03:27.457
Ugh, that's all I have for healing.

03:28.708 --> 03:30.627
Well, don't just stand there!

03:30.710 --> 03:34.088
Help me get him back to town.
We need to find a doctor.

03:43.723 --> 03:45.433
[Callum] I'm so uncomfortable.

03:45.516 --> 03:48.603
[Rayla] Uncomfortable with your choice
to use dark magic, perhaps?

03:48.686 --> 03:49.687
[Ezran] Rayla!

03:50.897 --> 03:52.315
Is that any better?

03:54.317 --> 03:55.818
So uncomfortable.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.364
[voice echoing]  I'm so uncomfortable!

04:13.211 --> 04:15.463
[gasps] Something's down there.

04:33.439 --> 04:34.274
No!

04:57.046 --> 05:00.049
We've searched everywhere.
Lord Viren is nowhere to be found.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.718
Keep looking.

05:01.801 --> 05:05.596
And when you do find him,
be ready for anything.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.348
Do not underestimate him.

05:16.733 --> 05:20.778
-Who are you?
-My name would mean nothing to you.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.990
[sighs] Where are you?

05:25.158 --> 05:27.285
I don't know.

05:27.910 --> 05:32.206
-Don't lie to me.
-I'm not lying. I never lie.

05:32.290 --> 05:33.333
[sighs]

05:33.416 --> 05:36.252
I found this mirror
in the lair of the Dragon King.

05:36.336 --> 05:40.548
This mirror meant something to him.
You meant something to him.

05:40.631 --> 05:41.883
Perhaps.

05:43.217 --> 05:47.180
Tell me what you need,
and I will help you.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.098
I need your name.

05:55.104 --> 05:57.065
Aaravos.

06:33.976 --> 06:35.144
Who are you?

06:38.356 --> 06:40.274
Who... who are you?

06:42.151 --> 06:45.404
-He's delirious.
-[Ezran] It's getting worse.

06:45.488 --> 06:46.948
[stones clinking]

06:51.911 --> 06:55.790
Who's there? Show yourself,
or I'll greet you with my pointy friends.

06:57.542 --> 06:58.626
You.

07:03.923 --> 07:04.757
[gasps]

07:07.468 --> 07:08.719
I'm not here to fight.

07:10.596 --> 07:13.641
My name is Corvus.
Your Aunt Amaya sent me.

07:26.028 --> 07:27.822
I am here to serve the king.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.036
King Ezran.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.937
Well? How long will it take
for him to get better?

08:00.688 --> 08:02.648
He's not going to get better.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.734
-What?
-He won't die.

08:04.817 --> 08:07.862
He's lucky to have survived
a direct attack from a dragon.

08:08.529 --> 08:10.364
But he's never going to walk again.

08:15.369 --> 08:17.497
I haven't told him yet.

08:17.580 --> 08:22.001
Don't. I'll tell him.
He should hear it from me.

08:24.253 --> 08:28.382
But I'm not the king.
I'm just a prince. My dad is...

08:29.258 --> 08:32.762
Wait. That's not what you're saying.
He isn't...

08:35.139 --> 08:40.061
-No! No, no, no!
-Ezran, it's going to be okay.

08:40.144 --> 08:44.482
You knew? I'm an idiot!
I should have figured it out.

08:44.565 --> 08:48.194
When we met you, you had two
of those assassiny ribbony things,

08:48.277 --> 08:50.112
but one of them came off that night.

08:50.696 --> 08:53.699
That's right.
That must have been when he fell.

08:54.408 --> 08:56.869
-"Fell"?
-Yes.

08:56.953 --> 08:59.413
"Fell"? He didn't fall, Rayla.

08:59.497 --> 09:01.791
He didn't trip and land on the ground.
He got killed!

09:05.378 --> 09:06.546
[gasps]

09:08.798 --> 09:11.467
Callum... does he know yet?

09:12.218 --> 09:13.219
He knows.

09:15.179 --> 09:16.847
I'm going for a walk.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.058
I can't let you go alone.

09:19.809 --> 09:23.354
If I am the king,
then you have to let me go.

09:26.440 --> 09:27.692
You're not my king.

09:28.568 --> 09:31.529
But you are my friend,
and I'm coming with you.

09:31.612 --> 09:33.155
[sighs] Rayla, please.

09:33.698 --> 09:36.367
Just let me go be alone. Please.

09:37.952 --> 09:40.246
-[Bait groans]
-[Zym yips]

09:43.583 --> 09:44.792
[whimpers]

10:18.326 --> 10:19.910
Let's see here.

10:19.994 --> 10:23.456
Aaravos... Aaravos...

10:23.539 --> 10:24.874
"Aaravos"! There!

10:27.251 --> 10:29.837
What? What's going on here?

10:32.465 --> 10:33.549
"Aaravos."

10:41.223 --> 10:42.141
[exclaims]

10:43.517 --> 10:44.769
What's happening?

10:44.852 --> 10:47.229
Shh! You're in a library.

10:47.313 --> 10:50.775
-Yes, I'm quite aware I'm in a--
-[woman] Shh!

11:08.084 --> 11:10.378
Callum, don't be frightened.

11:11.587 --> 11:13.214
I'm not, I'm just...

11:13.297 --> 11:14.340
[both] ...confused.

11:14.965 --> 11:16.092
Of course you are.

11:16.175 --> 11:19.845
You tried dark magic for the first time.
No one expects that to be easy.

11:20.429 --> 11:23.849
But that's the thing.
It was easy. Too easy.

11:24.433 --> 11:26.143
Even though I know it's wrong.

11:26.727 --> 11:29.522
-But is it really so wrong?
-Yes.

11:30.564 --> 11:32.817
-Is it, though?
-Yes.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.276
-Is it?
-Yes!

11:34.360 --> 11:35.361
[voice echoing]

11:37.405 --> 11:40.366
Callum, look at me.
You're looking at yourself.

11:40.908 --> 11:44.912
-You need to accept your destiny.
-I can't do that.

11:45.955 --> 11:47.081
You're a human.

11:47.665 --> 11:50.626
You weren't born with an Arcanum
to do primal magic,

11:50.709 --> 11:53.963
but you were born to do magic.

11:54.046 --> 11:56.257
The kind of magic humans can do.

11:57.049 --> 11:59.760
You can have unlimited power.

12:00.594 --> 12:03.806
And you can choose
what to do with that power!

12:03.889 --> 12:06.559
You can make
a real difference in the world.

12:06.642 --> 12:10.062
All you need to do now is accept it.

12:10.855 --> 12:13.023
Your destiny is already written.

12:23.659 --> 12:24.660
[sighs]

12:28.205 --> 12:29.206
[sighs]

12:33.461 --> 12:35.212
Hey, Sor-Sor.

12:36.630 --> 12:38.674
All the people in town
are talking about you.

12:38.757 --> 12:42.094
About how you faced the dragon
and saved the town.

12:42.636 --> 12:44.472
Everyone's calling you a hero.

12:44.555 --> 12:48.767
Saved them from a problem I caused, maybe.
Is that what heroes do?

12:51.312 --> 12:57.151
So I... I talked to the doctor.
And I guess they did some tests--

12:57.234 --> 12:59.278
-I already know.
-What?

13:00.112 --> 13:05.201
I can't move. I can't walk.
And it's not going to get better.

13:05.784 --> 13:07.036
[children laughing]

13:10.289 --> 13:14.668
You know what? It's for the best.
I'm glad I can't move.

13:15.211 --> 13:16.921
What are you talking about?

13:17.713 --> 13:19.798
Soren, why would you say that?

13:20.382 --> 13:23.469
Before we left,
Dad gave me a secret mission.

13:23.552 --> 13:24.470
He did?

13:25.095 --> 13:29.058
I was confused,
and I didn't want to do it, but...

13:29.683 --> 13:33.187
I do want Dad to love me
and be proud of me.

13:35.356 --> 13:37.983
He is proud of you, no matter what.

13:38.526 --> 13:42.821
Dad is so smart,
so I figured there must be a good reason.

13:42.905 --> 13:46.283
Soren, what did Dad ask you to do?

13:49.245 --> 13:50.246
Kill the princes.

13:51.372 --> 13:52.373
Kill them?

13:53.999 --> 13:55.584
[scoffs] No.

13:55.668 --> 13:58.712
No. No, that can't be right.
You must have misunderstood.

14:00.422 --> 14:02.967
Now I can't do anything terrible,
because...

14:03.884 --> 14:06.554
now I can't do anything.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.519
Accept your destiny.

14:22.361 --> 14:23.362
[Harrow] Callum.

14:25.239 --> 14:26.740
You are free.

14:27.449 --> 14:31.203
You are free from both the past
and the future.

14:31.287 --> 14:35.207
Nothing is written in stone.
Fate is a lie.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.835
You are free!

14:39.879 --> 14:45.092
Look inside yourself, Callum.
This is your destiny. You can't deny it.

14:58.981 --> 15:02.693
No! I get to choose who I want to be.

15:02.776 --> 15:05.905
Your destiny is already written!

15:05.988 --> 15:10.117
No! Destiny is a book you write yourself!

15:33.766 --> 15:37.478
[exhales heavily] That was horrifying.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.065
It's your dream, kid.

15:52.826 --> 15:54.161
The king is missing.

15:54.244 --> 15:56.664
He's not missing. He just went for a walk.

15:56.747 --> 15:59.416
And he hasn't returned,
and we don't know where he is.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.877
-Right.
-That is the definition of missing!

16:02.628 --> 16:05.297
Yeah. Yeah, you're right. He's missing.

16:05.381 --> 16:07.591
You shouldn't have let him go.
We need to find him.

16:08.342 --> 16:11.762
Aren't you a tracker?
Isn't this your whole job?

16:12.721 --> 16:16.058
Yes. I shall bring the king back safely.

16:16.141 --> 16:17.142
You have my word.

16:19.895 --> 16:23.065
-Ooh, I have his word.
-[Bait grunts]

16:25.943 --> 16:28.696
It's okay, Clauds. I'm relieved, actually.

16:28.779 --> 16:30.572
I'm... I'm free to do what I want,

16:30.656 --> 16:33.867
with no expectations from Dad or...
or anyone.

16:33.951 --> 16:37.621
So, what are you gonna do
with this newfound...

16:37.705 --> 16:38.706
freedom?

16:38.789 --> 16:41.208
I've been thinking about that
for the last ten minutes,

16:41.291 --> 16:44.670
and I've decided
I'm going to reinvent myself.

16:45.379 --> 16:47.214
I'm gonna be a poet, Claudia!

16:47.965 --> 16:50.342
[laughs]

16:52.970 --> 16:54.304
You're not joking?

16:54.388 --> 16:58.350
I'm going to be a poet,
and people will come hear my poems.

16:58.434 --> 17:03.022
They'll come visit me, and we'll drink
some kind of... soothing tea.

17:03.105 --> 17:06.608
And then... and then,
I'll say my latest poems to them.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.694
[sighs] Soren, are you sure?

17:08.777 --> 17:12.406
I already have my first poem.
It's a haiku.

17:12.489 --> 17:14.116
Just, uh, tell me when you're ready.

17:14.658 --> 17:18.620
[sighs] Um... okay. Ready.

17:19.163 --> 17:20.247
[inhales deeply]

17:21.165 --> 17:24.960
Dragon smash boy. Say the good words now.

17:25.502 --> 17:28.255
They light the hearts of other people.

17:30.549 --> 17:32.926
Do you like it? I'm inspiring, right?

17:33.010 --> 17:38.223
No, Soren, no. That was a terrible poem.
And it... it's not even a haiku!

17:38.891 --> 17:42.561
Oh... I can't leave you like this.
There has to be something.

17:53.864 --> 17:55.449
[objects shattering]

17:58.577 --> 18:00.204
You need to calm down.

18:00.287 --> 18:06.210
No, I don't. You need to... calm up!
You need to help him!

18:06.293 --> 18:08.087
This is a hospital.

18:08.170 --> 18:10.881
Miss, we're going to have
to assist you out of here.

18:10.964 --> 18:15.302
He can't be like this.
He can't even count syllables!

18:16.595 --> 18:17.888
[grunting]

18:17.971 --> 18:18.972
[yelps]

18:29.691 --> 18:31.360
[wind rushing]

18:34.488 --> 18:37.866
Ahoy, Callum! I hear ye be needing a boat.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.204
Am I be needing a boat?

18:42.287 --> 18:46.458
You am! For yer voyage!
Into yer own heart and mind.

18:50.546 --> 18:53.173
Let's hope the weather be nice there.

18:57.678 --> 18:59.179
[screaming]

18:59.263 --> 19:01.932
[laughing maniacally]

19:02.015 --> 19:05.060
-Hoist the mainsail!
-What?

19:05.144 --> 19:06.895
I don't know how to hoist any sails.

19:06.979 --> 19:11.859
It's yer journey.
You be the sail, and I'll hoist ye!

19:11.942 --> 19:15.612
-Find the wind, boy! Be like a wing!
-[screaming]

19:15.696 --> 19:17.322
[Villads laughing]

19:28.917 --> 19:31.336
[Berto squawks] I have questions.

19:47.060 --> 19:49.897
You're making this easy for me,
young King!

19:59.281 --> 20:02.409
Oh, no. This can't be happening.

20:11.793 --> 20:13.003
What's going on?

20:13.086 --> 20:17.257
Every time I found a mention of you
in an ancient scroll or tome,

20:17.341 --> 20:20.969
the entire passage disappeared
as soon as I looked!

20:21.053 --> 20:24.681
[sighs] What game are you playing?

20:38.820 --> 20:39.821
[sighs]

20:45.702 --> 20:46.745
Ugh!

20:46.828 --> 20:47.829
[sighs]

20:48.455 --> 20:50.791
Why should I trust you?

20:53.835 --> 20:57.297
You shouldn't... yet.

21:01.343 --> 21:02.552
[gulps]

21:07.683 --> 21:08.767
[clears throat]

21:14.773 --> 21:18.110
What's wrong? What happened?
Did you lose his trail?

21:18.193 --> 21:20.279
No. It's worse than that.

21:20.362 --> 21:21.446
What do you mean?

21:21.530 --> 21:26.618
King Ezran's trail ends very clearly,
very badly.

21:26.702 --> 21:29.288
His footprints are replaced
by banther tracks.

21:29.371 --> 21:32.207
-The king's been eaten by a banther!
-[gasps]

21:33.583 --> 21:38.463
[laughs] Great job.
You've lost the King of Katolis.

21:38.547 --> 21:40.841
This isn't funny. Why are you laughing?

21:40.924 --> 21:44.594
[sighs] Your king happens to be
a very special boy.

21:44.678 --> 21:46.471
He can talk to animals.

21:46.555 --> 21:48.265
So if there are banther tracks,

21:48.348 --> 21:52.769
it means Ezran caught a ride
on the banther, not in the banther.

21:52.853 --> 21:55.564
[laughing]

22:01.445 --> 22:03.739
Okay, Claudia, calm down.
Everything's going to be okay.

22:03.822 --> 22:05.782
Just... say your calming mantra.

22:05.866 --> 22:06.992
[sighs]

22:07.075 --> 22:08.827
There is no synonym for cinnamon.

22:08.910 --> 22:12.789
There is no synonym for cinnamon.
There is no synonym for cinnamon.

22:12.873 --> 22:15.500
There is no synonym for cinnamon.
There is no-- [gasps]

22:19.129 --> 22:21.048
[creature growling]

22:23.508 --> 22:24.676
[snarling]

22:31.266 --> 22:34.019
-Ezran?
-Hi, Claudia.

22:35.729 --> 22:37.355
[Callum groaning]

22:38.565 --> 22:39.566
[exclaims]

22:40.817 --> 22:42.194
[panting]

22:42.277 --> 22:44.237
You messed with something
you shouldn't have messed with,

22:44.321 --> 22:46.907
-and now you're paying the price.
-Help!

22:47.991 --> 22:48.867
Help.

22:49.409 --> 22:51.036
[Rayla] You'll get through this.

22:51.661 --> 22:52.537
[groans]

22:53.205 --> 22:54.915
You big dumb human.

23:46.508 --> 23:49.386
Your conscience is a messy place, boyo!

23:49.970 --> 23:52.222
[Berto cawing]

23:54.558 --> 23:56.852
[laughs] Villads out!

23:56.935 --> 23:59.312
[Berto] I'm huge!

24:02.190 --> 24:03.525
[gasping]

24:21.960 --> 24:22.794
[gasps]

24:22.878 --> 24:25.922
-[panting]
-Callum? Are you okay?

24:26.006 --> 24:28.216
-[gasping]
-Callum!

24:29.801 --> 24:30.802
[Rayla]  Callum!
