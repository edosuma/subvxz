WEBVTT

00:01.917 --> 00:03.086
Thanks, y'all,
for accompanying us

00:03.087 --> 00:05.666
to the Lil' Ladies Doll Palace.

00:05.667 --> 00:08.876
It's a sacred place
for both dolls and doll owners.

00:08.877 --> 00:11.546
Saxon insisted
we spend his birthday here.

00:11.547 --> 00:14.916
(as Saxon) "Here's to one more
full revolution around the sun!"

00:14.917 --> 00:17.666
This place smells like
cinnamon and desperation.

00:17.667 --> 00:19.256
Well, we're off to grab a table

00:19.257 --> 00:22.256
at the High Socie-Tea Room.
Y'all enjoy the store!

00:22.257 --> 00:23.876
Thanks, we won't.

00:23.877 --> 00:26.296
Finally, just the two of us,
Tilly girl.

00:26.297 --> 00:28.506
(as Saxon) "Well, what am I,
chopped liver?"

00:28.507 --> 00:29.666
Yeah-heh-heh...

00:29.667 --> 00:30.916
Since when do dolls

00:30.917 --> 00:32.876
need all this mollycoddlin'?

00:32.877 --> 00:34.206
They got a hair salon?

00:34.207 --> 00:36.006
A yoga studio?!

00:36.007 --> 00:39.836
- And what the heck
is a "hospi-doll"?
- Out of the way!

00:39.837 --> 00:42.416
We're losing her!
We're losing her!

00:42.417 --> 00:44.666
Back in my day,
they worked the farm

00:44.667 --> 00:46.086
just like everyone else.

00:46.087 --> 00:47.796
Here it comes.
"Back in my day,

00:47.797 --> 00:51.006
we had to slice our own bread
and rode dinosaurs to work."

00:51.007 --> 00:53.046
Boy, you ought
to learn some respect.

00:53.047 --> 00:56.706
Ooh! Now this
is what I'm talkin' 'bout!

00:56.707 --> 00:58.916
Takin' you on a tour
of these historical dolls

00:58.917 --> 01:00.506
ought to teach you some manners.

01:00.507 --> 01:03.916
Oh, Gramma. We both know
that lesson will never take.

01:03.917 --> 01:05.126
Hm? Oh, no. No, no, no.

01:05.127 --> 01:07.006
Help! Dad!

01:07.007 --> 01:10.546
Hmm. What's Bill gonna do
in a place like this?

01:10.547 --> 01:15.416
[sniffing] I smell...
sawdust and craftsmanship!

01:15.417 --> 01:16.916
[panting]

01:16.917 --> 01:20.586
A workstation! Power tools!
Construction materials?!

01:20.587 --> 01:21.966
Hi, there. Welcome to

01:21.967 --> 01:23.966
the Build a Lil' Dream Home
workstation.

01:23.967 --> 01:26.916
[shushing] I know just
what to do.

01:26.917 --> 01:28.626
All right, sug,
we're in the height

01:28.627 --> 01:31.546
of luxury now.
A table for two ladies

01:31.547 --> 01:33.376
and one birthday gentleman,
please.

01:33.377 --> 01:36.506
I'm really sorry. There's
gonna be another hour wait.

01:36.507 --> 01:39.626
Yeesh. Are you sure
there's nothin' you can do?

01:39.627 --> 01:41.916
It's someone's special day.

01:41.917 --> 01:42.966
[Tilly]
Hello!

01:42.967 --> 01:44.376
Trust me, ma'am.

01:44.377 --> 01:47.086
Everyone around here
is having a "special day."

01:47.087 --> 01:48.966
So step aside
until the next table

01:48.967 --> 01:51.586
opens up, plea--
[gasps] She's here!

01:51.587 --> 01:54.586
It's Miss Cantaloupe Sinclair!
She's a prestige member

01:54.587 --> 01:56.916
of the Lifetime
Lil' Ladies Club!

01:56.917 --> 01:59.046
- That's her!
- She's like doll royalty!

01:59.047 --> 02:01.046
Cantaloupe Sinclair?!

02:01.047 --> 02:02.466
Wait, I don't know who that is.

02:02.467 --> 02:04.466
Please come right in,
Miss Sinclair.

02:04.467 --> 02:06.876
Thank you, Jessica. Oh!
I've never seen

02:06.877 --> 02:09.006
that type of doll before.
What's his name?

02:09.007 --> 02:12.086
Well, this is
my burlap companion, Saxon.

02:12.087 --> 02:14.626
Oh, cute! Saxon,
you don't mind

02:14.627 --> 02:16.706
if me and my friends
head in first, right?

02:16.707 --> 02:20.086
Oh. Uh... (as Saxon)
"Of course! Go right ahead!"

02:20.087 --> 02:22.756
You're such a doll.
Hope to see you in there.

02:22.757 --> 02:24.466
Yep. See ya in there.

02:24.467 --> 02:26.836
Psh. Line cutters,
am I right?

02:26.837 --> 02:29.626
Oh, uh, yeah. Totally.

02:29.627 --> 02:33.006
Now, which historic doll
should we look at first?

02:33.007 --> 02:36.416
Ah, here's a good one!
This is Jezebel Jenkins!

02:36.417 --> 02:39.006
She was a general
in the Great War.

02:39.007 --> 02:41.006
Ugh! Being stuck
in this exhibit

02:41.007 --> 02:42.256
is my Great War. Aah!

02:42.257 --> 02:43.586
Oh, no, you don't!

02:43.587 --> 02:45.376
Fine. If I can't
escape physically,

02:45.377 --> 02:48.626
I'll just retreat
into my imagination. Hmm...

02:48.627 --> 02:50.836
- [rock music playing]
- Space motorcycle!

02:50.837 --> 02:52.666
Knock it off!
What'd I tell ya

02:52.667 --> 02:54.416
about usin' your imagination?

02:54.417 --> 02:55.876
Oh, look, Cricket!
Over there

02:55.877 --> 02:58.506
- are the pre-colonial dolls!
- [grunting]

02:58.507 --> 03:01.966
Those girls were pioneers.

03:01.967 --> 03:04.876
Heh. No one can box in
ol' Cricket Green.

03:04.877 --> 03:06.206
Huh?

03:06.207 --> 03:07.506
Oh, cheese curds.

03:07.507 --> 03:10.416
Help! Help! Dad!

03:10.417 --> 03:12.336
And with a couple
of modifications,

03:12.337 --> 03:14.166
this house'll soon
be up to code.

03:14.167 --> 03:15.966
- Wow! Very nice.
- Unbelievable.

03:15.967 --> 03:17.296
- [classical music]
- [Nancy] Phew!

03:17.297 --> 03:19.006
I'm glad we finally got a table.

03:19.007 --> 03:20.336
Might be all the way
in the back,

03:20.337 --> 03:22.916
but I'm sure we'll still
have a great time.

03:22.917 --> 03:24.916
Besides, being
right by the kitchen

03:24.917 --> 03:27.296
means we'll get our food fas--

03:27.297 --> 03:28.376
--ter.

03:28.377 --> 03:29.796
Oh, yes, Mama.

03:29.797 --> 03:31.126
We're gonna have
such a great time.

03:31.127 --> 03:33.796
Lots of fun things...
to do here...

03:33.797 --> 03:35.966
- [laughing]
- He's so funny! [laughs]

03:35.967 --> 03:37.296
Maybe it's time we bust out

03:37.297 --> 03:40.296
those homemade Tilly muffins
you brought!

03:40.297 --> 03:43.006
(as Saxon) "Muffins?
I'll take a baker's dozen!"

03:43.007 --> 03:44.296
Let's dig in!

03:44.297 --> 03:46.836
I wonder if those kids
would want a muffin.

03:46.837 --> 03:48.626
Well, why don't you go ask?

03:48.627 --> 03:51.206
Oh, no. I-- I wouldn't want
to bother them.

03:51.207 --> 03:54.876
Til, I don't think anyone's
ever been bothered by muffins.

03:54.877 --> 03:56.876
Well, if you insist...

03:56.877 --> 03:59.046
And I was like, "Yeah, duh!"

03:59.047 --> 04:02.796
- [both laughing]
- [Tilly laughing loudly]

04:02.797 --> 04:05.416
Oh, it's you again! Hi!

04:05.417 --> 04:06.876
I was wonderin' if any of you

04:06.877 --> 04:09.416
would like to try
one of my homemade muffins.

04:09.417 --> 04:11.836
I'm probably allergic
or something.

04:11.837 --> 04:15.006
Yeah. Allergic to garbage!
Hey-o!

04:15.007 --> 04:16.756
[both laughing]

04:16.757 --> 04:18.206
- I'd love one.
- [both gasp]

04:18.207 --> 04:21.206
- Oh, me, too!
- Yeah, I'd love some garbage!

04:21.207 --> 04:23.046
Uh... by all means.

04:23.047 --> 04:25.966
You'll have to excuse
my friends. These are great!

04:25.967 --> 04:28.876
Well, thank you. I made 'em
for Saxon's birthday!

04:28.877 --> 04:30.756
(as Saxon) "Don't ask me
what age I'm turnin',

04:30.757 --> 04:32.586
'cause I ain't tellin'!"

04:32.587 --> 04:35.836
- [chuckles]
- [both laugh performatively]

04:35.837 --> 04:37.756
I like you. You're fun.

04:37.757 --> 04:38.916
Would you and Saxon like to sit

04:38.917 --> 04:41.006
with me and my besties
forev-sies?

04:41.007 --> 04:42.916
[gasps] We'd love to!

04:42.917 --> 04:44.966
Just let me head over
and grab my mama so we can all--

04:44.967 --> 04:46.966
[Cantaloupe]
Oh, um, actually...

04:46.967 --> 04:49.836
I was kind of hoping
it could just be us kids.

04:49.837 --> 04:52.966
Oh. Uh. Yeah.
That should be fine.

04:52.967 --> 04:55.876
[whistling]
There you are, Tilly.

04:55.877 --> 04:58.416
Some crumpets fell off
the waiter's tray!

04:58.417 --> 05:00.836
Another perk of being
kitchen-adjacent, am I right?

05:00.837 --> 05:02.666
Oh, Mama. Those fancy kids

05:02.667 --> 05:04.756
want me and Saxon
to sit with them!

05:04.757 --> 05:06.296
That's wonderful, kiddo!

05:06.297 --> 05:08.916
Want us to take these floor
crumpets to go, then?

05:08.917 --> 05:10.836
Well, the thing is,
Cantaloupe said

05:10.837 --> 05:12.876
that it's a kids-only
type of party,

05:12.877 --> 05:17.336
and you know Saxon
really wants to go, so...

05:17.337 --> 05:20.506
Oh. Well. If Saxon
wants to go...

05:20.507 --> 05:22.086
No problem.

05:22.087 --> 05:24.916
Thanks, Mama! Gotta keep
the birthday boy happy!

05:24.917 --> 05:26.756
Come on, Saxon!
You're about to soar

05:26.757 --> 05:29.046
up the doll society ladder!

05:29.047 --> 05:31.836
Have fun! [sighs]

05:31.837 --> 05:33.006
[chomps, grunts]

05:33.007 --> 05:35.336
Look, Mama! That old lady

05:35.337 --> 05:37.916
likes talking
to her dollies, too!

05:37.917 --> 05:40.296
She was the rootinest,
tootinest sheriff

05:40.297 --> 05:41.876
west of the Mississippi!

05:41.877 --> 05:43.626
All right, come on, sweetie.

05:43.627 --> 05:45.916
You know, Cricket,
sometimes it's hard for me

05:45.917 --> 05:48.086
to tell ya how I feel,
but... I love ya--

05:48.087 --> 05:49.666
Oh, are ya kiddin' me?!

05:49.667 --> 05:52.877
Nobody makes a fool
outta Alice Green!

05:54.167 --> 05:56.296
Aah! [grunts]
Ohh, this ain't good.

05:56.297 --> 05:59.336
[grunting] Oh,
pickle sticks, I'm stuck!

05:59.337 --> 06:00.916
Where is that little menace?

06:00.917 --> 06:03.006
Gramma! Gramma, help me!

06:03.007 --> 06:06.586
Ooh! Hehe,
this is just perfect.

06:06.587 --> 06:08.796
Gee, Cricket,
would you look at that?

06:08.797 --> 06:11.836
That doll up there
looks exactly like you!

06:11.837 --> 06:14.836
- Ah, come on!
- Well, hello there, dearie.

06:14.837 --> 06:17.796
Say, would you like
to take home a new doll?

06:17.797 --> 06:20.506
[breathy grunting]

06:20.507 --> 06:21.966
Ohh, no.

06:21.967 --> 06:24.626
All right, Saxon,
we have arrived.

06:24.627 --> 06:27.796
Oh, hi, Tilly. Welcome back.
Please, have a seat.

06:27.797 --> 06:30.756
Great! Um, I'll have
to find a chair to pull up.

06:30.757 --> 06:32.466
You don't need to do that.

06:32.467 --> 06:34.876
Oh, Willow, you and your doll
are excused now.

06:34.877 --> 06:37.546
- Wh-What?!
- Wait, what, now?

06:37.547 --> 06:40.916
I said Willow's leaving,
so you can have her seat.

06:40.917 --> 06:42.966
I'm sure there's room
for everyone.

06:42.967 --> 06:46.706
If I let everyone sit with us,
then it wouldn't be special.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.706
Willow, you're OK
with this, right?

06:48.707 --> 06:51.546
Oh. Y-Yeah, sure. [grunts]

06:51.547 --> 06:53.296
Heh. Have fun, Tilly.

06:53.297 --> 06:56.126
OK... Well...
Thanks for havin' me!

06:56.127 --> 06:58.006
[breathy panting]

06:58.007 --> 06:59.296
Eh... Ehh...

06:59.297 --> 07:02.086
Gramma, this is drool
and unusual punishment!

07:02.087 --> 07:04.086
Wordplay won't save ya now, boy!

07:04.087 --> 07:05.166
Do ya give up?

07:05.167 --> 07:06.626
Yes, I'm sorry!

07:06.627 --> 07:08.796
Old dolls are cool or whatever!

07:08.797 --> 07:10.046
- Good enough.
- [yelps]

07:10.047 --> 07:13.466
Once again, Alice Green
comes out on top.

07:13.467 --> 07:15.376
Uhh... Listen, kid,
the joke's over.

07:15.377 --> 07:17.466
- Now, git!
- [screeches]

07:17.467 --> 07:18.916
[both scream]

07:18.917 --> 07:22.046
Ahh, all done. Ha-ha,
ain't she a beaut?

07:22.047 --> 07:24.376
Complete with electric,
workin' appliances,

07:24.377 --> 07:26.376
- and indoor plumbin'!
- [flushes]

07:26.377 --> 07:27.706
I-- I don't understand.

07:27.707 --> 07:29.836
You only used one piece of wood.

07:29.837 --> 07:31.206
Heh. How 'bout that.

07:31.207 --> 07:33.626
My whole life is a lie!

07:33.627 --> 07:35.086
- [screaming]
- How do ya turn
this thing off?!

07:35.087 --> 07:36.087
- [Bill] Hey, family!
- [coos]

07:36.088 --> 07:37.666
What's goin' on?

07:37.667 --> 07:40.166
[breathy babbling]

07:40.167 --> 07:41.966
Dollhouse made her
stop screamin'!

07:41.967 --> 07:43.586
Bill, give her that thing!

07:43.587 --> 07:44.876
What? Give her this?

07:44.877 --> 07:46.877
It's the house or your son.

07:49.257 --> 07:50.836
You're hesitating!

07:50.837 --> 07:53.586
Fine, you can take
the dollhouse.

07:53.587 --> 07:54.966
[happy babbling]

07:54.967 --> 07:56.836
You know, maybe
this is for the best.

07:56.837 --> 07:58.466
That little girl
can enjoy the dollhouse,

07:58.467 --> 08:00.006
and maybe when she
has kids of her own,

08:00.007 --> 08:01.046
-she can pass it on down to--
-[wood breaking]

08:01.047 --> 08:02.086
Uh, Dad?

08:02.087 --> 08:04.127
[laughing]

08:06.667 --> 08:09.336
Thanks again for havin' me
at your table, Cantaloupe.

08:09.337 --> 08:10.916
Just to had to make
a little room.

08:10.917 --> 08:14.086
Ashton, are you happy
with the changes at the table?

08:14.087 --> 08:16.666
Oh, yeah. Willow was the worst.
[laughs nervously]

08:16.667 --> 08:18.966
Seems like your friends kinda do

08:18.967 --> 08:20.506
whatever you tell them to do.

08:20.507 --> 08:23.086
Friends? Ashton
is more of a lackey.

08:23.087 --> 08:24.876
Watch this. Ashton,

08:24.877 --> 08:27.836
I've decided Tilly's muffins
aren't so great anymore.

08:27.837 --> 08:30.046
- Blech!
- But what?

08:30.047 --> 08:32.546
You see, Tilly. The people
who sit at this table

08:32.547 --> 08:35.546
are like my dolls. They say
what I want them to say,

08:35.547 --> 08:37.006
do what I want them to do.

08:37.007 --> 08:40.796
And now, you've joined
my collection!

08:40.797 --> 08:44.006
That's crazy! I'm not
just gonna do whatever you say!

08:44.007 --> 08:46.546
Oh, Tilly, you already have.

08:46.547 --> 08:48.876
You ditched your own mother
to sit with me.

08:48.877 --> 08:51.166
-No, no, I--
-Here's what you're gonna do.

08:51.167 --> 08:52.836
Throw out that disgusting sack

08:52.837 --> 08:54.916
and get a proper Lil' Lady doll.

08:54.917 --> 08:57.126
You're-- You're a bad person!
I can't believe

08:57.127 --> 08:59.876
I actually thought
sittin' at your table was cool!

08:59.877 --> 09:03.546
(as Saxon) "Here's how we feel
about your fancy table! Splash!"

09:03.547 --> 09:05.166
[gasps] Genevieve!

09:05.167 --> 09:07.466
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna head back

09:07.467 --> 09:10.756
to hang out with
the coolest kid
I know - my mama!

09:10.757 --> 09:13.006
Cantaloupe?

09:13.007 --> 09:15.416
- [Cantaloupe] Oh, Tilly?
- Huh? Aah!

09:15.417 --> 09:18.966
- [all gasp]
- And that is how I feel
about you.

09:18.967 --> 09:20.706
[giggles] Oof!

09:20.707 --> 09:21.796
- Wha--?
- [guitar sting]

09:21.797 --> 09:25.086
Nobody messes
with my little lady.

09:25.087 --> 09:28.916
- [screams]
- Dang, that kid
has anger issues.

09:28.917 --> 09:30.166
Oh! [growls]

09:30.167 --> 09:33.086
- [grunting]
- [all shouting]

09:33.087 --> 09:35.876
- [gasps]
- Tilly, you're OK!

09:35.877 --> 09:37.546
Only physically.

09:37.547 --> 09:39.916
Mama, I'm sorry I abandoned you.

09:39.917 --> 09:44.916
Saxon wanted-- I really wanted
to fit in with the fancy kids.

09:44.917 --> 09:47.706
Aw, Til, it's OK.
Seeing you stand up

09:47.707 --> 09:50.966
to that lil' dweebus
made me so dang proud of you!

09:50.967 --> 09:53.916
- I love you, sug!
- I love you, too, Mama.

09:53.917 --> 09:55.916
Now, come on.
Let's show these Lil' Ladies

09:55.917 --> 09:57.796
how the Green girls
have a food fight.

09:57.797 --> 09:59.876
With ya till the end, Mama!

09:59.877 --> 10:01.296
[all screaming]

10:01.297 --> 10:02.756
This place has gone nuts!

10:02.757 --> 10:04.546
We're gonna have to move on
without Nancy and Tilly.

10:04.547 --> 10:07.966
Every man for him--
Oh, hey, girls! How'd it go?

10:07.967 --> 10:09.916
Had some tea,
started a food fight.

10:09.917 --> 10:11.836
Pretty quality
mother/daughter time.

10:11.837 --> 10:15.256
Saxon says it was the best
birthday he coulda asked for.

10:15.257 --> 10:19.166
Tilly! Wait! Uh,
Juniper Bunderstitch
wanted to say something.

10:19.167 --> 10:20.796
(as Juniper) "I think
the way you stood up

10:20.797 --> 10:22.966
to Cantaloupe back there
was really cool.

10:22.967 --> 10:25.836
Do you think you'd want
to have tea together sometime?"

10:25.837 --> 10:27.586
(as Saxon) "Of course!
At our table,

10:27.587 --> 10:29.256
everyone is welcome!"

10:29.257 --> 10:31.007
