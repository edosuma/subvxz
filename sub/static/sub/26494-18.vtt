WEBVTT

00:00.265 --> 00:01.464
I am a Winchester!

00:01.754 --> 00:03.921
Jack, no!

00:10.332 --> 00:12.665
I'm me again.

00:14.336 --> 00:16.436
Jack, you have
your powers back?

00:20.575 --> 00:21.608
I think so.

00:21.610 --> 00:23.309
And your soul?

00:23.311 --> 00:25.145
You want to know
how much of my soul

00:25.147 --> 00:27.113
I had to burn off
to kill Michael.

00:27.115 --> 00:29.616
Yes.

00:30.685 --> 00:32.351
I don't know.

00:37.259 --> 00:39.926
Nick. He's trying
to resurrect Lucifer.

00:41.796 --> 00:44.164
I can get us to him.

00:44.166 --> 00:45.632
But I need
to use my powers.

00:45.634 --> 00:47.934
Do it.

00:47.936 --> 00:49.936
Stop!

00:49.938 --> 00:52.038
Jack, stop.
What are you doing?

00:54.209 --> 00:55.842
- Where's Nick?
- It's over.

00:55.844 --> 00:58.011
- What about Mom?
- She's fine.

00:58.013 --> 00:59.712
Everything's
gonna be fine.

01:02.350 --> 01:05.485
Nick, he was a bad person,
a killer. He deserved it.

01:05.486 --> 01:06.553
Not like that.

01:06.555 --> 01:08.021
- Leave me alone!
- Please. Just --

01:08.023 --> 01:09.556
- Leave me alone!
- Jack!

01:09.558 --> 01:10.857
Something's wrong.

01:10.859 --> 01:12.692
- Listen to me!
- Leave me alone!

01:14.429 --> 01:16.162
Mary?

01:32.581 --> 01:35.548
- Yo, Mom!
- Mom!

01:35.550 --> 01:38.651
Jack?

01:38.653 --> 01:40.353
Mom?

01:40.355 --> 01:42.855
- Hey, Jack?
- Jack?

01:42.857 --> 01:44.657
Jack?
Yo, anybody here?

01:44.659 --> 01:47.160
Mom?

01:47.162 --> 01:49.696
Mom?

01:49.698 --> 01:52.098
Jack?

01:56.204 --> 01:58.404
Nothing.

01:58.406 --> 02:00.206
They probably just stopped
for a bite on the way back.

02:00.208 --> 02:02.075
You know how Mom gets
after a Hunt.

02:02.077 --> 02:04.510
Yeah. True that.

02:04.512 --> 02:06.179
Well, hey,
here's to another

02:06.181 --> 02:08.214
miraculous Sam Winchester
survival.

02:09.050 --> 02:10.949
Got to say, man, if Jack
hadn't have healed you...

02:10.952 --> 02:13.052
You know, lately, it feels like

02:13.054 --> 02:14.700
we'd be up the creek
without that kid.

02:14.701 --> 02:15.440
Yep.

02:15.464 --> 02:16.724
I mean, first,
he takes care of Michael

02:16.725 --> 02:19.892
and then...Nick.

02:19.894 --> 02:22.028
Kind of sounds like you're
bummed about it.

02:22.030 --> 02:24.964
No. A "get out of
jail free" card?

02:24.966 --> 02:26.366
I'll take that.

02:26.368 --> 02:27.700
Gonna try Mom?

02:27.702 --> 02:28.801
Yeah.

02:44.286 --> 02:45.818
Looks like they left
in a hurry.

02:45.820 --> 02:47.287
Try Jack.

What did Jody say?

03:12.747 --> 03:14.314
She hasn't heard anything.
You?

03:14.316 --> 03:17.150
Nada. Left voicemails for
Donna, Charlie, Bobby.

03:17.152 --> 03:18.451
- Rowena?
- Yeah.

03:18.453 --> 03:20.320
Just got off the phone
with her.

03:20.322 --> 03:22.789
She says she has a spell
that might track them down.

03:22.791 --> 03:24.957
- Okay, well, that's good.
- Yeah.

03:28.663 --> 03:30.363
Hey, Cass.

03:30.365 --> 03:32.098
<i>I got your message.</i>

03:32.100 --> 03:33.866
Nick was trying
to raise Lucifer?

03:33.868 --> 03:36.102
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Where is he now?

03:36.104 --> 03:38.338
I don't, uh --
Kid said he took care of him.

03:38.340 --> 03:40.473
So, right now, we're just
trying to find Jack and Mom.

03:40.475 --> 03:43.643
- Are they together?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

03:43.645 --> 03:45.211
A-Alone?

03:45.213 --> 03:48.181
Y-Yeah.
W-Why do you --

03:48.183 --> 03:49.716
Yes, Cass, they were
together, alone.

03:49.718 --> 03:51.384
What's he saying?

03:51.386 --> 03:53.052
I don't...

03:53.054 --> 03:54.487
<i>Cass?</i>

03:58.560 --> 04:00.159
I, um...

04:00.161 --> 04:02.462
<i>If you have something to</i>
<i>tell us, now's the time.</i>

04:02.464 --> 04:05.064
I saw Jack. He -- He --
He did something

04:05.066 --> 04:06.566
when I got home
with Sam.

04:06.568 --> 04:09.836
I went to check on him,
and Felix was sick.

04:09.838 --> 04:12.271
- Felix? You mean the snake?
<i>- Yes.</i>

04:13.708 --> 04:16.809
Jack used his powers.

04:16.810 --> 04:18.111
He killed the snake.

04:19.314 --> 04:21.314
<i>I think Jack</i>
<i>considered it a mercy.</i>

04:21.315 --> 04:22.915
I-I was gonna
tell you, but...

04:22.917 --> 04:25.051
You just wanted to wait until
we were already freaked out.

04:25.053 --> 04:27.220
I'm sorry.

04:27.222 --> 04:29.355
I don't think
Jack is well, Dean.

04:29.357 --> 04:31.657
<i>Dean?</i>

04:35.663 --> 04:36.996
- What?
- He said that Jack

04:36.998 --> 04:38.931
went all Kevorkian
on his snake.

04:38.933 --> 04:41.267
- Why?
- I don't know. Who cares.

04:41.269 --> 04:42.502
It's a snake.

04:42.504 --> 04:44.237
Right now,
we've got to find them.

04:46.741 --> 04:49.542
I think I have an idea.

04:49.544 --> 04:52.011
This will work?

04:52.013 --> 04:54.747
As long as Jack's battery's
running, probably.

04:54.749 --> 04:56.616
There we go.
Look.

04:56.618 --> 04:58.251
Wait. Is that...?

04:58.253 --> 04:59.852
Nepal?

05:02.924 --> 05:05.458
Wait a second.
W-Where'd he go?

05:06.795 --> 05:08.027
There.

05:08.029 --> 05:11.264
Lima, Peru.

05:11.266 --> 05:13.099
Jack's flying.

05:13.101 --> 05:15.535
Paris, France.

05:20.241 --> 05:22.408
What the hell
is he doing?

06:03.852 --> 06:05.518
You knew my mother.

06:05.520 --> 06:07.353
I was there
when you were born.

06:08.857 --> 06:10.490
Stop!

06:10.492 --> 06:14.827
Jack, what you did
was...amazing.

06:14.829 --> 06:18.965
Jack, please!
Just -- Listen to me!

06:18.967 --> 06:20.132
Leave me alone!

06:32.847 --> 06:34.780
Nick?

06:34.782 --> 06:37.683
Mm. Guess again.

06:40.855 --> 06:43.656
"Hello, Son."

06:43.658 --> 06:46.626
No. That's not possible.
You're --

06:46.628 --> 06:48.995
Dead?

06:48.997 --> 06:52.565
All right.
You got me.

06:52.567 --> 06:55.701
I'm not Nick.
I'm not Lucifer.

06:55.703 --> 06:56.769
I'm you.

06:58.172 --> 06:59.839
What?

06:59.841 --> 07:03.209
Yeah. I'm your, you know,
subconscious or whatever.

07:03.211 --> 07:05.378
Y-You whipped me up to
help you figure this out.

07:09.984 --> 07:13.886
Whatever you are...

07:13.888 --> 07:15.488
I don't want your help.

07:15.490 --> 07:17.990
Actually, you do.

07:17.992 --> 07:20.393
So I'm gonna give you a little
piece of advice, bud,

07:20.395 --> 07:24.931
how you can wiggle out of
this little pickle you're in.

07:24.933 --> 07:26.933
You don't.

07:28.836 --> 07:30.736
You won't.

07:30.738 --> 07:32.238
You can't.

07:32.240 --> 07:34.106
All right?

07:34.108 --> 07:38.177
Buddy, you killed
Mary Winchester.

07:38.179 --> 07:42.014
You cannot come back from that,
and you know it.

07:42.016 --> 07:44.016
All right? You've been
flapping your wings all around,

07:44.018 --> 07:45.618
trying to run away
from what you did,

07:45.620 --> 07:47.853
and where'd you wind up?

07:47.855 --> 07:51.691
Right here, right back
to the scene of the crime.

07:51.693 --> 07:53.392
- No.
- Yeah.

07:53.394 --> 07:56.195
Yeah, because somewhere
inside, you realize

07:56.197 --> 07:59.565
that the sooner you accept it,
the easier it'll be.

07:59.567 --> 08:01.801
No, it's...

08:04.405 --> 08:06.739
It was an accident.

08:06.741 --> 08:08.374
Okay.

08:08.376 --> 08:10.376
Tell Sam and Dean that.

08:10.378 --> 08:11.744
I'm sure
they'll understand.

08:11.746 --> 08:13.412
It's not like family
isn't everything to them.

08:13.414 --> 08:14.814
- Shut up.
- No, I'm serious.

08:14.816 --> 08:16.482
Pull out your cellphone
right now and call them.

08:16.484 --> 08:19.085
Shut up!

08:34.836 --> 08:38.004
All right.
Cass is gonna meet us there.

08:42.143 --> 08:44.143
You know, maybe Jack
was wrong, you know?

08:44.145 --> 08:45.811
I mean, maybe
Nick pulled it off,

08:45.813 --> 08:47.747
maybe Lucifer's back,
and he took them both.

08:47.749 --> 08:50.583
And -- And Jack --
I mean...

08:50.585 --> 08:53.786
he must have thought he was
helping, you know, being kind.

08:53.788 --> 08:55.021
What?

08:55.023 --> 08:57.657
With...Felix.

08:57.659 --> 09:00.359
Wait. Really?
With the snake?

09:00.361 --> 09:02.261
I'm just saying, Dean.

09:02.263 --> 09:04.997
I'm trying to understand
Jack without a soul.

09:04.999 --> 09:06.532
We don't know that
he doesn't have a soul!

09:06.534 --> 09:08.701
Okay, I don't want to --
Let's --

09:08.703 --> 09:10.870
Let's just not talk
about it, all right?

09:10.872 --> 09:14.507
Let's just find Mom.
We'll find Jack.

09:14.509 --> 09:17.043
We'll figure it all out.

09:18.346 --> 09:19.545
All right.

09:22.984 --> 09:25.117
- Uh-oh.
- What?

09:59.087 --> 10:01.821
You look inside.
I'll take around back.

10:18.039 --> 10:20.706
Jack?

10:33.588 --> 10:35.721
Mom?!

11:00.114 --> 11:01.747
Dean!

11:09.824 --> 11:12.324
Dean?

11:17.431 --> 11:18.931
Dean.

11:18.933 --> 11:22.501
In the cabin,
it's -- it's...

11:51.415 --> 11:53.082
Well, that was
a close one.

11:53.084 --> 11:55.617
Not that close.

11:58.155 --> 12:00.255
I counted wrong.

12:00.257 --> 12:03.692
I thought there were only
two vamps in the basement.

12:03.694 --> 12:05.594
I handled the third one.

12:05.596 --> 12:07.029
Yes, you certainly did.

12:07.031 --> 12:08.464
Mmm.

12:08.466 --> 12:11.300
You know, I'm no expert,
but I think most humans

12:11.302 --> 12:15.204
would bandage an open wound
before stopping to eat.

12:15.206 --> 12:18.440
It's a scratch.

12:18.442 --> 12:20.809
Still...

12:20.811 --> 12:22.044
I could heal you.

12:25.116 --> 12:26.882
If you'll let me.

12:28.719 --> 12:30.552
I'm -- I'm okay.

12:32.056 --> 12:35.057
Are you still
afraid of me?

12:38.062 --> 12:39.495
Maybe a little.

12:42.700 --> 12:45.801
I haven't been back
that long.

12:45.803 --> 12:48.337
Angels are real.
Angels are friends.

12:48.339 --> 12:51.507
Angels can heal you
with a wave of a glowy hand.

12:51.509 --> 12:54.943
I -- It's all
pretty new still.

12:57.715 --> 12:59.915
We should get back.

12:59.917 --> 13:01.116
Boys will be waiting.

13:18.235 --> 13:21.603
I know you know this, Mary,
but, um...

13:21.605 --> 13:24.773
Sam and Dean -- they're --
they're glad to have you back.

13:24.775 --> 13:27.910
Whatever you still
have to deal with

13:27.912 --> 13:30.579
and however long it takes,

13:30.581 --> 13:32.414
you should know
they're happy.

13:33.684 --> 13:38.587
I mean, finally, they don't
have to be so, um...

13:38.589 --> 13:40.589
so alone.

13:46.463 --> 13:49.464
Castiel.

13:49.466 --> 13:51.533
They were never alone.

13:53.804 --> 13:55.971
They were never alone.

14:20.130 --> 14:21.630
Dean, if Jack did that...

14:21.632 --> 14:23.398
Hey, we don't know
what happened, okay?

14:23.400 --> 14:25.000
I mean, we don't know
what Nick did.

14:25.002 --> 14:26.969
He probably deserved it.

14:26.971 --> 14:29.304
Dean, look. No one wanted
Nick dead more than I did,

14:29.306 --> 14:31.974
but...I mean, that...

14:35.679 --> 14:36.812
Cass.

14:39.984 --> 14:41.450
Is that Nick?

14:41.452 --> 14:43.085
Yeah.

14:43.087 --> 14:47.522
We looked around.
No sign of Jack or Mom.

14:47.524 --> 14:50.659
There's a, um, blast site
behind the house.

14:50.661 --> 14:54.329
It looks angelic,
just...bigger.

14:54.331 --> 14:56.164
Might have been
Lucifer.

14:56.166 --> 14:57.799
Nick was trying
to bring him back.

14:57.801 --> 14:59.301
- Yeah, but Jack said --
- Who cares what Jack said?

14:59.303 --> 15:00.802
We don't know
what happened!

15:00.804 --> 15:05.007
But I swear, if he did
something to her, if she is...

15:06.110 --> 15:08.910
Then you're dead to me.

15:10.614 --> 15:11.980
- Dean.
- No, he knew.

15:11.982 --> 15:14.049
He knew something
was wrong with the kid.

15:14.051 --> 15:16.151
He knew it,
and he didn't tell us!

15:16.153 --> 15:18.053
He didn't even tell us!

15:24.061 --> 15:26.128
I was scared.

15:26.130 --> 15:29.264
I believed in Jack
for so long, I...

15:30.668 --> 15:35.704
I believed that he was --
he was good.

15:35.706 --> 15:38.740
I -- I knew that he would be
good for the world.

15:38.742 --> 15:41.243
And he was good for <i>us.</i>

15:43.347 --> 15:47.749
My faith in him,
it -- it never wavered,

15:47.751 --> 15:50.752
and then I-I saw what he did.

15:52.890 --> 15:55.057
It wasn't malice.
It wasn't evil.

15:55.059 --> 15:56.858
It was like Jack saw a problem,

15:56.860 --> 15:59.928
and in his mind, he just
solved it with that snake.

15:59.930 --> 16:02.030
The snake?!

16:02.032 --> 16:05.367
What he did wasn't bad.

16:05.369 --> 16:08.103
It was the absence of good.

16:08.105 --> 16:09.905
And I saw that in him.

16:09.907 --> 16:14.242
But we were a family,
and I didn't want to lose that,

16:14.244 --> 16:17.379
so I thought I could...
fix it on my own.

16:17.381 --> 16:19.348
Felt like it was
my responsibility.

16:19.350 --> 16:23.118
So I left.
And I didn't tell you.

16:23.120 --> 16:26.021
If I could go back
and just --

16:26.023 --> 16:29.758
just talk to him right
then and there, I would.

16:29.760 --> 16:31.860
But I can't, Dean.

16:31.862 --> 16:34.896
I failed you.

16:34.898 --> 16:37.532
And I failed Jack.

16:37.534 --> 16:38.967
And I failed --

16:38.969 --> 16:41.870
No, no. Don't even say it.
Don't even say her name.

16:41.872 --> 16:43.605
Dean.

16:50.481 --> 16:51.646
Who is it?

16:51.648 --> 16:53.248
Rowena.

16:53.250 --> 16:56.084
Hey.

16:56.086 --> 16:59.087
<i>Hello, Samuel.</i>
<i>I did what you asked.</i>

16:59.089 --> 17:02.324
I used scrying magic on the boy,
tried to find him.

17:02.326 --> 17:04.593
<i>But his energy,</i>
<i>it's too unstable.</i>

17:04.595 --> 17:06.328
<i>It was like</i>
<i>looking at the sun.</i>

17:06.329 --> 17:07.496
And Mom?

17:09.433 --> 17:10.433
Say it!

17:13.270 --> 17:17.005
<i>I don't know what happened</i>
<i>or where she is...</i>

17:17.007 --> 17:19.974
<i>but I can tell you</i>
<i>with certainty...</i>

17:19.977 --> 17:22.844
Mary Winchester
is no longer on this Earth.

18:03.387 --> 18:05.987
So, what do we do?

18:07.157 --> 18:09.524
What do we always do
when we lose one of our own?

18:11.161 --> 18:13.462
We fight.

18:13.464 --> 18:15.564
We fight
to bring them back.

18:15.566 --> 18:17.032
How?

18:17.034 --> 18:19.100
Billie?

18:22.039 --> 18:25.240
Rowena. She's got
the Book of the Damned.

18:25.242 --> 18:28.143
She's resurrected herself
more times than we can count.

18:28.145 --> 18:30.378
How? We don't even know
where your mother is.

18:30.380 --> 18:33.915
Then go to heaven
and find her!

18:37.087 --> 18:38.987
Tell Rowena
we're on our way.

18:49.666 --> 18:54.536
"Magice Necromantiorum."

18:57.441 --> 18:58.773
That was fast.

19:00.844 --> 19:04.145
Oh, boy.

19:11.755 --> 19:13.855
Hello, Rowena.

19:19.617 --> 19:23.018
Are you --
Are you well?

19:24.387 --> 19:25.803
Sam and Dean
are looking for you.

19:25.804 --> 19:27.603
I-I could call them.

19:27.605 --> 19:28.938
No!

19:28.940 --> 19:30.773
I need help.
I need magic.

19:30.775 --> 19:32.308
Why?

19:37.015 --> 19:39.716
I killed Mary.

19:47.625 --> 19:49.726
I-It was an accident.
I-I didn't mean to.

19:49.728 --> 19:51.461
I just -- I just wanted her
to be quiet.

19:51.463 --> 19:53.396
I just wanted her gone,
but only for a second.

19:53.398 --> 19:56.733
And I just..

19:57.969 --> 20:00.136
I thought it.

20:03.641 --> 20:06.175
It all happened
so fast.

20:09.748 --> 20:11.714
I need to undo it.

20:13.251 --> 20:15.852
You need to
help me undo it.

20:18.857 --> 20:21.324
I, uh...

20:21.326 --> 20:23.760
The magic
I've used on myself,

20:23.762 --> 20:27.063
my -- my little
subdermal sachets --

20:27.065 --> 20:29.265
they only work
as fail-safes.

20:29.267 --> 20:32.135
They have to be prepared
in advance, Jack.

20:33.538 --> 20:35.037
Um...

20:36.341 --> 20:37.940
What about the book?

20:37.942 --> 20:40.510
The book. Yes. Yes.
The -- The book.

20:40.512 --> 20:44.514
I mean, there --
there is a spell.

20:44.516 --> 20:48.885
Agnes, the witch
who created the Book,

20:48.887 --> 20:51.220
was a prisoner
for years.

20:51.222 --> 20:53.389
She was obsessed
with breaking curses.

20:53.391 --> 20:56.759
What is death
but the ultimate curse?

20:56.761 --> 21:00.396
In captivity, her friends,
her only companions

21:00.398 --> 21:01.864
starved and perished,

21:01.866 --> 21:04.634
so she developed a spell
to bring them back --

21:04.636 --> 21:09.205
the "Magice
Necromantiorum."

21:13.244 --> 21:15.144
Okay.
What will we need?

21:15.146 --> 21:18.114
Oh, well, um...

21:18.116 --> 21:21.818
the Necromantiorum
requires enormous power.

21:21.820 --> 21:25.455
The ingredients are
relatively simple.

21:25.457 --> 21:28.558
Um, nothing
you wouldn't have...

21:28.560 --> 21:30.993
handy in the bunker.

21:32.697 --> 21:34.997
Rowena?!
Open up!

21:34.999 --> 21:36.966
You've been stalling me...

21:36.968 --> 21:38.668
- Rowena?!
- ...tricking me!

21:38.670 --> 21:40.903
Just talk to them, Jack.
They're your kin.

21:40.905 --> 21:42.338
Come on! Open up!

21:52.116 --> 21:54.383
Hello?

22:00.158 --> 22:02.225
Hello?

22:17.108 --> 22:19.141
Naomi.

22:27.051 --> 22:29.285
- Jack!
- Come on.

22:44.536 --> 22:46.302
- Okay.
- Outward position.

22:46.304 --> 22:48.538
- Right. Index.
- Index finger.

22:48.540 --> 22:49.872
- Flip.
- Thumb.

22:49.874 --> 22:51.173
No, keep your finger
over there.

22:51.175 --> 22:52.508
- All right.
- Thumb.

22:52.510 --> 22:54.810
And then switch it
all around.

22:54.812 --> 22:57.179
There you go.
Right.

22:57.181 --> 23:00.182
Outward position.
Index, flip...

23:02.754 --> 23:05.922
That's okay.
That one was close.

23:05.924 --> 23:07.390
That's enough for today.

23:07.392 --> 23:10.726
You're doing great.
It's not easy.

23:11.930 --> 23:16.098
When we get Dean back,
he's gonna kill me for this.

23:24.275 --> 23:25.908
For what?

23:34.552 --> 23:37.086
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:37.088 --> 23:39.055
How's his training
coming along?

23:39.057 --> 23:43.025
He's got heart.
He'll get there.

23:43.027 --> 23:46.462
I feel bad. I've been so busy
looking for Dean...

23:46.464 --> 23:49.632
Sam, everyone here understands
what you've been doing

23:49.634 --> 23:51.701
and what you've been
putting yourself through.

23:51.703 --> 23:53.902
Yeah, I know, but Jack's
been through a lot --

23:53.926 --> 23:54.972
you know, losing his powers.

23:54.973 --> 23:57.106
And I haven't really
been there for him.

23:59.911 --> 24:02.478
Sorry, Mom. I don't mean
to lay all this on you.

24:02.480 --> 24:05.247
No. Are you kidding?

24:05.249 --> 24:08.584
It's nice knowing
I'm not the only one...

24:08.586 --> 24:11.087
with parental guilt.

24:11.089 --> 24:13.923
How much did the two of you
go through

24:13.925 --> 24:15.791
when I wasn't there
for you?

24:15.793 --> 24:19.495
And even when Amara brought me
back and I got a second chance,

24:19.497 --> 24:22.498
things got complicated.

24:22.500 --> 24:23.933
I got complicated.

24:23.935 --> 24:25.067
Mom.

24:25.069 --> 24:26.469
No, I'm just saying...

24:26.471 --> 24:28.604
parenting is always
a struggle.

24:28.606 --> 24:31.240
You always feel like
you're failing,

24:31.242 --> 24:34.577
but then you look at them,
and somehow, they're amazing.

24:36.347 --> 24:40.850
And somehow,
they're literally...

24:42.120 --> 24:44.253
...the bravest...

24:44.255 --> 24:46.255
kindest...

24:48.926 --> 24:50.993
...most heroic men
on the planet.

24:57.635 --> 24:59.869
Kids.

25:01.839 --> 25:04.040
They'll always
surprise you.

25:13.117 --> 25:15.484
Well, how the hell are we
supposed to keep up with Jack

25:15.486 --> 25:17.053
when he's got wings, huh?!

25:17.055 --> 25:19.455
And now he's got Rowena?
He's got the Book of the Damned?

25:19.457 --> 25:21.824
I don't know what to do.
I don't even know where to go!

25:25.396 --> 25:28.764
Cass.
Cass should have told us.

25:28.766 --> 25:30.633
As soon as he saw Jack
go all Dahmer

25:30.635 --> 25:33.736
on his stupid freakin' snake,
he should have told us.

25:33.738 --> 25:35.971
Dean, it wasn't just Cass.

25:35.973 --> 25:39.341
It wasn't.

25:39.343 --> 25:42.545
We knew Jack was dangerous.
We always knew.

25:42.547 --> 25:46.916
Long before he killed Michael.
You more than anyone.

25:46.918 --> 25:49.885
I mean, from the very
beginning, you knew.

25:49.887 --> 25:51.687
But, you know,
we fell for him

25:51.689 --> 25:55.024
'cause he had a good heart
and a good soul.

25:55.026 --> 25:56.225
Then he didn't.

25:56.227 --> 25:59.361
And that's on me, too,
by the way.

25:59.363 --> 26:02.364
I mean, I'm the one who made
the call to bring him back.

26:02.366 --> 26:04.066
He didn't ask for that.

26:04.068 --> 26:07.536
I decided <i>for</i> him.
And you warned me.

26:07.538 --> 26:10.072
No, you didn't know, okay?
We didn't know.

26:10.074 --> 26:12.108
Exactly.
We didn't know.

26:12.110 --> 26:15.811
But --
He had become our family.

26:21.285 --> 26:23.719
You know, after Maggie

26:23.721 --> 26:27.923
and the other Hunters
died...

26:27.925 --> 26:30.626
I just left.

26:32.196 --> 26:34.630
Just...

26:34.632 --> 26:37.299
dumped Jack on Cass
and left.

26:40.938 --> 26:44.640
I knew. I mean,
I knew something...

26:44.642 --> 26:48.444
was gonna...

26:48.446 --> 26:50.412
I just didn't know
it'd be this.

26:56.287 --> 26:58.120
I did it, too.

27:00.391 --> 27:02.925
When I talked to Donatello
about Jack,

27:02.927 --> 27:06.829
he said he was good
as far as he could tell.

27:06.831 --> 27:08.831
But then he talked
about how powerful Jack was

27:08.833 --> 27:13.302
and that he could never
really be sure.

27:13.304 --> 27:16.172
And it was a warning.

27:17.909 --> 27:21.544
I just couldn't see it.

27:27.151 --> 27:29.785
Are you done yet?

27:29.787 --> 27:31.587
I said they were
simple ingredients,

27:31.589 --> 27:33.022
but there are
a lot of them,

27:33.024 --> 27:35.291
and they need to be
compounded precisely.

27:38.963 --> 27:44.667
You know, I could have
fought you back at my flat.

27:44.669 --> 27:48.337
I'm not saying I would have won,
but I could have tried.

27:48.339 --> 27:51.040
I didn't because
you want the same thing

27:51.042 --> 27:53.542
the boys want,
that I want.

27:56.214 --> 27:59.448
No offense, buddy,
but this is just so sad.

28:03.054 --> 28:04.887
Jack?

28:06.490 --> 28:09.892
Bringing the witch bitch into
your desperate little plan?

28:09.894 --> 28:12.995
Why? So you can "make things
right" with the Winchesters?

28:12.997 --> 28:14.363
You stop it.

28:14.365 --> 28:16.498
Excuse me?

28:18.636 --> 28:21.737
It's -- It's fine.
Um...

28:21.739 --> 28:24.240
Just...

28:24.242 --> 28:27.543
What do you want?
Forgiveness?

28:27.545 --> 28:30.212
You want gratitude for
bringing Mommy back?

28:30.214 --> 28:34.650
Why? So you can call
this dump home again?

28:34.652 --> 28:36.752
So you can ease
your guilt?

28:36.754 --> 28:39.922
But you don't have guilt
anymore, do you, Jack?

28:39.924 --> 28:41.757
Admit it.

28:41.759 --> 28:43.826
You don't feel
anything anymore.

28:43.828 --> 28:45.895
Shut up.

28:48.566 --> 28:50.532
Are you okay?

28:50.534 --> 28:52.601
Keep working.

28:55.172 --> 28:57.740
You know this torment
that you're feeling right now?

28:57.742 --> 29:00.910
It's just a reflex.
It's just a habit, man.

29:00.912 --> 29:03.412
It's -- It's an echo
from when you actually

29:03.414 --> 29:05.114
could feel something,
when it mattered.

29:05.116 --> 29:06.448
- Mnh-mnh.
- But you know what?

29:06.450 --> 29:09.285
The sooner you give up
this little fantasy,

29:09.287 --> 29:11.186
the sooner this phantom pain
can go away.

29:11.188 --> 29:13.522
- No. Shut up.
- Mnh-mnh. Not gonna.

29:13.524 --> 29:16.058
And you know what, Jack?
It's not gonna work.

29:17.528 --> 29:19.728
You know
it's not gonna work.

29:19.730 --> 29:22.998
You know it.
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

29:29.206 --> 29:31.540
Are you done yet?
Are you done?!

29:31.542 --> 29:33.108
Yes.

29:34.578 --> 29:37.212
We have
everything we need.

29:37.214 --> 29:38.447
All but the last thing.

29:43.387 --> 29:45.154
The last thing.

29:45.156 --> 29:46.755
Her body.

29:53.798 --> 29:56.498
Naomi.

29:56.500 --> 29:59.969
I'm still here,
and I'm not going anywhere,

29:59.971 --> 30:02.905
not until I have a word
with you.

30:13.985 --> 30:15.417
Dumah.

30:15.419 --> 30:17.419
- Castiel.
- Where's Naomi?

30:17.421 --> 30:19.688
Well, I'd tell you
it's none of your business,

30:19.690 --> 30:23.292
but you already know
it's none of your business.

30:26.263 --> 30:27.596
Why are you here?

30:27.598 --> 30:28.797
I'm looking for someone.

30:28.799 --> 30:30.199
Mary Winchester?

30:31.335 --> 30:34.036
If that's why you're here,
then you should leave now.

30:34.038 --> 30:36.038
Why? There may be a way
to bring her back.

30:39.343 --> 30:41.143
Why would you want
to do that?

30:41.145 --> 30:42.644
Because she's gone.

30:42.646 --> 30:44.747
She is at peace.

30:46.617 --> 30:50.319
You know,
she died painlessly.

30:50.321 --> 30:52.788
Instantly. Completely.

30:52.790 --> 30:56.458
She's in Heaven,
a special Heaven.

30:56.460 --> 31:00.529
Mary Winchester
is complete.

31:04.301 --> 31:07.069
You and the Winchesters
may not be.

31:09.206 --> 31:11.340
But she is.

31:13.544 --> 31:16.478
Jack?

31:16.480 --> 31:18.247
I brought you
to the right place.

31:18.249 --> 31:20.516
We have the right
ingredients.

31:20.518 --> 31:22.951
Where's the body, Jack?

31:26.457 --> 31:28.323
- We can do this.
- That's --

31:28.325 --> 31:30.759
You will make it work!

31:31.695 --> 31:35.197
It won't. I can't.

31:37.401 --> 31:39.935
Then I'll do it myself.

31:39.937 --> 31:42.771
You're in no condition.

31:42.773 --> 31:45.674
Jack, a cardinal rule
of magic --

31:45.676 --> 31:48.577
disposition affects execution,
and you are spinning!

31:53.417 --> 31:56.418
Whatever you bring back,
it won't be her.

31:56.420 --> 31:57.553
Then help me!

32:00.524 --> 32:03.559
I won't.

32:21.412 --> 32:23.278
Ugh!

32:30.721 --> 32:33.655
Rowena, hey.
We just left your place.

32:33.657 --> 32:35.457
Well, I'm back!

32:35.459 --> 32:40.095
Listen. Jack is using magic
to try to bring your mom back.

32:40.097 --> 32:42.598
- Can he do that?
<i>- There's no body.</i>

32:42.600 --> 32:44.800
<i>And your boy,</i>
<i>he snapped.</i>

32:44.802 --> 32:48.971
He's desperate.
Confused, angry.

32:48.973 --> 32:50.606
You have to try to stop him.

32:50.608 --> 32:53.342
- Why?
<i>- Necromancy is a delicate art.</i>

32:53.344 --> 32:57.312
It's unpredictable
under <i>ideal</i> circumstances.

32:57.314 --> 32:59.781
<i>In his state,</i>
<i>oh, I fear your boy</i>

32:59.783 --> 33:01.550
will bring back
something terrible.

33:29.280 --> 33:33.348
<i>Id quod mortuum, nunc oriatur.</i>

33:33.350 --> 33:37.686
<i>Hoc quod cecidit,</i>
<i>nunc revertatur.</i>

33:37.688 --> 33:42.691
<i>Id quod mortuum, nunc oriatur.</i>

33:42.693 --> 33:46.295
<i>Hoc quod cecidit,</i>
<i>nunc revertatur.</i>

34:12.848 --> 34:15.547
<i>Hoc quod cecidit,</i>

34:15.550 --> 34:17.917
<i>nunc revertatur.</i>

34:20.722 --> 34:23.623
<i>Orimini.</i>

34:23.625 --> 34:25.058
<i>Ori...</i>

34:25.060 --> 34:26.426
<i>mini.</i>

34:30.565 --> 34:32.032
What the hell?

34:32.034 --> 34:34.534
- What are you doing?
- The engine just stopped.

34:37.072 --> 34:39.773
<i>Orimini.</i>

34:39.775 --> 34:42.475
<i>Orimini!</i>

34:42.476 --> 34:45.312
<i>Orimini!</i>

34:47.282 --> 34:48.748
Jack.

35:09.838 --> 35:12.005
Jack.

35:21.516 --> 35:24.150
It didn't work.

35:28.256 --> 35:30.824
No, no. No.

35:34.363 --> 35:37.464
Mom? Mom.

36:51.757 --> 36:54.124
Well, I warned you.

36:58.930 --> 37:03.133
It's worse --
trying and failing.

37:05.170 --> 37:08.104
There's no going back.
You realize that now.

37:08.106 --> 37:13.610
Cass, Sam, Dean...

37:13.612 --> 37:15.478
they're never gonna
trust you again.

37:17.182 --> 37:22.051
And you know
what <i>that</i> means.

37:22.053 --> 37:23.987
What?

37:25.957 --> 37:28.458
You can never
trust <i>them.</i>

38:08.266 --> 38:09.866
Cass.

38:17.108 --> 38:18.908
She's in Heaven.

38:22.247 --> 38:26.282
And she's at peace.

38:31.923 --> 38:34.224
So Naomi
told you, huh?

38:34.226 --> 38:37.527
Dumah, actually.

38:37.529 --> 38:40.463
So, what? Are you just gonna
take her word for it?

38:40.465 --> 38:43.366
No.

38:43.368 --> 38:45.568
No, she let me in.

38:51.109 --> 38:55.311
I saw your mother's Heaven,
and she is happy.

38:59.951 --> 39:01.918
She's with John,
and there's no sorrow.

39:01.920 --> 39:03.920
There's no guilt.

39:03.922 --> 39:06.122
Just joy.

39:12.564 --> 39:14.564
I talked to Rowena.

39:14.566 --> 39:17.600
Um, she said

39:17.602 --> 39:20.703
she thinks that what
Jack brought back...

39:23.308 --> 39:25.608
He just brought back
a shell.

39:29.514 --> 39:32.015
A body, you know.
That it was empty.

39:32.017 --> 39:34.918
Just a...

39:34.920 --> 39:37.353
a replica.

39:38.957 --> 39:42.358
"Incapable of holding life."

39:46.598 --> 39:48.998
So, what are we
supposed to do now?

39:52.938 --> 39:54.537
What we always do.
