00:00.010 --> 00:01.990
'Previously on Broadchurch...'

00:02.040 --> 00:04.510
~ How do you plead?
~ Not guilty.
~ No!

00:04.560 --> 00:06.790
I'll do everything I can
to secure a conviction,

00:06.840 --> 00:09.830
but it's not just down to me.
It's on everyone in this town.

00:09.880 --> 00:12.680
~ "It's already way past midnight."
~ Oh, damn!

00:15.000 --> 00:18.870
This investigation was compromised
by your personal liaisons

00:18.920 --> 00:22.720
~ with DI Hardy.
~ I am NOT the guilty one here! I am not!

00:23.240 --> 00:25.590
There are two families
back in Sandbrook.

00:25.640 --> 00:30.110
The Gillespies still don't know
who killed their daughter. The
Newberys don't even have a body.

00:30.160 --> 00:35.390
~ You got DI Hardy in charge?
~ Yeah.
~ My daughter's killer is still
out there because of that man!

00:35.440 --> 00:37.750
Ricky and David Gillespie.
Dads to the two girls.

00:37.800 --> 00:41.800
~ Two dads - two brothers
you barely even looked at.
~ Why did you send Claire a bluebell?

00:43.360 --> 00:46.360
~ Claire, what happened that night?
~ He drugged me.

00:46.440 --> 00:49.680
I woke up at 5am and he was
cleaning the whole house.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:03.720 --> 02:06.120
Yeah, still holding for Mr Davies.

02:06.840 --> 02:10.039
No, no, I don't want to
reschedule. I want to erm...

02:10.320 --> 02:13.190
talk to him about an
increase in my symptoms.

02:17.960 --> 02:21.240
What, is he some higher mortal
who doesn't phone people (?)

02:22.400 --> 02:24.400
My GP? Seriously? For...

02:25.320 --> 02:28.470
Oh, God, what do you want?

02:28.520 --> 02:31.520
Lee Ashworth came into
our offices the other day.

02:31.960 --> 02:33.990
Now, I couldn't place him at first,

02:34.040 --> 02:37.440
but then... I went through all
the Sandbrook press cuttings.

02:38.240 --> 02:41.440
It's a bit of a coincidence,
you and him both here.

02:42.280 --> 02:46.560
~ Does your editor know you're here?
~ I'm a bit fed up with
the way you talk to me.

02:47.560 --> 02:51.510
Is he dangerous? Why's
he here? I think you know.

02:51.560 --> 02:54.640
~ Leave this alone.
~ Why? He might have a story to tell.

02:56.320 --> 03:00.710
~ I'm just doing you the courtesy
of asking you first.
~ You people think you're saving the world.

03:00.760 --> 03:03.230
You just make it harder to live in.

03:04.720 --> 03:06.720
Piss off! Go on.

03:16.040 --> 03:20.230
~ Did you, though?
~ Did I what?
~ Shag him. "Oh, harder, Hardy" (!)

03:20.280 --> 03:23.910
~ I didn't go near him! I
wouldn't. Have you seen him?
~ I quite like the look of him.

03:23.960 --> 03:26.550
I like a troubled man. Not
as troubled as you do, but -

03:26.600 --> 03:29.350
None of it is true. Make sure
everybody understands that.

03:29.400 --> 03:32.590
~ Oh, who cares! Everyone
knows what a trial's like.
~ No, they don't.

03:32.640 --> 03:37.270
They don't know what it's like until
you're up there, telling the truth
and being painted as a liar.

03:37.320 --> 03:40.200
It's my turn this morning. Any tips?

03:40.320 --> 03:42.320
Just stick to the facts.

03:43.200 --> 03:47.390
~ I saw Joe that night.
~ No, you saw a man who you didn't
name. Don't go adding stuff.

03:47.440 --> 03:51.960
We both know it was him, Ell, and I'm
the only one who saw him that night.

03:52.640 --> 03:55.440
Just stick to the truth
and you'll be fine.

03:59.560 --> 04:03.440
Good, hoped I'd catch you. How are
you feeling? Any sign of the whiplash?

04:04.600 --> 04:08.200
Why didn't we know that DS Miller
visited DI Hardy's hotel room?

04:08.840 --> 04:12.470
~ Who did they talk to that we didn't?
~ I am not sure.
~ Well, you should be.

04:12.520 --> 04:17.230
~ I'm not going to lose this case because
my... junior isn't on every detail.
~ I did actually -

04:17.279 --> 04:21.510
Well, you have to be better. No fact
unchecked, no detail too small.

04:21.560 --> 04:23.560
Understood.

04:25.560 --> 04:28.100
I'm a prizefighter. I'm Willie Pep...

04:29.000 --> 04:31.070
.. and Willie Pep never
liked taking punches.

04:31.120 --> 04:33.830
~ Sorry, Willie who?
~ Everything you need to know about a trial

04:33.880 --> 04:38.760
can be found in the boxing ring. Now, you
study boxing, you'll see who Willie Pep is.

04:40.040 --> 04:44.400
~ OK.
~ After Lucy Stevens, I want to close
by giving the defence a bloody mouth.

04:45.240 --> 04:49.030
~ Now, how am I gonna do that, Ben?
~ Actually, that's what I came to tell you.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.480
I think we might've found someone.

04:59.160 --> 05:01.990
Why didn't you wake me? I'm
gonna miss the start of court.

05:02.040 --> 05:06.160
Thought you needed the sleep. Here you
are, sit down and I'll make you a tea.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.470
~ What's got into you, cheery?
~ Me and Lizzie watched the sunrise.

05:11.520 --> 05:14.800
~ You took her out?
~ Yeah. Movement of the
car sends her to sleep.

05:15.680 --> 05:18.680
Then we just sat there.
It was beautiful, Beth.

05:19.560 --> 05:22.600
~ Wow. Good for you.
~ Yeah, and I've been thinking about...

05:23.680 --> 05:27.750
Well, about a bit of time off,
you know? My paternity leave.

05:27.800 --> 05:32.240
~ Your what?
~ I could take a few weeks, or
something, or... a month - maybe more.

05:33.040 --> 05:35.040
What's brought this on?

05:37.080 --> 05:40.080
I missed it, with Chloe and Dan,
didn't I? The whole thing.

05:41.480 --> 05:44.990
All that sitting around and spending
time, and watching and feeding

05:45.040 --> 05:48.720
and... changing nappies, even.
It don't come again, does it?

05:49.200 --> 05:51.540
I want to hold onto it this time.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.240
Oh, bloody hell!

06:16.480 --> 06:18.480
Here you go. I've got it.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.950
I hope you're not following me.

06:22.040 --> 06:24.640
Says the woman who
had me recorded (!)

06:25.960 --> 06:28.360
I heard they trashed you in court.

06:29.800 --> 06:31.800
Hurts, doesn't it?

06:32.000 --> 06:35.550
~ Yeah, well, I'm sure
the jury saw through it.
~ It's like a game to them.

06:35.600 --> 06:40.390
Don't care about you, what you've
lost: husband, son, job -

06:40.440 --> 06:43.440
I haven't lost my son and
now I'm running late.

06:44.440 --> 06:46.440
Hardy slept with my wife.

06:47.600 --> 06:50.400
That's why he's so obsessed
with the case.

06:50.720 --> 06:53.790
~ What's that got to do with me?
~ He's poisoned my own wife against me,

06:53.840 --> 06:56.580
even though I tried
to help him solve it.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.720
I just want Claire back.

06:58.960 --> 07:02.480
Well, I've talked to her. Stay away
from her. You are not good for her.

07:08.800 --> 07:12.320
~ He paid for your parking?
~ He said you slept with Claire Ripley.

07:13.400 --> 07:18.710
~ I'm going up there, Miller.
~ Where?
~ Sandbrook, this weekend. You can drive me.
~ What? No, I'm not a taxi!

07:18.760 --> 07:22.990
~ I've got better things to do!
~ There is an officer there I can
talk to about reopening the case.

07:23.040 --> 07:26.400
~ See the place for yourself. Leave wee...
~ Fred!
~ Fred with your sister.

07:29.840 --> 07:34.040
I'd been playing a
bit of online poker...

07:34.640 --> 07:38.680
and then I went to the window
to close the curtains.

07:38.960 --> 07:43.880
~ What time was this?
~ 4:47am. I checked it on the computer.

07:44.360 --> 07:47.750
And what did you see when you went
to the window to close the curtains?

07:47.800 --> 07:51.320
A man putting a bag into
a bin across the street.

07:52.960 --> 07:57.760
~ Can you describe the man?
~ I saw the defendant, Joe Miller.

08:01.840 --> 08:04.150
You're certain of the man's identity?

08:04.200 --> 08:07.480
He's my brother-in-law, I should
be able to recognise him.

08:08.520 --> 08:13.310
Your statement to the police stated that
you couldn't identify the person you saw.

08:13.360 --> 08:17.590
No, I did tell them. Not sure why
they didn't put it in the statement.

08:17.640 --> 08:20.240
~ (What is she doing?)
~ (I wish I knew.)

08:21.720 --> 08:23.720
Thank you.

08:25.960 --> 08:28.960
We'll need the officer
who took this statement.

08:30.600 --> 08:34.230
Looking at the date of your
statement, Miss Stevens,

08:34.280 --> 08:40.000
you didn't go to the police until
57 days after seeing the man you
claim to be the defendant.

08:40.320 --> 08:43.630
I didn't connect it to Danny's
death until a few weeks later.

08:43.679 --> 08:47.920
Really? Despite it being
the talk of your town?

08:48.400 --> 08:51.830
Despite your own sister being one
of the investigating officers?

08:51.880 --> 08:54.360
I know this is everyday for you,

08:55.440 --> 08:58.640
but the rest of us haven't lived
through this before. It was new.

08:58.800 --> 09:03.870
The facts of your evidence are:
finally you make a statement,

09:03.920 --> 09:09.320
57 days after having seen
a figure on a dark street,

09:09.520 --> 09:12.990
but you forget to name the
man you claim to have seen.

09:13.040 --> 09:16.030
I didn't forget, the police
didn't put it in the -

09:16.080 --> 09:19.640
And today, for the first time,
you say it was Joe Miller.

09:19.800 --> 09:22.470
~ You're having the court on, aren't you?
~ I know what I saw.

09:22.520 --> 09:26.120
You might have seen a man, but you
didn't see the defendant, did you?

09:27.320 --> 09:29.660
Why have you changed your story?

09:30.960 --> 09:33.830
I know what my own
brother-in-law looks like,

09:34.160 --> 09:36.500
and I'd know him from miles off.

09:37.920 --> 09:40.190
I saw him out there that night.

09:48.640 --> 09:51.830
Come on, how was that? Did
I play a blinder, or what?

09:51.880 --> 09:53.880
I can't even talk to you.

10:14.240 --> 10:17.320
How are you getting on with that
new bad-character evidence?

10:17.400 --> 10:21.240
She's done it deliberately.
New witness, late notice...

10:22.800 --> 10:26.440
Not enough grounds for
us to successfully object.

10:27.240 --> 10:32.360
Sneaky move! I'd be impressed
if I wasn't so irritated.

10:32.680 --> 10:35.790
~ They claim they've only just found her.
~ Yeah, right (!)

10:35.840 --> 10:39.720
Jocelyn likes to end big. Lodge
a point in the mind of the jury.

10:43.360 --> 10:47.520
Mr Miller and I worked for two years
together, between 1996 and 1998.

10:48.160 --> 10:52.160
We were shift partners working as
paramedics at Cardiff City Hospital.

10:52.520 --> 10:55.320
Can you describe Mr
Miller as a colleague?

10:55.520 --> 10:57.510
A bit quiet, kept himself to himself.

10:57.560 --> 11:02.960
~ When did you stop working together?
~ It was November 1998, two
days after Bonfire Night,

11:03.120 --> 11:06.120
~ and it was at my request.
~ Why did you request it?

11:06.720 --> 11:09.990
Joe had offered to give me
a lift to get some shopping.

11:10.040 --> 11:13.550
The supermarket car park was really
busy. Then he saw a space,

11:13.600 --> 11:18.600
but this bloke in a BMW came in the other
way, the wrong way, and got in ahead of him.

11:18.960 --> 11:24.480
~ What did the defendant do then?
~ He jumped out the car, ran across
and punched the guy in the face.

11:25.200 --> 11:30.640
The bloke fell back against the
car and Joe started kicking him,
going at him really hard!

11:31.080 --> 11:34.480
~ Did you try and stop him?
~ When I realised what was going on, yeah.

11:34.880 --> 11:37.350
By the time I got there though,
the guy was bleeding.

11:37.400 --> 11:41.440
He ended up with three broken ribs and
it took four people to pull Joe off him.

11:42.200 --> 11:46.190
Had there been any warning signs that
Mr Miller might have a violent tendency?

11:46.240 --> 11:49.800
~ Nothing. It came out of nowhere.
~ Thank you.

11:57.080 --> 12:00.000
Is it a high-pressure
job being a paramedic?

12:00.560 --> 12:05.680
It can be... but on that day, we had
a good run and even had some time off.

12:07.040 --> 12:10.880
How many lives did Mr Miller save in
the two years that you worked together?

12:11.680 --> 12:15.120
~ I don't know.
~ Two, three?
~ More like 50 or 60.

12:16.280 --> 12:18.630
It doesn't make what
he did right, though.

12:18.680 --> 12:22.150
But you never saw any sign of
this behaviour before that day?

12:22.200 --> 12:25.870
He blew. I saw him go. It was like
a switch had been flipped in him.

12:25.920 --> 12:29.840
~ Thank you.
~ Scared the life out of me.
He nearly killed that guy!
~ Thank you!

12:31.200 --> 12:35.270
Willie Pep: 241 fights, 229 wins.

12:35.320 --> 12:39.440
Reportedly claimed he could win a fight
without throwing a single punch.

12:42.600 --> 12:45.600
That concludes the case
for the Crown, My Lady.

12:50.480 --> 12:55.430
I'll be away one night, maybe
two. I've asked Bob from the
station to pass by twice a day.

12:55.480 --> 12:59.560
This is his number - you call him if
you're worried about anything at all.

13:00.120 --> 13:02.120
You still mad at me?

13:03.160 --> 13:07.720
~ What about Ellie - why
can't she stay with me?
~ She's coming with me.
~ Oh. Dirty weekend away (?)

13:09.680 --> 13:12.780
When I get back, we'll talk
about what we do next.

13:13.520 --> 13:17.020
Just remember - don't go near
him. He's not good for you.

13:17.640 --> 13:21.280
Take it. Go on. Lock all the doors.

14:01.120 --> 14:06.550
~ How did you sleep?
~ Crap. Annoyed about those last two
witnesses. I wasn't quick enough on my feet.

14:06.600 --> 14:10.560
~ You did fine.
~ No, I didn't. Still, there's
plenty of time left.

14:11.920 --> 14:16.040
~ Now, strategy.
~ Hm!
~ When it boiled down to
it, what did they have?

14:17.040 --> 14:19.040
Forensics from the hut.

14:19.200 --> 14:22.670
Er... pathology which
doesn't rule our man out

14:22.720 --> 14:25.510
~ or conclusively prove that he did it.
~ That's right.

14:25.560 --> 14:29.390
Email and phone trails from Joe to Danny,
Danny's phone in Joe's possession...

14:29.440 --> 14:33.670
~ and the sister's supposed sighting.
~ Oh, don't start me off on that!
~ Right.

14:33.720 --> 14:37.280
So our big decision is, do
we put Joe Miller in the box?

14:37.840 --> 14:41.990
~ Jury will probably read into it if we don't.
~ But then we're at the
mercy of his performance.

14:42.040 --> 14:45.240
Plus Jocelyn - I don't want
her having a run at him.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.710
How watertight is his
account of that night?

14:49.760 --> 14:54.950
~ Says he was in bed, next to his wife.
~ But she can't corroborate, because
she took a sleeping pill.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.270
She can't say he wasn't there.

14:58.560 --> 15:01.560
Let's try him out, you
and me, see how he does.

15:03.440 --> 15:08.560
Oh, we also need an alternate killer. Who
do you fancy? Some juicy possibilities!

15:09.160 --> 15:13.440
~ Abby, do you ever listen to yourself?
~ What?

15:14.000 --> 15:19.400
~ These are people's lives you're talking
about. Have some sensitivity.
~ Of course.

15:19.920 --> 15:24.920
Absolutely. But, due respect, we
do need a credible alternative.
Who do you think's best placed?

15:25.560 --> 15:28.300
I'd have thought that
was pretty obvious.

15:50.760 --> 15:55.720
I remember, when Fred was this small,
he used to grip my thumb in his hand.

15:57.680 --> 16:00.310
Yeah, Tom, mate, I think
we need to have a chat.

16:00.360 --> 16:04.000
I er... I can't go on
meeting you here, mate.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.760
~ Why not?
~ Well, with the baby, I just...

16:09.960 --> 16:14.550
You know, I don't have the same amount of time.
I need to think about her now, don't I?

16:14.600 --> 16:19.550
Well... maybe we could
just meet less often?

16:19.600 --> 16:21.600
I don't think so.

16:24.200 --> 16:29.230
And people will start getting the
wrong idea, you know? I haven't
really been thinking straight.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.550
~ I'm sorry.
~ So that's it, then?

16:32.880 --> 16:36.990
You're just gonna leave me? Like
my dad, like... like my mum?

16:37.040 --> 16:40.160
Your mum hasn't left you. She's
not left. You should talk to her.

16:41.040 --> 16:43.480
~ Go.
~ I'm sorry -
~ Just go, OK?

17:11.480 --> 17:13.560
Do you like lasagne?

17:14.040 --> 17:17.520
It's a long time since somebody
cooked for me. Well, thank you.

17:18.560 --> 17:20.760
How do you think we're doing?

17:21.680 --> 17:25.839
We've put in a strong case.
Hold your nerve, Beth.

17:26.960 --> 17:30.160
~ We are gonna win, aren't we?
~ Of course we are.

17:34.200 --> 17:37.520
What made you change your mind?
Why did you take the case?

17:39.320 --> 17:42.480
Joe Miller found himself a
Rottweiler to defend him. Hm!

17:44.040 --> 17:46.380
She knows how to play the system.

17:47.400 --> 17:52.680
And your Danny... he used
to deliver my newspaper.

17:55.560 --> 17:57.560
This was on his round?

17:59.480 --> 18:02.480
He was a good boy. Someone
has to speak for him.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.400
Where were you on the night that Daniel
Latimer was murdered, Mr Miller?

18:10.760 --> 18:13.200
I was at home in bed with my wife.

18:13.280 --> 18:17.680
~ Did you have any contact with Daniel
Latimer the previous morning?
~ No.

18:19.080 --> 18:22.560
~ Did you send him a text message
when you returned from holiday?
~ No.

18:22.800 --> 18:27.440
We have your phone records which show that
a text message was sent from your phone.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.520
~ Not by me.
~ Then who?
~ I don't know. My wife.

18:31.600 --> 18:36.680
Then why were your DNA and prints found on
the phone used to send the text message?

18:36.920 --> 18:39.550
~ I don't know.
~ How did you get to the hut that night?

18:39.600 --> 18:43.430
~ I didn't go to the hut.
~ What did you use to clean the hut?
~ I didn't clean the hut.

18:43.480 --> 18:46.750
Why did you decide to move Danny's
body from the murder scene?

18:46.800 --> 18:48.030
I wasn't...

18:48.080 --> 18:51.070
I didn't move it at all. I hadn't
seen him for days, weeks...

18:51.120 --> 18:53.630
~ Is it days or is it weeks?
~ Weeks.

18:53.680 --> 18:55.710
We were on holiday. Three weeks.

18:55.760 --> 18:59.160
~ How many times did you meet
Danny before that night?
~ I don't know.

19:02.600 --> 19:06.840
I didn't meet him. We never met. We never
met there. He was just a friend of my son's.

19:08.240 --> 19:11.720
OK. He's a disaster. We
can't put him in the box.

19:11.920 --> 19:14.910
We're gonna need a parade of
character witnesses and experts,

19:14.960 --> 19:17.720
each one short, sharp, fully briefed.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.350
We can't prove his innocence, so
we discredit the idea of his guilt.

19:21.400 --> 19:26.440
~ Shit, Sharon, he totally did it.
~ Don't. I don't ever want
to hear you speak like that.

19:26.960 --> 19:30.040
We don't know for sure.
He gets his defence.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.920
Yes. Sorry.

19:37.880 --> 19:41.040
Look at us, Thelma and Louise
(!) You can be Susan Sarandon.

19:43.960 --> 19:47.550
Leave the radio alone! If you can't find
anything you like, just turn it off.

19:51.160 --> 19:54.790
Right, so if we're not having music,
you can at least tell me your theory.

19:54.840 --> 19:58.550
With everything you know, what do
you reckon happened at Sandbrook?

19:58.600 --> 20:01.950
Someone went into the Gillespie
house, abducted both girls.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.040
~ Got rid of the bodies.
~ Why Lee Ashworth?

20:06.400 --> 20:10.960
Ricky and Cate Gillespie said Pippa always
used to like going next door to see Lee.

20:13.560 --> 20:16.870
If Ashworth was in their house,
there must've been forensics.

20:16.920 --> 20:19.470
Yeah, there were. Ashworth's
DNA was all over the place.

20:19.520 --> 20:23.600
~ A strand of his hair was
found on Pippa's pillow.
~ What was his argument?

20:23.720 --> 20:27.070
That he'd been in the house plenty
of times, which is true, but...

20:27.120 --> 20:30.420
he still wouldn't say how
the hair got on the pillow.

20:31.520 --> 20:34.390
At one stage, he said it had
been put there to frame him.

20:34.440 --> 20:36.920
By who? This... Ricky, Pippa's Dad?

20:38.080 --> 20:40.280
That's what Ashworth claimed.

20:44.280 --> 20:48.710
But this case, Miller, whenever you think you're
getting close, it slips away from you.

20:48.760 --> 20:52.260
Is that why it got to you -
cos you could never be sure?

20:55.280 --> 20:58.480
I found her - Pippa Gillespie.
She was in the river.

21:21.640 --> 21:24.640
And it were deeper than I
thought. I got pulled under.

21:35.320 --> 21:38.440
Just managed to get free and
carry her body onto the bank.

21:40.640 --> 21:43.180
She'd been in there maybe three days.

21:48.720 --> 21:50.720
Water rots the body.

21:54.760 --> 21:57.230
She was the same age as my daughter.

22:05.440 --> 22:07.910
I can still feel the weight of her,

22:09.480 --> 22:12.280
water dripping off her
clothes all down me.

22:16.800 --> 22:19.800
What sort of a person leaves
a child like that?

22:29.280 --> 22:32.920
Mr Ashworth! Lee, right?

22:35.560 --> 22:40.350
~ Who are you?
~ Er, Olly Stevens, Broadchurch Echo. I
saw you when you came in to place your ad.

22:40.400 --> 22:46.320
~ I didn't give my name.
~ Yeah, well, I get why. I recognised
you. I know a bit about your case.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.540
I don't want to talk to you.

22:52.200 --> 22:56.270
~ Why did you come down here?
~ I don't want to talk to you.
~ Cos DI Hardy's here?
~ Was I not clear?

22:56.320 --> 22:59.470
~ Don't you want to put
your side of the story?
~ No, I don't.

22:59.520 --> 23:03.600
One conversation - five minutes, here,
now. Clear your name, everyone moves on.

23:04.280 --> 23:08.480
~ Our readers would love to
hear what you have to say.
~ You need to leave - now.

23:27.840 --> 23:32.390
I keep replaying my evidence over
and over, thinking of all the things
I should've said differently,

23:32.440 --> 23:35.670
~ all the comebacks I should've thrown at her.
~ You did the best you could.

23:35.720 --> 23:39.230
There's an epitaph - "Ellie Miller,
she did the best she could" (!)

23:39.280 --> 23:42.840
~ What if Joe gets off?
~ He won't.
~ What if he does?
~ He won't, Miller.

23:43.520 --> 23:46.720
~ I don't know what I'd do.
~ First left, second right.

23:49.160 --> 23:51.160
Down here on the left.

23:52.360 --> 23:54.360
Yeah, this pair here.

23:57.920 --> 24:00.390
~ Who lives there now?
~ The Gillespies own both houses.

24:00.440 --> 24:05.080
They rented the one on the right
to Lee and Claire. Cate still
lives in the one on the left.

24:06.280 --> 24:11.480
~ Even after everything that's gone on?
~ She wanted to be there,
in case Lisa came back.

24:16.720 --> 24:18.720
Let's go to the hotel.

25:33.080 --> 25:37.480
~ How can they have just lost your booking?
~ Shut up, at least we got the last room!

25:44.840 --> 25:49.960
~ I'll sleep in the car.
~ Don't be daft.
~ If Joe's legal team found out -
~ So? They've already accused us of it.

25:50.880 --> 25:55.400
~ Don't be stupid. Especially
not in your condition.
~ It's not a condition!
~ It totally is.

25:56.360 --> 25:59.560
Look, it's been a long drive. We'll
just take half the bed each.

25:59.680 --> 26:03.640
I'll sleep under the covers, you
sleep on top. Just don't snore.

26:09.880 --> 26:11.880
How is it?

26:44.160 --> 26:48.240
~ You're on the covers.
~ Sorry.
~ Thanks.

26:55.600 --> 26:57.740
Shall I turn the light off?

27:07.720 --> 27:09.720
Bit weird.

27:12.920 --> 27:15.950
You never answered me. Did you
ever have sex with Claire Ripley?

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Go to sleep, Miller.

28:19.760 --> 28:21.760
What are you doing here?

28:29.940 --> 28:33.140
~ You've been using this
place a lot, have you?
~ Yeah.

28:34.780 --> 28:38.620
Well, you can't, now I've come
back. I don't want visitors.

28:42.100 --> 28:44.440
He don't usually remember people.

28:47.500 --> 28:51.220
~ Why did you leave?
~ What's it got to do with you?

28:53.380 --> 28:56.250
Well, they arrested my
Dad for killing Danny.

29:00.340 --> 29:03.140
~ I heard about that.
~ He says he's innocent.

29:04.900 --> 29:06.900
They all say that.

29:11.860 --> 29:15.180
~ How's your Mum?
~ I'm... I... live with my aunt now.

29:15.300 --> 29:17.300
That doesn't sound right.

29:19.860 --> 29:21.860
Go on, then. Off you go.

29:38.020 --> 29:40.960
How many men have you
slept with since I left?

29:43.060 --> 29:45.060
None.

29:45.620 --> 29:48.090
~ Are you sure?
~ I think I'd remember.

29:49.620 --> 29:54.500
~ What about you?
~ Same.
~ Really?

29:56.540 --> 30:00.060
No sex with any men.

30:02.580 --> 30:04.580
And women?

30:05.580 --> 30:08.340
~ Do French girls count?
~ Cheeky bastard!

30:20.420 --> 30:22.420
I came back for you.

30:27.740 --> 30:29.810
What's gonna happen to us?

30:30.780 --> 30:33.180
~ What have you told them?
~ Nothing.

30:36.220 --> 30:39.020
You'd better be telling
the truth, Claire.

30:44.980 --> 30:47.180
Will you tie me up this time?

30:51.940 --> 30:54.210
How am I meant to get in there?

30:55.780 --> 30:58.780
~ I made a copy before I
handed the originals back.
~ No!

30:59.780 --> 31:04.260
You've read the files. You've
met Lee and Claire. Have a look
around and see what you think.

31:04.780 --> 31:06.780
What are YOU gonna do?

31:08.620 --> 31:12.340
~ Cate, please don't slam the door.
~ What do you want?

31:12.900 --> 31:14.900
Five minutes.

31:52.660 --> 31:55.980
I still haven't given
up on you or the case.

31:56.940 --> 32:00.140
Erm, I came because I thought
you should hear this from me.

32:02.460 --> 32:05.260
~ Lee Ashworth is back in the country.
~ Where?

32:05.780 --> 32:08.860
Nowhere near here. I'm keeping
him under observation.

32:10.020 --> 32:12.560
~ If I see him, I'll kill him.
~ I know.

32:18.860 --> 32:22.660
~ I was sorry to hear about you and Ricky.
~ It was a long time coming.

32:23.260 --> 32:26.820
~ Well, going through something like this...
~ We were broken before then.

32:27.620 --> 32:30.820
All that cock of the walk, "every
woman loves me" bullshit...

32:31.740 --> 32:34.140
Only so much any woman could take.

32:34.620 --> 32:39.580
Even over the fence, when he knew
I was watching, with Claire.

32:42.900 --> 32:44.900
He'd check I could see.

32:46.980 --> 32:52.300
~ I'm sorry, you never told us -
~ Even the moment his daughter
was being killed...
~ At the wedding?

32:53.140 --> 32:59.540
~ You were at the wedding together?
~ He was shagging one of the
bridesmaids - Tiffany Evans.

32:59.900 --> 33:05.380
~ You always said you were together
that night. You never mentioned -
~ What did it have to do with you?

33:05.940 --> 33:08.280
Makes no difference now, anyway.

33:10.940 --> 33:13.330
~ I will get you justice.
~ It's too late.

33:13.380 --> 33:15.380
It's not.

34:07.740 --> 34:12.010
~ Sorry, sorry! Got held up.
~ No, no, you're fine. We just
got here. This is Miller.

34:12.060 --> 34:14.060
~ Ellie.
~ Hi.

34:14.820 --> 34:18.900
~ Oh, sorry, I didn't realise that -
~ We work together. Worked together.

34:19.940 --> 34:23.219
~ Oh, you're Joe Miller's
wife. The Broadchurch case.
~ Right. Yep.

34:25.139 --> 34:28.540
~ I feel like I'm playing catch-up here.
~ It's about Sandbrook.

34:28.659 --> 34:32.610
~ Tell me that's not why you're here.
~ Hear me out. Lee Ashworth
is back in the country.

34:32.659 --> 34:36.290
~ He's staying near me. There's
grounds for reopening the case.
~ Don't do this.

34:36.340 --> 34:40.659
Potential new evidence - a pressed bluebell
sent to Claire Ripley anonymously.

34:41.739 --> 34:44.570
Plus, Miller, tell her what
she told you about that night.

34:44.620 --> 34:48.929
Claire said that, the night the girls went
missing, Lee drugged her with Rohypnol.

34:48.980 --> 34:51.850
She slept all night. When she woke
up, he was cleaning the place.

34:51.900 --> 34:55.380
~ So Claire Ripley's down there with you, too?
~ She's changed her story.

34:56.380 --> 35:00.690
~ Has she made a statement?
~ We were just talking.
~ Would she give a statement?
~ I haven't asked her.

35:00.740 --> 35:05.170
~ Couple of officers, that's
all I need. Some surveillance -
~ You're not even on active duty!

35:05.220 --> 35:08.970
Unless we have a genuinely significant
new lead, there's just no appetite to -

35:09.020 --> 35:11.610
~ At least talk to your superiors.
~ What is wrong with you?

35:11.660 --> 35:15.260
How can you imagine I'd want to go
back to it after what it did to us?

35:15.380 --> 35:18.250
~ Oh, God, you're his wife.
~ He didn't tell you?

35:19.260 --> 35:21.890
Huh! Of course he didn't.
Why am I even surprised?

35:21.940 --> 35:25.730
~ He said we were meeting the officer
who could reopen the case.
~ I could, but I won't.

35:25.780 --> 35:29.050
A girl's body is still missing.
A killer's walking free.

35:29.100 --> 35:32.810
There's families who don't have closure
and you won't reopen it because of what?

35:32.860 --> 35:36.250
Internal politics? Or...
or personal inconvenience?

35:36.300 --> 35:39.730
~ Don't take the moral high ground with me.
~ Me take the moral high ground?

35:39.780 --> 35:43.930
~ You built a bloody house there!
~ I see the families every month.
I write, phone and visit.

35:43.980 --> 35:46.290
~ I didn't run!
~ I had no choice. No-one stood up for me.

35:46.340 --> 35:49.660
~ Maybe you should've made more friends.
~ Like you and Dave (?)

35:52.660 --> 35:54.660
Right, I'm gonna leave.

35:56.140 --> 35:58.930
Don't be late for dinner. Daisy's
looking forward to it.

35:58.980 --> 36:01.780
Nice to meet you. Good
luck with the trial.

36:06.900 --> 36:08.900
Unbelievable.

36:11.300 --> 36:15.610
What I thought was, a charity to help kids
make that transition to secondary school.

36:15.660 --> 36:19.100
That time when they're growing up,
but really are still kids inside.

36:20.420 --> 36:23.160
That age when they
start keeping secrets.

36:23.220 --> 36:26.930
We could create packs, do a website
and set up a phone line.

36:26.980 --> 36:30.340
That's great, but there are
places that already do it.

36:31.300 --> 36:37.140
Look, Beth, to get funding for anything, in
this climate, you need a unique proposition.

36:37.500 --> 36:42.140
~ I'm sorry, petal.
~ Oh, I'm not gonna stop. There's
gonna be a charity in Danny's name.

36:42.500 --> 36:45.700
Well, the three of us were
talking before we got here

36:46.300 --> 36:53.140
and... there's a small group. They're new,
but they do the most challenging work.

36:53.420 --> 36:55.420
What sort of work?

36:57.820 --> 37:00.620
They work with known sex offenders.

37:01.460 --> 37:06.740
Those who've targeted children. They provide
support, to stop offenders reoffending.

37:07.380 --> 37:09.650
Rehabilitate for the long term.

37:09.940 --> 37:13.660
So Danny's legacy would be helping
the sort of man who murdered him?

37:14.660 --> 37:19.380
If you want to prevent children being targeted,
you stop the people targeting them.

37:20.300 --> 37:22.640
This is where the help's needed,

37:23.620 --> 37:26.700
because this is where most
people are too afraid to go.

37:27.820 --> 37:30.900
But you're different,
Beth. You're brave.

37:31.660 --> 37:33.660
I'm not.

37:34.260 --> 37:37.580
I can't do that. I'm
not that forgiving.

37:52.860 --> 37:55.860
~ You took your time!
~ You're lucky I'm here at all.

37:58.260 --> 38:03.460
~ How've you been?
~ How've I been? Are you kidding
me? I was in a cell because of you.

38:03.820 --> 38:05.820
You just left!

38:09.100 --> 38:11.100
I'm dying.

38:11.260 --> 38:13.260
What?

38:13.820 --> 38:16.820
Got cancer. They've
given me nine months.

38:18.980 --> 38:24.060
~ My lungs are done in.
~ No.... no, you're lying.

38:28.260 --> 38:31.780
~ Nice (!)
~ I don't believe a single word
that comes out your mouth.

38:32.060 --> 38:34.740
We got tangled up
in that boy's death.

38:36.580 --> 38:42.380
We don't have to carry on like that.
We can make peace, you and me.

38:44.060 --> 38:46.060
Why?

38:47.420 --> 38:50.220
Because you don't
turn on your family!

38:52.860 --> 38:54.860
I ain't your family.

39:12.620 --> 39:17.660
~ Have you got anything that isn't chicken?
~ There's spicy bean burger.
~ Oh, God, no.
~ Or a salad?

39:18.620 --> 39:22.140
~ Dad, it's a chicken joint.
~ I just don't really fancy it.
~ See?

39:22.900 --> 39:27.740
~ What?
~ Mum said you'd be fussy.
~ I'm not! Erm, just bring me
what they're having, thanks.

39:31.540 --> 39:34.260
~ So, how's school?
~ Pretty shit.

39:34.740 --> 39:37.330
~ Oh, we use words like that now, do we?
~ Don't look at me!

39:37.380 --> 39:39.650
I've been fighting this
for the past 18 months.

39:39.700 --> 39:43.500
~ Dad, "shit" is not swearing.
~ Erm, it is!
~ Ah, thank you. See?

39:43.700 --> 39:48.660
No, it's not! Look at you both. You
have no idea. I'm gonna get my drink.

39:53.020 --> 39:55.360
Oh, God, she's older, isn't she?

39:55.740 --> 39:58.740
Not just in days, but her manner
and the way she dresses...

39:58.900 --> 40:01.640
~ She's not a little girl any more.
~ Yeah...

40:03.460 --> 40:07.260
~ I missed her change.
~ Yes, you did.

40:10.060 --> 40:13.060
~ Let the case go, Alec.
~ You know I can't do that.

40:13.540 --> 40:15.610
Have you given him the
bollocking, or shall I?

40:15.660 --> 40:19.140
Ricky. Did you tell him I was here?

40:19.860 --> 40:23.570
Ricky called me earlier to lodge a complaint
of harassment against you and -

40:23.620 --> 40:26.980
You leave Cate alone.
She's too fragile.

40:28.500 --> 40:32.220
~ We all want the truth.
~ We had the truth and
you screwed it up for us.

40:34.420 --> 40:37.820
You're a failure! You
can never put it right.

40:41.380 --> 40:43.380
What's going on?

40:45.540 --> 40:47.540
Is this your girl?

40:49.220 --> 40:52.540
~ How old are you, sweetheart?
~ 15.
~ I had a girl like you.

40:55.540 --> 40:59.860
She was murdered... and, thanks
to your dad, a man's still free.

41:00.260 --> 41:02.260
All right.

41:06.020 --> 41:08.560
When you go this time, you stay gone.

41:11.500 --> 41:13.700
There's nothing for you here.

41:39.220 --> 41:42.370
I've just driven through the night
and you've not said a word.

41:42.420 --> 41:45.100
~ What's bothering you?
~ Ricky Gillespie.

41:46.300 --> 41:51.780
Why would a father not want an
investigation to restart into
the death of his own daughter?

41:52.460 --> 41:56.090
What if Lee Ashworth didn't do it?
What if he's been telling the truth?

41:56.140 --> 41:58.140
What if I've been wrong?

41:59.580 --> 42:02.850
Oh, my God, I meant to tell you.
When Claire and I went out drinking,

42:02.900 --> 42:05.900
~ I checked her phone - the one you gave her.
~ Yeah?

42:06.220 --> 42:10.860
Well, firstly, all the Internet searches are
about Lee: "Lee Ashworth killer". Bit odd.

42:12.540 --> 42:15.530
~ Second?
~ And she only had two numbers in her phone.

42:15.580 --> 42:17.970
First one was yours. The
other I didn't recognise.

42:18.020 --> 42:20.560
Oh, I've put it in my phone, hang on.

42:36.260 --> 42:38.330
No, it's just ringing out.

42:38.500 --> 42:40.640
Right, come on, we're late.

42:43.540 --> 42:47.140
~ You posted this this morning?
~ Yeah.
~ Without running it past me?

42:47.580 --> 42:51.330
~ Without even telling me?
~ It's online only. You said
I could post online only.

42:51.380 --> 42:56.060
~ You are getting above your station!
~ Hey, defence aren't calling Joe.
~ What? Why not?

42:59.300 --> 43:01.300
~ All rise!
~ I didn't know.

43:19.940 --> 43:22.210
The defence calls Susan Wright.

43:35.460 --> 43:37.860
(This is everything I could find.)

43:39.340 --> 43:42.440
Would you please give your
full name to the court?

43:42.940 --> 43:44.940
Susan Wright.

43:45.420 --> 43:51.020
And you were living at Tides
Caravan Park on July 18th 2013?

43:51.660 --> 43:56.130
~ I was.
~ Miss Wright, where were you in
the early hours of the morning...

43:56.180 --> 43:58.170
~ You all right, Jocelyn?
~ Yeah.

43:58.220 --> 44:03.340
~ .. 2013?
~ I was walking my dog Vince
on the beach at Broadchurch.

44:04.020 --> 44:06.020
I've a caravan nearby.

44:06.420 --> 44:09.460
And did you see anything significant
on the beach that morning?

44:10.340 --> 44:12.340
I saw a boat come in...

44:13.140 --> 44:16.080
.. and a man carrying
the body of a young boy.

44:20.100 --> 44:22.300
Then he laid it on the beach.

44:28.140 --> 44:31.080
'Did you recognise the
man carrying the body?'

44:31.980 --> 44:33.980
'Yeah, I did.'

44:34.380 --> 44:37.180
'And can you name that
man for the court?'

44:40.380 --> 44:46.100
Nigel Carter. He's my son...
and he's sitting over there.
