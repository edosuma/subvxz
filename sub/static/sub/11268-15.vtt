              Cold outside, huh?

00:15.015 --> 00:17.216
        Yes.                    

00:17.283 --> 00:20.185
              And we got a slush
                    thing going.

00:21.921 --> 00:24.089
So it seems.                    

00:25.558 --> 00:27.226
                    Beer nut?   

00:27.293 --> 00:28.961
No, thank you.                  

00:32.598 --> 00:35.934
              Have you ever been
              with an older man?

00:37.671 --> 00:40.072
Woody, I'm ready                
to settle up.                   

00:40.140 --> 00:42.941
                 I'm not looking
                 for commitment.

00:50.116 --> 00:53.419

02:07.927 --> 02:09.928
                 Paul, what time
                        you got?

02:09.996 --> 02:11.530
                        10:36.  

02:11.598 --> 02:13.198
                      All right,
                      lunchtime.

02:13.266 --> 02:16.335
                Wood... let's   
                  order, please.

02:16.403 --> 02:17.970
        Oh, okay,               
    what will you guys have?    

02:18.038 --> 02:20.973
  Chinese, subs, cheese steak,  
            Mexican?            

02:21.041 --> 02:22.408
            Mmm, sounds good.   

02:22.475 --> 02:24.109
      Mm-hmm.                   

02:24.177 --> 02:25.110
Now, wait a minute.             

02:25.178 --> 02:26.211
The lunch special upstairs      

02:26.279 --> 02:27.846
at Melville's today             
is crab salad.                  

02:27.914 --> 02:28.881
                        Yeah?   

02:28.948 --> 02:30.049
     Yeah. It's delicious.      

02:30.116 --> 02:31.917
      If you ask Mr. Hill       
      really, really nice,      

02:31.985 --> 02:34.019
    he'll give you your pick    
    of the leftovers.           

02:34.087 --> 02:35.888
                      Leftovers?

02:35.955 --> 02:37.489
            Woody, why don't you
                just go out back

02:37.557 --> 02:39.358
            and crawl through   
              the Dumpster, huh?

02:39.426 --> 02:40.559
What for?                       

02:40.627 --> 02:41.560
  All he throws back there is   

02:41.628 --> 02:43.529
     the food that clogs up     
        his drain.              

02:43.596 --> 02:46.098
        You know,               
  the, the greasy fried stuff.  

02:51.204 --> 02:52.838
                Don't even think
                    about it.   

02:52.906 --> 02:55.174
    You were thinking           
    the same thing.             

02:55.241 --> 02:56.809
                Yeah, but not   
                 as long as you.

02:56.876 --> 03:00.079
I have a problem, don't I?      

03:00.146 --> 03:02.715
      Well, what about you, Sam?
    You want some crab salad?   

03:02.782 --> 03:03.849
        From Melville's?        
        Forget it.              

03:03.917 --> 03:05.184
I hate that guy John Hill.      

03:05.251 --> 03:06.385
  I'd like to rip his head off  

03:06.453 --> 03:08.520
         and dribble it         
      down Beacon Street.       

03:08.588 --> 03:10.956
                    Well, forget
            the crab salad, Sam.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.991
 I think you could use something
      with a little fiber in it.

03:16.563 --> 03:19.531
Woody, I forbid you to eat      
        that man's food.        

03:19.599 --> 03:21.033
                 Well, Sam, it's
                a free lunch,   

03:21.101 --> 03:22.901
                    and you know
                how much I make.

03:22.969 --> 03:24.770
          I mean, I don't always
    have enough money for lunch,

03:24.838 --> 03:26.271
                    but I do get
                awful hungry.   

03:26.339 --> 03:27.740
                  And, remember,
                we had that talk

03:27.807 --> 03:30.642
        about the pretzels being
         just for the customers.

03:31.945 --> 03:33.846
    Oh, go on, go on,           
        get out of here.        

03:33.913 --> 03:36.715
Go eat your stupid salad.       

03:36.783 --> 03:40.319
Sam, just how much              
do you pay that boy?            

03:40.387 --> 03:42.621
                    I pay him   
                  a fair amount.

03:42.689 --> 03:44.156
        See, Fras, I don't think
                  you understand

03:44.224 --> 03:46.058
        that a, a bartender's   
                  hourly wage is

03:46.126 --> 03:49.828
    just a very small portion   
          of his overall income.

03:49.896 --> 03:53.532
                Most of it comes
                      from <i>tips.</i>

03:55.135 --> 03:56.535
          I see.                

03:58.038 --> 04:00.706
I won't bring it up again, Sam. 

04:00.774 --> 04:03.308
         I think that'd be best.

04:03.376 --> 04:05.544
        Hey, everybody,         
        shut your yaps.         

04:05.612 --> 04:07.980
        My son has a big        
     announcement to make.      

04:08.048 --> 04:09.481
    Okay, go on, Gino,          
        tell them               

04:09.549 --> 04:11.383
        what you told me        
    before in the car.          

04:11.451 --> 04:14.053
I said, "Ma, I think            
I want to be a priest."         

04:14.120 --> 04:16.188
    Did you hear that?          
      Did you hear that?!       

04:16.255 --> 04:18.589
     My kid is going to be      
        a priest.               

04:18.658 --> 04:21.527
        Finally, when I visit   
    one of my kids on Sunday,   

04:21.594 --> 04:26.065
         there's not going to be
    an inch of glass between us.

04:26.132 --> 04:27.766
          Well, congratulations,
                        Gino.   

04:27.834 --> 04:29.234
              I'm happy for you.

04:29.302 --> 04:31.036
                  Happy for him?
         That's not enough, Sam.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.604
                      This calls
                     for a beer.

04:32.672 --> 04:34.440
              Come on, the guy's
                 underage, Norm.

04:34.507 --> 04:35.741
        Oh, it's not for him.   

04:35.809 --> 04:37.609
                Can't I be happy
                    for the lad?

04:37.677 --> 04:38.911
    Gino, here you go.          

04:38.978 --> 04:40.212
    I want to give you          
      a little money here.      

04:40.280 --> 04:41.513
     I want you to go out,      

04:41.581 --> 04:43.182
          buy yourself          
    some nice clothes, okay?    

04:43.249 --> 04:45.484
    I don't want God to think   
     he's getting himself a bum.

04:45.552 --> 04:47.086
Thanks, Ma.                     

04:47.153 --> 04:48.287
                Congratulations,
                        Gino.   

04:48.355 --> 04:49.888
        I think it's terrific   
                when a young man

04:49.956 --> 04:51.523
             like yourself finds
                    his calling.

04:51.591 --> 04:53.025
              I'm happy for you.

04:53.093 --> 04:55.094
Oh, yeah?                       
How happy?                      

04:55.161 --> 04:56.328
Why don't you, uh, show me?     

04:59.866 --> 05:02.334
    You know that if you have   
  a kid who's a priest or a nun,

05:02.402 --> 05:04.236
    you automatically           
        get into Heaven.        

05:04.304 --> 05:06.271
      No questions asked.       

05:06.339 --> 05:07.506
                        PAUL:   
                    Can I get   
                  a beer, Carla?

05:08.641 --> 05:10.776
Ah. Paul, Paul...               

05:10.844 --> 05:13.112
    There!                      

05:13.179 --> 05:14.513
    (laughs)                    

05:15.849 --> 05:17.416
    Isn't this great?           

05:17.484 --> 05:21.854
  Right now, God is shrugging   
  and saying, "What can I do?"  

05:24.791 --> 05:26.291
        Hey, everybody.         

05:26.359 --> 05:28.160
You'll all be very              
happy to know                   

05:28.228 --> 05:30.729
that I am now a, uh,            
published humorist.             

05:30.797 --> 05:32.931
            Wow. The <i>Post Office</i>
                     <i>Newsletter.</i>

05:32.999 --> 05:34.600
             I hear that's tough
                    to get into.

05:34.668 --> 05:37.736
Oh, yeah, I'll say.             

05:37.804 --> 05:40.539
Yeah, they've been after me     
for quite some time now,        

05:40.607 --> 05:42.007
and I finally gave them         
permission to,                  

05:42.075 --> 05:45.244
uh, print one                   
of my "daffynitions."           

05:45.311 --> 05:47.546
                      All right,
                  let's hear it.
    (others groan)              

05:47.614 --> 05:49.214
          What? Hey, hey, he was
          going to do it anyway.

05:49.282 --> 05:52.651
                Don't make me   
            the bad guy here.   

05:52.719 --> 05:54.853
Here you go, uh...              
Daffynition,

05:59.225 --> 06:01.427
                      (chuckles)

06:01.494 --> 06:03.228
    Now, Lilith, you, uh, you   
         thought that was funny?

06:03.296 --> 06:04.863
LILITH:                         
Oh, yes.                        

06:04.931 --> 06:07.733
              You should see her
      at a Marx Brothers' movie.

06:08.935 --> 06:10.703
                     Isn't Zeppo
                     hysterical?

06:10.770 --> 06:12.905
                 The way he just
                    stands there

06:12.972 --> 06:14.773
              without expression
                    or reaction.

06:14.841 --> 06:17.443
                    Boy, that   
                cracks me up.   

06:17.510 --> 06:19.778
You guys are really missing out.

06:19.846 --> 06:21.347
  This crab salad looks great.  

06:21.414 --> 06:23.015
                      All right.
                Where's ours?   

06:23.083 --> 06:24.783
    Well, I thought you said    
      you didn't want any.      

06:24.851 --> 06:26.352
 I don't remember saying that.  
         Do you, Norm?          

06:26.419 --> 06:28.854
                    I never said
                that in my life.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.089
Come on. I thought you guys     

06:30.156 --> 06:31.223
were going to order             
something else.                 

06:31.291 --> 06:32.458
                Well, we didn't,
                          Woody.

06:32.525 --> 06:33.759
              It's nearly 11:00.

06:33.827 --> 06:36.595
                     I'm getting
                 a little dizzy.

06:36.663 --> 06:38.497
                  That does look
                kind of good.   

06:38.565 --> 06:41.433
Aah, I can't give               
you guys my food every day.     

06:41.501 --> 06:42.868
                     Woody, it's
                  not every day.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.670
        It's just on days I'm   
      particularly hungry, okay?

06:44.738 --> 06:46.338
Don't bite my head off.         
    I mean it.                  

06:46.406 --> 06:48.540
You know, you've got            
that look in your eye.          

06:48.608 --> 06:50.509
        Ow... Oh! Aah...        

06:50.577 --> 06:51.844
What's wrong, Sam?              

06:51.911 --> 06:53.278
 Oh, I think I broke my tooth.  

06:53.346 --> 06:54.880
        I don't believe that.   

06:54.948 --> 06:56.715
                 There's a shell
                  in this salad.

06:56.783 --> 06:58.517
            I'm going to sue him
      for everything he's worth.

06:58.585 --> 07:01.420
Oh, great! Just when            
I get a little ahead            

07:01.488 --> 07:04.356
in my checking account.         

07:04.424 --> 07:06.792
          Not you, Woody-- Hill.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.427
                Ooh, you know   
                      something?

07:08.495 --> 07:10.529
     I am going to sue him.     

07:10.597 --> 07:13.632
    Oh, yes! Oh, yes,           
and I'm going to win, too.      

07:13.700 --> 07:16.468
      Here's to me!             
                      All right.

07:16.536 --> 07:18.437
                      (grunting)

07:25.278 --> 07:26.612
                      Hey, Becs,
                 what you doing?

07:26.680 --> 07:28.080
        Well, I'm trying        
  to get these receipts ready   

07:28.148 --> 07:29.715
            for income tax time.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.417
                 Man, I wish you
         people would just write

07:31.484 --> 07:32.851
                    the dates   
                on these things.

07:32.919 --> 07:34.753
              Half of them I had
              to cross-reference

07:34.821 --> 07:36.121
                         against
              the register tape.

07:36.189 --> 07:38.824
    It took me half the night   
         to get these organized.

07:38.892 --> 07:39.958
Gee, up all night.              

07:40.026 --> 07:41.727
You could catch a chill.        

07:41.795 --> 07:43.062
Here, let me warm you up.       

07:43.129 --> 07:45.230
                      No! Don't!

07:45.298 --> 07:47.599
                        Stop it!

07:49.436 --> 07:51.003
                You are evil!   

07:51.071 --> 07:53.072
That's right, all day long.     

07:53.139 --> 07:55.841
And it doesn't matter,          
because my son is good,         

07:55.909 --> 07:58.310
and I've got myself             
a get-out-of-Hell-free card.    

08:00.847 --> 08:02.214
         You know, uh,          

08:02.282 --> 08:04.750
I've been thinking about Carla's
      son becoming priest.      

08:04.818 --> 08:06.552
Get this, "My son, the father." 

08:06.619 --> 08:09.288
            Get it?             
     "My son, the father."      

08:09.356 --> 08:12.291
That's a rich comedy area,      
        I'm telling you.        

08:12.359 --> 08:14.960
Lord help me, I miss            
the "daffynitions."             

08:15.028 --> 08:18.163
 Oh, hey, do I hear a request?  

08:18.231 --> 08:20.366
Okay. Daffynition.              
Psychiatrist:                   

08:20.433 --> 08:24.636
  a guy who shrinks your head   
     and your bank account.     

08:24.704 --> 08:26.905
                    (chuckling):
                        Ouch.   

08:26.973 --> 08:28.407
            Yeah...             

08:28.475 --> 08:30.442
                     Bull's-eye.

08:30.510 --> 08:31.944
                        NORM:   
        Yeah, well, you know,   

08:32.011 --> 08:35.114
  I've got enough material for  
 an entire stand-up comedy act. 

08:35.181 --> 08:36.515
          Okay, all right, uh...

08:36.582 --> 08:38.917
    Why is it that women go     
         to a "stylist"         

08:38.985 --> 08:40.753
     and men go to barbers?     

08:40.820 --> 08:42.321
      What's up with that?      

08:42.389 --> 08:46.158
                     (chuckles):
                 That's so true.

08:48.361 --> 08:49.695
I got an impersonation for you. 

08:49.763 --> 08:51.597
     An impression, ready?      

08:53.667 --> 08:55.067
         I am not a crook.      

08:55.135 --> 08:56.869
                      (chuckles)

09:01.107 --> 09:04.476
Well, you guys know me.         
Home to see Vera.               

09:06.646 --> 09:08.213
    I want to go, too, Norm.    

09:08.281 --> 09:10.582
I, I heard so many good things. 

09:10.650 --> 09:13.519
Oh, please don't leave me.      

09:13.586 --> 09:14.720
     Yeah, you know, I was,     
          uh, watching          

09:14.788 --> 09:16.755
     this commercial on TV      
     with the Ginsu knives.     

09:16.823 --> 09:18.590
Hey, what's up with that?       

09:18.658 --> 09:21.160
                     (chuckles):
         I hate that commercial.

09:21.227 --> 09:23.228
             This is good stuff.

09:24.497 --> 09:27.499
          You know, she can also
             hear a dog-whistle.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.168
                        NORM:   
                You know, uh,   

09:29.235 --> 09:30.536
you know,                       
all my life I've, uh,           

09:30.603 --> 09:33.339
kind of wanted to be            
a stand-up comedian.            

09:33.406 --> 09:34.573
You know, uh, oh,               
here, here it is.               

09:34.641 --> 09:35.607
How's this for an idea?         

09:35.675 --> 09:37.976
Comedy night at Cheers.         

09:38.044 --> 09:40.646
Seven nights a week,            
six shows a night.              

09:42.449 --> 09:45.951
The cock-eyed mind              
of Cliff Clavin.                

09:46.019 --> 09:47.686
    So you're saying it'd be    
just like any other night       

09:47.754 --> 09:48.954
      except for the mike?      

09:49.022 --> 09:50.189
                        NORM:   
                     Yeah, yeah!

09:50.256 --> 09:52.257
     Hey, hey, what to you      
     say there, Becs? Huh?      

09:52.359 --> 09:54.727
Well, I guess you could do      
    your comedy here, Cliff.    

09:54.794 --> 09:55.894
But you know what?              

09:55.962 --> 09:57.096
I mean, wouldn't                
you rather do it                

09:57.163 --> 09:58.097
at a professional               
comedy club?                    

09:58.164 --> 09:59.832
              Huh?              
You know,                       
the Laugh Tureen                

09:59.899 --> 10:01.100
     in Kenmore Square has      
      an open mike night.       

10:01.167 --> 10:02.434
                    Oh, yeah.   

10:02.502 --> 10:03.736
      As a matter of fact,      
     I think it's tonight.      

10:03.803 --> 10:05.871
             Hey, that's a great
                  idea, Rebecca.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.706
            I'll just, uh, yeah,
             spend the afternoon

10:07.774 --> 10:10.509
        polishing up my act and,
  uh, showcase it there tonight.

10:10.577 --> 10:12.444
  Oh, why waste all this stuff  
          on you guys?          

10:12.512 --> 10:14.213
See you later.                  

10:15.849 --> 10:19.051
      And you people think      
         I'm so stupid.         

10:26.726 --> 10:29.428
 Sam, did you see your dentist? 
 Did you get your tooth fixed?  

10:29.496 --> 10:32.064
        (lisping):              
      Yeth... Good as new.      

10:32.132 --> 10:34.433
                  They shoot you
            full of Novocain?   

10:34.501 --> 10:37.770
        Yeth, they did.         
     It's all worn off now.     

10:37.837 --> 10:39.705
     All right, there now.      

10:39.773 --> 10:41.173
    There's all my receipts.    

10:41.241 --> 10:43.042
                  Now I'm ready.

10:45.412 --> 10:47.112
     Where's my calculator?     

10:47.180 --> 10:49.181
Oh, oh, here it is.             

10:49.249 --> 10:51.283
I was just washing              
it off for you.                 

10:51.351 --> 10:53.952
                      (gasps)   
    Here you go.                

10:54.020 --> 10:57.222
Come on, just plug it in        
and start tapping away.         

10:58.525 --> 11:01.326
         Carla, this is, this is
        an expensive calculator.

11:01.394 --> 11:02.594
Oh, yeah.                       

11:02.662 --> 11:05.164
I'm probably going to rot       
in Hell for that.               

11:05.231 --> 11:06.665
      Not!                      

11:10.437 --> 11:13.439
    Ah, Miss Tortelli,          
     nice to see you again.     

11:13.506 --> 11:15.474
            What're you doing   
                down here, Hill?

11:15.542 --> 11:17.810
            Hope you're not here
        to ask me for a date.   

11:17.877 --> 11:18.811
             Date?              

11:18.878 --> 11:20.212
Is that what you call it?       

11:20.280 --> 11:22.681
I think we skipped dating,      
Miss Tortelli,                  

11:22.749 --> 11:25.184
    and went straight           
      to the fall of Rome.      

11:25.251 --> 11:27.052
    Tell me,                    

11:27.120 --> 11:29.388
is the rumor true your son's    
going to be a priest?           

11:29.456 --> 11:30.856
    Yeah, what of it?           

11:30.924 --> 11:33.025
Well, I didn't realize          
you were Catholic.              

11:33.093 --> 11:34.593
The only time                   
I've heard you say              

11:34.661 --> 11:36.161
anything remotely               
religious                       

11:36.229 --> 11:37.996
was that night                  
a few weeks ago                 

11:38.064 --> 11:41.000
when you called me              
Zeus.                           

11:45.605 --> 11:47.339
                 The hell I did.

11:47.407 --> 11:50.109
You want me to run              
the videotape?                  

11:54.881 --> 11:56.815
      Ah, Hill.                 

11:56.883 --> 11:58.817
             Uh, Sam, you wanted
                      to see me?

11:58.885 --> 12:00.819
          <i>Yeth,</i> I did.          

12:02.255 --> 12:04.523
What do you think               
that is?                        

12:04.591 --> 12:07.359
Well, it looks like some kind   
        of animal tooth, Sam.   

12:07.427 --> 12:09.495
    Is my tooth.                

12:09.562 --> 12:11.663
        I broke it              
         on your salad.         

12:11.731 --> 12:14.500
     And I want you to know     
    I will see you in court.    

12:14.567 --> 12:16.335
                        Oh.     
    Yeah.                       

12:16.403 --> 12:18.337
              Good heavens, this
                 is frightening.

12:18.405 --> 12:19.672
                 I'm being sued.

12:19.739 --> 12:22.908
                  By Elmer Fudd.

12:24.010 --> 12:25.411
                    Listen, Sam,

12:25.478 --> 12:27.579
          I don't recall selling
             you any crab salad.

12:27.647 --> 12:29.581
              And I don't recall
                    you being in
                  my restaurant.

12:29.649 --> 12:32.618
        What I do remember is   
            that I gave Woody   
                 some leftovers,

12:32.686 --> 12:34.620
            and you can't sue   
                    me for that.

12:34.688 --> 12:38.223
              Incidentally, Sam,
                you're drooling.

12:40.527 --> 12:43.529
That guy dwives me cwazy.       

12:43.596 --> 12:45.731
         Oh, oh, Becs,          

12:45.799 --> 12:46.765
there you are.                  

12:46.833 --> 12:48.300
They just called                
for you.                        

12:48.368 --> 12:51.403
Apparently, there's been a      
horrible fire at your apartment.

12:51.471 --> 12:52.738
            Oh, right, Carla,   

12:52.806 --> 12:54.373
    you've been trying to get   
             to me all day long.

12:54.441 --> 12:55.974
         Just knock it off. It's
         not even funny anymore.

12:56.042 --> 12:57.976
I'm being totally               
serious.                        

12:58.044 --> 12:59.978
I know this is                  
the worst time                  

13:00.046 --> 13:02.047
for you to hear this kind       
of news from me.                

13:02.115 --> 13:03.482
I know you don't                
believe me, but,                

13:03.550 --> 13:04.950
really, I'm telling             
the truth.                      

13:05.018 --> 13:07.386
I wouldn't joke about           
something like that.            

13:07.454 --> 13:09.455
            You're serious about
            this, aren't you?   

13:09.522 --> 13:11.190
Yeah, I am, Becs.               
I'm sorry.                      

13:11.257 --> 13:13.225
                     Oh, my God!

13:13.293 --> 13:15.227
            Everything I own.   

13:15.295 --> 13:16.895
                      It's gone!

13:16.963 --> 13:18.063
                    Oh, dear!   

13:18.131 --> 13:19.965
  Woody, cover for me, please.  

13:20.033 --> 13:21.300
I got to go out.                

13:21.368 --> 13:22.668
        (crying):               
I'm too upset, Miss Howe.       

13:22.736 --> 13:26.105
I just found out my whole       
apartment building burned down. 

13:28.108 --> 13:30.142
     (laughing maniacally)      

13:30.210 --> 13:32.745
         This is sick!          

13:32.812 --> 13:35.180
     Yeah, but it's funny.      

13:35.248 --> 13:38.851
Carla, you have, you have       
to stop this now.               

13:38.918 --> 13:39.918
                Or what?        

13:39.986 --> 13:42.254
                 God'll smite me
                 with his sword?

13:42.322 --> 13:43.922
         He gets it halfway out,

13:43.990 --> 13:45.824
                an angel taps   
             him on his shoulder

13:45.892 --> 13:48.327
      and says, "Hold it,       
      her kid's a priest."      

13:48.395 --> 13:50.763
 God just stands there fuming.  

13:52.032 --> 13:54.066
     Hey, Ma, check it out.     

13:55.235 --> 13:57.136
          Gino, what,           
     what are you wearing?      

13:57.203 --> 13:59.405
Isn't that a little flashy      
         for a priest?          

13:59.472 --> 14:00.572
Oh, no, a priest.               

14:00.640 --> 14:01.707
That was                        
this morning.                   

14:01.775 --> 14:03.042
I'm gonna                       
be a male model.                

14:03.109 --> 14:05.377
I figured why waste these       
looks on the church?            

14:05.445 --> 14:08.380
    (thunder rumbling)          

14:10.950 --> 14:12.985
             Uh-oh.             

14:25.732 --> 14:27.633
          (whimpering)          

14:27.701 --> 14:29.668
        I'm sorry.              

14:29.736 --> 14:32.671
         I'm so sorry.          

14:32.739 --> 14:34.673
 Carla, you've been leaping out 
          of your skin          

14:34.741 --> 14:36.408
every time there's a clap       
          of thunder.           

14:36.476 --> 14:38.577
     Surely you know it's simply
              static electricity

14:38.645 --> 14:40.346
        being discharged into   
                 the atmosphere.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.915
    You are so naive!           

14:42.982 --> 14:45.150
Carla, you've got to calm down. 

14:45.218 --> 14:46.552
                          CARLA:
            You don't get it!   

14:46.619 --> 14:48.320
         I mocked God!          

14:48.388 --> 14:50.589
  And this is not like getting  
  in trouble with your parents  

14:50.657 --> 14:52.291
 or your teachers or your boss. 

14:52.359 --> 14:53.592
      I mean, this is God!      

14:53.660 --> 14:54.760
Famine, flood,                  

14:54.828 --> 14:56.695
      pestilence, disease.      

14:56.763 --> 14:58.430
    Who do you think came up    
        with that?              

14:58.498 --> 14:59.631
    (thunder rumbling)          

14:59.699 --> 15:01.700
            (moans)             

15:01.768 --> 15:04.737
 He is just toying with me now. 

15:06.106 --> 15:07.172
    Carla, you can't believe    

15:07.240 --> 15:09.208
that God has a personal vendetta
          against you.          

15:09.275 --> 15:10.342
        Look at my kids.        

15:10.410 --> 15:11.610
      Look at my husbands.      

15:11.678 --> 15:12.678
        Look at my life.        

15:12.746 --> 15:14.346
    What do you think?          

15:15.915 --> 15:18.183
Uh, I don't think               
any major religion              

15:18.251 --> 15:21.253
still propounds the theory      
of a vindictive God,            

15:21.321 --> 15:22.788
     who hurls thunderbolts     

15:22.856 --> 15:25.691
  and takes personal vengeance  
  on people's transgressions.   

15:25.759 --> 15:27.593
    (thunder roaring)           

15:28.962 --> 15:31.296
I believe that's for you.       

15:31.364 --> 15:32.564
             Okay.              

15:32.632 --> 15:35.634
        Okay, I got it.         

15:35.702 --> 15:37.636
      Starting right now,       

15:37.704 --> 15:40.439
I'm gonna lead the perfect life.

15:40.507 --> 15:43.475
    I'm gonna be good.          

15:43.543 --> 15:45.811
         Gonna be nice.         

15:45.879 --> 15:48.881
          From now on,          
     I'm going to be nice.      

15:48.948 --> 15:50.616
         Carla, would you please
              serve table seven?

15:50.684 --> 15:52.584
                     Shut up!   

15:52.652 --> 15:55.320
        So far, so good.        

15:55.388 --> 15:58.323
        You know, Carla never   
             ceases to amaze me.

15:58.391 --> 16:01.326
            She has a strange   
              mixture of fervent
                 religious faith

16:01.394 --> 16:03.762
                and primitive   
                superstition.   

16:03.830 --> 16:05.597
                  I suppose it's
                        a result

16:05.665 --> 16:08.634
        of our ever-changing,   
            mixed-up culture.   

16:08.702 --> 16:11.003
I don't know                    
that you should blame           

16:11.071 --> 16:13.772
Carla's belief system           
on culture, Frasier.            

16:13.840 --> 16:16.775
The need to worship higher      
intelligence is an innate       

16:16.843 --> 16:18.777
and universal                   
phenomenon.                     

16:18.845 --> 16:21.113
In fact,                        
in recent weeks,                

16:21.181 --> 16:24.416
it's become clear               
that my lab rats worship me     

16:24.484 --> 16:27.152
as a goddess.                   

16:28.755 --> 16:30.656
I must confess,                 

16:30.724 --> 16:32.658
I don't discourage them.        

16:34.728 --> 16:36.662
                     That's very
              interesting, dear.

16:36.730 --> 16:39.665
                      Apropos of
                    nothing, uh,

16:39.733 --> 16:42.668
          how many vacation days
             do you have coming?

16:42.736 --> 16:44.003
I don't know.                   

16:44.070 --> 16:46.438
Uh... 80, 85.                   

16:48.541 --> 16:52.478
            Well, what do you   
                 say we cash 50,

16:52.545 --> 16:55.280
         60 of those in and have
         you spend a little time

16:55.348 --> 16:57.449
        with, uh, some, oh...   

16:57.517 --> 16:59.818
                I don't know,   
                    some people?

17:04.624 --> 17:06.692
    Sam, where have you been    
         all afternoon?         

17:06.760 --> 17:08.694
 Oh, just pacing back and forth 
         with my sign,          

17:08.762 --> 17:10.295
 ruining John Hill's business.  

17:10.363 --> 17:11.763
     I saw him peeking out      
          the window.           

17:11.830 --> 17:13.398
    I think he's ready          
        to make a deal.         

17:13.465 --> 17:14.833
 How do you like my sign, huh?  

17:14.901 --> 17:17.169
                "I broke a tooth
                  at Melville's.

17:17.237 --> 17:19.137
                    Ask me how."

17:21.107 --> 17:22.508
             That's a very scary
                little spider   

17:22.575 --> 17:23.842
            holding the tooth   
                     there, Sam.

17:23.910 --> 17:27.346
That's, uh,                     
that's a crab actually.         

17:30.684 --> 17:32.384
                         Crab.  

17:32.452 --> 17:34.053
Well, looks like a spider.      

17:34.120 --> 17:35.421
You know, a lot                 
of people said that,            

17:35.488 --> 17:36.889
so I ended up                   
changing the story.             

17:36.956 --> 17:38.524
I told 'em, that                
there was this outbreak         

17:38.591 --> 17:40.359
    of poisonous spiders up     
         at Melville's.         

17:40.427 --> 17:42.061
 It scared the hell out of 'em. 

17:44.564 --> 17:46.265
              Sam?              

17:46.332 --> 17:47.533
         Stay for this.         
      This should be fun.       

17:47.600 --> 17:49.001
                      Yes, John?

17:49.069 --> 17:50.669
Let's get down                  
to brass tacks, Sam.            

17:50.737 --> 17:52.671
Absurd as it may sound,         

17:52.739 --> 17:54.039
you and your scary spider...    

17:54.107 --> 17:55.374
            That's a crab. Crab.

17:55.442 --> 17:56.608
Forgive me.                     

17:56.676 --> 17:59.078
You and your scary crab         

17:59.145 --> 18:01.080
are driving                     
my customers away,              

18:01.147 --> 18:02.581
so let's settle this            
right now.                      

18:02.649 --> 18:04.917
I'll pay for your dental        
bill and add,                   

18:04.984 --> 18:07.319
say, uh, $500 in cash.          

18:09.422 --> 18:11.357
                    It's a deal.

18:11.424 --> 18:12.991
                      (chuckles)

18:14.361 --> 18:17.529
(coughing)                      

18:17.597 --> 18:19.865
             You all right, man?

18:19.933 --> 18:22.034
There's a rock                  
in your pretzel dish, Sam.      

18:22.102 --> 18:23.502
That is deliberate              
negligence.                     

18:23.570 --> 18:24.937
         Oh, it is not!         

18:25.005 --> 18:27.239
         Come on, man,          
    you put that there. I...    

18:27.307 --> 18:29.875
                          Wha...

18:33.146 --> 18:35.781
A picture is worth              
a thousand words, Sam.          

18:44.290 --> 18:45.758
        (applause)              
        Thank you.              

18:45.825 --> 18:47.926
Uh, now for the final performer 
         this evening,          

18:47.994 --> 18:50.763
  let's put our hands together  
     for the merry mailman,     

18:50.830 --> 18:53.265
         Cliff Clavin.          

18:53.333 --> 18:54.933
Come on,                        
put 'em together.               

18:55.001 --> 18:56.935
              Hey.              
Oh, yeah, thanks.               

18:59.005 --> 19:01.206
        Uh, hi ya!              

19:01.274 --> 19:03.275
            So, uh,             

19:03.343 --> 19:06.111
    Boston audiences are the    
greatest audiences in the world.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.151
         Uh, you know,          
     I got this friend, uh,     

19:12.218 --> 19:14.219
    whose son is gonna          
        become a priest.        

19:14.287 --> 19:15.954
  I know where this is going.   

19:16.022 --> 19:18.090
     "My son, the father."      

19:18.158 --> 19:20.259
      What's up with that?      

19:22.562 --> 19:24.630
I never thought I'd see         
a whole roomful of people       

19:24.698 --> 19:26.665
not laughing at Cliff.          

19:26.733 --> 19:30.402
Well, hey, let's see what topics
we got in the ol' mailbag, huh? 

19:30.470 --> 19:33.739
    Hey, oh, uh, here's one.    

19:33.807 --> 19:37.509
Uh, anybody have a chance       
 to call a TV repairman lately? 

19:37.577 --> 19:41.313
      What's up with that?      

19:41.381 --> 19:43.982
(chuckles)                      
Here's a doozy.                 

19:44.050 --> 19:46.485
    Avon lady... ding dong.     

19:46.553 --> 19:49.254
      What's up with that?      

19:50.357 --> 19:52.958
                    Well, that's
                      it for me.

19:54.094 --> 19:56.795
Well, I know, uh,               

19:56.863 --> 19:58.831
    seriously, folks,           
      on-on a serious note      

19:58.898 --> 20:00.833
     I just want to say...      

20:00.900 --> 20:03.836
     drinking and driving.      

20:05.305 --> 20:07.272
      What's up with that?      

20:07.340 --> 20:09.975
      Thank you very much,      
     ladies and gentlemen.      

20:10.043 --> 20:11.210
  I've really enjoyed it, uh,   

20:11.277 --> 20:13.078
        and I gotta say         
     this is the most love      

20:13.146 --> 20:14.747
I've ever felt in one room      
          in my life.           

20:14.814 --> 20:16.148
     Thank you. Thank you.      

20:23.523 --> 20:25.491
Normie, where'd                 
everybody go?                   

20:26.559 --> 20:29.495
                There was a, uh,
                     bomb scare.

20:30.897 --> 20:31.897
    Really?                     

20:31.965 --> 20:32.998
        Where?                  

20:33.066 --> 20:34.800
          Right about           
    where you were standing.    

20:44.878 --> 20:46.412
     Oh, hey, Cliff.            

20:46.479 --> 20:48.080
    How'd it go at the club?    

20:48.148 --> 20:49.415
          Daffynition.          

20:49.482 --> 20:52.384
 Cliff Clavin: Stand-up comic.  

20:52.452 --> 20:54.486
                      (laughs)  

20:54.554 --> 20:56.155
It's not a joke,                
Lilith.                         

20:56.222 --> 20:57.890
That was my pain.               
                        (laughs)

20:57.957 --> 20:59.525
                 Oh, the topper.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.360
                      Excuse me,

21:01.428 --> 21:03.362
                    I have to go
                 compose myself.

21:05.598 --> 21:08.200
Well, Cliff, I guess you had    
to learn the hard way.          

21:08.268 --> 21:10.469
But you know,                   
maybe stand-up comedy           

21:10.537 --> 21:12.504
is just something               
you don't have a knack for.     

21:12.572 --> 21:13.605
                     Yeah.      

21:13.673 --> 21:14.673
                I don't know.   

21:14.741 --> 21:16.342
              I can't figure out
                what went wrong.

21:16.409 --> 21:18.010
            I mean, the material
                was gangbusters.

21:18.078 --> 21:19.078
              I wrote it myself.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.047
                  Must have been
                the audience.   

21:23.583 --> 21:25.384
            What's up with that?

21:25.452 --> 21:26.418
                    (chuckling):
                            See?

21:26.486 --> 21:28.087
                 I still got it.

21:31.391 --> 21:33.559
Carla, doesn't                  
that hurt?                      

21:33.626 --> 21:35.594
                     Yeah, but I
                     deserve it.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.563
                    I'm atoning.

21:37.630 --> 21:40.399
            I thought of walking
                on hot coals,   

21:40.467 --> 21:42.835
    and I thought of sleeping   
              on a bed of nails,

21:42.902 --> 21:46.372
          but nothing I think of
              seems like enough.

21:46.439 --> 21:49.341
I just got to think of some way 
to punish myself                

21:49.409 --> 21:52.644
  that no human being has ever  
          done before.          

21:52.712 --> 21:54.813
                  Oh, hey, I got
                    it, Becs.   

21:54.881 --> 21:57.783
             All I have to do is
                find somebody to
            sit down with me,   

21:57.851 --> 22:00.252
    you know, like a personal   
              audience, and I'll
             go over my routine,

22:00.320 --> 22:01.487
                  you know, over
                 and over again,

22:01.554 --> 22:04.323
        a hundred times or so   
        until I nail it down.   

22:04.391 --> 22:05.424
                      Huh?      

22:05.492 --> 22:07.426
                 Any volunteers?

22:15.135 --> 22:17.770
You really play hardball,       
        don't you?
