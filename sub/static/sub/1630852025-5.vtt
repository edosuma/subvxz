02:54.165 --> 02:57.259
We're interested in
advancing the ball on this, uh,

02:57.418 --> 03:00.512
somewhat unique situation here,
ten-foot cans this year.

03:00.597 --> 03:04.424
- Yes.
- MARTY: So, we are reenergized about the whole thing.

03:04.517 --> 03:07.427
<i>This is substantially more.
It's almost double.</i>

03:07.511 --> 03:09.771
IRVING: Bill, why don't you,
uh, kick your things off here

03:09.856 --> 03:11.940
- and let 'em know what our game plan is.
<i>- Yeah, sure.</i>

03:12.025 --> 03:13.934
So, we've been working
really closely here

03:14.027 --> 03:15.602
with, uh, Vanessa over at ROC

03:15.695 --> 03:18.688
<i>to make sure that we've got
all the equipment lined up</i>

<i>NARRATOR:
Over the past month,</i>

03:27.782 --> 03:31.210
<i>the Oak Island team has made
astonishing discoveries</i>

03:31.369 --> 03:33.712
<i>in a number of boreholes
across their grid system</i>

03:33.871 --> 03:37.457
<i>near the four-foot-wide shaft
known as C-1,</i>

03:37.541 --> 03:42.879
<i>which was first dug to a depth
of 171 feet six years ago.</i>

03:42.972 --> 03:45.807
<i>These finds include
water samples</i>

03:45.967 --> 03:49.144
<i>containing trace evidence
of both silver and gold,</i>

03:49.303 --> 03:54.316
<i>and at a depth of some 90 feet,
metal fragments containing gold.</i>

03:54.400 --> 03:56.985
<i>As well as evidence
of wooden tunnels</i>

03:57.144 --> 04:01.147
<i>that have been carbon-dated
to as early as 1488.</i>

04:01.241 --> 04:04.660
<i>Now, as Rick, Marty,
Craig and the team</i>

04:04.819 --> 04:06.987
<i>conclude the final weeks</i>

04:07.071 --> 04:09.572
<i>of their drilling program
in the Money Pit,</i>

04:09.657 --> 04:12.826
<i>they are ready to begin planning
phase two of this year's quest,</i>

04:12.910 --> 04:16.505
<i>which entails digging a number
of ten-foot-wide steel shafts</i>

04:16.664 --> 04:19.916
<i>to depths of as much as 170 feet</i>

04:20.001 --> 04:24.763
<i>and hopefully solve the Oak
Island mystery once and for all.</i>

04:24.922 --> 04:27.599
We're gonna put in
several ten-foot cans,

04:27.758 --> 04:31.436
each of which is gonna be
bigger than 10-X.

04:31.595 --> 04:36.516
<i>Dan Blankenship, Dan Henskee
Dave Blankenship</i>

04:36.609 --> 04:40.445
<i>worked for ten years
to get one of those down.</i>

04:40.604 --> 04:42.197
We're gonna do several of them
this year,

04:42.356 --> 04:44.274
and they're each
gonna be bigger.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.785
As far as rate of digging,
using a larger can,

04:46.944 --> 04:48.528
is there a larger hammer grab,
or we'll be using

04:48.612 --> 04:50.613
the same hammer grab
that we used last time?

04:50.707 --> 04:52.791
Uh, we will use
a larger hammer grab.

04:52.875 --> 04:54.701
<i>I believe it's
a 2710 hammer grab.</i>

04:54.794 --> 04:56.703
Okay, so we'll have
more volume coming up

04:56.787 --> 04:58.547
- with each grab as well.
- CRAIG: Yep.

04:58.631 --> 05:01.207
It's a lot of material
put through the wash plant.

05:01.292 --> 05:03.376
It's a lot more water
coming on location

05:03.461 --> 05:04.720
that we need to handle.

05:04.879 --> 05:07.222
- Good.
<i>- MARTY: By the way,</i>

05:07.307 --> 05:10.133
we would like to do this
as nondestructive as possible

05:10.217 --> 05:11.893
<i>because, boy, this is,
this is something.</i>

05:11.978 --> 05:16.806
We did detect, uh, actual gold

05:16.891 --> 05:19.234
<i>in a certain part
of the Money Pit.</i>

05:19.393 --> 05:20.560
<i>Okay, what about timing?</i>

05:20.644 --> 05:22.812
When-when is this
all gonna happen?

05:22.897 --> 05:24.147
Tell me when you want us.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.649
If we had to put big cans
down today, we'd have...

05:26.743 --> 05:28.902
- We'd be making guesstimates.
- Mm-hmm.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.653
And we want to be
more precise than that,

05:30.738 --> 05:32.322
especially given
the significance

05:32.415 --> 05:35.417
of the gold and silver
trace elements.

05:35.501 --> 05:37.419
We want to allow
the drill program

05:37.503 --> 05:39.921
to get us as much information
as possible.

05:40.006 --> 05:42.924
So the idea was
four to six weeks.

05:43.084 --> 05:44.751
That's excellent.
That's great.

05:44.835 --> 05:47.087
I think we'll be,
We'll be, uh, ready for that.

05:47.171 --> 05:49.681
But let me ask you
a question there, big brother.

05:49.840 --> 05:52.184
<i>Can you and Craig say,
"Okay, we're gonna do</i>

05:52.343 --> 05:54.844
<i>one caisson for sure"
or "two for sure"?</i>

05:54.937 --> 05:58.523
We've picked four.
Uh, we think that's reasonable.

05:58.608 --> 06:00.942
<i>MARTY: So, we're gonna
do four ten-foot cans,</i>

06:01.102 --> 06:02.769
<i>and you believe we're gonna have</i>

06:02.853 --> 06:05.688
four good places to do it?
Right?

06:05.773 --> 06:07.699
It's a great problem, right?

06:07.784 --> 06:10.702
<i>I mean... (chuckles)
first can we put down,</i>

06:10.787 --> 06:14.697
bingo, who cares if we put
three more down, right?

06:14.791 --> 06:16.958
Oh, okay, I agree with that.
Yes, yes.

06:17.043 --> 06:18.710
<i>And if we only put one down,</i>

06:18.869 --> 06:21.204
we might be able to pay them
in doubloons, right?

06:21.288 --> 06:22.881
<i>- You guys would take that, wouldn't you?</i>
- (laughter)

06:24.291 --> 06:26.876
It feels like things are
coming together,

06:26.961 --> 06:29.388
<i>and I'm very hopeful.</i>

06:29.547 --> 06:32.048
<i>So let's launch it all,
and let's-let's do this.</i>

06:32.133 --> 06:34.976
- Full speed ahead.
- Full speed ahead.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.636
Okay, well,
thank you, everybody.

06:36.720 --> 06:39.222
I think we all have
a lot of work to do.

06:39.315 --> 06:41.141
It should be an exciting year.

06:41.225 --> 06:42.976
- Thank you.
<i>- Goodbye.</i>

06:43.060 --> 06:44.903
<i>- RICK: Take care.

<i>He didn't have all these people

08:20.824 --> 08:22.492
There's some right there

08:22.585 --> 08:24.169
- BILLY: Yeah.
- JACK: Whoa.

Yeah, there's plenty of iron
just there.

In fact, there's plenty of iron
all in that layer.

08:55.693 --> 08:57.035

09:08.130 --> 09:09.464
Here, feel how heavy
it is, Jack.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.967
- That's heavy, isn't it?
- Mm-hmm. Heavy metal.

09:12.126 --> 09:15.971

- I'll go at a bit of an angle.

09:34.991 --> 09:36.491
RICK:
Iron, though, right?

09:36.650 --> 09:39.402

what this find might tell us,</i>

40:32.671 --> 40:34.764
<i>so I look forward to it.</i>

40:34.849 --> 40:38.092
The reason why we apply science
and technology is

40:38.177 --> 40:42.272
to lead us further
on the road to the answers.

40:42.431 --> 40:45.099
But we've got to just
get out there,

40:45.192 --> 40:47.277
eyes and boots,
get on the ground

40:47.436 --> 40:49.103
and figure out
what this may mean.

40:49.188 --> 40:54.358
It's just opened up a-a whole
new search agenda, literally.

40:54.452 --> 40:57.704
<i>- So, thank you very much.
- COLIN: Thank you.</i>

40:57.788 --> 41:00.698
<i>NARRATOR: For Rick, Marty
and the Fellowship of the Dig,</i>

41:00.782 --> 41:03.701
<i>the path to solving a mystery</i>

41:03.794 --> 41:06.212
<i>that has captivated the world
for two centuries</i>

41:06.297 --> 41:09.707
<i>appears more defined than ever.</i>

41:09.800 --> 41:13.377
<i>With new clues being revealed
across the island,</i>

41:13.462 --> 41:15.972
<i>and an ambitious plan</i>

41:16.131 --> 41:18.558
<i>to excavate the Money Pit
taking shape,</i>

41:18.717 --> 41:22.803
<i>could this finally be the year
of the ultimate discovery?</i>

41:22.888 --> 41:28.226
<i>Or will a legendary curse
emerge once again</i>

41:28.310 --> 41:31.905
<i>and drastically alter
their course?</i>

41:35.150 --> 41:37.818
<i>Next time on</i>
The Curse of Oak Island...

41:37.903 --> 41:40.330
- (beeping) - We have
winkled that signal out, mate.

41:40.414 --> 41:41.664
Fingers crossed.

41:41.823 --> 41:43.491
- JACK: Yeah!
- GARY: Look at that roundness!

41:43.575 --> 41:45.993
Zinc, lead, iron.

41:46.086 --> 41:48.246
- GARY: Gold, Jack.
- No way.

41:48.330 --> 41:51.582
There's a large piece of wood
that lines up with the road.

41:51.675 --> 41:54.093
This is almost exactly
what we were looking for.

41:54.253 --> 41:55.169
It's more than we expected.

41:55.262 --> 41:56.763
ALEX:
Hey, look at this.

41:56.922 --> 41:58.932
Bingo! This is Christmas.

41:59.016 --> 42:00.350
That would apply to a chamber,

42:00.509 --> 42:01.425
- wouldn't it?
- It would apply to a chamber.

42:01.519 --> 42:03.019
MARTY:
Holy smokes.
