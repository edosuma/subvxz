That's a thought.
No!

11:28.396 --> 11:30.397
We don't need
a war of the worlds.

11:30.482 --> 11:32.900
That's it! We need
a war of the worlds!

11:32.984 --> 11:34.401

Dork calling Orson!
Dork calling Orson!

11:41.034 --> 11:42.284
You're asking me,

11:42.369 --> 11:45.079
the renowned spokesman
for Paul Masson wine,

11:45.163 --> 11:48.749
to recreate my brilliant
1938 radio broadcast

11:48.833 --> 11:52.544
merely to deceive
and impress the wife
of this skinny reptile?

11:52.629 --> 11:54.046
Sorry. Never mind.

11:54.130 --> 11:55.297
I'll do it for free.

11:57.967 --> 12:00.302
Ladies and gentlemen,
we interrupt our program

12:13.066 --> 12:16.819
I'm speaking to you
from the hickory farms
in Grover's Mall, New Jersey,

12:16.903 --> 12:18.779
through a mouthful
of summer sausage,

12:18.863 --> 12:22.074
mmm, where I hardly
know where to begin. Mmm!

12:22.492 --> 12:26.328
A huge spacecraft,
piloted by
a devastatingly handsome...

12:26.413 --> 12:28.580

Now, how in God's name

12:28.665 --> 12:30.124
do I know
what the fellow looks like

12:30.208 --> 12:32.418
if he's inside a ship
miles in the air?

12:32.502 --> 12:34.294
It's just foolish
on its face.

12:34.379 --> 12:36.797
If you want the cheese log,
you'll read what I wrote.

12:36.881 --> 12:38.966
Very well.
I shall comply.

12:40.844 --> 12:42.719
I'm getting reports
that cities across the globe

12:42.846 --> 12:45.180
are being destroyed
by this noble invader,

12:45.306 --> 12:48.934
whose good looks are
apparently discernible
across vast distances

12:49.018 --> 12:50.519
and through solid metal.

12:50.812 --> 12:54.189
But wait,
the leader of the attack
is swaggering out of his ship

12:54.274 --> 12:57.276
and up to a convenient
nearby microphone.

12:57.819 --> 13:00.571
Now, why couldn't I have
just described his
appearance at this point?

13:00.780 --> 13:02.865
This is the type of
thing I'm talking about.

13:03.199 --> 13:07.327

Earth is conquered,

of civilization complete.

13:38.067 --> 13:41.737
To hell with
Little Orphan Annie!
We've got to do something.

13:42.238 --> 13:44.490
What's that, honey?
How many dead?

13:44.574 --> 13:47.034
I don't know, 80 million?

13:47.160 --> 13:49.578
Okay. I love you, too.

So, you thought you could
conquer us so easily, eh?

14:10.600 --> 14:12.267
Nice job. We surrender.

14:13.269 --> 14:15.187
Earth is yours.

have that cheese log?

permit me to
offer up a sacrifice.

Hey!

14:34.290 --> 14:35.415
Yeah, he'll do.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.459
Come on, Lrrr.
Show's over.

14:37.794 --> 14:38.961

to this right now!

why are you yelling softly
with the purple-furred one?

Uh, it's nothing, my queen.

we caved like a house

Peace with honor.

about Lrrr's low-sodium diet.

get the leg taste
out of my mouth.

not out there!

one must use finesse.

all a fake. I just wanted
to impress you.

been hiding from me?

one date. I barely mated
with her.

I harbor no
resentment against her.
