WEBVTT

00:05.800 --> 00:08.636
OK. Closing time. Everybody out.

00:08.762 --> 00:11.550
Harry, how did you get in here?

00:11.683 --> 00:13.094
I came in the back door.

00:13.227 --> 00:14.971
I don't have a back door.

00:15.104 --> 00:17.394
Well, then, it's my secret.

00:19.151 --> 00:21.145
I've been serving him all night.

00:21.279 --> 00:24.530
Diane, you know I don't like
this flimflam man in my bar.

00:26.036 --> 00:28.824
Sam, that's a bit unfair, isn't it?

00:28.956 --> 00:33.750
Anyone with half a brain can see
through his petty scams and tricks.

00:34.213 --> 00:36.041
You're too kind. Thanks.

00:36.967 --> 00:39.720
I hope he doesn't try
to pull anything on you.

00:39.846 --> 00:43.216
Me? It is to laugh.

00:45.103 --> 00:48.853
Diane, I like you, you're smart.
Let me help you clean up.

00:49.525 --> 00:52.397
You gotta keep the cover
on this table,

00:52.530 --> 00:56.576
because the heat from the lights
will crack the felt.

00:56.702 --> 00:58.113
Take care of it.

00:59.122 --> 01:03.501
Harry, I'll take care of it.
You can leave.

01:03.628 --> 01:07.413
Let me save you a couple of steps
with the check. I'll pay Sam.

01:07.550 --> 01:08.546
Thanks.

01:11.722 --> 01:13.133
Take care of that table.

01:14.184 --> 01:16.676
Men can't make beds, either.

01:17.480 --> 01:20.185
OK, Sam. Thanks a lot. Goodnight.

01:20.317 --> 01:22.357
Harry, the bill.

01:22.486 --> 01:25.773
- It's OK, I paid Diane.
- I don't trust you.

01:25.908 --> 01:29.159
Diane,
will you tell Sam it's covered?

01:29.287 --> 01:31.281
It's covered.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.074

02:55.904 --> 02:58.574
Sorry I'm late,
but wait till you hear what I did.

03:00.160 --> 03:04.241
This afternoon,
I spent five entire hours

03:04.374 --> 03:06.497
in a sensory deprivation tank.

03:06.627 --> 03:09.000
Your room?

03:09.631 --> 03:11.707
I'm telling you, it was incredible.

03:11.842 --> 03:15.177
Never have I felt more aware
of what's going on around me.

03:15.305 --> 03:17.345
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

03:17.474 --> 03:22.601
The whole idea is that there's
a total lack of sensory input.

03:24.275 --> 03:26.269
What the hell's going on here?

03:26.403 --> 03:27.981
A book promotion party.

03:28.114 --> 03:31.032
How can that be
in a place where no one can read?

03:33.454 --> 03:35.661
My old roommate, Tom Kenderson,

03:35.791 --> 03:38.164
wrote his autobiography,
and I'm in it.

03:40.964 --> 03:46.387
So, it's a press conference for
yet another thick-headed jock epic?

03:47.515 --> 03:50.885
There must be confetti
all over the Library of Congress.

03:51.020 --> 03:52.431
For your information,

03:52.563 --> 03:55.934
this one's different.
It's got a lot of good stuff in it.

03:56.068 --> 03:59.521
- Like what?
- Well, I haven't read it, actually.

04:00.449 --> 04:03.700
- No, no.
- Didn't want to wear out your lips?

04:05.456 --> 04:09.669
I meant to read it last night,
but an emergency came up.

04:09.795 --> 04:13.841
- And what was her name?
- Sherry. That's not the point.

04:13.967 --> 04:19.308
Tom's book should be really exciting
due to the times we had together.

04:19.433 --> 04:22.554
It's about how we handled
the pressures of baseball.

04:22.687 --> 04:24.645
Guys handle it differently.

04:24.773 --> 04:27.728
Some guys turn to the bottle,
some guys chase chicks.

04:27.861 --> 04:30.103
Tom and I couldn't make up our minds.

04:30.239 --> 04:32.647
- So you did both?
- Yeah.

04:34.036 --> 04:37.951
OK, well,
let me speed-read this sucker.

04:39.376 --> 04:41.251
And then we can talk.

04:42.506 --> 04:46.207
- How long is that gonna take?
- I'm on chapter four.

04:49.098 --> 04:51.803
I always loved that kid Tommy.

04:51.935 --> 04:54.427
Just a riot.
He was always pulling something.

04:54.563 --> 04:55.560
Is that right?

04:55.690 --> 04:59.226
He put my toothbrush
in his sweaty socks,

04:59.362 --> 05:01.402
left dead animals in my locker.

05:02.240 --> 05:06.156
One time, him and some guys held me
down and shaved my whole body.

05:06.288 --> 05:08.364
You just let him do that to you?

05:08.499 --> 05:14.041
No, Cliff. He was trying
to cram me into a clothes dryer.

05:14.173 --> 05:17.045
I pulled his socks
right over his spikes.

05:17.177 --> 05:19.170
Good one, Coach.

05:19.305 --> 05:23.256
What a laugh the guys got. I could
see them through that little window.

05:23.394 --> 05:25.054
They were laughing.

05:25.188 --> 05:26.849
Mayday.

05:31.446 --> 05:33.238
- What a to-do.
- How about this?

05:33.366 --> 05:34.362
Sam.

05:34.492 --> 05:38.741
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Carla Tortelli, Tom Kenderson.

05:38.873 --> 05:41.199
Carla, nice to meet you.

05:42.002 --> 05:44.079
I love you, Tom Kenderson.

05:44.214 --> 05:48.924
Look, here's my number and
a couple of quotes from past lovers.

05:49.053 --> 05:51.011
- Thank you.
- Come here, sweetheart.

05:51.140 --> 05:55.684
Sam, he breathed on me.
I'm a whole woman.

05:55.812 --> 05:58.055
Coach, get her a seltzer.

05:58.191 --> 06:03.649
- Sam, did you read my book?
- No, I didn't. I'm sorry.

06:03.782 --> 06:05.739
I really wish you had.

06:05.868 --> 06:07.944
Did you put in that flight
to Kansas City

06:08.079 --> 06:11.081
when we jumped in the garment bag
with two stewardesses?

06:11.208 --> 06:13.782
- Yeah, but...
- Then I'll die happy.

06:13.920 --> 06:17.088
- Listen, let's get you famous.
- You don't understand...

06:17.216 --> 06:19.673
Tommy, good to see you.

06:19.803 --> 06:21.214
- How you doing?
- Great.

06:21.347 --> 06:25.891
Remember the time you put
the analgesic balm in my jockstrap?

06:26.020 --> 06:27.301
Yeah.

06:27.438 --> 06:29.396
I think of you when I get the itch.

06:29.524 --> 06:32.776
- lt's good to be remembered, Coach.
- My God.

06:32.904 --> 06:35.111
Mr Kenderson, can we begin?

06:35.783 --> 06:37.990
Yeah, let's start. Let's do it.

06:40.498 --> 06:43.749
Before we start,
Sam Malone, come up here.

06:45.755 --> 06:49.884
You all remember Sam, and if you
don't, chapters seven through nine.

06:50.010 --> 06:54.425
No, I'm a businessman now. I keep
my clothes on, most of the time.

06:54.558 --> 06:57.346
So, you two were real close?

06:57.479 --> 07:01.394
For three years we did everything
together. We were never apart.

07:01.526 --> 07:06.569
It must've been a shock when Tom
wrote about coming out of the closet.

07:09.620 --> 07:11.494
You mean in Detroit?

07:11.623 --> 07:17.248
I was with the waitress, and he
came out of the closet wearing a...

07:17.673 --> 07:19.713
That's not it, is it?

07:19.842 --> 07:21.919
Yikes.

07:27.018 --> 07:28.893
Is this some kind of joke?

07:29.021 --> 07:32.059
I wanted you to read the book, Sam.

07:32.192 --> 07:35.609
It's still hard for me
to tell people from the old days.

07:35.739 --> 07:39.904
Sam, you said you two
used to do everything together?

07:40.036 --> 07:42.610
No, you misunderstood that.

07:42.748 --> 07:46.249
No. As a matter of fact,
people used to come up to me and say,

07:46.378 --> 07:50.128
"You two are best friends,
yet you're completely different."

07:50.258 --> 07:54.553
Sam, there's an emergency
in the back room.

07:54.681 --> 07:59.178
- What?
- I found holes in the pool table.

07:59.979 --> 08:01.558
Yeah.

08:01.690 --> 08:03.101
Will you excuse me?

08:03.234 --> 08:06.189
Some chick wants to see me.
I can't get rid of 'em.

08:06.321 --> 08:08.445
You guys know how it is.

08:09.701 --> 08:12.572
So, honey, you can't go
in the back room without me?

08:12.705 --> 08:14.745
Shut up.

08:15.667 --> 08:19.168
Say it ain't so, Tom.
Say it ain't so.

08:19.673 --> 08:23.043
Thanks for getting me out
before I made an ass of myself.

08:23.177 --> 08:25.752
I was fast but you were faster.

08:25.889 --> 08:28.428
It wasn't my fault.
He should've told me.

08:28.560 --> 08:31.134
Sam, he told you to read the book.

08:31.272 --> 08:32.434
Yeah, but...

08:32.565 --> 08:35.602
He should've known that
you'd have been with a woman

08:35.736 --> 08:38.489
who thinks <i>Candide</i>
is a toenail polish.

08:39.950 --> 08:41.741
I just can't believe it.

08:41.869 --> 08:44.741
The guy was a hound.
He had women everywhere.

08:44.873 --> 08:46.748
We'd go into hotel lobbies,

08:46.876 --> 08:49.712
there'd be three or four women
holding up kids.

08:54.595 --> 08:56.006
He covers that.

08:56.138 --> 08:58.511
- Where?
- Here, in this paragraph.

08:58.642 --> 09:00.931
- Want me to read it?
- No, I'll read it.

09:01.062 --> 09:02.972
- Right there?
- Yes.

09:03.106 --> 09:06.856
"From the outside, my days
in baseball seemed glorious,

09:06.986 --> 09:10.439
but the greater my fear
became of my true sexuality,

09:10.574 --> 09:15.784
the more I compensated
with typical Don Juan promiscuity."

09:15.915 --> 09:18.122
- Does that explain it?
- I don't know.

09:18.251 --> 09:20.161
I've only read it once.

09:23.926 --> 09:27.676
He was denying who he was.
He's no longer doing that.

09:30.184 --> 09:31.595
I should've known.

09:31.728 --> 09:36.190
I remember sitting in a piano bar
and he requested a show tune.

09:42.659 --> 09:46.279
Sam, I do understand
why you're upset.

09:47.249 --> 09:50.085
You're afraid that now,
people will think you're...

09:50.211 --> 09:52.251
No, I'm not upset.

09:53.465 --> 09:57.630
It's just that guys should be guys,
Diane. That's all.

10:00.809 --> 10:03.479
Sam, look.

10:03.604 --> 10:05.847
Your friend Tom's out there.

10:05.982 --> 10:09.684
He needs your support now
more than ever before.

10:09.821 --> 10:12.527
He really hasn't changed.

10:12.658 --> 10:16.953
He's still the same guy you used to
tinkle off balconies with.

10:19.375 --> 10:23.505
Boy, the world
was a lot simpler then.

10:28.554 --> 10:30.797
Sam, I'm sorry about all this.

10:30.933 --> 10:33.306
I thought you'd read the book
and it was cool.

10:33.436 --> 10:37.186
I don't wanna cause you any more
problems, so I'm gonna take off.

10:41.906 --> 10:43.531
Damn it.

10:48.957 --> 10:52.872
Thanks a lot, everybody.
It was nice talking to you all again.

10:53.004 --> 10:54.831
So long, Tommy.

10:55.382 --> 10:57.007
Tom?

10:58.094 --> 11:00.134
You still a gin-and-tonic man?

11:02.141 --> 11:04.348
Way to go, Mayday.

11:04.478 --> 11:08.607
I make 'em the way you like 'em.
On the house. Coach.

11:14.116 --> 11:17.153
- Thanks a lot, Sam.
- Can we get more shots of you guys?

11:18.038 --> 11:19.782
Yeah, sure. You bet.

11:20.833 --> 11:23.241
I appreciate this, Sam. I really do.

11:23.378 --> 11:26.131
You didn't dump me
when I had a drinking problem.

11:26.257 --> 11:29.923
I sure did.
You were passed out at the time.

11:33.642 --> 11:36.134
Where are these photos gonna run?

11:36.270 --> 11:38.762
I don't know. Mostly local papers.

11:40.818 --> 11:42.277
What's the matter?

11:42.404 --> 11:46.189
Same thing will happen at Cheers
that happened at Vito's Pub.

11:58.217 --> 12:02.512
Sam looks as terrific in
black and white as he does in colour.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.763
Looking at Tom breaks my heart.

12:05.309 --> 12:08.347
- Hey, everybody.
- Hi, Sam.

12:09.982 --> 12:13.934
We were looking at your kisser
in the morning rag here, Sam.

12:14.071 --> 12:15.649
Yeah, I saw that.

12:15.782 --> 12:19.532
Every time I look at this,
I feel so proud of you.

12:19.662 --> 12:21.988
I'm kinda glad I did that now.

12:22.124 --> 12:26.039
You're taking real strides
in your development as a human being.

12:26.171 --> 12:28.579
A couple of other chicks
said so, too.

12:28.716 --> 12:32.300
This human-being image will get me
more action than cheap wine.

12:34.515 --> 12:36.841
Always the high road.

12:41.108 --> 12:42.104
Norm?

12:42.234 --> 12:44.192
What was that you said yesterday,

12:44.320 --> 12:47.358
when they were taking pictures,
about Vito's Pub?

12:47.491 --> 12:51.193
- It's nothing. Don't worry about it.
- Talk to me, Norm.

12:51.330 --> 12:54.082
Norm, it's best he hears it from us.

12:54.209 --> 12:57.080
Well, go ahead, tell him the story.

12:57.797 --> 13:01.547
- You heard of Vito's Pub?
- It's a gay bar, right?

13:01.677 --> 13:05.842
Didn't used to be. It used to be
a great bar. I hung out there myself.

13:05.974 --> 13:08.134
What a story, Norm.

13:10.314 --> 13:12.984
- I'm not finished.
- There's more?

13:14.653 --> 13:18.568
One night Vito lets a gay group
hold a meeting in the back room.

13:18.700 --> 13:21.571
Gays For The Metric System,
or something.

13:22.622 --> 13:25.707
Story got in the newspaper.
Gets a lot of attention.

13:25.834 --> 13:30.794
Next thing you know,
Vito's Pub turns into Vito's Pub.

13:32.260 --> 13:34.383
All the regulars left, Sammy.

13:34.513 --> 13:38.678
Out went the oars and the moose
heads, in came plants and ferns.

13:38.810 --> 13:40.222
Ferns.

13:40.813 --> 13:43.850
I just don't want that to happen
at Cheers.

13:43.984 --> 13:46.855
I don't believe it.
Bars don't turn gay overnight.

13:46.988 --> 13:50.488
You don't have to believe me.
I have scientific proof. Cliff?

13:50.618 --> 13:52.029
- It happened.
- See?

13:54.331 --> 13:56.324
Excuse me.

13:56.459 --> 13:59.995
You're talking about them
like they're ogres.

14:00.131 --> 14:04.545
The fact is, there are gay people
in this bar all the time.

14:04.678 --> 14:07.716
No way. I haven't seen
a gay guy in here in ages.

14:08.600 --> 14:11.768
- So you can spot a gay person?
- A mile away.

14:12.689 --> 14:15.561
And there are none
in here right now?

14:16.444 --> 14:19.731
Nope. Looks like
a straight crowd to me.

14:20.241 --> 14:22.365
Too ugly to be gay.

14:22.494 --> 14:24.867
Too ugly to be out.

14:29.921 --> 14:35.712
I wasn't going to say anything,
but you've proved you're open-minded.

14:35.845 --> 14:40.260
There are two homosexual gentlemen
in this bar at this moment.

14:40.393 --> 14:42.517
Come on. Get outta here.

14:42.646 --> 14:46.266
They told me they were gay,
and they appreciated what Sam did.

14:46.401 --> 14:50.650
That's right. They're here right now
and you don't even know who they are.

14:52.618 --> 14:56.783
Nah, she's kidding.
Everybody here checks out alright.

14:57.791 --> 14:59.203
Well, I don't know.

14:59.335 --> 15:06.218
It occurs to me that... Cliff
hasn't had a date in quite some time.

15:06.345 --> 15:08.137
He's right.

15:08.264 --> 15:13.889
Yeah? How come we've never seen this
Vera you're allegedly married to?

15:15.899 --> 15:18.937
Could we have a couple of beers,
please?

15:19.070 --> 15:20.481
You bet.

15:21.699 --> 15:23.359
Patty-cake alert.

15:24.035 --> 15:26.278
- You're Sam Malone.
- Right.

15:26.413 --> 15:29.618
- I saw your picture in the paper.
- That's good.

15:29.751 --> 15:32.041
Can't wait to read that book.

15:32.171 --> 15:35.672
I'm not much of a baseball fan,
but it sounds interesting.

15:35.801 --> 15:39.136
- It should be pretty good.
- Could we have light beers?

15:39.264 --> 15:41.304
Light beer.

15:44.229 --> 15:46.436
- There you go.
- Thanks.

15:47.942 --> 15:50.517
Sam, those guys look OK to me.

15:51.322 --> 15:52.865
They are OK, Coach.

15:52.991 --> 15:56.159
Maybe we are a little off base, Norm.

15:56.829 --> 15:58.657
Let's test them out.

15:58.790 --> 16:00.499
I got an idea.

16:01.836 --> 16:03.960
Look at the bagonzas on that babe.

16:07.927 --> 16:09.636
This is medieval.

16:09.763 --> 16:12.884
I never knew
Lorne Greene had bagonzas.

16:14.144 --> 16:18.475
Say, Jack, change channel.
It's time for the Benito-Venito bout.

16:18.609 --> 16:20.483
Should be a blood match.

16:22.238 --> 16:24.813
They're not watching.
Let's string 'em up.

16:27.495 --> 16:30.700
What are we gonna do
about these guys?

16:31.334 --> 16:35.250
Carla, you're not
prejudiced against gays, are you?

16:35.381 --> 16:38.217
I'm not exactly crazy about them.

16:38.343 --> 16:42.010
I mean,
I get enough competition from women.

16:42.140 --> 16:44.679
If guys keep
coming out of the closet,

16:44.810 --> 16:46.804
there won't be anybody left to date,

16:46.938 --> 16:49.395
and I'll have to start
going out with girls.

16:52.654 --> 16:57.401
Don't worry about me. I like
my dates more masculine than you.

16:57.536 --> 16:59.529
Not much, but a little.

17:01.166 --> 17:05.461
I can't believe you're making
such a fuss over two guys in a bar.

17:08.384 --> 17:11.136
- Patty-cake.
- It's an orgy.

17:11.262 --> 17:14.015
Ferns, Sammy. We're talking ferns.

17:14.893 --> 17:18.012
Come on. I've seen you guys hug.

17:18.146 --> 17:20.354
- Yeah, but we hate it.
- Right.

17:21.401 --> 17:26.609
Cliff, I haven't been to Clancy's
in ages. ls it still a nice place?

17:26.742 --> 17:29.234
I don't know.
I haven't been there for a while.

17:29.370 --> 17:31.660
- Let's go on over there.
- Good idea.

17:31.790 --> 17:34.365
Clancy's? Give me a break.
You're kidding?

17:34.502 --> 17:39.166
We'll check in in a few weeks and see
if Cheers is still the kind of bar

17:39.300 --> 17:42.386
where a single woman
can be assured of being harassed.

17:42.513 --> 17:44.969
Get back here, all of you, right now.

17:47.019 --> 17:50.140
You mean to tell me
you guys are baling out on me?

17:50.273 --> 17:53.608
I'm telling you, within a month
there'll be wild music

17:53.736 --> 17:56.655
and guys dancing
and exchanging phone numbers.

17:56.782 --> 18:00.616
You know, Sam, you've got
some really great friends here.

18:00.746 --> 18:03.035
You've gone out of your way
to make a bar

18:03.166 --> 18:06.666
where customers can feel
like they belong, part of a family.

18:06.796 --> 18:10.747
- Now they're walking out on you.
- We don't want them.

18:16.225 --> 18:17.340
Quiet.

18:18.061 --> 18:21.229
Perhaps we should
step into the back room.

18:21.357 --> 18:25.819
Anyone having something
intelligent to say can follow me.

18:29.409 --> 18:31.403
Fine. Anyone with a two-bit opinion.

18:31.537 --> 18:33.080
Alright. I'll tell you.

18:43.136 --> 18:47.551
Sammy, I've got a simple solution
to this whole problem.

18:47.684 --> 18:50.805
You just go up to the guys
and politely ask them to leave,

18:50.938 --> 18:53.727
and everything is back to normal.

18:55.111 --> 18:58.896
Sam would never do that.
Would you, Sam?

19:00.451 --> 19:02.112
No.

19:02.454 --> 19:05.124
I'm not sure.
These guys are my regulars.

19:05.249 --> 19:07.041
If I lose them, I lose my bar.

19:07.169 --> 19:12.331
If single women stop coming in here,
I have no reason to live.

19:13.260 --> 19:18.968
No emotional appeal here, Sam. This
is a purely intellectual argument.

19:19.519 --> 19:25.274
You let this bar go gay, you are
gonna have to hire male waitresses.

19:25.401 --> 19:28.024
Right?
That means I'm out on the street,

19:28.155 --> 19:32.735
and I'm not gonna be able to feed
little Sammy Tortelli.

19:34.706 --> 19:36.414
He kicked.

19:36.541 --> 19:40.375
What?
What's that he's trying to say there?

19:41.715 --> 19:45.797
I'm hungry. I'm hungry.

19:46.764 --> 19:50.015
Please don't let Sammy do this to us.

19:50.602 --> 19:53.390
Thanks for
keeping emotions out of it.

19:53.898 --> 19:55.607
I think it's a trick, Sam.

19:56.193 --> 19:58.400
- Sit down.
- We're all agreed, then.

19:58.529 --> 20:01.781
Sammy tells these guys to leave,
we don't go to Clancy's.

20:04.746 --> 20:06.455
- Alright.
- Sam.

20:06.582 --> 20:09.667
Just leave me alone.
I'm running a business here.

20:11.881 --> 20:14.455
What do you think
I should say to them?

20:15.218 --> 20:17.046
It's very simple.

20:17.179 --> 20:21.558
You just say, "Hello,
we're a group of snivelling bigots

20:21.685 --> 20:24.012
and we don't care for your kind."

20:24.147 --> 20:25.891
That's good. I like that.

20:39.626 --> 20:41.370
Hi, fellas.

20:41.504 --> 20:43.248
Hi, Sam. What's going on?

20:43.381 --> 20:46.004
I've got a problem.
Maybe you can help me out.

20:46.135 --> 20:48.212
See, I'm the own of this bar.

20:48.346 --> 20:51.432
Yeah, we know. We read the article
in the newspaper.

20:51.559 --> 20:52.970
Right.

20:53.103 --> 20:55.808
- That took a lot of guts.
- It really did.

20:55.940 --> 20:57.814
Yeah.

20:57.943 --> 20:59.852
So what's your problem?

21:00.863 --> 21:03.106
As a matter of fact,
I don't have a problem.

21:03.241 --> 21:06.160
Coach, get these guys
a beer on the house.

21:06.287 --> 21:08.031
Right, Sam.

21:08.165 --> 21:09.957
Chickening out on us?

21:10.084 --> 21:13.750
Yeah, Sammy, I thought
you had more character.

21:13.881 --> 21:17.251
Those guys are staying.
Anyone else wants to leave, fine.

21:17.385 --> 21:19.545
You know what kind of bar
this could be?

21:19.680 --> 21:23.347
Not the kind
that I have to throw people out of.

21:23.477 --> 21:26.265
That was the noblest preposition
you ever dangled.

21:29.485 --> 21:30.896
Thank you.

21:32.823 --> 21:35.315
- Now, let me say this.
- No.

21:35.451 --> 21:36.911
Fine.

21:37.663 --> 21:39.157
Alright, gentlemen.

21:39.290 --> 21:42.043
Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

21:42.169 --> 21:44.577
What are you gonna do?

21:44.714 --> 21:46.707
Coach, last call.

21:46.842 --> 21:50.128
What are you talking about?
It's quarter to seven.

21:50.263 --> 21:55.425
No time. The glasses have to be
off the tables by seven.

21:56.313 --> 22:00.312
Excuse me. This bar closes at seven?

22:00.443 --> 22:06.069
Only on the first Thursday of every
month. <i>Vive la Différence</i> evening.

22:06.201 --> 22:11.707
We go home to our wives, girlfriends,
work benches, power tools...

22:12.334 --> 22:15.253
This is the weirdest bar
I've ever been in.

22:17.800 --> 22:19.674
Coach, what the hell are you doing?

22:19.803 --> 22:22.211
This is <i>Vive la Diff</i>é<i>rence</i> night.

22:22.348 --> 22:25.184
- Where the hell did the month go?
- What?

22:25.310 --> 22:28.514
Your regulars
just tricked those guys out.

22:28.648 --> 22:29.644
How?

22:35.991 --> 22:38.863
Let's have a round here, Sammy.

22:39.454 --> 22:43.204
- What's going on here?
- We got rid of your friends.

22:43.334 --> 22:46.372
It was Norm's idea.
The man's a genius.

22:46.505 --> 22:48.083
Way to go.

22:48.717 --> 22:53.464
Norman, there's something
you should know about those guys.

22:53.598 --> 22:55.009
They're not gay.

22:55.142 --> 22:57.301
In fact,
one of them tried to hit on me.

22:57.437 --> 22:59.763
What? You said they were.

22:59.898 --> 23:04.147
I said there were two gay men here.
I didn't say who they were.

23:04.279 --> 23:07.732
They, along with myself,
have had a wonderful time

23:07.867 --> 23:11.284
watching you
make complete idiots of yourselves.

23:11.831 --> 23:15.332
Yeah, the guys
I was talking about are still here.

23:15.920 --> 23:18.838
- Right, guys?
- Right.

23:25.099 --> 23:26.510
Better than Vera.
