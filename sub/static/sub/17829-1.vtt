So it's done then?

We were fooling ourselves...

02:25.645 --> 02:27.279
It was a mistake.

02:28.648 --> 02:30.315
Don't say that.

02:31.584 --> 02:33.785
Don't call it a mistake.

02:35.688 --> 02:38.757
We've already been through it.

02:38.759 --> 02:41.126
There's really nothing more
to say.

02:41.128 --> 02:42.861
I tried though.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.099
You at least know
that much, don't you?

02:47.101 --> 02:49.134
I know, David.

02:49.136 --> 02:50.136
I know.

02:50.703 --> 02:53.205
And what about this place?

02:53.207 --> 02:55.040
We got it for the season.

02:56.442 --> 02:59.378
You're the one who wanted to come
out here, for Christ's sake.

03:34.447 --> 03:36.081
Picked up most of it on my way.

03:36.083 --> 03:37.983
This should last you a while.

03:40.954 --> 03:43.255
Thanks for coming by.
I know it's a long way.

03:43.257 --> 03:44.723
Ah, it's nothing.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.558
I was glad you called.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.960
Anyway, I like the drive.

03:47.962 --> 03:50.195
The city can get
a bit overwhelming.

03:51.698 --> 03:53.365
It's quiet out here.

03:54.934 --> 03:56.802
There's some other houses,
but...

03:56.804 --> 03:59.071
I haven't seen
anyone else around.

04:00.807 --> 04:03.642
It's what draws people out here
in the first place.

04:04.911 --> 04:05.911
The isolation.

04:06.879 --> 04:10.249
I personally never understood
the appeal of it...

04:10.251 --> 04:13.452
It's there... for some.

04:17.624 --> 04:19.725
Another thing I'm having
a hard time with

04:19.726 --> 04:21.326
is all this light.

04:22.128 --> 04:24.096
It never seems to get dark
out here.

04:24.098 --> 04:25.897
Can't get used to it.

04:25.899 --> 04:27.699
I actually quite like it.

04:28.501 --> 04:30.502
It's easier to get work done.

04:32.505 --> 04:35.073
Yeah, but there's no sense
of time.

04:36.643 --> 04:38.777
And it's much harder to sleep.

04:42.048 --> 04:43.915
It's a shame about Eva,

04:43.917 --> 04:45.484
really it is.
But...

04:46.419 --> 04:48.887
Well, you know
how these things go by now.

04:48.889 --> 04:51.923
It'll take some time.
Always does.

04:53.926 --> 04:55.494
The shitty thing is...

04:56.729 --> 04:59.498
it's a routine I'm getting
a little too used to.

05:02.435 --> 05:04.836
I don't have a fucking clue
what happened.

05:06.773 --> 05:08.907
You know when we first
started off...

05:10.109 --> 05:12.144
everything was perfect.

05:14.681 --> 05:17.215
Then when she left yesterday...

05:17.217 --> 05:20.152
I knew there was nothing I
could do to change her mind.

05:22.021 --> 05:23.555
It's like she was just
stuck on it.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.991
Yeah but you can't
dwell on all that.

05:27.193 --> 05:31.096
Replaying all these
conversations in your head...

05:31.098 --> 05:32.964
wondering...

05:33.733 --> 05:35.767
it'll drive you crazy.

05:35.769 --> 05:38.136
You remember how it was
with me and Alma?

05:38.138 --> 05:40.539
It took me almost a year
to get back to normal.

05:41.841 --> 05:44.609
Yeah but that whole thing was
fucked from the start.

05:50.950 --> 05:52.417
Yeah, probably.

05:54.887 --> 05:56.988
So what're you gonna do
with this place?

05:56.990 --> 06:00.092
Well, I spoke to the owner
this morning.

06:00.094 --> 06:03.929
I'll stay the weekend and see if he
can find someone else to rent it.

06:03.931 --> 06:05.297
Why not stick around for a bit?

06:05.299 --> 06:07.599
You still have
the photo assignment.

06:07.601 --> 06:10.302
I'd rather stay in town,
commute from there.

06:10.304 --> 06:12.938
Just make a few day trips
and get the photos that way.

06:12.940 --> 06:15.507
It would be much easier
to do it just from here.

06:17.110 --> 06:18.744
I don't know...

06:20.546 --> 06:22.914
I wouldn't really
be able to concentrate.

It depends on a few
different things actually.

22:19.472 --> 22:22.139
It's no the worst place
to end up.

22:22.141 --> 22:23.941
How're you enjoying yourself,
David?

22:23.943 --> 22:26.811
- He's bored sick.
- No, no. This is great.

22:26.813 --> 22:28.879
I'm glad I decided
to go shooting today.

22:28.881 --> 22:30.681
Otherwise I wouldn't
have met Marie.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.450
Well, that makes the both of us.

22:33.251 --> 22:35.019
Why don't I show you around?

22:39.257 --> 22:43.594
Marie is always the one in charge
of these little house parties,

22:43.596 --> 22:46.130
if you couldn't guess
by the crowd out there.

22:54.306 --> 22:56.807
I always feel so out of place
with her friends.

22:56.809 --> 22:59.510
It's not that I mind their age,
but...

22:59.512 --> 23:01.946
they can be
a fucking superficial lot.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.882
Though I must say,

23:04.884 --> 23:07.284
I saw a bit of a kindred spirit
in you.

23:07.286 --> 23:09.186
"Kindred spirits?"

23:09.188 --> 23:10.788
Is that sort of like
love at first sight?

23:12.691 --> 23:14.692
Marie tells me
that you're a photographer.

23:14.694 --> 23:18.429
Yeah, well it's created a lot
of great opportunities for me.

23:18.431 --> 23:20.998
Is that how you ended up
in Iceland?

23:21.000 --> 23:24.101
Well partly.
I do most of my work in Europe.

23:24.103 --> 23:26.270
I do a bit
of photography myself.

23:28.173 --> 23:30.341
I started when I was in college.

23:32.511 --> 23:34.812
It was a particularly
happy time in my life

23:34.814 --> 23:38.816
so I became obsessed
with documenting it all.

23:49.795 --> 23:51.829
These are actually really good.

23:53.231 --> 23:55.599
It's just a few of my favorites
of my own work.

23:57.536 --> 23:59.370
I've collected
thousands of prints.

23:59.372 --> 24:01.505
Each marked off by category.

24:06.812 --> 24:08.579
That's from when we met.

24:10.549 --> 24:12.249
She's beautiful.

24:14.352 --> 24:17.488
That's what makes her
so unreachable.

24:18.523 --> 24:19.824
What do you mean?

24:20.692 --> 24:22.560
Marie, like most
beautiful women,

24:22.562 --> 24:25.262
is very self-aware.

24:26.264 --> 24:29.333
Women like her, they have
the power to dominate.

24:29.335 --> 24:33.838
Each whim answered.
Each affection celebrated.

24:33.840 --> 24:36.040
I've known women like that.

24:38.510 --> 24:40.144
I do love her.

24:41.246 --> 24:42.746
Deeply.

24:44.082 --> 24:46.417
That's the worst part
of it all, I think.

24:51.256 --> 24:53.624
You know, there was a drowning
here last week.

24:53.626 --> 24:55.493
Though from what I'm hearing,
it seems...

24:55.495 --> 24:57.461
more like it was a suicide.

24:58.396 --> 25:00.130
I was there...

25:00.132 --> 25:01.332
What?

25:01.334 --> 25:02.900
Well, not when it happened.

25:02.902 --> 25:04.702
I'm the one who found her.

25:04.704 --> 25:05.769
Christ.

25:05.771 --> 25:09.840
- I didn't really want to mention it out there.
- No, of course.

25:09.842 --> 25:12.109
That's a terrible thing
to have to go through.

25:12.111 --> 25:13.978
Did you know the woman who died?

25:15.080 --> 25:16.580
Elisa?

25:17.115 --> 25:19.550
No, not in any real way.

25:19.552 --> 25:21.585
I had met her a few times.

25:22.287 --> 25:23.787
Tragic woman, really.

25:24.789 --> 25:28.592
That much I could sense
even before she died.

25:28.594 --> 25:30.394
Well it was a suicide.

25:31.763 --> 25:35.399
The police have asked me to stay
until they finish the investigation.

25:35.401 --> 25:37.167
Or at least that's
what they told me.

25:37.169 --> 25:39.003
It makes sense.

25:39.005 --> 25:40.504
I wouldn't stress about it.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.807
So what are you doing
after the season?

25:43.809 --> 25:45.109
Going back to Reykjavik?

25:45.111 --> 25:48.879
No, I'll probably go
for a holiday soon.

25:48.881 --> 25:52.016
You're always off somewhere.
Don't you get sick of it?

25:52.018 --> 25:53.717
Oh god, no, no.

25:53.719 --> 25:55.119
And anyway, I promised my sister

25:55.121 --> 25:57.421
to go back to Rome
for a few weeks.

25:57.423 --> 26:01.392
And Jóhann can take
that much time off?

26:01.394 --> 26:03.561
Jóhann won't be joining me.

26:03.563 --> 26:06.330
We need a little break from
each other every now and then.

26:06.332 --> 26:08.666
It's the only way it works
with us.

26:21.213 --> 26:23.714
Hey, where did you disappear to?

26:23.716 --> 26:25.416
Jóhann was just
showing me around.

26:25.418 --> 26:26.750
You've got a beautiful home.

26:26.752 --> 26:29.687
I'm really glad he likes you.

26:29.689 --> 26:32.189
He typically doesn't like
any of my friends.

26:32.191 --> 26:33.757
What about me?

26:33.759 --> 26:35.326
Oh, he loves you.

26:35.328 --> 26:37.661
But then, so does everybody.

26:39.831 --> 26:41.131
Isn't she such a beauty?

26:42.334 --> 26:44.702
You know, it's sort of
a strange phenomenon, actually.

26:44.704 --> 26:46.804
- In what sense?
- Well think about it.

26:46.806 --> 26:49.473
Most relationships, outside
of family, are transient.

26:49.475 --> 26:51.775
Oh, I don't believe that.

26:51.777 --> 26:54.812
How many actual relationships have
you maintained throughout your life?

26:54.814 --> 26:58.315
And I'm not just talking about people
you email with every now and then.

26:58.317 --> 27:02.119
But I don't get this notion
of relationships.

27:02.121 --> 27:03.354
When you're friends
with someone,

27:03.356 --> 27:05.189
you don't have to be in
constant contact with them.

27:05.191 --> 27:08.258
It's more just knowing they're
out there when you need them.

27:08.260 --> 27:10.260
But then what does
that friendship amount to?

27:10.262 --> 27:11.729
It's so trivial.

27:11.731 --> 27:15.833
David, I think you're a bit
too attached to people.

27:15.835 --> 27:18.268
Maybe you expect too much.

27:18.270 --> 27:19.770
You're probably right.

27:20.772 --> 27:22.973
I do tend to think
about other people too much.

27:22.975 --> 27:26.343
And what about them?
Are they thinking about you?

27:59.978 --> 28:01.178
The woman on the news.

28:01.180 --> 28:04.181
The one they found on the beach.

28:04.183 --> 28:06.717
Did you two happen to know her?

28:06.719 --> 28:08.485
Must've seen her around.

28:22.367 --> 28:24.034
Excuse me.

28:29.140 --> 28:31.208
Horrible way to go.

28:31.210 --> 28:32.576
Yeah.

28:46.624 --> 28:48.125
You all right?

28:54.032 --> 28:57.034
When you called I was a bit
confused, to be honest.

28:59.270 --> 29:01.071
Confused about what?

29:02.440 --> 29:04.408
I've heard stories, you know...

29:05.310 --> 29:06.977
back in Reykjavik.

29:08.980 --> 29:10.714
What stories?

29:13.585 --> 29:15.185
Don't play dumb.

29:19.691 --> 29:21.191
Okay...

29:21.726 --> 29:23.627
you heard stories.

29:26.965 --> 29:29.266
I'm sorry about that...

29:29.268 --> 29:31.568
but I don't really know
what you expect from me.

29:37.142 --> 29:38.742
Nothing...

29:40.912 --> 29:42.579
Nothing...

29:49.120 --> 29:53.056
You know, it took us
almost two hours to get here.

29:53.058 --> 29:56.226

No. Not yet.

did you get a chance to speak

39:04.443 --> 39:06.976
Yeah... I mean, for a bit.

39:06.978 --> 39:10.814
She... she was busy
playing host.

39:10.816 --> 39:12.382
Why?

39:12.384 --> 39:14.684
She hasn't been herself lately.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.186
What do you mean?

39:16.787 --> 39:18.755
It's been tough on her,

39:18.757 --> 39:20.790
being away from Rome.

39:20.792 --> 39:23.626
When we're in the city,
she's not as restless,

39:23.628 --> 39:26.763
but out here she doesn't seem
to be handling it very well.

39:26.765 --> 39:29.332
It's gotta be hard,
living as a foreigner out here.

39:30.634 --> 39:32.702
Not everyone's suited

39:32.704 --> 39:34.671
Part of the reason we spend
so much time out here

39:34.673 --> 39:37.874
is because of all
the distractions in Reykjavik.

39:37.876 --> 39:39.943
It's a decent compromise,
I think.

39:39.945 --> 39:43.246
Especially given the amount
of freedom I give her.

39:43.248 --> 39:47.517

of the day on the phone...

39:47.519 --> 39:49.853

39:53.291 --> 39:54.791
Ever.

39:54.793 --> 39:55.925
You don't ask.

45:32.397 --> 45:35.798
We met in Reykjavik, a year ago,

45:35.800 --> 45:37.800
after she married Jóhann.

45:37.802 --> 45:40.470
They have a house there as well.

45:40.472 --> 45:42.238
Her and Jóhann...

45:43.841 --> 45:46.909
Seems like
kind of an odd pairing.

45:46.911 --> 45:48.711
Why?

45:50.114 --> 45:51.481
Because of his age?

45:51.483 --> 45:53.416
No, no, it's just...

45:54.651 --> 45:57.453
Look at the way
she was at the party.

45:57.455 --> 45:59.288
They barely even spoke.

46:00.390 --> 46:02.191
That's how she is.

46:03.360 --> 46:05.428
Jóhann's always there
to give her attention.

46:05.430 --> 46:08.197
Why not get it from others
when they're around?

46:09.266 --> 46:11.234
That seems selfish.

46:11.935 --> 46:13.603
That's because it is.

46:17.107 --> 46:22.311
Marie has a hard time seeing things
from other people's perspective.

46:22.313 --> 46:24.914
I'm sure it's tough on Jóhann.

46:24.916 --> 46:26.449
It would be for anyone.

46:27.484 --> 46:30.019
And that doesn't affect
your view on her at all?

46:30.021 --> 46:33.523
She's my friend and I really
don't wish to judge.

46:33.525 --> 46:35.758
I find that so boring.

46:35.760 --> 46:37.994
Well I guess there
is something about her...

46:39.596 --> 46:41.164
draws you in...

46:42.266 --> 46:44.000
If you're so curious
about Marie,

46:44.002 --> 46:46.335
then why don't you
go over there?

46:48.038 --> 46:49.906
She's probably still awake.

46:52.209 --> 46:53.776
Don't do that.

46:55.345 --> 46:56.779
What?

46:59.683 --> 47:02.952
So quick to assume trouble.

47:02.954 --> 47:04.687
So quick...

47:05.489 --> 47:08.791
Blame it on bad experiences,
I guess.

47:10.060 --> 47:13.062
And the fact that I can
never say what I'm thinking.

47:13.064 --> 47:14.697
That's a problem.

47:15.666 --> 47:17.834
Maybe you should talk
to someone about that.

47:19.269 --> 47:21.237
Isn't that what we're doing now?

47:39.389 --> 47:42.425
You know I really do love
how quiet it is out here.

47:43.961 --> 47:46.295
So much more peaceful
than the city.

47:50.934 --> 47:53.069
I'd like to have
a place like this.

47:56.473 --> 47:58.941
You'd still have to hold
on to your place in the city.

48:02.479 --> 48:03.946
Why's that?

48:05.249 --> 48:07.216
Because you'd get lonely.

48:12.222 --> 48:14.357
You seem to be doing all right.

48:16.093 --> 48:17.393
For now...

48:33.677 --> 48:35.645
I have to go away for a while.

48:38.215 --> 48:39.949
I got a call form Vienna.

48:41.518 --> 48:43.152
Paul's in the hospital.

48:43.754 --> 48:45.321
The hospital?

48:49.993 --> 48:51.527
He's gotten worse.

48:52.062 --> 48:53.729
They're not sure...

49:02.005 --> 49:04.073
It's just best
that I go see him.

49:05.309 --> 49:06.642
I fly out tomorrow.

49:06.644 --> 49:08.544
He's been a good friend to you.

49:09.880 --> 49:12.315
It'll be good for you
to see him.

49:14.818 --> 49:17.253
How long will you be gone for?

49:17.255 --> 49:19.689
A few days... maybe a week.

49:21.925 --> 49:24.060
I was thinking that
you'd come with me...

49:32.569 --> 49:34.937
Wouldn't it be better
if you went alone?

49:36.840 --> 49:38.574
I don't see why it would.

49:39.443 --> 49:41.577
Unless you'd rather stay.

49:41.579 --> 49:43.179
Jóhann...

49:44.247 --> 49:46.916
I really think it would be
better if you went alone.

49:48.685 --> 49:51.253
You know I don't do well
with sickness.

49:59.429 --> 50:03.132
And you'll be fine...
Staying here alone?

50:03.134 --> 50:04.834
Don't worry about me.

50:05.969 --> 50:07.570
I'll be okay.

50:13.043 --> 50:15.644
You don't make it easy, do you?

50:17.014 --> 50:19.115
My sweet Marie...

52:04.054 --> 52:05.254
No.

52:46.997 --> 52:50.299
♪

53:23.868 --> 53:25.768
So he just called you?

53:26.503 --> 53:28.270
What's so bad about that?

53:29.105 --> 53:31.173
He didn't play any games.

53:31.175 --> 53:33.609
He just said what he wanted
out front.

53:33.611 --> 53:38.514
And I must say,
he can be quite charming.

53:38.516 --> 53:40.082
Charming?

53:40.084 --> 53:43.085
Or maybe not charming, but
there's something about him.

53:43.087 --> 53:45.521
Of course. He's American.

53:45.523 --> 53:47.923
No, it's not just that.

53:49.059 --> 53:51.727
You can just tell there's
more to him than he lets on.

53:51.729 --> 53:53.729
I find that attractive.

53:53.731 --> 53:56.832
So many guys are just concerned
about themselves,

53:56.834 --> 53:59.101
even when they're fucking.

53:59.103 --> 54:00.569
Was he a good fuck?

54:01.938 --> 54:06.175
You know what the best way is to
tell if a guy will be good in bed?

54:06.177 --> 54:07.610
What?

54:08.545 --> 54:10.479
Just see what makes him laugh.

54:16.519 --> 54:19.121
What's that?

54:21.891 --> 54:23.492
I don't know.

54:24.694 --> 54:26.862
It's different for us.

54:28.798 --> 54:30.733
You have so much
to look forward to

54:30.735 --> 54:33.002
for once you finish university.

54:34.304 --> 54:37.306
It's not gonna be so easy
for me, you know.

54:37.308 --> 54:39.008
Still...

54:39.010 --> 54:42.978
I wouldn't mind to struggle if I
knew it was leading somewhere.

54:47.717 --> 54:50.352
I didn't try hard enough
when I was younger.

54:51.454 --> 54:53.689
I was too distracted...

54:54.424 --> 54:56.492
always jumping to new things.

54:58.028 --> 55:01.063
But... just think about
how happy you are

55:01.065 --> 55:02.798
compared to other people.

55:03.833 --> 55:08.203
You can work hard
and try to do everything right,

55:08.205 --> 55:11.674
and things will still
not work out.

55:11.676 --> 55:14.310
But that's such a sad outlook
to have.

55:17.914 --> 55:19.782
I don't want to think like that.

56:19.542 --> 56:21.243
Liv.

56:21.245 --> 56:23.379
Liv, are you awake?

56:25.148 --> 56:26.715
Yes.

56:27.384 --> 56:28.817
I was thinking.

56:29.919 --> 56:33.088
When I come back from Rome,
we should go somewhere.

56:34.524 --> 56:37.192
- What?
- Just us.

56:37.194 --> 56:39.895
Maybe to America.
Maybe somewhere else.

56:39.897 --> 56:41.697
I don't know.

56:41.699 --> 56:42.965
What for?

56:42.967 --> 56:45.367
So we can
have holidays together.

56:48.004 --> 56:50.806
I can't just take
a holiday from work, Marie.

56:50.808 --> 56:52.441
Why not?

56:52.443 --> 56:54.877
Because they don't allow it.

57:02.552 --> 57:05.087
You mean you wouldn't take
a holiday with me?

57:06.389 --> 57:09.525
Of course I would, I just can't.

57:09.527 --> 57:11.226
Not now.

57:11.661 --> 57:13.262
But why?

57:13.264 --> 57:14.563
I just told you.

57:18.134 --> 57:20.335
There's nothing for me here.

57:22.972 --> 57:26.675
I can't bear the thought
of being here forever.

57:26.677 --> 57:28.777
But it won't be forever.

57:31.114 --> 57:33.749
You'll go back to Reykjavik
at the end of the season.

57:33.751 --> 57:35.951
I don't mean this house.
I mean...

57:41.991 --> 57:43.859
I wish you wouldn't leave.

57:45.295 --> 57:47.729
I can't bear this house alone.

57:47.731 --> 57:49.765
Talk to Jóhann.

57:49.767 --> 57:51.800
Tell him how you feel.

57:53.436 --> 57:57.539
I don't understand why you stay
with him if you're unhappy.

57:57.541 --> 57:59.842
The problem is not with Jóhann.

58:01.845 --> 58:03.745
The problem is with me.

58:06.416 --> 58:08.851
Even if it was someone else...

58:10.520 --> 58:12.588
I would still be like this.

58:18.461 --> 58:20.629
Let's just go away for a while.

58:22.465 --> 58:24.032
Marie...

58:25.268 --> 58:27.903
I can't.
- But why?

58:32.475 --> 58:34.776
Because...

58:40.416 --> 58:42.417
we're not children anymore.

58:54.397 --> 58:55.998
I don't know if he told you,

58:56.000 --> 58:58.767
but Johann's out of town
for the week

58:58.769 --> 59:02.271
and I'm bored to tears
back home.

59:07.410 --> 59:09.545
Oh, I didn't tell you.

59:09.547 --> 59:11.547
Liv came over last night.

59:13.082 --> 59:15.250
I had a feeling that'd come up.

59:15.252 --> 59:17.419
I just figured that you...
- it's okay.

59:17.421 --> 59:20.822
You made a good impression.
And she's hard to please.

59:23.793 --> 59:24.860
Finally...

59:24.862 --> 59:28.730
someone has something nice
to say about me for a change.

59:31.134 --> 59:34.670
I was on holiday in Santorini
with my family.

59:34.672 --> 59:36.204
I was still only twenty,

59:36.206 --> 59:40.175
and he was this handsome,
successful guy.

59:40.177 --> 59:42.744
And charming, so charming.

59:44.180 --> 59:46.515
That was the thing with Jóhann,

59:46.517 --> 59:51.887
he would make you feel like you were the
most interesting person in the room.

59:51.889 --> 59:53.221
So you've been with him
since then?

59:53.223 --> 59:54.890
No, no.

59:54.892 --> 59:56.758
We didn't end up
seeing each other

59:56.760 --> 59:59.828
for a few years after that.

59:59.830 --> 01:00:02.331
And at first,
I was so heartbroken.

01:00:03.633 --> 01:00:06.935
You know, when I thought of him,
I would have tears in my eyes.

01:00:08.471 --> 01:00:11.506
And I never felt like that
with any other guy.

01:00:13.142 --> 01:00:18.180
But then a year ago,
he was in Rome and we knew.

01:00:18.182 --> 01:00:21.450
So six months later
we were married.

01:00:22.518 --> 01:00:23.885
That's quick.

01:00:23.887 --> 01:00:25.587
You think so?

01:00:26.422 --> 01:00:29.524
I never understood
waiting so long.

01:00:29.526 --> 01:00:30.692
Once you know, you know.

01:00:30.694 --> 01:00:35.764
The reason you have to give it
time is because things change.

01:00:35.766 --> 01:00:37.299
People change.

01:00:52.849 --> 01:00:55.083
Why didn't we do this sooner?

01:00:55.085 --> 01:00:56.585
What do you mean?

01:00:57.353 --> 01:00:59.454
This. Dinner.

01:00:59.456 --> 01:01:01.890
But you were over
for the party, no?

01:01:01.892 --> 01:01:04.493
Yeah, but I barely
got to speak to you.

01:01:05.395 --> 01:01:07.396
You seemed...

01:01:08.297 --> 01:01:09.831
preoccupied.

01:01:13.936 --> 01:01:15.771
That was a strange night...

01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:19.941
Jóhann and I were a bit off
that day.

01:01:27.083 --> 01:01:28.750
That's all it was?

01:01:31.554 --> 01:01:34.189
I'm not sure what
you're referring to, David.

01:01:38.795 --> 01:01:40.162
Go ahead.

01:01:47.837 --> 01:01:49.838
When I mentioned Liv earlier...

01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:53.108
did you feel embarrassed?

01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:56.411
Why would I feel embarrassed?

01:02:02.318 --> 01:02:04.019
Just...

01:02:04.787 --> 01:02:07.355
well, with me coming to see you.

01:02:07.357 --> 01:02:10.459
Maybe you thought that might
change my opinion of you.

01:02:14.163 --> 01:02:16.898
I'm not sure what
you're referring to, Marie.

01:02:34.050 --> 01:02:36.651
This wine
is putting me to sleep.

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:40.222
Do you mind if I just nap
for a bit?

01:02:40.224 --> 01:02:42.524
Sure. You can take the bed
if you want.

01:02:42.526 --> 01:02:45.193
Oh, no, no, no.
The couch is okay.

01:02:46.896 --> 01:02:49.865
Are you sure I'm not disturbing?

01:02:49.867 --> 01:02:51.133
Of course.

Why're you always

You say one thing...

01:05:28.091 --> 01:05:29.658
you do another.

01:05:32.828 --> 01:05:35.897
You must see the world
differently than the rest of us.

01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:40.936
You see how ugly it is.

I don't know
why I'm feeling like this.

01:08:44.086 --> 01:08:46.621
For no reason.
It just comes.

01:08:49.725 --> 01:08:51.359
Always it's like this.

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:54.496
Melancholia.

01:08:56.732 --> 01:08:57.966
What?

01:08:59.001 --> 01:09:00.734
That's the word for it.

01:09:14.383 --> 01:09:17.919
There was a boy, Francois...

01:09:19.054 --> 01:09:21.022
This was when I was 15.

01:09:21.024 --> 01:09:23.758
He was a bit older, 19 or so.

01:09:24.792 --> 01:09:26.861
But we were so in love.

01:09:28.596 --> 01:09:30.999
When I met him,
I thought I would marry him.

01:09:31.001 --> 01:09:33.768
Have a family with him.

01:09:33.770 --> 01:09:36.671
And all this, I felt so quickly.

01:09:36.673 --> 01:09:39.006
When I was young,
I would always be like this.

01:09:39.009 --> 01:09:41.475
Getting attached so easily.

01:09:42.211 --> 01:09:44.112
But with Francois...

01:09:45.046 --> 01:09:47.649
I really thought
he was the one for me.

01:09:47.651 --> 01:09:49.149
So what happened?

01:09:49.885 --> 01:09:52.287
Right when we started dating,

01:09:52.288 --> 01:09:53.854
we fucked...

01:09:54.523 --> 01:09:56.457
and I didn't like it.

01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:58.893
It wasn't good for me.

01:10:00.329 --> 01:10:03.331
And so after that,
I stopped talking to him.

01:10:04.833 --> 01:10:09.003
And he would call and call...

01:10:09.005 --> 01:10:11.172
but for weeks I wouldn't answer.

01:10:12.808 --> 01:10:18.079
But then after that, I felt bad, so
I met him at his friend's house.

01:10:18.081 --> 01:10:21.115
I told him the truth,
and he couldn't believe it.

01:10:24.286 --> 01:10:25.954
My god...

01:10:27.423 --> 01:10:29.824
I still remember
the look on his face.

01:10:33.562 --> 01:10:35.663
He was so in love with me...

01:10:39.835 --> 01:10:41.936
he asked me for a second chance,

01:10:41.938 --> 01:10:43.805
but I didn't want to.

01:10:43.807 --> 01:10:46.174
After the first time, I knew.

01:10:46.176 --> 01:10:49.077
I think you should've have
given him a second chance.

01:10:49.079 --> 01:10:50.712
But I didn't want him anymore.

01:10:51.914 --> 01:10:55.416
I just would've hurt him even
more if we stayed together.

01:10:55.418 --> 01:10:58.553
You said you've made
a lot of mistakes with guys.

01:10:58.555 --> 01:11:00.121
So many...

01:11:01.023 --> 01:11:02.690
When those happened...

01:11:02.692 --> 01:11:06.794
did you ever think
about the guys you said no to?

01:11:06.796 --> 01:11:08.096
The guys like Francois?

01:11:10.332 --> 01:11:11.899
I mean...

01:11:11.901 --> 01:11:15.303
you break the guy's heart,
reject him,

01:11:15.305 --> 01:11:18.840
and then you go slumming it
with some random guy.

01:11:18.842 --> 01:11:20.108
That's a bit cruel, isn't it?

01:11:31.086 --> 01:11:33.087
Not shocking...

01:11:34.523 --> 01:11:36.691
Maybe a bit disappointing.

01:11:36.693 --> 01:11:38.559
Why is it the same?

01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:42.430
Every guy is the fucking same.

01:11:42.432 --> 01:11:45.133
You find out who I am
and all you can do is judge.

01:11:45.135 --> 01:11:46.901
I'm not judging.

01:11:46.903 --> 01:11:48.970
I just don't think you should just
put out to every guy who asks.

01:11:48.972 --> 01:11:50.805
I'm not like that, David,

01:11:50.807 --> 01:11:53.007
so don't fucking say it.

01:11:53.009 --> 01:11:54.542
Is that right?

01:12:05.621 --> 01:12:07.755
Don't.

01:12:07.757 --> 01:12:11.826
What, you're afraid I'll show
the pictures to Jóhann?

01:12:14.196 --> 01:12:16.497
Oh, so maybe you do
have a conscience.

01:12:16.499 --> 01:12:19.000
If you keep acting like this,
I'm going to go, David,

01:12:19.002 --> 01:12:21.269
and I won't come back.
I promise you that.

01:12:25.107 --> 01:12:27.642
You have a short temper, Marie.

01:12:27.644 --> 01:12:29.744
Has anyone ever told you that?

01:12:34.383 --> 01:12:36.851
Jóhann is coming back tomorrow.

01:12:38.087 --> 01:12:40.455
It's going to be harder
to see you.

01:12:42.758 --> 01:12:44.192
I know.

01:12:45.427 --> 01:12:47.695
How much longer
are you staying for?

01:12:49.832 --> 01:12:51.532
A week...

01:12:53.535 --> 01:12:55.370
Maybe a bit longer.

01:12:56.572 --> 01:12:58.606
So we've still got time.

01:13:03.912 --> 01:13:06.381
I know you won't believe me,
but...

01:13:07.883 --> 01:13:10.451
I will be sad to see you go.

01:13:11.553 --> 01:13:14.188
The past few days
have been really great.

01:13:28.036 --> 01:13:29.704
Never.

01:13:32.841 --> 01:13:35.576
Then let's just enjoy the time
we have left.

01:14:05.374 --> 01:14:07.175
<i>Amore mio.</i>

01:14:07.976 --> 01:14:09.877
I've missed you so much.

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:24.725
Marie.

01:14:32.067 --> 01:14:34.168
Paul was in such bad shape.

01:14:35.437 --> 01:14:36.838
When I went to see him

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:39.841
he had all these tubes
hooked into him.

01:14:39.843 --> 01:14:43.377
Apparatuses allowing him
to breath.

01:14:43.379 --> 01:14:45.279
Did he know you were there?

01:14:47.049 --> 01:14:48.783
Yes, yes.

01:14:50.786 --> 01:14:54.088
They woke him up eventually
and we spoke.

01:14:54.090 --> 01:14:55.790
What did he say?

01:14:55.792 --> 01:14:57.525
Nothing meaningful.

01:14:58.927 --> 01:15:01.362
I don't think he knew
who I was, to be honest.

01:15:03.432 --> 01:15:06.300
But that wasn't
the upsetting part.

01:15:06.302 --> 01:15:09.470
That night,
when I got back to the hotel,

01:15:09.472 --> 01:15:11.405
I kept thinking about him.

01:15:12.107 --> 01:15:13.941
All the people we knew.

01:15:13.943 --> 01:15:16.143
The time we spent together.

01:15:19.047 --> 01:15:20.915
He didn't remember any of it.

01:15:22.150 --> 01:15:24.185
It was like it never happened.

01:15:27.689 --> 01:15:29.857
And I started to weep.

01:15:30.926 --> 01:15:32.660
Like some child.

01:15:34.963 --> 01:15:36.631
I didn't know why.

01:15:49.878 --> 01:15:51.879
So strange isn't it?

01:15:53.081 --> 01:15:54.749
There I was,

01:15:54.751 --> 01:15:58.753
filled with
this unbearable sadness.

01:16:00.722 --> 01:16:03.124
Don't dwell on it, my love.

01:16:26.315 --> 01:16:28.149
I wish you'd come by more.

01:16:32.354 --> 01:16:35.289
I haven't seen you
since he came back.

01:16:35.291 --> 01:16:37.425
I told you
it would be difficult.

01:16:40.262 --> 01:16:42.163
I know, it's just...

01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:47.568
I think about how it was...

01:16:48.604 --> 01:16:50.071
things you said.

01:16:51.506 --> 01:16:53.774
That was only a week ago, Marie.

01:16:57.412 --> 01:16:59.480
Has it really changed that much?

01:17:00.716 --> 01:17:02.617
I wish you wouldn't
be like this...

01:17:04.753 --> 01:17:07.521
You know what my situation is,
and...

01:17:08.357 --> 01:17:10.324
And, I never
promised you anything.

01:17:15.998 --> 01:17:19.166
You should try taking responsibility
for yourself some time.

01:17:21.036 --> 01:17:22.737
You say things...

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:26.574
maybe you mean them...

01:17:27.442 --> 01:17:29.076
maybe you don't.

01:17:33.181 --> 01:17:35.282
Why not just be clear about it?

01:17:38.587 --> 01:17:40.621
What's so hard about that?

01:17:58.707 --> 01:18:00.741
That's funny, coming from you.

01:18:04.913 --> 01:18:07.214
It's a joke, is what it is.

01:18:17.159 --> 01:18:19.627
♪

01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:26.033
Liv.

01:18:26.968 --> 01:18:28.936
Glass of wine.

01:18:31.807 --> 01:18:33.874
Everything's been going well.

01:18:33.876 --> 01:18:37.511
Finished up the assignment,
so that'll keep my agent happy.

01:18:37.513 --> 01:18:39.714
For now, at least.

01:18:39.716 --> 01:18:42.383
And you've been keeping
yourself entertained...

01:18:42.385 --> 01:18:44.051
otherwise?

01:18:45.822 --> 01:18:47.121
Look...

01:18:48.190 --> 01:18:51.759
I know I don't come out
looking too great here.

01:18:51.761 --> 01:18:53.427
I know you and Marie are close.

01:18:53.429 --> 01:18:55.663
Of course,
that doesn't bother her.

01:18:55.665 --> 01:18:56.997
It never has.

01:18:57.733 --> 01:18:59.734
She's not totally at fault here.

01:19:00.602 --> 01:19:02.870
At fault for what?

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:05.940
David...

01:19:06.942 --> 01:19:10.344
you're acting like you
did something wrong.

01:19:10.346 --> 01:19:13.314
I could see it being an issue
if we were teenagers.

01:19:16.218 --> 01:19:17.752
But we're not.

01:19:22.057 --> 01:19:23.624
I took it out this morning,

01:19:23.626 --> 01:19:25.392
going through old photos.

01:19:27.930 --> 01:19:30.564
Did you see Marie much
while I was gone?

01:19:31.633 --> 01:19:33.067
Marie?

01:19:33.069 --> 01:19:35.970
No, not really.

01:19:35.972 --> 01:19:38.072
I was busy
finishing up the photos.

01:19:40.342 --> 01:19:42.443
I've noticed a huge change
in her.

01:19:44.146 --> 01:19:46.280
She seems to be coming to life.

01:19:47.315 --> 01:19:49.083
I'm glad to hear that.

01:19:57.359 --> 01:19:58.893
You took this.

01:20:00.595 --> 01:20:02.396
That's how I knew her.

01:20:02.398 --> 01:20:05.032
I photographed her
about a year ago.

01:20:06.601 --> 01:20:07.935
I thought...

01:20:11.106 --> 01:20:14.842
You know I... got this photo
from the police.

01:20:14.844 --> 01:20:16.744
They said she had it
in her house.

01:20:16.746 --> 01:20:18.412
That's right...

01:20:18.414 --> 01:20:21.582
I remember you mentioning
something about a portrait.

01:20:21.584 --> 01:20:23.517
I didn't make the connection.

01:20:26.988 --> 01:20:29.156
Such a sad thing she was.

01:20:36.631 --> 01:20:39.667
One of those kind of nights,
hey?

01:20:39.669 --> 01:20:41.202
What?

01:20:41.204 --> 01:20:43.337
You know David, I was thinking
about what you said

01:20:43.339 --> 01:20:45.172
the other day, you know,

01:20:45.174 --> 01:20:47.107
and I think
it's quite interesting

01:20:47.109 --> 01:20:50.444
about how you put it,
relationships being transient,

01:20:50.446 --> 01:20:54.748
and when I came home, I started
thinking about my response,

01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:57.084
and I realized, David, I wasn't
quite honest with myself...

01:20:57.086 --> 01:20:58.919
Sorry, I'll be right back.

01:21:02.157 --> 01:21:03.624
Can I talk to you for a second?

01:21:03.626 --> 01:21:06.493
Sure, but Alex was just
telling me about this hotel

01:21:06.495 --> 01:21:09.597
he's working on in Berlin
and it really sounds amazing.

01:21:09.599 --> 01:21:11.398
Well, it's still a while off

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:13.267
but we've got high hopes for it.

01:21:13.269 --> 01:21:15.102
Can we go,
maybe have a cigarette?

01:21:15.104 --> 01:21:20.441
Can it wait 'til after dinner? I just
didn't get a chance to talk to everybody.

01:21:20.443 --> 01:21:23.244
Sure, okay, that's fine.

01:22:09.357 --> 01:22:10.658
Hey, man.

01:22:18.533 --> 01:22:20.301
I'm stuffed.

01:22:20.303 --> 01:22:22.603
I always love a cigarette
after dinner.

01:22:22.605 --> 01:22:24.571
Cleans the palette.

01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:31.812
So Liv was telling me
she came out to see you.

01:22:33.481 --> 01:22:36.183
Yeah? She told you?

01:22:36.185 --> 01:22:37.851
I'm impressed.

01:22:39.688 --> 01:22:40.988
About what?

01:22:41.656 --> 01:22:43.757
It's nothing, it's just...

01:22:43.759 --> 01:22:46.760
I tried to get in her pants
a couple of times.

01:22:46.762 --> 01:22:48.329
She's a tough one.

01:22:49.431 --> 01:22:50.898
Not like Marie.

01:22:55.203 --> 01:22:57.204
Jóhann really is clueless.

01:22:58.273 --> 01:23:01.909
Marie does what she wants,
with whoever she wants.

01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:07.481
So you fucked her then?

01:23:09.718 --> 01:23:11.652
That's what you're saying,
right?

01:23:13.888 --> 01:23:16.457
That you fucked her.
- Hey, man.

01:23:16.459 --> 01:23:19.860
- Go on, say it!
- Hey man, what the fuck is your problem?

01:23:19.862 --> 01:23:22.062
Hey, hey, hey!
What the hell is going on?

01:23:22.064 --> 01:23:24.064
- This guy's fucking drunk!
- Fuck you.

01:23:24.066 --> 01:23:25.332
Okay, okay.
Enough guys.

01:23:25.334 --> 01:23:27.768
No one inside
has heard anything but...

01:23:27.770 --> 01:23:29.937
David, David!

01:24:33.735 --> 01:24:37.871
Sorry... I was just getting up.

01:24:41.109 --> 01:24:42.643
You don't look so well.

01:24:43.678 --> 01:24:45.112
Look...

01:24:45.647 --> 01:24:47.081
about last night...

01:24:47.982 --> 01:24:50.017
I'm sorry I went off like that.

01:24:50.019 --> 01:24:52.619
I never cared much for Alex...

01:24:52.621 --> 01:24:54.088
and anyways...

01:24:55.056 --> 01:24:56.757
he probably had it coming.

01:24:59.227 --> 01:25:01.061
But that's not why I'm here.

01:25:04.399 --> 01:25:06.166
I came by because...

01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:09.937
there's somewhere
I've been meaning to show you.

01:25:15.844 --> 01:25:17.611
When I was growing up...

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:21.482
I would go hunting
with my father.

01:25:21.484 --> 01:25:23.517
My grandfather too, sometimes.

01:25:24.886 --> 01:25:28.956
But now... it's illegal
to hunt the wildlife out here.

01:25:30.325 --> 01:25:33.827
So instead... I set up targets.

01:25:36.164 --> 01:25:38.699
For me, it was never
about killing the animal.

01:25:40.268 --> 01:25:43.437
I was a bit timid
when it came to that, anyway.

01:25:45.273 --> 01:25:49.443
I was more interested in just...
Being in the wilderness.

01:25:51.412 --> 01:25:55.549
It was one of the few occasions I
would get to be alone with my father,

01:25:55.551 --> 01:25:59.453
so I would spend my time
just paying attention to him.

01:26:01.856 --> 01:26:03.924
Seeing how he would act.

01:26:07.028 --> 01:26:08.829
My whole life,

01:26:08.831 --> 01:26:10.964
that man was a stranger to me.

01:26:12.333 --> 01:26:16.637
Most of what I know of him comes
from just observing him out here.

01:26:16.639 --> 01:26:18.705
It's a shame, really.

01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:31.852
I wasn't sure
about you and Marie, at first.

01:26:33.888 --> 01:26:35.756
I had my suspicions, of course.

01:26:36.891 --> 01:26:39.826
But it wasn't until last night
that I was certain.

01:26:41.162 --> 01:26:43.397
The way you lashed out
at Alex...

01:26:44.766 --> 01:26:47.401
I don't know
what you think you know...

01:26:47.403 --> 01:26:50.437
Please, David.
Don't insult me.

01:26:52.207 --> 01:26:53.540
What was it?

01:26:56.578 --> 01:26:58.645
Did she tell you
that you were special?

01:27:00.248 --> 01:27:02.516
That you're the only one
she can talk to?

01:27:02.518 --> 01:27:04.017
Be open with?

01:27:05.853 --> 01:27:07.354
You see...

01:27:08.623 --> 01:27:11.024
I know the kind
of girl Marie is.

01:27:11.026 --> 01:27:12.859
I've always known it.

01:27:13.928 --> 01:27:16.897
I'm not so vain
to think I could change her.

01:27:21.869 --> 01:27:25.339
But that doesn't mean
I love her any less.

01:27:25.341 --> 01:27:27.507
I didn't mean for it to happen
this way.

01:27:29.877 --> 01:27:32.079
It wasn't something I planned.

01:27:37.986 --> 01:27:40.153
I am sorry, Jóhann.

01:27:42.056 --> 01:27:43.690
If that means anything.

01:27:50.999 --> 01:27:52.532
I lied to you.

01:27:56.137 --> 01:27:57.237
What?

01:27:58.406 --> 01:28:00.707
Or, at least I didn't tell you
the whole truth.

01:28:03.444 --> 01:28:05.579
I was seeing Elisa, on and off,

01:28:05.581 --> 01:28:08.215
for the last two seasons
I've been out here.

01:28:08.217 --> 01:28:10.851
She had notions
of how things were...

01:28:11.919 --> 01:28:13.754
her place in my life...

01:28:15.123 --> 01:28:18.458
I knew that she was struggling
with depression.

01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:22.396
I even had a feeling that
something might happen to her,

01:28:22.398 --> 01:28:24.131
yet...

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:27.267
yet I did nothing.

01:28:28.636 --> 01:28:30.504
I felt a bit guilty at first...

01:28:31.205 --> 01:28:32.906
but then I realized...

01:28:33.975 --> 01:28:36.243
if I was being honest
with myself...

01:28:37.211 --> 01:28:39.746
I know that she never
meant anything to me.

01:28:42.317 --> 01:28:44.951
Just like you don't
mean anything to Marie.

01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:47.414
I just got everything packed in.

01:29:48.483 --> 01:29:50.484
So where are you headed to next?

01:29:50.486 --> 01:29:52.452
I have to go see the publisher
in London,

01:29:52.454 --> 01:29:54.421
then it's probably New York.

01:29:54.423 --> 01:29:56.089
I'm jealous.

01:30:01.662 --> 01:30:03.330
Look, David...

01:30:04.665 --> 01:30:07.300
I just wanted to say
that I'm sorry.

01:30:07.302 --> 01:30:09.102
About what?

01:30:09.104 --> 01:30:10.771
The other night...

01:30:11.672 --> 01:30:13.240
It's just...

01:30:14.308 --> 01:30:16.676
with everything
that happened last week...

01:30:17.845 --> 01:30:19.446
I wasn't being myself.

01:30:20.681 --> 01:30:22.716
And it wasn't fair to you,
I know.

01:30:23.651 --> 01:30:25.452
So those few days we had...

01:30:27.855 --> 01:30:29.189
it was nothing?

01:30:34.695 --> 01:30:36.563
You should just forget about me.

01:30:38.099 --> 01:30:39.900
Do you really want that?

01:30:44.605 --> 01:30:46.973
This whole thing...

01:30:46.975 --> 01:30:48.942
you and Jóhann, out here...

01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:54.147
I don't understand it.

01:31:00.655 --> 01:31:02.689
But what's there to say, right?

01:31:05.293 --> 01:31:07.494
It never makes sense
from the outside.

01:31:11.666 --> 01:31:14.301
If I asked you to get in
this car with me right now...

01:31:14.303 --> 01:31:16.102
what would you say to that?

01:31:17.338 --> 01:31:18.939
Things would be better.

01:31:22.276 --> 01:31:24.044
You know that's not true...

01:31:26.581 --> 01:31:28.415
We know each other now.

01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:30.851
We have to stop for the moment,

01:31:30.853 --> 01:31:33.286
but that doesn't mean
we can't try again.

01:31:33.288 --> 01:31:35.755
You're only a plane ride away...

01:31:35.757 --> 01:31:39.226
Come and go as you please,
right?

01:31:44.398 --> 01:31:47.234
I've never met anyone
as selfish as you.

01:31:51.706 --> 01:31:53.507
That's the problem.

01:31:55.810 --> 01:31:57.310
You don't know.

01:31:59.881 --> 01:32:02.315
I can't really speak
to the future.

01:32:03.551 --> 01:32:05.485
But when I make a choice...

01:32:06.954 --> 01:32:08.788
I usually stick to it.

01:32:13.895 --> 01:32:16.897
I think this'll be the last
time we see each other, Marie.

01:32:29.111 --> 01:32:32.145
♪

01:32:43.824 --> 01:32:45.559
Von Fleischer?

01:32:52.266 --> 01:32:55.168
I've booked us two tickets
to Madrid, for next week.

01:32:56.804 --> 01:32:59.706
I'm getting a bit sick
of Iceland for the moment.

01:33:01.375 --> 01:33:03.209
You read my mind.

01:33:07.582 --> 01:33:09.215
David left today.

01:33:10.985 --> 01:33:12.385
Is that right?

01:33:13.254 --> 01:33:16.823
I saw him this morning.
Said goodbye.

01:33:17.758 --> 01:33:19.659
You know, I quite liked him.

01:33:23.764 --> 01:33:25.298
Interesting guy.

01:33:32.373 --> 01:33:34.541
We've weathered some storms,
you and I.

01:33:35.610 --> 01:33:37.477
But we always make it through,
don't we?

01:33:42.717 --> 01:33:44.150
Why is that?

01:33:46.287 --> 01:33:47.854
You know why.

01:33:49.256 --> 01:33:51.024
I know...

01:33:51.026 --> 01:33:52.959
but I like hearing you say it.
