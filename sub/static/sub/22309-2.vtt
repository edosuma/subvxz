The chakram is primarily

However,
in close-quarter combat,

38:50.412 --> 38:53.496
sometimes throwing a weapon
is not an option.

38:53.540 --> 38:56.082
Trenton, you're up first.

This is designed
to be a handle, correct?

38:58.754 --> 38:59.919
Yes, sir.

38:59.963 --> 39:01.379
So in order
to keep myself safe,

39:01.423 --> 39:03.590
I'm gonna hold the handle,

39:03.633 --> 39:06.259
and I have to protect
the back of my arm with this.

that's a concern.
