WEBVTT

00:01.827 --> 00:03.046
PREVIOUSLY ON "THE 100"...

00:03.090 --> 00:04.526
CLARKE: EVERYONE LISTEN UP.

00:04.569 --> 00:05.570
LIFE AS WE KNOW IT
IS ABOUT TO END...AGAIN.

00:05.614 --> 00:10.488
VOICE: 3, 2, 1...

00:10.532 --> 00:12.012
BELLAMY:
IT'’S GONE, GUYS.

00:12.055 --> 00:13.230
RAVEN: JUST ONCE,
I'’D LIKE TO TAKE OFF

00:13.274 --> 00:14.536
FROM A PLANET
THAT WASN'’T ON FIRE.

00:14.579 --> 00:16.016
SHAW: IT WILL BE
AT LEAST 10 YEARS

00:16.059 --> 00:17.017
BEFORE THAT VALLEY
COMES BACK.

00:17.060 --> 00:18.931
CRYO IS THE ONLY OPTION.

00:18.975 --> 00:21.891
JORDAN: I'’M JORDAN,
MONTY AND HARPER'’S SON.

00:21.934 --> 00:23.023
HOW LONG WERE
WE ASLEEP?

00:23.066 --> 00:24.720
125 YEARS.

00:24.763 --> 00:26.678
HEY, BELLAMY.
HEY, CLARKE.

00:26.722 --> 00:28.898
WE WANTED HIM TO WAKE YOU
FIRST SO WE COULD TALK.

00:28.941 --> 00:31.031
EARTH ISN'’T COMING BACK.

00:31.074 --> 00:32.510
I'’M WORKING ON
A PLAN "B," THOUGH.

00:32.554 --> 00:34.164
IF YOU'’RE AWAKE,
THAT MEANS I FOUND IT.

00:34.208 --> 00:36.862
IT TOOK ME 30 YEARS,
BUT I FINALLY CRACKED

00:36.906 --> 00:38.516
THE ELIGIUS III
MISSION FILE.

00:38.560 --> 00:40.214
TURNS OUT, IT WASN'’T
A MINING MISSION.

00:40.257 --> 00:42.738
THEY WENT LOOKING
FOR ANOTHER PLANET.

01:18.774 --> 01:22.386
MONTY: CAN YOU SEE IT?
IS IT BEAUTIFUL?

01:22.430 --> 01:26.434
IT IS IN MY DREAMS.
I HOPE WE DO BETTER THERE.

01:26.477 --> 01:30.481
I HOPE YOUR LIVES THERE WILL BE
AS HAPPY AS MINE HAS BEEN.

01:30.525 --> 01:34.746
BE THE GOOD GUYS.
MAY WE MEET AGAIN.

01:34.790 --> 01:36.313
MAY WE
MEET AGAIN.

01:36.357 --> 01:38.010
MAY WE
MEET AGAIN.

01:44.495 --> 01:46.758
BELLAMY: I KNOW THIS
IS A LOT TO PROCESS.

01:46.802 --> 01:49.805
TAKE AN HOUR
AND MEET IN THE MESS.

01:49.848 --> 01:52.112
WE NEED
TO GAME THIS OUT.

01:52.155 --> 01:56.246
CLARKE: GUYS, WE SURVIVED.
MONTY MADE SURE OF IT.

01:56.290 --> 01:58.770
NOW WE GET OUR
HUMANITY BACK.

01:58.814 --> 02:01.556
SOME OF US
NEVER LOST IT.

02:08.519 --> 02:12.480
SHAW: RAVEN--
RAVEN, SLOW DOWN.

02:12.523 --> 02:15.961
ARE YOU OK?

02:16.005 --> 02:20.357
NO. I'’M NOT.
THEY LEFT US.

02:20.401 --> 02:23.795
THEY CHOSE
TO BE HAPPY.

02:23.839 --> 02:26.363
I DON'’T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
BUT SPENDING A LIFETIME

02:26.407 --> 02:29.801
ALONE WITH
SOMEONE YOU LOVE

02:29.845 --> 02:33.022
SOUNDS PRETTY
DAMN GOOD TO ME.

02:36.504 --> 02:39.333
NO MORE TALKING.

02:39.376 --> 02:41.639
MM...

02:41.683 --> 02:44.338
WHERE CAN WE GO?

02:44.381 --> 02:47.341
I HAVE A STATEROOM.

02:51.736 --> 02:54.174
DANGEROUS CURVES
AHEAD.

02:57.568 --> 02:59.527
DID YOU KNOW BECCA
DID THE CODING

02:59.570 --> 03:02.356
FOR THE ELIGIUS MISSIONS
WHEN SHE WAS ONLY 18?

03:02.399 --> 03:05.010
I MET HER ONCE
ON THE BRIDGE

03:05.054 --> 03:07.361
OF THE SHIP
THE DAY WE LAUNCHED.

03:07.404 --> 03:09.493
WHAT WAS SHE LIKE?

03:09.537 --> 03:12.366
SHE WAS LIKE YOU.

03:14.803 --> 03:15.847
YOU'’RE JUST
TRYING TO GET ME

03:15.891 --> 03:17.284
TO HAVE SEX
WITH YOU AGAIN.

03:20.243 --> 03:21.940
WHEN I TOOK
THE ELIGIUS RUN,

03:21.984 --> 03:23.899
EVERYONE THOUGHT
I WAS CRAZY--

03:23.942 --> 03:26.858
24 EARTH YEARS.

03:26.902 --> 03:29.774
IF THEY OFFERED IT
TO ME TODAY,

03:29.818 --> 03:33.691
I WOULDN'’T TAKE IT.

03:33.735 --> 03:37.652
YEP. THAT'’LL DO IT.

03:48.184 --> 03:50.578
BELLAMY: I'’M PRETTY SURE
THAT WILL NOT HELP.

03:50.621 --> 03:52.623
JORDAN: THERE YOU ARE.
CHECKING ON MADI?

03:52.667 --> 03:54.799
YEAH.

03:54.843 --> 03:57.759
MY DAD PRESERVED THIS
FOR WHEN WE WOKE UP.

03:57.802 --> 03:59.587
I'’M TOLD IT DOESN'T
TASTE VERY GOOD,

03:59.630 --> 04:02.372
BUT SINCE IT'’S ALL
I'’VE EVER EATEN--

04:02.416 --> 04:04.461
THANKS.

04:04.505 --> 04:08.770
YOUR MOM'’S NOT TOUCHING
HERS, BY THE WAY.

04:08.813 --> 04:11.425
SHE'’S WORRIED
ABOUT KANE.

04:11.468 --> 04:12.817
I'’LL GO TALK TO HER.

04:12.861 --> 04:15.167
KANE. I FORGOT.
UH, STAY HERE.

04:21.435 --> 04:23.263
BELLAMY: HEY, YOU
SEE RAVEN OR SHAW?

04:23.306 --> 04:25.308
EMORI: YOU KNOW,
THE PEOPLE YOU HANDED OVER

04:25.352 --> 04:27.005
TO OUR ENEMY
TO BE TORTURED.

04:27.049 --> 04:29.138
MURPHY: NOW, FOR CLARKE,
WE CALL THAT A TUESDAY.

04:29.181 --> 04:32.794
ECHO: EASY. SHE DID THE
RIGHT THING IN THE END.

04:32.837 --> 04:34.883
NO. I HAVEN'’T SEEN THEM.

04:38.669 --> 04:41.803
HEY...

04:41.846 --> 04:44.980
MOM, YOU'’VE
GOT TO EAT.

04:45.023 --> 04:47.287
IT COULD BE A WHILE BEFORE
WE FIND A FOOD SOURCE.

04:47.330 --> 04:49.332
WHAT I NEED IS
A SOURCE FOR PROPOFOL

04:49.376 --> 04:52.857
OR PENTOBARBITOL.

04:52.901 --> 04:56.339
JORDAN: WILL
FIRST-CULTURE ALGAE DO?

04:56.383 --> 05:00.778
MY DAD WANTED ME
TO GIVE THIS TO YOU.

05:00.822 --> 05:02.519
THE STUFF
BELLAMY USED ON OCTAVIA.

05:02.563 --> 05:04.304
EXACTLY.

05:04.347 --> 05:06.349
THE FIRST GENERATION
INDUCES COMA.

05:06.393 --> 05:08.612
HE WAS HOPING
YOU COULD USE IT

05:08.656 --> 05:10.658
TO SAVE KANE.

05:14.662 --> 05:17.055
THANK YOU.

05:17.099 --> 05:19.144
TAKE JACKSON
TO THE GROUND.

05:19.188 --> 05:21.799
I'’LL WAKE UP NIYLAH
TO ASSIST ME.

05:21.843 --> 05:23.453
RAVEN:
WHAT DID WE MISS?

05:23.497 --> 05:27.501
BELLAMY: NOTHING.
IT'’S ABOUT TIME. TAKE A SEAT.

05:27.544 --> 05:29.546
OK, EVERYONE.

05:29.590 --> 05:32.984
LISTEN UP.
HERE'’S WHAT WE KNOW.

05:33.028 --> 05:35.160
ELIGIUS III
WAS A COLONIZING MISSION.

05:35.204 --> 05:37.075
ACCORDING TO THE FILE,
THE MOTHERSHIP WENT

05:37.119 --> 05:39.991
TO 5 PLANETS THAT MET
NECESSARY CONDITIONS FOR LIFE,

05:40.035 --> 05:41.863
DROPPING MISSION TEAMS
ON EACH ONE.

05:41.906 --> 05:43.386
MONTY PICKED
PLANET ALPHA FOR US

05:43.430 --> 05:44.648
BECAUSE
IT'’S THE CLOSEST

05:44.692 --> 05:46.041
AND PROBABLY THE
MOST LIKE EARTH.

05:46.084 --> 05:48.173
WAS THERE
A "PROBABLY"?

05:48.217 --> 05:48.870
SHAW: WE HAVE TO ASSUME
THEY COULDN'’T KNOW FOR SURE

05:48.913 --> 05:50.741
UNTIL THEY GOT HERE.

05:50.785 --> 05:51.873
WE CAN SCAN THE ATMOSPHERE
FROM THE BRIDGE.

05:51.916 --> 05:53.091
JORDAN:
ACTUALLY, WE CANT.

05:53.135 --> 05:54.049
NONE OF THE
EQUIPMENT WE USED

05:54.092 --> 05:56.051
TO MONITOR EARTH
IS WORKING.

05:56.094 --> 05:58.488
I'’M GUESSING IT'S INTERFERENCE
FROM THE IONOSPHERE.

05:58.532 --> 06:00.055
BOTTOM LINE IS,
WE WON'’T KNOW

06:00.098 --> 06:01.839
IF IT'’S SURVIVABLE
UNTIL WE GET DOWN THERE.

06:01.883 --> 06:03.406
SOUNDS
FAMILIAR.

06:03.450 --> 06:04.668
WHAT ABOUT
RADIO SIGNALS?

06:04.712 --> 06:06.061
ANYTHING
FROM THE GROUND

06:06.104 --> 06:06.844
THAT SAYS THE MISSION
TEAM SURVIVED?

06:06.888 --> 06:08.411
NO RADIO SIGNALS.

06:08.455 --> 06:09.847
JORDAN: LIKELY ALSO
THE IONOSPHERE.

06:09.891 --> 06:11.022
THERE IS AN
ULTRA-HIGH-FREQUENCY PING

06:11.066 --> 06:12.894
ON RADAR, FAINT BUT--

06:12.937 --> 06:15.375
A RESCUE BEACON.
WE USED THEM ON ELIGIUS IV TO--

06:15.418 --> 06:16.680
GREAT. IF THERE'’S
A BEACON,

06:16.724 --> 06:18.203
THAT MEANS SOMEONE'’S
DOWN THERE, RIGHT?

06:18.247 --> 06:20.118
NOT NECESSARILY.
THEY'’RE SOLAR, SO--

06:20.162 --> 06:22.033
RAVEN: THEY CAN
LAST FOREVER.

06:22.077 --> 06:23.774
HOW LONG AGO DID
ELIGIUS III GET HERE?

06:23.818 --> 06:25.602
JORDAN: HARD TO TELL SINCE
THEY NEVER RADIOED BACK,

06:25.646 --> 06:28.779
BUT BEST ESTIMATE--
200 YEARS, GIVE OR TAKE.

06:28.823 --> 06:31.913
THAT'’S A LONG TIME
TO WAIT FOR A RESCUE.

06:34.829 --> 06:38.572
I TRUST MONTY.

06:38.615 --> 06:40.965
BELLAMY: GREAT.
THEN IT'’S SETTLED.

06:41.009 --> 06:43.098
WE LAND AT A DISTANCE,
GIVE US TIME TO ACCLIMATE.

06:43.141 --> 06:45.970
WE'’LL WAIT FOR THEM
TO COME TO US.

06:46.014 --> 06:47.885
LET'’S TALK
ABOUT GUNS.

06:47.929 --> 06:49.887
IF WE HAVE THEM,
WE'’LL USE THEM.

06:49.931 --> 06:52.412
WE'’RE TAKING GUNS.
WE'’RE ALSO TAKING NONLETHALS.

06:52.455 --> 06:54.239
NOW, ELIGIUS IV
HAD GAS GRENADES

06:54.283 --> 06:56.154
AND SHOCK BATONS
TO CONTROL THE CRIMINALS.

06:56.198 --> 06:58.113
WE WON'’T SHOOT FIRST
THIS TIME.

06:58.156 --> 07:00.115
IN THAT CASE, CLARKE
SHOULD STAY HERE.

07:00.158 --> 07:02.639
BELLAMY: RAVEN, YOU'’RE
THE ONE THAT'’S STAYING HERE.

07:02.683 --> 07:05.729
WHAT? LIKE HELL I AM.

07:05.773 --> 07:07.252
BELLAMY: LOOK.
WE CAN'’T TAKE BOTH OUR PILOTS,

07:07.296 --> 07:08.776
AND SINCE WE'’LL BE
FLYING BLIND UNTIL WE'’RE

07:08.819 --> 07:11.735
BELOW THE IONOSPHERE,
IT HAS TO BE SHAW.

07:11.779 --> 07:14.477
THAT'’S NOT ALL.
JORDAN, YOU'’RE STAYING, TOO.

07:14.521 --> 07:16.087
ME? WHY?

07:16.131 --> 07:17.567
CLARKE: I KNOW IT'’S HARD,

07:17.611 --> 07:19.656
BUT YOUR PARENTS
ASKED US TO KEEP YOU SAFE.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.571
WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'’S WAITING
FOR US DOWN THERE.

07:21.615 --> 07:23.573
ECHO: WHICH IS WHY WE SHOULD
TAKE OUR BEST FIGHTERS.

07:23.617 --> 07:25.314
MY SISTER IS
THE LAST PERSON

07:25.357 --> 07:26.837
I TRUST NOT
TO SHOOT FIRST,

07:26.881 --> 07:28.448
SO SHE STAYS ON ICE
WITH EVERYONE ELSE

07:28.491 --> 07:29.797
UNTIL WE KNOW WHAT
WE'’RE DEALING WITH.

07:29.840 --> 07:32.103
AND IF IT'’S
TOO LATE BY THEN?

07:32.147 --> 07:35.367
FINE. I'’LL WAKE UP
MILLER. GOOD.

07:35.411 --> 07:38.109
SAY YOUR GOOD-BYES.
HEAD TO THE TRANSPORT SHIP.

07:38.153 --> 07:41.330
WELL, I CALL SHOTGUN.

07:48.076 --> 07:51.166
YOU KEEP
EACH OTHER SAFE.

07:51.209 --> 07:52.733
ALWAYS.

07:56.998 --> 07:59.957
HEY.
HEY.

08:00.001 --> 08:02.873
THANKS FOR TAKING ME.

08:02.917 --> 08:04.875
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
HARD FOR YOU.

08:04.919 --> 08:06.529
NOT REALLY.

08:06.573 --> 08:08.313
WE GO BACK, MILLER.
I TRUST YOU.

08:08.357 --> 08:10.794
EVEN AFTER I THREW
YOU IN THE PIT?

08:10.838 --> 08:14.494
MY SISTER DID THAT,
NOT YOU.

08:14.537 --> 08:17.845
WE'’RE GOOD, OK?

08:17.888 --> 08:22.023
ALL RIGHT. LET'’S LOAD UP.

08:22.066 --> 08:24.504
RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

08:35.210 --> 08:37.429
HERE WE GO AGAIN.

08:37.473 --> 08:39.736
GOD, I HATE SENDING
YOU TO THE GROUND.

08:39.780 --> 08:42.522
NOW I KNOW
HOW IT FEELS.

08:42.565 --> 08:44.524
LOOK, MOM. IF ANYTHING
HAPPENS TO ME--

08:44.567 --> 08:47.527
IT WON'’T.
IF IT DOES--

08:47.570 --> 08:50.834
I'’LL TAKE CARE
OF MADI.

08:50.878 --> 08:53.054
COME HERE.

08:57.232 --> 08:59.843
GO SAVE KANE.

08:59.887 --> 09:05.719
GO SAVE US ALL.

09:15.250 --> 09:17.078
HOW ARE THOSE
INSTRUMENTS, SHAW?

09:17.121 --> 09:20.385
SHAW, ON RADIO:
INSTRUMENTS ARE FOR AMATEURS.

09:20.429 --> 09:22.736
JORDAN:
GOD, HE'’S COOL.

09:24.999 --> 09:27.218
COME AGAIN?

09:27.262 --> 09:30.047
WE LOST COMMS.
DAMN IT.

09:30.091 --> 09:32.223
WE'’LL SEE ABOUT THAT.
MOVE OVER. OK.

09:32.267 --> 09:33.790
I WANT TO CHANGE
OUR ORBIT,

09:33.834 --> 09:35.139
FIND US A SPOT WITH
LESS INTERFERENCE.

09:35.183 --> 09:36.401
CAN YOU MAKE
THAT HAPPEN?

09:36.445 --> 09:39.927
YES, MA'’AM. I'M ON IT.
WAIT.

09:39.970 --> 09:43.539
WHAT IS THAT?

09:44.845 --> 09:49.066
LOOKS LIKE
AN AURORA. COOL.

09:49.110 --> 09:50.938
AURORAS FORM
AT MAGNETIC POLES.

09:50.981 --> 09:53.941
DOES THAT LOOK LIKE
A POLE TO YOU?

09:53.984 --> 09:57.640
STOP SMILING AND PUT
US OVER THAT INSTEAD.

09:57.684 --> 09:59.990
I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT IT IS.

10:04.778 --> 10:06.257
SHAW: WE'’RE BELOW
THE IONOSPHERE,

10:06.301 --> 10:07.781
AND I STILL DON'’T HAVE
ANY INSTRUMENTS.

10:07.824 --> 10:10.261
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING ELSE.
HANG ON.

10:10.305 --> 10:11.654
IS THERE
ANYTHING I CAN DO?

10:11.698 --> 10:13.569
YEAH. PRAY.

10:23.405 --> 10:26.626
BOYS AND GIRLS,
MEET PLANET ALPHA.

10:55.002 --> 10:56.873
JACKSON: PLEASE BE BREATHABLE.

10:56.917 --> 10:59.702
PLEASE BE BREATHABLE.
PLEASE BE BREATHABLE.

11:05.534 --> 11:07.405
JACKSON:
BREATHABLE AIR--CHECK.

11:07.449 --> 11:09.799
RADIATION LEVELS
GOOD, TOO.

11:09.843 --> 11:11.148
ELIGIUS III DIDN'’T
NEED TO SEND

11:11.192 --> 11:12.410
NIGHTBLOODS,
AFTER ALL.

11:12.454 --> 11:14.151
HOW ABOUT THAT
BEACON, SHAW?

11:14.195 --> 11:16.414
8 CLICKS DUE EAST.
I THINK IT'’S ON HIGH GROUND.

11:16.458 --> 11:18.852
THERE'’S A WATER SOURCE
ABOUT HALFWAY.

11:18.895 --> 11:21.506
YOU SHOULD GO FIRST
THIS TIME.

11:21.550 --> 11:25.641
NO. WE GO TOGETHER,
ALL OF US.

11:28.644 --> 11:32.517
ANYONE GOT ANYTHING BETTER THAN
"WE'’RE BACK, BITCHES"?

11:32.561 --> 11:35.825
MURPHY: MONTY WOULD KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

11:35.869 --> 11:37.827
HE SHOULD BE HERE.

11:37.871 --> 11:39.568
HE IS.

11:39.611 --> 11:41.004
MILLER: WATCH YOUR BACKS.
LOCKING IT UP.

11:41.048 --> 11:43.746
HE ALREADY SAID IT--
"DO BETTER THERE"--

11:43.790 --> 11:45.835
SO LET'’S DO BETTER.

11:45.879 --> 11:49.752
SHAW: THAT'’S EASY TO SAY,
BUT TALK IS CHEAP.

11:51.885 --> 11:53.538
HEY, LOOK.

11:53.582 --> 11:57.194
HE'’LL COME AROUND.
THEY ALL WILL.

11:57.238 --> 12:00.110
DON'’T FALL BEHIND.

12:05.159 --> 12:07.509
THANK YOU, MONTY.

12:15.125 --> 12:17.301
HOW LONG DOES IT
TAKE TO WORK?

12:17.345 --> 12:18.912
YOU TELL ME.

12:18.955 --> 12:22.306
YOU WERE WITH BELLAMY WHEN
HE USED IT ON BLODREINA.

12:22.350 --> 12:23.743
NEVER MIND.

12:23.786 --> 12:25.048
WE NEED BLOOD
FOR THE SURGERY,

12:25.092 --> 12:27.050
LOTS OF IT,
UNIVERSAL DONORS ONLY.

12:27.094 --> 12:28.748
THAT MEANS SKAIKRU.

12:28.791 --> 12:30.401
NOT MANY SKAIKRU LEFT.
HOW MUCH DO WE NEED?

12:30.445 --> 12:33.056
WAKE THEM ALL,
EVERYONE BUT OCTAVIA,

12:33.100 --> 12:36.407
PINT EACH.
COPY THAT.

12:36.451 --> 12:38.670
I'’LL START WITH RAVEN.
NO.

12:38.714 --> 12:41.499
I'’LL HANDLE RAVEN.

12:49.464 --> 12:52.467
JORDAN: REPOSITIONING
FOR THE NOT-AN-AURORA NOW.

12:52.510 --> 12:55.165
RAVEN, TAKE
A LOOK AT THIS.

12:59.300 --> 13:02.303
HOLY CRAP.

13:10.528 --> 13:13.880
ALPHA'’S NOT A PLANET.
IT'’S A MOON.

13:15.707 --> 13:18.145
RAVEN, CHECK THIS OUT.

13:21.539 --> 13:23.324
RAVEN--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:23.367 --> 13:24.629
I TOLD YOU TO
TAKE US LOWER.

13:24.673 --> 13:29.156
I AM, AND IN SO DOING...

13:35.423 --> 13:37.077
RAVEN: OH...

13:38.687 --> 13:41.342
ALPHA'’S A MOON.
YEAH.

13:44.519 --> 13:48.175
MOM AND DAD WOULD
HAVE LOVED THIS.

13:50.699 --> 13:53.136
HEY, I MISS
THEM, TOO.

13:53.180 --> 13:58.359
UH, I'’LL BE
RIGHT BACK.

14:02.711 --> 14:05.105
JORDAN--

14:06.802 --> 14:08.151
WHAT DO YOU
WANT, ABBY?

14:08.195 --> 14:11.067
JUST YOUR BLOOD.

14:11.111 --> 14:13.374
MONTY'’S ALGAE
IS WORKING,

14:13.417 --> 14:14.679
AND MARCUS IS
PREPPED FOR SURGERY.

14:14.723 --> 14:17.334
FINE. JUST TAKE
WHAT YOU NEED.

14:17.378 --> 14:19.467
THANK YOU.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.387
ANY WORD
FROM THE GROUND?

14:26.430 --> 14:29.781
YOU MIND IF WE
DON'’T TALK?

14:39.574 --> 14:43.360
RAVEN, I'’M SORRY.

14:43.404 --> 14:45.885
WHAT I DID TO YOU WITH
THE COLLAR IS UNFORGIVABLE.

14:45.928 --> 14:47.625
THEN WHY BOTHER
APOLOGIZING?

14:47.669 --> 14:50.280
BECAUSE I'’M CLEAN NOW.

14:50.324 --> 14:52.456
FOR HOW LONG?

14:52.500 --> 14:56.112
I BET YOU'’RE ALREADY THINKING
ABOUT YOUR NEXT DOSE,

14:56.156 --> 14:59.637
MISSING THE WAY
IT MAKES YOU FEEL.

14:59.681 --> 15:04.033
SCRATCH THAT--
NOT FEEL.

15:04.077 --> 15:07.036
RAVEN, I'’M NOT
YOUR MOTHER.

15:07.080 --> 15:10.387
YOU'’RE RIGHT.
YOU'’RE NOT.

15:10.431 --> 15:11.911
MY MOTHER MAY
HAVE BEEN A DRUNK

15:11.954 --> 15:14.783
WHO SOLD HERSELF
FOR BOOZE.

15:14.826 --> 15:18.569
SHE NEVER HURT ME.
SHE NEVER USED ME.

15:18.613 --> 15:21.268
SHE SURE AS HELL
NEVER TORTURED ME.

15:38.459 --> 15:40.635
HAPPY
RESURRECTION DAY.

15:42.811 --> 15:45.553
WHAT'’S WRONG?

15:55.476 --> 15:59.871
WHERE'’S MY BROTHER?

15:59.915 --> 16:02.526
BELLAMY: LOOKS LIKE WE FOUND
THE WATER SOURCE.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.878
BELLAMY: WHOA.
NOW, THAT'’S A VIEW.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.987
WE CAMP HERE.

16:36.430 --> 16:39.172
LOOKS LIKE THE SUNS
ARE ECLIPSING.

16:44.699 --> 16:46.353
UH!

16:47.571 --> 16:50.052
YEAH.

16:50.096 --> 16:52.576
MURPHY--
MURPHY, WAIT.

16:52.620 --> 16:54.491
WE HAVEN'’T TESTED IT.
YEAH.

16:54.535 --> 16:55.840
YOUR WOUNDS HAVEN'’T
HEALED YET.

16:55.884 --> 16:58.756
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

17:08.723 --> 17:11.856
EMORI: JOHN?

17:11.900 --> 17:13.597
CLARKE:
SOMETHING'’S WRONG.

17:17.384 --> 17:19.429
WHOO!

17:21.431 --> 17:24.173
COME ON IN.
THE WATER'’S FINE.

17:24.217 --> 17:27.089
OH, WHO KNEW
COCKROACHES COULD SWIM?

17:27.133 --> 17:28.873
WHAT, YOU WANT ME
TO TEACH YOU?

17:28.917 --> 17:30.527
NO. JOHN, NO.

17:30.571 --> 17:31.963
OH, YOU'’RE
COMING WITH ME.

17:32.007 --> 17:35.924
I'’M SERIOUS. JOHN!
LET ME GO. JOHN! AAH!

17:37.012 --> 17:39.319
OH!

17:40.407 --> 17:43.366
BIG TROUBLE.
BIG TROUBLE.

17:43.410 --> 17:45.412
HA HA HA! AAH!

17:46.935 --> 17:49.633
MURPHY: WHOO!

17:57.119 --> 17:59.600
SHAW: ELIGIUS IV,
THIS IS EXPEDITION ONE.

17:59.643 --> 18:01.384
DO YOU READ?

18:01.428 --> 18:04.779
CHECK IT OUT.
ALIEN LIFE.

18:04.822 --> 18:08.391
AT LEAST SOMETHING
IS ALIVE DOWN HERE.

18:08.435 --> 18:10.089
WE'’RE THE ALIENS,
BY THE WAY.

18:10.132 --> 18:14.789
HEH. OH, MY GOD,
WE'’RE ALIENS.

18:14.832 --> 18:17.444
HEH HEH.

18:17.487 --> 18:21.317
HEY, WHAT'’S WRONG?

18:21.361 --> 18:24.842
IT'’S GOOD TO SEE YOU
HAPPY, JACKSON.

18:24.886 --> 18:29.108
HEY. HEY, STOP.

18:29.151 --> 18:31.675
WE BOTH DID THINGS
IN THE BUNKER.

18:31.719 --> 18:34.678
NO. I DID THINGS.

18:34.722 --> 18:39.292
YOU DIDN'’T STOP THINGS.
THERE'’S A DIFFERENCE.

18:40.641 --> 18:42.425
WE NEEDED TO SURVIVE.

18:42.469 --> 18:45.515
THAT'’S WHY YOU DID THE
THINGS THAT YOU DID...

18:47.561 --> 18:49.519
PERIOD.

18:49.563 --> 18:52.479
OH, I WISH THAT
WERE GOOD ENOUGH.

18:57.223 --> 18:59.616
SHAW: ELIGIUS IV,
THIS IS EXPEDITION ONE.

18:59.660 --> 19:00.965
DO YOU READ?

19:01.009 --> 19:05.056
MILLER HELPED KEEP
OCTAVIA ALIVE.

19:05.100 --> 19:08.147
SOMEDAY YOU'’LL
THANK HIM FOR THAT.

19:08.190 --> 19:10.671
WILL I?

19:10.714 --> 19:12.194
THERE'’S NO
STARTING OVER

19:12.238 --> 19:15.328
WITHOUT FORGIVENESS,
BELLAMY.

19:15.371 --> 19:18.505
WHO KNOWS THAT
BETTER THAN US?

19:18.548 --> 19:21.986
THAT MEANS
YOUR SISTER, TOO.

19:22.030 --> 19:24.989
SHAW: ELIGIUS IV,
THIS IS EXPEDITION ONE.

19:25.033 --> 19:27.644
I CAN'’T.

19:27.688 --> 19:31.996
ONE MORE TIME, ELIGIUS IV,
THIS IS EXPEDITION ONE.

19:32.040 --> 19:35.217
RAVEN, DO YOU READ?

19:35.261 --> 19:39.134
RAVEN'’LL
GET THE RADIO FIXED.

19:46.097 --> 19:49.231
I'’M SORRY I TURNED
YOU IN, SHAW.

19:49.275 --> 19:50.711
YOU REALLY WANT
TO DO THIS NOW?

19:50.754 --> 19:52.321
MAYBE YOU TWO SHOULD
SPEAK IN PRIVATE.

19:52.365 --> 19:54.193
CLARKE: NO. I WANT
YOU ALL TO HEAR THIS.

19:54.236 --> 19:56.891
GREAT.

19:56.934 --> 20:01.939
IF I COULD, I'’D GO BACK
AND DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY,

20:01.983 --> 20:04.725
BUT I CAN'’T.

20:04.768 --> 20:07.249
NONE OF US CAN.

20:07.293 --> 20:10.557
FOR SOME REASON, MONTY THOUGHT
WE DESERVED A SECOND CHANCE.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.036
NOT FOR NOTHING,
BUT THIS IS, LIKE,

20:12.080 --> 20:13.081
YOUR FIFTH CHANCE.

20:13.124 --> 20:16.693
YOURS, TOO, MURPHY.

20:16.737 --> 20:20.567
VERY GOOD.
I GOT WATCH.

20:24.135 --> 20:26.225
YOU'’RE RIGHT.

20:26.268 --> 20:28.052
YOUR FRIEND MONTY
GAVE YOU A SECOND CHANCE,

20:28.096 --> 20:31.099
BUT NOW WHAT?

20:31.142 --> 20:34.885
SALVATION COMES FROM
FAITH AND GOOD WORKS,

20:34.929 --> 20:37.975
WHAT YOU DO,
NOT WHAT YOU SAY.

20:38.019 --> 20:41.501
YOU HAVEN'’T DONE
ANYTHING YET.

20:44.112 --> 20:47.942
HEY, LISTEN.
YOU HEAR THAT?

20:50.336 --> 20:51.728
WHAT HAPPENED
TO ALL THE BUGS?

20:51.772 --> 20:53.643
JACKSON:
YOU GUYS GOT TO SEE THIS.

20:56.994 --> 21:00.302
5 MINUTES AGO, THIS THING
ATE A LEAF OUT OF MY HAND.

21:00.346 --> 21:02.826
NOW IT WANTS
TO EAT ME.

21:02.870 --> 21:06.308
NOT ONLY THAT, ITS ENTIRE
PHYSIOLOGY HAS CHANGED FROM--

21:06.352 --> 21:09.311
MURPHY: OH, LOOK AT THAT.

21:09.355 --> 21:11.966
YOU PET'’S PISSED
I KILLED ITS BROTHER.

21:14.229 --> 21:16.275
WHAT THE HELL
IS THAT?

21:20.975 --> 21:23.934
SWARM.

21:23.978 --> 21:25.414
ECHO: IT'’S COMING FROM
THE DIRECTION OF THE SHIP.

21:25.458 --> 21:26.285
WE'’LL NEVER
MAKE IT BACK.

21:26.328 --> 21:27.764
EVERYONE COVER UP.

21:27.808 --> 21:29.288
WE'’RE HEADING
TO THE BEACON NOW.

21:29.331 --> 21:30.419
EMORI: WHAT IF
THERE'’S NOTHING THERE?

21:30.463 --> 21:32.029
MURPHY: THEN
WE'’RE BUG FOOD.

21:32.073 --> 21:33.030
BELLAMY: ALL RIGHT.
EVERYONE MOVE. MOVE NOW.

21:33.074 --> 21:36.164
OW!

21:36.207 --> 21:38.862
BELLAMY: COVER YOUR FACES.

21:38.906 --> 21:40.647
EMORI:
MURPHY! MURPHY!

21:40.690 --> 21:42.779
SHAW:
THEY'’RE EVERYWHERE!

21:42.823 --> 21:45.129
EMORI: JOHN!
EMORI.

21:45.173 --> 21:47.349
HELP!
EMORI!

21:47.393 --> 21:48.829
EMORI:
WHERE ARE YOU?

21:48.872 --> 21:50.787
TAKE THE FLARE
OUT OF MY BAG.

21:50.831 --> 21:53.529
HURRY UP.

21:53.573 --> 21:56.053
IT WORKED.
THEY HATE THE FIRE.

21:56.097 --> 21:57.533
THE FLARES,
LIGHT THEM ALL.

21:57.577 --> 22:02.843
EMORI: OVER HERE!
JOHN, BE CAREFUL. RUN.

22:02.886 --> 22:04.671
MURPHY: LET'’S GO.
WE GOT TO GO.

22:04.714 --> 22:06.368
HELP ME. WE GOT
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

22:06.412 --> 22:09.197
ECHO: STAY TOGETHER,
FLARES AT 3 CORNERS.

22:09.240 --> 22:10.329
MOVE!
LET'’S GO.

22:10.372 --> 22:13.201
GO, GO!
MOVE! COME ON.

22:13.244 --> 22:15.682
COME ON.
READY?

22:22.689 --> 22:24.691
SHAW: HERE. IT'’S HERE.

22:24.734 --> 22:27.171
YAAH! YAAGH!

22:27.215 --> 22:28.825
YAAGH! AAGH!

22:28.869 --> 22:30.349
JACKSON: SHAW,
GET OUT OF THERE.

22:30.392 --> 22:33.482
ECHO: IT'’S KILLING HIM.
GET HIM OUT.

22:33.526 --> 22:36.920
CLARKE: IT'’S RADIATION.
IT WON'’T AFFECT ME.

22:36.964 --> 22:40.402
CLARKE, NO!
GET BACK!

22:40.446 --> 22:42.839
CLARKE:
HANG ON, SHAW.

22:42.883 --> 22:45.102
I GOT YOU.

22:50.456 --> 22:53.023
GET BACK.
I'’VE GOT 3 MORE FLARES.

22:53.067 --> 22:55.852
BELLAMY: CLARKE, WE'’RE
RUNNING OUT OF TIME HERE.

22:55.896 --> 22:57.376
HOLD ON.

22:57.419 --> 23:00.074
THE TOWER.
YES. I SEE IT.

23:00.117 --> 23:04.426
WAIT. ELIGIUS TECH,
THE FAILSAFE CODE--

23:04.470 --> 23:07.429
47815.

23:07.473 --> 23:09.126
EMORI: CLARKE, HURRY!

23:10.432 --> 23:12.086
UH!

23:17.918 --> 23:20.311
EMORI: CLARKE, HELP!

23:20.355 --> 23:22.749
IT'’S DOWN! RUN NOW!

23:22.792 --> 23:25.447
BELLAMY: COME ON!
LET'’S GO! GO, GO, GO!

23:25.491 --> 23:28.189
EVERYONE PUT
YOUR SHIELD UP.

23:41.158 --> 23:43.987
EARN THIS.

23:45.772 --> 23:49.689
NO. NO. DON'’T WASTE IT.

23:57.305 --> 24:01.918
TELL RAVEN
SHE DESERVES HAPPINESS.

24:01.962 --> 24:04.138
SHE DOESN'’T THINK SHE DOES,

24:04.181 --> 24:07.837
BUT...SHE DOES.

24:37.650 --> 24:40.870
HE'’S STRONG,
AND YOU'’RE GOOD.

24:44.352 --> 24:46.441
HE WAKES UP,
HE'’S GONNA BE IN PAIN.

24:57.191 --> 24:59.541
DID YOU MOVE
THE PAIN MEDS?

24:59.585 --> 25:01.848
NO. THEY WERE
RIGHT THERE.

25:12.075 --> 25:13.686
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

25:13.729 --> 25:15.557
BELLAMY TOLD ME TO
TAKE CARE OF THIS SHIP.

25:15.601 --> 25:17.428
THAT'’S WHAT I'M DOING.

25:17.472 --> 25:19.387
BY KEEPING ESSENTIAL
MEDICINE FROM MARCUS.

25:19.430 --> 25:21.171
SO KANE'’S AWAKE?

25:21.215 --> 25:24.087
THAT'’S WHY
YOU'’RE HERE, RIGHT?

25:24.131 --> 25:26.220
MAYBE YOU'’RE JUST
CHECKING YOUR STASH,

25:26.263 --> 25:27.526
MAKING SURE
IT'’S STILL THERE.

25:27.569 --> 25:28.918
RAVEN, I
APOLOGIZED TO YOU.

25:28.962 --> 25:30.572
I TOLD YOU
THAT I WAS CLEAN.

25:30.616 --> 25:33.923
NOW GIVE ME
THE DAMN PILLS!

25:43.759 --> 25:46.109
LET'’S JUST GET
THIS OVER WITH.

25:46.153 --> 25:48.372
THE FASTER YOU FALL OFF THE
WAGON AND KILL YOURSELF,

25:48.416 --> 25:52.638
THE SOONER
WE CAN MOVE ON.

26:00.907 --> 26:04.388
WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE
HAVE A RADIATION FENCE?

26:04.432 --> 26:06.695
CLARKE: THE KIND OF PEOPLE
THAT WANT TO KEEP SOMETHING OUT.

26:06.739 --> 26:11.874
BEACON SHOULD
BE RIGHT UP AHEAD.

26:11.918 --> 26:14.224
CLARKE: WHAT ARE
WE GONNA TELL RAVEN?

26:14.268 --> 26:16.792
HE DIED A HERO.

26:16.836 --> 26:18.707
MURPHY: LOOK. I DO HATE
TO MAKE THIS ABOUT US, BUT--

26:18.751 --> 26:21.318
THEN DON'’T. SHAW JUST
SAVED YOUR LIFE, MURPHY.

26:21.362 --> 26:22.972
I'’M AWARE.

26:23.016 --> 26:25.322
I'’M ALSO AWARE THAT
WE JUST LOST OUR PILOT.

26:25.366 --> 26:27.411
MADI'’S STILL UP THERE.

26:27.455 --> 26:28.761
YOU'’RE NOT WORRIED YOU'RE
NEVER GONNA SEE HER AGAIN?

26:28.804 --> 26:31.328
MILLER: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
EASY, EASY.

26:31.372 --> 26:34.157
IGNORE HIM.

26:34.201 --> 26:38.074
YEAH. YOUR RED QUEEN IS STILL
UP THERE, TOO, MILLER.

26:38.118 --> 26:39.989
WHO YOU GONNA
FOLLOW NOW?

26:40.033 --> 26:41.991
BELLAMY: HEY. HEY!
MILLER.

26:42.035 --> 26:44.603
AS THERAPEUTIC AS IT IS
TO BEAT UP ON MURPHY,

26:44.646 --> 26:47.083
EMORI CAN FLY.

26:47.127 --> 26:49.477
SURE. YEAH.

26:49.520 --> 26:51.435
I'’VE HAD ONE SUCCESSFUL
LANDING IN A SHIP

26:51.479 --> 26:53.437
I TRAINED IN
FOR 6 YEARS.

26:53.481 --> 26:56.310
NO PROBLEM.

27:03.534 --> 27:05.449
ECHO: GUYS, STAIRS.

27:05.493 --> 27:07.103
BELLAMY: EASY.

27:07.147 --> 27:09.366
WE APPROACH SLOW,
NO HOSTILE MOVEMENTS.

27:27.384 --> 27:29.169
THEY HAVE A CASTLE.

28:12.212 --> 28:14.083
HEY...

28:18.305 --> 28:20.699
ALIE?

28:26.400 --> 28:28.750
RIGHT.

28:36.889 --> 28:38.760
HELLO?
INVADERS FROM EARTH.

28:38.804 --> 28:40.196

28:40.240 --> 28:42.285

28:45.811 --> 28:46.768

28:48.596 --> 28:50.206

28:50.250 --> 28:51.947

BELLAMY'’S RIGHT.

28:51.991 --> 28:55.298

WE CAN'’T BE JUST--

28:55.342 --> 28:57.605

28:57.648 --> 29:00.608

29:11.532 --> 29:14.796

OF SHRINE.

29:14.840 --> 29:17.407

29:17.451 --> 29:19.714
ELIGIUS III.

29:21.498 --> 29:24.240
CLARKE: ALL NAMED
LIGHTBOURNE.

29:24.284 --> 29:26.765

29:26.808 --> 29:29.419
NICE TO BE
REMEMBERED.

29:29.463 --> 29:32.031
OR WORSHIPPED.
YEAH.

29:33.510 --> 29:35.425
DEAD BUGS.

29:38.515 --> 29:40.343
KARMA'’S A BITCH.

29:40.387 --> 29:42.693
COME ON.
WE SHOULDN'’T BE HERE.

29:42.737 --> 29:46.523
HEY, YOU WANT
A MUSIC PLAYER?

29:46.567 --> 29:49.700
BEHAVE, MURPHY.

29:49.744 --> 29:52.486
ALL RIGHT.

30:17.772 --> 30:20.209

30:23.865 --> 30:26.737
THANK GOD.
OHH...

30:26.781 --> 30:30.350
MARCUS.

30:33.179 --> 30:35.355
I THOUGHT
I'’D LOST YOU.

30:37.618 --> 30:39.968
VINSON.

30:40.012 --> 30:43.667
HE'’S BEEN DEAD
FOR 125 YEARS.

30:46.627 --> 30:49.064
YOU'’RE GONNA
LIKE THIS.

30:52.720 --> 30:54.330

MARCUS.

30:54.374 --> 30:56.767
I'’M OK.

30:56.811 --> 31:00.206
I'’VE NEVER BEEN
MORE OK IN MY LIFE.

31:00.249 --> 31:03.600
WE SENT AN EXPLORATORY
TEAM DOWN THERE.

31:03.644 --> 31:06.603
CLARKE'’S ON IT.

31:06.647 --> 31:09.868
SHE'’LL BE FINE.

31:09.911 --> 31:13.219
ABBY, EVERYTHING WE DID,

31:13.262 --> 31:15.917
EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED

31:15.961 --> 31:19.486
HAPPENED SO WE
COULD GET HERE.

31:20.922 --> 31:24.273
I BELIEVE THAT, TOO.

31:24.317 --> 31:27.711
THEN YOU'’RE A BIGGER
FOOL THAN HIM.

31:27.755 --> 31:30.540
WHERE'’S NIYLAH?

31:30.584 --> 31:33.065
WAKING PEOPLE SHE
SHOULDN'’T HAVE, APPARENTLY.

31:33.108 --> 31:34.631
SHE NEEDED MY
BLOOD TO SAVE

31:34.675 --> 31:37.112
THE LIFE
OF A TRAITOR.

31:37.156 --> 31:39.419
I'’D GLADLY GIVE IT BACK
IF I COULD.

31:39.462 --> 31:42.422
YOU THINK YOU'’RE
BETTER THAN ME, KANE?

31:42.465 --> 31:45.642
WE LOST 417 PEOPLE
IN THAT GORGE.

31:45.686 --> 31:47.818
ETHAN WAS
THE FIRST TO DIE.

31:47.862 --> 31:50.038
THEY PUT A BULLET
IN HIS HEAD.

31:50.082 --> 31:51.605
I WONDER HOW
YOUR FRIEND JAHA

31:51.648 --> 31:53.737
WOULD FEEL
ABOUT THAT.

31:53.781 --> 31:55.217
MARCUS, WE REALLY NEED TO
GET YOU TO THE STRETCHER.

31:55.261 --> 31:58.438
NO. YOU LED THEM
TO THE SLAUGHTER.

31:58.481 --> 31:59.918
IT WAS ONLY
A SLAUGHTER

31:59.961 --> 32:01.484
BECAUSE YOU
BETRAYED US.

32:01.528 --> 32:03.312
I WAS PROMISED THAT YOU'’D
BE ALLOWED TO SURRENDER

32:03.356 --> 32:05.445
AND THEN WORK OUT TERMS
FOR SHARING THE VALLEY.

32:05.488 --> 32:07.490
YOU WERE PROMISED?

32:07.534 --> 32:09.579
PROMISED BY WHO,

32:09.623 --> 32:11.668
BY WHICH MURDERING
PSYCHOPATH?

32:11.712 --> 32:13.844
EVERYTHING I DID
IN THAT BUNKER

32:13.888 --> 32:16.064
I DID FOR MY PEOPLE.

32:16.108 --> 32:19.938
AM I A MONSTER?
IS THAT IT?

32:19.981 --> 32:22.941
JUST LIKE BOTH OF YOU--
THE CANNIBAL DOCTOR

32:22.984 --> 32:24.768
AND THE MAN SHE
LOVES, EVEN AFTER

32:24.812 --> 32:26.335
HE FLOATED
HER HUSBAND...

32:26.379 --> 32:27.946
ARE YOU THROUGH?

32:27.989 --> 32:29.686
THE MAN WHO CAUSED
300 OF HIS OWN PEOPLE

32:29.730 --> 32:32.602
TO DIE ON THE ARK WHEN
THE GROUND WAS SURVIVABLE.

32:32.646 --> 32:34.604
YOU THINK YOU'’RE
BETTER THAN ME, KANE,

32:34.648 --> 32:37.085
THAT YOU'’VE LEARNED
FROM YOUR MISTAKES?

32:37.129 --> 32:39.000
IF IT WAS UP TO YOU,
WONKRU WOULD HAVE DIED

32:39.044 --> 32:40.697
OF STARVATION
IN THAT BUNKER.

32:40.741 --> 32:43.352
YOU WERE TOO WEAK TO DO
WHAT HAD TO BE DONE,

32:43.396 --> 32:46.834
AND THEN YOU RAN,
BECAME A TRAITOR,

32:46.877 --> 32:48.967
MADE A DEAL
WITH OUR ENEMY

32:49.010 --> 32:51.317
THAT YOU KNEW THEY
WOULD NEVER KEEP.

32:51.360 --> 32:53.623
YOU DIDN'’T
HAVE TO WAGE WAR.

32:53.667 --> 32:57.279
YOU DIDN'’T HAVE
TO BURN DOWN THE FARM.

32:57.323 --> 33:00.456
YOU DID THAT
FOR POWER, FOR VANITY.

33:00.500 --> 33:04.373
YOU WERE LOST.

33:04.417 --> 33:06.636
YOU'’RE STILL LOST.

33:06.680 --> 33:09.335
WAIT. OH...

33:09.378 --> 33:12.294
MARCUS. MARCUS.

33:12.338 --> 33:15.515
HELP ME GET HIM
TO THE BED NOW.

33:21.390 --> 33:23.871
GET NIYLAH.

33:24.915 --> 33:26.961
NIYLAH!

33:28.789 --> 33:30.443

33:41.932 --> 33:44.326

WHAT CAN I DO?

33:44.370 --> 33:46.589

HE'’S BLEEDING OUT.

33:49.636 --> 33:51.029
APPLY PRESSURE.

33:57.470 --> 33:59.385
I SAID,
APPLY PRESSURE.

34:11.919 --> 34:15.575

WE'’RE GOING BACK IN.

34:15.618 --> 34:20.232
ABBY, THERE'’S
NO MORE ALGAE.

34:20.275 --> 34:23.931
HE WON'’T SURVIVE
ANOTHER SURGERY.

34:25.933 --> 34:28.327

34:31.939 --> 34:33.941

34:50.175 --> 34:52.786
