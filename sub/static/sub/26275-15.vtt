WEBVTT

00:03.351 --> 00:06.615
[all sniffing]

00:06.658 --> 00:08.399
I read somewhere
that the smell of doughnuts

00:08.443 --> 00:11.011
is one of
the strongest aphrodisiacs.

00:12.273 --> 00:16.059
You say some weird stuff
when you're hungry, Ed.

00:16.103 --> 00:19.802
That's how you get banned
from a doughnut shop.

00:21.499 --> 00:23.110
Hey, uh, have you guys
seen Boyd?

00:23.153 --> 00:24.937
Yeah, he was interested
in one of my cameras,

00:24.981 --> 00:27.114
so I gave it to him. He's around
here taking pictures someplace.

00:27.157 --> 00:29.116
Shoot. I'm on my break. I was
hoping to hang out with him.

00:29.159 --> 00:31.335
-That's a nice mother, huh?
-Huh?
-Hmm.

00:31.379 --> 00:33.642
Wanting to spend time
with her kid, yeah.

00:33.685 --> 00:37.733
My mother's idea of quality time
was me holding her ashtray.

00:41.128 --> 00:43.521
I once told my mother
I wanted to run away.

00:43.565 --> 00:46.742
Huh. We bonded
while she helped me pack.

00:48.265 --> 00:50.354
How nice.
I came in looking for my son,

00:50.398 --> 00:53.140
and I got cautionary tales.

00:53.183 --> 00:54.315
He's a 12-year-old boy.

00:54.358 --> 00:56.317
What trouble could he get into
in a store

00:56.360 --> 00:58.884
that only has
bow and arrows, crossbows,

00:58.928 --> 01:01.452
ammunition and knives.

01:01.496 --> 01:03.280
I'll find him. I'll get him.

01:03.324 --> 01:05.369
Thank you.
Uh, and when you do,

01:05.413 --> 01:06.588
tell him to meet me
in the Grill.

01:06.631 --> 01:08.242
There's a new Ping-Pong table.

01:09.286 --> 01:11.506
There isn't,
but he doesn't know that.

01:11.549 --> 01:13.943
-She's a good mother.
-Mm-hmm.

01:13.986 --> 01:15.553
-You know how I can tell?
-Huh?

01:15.597 --> 01:18.295
Boyd never has ashes
in his hair.

01:23.648 --> 01:27.043
Must've been
some brush fire, huh?

01:29.089 --> 01:30.612
Hey. Hey, Baxter?

01:30.655 --> 01:33.136
You were right.
Boyd is taking pictures.

01:33.180 --> 01:34.355
He's a real Baxter.

01:34.398 --> 01:35.747
On the roof.

01:35.791 --> 01:38.272
He's a real Baxter.

01:39.447 --> 01:41.449
â™ª

01:46.236 --> 01:48.325
What are you doing
up on the roof taking pictures?

01:48.369 --> 01:51.285
What if you'd fallen?
You would've broken my camera.

01:51.328 --> 01:53.200
I was urbexing, Grandpa.

01:53.243 --> 01:54.201
Oh, no, no.

01:54.244 --> 01:57.117
Urbexing? Is that a black thing
I should know about?

01:58.770 --> 02:01.208
I-I'm always far behind
on those.

02:01.251 --> 02:04.341
I just learned about
"Bye, Felicia."

02:04.385 --> 02:06.604
-Uh, don't be a square, Chuck.
-Now look at...

02:06.648 --> 02:08.650
He was up there smoking
the devil's lettuce.

02:09.999 --> 02:11.740
Urban exploring, right?

02:11.783 --> 02:15.047
Yeah. You go to places
in the city, like rooftops

02:15.091 --> 02:16.353
-or abandoned buildings.
-Huh.

02:16.397 --> 02:18.312
-It's actually cool.
-Hmm.

02:18.355 --> 02:20.618
Hey, Chuck, um, you probably
didn't know you and your Marines

02:20.662 --> 02:23.186
in Fallujah were
actually urbexing.

02:23.230 --> 02:26.058
[chuckles] No, no. We had
another funny word for it.

02:26.102 --> 02:28.278
Um, war.

02:28.322 --> 02:31.455
All right. Be careful, kid.
I'll see you later.

02:31.499 --> 02:33.457
-It's a lot of fun.
-Mm-hmm.

02:33.501 --> 02:36.678
-It's all about going to awesome
locations and taking pictures.
-Oh, look at this.

02:36.721 --> 02:38.288
Yeah, you just don't want
your pictures

02:38.332 --> 02:41.117
on the memory board
at your funeral.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.466
I thought you'd think
this was cool.

02:42.510 --> 02:44.251
I do think it's cool.
Taking terrific pictures

02:44.294 --> 02:46.340
is what I've done for years
for Outdoor Man.

02:46.383 --> 02:49.343
Mm, and I watch people shopping.

02:49.386 --> 02:51.867
If you really want to do this,
you want to do it the right way

02:51.910 --> 02:53.347
with the right equipment, okay?

02:53.390 --> 02:55.000
Instead of taking
rooftop pictures,

02:55.044 --> 02:56.785
you go to real mountains,
real scenery.

02:56.828 --> 02:58.047
-CHUCK: Hmm.
-Okay.

02:58.090 --> 03:00.092
Yeah, you'll be saying,
"Look, it's a-a sunrise

03:00.136 --> 03:01.355
here at Patagonia."

03:01.398 --> 03:04.445
Or you'll be saying,
"Look, it's a-a waterfall

03:04.488 --> 03:06.447
that disappears into a cloud."

03:06.490 --> 03:09.537
Look... a guy trying on a hat.

03:13.497 --> 03:15.195
That's a lady's hat.

03:21.288 --> 03:24.334
[imitates trumpet
playing fanfare]

03:26.684 --> 03:28.469
Oh, I'm gonna fix that.
That's landlord stuff.

03:28.512 --> 03:30.384
Well, it'd be kind of cool
if the lights did that

03:30.427 --> 03:31.472
every time we came home.

03:31.515 --> 03:33.735
[gasps]
Babe, you just called this home.

03:33.778 --> 03:37.042
-Oh.
-[chuckles]

03:37.086 --> 03:38.696
Oh, and that was
our first home hug.

03:38.740 --> 03:41.308
BOTH:
Oh.

03:41.351 --> 03:44.398
Oh-kay. Uh, well,

03:44.441 --> 03:45.964
obviously, you can see
it's a work in progress.

03:46.008 --> 03:47.314
I've just been
really busy downstairs.

03:47.357 --> 03:50.665
But this is your place.
Any questions, just ask.

03:50.708 --> 03:52.536
Can we have a pet pig?

03:54.234 --> 03:56.540
No. No pigs.

03:56.584 --> 03:59.500
So, I've listed things
that I'm gonna handle,

03:59.543 --> 04:02.329
but I also have a list of stuff
I want you guys to take care of.

04:02.372 --> 04:05.375
What does it say on your list?

04:05.419 --> 04:08.683
"Ha ha, I'm making them
do everything"?

04:08.726 --> 04:10.293
Yeah. This is a lot.

04:11.599 --> 04:13.557
Uh, do we really need an alarm?

04:13.601 --> 04:17.953
Um, wouldn't it be cheaper if we
just yelled "help"?

04:17.996 --> 04:19.955
Uh, now I know you guys
have some time,

04:19.998 --> 04:22.436
but that should be done at least
a week before you move in.

04:22.479 --> 04:24.176
However, I'm a cool landlord,

04:24.220 --> 04:25.743
so, like, five or six days
will be fine.

04:27.005 --> 04:28.703
Actually, you know what?
It's a week for a reason.

04:28.746 --> 04:29.878
Let's just stick to that.

04:29.921 --> 04:32.097
A week it is.

04:32.141 --> 04:34.491
Okay. Uh, I will
leave you to it.

04:35.971 --> 04:37.538
Welcome to your new home.

04:37.581 --> 04:39.757
BOTH:
Oh.

04:39.801 --> 04:41.019
Okay.

04:43.587 --> 04:46.155
Well, I guess we're adults now.

04:46.198 --> 04:49.201
Does that mean we have
to watch the news?

04:50.246 --> 04:51.900
Uh, what should we do first?

04:51.943 --> 04:54.468
Uh, I guess we should
start at the top of the list.

04:54.511 --> 04:55.295
[clears throat]

04:57.209 --> 04:59.386
[chuckles]
Did you see that?

04:59.429 --> 05:00.517
Anybody could do that.

05:00.561 --> 05:01.997
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

05:02.040 --> 05:04.608
All right.

05:04.652 --> 05:06.567
-I'd like to see you try.
-Okay.

05:10.266 --> 05:14.270
Ha! Double bounce.
Way harder than a one-bounce.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.446
Okay. We each get three throws.
First one to 11 wins.

05:16.490 --> 05:17.621
Small can scores double.

05:17.665 --> 05:19.580
Okay, one game. And then we call
those people and tell them

05:19.623 --> 05:20.798
we can't adopt the pig.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.720
-Did you check that carabiner?
-Yes.

05:29.764 --> 05:31.940
Did you tell your belayer
you're climbing?

05:31.983 --> 05:34.595
I'm climbing.

05:34.638 --> 05:37.032
Look at you climbing that wall.

05:37.075 --> 05:40.383
You look like that arachnid-boy
in the funny papers.

05:42.690 --> 05:44.866
How old are you?

05:44.909 --> 05:47.564
[grunts] All right, all right,
all right, that's good.

05:47.608 --> 05:49.174
Let's come on down now,
all right?

05:49.218 --> 05:50.611
I can just jump.

05:50.654 --> 05:52.569
You're not always gonna be
four feet from the floor

05:52.613 --> 05:54.266
with a padded mat, kid.

05:55.311 --> 05:56.530
There you go, there you go.

05:56.573 --> 05:59.097
Oh, yes, you're-you're
a natural, kiddo.

05:59.141 --> 06:01.448
That's right.
With the right equipment,

06:01.491 --> 06:03.406
-you can climb any wall.
-Mm-hmm.

06:03.450 --> 06:05.408
Just don't tell
the president that.

06:06.670 --> 06:09.543
I can't wait for Saturday.

06:09.586 --> 06:11.762
It's you, me
and the Devil's Thumb.

06:11.806 --> 06:13.982
How I envy you.
As a young man,

06:14.025 --> 06:15.766
-I climbed the Matterhorn
in the Alps,
-Yep.

06:15.810 --> 06:19.466
El Capitan in California,
and Alma Fernanda in Peru, yes.

06:19.509 --> 06:21.468
Alma Fernanda?
That's not a mountain range.

06:21.511 --> 06:22.512
I never said she was.

06:22.556 --> 06:24.471
All right.

06:24.514 --> 06:26.516
Let's go get your helmet,
and I'll tell you stories

06:26.560 --> 06:28.083
of my climbing days.
Come on.

06:28.126 --> 06:31.565
Just about mountains.
Climbing mountains, that's it.

06:31.608 --> 06:34.611
-Hey.
-Hey. Uh, Boyd told me
you're taking him

06:34.655 --> 06:35.873
climbing this Saturday?

06:35.917 --> 06:38.702
I talked to Ryan about it.
He said it was fine.

06:38.746 --> 06:41.270
Please don't tell me the guy
that runs the pot shop

06:41.313 --> 06:43.054
forgot to tell you.

06:43.098 --> 06:46.536
No one asked his mother.
And she says it's not cool.

06:46.580 --> 06:49.104
Yeah, well, maybe that's why
no one asked his mother.

06:49.147 --> 06:51.062
-Devil's Thumb
is too dangerous, okay?
-Oh.

06:51.106 --> 06:54.283
At least start him off
on the Devil's Footstool.

06:54.326 --> 06:56.590
It's dangerous,
but he'll be with me, okay?

06:56.633 --> 06:58.679
And we're just going up there
to take pictures.

06:58.722 --> 07:02.465
Dad, you can take your pictures
without risking my son's neck.

07:02.509 --> 07:04.728
I should know.
I used to be photo editor

07:04.772 --> 07:05.947
of the high school yearbook.

07:05.990 --> 07:09.733
Yeah, just for one semester,
and then... you know, Boyd.

07:09.777 --> 07:11.256
He's going through a phase.

07:11.300 --> 07:14.259
He just wants to take all
of these crazy risks.

07:14.303 --> 07:18.089
Yeah, you took
crazy risks... Boyd.

07:18.133 --> 07:19.700
You just pulled him off
of a roof.

07:19.743 --> 07:21.702
Okay, taking him
to Devil's Thumb is like

07:21.745 --> 07:24.922
telling him that he wasn't
aiming high enough.

07:24.966 --> 07:27.142
Look, you cannot stop
the kid from taking risks,

07:27.185 --> 07:30.362
but you can teach him
the safe way to do it, right?

07:30.406 --> 07:32.713
I don't like the whole idea.
Okay? So he's staying home.

07:32.756 --> 07:34.758
Because mother outranks grandpa.

07:35.803 --> 07:39.197
Yeah... not in my army.

07:47.336 --> 07:49.207
Hey, Mike Baxter here
for Outdoor Man.

07:49.251 --> 07:51.732
Listen. If you order one
of these spotting drones

07:51.775 --> 07:54.909
for hunters, it'll come
to your house in Bubble Wrap.

07:54.952 --> 07:56.563
But if you want to get
the most out of it,

07:56.606 --> 07:59.609
guess what you're gonna
have to remove.

07:59.653 --> 08:01.742
The Bubble Wrap.

08:01.785 --> 08:03.744
Kind of works the same way
with our kids,

08:03.787 --> 08:05.659
but it seems like it's getting
harder for parents

08:05.702 --> 08:06.921
to understand that.

08:06.964 --> 08:08.749
Because we've got a lot
of people running around

08:08.792 --> 08:11.578
like Chicken Little, shrieking
that the world's more dangerous

08:11.621 --> 08:13.144
than it's ever been.

08:13.188 --> 08:17.322
I take the contrary view--
surprise.

08:17.366 --> 08:20.804
Listen. Trumper tantrums aside,
I think there's never been

08:20.848 --> 08:22.676
a safer time to be alive.

08:22.719 --> 08:24.373
Sure there are still dangers
out there,

08:24.416 --> 08:26.723
but smallpox isn't one of 'em.

08:26.767 --> 08:28.595
Most of the things
that would kill us

08:28.638 --> 08:30.205
before we even
stepped out of the cave

08:30.248 --> 08:31.989
aren't even a risk anymore.

08:32.033 --> 08:34.557
But if you convince your kid
that the world's a scary place,

08:34.601 --> 08:37.255
damn it, it's going to be
a scary place.

08:37.299 --> 08:38.735
And if you're one
of those parents

08:38.779 --> 08:40.563
who feels compelled
to put your kid on a leash,

08:40.607 --> 08:43.044
you got to ask yourself,
are you trying to keep 'em safe

08:43.087 --> 08:45.786
or are you trying
to keep 'em close?

08:45.829 --> 08:47.483
It's tough watching something
you've worked so hard on

08:47.527 --> 08:49.790
hurl itself into the world.

08:49.833 --> 08:51.618
But I read once on an oven mitt,

08:51.661 --> 08:54.708
if you love something,
set it free.

08:54.751 --> 08:56.797
That's as far as I got,
'cause I was taking

08:56.840 --> 08:59.756
a beautiful brisket
out of that oven.

08:59.800 --> 09:02.846
If you don't set it free,
you could just cripple it

09:02.890 --> 09:05.414
and leave it in the basement.

09:05.457 --> 09:07.808
And between you and me,
if you want to let them go

09:07.851 --> 09:10.201
and keep tabs on 'em...
[chuckles]

09:10.245 --> 09:14.205
these drones have
a remarkable range on 'em.

09:14.249 --> 09:16.599
And they're on sale.

09:16.643 --> 09:18.514
Baxter out.

09:22.213 --> 09:24.520
Thanks so much for helping us
with the apartment, Jen.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.913
No problem.

09:27.871 --> 09:29.873
Mandy Baxter lines up her shot.

09:29.917 --> 09:32.876
Her height's giving her
what many fans are calling

09:32.920 --> 09:35.270
an unfair advantage.

09:37.011 --> 09:38.273
Boom!

09:38.316 --> 09:41.232
Nothing but can!
Pass me the avocado,

09:41.276 --> 09:43.626
'cause your game is toast!

09:43.670 --> 09:46.281
Baxter with quadruple points
for the win!

09:46.324 --> 09:49.414
[imitates crowd]

09:49.458 --> 09:50.764
W-Wait-wait-wait.

09:50.807 --> 09:52.635
What, bonus throws are
four points now?

09:52.679 --> 09:53.680
That doesn't make sense.

09:53.723 --> 09:56.291
You're right.
I mean, the Chinese

09:56.334 --> 09:59.207
only invented soccer, hockey,
tennis, and golf.

09:59.250 --> 10:03.341
But, yes, keep explaining
the rules of roomball to me.

10:05.953 --> 10:07.563
Anderson quietly concentrates,

10:07.607 --> 10:10.261
like a platypus preparing
to catch a freshwater shrimp

10:10.305 --> 10:12.873
in its cheek pouch.

10:12.916 --> 10:15.571
Google it. That's exactly
what you look like.

10:19.575 --> 10:21.055
KYLE AND JEN:
Whoa!

10:21.098 --> 10:22.796
-[chuckles] Yeah!
-[Jen boos]

10:22.839 --> 10:24.667
What the hell is going on
in here?

10:25.712 --> 10:28.497
Uh, playing roomball.

10:28.540 --> 10:30.238
I thought you guys were
supposed to be painting.

10:30.281 --> 10:34.372
In our defense,
it is the playoffs.

10:34.416 --> 10:36.853
Well, stop.
You're banging around up here,

10:36.897 --> 10:38.550
and I'm trying to run
a business downstairs.

10:38.594 --> 10:39.943
This is so exciting.

10:39.987 --> 10:42.903
I've never been yelled at
for being rowdy before.

10:42.946 --> 10:45.253
I know you think that
I'm the cool landlord,

10:45.296 --> 10:46.776
but I only rent to adults.

10:46.820 --> 10:48.909
And right now...

10:48.952 --> 10:50.562
you're acting like children.

10:56.177 --> 10:57.395
[Mandy scoffs]

10:57.439 --> 11:00.137
Who does he think he is,
calling us children?

11:00.181 --> 11:03.967
Yeah.
We're not children.

11:04.011 --> 11:06.013
[both sipping loudly]

11:10.017 --> 11:11.758
Hey. What's up?
You want to see me?

11:11.801 --> 11:12.759
What's up? I was thinking
about what you said

11:12.802 --> 11:14.935
about going to Devil's Thumb.

11:14.978 --> 11:16.501
And, okay, I'm gonna say
something I've probably

11:16.545 --> 11:17.807
never said to you before, um...

11:19.809 --> 11:21.158
You were right.

11:23.944 --> 11:25.728
Of course, the first time
that you admit that,

11:25.772 --> 11:27.948
there are no witnesses.

11:27.991 --> 11:30.515
It's always been safety first.
I always told you girls,

11:30.559 --> 11:31.865
safety first. Remember?

11:31.908 --> 11:34.911
No. You said "Reagan first."

11:36.913 --> 11:38.872
You're right, you're right,
you're right, right...

11:38.915 --> 11:42.440
I think I figured out a way
to keep Boyd completely safe.

11:42.484 --> 11:44.965
-Oh.
-All right?

11:45.008 --> 11:46.618
Aah!
Uh, what?

11:46.662 --> 11:48.969
Hi, Mom.

11:49.012 --> 11:52.842
All right, the Bubble Wrap's
not complete without this.

11:52.886 --> 11:53.887
Totally safe.

11:54.931 --> 11:55.889
And I can prove it.

11:55.932 --> 11:58.674
-Look out!
-I...

11:58.718 --> 12:00.807
-[laughs] I'm okay.
-Uh-huh?

12:00.850 --> 12:02.634
-Mm.
-You know? I can do this
all day-- aah!

12:02.678 --> 12:04.375
That's great.

12:04.419 --> 12:07.944
And not just because
this is a lot of fun.

12:07.988 --> 12:09.990
Give me a break, Dad, okay?
I'm not an idiot.

12:10.033 --> 12:11.600
I know that the minute
that he's out of my sight,

12:11.643 --> 12:13.602
he's gonna take off
all of that gear.

12:13.645 --> 12:15.517
She's got us there, Grandpa.

12:17.432 --> 12:19.826
[Boyd grunts]

12:19.869 --> 12:22.698
-All right, I knew you weren't
gonna fall for this, okay?
-Yeah. Nice try, though.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.221
No, no, no, I'm not done,
not done, not done.

12:24.265 --> 12:26.920
If you don't think it's safe
for us to go alone...

12:26.963 --> 12:28.704
why don't you go with us?

12:28.748 --> 12:30.010
Huh?

12:32.490 --> 12:34.492
I'm sorry. You want, you want me
to go climbing with you guys?

12:34.536 --> 12:36.059
Well, it seems like
it's the only way you'll feel

12:36.103 --> 12:39.149
like he's gonna be safe,
and that's the problem, right?

12:39.193 --> 12:42.979
Yeah. Uh, all right, yeah.
Uh, I guess I can go.

12:43.023 --> 12:44.241
Aw.

12:45.852 --> 12:47.288
What is that supposed to mean?

12:47.331 --> 12:49.812
-Nothing.
-Nothing-- look,
it's gonna be great.

12:49.856 --> 12:51.379
We're gonna have a blast.

12:51.422 --> 12:53.685
Not a blast, that's way too
dangerous. We'll have a snuggle.

12:55.252 --> 12:56.863
-Whatever.
-What-Whatever?

12:56.906 --> 12:58.038
Come on, you know
I hate that word.

12:58.081 --> 12:59.169
Whatever.

12:59.213 --> 13:00.431
[muffled]:
This is bull...!

13:00.475 --> 13:01.998
What did you say to me?

13:04.087 --> 13:06.916
Yeah. You know, he's right.
It-it will be a snuggle.

13:06.960 --> 13:09.789
It's gonna be the best damn
snuggle of your life.

13:12.748 --> 13:13.749
Come on.

13:16.578 --> 13:18.058
Listen, I'm sorry
about all the extra shoves.

13:18.101 --> 13:20.277
I just had--
[chuckles]: I had no idea

13:20.321 --> 13:21.975
how much fun
those were gonna be.

13:28.068 --> 13:31.854
Ooh, this is...

13:31.898 --> 13:34.422
not what we ordered.

13:34.465 --> 13:37.468
Uh, well, I don't know who
this Diane M. is,

13:37.512 --> 13:39.731
but she was smart enough to
order double orange chicken,

13:39.775 --> 13:43.083
-and we are smart enough
to keep it.
-Yeah.

13:43.126 --> 13:45.737
Hey, sweetie,
what are you doing here?

13:45.781 --> 13:47.087
Uh, I'm looking for
my old hiking boots.

13:47.130 --> 13:48.349
Did you put them somewhere?

13:48.392 --> 13:49.872
Oh, yeah.
The Goodwill bin.

13:49.916 --> 13:51.700
Three years ago.

13:53.615 --> 13:55.791
I just don't get why
people like hiking.

13:55.835 --> 13:59.751
It's just walking where
the ground doesn't cooperate.

13:59.795 --> 14:01.797
Well, Boyd's going up to
the Devil's Thumb with Dad.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.016
-Oh, nice.
-And I'm gonna go, too.

14:03.059 --> 14:05.105
Just to make sure he's safe,
you know.

14:05.148 --> 14:07.498
Uh, honey, is-is there
something else going on?

14:07.542 --> 14:09.109
No.

14:09.152 --> 14:12.155
Maybe. I-- I don't-- I just--

14:12.199 --> 14:14.244
you know, I just want
to spend some time with Boyd.

14:14.288 --> 14:16.681
He has had
no interest in me lately.

14:16.725 --> 14:18.031
-How old is he now?
-12.

14:18.074 --> 14:21.773
Oh... that is the most
painful time for a mother.

14:21.817 --> 14:25.125
I mean, even labor
only lasted 24 hours.

14:25.168 --> 14:27.040
Look, Kris, it's just a phase.

14:27.083 --> 14:28.084
Most kids go through it.

14:28.128 --> 14:29.956
Uh-- especially those boys.

14:29.999 --> 14:33.133
For 12 years,
Brandon was my angel.

14:33.176 --> 14:37.398
Next thing I know, he's snotty,
grouchy, aloof-y...

14:37.441 --> 14:41.576
all the dwarves that didn't
make it into that cartoon.

14:41.619 --> 14:44.927
It is not just boys. I mean,
I had my problems with Eve.

14:44.971 --> 14:47.277
Ah, I mean, if you think
about it, Eve was kind of

14:47.321 --> 14:49.018
the boy in our family.

14:49.062 --> 14:50.933
Uh, no, no, Eve was worse.

14:50.977 --> 14:55.372
Look, imagine a sullen teenage
boy who has periods.

14:56.373 --> 14:58.288
What did you do?

14:58.332 --> 15:00.769
Well, the hardest thing
a mom ever does...

15:00.812 --> 15:02.118
nothing.

15:02.162 --> 15:05.513
You know what-- get a cat.

15:05.556 --> 15:08.168
I can't just give up on my son.

15:08.211 --> 15:10.170
Sweetie, I'm not saying
give up on him.

15:10.213 --> 15:12.172
But just give Boyd some space.

15:12.215 --> 15:14.043
Be there for him
when he wants you to be

15:14.087 --> 15:17.220
and not necessarily
when you want to be.

15:17.264 --> 15:19.179
Your little boy's
turning into a man.

15:19.222 --> 15:21.964
And no man wants to change
in front of his mother.

15:22.008 --> 15:23.096
Oh, that is right.

15:23.139 --> 15:25.228
That is right. Look...

15:25.272 --> 15:27.970
Boyd loves you.
Just like Eve loves me.

15:28.014 --> 15:30.364
Just give him time.
He'll-he'll come back to you.

15:30.407 --> 15:31.365
When?

15:31.408 --> 15:33.367
Well, the sooner you let go,

15:33.410 --> 15:34.890
the sooner he'll come back.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.152
The only real question is,

15:36.196 --> 15:38.154
when are you gonna
stop chasing him?

15:38.198 --> 15:42.028
I suppose "until I catch him"
is the wrong answer?

15:43.377 --> 15:45.596
You don't want to catch
a 12-year-old boy.

15:45.640 --> 15:46.946
They're sticky.

15:50.036 --> 15:51.124
I guess you're right.

15:51.167 --> 15:52.603
I've heard other mothers talk
about this.

15:52.647 --> 15:55.041
It just wasn't supposed
to happen to me.

15:55.084 --> 16:00.263
Right. And I wasn't
supposed to turn 40.

16:00.307 --> 16:01.612
But that day is coming.

16:01.656 --> 16:03.919
-[chuckles]
-Shh!

16:06.704 --> 16:09.055
There's so much to do
on this list.

16:09.098 --> 16:11.057
Yeah. I don't even know
where to start.

16:11.100 --> 16:12.797
It doesn't even feel
like home anymore.

16:12.841 --> 16:14.060
It feels more like a cage.

16:14.103 --> 16:19.413
No. It's worse. You can have
a pet pig in a cage.

16:19.456 --> 16:22.633
What's going on in here?
It's too quiet.

16:22.677 --> 16:25.636
Nothing.
We're just being adults.

16:25.680 --> 16:28.813
And adults don't laugh
or squeal with delight.

16:28.857 --> 16:32.426
Guys, look, I'm not saying you
can't enjoy yourselves, okay?

16:32.469 --> 16:35.255
I just want you to knock
some stuff off the list.

16:35.298 --> 16:36.908
You don't have to lose
your sense of fun.

16:36.952 --> 16:39.433
Really? You did.

16:39.476 --> 16:41.043
Did I?

16:41.087 --> 16:43.872
Did you ever ask yourself why
there was a tennis ball up here?

16:43.915 --> 16:47.093
Oh, we don't really deal
with life's big questions.

16:47.136 --> 16:50.226
Or why there are all these
paint cans up here

16:50.270 --> 16:51.401
with no paint in them?

16:51.445 --> 16:52.837
Almost like, I don't know,

16:52.881 --> 16:54.752
someone put them there
for a reason?

16:54.796 --> 16:56.102
God?

16:56.145 --> 16:59.105
No... me.

16:59.148 --> 17:01.455
And it's not called roomball,
okay? It's called bounceball,

17:01.498 --> 17:04.197
and you're doing it wrong.
There's no double bounce.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.634
[scoffs]
Double bounce.

17:06.677 --> 17:10.159
Wait, you invented a game?
But you're all grown up.

17:10.203 --> 17:13.119
Yeah. I did.
And I'm really good at it.

17:13.162 --> 17:15.295
I don't believe you.

17:15.338 --> 17:17.297
All right.
Hand me the tomato.

17:17.340 --> 17:18.559
It's what I call the ball.

17:26.523 --> 17:30.397
Watch and learn.

17:37.186 --> 17:39.275
Can you teach us how to do that?

17:39.319 --> 17:41.495
Call me when you knock
the first thing off the list.

17:48.545 --> 17:51.287
-Hey, Kris.
-Hey.

17:51.331 --> 17:52.332
So?

17:52.375 --> 17:54.334
Did you conquer Devil's Thumb?

17:54.377 --> 17:55.378
Oh, it was great.

17:55.422 --> 17:58.251
I took pictures
of mule deers, snakes.

17:58.294 --> 18:00.253
I even got some
of a baby mountain lion.

18:00.296 --> 18:01.776
But we got the hell out of there

18:01.819 --> 18:03.952
before the mama
came looking for it.

18:03.995 --> 18:07.999
Well, that's just a mama
doing what mamas do.

18:08.043 --> 18:09.175
It was a long trip for the car,

18:09.218 --> 18:11.916
and Grandpa's gonna do
what grandpas do, so...

18:11.960 --> 18:13.179
I had a great time, Grandpa.

18:13.222 --> 18:14.310
You rule.

18:14.354 --> 18:16.051
I really wish I ruled.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.227
I would be fair but feared.

18:18.271 --> 18:20.273
And all my subjects would wear
really cool outfits--

18:20.316 --> 18:21.883
anyway, got to use the throne.

18:34.417 --> 18:37.420
Oh, I forgot about these.
Eagles!

18:37.464 --> 18:41.598
[chuckles]
Bradley Cooper's cray.

18:41.642 --> 18:43.252
Want to check it out?

18:43.296 --> 18:46.821
Oh, uh, no, that's-that's okay,
honey, that's-that's your thing.

18:46.864 --> 18:50.303
Mom, seriously.
I got right in on his face.

18:50.346 --> 18:53.088
Oh, my God.
That is an eagle.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.307
I know. Right?

18:54.350 --> 18:55.830
Wait, you-you took this?

18:55.873 --> 18:58.659
I took them all.
We had to be super quiet.

18:58.702 --> 19:01.444
I used the telephoto and opened
up the aperture all the way.

19:01.488 --> 19:03.446
That's a really cool effect.

19:03.490 --> 19:06.014
-That's a
depth-of-field deal, right?
-Yeah. I know, Dad.

19:06.057 --> 19:07.450
Yeah, you taught me that.

19:07.494 --> 19:09.452
Yeah. Uh, it's called
creamy bokeh.

19:09.496 --> 19:11.759
-Mm-hmm.
-You teaching him all my tricks?

19:11.802 --> 19:14.588
Hey. Good chance to teach him
all your tricks, huh?

19:16.155 --> 19:18.331
Anyway... it was a great trip.
I got to go, guys.

19:18.374 --> 19:20.071
-Thanks, Grandpa.
-I love you both.

19:20.115 --> 19:21.290
Thanks, Dad.

19:23.640 --> 19:25.425
It's so cool you know
about this stuff, Mom.

19:25.468 --> 19:27.601
Yeah, well, uh,
I used to be photo editor

19:27.644 --> 19:28.645
of my high school yearbook.

19:28.689 --> 19:30.256
Then I gave it up.

19:30.299 --> 19:31.474
How come?

19:31.518 --> 19:34.956
I found something I love more.

19:38.481 --> 19:42.050
Hey... why don't you
come with us next time?

19:50.058 --> 19:51.233
Uh, maybe.

19:51.277 --> 19:55.368
Yeah, I-- I'll-- yeah, maybe.

19:55.411 --> 19:58.197
Oh, it was a--
it was a mountain lion.

20:04.768 --> 20:06.509
I'm glad you took Boyd
to Devil's Thumb.

20:06.553 --> 20:07.858
Kids these days--

20:07.902 --> 20:09.686
they're only
into virtual adventures.

20:09.730 --> 20:11.427
Aw, tell me about it.

20:11.471 --> 20:14.125
With their Walkmans
and their-their Game Boys

20:14.169 --> 20:16.345
and their Donkey Kongs.

20:17.912 --> 20:20.480
You're gonna love the '90s,
Ed, once you get there.

20:21.959 --> 20:24.179
[chuckles] I remember all
the stupid dangerous stuff

20:24.223 --> 20:26.312
-I did with my friends as a kid.
-Yeah?

20:26.355 --> 20:28.879
W-We would hose down
the front steps,

20:28.923 --> 20:30.403
let it ice overnight,

20:30.446 --> 20:33.057
and sled down it in the morning.
[chuckles]

20:33.101 --> 20:34.755
-That doesn't sound
too dangerous.
-MIKE: Yeah.

20:34.798 --> 20:38.498
Oh, no. I was the sled...

20:38.541 --> 20:42.066
That's nothing. My buddies
and I used to play hot potato

20:42.110 --> 20:44.330
with cherry bombs.
That's fun, man.

20:44.373 --> 20:46.375
No one ever lost a finger?

20:46.419 --> 20:50.553
No. Yeah, my buddy Lefty
learned a lesson, though.

20:50.597 --> 20:53.513
Uh, look, I-I can
top both of you.

20:53.556 --> 20:56.516
My friends and I would have
these knife fights

20:56.559 --> 20:58.344
with another gang of kids.
[clears throat]

20:58.387 --> 21:01.521
Then we'd dance on the rooftops
until we got chased off

21:01.564 --> 21:04.785
by Officer Krupke.

21:08.354 --> 21:11.226
You're describing
West Side Story.

21:11.270 --> 21:14.403
It wasn't just a story.

21:16.013 --> 21:18.451
Well, the good thing
is that you-you grow out

21:18.494 --> 21:19.582
of doing that stuff.

21:19.626 --> 21:20.714
Amen.

21:20.757 --> 21:23.499
Hey, guys.

21:24.631 --> 21:28.374
I feel like a superhero.

21:28.417 --> 21:31.420
Want to see me throw myself
down the stairs?

21:31.464 --> 21:32.900
Absolutely! Yeah!

21:32.943 --> 21:34.945
-Let's do this.
-I'm first push!

21:37.818 --> 21:39.559
[chicken clucks]

21:39.602 --> 21:41.300
