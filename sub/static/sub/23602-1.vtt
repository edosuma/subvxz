08:46.276 --> 08:47.569
Hello.

08:50.739 --> 08:55.076
It's okay.
It's okay.

08:55.285 --> 08:56.578
It's okay.

09:28.318 --> 09:29.486
What do you want?

09:41.331 --> 09:42.999
There's no food here.

09:52.675 --> 09:54.177
Stop!

10:42.559 --> 10:44.269
It's just the two of you?

10:45.353 --> 10:47.313
We had a son.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.484
He didn't make it.

10:54.195 --> 10:55.113
I'm sorry.

11:02.954 --> 11:05.707
What you doing this far out
of the quarantine?

11:07.458 --> 11:09.627
We heard it hadn't traveled
this far.

11:10.712 --> 11:12.130
You heard wrong.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.977
I'd like to run some tests.

11:26.186 --> 11:27.061
What for?

11:28.354 --> 11:29.981
It's nothing
to be afraid of.

11:43.161 --> 11:44.454
Infected.

11:44.662 --> 11:48.041
Report to nearest
quarantine zone immediately.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.220
It needs to be treated
as soon as it appears.

12:00.428 --> 12:02.931
It is the only way
to keep it from spreading.

12:17.362 --> 12:19.197
Subject clear.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.701
I need you
to come with me.

12:24.786 --> 12:26.537
I have food and water.

12:27.705 --> 12:30.333
We can't travel
far in the dark.

12:30.541 --> 12:31.584
Just you.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.382
Trust me.
You will see her again.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.719
Please, we only want to help.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.763
You've helped enough.

12:43.972 --> 12:45.473
You won't survive out here.

12:46.683 --> 12:48.142
None of us will.

12:48.351 --> 12:50.937
You stay away from us.

15:39.355 --> 15:40.690
Anna.

15:46.737 --> 15:48.281
Anna.

23:18.314 --> 23:19.899
Anna!

25:14.722 --> 25:16.390
You think you're
any different?

25:19.393 --> 25:22.229
They're trying to survive
just like you.

26:11.820 --> 26:14.615
You want to see
your wife again?

26:18.285 --> 26:20.120
What are you doing to me?

26:25.459 --> 26:27.419
This didn't
have to happen.

26:29.463 --> 26:31.507
You can stop it.

26:37.513 --> 26:41.600
Find Dimitri tarkov.
He'll help.

26:41.809 --> 26:43.894
His daughter's name
is Daisy.

26:44.103 --> 26:46.480
But he wanted
to call her Violet.

26:49.066 --> 26:50.526
Let me out of here!

26:50.734 --> 26:51.777
Let me out!

26:56.115 --> 26:59.743
You are the way out.

27:22.057 --> 27:23.892
Are you gonna get him?

27:24.977 --> 27:26.520
It's your turn.

27:26.728 --> 27:28.730
Bullshit, it's yours.

27:45.038 --> 27:47.791
Hey.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.960
Come on, come on.

27:50.169 --> 27:52.171
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay.

27:54.590 --> 27:56.967
What's wrong?
You have a nightmare?

27:58.802 --> 28:00.971
Me, too.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.848
It's okay. It's okay.

28:11.982 --> 28:14.860
...it's killing
livestock at an alarming rate.

28:15.068 --> 28:17.321
I'm standing just 15 miles
south of Albany,

28:17.529 --> 28:20.199
near a farm that lost
hundreds of cattle overnight,

28:20.407 --> 28:22.242
shortly after the animals
developed sores

28:22.451 --> 28:23.785
along their necks.

28:23.994 --> 28:26.371
This month along,
more than 10,000 similar cases

28:26.580 --> 28:28.332
have been reported
in the U.S.

28:28.540 --> 28:31.960
In Albany, I'm Amber thomson
for krny news.

28:32.169 --> 28:34.046
And over the
vveekend, it looks perfect.

28:34.254 --> 28:35.881
A couple of showers
upstate New York,

28:36.089 --> 28:38.926
otherwise it's just been
sunny, cool, and crisp.

28:39.134 --> 28:41.929
Cleveland 62,
buffalo 61 on Saturday.

28:42.137 --> 28:45.390
Sunday, another day
complete with sunshine.

28:45.599 --> 28:46.975
Temperatures
a little bit warmer,

28:47.184 --> 28:51.688
but still running somewhere
about 70 to 75...

29:49.454 --> 29:50.872
These from your plants?

29:51.081 --> 29:52.457
From the compound inside.

29:53.667 --> 29:55.752
I'd like to take
a closer look.

29:57.713 --> 30:00.215
There's nothing
worth looking at.

30:00.424 --> 30:02.217
You have other priorities.

30:02.426 --> 30:05.345
It's properties
are almost identical

30:05.554 --> 30:07.889
to the anti-viral
Tyrell released last month.

30:09.391 --> 30:12.019
If you'd be willing
just to have it profiled

30:12.227 --> 30:14.604
to satisfy
my curiosity. Please.

30:17.566 --> 30:19.901
That article you wrote
caused quite a stir

30:20.110 --> 30:23.155
- at the department last week.
- Yeah, I didn't mean to--

30:23.363 --> 30:27.576
vve're here to DC the research they
fund, not satisfy your curiosity.

30:29.244 --> 30:32.372
Stay focused on the work
in front of you, all right?

30:32.581 --> 30:34.499
I don't need you
getting sidetracked.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.419
Sorry. Yeah.

31:13.080 --> 31:14.206
Hey there.

31:14.414 --> 31:16.375
I need to submit this
for profile.

31:28.512 --> 31:31.223
Okay. I'll have
the results in a few days.

31:32.516 --> 31:33.433
Thanks.

31:43.235 --> 31:45.987
We really appreciate you guys
watching him so much.

31:46.196 --> 31:47.989
Oh, please. Say no more.
We love him.

31:48.198 --> 31:50.158
And it's really good
practice for us, you know?

31:50.367 --> 31:51.993
- Mm-hmm.
-0000.

31:52.202 --> 31:54.579
Brad likes babysitting so much
he wants to open

31:54.788 --> 31:56.623
his own little day-care.
Don't lie. Don't lie!

31:56.832 --> 31:59.000
Oh, god no.

32:00.544 --> 32:03.755
- So, how's the research going?
- Mm. Good.

32:03.964 --> 32:06.550
You still, uh, tinkering
with that plant?

32:07.926 --> 32:09.553
Hey, have you ever tried
to smoke it?

32:09.761 --> 32:12.013
- Brad!
- What? It's a valid question.

32:12.222 --> 32:13.849
What?

32:14.057 --> 32:17.144
- It wouldn't do much for ya.
- There ya go.

32:17.352 --> 32:19.438
Well, you never know
until you try.

32:21.022 --> 32:23.400
- Ol-|, mo you tell them?
- Un-uh.

32:23.608 --> 32:25.735
We finally closed the deal
on the montauk house.

32:25.944 --> 32:28.405
Ah, congratulations,
that's great.

32:28.613 --> 32:30.449
Well, it took
long enough to close.

32:30.657 --> 32:32.701
Vve're actually going up this vveekend.
You guys should come.

32:32.909 --> 32:34.411
0l-|,
that's a great idea.

32:34.619 --> 32:36.621
We shouldn't come bother you
before you're all settled.

32:36.830 --> 32:38.582
- Yeah.
- Vvhy? Vvhat good is an empty house?

32:38.790 --> 32:40.292
Seriously. Just pack a bag
and the three of you,

32:40.500 --> 32:42.377
come on up.

32:42.586 --> 32:44.880
What do you think?
We could bring Dylan.

32:45.088 --> 32:48.925
- And he's never seen the ocean.
- Ah, so cute.

32:49.134 --> 32:51.344
This weekend is supposed
to be raining, isn't it?

32:51.553 --> 32:54.055
- Is it? - Vve'll just light
a fire in the fireplace,

32:54.264 --> 32:56.099
maybe grab a few
bottles of wine,

32:56.308 --> 32:58.852
maybe smoke some
of that plant of yours...

32:59.060 --> 33:00.479
Speaking of which,

33:00.687 --> 33:03.315
I have a lot of work
at the lab.

33:04.524 --> 33:06.693
Over the weekend?

33:06.902 --> 33:09.237
It's gonna be the end
of the month, and...

33:09.446 --> 33:11.948
- We're behind.
- Hmm.

33:12.157 --> 33:15.410
But we'll come out soon.
I promise.

33:15.619 --> 33:17.787
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.748
Listen, the house isn't
going anywhere

33:19.956 --> 33:22.125
- and you two are always welcome, okay?
- Thank you.

33:22.334 --> 33:24.252
- Absolutely.
- And pretty soon

33:24.461 --> 33:26.922
Dylan's gonna have a little
buddy to come svvimming vvith.

33:27.130 --> 33:28.632
Countin' the days.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.008
Already countin' the days.

33:30.217 --> 33:31.426
Me, too.

33:31.635 --> 33:32.802
Shut it.

34:03.708 --> 34:04.668
Hello?

34:04.876 --> 34:06.294
Chris towne?

34:06.503 --> 34:08.672
- Yes.
- My name is Jim eldon.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.924
I work for Tyrell
pharmaceuticals.

34:12.592 --> 34:14.636
Ls there something
<i>I</i> can help you with?

34:14.844 --> 34:17.013
Actually <i>I</i> was
hoping lcoul_l:> Help you.

34:17.222 --> 34:20.100
We noticed the article
you recently published.

34:20.308 --> 34:21.685
I was hoping I could
buy you a drink?

34:21.893 --> 34:24.603
Ask you a couple
of questions?

34:24.813 --> 34:27.690
Uh, I'm sorry.
Lt's-- it's late.

34:27.899 --> 34:30.025
And I've got work to do.

34:30.235 --> 34:32.946
They don't understand the
importance 0f your discovery.

34:37.534 --> 34:40.620
- What do you mean by that?
- Meet me for one drink.

34:40.829 --> 34:42.998
I promise you'll be
happy you did.

35:03.435 --> 35:06.062
...the next stop ls Broadway.

35:58.281 --> 35:59.824
It's spreading to humans.

36:00.033 --> 36:01.451
That's why I'm here.

36:04.371 --> 36:06.665
We want you to come
work for us.

36:11.753 --> 36:12.796
Why me?

36:14.673 --> 36:16.383
The compound from your plants

36:16.591 --> 36:19.094
is an alternative way
to fight the infection.

36:19.302 --> 36:21.680
It naturally produces
what we've been trying

36:21.888 --> 36:23.807
to chemically
synthesize for years.

36:26.810 --> 36:28.728
University will need
to know about this.

36:28.937 --> 36:31.064
Their involvement
won't be necessary.

36:31.272 --> 36:33.733
The last thing we want
to do is cause a panic.

36:33.942 --> 36:35.652
The more people that know
about this, the better.

36:35.860 --> 36:38.530
If this thing-- if this thing
were to get out of control?

36:38.738 --> 36:41.658
Look, my company has spent more
time and money studying this virus

36:41.866 --> 36:44.661
than anybody else
has bothered.

36:44.869 --> 36:45.954
We're the single reason
that this outbreak

36:46.162 --> 36:49.082
has not become
bigger at this point.

36:51.251 --> 36:53.044
With your help...

36:53.253 --> 36:55.922
We work together,
we can stop this thing.

36:59.843 --> 37:01.761
What do you say?

37:03.263 --> 37:05.765
I'll need to think about it.

37:05.974 --> 37:08.893
I didn't realize there'd be
anything to think about.

37:11.938 --> 37:13.815
Look...

37:15.775 --> 37:17.444
I know your salary.

37:17.652 --> 37:20.321
We can pay you
ten times that at Tyrell.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.870
Thanks for the drink.

37:27.078 --> 37:28.413
Where you going?

37:30.415 --> 37:33.376
- Home.
- Oh, that's right...

37:33.585 --> 37:35.920
You've got a family
to think about.

37:37.464 --> 37:39.257
And what's that
supposed to mean?

37:39.466 --> 37:43.928
Only that you'd be able to take
better care of them vvorking for us.

37:53.480 --> 37:54.939
Call me when you're ready.

41:19.519 --> 41:20.853
Dmitri tarkov.

41:22.146 --> 41:23.314
Do I know you?

41:25.566 --> 41:26.818
You sent me here.

41:31.531 --> 41:33.157
That's funny.

41:33.366 --> 41:35.702
Who put you up to this, huh?

41:35.910 --> 41:37.787
Anderson.

41:37.996 --> 41:40.540
You tell him
I'm sick of his jokes.

41:40.748 --> 41:42.917
He's a fucking asshole.

41:43.126 --> 41:45.837
Wait, wait. No, he told me
to find you.

41:46.045 --> 41:48.131
- He said you'd be a--
-lt's not funny, man.

41:48.339 --> 41:49.757
- No. No, please.
- Please leave me alone.

41:49.966 --> 41:51.509
- You don't understand.
- Get out of my way.

41:51.718 --> 41:53.469
He doesn't know what
they're going to do with it.

41:53.678 --> 41:55.471
There's going to be
a pandemic

41:55.680 --> 41:58.766
and he's going to give them the compound.
There's a virus, okay?

41:58.975 --> 42:00.685
- Come on. I don't have time for this.
- Look, look,

42:00.893 --> 42:02.437
you have to believe me.
Please, please.

42:02.645 --> 42:06.107
- People are going to die.
- Touch me, I'll call security.

42:12.363 --> 42:13.614
You-- you-- you have
a daughter.

42:13.823 --> 42:15.450
And her name is Daisy.

42:15.658 --> 42:17.785
But you wanted
to call her Violet.

42:39.766 --> 42:40.892
So, tell me...

42:41.100 --> 42:43.311
Who told you
about my daughter?

42:46.856 --> 42:48.441
You did.

42:49.942 --> 42:51.861
You really expect me
to believe this.

42:53.821 --> 42:56.157
I don't know
what to tell you.

42:56.365 --> 43:00.036
You wrote a book saying
time travel's possible.

43:01.412 --> 43:04.832
It's a theory.
We would never test it.

43:05.041 --> 43:06.751
The amount of energy required,

43:06.959 --> 43:09.003
if one thing went wrong,

43:09.212 --> 43:12.423
you create nuclear implosion.
You would never risk it.

43:14.842 --> 43:16.094
You will.

43:22.225 --> 43:24.644
If I had the ability
to go back,

43:24.852 --> 43:27.021
why would I send you?
Why not myself?

43:29.524 --> 43:32.276
- Because I can stop it.
- Oh, stop what?

43:35.238 --> 43:36.989
There's going to be a pandemic.

43:39.367 --> 43:41.536
I have a cure.

43:41.744 --> 43:44.539
But I'm going to give it
to the wrong people.

43:44.747 --> 43:47.291
<i>I</i> see. So <i>I</i> sent you back

43:47.500 --> 43:50.128
to help you stop yourself,
hmm?

43:52.255 --> 43:54.132
No,no,no.

43:54.340 --> 43:56.217
You can already see
the first signs.

43:56.425 --> 43:59.137
You're gonna start noticing people
vvith a rash on their neck.

43:59.345 --> 44:01.264
And there's
a very short window--

44:01.472 --> 44:04.308
I don't have time for this.
I have to pick up my daughter.

44:07.103 --> 44:08.521
She will die.

44:10.773 --> 44:14.068
You're sick.
You need help.

44:33.379 --> 44:36.757
Reports are comma <i>m</i> from China

44:36.966 --> 44:40.595
that an unknovvn virus has infected thousands
of people in the city of Shanghai.

44:40.803 --> 44:43.264
Doctors are still unsure
as to the origin of the virus

44:43.472 --> 44:46.142
that begins when victims
develop a rash along their neck.

44:46.350 --> 44:47.852
Now, the ambulance team

44:48.060 --> 44:51.689
are taking as many
precautions as they can.

44:51.898 --> 44:54.942
They're getting into
these white plastic suits,

44:55.151 --> 44:56.485
the hoods up.

45:00.364 --> 45:04.744
...vvorld health organization
is holding an emergency meeting.

45:04.952 --> 45:07.872
It could declare
a global health emergency,

45:08.080 --> 45:11.292
imposing travel bans
and border controls all--

45:21.594 --> 45:23.471
hey... yo.

45:23.679 --> 45:27.350
Got those results back.

45:27.558 --> 45:29.060
Thanks.

45:46.285 --> 45:49.580
We treated human cells
infected with a pathogen.

45:49.789 --> 45:52.875
The compound reduced
cell death by 20%.

45:54.585 --> 45:57.421
You show this
to anyone else?

45:57.630 --> 45:58.798
Not yet.

46:01.008 --> 46:04.595
I'll have them moved to the chamber
so we can better monitor them.

46:04.804 --> 46:06.806
And, uh, I can start
growing more.

46:07.014 --> 46:09.850
Oh, that won't be necessary.

46:10.059 --> 46:14.647
I'll need more time to verify the results
before jumping to any conclusions, so...

46:16.565 --> 46:18.317
This is my research.

46:19.568 --> 46:21.112
Not anymore.

46:24.448 --> 46:26.909
You can't do this.

46:27.118 --> 46:29.161
I'll go to the chair
of the department.

46:29.370 --> 46:34.125
He'll vvant tc knovv hovv you got these
through testing vvithout my approval.

46:34.333 --> 46:37.128
Forgery's a serious offense,
Chris.

46:37.336 --> 46:40.214
I had to prove to you. You didn't
even believe me that the compound--

46:40.423 --> 46:42.258
you haven't proved anything.

46:42.466 --> 46:44.051
If anyone found out
about this,

46:44.260 --> 46:45.928
you'd lose your job.

46:46.137 --> 46:48.347
I'm doing you a favor.

46:50.266 --> 46:52.059
I'll take over from here.

46:52.268 --> 46:54.770
If I need your help,
I'll ask for it.

47:11.162 --> 47:13.372
We'll give you your own lab.

47:13.581 --> 47:18.044
Entire staff. Everything you
need to continue your research.

47:18.252 --> 47:21.756
The team is so excited to see vvhat
you're going to be able to do.

47:21.964 --> 47:25.051
I'd like to get started
as soon as possible.

47:25.259 --> 47:29.847
Just a few details we need
to get straightened out first.

47:30.056 --> 47:32.933
Your plans for the compound?

47:33.142 --> 47:35.061
I'd like you to move those
to our lab.

47:37.313 --> 47:39.774
I can't do that.
The university owns them.

47:39.982 --> 47:43.736
I don't care about the university.
It's yqur vvork.

47:43.944 --> 47:45.029
You don't need to ask them.

47:47.656 --> 47:49.658
You want me to steal them.

47:49.867 --> 47:54.455
You're the one that's being
robbed 0f your own discovery.

47:54.663 --> 47:56.374
And you know the codes
to their lab.

47:56.582 --> 48:00.211
You can go in anytime.
I don't understand the problem.

48:03.047 --> 48:05.132
I'm just asking for you to take
what's already yours.

48:05.341 --> 48:09.345
It's not worth the risk.
I can replicate them for you.

48:14.392 --> 48:17.269
Your job, Chris, at Tyrell
depends entirely

48:17.478 --> 48:21.190
on our exclusive access
to the research and those plans.

48:21.399 --> 48:26.153
Anything other than that,
this deal is over.

48:26.362 --> 48:30.699
L-- I'm just trying to help you
get credit for your own work.

48:30.908 --> 48:33.285
All these years,
your discovery.

48:33.494 --> 48:36.080
But the only way I can help you
is if you help us.

48:43.712 --> 48:46.090
Pow.

48:50.052 --> 48:53.431
He loves his paper crane.

48:53.639 --> 48:58.144
Susan was saying that he
started to say <i>l-lls</i> first word today.

49:00.020 --> 49:01.856
He said "bird."

49:11.490 --> 49:12.867
Oh.

50:36.033 --> 50:38.911
This cures it?

50:39.119 --> 50:41.038
If it's treated
early enough.

50:42.706 --> 50:45.042
So why wasn't it stopped?

50:46.627 --> 50:48.546
Money.

50:50.756 --> 50:52.967
The more it spread,

50:53.175 --> 50:54.969
the more valuable
the compound became.

50:58.180 --> 51:01.183
They never had any intention
of stopping it.

51:25.874 --> 51:28.252
What is that?

51:28.460 --> 51:30.337
A warning.

51:57.740 --> 51:59.617
Are you okay? What ls it?

51:59.825 --> 52:01.243
Tell me, what is it?
Tell me!

52:01.452 --> 52:02.828
What's wrong?

52:03.037 --> 52:04.913
Your leg.

53:55.357 --> 53:59.319
Oh, sorry. I vvas trying to find
light svvitch for corner hall.

54:01.488 --> 54:03.449
Who are you?

54:03.657 --> 54:06.577
Uh, my name is Ivan.

54:06.785 --> 54:11.206
I'm sent here to, uh,
to clean floors.

54:11.415 --> 54:16.003
They tell me no one is allowed
here at this hour.

54:16.211 --> 54:17.629
I was just leaving.

54:17.838 --> 54:19.715
Not-- not that way.

54:21.717 --> 54:23.677
Uh, you'll slip.

54:24.803 --> 54:27.431
Please, this way.

55:30.828 --> 55:32.996
How's your leg?

55:35.082 --> 55:37.584
That was causing the pain.

55:39.920 --> 55:43.257
It was tracking you.

55:43.465 --> 55:44.383
What for?

55:44.591 --> 55:46.927
To follow you.

55:47.135 --> 55:50.138
That's why I disconnected it.

55:54.977 --> 55:58.438
There's something I would
like you to look at.

56:07.364 --> 56:09.908
It's okay, Daisy.

56:11.660 --> 56:13.161
It's okay.

56:13.370 --> 56:15.247
Let him see.

56:58.206 --> 57:01.501
Darling, I think you'll have
to stay home from school today.

57:01.710 --> 57:04.379
It's Mary Anne's birthday
today.

57:06.381 --> 57:08.008
She'll be fine.

58:22.082 --> 58:24.001
Where's her mom?

58:27.087 --> 58:29.297
She's gone.

58:29.506 --> 58:31.383
Cancer.

58:34.678 --> 58:36.763
I'm sorry.

58:36.972 --> 58:40.225
That's how all of this
got started.

58:40.434 --> 58:44.187
Trying to find a way
back to her.

58:44.396 --> 58:46.273
My wife...

58:48.233 --> 58:49.776
She's here.

58:52.571 --> 58:55.282
It is not your wife.

58:55.490 --> 58:58.910
You must stay away
from her.

58:59.119 --> 59:01.788
How can you expect me
to do that?

59:13.925 --> 59:17.721
By coming back here,
you've changed everything.

59:19.347 --> 59:22.809
There is no way for you
to know what happens next.

59:24.144 --> 59:27.355
If you want to protect her,

59:27.564 --> 59:29.608
you will stay away.

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:33.588
No, please.

01:00:33.797 --> 01:00:34.798
No!

01:00:35.006 --> 01:00:36.091
No, no, no, no!

01:00:36.299 --> 01:00:38.051
{Gunshot]

01:00:59.364 --> 01:01:03.201
It's okay.
We made it.

01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:05.453
We made it.

01:01:30.854 --> 01:01:34.149
He's dead.

01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:37.944
And you're still alive.

01:01:38.153 --> 01:01:40.197
Thanks to you.

01:01:40.405 --> 01:01:43.074
How is that possible?

01:01:47.913 --> 01:01:51.708
The second you interacted
with him,

01:01:51.917 --> 01:01:54.252
you changed his course.

01:01:54.461 --> 01:01:56.546
You created a new past.

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:01.760
You separated us...
From them.

01:02:04.221 --> 01:02:06.973
I'm not supposed to be here.

01:02:09.351 --> 01:02:12.395
We are survivors.

01:02:12.604 --> 01:02:14.689
We have earned the right
to be here.

01:02:38.421 --> 01:02:40.548
You grab his feet.

01:02:46.554 --> 01:02:48.640
Do you want her
to see him like this?

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.770
Here, take this.

01:03:37.772 --> 01:03:39.691
You will need it.

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:45.405
Where are you going?

01:03:45.613 --> 01:03:47.532
To see my daughter.

01:03:49.909 --> 01:03:52.620
You want to see them again,
don't you?

01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:54.706
Your family?

01:03:58.626 --> 01:04:01.755
You don't have
to lose them again.

01:04:01.963 --> 01:04:04.632
This is your life.

01:04:07.927 --> 01:04:10.889
All you have to do...

01:04:11.097 --> 01:04:13.016
Is take it.

01:05:40.061 --> 01:05:41.980
Your son?

01:05:46.276 --> 01:05:48.194
He's beautiful.

01:05:54.033 --> 01:05:55.785
You didn't show up
last night.

01:05:55.994 --> 01:05:57.829
I had people waiting
for you.

01:05:58.037 --> 01:05:59.706
Something's not right.

01:05:59.914 --> 01:06:02.167
What do you mean,
"something's not right"?

01:06:02.375 --> 01:06:05.253
There was someone
at the lab.

01:06:05.462 --> 01:06:07.338
At 2:00 in the morning?

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:16.014
You have to try again.

01:06:16.222 --> 01:06:20.685
I'm sorry, I ca--
i can't be involved in this.

01:06:20.894 --> 01:06:25.482
You don't have a choice, Chris.
You already are.

01:06:27.901 --> 01:06:30.653
Find someone else.

01:06:30.862 --> 01:06:33.907
It's too late.
We already released it.

01:06:36.201 --> 01:06:38.578
Released what?

01:06:38.786 --> 01:06:40.872
If you don't want to do it,
i will.

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:42.457
Just give me the codes
to the lab.

01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:43.708
Next time I see you,
this will all be taken care of.

01:06:43.917 --> 01:06:46.377
If I see you again...

01:06:46.586 --> 01:06:48.463
I'll call the police.

01:06:51.591 --> 01:06:53.510
Beautiful boy.

01:08:29.564 --> 01:08:31.064
You look nice.

01:08:36.863 --> 01:08:38.197
Where's Dylan?

01:08:39.866 --> 01:08:42.035
With Susan.

01:08:42.243 --> 01:08:44.578
Is everything all right?

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:46.831
Everything's fine.

01:08:57.508 --> 01:09:01.595
- Vvhat's vvrong?
- Honey, I need you to come vvith me.

01:09:01.804 --> 01:09:03.598
I want to go home
to Dylan.

01:09:03.805 --> 01:09:06.517
He's going to get it
from you.

01:09:06.725 --> 01:09:08.935
You're scaring me.

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:12.231
You don't have to be scared.

01:09:12.439 --> 01:09:14.651
I need you to trust me.

01:11:28.367 --> 01:11:31.788
{Susan]Hello?
- Susan, hi. Uh, it's Chris.

01:11:31.996 --> 01:11:36.125
Um, listen, something came up
at work and, uh,

01:11:36.334 --> 01:11:38.085
I hate to ask this
of you again,

01:11:38.294 --> 01:11:41.839
but is there any way you could
come and watch Dylan for me?

01:12:20.253 --> 01:12:21.838
You're gonna be okay.

01:12:30.221 --> 01:12:32.640
Ha.
Am I, uh, interrupting?

01:12:37.311 --> 01:12:39.730
We watched you come in
on the security cameras.

01:12:39.939 --> 01:12:43.025
We, uh, wanted to see
how far you'd go.

01:12:49.156 --> 01:12:51.075
This must be your wife.

01:12:53.244 --> 01:12:55.538
You didn't tell me
how pretty she was.

01:12:55.746 --> 01:12:57.415
What are you doing here?

01:12:57.623 --> 01:12:59.208
What you were supposed to.

01:12:59.417 --> 01:13:01.335
| can't let you take them.

01:13:01.544 --> 01:13:02.628
What are you doing?

01:13:02.837 --> 01:13:06.048
This isn't his fault.

01:13:06.257 --> 01:13:08.885
You said find someone else,
we did.

01:13:13.723 --> 01:13:16.934
They're using a compound
to save people.

01:13:17.143 --> 01:13:19.562
From a virus they created.

01:13:42.168 --> 01:13:43.711
Supply and demand.

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:47.131
Tyrell controls both.

01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:49.050
What's he talking about?

01:13:52.637 --> 01:13:55.264
What are you gonna do?

01:13:55.473 --> 01:13:58.059
Now that he knows
the truth.

01:13:58.267 --> 01:14:01.437
You'll have to shoot us both.

01:14:01.646 --> 01:14:04.482
No, Chris,
I'm not aiming at you.

01:14:09.445 --> 01:14:11.364
You have three seconds
to drop the gun

01:14:11.572 --> 01:14:13.407
or I shoot your wife.

01:14:18.412 --> 01:14:19.330
One.

01:14:22.625 --> 01:14:23.960
Two.

01:14:24.168 --> 01:14:25.544
- Chris--
- stop!

01:14:25.753 --> 01:14:26.629
Stop.

01:15:13.092 --> 01:15:14.427
Anna?

01:15:22.935 --> 01:15:24.645
Don't look at me.

01:15:29.191 --> 01:15:30.776
Close your eyes.

01:15:33.487 --> 01:15:35.656
Please, don't.

01:15:35.865 --> 01:15:37.158
Close your eyes!

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:52.835
Take care of them.
