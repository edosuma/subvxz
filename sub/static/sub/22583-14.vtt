00:19.325 --> 00:21.520
Who are you?

00:22.565 --> 00:24.317
They're targeting our engines!

00:24.445 --> 00:26.561
What do you want with me?

00:27.725 --> 00:32.162
You're the weapons expert. See if you
can get those shields back online.

00:34.165 --> 00:35.678
If we don't raise the shields...

00:35.805 --> 00:39.764
the only thing that's going to be
left of this ship is a cloud of vapour!

00:48.925 --> 00:50.483
Insectoids!

00:50.605 --> 00:52.880
These could be shield emitters.

00:57.245 --> 00:59.884
They're not going to last for long.

01:00.925 --> 01:02.881
Open a channel to those ships.

01:03.005 --> 01:04.438
- What?
- They're Xindi!

01:04.565 --> 01:06.157
I'll order them to hold their fire.

01:06.285 --> 01:09.960
It's been a long time since any Xindi
took orders from you.

01:17.685 --> 01:20.995
We're carrying 500 litres
of warp plasma in the starboard tanks.

01:21.125 --> 01:22.922
We'll have to vent it.

01:23.445 --> 01:25.754
Turn these down on my mark.

01:27.325 --> 01:29.885
They're going to destroy us!

01:32.965 --> 01:34.193
Now!

01:43.845 --> 01:44.834
What happened?

01:44.965 --> 01:47.240
The plasma got into their
intake manifolds.

01:47.485 --> 01:49.680
Their engines are overheating.

01:51.125 --> 01:54.800
I want to know who you are.
Why you've abducted me.

01:55.725 --> 01:57.955
You really don't remember.

02:00.445 --> 02:02.481
I was afraid this might happen.

02:02.605 --> 02:05.073
It's me, Archer.

02:05.205 --> 02:06.877
What species are you?

02:07.005 --> 02:09.565
You've been through a lot
in the last two days.

02:10.324 --> 02:13.476
- Just let me figure out...
- What species?

02:15.445 --> 02:17.003
I'm human.

02:23.125 --> 02:26.913
- You're from the Earth vessel.
- Degra, you have to listen to me.

02:27.445 --> 02:29.163
I'm not your enemy anymore.

02:29.285 --> 02:32.755
You've spent the last two days
in an interrogation chamber.

02:32.885 --> 02:37.401
Whatever the Insectoids did to you in
there must have affected your memory.

02:39.285 --> 02:42.675
My name is Jonathan Archer.

02:43.205 --> 02:46.038
The two of us just escaped from
an Insectoid prison colony.

02:46.165 --> 02:47.200
Prison?

02:47.325 --> 02:51.238
We've shared a cell
for almost three years.

02:52.365 --> 02:54.515
That's not possible.

02:56.125 --> 02:58.002
Roll up your sleeve.

03:08.045 --> 03:10.843
The conflict between our people is over.

03:11.605 --> 03:13.914
We both lost.

03:15.365 --> 03:17.720
I promise I'll explain everything.

03:17.845 --> 03:19.244
But right now
we have to get out of here...

03:19.365 --> 03:21.196
before our friends out there
repair their engines.

03:21.325 --> 03:22.314
What are you doing?

03:22.445 --> 03:24.595
There's a system
about a week from here.

03:24.725 --> 03:28.115
It's isolated.
I doubt they'll look for us there.

03:50.285 --> 03:52.560
It's been a long road

03:54.325 --> 03:57.283
Gettin' from there to here

03:57.405 --> 03:59.873
It's been a long time

04:01.325 --> 04:04.203
But my time is finally near

04:05.045 --> 04:08.082
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

04:09.125 --> 04:11.844
I will touch the sky

04:12.165 --> 04:15.794
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

04:16.084 --> 04:18.678
No, they're not gonna change my mind

04:18.805 --> 04:23.003
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

04:23.885 --> 04:26.524
I'm going where my heart will take me

04:26.645 --> 04:30.399
I've got faith to believe

04:31.285 --> 04:33.879
I can do anything

04:34.005 --> 04:37.759
I've got strength of the soul

04:38.645 --> 04:41.239
And no one's gonna bend or break me

04:41.365 --> 04:45.153
I can reach any star

04:46.925 --> 04:49.280
I've got faith

04:50.565 --> 04:52.999
I've got faith

04:54.285 --> 04:57.402
Faith of the heart

05:07.405 --> 05:10.761
You expect me to believe
my own people would hold me prisoner?

05:12.125 --> 05:13.444
You think that's amusing?

05:13.565 --> 05:15.635
It's been a while
since you referred to those...

05:16.885 --> 05:18.682
overgrown grasshoppers
as your "own people."

05:18.805 --> 05:20.955
Why don't I remember you?

05:21.365 --> 05:24.835
- Probably because of the bloodworms.
- Bloodworms?

05:24.965 --> 05:26.683
They're used during interrogations.

05:26.805 --> 05:31.640
Their secretions act as a truth serum.
Makes the prisoners more cooperative.

05:31.805 --> 05:33.079
But there's a side effect.

05:33.205 --> 05:35.560
Sometimes they can
suppress memories.

05:35.685 --> 05:37.801
The same thing happened
when they questioned me.

05:37.925 --> 05:40.598
I forgot everything that happened
since flight school.

05:40.725 --> 05:42.920
It'll start to come back to you.
Give it a few days.

05:43.045 --> 05:45.275
You claim that I've been
a prisoner for three years.

05:45.405 --> 05:46.360
Three years.

05:46.565 --> 05:49.602
It that's true, why would they
question me now?

05:50.005 --> 05:53.714
They wanted information
about the weapon.

05:53.845 --> 05:56.439
What kind of information?

05:59.725 --> 06:02.034
This is going to take some time.

06:04.245 --> 06:06.713
What's the last thing you remember?

06:07.165 --> 06:11.841
I was on my vessel, approaching a
planet in the Calindra system.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.404
The weapon test.

06:13.525 --> 06:16.119
It failed because your prototype
was sabotaged.

06:16.605 --> 06:18.402
How would you know that?

06:18.525 --> 06:20.436
Because I'm responsible for it.

06:21.405 --> 06:24.522
Your kemocite shipment
was tampered with.

06:24.845 --> 06:26.563
Gralik.

06:27.845 --> 06:28.914
He wasn't happy when I told him

06:29.045 --> 06:31.354
what you were planning to do
with his kemocite.

06:31.485 --> 06:34.045
He'll be executed for this.

06:34.885 --> 06:36.762
He was.

06:40.525 --> 06:43.915
In the end, it didn't make
much of a difference.

06:44.245 --> 06:47.521
We didn't stop your program,
we only slowed it down.

06:50.085 --> 06:52.838
A few weeks later,
the weapon was launched.

06:53.485 --> 06:55.237
It destroyed my planet.

06:59.325 --> 07:01.316
We were successful?

07:02.725 --> 07:05.762
I don't know if you'd call it a success.

07:07.685 --> 07:10.074
After Earth was destroyed...

07:10.485 --> 07:13.079
the old Xindi rivalries surfaced again.

07:13.565 --> 07:16.796
The Insectoids started attacking
other Xindi colonies.

07:16.965 --> 07:19.525
They killed thousands of your people.

07:20.405 --> 07:23.681
The Reptilians and Aquatics
would never allow that.

07:24.285 --> 07:26.674
There wasn't a lot they could do.

07:27.365 --> 07:29.799
While you were busy
constructing the weapon...

07:29.925 --> 07:31.722
the Insectoids...

07:31.845 --> 07:35.076
were secretly building
hundreds of new ships.

07:35.205 --> 07:37.435
They used Earth as a diversion.

07:37.565 --> 07:41.080
Their real goal was to dominate
the other Xindi species.

07:43.085 --> 07:45.280
Are you all right?

07:46.645 --> 07:49.717
It's just a bloodworm.
It'll work its way out.

07:51.965 --> 07:53.876
Can you remove it?

08:16.485 --> 08:17.804
Hold still.

09:12.085 --> 09:14.679
I think you need this more than I do.

09:17.645 --> 09:19.124
Suit yourself.

09:21.845 --> 09:24.917
I don't understand
how a Xindi and a human...

09:25.685 --> 09:28.722
could put aside
their differences so quickly.

09:29.325 --> 09:31.885
Trust me, it didn't happen overnight.

09:32.365 --> 09:35.641
You gave me this the first day
we were locked up together.

09:35.765 --> 09:39.155
The guards thought it would be
entertaining to put us in the same cell.

09:39.285 --> 09:41.753
They even placed wagers
on who would survive the longest.

09:41.885 --> 09:45.764
I was in pretty bad shape at the time,
so you were the odds-on favourite.

09:49.285 --> 09:51.924
Your people killed everyone
I ever cared about.

09:54.325 --> 09:57.522
I was going to make sure
you never walked out of that cell.

09:58.085 --> 10:00.724
For weeks, we tried to kill each other.

10:01.685 --> 10:04.483
I was lying in the infirmary...

10:05.005 --> 10:09.396
when I finally asked myself,
what was the point?

10:11.605 --> 10:15.644
My world was gone, but so was yours.

10:17.565 --> 10:19.556
So I made a proposal.

10:21.685 --> 10:25.519
The two of us would work together
to get out of that place.

10:25.845 --> 10:28.996
It took us longer than
either one of us thought...

10:29.565 --> 10:31.405
but here we are.

10:34.165 --> 10:36.918
I don't recognise this type of ship.

10:37.285 --> 10:39.196
It's a Malosian cargo shuttle.

10:39.525 --> 10:41.481
- Malosian?
- They're traders.

10:41.605 --> 10:45.154
They bring supplies to the prison
a few times a month.

10:47.485 --> 10:49.237
No weapons, but...

10:49.645 --> 10:52.717
she's sturdy enough
to get us where we're going.

10:53.645 --> 10:56.205
Perhaps we should set a course
to your vessel.

10:56.405 --> 10:58.441
Is it still in the Expanse?

11:00.045 --> 11:01.478
Not exactly.

11:05.365 --> 11:08.198
When we were getting close
to finding your weapon...

11:08.325 --> 11:11.044
the Insectoids sent their ships after us.

11:11.925 --> 11:15.076
They boarded Enterprise
and took me prisoner.

11:16.205 --> 11:19.561
Then they planted spatial charges
around our warp reactor.

11:21.045 --> 11:24.196
My crew was still aboard
when they detonated them.

11:29.165 --> 11:32.157
The Insectoids were always
an aggressive species...

11:32.285 --> 11:34.674
but I never thought them capable of this.

11:35.365 --> 11:38.163
They destroyed everything
the Council worked for.

11:38.285 --> 11:39.434
Council?

11:39.565 --> 11:41.442
It was formed
when our planet was destroyed.

11:41.565 --> 11:44.557
It was created to find
a new homeworld for all Xindi.

11:45.365 --> 11:47.799
After years of searching
we found a few...

11:47.925 --> 11:51.998
suitable locations, but as usual,
couldn't agree on a final choice.

11:52.245 --> 11:55.476
Our plan for reunification
was put aside...

11:55.605 --> 11:58.199
when we learned of the
threat from Earth.

11:59.085 --> 12:02.839
I was ordered
to begin designing the weapon.

12:03.725 --> 12:05.363
I devoted years to it.

12:05.485 --> 12:08.795
I made so many sacrifices.
So did my wife.

12:10.925 --> 12:13.519
Do I know...

12:15.245 --> 12:17.156
what happened to my family?

12:17.285 --> 12:19.560
You told me you'd heard from Naara...

12:20.205 --> 12:22.514
before you were sent to prison.

12:22.845 --> 12:24.995
She and the children were safe.

12:32.245 --> 12:34.122
We have a ship now.

12:34.685 --> 12:36.562
We can look for them.

12:37.845 --> 12:40.484
They were on a colony near a red giant.

12:43.525 --> 12:46.085
There's nothing in range.
Do you remember the coordinates?

12:46.205 --> 12:47.354
I doubt there's anything left.

12:47.485 --> 12:50.079
It would've been one of the
first colonies to have been attacked.

12:50.245 --> 12:52.076
There may have been survivors.

12:52.925 --> 12:57.157
It's too dangerous.
The patrol ships are still looking for us.

12:58.125 --> 13:00.514
We should find a refuge in case...

13:02.765 --> 13:06.235
Reactor coolant. The conduit
must have ruptured in the attack.

13:19.845 --> 13:20.834
Take it.

13:20.965 --> 13:23.957
- What about you?
- You're the one with a family.

13:24.485 --> 13:26.555
You want to see them again?

13:29.285 --> 13:31.560
Try to seal the rupture.

13:31.805 --> 13:36.481
I'll see if I can close off
the coolant tanks.

15:18.605 --> 15:19.833
T'Pol.

15:29.045 --> 15:31.923
He should remain unconscious
for at least two hours.

15:32.045 --> 15:34.639
The son of a bitch
designed the weapon.

15:35.925 --> 15:37.597
Keep an eye on him.

15:37.765 --> 15:38.880
Trip.

15:45.485 --> 15:47.237
What have we got?

15:47.365 --> 15:49.595
There are seven red giants
in this region...

15:49.725 --> 15:52.398
but they're spread over approximately
40 light-years.

15:52.525 --> 15:54.197
Can we scan them
for a weapons facility?

15:54.325 --> 15:55.917
Not at this distance.

15:56.045 --> 15:58.354
This red giant might be a red herring.

15:58.485 --> 16:01.363
He only told you his family was
living near one of these stars.

16:01.485 --> 16:03.043
We don't know that the weapon's there.

16:03.165 --> 16:05.963
Degra's a senior official.
We know he's designing the weapon.

16:06.085 --> 16:08.440
There's a chance
he'd keep his family close by.

16:08.565 --> 16:10.795
For a moment, I thought he was
going to give you the coordinates.

16:10.925 --> 16:14.440
Too bad he didn't go for the Andorian
ale. That would've loosened him up.

16:14.565 --> 16:16.601
You appear to have gained his trust.

16:16.725 --> 16:19.285
Perhaps you should try
a more direct approach.

16:19.405 --> 16:20.679
What do you mean?

16:20.805 --> 16:23.273
Ask him where the weapon
is being constructed.

16:23.405 --> 16:25.077
It's too risky.

16:25.285 --> 16:29.358
If he suspects something, we'll end up
right back where we started.

16:30.445 --> 16:32.163
He'll tell me.

16:35.125 --> 16:37.125
I just need a little more time.

16:40.565 --> 16:44.080
Captain's Starlog, December 12, 2153.

16:44.365 --> 16:45.480
We've returned to the site...

16:45.605 --> 16:47.994
where the Xindi were testing
the prototype weapon.

16:48.125 --> 16:51.003
An analysis of the debris
may tell us more about it.

16:52.365 --> 16:55.038
I'm picking up a ship
at the edge of the system.

16:57.165 --> 16:58.837
It's Xindi.

16:59.605 --> 17:00.879
Why didn't we see it before?

17:01.005 --> 17:04.474
It may have been travelling through
one of the subspace vortices they use.

17:04.605 --> 17:08.154
Its hull signature matches the Xindi
ships that were here two days ago.

17:08.285 --> 17:10.878
Captain, I'm reading
three bio-signs on board.

17:11.005 --> 17:12.915
Have they seen us yet?

17:13.045 --> 17:14.922
I don't believe so.

17:20.125 --> 17:21.762
Set course for the inner moon.

17:21.885 --> 17:24.160
Stand by to deploy the sensor drones.

17:25.885 --> 17:28.683
- What's that?
- Weapons fire.

17:28.805 --> 17:30.238
From where?

17:30.405 --> 17:32.999
There's a ship closing.
It's a human vessel.

17:33.125 --> 17:35.241
You said there was
no one in the system!

17:35.365 --> 17:37.720
They must have been hiding
in the debris.

17:39.725 --> 17:41.443
Contact the Council!

17:41.845 --> 17:44.234
They've disabled our
subspace transceiver!

17:44.365 --> 17:46.037
They're making a run for it.

17:46.165 --> 17:48.440
See what you can do
about their engines.

17:54.485 --> 17:56.760
They're not going anywhere, sir.

17:57.125 --> 17:58.604
Hail them.

18:00.405 --> 18:02.635
Stand down and prepare to be boarded.

18:02.885 --> 18:04.113
Thalen.

18:16.605 --> 18:18.084
Anything?

18:18.565 --> 18:20.760
They were attempting to erase
the computer core...

18:20.885 --> 18:22.079
when we boarded the ship.

18:22.205 --> 18:25.561
- There's very little data left.
- What about navigational logs?

18:27.005 --> 18:28.802
They've been deleted.

18:29.045 --> 18:31.275
I may have something here, sir.

18:32.125 --> 18:34.798
I think these are fragments
from a personal file.

18:34.965 --> 18:37.399
There are parts of a letter
from someone named...

18:37.525 --> 18:38.958
"Degra."

18:40.125 --> 18:42.480
- Does it mention the weapon?
- No.

18:43.645 --> 18:46.876
There's a reference
to a planet he visited recently.

18:47.125 --> 18:48.604
Azati Prime.

18:48.725 --> 18:50.955
Let me know what else you find.

18:52.925 --> 18:55.485
I'd love to spend an afternoon
taking this engine apart.

18:55.605 --> 18:58.244
Not your typical nacelle configuration?

18:58.365 --> 19:01.596
Look how everything's tied in
through their main deflector.

19:01.725 --> 19:03.761
Learn everything you can.

19:22.805 --> 19:25.194
I want to know
where you're building the weapon.

19:25.325 --> 19:28.635
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- The hell you don't.

19:30.125 --> 19:31.683
Your name is Degra.

19:32.085 --> 19:36.363
I was at the Xindi colony when you
picked up your shipment of kemocite.

19:39.525 --> 19:42.164
Your people are
planning another attack.

19:43.125 --> 19:45.480
I'm not going to let that happen.

19:46.925 --> 19:50.395
By capturing us,
you've accomplished nothing.

19:51.645 --> 19:53.522
Where's the weapon?

19:56.685 --> 19:59.961
- Archer to the Bridge, report.
- There's a surge in the plasma network.

20:00.085 --> 20:03.600
- What's causing it?
- Radiation from the debris field.

20:03.725 --> 20:05.443
It's starting to affect our systems.

20:05.565 --> 20:08.875
Sir, I recommend putting a safe
distance between us and the test site.

20:09.005 --> 20:12.122
All right. Take the ship
out of the field but keep us close by.

20:12.245 --> 20:13.598
Understood.

20:20.685 --> 20:24.963
If you won't tell me what I need to know,
perhaps one of your men will.

20:26.965 --> 20:31.595
When my superiors learn we're missing,
they'll find your ship and destroy it.

20:33.845 --> 20:35.961
We could try a truth serum...

20:36.085 --> 20:39.521
but it could take weeks to synthesise
the correct formula.

20:40.045 --> 20:42.764
I've been studying
Xindi neurophysiology.

20:43.125 --> 20:46.800
It may be possible to erase his most
recent memory engrams.

20:47.045 --> 20:51.163
That way, Degra will never know that he
came aboard or that he met any of us.

20:51.605 --> 20:53.800
But this is a Xindi-Reptilian.

20:53.925 --> 20:55.722
Would it work on a Primate?

20:57.205 --> 20:59.639
Their neural pathways are
virtually identical.

20:59.765 --> 21:03.678
I'll need to perform a few tests,
but I don't expect it will be a problem.

21:03.805 --> 21:06.365
How selective could this
memory wipe be?

21:06.485 --> 21:10.364
I've built flight simulators for Starfleet
training. This wouldn't be that different.

21:10.485 --> 21:14.000
It's not simply a matter of constructing
a shuttle. It has to be designed.

21:14.125 --> 21:17.435
What species built it? What language
will the control interface use?

21:17.565 --> 21:18.884
Hoshi can help with that.

21:19.005 --> 21:21.883
I've recovered a letter Degra wrote
to his wife a few months ago.

21:22.005 --> 21:24.678
Her name's Naara.
They have two children.

21:24.805 --> 21:26.602
It may be necessary
to communicate with you...

21:26.725 --> 21:28.044
while you're inside the simulator.

21:28.165 --> 21:30.918
The MACOs use
subdermal transceivers.

21:31.285 --> 21:33.435
They're relatively easy to implant.

21:34.485 --> 21:35.918
Let's get started.

21:36.365 --> 21:39.084
T'Pol, I could use your help
with some of the details.

21:39.205 --> 21:40.354
Details?

21:40.525 --> 21:42.516
If he buys into this,
Degra's gonna want to know...

21:42.645 --> 21:44.840
everything that's happened
in the last three years.

21:44.965 --> 21:47.433
I can't make up the whole story
on the spot.

21:55.725 --> 21:57.636
- Nice work.
- Thank you.

21:58.285 --> 22:00.674
Dermal art used to be
very common on Denobula.

22:00.805 --> 22:03.842
Fortunately, my parents
insisted I study it.

22:04.565 --> 22:07.443
I've also stimulated his hair follicles.

22:08.365 --> 22:10.276
I'm not sure about the grey.

22:11.045 --> 22:13.479
This is only supposed to be three
years from now.

22:13.605 --> 22:17.723
But you're forgetting about the
stress of imprisonment. And torture!

22:17.845 --> 22:20.837
It could very well have an effect
on hair pigmentation.

22:26.965 --> 22:30.196
- You're sure these are safe?
- Oh, yes.

22:30.805 --> 22:33.114
I've treated patients with...

22:33.245 --> 22:35.884
Regulan bloodworms for years.

22:36.005 --> 22:39.122
There should be no side effects
aside from a thoroughly cleansed...

22:39.245 --> 22:40.963
lymphatic system.

22:41.085 --> 22:43.918
Please try not to injure it.
They're difficult to replace.

22:44.045 --> 22:45.603
I'll do my best.

22:58.205 --> 22:59.718
What is it?

22:59.845 --> 23:02.917
Spatial anomalies.
We're passing through a field of them.

23:04.165 --> 23:05.757
Hold on!

23:08.725 --> 23:12.434
T'Pol to Cargo Bay 2.
Increase hydraulics to level six.

23:16.165 --> 23:19.714
- Is the hull lined with trellium?
- Obviously not.

23:21.165 --> 23:23.201
Increase to level seven.

23:23.405 --> 23:26.522
On my mark,
initiate a sharp jolt to starboard.

23:26.645 --> 23:28.601
How sharp do you want it?

23:29.725 --> 23:31.363
Sharp.

23:31.845 --> 23:33.563
You heard the lady.

23:33.925 --> 23:35.881
Let the Captain know.

23:36.445 --> 23:38.640
This is going to be a rough one, sir.

23:45.925 --> 23:49.964
We're losing structural integrity!
I'm taking us out of warp.

23:58.405 --> 24:01.715
We'll never make it through this field
in one piece.

24:04.045 --> 24:05.842
Can we go around?

24:08.165 --> 24:09.803
We don't have enough fuel.

24:12.965 --> 24:15.195
We should send a distress call.

24:16.165 --> 24:18.963
One of your ships
might be close enough to hear it.

24:19.085 --> 24:21.155
What if the Insectoids pick it up?

24:22.725 --> 24:24.955
We don't have a lot of choices.

24:26.645 --> 24:29.603
There's a comm channel used by
high-ranking Primate officials.

24:29.725 --> 24:31.681
I doubt the Insectoids know it.

24:33.125 --> 24:34.797
What's the frequency?

24:34.925 --> 24:37.917
It would be easier for me
to enter it directly.

24:48.405 --> 24:49.838
Ensign?

24:53.765 --> 24:54.993
I've got it.

24:55.125 --> 24:58.197
- Stand by to respond.
- Bridge to Command Centre.

24:58.325 --> 24:59.644
Go ahead.

24:59.765 --> 25:03.041
I'm picking up a distortion in subspace.
I believe it's a Xindi ship.

25:03.165 --> 25:05.725
- How long until they arrive?
- About six hours.

25:05.845 --> 25:09.838
Their sensors are pretty sophisticated.
They might see us long before then.

25:10.085 --> 25:13.680
Lieutenant, take us back
into the debris field.

25:13.845 --> 25:15.915
The radiation could
overload our systems again.

25:16.045 --> 25:17.956
I'm aware of the risks.

25:18.685 --> 25:21.563
- Carry out my orders.
- Acknowledged.

25:28.285 --> 25:32.483
One of the inmates told me
all about Maarek Three.

25:33.605 --> 25:36.836
He used it as a staging area
when he was smuggling dilithium.

25:36.965 --> 25:39.115
What did he say it was like?

25:39.805 --> 25:41.636
Beautiful.

25:42.685 --> 25:45.961
With beaches that go on
for thousands of kilometres.

25:48.325 --> 25:50.043
First thing I'm going to do...

25:50.165 --> 25:52.156
is find a cold lake...

25:52.285 --> 25:54.958
and take the longest bath of my life.

25:57.845 --> 26:00.882
It sounded a lot like Earth,
the way he described it.

26:06.085 --> 26:07.996
The Captain's certainly drinking a lot.

26:08.125 --> 26:10.593
The Doctor gave him an anti-intoxicant.

26:11.325 --> 26:15.204
This colony of yours,
you never told me about it.

26:15.325 --> 26:18.874
It was bleak, desolate.
The planet was barely habitable.

26:19.005 --> 26:20.643
Why'd you live there?

26:20.765 --> 26:22.960
It wasn't by choice.

26:23.485 --> 26:25.157
Naara was desperate to leave.

26:25.285 --> 26:29.483
She didn't think a military habitat was
the right environment for the children.

26:30.365 --> 26:33.994
Do you have a family, Captain?

26:37.245 --> 26:39.998
It's been a long time
since anyone called me "Captain."

26:40.125 --> 26:42.036
It's Jonathan, remember?

26:43.045 --> 26:46.037
I never really had
an opportunity to start one.

26:47.885 --> 26:49.921
I was away from home a lot.

26:50.925 --> 26:53.200
You should make the time.

26:54.005 --> 26:57.520
I've learned that our work,
in the end, means very little.

26:58.605 --> 27:00.880
Our real legacy is the children.

27:04.165 --> 27:07.521
I would do anything to protect mine.

27:09.645 --> 27:12.523
After I was told of the threat...

27:13.365 --> 27:14.957
from humanity...

27:15.845 --> 27:19.884
I left my theoretical studies and
agreed to design the prototype weapon.

27:20.525 --> 27:23.164
When it arrived in your star system...

27:23.765 --> 27:27.599
I watched the incoming telemetry with
the other members of the Council.

27:28.925 --> 27:31.359
Seven million lives...

27:32.845 --> 27:35.484
were extinguished in front of my eyes.

27:36.325 --> 27:37.963
I asked myself...

27:38.565 --> 27:41.682
how many of those were children?

27:45.645 --> 27:48.034
I suppose I've told you this before.

27:51.285 --> 27:53.515
Actually, you haven't.

27:53.645 --> 27:54.794
Three years!

27:54.925 --> 27:58.525
My children may not even
recognise me after so much.

28:07.285 --> 28:08.957
We're being hailed.

28:11.365 --> 28:14.641
Whoever it is,
they must be pretty far away.

28:14.765 --> 28:16.721
I'll try to clear it up.

28:16.965 --> 28:19.081
Are you receiving this transmission?

28:19.205 --> 28:23.198
This is Thalen, responding to your
distress call. Please acknowledge.

28:23.325 --> 28:25.441
It's one of my colleagues.

28:25.565 --> 28:28.637
Thalen! Can you hear me? It's Degra!

28:28.765 --> 28:31.438
Degra? It's good to hear your voice.

28:31.645 --> 28:35.843
I'd heard from my sources that you'd
been captured by the Insectoids.

28:35.965 --> 28:38.525
There were reports
that you'd been executed.

28:38.645 --> 28:40.954
They haven't killed me yet.
I need your help.

28:41.085 --> 28:43.883
My friend and I have escaped
from an Insectoid prison.

28:44.005 --> 28:46.075
Their patrols are looking for us.

28:46.205 --> 28:48.765
I'm losing your signal. Please repeat.

28:48.885 --> 28:50.637
Better make it fast!

28:51.245 --> 28:54.123
Thalen, where are you?

28:54.245 --> 28:57.442
I'm on Azati Prime. It's safe here.

28:57.565 --> 29:00.284
Is my family still there? Are they safe?

29:00.765 --> 29:02.278
Thalen!

29:02.725 --> 29:04.955
Naara is here, and the children.

29:05.085 --> 29:07.280
I'll tell them to expect you.

29:13.645 --> 29:15.442
At least you know they're all right.

29:15.565 --> 29:19.353
There were more than 1,000
Primates and Arboreals at that colony.

29:19.485 --> 29:22.204
I don't understand
why it wasn't destroyed.

29:22.325 --> 29:25.522
We should still change course.
Do you know the coordinates?

29:30.405 --> 29:33.203
- What's wrong?
- You must forgive me.

29:34.565 --> 29:37.238
To me, it's been only a day
since we were enemies.

29:37.365 --> 29:40.675
Giving you the coordinates
to a classified installation is...

29:41.605 --> 29:43.118
difficult.

29:43.325 --> 29:44.838
Be my guest.

29:49.685 --> 29:50.959
They're coming in.

29:51.085 --> 29:54.998
1127.4 by 4052...

29:55.125 --> 29:57.798
by 3901.1.

30:00.445 --> 30:01.844
A red giant.

30:02.045 --> 30:04.081
Open a comm line to the Captain.

30:08.565 --> 30:12.353
- You encrypted the navigation controls.
- Yes.

30:12.605 --> 30:16.314
Captain, the coordinates match
the location of one of the red giants.

30:16.965 --> 30:20.355
Do you mind if I ask how long
it will take to get there?

30:20.485 --> 30:22.077
Not long.

30:22.205 --> 30:24.435
Approximately three weeks
at maximum warp.

30:24.565 --> 30:27.284
A considerable detour
if the weapon isn't there.

30:37.365 --> 30:40.277
What will your people think
when you show up with me?

30:41.485 --> 30:44.045
Humans probably aren't
their favourite species.

30:44.445 --> 30:46.834
I'll tell them everything
you did to help me.

30:46.965 --> 30:49.798
I'm a senior official.
There won't be any problems.

30:52.045 --> 30:53.717
I appreciate that.

30:53.845 --> 30:55.836
It's a diverse community.

30:55.965 --> 30:59.002
Far more pleasant than most military...

31:02.325 --> 31:03.599
Travis?

31:03.725 --> 31:06.114
The port hydraulics are acting up.

31:11.685 --> 31:13.323
Shut them down.

31:15.725 --> 31:17.363
They're not responding.

31:17.485 --> 31:19.680
T'Pol to Cargo Bay 2. Report.

31:19.805 --> 31:23.002
The radiation from the debris is
overloading the hydraulic system.

31:23.125 --> 31:25.764
- Can you stabilise the simulator?
- I'm working on it.

31:25.885 --> 31:28.877
- More anomalies?
- I'm not sure.

31:29.005 --> 31:31.565
Captain, we're having some problems.
Stand by.

31:33.205 --> 31:34.957
T'Pol to the Bridge.

31:35.085 --> 31:37.645
- Take us out of the debris field.
- Understood.

31:53.565 --> 31:55.476
Bridge to the Command Centre.

31:55.605 --> 31:57.243
We're clear of the debris field.

31:57.365 --> 32:00.038
- Acknowledged.
- What was the problem?

32:01.085 --> 32:04.316
- Subspace turbulence.
- Really?

32:10.245 --> 32:13.920
I'm curious, Jonathan.

32:16.085 --> 32:19.077
If we've been friends
for as long as you say...

32:19.405 --> 32:22.442
I must have told you
the names of my children.

32:22.565 --> 32:24.203
You still don't believe me, do you?

32:24.325 --> 32:26.441
There's something in his hand.

32:26.565 --> 32:27.884
Magnify.

32:28.005 --> 32:29.916
It's been years
since you've said anything.

32:30.045 --> 32:31.637
Captain, he has a weapon.

32:31.765 --> 32:35.360
I just need you to tell me
what their names are.

32:35.725 --> 32:37.363
We're coming in.

32:37.485 --> 32:40.682
- This isn't necessary.
- Piral and Jaina.

32:42.165 --> 32:43.883
Piral and Jaina.

32:45.805 --> 32:47.636
Which one is older?

32:51.005 --> 32:52.802
It's not in here, sir.

33:13.685 --> 33:15.835
You'll never find the weapon.

33:16.205 --> 33:18.002
Take him to the Brig.

33:38.125 --> 33:40.275
We were told humans were ruthless.

33:41.085 --> 33:44.714
But I didn't know you were
also skilled at deception.

33:44.845 --> 33:46.483
When did you realise?

33:46.605 --> 33:49.244
I had my suspicions
from the beginning...

33:49.685 --> 33:51.835
but it was the comm signal...

33:51.965 --> 33:55.162
from my colleague on Azati Prime
that confirmed them.

33:55.285 --> 33:57.560
We know your ship has been there.

33:57.685 --> 33:58.800
Recently.

33:59.445 --> 34:03.677
There's an Insectoid deuterium
facility on Azati Prime.

34:03.805 --> 34:07.514
That's the last place my people
would have gone to hide from them.

34:07.645 --> 34:11.717
If it weren't for that one mistake,
your plan might have succeeded.

34:11.925 --> 34:14.723
You gave us the coordinates
of a red giant.

34:15.165 --> 34:17.076
I gave you...

34:17.764 --> 34:20.233
what you thought...

34:20.885 --> 34:22.204
you wanted.

34:25.165 --> 34:28.043
I guess I'll just have to wipe
your memory clean again.

34:28.165 --> 34:31.475
Go back into the simulator
and start this whole thing over.

34:31.645 --> 34:33.362
I doubt there's time for that.

34:33.485 --> 34:35.873
We both know my people
are searching for me.

34:36.005 --> 34:39.315
I think you didn't figure it out
until after the malfunction.

34:40.405 --> 34:43.397
I'd be willing to bet
those coordinates are real.

34:44.125 --> 34:48.437
Then I suggest you proceed there
at maximum warp!

34:48.605 --> 34:51.438
Why would he encrypt the coordinates
if they weren't accurate?

34:51.565 --> 34:54.318
Perhaps he thought it would make them
appear more convincing.

34:54.445 --> 34:56.117
He's got to be lying, sir.

34:56.245 --> 35:00.523
Something must have happened during
the radiation surge that tipped him off.

35:00.765 --> 35:04.121
We can't afford to lose three weeks
if the weapon isn't there.

35:06.325 --> 35:09.954
Have you learned anything more about
how they open the subspace vortices?

35:10.085 --> 35:12.599
They use some kind of
phase deflector pulses.

35:12.725 --> 35:14.238
Once they're in...

35:14.365 --> 35:18.324
their ships can travel half a dozen
light-years in a couple of minutes.

35:19.965 --> 35:22.433
I want to see
all the data you've collected.

35:33.845 --> 35:36.234
Archer to the Bridge. We're ready.

35:37.165 --> 35:38.757
Tactical Alert.

35:40.805 --> 35:42.318
Engage.

36:04.205 --> 36:06.435
- Open it.
- Sir.

36:10.165 --> 36:13.601
You two, come with me. I said move!

36:17.485 --> 36:20.318
We'll fracture the hull
if this goes on any longer.

36:24.005 --> 36:26.200
Hull breaches on Decks D and E.

36:26.325 --> 36:28.043
Emergency bulkheads!

36:28.165 --> 36:29.644
- You're the engineer?
- Yes.

36:29.765 --> 36:30.800
You're going to help us.

36:30.925 --> 36:32.438
We adapted your technology...

36:32.565 --> 36:34.760
used our main deflector
to open a subspace vortex.

36:34.885 --> 36:36.523
That's impossible.

36:37.365 --> 36:41.404
The vortex is starting to collapse.
I need you to stabilise it.

36:41.645 --> 36:45.194
If you don't do what he says,
this ship will break apart.

36:48.885 --> 36:50.637
Lieutenant!

36:51.845 --> 36:53.642
Tell him to do what he's told.

36:53.765 --> 36:55.642
Do nothing to help them!

36:58.165 --> 36:59.234
The pylons are buckling!

37:02.285 --> 37:05.083
Engineering, we're losing hull integrity.

37:19.645 --> 37:22.796
- Trip!
- It wasn't me, Captain.

37:24.045 --> 37:25.603
I'll be damned.

37:26.285 --> 37:28.515
Travis inverted the warp field.

37:29.205 --> 37:32.641
- It dropped us back into normal space.
- T'Pol to Captain Archer.

37:33.285 --> 37:36.118
- Go ahead.
- Please report to the Bridge.

37:39.445 --> 37:41.436
Take him back to the Brig.

37:51.365 --> 37:53.435
- Report.
- We've reached the coordinates.

37:53.565 --> 37:55.317
Ensign, magnify.

37:59.925 --> 38:02.041
I'm picking up several Xindi vessels.

38:02.165 --> 38:04.804
I'm also reading significant quantities
of kemocite.

38:04.925 --> 38:06.483
What's our status?

38:06.605 --> 38:08.357
Minimal damage.

38:08.485 --> 38:10.362
The hull plating is coming back online.

38:10.485 --> 38:12.203
Arm all weapons.

38:13.045 --> 38:16.799
Lay in a course for those
kemocite signatures. Full impulse.

38:20.005 --> 38:21.518
Get him out of here.

38:22.325 --> 38:24.202
You'll never get close to the weapon!

38:24.325 --> 38:27.601
Our defence perimeter will destroy you!

38:41.565 --> 38:43.044
Show him.

38:52.365 --> 38:55.323
Thanks for your help.
Take him to Sickbay.

39:13.245 --> 39:16.794
I think you overdid the turbulence
just a little, Ensign.

39:17.045 --> 39:19.605
I'll try to do better next time, sir.

39:30.365 --> 39:32.321
How's it coming?

39:32.645 --> 39:35.876
We've made it appear
as if a plasma conduit ruptured...

39:36.045 --> 39:37.842
rendering them unconscious.

39:37.965 --> 39:42.436
I'm injecting them with trace amounts
of the plasma. It won't be harmful.

39:43.605 --> 39:46.995
This accident won't explain
how their computer core was deleted.

39:47.205 --> 39:51.164
As long as they don't know we were
here, we can leave them with a mystery.

39:52.205 --> 39:53.399
Go ahead.

39:53.525 --> 39:56.119
The Xindi vessel
is less than an hour away, sir.

39:59.165 --> 40:01.440
Captain's Starlog, supplemental.

40:01.565 --> 40:05.035
Hopefully the journey to Azati Prime
will be the final leg in our search...

40:05.165 --> 40:06.917
for the Xindi weapon.
