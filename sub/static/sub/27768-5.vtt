00:58.262 --> 01:01.462
Shall we call it a day?
 Not yet.

01:01.810 --> 01:03.290
Looks like a storm's in the post.

01:03.290 --> 01:05.930
Since when's a bit of weather
stopped us?

01:05.930 --> 01:07.330
I'm just saying!

01:07.330 --> 01:09.410
If you want to go, then go!

01:09.410 --> 01:11.250
Come on, Ray. You heard him.

01:11.250 --> 01:12.890
Pint?

01:12.890 --> 01:14.770
Oh, sounds like a plan to me.

01:18.610 --> 01:20.690
BLEEPING

01:31.890 --> 01:33.570
What is it?

02:05.450 --> 02:07.250
Four pints of Lighthaven Gold.

02:07.250 --> 02:08.970
Cheers, love.

02:08.970 --> 02:11.170
Late-night skinny-dipping?

02:11.170 --> 02:12.490
I asked for cider.

02:12.490 --> 02:15.730
Well, I thought Lighthaven Gold
seemed appropriate, considering.

02:15.730 --> 02:17.530
Keep your voice down!

02:17.530 --> 02:19.610
Any luck today, Errol?

02:19.610 --> 02:22.290
Not this time. Well, don't give up.

02:22.290 --> 02:25.050
There be treasure out
there somewhere! Har-har!

02:26.930 --> 02:29.090
If word gets out we struck gold,

02:29.090 --> 02:32.530
we'll have every treasure hunter
in the south-west on our patch.

02:32.530 --> 02:34.690
Who's to say there isn't more?

02:38.530 --> 02:40.610
According to club rules,

02:40.610 --> 02:44.330
all finds must be divided equally
amongst those present.

02:46.450 --> 02:49.410
So... So let's divvy it up!
Leave it!

02:51.890 --> 02:53.690
We only want our fair share.

02:53.690 --> 02:55.570
You'll get it.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.610
But we're doing this properly.

03:00.250 --> 03:03.130
Who are you calling?
The coroner's office.

03:03.130 --> 03:05.650
I have to report the find.
It's the law.

03:05.650 --> 03:10.450
Until then, I'm not letting
these coins out of my sight.

03:10.450 --> 03:12.450
HE COUGHS

03:35.290 --> 03:37.250
THUNDERCLAP

03:37.250 --> 03:39.290
HE COUGHS

03:47.210 --> 03:49.050
BANGING

03:51.890 --> 03:53.650
BANGING

03:53.650 --> 03:55.130
THUNDERCLAP

03:55.130 --> 03:56.930
Who's there?!

03:56.930 --> 03:58.410
BANGING

03:59.610 --> 04:01.130
THUNDERCLAP

04:06.890 --> 04:08.810
SQUAWKING

04:18.410 --> 04:20.529
TICKING

04:46.010 --> 04:48.290
Beth? Get in here!

04:53.810 --> 04:55.290
What've I done now?

04:55.290 --> 04:58.370
"Regarding last week's piece
on Lighthaven's haunted churches,

04:58.370 --> 04:59.810
"please report on actual news

04:59.810 --> 05:02.930
"and not the superstitious ramblings
of the permanently deluded."

05:02.930 --> 05:05.330
You didn't tell me about this.
What's the big deal?

05:05.330 --> 05:08.330
My little girl's got her name
in print! Did I miss something?

05:08.330 --> 05:11.210
Only that your granddaughter's
now a published writer.

05:11.210 --> 05:13.810
I just think it's stupid
they're talking about ghosts

05:13.810 --> 05:15.250
as though they actually exist.

05:15.250 --> 05:17.290
I thought you were into
all that gory stuff.

05:17.290 --> 05:20.290
A corpse is fascinating enough
without Casper popping out of it.

05:20.290 --> 05:21.610
You should keep an open mind.

05:21.610 --> 05:24.290
Your mum reckons someone's found
Long Ben's treasure.

05:24.290 --> 05:25.970
I said nothing about Long Ben.

05:25.970 --> 05:29.010
Who's Long B...? Not another one
of your ex-boyfriends?

05:29.010 --> 05:30.930
A silly local legend.

05:30.930 --> 05:32.930
Long Ben's Pirate Curse.

05:32.930 --> 05:35.370
A vicious pirate, fatally-wounded,

05:35.370 --> 05:37.810
clambers on shore
to bury his treasure.

05:37.810 --> 05:42.570
Before he dies, he vows to return
and slaughter anyone who touches it.

05:42.570 --> 05:44.450
Yeah, right!
We both know the only thing

05:44.450 --> 05:46.730
that's cursed around here
is Mum's love life.

05:51.730 --> 05:53.410
What's this got to do with us?

05:53.410 --> 05:55.450
Aw, did they find Long Ben's bones?

05:55.450 --> 05:58.330
Treasure falls under
the remit of the Coroner's Office.

05:58.330 --> 06:00.290
We need to confirm
who found what, when.

06:00.290 --> 06:02.970
Fine, but I'm not touching it.
I don't want to catch the curse.

06:02.970 --> 06:05.730
You make it sound like
it's a disease!

06:05.730 --> 06:08.810
It's our responsibility
to establish facts, Clint.

06:08.810 --> 06:10.530
Anyway, there's no such thing as...

06:17.650 --> 06:20.050
You were quick.
I've only just called the office.

06:20.050 --> 06:21.570
You'd better come inside.

06:35.690 --> 06:38.410
It's a shot from the inside
with an air rifle.

06:41.090 --> 06:44.010
Oh! What IS that?

06:44.010 --> 06:46.170
That is Errol Prowse.

06:48.090 --> 06:50.290
He made a 999 call at 2:15am

06:50.290 --> 06:53.050
saying that someone
was coming to kill him.

06:53.050 --> 06:56.050
By the time our boys got here,
they found the front and rear doors
bolted

06:56.050 --> 06:57.610
and the victim was already dead.

06:57.610 --> 07:00.490
He looks scared. He smells scared.

07:00.490 --> 07:02.770
Yeah. No obvious wound, though.

07:02.770 --> 07:05.570
Seizure maybe, if he worked
himself up into a state.

07:05.570 --> 07:08.330
What, you're saying
he frightened himself to death?

07:08.330 --> 07:10.530
No, I'm saying I'm not ruling out
natural causes.

07:10.530 --> 07:12.530
What about the supernatural causes?

07:12.530 --> 07:15.330
Ignore him. Why don't you go to
the car and get a report form?

07:18.090 --> 07:19.810
Who's the girl?

07:19.810 --> 07:22.490
Amelia Prowse. Granddaughter.

07:22.490 --> 07:24.570
She was in a nasty car accident
a few years ago.

07:24.570 --> 07:27.250
She survived,
but both her parents were killed.

07:27.250 --> 07:29.650
Man of few words. Yeah.

07:29.650 --> 07:32.250
She lives here?
Yeah. No sign of her, though.

07:32.250 --> 07:34.330
Been trying to phone her mobile.

07:34.330 --> 07:35.970
The coins.

07:38.170 --> 07:40.970
You said he called you about them?
Yeah. Just after 9:00.

07:40.970 --> 07:43.730
No, don't open it. We need to avoid
exposing it to the elements.

07:43.730 --> 07:45.770
Has it been dusted for prints?
Yeah. Great.

07:45.770 --> 07:48.210
Whoa! Hang on.
That's evidence, that.

07:48.210 --> 07:50.370
Treasure's my jurisdiction.

07:50.370 --> 07:53.010
Don't worry, I'll let you read
the report.

07:53.010 --> 07:54.210
Where's Grandad?

07:54.210 --> 07:55.530
Amelia? Grandad?

07:55.530 --> 07:57.610
No! No! Grandad!

07:57.610 --> 07:59.810
No! What's happened?!

07:59.810 --> 08:01.530
No! Ah!

08:05.850 --> 08:07.850
He took me in after my parents died.

08:10.130 --> 08:11.650
Where were you last night?

08:13.970 --> 08:17.290
Exeter. It was my birthday
a couple of days ago.

08:17.290 --> 08:20.410
Some mates wanted to take me out.
Sit down.

08:26.010 --> 08:28.050
How did he die?

08:28.050 --> 08:29.290
It's too early to say.

08:32.010 --> 08:36.090
But, you know, your grandfather's
claim should still be honoured.

08:36.090 --> 08:38.130
The coins? Sorry?

08:38.130 --> 08:39.970
He didn't mention it?

08:39.970 --> 08:42.770
I haven't seen him
since breakfast yesterday.

08:42.770 --> 08:45.610
Your grandfather found
some gold coins on the clifftop.

08:45.610 --> 08:48.690
I need to have them assessed to find
out how valuable they are, but...

08:48.690 --> 08:52.530
Wow! I knew he planned on meeting up
with the LTH,

08:52.530 --> 08:54.930
but normally all he comes back with
is a bad mood.

08:54.930 --> 08:56.850
LTH?

08:56.850 --> 08:59.570
Sorry. Lighthaven Treasure Hunters.

08:59.570 --> 09:01.250
He chaired the committee.

09:01.250 --> 09:03.570
Nowadays, there's only four of them.

09:06.610 --> 09:08.730
FAINT POLICE RADIO

09:18.050 --> 09:19.890
'He's outside. He's coming for me!'

09:19.890 --> 09:21.570
'Can you give me your name, sir?'

09:21.570 --> 09:23.610
'It's him! The Captain.'

09:23.610 --> 09:25.650
'Leave me alone!'

09:25.650 --> 09:30.130
GUNSHOT
What did I tell you? Long Ben!

09:30.130 --> 09:32.930
You think Errol was murdered
by a pirate ghost?

09:32.930 --> 09:34.930
Why not? I saw a ghost once.

09:34.930 --> 09:37.290
Seriously, it properly
freaked me out.

09:37.290 --> 09:41.450
It came into my hotel room,
groaned and then wandered off again.

09:41.450 --> 09:44.410
I would've left there and then,
but I was a bit worse for wear.

09:44.410 --> 09:46.490
Scientific proof.
I take it all back(!)

09:46.490 --> 09:50.130
No chance it was just another guest
who got the wrong room, no?

09:50.130 --> 09:51.730
So we're looking for witnesses

09:51.730 --> 09:53.730
and I'll check out the other
treasure hunters,

09:53.730 --> 09:56.410
see if they know anything about
Errol's movements last night.

09:56.410 --> 09:58.410
But I'm pretty certain
it was natural causes.

09:58.410 --> 10:01.530
Natural causes? The guy clearly
thought someone was coming for him.

10:01.530 --> 10:03.410
And I don't believe it was
a dead pirate.

10:03.410 --> 10:05.450
All the doors and windows
were locked,

10:05.450 --> 10:07.490
so, how would a murderer
have got away?

10:07.490 --> 10:09.250
Amelia must have a key.

10:09.250 --> 10:11.090
She was away all night, I checked.

10:11.090 --> 10:12.690
And it was bolted from the inside.

10:12.690 --> 10:15.610
No sign of a struggle. And if
someone had wanted to kill him,

10:15.610 --> 10:17.570
why didn't they take the gold?

10:17.570 --> 10:20.650
No, he was just an old man with
a dickey ticker shooting at shadows.

10:20.650 --> 10:23.010
And judging by the empty
whisky bottles,

10:23.010 --> 10:24.890
he wasn't looking after himself
either.

10:24.890 --> 10:26.370
My gut says foul play.

10:26.370 --> 10:28.650
I've warned you about
Mick's curries.

10:29.810 --> 10:33.090
Either way, I need to get an expert
opinion on these gold coins.

10:33.090 --> 10:35.130
I'm going to meet
the curator at the museum.

10:35.130 --> 10:37.930
The museum gift shop lady!
What's her name?

10:37.930 --> 10:40.530
Isn't she one of
the treasure people? Is she?

10:40.530 --> 10:42.610
In which case, I'm coming with you.

10:42.610 --> 10:45.010
I'm not sure I trust you
with all that gold.

10:58.490 --> 11:00.690
I always wondered
what this place was.

11:07.090 --> 11:08.850
KNOCK AT DOOR

11:14.690 --> 11:17.610
Ah! Jane Kennedy.
Pleasure to meet you, Professor.

11:17.610 --> 11:20.850
Oh, please. Taliesin.
Tali...? Just Tal is fine.

11:20.850 --> 11:23.170
OK. Come in. Thank you.

11:23.170 --> 11:26.130
I was wondering when we'd finally
get to work together.

11:26.130 --> 11:29.130
So I haven't touched the coins,
they're still covered in mud.

11:29.130 --> 11:32.850
Perfect. Layers of sediment can be
as important as the artefact itself

11:32.850 --> 11:35.610
in terms of dating
and identification.

11:35.610 --> 11:37.850
Have you alerted the British Museum?

11:37.850 --> 11:40.170
Not yet. I'm not really sure
what I'm looking at.

11:40.170 --> 11:42.090
Well, I could take a peek.

11:42.090 --> 11:45.010
I've got a small lab set up here,
so... Great! Thank you.

11:45.010 --> 11:47.610
It's where we keep all our
natural history samples.

11:47.610 --> 11:50.970
Weird little sea creatures in
formaldehyde, that kind of thing.

11:50.970 --> 11:55.170
Well, I don't want to distract you,
so I'll just take a look around
the museum, if that's all right?

11:55.170 --> 11:57.450
Sorry!
THEY CHUCKLE

11:58.730 --> 12:00.050
OK, thank you.

12:01.490 --> 12:03.090
Sorry.

12:12.050 --> 12:13.690
So, when did you last see him?

12:13.690 --> 12:17.050
After the pub. We walked Errol back
to his cottage, like bodyguards,

12:17.050 --> 12:18.930
and then I went home.

12:18.930 --> 12:21.010
OK. Can anyone confirm
what time you got back?

12:21.010 --> 12:24.650
Only Alfie. Alfie. Right.

12:24.650 --> 12:26.050
Who's Alfie? My cat.

12:29.650 --> 12:31.730
And how did Errol seem to you
when you left him?

12:31.730 --> 12:34.930
Grumpy, as always. Huh! He thought
he was coming down with something.

12:34.930 --> 12:37.970
That's no surprise when he spends
half his life in the muddy fields

12:37.970 --> 12:39.370
and the other half drinking!

12:39.370 --> 12:41.210
Who else knew about the treasure?

12:41.210 --> 12:43.690
Only the four of us.

12:43.690 --> 12:45.490
Oh, and that coroner Errol called.

12:45.490 --> 12:47.250
You know, you should question him.

12:47.250 --> 12:49.850
Yeah. I'll be sure to check her out.

13:00.570 --> 13:02.810
Bad news? Mass-produced modern fakes.

13:02.810 --> 13:04.610
You sure? They're even stamped

13:04.610 --> 13:06.970
with the initials of the company
that makes them.

13:06.970 --> 13:09.530
Why would someone bury them
on the cliff tops?

13:09.530 --> 13:12.730
A hoax, maybe? I'm sorry.

13:12.730 --> 13:13.810
OK.

13:13.810 --> 13:16.530
I guess our friend wasn't the victim
of a pirate ghost after all.

13:16.530 --> 13:17.890
Pirate ghost?

13:17.890 --> 13:20.530
Long Ben.
Lighthaven's very own Captain Hook.

13:20.530 --> 13:24.130
Except Long Ben was real.
Come with me.

13:34.810 --> 13:39.370
Yeah, it's an arrest warrant
for Captain Henry Avery from 1696.

13:39.370 --> 13:41.450
Long Ben was one of his aliases.

13:41.450 --> 13:43.530
Most of his crew were executed,
but Avery escaped

13:43.530 --> 13:46.290
and no-one ever saw him again. Here.

13:48.090 --> 13:49.850
Pirate treasure? Maybe.

13:49.850 --> 13:52.650
It was found on a beach
half a mile away.

13:52.650 --> 13:54.690
Spanish, but it was minted
in Mexico.

13:54.690 --> 13:57.450
A gold pistole coin,
late 17th century.

13:57.450 --> 13:58.730
And this belonged to Long Ben?

13:58.730 --> 14:01.930
We can't know for sure, but Avery
was born just down the coast.

14:03.290 --> 14:04.970
Many believe he was trying
to get home.

14:04.970 --> 14:06.770
And what about this so-called curse?

14:06.770 --> 14:08.730
The young man who found that coin

14:08.730 --> 14:11.170
died in a freak accident
shortly afterwards.

14:11.170 --> 14:13.930
Before long, stories started.

14:13.930 --> 14:17.730
"Touch the coin and fall victim
to Long Ben's curse!"

14:17.730 --> 14:19.810
You don't believe
there's any truth to it?

14:19.810 --> 14:22.890
Of course I do.
That's why I'm wearing latex gloves.

14:22.890 --> 14:25.490
So, now I'm cursed? Well...

14:25.490 --> 14:27.410
Is there nothing that can save me?

14:28.730 --> 14:30.450
Well, there is one thing.

14:32.370 --> 14:33.970
You can let me buy you lunch.

14:33.970 --> 14:35.810
I know this lovely little place.

14:35.810 --> 14:38.770
If you're going to get murdered
by a pirate ghost,

14:38.770 --> 14:41.250
you might as well make the most
of the time you've got left.

14:42.490 --> 14:44.570
Errol scared off most of
the original members.

14:44.570 --> 14:45.970
Scared off? How?

14:45.970 --> 14:48.130
By being a miserable git,
that's how.

14:48.130 --> 14:51.610
So, why did you stick with it?
You've got to be in it to win it.

14:51.610 --> 14:55.890
The fewer the members, the...
Ahem! ..the bigger the cut.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.770
Right, OK.
Thanks very much, Miss Luscombe.

15:02.490 --> 15:03.970
Just that, thanks.

15:03.970 --> 15:06.210
That'll be ã2.99, then, please.

15:08.050 --> 15:10.850
Skull and crossbones? Bit tasteless,
isn't it, for a coroner?

15:10.850 --> 15:12.090
It's for Beth.

15:12.090 --> 15:14.970
To celebrate the start of her
glittering career in journalism.

15:14.970 --> 15:17.530
Oh. Wow! Thank you.

15:19.010 --> 15:20.570
I know!

15:20.570 --> 15:22.090
Thanks. Bye.

15:22.090 --> 15:24.570
Cynical and convinced
she's always right.

15:24.570 --> 15:26.490
Chip off the old block, ain't she?

15:28.810 --> 15:30.890
Did you notice her shoes?

15:30.890 --> 15:32.330
Stupid question.

15:32.330 --> 15:34.490
They're expensive. Very.

15:34.490 --> 15:37.650
How can she afford those
on a shop wage? Rich boyfriend?

15:37.650 --> 15:40.930
Talking of which, what did
your brainiac say about the coins?

15:40.930 --> 15:44.370
Worthless replicas.
At least he let me hold
some of Long Ben's real treasure.

15:44.370 --> 15:47.330
Ah, the old classic, "Want to touch
a precious artefact?" line.

15:47.330 --> 15:48.970
Hang on a minute,
if you've touched it,

15:48.970 --> 15:51.490
doesn't that mean you're next
on Long Ben's hit list?

15:51.490 --> 15:53.650
Nice try. I don't believe in...
Whoa! Argh!

15:53.650 --> 15:55.130
Argh!

15:55.130 --> 15:57.210
HE CHUCKLES
Pirate curses?

16:05.850 --> 16:07.250
They can't be fake!

16:07.250 --> 16:09.010
An expert examined them and...

16:09.010 --> 16:11.410
Grandad obsessed over old coins.
He would have known.

16:11.410 --> 16:12.930
So, what are you saying?

16:12.930 --> 16:15.850
Someone nicked the real coins
and put the replicas in their place!

16:17.330 --> 16:19.690
Shall we get some fresh air? Come on.

16:25.810 --> 16:27.730
Lived here since my parents died.

16:29.850 --> 16:31.690
I did everything for him.

16:31.690 --> 16:33.850
Shopping, cooking, cleaning.

16:36.250 --> 16:38.170
He was too busy treasure hunting.

16:41.130 --> 16:43.770
Modern replicas
don't qualify as treasure.

16:43.770 --> 16:46.050
The coins my grandad found
were real.

16:46.050 --> 16:48.370
Please understand...
No, you understand!

16:48.370 --> 16:50.570
Grandad's already remortgaged
the cottage.

16:50.570 --> 16:52.930
There's no life insurance,
no savings.

16:52.930 --> 16:55.450
If you don't find that gold,
I'll have to sell up.

16:55.450 --> 16:57.530
That place is all I've got
left of him.

16:57.530 --> 16:59.570
I know this must be very hard
for you...

16:59.570 --> 17:03.410
Grandad's dead and someone's taken
his treasure. You HAVE to find it.

17:18.890 --> 17:20.410
What does she expect you to do?

17:20.410 --> 17:22.530
We searched the cottage,
there's no coins there.

17:22.530 --> 17:25.050
Unless you count the 17p down
the back of the sofa.

17:25.050 --> 17:26.849
I feel I owe it to her
to keep looking.

17:26.849 --> 17:28.569
If we can find out
what happened to Errol,

17:28.569 --> 17:30.770
maybe we'll find the real coins.
If they even exist.

17:30.770 --> 17:33.570
SHE GASPS
Whoa-oa-oa!

17:33.570 --> 17:35.890
If you say, "pirate curse"
one more time,

17:35.890 --> 17:37.650
I'm going to shove you in that water.

17:37.650 --> 17:39.450
Right, hang on. Oh, thank you.

17:39.450 --> 17:41.730
Good luck, that. Really?

17:44.890 --> 17:46.130
You here about Errol?

17:48.650 --> 17:50.130
Debs called me.

17:51.450 --> 17:54.250
You were with him last night?
That's right.

17:54.250 --> 17:56.370
We walked him back,
then we went straight home.

17:56.370 --> 17:59.090
How do you know the others
went straight home?

17:59.090 --> 18:01.690
It was very late. I know I did.

18:01.690 --> 18:04.330
Could someone have swapped
the treasure before then?

18:04.330 --> 18:07.050
Swapped? Well, the coins we saw
were replicas.

18:07.050 --> 18:09.450
His granddaughter's convinced
they were swapped.

18:09.450 --> 18:12.610
Impossible. The four of us
were together the whole time.

18:12.610 --> 18:13.930
We barely took our eyes off it.

18:13.930 --> 18:16.370
Did Errol have any enemies?

18:16.370 --> 18:19.050
He could be prickly, but enemies?
No.

18:21.530 --> 18:24.290
Is there anything else? I need
to get on. No, that's fine. Thanks.

18:24.290 --> 18:26.970
Can your wife confirm
what time you got home?

18:26.970 --> 18:28.570
Doubt it.

18:28.570 --> 18:31.010
She was snoring like
an outboard motor when I got back.

18:31.010 --> 18:34.050
Maybe we should pop round,
double check. Yeah.

18:37.290 --> 18:38.730
Wait!

18:40.770 --> 18:42.970
I might have stopped off somewhere
on the way back.

18:42.970 --> 18:44.370
Where?

18:44.370 --> 18:45.930
A friend's flat.

18:47.130 --> 18:48.930
A friend, or more than a friend?

18:51.290 --> 18:55.210
If you prefer, we could have this
conversation in front of your wife?

18:56.210 --> 18:57.730
HE SIGHS
All right.

19:00.530 --> 19:01.930
I've been seeing someone.

19:01.930 --> 19:04.090
One of your fellow treasure hunters?

19:04.090 --> 19:08.010
That'd explain where Debs got those
expensive shoes from, then, eh?

19:09.410 --> 19:11.010
Except it's not Debs, is it?

19:14.170 --> 19:15.810
Who, then?

19:18.050 --> 19:20.410
He admitted it? You're surprised?

19:20.410 --> 19:23.490
I love Ray, but he's been
in the closet for so long

19:23.490 --> 19:25.770
that he has mothballs in his pocket.

19:25.770 --> 19:29.330
Were you together all night?
Until 4am.

19:29.330 --> 19:32.330
If he leaves it any later,
his wife's sleeping pills wear off.

19:32.330 --> 19:34.530
And did Errol know about you two?

19:34.530 --> 19:37.770
No, I doubt it.
He was only interested in himself.

19:37.770 --> 19:39.010
You didn't like him?

19:39.010 --> 19:41.370
Put it this way,
if it wasn't for Ray,

19:41.370 --> 19:43.970
I would have left LTH years ago.

19:43.970 --> 19:47.730
Errol was a bully
with a nasty temper. Ask anyone.

19:47.730 --> 19:51.330
Oi! I told Ray Mason,
I'm not having your lot in here.

19:51.330 --> 19:54.650
What did you say? Er...Mick...?
Go on, scarper! You're barred!

19:54.650 --> 19:56.490
You can't bar someone for being gay!

19:56.490 --> 19:58.410
Eh? The lad can sleep with men,

19:58.410 --> 20:00.450
women or inflatable sheep
for all I care!

20:00.450 --> 20:03.690
I don't want no treasure hunters
bringing their curse in my pub.

20:03.690 --> 20:06.250
And here was me thinking
you couldn't sound more ridiculous.

20:06.250 --> 20:09.530
Here, word's out that they found
Long Ben's gold.

20:09.530 --> 20:13.050
My punters are a superstitious lot.
It's bad for business.

20:13.050 --> 20:14.970
There's no such thing
as a pirate curse!

20:14.970 --> 20:17.050
Oi!
SMASH!

20:17.050 --> 20:20.250
Ha! Been meaning to look at
that fuse box, lads! Ha-ha!

20:21.770 --> 20:23.090
Right, I think we should go.

20:23.090 --> 20:25.090
Thanks. Go on.

20:25.090 --> 20:26.450
Go on!

20:28.370 --> 20:31.450
You need to find what happened before
that lot start phoning exorcists.

20:31.450 --> 20:33.730
Hang on, you're the one saying
someone murdered Errol

20:33.730 --> 20:35.370
and then vanished
from a locked room.

20:35.370 --> 20:38.330
Maybe I should bring
Long Ben in for questioning.

20:38.330 --> 20:41.970
Unless Errol was a dead man
before he got home.

20:41.970 --> 20:43.250
You've lost me. Get in.

20:43.250 --> 20:45.850
Where are we going? Mortuary.
Lucky me(!)

20:55.690 --> 20:57.610
I need to see you, now!

21:02.810 --> 21:05.970
OK. "Time of death..."
Blah-blah-blah.

21:05.970 --> 21:07.610
"Most likely cause of death,

21:07.610 --> 21:10.250
"respiratory paralysis
during a seizure.

21:10.250 --> 21:13.130
"The presence of bloodied diarrhoea
suggests

21:13.130 --> 21:14.770
"the ingestion of a toxin."

21:16.250 --> 21:17.610
There was poison?

21:17.610 --> 21:19.210
Yeah, I'll chase up the tox report.

21:19.210 --> 21:22.010
All right, well,
maybe he was murdered.

21:22.010 --> 21:25.450
Could've happened in the pub. Ray
said all eyes were on the treasure.

21:25.450 --> 21:28.690
Or someone could've gone back
to the house once they'd all gone,

21:28.690 --> 21:30.970
poisoned him and then left
before it took effect.

21:30.970 --> 21:33.210
Well, there was an empty
whisky glass by the body.

21:33.210 --> 21:35.610
I can get it tested. OK.

21:35.610 --> 21:37.570
Let me know what you find. I'm late.

21:37.570 --> 21:39.890
Late? What for? My date.

21:40.890 --> 21:42.650
What date?

21:46.770 --> 21:48.730
You can take that look
off your face.

21:54.090 --> 21:55.850
CREAKING

21:57.290 --> 21:59.010
Hello?

21:59.010 --> 22:01.170
CREAKING

22:01.170 --> 22:03.890
SMASH!
Oh, no, no, no, no!

22:03.890 --> 22:05.170
Oh, no!

22:08.930 --> 22:11.170
Ah, Deborah. Professor!

22:15.050 --> 22:16.850
What's wrong?

22:16.850 --> 22:18.970
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

22:18.970 --> 22:20.930
SHE SIGHS

22:22.050 --> 22:23.690
SHE SIGHS

22:28.210 --> 22:30.410
Well? What's wrong?

22:30.410 --> 22:31.930
I like it.

22:31.930 --> 22:33.970
No need to look quite so shocked.

22:33.970 --> 22:36.850
I just wanted to let you know
how proud I am of you.

22:36.850 --> 22:39.050
Right. Can I borrow you?

22:43.450 --> 22:45.170
OK. Red or blue? Red.

22:45.170 --> 22:46.930
Blue it is. It's your funeral.

22:46.930 --> 22:49.570
Wear the red,
it shows off your cleavage!

22:49.570 --> 22:51.930
Mum! He works in a museum!

22:51.930 --> 22:53.490
He's still a man!

22:54.770 --> 22:56.050
Hm!

23:05.170 --> 23:06.970
It's beautiful, isn't it?

23:06.970 --> 23:08.250
Yeah.

23:08.250 --> 23:10.530
It's not quite what I expected,
but...

23:10.530 --> 23:12.850
Oh, if you'd prefer...
No, no, no, it's fine.

23:15.650 --> 23:17.170
Poor girl.

23:17.170 --> 23:18.730
She's already lost her parents.

23:20.450 --> 23:22.410
How did she take the news
about the coins?

23:22.410 --> 23:26.250
Well, she's convinced
someone bumped Errol off,

23:26.250 --> 23:29.410
took the real treasures
and put the fakes in their place.

23:29.410 --> 23:31.170
Why would she think that?

23:31.170 --> 23:34.610
She said her grandfather was obsessed
with coins, would know a fake.

23:34.610 --> 23:37.130
And I think she's protecting
the memory of her grandfather.

23:37.130 --> 23:38.890
HE SCOFFS

23:38.890 --> 23:40.690
What's that supposed to mean?

23:40.690 --> 23:43.130
I can't say I took to him,
personally.

23:43.130 --> 23:45.930
You knew Errol?
Oh, no, no. I met him once.

23:45.930 --> 23:49.330
I helped him find some old maps
in the archives a few weeks ago.

23:52.490 --> 23:54.410
You've, um...

23:54.410 --> 23:56.050
You've got a bit of...

23:56.050 --> 23:57.970
Ah!
HE CHUCKLES

23:57.970 --> 23:59.450
Here, let me.

24:01.890 --> 24:03.330
Thank you.

24:03.330 --> 24:05.250
SHE CHUCKLES

24:05.250 --> 24:07.410
I take it there's not a Mr Coroner?

24:08.450 --> 24:10.170
You don't hang about, do you?

24:11.490 --> 24:13.170
It's a professional habit.

24:13.170 --> 24:15.690
Rare treasures don't come along
very often.

24:15.690 --> 24:18.090
You have to make the most of it
when they do.

24:28.010 --> 24:29.690
SHE SOBS

24:42.010 --> 24:44.050
The university wanted me
to run the department,

24:44.050 --> 24:46.530
but I'd had enough of city life.

24:46.530 --> 24:48.690
I wanted to be somewhere
I could breathe.

24:48.690 --> 24:50.530
So, do you think you'll stay here?

24:50.530 --> 24:53.850
Well, it depends what happens
with the museum.

24:53.850 --> 24:56.090
With budget cuts as they are...
Whoa!

24:56.090 --> 24:58.450
..you never know
what's around the bend.

24:59.850 --> 25:02.250
Maybe there's something to be said
for pirate curses.

25:02.250 --> 25:04.530
Perhaps it's like fairy tales.

25:04.530 --> 25:06.890
The princess is cursed until...

25:06.890 --> 25:08.810
A handsome stranger comes along.

25:11.410 --> 25:13.050
PHONE RINGS

25:13.050 --> 25:14.890
Hold that thought.

25:15.930 --> 25:17.690
Davey. What is it?

25:18.690 --> 25:20.090
What, now?

25:22.530 --> 25:26.130
SHE SIGHS
No, fine. I'm on my way back. Bye.

25:26.130 --> 25:28.530
I'm sorry, I have to go. Already?

25:28.530 --> 25:31.250
Someone's got some information
about the pirate treasure.

25:31.250 --> 25:32.410
Really?

25:32.410 --> 25:34.170
Sorry.

25:38.810 --> 25:40.890
Right, so, what's this new piece
of information?

25:40.890 --> 25:43.290
I need protection.
From who? From him!

25:43.290 --> 25:45.090
(Long Ben!)

25:45.090 --> 25:47.890
Look, I only kept one.

25:47.890 --> 25:49.650
There's another one!

25:53.970 --> 25:56.930
But he's coming for me now.
He sent me a message.

25:56.930 --> 25:59.770
A ship in a bottle.
And I've just lost my job!

25:59.770 --> 26:01.170
You were fired from the museum?

26:01.170 --> 26:03.170
I can barely make the rent
on my flat as it is.

26:03.170 --> 26:05.330
I've got credit-card debts
coming out of my ears

26:05.330 --> 26:06.810
and I've got this pain just here.

26:06.810 --> 26:08.410
It's the curse, I know it is!

26:08.410 --> 26:11.090
Look, just take it.
I don't want it any more.

26:11.090 --> 26:12.810
Miss Luscombe, you're perfectly safe.

26:12.810 --> 26:14.850
As far as we can tell,
the treasure isn't real.

26:14.850 --> 26:16.250
So, you can't be cursed, can you?

26:16.250 --> 26:18.970
Yeah. Can you just keep me
in overnight, just in case?

26:18.970 --> 26:21.250
Will you excuse us just a moment?
A word?

26:24.650 --> 26:25.930
You brought me back for this?

26:25.930 --> 26:28.170
I thought it might be important.

26:28.170 --> 26:30.090
Sarge? Nice one. Thanks, Jim.

26:33.050 --> 26:34.530
I know that face.

26:34.530 --> 26:35.810
This is all your fault.

26:35.810 --> 26:38.210
Only because you let him
walk all over you.

26:38.210 --> 26:40.170
VEHICLE APPROACHES

26:48.890 --> 26:50.850
The lady in the cottage
down the hill from Errol

26:50.850 --> 26:53.010
said she heard a van
late last night.

26:53.010 --> 26:55.290
Looked suspicious,
so she wrote down the reg.

26:56.290 --> 26:58.090
What were you doing there, Ray?

26:59.290 --> 27:01.210
Or maybe I should arrest you both.

27:03.530 --> 27:04.890
It's my fault.

27:06.450 --> 27:07.890
I'd had a few drinks.

27:09.450 --> 27:12.210
I got paranoid that Errol was
trying to keep the reward.

27:12.210 --> 27:16.610
So... So you persuaded Ray to go
back and demand your share?

27:17.610 --> 27:19.330
I'm guessing it didn't go well.

27:19.330 --> 27:20.890
I knocked, but there was no answer.

27:20.890 --> 27:23.330
So I went round the back
and he started firing at me.

27:24.370 --> 27:25.850
So I hid in the shed.

27:25.850 --> 27:27.450
I heard sirens and I scarpered.

27:28.690 --> 27:30.810
Did you see anyone else?

27:30.810 --> 27:32.930
No. So, why did you lie?

27:34.410 --> 27:36.610
I went back this morning
to make peace with him.

27:38.010 --> 27:39.930
Then I saw your lot and I panicked.

27:41.210 --> 27:43.730
I didn't want to get in any trouble.

27:43.730 --> 27:45.450
All right.

27:45.450 --> 27:47.930
I think we'll finish this
down the station.

27:57.690 --> 27:59.410
What d'you reckon?

27:59.410 --> 28:01.330
It just doesn't sit right.

28:03.250 --> 28:05.450
Well, we can place him at the scene

28:05.450 --> 28:07.890
and he's got motive enough
with the coins.

28:07.890 --> 28:09.410
Yeah, I know, but...

28:10.690 --> 28:13.530
Maybe if there'd been an argument,
a struggle.

28:14.690 --> 28:16.890
Ray lost his temper in the heat
of the moment,

28:16.890 --> 28:19.650
whacked Errol over the head,
that...that would make sense,

28:19.650 --> 28:21.610
but to poison him? It's...

28:22.650 --> 28:24.930
..it's premeditated.
I just don't buy it.

28:24.930 --> 28:27.370
You know, for once,
I think you might have a point.

28:29.410 --> 28:31.690
Any sign of the coins? No.

28:31.690 --> 28:35.250
The lads are searching his house,
but there's nothing there so far.

28:35.250 --> 28:38.770
I hate to say it, but...I believe
him.

28:38.770 --> 28:40.530
Well, we'll keep him here
for a while,

28:40.530 --> 28:43.050
see if we can prise anything useful
out of him.

28:43.050 --> 28:45.970
Good luck with that.
You got any better ideas?

28:50.370 --> 28:52.570
Right. No local shops
selling replicas,

28:52.570 --> 28:55.210
but a few online places
stock the same ones.

28:55.210 --> 28:56.690
Start calling around.

28:56.690 --> 28:58.570
See if there are any orders
to this area.

28:58.570 --> 29:03.170
If we can find out who buried these,
I can prove to Amelia
there never was any real treasure.

29:06.530 --> 29:08.290
Wait a minute.

29:08.290 --> 29:10.410
Where'd you get that one from?

29:10.410 --> 29:12.410
Deborah Luscombe.

29:14.330 --> 29:16.730
Where you going?
The treasure hunt is back on.

29:23.930 --> 29:25.810
I was just thinking about you.

29:25.810 --> 29:27.930
Where? One of the treasure hunters
pocketed it

29:27.930 --> 29:29.370
when they were digging them up.

29:29.370 --> 29:32.530
OK. I-I'm supposed to be going to
a meeting, just give me one minute.

29:32.530 --> 29:34.210
I'll tell them something's come up.
OK.

29:59.130 --> 30:01.730
TAL CLEARS THROAT

30:04.770 --> 30:07.690
Where were we? I've just had a call.
Urgent. I'll ring you later.

30:07.690 --> 30:09.850
But...but I should...take a look.

30:17.010 --> 30:18.650
You were right.

30:18.650 --> 30:21.050
The only phone call from Errol's
mobile phone was to you,

30:21.050 --> 30:24.250
but the signal in the pub comes
and goes, so I checked the payphone.

30:24.250 --> 30:27.730
Someone phoned the professor
at 10:00 last night.

30:27.730 --> 30:29.010
God, it was him, wasn't it?

30:29.010 --> 30:31.970
Mm. So, do you think your
boyfriend...? He's not my boyfriend!

30:31.970 --> 30:33.810
..could have found out
about the treasure,

30:33.810 --> 30:36.170
gone round to Errol's,
swapped the coins, poisoned him

30:36.170 --> 30:38.170
and then disappeared
while he was still alive?

30:38.170 --> 30:39.810
No. But you...

30:39.810 --> 30:42.890
He didn't swap them that night. He
needed time to sort out the replicas.

30:42.890 --> 30:45.010
And, of course, he knew
I would bring them to him

30:45.010 --> 30:47.050
because he's the curator.
I'm such an idiot!

30:47.050 --> 30:50.210
Well, be that as it may,
we still don't have enough evidence.

30:50.210 --> 30:53.690
Not enough to get a search warrant.
And toxicology's drawn a blank.

30:53.690 --> 30:56.370
Without the coins, we can't prove
your professor was involved.

30:56.370 --> 30:57.850
Shouldn't we at least talk to him?

30:57.850 --> 31:00.370
You want to take down
his particulars(?) Shut up!

31:00.370 --> 31:03.850
No, I think we should find out
who made the phone call first. How?

31:03.850 --> 31:05.290
By going to the pub.

31:08.170 --> 31:10.010
Nice one. Thanks, Moz.

31:10.010 --> 31:13.250
He reckons Errol was the only person
to use the payphone last night.

31:13.250 --> 31:14.610
Was Moz here all night?

31:14.610 --> 31:16.810
Moz is always here.
Mick wants to charge him rent.

31:16.810 --> 31:18.610
Here we go!

31:18.610 --> 31:20.770
Thank you, my lover.

31:20.770 --> 31:22.850
I didn't know we were staying.

31:22.850 --> 31:24.250
Oh, give him a break.

31:24.250 --> 31:27.170
Yeah, come on.
I've been on duty since 7:00.

31:27.170 --> 31:29.850
Anyway, we can celebrate
Beth's wonderful achievement.

31:29.850 --> 31:31.330
Cheers!

31:31.330 --> 31:33.370
Could I please have a quick word?

31:38.730 --> 31:41.570
You've got to get that bracelet
off Beth. Why?

31:41.570 --> 31:43.770
I bought them cheap
from a mate of mine,

31:43.770 --> 31:45.970
sold them on to the local shops.

31:45.970 --> 31:48.770
But he rang me a couple of days
ago... What have you done?

31:48.770 --> 31:51.610
Turns out they're made from
jequirity beans.

31:51.610 --> 31:53.530
They're from Peru,
or someplace like that.

31:53.530 --> 31:56.850
Thing is, they're poisonous.
They contain Abrin.

31:56.850 --> 31:59.730
Abrin?! Ssh!
I've tried to buy them all back,

31:59.730 --> 32:02.010
but one or two of them
may have already been sold.

32:02.010 --> 32:03.650
Like the one on my daughter's wrist.

32:03.650 --> 32:05.930
They're only toxic
if you break open the shell,

32:05.930 --> 32:08.250
so she shouldn't be
in any immediate danger.

32:08.250 --> 32:10.170
And how am I going to get it off her?

32:10.170 --> 32:14.050
If I tell her it's made from
a highly poisonous bean,
she's going to like it even more.

32:19.530 --> 32:22.770
I think I know what Tal used
to poison Errol and how we find
the coins.

32:22.770 --> 32:25.370
You going so soon? Yeah. Sorry.

32:27.330 --> 32:30.010
Glad you like your bracelet.
Apparently, they're all the rage.

32:30.010 --> 32:32.090
I saw a picture of Justin Bieber
wearing one.

32:32.090 --> 32:33.690
Oh, I like Justin Bieber.

32:33.690 --> 32:35.730
What's wrong? Nothing.

32:35.730 --> 32:38.210
I thought you liked it? No, I-I do.

32:38.210 --> 32:40.890
Because if you don't,
you could swap it for something else.

32:40.890 --> 32:43.650
Or I could give you the money
and you could choose something?

32:43.650 --> 32:45.890
Mick, you got that money you owe me?

32:45.890 --> 32:47.450
Eh?

32:56.370 --> 32:58.850
Sure you don't mind?
No, of course not.

32:58.850 --> 33:00.490
Thanks!

33:01.570 --> 33:03.250
Result! Hm!

33:55.010 --> 33:56.850
PHONE RINGS

34:01.050 --> 34:03.010
I was wondering when you'd call.

34:03.010 --> 34:05.450
Sorry I had to run off earlier,
but I've got good news.

34:05.450 --> 34:08.170
Oh, yeah? The police know
where the real treasure is.

34:08.170 --> 34:10.210
They haven't given me
the details yet,

34:10.210 --> 34:13.449
but they're on their way to arrest
the man responsible. Oh, g...great!

34:13.449 --> 34:15.570
So you'll get to examine
a real hoard after all.

34:17.929 --> 34:19.730
Drink later to celebrate?

34:19.730 --> 34:23.010
Yeah, yeah, of course.
Um...can I call you back?

34:23.010 --> 34:26.010
I'm just in the middle of something.
Yes, of course.

34:26.010 --> 34:27.770
Er...bye, then. Yeah, bye.

34:35.370 --> 34:37.730
You really think
he's going to fall for that?

34:37.730 --> 34:40.810
He was arrogant enough to believe
I'd been blinded by his charms.

34:46.810 --> 34:48.889
He's got a point, though, hasn't he?

34:48.889 --> 34:51.290
What can I say?
I've got terrible taste in men.

34:52.770 --> 34:54.210
See?

34:54.210 --> 34:56.449
Excuse me!
Let me just stop you there, sir.

34:56.449 --> 34:57.850
Can I just have a look in that bag?

34:59.530 --> 35:00.730
Hey!

35:24.170 --> 35:25.530
Oh!

35:26.770 --> 35:28.530
TAL GROANS

35:28.530 --> 35:30.810
What happened? Pirate curse.

35:34.850 --> 35:38.610
I imagine collectors would pay a
fortune for genuine pirate treasure.

35:38.610 --> 35:40.730
They want to close us down.

35:40.730 --> 35:42.330
I've already had to lay people off.

35:42.330 --> 35:44.290
Those coins were our last hope.

35:44.290 --> 35:46.370
You know what I think?
Fortnight from now,

35:46.370 --> 35:49.370
you'd be off somewhere on a private
yacht, congratulating yourself.

35:49.370 --> 35:50.970
It was greed, pure and simple.

35:50.970 --> 35:53.570
Suppose a second date's
out of the question?

35:53.570 --> 35:55.170
OK. Mind your head.

35:59.690 --> 36:02.530
Why does it matter, anyway? It's not
like they belonged to anyone.

36:02.530 --> 36:04.810
They'd been under the ground
for hundreds of years.

36:04.810 --> 36:06.770
Well, we both know
that's not how it works.

36:06.770 --> 36:09.930
But be that as it may, I'm not
really interested in the coins.

36:09.930 --> 36:12.330
You're not? No.

36:13.330 --> 36:16.090
So...? Why did you give the poison
to Errol?

36:16.090 --> 36:19.050
Poison?
Come on, don't play games with me.

36:19.050 --> 36:22.010
I don't know what you're talking
about! I'm trying to help you,

36:22.010 --> 36:23.810
but if you don't want
to cooperate...

36:23.810 --> 36:25.810
Abrin.
Controlled under the Terrorism Act.

36:25.810 --> 36:27.970
You want to be done for terrorism
as well as murder?

36:27.970 --> 36:30.010
I said that I swapped
the coins around.

36:30.010 --> 36:32.690
I'll sign a statement, whatever,
but I didn't murder anyone!

36:32.690 --> 36:34.210
I don't believe you.

36:34.210 --> 36:37.450
Look, I met up with Errol once
a few weeks ago.

36:37.450 --> 36:40.730
So? You had motive and access
to the poison.

36:42.490 --> 36:44.410
What's this? That's a bracelet.

36:44.410 --> 36:45.810
Those are jequirity beans.

36:45.810 --> 36:48.450
Contain Abrin.
Sold at your place of work.

36:50.330 --> 36:52.250
Convenient, that, isn't it?

36:53.690 --> 36:55.290
Lots of people work there.

37:05.370 --> 37:07.930
We're closed. We're not buying.

37:09.530 --> 37:11.810
It's not my fault! I had no idea
they were poisonous

37:11.810 --> 37:14.010
until Mick phoned
and he took them all back!

37:14.010 --> 37:16.210
All of them, even yours? Mine?

37:16.210 --> 37:19.130
Professor Greening showed us how
to access the staff discount log.

37:19.130 --> 37:21.650
You bought one for yourself.
So, how did you do it?

37:21.650 --> 37:23.410
Grind them up into his drink?

37:23.410 --> 37:25.490
Like you said, fewer the members,
bigger the cut.

37:25.490 --> 37:27.690
Pay off your debts.
You do it on your own,

37:27.690 --> 37:30.930
or were you working with Professor
Greening? I-I didn't do anything!

37:30.930 --> 37:32.490
Show us the bracelet.

37:32.490 --> 37:34.490
I haven't got it any more.

37:34.490 --> 37:36.250
I-I gave it to Errol!

37:36.250 --> 37:39.250
You admit it, then?
No. As a present!

37:39.250 --> 37:42.530
You expect us to believe you bought
a bracelet for an ex-fisherman?

37:42.530 --> 37:44.210
As a present for someone else.

37:44.210 --> 37:47.610
He gave me the money.
He wanted to use my staff discount.

37:47.610 --> 37:49.450
So, who did he give it to?

37:49.450 --> 37:50.890
I don't know.

37:52.650 --> 37:54.170
I think I do. Yeah.

37:58.210 --> 37:59.930
So, you've found the treasure?

37:59.930 --> 38:02.050
Yes. It'll be valued in due course.

38:02.050 --> 38:05.130
Oh. My grandfather would've been
very happy to hear it.

38:05.130 --> 38:07.370
We've just got a few things
to clear up.

38:07.370 --> 38:10.130
You still have the bracelet
he gave you? Sorry?

38:10.130 --> 38:12.170
You see, they pose
a public health risk

38:12.170 --> 38:13.770
and we're trying to track them down.

38:13.770 --> 38:15.290
I've never had a bracelet. Really?

38:15.290 --> 38:18.090
We have a witness who says you were
given one for your birthday.

38:18.090 --> 38:20.010
They must be mistaken.

38:24.170 --> 38:26.410
Want to explain how this
got in your bins?

38:26.410 --> 38:30.410
Oh, that? With what's gone on...
I threw it away.

38:31.530 --> 38:33.330
A gift from your late grandfather?

38:33.330 --> 38:35.890
It broke. It broke, or you broke it?

38:35.890 --> 38:38.610
I can't remember. You used it
to poison him, didn't you?

38:38.610 --> 38:39.970
That's ridiculous!

38:39.970 --> 38:43.570
I would never hurt him.
He was a kind, loving, gentle man.

38:43.570 --> 38:45.570
I don't think
he was any of those things.

38:45.570 --> 38:48.450
How dare you?! Even his best friend
said he was prickly.

38:51.170 --> 38:53.250
Errol was driving that night,
wasn't he?

38:53.250 --> 38:55.090
The night your parents were killed.

38:55.090 --> 38:58.010
You see, we took a leaf
out of your grandfather's book.

38:58.010 --> 39:02.010
You do enough digging and eventually
you find what you're looking for.

39:02.010 --> 39:05.410
Now, it says here that the car
ran off the road and hit a tree.

39:05.410 --> 39:08.170
Is that right?
You blamed him for their deaths.

39:08.170 --> 39:11.490
Which is a little bit unfair
because according to this,

39:11.490 --> 39:13.890
a deer ran out into the road
and he swerved to miss it.

39:13.890 --> 39:16.050
He'd been drinking.
Why wasn't he charged?

39:16.050 --> 39:18.890
Because he got out of the car
and ran away.

39:18.890 --> 39:21.210
He said he was going to get help.

39:21.210 --> 39:22.650
He didn't come back.

39:22.650 --> 39:24.610
He left me in the car with...

39:24.610 --> 39:26.850
with Mum and Dad.

39:26.850 --> 39:28.690
What was left of them.

39:28.690 --> 39:30.610
I was just a kid.

39:30.610 --> 39:32.610
He said he was in shock.
He got lost.

39:32.610 --> 39:35.290
He knew those roads
like the back of his hand.

39:35.290 --> 39:38.890
He was waiting until he was sober
enough to pass a breath test.

39:38.890 --> 39:41.970
So you were forced to live with
the man who killed your parents.

39:41.970 --> 39:44.130
Cleaning up his mess,
cooking for him.

39:44.130 --> 39:45.690
No wonder you decided to poison him.

39:45.690 --> 39:48.330
I wasn't even here!
Abrin takes a while to kick in.

39:48.330 --> 39:51.930
You made him breakfast yesterday
morning before you left, didn't you?

39:51.930 --> 39:54.650
You had method, motive
and opportunity.

39:54.650 --> 39:57.530
You had to wait until you were 18,
then you'd get your inheritance.

39:57.530 --> 39:59.090
Except there isn't any, is there?

39:59.090 --> 40:01.730
Because you told me
he'd spent the lot. We checked.

40:05.210 --> 40:06.530
He blew it all.

40:06.530 --> 40:10.810
On whisky and gadgets
for his stupid treasure hunting.

40:10.810 --> 40:13.450
All I got was that poxy bracelet.

40:13.450 --> 40:15.250
I was going to sell it online.

40:16.810 --> 40:18.850
Then when I found out
that the beads were...

40:23.170 --> 40:24.810
It seemed perfect.

40:26.850 --> 40:28.050
Poetic.

40:32.370 --> 40:34.210
You're under arrest.

40:40.210 --> 40:41.930
I can't help but feel sorry for her.

40:41.930 --> 40:43.610
She didn't have to kill him.
No, I know.

40:43.610 --> 40:46.730
And if she hadn't, she would have
inherited a small fortune.

40:46.730 --> 40:49.570
I still don't get why Errol told
the 999 operator it was Long Ben.

40:49.570 --> 40:51.530
Well, he thought it was.

40:51.530 --> 40:55.130
Abrin poisoning can cause
pretty trippy hallucinations.

40:55.130 --> 40:57.130
BANGING

40:57.130 --> 40:58.770
Go away!

41:00.170 --> 41:01.690
THUNDERCLAP

41:11.210 --> 41:14.410
Police! Let me in!

41:14.410 --> 41:16.410
He's outside. He's coming for me!

41:16.410 --> 41:18.930
Where's the gold, Errol?

41:18.930 --> 41:21.810
It's him. The Captain!

41:24.090 --> 41:26.170
LEAVE ME ALONE!

41:29.050 --> 41:30.970
Usual? Yeah.

41:32.530 --> 41:33.930
Gosh, it's busy in here.

41:33.930 --> 41:36.570
We've been heaving all night.
Word must have got out.

41:36.570 --> 41:39.610
Thinking of renaming the place
The Pirate's Gold.

41:39.610 --> 41:42.330
Get us a pint and a half
while you're there, Clint. Cheers.

41:42.330 --> 41:44.370
What is that?

41:44.370 --> 41:46.650
What's that doing in there?

41:46.650 --> 41:50.370
That should be in the package
for the British Museum. Sorry.

41:50.370 --> 41:53.090
You're a deeply evil person,
you know that?

41:53.090 --> 41:56.050
If you tell him that was a replica,
I'll kick you in the doubloons.

41:59.050 --> 42:01.250
MICK CHUCKLES

42:14.090 --> 42:16.570
So they're official. Looks like it.

42:16.570 --> 42:19.130
Let's go and make some
treasure hunters very happy.

42:23.610 --> 42:26.610
I still can't believe
a few coins are worth that much.

42:26.610 --> 42:29.090
That's the legend of Long Ben.

42:29.090 --> 42:32.490
Most pirates got caught eventually,
but Henry Avery, he got away with it.

42:32.490 --> 42:34.370
Disappeared without a trace.

42:34.370 --> 42:35.850
Sailed off into the sunset.

42:35.850 --> 42:38.490
Sounds kind of romantic
when you say it like that.

42:38.490 --> 42:40.570
Except when you strip back the myths
and glamour

42:40.570 --> 42:42.450
and realise he was
a cold-blooded killer.

42:42.450 --> 42:44.570
Do you think it really was his gold?

42:44.570 --> 42:47.050
Well, it certainly didn't bring
the professor much luck.

42:47.050 --> 42:49.890
And the judge didn't buy his
"saviour of the museum" act.

42:49.890 --> 42:51.650
Oi! So go on, then, how much?

42:51.650 --> 42:53.210
Nuh-huh, no spoilers. Huh!

42:53.210 --> 42:54.970
Thanks.

42:57.410 --> 42:59.130
Maybe Beth was right.

42:59.130 --> 43:01.450
Only thing cursed around here
is my love life.

43:21.650 --> 43:23.810
All rise for Her Majesty's Coroner.
