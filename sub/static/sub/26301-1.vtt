I got a part in
the "Little Shop of Horrors."

18:29.750 --> 18:31.210
Well, that's great, honey.
Which one?

18:31.210 --> 18:33.670
I'm Bud Number Three
on the man-eating plant.

18:33.670 --> 18:36.580
The drama teacher liked
Taylor's performance,

18:36.580 --> 18:38.380
but since she confidently
murders all lyrics,

18:38.380 --> 18:40.170
she gave her a part with
the least responsibility.

18:40.170 --> 18:41.380
That's right!

18:41.380 --> 18:43.290
Oh, and I'm meeting the cast
after dinner.

18:43.290 --> 18:44.500
It's really funny.

18:44.500 --> 18:46.210
They have no idea
they're losers.

18:46.210 --> 18:47.580
Just because
they're in the Drama Club

18:47.580 --> 18:48.750
doesn't mean
they're losers.

18:48.750 --> 18:50.170
That's what
they keep saying!

18:50.170 --> 18:52.210
Well,
will you look at that.

18:52.210 --> 18:54.750
Yes! Taylor made
some new friends.

18:54.750 --> 18:57.880
So "Pay up, sucker."
Johnny Diamond.

18:57.880 --> 19:02.880
"I was never gonna pay you $500,
dum-dum." Katie Otto.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.920
But a deal's a deal.

19:04.920 --> 19:06.790
Johnny's seminars
have tiered pricing.

19:06.790 --> 19:08.330
$500 is the Diamond Tier.

19:08.330 --> 19:10.080
That gets you a seat
in the front row.

19:10.080 --> 19:12.210
But $50 gets you
in the Turquoise Tier.

19:12.210 --> 19:14.040
Turquoise? Seriously?

19:14.040 --> 19:15.880
Do I look like
I'm selling trinkets

19:15.880 --> 19:17.420
on a blanket in Santa Fe?

19:17.420 --> 19:20.250
You get to watch a live feed
of the seminar from the lobby.

19:20.250 --> 19:21.380
Take it or leave it.

19:21.380 --> 19:23.790
[ Sighs ]

19:23.790 --> 19:26.210
Fine.

19:26.210 --> 19:28.960
But when the time comes,
just know I'm only paying

19:28.960 --> 19:30.960
for a Turquoise Tier
retirement home.

19:30.960 --> 19:33.710
[ Cellphone ringing ]

19:33.710 --> 19:34.880
This is it.

19:34.880 --> 19:36.670
This is my boss.

19:36.670 --> 19:38.120
I'm getting fired.

19:38.120 --> 19:40.170
Hey, Whitney.

19:40.170 --> 19:43.000
Whitney: I just had a very long
talk with Nancy Granville.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.460
Thought you might.

19:44.460 --> 19:46.210
She hated
the party you threw,

19:46.210 --> 19:48.670
but some of the other parents
were so impressed

19:48.670 --> 19:51.080
with your slime theme
that they hired us.

19:51.080 --> 19:52.540
We got four more parties.

19:52.540 --> 19:53.960
Does this mean
I'm not fired?

19:53.960 --> 19:55.880
You're not fired.

19:55.880 --> 19:59.290
And, in fact, you'll probably
end up working even more.

19:59.290 --> 20:01.880
What's the matter, Katie?
You look conflicted.

20:02.960 --> 20:05.000
I'm just kidding.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Lovely top, by the way.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.210
Kidding!

20:08.210 --> 20:09.380
Am I?

20:10.880 --> 20:12.420
So? How'd it go?

20:12.420 --> 20:14.170
Still have my job.

20:14.170 --> 20:15.330
That's great, honey.

20:15.330 --> 20:16.420
Is it?

20:16.420 --> 20:17.710
I don't know.

20:17.710 --> 20:19.170
What? I thought
you liked working.

20:19.170 --> 20:21.120
I do.
I love it.

20:21.120 --> 20:22.420
But I just feel guilty

20:22.420 --> 20:24.500
for spending time
away from you guys.

20:24.500 --> 20:26.710
And I don't like
missing your bedtime.

20:26.710 --> 20:28.620
I feel like me taking this job

20:28.620 --> 20:32.120
has really disrupted your
routine and it stresses you out.

20:32.120 --> 20:34.380
Mama, keep the job.

20:34.380 --> 20:36.460
Daddy's doing great.

20:36.460 --> 20:37.500
Let's face it.

20:37.500 --> 20:39.540
It's always gonna be
something with me.

20:39.540 --> 20:41.120
She's gonna live
with you forever.

20:41.120 --> 20:42.880
Yeah, me too,
probably.

20:42.880 --> 20:44.330
[ Laughs nervously ]

20:48.120 --> 20:49.750
"Once upon a time...

20:49.750 --> 20:54.080
there were three sisters named
Kim, Kourtney, and Khloé."

20:54.080 --> 20:55.670
That's what
you guys read
together?

20:55.670 --> 20:57.580
Of course. Why?

20:57.580 --> 20:58.920
What do you read to her
when I'm working late?

20:58.920 --> 20:59.960
Books!

20:59.960 --> 21:01.210
Pass!

21:01.210 --> 21:02.880
I'll stick to the classics.

21:02.880 --> 21:05.290
What happened
to the sisters, Mama?

21:05.290 --> 21:08.880
Well, each sister met
the man of their dreams

21:08.880 --> 21:12.460
and slowly destroyed them
bit by bit.

21:12.460 --> 21:15.580
Dad, can you check under my bed
for Kardashians?

21:15.580 --> 21:18.000
Mama's got you, baby.
