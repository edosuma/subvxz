WEBVTT

00:04.640 --> 00:06.483
Previously on "Power"...

00:06.640 --> 00:08.688
Man, you're protected
sent you out to steal

00:08.840 --> 00:10.490
from the wrong
motherfuckers tonight.

00:10.640 --> 00:13.041
When we met,
what you think I was gonna be?

00:13.240 --> 00:15.402
The biggest goddamn
drug dealer in New York City.

00:15.560 --> 00:16.561
The boss is here.

00:16.720 --> 00:18.404
- To Truth.
- Truth!

00:18.560 --> 00:20.688
That was the dream.
We can get out.

00:20.840 --> 00:24.526
- We can have it all.
- We already have it all.

00:24.680 --> 00:26.489
You recognize the name Simon Stern?

00:26.640 --> 00:28.415
He's one of the biggest
nightlife investors in New York.

00:28.440 --> 00:29.885
Truth is not for sale, Simon.

00:30.040 --> 00:31.246
If I walk out of that door,

00:31.400 --> 00:33.368
I turn from potential ally
back to competitor.

00:33.520 --> 00:34.885
May the best man win.

00:35.040 --> 00:37.122
Angela Valdes
came into the club last night.

00:37.280 --> 00:38.441
From high school?

00:38.640 --> 00:40.000
I never stopped
thinking about you.

00:40.025 --> 00:43.049
- All these years.
- I have a boyfriend, Greg.

00:43.200 --> 00:44.565
You haven't wanted to hang out.

00:44.720 --> 00:46.643
You've been distracted.
Is there someone else?

00:46.800 --> 00:48.643
I got a new job,
driving Uncle G.

00:48.800 --> 00:50.529
I know you gonna
do me proud, son.

00:50.680 --> 00:53.001
You probably see a lot
driving him around, Shawn?

00:53.160 --> 00:56.209
You can tell me. It'll be another one
of our little secrets.

00:56.360 --> 00:58.522
Seems like my husband
is seeing another woman.

00:58.680 --> 01:00.842
Shawn told me
her name is Angela.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.844
Angela was trouble before.
Just don't wanna see you get fucked up.

01:04.040 --> 01:05.963
I want to change my life
for you.

01:06.120 --> 01:08.202
- Come with me to Miami.
- I would love to.

01:08.360 --> 01:11.160
Ever since you've opened that club,
it's like I don't know who you are.

01:11.185 --> 01:12.451
Been trying to tell you, Tasha.

01:12.600 --> 01:14.280
When I get back from Miami,
we should talk.

01:14.305 --> 01:17.607
You ain't got no legal claim
on his illegal money.

01:17.695 --> 01:19.415
I need a checking account
with a debit card.

01:19.440 --> 01:20.726
Got some fine-ass looking girls

01:20.880 --> 01:22.325
serving drinks in here,
by the way.

01:22.480 --> 01:24.130
Holly's different.
She's special.

01:24.280 --> 01:26.044
I am a fucked-up thief

01:26.200 --> 01:28.202
and you are a crazy drug dealer.

01:28.360 --> 01:30.044
You and I were made
for each other.

01:30.200 --> 01:31.884
Our goal is the prosecution

01:32.040 --> 01:34.327
of one of the most notorious
drug traffickers

01:34.480 --> 01:36.323
in our hemisphere, Felipe Lobos.

01:36.480 --> 01:38.642
When I hired you to be
my New York distributor,

01:38.800 --> 01:41.485
you guaranteed me
a certain level of professionalism.

01:41.640 --> 01:43.563
Someone's been hitting our crew,

01:43.720 --> 01:45.245
dropping motherfuckers
left and right.

01:45.400 --> 01:47.084
Ruiz said a girl stabbed him.

01:47.240 --> 01:49.083
Beautiful ass.
Latin girl. Strong.

01:49.240 --> 01:52.084
I know who's been going after us.
It's Rolla.

01:52.240 --> 01:54.891
I'm not pulling that trigger
without proof, Tommy.

01:55.040 --> 01:56.849
Get all the fucking proof
you need if you can.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.890
He was right about Rolla. Said he wanted
to take down your whole network.

02:00.040 --> 02:02.805
It's Kanan, right? Shit, you trust him
more than anybody.

02:02.960 --> 02:06.089
- He's my friend.
- I'm your friend.

02:08.320 --> 02:11.164
From now on, I need you to distribute
double the amount of product.

02:11.320 --> 02:12.920
I think you should
take the lead on this.

02:12.945 --> 02:14.225
Be the authority on the streets.

02:14.345 --> 02:17.323
We need to get you close to Ruiz
so you can identify this distributor.

02:17.480 --> 02:18.561
That's live.

02:18.720 --> 02:20.000
We'll be able
to hear everything.

02:20.040 --> 02:22.771
I'm expecting Ghost,
the pendejo who supplies us.

02:22.920 --> 02:25.366
Bruja, I saw the distributor.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.045
He saw Ghost's face.

02:27.200 --> 02:28.804
What the fuck
you staring at, man?

02:29.000 --> 02:30.684
I need to get Nomar into WITSEC.

02:30.840 --> 02:32.922
One of my soldiers,
name is Nomar.

02:33.080 --> 02:35.321
- Been fucking my little girl.
- Where can I find him?

02:36.800 --> 02:37.801
Nomar, stay with me.

02:37.960 --> 02:41.328
This is AUSA Angela Valdes.
My Cl's been stabbed.

02:41.480 --> 02:43.482
- You owe me money.
- And you owe me bodies.

02:43.680 --> 02:45.880
And, honey, you're gonna need
to get you some new shoes.

02:45.905 --> 02:48.211

You were on a date.

06:08.160 --> 06:10.686
This better be good.

06:10.840 --> 06:14.242
When Nomar was dying,
he told me who stabbed him.

06:14.400 --> 06:15.765
It was Ghost.

06:15.920 --> 06:17.843
The distributor
did Nomar personally?

06:18.000 --> 06:19.923
That's what he said.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.845
And it turns out that Nomar
had already spoken to a sketch artist.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.002
I've got a partial.

06:25.160 --> 06:27.640
Not enough
for facial recognition.

06:27.800 --> 06:30.531
And you're not gonna ID him
with your naked eye in that book.

06:30.680 --> 06:34.480
Frankie, I lost a Cl tonight.
I've got to try.

06:34.640 --> 06:37.484
And I can't save you
from the consequences.

06:37.640 --> 06:39.608
What was he doing
out of the safe house?

06:39.760 --> 06:41.683
He thought Ruiz made him.
He ran.

06:41.840 --> 06:44.889
And you couldn't
talk him out of that?

06:45.040 --> 06:47.850
We didn't speak exactly.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.321
He left me a message
saying he was blown.

06:50.480 --> 06:53.802
You had a witness
who was scared for his life,

06:53.960 --> 06:56.167
the biggest lead in your case,

06:56.320 --> 06:58.527
and you missed his call?

07:00.560 --> 07:03.643
What the hell were you doing
when that phone rang?

07:03.800 --> 07:06.565
I know you were trying
to save this case, Angela.

07:07.840 --> 07:10.241
Now you might have
to save your ass.

07:41.360 --> 07:44.762
<i>When did you first see the gun'?</i>

07:44.920 --> 07:47.924
After she pulled the trigger.

07:48.080 --> 07:50.845
And you followed her up the stairs
even though she was armed?

07:52.520 --> 07:55.729
Maybe I thought I could catch her.
Just an instinct.

07:55.880 --> 07:58.724
Most people's instinct
when they see danger

07:58.880 --> 08:00.723
is to head
in the opposite direction.

08:00.880 --> 08:04.202
One last question. The waitress
standing next to you was hit.

08:04.360 --> 08:06.010
What if that bullet
was meant for you?

08:06.160 --> 08:09.289
A man in your position
must have enemies.

08:09.440 --> 08:11.363
Can you think of anyone
who might want you dead?

08:11.520 --> 08:13.602
Anyone at all?

08:15.400 --> 08:17.641
No.

08:35.919 --> 08:38.764
Jamie, I'm sorry.
I should have called.

08:38.919 --> 08:42.606
I wouldn't have answered. Angela, there
was a shooting tonight at the club.

08:42.760 --> 08:44.330
Some woman got in with a gun.

08:44.480 --> 08:47.165
- Oh, my God. Jamie, are you...
- I'm okay.

08:47.320 --> 08:49.846
But a waitress got hit
and I don't know if she'll make it.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.243
There's no way I'll be able to go
with you to Miami tonight, I'm sorry.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.129
No, no, I understand.

08:55.280 --> 08:57.567
It's crazy here,
so I'll call you tomorrow.

08:57.760 --> 08:59.683
Angela, I love you.

09:01.560 --> 09:03.449
I love you, too, Jamie.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.682
Be right there, Ghost.

09:16.840 --> 09:19.491
You wait for me right there.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.128
Clear, please.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.930
This is Holly, you know what to do.

09:42.080 --> 09:44.811
Holly, baby.

09:44.960 --> 09:47.201
I got to be out
of town for a few days.

09:47.360 --> 09:50.967
I'll call you,
but I don't know when.

09:51.120 --> 09:53.930

09:56.960 --> 09:59.406

Dad, I should probably
go over there.

Ghost is all right.
Tasha just told you so.

11:16.120 --> 11:17.565

13:28.880 --> 13:32.362
You still ain't heard
from Tommy.

13:33.400 --> 13:35.400
Not since he texted me
saying he was coming to meet

13:35.425 --> 13:38.129
and never showed the fuck up.
Look, T, I'll be strapped.

13:38.280 --> 13:41.443
I got people watching the building,
so you and the kids are safe here.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.764
Y'all been getting hit

13:44.920 --> 13:47.446
and you didn't tell me
this whole time?

13:49.200 --> 13:51.851
I keep thinking
about Rolla being gone.

13:54.160 --> 13:57.164
I know how much
you loved that boy.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.923
You okay, Ghost?

14:03.760 --> 14:06.570
I'll be better,
soon as I find Tommy.

- Simon Stern.
- James, how are you?

15:04.920 --> 15:07.366
Well, I suppose I know
the answer to that question.

15:07.520 --> 15:10.205
- What do you want, Simon?
- To meet.

15:10.360 --> 15:12.488
Such a shame.

15:12.680 --> 15:15.160
Just when you were
about to break through.

15:15.320 --> 15:17.288
I trust you were not hurt.

15:17.440 --> 15:18.885
Physically, I mean.

15:19.040 --> 15:21.361
I know your wallet
must be taking a beating.

15:21.560 --> 15:23.005
Simon, what are you doing here?

15:23.160 --> 15:24.889
I know you have
better things to do

15:25.040 --> 15:27.240
than to take a stroll down 14th Street
this time of day.

15:27.265 --> 15:29.406
I came to see a friend in need
and to offer my help.

15:29.560 --> 15:32.723
There's a process for you
to get back to business.

15:32.880 --> 15:36.009
- I can smooth the way.
- In exchange for what?

15:36.200 --> 15:38.567
The proposal I made when you
came to dinner still stands.

15:38.720 --> 15:42.850
Damaged as it is, I'd still love
to make Truth part of my brand.

15:43.040 --> 15:45.566
I'd love to groom you.

15:47.560 --> 15:49.562
I don't need grooming.

15:49.760 --> 15:51.649
I don't need your help, Simon.

15:51.840 --> 15:55.003
I will have Truth back open
before you can buy your next wife.

15:55.160 --> 15:57.049
Who knows?

15:57.200 --> 15:59.646
Maybe I'll try
a younger man this time.

15:59.800 --> 16:01.609
Good luck, James.

16:01.760 --> 16:04.127
I'm sure you'll get it done.

16:04.280 --> 16:06.362
There's more than
one way to skin a cat.

16:09.920 --> 16:11.843
Tommy hasn't been here.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.695
All the money and shit in the safe
is all still there.

16:13.720 --> 16:15.404
He hasn't been in
the Wash and Fold either.

16:15.560 --> 16:17.255
He hasn't been to his place.
What about the car?

16:17.280 --> 16:19.248
Sent word to the chop shops
looking for parts.

16:19.400 --> 16:21.240
Usual muscle car guys
haven't seen the Mustang.

16:21.360 --> 16:24.200
If the car ain't stolen or abandoned,
then he could still be driving it.

16:24.225 --> 16:26.771
- Shooter?
- I called some friends in Miami.

16:26.960 --> 16:28.769
Sent them a picture of this.

16:28.960 --> 16:30.849
Just haven't heard back.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.526
All right, make sure you look
at more than Miami, Julito.

16:33.720 --> 16:35.680
She's got to have some kind
of connection locally.

16:35.705 --> 16:37.992
- Someone with resources.
- I'm on it.

16:38.440 --> 16:40.283
- Oh, boss.
- Yeah?

16:40.440 --> 16:42.283
One of Lobos's guys
reached out to me.

16:42.440 --> 16:43.920
Something about
a shipment on the way.

16:44.079 --> 16:45.763
Double the usual amount.
More than double.

16:45.919 --> 16:48.410
How we gonna move that?

16:48.560 --> 16:51.135
Our delivery business is already moving
the max amount of weight per day as is.

16:51.160 --> 16:53.003
We need to expand.
Add more primeras.

16:53.160 --> 16:55.055
Tommy's the one that had
the connect to Serb and Drifty.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.520
I can go see them, but they're
gonna want to know where he is.

16:57.545 --> 16:58.876
Then we need to find Tommy fast.

17:17.760 --> 17:20.491
It's good, yo.
I know this nigga.

17:21.599 --> 17:23.921
We got business to discuss.

17:24.079 --> 17:26.162
Without the audience, QDubs.

17:27.760 --> 17:31.207
Y'all good. Rolla got killed

17:31.400 --> 17:33.720
doing some "I don't need niggas
with me all the time" shit.

17:33.745 --> 17:35.529
I'm not the one.

17:35.680 --> 17:38.604
Streets don't got no idea
who pulled the trigger on him.

17:38.760 --> 17:41.366
Cops don't know shit.
But they never do.

17:41.520 --> 17:44.205
I can't figure out who it was.

17:44.360 --> 17:47.011
Unless it was
the fucking Soldados.

17:47.160 --> 17:49.447
But you wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

17:49.600 --> 17:52.490
I know you real
"habla espafiol" with Ruiz.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.847
Y'all go way back.
Y'all niggas roll tight.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.890
Don't nobody roll tight enough with me
to get away with killing Rolla.

18:03.680 --> 18:06.251
Don't forget
this was my neighborhood.

18:06.400 --> 18:08.448
Kanan, Tommy, and I
ran these streets.

18:08.600 --> 18:11.729
Anything Rolla gave you,
I gave him first.

18:11.880 --> 18:14.247
I'm trying to move product.

18:14.440 --> 18:16.488
More than twice the amount
of our usual drop.

18:16.640 --> 18:18.440
I'll give you a better deal
than I gave Rolla.

18:18.480 --> 18:20.767
And a bigger cut. Look at you.

18:20.920 --> 18:22.445
"Neighborhood boy made good"

18:22.600 --> 18:24.807
and now you want to give back
to the community and shit.

18:24.960 --> 18:27.691
It's about the money, QDubs.
Always about the money.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.763
That it is.

18:29.960 --> 18:33.601
Until a family member get clipped,
then this shit turn into something else.

18:37.440 --> 18:40.091
Let me talk to the homies
about whether or not we want

18:40.240 --> 18:42.402
to do business with a nigga
that fuck with the Ricans.

18:48.480 --> 18:51.848
If me and you work together
and I find out who did it,

18:52.000 --> 18:55.209
I'll kill the shooter myself.
Word is bond.

19:00.720 --> 19:05.567
Deal sound good.
Let me think about it for a minute.

19:07.080 --> 19:09.560
I'll hit you up.

19:11.080 --> 19:12.684
You do that.

19:24.480 --> 19:26.608
I thought you were going
to Miami.

19:26.760 --> 19:28.922
Trip's postponed.

19:29.080 --> 19:30.969
I fucked up, Greg.

19:31.120 --> 19:33.521
A man is dead
because I fucked up.

19:33.680 --> 19:35.409
Nomar was a pedophile, Angela.

19:35.560 --> 19:38.450
- He deserved what he got.
- Hear, hear.

19:40.640 --> 19:42.244
Who is that guy?

19:42.400 --> 19:44.482
Never seen him before. Saxe?

19:44.640 --> 19:47.962
He looks a little familiar.

19:50.440 --> 19:52.010
Frankie, what's going on?

19:52.160 --> 19:54.640
Consequences.

19:58.320 --> 20:02.769
We're here to discuss some changes
in our Felipe Lobos task force.

20:02.920 --> 20:06.367
I've been promoted to head up
Criminal Division in Northern Michigan

20:06.520 --> 20:09.364
and supervise our new
border task force there.

20:09.560 --> 20:12.291
- She's getting kicked upstairs.
- "Consequences"?

20:12.480 --> 20:16.166
I am honored
to have the opportunity.

20:16.360 --> 20:18.647
We're lucky enough
to have Miguel Sandoval

20:18.800 --> 20:20.689
from Southern California
District

20:20.840 --> 20:23.411
joining us to head
Criminal Division here.

20:23.560 --> 20:27.565
He'll be supervising the New York
Lobos task force from now on.

20:27.720 --> 20:30.610
Sandoval steered
the investigation in LA

20:30.760 --> 20:34.162
that almost indicted
Lobos last month.

20:35.480 --> 20:37.482
Thanks, Miss Lavarro.

20:37.640 --> 20:39.529
But as we all know,

20:39.680 --> 20:42.570
in law enforcement,
"almost" doesn't count.

20:42.760 --> 20:45.570
Our main witness,
Lobos's Los Angeles distributor,

20:45.760 --> 20:48.411
was murdered in our safe house
before he could testify

20:48.600 --> 20:50.040
while in the custody
of the marshals.

20:50.160 --> 20:51.924
We need to change our approach.

20:52.080 --> 20:53.525
Effective immediately,

20:53.680 --> 20:55.921
Cooper Saxe is the lead
AUSA on the Lobos case.

20:56.080 --> 20:58.208
All other AUSAs
will report to him.

20:58.400 --> 21:00.846
And all paperwork
will cross his desk. Coop?

21:01.000 --> 21:03.446
Thanks, Mike.

21:03.600 --> 21:07.571
So now I report to a total asshole
who used to report to me.

21:07.720 --> 21:09.609
That is, I report to him
until I get fired,

21:09.760 --> 21:11.842
which could happen
at any minute.

21:12.880 --> 21:15.008
We should be in Miami right now.

21:15.160 --> 21:17.686
We should be tan.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.527
I'm sorry.

21:21.680 --> 21:23.523
No, it's okay.
I was thinking it, too.

21:23.680 --> 21:26.251
It's like everything
I put together,

21:26.400 --> 21:28.448
it was all gone in one night.

21:32.080 --> 21:34.447
I'm so sorry this happened.

21:34.640 --> 21:37.007
I know how much
the club means to you.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.526
I wish I could help.

21:41.680 --> 21:46.163
This helps.
Being here with you like this.

21:55.720 --> 21:58.166
I got to go, baby.

22:06.800 --> 22:08.370
Where'd you tell Ghost
you had to go?

22:08.520 --> 22:11.285
He gave me the rest
of the day off.

22:11.440 --> 22:14.091
Why haven't you gone
to see Uncle G yet, Dad?

22:14.240 --> 22:16.766
I feel weird not telling him
that you're out.

22:16.920 --> 22:19.080
Me staying away from your uncle
while he's got problems

22:19.105 --> 22:20.186
is a sign of respect, son.

22:20.280 --> 22:22.965
Can't show up with my hand out
while he's trying to fix his shit.

22:23.120 --> 22:25.168
Yeah, but he's just
gonna want to help you.

22:25.360 --> 22:27.283
No matter what. He said so.

22:27.440 --> 22:29.880
I can't hold a nigga to no promises
under these circumstances.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.401
I get my shit together,
I go see him, offer my help.

22:32.560 --> 22:35.769
Hold this.
I ain't gonna be but a minute.

22:41.720 --> 22:43.609
You gonna have to call
that motherfucker back.

22:48.400 --> 22:51.370
Where's your bitch, bitch?
Where your puto?

22:53.040 --> 22:55.930
I want my down payment.
With interest.

22:56.080 --> 22:57.809
I can give you your money.

22:57.960 --> 22:59.962
But she ran.
I don't know where she is.

23:00.120 --> 23:02.043
Wrong answer, motherfucker.

23:06.040 --> 23:08.281
Okay, just give me
a couple days.

23:08.440 --> 23:11.205
I can find her for you.
I'll find her, I promise.

23:20.440 --> 23:23.284
- You better not warn her.
- I won't. I won't breathe a word.

23:23.440 --> 23:25.568
I swear on my kids
I won't say anything.

23:25.720 --> 23:27.848
Swear on your own life.
It's more likely to matter.

23:33.440 --> 23:35.124
I'll be back.
And I have boys watching you,

23:35.280 --> 23:36.645
so don't try to run.
You hear me?

23:36.800 --> 23:38.325
Yes.

23:42.560 --> 23:44.722
Let's go get some
fucking egg rolls, kid.

23:44.880 --> 23:49.602
That shit made me hungry.
You hungry? Come on.

23:53.200 --> 23:55.601
Tariq asked about Tommy again.

23:55.760 --> 23:57.888
Nobody's heard anything,
nobody's seen anything.

23:58.080 --> 24:00.560
No sign of him.
No sign of the car. Nothing.

24:00.720 --> 24:02.768
You check
the Underground Railroad?

24:02.960 --> 24:06.203
Every stop.
He hadn't been to any of them.

24:06.360 --> 24:09.569
He didn't run anywhere.
And if they know where to find me,

24:09.720 --> 24:12.610
then they'll know
where to find him, T.

24:12.800 --> 24:16.441
I'm tapped. I got to move
all over the city with the drug shit.

24:16.640 --> 24:17.926
I got to get the club back open.

24:18.080 --> 24:19.605
Truth? Why?

24:19.760 --> 24:22.001
We got the Wash and Folds.

24:22.160 --> 24:24.640
Tasha, how many times
have we talked about this?

24:24.800 --> 24:27.531
We clean five times
the amount of cash in the club

24:27.680 --> 24:30.286
in one fucking night than
the Wash and Folds do in a week.

24:30.440 --> 24:32.568
- Then we open a new club.
- With what?

24:32.720 --> 24:35.530
We don't have enough legit cash
on hand to open a club fast.

24:35.680 --> 24:37.840
We can't get more legit cash
unless we clean the money.

24:37.865 --> 24:40.232
And we can't clean
the money without a club.

24:41.440 --> 24:44.330
And if I can pull this off,
we got more money

24:44.480 --> 24:46.720
coming through the drug business
than we ever had before.

24:46.745 --> 24:48.668
Lobos is sending twice
the amount of product.

24:52.880 --> 24:55.690
So now I got no club,

24:55.840 --> 24:57.808
dead or distrusting primeras,

24:57.960 --> 25:01.442
and a fucking mountain
of cocaine

25:01.640 --> 25:03.847
with no Tommy
to help me move it.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.721
You got me.
I've helped you before, remember?

25:07.880 --> 25:09.564
Show me.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.649
All right,
it's not about the weight.

25:22.800 --> 25:24.760
We could move it
if the organization was straight.

25:24.840 --> 25:26.808
But it's all fucked up.

25:29.360 --> 25:31.567
Ruiz controls this area.

25:31.720 --> 25:33.760
And he and Tommy made
an agreement to work together,

25:33.785 --> 25:35.967
but Ruiz wants to run guns, too,
so he might back out.

25:36.120 --> 25:38.009
Tommy knows a cat
named Drifty in Newark.

25:38.160 --> 25:39.764
Wanted to work with us
in the past

25:39.920 --> 25:41.760
when Tommy was trying
to convince me to expand.

25:43.440 --> 25:45.249
Like the Serb who's got
the Lower East Side

25:45.400 --> 25:48.529
and Staten Island on lock,
but he's got his own connect already.

25:48.680 --> 25:51.650
Look, if you need to expand,
fuck a connect.

25:51.800 --> 25:55.282
You may need to think about
taking that territory.

25:55.440 --> 25:57.761
Kill the Serb?

25:57.920 --> 26:00.321
Come on, Tasha.
I can't start a war now.

26:00.480 --> 26:03.290
It only starts a war
if they know you did it.

26:07.440 --> 26:09.488
Serbians, RSKs, Puerto Ricans.

26:09.640 --> 26:12.962
If I pull this off,
the network gets fractured as hell.

26:13.120 --> 26:15.885
Tommy was the glue.

26:16.040 --> 26:18.361
But you,

26:18.520 --> 26:21.410
you can do it
if you have to without him.

26:23.200 --> 26:26.329
Look, you get Ruiz
to agree first, right?

26:26.520 --> 26:28.682
Then you go across
the bridge to Drifty.

26:28.840 --> 26:32.287
If Ruiz says no,
then the RSKs are in, right?

26:32.480 --> 26:34.482
You move on to the Serb.

26:34.640 --> 26:36.608
You got to make it work,
so you will.

26:36.760 --> 26:38.000
I know you will.

26:40.920 --> 26:42.285
Thank you.

26:45.240 --> 26:47.368
Without Tommy, I need your help.

26:51.600 --> 26:54.206
You got me, Ghost.

26:54.360 --> 26:56.522
Always have.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.362
There's just one thing
I need you to do for me.

27:03.240 --> 27:06.926
Stop seeing Angela.

27:09.280 --> 27:11.044
Your phone.

27:11.200 --> 27:13.726
Should have been more
careful with your phone.

27:17.800 --> 27:20.280
I'll handle it.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.367
When do you think
you can move in?

27:45.520 --> 27:47.966
I know we need
to get a bigger place

27:48.120 --> 27:50.885
so your kids have somewhere
to sleep when they visit.

27:53.880 --> 27:56.008
I know that's what
we talked about.

28:03.240 --> 28:05.607
- Because of the club?
- Because of everything.

28:05.760 --> 28:10.243
Angie, the club being closed
means my money is tight.

28:10.400 --> 28:11.970
I don't want your money.

28:12.120 --> 28:14.122
Yeah, but Tasha does.

28:16.560 --> 28:20.360
A divorce right now, you know
the financial impact would be huge.

28:20.520 --> 28:23.285
If I'm gonna blow my life up
while everything else is up in the air,

28:23.440 --> 28:25.680
I don't know what would be left
for us on the other side.

28:33.440 --> 28:35.520
Pero... I couldn't have seen
all of this happening...

28:35.600 --> 28:38.410
The club, the shooting,
my kids being scared,

28:38.560 --> 28:40.562
needing me
to be around for them.

28:40.720 --> 28:43.007
My situation has changed.

28:43.160 --> 28:46.243
That's all.

28:46.400 --> 28:48.721
Not the way I feel about you.

28:54.560 --> 28:56.483
This isn't going
to happen, is it?

28:56.640 --> 29:00.167
- That's not what I'm saying, Angie.
- I know.

29:00.320 --> 29:04.564
But when we were together as kids,
we were separated, right?

29:04.760 --> 29:07.047
I had no idea I was ever
going to see you again.

29:09.840 --> 29:12.002
<i>L</i> gave UP-

29:13.240 --> 29:16.449
We meet again...

29:16.600 --> 29:18.204
and I felt like that meant

29:18.400 --> 29:21.131
we were always
supposed to be together.

29:21.320 --> 29:24.244
Like we were meant to be.

29:26.080 --> 29:27.684
I keep hoping I'll wake up

29:27.840 --> 29:29.842
and up will be down,
left will be right.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.048
I don't want to look
at what's real.

29:41.480 --> 29:44.165
Maybe you were right
to give up back then, Jamie.

29:44.320 --> 29:46.800
Maybe we should now.

29:50.920 --> 29:52.843
Come on, Angie.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.209
It's just like it was
when we were kids.

29:56.360 --> 29:58.010
You and me against the world.

29:58.160 --> 30:00.527
Except now it feels like
the world is winning.

30:00.680 --> 30:03.889
Angie, I need you
to be strong for me.

30:04.040 --> 30:06.520
If everything else
is falling apart around us,

30:06.680 --> 30:08.967
we got to be strong
for each other.

30:09.160 --> 30:10.764
Okay?

30:13.520 --> 30:15.682
My plans haven't changed.
Not one bit.

30:15.840 --> 30:19.242
Just gonna need to spend
more time around home, that's all.

30:19.400 --> 30:21.641
We'll be together, I promise.

30:24.920 --> 30:27.400
I mean, the kids are okay,
I guess.

30:27.560 --> 30:30.404
They just want Ghost
in the house all the time.

30:30.560 --> 30:33.245
I wish he'd pay them
a little more mind and stay home.

30:33.400 --> 30:35.243
You staying with
the cheating-ass nigga.

30:35.400 --> 30:37.323
I bet you do wish
his ass would stay home.

30:37.520 --> 30:39.807
You know what?
The shooting, it refocused Ghost.

30:39.960 --> 30:41.689
He knows he needs me.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.888
I asked him to end it with her
and he said he would.

30:45.560 --> 30:46.846
Don't look at me like that.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.490
How do you want me
to look at you?

30:48.640 --> 30:50.768
You falling for a line
of bullshit like that?

30:50.920 --> 30:53.321
There are reasons
I know I can believe him.

30:53.480 --> 30:55.200
Reasons your simple ass
wouldn't understand.

30:55.240 --> 30:58.323
Okay, I'm simple, right?
Well, if you trust him so much,

30:58.480 --> 31:00.369
then tell me why you need this.

31:00.520 --> 31:04.127
- You opened my mail?
- You sent it to my house.

31:04.280 --> 31:06.203
Girl, you hiding money
from Ghost?

31:06.360 --> 31:08.203
Looks like an escape plan to me.

31:10.200 --> 31:13.966
He's my husband, Keisha.
I can't just walk away like that.

31:14.120 --> 31:16.691
If there's a way
we can make it work,

31:16.840 --> 31:18.649
I got to make it work.

31:18.800 --> 31:21.007
Look, T,

31:21.160 --> 31:23.766
you know I'm gonna be here
for you no matter what.

31:23.920 --> 31:26.526
I just hope you know
what you're doing.

31:38.400 --> 31:40.129
Hey, yo.

31:40.280 --> 31:42.647
You know where you at, man?

31:42.800 --> 31:45.041
Yeah, I know where I'm at.

31:45.200 --> 31:47.248
You look lost.

31:52.160 --> 31:54.766
Sit down, Broc.

31:54.920 --> 31:57.161
What's up, man?

31:57.320 --> 31:59.288
- Good to see you, man.
- Yeah, man, it is.

31:59.440 --> 32:01.560
Hey, man, this is the nigga
I was telling y'all about.

32:01.710 --> 32:03.553
This is Kanan.
This is the OG right here.

32:03.710 --> 32:05.720
All right.

32:07.200 --> 32:09.168
So Ghost is alive?

32:09.360 --> 32:11.886
Yeah. If he had been dead
when I got out like we'd planned,

32:12.040 --> 32:15.442
- you'd have met Tommy already.
- Tommy is...?

32:15.600 --> 32:17.200
Tommy's the white boy
rolling with Ghost.

32:17.280 --> 32:18.930
They tight like a pair of balls.

32:19.120 --> 32:20.929
You can't get one
without the other.

32:21.120 --> 32:24.010
I was gonna play Tommy
till he introduced me to the connect,

32:24.160 --> 32:26.080
then clip his cracker ass
and run the whole shit.

32:26.160 --> 32:29.164
So why we gotta change the plan?
Fuck that. Let's clip Ghost now.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.889
Now that I'm out,
it'll trace back to me.

32:33.040 --> 32:35.646
We kill Ghost now, we'll have war
with Tommy within a week.

32:35.800 --> 32:37.255
We ain't gonna get
to the connect like that.

32:37.280 --> 32:38.691
This way, the dumb motherfucker

32:38.840 --> 32:41.127
will be so happy to see me,
he'll shit his pants.

32:41.280 --> 32:43.806
With Ghost alive,
the best way for me to approach this

32:43.960 --> 32:46.000
is to attack from the inside.
Bring you in that way.

32:46.080 --> 32:48.811
Yeah, well, look, fam,

32:48.960 --> 32:52.806
I told the fellas what you did for me
on the inside.

32:52.960 --> 32:56.089
I would have came out
under a sheet if it wasn't for you.

32:56.280 --> 32:58.806
Look, I've been building this crew
since I got out, man.

32:58.960 --> 33:01.281
They follow me
and I'll follow you.

33:01.440 --> 33:03.283
They're ready to die
if they have to.

33:03.440 --> 33:05.124
Real shit.

33:05.280 --> 33:07.681
And I got a man already planted
in their organization.

33:07.880 --> 33:09.530
He'll tell me anything
I want to know.

33:09.680 --> 33:11.842
Who?

33:12.000 --> 33:14.048
My son.

33:24.840 --> 33:26.968
Tommy told me you signed on.

33:27.120 --> 33:29.320
I just wanted to make sure
the air was clear between us.

33:29.345 --> 33:32.269
We're good. Once you killed Rolla,
you and I were straight.

33:34.120 --> 33:36.600
Still convinced that Rolla
was behind the attempt on your life?

33:37.920 --> 33:40.366
Nothing else makes sense.

33:40.520 --> 33:44.206
You still in business with those...

33:56.800 --> 33:58.880
Except for guns.
I can't expand to weapons right now.

34:11.520 --> 34:14.000
I'll be in touch about a drop.

34:14.159 --> 34:16.083
Ghost.

34:16.280 --> 34:18.362
There's just one more thing
I require.

34:18.520 --> 34:20.966
A seat at the table.

34:21.159 --> 34:23.606
I want to make decisions.
Approve personnel.

34:23.760 --> 34:25.639
I want choices about
who I'm doing business with

34:25.665 --> 34:27.588
so I don't get hit again.

34:29.080 --> 34:30.445
I'll discuss it with Tommy.

34:30.600 --> 34:34.241
Of course. How's he doing?

34:34.400 --> 34:37.324
He's fine. I'll tell him
you asked about him.

34:48.880 --> 34:50.962
No, T, he hasn't been to the hospital.
I checked.

34:51.120 --> 34:53.964
Did you go over to Holly's?

34:54.120 --> 34:56.929
He hasn't been there either?

34:57.080 --> 34:59.287
I know.

34:59.440 --> 35:01.568
But look, I got to go
to the community board now.

35:04.680 --> 35:07.081
Tasha, I don't know
where else to look.

35:07.240 --> 35:09.891
I've looked everywhere.

35:10.080 --> 35:12.321
Let me call you back.

35:18.280 --> 35:21.363
- Hello?
- Kate, it's Jamie St. Patrick.

35:21.520 --> 35:24.091
Jamie, don't be silly.

35:24.240 --> 35:27.210
- I know your voice. How are you?
- I'm well, thanks for asking.

35:27.360 --> 35:30.842
- The family? Tasha?
- Everybody's good.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.200
Look, Kate, have you seen Tommy
in the last couple days?

35:33.225 --> 35:35.400
- Is he out there?
- Tommy Egan? My son?

35:35.560 --> 35:39.406
I seem to vaguely remember giving birth
to an ungrateful bastard.

35:39.560 --> 35:42.006
That boy hasn't called me
for weeks.

35:42.200 --> 35:44.885
Probably changed his number again
so I wouldn't find him.

35:45.040 --> 35:47.880
Well, when I find him, I'll tell him
to give you a call, how about that?

35:47.960 --> 35:49.928
He always listens to you, Jamie.

35:50.120 --> 35:52.805
Kate, how about I come out
next week and check on you?

35:53.000 --> 35:54.680
You know, just to see
if you need anything.

35:54.705 --> 35:57.529
No, no. I'm okay.
Look, I know how busy you are.

35:57.680 --> 35:59.125
You don't need
to bother yourself.

35:59.280 --> 36:01.851
Okay, if you're sure.
I'll have Tommy call you then.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.765
- Bye, Kate.
- Bye.

36:07.920 --> 36:09.843
How was that?

36:10.000 --> 36:13.925
Pretty fucking good.
He won't suspect a thing.

36:14.080 --> 36:16.447
You sounded like
your usual crazy self.

36:16.600 --> 36:19.400
I'm crazy? You're the one who thinks
his best friend has turned on him.

36:19.520 --> 36:21.170
He's practically your brother.

36:21.360 --> 36:23.681
You can't trust him no more, Ma.
He changed.

36:23.840 --> 36:26.002
I told you he's cheating
on Tasha with that girl.

36:26.200 --> 36:28.362
Angela Valdes from high school.
You said.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.045
He's gonna leave town with her.

36:30.200 --> 36:32.043
He's probably calling you
from fucking Brazil.

36:32.200 --> 36:35.283
I don't know. It's all fucked up
and I can't trust him right now.

36:35.440 --> 36:38.091
I can't trust nobody.
Except Holly.

36:38.240 --> 36:40.402
If you trust that girl
so much, where is she?

36:40.560 --> 36:42.320
I don't know.
I'm looking for her everywhere.

36:42.360 --> 36:43.930
I called her cell
like a hundred times.

36:44.080 --> 36:46.367
Maybe she don't want
to talk to you.

36:46.520 --> 36:49.205
What's the last thing
you said to her?

36:49.360 --> 36:52.250
You didn't tell her
you loved her, did you?

36:53.800 --> 36:56.531
That kind of talk
scares weak women away.

36:56.680 --> 36:59.160
Holly ain't scared.
And she ain't weak.

36:59.360 --> 37:01.200
I had to ditch my cell
and she ain't picking up

37:01.349 --> 37:02.839
'cause she don't
recognize the number.

37:02.989 --> 37:05.484
She's smart like that.
You'd like her, Ma.

37:05.640 --> 37:08.166
I don't know her friends.
No one's picking up at Truth.

37:08.320 --> 37:10.209
Who knows what the fuck
is going on there?

37:10.360 --> 37:12.015
I can't tell Kantos nothing
'cause that little bitch

37:12.040 --> 37:13.644
will rat me out to Ghost
so fucking fast.

37:13.800 --> 37:16.371
Well, Jamie's not gonna think
about looking for you here.

37:16.520 --> 37:18.204
'Cause you think
I'm an ungrateful bastard?

37:18.360 --> 37:21.250
You are. And if you keep doing
all my fucking blow,

37:21.400 --> 37:23.641
we're gonna run out.

37:32.800 --> 37:36.088
If that girl loved you
the way you love her,

37:36.240 --> 37:38.163
she would be here with you now

37:38.320 --> 37:40.687
in your time
of trouble like I am.

37:40.840 --> 37:44.447
Right, baby?

37:44.600 --> 37:47.046
I'm so glad you're here, Tommy.

37:47.240 --> 37:49.607
You are?

37:49.760 --> 37:52.445
So glad, you hit me with a bat?

37:52.600 --> 37:55.888
Next time, ring
the fucking doorbell.

38:14.360 --> 38:18.285
- Who's this?
- My daughter.

38:24.200 --> 38:27.329
Thanks. Her mother's idea.

38:29.720 --> 38:32.803
Why don't we skip
the formalities here?

38:32.960 --> 38:36.931
I know all about you and your
track record on this Lobos case.

38:37.120 --> 38:39.521
Corners cut, a botched raid.

38:39.680 --> 38:42.001
First a dead primera
and now a dead Cl

38:42.160 --> 38:44.811
who you jerry-rigged into the
WITSEC program in the first place.

38:44.960 --> 38:48.203
Nomar Arcielo should still be alive
and we both know it.

38:48.360 --> 38:51.364
You're not only no longer leading
the Lobos task force,

38:51.520 --> 38:54.649
you're not on it at all.

38:56.280 --> 38:59.124
Sir, I've devoted over a year
to this case.

38:59.280 --> 39:01.567
I'm dedicated, committed.

39:01.720 --> 39:04.405
Before he died,
Nomar told me he was stabbed

39:04.560 --> 39:06.085
by Lobos's New York distributor

39:06.280 --> 39:08.726
who we believe goes
by the street name "Ghost."

39:08.880 --> 39:12.805
Nomar worked with a sketch artist
that day by phone.

39:12.960 --> 39:14.610
You have a sketch
of the distributor?

39:14.760 --> 39:17.331
A partial. But if I could just
get the resources

39:17.480 --> 39:19.562
I need to complete the sketch...

39:19.720 --> 39:21.529
I can get a list
of phone numbers

39:21.680 --> 39:24.251
Nomar called when he was
on Ruiz's bodyguard detail.

39:24.400 --> 39:26.528
Men that would have seen
this distributor.

39:26.680 --> 39:29.365
I can talk to them,
finish the sketch,

39:29.520 --> 39:32.842
ID Ghost, and get him to flip
on Lobos like you did in LA.

39:33.000 --> 39:36.049
You're gonna get
some hardcore Soldados

39:36.200 --> 39:38.160
to flip on a man who just killed
one of their own?

39:38.185 --> 39:40.267
That's your plan?

39:43.760 --> 39:45.200
How would you even
get their numbers?

39:45.225 --> 39:48.363
By now, Nomar Arcielo's cell is in
an evidence locker at Queens North.

39:48.520 --> 39:50.160
You can't look at it
without a court order

39:50.240 --> 39:52.368
and I'm not gonna
help you get one.

39:53.840 --> 39:55.888
You've wasted enough
department resources.

39:57.600 --> 39:59.648
I'm reassigning you
to White Collar.

40:00.840 --> 40:03.241
They need an extra body.

40:03.400 --> 40:06.051
Now, you've got arraignments
this afternoon.

40:06.200 --> 40:08.680
Don't be late.

41:02.760 --> 41:05.366
Senora.

41:07.640 --> 41:09.529
Gracias, Señor Ruiz.

42:23.360 --> 42:25.089
Mrs. Walters, in the 28 years

42:25.240 --> 42:27.360
your family has owned and operated
your jewelry store,

42:27.400 --> 42:29.289
how many times
have you been robbed?

42:29.480 --> 42:31.369
Five or so.

42:31.520 --> 42:33.921
And did you shut down
and quit? No.

42:34.080 --> 42:36.003
You turned your family business

42:36.160 --> 42:38.242
into one of the biggest
diamond dealers in the city.

42:38.400 --> 42:41.768
Mr. Clemente, 21 years ago when
the health board tried to shut you down,

42:41.920 --> 42:44.287
you challenged
their ruling and won.

42:44.440 --> 42:46.124
And, Mr. Meeks,
had it not been for you

42:46.280 --> 42:48.760
overcoming the loss
of your first big case as an ADA,

42:48.960 --> 42:51.440
you wouldn't have turned into one
of the most respected lawyers

42:51.465 --> 42:52.644
in all of New York.

42:52.840 --> 42:55.081
It's not how
or why you fall down,

42:55.240 --> 42:57.288
it's what you do
after you get up.

42:57.440 --> 43:00.683
All any of us need
is a second chance.

43:00.840 --> 43:02.410
But this isn't
your first misstep.

43:02.600 --> 43:04.807
Recently there was
an overdose at Truth.

43:04.960 --> 43:06.450
Why should we overlook
these incidents

43:06.640 --> 43:09.723
and give you
that "second chance"?

43:12.960 --> 43:15.725
You did the right thing
by giving me the first chance.

43:15.880 --> 43:18.451
All I ask is for the opportunity

43:18.600 --> 43:20.125
to prove that
what happened that night

43:20.320 --> 43:23.324
was the exception
and not the rule.

43:23.480 --> 43:26.927
That I am the exception,
not the rule.

43:37.480 --> 43:40.131
I heard you were making
a presentation to the board.

43:42.560 --> 43:44.642
So how did it go?

43:44.800 --> 43:48.202
I got the approval.
I'm sure you were hoping I would fail.

43:48.360 --> 43:50.806
Now all I need to do
is call my landlord,

43:50.960 --> 43:54.248
get the sign-off,
and we're open for business.

43:54.440 --> 43:57.489
You don't need to call
your landlord.

43:58.960 --> 44:01.088
I'm standing right here.

44:06.360 --> 44:08.442
You bought the building?

44:10.280 --> 44:13.124
The night we had dinner
at my house...

44:13.280 --> 44:16.045
Such a spirited discussion...

44:16.200 --> 44:19.204
I reached out to your landlord
the next morning

44:19.360 --> 44:21.249
and paid him 10% over market.

44:21.400 --> 44:24.131
All he had to do was agree
not to say a word to you.

44:24.280 --> 44:27.090
It was worth it just to see the look
on your face right now.

44:27.240 --> 44:29.163
Adorable.

44:29.320 --> 44:33.006
The force majeure clause.
You terminated my lease.

44:33.160 --> 44:35.162
Isn't that what you
would do in my shoes?

44:35.320 --> 44:37.721
You've already gotten
the space reinspected.

44:37.880 --> 44:39.880
The board sign-off will trigger
the liquor license.

44:39.920 --> 44:43.527
It's all done
thanks to your hard work.

44:43.680 --> 44:46.604
I'm ready to reopen Truth
with or without you.

44:46.760 --> 44:48.000
Without me, it isn't Truth.

44:48.200 --> 44:50.362
True.

44:50.520 --> 44:52.409
We'll probably
have to rename the club.

44:52.560 --> 44:56.929
What do you think of Coquette?

44:58.200 --> 45:00.123
Well played, Simon.

45:00.280 --> 45:02.521
Thing is, James,
you're actually better than I am.

45:02.720 --> 45:04.449
You're more creative.
You're faster.

45:04.600 --> 45:07.171
You're... younger.

45:07.320 --> 45:09.004
But you're not focused.

45:09.160 --> 45:11.891
If you were, I could never
have beat you this way.

45:12.040 --> 45:15.283
A man with more ready capital would
have walked away, opened a new club.

45:15.480 --> 45:19.565
But you killed yourself
to get Truth open again.

45:19.720 --> 45:22.326
It shows me you have
too much invested

45:22.480 --> 45:25.563
financially and emotionally

45:25.720 --> 45:27.961
to walk away now.

45:28.160 --> 45:30.731
Come work for me, James,
and I will make you the man

45:30.880 --> 45:34.123
you always wanted to be.

45:54.120 --> 45:56.168
Barely recognized you
looking like that.

45:56.320 --> 46:00.803
Went to Nomar's wake.
Had to blend in.

46:06.240 --> 46:08.561
So what's Mike's new strategy?

46:10.200 --> 46:13.682
Mike has specifically
forbidden us

46:13.840 --> 46:15.763
to talk about the Lobos
investigation

46:15.920 --> 46:17.524
with anyone who's not
on the task force.

46:17.680 --> 46:20.126
Anyone, or me?

46:23.040 --> 46:26.931
Did it occur to you
that... even for a second...

46:27.080 --> 46:30.687
That because I helped you
get Nomar into WITSEC

46:30.840 --> 46:32.360
that maybe my ass
was on the line, too?

46:32.385 --> 46:35.011
- Mike called you out?
- He asked me why I did it.

46:35.160 --> 46:37.128
He accepted my explanation

46:37.280 --> 46:39.362
and he let me stay on the case.

46:39.560 --> 46:41.688
I want Lobos, too, Angela.

46:41.840 --> 46:44.650
And I'm not gonna blow my shot
by just spilling to you.

46:46.120 --> 46:49.010
I'm sorry, Greg.

47:02.920 --> 47:06.641
If you had a real lead for Ghost,
Mike wouldn't ignore that.

47:06.840 --> 47:09.047
He wants the collar too badly.

47:11.160 --> 47:13.481
All I've got is a sketch
and I can't even finish it.

47:13.680 --> 47:17.571
It's not like anyone who saw Ghost
or Ruiz's hideout is gonna talk to me.

47:26.720 --> 47:29.007
Good night, Greg.

48:29.560 --> 48:31.608
So you told Stern you'd do it?

48:31.800 --> 48:33.290
I told him I'd think about it.

48:33.440 --> 48:36.808
Good. People like to hear
what they want to hear.

48:38.360 --> 48:40.681
T, that other thing
you asked me to do...

48:42.560 --> 48:44.927
it's taken care of.

48:46.120 --> 48:48.088
T, I reached out to Kate.

48:48.240 --> 48:50.208
She said that Tommy
didn't show up there either.

48:51.920 --> 48:54.605
Kate says a lot of things
with her crazy ass.

48:54.760 --> 48:57.525
Remember that time
she said she was "clean"?

48:57.680 --> 49:00.490
That she gave up
pills and coke for good?

49:06.600 --> 49:09.046
She didn't ask me to come out.
It's not like her.

49:09.200 --> 49:11.771
Maybe I should go
check it out for myself.

49:30.600 --> 49:33.331
Kate, I know you're there.
It's me, Jamie.

49:33.480 --> 49:36.484
Can I come in?

49:36.640 --> 49:38.961
Jamie, I got
a terrible headache.

49:39.160 --> 49:41.208
Can you come back another day?

49:41.360 --> 49:43.522
I brought you a gift, Kate.

49:54.960 --> 49:57.531
You were always such
a thoughtful boy, Jamie.

49:57.720 --> 50:00.041
You could teach Tommy
a thing or two.

50:01.840 --> 50:03.922
- Where is he?
- Hey!

50:05.640 --> 50:08.769
- Right here, Ghost.
- Tommy.

50:13.880 --> 50:17.089
- What the fuck is going on?
- Ma, go upstairs.

50:20.840 --> 50:23.081
You, go in the den.

50:29.360 --> 50:31.761
Tommy, come on, man.
What the fuck?

50:31.960 --> 50:33.246
- Tommy!
- Shut up!

50:33.400 --> 50:35.641
Sit there. Go on.

50:39.520 --> 50:41.045
Why'd you have
to come out here, man?

50:41.200 --> 50:43.248
Couldn't have left
well enough alone?

50:43.400 --> 50:45.375
I've been looking for you everywhere.
I've been calling you.

50:45.400 --> 50:47.164
Why are you out here
at Kate's house?

50:47.320 --> 50:49.243
So you and Angela can't find me.

50:49.440 --> 50:50.885
Me and Angela?

50:51.040 --> 50:53.122
It all makes fucking sense now.

50:53.320 --> 50:55.049
"Take all the drug
business, Tommy.

50:55.200 --> 50:57.009
You'll be the face
in the streets."

50:57.160 --> 50:59.925
Telling me I'm smart.
I can take control.

51:00.080 --> 51:02.731
All so you pin all
this whole shit on me.

51:02.880 --> 51:05.201
I go to fucking prison

51:05.360 --> 51:07.175
and you and Angela run off
into the fucking sunset.

51:07.200 --> 51:08.725
I can't believe
you did me like this.

51:08.880 --> 51:10.760
Tommy, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

51:10.785 --> 51:14.411
Stop, Ghost. Just stop.

51:14.560 --> 51:17.564
I saw the bags
in Angela's apartment.

51:17.760 --> 51:20.081
What the fuck you doing
in Angela's apartment?

51:20.240 --> 51:22.083
Shut the fuck up, Ghost.

51:22.240 --> 51:24.242
You were leaving with her.
Deny it.

51:26.040 --> 51:28.122
Go ahead.

51:28.280 --> 51:32.968
We were going to Miami.
It had nothing to do with you.

51:33.120 --> 51:34.406
Bullshit!

51:34.560 --> 51:37.291
I went there to kill that bitch
to protect you.

51:37.440 --> 51:40.364
To protect us. But then I see
that you're leaving with her.

51:40.520 --> 51:43.649
'Cause you made a deal
with that Fed cunt to sell me out.

51:43.800 --> 51:45.370
- What?!
- Angela!

51:45.520 --> 51:47.045
A federal prosecutor.

51:47.200 --> 51:49.362
A goddamn
United States Attorney.

51:51.920 --> 51:53.809
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

51:54.000 --> 51:55.525
No way.

51:55.680 --> 51:57.921
Don't you fucking lie to me,
Ghost.

51:59.440 --> 52:02.808
I heard the bitch say it.

52:08.040 --> 52:11.044
You didn't know.

52:15.360 --> 52:17.931
She told me she was a lawyer
for the government.

52:18.080 --> 52:20.321
What kind of lawyers you think
work for the government?

52:20.480 --> 52:23.404
I looked her up.

52:23.560 --> 52:26.609
No information anywhere.
She's probably undercover or some shit.

52:26.760 --> 52:28.808
I wasn't playing you, Tommy.
I was getting played.

52:28.960 --> 52:32.362
That bitch's pussy got you
"stuck on stupid" again.

52:33.680 --> 52:36.729
Just like when we was kids.

52:36.920 --> 52:38.888
I've been thinking about this.

52:39.040 --> 52:40.804
It could be none of this
is coincidence.

52:40.960 --> 52:44.726
Her coming into the club,
the two of you hooking up.

52:44.880 --> 52:46.803
I'll bet she knows
everything about you.

52:46.960 --> 52:49.247
Everything about us.

52:49.400 --> 52:51.243
Bet she's known all along.

52:54.280 --> 52:56.203
Let's go.

52:56.400 --> 52:58.562
Right now.

52:59.880 --> 53:01.644
Take her out.

53:03.520 --> 53:06.285
Come on. You with me?

53:09.600 --> 53:12.331
- We need to think first.
- You always want to think, Ghost.

53:12.480 --> 53:14.369
But I think
when it comes to Angela,

53:14.520 --> 53:16.640
we both know that you ain't
been thinking too clearly.

53:16.760 --> 53:19.206
What, you want to give that bitch
more time to arrest us?

53:20.720 --> 53:22.370
If you can't do it,

53:22.520 --> 53:24.887
I'll go there
and I'll do it myself.

53:27.120 --> 53:31.011
You say you didn't know.
You say she tricked you.

53:31.160 --> 53:32.525
Come with me now.

53:32.680 --> 53:34.000
I got to tell you
something first.

53:34.025 --> 53:36.162
Tell me in the car. Come on.

53:36.320 --> 53:39.767
It's about Holly. She got shot.

53:42.200 --> 53:44.009
