on the signature dish challenge.

01:05.686 --> 01:07.274
This is not what I picked.

01:07.377 --> 01:10.449
I'm pushing you to thelimit, and it begins right now.

01:10.553 --> 01:11.381
Let's go.

01:11.485 --> 01:12.865
Let's go guys.

01:12.969 --> 01:14.419

Elise, it's the
second 5 of the night.

01:37.476 --> 01:39.306

01:39.409 --> 01:41.929
NARRATOR: Both got themaximum score for their teams.

01:42.032 --> 01:44.345

- 1 out of 5.
- Oh

01:45.346 --> 01:46.140
Oh.

01:54.355 --> 01:55.425
I ask it yes and no questions.

01:55.529 --> 01:57.910
ELISE: You didn't ask
about the salmon though.

01:58.014 --> 01:59.153
BARBIE: Oh, the shade.

01:59.257 --> 02:04.158
NARRATOR: While the menwere on top of the world.

02:04.262 --> 02:05.677
MILLY: I get to ride in limos.

02:05.780 --> 02:07.644
I get to slide down skyscrapers.

02:07.748 --> 02:09.232
I get to eat at Wolfgang Puck.

02:09.336 --> 02:11.786
All-star season is great.

02:11.890 --> 02:12.856
NARRATOR: The next morning--

This year in Hell's Kitchenwe've gone up a notch.

02:19.760 --> 02:22.245
I'm going to be offering
a special bar menu.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.699
This is what your next
challenge is all about.

02:27.802 --> 02:32.911
The chef who creates the mostimmaculate the best bar menu

02:33.014 --> 02:38.019
item will be featured onthe Hell's Kitchen bar menu

02:38.123 --> 02:39.711
throughout this season.

02:39.814 --> 02:42.438
But that's not all, becausethis next bit is huge.

02:42.541 --> 02:44.198
The winning chef
for this challenge

02:44.302 --> 02:47.339
will be safe from
tonight's elimination.

02:47.443 --> 02:48.616
ROBYN: I need this
immunity, because I

02:48.720 --> 02:50.031
did not do good yesterday.

02:50.135 --> 02:52.758
Not only do I need it becauseI want to redeem myself,

02:52.862 --> 02:54.622
but I also want to
be safe tonight too.

02:54.726 --> 02:56.555
Make two plates,
because I'm going

02:56.659 --> 02:59.834
to have some incredible
help with the judging.

02:59.938 --> 03:03.355
How much time, Jared, wouldyou like for this challenge?

03:03.459 --> 03:06.669
45 minutes would be nice.

03:06.772 --> 03:08.809
You've got 40.

03:08.912 --> 03:10.362
And your time starts now.

03:10.466 --> 03:11.225
Let's go.

03:14.677 --> 03:17.576
[theme music]

03:49.159 --> 03:50.989
JARED: I'm trying to
make dumplings, chef.

03:51.092 --> 03:52.473
What kind of dumplings?

03:52.577 --> 03:54.751
I'm going to do
smoked halibut and pork.

03:54.855 --> 03:57.858
Theoretically, I'm feelingsuper confident in this dish.

03:57.961 --> 04:00.619
But the actuality
is it's starting

04:00.723 --> 04:02.828
to set in that I don't knowhow to make a fucking dumpling.

04:02.932 --> 04:04.623
Do you think eggs
will bind up my dough?

04:04.727 --> 04:05.590
Just [inaudible].

04:05.693 --> 04:06.729
I don't--

04:06.832 --> 04:07.626
I don't know.

04:07.730 --> 04:08.938
Heard that.

04:09.041 --> 04:10.215
What are you going
to make, Michelle?

04:10.319 --> 04:12.217
I'm making a shrimp
and lobster sausage.

04:12.321 --> 04:15.013
I'm definitely pushing thelimit of the definition

04:15.116 --> 04:16.256
of being ambitious.

04:16.359 --> 04:18.188
But this is Hell's Kitchen.

04:18.292 --> 04:20.984
It's go big or go home.

04:21.088 --> 04:23.090
I need three ounces of fat.

04:23.193 --> 04:24.712
Hey, individual challenge.

04:24.816 --> 04:26.680
This is going on the menu.

04:26.783 --> 04:27.991
MILLY: Here we go.

04:28.095 --> 04:30.546
It's a big difference betweenappetizers and bar food.

04:30.649 --> 04:32.789
I know how to create
high-end bar food.

04:32.893 --> 04:33.859
What're up to, Milly?

04:33.963 --> 04:35.344
MILLY: I'm gonna do
a seafood poutine.

04:35.447 --> 04:36.414
Yeah, chips and the gravy.

04:36.517 --> 04:37.760
Yes.

04:37.863 --> 04:40.210
I've just got to put my headdown and get this dish done.

04:40.314 --> 04:43.421
Because-- but time is chasingme down the street right now.

04:43.524 --> 04:45.699
[sighs] I almost
want to do wings.

04:45.802 --> 04:48.184
My wings are the perfect
tapas for a bar menu

04:48.288 --> 04:49.565
because you can pair
it with anything.

04:49.668 --> 04:50.842
You can have it with Chardonnay.

04:50.945 --> 04:52.499
You could have a
nice ale with it.

04:52.602 --> 04:54.224
You can also like
pop a shot with it.

04:54.328 --> 04:56.365
So, who doesn't
love chicken wings?

04:56.468 --> 04:58.608
[inhales] Woo!

04:58.712 --> 05:01.266
Chef Ramsay hits us with
a bar menu challenge.

05:01.370 --> 05:03.441
I'm like, yahtzee!

05:03.544 --> 05:05.546
I'm not a big fan of
vindication redemption,

05:05.650 --> 05:07.548
but you didn't like my
chicken yesterday, well,

05:07.652 --> 05:08.791
you're gonna like
my chicken today.

05:08.894 --> 05:10.171
Can I just get one
more little pinch.

05:10.275 --> 05:11.069
You could take 'em.
- I was--

05:11.172 --> 05:12.208
You can have them.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.451
GORDON RAMSEY: First
up, what's the sauce?

05:13.554 --> 05:15.625
Oh, this is a curry--
coconut curry, chef.

05:15.729 --> 05:16.523
It's delicious.

05:16.626 --> 05:18.594
Thank you, chef.

05:18.697 --> 05:19.836
Just under two
minutes, ladies.

05:19.940 --> 05:21.251
- Two minutes, heard.
- Two minutes, Chef.

05:21.355 --> 05:22.287
ROBYN: I feel a
little bit confident.

05:22.391 --> 05:23.253
Like, you know what?

05:23.357 --> 05:24.703
This crab cake
tastes really good.

05:24.807 --> 05:25.635
It's not dry.

05:25.739 --> 05:26.809
The romesco's good.

05:26.912 --> 05:30.847
I got this shit in the
bag, like dunk, whoosh!

05:30.951 --> 05:32.124
Nothing but net.

05:32.228 --> 05:33.747
Home run.

05:33.850 --> 05:36.232
GORDON RAMSEY: 15 seconds.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.129
Speed up, guys.

05:37.233 --> 05:38.027
Let's go.

05:38.130 --> 05:40.478
5, 4, 3--

05:40.581 --> 05:41.582
And I'm trying to be nice.

05:41.686 --> 05:42.825
Oh no, I appreciate it.

05:42.928 --> 05:44.551
GORDON RAMSEY: --2,
1, and serve, ladies.

05:44.654 --> 05:45.724
I don't believe
you got that done.

05:45.828 --> 05:46.622
Me neither.

05:46.725 --> 05:47.761
[laughter]

05:47.864 --> 05:50.039
Line up, please, let's go.

05:50.142 --> 05:54.215
I have two very important guestjudges that will be joining me.

05:54.319 --> 05:56.804
They look after 19
of my restaurants

05:56.908 --> 05:59.600
across three continents.

05:59.704 --> 06:02.327
Please welcome
Christina and Jocky.

06:02.431 --> 06:05.192
[applause]

06:06.227 --> 06:08.091
CONTESTANT: Oh, that's awesome.

06:08.195 --> 06:09.265
GORDON RAMSEY:
Christina and Jocky

06:09.369 --> 06:12.786
are going to sample everydish and then choose

06:12.889 --> 06:14.926
the top four from each kitchen.

06:15.029 --> 06:15.858
Is that clear?

06:15.961 --> 06:16.928
CONTESTANTS: Yes, chef.

06:17.031 --> 06:18.067
GORDON RAMSEY: OK,
great, Christina, Jocky.

06:18.170 --> 06:18.964
I'm relying on you guys.

06:19.068 --> 06:21.001
Please.

06:21.104 --> 06:24.004
DANA: I didn't just cook for40 minutes for Chef Ramsay

06:24.107 --> 06:25.592
to not even taste my dish.

06:25.695 --> 06:28.111
So I better be picked.

06:28.215 --> 06:29.423
CHRISTINA: OK, talk to me.

06:29.527 --> 06:33.151
OK, so I have a beer-batteredlobster tempura taco.

06:33.254 --> 06:36.154
On top you have a
roasted poblano salsa.

06:36.257 --> 06:37.707
Cool.You can take that with you.

06:37.811 --> 06:38.743
- Thank you.
- Chef.

06:38.846 --> 06:39.675
Ben.

06:39.778 --> 06:40.641
How are you, sir?

06:40.745 --> 06:42.885
So we have Asian
drumsticks marinated

06:42.988 --> 06:44.818
in a little bit of soy sauce.

06:44.921 --> 06:47.786
It's like the
ultimate chicken wing.

06:47.890 --> 06:49.201
OK.
Thank you.

06:49.305 --> 06:50.133
Yep.

06:50.237 --> 06:51.618
This is me in
a nutshell, chef.

06:51.721 --> 06:53.792
So I have a
Moroccan-style meatball.

06:53.896 --> 06:57.347
And like me, it's not
your average meatball.

06:57.451 --> 07:00.454
You know, it's got
a personality, so--

07:00.558 --> 07:01.938
[clears throat]

07:02.042 --> 07:02.836
Thank you.

07:02.939 --> 07:04.389
Thank you, chef.

07:04.493 --> 07:06.909
NARRATOR: While the blue teamjockeys for their sous chef's

07:07.012 --> 07:07.841
favor--

07:07.944 --> 07:09.325
She makes nervous, man.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.361
NARRATOR: --the red teamworries whether they can make it

07:11.465 --> 07:13.674
past the discerning
palate of chef

07:13.778 --> 07:16.297
and season 10 winner Christina.

07:16.401 --> 07:17.195
OK.

07:17.298 --> 07:19.473
I have mussels.

07:19.577 --> 07:22.303
Chef Christina is
so hard to read,

07:22.407 --> 07:26.618
but she is judging our stuff,so god, I hope she likes it.

07:26.722 --> 07:28.965
OK, thank you.

07:29.069 --> 07:31.934
She's not telling usanything about it anyways.

07:32.037 --> 07:35.662
I did a Asian dumpling
with smoked halibut.

07:35.765 --> 07:37.387
OK.

07:37.491 --> 07:38.630
JARED: Oh my god.

07:38.734 --> 07:40.045
Part of me is
wondering why I made

07:40.149 --> 07:41.357
dumplings today from scratch.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.876
I've never done that before.

07:42.979 --> 07:44.153
I didn't even know I knew how.

07:44.256 --> 07:47.467
It's like my mind's a separatefucking entity from me.

07:48.468 --> 07:49.469
Thank you.

07:49.572 --> 07:51.332
NARRATOR: The time has
come for Chef Ramsay

07:51.436 --> 07:53.265
to taste Christina
and Jocky's top

07:53.369 --> 07:55.405
four from each of their teams.

07:55.509 --> 07:58.132
He will then narrowed
down to his top four.

07:58.236 --> 08:00.687
And from that, he
will pick a winner.

08:00.790 --> 08:01.757
Christina.

08:01.860 --> 08:02.827
Yes, chef.

08:02.930 --> 08:05.485
GORDON RAMSEY: The
name of your first chef

08:05.588 --> 08:08.108
with an outstanding bar dish.

08:08.211 --> 08:10.351
It's going to be Dana
with her lobster taco.

08:10.455 --> 08:11.249
GORDON RAMSEY: Dana.

08:11.352 --> 08:12.699
CONSTANT: Yeah, Dana.

08:12.802 --> 08:13.769
Yeah!

08:13.872 --> 08:16.219
My taco, number one pick.

08:16.323 --> 08:19.395
What's up, ladies?

08:19.499 --> 08:20.672
Describe the dish, please.

08:20.776 --> 08:25.884
DANA: So I did a beer-batteredlobster tempura taco.

08:25.988 --> 08:28.128
I pan seared somechorizo in there as well.

08:28.231 --> 08:29.301
GORDON RAMSEY: Wow.

08:29.405 --> 08:30.579
I've never been a big
fan of fried lobster,

08:30.682 --> 08:32.235
but you've made that
tempura really light.

08:32.339 --> 08:34.824
Then the avocado crema just sortof makes it a little bit more

08:34.928 --> 08:36.274
royal.

08:36.377 --> 08:37.758
So far the dish to beat.

08:37.862 --> 08:38.656
Good job.

08:38.759 --> 08:39.553
Thank you, chef.

08:39.657 --> 08:40.589
[applause]

08:40.692 --> 08:41.866
Jocky.

08:41.969 --> 08:48.597
Whose dish from the bluekitchen will I be tasting first?

08:48.700 --> 08:51.185
JOCKY: The first dish, Gordon,will be Milly's, and it's

08:51.289 --> 08:52.946
a seafood poutine.

08:53.049 --> 08:53.947
Yes!

08:54.050 --> 08:55.396
It's me versus everybody.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.053
So let's do this!

08:57.157 --> 08:58.641
Describe the dish, please.

08:58.745 --> 09:01.092
Well, we have our
hand-cut French fries,

09:01.195 --> 09:06.580
fried and seasoned, and toppedwith a lobster cheese sauce.

09:06.684 --> 09:08.478
You think of poutine, it'snot the most elegant way

09:08.582 --> 09:10.239
to start the dinner.

09:10.342 --> 09:13.760
But this has to be the mostelegant fucking pot of poutine

09:13.863 --> 09:15.002
anywhere on the planet.
[laughter]

09:15.106 --> 09:16.176
MILLY: Yes, chef.

09:16.279 --> 09:18.143
GORDON RAMSEY: But is
it better than Dana's?

09:18.247 --> 09:21.422
[sighs] It's a tough one.

09:21.526 --> 09:22.320
DANA: This isn't fancy.

09:22.423 --> 09:23.735
That's just cheese fries.

09:23.839 --> 09:27.428
This is not gonna be betterthan my taco, that's for sure.

09:27.532 --> 09:29.396
It's better.

09:29.499 --> 09:32.192
Fuck.

09:32.295 --> 09:33.331
[sighs]
- Well done.

09:33.434 --> 09:34.228
Thank you, chef.

09:34.332 --> 09:35.264
Wow.

09:35.367 --> 09:36.161
Thank you, Milly.

09:36.265 --> 09:37.059
Head back.

09:37.162 --> 09:37.956
Wow.

chef, is Ashley.

09:46.965 --> 09:47.759
GORDON RAMSEY: Wow.

09:47.863 --> 09:48.726
Ashley, let's go.

09:48.829 --> 09:50.624
[applause]

09:50.728 --> 09:51.521
Thank you, Ashley.

09:51.625 --> 09:52.626
Describe the dish, please.

09:52.730 --> 09:54.766
What I have for
you is a polenta

09:54.870 --> 09:57.182
cake on the bottom
with tequila and

09:57.286 --> 10:00.185
lime cilantro marinated shrimp.

10:00.289 --> 10:01.186
Visually, it looks beautiful.

10:01.290 --> 10:02.360
Thank you, chef.

10:02.463 --> 10:04.362
I mean, it's gone above
and beyond a bar menu.

10:04.465 --> 10:05.984
But I mean, it's creative.

10:06.088 --> 10:07.710
Do you know what, Ashley?

10:07.814 --> 10:09.470
That is in my top four.

10:09.574 --> 10:10.368
Well done.

10:10.471 --> 10:11.472

10:13.371 --> 10:14.303

- Nice job, Ashely.

10:14.406 --> 10:15.200
GORDON RAMSEY: Right.

10:15.304 --> 10:16.167
Jocky.

10:16.270 --> 10:21.724
Gordon, the
second chef is Jared

10:21.828 --> 10:23.277
with his seafood dumplings.

10:23.381 --> 10:25.003
ASHLEY: Jared's dish is
going up against mine.

10:25.107 --> 10:26.280
Of course it is.

10:26.384 --> 10:29.042
They love putting us againsteach other around here.

10:29.145 --> 10:31.078
Seafood dumpling.

10:31.182 --> 10:32.424
Describe the dish, please.

10:32.528 --> 10:36.152
I have a dumpling stuffedwith pork and smoked halibut.

10:36.256 --> 10:37.257
GORDON RAMSEY:
That is delicious.

10:37.360 --> 10:41.054
But does it beat the
polenta and the poutine?

10:41.157 --> 10:43.021
Do you know what, Jared?

10:43.125 --> 10:46.956
It's on par in my top four.

10:47.060 --> 10:48.268
Thank you, chef.
GORDON RAMSEY: Wow.

10:48.371 --> 10:49.234
[applause]

10:49.338 --> 10:50.546
[giggles]

10:50.650 --> 10:51.443
Oh my god.

10:51.547 --> 10:52.790
I actually pulled this off.

10:52.893 --> 10:55.137
Guess who knows how
to make dumplings?

10:55.240 --> 10:57.070
GORDON RAMSEY: Christina, thethird chef from the red team.

10:57.173 --> 10:58.347
Who is it, please?

10:58.450 --> 11:03.145
CHRISTINA: Third chef, Ilike the lemon pepper wings

11:03.248 --> 11:04.422
by Elise.

11:04.525 --> 11:06.562
NARRATOR: It's Elise'sturn to try to make her way

11:06.666 --> 11:08.460
into Chef Ramsay's final four.

11:08.564 --> 11:09.841
Well.

11:09.945 --> 11:12.050
The wings that I made for youtoday are a Tuscan bar wing.

11:12.154 --> 11:14.190
It has Parmesan
cheese that also has

11:14.294 --> 11:15.122
the herbs of Provence on it.

11:15.226 --> 11:16.020
GORDON RAMSEY: Wow.

11:16.123 --> 11:16.952
They are delicious.

11:17.055 --> 11:17.849
Love the flavor.

11:17.953 --> 11:18.747
Love the crispiness.

11:18.850 --> 11:20.162
Brrr, it's a tough one.

11:20.265 --> 11:23.579
I'm gonna swap them out.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.513
And I'm gonna swap them
out with the shrimp.

11:26.616 --> 11:28.101
- Thank you, chef.
- Well done.

11:28.204 --> 11:29.033
Good job.

11:29.136 --> 11:30.897
ELISE: Thank you, chef.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.554
NARRATOR: With only three dishesleft to be called forward,

11:33.658 --> 11:35.349
Chef Jocky chooses--

11:35.453 --> 11:38.663
Gordon, my third chef isVan with this steak tacos.

11:38.767 --> 11:40.976
GORDON RAMSEY:
Wow, another taco.

11:41.079 --> 11:43.392
NARRATOR: Hoping Van's
carne asada tacos

11:43.495 --> 11:46.464
will be worthy of
the final four.

11:46.567 --> 11:47.603
The steak is
cooked beautifully.

11:47.707 --> 11:48.880
Crema, delicious.

11:48.984 --> 11:50.261
But they've gone above andbeyond with the mushrooms

11:50.364 --> 11:51.572
in there as well.

11:51.676 --> 11:53.920
Would I want to start offdinner with one of those?

11:54.023 --> 11:54.852
Yeah.

11:54.955 --> 11:56.370
I would.

11:56.474 --> 12:02.031
I'm gonna swap your tacosout with the dumpling.

12:02.135 --> 12:02.963
Good job.

12:03.067 --> 12:03.861
Thank you, chef.

12:03.964 --> 12:05.517
Wow.

12:05.621 --> 12:06.864
Um, Christina.

12:06.967 --> 12:11.661
I'm only going to taste onemore from the women's team.

12:11.765 --> 12:13.042
ROBYN: Please let my
dish be good enough.

12:13.146 --> 12:14.250
Please let my dish
be good enough.

12:14.354 --> 12:15.320
Please, please, please!

12:15.424 --> 12:16.943
This one was so hard, chef.

12:22.845 --> 12:26.055
[music playing]

12:28.644 --> 12:30.784
NARRATOR: In the first
ever bar menu challenge,

12:30.888 --> 12:33.856
it was up to the sous chefsto select four dishes each

12:33.960 --> 12:35.789
to be judged by Chef Ramsay.

12:35.893 --> 12:39.551
And Christina and Jocky areboth down to their final picks.

12:39.655 --> 12:40.863
Um, Christina, I'm
only going to taste

12:40.967 --> 12:43.901
one more from the women's team.

12:44.004 --> 12:45.592
This one was so hard, chef.

12:45.695 --> 12:48.595
Uh.

12:48.698 --> 12:51.771
I have to go with Michelle'slobster shrimp sausage.

12:51.874 --> 12:54.290
GORDON RAMSEY: Wow.

12:54.394 --> 12:55.533
OK.

12:55.636 --> 12:56.637
Describe the dish, please.

12:56.741 --> 12:58.847
OK so I have my take
on a lobster roll.

12:58.950 --> 13:02.782
I made a lobster shrimp sausagewith a little bit of Asian slaw

13:02.885 --> 13:03.921
on there.

13:04.024 --> 13:05.267
You know, when you
see a lobster roll

13:05.370 --> 13:07.925
and it's been steeped in butterand put together roughly,

13:08.028 --> 13:09.202
it's unappetizing.

13:09.305 --> 13:10.617
But they look beautiful.

13:10.720 --> 13:12.205
MICHELLE: Thank you.

13:12.308 --> 13:17.141
Michelle, that isdefinitely in my top four.

13:17.244 --> 13:18.073
Good job.

13:18.176 --> 13:18.970
Thank you, chef.

13:19.074 --> 13:21.283
Wow.

13:21.386 --> 13:23.492
Jocky, who was
the final chef you

13:23.595 --> 13:25.149
put forward from the blue team?

13:25.252 --> 13:32.294
Ooh, the last one will beNick and his crab fritters.

13:32.397 --> 13:33.191
BENJAMIN: I like my food.

13:33.295 --> 13:34.261
I think it's good.

13:34.365 --> 13:35.159
I was wrong.

13:38.093 --> 13:38.921
Uhh.

13:39.025 --> 13:39.819
Wow.

13:39.922 --> 13:41.165
Nick, describe the dish, please.

13:41.268 --> 13:44.893
Chef, you have crabfritters with a lemon chive

13:44.996 --> 13:48.103
mayo, bacon jam, with alittle chiffonade scallion.

13:48.206 --> 13:49.311
Presentation, beautiful.

13:49.414 --> 13:50.208
Let's get that right.

13:50.312 --> 13:52.038
Bacon jam on top, exquisite.

13:52.141 --> 13:55.593
The one issue I have with thoseare they're a touch doughy.

13:55.696 --> 13:57.388
It is definitely not inthe top four, I'm afraid.

13:57.491 --> 13:58.320
Thank you.

13:58.423 --> 14:00.563
OK, thank you, chef.

14:00.667 --> 14:02.462
We've narrowed the
pack down to four.

14:02.565 --> 14:05.672
I said only one of you willbe safe from elimination.

14:05.775 --> 14:07.708
MICHELLE: I'm hoping, hoping,hoping that Chef Ramsay's gonna

14:07.812 --> 14:10.401
pick my dish, because I reallywant to show Chef that I'm

14:10.504 --> 14:11.920
better than everyone here.

14:12.023 --> 14:16.062
The most outstanding bardish tonight belongs to--

14:16.165 --> 14:17.373
Chef Ramsay, call
my name, please.

14:20.169 --> 14:21.101
I'm feeling like I got.

14:21.205 --> 14:23.207
I'm feeling like
I might have it.

14:23.310 --> 14:25.174
I need to win this
because I remember

14:25.278 --> 14:28.868
season 9 first dinner service,and everyone was messing up.

14:28.971 --> 14:31.525
So that's a huge prize.

14:31.629 --> 14:32.423
GORDON RAMSEY: Damn.

14:32.526 --> 14:33.320
This is a tough one.

14:37.428 --> 14:38.222
Milly.

14:38.325 --> 14:39.154
Ah!

14:39.257 --> 14:41.052
[applause]

14:41.156 --> 14:42.191
Milly, well done.

14:42.295 --> 14:44.884
Your poutine goes
on tonight's menu.

14:44.987 --> 14:48.577
[grunts] First
individual competition.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.372
Little Milly, Baby Pepper.

14:50.475 --> 14:51.511
I just can't wait
to go tell them,

14:51.614 --> 14:53.858
like-- like your dad
came out number one.

14:53.962 --> 14:55.066
I really wanted to win.

14:55.170 --> 14:56.309
Me too.
But you know what?

14:56.412 --> 14:57.241
I'm happy for him.

14:57.344 --> 14:58.552
He did great.

14:58.656 --> 15:01.072
I know, but Milly alwaysfalls back on what he knows.

15:01.176 --> 15:03.143
He made a dish that
he's made 1,000 times.

15:03.247 --> 15:04.075
He won.

15:04.179 --> 15:05.456
MICHELLE: I know he won.

15:05.559 --> 15:07.492
If he's done it 1,000 timesand he can win with it, shit.

15:07.596 --> 15:08.873
[laughs]

15:13.188 --> 15:14.189
You OK, Ben?

15:14.292 --> 15:15.638
Your color's off.

15:15.742 --> 15:16.777
BEN: I'm all off.

15:16.881 --> 15:18.676
I'm about to go check
my sugar right now.

15:18.779 --> 15:21.023
Are you diabetic?

15:21.127 --> 15:22.714
BEN: Newly, so I'm up and down.

15:22.818 --> 15:23.784
Oh no.

15:23.888 --> 15:25.545
I feel like my
eyes are sinking in.

15:25.648 --> 15:26.546
I'm not feeling at all--

15:26.649 --> 15:27.685
Yeah, your--
your color's wacky.

15:27.788 --> 15:28.858
I'm gonna go check
my sugar, guys.

15:28.962 --> 15:31.585
I'll be back.

15:31.689 --> 15:34.519
It sucks that I'm not ashealthy as I'd like to be.

15:34.623 --> 15:37.246
But tonight I'll
give it 100%, and I'm

15:37.350 --> 15:39.248
not gonna make a spectacleby falling in the kitchen.

15:45.461 --> 15:46.738
CHRISTINA: Come on, guys.

15:46.842 --> 15:48.809
NARRATOR: As Ben
struggles to keep up--

15:48.913 --> 15:50.294

CHRISTINA: So Chef Ramsaywanted you to have your knife

15:55.851 --> 15:58.129

15:58.233 --> 16:00.925
You have Zwilling JAHenckels, really nice kits.

16:01.029 --> 16:02.685
So open up, and we've
got to get started.

16:02.789 --> 16:03.652

16:03.755 --> 16:05.309
CONTESTANT: Yeah, chef.
- Ooh, wow.

16:05.412 --> 16:07.863
I still use my knivesfrom when I was on before,

16:07.967 --> 16:09.140
and they are that quality.

16:09.244 --> 16:12.109
So pretty primo

16:12.212 --> 16:13.317

16:20.220 --> 16:22.015
This menu is bigger than it'sever been in this kitchen,

16:22.119 --> 16:22.912

16:23.016 --> 16:24.121
Yes, chef.

NICK: Right now everyone'skind of freaking out,

16:26.399 --> 16:27.400
but we're All Stars.

16:27.503 --> 16:29.885
Being able to adapt to
a new menu in a flash

16:29.989 --> 16:32.336
is super important to
becoming a head chef.

16:32.439 --> 16:33.578
JOCKY: Right.

16:33.682 --> 16:34.994
So we're going to startoff with the steak tartare.

16:35.097 --> 16:37.272
There's about three
ounces per portion.

16:37.375 --> 16:38.618
Pack it into the ring.

16:38.721 --> 16:40.861
CHRISTINA: Both cold saladsyou guys are plating fully.

16:40.965 --> 16:42.242
JOCKY: You have a
smoking machine here.

16:42.346 --> 16:43.485
Does everybody know
how to use this?

16:43.588 --> 16:44.589
Good.

16:44.693 --> 16:47.420
DANA: This is a lot
to learn in one day.

16:47.523 --> 16:51.424
I'm not gonna lie, I'mkind of shitting my pants.

16:51.527 --> 16:54.047
JOCKY: OK, salmon starter, rightdown the center of the plate,

16:54.151 --> 16:55.359

16:55.462 --> 16:58.500
We're going to do thescallops, a lamb, season,

16:58.603 --> 16:59.811
and then we've got a
little bit of duck.

16:59.915 --> 17:01.882
So duck you're gonna
score yourself.

17:01.986 --> 17:04.195
JOSH: I can't believe all theseproteins, all these dishes.

17:04.299 --> 17:05.196
This is All Stars.

17:05.300 --> 17:06.853
I did not expect a
walk in the park.

17:06.956 --> 17:08.475
I mean, and this is likea walk through the desert

17:08.579 --> 17:10.788
without water.

NARRATOR: With only 30 minutesuntil the doors open for dinner

to worry that he may not

17:16.518 --> 17:17.967
make it through the evening.

17:18.071 --> 17:19.797
So I-- I can't--

17:19.900 --> 17:21.488
I can't wrap my
head around it, man.

17:21.592 --> 17:22.662
I don't know if
it's stress-related.

17:22.765 --> 17:23.559
I don't know.

17:23.663 --> 17:24.802
But I'm just lethargic.

17:24.905 --> 17:27.908
And my eyes are
just blurry as shit.

17:28.012 --> 17:30.842
I-- it's like someone
threw sand in my eyes.

17:30.946 --> 17:33.811
Only one other time
has my vision become

17:33.914 --> 17:34.950
obscured like this.

17:35.054 --> 17:35.847
All right.

17:35.951 --> 17:37.401
And it did not end well.

17:37.504 --> 17:39.644
So I mean-- I want to give thiseverything that I've got, man.

17:39.748 --> 17:40.921
But I-- I'm not--
- Have a seat.

17:41.025 --> 17:41.819
I'll take your vitals.

17:41.922 --> 17:43.200
Yeah.

17:43.303 --> 17:45.754
10 years ago, season five,back in the day, I was young.

17:45.857 --> 17:46.651
I was healthy.

17:46.755 --> 17:49.033

nice, that risotto.

17:52.830 --> 17:55.488

has been extraordinary.

17:55.591 --> 17:56.937
BEN: I will cook
circles around you.

17:57.041 --> 17:58.698
I will circle you
like a [beep] moon.

17:58.801 --> 18:00.389
GORDON RAMSEY: You have anamazing amount of energy

18:00.493 --> 18:01.632
that any chef would love.

18:02.667 --> 18:04.497
Yes!

18:04.600 --> 18:07.224
You know, since then, Ihave had a pretty rough go.

18:07.327 --> 18:09.536
You know, this time,
I'm fat, and I'm old,

18:09.640 --> 18:13.506
and my diabetes andfucking eyes are terrible.

18:13.609 --> 18:15.128
Right now, I feel like
I want to go back.

18:15.232 --> 18:17.510
I want to go for it, but I'mafraid of getting into it

18:17.613 --> 18:19.546
and it becoming too much.

18:19.650 --> 18:21.997
I would prefer to spare
myself the moment of--

18:22.101 --> 18:23.826
of dropping in the kitchen.

18:23.930 --> 18:25.587
So I need to make a decisionwhether or not I'm gonna

18:25.690 --> 18:26.726
go for it or whether I tap out.

18:34.975 --> 18:37.185

Blood pressure's a tadhigh, but your other vitals

are all in good shape.

18:44.053 --> 18:45.227
BEN: On the books, I'm healthy.

18:45.331 --> 18:48.230
But this is not an idealsituation out here, and I'll--

18:48.334 --> 18:50.784

21:27.803 --> 21:30.944
I don't make carbonara everin my life, so like ever.

21:31.048 --> 21:33.775
I'm on hot apps, which
is my worst station.

21:33.878 --> 21:35.880
I don't do carbonaras back home.

21:35.984 --> 21:41.886
But it's not my menu, so I haveto suck it up and push through.

21:41.990 --> 21:42.784
Shit.

21:42.887 --> 21:43.819
That's too wet.

21:43.923 --> 21:44.751
I'm aware.

21:44.855 --> 21:45.959
That's why I'm fixing it.

21:46.063 --> 21:47.167
You're gonna break it.

21:47.271 --> 21:49.308
Would you just give
me a second please?

It's burst.

22:04.115 --> 22:05.220
It's broken.

Come on, ladies.

22:17.301 --> 22:19.338

22:19.441 --> 22:21.478
It's the most simplistic
dish on the menu.

22:21.581 --> 22:23.376
It's like cooking 101.

22:23.480 --> 22:24.412
Come on, Ashley.
Bounce back.

22:24.515 --> 22:25.309

I'm doing the very best thatI can to prove to Chef Ramsay I

22:46.848 --> 22:48.056

22:48.159 --> 22:49.264
And I'm not gonna
give Chef Ramsay

22:49.368 --> 22:50.783
anything but my
perfection, even if it

22:50.886 --> 22:52.198
takes a couple extra minutes.

22:52.301 --> 22:53.441

the shit with that?

All I'm thinking is justgive it everything I've got.

24:57.116 --> 24:58.945
Two minutes for garnishto go to the window, guys.

24:59.049 --> 25:00.153
Can we do that?
And we'll go in three.

25:03.225 --> 25:04.537
Ben?
- I'm sorry.

25:04.641 --> 25:06.297
I-- I clocked out for a minute.- What'd you say?

25:06.401 --> 25:07.471
- Yes, the answer is yes.- With me?

25:07.575 --> 25:08.023
Is this me?
- Yes.

25:08.127 --> 25:09.024
Yeah, I'm good.

25:09.128 --> 25:10.060
For me, it's a
little weird sharing

25:10.163 --> 25:11.337
the fish station with Ben.

25:11.440 --> 25:14.616
Ben's also not feeling well,so I'm a little nervous.

25:14.720 --> 25:15.686
But I got his back.

25:15.790 --> 25:16.687
I'll do whatever he needs.

25:16.791 --> 25:17.585
How long for the salmon?

25:17.688 --> 25:18.482
Salmon's ready.

25:18.586 --> 25:19.690
Go.

25:19.794 --> 25:20.622
Salmon, coming in.

25:20.726 --> 25:21.520
On your right, chef.

25:29.286 --> 25:32.979
Ben and Jared, come here.

25:33.083 --> 25:34.912
Ohh, what's gonna happen?

25:35.016 --> 25:36.327
Yeah, chef?

25:36.431 --> 25:38.329
The salmon's-- it's ice cold.

25:38.433 --> 25:39.503
It's not even
fucking [inaudible]..

25:39.607 --> 25:40.435
It's ice cold.

25:40.539 --> 25:41.954
How does that happen?

25:42.057 --> 25:45.785
It's just ice fucking cold.

25:45.889 --> 25:47.684
Who cooked that salmon?

25:47.787 --> 25:49.755
BEN: I did, chef.

25:49.858 --> 25:51.584
How thick is that salmon?

25:51.688 --> 25:52.758
Pretty thick, yeah.

25:52.861 --> 25:53.621
So what does that tell you?

25:53.724 --> 25:54.725
Come on.

25:54.829 --> 25:56.278
One more time, chef, heard.I screwed up.

25:56.382 --> 25:58.073
I think I just told Jaredto go to the window with it.

25:58.177 --> 25:59.696
You know, you just
recover from that.

25:59.799 --> 26:01.836

another salmon that's--

26:01.939 --> 26:04.424
You ready to go?

26:04.528 --> 26:05.356
30 seconds.

26:05.460 --> 26:06.461
If we give it
to him raw again,

26:06.565 --> 26:07.876
we're in a real shit storm.

26:07.980 --> 26:09.568

How long for the salmon?

26:43.118 --> 26:43.912

26:44.016 --> 26:44.982
Yep, let's go.

26:45.086 --> 26:46.225

Elise, can I
slice my wellington?

27:15.150 --> 27:16.427
Yes.

27:16.531 --> 27:18.982
If we can keep the momentumthat we have now with entrees

27:19.085 --> 27:21.881

Ah, fuck me.

Ah.

27:40.106 --> 27:42.833

Look at the color of that.

27:45.318 --> 27:46.319
It's not even resting.

27:46.423 --> 27:49.081
It's still white.

27:49.184 --> 27:51.359
Can you get your shit together?

27:51.462 --> 27:52.429

27:55.052 --> 27:56.536
ELISE: I will bounce
back from this.

27:56.640 --> 27:58.193
I'm going to take
this and learn.

27:58.297 --> 28:00.023
I'm the bounce back queen.

28:00.126 --> 28:02.611
I'm not rushing anything
ever again, ever.

28:02.715 --> 28:04.821
Five minutes out,

28:14.554 --> 28:17.005
Tonight I'm on the
dreaded meat station,

28:17.109 --> 28:23.771
and I was eliminated on season14 because of the meat station.

28:23.874 --> 28:25.462
It's like a traffic light.

28:25.565 --> 28:26.566
So that is raw.

28:26.670 --> 28:27.498
Where can I grab
more wellingtons, chef?

28:27.602 --> 28:28.914
We can't just
wave a magic wand.

28:29.017 --> 28:31.502
We have no more wellington.

28:31.606 --> 28:33.263
Wellingtons,

29:22.070 --> 29:26.488
This is what I call a disaster.

29:26.592 --> 29:30.492
Look at that, overcooked.

29:30.596 --> 29:33.806
Take these to those

wished the floor would

29:36.222 --> 29:38.328

29:43.471 --> 29:46.129
can't cook a fucking steak.

29:46.232 --> 29:47.544
I'm sorry.

29:47.647 --> 29:49.718
It's all my fault. I apologizethat you're waiting so long,

32:38.301 --> 32:39.785
He is not gonna be happy.

32:39.888 --> 32:41.200
I'm getting fucking pissed!

32:41.304 --> 32:42.753
Look, if you just
give me a few minutes

32:42.857 --> 32:45.377
and back up off of me,
I can get this done.

32:45.480 --> 32:46.688
Where is the salmon?

32:46.792 --> 32:47.966
MANDA: I'm working on it, chef!

32:48.069 --> 32:49.588
That's raw.
Where's the salmon?

32:49.691 --> 32:50.382
- I--
- It's burnt, chef.

32:50.485 --> 32:51.038
On the--
- Burnt?

32:51.141 --> 32:51.900
The skin's burnt.

32:52.004 --> 32:52.798
Yes, the skin was burnt.

32:52.901 --> 32:54.455
GORDON RAMSEY: Bring it here!

32:54.558 --> 32:55.352
Hot.

32:55.456 --> 32:56.767
Shit!

32:56.871 --> 32:57.665
Come here.

32:57.768 --> 32:58.562
Hey.

32:58.666 --> 32:59.598
Oh no, oh no!

32:59.701 --> 33:01.255
Hey, look at where we are.

33:04.016 --> 33:05.569
All Stars?

33:05.673 --> 33:09.884
Let's get one thing
right, no stars.

33:09.988 --> 33:11.920
All of you, get out.

33:12.024 --> 33:12.818
Fuck!

33:17.788 --> 33:18.686
Oh shit!

33:22.690 --> 33:23.656
It's like fucking jerky.

33:23.760 --> 33:24.899
[laughs]

33:25.003 --> 33:26.487
Jordin, I am so sorry.

33:29.731 --> 33:31.699
Luckily we had the blue side.

33:31.802 --> 33:32.976
Here's to us.

33:33.080 --> 33:34.081
God.

33:34.184 --> 33:35.496
NARRATOR: While the
women All Stars trudge

33:35.599 --> 33:38.085
back to the dorms inshame, the men All Stars--

33:38.188 --> 33:39.362
Last table, blue team, yes?

33:39.465 --> 33:40.811
- Oui, chef.
- Let's drive.

33:40.915 --> 33:41.881
Let's go.
Come on.

33:41.985 --> 33:43.814
NARRATOR: --are on
their way to completing

33:43.918 --> 33:46.438
the best opening night inHell's Kitchen history.

33:46.541 --> 33:47.611
Walking halibut.

33:47.715 --> 33:49.303
- Chef, chicken.
- Very nice.

33:49.406 --> 33:50.200
Service, please.

33:50.304 --> 33:51.236
Let's go.

33:51.339 --> 33:54.308
Blue team, rock it out, baby!

33:54.411 --> 33:55.343
Woo!

33:55.447 --> 33:56.793
Mm.

33:56.896 --> 33:57.863
Yeah, this looks really good.

33:57.966 --> 33:58.864
Clear done, yes?

33:58.967 --> 33:59.761
Yes, chef.

34:02.937 --> 34:03.731
Breathe.

34:06.527 --> 34:07.735
I deserve to be nominated.

34:07.838 --> 34:09.254
[sniffs]

34:09.357 --> 34:11.118
I don't think that
you deserve to go home.

34:11.221 --> 34:12.119
[sniffs]

34:12.222 --> 34:13.948
I think that you
have more to show.

34:14.052 --> 34:15.846
And you've got to go up there,and you've gotta be strong.

34:19.057 --> 34:22.094
I've gotta get
my shit together.

34:22.198 --> 34:24.234
I'm gonna do what I can
to get her out of this,

34:24.338 --> 34:26.892
because Elise is a strong chef.

34:26.995 --> 34:29.308
As long as she's
in it, we're in it.

34:29.412 --> 34:31.103
There was a communicationmeltdown from the beginning,

34:31.207 --> 34:33.519
and it started with hot apps.

34:33.623 --> 34:36.833
I had a fumble today, andit's not gonna happen again.

34:36.936 --> 34:39.732
It took me a minute, but Ifeel like I bounced back.

34:39.836 --> 34:42.287
I don't think I
deserve to go up.

34:42.390 --> 34:44.358
Ashley should go home becauseshe totally screwed that

34:44.461 --> 34:45.669
app station from the get-go.

34:45.773 --> 34:48.224
Carbonara should be
muscle memory by now.

34:48.327 --> 34:49.846
Listen, I bounced
back, period.

34:49.949 --> 34:51.054
Period, I did.

34:51.158 --> 34:52.607
And I was trying myhardest to help everyone.

34:52.711 --> 34:56.577
I was trying my
absolute hardest.

34:56.680 --> 34:58.958
OK, next was me.

34:59.062 --> 35:00.270
You were on wellingtons.

35:00.374 --> 35:01.513
You were on strip, obviously.

35:01.616 --> 35:02.617
And chicken.

35:02.721 --> 35:05.586
She was on strip,
duck, chicken, and lamb.

35:05.689 --> 35:07.588
I was on the wellingtons, andI was gonna do the sauces,

35:07.691 --> 35:09.141
and we were gonna help
each other [inaudible]..

35:09.245 --> 35:11.730
She had four proteins,
and she had two.

35:11.833 --> 35:13.559
[laughs] Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:13.663 --> 35:15.803
Let's back up before
Barbie even say, well,

35:15.906 --> 35:17.770
you only had two proteins.

35:17.874 --> 35:19.703
Me and Elise already decidedthat we were not gonna fight,

35:19.807 --> 35:21.084
and we were gonna work
together as a team.

35:21.188 --> 35:22.327
And she wanted to
cook the meats,

35:22.430 --> 35:23.466
and I said I'll do
the wellingtons.

35:23.569 --> 35:24.846
I mean--

35:24.950 --> 35:28.609
There's definitely an alliancebetween Barbie and Elise.

35:28.712 --> 35:29.920
It's already there.

35:30.024 --> 35:33.131
Elise did communicate
on that first New York.

35:33.234 --> 35:34.408
There was communication.

35:34.511 --> 35:37.204
I was thrown off from
the beginning with time,

35:37.307 --> 35:38.550
because we're dragging on apps.

35:38.653 --> 35:39.827
And then I'm feeling
bad for them,

35:39.930 --> 35:41.656
so I'm trying to help thembecause everybody else is

35:41.760 --> 35:44.211
preoccupied with their station.

35:44.314 --> 35:46.005
The last ticket
was, what, two salmon?

35:46.109 --> 35:47.628
It was the one salmon
that couldn't get out.

35:47.731 --> 35:48.560
And that was me.

35:48.663 --> 35:49.975
The salmon was me.

35:50.078 --> 35:51.908
I tripped up on
one ticket, like.

35:52.011 --> 35:54.082
One ticket that you had todo like three different times.

35:54.186 --> 35:55.153
I understand that.

35:55.256 --> 35:56.740
Everything else I
sent out was perfect.

35:56.844 --> 35:58.156
But, OK--MANDA: Every single time.

35:58.259 --> 35:59.847
Even Chef was like,
oh, these are perfect.

35:59.950 --> 36:01.193
Aye, aye, aye.

36:01.297 --> 36:03.057
Manda, you didn't bounceback, and we got kicked out.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.093
This is just bullshit,
like I'm gonna go home

36:05.197 --> 36:06.681
on a fucking piece of salmon.

36:06.785 --> 36:10.133
It was one ticket, one
ticket that I screwed.

36:10.237 --> 36:12.756
I'm not gonna let one
mistake send me home.

36:12.860 --> 36:14.137
So aggravating.

36:14.241 --> 36:15.138
Um.

36:15.242 --> 36:16.035
I don't know.

36:18.314 --> 36:19.729
You guys can't even
fucking make a decision.

36:32.362 --> 36:35.538
I figured that I was gonnahave a true all-star service.

36:35.641 --> 36:38.472
What I got was All
Stars on the blue side

36:38.575 --> 36:42.717
and no real stars
on the red sides.

36:42.821 --> 36:45.513
Bobby, red team's first
nomination and why.

36:45.617 --> 36:50.173
Our first nomination
for the night was Elise.

36:50.277 --> 36:51.070
Elise.

36:51.174 --> 36:52.210
BARBIE: Yes, chef.

36:52.313 --> 36:56.938
Elise lost it on
meat station, and she

36:57.042 --> 36:59.907
never really got it back.

37:00.010 --> 37:02.737
Red team's second
nomination and why.

37:02.841 --> 37:05.153
Chef, our second nominationfor the night was--

37:13.990 --> 37:16.786
[music playing]

37:19.375 --> 37:21.515
NARRATOR: After adisappointing opening night

37:21.618 --> 37:23.482
where they were kicked
out of the kitchen--

37:23.586 --> 37:24.828
GORDON RAMSEY: What a night.

37:24.932 --> 37:26.796
NARRATOR: --the red team AllStars were asked to nominate

37:26.899 --> 37:29.177
two chefs for elimination.

37:29.281 --> 37:30.248
The first was--

37:30.351 --> 37:32.767
Elise.

37:32.871 --> 37:35.460
GORDON RAMSEY: Red team'ssecond nomination and why.

37:35.563 --> 37:42.674
Chef, our second nominationfor the night was Manda.

37:42.777 --> 37:43.640
Wow.

37:43.744 --> 37:46.954
--based on her
refire of the salmon

37:47.057 --> 37:49.784
and a little bit ofstruggling through the night.

37:49.888 --> 37:53.305
GORDON RAMSEY: A little bit ofstruggling through the night.

37:53.409 --> 37:55.238
Elise, Manda, step forward.

37:57.930 --> 38:00.657
Let's cut straight to the point.

38:00.761 --> 38:03.867
Manda, tell me why you think youshould stay in Hell's Kitchen.

38:03.971 --> 38:05.800
Every single thing
that you criticized me

38:05.904 --> 38:10.218
for last time I was here, Iworked on and I improved on.

38:10.322 --> 38:12.290
Last time my communicationwas a big problem,

38:12.393 --> 38:13.912
and I communicated
all night long.

38:14.015 --> 38:15.293
Everything that I
sent out tonight

38:15.396 --> 38:18.675
up until that last
ticket was perfect.

38:18.779 --> 38:19.780
My pans were too hot.

38:19.883 --> 38:20.988
I know it.

38:21.091 --> 38:23.577
I just got flustered, andI let that last ticket

38:23.680 --> 38:25.510
get the best of me.

38:25.613 --> 38:27.063
Elise.

38:27.166 --> 38:28.996
Tell me why you think youshould stay in Hell's Kitchen.

38:29.099 --> 38:31.101
I'm not the weakest
member of the red team.

38:31.205 --> 38:32.758
Meat is usually my strength.

38:32.862 --> 38:34.864
I'm not gonna sit here andmake excuses, say who didn't

38:34.967 --> 38:36.486
help me, or who I was helping.

38:36.590 --> 38:38.626
I'm gonna say that ifI'm given the opportunity

38:38.730 --> 38:40.179
that I will do better.

38:40.283 --> 38:42.009
I had to get Giovanni
from the blue team

38:42.112 --> 38:44.736
to come over and coach
you on how to cook.

38:44.839 --> 38:48.360
And that's the most
embarrassing part, chef.

38:48.464 --> 38:49.257
Jennifer.

38:49.361 --> 38:50.328
Yes, chef.

38:50.431 --> 38:52.778
If you were to send
one individual home,

38:52.882 --> 38:54.124
who would it be?

38:54.228 --> 38:55.781
Elise is better chef.

38:55.885 --> 38:58.474
I would send home Manda.

38:58.577 --> 38:59.509
Barbie.

38:59.613 --> 39:00.683
Chef, I was sent home Manda.

39:00.786 --> 39:01.684
GORDON RAMSEY: Dana.

39:01.787 --> 39:03.306
I'm gonna say Elise.

39:03.410 --> 39:04.928
GORDON RAMSEY: Ashley.
- Amanda.

39:05.032 --> 39:05.826
GORDON RAMSEY: Michelle.

39:05.929 --> 39:07.103
Amanda.

39:07.206 --> 39:08.207
GORDON RAMSEY: Robyn.

39:08.311 --> 39:12.833
Based on tonight's
performance, Elise.

39:12.936 --> 39:14.559
It's Because, I'm
a threat to her.

39:14.662 --> 39:17.182
That's why.

39:17.285 --> 39:18.528
This is hard.

39:18.632 --> 39:19.495
We raised the bar.

39:19.598 --> 39:21.289
You guys are the
best of the best.

39:21.393 --> 39:23.740
I brought you back for a reason.

39:23.844 --> 39:25.604
Hell's Kitchen is not a sprint.

39:25.708 --> 39:26.812
It's a marathon.

39:26.916 --> 39:30.402
I need a chef that isdurable, is a fighter, who

39:30.506 --> 39:33.301
can bounce back from anything.

39:33.405 --> 39:40.619
My decision is [exhales] Ben.

39:44.105 --> 39:45.521
Get up here.

39:45.624 --> 39:47.419
You two, back in line.

39:47.523 --> 39:48.316
Ben?

39:50.940 --> 39:52.700
Oh my god.

39:52.804 --> 39:56.152
Young man, I haven't
taken my eyes off you

39:56.255 --> 39:58.292
since you arrived
in Hell's Kitchen,

39:58.396 --> 40:00.501
and I don't think you
can go the distance.

40:03.090 --> 40:03.884
Give me your jacket.

40:07.715 --> 40:08.509
Bye, Ben.

40:08.613 --> 40:09.407
CONTESTANT: Bye, Ben.

40:09.510 --> 40:10.718
Bye, Ben.

40:10.822 --> 40:11.995
Thank you.

40:12.099 --> 40:13.721
Sorry.

40:13.825 --> 40:14.722
CONTESTANT: See you later, Ben

40:14.826 --> 40:15.689
Bye, guys.

40:15.792 --> 40:16.586
Good luck.

40:20.935 --> 40:22.627
I knew it was
gonna be difficult.

40:22.730 --> 40:23.697
It's an All Star season.

40:23.800 --> 40:25.388
You've got a lot of
real hungry chefs,

40:25.492 --> 40:28.253
and clearly I'm not
quite as active as maybe

40:28.356 --> 40:30.117
I was, you know, 10 years ago.

40:30.220 --> 40:31.429
I gave it everything I had.

40:31.532 --> 40:32.947
So no regrets whatsoever.

40:33.051 --> 40:36.468
I'm-- I think Chef Ramsaymade the right decision.

40:36.572 --> 40:38.090
Now, get out of here.

40:38.194 --> 40:40.438
"Hell's Kitchen All
Stars" is definitely

40:40.541 --> 40:41.922
not for the faint of heart.- [sighs]

40:42.025 --> 40:44.269
We need to work together, andif there's somebody on our team

40:44.372 --> 40:47.686
that isn't working as a teammember, they've got to go.

40:47.790 --> 40:50.033
I'm here to stay.

40:50.137 --> 40:52.139
What the fuck just happened?

40:52.242 --> 40:53.071
Let's be honest.

40:53.174 --> 40:54.210
The red team lost.

40:54.313 --> 40:56.695
One of those bitches
should have gone home.

40:56.799 --> 40:57.593
GORDON RAMSEY: Big Ben?

40:57.696 --> 40:59.422
More like big liability.

40:59.526 --> 41:01.804
He clearly wasn't going
to be able to keep up.

41:01.907 --> 41:03.357
So I had to let him down.

41:14.092 --> 41:14.920
You know what?

41:15.024 --> 41:16.612
This type of shit motivates me.

41:16.715 --> 41:18.959
I know I'm in the top four ofthe chefs on the women's team.

41:19.062 --> 41:20.443
I know that for a fact.

41:20.547 --> 41:22.549
OK, why you getting
attitude with me?

41:22.652 --> 41:23.757
I'm not getting attitude.

41:23.860 --> 41:24.999
I'm just telling you.

41:25.103 --> 41:26.898
I know I'm not the weakestlink on the red team.

41:27.001 --> 41:28.727
And if you try to
eliminate me, I'm

41:28.831 --> 41:31.005
gonna take that and fuelthat to be better than you

41:31.109 --> 41:32.386
every single challenge,
be better than you

41:32.490 --> 41:33.525
at dinner service,
and that's just

41:33.629 --> 41:34.906
the type of competitor I am.

41:35.009 --> 41:36.666
Can I speak to you just
one-on-one, no bullshit.

41:36.770 --> 41:37.702
Why?

41:37.805 --> 41:38.944
I just want to talk
to you one-on-one,

41:39.048 --> 41:41.119

41:41.222 --> 41:42.707
I felt like it wasn't
a team, you and I.

41:42.810 --> 41:44.156
You felt like it
wasn't a team at first,

41:44.260 --> 41:45.295
but I had four proteins.
- All right, you guys.

41:45.399 --> 41:46.538
And all you had to do
was time wellingtons.

three fucking lambs,

41:52.510 --> 41:53.545

41:54.822 --> 41:55.616
