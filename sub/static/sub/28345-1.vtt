01:25.512 --> 01:28.146
And just have fun!

01:28.182 --> 01:31.650
There are no rights
or wrongs in art.

01:31.685 --> 01:35.720
There are no mistakes,
there's no end goal,

01:35.756 --> 01:39.491
or perfect finished product.

01:39.526 --> 01:40.725
What we're trying to do here

01:40.761 --> 01:44.796
is just take what's in your
heart and put it on the canvas.

01:44.832 --> 01:45.964
Miss Jamie?

01:45.999 --> 01:47.199
Yes, Lizzie?

01:47.234 --> 01:49.301
How do we know
what's in our hearts?

01:49.336 --> 01:53.538
Well, we don't always know.

01:53.574 --> 01:56.675
But that's why we're here,
right?

01:56.710 --> 01:58.243
To figure it out.

01:58.278 --> 02:00.178
'Kay.

02:05.319 --> 02:06.685
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

02:06.720 --> 02:07.986
Excuse me, my fault.

02:08.020 --> 02:08.987
My fault.

02:09.021 --> 02:10.955
Thanks.

02:20.033 --> 02:23.101
So.
What do you think?

02:23.136 --> 02:24.936
I think it's amazing.

02:24.972 --> 02:26.905
We could build out
multiple rooms,

02:26.940 --> 02:31.276
we could do reception, a gallery
so we could have art shows

02:31.311 --> 02:32.644
and community events.

02:32.679 --> 02:35.213
I mean, I think it's perfect.

02:35.249 --> 02:36.689
And this is just
our second location.

02:36.717 --> 02:39.417
Wait till you see what I've
planned for our third and fourth.

02:40.354 --> 02:42.053
- You're so excited.
- I am.

02:42.089 --> 02:43.188
It's what I love to do.

02:43.223 --> 02:45.156
I've spent my life
building businesses,

02:45.192 --> 02:47.592
and we all know this past
year of retirement

02:47.628 --> 02:48.994
has been hard on me.

02:49.229 --> 02:50.295
Hard on all of us.

02:51.331 --> 02:52.630
This is a dream come true.

02:52.666 --> 02:54.733
Jamie needs help expanding
Canvas Creations,

02:54.768 --> 02:56.634
and I need to be working again,

02:56.670 --> 02:58.770
and you get me out of the house.

02:58.805 --> 02:59.704
Okay?

02:59.740 --> 03:01.372
Yes.

03:01.408 --> 03:03.208
How do we make this a reality?

03:03.243 --> 03:05.276
Let's talk terms.

03:05.312 --> 03:07.545
Okay.

03:13.386 --> 03:15.286
Thank you.

03:15.956 --> 03:19.824
Have I told you in the last five
minutes how much I love you?

03:19.860 --> 03:22.961
No, not in the last
five minutes.

03:23.630 --> 03:26.031
- Should I come back later?
- No, we'll stop.

03:27.300 --> 03:29.234
It's not our fault,
spring is in the air.

03:29.269 --> 03:30.613
Yeah, which would be
a great excuse,

03:30.637 --> 03:32.470
except you guys were
like this last winter,

03:32.506 --> 03:34.639
and summer, and fall.

03:34.674 --> 03:36.040
I gotta go.

03:36.076 --> 03:37.876
Sugar?

03:40.781 --> 03:42.781
- Bye.
- Bye.

03:42.816 --> 03:45.617
You two are cute.

03:46.686 --> 03:47.786
Here you go.

03:47.821 --> 03:48.787
Thanks.

03:48.822 --> 03:52.724
Well, maybe it's time
to start dating again?

03:52.759 --> 03:56.294
I mean, it's been a year.

03:56.329 --> 03:57.128
Oh, what?

03:57.164 --> 04:00.665
- Please, just change the subject.
- Change the subject?

04:00.700 --> 04:02.534
All right, speaking of
subject change...

04:03.904 --> 04:06.938
I just toured a space
that would be perfect

04:06.973 --> 04:08.840
for the second Canvas Creations.

04:08.875 --> 04:10.742
That's great, but.

04:10.777 --> 04:12.588
Canvas Creations was supposed
to be the thing you did

04:12.612 --> 04:13.778
on the side of painting,

04:13.814 --> 04:17.214
and if you expand, you're not
gonna have time to paint,

04:17.250 --> 04:20.151
or submit to showcases
and exhibitions.

04:20.187 --> 04:21.452
Which brings me

04:21.488 --> 04:22.320
to my exciting news.

04:22.355 --> 04:23.888
I just learned that
with three weeks

04:23.924 --> 04:25.557
till the Cherry Blossom
Arts Festival,

04:25.592 --> 04:28.226
the festival lost its usual
venue of The Windsor Manor,

04:28.261 --> 04:30.428
and is switching
to the Botanical Gardens.

04:30.463 --> 04:32.297
That is very exciting.

04:32.332 --> 04:35.466
Which means that as head
and sole employee

04:35.502 --> 04:37.302
of the special events
permitting office,

04:37.337 --> 04:39.304
I'm gonna be working directly
with the organizers

04:39.339 --> 04:41.105
of the arts festival.

04:41.141 --> 04:43.608
I could put in a good word
for you.

04:43.643 --> 04:46.711
For your submission for
the emerging artist showcase.

04:46.746 --> 04:47.779
That's very sweet.

04:47.814 --> 04:51.749
And I do appreciate
your meddling.

04:51.785 --> 04:53.618
But I didn't submit.

04:53.653 --> 04:54.619
What?

04:54.654 --> 04:55.854
Why not?

04:55.889 --> 04:58.656
Because I'm not painting, and
I haven't been in almost a year.

04:58.692 --> 05:00.625
And even if I was painting,
every year I submit

05:00.660 --> 05:02.160
to the festival
and get rejected.

05:02.195 --> 05:04.295
I know it's hard, but
you have to keep trying.

05:04.331 --> 05:05.230
You can't give up.

05:05.265 --> 05:06.497
I don't want to.

05:06.533 --> 05:11.402
But every year, I watch another
artist win the festival's prize,

05:11.438 --> 05:15.106
a solo show in Paris.

05:15.141 --> 05:16.708
My dream.

05:16.743 --> 05:17.942
And I'm happy for them,

05:17.978 --> 05:19.143
I... I mean, I really am.

05:19.179 --> 05:21.212
It's just, it's starting
to feel like

05:21.248 --> 05:24.415
it's never gonna happen for me.

05:24.451 --> 05:26.451
And this is my dream.

05:26.486 --> 05:32.123
I don't know how to make it
more than a dream.

05:32.158 --> 05:33.791
I've got an idea.

05:33.827 --> 05:35.660
Come.

05:38.665 --> 05:39.665
I'm back!

05:40.700 --> 05:42.578
Not that I'm complaining,
'cause this is literally

05:42.602 --> 05:47.005
my favourite place on earth,
but what are we doing here?

05:47.040 --> 05:48.840
We are getting you supplies.

05:48.875 --> 05:51.075
For what, exactly?

05:51.111 --> 05:53.778
I think I already own almost
everything in the store.

05:53.813 --> 05:56.047
You don't have poster board.

05:56.082 --> 05:57.293
And why do I need poster board?

05:57.317 --> 06:00.285
For my sixth grade
science project?

06:00.320 --> 06:02.632
Remember four years ago when
I went through that rough patch

06:02.656 --> 06:05.356
and I hated my job working
for the event planner,

06:05.392 --> 06:07.992
and had no luck dating?

06:08.028 --> 06:10.528
I remember a lot of ice cream
sundae pity parties.

06:10.563 --> 06:11.663
They were delicious.

06:12.832 --> 06:15.633
And then, I heard about that job
at the special events

06:15.669 --> 06:18.937
permitting office, my dream job,
and then I got it,

06:18.972 --> 06:21.172
and then about a month later,
I met Tom.

06:21.207 --> 06:23.841
And I'm happy for you, but
I'm just a little confused.

06:23.877 --> 06:25.877
How's that relate
to poster board?

06:25.912 --> 06:28.980
It wasn't luck,
it wasn't destiny.

06:29.015 --> 06:31.282
I made it happen with...

06:31.318 --> 06:32.318
No...

06:32.352 --> 06:33.952
- A vision board.
- A vision board?

06:33.987 --> 06:37.622
I made that vision board, and
then all my dreams came true.

06:37.657 --> 06:39.791
They came true because
you took action

06:39.826 --> 06:41.492
and went after what you wanted.

06:41.528 --> 06:42.860
Not because you collaged.

06:42.896 --> 06:44.562
I took action because
my vision board

06:44.597 --> 06:46.597
helped me realize what I wanted.

06:46.633 --> 06:48.433
Ava.

06:48.468 --> 06:49.468
No.

06:49.502 --> 06:50.535
Jamie.

06:50.570 --> 06:51.781
As an artist, I'm sure
you'll agree

06:51.805 --> 06:53.604
that images are very powerful,

06:53.640 --> 06:55.707
and when you have a clear vision
of what you want,

06:55.742 --> 06:58.409
you'll find a clear path
to achieving it.

06:58.445 --> 06:59.911
Besides, what have
you got to lose?

06:59.946 --> 07:01.179
My artistic dignity.

07:01.214 --> 07:02.447
We'll take everything.

07:02.482 --> 07:03.681
We're not taking any of it.

07:03.717 --> 07:04.782
This too.

07:04.818 --> 07:05.850
No need to thank me.

07:05.885 --> 07:07.418
I wasn't going to.

07:09.055 --> 07:11.067
If you're walking me home to get
those collaging supplies

07:11.091 --> 07:12.190
in my door...

07:12.225 --> 07:14.003
Actually, there's another reason
I'm walking you home,

07:14.027 --> 07:16.227
and I'm sorry I waited
until now to bring it up.

07:16.262 --> 07:18.496
You finally
rented out your unit.

07:18.531 --> 07:20.431
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

07:20.467 --> 07:22.967
I know it's sudden, but it kinda
just happened overnight.

07:23.003 --> 07:23.968
Hey, neighbour.

07:24.004 --> 07:27.271
Please tell me your brother
is not my new...

07:27.307 --> 07:29.273
I'm sorry.
I know Max drives you crazy.

07:29.309 --> 07:32.110
He doesn't drive me crazy.

07:32.145 --> 07:33.911
Okay yeah, he drives me crazy.

07:33.947 --> 07:36.714
But you know how much trouble
I was having finding a sublet.

07:36.750 --> 07:37.960
And he never stays anywhere
for long.

07:37.984 --> 07:39.417
He'll be gone
before you know it.

07:39.452 --> 07:41.252
Promise?

07:41.287 --> 07:43.087
Hey.

07:45.191 --> 07:47.191
Hey.

07:48.428 --> 07:50.028
Okay.

07:51.231 --> 07:53.642
- So, I thought you were in San Diego.
- That was last spring.

07:53.666 --> 07:55.400
I was in Tucson, and then Boise,

07:55.435 --> 07:57.235
and then Ava mentioned
a temp job back here,

07:57.270 --> 07:58.803
and I thought "why not?"

07:58.838 --> 08:01.339
Max got a job as a
landscape architect.

08:01.374 --> 08:02.473
Groundskeeper.

08:02.509 --> 08:04.220
You got a master's degree
in landscape architecture

08:04.244 --> 08:07.445
to then work as a groundskeeper
at the botanical gardens?

08:07.480 --> 08:10.515
Where Jamie might be displaying
her work next month

08:10.550 --> 08:12.517
at the Cherry Blossom
Arts Festival.

08:12.552 --> 08:13.684
If she vision boards.

08:13.720 --> 08:18.022
Not only will I see you at the gardens,
but I will see you at home, too.

08:18.058 --> 08:19.290
Would you believe it?

08:19.325 --> 08:21.771
Great big world, and we end up
living right next to each other.

08:21.795 --> 08:24.462
I really can't believe it...

08:24.497 --> 08:25.430
Okay.

08:25.465 --> 08:28.032
Who knows, maybe you'll even
like having him as your neighbour.

08:28.068 --> 08:30.579
And if achieving your dreams isn't
reason enough to vision board,

08:30.603 --> 08:33.938
you can always collage
a picture of Max moving away.

08:33.972 --> 08:36.174
Well, that's reason enough
for me.

08:36.208 --> 08:37.442
You need help with those?

08:37.477 --> 08:39.243
You know what,
this is the last of it.

08:39.279 --> 08:44.082
And I'm sure Jamie
doesn't mind helping me out?

08:44.116 --> 08:46.050
Thank you.

08:46.086 --> 08:48.119
Ready? Let's go.

08:48.154 --> 08:50.288
Yeah.

08:50.323 --> 08:52.690
All right. Good luck,
you two.

08:57.230 --> 09:00.098
Really, no matter how long
it's been since I've seen you,

09:00.133 --> 09:01.799
you're still the same.

09:01.835 --> 09:04.402
Flecks of paint in your hair
and everything.

09:04.437 --> 09:07.338
Well, I am a painter...

09:07.373 --> 09:09.707
That's what I love about you.

09:09.742 --> 09:12.610
You know, the...
the paint.

09:12.645 --> 09:15.179
Right.

09:15.215 --> 09:16.380
Welcome home.

09:16.416 --> 09:17.548
Thanks, neighbour.

09:17.584 --> 09:19.684
If you ever want to come by
for a beer,

09:19.719 --> 09:20.719
I microbrew my own.

09:20.753 --> 09:25.314
That is a tempting offer
I'll keep in mind.

09:27.393 --> 09:29.827
Yeah, and I'll do the same.

09:44.110 --> 09:44.942
Yes?

09:44.978 --> 09:46.144
Hey, you forgot your...

09:46.179 --> 09:47.912
...Collaging supplies.

09:49.716 --> 09:50.748
So...

09:50.783 --> 09:52.150
You are collaging.

09:52.185 --> 09:57.221
Not yet, but more and more,
I'm thinking about it.

09:58.091 --> 10:00.324
Thanks.

10:30.990 --> 10:31.722
Hey, Dad.

10:31.758 --> 10:32.790
<i>Hi, honey.</i>

10:32.825 --> 10:35.560
The real estate agent
just sent over the lease.

10:35.595 --> 10:37.528
We need to decide by the end
of the week.

10:37.564 --> 10:39.197
Well, why wait?

10:39.232 --> 10:41.499
I mean, the space is exactly
what we're looking for.

10:44.003 --> 10:45.102
Let's sign.

10:45.138 --> 10:47.178
You don't want to give it
a little bit more thought?

10:47.207 --> 10:49.674
No.

10:49.709 --> 10:50.608
Why?

10:50.643 --> 10:52.176
Are you having second thoughts?

10:52.212 --> 10:53.077
No.

10:53.112 --> 10:54.245
I'm certain I wanna do this.

10:54.280 --> 10:57.415
I love building this out
and getting to work with you,

10:57.450 --> 11:00.751
but I wanna make sure
you're sure.

11:00.787 --> 11:03.654
Well, I'm sure.

11:03.690 --> 11:04.989
I'll look over the lease now.

11:05.024 --> 11:06.290
Love you.

11:06.326 --> 11:08.526
Love you. Bye.

11:40.260 --> 11:41.459
Good morning!

11:41.494 --> 11:42.260
Morning.

11:42.295 --> 11:43.227
You going for a run?

11:43.263 --> 11:43.995
Yup.

11:44.030 --> 11:45.596
Me too.

11:47.233 --> 11:49.934
Have a great run.

11:53.273 --> 11:55.773
Jamie, call me crazy,
but I'm starting to think

11:55.808 --> 11:58.976
that you're unhappy
that we're neighbours.

11:59.012 --> 12:01.279
Did I do something
to bother you?

12:01.314 --> 12:05.249
You mean besides a lifetime of
pranks and jokes at my expense?

12:05.585 --> 12:11.312
Max, every time I'm around you,
I get hurt or humiliated.

12:11.791 --> 12:14.225
That is not fair.

12:14.260 --> 12:16.160
Okay, give me one example.

12:16.195 --> 12:17.595
Okay.

12:17.630 --> 12:18.929
Third grade.

12:18.965 --> 12:22.333
You nicknamed me
Jamie Smellyman.

12:24.203 --> 12:25.403
We were kids.

12:25.438 --> 12:27.116
Which stuck with me through
high school when you wrote me

12:27.140 --> 12:29.507
love letters for an entire year
to prank me into thinking

12:29.542 --> 12:32.176
I had a secret admirer.

12:32.211 --> 12:35.012
- That was...
- A joke? I know, Max.

12:35.048 --> 12:37.415
With you, everything's a joke.

12:37.450 --> 12:40.318
On me.

12:40.353 --> 12:44.121
Every time you're around me,
you're teasing or immature.

12:44.157 --> 12:46.957
You're describing
15-year-old Max.

12:46.993 --> 12:52.830
We're adults now,
so can we start over?

12:52.865 --> 12:54.699
Okay.

12:54.734 --> 12:55.866
Good.

12:55.902 --> 12:58.836
Running buddies?

12:58.871 --> 13:00.938
Fine.

13:00.973 --> 13:02.039
Good.

13:05.945 --> 13:07.011
Sorry.

13:08.348 --> 13:09.146
Yeah.

13:09.182 --> 13:10.259
Let's, uh... Can we try
that again?

13:10.283 --> 13:11.148
Yeah.

13:11.184 --> 13:12.116
Yeah...

13:12.151 --> 13:13.384
Your... your painting.

13:13.419 --> 13:15.619
You workin' on any showcases
or something?

13:15.655 --> 13:17.688
No, I'm not showing right now.

13:17.724 --> 13:18.556
I mean...

13:18.591 --> 13:19.357
Why not?

13:19.392 --> 13:21.192
Because I'm not painting
right now.

13:21.227 --> 13:22.460
Okay.

13:22.495 --> 13:24.606
I opened an art school a year
ago and I'm focusing on that.

13:24.630 --> 13:26.597
Okay, well, what about
your dating life.

13:26.632 --> 13:27.431
What happened there?

13:27.467 --> 13:30.768
You were dating someone,
and like...

13:30.803 --> 13:33.537
Actually, I forgot something
at home.

13:33.573 --> 13:36.674
I'll run back.

13:38.578 --> 13:40.277
So, how's it been with Max?

13:40.313 --> 13:42.380
Fine.

13:42.415 --> 13:44.181
Fine?
Oh no, that bad?

13:44.984 --> 13:45.984
Worse?

13:46.853 --> 13:48.230
Well, remember, you
can have anything you want

13:48.254 --> 13:49.286
if you just...

13:49.322 --> 13:51.222
Please don't say vision board.

13:51.257 --> 13:52.490
Okay.

13:52.525 --> 13:54.625
But speaking of vision boards,
I brought mine.

13:54.660 --> 13:55.626
Ava!

13:55.661 --> 13:57.828
I just don't want you to give up
on your dreams.

13:57.864 --> 14:00.097
Okay, what if I'm not giving up
on my dreams,

14:00.133 --> 14:03.567
what if my dreams are just...
changing?

14:03.603 --> 14:04.603
And what if they're not?

14:04.637 --> 14:08.272
Why don't you just vision board
to double check?

14:08.307 --> 14:09.607
Because I don't collage.

14:09.642 --> 14:10.841
Then paint.

14:10.877 --> 14:12.443
I asked myself what
I really wanted.

14:12.478 --> 14:15.112
That I made a board, and
I focused on it every day,

14:15.148 --> 14:19.617
and it came true.

14:19.652 --> 14:20.951
Guess who I'm about
to meet with?

14:20.987 --> 14:21.987
Who?

14:22.021 --> 14:24.288
The curator of the Cherry
Blossom Arts Festival.

14:24.323 --> 14:27.525
I could put in a good word for
the emerging artist showcase.

14:27.560 --> 14:28.426
Thank you.

14:28.461 --> 14:31.796
I've mentioned
you're relentless, right?

14:31.831 --> 14:33.130
Once or twice.

15:29.856 --> 15:31.989
Well, Renee, it was so nice
to meet you.

15:32.024 --> 15:32.890
And you, too.

15:32.925 --> 15:35.025
It's so nice to put
a face to a name.

15:36.162 --> 15:37.840
And thank you so much
for expediting the permits.

15:37.864 --> 15:41.832
When we lost our venue, I didn't
know what we were gonna do.

15:41.868 --> 15:43.033
My pleasure.

15:43.069 --> 15:45.169
I know what the festival means
to this town,

15:45.204 --> 15:48.806
and the botanical gardens is
going to be a gorgeous venue.

15:48.841 --> 15:50.374
And so convenient.

15:50.409 --> 15:52.443
The Herman Arts Foundation
is just down the street.

15:52.478 --> 15:53.844
York and Seventh.

15:54.981 --> 15:57.615
That's a block away from
my best friend's art school,

15:57.650 --> 15:58.749
Canvas Creations?

15:58.784 --> 16:00.429
Funny enough, the head of
the Herman Arts Foundation

16:00.453 --> 16:02.286
was thinking about stopping in

16:02.321 --> 16:04.388
and asking about
painting lessons.

16:04.423 --> 16:05.322
Well, actually...

16:05.358 --> 16:06.902
Does your friend not do
painting lessons?

16:06.926 --> 16:07.758
No, no, no.

16:07.793 --> 16:12.363
She does, but speaking
of my friend...

16:16.235 --> 16:18.969
- Hi Michael.
- I missed the meeting?

16:19.005 --> 16:19.770
Sorry.

16:19.805 --> 16:21.038
I'll fill you in.

16:21.073 --> 16:25.009
The permitting is taken care of,
and everything is on schedule.

16:25.044 --> 16:28.379
And that art school
down the street from us,

16:28.414 --> 16:31.081
the one that you were looking at
for painting classes?

16:31.117 --> 16:33.717
The teacher sounds great.

16:40.459 --> 16:41.692
Hey.

16:46.132 --> 16:50.868
Guess who has a private showing
with the curator of the art festival?

16:50.903 --> 16:52.469
I'm hoping it's you?

16:52.505 --> 16:55.573
Renee's coming here on Thursday
to review your work

16:55.608 --> 16:56.818
for the emerging
artist showcase.

16:56.842 --> 17:00.077
Which would be great, except I
have no work for her to review.

17:00.112 --> 17:01.011
What about the landscapes?

17:01.047 --> 17:03.347
I submitted all my best stuff
last year.

17:03.382 --> 17:06.317
Wait, you're painting?

17:06.352 --> 17:08.085
Not exactly...

17:08.119 --> 17:11.454
Vision boarding?

17:11.490 --> 17:12.790
Show me.

17:12.825 --> 17:14.023
Now.

17:17.262 --> 17:21.699
Jamie... It's beautiful.

17:21.733 --> 17:23.200
Well, I thought about
what I wanted,

17:23.234 --> 17:26.704
and this just came to me.

17:26.739 --> 17:33.110
It's after I win the showcase,
my first solo show in Paris.

17:33.145 --> 17:37.481
This is an exhibit of my art
in a colonnade

17:37.516 --> 17:38.616
and this is the man I love

17:38.651 --> 17:41.118
bringing me a rose
to congratulate me.

17:41.153 --> 17:44.388
In this moment, I have
everything I've ever wanted.

17:46.959 --> 17:49.360
And although this may
never happen,

17:50.630 --> 17:54.231
I have to say thank you.

17:54.266 --> 17:56.367
I'm painting again.

17:56.402 --> 17:57.968
I'm happy for you.

17:58.004 --> 18:03.641
Now finish it so it can happen,
because you are about

18:03.676 --> 18:07.244
to make all your dreams
come true.

18:16.289 --> 18:18.456
One final signature.

18:21.795 --> 18:25.129
And congratulations.

18:25.165 --> 18:26.331
Thank you.

18:26.366 --> 18:27.098
Thank you!

18:27.133 --> 18:27.999
Should we celebrate?

18:28.034 --> 18:29.578
I, saw a donut shop
down the street.

18:29.602 --> 18:31.202
We could review our notes
for our meeting

18:31.237 --> 18:32.270
with the contractors.

18:32.305 --> 18:34.005
Do you mind if we do
it tomorrow?

18:34.040 --> 18:36.641
I know, I know, we have
so much to do,

18:36.676 --> 18:42.375
but I have class later, and
I wanna get some painting in.

18:43.383 --> 18:44.482
Ava got me a showing

18:44.517 --> 18:48.186
with the curator of the Cherry
Blossoms Art Festival.

18:48.221 --> 18:49.454
That's wonderful, honey.

18:49.489 --> 18:53.391
So, you're painting again.

19:01.935 --> 19:04.268
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:04.304 --> 19:06.304
Am I too late to join
the art class?

19:06.906 --> 19:09.107
Do you take drop-ins?

19:10.210 --> 19:11.342
Of course.

19:11.378 --> 19:12.176
'Kay.

19:12.212 --> 19:13.244
Come on in.

19:13.279 --> 19:14.912
Thanks.

19:16.916 --> 19:18.783
They're all...

19:18.818 --> 19:21.619
Extremely talented artists?

19:21.654 --> 19:23.755
Yes, that too.

19:27.594 --> 19:29.560
I didn't realize this is
a school for children.

19:29.596 --> 19:30.862
Sorry about the mix-up.

19:30.897 --> 19:32.864
Don't be intimidated.

19:32.899 --> 19:34.632
It was everyone's first day,
once.

19:34.667 --> 19:35.700
It's for kids.

19:35.735 --> 19:39.170
It's for the young at heart.

19:39.205 --> 19:40.171
Come on.

19:40.206 --> 19:45.943
So, today, we're learning
about composition.

19:45.979 --> 19:48.446
- Okay.
- Okay.

19:52.585 --> 19:55.119
I'm Jamie, by the way.

19:55.155 --> 19:58.389
Hi, I'm Michael.

19:58.425 --> 20:00.425
Lovely.

20:00.460 --> 20:02.660
And the light is coming from?

20:02.695 --> 20:03.528
Here.

20:03.563 --> 20:06.831
Very good.

20:06.866 --> 20:07.965
How am I doing?

20:08.001 --> 20:13.304
Well, we don't give grades here,
but you're doing great.

20:13.339 --> 20:14.639
You really caught
the light here,

20:14.674 --> 20:15.907
which is difficult.

20:15.942 --> 20:18.943
It's a little too controlled,

20:18.978 --> 20:22.313
a little too concerned
with the outcome.

20:22.348 --> 20:25.083
You can see all that from this?

20:25.118 --> 20:29.487
Art is very revealing.

20:29.522 --> 20:31.622
Don't beat yourself up over it.

20:31.658 --> 20:34.992
I actually struggle with it
in my work, too.

20:35.028 --> 20:37.395
So, what do you do
to counteract it?

20:37.430 --> 20:39.497
Well, when I remember to,

20:39.532 --> 20:44.202
I try to let go of expectations
of perfection.

20:45.472 --> 20:50.310
And just relax and...

20:51.140 --> 20:53.949
...let myself enjoy
the creative process.

20:54.714 --> 20:58.855
So, what do you suggest I do?

21:01.621 --> 21:11.158
Take a new canvas,
and this time, don't make,

21:11.264 --> 21:15.733
just... let yourself feel.

21:18.304 --> 21:19.470
Go on.

21:19.506 --> 21:21.038
Okay.

21:32.318 --> 21:34.085
I'll see you soon.

21:34.120 --> 21:35.186
Bye, Miss Jamie.

21:35.221 --> 21:36.154
Bye, Lizzie.

21:36.189 --> 21:38.756
Remember, composition!

21:38.791 --> 21:40.024
Bye.

21:42.061 --> 21:43.194
So.

21:43.229 --> 21:44.195
What did you think?

21:44.230 --> 21:46.531
I think the jury's out
on my innate creativity,

21:46.566 --> 21:50.701
but the upside is, I've got
a lot of kindling, so...

21:50.737 --> 21:52.770
No, look, this is progress.

21:52.805 --> 21:55.173
Don't give up yet, it was
just your first lesson.

21:55.208 --> 21:56.340
Yeah.

21:56.376 --> 21:57.553
I could definitely use another.

21:57.577 --> 22:00.478
Yeah, you might like the 13
to 15-year-old class better.

22:01.581 --> 22:04.348
Or maybe a one-on-one.

22:04.384 --> 22:09.353
Do you offer
private instruction?

22:09.389 --> 22:11.489
I do.

22:11.524 --> 22:16.027
Do you have availability
Thursday, 5:00 PM?

22:16.062 --> 22:17.295
I do.

22:17.330 --> 22:21.799
That would be perfect.

22:25.171 --> 22:26.337
You have a date?

22:26.372 --> 22:27.471
It's a lesson.

22:27.507 --> 22:28.306
He's a student.

22:28.341 --> 22:29.440
It's professional.

22:30.677 --> 22:32.743
But he is really handsome.

22:32.779 --> 22:34.045
And he has an accent.

22:34.080 --> 22:36.247
Maybe.

22:36.282 --> 22:38.548
Have you decided what you're
going to show Renee tomorrow?

22:38.550 --> 22:39.717
No.

22:39.752 --> 22:43.054
I wanted to paint something new,
but what are we doing here?

22:43.089 --> 22:45.790
Max is redoing our garden.

22:45.825 --> 22:46.825
Max.

22:47.493 --> 22:50.161
Does that mean he's meeting
us here?

22:50.196 --> 22:52.029
Yeah. Why?

22:52.065 --> 22:53.642
Don't tell me you're gonna
run away just to avoid him.

22:53.666 --> 22:57.134
I wouldn't phrase it
like that, but...

22:57.170 --> 22:58.936
Hey, guys.

23:04.143 --> 23:04.942
Thanks.

23:04.978 --> 23:06.244
Thank you.

23:06.279 --> 23:07.912
- You good?
- Yeah.

23:07.947 --> 23:09.825
Renee and I will be by
at 10:00 on Thursday.

23:09.849 --> 23:14.151
- Good luck painting.
- Thank you, I need the good luck.

23:14.187 --> 23:17.688
You headed home?
I can, walk you.

23:17.724 --> 23:18.990
You know, actually,

23:19.025 --> 23:21.359
I have to go to the Farmer's
Market, so...

23:21.394 --> 23:22.326
That's perfect.

23:22.362 --> 23:23.572
I have to head there
and pick up some basil,

23:23.596 --> 23:26.330
I'm making pesto for dinner.

23:26.366 --> 23:28.532
- Pesto?
- Yeah.

23:30.069 --> 23:33.437
So, did I hear Ava say
that you were painting again?

23:33.473 --> 23:34.405
Yeah.

23:34.440 --> 23:36.941
I'm working on a submission
for a showcase.

23:36.976 --> 23:38.342
That's awesome.

23:38.378 --> 23:39.488
I was actually getting
kinda sad,

23:39.512 --> 23:41.323
thinking that you weren't
going to make art anymore.

23:41.347 --> 23:44.248
I'm kind of a big fan.

23:45.151 --> 23:46.517
What?

23:46.552 --> 23:48.530
I remember when you were a kid,
you'd be out in your yard for hours,

23:48.554 --> 23:50.788
just painting with whatever
you could find.

23:50.823 --> 23:52.456
Chalk, sticks, dirt.

23:52.492 --> 23:56.594
Do you remember when you made
that massive mud mural?

23:56.629 --> 23:58.029
That was awesome.

23:58.064 --> 23:59.130
Yeah, well, too bad

23:59.165 --> 24:01.165
you can't make a living
off of sidewalk art, right?

24:01.834 --> 24:03.734
Yeah, Ava also told me
your school's going well.

24:03.770 --> 24:04.869
Yeah.

24:04.904 --> 24:08.005
My dad and I are actually teaming up
to open some new locations.

24:08.041 --> 24:11.409
Congrats, that's...
that's awesome.

24:11.444 --> 24:12.543
Hold on.

24:12.578 --> 24:15.279
If you're running two locations,
and working with kids,

24:15.315 --> 24:17.882
where's that going to leave time
for painting?

24:17.917 --> 24:19.617
I'll paint on the side.

24:19.652 --> 24:21.752
Jamie, you are not
a paint on the side-er,

24:21.788 --> 24:24.755
don't you think you should be
focusing on your art?

24:24.791 --> 24:27.758
What, so now you're an expert
on how I should live my life?

24:28.361 --> 24:29.260
Well, hang on a second.

24:29.295 --> 24:30.506
Let me get a pen,
I'll just take notes.

24:30.530 --> 24:31.295
Okay.

24:31.331 --> 24:35.966
First note, commit to your art.

24:36.002 --> 24:37.201
Really?

24:37.236 --> 24:40.738
You're giving me advice
on how to commit?

24:40.773 --> 24:41.839
I could commit.

24:42.809 --> 24:43.908
To what?

24:43.943 --> 24:45.187
To following my heart,
even though half the time

24:45.211 --> 24:46.177
I have no clue
where that takes me.

24:46.212 --> 24:48.479
Okay, according to Ava,
over the past six years,

24:48.514 --> 24:50.915
it's taken you to over
a dozen cities,

24:50.950 --> 24:53.818
jobs, and girlfriends.

24:53.853 --> 24:56.654
Okay, I am trying to figure
out what I want, okay?

24:56.689 --> 24:57.755
Maybe.

24:57.790 --> 25:00.157
Or maybe it's just you
like "the new," "the chase,"

25:00.193 --> 25:02.493
and then when something
loses its novelty...

25:04.630 --> 25:05.563
Like I said.

25:05.598 --> 25:08.065
I'm figuring out what I want.
I'm not as lucky as you.

25:08.101 --> 25:11.168
You've always known
what you want... to paint.

25:11.204 --> 25:17.108
Well, as usual, Max,
this has been... interesting.

25:17.143 --> 25:19.844
Okay, wait. Let me guess.

25:19.879 --> 25:23.180
You forgot something at home,
and now you have to run and get it.

25:23.216 --> 25:25.316
Bye, Max.

25:25.718 --> 25:27.718
See you at home.

26:23.743 --> 26:25.409
Thank you.

26:25.445 --> 26:26.410
What time is it?

26:26.446 --> 26:27.745
Time to wake up.

26:27.780 --> 26:29.513
Renee is gonna be here
in less than an hour.

26:29.549 --> 26:34.552
Have you decided what
you're gonna show...

26:34.587 --> 26:37.421
Jamie, it's beautiful.

26:37.457 --> 26:39.723
Renee is gonna love it.

26:39.759 --> 26:41.725
I'm not showing her that.

26:41.761 --> 26:44.929
Then why were you up
all night painting it?

26:44.964 --> 26:50.100
Because, I felt... inspired.

26:50.136 --> 26:53.270
But I'm not showing Renee
a vision board.

26:53.306 --> 26:56.407
We'll just, display some
of my old landscapes

26:56.442 --> 27:00.711
I haven't submitted before.

27:00.746 --> 27:02.913
I'll go clean up.

27:14.994 --> 27:16.160
So, Jamie.

27:16.195 --> 27:17.094
Yes.

27:17.129 --> 27:18.529
When did you start painting?

27:18.564 --> 27:19.604
When I was in high school.

27:19.632 --> 27:22.466
Well, actually, I guess
I've always been painting,

27:22.502 --> 27:24.602
in some form or another.

27:24.637 --> 27:26.904
I mean, when I was a kid
I used to sit and make art

27:26.939 --> 27:28.439
with anything I could find,

27:28.474 --> 27:31.876
but I started seriously painting
when I was 15,

27:31.911 --> 27:36.514
and then art school,
and got an MFA.

27:36.549 --> 27:37.748
Well.

27:37.783 --> 27:40.918
You are incredibly talented,

27:40.953 --> 27:44.588
and there are so many successful
elements here.

27:44.624 --> 27:49.260
But... I'm just not feeling
the emotion.

27:49.295 --> 27:52.796
Some of your work feels
as if it's forced,

27:52.832 --> 27:57.201
almost as if you're
playing it safe.

27:57.236 --> 28:00.905
Do you have anything else that
maybe I could take a look at?

28:00.940 --> 28:02.606
Not at this time.

28:02.642 --> 28:05.476
Well then, I thank you
for sharing.

28:05.511 --> 28:06.722
It has truly been a privilege...

28:06.746 --> 28:08.913
Actually, she does.

28:08.948 --> 28:09.880
No, I don't.

28:09.916 --> 28:10.648
She does.

28:10.683 --> 28:11.482
You do.

28:11.517 --> 28:12.383
I don't.

28:12.418 --> 28:13.350
She does.

28:13.386 --> 28:14.318
It's beautiful.

28:14.353 --> 28:19.223
It's from Jamie's new series
about... dreams.

28:19.258 --> 28:21.358
Well then, I would
love to see it.

28:21.394 --> 28:23.994
Right this way.

28:31.837 --> 28:33.237
I love it.

28:33.272 --> 28:36.807
It's heartfelt, and bold,
and it takes a chance.

28:38.110 --> 28:40.778
Do you think you can get it to me
in time for the art festival?

28:40.813 --> 28:42.179
Yes!

28:42.214 --> 28:43.480
So I'm in the showcase?

28:45.117 --> 28:46.250
This is in the showcase?

28:46.285 --> 28:47.818
Congratulations.

28:47.853 --> 28:49.687
Thank you.

28:49.722 --> 28:50.854
Vision.

28:50.890 --> 28:52.690
Board.

28:58.064 --> 28:59.229
Hey.

28:59.265 --> 29:01.732
You've been busy.

29:01.767 --> 29:05.002
Just some potential plans,
how we could use the space,

29:05.037 --> 29:06.870
a list of contractors
and vendors,

29:06.906 --> 29:09.206
and the start of
an operations manual

29:09.241 --> 29:11.041
for hiring and best practices.

29:11.077 --> 29:13.177
I've also emailed it to you.

29:13.212 --> 29:15.179
Dad.

29:15.214 --> 29:16.780
You've done so much!

29:16.816 --> 29:19.516
I'm excited,
and I've got the time,

29:19.552 --> 29:21.952
and I know you got a lot
on your plate.

29:21.988 --> 29:24.221
Well, it's just until I turn
in this painting,

29:24.256 --> 29:27.291
and then I promise, you will
have my undivided attention.

29:27.326 --> 29:29.460
Okay, honey.

29:29.495 --> 29:32.429
I almost forgot the most
important part.

29:32.465 --> 29:34.465
What's that?

29:38.204 --> 29:40.771
Donuts!

30:02.395 --> 30:03.635
Don't get enough of me at home.

30:05.731 --> 30:08.799
Sorry.

30:08.834 --> 30:10.167
How's work going?

30:10.202 --> 30:11.568
A walk in the park.

30:11.604 --> 30:13.470
It's only my fourth day
so we'll see.

30:13.506 --> 30:17.775
Four days. That's
a commitment for you.

30:17.810 --> 30:19.443
Can I take a look?

30:19.478 --> 30:21.278
Sure.

30:28.921 --> 30:31.422
It's beautiful.

30:31.457 --> 30:34.058
Well, it's easy to make
something beautiful

30:34.093 --> 30:37.261
when all this is your subject.

30:37.296 --> 30:39.963
You're modest, but you're right.

30:39.999 --> 30:44.802
Cherry blossom season is
the best time of the year.

30:44.837 --> 30:49.373
When I was homesick, this is
pretty much what I thought of.

30:49.408 --> 30:52.743
Yeah, they're pretty perfect.

30:52.778 --> 30:56.547
Their form, their colour,
their composition.

30:56.582 --> 31:00.050
You know what's funny,
I never really thought of them like that.

31:00.086 --> 31:02.019
Well, what do you think about?

31:02.054 --> 31:04.188
How they make me feel?

31:07.126 --> 31:08.992
And how is that?

31:09.028 --> 31:14.154
Like perfection does exist,
although fleeting, like life.

31:15.101 --> 31:19.436
It's all the more precious
for its uncertainty.

31:23.776 --> 31:26.677
Ava told me that you got
accepted into that showcase.

31:26.712 --> 31:30.114
With her help, yes.

31:30.149 --> 31:35.018
And first prize is a solo show
in Paris, your dream.

31:35.054 --> 31:37.121
Surprised you remember that.

31:37.156 --> 31:38.800
Really? We've known each other
for 24 years,

31:38.824 --> 31:41.225
you'd think you mentioned Paris
once or twice

31:41.260 --> 31:42.893
or a thousand times.

31:42.928 --> 31:45.429
Yeah, it's an artist's cliché.

31:45.464 --> 31:46.964
A show in Paris.

31:46.999 --> 31:48.298
Who cares if it's cliché.

31:48.334 --> 31:50.467
You know for once I think
I can get behind

31:50.503 --> 31:53.637
your cavalier attitude.

32:02.148 --> 32:03.447
Did I just make you smile?

32:03.482 --> 32:05.516
No, I smiled on my own.

32:05.551 --> 32:07.417
Okay.

32:07.453 --> 32:10.821
Thank you. I should get going.

32:10.856 --> 32:12.456
Thank you for the walk.

32:12.491 --> 32:13.857
You're welcome.

32:13.893 --> 32:15.926
Come back.

32:15.961 --> 32:17.628
Bring your students.

32:17.663 --> 32:18.962
That's a good idea.

32:18.998 --> 32:21.932
Yeah, I know. I'm full of them.

32:35.948 --> 32:37.347
Hey.

32:37.383 --> 32:39.316
Hi.

32:42.955 --> 32:44.655
You ready?

32:44.690 --> 32:46.123
Yes.

32:46.158 --> 32:48.692
I chose bottles because
painting glass is tricky,

32:48.727 --> 32:50.027
especially in this light.

32:50.062 --> 32:54.798
So it forces us to stop
and really look.

32:54.834 --> 32:55.834
You know?

32:55.868 --> 32:57.479
And then upon studying it,
you realize it's...

32:57.503 --> 32:59.770
it's so much more than just
glass and a bottle.

32:59.805 --> 33:03.540
Highlights, lowlights,
shade, tone?

33:03.576 --> 33:04.975
How do you know that?

33:05.010 --> 33:06.243
I love art.

33:07.246 --> 33:08.412
I painted when I was young.

33:08.447 --> 33:11.315
I actually had delusions of
being a professional artist.

33:11.350 --> 33:12.950
Yeah.

33:12.985 --> 33:18.388
Well, in the art world,
we call delusions "dreams".

33:20.092 --> 33:22.025
So what happened?

33:22.061 --> 33:25.495
I wanted a career path
with a bit more stability.

33:26.699 --> 33:31.301
But also I found it too hard
to put my work out there,

33:31.337 --> 33:33.570
to put myself out there
in that way.

33:33.606 --> 33:35.739
I know what you mean.

33:40.112 --> 33:41.812
Plus, I hate getting messy.

33:41.847 --> 33:44.982
Well, that may be hard to avoid,

33:45.017 --> 33:50.988
because art is... messy.

33:53.626 --> 33:54.491
I have an idea.

33:54.526 --> 33:57.361
Baby steps putting yourself
out there.

33:57.396 --> 34:01.765
Canvas Creations is having
our spring show.

34:01.800 --> 34:04.334
Maybe you could display
something.

34:04.370 --> 34:08.804
I'll give it some thought.

34:08.841 --> 34:10.172
What about you?

34:10.208 --> 34:12.087
What's your work like, you know,
what do you paint?

34:12.110 --> 34:16.013
Whoo, not really sure
how to answer that.

34:16.047 --> 34:18.415
Well, I took a year away
from painting,

34:18.449 --> 34:22.652
and now I'm back with
something different,

34:22.688 --> 34:26.489
it looks different,
it feels different.

34:26.525 --> 34:29.259
So, will you show me this
magical painting of yours?

34:29.295 --> 34:31.594
Yeah.
I'd love to...

34:31.630 --> 34:32.795
When it's done.

34:32.831 --> 34:36.967
That means I get to see
you again.

34:37.002 --> 34:39.101
I'd like that.

34:50.984 --> 34:51.783
So, how was your date?

34:51.818 --> 34:55.553
It wasn't a date,
it was a lesson.

34:55.589 --> 34:57.922
But, I think we might
see each other again.

34:57.958 --> 34:59.924
Like, as a date, or a lesson?

35:01.228 --> 35:04.829
I'm not sure, just as it seemed
like he was gonna ask me out,

35:04.865 --> 35:06.364
he got a phone call
and had to leave.

35:06.399 --> 35:09.300
And how's the Canvas
Creations expansion?

35:09.336 --> 35:11.480
Honestly, I feel like I'm not
really pulling my weight,

35:11.504 --> 35:14.138
with all the painting I'm doing
for the showcase.

35:14.174 --> 35:15.940
And what happens if you win
the showcase?

35:15.976 --> 35:18.042
Are you really gonna want
to stop working

35:18.078 --> 35:21.279
on your solo show in Paris
to do marketing?

35:21.314 --> 35:23.081
I don't know.

35:23.116 --> 35:24.749
Think about it.

35:42.636 --> 35:44.168
Well, aren't I full of
good ideas?

35:45.238 --> 35:46.582
Don't make me remind you of
all the bad ideas

35:46.606 --> 35:48.339
you've had over the years.

35:48.375 --> 35:49.173
Let's see.

35:49.209 --> 35:51.943
"Golf cart in a lake"
ring a bell?

35:53.013 --> 35:53.912
That was a good one.

35:53.947 --> 35:55.613
You know what, let's focus
on the present.

35:57.284 --> 35:58.449
I got another good idea.

35:58.485 --> 36:01.219
When you're done here, come
meet me at the rose garden,

36:01.254 --> 36:03.721
I'll come give you a special
behind the scenes tour.

36:03.757 --> 36:05.390
Thank you, but I'm busy.

36:05.425 --> 36:07.058
I can't hear you.

36:07.093 --> 36:07.892
And I'll see you later.

36:07.928 --> 36:08.960
I...

36:21.308 --> 36:23.508
So, this is our next project.

36:24.444 --> 36:26.110
Yeah, we, just finished
the design

36:26.146 --> 36:29.280
and then we go into
the planting process.

36:29.316 --> 36:30.860
Well, do you think you'll stick
around long enough

36:30.884 --> 36:34.352
to see it finished?

36:34.387 --> 36:35.653
I don't know.

36:35.689 --> 36:38.756
But, I bet you're eager to have
a new neighbour, so...

36:38.792 --> 36:40.992
Actually, I was kinda learning
to enjoy

36:41.027 --> 36:43.061
having you as a neighbour.

36:43.096 --> 36:44.529
Thanks, Jamie.

36:44.564 --> 36:47.098
I wish it didn't need the
"actually", or "kind of",

36:47.133 --> 36:49.267
or "learning to,"
but besides that,

36:49.302 --> 36:52.603
yeah, I think that is the nicest
thing you've ever said to me.

36:52.639 --> 36:54.339
You're welcome.

36:54.374 --> 36:55.239
We're, interviewing

36:55.275 --> 36:58.309
for the landscape
architect position.

36:58.345 --> 37:00.311
I'm confused.

37:00.347 --> 37:04.048
You have a Master's in
landscape architecture.

37:04.084 --> 37:04.849
I do.

37:04.884 --> 37:08.286
So you're a landscape architect.

37:08.321 --> 37:09.887
Yeah, I am.

37:09.923 --> 37:12.657
So, why don't you apply
for the position?

37:12.692 --> 37:13.758
No, no, no.

37:13.793 --> 37:14.913
Way too much responsibility.

37:16.129 --> 37:17.061
It's all managing,
and coordinating,

37:17.097 --> 37:19.831
and bureaucracy, and
as the groundskeeper,

37:19.866 --> 37:21.899
I just get to play
in the dirt all day.

37:21.935 --> 37:23.835
- Of course.
- Of course.

37:23.870 --> 37:25.081
And you know, who knows how long
I wanna be around.

37:25.105 --> 37:26.816
There's no way I'm getting tied
down with these obligations

37:26.840 --> 37:27.840
and responsibilities.

37:27.874 --> 37:30.274
You mean "life?"

37:30.310 --> 37:32.777
No, that's not life.

37:32.812 --> 37:37.415
Life is passion and fun
and travelling, and...

37:39.185 --> 37:40.618
Life should be an adventure.

37:40.653 --> 37:43.721
Me personally, I don't want
to have any regrets.

37:43.757 --> 37:47.025
But never committing to anything
has regrets of its own.

37:47.060 --> 37:51.362
Now who's the expert
on someone else's life?

37:51.398 --> 37:54.165
You're exasperating.

37:54.200 --> 37:57.335
Yet, you are smiling.

38:01.241 --> 38:02.340
<i>Let's go.</i>

38:04.144 --> 38:06.310
Ava said that your vision board
was going well.

38:06.346 --> 38:08.646
She did, did she?

38:08.681 --> 38:09.480
Yeah.

38:09.516 --> 38:10.548
What else did she say?

38:10.583 --> 38:13.684
She mentioned something
about a shadowy dream man.

38:13.720 --> 38:16.320
It was in passing, but...

38:16.356 --> 38:20.124
This dream man, who is he?

38:20.160 --> 38:21.025
I don't know.

38:21.061 --> 38:24.695
What do you think he's like?

38:24.731 --> 38:27.532
Well, he's perfect.

38:27.567 --> 38:28.499
Sounds like me.

38:28.535 --> 38:30.146
He's also too humble to know
he's perfect.

38:30.170 --> 38:32.003
Also sounds like me.

38:32.038 --> 38:33.538
Okay.

38:33.573 --> 38:40.411
He's... kind, and passionate,
charitable, intelligent,

38:40.447 --> 38:43.414
well, he loves art, and of
course he's very handsome.

38:43.450 --> 38:45.416
Of course.

38:45.452 --> 38:48.019
But, how does he make you feel?

38:48.054 --> 38:49.487
'Cause there's
tons of intelligent,

38:49.522 --> 38:52.290
smart, articulate men out there,
me for example,

38:52.325 --> 38:55.960
but what matters is
how he makes you feel.

39:01.701 --> 39:03.367
I'll give it some thought.

39:03.403 --> 39:06.137
Right now, I have to go.

39:12.445 --> 39:14.145
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:14.180 --> 39:15.713
I'm sorry I had to
run off yesterday,

39:15.748 --> 39:17.882
and we didn't get to finish
our conversation

39:17.917 --> 39:20.084
about seeing each other again.

39:20.120 --> 39:21.786
For another lesson.

39:21.821 --> 39:25.223
I was thinking more like a date.

39:27.160 --> 39:29.193
Sure.

39:29.229 --> 39:30.361
Okay.

39:30.396 --> 39:31.396
Tomorrow night?

39:31.431 --> 39:32.497
Great.

39:32.532 --> 39:33.331
Perfect.

39:33.366 --> 39:34.465
Okay...

39:54.821 --> 39:56.687
I walked out without
giving this to you...

39:56.723 --> 40:00.024
But, I, saw it in a florist,

40:00.059 --> 40:03.794
and it made me think of you.

40:12.639 --> 40:14.605
It's breathtaking.

40:14.641 --> 40:15.907
See you tomorrow night?

40:15.942 --> 40:17.008
Yes.

40:35.428 --> 40:38.629
The vision board man is Michael.

40:38.665 --> 40:40.865
It's like he just stepped out
of my painting.

40:40.900 --> 40:42.400
This is weird.

40:42.435 --> 40:45.369
I mean, there has to be a
logical explanation for it.

40:45.405 --> 40:49.540
Sometimes in life, there
are no logical explanations.

40:49.576 --> 40:51.242
Like with love.

41:03.289 --> 41:04.222
Is that Michael?

41:04.257 --> 41:05.756
No, it's Max.

41:05.792 --> 41:07.458
Max who?

41:07.493 --> 41:09.860
Max, your brother?

41:09.896 --> 41:12.463
Excuse me, my brother
is texting you,

41:12.498 --> 41:13.598
and you're smiling.

41:13.633 --> 41:17.168
But you're not just like,
"smiling" you are smiling.

41:17.203 --> 41:18.569
I'm not smiling like anything.

41:18.605 --> 41:20.504
I'm definitely not smiling
like that.

41:20.540 --> 41:24.408
Nobody is smiling like that.

41:24.444 --> 41:26.811
Ava, you asked us to get along,
so we're getting along.

41:26.846 --> 41:27.745
That's it.

41:27.780 --> 41:29.680
Fine.

41:40.226 --> 41:41.425
Surprises, surprises.

41:41.461 --> 41:42.860
You actually showed up.

41:42.895 --> 41:44.195
I did.

41:44.230 --> 41:45.630
But I can only stay
for a little.

41:45.665 --> 41:47.265
I'm meeting my dad in an hour.

41:47.300 --> 41:48.300
Okay.

41:49.335 --> 41:50.401
Okay.

41:53.439 --> 41:56.140
Setting up for the Cherry
Blossom Art Festival.

41:56.175 --> 41:57.175
Yeah.

42:01.080 --> 42:02.046
Seriously?

42:02.081 --> 42:05.383
Hey, you still remember
how to drive this thing?

42:05.418 --> 42:06.550
I think?

42:06.586 --> 42:08.163
All right, yeah, you put
one foot in front of the other,

42:08.187 --> 42:09.187
and you pedal.

42:10.723 --> 42:11.622
Let's go.

42:11.658 --> 42:12.556
Yeah.

42:12.592 --> 42:13.736
Why don't you take that one
and we race?

42:13.760 --> 42:14.825
How's that sound?

42:17.697 --> 42:20.064
Is it weird that
we're doing this?

42:20.099 --> 42:21.365
Why would it be weird?

42:21.401 --> 42:24.602
'Cause, this is like
total dating activity,

42:24.637 --> 42:25.936
and we are not dating.

42:25.972 --> 42:30.141
No, not a date, just,
two friends cycling.

42:30.977 --> 42:32.843
Since you brought it up,

42:32.879 --> 42:34.290
what's going on
with your dating life?

42:34.314 --> 42:35.858
I thought for sure
you were going to end up

42:35.882 --> 42:37.948
marrying your ex,
whatever his name was.

42:37.984 --> 42:43.254
Ha, I also thought I would
marry whatever his name was.

42:43.289 --> 42:45.256
So, what happened?

42:45.291 --> 42:49.327
He said he thought
we'd lost our spark.

42:50.296 --> 42:51.696
And if he stayed with me,

42:51.731 --> 42:54.565
he'd feel like he was making
the safe choice.

42:55.601 --> 42:56.534
Ouch.

42:56.569 --> 42:57.501
Yeah.

42:57.537 --> 42:59.503
Ouch.

42:59.539 --> 43:00.871
What did you think?

43:00.907 --> 43:02.006
Well, I was heartbroken,

43:02.041 --> 43:04.742
and I thought for sure
he was wrong.

43:04.777 --> 43:08.679
I mean, relationships
are more than a spark,

43:08.715 --> 43:12.350
they're history
and compatibility.

43:12.385 --> 43:16.120
Sharing lives.

43:16.155 --> 43:19.423
But now I'm starting to see
he was right,

43:19.459 --> 43:22.626
we would've been settling.

43:22.662 --> 43:24.862
The breakup was really hard.

43:24.897 --> 43:26.230
It made me question everything.

43:26.265 --> 43:31.602
I mean, I... I was so sure my
life would turn out this one way,

43:31.637 --> 43:36.474
and then suddenly
I was 29, single,

43:36.509 --> 43:39.443
my art wasn't panning out
the way I thought it would,

43:39.479 --> 43:44.148
and I realized I couldn't
keep living a dream.

43:44.183 --> 43:45.983
So you opened Canvas Creations?

43:46.018 --> 43:47.852
Yeah.

43:47.887 --> 43:53.858
It was sort of a plan B
that's become a plan A.

43:55.795 --> 43:56.827
What about you?

43:56.863 --> 44:00.998
You dating anyone?

44:01.033 --> 44:03.934
No.

44:03.970 --> 44:07.238
Not yet.

44:07.273 --> 44:10.908
Well, this has actually
been fun.

44:12.779 --> 44:16.347
I just wish it didn't need
the "actually," again.

44:17.717 --> 44:21.085
I should get going.

44:21.120 --> 44:23.788
But there's something
we should do first.

44:23.823 --> 44:27.091
Remember we always used
to do this after bike rides?

44:27.126 --> 44:28.926
It brings back good memories.

44:28.961 --> 44:30.027
It does.

44:32.265 --> 44:34.932
I do remember the last time
I was at the bikes.

44:34.967 --> 44:35.733
Okay.

44:35.768 --> 44:37.368
It was that spring
when you pulled

44:37.403 --> 44:39.437
the secret admirer prank on me.

44:39.472 --> 44:42.873
Your last letter said
"my secret admirer"

44:42.909 --> 44:47.578
would meet me at the bike
rentals and reveal himself.

44:47.613 --> 44:50.648
I was so excited, I told
all my friends,

44:50.683 --> 44:55.686
and I waited for hours,
and he never came.

44:55.721 --> 44:57.888
I'm sorry, Jamie.
I... I was...

44:57.924 --> 45:00.224
Max, it's okay.
We were kids.

45:00.259 --> 45:02.259
You know, the funny thing is,

45:02.295 --> 45:04.829
I actually really liked
my secret admirer.

45:06.098 --> 45:08.299
I felt like he liked me too,

45:08.334 --> 45:12.436
despite how mad I was
at you for that,

45:12.472 --> 45:14.538
I actually kept the letters,

45:14.574 --> 45:17.074
and I know it's because,
I don't know,

45:17.109 --> 45:20.211
they meant so much to me.

45:20.246 --> 45:23.447
Where'd you get that material,
anyway?

45:23.483 --> 45:25.449
I wrote it.

45:25.485 --> 45:26.550
No, really.

45:26.586 --> 45:27.384
Come on.

45:27.420 --> 45:30.988
Really, I wrote it.

45:31.023 --> 45:33.624
Well, how'd you come up with it?

45:33.659 --> 45:37.027
I thought of you.

45:37.063 --> 45:39.029
Thought of the look on your face

45:39.065 --> 45:41.732
when you would fall
for the joke.

45:41.767 --> 45:42.800
Yeah, that one.

45:45.271 --> 45:47.705
Bye, Max.

45:55.148 --> 45:55.914
<i>Hey, Renee.</i>

45:55.949 --> 45:57.182
It's Jamie.

45:57.217 --> 46:01.252
I wanted to let you know I'll be
turning in my painting tomorrow.

46:10.163 --> 46:11.796
- Hello.
- Hi.

46:11.832 --> 46:13.698
Come in, I'm just need
to grab my bag.

46:13.734 --> 46:15.567
Sure.

46:16.803 --> 46:19.704
It's a lovely place.

46:19.740 --> 46:20.805
Thanks.

46:22.709 --> 46:23.808
Shall we?

46:23.844 --> 46:25.210
Yes.

46:33.553 --> 46:36.988
I thought we'd check out
this music in the parks event.

46:37.024 --> 46:39.357
Yeah.

46:43.130 --> 46:45.130
You okay?

46:45.165 --> 46:47.098
What's going on?

46:47.134 --> 46:49.167
Yeah.

46:49.202 --> 46:53.204
Just a funny coincidence.

47:02.182 --> 47:04.416
I didn't know they had
live music here.

47:05.419 --> 47:07.585
It's a new monthly arts
and culture series.

47:07.621 --> 47:10.922
Different sponsors bring
in musicians and artists.

47:10.957 --> 47:12.568
I'm thinking of hosting
a painting exhibit

47:12.592 --> 47:14.826
here this summer.

47:14.861 --> 47:17.228
You're going to host it?

47:17.264 --> 47:19.064
I might've buried
the lead a bit,

47:19.099 --> 47:22.600
but I actually head up
an arts foundation.

47:22.636 --> 47:23.268
Really?

47:23.303 --> 47:26.004
The Herman Arts Foundation.

47:26.039 --> 47:29.140
The Herman Arts Foundation?

47:29.176 --> 47:31.976
That sponsors the Cherry Blossom
Art Festival?

47:32.012 --> 47:34.345
Yes, yeah.

47:34.381 --> 47:36.614
The painting I told you
I was finishing

47:36.650 --> 47:39.050
is for the emerging
artist showcase.

47:39.086 --> 47:39.951
Really?

47:39.986 --> 47:41.753
Well, what a small world.

47:41.788 --> 47:43.788
Yeah.

47:43.824 --> 47:47.592
Is there something wrong?

47:47.627 --> 47:53.932
Well, I guess I'm just
wondering if this...

47:53.967 --> 47:55.867
is a conflict of interest?

47:55.902 --> 47:57.936
No, no.

47:57.971 --> 47:59.537
It's... it's a happy
coincidence.

47:59.573 --> 48:01.005
I don't judge the showcase,

48:01.041 --> 48:03.241
I have no effect on the outcome.

48:04.511 --> 48:07.278
I mean, I'll be at the judging
to represent the foundation,

48:07.314 --> 48:10.915
but I have no sway on who wins.

48:10.951 --> 48:14.052
I see.

48:14.087 --> 48:16.354
So you'll be at the judging.

48:16.389 --> 48:18.990
Of course.

48:19.025 --> 48:19.758
What's wrong?

48:19.793 --> 48:21.693
Nothing.

48:21.728 --> 48:26.698
Nothing is wrong.

48:29.136 --> 48:30.513
<i>You are never going to believe
what happened.</i>

48:30.537 --> 48:31.369
<i>What... what's wrong?</i>

48:31.404 --> 48:32.237
<i>How was the date?</i>

48:32.272 --> 48:34.305
Better question is
"who" is the date.

48:34.341 --> 48:37.442
Michael is actually
Michael Herman.

48:37.477 --> 48:40.211
From the Herman Arts Foundation.

48:40.247 --> 48:41.412
No way.

48:41.448 --> 48:42.714
Yes, way.

48:43.884 --> 48:45.461
When I told Renee about
Canvas Creations,

48:45.485 --> 48:47.396
she mentioned the head of
the foundation was interested,

48:47.420 --> 48:50.622
but I didn't realize
that that was Michael.

48:50.657 --> 48:51.256
Ha!

48:51.291 --> 48:53.658
- How funny.
- No, not funny.

48:53.693 --> 48:55.160
Why? Who cares?

48:55.195 --> 48:57.929
So you went on a date.
He's not a judge, right?

48:57.964 --> 49:00.398
No, he... he's not a judge.

49:00.433 --> 49:03.334
- And I won't be a contestant.
- Why not?

49:03.370 --> 49:07.605
Because I can't display a
painting of a shadowy man

49:07.641 --> 49:12.243
giving me the exact rose Michael
gave me standing in front

49:12.279 --> 49:16.381
of the colonnade exactly like
the one he took me on a date

49:16.416 --> 49:18.750
in front of the art exhibition

49:18.785 --> 49:23.621
exactly like the one he plans
on hosting this summer.

49:23.657 --> 49:24.856
Yeah, that's bad.

49:24.891 --> 49:27.225
Yeah.

49:27.260 --> 49:28.326
What am I gonna do?

49:28.361 --> 49:31.830
My painting is due in five days,
and I have nothing.

49:31.865 --> 49:33.031
No, you have something.

49:33.066 --> 49:35.099
What?

49:35.135 --> 49:37.268
You have five days.

49:38.605 --> 49:39.671
Great.

49:40.574 --> 49:42.640
I know I said I would
deliver it today,

49:42.676 --> 49:45.577
but I need a few more days.

49:45.612 --> 49:48.813
Jamie, I need your painting
in four days.

49:48.849 --> 49:49.892
<i>Will you have it finished?</i>

49:49.916 --> 49:50.715
Definitely.

49:50.750 --> 49:52.150
I have already
made waves accepting

49:52.185 --> 49:53.718
your unfinished submission.

49:53.753 --> 49:57.422
<i>Otherwise, I will have to give
your spot to someone else.</i>

49:57.457 --> 49:58.489
I understand.

49:58.525 --> 49:59.858
<i>Okay.</i>

49:59.893 --> 50:02.026
<i>Thank you.</i>

50:14.274 --> 50:15.406
Hi, honey.

50:15.442 --> 50:18.476
I thought we didn't start
construction till next week.

50:18.511 --> 50:19.878
The contractor
had a cancellation,

50:19.913 --> 50:21.579
so he could begin earlier.

50:21.615 --> 50:23.281
That's right.

50:23.316 --> 50:25.850
Dad texted me about that.

50:25.886 --> 50:26.918
Hey, where's Dad?

50:26.953 --> 50:29.487
He's been here with
the workers since 7:00 AM.

50:29.522 --> 50:32.457
So, he just went to get
them lunch.

50:32.492 --> 50:34.726
That is so sweet.

50:34.761 --> 50:36.661
I feel bad.

50:36.696 --> 50:38.630
I mean, I should be the one
here at 7:00 AM,

50:38.665 --> 50:39.976
I should be the one getting
them lunch.

50:40.000 --> 50:40.965
It's okay, honey.

50:41.001 --> 50:44.502
He knows that this is
a hectic time for you.

50:44.537 --> 50:46.938
So, I have been waiting.

50:46.973 --> 50:51.409
Tell me all about Michael.

50:51.444 --> 50:52.543
He's great.

50:52.579 --> 50:58.883
He's... smart, cultured,
very handsome.

51:00.053 --> 51:04.789
I mean, he is literally my
vision board come to life.

51:04.824 --> 51:10.395
Somehow.

51:10.430 --> 51:12.397
I don't know, there's
something missing.

51:12.432 --> 51:18.403
When I first met him,
I got like, fluttery.

51:18.438 --> 51:21.239
And I didn't have
that last night.

51:21.274 --> 51:25.009
I know, there's not always
an immediate connection,

51:25.045 --> 51:26.010
so we're going out again.

51:26.046 --> 51:29.714
He's going to take me
to an art show opening.

51:29.749 --> 51:33.284
So, I think it just takes time.

51:33.320 --> 51:34.320
Jamie?

51:35.255 --> 51:38.456
You shouldn't have
to convince yourself.

51:47.100 --> 51:48.199
Who is it?

51:48.234 --> 51:50.635
<i>It's me.</i>

51:50.670 --> 51:52.870
Come in.

51:52.906 --> 51:54.872
- Hi.
- Hi.

51:54.908 --> 51:55.985
I just made a bunch of cookies,

51:56.009 --> 51:58.376
and I figured I'd better get
them out of my apartment

51:58.411 --> 52:00.745
before I eat them all
and I thought of you.

52:00.780 --> 52:04.882
Well, that is very... sweet.

52:07.354 --> 52:09.721
Is this your painting
for the showcase?

52:09.756 --> 52:10.722
Yeah.

52:10.757 --> 52:13.191
Can I see it?

52:15.095 --> 52:18.997
It's very... minimalist.

52:20.467 --> 52:21.766
Okay, what happened?

52:21.801 --> 52:22.912
I thought you were almost
done this.

52:22.936 --> 52:29.268
Well, long story short,
be careful what you wish for.

52:30.310 --> 52:34.679
My last painting went... awry,

52:34.714 --> 52:36.781
and instead of taking it
as a sign

52:36.816 --> 52:43.234
I should give up on art, I've
never wanted to paint more.

52:43.456 --> 52:46.090
That's great.

52:46.126 --> 52:47.992
No, but I have a blank canvas.

52:48.028 --> 52:51.295
Well, what would you tell
one of your students?

52:55.301 --> 53:00.872
I would tell them...
not to focus on making,

53:00.907 --> 53:02.940
but on feeling.

53:02.976 --> 53:07.645
I would tell them to have fun.

53:07.680 --> 53:10.882
I would tell them be playful.

53:15.221 --> 53:16.654
Yeah.

53:23.029 --> 53:25.663
That was playful, no?

53:25.698 --> 53:28.433
You didn't.

53:28.468 --> 53:30.068
I did.

53:40.847 --> 53:41.847
Okay.

53:48.388 --> 53:49.454
Ooh.

53:52.592 --> 53:53.191
All right.

53:53.226 --> 53:55.293
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

53:55.328 --> 53:56.761
I dare you.

53:56.796 --> 53:57.528
It's comin'.

53:57.564 --> 53:59.097
- Go for it.
- It's comin'.

53:59.132 --> 54:00.172
- It's coming!
- Go for it!

54:03.636 --> 54:05.670
Nice try.

54:05.705 --> 54:08.506
I should get back to work.

54:08.541 --> 54:11.576
Okay.

54:11.611 --> 54:15.446
But thank you for the cookies.

54:15.482 --> 54:17.115
No problem.

54:29.395 --> 54:31.529
<i>I like this.</i>

54:31.564 --> 54:32.763
<i>Gorgeous.</i>

54:32.799 --> 54:34.232
Hi.

54:34.267 --> 54:35.366
After you.

54:35.401 --> 54:36.234
Thank you.

54:36.269 --> 54:39.203
Thank you, thanks.

54:39.239 --> 54:42.039
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

54:43.743 --> 54:47.245
There's some curators I want
you to show your work too.

54:47.280 --> 54:48.880
I don't think
I'm ready for that.

54:48.915 --> 54:50.248
Of course you are.

54:50.283 --> 54:54.385
I have no doubt you'll stun them
with your talent.

54:54.420 --> 54:56.754
Well, that's very sweet,

54:56.789 --> 55:01.192
but first I actually have to
have something to show them.

55:01.227 --> 55:03.060
What about your
showcase submission?

55:03.096 --> 55:04.562
I thought you were
almost finished.

55:04.597 --> 55:08.533
There was a... hiccup?

55:08.568 --> 55:12.203
That hiccup sounds stressful.

55:12.238 --> 55:15.306
It is, it's a stressful time.

55:15.341 --> 55:18.576
I had to start over on my
painting while also teaching,

55:18.611 --> 55:23.314
and working with my dad to open
another Canvas Creations.

55:23.349 --> 55:25.516
We're looking to franchise,
so it's...

55:25.552 --> 55:26.984
That's incredible.

55:27.020 --> 55:27.985
You think?

55:28.021 --> 55:29.220
Of course.

55:29.255 --> 55:31.622
It'll be a steady source of
income that gives you security.

55:31.658 --> 55:33.791
Yeah, that's true.

55:33.826 --> 55:37.328
But I mean, the expansion means
I won't have any time to paint.

55:37.363 --> 55:40.164
Now, maybe, but it's
a short-term sacrifice

55:40.200 --> 55:42.600
for a long-term gain.

55:42.635 --> 55:46.404
And you can paint on the side,
right?

55:46.439 --> 55:50.508
Yeah, but I'm a painter,
not a paint on the side-er.

55:50.543 --> 55:52.243
Yes, but...

55:52.278 --> 55:57.281
Art as a living, it's an
uncertain future, as you know.

55:57.317 --> 56:00.151
I'm not saying you should
give up on painting,

56:00.186 --> 56:03.154
but I know how difficult
the art world is,

56:03.189 --> 56:07.692
and it's good to have
a backup plan.

56:07.727 --> 56:09.460
Should we see the work?

56:12.498 --> 56:13.631
Hi.

56:20.506 --> 56:23.507
Well, thank you for bringing me.

56:23.543 --> 56:27.912
Thank you for coming.

56:27.947 --> 56:31.515
Michael, I think
you're wonderful,

56:31.551 --> 56:37.221
and I've really enjoyed
our time together, but...

56:37.257 --> 56:38.422
But...

56:38.458 --> 56:41.425
You're using the past tense.

56:41.461 --> 56:43.461
I mean, we have so much
in common,

56:43.496 --> 56:48.799
it seems like we'd be perfect,
and yet somehow,

56:48.835 --> 56:54.138
I just don't think
we're the right match.

56:54.173 --> 57:00.329
But I'd still love to teach you,
if that's something you want.

57:02.548 --> 57:08.352
I'll... give it some thought.

57:08.388 --> 57:11.055
Okay.

57:17.230 --> 57:20.298
You never stop.

57:20.333 --> 57:23.668
Well, there is a special magic
to night gardening.

57:23.703 --> 57:28.153
The flowering plants come out,
the jasmine.

57:29.976 --> 57:31.642
I'm glad I caught you.

57:31.678 --> 57:33.277
I have something for you.

57:33.313 --> 57:35.112
Come on.

57:38.051 --> 57:39.784
Wait here one second.

57:39.819 --> 57:40.985
Okay.

57:46.559 --> 57:50.695
For your inspiration.

57:50.730 --> 57:54.732
And if, that doesn't work,
my microbrew.

57:57.770 --> 58:00.004
Thank you.

58:00.039 --> 58:00.971
No problem.

58:01.007 --> 58:02.573
It's very sweet.

58:02.608 --> 58:03.674
Thanks.

58:06.279 --> 58:09.980
Goodnight, Jamie.

58:10.016 --> 58:11.949
Goodnight, Max.

59:26.459 --> 59:27.825
Hey, Dad.

59:27.860 --> 59:28.659
Hi, honey.

59:28.694 --> 59:31.195
Just wondering if you're
on your way.

59:31.230 --> 59:34.498
We were supposed to pick
out paint today...

59:34.533 --> 59:36.333
I'm actually already
back at the studio.

59:36.368 --> 59:38.135
Dad, I am so sorry.

59:38.170 --> 59:39.737
My piece is due in three days,

59:39.772 --> 59:41.872
and I was up all night
working on it, I...

59:43.876 --> 59:45.676
I completely forgot
we were meeting.

59:45.711 --> 59:48.879
That's... that's okay, we can
pick out paint some other day.

59:48.914 --> 59:51.048
But Jamie...

59:52.852 --> 59:55.819
<i>Good luck with your piece.</i>

59:55.855 --> 59:57.755
Thank you.

01:00:09.602 --> 01:00:10.634
Okay...

01:00:10.669 --> 01:00:12.269
I come bearing cake!

01:00:12.304 --> 01:00:14.371
Thank you so much
for picking it up.

01:00:14.406 --> 01:00:15.739
You're welcome.

01:00:15.775 --> 01:00:17.441
Cute!

01:00:17.476 --> 01:00:21.345
Hey, you have not texted me back
since your date with Michael,

01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:22.780
are you hiding something?

01:00:22.815 --> 01:00:24.915
Well, actually...

01:00:27.987 --> 01:00:28.819
Hi.

01:00:28.854 --> 01:00:30.821
Hey, guys.

01:00:30.856 --> 01:00:31.822
Hey.

01:00:31.857 --> 01:00:32.890
Hi.

01:00:32.925 --> 01:00:36.593
Thank you for picking up
the extra cupcakes.

01:00:36.629 --> 01:00:38.128
No problem.

01:00:42.468 --> 01:00:44.968
So, what do you think?

01:00:48.073 --> 01:00:49.173
Hi.

01:00:49.208 --> 01:00:51.441
Your daughter is so talented.

01:00:51.477 --> 01:00:52.776
Miss Jamie!

01:00:52.812 --> 01:00:54.311
Yes.

01:00:54.346 --> 01:00:55.379
Hi.

01:00:55.414 --> 01:00:56.647
I finished in time.

01:00:57.817 --> 01:00:59.449
I knew you could do it.

01:00:59.485 --> 01:01:02.319
I'm so proud of you!

01:01:02.354 --> 01:01:03.720
Thank you so much.

01:01:03.756 --> 01:01:06.290
Of course.

01:01:12.631 --> 01:01:14.231
So.

01:01:14.266 --> 01:01:15.866
What do you think?

01:01:17.002 --> 01:01:18.079
Well, I think it's safe to say
this is an occasion

01:01:18.103 --> 01:01:22.039
where you can say even a kid
could've done this one.

01:01:22.074 --> 01:01:23.040
Ha ha.

01:01:23.075 --> 01:01:24.341
Kidding.

01:01:24.376 --> 01:01:26.610
It's great.

01:01:26.645 --> 01:01:28.912
They're lucky to have you
as a teacher.

01:01:28.948 --> 01:01:32.449
Well, vice versa.

01:01:39.625 --> 01:01:41.558
Excuse me.

01:01:41.594 --> 01:01:42.359
Is that Michael?

01:01:42.394 --> 01:01:44.661
Yeah, I didn't know
he was coming.

01:01:44.697 --> 01:01:47.064
Hi.

01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:51.401
Well, I'm glad you decided
to show your work.

01:01:51.437 --> 01:01:54.805
I decided it's good to put
myself out there.

01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:58.642
Even if I don't get
the reception I hoped for.

01:01:58.677 --> 01:02:00.677
Jamie, I won't try to pretend.

01:02:00.713 --> 01:02:02.145
I like you.

01:02:02.181 --> 01:02:07.317
I was hoping we'd have a future,
but I know that,

01:02:07.353 --> 01:02:13.223
like with painting, what matters
is how it feels.

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:15.926
Who is that?

01:02:15.961 --> 01:02:18.195
That's Jamie's dream man.

01:02:18.797 --> 01:02:20.597
Wait, wait, who...
who is that?

01:02:20.633 --> 01:02:24.635
His name is Michael, he runs
the arts festival.

01:02:24.670 --> 01:02:26.370
Jamie's dating him.

01:02:26.405 --> 01:02:27.271
What?

01:02:27.306 --> 01:02:30.207
I'm sorry, Max.
I didn't want you to get hurt.

01:02:30.242 --> 01:02:31.475
Why would I get hurt?

01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:35.245
Come on, you have a thing for Jamie.
You always had a thing for Jamie.

01:02:35.281 --> 01:02:38.115
A thing?

01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:43.120
Well, what is the right word for
15 years of unspoken feelings?

01:02:43.155 --> 01:02:46.356
Max, maybe it's time
to speak those feelings.

01:02:46.392 --> 01:02:47.702
Because we saw you
and Jamie before,

01:02:47.726 --> 01:02:50.260
and it looks like
she feels it too.

01:02:50.296 --> 01:02:52.329
Yeah, I gotta go.

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:57.067
Baby steps.

01:03:06.645 --> 01:03:07.911
Hey...

01:03:07.947 --> 01:03:09.313
You hungry?

01:03:09.348 --> 01:03:11.949
I made dinner.

01:03:11.984 --> 01:03:13.917
I could eat.

01:03:15.554 --> 01:03:20.223
Your apartment is so...
nice.

01:03:20.259 --> 01:03:23.093
I'll try not to be offended
by how surprised you sound.

01:03:24.063 --> 01:03:24.995
I thought that you shouldn't
have to wait

01:03:25.030 --> 01:03:29.299
till your show in Paris
to eat French Food.

01:03:30.436 --> 01:03:33.503
Well, I have no idea how
I'll possibly win that show,

01:03:33.539 --> 01:03:36.873
but thank you.

01:03:36.909 --> 01:03:38.008
You know how to stir?

01:03:38.043 --> 01:03:41.945
Stirring is about the limit
of my culinary talents.

01:03:41.981 --> 01:03:43.213
Well, at least you have that.

01:03:46.819 --> 01:03:48.318
I didn't know you cooked.

01:03:48.354 --> 01:03:49.553
Yeah, you know.

01:03:49.588 --> 01:03:51.488
I dabble.

01:03:51.523 --> 01:03:54.891
Tonight I made a Parisian dish
called Pommes Aligot.

01:03:56.095 --> 01:03:57.794
It's just a fancy way of saying

01:03:57.830 --> 01:04:00.097
"mashed potatoes
with fondue on it".

01:04:01.033 --> 01:04:04.034
So, the French birth
Cezanne and Monet,

01:04:04.069 --> 01:04:09.106
and now their greatest
masterpiece, cheesy potatoes.

01:04:09.141 --> 01:04:11.808
What about their
true masterpiece?

01:04:11.844 --> 01:04:13.910
Monet's water lilies?

01:04:13.946 --> 01:04:17.381
No, French Fries.

01:04:17.416 --> 01:04:19.349
Of course!

01:04:41.306 --> 01:04:46.109
So, I saw you at the
art exhibit talking to...

01:04:46.145 --> 01:04:48.211
Michael.

01:04:48.247 --> 01:04:49.546
Right.

01:04:49.581 --> 01:04:52.082
What's going on between you two?

01:04:52.117 --> 01:04:56.953
Well, I was teaching
him to paint,

01:04:56.989 --> 01:05:04.115
and we went on a date,
and then I ended things.

01:05:06.065 --> 01:05:07.831
Why?

01:05:07.866 --> 01:05:11.101
You know, I'm not sure, exactly.

01:05:11.136 --> 01:05:13.703
But things are over
between you now?

01:05:13.739 --> 01:05:16.006
Yeah.

01:05:17.142 --> 01:05:20.177
Okay.

01:05:20.212 --> 01:05:23.947
Glad to hear that.

01:05:23.982 --> 01:05:25.982
I have something to tell you.

01:05:26.018 --> 01:05:27.050
Okay...

01:05:27.086 --> 01:05:28.185
Remember that whole year

01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:31.088
I pretended to be
your secret admirer?

01:05:32.091 --> 01:05:33.423
I wasn't pretending.

01:05:33.459 --> 01:05:34.891
It wasn't a joke.

01:05:34.927 --> 01:05:38.829
Everything that I wrote
was true.

01:05:38.864 --> 01:05:42.099
That's how I felt.

01:05:42.134 --> 01:05:44.434
I was gonna tell you that day
at the bikes,

01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:49.406
I was there, but when I saw
you, I just,

01:05:49.441 --> 01:05:51.475
I... I chickened out.

01:05:51.510 --> 01:05:56.146
And now I'm here, trying to find
the courage to tell you

01:05:56.181 --> 01:06:03.799
that 15 years later,
I'm still an admirer.

01:06:05.224 --> 01:06:09.759
But I don't want it to be
a secret anymore.

01:06:09.795 --> 01:06:12.829
Jamie, I have feelings for you.

01:06:12.865 --> 01:06:15.599
Ooh.

01:06:15.634 --> 01:06:17.934
Well...

01:06:17.970 --> 01:06:21.004
Thank you for telling me.

01:06:21.039 --> 01:06:23.240
I... I mean I really don't know
what to say,

01:06:23.275 --> 01:06:28.011
I... spending time
with you has been great,

01:06:28.046 --> 01:06:36.219
but Max, I worry that next week,
you'll be interested

01:06:36.255 --> 01:06:41.458
in someplace else,
something else, someone else.

01:06:41.493 --> 01:06:42.592
I mean, I know you.

01:06:42.628 --> 01:06:43.628
Don't... no.

01:06:45.531 --> 01:06:50.033
You think you know me, but this?

01:06:50.068 --> 01:06:53.403
This is who I am.

01:06:53.438 --> 01:06:55.572
Someone who wants
to be with you,

01:06:55.607 --> 01:06:58.575
someone who always has.

01:07:03.815 --> 01:07:06.550
Can I think about it?

01:07:06.585 --> 01:07:11.521
These cheesy potatoes are
not gonna eat themselves.

01:07:11.557 --> 01:07:15.659
Bon Appetit?

01:07:40.152 --> 01:07:43.687
So, Sundance or Golden Light?

01:07:43.722 --> 01:07:47.490
Well, they're both great.

01:07:47.526 --> 01:07:48.625
You decide.

01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:51.861
I've never known you to be
laissez-faire about paint.

01:07:51.897 --> 01:07:54.531
Dad, they're both good options.

01:07:54.566 --> 01:07:56.266
You don't like either?

01:07:56.301 --> 01:07:59.569
I think I have some samples
in the back.

01:08:05.477 --> 01:08:07.577
I finished my painting.

01:08:07.613 --> 01:08:09.179
That's wonderful.

01:08:09.214 --> 01:08:14.451
And as soon as I did, I felt
like I wanna start another one.

01:08:14.486 --> 01:08:20.290
And that made me realize
I want to be painting,

01:08:20.325 --> 01:08:24.627
and on my breaks from painting,
teaching.

01:08:24.662 --> 01:08:27.063
I don't want to be running
a big business,

01:08:27.099 --> 01:08:29.666
I don't want to be hiring,
or marketing.

01:08:29.701 --> 01:08:31.334
So, tell your dad.

01:08:31.370 --> 01:08:32.902
But he's so excited.

01:08:32.938 --> 01:08:35.337
I mean, I haven't seen him
this happy in years.

01:08:35.374 --> 01:08:40.042
Plus, we have sunk so much
time and money into this place,

01:08:40.078 --> 01:08:45.415
it just, it, I mean, it feels wrong
to consider pulling away, but...

01:08:48.319 --> 01:08:52.455
it feels worse to keep going
knowing every minute I'd be here,

01:08:52.491 --> 01:08:54.624
I would want to be painting.

01:08:56.161 --> 01:08:59.395
I found the samples.

01:09:02.934 --> 01:09:04.934
Great.

01:09:11.777 --> 01:09:13.276
Oh, Jamie.

01:09:13.312 --> 01:09:15.278
Please tell me you have
some good news.

01:09:15.314 --> 01:09:16.412
Yes.

01:09:16.448 --> 01:09:18.014
I finished this morning.

01:09:18.050 --> 01:09:22.652
Full disclosure, it's not the
painting you approved, but...

01:09:22.688 --> 01:09:26.622
Renee, I think it is
so much better.

01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:31.627
Here's a picture.

01:09:39.304 --> 01:09:41.504
And you'll have this delivered
to me by tonight?

01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:44.441
Yes, tonight.

01:09:48.913 --> 01:09:50.714
Excuse me.

01:09:50.749 --> 01:09:52.115
Thank you.

01:09:52.149 --> 01:09:54.351
Thank you so much.

01:09:56.188 --> 01:09:57.188
Thanks.

01:09:57.956 --> 01:09:59.155
Why are you avoiding me?

01:09:59.191 --> 01:10:00.123
I'm not avoiding you.

01:10:00.158 --> 01:10:03.026
Yes you are since your date
with Michael.

01:10:03.061 --> 01:10:03.793
What happened?

01:10:03.829 --> 01:10:04.561
Did you elope?

01:10:04.596 --> 01:10:05.995
No.

01:10:06.031 --> 01:10:09.099
The date was fine,
Michael likes me,

01:10:09.134 --> 01:10:12.102
he expressed he'd hoped
we'd have a future.

01:10:12.137 --> 01:10:14.671
Why do I feel like I should
hold the confetti?

01:10:14.706 --> 01:10:15.805
Because I ended it?

01:10:15.841 --> 01:10:16.973
What? Why?

01:10:17.008 --> 01:10:18.641
Because I'm falling for Max.

01:10:18.677 --> 01:10:19.609
Oh, Jamie.

01:10:19.644 --> 01:10:21.322
You know I love Max,
but you know how Max is,

01:10:21.346 --> 01:10:22.712
he can't commit to anything.

01:10:22.748 --> 01:10:23.980
I know.

01:10:24.015 --> 01:10:26.060
Michael seemed so perfect and
he was talking about a future?

01:10:26.084 --> 01:10:28.218
Again, I know.

01:10:28.253 --> 01:10:29.285
It makes no sense.

01:10:29.321 --> 01:10:31.265
You painted that whole
vision board about Michael,

01:10:31.289 --> 01:10:32.956
I mean that has
to mean something.

01:10:32.991 --> 01:10:38.294
I think it means that in
painting what I thought I want,

01:10:38.330 --> 01:10:40.864
I realized what I need.

01:10:40.899 --> 01:10:45.101
I just don't want you or Max
to get hurt.

01:10:45.137 --> 01:10:47.670
I don't either.

01:10:47.706 --> 01:10:49.105
I have to go.

01:10:49.141 --> 01:10:50.673
Dinner tonight?

01:10:50.709 --> 01:10:51.808
Yeah.

01:10:51.843 --> 01:10:55.478
Tom and I are going to
Patricio's for pizza with Max.

01:10:55.514 --> 01:10:59.149
I guess we can double date now.

01:10:59.184 --> 01:11:00.083
Okay, bye.

01:11:00.118 --> 01:11:01.785
Bye.

01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:03.753
Perfect. Yes.

01:11:04.990 --> 01:11:06.022
Thank you.

01:11:06.057 --> 01:11:07.057
Hi.

01:11:07.926 --> 01:11:08.926
Hi.

01:11:10.862 --> 01:11:12.395
Jamie just left.

01:11:12.431 --> 01:11:13.431
Really?

01:11:14.032 --> 01:11:14.864
Sad I missed her.

01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:15.665
I bet you are.

01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:17.233
I bet I am.

01:11:17.269 --> 01:11:19.836
She told me something's been
going on between the two of you.

01:11:19.871 --> 01:11:21.905
What did she say?

01:11:21.940 --> 01:11:23.406
Look, Max, you know I love you,

01:11:23.442 --> 01:11:26.242
and I think you're all these
amazing things,

01:11:26.278 --> 01:11:29.813
but I don't want you to sweep Jamie off
her feet into some whirlwind romance,

01:11:29.848 --> 01:11:33.450
and then two months from now,
just up and leave her.

01:11:33.485 --> 01:11:34.551
I would never do that.

01:11:34.586 --> 01:11:35.552
Are you sure?

01:11:35.587 --> 01:11:37.887
Because you don't have
the best track record.

01:11:37.923 --> 01:11:38.788
Yeah, I know, but...

01:11:38.824 --> 01:11:39.867
You never thought
you could have her,

01:11:39.891 --> 01:11:41.991
so you didn't have to take
your feelings seriously

01:11:42.027 --> 01:11:43.660
to actually commit.

01:11:43.695 --> 01:11:46.763
And Jamie deserves someone
who can commit,

01:11:46.798 --> 01:11:48.631
and she was just dating
someone who wanted to,

01:11:48.667 --> 01:11:53.269
and she broke it off with him
to be with you.

01:11:53.305 --> 01:11:57.907
Just, don't hurt her.

01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:10.220
Hey, neighbour.

01:12:10.255 --> 01:12:11.154
Hey.

01:12:11.189 --> 01:12:12.255
Are you free?

01:12:12.290 --> 01:12:15.625
I want to show you my painting
before I turn it in.

01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:16.793
Actually, I'm not.

01:12:16.828 --> 01:12:18.161
I have something to do
with work.

01:12:18.196 --> 01:12:19.128
Work?

01:12:19.164 --> 01:12:20.164
Yeah.

01:12:20.899 --> 01:12:23.399
Okay, Max, what's going on?

01:12:23.435 --> 01:12:28.905
Jamie, I... I think you
should be with Michael.

01:12:28.940 --> 01:12:32.809
Are you... joking?

01:12:32.844 --> 01:12:34.277
No.

01:12:34.312 --> 01:12:36.079
Look, we both know
that you deserve someone

01:12:36.114 --> 01:12:38.448
who can give you everything.

01:12:38.483 --> 01:12:39.549
Someone who can commit.

01:12:39.584 --> 01:12:44.053
Okay, well I didn't ask you,
or anyone, to commit.

01:12:44.089 --> 01:12:47.524
But it's really good to know
you still can't.

01:12:49.094 --> 01:12:51.294
I mean Max, you pursued me.

01:12:51.329 --> 01:12:53.229
You told me that you
had feelings for me,

01:12:53.265 --> 01:12:55.798
you always have, and now
I have feelings for you,

01:12:55.834 --> 01:12:57.600
and you're pulling away?

01:12:57.636 --> 01:12:59.736
Why, because you're so scared

01:12:59.771 --> 01:13:03.106
of anything even remotely
resembling commitment?

01:13:03.141 --> 01:13:06.910
No, 'cause I want you
to be happy.

01:13:06.945 --> 01:13:09.846
No, that is not why.

01:13:09.881 --> 01:13:13.716
It's because this
is who you are.

01:13:13.752 --> 01:13:17.921
You get so excited about
something or someone,

01:13:17.956 --> 01:13:21.925
and then the second it stops
being fun and starts being real,

01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:23.826
you just get scared.

01:13:23.862 --> 01:13:24.894
And run away.

01:13:24.930 --> 01:13:27.797
You talk a big game
about following your heart,

01:13:27.832 --> 01:13:30.767
and living with no regret,
and the truth is,

01:13:30.802 --> 01:13:36.806
that is either all talk,
or when it comes to us,

01:13:36.841 --> 01:13:41.477
there is just no heart,

01:13:41.513 --> 01:13:43.613
and no regret.

01:13:48.353 --> 01:13:51.921
So I guess it's true then.

01:13:51.957 --> 01:13:58.074
Every time I'm around you
I get hurt and humiliated.

01:15:07.298 --> 01:15:08.798
<i>"Hi Jamie. It's Renee.</i>

01:15:08.833 --> 01:15:12.702
<i>"I needed your piece last night,
and so I have no option</i>

01:15:12.737 --> 01:15:15.905
<i>"but to replace your painting.</i>

01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:18.141
<i>"I'm sorry".</i>

01:15:40.398 --> 01:15:42.165
Honey, we've been trying
to call you.

01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:43.633
Jamie, what's going on?

01:15:43.668 --> 01:15:46.969
What's going on is I lost
my place in the showcase,

01:15:47.005 --> 01:15:48.905
and I am not gonna win
the show in Paris,

01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:52.575
and I have no idea what my future
as a professional artist looks like,

01:15:52.610 --> 01:15:56.379
but even with all of that,

01:15:56.414 --> 01:15:59.649
I still don't want to give up
on painting.

01:15:59.684 --> 01:16:01.350
Dad, I'm sorry.

01:16:01.386 --> 01:16:03.853
I know this entire expansion
was my idea,

01:16:03.888 --> 01:16:08.357
and you're trying to help,
but I just want to paint,

01:16:08.393 --> 01:16:09.826
and then teach when I can.

01:16:09.861 --> 01:16:10.927
I know you do.

01:16:10.962 --> 01:16:12.628
Glad you realized it, too.

01:16:12.664 --> 01:16:15.531
Wait, you knew?

01:16:15.567 --> 01:16:16.877
Well then, why didn't
you tell me?

01:16:16.901 --> 01:16:18.501
You had to figure it out
on your own.

01:16:18.536 --> 01:16:22.839
I'm just glad you did it now,
and not 20 years from now.

01:16:24.609 --> 01:16:25.942
I'm sorry.

01:16:25.977 --> 01:16:28.244
Don't be sorry, even doing
just this was fun,

01:16:28.279 --> 01:16:30.847
it gave me a reason to get
out of bed in the morning.

01:16:30.882 --> 01:16:32.682
You mean other than your wife?

01:16:32.717 --> 01:16:33.816
And daughter.

01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:39.489
I'll find something else to do.

01:16:39.524 --> 01:16:43.292
You know, Dad, you
want me to be happy,

01:16:43.328 --> 01:16:48.564
and I want you to be happy too.

01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:51.434
Do you love this?

01:16:51.469 --> 01:16:52.869
If I helped get it running,

01:16:52.904 --> 01:16:57.039
and consulted as an artist
in residence,

01:16:57.075 --> 01:16:59.942
could you continue without me
and run the business?

01:16:59.978 --> 01:17:03.312
Is that something
you'd want to do?

01:17:03.348 --> 01:17:04.380
Definitely.

01:17:04.415 --> 01:17:05.982
Then yes.

01:17:06.017 --> 01:17:08.951
I mean, it... it'll be
hard without you...

01:17:08.987 --> 01:17:09.852
Yeah.

01:17:09.888 --> 01:17:11.065
But I'll be happy knowing
you're doing

01:17:11.089 --> 01:17:12.688
exactly what you
should be doing.

01:17:14.826 --> 01:17:17.927
But Jamie, how did you lose
your spot in the showcase?

01:17:17.962 --> 01:17:21.597
I messed up my painting.

01:17:21.633 --> 01:17:22.698
And you can't fix it?

01:17:22.734 --> 01:17:23.734
No.

01:17:26.704 --> 01:17:32.008
But, maybe I could start over.

01:18:43.649 --> 01:18:45.315
You're here.
I thought you lost your spot.

01:18:45.351 --> 01:18:47.451
I did, and I have no idea
if this will work,

01:18:47.486 --> 01:18:50.153
but I will be back.

01:18:50.189 --> 01:18:52.256
Okay.

01:18:52.291 --> 01:18:53.323
Renee?

01:18:53.359 --> 01:18:54.224
Jamie.

01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:55.826
I had to give your spot
to someone else.

01:18:55.861 --> 01:18:58.962
I know, and I completely
understand.

01:18:58.998 --> 01:19:00.364
But.

01:19:00.399 --> 01:19:02.299
I have just poured
my heart into this,

01:19:02.334 --> 01:19:07.404
and I was... I was just hoping
you could...

01:19:09.141 --> 01:19:11.341
Thank you.

01:19:16.749 --> 01:19:22.019
I can't put this
in the showcase.

01:19:22.054 --> 01:19:23.887
It wouldn't be fair.

01:19:23.923 --> 01:19:24.855
I understand.

01:19:24.890 --> 01:19:27.257
But we can still show this.

01:19:27.293 --> 01:19:29.793
You can?

01:19:29.828 --> 01:19:31.361
How?

01:19:31.397 --> 01:19:32.462
You'll see.

01:19:32.498 --> 01:19:34.631
Leave it to me.

01:19:40.539 --> 01:19:41.471
Where have you been?

01:19:41.507 --> 01:19:42.639
I've called a hundred times.

01:19:42.675 --> 01:19:44.007
I know, I'm sorry.

01:19:44.043 --> 01:19:48.045
Long story short, right
after I told you about Max,

01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:53.317
he in typical Max fashion,
lost interest and broke it off,

01:19:53.352 --> 01:19:55.652
and he said he thought
I'd be better dating Michael.

01:19:55.688 --> 01:19:57.154
- Oh no.
- Oh yes.

01:19:57.189 --> 01:20:00.057
No, that's not what happened.

01:20:00.092 --> 01:20:03.293
I gave Max a talking to, and
I might've been a little harsh,

01:20:03.329 --> 01:20:06.663
and said that Michael
was what was best for you.

01:20:06.699 --> 01:20:07.898
What?

01:20:07.933 --> 01:20:11.969
I'm sorry, I had
good intentions.

01:20:12.521 --> 01:20:18.709
So... Max backed off because
he wanted what was best for me?

01:20:19.845 --> 01:20:21.878
And he thought that was Michael?

01:20:21.914 --> 01:20:22.980
Yeah.

01:20:23.015 --> 01:20:24.081
Ava, look.

01:20:24.116 --> 01:20:27.150
I know Max and I
do not make sense.

01:20:27.186 --> 01:20:30.387
But when I'm with him,

01:20:30.422 --> 01:20:33.423
I feel like I do when
I'm painting,

01:20:33.459 --> 01:20:37.294
you know like, like
it's where I should be.

01:20:37.329 --> 01:20:40.230
It's all I've ever wanted
for you.

01:20:40.265 --> 01:20:41.865
Thank you.

01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:46.036
But maybe next time just like,
a little less meddling.

01:20:46.071 --> 01:20:47.170
Deal.

01:20:48.774 --> 01:20:52.642
Besides, you would make
the best sister in law.

01:20:54.113 --> 01:20:55.612
Or aunt.

01:20:55.647 --> 01:20:58.648
You're pregnant!

01:20:58.684 --> 01:20:59.883
It's still early.

01:21:00.919 --> 01:21:02.519
Congratulations!

01:21:02.554 --> 01:21:04.388
I'm so happy for you.

01:21:04.423 --> 01:21:08.725
I have a million questions,
I want to hear everything.

01:21:08.761 --> 01:21:09.493
But right now...

01:21:09.528 --> 01:21:10.494
You have to go find Max.

01:21:10.529 --> 01:21:12.195
Yes.

01:21:12.231 --> 01:21:12.996
Is he here?

01:21:13.032 --> 01:21:14.109
Yeah, he's at the gardens,
but...

01:21:14.133 --> 01:21:15.232
Okay.

01:21:15.267 --> 01:21:16.533
Hi, gotta go.
Okay, bye.

01:21:16.568 --> 01:21:19.870
<i>All right everyone, if I could
have your attention please.</i>

01:21:19.905 --> 01:21:21.238
We are about to announce

01:21:21.273 --> 01:21:24.141
our winner of the emerging
artist showcase.

01:21:24.176 --> 01:21:27.744
If I could have my judges
step on stage with me, please.

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:35.886
Max!

01:21:36.422 --> 01:21:37.687
Max!

01:21:37.723 --> 01:21:39.322
I have to talk to you.

01:21:39.358 --> 01:21:41.224
Can it wait a minute?

01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:43.360
I'm sorry, no.

01:21:43.395 --> 01:21:44.561
It can't.

01:21:44.596 --> 01:21:46.641
I'm so sorry, I'm just in
the middle of a job interview.

01:21:46.665 --> 01:21:47.497
Not an interview.

01:21:47.533 --> 01:21:50.200
You know the job's yours
if you want it.

01:21:50.235 --> 01:21:52.969
The landscape
architect position?

01:21:53.005 --> 01:21:55.105
You're staying?

01:21:55.140 --> 01:21:56.173
Gimme a minute?

01:21:58.310 --> 01:21:59.576
Yes.

01:21:59.611 --> 01:22:02.479
Someone wise, who apparently
knows how I should be

01:22:02.514 --> 01:22:04.714
living my life more than I do,

01:22:04.750 --> 01:22:08.819
told me that not committing
comes with regrets of its own.

01:22:08.854 --> 01:22:12.589
And you were right, I
would regret giving up.

01:22:12.624 --> 01:22:14.424
I would regret running
when I was scared,

01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:16.393
I would regret not giving myself
a chance

01:22:16.428 --> 01:22:20.363
to see who I could really be.

01:22:20.399 --> 01:22:24.301
Most of all, I would regret
not doing everything I can

01:22:24.336 --> 01:22:27.204
to be with you.

01:22:32.845 --> 01:22:34.845
Hold that thought.

01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:36.213
My painting's being displayed,

01:22:36.248 --> 01:22:39.583
and I really want to show you.

01:22:47.192 --> 01:22:48.425
<i>Jamie.</i>

01:22:51.497 --> 01:22:52.996
Go.

01:22:59.638 --> 01:23:00.871
Renee.

01:23:00.906 --> 01:23:03.707
After the art festival,
I want you to find me,

01:23:03.742 --> 01:23:07.177
so I can talk
about a group show.

01:23:12.751 --> 01:23:13.917
Wha...

01:23:16.321 --> 01:23:19.256
It's beautiful.

01:23:20.325 --> 01:23:24.861
Now, aren't you glad you took
my advice and committed?

01:23:24.897 --> 01:23:29.166
You know, you are
still exasperating.

01:23:32.771 --> 01:23:34.704
You're still smiling.
