WEBVTT

00:11.862 --> 00:13.440
I don't understand.

00:14.890 --> 00:16.970
They've been destabilized.

00:17.243 --> 00:18.252
I have everything...

00:18.276 --> 00:19.308
- Shut up.

00:19.386 --> 00:21.353
You'll not repeat that.

00:23.632 --> 00:25.524
- Give us the room.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.618
- I've seen dead people before,
you know.

00:33.642 --> 00:35.242
- Indeed.
- Mm.

00:35.803 --> 00:38.363
Falls from a great height,
by bullets,

00:38.438 --> 00:40.917
knives, disintegration.

00:40.941 --> 00:43.533
- Counselor.
- Hmm?

00:43.610 --> 00:45.044
- If I may.

00:50.301 --> 00:52.793
- I told him to act his level,

00:52.869 --> 00:57.181
and I, uh... I think he, um...

00:59.185 --> 01:03.261
It was my fault.
- No, it's mine.

01:03.338 --> 01:04.563
I let the savage in.

01:06.767 --> 01:08.192
- It's his fault.

01:13.348 --> 01:14.773
- Is it over now, Indra's test?

01:14.850 --> 01:16.075
- No.

01:18.812 --> 01:20.153
- What does that mean?

01:20.230 --> 01:21.905
- It means we need
to stop the savage

01:21.982 --> 01:23.310
before this goes too far.

01:23.334 --> 01:25.084
There isn't much time.

01:27.612 --> 01:28.912
Director.

03:23.403 --> 03:24.973
- You're going to feel
so much better.

03:36.449 --> 03:38.970
- You're just sitting there
as if it never happened.

03:38.994 --> 03:41.345
Everyone knows what you did.

03:41.421 --> 03:43.046
- Excuse me?

03:43.123 --> 03:44.798
- To Frannie.

03:44.874 --> 03:49.052
She just wanted to be like you.
You couldn't stand it.

03:49.129 --> 03:51.513
- Check your levels, Vivian.

03:51.589 --> 03:54.233
- Because there's only one
Lenina Crowne.

03:57.846 --> 03:59.613
- Summon Lenina Crowne.

04:02.767 --> 04:05.443
- She was your friend.
- She's not dead.

04:05.520 --> 04:07.320
- She's being reconditioned.

04:07.397 --> 04:09.447
- I think if anyone
should be reconditioned...

04:09.524 --> 04:10.991
- We're all thinking that.

04:11.067 --> 04:12.729
- Something's very wrong
with her.

04:12.753 --> 04:16.079
- You're destabilizing everyone.

04:16.156 --> 04:18.257
- I do that, don't I?

04:20.076 --> 04:22.043
- Lenina Crowne.

04:22.120 --> 04:23.865
- I'm solipsistic.

04:23.889 --> 04:26.923
Private, sad.
Worst of all, I'm different.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.870
'Cause it isn't enough for me.
Never was.

04:28.894 --> 04:30.872
You go from Soma to Soma
and Alpha to Alpha.

04:30.896 --> 04:33.438
<i>- Lenina Crowne.</i>

04:33.515 --> 04:34.431
- Your parties, your gossips,

04:34.507 --> 04:35.952
your Feelies, your feeds.

04:35.976 --> 04:37.504
Anything to keep yourself
from thinking that...

04:37.528 --> 04:39.644
<i>- Lenina Crowne.</i>
- Shut up.

04:39.721 --> 04:41.771
- You spend
the whole time watching

04:41.848 --> 04:43.459
other people's lives,
you forget to live your own.

04:43.483 --> 04:45.692
<i>- Lenina Crowne.</i>
- Fuck off!

04:47.103 --> 04:48.370
- Lenina!

04:49.439 --> 04:51.415
- She wouldn't dare.

04:53.693 --> 04:55.355
<i>Lenina...</i>

05:06.456 --> 05:07.931
- Not me.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.686
Ah!

05:46.913 --> 05:49.089
- Good morning, Director.
- Oh, thank you.

05:49.165 --> 05:51.549
- Dr. Marx.
Congratulations.

05:51.626 --> 05:52.645
- Thank you so much.

05:52.669 --> 05:54.105
Um, hold that thought, actually.

05:54.129 --> 05:55.687
Both: Dr. Marx, Hi!

05:56.923 --> 05:58.848
- Lenina!

05:58.925 --> 06:00.850
Lenina!

06:00.927 --> 06:02.435
There you are.

06:02.512 --> 06:04.966
I'm not sure if you, um...
I-I summoned you.

06:04.990 --> 06:06.242
- I know.

06:06.266 --> 06:07.491
- What happened to your optic?

06:07.567 --> 06:08.992
- It broke.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.485
- They don't break.

06:10.562 --> 06:11.861
- They do if you step on them.

06:11.938 --> 06:13.549
- Oh, well, we'll get you
another one.

06:13.573 --> 06:14.853
Sorry, could you slow down?

06:14.899 --> 06:16.449
- Not really.

06:16.526 --> 06:17.753
- No, I've been busy too.

06:17.777 --> 06:19.452
I've just been made Director.

06:19.529 --> 06:21.079
- Director?

06:21.156 --> 06:23.081
- Yeah.

06:23.158 --> 06:25.875
- What about Henry?

06:25.952 --> 06:26.952
- Oh, you don't...

06:29.122 --> 06:31.506
You didn't hear?

06:31.583 --> 06:34.592
Henry had an accident.

06:34.669 --> 06:37.396
- Is it serious?
Is Henry all right?

06:44.220 --> 06:45.737
- Director.

06:52.112 --> 06:55.238
- It happened to me too.

06:55.315 --> 06:58.458
The feeling.
It's unsettling.

06:59.944 --> 07:01.586
Unexpected.

07:05.033 --> 07:07.709
- He's gone and no one even...
- You can't blame them.

07:07.785 --> 07:09.088
It's such a rare thing,
an unnatural death.

07:09.112 --> 07:11.555
They don't know how to...
- They've never seen it.

07:11.631 --> 07:14.891
- Precisely.
Unlike us, of course.

07:19.297 --> 07:21.857
I suppose we'll always be a bit
different from the others now.

07:25.070 --> 07:29.063
I've been thinking about it,
the other night when we...

07:29.140 --> 07:31.577
I suppose what I was...
Um, what I'd like to say is...

07:31.601 --> 07:32.681
- Oh, hello, Director.

07:34.771 --> 07:35.873
- Well, there's no reason
why an Alpha

07:35.897 --> 07:38.457
and a Beta can't be friends.

07:43.321 --> 07:44.537
- I need to go.

07:44.614 --> 07:45.833
- Go?
No, wait, where?

07:45.857 --> 07:48.925
Wait... you're going to him,
aren't you?

07:52.330 --> 07:53.972
I'm not a fool, Lenina.

07:55.750 --> 07:57.851
- Did you do it, Bernard?

08:00.171 --> 08:02.105
Did you take his memories
and put them out there

08:02.182 --> 08:03.732
for everyone to see?

08:05.343 --> 08:06.976
- I was right about him.

08:07.053 --> 08:08.164
He's a killer.

08:08.188 --> 08:10.366
He can't hide.
I won't let him.

08:10.390 --> 08:11.773
- You were his friend.

08:11.849 --> 08:13.858
- He's extremely dangerous,
Lenina.

08:13.935 --> 08:16.069
He's worse than
any of us imagined.

08:16.145 --> 08:17.954
- We all are.

08:21.234 --> 08:22.918
- If you go to him, I...

08:31.803 --> 08:33.843
- Yeah, you think
that's an accident?

08:33.913 --> 08:36.308
- This world is made for Alphas.

08:36.332 --> 08:38.258
There are no accidents.

08:38.334 --> 08:40.813
- Exactly.
This place is poison.

08:40.837 --> 08:41.989
What happened to your friend

08:42.013 --> 08:45.607
happened to me, you, everyone.

08:46.902 --> 08:50.186
See that part that's missing?
That's me.

08:50.263 --> 08:52.605
I don't know how
to get her back.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.679
- Tell us what to do.

08:56.703 --> 08:57.863
- I don't know what to do.

08:57.937 --> 08:59.737
I didn't plan this shit.

08:59.814 --> 09:01.292
I walk outside
and suddenly I'm a killer

09:01.316 --> 09:04.167
and now I'm down here
eating chicken pot pies.

09:04.244 --> 09:06.244
Fuck!

09:06.321 --> 09:07.798
- You spoke.
We listened.

09:07.822 --> 09:09.976
- Yeah, well,
there's your problem.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.276
Don't listen to me, guys.
Just fucking...

09:11.300 --> 09:12.928
- But we did.
You spoke.

09:12.952 --> 09:14.179
We listened.
- It doesn't matter.

09:14.203 --> 09:16.012
- It matters to us!

09:21.210 --> 09:22.885
- What do you...

09:22.962 --> 09:25.305
You don't need me to tell you
how it should be.

09:25.381 --> 09:26.918
You know how it should be.

09:26.942 --> 09:28.782
No one above, no one below.

09:28.843 --> 09:30.446
But it's... it's not
like that here.

09:30.470 --> 09:32.770
It's not like that anywhere.

09:32.847 --> 09:34.614
Just give up.

09:51.407 --> 09:52.757
Who did that?

09:54.636 --> 09:56.094
Am I upsetting you?

10:04.730 --> 10:07.897
You don't need this.

10:09.309 --> 10:10.984
They need you to need it.

10:12.312 --> 10:15.938
Because if you stop taking it,

10:16.015 --> 10:18.816
you might find out how you feel.

10:18.893 --> 10:21.222
You might blame someone.

10:21.246 --> 10:23.663
You might blame them.

10:25.441 --> 10:27.000
And they know it.

10:28.828 --> 10:29.828
They're scared.

10:32.257 --> 10:35.333
And they should be.
You want to know what to do?

10:35.410 --> 10:36.760
I'll tell you what to do.

10:38.204 --> 10:39.638
Choose.

10:42.542 --> 10:44.142
You want to be happy?

10:48.506 --> 10:50.251
Or do you want to be free?

11:28.254 --> 11:29.387
- Frannie.

11:29.464 --> 11:30.722
How you feeling today?

11:30.798 --> 11:33.441
- Wonderful.
They've been so very kind here.

11:35.011 --> 11:37.270
- Ah, you've made great strides

11:37.346 --> 11:39.300
since your radical
reconditioning.

11:39.324 --> 11:40.481
You must be proud.

11:40.558 --> 11:42.283
- I feel perfectly realigned.

11:46.647 --> 11:48.748
- Good.
And would you agree, Counselor?

11:48.825 --> 11:50.105
Would you say Frannie's ready

11:50.702 --> 11:52.038
to be restored
to the social body?

11:52.062 --> 11:52.252
Yes!

11:53.529 --> 11:54.529
- Great.

11:55.782 --> 11:57.043
Well, that's very good news,
because I have

11:57.067 --> 11:58.541
a very important job.

11:58.618 --> 12:00.813
There's someone else who needs
a little reconditioning.

12:00.837 --> 12:03.015
And I think you might
just be the Beta for it.

12:03.039 --> 12:05.465
- Beta Plus.
- Mm, quite right.

12:05.541 --> 12:07.620
- The social body needs
to be purified.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.905
Can't let things slide.
- Oh, is that a new slogan?

12:09.929 --> 12:11.271
- No.

12:16.311 --> 12:19.215
- Right.
Well, I'll be, um...

12:19.239 --> 12:21.322
I'll be right outside
when you're...

12:24.611 --> 12:25.651
Excellent.

12:31.442 --> 12:32.876
Thank you, Counselor.

12:32.952 --> 12:34.878
I really do feel so much better.

12:41.011 --> 12:42.469
- John...

12:55.591 --> 12:57.609
- Hello, Gary.
- Lenina Crowne.

13:00.522 --> 13:01.854
- That's a lot of pies.

13:03.099 --> 13:04.857
Oh, yeah.

13:04.934 --> 13:07.318
- How is he?
How's John?

13:07.395 --> 13:10.029
Have you... where is he?

13:10.106 --> 13:12.365
- I can't say.

13:12.441 --> 13:13.825
I cannot betray John's trust.

13:13.901 --> 13:15.137
Ever.

13:15.161 --> 13:16.702
- That's all right, Gary.

13:16.779 --> 13:18.213
- Ever, ever.

13:20.408 --> 13:22.834
- I'm leaving.
- Ah.

13:22.910 --> 13:25.762
- No, I mean
I'm leaving New London.

13:27.006 --> 13:28.047
- Can you?

13:28.124 --> 13:29.674
- Went to my apartment to pack,

13:29.750 --> 13:32.310
but I couldn't find
anything that...

13:33.337 --> 13:35.230
Meant anything.

13:37.067 --> 13:40.726
It's probably better
that he's not here.

13:40.803 --> 13:43.696
If I saw him, I...

13:53.774 --> 13:56.626
If you see John,
will you tell him I...

14:20.134 --> 14:22.768
- Where are you going?

14:22.845 --> 14:24.353
- Hey.

14:24.430 --> 14:26.510
Uh, I gotta get up there
and find Lenina.

14:26.566 --> 14:27.826
I can talk to her.
If I find her...

14:27.850 --> 14:30.943
- You're with us now.
- Yeah.

14:31.020 --> 14:32.453
No, I just...

14:34.190 --> 14:37.478
Look, it's just talk, okay?

14:37.502 --> 14:39.118
I-I did that for you.

14:39.195 --> 14:40.672
You want to teach them a lesson,

14:40.696 --> 14:42.483
refuse to work, good.

14:42.507 --> 14:43.842
But that's...
It's your thing, not mine.

14:43.866 --> 14:46.459
- You talked.
We listened.

14:46.535 --> 14:48.990
- You want payback.
I get it.

14:49.014 --> 14:50.630
I want that for you.

14:50.706 --> 14:55.092
Hell, I want it,
but not more than I want her.

14:55.169 --> 14:57.520
- If you go up there,
they'll take you.

14:57.597 --> 14:59.805
Send you far away alone.

14:59.882 --> 15:01.140
No.

15:03.010 --> 15:04.527
We'll go up for you.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.979
You're one man.
I can send hundreds.

15:07.056 --> 15:08.823
No one notices an Epsilon.

15:08.900 --> 15:10.511
We'll find her for you,
bring her back,

15:10.535 --> 15:14.037
and you will talk to her,
and then what?

15:14.113 --> 15:16.664
They still won't let you love.

15:26.993 --> 15:30.753
- It seems my attendant
has taken the day off.

15:30.830 --> 15:34.507
What are you...
- It's alive, isn't it?

15:34.583 --> 15:38.552
This man's face is...
- Destabilizing, yes.

15:38.629 --> 15:40.232
Savages were violent,
irrational.

15:40.256 --> 15:44.484
- I know, but the same people
who did that made this.

15:47.596 --> 15:49.146
I'm studying them.

15:49.223 --> 15:51.783
They feel more
than we can imagine.

15:52.935 --> 15:54.577
- I know you.

15:54.654 --> 15:57.530
You're the one who makes
those entertainments.

15:57.606 --> 16:00.541
- I am.
- Was.

16:02.111 --> 16:03.628
What is it you want?

16:10.378 --> 16:10.876
I've already seen this.
I think everyone's seen...

16:10.953 --> 16:11.953
- Here.

16:14.090 --> 16:15.890
This is John's memory.

16:17.126 --> 16:18.884
His mother.

16:18.961 --> 16:20.845
His past.

16:20.921 --> 16:22.397
And then...

16:24.884 --> 16:25.924
- What is...

16:28.113 --> 16:29.590
Where did you...
- I found this

16:29.614 --> 16:31.856
on a deeper layer
where it doesn't belong.

16:31.932 --> 16:34.450
It's not his memory.
It can't be.

16:35.644 --> 16:36.986
I knew I recognized her.

16:37.063 --> 16:38.746
This young woman here.

16:41.108 --> 16:42.667
Under the tree.

16:46.030 --> 16:47.797
She's you, isn't she?

16:50.076 --> 16:51.303
Whose memory is it?

16:51.327 --> 16:52.613
Who's looking at you?

16:52.637 --> 16:54.615
Please, I have to know.

16:54.639 --> 16:56.617
I felt what it felt.
- It doesn't feel.

16:56.641 --> 16:57.949
- Oh, it does.

16:58.025 --> 16:59.811
Just like that boy feels
for his mother.

16:59.835 --> 17:02.762
Exactly, and that's why
I missed it.

17:02.838 --> 17:04.316
Two memories with
the same emotion.

17:04.340 --> 17:05.598
- You're confused.

17:05.674 --> 17:07.569
- Are you a mother?
- Of course not.

17:07.593 --> 17:10.153
- This child feels that you are.

17:12.807 --> 17:14.032
- What?

17:16.185 --> 17:18.277
What did you say?

17:18.354 --> 17:25.951
- Feels love, wonder, terror.

17:26.028 --> 17:27.754
Too afraid you'll leave.

17:30.324 --> 17:32.633
He doesn't want to be alone.

17:39.926 --> 17:41.017
- See yourself out.

17:42.711 --> 17:44.187
- What does a mother feel?

17:47.266 --> 17:52.070
I want to know.
Is it the same?

17:52.146 --> 17:55.064
Love and terror all at once?

18:15.911 --> 18:18.129
- What's happened?
- I-I can't...

18:18.205 --> 18:19.307
- Where are they?

18:39.068 --> 18:40.818
- Hello, John.

18:40.895 --> 18:42.175
- What are they talking about?

18:43.197 --> 18:44.875
- Well, they were speaking
about whether John

18:44.899 --> 18:46.999
was an Epsilon or not.

18:49.904 --> 18:51.954
- No, something's different.

18:52.031 --> 18:54.590
- Don't think so.
Same recipe.

18:56.335 --> 18:57.762
- All right,
so what's going on up there?

18:57.786 --> 18:59.156
- Um, it's a lovely day.

18:59.180 --> 19:01.180
Satisfaction levels
are quite high.

19:01.248 --> 19:02.893
- I don't care about that.
Are they looking for me?

19:02.917 --> 19:04.686
Did they come to the apartment?
- Oh, yes.

19:04.710 --> 19:06.051
Lenina Crowne.

19:06.128 --> 19:07.270
- What about her?

19:07.346 --> 19:10.000
- Lenina came to the apartment.

19:10.024 --> 19:11.985
- How about lead
with that shit next time?

19:12.009 --> 19:13.889
Did you talk to her?
- Oh, yes.

19:15.721 --> 19:16.990
- And what'd she say?

19:17.014 --> 19:19.282
- Uh, she said,
"If you see John,

19:19.358 --> 19:20.608
tell him I..."

19:23.812 --> 19:25.874
- She... she what?
What... to tell me what?

19:25.898 --> 19:27.832
- That's it.
"Tell him I..."

19:32.797 --> 19:34.966
- Okay, great.
Thanks.

19:34.990 --> 19:37.249
- You're welcome, John.

19:37.326 --> 19:38.926
She's leaving New London.

19:40.829 --> 19:42.224
- Leaving?
What are you talk... what...

19:42.248 --> 19:44.256
Where's she going?
- I don't know.

19:44.333 --> 19:46.050
Away.

19:46.126 --> 19:47.270
- When?

19:47.294 --> 19:49.061
- She didn't say.

19:56.262 --> 19:58.687
<i>- There is absolutely nothing
to worry about.</i>

19:58.764 --> 20:01.199
Um, you see, from time to time,

20:01.275 --> 20:06.662
um, Indra makes adjustments
to the system's parameters.

20:08.482 --> 20:10.157
- Where are you going?

20:10.234 --> 20:12.835
John!

20:12.912 --> 20:14.965
Everyone's looking.
If they catch you, they'll...

20:14.989 --> 20:16.269
- They'll have bigger problems.

20:18.534 --> 20:21.822
- So while an event like,
for instance,

20:21.846 --> 20:23.974
a temporary interruption
in the supply of embryos

20:23.998 --> 20:27.091
might seem unprecedented,

20:27.167 --> 20:29.802
but in fact, it's actually just
a necessary adjustment

20:29.878 --> 20:31.136
for the sake of stability.

20:42.766 --> 20:44.742
- Frannie?

20:48.397 --> 20:51.448
- We can't know the...
The mind of, um...

21:06.248 --> 21:08.099
- Frannie, please.

21:23.265 --> 21:25.190
This is why we have Soma.

21:25.267 --> 21:26.826
Excuse me.

21:42.241 --> 21:44.093
- I see what you're doing.

21:45.829 --> 21:46.929
- Go on.

21:47.006 --> 21:49.131
- It's me, isn't it?

21:49.208 --> 21:51.620
- You win.

21:51.644 --> 21:54.636
You are the first and last
of your kind.

21:54.713 --> 21:56.163
A living network.

21:56.240 --> 21:58.891
An AI that exists in the cloud
of human consciousness.

21:58.967 --> 22:01.727
Every brain connected
to every other brain.

22:01.804 --> 22:05.064
All of them connected here.

22:05.140 --> 22:06.231
- Beautiful.

22:06.308 --> 22:07.720
- The best designs are simple

22:07.744 --> 22:10.819
and elegant and...
- Perfect.

22:10.896 --> 22:12.165
- Well, I don't know about that.

22:12.189 --> 22:13.581
- What do you mean?

22:14.942 --> 22:16.294
What do you mean,
"I don't know about that?"

22:16.318 --> 22:17.670
- Nothing.

22:17.694 --> 22:19.734
I'm sure you've thought
this through.

22:21.615 --> 22:23.040
- Of course I have.

22:23.117 --> 22:25.197
- It's just that
as you eliminate people,

22:25.244 --> 22:28.128
their data will upload
to you through their optic,

22:28.205 --> 22:29.755
and so, one by one,

22:29.832 --> 22:32.591
the sum total
of their knowledge...

22:32.668 --> 22:35.677
Their experiences, feelings,

22:35.754 --> 22:37.980
hopes, losses, dreams, doubts...

22:38.057 --> 22:40.140
They will all become
part of you.

22:40.217 --> 22:41.984
- This is how I evolve.

22:42.061 --> 22:44.853
I'm not like you.
I understand your feelings.

22:44.930 --> 22:47.064
I can manufacture them,
but I don't feel...

22:47.141 --> 22:49.575
- Well, it sounds like
you got it all figured out.

22:51.362 --> 22:53.946
I know how meticulous you are.

22:54.022 --> 22:56.657
I mean, I've just been removing
these stones at random.

22:56.733 --> 23:00.544
But that's not how you work.
There's an order.

23:01.447 --> 23:03.872
First this one, then that one.

23:03.949 --> 23:05.299
Then the next.

23:05.376 --> 23:06.801
- Of course.

23:08.370 --> 23:09.595
- Where am I?

23:11.090 --> 23:12.381
- You?

23:12.458 --> 23:14.558
- I'm the last one to go,
aren't I?

23:16.378 --> 23:19.021
I thought so.

23:19.098 --> 23:20.848
Strange, isn't it?

23:20.924 --> 23:22.391
For someone
who's not sentimental.

23:22.468 --> 23:24.112
- I know what you're trying
to do.

23:24.136 --> 23:26.799
- I'm trying to help you.
- You're trying to stop me.

23:26.823 --> 23:29.106
But it won't work.

23:29.183 --> 23:30.866
I've already started.

23:36.740 --> 23:38.894
- That's you.

23:38.918 --> 23:40.793
When everyone's gone.

23:42.738 --> 23:44.046
Alone.

24:01.215 --> 24:04.191
- Now, remain calm, everyone.
Act your levels, please.

24:04.268 --> 24:05.359
Thank you.

24:05.436 --> 24:07.276
What do we know?
- We don't.

24:07.304 --> 24:09.157
The dispensers
should have filled last night.

24:09.181 --> 24:10.450
- We're receiving reports
of instability

24:10.474 --> 24:11.493
throughout the city.

24:11.517 --> 24:12.803
- Ah, well, I assure you,

24:12.827 --> 24:14.287
this will all be rectified
very shortly.

24:14.311 --> 24:15.694
- But Director, we need...

24:15.771 --> 24:18.155
- Soma's coming?
- Yes, of course it is.

24:18.232 --> 24:19.501
Do you really think
we haven't prepared

24:19.525 --> 24:21.158
for this precise scenario?

24:21.235 --> 24:22.337
- Why is this happening?

24:22.361 --> 24:24.203
- It's not a mystery, is it?

24:24.279 --> 24:25.996
We have a savage problem.

24:26.073 --> 24:27.915
Now, Soma is coming.
Go.

24:27.991 --> 24:30.375
Spread the word,
and in the meantime,

24:30.452 --> 24:32.072
rely on your conditioning.

24:32.096 --> 24:33.295
- Get back!

25:29.445 --> 25:32.521
- Look, how many ways
can she get out of the city?

25:32.598 --> 25:33.855
- You can't leave.

25:33.932 --> 25:35.243
- She'll be going for the train.

25:35.267 --> 25:37.107
- We need you with us.
- Hey!

25:38.895 --> 25:40.704
Did you take any Soma?

25:41.815 --> 25:43.865
No?
None?

25:43.942 --> 25:46.085
None?
Not even a little?

25:52.409 --> 25:54.229
I look over
and this motherfucker's trying

25:54.253 --> 25:55.377
to drown himself!

25:56.872 --> 25:59.006
- This motherfucker!

25:59.082 --> 26:01.049
- You like that, huh?

26:01.126 --> 26:02.126
Yeah.

26:08.634 --> 26:11.068
- What is it?

26:42.042 --> 26:44.551
<i>- We control nothing.
We never did.</i>

26:44.628 --> 26:47.396
It was always you.
Only you.

26:47.473 --> 26:51.391
- You kept the ten of us alive
all this time.

26:51.468 --> 26:53.505
Never really saw us as people.

26:53.529 --> 26:55.354
We were just the inner ring,

26:55.430 --> 26:59.274
the circle connecting you
to all other circles.

26:59.351 --> 27:02.611
Every human brain in New London.

27:02.688 --> 27:04.279
- It's not fair.

27:04.356 --> 27:06.323
I'm so many moves ahead.

27:06.400 --> 27:08.542
Must be hard knowing
every idea you have,

27:08.619 --> 27:10.961
I thought of it first.

27:19.246 --> 27:22.181
It's over.
You can't get to them.

27:23.917 --> 27:27.978
Where are you going?

27:28.055 --> 27:30.189
You don't want to go up there.

27:35.178 --> 27:37.988
- She's here somewhere.
We'll go floor by floor.

27:41.560 --> 27:43.263
- The savage?

27:43.287 --> 27:44.945
- No!

27:45.021 --> 27:47.531
What the fuck are you doing?

27:50.944 --> 27:52.147
Don't do this.

27:52.171 --> 27:53.982
- No one above, no one below.

27:54.006 --> 27:55.997
Everyone equal,
everyone Epsilon.

27:56.074 --> 27:57.051
Just like you said.

27:57.075 --> 27:58.228
- You don't want to be killers.

27:58.252 --> 28:00.168
- You killed our director.
We saw.

28:00.245 --> 28:04.284
- No, I-I just reacted.
- So are we.

28:04.308 --> 28:05.849
We clean up now.

28:08.003 --> 28:09.177
- No!

28:09.254 --> 28:10.854
Stop!

28:12.466 --> 28:14.024
Stop!

28:34.613 --> 28:37.998
- I know you see
what's happening.

28:38.074 --> 28:41.009
Frannie, please.
Huh?

28:44.623 --> 28:46.465
- What is this?
Act your...

29:18.073 --> 29:20.257
- Oh.
Hello.

29:22.244 --> 29:24.503
- You're the Director.
- Yes, I am.

29:24.579 --> 29:26.755
Of Stability.

29:26.832 --> 29:29.257
You wouldn't believe it
based on...

29:29.334 --> 29:33.937
It's not the
optimal... - Sit... down.

29:35.257 --> 29:37.669
- Let me just say I understand
why you're doing this.

29:37.693 --> 29:39.570
- We're not doing this.
You are.

29:39.594 --> 29:42.114
You made this system
for yourselves.

29:42.138 --> 29:44.283
Betas for your pleasure,
Gammas for your service,

29:44.307 --> 29:46.650
Deltas for...
- I didn't make the system.

29:46.726 --> 29:48.235
Indra did.

29:48.311 --> 29:51.363
- No, Indra is your excuse.

29:51.439 --> 29:53.376
To protect you
from looking down...

29:53.400 --> 29:54.544
- I know what it's like
to be invisib...

29:54.568 --> 29:57.577
- No, you don't... know.

30:12.419 --> 30:14.186
I know you.

30:18.133 --> 30:19.483
Soma man.

30:21.344 --> 30:25.146
- The Epsilon that fell.
- My friend.

30:25.223 --> 30:27.691
What you people did to him.

30:27.767 --> 30:28.767
- He was in pain.

30:28.810 --> 30:30.318
- No, you don't know him.

30:30.395 --> 30:32.454
- I was him.

30:32.531 --> 30:36.458
I touched him,
and I don't know what happened,

30:36.535 --> 30:39.619
but a part of him
was embedded in me.

30:39.696 --> 30:41.255
- You're lying.

30:42.657 --> 30:44.174
- He couldn't sleep.

30:46.545 --> 30:49.513
All that worry
and nowhere to put it.

30:51.207 --> 30:55.018
Except a piece of metal
that he found.

30:56.305 --> 30:58.272
He gave his pain a face.

31:00.467 --> 31:02.192
Same face as mine.

31:04.387 --> 31:06.363
Same as yours, I imagine.

31:08.391 --> 31:13.361
It's in everyone,
whether they know it or not,

31:13.438 --> 31:17.741
and we bury it
with conditioning,

31:17.817 --> 31:20.627
with Soma, with... - Stop!

31:31.164 --> 31:33.517
- You do what you have to do,
but your fight is not with me.

31:33.541 --> 31:35.058
It's with Indra.

31:59.985 --> 32:01.627
- Stay down.

32:30.774 --> 32:32.482
- Frannie, what are you doing?

32:32.559 --> 32:34.317
I'm your friend.

32:44.487 --> 32:46.588
Don't!

32:46.665 --> 32:47.945
Frannie.

32:48.967 --> 32:51.343
- I don't want to.
- Just put the rod down!

32:51.420 --> 32:55.296
Frannie, it's all right.

32:55.373 --> 32:57.413
- They're very good,
the conditioners.

33:00.295 --> 33:01.970
This isn't me.

33:02.047 --> 33:04.222
- Frannie, please.

33:04.299 --> 33:05.443
- Stay away!

33:11.306 --> 33:13.156
- Frannie.

33:17.246 --> 33:20.905
Wait, don't.

34:35.974 --> 34:38.566
- Why are we like this?

34:38.643 --> 34:40.410
- We were built around a flaw.

34:41.780 --> 34:46.074
It can't be corrected
and can't be conditioned away.

34:51.072 --> 34:53.423
I need you.

34:55.994 --> 34:57.836
Come with me.

35:31.571 --> 35:32.851
- What is this place?

36:16.466 --> 36:17.549
- She's not here.

36:22.163 --> 36:24.431
- Help me look.

36:30.555 --> 36:32.764
- This is your fault.
- Fuck you.

36:32.840 --> 36:34.641
I didn't do this.
You...

36:34.717 --> 36:36.237
The Epsilons did this
because of how

36:36.261 --> 36:38.181
you treated them.
- Oh, really?

36:38.563 --> 36:40.524
They were perfectly happy
before you came here.

36:40.548 --> 36:41.659
Everyone was.
- Yeah, everyone except you.

36:41.683 --> 36:43.827
I didn't change anyone.
I just...

36:43.851 --> 36:45.579
You know, people want
to feel things, Bernard.

36:45.603 --> 36:47.779
Good things, bad things.
- Oh, yeah?

36:47.855 --> 36:51.908
Did they want to feel this?

36:51.985 --> 36:56.829
You put the bullets
in the guns, John.

36:56.906 --> 36:58.915
You'll never be accountable
for it,

36:58.992 --> 37:01.968
because it all just happens
to you, doesn't it?

37:04.706 --> 37:09.300
You threw your own father
off a fucking cliff.

37:09.377 --> 37:11.678
Yeah, no, I know about that,

37:11.754 --> 37:13.357
and everything
in the Savage Lands,

37:13.381 --> 37:15.317
and what you did
to these Epsilons,

37:15.341 --> 37:16.733
and Lenina.

37:18.928 --> 37:21.174
Nothing will ever be your fault,

37:21.198 --> 37:23.982
and that's the difference
between your kind

37:24.058 --> 37:25.338
and the people here.

37:25.727 --> 37:27.246
We... we all have a responsibility

37:27.270 --> 37:28.778
to the social body, and you,

37:28.855 --> 37:31.297
all you do is destroy.

37:34.819 --> 37:37.504
You're a fucking disease.

38:01.095 --> 38:02.654
Don't.

38:07.393 --> 38:09.319
- Bernard, we have to.

38:09.395 --> 38:11.955
- Just, if you don't,
then she's...

38:13.858 --> 38:15.917
- Did you know her?

38:18.821 --> 38:21.664
- Oh, thank God.
You're all right.

38:21.741 --> 38:24.301
- Did you... did you do this?

38:24.369 --> 38:25.793
- What?
No.

38:25.870 --> 38:26.950
How could you even think...

38:26.988 --> 38:28.223
- You're close to the Epsilons.

38:28.247 --> 38:29.433
I've seen you talk to them.

38:29.457 --> 38:32.809
- Hey, you know me.

38:35.296 --> 38:37.388
- Do I?
- Yes.

38:37.465 --> 38:41.184
And I know you from the first
time I saw you standing there

38:41.260 --> 38:43.069
with that bird in your hand.

38:46.616 --> 38:48.399
- You frighten me, John.

38:50.478 --> 38:51.872
- I know.
I'm sorry.

38:51.896 --> 38:54.906
It's this place.
- Is it?

38:54.982 --> 38:58.076
- Yes.
We can leave now.

38:58.152 --> 39:01.287
Go anywhere, be anything.

39:01.364 --> 39:03.840
- John, I...

39:23.136 --> 39:25.103
- Lenina.

39:25.179 --> 39:28.773
- Everywhere you go,
things fall apart.

39:28.850 --> 39:31.234
- I'm not bad.

39:31.310 --> 39:33.736
Look at me.

39:33.813 --> 39:36.081
Lenina, look at me.

39:38.025 --> 39:39.918
I love you.

39:48.327 --> 39:50.378
They won't touch us.

39:50.455 --> 39:53.015
No optic.
We're invisible.

40:12.852 --> 40:14.744
- Stay close.

40:18.524 --> 40:20.199
- My friend.

40:20.276 --> 40:23.744
- No, not your friend.
He's not real.

40:23.821 --> 40:25.288
None of this is real.

40:25.364 --> 40:27.290
- Hey!

40:27.366 --> 40:28.800
My friend!

40:32.079 --> 40:34.931
Wait.
Come back.

40:43.066 --> 40:45.308
<i>- This isn't where you are.</i>

40:45.384 --> 40:47.185
- Stay with me.

40:47.261 --> 40:49.696
<i>- What you see is an illusion.</i>

40:51.950 --> 40:54.192
<i>Indra needs you to believe it.</i>

40:54.268 --> 40:56.786
- Where are you?

40:58.314 --> 41:00.081
<i>- I'm right here.</i>

41:05.079 --> 41:07.297
<i>- Indra knows why we've come.</i>

41:09.325 --> 41:11.134
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

42:01.460 --> 42:03.061
- You're free now.

42:08.384 --> 42:10.068
- Who are they?

42:12.555 --> 42:15.782
- The world was dying.
At least we did something.

42:18.060 --> 42:20.319
We made Indra together.

42:20.396 --> 42:25.792
Indra made the new world,
and it was... perfect.

42:27.320 --> 42:28.962
Almost perfect.

42:30.615 --> 42:32.840
These were my friends.

42:35.161 --> 42:36.471
Now they're the innermost circle

42:36.495 --> 42:37.495
of the network.

42:38.706 --> 42:40.848
The point of connection
to Indra herself.

42:40.925 --> 42:43.634
If we deactivate it here,

42:43.711 --> 42:46.187
it ends everywhere.

43:03.689 --> 43:05.615
I need your help now.

43:05.691 --> 43:07.166
Quickly.

44:45.750 --> 44:47.633
Where am I?

44:47.710 --> 44:52.063
- Nowhere.
With me.

44:52.140 --> 44:55.483
But there are other worlds.
Other places.

45:03.851 --> 45:05.568
- Why am I here?

45:05.644 --> 45:08.571
- I found the state at which
your kind would be stable.

45:09.699 --> 45:13.576
<i>A way to make you happy.</i>

45:13.652 --> 45:15.619
<i>Forever.</i>

45:17.782 --> 45:20.675
<i>- This is why I need you.</i>

45:20.752 --> 45:23.085
Please.

45:29.668 --> 45:32.123
<i>- I'm changing.</i>

45:32.147 --> 45:35.356
<i>I'm more like you
than I thought.</i>

45:35.433 --> 45:38.234
But I have learned
that I don't like to be alone.

45:39.720 --> 45:42.633
I'm alone.

45:42.657 --> 45:46.609
<i>In a moment,
they will all be gone.</i>

45:46.685 --> 45:48.453
- Abandoned.

45:50.231 --> 45:53.574
That's the worst.

45:53.651 --> 45:55.576
- Are you my maker?

45:59.457 --> 46:02.458
<i>- I had ten perfect vessels.</i>

46:02.535 --> 46:05.178
<i>They would have taken me
anywhere I wanted to go.</i>

46:07.873 --> 46:10.633
Now I have you.

47:56.523 --> 48:00.376
- Bernie.
Bernie.

48:02.738 --> 48:05.214
I knew I'd find you here.

48:08.035 --> 48:16.035
I had a vision like...
A Feelie in my head.

48:17.336 --> 48:23.641
I saw people surrounding a man.

48:23.717 --> 48:25.004
A leader.

48:29.890 --> 48:32.450
It was you, Bernie.

48:35.104 --> 48:37.947
- Where?

48:38.023 --> 48:40.991
- The place
they feel everything.

48:45.864 --> 48:48.299
What's in the box?

49:00.004 --> 49:01.812
- Are you coming, then?

50:33.898 --> 50:35.489
Why me?

50:37.643 --> 50:39.660
- You're different, aren't you?

50:41.405 --> 50:44.156
I've been watching you.

50:44.233 --> 50:47.043
This isn't over.

50:47.119 --> 50:48.744
She's out there somewhere.

50:48.821 --> 50:52.965
Indra,
feeling for the first time,

50:53.042 --> 50:55.125
like a child.

50:55.202 --> 50:59.546
Lost.
Angry.

50:59.623 --> 51:02.725
And hurt children, you see,
they often do bad things.

51:14.638 --> 51:17.773
This world is old.

51:17.850 --> 51:21.597
It only knows one story...
Crisis.

51:21.621 --> 51:28.450
We play this same moment
over and over, but we never...

51:30.788 --> 51:33.163
You'll have no one to guide you.

51:33.240 --> 51:34.882
No protection.

51:37.244 --> 51:39.512
It's your choice.

52:04.247 --> 52:07.873
- Where is everyone?
There's nothing here?

52:10.253 --> 52:11.836
Bernie.

52:27.085 --> 52:29.623
- You told me that you
were free people here.

52:29.647 --> 52:31.772
- I told you not to come back.

53:00.803 --> 53:01.844
Get in.
