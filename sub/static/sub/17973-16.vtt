10:08.609 --> 10:11.343
Oh, why couldn't this have
been on the Fox homepage?

10:11.345 --> 10:13.111
Then no one
would've seen it.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.013
Are you kidding?
We're gonna be famous.

10:15.015 --> 10:18.984
Oh, great. So 500,000
strangers have seen you

10:18.986 --> 10:23.254
frapping it up with some girl
who isn't your wife!

10:23.256 --> 10:26.358
Wow. I misread the room.

10:28.861 --> 10:31.830
"Frapp Attack" is up
to five million views!

10:31.832 --> 10:33.665
You're viral, man.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.500
Well, then,
so is your mother.

10:35.502 --> 10:38.336
ROBERTA:
Cleveland, there's
someone here to see you!

10:40.940 --> 10:43.141
Oh, my God! Are you
the grocery cart police?

10:43.143 --> 10:44.676
I don't want no trouble.

10:44.678 --> 10:45.944
They're in the back.

10:45.946 --> 10:47.345
Cleveland, you dumbass.

10:47.347 --> 10:49.080
That's Willy Nilly,

10:49.082 --> 10:51.850
the biggest hip-hop producer
in the world.

10:51.852 --> 10:53.585
I saw "Frapp Attack"
on the Internet

10:53.587 --> 10:55.120
and came here to sign you.

10:55.122 --> 10:56.421
You're going to be huge.

10:56.423 --> 10:58.356
All right.
I'm intrigued.

10:58.358 --> 10:59.791
Let's hear your pitch.

10:59.793 --> 11:01.259
I'm going to take you
to Hollywood

11:01.261 --> 11:02.794
to perform "Frapp Attack"
with me

11:02.796 --> 11:05.497
at the Kids' Choice Awards
and turn you into a star.

11:05.499 --> 11:07.032
Mm-hmm. Interesting.

11:07.034 --> 11:09.167
But I am fielding other offers.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.835
What do you got, Coach K?

11:10.837 --> 11:13.204
I've got a huge nose
and no lips,

11:13.206 --> 11:15.340
but I can offer you
a quality education

11:15.342 --> 11:18.777
and a chance to play basketball
at Duke University.

11:18.779 --> 11:20.779
You're a straight shooter,
Coach K.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.147
That's not lost on me.

11:22.149 --> 11:23.848
But for my music career,

11:23.850 --> 11:26.017
I should probably go
with the music guy.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.452
I'm in.

11:27.454 --> 11:29.421
What about you,
Chocolate Thunder?

11:29.423 --> 11:31.489
I'd rather hit myself
in the head with a mallet

11:31.491 --> 11:32.957
than go to Duke.

11:32.959 --> 11:35.160
Plus, my sport
is bird-watching.

11:36.662 --> 11:37.862
(chirping)

11:37.864 --> 11:38.997
There they are.

11:38.999 --> 11:41.032
(chuckling)

11:44.603 --> 11:46.104
DONNA:
Hell, no!

11:46.106 --> 11:47.806
If you can't behave
yourself at work,

11:47.808 --> 11:49.140
I'm not letting you go

11:49.142 --> 11:50.875
halfway around the globe
to Hollywood.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.610
But, Donna,
don't you see?

11:52.612 --> 11:55.613
This is exactly what my
humdrum life is missing.

11:55.615 --> 11:58.316
Cleveland, Willy Nilly
is a terrible influence.

11:58.318 --> 12:00.151
He's all about the clubs
and partying,

12:00.153 --> 12:02.153
throwing cash
at the ladies' butts,

12:02.155 --> 12:04.022
leaving lights on
when he's not in the room.

12:04.024 --> 12:05.990
Willy Nilly is
a lovely man.

12:05.992 --> 12:08.093
Plus, America
wants me.

12:08.095 --> 12:10.128
I'm a motherfrappin'
hit-maker!

12:10.130 --> 12:11.996
You had nothing to do
with that song.

12:11.998 --> 12:14.833
Rallo and Junior did it
with their computer machine.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.668
They're making fun
of you, Cleveland.

12:16.670 --> 12:17.936
You're not a singer.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.003
I'll sing at
your funeral.

12:19.005 --> 12:20.271
(growls)
(whimpers)

12:23.042 --> 12:25.243
Get your pink ass
off my car!

12:26.378 --> 12:28.680
"Please turn around."

12:28.682 --> 12:30.248
Cleveland told me
you got a problem

12:30.250 --> 12:32.150
with him coming out
to L.A. with me.

12:32.152 --> 12:34.185
I promised him
I would talk to you.

12:34.187 --> 12:36.354
You can quiet your
dapper yapper.

12:36.356 --> 12:38.857
I'm not letting Cleveland
go anywhere with you.

12:38.859 --> 12:41.659
Look, I think you got
the wrong idea about me.

12:41.661 --> 12:43.094
Just 'cause I got a song

12:43.096 --> 12:45.029
called "Party Till
Your Boobs Fall Off"

12:45.031 --> 12:47.499
doesn't mean I'm some kind
of boob-loving party guy.

12:47.501 --> 12:50.168
Mm-hmm.
I'm more of a
boob-loving homebody.

12:50.170 --> 12:51.636
(laughs)

12:51.638 --> 12:53.705
Look, just give me
five minutes of your time.

12:53.707 --> 12:55.206
I'll give you
four hours.

12:55.208 --> 12:56.641
I got nothing
going on.

12:56.643 --> 12:59.210
Moms are never as busy
as we say we are.

12:59.212 --> 13:01.179
And we'll be in L.A.
over a Sunday,

13:01.181 --> 13:03.181
so I'll make sure
Cleveland goes to church.

13:03.183 --> 13:05.183
What, one of those
Hollywood alien churches

13:05.185 --> 13:06.618
Tom Cruise goes to?

13:06.620 --> 13:08.853
I'm not having my Cleveland
come home all toothy

13:08.855 --> 13:11.122
and laughing too hard
for no reason.

13:11.124 --> 13:14.192
Cleveland is a real person,
and I want to keep him that way.

13:14.194 --> 13:16.795
Well, show me what
real people do, then.

13:16.797 --> 13:18.296
Please, I want to know.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.698
Well, for starters,
we drive our own cars

13:20.700 --> 13:22.433
and pump our own gas.

13:25.604 --> 13:27.205
(chuckling):
Oh, so it goes in there.

13:27.207 --> 13:29.374
So we going to make
a baby car?

13:29.376 --> 13:31.676
Oh, Nilly, you silly.

13:33.012 --> 13:34.245
Hi, Donna.

13:34.247 --> 13:35.313
Hi, Donna.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.148
Donna, hi.

13:37.150 --> 13:40.018
Weird. Your paparazzi
don't have cameras.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.686
They're not paparazzi.

13:41.688 --> 13:43.488
Oh, they're
your managers.
No.

13:43.490 --> 13:44.989
They want you to
produce their demo?

13:44.991 --> 13:46.157
No.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.592
Drug dealers.
Two of them.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.694
But that's not why
they were being friendly.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.763
That's just how people are
in a small town.

13:51.765 --> 13:53.431
That's kind of nice.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.033
You know, I'm
starting to think

13:55.035 --> 13:57.435
maybe I don't need
my big, fancy limo

13:57.437 --> 14:00.038
or my bodyguard or
my monkey butler.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.707
You are free to go, Cadbury.

14:02.709 --> 14:04.108
Hello there,
friendly fella.

14:04.110 --> 14:05.176
(monkey shrieking,
man screaming)

14:05.178 --> 14:07.145
I'm onto you, Willy.

14:07.147 --> 14:08.913
I don't think
that flashy lifestyle

14:08.915 --> 14:10.081
is who you really are.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.349
Maybe you won't be

14:11.351 --> 14:13.117
such a bad influence
on Cleveland.

14:13.119 --> 14:14.319
I told you.

14:14.321 --> 14:16.254
Hey, do you think
we could go catch

14:16.256 --> 14:17.956
some fireflies
in a jar?

14:17.958 --> 14:20.191
Now, it's important
you learn the distinction

14:20.193 --> 14:24.429
between small-town life
and country-ass (bleep).

14:24.431 --> 14:26.130
You did it!

14:26.132 --> 14:27.765
Donna says I can go.

14:27.767 --> 14:30.001
Go? Oh, right, L.A.

14:30.003 --> 14:32.337
Yeah, I'm not
doing that anymore.

14:32.339 --> 14:34.505
I'm going to stay in Stoolbend.

14:34.507 --> 14:35.940
What? Why?

14:35.942 --> 14:38.176
The thing is,
I want your life.

14:38.178 --> 14:40.178
And I want your wife.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.346
Oh, we're rapping?

14:41.348 --> 14:43.581
Go again, but leave
my wife out of it.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.516
Boundaries.
Let me be clear.

14:45.518 --> 14:48.253
I'm in love with your wife,
and I'm taking her.

14:48.255 --> 14:49.988
Oh?

14:49.990 --> 14:52.557
To the airport!
No!

14:54.994 --> 14:56.995
No!

14:56.997 --> 14:58.096
Hey, buddy, would you mind

14:58.098 --> 15:00.398
taking a picture
of me back here?

15:02.301 --> 15:03.768
Nice.

15:03.770 --> 15:05.136
New profile photo.

15:05.138 --> 15:06.838
No!

15:13.045 --> 15:15.413
Four of hearts.
Four of hearts.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.581
Let's see.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.416
Do I have a black five?

15:18.418 --> 15:21.319
Can a red four
go on a red five?

15:21.321 --> 15:23.154
Eh, no one's watching.

15:23.156 --> 15:24.088
(gasps)

15:24.090 --> 15:25.990
Cleveland, where
have you been?

15:25.992 --> 15:27.992
Willy's driver
insisted on taking me

15:27.994 --> 15:29.527
all the way
to the airport.

15:29.529 --> 15:30.962
Where is he?

15:30.964 --> 15:32.130
He left
after lunch.

15:32.132 --> 15:33.865
I taught him how to
make sloppy joes.

15:33.867 --> 15:35.867
Donna, that man
is in love with you!

15:35.869 --> 15:37.635
We're just friends,
Cleveland.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.203
Like you and Tori.

15:39.205 --> 15:40.805
There's nothing
to worry about.

15:40.807 --> 15:42.473
Now, there's leftovers
in the fridge

15:42.475 --> 15:45.109
if you want Willy's
sloppy seconds.

15:45.111 --> 15:46.711
Ow!
Did you get it?

15:46.713 --> 15:49.147
I had it turned the wrong way.
(giggles)

15:49.149 --> 15:50.148
All right, we going again.

15:50.150 --> 15:51.449
(groans)

15:51.451 --> 15:53.751
♪ Gonna party
till your boobs fall off ♪

15:53.753 --> 15:56.154
♪ Party, party till
your boobs fall off... ♪

15:56.156 --> 15:59.157
Oh, that guy's a jerk,
but he sure can write a hook.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.892
(tires squeal)
Great Scott!

16:03.028 --> 16:03.995
Hey, Cleveland.

16:03.997 --> 16:05.596
Willy Nilly
bought my house.

16:05.598 --> 16:06.864
Renting my room back.

16:06.866 --> 16:08.433
Cheaper than what my mom
was charging me.

16:08.435 --> 16:10.768
I guess that explains
the paint job.

16:10.770 --> 16:12.203
That ain't paint.

16:12.205 --> 16:13.338
That's real
tiger fur.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.473
Now I'm thinking
about Tiger Woods.

16:15.475 --> 16:16.541
Sad.

16:16.543 --> 16:17.675
Ah, screw him.

16:17.677 --> 16:19.110
What do you think, Donna?

16:19.112 --> 16:20.178
Cutting my own grass.

16:20.180 --> 16:21.446
You're
getting there.

16:21.448 --> 16:23.147
I made you
some lemonade, Willy.

16:23.149 --> 16:25.016
You look hot.

16:26.819 --> 16:27.952
Thanks, Dee.

16:27.954 --> 16:29.253
Let me just take
a quick shower

16:29.255 --> 16:30.521
and we can go
antiquing.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.790
You know, most people
don't appreciate things

16:32.792 --> 16:33.992
that are a little older,

16:33.994 --> 16:38.096
but I think they get
more beautiful with age.

16:39.798 --> 16:42.333
I do not want you hanging
out with him, Donna.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.968
We're friends.

16:43.970 --> 16:46.771
Well, if you've got plans
with your plutonic friend,

16:46.773 --> 16:48.806
then I can go hang
out with mine.

16:48.808 --> 16:50.808
Maybe Tori and I
will go antiquing.

16:50.810 --> 16:52.310
What is antiquing?

16:52.312 --> 16:54.278
(pulsating dance music plays)

16:54.280 --> 16:56.948
Could you tell the
DJ that I asked

16:56.950 --> 16:59.984
to hear "Jack and Diane"
three hours ago,

16:59.986 --> 17:03.988
which was three hours
past my bedtime?

17:03.990 --> 17:05.990
Excuse me.

17:05.992 --> 17:08.726
Pardon me.

17:09.695 --> 17:11.162
(laughter)

17:11.164 --> 17:13.698
My Goldschlagers!

17:17.136 --> 17:19.504
Why don't we just
sit down and order?

17:19.506 --> 17:22.006
It costs
$2,000 to sit.

17:22.008 --> 17:24.042
Right. I'll get
another round

17:24.044 --> 17:26.010
and be back
in an hour and a half.

17:26.012 --> 17:28.980
Great. After this, we're
meeting my boyfriend

17:28.982 --> 17:30.815
and his funny
Serbian friends

17:30.817 --> 17:33.117
at a darker, more
crowded place.

17:33.119 --> 17:36.721
Cool.
That sounds terrible.

17:43.028 --> 17:45.797
Okay, if I fall asleep
right now,

17:45.799 --> 17:48.199
I can get 40 minutes of sleep.

17:48.201 --> 17:49.801
(sighs)

17:49.803 --> 17:51.102
My life.

17:51.104 --> 17:54.038
My life sucks.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.473
That's it.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.608
My life sucks.

17:59.011 --> 18:00.645
Hey, Willy Nilly!

18:00.647 --> 18:03.114
You want my wife?
You want my life?

18:03.116 --> 18:04.949
Well, you can have them!

18:04.951 --> 18:07.585
LESTER:
I'll take your
kindling wood!

18:07.587 --> 18:09.687
Cleveland,
what has gotten into you?

18:09.689 --> 18:12.023
12 Red Bull vodkas.

18:13.025 --> 18:14.325
What the hell, man?

18:14.327 --> 18:15.960
You say you
want my life?

18:15.962 --> 18:19.530
Well, you can't just pick
and choose the parts you like.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.132
It feels like
broken glass.

18:21.134 --> 18:22.467
What is this?

18:22.469 --> 18:24.602
100% polyester.

18:24.604 --> 18:27.138
And it gets stinky
if you sweat.

18:27.140 --> 18:30.775
And these babies
are a couple squirters.

18:33.178 --> 18:36.147
This is how I
start every day.

18:36.149 --> 18:38.850
♪

18:38.852 --> 18:40.485
Hammer time!

18:40.487 --> 18:43.287
(grunting)

18:43.289 --> 18:44.422
Whoa!

18:44.424 --> 18:46.023
Why are they even awake?

18:46.025 --> 18:47.758
They're always awake!

18:47.760 --> 18:49.594
Now, let's grab a
cup of cold coffee,

18:49.596 --> 18:51.996
spill half of it on our
pants and head to work.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.434
(groans)

18:56.436 --> 18:58.436
Smells like something
died down here.

18:58.438 --> 19:00.204
It's your dreams.

19:00.206 --> 19:03.141
And a dead dog.
And a dead cat.

19:03.143 --> 19:04.509
And a live skunk.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.310
Run along, Stinky.

19:06.312 --> 19:08.779
Don't nobody want
no smelly trouble.

19:08.781 --> 19:10.748
(growls)
(hisses)

19:12.818 --> 19:13.985
Wait. I've already
been here before.

19:13.987 --> 19:16.487
You have to come to the
mini-mart all the time.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.923
The wife called when you
were a block away from home.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.158
You're out of eggs.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.292
You're always
out of eggs,

19:21.294 --> 19:24.195
because Donna eats
18 eggs a day.

19:24.197 --> 19:25.997
And God help you
if you don't go

19:25.999 --> 19:28.633
to one of her amateur
strong-woman competitions.

19:28.635 --> 19:30.134
That sounds horrible!

19:30.136 --> 19:31.269
There's more!

19:33.038 --> 19:34.539
Now, after you've
worked a hard day,

19:34.541 --> 19:35.706
it's time for dinner--

19:35.708 --> 19:37.542
one of four dishes
your wife makes.

19:37.544 --> 19:39.177
I hope you
like tilapia,

19:39.179 --> 19:40.978
'cause that's
two of them.
Stop!

19:40.980 --> 19:42.847
I can't take any more.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.081
I don't want your life.

19:44.083 --> 19:46.417
Your life is monotonous
and depressing.

19:46.419 --> 19:48.352
That's all I
wanted to hear.

19:48.354 --> 19:52.190
I guess I was just romancing
what small-town life was.

19:52.192 --> 19:53.658
But you got a hot wife.

19:53.660 --> 19:55.426
I might just
take her with me.

19:55.428 --> 19:57.895
Sure. Let's go
tell her together.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.899
(electric razor buzzing)

20:03.769 --> 20:04.869
Hey, Donna.

20:04.871 --> 20:06.204
Hey, baby.

20:06.206 --> 20:08.839
Just doing a little trimming
over here!

20:08.841 --> 20:10.608
A'ight. I'm out.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.009
(whistles)

20:17.983 --> 20:19.250
(wind whistling)

20:22.087 --> 20:23.788
Oh, is Willy
leaving town?

20:23.790 --> 20:25.156
No, he's staying.

20:25.158 --> 20:26.490
Really?
No!

20:26.492 --> 20:27.758
He left.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.327
Fool couldn't
take the Stool.

20:29.329 --> 20:30.995
(giggles) Rapping.

20:30.997 --> 20:32.263
You were right, Donna.

20:32.265 --> 20:34.465
Men and women ought
not be friends.

20:34.467 --> 20:37.501
Aw, baby, I'm sorry you
didn't get to go to California

20:37.503 --> 20:39.670
and you're stuck here
with your humdrum life.

20:39.672 --> 20:41.005
You know what?

20:41.007 --> 20:43.274
I love my
humdrum life.

20:43.276 --> 20:45.977
It's not fancy, it's not glitzy,

20:45.979 --> 20:48.346
it's not glossary,
but nor are I.

20:48.348 --> 20:51.115
I love you, Loretta...
Tori... Donna.

20:51.117 --> 20:52.917
Oh, Cleveland.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.085
Let's eat.

20:54.087 --> 20:55.086
Junior, defrost
the Arby's!

20:55.088 --> 20:56.487
CLEVELAND JR.:
What's the occasion?

20:56.489 --> 20:57.989
Life.

21:02.428 --> 21:03.761
Not even filming it.
