00:00.167 --> 00:02.209
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

00:02.471 --> 00:04.304
- Fuck!
- I'm so sorry.

00:04.339 --> 00:06.173
It's Reynard.
He's back.

00:06.208 --> 00:07.574
Wait, I am pregnant.

00:07.609 --> 00:10.377
I wasn't the only one
he raped that night,

00:10.655 --> 00:13.423
but I was the only one
who got pregnant.

00:13.458 --> 00:15.792
This is exorcism,
you understand?

00:15.827 --> 00:17.894
Did it work?
Is it gone?

00:17.929 --> 00:21.564
In the center of your being,
there's a tiny beating heart.

00:21.599 --> 00:24.701
It's called a shade.
It's what makes you feel.

00:24.736 --> 00:27.270
The pain will burn you
till there's nothing.

00:27.305 --> 00:30.673
There was a complication.
Her shade, it's gone.

00:30.709 --> 00:32.375
I feel light,

00:32.409 --> 00:34.844
like a million pound weight's
off my chest.

00:34.879 --> 00:36.679
Say we get the perfect spell,

00:36.715 --> 00:38.681
think about the energy
it'd take to work it.

00:38.717 --> 00:40.917
Dana's baby--his son.

00:40.952 --> 00:42.719
You know, there is
a ton of lore on demigods.

00:42.754 --> 00:44.387
They're powerful
in their own right.

00:44.422 --> 00:45.722
We need to find him.

00:45.757 --> 00:47.390
As for Loria--

00:47.425 --> 00:49.292
Some 8,000 troops
are headed to the border.

00:49.327 --> 00:50.626
So we're totally outnumbered.

00:50.662 --> 00:52.829
And of course,
our preparation is affected

00:52.864 --> 00:55.898
by the continued unsteadiness
of the Wellspring.

00:55.934 --> 00:57.867
- Looks like...
- A major drought's hit.

00:57.902 --> 01:00.303
[whoosh]

01:00.338 --> 01:02.905
You can't even get out
of this shoddy little magician.

01:02.941 --> 01:05.541
Free yourself, then find me.

01:05.577 --> 01:07.817
- Alice, we can talk about this.
- Just shut up! Shut up!

01:07.846 --> 01:10.480
This is your body trying
to hold a niffin inside it.

01:10.515 --> 01:13.649
You can't--
not for much longer,

01:13.685 --> 01:15.451
or it's gonna kill us both.

01:17.589 --> 01:21.858
[panting]

01:21.893 --> 01:24.861
[groans] Seriously, you guys,
I'm in a cage.

01:24.896 --> 01:28.564
You think this is, uh,
a tad redundant?

01:28.600 --> 01:30.533
- Protocol.
- For werewolves.

01:30.568 --> 01:32.335
Okay, technically, I have

01:32.370 --> 01:35.338
sexually transmitted
lycanthropy--a very mild case.

01:35.373 --> 01:37.540
Would've been cool
to actually fully wolf out.

01:37.575 --> 01:38.841
You know...
[howls]

01:38.877 --> 01:40.343
Either way,
it's totally curable.

01:40.378 --> 01:43.713
Treatable.
There is no actual cure.

01:43.748 --> 01:47.049
Well, silver bullet.

01:47.085 --> 01:48.751
Hey, don't go through my bag.

01:48.787 --> 01:51.921
Quentin, you're dying.

01:51.956 --> 01:53.723
Yeah, well, aren't we all?

01:53.758 --> 01:55.424
You are dying quickly.

01:55.460 --> 01:58.494
You cannot keep this thing
inside you much longer.

01:58.530 --> 01:59.862
Well, I can't let her go.

01:59.898 --> 02:01.864
Which is why you must box her.

02:01.900 --> 02:03.599
I'm not doing that to Alice.

02:03.635 --> 02:05.368
Quentin, there is no more Alice.

02:05.403 --> 02:08.538
This is uncharted territory.
Nobody knows.

02:08.573 --> 02:09.939
Well, I know that
you will be dead in days

02:09.973 --> 02:11.841
if you don't
rid yourself of her.

02:11.876 --> 02:14.644
May I help you steal from me?

02:14.679 --> 02:16.846
Nope, I got it.

02:18.049 --> 02:21.551
Good luck with all your shit.

02:21.586 --> 02:22.785
[whoosh]

02:25.857 --> 02:28.624
[groans] These damn brownouts.

02:28.660 --> 02:29.959
[sighs]

02:29.994 --> 02:33.796
We may be
the least trusted monarchs

02:33.832 --> 02:37.033
in the history of Fillory.

02:37.068 --> 02:39.669
Thank God
they don't have polls here.

02:39.704 --> 02:42.738
[droning tone]

02:45.610 --> 02:47.643
That's the third brownout
this week.

02:47.679 --> 02:50.680
If we don't fix the Wellspring
soon, Your Majesty--

02:50.715 --> 02:52.982
One problem at a time, okay?

02:53.017 --> 02:55.585
Our soldiers are
deserting us in protest,

02:55.620 --> 02:58.054
thanks to Julia
committing tree genocide.

02:58.089 --> 02:59.822
Pardon me, Your Majesty.

02:59.858 --> 03:01.591
For the official records,
may I suggest

03:01.626 --> 03:04.026
a slightly less incendiary term?

03:04.062 --> 03:05.928
Perhaps "arbicide"?

03:05.964 --> 03:07.730
Sure, if you can also recommend

03:07.765 --> 03:09.966
how we fight a war
without an army.

03:10.001 --> 03:14.470
[strained murmuring]

03:14.505 --> 03:17.874
Your Majesty,
there is one option--

03:17.909 --> 03:21.177
- a rather obscure law, based--
- Less words.

03:21.212 --> 03:23.880
One-on-one combat.

03:23.915 --> 03:26.115
Between monarchs.

03:26.150 --> 03:27.850
- A duel?
- El--

03:27.886 --> 03:29.986
With Ess's dad?
He's gotta be at least 50.

03:30.021 --> 03:31.888
And I'm pretty buff
from all the living

03:31.923 --> 03:33.990
without technology
or decent wine.

03:34.025 --> 03:35.491
Slow down.

03:35.526 --> 03:37.560
Is there any rule
about not using magic?

03:37.595 --> 03:40.763
- No, Your Majesty.
- Highness, if I may,

03:40.798 --> 03:42.932
there is a reason
we haven't brought up this, uh,

03:42.967 --> 03:44.533
option before,

03:44.569 --> 03:47.803
especially since magic
is not completely dependable.

03:47.839 --> 03:50.573
Simply put, you're likely to...

03:50.608 --> 03:52.541
well...die.

03:52.577 --> 03:55.778
Mm-hmm.
Tick, if I did this,

03:55.813 --> 03:57.847
how popular would I be?

03:57.882 --> 04:01.450
No king has ever volunteered

04:01.486 --> 04:03.019
for one-on-one combat.

04:03.054 --> 04:05.821
If you were to prevail,
you would easily be

04:05.857 --> 04:08.991
the greatest leader
in Fillorian history.

04:09.027 --> 04:10.192
- The greatest.
- The greatest.

04:10.228 --> 04:11.694
God,

04:11.729 --> 04:14.597
he's already seeing the statues.

04:14.632 --> 04:16.565

04:16.601 --> 04:20.168

So this is a breakout.

- Why are you in here anyway?
- I killed trees.

05:02.914 --> 05:05.715
- Seriously.
- That could talk.

05:05.750 --> 05:08.584
They have talking trees here?

05:08.619 --> 05:09.785
Not anymore.

Beautiful, high-level magic.

It's bad for the world.

06:08.646 --> 06:11.280
I'm not boxing you.

06:11.315 --> 06:15.951
I don't want to know

not good.

06:38.209 --> 06:40.676
I mean, you ever even touched
a sword before today?

06:40.711 --> 06:43.946
No, but...Magician.

a spell in time.
