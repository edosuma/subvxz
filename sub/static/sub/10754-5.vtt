WEBVTT

00:10.928 --> 00:13.347
Thank you for your call, Lorraine.

00:13.514 --> 00:17.809
And before the commercial break,
Roz has an important message. Roz?

00:21.605 --> 00:23.941
What? Can't come to the mic?

00:25.817 --> 00:28.570
Well, what she wanted to say was...

00:30.364 --> 00:33.367
Tomorrow, on Amber Edwards'
"Bookchat",

00:33.534 --> 00:37.788
sociologist Lamont Myman
discusses his book,

00:37.955 --> 00:42.543
"Violence in the Workplace -
Why Co-Workers Kill".

00:44.169 --> 00:47.714
Something which becomes
more and more relevant.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.925
We'll be right back.

00:51.009 --> 00:53.804
Open up, you piece of tin!

00:54.638 --> 00:57.057
- Roz!
- What are you doing here?

00:57.224 --> 01:02.437
And you? Shouldn't you wait
till after the show before exiting?

01:03.230 --> 01:07.234
- I have a little urge. Damn it!
- What is the matter?

01:07.609 --> 01:10.571
I have got to have chocolate!

01:13.782 --> 01:15.993
It's kind of a celebration.

01:16.159 --> 01:19.955
At 11:07 am, I finished
one of those magazine diets.

01:20.122 --> 01:23.208
"Seven days
to a healthier, calmer you."

01:24.585 --> 01:28.547
Come on, Roz!
I'm doing this for your own good.

01:28.714 --> 01:31.133
Wait!
Something came out!

01:33.010 --> 01:35.846
Damn! Chocolate-covered raisins.

01:36.013 --> 01:39.683
I'd like to meet the idiot
who came up with these.

01:39.850 --> 01:43.604
Take a grape, let it shrivel
into a disgusting little wart

01:43.770 --> 01:47.024
and cover it
with perfectly good chocolate.

01:47.191 --> 01:50.861
What the hell!
I'll suck the chocolate off.

01:52.696 --> 01:56.033
Be sure to save what's left
to make some wine!

01:58.000 --> 02:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:05.042 --> 02:08.544
I see those years of finishing school
paid off.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.842
<i>Mon frère</i>, we're in luck.

02:14.009 --> 02:16.428
(High-pitched electronic beep)

02:22.267 --> 02:26.647
Meadow Wood Properties still has
one share left in the mini-mall.

02:26.813 --> 02:32.069
- We should buy it. Give me five, Bro.
- I told you I'm not interested.

02:32.236 --> 02:36.782
It's a 12% return.
We've a chance to make a real killing.

02:36.949 --> 02:42.120
You and Maris are wallowing in money
like a couple of yuppie hogs.

02:42.871 --> 02:46.708
This has nothing to do with Maris.
This is my money.

02:46.875 --> 02:49.586
- And mine.
- And yours.

02:49.753 --> 02:55.259
Show some understanding. Maris
uses her money to emasculate him.

02:55.425 --> 02:59.930
This is his attempt to stop feeling
like a financial eunuch

03:00.097 --> 03:04.935
and regain some shred of his
former manhood - such as it was.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.355
Well?

03:11.400 --> 03:12.943
- 12%?
- Net.

03:13.110 --> 03:17.865
lf you're unhappy, at the end
of the year I'll buy you out.

03:18.949 --> 03:21.952
- OK, I'm in.
- Thank you, Frasier.

03:23.412 --> 03:27.249
Thank you, Roz.
That "financial eunuch" bit was great.

03:27.499 --> 03:30.377
Well, look what I had to work with.

03:37.342 --> 03:43.098
Hey, check this out! 25 cents off on
a pack of Butterbuds imitation butter.

03:44.683 --> 03:47.060
My! I can taste that scampi now!

03:49.980 --> 03:52.024
Well?

03:52.191 --> 03:54.234
(Martin wolf whistles)

03:56.153 --> 03:58.197
Daphne, very nice!

03:59.239 --> 04:01.658
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

04:02.576 --> 04:06.830
I'd be more flattered if I didn't know
how hard up you both are.

04:11.793 --> 04:15.631
I'm going out with Derek,
but I can't choose a fragrance.

04:15.881 --> 04:18.800
I've got it pinned down to these two.

04:18.966 --> 04:22.846
Heather: "fresh and bouncy
as a spring morning".

04:23.096 --> 04:27.935
Or Forbidden: "your passport
to erotic realms of pleasure".

04:28.894 --> 04:32.523
- How many times have you been out?
- It's our third date.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.691
Forbidden.

04:36.443 --> 04:38.529
So what if it's our third date?

04:38.695 --> 04:42.366
Well, sexual mores
being what they are in America,

04:42.533 --> 04:46.203
the third date is usually
when two healthy adults

04:46.370 --> 04:49.122
decide whether or not to...

04:51.834 --> 04:57.214
- ...take it to the next level.
- What kind of randy custom is that?

04:57.381 --> 04:58.799
(Doorbell)

04:58.966 --> 05:01.635
First date, second date,
let's pitch our knickers!

05:02.678 --> 05:05.180
It may be the third date for you,

05:05.347 --> 05:10.227
but it takes more than three dinners
to get bangers and mash with me.

05:15.524 --> 05:18.151
- Hello, Dr Crane.
- Hello, Daphne.

05:18.318 --> 05:22.531
- You look even lovelier than usual.
- Thank you.

05:25.951 --> 05:28.120
Is that... Forbidden?

05:28.871 --> 05:30.998
In every sense of the word.

05:33.625 --> 05:36.378
I'll scrub my neck
with unscented soap.

05:36.670 --> 05:40.424
You Americans have
an unhealthy obsession with sex.

05:40.591 --> 05:45.554
I'm sorry we can't all be as chaste
and restrained as the Royal family!

05:47.347 --> 05:50.767
- Good one, Dad!
- I've been saving it!

05:54.188 --> 05:57.816
Frasier, good news.
I spoke to my broker.

05:57.983 --> 06:02.362
Meadow Wood Properties have leased
85% of the mini-mall.

06:02.529 --> 06:06.283
Instead of 12%,
they're projecting a 15% return.

06:06.450 --> 06:10.537
Fantastic! Let's go celebrate
at an exclusive boîte.

06:10.787 --> 06:13.457
Yes, but the question is,
what boîte?

06:15.167 --> 06:16.668
- Charise?
- Too noisy.

06:16.835 --> 06:18.170
- Alsace?
- Too bright.

06:18.337 --> 06:20.172
- Papillon?
- Too crowded.

06:20.339 --> 06:22.549
We've run out of boîtes.

06:23.926 --> 06:27.012
A city this size
and only three boîtes.

06:27.179 --> 06:29.973
How do we live?

06:30.974 --> 06:35.145
- I'm going to Duke's. How about you?
- Looking for a place to eat.

06:35.312 --> 06:37.564
Come and have a beer with me.

06:40.442 --> 06:42.361
- At Duke's?
- Yeah.

06:43.237 --> 06:45.614
- Us?
- Yeah.

06:45.781 --> 06:49.117
- With you?
- Am I speaking Swahili? Yeah!

06:49.284 --> 06:54.039
You two, at Duke's, with me,
a beer, if you want! Gee!

07:03.131 --> 07:05.300
Good God, do you believe that?

07:05.467 --> 07:09.638
No. No one in the family
has ever been invited to Duke's.

07:09.805 --> 07:14.685
Not even Mother. Though at times
she could be quite the old rummy.

07:18.188 --> 07:21.984
Why, after 30 years,
is he suddenly inviting us there?

07:22.150 --> 07:24.444
- Cheerio!
- Daphne!

07:24.611 --> 07:27.990
Has Dad said anything to you
about us and Duke's?

07:28.156 --> 07:32.411
- Has he been planning this?
- You mean, behind your backs?

07:33.036 --> 07:37.541
- Precisely.
- No! What a couple of wallies!

07:37.708 --> 07:42.921
I have never met a family that's
so uncomfortable with each other.

07:44.339 --> 07:47.509
Could it be he just wants
a pint with his sons?

07:47.759 --> 07:50.554
No. Duke's is where Dad goes

07:50.721 --> 07:54.474
to escape the stresses
and strains of everyday life.

07:54.641 --> 07:57.311
In other words, us.

07:58.896 --> 08:02.858
Well, you could sit here
analysing why he invited you

08:03.025 --> 08:06.778
and fritter the night away,
or - here's a thought -

08:06.945 --> 08:10.699
you could just go
and find out for yourselves.

08:11.241 --> 08:15.287
For a lay person, she has a way
of cutting through the crap.

08:34.806 --> 08:37.643
Oh, my God! It's a roomful of Dads!

08:39.436 --> 08:43.482
- There he is!
- Oh, look at him holding court.

08:43.649 --> 08:48.320
No wonder he likes it here.
They're hanging on his every word.

08:50.197 --> 08:53.951
I've never seen him have such fun
without a remote control.

08:54.117 --> 08:57.079
Frasier, Niles!
I'm glad you could make it.

08:57.246 --> 09:00.165
Meet some guys
I was on the force with.

09:00.332 --> 09:03.919
Meet my boys. This is Frasier.
He's on the radio.

09:04.086 --> 09:07.881
This is Marty's kid,
the guy on the radio!

09:10.175 --> 09:14.721
Hey, Frasier, Joe Herman,
nice to meet you. Check this out:

09:14.888 --> 09:17.432
"I'm listening."

09:19.059 --> 09:21.854
It's like a recording of myself.

09:22.020 --> 09:25.315
- Dad.
- What?

09:25.482 --> 09:27.985
Oh, this is my other son, Niles.

09:28.151 --> 09:30.404
He's a psychiatrist, too.

09:34.074 --> 09:37.035
- He married money!
- All right!

09:39.955 --> 09:42.708
Duke, I want you to meet my boys.

09:42.875 --> 09:46.378
This is Frasier
and this is Niles.

09:46.545 --> 09:51.258
How are you? How about a couple
of Duke's specials for you?

09:51.425 --> 09:53.927
- What would those be?
- Boilermakers.

09:54.094 --> 09:56.263
Shot of whisky. Beer back.

09:56.513 --> 10:01.602
We've been drinking those all night.
Time to switch to sherry.

10:04.062 --> 10:06.231
Two boilermakers, please.

10:06.481 --> 10:10.527
Marty's been telling us about you
since you were kids.

10:10.777 --> 10:13.155
- Dad!
- I'll tell you, Frasier,

10:13.405 --> 10:17.701
we felt terrible when we heard
your wife was screwing around.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.871
- What was her name again?
- Lilith!

10:25.375 --> 10:27.920
Hey, it was a slow night, all right?

10:28.086 --> 10:32.424
All right, everybody, settle down.
I want to make a toast.

10:35.552 --> 10:38.805
For 30 years, Duke's has been
my home away from home.

10:38.972 --> 10:42.059
I look around
and I see a lot of friends.

10:42.226 --> 10:46.438
I'm going to miss you.
I'm going to miss this joint, too.

10:46.605 --> 10:49.858
May there be a place in hell
for those SOBs

10:50.025 --> 10:53.862
who are tearing it down
to build a mini-mall!

10:55.739 --> 11:00.911
Those snivelling, rat-faced bastards
from Meadow Wood Properties!

11:01.078 --> 11:02.538
To Duke's!

11:02.788 --> 11:04.665
Two more!

11:08.210 --> 11:12.714
- Did you talk to your lawyer.
- Yes. He's examined the contract.

11:12.881 --> 11:16.969
The general partner won't consider
moving the site.

11:17.135 --> 11:19.388
The deal's going through.

11:19.555 --> 11:23.100
We could have Duke's
declared a historical landmark.

11:23.267 --> 11:28.272
No. They tore down Seattle's first
Pony Express office to build it.

11:28.438 --> 11:30.482
- Damn!
- Here you go, guys.

11:30.649 --> 11:35.404
One cappuccino, one latte
and these are on me.

11:36.446 --> 11:41.618
- This guilt is driving me crazy.
- It should. You earn more than me.

11:44.413 --> 11:49.001
- Duke's was his life.
- There's nothing we can do about it.

11:49.168 --> 11:52.671
Look at it this way:
we're doing Dad a service,

11:52.838 --> 11:56.675
stopping him from drinking.
And the other policemen as well.

11:56.842 --> 11:59.511
Maybe it's a community service.

11:59.678 --> 12:03.599
Men with guns will have
one less place to liquor up.

12:03.765 --> 12:06.602
There's always Roz's place.

12:10.147 --> 12:13.192
What do you say about me
when I'm not around?

12:13.358 --> 12:16.862
I won't feel better till I tell Dad.

12:17.821 --> 12:19.364
Oh, no.

12:19.531 --> 12:24.453
It's like a woman who has one crazy
night and cheats on her boyfriend.

12:24.620 --> 12:28.707
Her only reason to confess
is to make herself feel better.

12:28.874 --> 12:32.836
So the best thing she can do
is to keep her mouth shut.

12:33.837 --> 12:36.423
Unless her boyfriend walks in,

12:36.590 --> 12:41.595
because he's flown home instead
of driving like he said he would,

12:41.762 --> 12:46.099
in which case, he's the liar,
so why should she feel bad?

12:46.308 --> 12:49.853
Thank you, Roz, for that
purely theoretical example.

12:52.189 --> 12:58.111
I agree. lf we tell him now, it'll
hurt him. We've got to keep it quiet.

12:58.278 --> 13:02.533
- I don't think it can be done.
- Of course it can!

13:02.699 --> 13:04.993
You can look Dad in the eye,

13:05.160 --> 13:08.455
knowing you have destroyed
his sanctuary?

13:08.622 --> 13:10.666
You can live with that?

13:10.916 --> 13:15.254
You forget. I married Lilith.
I can live with anything.

13:37.109 --> 13:39.152
(Electronic buzz)

13:50.539 --> 13:55.085
You buy into an investment group,
Eddie. You don't know.

13:59.798 --> 14:04.303
- Dad, what are you doing up?
- I reached out and Eddie wasn't there.

14:04.469 --> 14:07.139
You need a woman, Dad.

14:08.015 --> 14:10.392
Tell me about it.

14:10.559 --> 14:13.020
Oh, you turned the sign on.

14:13.187 --> 14:16.106
That was nice of Duke
to give it to me.

14:16.273 --> 14:20.485
You hold a glass of beer
in front of it, it turns green.

14:36.460 --> 14:38.212
Dad...

14:39.630 --> 14:44.760
Niles and I invested in the company
that's tearing down Duke's.

14:45.802 --> 14:49.306
We tried to get out of it,
but we couldn't.

14:50.807 --> 14:52.935
Yell at me, Dad, will you?

14:53.101 --> 14:55.145
Hit me with your cane.

14:55.312 --> 14:57.523
Just don't stand there.

15:06.114 --> 15:08.492
Let me see if I've got this right.

15:08.659 --> 15:12.871
In the last year, you give
my chair away, you lose my dog

15:13.038 --> 15:15.290
and now you demolish my bar.

15:15.457 --> 15:19.294
Next I'll find out you're the one
who shot me in the hip!

15:20.879 --> 15:24.716
- I have an alibi for that one.
- You have one for everything.

15:24.883 --> 15:28.804
It wasn't on purpose.
I'm part of an investment group.

15:28.971 --> 15:34.601
You watched me and my friends
get all weepy and didn't say anything.

15:35.477 --> 15:39.523
What did you want us to say?
"Fellas, here's something ironic..."

15:40.607 --> 15:42.734
Why didn't you at least tell me?

15:44.069 --> 15:46.363
I don't know, I...

15:47.114 --> 15:48.824
I guess...

15:48.991 --> 15:53.120
Maybe it was because,
when you invited me to Duke's,

15:53.287 --> 15:58.250
it felt like we were getting closer.
It was a momentous step.

15:58.417 --> 16:00.878
- It was a beer!
- Not to me.

16:01.044 --> 16:03.714
It was validation.

16:03.881 --> 16:08.093
Finally, I was one of the guys
you wanted to hang out with.

16:10.179 --> 16:12.723
I didn't want to spoil that.

16:12.890 --> 16:14.933
I'd have asked you before

16:15.100 --> 16:20.439
but I just figured it was the kinda place
you'd look down your nose at.

16:20.606 --> 16:23.066
Well, you're probably right.

16:24.568 --> 16:26.695
Anyway, I'm sorry.

16:31.909 --> 16:36.121
- Maybe I spent too much time there.
- What do you mean?

16:36.288 --> 16:40.792
When you were growing up.
lf I'd spent less time at Duke's

16:40.959 --> 16:44.213
and more with you,
I wouldn't have a son

16:44.379 --> 16:47.007
who puts so much stock in one beer.

16:48.258 --> 16:52.304
You know, I was having
a pretty good time at Duke's.

16:52.471 --> 16:57.726
Till I found I was responsible for
wiping it off the face of the planet.

16:57.893 --> 17:00.979
I liked having you there, too, son.

17:02.105 --> 17:04.148
Thanks, Dad.

17:06.859 --> 17:11.031
Do you mind? It's driving me crazy.
It looks like hell.

17:18.121 --> 17:22.251
Know what? We got a few hours
before the wrecking ball comes.

17:22.416 --> 17:25.878
- How about you and I go down there?
- To Duke's?

17:26.046 --> 17:27.964
- Yeah.
- Now?

17:28.131 --> 17:30.008
- Yeah.
- You and me?

17:30.175 --> 17:34.054
- Not this again!
- Yeah. All right, great.

17:34.221 --> 17:37.099
Just you, me and Charlie Ballantine.

17:38.183 --> 17:41.228
Meet you right back here in a minute.

17:42.271 --> 17:45.983
Oh, good evening, Daphne.
Or should I say good morning?

17:47.401 --> 17:51.947
- How was your date with Derek?
- We had a wonderful time.

17:52.614 --> 17:55.409
We went to dinner,
then to the symphony,

17:55.659 --> 18:00.622
then we took a lovely moonlight stroll
through the park.

18:00.789 --> 18:02.875
He's the perfect gentleman.

18:17.055 --> 18:21.226
Apparently in England,
it's the fourth date.

18:24.396 --> 18:25.397
(# "Danny Boy")

18:25.564 --> 18:29.401
# I'll be here

18:29.568 --> 18:36.241
# In sunshine or in shadow

18:36.408 --> 18:42.581
# Oh, Danny Boy, oh, Danny Boy

18:42.748 --> 18:48.921
# I love you so #

18:52.424 --> 18:56.261
That's good.
It reminds me of old Micky Dougan.

18:57.137 --> 18:59.932
One 4th July,
we were on mounted patrol

19:00.098 --> 19:03.477
in a big parade down Broad Street.

19:03.644 --> 19:06.647
It was a scorcher.
Must have been 100%F.

19:06.813 --> 19:10.651
I'm sitting on a thousand pounds
of hot, sweaty horse.

19:10.817 --> 19:14.905
I must have been complaining
because, as we ride by Duke's,

19:15.072 --> 19:18.408
Micky says, "lf you want a beer
so bad, get one!"

19:18.575 --> 19:23.497
So I ride through the front door,
up to the bar and order a beer.

19:24.248 --> 19:28.418
Duke plays it cool and says,
"What'll your friend have?"

19:28.585 --> 19:30.712
I say, "Nothing, he's driving."

19:33.590 --> 19:37.386
- I've told you that one before, haven't I?
- Yeah.

19:38.679 --> 19:41.223
Oh, what a place!

19:41.974 --> 19:45.143
- Another beer, Dad?
- Sure, why not?

19:47.020 --> 19:49.273
Sun's up.

19:52.150 --> 19:57.531
I look around this place
in the golden early morning light...

19:57.698 --> 20:02.286
It's still a dump.
I'm going to miss it, though.

20:03.579 --> 20:06.915
I know what it is
to have a neighbourhood bar.

20:07.082 --> 20:12.171
I remember the last time I walked
out of my old watering hole in Boston.

20:13.130 --> 20:16.633
It was a strangely emotional day.

20:18.051 --> 20:20.304
It's the people, I guess.

20:21.597 --> 20:24.433
Saying goodbye to a lot of people.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.768
Saying goodbye to this place

20:26.935 --> 20:30.772
doesn't mean you can't see
your buddies as much as ever.

20:32.357 --> 20:34.401
Yeah, it does.

20:36.028 --> 20:38.155
Yeah, you're right.

20:45.037 --> 20:49.833
But that's life. You move on.
Only a fool tries to fight it.

20:54.671 --> 20:58.091
- What are you doing?
- Stopping the demolition. And you?

20:58.258 --> 21:01.553
- Saying goodbye.
- You may not have to.

21:01.720 --> 21:06.683
I intend to stand here
and face down the bulldozers.

21:06.934 --> 21:10.229
No need. I've talked to Dad.
He forgives us.

21:10.395 --> 21:15.359
- Sure, Son. Don't worry. It's OK.
- Is it really? I think not!

21:16.693 --> 21:19.947
Today it's Duke's,
but tomorrow it's Mo's

21:20.113 --> 21:23.033
and the day after,
it's Ernie's Taproom.

21:23.283 --> 21:26.036
I'm not just here for you, Dad.

21:26.286 --> 21:31.416
I'm doing this for every little guy
who's found solace after a hard day

21:31.583 --> 21:34.127
by bellying up at his local bar.

21:34.378 --> 21:37.256
I'll show faceless, corporate America

21:37.422 --> 21:40.676
they can't just
shove the little guy aside.

21:40.843 --> 21:44.346
Even when I'm
that faceless, corporate America.

21:44.513 --> 21:49.226
I'm here to fight the good fight,
to show those rat-faced heathens

21:49.476 --> 21:53.355
there's still some fury
in the heart of John Q Public.

22:05.409 --> 22:09.997
On the other hand, who am l
to stand in the way of progress?

22:13.458 --> 22:18.964
# Hey baby, I hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:19.131 --> 22:20.507
# Quite stylish!

22:20.674 --> 22:27.431
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Well, maybe, but I got you pegged

22:27.598 --> 22:33.270
# But I don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:33.437 --> 22:36.023
# They're calling again #

22:36.190 --> 22:39.151
Good night everybody!

22:40.305 --> 22:46.354
