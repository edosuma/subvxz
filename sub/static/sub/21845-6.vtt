00:01.390 --> 00:05.480
Scotland Yard and the newspaper reporters are calling the killer

00:06.650 --> 00:08.730
Jack the Ripper.

00:08.730 --> 00:10.230
A little missing?

00:10.230 --> 00:14.700
Yes, a little missing. Like a uterus.

00:14.700 --> 00:19.330
That is correct. It would have been impossible for the viscount or anyone in his household.

00:19.330 --> 00:22.120
Sebastian… Impossible!

00:22.120 --> 00:25.620
“Jack the Ripper” could be none other

00:25.620 --> 00:29.290
than Madam Red and Greil Sutcliffe!

00:29.290 --> 00:31.670
You should

00:32.610 --> 00:35.630
never have been born!

00:41.020 --> 00:42.900
I just can’t.

00:43.630 --> 00:45.690
I can’t kill this child.

00:45.690 --> 00:48.270
I am so disappointed, Madam Red!

00:49.270 --> 00:52.610
I have no interest in you if you’re just like all the other women!

01:19.050 --> 01:21.810
A demon and a Reaper.

01:22.770 --> 01:26.270
Ah, I wonder if it really is impossible for us to understand one another.

01:27.330 --> 01:29.700
The fleeting memories that we were allowed together…

01:29.700 --> 01:33.440
It’s as if we’re in a Romeo and Juliet-esque tragedy!

01:36.070 --> 01:40.320
Ah, Sebby, wherefore art thou Sebby?

01:45.340 --> 01:48.680
If you were to throw away that repulsive name forced upon you by your master

01:48.680 --> 01:50.580
and only look at me…

01:51.540 --> 01:53.600
I will say just one thing.

01:53.600 --> 01:56.640
From the moment my master named me Sebastian,

01:56.640 --> 02:00.530
I was baptised in the contract,

02:00.530 --> 02:03.270
and from that day forth, I truly became Sebastian,

02:04.060 --> 02:05.520
as I vowed by the moon.

02:05.520 --> 02:08.680
A vow that sways as the moon waxes and wanes?

02:08.680 --> 02:10.150
You are quite the inconsistent man.

02:10.940 --> 02:14.690
Your eyes are filled with an impurity that loves absolutely nothing.

02:14.690 --> 02:18.950
You are a demon that befouls pure souls with your hands and lips.

02:18.950 --> 02:22.870
Ah, how splendid you are. You give me chills, Sebby!

02:22.870 --> 02:25.370
I want to have your babies!

02:25.370 --> 02:27.710
Please stop. That is disgusting.

02:27.710 --> 02:30.290
My, how cold you are.

02:33.250 --> 02:34.590
The beautiful tyrant.

02:35.880 --> 02:38.300
The angelic demon!

02:38.300 --> 02:40.470
A crow with heart-shaped wings!

02:41.820 --> 02:43.430
Sebby.

02:45.060 --> 02:47.590
Ah, Sebby,

02:47.590 --> 02:50.250
if only morning would never come,

02:50.250 --> 02:55.520
we would be able to continue our love like this forever.

02:55.520 --> 02:58.960
But our adventure must end here.

03:01.280 --> 03:04.110
Let us part with a passionate kiss.

03:04.110 --> 03:07.630
A thousand farewells!

03:13.380 --> 03:19.010
Now, allow me to see your drastic and dramatic record!

03:22.180 --> 03:23.560
-Op- His Butler, At the Funeral

<font size="50"><font color="#2f281c">His Butler,</font></font>

05:05.950 --> 05:10.030
H—Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

05:10.030 --> 05:13.500
Just what the hell is this?

05:16.560 --> 05:19.880
This past year has been filled with nothing but that, after all.

05:19.880 --> 05:23.770
I have no interest in such domestic flashbacks!

05:24.550 --> 05:26.340
Show me the good bits!

05:26.340 --> 05:30.720
I’m sorry, but the rest is pay-per-view.

05:30.720 --> 05:31.920
Stingy!

05:35.850 --> 05:39.850
Ah, my clothes are all ruined again.

05:41.080 --> 05:42.690
This is completely gone.

05:42.690 --> 05:46.450
To be worried about your clothes in a situation like this, you must be quite laidback, no?

05:46.450 --> 05:51.580
But I like a well-groomed man, Sebby.

05:54.610 --> 05:57.950
It was not my wish to employ this sort of tactic,

05:58.900 --> 06:00.170
but I have no choice.

06:01.450 --> 06:04.110
You’re finally going to be serious with me, then?

06:05.130 --> 06:08.040
Let’s put an end to this with the next blow.

06:08.450 --> 06:13.760
Farewell to this world. Let us be bonded to each other in the next, Sebby!

06:33.410 --> 06:37.870
That dress jacket is made from the finest Yorkshire wool.

06:37.870 --> 06:41.550
You will find that there is a lot of friction in wool production.

06:41.550 --> 06:44.450
Once it is woven, it is quite hard to tear apart.

06:44.450 --> 06:47.590
No way!

06:48.440 --> 06:50.510
It was one of the items I brought from the mansion,

06:50.510 --> 06:52.640
so I did not want to have to use it.

06:52.640 --> 06:56.710
However, you had already ruined it.

06:59.130 --> 07:05.020
Well then, I have a bit of confidence in plain fist fights.

07:05.020 --> 07:07.490
W—Wait a minute…

07:07.490 --> 07:09.500
Please, not the face!

07:17.900 --> 07:19.960
Not the face!

07:24.500 --> 07:28.130
Stop it!

07:34.570 --> 07:37.500
I apologise. I misjudged the distance.

07:38.350 --> 07:39.730
You’re in quite a state.

07:39.730 --> 07:42.060
I had a little resistance, so…

07:43.850 --> 07:45.020
Remember this!

07:45.890 --> 07:50.530
My, that’s a Reaper for you. I suppose you would not die from blows alone.

07:52.100 --> 07:55.010
Well then, how about this?

07:55.010 --> 07:57.160
A Reaper’s scythe is able to cut through anything,

07:58.720 --> 08:00.080
which means

08:00.080 --> 08:02.240
it should be able to cut through you, right?

08:02.240 --> 08:03.870
Wh—What are you thinking?

08:03.870 --> 08:04.970
Sto— Stop—

08:06.680 --> 08:10.760
It is quite unpleasant to be stepped upon. Doing the stepping, however, feels quite good.

08:11.730 --> 08:12.970
It hurts!

08:12.970 --> 08:17.300
Young Master, even though this hideous reprobate is a Reaper, a god of death,

08:17.300 --> 08:21.220
are you prepared to accept the consequences of killing him?

08:21.220 --> 08:24.450
Are you trying to make me give the same order twice?

08:25.000 --> 08:25.480
Understood.

08:26.160 --> 08:28.270
Ah, it hurts! It hurts!

08:28.270 --> 08:31.540
My, you do have quite an attractive screaming voice.

08:31.540 --> 08:32.659
Let me reward you.

08:33.990 --> 08:37.260
I will let you depart via this beloved toy of yours!

08:37.260 --> 08:39.120
Please stop!

08:40.360 --> 08:41.080
Don’t want to.

08:41.080 --> 08:43.620
Don’t you want to know who killed your parents?

08:54.320 --> 08:56.780
Forgive me for interrupting you mid-conversation.

08:59.380 --> 09:02.690
I am one of the supervisors of the Reaper Dispatch Organisation,

09:02.690 --> 09:05.690
William T. Spears.

09:06.860 --> 09:09.440
I have come to take that Reaper back.

09:09.440 --> 09:11.440
Will! William!

09:13.030 --> 09:14.530
You came to save m—

09:17.720 --> 09:19.790
Dispatcher Greil Sutcliffe,

09:19.790 --> 09:21.870
you have committed several regulation violations.

09:21.870 --> 09:25.140
First, the elimination of those not on the Candidate List.

09:25.140 --> 09:29.450
Next, the use of a non-sanctioned death-scythe.

09:29.450 --> 09:32.560
And finally, the disclosure of information

09:32.560 --> 09:36.430
pertaining to the lives and the circumstances of death of the aforementioned departed.

09:38.860 --> 09:41.740
I apologise profusely for any inconvenience caused by <i>this.</i>

09:42.060 --> 09:44.750
Ah, here is my business card.

09:46.520 --> 09:52.110
Honestly. Having to bow my head to vermin like you

09:52.110 --> 09:55.070
really does smear mud across the Reaper name.

09:55.810 --> 09:58.790
Well, in order for you not to cause the “vermin” further inconvenience,

09:58.790 --> 10:00.570
please keep a close watch.

10:01.780 --> 10:04.230
Humans are vulnerable to temptation.

10:04.230 --> 10:07.940
When they are forced to stand on the hellish precipice of despair,

10:07.940 --> 10:12.040
they will unfailingly take any route out of it that appears before them,

10:12.040 --> 10:14.210
no matter what kind of web it tangles them in,

10:14.550 --> 10:16.790
no matter what kind of person they are.

10:16.790 --> 10:22.140
The ones who take advantage of that and taunt humans are you demons, no?

10:23.120 --> 10:24.560
I am not denying that.

10:24.560 --> 10:27.110
I suppose that those dogs kept leashed as pets

10:27.110 --> 10:31.020
are better than the mad dogs that roam around with no principles.

10:31.020 --> 10:34.070
Well then, we shall return, Greil Sutcliffe.

10:34.070 --> 10:39.450
My goodness, at a time when we’re already short-handed, once again, I won’t get to leave today.

10:39.450 --> 10:42.170
Of course, the director will scold us anyway…

10:42.170 --> 10:43.620
If I keep having to do overtime like this—

10:50.280 --> 10:51.630
You forgot that.

10:51.630 --> 10:53.290
Thank you.

10:57.710 --> 10:59.910
Well then, excuse us.

11:07.640 --> 11:09.700
I must apologise.

11:09.700 --> 11:13.020
Half of Jack the Ripper escaped.

11:15.450 --> 11:19.280
It’s fine. It’s over.

11:20.860 --> 11:22.970
You are rather chilly.

11:23.510 --> 11:25.650
Let us return to the townhouse post haste.

11:25.650 --> 11:27.580
I shall prepare some hot milk.

11:28.620 --> 11:29.790
Yeah.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.020
Young Master!

11:37.830 --> 11:38.360
Young Ma—

11:38.360 --> 11:38.800
It’s fine!

11:39.830 --> 11:42.450
I can stand on my own.

11:44.850 --> 11:46.100
It’s just…

11:46.100 --> 11:49.090
I’m slightly fatigued.

12:04.630 --> 12:06.420
Big brother!

12:07.790 --> 12:11.430
Bro, there are lots of people here today.

12:11.430 --> 12:12.510
Why?

12:12.510 --> 12:13.170
Dunno.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.420
Even though you’re our big brother, you don’t know?

12:16.420 --> 12:17.380
Stupid?

12:18.180 --> 12:21.440
I’m only twelve, so I don’t have to know, either!

12:21.440 --> 12:23.020
That’s right.

12:23.630 --> 12:27.770
It’s natural for a normal twelve-year-old not to know.

12:27.770 --> 12:32.050
Today is the grandest of parties for a certain mistress.

12:32.830 --> 12:34.560
A grand party?

12:34.560 --> 12:39.020
Yes. The final and largest ceremony of a lifetime,

12:39.020 --> 12:41.500
a funeral.

12:41.500 --> 12:44.310
And the chaff died, and fell upon the earth,

12:44.310 --> 12:48.100
and finally became sustenance through water to nurture the living.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.810
And to bring closure to the far off future,

12:50.810 --> 12:54.770
those who live will pass through the gateway to death…

12:52.790 --> 12:54.770
Auntie Anne.

12:55.750 --> 12:59.630
…will pass through the gateway to death.

13:05.550 --> 13:06.640
Ciel!

13:11.420 --> 13:12.280
That’s…

13:12.280 --> 13:13.560
The Phantomhive.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.200
A red dress?

13:15.200 --> 13:16.700
How improper!

13:16.700 --> 13:20.090
But the madam loved red so dearly.

13:34.660 --> 13:39.200
Neither white flowers nor plain clothes suit you.

13:40.130 --> 13:43.720
What suits you is the red of passion,

13:44.510 --> 13:46.840
the colour of liquorice burning the landscape,

13:48.470 --> 13:49.800
Aunt Anne.

14:58.840 --> 14:59.970
Rest well,

15:02.460 --> 15:04.230
Madam Red.

15:13.190 --> 15:15.620
It must be about time for the funeral.

15:15.620 --> 15:18.390
To think that the madam will never pay us another visit…

15:18.390 --> 15:20.290
It really makes you feel lonely.

15:21.140 --> 15:23.310
Why have you got such a depressed look on your faces?

15:23.310 --> 15:26.650
It’s at times like these that we must provide support!

15:26.650 --> 15:27.230
Yes!

15:32.340 --> 15:34.610
You have departed, haven’t you?

15:34.610 --> 15:36.820
You’ve gone to the place of your beloved,

15:37.500 --> 15:39.500
Lady Angelina.

15:46.380 --> 15:49.410
You’re still here? The investigation is over.

15:49.410 --> 15:52.690
But I cannot accept that!

15:52.690 --> 15:56.260
Aren’t we of Scotland Yard here to protect the citizens?

15:56.260 --> 15:59.120
Our country, Great Britain, has a long and deep history.

15:59.120 --> 16:01.700
The more we have, the more old entanglements there are

16:01.700 --> 16:04.190
that are part of the underground society that we must not touch upon.

16:05.120 --> 16:10.570
This case was judged to have been resolved through the laws of that underground society.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.790
Judged? Who by?

16:12.790 --> 16:14.980
If you want to find out, keep on looking.

16:14.980 --> 16:19.750
However, once you do, you’ll regret it.

16:19.750 --> 16:22.210
It would have been better to have never known…

16:23.710 --> 16:27.530
Are you not going to report the true identity of Jack the Ripper to Her Majesty?

16:27.530 --> 16:33.010
There is no need for that. Her wish was simply for the case to be brought to an end.

16:33.010 --> 16:35.010
That has been accomplished.

16:35.010 --> 16:39.720
And just like that, you will continue to be dragged down into the quicksand.

16:40.570 --> 16:45.190
Even if you came to a place you could no longer return from,

16:45.190 --> 16:49.400
you would never show anyone your weakness by asking for help.

16:49.400 --> 16:52.440
You are the Queen’s Guard Dog, and proud with it.

16:52.440 --> 16:56.850
I will also try not to cause you any trouble, Earl.

16:57.590 --> 17:01.180
The existence of these “opium dens” is starting to become troublesome.

17:01.180 --> 17:03.390
If you’re going to pull out, now is the time.

17:03.390 --> 17:07.750
If that were the case, I’d move into another business.

17:08.420 --> 17:11.579
You also have the option of returning to your country.

17:12.380 --> 17:15.880
I still haven’t run out of interest in this country.

17:15.880 --> 17:19.260
Nor in you, Earl.

17:19.980 --> 17:23.730
I am counting on you continuing to show me things of great interest.

17:25.829 --> 17:28.310
There’s somewhere I wish to stop by. Come.

17:31.070 --> 17:31.900
This is…

17:31.900 --> 17:35.280
My last guest from the Jack the Ripper case.

17:36.090 --> 17:38.590
It seems that she was an immigrant.

17:38.590 --> 17:41.260
We could not find anyone to take care of the body.

17:41.260 --> 17:49.160
That’s why the kind earl had me do her make-up, and went as far as to arrange a grave for her.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.090
It wasn’t out of kindness.

17:51.090 --> 17:57.430
That night, if we had prioritised saving this woman’s life, there would have been many ways to do it.

17:57.430 --> 18:02.640
However, deciding against that, I instead prioritised capturing Jack the Ripper.

18:03.540 --> 18:06.100
I knew that I wouldn’t be able to save her

18:06.100 --> 18:09.430
and, in that knowledge, I stood by as she was killed.

18:09.430 --> 18:11.070
My relative also…

18:12.000 --> 18:13.780
Are you having regrets?

18:13.780 --> 18:15.220
I’m not.

18:15.220 --> 18:17.620
Jack the Ripper is no more.

18:17.620 --> 18:20.240
Queen Victoria’s distress has been lifted.

18:20.240 --> 18:23.700
Victoria, huh? I can’t quite like her.

18:23.700 --> 18:29.170
She just watches from high above and leaves all the difficult matters to you, Earl.

18:29.170 --> 18:32.620
This is the duty our family has shouldered.

18:32.620 --> 18:35.690
It is something that has been inherited from generation to generation along with this ring.

18:35.690 --> 18:38.980
That ring is like a collar.

18:38.980 --> 18:42.280
It connects you to the Queen through a chain called “duty”.

18:42.280 --> 18:44.060
The one who decided that was me!

18:44.060 --> 18:50.180
I pray that collar does not one day lop off your head.

18:50.690 --> 18:52.560
That would be too boring.

18:52.560 --> 18:55.900
If anything ever happens again, please do come by the shop.

18:55.900 --> 19:00.050
If it’s you and your butler, I’ll welcome you any time.

19:08.380 --> 19:10.070
How kind.

19:10.070 --> 19:13.280
Don’t make me repeat myself. This wasn’t kindness…

19:13.280 --> 19:14.670
It was kindness.

19:15.250 --> 19:19.090
If not, then it was weakness.

19:19.090 --> 19:20.190
You!

19:20.190 --> 19:22.550
Why didn’t you shoot?

19:22.550 --> 19:24.980
Standing by and watching a relative be killed?

19:25.620 --> 19:27.430
Lies do not impress me.

19:27.430 --> 19:32.690
At that time, if you had thought of shooting her, you would have shot her.

19:32.690 --> 19:37.440
However, due to your hesitation, even if I had told you to, you would not have taken up your gun.

19:38.210 --> 19:39.440
Why?

19:39.950 --> 19:44.160
Were you afraid to kill the madam with your own hands?

19:45.060 --> 19:47.680
Even if you could kill a woman you had no acquaintance with,

19:47.680 --> 19:50.320
you could not kill someone close to you?

19:52.960 --> 19:55.130
It’s because that’s your job.

19:58.120 --> 20:01.240
I thought you would protect me with your life.

20:01.240 --> 20:03.600
That’s why I did not shoot.

20:03.600 --> 20:07.410
Our contract states that, until my goal is fulfilled,

20:07.410 --> 20:11.720
you will become my power, and protect me without letting me die.

20:12.320 --> 20:15.990
Demons do not have a sense of loyalty or conviction, right?

20:15.990 --> 20:18.110
All they have are principles.

20:18.110 --> 20:22.730
That’s why, in order to fulfil your own principles, you will protect me, no matter what.

20:22.730 --> 20:23.530
Isn’t that right?

20:23.530 --> 20:26.530
Then, why did you stop me back then?

20:28.620 --> 20:32.330
As the madam was trying to kill me, there was hesitation in her eyes.

20:33.690 --> 20:37.930
She was not able to kill me, a relative.

20:37.930 --> 20:39.270
That’s what I thought.

20:40.590 --> 20:43.420
If you hesitate for even a moment, it can be fatal,

20:43.420 --> 20:44.890
just like in chess.

20:45.720 --> 20:49.170
She lost her next move through hesitation.

20:49.170 --> 20:50.850
That’s all there was to it.

20:55.210 --> 20:57.020
That’s why I will not hesitate.

21:03.060 --> 21:05.340
That’s how it has to be!

21:05.340 --> 21:10.120
You should use your pawns in the best way possible and keep struggling to live on,

21:10.120 --> 21:14.580
using the madam, myself, and all the other pawns within your reach.

21:15.460 --> 21:23.170
Even if the empty shells of pawns pile up beneath the throne, once the king is gone, the game is over.

21:24.100 --> 21:26.080
I will not stop moving forward.

21:26.080 --> 21:28.390
I will not regret a single step I have taken.

21:28.390 --> 21:31.690
That’s why I order you:

21:31.690 --> 21:34.060
Do not betray me,

21:34.060 --> 21:36.360
and do not leave my side!

21:38.060 --> 21:39.590
No matter what.

21:43.740 --> 21:46.790
Yes, my Lord!

21:48.280 --> 21:50.200
If you wish,

21:51.660 --> 21:54.130
I will follow you, no matter where you go.

21:59.060 --> 22:03.550
Even if the throne crumbles and the brilliant crown rusts,

22:03.550 --> 22:07.520
even if the empty shells of pawns pile up

22:07.520 --> 22:09.900
and we rest upon their decaying bodies,

22:09.900 --> 22:13.520
I will lie beside your small form.

22:14.570 --> 22:19.160
And until the last bell tolls, until that time…

22:42.340 --> 22:45.220
Nothing I say comes out right.

22:45.220 --> 22:47.980
I can't love without a fight.

22:47.980 --> 22:50.730
No one ever knows my name.

22:50.730 --> 22:53.440
When I pray for sun, it rains.

22:53.440 --> 22:56.150
I'm so sick of wasting time,

22:56.150 --> 22:58.860
but nothing's moving in my mind.

22:58.860 --> 23:01.610
Inspiration can't be found.

23:01.610 --> 23:03.820
I get up and fall, but...

23:03.820 --> 23:06.620
I'm alive!

23:06.620 --> 23:08.950
I'm alive!

23:08.950 --> 23:09.870
Oh yeah!

23:09.870 --> 23:13.290
Between the good and bad is where you'll find me,

23:13.290 --> 23:14.790
reaching for Heaven!

23:14.790 --> 23:17.550
I will fight!

23:17.550 --> 23:19.800
And I'll sleep when I die!

23:19.800 --> 23:22.510
I live my life!

23:22.970 --> 23:25.720
I'm alive!

23:25.720 --> 23:28.060
I'm alive!

23:28.060 --> 23:29.300
Oh yeah!

23:29.300 --> 23:32.440
Between the good and bad is where you'll find me,

23:32.440 --> 23:33.980
reaching for Heaven!

23:33.980 --> 23:36.730
I will fight!

23:36.730 --> 23:38.940
And I'll sleep when I die!

23:38.940 --> 23:44.450
I live my hard life!

23:44.450 --> 23:50.950
I live my life! I'm alive!

23:58.050 --> 24:01.200
The young master has received an order from the Queen

24:01.200 --> 24:04.340
to develop a suspicious village into a resort.

24:05.110 --> 24:09.550
To be given the discretion to do such vulgar jobs… Only our young master could have received such an unrefined task.

24:10.450 --> 24:13.800
The name of “Queen’s Guard Dog” is not just for show.

24:13.800 --> 24:16.760
It wags its tail and barks on command.

24:17.870 --> 24:19.930
Next time on Kuroshitsuji:

24:19.930 --> 24:22.200
His Butler, Travelling.

24:19.930 --> 24:26.770
<font size="50"><font color="#ffffff">His Butler, Travelling</font></font>

24:19.930 --> 24:26.770
<font size="35"><font color="#ffffff">Preview</font></font>

24:22.200 --> 24:25.470
After all, I am one hell of a butler.

24:26.770 --> 24:29.900
<font size="22" face="Californian FB">We shall await you next time...</font>
