00:00.442 --> 00:02.352
Previously on Rectify:

00:02.352 --> 00:03.953
I'd like to drive.

00:03.953 --> 00:06.467
It might be best if we got you
your license first.

00:06.467 --> 00:08.172
Don't put words in my mouth.

00:08.172 --> 00:09.956
Put something else in your mouth.

00:09.956 --> 00:11.853
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:11.853 --> 00:13.901
We need somebody right away.

00:13.901 --> 00:15.353
I'm available whenever.

00:17.829 --> 00:20.558
We need a new revenue stream,
and we need it quick.

00:20.558 --> 00:22.715
An high-quality
wheel rims is it.

00:22.715 --> 00:24.405
I just don't see it, son.

00:26.523 --> 00:29.818
Oh, my...

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:26.744 --> 01:28.378
Filters.

01:58.710 --> 02:01.345
He got it. He got his license.

02:01.379 --> 02:04.081
Oh, wow!

02:04.115 --> 02:06.984
We were gonna do this when we got back.

02:07.018 --> 02:08.519
Thank you, honey.

02:09.954 --> 02:12.422
What were you thinking, Daniel,

02:12.457 --> 02:14.424
besides destroying a
perfectly good kitchen?

02:14.459 --> 02:15.659
Honey, I know it looks bad now...

02:15.693 --> 02:17.861
I'm sorry. I-I misunderstood.

02:17.896 --> 02:20.597
Yeah. You did.

02:20.632 --> 02:25.035
Got overly enthusiastic, I guess.

02:25.069 --> 02:27.871
Well, it's done now.

02:27.906 --> 02:30.874
So, we need a plan for going forward.

02:30.909 --> 02:32.943
Yes, a plan.

02:32.977 --> 02:34.945
You got one?

02:35.947 --> 02:38.015
We're working on it, Ted.

02:38.049 --> 02:40.851
Okay.

02:40.885 --> 02:43.020
For now, can we settle on a few rules?

02:43.054 --> 02:46.023
Sure, Ted. Rules.

02:46.057 --> 02:49.293
No work before 9:00 A.M. or after 6:00,

02:49.327 --> 02:50.761
no demolition

02:50.795 --> 02:53.597
before replacement supplies
are ready to install,

02:53.631 --> 02:54.943
and clean up as you go.

02:54.943 --> 02:57.201
We need to keep it
functional for the family.

02:57.226 --> 02:58.784
Of course.

02:59.337 --> 03:01.738
First things first.

03:01.773 --> 03:04.875
You need to replace some
of this damaged plywood.

03:04.909 --> 03:06.443
You gonna do vinyl again?

03:06.477 --> 03:09.446
No. That much I'm sure of. No, I got it.

03:09.480 --> 03:11.882
It's fine.

03:11.916 --> 03:14.084
Try that new lumber place
out there on Masseyville road.

03:14.118 --> 03:16.486
I'd go with you, but I'm
already running late for work.

03:16.521 --> 03:19.723
Take the truck.

03:19.757 --> 03:20.824
You mind?

03:20.858 --> 03:23.060
Uh, no, of course not. Uh...

03:23.094 --> 03:24.995
Oh.

03:31.703 --> 03:35.906
Well... good luck.

03:41.779 --> 03:45.349
He'll be all right. He's
just surprised, is all.

03:45.383 --> 03:46.783
Of course he is.

03:46.818 --> 03:51.221
I'm... I'm sorry. I just thought it was...

03:53.358 --> 03:54.958
I don't know.

03:54.993 --> 03:57.027
It's gonna be great.

03:57.061 --> 04:00.664
I'm very excited about everything.

04:00.698 --> 04:03.133
You're a good sport, Mother.

04:07.205 --> 04:10.974
I'll go get changed.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.191
Oh.

04:28.226 --> 04:29.860
Still here.

04:29.894 --> 04:33.664
Yeah, I was just, uh,
checking out your book.

04:33.698 --> 04:37.300
I see.

04:37.335 --> 04:40.137
I'll, uh... I'll step
out so you can change.

04:40.171 --> 04:42.205
That's okay, Teddy.

04:56.054 --> 05:00.223
"Love may be of the seen and of the unseen,

05:00.258 --> 05:03.660
"of the present, of the absent.

05:03.695 --> 05:06.229
"Consequently, a thing to be loved

05:06.264 --> 05:09.032
"is not so adapted to faith,

05:09.067 --> 05:10.867
"as a thing to be hoped for,

05:10.902 --> 05:14.638
since hope is always of
the absent and the unseen."

05:17.909 --> 05:20.310
Pretty intense.

05:24.415 --> 05:28.585
I don't understand a
lot of it, truth be told.

05:28.619 --> 05:32.222
Sometimes, I just let it wash over me,

05:32.256 --> 05:36.059
see what sticks.

05:36.094 --> 05:38.295
I like that.

05:40.465 --> 05:43.934
I like you.

05:43.968 --> 05:48.071
I like you, too, Teddy...

05:48.106 --> 05:49.906
Sometimes.

05:49.941 --> 05:54.544
Want to shake on it, friend?

06:04.822 --> 06:07.991
You're smart, Tawney.

06:08.025 --> 06:10.427
I know I probably don't say it enough,

06:10.461 --> 06:13.230
or maybe never.

06:13.264 --> 06:17.601
I am really sorry for
the way I've been acting.

06:20.972 --> 06:24.174
Well, today's a new day.

06:26.978 --> 06:30.247
Can't get so angry, Teddy.

06:30.281 --> 06:32.415
I know.

06:32.450 --> 06:36.019
It'll consume you.

06:36.053 --> 06:39.022
I know.

06:39.056 --> 06:42.225
Then it'll consume us.

06:46.864 --> 06:50.066
See? Smart.

06:59.544 --> 07:01.745
I hope it's a good day for you, Tawney.

07:05.750 --> 07:07.751
You too.

07:31.101 --> 07:34.036
Your light's not on.

07:35.072 --> 07:39.242
Oh. Right.

07:39.276 --> 07:41.511
Thank you.

07:43.914 --> 07:46.756
How was Peanut's labor?

07:46.756 --> 07:49.485
Um, I don't know about that. I'm new.

07:49.520 --> 07:52.155
Sorry.

07:54.258 --> 07:56.859
Dang thing gets stuck
every once in a while,

07:56.894 --> 07:58.327
from what I hear.

08:00.731 --> 08:04.567
You are doing just fine... "Amantha."

08:06.370 --> 08:07.737
Ow.

08:07.771 --> 08:10.339
Um, your total is $19.11.

08:11.808 --> 08:13.259
Yeah, I don't know about Peanut's baby

08:13.259 --> 08:15.976
or her labor or anything,
but I can find out for you

08:15.976 --> 08:18.514
- if you'd like, ma'am.
- Oh, that's sweet of you.

08:19.650 --> 08:21.517
Did you, um, enter the P.I.N.?

08:21.552 --> 08:22.952
P.I.N.'s in.

08:22.986 --> 08:26.122
Will you swipe it again?

08:30.961 --> 08:35.565
I think I'm just gonna have
to cancel it and start over.

08:38.635 --> 08:40.102
Or better yet...

08:40.136 --> 08:42.772
Wynn...

08:42.806 --> 08:44.874
I need you, like, right away, Wynn,

08:44.908 --> 08:47.376
like, right away.

08:47.411 --> 08:50.780
Sorry, y'all.

08:50.814 --> 08:51.981
Register's acting loopy.

08:55.960 --> 08:57.639
Please say, "I need a manager

08:57.639 --> 08:59.388
on check stand two, please, a manager."

08:59.423 --> 09:03.025
But you're the only manager.

09:03.860 --> 09:08.631
- Swipe it again, please, Ginny.
- Okay.

09:08.665 --> 09:10.066
You doing cash for the rest?

09:10.100 --> 09:12.902
Yep.

09:12.936 --> 09:15.671
That's EBT she's using.

09:15.706 --> 09:17.673
Food items only.

09:17.708 --> 09:19.466
Otherwise, it'll reject the transaction.

09:19.466 --> 09:20.903
EBT?

09:20.903 --> 09:24.947
Oh, food stamps?

09:26.316 --> 09:27.483
Assistance.

09:27.517 --> 09:28.985
And it's right there on the screen.

09:30.554 --> 09:31.687
How's Peanut?

09:31.722 --> 09:33.322
Let me tell you the scoop...

09:33.357 --> 09:36.259
Nine hours of labor, no epidural.

09:36.293 --> 09:40.296
Baby's a boy named Wyatt Andrew.

09:40.330 --> 09:44.267
Tips the scale at a
solid 11 pounds, 5 ounces.

09:44.301 --> 09:46.135
Good God!

09:47.971 --> 09:50.106
Sorry.  It's just a...

09:50.140 --> 09:51.607
A huge dang kid.

09:54.211 --> 09:56.979
Might be a while before
Peanut's back on her feet.

10:00.250 --> 10:01.550
Thank you.

10:01.585 --> 10:03.719
- Oh.
- You have a nice day.

10:03.754 --> 10:05.154
Who's next?

10:05.188 --> 10:06.222
Bye.

10:19.703 --> 10:21.504
This felt like the best corner.

10:21.538 --> 10:22.805
You know, you can see it from the road,

10:22.839 --> 10:24.373
but it's not blocking anything.

10:24.408 --> 10:26.842
I figured we'd get the
drive-bys and the looky-loos.

10:26.877 --> 10:28.711
I was clear when we discussed this,

10:28.745 --> 10:30.346
I did not authorize you
to use company funds.

10:30.380 --> 10:34.750
It's not company funds, dad. It's my funds.

10:34.785 --> 10:37.153
Where did you get the
money to pay for all this?

10:37.187 --> 10:38.154
Got a bank loan.

10:38.188 --> 10:39.255
A loan?

10:39.289 --> 10:41.057
Secured with what?

10:41.091 --> 10:43.392
It's not your concern, dad.

10:45.429 --> 10:47.563
You put up your house.

10:47.597 --> 10:49.899
Yep.

10:49.933 --> 10:51.400
Oh, son.

10:51.435 --> 10:54.837
It's gonna be okay, dad.

10:54.871 --> 10:59.075
I feel it in my bones.
Change is inevitable.

10:59.109 --> 11:01.544
You got to get out in front of it.

12:06.877 --> 12:09.278
You a browser or a buyer?

12:09.312 --> 12:12.481
One of them.

12:12.516 --> 12:14.417
Well, let me know if you decide

12:14.451 --> 12:18.320
to cross over the
threshold into consumerism.

12:21.892 --> 12:26.495
Actually, I am looking
for something specifically.

12:26.530 --> 12:27.930
Well, I like that...

12:27.964 --> 12:31.300
Sometimes.

12:31.334 --> 12:34.136
A Wedgewood stove.

12:34.171 --> 12:35.438
How many burners?

12:35.472 --> 12:36.439
Four.

12:36.473 --> 12:38.441
Single broiler? Oven?

12:38.475 --> 12:39.975
Yes.

12:40.010 --> 12:44.180
Storage compartment/warmer
or all oven below?

12:44.214 --> 12:45.815
Either, I suppose.

12:45.849 --> 12:48.017
How wide?

12:48.051 --> 12:50.453
36 to 40 inches.

12:50.487 --> 12:52.455
Good working condition, I'd imagine.

12:52.489 --> 12:54.490
It's preferable, yes.

12:54.524 --> 12:56.358
White, black, blue?

12:56.393 --> 12:57.626
Black.

12:57.661 --> 13:00.663
Nope. Don't have a Wedgewood.

13:04.401 --> 13:08.370
Do you have any stoves at all?

13:08.405 --> 13:09.839
Not really.

13:09.873 --> 13:12.408
Used to keep a mess of
them old-timey things.

13:12.442 --> 13:14.009
Couldn't give 'em away.

13:14.044 --> 13:16.011
Now you can't keep 'em.

13:16.046 --> 13:20.216
The new south bourgeoisie.

13:20.250 --> 13:22.418
You part of that group?

13:24.454 --> 13:27.656
Uh, I don't think I qualify.

13:27.691 --> 13:30.059
Eh, they got enough of
that trickle-down money

13:30.093 --> 13:34.063
makes 'em want to buy
some culture or class or...

13:34.097 --> 13:36.899
Or maybe they're just fish.

13:36.933 --> 13:39.702
Hell, I don't know. I just
try to oblige when I can.

13:39.736 --> 13:42.538
So some of that money trickles down to you.

13:42.572 --> 13:43.739
Well, why the hell not?

13:43.773 --> 13:46.208
I'm as much of a patriot as they are.

13:46.243 --> 13:49.745
I just like old stoves.

14:16.640 --> 14:19.441
Well, uh, thank you for your time.

14:19.476 --> 14:22.077
You, uh, live around here?

14:22.112 --> 14:24.280
I do, yes.

14:24.314 --> 14:26.482
I'll send your request out to the universe

14:26.516 --> 14:30.319
and lay my ear to the
cosmic rails, as it were,

14:30.353 --> 14:32.288
wait for a reply.

14:32.322 --> 14:34.557
I'd appreciate that.

14:34.591 --> 14:37.960
You think I'm bullshitting, don't you?

14:37.994 --> 14:39.562
On the contrary.

14:39.596 --> 14:42.164
Here's my number. Give
me a call in a few days.

14:42.198 --> 14:44.400
And I'll let you know if I got a lead.

14:44.434 --> 14:45.801
Thank you. I will.

14:45.835 --> 14:47.903
Get out much?

14:47.938 --> 14:49.738
I'm sorry?

14:49.773 --> 14:53.809
You socialize, like, at night?

14:53.843 --> 14:55.811
- After dark?
- In theory.

14:55.845 --> 14:58.647
Well, in theory, I'm
having a party tonight.

14:58.682 --> 15:00.482
My address is on the card.

15:00.517 --> 15:02.117
So, if you're intrigued

15:02.152 --> 15:05.588
by the wild, weird, and wonderful...

15:05.622 --> 15:08.424
Okay, can't guarantee the "wonderful."

15:08.458 --> 15:09.792
But the others...

15:09.826 --> 15:12.094
Oh, good Lord God.

15:12.128 --> 15:14.597
Anyway, you'd be more than welcome.

15:14.631 --> 15:20.035
Why would you invite me to your home?

15:20.070 --> 15:22.538
You want me to be honest?

15:22.572 --> 15:25.374
I would, yes.

15:25.408 --> 15:29.445
You're about the loneliest
person I've ever seen.

15:29.479 --> 15:32.848
And if you come to one of my parties, son,

15:32.882 --> 15:37.052
you may still be lonely,
but you will not be alone.

15:37.087 --> 15:39.688
Or sober, if you so choose.

15:39.723 --> 15:42.224
Name's Lezley, with a "Z."

15:42.258 --> 15:45.461
Daniel.

15:45.495 --> 15:47.630
With a "D."

15:47.664 --> 15:49.832
Okay, Daniel with a "D."

15:49.866 --> 15:51.300
If I don't see you tonight

15:51.334 --> 15:53.469
and you don't feel like joining the fray,

15:53.503 --> 15:56.872
then you give me a call in
a few on the stove, hear?

15:56.906 --> 15:58.040
Will do.

16:01.629 --> 16:04.231
All due respect, madam District Attorney,

16:04.265 --> 16:06.033
have you been drinking?

16:06.067 --> 16:07.701
'Cause I can't imagine a sober person

16:07.735 --> 16:10.137
even considering offering
Daniel Holden a plea deal.

16:10.171 --> 16:13.573
And, as I said, nothing's
been offered yet, Senator.

16:13.608 --> 16:16.910
But I did want you to know
that I value your opinion.

16:16.945 --> 16:18.312
Well, my opinion is,

16:18.346 --> 16:21.048
you've forgotten the facts of this case.

16:21.082 --> 16:23.684
I've not forgotten the
details of this case,

16:23.718 --> 16:25.185
if that's what you meant.

16:25.219 --> 16:28.055
I'm no longer confident
that if I take this case

16:28.089 --> 16:31.058
to trial tomorrow I'd
be able to find 12 people

16:31.092 --> 16:33.680
who'd be willing to put
that man back on death row.

16:39.186 --> 16:43.356
So, you'd let him plea out of it...

16:43.390 --> 16:45.992
Because you're afraid of
your prosecutorial abilities

16:46.026 --> 16:47.293
in a trial?

16:47.327 --> 16:49.629
No, I'm looking at the evidence...

16:49.663 --> 16:52.265
No sperm clearly tying him to the victim.

16:52.299 --> 16:54.100
We know he's gonna claim forced confession.

16:54.134 --> 16:55.835
What if that confession gets thrown out?

16:55.869 --> 16:57.170
It won't get thrown out.

16:57.204 --> 17:00.173
What if that confession gets thrown out?

17:00.207 --> 17:03.710
We are down to the testimony
of our two key witnesses.

17:03.744 --> 17:06.945
Trey Willie stands by
his original testimony.

17:06.980 --> 17:08.548
That's in our favor.

17:08.582 --> 17:12.018
George Melton has dropped off the radar.

17:12.051 --> 17:16.222
Plea deal for time served.

17:16.256 --> 17:17.356
Plus 10.

17:17.391 --> 17:19.392
10 means he's out in what?

17:19.425 --> 17:21.627
Six? Eight?

17:21.662 --> 17:24.564
That's the kind of move
that can kill a career.

17:24.598 --> 17:30.002
Give me another option, Roland,
one that saves both of us.

17:30.037 --> 17:31.871
I'm open.

17:34.074 --> 17:37.710
Okay. "Codswallop."

17:39.379 --> 17:41.748
Uh, codswallop.

17:41.782 --> 17:45.852
Uh, a fish commonly abbreviated to "COD."

17:45.886 --> 17:48.354
Wrong. And you're down to 87 points.

17:48.388 --> 17:50.723
- It means "nonsense."
- Nonsense?

17:50.758 --> 17:54.861
As in, "Niles is incessantly
jabbering codswallop."

17:54.895 --> 17:56.596
- Niles?
- Niles.

17:56.630 --> 17:58.064
Incessantly jabbering.

17:58.098 --> 18:00.233
You almost get a point
back for that one, Mother.

18:01.468 --> 18:04.270
Hey. I'm at 92.

18:04.304 --> 18:07.106
And he's down to 87. You
want to scrape or read?

18:07.141 --> 18:09.242
Give me that.

18:09.276 --> 18:12.378
All right. Uh, "proscenium."

18:12.412 --> 18:15.047
- That's the arch in the theater.
- Apron of the stage.

18:15.082 --> 18:16.682
You got to pick harder words, brother.

18:21.822 --> 18:22.955
Hey.

18:22.990 --> 18:24.023
Hey.

18:24.057 --> 18:25.258
Amantha.

18:25.292 --> 18:28.895
Wow. This is really, uh...

18:28.929 --> 18:30.696
Wow.

18:30.731 --> 18:32.765
You want to help, honey?

18:32.800 --> 18:34.767
Oh, no. I just stopped by to do laundry.

18:34.802 --> 18:36.402
Ran out of quarters.

18:36.436 --> 18:37.770
Is that okay?

18:37.805 --> 18:39.071
Of course.

18:40.574 --> 18:43.943
Can't wait to see how it turns out.

18:43.977 --> 18:46.913
It's, uh, postmodern.

18:46.947 --> 18:48.981
Deconstructionist.

18:49.016 --> 18:51.083
It speaks with its absence.

18:52.352 --> 18:56.189
Y'all see in the paper?

18:57.457 --> 18:59.959
Gaines died.

19:07.100 --> 19:11.270
You know who, uh,
Rutherford Gaines was, Jared?

19:11.305 --> 19:13.139
Uh, wasn't he your lawyer?

19:13.173 --> 19:15.575
Young man knows more than he lets on.

19:15.609 --> 19:17.577
What else do you know, Jared?

19:17.611 --> 19:19.278
I don't know.

19:19.313 --> 19:21.247
You don't know what else you know?

19:21.281 --> 19:22.248
No.

19:22.282 --> 19:24.851
It's a family disease.

19:24.885 --> 19:28.654
How did Gaines die?

19:28.689 --> 19:32.825
Regret or cancer. I forget.

19:32.860 --> 19:35.628
He lived a long life, didn't he?

19:35.662 --> 19:37.630
May we all.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.603
I'm gonna go get some sandpaper.

19:43.637 --> 19:45.605
Excuse me.

19:45.639 --> 19:46.739
Excuse me.

20:28.348 --> 20:30.449
So, when did the wrecking
ball hit the kitchen?

20:31.785 --> 20:34.553
You at all worried that none
of you know what you're doing?

20:34.588 --> 20:35.721
Probably.

20:35.756 --> 20:39.158
You look tired, sweetheart.

20:39.192 --> 20:40.760
You been packing up your place?

20:43.030 --> 20:46.399
No, Mother. I got a job.

20:46.433 --> 20:48.234
Really? In Atlanta?

20:48.268 --> 20:50.069
No, in Paulie.

20:50.103 --> 20:51.070
What?

20:51.104 --> 20:52.605
Thrifty Town.

20:52.639 --> 20:55.574
- Seriously, where?
- They hardly ever hire.

20:55.609 --> 20:56.842
But as luck would have it,

20:56.877 --> 20:58.244
I walked in at just the right time.

20:58.278 --> 21:00.513
Peanut went out on maternity leave.

21:00.547 --> 21:03.916
I'm afraid I don't entirely
understand, Amantha.

21:03.951 --> 21:06.218
You are working for someone named Peanut?

21:06.253 --> 21:09.221
No, Mother. I am working because of Peanut.

21:09.256 --> 21:10.523
She's recovering.

21:10.557 --> 21:12.058
Why, honey?

21:12.092 --> 21:13.459
As I understand it,

21:13.493 --> 21:15.261
you need some time after
you deliver a child,

21:15.295 --> 21:18.264
especially an 11-pounder
like Wyatt Andrew.

21:18.298 --> 21:21.801
No, I mean why did you
take a job at Thrifty Town?

21:21.835 --> 21:25.805
Oh, well, let's see. I need money.

21:25.839 --> 21:29.475
I think that's about it.
You have any stain stick?

21:29.509 --> 21:32.945
Uh, I have pre-wash.

21:32.980 --> 21:36.382
That should do it.

21:36.416 --> 21:38.250
Thanks.

21:55.234 --> 21:56.902
Hard to believe we used
to park cars in here.

21:58.237 --> 22:02.808
Yes, we are what we don't throw away.

22:02.842 --> 22:06.244
Teddy bears and barbells.

22:06.279 --> 22:08.447
Your old bike.

22:08.481 --> 22:10.682
The tank.

22:12.919 --> 22:15.420
You rode that thing everywhere.

22:15.455 --> 22:16.555
People thought I was crazy,

22:16.589 --> 22:18.390
riding a bike to the grocery store

22:18.424 --> 22:21.259
when I could drive a perfectly good car.

22:26.532 --> 22:29.334
Communist.

22:29.369 --> 22:31.970
Your daddy put these baskets on.

22:32.005 --> 22:33.939
No offense, but you always reminded me

22:33.973 --> 22:35.907
of the wicked witch when you rode this.

22:35.942 --> 22:39.811
How could I possibly be offended?

22:44.884 --> 22:48.320
Why did you stop riding it?

22:50.556 --> 22:53.358
I don't think we need to tell sad stories.

22:53.393 --> 22:59.831
- Life's too short.
- That's exactly why we have to tell.

22:59.866 --> 23:01.867
It's about me, isn't it?

23:11.778 --> 23:13.745
Honey, I don't want to tell this.

23:13.780 --> 23:15.180
Please, mama,

23:15.214 --> 23:17.382
I can't fill in the gaps on my own.

23:17.416 --> 23:19.684
I need to hear.

23:25.024 --> 23:29.027
It was in 1995.

23:29.061 --> 23:31.429
July the 10th.

23:31.464 --> 23:33.698
I'd bought a new dress to wear...

23:33.733 --> 23:37.102
Yellow flowers, like a summer picnic dress.

23:37.136 --> 23:40.539
I-I grabbed it right before
the store closed that day.

23:40.573 --> 23:42.874
I have no idea why I bought that dress.

23:42.909 --> 23:44.876
It was perverse.

23:44.911 --> 23:47.546
And when the time came to go, I just...

23:50.716 --> 23:53.885
I-I just couldn't do it.

23:53.920 --> 23:55.587
Mr. Gaines said it was a formality,

23:55.621 --> 23:57.522
that the execution would be stayed again,

23:57.557 --> 24:00.125
but...

24:00.159 --> 24:02.961
Anyway, I just kept walking
up and down the stairs,

24:02.995 --> 24:04.896
checking the clock.

24:04.931 --> 24:08.099
Finally, I-I came out here. I saw my bike.

24:08.134 --> 24:10.468
Your dad heard the garage open

24:10.503 --> 24:13.271
and came out and asked me what was I doing.

24:13.306 --> 24:15.707
I said, "I'm... I'm gonna take a ride."

24:15.741 --> 24:18.310
"No, you're not." "Yes, I am."

24:18.344 --> 24:21.746
"Janet, don't make me get
in the car and follow you."

24:21.781 --> 24:25.617
I said, "let me be."

24:27.787 --> 24:29.154
And he did.

24:31.958 --> 24:35.760
Rode down the street...
And I rode through town,

24:35.795 --> 24:40.165
past the water tower, past the satellites,

24:40.199 --> 24:43.401
in that ridiculous yellow dress.

24:46.038 --> 24:49.441
I rode for I don't know how long,

24:49.475 --> 24:53.612
until I-I thought midnight had passed.

24:56.048 --> 24:58.650
When I stopped, I realized
that I'd run over a nail

24:58.684 --> 25:00.652
and the back tire was flat.

25:00.686 --> 25:02.854
I turned around,

25:02.889 --> 25:06.691
rode it the whole way home that way.

25:06.726 --> 25:08.693
I remember exactly where I was standing

25:08.728 --> 25:10.328
when your dad told me that they'd given you

25:10.363 --> 25:14.099
another stay... Right by the front door,

25:14.133 --> 25:18.503
by that old brass umbrella
stand with the swan on it.

25:20.206 --> 25:22.641
I remember he helped me to bed.

25:28.180 --> 25:32.484
I threw out that dress.

25:38.591 --> 25:41.993
I, uh, think I'm gonna
go make myself a sandwich.

25:42.028 --> 25:43.395
Would you like one?

25:43.429 --> 25:47.699
No, thank you.

26:18.272 --> 26:19.639
Who are you?

26:19.673 --> 26:21.874
I'm not sure.

26:21.909 --> 26:23.876
You look familiar.

26:23.911 --> 26:27.480
If you figure it out, will you let me know?

26:38.458 --> 26:41.828
God, I'm glad you're here.

26:41.862 --> 26:43.262
Kind of blew Mom's mind.

26:43.297 --> 26:45.898
Was that the point of getting a job at...

26:45.933 --> 26:46.933
Where, again?

26:46.967 --> 26:49.769
Thrifty town, jon.

26:49.803 --> 26:51.838
I am working at Thrifty Town

26:51.872 --> 26:54.273
because I literally cannot
afford to move to Atlanta,

26:54.308 --> 26:57.476
and Melvin is unyielding on any refunds

26:57.511 --> 26:59.011
of last month's rent and deposit.

26:59.046 --> 27:00.813
Well, he wants to keep you here forever.

27:00.848 --> 27:02.014
He's sweet.

27:02.049 --> 27:03.816
He's my competition.

27:06.053 --> 27:07.954
Actually, the idea of having

27:07.988 --> 27:10.356
something to show up for is a relief,

27:10.390 --> 27:12.191
to think of something other than...

27:12.226 --> 27:13.659
Yourself?

27:13.694 --> 27:18.097
I cannot believe you just said that.

27:18.131 --> 27:20.333
But maybe.

27:20.367 --> 27:22.935
Speaking of jobs...

27:22.970 --> 27:26.939
I got an interesting call from William.

27:26.974 --> 27:29.141
William from Justice Row?

27:29.176 --> 27:32.612
He called me at the airport.

27:32.646 --> 27:35.181
He said Peter Mullen's leaving

27:35.215 --> 27:37.650
and they need a replacement.

27:37.684 --> 27:39.485
And they're asking you?

27:39.519 --> 27:42.154
They're asking me.

27:42.189 --> 27:44.991
How long do you have to think about it?

27:45.025 --> 27:47.393
He wants me to call him on my way to Varner

27:47.427 --> 27:52.031
before Eddyville on Wednesday
and Riverbend on Friday.

27:52.065 --> 27:53.466
Death row tour?

27:53.500 --> 27:55.067
Should we print t-shirts?

27:55.102 --> 27:56.302
Hmm.

27:59.840 --> 28:02.508
I just need a change, you know?

28:04.912 --> 28:07.213
Would you consider Boston?

28:07.247 --> 28:11.150
Do I have to answer right now?

28:11.184 --> 28:13.586
Think about it?

28:13.620 --> 28:15.621
Okay.

28:18.725 --> 28:23.696
But first, we have some stuff

28:23.730 --> 28:26.699
that we really need to talk about.

28:26.733 --> 28:28.668
- Stuff?
- Yeah.

28:28.702 --> 28:31.504
It's super-secret, and...

28:31.538 --> 28:33.105
I'm not really sure

28:33.140 --> 28:35.107
we should even be out
here talking about it,

28:35.142 --> 28:37.944
because we don't know
who might be listening in.

28:37.978 --> 28:40.012
May have hidden microphones in the vents.

28:40.047 --> 28:43.049
Microphones.

28:43.083 --> 28:46.052
Wow.

28:46.086 --> 28:48.254
Do you think it...

28:48.288 --> 28:50.723
Do you think it would
be better in the bedroom?

28:50.757 --> 28:53.125
Maybe.

28:53.160 --> 28:55.695
We should probably check.

28:55.729 --> 28:58.564
I'll go that way. You go that way.

29:12.612 --> 29:15.214
Got the display all set up today.

29:15.248 --> 29:17.049
Even had a couple folks pop in after lunch

29:17.084 --> 29:19.218
to take a look around.

29:19.252 --> 29:21.220
Only a matter of time now, I know it.

29:21.254 --> 29:22.788
That's great.

29:22.823 --> 29:24.790
It is, right?

29:24.825 --> 29:27.460
Yeah, it really is.

29:31.999 --> 29:33.165
Uh-oh.

29:33.200 --> 29:35.167
You got the worried eyebrows.

29:35.202 --> 29:37.470
It's nothing.

29:40.474 --> 29:42.842
Which means it's something.

29:42.876 --> 29:45.678
Hmm.

29:45.712 --> 29:47.613
Well, it's just...

29:47.647 --> 29:50.783
I want to go to school.

29:50.817 --> 29:53.919
School.

29:53.954 --> 29:56.622
I know it's kind of out of the blue.

29:56.656 --> 29:58.858
- I just...
- What kind of school?

29:58.892 --> 29:59.859
College.

29:59.893 --> 30:01.994
I want to take classes...

30:02.029 --> 30:03.996
Night classes, I guess.

30:04.031 --> 30:06.732
Want to get my degree, eventually.

30:09.236 --> 30:11.037
Okay.

30:11.071 --> 30:13.472
Okay.

30:13.507 --> 30:17.376
So, you've been thinking
about this for a while.

30:17.411 --> 30:21.480
A little while, yeah.

30:21.515 --> 30:24.183
How come you haven't said anything?

30:24.217 --> 30:25.317
I don't know.

30:25.352 --> 30:28.721
Teddy, I guess...

30:32.526 --> 30:34.727
My period's late.

30:37.497 --> 30:40.666
Well, you're just full
of surprises tonight.

30:40.700 --> 30:44.403
I'm not trying to be.

30:44.438 --> 30:47.740
You've been late before.

30:47.774 --> 30:49.742
I know.

30:49.776 --> 30:52.311
This feels different.

30:52.345 --> 30:56.515
Different how?

30:56.550 --> 31:00.920
I don't know. More... real, I guess.

31:03.023 --> 31:06.192
Okay.

31:06.226 --> 31:08.394
Well...

31:08.428 --> 31:11.597
Should I go get one of those
tests from the drug store?

31:11.631 --> 31:14.333
I guess we should.

31:14.367 --> 31:18.104
Okay. Should I go right now?

31:18.138 --> 31:22.041
We can wait till tomorrow.

31:37.557 --> 31:40.126
Just us chickens?

31:40.160 --> 31:42.595
Just us chickens.

31:48.168 --> 31:51.137
You didn't handle that well this morning.

31:51.171 --> 31:53.572
He's a grown man, Janet.

31:53.607 --> 31:55.608
He's a damaged one, Ted.

31:55.642 --> 31:58.244
I know that, but he can't just do things

31:58.278 --> 32:00.913
and not face some responsibility for it.

32:00.947 --> 32:02.381
It seems to me that he's had

32:02.415 --> 32:04.783
more than his fair share
of being held responsible.

32:04.818 --> 32:06.085
I realize that.

32:06.119 --> 32:08.587
You don't know how hard this is on him.

32:10.257 --> 32:13.292
It's tough on everyone, even me.

32:13.326 --> 32:16.462
Why don't you tell me all
about how you've suffered?

32:16.496 --> 32:18.430
You're not listening.
No, you're not listening.

32:18.465 --> 32:20.833
You won't ever speak to him again
the way you spoke to him this morning.

32:20.867 --> 32:22.501
- I won't allow it.
- You won't allow it?

32:22.536 --> 32:24.770
He won't be treated like
that in his own home.

32:24.804 --> 32:26.338
Which is my home, too.

32:26.373 --> 32:28.541
It was his first.

32:30.677 --> 32:33.345
I'm going to bed.

33:54.776 --> 33:58.545
It was misguided at best.

33:58.580 --> 34:00.047
I think you're wrong, Lionel.

34:00.081 --> 34:01.882
I think what they were
trying to do is positive, man.

34:01.916 --> 34:03.651
It was doomed from the start.

34:03.685 --> 34:07.287
Occupy some dickhead's Cadillac
would have worked better.

34:07.322 --> 34:09.856
Yeah, like the Donalds' Eldorado.

34:09.856 --> 34:13.134
And this one! Chime in.

34:13.134 --> 34:16.426
Occupy movement. Pinpoint its failure.

34:16.460 --> 34:18.995
Occupy what?

34:19.029 --> 34:20.630
Exactly.

34:20.664 --> 34:22.831
All I know is revolution
ain't never been fomented

34:22.867 --> 34:26.002
by poor people sitting
on their ass in tents.

34:26.036 --> 34:28.438
Uh, the Russian revolution

34:28.472 --> 34:30.672
was started by peasants.

34:30.708 --> 34:32.609
Peasants, huh?

34:32.643 --> 34:35.178
I don't know if they
lived in tents, though.

34:35.212 --> 34:36.612
Tolstoy here talking about

34:36.647 --> 34:39.149
the Russian revolution like he was there.

34:41.518 --> 34:44.420
You're gonna need this, friend.

34:44.455 --> 34:46.922
I know you?

34:46.956 --> 34:50.592
I don't think so.

34:50.628 --> 34:52.495
You sure?

34:52.530 --> 34:53.530
Leave him alone, Lionel.

34:53.563 --> 34:55.764
Dude looks familiar.

34:55.799 --> 34:58.768
Enjoy your night.

34:58.802 --> 35:01.604
Yeah, that's my buddy Dan with a "D"!

35:01.639 --> 35:04.607
Give me a hand with this
thing. Grab the end of it.

35:04.642 --> 35:06.376
Grab it.

35:06.410 --> 35:10.313
I got it from an old queen in Ansley park,

35:10.347 --> 35:12.782
and it was not easy to talk him out of.

35:12.816 --> 35:14.017
Right in there.

35:14.051 --> 35:15.285
Ooh.

35:15.319 --> 35:17.053
Set it down right there. Thank you.

35:17.087 --> 35:21.296
Little squirrely one with
a rattail giving you shit?

35:21.330 --> 35:22.931
Oh, brother, please.

35:22.965 --> 35:24.799
Lionel gets here two hours early

35:24.834 --> 35:26.801
just to claim a spot on that old chair.

35:26.836 --> 35:28.637
He ain't got nothing else,

35:28.671 --> 35:31.106
except a two-inch pee-pee.

35:31.140 --> 35:32.941
Let me get us a shot of something.

35:32.975 --> 35:34.776
Hey, hey, now.

35:34.810 --> 35:37.212
Hold on, now, runaway train.
Where you headed?

35:37.246 --> 35:39.481
Home. I...

35:39.515 --> 35:41.651
Not allowed. Not yet.

35:41.651 --> 35:44.653
You came here for a reason.

35:44.687 --> 35:46.855
You best ride that out.

35:46.889 --> 35:49.024
What if I don't know the reason?

35:49.058 --> 35:54.229
Well, reason's known, yet
also for you to discover.

35:54.263 --> 35:55.797
I don't know what that means.

35:55.831 --> 35:58.967
But here, hook this around your belt loop.

35:59.001 --> 36:01.836
For the next hour,

36:01.871 --> 36:03.338
you and me gonna stay tethered,

36:03.372 --> 36:05.140
remain in a radius of each other,

36:05.174 --> 36:06.241
like orbiting planets.

36:06.275 --> 36:08.043
I-I don't think so.

36:08.077 --> 36:09.411
What are you afraid of?

36:09.445 --> 36:12.380
I'd just prefer not to be...

36:12.415 --> 36:14.149
Tied to anything.

36:14.183 --> 36:16.384
You may have a point there.

36:16.419 --> 36:21.256
Okay, we'll, uh, make the radius implied.

36:23.225 --> 36:25.026
- Implied?
- Yes.

36:25.061 --> 36:28.671
Implied radius. No cord.

36:28.705 --> 36:33.075
One hour. I'll just set the kitchen timer.

36:33.109 --> 36:35.678
For that hour...

36:35.712 --> 36:38.514
Here is your great mandate

36:38.548 --> 36:41.350
from the mouth of the great Lezley,

36:41.384 --> 36:43.952
who knows not a hell of a lot...

36:43.987 --> 36:46.955
Act as if.

36:46.990 --> 36:49.458
As if what?

36:49.492 --> 36:53.429
As if you belong here, Daniel, with us,

36:53.463 --> 36:57.399
your fellow travelers.

36:57.434 --> 37:00.235
Come on, buddy. You come this far.

37:02.806 --> 37:05.974
I suppose I could have a beer.

37:07.444 --> 37:08.811
Do some yelling.

37:26.596 --> 37:27.963
Stand up.

37:27.997 --> 37:29.398
Stand up.

37:29.432 --> 37:31.266
Wrap this around him.

37:31.301 --> 37:32.634
What?

37:32.669 --> 37:34.603
Just do it, Cindy.

37:34.637 --> 37:36.405
No, I don't think that this is a...

37:36.439 --> 37:39.942
Clearly, the implied
radius was not sufficient.

37:39.976 --> 37:41.410
Crept off when I weren't looking.

37:41.444 --> 37:44.513
Cindy, would you be so kind

37:44.547 --> 37:47.182
- as to get us a refill?
- Get your own, Lezley.

37:47.217 --> 37:49.618
We're kind of in the middle
of something important here.

37:49.652 --> 37:51.453
You're weird.

37:54.858 --> 37:57.259
Buddy, you ain't acting as if.

37:57.293 --> 37:58.861
Uh, yeah.

37:58.895 --> 38:00.662
It's harder than it looks, ain't it?

38:00.697 --> 38:02.364
Exceedingly.

38:02.399 --> 38:04.366
How you ever gonna get where you need to go

38:04.401 --> 38:06.368
sitting off by yourself all the time?

38:06.403 --> 38:08.937
What makes you think I want to go anywhere?

38:08.972 --> 38:10.939
Ain't you done enough of that in your life?

38:10.974 --> 38:13.776
Where did that get you?

38:13.810 --> 38:16.311
Well, unfortunately, here.

38:22.085 --> 38:24.453
You ever read "Siddhartha"?

38:24.487 --> 38:28.157
In my spare time.

38:28.191 --> 38:30.392
He reach enlightenment by
being apart from the world?

38:30.427 --> 38:32.394
Um, no.

38:32.429 --> 38:34.830
That is correct. He did not.

38:34.864 --> 38:37.466
He proffered you got to be in the world.

38:37.500 --> 38:39.034
Got to get dirty.

38:39.068 --> 38:40.903
Rub elbows and shit.

38:40.937 --> 38:44.540
Look, any man reads a newspaper knows

38:44.574 --> 38:48.177
Dan with a "D" Holden's
overdue a little excess,

38:48.211 --> 38:50.179
a little indulgence of the senses.

38:50.213 --> 38:53.148
Some late-night,
low-light

38:53.183 --> 38:55.384
intermingling and intertangling.

38:55.418 --> 38:58.554
I hope you're suggesting girls.

38:58.588 --> 39:00.489
Half of which at this party
want to sleep with you.

39:00.523 --> 39:02.024
The other half are afraid of you,

39:02.058 --> 39:05.160
and half of them still
want to sleep with you.

39:05.195 --> 39:07.563
It ain't even about luck at this point.

39:07.597 --> 39:09.932
And that's how you reach enlightenment?

39:09.966 --> 39:12.334
Who gives a shit? Come on, buddy.

39:12.368 --> 39:14.269
It's time to join the human race,

39:14.304 --> 39:17.072
in all its permutations.

39:26.983 --> 39:29.117
Anchors aweigh, Danny boy.

40:12.013 --> 40:13.981
For later on.

40:14.015 --> 40:15.983
Are they shrooms?

40:16.017 --> 40:18.519
Back to the source.

40:20.088 --> 40:22.456
What's your game, Lezley?

40:22.490 --> 40:24.258
You already know what to do, Daniel.

40:24.292 --> 40:27.661
Just got to remember it.

40:27.696 --> 40:30.664
Take in everything, Dan.

40:30.699 --> 40:33.367
Everything.

40:53.188 --> 40:54.888
Pull.

41:01.396 --> 41:03.030
What's next?

41:04.065 --> 41:06.500
Uh...

41:06.534 --> 41:08.969
Spin Doctors.

41:09.004 --> 41:10.270
Great!

41:10.305 --> 41:11.472
Pull.

41:16.678 --> 41:19.146
Your turn, buddy.

41:19.180 --> 41:20.981
No.

41:21.016 --> 41:23.217
You got to act as if, son.

41:23.251 --> 41:26.653
As if I know how to shoot a gun?

41:26.688 --> 41:29.823
The danger's what makes it fun.

41:32.193 --> 41:34.361
Come on, Dan.

41:34.396 --> 41:36.663
Do the world a favor.

41:36.698 --> 41:39.800
Blow old Michael Bolton off
to bloody hell, won't you?

41:41.236 --> 41:43.303
Daniel!

41:43.338 --> 41:46.407
Daniel! Daniel! Daniel!

41:46.441 --> 41:49.410
Daniel! Daniel! Daniel!

41:49.444 --> 41:52.246
Daniel! Daniel! Daniel!

41:52.280 --> 41:54.148
Daniel! Daniel! Daniel!

41:54.182 --> 41:56.717
Daniel! Daniel! Buddy?

41:56.751 --> 41:58.952
You here?

42:04.459 --> 42:06.160
Yeah.

42:10.065 --> 42:11.799
Pull!
