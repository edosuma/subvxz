WEBVTT

00:01.016 --> 00:03.184
With liberty and justice for all.

00:03.185 --> 00:07.188
I am so grateful to be
living in this fine country.

00:07.189 --> 00:10.909
Me too. Thank God for slavery.

00:11.068 --> 00:13.112
Don't mind me. I'm
high as shit right now.

00:13.113 --> 00:15.363
Drug test Denzel.

00:15.364 --> 00:18.534
Okay, as y'all know,
this year Brickleberry is

00:18.535 --> 00:21.738
proud to host the annual
park service ranger ball.

00:21.739 --> 00:24.973
Well, I, for one, am looking forward to
getting wasted and having anonymous sex

00:24.974 --> 00:28.435
with multiple partners of
various races and genders.

00:28.436 --> 00:30.741
Drug test Ethel.

00:30.742 --> 00:32.222
I Hope I get lucky too.

00:32.223 --> 00:35.074
I'm bringing a friend to be
my date, so fingers crossed.

00:35.075 --> 00:36.475
By friend, he means hooker,

00:36.476 --> 00:38.844
and, by date, he means
shallow grave by the rail road.

00:38.845 --> 00:40.712
I'm glad everyone's gonna have fun.

00:40.713 --> 00:43.877
I'll probably just spend the
whole night by the punch bowl.

00:43.878 --> 00:45.683
By myself.

00:45.684 --> 00:47.396
Alone.

00:47.397 --> 00:49.115
- Again.
- Oh.

00:49.116 --> 00:50.918
That's sweet of you
not to spoil our fun.

00:50.919 --> 00:52.260
I can't wait.

00:52.261 --> 00:54.518
I'll have my pick of the female rangers.

00:54.519 --> 00:57.794
Sometimes I wonder what goes on in
that baby elephant head of yours.

00:57.795 --> 00:59.237
Don't be jealous, Ethel.

00:59.238 --> 01:02.471
Everyone knows I'm the coolest and
best-looking Park Ranger around.

01:02.472 --> 01:04.206
[Wind whistling]

01:04.206 --> 01:05.342
What?

01:05.343 --> 01:07.979
Did someone draw a
dick on my face again?

01:07.980 --> 01:10.500
[Upbeat music]

01:11.817 --> 01:12.834
[Screams]

01:12.835 --> 01:15.235
<i>Brickleberry!</i>

01:17.990 --> 01:19.958
[Overlapping chatter]

01:19.959 --> 01:21.359
She takes out a diaper, right?

01:21.360 --> 01:24.502
And I said, "not yet. I
ain't ready for you yet".

01:24.503 --> 01:26.294
Shh. He's right there.

01:26.295 --> 01:30.134
Hi, guys. Listen, about earlier,
I'd appreciate it if we could just...

01:30.135 --> 01:32.370
Steve, if we teased you about something

01:32.371 --> 01:35.340
so obviously painful, what
kind of friends would we be?

01:35.341 --> 01:38.476
- Thanks, Malloy. I was worried that...
- Trick question.

01:38.477 --> 01:39.842
I'm not friends with bald people.

01:39.843 --> 01:42.423
Hey! [Laughter]

01:47.919 --> 01:49.719
No!

01:49.721 --> 01:51.856
[All snickering]

01:51.857 --> 01:55.688
Go ahead. Laugh it up,
you heartless bastards.

01:55.689 --> 01:57.853
You don't understand
what it's like to be bald.

01:57.854 --> 02:01.864
I've been dealing with this
problem for most of my adult life.

02:01.865 --> 02:06.725
Cruelly, the day I
gained hair in one area...

02:10.750 --> 02:13.870
I lost it in another.

02:14.945 --> 02:19.044
I tried to hide my secret shame, but
sooner or later I would always be exposed.

02:19.045 --> 02:21.205
[Shrieks]

02:22.049 --> 02:23.663
Ow. Ow.

02:23.664 --> 02:25.823
Kids, please, allow me.

02:25.824 --> 02:27.625
Ow. Ow.

02:27.626 --> 02:29.846
[Laughter]

02:29.928 --> 02:31.729
The cruelest blow came on prom night.

02:31.730 --> 02:32.997
[Doorbell rings]

02:32.998 --> 02:37.129
Stacy Blanchard agreed to go with me
if I did her homework for the semester.

02:37.130 --> 02:39.837
Thanks to me, she got to go
to high school an extra year.

02:39.838 --> 02:43.678
You are so getting laid tonight.

02:44.875 --> 02:46.437
I thought we had a deal.

02:46.438 --> 02:52.338
Uh yeah, the contract was void because
I got an "F" and you look like shit.

02:53.389 --> 02:54.552
Allow me.

02:54.553 --> 02:55.553
Ow!

02:55.554 --> 02:57.834
[Hollering]

02:58.090 --> 03:00.430
[Screeching]

03:01.527 --> 03:03.194
Kids can be so cruel.

03:03.195 --> 03:05.096
So can adults, you bald mother[Bleep].

03:05.097 --> 03:06.267
[Squeaking]

03:06.268 --> 03:07.965
Oh, Steve, it's not that bad.

03:07.966 --> 03:09.563
You kind of got that
Michael Chiklis look.

03:09.564 --> 03:10.868
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:10.869 --> 03:13.236
And if he weren't bald and
ugly, that would be a compliment.

03:13.237 --> 03:14.275
[Laughs]

03:14.276 --> 03:15.547
Oh, I got him.

03:15.548 --> 03:17.841
Oh, he thought I was
gonna say something nice.

03:17.842 --> 03:21.512
Must be hard to process sarcasm
with that shitty chrome dome.

03:21.513 --> 03:22.753
[Laughs]

03:22.754 --> 03:26.571
Ethel, I understand Woody,
Denzel, and Malloy teasing Steve,

03:26.572 --> 03:27.870
but you too?

03:27.871 --> 03:29.087
Absolutely.

03:29.088 --> 03:30.754
I've always considered
myself to be someone

03:30.755 --> 03:32.590
who cares more about
animals than people.

03:32.591 --> 03:35.911
- Die, you little bastard.
- [Shouts]

03:35.912 --> 03:39.692
See, this is a perfect example.

03:40.572 --> 03:42.192
There you go, little fella.

03:42.193 --> 03:43.634
You're safe now. [Crunch]

03:43.635 --> 03:44.428
[Kitten meows]

03:44.429 --> 03:46.911
- What was that?
- You just crushed a kitten's head.

03:46.912 --> 03:48.643
Oh, no.

03:48.644 --> 03:49.513
[Gasps]

03:49.514 --> 03:51.614
Oh, no.

03:54.101 --> 03:56.252
I always have you, Viggo Mortensen.

03:56.253 --> 03:58.944
Even if it's only in
my homoerotic dreams.

03:58.945 --> 04:00.551
Hey, Steve, what are you doing?

04:00.552 --> 04:01.819
Uh, nothing.

04:01.820 --> 04:03.488
You're not leaving, are you?

04:03.489 --> 04:05.223
Connie, I spent the last ten years here

04:05.224 --> 04:07.558
cultivating an image of
the coolest guy in the park,

04:07.559 --> 04:10.779
an object of desire for
women and confused animals.

04:10.780 --> 04:12.299
But now that I've been exposed,

04:12.300 --> 04:15.666
I need to find some place
I can be popular again.

04:15.667 --> 04:17.514
That's why I'm headed to...

04:17.515 --> 04:19.136
Ow!

04:19.137 --> 04:21.777
Wounded Knee, South Dakota.

04:21.778 --> 04:23.973
Nah. Too cold.

04:23.974 --> 04:25.348
Ow!

04:25.349 --> 04:27.145
Make that Fishkill, New York?

04:27.146 --> 04:29.813
Steve, I know how it
feels to be unattractive.

04:29.814 --> 04:31.482
It can really hurt.

04:31.483 --> 04:33.751
That's why you need friends
to make you feel better.

04:33.752 --> 04:36.601
Hey, you know that
ranger ball coming up?

04:36.602 --> 04:38.177
We should go together.

04:38.178 --> 04:40.692
You know, as friends.

04:40.693 --> 04:43.161
I'll even get drunk
and give you a tug job.

04:43.162 --> 04:44.913
I'm good, thanks.

04:44.914 --> 04:46.451
Steve, you're a good person.

04:46.452 --> 04:50.268
You just need to make your inside feel as
beautiful as you want your outside to be.

04:50.269 --> 04:54.718
So what you're saying is
make my outside beautiful,

04:54.719 --> 04:57.539
no matter how ugly I am on the inside.

04:57.540 --> 04:59.477
Well, that's not really
what I was saying.

04:59.478 --> 05:01.962
- What I was saying...
- Great advice, Connie.

05:01.963 --> 05:06.218
I'd kiss you if you
weren't so goddamn ugly.

05:06.219 --> 05:08.019
Mm.

05:08.508 --> 05:10.950
Hang in there, little
kitty. Almost to the vet.

05:10.951 --> 05:12.499
Every life is precious.

05:12.500 --> 05:14.152
[Screams]

05:14.153 --> 05:15.838
Thank you, Heavenly Father.

05:15.839 --> 05:19.863
Only by your blessed holy spirit and
amazing Grace did I... [tires screeching]

05:19.864 --> 05:22.633
Ah, Jesus goddamn Christ!

05:22.634 --> 05:23.861
[Cell phone rings]

05:23.862 --> 05:25.570
Denzel's government surplus emporium.

05:25.571 --> 05:28.768
What you need? I got water
coolers, uniforms, rifles.

05:28.769 --> 05:31.497
I even got a waterfall. But you
got to come pick that shit up.

05:31.498 --> 05:32.776
Denzel, it's Ethel.

05:32.777 --> 05:34.985
You're not selling off all
our stuff again, are you?

05:34.986 --> 05:37.415
Hell no. In an unrelated question,

05:37.416 --> 05:39.016
how much do you think I can
get for your black teddy?

05:39.017 --> 05:41.793
Denzel, focus. I just hit a deer.

05:41.794 --> 05:43.222
I think it's gonna die.

05:43.223 --> 05:45.017
You got to put that poor
animal out of its misery.

05:45.018 --> 05:46.093
I can't do that.

05:46.094 --> 05:48.726
It goes against every fiber
of my self-righteous being.

05:48.727 --> 05:51.194
Ethel, it's Malloy. Kill it.

05:51.195 --> 05:52.701
Do you even know what
we're talking about?

05:52.702 --> 05:55.165
Don't know, don't care, just kill it.

05:55.166 --> 05:57.602
If the animal's suffering, trust
me, it's the right thing to do.

05:57.603 --> 05:59.652
Ain't no warranty on that!

05:59.653 --> 06:02.711
I am so sorry, little doe.

06:02.712 --> 06:03.770
[Gunshot]

06:03.771 --> 06:06.411
[Sobbing] Why...

06:07.421 --> 06:10.841
Did I enjoy that so much?

06:13.619 --> 06:18.494
So, Steve, after two years of taking
multiple daily shots in the buttocks,

06:18.495 --> 06:21.525
you can expect to go from
this hairless freak...

06:21.526 --> 06:23.328
To this handsome devil.

06:23.329 --> 06:25.500
What is that, like, four more hairs?

06:25.501 --> 06:27.525
Up to four more hairs.

06:27.526 --> 06:28.728
Growitol.

06:28.729 --> 06:30.418
Ask your doctor if
Growitol's right for you.

06:30.419 --> 06:32.536
You are my doctor. That's why I'm here.

06:32.537 --> 06:35.873
Am I? You know, Steve, I
always saw you more as a friend.

06:35.874 --> 06:38.589
Besides, I was banned from
practicing medicine years ago.

06:38.590 --> 06:40.113
[Chuckles]

06:40.114 --> 06:41.912
I'm not kidding.

06:41.913 --> 06:43.730
Isn't there anything
else you can give me?

06:43.731 --> 06:45.015
Without hair, I'm nobody.

06:45.016 --> 06:47.476
I'm not smart, I'm not
as athletic as I look,

06:47.477 --> 06:50.235
my personality is non-existent,
yet somehow grating.

06:50.236 --> 06:52.404
Well, Steve, there is
the hair tonic that I use.

06:52.405 --> 06:54.533
I purchased it on the
Chinese black market.

06:54.534 --> 06:56.176
Or was it the black Chinese market?

06:56.177 --> 06:58.474
Anyway it's made with tiger sperm.

06:58.475 --> 07:02.182
Now remember, friend, just rub a
thimbleful on your scalp once a week...

07:02.183 --> 07:04.169
Ooh. Not good.

07:04.170 --> 07:06.738
Lucky for you, I'm also
a malpractice attorney.

07:06.739 --> 07:08.899

Man, it's hot all of a sudden.

07:29.470 --> 07:31.074
What happened?

07:31.075 --> 07:34.098
Man, I got a wicked hangover. Oh, God.

07:34.099 --> 07:36.200
What have I done? [Guns cocking]

Say your prayers, grizzly bear.

07:38.203 --> 07:40.963
[Gunfire] [Shouts]

07:44.042 --> 07:46.276
This is for killing my neighbor's pig.

07:46.277 --> 07:48.182
That pig beat me in checkers.

07:48.183 --> 07:49.908
They smarter than dogs, you know.

07:49.909 --> 07:51.415
No, please don't shoot.

07:51.416 --> 07:54.830
He talk. Hold on, Bobby.
That ain't no bear.

07:54.831 --> 07:57.199
That right there is Bigfoot.

07:57.200 --> 07:59.916
Bigfoot. Ha. I'm afraid you're...

07:59.917 --> 08:03.594
Holy shit, we're in the
presence of greatness.

08:03.595 --> 08:04.829
Hey, everybody!

08:04.830 --> 08:08.098
It's Bigfoot, a real-life celebrity.

08:08.099 --> 08:09.233
[Excited chatter]

08:09.234 --> 08:11.535
Your hair is beautiful. It's so silky.

08:11.536 --> 08:12.704
Can we get a picture with you?

08:12.705 --> 08:15.290
Listen, people, I'm flattered
by the attention, but...

08:15.291 --> 08:18.576
Bigfoot, will you sign
my gigantic breasts?

08:18.577 --> 08:20.272
Bigfoot would love to.

08:20.273 --> 08:22.643
I know just where I'm gonna put the os.

08:22.644 --> 08:25.044
The nipples.

08:31.554 --> 08:33.489
Hey, has anyone seen my stapler?

08:33.490 --> 08:35.058
It's probably on your desk.

08:35.058 --> 08:37.078
- Thanks.
- Where's my desk?

08:37.078 --> 08:40.062
Where it always is. By the copy machine.

08:40.063 --> 08:42.712
Where's the goddamn copy machine?

08:42.712 --> 08:45.937
It's right there. Denzel,
you see it, don't you?

08:45.938 --> 08:47.079
Of course I do.

08:47.080 --> 08:48.858
Chh-chh. Beep.

08:48.859 --> 08:51.596
[Imitating machine whirring]

08:51.597 --> 08:52.741
This isn't good.

another one of your episodes.

[Fly buzzing]

08:59.599 --> 09:01.985
- Did you just kill a fly?
- Huh. I guess I did.

09:01.986 --> 09:05.698
- That's not like you at all, Ethel.
- Ah, it's no big deal. It's just a fly.

09:05.699 --> 09:09.394
My old "savior to the animals"
stance may have been a little extreme.

09:09.395 --> 09:10.916
Well, I'm glad to hear
you've come to your senses.

09:10.917 --> 09:12.011
Thank you.

09:12.012 --> 09:14.334
Oh, look at you. You're still alive.

09:21.348 --> 09:24.408
[Cheering and chatter]

09:26.155 --> 09:30.858
Okay, I only have time for several
hundred more final questions, everybody.

09:30.859 --> 09:33.610
Hello, Bigfoot, Timmy from
Timmy's YouTube channel.

09:33.611 --> 09:36.680
Why now, after centuries of hiding,
have you chosen to go public?

09:36.681 --> 09:39.283
Because, Timmy, I wanted to be famous.

09:39.284 --> 09:42.327
And famous people get a shitload of ass.

09:42.328 --> 09:44.755
All: Yay, Bigfoot!

09:44.756 --> 09:46.856
[Cheers]

09:48.783 --> 09:50.403
- Is it?
- Could it be?

09:50.404 --> 09:51.725
You damn right it is.

09:51.726 --> 09:54.482
Yo, Chewbacca, you got to give me
a ride in the Millennium Falcon.

09:54.483 --> 09:57.779
No, it's Bigfoot, the mythical
creature that's responsible for

09:57.780 --> 10:00.881
countless hours of shitty
programming on the Discovery Channel.

10:00.882 --> 10:04.046
- Connie, look who's here.
- Yeah, nice to meet you, Bigfoot.

10:04.047 --> 10:07.671
Guys, I'm worried about Steve.
He's been missing since yesterday.

10:07.672 --> 10:09.228
Ah, screw Steve.

10:09.229 --> 10:11.599
Bigfoot's a bona fide
tourist attraction.

10:11.600 --> 10:14.771
But Steve's our friend. I
think he could be in danger.

10:14.772 --> 10:17.605
That's very sweet of you,
stranger who I've never met,

10:17.606 --> 10:22.109
but let's not draw attention away from
me, Bigfoot, because that's who I am.

10:22.110 --> 10:26.443
Mr. Foot, please feel
welcome here at Brickleberry.

10:26.444 --> 10:29.284
As long as you don't go all
chimpy and rip our faces off.

10:29.285 --> 10:31.505
[Chuckles]

10:31.653 --> 10:33.335
I think I just gave him an idea.

10:33.336 --> 10:36.169
Fear not, humanoids.
Bigfoot's your friend.

10:36.170 --> 10:38.580
Unlike that Jew-hating
Loch Ness Monster.

10:38.581 --> 10:40.795
I hate the Jews!

10:40.796 --> 10:42.597
All I desire is your adulation.

10:42.598 --> 10:44.366
Somebody give me some rubber gloves.

10:44.367 --> 10:49.556
If I'm gonna adulate this guy, I don't
want to get that gunk all over my hands.

10:49.557 --> 10:50.649
Hey, Steve.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.990
I'm not Steve, my
fellow woodland creature.

10:53.991 --> 10:56.348
I'm the notorious B-i-g...

10:56.349 --> 10:58.809
F-o-o-t...

10:59.275 --> 11:00.015
E.

11:00.016 --> 11:03.284
Hair or no hair, you smell
like a Turkish man's balls.

11:03.285 --> 11:05.654
Please, Malloy, don't blow this for me.

11:05.655 --> 11:09.202
No one gives a damn about Steve.
This is a chance to reinvent myself.

11:09.203 --> 11:12.522
Take it easy, Polamalu. I'm
not gonna blow your cover.

11:12.523 --> 11:15.387
There's money to be made
here. And I'll be your manager.

11:15.388 --> 11:17.213
Okay. 5% sound fair?

11:17.214 --> 11:20.503
- Sure. I'll give you 5%.
- Deal. Wow, you're shrewd.

11:20.504 --> 11:24.224
I'm lucky you're on my side.

11:26.000 --> 11:32.074

11:45.026 --> 11:48.026
[Cheers and applause]

11:48.664 --> 11:50.824
[Screams]

11:56.472 --> 11:58.812
[Whimpering]

12:01.944 --> 12:03.953
Oh, you poor baby.

12:03.954 --> 12:06.652
Ethel will make it
all better. [Cocks gun]

12:06.653 --> 12:08.625
Whoa! What the hell are you doing?

12:08.626 --> 12:12.688
I have to do it Denzel, this cute
little guy was abandoned by his mother.

12:12.689 --> 12:14.283
He wasn't abandoned by his mother.

12:14.284 --> 12:17.257
His mother's right there.

12:17.258 --> 12:20.484
- Oh, my God. You shot it!
- Well, I had no choice, Denzel.

12:20.485 --> 12:23.563
It was distraught its
baby was about to die.

12:23.564 --> 12:26.284
All right, Ethel, what the
hell is going on with you?

12:26.285 --> 12:27.335
[Sighs]

12:27.336 --> 12:29.214
All right, here's the thing.

12:29.215 --> 12:34.466
When I killed that deer, I
had the best orgasm of my life.

12:34.467 --> 12:37.196
I've been chasing
that dragon ever since.

12:37.197 --> 12:40.881
Ethel, you're confused. Women
don't have no orgasms. Pfft.

12:40.882 --> 12:43.485
- And you got to stop this killing, girl.
- I guess you're right, Denzel.

12:43.486 --> 12:44.952
I promise, no more killing.

12:44.953 --> 12:45.953
[Frog croaks]

12:45.954 --> 12:46.988
[Squish]

12:46.989 --> 12:49.449
Starting now.

12:52.094 --> 12:53.532
Sasquatch!

12:53.533 --> 12:56.174
I got your face tattooed on my anus!

12:56.175 --> 12:58.566
Much love. Wish I could stop.

12:58.567 --> 13:00.250
Let's talk big picture here.

13:00.251 --> 13:02.003
How long we gonna milk this
Wookiee in the woods routine?

13:02.004 --> 13:04.038
What are you talking
about? Steve is dead.

13:04.039 --> 13:06.374
I'm gonna be Bigfoot forever.

13:06.375 --> 13:08.510
Hey, Bigfoot, if it
wouldn't be too much trouble,

13:08.511 --> 13:11.327
could you make love to
my wife while I watch?

13:11.328 --> 13:12.704
Inappropriate.

13:12.705 --> 13:14.636
[Screams]

13:14.637 --> 13:17.418
- I'm blind!
- Trust me. I did you a favor.

13:17.419 --> 13:19.287
So, Steve, big gig on Wednesday.

13:19.288 --> 13:21.722
You're gonna be emceeing
a dwarf fashion show.

13:21.723 --> 13:24.399
No can do, baby. I'm
going to the ranger ball.

13:24.400 --> 13:26.350
But I already booked Giselle Munchkin.

13:26.351 --> 13:28.489
Sorry, Malloy, the
ball is tomorrow night,

13:28.490 --> 13:30.798
and I know just who I'm going to take.

13:30.799 --> 13:32.300
Oh, God!

13:32.301 --> 13:34.924
Oops, sorry. Wrong picture.

13:34.925 --> 13:37.504
The most beautiful woman in the world.

13:37.505 --> 13:40.491
I cannot believe you are gonna
make me kill all those Dwarves.

13:40.492 --> 13:42.720
Who said anything about killing Dwarves?

13:42.721 --> 13:44.519
It's either that or I pay them.

13:44.520 --> 13:46.362
And I'm not planning on paying them.

13:46.363 --> 13:50.171
So that means I'm going
to have to kill them.

13:50.172 --> 13:51.783
Steve!

13:51.784 --> 13:54.064
Oh, Steve!

13:55.976 --> 13:58.076
Oh, no.

13:59.036 --> 14:00.807
This is terrible.

14:00.808 --> 14:06.708
Hey, have you seen the little bear?
He told us to meet him right here.

14:14.633 --> 14:16.500
You look beautiful, my love.

14:16.501 --> 14:18.133
Hey, no kiss on mouth.

14:18.134 --> 14:20.691
Baby hatch okay, but not on mouth.

14:20.692 --> 14:23.938
Oh, you are one classy lady.

14:23.939 --> 14:27.011
Stacy should be here any
minute. I'm so excited.

14:27.012 --> 14:29.647
Why are you so obsessed with
this girl from high school?

14:29.648 --> 14:32.583
You should be dating a celebrity.
It's good for the brand.

14:32.584 --> 14:33.818
Like Audrey Hepburn?

14:33.819 --> 14:36.254
Yeah, but alive and
not as much of a whore.

14:36.255 --> 14:40.091
That must be her. The most
beautiful girl on earth.

14:40.092 --> 14:42.459
She hasn't changed a bit.

14:42.460 --> 14:44.228
Madame, shall we?

14:44.229 --> 14:46.964
[Electronic voice] Bigfoot,
you are so handsome.

14:46.965 --> 14:49.400
Oh, my God. That's awesome.

14:49.401 --> 14:51.312
You sound just like Megatron.

14:51.313 --> 14:55.226
Oh, Bigfoot, I feel like I
could start a new life with you.

14:55.227 --> 14:59.967
Here are the keys.
Drive 'em into the lake.

15:00.262 --> 15:03.414
Yo, yo, biggity foot inside the house.

15:03.415 --> 15:04.703
What's the deal?

15:04.704 --> 15:06.417
I thought this was
supposed to be a party.

15:06.418 --> 15:09.253
Yeah, but it turned
into a memorial service.

15:09.254 --> 15:11.422
We just got some bad news, Bigfoot.

15:11.423 --> 15:14.353
Connie found Steve's
car smashed in a ravine.

15:14.354 --> 15:16.127
He must have lost control.

15:16.128 --> 15:19.226
His tires were as bald
as his head. [Sobbing]

15:19.227 --> 15:21.227
Oh. All right.

15:21.228 --> 15:23.670
Let's have a moment of silence.

15:23.671 --> 15:26.137
Okay, let's tear this shit up!

15:26.138 --> 15:29.254
No. Tonight we honor our friend.

15:29.255 --> 15:32.725
And shame on all of you for teasing
him for something he couldn't help.

15:32.726 --> 15:36.656
- I feel terrible.
- Yeah, me too.

15:36.657 --> 15:38.000
Me too.

15:38.001 --> 15:41.564
I never met this Steve fellow,
but he sounds like a great guy.

15:41.565 --> 15:45.493
Hold on. You had every right
to treat Steve like an asshole.

15:45.494 --> 15:46.724
He was bald.

15:46.725 --> 15:48.625
But you know who has lots of hair?

15:48.626 --> 15:50.928
Bigfoot. Come on, everyone!

15:50.929 --> 15:54.031
Do the Bigfoot. It goes a
little something like this.

15:54.032 --> 15:56.552
[Upbeat music]

15:59.938 --> 16:02.273
Stop Bigfoot dancing.

16:02.274 --> 16:04.608
Why don't you want us
to remember our friend?

16:04.609 --> 16:06.577
I'll tell you why.

16:06.578 --> 16:10.381
The police lab just analyzed Steve's
clothes, and they were covered in hair...

16:10.382 --> 16:14.342
Hair genetically identical to this!

16:15.319 --> 16:17.755
Okay, guys, there's an
explanation for this.

16:17.756 --> 16:19.573
Yeah. There is.

16:19.574 --> 16:21.567
You killed Steve.

16:21.568 --> 16:24.128
- He's a murderer!
- He's a monster!

16:24.129 --> 16:25.296
Look who's talking.

16:25.297 --> 16:27.517
[Shouting]

16:27.632 --> 16:31.269
No, it's a misunderstanding.
Tell 'em, Malloy.

16:31.270 --> 16:34.205
I have no idea what this
Bigfoot is talking about.

16:34.206 --> 16:37.608
Sorry, buddy, but your death is gonna
make for a merchandising bonanza.

16:37.609 --> 16:40.075
- Let's get him.
- We're gonna bring you to justice.

16:40.076 --> 16:42.846
To hell with justice.
I am gonna kill you.

16:42.847 --> 16:46.687
And I am really gonna enjoy it.

16:47.127 --> 16:49.934
Uh-oh. Somebody call FEMA.

16:49.935 --> 16:52.430
It feels like a levee
just broke in my pants.

16:52.431 --> 16:54.951
[All shouting]

16:55.060 --> 16:56.265
[Panting]

16:56.266 --> 16:59.496
Who the hell brings torches
and pitchforks to a ball?

16:59.497 --> 17:02.666
[Dogs barking, crowd shouting]

17:02.667 --> 17:04.902
We gonna get you, Bigfoot!

17:04.903 --> 17:08.164
I'm not Bigfoot. Let me explain.

17:08.165 --> 17:09.224
[Gunshot]

17:09.226 --> 17:11.141
Oh, sorry about that, BoDean.

17:11.142 --> 17:13.061
What?

17:13.744 --> 17:16.409
There you go, buddy. Good as new.

17:16.410 --> 17:18.329
What?

17:18.597 --> 17:21.117
[Both panting]

17:21.286 --> 17:22.752
Damn, this Bigfoot fast.

17:22.753 --> 17:24.288
I want justice.

17:24.289 --> 17:26.557
I make my own goddamn justice.

17:26.558 --> 17:30.318
It's looting time up in this bitch!

17:30.319 --> 17:33.439
Shit, this is my car.

17:35.517 --> 17:38.736
Die, you big-footed freak. Die!

17:38.737 --> 17:40.897
[Gunshot]

17:41.645 --> 17:43.933
Give me that. I'm a natural predator.

17:43.934 --> 17:47.245
No! No. I have to do it.

17:47.246 --> 17:49.908
You try that again, and I will
blow your frickin' head off.

17:49.909 --> 17:54.829
That's weird. Usually
I can smell your period.

17:55.713 --> 17:58.833
[Gunshots and shouting]

18:03.337 --> 18:05.243
Show yourself, killer.

18:05.244 --> 18:08.004
[Echoing "killer"]

18:08.029 --> 18:11.989
I like boobies. [Echoing "boobies"]

18:23.982 --> 18:25.527
Aw, man.

18:25.528 --> 18:30.288
Prepare to meet Bigfoot Jesus,
you hairy son of a bitch.

18:30.289 --> 18:33.461
Damn it, BoDean, don't stand in front
of me when I'm shooting something.

18:33.462 --> 18:35.364
- What?
- I ain't got anymore gum.

18:35.365 --> 18:37.371
That's okay, Bobby.

18:37.372 --> 18:38.827
Wow, good solution.

18:38.828 --> 18:40.786
Now prepare to die.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.256
I'm not prepared.

18:42.257 --> 18:44.417
[Roaring]

18:45.513 --> 18:47.328
Bigfoot?

18:47.329 --> 18:48.684
So you are real.

18:48.685 --> 18:51.192
[Grunts and whimpers]

18:51.193 --> 18:53.327
Thank you for saving my life.

18:53.328 --> 18:58.091
I don't blame you for hiding from
society all these years, mythical giant.

18:58.092 --> 19:00.788
You are not the savage. We are.

19:00.789 --> 19:05.573
We humans are vulgar, violent,
and, above all, never to be trusted.

19:05.574 --> 19:06.608
[Guns cock]

19:06.609 --> 19:08.449
Shoot him. He killed Steve.

19:08.450 --> 19:09.694
Hmm?

19:09.695 --> 19:11.855
[Gunshot]

19:14.984 --> 19:17.024
[Moans]

19:18.053 --> 19:20.273
Oh, yeah.

19:20.878 --> 19:25.438
Ah, that was uncomfortable
for all of us.

19:25.996 --> 19:28.696
I can't believe I
killed the real Bigfoot.

19:28.697 --> 19:32.133
He was completely innocent,
as are all animals.

19:32.134 --> 19:34.903
How will I ever forgive myself?

19:34.904 --> 19:36.152
You probably won't.

19:36.153 --> 19:38.673
I mean, not with this
as a constant reminder.

19:38.674 --> 19:41.378
You can almost tell that his
last words were "you bitch".

19:41.379 --> 19:43.208
[Weeps]

19:43.209 --> 19:44.260
Hey, everybody.

19:44.261 --> 19:47.406
I just want you to know I feel
terrible about pretending to be Bigfoot.

19:47.407 --> 19:48.489
Yeah, you should.

19:48.490 --> 19:51.168
And when are you gonna get rid
of that stupid asshole hair,

19:51.169 --> 19:52.954
you stupid, hairy asshole?

19:52.955 --> 19:56.237
I've tried everything. I guess
the drug's just got to wear off.

19:56.238 --> 19:58.926
- Nice to have you back, Steve.
- Thanks, Connie.

19:58.927 --> 20:01.395
The one thing I've realized
throughout this whole ordeal

20:01.396 --> 20:03.531
is what a great friend you are to me.

20:03.532 --> 20:05.466
Oh, come on.

20:05.467 --> 20:07.959
No, you are really an amazing person.

20:07.960 --> 20:12.565
I should have just saved myself a lot
of trouble and taken you to the dance.

20:12.566 --> 20:16.144
- Shall we?
- I'd be honored.

20:16.145 --> 20:19.080
Nothing could ruin this special moment.

20:19.081 --> 20:20.461
Except that.

20:20.462 --> 20:24.155
Yes, Steve's back in all his glory.

20:24.156 --> 20:26.331
Damn, Steve, cover your ass up.

20:26.332 --> 20:29.849
No. I'll never feel shame again.

20:29.850 --> 20:35.750
I am a bald, overweight man with
misshapen genitals, and proud of it!

20:35.990 --> 20:39.110
Soak it in, everybody.

20:47.242 --> 20:49.402
