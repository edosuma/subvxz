43:17.689 --> 43:18.827
- Nobody said get out.

43:21.379 --> 43:23.655
- Yeah, not much point in that.

43:30.517 --> 43:31.689
- I have children.

43:31.758 --> 43:33.724
- So do I.

43:33.793 --> 43:35.724
And from what I've seen, yours
will be better off without you.

43:42.379 --> 43:43.448
Where are you from?

43:47.965 --> 43:48.862
- California.

43:52.620 --> 43:54.000
- Figures...

44:07.517 --> 44:10.551
I'm gonna leave these
holes just like this.

44:12.103 --> 44:13.931
Right here in
the middle of my field.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.862
And if you ever come back again,
I'm gonna fill em.

44:16.931 --> 44:17.965
You understand?

44:21.000 --> 44:21.965
- Thank you.

44:22.034 --> 44:24.034
- "Thank you"'s not an answer.

44:24.103 --> 44:27.137
Repeat what I say:

44:27.206 --> 44:28.620
I'm going back to California.

44:28.689 --> 44:30.241
- I'm going back to California.

44:30.310 --> 44:31.965
- Montana doesn't want you.

44:32.034 --> 44:34.206
- Montana doesn't want me.

44:34.275 --> 44:36.655
I'm never coming back.
I swear.

44:38.379 --> 44:39.586
- I'm gonna hold you to that.

44:59.551 --> 45:02.275
- Don't think we'll
be seeing them again.

45:02.344 --> 45:03.448
- Nope.

45:04.896 --> 45:07.517
- Want us to fill these holes?

45:09.448 --> 45:11.034
- They want to put
an airport here.

45:13.206 --> 45:15.724
- Yeah, I know.

45:15.793 --> 45:17.586
What do you want
to do about it?

45:17.655 --> 45:19.241
- I'm not sure yet.

45:23.724 --> 45:25.103
Don't fill the holes.

45:25.172 --> 45:26.448
- No?
- No.

45:26.517 --> 45:27.862
- Rip?
- Sir.

45:29.724 --> 45:32.206
- Have the boys take
down my tent at camp.

45:32.275 --> 45:34.137
I'm moving back to the lodge.

45:34.206 --> 45:35.344
- You sure you want
me to do that?

45:35.413 --> 45:37.000
You might want to
go up there some.

45:37.068 --> 45:38.310
- I'm sure.

45:40.379 --> 45:42.068
My summer's over.
