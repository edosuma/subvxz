Woman's voice: Josh.

00:35.345 --> 00:36.559
(Moaning on computer)

00:36.579 --> 00:38.693
- Josh, come on.
- Yeah, I know.

00:39.053 --> 00:40.430
We need to talk.

00:40.450 --> 00:42.952
Of course, what...
What? What's up?

00:43.019 --> 00:45.486
- I don't want to do this anymore.
- What...

00:45.506 --> 00:47.002
What? What-what do you mean?

00:47.022 --> 00:48.959
This just isn't working for me.

00:49.027 --> 00:50.664
It's the same thing every time.

00:50.732 --> 00:52.802
The laptop,
the lubriderm. I'm bored.

00:52.870 --> 00:53.870
Aren't you bored?

00:53.938 --> 00:54.971
No, I'm not bored.

00:55.039 --> 00:56.073
This is fun. I think-I think...

00:56.141 --> 00:57.575
I like what we have.

00:57.643 --> 00:59.612
- I think it's fun.
- Remember eighth grade?

00:59.682 --> 01:02.419
Back then, things were so
passionate, they were exciting.

01:02.487 --> 01:05.441
God, I'll never forget the day
we found that Delia's catalogue.

01:05.461 --> 01:07.228
Or-or that time
on the bus on the

01:07.296 --> 01:10.436
- Washington, D.C. trip.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, D.C. was crazy.

01:10.504 --> 01:12.405
But lately,
it's gotten so mechanical.

01:12.473 --> 01:14.475
I want more than this.

01:14.543 --> 01:17.246
I want to play guitar.
I want to work a loom.

01:17.266 --> 01:18.417
Learn sign language.

01:18.437 --> 01:19.947
And you'll do
all those things, but can we just

01:20.015 --> 01:22.585
pick this up in, like, three
and a half to four minutes time?

01:22.653 --> 01:24.386
Okay, see, this
is what I'm talking about.

01:24.454 --> 01:26.288
It's like we're just going
through the motions.

01:26.355 --> 01:28.291
I'm sick of it. I-I want
to see what's out there.

01:28.359 --> 01:31.197
I mean, I've only
been with one other guy.

01:32.432 --> 01:34.298
What? When?

01:34.366 --> 01:37.100
- At camp. You were asleep.
- Was it that

01:37.168 --> 01:41.420
- creepy kid with the dead eye, Tobias?
- It wasn't Tobias.

01:41.440 --> 01:43.041
Then who was it?

01:44.510 --> 01:46.747
The point is I just,
I can't take this anymore.

01:46.815 --> 01:48.615
I'm sorry, Josh. I'm leaving.

01:48.683 --> 01:50.685
Whoa. Oh, my...

01:50.753 --> 01:53.390
Oh... wait, okay. D-don't
go. Please, we can...

01:53.457 --> 01:55.460
We can try new things,
we can spice it up.

01:55.528 --> 01:57.394
Different-different web sites.

01:57.462 --> 01:59.885
I... different grips.

02:00.096 --> 02:01.934
Good-bye, Josh.

02:02.001 --> 02:03.871
Good-bye, hand.

(Phone buzzing)
Who is texting you so late?

02:48.812 --> 02:51.231
Oh, Mike. Wow. Let's see.

02:51.251 --> 02:55.432
"Better get hard, son. I'm
getting you laid tonight."

02:55.452 --> 02:57.557
- Huh.
- Ew.

02:57.624 --> 02:59.258
Yeah, ew.

02:59.326 --> 03:01.992
You don't need that guy to help you
get a girlfriend. You know that, right?

03:02.012 --> 03:02.680
Mm.

03:02.700 --> 03:04.929
Like, you're gonna find
someone super wonderful,

Thank you. Thank you, Liz.
I appreciate that.

03:08.882 --> 03:12.170
You know, and in the meantime,
you can just... focus on you.

03:12.238 --> 03:14.573
- Mm-hmm.
- The path to love...

03:14.641 --> 03:16.175
self-love.

03:16.243 --> 03:17.976
- Oh. Uh, yeah.
- You know?

03:18.043 --> 03:19.943
Just maybe taking a yoga class.

03:20.011 --> 03:23.013
- Eh...
- Or just go over to the gym.

03:23.081 --> 03:24.815
- Yeah, I guess I could.
- Meditate.

03:24.883 --> 03:26.716
- Meditate five minutes a day.
- Just... yeah, okay.

03:26.783 --> 03:30.252
- Yup.
- These are just tiny little seeds

03:30.320 --> 03:32.056

planting here, and it's

03:32.123 --> 03:34.124

03:34.192 --> 03:36.758
Maybe not gonna take a
week. A couple months.

That's you.

Beautiful woman's gonna walk by.

03:43.586 --> 03:45.318
She's gonna be like...

03:45.338 --> 03:46.604
"I want that.

03:46.671 --> 03:48.205
"I want this...

03:48.273 --> 03:50.005
in my face."

03:50.073 --> 03:52.472
- Huh.
- And you're gonna be like,

03:52.540 --> 03:55.541
(buzzing) "Damn. So
glad I watered myself."

03:55.608 --> 03:58.508
Whoa, whoa... why don't you
go running with me tomorrow?

03:58.576 --> 03:59.940
- You could be my running partner.
- Yeah, um...

04:00.008 --> 04:01.274

04:07.977 --> 04:10.178
- Too early?
- No, 7:00 a.m.'s not early enough.

04:10.245 --> 04:13.612
But, uh, in that case,
I should hit the sack...

04:13.680 --> 04:14.882
- Yeah, totally...
- of hay.

04:14.949 --> 04:17.052
New and improved Josh.
Bright and early.

04:17.120 --> 04:18.887
- Right, no, that's perfect... 7:00 a.m.
- See you tomorrow morning.

04:18.954 --> 04:21.122
- See you tomorrow morning.
- I'm excited. For you.

04:21.190 --> 04:23.158
- Oh, good. All right, cool.

04:23.225 --> 04:24.924

Uh, so what are-what are
their names?

04:31.400 --> 04:33.500
- Whose names?
- The, uh...

04:33.568 --> 04:36.003
- slobbering girls.
- Oh, no, I didn't mean specific girls,

04:36.071 --> 04:37.505
I just meant
whoever's at the bar.

04:37.572 --> 04:39.472
Oh, you don't act... oh.

04:39.540 --> 04:41.407
- Oh.
- Come on, let's go.

04:41.474 --> 04:43.940
Yeah, I-I don't know, man.
Bars aren't really my thing.

04:44.008 --> 04:47.910
Josh, the only way you're gonna
69 with some flat-chested skanks

04:47.978 --> 04:49.578
is if you go to the bar
and talk to them.

04:49.645 --> 04:51.078
Yeah, I know.

04:51.146 --> 04:53.649
- You're not scared, are you?
- I... no.

04:53.717 --> 04:55.644
You know how much I love...

04:56.214 --> 04:58.006
- wooing women.

09:38.824 --> 09:41.160
(All laughing) (Mike whoops)

09:43.564 --> 09:46.433
(Laughs) Two shots, please.

09:46.501 --> 09:48.837
Dude, this place is sick.

09:48.904 --> 09:50.674
There's this girl, Sara...
she is all over me.

09:50.742 --> 09:52.110
Are you...

09:52.178 --> 09:54.947
How-how is it so easy for you
to talk to these girls?

09:55.015 --> 09:56.884
- Like, what's your secret?
- Dude, there's no secret.

09:56.952 --> 09:59.287
All you got to do is find
a girl, walk up to her,

09:59.355 --> 10:02.025
say "hi," do spiral eyes,
ask her her name,

10:02.093 --> 10:03.561
- maybe buy her a drink, and then...
- Wait, wait, wait. Go back.

10:03.628 --> 10:04.996
What-what did you just say?

10:05.064 --> 10:06.532
- Buy her a drink.
- No, before that.

10:06.599 --> 10:08.467
- Say "hi"?
- No, the other...

10:08.536 --> 10:10.736
Uh, spiral something.
Something with spiral?

10:10.804 --> 10:13.404
Spiral eyes. You know, it's
how you get girls to like you.

10:13.472 --> 10:14.607
One second.

10:14.674 --> 10:16.409
What's up, girl?

10:19.745 --> 10:21.978
- What's up?
- See you on the dance floor.

10:22.046 --> 10:23.813
Can't wait.

10:23.881 --> 10:25.181
See?

10:25.249 --> 10:27.084
I-I've never seen that
before in my life.

10:27.151 --> 10:28.784
Your-your eyes turn
into these spinning...

10:28.852 --> 10:31.222
Spinning hypnotic spirals.
Right. Spiral eyes.

10:31.290 --> 10:32.794
Well, how did you learn
to do that?

10:32.861 --> 10:34.429
Well, the same way
everybody learns.

10:34.496 --> 10:36.664
The day I hit puberty, a
wizard appeared and taught me.

10:36.732 --> 10:38.132
Did that not happen to you?

10:38.200 --> 10:40.035
- No.
- Are you sure?

10:40.103 --> 10:42.871
A tall guy, pointy hat,
he had a long white beard?

10:42.939 --> 10:44.337
I know what a wizard looks like.

10:44.405 --> 10:45.872
I'm saying I've never met one.

10:45.940 --> 10:47.609
Hold on. Wait a minute. Stop.

10:47.677 --> 10:49.845
If you can't do spiral eyes,
how do you hit on girls?

10:49.912 --> 10:52.780
I-I don't know. I just walk up
to them and say random stuff.

10:52.848 --> 10:54.783
- About what?
- The room we're in.

10:54.851 --> 10:57.088
Or, uh, current events.

10:57.156 --> 10:58.757
Like if there's something
going on in the news.

10:58.825 --> 11:01.159
Or if there's a song playing,
I'll reference the song.

11:01.227 --> 11:03.242
Stuff like that.

11:03.262 --> 11:05.463
So, you can't do spiral eyes?

11:05.530 --> 11:07.864
- No.
- That's unbelievable, man!

11:07.932 --> 11:09.466
I got to see what
it's like to be you.

11:09.533 --> 11:11.200
- Yeah?
- Just two seconds, yeah.

11:11.268 --> 11:13.770
- (Clears his throat) Cool bar, right?
- What?

11:13.838 --> 11:17.239
Uh, it's pretty crazy what's
happening in the news, huh?

11:17.306 --> 11:18.608
I've got to go.

11:18.676 --> 11:20.108
Of course you do.

11:20.176 --> 11:21.740
(Laughing): Who could blame you?

11:21.808 --> 11:23.606
- That's your life?
- Yeah.

11:23.674 --> 11:26.675
That was, like, oh, my
asshole and my throat touched

11:26.742 --> 11:28.712
in the center of my body.

11:28.779 --> 11:31.109
No wonder you were scared to
come in here, man. Ooh.

11:31.129 --> 11:31.763
Yeah.

11:31.783 --> 11:33.484
- I'm really sorry, but...
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Just...

11:33.552 --> 11:35.620
teach me how to do,
uh, spiral eyes.

11:35.687 --> 11:37.021
Dude, I'm no wizard.

11:37.089 --> 11:39.991
I'm just an ordinary guy.

11:41.535 --> 11:43.325
Who wants some of this?

11:43.345 --> 11:46.746
Yeah, touch it. Touch it.
Touch it, yeah.

11:47.698 --> 11:50.865
My life is amazing!

11:50.933 --> 11:52.334
(Mike laughs)

11:52.401 --> 11:54.937
No condoms tonight. Mm, mm.

11:59.575 --> 12:03.143
(Sputters, sighs)

12:04.182 --> 12:05.816
(Toilet flushing)

12:05.883 --> 12:07.854
(Imitates gunshot)

12:07.874 --> 12:10.788
(Zippering)

12:10.856 --> 12:13.091
(Man humming)

12:14.494 --> 12:16.095
(Lever clicking)

12:16.163 --> 12:17.899
(Man laughs)

12:17.967 --> 12:19.881
Having a good night.

12:20.998 --> 12:24.337
It's like a vagina party
out there.

12:24.357 --> 12:26.123
Supply and demand,

12:26.143 --> 12:29.544
but there's too much demand
sometimes,

12:29.611 --> 12:32.484
and, you know,
not enough of these, I guess.

12:32.894 --> 12:34.259
Oh. (Laughs)

12:34.279 --> 12:35.363
He had a good night. Ooh.

12:35.364 --> 12:36.555
It smells like curry.

12:36.623 --> 12:37.857
One size fits all.

12:37.924 --> 12:39.770
Hopefully, it'll fit.

12:40.461 --> 12:42.314
Oh.

12:43.294 --> 12:44.699
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

12:44.767 --> 12:45.901
Dude, where you going, man?

12:45.969 --> 12:47.704
I'm going home. Come on.

12:47.772 --> 12:49.206
You can't quit, Josh.

12:49.274 --> 12:50.673
There's still plenty
of girls left.

12:50.741 --> 12:52.042
That's not gonna happen, man.

12:52.110 --> 12:53.678
I'm-I'm tired, and I'm broke,

12:53.746 --> 12:56.270
and it's very late.
I'm-I'm done.

12:56.418 --> 12:58.984
- Let me buy you drink.
- I don't want another drink, man!

12:59.052 --> 13:00.284
Whoa.

13:01.250 --> 13:03.650
You, do a shot with me.

13:03.670 --> 13:06.413
- Yeah. Go.
- Yeah, okay. Yeah, okay.

13:07.232 --> 13:08.526
(Sighs)

13:08.919 --> 13:09.927
Yeah.

13:09.994 --> 13:11.764
(Laughs)

13:11.831 --> 13:13.433
Okay. Hey.

13:13.501 --> 13:15.869
(Woman laughs) Attaboy!

13:16.676 --> 13:19.232
Get it in
where you fit it in, dawg.

13:36.524 --> 13:38.766
- Come on.
- No, no, no.

13:49.936 --> 13:52.084
(Sniffing)

13:53.015 --> 13:54.323
(Mumbles) All right, okay.

13:54.390 --> 13:56.424
(Sniffing)

13:57.011 --> 13:58.628
(Groaning)

13:58.695 --> 14:01.866
(Slow-motion growling)

14:08.241 --> 14:10.476
All right... ooh.

14:10.544 --> 14:13.016
Ooh. Oh, gosh. Okay.

14:13.084 --> 14:14.651
- Okay. Get down.
- Oh, okay.

14:14.719 --> 14:16.286
(Groans)

14:16.354 --> 14:17.422
Now it's like Basic Instinct.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.259
- Take it off.
- Okay. Yeah.

14:19.327 --> 14:21.096
- All right.
- Now, just take it...

14:21.164 --> 14:22.631
Yeah. (Both moaning)

14:22.699 --> 14:25.067
(Moaning and groaning) Okay.

14:25.135 --> 14:27.268
- (Panting) Oh, give it to me.
- Okay. Here we go.

14:27.336 --> 14:29.271
- God.
- Just keep it going.

14:29.339 --> 14:30.873
- Just take it off.
- I'll take off my shirt,

14:30.941 --> 14:32.164
and you take off yours. Okay.

14:32.184 --> 14:34.607
- Okay. I want it. There we go.
- Josh, Josh, Josh.

14:34.675 --> 14:36.681
- Shh.
- Okay. Aah. Go.

14:36.701 --> 14:37.945
- You get on top.
- Oh, okay.

14:38.013 --> 14:39.279
- Get on top.
- Yeah.

14:39.347 --> 14:40.447
- Okay. Okay.
- Come on.

14:40.514 --> 14:41.948
Oh. Yeah.

14:42.016 --> 14:44.516
Josh! This is for Josh. Uh.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.013
- Oh, give it to me.
- Oh, yeah.

14:46.033 --> 14:47.554
Oh, I want it. Come on.

14:47.622 --> 14:49.089
(Sighs)

14:49.156 --> 14:51.025
- I want you to give it...
- Oh, my God. Yes.

14:51.093 --> 14:53.096
- Give it to me. Give it to me.
- Oh, yeah, give, give. Oh.

14:53.163 --> 14:54.230
- Uh, uh...
- Come on.

14:54.298 --> 14:56.134
Yeah, just let me...
Can I just go

14:56.201 --> 14:57.938
to the bathroom real quick?
Just two secs.

14:58.006 --> 14:59.341
Yeah. Just hurry. Go.

14:59.409 --> 15:02.177
Hurry. Hurry.

15:05.585 --> 15:07.821
Okay.

15:10.763 --> 15:12.724
Shit!

15:13.493 --> 15:15.301
Where is it? Where is it?
Where is it?!

15:16.545 --> 15:18.575
Shit! Think, think,
think, think, think.

15:18.643 --> 15:20.546
(Touch tones sounding)

15:20.613 --> 15:22.129
(Phone ringing) Hello.

15:22.149 --> 15:23.420
Yeah. Hi there. Hi.

15:23.440 --> 15:25.750
You just dropped me off
a few seconds ago.

15:25.818 --> 15:27.286
You are the drunk boy.

15:27.354 --> 15:29.523
I-I am the drunk boy.
Listen, this is

15:29.590 --> 15:31.624
kind of embarrassing,
but I lost my dick,

15:31.691 --> 15:33.058
so, can you just take a look

15:33.126 --> 15:34.359
and see if it's there?

15:34.427 --> 15:35.893
I don't see it.

15:35.961 --> 15:38.764
Wait. Uh, may-maybe it rolled
onto the floor.

15:38.831 --> 15:40.763
I see no dicks, my friend.

15:40.830 --> 15:43.665
Okay, all right. Uh, thank you.

15:43.732 --> 15:45.668
(Moaning) Hurry!

15:45.736 --> 15:47.636
Uh, just one-one second!

15:47.704 --> 15:50.405
(Phone ringing)
What up? What up?

15:50.473 --> 15:52.575
I'll check the... I'll check
the lost and found.

15:52.642 --> 15:53.903
Yeah.

15:55.080 --> 15:56.778
Yeah, there's a couple dicks
in here.

15:56.846 --> 15:58.279
Oh, great!

15:58.347 --> 15:59.714
- Is it pierced?
- No.

15:59.781 --> 16:01.515
- Does it have prongs?
- What?

16:01.582 --> 16:03.917
Oh, never mind.
That's a cell phone charger.

16:03.984 --> 16:05.486
It's not here.

16:05.554 --> 16:07.396
- Shit!
- Woman: Hey!

16:07.756 --> 16:10.473
Jared! Come on!

16:10.493 --> 16:12.994
Just one, uh, second!

16:13.062 --> 16:14.129
(Touch tones sounding)

16:14.197 --> 16:15.729
Uh, no,

16:15.797 --> 16:18.200
nobody turned in any dicks.
Sorry, buddy.

16:18.268 --> 16:19.903
Okay, uh, can-can you check
the men's room,

16:19.971 --> 16:22.406
because I know I had it
with me at the urinal?

16:22.474 --> 16:25.341
You're killing me, dude.
Hold on.

16:25.409 --> 16:27.210
Thank you.
(Door opens over phone)

16:27.278 --> 16:29.646
All right, I'm in the men's room
by the urinals here.

16:29.713 --> 16:31.045
Can't... whoa!

16:31.113 --> 16:35.884
(Thudding, gagging, retching)

16:35.952 --> 16:37.152
(Plopping) Bartender: Uh...

16:37.219 --> 16:38.551
What happened?

16:38.619 --> 16:40.486
Uh, I-I slipped on your dick.

16:40.554 --> 16:42.087
Then it flew in the air.

16:42.155 --> 16:44.188
I landed on my back, and I guess
my mouth was open,

16:44.256 --> 16:45.622
'cause it fell
right in my mouth.

16:45.690 --> 16:47.759
And then, I spat it out
and, well,

16:47.826 --> 16:49.527
long story short,
it's in the toilet.

16:49.595 --> 16:50.961
It's in the...? Oh, man.

16:51.029 --> 16:52.697
Can you please fish it out
for me?

16:52.765 --> 16:55.069
Well, I would, but the thing is,
last guy in here

16:55.137 --> 16:57.305
wasn't exactly an expert
in the fine art of flushing.

16:57.373 --> 16:58.939
Oh, my God. This is... this...

16:59.007 --> 17:00.841
Okay, well, I... I really,
really need it,

17:00.909 --> 17:02.609
like, right now, man.

17:02.677 --> 17:05.278
All right, fine,
I'll grab it. Hold...

17:05.345 --> 17:06.946
(Bartender yelling,
dog snarling and barking)

17:07.015 --> 17:08.646
Let go. Let go. Let go. Give me
the... give me that thing!

17:08.714 --> 17:10.214
Is that a dog?

17:10.282 --> 17:11.648
Stop it! Out of the mouth!

17:11.717 --> 17:13.117
(Bartender groans)

17:13.184 --> 17:14.417
What was all that?
(Dog whimpering)

17:14.484 --> 17:16.553
Uh, don't worry about it.

17:16.621 --> 17:19.057
Hey, come on!

17:19.125 --> 17:20.791
Oh, yeah, just a...
Just a minute!

17:20.859 --> 17:22.661
All right, man,
your dick will be

17:22.729 --> 17:25.265
in the cash register
for you tomorrow.

17:25.332 --> 17:26.896
No, no, no, no, man,
I need it right now.

17:26.964 --> 17:28.229
I'm-I'm with a girl, and
she wants to have sex with me!

17:28.296 --> 17:30.031
Well, you know,

17:30.099 --> 17:32.667
sex doesn't necessarily have
to involve a penis.

17:32.734 --> 17:34.466
Oh, my God.

17:34.533 --> 17:36.667
There are many ways for you
to be erotic with your partner.

17:36.735 --> 17:39.039
For instance, a-a long, intimate
conversation... sometimes

17:39.106 --> 17:42.506
that can be more sensual
than any penetrative act.

17:42.573 --> 17:44.774
Oh, this is
the worst night ever.

17:44.842 --> 17:46.343
Hey, buddy, how do you think
I feel?

17:46.411 --> 17:48.544
I just wrestled a pit bull
for a shit-covered dick.

17:48.612 --> 17:50.412
I think a thank you
might be in order.

17:50.480 --> 17:52.046
No, you-you make a fair point.

17:52.114 --> 17:53.750
I'm sorry. Thank you.

17:53.818 --> 17:55.185
All right. Well, you're welcome.

17:55.252 --> 17:56.976
Have a great night. Good luck.

17:57.921 --> 18:00.454
Oh, my God.

18:00.520 --> 18:02.588
Oh, finally.

18:02.656 --> 18:04.925
Um, Krystal, I-I'm sorry.

18:04.993 --> 18:06.360
I don't think I can.

18:06.428 --> 18:08.161
Oh, yes, you can.

18:08.228 --> 18:09.525
I can't. I'm sorry.
Uh, no. Oh, yeah?

18:09.593 --> 18:12.693
I can't. Uh, so... yeah.

18:12.760 --> 18:14.427
I-I'm... this has never...

18:14.495 --> 18:16.895
This doesn't usually
happen to me. Uh...

18:16.963 --> 18:18.898
Uh-huh.

18:18.965 --> 18:23.703
Do you want to have, like,
a long, intimate conversation?

18:24.053 --> 18:25.573
What?

18:25.640 --> 18:27.808
Yeah, yeah. Fair enough.

18:27.875 --> 18:30.177
- I hate me, too.
- Geez.

18:30.244 --> 18:32.012
(Phone buzzing)

18:34.018 --> 18:36.048
Hey, Josh, are you lost?

18:36.116 --> 18:38.017
I'm-I'm on the south side
of the park.

18:38.084 --> 18:39.719
I'm just gonna be,
uh, running loops.

18:39.787 --> 18:42.560
All right. I'm so proud of you!

18:44.593 --> 18:46.494
- Mike: Dude!
- What?

18:46.561 --> 18:48.894
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, man, I got so drunk,

18:48.962 --> 18:50.629
I forgot my credit
card at the bar.

18:50.697 --> 18:53.835
Oh, yeah, uh, that's-that's
also what I forgot.

18:53.903 --> 18:56.336
Man, last night was sick!

18:56.403 --> 18:57.970
Me and this banging
little skank tore

18:58.038 --> 18:59.907
through a ten-pack of condoms.

18:59.974 --> 19:02.209
Yeah. Oh. Filled her
up with my milk.

19:02.277 --> 19:04.109
- Milkman's coming. Hello.
- Yeah.

19:04.177 --> 19:07.480
(Laughs) Got, like, six
gallons of milk for you.

19:07.549 --> 19:09.081
Yeah, I get it, yeah.

19:09.149 --> 19:10.547
- I love this milk analogy, dude.
- Yeah.

19:10.614 --> 19:12.315
How'd it go with
that drunk chick?

19:12.382 --> 19:14.115
Yeah, very similar.

19:14.183 --> 19:16.617
Lots of, uh, milk, and, uh, it
was a very positive experience.

19:16.685 --> 19:18.653
(Laughs) Yeah.

19:18.720 --> 19:20.857
- Ooh, we crushed it, dawg.
- Oh, yeah.

19:20.925 --> 19:23.161
- What did I tell you, boy.
- Uh! (Groans)

19:23.228 --> 19:25.629
Hey, here are your dicks.

19:25.697 --> 19:27.998
Thank-thank you.

19:29.536 --> 19:31.986
(Groans)

19:33.947 --> 19:34.879
You want to, uh...

19:34.946 --> 19:36.814
You want to get a
bacon-egg-and-cheese, or...?

19:36.882 --> 19:39.184
Yeah, yeah.

19:39.251 --> 19:41.619
Uh...

19:41.687 --> 19:46.297
- I think we've got each other's.
- Yup. Yup, that's exactly... yup.
