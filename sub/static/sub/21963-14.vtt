WEBVTT

00:02.036 --> 00:03.304
You're teaming up
with the guys from Ghosted.

00:03.337 --> 00:05.039
I could have died
in there!

00:05.073 --> 00:06.974
Aw, somebody
need a hug?

00:07.007 --> 00:08.642
Catch all-new episodes Sundays.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.244
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:10.278 --> 00:13.081
The Orville, Gotham,
and Lucifer.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.548
Remember me?

00:14.582 --> 00:15.716
Only on Fox.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.587
What is tha... Ah.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.055
Who would have done this?

00:21.089 --> 00:22.756
Effective immediately,
I am taking over

00:22.790 --> 00:24.092
as director of this department.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.093
I can't even confirm

00:25.126 --> 00:26.760
that his badge is authentic.

00:26.794 --> 00:28.929
Listen, you messed up.
You got demoted-- it happens.

00:28.962 --> 00:31.232
Oh, I know
who bugged the office.

00:31.265 --> 00:33.167
Kenneth Lanier.

00:33.201 --> 00:34.902
The same dude who funded
the documentary

00:34.935 --> 00:35.936
They Came from Space.

00:35.969 --> 00:36.937
(muffled scream)

00:36.970 --> 00:39.540
-(both laughing)
-What?

00:39.573 --> 00:42.343
I just noticed you don't have on
your wedding ring.

00:42.376 --> 00:45.446
Anyway... (stammers)
I just wanted to...

00:45.479 --> 00:46.747
Maybe.

00:46.780 --> 00:49.950
(dogs barking)

00:49.983 --> 00:51.785
And this light you saw,
can you describe it?

00:51.819 --> 00:53.121
You've never seen light before?

00:53.154 --> 00:56.023
Excuse... Is that tape?

00:56.056 --> 00:57.558
It keeps out the spiders.

00:57.591 --> 00:58.592
How?

00:58.626 --> 01:00.194
With the sticky.

01:00.228 --> 01:01.962
And how did the light move?

01:01.995 --> 01:03.597
I don't know. I guess it was
attached to a ship.

01:03.631 --> 01:05.866
Right,
not what made it move but,

01:05.899 --> 01:07.635
like, what direction?

01:07.668 --> 01:09.970
Up, then back, then forward,
then up really high.

01:10.003 --> 01:13.574
(chuckling):
You're kind of short.

01:13.607 --> 01:14.808
How does the sticky
stop the spiders?

01:14.842 --> 01:15.876
Taste of their own medicine.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.978
So, you saw the light
in a field...

01:18.011 --> 01:20.648
Over the field.
You stupid?

01:20.681 --> 01:22.383
No, but you are.

01:22.416 --> 01:23.551
LEROY:
So the spider thinks,

01:23.584 --> 01:25.119
"This is what it's like
to be caught in a web"?

01:25.153 --> 01:27.921
The spider thinks, "Oh, no,
this woman is a giant spider,

01:27.955 --> 01:29.056
and I better not mess with it."

01:29.089 --> 01:31.559
MAX:
How did you hear about us?

01:31.592 --> 01:34.162
From The New York Times. Or,
from where I'm from, The Times.

01:34.195 --> 01:35.796
(timer beeps, dogs barking)

01:35.829 --> 01:39.099
Ooh, my spider soup is ready.

01:41.034 --> 01:43.036
*

01:44.872 --> 01:46.507
LEROY:
* Girls hit your hallelujah *

01:46.540 --> 01:48.642
-MAX: * Hey *
-* Girls hit your hallelujah *

01:48.676 --> 01:50.110
-* Ho! *
-* Girls hit your hallelujah *

01:50.144 --> 01:51.512
-* Yeah *
-* 'Cause uptown *

01:51.545 --> 01:53.147
BOTH:
* Funk gonna give it to you! *

01:53.181 --> 01:54.448
* 'Cause uptown funk's
gonna give it to you! *

01:54.482 --> 01:55.849
You've got that down, man!

01:55.883 --> 01:56.850
It's so exciting.
We're gonna see him.

01:56.884 --> 01:58.752
-BOTH: Tonight!
-Ooh-hoo!

01:58.786 --> 02:00.988
We're just going to the concert,
like it's no big deal.

02:01.021 --> 02:02.656
I'm telling you,
he puts on a show, man.

02:02.690 --> 02:04.992
I can't wait.
Can't wait. Uh...

02:05.025 --> 02:07.195
Oh, you know, I wanted to, uh...

02:07.228 --> 02:08.829
This is kind of weird,
just because

02:08.862 --> 02:10.030
I'm not really a signal guy.

02:10.063 --> 02:11.665
-You know?
-Signal guy?

02:11.699 --> 02:13.701
Yeah, like, I never did the sock
on the doorknob.

02:13.734 --> 02:15.703
Ah. Okay, okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.338
But, if at a certain point
tonight

02:17.371 --> 02:20.208
you see me do this...

02:20.241 --> 02:21.209
-Jazz hands.
-Right.

02:21.242 --> 02:24.612
Maybe give, uh,
Annie and I a moment?

02:24.645 --> 02:27.815
-A moment for you and Annie?
-Yeah, I don't know, it's...

02:27.848 --> 02:30.117
You know, it's been a while
since we checked in

02:30.150 --> 02:32.052
-on each other's vibes...
-Oh.

02:32.085 --> 02:33.721
-You know.
-I thought that was done
and buried.

02:33.754 --> 02:35.956
Well, she's been on my mind,

02:35.989 --> 02:38.359
and, uh... I don't know.
Whatever.

02:38.392 --> 02:39.660
I probably won't make a move
tonight.

02:39.693 --> 02:41.395
I don't think you should.

02:41.429 --> 02:43.464
What? Why?

02:43.497 --> 02:44.732
-(tire blows out)
-Whoa!

02:44.765 --> 02:45.733
Oh, my God.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.100
-Whoa!
-Hold on, hold on!

02:50.103 --> 02:52.306
We need to change this fast,
get back on the road.

02:52.340 --> 02:56.410
Or we could change it in
the time it takes to change it.

02:59.413 --> 03:02.416
Hey, what did you mean
I shouldn't ask out Annie?

03:02.450 --> 03:04.852
Ah, you know, coworkers.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.887
Things get tricky
with everything going on.

03:06.920 --> 03:10.491
Right. Is this because
of the jazz hands?

03:10.524 --> 03:11.892
'Cause it's not
a big deal at all.

03:11.925 --> 03:13.060
I could totally come up
with another signal.

03:13.093 --> 03:14.695
You know, like, uh...

03:14.728 --> 03:16.096
something less Broadway,
you know?

03:16.129 --> 03:17.898
Like, uh... Like, uh...

03:20.268 --> 03:22.069
-Is that a teapot?
-It's a teapot.

03:22.102 --> 03:25.439
That's right. I could work that
into a conversation.

03:25.473 --> 03:27.241
I don't think I can
make it tonight.

03:27.275 --> 03:28.876
(phone ringing)

03:28.909 --> 03:30.744
Okay, it's the restaurant
confirming

03:30.778 --> 03:32.079
our reservation for tonight.

03:32.112 --> 03:34.214
Hello.
Can you hold on one second?

03:34.248 --> 03:36.049
Are we still
a party of three, or...

03:36.083 --> 03:39.119
(sighs)
No.

03:39.152 --> 03:42.222
Okay, Leroy, listen,

03:42.256 --> 03:44.858
I can't keep Petite Poire
on hold forever, man.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.394
That's a very romantic
restaurant.

03:46.427 --> 03:48.362
Is it?

03:48.396 --> 03:50.631
How about this?

03:50.664 --> 03:52.900
If you want to go out with
someone, you ask her out,

03:52.933 --> 03:55.603
the two of you go,
and we'll call that

03:55.636 --> 03:58.472
Max's private romantic life.

03:58.506 --> 04:01.742
Okay. Confirmed.
Yeah, we'll see you tonight.

04:01.775 --> 04:03.877
Now, it's a patio table, right?

04:03.911 --> 04:06.714
Great. All right.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.449
Whoa.

04:08.482 --> 04:11.419
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:11.452 --> 04:14.154
Oh, check this out.
I'm gonna send this to Annie.

04:14.187 --> 04:15.923
She's a butterfly nut.

04:17.925 --> 04:20.661
Max...

04:40.047 --> 04:42.850
Did you...

04:42.883 --> 04:44.518
-I slept with Annie.
-...see that?

04:44.552 --> 04:46.487
Huh.

04:51.659 --> 04:55.128
So, like, you and Annie?
Or...

04:55.162 --> 04:57.465
I know it's kind of a bomb
to drop on you,

04:57.498 --> 04:59.433
and I was looking for
the right time to tell you,

04:59.467 --> 05:01.835
but then the UFO happened...

05:01.869 --> 05:03.804
Yeah, no, it's cool.
I mean...

05:03.837 --> 05:05.138
You know,
Annie and I never dated.

05:05.172 --> 05:06.139
-We were never even a thing.
-Right, right.

05:06.173 --> 05:08.576
So, who cares?

05:11.879 --> 05:14.448
We may have seen an alien ship,
like, a spaceship.

05:14.482 --> 05:17.985
Us! Paranormal investigators.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.720
-What are the odds, right?
-Unbelievable.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.555
So, were you guys, like,
on a date, or...?

05:21.589 --> 05:23.624
Max. Max, let's not
go down this road.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.025
-It only happened one time.
-Going down a road?

05:25.058 --> 05:26.394
-I'm just asking you a question.
-No. Wha... Max.

05:26.427 --> 05:27.728
I just didn't want
to hide it from you.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.397
Yeah. No,
and I'm glad you told me.

05:29.430 --> 05:30.798
-Like, I love having this info.
-Yeah.

05:30.831 --> 05:31.999
-You know?
-Good.

05:35.202 --> 05:37.237
-* Girls hit your hallelujah *
-(softly): * Hey *

05:37.270 --> 05:39.139
-* Girls hit your hallelujah *
-* Eh *

05:39.172 --> 05:41.575
* It's Saturday night,
and we're in the spot... *

05:45.112 --> 05:47.848
Sorry if I was a bad lover.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.249
It's just that,
since the election,

05:49.282 --> 05:50.718
I can only climax
in the fetal position.

05:50.751 --> 05:53.353
Shut up.
Why are you after me, Lanier?

05:53.387 --> 05:54.722
And why did you bug the Bureau?

05:54.755 --> 05:57.391
We weren't in the room.
All right!

05:57.425 --> 05:59.359
I'm part of an organization
called the Triangle Group.

05:59.393 --> 06:01.328
Yeah, don't be confused
by the hexagon logo.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.764
It was just a big, wild meeting
that went sideways.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.265
Why are you targeting me?

06:05.298 --> 06:07.768
And why did you bring that
Merv Minette in to replace me?!

06:07.801 --> 06:10.504
I don't know who that is or what
you're talking about. Ha-ha!

06:10.538 --> 06:14.508
Ah... Now, I get to ask you
a question.

06:14.542 --> 06:16.944
Who's the...?
Oh, no, wait.

06:16.977 --> 06:19.513
What's the...? Oh.
Uh, why could, uh...?

06:19.547 --> 06:21.515
Give me that, you idiot.

06:21.549 --> 06:23.884
All right...

06:23.917 --> 06:26.620
So there was no conspiracy
against me.

06:26.654 --> 06:30.223
I...
I just got demoted because...

06:31.959 --> 06:33.794
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.796
You want to hear the kookiest
part of all this?

06:35.829 --> 06:37.931
They're already here.

06:37.965 --> 06:39.533
Who's already here?

06:39.567 --> 06:43.103
We. We're already here.

06:45.238 --> 06:48.108
Okay, we're not saying for sure
that this is an alien craft

06:48.141 --> 06:50.410
that you're about to see,
but we have a pretty good...

06:50.444 --> 06:52.379
No, no, you're about to see it.
You want to see it?

06:52.412 --> 06:54.214
SASHA:
Let's just watch it, please.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.583
Here we go.

06:55.616 --> 06:57.618
-Excellent camerawork
from this one.
-Thank you.

06:57.651 --> 06:59.419
BIRD:
That's a butterfly, I think.

06:59.453 --> 07:01.054
-Why would you film a butterfly?
-BARRY: Boring!

07:01.088 --> 07:02.222
Heckle, heckle, bang the gong.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.057
Guys, it's not about
the butterfly. Okay?

07:04.091 --> 07:07.661
I mean, yes, it's very exciting
to see a tiger swallowtail

07:07.695 --> 07:09.162
-this early in the season. Okay?
-Rare.

07:09.196 --> 07:12.065
I get it,
but just keep watching.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.100
Whoa.

07:13.133 --> 07:14.568
Oh, my God.

07:14.602 --> 07:16.169
MAX:
It's zigzagging.

07:16.203 --> 07:18.005
-LINDA: Whoa, no way.
-BIRD: Could be
a punctured balloon.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.006
DAVEY: My wife cannot find out
about this.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.340
That was definitely something.

07:20.373 --> 07:22.476
-Did you get closer?
-LEROY: Watch this turn.

07:22.510 --> 07:25.078
-It's probably just a drone.
-Nothing can move like that.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.680
-That was no drone.
-MAX: Right?

07:26.714 --> 07:28.281
-Did you...
-LEROY: I slept with Annie.

07:28.315 --> 07:30.450
-...see that?
-(whispering): Turn it off.

07:30.484 --> 07:34.254
Tu... Off. Max.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.323
LEROY:
You hear me? Max.

07:36.356 --> 07:37.658
-LEROY: Turn it off.
-MAX: I can't...

07:37.691 --> 07:39.359
-Max.
-Yeah, I heard you.

07:39.392 --> 07:40.594
LEROY:
Still want to make a move,

07:40.628 --> 07:42.796
at least you know everything.

07:48.836 --> 07:51.505
BIRD:
Watch it again?

07:51.539 --> 07:52.640
Start right after
the UFO leaves?

07:52.673 --> 07:54.274
-Yeah.
-I think so, yeah...

07:54.307 --> 07:55.509
-(indistinct chatter)
-MERV: Hey, that-that's enough.

07:55.543 --> 07:56.677
That's enough.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.311
No one's watching anything.

07:58.345 --> 08:01.448
When I was your age,
we didn't have TV at work.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.950
Just find out
the real explanation.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.986
For the UFO
or the Leroy-Annie thing?

08:06.019 --> 08:07.955
ANNIE and LEROY:
The UFO.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.957
MERV:
The thing on the video.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.892
For the love of God,
don't call it a UFO.

08:11.925 --> 08:12.960
Makes us sound stupid.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.828
(quietly):
So, how was it?

08:14.862 --> 08:16.964
Sasha.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.199
It just seems to me like you
didn't have to tell him at all.

08:19.232 --> 08:21.535
To not to tell him would've been
unfair to all three of us.

08:21.569 --> 08:23.370
How would it have been
unfair to me?

08:23.403 --> 08:25.038
Okay, to me and Max, then,

08:25.072 --> 08:26.807
but I just wanted
to include you.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.341
Well, you have made things
really hard for me.

08:28.375 --> 08:30.844
He was gonna ask you out.

08:30.878 --> 08:32.846
So? What does that
have to do with you?

08:34.047 --> 08:36.416
Okay, sure.

08:36.449 --> 08:38.018
(sighs)

08:40.588 --> 08:42.590
(elevator bell chimes)

08:51.098 --> 08:53.701
Ava.
Taking off?

08:53.734 --> 08:54.902
Just coming back, actually.

08:54.935 --> 08:57.504
Of course.
You were missed.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.072
Maybe it's a good thing
that you're here,

08:59.106 --> 09:01.775
in this office.

09:01.809 --> 09:05.746
Perhaps I haven't been fair
about recognizing that.

09:05.779 --> 09:07.414
Was that one of the steps
you learned at your mental spa?

09:07.447 --> 09:09.449
I just hope
that none of my actions

09:09.482 --> 09:12.620
have compromised
our mission in any way.

09:12.653 --> 09:15.022
Worst case scenario,
you scared off a ghost or two,

09:15.055 --> 09:17.390
but we'll be fine.

09:24.732 --> 09:28.068
Uh, look, I'm here
if you need me, so, you know,

09:28.101 --> 09:29.803
I know this place inside
and out, and frankly...

09:29.837 --> 09:31.038
Do you know
how to work that-that

09:31.071 --> 09:33.707
single cup pod plungey thing?

09:33.741 --> 09:34.808
The coffee maker?

09:34.842 --> 09:36.276
It's supposed to be simpler,

09:36.309 --> 09:37.778
but I just can't seem
to figure it out.

09:40.313 --> 09:42.082
Well, maybe if there were,
you know,

09:42.115 --> 09:44.952
posted, clear instructions.

09:44.985 --> 09:47.254
Yes, yes! You know, like,
a one, two, three.

09:47.287 --> 09:48.488
-Brilliant.
-Yep.

09:48.521 --> 09:49.589
Thank you.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.760
Ken, did you find anything
from the NOAA database?

09:52.793 --> 09:54.795
No, nothing.

09:54.828 --> 09:59.299
Um, Bird, there was nothing
reported from SpaceX?

09:59.332 --> 10:01.101
Did you say "space sex"?

10:01.134 --> 10:02.836
(laughter)

10:02.870 --> 10:04.471
ANNIE:
Really?

10:04.504 --> 10:06.640
Okay.

10:06.674 --> 10:08.842
The object wasn't
on any known flight path.

10:08.876 --> 10:10.510
It didn't come
from any regional airports.

10:10.543 --> 10:13.413
JPL has nothing,
FAA has nothing.

10:13.446 --> 10:14.782
I-I just don't get it.

10:14.815 --> 10:17.150
(chuckling):
Not what I heard.

10:17.184 --> 10:19.052
(stifled laughter)

10:24.725 --> 10:26.326
(door opens)

10:26.359 --> 10:28.595
-Whoa, Ava.
-Hey.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.097
Did you get your groove back?

10:30.130 --> 10:32.099
I did not.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.500
I heard about the UFO.

10:33.533 --> 10:35.502
And you and Leroy.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.271
(sighs)

10:38.305 --> 10:41.308
It's hard to be a woman at work.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.346
I want to redefine myself.

10:50.818 --> 10:52.385
I want to get in front of this.

10:52.419 --> 10:54.287
I want to know
what I'm about again.

10:54.321 --> 10:57.024
I want people
to shut up about this

10:57.057 --> 10:58.325
and move on.

10:58.358 --> 11:01.394
You are going to seize control.

11:01.428 --> 11:03.964
You got that?

11:03.997 --> 11:05.733
You're a freakin'
badass goddess,

11:05.766 --> 11:07.968
and you are scared of no one.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.536
You will control this.

11:09.569 --> 11:10.704
You.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.643
Hmm.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.245
Thanks.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.549
-(door opens)
-No.

11:22.582 --> 11:24.384
Thank you.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.553
You're welcome.

11:26.586 --> 11:28.722
-Hey.
-Oh, hey.

11:28.756 --> 11:30.357
Can I hide in here for a minute?

11:30.390 --> 11:32.192
-Sure.
-(sighs)

11:32.225 --> 11:34.061
Hey, why the sad face, champ?

11:34.094 --> 11:37.597
-I know I shouldn't be upset,
Barry, but I am.
-Oh.

11:37.630 --> 11:39.767
Get rid of the word "should,"
just get rid of it.

11:39.800 --> 11:40.934
Right.

11:40.968 --> 11:44.037
I ought not to be upset...

11:44.071 --> 11:46.106
Oughtn't you?

11:46.139 --> 11:49.109
It's embarrassing, actually,
to have this reaction.

11:49.142 --> 11:50.510
I never dated Annie.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.045
I never asked her out.

11:52.079 --> 11:53.881
What's this little girl
saying in there?

11:53.914 --> 11:56.850
Tap, tap, tap. Tap.

11:56.884 --> 11:58.618
Sh-She's sad.

11:58.651 --> 12:01.755
Sad because you like Annie,
and she screwed your partner.

12:01.789 --> 12:04.758
Okay, a-all right.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.459
How do I get past this?

12:06.493 --> 12:08.728
You have to shag somebody
Leroy likes.

12:08.762 --> 12:10.130
That's bad advice.

12:10.163 --> 12:11.965
Or-or you could
just get with Annie.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.435
Yeah, maybe I ought.

12:15.468 --> 12:17.104
Hmm?

12:17.137 --> 12:18.839
Maybe I ought.

12:22.109 --> 12:23.977
Oh, balls.

12:24.011 --> 12:25.445
So,

12:25.478 --> 12:28.281
I, um...

12:28.315 --> 12:30.483
just got off the phone
with my lawyer.

12:30.517 --> 12:32.419
No, that's not a good way
to start. Um...

12:33.854 --> 12:35.823
Hello.

12:35.856 --> 12:39.226
I... just got off the phone
with a lawyer

12:39.259 --> 12:42.996
who says I cannot
ignore complaints

12:43.030 --> 12:45.966
of a sexual milieu,

12:45.999 --> 12:47.667
as much as I'd like to.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.336
Any questions so far?

12:49.369 --> 12:50.503
Are you okay?

12:50.537 --> 12:52.505
No.
Last time I had to do this,

12:52.539 --> 12:54.908
I was a head counselor
at a camp in the Poconos.

12:54.942 --> 12:58.311
If anybody needs, uh, vodka,
there's some in my office.

13:02.715 --> 13:04.684
Okay, look,

13:04.717 --> 13:07.420
these are difficult times.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.489
Everywhere you look,
there's booby traps.

13:09.522 --> 13:10.858
You know,

13:10.891 --> 13:13.193
"Can you say this?
Can you touch that?"

13:13.226 --> 13:15.495
Maybe I shouldn't
have said "touch."

13:15.528 --> 13:16.763
Maybe you shouldn't
have said "booby."

13:16.796 --> 13:18.932
I didn't.
"Booby trap" is separate

13:18.966 --> 13:20.934
from, you know, chesticles...

13:20.968 --> 13:21.935
Who made the complaint?

13:21.969 --> 13:23.136
Oh, that's confidential.

13:23.170 --> 13:24.137
Was it Sasha?

13:24.171 --> 13:25.138
No.

13:25.172 --> 13:26.206
Ken?

13:26.239 --> 13:27.474
-No.
-Barry?

13:27.507 --> 13:28.708
-No.
-Davey?

13:28.741 --> 13:30.944
-Can't say.
-Mm.

13:30.978 --> 13:33.713
I complained
because I'm married,

13:33.746 --> 13:36.383
and I don't think it's fair for
the single people in this office

13:36.416 --> 13:38.318
to be banging each other
right in my face.

13:38.351 --> 13:39.519
LINDA:
That is disgusting.

13:39.552 --> 13:41.321
And sad.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.056
-Sad is not the half of it.
-MERV: Okay.

13:43.090 --> 13:45.525
Why don't we just say
"no dating in the office,"

13:45.558 --> 13:47.060
and we can end this thing?

13:47.094 --> 13:49.162
KEN: I read they have
a policy at Facebook,

13:49.196 --> 13:51.364
where you can ask an employee
out once, and if they say no,

13:51.398 --> 13:53.733
you can't ask them out again.

13:53.766 --> 13:55.802
Well, that's good.
Let's do that.

13:55.835 --> 13:59.706
Um, but what if you have a
strong suspicion that the person

13:59.739 --> 14:02.509
only said no because of a beard,

14:02.542 --> 14:04.344
and then you shave the beard?

14:05.778 --> 14:08.748
Well, then you,
you get to ask again.

14:08.781 --> 14:11.985
So, let's say you can...
you can do it twice, you know,

14:12.019 --> 14:15.388
providing you have some
significant physical alteration.

14:15.422 --> 14:17.925
Can we all just agree
this entire conversation

14:17.958 --> 14:19.559
is unnecessary?

14:19.592 --> 14:20.928
Oh, is it?

14:20.961 --> 14:22.162
-Yep.
-Really?

14:22.195 --> 14:23.931
-Really.
-All right, 'cause I was

14:23.964 --> 14:26.166
wondering, I don't know,
what if you had a coworker

14:26.199 --> 14:28.936
that you considered,
like, your closest friend,

14:28.969 --> 14:31.838
and they went on a date
with another coworker...

14:31.871 --> 14:33.240
This is the worst code ever.

14:33.273 --> 14:35.375
-...who you specifically
did not ask out.
-That's right.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.210
They didn't.

14:37.244 --> 14:39.947
-That guy didn't.
-Because you were still
getting over a failed marriage,

14:39.980 --> 14:41.781
which said coworker

14:41.814 --> 14:44.084
totally knew about because of
your numerous discussions

14:44.117 --> 14:45.953
on the drive in to work.
I'm just curious

14:45.986 --> 14:47.887
-what the policy is on that.
-Oh, my God, make it end.

14:47.921 --> 14:49.456
I'm trying.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.091
Maybe the policy
should be acceptance

14:51.124 --> 14:53.026
because you are a grown-up

14:53.060 --> 14:56.096
with full knowledge
that dibs are for kids.

14:56.129 --> 14:58.765
The world doesn't stop
because you're not ready.

14:58.798 --> 15:01.534
Maybe the rest of the world
has a bunch of drinks

15:01.568 --> 15:04.871
at Campos de Oaxaca
and whatever "happah, happah."

15:04.904 --> 15:07.474
-You guys, we saw a UFO.
-MAX: Campos de Oaxaca?

15:07.507 --> 15:08.641
I remember that night.

15:08.675 --> 15:09.943
Yes, we were all there together,

15:09.977 --> 15:12.545
having some drinks,
and you chose to go home

15:12.579 --> 15:15.048
and binge-watch
The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.

15:15.082 --> 15:16.616
Well, I didn't know
there was a secret plan

15:16.649 --> 15:18.451
for me to go home
and for you to go...

15:18.485 --> 15:19.919
Don't get hung up
on the details.

15:19.953 --> 15:21.821
My place, okay?
We went back to my place.

15:21.854 --> 15:23.423
LINDA:
Ooh, ouch.

15:23.456 --> 15:24.791
Ouchie, ouchie.

15:27.961 --> 15:29.963
MAX:
Okay.

15:29.997 --> 15:33.133
Annie, can I speak
with you, please?

15:33.166 --> 15:35.835
We're right
in the middle of this.

15:36.869 --> 15:38.871
(overlapping whispers)

15:42.809 --> 15:44.011
Okay.

15:47.814 --> 15:49.516
Um...

15:49.549 --> 15:51.484
Yes, it is totally

15:51.518 --> 15:55.455
on me for not doing this
a long time ago, so here I am,

15:55.488 --> 15:58.625
risking it all, and, uh...

15:58.658 --> 16:01.828
Annie, will you go out
to dinner with me?

16:01.861 --> 16:04.964
-No.
-(laughs)

16:04.998 --> 16:07.367
Um, right, uh...

16:07.400 --> 16:09.869
so let's just call it a date,
and it can be any time,

16:09.902 --> 16:12.805
-like, dinner or whatever.
-No, no.

16:12.839 --> 16:15.442
I'm sorry, but no.

16:15.475 --> 16:18.145
(sighs)

16:18.178 --> 16:19.846
-Uh...
-You okay?

16:19.879 --> 16:21.148
Yeah.

16:21.181 --> 16:23.883
You know what?
I'm angry, actually.

16:23.916 --> 16:24.951
I didn't make him...

16:24.984 --> 16:26.853
Um, I am angry at Leroy

16:26.886 --> 16:29.356
-because he makes
this impossible.
-It's not Leroy.

16:29.389 --> 16:31.824
-What...
-It complicates things,
wouldn't you say?

16:31.858 --> 16:33.226
-No!
-You and Leroy

16:33.260 --> 16:35.462
-may be complicating it?
-No. No. I... It doesn't.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.130
I'm sorry. No.

16:37.164 --> 16:38.865
But... like...
(stammers)

16:38.898 --> 16:40.900
Just months ago we were, like,
flirting all the time.

16:40.933 --> 16:44.237
You were flirting. You're great.
I just don't feel that way.

16:46.873 --> 16:49.909
But... you said "maybe."

16:49.942 --> 16:52.979
Yeah, a big chunk of "maybe"

16:53.012 --> 16:54.581
is no.

16:54.614 --> 16:57.016
Right.

16:57.050 --> 16:59.752
So... you're not into me?

16:59.786 --> 17:02.389
No.

17:02.422 --> 17:04.724
You're really
not-not-not into me?

17:04.757 --> 17:09.262
I-I'm usually not this off.
This is... blowing my mind.

17:09.296 --> 17:10.930
Is it one of those
things where, like,

17:10.963 --> 17:13.866
you can't get close
to someone that you like?

17:13.900 --> 17:16.035
No, I can if I want to.

17:16.069 --> 17:19.839
Well... all right.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.242
I mean, you've, you know,
thrown a lot at me here,

17:22.275 --> 17:23.576
and, uh, I feel like, uh...

17:23.610 --> 17:25.245
I don't know.
I'll just take some time

17:25.278 --> 17:27.114
and mull it over
and I'll let you know.

17:27.147 --> 17:28.948
-Sure. Okay.
-Cool.

17:28.981 --> 17:31.050
But if you have
any other questions,

17:31.084 --> 17:33.286
the answer is probably no.

17:33.320 --> 17:34.821
-Yeah.
-(door opens)

17:36.256 --> 17:38.258
-(sighs)
-(door closes)

17:44.397 --> 17:45.932
So, uh...

17:45.965 --> 17:47.567
-I have a question.
-Not now, man.

17:47.600 --> 17:48.968
No, it's okay, now is good.

17:49.001 --> 17:50.470
I went through
a very similar experience,

17:50.503 --> 17:51.771
and I thought it might help

17:51.804 --> 17:54.073
you guys to hear it.
Uh, two years ago,

17:54.107 --> 17:57.076
I was hiking in the
Pacific Crest Trail

17:57.110 --> 18:01.414
when I came upon the most
radiant beauty I had ever seen.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.616
For the purposes of this story,
I'll call her Sierra.

18:03.650 --> 18:06.286
-Is that her name?
-Is that whose name?

18:06.319 --> 18:08.988
-Sierra.
-I don't know anybody
by that name.

18:09.021 --> 18:10.423
Meeting adjourned.

18:10.457 --> 18:11.591
So, we walk for some distance,

18:11.624 --> 18:12.992
and she invites me
back to her place.

18:13.025 --> 18:15.162
-I say, "Okay," and...
-Is this a question?

18:15.195 --> 18:18.465
There is no bigger question.

18:18.498 --> 18:19.832
Also, I wasn't interrupting you

18:19.866 --> 18:21.501
when you were
sleeping with Annie,

18:21.534 --> 18:24.771
so I would appreciate
similar courtesy. And, uh...

18:24.804 --> 18:26.939
right away,

18:26.973 --> 18:28.441
things get heated. Um...

18:28.475 --> 18:29.909
It would be inappropriate

18:29.942 --> 18:33.180
for me to tell you
what happened,

18:33.213 --> 18:35.815
but let's just say
there was some French kissing,

18:35.848 --> 18:37.250
that's the kind with tongue.

18:37.284 --> 18:39.419
She used her tongue

18:39.452 --> 18:41.921
to remove her clothes
and my clothes

18:41.954 --> 18:44.023
and she led me
down to her bedroom,

18:44.056 --> 18:47.160
where her friend was waiting.
I'm gonna call her...

18:47.194 --> 18:49.496
Sierra.

18:49.529 --> 18:53.132
And they asked me
to lie facedown on a table,

18:53.166 --> 18:54.767
and I said, "Absolutely."

18:54.801 --> 18:58.104
And we put the "F" in UFO.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.006
And...

19:00.039 --> 19:01.708
about a minute later,
perhaps less,

19:01.741 --> 19:03.443
we put the "O" in UFO.

19:03.476 --> 19:06.313
And I woke up in the woods

19:06.346 --> 19:07.880
the next morning,

19:07.914 --> 19:10.883
and I didn't have a belly button
anymore, but I felt amazing.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.519
-Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.
-So... Okay.

19:12.552 --> 19:15.222
And ever since that night,

19:15.255 --> 19:16.389
-my penis...
-(giggles)

19:16.423 --> 19:18.791
...has become magnetized,
but to aluminum,

19:18.825 --> 19:22.028
and it makes cooking difficult,

19:22.061 --> 19:25.865
and it makes baking impossible.

19:25.898 --> 19:27.500
(Max and Leroy laughing)

19:27.534 --> 19:31.070
So, thank you
for your supportive laughter.

19:31.103 --> 19:33.440
Mm-hmm.

19:39.011 --> 19:41.013
("Tales and Truths"
by Black Apples playing)

19:45.852 --> 19:48.688
* How can I reach you? *

19:48.721 --> 19:50.590
* Someway *

19:50.623 --> 19:52.825
* Somehow *

19:52.859 --> 19:54.261
(elevator bell dings)

19:56.229 --> 19:59.065
* I hear tales and truths *

19:59.098 --> 20:03.503
* About your hurtful ways *

20:03.536 --> 20:05.305
* Ooh *

20:07.307 --> 20:09.208
* Oh *

20:09.242 --> 20:12.178
* What you do *

20:12.211 --> 20:14.914
* Oh *

20:14.947 --> 20:17.183
* What you do *

20:17.216 --> 20:19.286
* Oh *

20:19.319 --> 20:22.289
* Oh... *

20:22.322 --> 20:25.525
Hey, did you know that she
didn't like me that way?

20:25.558 --> 20:28.295
No.

20:28.328 --> 20:31.063
B-But you know
who does like you?

20:31.097 --> 20:33.466
The lady with the tape
in her hair.

20:35.768 --> 20:39.138
Yeah. I slept with her,
and I'm sorry for you.

20:39.171 --> 20:40.373
That must hurt to hear.

20:40.407 --> 20:42.942
It does hurt to hear.

20:42.975 --> 20:44.777
Spider lady trapped you up, huh?

20:46.346 --> 20:49.482
Well, I'm sorry about that.

20:49.516 --> 20:52.819
Sorry, too, man.

20:52.852 --> 20:54.454
LaFREY:
Gross.

20:54.487 --> 20:57.324
My own vows
weren't that romantic.

20:57.357 --> 20:58.925
We need to talk.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.993
Then Lanier started talking
about this organization

21:01.027 --> 21:03.162
called the Triangle Group.
Now, they may be based...

21:03.195 --> 21:04.964
-What, from the math?
-What math?

21:04.997 --> 21:06.399
Gromov's non-Euclidean

21:06.433 --> 21:08.000
crystallographic theory
of infinite light.

21:09.469 --> 21:12.238
Well, he-he didn't mention that,
no, but, uh...

21:12.271 --> 21:15.742
-Oh! He did say, "We are here."
-Who is here?

21:15.775 --> 21:19.011
If he'd said who, I probably
would have led with that.

21:19.045 --> 21:20.012
MAX and LEROY:
We, we...

21:20.046 --> 21:23.483
We, we, we, we,
we, we, we, we...

21:23.516 --> 21:24.917
That and triangle.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.919
BOTH:
Triangle, triangle, triangle...

21:26.953 --> 21:30.990
Tri-angle...
That's three angles.

21:31.023 --> 21:32.725
I never thought about that word.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.662
How could that never have
occurred to you?

21:35.695 --> 21:37.964
It's not "squa-are."

21:37.997 --> 21:39.532
-What?
-Squa-are.

21:40.867 --> 21:42.369
Triangle, triangle, triangle...

21:42.402 --> 21:44.170
-Triangles.
-Triangle, triangle, triangle.

21:44.203 --> 21:45.972
Triangles, triangles...

21:49.008 --> 21:50.943
