WEBVTT

00:14.872 --> 00:16.290
Well, this is me.

00:16.290 --> 00:19.001
That's right.
Are you okay?

00:19.001 --> 00:21.170
Yeah.
You okay to drive?

00:21.170 --> 00:22.713
What, do I seem...?

00:23.423 --> 00:24.841
Happy?

00:26.926 --> 00:29.512
I haven't seen that smile
on your face in a while.

00:32.305 --> 00:33.391
Yeah.

00:35.268 --> 00:38.646
You know, for the past two years,
every morning when I wake up,

00:40.440 --> 00:43.067
I'd have this thought
that comes to my head:

00:44.318 --> 00:45.611
Raymond is dead.

00:47.697 --> 00:49.157
And now, in these ...

00:51.242 --> 00:52.994
in these past
few weeks,

00:54.454 --> 00:57.498
it's just not the
first thing I think of.

01:00.960 --> 01:02.295
You going to bring
Ray Junior tomorrow?

01:02.295 --> 01:03.504
Is that all right?
Yeah.

01:03.504 --> 01:04.464
Looking forward to it.

01:04.464 --> 01:06.215
Good.
Thank you.

01:06.215 --> 01:08.301
Good night.
Good night.

01:12.138 --> 01:13.181
Drive safe.

01:28.529 --> 01:29.614
Detective Caine?

01:29.614 --> 01:30.823
Can I help you?

01:31.240 --> 01:32.450
Pete Wilton.

01:33.076 --> 01:35.787
Knocked off a chain of grocery
stores about six years ago?

01:35.787 --> 01:38.414
You caught me
in Liberty City?

01:38.414 --> 01:39.707
I remember, Pete.

01:39.707 --> 01:42.710
Good Samaritan got hit and
you got manslaughter, right?

01:42.710 --> 01:44.879
Yeah, and your testimony
helped put me away.

01:44.879 --> 01:46.506
Is that why you've
been following me?

01:47.048 --> 01:49.801
I'm two years into my parole,
and I've got a problem.

01:50.218 --> 01:51.677
Pete,

01:51.677 --> 01:54.305
if you make that move,
it's going to be your last.

01:54.305 --> 01:56.891
Relax, Lieutenant,
it's a photograph.

01:56.891 --> 01:59.310
Take it out.
Slowly.

02:05.900 --> 02:06.859
It's my son.

02:07.777 --> 02:08.860
Jeff.

02:09.487 --> 02:11.781
Went to school three days
ago and never came back.

02:14.700 --> 02:16.035
You call 911?

02:16.035 --> 02:17.495
Yeah, I went to PD,

02:17.495 --> 02:19.580
but they're not too
concerned with parolees' kids.

02:20.623 --> 02:22.375
He's not the
way I used to be.

02:23.835 --> 02:26.170
I know that something
happened to him.

02:26.170 --> 02:26.963
Okay, well, I'm sure ...

02:26.963 --> 02:28.172
the detectives
are on it. Let me call.

02:28.172 --> 02:29.799
No.
It's got to be you.

02:30.633 --> 02:32.885
Look, I was guilty.
And you knew it.

02:32.885 --> 02:34.762
You came after me with
everything you had.

02:35.179 --> 02:36.347
And I saw that.

02:37.807 --> 02:39.976
I know you can
find my boy.

02:39.976 --> 02:41.310
What kind of trouble
was he in?

02:41.310 --> 02:43.187
None.
Really.

02:43.187 --> 02:45.606
No, I just figured if you
could bulldog a guy like me,

02:45.606 --> 02:48.443
you could do half as
good with a good kid.

02:49.068 --> 02:50.236
Worth saving.

02:52.238 --> 02:53.781
Okay, Pete,
listen to me.

02:53.781 --> 02:56.701
If you're lying, I'm out.
You understand?

02:56.701 --> 02:57.785
I do.

02:59.662 --> 03:00.705
Thank you.

03:13.885 --> 03:16.596
Right, right, he backed up
into your knife eleven times.

03:17.013 --> 03:18.347
Sit tight, Kilroy ...

03:19.265 --> 03:21.934
while I, uh, rustle up
some booking slips.

03:22.894 --> 03:24.771
Got a minute?
Thirty seconds.

03:25.271 --> 03:27.356
Okay, Jeff Wilton.

03:28.191 --> 03:29.317
Who?

03:29.609 --> 03:31.736
Jeff Wilton is a high school
kid from homestead ...

03:31.736 --> 03:33.821
that disappeared
three days ago.

03:34.322 --> 03:35.698
Father's an ex-con.

03:35.698 --> 03:37.158
And a concerned parent.

03:37.158 --> 03:38.534
A divorced parent.

03:38.534 --> 03:41.662
Soon as he got out, wife
took off, left the kid behind.

03:41.662 --> 03:43.581
Told the neighbor she
liked the guy fine enough,

03:43.581 --> 03:44.874
as long as he
was in prison.

03:44.874 --> 03:46.793
You think the kid
did the same thing?

03:47.335 --> 03:49.670
No, I think Jeff's in the keys
with a cheerleader.

03:49.670 --> 03:51.547
I think he'll run out of money,
stroll back in a couple of days

03:51.547 --> 03:54.884
with a hickey on his neck
and a smile on his face.

03:54.884 --> 03:55.968
What if he doesn't?

03:55.968 --> 03:58.846
I got twelve confirmed dead
yanking at my chain right now.

03:58.846 --> 04:01.099
So you're not interested in
the kid unless he's dead?

04:01.099 --> 04:01.974
You know what I mean.

04:01.974 --> 04:03.267
Okay, Frank,

04:03.267 --> 04:05.353
why don't you let me take
this one off your hands.

04:05.895 --> 04:07.647
There's no crime
scene to investigate.

04:07.647 --> 04:08.815
Maybe not,

04:08.815 --> 04:10.274
but that doesn't mean
there wasn't a crime.

04:46.519 --> 04:49.647
1x20 Grave Young Men

05:06.496 --> 05:08.665
I want to be
sure I got it right.

05:08.665 --> 05:11.626
You and the deceased
had drinks last night,

05:11.626 --> 05:13.711
came back here
around midnight ...

05:13.711 --> 05:16.381
Made love ...
for ...

05:16.381 --> 05:18.007
I don't know how long.

05:18.007 --> 05:20.635
And when I woke up
this morning,

05:21.886 --> 05:24.430
he was beside me...

05:24.430 --> 05:25.723
dead.

05:25.723 --> 05:26.766
Thanks.

05:27.475 --> 05:28.643
Bernstein?

05:30.103 --> 05:31.187
Speedle.

05:31.521 --> 05:32.272
Who are you?

05:32.272 --> 05:34.357
I'm a Crime Scene
Investigator.

05:38.319 --> 05:39.904
I thought you were
the Detective.

05:39.904 --> 05:40.655
I am.

05:40.655 --> 05:42.907
But Speedle
analyzes the scene.

05:42.907 --> 05:45.827
The forensic that might
explain the death in question.

05:54.210 --> 05:56.087
Do you have any
questions for me?

05:56.713 --> 05:57.797
Yeah.

05:58.715 --> 06:01.426
Why do women
do that to their nails?

06:01.426 --> 06:02.635
What?

06:02.635 --> 06:04.429
Put little charms on them?

06:04.846 --> 06:06.764
It's easy.
To attract men.

06:09.684 --> 06:11.561
Hey, do you mind
taking that tea ...

06:11.561 --> 06:12.812
and drinking it
over there?

06:13.563 --> 06:14.689
Sure ...

06:15.106 --> 06:16.357
whatever helps.

06:23.656 --> 06:26.200
Well, the guy was
in good shape.

06:26.200 --> 06:28.036
She said he
runs marathons.

06:28.036 --> 06:29.704
Well, ran.

06:30.747 --> 06:32.248
May have an enlarged heart.

06:32.248 --> 06:34.375
Something of
the pulmonary nature.

06:36.878 --> 06:38.296
Frenulum isn't torn.

06:39.339 --> 06:42.050
Tardieu spots in the
conjunctivae and eyelids.

06:42.050 --> 06:43.343
Asphyxiation?

06:44.177 --> 06:45.470
Sleep apnea?

06:45.470 --> 06:46.804
Hard to tell.

06:46.804 --> 06:50.141
Almost impossible to distinguish
accidental from homicide.

06:50.141 --> 06:52.644
Result of closing off the air
to the windpipe's the same.

06:54.437 --> 06:57.690
Blood stops carrying
oxygen to the alveoli.

06:58.733 --> 07:00.985
I'd say he fell
asleep in his pillow.

07:00.985 --> 07:02.904
If I hadn't watched
Miss Thing ...

07:02.904 --> 07:05.114
put her suave
on Bernstein earlier.

07:13.373 --> 07:14.707
This is Jeff's room.

07:14.707 --> 07:16.334
I didn't touch anything.

07:16.334 --> 07:19.587
Left everything just the way it
was the morning he left for school.

07:19.587 --> 07:20.338
Okay.

07:20.338 --> 07:22.799
You know, Pete, I am going to
take you up on that coffee now.

07:22.799 --> 07:24.133
Sure.
Okay.

07:24.133 --> 07:25.343
Make it two,
if you don't mind.

07:25.343 --> 07:27.011
You got it.
Thanks.

07:50.159 --> 07:51.619
"Three-in-one oil."

07:52.036 --> 07:54.497
Used to use that
to make boat models.

07:56.583 --> 07:58.668
Now I use it
to clean my gun.

08:06.175 --> 08:07.510
What do we have here?

08:09.596 --> 08:11.806
"Four Twenty Boyz."

08:11.806 --> 08:13.391
Time to get high, I bet.

08:13.975 --> 08:14.892
How do you know that?

08:14.892 --> 08:18.605
My brother worked
narcotics undercover.

08:19.647 --> 08:21.316
So, Jeff ...

08:24.402 --> 08:25.486
where is it?

08:29.741 --> 08:31.659
Our friend Jeff is a stoner.

08:33.953 --> 08:34.913
His father lied.

08:34.913 --> 08:37.664
You see, kids make
excellent criminals.

08:37.664 --> 08:39.250
They're sneaky.

08:40.501 --> 08:41.919
Here's how it
might've gone.

08:44.005 --> 08:46.132
Jeff sits up here at night,
in the dark,

08:46.132 --> 08:48.343
without his dad
being any the wiser.

08:54.599 --> 08:56.267
This is gunshot residue.

08:56.559 --> 08:57.852
And it's possible ...

08:58.895 --> 09:00.063
Jeff ...

09:01.105 --> 09:02.440
was doing more ...

09:03.399 --> 09:05.485
than smoking out
this window.

09:36.933 --> 09:39.936
Wow, someone definitely used
this tree for target practice.

09:39.936 --> 09:42.188
Not all the bullet
holes are fresh, either.

09:42.188 --> 09:42.939
Calleigh,

09:42.939 --> 09:45.316
how many different weapons do
you think have been used here?

09:47.193 --> 09:50.738
Well, I see nines, .22s,
there's even some rifle action.

09:50.738 --> 09:52.699
I'll be able to tell you more
when I get it back to the lab.

09:52.699 --> 09:54.742
Okay, so weed, bullets,

09:54.742 --> 09:56.703
let's go over to Jeff's
high school locker ...

09:56.703 --> 09:59.122
and see what other
surprises he has for us.

09:59.122 --> 10:01.583
School property could take
a day to get permission.

10:01.583 --> 10:02.375
Red tape.

10:02.375 --> 10:04.586
Cut through it
as fast as you can.

10:04.586 --> 10:06.671
And the same
goes for this tree.

10:13.177 --> 10:14.762
You're not going
to roll him?

10:14.762 --> 10:16.889
Think our boy's
been moved enough.

10:16.889 --> 10:18.224
Dual lividity.

10:18.224 --> 10:20.977
Body laid on its stomach,
then was flipped over.

10:21.269 --> 10:22.520
The paramedics
must've flipped him.

10:22.520 --> 10:25.899
No. No, he was on his stomach
long enough for blood to settle.

10:26.190 --> 10:27.358
Couple of hours.

10:34.532 --> 10:38.494
But before that, he was
dead on his back ...

10:38.494 --> 10:39.746
another couple hours.

10:44.417 --> 10:49.213
Something or someone moved
him into secondary position.

10:49.756 --> 10:53.051
Flip-flop usually means somebody
can't decide to call 911 ...

10:53.051 --> 10:54.427
or skip town.

11:05.813 --> 11:09.108
I'm going to need to swab
under your fingernails.

11:10.151 --> 11:11.194
Sure.

11:11.903 --> 11:12.946
How come?

11:15.615 --> 11:17.700
It's just part of
the investigation.

11:22.121 --> 11:23.748
Am I a suspect?

11:25.833 --> 11:26.918
A witness.

11:27.252 --> 11:29.921
You're looking for Chuck's skin
under my fingernails, aren't you?

11:29.921 --> 11:32.090
I try never to
have expectations.

11:32.090 --> 11:33.549
Never disappointed.

11:33.549 --> 11:35.176
Smart.

11:37.262 --> 11:38.930
I might as well tell you,

11:38.930 --> 11:41.641
things got a little rough
between Chuck and I ...

11:42.100 --> 11:43.101
sexually.

11:43.101 --> 11:45.728
You saw me notice those
scratches on your chest?

11:45.728 --> 11:47.605
He can get himself
worked up.

11:52.652 --> 11:54.279
I'm going to need to, uh,

11:54.279 --> 11:56.030
photograph those
markings, as well.

11:56.030 --> 11:57.073
Sure.

12:03.204 --> 12:04.372
This okay?

12:08.334 --> 12:09.502
Okay, um...

12:10.128 --> 12:12.130
sorry.
It happens.

12:30.398 --> 12:31.691
Hey, how's it look?

12:32.108 --> 12:34.360
Like a starry,
starry night.

12:34.360 --> 12:37.614
We've got rifle ammo,
some buckshot.

12:37.614 --> 12:39.115
Come on in,
take a look for yourself.

12:39.115 --> 12:42.243
No, I can't find another lead
apron, and Alexx isn't around.

12:42.243 --> 12:43.953
Well, then, by all means,
stay out.

12:46.039 --> 12:47.206
Calleigh,

12:47.206 --> 12:49.792
were you here at CSI when
Horatio's brother was killed?

12:49.792 --> 12:51.502
Ray?
Yeah, I was new.

12:51.502 --> 12:53.212
Keeping my head down.
Why do you ask?

12:53.212 --> 12:55.298
No reason, I just, uh ...

12:55.298 --> 12:57.300
I didn't realize his brother
worked narco.

12:57.300 --> 12:58.426
Yeah.

12:58.426 --> 13:01.304
Undercover narco cop gets
killed in the line of duty,

13:01.304 --> 13:03.097
might have been dirty,
something like that.

13:03.097 --> 13:04.432
I didn't say that.

13:04.432 --> 13:05.934
Nobody ever does.

13:06.267 --> 13:07.644
Was he dirty?

13:09.729 --> 13:10.980
I don't know.

13:12.023 --> 13:14.150
I don't know what
Raymond Caine was.

13:14.692 --> 13:17.195
I'm not entirely sure
Horatio does, either.

14:08.413 --> 14:09.581
Wow ...

14:09.581 --> 14:11.332
this tree has more
lead than wood.

14:11.332 --> 14:14.502
You got nines there,
.44s, .22s.

14:14.502 --> 14:17.088
There were over two hundred
expended projectiles ...

14:17.088 --> 14:18.131
that we couldn't see.

14:22.844 --> 14:24.304
So as the tree grew,

14:24.304 --> 14:26.472
the entrance holes
grew over with living cells.

14:27.348 --> 14:29.517
.30 carbine,
short rifle.

14:29.517 --> 14:31.644
760 by 39 also.

14:31.644 --> 14:32.478
A-K.

14:32.478 --> 14:35.940
This was not target practice;
this is training.

14:36.357 --> 14:38.443
This is training.
Nice going.

14:46.716 --> 14:48.218
You lied to me, Pete.

14:48.218 --> 14:50.261
I didn't know about
the bullets in the tree.

14:50.261 --> 14:52.805
The neighbors asked about
the noise while I was at work.

14:53.139 --> 14:54.766
Jeff just said
it was firecrackers.

14:54.766 --> 14:57.310
Then how do you explain the
weed I found in his room?

14:57.852 --> 14:59.062
I didn't know he
was into that.

14:59.062 --> 15:01.940
Let's ask your parole
officer what he thinks.

15:01.940 --> 15:03.066
Are you kidding me?

15:03.358 --> 15:04.526
All that ammo?

15:04.526 --> 15:07.111
Son's probably
training to knock off ...

15:07.111 --> 15:08.988
a chain of markets just
like his old man here.

15:09.656 --> 15:10.865
What happened?

15:11.199 --> 15:12.158
He borrowed your piece,

15:12.158 --> 15:14.661
and now you're a little worried
he may get nervous ...

15:14.661 --> 15:15.912
and drop it at a heist, huh?

15:17.997 --> 15:19.457
I don't have a piece.

15:19.457 --> 15:20.500
Right.

15:20.500 --> 15:23.461
You just got a hundred bullets
in your backyard tree.

15:23.461 --> 15:25.004
Plus, the weed.

15:25.004 --> 15:27.382
Unless you want to make
a case to the board ...

15:27.382 --> 15:30.093
that this contraband
is your son's,

15:30.093 --> 15:32.387
you're going
back inside,

15:32.387 --> 15:35.181
and you're going to serve out
the rest of your sentence.

15:35.932 --> 15:36.975
Which is it?

15:40.728 --> 15:42.355
The gun and the
weed are mine.

15:43.690 --> 15:44.858
Okay.

15:44.858 --> 15:46.526
So, he's all yours.

15:47.151 --> 15:48.236
Sold.

15:48.528 --> 15:51.656
729 days at stark.

15:51.656 --> 15:52.949
Let's go.

15:54.617 --> 15:55.743
My kid ...

15:56.703 --> 15:58.037
is still out there.

16:05.170 --> 16:06.713
Hi.
Hey.

16:06.713 --> 16:08.089
We brought
you some lunch,

16:08.089 --> 16:09.966
but somebody here
ate your fries.

16:09.966 --> 16:11.092
That's okay.

16:11.092 --> 16:13.011
So listen, Raymond,
I have to go get a file.

16:13.011 --> 16:14.679
I'll be right back.
Okay?

16:17.807 --> 16:18.892
How you doing?

16:19.225 --> 16:20.351
Good.
Good.

16:22.020 --> 16:23.688
She doesn't need a file.

16:23.688 --> 16:24.939
She wants you
to talk to me.

16:25.231 --> 16:26.065
That's right.

16:26.065 --> 16:27.483
She tells me ...

16:27.483 --> 16:29.277
that you've been getting
into fights at school.

16:33.907 --> 16:35.200
This kid in school ...

16:35.742 --> 16:37.619
...said my dad
was a bad cop.

16:39.078 --> 16:40.205
Well, you know what?

16:41.122 --> 16:42.415
That is not true.

16:42.832 --> 16:44.959
Your dad was a hero,

16:44.959 --> 16:48.505
but his job was to pretend
he was a bad cop.

16:49.589 --> 16:50.632
See the difference?

16:55.845 --> 16:57.514
He said I have
my dad's name.

16:57.514 --> 16:59.349
That's why I was bad.

17:00.391 --> 17:01.809
Let me tell you something.

17:02.143 --> 17:05.521
It's not important what
people say about us.

17:05.939 --> 17:07.607
It's only important ...

17:07.607 --> 17:11.778
what we know
inside about ourselves.

17:12.904 --> 17:14.113
Do you understand?

17:14.113 --> 17:15.323
Yeah.

17:15.323 --> 17:16.324
All right.

17:16.324 --> 17:18.867
So, no more fights
at school,

17:18.867 --> 17:19.993
because it upsets
your mother.

17:19.993 --> 17:20.787
All right.

17:20.787 --> 17:23.915
Good man.
Good man.

17:48.731 --> 17:49.774
Hello.

18:17.177 --> 18:18.511
I found the owner of
one of the guns ...

18:18.511 --> 18:21.347
that fired a bullet into
the Wilton family tree.

18:21.347 --> 18:22.932
Nick Gordon, age 45.

18:22.932 --> 18:24.017
Six months ago,

18:24.017 --> 18:26.019
the gun was used to
shoot out the scoreboard ...

18:26.019 --> 18:26.853
at Antioch High School.

18:26.853 --> 18:27.937
Antioch.

18:27.937 --> 18:29.522
That's where
Wilton's kid goes.

18:29.522 --> 18:31.065
So I called the principal,

18:31.065 --> 18:33.193
and found out that
Ben Gordon, age 17,

18:33.193 --> 18:35.278
was responsible for
shooting out the scoreboard.

18:35.278 --> 18:37.363
However, they believe that
another kid was with him,

18:37.363 --> 18:39.866
but because of the privacy laws,
they can't say anything.

18:39.866 --> 18:41.868
But the principal
did hesitate ...

18:41.868 --> 18:43.036
when I tried a
name on for size.

18:43.036 --> 18:44.078
Of course.

18:44.078 --> 18:45.246
Jeff Wilton.

18:45.538 --> 18:46.748
Our parolee's son.

18:46.748 --> 18:49.209
Okay, let's get Ben Gordon
and his father in here.

18:49.209 --> 18:50.251
You got it.

19:14.234 --> 19:15.318
Yeah?

19:15.652 --> 19:16.778
Yeah, it's Speed.

19:18.655 --> 19:20.740
All right, I'll be out
there in a minute.

19:28.873 --> 19:29.749
Hi.

19:29.749 --> 19:31.292
Thanks for coming out.

19:32.335 --> 19:33.503
You going somewhere?

19:34.337 --> 19:35.588
Actually, um ...

19:36.631 --> 19:38.508
there somewhere
else we can talk?

19:39.759 --> 19:42.053
I have a photo shoot
tomorrow in St. Thomas.

19:42.887 --> 19:44.305
You're a photographer?

19:44.848 --> 19:47.016
A model.
Bathing suits.

19:47.433 --> 19:49.185
It's probably why I was
so comfortable ...

19:49.185 --> 19:50.562
when you wanted
to take pictures of me.

19:51.563 --> 19:54.691
I realized later I might have
been a little too casual.

19:56.943 --> 19:58.611
So your boyfriend dies ...

19:58.611 --> 20:00.697
and you're able to
go to work the next day?

20:02.448 --> 20:04.159
Chuck and I weren't
married.

20:04.159 --> 20:05.743
I wasn't in his will.

20:05.743 --> 20:07.537
Yes, I need to make a living.

20:08.580 --> 20:10.582
Alison, did you
move the body?

20:10.582 --> 20:12.542
Is that what the
autopsy said?

20:15.670 --> 20:20.508
When I woke up, and he
didn't respond, yes,

20:20.508 --> 20:23.303
I rolled him over on
his back and called 911.

20:23.303 --> 20:26.181
Homicide has you
calling 911 at 7:00 am.

20:26.181 --> 20:28.308
Paramedics
show up at 7:08.

20:29.350 --> 20:33.271
It takes hours
for lividity to form.

20:33.897 --> 20:36.149
Really?
Really.

20:36.649 --> 20:39.819
I did roll him over in
the middle of the night.

20:40.445 --> 20:43.323
His arm was plopped
over my head and ...

20:43.323 --> 20:45.074
... I couldn't sleep.

20:46.117 --> 20:47.494
After I rolled him,

20:47.494 --> 20:50.622
I must have fallen
right back to sleep.

20:51.080 --> 20:53.416
So he was already dead
in the middle of the night.

20:53.416 --> 20:54.709
I suppose so.

20:55.251 --> 20:56.920
I read in Vanity Fair ...

20:56.920 --> 20:59.589
that time of death
could never be exact.

20:59.589 --> 21:01.382
It's all estimates.

21:01.674 --> 21:02.967
Within hours.

21:02.967 --> 21:04.260
No.

21:06.971 --> 21:08.515
You can't go on
your shoot.

21:09.974 --> 21:11.100
Tim ...

21:12.060 --> 21:14.187
would you let me
know what you find?

21:17.106 --> 21:18.483
I can't do that.

21:26.199 --> 21:29.327
Look, when it's, uh,
appropriate, okay?

21:32.580 --> 21:35.041
No, first class on that equipment's
as bad as business.

21:35.041 --> 21:36.334
Look into charters.

21:37.043 --> 21:37.961
Mr. Gordon.

21:37.961 --> 21:40.171
Look, I'm being pulled into
something; call me later.

21:40.171 --> 21:41.714
I thought you were supposed
to bring your son in.

21:41.714 --> 21:43.675
I did, he's out front,
having a smoke.

21:44.300 --> 21:46.052
I can't stop him;
he's right out there.

21:51.724 --> 21:54.185
Kid's been staring at dead
bodies for ten minutes.

21:54.185 --> 21:55.812
Naturals, traumas.

21:55.812 --> 21:58.565
My first year MEs would
have passed out by now.

21:58.565 --> 21:59.941
Says he's here
to see you.

21:59.941 --> 22:01.276
Okay, thank you.

22:01.818 --> 22:02.902
Ben.

22:03.611 --> 22:04.863
I'm Lieutenant Caine.

22:05.196 --> 22:07.156
Hey, you ever
kill anyone?

22:07.991 --> 22:10.201
Uh, in the line of duty.

22:10.618 --> 22:12.162
You want to put
that out, please?

22:14.164 --> 22:15.206
Thank you.

22:15.832 --> 22:17.500
It's an entrance
wound, right?

22:18.501 --> 22:20.295
It's small because ...

22:20.295 --> 22:23.006
the skin snaps back into place
once the bullet passes through.

22:23.965 --> 22:25.133
That's correct.

22:25.133 --> 22:26.384
You like guns.

22:26.384 --> 22:27.927
Yeah.
They're cool.

22:27.927 --> 22:30.096
Jeff Wilton thinks
guns are cool, too.

22:31.139 --> 22:33.558
Was Jeff with you when
you shot out the scoreboard?

22:35.226 --> 22:36.769
No, I did that alone.

22:37.937 --> 22:39.439
You ever go shooting
with Jeff?

22:39.439 --> 22:42.025
If I fired a gun, it wouldn't
be at a stupid tree.

22:42.025 --> 22:43.484
What would you shoot at?

22:43.902 --> 22:45.570
The kid who killed Jeff.

22:46.821 --> 22:48.323
So you know Jeff is dead?

22:50.408 --> 22:51.743
Ben?

22:52.785 --> 22:54.579
If he was alive,

22:54.579 --> 22:55.497
he would have
called me by now.

22:55.497 --> 22:56.581
You know what?

22:56.581 --> 22:58.666
Why don't you and your dad go
have lunch for a couple of hours...

22:58.666 --> 23:00.627
and then come back, all right?

23:01.044 --> 23:02.086
Go ahead.

23:16.100 --> 23:17.435
Heard you were
looking for me.

23:18.269 --> 23:19.604
Sleeping on the job?

23:20.647 --> 23:22.649
You a down man or
a feather man?

23:22.649 --> 23:24.067
They aren't
the same thing?

23:24.609 --> 23:27.612
Feathers are for flying;
down's for insulating.

23:27.612 --> 23:31.574
The more mature the down,
the better air-trapping ability.

23:31.574 --> 23:32.909
It's called "loft."

23:32.909 --> 23:35.912
That would explain the
scratches on Alison.

23:36.955 --> 23:38.414
Slow death.

23:41.543 --> 23:43.962
He had air between
those feathers.

23:43.962 --> 23:44.879
Down.

23:44.879 --> 23:46.631
Goose, to be exact.

23:47.382 --> 23:48.758
That's one scenario.

23:49.259 --> 23:50.009
What'd you get?

23:50.009 --> 23:53.763
Chuck Maxfield died one
day shy of his wedding.

23:53.763 --> 23:56.182
Alison never said anything
about them getting married.

23:56.182 --> 23:57.100
They weren't.

23:57.100 --> 23:58.726
That might've been the problem.

23:58.726 --> 24:00.645
Chuck was marrying a
girl from Coconut Grove.

24:00.645 --> 24:03.356
Reception was to have
been tonight at the Delano.

24:03.356 --> 24:04.607
Did you talk to the bride?

24:04.607 --> 24:05.608
Mother.

24:05.608 --> 24:07.151
The girl was too
broken up to talk,

24:07.151 --> 24:09.487
especially when she
found out where the guy died.

24:09.487 --> 24:10.655
They knew Alison?

24:10.655 --> 24:11.781
Never heard of her.

24:12.407 --> 24:14.534
She was his little secret.

24:14.951 --> 24:17.412
You know what we call that
over at robbery homicide.

24:17.412 --> 24:19.622
Yep, motive.

24:20.123 --> 24:22.375
H, I processed the
sneaker from Jeff's locker.

24:22.375 --> 24:23.585
Found soil in the tread.

24:23.585 --> 24:24.377
And?

24:24.377 --> 24:25.587
Soil's humus,

24:25.587 --> 24:28.214
high organic content,
very low mineral content,

24:28.214 --> 24:30.425
with one significant
man-made material,

24:30.425 --> 24:32.427
an epoxy called mastico.

24:32.427 --> 24:33.845
"Mastico"?
What's it used for?

24:33.845 --> 24:35.138
Repairing headstones.

24:35.138 --> 24:36.055
Headstones?

24:36.055 --> 24:37.599
Jeff's friend Ben.

24:37.599 --> 24:39.309
There's a recurring theme.

24:39.309 --> 24:41.644
I'm thinking
Redeemer Cemetery.

24:41.644 --> 24:43.104
It's the oldest one
in the county.

24:43.104 --> 24:45.815
Yes, and within walking
distance of the high school.

24:49.903 --> 24:52.864
Looks like the last person
buried here was 1968.

24:52.864 --> 24:54.741
First was 1860.

24:59.078 --> 25:01.664
Something wasn't
buried here very recently.

25:01.664 --> 25:02.457
Decomp?

25:02.457 --> 25:03.625
Yeah.

25:03.625 --> 25:05.710
It's stronger from over here.

25:10.757 --> 25:11.591
Here you go.

25:14.719 --> 25:15.720
Here you go.

25:19.182 --> 25:20.183
Now ...

25:20.475 --> 25:24.103
maggots will go to a wound.

25:25.146 --> 25:27.357
We have an exit wound, head.

25:27.357 --> 25:30.485
Sweet going in,
and ugly going out.

25:34.531 --> 25:36.449
Got another one
here in the back.

25:37.492 --> 25:38.993
This is an entry wound.

25:38.993 --> 25:40.370
Looks like an ambush.

25:41.079 --> 25:43.373
So much for me saying
he was in the keys.

25:43.373 --> 25:44.499
You know what?

25:44.499 --> 25:47.001
Maybe he was, because
this body was moved.

25:48.253 --> 25:51.381
You see, we got no
blood spatter anywhere ...

25:53.842 --> 25:55.260
but we do have ...

25:55.260 --> 25:57.262
gravitational blood
droplets on his clothes.

25:57.262 --> 25:58.596
So he was moved.

25:58.596 --> 26:00.098
Laid out like a
Christmas package.

26:00.098 --> 26:03.643
Well, I'll pay a visit to
our parolee Pete Wilton,

26:03.643 --> 26:04.894
let him know we
found his son.

26:06.729 --> 26:08.356
I would hold off on that.

26:09.899 --> 26:11.276
This is not his kid.

26:17.739 --> 26:19.949
Boy's I.D. Says,
"Mark Hubbard."

26:19.949 --> 26:21.951
Born in 1986.

26:21.951 --> 26:24.913
Found his library card
from Antioch High,

26:24.913 --> 26:26.790
and, yes,
he was moved.

26:27.248 --> 26:28.958
I'll find you for
the post.

26:28.958 --> 26:32.087
Particular attention to
the fingernails, please.

26:32.087 --> 26:34.881
If there's an epithelial,
I'll dig it out.

26:37.842 --> 26:38.885
Calleigh,

26:39.427 --> 26:41.012
check out what
I found in here.

26:47.602 --> 26:49.104
The real damage
is over here.

26:50.146 --> 26:51.189
Watch your step.

26:56.611 --> 26:58.697
High-velocity spatter,

27:00.532 --> 27:02.325
100-feet-plus per second ...

27:02.742 --> 27:04.077
it's consistent with a gunshot.

27:07.205 --> 27:08.498
A shot in the back, right?

27:08.498 --> 27:11.626
Well, after his head's hit,
he didn't go anywhere, so ...

27:12.669 --> 27:15.630
trajectory suggests
that he was bent over.

27:15.630 --> 27:17.298
Mist is waist high.

27:21.970 --> 27:24.264
And there's the projectile.
I'm going to take that with me.

27:27.308 --> 27:29.227
Bat bag, crumpled.

27:29.644 --> 27:32.313
Maybe that's why he was
bent over, reaching for it.

27:33.231 --> 27:35.483
Bat bag, scoreboard ...

27:35.900 --> 27:37.235
maybe there's
a theme here.

27:37.235 --> 27:40.030
Well, blood pool is here,
so he was bleeding out.

27:45.035 --> 27:47.245
There's a second hit on
the wall over here.

27:47.871 --> 27:51.333
Which means he managed
to make his way over,

27:51.624 --> 27:53.418
and dropped to his knees.

27:55.503 --> 27:57.130
And was shot a
second time.

27:59.924 --> 28:02.010
The suspect dragged
him from here ...

28:02.510 --> 28:04.346
to the cemetery.

28:06.431 --> 28:08.058
There was a
third person here.

28:09.601 --> 28:11.311
Yeah, there's a
void in the blood.

28:11.728 --> 28:13.021
Which also means ...

28:13.021 --> 28:16.149
that there was someone
behind the victim.

28:20.070 --> 28:21.404
Question is,

28:21.404 --> 28:23.156
the third guy was
helping or hindering?

28:33.249 --> 28:34.709
I've got a cigarette ...

28:35.335 --> 28:36.795
that might help us.

29:14.666 --> 29:15.709
Death mask.

29:25.093 --> 29:26.636
What's a death mask?

29:32.767 --> 29:34.310
That's Chuck's saliva.

29:34.853 --> 29:36.229
DNA confirmed it.

29:36.229 --> 29:37.188
And?

29:37.188 --> 29:39.566
Did you press his face
into the pillow,

29:39.566 --> 29:41.568
causing him to suffocate?

29:43.653 --> 29:45.113
Yes and no.

29:46.573 --> 29:49.117
Alison ...
You're so sure I'm guilty.

29:49.743 --> 29:51.828
I could see it when you
walked through the door.

29:51.828 --> 29:53.496
You have an explanation?

29:54.956 --> 29:56.041
Yes ...

29:56.583 --> 29:59.169
I pressed his face
into the pillow.

29:59.169 --> 30:00.378
No ...

30:00.795 --> 30:02.922
I did not suffocate him.

30:03.965 --> 30:05.508
He did, however ...

30:06.968 --> 30:08.428
orgasm.

30:12.349 --> 30:13.558
Excuse me?

30:13.558 --> 30:16.811
My marathon-running
boyfriend was a pillow biter.

30:17.729 --> 30:19.272
Satisfied?

30:20.315 --> 30:22.567
He liked to give
himself over to me.

30:23.068 --> 30:27.155
I, uh, could be
more explicit, but ...

30:27.155 --> 30:28.531
I get it.

30:29.574 --> 30:31.201
We role-played around ...

30:32.661 --> 30:34.245
two in the morning.

30:35.830 --> 30:37.457
Then we drank
some more wine.

30:39.542 --> 30:41.127
We snuggled.

30:44.839 --> 30:45.799
You okay?

30:45.799 --> 30:46.633
Yeah.

30:46.633 --> 30:47.759
Um ...

30:48.301 --> 30:51.721
it's just that this job,
it's weird uh, sometimes.

30:51.721 --> 30:54.849
You know, you learn
certain things about people.

30:59.604 --> 31:01.231
Hey.
Hey.

31:02.399 --> 31:04.943
You're interrogating our
witness without me?

31:04.943 --> 31:07.529
No, I was just running
a few questions by her.

31:10.407 --> 31:12.951
You interview her again,
I better be there.

31:12.951 --> 31:13.785
It's protocol.

31:13.785 --> 31:14.953
You will be there.

31:14.953 --> 31:16.079
You got that?

32:20.977 --> 32:22.062
Lieutenant?
Yeah?

32:22.062 --> 32:23.229
Results on those
cigarette butts.

32:23.229 --> 32:24.564
Three separate donors.

32:24.564 --> 32:26.900
One matched the sample
you gave me from Ben Gordon.

32:27.233 --> 32:28.526
Okay.
Thank you.

32:28.526 --> 32:29.652
All right.

32:29.652 --> 32:31.821
There were weapons
in this bag.

32:31.821 --> 32:33.365
Plural.
Rifles.

32:33.365 --> 32:35.825
You don't use a bat bag
just to carry handguns.

32:36.117 --> 32:37.243
No, you don't.

32:37.786 --> 32:41.331
Your son is in a
great deal of trouble.

32:43.750 --> 32:46.503
He told me he was
hanging out with Jeff Wilton.

32:46.503 --> 32:48.963
He admitted they
were shooting guns ...

32:48.963 --> 32:51.049
at Jeff's house,
at the school.

32:51.049 --> 32:53.510
Did he tell you that
he was at the cemetery ...

32:53.510 --> 32:55.595
the morning that
Mark Hubbard was killed?

32:55.595 --> 32:57.972
He told me they go
there in the mornings,

32:57.972 --> 33:00.058
before school,
for horseplay.

33:00.058 --> 33:02.811
I have a blood pattern,
my friend,

33:02.811 --> 33:05.230
that says there were two
people at the cemetery ...

33:05.230 --> 33:06.981
when Mark was
shot to death.

33:06.981 --> 33:10.443
So, are you the shooter,
or was Jeff?

33:11.820 --> 33:14.364
I'm not saying
anything about Jeff.

33:14.698 --> 33:15.699
Okay.

33:15.699 --> 33:17.826
Where are the guns?
What guns?

33:17.826 --> 33:23.164
They carried their rifles in a
bag and foolishly left it behind.

33:24.332 --> 33:25.375
Right?

33:30.588 --> 33:31.715
Hey.

33:33.508 --> 33:34.551
I can wait.

33:50.233 --> 33:52.652
We found this on the
handle of the bat bag.

33:52.652 --> 33:55.196
It's the same as the
t-shirt from Jeff's house.

33:55.196 --> 33:56.406
Okay, thank you.

33:57.365 --> 33:59.242
"The Four-Twenty Boyz."

33:59.242 --> 34:01.911
You, Jeff, and Mark, part of
the Four-Twenty Boyz, Ben?

34:01.911 --> 34:04.456
Is that what time you guys
used to get high every day?

34:05.290 --> 34:06.166
No.

34:06.166 --> 34:06.958
No?

34:08.001 --> 34:10.045
It's not a time;
it's a date.

34:10.045 --> 34:11.670
April 20 ...

34:11.670 --> 34:12.797
is what?

34:13.340 --> 34:14.966
Hitler's birthday,

34:15.592 --> 34:17.217
all around the world,
the whole week.

34:17.217 --> 34:20.221
So we have Waco,
the federal building,

34:20.221 --> 34:23.350
Columbine,
and now Antioch.

34:24.476 --> 34:28.146
So you guys were planning
an action, weren't you?

34:28.897 --> 34:30.106
No.

34:30.482 --> 34:31.858
Me and Mark backed out.

34:31.858 --> 34:33.610
Is that why Jeff shot Mark?

34:34.110 --> 34:36.154
I said I'm not going
through with this.

34:36.154 --> 34:36.946
Tough.

34:36.946 --> 34:37.947
No take-backs.

34:37.947 --> 34:39.114
Forget it, Jeff.

34:39.114 --> 34:40.742
We're getting rid of the guns.

34:41.242 --> 34:44.161
We're going to break these
down, bury them somewhere.

34:46.456 --> 34:47.540
I'm warning you.

34:48.792 --> 34:50.877
Jeff told me if I
said anything ...

34:54.797 --> 34:56.882
You talk, you die.

34:58.968 --> 35:02.055
Where is Jeff right now?
At the mausoleum.

35:02.055 --> 35:04.265
He's not at the mausoleum.
Where is he?

35:06.643 --> 35:09.604
Why don't you tell me what
time you were due out of school?

35:10.021 --> 35:11.606
3:00.

35:12.649 --> 35:15.402
But there's an assembly
today after class.

35:16.444 --> 35:17.696
At 4:20.

35:17.696 --> 35:20.615
He's going to start shooting.
Today.

35:35.779 --> 35:36.488
Lieutenant Caine.

35:36.488 --> 35:37.823
Bill Roland,
I'm the principal.

35:37.823 --> 35:39.699
Okay, Bill, SWAT
team is on the way.

35:39.699 --> 35:41.576
Any sign of Jeff Wilton?
None.

35:41.576 --> 35:43.412
He could have slipped into the
assembly with the other students.

35:43.412 --> 35:44.913
Okay, I'm going to
need everybody out ...

35:44.913 --> 35:45.705
of the building
right now.

35:45.705 --> 35:47.499
I don't want
to create a panic.

35:48.542 --> 35:49.584
Something just did, Bill.

35:49.584 --> 35:50.627
Everybody out.

35:50.627 --> 35:51.628
Everybody out, Bill!

35:51.628 --> 35:54.131
I need everybody to leave
the building right now!

35:54.423 --> 35:55.549
Right now!

36:19.865 --> 36:20.949
Hey, Jeff.

36:23.660 --> 36:24.995
Let's put the
weapon down ...

36:24.995 --> 36:26.538
and not make it
any worse, okay?

36:27.330 --> 36:29.040
You have no idea
what I've done.

36:29.040 --> 36:31.460
That's not true, Jeff.
I know about the cemetery.

36:31.460 --> 36:33.003
And I know about Mark.

36:33.003 --> 36:37.007
Jeff, you can put a stop to
this right now if you want to.

36:37.107 --> 36:39.901
You're right.
I can stop.

36:39.901 --> 36:41.695
I want you to think
about your dad.

36:41.695 --> 36:42.779
My dad didn't
care about me.

36:42.779 --> 36:45.991
That's not true.
That is not true, Jeff.

36:45.991 --> 36:47.826
He's back in jail for you.
Lies.

36:47.826 --> 36:49.536
No, no.

36:49.536 --> 36:50.579
He took the gun rap.

36:50.579 --> 36:53.915
Two more years inside for you.

36:58.587 --> 36:59.588
He really went back in?

36:59.588 --> 37:01.256
He did, Jeff.
Listen to me now,

37:01.256 --> 37:04.551
he came to me,
and he asked me to find you.

37:04.551 --> 37:06.720
That's the truth, Jeff.

37:11.808 --> 37:13.351
Tell him I said thanks.

37:13.351 --> 37:14.394
Jeff.

37:15.020 --> 37:16.062
Jeff!

37:21.735 --> 37:23.487
Jeff, don't move.

37:24.321 --> 37:25.447
Do not move.

37:34.414 --> 37:35.665
I could have killed you.

37:35.665 --> 37:38.126
Yeah, but you didn't.

37:39.169 --> 37:40.253
We're clear.

37:42.339 --> 37:44.424
You're lucky
no one died here, kid.

37:48.053 --> 37:49.971
Tox is in.
You interested?

37:52.140 --> 37:53.308
Ethanol.

37:54.351 --> 37:55.519
Alcohol.

37:56.561 --> 37:59.231
Boyfriend was three
times the legal limit.

37:59.231 --> 38:00.524
My guess is vodka.

38:00.524 --> 38:01.650
No smell.

38:01.650 --> 38:03.443
Would that amount, um,

38:03.443 --> 38:05.487
impede his sexual
performance?

38:05.487 --> 38:07.489
Oh, honey,
that amount of alcohol ...

38:07.489 --> 38:09.866
would impede an elephant's
sexual performance.

38:11.952 --> 38:13.370
Catch her in a lie?

38:14.204 --> 38:16.289
I have to take a
look at the evidence.

39:31.990 --> 39:33.200
Hi.

39:34.242 --> 39:36.953
The guy was passed
out on his back.

39:40.165 --> 39:41.625
You took a pillow ...

39:43.710 --> 39:45.378
you put it over his mouth ...

39:52.844 --> 39:54.930
... you pressed down
as hard as you could,

39:55.263 --> 39:57.098
with these little hands ...

39:57.516 --> 39:58.975
and this little charm.

40:09.861 --> 40:12.280
Probably for about
five or six minutes.

40:12.280 --> 40:16.034
Would have taken less
time with an inferior fill, but ...

40:17.077 --> 40:18.745
only the best
for you, right?

40:19.704 --> 40:21.540
I was glad when
you called.

40:22.916 --> 40:24.417
It's crazy, huh?

40:24.835 --> 40:26.086
I mean, I knew ...

40:27.963 --> 40:30.882
but still, I was glad.

40:34.469 --> 40:36.471
You've been playing
me since day one.

40:37.305 --> 40:38.849
If you believed that ...

40:39.558 --> 40:41.685
your partner would be
here right now.

40:43.270 --> 40:45.021
I didn't think you heard us.

40:47.107 --> 40:49.776
People get smothered
by pillows ...

40:51.653 --> 40:53.280
accidentally.

40:55.699 --> 40:57.784
Yeah, but Chuck
wasn't one of them.

41:01.830 --> 41:03.915
You should have
let the guy get married.

41:29.107 --> 41:30.484
He was watching ...

41:31.526 --> 41:33.153
from behind the mirror.

41:33.153 --> 41:34.821
Just like the last time.

41:36.281 --> 41:40.035
I don't conduct interviews
without my detective, ever.

41:44.539 --> 41:46.416
It's time to
stand up, Alison.

41:50.170 --> 41:53.298
You're under arrest for the
murder of Charles Maxfield.

41:55.675 --> 41:57.552
Can't believe you
did this to me.

42:01.598 --> 42:02.849
Yes, you can.

42:39.135 --> 42:40.554
It's a sorry state.

42:41.513 --> 42:43.431
I'm just grateful to
Lieutenant Caine ...

42:43.849 --> 42:46.434
that only one
person was killed.

42:49.312 --> 42:50.814
I'm sorry I let you down, dad.

42:50.814 --> 42:51.940
No.

42:52.274 --> 42:53.859
No, I let you down.

42:55.110 --> 42:56.611
But you killed someone,

42:57.445 --> 42:59.239
and you're going
to have to pay for that ...

42:59.865 --> 43:01.366
the rest of your life.

43:01.658 --> 43:03.577
I want you to think
about that ...

43:03.994 --> 43:05.245
hard.

43:06.288 --> 43:08.456
Every day they keep
you inside.

43:10.125 --> 43:11.668
'Cause when you
do get out,

43:13.003 --> 43:15.338
you're only going
to get one more chance.

43:16.381 --> 43:20.552
And we're not going to see
each other for a long, long time.

43:22.304 --> 43:23.805
What's going to
happen now?

43:24.848 --> 43:26.308
That is up to you.

43:43.950 --> 43:45.410
You think he heard me?

43:46.453 --> 43:47.704
I'll let you know.
