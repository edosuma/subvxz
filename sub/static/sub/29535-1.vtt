00:19.962 --> 00:21.898
Call me Ishmael.

00:24.935 --> 00:29.369
Whenever it is a dark,
drizzly November in my soul,

00:29.371 --> 00:32.473
and it requires
a strong moral principle

00:32.475 --> 00:35.375
to prevent me from
stepping into the streets

00:35.377 --> 00:38.680
and methodically knocking
people's hats off,

00:38.682 --> 00:44.351
I account it high time
to get to sea as soon as I can.

00:44.353 --> 00:48.155
Wherefore it is
I should take it into my head

00:48.157 --> 00:50.524
to go on a whaling voyage,

00:50.526 --> 00:54.128
doubtless it forms part of
the grand program of Providence

00:54.130 --> 00:56.664
that was drawn up
a long time ago.

00:56.666 --> 01:00.969
They came to see me?
I am Ahab!

01:00.971 --> 01:02.202
[audience murmuring]

01:02.204 --> 01:04.471
[woman yelling]

01:04.474 --> 01:09.710
Chief among my motives
is the great whale himself.

01:09.712 --> 01:12.747
Such a portentous
and mysterious monster

01:12.749 --> 01:17.587
rouses all my curiosity
and sways me to my wish.

01:20.190 --> 01:24.525
I stuffed a shirt or two
into my old carpetbag,

01:24.527 --> 01:29.333
tuck it under my arm
and start for Nantucket.

01:31.368 --> 01:33.470
[waves crashing]

02:16.279 --> 02:17.079
[latch opens]

02:19.049 --> 02:22.116
What? Who are you?
No, no, no, stop!

02:22.118 --> 02:25.322
Please, please, no, let me...
Who are you?

02:26.823 --> 02:28.755
What is happening?
What's happening? No!

02:28.757 --> 02:31.759
- Please, stop, stop!
- Mother.

02:31.761 --> 02:33.194
- Let me go!
- Mother!

02:33.196 --> 02:35.595
Let me go! Rebecca!

02:35.597 --> 02:36.763
- Rebecca!
- Mother!

02:36.765 --> 02:40.368
Tobias, what is happening?

02:40.370 --> 02:42.136
- Her coat.
- Mother!

02:42.138 --> 02:43.604
- Rebecca!
- Mother.

02:43.606 --> 02:45.706
- Rebecca!
- Rebecca! Rebecca, please!

02:45.708 --> 02:47.340
It's time for bed.

02:47.342 --> 02:48.277
Rebecca!

02:53.750 --> 02:55.516
Wait, what is happening?

02:55.518 --> 02:58.386
What's happening?
Let me go!

02:58.388 --> 03:00.354
- [grunting]
- [horse neighs]

03:00.356 --> 03:02.823
Please! Please stop!

03:02.825 --> 03:04.424
I have a daughter!

03:04.426 --> 03:06.295
Stop!

03:07.830 --> 03:10.333
[distant yelling]

03:19.575 --> 03:21.277
Put it on.

03:22.478 --> 03:23.813
Now!

03:28.751 --> 03:31.518
In the bed.

03:31.520 --> 03:32.455
Come!

03:42.698 --> 03:45.333
[door closes, locks]

03:45.335 --> 03:47.834
It is a dismal night.

03:47.836 --> 03:49.436
Bitingly cold.

03:49.438 --> 03:53.507
I know no one in the place.

03:53.509 --> 03:56.710
Not far from the docks,
I come upon an out-hanging light

03:56.712 --> 03:59.714
and a sign over a door.

03:59.716 --> 04:01.481
Good evening.

04:01.483 --> 04:03.650
Do you perchance have a room
available for the night?

04:03.652 --> 04:07.255
Alas, my house is full.
Not a bed unoccupied.

04:07.257 --> 04:09.256
But you ain't got
no objections

04:09.258 --> 04:12.160
to sharing a harpooner's
blanket, have ye?

04:12.162 --> 04:14.327
I suppose
you are going a-whaling,

04:14.329 --> 04:17.398
so you'd better get used
to that sort of thing.

04:17.399 --> 04:19.466
I never like to sleep
two in a bed,

04:19.468 --> 04:23.470
but rather than wander about a
strange town on so bitter night,

04:23.472 --> 04:26.607
I reckon I'll put up with half
of any decent man's blanket.

04:26.609 --> 04:28.843
Come on, I'll show ya
to your room.

04:28.845 --> 04:31.444
He'll be here afore long.

04:31.446 --> 04:34.614
He's a decent enough chap
and pays regular.

04:34.616 --> 04:36.652
Make yourself comfortable.

04:40.590 --> 04:42.226
Good night to ye.

04:49.364 --> 04:50.800
WOMAN: Good morning,
Mrs. Wallace.

04:53.236 --> 04:54.768
I am Miss Stokes,
the head matron.

04:54.770 --> 04:58.239
Please. I have a daughter.

04:58.241 --> 05:00.307
She's 8 years old.

05:00.309 --> 05:01.576
[sighs]

05:01.578 --> 05:03.843
- You are sick.
- No, I'm not sick.

05:03.845 --> 05:07.215
I'm not sick, I'm not sick.
Please let me talk to a doctor.

05:07.217 --> 05:09.686
You need to stop
the dramatics.

05:11.453 --> 05:13.920
This institution respects
obedient women

05:13.922 --> 05:16.924
who participate in treatment.

05:16.926 --> 05:18.729
Those are the women
who have daughters.

05:24.734 --> 05:27.867
You've made a mess
of your breakfast.

05:27.869 --> 05:29.872
You'll have to go hungry.

05:35.011 --> 05:36.677
Cheer up.

05:36.679 --> 05:38.849
This is a place of healing.

05:42.986 --> 05:44.855
- [neighs]
- Whoa!

05:50.792 --> 05:52.693
Thank you, Clyde.

05:52.695 --> 05:56.564
You have a pleasant day
at the madhouse, Doctor.

05:56.566 --> 05:58.365
How many times
must I tell you, Clyde?

05:58.367 --> 06:00.836
We must call it hospital.

06:07.977 --> 06:09.410
[squealing]

06:09.412 --> 06:11.315
[laughter]

06:12.849 --> 06:16.320
[groaning]

06:17.919 --> 06:21.290
[yelling]

06:23.525 --> 06:24.792
[laughter]

06:24.794 --> 06:28.832
[chatter]

06:40.342 --> 06:42.511
Welcome to the snake pit.

06:44.446 --> 06:46.379
I don't belong here.

06:46.381 --> 06:47.982
Neither do I, dearie.

06:47.984 --> 06:52.485
I'm old and an inconvenience,

06:52.487 --> 06:54.021
but I ain't mad.

06:54.023 --> 06:55.422
GIRL: Yeah, let's do it!

06:55.424 --> 06:57.391
Fuck! Shit!

06:57.393 --> 06:58.725
Shut your filthy mouth!

06:58.727 --> 07:00.860
GIRL: Fuck!

07:00.862 --> 07:02.798
[muffled screaming]

07:05.068 --> 07:08.038
[muffled screaming continues]

07:09.405 --> 07:11.806
- The board is waiting.
- Yes.

07:11.808 --> 07:14.542
- How do I look?
- Marvelous.

07:14.544 --> 07:16.444
- Is the chairman there?
- Of course he is.

07:16.446 --> 07:18.679
Do you remember your speech?

07:18.681 --> 07:22.115
Uh, <i>Moby Dick...</i>

07:22.117 --> 07:26.953
Melvin's masterwork
of obsession...

07:26.955 --> 07:30.958
- Madness.
- And madness upon the sea.

07:30.960 --> 07:32.992
It is this story, gentleman...

07:32.994 --> 07:36.564
that I propose
to bring to life here,

07:36.566 --> 07:39.833
with our patients
playing the roles.

07:39.835 --> 07:41.936
[laughs]

07:41.938 --> 07:44.672
A play?

07:44.674 --> 07:46.907
A theatrical production?

07:46.909 --> 07:50.610
A technique pioneered by
Dr. Jacoby at Doublehill.

07:50.612 --> 07:53.449
And used with great success.

08:01.590 --> 08:05.059
The theater provides
a means of self-explanation

08:05.061 --> 08:06.860
and self-knowledge.

08:06.862 --> 08:08.996
Is that not what we strive
to provide for our patients?

08:08.998 --> 08:10.965
Preposterous.

08:10.967 --> 08:13.434
We are here to treat
these poor souls,

08:13.436 --> 08:16.069
not to set them prancing
about like chimpanzees.

08:16.071 --> 08:19.006
Oars and harpoons
in the hands of lunatics.

08:19.008 --> 08:20.607
Insane.

08:20.609 --> 08:24.044
We'll give them prop weapons,
of course.

08:24.046 --> 08:27.480
Dr. Calhoun,
I agreed to employ you here

08:27.482 --> 08:29.617
as a favor to your father,
who assured me

08:29.619 --> 08:33.453
that your perverse fascination
with the theater was behind you.

08:33.455 --> 08:37.525
Yet you sit here before us
asking to put on a play.

08:37.527 --> 08:38.957
Therapy!

08:38.960 --> 08:44.030
I confess my love
for the theater is unabated,

08:44.032 --> 08:48.169
but I come to you now
as a man of medicine.

08:48.171 --> 08:51.742
My only concern is
the welfare of my patients.

08:54.176 --> 08:56.075
I realize I am new here.

08:56.077 --> 08:58.878
But I've been around
long enough to recognize

08:58.880 --> 09:00.046
that the old methods...

09:00.048 --> 09:03.851
isolation, ice-therapy,
leeches...

09:03.853 --> 09:06.690
they do not work.

09:08.056 --> 09:10.623
Well...

09:10.625 --> 09:12.793
we could try it
on the female inmates.

09:12.795 --> 09:15.161
They may be more docile.

09:15.163 --> 09:16.866
Women?

09:19.569 --> 09:24.505
Gentleman, all of the roles
in <i>Moby Dick</i> are for men.

09:24.507 --> 09:26.643
Who gives a damn?

09:28.744 --> 09:31.415
It's women or nothing.

09:37.854 --> 09:39.719
Benjamin?

09:39.721 --> 09:41.056
Hmm.

09:48.598 --> 09:52.165
I think a play is a fine idea.

09:52.167 --> 09:54.638
They mean to discourage you.

09:56.705 --> 09:58.140
They shan't.

10:00.176 --> 10:02.512
Let's begin casting.

10:03.646 --> 10:07.780
BENJAMIN: Ah, Bernadette!

10:07.782 --> 10:10.251
Bernadette, take your time

10:10.253 --> 10:13.286
and then whenever
you're ready, begin.

10:13.288 --> 10:15.723
BERNADETTE: Call me Ishmael.
Whenever it is a damp, drizzly November...

10:15.725 --> 10:17.190
BENJAMIN:
Wonderful, Bernadette!

10:17.192 --> 10:18.627
Thank you.

10:21.596 --> 10:23.930
BENJAMIN: Ah, Freda, yes!

10:23.932 --> 10:25.900
Take your time, okay?

10:25.902 --> 10:27.237
FREDA: Call me...

10:28.870 --> 10:30.603
Ishmael.

10:30.605 --> 10:32.705
I can't read.

10:32.707 --> 10:35.608
[shrieking]

10:35.610 --> 10:37.944
- [gasping]
- [shrieking continues]

10:37.946 --> 10:39.280
Kara!

10:39.282 --> 10:41.017
Kara, Kara.

10:42.084 --> 10:43.617
BENJAMIN: Wait!

10:43.619 --> 10:46.920
Be gentle with her!
Be gentle!

10:46.922 --> 10:49.622
Easy.

10:49.624 --> 10:51.695
Come here. Let me see it.

10:52.928 --> 10:54.797
I just want to see it.

10:55.797 --> 10:58.598
[women screaming]

10:58.600 --> 11:00.035
[crying]

11:03.004 --> 11:05.274
PHOEBE: Maybe we should
take a break.

11:08.311 --> 11:11.111
Perhaps she could be
our Queequeg?

11:11.113 --> 11:13.280
I don't know.
Queequeg is called a savage,

11:13.282 --> 11:14.915
but he's really
one of the more intelligent...

11:14.917 --> 11:16.650
Trust me on this, Matron.

11:16.652 --> 11:19.920
I'm sorry.
I don't think I know you.

11:19.922 --> 11:21.557
Yes, you.

11:24.627 --> 11:26.096
Do you read?

11:29.764 --> 11:32.732
Call me Ishmael.

11:32.734 --> 11:36.203
Whenever it is a damp,
drizzly November in my soul,

11:36.205 --> 11:38.905
and it requires a strong
moral principle

11:38.907 --> 11:41.742
to prevent me from
stepping into the street

11:41.744 --> 11:44.745
and methodically knocking
people's hats off,

11:44.747 --> 11:49.652
then I account it high time
to get to sea as soon as I can.

11:51.186 --> 11:53.319
You are new, Miss...

11:53.321 --> 11:56.857
Mrs. Wallace.
Isabel Wallace.

11:56.859 --> 12:02.396
She was committed last night
by her husband, a minister.

12:02.398 --> 12:06.165
Well, Mrs. Wallace,
I'm Dr. Benjamin Calhoun.

12:06.167 --> 12:07.269
Welcome.

12:08.671 --> 12:10.871
Isn't it exciting?

12:10.873 --> 12:14.107
I've always wanted
to be an actress.

12:14.109 --> 12:16.944
Is it always like this?

12:16.946 --> 12:19.913
We get a bit of sugar
on Sundays.

12:19.915 --> 12:21.318
Sometimes.

12:24.420 --> 12:26.386
Not hungry, Mrs. Wallace?

12:26.388 --> 12:28.722
Farm animals eat better.

12:28.724 --> 12:31.628
You should be thankful
you get anything at all.

12:32.861 --> 12:34.630
Thank you, Matron.

12:35.797 --> 12:38.033
Dr. Calhoun wants to see you.

12:40.036 --> 12:43.373
So I have some exciting news.

12:44.840 --> 12:48.078
I have cast you
in the role of Ishmael.

12:54.683 --> 12:57.284
Uh...

12:57.286 --> 12:59.285
Have you acted before?

12:59.287 --> 13:02.088
I lead the church choir.

13:02.090 --> 13:03.857
Well, splendid!

13:03.859 --> 13:07.160
Perhaps your experiences there
will aid us in...

13:07.162 --> 13:08.931
I'm not mad.

13:11.332 --> 13:13.367
Well, let's see.

13:13.369 --> 13:16.306
I have your file right here.

13:17.873 --> 13:19.707
"Isabel Wallace.

13:19.709 --> 13:22.476
committed at the request
of Reverend Tobias Wallace."

13:22.478 --> 13:25.011
No, Mrs. Wall...

13:25.013 --> 13:26.349
Good heavens.

13:28.017 --> 13:30.317
This is the work of my husband.

13:30.319 --> 13:33.957
He's an angry, wrathful man.

13:37.926 --> 13:40.426
Now there must be something
to prove my sanity.

13:40.428 --> 13:42.261
Some kind of test...

13:42.263 --> 13:45.833
You have been found insane,
committed by the authorities.

13:45.835 --> 13:48.202
What if I wrote letters?

13:48.204 --> 13:50.036
I have friends
at the Ladies' Society.

13:50.038 --> 13:53.306
- My church, who can intercede...
- Mrs. Wallace, it is very...

13:53.308 --> 13:55.141
I have a daughter.

13:55.143 --> 13:59.382
She is eight years old,
and she's alone <i>with him.</i>

14:06.254 --> 14:07.389
Please.

14:09.124 --> 14:11.293
There must be
something you can do.

14:18.768 --> 14:21.738
Yes. I will make inquiries.

14:25.040 --> 14:27.040
Don't think that you can
improve your situation

14:27.042 --> 14:30.544
by batting your eyes
at the doctors, Mrs. Wallace.

14:30.546 --> 14:33.012
You'll soon learn
who's really in charge.

14:33.014 --> 14:35.951
[straining]

14:39.053 --> 14:40.956
[splashing]

14:56.538 --> 14:59.405
Can I climb in with you?

14:59.407 --> 15:03.812
I'm so cold,
I can't even feel my own body.

15:24.032 --> 15:26.132
TOBIAS: Isabel.

15:26.134 --> 15:29.104
Come. Lie with me.

15:31.005 --> 15:33.208
I don't feel that well tonight.

15:37.312 --> 15:40.182
You will fulfill
your wifely duty.

16:07.075 --> 16:10.544
BENJAMIN: Okay, this is the part
where Ishmael meets Queequeg.

16:10.546 --> 16:13.947
There is a heavy footfall
in the passage.

16:13.949 --> 16:15.348
Holding a lantern,

16:15.350 --> 16:17.984
a tall dark figure
enters the room.

16:17.986 --> 16:21.454
Kara, you are Queequeg.

16:21.456 --> 16:24.156
That is your cue. Enter.

16:24.158 --> 16:27.059
Good. Uh...

16:27.061 --> 16:30.229
What a sight.
Such a face.

16:30.231 --> 16:32.299
Dark and tattooed in squares,

16:32.301 --> 16:34.367
his hair tied up
in a scalp-knot.

16:34.369 --> 16:36.002
We'll get your makeup later.

16:36.004 --> 16:38.438
A strange object
dangles from his hand.

16:38.440 --> 16:41.507
Matron, if you can get Kara
a prop please.

16:41.509 --> 16:43.510
Let's do that.

16:43.512 --> 16:46.346
It is a shrunken human head.

16:46.348 --> 16:48.115
Give it.

16:48.117 --> 16:52.019
Queequeg extinguishes the light
and springs into bed.

16:52.021 --> 16:54.655
You spring into bed.

16:54.657 --> 16:56.189
Oh! Ow!

16:56.191 --> 16:59.525
Okay, okay, Kara, Kara,
not so rough.

16:59.527 --> 17:01.461
You want to see who she is.

17:01.463 --> 17:03.963
- Very gentle.
- [Kara shrieks]

17:03.965 --> 17:06.333
Okay, okay, Kara?

17:06.335 --> 17:09.970
I want to show you
what I'm talking about.

17:09.972 --> 17:11.138
Get up.

17:12.339 --> 17:14.339
Thank you. Good, good.

17:14.342 --> 17:18.044
I'm going to grab this from you.
I'll give it back.

17:18.046 --> 17:21.483
All right, so to bed,
and I'm going...

17:23.718 --> 17:27.020
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

17:27.021 --> 17:29.289
I'm fine.

17:29.291 --> 17:31.290
Yes.

17:31.292 --> 17:33.026
Very well.

17:33.028 --> 17:35.695
Well, this is
make-believe, ladies.

17:35.697 --> 17:37.233
Okay, um...

17:38.500 --> 17:39.636
[clears throat]

17:43.071 --> 17:46.173
BENJAMIN:
Uh, who the devil are you?

17:46.175 --> 17:50.010
Speaketh! Tell me!

17:50.012 --> 17:51.278
Who are you?!

17:51.280 --> 17:56.249
Angel, save me! Landlord!

17:56.251 --> 17:59.319
You did not tell me
my bedmate was a savage.

17:59.321 --> 18:00.753
Huh!

18:00.755 --> 18:03.623
Queequeg wouldn't harm
a hair of your head.

18:03.625 --> 18:05.992
That's a shrunken head?

18:05.994 --> 18:09.495
He brought a lot of embalmed
heads from the South Seas.

18:09.497 --> 18:11.197
As curios, you know.

18:11.199 --> 18:13.032
- Queequeg!
- Yeah?

18:13.034 --> 18:16.136
This man sleepy.
[snores]

18:16.138 --> 18:18.371
You, you sabbee?

18:18.373 --> 18:21.607
Me sabbee plenty.

18:21.609 --> 18:23.577
You gettee in.

18:23.579 --> 18:26.115
Thank you, landlord.
You may go.

18:33.187 --> 18:37.357
Yes, uh, so at that moment,
uh...

18:37.359 --> 18:40.793
you will get into bed with Kara.

18:40.795 --> 18:43.195
Kara, get in bed.

18:43.197 --> 18:45.133
You will get in bed
next to Ishmael.

18:48.369 --> 18:51.038
Okay.

18:51.040 --> 18:55.274
Well, I think we're
making real progress.

18:55.276 --> 18:56.475
Oh, my God.

18:56.477 --> 19:00.549
Dr. Calhoun,
I can rehearse with her.

19:02.384 --> 19:04.320
That would be lovely.
Thank you, Isabel.

19:06.487 --> 19:08.621
ISABEL: They took
her beautiful clothes away

19:08.623 --> 19:11.290
and dressed her
in an old gray smock.

19:11.292 --> 19:13.592
Just look at
the proud princess now!

19:13.594 --> 19:16.663
- They laughed as they led her into the kitchen.
- [thud]

19:16.665 --> 19:19.732
Let's get to bed, okay?

19:19.734 --> 19:21.503
I'll read you some more
tomorrow.

19:24.639 --> 19:26.807
All right, darling, sleep well.

19:26.809 --> 19:29.076
Sweet dreams, okay?

19:29.078 --> 19:30.580
- I love you.
- Love you.

19:31.647 --> 19:33.512
Why is she awake?

19:33.514 --> 19:36.450
It's my fault.
I lost track of time.

19:36.452 --> 19:38.087
Let's get to bed.

19:40.388 --> 19:42.188
How are things proceeding
with Kara?

19:42.190 --> 19:43.824
- Quite well.
- Good.

19:43.826 --> 19:46.626
No! Don't do that!

19:46.628 --> 19:48.728
Aagh!
It's a feature of her condition.

19:48.730 --> 19:51.197
She devours all sorts
of awful things.

19:51.199 --> 19:52.699
Kara, look at your mouth.
You're a mess.

19:52.701 --> 19:54.800
Come on, sit, sit.

19:54.802 --> 19:57.604
Come. Come sit.

19:57.606 --> 20:00.343
Why don't we face
each other here?

20:03.145 --> 20:05.779
Are you ready to play the scene
for Dr. Calhoun?

20:05.781 --> 20:08.615
We'll play the scene
where we become friends.

20:08.617 --> 20:12.055
Were you shaving
with the harpoon?

20:14.889 --> 20:17.857
Queequeg is a comely looking
cannibal.

20:17.859 --> 20:21.560
I find myself
mysteriously drawn to him.

20:21.562 --> 20:25.499
I see a lofty bearing,
a simple honest heart,

20:25.501 --> 20:27.701
and in his dark eyes,

20:27.703 --> 20:30.606
a spirit that would dare
a thousand devils.

20:32.273 --> 20:36.342
Queequeg, what say you
to a social smoke?

20:36.344 --> 20:39.448
Oh, um, use my pipe.

20:40.849 --> 20:42.515
Here.

20:42.517 --> 20:44.216
We are now bosom friends

20:44.218 --> 20:47.255
and resolve to ship
aboard the same vessel.

20:51.493 --> 20:53.559
- [Kara grunts]
- Bravo!

20:53.561 --> 20:55.595
Quite good, quite good.

20:55.597 --> 20:57.196
- She's come so far.
- Mm-hmm.

20:57.198 --> 20:59.299
ISABEL: She's a really
sweet girl

20:59.301 --> 21:02.368
and eager to please once she
knows what's expected of her.

21:02.370 --> 21:04.937
Yes.
[chuckles]

21:04.939 --> 21:08.244
Well, Isabel, um...

21:09.778 --> 21:13.946
I was giving your situation
a great deal of thought,

21:13.948 --> 21:18.350
and if you pen a letter
to the Ladies' Society,

21:18.352 --> 21:21.221
I'll do my best
to see it delivered.

21:21.223 --> 21:24.159
Thank you.
Thank you, Dr. Calhoun.

21:25.359 --> 21:26.725
No! No!

21:26.727 --> 21:29.529
Kara, don't eat the goldfish!

21:29.531 --> 21:30.829
[gulps]

21:30.831 --> 21:33.835
[laughing]

21:37.872 --> 21:41.674
The anchor is up,
the sail is set,

21:41.676 --> 21:44.743
and the short northern day
merges into night,

21:44.745 --> 21:48.316
as we blindly plunge like fate
into the lone Atlantic.

21:49.551 --> 21:51.952
Our captain's name is Ahab.

21:51.954 --> 21:54.954
He's lost his leg to a whale
on his previous voyage.

21:54.956 --> 21:56.790
For several days,

21:56.792 --> 21:59.592
no sign has been seen of him
above hatches.

21:59.594 --> 22:01.661
He stays in his cabin.

22:01.663 --> 22:04.798
[whispering] Whosoever of ye
raises me a white-headed whale...

22:04.800 --> 22:08.171
Mary, louder, please.
I can barely hear you.

22:09.838 --> 22:11.905
A crooked jaw
and three holes!

22:11.907 --> 22:13.639
That's a bit too loud.

22:13.641 --> 22:15.674
Why don't we try
for a happy medium.

22:15.676 --> 22:17.577
[grunts]

22:17.579 --> 22:19.549
Mary, show some respect.

22:21.750 --> 22:26.519
- [women gasp]
- [Mary laughs]

22:26.521 --> 22:28.621
[gasping continues]

22:28.623 --> 22:30.522
[Mary screaming]

22:30.524 --> 22:33.260
I didn't know she'd do that.

22:33.262 --> 22:36.363
It's not your fault, Matron,
but I am beginning to despair.

22:36.365 --> 22:38.901
Without an Ahab,
we have no play.

22:44.572 --> 22:46.242
Well, there is
one other possibility.

22:57.551 --> 22:59.551
Why the devil
didn't you tell me?

22:59.553 --> 23:01.590
She's considered dangerous.

23:06.061 --> 23:09.529
I thought you said her last
incident was a year ago.

23:09.531 --> 23:11.865
Because she's been
in isolation since.

23:11.867 --> 23:14.470
She nearly bit off
a nurse's finger.

23:15.704 --> 23:17.840
Then we'll have to wear gloves.

23:21.310 --> 23:23.542
[whimpering]

23:23.544 --> 23:27.550
Miss Price, I'm Dr. Calhoun.

23:29.417 --> 23:32.921
I'm here to inform you
of a new therapy of my design.

23:34.923 --> 23:38.357
I saw you at Edward Fry's
Opera House.

23:38.359 --> 23:41.664
As Lady Macbeth,
you mesmerized me.

23:43.698 --> 23:46.031
We're doing a play.

23:46.033 --> 23:47.736
Melville's <i>Moby Dick.</i>

23:50.071 --> 23:52.806
I want you to be my Ahab.

23:52.808 --> 23:53.876
[thud]

23:58.013 --> 23:59.881
Goodbye, Miss Price.

24:05.020 --> 24:09.055
DR. WITHERS: Beatrice Price.
Have you lost all sense?

24:09.057 --> 24:12.358
We have her in isolation
for a reason.

24:12.360 --> 24:14.394
She is violent.

24:14.396 --> 24:15.828
Vicious!

24:15.830 --> 24:18.365
The misdeeds these women
committed in former lives

24:18.367 --> 24:20.466
ought not weigh
against them here.

24:20.468 --> 24:25.371
Beatrice Price is a murderess
and a sexual deviant.

24:25.373 --> 24:27.773
Allowing her access
to these women

24:27.775 --> 24:31.911
would be like loosing
a fox in a henhouse.

24:31.913 --> 24:33.913
I'll take full responsibility.

24:33.915 --> 24:37.453
I have no doubt
my therapy will aid her.

24:48.696 --> 24:50.733
Wait, wait, wait.

24:52.067 --> 24:54.701
Beatrice Price.

24:54.703 --> 24:55.870
PHOEBE: On stage, please.

24:58.807 --> 24:59.809
Act one, scene five.

25:05.513 --> 25:09.014
Miss Price, you are reading
for the role of Captain Ahab.

25:09.016 --> 25:10.817
I'll be holding your script.

25:10.819 --> 25:12.754
I don't need a damn script.

25:17.958 --> 25:21.594
On such a day,

25:21.596 --> 25:24.630
one as sweet as this,

25:24.632 --> 25:27.733
I struck my first whale.

25:27.735 --> 25:33.940
A boy harpooner of 18,
40 years ago.

25:33.942 --> 25:39.546
Forty years of constant whaling.

25:39.548 --> 25:45.018
Forty years
of privation, peril.

25:45.020 --> 25:48.454
Storm time on the pitiless seas.

25:48.456 --> 25:52.858
For 40 years has Ahab
forsaken peaceful land

25:52.860 --> 25:57.099
to make war
on the horrors of the deep.

25:58.466 --> 26:00.468
Then the madness.

26:01.869 --> 26:04.236
The frenzy.

26:04.238 --> 26:07.941
The boiling blood
and the smoking brow

26:07.943 --> 26:11.778
with which,
for a thousand lowerings,

26:11.780 --> 26:16.249
has Ahab furiously...

26:16.251 --> 26:19.152
and foamingly chased his prey

26:19.154 --> 26:22.722
more demon than man.

26:22.724 --> 26:28.630
Aye, what a forty years' fool
has old Ahab been.

26:31.666 --> 26:32.600
Brava!

26:33.667 --> 26:35.503
Brava!

26:36.871 --> 26:38.871
Ohh!

26:38.873 --> 26:42.975
I hope for your sake,
you can control her.

26:42.977 --> 26:46.815
If there's a slip-up,
I'll have you fired.

26:59.293 --> 27:06.031
At last Ahab stands before us
with a crucifixion in his face.

27:06.033 --> 27:11.971
A grand, ungodly God-like man,
he lives in this world

27:11.973 --> 27:16.142
as the last grizzly bears
live in settled Missouri.

27:16.144 --> 27:20.280
His grim aspect
affects me powerfully,

27:20.282 --> 27:24.720
as does the barbaric white leg
in which he stands.

27:29.724 --> 27:33.225
What do ye do
when ye see a whale?

27:33.227 --> 27:34.793
WOMEN: Sing out for him!

27:34.795 --> 27:36.162
And what do ye next?

27:36.164 --> 27:38.630
Lower away and after him!

27:38.632 --> 27:41.300
And what song do ye pull to?

27:41.302 --> 27:44.136
A dead whale
or a stove boat!

27:44.138 --> 27:49.274
Do you see this Spanish
ounce of gold, men?

27:49.276 --> 27:50.676
Aye, Captain!

27:50.678 --> 27:53.279
Oh, my, she is quite good.

27:53.281 --> 27:55.080
Yes!

27:55.082 --> 27:57.082
I insisted
she be in the play.

27:57.084 --> 28:00.819
BEATRICE: A wrinkled brow,
a crooked law,

28:00.821 --> 28:05.124
and three holes
in his starboard fluke.

28:05.126 --> 28:09.695
He... shall have
this gold doubloon.

28:09.697 --> 28:10.899
[cheers]

28:12.233 --> 28:14.367
Captain Ahab,
is this white whale

28:14.369 --> 28:16.970
the one they call
Moby Dick?

28:16.972 --> 28:21.674
Aye. It was Moby Dick
that dismasted me.

28:21.676 --> 28:23.675
Sliced off my leg

28:23.677 --> 28:27.245
like a mower reaps
a blade of grass in the field.

28:27.247 --> 28:29.882
This is what ye ship for, men.

28:29.884 --> 28:34.119
To chase Moby Dick
over all sides of the Earth,

28:34.121 --> 28:38.357
until the white whale
spouts black blood.

28:38.359 --> 28:41.793
Ye harpooners,
flank me with your lances.

28:41.795 --> 28:44.931
Cross them here before me.

28:44.933 --> 28:47.399
Death to Moby Dick!

28:47.401 --> 28:50.837
Death to Moby Dick!

28:50.839 --> 28:56.579
God hunt us all if we do not
hunt him to his death.

28:58.812 --> 29:01.813
It's such a relief being
out of that straightjacket.

29:01.815 --> 29:06.985
Such a bother not being able to
scratch your nose or reach...

29:06.987 --> 29:09.257
the important bits.

29:13.962 --> 29:15.898
Mind if I borrow some thread?

29:20.935 --> 29:22.870
Some thread, I said.

29:25.305 --> 29:26.908
Much obliged.

29:28.709 --> 29:32.110
You're a quiet little mouse.

29:32.112 --> 29:34.382
Married to a minister,
they tell me.

29:36.251 --> 29:38.717
Now how does a minister's wife

29:38.719 --> 29:42.954
end up in an ungodly place
like this?

29:42.956 --> 29:45.758
- You'd have to ask my husband.
- Oh?

29:45.760 --> 29:48.794
And what story would he tell,
a cold bed?

29:48.796 --> 29:51.396
Quiet little church mouse
like you,

29:51.398 --> 29:55.334
an iceberg has better chance
of pleasing a husband.

29:55.336 --> 29:58.203
Is there anything moving
under the sea,

29:58.205 --> 30:01.676
or is it frozen
down there as well?

30:04.779 --> 30:08.915
Every minister I ever met
had a horny pecker.

30:08.917 --> 30:12.388
They just wrap
a white collar around it.

30:16.390 --> 30:18.857
I could teach you...

30:18.859 --> 30:21.493
about passion.

30:21.495 --> 30:25.266
Thaw the iceberg, as it were.

30:26.967 --> 30:28.202
Hmm?

30:29.737 --> 30:32.440
Get off of me,
you foul woman!

30:34.408 --> 30:36.876
Is that the best you've got?

30:36.878 --> 30:39.511
You're a whaler now.
Curse like one.

30:39.513 --> 30:42.214
Call me a bitch, a whore.

30:42.216 --> 30:43.515
Whore! Bitch!

30:43.517 --> 30:45.050
That's the idea!

30:45.052 --> 30:47.153
- Fuck! Cocksucker!
- Fuck! Cocksucker!

30:47.155 --> 30:50.088
- Shit!
- That's how sailors talk.

30:50.090 --> 30:52.759
What else do they have to do
on those long voyages,

30:52.761 --> 30:54.761
eh, church mouse?

30:54.763 --> 30:56.165
That's enough out of you two!

31:01.770 --> 31:04.837
The chief mate of the <i>Pequod</i>
is Starbuck,

31:04.839 --> 31:06.806
a native of Nantucket,

31:06.808 --> 31:10.309
a staid, steadfast man.

31:10.311 --> 31:13.245
Why the long face, Starbuck?

31:13.247 --> 31:16.115
I am game for
his crooked jaw, Captain,

31:16.117 --> 31:19.417
if it fairly comes in
the way of our business.

31:19.419 --> 31:22.454
But I came to hunt whales,
not my commander's...

31:22.456 --> 31:25.390
What's the matter, Starbuck?

31:25.392 --> 31:29.261
[crying, shrieking]

31:29.263 --> 31:31.297
You are pathetic.

31:31.299 --> 31:33.331
- [continues crying]
- Okay.

31:33.333 --> 31:35.334
"My commander's vengeance
on a dumb brute

31:35.336 --> 31:37.470
that simply smote thee
from blind instinct."

31:37.472 --> 31:40.338
- Come on, Silla.
- I can't work with this.

31:40.340 --> 31:42.241
Are we to believe
this whelping thing

31:42.243 --> 31:44.277
is first mate of the <i>Pequod?</i>

31:44.279 --> 31:48.013
You will work with whoever
Dr. Calhoun tells you to work.

31:48.015 --> 31:50.049
No, she is right.

31:50.051 --> 31:54.119
Ahab needs a Starbuck,
a seadog.

31:54.121 --> 31:56.121
But you see, Miss Price,

31:56.123 --> 31:58.760
I have a very limited
talent pool here.

32:00.261 --> 32:05.030
What about her?
She looks like she has balls.

32:05.032 --> 32:06.965
[Benjamin laughs]

32:06.967 --> 32:10.203
No, no, Matron Stokes
is not an actress,

32:10.205 --> 32:11.537
and she has a job to do.

32:11.539 --> 32:14.109
Let her finish the scene
with me.

32:17.078 --> 32:19.148
I did some acting in school.

32:32.560 --> 32:34.530
I am game...

32:38.198 --> 32:41.934
I am game for his crooked jaw,
Captain,

32:41.936 --> 32:45.338
if it fairly come in the way
of our business.

32:45.340 --> 32:48.007
But I came to hunt whales,
Captain,

32:48.009 --> 32:50.609
not my commander's vengeance
on a dumb brute

32:50.611 --> 32:53.346
that simply smote thee
from blindest instinct.

32:53.348 --> 32:55.447
Dumb brute?

32:55.449 --> 33:00.586
He has left innumerable
fatalities in his wake.

33:00.588 --> 33:06.392
I see in him not only
outrageous strength,

33:06.394 --> 33:11.931
but intelligent,
inscrutable malice.

33:11.933 --> 33:14.570
God keep us all.

33:18.673 --> 33:21.276
Let's keep going,
keep going.

33:24.311 --> 33:28.013
Horrible old man.

33:28.015 --> 33:32.117
My soul is overmatched
by a madman.

33:32.119 --> 33:34.956
Starbuck thinks me mad.

33:36.925 --> 33:39.191
But I am demonic.

33:39.193 --> 33:41.394
I am madness maddened.

33:41.396 --> 33:44.463
I plainly see
my miserable office,

33:44.465 --> 33:47.500
to obey, rebelling.

33:47.502 --> 33:51.303
And I must help him
to his impious end.

33:51.305 --> 33:55.074
Ye great gods,
come see if ye can swerve me.

33:55.076 --> 33:57.976
Ye cannot swerve me!

33:57.978 --> 34:03.049
My path to my fixed purpose
is laid with iron rails,

34:03.051 --> 34:08.320
whereon my soul
is grooved to run.

34:08.322 --> 34:12.324
I'd strike the sun
if it insulted me.

34:12.327 --> 34:15.226
Yet there is hope.

34:15.228 --> 34:17.963
Time and the tide flow wide,

34:17.965 --> 34:22.503
and the hated whale has the
round, watery globe to swim in.

34:26.007 --> 34:27.109
I like it.

34:29.509 --> 34:32.210
Are you willing, Matron?

34:32.212 --> 34:34.447
Anything I can do
to help, Doctor.

34:38.353 --> 34:40.455
- Boo!
- [gasps]

34:48.096 --> 34:51.433
Prettying yourself up
for your private rehearsal?

34:53.701 --> 34:55.701
You're pretty enough for me,
church mouse.

34:55.703 --> 34:57.603
Let me through.

34:57.605 --> 35:01.172
Couldn't hurt
your hopes of a release,

35:01.174 --> 35:03.208
if you open your legs
for him.

35:03.210 --> 35:04.744
He doesn't see me that way.

35:04.746 --> 35:06.612
Oh, my, my, my.

35:06.614 --> 35:09.348
How cloistered you've been.

35:09.350 --> 35:11.650
Come, come.

35:11.652 --> 35:14.022
I promise to be good.

35:20.560 --> 35:23.230
I've seen the way
he looks at you.

35:32.706 --> 35:34.442
Lick your lips.

35:38.612 --> 35:40.614
Now rub them together.

35:46.621 --> 35:49.124
A bit less ruined,
don't you think?

35:52.627 --> 35:53.762
A bit.

35:56.096 --> 35:59.066
And Cinderella
shall go to ball.

36:01.835 --> 36:04.272
That's my daughter's
favorite story.

36:06.206 --> 36:08.741
Mine too.

36:08.743 --> 36:12.179
I guess this makes me
the fairy godmother.

36:13.714 --> 36:17.148
BENJAMIN:
♪ You came from far away ♪

36:17.150 --> 36:21.719
♪ My dear, my dear ♪

36:21.721 --> 36:25.424
♪ You came from far away ♪

36:25.426 --> 36:29.594
♪ My dear, my dear ♪

36:29.596 --> 36:32.431
- [clears throat]
- ♪ You... ♪

36:32.433 --> 36:34.632
Isabel.
[chuckles]

36:34.634 --> 36:35.803
Please sit.

36:42.643 --> 36:45.543
Uh, before we begin,

36:45.545 --> 36:48.447
I'd like to tell you

36:48.449 --> 36:50.549
I sent your missive
to Mrs. Van Dyke

36:50.551 --> 36:52.217
of the Ladies' Society

36:52.219 --> 36:54.786
and enclosed your letter
to Rebecca.

36:54.788 --> 36:57.255
Thank you, Dr. Calhoun. I...

36:57.257 --> 36:59.525
I had almost given up hope.

36:59.527 --> 37:03.228
Please, when it's just us,
you can call me Benjamin.

37:03.230 --> 37:04.730
And it is I who should be
thanking you.

37:04.732 --> 37:07.369
Your work here
has been exemplary.

37:08.435 --> 37:09.802
It's been exhilarating.

37:09.804 --> 37:11.603
Oh, it is, isn't it?

37:11.605 --> 37:15.241
Blindly plunging like fate
into the lone Atlantic.

37:15.243 --> 37:16.545
[chuckles]

37:19.514 --> 37:22.648
My first love
was always the theater.

37:22.650 --> 37:24.916
When I was a boy,
my mother would say,

37:24.918 --> 37:29.288
"Benjamin
you're going to be a thespian."

37:29.290 --> 37:33.425
She would take me
to the theater every week.

37:33.427 --> 37:35.694
So I dropped out
of medical school,

37:35.696 --> 37:38.264
much to my father's chagrin.

37:38.266 --> 37:40.368
You became a doctor, after all.

37:42.936 --> 37:44.205
Yes.

37:46.273 --> 37:48.174
Well...

37:48.176 --> 37:51.643
my mother...

37:51.645 --> 37:53.681
she took her own life.

37:55.750 --> 37:57.248
She was troubled.

37:57.250 --> 37:59.585
Suffered from hysteria.

37:59.587 --> 38:04.657
So I was compelled
to take up medical school again

38:04.659 --> 38:08.927
with a focus on lunacy.
[scoffs]

38:08.929 --> 38:11.396
But I feel trapped.

38:11.398 --> 38:12.764
I do.

38:12.766 --> 38:15.270
Just like you.

38:17.538 --> 38:19.340
It isn't the same.

38:21.808 --> 38:24.809
Oh, no, of course not.

38:24.811 --> 38:26.480
No, it isn't.

38:27.781 --> 38:30.215
I'm sorry.

38:30.217 --> 38:33.321
Well, let's get to work.
The whale hunt, I believe.

38:41.462 --> 38:45.367
You're a good man, Benjamin.

38:48.335 --> 38:49.303
Ah!

38:50.438 --> 38:52.737
Whale.

38:52.739 --> 38:54.341
From here.

38:58.346 --> 38:59.712
The boat tears on.

38:59.714 --> 39:04.349
The vast swells
of the omnipotent sea.

39:04.351 --> 39:06.620
The surging, hollow roar
they make.

39:08.889 --> 39:10.692
Without the script.

39:12.525 --> 39:13.958
The brief suspended agony

39:13.960 --> 39:16.862
as the boat tips
on the knife-edge of the waves

39:16.864 --> 39:19.431
that threaten
to cut us in two.

39:19.433 --> 39:22.701
The sudden profound dip.

39:22.703 --> 39:25.837
[laughs]

39:25.839 --> 39:29.643
The headlong sled-like slide
down the other side.

39:31.279 --> 39:34.545
No raw recruit
marching for the first time

39:34.547 --> 39:37.483
into the fever heat
of his first battle

39:37.485 --> 39:39.817
has felt stronger emotions

39:39.819 --> 39:41.587
than the man who,
for the first time,

39:41.589 --> 39:44.023
finds himself
in the churned circle

39:44.025 --> 39:46.595
- of the hunted sperm whale.
- Sperm whale.

39:56.904 --> 39:58.737
BEATRICE: Thar she blows!

39:58.739 --> 40:01.840
There she blows
on the lee-beam!

40:01.842 --> 40:04.742
Pull, my fine hearts! Pull!

40:04.744 --> 40:07.545
Break your backs!
Sing out!

40:07.547 --> 40:10.683
A dead whale
or a stove boat!

40:10.685 --> 40:14.052
Snap your oars,
every mother's son of ye!

40:14.054 --> 40:17.989
Yes! Feel the surging waves!
I want to see sweat!

40:17.991 --> 40:20.391
Deidre, I want you to...

40:20.393 --> 40:23.628
Bodies in motion.
Bodies in motion.

40:23.630 --> 40:26.098
BEATRICE: The devil fetch ye,
you dogs.

40:26.100 --> 40:27.800
Pull, will ye?

40:27.802 --> 40:29.768
Long and strong!

40:29.770 --> 40:32.670
Keep rowing! Come on, ladies!
We're on a boat!

40:32.672 --> 40:35.474
- Keep rowing! Keep on going!
- Looky-loo!

40:35.476 --> 40:37.543
- There's his hump!
- [whale roars]

40:37.545 --> 40:40.112
Aim for his eye!
Give it to him!

40:40.114 --> 40:43.849
All of a sudden, a gush of
scalding liquid shoots up.

40:43.851 --> 40:46.751
Something rolls
like an earthquake beneath us.

40:46.753 --> 40:50.054
We are tossed into the
curdling cream of the squall.

40:50.056 --> 40:52.393
In, in, in, in!

40:56.663 --> 40:59.364
BENJAMIN: You're flailing
in the ocean, ladies!

40:59.366 --> 41:01.366
The waves
are washing over you.

41:01.368 --> 41:02.967
The waves are washing over you!

41:02.969 --> 41:05.737
[yelling, laughing]

41:05.739 --> 41:09.041
[Benjamin laughing]

41:09.043 --> 41:11.680
[laughter, yelling continues]

41:15.415 --> 41:16.982
BENJAMIN: All right, come on,
everybody up.

41:16.984 --> 41:21.018
Ishmael, you've got
a certain little glow.

41:21.020 --> 41:23.121
You've gone and done it,
haven't you?

41:23.123 --> 41:24.723
You naughty little church mouse.

41:24.725 --> 41:26.795
You mustn't say a thing.

41:33.400 --> 41:35.502
We should keep this
between us.

41:48.516 --> 41:50.715
Oh, there you are.

41:50.717 --> 41:52.116
How are you this morning?

41:52.118 --> 41:54.420
Perfectly well.
And you?

41:54.422 --> 41:56.487
Marvelous.

41:56.489 --> 42:01.058
Ahab ferociously studies his
charts and plans his course.

42:01.060 --> 42:04.663
In the east, you will be my
beast.

42:04.665 --> 42:08.536
That is where I shall
wreak my revenge.

42:10.503 --> 42:12.971
That's your cue, Starbuck.

42:12.973 --> 42:14.773
The oil in the hold
is leaking, sir.

42:14.775 --> 42:16.675
We must heave to
and repair.

42:16.677 --> 42:19.210
And spend a week
tinkering with old gaskets?

42:19.212 --> 42:22.146
But we could waste more oil
in one day

42:22.148 --> 42:24.016
than we make good
in a full year.

42:24.018 --> 42:26.717
What does Ahab care?
On deck.

42:26.719 --> 42:29.621
Captain!

42:29.623 --> 42:32.824
Does thou dare contradict me?

42:32.826 --> 42:34.726
Nay, sir.

42:34.728 --> 42:36.865
I do but entreat thee.

42:40.534 --> 42:45.036
There is but one God
that lords over the Earth

42:45.038 --> 42:47.905
and one captain
that lords over the <i>Pequod.</i>

42:47.907 --> 42:51.143
On deck!
Thou hast outraged me.

42:51.145 --> 42:52.811
Thou hast outraged me, sir.

42:52.813 --> 42:54.880
And for that, I ask thee
not to beware of Starbuck.

42:54.882 --> 42:56.882
Thou wouldst but laugh.

42:56.884 --> 43:00.552
But let Ahab beware of Ahab.

43:00.554 --> 43:02.657
Beware of thyself, old man.

43:08.161 --> 43:09.496
Doctor!

43:11.197 --> 43:13.699
Hold on. It's okay.

43:13.701 --> 43:15.132
Keep going.
Keep the intensity.

43:15.134 --> 43:18.770
There is one God.

43:18.772 --> 43:20.204
Eh, Starbuck?

43:20.206 --> 43:22.741
- Eh?!
- [gasping]

43:22.743 --> 43:24.909
Yes! All right.

43:24.911 --> 43:27.246
Now let her go.
Beatrice, stop at once!

43:27.248 --> 43:28.713
- All right, all right.
- Beatrice!

43:28.715 --> 43:30.717
[gasping]

43:32.552 --> 43:34.253
All right.

43:34.255 --> 43:36.558
All right.

43:37.891 --> 43:40.858
Well, that certainly
was visceral.

43:40.860 --> 43:42.860
She almost killed me.

43:42.862 --> 43:47.132
If I wanted to kill you,
you would be dead.

43:47.134 --> 43:49.300
You said you wanted
to be in the play.

43:49.302 --> 43:52.003
Then be in the play!

43:52.005 --> 43:54.038
It seems to me
what you really want

43:54.040 --> 43:56.541
is Calhoun's cock
in your quim.

43:56.543 --> 43:59.076
But guess what.
Ishmael beat you to it.

43:59.078 --> 44:02.549
That is enough nonsense
out of you, Beatrice!

44:10.089 --> 44:12.224
- Benjamin.
- Huh?

44:12.226 --> 44:15.697
What's going on between
you and that Wallace woman?

44:17.230 --> 44:18.663
Absolutely nothing.

44:18.665 --> 44:19.998
Then what was

You know I would never
consort with a patient.

44:34.714 --> 44:37.181
Phoebe, I need you
on my side.

44:37.183 --> 44:41.052
Without you, this entire
enterprise collapses.

44:45.359 --> 44:47.793
- Of course I am.

What the devil
is she doing in here?

I don't know.
Kara, no, no.

45:00.773 --> 45:03.241
I'm not telling you
another thing.

45:03.243 --> 45:05.242
You announced it
in front of everybody.

- This is not the time.
- I trusted you.

01:01:13.279 --> 01:01:16.346
Matron Stokes, you will
be receiving the blood treatment

01:01:16.348 --> 01:01:18.017
like the rest of patients.

01:01:19.851 --> 01:01:23.954
- What?
- If you want to be in my cast,

01:01:23.956 --> 01:01:26.958
you will behave like a man.

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:29.326
Dr. Calhoun, you overstep.

01:01:29.328 --> 01:01:31.329
I am the head matron
at this facility,

01:01:31.331 --> 01:01:33.029
not one of your patients,

01:01:33.031 --> 01:01:36.068
and I will not be receiving
any sort of treatment.

01:01:38.737 --> 01:01:41.938
I am truly disappointed.

01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:44.909
I thought you were
committed to this.

01:01:44.911 --> 01:01:48.882
But now I can see
you're just as weak as them.

01:01:52.851 --> 01:01:54.020
No!

01:01:58.991 --> 01:02:00.060
[grunts]

01:02:03.630 --> 01:02:04.728
No!

01:02:04.730 --> 01:02:06.232
[straining]

01:02:10.235 --> 01:02:14.007
[panting]

01:02:31.991 --> 01:02:33.726
Beatrice!

01:03:16.402 --> 01:03:19.070
All right, let's begin with
the Queequeg scene, shall we?

01:03:19.072 --> 01:03:21.308
[crying]

01:03:23.076 --> 01:03:26.177
All right, I realize
that we've lost Kara.

01:03:26.179 --> 01:03:27.978
It's unfortunate.

01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:31.181
We will have to recast.
All right, Mrs. Wallace,

01:03:31.183 --> 01:03:34.388
I've changed the dialogue
for Queequeg to narration.

01:03:35.822 --> 01:03:37.154
Your treatment killed her.

01:03:37.156 --> 01:03:38.355
Come now!

01:03:38.357 --> 01:03:40.291
There is no connection,
all right?

01:03:40.293 --> 01:03:42.092
She's prone to seizures.

01:03:42.094 --> 01:03:44.094
- Where's Beatrice?
- She's not in this scene.

01:03:44.096 --> 01:03:47.297
Griselda, would you mind
filling in for Kara for today?

01:03:47.299 --> 01:03:50.233
Let's get you in here.

01:03:50.235 --> 01:03:51.938
There you go.

01:03:54.306 --> 01:03:55.442
[snaps fingers]

01:04:05.851 --> 01:04:08.284
Queequeg told me it is the
custom of his race

01:04:08.286 --> 01:04:10.755
to stretch out
a dead warrior in a canoe

01:04:10.757 --> 01:04:13.023
and let him float away.

01:04:13.025 --> 01:04:16.427
He shudders at the thought
of being buried in his hammock,

01:04:16.429 --> 01:04:18.529
as is the custom at sea.

01:04:18.531 --> 01:04:19.764
Wait, please.

01:04:19.766 --> 01:04:20.767
[clears throat]

01:04:22.134 --> 01:04:23.402
[clears throat]

01:04:25.804 --> 01:04:28.304
I'm not feeling
your sorrow, Isabel.

01:04:28.306 --> 01:04:30.474
Surely this is
an opportunity for you

01:04:30.476 --> 01:04:34.344
to channel your feelings
for Kara, you know?

01:04:34.346 --> 01:04:36.447
You're thinking too much.

01:04:36.449 --> 01:04:37.848
Don't think.

01:04:37.850 --> 01:04:40.252
Feel. Feel.

01:04:41.386 --> 01:04:42.955
Feel.

01:04:46.058 --> 01:04:48.324
Carry on.

01:04:48.326 --> 01:04:51.462
He recalls that he has seen
dead sailors in Nantucket

01:04:51.464 --> 01:04:53.496
laid to rest in canoes.

01:04:53.498 --> 01:04:57.967
He means coffins.
And he desires one for himself.

01:04:57.969 --> 01:05:01.838
If I may...
[chuckling]

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:05.241
you're watching your friend
slowly waste away.

01:05:05.243 --> 01:05:11.549
How does it make you feel?

01:05:11.551 --> 01:05:14.384
Fear?

01:05:14.386 --> 01:05:17.320
Grief?

01:05:17.322 --> 01:05:19.924
Anger?

01:05:19.926 --> 01:05:23.527
There's something
burning inside.

01:05:23.529 --> 01:05:24.994
Hmm?

01:05:24.996 --> 01:05:27.032
How much does it hurt?

01:05:29.868 --> 01:05:30.867
A lot.

01:05:30.869 --> 01:05:32.239
A lot.

01:05:33.605 --> 01:05:36.877
Show me a lot.

01:05:44.851 --> 01:05:50.454
The ship's carpenter took
his measure and went to work.

01:05:50.456 --> 01:05:54.324
Now the last nail
has been driven.

01:05:54.326 --> 01:05:58.061
Queequeg entreats to be lifted
into his final bed,

01:05:58.063 --> 01:06:00.332
along with his harpoon.

01:06:03.469 --> 01:06:05.438
Are those tears?

01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:10.574
Ishmael is a man!

01:06:10.576 --> 01:06:12.242
You understand?

01:06:12.244 --> 01:06:15.346
Men do not show their grief
in that manner!

01:06:15.348 --> 01:06:18.047
Blast it, women! I mean,
do we need another transfusion?

01:06:18.049 --> 01:06:19.382
- Is that what we want?
- [screams]

01:06:19.384 --> 01:06:21.652
Do you want
another transfusion, huh?

01:06:21.654 --> 01:06:23.621
[crying]

01:06:23.623 --> 01:06:26.123
Show me some masculinity
like Phoebe!

01:06:26.125 --> 01:06:29.125
That's what I need!
Now, now...

01:06:29.127 --> 01:06:31.594
some of you sailors
will lift up Queequeg

01:06:31.596 --> 01:06:34.030
into his lovely coffin
that I've had made,

01:06:34.032 --> 01:06:37.201
but for now, Griselda, let's get
you in the coffin, come on.

01:06:37.203 --> 01:06:39.235
GRISELDA: I'd rather not.
BENJAMIN: No, no, no, it's okay.

01:06:39.237 --> 01:06:41.337
It's nonsense.
This is just make-believe.

01:06:41.339 --> 01:06:43.474
There it is. Wonderful.

01:06:43.476 --> 01:06:45.541
Manly strength.
Manly strength. Go.

01:06:45.543 --> 01:06:47.444
Isabel, come down,
say your lines.

01:06:47.446 --> 01:06:48.581
Come down and say your lines!

01:06:51.616 --> 01:06:53.650
Queequeg is placed
in the coffin.

01:06:53.652 --> 01:06:55.219
He lies without moving,

01:06:55.221 --> 01:06:56.487
his arms crossed over
his breast...

01:06:56.489 --> 01:06:58.288
Out here, out here.

01:06:58.290 --> 01:07:00.056
while the coffin lid
is placed over him,

01:07:00.058 --> 01:07:03.192
- and the sails...
- Ah!

01:07:03.194 --> 01:07:05.965
Our Ahab has returned to us.

01:07:07.967 --> 01:07:11.538
Are you ready to return
to the fold, Beatrice?

01:07:15.708 --> 01:07:17.577
One condition.

01:07:20.612 --> 01:07:26.116
You get Edward Fry...
to attend,

01:07:26.118 --> 01:07:29.219
and I'll perform.

01:07:29.221 --> 01:07:33.023
I would love Edward Fry
to come.

01:07:33.025 --> 01:07:36.092
But how do you expect me
to do that?

01:07:36.094 --> 01:07:39.031
Just mention my name.

01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:42.902
[horse neighs]

01:07:44.203 --> 01:07:46.907
[distant chatter]

01:07:56.315 --> 01:07:57.982
Mr. Fry?

01:07:57.984 --> 01:08:00.451
Excuse me, sir.
Please stay back.

01:08:00.453 --> 01:08:02.152
Can I speak to Mr. Fry?

01:08:02.154 --> 01:08:05.358
Mr. Fry's a busy man.
Please move along.

01:08:12.498 --> 01:08:15.936
[clamoring]

01:08:20.104 --> 01:08:23.509
[clamor continues]

01:08:31.616 --> 01:08:34.486
[commotion]

01:08:37.423 --> 01:08:39.693
[yelling]

01:08:45.029 --> 01:08:46.328
Yeah! Yeah!

01:08:46.331 --> 01:08:50.270
[cheering]

01:09:02.346 --> 01:09:03.814
Mr. Fry, good evening, sir.

01:09:03.816 --> 01:09:05.616
My name is Dr. Benjamin Calhoun.

01:09:05.618 --> 01:09:07.551
I'd like to talk to you
about a theatrical endeavor.

01:09:07.553 --> 01:09:09.353
Excuse me!

01:09:09.354 --> 01:09:10.787
- Not tonight, all right?
- I would like to have a word.

01:09:10.788 --> 01:09:13.791
- Jeremy.
- Yeah?

01:09:13.792 --> 01:09:16.693
- A wager on Lizzy.
- Of course.

01:09:16.694 --> 01:09:18.197
To lose.

01:09:19.663 --> 01:09:21.532
Very good, sir.

01:09:21.533 --> 01:09:23.567
- If I could have a moment...
- I don't think so.

01:09:23.569 --> 01:09:27.304
- It's just a...
- Listen, nothing tonight, okay?

01:09:27.305 --> 01:09:29.073
Of course, yes, yes, yes.

01:09:29.075 --> 01:09:32.176
I am mounting a play
at the asylum where I work.

01:09:32.178 --> 01:09:33.676
Mr. Fry does not...

01:09:33.678 --> 01:09:35.377
Would you get your hands
off of me?

01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:36.511
Ow! Ow!

01:09:36.514 --> 01:09:38.250
I have Beatrice Price!

01:09:40.486 --> 01:09:42.685
You have Beatrice Price?

01:09:42.687 --> 01:09:44.654
Yes.

01:09:44.656 --> 01:09:46.392
On stage?

01:09:47.593 --> 01:09:49.827
BENJAMIN: All right, Isabel,

01:09:49.828 --> 01:09:51.528
please give us the lines

01:09:51.529 --> 01:09:54.067
that describe
Queequeg's resurrection.

01:09:59.704 --> 01:10:03.474
Queequeg suddenly rallies
and is half-well within a day.

01:10:03.476 --> 01:10:07.677
He leaps to his feet,
stretches his arms and legs, yawns

01:10:07.679 --> 01:10:10.146
and finds himself fit for a
fight.

01:10:10.148 --> 01:10:13.119
He begins to use his coffin
as a sea chest.

01:10:15.521 --> 01:10:17.253
Here they are.

01:10:17.255 --> 01:10:18.721
Dr. Calhoun, everyone.

01:10:18.723 --> 01:10:19.723
Yes.

01:10:19.725 --> 01:10:22.462
A distinguished guest.

01:10:25.364 --> 01:10:26.499
Beatrice

01:10:28.133 --> 01:10:29.234
Come here.

01:10:31.402 --> 01:10:33.703
Let me look at you.

01:10:33.705 --> 01:10:36.075
You left me here.

01:10:37.543 --> 01:10:41.744
Beatrice, I tried,
but you committed murder.

01:10:41.746 --> 01:10:45.381
We saved your life
by declaring you insane.

01:10:45.383 --> 01:10:47.283
Mr. Fry.

01:10:47.285 --> 01:10:49.485
Good to see you, sir.

01:10:49.487 --> 01:10:50.921
Al...

01:10:50.923 --> 01:10:53.657
Please don't let me interrupt.
Continue.

01:10:53.659 --> 01:10:55.725
Oh, yes. We were just about
to start rehearsing

01:10:55.727 --> 01:10:59.162
the "Captain, my captain" scene.

01:10:59.164 --> 01:11:03.202
Uh, Isabel,
whenever you are ready.

01:11:05.803 --> 01:11:07.837
The ship tears on,

01:11:07.839 --> 01:11:09.739
leaving such a furrow
in the sea

01:11:09.741 --> 01:11:12.475
as when a ploughshare
churns up a field.

01:11:12.477 --> 01:11:15.945
Stand close to me,
Starbuck.

01:11:15.947 --> 01:11:18.782
Let
me look into a human eye.

01:11:18.784 --> 01:11:22.385
It Is better
than to gaze upon God.

01:11:22.387 --> 01:11:26.422
I can see my wife and child
in thine eye.

01:11:26.424 --> 01:11:29.458
Captain, my captain,

01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:32.261
noble soul,
grand old heart after all.

01:11:32.263 --> 01:11:35.866
BEATRICE: What cruel,
remorseless emperor commands me

01:11:35.868 --> 01:11:39.735
that against
all natural longings,

01:11:39.737 --> 01:11:43.473
I so keep pushing recklessly,

01:11:43.475 --> 01:11:46.475
making me ready to do

01:11:46.477 --> 01:11:50.980
what in my own natural heart
I durst not dare?

01:11:50.982 --> 01:11:55.985
Is Ahab, Ahab?

01:11:55.987 --> 01:12:02.762
Is it I, God, or who
that lifts this arm?

01:12:15.807 --> 01:12:16.808
Remarkable.

01:12:20.379 --> 01:12:22.882
Do you have any comments,
Mr. Fry?

01:12:24.383 --> 01:12:25.948
No, not at all,

01:12:25.950 --> 01:12:29.720
but I'd appreciate a moment
alone with Miss Price.

01:12:29.722 --> 01:12:31.887
Well, however we can
accommodate you.

01:12:31.889 --> 01:12:36.627
Would everyone except Beatrice
please clear the room?

01:12:36.629 --> 01:12:40.596
I'd like you to meet
Mrs. Isabel Wallace.

01:12:40.598 --> 01:12:44.033
She has all the makings
of a true actress.

01:12:44.035 --> 01:12:47.304
Mrs. Wallace, I'm charmed.

01:12:47.306 --> 01:12:50.674
Yes, Mrs. Wallace
has been doing remarkable.

01:12:50.676 --> 01:12:52.509
I've really been
working with her.

01:12:52.511 --> 01:12:55.645
Call me Isabel.

01:12:55.647 --> 01:12:57.883
Would you care to join us?

01:12:59.951 --> 01:13:01.551
- Doctor.
- Yes?

01:13:01.553 --> 01:13:03.287
We'll fetch you shortly.

01:13:03.289 --> 01:13:06.456
You wish for me to leave
as well?

01:13:06.458 --> 01:13:09.928
Come, come, Calhoun.
Let the artists have a moment.

01:13:11.496 --> 01:13:13.266
Yes, of course.

01:13:26.645 --> 01:13:29.445
Benjamin.

01:13:29.447 --> 01:13:31.415
Benjamin, please,
get ahold of yourself.

01:13:31.417 --> 01:13:35.618
Do you have any idea
what this could mean?

01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:39.355
Listen, I admit I was
skeptical at first,

01:13:39.357 --> 01:13:41.358
but Edward Fry?

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:46.529
The famous theatrical
impresario in the flesh.

01:13:46.531 --> 01:13:50.766
Do you have any idea
how many wealthy patrons?

01:13:50.768 --> 01:13:55.505
New York, Boston,
he has them in his pocket.

01:13:55.507 --> 01:13:58.875
With his support,
we could reach new donors,

01:13:58.877 --> 01:14:00.609
wealthy sponsors.

01:14:00.611 --> 01:14:02.078
Benjamin, please,

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:06.783
it could lead to advanced
equipment, facilities.

01:14:06.785 --> 01:14:10.420
You must do everything you can
to keep his interest,

01:14:10.422 --> 01:14:12.325
do you hear me?

01:14:21.366 --> 01:14:23.100
It's been too long.

01:14:23.102 --> 01:14:25.568
God knows what they are
getting up to in there.

01:14:25.570 --> 01:14:26.603
Benjamin no!

01:14:26.605 --> 01:14:27.773
- Benjamin!
- [door slams]

01:14:28.639 --> 01:14:30.776
Dr. Calhoun.

01:14:32.544 --> 01:14:35.945
The women were just
telling me all about you.

01:14:35.947 --> 01:14:38.450
Please have a seat.

01:14:50.462 --> 01:14:53.063
What you are doing here...

01:14:53.065 --> 01:14:54.930
is bold.

01:14:54.932 --> 01:14:58.100
Revolutionary.

01:14:58.102 --> 01:14:59.702
By accident, I suspect,

01:14:59.704 --> 01:15:03.172
as I doubt alone
you had the vision

01:15:03.174 --> 01:15:05.744
to cast all the roles
with women.

01:15:06.879 --> 01:15:08.811
However...

01:15:08.813 --> 01:15:12.948
this play has the potential
to be sensual,

01:15:12.950 --> 01:15:14.451
provocative,

01:15:14.453 --> 01:15:15.918
transcendent even.

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:19.422
With two radiant women
at its core,

01:15:19.424 --> 01:15:21.026
all good fortune to you.

01:15:23.128 --> 01:15:27.930
So I've decided to offer
my patronage.

01:15:27.932 --> 01:15:31.100
That means an audience,

01:15:31.102 --> 01:15:32.969
publicity,

01:15:32.971 --> 01:15:38.073
and potential funding
for future endeavors.

01:15:38.075 --> 01:15:40.042
Furthermore,

01:15:40.044 --> 01:15:44.881
I will host the performance
at my own Palace Theater.

01:15:44.883 --> 01:15:48.217
Oh, Mr. Fry, that would be...

01:15:48.219 --> 01:15:50.686
Naturally,
there are some conditions.

01:15:50.688 --> 01:15:55.492
First, Beatrice will
take over all staging,

01:15:55.494 --> 01:15:57.597
blocking
and choreography.

01:15:59.932 --> 01:16:04.801
Oh, uhh, that sounds
like you mean

01:16:04.803 --> 01:16:06.802
for her to direct
the entire play.

01:16:06.804 --> 01:16:09.639
Yes, that's right!

01:16:09.641 --> 01:16:11.908
But we'll still use your fine
script.

01:16:11.910 --> 01:16:16.479
The only reason
Beatrice Price isn't recognized

01:16:16.481 --> 01:16:19.683
as one of the great
directors of our time

01:16:19.685 --> 01:16:21.016
is that the world of theater

01:16:21.018 --> 01:16:26.021
is plagued by envy-ridden
misogynists.

01:16:26.023 --> 01:16:28.591
- Now, Mr. Fry, with all due resp...
- [stamps floor]

01:16:28.593 --> 01:16:30.596
I'm not finished.

01:16:33.565 --> 01:16:37.801
Monomania seized him.

01:16:37.803 --> 01:16:42.238
Isn't that what Melville
wrote about Ahab?

01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:46.743
You have lost your way,
Dr. Calhoun.

01:16:46.745 --> 01:16:51.747
Now the only way to succeed
is to turn over your play

01:16:51.749 --> 01:16:54.251
to surer hands.

01:16:54.253 --> 01:16:56.889
Dr. Withers, I trust
there are no objections.

01:17:00.057 --> 01:17:01.891
None whatsoever.

01:17:01.893 --> 01:17:05.761
Great.
Jeremy will come every day

01:17:05.763 --> 01:17:10.300
to ensure that things proceed
as I've describe.

01:17:10.302 --> 01:17:13.539
I'll expect regular reports.

01:17:14.839 --> 01:17:17.810
Good day, ladies,
and good luck.

01:17:26.685 --> 01:17:28.717
You women!

01:17:28.719 --> 01:17:31.688
Where is your loyalty?

01:17:31.690 --> 01:17:33.756
Transcendent? Provocative?

01:17:33.758 --> 01:17:36.259
I wrote this!

01:17:36.261 --> 01:17:40.199
Surely, Mr. Melville
deserves some of the credit.

01:17:51.343 --> 01:17:53.813
You're still in, aren't you?

01:17:55.047 --> 01:17:58.582
I'm still in.
Of course.

01:17:58.584 --> 01:18:02.522
It's my only way
of seeing Rebecca..

01:18:04.623 --> 01:18:08.091
[sighs]
But then what?

01:18:08.093 --> 01:18:12.095
She sees me on stage
with madwomen, the play ends,

01:18:12.097 --> 01:18:16.032
she goes home,
and I'm still trapped here.

01:18:16.034 --> 01:18:20.639
This play could be our way out.

01:18:22.139 --> 01:18:25.708
We have to leave the grounds
to perform.

01:18:25.710 --> 01:18:30.613
I'm orchestrating
all the action.

01:18:30.615 --> 01:18:34.920
All eyes will be
turned toward the stage.

01:18:38.757 --> 01:18:39.859
We escape?

01:18:42.227 --> 01:18:44.063
Exactly.

01:18:46.231 --> 01:18:48.297
Edward will support us,

01:18:48.299 --> 01:18:50.332
provide us
with means of departure.

01:18:50.334 --> 01:18:54.637
What about Rebecca?
I can't leave her with him.

01:18:54.639 --> 01:18:58.641
We can figure that out too.

01:18:58.643 --> 01:19:02.347
I never told anyone
why my husband put me here.

01:19:04.182 --> 01:19:07.519
Every year,
Tobias buys a brand-new cane.

01:19:11.389 --> 01:19:13.859
He tests them on me.

01:19:19.830 --> 01:19:22.868
Always in places nobody sees.

01:19:59.004 --> 01:20:00.403
You wouldn't dare.

01:20:00.405 --> 01:20:03.872
Hit me in the face,
you coward.

01:20:03.874 --> 01:20:05.977
Strike me where
everyone can see.

01:20:12.217 --> 01:20:13.283
- Stop it!
- No!

01:20:13.285 --> 01:20:14.850
- Stop it!
- Do it! Do it!

01:20:14.852 --> 01:20:16.888
Hit me in the face!

01:20:18.089 --> 01:20:19.424
Do it!

01:20:28.933 --> 01:20:30.669
Madwoman.

01:20:41.012 --> 01:20:43.081
You're not mad.

01:20:45.316 --> 01:20:49.387
Your husband is.
Just like mine was.

01:20:53.290 --> 01:20:55.927
We did what we had to do.

01:21:05.337 --> 01:21:07.770
BENJAMIN: Happens all too often.

01:21:07.772 --> 01:21:12.844
Artists, visionaries
die unknown.

01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:30.329
WOMAN: <i>Benjamin Calhoun.</i>

01:21:33.798 --> 01:21:35.165
CHAIRMAN: <i>It's women
or nothing.</i>

01:21:35.167 --> 01:21:36.933
Who's there?

01:21:36.935 --> 01:21:40.103
ISABEL: <i>All you care about
is this absurd play.</i>

01:21:40.105 --> 01:21:42.538
PHOEBE: <i>Benjamin,
we're just women.</i>

01:21:42.540 --> 01:21:44.340
<i>Benjamin.</i>

01:21:44.342 --> 01:21:47.844
MARY: <i>Whosoever of ye raises me
a white-headed whale...</i>

01:21:47.846 --> 01:21:51.250
BEATRICE: <i>You're a joke.
The whole play is a joke.</i>

01:21:53.351 --> 01:21:55.018
<i>We are in a loony bin</i>

01:21:55.020 --> 01:21:58.520
<i>and your cast
is comprised of madwomen.</i>

01:21:58.522 --> 01:22:00.959
You're dead, whale.

01:22:03.027 --> 01:22:05.830
From hell's heart,
I stab at thee.

01:22:07.598 --> 01:22:09.998
ISABEL: <i>Surely,
Mr. Melville deserves</i>

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.003
<i>some of the credit too.</i>

01:22:12.036 --> 01:22:13.569
[Benjamin groans]

01:22:13.571 --> 01:22:16.439
<i>[Kara laughing]</i>

01:22:16.441 --> 01:22:18.308
ISABEL: As dawn broke,

01:22:18.310 --> 01:22:21.845
Ahab could be seen
staring out at sea.

01:22:21.847 --> 01:22:26.448
Oh, what a lovely day.

01:22:26.450 --> 01:22:32.121
A fair day could not dawn
upon the world.

01:22:32.123 --> 01:22:34.556
Here's a thought.

01:22:34.558 --> 01:22:38.394
What if Ahab
had time to think?

01:22:38.396 --> 01:22:41.497
But Ahab never thinks.

01:22:41.499 --> 01:22:43.966
He only feels.

01:22:43.968 --> 01:22:46.368
Feels, feels!

01:22:46.370 --> 01:22:49.238
To think would be audacity.

01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:53.076
God only has that right
and privilege.

01:22:53.078 --> 01:22:55.110
Our poor hearts throb

01:22:55.112 --> 01:22:58.614
and our poor brains
beat too much for that.

01:22:58.616 --> 01:23:01.052
There she blows!

01:23:03.021 --> 01:23:05.454
With a hump like a snow hill!

01:23:05.456 --> 01:23:07.957
'Tis Moby Dick!
Did none of you see it first?

01:23:07.959 --> 01:23:10.359
PHOEBE: I saw him
the same instant you did!

01:23:10.361 --> 01:23:13.199
- Ready the boats!
- There she breaches!

01:23:19.437 --> 01:23:21.938
Wondrous phenomenon!

01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:25.140
Rising with utmost velocity
from the furthest depths,

01:23:25.142 --> 01:23:30.380
the whale booms his entire bulk
into the pure element of air.

01:23:30.382 --> 01:23:34.016
BEATRICE: Do you feel brave,
my hearties?

01:23:34.018 --> 01:23:37.252
WOMEN: Aye!
Brave as fearless fire!

01:23:37.254 --> 01:23:40.390
Keep pulling!
Lower those boats!

01:23:40.392 --> 01:23:43.091
PHOEBE: In Jesus' name,
no more of this!

01:23:43.093 --> 01:23:45.461
It is worse than
devil's madness!

01:23:45.463 --> 01:23:47.529
Never wilt thou capture
Moby Dick.

01:23:47.531 --> 01:23:51.033
Yea, I'll ten times girdle
the unmeasured

01:23:51.035 --> 01:23:53.036
globe and dive
straight through it,

01:23:53.038 --> 01:23:55.104
but I'll slay him yet.

01:23:55.106 --> 01:23:57.974
Shall we keep chasing
this murderous fish

01:23:57.976 --> 01:24:00.676
till we be dragged to
the infernal bottom of the sea?

01:24:00.678 --> 01:24:04.713
Some men die at ebb tide,

01:24:04.715 --> 01:24:06.683
some at low water,

01:24:06.685 --> 01:24:10.185
some at the full of the flood.

01:24:10.187 --> 01:24:12.657
Shake hands with me, man!

01:24:15.026 --> 01:24:20.532
O captain, my captain.
noble heart, go not.

01:24:24.502 --> 01:24:28.337
One and... Steady.

01:24:28.339 --> 01:24:30.038
Great.

01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:33.309
Okay, now my rowers,
on my count.

01:24:33.311 --> 01:24:41.149
It's to the one and two
and one and right and...

01:24:41.151 --> 01:24:43.752
Yes! It's looking good, ladies.

01:24:43.754 --> 01:24:46.055
Are you ready, Matron?

01:24:46.057 --> 01:24:50.259
The boats dart forward
to attack.

01:24:50.261 --> 01:24:53.932
All paddles plying
with rippling swiftness.

01:25:03.208 --> 01:25:05.475
Look out! Keep thou keenest eye
on the boat

01:25:05.477 --> 01:25:07.042
and mark well the whale.

01:25:07.044 --> 01:25:09.644
They are nearing their foe.

01:25:09.646 --> 01:25:12.582
The entire dazzling hump
is distinctly visible,

01:25:12.584 --> 01:25:17.086
and the glistening shadow
of the broad, milky forehead

01:25:17.088 --> 01:25:19.124
of the unsuspecting prey.

01:25:21.125 --> 01:25:24.362
[whale singing]

01:25:27.164 --> 01:25:30.265
BEATRICE: And... nice.

01:25:30.267 --> 01:25:33.568
Not perfect,
but maybe we can use that.

01:25:33.570 --> 01:25:35.203
I like it.

01:25:35.205 --> 01:25:38.707
And, um, Mr. Starbuck,
if you please.

01:25:38.709 --> 01:25:42.278
Through the serene tranquil,
tropical sea,

01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:43.779
the glorious white moves on...

01:25:43.781 --> 01:25:45.814
Stop.

01:25:45.816 --> 01:25:47.683
What are you doing?

01:25:47.685 --> 01:25:50.819
Those are Ishmael's lines.
Why is Starbuck telling it?

01:25:50.821 --> 01:25:54.424
Ishmael is busy
on a whaling boat.

01:25:54.426 --> 01:25:57.393
Mr. Starbuck is standing
on the <i>Pequod,</i> watching.

01:25:57.395 --> 01:25:58.760
It makes sense.

01:25:58.762 --> 01:26:03.198
Fry suggested
you choreograph the action.

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:06.536
He didn't say you could
rewrite my script

01:26:06.538 --> 01:26:08.171
and massacre Melville.

01:26:08.173 --> 01:26:09.508
The script is set.

01:26:11.442 --> 01:26:12.410
Matron Stokes?

01:26:14.611 --> 01:26:17.313
I think it's a huge improvement.

01:26:17.315 --> 01:26:21.317
Please, sir,
why don't you have a seat

01:26:21.319 --> 01:26:23.489
and allow the ladies
to work, huh?

01:26:29.093 --> 01:26:33.496
Through the serene tranquilities
of the tropical sea,

01:26:33.498 --> 01:26:36.168
the glorified white whale
moves on.

01:26:37.468 --> 01:26:38.533
BEATRICE: Beautiful.

01:26:38.535 --> 01:26:43.639
Slow, graceful.

01:26:43.641 --> 01:26:45.675
Love it. Very feminine.

01:26:45.677 --> 01:26:47.577
This is a travesty.

01:26:47.579 --> 01:26:51.346
The whale is male.
The sailors are male.

01:26:51.348 --> 01:26:53.549
There is no room in the story
for femininity.

01:26:53.551 --> 01:26:55.150
You're destroying everything!

01:26:55.152 --> 01:26:58.787
Sir, I should hate
to report to Mr. Fry

01:26:58.789 --> 01:27:01.826
that you held up rehearsals.

01:27:10.602 --> 01:27:11.603
[door slams]

01:27:14.739 --> 01:27:15.805
Thank you.

01:27:15.807 --> 01:27:17.643
More lines for me.

01:27:20.911 --> 01:27:24.713
Okay, from the beginning,
everyone.

01:27:24.715 --> 01:27:26.649
I have news from Mr. Fry.

01:27:26.651 --> 01:27:30.385
One of his vessels will be
sailing from New Bedford soon.

01:27:30.387 --> 01:27:33.890
He has delayed its departure.

01:27:33.892 --> 01:27:35.394
Yeah.

01:27:39.763 --> 01:27:43.498
Um, okay, everybody ready?

01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:47.802
We open in three days.

01:27:47.804 --> 01:27:49.740
From the top!

01:27:53.811 --> 01:27:58.381
They come expecting
a freak show,

01:27:58.383 --> 01:28:03.485
but we shall show them
a theatrical spectacle.

01:28:03.487 --> 01:28:06.322
A grand adventure!

01:28:06.324 --> 01:28:08.823
We have weathered
many storms together.

01:28:08.825 --> 01:28:13.962
Our voyage beset with perils
from within...

01:28:13.964 --> 01:28:15.734
and without.

01:28:19.469 --> 01:28:22.872
But we have persevered!

01:28:22.874 --> 01:28:25.511
A dead whale or a stove boat.

01:28:28.213 --> 01:28:31.846
A dead whale or a stove boat!

01:28:31.848 --> 01:28:35.217
Yes, Doctor, we have it.

01:28:35.219 --> 01:28:37.686
We're as ready
as we'll ever be.

01:28:37.688 --> 01:28:39.825
Okay, let's get you all
backstage.

01:28:43.361 --> 01:28:46.898
He's the maddest one
out of all of us.

01:28:48.465 --> 01:28:49.468
BENJAMIN: Oh, Isabel.

01:28:52.837 --> 01:28:55.339
If I may, uh...

01:28:57.475 --> 01:29:00.379
I know it's been rocky
between us of late.

01:29:01.945 --> 01:29:06.349
But I, I feel
we had something special,

01:29:06.351 --> 01:29:10.885
and I'd like to get back to that
when this is over.

01:29:10.887 --> 01:29:15.257
So for my next production,

01:29:15.259 --> 01:29:17.663
I want you to be
my Cleopatra.

01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:21.532
Okay!

01:29:29.007 --> 01:29:31.640
Welcome. Please, please
take your seats.

01:29:31.642 --> 01:29:34.277
Ha ha!
There you are, Calhoun.

01:29:34.279 --> 01:29:37.579
- This is amazing.
- It's great to have you.

01:29:37.581 --> 01:29:40.716
BENJAMIN: Thank you.
Please take your seat. Yes, yes.

01:29:40.718 --> 01:29:42.287
WOMAN: It's great to be here.

01:29:43.855 --> 01:29:46.657
[audience applauding]

01:29:49.526 --> 01:29:51.797
[applause continues]

01:29:54.365 --> 01:29:57.399
Beatrice? Beatrice.

01:29:57.401 --> 01:29:59.702
I don't think I can do it.

01:29:59.704 --> 01:30:02.671
Relax, Everything is arranged.

01:30:02.673 --> 01:30:04.939
I don't want to hear another
word out of that pretty mouth

01:30:04.941 --> 01:30:08.778
until I hear you say,
"Call me, Ishmael."

01:30:08.780 --> 01:30:09.979
Yes?

01:30:09.981 --> 01:30:12.381
MR. FRY: Hello, young lady.

01:30:12.383 --> 01:30:14.382
This your first time
in the theater?

01:30:14.384 --> 01:30:15.717
Yes, sir.

01:30:15.719 --> 01:30:18.386
We do not frequent
these types of events.

01:30:18.388 --> 01:30:21.690
- We're churchgoing folk.
- Ah.

01:30:21.692 --> 01:30:24.862
Well, the theater is my church.

01:30:28.499 --> 01:30:31.536
It's like magic.
You'll see.

01:30:37.542 --> 01:30:39.375
Oh, my God.

01:30:39.377 --> 01:30:41.844
What is this
that shoots through me?

01:30:41.846 --> 01:30:44.512
All my past
has somehow grown dim.

01:30:44.514 --> 01:30:47.350
Is my journey's end coming?

01:30:47.352 --> 01:30:50.086
The grand god reveals himself!

01:30:50.088 --> 01:30:54.724
Aye! Reach your last
to the sun, Moby Dick!

01:30:54.726 --> 01:30:59.694
Thy hour and thy harpoon
are at hand!

01:30:59.696 --> 01:31:04.433
For hate's sake,
I spit my last breath at thee!

01:31:04.435 --> 01:31:08.436
From hell's heart,
I stab at thee!

01:31:08.438 --> 01:31:10.939
PHOEBE: The spear is darted!
Ahab's line runs foul.

01:31:10.941 --> 01:31:12.377
It's caught around his neck!

01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:17.011
The whale wheels around,

01:31:17.013 --> 01:31:19.517
bears down the <i>Pequod's</i>
advancing prow.

01:31:22.053 --> 01:31:25.921
All is set. Mr. Fry's carriage
awaits in the back alley.

01:31:25.923 --> 01:31:27.790
I'm going to go check
on Rebecca again.

01:31:27.792 --> 01:31:28.794
Okay.

01:31:35.732 --> 01:31:37.733
Think you can escape now, huh?

01:31:37.735 --> 01:31:41.670
Don't you know?
They all think you're mad.

01:31:41.672 --> 01:31:43.939
You'll never leave.
No, no, no.

01:31:43.941 --> 01:31:46.609
You're going to stay here
with me until you die.

01:31:46.611 --> 01:31:48.013
Let go of her!

01:32:02.125 --> 01:32:05.096
The whale!
My God, stand by me now!

01:32:22.213 --> 01:32:24.983
Water pours from
the breach in our side.

01:32:26.217 --> 01:32:27.786
We are doomed.

01:32:31.121 --> 01:32:34.825
[panting]

01:32:44.502 --> 01:32:45.837
BEATRICE: I did it.

01:32:52.477 --> 01:32:54.577
I did it.

01:32:54.579 --> 01:32:56.681
You can still go.

01:32:58.548 --> 01:32:59.917
Isabel, help me.

01:33:01.785 --> 01:33:04.086
Isabel, grab his leg.

01:33:04.088 --> 01:33:05.424
Okay.

01:33:07.892 --> 01:33:10.059
- Arms on three.
- Okay.

01:33:10.061 --> 01:33:12.060
Ready? One, two...

01:33:12.062 --> 01:33:15.933
[audience whispering]

01:33:24.575 --> 01:33:25.975
You're supposed to be
on stage. Go.

01:33:25.977 --> 01:33:26.975
No.

01:33:26.977 --> 01:33:29.110
Go. Finish the play.

01:33:29.112 --> 01:33:32.883
Isabel, if you don't go now,
they'll know something's wrong.

01:33:38.623 --> 01:33:41.593
[audience murmuring]

01:33:52.236 --> 01:33:54.239
The drama is done.

01:33:58.075 --> 01:34:00.579
Why then does one step forth?

01:34:01.978 --> 01:34:04.712
Because one did survive
the wreck.

01:34:04.714 --> 01:34:08.216
- Take the coffin. Steady.
- All the crew, were carried out of sight

01:34:08.218 --> 01:34:10.219
- Go, go.
- to the depths of the ocean.

01:34:10.221 --> 01:34:13.822
Floating on the margin
and in sight of the wreck,

01:34:13.824 --> 01:34:17.795
I was slowly drawn
towards the vortex.

01:34:21.264 --> 01:34:23.098
Queequeg's coffin!

01:34:23.100 --> 01:34:25.833
I grasped onto it...

01:34:25.835 --> 01:34:30.641
and was buoyed up by that coffin
for one day and one night.

01:34:33.878 --> 01:34:36.045
On the second day,
a sail drew near

01:34:36.047 --> 01:34:38.913
and picked me up at last.

01:34:38.915 --> 01:34:42.987
Then the great shroud of the sea
rolled on...

01:34:46.624 --> 01:34:50.529
as it has rolled on
for 5,000 years.

01:34:55.031 --> 01:34:59.835
[cheering]

01:34:59.837 --> 01:35:02.741

01:35:06.209 --> 01:35:08.377
Enjoy your moment.

01:35:08.379 --> 01:35:10.315
You earned it.

01:36:16.946 --> 01:36:19.081

01:36:19.083 --> 01:36:21.250

Mother!

01:36:21.252 --> 01:36:22.951
- No!
- Mother! Mother!

01:36:22.953 --> 01:36:25.056
Let the girl
be with her mother.

01:36:26.289 --> 01:36:27.658
TOBIAS: Rebecca!

01:36:44.340 --> 01:36:47.078

01:36:51.147 --> 01:36:52.350
Go.

01:36:57.887 --> 01:36:59.757
Hey! Hey, get back here!

01:37:07.164 --> 01:37:09.398
[audience gasps]

01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:11.500
I did it! I killed him!

01:37:11.502 --> 01:37:14.002
He deserved to die!

01:37:14.004 --> 01:37:15.369
TOBIAS: Hey, hey!

01:37:15.371 --> 01:37:17.271
- To arms, ladies!
- Yes!

01:37:17.273 --> 01:37:19.207
TOBIAS: Rebecca! Rebecca!

01:37:19.209 --> 01:37:20.375
Where is he?

01:37:20.377 --> 01:37:22.080
Rebecca, I said get back...

01:37:25.014 --> 01:37:27.052
[audience screaming]

01:37:29.018 --> 01:37:30.254
Hey!

01:37:33.891 --> 01:37:36.024
Cocksucker! Cunt!

01:37:36.026 --> 01:37:37.192
[screaming]

01:37:37.194 --> 01:37:38.396
Let go!

01:37:43.433 --> 01:37:46.771
Beatrice, what have you done?

01:37:50.273 --> 01:37:53.178
To the docks.
Mr. Fry's boat.

01:37:55.245 --> 01:37:56.244
Thank you.

01:37:56.246 --> 01:37:57.949
[horse neighs]

01:38:00.183 --> 01:38:02.486
I got to die on stage.

01:38:04.254 --> 01:38:07.491
Beatrice.
Oh, Beatrice.

01:38:19.102 --> 01:38:22.037
Where are we going, Mother?

01:38:22.039 --> 01:38:26.375
Out to sea,
like the men in the play.

01:38:26.377 --> 01:38:28.946
Will there be a whale?

01:38:31.115 --> 01:38:32.851
I doubt it.

01:38:34.517 --> 01:38:38.186
Everyone says you're mad.

01:38:38.188 --> 01:38:41.256
Are you?

01:38:41.258 --> 01:38:42.460
Look at me.

01:38:45.161 --> 01:38:49.967
When everyone says something,
it doesn't always make it true.

01:38:57.907 --> 01:38:59.777
I don't think you're mad.
