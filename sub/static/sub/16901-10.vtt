WEBVTT

00:04.337 --> 00:05.895
Mr. Donaghy will be a moment.

00:06.039 --> 00:07.438
He's finishing up
with the Germans.

00:07.574 --> 00:08.598
The Germans?

00:08.742 --> 00:11.040
Huh. Weird that he didn't
tell either of you.

00:11.177 --> 00:12.610
We're trying to buy
the largest cable network

00:12.746 --> 00:13.610
in Northern Europe.

00:13.747 --> 00:16.739
And if we do do that,
it'll be huge.

00:16.883 --> 00:18.817
What about
your huge doo-doo?

00:20.000 --> 00:26.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

00:27.160 --> 00:28.525
Sir,
your 11:00 is here.

00:28.661 --> 00:29.923
Excellent.
Lemon, come on in.

00:30.063 --> 00:31.587
Oh, no.
See your girlfriend first.

00:31.731 --> 00:32.459
Liz, please.

00:32.598 --> 00:34.066
Jack and I
have to have boundaries.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.565
I make appointments here
in New York.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.932
And I work around C. C.'s
schedule in Washington.

00:38.071 --> 00:40.562
Mr. Donaghy,
what are we doing this evening?

00:43.143 --> 00:46.078
There is an 8:00 showing
of "Fred Claus. "

00:46.212 --> 00:49.773
Okay. Well, you were gonna
help me go over my finances.

00:49.916 --> 00:52.316
So,
I have a checking account.

00:52.452 --> 00:55.216
I am two payments away
from owning my bike.

00:55.355 --> 00:58.222
Also, I have a star
that my aunt named after me.

00:58.358 --> 01:02.226
Although that was recently
downgraded to a gas giant.

01:02.362 --> 01:04.057
I booked Gladys Knight
onto the show.

01:04.197 --> 01:05.562
She's C. C.'s
favorite singer.

01:05.698 --> 01:06.790
Um, okay.

01:06.933 --> 01:09.527
And now
she's my favorite singer.

01:09.669 --> 01:11.159
Love, Lemon.

01:11.304 --> 01:13.772
Wanting someone to actually be
a part of your life,

01:13.907 --> 01:15.397
I've never had that before.

01:15.542 --> 01:18.511
Buy real estate. That's
the best investment there is.

01:18.645 --> 01:20.169
Real estate? No.
That's something you do

01:20.313 --> 01:21.746
when you're married
and you have a family.

01:21.881 --> 01:22.813
Sure. Wait for that.

01:22.949 --> 01:25.315
Your first home will be in the
floating city of New Chicago.

01:25.452 --> 01:27.511
Sir, your 11:10 is here.

01:27.654 --> 01:31.283
C. C., I'm terribly sorry.
That last meeting took forever.

01:49.843 --> 01:52.334
Okay, everybody.
Listen up.

01:52.479 --> 01:56.711
This cappuccino machine
is my way of saying sorry

01:56.850 --> 01:59.080
for what happened the other day.

02:00.887 --> 02:02.787
Tracy,
your father is here.

02:02.922 --> 02:04.446
My father?

02:04.591 --> 02:05.489
Aah!

02:05.625 --> 02:08.185
Okay.
That may have been a dream.

02:08.328 --> 02:10.387
Anyway, enjoy.

02:12.532 --> 02:13.396
Oh.

02:13.533 --> 02:14.557
Okay.

02:16.269 --> 02:19.500
Studio 6H.
This is Ken...

02:19.639 --> 02:23.166
Look at those floors.

02:23.309 --> 02:26.642
I would walk all around
inside of that.

02:26.779 --> 02:28.303
Hey!
What's up?

02:28.448 --> 02:29.608
Are you looking at porn?

02:29.749 --> 02:32.149
I know a good site that's dirty
without sacrificing story.

02:32.285 --> 02:34.014
It's by women for women.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.781
No.
I'm looking at real estate.

02:35.922 --> 02:38.117
Jack got it into my head
that I should buy something.

02:38.258 --> 02:39.418
You don't own any property?

02:39.559 --> 02:40.753
No.
Do you?

02:40.894 --> 02:43.294
I own my place here,
my condo in Clearwater,

02:43.429 --> 02:45.727
and I bought some land in
the Ninth Ward after Katrina.

02:45.865 --> 02:47.696
I'm leasing it back
to the government as a prison.

02:47.834 --> 02:48.766
Ka-ching.

02:48.902 --> 02:50.460
I got to get my act
together.

02:50.603 --> 02:52.503
Even Frank owns
that chicken ranch in Nevada.

02:52.639 --> 02:54.630
He thought he was buying
a whorehouse.

02:54.774 --> 02:57.038
Look, if you're serious,
I do have a lead.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.304
My business manager
says he needs cash fast,

02:59.445 --> 03:00.673
so he's selling
his apartment.

03:00.813 --> 03:02.041
It's gorgeous.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.274
Okay.
I'll check it out.

03:03.416 --> 03:04.678
You're going to love it.

03:04.817 --> 03:05.806
Oh, if you're interested,

03:05.952 --> 03:08.420
A. J.'s also selling a speed boat
and a truck full of cigarettes.

03:12.258 --> 03:15.159
<i>The machine is mankind's
madness and disfigurement.</i>

03:15.295 --> 03:16.956
<i>Industry castrates art.</i>

03:17.096 --> 03:18.654
<i>The only honesty is in suicide.</i>

03:18.798 --> 03:21.323
I can't watch any more
of these German sitcoms.

03:21.467 --> 03:23.458
Try a game show.

03:25.138 --> 03:26.162
Hello?

03:26.306 --> 03:28.900
I got your message.
I really can't come up tonight.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.475
I got a mountain of work
to do.

03:30.610 --> 03:32.635
But the president
is only going to veto

03:32.779 --> 03:33.837
your crazy social programs.

03:33.980 --> 03:35.948
The founding fathers
never intended for the poor

03:36.082 --> 03:36.980
to live into their 40s.

03:37.116 --> 03:37.741
Jack.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.249
I know it's my turn,
but I'm swamped

03:39.385 --> 03:40.579
with this
DeutscheTeleWelt stuff.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.348
If this is gonna work, we got
to meet each other halfway.

03:51.965 --> 03:53.227
Lemon, you speak German,
right?

03:53.366 --> 03:56.199
I do. I spent my junior year
abroad in Frankfurt.

03:56.336 --> 03:59.897
I partied so hard over there,
it was crazy.

04:06.045 --> 04:10.744
Well, I have to delegate
some important work to you.

04:10.883 --> 04:13.784
As part of the due diligence
for the DTW deal,

04:13.920 --> 04:15.353
I need you to watch
these German television shows

04:15.488 --> 04:17.115
and tell me what you think.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.120
Thank you.

04:18.257 --> 04:19.781
C. C. And I are trying to
meet halfway,

04:19.926 --> 04:23.089
which means balancing
work and love and life.

04:23.229 --> 04:25.254
I honestly don't know
how Kelly Ripa does it.

04:25.398 --> 04:26.296
Look at us.

04:26.432 --> 04:28.093
You and C. C.
Are meeting halfway.

04:28.234 --> 04:29.428
I'm going to see an apartment
later.

04:29.569 --> 04:32.402
And the community center
is going to stage my play!

04:32.538 --> 04:35.598
I have a thing that night.

04:41.281 --> 04:45.081
Mr. Jordan, I cannot work
with that machine at my desk.

04:45.218 --> 04:47.413
But you can have coffee
anytime you want.

04:47.553 --> 04:48.986
I don't drink coffee, sir.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.453
I don't drink hot liquids
of any kind.

04:50.590 --> 04:52.217
That's
the Devil's temperature.

04:52.358 --> 04:55.486
Ken, this is New York,
the Big Easy.

04:55.628 --> 04:56.925
Live a little!

04:57.063 --> 04:59.088
Boundaries are made
to be tested.

04:59.232 --> 05:02.099
That's why my wife and I
stopped using a "safe word. "

05:02.235 --> 05:04.169
But I don't want to do anything
I'll regret.

05:04.304 --> 05:07.899
Regrets are for horseshoes
and handbags.

05:17.450 --> 05:19.714
Oh, my.

05:24.590 --> 05:25.852
How was the apartment?

05:25.992 --> 05:28.426
It was incredible.

05:28.561 --> 05:31.962
<i>River views. New kitchens.
Party perfect.</i>

05:32.098 --> 05:32.962
<i>The Windmere.</i>

05:33.099 --> 05:34.794
<i>An oasis
from the vile obscenity</i>

05:34.934 --> 05:36.265
<i>of the human condition.</i>

05:36.402 --> 05:38.029
I made an offer,
and they accepted.

05:38.171 --> 05:38.933
What?

05:39.072 --> 05:41.597
I know. It's crazy.
I guess I have to get a loan?

05:41.741 --> 05:43.709
Call A. J.
But ask for Mike.

05:43.843 --> 05:46.175
I can't believe
you bought an apartment.

05:46.312 --> 05:47.244
Well, not yet.

05:47.380 --> 05:48.779
I still have to get approved
by the co-op board.

05:48.915 --> 05:50.712
Ugh, I'm all nervous.

05:50.850 --> 05:53.683
I have to dress up and smile
and try to get them to like me.

05:53.820 --> 05:55.947
It's gonna be like
going on a blind date.

05:56.089 --> 05:57.386
No, it's so much better.

05:57.523 --> 05:59.616
'Cause an apartment never waits
till you get in the shower

05:59.759 --> 06:01.556
then steals the necklace
your mother gave you.

06:02.962 --> 06:06.261
<i>The Windmere. If you lived
here, you'd be home now!</i>

06:07.600 --> 06:11.366
Hey, slow down there, Ken.

06:11.504 --> 06:14.496
Coffee's not like alcohol.
It's pretty addictive.

06:14.640 --> 06:16.232
I love how it makes me feel.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.504
It's like my heart
is trying to hug my brain.

06:19.645 --> 06:22.341
You know what we've never done,
Grizz?

06:22.482 --> 06:24.074
Fight each other!

06:24.217 --> 06:27.380
Whoa! Easy, Ken.

06:27.520 --> 06:31.889
You guys are my best friends!

06:42.969 --> 06:44.937
Jack,
what the hell is this?

06:45.071 --> 06:46.265
Why are we meeting here?

06:46.406 --> 06:48.033
You said you wanted me
to meet you halfway,

06:48.174 --> 06:50.369
and this betting parlor in the
Pennsylvania coal-mining country

06:50.510 --> 06:53.240
is exactly half the distance
between my office and yours.

06:53.379 --> 06:55.006
It's our special place.

06:55.148 --> 06:57.616
Well, technically, that corner
is exactly halfway,

06:57.750 --> 06:59.741
but I'm not going over there.

06:59.886 --> 07:01.786
All my life,
work came first.

07:01.921 --> 07:04.719
I missed so many weddings,
funerals, karate demonstrations.

07:04.857 --> 07:06.256
Birthdays, Lilith Fairs.

07:06.392 --> 07:07.290
But not anymore.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.019
You're my new night job.

07:09.162 --> 07:11.790
And I'm gonna love you
like my boss is watching.

07:11.931 --> 07:14.627
Say, what do you think they do
for fun around here?

07:14.767 --> 07:16.758
Smack around
nosy out-of-towners.

07:16.903 --> 07:19.497
Also, we have
a lovely doll museum.

07:21.874 --> 07:23.899
<i>Gladys Knight
to the stage, please.</i>

07:24.043 --> 07:26.807
Hey, Kenneth,
I need to watch these DVDs,

07:26.946 --> 07:28.277
but I have
a very important meeting.

07:28.414 --> 07:29.540
That's great!

07:29.682 --> 07:31.946
I've heard you speaking German
to some of your tours.

07:32.084 --> 07:32.709
Yes, sir.

07:32.852 --> 07:34.683
If you're not reading the Bible
in German,

07:34.821 --> 07:37.415
<i>you're not getting the real
versteckte bedeutung of it.</i>

07:37.557 --> 07:39.491
Okay, well, this is
very important. You are!

07:39.625 --> 07:43.117
I need you to watch these shows
and write a summary of each one.

07:43.262 --> 07:45.753
It's for Mr. Donaghy.
It has to be done by tomorrow.

07:45.898 --> 07:48.162
I am delegating it to you,
okay?

07:48.301 --> 07:49.393
Your last name is weird.

07:49.535 --> 07:51.901
Are you okay?

07:52.038 --> 07:53.505
Who wants coffee?!

07:56.809 --> 07:59.141
Let's do it.
Let's move here.

07:59.278 --> 08:00.802
We'll get a little cabin
in the woods.

08:00.947 --> 08:02.608
I'll plant
heirloom tomatoes.

08:02.748 --> 08:04.181
We'll ride our bikes
into town.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.511
I'll grow a beard.

08:05.651 --> 08:07.346
People from my old life
will pass through town,

08:07.487 --> 08:08.511
and they won't even
recognize me.

08:08.654 --> 08:10.622
They'll just say,
"Thanks, Pap,"

08:10.756 --> 08:12.314
and then they'll buy
some of my cider.

08:13.626 --> 08:15.958
Ah,
the real world calling.

08:22.134 --> 08:23.726
Oh, my God!

08:28.641 --> 08:31.633
I'm in love!

08:31.777 --> 08:32.937
God, I wish this town

08:33.078 --> 08:35.047
weren't halfway
between D. C. And New York.

08:38.317 --> 08:40.376
And I don't know
why I lied to you guys

08:40.520 --> 08:41.851
about having read that book.

08:41.988 --> 08:44.616
I'm just nervous.
Aah!

08:44.757 --> 08:48.386
Anyway, I didn't read
"The Lovely Bones. "

08:52.231 --> 08:54.290
This is empty.

08:54.433 --> 08:58.062
So, we have so much in common.

08:58.204 --> 08:59.694
Um...

08:59.839 --> 09:02.239
We're all white.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.040
Funny story.

09:05.177 --> 09:08.010
I was on a plane once
with Brett Favre's cousin.

09:08.147 --> 09:12.174
It says here that you still have
an outstanding student loan?

09:12.318 --> 09:14.411
Yes, it is outstanding.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.045
No. I can explain that.

09:17.189 --> 09:20.852
The theater program at my school
lost its accreditation,

09:20.993 --> 09:24.554
so I thought I didn't
have to pay for it anymore.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.935
Look, I didn't think I was ready
for this, but I am.

09:31.070 --> 09:34.938
There's this connection
that I feel to the apartment.

09:35.074 --> 09:37.804
And I am a great neighbor.

09:37.944 --> 09:40.378
Just ask anyone in my building.

09:40.513 --> 09:41.844
Except Raheem.

09:41.981 --> 09:45.280
I turned him in to
Homeland Security by accident.

09:46.752 --> 09:47.684
I love your building!

09:47.820 --> 09:50.050
There, I said it.

09:50.189 --> 09:51.554
Love!

09:51.691 --> 09:54.888
There's something
coming out of your nose.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.295
You missed Gladys Knight's
sound check.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.563
Did you know they replace
the Pips every five years

10:05.705 --> 10:06.569
just like Menudo?

10:06.706 --> 10:09.607
Oh, hey, how did the meeting
with the co-op board go?

10:09.742 --> 10:13.473
Good. Bad.
Really bad. But good.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.911
They said they were gonna let me
know. Should I call them?

10:16.048 --> 10:17.845
No! You have to wait
for them to call you.

10:17.984 --> 10:22.148
Yes, I'm going to play it cool.
That's what homeowners do.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.256
Act like adults.
Playing it cool.

10:24.390 --> 10:25.857
The Germans are here!

10:25.992 --> 10:27.254
I am going through something
right now!

10:27.393 --> 10:29.122
They're a day early.
Jack went to see C. C.

10:29.261 --> 10:31.320
And he hasn't come back yet and
he's not answering his phone.

10:31.464 --> 10:32.863
What? He's not?

10:32.999 --> 10:34.159
This deal
has to go through.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.699
Then Jack will be CEO,

10:35.835 --> 10:37.598
and I will be king
of the assistants!

10:37.737 --> 10:40.706
Please put on some decent
clothes and go talk to them.

10:40.840 --> 10:42.273
You're the only one who's seen
all of their shows.

10:43.676 --> 10:44.836
Where's Kenneth?

11:18.010 --> 11:21.070
I think
they're gonna walk.

11:30.156 --> 11:32.124
Super!

11:33.192 --> 11:34.181
What happened?

11:34.326 --> 11:36.726
I just bought
a German television studio.

11:36.862 --> 11:39.387
That's what I call
a country breakfast.

11:39.532 --> 11:40.590
I've never been to a place

11:40.733 --> 11:42.667
where they kill the pig
in front of you.

11:42.802 --> 11:43.996
It's so quaint.

11:44.136 --> 11:47.196
It's strange
we didn't get any ham.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.039
Morning shift change
at the mine.

11:50.176 --> 11:52.736
Oh, boy. We better get
back to work, too.

11:52.878 --> 11:55.574
God, I haven't thought
about work once this whole time.

11:55.715 --> 11:56.909
I know. It's weird.

11:57.049 --> 11:58.983
Good weird
or last-night weird?

12:00.986 --> 12:03.079
Good weird.
I'll see you tomorrow.

12:05.825 --> 12:10.057
<i>Love. A urine mirage
in a desert of fear.</i>

12:13.132 --> 12:14.463
What's happening?
Where are they taking her?

12:14.600 --> 12:17.763
I'm getting rid of the machine,
Ken, for your own good.

12:17.903 --> 12:19.803
No!
No, please don't do that.

12:19.939 --> 12:21.566
Come on.
I'll make you feel good.

12:21.707 --> 12:25.734
Get a grip.
Look at yourself.

12:25.878 --> 12:28.142
What's happened to me?

12:28.280 --> 12:29.577
You rode the brown serpent.

12:29.715 --> 12:32.650
But the important thing
is you survived, Ken.

12:32.785 --> 12:36.221
No. I made two promises
to my mother

12:36.355 --> 12:37.913
before I left
for New York.

12:38.057 --> 12:40.992
One, if I found any Mackenzies
living up here,

12:41.127 --> 12:41.991
I would kill them.

12:42.128 --> 12:45.825
And two, I would not let
this city change me.

12:45.965 --> 12:47.990
So you had a little bender.

12:48.134 --> 12:52.833
It's not just the coffee.
I also went to a PG-13 movie.

12:52.972 --> 12:55.770
I bought
a pair of sunglasses.

12:55.908 --> 12:58.342
I tried a Jewish doughnut.

12:58.477 --> 13:00.001
I'd always been told

13:00.146 --> 13:03.946
that New York was
the 21st-century city of Sodom.

13:04.083 --> 13:08.452
And look what's happened.
I've become one of them.

13:08.587 --> 13:11.215
I've been Sodomized.

13:15.327 --> 13:18.091
Hey, it's Liz Lemon.

13:18.230 --> 13:20.926
This message is
for the co-op board, I guess.

13:21.066 --> 13:22.556
This is the number you gave me.

13:22.701 --> 13:24.566
I hope it's not fake.

13:24.703 --> 13:28.537
'Cause you accepted my bid
and I haven't heard from you,

13:28.674 --> 13:31.006
but I'm doing great.

13:31.143 --> 13:34.840
I bought a German
television studio today.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.538
Does everyone know
that you're liars

13:36.682 --> 13:37.774
or should I tell them myself?

13:37.917 --> 13:39.509
Because I know a lot of people!

13:39.652 --> 13:40.983
You know what? I'm fine.

13:41.120 --> 13:43.645
Because I know who I am.

13:43.789 --> 13:47.225
You. I feel sorry for you,
co-op board.

13:47.359 --> 13:51.853
I am going to the hospital,
and I hope you're happy!

13:51.997 --> 13:53.897
I'm just confused.

13:54.033 --> 13:55.694
It seems weird to me

13:55.835 --> 13:57.962
that you would still be
advertising the apartment

13:58.103 --> 13:59.536
after you accepted my offer.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.503
And I'm here?

14:01.640 --> 14:03.972
To remind you?

14:04.109 --> 14:06.475
You know what?
I've moved on.

14:06.612 --> 14:09.342
I bought a whole bunch
of apartments.

14:09.481 --> 14:11.142
I bought a black apartment.

14:11.283 --> 14:12.580
So...

14:16.956 --> 14:18.617
Yes, sir, but I think if you...

14:24.830 --> 14:27.822
Lemon, how do you say
"buy" and "sell" in German?

14:27.967 --> 14:30.663
<i>Verkaufen and kaufen.</i>

14:30.803 --> 14:32.430
So close.

14:32.571 --> 14:34.004
Other way around.

14:34.139 --> 14:35.766
Yeah. I always got confused
by that.

14:38.077 --> 14:39.339
Blurgh!

14:39.478 --> 14:41.776
Yes. Blurgh.

14:41.914 --> 14:43.279
But it's a misunderstanding.

14:43.415 --> 14:45.406
I'll just tell Don Geiss
I let a subordinate

14:45.551 --> 14:47.280
with an unaccredited
theater-tech degree

14:47.419 --> 14:49.319
do a billion-dollar
handshake deal

14:49.455 --> 14:51.150
while my girlfriend and I
showered together

14:51.290 --> 14:52.188
at a Red Roof Inn.

14:52.324 --> 14:54.189
Oh, boy. I'm sorry.

14:54.326 --> 14:55.884
No, Lemon, it's my fault.
I lied to you.

14:56.028 --> 14:57.086
About what?

14:57.229 --> 14:59.754
All this time I've been telling
you that we can have it all.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.594
Success and happiness.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.725
The big office
and true love.

15:03.869 --> 15:05.393
Wait, we can't?
No.

15:05.537 --> 15:08.870
Because they both require
everything of you.

15:09.008 --> 15:10.100
You have to choose.

15:10.242 --> 15:12.142
So, which are you
gonna choose?

15:18.317 --> 15:21.047
Excuse me, could you turn off
the race announcer

15:21.186 --> 15:22.710
and put on some Gladys Knight?

15:22.855 --> 15:27.087
And what is
the champagne situation here?

15:27.226 --> 15:29.091
Okay, thank you.

15:31.363 --> 15:32.762
What are you still doing
in Washington?

15:32.898 --> 15:34.627
I can't come to Hockassin,
Jack.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.428
I'm afraid if I see you,
I'll change my mind.

15:36.568 --> 15:37.899
Change your mind about what?

15:38.037 --> 15:39.299
When I was with you
the other day,

15:39.438 --> 15:40.302
I missed the vote

15:40.439 --> 15:42.669
on a bill to legalize
recreational whale torture.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.802
We only have one speed,
Jack.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.436
That's what I love
about us.

15:48.580 --> 15:50.707
The drive. The ambition.

15:50.849 --> 15:53.613
Our belief that sex
is a competition.

15:53.752 --> 15:55.185
It's what we have
in common.

15:55.321 --> 15:57.482
And it's why it's
impossible to pull this off.

15:57.623 --> 15:59.887
No, no. You're wrong.
It is possible.

16:00.025 --> 16:01.959
I know we can't do all of this
at full speed.

16:02.094 --> 16:03.618
We have to choose.

16:03.762 --> 16:04.751
And I choose you.

16:04.897 --> 16:05.693
Oh, Jack.

16:05.831 --> 16:06.661
Oh, come on.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.824
Get in that ridiculous
electric car of yours

16:08.968 --> 16:09.832
and get up here.

16:09.969 --> 16:13.166
Look, we are both at a place
in our lives right now

16:13.305 --> 16:15.102
where we can't...

16:15.240 --> 16:16.867
And that's not
all that matters.

16:17.009 --> 16:20.877
When I was a kid, I was raised
in a pretty religious household

16:21.013 --> 16:22.139
and I remember...

16:24.750 --> 16:26.684
I think it goes back
to my mother's mother.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.686
She was in a loveless marriage
for 40 years

16:29.822 --> 16:33.314
before she realized
she didn't want children.

16:33.459 --> 16:36.155
Yes, sir?

16:36.295 --> 16:38.456
I agree.

16:38.597 --> 16:41.964
If we look
at the larger trend...

16:42.101 --> 16:44.160
I'll have it for you
first thing in the morning.

16:44.303 --> 16:46.794
Thank you.

16:46.939 --> 16:49.635
...children.
So, do you agree or not?

16:49.775 --> 16:52.073
Oh, boy.

16:52.211 --> 16:54.145
Uh,
when you think about it,

16:54.279 --> 16:56.304
there's really no answer.

16:56.448 --> 16:58.348
Did you take another call
while I was talking?

16:59.818 --> 17:03.345
Yes, but never forgetting
that you were on the other line.

17:03.489 --> 17:05.820
For whatever it's worth, C. C.,
I do love you.

17:05.958 --> 17:09.189
Me too.
But we can't do this.

17:09.328 --> 17:11.319
Maybe in another life,
we'll get it right.

17:11.463 --> 17:15.455
Sure.
In another life.

17:23.342 --> 17:25.674
Thanks, pal.

17:31.517 --> 17:33.712
Mr. Jordan,
I just wanted to thank you

17:33.852 --> 17:35.046
for everything
that you've done for me.

17:35.187 --> 17:36.518
It's been an honor
being your friend

17:36.655 --> 17:38.885
and learning about
the non-reproductive aspects

17:39.024 --> 17:41.151
of human sexuality from you.

17:41.293 --> 17:42.885
But this is goodbye.

17:43.028 --> 17:47.522
I let my mama down,
and I'm going back to Georgia.

17:47.666 --> 17:50.226
What?
No, you can't leave, Ken.

17:50.369 --> 17:52.997
Who's going to help me
tell white people apart?

17:53.138 --> 17:54.901
And what about our tickets
to "Spamalot"?

17:55.040 --> 17:57.565
Who will be my wingman
at speed-dating?

17:57.709 --> 18:01.110
Oh, Grizz.
I'll miss you most of all.

18:10.155 --> 18:13.420
New York, mm?

18:13.559 --> 18:16.460
Proved too much
for the man?

18:16.595 --> 18:18.358
Too much for the man?

18:18.497 --> 18:20.055
He couldn't make it?

18:20.199 --> 18:23.293
So he's leaving the life?

18:23.435 --> 18:26.495
He's come to know?

18:26.638 --> 18:27.969
He's leaving?

18:28.107 --> 18:29.972
Leaving?

18:30.109 --> 18:32.168
On that midnight train
to Georgia?

18:32.311 --> 18:34.211
Leaving
on a midnight train?

18:34.346 --> 18:36.007
Wow, wow?

18:41.487 --> 18:42.454
Liz.

18:42.588 --> 18:43.987
The board.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.249
Hi.

18:45.390 --> 18:46.948
You look good.

18:47.092 --> 18:48.354
Thank you.
So do you.

18:48.494 --> 18:51.622
Liz, this is Charlotte.

18:51.763 --> 18:54.789
She's buying the apartment.

18:54.933 --> 18:55.797
Congratulations.

18:55.934 --> 18:58.300
If you blow out
the kitchen wall,

18:58.437 --> 19:00.166
you could make
a very nice breakfast nook.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.609
Yes, he's leaving?

19:08.747 --> 19:12.274
Yes, he's leaving?

19:12.417 --> 19:14.681
On that midnight train
to Georgia?

19:14.820 --> 19:17.653
Leaving
on a midnight train?

19:17.789 --> 19:19.222
Yeah, yeah?

19:19.358 --> 19:21.826
<i>And you shouldn't
torture whales.</i>

19:21.960 --> 19:24.224
I'm sorry about C. C.

19:24.363 --> 19:26.058
Thanks, Lemon.

19:26.198 --> 19:27.392
Want to get drunk?

19:27.533 --> 19:30.093
No. There's too many phones
in here.

19:32.671 --> 19:34.036
You should have gone for it,
you know.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.368
You made the same choice
that C. C. And I did.

19:36.508 --> 19:37.998
You chose your career
over Floyd.

19:39.912 --> 19:42.005
My world, her world?

19:42.147 --> 19:43.341
His world, our world?

19:43.482 --> 19:44.676
Mine and hers alone?
Mine and his alone?

19:44.816 --> 19:47.376
I've got to go,
I've got to go?

19:47.519 --> 19:50.044
On that midnight train?

19:50.189 --> 19:51.315
All aboard?

19:51.456 --> 19:52.445
All aboard?

19:52.591 --> 19:54.491
All aboard
on that midnight train?

19:54.626 --> 19:55.854
I missed it?

19:55.994 --> 19:57.359
He missed it?

19:57.496 --> 20:00.363
I missed that midnight train
to Georgia?

20:00.499 --> 20:03.593
He missed
that midnight train?

20:03.735 --> 20:04.599
Whoo-whoo?

20:04.736 --> 20:06.670
There's an 11:45?

20:06.805 --> 20:10.400
And I was misinformed
about the time?

20:10.542 --> 20:12.476
Misinformed
about the time?

20:12.611 --> 20:14.545
Didn't even get to stand
in line?

20:14.680 --> 20:16.238
Yeah, I missed it?

20:16.381 --> 20:21.216
He missed
the midnight train?

20:21.353 --> 20:26.814
To Georgia?

20:26.959 --> 20:30.258
Hello!
I'm trying to take a nap!

20:30.395 --> 20:32.590
What's going on out here?

20:32.731 --> 20:33.857
Nothing, Gladys Knight.

20:33.999 --> 20:36.058
Sorry.

20:36.201 --> 20:38.465
Sorry, everyone.
