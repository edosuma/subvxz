So the lyrics
really didn't say much.

23:24.936 --> 23:27.572
They kind of was like, you know,
"We're friends forever."

23:27.639 --> 23:29.541
Yeah, it's kind of,
that got--

23:29.608 --> 23:31.276

a little bit of a struggle,

the fun that you were having.

23:43.822 --> 23:45.490
Vanessa, what did you think
of this duet?

23:45.557 --> 23:48.326
Well, denim is tough
to make glamorous.

23:48.393 --> 23:52.697
So, you guys did a beautiful
job tonight and chemistry wise,

23:52.764 --> 23:54.466
why was it a good mix?

23:54.533 --> 23:57.269
I really found on La Voix

23:57.335 --> 23:59.905
some similarities with me

23:59.971 --> 24:03.074
and everything flows like...
really good.

24:03.141 --> 24:04.876
We've got the European
connection as well.

24:04.943 --> 24:07.712

the Americans can be scary.

and this kind of lyric,

I would have loved
to have seen more depth,

24:21.326 --> 24:22.928
more connection to your souls.

24:22.994 --> 24:25.964
But I really commend you
for coming out here

24:26.031 --> 24:28.834
and doing this together
and pushing each other.

24:28.900 --> 24:29.935

I bet it's really exciting to
have your husband here tonight.

24:40.745 --> 24:41.947

24:42.013 --> 24:43.315

were on the pole earlier.

I have to say,
I think denim is difficult.

24:49.387 --> 24:51.022
Blue lips are even
sometimes difficult

24:51.089 --> 24:52.724
and you both look beautiful.

24:52.791 --> 24:54.659
It's very giving like

We are both
powerhouse vocalists.

26:00.425 --> 26:02.127
So I think it's going
to be a really fun

26:02.193 --> 26:04.496

26:04.562 --> 26:06.498
Ada's going with me.
We are a pair.

26:06.564 --> 26:08.500
Ada and I picked each other

26:08.566 --> 26:10.969
because we both knew
we'd make good music.

26:11.736 --> 26:14.472
Our theme is
"Back Off Bitch."

26:14.539 --> 26:17.542
It's about being
exactly who you are

26:17.609 --> 26:20.145
and not giving a fuck
what people think about it.

26:22.047 --> 26:24.115
You know, it's so interesting
with these pairings

26:24.182 --> 26:26.017
and with the matching them
with the song

26:26.084 --> 26:28.987
is this song I think is really
great for both of your voices.

26:29.054 --> 26:31.423
Musically, I think
we kind of think alike.

26:31.489 --> 26:32.791
Amazing.

26:32.857 --> 26:35.727
So in the very first
kind of section,

26:35.794 --> 26:38.163
-I want to start it off right.
-You wanna open with a bang.

26:38.229 --> 26:40.298
Because we want to make it feel
good right from the beginning.

26:40.365 --> 26:42.434
Ada is my biggest
competition here.

26:43.668 --> 26:45.370
It will push me vocally,

26:45.437 --> 26:48.206
and it'll also help me learn
some things about her

26:48.273 --> 26:50.008
that could probably
help me beat her.

26:56.314 --> 26:57.816

26:57.882 --> 26:59.818

26:59.884 --> 27:01.886
of myself and Aria
when we're in our zones.

27:02.354 --> 27:04.756
Aria has that fuller,

27:04.823 --> 27:06.725
huskier, soulful voice.

27:06.791 --> 27:09.728
So when we sing
against each other

27:09.794 --> 27:11.596
in this kind of like
battle section

27:11.663 --> 27:14.299
that we have going on,
it is incredible.

27:14.366 --> 27:16.167
You're not trying
to out sing each other.

27:16.234 --> 27:18.370
You're trying to make space
for each other to shine.

27:18.436 --> 27:22.040
We try to make a special
effort not to do that.

27:22.707 --> 27:25.143
There is a small
section in the song

27:25.210 --> 27:26.811
where we just
kind of go for it,

27:26.878 --> 27:28.313
let loose and go crazy.

And I do see how that
could be a bit of an issue,

27:32.050 --> 27:34.119
but we're just going
to go with it

27:34.185 --> 27:35.387

it turns out great.

we really needed this space

27:41.259 --> 27:43.094
to move on in our careers

27:43.161 --> 27:46.698
because you're trying
to move on from pageantry.

27:46.765 --> 27:49.067
Yeah, I really
want to be done.

27:49.134 --> 27:52.370
Now, you're going to do music
and focus on that, more or less.

27:52.437 --> 27:53.805
And me,
I'm trying to move on

27:53.872 --> 27:56.174

from my last situation.

27:56.241 --> 27:58.576

we have two vocal powerhouses,

28:09.721 --> 28:11.856

Leona, you were on your feet
during the song.

31:14.138 --> 31:17.308
I was waiting for a vocal
moment and this was it.

31:17.375 --> 31:19.143

31:21.479 --> 31:23.881
I just loved
your energy as well,

31:23.948 --> 31:27.485
like both of you were like
competing against each other.

31:27.552 --> 31:30.121
And I loved that
it just drove you both more

31:30.188 --> 31:31.956
to give us
such a great performance.

31:32.023 --> 31:33.625
So I really appreciated that.

31:35.126 --> 31:37.528
All right. Let's find out
what Trixie thought.

31:37.595 --> 31:39.998
Ada, your singing
is so effortless at times,

31:40.064 --> 31:41.266
it's like,
"Is she lip synching?"

31:41.332 --> 31:43.468
It's almost
how like perfect it is.

31:43.534 --> 31:46.304
And Aria, I got to say
the commitment in your eyes.

31:46.371 --> 31:48.339
I believe that
you wanted that man.

31:48.406 --> 31:50.908
Unfortunately,
he's mine, but...

31:50.975 --> 31:52.443

-I've ever seen.
-Thank you.

32:00.018 --> 32:01.519

32:01.586 --> 32:03.454

illusions I've seen.

32:03.521 --> 32:05.290
[laughing]

32:07.659 --> 32:09.160
This is something
totally weird for me,

32:09.227 --> 32:10.695

wear this, you know?

32:10.762 --> 32:12.530
This is the first time
you all are figuring out

32:12.597 --> 32:13.831
that I have legs.

32:13.898 --> 32:15.466
I want to cover
because I'm insecure.

32:15.533 --> 32:17.235
-No, bitch, they're perfect.
-You have great legs.

32:17.302 --> 32:18.870
Don't do that to yourself.

let's talk about
the elephant in the room. Me.

33:33.378 --> 33:34.846
Yes, my character, Mina,

33:34.912 --> 33:37.448
is a shy but incredibly
talented elephant,

33:37.515 --> 33:39.817
and she knows a thing or two
about the experience

33:39.884 --> 33:41.319
you're all going through.

33:41.386 --> 33:44.222
You have the opportunity
to perform on a massive stage

33:44.288 --> 33:45.723
and do the thing you love.

33:45.790 --> 33:48.259
But you're also faced
with the fear of rejection.

33:48.326 --> 33:49.460
Totally.

33:49.527 --> 33:51.562
You just have to
remember one thing:

33:51.629 --> 33:53.831
you deserve to be on that stage.

33:54.565 --> 33:56.234
You put yourself out there.

33:56.300 --> 33:58.469
You've shared your gifts
and your voice with the world.

33:58.536 --> 34:01.939
And that's something to be
so proud of, win or lose.

34:03.274 --> 34:04.909
Although,
let's be real,

34:04.976 --> 34:06.544
winning would be
pretty nice, too.

I can't wait to see
what lies ahead for all of you,

GRAHAM: Leona Winter,
everybody!

42:54.705 --> 42:56.707
Well done, Leona.

42:57.608 --> 42:58.776
Give each other a hug.

42:58.842 --> 43:00.377
How do you feel
after that, Leona?

43:01.512 --> 43:03.113
Tired. [laughing]

43:03.180 --> 43:06.050
No, I feel okay,
but I've met

43:06.116 --> 43:10.321
a so beautiful person
in you and I...

43:10.387 --> 43:12.656
I really did
want this happen.

43:13.190 --> 43:16.026
May the best
stay in the competition.

43:16.093 --> 43:17.494
That's all.

43:17.561 --> 43:19.296
Well said, Leona.

43:21.298 --> 43:23.934
You've both done
all you can.

43:24.835 --> 43:27.671
Pop diva panel,
if you'd like to confer, please.

43:27.738 --> 43:31.275
[tense music]

43:48.792 --> 43:50.728
Panel, it's decision time.

43:54.598 --> 43:55.733
Leona?

43:55.799 --> 43:57.901
La Voix, Leona.

43:57.968 --> 43:59.903
You gave your absolute

43:59.970 --> 44:02.172
all in those performances,

44:02.239 --> 44:05.743
but one of you shone
just a little bit brighter.

44:07.978 --> 44:12.016
So the queen moving forward
in the competition is...

44:12.082 --> 44:14.118
♪♪♪
