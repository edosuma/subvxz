WEBVTT

01:43.886 --> 01:45.453
- Quiet down, boy.

01:50.197 --> 01:50.936
I said--

01:52.851 --> 01:55.202
That kind still won't sleep?

01:56.290 --> 01:57.682
I'm gonna show you what happens

01:57.726 --> 01:59.771
when you boys don't keep quiet.

02:02.383 --> 02:03.906
Get back in your rooms, now!

02:15.352 --> 02:18.094
I told you to get to sleep.

02:19.443 --> 02:21.445
I don't care if you can't.

02:24.448 --> 02:25.232
The hell?

02:27.408 --> 02:29.540
I'll make you sleep, boy.

02:31.499 --> 02:32.674
- Leave him alone!

03:04.401 --> 03:05.185
- Cody?

03:06.838 --> 03:08.579
- That is not my name.

03:13.062 --> 03:14.585
- No don't.

03:47.270 --> 03:48.706
-  To the
purely physiological,

03:48.750 --> 03:51.709
like apnea and narcolepsy,or Kleine Levins.

03:51.753 --> 03:55.060
Kleine Levin mainly
affects teenage boys.

03:55.104 --> 03:56.758
Anyone know the symptoms?

03:56.801 --> 03:58.238
- Are you even listening?

03:58.281 --> 03:59.848
- Your foster
uncle's elaborating

03:59.891 --> 04:02.807
on peculiar brain functionduring Kleine Levin syndrome.

04:02.851 --> 04:04.113
Yeah, child's play.

04:06.985 --> 04:08.726
You didn't sleep
again last night?

04:09.901 --> 04:11.642
Karla, it's not good for you.

04:11.686 --> 04:13.296
- You have late nights, too.

04:13.340 --> 04:15.516
- Yeah, but look at
what I've been reading.

04:15.559 --> 04:17.082
There is a Javanese demon,

04:17.126 --> 04:19.171
which if you give it your soulwill make you rich overnight,

04:19.215 --> 04:21.086
but will turn you
into a wild boar.

04:22.697 --> 04:24.351
What?

04:24.394 --> 04:25.656
- Really?

04:25.700 --> 04:26.788
- People in Indonesia
have seen these things,

04:26.831 --> 04:28.790
there have been
documented reports.

04:28.833 --> 04:30.792
- There are some
sleeping disorders

04:30.835 --> 04:32.141
that are so rare they only occur

04:32.184 --> 04:34.099
in a handful of the
world's population.

04:35.100 --> 04:38.060
Fatal Familial Insomnia,

04:38.103 --> 04:41.542
FFI affects 40
families, worldwide.

04:41.585 --> 04:46.503
Put simply, FFI prevents youfrom sleeping, until you die.

04:46.547 --> 04:48.723
It's genetic, but random.

04:48.766 --> 04:50.290
As the condition progresses,

04:50.333 --> 04:54.685
the patient is unable
to reach any REM sleep.

04:54.729 --> 04:57.819
In its final stages,
the brain atrophies.

04:57.862 --> 04:59.908
The patient becomes catatonic,

04:59.951 --> 05:01.301
then organ failure,

05:02.780 --> 05:03.825
and then death.

05:05.827 --> 05:08.264
There are cases where
chronic insomniacs,

05:08.308 --> 05:12.399
like an FFI patient, canbecome extremely unstable,

05:12.442 --> 05:13.313
dangerous even.

05:14.139 --> 05:15.445
Take this man, for example.

05:15.489 --> 05:17.926
Now he went without
sleep for about 30 days.

05:17.969 --> 05:20.320
He was extremely paranoid,

05:20.363 --> 05:21.146
delusional.

05:22.670 --> 05:26.630
Finally, his wife and childwere found dead, murdered.

05:27.892 --> 05:29.981
Some people want to link
satanism to this guy,

05:30.025 --> 05:32.767
claim it's evidence
of demonic possession,

05:32.810 --> 05:33.594
but not me.

05:34.769 --> 05:37.206
We stick to medicine
in this class.

05:37.249 --> 05:39.382
And that's it for today,
you've been great.

05:39.426 --> 05:41.950
There might be a quiz
next week on FFI,

05:41.993 --> 05:43.647
Kleine Levin.- Catch up with you later.

05:43.691 --> 05:46.258
-  And
their associated
physiological effects.

05:46.302 --> 05:48.913
- I'm sorry, all we can do now

05:48.957 --> 05:50.611
is make your
brother comfortable.

05:50.654 --> 05:51.916
- No, I can't accept that.

05:52.830 --> 05:54.528
There's still plenty of options.

05:54.571 --> 05:57.139
- You can see, he's
steadily declining.

05:57.182 --> 06:00.838
His energy levels are constantlyfluctuating, Miss Dawson.

06:00.882 --> 06:02.536
Without sleep for
this long it's just--

06:02.579 --> 06:06.148
- Look, in 2008, Mexican
doctors ran a drug trial

06:06.191 --> 06:08.759
that directly provoked thelapsed prion 23 in the brain

06:08.803 --> 06:11.632
to start rebuilding
proper sleep chemistry.

06:11.675 --> 06:13.938
The patient actually
slept for a whole hour.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.725
Now, I know it's not legalhere, but we need to start--

06:17.768 --> 06:19.422
- But what happened after that?

06:19.466 --> 06:20.684
Did the patient recover?

06:21.903 --> 06:23.687
- You're still only
a student, Karla.

06:23.731 --> 06:26.168
You need to trust
our experience.

06:26.211 --> 06:29.389
Since your parents died,especially the way they did,

06:29.432 --> 06:31.695
Blake's never had a normal life.

06:31.739 --> 06:33.871
We always knew this
day would come.

06:33.915 --> 06:36.700
We can't do anything
more for Blake here.

06:36.744 --> 06:39.834
It's better he's at home inthese final stages, anyway.

06:39.877 --> 06:40.791
I'm sorry.

06:42.837 --> 06:45.187
- If you send him home,he doesn't have a chance.

06:46.667 --> 06:49.191
- It can help to
talk to someone.

06:49.234 --> 06:51.802
I could ask the chaplain tocome down, he is a good man.

06:51.846 --> 06:53.848
- Faith isn't gonna
help my brother.

06:54.849 --> 06:55.893
Excuse me.

07:03.074 --> 07:03.858
- Hey, KJ.

07:05.947 --> 07:06.730
- Hey.

07:13.084 --> 07:15.391
- They are pulling me out,

07:15.435 --> 07:16.218
aren't they?

07:28.448 --> 07:30.841
I just need a goodnight's rest, that's all.

07:34.192 --> 07:35.890
I've gotta practise
counting sheep.

07:41.896 --> 07:42.636
- Hey Blake.

07:44.551 --> 07:45.334
- Hey Pat.

07:46.901 --> 07:48.903
- Hey.

07:48.946 --> 07:50.774
- Hi.

07:50.818 --> 07:53.908
Blake, I have things to do,so I will see you later.

08:00.523 --> 08:01.916
- So, how's today?

08:03.047 --> 08:04.832
- Yeah, fine.

08:04.875 --> 08:06.921
Just I don't think
we're gonna be

08:06.964 --> 08:09.750
smoking buddies
again any time soon.

08:09.793 --> 08:11.969
- It's too late, I've quit.

08:12.796 --> 08:13.928
- Yeah, right.

08:16.887 --> 08:19.020
Oh yeah, and it's working.

08:19.063 --> 08:20.935
- As long as you
keep munching, yeah.

08:22.632 --> 08:24.025
- Okay.

08:24.068 --> 08:25.853
All right, deal up, let's go.

08:25.896 --> 08:27.724
- Seven.- Let's do it, all right.

08:32.642 --> 08:34.122
-  To give Blakethe treatment he needs,

08:34.165 --> 08:35.689
we have to take him somewherewe can't be observed.

08:35.732 --> 08:36.907
-  No, it's
too dangerous,

08:36.951 --> 08:37.952
we need to petition
the hospital.

08:37.995 --> 08:39.083
- Blake doesn't
have time for that.

08:39.127 --> 08:40.128
- What if he has a seizure,

08:40.171 --> 08:41.042
and we don't have
the right staff?

08:41.085 --> 08:42.913
Or the right drugs?

08:42.957 --> 08:44.349
I've never even seen this place.

08:44.393 --> 08:46.700
- It's been used for thiskind of treatment before.

08:46.743 --> 08:48.223
Remember when I told
you that your dad

08:48.266 --> 08:51.574
took your mom to a
special facility.

08:51.618 --> 08:53.054
- Yeah.

08:53.097 --> 08:55.317
- Yeah, well I haven't beencompletely honest with you.

08:55.360 --> 08:58.973
It's an abandoned basementhere on this campus.

08:59.016 --> 09:00.061
- What?

09:02.367 --> 09:04.021
- It was the only
way we could conceal

09:04.065 --> 09:05.545
those kind of drug trials.

09:07.198 --> 09:10.071
I have two patients down thereright now, who I'm treating.

09:11.202 --> 09:12.813
For those two people,
just like Blake,

09:14.118 --> 09:15.076
it's this, or death.

09:18.209 --> 09:19.210
Without proper care,

09:20.734 --> 09:22.126
Blake won't last the week.

09:24.346 --> 09:26.609
Wouldn't you do anything
you can to save him?

10:15.049 --> 10:16.137
- I just heard.

10:20.184 --> 10:21.446
Rob's right.

10:21.490 --> 10:23.100
You know if we can't
work inside the system

10:23.144 --> 10:25.189
then we're gonna have
to get outside of it.

10:26.234 --> 10:27.931
- He didn't exactly invite you.

10:29.150 --> 10:31.108
- You're gonna need
my help, Karla.

10:31.152 --> 10:32.283
And if Rob's got
an issue with me,

10:32.327 --> 10:34.285
then he's just gonna
have to live with it.

10:36.897 --> 10:38.072
You can do this.

10:39.247 --> 10:39.987
It's gonna work.

10:51.607 --> 10:53.522
I'm just gonna grab his chart.

10:53.565 --> 10:54.305
- Yeah.

11:07.405 --> 11:10.800
-  I don't know,
she's come around.

11:12.019 --> 11:15.805
-  As you leave
every morning.

11:33.780 --> 11:35.912
- I think visiting
hours are over.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.662
- Who were you talking to?

11:48.577 --> 11:49.709
- What?

11:51.406 --> 11:52.363
- I've got it.

11:52.407 --> 11:53.756
Let's go.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.018
Hey B.

11:55.062 --> 11:55.758
- Hey.

11:57.194 --> 11:58.195
- You ready?

12:44.720 --> 12:47.157
- You need a pharmacologist.

12:47.201 --> 12:47.941
- Why you?

12:49.290 --> 12:51.292
- Because you can trust me.

12:51.335 --> 12:52.336
- Can we?

12:53.947 --> 12:54.774
- Pat stays.

13:00.127 --> 13:02.869
- All right then,
everybody ready?

13:19.494 --> 13:20.277
Hop in.

13:43.431 --> 13:44.475
Watch your step.

13:48.392 --> 13:50.612
- How'd you find this place?

13:50.655 --> 13:53.833
- One night we were
students, blind drunk,

13:53.876 --> 13:56.618
me and your dad stumbled onthe elevator, keys inside.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.099
Years later, we remembered,

13:59.142 --> 14:01.449
and so we came down
here to treat your mom.

14:03.146 --> 14:04.626
No one knows about it.

14:04.669 --> 14:06.410
Everyone's forgotten
it even exists.

14:08.369 --> 14:10.937
So, this is your new workspace.

14:10.980 --> 14:12.329
-  Who are they?

14:12.373 --> 14:15.898
-  That's Chris, hehas near-fatal sleep apnea.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.639
And Angela, violent
night-terrors.

14:19.032 --> 14:21.425
They came to me in thehospital, and asked for help.

14:22.426 --> 14:23.514
I'm doing what I can.

14:24.472 --> 14:26.996
We have everything
down here, a full lab,

14:27.040 --> 14:28.955
medications I've
stashed over the years,

14:28.998 --> 14:31.131
and ironically,

14:31.174 --> 14:32.306
sleeping quarters.

14:33.568 --> 14:37.311
Karla, now's our chance
to make things right.

14:47.016 --> 14:48.409
- Why the lock?

14:48.452 --> 14:50.367
- Sleep disorders
can be unpredictable.

14:50.411 --> 14:51.586
It's just a precaution.

14:52.717 --> 14:53.501
Hi guys.

14:58.985 --> 15:01.944
I'll be coming and going
to keep up appearances.

15:01.988 --> 15:03.032
Now get to work.

15:03.076 --> 15:04.947
We'll see you soon.

15:04.991 --> 15:05.861
Good luck, Blake.

15:15.958 --> 15:17.351
- Are you okay with this, B?

15:17.394 --> 15:18.178
- I'm good.

15:20.093 --> 15:21.050
A splash of paint.

15:22.530 --> 15:23.792
Wide-screen TV.

15:24.793 --> 15:26.664
Could be real nice.

15:26.708 --> 15:28.797
- Well, I'm never
too far away, okay?

15:30.581 --> 15:31.365
- Okay.

15:32.409 --> 15:33.193
- Here.

15:39.808 --> 15:41.288
- You ever played this game?

15:43.159 --> 15:45.945
- So, what's with
you and Patrick?

15:46.989 --> 15:47.990
- What do you mean?

15:48.034 --> 15:48.860
- Oh come on.

15:51.559 --> 15:52.429
- We used to date,

15:53.256 --> 15:54.475
a while ago.

15:54.518 --> 15:55.389
It doesn't matter now.

15:55.432 --> 15:56.346
- Wait a minute,

15:56.390 --> 15:58.522
you and jockstrap used to date,

15:58.566 --> 15:59.697
and I'm only finding
out about this now?

15:59.741 --> 16:01.003
- I think we have
more important things

16:01.047 --> 16:02.135
to be thinking about.

16:05.399 --> 16:06.574
- Fine.

16:06.617 --> 16:07.401
Fine.

16:13.407 --> 16:15.539
- Okay, so remember
how we had segments,

16:15.583 --> 16:17.454
so this is where this comes in.

16:17.498 --> 16:20.544
This is the longest road, soit's worth two victory points,

16:20.588 --> 16:22.546
and this card goes to theplayer with the longest road

16:22.590 --> 16:24.984
of at least five segments, okay.

16:25.027 --> 16:26.507
So another player who
builds a longer road,

16:26.550 --> 16:29.031
they can take this card
off you, all right?

16:29.075 --> 16:30.206
Still following?

16:44.438 --> 16:47.658
- So, we know that barbituratesare having zero effect,

16:47.702 --> 16:50.835
but have you heard about
this doxycycline trial?

16:54.926 --> 16:57.799
Yeah, I'll tell you
about it tomorrow.

16:57.842 --> 16:59.409
I'm gonna call it anight, and you should too.

16:59.453 --> 17:00.541
You need sleep.

17:01.890 --> 17:04.110
- Yeah, no, I will.

17:04.153 --> 17:06.199
I'm just gonna work
a little bit longer.

17:11.204 --> 17:12.031
- Fine.

17:15.904 --> 17:17.732
- If you want to sleep,
you should sleep.

17:17.775 --> 17:20.648
- No, I'll just stay
up all night then.

18:44.601 --> 18:45.385
- Hey.

18:46.690 --> 18:47.561
- What?

18:47.604 --> 18:48.518
- Hey, just help me a sec.

18:52.348 --> 18:53.219
- What's going on?

18:55.743 --> 18:58.572
- I think there might be
something behind this.

18:58.615 --> 19:00.139
- What, like a secret door?

19:01.227 --> 19:02.271
- Yeah, maybe.

19:03.664 --> 19:04.969
- Actually?

19:05.013 --> 19:06.188
- Can you just help me?

20:08.381 --> 20:09.686
- It's someone's journal.

20:11.122 --> 20:11.949
Priest,

20:13.299 --> 20:16.302
Father Francis
Sangermano, Sangermano.

20:20.828 --> 20:21.872
Creepy.

20:29.793 --> 20:30.968
- What the hell?

20:32.666 --> 20:33.710
Look.

20:38.019 --> 20:38.759
- What?

20:55.341 --> 20:56.080
- Dad.

20:58.518 --> 21:00.215
- I don't believe it.

21:05.960 --> 21:07.918
- This is Doctor William Dawson.

21:07.962 --> 21:09.703
After exhausting other options,

21:09.746 --> 21:11.661
we've come here to try
out experimental drugs

21:11.705 --> 21:15.143
on patients with potentiallyfatal sleep disorders,

21:15.186 --> 21:17.624
including my wife, Sarah.

21:18.799 --> 21:20.931
I know I'm this close
to the solution.

21:22.411 --> 21:23.238
I know it.

21:27.503 --> 21:28.287
Is it off?

21:30.941 --> 21:31.725
Filming?

21:33.770 --> 21:34.815
-  Yeah, ready.

21:34.858 --> 21:35.859
- Okay good.

21:36.817 --> 21:38.384
So day five,

21:38.427 --> 21:40.342
hopefully one of the drugswill help them return

21:40.386 --> 21:42.431
to normal sleep and normal life.

21:42.475 --> 21:43.302
- Any change?

21:44.303 --> 21:46.827
Oh, sorry, still not used to it.

21:46.870 --> 21:47.871
So, anything?

21:47.915 --> 21:49.090
- No, nothing.

21:49.133 --> 21:50.265
- Perhaps we should
take this opportunity--

21:50.309 --> 21:51.832
-  This is
the devil's work.

21:53.834 --> 21:55.314
- Francis, you're here.

21:56.880 --> 21:59.970
Francis, this is my goodfriend, Doctor Rob Atwood.

22:00.014 --> 22:01.798
- Right, Sarah talks
about you all the time.

22:01.842 --> 22:02.973
-  How is she?

22:03.017 --> 22:04.758
- She's okay, no sleep yet,

22:04.801 --> 22:06.673
but she seems to be improving.

22:10.067 --> 22:11.939
- You look tired, William.

22:11.982 --> 22:13.462
You should get some rest.

22:13.506 --> 22:16.378
-  And Father Sangermano,what does a man of faith

22:16.422 --> 22:17.771
think about what Doctor Dawson

22:17.814 --> 22:19.773
is trying to achieve
here with science?

22:21.601 --> 22:23.690
- What is this, "60 Minutes"?

22:24.865 --> 22:26.345
-  It could
if we cure them.

22:27.476 --> 22:29.217
- It's a misconception
that the church

22:29.260 --> 22:31.393
is against medical science.

22:31.437 --> 22:33.134
Anything to help soothe
the troubled soul,

22:33.177 --> 22:35.832
provided it's not hurtinganyone, is a good thing.

22:37.617 --> 22:38.879
I'm just gonna say hi to Sarah.

22:38.922 --> 22:39.967
- Okay.

22:43.840 --> 22:44.885
- So, a priest?

22:46.626 --> 22:49.498
- Yeah I know,
he's an old friend.

22:49.542 --> 22:51.326
He's the one that married us.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.154
Besides, Sarah wants him here.

22:53.197 --> 22:53.937
- Yeah, but--

22:53.981 --> 22:55.025
- Sorry to interrupt.

22:57.158 --> 22:58.551
William I--

22:58.594 --> 23:00.030
-  Francis, what is it?

23:01.467 --> 23:04.208
- Sarah, she,

23:05.993 --> 23:07.255
she said something.

23:07.298 --> 23:08.082
-  What?

23:19.485 --> 23:21.138
- She wouldn't have,
she can't have.

23:21.182 --> 23:22.966
- It wasn't just that.

23:24.490 --> 23:26.535
It was her voice.

23:26.579 --> 23:28.842
It was as if someone
else was speaking.

23:28.885 --> 23:31.801
- I'm, I don't get it, who?

23:31.845 --> 23:32.889
-  I need to go,

23:34.021 --> 23:35.283
and talk to a friend of mine.

23:35.326 --> 23:36.676
I'll be back soon.

23:36.719 --> 23:37.720
-  Francis?

23:57.261 --> 23:58.219
- Why hide these?

24:00.090 --> 24:01.091
- I don't know.

24:03.137 --> 24:04.268
- We have to tell Rob.

24:07.141 --> 24:10.579
- Maybe, maybe we shouldn't.

24:10.623 --> 24:12.102
- What?

24:12.146 --> 24:13.452
Why wouldn't we tell him?

24:14.627 --> 24:15.715
The information
in here could help

24:15.758 --> 24:17.107
fast-track Blake's treatment.

24:17.151 --> 24:18.979
We could find out
more about my parents.

24:19.022 --> 24:21.155
- Yeah but, why didn't
he mention this to you?

24:23.418 --> 24:24.201
- Well,

24:25.464 --> 24:27.030
how could he know
they were hidden?

24:27.074 --> 24:29.990
- Yeah, but he knew thatthey were made, he's in them.

24:30.033 --> 24:31.687
I mean, don't you think
that's a little strange

24:31.731 --> 24:32.949
that he didn't tell
you that there was

24:32.993 --> 24:34.690
a record of your
parents' final days?

24:36.736 --> 24:38.128
Look, let's just
watch them first,

24:38.172 --> 24:41.218
and get a bit moreinformation, then we tell him.

24:41.262 --> 24:42.524
Where's the harm in that?

24:47.747 --> 24:48.530
- Okay.

24:49.966 --> 24:51.359
Let's watch the next one then.

25:13.250 --> 25:15.252
- What are you doing?

25:15.296 --> 25:16.079
- Working.

25:17.124 --> 25:18.038
What are you doing?

25:38.841 --> 25:39.973
- Karla, you're tired.

25:40.800 --> 25:41.975
Let me take your shift.

25:46.719 --> 25:47.502
- No thanks.

26:01.821 --> 26:02.648
Hey.

26:24.104 --> 26:29.109
Blake.

26:31.241 --> 26:36.246
Blake?

26:37.204 --> 26:38.118
Blake?

26:38.161 --> 26:39.206
Blake?

26:55.483 --> 26:56.266
- Hey KJ.

27:00.183 --> 27:01.228
- Hey.

27:06.537 --> 27:07.321
You were,

27:13.153 --> 27:14.720
what were you doing?

27:16.852 --> 27:18.201
- I don't know.

27:22.466 --> 27:26.209
- Well you couldn't move
at all yesterday so,

27:27.646 --> 27:28.995
you must be feeling better.

27:29.909 --> 27:30.692
- Yeah.

27:31.998 --> 27:33.260
Feeling much better now.

27:34.740 --> 27:35.566
Thank you.

28:02.071 --> 28:02.898
- Hey.

28:05.553 --> 28:08.077
So, how did Blake respondto the new combination?

28:09.209 --> 28:11.341
- Yeah, he seems
to be doing better.

28:11.385 --> 28:13.169
He's got a lot more mobility.

28:15.084 --> 28:16.651
Still no REM sleep though.

28:25.355 --> 28:27.618
Is there something that
you needed, Patrick?

28:31.666 --> 28:35.017
- Yeah actually,
I wanted to talk.

28:39.108 --> 28:40.501
- Well, there's nothing to say.

28:40.544 --> 28:42.068
- Come on, we could at
least clear the air.

28:42.111 --> 28:43.809
- It's not logical tokeep doing the same thing

28:43.852 --> 28:45.201
and expecting a
different result.

28:45.245 --> 28:47.160
- Relationships aren't
about logic, Karla,

28:47.203 --> 28:48.770
they're about the way we feel.

28:48.814 --> 28:51.077
- Fine, I feel like as soonas things got hard with Blake,

28:51.120 --> 28:52.034
you just walked out on me.

28:52.078 --> 28:53.427
- I never walked out on Blake.

28:53.470 --> 28:56.169
- No, you walked out onme, Patrick, you just left.

28:59.302 --> 29:00.347
What?

29:02.305 --> 29:03.089
- I'm sorry.

29:07.484 --> 29:10.618
- Yeah well, what good
does that do me now?

30:46.279 --> 30:47.846
How are you doing?

30:54.417 --> 30:55.854
Who keeps moving this?

31:00.423 --> 31:02.208
-  It's evil.

31:12.566 --> 31:14.524
- Angela, did you say something?

31:30.323 --> 31:33.108
-  Okay, so Williamyou have to end this.

31:33.152 --> 31:34.022
- What?

31:34.066 --> 31:35.371
-  It's gone too far.

31:35.415 --> 31:36.546
- William, what is he
actually doing here?

31:36.590 --> 31:38.722
- Sarah asked for me to be here.

31:38.766 --> 31:39.898
Open your eyes.

31:41.073 --> 31:42.378
You don't have to
be religious to know

31:42.422 --> 31:43.902
that what's going on in
that room isn't natural.

31:43.945 --> 31:47.035
- Nothing here is natural,that's what we're trying to fix.

31:47.079 --> 31:48.341
We're trying to get
her and the others

31:48.384 --> 31:49.342
back to a normal life.

31:49.385 --> 31:50.821
I'm trying to save them.

31:50.865 --> 31:52.388
- Something is wrong with Sarah,

31:52.432 --> 31:54.521
something more
than that disease.

31:55.609 --> 31:56.697
She won't talk to me.

31:57.959 --> 31:59.918
When she looks at
me, it terrifies me.

31:59.961 --> 32:01.528
- Well maybe that's becauseevery time you come here,

32:01.571 --> 32:04.574
you terrify her, and therest of with your crazy talk.

32:06.402 --> 32:08.361
- I spent some time
with this, William.

32:10.015 --> 32:11.407
I've spoken to my Cardinal.

32:12.800 --> 32:13.583
I believe

32:14.933 --> 32:15.934
that Sarah may be

32:18.023 --> 32:19.024
possessed.

32:19.894 --> 32:21.330
-  Jesus Christ.

32:21.374 --> 32:24.812
- Francis, listen toyourself, that's ridiculous.

32:24.855 --> 32:26.031
-  What the hell?

32:27.467 --> 32:28.250
It's here.

32:30.905 --> 32:32.428
William you have
to listen to me.

32:53.623 --> 32:54.668
- You did just--

32:54.711 --> 32:56.365
- Yeah.

32:56.409 --> 32:57.149
I sure did.

33:03.198 --> 33:04.504
- Okay, day eight.

33:04.547 --> 33:07.986
We've been progressing--

33:08.029 --> 33:10.901
- He's here, he's
inside the room!

33:16.124 --> 33:16.951
- Okay,

33:18.083 --> 33:19.867
they're now displaying
extreme paranoia,

33:19.910 --> 33:24.263
except for Sarah, who
is quite different.

33:25.699 --> 33:28.093
We're gonna need to try
some stronger sedation.

33:30.312 --> 33:31.226
It'll be okay.

33:32.532 --> 33:33.750
We'll go in there together.

33:59.167 --> 34:00.386
- Shit, his shots.

34:01.822 --> 34:02.649
- No, look.

34:12.224 --> 34:13.747
-  My God!

34:19.535 --> 34:20.319
- Blake.

34:22.147 --> 34:23.670
Don't watch any more without me.

34:31.460 --> 34:32.461
- Hey KJ.

34:46.562 --> 34:47.694
- How are you feeling?

34:49.652 --> 34:51.741
- Better, good.

34:56.224 --> 35:01.229
- You feel like maybe, youwant to get some sleep?

35:01.577 --> 35:02.578
- Maybe.

35:04.841 --> 35:06.104
Still counting sheep.

35:30.824 --> 35:32.130
- Are you okay?

35:33.870 --> 35:35.350
- He's trying to get me.

35:38.832 --> 35:39.615
- Who is?

35:40.834 --> 35:43.663
- Blake, he keeps on
whispering to someone,

35:43.706 --> 35:45.534
but nobody's there.

35:45.578 --> 35:48.320
You have to get me out of here.

35:49.538 --> 35:50.539
- It's okay.

35:50.583 --> 35:52.802
- I can't stay here.

35:53.673 --> 35:55.065
- We're gonna make you better.

35:56.241 --> 35:58.243
We're gonna make you all better.

36:15.825 --> 36:16.609
- Shhh.

36:27.489 --> 36:28.534
- Did you see that?

36:28.577 --> 36:30.057
- What?

36:30.100 --> 36:32.407
- Angela, she grabbed me.

36:32.451 --> 36:34.148
She was saying
stuff about Blake.

36:34.192 --> 36:35.280
- Huh?

36:35.323 --> 36:37.282
- Angela, she
grabbed me, just now.

36:37.325 --> 36:38.631
- Karla, I was watching
you the whole time,

36:38.674 --> 36:40.023
I didn't see any of that.

36:41.764 --> 36:42.896
Look, if you're
worried about Angela,

36:42.939 --> 36:45.333
she'll be fine once
the sedatives set in.

36:45.377 --> 36:47.901
Until Rob gets back, I'mkeeping a close eye on her.

36:49.903 --> 36:51.339
You need to get some rest.

36:53.254 --> 36:54.690
- No,

36:54.734 --> 36:56.257
no I'm gonna,

36:56.301 --> 36:57.171
I'm gonna stay up,

36:58.694 --> 36:59.956
and keep watch.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.828
You know, make sure
they're all okay.

37:03.960 --> 37:04.744
Hey Pat?

37:12.708 --> 37:13.492
No, nothing.

37:15.581 --> 37:16.364
Never mind.

38:11.767 --> 38:13.291
- Please, please.

38:23.823 --> 38:25.390
Just leave me alone.

38:40.318 --> 38:41.362
- Let me out!

38:41.406 --> 38:42.276
Let me out!

39:15.004 --> 39:16.963
- Angela don't.

39:17.006 --> 39:18.965
- A present for you, KJ.

39:19.008 --> 39:20.053
-  No!

39:36.025 --> 39:36.896
- You okay?

39:59.309 --> 40:00.615
- Blake's looking at me,

40:01.921 --> 40:03.270
almost like he was pleased.

40:05.533 --> 40:07.840
I think he told her to do it.

40:07.883 --> 40:10.712
- Hon, she was really sick.

40:10.756 --> 40:12.279
I don't think--
- I know what I saw.

40:14.020 --> 40:15.238
- I believe you, Karla.

40:18.503 --> 40:20.940
- Well whatever happened,this can't continue.

40:20.983 --> 40:22.245
- But Blake--

40:22.289 --> 40:23.508
- I had to contact
Angela's family.

40:23.551 --> 40:24.813
We can't lie them
about what happened,

40:24.857 --> 40:26.032
where it happened.

40:27.294 --> 40:29.035
This is on me.

40:29.078 --> 40:32.168
You guys weren't here, I'lltake full responsibility.

40:32.212 --> 40:33.082
- But what about Blake?

40:33.126 --> 40:34.823
- We have to take Angela home.

40:37.522 --> 40:41.526
After that we'll findsomeplace else to treat Blake.

40:42.657 --> 40:43.441
I'm sorry.

40:47.836 --> 40:49.882
- Wait a second,
where is Patrick?

40:49.925 --> 40:51.361
I went and told
him what happened.

40:51.405 --> 40:52.928
- I knew he'd take off atthe first sign of trouble.

40:54.234 --> 40:55.801
He's unbelievable.

40:55.844 --> 40:58.020
- I'll stay with
Blake and Chris,

40:58.064 --> 40:59.326
you take Angela upstairs.

41:02.242 --> 41:03.983
Go, I'll watch them.

41:25.483 --> 41:27.310
- It's stuck, it won't turn.

41:27.354 --> 41:28.094
- What?

41:28.137 --> 41:28.921
- It won't budge.

41:32.272 --> 41:35.144
No, the button doesn'twork unless it's unlocked.

41:35.188 --> 41:36.972
- Here, let me try it.

41:50.464 --> 41:52.335
- See, it's not gonna work.

41:53.380 --> 41:56.078
- Okay, stairs.

42:05.784 --> 42:08.308
-  Is there
another stairwell?

42:08.351 --> 42:09.135
- No.

42:11.093 --> 42:12.138
- Of course.

42:12.921 --> 42:13.705
Awesome.

42:14.880 --> 42:15.837
- What are we gonna do?

42:15.881 --> 42:16.925
How are we gonna
get out of here?

42:16.969 --> 42:18.274
- There's a phone.

42:18.318 --> 42:20.363
I'll contact the hospitalabout getting us out.

42:23.192 --> 42:23.976
Yes, I know.

42:25.630 --> 42:26.413
I know.

42:28.981 --> 42:29.764
Thank you.

42:31.636 --> 42:33.159
- Well?

42:33.202 --> 42:35.074
- Maintenance said they'll bedown here some time tomorrow,

42:35.117 --> 42:36.336
could be the morning.

42:36.379 --> 42:37.859
- Don't they know
we're stuck down here?

42:40.427 --> 42:42.255
- We have until morning?

42:43.125 --> 42:44.257
-  Yeah.

42:46.041 --> 42:47.521
- We shouldn't waste that time.

42:49.001 --> 42:50.611
-  Karla's right,we should do what we can.

42:50.655 --> 42:52.526
Stay focused on what you
came down here to do,

42:52.570 --> 42:54.093
and we'll be out of
here before you know it.

42:54.136 --> 42:56.791
Patrick, could you
help me with the body?

43:32.087 --> 43:32.871
- Hey?

43:34.786 --> 43:35.569
- Hey.

43:38.180 --> 43:39.225
How are you feeling?

43:41.619 --> 43:42.402
- Me?

43:43.621 --> 43:44.447
I'm fine.

43:46.667 --> 43:47.450
Angie, she--

43:52.542 --> 43:53.326
What happened?

43:54.893 --> 43:57.025
I can only remember--

43:57.069 --> 43:58.070
- She,

44:02.074 --> 44:04.250
I guess her condition
got the better of her.

44:19.308 --> 44:22.529
- I guess she's in
a better place now.

44:44.682 --> 44:48.250
- Do you remember whenRob got us those rabbits?

44:54.213 --> 44:55.344
- Millie and

44:56.519 --> 44:57.303
Anna Claire.

45:00.567 --> 45:01.350
Millie died.

45:03.570 --> 45:04.266
- Yeah.

45:09.097 --> 45:10.229
And I was so worried about

45:11.578 --> 45:15.582
what happened, you know?

45:15.625 --> 45:16.452
Where she went.

45:20.195 --> 45:21.066
And you just said,

45:22.371 --> 45:24.112
"It's okay KJ,

45:26.245 --> 45:27.246
she's in heaven."

45:31.598 --> 45:32.817
You just believed it.

45:36.037 --> 45:38.910
Like you knew it was true.

45:42.870 --> 45:45.786
I mean you could just
do that, just believe.

45:53.098 --> 45:54.229
I didn't trust God.

45:58.190 --> 46:00.540
I didn't feel safe
with the idea.

46:04.239 --> 46:06.459
And then I couldn't
understand Him.

46:08.853 --> 46:10.332
You got sick and,

46:12.595 --> 46:14.554
I started to hate Him,

46:16.817 --> 46:19.951
like really hate Him.

46:26.218 --> 46:29.351
And I want to believe
like you, I do.

46:32.746 --> 46:33.747
But I can't.

46:37.403 --> 46:39.100
Now I deal like this.

46:43.539 --> 46:44.323
- KJ?

46:49.589 --> 46:54.115
I'm gonna kill you, justlike I did your cunt mother.

47:41.423 --> 47:42.207
- Hey.

47:57.700 --> 47:59.180
I spoke to Alice.

48:01.139 --> 48:02.357
She told me that you,

48:06.361 --> 48:07.406
are you okay?

48:10.409 --> 48:11.540
- I meant what I said.

48:13.586 --> 48:14.326
Blake.

48:14.369 --> 48:15.414
- He can't have.

48:16.415 --> 48:17.198
You imagined it.

48:18.156 --> 48:18.939
You're exhausted.

48:18.983 --> 48:19.984
- I didn't imagine it.

48:23.596 --> 48:25.119
Can you just believe me?

48:34.868 --> 48:36.348
There's something going on here.

48:38.698 --> 48:39.481
Something bad.

48:43.137 --> 48:44.138
- Like what?

48:46.401 --> 48:49.274
- I want to show
you something but,

48:50.449 --> 48:52.190
I'm worried you're
gonna run away again.

48:55.933 --> 48:57.543
- Karla, it was a mistake.

48:59.197 --> 49:00.546
- You just abandoned me, Pat.

49:03.375 --> 49:05.638
- You were so focused
on curing Blake,

49:13.341 --> 49:15.865
I couldn't see that thatwas more important than me,

49:18.390 --> 49:19.391
than us.

49:22.785 --> 49:24.091
I never should have left.

49:29.836 --> 49:30.619
Hey,

49:32.534 --> 49:34.449
there is nowhere
else I want to be.

49:38.801 --> 49:39.802
I'm so sorry.

49:51.597 --> 49:54.165
-  This isMartin, he has cataplexy,

49:54.208 --> 49:56.471
which commenced
at around age six.

49:56.515 --> 49:57.690
-  Five.

49:57.733 --> 49:59.431
-  I'm sorry, five.

49:59.474 --> 50:00.649
How are you feeling?

50:03.478 --> 50:05.045
What's that, can you
speak up for the camera?

50:05.089 --> 50:07.265
- Stop yelling at me.

50:07.308 --> 50:08.831
Stop yelling at me.

50:11.182 --> 50:12.400
It's your voice.

50:14.185 --> 50:15.577
His voice.

50:15.621 --> 50:17.362
-  Whose voice
is inside your head?

50:21.235 --> 50:22.584
This is Ursula.

50:23.542 --> 50:25.587
Kleine Levin syndrome.

50:25.631 --> 50:27.415
Potentially
life-threatening she--

50:31.071 --> 50:32.594
What is it Ursula?

50:49.655 --> 50:53.702
Sarah, Fatal Familial Insomnia.

50:54.660 --> 50:56.879
I'm here baby, talk to me.

50:56.923 --> 50:57.880
How are you feeling?

51:02.015 --> 51:03.277
- Here sometimes.

51:05.236 --> 51:06.193
Gone sometimes.

51:07.412 --> 51:09.022
-  Gone,
where do you go?

51:10.719 --> 51:11.503
- With him.

51:13.157 --> 51:13.983
-  Who?

51:17.726 --> 51:19.250
- Between awake and asleep.

51:21.643 --> 51:22.862
That's where he is.

51:23.689 --> 51:24.516
Trying to get in.

51:26.257 --> 51:27.388
-  Who is he?

51:31.697 --> 51:32.741
- Iddimu.

51:35.396 --> 51:36.484
-  Who's Iddimu?

51:38.051 --> 51:39.487
You've improved so much,

51:39.531 --> 51:41.620
it'll only be a
little longer, Sarah.

51:48.627 --> 51:50.281
- Why do you keep
calling me Sarah?

52:04.730 --> 52:07.080
-  When's thelast time you slept, doctor?

52:08.560 --> 52:09.561
- Jesus!

52:11.954 --> 52:14.000
- She shouldn't be
able to see us, right?

52:15.001 --> 52:16.481
- I'm getting Francis.

52:16.524 --> 52:18.309
- No, William.

52:18.352 --> 52:19.658
William?

52:19.701 --> 52:21.007
-  You gotta see this.

52:21.050 --> 52:23.792
- No no William, I'm surethis can be explained.

52:25.446 --> 52:26.230
- Oh my God.

52:27.361 --> 52:29.058
-  Let me out!

52:30.799 --> 52:31.844
- It was here a minute ago,

52:31.887 --> 52:34.151
Sarah, she was staring
straight at us.

52:37.545 --> 52:38.938
- Those are Bible pages.

52:41.158 --> 52:42.376
Mother of God.

52:44.422 --> 52:46.728
You have to end this, now!

52:46.772 --> 52:47.816
William.

52:49.470 --> 52:52.343
- Sarah, say something, letme know you're all right.

52:52.386 --> 52:54.040
We have to go in there.

52:54.083 --> 52:55.259
-  She just has to sleep.

52:55.302 --> 52:58.349
-  She no
longer needs to sleep.

53:45.787 --> 53:46.788
-  Hey.

53:49.226 --> 53:50.879
- What is it, Alice?

53:50.923 --> 53:52.403
- You both have to see this.

53:55.884 --> 53:57.712
- This had better be good.

53:57.756 --> 53:59.366
- Okay okay look, Iddimu.

54:00.802 --> 54:03.544
The one who takes us fromthe nocturnal refuge,

54:03.588 --> 54:06.199
the parasite that will
destroy all things.

54:06.243 --> 54:07.635
It says here, that
when a demon ruled,

54:07.679 --> 54:08.810
there was a land without sleep.

54:08.854 --> 54:11.073
But God overpowered
him and created sleep

54:11.117 --> 54:13.250
to protect us from
his influence.

54:13.293 --> 54:16.514
So if you stay awake toolong, the demon will get in.

54:16.557 --> 54:18.559
It must have been what
happened to your mom.

54:20.213 --> 54:21.345
- What?

54:21.388 --> 54:22.607
- Don't try and tell me that

54:22.650 --> 54:24.478
what was on those tapes
was purely medical.

54:24.522 --> 54:25.740
Sangermano researched this,

54:25.784 --> 54:27.699
and he put everything
right here.

54:29.222 --> 54:30.615
I think you're right, Karla,

54:30.658 --> 54:32.181
there is something
happening here.

54:32.225 --> 54:34.706
- Yeah, there are sickpeople who need our help.

54:34.749 --> 54:35.750
- It's not Blake's sickness

54:35.794 --> 54:38.057
that's causing him
to be like this.

54:38.100 --> 54:38.840
Listen,

54:41.713 --> 54:42.931
once the demon has awoken,

54:42.975 --> 54:45.499
he will feed on the
souls of innocents.

54:45.543 --> 54:46.805
When they hear his
seductive whisper,

54:46.848 --> 54:48.197
they will give their
souls to the void

54:48.241 --> 54:49.547
and increase his power.

54:50.809 --> 54:53.246
Once the demon has
consumed what he needs,

54:53.290 --> 54:54.378
he can be set free.

54:56.858 --> 54:57.729
- What does that mean?

55:00.209 --> 55:01.907
- No need for a
human host anymore.

55:07.042 --> 55:10.829
- So, how do we helpBlake, how do we stop this?

55:14.528 --> 55:15.442
- An exorcism.

55:18.402 --> 55:19.359
- I've heard enough.

55:22.971 --> 55:24.059
You don't believe this, do you?

55:24.103 --> 55:25.757
- The medications
aren't working.

55:25.800 --> 55:27.062
An exorcism is the only way.

55:27.106 --> 55:29.935
The incantations are right here.

55:29.978 --> 55:30.849
- Come on.

55:30.892 --> 55:31.850
- Just because you can't see it,

55:31.893 --> 55:33.373
doesn't mean it's not happening.

55:33.417 --> 55:34.766
It's our only choice.

55:35.941 --> 55:40.685
- So, you want to give
Blake an exorcism?

55:42.643 --> 55:43.949
- You have to have faith.

55:43.992 --> 55:45.254
- Blake doesn't
have time for this.

55:45.298 --> 55:47.953
We need to keep treating
him with real medicine.

55:47.996 --> 55:49.824
This is occult bullshit.

55:49.868 --> 55:51.478
She's letting her
witchcraft fantasies

55:51.522 --> 55:52.392
threaten Blake's life.

55:52.436 --> 55:53.959
- Hey, I'm right here, you know.

55:54.002 --> 55:55.569
- You're letting your stupidlittle witchcraft shit

55:55.613 --> 55:56.875
threaten Blake's life.

55:56.918 --> 55:58.964
- I love Blake just
as much as you do.

55:59.007 --> 56:01.967
I would never endanger hislife on a whim, you asshole.

56:07.799 --> 56:08.539
- Alice?

56:11.846 --> 56:14.153
- Look, I know that
this sounds crazy,

56:14.196 --> 56:16.503
but I've seen things
that I can't explain.

56:18.157 --> 56:20.855
- How can you think somethinglike this is even possible?

56:22.291 --> 56:23.423
- Because I know Blake,

56:25.207 --> 56:26.165
and I knew my mom.

57:08.512 --> 57:12.472
- You know, those tapes
don't make any sense.

57:12.516 --> 57:14.866
- Yeah, I know.

57:14.909 --> 57:16.215
- You know, I mean thingswere getting hectic,

57:16.258 --> 57:18.130
they were about to
go inside that room.

57:20.959 --> 57:21.742
- Yeah?

57:22.961 --> 57:24.266
- Why would you not film that?

57:26.268 --> 57:30.055
- Well, we've watched
everything in the box.

57:30.098 --> 57:31.230
There are no more tapes.

57:32.274 --> 57:33.928
Maybe one got lost or damaged.

57:33.972 --> 57:35.408
- Maybe?

57:35.452 --> 57:37.715
Unless things got crazy
and whoever hid them

57:37.758 --> 57:38.803
didn't have time to.

57:40.239 --> 57:41.022
- What?

57:42.502 --> 57:43.285
- The camera.

57:44.939 --> 57:47.028
We didn't check to
see if there's a tape
still left inside.

59:11.069 --> 59:11.983
- Bygone era.

59:26.084 --> 59:26.998
- Whoever finds this,

59:28.216 --> 59:31.176
please, please give
this to my kids.

59:32.307 --> 59:33.657
They deserve to
know what happened

59:33.700 --> 59:35.746
and what I've done.

59:37.225 --> 59:38.009
Karla,

59:39.184 --> 59:41.229
Blake, I swear,

59:42.056 --> 59:43.841
I brought her here to save her.

59:49.281 --> 59:50.064
I'm sorry.

59:54.460 --> 59:55.243
Goodbye.

1:00:04.122 --> 1:00:05.689
Turn that thing off, now.

1:00:07.168 --> 1:00:08.605
- Faith is our only weapon.

1:00:10.084 --> 1:00:11.608
Make sure you follow
my lead, understood?

1:00:11.651 --> 1:00:12.521
- This is madness.

1:00:12.565 --> 1:00:13.435
-  I won't ask again.

1:00:13.479 --> 1:00:14.915
-  Of course, Father.

1:00:14.959 --> 1:00:16.395
- William?

1:00:16.438 --> 1:00:17.222
William?

1:00:26.927 --> 1:00:28.015
-  Sarah.

1:00:28.059 --> 1:00:30.801
- You're not welcome
here, priest.

1:00:30.844 --> 1:00:33.760
I'll take this whore with meif you come one step closer.

1:00:33.804 --> 1:00:35.849
-  Sarah, please.

1:00:54.389 --> 1:00:55.173
- William's dead.

1:00:56.609 --> 1:00:57.349
We're all dead.

1:00:59.438 --> 1:01:01.658
- I know, we've got
to get out of here.

1:01:02.571 --> 1:01:04.138
-  Weaver can use this.

1:01:04.182 --> 1:01:06.271
We've got to keep
this as a record, too.

1:01:06.314 --> 1:01:07.576
- Give it to me.

1:01:07.620 --> 1:01:08.795
Give it to me.

1:01:10.101 --> 1:01:11.537
You're a priest.

1:01:11.580 --> 1:01:13.670
You've ruined everything.

1:01:29.207 --> 1:01:31.557
- I don't know who
might find these tapes,

1:01:31.600 --> 1:01:34.255
but Robert, Doctor RobertAtwood is responsible

1:01:34.299 --> 1:01:35.256
for the deaths.

1:02:09.073 --> 1:02:10.291
- We have to warn Alice.

1:02:51.811 --> 1:02:52.594
- Alice?

1:02:53.639 --> 1:02:55.032
-  Alice?

1:03:30.894 --> 1:03:32.373
- No.

1:03:32.417 --> 1:03:33.331
- Do you believe now, KJ?

1:03:33.374 --> 1:03:34.506
- No!

1:04:12.457 --> 1:04:13.588
- Oh come on.

1:04:15.155 --> 1:04:16.853
There's no dial tone.

1:04:29.300 --> 1:04:30.083
Fuck!

1:04:33.217 --> 1:04:35.306
- Patrick, calm down.

1:04:35.349 --> 1:04:36.960
Stop okay, please?

1:04:37.961 --> 1:04:39.876
- We have to go, right now.

1:04:39.919 --> 1:04:41.486
- I'm not leaving without Blake.

1:04:41.529 --> 1:04:43.183
- No Karla, we have to go.

1:04:43.227 --> 1:04:44.445
Don't you get it, we've
gotta get out of here.

1:04:44.489 --> 1:04:46.404
- Patrick, calm down
okay, and listen to me.

1:04:46.447 --> 1:04:48.275
Sangermano wrote the
whole thing down.

1:04:48.319 --> 1:04:49.929
I know what to do.

1:04:49.973 --> 1:04:53.324
- Nothing can stop this,
we have to go right now.

1:04:53.367 --> 1:04:56.196
- I'm not going anywhere
without my brother.

1:04:56.240 --> 1:04:57.241
I'm staying.

1:05:04.161 --> 1:05:05.945
Look at me, look
at me, look at me.

1:05:05.989 --> 1:05:06.728
Patrick.

1:05:08.643 --> 1:05:09.427
I need you.

1:05:10.428 --> 1:05:11.777
Okay?

1:05:11.820 --> 1:05:12.734
It's gonna be okay.

1:05:14.388 --> 1:05:15.172
Yeah?

1:05:17.609 --> 1:05:18.349
- Yeah.

1:05:18.392 --> 1:05:19.437
- Yeah.

1:05:20.786 --> 1:05:21.569
Okay.

1:05:22.875 --> 1:05:26.357
- Okay.

1:05:26.400 --> 1:05:27.445
- Okay.

1:05:38.760 --> 1:05:39.848
-  The door.

1:06:09.835 --> 1:06:10.705
-  Patrick.

1:06:18.148 --> 1:06:18.975
Pat?

1:06:25.198 --> 1:06:26.199
Christopher.

1:06:27.679 --> 1:06:28.854
Hey, Chris.

1:06:28.897 --> 1:06:30.334
Chris, you okay?

1:06:35.426 --> 1:06:37.123
-  His eyes.

1:06:37.167 --> 1:06:38.864
How could he do this?

1:07:27.913 --> 1:07:29.523
- Let's get Blake.

1:07:45.365 --> 1:07:46.149
Hey,

1:07:47.324 --> 1:07:48.107
you okay?

1:07:49.500 --> 1:07:50.805
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1:08:35.328 --> 1:08:38.070
- I don't know
what I saw to read.

1:08:38.114 --> 1:08:39.637
- You'd better figure it out.

1:08:42.727 --> 1:08:46.992
- The Lord is my shepherd,I shall not want.

1:08:47.035 --> 1:08:50.604
He leads me by the stillwaters, he restores my soul.

1:09:00.701 --> 1:09:03.356
Yay, though I walk the valleyof the shadow of death.

1:09:03.400 --> 1:09:04.183
- It's not working.

1:09:04.227 --> 1:09:05.619
- I shall fear no evil.

1:09:10.407 --> 1:09:12.409
Iddimu, you are revealed.

1:09:13.801 --> 1:09:16.282
I beg you through the
intercession and help

1:09:16.326 --> 1:09:18.110
of the Archangels Michael.

1:09:18.154 --> 1:09:18.893
- Robert.

1:09:18.937 --> 1:09:20.199
- Stay out of this.

1:09:20.243 --> 1:09:21.592
Give me that book.

1:09:23.159 --> 1:09:24.116
Give it to me.

1:09:24.160 --> 1:09:25.378
- Keep reading.

1:09:25.422 --> 1:09:27.337
- I beg through the
intercession and help

1:09:27.380 --> 1:09:31.167
of the Archangel Michael,Rafael, and Gabriel.

1:09:35.258 --> 1:09:36.650
Of the evil one.

1:09:42.787 --> 1:09:43.831
Patrick!

1:09:50.142 --> 1:09:51.491
- You're insane.

1:09:52.405 --> 1:09:53.189
- Hey Rob.

1:10:05.723 --> 1:10:07.812
- You're okay, you're okay.

1:10:15.298 --> 1:10:16.255
You're okay.

1:10:24.307 --> 1:10:25.133
Nope.

1:10:29.312 --> 1:10:30.095
Patrick?

1:10:31.052 --> 1:10:32.663
Patrick.

1:10:32.706 --> 1:10:33.794
Patrick.

1:10:33.838 --> 1:10:35.274
Patrick!

1:10:35.318 --> 1:10:36.101
Patrick!

1:11:39.382 --> 1:11:41.819
Why didn't you just kill me?

1:11:43.908 --> 1:11:46.780
- The more a demon consumes,the stronger he becomes.

1:11:48.913 --> 1:11:50.654
I needed as many
of you as possible.

1:12:01.012 --> 1:12:04.320
- So is this what
your life amounts to?

1:12:05.582 --> 1:12:07.497
Is killing people
who trusted you?

1:12:11.152 --> 1:12:12.806
You were like a father to me.

1:12:15.940 --> 1:12:16.854
You're a coward.

1:12:18.072 --> 1:12:20.379
- What do you know of courage?

1:12:20.423 --> 1:12:21.206
Nothing.

1:12:22.903 --> 1:12:23.861
I was trapped,

1:12:25.253 --> 1:12:27.995
tormented every day,
and he saved me.

1:12:29.954 --> 1:12:32.913
He took away the monster
that made my life hell,

1:12:34.567 --> 1:12:37.657
who made me want to end
it every single day.

1:12:39.616 --> 1:12:41.922
There was another boy, Cody.

1:12:43.794 --> 1:12:44.925
Iddimu possessed him,

1:12:46.231 --> 1:12:49.016
and I saw a power I
never knew could exist.

1:12:54.718 --> 1:12:58.809
And in an instant
everything changed.

1:13:01.507 --> 1:13:04.989
But Cody took back control andstopped him from getting in,

1:13:06.251 --> 1:13:07.208
the only way he could.

1:13:07.252 --> 1:13:08.384
-  I can't
let him back in.

1:13:09.907 --> 1:13:10.908
- No!

1:13:13.998 --> 1:13:16.479
-  Iddimu
gave me my freedom,

1:13:16.522 --> 1:13:18.394
and I owe him the same.

1:13:19.960 --> 1:13:22.441
I researched him for years.

1:13:22.485 --> 1:13:24.574
I tried to get
him to wake in me,

1:13:24.617 --> 1:13:25.879
but he never took over.

1:13:27.098 --> 1:13:29.492
I only felt his presence

1:13:29.535 --> 1:13:31.494
lingering at the edge
of consciousness.

1:13:33.713 --> 1:13:35.149
When you stay awake too long,

1:13:36.977 --> 1:13:38.370
hear things you shouldn't,

1:13:39.806 --> 1:13:43.070
and see things thataren't there, that's him,

1:13:44.115 --> 1:13:45.333
trying to get in.

1:13:46.596 --> 1:13:48.728
To help Iddimu I needed a host.

1:13:50.034 --> 1:13:53.341
I reconnected with Williamonce I heard about your mother,

1:13:53.385 --> 1:13:55.343
an FFI sufferer,

1:13:55.387 --> 1:13:56.649
the perfect candidate.

1:13:57.911 --> 1:13:59.565
I suggested the trials,

1:13:59.609 --> 1:14:02.742
reminded William of this
place, and we began.

1:14:04.396 --> 1:14:07.617
But then, the priest arrived.

1:14:09.445 --> 1:14:11.098
Whatever he did to Sarah,

1:14:12.012 --> 1:14:14.058
after she killed your father,

1:14:14.101 --> 1:14:15.363
she killed herself.

1:14:16.539 --> 1:14:19.933
Once again, Iddimu
was denied freedom.

1:14:23.502 --> 1:14:25.373
After I recite this incantation,

1:14:29.116 --> 1:14:30.248
Iddimu will be free again.

1:14:35.558 --> 1:14:36.384
- Robert?

1:14:39.692 --> 1:14:41.302
- You can finally
sleep now, hon.

1:17:57.411 --> 1:18:02.112
My lord, Iddimu, scourge
of the nocturnal refuge,

1:18:02.155 --> 1:18:04.201
ruler of the ever-waking fire,

1:18:05.202 --> 1:18:06.246
come forth.

1:18:31.228 --> 1:18:33.360
- Spirits whose die king, amen.

1:18:35.188 --> 1:18:36.233
In the name of the Lord, amen,

1:18:36.276 --> 1:18:37.713
he be gone from the
body of this man,

1:18:37.756 --> 1:18:39.279
so he may rest--

1:18:46.156 --> 1:18:47.287
Blake it's me.

1:18:51.161 --> 1:18:51.901
It's KJ.

1:19:08.439 --> 1:19:10.310
- Your brother is gone.

1:19:15.272 --> 1:19:17.927
- I beg you Lord, throughthe intercession and help

1:19:17.970 --> 1:19:22.322
of the Archangels Michael,Rafael, and Gabriel,

1:19:22.366 --> 1:19:25.543
to deliver thou brother whois enslaved by the evil one.

1:19:25.586 --> 1:19:26.805
-  My lord
Iddimu, come forth

1:19:26.849 --> 1:19:29.373
and break the bonds
of your human prison.

1:20:02.580 --> 1:20:05.191
-  Nothing controls me.

1:20:06.062 --> 1:20:06.845
- No.

1:20:09.108 --> 1:20:09.892
No.

1:20:11.154 --> 1:20:11.937
My lord,

1:20:13.504 --> 1:20:15.201
I can set you free.

1:21:10.517 --> 1:21:11.475
- Blake, stop.

1:21:13.477 --> 1:21:14.913
Don't let him win, okay?

1:21:18.395 --> 1:21:20.092
I need you to help me beat him.

1:21:25.315 --> 1:21:26.490
I need you to try.

1:21:27.708 --> 1:21:28.840
I need you to fight.

1:21:30.537 --> 1:21:31.321
Blake!

1:21:45.988 --> 1:21:46.814
Blake?

1:21:48.033 --> 1:21:48.860
Hey, hey.

1:22:00.959 --> 1:22:01.699
- KJ.

1:22:08.227 --> 1:22:09.794
I'm so sorry.

1:22:09.837 --> 1:22:10.838
- It's okay.

1:22:12.623 --> 1:22:13.841
It's over now.

1:22:18.629 --> 1:22:19.847
It's over now.
