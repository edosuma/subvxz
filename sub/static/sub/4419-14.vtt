09:03.777 --> 09:05.310
LET'S PAY THEM
A VISIT.

09:09.783 --> 09:11.216
THIS HOUSE
IS HUGE!

09:11.285 --> 09:12.617
IT'S BIGGER THAN
CARTMAN'S ASS.

09:12.686 --> 09:14.319
NO IT ISN'T,
YOU GUYS.

09:14.388 --> 09:15.787
CAN I HELP YOU?

09:15.856 --> 09:17.856
WE'RE RAISING
MONEY FOR CHEF.

09:17.925 --> 09:20.926
WOULD YOU LIKE A MINT CRUNCHY
OR SNACKY CAKE?

09:20.994 --> 09:21.927
ARE YOU
ELTON JOHN?

09:21.995 --> 09:23.161
NO, HIS BUTLER.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.096
THEN WHY ARE WE

09:41.615 --> 09:42.681

09:42.749 --> 09:46.184
I REMEMBER WHEN
I FIRST MET HIM.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.987
IT WAS ABOUT
25 YEARS AGO.

09:49.056 --> 09:51.923
I WAS A STRUGGLING MUSICIAN,
COULDN'T GET A BREAK.

09:51.992 --> 09:54.225

10:11.111 --> 10:12.877
YOU'RE A GREAT SINGER,

10:12.946 --> 10:15.413
BUT A RETARDED MONKEY
COULD WRITE BETTER LYRICS.

10:15.482 --> 10:18.583
I REALLY THOUGHT I HAD IT

10:18.652 --> 10:21.119
YOU NEED A GUY TO WRITE
GOOD LYRICS FOR YOU.

10:21.188 --> 10:25.323
I KNOW A GUY WORKING AT
"MA'S BURGER" RIGHT NOW.

10:25.392 --> 10:26.825

10:32.265 --> 10:33.765
I GOT BERNIE

11:41.768 --> 11:42.934

11:43.003 --> 11:46.471

WEIRDO.

13:08.722 --> 13:10.054

BE RIGHT.

13:14.828 --> 13:16.961
( big gasp )

13:17.030 --> 13:17.996
MR. HAT!

13:22.669 --> 13:24.035
WHAT ARE

13:24.104 --> 13:26.905
I CAN'T RAISE $2 MILLION
TO HIRE JOHNNY COCHRAN.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.640
NOW I HAVE
TO GO TO JAIL.

13:28.708 --> 13:30.108
NO,
YOU DON'T.

13:30.177 --> 13:33.178
WE WENT TO ROCK STARS AND
SOLD CANDY TO RAISE MONEY.

13:33.246 --> 13:35.880
WOW! HOW MUCH
DID YOU MAKE?

13:35.949 --> 13:36.948
CARTMAN?

13:37.017 --> 13:40.585
WE RAISED
APPROXIMATELY $95.

13:40.654 --> 13:43.688
FALLING WELL SHORT OF OUR
$2 MILLION GOAL.

13:43.757 --> 13:45.123
OOH.

13:45.192 --> 13:48.459
WE CAN PUT OUR MONEY TOGETHER.
HOW MUCH DID YOU MAKE?

13:48.528 --> 13:51.296
I MADE ABOUT
$410,300 BUT--

13:51.364 --> 13:53.998
THAT MONEY
BELONGS TO ME!

13:54.067 --> 13:55.700
YOU CAN'T TAKE
CHEF'S MONEY,
THAT'S ILLEGAL.

13:55.769 --> 13:56.968
I'M ABOVE
THE LAW!

13:58.638 --> 13:59.904

14:09.015 --> 14:10.515
OW! OW!

14:11.218 --> 14:12.650

GIVE UP ON US.

14:22.829 --> 14:24.529
HOW MANY TIMES HAS CHEF
GOTTEN US OUT OF TROUBLE?

14:24.598 --> 14:25.763

14:25.832 --> 14:26.831

WOULD TAKE YOU BACK?

14:41.248 --> 14:45.016

14:48.955 --> 14:50.388
I'M NOT GOING TO
TAKE YOU BACK.

14:50.457 --> 14:51.623

HOW'D YOU GET
OUT OF JAIL?

18:01.081 --> 18:04.115
MR. HAT BUSTED ME OUT.
CHILDREN, DID YOU DO THIS?

18:04.184 --> 18:06.384
WE'RE GONNA RAISE
YOUR MONEY CHEF.

18:06.453 --> 18:08.219
I DON'T
BELIEVE IT.

18:08.288 --> 18:12.590
WE'LL JUST SEE HOW LONG
THIS "CHEF AID" LASTS.

18:13.726 --> 18:17.528
AND NOW HERE HE IS,
OZZY OSBORNE!

18:17.597 --> 18:21.899
WE'RE HERE FOR OUR FRIEND CHEF
WHO HAS TOUCHED OUR LIVES.

18:21.968 --> 18:24.202
I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS
STARTING OUT,

18:24.270 --> 18:26.737
CHEF SUGGESTED I BUY
A POMPADOUR HAT,

18:26.806 --> 18:29.474
I THOUGHT HE SAID
"BITE THE HEAD OFF A BAT"

18:29.542 --> 18:33.077
AND THE REST
IS HISTORY.

18:33.146 --> 18:35.113
NOW, LET'S GO CRAZY!

18:37.283 --> 18:39.684

18:41.187 --> 18:43.087
♪ AIN'T NOWWHERE TO HIDE ♪

18:43.490 --> 18:46.224
AARRGGHH!

18:46.292 --> 18:48.659
OH MY GOD, OZZY OSBORNE
BIT KENNY'S HEAD OFF!

18:48.728 --> 18:50.228
YOU BASTARD!

18:50.296 --> 18:51.996
AND NOW
HERE'S WEEN!

18:52.065 --> 18:56.200
CHEF IS THE GUY WHO TOLD
US TO DO A COUNTRY ALBUM.

18:56.269 --> 18:57.735
IT WAS STEVE'S IDEA.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.270
OH, SO
WHO'S CHEF?

18:59.339 --> 19:01.072
I THOUGHT YOU
KNEW HIM.

19:01.141 --> 19:04.575
HERE'S OUR SONG.

19:04.644 --> 19:07.011

DON'T WORRY MR. TWIG,
EVEN THOUGH MR. HAT RESCUED ME,

19:15.722 --> 19:17.555
I'M STILL GONNA
STICK WITH YOU.

19:17.624 --> 19:19.190
DO YOU
LOVE HIM?

19:19.259 --> 19:21.492
IT DOESN'T MATTER,
HE LEFT ME.

19:21.561 --> 19:23.294
DO YOU
LOVE HIM?

19:23.363 --> 19:24.695
YES.

19:24.764 --> 19:26.430
THEN RUN
TO HIM.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.799
I WOULD BE MAKING
THE WRONG DECISION.

19:28.868 --> 19:32.136
LOVE ISN'T A DECISION,
IT'S A FEELING.

19:32.205 --> 19:34.305
IF WE COULD DECIDE
WHO WE LOVE,

19:34.374 --> 19:38.543
IT WOULD BE MUCH SIMPLER
BUT MUCH LESS MAGICAL.

19:38.611 --> 19:42.113
I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU,
MR. TWIG, THANK YOU.

19:42.982 --> 19:47.018
AND NOW,
MR. ELTON JOHN! WOOOO!

19:48.021 --> 19:49.854
THANK YOU ALL
FOR COMING TO HELP CHEF.

19:49.923 --> 19:53.057
THIS IS A SONG WRITTEN BY
A VERY SPECIAL LITTLE BOY,

19:53.126 --> 19:56.394
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HIS NAME IS,
BUT WHO THE HELL CARES.

19:56.462 --> 19:58.529
ANYWAY, HE WROTE IT
FOR HIS GIRLFRIEND.

SMELL THE COFFEE ♪

20:03.469 --> 20:04.835
THAT'S YOUR SONG
FOR WENDY!

20:04.904 --> 20:06.170
YOU'RE A WUSS!

20:10.810 --> 20:12.810
( silence )

20:15.181 --> 20:18.482
HA! HA!
I WIN, YOU LOSE.

20:18.551 --> 20:19.784
"CHEF AID" IS OVER,

20:19.852 --> 20:23.321
AND YOU DIDN'T
RAISE ENOUGH MONEY.

20:23.389 --> 20:24.455
I WIN.

20:26.492 --> 20:27.992
AND WHAT
HAPPENED THEN?

20:28.061 --> 20:30.127
WELL IN SOUTH PARK,
THEY SAY

20:30.196 --> 20:33.564
JOHNNY COCHRAN'S HEART GREW
3 SIZES THAT DAY.

20:33.633 --> 20:34.966
WAIT!

20:35.034 --> 20:38.836
MR. CHEF, THIS MUSIC
HAS REALLY TOUCHED ME.

20:38.905 --> 20:41.038
I'LL TAKE YOUR CASE
FREE OF CHARGE.

20:41.107 --> 20:42.139
YOU WILL?

20:42.208 --> 20:43.741
I WILL.

20:43.810 --> 20:45.876
( crowd cheers )

20:45.945 --> 20:48.446
WE'LL SEE YOU IN COURT,
MR. RECORD PRODUCER.

20:48.514 --> 20:54.085
NO!!

20:54.153 --> 20:56.087
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
OF THE SUPPOSED JURY,

20:56.155 --> 20:59.957
YOU MUST DECIDE WHETHER
TO REVERSE THE DECISION.

21:00.026 --> 21:03.027
I KNOW HE SEEMS GUILTY,
BUT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

21:03.096 --> 21:04.962
THIS IS CHEWBACCA.

21:05.031 --> 21:06.397
NOW THINK
ABOUT THAT.

21:06.466 --> 21:08.099
THAT DOES NOT
MAKE SENSE!

21:08.167 --> 21:10.568
WHY AM I TALKING
ABOUT CHEWBACCA?

21:10.637 --> 21:13.137
I TELL YOU WHY...
I DON'T KNOW.

21:13.206 --> 21:17.441
IF IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE,
YOU MUST ACQUIT.

21:17.510 --> 21:20.144
HERE LOOK AT THE MONKEY,
LOOK AT THE SILLY MONKEY.

21:22.849 --> 21:25.082
CHEF, HOW DOES IT FEEL
TO BE A FREE MAN

21:25.151 --> 21:28.519
AND HAVE YOUR NAME CREDITED
ON "STINKY BRITCHES"?

21:28.588 --> 21:33.958
GREAT, I JUST CAN'T
FIND THE WORDS TO THANK
ALL THE ARTISTS IN "CHEF AID"

21:34.027 --> 21:36.727
AND MOST OF ALL,
I WANT TO THANK THE CHILDREN.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.496
SO WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO NOW?

21:38.564 --> 21:40.064
GET BACK TO
WHAT'S IMPORTANT.

21:40.133 --> 21:43.467
IT'S TUESDAY THAT MEANS
TOMORROW IS TUNA CASSEROLE.
