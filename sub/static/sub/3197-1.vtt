52:10.252 --> 52:15.509
Come out now. You are surrounded. Give it up, it will not hurt.

52:15.507 --> 52:20.638
Little late for that. We are already infected in here.

52:21.680 --> 52:26.937
We are not interested in you, we want the hostages, and Sarah Pierce.

52:30.064 --> 52:32.149
What do you want her?

52:32.149 --> 52:32.158

52:37.321 --> 52:41.542
On one condition, my girlfriend gets antiserum.

53:18.028 --> 53:21.157
Say something, Dean. What do we do now?

53:34.712 --> 53:40.936
When I walk, stand up and make so much noise you can. So they know we're here.

53:42.010 --> 53:46.140
- When I say. Now. Where are you?

53:50.310 --> 53:54.523

58:04.773 --> 58:07.902
- I need your help. What are we gonna do?

58:07.901 --> 58:09.995
You should go to the school house.

58:10.988 --> 58:15.243
Go down the hatch that goes into a tunnel that goes to the mine. Are you listening?

58:15.242 --> 58:19.372
I take lobster with Mandy, you meet us there.

58:19.371 --> 58:25.669

- She's here. Excuse me?

59:50.091 --> 59:55.309
- You did well to have Sarah's DNA? I wanted her alive.

59:55.300 --> 59:57.348
So do I.

59:59.429 --> 01:00:02.524
- May I? -No. Not yet.

01:00:03.642 --> 01:00:10.867
So young, with so much blood on his hands. How many have you killed so far?

01:00:13.026 --> 01:00:15.028
Why does she?

01:00:16.113 --> 01:00:17.205
Why Sarah?

01:00:19.241 --> 01:00:24.538
Every year we flnkammar earth for new and rare bacteria.

01:00:24.538 --> 01:00:24.543
A virus-string.

Sarah was breathing contaminated air in a decade without getting a single symptom.

01:00:39.094 --> 01:00:42.223
No man is capable of those exposures.

01:00:42.222 --> 01:00:47.353
But she did it. So you think she is immune.

01:00:48.436 --> 01:00:53.693
You manufactures a virus and losing her DNA and make a vaccine.

01:00:53.692 --> 01:00:56.821
- Waiting for me not understanding. -You Played with my grandmother IIV.

01:00:56.820 --> 01:01:00.996
You do not see the beauty of it. Detecting any d?dligt-

-t?mja it, and then eradicate it.

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:08.249
As long as there ?nns diseases need people like me.

01:01:08.248 --> 01:01:12.503
- People who challenge nature's worst. You're killing innocent.

01:01:12.502 --> 01:01:17.599

Mandy! Mandy! Breathe. You save them?

01:01:23.889 --> 01:01:28.059
I was spared once. I know what it's like to lose.

01:01:28.059 --> 01:01:28.065
And I am aware of the extreme acts it can get a man to commit.

Beautiful, is not it?

01:02:03.595 --> 01:02:09.819
The spores began as a simple Ieveranssystem to the virus. Vector.

01:02:10.852 --> 01:02:17.110
But they adapted and became something much more complex.

01:02:26.451 --> 01:02:27.543
Preparations?

01:02:31.706 --> 01:02:34.755
The moment of truth.

__ It is Iivsduglig. Transfer it to manufacture.

01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:31.585
Okay, give it to her.

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:34.704
Now.

- The vaccine is Iivsdugligt. -Good Job.

01:05:15.412 --> 01:05:18.586

01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:24.839
You have fulfilled your contract terms. Final payment is transferred to your account.

01:05:24.838 --> 01:05:27.887
You're free to go.

01:05:27.882 --> 01:05:32.095
You can not take me from the project. It's just the beginning.

01:05:32.095 --> 01:05:32.103
I'm afraid it's already done, Dr. Locke.

01:06:01.332 --> 01:06:05.382
This was not your fight.

01:06:23.188 --> 01:06:28.359

01:06:28.359 --> 01:06:28.365
- Why? Because I have to.
- No. Why? Are you? Sure, kid. Do you know why?

01:06:28.365 --> 01:06:31.454
- Why? Because I have to.

01:06:51.341 --> 01:06:54.469
I was not there for you.

01:06:54.469 --> 01:06:54.470
Nothing that you would not be done. Do not let them kill us both.

The world will always need someone who kills masses, Dean.

01:12:02.068 --> 01:12:06.289
- The game is over, Locke. You're not a soldier anymore, Dean.

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:12.495
- I said that it is not your fight. -You Did that to my battle.

01:12:12.495 --> 01:12:12.504

01:12:22.964 --> 01:12:25.968
Not mine.

Life is all about performance, Dean.

01:12:41.649 --> 01:12:45.825
And that's something you should know about me.

01:12:48.948 --> 01:12:53.169
I always delivers.

01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:56.255
