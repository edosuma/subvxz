00:01.102 --> 00:04.205
[dramatic music]

00:04.238 --> 00:08.809
*

00:08.842 --> 00:10.678
- My name's Jesse Hauer.

00:10.711 --> 00:12.613
I'm 26 years old.

00:12.646 --> 00:15.749
I get very loud
and very aggressive,

00:15.783 --> 00:17.618
but I'm not going to
just start running at people

00:17.651 --> 00:20.088
with hammers and knives
and stuff,

00:20.121 --> 00:22.423
unless that's part of
the competition, now.

00:22.456 --> 00:25.293
- I'm Rashelle Hams.
I'm 49.

00:25.326 --> 00:27.361
I've been blacksmithing
for six years.

00:27.395 --> 00:30.698
I really love it when people
ask me what I do for a living

00:30.731 --> 00:33.534
because then I can say,
"I'm a blacksmith and bladesmith

00:33.567 --> 00:36.237
instructor at an outdoor
survival school."

00:36.270 --> 00:38.139
And in my head I'm going,
"How cool is that?"

00:38.172 --> 00:40.741
- My name is James Helm.
I'm 34 years old.

00:40.774 --> 00:43.544
Before I started making
knives full-time,

00:43.577 --> 00:45.613
I worked two years
as an English teacher.

00:45.646 --> 00:48.082
But I got to the point where
I was waking up with

00:48.116 --> 00:49.583
my stomach hurting
in the morning and said,

00:49.617 --> 00:51.752
"I want to do something else."

00:51.785 --> 00:52.786
And so I did.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.788
- My name is Paul Walsh.

00:54.822 --> 00:57.691
I'm 47 years old
and I'm from Sterling, Alaska.

00:57.725 --> 00:59.460
I'm a third-generation
knife maker.

00:59.493 --> 01:01.662
Family's been doing it
about 49 years.

01:01.695 --> 01:03.697
I'm also an avid dancer.

01:03.731 --> 01:06.534
I also don't go to the gym, so
I use it to get a little cardio.

01:06.567 --> 01:10.204
[laughs]

01:10.238 --> 01:12.440
- Bladesmiths,
welcome to the Forge.

01:12.473 --> 01:14.575
You're here to see
if your skills can hold up

01:14.608 --> 01:16.344
in this crucible of competition

01:16.377 --> 01:18.246
and beat out your competitors
for the title

01:18.279 --> 01:19.613
of "Forged in Fire" champion

01:19.647 --> 01:21.549
and a check for $10,000,

01:21.582 --> 01:23.384
all the while
under the scrutiny

01:23.417 --> 01:25.186
of our panel of expert judges:

01:25.219 --> 01:26.720
master bladesmith
Jason Knight,

01:26.754 --> 01:29.390
historic weapons re-creation
specialist David Baker,

01:29.423 --> 01:31.759
and last, Kali martial artist
Doug Marcaida.

01:31.792 --> 01:34.195
I'm sure that
each of you has practiced

01:34.228 --> 01:36.297
forging a blade in three hours.

01:36.330 --> 01:38.232
You can knock that out
pretty easily,

01:38.266 --> 01:40.334
but the judges and I,
however, feel like

01:40.368 --> 01:41.769
it's too easy.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.537
On the anvils in front of you,

01:43.571 --> 01:45.839
you'll see two blocks
of 1-inch square

01:45.873 --> 01:48.309
by 5-inch W1 steel.

01:48.342 --> 01:50.244
In this first round
of competition,

01:50.278 --> 01:53.314
you will have to forge
not one

01:53.347 --> 01:57.151
but two push knives
in four hours.

01:57.185 --> 01:58.752
- [bleep],
I've never made a push knife.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.554
I don't know how it is,
and not only that,

02:00.588 --> 02:03.291
we have to make two push knives.

02:03.324 --> 02:05.159
- The blade parameters
are as follows.

02:05.193 --> 02:06.794
The length of your blades
must be

02:06.827 --> 02:08.796
between 4 and 6 inches.

02:08.829 --> 02:12.200
And each blade must be
at least an inch wide

02:12.233 --> 02:14.435
and include a full fist tang.

02:14.468 --> 02:15.836
Keep in mind that
in the second round,

02:15.869 --> 02:17.505
you'll be putting handles
on those blades

02:17.538 --> 02:19.573
to turn them into
fully functional weapons

02:19.607 --> 02:21.375
that will then be tested

02:21.409 --> 02:23.577
in a denim bag slice

02:23.611 --> 02:25.946
and a sheet steel punch.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.949
Once again, you will have
four hours in this challenge.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.352
You will have ten minutes
to work on your design.

02:31.385 --> 02:32.886
Use your time wisely,

02:32.920 --> 02:34.522
because at the end of this round

02:34.555 --> 02:35.956
one of you will
will have to surrender

02:35.989 --> 02:37.958
his or her blades

02:37.991 --> 02:39.360
and leave the Forge.

02:39.393 --> 02:40.661
Good luck, bladesmiths.

02:40.694 --> 02:42.530
Your ten-minute
design period starts

02:42.563 --> 02:43.597
now.

02:43.631 --> 02:46.434
[heavy rock music]

02:46.467 --> 02:48.702
This is the first time
we've ever had the smiths

02:48.736 --> 02:53.207
make two blades in round one.
- Yeah.

02:53.241 --> 02:55.276
- Definitely
a round of competition

02:55.309 --> 02:57.245
where you want to have
your strategy

02:57.278 --> 02:59.547
and your time management down.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.515
- I think I'm gonna
build a clip point dagger

03:01.549 --> 03:03.284
with a false edge on the top.

03:03.317 --> 03:04.718
There's a little more
meat in the blade,

03:04.752 --> 03:05.886
and so it's
something that'll

03:05.919 --> 03:07.421
perform well
in the challenges.

03:07.455 --> 03:09.490
A motto I got
from my grandfather

03:09.523 --> 03:11.992
was "There's two ways for
a bladesmith to go to Hell.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.328
"And that is
to hammer cold steel

03:14.362 --> 03:16.697
and not charge enough
for your work."

03:16.730 --> 03:19.567
- I want to design
a thicker blade knife

03:19.600 --> 03:21.502
with a thicker handle on it

03:21.535 --> 03:23.271
because I do not
want it to snap

03:23.304 --> 03:24.772
in one of the judges' hands.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.440
The reason why I think
I'm going to be

03:26.474 --> 03:27.975
the next "Forged in Fire"
champion

03:28.008 --> 03:29.943
is because I know
my heart's in this.

03:29.977 --> 03:31.612
I'm not going to ever give up.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.514
- Push daggers were created
for concealment,

03:33.547 --> 03:35.416
something that you can hide.

03:35.449 --> 03:36.684
So they're all about
that control and the size.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.519
It's gotta fit in the hand.

03:38.552 --> 03:39.853
[upbeat rock music]

03:39.887 --> 03:41.555
- For the blade, I'm going with

03:41.589 --> 03:44.392
a long sloping drop-point
fighter design.

03:44.425 --> 03:46.260
Toughest part of this
is definitely gonna be

03:46.294 --> 03:48.962
making a tang in
a totally different fashion

03:48.996 --> 03:50.631
than I've ever had to do before.

03:50.664 --> 03:52.833
I'm going to isolate the steel

03:52.866 --> 03:54.768
and then
I'm going to use fullers

03:54.802 --> 03:56.604
to spread my width out.

03:56.637 --> 03:57.971
Feel like I have a good chance

03:58.005 --> 03:59.673
of being the champion

03:59.707 --> 04:02.776
'cause I'm awesome
and handsome.

04:02.810 --> 04:05.713
I'm gonna be so embarrassed if
y'all actually include all that.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.415
*

04:07.448 --> 04:09.750
- The tang on these blades

04:09.783 --> 04:12.820
has to be a full fist tang.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.522
- You need to have that
very lean

04:14.555 --> 04:16.424
to actually fit it
between your fingers,

04:16.457 --> 04:19.393
before it really
starts to hurt the fingers

04:19.427 --> 04:21.362
while you're using it.

04:21.395 --> 04:23.531
- I'm gonna be doing push knives
for the first time today.

04:23.564 --> 04:26.066
I know that
the handle transition

04:26.099 --> 04:28.068
is gonna have to be beefy,

04:28.101 --> 04:30.438
something that can be used

04:30.471 --> 04:32.306
to puncture a sheet of steel.

04:32.340 --> 04:34.608
- Your design window
is now closed.

04:34.642 --> 04:37.745
Your four-hour forging time
starts

04:37.778 --> 04:38.779
now.

04:38.812 --> 04:41.582
[rock music]

04:41.615 --> 04:43.517
- Off to the races.

04:43.551 --> 04:44.885
- I mean, they're starting
off where

04:44.918 --> 04:46.620
they don't have to
forge-weld anything.

04:46.654 --> 04:48.088
But they gotta do two of them.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.990
- Never done a push dagger
before,

04:50.023 --> 04:51.925
let alone two in four hours.

04:51.959 --> 04:54.695
At my home shop,
I do everything by hand.

04:54.728 --> 04:57.965
So I'm not knowledgeable
in some of the machinery,

04:57.998 --> 05:00.334
but I know I'll
find a way through it though.

05:00.368 --> 05:03.337
All right, let's give this a go.

05:03.371 --> 05:05.706
I start going on
to the power hammer.

05:05.739 --> 05:08.075
[groans]
Not going good.

05:08.108 --> 05:09.843
- Jesse seems like
he's floundering.

05:09.877 --> 05:11.645
- He's just making pancakes.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.847
- Why'd I waste time doing this?

05:13.881 --> 05:15.883
- Jesse's blade is so thin.

05:15.916 --> 05:18.085
They're going to be punching
into a sheet of metal.

05:18.118 --> 05:20.354
You know, you need
to support that tip

05:20.388 --> 05:21.789
in the design of your blade.

05:21.822 --> 05:24.024
*

05:24.057 --> 05:25.993
- Right now, I'm not gonna
spend as much time

05:26.026 --> 05:29.062
shaping the steel
with my hammer as I can.

05:29.096 --> 05:32.666
I want my forging skills
to yield

05:32.700 --> 05:35.068
as much of the final shape
as possible.

05:35.102 --> 05:36.804
Right now I haven't
done anything towards

05:36.837 --> 05:38.606
actually giving
the blade a bevel.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.107
If you don't have a bevel,
it's not gonna cut.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.742
What I do is
what would be termed

05:41.775 --> 05:43.577
"neo-tribal metalsmithing."

05:43.611 --> 05:46.079
I keep my tool needs
to a minimum.

05:46.113 --> 05:48.682
Basically, if we get
nuked back into the dark ages,

05:48.716 --> 05:50.851
I can keep on making knives.

05:50.884 --> 05:53.153
I don't put a whole lot
of stock into

05:53.186 --> 05:55.789
that that's going to happen,
but it's always a possibility.

05:55.823 --> 05:57.057
*

05:57.090 --> 05:59.760
Looking pretty good so far!

05:59.793 --> 06:02.663
- Over here, James is taking
a snack break.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.532
[laughs]

06:04.565 --> 06:06.033
I don't think we've
ever had a smith

06:06.066 --> 06:08.836
stop to eat something
in the middle of the Forge.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.904
Paul's eyeballing James' snacks.

06:10.938 --> 06:12.573
I think we're about
to have a battle royal

06:12.606 --> 06:15.108
for trailmix over here.

06:15.142 --> 06:16.844
- Man, it's hot.

06:16.877 --> 06:17.878
*

06:17.911 --> 06:19.480
My strategy is

06:19.513 --> 06:21.949
to work on one blade at a time.

06:21.982 --> 06:24.818
It's a new process
that I've never done before.

06:24.852 --> 06:27.755
If I work on one

06:27.788 --> 06:30.123
and work out my problems
in the first one,

06:30.157 --> 06:31.825
the second one could go better.

06:31.859 --> 06:34.695
My first blade
drew out beautifully.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.964
So I'm feeling good
about the process and the steps.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.966
So I go over
to the power hammer,

06:38.999 --> 06:41.034
and it's a bigger power hammer
than I'm used to.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.736
*

06:42.770 --> 06:44.171
That was a mistake.

06:44.204 --> 06:45.806
I got a problem.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.808
I thin out
one spot in the blade

06:47.841 --> 06:49.643
up by the handle.

06:49.677 --> 06:51.812
And it's too thin to work with.

06:51.845 --> 06:54.615
[tense music]

06:54.648 --> 06:56.717
- This is starting
to indicate a problem.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.719
- Yeah. Make it
thinner and thinner and thinner.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.187
Better start making Damascus.

07:00.220 --> 07:01.922
- What to do, what to do?

07:01.955 --> 07:04.858
*

07:04.892 --> 07:07.127
- Rashelle looks like
she's motoring right along,

07:07.160 --> 07:10.230
showing a lot of skill
with the anvil, with the hammer.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.666
- Rashelle and James,
right off the start,

07:12.700 --> 07:15.636
they isolated the area
between

07:15.669 --> 07:17.505
what would be the blade
and what would be the handle.

07:17.538 --> 07:18.772
And that's a smart move.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.240
- I've been accused of

07:20.273 --> 07:22.576
being overly competitive.

07:22.610 --> 07:25.178
If somebody else wins,
I'm gonna make them

07:25.212 --> 07:26.780
win it from me.

07:26.814 --> 07:28.215
I'm not gonna
roll over for them.

07:28.248 --> 07:29.783
*

07:29.817 --> 07:31.652
[drilling loudly]

07:38.759 --> 07:42.062
- So Rashelle actually
snapped off a drill bit

07:42.095 --> 07:43.897
and the drill bit
hit her in the eye.

07:43.931 --> 07:45.165
- Oh.
- A piece of the drill bit.

07:45.198 --> 07:46.534
- Oh.
- Wow.

07:46.567 --> 07:47.601
- That'll do it.

07:48.736 --> 07:50.070
- You all good?
- Yep.

07:50.103 --> 07:51.939
- All right, she's
giving the thumbs up.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.273
She feels good.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.742
There's a tough bladesmith
right there.

07:54.775 --> 07:56.810
Rashelle, right back in.

07:56.844 --> 07:58.846
I like that.

07:58.879 --> 08:00.147
Bladesmiths!

08:00.180 --> 08:02.850
You have only
2 1/2 hours remaining

08:02.883 --> 08:04.918
to finish your blades!

08:04.952 --> 08:07.855
[dramatic rock music]

08:07.888 --> 08:09.690
*

08:09.723 --> 08:11.258
- Feeling a little dizzy
right now.

08:11.291 --> 08:14.928
*

08:14.962 --> 08:16.797
Everything's
starting to ache.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.232
Starting to--still
feel that pressure of that clock

08:19.266 --> 08:21.034
beating down on me.

08:21.068 --> 08:23.303
Feels like my knees
are about to buckle.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.173
Starting to feel like
I might be dehydrated.

08:26.206 --> 08:28.108
- As the frustration builds,

08:28.141 --> 08:30.944
Jesse seems to be
a little bit discombobulated.

08:30.978 --> 08:34.014
- Just feeling like crud,
I can't stand hardly

08:34.047 --> 08:35.916
and breathe,
everything's spinning.

08:35.949 --> 08:38.586
I've never had any
of these feelings before.

08:38.619 --> 08:39.887
That's when I started thinking

08:39.920 --> 08:41.989
something might be
wrong with me.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.958
[dramatic music]

08:44.992 --> 08:46.827
*

08:46.860 --> 08:49.162
Ah, I'm just really dizzy.
- Okay.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.764
- Everything's starting
to hurt right now.

08:50.798 --> 08:53.200
- The medic just flew in
to talk to Jesse.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.603
Jesse's feeling
a little bit lightheaded.

08:55.636 --> 08:58.238
- I really feel like
I could pass out right now.

08:58.271 --> 09:00.207
- Let's go outside.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.676
- All right, hold on.
What's happening?

09:02.710 --> 09:05.245
One of our smiths is
being escorted off the floor

09:05.278 --> 09:08.148
by the medic; we don't
know what's happening.

09:08.181 --> 09:10.751
- Feel like something's
sitting on my chest right now.

09:10.784 --> 09:12.886
- That's it.
You're going to the hospital.

09:12.920 --> 09:17.925
*

09:17.958 --> 09:19.793
- Well, right now,
our biggest concern

09:19.827 --> 09:21.595
with a little over
two hours left

09:21.629 --> 09:24.264
in this competition
is Jesse.

09:24.297 --> 09:26.767
- You know, there's
nothing easy about doing this.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.269
*

09:29.302 --> 09:32.039
- Jesse is being
loaded into the ambulance,

09:32.072 --> 09:34.274
and they're taking him
to the hospital.

09:34.307 --> 09:36.009
Hopefully, he'll be okay,

09:36.043 --> 09:37.377
but unfortunately this means

09:37.410 --> 09:39.279
he's now out of the competition.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.915
However, if one of
these bladesmiths fails

09:41.949 --> 09:44.818
to turn in two blades
within our parameters,

09:44.852 --> 09:46.954
it'll be the first time
we've ever eliminated

09:46.987 --> 09:49.189
two smiths in one round.

09:49.222 --> 09:51.358
- Hey, let's put the life
in these blades.

09:51.391 --> 09:55.095
I heat-treat the first blade
and it comes out perfect.

09:55.128 --> 09:57.364
It hardened, it skated the file,

09:57.397 --> 09:59.299
and it didn't warp.

09:59.332 --> 10:01.735
Yes, I love it
when a plan comes together.

10:01.769 --> 10:03.270
I'm feeling great.

10:03.303 --> 10:05.172
I grab the second blade,
I put it in.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.808
I heat-treat it
just like I did the first one.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.810
Straight as an arrow.

10:09.843 --> 10:11.178
I mean, I'm high-stepping
to the grinder now.

10:11.211 --> 10:12.780
I mean, I have made it.

10:12.813 --> 10:14.882
[metal snaps]
Damn it.

10:14.915 --> 10:17.317
- Paul's blade tip
just snapped off

10:17.350 --> 10:19.419
of one of his knives.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.321
- My first thought is,

10:21.354 --> 10:23.090
"Get ready to go home."

10:23.123 --> 10:26.293
- You still have 45 minutes
remaining in this round!

10:26.326 --> 10:30.030
Bladesmiths, no one
is safe from elimination!

10:30.063 --> 10:32.700
You must fulfill
those parameters!

10:32.733 --> 10:34.134
- I'm standing there
and I've got

10:34.167 --> 10:36.704
a knife exactly
how I wanted to make it,

10:36.737 --> 10:39.006
and then I have the other one.

10:39.039 --> 10:40.674
*

10:40.708 --> 10:43.143
Luckily, I got
enough room to save it.

10:43.176 --> 10:45.112
Back to the grinder,
put a new tip on it

10:45.145 --> 10:46.914
and go for it.

10:46.947 --> 10:50.217
- Paul, over here,
working past the broken blade,

10:50.250 --> 10:52.986
grinding, hopefully
not making that blade

10:53.020 --> 10:54.988
any shorter than it already was.

10:55.022 --> 10:56.389
- I'm thinking I have 4 inches.

10:56.423 --> 10:59.092
I don't want to go home.

10:59.126 --> 11:01.028
*

11:01.061 --> 11:03.096
- I'm a little worried about
the heat treat.

11:03.130 --> 11:06.033
- Heat treat's the most
important part of the process.

11:06.066 --> 11:07.768
You could heat-treat it bad,

11:07.801 --> 11:10.771
it looks good,
but inside, it's rotten.

11:10.804 --> 11:14.241
- Because I'm going
with an unfamiliar steel,

11:14.274 --> 11:16.910
unfamiliar forge
that's running hot,

11:16.944 --> 11:19.212
I'm most worried about
the hardness of the tips.

11:19.246 --> 11:20.680
[cymbal shimmers]

11:23.483 --> 11:25.185
- Doug, what do you think
of Rashelle's work?

11:25.218 --> 11:26.386
- It's got the good shape to it,

11:26.419 --> 11:27.888
but there is a concern.

11:27.921 --> 11:29.456
Is she grinding off too much?

11:29.489 --> 11:31.391
- It looks like one of them
might not even

11:31.424 --> 11:34.461
be an inch wide,
which concerns me.

11:34.494 --> 11:36.429
*

11:36.463 --> 11:38.832
- 3 1/2 hours has elapsed!

11:38.866 --> 11:40.968
You still have
30 minutes remaining!

11:41.001 --> 11:43.103
- That's way hotter
than it needs to be.

11:43.136 --> 11:45.338
I don't want to quench too hot.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.307
It might cause it to break.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.442
So I use the cutting torch.

11:49.476 --> 11:50.477
[flame whooshes]

11:50.510 --> 11:53.013
[energetic rock music]

11:53.046 --> 11:54.915
I carefully take my time,

11:54.948 --> 11:57.250
heat it up evenly,

11:57.284 --> 11:58.351
and quench it.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.087
*

12:00.120 --> 12:01.855
- James just quenched.
Wow.

12:01.889 --> 12:04.224
Fireball right in the face.

12:04.257 --> 12:06.193
- I go to quench
my second blade.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.461
*

12:08.495 --> 12:09.496
I get a warp.

12:09.529 --> 12:11.198
[dramatic music]

12:11.231 --> 12:12.966
This is bad.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.267
- James has a warp

12:14.301 --> 12:16.870
that he is just fighting
right now.

12:16.904 --> 12:18.105
- I have to
straighten that out,

12:18.138 --> 12:19.139
try it again.

12:19.172 --> 12:23.510
*

12:23.543 --> 12:26.079
I got another warp.

12:26.113 --> 12:28.148
I almost never have warps.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.851
If I can't get my warps
straightened all the way,

12:30.884 --> 12:33.020
it could bite me.

12:33.053 --> 12:35.355
*

12:35.388 --> 12:36.824
- Ten!

12:36.857 --> 12:38.091
Nine!

12:38.125 --> 12:39.092
Eight!

12:39.126 --> 12:40.060
Seven!

12:40.093 --> 12:41.094
Six!

12:41.128 --> 12:42.095
Five!

12:42.129 --> 12:43.096
Four!

12:43.130 --> 12:44.097
Three!

12:44.131 --> 12:45.098
Two!

12:45.132 --> 12:46.366
One!

12:46.399 --> 12:47.935
Bladesmiths,
shut down your machines

12:47.968 --> 12:49.870
and drop your tools!

12:49.903 --> 12:52.272
Your forging time is over!

12:52.305 --> 12:54.274
- Whoo!

12:54.307 --> 12:56.543
- I'm a little bit nervous
about one blade that broke.

12:56.576 --> 12:58.578
If the judges think
my blade is too short,

12:58.611 --> 13:00.280
then I'm going home.

13:00.313 --> 13:02.816
- I'm feeling
a little bit of trepidation

13:02.850 --> 13:04.918
'cause the width
on the one knife.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.586
I got carried away grinding it,

13:06.619 --> 13:09.957
and that could disqualify me.

13:09.990 --> 13:11.992
- Bladesmiths,
due to medical reasons

13:12.025 --> 13:13.927
Jesse is recovering
and will not

13:13.961 --> 13:15.228
be returning to the Forge,

13:15.262 --> 13:17.230
nor will his work
be considered

13:17.264 --> 13:19.132
for advancement
into the next round.

13:19.166 --> 13:21.101
However, your blade
still must meet

13:21.134 --> 13:22.535
those basic parameters.

13:22.569 --> 13:24.838
Again, both of your blades
must be between

13:24.872 --> 13:26.106
4 and 6 inches in length

13:26.139 --> 13:27.975
and at least 1 inch wide.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.609
Any blade not meeting
those requirements

13:29.642 --> 13:31.178
will be disqualified.

13:31.211 --> 13:32.913
Rashelle, you're up first.

13:32.946 --> 13:35.615
Please present your work
to the judges.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.285
[tense music]

13:38.318 --> 13:39.552
- Well, Rashelle,
the important thing

13:39.586 --> 13:41.154
about these blades is that

13:41.188 --> 13:42.856
one side has to be
comfortable for me.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.491
So that's the grip.

13:44.524 --> 13:47.895
The other side is to make
my enemy uncomfortable.

13:47.928 --> 13:49.596
And you have that here.

13:49.629 --> 13:51.364
You're well on your way
to making a good blade.

13:51.398 --> 13:53.300
Good job.
- Thank you.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.935
- Well, Rashelle,
watching your work,

13:54.968 --> 13:56.436
you really started out strong.

13:56.469 --> 13:59.039
But the thing
I'm worried about,

13:59.072 --> 14:01.141
is this blade
even an inch wide?

14:01.174 --> 14:03.143
'Cause if it's not,
you're not gonna meet

14:03.176 --> 14:05.212
the basic parameters, and
that can get you eliminated.

14:05.245 --> 14:07.047
*

14:07.080 --> 14:10.050
Oh.
[chuckling]

14:10.083 --> 14:13.053
You're literally
touching the line

14:13.086 --> 14:14.421
on the 1-inch mark
on my tape.

14:14.454 --> 14:15.388
[cymbal shimmers]

14:15.422 --> 14:17.157
So you're there,

14:17.190 --> 14:20.060
but very close.

14:20.093 --> 14:21.895
- James, you're up next.

14:21.929 --> 14:23.530
Please present your blades
to the judges.

14:23.563 --> 14:27.300
*

14:27.334 --> 14:29.669
- You know, James, in Kali,
we always say

14:29.702 --> 14:33.540
that the weapon is
an extension of your hand.

14:33.573 --> 14:35.508
Watching the way
you forge your blade,

14:35.542 --> 14:38.378
I can say the same thing

14:38.411 --> 14:40.147
when you were hammering.

14:40.180 --> 14:42.582
That hammer was a true extension
of your hand.

14:42.615 --> 14:45.052
Very impressive
for a first round.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.620
Definitely forged blades
right here.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.422
Good job, sir.
- Thank you.

14:49.456 --> 14:51.124
- Well, James,
I was watching you forge.

14:51.158 --> 14:54.394
You were really demonstrating

14:54.427 --> 14:56.096
the art of the bladesmith

14:56.129 --> 14:58.265
by isolating the steel.

14:58.298 --> 15:00.333
My biggest critique though is

15:00.367 --> 15:03.536
there is a warp in this one.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.572
- But I like your
forging technique.

15:05.605 --> 15:06.506
It's well done.

15:06.539 --> 15:07.607
- Thank you.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.442
- Paul, you're up.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.144
Please present your work
to the judges.

15:11.178 --> 15:14.414
*

15:14.447 --> 15:17.717
- Well, few things going on, um.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.420
That handle, that wedge shape,

15:20.453 --> 15:23.556
is--is really not comfortable.

15:23.590 --> 15:26.259
This has a lot thinner neck,

15:26.293 --> 15:28.461
which I like.

15:28.495 --> 15:32.299
But big question is

15:32.332 --> 15:33.666
did you make the size on that?

15:33.700 --> 15:36.603
[tense music]

15:36.636 --> 15:40.140
*

15:40.173 --> 15:42.409
Lengthwise,

15:42.442 --> 15:43.476
wow.

15:43.510 --> 15:44.611
[cymbal shimmers]

15:44.644 --> 15:46.713
That is 4 1/8.

15:46.746 --> 15:49.249
And I know that blade
broke on you, what, with

15:49.282 --> 15:50.683
30 minutes to spare?

15:50.717 --> 15:52.352
But there's a lot
of refining to do

15:52.385 --> 15:53.686
on both these weapons.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.488
Good job at fixing
this one, though.

15:55.522 --> 15:57.390
That was close.

15:57.424 --> 15:58.725
- Well, bladesmiths,

15:58.758 --> 16:01.394
you all met
the basic parameters.

16:01.428 --> 16:03.363
You will all be continuing
to round two.

16:03.396 --> 16:05.365
Congratulations.

16:05.398 --> 16:07.000
But your work's far from over.

16:07.034 --> 16:09.236
So let's get it on.

16:09.269 --> 16:10.570
- It's sad to me that Jesse

16:10.603 --> 16:12.405
wasn't able
to finish his forging.

16:12.439 --> 16:15.342
Rashelle and PW
both have turned out

16:15.375 --> 16:17.444
some decent-looking blades,
I mean, it's--

16:17.477 --> 16:19.246
it's anybody's game
at this point.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.313
[cymbal shimmers]

16:20.347 --> 16:22.049
- Bladesmiths, in this round,

16:22.082 --> 16:23.450
you'll be attaching handles
to your blades

16:23.483 --> 16:26.053
to turn them into
fully functional weapons.

16:26.086 --> 16:28.055
You will have three hours
in this round.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.756
Use that time wisely

16:29.789 --> 16:32.259
to address flaws or issues
that were identified.

16:32.292 --> 16:33.626
Once the time runs out

16:33.660 --> 16:36.129
and your weapons
have been tested,

16:36.163 --> 16:38.131
one of you will have to
surrender your weapons

16:38.165 --> 16:39.432
and leave the Forge.

16:39.466 --> 16:40.667
Good luck, bladesmiths.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.802
Your time starts now.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.237
[dramatic music pounds]

16:44.271 --> 16:47.374
And off to the races we go.

16:47.407 --> 16:50.110
Most of these blades
still need some refining

16:50.143 --> 16:52.212
of the handles,
is that correct?

16:52.245 --> 16:54.781
- Yes.
Very much.

16:54.814 --> 16:56.716
[sawing loudly]

16:56.749 --> 16:57.750
[rock music]

16:57.784 --> 16:59.452
- I will be using G-10

16:59.486 --> 17:01.354
for the handle scales,

17:01.388 --> 17:02.789
because they tend not to crack

17:02.822 --> 17:04.691
when you're
drilling through them.

17:04.724 --> 17:07.060
Worst thing is
the lingering stench

17:07.094 --> 17:08.228
of the G-10.

17:08.261 --> 17:09.729
That is some nasty crap.

17:09.762 --> 17:12.732
And in addition,
as a fun, little bonus,

17:12.765 --> 17:15.635
I have to take a warp
out of knife number two.

17:15.668 --> 17:17.070
I'm dealing with the warp by

17:17.104 --> 17:19.406
taking some of the beef
out of my steel

17:19.439 --> 17:22.075
and grind it straight.

17:22.109 --> 17:23.776
If I don't get
all of that done,

17:23.810 --> 17:27.447
there's a possibility that
I will be going home.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.749
- James, watching
the way he worked.

17:29.782 --> 17:33.453
First round,
forge your blade into shape.

17:33.486 --> 17:34.854
Take a break.
"Yeah, I got it.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.489
Ten minutes ago."

17:36.523 --> 17:37.490
All the grinding
he couldn't finish,

17:37.524 --> 17:38.591
that's round two.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.627
- So all of this nonchalance

17:40.660 --> 17:42.595
that he displayed earlier,

17:42.629 --> 17:45.198
I think, is coming back
to bite him

17:45.232 --> 17:47.234
in the John Brown hind parts
right now.

17:47.267 --> 17:49.602
[rock music]

17:49.636 --> 17:53.373
- I have no clue what the
handle material is I'm using.

17:53.406 --> 17:56.109
All I know is it's a solid,
it's sort of plastic-y.

17:56.143 --> 17:58.678
And I figured,
I'm gonna learn with it.

17:58.711 --> 18:00.447
I'm pushing my boundaries.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.749
- Rashelle's already got
her handle material

18:02.782 --> 18:04.484
kind of cut out to shape.

18:04.517 --> 18:06.453
- Very impressed with her work.

18:06.486 --> 18:07.787
*

18:07.820 --> 18:08.755
- My plan for this round is

18:08.788 --> 18:09.889
to make the refinements

18:09.922 --> 18:12.125
the judges had recommended

18:12.159 --> 18:14.327
to my handle, so that it
fits a hand a little better.

18:14.361 --> 18:15.762
When I shook their hands,

18:15.795 --> 18:17.497
I figured out what size
their hands were

18:17.530 --> 18:19.299
so I could fit it
to their hands.

18:19.332 --> 18:22.169
So pay attention to those
small details, you'll win.

18:22.202 --> 18:24.904
- Ideally, you want something
that's gonna punch straight

18:24.937 --> 18:28.208
and not roll or push over.

18:28.241 --> 18:29.476
- I'm the next
"Forged in Fire" champion

18:29.509 --> 18:31.611
because I want running water.

18:31.644 --> 18:34.347
Right now, I don't have
running water at my house.

18:34.381 --> 18:37.250
When I use the restroom,
I use a bucket.

18:37.284 --> 18:39.519
"The world's your urinal"
is another motto I have.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.821
*

18:41.854 --> 18:43.290
- So my time frame,

18:43.323 --> 18:46.426
I was going pretty much
on schedule,

18:46.459 --> 18:49.262
but I'm encountering
challenges on this.

18:49.296 --> 18:51.164
That don't look right.

18:51.198 --> 18:53.933
And I realized
the fit on the scales

18:53.966 --> 18:55.602
isn't gonna be the greatest,

18:55.635 --> 18:58.405
so I'ma just
fill it in with glue.

18:58.438 --> 19:00.340
- If she's got a schedule,

19:00.373 --> 19:02.309
she's off that schedule
and she starts

19:02.342 --> 19:03.810
letting that get in her head.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.645
You've seen what that
can do to a competitor.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.647
- What the hell?

19:07.680 --> 19:08.681
*

19:08.715 --> 19:09.916
- James has run into

19:09.949 --> 19:10.917
his first hiccup.

19:10.950 --> 19:13.386
*

19:13.420 --> 19:16.923
- So fitting up
the handle scales to my tang

19:16.956 --> 19:19.192
is being kind of problematic.

19:19.226 --> 19:21.428
I realize that
I'm not getting

19:21.461 --> 19:23.530
the scales to match up
at the front.

19:23.563 --> 19:26.199
So I start a new set of scales.

19:26.233 --> 19:28.801
- So not only does James

19:28.835 --> 19:31.671
have to get all of
his scales fitted up,

19:31.704 --> 19:34.374
he also still has to
contour both of those blades

19:34.407 --> 19:35.975
and put edges on them.

19:36.008 --> 19:39.379
And there's only 30 minutes
left on the clock.

19:39.412 --> 19:42.815
- Find something purty here.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.717
So I just finished
fixing my blade.

19:44.751 --> 19:46.686
Now it's time
to work on my handle.

19:46.719 --> 19:48.388
*

19:48.421 --> 19:52.359
The first G-10 scales
drilled perfectly.

19:52.392 --> 19:54.794
And then the second one...

19:54.827 --> 19:55.995
Come on, bastard.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.434
[d - Come on, bastard. ]

20:01.468 --> 20:02.369
[dramatic music pounds]

20:02.402 --> 20:04.337
[bleep]
- Whoa!

20:04.371 --> 20:05.872
- Yee-haw.

20:05.905 --> 20:08.341
- What, did he mess up
some handle material?

20:08.375 --> 20:10.243
- That handle, when
I drilled it, it broke.

20:10.277 --> 20:11.811
[bleep].

20:11.844 --> 20:12.912
At the moment, the thought is,

20:12.945 --> 20:13.946
"This could send me home."

20:13.980 --> 20:14.981
*

20:15.014 --> 20:16.283
And think, Paul, think.

20:16.316 --> 20:17.984
Get your head out of your ass.

20:18.017 --> 20:20.620
- The big concern here
is Paul.

20:20.653 --> 20:22.622
Paul snapped off
the tip of a blade

20:22.655 --> 20:24.391
in the first round
of competition.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.326
He snapped one of
his handle scales.

20:26.359 --> 20:27.927
And that puts him behind.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.462
- Yeah, I think it's
probably sent me back

20:29.496 --> 20:30.697
about 20 minutes,
breaking that scale,

20:30.730 --> 20:31.864
so I gotta move.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.700
*

20:33.733 --> 20:35.802
- Where are
the sharpening stones?

20:35.835 --> 20:38.004
- Jason, how do you think
Rashelle's doing?

20:38.037 --> 20:39.406
- Uh, I don't know, man.

20:39.439 --> 20:41.308
She's kind of falling behind.

20:41.341 --> 20:43.410
- The last 30 minutes,
I just finished

20:43.443 --> 20:45.912
putting the handle on
and getting it fit.

20:45.945 --> 20:47.380
Now I have to sharpen it.

20:47.414 --> 20:48.881
I'm running out of time.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.517
I need to get this done.

20:50.550 --> 20:52.419
Otherwise, it'd be
just a block of

20:52.452 --> 20:53.920
whatever that material was

20:53.953 --> 20:56.456
and a pokey thing.

20:56.489 --> 20:58.391
*

20:58.425 --> 21:00.560
- Five minutes, bladesmiths.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.429
- Little bit nervous right now.

21:02.462 --> 21:04.764
I still need to
strop the blades,

21:04.797 --> 21:08.635
so that it will cut through
the denim bags,

21:08.668 --> 21:11.871
not just slide along the cloth.

21:11.904 --> 21:13.740
- It's looking like
he's farther behind

21:13.773 --> 21:14.907
than anybody else.

21:14.941 --> 21:16.776
*

21:16.809 --> 21:18.578
- A lot of times
when you're sharpening a blade,

21:18.611 --> 21:20.313
you wind up developing a wire

21:20.347 --> 21:21.748
along the edge of the blade.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.483
Now, the stropping
is gonna knock that off

21:23.516 --> 21:25.385
so the blade is truly sharp.

21:25.418 --> 21:27.086
- I'm not used to
having a rigid strop

21:27.119 --> 21:28.788
that's glued to a board.

21:28.821 --> 21:30.723
I'm actually making
the damn things duller.

21:30.757 --> 21:32.525
I decided to go with Plan B.

21:32.559 --> 21:35.027
- Did James just
take off his own belt?

21:35.061 --> 21:37.096
- Thankfully my pants
don't fall down.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.698
So, bonus.

21:38.731 --> 21:39.666
[dramatic music]

21:39.699 --> 21:40.667
- Ten.

21:40.700 --> 21:41.668
Nine.

21:41.701 --> 21:42.635
Eight.

21:42.669 --> 21:43.670
Seven.

21:43.703 --> 21:44.637
Six.

21:44.671 --> 21:45.638
Five.

21:45.672 --> 21:46.639
Four.

21:46.673 --> 21:47.674
Three.

21:47.707 --> 21:48.675
Two.

21:48.708 --> 21:49.776
One.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.344
Bladesmiths, drop your tools,

21:51.378 --> 21:52.845
secure your push knives,

21:52.879 --> 21:54.381
and return to your anvils.

21:54.414 --> 21:56.048
[clapping]

21:56.082 --> 21:58.785
- I was able to address
most of the issues

21:58.818 --> 22:00.487
that I had going into the round.

22:00.520 --> 22:01.888
I feel like I've got
a good shot,

22:01.921 --> 22:03.990
but there's always

22:04.023 --> 22:05.792
a very big question mark.

22:05.825 --> 22:09.061
- Bladesmiths, this is the
strength and durability test.

22:09.095 --> 22:10.863
I'll be taking your blades

22:10.897 --> 22:13.400
and hammering them
into these steel plates

22:13.433 --> 22:15.402
to test the retention
of your tip.

22:15.435 --> 22:16.469
Rashelle, are you ready?

22:16.503 --> 22:17.937
- Oh, yeah.

22:17.970 --> 22:20.072
I built the blades
to be punched,

22:20.106 --> 22:22.409
so I'm feeling confident that

22:22.442 --> 22:23.443
they're gonna puncture.

22:23.476 --> 22:29.749
*

22:29.782 --> 22:30.817
- Now for number two.

22:30.850 --> 22:31.984
- Yeah.

22:32.018 --> 22:38.891
*

22:38.925 --> 22:40.560
- Let's take a closer look.

22:40.593 --> 22:43.129
[tense ambient music]

22:43.162 --> 22:45.798
No damage.
Still sharp right there.

22:45.832 --> 22:47.434
Let's look at the other one.

22:47.467 --> 22:51.137
*

22:51.170 --> 22:53.105
We got a little bit
of a problem.

22:53.139 --> 22:54.541
*

22:54.574 --> 22:56.809
The tip broke off.

22:56.843 --> 22:59.612
I'm looking at this damage
right here at the tip.

22:59.646 --> 23:00.980
You overheated it.

23:01.013 --> 23:02.148
And that's what I'm seeing here.

23:02.181 --> 23:03.783
Looks kind of like sugar.

23:03.816 --> 23:06.118
That's something that
I don't like to see.

23:06.152 --> 23:07.787
However, they are sharp

23:07.820 --> 23:10.156
and they can go on
to the second round for testing.

23:10.189 --> 23:11.658
James, you're up.
- Let's do it.

23:11.691 --> 23:13.460
- All right.

23:13.493 --> 23:14.894
- I've been feeling
pretty confident,

23:14.927 --> 23:16.529
but going through
the sheet metal

23:16.563 --> 23:18.097
puts a lot of stress
on the blade.

23:18.130 --> 23:19.899
But don't panic.

23:19.932 --> 23:22.869

[soft dramatic music]

23:39.652 --> 23:40.953
- Yeah, it's still sharp.

23:40.987 --> 23:43.856
There's just a little
tip deformation.

23:43.890 --> 23:45.758
Let's look at the other one.

23:45.792 --> 23:48.027

23:48.060 --> 23:50.497
The point has
lost its sharpness,

23:50.530 --> 23:52.164
but it's not damaged.

23:52.198 --> 23:55.134
Your edge, however,
in our sharpness test,

23:55.167 --> 23:57.036
I'm curious as to see
how that's gonna work

23:57.069 --> 23:59.238
'cause you have
a really thick edge.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.574

is a sharpness test.

24:57.864 --> 24:59.799
To see how sharp
your blades are,

24:59.832 --> 25:01.133
I will take each
of your weapons

25:01.167 --> 25:03.135

25:18.050 --> 25:19.619
- Okay, Rashelle.

25:19.652 --> 25:20.853
You have it designed to where

25:20.887 --> 25:23.556
it would be
fit perfectly in the middle.

25:23.590 --> 25:26.659
I like to use index for
more control of your blade here.

25:26.693 --> 25:28.961
But in terms of function,

25:28.995 --> 25:31.130
it's easy to index
where the tip is.

25:31.163 --> 25:35.067
And of course in slashing,
as you can see,

25:35.101 --> 25:36.669
it will cut.

but let's do it.

25:40.640 --> 25:41.741

[dramatic music]

*

25:51.050 --> 25:52.852
Well, James,

25:52.885 --> 25:54.854
your blade handle definitely

25:54.887 --> 25:56.956
is set up to where you can
comfortably put it

25:56.989 --> 25:59.626
in the middle
of your fist here.

25:59.659 --> 26:01.327
The top, the right hand,
this one, pretty good one,

26:01.360 --> 26:02.929
easy to slash through.

26:02.962 --> 26:04.230
The one on the other hand

26:04.263 --> 26:06.032
seems to have bounced off
of this area

26:06.065 --> 26:07.967
and the tip caught and
cut it all the way out there.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.937
These are double-reinforced
denim bags.

26:10.970 --> 26:13.272
So any slight lacerations,

26:13.305 --> 26:14.874
you have to have a sharp edge

26:14.907 --> 26:16.375
to go all the way through that.

26:16.408 --> 26:19.211
One blade will definitely cut.

26:19.245 --> 26:22.148
The other one,
not all the way through.

26:22.181 --> 26:23.883
- I suddenly become
a lot more worried

26:23.916 --> 26:25.217
about my chances.

26:25.251 --> 26:26.786
- But it does feel good
in the hand

26:26.819 --> 26:28.988
to move it around though.

26:29.021 --> 26:30.690
Paul, you're up next.
You ready?

26:30.723 --> 26:31.824
- Let's get it on.

26:45.705 --> 26:47.173
- Okay, Paul.

26:47.206 --> 26:49.041
Your blades over here,
especially one being longer

26:49.075 --> 26:51.110
than the other one,
didn't affect at all

26:51.143 --> 26:52.344
with the cuts over here.

26:52.378 --> 26:53.846
It feels good.

26:53.880 --> 26:55.982
Now, little blade that could.

26:56.015 --> 26:57.349
- [chuckles]

26:57.383 --> 26:58.985
- He had a little snag
on the cut.

26:59.018 --> 27:00.086
It wasn't a complete cut
all the way through,

27:00.119 --> 27:02.021
but it was sharp enough
to lacerate all.

27:02.054 --> 27:04.857
Overall, your blades

27:04.891 --> 27:05.992
will cut.

27:06.025 --> 27:07.860
Good job.
- Thank you.

27:07.894 --> 27:10.396
- Bladesmiths,
the weapons tests are complete.

27:10.429 --> 27:12.398
The judges will now
deliberate and determine

27:12.431 --> 27:13.866
which of you goes through
to the final round.

Thank you.

27:19.305 --> 27:20.673
- That was exciting.

27:20.707 --> 27:21.908
- That was a rush.

27:21.941 --> 27:23.209
- It's been a tough challenge.

27:23.242 --> 27:25.277
I mean, you got two knives,

27:25.311 --> 27:26.746
two handles.

27:26.779 --> 27:28.014
- It's anyone's game.

27:28.047 --> 27:29.448
- Okay, judges.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.450
Doug, we'll start
with Paul's blades.

27:31.483 --> 27:32.952
What do you think?

27:32.985 --> 27:34.220
- There are two
different sizes here

27:34.253 --> 27:36.823
that I had to deal with.

27:36.856 --> 27:38.725
There is a long neck
over here that

27:38.758 --> 27:40.426
if you do put
pressure on it,

27:40.459 --> 27:42.695
eventually it will
start to wear on your hands.

27:42.729 --> 27:43.996
But for what
I had to do with it,

27:44.030 --> 27:46.098
it was sharp enough
to slice through.

27:46.132 --> 27:47.734
It worked quite well.

27:47.767 --> 27:50.402
- Okay.
Let's move on to James' blades.

27:50.436 --> 27:53.239
- The slice test
is my biggest concern

27:53.272 --> 27:55.241
because I did not
get the edge on it

27:55.274 --> 27:56.976
that I know I can do.

27:57.009 --> 27:58.477
- The blade performed quite well

27:58.510 --> 28:00.179
in the thrusting.

28:00.212 --> 28:02.849
But one particular blade
didn't lacerate

28:02.882 --> 28:05.251
all the way through,
so that's a concern.

28:05.284 --> 28:07.186
- We did get a little bit

28:07.219 --> 28:09.288
of issue here with this tip.

28:09.321 --> 28:11.891
But again,
it's not a broken tip

28:11.924 --> 28:14.426
as much as it is
a "re-sharpen that."

28:14.460 --> 28:16.295
- All right, let's move on

28:16.328 --> 28:18.230
to Rashelle's blades.

28:18.264 --> 28:19.465
- She did a great job,

28:19.498 --> 28:21.801
but the tip broke off.

28:21.834 --> 28:23.736
- Oh, no, they're all
looking at

28:23.770 --> 28:25.772
the grain structure
on the tip.

28:25.805 --> 28:28.074
And that was my biggest worry.

28:28.107 --> 28:29.842
- Doug, have you made
your final decision?

28:29.876 --> 28:30.810
- Yes, I have.

28:30.843 --> 28:31.944
- Dave?
- Yes.

- Jason?
- Yeah, man.

28:44.123 --> 28:45.457
are never easy, but the judges

28:45.491 --> 28:46.893

28:46.926 --> 28:48.094

28:53.199 --> 28:54.533
Rashelle,

28:54.566 --> 28:57.203
your blades
did not make the cut.

28:57.236 --> 28:58.237
- Well, Rashelle,

28:58.270 --> 28:59.271
the tip of your blade

28:59.305 --> 29:01.007
broke off in our testing.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.475
The grain structure was large,

29:03.509 --> 29:05.311
and that comes
from overheating.

29:05.344 --> 29:07.413
A bad heat-treat in a blade

29:07.446 --> 29:11.117
will cause catastrophic failures
in the future.

29:11.150 --> 29:13.786
So it's only going to
continue to break off.

29:13.820 --> 29:16.488
And that's why we're
sending you home.

surrender your weapons.

the knife from breaking in use.

"Forged in Fire" champion,

And that weapon is...

29:59.131 --> 30:01.367
[dramatic music]

30:01.400 --> 30:03.335
The katzbalger.

30:03.369 --> 30:05.004
[cymbal shimmers]

30:05.037 --> 30:06.438
Introduced during
the Renaissance

30:06.472 --> 30:08.174
in the late 15th century,

30:08.207 --> 30:10.176
the katzbalger became
the main sidearm

30:10.209 --> 30:13.045
for European soldiers
known as "landsknechts."

30:13.079 --> 30:15.014
A dominant military force,

30:15.047 --> 30:17.216
these soldiers defended
the Holy Roman Empire

30:17.249 --> 30:18.985
in times of unrest.

30:19.018 --> 30:20.987
Designed for close,
hand-to-hand combat,

30:21.020 --> 30:22.989
the katzbalger
was often shorter

30:23.022 --> 30:24.256
than other broadswords,
but quick

30:24.290 --> 30:27.126
and efficient in action.

30:27.159 --> 30:29.561
Soldiers wielded these weapons
in deadly ambushes,

30:29.595 --> 30:31.864
using devious tactics
to lure the enemy

30:31.898 --> 30:33.065
into fatal attacks.

30:33.099 --> 30:34.633
*

30:34.666 --> 30:37.136
Its sturdy build
and broad, sharp blade

30:37.169 --> 30:38.604
made it a powerful chopper,

30:38.637 --> 30:40.873
while its signature
S-shaped guard

30:40.907 --> 30:42.441
was instrumental in defense.

30:42.474 --> 30:44.210
*

30:44.243 --> 30:46.378
It must be an effective,
working version

30:46.412 --> 30:49.081
of that weapon.

30:49.115 --> 30:51.383
- I have no experience
building katzbalger.

30:51.417 --> 30:52.651
Never heard of one.

30:52.684 --> 30:55.387
So I'll do my research

30:55.421 --> 30:58.657
and pray to the knife gods

30:58.690 --> 31:01.193
and see what they do for me.

31:01.227 --> 31:02.661
- The overall
length of your weapon

31:02.694 --> 31:05.998
must be between
33 and 35 inches.

31:06.032 --> 31:08.467
Your blade must include
a double-edged,

31:08.500 --> 31:11.137
fully sharpened, tapered blade

31:11.170 --> 31:13.539
that has a fuller on both sides.

31:13.572 --> 31:15.374
After five days,
you will return

31:15.407 --> 31:17.476

to our panel of expert judges.

31:17.509 --> 31:19.445
Only after they've put them
through a series

31:19.478 --> 31:21.413

declare one of you

31:21.447 --> 31:24.350

that check for ten grand.

too wide this way.

32:01.087 --> 32:02.321
It's 3 1/2 inches this way,

32:02.354 --> 32:03.622

32:03.655 --> 32:05.491

32:05.524 --> 32:07.326
If I press--move
too much metal at once,

32:07.359 --> 32:08.460
this'll fold over.

32:08.494 --> 32:10.262
It's called a "taco."

32:10.296 --> 32:11.697
And there'll be
a bad spot in your steel.

32:11.730 --> 32:13.432
Small bites, no tacos.

32:13.465 --> 32:15.401
We don't like tacos.

behind schedule right now,

32:19.338 --> 32:21.373
I was hoping to get
a little farther with the blade.

32:21.407 --> 32:23.175
And it could really
bite me in the butt.

32:23.209 --> 32:26.012
Imagine, it's gonna
turn into something straight.

is the fuller.

First thing I've been trying
is the guillotine fuller.

I'll have to stop and
figure something else to try.

put our handguard on there.

It cost me four hours, I mean,

33:54.733 --> 33:56.702
it set us behind a bunch.

33:56.735 --> 33:58.770
[bleep] done.

33:58.804 --> 34:01.440
- [screams]

34:01.473 --> 34:02.474
Here we go.

34:02.508 --> 34:03.542
To be successful today,

34:03.575 --> 34:04.643
I definitely need to be

34:04.676 --> 34:06.278
through with the heat treatment

34:06.312 --> 34:07.446
and on to the rest
of the process.

34:07.479 --> 34:10.116
The deadline looms ever closer.

34:10.149 --> 34:11.583
But I'm not worried about it

34:11.617 --> 34:13.785
unless I have
something major screw up.

34:13.819 --> 34:15.554
[groans]

34:15.587 --> 34:16.755
There's a big ole,
nasty warp in it.

34:16.788 --> 34:17.689
[dramatic music]

34:17.723 --> 34:21.827
[bleep].

34:21.860 --> 34:23.629
It's morning of day five.

34:23.662 --> 34:26.465
And today we've got
a lot of work to do.

34:26.498 --> 34:28.700
We're gonna finish our
our handguard,

34:28.734 --> 34:30.236
and then a lot of grinding.

34:30.269 --> 34:31.870
I'ma put this
down here like this.

34:31.903 --> 34:34.140
Then I'll wrap this around here.

34:34.173 --> 34:35.774
There we go.

34:35.807 --> 34:37.143
It's gonna look
something like that.

34:37.176 --> 34:39.311
[rock music]

34:39.345 --> 34:41.413
You know, I'm really feeling
the time crunch right now

34:41.447 --> 34:43.749
and I still have to
sharpen my edges.

34:43.782 --> 34:45.217
See if I can get an edge on it.

34:45.251 --> 34:51.590
*

34:51.623 --> 34:53.492
- Day five was rough.

34:53.525 --> 34:55.594
I'm done.

34:55.627 --> 34:57.296
[cymbal shimmers]

34:57.329 --> 34:58.697
- I'm feeling
fairly comfortable

34:58.730 --> 34:59.665
about the condition
of the blade.

34:59.698 --> 35:00.866
I did a second heat treat

35:00.899 --> 35:03.135
to get the warp out.

35:03.169 --> 35:04.903
Now I've got to get
the handle assembled.

35:04.936 --> 35:06.638
I've got to get the grip shaped.

35:06.672 --> 35:08.307
I don't have time to waste.

35:08.340 --> 35:11.277
[heavy rock music]

35:11.310 --> 35:13.645
*

35:13.679 --> 35:14.846
That actually feels
pretty decent.

35:14.880 --> 35:16.748
[chuckles]

35:16.782 --> 35:18.684
I don't want to send this sword
to the competition

35:18.717 --> 35:20.252
without thoroughly testing it.

35:20.286 --> 35:21.787
Just a little off the top.

35:21.820 --> 35:27.793
*

35:27.826 --> 35:29.261
Tastes like victory.

35:29.295 --> 35:30.429
[cymbal shimmers]

35:30.462 --> 35:33.399
[dramatic music]

35:33.432 --> 35:35.334
*

35:35.367 --> 35:37.603
- Bladesmiths,
welcome to the gun range.

35:37.636 --> 35:39.505
We've thought of
an extra-special test

35:39.538 --> 35:41.907
for your blades today
as you may have imagined.

35:41.940 --> 35:44.210
James, is there anything
you want to tell the judges

35:44.243 --> 35:45.544
about your blade?

35:45.577 --> 35:46.845
- I built the katzbalger

35:46.878 --> 35:48.680
as I would for
a modern soldier.

35:48.714 --> 35:51.250
I used ACRB-2 steel,

35:51.283 --> 35:52.684
a synthetic handle.

35:52.718 --> 35:53.852
I built it as strong as

35:53.885 --> 35:56.188
I could figure out how to do.

35:56.222 --> 35:58.257
So I'm curious to see
how it holds up.

35:58.290 --> 35:59.858
- Paul, how'd it go for you?

35:59.891 --> 36:01.660
- You know, it was a battle
all the way to the end.

36:01.693 --> 36:04.230
It's forged out of
truck spring 5160,

36:04.263 --> 36:05.731
rustic handle,

36:05.764 --> 36:08.567
and some Damascus hardware.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.369
- Let's see how they hold up
in our weapons test.

36:10.402 --> 36:11.803
Dave?

36:11.837 --> 36:13.839
- Gentlemen, this is
the strength test,

36:13.872 --> 36:15.674
the smith's nightmare.

36:15.707 --> 36:17.409
So what we'll do is
we'll take your blades

36:17.443 --> 36:19.378
and we'll lock them
into our device over here.

36:19.411 --> 36:21.580
We fire one round
from this pistol.

36:21.613 --> 36:23.415
Now, if your blade's strong,

36:23.449 --> 36:25.251
it should just
split that bullet.

36:25.284 --> 36:28.254
If not, we could
have a blade shatter.

36:28.287 --> 36:29.821
James, you're up first.
You ready?

36:29.855 --> 36:31.223
- Ready.
- Okay.

36:31.257 --> 36:32.724
- I'm pretty nervous.

36:32.758 --> 36:34.926
A bullet slice
puts a lot of a stress

36:34.960 --> 36:36.862
on a very small
part of the blade.

36:36.895 --> 36:38.664
So you need to have
your heat treatment spot on

36:38.697 --> 36:40.899
or it's gonna cause
a catastrophic shattering

36:40.932 --> 36:41.867
of the blade.

36:41.900 --> 36:42.934
- Three,

36:42.968 --> 36:44.670
two, one.

36:44.703 --> 36:45.737
Fire.

36:45.771 --> 36:47.005
[gun fires]

36:47.038 --> 36:51.543
*

36:51.577 --> 36:53.645
- The blade is still intact.

36:53.679 --> 36:54.813
I can't see any damage.

36:54.846 --> 36:56.248
So we're good to this point.

36:56.282 --> 36:58.384
- You can actually see

36:58.417 --> 36:59.751
where it left
a little bit of that bullet

36:59.785 --> 37:01.287
on your blade.

37:01.320 --> 37:04.756
There's the tiniest deformation.

37:04.790 --> 37:07.326
Other than that,
everything's still together.

37:07.359 --> 37:08.794
Good job.
Nicely done.

37:08.827 --> 37:10.462
All right, Paul, it's your turn.
You ready?

37:10.496 --> 37:12.431
- I'm ready.
- Okay.

37:12.464 --> 37:14.933
- Someone's gonna
shoot my blade with a gun.

37:14.966 --> 37:17.436
I mean, it's--
you--you don't do that.

37:17.469 --> 37:18.437
[dramatic music]

37:18.470 --> 37:21.307
- Three, two, one.

37:21.340 --> 37:22.308
Fire.

37:22.341 --> 37:23.409
[gun fires]

37:23.442 --> 37:28.680
*

37:28.714 --> 37:30.282
- I see the bullet splits.

37:30.316 --> 37:31.650
The blade doesn't fly in half,

37:31.683 --> 37:32.851
which was a relief.

37:32.884 --> 37:34.453
*

37:34.486 --> 37:36.955
- That's almost
identical damage, Paul.

37:36.988 --> 37:39.024
Again, you can see the bullet

37:39.057 --> 37:41.527
left a little scar
along the side.

37:41.560 --> 37:43.695
All right, good job.
- Thank you.

37:43.729 --> 37:45.497
- And next up,
the sharpness test.

37:45.531 --> 37:47.333
And for that, I'm gonna
turn you over to Doug.

37:47.366 --> 37:48.334
*

37:48.367 --> 37:49.568
- Bladesmiths,

37:49.601 --> 37:50.769
to see how sharp
your weapons are,

37:50.802 --> 37:52.471
I will take your sword

37:52.504 --> 37:55.541
and deliver a slash
using each side of your blade.

37:55.574 --> 37:56.908
And I'll deliver a thrust.

37:56.942 --> 37:58.043
James, you're up first.

37:58.076 --> 37:59.645
You ready?
- Let's do it.

37:59.678 --> 38:01.780
[cymbal shimmers]

38:01.813 --> 38:04.716

38:09.855 --> 38:13.425
[brooding music]

38:13.459 --> 38:15.461
- All right, James,
let's talk about your sword.

38:15.494 --> 38:17.863
Your edge is razor sharp.

38:17.896 --> 38:19.665
On the delivery downward,

38:19.698 --> 38:22.334
it was easily into the bag

38:22.368 --> 38:23.869
and slashed into it.

38:23.902 --> 38:26.472
Your tip, not coming
to an exact point,

38:26.505 --> 38:27.906
but because of
that edge geometry

38:27.939 --> 38:30.442
was easy enough to
thrust into this bag.

38:30.476 --> 38:32.544
And your blade will cut.

38:32.578 --> 38:34.646
Good job.
- Thanks.

38:34.680 --> 38:35.847
- Paul, you're up next.
You ready?

38:35.881 --> 38:37.783
- I'm ready.
- Let's do this.

38:37.816 --> 38:39.585
- After the way
James' cut that bag,

38:39.618 --> 38:40.919
I'm scared to death.

38:40.952 --> 38:43.589
And I'm just praying
mine will cut.

38:43.622 --> 38:46.625
[dramatic music]

38:46.658 --> 38:50.562

38:50.596 --> 38:51.763
- Paul, you're up next.
You ready?

38:51.797 --> 38:53.632
- I'm ready.
- Let's do this.

38:53.665 --> 38:56.568
[suspenseful music]

38:56.602 --> 39:03.542
*

39:10.416 --> 39:11.750
All right, Paul.

39:11.783 --> 39:13.585
On the cuts over here,
it starts to lacerate,

39:13.619 --> 39:15.687
but not deeply enough
to go into the bag.

39:15.721 --> 39:17.489
The edge geometry you have

39:17.523 --> 39:19.958
of your tip over here
isn't as sharp

39:19.991 --> 39:21.527
as I thought it would be.

39:21.560 --> 39:23.429
This did not penetrate
the bag at all.

39:23.462 --> 39:25.397
When you flipped it over,

39:25.431 --> 39:27.399
same thing also
with the other edge.

39:27.433 --> 39:28.867
It did lacerate,

39:28.900 --> 39:31.036
but not as deep.

39:31.069 --> 39:33.104
Overall, your blade

39:33.138 --> 39:35.741
will still cut,
not as deeply.

39:35.774 --> 39:37.042
- Yep.

39:37.075 --> 39:38.577
- Next up is the kill test.

39:38.610 --> 39:40.746
The katzbalger is a weapon

39:40.779 --> 39:43.682
that was used in history
to kill.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.784
I will take your sword
and I'll deliver lethal blows

39:45.817 --> 39:47.719
on this pig carcass.

39:47.753 --> 39:48.987
James, you're up first.
You ready?

39:49.020 --> 39:50.656
- Let's do it.
- Let's do this.

39:50.689 --> 39:52.090
[dramatic music]

39:52.123 --> 39:53.825
- I'm ahead at this point.

39:53.859 --> 39:55.561
It doesn't mean
I'm gonna stay there.

39:57.663 --> 40:00.566
Hopefully it will kill.

[tense music]

40:10.976 --> 40:12.678
- All right, James,
let's talk about your blade.

40:12.711 --> 40:14.446
This section right here,

40:14.480 --> 40:18.016
it nicely sliced
into the carcass.

40:18.049 --> 40:21.186
It chopped through the spine
into some bone.

40:21.219 --> 40:22.954
And overall,

40:22.988 --> 40:24.990
your blade will kill.

40:25.023 --> 40:26.458
- Thank you.
- Good job.

40:26.492 --> 40:28.026
Paul, you ready?
- I'm ready.

40:28.059 --> 40:29.127
- Let's do it.

40:29.160 --> 40:30.762
[tense music]

40:30.796 --> 40:32.163
- This kill test
is gonna be harder

40:32.197 --> 40:34.199
on the strength
and durability of my blade

40:34.232 --> 40:36.034
than the bullet.

40:36.067 --> 40:37.769
Hoping it doesn't warp,
it doesn't crack.

40:37.803 --> 40:39.237
I'm actually very nervous

40:39.270 --> 40:40.772
that my blade may break.

40:40.806 --> 40:44.643
*

40:44.676 --> 40:47.646

40:49.515 --> 40:51.750
[thwack echoes]

40:52.951 --> 40:53.952
Nope.

40:53.985 --> 40:56.555
*

40:56.588 --> 40:57.889
- Well, Paul,

40:57.923 --> 40:59.591
unfortunately
your edge over here,

40:59.625 --> 41:01.993
some areas are rolled.

41:02.027 --> 41:03.795
And it hit the mark,

41:03.829 --> 41:06.698
but it did not lacerate
or cut into the pig.

41:06.732 --> 41:08.133
So unfortunately your blade

41:08.166 --> 41:09.701
will not kill.

41:09.735 --> 41:11.737
- No edge at all.

41:11.770 --> 41:14.172
- Bladesmiths, the weapons
tests are now complete.

41:14.205 --> 41:15.874
The judges and I will
meet you back at the Forge

41:15.907 --> 41:17.743
with our final decision.
Thank you.

41:17.776 --> 41:19.911
*

41:19.945 --> 41:21.012
Gentlemen, I know you've worked

41:21.046 --> 41:22.648
very hard on your blades,

41:22.681 --> 41:24.149
but in this arena,
there can only be

41:24.182 --> 41:25.751
one "Forged in Fire" champion.

41:25.784 --> 41:27.218
And that champion is...

41:27.252 --> 41:28.920
*

41:28.954 --> 41:30.722
James, congratulations, you are

41:30.756 --> 41:32.290
the "Forged in Fire" champion.
- Thank you.

41:32.323 --> 41:33.725
- Paul, unfortunately,

41:33.759 --> 41:35.561
your blade did not
make the cut.

41:35.594 --> 41:38.730
- Paul, there are only
six bladesmiths in this show

41:38.764 --> 41:40.699
that can say their blades
are bulletproof.

41:40.732 --> 41:42.568
You're now one of them.
- Thank you.

41:42.601 --> 41:43.635
- Thank you for
bringing us a sword

41:43.669 --> 41:44.836
that can split a bullet.

41:44.870 --> 41:46.137
- I appreciate it.
Thank you.

41:46.171 --> 41:47.939
- Paul, please,
surrender your weapon.

41:47.973 --> 41:49.941
*

41:49.975 --> 41:51.643
- I absolutely agree
with the judges' decision.

41:51.677 --> 41:52.678
- Paul, thanks, man.

41:52.711 --> 41:53.712
- Thanks.
Appreciate you guy

41:53.745 --> 41:54.813
I mean, I just ran out of time.

41:54.846 --> 41:56.114
There's nothing else.

41:56.147 --> 41:57.983
Congratulations, man.
- Thank you.

41:58.016 --> 41:59.685
- His blade performed
the way it was supposed to.

41:59.718 --> 42:01.853
And mine performed like a spoon.

42:01.887 --> 42:03.722

I may not be the
"Forged in Fire" champion,

42:05.323 --> 42:07.659
but, ladies, I'm single
and ready to mingle.

Call me.

42:09.360 --> 42:10.929

you are the "Forged in Fire"
champion

42:13.899 --> 42:16.001
and will be leaving here
with a cheor $10,000.

42:16.034 --> 42:17.803
Good job.
- Thank you.

42:17.836 --> 42:20.038
[clapping]

42:20.071 --> 42:21.573
I'm the "Forged in Fire"
champion.

42:21.607 --> 42:24.342
I will never win points
for prettiness,

42:24.375 --> 42:26.311
but with the tests here
or on the battlefield,

42:26.344 --> 42:28.179
it's not the pretty weapon
that wins.

42:28.213 --> 42:30.982
I'm very lucky to
be able to make a living

42:31.016 --> 42:32.217
creating something useful,

42:32.250 --> 42:34.252
and I will use my winnings

42:34.285 --> 42:35.654
to make more blades!

42:35.687 --> 42:38.657
[dramatic music]

42:38.690 --> 42:41.192
