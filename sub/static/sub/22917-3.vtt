(classical music playing
over headphones)

00:33.534 --> 00:37.246
-Whoa, what is all this?
-My stuff.

00:37.288 --> 00:38.497
I thought you were a minimalist.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.040
No, Hai Lai, I'm a maximalist.

00:40.082 --> 00:41.542
I just didn't have a place
to place my place,

00:41.584 --> 00:43.127
but now-now-now I have a place.

00:43.169 --> 00:45.504
I have a home
with my girlfriend.

00:45.546 --> 00:48.924
Oh, do you remember when you
said you were gonna pay rent?

00:48.966 --> 00:51.010
Yes, Shawn, yes,
I will pay the rent.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.304
No, you can pay half the rent,
half of my half.

00:53.345 --> 00:55.014
Okay, half, then.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.599
This is January.

00:56.640 --> 00:59.185
I think this is, um,
February and March.

00:59.226 --> 01:03.689
And this is, uh,
May, June... July...

01:03.731 --> 01:05.107
I see how this is going to go.

01:06.150 --> 01:08.903
How'd you mark this rallentando?

01:08.944 --> 01:09.945
(laughing):
You have the Tchaikovsky?

01:09.987 --> 01:11.363
Yeah, the phrase is so long.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.491
If you slow it down,
it just falls apart.

01:13.532 --> 01:15.534
I know. It was
a conducting competition

01:15.576 --> 01:17.244
and, and I wanted
to impress the judges.

01:17.286 --> 01:18.662
So I...

01:18.704 --> 01:21.457
Ugh. You're so annoying.

01:21.499 --> 01:24.960
You just snap your fingers
and everything goes your way.

01:25.002 --> 01:26.921
Meanwhile, I can't find
a single female composer

01:26.962 --> 01:29.465
to let me premiere her piece.

01:29.507 --> 01:31.383
-(sighs)
-Look.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.093
Hai Lai.

01:33.135 --> 01:35.888
This is my grandmother's.

01:35.930 --> 01:38.599
I want you to wear it tonight
for the concert.

01:38.641 --> 01:39.934
No, I'm not coming
to the concert tonight.

01:39.975 --> 01:41.977
I'm not subbing.
I'll just be in the way.

01:42.019 --> 01:44.480
No, no, no, no way. No, no,
you will not be in the way.

01:44.522 --> 01:46.315
You-you-you are my way.

01:46.357 --> 01:47.942
-(chuckles)
-You're my way.

01:47.983 --> 01:50.069
I want you to come with me.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.404
Okay. Fine.

RODRIGO:
Hello. Hi.

01:57.952 --> 01:58.911
-Hey.
-They're looking at us.

01:58.953 --> 02:00.663
Hey. How are you guys?

02:00.704 --> 02:02.248
-Well, that's because you're
very beautiful, yes? -Hello.

02:02.289 --> 02:03.499
-Hi.
-Hello, how are you?

02:03.541 --> 02:04.792
Yes, she's my girlfriend.

02:04.834 --> 02:06.460
Yes, I'm her boyfriend.

02:06.502 --> 02:07.795
I'm her boyfriend.

02:07.837 --> 02:09.213
She's my girlfriend.

02:09.255 --> 02:10.673
Hi, hi.

02:10.714 --> 02:12.466
-Hailey, hey.
-Bob.

02:12.508 --> 02:13.968
Hey, I didn't know you were
playing with us tonight.

02:14.009 --> 02:15.594
Do you want to join us
in the zoo?

02:15.636 --> 02:17.221
Uh, I'm actually not playing
with you guys tonight.

02:17.263 --> 02:19.098
-UNION BOB: Oh?
-WARREN: Oh.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.684
-Oh. (chuckles)
-Oh. Oh.

02:21.725 --> 02:24.436
Yes, we're dating...
Boyfriend, girlfriend, yes.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.480
-Finally.
-Oh. (chuckles)

02:26.522 --> 02:28.649
So good to see you guys.

02:28.691 --> 02:29.817
-UNION BOB: Yeah.
-Yeah...

02:29.859 --> 02:31.277
can we go through some things?

02:31.318 --> 02:33.320
Just to make...
just a couple of minutes.

02:33.362 --> 02:35.322
(indistinct conversation)

02:35.364 --> 02:37.575
That's Caroline Shaw.

02:37.616 --> 02:39.827
-Yeah? Where?
-There.

02:39.869 --> 02:42.079
-She's my favorite composer.
-RODRIGO: Hi, Caroline.

02:42.121 --> 02:43.706
Okay, let me introduce you.

02:43.747 --> 02:45.291
-What? No. Okay.
-Yes. Yes, yes. Carolina.

02:45.332 --> 02:47.543
-Hey, how are you?
-Good. How are you?

02:47.585 --> 02:48.794
-Good, good.
-Okay.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.254
Let me introduce you
to my girlfriend,

02:50.296 --> 02:52.381
-and she's-she's
a great conductor. -Hi. -Hi.

02:52.423 --> 02:54.133
-Nice to meet you.
-So nice to meet you, too.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.801
-What kind of stuff do you do?
-Well, um,

02:55.843 --> 02:57.720
last year my ensemble performed

02:57.761 --> 02:59.138
an original
Thomas Pembridge piece.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.223
-Uh, yeah.
-Oh, Thomas Pembridge, yeah.

03:01.265 --> 03:03.893
I once asked him to do a guest
spot for Roomful of Teeth

03:03.934 --> 03:05.728
-and he told me to go to hell,
so... yeah. -HAILEY: Oh.

03:05.769 --> 03:07.146
-(Rodrigo chuckles)
-How did you land that?

03:07.187 --> 03:08.689
Um, well, we've actually worked
together a lot.

03:08.731 --> 03:10.232
Uh, because he's my friend,
you know.

03:10.274 --> 03:11.901
-He's my, like, hermano.
-He's also my teacher.

03:11.942 --> 03:13.193
He did us a favor, you know?

03:13.235 --> 03:15.029
-As a favor.
-Oh, okay. I should...

03:15.070 --> 03:17.031
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I hope you enjoy it.

03:17.072 --> 03:18.324
It's gonna be spiritual
with all the...

03:18.365 --> 03:19.783
HAILEY:
It's so nice to meet you.

03:19.825 --> 03:21.911
Maybe we could get a coffee
and chitchat some time.

03:21.952 --> 03:24.580
That would be so great.

03:24.622 --> 03:27.291
Do you want something to drink?
Are you okay? Are you...

03:27.333 --> 03:29.209
-My God, you're sweating a lot.
-No, it's just a lot of people

03:29.251 --> 03:31.045
and just a lot of you
calling me your girlfriend

03:31.086 --> 03:32.588
in front of Caroline Shaw.

03:32.630 --> 03:34.006
Come on, but Caroline
is my friend, you know.

03:34.048 --> 03:35.090
We get along really well.

03:35.132 --> 03:37.426
Yeah. (stammers)
That's fine.

03:37.468 --> 03:38.761
But it just,
in certain situations,

03:38.802 --> 03:40.054
it would be really helpful

03:40.095 --> 03:41.597
if you didn't call me
your girlfriend.

03:41.639 --> 03:43.807
So you want... what should
I call you, my mate?

03:43.849 --> 03:46.894
-No.
-My significant other?

03:46.936 --> 03:49.855
No, it's not the word.

03:49.897 --> 03:53.734
It's just, I don't totally feel
like I belong here.

03:53.776 --> 03:55.069
No, but you belong.

03:55.110 --> 03:56.320
You're-you're here with me.

03:56.362 --> 03:58.197
Bunny, you look wonderful.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.449
Well, I had to dress up
for the Pope.

04:00.491 --> 04:02.576
Although I am an Episcopalian.

04:02.618 --> 04:06.664
Congratulations on the orchestra
coming back to form.

04:06.705 --> 04:09.249
Yes, it is wonderful, isn't it?

04:09.291 --> 04:11.377
-Wonderful.
-Thank you.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.337
-Excuse me, please.
-Yes.

04:13.379 --> 04:16.423
Ms. Windsor, uh,
the papal throne

04:16.464 --> 04:18.341
is covered in tiny bites
and poops.

04:18.384 --> 04:20.219
We cannot use it.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.554
And Delgado still hasn't sent
over the new commercial script.

04:22.596 --> 04:25.516
Sharon, I'm happy you're back
with us, but leave me alone.

04:25.557 --> 04:26.850
I'm celebrating.

04:26.892 --> 04:29.061
And, Pavel,
fix the fucking throne.

04:29.103 --> 04:31.146
You heard her, fix it.

04:37.903 --> 04:41.281
Been there. That's why you
should only wear black always.

04:41.323 --> 04:44.243
Lesson learned.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.161
Hey, you're friends
with Caroline Shaw, right?

04:46.203 --> 04:49.456
-Yeah. We're drinking buddies.
-I know it's a big ask,

04:49.498 --> 04:51.250
but I really want a piece
of hers for my ensemble.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.336
-Cynthia, hi.
-Caroline.

04:54.378 --> 04:55.462
CAROLINE:
Shouldn't you be onstage?

04:55.504 --> 04:56.672
CYNTHIA:
Oh, can't.

04:56.714 --> 04:58.007
-Doctor's orders.
-CAROLINE: Hmm.

04:58.048 --> 04:59.591
But I am playing
with Hailey's ensemble.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.176
-Don't tell Gloria.
-Cool.

05:01.218 --> 05:03.804
-It is cool.
-CYNTHIA: It's very cool.

05:03.846 --> 05:06.098
Yes, um, it, we, uh,

05:06.140 --> 05:09.601
focus exclusively on the works
of female composers.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.228
Hey, you know
what would be great?

05:11.270 --> 05:12.855
We should play
one of Caroline's pieces.

05:12.896 --> 05:14.273
Oh, my God,
that would be so great.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.691
-CYNTHIA: Mm-hmm.
-Yes.

05:15.733 --> 05:17.192
Uh, do you have anything
that you want premiered

05:17.234 --> 05:19.862
by a young, cutting-edge group
of musicians?

05:19.903 --> 05:23.949
Um, I'd love to, but I don't
have anything at the moment.

05:23.991 --> 05:27.745
Okay. Um, totally.

05:27.786 --> 05:31.248
Uh, all right, well,
I should get in there.

05:31.290 --> 05:33.167
Cut the shit, Shaw.

05:33.208 --> 05:34.543
She's talented.

05:34.585 --> 05:35.627
What's the problem?

05:35.669 --> 05:38.756
Uh...

05:43.343 --> 05:46.930
("The Pontifical Anthem
and March" playing)

05:46.972 --> 05:49.725
She said you seem nice.

05:49.767 --> 05:52.811
"Nice." That's the worst.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.064
She's just,
she wasn't feeling it.

05:55.105 --> 05:56.482
(sighs) It's because of Rodrigo,
isn't it?

05:56.523 --> 05:58.025
I mean, she didn't say that,
but...

05:58.067 --> 05:59.526
Oh, I get it.

05:59.568 --> 06:02.571
From now on, no one can know
that we date.

06:07.076 --> 06:09.453
(audience applauds)

06:20.589 --> 06:23.300
Why is the Pope sitting
on my Hermès scarves?

06:23.342 --> 06:25.886
To fix the bites and poops.

06:25.928 --> 06:27.262
I'm so sorry I'm late.

06:27.304 --> 06:28.847
Bloody Pope traffic.

06:33.227 --> 06:35.687
Look, I've got something
very important to tell you.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.356
Am I dreaming?

06:37.397 --> 06:40.275
The lockout is behind us,
we're fully funded

06:40.317 --> 06:43.153
and we're playing
for a very friendly Pope.

06:43.195 --> 06:46.115
Have I personally conducted

06:46.156 --> 06:49.535
this orchestra back to life?

06:49.576 --> 06:51.954
Yes, I goddamn have.

06:51.995 --> 06:54.039
I'm quitting the orchestra.

06:54.081 --> 06:56.208
-RODRIGO: Welcome.
-(chuckles)

06:56.250 --> 06:59.461
It is great to be here,
all of us together.

06:59.503 --> 07:02.214
It is a very spiritual night,
right?

07:02.256 --> 07:03.674
Very magical.

07:03.715 --> 07:05.467
Therefore, musical.

07:05.509 --> 07:08.512
And I would like to dedicate
this night tonight

07:08.554 --> 07:12.307
to a very special person
that makes me feel

07:12.349 --> 07:16.353
magical, spiritual and musical.

07:16.395 --> 07:20.691
My significant lover,
Hai Lai Rutledge.

07:20.732 --> 07:23.402
-Good Lord.
-Jesus Christ.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.654
Because she deserves to belong.

07:25.696 --> 07:27.406
-(groans)
-And also to...

07:27.447 --> 07:29.992
Su Santidad, el Papa.

07:30.033 --> 07:32.035
Thank you very much
for being here tonight.

07:32.077 --> 07:34.329
You-You've been doing
really well so far.

07:34.371 --> 07:36.290
It's been really good.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.258
(Verdi's The Force of Destiny
begins)

07:57.394 --> 08:00.063
Look, I've been offered
a really wonderful position

08:00.105 --> 08:02.149
by a great institution.

08:02.191 --> 08:03.525
L.A.? San Francisco?

08:03.567 --> 08:04.943
Closer.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.320
-(metal groaning)
-What was that?

08:06.361 --> 08:07.487
-What?
-Oh, no.

08:07.529 --> 08:08.947
-You hear that?
-What?

08:08.989 --> 08:10.949
A Japanese corporation
just bought out Delgado.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.202
Our funding.

08:15.204 --> 08:17.831
(wood and metal groaning)

08:17.873 --> 08:21.126
-Ooh. Oh.
-What's happening?

08:22.294 --> 08:23.670
(man shouts)

08:24.713 --> 08:26.715
MAN:
Run!

08:31.887 --> 08:34.056
GLORIA:
Fuck!

08:34.097 --> 08:36.725
INSPECTOR: Yeah,
you've definitely got rats.

08:36.767 --> 08:39.019
Two types of species, actually.

08:39.061 --> 08:42.188
You got the Norway rats.
Those are in the foundation.

08:42.231 --> 08:44.483
And then the roof rats
are the ones

08:44.524 --> 08:45.943
that compromised the ceiling.

08:45.984 --> 08:48.195
I mean, obviously,
they're roof rats.

08:48.237 --> 08:51.698
-WARREN: Fascinating.
-You. This is your fault.

08:51.740 --> 08:53.533
You made this happen.

08:53.575 --> 08:55.494
You said you were quitting
and then the roof collapsed.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.746
But, darling,
I don't have magic powers.

08:57.788 --> 09:00.123
Why would you leave?

09:00.165 --> 09:02.709
Wait, are you Hard Hat Rat62?

09:02.751 --> 09:05.003
Yeah.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.005
I'm Rativarius57.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.132
-No way! Oh.
-Yes, way.

09:09.174 --> 09:11.009
I accepted a position
as the musical director

09:11.051 --> 09:12.636
of the Queens Phil.

09:12.678 --> 09:14.596
Queens Phil. It's been dead
for a decade, right?

09:14.638 --> 09:16.515
And I'm gonna bring it
back to life.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.517
Good. Good for you.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.603
Look, I don't want to be
cooped up in an office all day.

09:21.645 --> 09:25.107
-I want to be creating things.
-I'm happy for you.

09:25.148 --> 09:28.777
Well, you could be
a little more upset.

09:28.819 --> 09:31.196
I'll take time
to be upset later.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.573
God, you're sexy in red.

09:36.034 --> 09:37.786
How do you know each other?

09:37.828 --> 09:41.415
We're both moderators on the New
York City rat message board

09:41.456 --> 09:42.833
for rodentologists.

09:42.874 --> 09:45.502

09:54.303 --> 09:55.887

in no time.

09:58.348 --> 10:00.809
Furthermore,
we are the proud landlords

10:00.851 --> 10:06.440
of what I am told is a super
intelligent rodent community,

10:06.481 --> 10:08.608

10:08.650 --> 10:11.611

10:20.203 --> 10:23.332

down with Mr. Fukumoto tonight.

10:23.373 --> 10:26.251
And will we be present
for this meeting?

10:26.293 --> 10:28.462

10:53.945 --> 10:56.073
Uh, I was expecting you

10:56.114 --> 10:58.325

the ceiling gonna fall on us?

10:58.367 --> 11:00.911
-I-- it is sound, I assure you.
-(Betty laughs)

11:00.952 --> 11:02.746

11:16.385 --> 11:20.055

11:20.097 --> 11:22.599

11:31.691 --> 11:34.569
"Rodrigo DeSousa and friend."

11:34.611 --> 11:36.029

I'm gonna frame it

11:36.071 --> 11:37.280

11:37.322 --> 11:38.949

11:38.990 --> 11:42.327
One day you're dating a
Dance Haus runaway, and the next

11:42.369 --> 11:43.662
you're an "and friend."

11:43.703 --> 11:44.913
I'm really legitimately
proud of you.

11:44.955 --> 11:46.164
I feel like I could weep.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.749
I can get you that

11:56.216 --> 11:57.884
Unless you're me.

11:57.926 --> 11:59.678

11:59.719 --> 12:00.971
Funny.

12:01.012 --> 12:03.306

12:03.348 --> 12:05.350
-Yes.
-People are gonna think

12:05.392 --> 12:07.602

no matter who you're dating.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.688
Your job is to not give a shit.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.816
Concentrate on the music.
Ignore the noise.

12:15.360 --> 12:18.113
Wow, I would so go lez

12:19.906 --> 12:22.742

12:22.784 --> 12:24.327

12:27.789 --> 12:29.583
I have to leave in, like,
20 minutes. It's this thing.

12:29.624 --> 12:31.751
No, Ben, you can't leave
in, like, 20 minutes

12:31.793 --> 12:34.921
because we have to rehearse
the new Caroline Shaw piece.

12:34.963 --> 12:36.715
She gave it to you?

12:36.756 --> 12:38.592
Not yet, but she will.

12:38.633 --> 12:40.719
Okay, so this piece
is very dynamic.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.262

-Aha.

12:46.391 --> 12:48.602
I just want you to be prepared.

12:49.978 --> 12:53.565
It's not a hall
so much as a space.

12:53.607 --> 12:56.067
-Mm-hmm.
-More like a room.

13:24.054 --> 13:26.014
On one condition.

13:27.682 --> 13:30.310
I would like you to perform
Mozart's Requiem

13:30.352 --> 13:32.020
with my hometown orchestra
next month.

13:32.062 --> 13:33.730
GLORIA: I'm sure
the Maestro would be thrilled.

13:33.772 --> 13:34.981
Right, Maestro?

13:35.023 --> 13:36.983
I've never done the Requiem.

13:37.025 --> 13:39.110

13:39.152 --> 13:42.614
Well, I mean,
it's a very tricky one.

13:42.656 --> 13:44.032
He wrote it when,

13:44.074 --> 13:46.952
when he was dying
so he didn't finish it.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.537

I've never had the...

13:48.578 --> 13:50.872

13:50.914 --> 13:53.667

21:07.225 --> 21:09.602
But that's all right,
it-it's all right.

21:09.644 --> 21:12.939
Because I can burn that garbage
into pure gold.

21:12.981 --> 21:15.942
I can give this orchestra
a sound.

21:15.984 --> 21:18.569
I am the sound.

21:19.821 --> 21:21.030
Mwah.

21:22.240 --> 21:24.993
Come on! Let's go. Again.

21:25.034 --> 21:28.204
All right, everybody.

21:28.246 --> 21:29.831

Great job, guys.

Fine.

You win.

Here.

It's a new piece.

Nice work.

Take care of it, will you?

Okay, yeah, we're just leaving
now. Thank you so much!

(quietly):
Let's go, let's go.

23:14.769 --> 23:17.563
You know, I was thinking that...

23:17.605 --> 23:19.774
it's really not about Faust,
the dance.

23:19.816 --> 23:22.026
It's more about me.

23:22.068 --> 23:27.031
You don't identify
with Faust in any way?

23:27.073 --> 23:29.951
No, I had to do
this horrendous taco commercial

23:29.992 --> 23:33.246
-for the last corporation,
you know, that... -Mm.

23:33.287 --> 23:35.706
And then that corporation got
bought by another corporation.

23:35.748 --> 23:38.459
Now they're forcing me
to do Mozart's Requiem.

23:38.501 --> 23:39.919
Mm-hmm.

23:39.961 --> 23:42.338
And, um, I have to be
over-commercialized

23:42.380 --> 23:45.967
and overexposed, and,
and I just feel dry, you know,

23:46.008 --> 23:48.594
and selling my soul,
so yes, I-I mean,

23:48.636 --> 23:51.222
in a way, I feel a little bit
like Faust,

23:51.264 --> 23:53.224
but more like Faust's neighbor.

23:53.266 --> 23:54.934
Faust's neighbor. I like that.

23:54.976 --> 23:56.394
Yeah.

23:56.435 --> 23:59.355
I think we can put all of that
into the piece.

23:59.397 --> 24:00.857
You know?

24:00.898 --> 24:02.108
It's a lot of work.

24:02.150 --> 24:03.985
You up for it?

24:04.026 --> 24:06.654
Of course. I love it.

I mean, I love the hot dog,
I love the, I love the...

24:08.739 --> 24:10.283

you ask me,

24:10.324 --> 24:12.034
and how we put it,
you know, into play, you know,

24:12.076 --> 24:13.870
and-and every time
I ask the dancers...

24:13.911 --> 24:15.496
(muttering)

24:15.538 --> 24:18.291
You know? It was incredible,
I-I love the dancers.

24:18.332 --> 24:20.126
They love you.

24:20.168 --> 24:21.711
Next rehearsal?

24:21.752 --> 24:23.880
-Yes.
-I'll see you.

24:23.921 --> 24:25.923
-Okay.
-See you. Bye-bye.

24:40.646 --> 24:44.192
You could have asked me to ask
Shaw for the, for the piece.

24:44.233 --> 24:47.612
No, that's literally
what I couldn't do.

24:47.653 --> 24:49.363
Mm, because it is too much
in the orbit.

24:49.405 --> 24:50.990
(laughing):
Yes.

24:51.032 --> 24:53.034
-Yeah, exactly.
-(laughs)

25:01.876 --> 25:04.295
Why haven't you conducted
the Requiem?

25:07.089 --> 25:09.800
I don't know.

25:09.842 --> 25:13.221
Maybe because
it's the biggest deal

25:13.262 --> 25:16.224
of the, the biggest deals.

25:16.265 --> 25:20.019
But I think I'm ready
for it now.

25:20.061 --> 25:23.231
So you've got the Requiem...

25:23.272 --> 25:25.107
-Mm-hmm.
-...the orchestra,

25:25.149 --> 25:26.734
the youth orchestra.

25:26.776 --> 25:29.654
And the dance choreography,

25:29.695 --> 25:31.072
I might be in the dance
choreography.

25:31.113 --> 25:33.449
Ugh, how did I date
another dancer?

25:33.491 --> 25:35.493
-(coughing in distance)
-Wait.

25:37.703 --> 25:39.789
Do you hear that?

25:39.830 --> 25:40.998
What?

25:41.040 --> 25:43.000
(coughing continues)

25:43.042 --> 25:45.044
The cough.

25:47.213 --> 25:49.507
-Oh, shit.
-No, I don't hear anything.

25:56.055 --> 25:57.223
Hello?

25:57.265 --> 25:59.267

26:03.396 --> 26:05.982
Hey, Wolfgang.

26:06.023 --> 26:07.984
What's up, man?

26:08.025 --> 26:10.027
Are you feeling okay?

26:10.069 --> 26:12.071
(wheezing)

26:13.864 --> 26:17.410
Do you want some tea?

26:18.619 --> 26:24.083
Do not do the Requiem.

26:27.378 --> 26:30.339
Why? I...

26:30.381 --> 26:32.758
I already said I would.

26:43.894 --> 26:45.896

Wolfgang?

Come on, man.

You can't die.

Come on, come on,
it's not, it's not funny.

27:13.007 --> 27:14.592
I was joking.

27:14.633 --> 27:16.969
When I told you to go away,
I was joking.

27:17.011 --> 27:19.388
I was only kidding,
that's how we get along.
