01:03.521 --> 01:07.150
It was unnecessary.
And I don't get why you can't admit that.

01:07.233 --> 01:09.319
A trained agent should be able
to extract themselves

01:09.402 --> 01:11.237
from a vehicle unassisted.

01:11.446 --> 01:14.031
- Upside down or not.
- We're still doing this, huh?

01:14.491 --> 01:16.701
Yeah, because you need to hear
what I'm saying.

01:16.784 --> 01:18.786
I've heard you.
I'm sick of hearing you.

01:18.870 --> 01:21.539
Know what your problem is?
You think you're always right.

01:21.623 --> 01:24.626
What you want is to hear me say it,
and that shit is not gonna happen.

01:24.709 --> 01:27.212
You think the fact Madani knows
you're alive isn't an issue?

01:27.295 --> 01:29.881
Come on, she was unconscious, man.
What did you want me to do?

01:29.964 --> 01:33.135
If she was unconscious,
she wouldn't have seen your face.

01:33.218 --> 01:35.378
Okay, she was unconscious,
then she wasn't unconscious.

01:35.428 --> 01:40.350
What? Okay. Let me...
Our lives just got way more complicated.

01:40.433 --> 01:43.645
If Homeland Security enters your name
into the system, let me ask you,

01:43.728 --> 01:45.688
how long before Agent Orange knows that?

01:45.772 --> 01:48.066
- Maybe you should've stuck to the plan.
- Frank...

01:50.193 --> 01:51.393
You were driving right at her.

01:52.028 --> 01:56.241
Was this stupid, bullshit,
macho game of chicken part of the plan?

01:56.324 --> 01:58.951
If they catch you, I don't see my family.

01:59.035 --> 02:00.662
- So I made a decision.
- That's it.

02:01.329 --> 02:03.039
You want me to get your shit done.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.875
But what you do is you bust my balls.
You are relentless!

02:05.958 --> 02:09.128
You nag your wife like that? I mean,
are you sure that she wants you back?

02:09.211 --> 02:12.174
- Are you sure?
- Oh, come on, man. Come on.

02:12.257 --> 02:14.175
- Come on.
- I'm outta here.

02:14.259 --> 02:16.553
Maybe while I'm gone,
you could come up with some new ways

02:16.636 --> 02:18.721
to antagonize me with your bullshit.

02:18.805 --> 02:21.015
- Where you going?
- I think I'mma go see your wife.

02:22.725 --> 02:24.894
See, now you're trying to be hurtful.

02:28.565 --> 02:31.609
You don't have to be such a dick
all the time.

03:49.687 --> 03:53.983
So, by the end of it you're like,
"Wait, was the tiger even real?

03:54.067 --> 03:57.111
Or did he just make up
all that animal stuff to, like...

03:57.779 --> 03:58.905
get through it somehow?"

03:58.988 --> 04:01.866
What do you think?
Was the tiger in the boat?

04:02.367 --> 04:05.578
- You should check it out.
- Fair enough. Let's see the new one.

04:07.163 --> 04:10.417
So you, uh... you read a lot, huh?

04:11.376 --> 04:14.379
Takes my mind off things. How about you?

04:14.462 --> 04:18.591
Yeah. Yeah. I, uh... I enjoy a good book.

04:21.469 --> 04:22.762
What are you doing here?

04:24.306 --> 04:25.390
I'm baking a cake.

04:26.308 --> 04:28.935
- Where'd you get the skateboard?
- Why?

04:29.018 --> 04:31.979
- 'Cause you didn't have it this morning.
- Yeah. Now I do.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.110
Douche.

04:43.741 --> 04:47.203
It would have cost, like, 500 bucks
if we went to a mechanic.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.788
More, if your insurance went up.

04:48.871 --> 04:51.248
No, I know.
You're right, it was generous of him.

04:51.333 --> 04:54.294
So inviting him to dinner
is a nice way to say thank you.

04:54.377 --> 04:57.339
- It's just being polite.
- We barely even know the guy.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.299
Right, but you'll have him over
to fix the car?

04:59.382 --> 05:02.093
Okay. That's not...
That's not fair. He insisted.

05:02.176 --> 05:04.721
All the more reason
we should show our gratitude.

05:05.096 --> 05:06.138
- Hey!
- Hey.

05:06.222 --> 05:08.850
Um, we were just talking about
how grateful we are to you.

05:08.933 --> 05:10.160
My mom was thinking

05:10.184 --> 05:13.229
she'd like to have you over,
you know, on Sunday, to say thank you.

05:14.188 --> 05:16.149
It's very kind, but there's no need.

05:16.899 --> 05:18.901
Really?
I mean, it is the least we could do.

05:18.985 --> 05:22.071
I say, you break something,
you fix it, right? I broke the light.

05:22.154 --> 05:23.406
Yeah, with your face.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.575
It's a good point.

05:25.658 --> 05:26.826
- Is that the book?
- Yeah.

05:26.909 --> 05:28.095
There's the tiger, huh?

05:28.119 --> 05:33.249
I am no Rachel Ray, but, uh,
I'll do my best to make something edible.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.252
It has been a while
since I've had a home-cooked meal.

05:36.335 --> 05:38.295
Been a while since she made one.

05:42.091 --> 05:43.217
Hey, Zach?

05:44.010 --> 05:46.345
Don't... don't mind him.

05:52.101 --> 05:55.271
You know, it would, uh...
it'd be an honor, yeah?

05:55.980 --> 05:57.356
To be your guest Sunday.

05:58.315 --> 06:01.068
- Good? Good.
- Yeah. Yeah. Nice.

06:06.783 --> 06:09.994
Jamming our comms and looping the video
required hi-tech know-how.

06:10.077 --> 06:14.957
They were looking at 30 years
if they got caught. Why leave witnesses?

06:15.625 --> 06:17.210
I, for one, am glad they did.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.922
I told your mother to keep you home.

06:21.714 --> 06:23.466
She tried, if it makes you feel better.

06:25.176 --> 06:28.638
Why would you listen to her?
Or anyone else.

06:30.306 --> 06:31.849
You know, I loved that car.

06:32.975 --> 06:35.562
My dad gave me it to me
as a 21st birthday present.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.772
Someone killed it. I can't let that lie.

06:38.356 --> 06:40.525
Okay. You're here now.

06:42.694 --> 06:46.531
What have you got?
You got a plate number for us?

06:47.239 --> 06:50.910
Catch a glimpse of the driver?
Take a look at the car that hit you?

06:50.993 --> 06:53.830
You dragged yourself down here
when you should be home, healing.

06:54.539 --> 06:56.373
What are you bringing to the table?

06:58.460 --> 06:59.586
Could you give us a minute?

07:07.677 --> 07:09.804
I just led my team into an ambush.

07:10.722 --> 07:13.349
You think I'm gonna sit at home
feeling sorry for myself

07:13.433 --> 07:16.394
and let them put it right without me?
Would they respect me for that?

07:16.978 --> 07:18.020
Shit happens, Dinah.

07:18.605 --> 07:21.983
The operation was by the numbers
and you ran it well.

07:22.066 --> 07:24.777
Right up until the point
where you went Steve McQueen

07:24.861 --> 07:27.530
- and had to do it all yourself.
- What was I supposed to do?

07:28.865 --> 07:30.575
I almost had the bastards.

07:30.908 --> 07:35.622
Instead, they almost killed you.
The OIG is going to investigate.

07:36.831 --> 07:40.251
How can they not?
Truck full of guns just went missing.

07:41.085 --> 07:44.171
I suggest you cooperate... fully.

07:49.343 --> 07:53.305
You want to know
what those guys out there think?

07:56.058 --> 07:58.728
That you're a badass.

08:00.730 --> 08:03.107
If there's anything you need to tell me...

08:04.316 --> 08:08.237
tell me now, before the official Q and A.

08:12.033 --> 08:13.493
I wish I could.

08:46.317 --> 08:48.504
<span style=
"style_2" />Special Agent Madani.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.071
If you're not busy saving the world,

08:50.154 --> 08:53.282
I thought you might want
to take me out for a drink sometime.

08:54.659 --> 08:56.953
Oh, it's...
Yeah, it's Billy Russo, by the way.

09:23.646 --> 09:26.232
That son of yours...
Boy, does he remind me of you.

09:27.733 --> 09:28.901
How so?

09:29.318 --> 09:32.029
- He's a wall-to-wall asshole.
- Mmm.

09:32.363 --> 09:34.531
Yeah, I got something
I need to show you.

09:36.158 --> 09:38.919
- What's he saying?
- Nothing useful.

09:39.829 --> 09:41.789
We sure he's even got anything?

09:41.873 --> 09:43.666
You questioning my...

09:46.127 --> 09:47.795
I was there, remember?

09:47.878 --> 09:51.173
Someone from your unit
risked their lives filming this, Frank.

09:52.383 --> 09:55.762
Somebody knew that this was wrong
and they wanted to do something about it.

09:56.554 --> 09:59.315
<span style= "style_2"
/>Please... I'm not a terrorist.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.310
I have a family. Children.

10:08.650 --> 10:09.650
It was Gunner.

10:11.485 --> 10:13.529
Gunner Henderson.
He's wearing the camera.

10:15.406 --> 10:16.908
I'm a good man.

10:18.075 --> 10:19.576
Tell me about him.

10:21.578 --> 10:24.707
Look, I didn't know him before Cerberus.
It's the way these things worked.

10:24.791 --> 10:27.877
We were just cherry-picked
from the elite teams, you know?

10:29.086 --> 10:30.713
He's from Kentucky.

10:30.797 --> 10:33.716
Bible guy, liked to quote scripture.
Hell of a soldier.

10:37.970 --> 10:40.097
He knew what we were doing was wrong.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.391
I know that.

10:42.892 --> 10:47.146
If he knew what they were doing,
maybe he knows who Agent Orange is.

10:51.233 --> 10:53.861
We are a fortunate people
in this country.

10:55.154 --> 10:57.990
Most Americans wake up in warm beds,

10:58.074 --> 11:02.244
suck down coffee with their breakfast
and go about their lives.

11:03.537 --> 11:04.831
And good for them.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.166
They deserve that life.

11:08.417 --> 11:11.754
They deserve it not because
they earned it as individuals...

11:12.629 --> 11:17.509
but because we've earned it as a nation.
As a people.

11:19.511 --> 11:22.306
But not all of us
get to take that life for granted.

11:23.307 --> 11:28.312
Our job at the CIA is to identify
and contain any dangers to it.

11:30.064 --> 11:34.736
It's a job that's not always clean,
or pretty, or fun.

11:36.821 --> 11:38.447
I've watched friends die...

11:39.698 --> 11:42.076
and I've left good men behind
in shitty countries

11:42.159 --> 11:44.620
because that was the home
they were born to.

11:46.538 --> 11:49.541
I don't know a single operative
with any years under their belt

11:49.625 --> 11:52.670
who hasn't had to do something
that gave them nightmares.

11:54.756 --> 11:56.799
But we endure those nightmares...

11:58.259 --> 11:59.844
embrace them, even...

12:00.469 --> 12:03.389
so that the rest of America
can sleep peacefully.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.475
That's why you're here.

12:09.561 --> 12:11.480
My name is William Rawlins.

12:12.857 --> 12:14.566
Welcome to the CIA.

12:24.911 --> 12:25.912
Miss Page.

12:27.079 --> 12:30.124
I'm Acting SAC Dinah Madani.
So sorry to keep you waiting.

12:30.207 --> 12:33.794
Oh, no. Figured it's something you do,
a little gentle intimidation.

12:33.878 --> 12:36.297
Why would I want to intimidate you,
Miss Page?

12:36.380 --> 12:38.800
- Please.
- Thank you. It's Karen.

12:40.968 --> 12:42.678
You look like you're in pain,
Agent Madani.

12:43.804 --> 12:46.140
- Oh, I'm fine.
- It wouldn't have anything to do

12:46.223 --> 12:47.975
with the incident at the docks, would it?

12:48.684 --> 12:51.813
A car exploded, your car,
according to the, uh, license plate,

12:51.896 --> 12:54.690
but, uh, there was no police report,
which seems odd.

12:54.773 --> 12:56.275
You're very well-informed.

12:56.942 --> 12:59.028
I imagine our jobs aren't dissimilar
in that respect.

12:59.111 --> 13:02.114
- We're only as good as our information.
- Is it a story you intend to run?

13:03.074 --> 13:05.451
Maybe. I don't know enough yet.

13:06.118 --> 13:07.786
Would you care to comment?

13:12.624 --> 13:15.962
Karen, you strike me as someone
people would tend to trust.

13:16.045 --> 13:17.754
I'd like to think I could do the same.

13:18.339 --> 13:20.132
Uh, trust me to do what?

13:20.216 --> 13:23.219
Not to report anything
until the full story is clear.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.557
Did you trust Carson Wolf?

13:30.726 --> 13:31.978
Off the record?

13:33.645 --> 13:34.645
Of course.

13:35.857 --> 13:39.610
Wolf was dirty.
Most likely that's what got him killed.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.654
That stays between us, of course,

13:42.738 --> 13:45.241
though I suspect
you knew most of that already.

13:46.158 --> 13:48.619
- Who told you?
- Mmm.

13:48.702 --> 13:52.665
- Do you have any idea who killed him?
- No, I... Why would I?

13:57.962 --> 14:00.047
Quite a time you've had
since you came to New York.

14:01.173 --> 14:04.510
Accused of murder.
Helped bring down Wilson Fisk.

14:04.593 --> 14:07.013
First you're a paralegal,
then a journalist.

14:08.805 --> 14:12.268
Would you say you have a tendency
to get over-involved, Karen?

14:13.727 --> 14:15.229
Depends on what you mean.

14:18.065 --> 14:19.650
Frank Castle, for instance.

14:21.277 --> 14:24.738
You were part of his defense team,
a fierce advocate for the man.

14:24.821 --> 14:26.115
Then when he escaped prison,

14:26.198 --> 14:28.993
he kidnapped you
from under police protection.

14:29.243 --> 14:31.123
Yet here you sit, alive and well.

14:31.203 --> 14:34.498
- I had nothing to fear from Frank Castle.
- He killed a lot of people.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.251
You ask me...

14:37.960 --> 14:41.255
the story of Frank Castle's a tragedy.
No one comes out of that well.

14:42.924 --> 14:44.383
Is that why I'm here?

14:45.801 --> 14:48.012
Talk about old cases and a dead man?

14:54.560 --> 14:57.354
Did he ever talk to you
about his time in Afghanistan?

14:58.189 --> 14:59.398
Kandahar?

15:01.817 --> 15:05.237
Agent Madani,
what exactly happened on the docks?

15:05.321 --> 15:07.907
You know, I was in Kandahar myself
before this.

15:08.699 --> 15:11.660
Turns out Castle might have been the man
I needed to talk to.

15:13.204 --> 15:15.497
Yeah, well, then it's a shame
that he's dead.

15:16.790 --> 15:17.790
Yeah.

15:20.836 --> 15:23.255
What kind of a man was he?

15:24.715 --> 15:27.009
Decent. Honest.

15:28.135 --> 15:30.012
He had a code and a sense of honor.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.599
What do you think he'd be doing
if he were still alive?

15:36.310 --> 15:38.062
Minding his own business.

15:40.064 --> 15:43.692
Frank was a man better left alone,
Agent Madani.

15:45.152 --> 15:48.530
Maybe we can grant him that,
now that he's gone.

15:58.874 --> 16:00.250
You wanted to see me?

16:01.210 --> 16:04.421
I want you to track down
the whereabouts of all these men.

16:07.007 --> 16:09.802
This have something to do
with the missing guns?

16:10.344 --> 16:12.471
It's a list of soldiers
who might've been in the room

16:12.554 --> 16:14.181
when Ahmad Zubair was executed.

16:14.265 --> 16:15.807
I narrowed it down as best I could.

16:15.891 --> 16:17.893
The operation in Kandahar
was off the books,

16:17.977 --> 16:20.687
so there's no record of the team
actually being there.

16:20.771 --> 16:21.811
But since they were there,

16:21.855 --> 16:24.275
it means there's also no record of them
being anywhere else.

16:26.318 --> 16:31.157
Frank Castle, Edward Drogin,
Gunner Henderson.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.825
Who names their kid Gunner?

16:34.994 --> 16:36.870
There's gotta be 20 names on here.

16:37.496 --> 16:39.540
Yeah. I'm banking on one of them
knowing something.

16:42.584 --> 16:46.838
You know... major shit just went down.

16:48.049 --> 16:49.966
We got left holding our asses
in our hands.

16:50.051 --> 16:52.053
OIG's coming in to grill us
on our failures.

16:52.136 --> 16:53.721
And you... What are you doing?

16:54.555 --> 16:58.392
You're chasing down a case about dead men
that no one cares about.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.019
I'm sorry, but no.

17:01.187 --> 17:04.606
I'm not doing this. Not now.
And neither should you.

17:13.906 --> 17:14.950
Hey.

17:20.497 --> 17:22.874
Frank Castle stole those guns.

17:25.001 --> 17:27.921
You know, I think maybe you should go back
to the hospital. Okay?

17:28.003 --> 17:31.175
He stood right over me.
He looked me in the face.

17:32.676 --> 17:36.305
So you're telling me
the Punisher is not only alive,

17:36.388 --> 17:39.600
but he just stole a truck full of guns
from under our noses?

17:40.059 --> 17:41.893
Castle pulled me out of my car.

17:43.520 --> 17:45.481
Why would the Punisher save my life?

17:45.564 --> 17:49.193
He looked right at me and said,
"Stay out of my way, Madani."

17:49.276 --> 17:52.028
What does that mean? What is he chasing?

17:53.947 --> 17:56.367
Well, whatever it is...

17:56.450 --> 17:59.661
with the arsenal he just stole,
you can bet he's gonna drop some bodies.

17:59.745 --> 18:03.874
Now you want that on your conscience?
Tell OIG. Get out ahead of this thing.

18:03.957 --> 18:05.852
The fact he's alive means
your case has validity.

18:05.876 --> 18:07.503
I'm not going public with this.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.339
Well, that's your call.

18:11.047 --> 18:14.260
But they ask me a direct question about it
in an official Q and A?

18:15.636 --> 18:16.845
I'm not gonna lie.

18:21.975 --> 18:24.121
Yeah. I'm banking on one of them
knowing something.

18:25.896 --> 18:30.651
Frank Castle, Edward Drogin,
Gunner Henderson.

18:31.152 --> 18:33.904
Who names their kid Gunner?

18:35.906 --> 18:39.326
Edward Drogin, Gunner Henderson.

18:39.910 --> 18:41.662
There's gotta be 20 names on here.

18:41.745 --> 18:44.373
Yeah. I'm banking on one of them
knowing something.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.089
Frank, you got mail.

19:06.102 --> 19:07.229
I'll be back.

19:08.855 --> 19:11.066
You gonna tell me how Karen Page fits in?

19:11.150 --> 19:12.484
- Nope.
- Right.

19:14.361 --> 19:16.488
Well, we could use some milk.

19:17.239 --> 19:20.534
And some 1/16th solder tips.

19:39.928 --> 19:42.806
- Hey.
- So I had an interesting day.

19:44.641 --> 19:47.603
The, uh, special agent in charge

19:47.686 --> 19:50.772
of Homeland Security investigations
called me up.

19:51.815 --> 19:56.445
- Guess who she wanted to talk about?
- Yeah. So you met Madani, huh?

19:58.989 --> 20:00.657
I think she knows you're alive.

20:01.825 --> 20:04.953
I pulled her out of a...
a burning car, so...

20:07.122 --> 20:08.624
She was also upside down.

20:09.666 --> 20:11.460
Then I guess you kinda had to, didn't you?

20:11.543 --> 20:12.669
I guess.

20:15.714 --> 20:18.967
Did you have anything to do
with that upside down burning car?

20:21.178 --> 20:22.346
Kinda.

20:27.309 --> 20:29.436
Take it David Lieberman had, uh...

20:30.687 --> 20:33.148
- the answers you were looking for?
- Some.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.777
Same people who came after me
came after him.

20:38.445 --> 20:40.989
- Is he alive?
- He was smart.

20:41.948 --> 20:44.117
Got out ahead of it. Played possum.

20:47.329 --> 20:49.790
He kept his family safe, Karen.

20:53.627 --> 20:55.003
You know, I've been...

20:57.673 --> 20:59.466
thinking about my son, Frankie.

21:00.551 --> 21:05.055
I remember, second to last deployment
ended unexpectedly, right?

21:05.138 --> 21:08.267
So I got to come home, you know.
Wanted to surprise them.

21:09.393 --> 21:12.103
I pull up in the driveway
and I hear all this shouting,

21:12.187 --> 21:13.981
this yelling from inside.

21:14.064 --> 21:16.525
I remember thinking, "Oh, boy.
What'd the kid do now?" Right?

21:16.608 --> 21:20.362
"I mean, he's barely
eight years old. How bad could it be?"

21:21.154 --> 21:23.073
But I walk in the house...

21:24.575 --> 21:27.494
and he's painted this marine on the wall.

21:28.495 --> 21:31.873
You know, he didn't draw it, Karen.
He painted it.

21:33.584 --> 21:34.835
It's huge.

21:34.918 --> 21:37.629
You know, it takes up half the wall and...

21:38.714 --> 21:40.674
it was pretty good, too.

21:49.891 --> 21:51.602
I dragged him outside.

21:52.436 --> 21:54.646
I put him on the ground.
I had a finger in his face.

21:55.606 --> 21:57.232
So I asked him. I said...

21:58.483 --> 22:00.319
I said, "What the hell were you thinking?"

22:01.277 --> 22:05.741
He looked up at me... like a little man...

22:07.409 --> 22:09.828
He said,
"Marines scare off bad guys, Daddy.

22:12.664 --> 22:15.459
When you're not here,
it's my job to protect our girls."

22:20.005 --> 22:21.882
They were better off without me, Karen.

22:24.593 --> 22:26.052
And me being with them...

22:27.721 --> 22:30.223
me being by their side, it got 'em killed.

22:32.476 --> 22:34.185
I need to find...

22:34.269 --> 22:37.814
I need to find these bastards
that took 'em from me. I gotta kill 'em.

22:46.782 --> 22:49.075
So where does that end, Frank?

22:51.036 --> 22:52.871
Because I look at you and...

22:53.705 --> 23:00.546
my heart breaks because all I can see
is just this endless, echoing loneliness.

23:01.004 --> 23:03.840
- I'm not lonely, Karen.
- Bullshit. We are all lonely.

23:03.924 --> 23:06.468
I sometimes think that
that is all that life is, we're just...

23:06.552 --> 23:08.845
We're just fighting not to be alone.

23:08.929 --> 23:11.306
So what do you want?
What should I do? Should I let it go?

23:11.389 --> 23:14.350
No, but I want there to be an after.
For you.

23:14.935 --> 23:18.605
Say that these men die, right?
You get what you want.

23:18.689 --> 23:21.858
They'll paint them as martyrs, Frank.
Is that what you want?

23:21.942 --> 23:24.611
You want to turn these...
these scumbags into heroes

23:24.695 --> 23:26.196
with no one knowing what they were?

23:26.279 --> 23:29.199
- What's the alternative? What should I do?
- You expose them.

23:29.700 --> 23:32.035
Right, you talk to Madani. Or you tell me.

23:32.118 --> 23:34.663
Right, I write a story about it.
We let the truth hang them.

23:34.746 --> 23:36.289
These men decide what the truth is.

23:36.372 --> 23:37.499
- You don't get to.
- They...

23:37.583 --> 23:39.334
You don't get to do that!

23:39.418 --> 23:40.544
Now, look, I...

23:41.670 --> 23:43.922
I can't go after these men
and keep you safe.

23:44.005 --> 23:45.340
- I can't...
- You don't need to.

23:45.423 --> 23:46.592
What do you mean?

23:46.675 --> 23:50.762
My family's gone 'cause of what I know.
They're gone!

23:56.017 --> 23:57.143
Karen, I...

23:58.144 --> 23:59.187
Hey.

24:00.981 --> 24:03.817
I cannot let that happen to you,
you got that?

24:06.820 --> 24:08.655
I cannot let that happen.

24:09.740 --> 24:10.782
Please.

24:23.336 --> 24:26.131
What went wrong, Agent Madani?

24:26.422 --> 24:28.842
Someone knew about the arms deal
and hijacked it.

24:28.925 --> 24:31.762
Was that a failing
in your mission planning and execution?

24:31.845 --> 24:32.971
Not in my opinion.

24:33.054 --> 24:34.973
There's nothing
you might have done differently?

24:35.849 --> 24:36.850
With hindsight, sure.

24:36.933 --> 24:40.646
Did any tactical conversations
take place outside of this office?

24:42.022 --> 24:44.024
- Not to my knowledge.
- No.

24:44.107 --> 24:46.610
- Who designed the tactical plan?
- I did.

24:46.693 --> 24:48.194
And you were confident in this plan?

24:48.278 --> 24:50.446
These questions are ridiculous,
if I may say so.

24:50.531 --> 24:54.117
Did either of the agents
from the follow car see this suspect?

24:54.493 --> 24:55.702
You haven't asked them?

24:55.786 --> 24:58.454
I understand you might resent
these questions, Agent Madani,

24:58.539 --> 25:00.373
but please answer them.

25:01.542 --> 25:03.209
Not to my knowledge.

25:03.293 --> 25:07.631
- And you chased the perpetrators?
- Almost caught 'em, too.

25:08.006 --> 25:10.717
But you still have no knowledge
who they might be?

25:11.843 --> 25:13.011
No, I do not.

25:15.931 --> 25:17.515
Agent Stein?

25:18.475 --> 25:19.559
Sorry.

25:20.101 --> 25:22.270
Do you have any suspects?

26:04.229 --> 26:05.563
Shit!

26:06.982 --> 26:09.818
Shit!

26:09.901 --> 26:12.904
You damn well knew I wouldn't tell.

26:15.991 --> 26:17.200
Look...

26:18.785 --> 26:21.037
we find Castle's unit,
the men on that list,

26:21.121 --> 26:23.289
and hopefully they can give us Castle.

26:25.792 --> 26:27.043
Here's my condition.

26:27.127 --> 26:30.756
You get a week. A week
to find Castle or some kind of evidence.

26:30.839 --> 26:35.135
If we don't have anything,
then I'll go to Hernandez myself.

26:35.677 --> 26:37.178
For both our sakes.

26:45.270 --> 26:48.064
In recognition
of outstanding services in the field,

26:48.148 --> 26:51.526
despite great danger
and serious personal injury,

26:51.609 --> 26:56.531
it is my honor to present you
with the Distinguished Intelligence Medal.

26:59.910 --> 27:02.620
Congratulations. Tell no one.

27:02.704 --> 27:04.831
Thank you, ma'am.

27:05.331 --> 27:07.042
You may not have the medal,

27:07.125 --> 27:10.128
but all of our admiration,
that is yours to keep.

27:10.211 --> 27:12.756
Well, all it cost me was an eye.

27:12.839 --> 27:15.467
Well, it cost our enemies
a hell of a lot more than that.

27:16.009 --> 27:19.554
Your sacrifices took some
very heavy targets out of the game, Bill.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.681
For that, you should be very, very proud.

27:21.848 --> 27:24.059
I'm keen to help wherever I can.

27:25.560 --> 27:27.813
- You gonna be around a while?
- Sure.

27:27.896 --> 27:29.898
- Drop by and see me later.
- Will do.

27:29.981 --> 27:31.692
Yeah. How 'bout this guy?

27:33.735 --> 27:36.738
He's quite something, your man, Gunner.

27:37.488 --> 27:38.907
Completely off the grid.

27:38.990 --> 27:42.118
You know, no electricity,
no phone, no Internet.

27:42.202 --> 27:45.163
No running water.
How the hell you live without that?

27:45.246 --> 27:47.165
Yeah. Maybe he's got a well.

27:48.041 --> 27:49.960
Like most other people on the planet.

27:50.043 --> 27:53.504
- Huh. Never thought of that.
- There's a shocker.

27:53.588 --> 27:58.218
Only thing in the system is the deed
to his family's land and the cabin on it.

27:58.301 --> 28:03.139
Point being, this is a man who is,
you know, hiding from the world.

28:03.223 --> 28:04.575
Maybe he just doesn't like it.

28:04.599 --> 28:06.359
What's he gonna say
when you show up?

28:06.810 --> 28:10.021
- Is he gonna welcome you with open arms?
- Just write the address down.

28:10.105 --> 28:11.982
Put it on a piece of paper.
Put it on the dash.

28:12.065 --> 28:14.567
- I'm coming with you.
- You can forget about it.

28:14.650 --> 28:17.528
No, no, no, no.
"Forget about it." That's bullshit.

28:17.612 --> 28:19.447
- Forget about it.
- No way!

28:19.781 --> 28:22.941
You know what? You're just pissed off
about the other night because deep down...

28:22.993 --> 28:25.703
No! Deep down, you know that I'm right.

28:25.787 --> 28:28.206
You can't agree to work with someone
and then cut them out.

28:28.289 --> 28:30.041
Okay. I want you to listen carefully.

28:30.125 --> 28:31.960
- This guy, he is no joke.
- Okay.

28:32.043 --> 28:35.338
Look, if he doesn't want us there,
I do not have time to look after you.

28:36.506 --> 28:38.258
You won't even know I'm there.

28:39.926 --> 28:41.428
I'll help with the driving.

28:41.845 --> 28:45.974
Get you there all, you know,
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

28:52.898 --> 28:55.275
The Kandahar operation, all right...

28:56.401 --> 29:00.655
was, as you know, named... for Cerberus.

29:01.572 --> 29:06.452
Hellhound, multi-headed guard dog
of the underworld.

29:06.536 --> 29:09.164
Which sounds really scary, right?

29:09.706 --> 29:15.086
But Cerberus comes from "Kerberos,"
I think. Greek.

29:15.170 --> 29:16.379
Jesus Christ.

29:16.462 --> 29:18.381
Which means "spotted."

29:18.464 --> 29:22.052
So, Hades, you know, Lord of the Dead...

29:23.136 --> 29:25.764
literally named his dog Spot.

29:26.014 --> 29:30.268
And you and Gunner, many years later...

29:30.351 --> 29:32.145
...were part of Operation Spot.

29:32.228 --> 29:33.730
You almost done with that?

29:33.980 --> 29:38.234
- Yeah. It says "mix thoroughly."
- It's fine, all right?

29:39.945 --> 29:41.822
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

29:41.905 --> 29:43.281
Want me to drive while you eat?

29:43.364 --> 29:44.574
No, I got it.

30:00.173 --> 30:01.466
Where'd you get that?

30:02.717 --> 30:05.470
- I made this.
- What do you mean, you made it?

30:06.262 --> 30:09.265
- Did you make me one?
- No.

30:10.975 --> 30:13.269
This stuff was all in the fridge,
you know?

30:15.771 --> 30:17.148
I thought you liked those things.

30:35.041 --> 30:37.168
Hey. Perfect timing.

30:37.418 --> 30:40.922
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah, thanks for stopping by. Scotch?

30:41.381 --> 30:44.509
Knowing what you keep on hand,
I'd be a fool to say no.

30:44.592 --> 30:45.718
Good answer.

30:47.220 --> 30:49.014
Well, it's quite a day, huh?

30:49.097 --> 30:51.349
Yes, and I'm humbled by it.

30:51.432 --> 30:53.726
Nonsense. You deserve it.

30:55.561 --> 30:59.690
So, rumor has it
that you're not long for this office.

31:01.568 --> 31:05.363
You'd think in a building full of secrets,
we'd be better at keeping one.

31:05.530 --> 31:07.490
Ah. Then the rumors are true.

31:08.074 --> 31:10.118
The director is moving up
to a cabinet post.

31:10.201 --> 31:11.536
God help us all.

31:12.578 --> 31:15.623
The king is dead. Long live the queen.

31:16.332 --> 31:18.251
It's time they gave you the big seat,
Marion.

31:18.334 --> 31:19.460
They should have last time.

31:19.544 --> 31:22.588
That would have involved owing favors
in places I didn't want any debt.

31:24.215 --> 31:26.718
I want you as my deputy director, Bill.

31:27.135 --> 31:29.971
I need someone who can make things happen
and make hard decisions.

31:30.055 --> 31:33.641
Because unlike my predecessor,
I am not political

31:33.724 --> 31:35.643
and I am not concerned
what my next move is.

31:35.726 --> 31:38.104
I only want results and security.

31:38.188 --> 31:40.606
The integrity of what goes on here
is paramount.

31:40.690 --> 31:42.692
And I need people that understand that.

31:43.276 --> 31:47.197
Bringing in someone from covert operations
won't sit well with Defense or State.

31:47.280 --> 31:48.990
You just let me worry about that.

31:49.240 --> 31:51.576
Look, you've led
some of the most effective ops

31:51.659 --> 31:53.661
in recent history of this agency.

31:53.744 --> 31:55.997
But you're right.
To bring you in as deputy director

31:56.081 --> 31:57.332
will definitely get political.

31:57.415 --> 31:59.918
So I need to know, Bill,
between you and me...

32:00.293 --> 32:02.295
are there any skeletons buried out there

32:02.378 --> 32:04.797
that might come back
and bite us both in the ass?

32:05.465 --> 32:06.465
No, ma'am.

32:07.300 --> 32:08.426
Will you work with me?

32:10.511 --> 32:11.554
I'd be honored.

32:13.264 --> 32:15.141
Good. Here's to us.

32:18.686 --> 32:22.107
Once I head up, pull the van off the road.
You stay hidden.

32:25.651 --> 32:26.736
Frank.

32:28.571 --> 32:29.906
What can it hurt? Take it.

32:31.782 --> 32:34.119
I don't wanna hear from you
unless you hear from me.

32:35.745 --> 32:38.081
All right. You stay in the van.

32:39.457 --> 32:41.542
No getting your hands dirty this time.

34:11.757 --> 34:12.925
Gunner?

34:14.135 --> 34:15.136
You here?

34:21.101 --> 34:22.768
Gunner, it's Frank Castle!

34:26.356 --> 34:28.274
Brother, I just want to talk!

34:47.502 --> 34:49.420
Come on, Gunner, it's Frank!

35:02.100 --> 35:03.309
Gunner!

35:41.096 --> 35:42.473
God damn it.

35:47.478 --> 35:49.605
Gunner, God damn it, it's Frank Castle!

35:49.689 --> 35:52.483
Come on. I'm not a part of it, brother.
I never have been.

35:54.485 --> 35:56.404
Hey. Hey!

35:58.030 --> 36:01.826
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
I'm not your enemy, brother.

36:01.909 --> 36:04.204
It's me.

36:04.287 --> 36:07.748
That tape you made...
they thought it was me.

36:07.832 --> 36:09.083
They killed my family for it.

36:11.126 --> 36:13.254
Schoonover. He betrayed us.

36:14.339 --> 36:15.423
And I put him down.

36:18.801 --> 36:22.472
I just want a name, okay?
I want names and I'll let you be.

36:22.555 --> 36:23.598
God!

36:26.684 --> 36:28.478
Come on.

36:30.563 --> 36:31.647
Come on.

36:32.147 --> 36:34.108
Hey, it's me.

36:43.368 --> 36:44.369
I'm sorry I shot you.

36:45.077 --> 36:46.246
Well, shit.

36:47.038 --> 36:48.664
Yeah, brother, me, too.

36:49.164 --> 36:50.458
God!

36:53.753 --> 36:55.504
I'm sorry about your family.

36:58.716 --> 37:00.301
Agent Orange.

37:01.927 --> 37:04.555
You know who he is? You have a name?

37:05.681 --> 37:06.681
No.

37:08.058 --> 37:11.771
So, why'd you do it, man, why...
Why'd you make the tape?

37:13.940 --> 37:16.943
There was this kid on base...

37:18.403 --> 37:21.113
Young kid, 19, maybe.

37:22.907 --> 37:24.284
He lent me his knife...

37:26.201 --> 37:29.163
'cause I dropped mine somewhere.

37:31.624 --> 37:33.418
Knife's a sacred thing, Frank.

37:37.046 --> 37:40.300
Anyways, this... kid got killed and...

37:41.842 --> 37:46.597
I went down the mortuary to give him
his knife back, pay my respects.

37:48.808 --> 37:50.059
Then I saw him.

37:52.728 --> 37:54.314
They had that boy opened up.

37:55.731 --> 37:58.150
They was putting bags of drugs
into his body.

38:00.069 --> 38:01.321
Like he was nothing.

38:03.698 --> 38:07.242
Like, just an empty carcass.
Him and all the rest of them in there.

38:11.539 --> 38:12.873
Who was it, Gunner?

38:13.457 --> 38:14.834
Who was in the room?

38:16.168 --> 38:18.838
It was the colonel, Bennett...

38:20.756 --> 38:23.593
the one who run the mortuary.
Him and Orange.

38:25.636 --> 38:27.972
I didn't know who was in on it,
who I could trust.

38:31.601 --> 38:33.769
- They with you?
- Shit, no.

38:47.199 --> 38:49.034
Frank, you've got company.

38:53.706 --> 38:55.082
Let's go! Let's go!

39:11.641 --> 39:12.892
Hurry! Hurry!

40:13.494 --> 40:15.245
Shit!

41:44.502 --> 41:45.795
How bad?

41:45.878 --> 41:49.882
- I can fight. How many?
- Five, maybe six.

41:55.429 --> 41:59.141
Frank, I'm assuming you and your buddy
are the two hiding behind the tree, yeah?

42:00.309 --> 42:03.646
Closest two are behind you
at your five and seven.

42:13.488 --> 42:16.491
Now they're gonna come up
behind you from either side of the tree

42:16.576 --> 42:18.416
and then you got ten seconds
till the next pair

42:18.493 --> 42:21.038
comes at you from the front
making it a crossfire.

42:28.713 --> 42:30.380
Let's go. Let's go.

42:41.809 --> 42:44.645
Downhill. Move. Quickly.

43:05.833 --> 43:07.960
I guess we got a little help from above.

43:11.255 --> 43:13.465
Shit. Let's go.

43:56.091 --> 43:58.427
Come on! Come on!

43:58.510 --> 44:00.721
Come on! Come on!

44:02.806 --> 44:05.601
You're gonna die, you hear me?
I'm gonna kill you!

44:06.310 --> 44:07.853
You're gonna die!

44:20.574 --> 44:23.618
Whoever you are, I'm coming for you.

44:38.759 --> 44:40.511
Just like old times.

44:41.220 --> 44:42.596
Gunner.

44:44.098 --> 44:46.517
Come on. Come on.

44:49.687 --> 44:51.563
You gotta get out of here, man.

45:14.544 --> 45:16.255
How long are we gonna wait?

45:22.344 --> 45:23.470
Let's just eat.

45:56.086 --> 45:58.338
Come on. Come on.

45:58.422 --> 46:00.424
That's it. Come on.

46:24.031 --> 46:26.742
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, hell, man.

46:28.243 --> 46:30.621
I always figured
I'd die in these woods anyway.

46:34.333 --> 46:37.753
Shh. Come on. Hey.

46:38.838 --> 46:40.714
Yo.

46:42.216 --> 46:43.217
Hey.

46:44.093 --> 46:45.928
- Bury me, man.
- Stop that.

46:46.011 --> 46:48.347
Just bury me.
Promise me you'll bury me, okay?

46:54.144 --> 46:55.437
Okay.

46:56.480 --> 46:57.481
Okay.

46:59.066 --> 47:01.776
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

47:05.906 --> 47:08.367
Just stay here. I'll get help.

47:08.742 --> 47:09.910
Just stay here.

47:10.785 --> 47:13.956
I'll be back. I'll be back, Gunner.
You stay.

48:23.567 --> 48:26.111
So... drinking?

48:28.030 --> 48:29.323
Drinking.

48:32.159 --> 48:33.285
Tough day?

48:34.828 --> 48:36.330
Yeah. I had to make a decision

48:36.413 --> 48:38.832
and I have no idea
if I made the right one.

48:38.916 --> 48:41.036
Sometimes I think the only way
to get by in this world

48:41.085 --> 48:43.920
is to step off it for a while, you know?

48:44.964 --> 48:47.382
And if it helps, I also had a shitty day.

48:50.719 --> 48:53.097
So, what are we gonna do about that?

48:56.391 --> 48:58.060
I'm open to suggestions.

48:58.769 --> 48:59.853
You are?

49:02.356 --> 49:05.317
I mean, within reason.

49:06.401 --> 49:07.777
Why? What you got in mind?

49:14.243 --> 49:16.161
Hey, you all right? You all right?

49:16.245 --> 49:17.537
I'm fine.

49:35.639 --> 49:38.267
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What happened?

49:38.350 --> 49:40.477
- Hey, don't stop.
- What happened to you?

49:40.560 --> 49:41.936
Shh.

50:50.672 --> 50:52.091
Oh, shit!

52:15.965 --> 52:17.176
Come on now, Frank.

52:18.176 --> 52:20.470
Everything's gonna be okay, all right?

52:21.096 --> 52:22.639
Everything's gonna be okay.

52:47.331 --> 52:49.458
Might be hope for you yet, Spook.

52:53.878 --> 52:55.880
Okay, okay.

52:57.090 --> 52:58.300
Okay.
