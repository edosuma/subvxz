00:06.320 --> 00:09.156
This, boys and girls, is a story of true love.

00:09.239 --> 00:12.950
A beautiful girl from one county,
a handsome boy from another.

00:13.076 --> 00:14.911
They meet, and they fall in love.

00:14.994 --> 00:18.997
Separated by distance and by parents
who did not approve of the union...

00:19.082 --> 00:22.585
the young couple dreamed of the day
that they could be together.

00:22.668 --> 00:26.922
They wrote each other beautiful letters,
letters of longing and passion...

00:27.006 --> 00:30.133
letters full of promises
and plans for the future.

00:30.426 --> 00:34.554
Soon the separation proved too much
for either one of them to bear.

00:34.721 --> 00:37.974
So, one night, cold and black...

00:38.141 --> 00:42.603
with no light to guide them,
they both snuck out of their homes...

00:42.771 --> 00:45.231
and ran away as fast as they could.

00:45.273 --> 00:48.984
It was so dark out
that they were both soon lost.

00:49.277 --> 00:52.321
And it seemed as if
they would never find each other.

00:52.488 --> 00:57.325
Finally, the girl dropped to her knees,
tears streaming down her lovely face.

00:57.535 --> 01:01.747
'Oh, my love, where are you?
How will I find you?'

01:02.122 --> 01:05.917
Suddenly, a band of stars
appeared in the sky.

01:06.084 --> 01:10.296
These stars shone so brightly,
they lit up the entire countryside.

01:10.505 --> 01:11.756
The girl jumped to her feet...

01:11.798 --> 01:14.759
and followed the path of the stars,
until finally...

01:14.801 --> 01:18.804
she found herself standing
right where the town gazebo is today.

01:19.013 --> 01:21.932
And there waiting for her,
was her one true love...

01:21.974 --> 01:25.227
who had also been led here
by the blanket of friendly stars.

01:26.979 --> 01:30.357
And that, my friends, is the story
of how Stars Hollow came to be...

01:30.441 --> 01:33.527
and why we celebrate that fateful night...

01:33.610 --> 01:35.778
every year at about this time.

01:36.280 --> 01:39.783
Now, we still have a little time left
in our story hour.

01:40.492 --> 01:43.870
Who wants to hear about the time
I danced in a cage for Tito Puente?

01:44.037 --> 01:45.329
Me.

01:45.580 --> 01:47.957
It was the summer of '66.

02:55.438 --> 02:56.522
So?

02:56.605 --> 02:58.314
- It's depressing.
- It's beautiful.

02:58.399 --> 03:01.818
- She throws herself under a train.
- But I bet she looked great doing it.

03:01.902 --> 03:04.612
I don't know, I think maybe
Tolstoy's a little over my head.

03:04.696 --> 03:08.199
No, that's not true. Tolstoy wrote
for the masses, the common man.

03:08.283 --> 03:11.160
It's untrue that you have to be a genius
to read his stuff.

03:11.244 --> 03:12.203
Yeah, but...

03:12.287 --> 03:13.663
- I know it's big.
- Very big.

03:13.747 --> 03:15.373
- And long.
- Very long.

03:15.415 --> 03:18.876
Many Russian names tend to be spelled
very similarly, so it's confusing.

03:18.960 --> 03:22.379
Every single person's name ends
with 'sky. ' Now how's that possible?

03:22.422 --> 03:26.008
It's one of my favorite books.
I know if you just give it a try...

03:26.759 --> 03:27.843
I'll try again.

03:27.927 --> 03:29.094
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:29.178 --> 03:30.387
You won't be sorry.

03:30.429 --> 03:32.180
- Coffee?
- Please.

03:35.225 --> 03:37.393
I thought Christmas was a big deal
around here.

03:37.477 --> 03:39.729
This is a town that likes the celebrating.

03:39.771 --> 03:43.566
Last year, we had a month-long carnival
when we got off the septic tank system.

03:43.650 --> 03:46.152
- A month long? You're kidding.
- No.

03:46.236 --> 03:50.740
There were rides, a petting zoo,
balloon animals, and a freak show.

03:52.241 --> 03:54.534
Okay, you almost had me going there
for a second.

03:54.619 --> 03:56.912
We did have a ribbon-cutting ceremony.

03:58.789 --> 04:00.957
What are you doing Friday night?

04:01.125 --> 04:03.752
I've got the usual
Friday night grandparents' dinner.

04:03.794 --> 04:05.962
But I thought
if we get back early enough...

04:06.046 --> 04:08.298
we should go watch the bonfire together.

04:08.382 --> 04:11.218
I mean, it's kind of corny,
but it's really pretty.

04:11.593 --> 04:13.761
And they sell star-shaped hot dogs.

04:13.803 --> 04:17.389
How about if you get out of dinner
at your grandparents' this week?

04:17.599 --> 04:20.184
- I don't think so.
- What if it's for a special occasion?

04:20.267 --> 04:23.813
The occasion better include
my being relocated to a plastic bubble...

04:23.896 --> 04:25.939
if my grandmother's gonna
let me out of dinner.

04:26.023 --> 04:28.066
There must be another excuse
that you can use.

04:28.150 --> 04:29.192
Like what?

04:29.276 --> 04:32.529
Like it's your three-month anniversary
with your boyfriend.

04:32.655 --> 04:34.740
- It is?
- Yeah.

04:34.948 --> 04:36.282
Three months from your birthday.

04:36.366 --> 04:37.992
That's when I gave you the bracelet...

04:38.076 --> 04:40.703
and that's when I figure
this whole thing started.

04:40.787 --> 04:41.871
Three months!

04:41.955 --> 04:43.831
Actually, your birthday
was on a Saturday...

04:43.915 --> 04:45.958
so it should be Saturday,
but I work Saturday...

04:46.042 --> 04:49.336
and I planned this whole big thing.
So I thought we could do it Friday.

04:49.420 --> 04:52.923
- What whole big thing?
- Just this once, miss dinner. Please.

04:53.424 --> 04:55.884
Don't make me throw myself under a train.

04:56.677 --> 04:58.220
I'll see what I can do.

04:58.304 --> 05:00.180
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

05:03.142 --> 05:05.936
- It's our three-month anniversary.
- Yeah, it is.

05:06.061 --> 05:09.439
- I feel stupid I didn't even know about this.
- That's quite all right.

05:09.523 --> 05:12.484
I feel really bad
that I missed our two-month anniversary.

05:12.567 --> 05:14.610
- Quite all right, too.
- How was it?

05:14.694 --> 05:16.529
- Pretty good.
- I'm glad.

05:30.376 --> 05:33.003
- No. Put that away.
- I want to cook.

05:33.045 --> 05:34.254
- You can make soup.
- No.

05:34.338 --> 05:36.506
I want to really cook
like on the Food Channel.

05:36.548 --> 05:39.092
I want to saute things, chop things,
do the 'bam!'

05:39.176 --> 05:42.887
I want to arrange things on plates.
I want to be the iron chef.

05:42.971 --> 05:44.180
- Fine.
- Really?

05:44.389 --> 05:45.973
- Yeah, I'll help.
- Okay.

05:46.057 --> 05:49.018
- I need a pan.
- And a fire extinguisher.

05:49.519 --> 05:50.728
Funny girl.

05:51.437 --> 05:54.815
Now, if I'd only bought some hamburger.

05:54.899 --> 05:57.818
- You didn't buy hamburger?
- Yes, I bought hamburger.

05:57.902 --> 06:01.321
I just like saying things like that
so you look at me like I'm crazy.

06:02.281 --> 06:04.825
So tell me,
why the sudden need to be domestic?

06:04.908 --> 06:07.535
- I don't know. I'm in a funky mood.
- Why?

06:07.619 --> 06:09.996
Too many stars, too much love.
It makes me cranky.

06:10.080 --> 06:13.291
- So you haven't heard from Mr. Medina.
- No, I haven't.

06:13.375 --> 06:16.085
- Maybe that's why you are cranky.
- New subject, please.

06:16.169 --> 06:18.754
- You have a phone also.
- How's it coming with that pan?

06:18.838 --> 06:20.339
Cleopatra, queen of denial.

06:20.423 --> 06:22.383
- The pan. Please.
- Okay, fine.

06:22.467 --> 06:24.010
- New topic.
- Thank you.

06:24.093 --> 06:26.386
I have this huge favor to ask you.

06:27.346 --> 06:29.723
Something I can hold over your head.
Let's hear it.

06:29.765 --> 06:32.475
Friday night is Dean's and my
three-month anniversary.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.894
Three months? Wow!

06:33.978 --> 06:36.814
Dean apparently has some
big, fancy evening planned for us.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.857
- Very classy of him.
- Yes, it is.

06:38.941 --> 06:42.402
But for me to actually partake
of the aforesaid fancy evening...

06:42.486 --> 06:44.904
I have to get out of Friday night dinner.

06:44.988 --> 06:46.614
- Good luck with that.
- Mom.

06:46.698 --> 06:49.075
Do you know how much
Emily Gilmore will not care...

06:49.159 --> 06:50.702
about your anniversary?

06:50.785 --> 06:52.244
You could talk to her.

06:52.328 --> 06:55.747
If there was a runoff between what
Emily Gilmore would care about less:

06:55.832 --> 06:58.584
A two-for-one toilet paper sale
or your anniversary...

06:58.626 --> 07:00.669
your anniversary would win. Hands down.

07:00.753 --> 07:04.006
- You won't even try to help?
- I'm gonna try because I care.

07:04.089 --> 07:06.466
- Emily Gilmore, however...
- Phone, please.

07:07.176 --> 07:08.385
Okay.

07:10.888 --> 07:11.888
What?

07:13.140 --> 07:14.724
Nothing. It's just...

07:15.433 --> 07:19.770
'Mom, Rory and Dean are having their
three-month anniversary on Friday. '

07:19.854 --> 07:22.898
'Really, Lorelai?
Why, that's wonderful. I'm thrilled. '

07:22.982 --> 07:23.982
Stop.

07:24.067 --> 07:26.819
'Three months.
Hold on. I'm going to cartwheel. '

07:26.903 --> 07:29.905
- Forget it.
- No way. She's telling my dad now.

07:30.156 --> 07:33.242
- I think they're cabbage patching.
- That's it. Find your own pan.

07:33.325 --> 07:34.784
- Hello?
- Mom?

07:34.869 --> 07:37.079
- Lorelai?
- Yes.

07:38.831 --> 07:40.165
Hi. How are you doing?

07:40.249 --> 07:42.292
- I'm doing fine.
- That's good.

07:42.542 --> 07:44.418
- I'm pleased.
- And how's Dad?

07:44.503 --> 07:45.629
What do you want, Lorelai?

07:46.630 --> 07:48.757
I was just calling to say hello.

07:48.840 --> 07:50.967
- And now you have.
- Okay, good.

07:51.050 --> 07:53.594
Was there anything else
you wanted to add to that hello?

07:53.636 --> 07:55.220
As a matter of fact, there is.

07:57.807 --> 08:00.267
- You know Rory?
- Yes, I believe I do.

08:00.351 --> 08:02.227
She wanted to say hello, too.

08:03.020 --> 08:05.105
I'm late for a meeting.
I'd love to know why.

08:05.773 --> 08:09.067
Mom, just hear me out, okay?
And don't say anything.

08:09.443 --> 08:12.112
Friday night is Rory and Dean's
three-month anniversary.

08:12.195 --> 08:14.947
While that might not seem
a big deal to you, it is to them.

08:15.073 --> 08:17.909
I'm gonna ask you to do something
you are not gonna wanna do.

08:17.993 --> 08:21.037
I'm begging you to look at it
from her point of view and maybe...

08:21.538 --> 08:24.916
let her, just this once,
not come to dinner on Friday.

08:26.876 --> 08:27.876
All right.

08:28.878 --> 08:29.878
What?

08:29.962 --> 08:33.965
Since this is a special occasion, it would
be fine if Rory missed dinner on Friday.

08:34.049 --> 08:35.341
- It would?
- Yes.

08:35.426 --> 08:37.344
- Are you sure?
- I believe I am.

08:37.385 --> 08:38.678
- No arguments?
- No.

08:38.761 --> 08:40.597
- She won't be there.
- I understand.

08:40.681 --> 08:41.932
- At all.
- I heard.

08:42.015 --> 08:44.015
- All night long.
- I assumed as much.

08:44.101 --> 08:45.227
- Okay.
- Okay.

08:45.310 --> 08:46.769
- All right.
- Anything else?

08:48.021 --> 08:51.107
She's gonna need some help
getting ready for the big night.

08:51.191 --> 08:53.192
- So I should...
- We'll see you at 7:00.

08:53.276 --> 08:55.486
Okay. Right. Bye.

08:56.654 --> 08:57.654
So?

08:57.739 --> 08:59.699
The world is officially coming to an end.

09:01.409 --> 09:03.911
- And they're off.
- The bell just rang three seconds ago.

09:03.994 --> 09:05.537
How did they get lip-locked so fast?

09:05.621 --> 09:07.164
I want a boyfriend to make out with.

09:07.248 --> 09:08.499
Ty Tallson likes you.

09:08.582 --> 09:10.542
I want a different boyfriend
to make out with.

09:10.626 --> 09:13.503
- I can't get to my locker.
- They'll move if you ask nice.

09:13.587 --> 09:16.464
You know, dangle a hotel key
in front of their faces.

09:16.882 --> 09:19.217
This is a school.
You don't do this in a school.

09:19.259 --> 09:22.095
Not unless you've got
a boyfriend like Tristan.

09:22.178 --> 09:23.971
Then you do it anywhere you can.

09:24.055 --> 09:25.639
- Street corner.
- Shopping mall.

09:25.723 --> 09:27.099
- Phone booth.
- Starbucks.

09:27.183 --> 09:30.728
Thank you for the where-to-make-out list.
I just need to get my books.

09:30.811 --> 09:32.395
Hell hath no fury.

09:34.899 --> 09:37.067
Excuse me. You're in my way.

09:38.319 --> 09:41.238
Spawn in front of
somebody else's locker, please.

09:41.280 --> 09:43.782
I'm assuming your locker's in there
somewhere also.

09:43.865 --> 09:45.741
Right behind Belle Watling.

09:45.784 --> 09:48.161
- Have you tried to get their attention?
- Sure have.

09:48.245 --> 09:49.704
- No luck?
- No.

09:51.581 --> 09:53.958
God, look at that.
It's like he's eating her face.

09:54.042 --> 09:56.294
Okay, that's it. I'm getting the fire hose.

09:56.377 --> 09:58.003
Let me try first.

09:59.213 --> 10:02.257
Could you move this whole thing
down to the left a little?

10:02.341 --> 10:04.509
- What?
- You're standing in front of the lockers.

10:04.593 --> 10:06.720
- Our lockers.
- Sorry.

10:06.929 --> 10:09.306
- Just got a little carried away.
- Right.

10:11.809 --> 10:13.810
- Hey, Paris.
- Hey.

10:15.270 --> 10:16.771
You should get bangs.

10:16.897 --> 10:18.148
Thanks for the tip.

10:18.231 --> 10:21.400
You have a long forehead.
Bangs would hide that.

10:24.237 --> 10:25.696
Party at my house Saturday.

10:25.780 --> 10:27.198
Dress to impress, please.

10:27.281 --> 10:29.157
- Come?
- I don't know.

10:29.242 --> 10:31.410
- You could bring your boyfriend.
- I'll see.

10:31.494 --> 10:35.122
- Meet me after Biology?
- And if I don't?

10:35.206 --> 10:36.457
You will.

10:38.375 --> 10:39.793
Yes, I will.

10:41.003 --> 10:42.462
To be young and in love.

10:42.504 --> 10:45.548
What a shame Elizabeth Barrett Browning
wasn't here to see this.

10:45.632 --> 10:47.717
She'd put her head through a wall.

11:07.820 --> 11:12.157
Now, people, this is a kitchen.
At least wear some hairnets.

11:13.325 --> 11:16.953
- Hello. We were...
- Just discussing jam making.

11:16.995 --> 11:20.665
Jackson's gonna start
making jam and preserves.

11:20.749 --> 11:22.083
Maybe tomato sauce.

11:22.167 --> 11:25.378
There's a whole world out there
beyond growing vegetables.

11:25.461 --> 11:26.962
- No coffee?
- Sorry.

11:27.255 --> 11:28.506
That's okay.

11:28.881 --> 11:31.133
- Resume smooching.
- Thank you.

11:35.554 --> 11:38.681
No, cherie. I can't wait either.

11:39.475 --> 11:40.809
Very soon.

11:42.561 --> 11:43.853
You are?

11:45.564 --> 11:47.524
Don't tease me.

11:47.858 --> 11:50.819
I promise all this waiting
will be worthwhile.

11:51.194 --> 11:52.903
I'll see you then.

11:54.656 --> 11:56.616
Goodbye, darling.

11:59.035 --> 12:00.578
So how's Mom?

12:01.454 --> 12:05.040
And while normally I would look forward
to a good verbal sparring match...

12:05.124 --> 12:06.500
today I say no.

12:06.584 --> 12:11.046
My heart is light, the world is fine,
and I have a date for Saturday night.

12:11.130 --> 12:12.172
Your turn.

12:14.091 --> 12:17.052
What I need now is lots and lots of coffee.

12:25.935 --> 12:27.227
Heads up!

12:28.438 --> 12:30.731
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

12:31.190 --> 12:32.190
Man!

12:32.775 --> 12:35.694
- That has never happened before.
- Really?

12:36.695 --> 12:38.196
How about that.

12:47.581 --> 12:50.417
I was almost crushed
by a papier-mache star.

12:50.500 --> 12:53.044
- How's your day?
- It's looking pretty good now.

12:53.086 --> 12:55.254
Coffee, please, and a shot of cynicism.

12:55.338 --> 12:58.257
- Why so cheery?
- I don't know. I'm just in a mood.

12:58.341 --> 13:00.593
There's no particular reason
for this mood?

13:00.635 --> 13:03.554
- No. You don't believe me?
- I believe you.

13:03.679 --> 13:07.098
You say there's no reason for the mood,
there's no reason for the mood.

13:07.141 --> 13:10.018
- Simply nuts.
- Or bipolar. That's very big nowadays.

13:10.102 --> 13:12.395
No, Patty, you're wrong.

13:12.479 --> 13:14.856
They built the fire
to throw themselves on it...

13:14.940 --> 13:16.232
when their families found them.

13:16.275 --> 13:18.360
Taylor, you're crazy. They built the fire...

13:18.443 --> 13:20.778
so they could stay warm
their first night here.

13:20.862 --> 13:24.240
Patty, I am the recording secretary
for the Stars Hollow City Council.

13:24.282 --> 13:26.700
I think I know how my town was founded.

13:26.785 --> 13:30.121
Can nobody talk about anything else
but this stupid festival?

13:31.706 --> 13:34.667
That came out a lot louder
than it was supposed to, didn't it?

13:34.750 --> 13:38.628
This festival is commemorating
the founding of our town, young lady.

13:38.712 --> 13:41.005
- I know, Taylor. I'm sorry.
- She's bipolar.

13:41.090 --> 13:44.259
Really? But you're so young.

13:44.510 --> 13:47.971
- Can I get you two anything else?
- No, thank you, sweetheart.

13:48.722 --> 13:51.474
I don't know what's wrong with me.
This is a beautiful festival.

13:51.516 --> 13:52.767
People should be enjoying it.

13:52.851 --> 13:56.479
It's a crazy festival based on a nutty myth
about two lunatics...

13:56.563 --> 13:58.940
who in all probability did not even exist.

13:58.982 --> 14:03.236
Even if they did, they probably
dropped dead of diphtheria before age 24.

14:03.319 --> 14:05.821
The town of Stars Hollow
probably got its name...

14:05.905 --> 14:09.450
from the local dance hall prostitute.
Two rich drunk guys...

14:09.533 --> 14:12.160
who made up the story
to make it look good on a poster.

14:12.244 --> 14:14.871
You're full of hate and loathing,
and I love it.

14:14.955 --> 14:17.332
It's good to have someone
to share this hate with.

14:17.374 --> 14:18.416
My pleasure.

14:18.500 --> 14:19.834
- More coffee?
- Please.

14:19.876 --> 14:21.836
Tomorrow, if you have time...

14:21.878 --> 14:24.964
I'm planning on despising everyone
who says, 'Hey, how's it going?'

14:25.048 --> 14:26.424
You're on.

14:27.634 --> 14:30.553
- Hey, how's it going?
- No, that's just too easy.

14:32.555 --> 14:33.639
Rachel.

14:34.599 --> 14:36.017
Your Rachel?

14:37.518 --> 14:40.020
- You're Rachel?
- I'm Rachel.

14:46.985 --> 14:48.069
What are you...

14:48.153 --> 14:51.948
I mean, I thought you were
in the Congo or Philadelphia or something.

14:52.032 --> 14:55.451
Actually, though very similar
to both the Congo and Philadelphia...

14:55.535 --> 14:57.370
I was in the Mideast.

14:57.912 --> 15:00.164
Guess that postcard
must have gotten lost.

15:00.206 --> 15:03.834
Yeah, things are pretty crazy over there.
Not a lot of writing time.

15:03.918 --> 15:06.962
But I finished up my assignment,
I flew back to Chicago...

15:07.046 --> 15:09.298
and I was walking through O'Hare,
and I look up...

15:09.381 --> 15:12.842
and there's a plane leaving
for Hartford in, like, 20 minutes.

15:13.218 --> 15:15.803
- All of a sudden, I'm on it.
- Nice story.

15:16.263 --> 15:19.974
- I should have called.
- No, you... It's fine.

15:20.350 --> 15:22.226
- You look good.
- Thanks.

15:24.104 --> 15:25.522
You look...

15:28.983 --> 15:31.902
- He thinks you look good, too. Right?
- Right.

15:32.028 --> 15:33.737
- And you do.
- Thank you.

15:34.572 --> 15:37.991
- I'm Lorelai.
- Yeah, she's Lorelai.

15:38.075 --> 15:39.409
I'm Luke's friend.

15:39.452 --> 15:42.663
Yeah, she works at the Independence Inn.

15:42.746 --> 15:44.038
I run it, actually.

15:44.081 --> 15:46.708
Sorry, she runs it.

15:47.417 --> 15:51.003
I love that place.
That must be a pretty big job.

15:51.088 --> 15:53.757
It is. It's crazy.
There's always something happening.

15:53.840 --> 15:57.176
We put these coffeemakers in the rooms
and only half of them work.

15:57.260 --> 16:00.179
They just shake and gurgle
like they're having a fit.

16:00.597 --> 16:02.390
Why were you in the Mideast?

16:02.432 --> 16:04.267
I was doing a photo story...

16:04.350 --> 16:08.395
on how Palestinian and Israeli families
have been affected by the violence.

16:08.479 --> 16:11.356
Well, so you understand
about the job pressure.

16:12.024 --> 16:13.275
I'm gonna go.

16:13.359 --> 16:16.361
- Please don't let me drive you away.
- That's okay, you're not.

16:16.445 --> 16:19.281
I have to go sit in a closet or something.

16:19.364 --> 16:22.325
- So, it was really nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you, too.

16:22.409 --> 16:23.701
Okay. Bye.

16:33.294 --> 16:36.547
'We got new coffeemakers. '
What was I thinking?

16:36.631 --> 16:39.633
You spent a lot of time picking out
those coffeemakers.

16:39.717 --> 16:41.593
Yeah, I'm Mrs. Coffee.

16:41.760 --> 16:46.014
- Okay, I'm still attached to the head.
- Sorry, I'm a little worked up.

16:46.348 --> 16:48.808
- Mom, it's just Luke's ex-girlfriend.
- I know.

16:48.851 --> 16:51.937
I just hate that I made myself
look so stupid in front of...

16:52.020 --> 16:53.896
- Luke?
- No, Rachel.

16:53.980 --> 16:55.815
She was standing there, fresh off a plane.

16:55.857 --> 16:57.733
She had no plane hair at all, might I add.

16:57.817 --> 17:00.944
- What exactly is plane hair?
- You know. It's all big and all...

17:01.029 --> 17:01.988
Got it.

17:02.071 --> 17:04.071
He's looking at her
like she's Miss September.

17:04.156 --> 17:06.075
She's looking at him
like he's Johnny Depp...

17:06.159 --> 17:09.537
and I was just babbling like a moron.
What is wrong with me?

17:09.619 --> 17:11.997
Okay, you are now officially off hair duty.

17:12.039 --> 17:14.249
- I'm sorry. I just...
- No, it's okay.

17:14.333 --> 17:16.917
It's a little early
for Dean to see me completely bald.

17:17.002 --> 17:19.212
Right. That's more a six-month thing.

17:19.296 --> 17:21.172
- What's going on with you?
- I don't know.

17:21.256 --> 17:24.300
It's just all this love in the air, you know.

17:25.510 --> 17:26.886
I miss Max.

17:27.470 --> 17:30.347
There's been so much going on
with your dad coming home...

17:30.390 --> 17:32.683
and family stuff
and your constant existence.

17:32.767 --> 17:34.518
- Thanks for the love.
- Any time.

17:34.602 --> 17:37.688
I haven't had a lot of time to focus on it,
and I miss Max.

17:37.772 --> 17:38.814
I know.

17:38.856 --> 17:41.942
- I had a dream about him the other night.
- Really? Dirty?

17:42.026 --> 17:45.070
Absolutely not. When you're 21,
I'll tell you the real answer.

17:45.154 --> 17:47.114
Anyway, it's put me in a funk since then.

17:47.197 --> 17:48.823
- I'm sorry.
- Me, too.

17:48.866 --> 17:51.702
We could talk about me for years,
and believe me, we will.

17:51.743 --> 17:54.203
But let's focus on you,
the lady of the evening.

17:54.287 --> 17:56.872
- No hooker reference intended.
- Glad to hear it.

17:56.957 --> 17:59.834
- What are you gonna wear with that?
- You tell me.

17:59.876 --> 18:02.378
- Where is he taking you?
- Why?

18:02.503 --> 18:05.339
You don't want to clash with the decor.
A lady plans ahead.

18:05.381 --> 18:08.383
If you must know,
he's taking me to Andeloro's.

18:08.467 --> 18:11.261
- Isn't that romantic.
- I know.

18:11.345 --> 18:13.722
It's gonna be just like Lady and the Tramp.

18:13.764 --> 18:16.725
You'll share spaghetti,
but it'll just be one long strand.

18:16.767 --> 18:19.269
You won't realize it
until you meet in the middle.

18:19.353 --> 18:21.938
Then, he'll push a meatball
towards you with his nose...

18:22.022 --> 18:23.857
and you'll push it back with your nose.

18:23.899 --> 18:26.901
Then, you'll bring the meatball home
and save it for years.

18:26.985 --> 18:29.487
- Mom?
- Neither. Just wear your coat.

18:30.030 --> 18:32.740
But your flower's just a little smushed.

18:33.658 --> 18:34.742
Rory?

18:34.867 --> 18:36.159
There you go. You're all set.

18:36.244 --> 18:37.745
Is anyone here?

18:37.829 --> 18:40.706
- You all right?
- Yeah. You look beautiful. Go.

18:44.335 --> 18:45.335
Lane?

18:46.003 --> 18:47.129
My God!

18:48.172 --> 18:49.840
- I just can't believe it!
- I know.

18:49.923 --> 18:52.967
Three months!
That's like one sixty-fourth of your life!

18:53.051 --> 18:56.846
I have to stop hanging out with you.
You're making my life seem too pathetic.

18:56.930 --> 18:58.389
Join the club.

18:58.431 --> 19:01.433
Are you going to the festival?
We could meet you there later.

19:01.518 --> 19:03.144
That would be romantic.

19:03.895 --> 19:07.064
I'm going to the festival,
and would you like to know why?

19:07.148 --> 19:09.608
- My mother has set me up again.
- Another future doctor?

19:09.692 --> 19:12.611
A future chiropractor.
She's losing confidence in my prospects.

19:12.695 --> 19:14.530
- Maybe he'll be nice.
- It's not just him.

19:14.613 --> 19:16.781
We're going with his parents,
his grandparents...

19:16.865 --> 19:20.118
two sisters, three brothers,
and at least one maiden aunt.

19:20.786 --> 19:21.828
That's Dean.

19:21.912 --> 19:23.997
Remember,
you have to tell me everything.

19:24.081 --> 19:25.165
Okay, you, too.

19:25.248 --> 19:28.501
Yeah, after the walking, the silence,
the sitting, and the bye-bye...

19:28.585 --> 19:29.961
then the fun will begin.

19:30.045 --> 19:31.629
I want to know, anyhow.

19:31.713 --> 19:33.714
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, honey. Have fun.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.843
Don't forget the meatball.

19:37.927 --> 19:40.679
- The meatball?
- It's a mother-daughter thing.

19:43.057 --> 19:45.809
So, think I could hang out with you
for a while?

19:46.143 --> 19:49.938
Not unless you want to go to Hartford.
Besides, didn't anyone ever tell you...

19:49.980 --> 19:53.441
it's not polite to keep
15 prospective Korean in-laws waiting.

19:53.525 --> 19:57.361
You could run over me. Maybe my mother
wouldn't make me go if I was in hospital.

19:57.445 --> 19:59.446
- I wouldn't count on it.
- You're right.

20:19.425 --> 20:20.467
You're late.

20:20.509 --> 20:22.344
- How did you do that?
- What?

20:22.427 --> 20:24.345
Answer the door
before I even rang the bell?

20:24.429 --> 20:27.431
I thought I heard something.
I came to the door. You were there.

20:27.516 --> 20:29.100
Come in, please.

20:32.312 --> 20:34.772
- You thought you heard something?
- Yes.

20:34.856 --> 20:37.316
- Mom, that door is, like, 10 feet thick.
- So?

20:37.358 --> 20:40.360
It wasn't like I was standing out there
with a band of jackals.

20:40.403 --> 20:41.737
I was just drinking coffee.

20:41.821 --> 20:43.822
Lorelai, what is it that you want to hear?

20:43.906 --> 20:47.033
That I was standing by the window,
staring out at the driveway...

20:47.117 --> 20:48.868
waiting to pounce
the moment you arrived?

20:48.952 --> 20:52.455
Yes, because believe it or not,
that would be less creepy.

20:52.539 --> 20:54.707
Get yourself a drink, please.

20:56.168 --> 20:57.335
Hey, Dad.

20:57.377 --> 20:59.545
- Lorelai.
- Sorry I'm late.

20:59.629 --> 21:01.756
I was helping Rory get ready
for her big date...

21:01.840 --> 21:03.841
and, well, you know girls.

21:07.512 --> 21:09.680
- How's work?
- Work is fine.

21:09.722 --> 21:11.974
Yeah? Good.

21:13.100 --> 21:14.893
My work's fine, too.

21:15.436 --> 21:16.645
Oh, God.

21:17.813 --> 21:20.231
Mom has gone a little crazy
with the figurines here.

21:20.274 --> 21:21.358
A little Kathy Bates?

21:21.442 --> 21:24.236
You probably haven't seen Misery,
which is a good thing.

21:24.319 --> 21:27.572
'Cause Rory couldn't sleep alone
for a week after we watched it.

21:27.614 --> 21:30.324
That wouldn't be a problem for you.
You don't sleep alone.

21:30.408 --> 21:34.745
I'm guessing. I don't know what
your and Mom's sleeping arrangement is.

21:34.787 --> 21:36.622
Now I'm wishing I hadn't brought it up...

21:36.706 --> 21:39.583
because it's a don't-want-to-go-there
subject for me.

21:39.667 --> 21:42.544
Not for you, because you should
definitely go there if you...

21:42.587 --> 21:43.963
Well, anyway...

21:44.046 --> 21:45.338
What have you done now?

21:45.423 --> 21:48.092
I'm putting the bunny back
with his little friends...

21:48.133 --> 21:50.593
and I just sort of massacred them
a little bit.

21:50.678 --> 21:54.014
- But, that's life in the jungle, isn't it?
- Just sit down, please.

21:54.097 --> 21:55.389
Okay. Sorry.

21:55.432 --> 21:58.351
- Just sit with your hands in your lap.
- Sorry.

21:58.435 --> 21:59.978
And I'm trying to read.

22:00.061 --> 22:03.689
So please, just be quiet,
and try not to break anything else.

22:03.773 --> 22:05.524
We having a nice chat?

22:05.608 --> 22:08.068
We're having a great conversation,
me and Morrie.

22:08.111 --> 22:09.862
- Excuse me?
- Nothing.

22:09.946 --> 22:13.115
Thanks for letting Rory out of dinner.
She really appreciated it.

22:13.157 --> 22:15.200
She deserves to celebrate.

22:15.284 --> 22:18.829
A three-month anniversary
is a landmark feat at her age.

22:18.954 --> 22:21.289
Or at any age, for some people.

22:21.707 --> 22:24.626
I was gonna get a drink.
I'm gonna get right on that.

22:27.045 --> 22:28.546
I'll get that.

22:30.423 --> 22:32.800
- Can I freshen up your drink, Dad?
- No, thank you.

22:32.884 --> 22:34.844
One drink before dinner is quite enough.

22:34.928 --> 22:36.179
Right. Sorry.

22:36.304 --> 22:39.640
- I had no idea it was so close.
- Absolutely. Right around the corner.

22:39.682 --> 22:41.266
What a small world.

22:41.350 --> 22:44.186
Lorelai, I'd like you
to meet Chase Bradford.

22:44.645 --> 22:48.273
He was telling me that he grew up
right around the corner from here.

22:48.315 --> 22:50.275
- Really?
- Stone house on the corner.

22:50.317 --> 22:53.653
- The one with the Dobermans.
- That's right. Leopold and Loeb.

22:53.695 --> 22:55.780
I'm afraid they passed on a few years ago.

22:55.822 --> 22:57.865
Postmen finally got organized?

22:59.117 --> 23:01.619
Chase, this is my husband, Richard.

23:02.495 --> 23:05.039
- How do you do?
- Fine, Richard. Just fine.

23:05.123 --> 23:06.749
Please, sit down.

23:07.667 --> 23:10.002
I didn't know we were having company
for dinner.

23:10.044 --> 23:12.963
It was just a spur-of-the-moment thing.

23:13.089 --> 23:15.424
Chase's mother and I
are in the DAR together...

23:15.508 --> 23:18.510
and he's moved back to Hartford.
It seemed like a nice idea.

23:18.594 --> 23:20.137
Yes, very nice.

23:20.471 --> 23:22.055
Can I get you a drink?

23:22.139 --> 23:23.348
A Scotch, neat.

23:23.390 --> 23:25.099
- Glenfiddich?
- Fine.

23:25.184 --> 23:27.686
Your mother's told me all about you.

23:27.811 --> 23:28.978
- Really?
- Yes.

23:29.020 --> 23:32.898
I'm just sorry your daughter couldn't
join us for dinner. I adore children.

23:34.192 --> 23:36.027
Mom, could I talk to you for a minute?

23:36.111 --> 23:38.655
- We have company.
- It'll just take a second, really.

23:38.738 --> 23:40.698
- But...
- Come on, it'll be fun.

23:40.740 --> 23:43.742
Excuse us. We're gonna have
a spur-of-the-moment conversation.

23:46.579 --> 23:47.705
You're pushing me.

23:47.788 --> 23:49.164
- Is this a setup?
- What?

23:49.206 --> 23:52.459
Connecticut Ken in there.
Is he my invited escort for the evening?

23:52.543 --> 23:54.670
- His mother is a friend of mine.
- And?

23:54.753 --> 23:56.838
He just moved back here.
He doesn't know anyone.

23:56.922 --> 23:58.006
And?

23:58.048 --> 24:00.675
And I thought he might enjoy meeting you.

24:00.717 --> 24:02.051
Put that finger down.

24:02.093 --> 24:05.721
This is why the Miss Congeniality act
when Rory wanted to beg out of dinner.

24:05.805 --> 24:07.640
It seemed like a good opportunity.

24:07.724 --> 24:10.685
Mom, thank you for the thought,
but I can get my own men.

24:11.352 --> 24:13.228
- Really?
- Yes, really.

24:13.271 --> 24:15.356
- I must disagree.
- You must?

24:15.439 --> 24:17.983
Chase is a quality man.
He has good breeding.

24:18.067 --> 24:20.903
He comes from a nice family.
He makes a nice living.

24:20.945 --> 24:22.946
- He's attractive.
- Mom, no.

24:23.030 --> 24:25.365
Is it gonna kill you
to keep an open mind about him?

24:25.407 --> 24:28.076
- He is not my type.
- Why not? Because I like him?

24:28.118 --> 24:31.245
I don't know which one,
but there is a game show out there...

24:31.329 --> 24:32.830
with your name on it.

24:32.914 --> 24:35.291
That must be it.
You've hardly said two words to him.

24:35.375 --> 24:36.793
You couldn't hate him already.

24:36.876 --> 24:39.795
It's the game where the mole
keeps sticking his head out.

24:39.879 --> 24:43.424
You have to pound him with the mallet.
You would be a master at that.

24:43.758 --> 24:47.511
Chase may not be as controversial
as your usual brand of men.

24:47.595 --> 24:50.431
They'd erect your statue of you
next to it with perfect hair...

24:50.514 --> 24:51.598
pearls and a bronze mallet.

24:51.682 --> 24:53.350
I want you to think about something.

24:53.434 --> 24:56.520
Tonight, your daughter is celebrating
her three-month anniversary.

24:56.603 --> 24:59.939
What was the last relationship you had
that lasted that long?

25:00.857 --> 25:02.316
I thought so.

25:09.574 --> 25:11.450
Here we are and very sorry.

25:11.534 --> 25:15.162
I had a chance to tell Richard
what I do in the actuarial business.

25:15.246 --> 25:16.664
Yes. It's fascinating.

25:16.747 --> 25:19.082
Lorelai, may I fix you something to drink?

25:19.125 --> 25:20.709
- Gin.
- And?

25:20.793 --> 25:21.835
Gin.

25:22.503 --> 25:24.004
Make that two.

25:25.089 --> 25:27.257
What about
the one-drink-before-dinner rule?

25:27.299 --> 25:29.759
We have guests. We're celebrating.

25:30.343 --> 25:32.970
Chase, here. Let me help you with that.

25:39.602 --> 25:41.270
That was really good.

25:41.312 --> 25:42.855
- It was?
- Yes, it was.

25:42.939 --> 25:44.523
- How was the salad?
- Great.

25:44.607 --> 25:46.650
What about that cheese bread thing?
Too heavy?

25:46.734 --> 25:48.235
- Just heavy enough.
- Really?

25:48.319 --> 25:51.071
Everything was perfect.
Even the soda was good.

25:51.155 --> 25:52.489
I don't know how they do it...

25:52.531 --> 25:55.283
but the Coke here is superior
to the Coke anywhere else.

25:55.325 --> 25:58.452
Okay. At what point during that
did you start making fun of me?

25:58.537 --> 25:59.996
I would never make fun of you.

26:00.080 --> 26:03.499
Not after you ordered three kinds of pasta
because I couldn't decide.

26:03.542 --> 26:05.043
You shouldn't have to decide.

26:05.126 --> 26:07.086
Tonight you should have everything
you want.

26:07.170 --> 26:11.132
I just have to say that I am now
a big fan of the three-month anniversary.

26:11.174 --> 26:12.508
- Yeah?
- Definitely.

26:12.550 --> 26:14.510
They should have T-shirts and newsletters.

26:14.552 --> 26:15.844
I'm glad.

26:16.137 --> 26:17.680
You did all this for me?

26:17.763 --> 26:18.930
It's not over yet.

26:20.558 --> 26:24.728
This is just like that Christmas that
I got a full set of illustrated encyclopedias.

26:25.896 --> 26:27.397
I wanted them.

26:27.856 --> 26:28.815
Good.

26:28.899 --> 26:32.193
One tiramisu, two forks...

26:32.569 --> 26:35.696
- and one meatball to go.
- Thank you.

26:37.866 --> 26:41.285
- You want to explain the meatball?
- It's a mother-daughter thing.

26:43.663 --> 26:45.664
- Ladies first.
- Thank you.

26:52.338 --> 26:54.256
Okay. Have I mentioned...

26:54.340 --> 26:56.758
how much I'm loving
the three-month anniversary thing?

26:56.842 --> 27:00.178
- Yeah, you did.
- Because this tiramisu is so good...

27:00.220 --> 27:04.348
that if the anniversary were completely
sucking right now, this would save it.

27:06.851 --> 27:08.352
- What?
- Nothing.

27:08.436 --> 27:10.479
- Stop it.
- No, you look cute.

27:10.563 --> 27:12.439
- I'm eating.
- You eat cute.

27:12.523 --> 27:14.900
I do not eat cute. No one eats cute.

27:14.984 --> 27:16.735
Bambi, maybe, but he's a cartoon.

27:18.988 --> 27:22.866
After we finish here, we move on
to phase two of the anniversary evening.

27:22.908 --> 27:25.952
Phase two. Sounds very official.
Are there spacesuits involved?

27:26.036 --> 27:27.912
- With matching helmets.
- Impressive.

27:35.962 --> 27:38.798
- Are you a member of the DAR?
- No, I'm not.

27:39.257 --> 27:40.883
D- A-R-N.

27:44.762 --> 27:48.307
It's, like, darn, 'cause it's a play on DAR.

27:49.850 --> 27:51.476
Boy, these carrots sure are tiny.

27:51.560 --> 27:54.896
Chase, I'm simply fascinated
about your work situation.

27:54.939 --> 27:57.024
Tell us how you wound up
back here at home.

27:57.107 --> 28:00.193
You move away to make your fortune,
you end up right back here.

28:00.277 --> 28:02.362
- Isn't life funny?
- Hilarious.

28:02.446 --> 28:03.989
It's a comedy for the masses.

28:04.072 --> 28:06.407
I worked hard
and the company was very good to me.

28:06.449 --> 28:09.910
You know a thing or two
about company loyalty, I assume, Richard.

28:10.328 --> 28:13.164
The company offered me a choice
of East Coast locations.

28:13.247 --> 28:16.083
Sort of a big vote of confidence
in the job I was doing.

28:16.125 --> 28:19.252
Picking your locale.
It's a very coveted position to be in.

28:19.337 --> 28:21.922
I would like to be picking
my locale right now.

28:22.089 --> 28:24.007
So I sat down and made my wish list.

28:24.091 --> 28:27.636
I looked for places that offered
location amenities as well as job growth.

28:27.719 --> 28:30.137
Finally, after days of research...

28:30.180 --> 28:33.307
checking into traffic conditions,
crime rates...

28:33.767 --> 28:36.978
the best school systems,
my decision came down to two places.

28:37.395 --> 28:39.313
One was in New York
and one was in Hartford.

28:39.397 --> 28:41.440
- And you chose Hartford.
- I did at that.

28:43.067 --> 28:45.611
- Is there any more roast?
- Hartford has all the...

28:45.695 --> 28:47.947
cosmopolitan, big-city benefits
New York has...

28:47.989 --> 28:50.324
without actually having to live
in New York.

28:50.366 --> 28:51.867
It just seemed like a no-brainer.

28:51.951 --> 28:54.661
- I'll get Dad some more roast.
- Lee will bring it.

28:54.703 --> 28:57.163
But it's so much more personal this way.

28:57.247 --> 28:58.373
Hurry back.

28:58.457 --> 29:01.334
I just have to know what the allure
of this Stars Hollow is...

29:01.418 --> 29:03.127
I've heard so much about.

29:03.170 --> 29:05.005
Just miles and miles.

29:09.759 --> 29:11.635
- What book did you bring?
- What?

29:11.678 --> 29:14.305
You always bring a book,
and I was just wondering...

29:14.347 --> 29:16.891
what's the three-month anniversary book?

29:16.974 --> 29:18.517
I brought The New Yorker.

29:18.601 --> 29:21.520
- A magazine. Really?
- It's the fiction issue.

29:23.063 --> 29:26.649
People of Stars Hollow,
and our many friends.

29:27.943 --> 29:31.988
It gives me great pleasure
to preside over...

29:32.072 --> 29:35.450
our annual Founders Firelight Festival...

29:35.534 --> 29:37.535
for the 32nd time.

29:40.163 --> 29:43.249
Many a true love has had its start...

29:43.666 --> 29:46.043
right on the spot where I stand.

29:46.919 --> 29:48.879
And I don't mind telling you...

29:49.297 --> 29:53.008
that at this very festival,
right by this gazebo...

29:53.467 --> 29:56.219
is where I met my own true love...

29:56.595 --> 29:58.555
Miss Dora Braithwaite.

29:59.223 --> 30:02.476
We have been married for 43 years...

30:02.893 --> 30:05.270
and it all started right here.

30:06.938 --> 30:08.981
- Ask her to wave.
- I can't.

30:09.232 --> 30:10.483
Why not?

30:10.775 --> 30:13.152
She went to bingo in Bridgeport.

30:14.612 --> 30:16.488
And now, my friends...

30:16.739 --> 30:19.533
if you will join me in lighting the fire.

30:19.909 --> 30:21.910
Okay, take me to the surprise now.

30:22.078 --> 30:25.247
- But you said you want to see the bonfire.
- I do.

30:25.456 --> 30:28.875
- Mayor Porter said...
- Trust me, it'll take a while before it's lit.

30:28.917 --> 30:31.461
We'll have plenty of time
before they're ready.

30:31.628 --> 30:33.254
No, I don't have them.

30:33.338 --> 30:36.924
- Every damn year!
- It was Lenny's responsibility!

30:37.008 --> 30:40.427
Oh, for Pete's sake!
Does anyone have any matches?

30:40.512 --> 30:41.721
Oh, my God!

30:42.055 --> 30:43.639
It's really fascinating stuff.

30:43.723 --> 30:45.808
It sounds it. Tell us more.

30:46.267 --> 30:49.520
We're building new statistical models
that let us do a better job...

30:49.604 --> 30:51.981
of predicting death
than we've ever been able to do.

30:52.064 --> 30:53.440
You might find this interesting.

30:53.524 --> 30:56.651
I've never been one for sitting
at a computer building models.

30:56.735 --> 30:58.611
I'm a client-contact man myself.

30:58.696 --> 31:01.907
But these models give you
a better product to sell to those clients.

31:01.949 --> 31:03.950
- That does sound interesting.
- It is.

31:04.701 --> 31:06.702
If you answer a few simple questions...

31:06.787 --> 31:09.539
I could practically pinpoint the day
you're going to die.

31:09.623 --> 31:10.623
Goodness.

31:10.957 --> 31:13.292
Go ahead. Ask her the questions.

31:13.793 --> 31:14.960
I think I'll pass.

31:15.044 --> 31:16.753
No, Lorelai...

31:16.796 --> 31:20.049
I'd have to feed the information
into a computer to get the answer.

31:20.132 --> 31:21.633
I'm no Kreskin.

31:27.306 --> 31:31.059
Why don't you and Lorelai retire
to the living room for some brandy...

31:31.143 --> 31:32.978
while I help Lee to clean up?

31:33.020 --> 31:34.312
While you do what?

31:34.396 --> 31:36.940
That sounds lovely. Shall we?

31:38.567 --> 31:40.819
Sure. I'm just going...

31:41.653 --> 31:43.279
to go and powder my something.

31:43.363 --> 31:45.948
I'll be back soon.
I'll meet you in the living room.

31:45.990 --> 31:47.991
- I'll be waiting.
- Super.

32:11.598 --> 32:13.766
Lorelai, your mother wants to know if...

32:15.518 --> 32:16.852
Hi, Daddy.

32:17.645 --> 32:19.563
I know this is bad.

32:20.022 --> 32:23.942
I know this brings back all the horrible
aspects of my childhood life for you.

32:24.193 --> 32:26.737
I'm really sorry that we fought last week.

32:26.821 --> 32:28.530
I'm sorry you're disappointed in me.

32:28.614 --> 32:30.574
I wish there was some way I could fix that.

32:30.657 --> 32:33.576
But there isn't, and I accept that
because I am an adult now...

32:33.660 --> 32:36.037
and I am proud of who I have become.

32:36.079 --> 32:39.832
But I am begging you, please
do not make me go back down there...

32:39.875 --> 32:42.002
because that guy is boring.

32:44.170 --> 32:45.838
Emily, she's not up here!

32:47.257 --> 32:48.883
Thank you, Daddy.

33:02.604 --> 33:03.896
- We're here.
- We're where?

33:03.939 --> 33:05.357
- Come on.
- What is this?

33:05.399 --> 33:08.235
- Okay, did you ever see Christine?
- Yes.

33:08.527 --> 33:10.862
It's nothing like that. Come on.

33:15.992 --> 33:18.661
- You brought me to Beirut?
- It's a salvage yard.

33:19.203 --> 33:21.121
And yet it looks so much like Beirut.

33:23.916 --> 33:25.584
Okay, here we are.

33:26.585 --> 33:28.128
- It's a car.
- It is?

33:28.212 --> 33:29.921
- It will be.
- When it grows up?

33:30.005 --> 33:32.257
- When I fix it.
- What?

33:33.550 --> 33:36.010
- It's yours.
- What do you mean it's mine?

33:36.094 --> 33:39.263
I'm building it piece by piece for you.

33:39.514 --> 33:42.433
- No.
- Yeah. I started with the frame.

33:42.517 --> 33:44.810
The seats and the windshield
went in yesterday.

33:44.894 --> 33:47.229
- You're building me a car?
- It's gonna take a while.

33:47.272 --> 33:48.815
But when I'm done, it'll be great.

33:48.898 --> 33:52.151
- You're building me a car?
- That's right.

33:53.778 --> 33:55.487
I'm building you a car.

33:55.571 --> 33:58.156
This is crazy. Why would you do this?

33:58.616 --> 34:00.659
I don't know. You didn't have one.

34:00.743 --> 34:03.161
You're completely insane.

34:03.245 --> 34:05.538
I didn't want you wasting time
on the bus anymore.

34:05.622 --> 34:09.250
That is valuable time we could be
arguing about your ongoing obsession...

34:09.333 --> 34:10.918
with very confusing Russian authors.

34:10.960 --> 34:12.795
I can't believe this.

34:14.172 --> 34:15.464
Do you like it?

34:15.547 --> 34:17.800
Do I like it? Are you kidding?

34:24.849 --> 34:27.016
- I'll take that as a yes.
- Take it, mister.

34:27.101 --> 34:28.685
Come on, get in.

34:31.688 --> 34:34.608
- I'll fix that.
- Don't. I like it like that.

34:45.702 --> 34:48.411
- This is amazing.
- I'm glad you like it.

34:48.788 --> 34:51.873
I had no idea that three months
was the car anniversary.

34:51.958 --> 34:53.501
Four months, you get a plane.

34:53.583 --> 34:56.628
Boy, relationships sure have changed
since I was a kid.

35:01.008 --> 35:03.844
I'm having
one of those moments right now.

35:03.886 --> 35:05.345
What moments?

35:06.054 --> 35:09.890
One of those moments when everything
is so perfect and so wonderful...

35:10.350 --> 35:14.604
that you almost feel sad because
nothing can ever be this good again.

35:16.856 --> 35:19.066
Basically, I'm depressing you?

35:19.651 --> 35:20.651
Yup.

35:21.694 --> 35:24.488
- You're very weird.
- And you're wonderful.

35:40.087 --> 35:42.589
- Rory.
- Yeah?

35:44.924 --> 35:46.300
I love you.

35:53.599 --> 35:55.225
Did you hear me?

35:57.436 --> 35:58.979
Say something.

36:04.401 --> 36:05.985
I love the car.

36:07.905 --> 36:10.699
- And that's it?
- No, I just...

36:11.074 --> 36:13.659
I'm surprised. I didn't expect...

36:13.743 --> 36:15.202
You don't love me?

36:15.286 --> 36:17.413
No, I just have to think about it
for a minute.

36:17.497 --> 36:19.165
Think about what?

36:19.582 --> 36:21.959
Saying 'I love you'
is a really difficult thing.

36:22.043 --> 36:24.962
- I just did it.
- And you did it really well.

36:25.171 --> 36:26.922
What the hell does that mean?

36:27.006 --> 36:29.383
I'm sorry. Please.

36:29.425 --> 36:31.552
This totally came as a surprise.

36:32.136 --> 36:35.013
With the dinner and the car
and then the...

36:35.097 --> 36:38.725
- I need a minute to think about it.
- This is not something you think about.

36:38.809 --> 36:41.144
This is something
that you either feel or you don't.

36:41.228 --> 36:42.270
Please don't be mad.

36:42.354 --> 36:46.274
Why? Because I say, 'I love you,'
and you want to think about it?

36:46.399 --> 36:50.611
Go home and discuss it with your mother,
make one of your pro-con lists?

36:50.653 --> 36:51.945
Not fair.

36:53.239 --> 36:54.615
I'm sorry.

36:55.783 --> 36:58.619
I'm an idiot.
I don't even know what I was thinking.

37:00.871 --> 37:03.623
Please. It's just not that easy for me.

37:03.791 --> 37:06.126
Saying 'I love you' means a lot.

37:07.127 --> 37:10.755
Think about it from my point of view.
My mom and our life.

37:12.174 --> 37:14.467
My mom said that she loved my dad...

37:14.509 --> 37:16.761
You don't get pregnant
saying 'I love you. '

37:16.803 --> 37:18.054
I know.

37:18.138 --> 37:20.556
I'm just confused. I need to...

37:22.809 --> 37:24.769
It's a really big deal.

37:25.311 --> 37:28.147
- Fine, come on.
- Dean, please don't be mad.

37:29.148 --> 37:30.607
I'll take you home.

37:30.816 --> 37:33.693
Tonight was amazing. It was perfect.

37:34.445 --> 37:36.905
- Please, I swear, I just need a minute...
- Whatever.

37:37.489 --> 37:40.241
It doesn't matter, all right? Let's go.

38:17.986 --> 38:20.071
- Sookie.
- Yes, Jackson?

38:20.530 --> 38:22.239
You know what I'm thinking right now?

38:22.323 --> 38:25.117
That time I roasted some red peppers
over the stove burner...

38:25.201 --> 38:26.785
and singed off my eyebrows?

38:26.869 --> 38:28.203
- No.
- Good.

38:29.121 --> 38:31.790
I'm just thinking, this is really nice.

38:32.541 --> 38:33.792
Me, too.

38:52.393 --> 38:54.728
- You getting some good stuff?
- Yeah.

38:54.812 --> 38:56.980
The firelight really changes people.

38:57.064 --> 39:00.400
Makes them seem happier, freer,
all the troubles completely gone.

39:00.484 --> 39:04.279
I don't think that's the firelight.
I think it's the Founders' Day party punch.

39:04.697 --> 39:06.698
Yeah, that stuff is good.

39:08.242 --> 39:11.078
At some point, are you gonna tell me
what you're doing here?

39:11.161 --> 39:12.912
I'm putting more film in my camera.

39:12.954 --> 39:13.996
What?

39:15.248 --> 39:17.792
I told you, I was at the airport,
and now I'm here.

39:17.876 --> 39:20.211
Sure, when you put it like that.

39:20.712 --> 39:23.923
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but you don't sound happy to see me.

39:23.965 --> 39:28.010
Correct me if I'm wrong, but you have
a tendency to show up and leave suddenly.

39:28.094 --> 39:30.429
Not one of your more charming attributes.

39:30.471 --> 39:32.723
So you're not happy to see me?

39:35.976 --> 39:39.103
I don't know what I'm doing here, okay?
I just missed you.

39:39.897 --> 39:41.648
I wanted to see you.

39:42.357 --> 39:44.442
I don't know what else to say.

39:45.610 --> 39:47.319
I missed you, too.

39:50.740 --> 39:53.075
Since we're both being blunt...

39:53.159 --> 39:54.827
what's the deal with Lorelai?

39:54.911 --> 39:56.912
- What are you talking about?
- Lorelai...

39:56.954 --> 40:00.081
the lady who runs the inn,
and you've told me nothing about.

40:00.291 --> 40:04.503
Been very careful to leave out of any story,
anecdote, or gossip about the town.

40:04.587 --> 40:07.214
- There is no deal with her. We're friends.
- For now.

40:07.297 --> 40:09.257
- Yes.
- And in the future?

40:11.635 --> 40:13.178
She's just...

40:14.638 --> 40:16.473
At times, it seems like...

40:17.224 --> 40:18.725
I don't know.

40:21.102 --> 40:23.103
But I am happy to see you.

40:24.230 --> 40:25.356
Good.

40:26.274 --> 40:28.609
I'm gonna get some party punch.
You want some?

40:28.651 --> 40:30.486
That stuff will kill you.

40:31.570 --> 40:33.613
Some things never change.

40:53.841 --> 40:55.801
Where's the fire department
when you need them?

40:55.885 --> 40:57.845
Aren't you supposed to be in Hartford?

40:57.929 --> 40:59.930
I climbed out the window.

41:00.514 --> 41:03.058
- That's it? You're not curious why?
- No.

41:03.142 --> 41:05.018
That's what I love about you.

41:05.060 --> 41:07.353
- How long have you been here?
- A little while.

41:07.396 --> 41:09.898
Did you see Taylor and Harry
get into a fistfight?

41:11.275 --> 41:14.486
- How did I miss that? I'm so bummed.
- It was good.

41:16.279 --> 41:17.822
Where is Rachel?

41:17.906 --> 41:20.992
She's a Founders' Party punch junkie.

41:21.076 --> 41:23.036
Even the nice girls aren't safe.

41:23.119 --> 41:25.996
She's been running around here,
taking all kinds of pictures.

41:26.039 --> 41:29.292
- She's having a good time.
- I guess so. I hope so.

41:32.712 --> 41:35.506
What's the haps with you two?

41:35.631 --> 41:37.799
The haps? Let's see.

41:37.883 --> 41:39.884
What is the haps?

41:39.968 --> 41:43.304
- I mean, like...
- I know what you meant by 'the haps. '

41:43.472 --> 41:46.224
- You're repeating it a thousand times.
- I was pondering.

41:46.308 --> 41:49.394
- You ponder so slowly.
- Lf I did it fast, it wouldn't be pondering.

41:49.477 --> 41:51.812
Pondering by nature
has a slow connotation.

41:51.896 --> 41:53.272
Okay, fine.

41:55.233 --> 41:57.526
- Is she staying?
- I don't know.

41:58.653 --> 42:01.071
- Do you want her to?
- I don't know.

42:02.198 --> 42:04.575
- She seems to really like you.
- Yeah, she does.

42:04.658 --> 42:07.285
But she doesn't have
the greatest attention span.

42:07.369 --> 42:09.579
- But she is here.
- Yes, she is.

42:10.330 --> 42:14.000
You spend a lot of time debating things.
Is it right, is it wrong?

42:14.084 --> 42:16.044
Should I do this, should I do that?

42:16.128 --> 42:18.630
Sometimes you should just jump in,
and take a shot.

42:18.838 --> 42:21.840
What's the worst that can happen?
She left before. I lived.

42:22.717 --> 42:24.343
Maybe this time...

42:25.678 --> 42:27.846
- I think that's really great.
- You do?

42:28.931 --> 42:30.891
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

42:35.229 --> 42:38.607
- I guess I'm gonna go check up on Rachel.
- That's nice.

42:38.649 --> 42:39.775
What?

42:39.942 --> 42:43.236
That you have somebody
you can go check up on. That's nice.

42:43.278 --> 42:46.447
Yeah, it is, unless she's completely drunk
and throwing up.

42:46.531 --> 42:47.782
Still nice.

42:49.910 --> 42:52.412
- I'll see you tomorrow?
- Tomorrow.

43:22.440 --> 43:24.149
Hi. You've reached Max Medina.

43:24.234 --> 43:26.444
I'm not here now.
Leave a message at the beep...

43:26.486 --> 43:28.946
and I'll get back to you. Thanks.

43:32.200 --> 43:33.826
We just broke up.
