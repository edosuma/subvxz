00:34.521 --> 00:35.401
Why did you take so long?

00:35.841 --> 00:37.241
I was playing in the woods.

00:38.081 --> 00:39.161
Come here.

00:40.721 --> 00:43.681
Look how dirty you are.
I'm tired and sick of you.

00:44.441 --> 00:46.881
Go straight to your room.
No supper for you.

00:47.041 --> 00:49.041
No, mummy, I'm sorry

00:49.601 --> 00:51.921
Go to your room.
I don't want to see you again.

00:52.081 --> 00:52.601
Go to hell.

00:52.761 --> 00:55.281
You're as stupid and stubborn
<i>as</i> that pig of your father.

00:57.441 --> 01:01.281
Stop crying
or you'll be in big trouble.

01:05.561 --> 01:07.041
No, mummy, please...

01:07.201 --> 01:08.001
Mummy...

01:08.441 --> 01:09.641
Please, open the door...

01:09.801 --> 01:12.641
Let me out...
Don't leave me in the dark.

01:14.041 --> 01:15.201
I'm scared.

01:15.921 --> 01:17.481
Open the door...

01:18.841 --> 01:20.961
Please mummy,
I'm sorry...

01:24.961 --> 01:27.121
<i>Don't cry...</i>

01:27.281 --> 01:28.841
<i>don't be afraid.</i>

01:29.001 --> 01:30.681
<i>I'm your friend.</i>

01:31.361 --> 01:33.081
<i>Don't worry.</i>

01:33.241 --> 01:34.641
<i>I'll let you out of here.</i>

01:34.801 --> 01:37.001
<i>You are a good boy.</i>

01:37.161 --> 01:40.161
<i>Don't believe</i> a <i>word
what your mother tells you.</i>

01:41.361 --> 01:44.961
<i>Take this
and you will become invincible.</i>

01:45.641 --> 01:48.401
<i>No-one will hurt you any more.</i>

01:58.641 --> 01:59.121
Karl ?

01:59.721 --> 02:02.001
Karl?
Who's in there?

02:21.921 --> 02:23.241
What's going on?

02:23.401 --> 02:24.681
What's that mask?

05:38.721 --> 05:40.561
<i>All is lost now!</i>

05:41.681 --> 05:44.041
<i>I just need to get out of here.</i>

05:44.961 --> 05:47.841
<i>Without knowledge
we will be free from the Darkness</i>

05:48.521 --> 05:51.841
<i>and once we understand it,
it may be too late.</i>

05:52.801 --> 05:55.481
<i>All my researches have been in vain.</i>

05:56.961 --> 05:58.841
<i>He is too mighty now!</i>

05:59.601 --> 06:02.321
<i>His Legions are nested everywhere.</i>

06:04.081 --> 06:06.801
<i>But I know his darkest secrets.</i>

06:07.201 --> 06:09.281
<i>The seal is the key!</i>

06:09.721 --> 06:13.041
<i>The Salamander viewer knows
the world of shadows</i>

06:13.201 --> 06:16.641
<i>and the twelfth crescent moon
has already opened the gate.</i>

06:17.641 --> 06:21.881
<i>The fourteenth night prepares,
and nothing can stop him.</i>

06:22.361 --> 06:23.161
<i>Oh!</i>

06:23.601 --> 06:24.801
<i>They're here!</i>

06:25.761 --> 06:28.521
<i>The Prince of Light is back
from the Darkness.</i>

06:28.841 --> 06:31.881
<i>And his messengers scrutinize from above.</i>

06:48.521 --> 06:49.841
<i>There they are...</i>

06:50.481 --> 06:51.841
<i>Cursed!</i>

06:52.361 --> 06:53.961
<i>They are coming to take me,</i>

06:54.121 --> 06:55.321
<i>but they will not have...</i>

06:55.481 --> 06:56.561
<i>my soul.</i>

07:25.401 --> 07:27.361
<i>I knew this day would come.</i>

07:27.521 --> 07:31.521
<i>The Antichrist rules the world
and evil is without a face.</i>

07:35.401 --> 07:36.321
<i>He is here!</i>

07:36.721 --> 07:38.601
<i>I can feel his presence.</i>

07:47.801 --> 07:48.921
<i>He is everywhere,</i>

07:49.081 --> 07:52.121
<i>he has the gift of all-presence
and mutation.</i>

07:52.281 --> 07:56.321
<i>He can transform at will,
make himself visible or invisible.</i>

07:56.481 --> 07:59.601
<i>One who evokes his power,
will have great privileges.</i>

07:59.921 --> 08:03.561
<i>But he will be subjugated to his will,
as a puppet in his hands.</i>

08:03.961 --> 08:05.881
<i>History has known dark ages,</i>

08:06.041 --> 08:07.841
<i>dominated by his servants,</i>

08:08.001 --> 08:09.601
<i>violent and barbaric.</i>

08:09.761 --> 08:12.641
<i>But now, we are truly at the end of time.</i>

08:13.321 --> 08:16.801
<i>The era of violence
and blood has already begun.</i>

09:51.081 --> 09:55.361
They say the wicked always end up
with the wicked.

09:55.521 --> 10:00.041
We both know where we are from,
and where we are heading.

10:00.921 --> 10:04.401
We have made a pact, and must honour it.

10:04.881 --> 10:06.361
That's fair.

10:12.161 --> 10:12.841
No!

10:13.481 --> 10:15.361
Nothing's going to stop me!

10:16.041 --> 10:18.081
I am different from the others,

10:18.801 --> 10:21.361
I'm not interested in cash

10:22.081 --> 10:25.281
money is simply a means to get to the top,

10:26.681 --> 10:28.201
to the real power.

10:28.641 --> 10:32.641
That's the only reason
I went into politics.

10:33.561 --> 10:34.361
My enemies

10:35.361 --> 10:39.761
are the same people
that pretend to be on my side,

10:40.361 --> 10:42.761
not the newspapers and televisions.

10:43.281 --> 10:47.641
They are sabotaging my electoral campaign,

10:48.001 --> 10:49.721
and I'm asking you...

10:50.401 --> 10:53.081
to deal with this problem!

10:58.641 --> 11:01.521
I've made my choice in this world,

11:01.961 --> 11:07.641
and you promised me you would help me
to finalize my work.

11:08.801 --> 11:11.521
I am not afraid of you.

11:12.161 --> 11:14.321
I am not afraid of you.

11:41.681 --> 11:43.281
I'm here, I told you...

11:44.201 --> 11:45.681
yes,yes.

11:46.361 --> 11:49.241
We're waiting for the forensics to arrive
and do the examination.

11:49.961 --> 11:51.561
Yeah, no one's moving...

11:52.321 --> 11:54.401
yeah, and the photographs, yes...yes,

11:55.081 --> 11:57.241
is this conversation really necessary?

11:58.681 --> 12:01.001
Listen, I have guests here,

12:01.401 --> 12:04.361
so <i>I'll</i> let you do your job.
Speak to you later.

12:06.081 --> 12:08.121
Beginners in the Operations Room:

12:08.281 --> 12:11.161
a couple of years sitting behind the desk,
and...

12:11.961 --> 12:13.401
when you get cases like these

12:13.561 --> 12:17.161
they are more anxious than a mother
on her son's first day at school.

12:17.321 --> 12:19.121
All we have to do now

12:19.281 --> 12:21.441
is to keep the people away
from the marked-off area

12:21.841 --> 12:23.041
and just stay here on the spot,

12:23.201 --> 12:25.881
with a little bit of breakfast
in our stomachs.

12:26.041 --> 12:26.921
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

12:27.401 --> 12:29.761
Hans Ebert, Interpol, Hamburg office.

12:29.921 --> 12:30.881
We've met before.

12:31.041 --> 12:33.001
I've been with the flying squad
for a couple of weeks.

12:33.361 --> 12:35.281
Yeah yeah, I remember, I remember:

12:35.521 --> 12:37.561
you're on somebody's trail.

12:37.841 --> 12:41.281
Well, here we have no crime weapon,

12:41.441 --> 12:46.081
we have no hands to bag to preserve traces
of contact with the attacker.

12:46.641 --> 12:48.921
We have nothing, it seems, for the moment.

12:49.081 --> 12:51.121
You're right, “for the time being”.

12:52.081 --> 12:54.681
So then... let me guess:
no limbs have been found.

12:54.841 --> 12:57.241
Are there any witnesses?
Who found the body?

12:57.401 --> 12:58.761
No limbs, no head.

12:59.601 --> 13:02.321
If you consider the point
where the body was found,

13:02.481 --> 13:03.921
if it hadn't been for the smell

13:04.921 --> 13:05.881
and the blood,

13:06.641 --> 13:09.481
a passer-by might have easily thought
it was just a pile of clothes.

13:10.041 --> 13:11.641
And I'm not exaggerating.

13:19.441 --> 13:22.841
The body was found by the owner
of that house over there.

13:23.001 --> 13:24.281
He is with two officers right now,

13:24.921 --> 13:28.001
and I really doubt he's strong enough
to go anywhere.

13:29.321 --> 13:30.201
Mauro!

13:31.201 --> 13:33.481
Please, take a look at this short report.

13:35.281 --> 13:37.281
The papers were left on the corpse.

13:37.441 --> 13:41.281
The position of the blood stains indicates
that the victim was murdered on the spot,

13:41.441 --> 13:42.881
after a brief struggle.

13:43.241 --> 13:46.561
Given the lack of tracks close
to the scene of the crime,

13:46.721 --> 13:49.761
the removed limbs were probably carried
somewhere else in containers.

13:52.361 --> 13:53.481
Any tyre marks?

13:53.961 --> 13:54.721
Yes.

13:55.641 --> 13:56.681
Yes, they're over there,

13:57.561 --> 13:58.481
near the gate.

13:58.641 --> 13:59.801
They don't look recent,

13:59.961 --> 14:02.801
but the forensic guys will see
if they're of any use.

14:02.961 --> 14:07.241
Good. Let's have a look around while
we wait for the forensic examination.

14:08.441 --> 14:10.361
We might try and connect

14:10.521 --> 14:15.081
this mornings situation with the case
of two months ago, and the one of last week.

14:16.681 --> 14:20.241
I would say that there is a good chance
the killer is one and the same.

14:20.401 --> 14:25.521
Yeah yeah, we all naturally thought about
the murder of the girl in Lungotevere di San Paolo.

14:25.681 --> 14:28.041
Maybe that's why they brought
you here to Italy.

14:29.441 --> 14:33.841
As you said, I am on someone's trail,
something to do with esoterism.

14:34.121 --> 14:35.761
Yeah. So...

14:35.921 --> 14:38.721
I'm sure you will have read all
the reports on the previous cases.

14:38.881 --> 14:41.921
So let's not waste any time,
please tell me what you think about it.

14:42.481 --> 14:44.281
Well, the type of victim is different:

14:44.441 --> 14:46.081
it may indicate a random contact.

14:46.241 --> 14:49.201
I have reason to believe that
the perpetrator is working on his own.

14:49.361 --> 14:51.081
The bodies have not been hidden,

14:51.241 --> 14:54.321
in this case even
the documents have been left here.

14:56.081 --> 14:57.721
The removal of the limbs

14:58.161 --> 14:59.761
points to a ritual murder.

15:00.081 --> 15:01.481
I have reason to believe,

15:02.521 --> 15:04.601
and I am saying this to you in confidence,

15:05.441 --> 15:08.721
that there may be links
with serial killings in Germany

15:08.881 --> 15:10.441
in the 1980s,

15:10.921 --> 15:12.801
attributed to Karl the Butcher.

15:13.121 --> 15:14.361
The Butcher of Hamburg?

15:14.521 --> 15:15.841
Christ, I remember that period.

15:16.201 --> 15:20.041
Over here we were working
with two magnifying glasses and a carrier bag.

15:20.681 --> 15:24.961
And do you think in Hamburg that he might
have returned after such a long time?

15:25.161 --> 15:27.081
It can not be a copycat?

15:27.241 --> 15:31.241
We cannot rule out anything with certainty,
but I doubt it is an imitator.

15:32.401 --> 15:33.201
You're not joking!

15:33.361 --> 15:35.801
You've just brought Karl the Butcher
into the picture!

15:35.961 --> 15:37.881
How can you be so sure?

15:38.041 --> 15:40.641
Rome may not have all the bridges
that you've got,

15:41.321 --> 15:44.161
but it's still got its own shit running
through the city:

15:44.321 --> 15:48.001
an obsessive maybe,
another sadist nihilist.

15:48.161 --> 15:50.361
As I was saying, my leads...

15:51.001 --> 15:53.361
Yeah, go ahead, I'm sorry.
I was listening.

15:54.361 --> 15:56.361
Only I'm just not convinced.

15:56.521 --> 15:59.721
I really hate mornings
when so many things happen.

16:00.401 --> 16:03.441
After the last murder
we had little to go on.

16:03.601 --> 16:05.961
Then, that little turned into nothing.

16:06.121 --> 16:08.201
No one managed to build a valid profile:

16:08.481 --> 16:11.481
movements, links with victims,
the motives.

16:11.881 --> 16:14.121
The brutality of the murders
was the only constant,

16:14.281 --> 16:16.361
yet the method used was different.

16:16.801 --> 16:20.681
We didn't find any murder weapon,
nor physical traces of the murderer.

16:21.321 --> 16:23.481
I wasn't involved directly at the time,

16:23.721 --> 16:28.361
but I studied the case quite a bit,
and I know the persons who worked on it:

16:28.841 --> 16:30.881
I am still in touch with them.

16:31.401 --> 16:35.161
Did you ever manage to figure out
why the murders suddenly stopped?

16:35.321 --> 16:37.921
And how can you be sure
that Karl is still alive?

16:38.401 --> 16:40.001
I cannot explain that to you,

16:41.241 --> 16:44.601
but we have always felt that one day
he might be back.

16:45.121 --> 16:49.041
I also have some materials that you need
to see in order to follow my theories.

16:49.601 --> 16:53.041
Part of the investigation done
by one of my contacts in Hamburg.

16:53.401 --> 16:55.881
I understand that you may think it crazy

16:56.041 --> 16:58.121
and maybe a waste of energy,

16:58.281 --> 17:02.481
but I need someone like you that is
able to move around this city.

17:02.641 --> 17:06.481
And I don't think that you have
made progress in any real direction.

17:07.441 --> 17:08.601
Mmh. You're right about that,

17:08.761 --> 17:12.241
but I don't think three murders are enough
to follow that type of trail.

17:12.401 --> 17:15.921
We will soon find ourselves in the same
situation that you were in Germany.

17:16.560 --> 17:19.281
Hans, I will let my team
take over at the scene.

17:19.441 --> 17:21.721
You and I will take this further,
I want to know more.

17:21.881 --> 17:25.001
However, I don't think we have any choice.
So I will help you.

17:25.921 --> 17:31.121
This is where we found the body.
Down there. No head, no arms, no legs...

17:31.681 --> 17:33.001
Just like last time.

17:34.041 --> 17:37.881
Good God, just what we needed.
Castellari is down there.

17:38.041 --> 17:39.961
Yeah, Cozzi is here too,

17:40.121 --> 17:42.801
he will be here to oversee
the forensic report.

17:43.081 --> 17:46.961
Seeing someone cut into pieces early
in the morning will surely make his day,

17:47.121 --> 17:48.281
I'm telling you.

17:48.441 --> 17:49.561
Oh, look...

17:49.841 --> 17:51.161
<i>I'm just trying to do my job here.</i>

17:52.721 --> 17:53.801
D'Amato,

17:53.961 --> 17:55.361
what a surprise to see you here!

17:55.521 --> 17:58.041
What a nice coincidence...
I love coincidences.

17:58.921 --> 18:03.081
So, you were passing around here,
and you saw the body down there

18:03.241 --> 18:04.241
or maybe...

18:04.521 --> 18:05.921
you are on duty?

18:06.361 --> 18:09.641
The inspector was one of the first
to reach the crime scene.

18:09.801 --> 18:11.561
He's been here since the report came in.

18:11.721 --> 18:12.601
Forget about it, Hans...

18:13.921 --> 18:15.961
Oh, our dear esteemed German colleague,

18:16.441 --> 18:17.601
Fritz Herbert.

18:18.001 --> 18:20.841
I see you two are getting on very well?

18:21.681 --> 18:23.321
There's a spark between you!

18:24.321 --> 18:24.841
Hans,

18:25.401 --> 18:26.521
the name is Hans.

18:26.841 --> 18:27.441
Hans...

18:28.121 --> 18:28.961
I prefer Fritz.

18:29.121 --> 18:29.641
Anyway- --

18:29.961 --> 18:31.921
Hans, tell me,

18:32.081 --> 18:35.681
has your “investigative activity”
been successful,

18:35.841 --> 18:40.561
as one would expect
from two “hounds” like you?

18:40.841 --> 18:42.961
We have nothing significant to report.

18:43.401 --> 18:46.961
Yeah, “without the will to scrutinise,
the eye will not see”, eh?

18:48.041 --> 18:49.361
Wise words,

18:49.521 --> 18:51.281
Very wise words, Doctor Cozzi.

18:51.561 --> 18:52.601
Very wise...

18:53.241 --> 18:56.481
You know, dear colleagues,
normally it would be better

18:56.841 --> 19:00.601
to keep two bad police officers
AWAY from a crime scene,

19:01.281 --> 19:05.281
so there is no risk of any contamination,
proof contamination.

19:06.121 --> 19:08.041
But with you, there is nothing,

19:08.201 --> 19:11.841
no such risk,
because you are not doing anything here,

19:12.001 --> 19:15.201
you're absolutely useless,
in every circumstance!

19:17.561 --> 19:18.481
Gentlemen,

19:19.041 --> 19:21.521
today I am coordinating operations:

19:21.841 --> 19:25.361
I can't even imagine
what all those idiots would do

19:25.521 --> 19:28.041
if one of you two were in charge!

19:29.161 --> 19:31.681
I don't know what I'm still doing here,
at my age,

19:33.561 --> 19:35.681
doing other people's work!

19:38.961 --> 19:40.761
As fine investigators,

19:40.921 --> 19:44.561
capable only of wandering around the city
without a clear idea in your brain,

19:44.721 --> 19:49.081
let's concentrate
on searching for the killer!

19:50.001 --> 19:52.201
Or at least pretend to try!

19:52.361 --> 19:54.361
Try to remember a couple of things,

19:54.521 --> 19:57.761
two “insignificant” things,
two “insignificant” details:

19:58.001 --> 20:03.601
the first is that at night a pervert is
going around and slaughtering people,

20:04.161 --> 20:05.761
and the second,

20:06.681 --> 20:11.041
this pervert is a brute
with a superhuman strength.

20:12.201 --> 20:14.841
Yes please,
let's see some action, at last!

20:15.841 --> 20:17.161
Back in my days

20:17.321 --> 20:19.961
we didn't have all this technology,

20:20.121 --> 20:23.201
we just had to keep our eyes open
that's all.

20:23.481 --> 20:26.201
You bunch of amateurs!

20:26.681 --> 20:27.401
Come on Lewis...

20:28.081 --> 20:29.361
these fucking young people

20:29.521 --> 20:31.361
don't know shit from psychology...

20:31.521 --> 20:34.441
Ridiculous, doesn't he realise
he's talking nonsense?

20:35.281 --> 20:39.281
He talks <i>as</i> if we were working in
a town of a few hundred people.

20:39.441 --> 20:41.041
It's not the criminals,

20:41.201 --> 20:43.881
but people like him that
make you hate this job.

20:44.041 --> 20:44.801
Yeah yeah,

20:44.961 --> 20:47.561
I learned to take no
notice over the years.

20:47.721 --> 20:50.081
And I never said I hate this job.

20:50.241 --> 20:52.081
But I... I don't love it either.

20:52.241 --> 20:54.921
Let us keep as far as possible
away from those two,

20:55.081 --> 20:56.881
and do our own investigations.

22:29.801 --> 22:30.801
Ah, dear!

22:33.441 --> 22:39.161
Come here, and put that
splendid gift on my desk!

22:41.721 --> 22:42.561
At last!

22:44.161 --> 22:45.361
At last!

23:00.961 --> 23:02.041
Perhaps

23:02.441 --> 23:05.641
you don't realise what
we have here today, my dear Liliana!

23:07.001 --> 23:09.801
Professor,
you've talked about this all the time

23:09.961 --> 23:11.801
in the last few days!

23:13.041 --> 23:17.241
I imagine it will become
the showpiece of your collection.

23:18.561 --> 23:23.441
None of us, no one indeed,
can calculate its worth!

23:24.961 --> 23:26.481
Its power!

23:32.641 --> 23:35.401
More than 1,500 years ago

23:36.041 --> 23:38.401
a man who came from nowhere,

23:38.561 --> 23:40.681
Attila the king of the Huns,

23:42.481 --> 23:44.761
managed to bring terror

23:45.401 --> 23:46.481
to the world!

23:48.681 --> 23:51.361
Historians of
the past have passed down to us

23:51.721 --> 23:54.961
hundreds of legends about him,

23:56.201 --> 24:00.121
about the origin
of the strength of his terrifying army.

24:03.161 --> 24:04.281
The Huns

24:05.601 --> 24:07.001
came from the east,

24:08.201 --> 24:11.801
ransacking the villages
of their Germanic enemies,

24:12.561 --> 24:14.001
burning their land

24:15.201 --> 24:17.881
and devouring their women and children!

24:21.121 --> 24:24.761
Blood made him unstoppable

24:25.521 --> 24:26.921
on the battlefield.

24:28.401 --> 24:33.121
He brought Europe to its knees,
and for many years made

24:33.281 --> 24:34.801
the Roman Empire anxious

24:34.961 --> 24:38.201
and in fear of a terrifying invasion.

24:42.281 --> 24:48.041
We will never know how
Attila came to obtain this gift.

24:48.521 --> 24:52.001
Some say it was
in a village on the Danube,

24:52.401 --> 24:55.721
from witches celebrating
the Cult of the Flesh.

24:56.481 --> 24:58.361
Others that

25:00.361 --> 25:03.161
it came from
the helmet of Attila's brother,

25:04.601 --> 25:05.561
Bleda,

25:06.321 --> 25:10.721
who had died in mysterious circumstances
during the march westwards,

25:11.881 --> 25:16.881
and that Bleda's
spirit lived on in the metal

25:17.801 --> 25:19.961
it was forged with.

25:20.961 --> 25:22.121
Spirit...

25:22.761 --> 25:27.081
do you think that the spirits
of both brothers could still be alive?

25:27.801 --> 25:31.201
How was it that their enemies
managed to stop them?

25:33.321 --> 25:34.721
Hehe, the light!

25:36.921 --> 25:37.921
Attila

25:38.641 --> 25:44.681
would have hesitated only when faced by
what was sacred for all peoples of the world.

25:45.041 --> 25:50.801
It was Pope Leon I who paid a
visit to the King of the Huns,

25:51.441 --> 25:54.961
and it was he, who managed
to stop his march on Rome.

25:56.481 --> 26:02.961
So it was that Attila gave up his idea of
invading the capital of the Western Empire.

26:05.201 --> 26:10.001
A bloodthirsty warrior,
kept away from the battlefield,

26:11.121 --> 26:13.001
loses all his power,

26:15.401 --> 26:20.441
and it was the very blood
that kept him strong in war

26:23.041 --> 26:26.001
that took his final breath:

26:27.281 --> 26:29.601
he died in his sleep,

26:30.561 --> 26:32.761
from a brain haemorrhage.

26:34.441 --> 26:35.721
...and now

26:35.881 --> 26:39.201
you have this power in your hands,
professor.

26:40.441 --> 26:42.281
My dear Liliana,

26:43.121 --> 26:48.041
I think it's time we start preparing

26:49.641 --> 26:53.561
and send the invitations for our party.

26:55.281 --> 26:57.961
Now that this object is here,

26:58.921 --> 27:00.921
it's time indeed

27:01.081 --> 27:03.161
to start getting ready.

27:04.521 --> 27:07.161
You'll take care of everything,
won't you dear?

27:13.361 --> 27:14.521
Attila

27:16.441 --> 27:18.601
had an army and a kingdom:

27:20.721 --> 27:24.201
but I don't want
all the blood in the world!

27:26.361 --> 27:27.881
I would be happy...

27:30.361 --> 27:32.801
with just a goblet full!

28:17.241 --> 28:18.161
Hi.

28:19.761 --> 28:21.161
I've just finished...

28:23.641 --> 28:25.401
I agree with you, my love.

28:25.801 --> 28:28.281
No, no, don't worry,

28:28.441 --> 28:29.961
I have the car.

28:30.601 --> 28:32.001
Yes, my love...

28:32.161 --> 28:34.081
But... where are you now?

28:35.121 --> 28:37.001
So <i>I'll</i> pick you up.

28:37.841 --> 28:39.921
See you soon...kisses.

28:47.641 --> 28:50.321
I have to go, old man. Ciao.

29:22.601 --> 29:23.721
Hello.

29:26.401 --> 29:28.081
I was looking for you, my dear.

29:29.801 --> 29:30.961
Of course.

29:34.081 --> 29:37.681
Well, there are always
dangers in such situations.

29:38.801 --> 29:39.761
This evening?

29:40.481 --> 29:41.641
I don't think so.

29:43.801 --> 29:45.801
Now I'm waiting for someone...

30:29.601 --> 30:31.001
a nightmare!

30:31.161 --> 30:33.121
I've never seen anything like that.

30:34.241 --> 30:35.721
Thank God I had a light lunch.

30:35.881 --> 30:38.161
But I really need to drink something.

30:44.281 --> 30:45.641
Here is some medicine.

30:47.721 --> 30:48.321
Thank you.

30:48.921 --> 30:50.201
It's Scottish.

30:50.961 --> 30:52.721
Oh, I see. You treat yourself well.

30:52.881 --> 30:54.041
I don't drink.

30:54.201 --> 30:55.681
I keep it here for my guests.

30:56.401 --> 30:58.481
You don't strike me as someone
who has many guests.

30:58.841 --> 31:01.161
Actually I don't have so much room here...

31:01.321 --> 31:03.321
I still have to bring in my equipment.

31:03.801 --> 31:05.121
I have just moved in here.

31:07.321 --> 31:09.001
Where did you get that video?

31:09.361 --> 31:10.961
Was it found on a crime scene?

31:11.121 --> 31:12.881
Or maybe you smuggled it out?

31:13.641 --> 31:18.401
These scenes are not to be shown to anyone.
Do not talk to anyone about it,

31:19.001 --> 31:20.041
it's too dangerous.

31:20.761 --> 31:22.561
Who do I have to talk to, huh?

31:24.121 --> 31:26.121
Those idiots in the flying squad?

31:27.121 --> 31:32.081
I received this information from a file
in a parcel sent to me anonymously.

31:33.361 --> 31:34.361
And I also...

31:34.921 --> 31:37.281
received this...

31:39.481 --> 31:40.601
inscription.

31:44.721 --> 31:46.521
Is it a puzzle?

31:48.001 --> 31:49.761
Do we have to call in the decoders?

31:49.921 --> 31:51.761
I don't think that is necessary.

31:52.161 --> 31:54.281
The Sator Square is a palindrome,

31:55.281 --> 31:58.321
a phrase that you read forward
the same as you read backwards.

31:58.681 --> 32:00.441
Have you ever heard of the magic square?

32:00.721 --> 32:03.921
No, I did technical studies at school, so...

32:04.081 --> 32:08.841
A magic square is a popular Latin
inscription found during archaeological digs.

32:09.201 --> 32:11.121
One of these, the SATOR,

32:11.281 --> 32:14.601
was found in Rome
in the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore.

32:15.001 --> 32:19.201
Are you saying that this SATOR
has something to do with Satanism?

32:19.361 --> 32:24.081
If my theory is correct, it is something
more complex and terrifying.

32:24.241 --> 32:27.521
One of the possible anagrams of
SATOR is this interesting one:

32:32.001 --> 32:36.161
As I said, I did technical studies at school,
so can you translate this please?

32:37.081 --> 32:39.801
SATAN, I PRAY TO YOU AND
CONFIDE IN YOUR CUNNING.

32:40.801 --> 32:42.801
I'm sorry Ebert, I don't get it.

32:42.961 --> 32:45.121
What the hell does KTB
have to do with Sator?

32:45.281 --> 32:47.361
As I said, it's only a theory,

32:47.521 --> 32:48.361
but at first,

32:48.521 --> 32:49.801
what we need to do,
is to go to Rome

32:49.961 --> 32:53.521
and find this antiques dealer
who is an expert on esoterism.

32:54.801 --> 32:56.041
Ok, so <i>I'll</i> call the station

32:56.201 --> 32:59.721
and <i>I'll</i> get a couple of men to draw
up a list of the major antiquarians in Rome,

32:59.881 --> 33:02.361
specializing in esoterism.

33:02.521 --> 33:05.881
Excellent. I will call my colleague in
Hamburg to get some more information.

33:06.041 --> 33:06.681
Ok.

33:13.361 --> 33:14.281
Hello?

33:14.601 --> 33:15.481
Hi, it's me. Hans

33:16.041 --> 33:17.161
Hello Hans.
How's it going?

33:17.321 --> 33:17.921
All is Well...

33:18.281 --> 33:21.121
I bet you're having
a great vacation in Italy?

33:21.281 --> 33:21.961
<i>Good weather and all...</i>

33:22.121 --> 33:24.001
but people die just the same.

33:24.401 --> 33:26.401
<i>Listen, Paul.
Karl the Butcher is here</i>

33:26.561 --> 33:27.921
Send me all
the relevant documents.

33:28.481 --> 33:29.641
All right. Will do.

33:29.801 --> 33:33.001
I'll send you all the information,
all I have. No problem.

33:33.161 --> 33:34.681
Thanks. Yes, alright...

33:35.161 --> 33:36.521
But remember...

33:36.681 --> 33:37.801
Don't wake the dead!

33:37.961 --> 33:38.521
Ciao.

33:48.121 --> 33:49.401
What are you looking at?

33:49.561 --> 33:50.481
Asshole!

34:02.761 --> 34:05.441
Look Mina, I told you I would
be home in time for lunch.

34:05.601 --> 34:08.601
I'd love to be home in time for lunch,
but I'm not able to get home in time for lunch.

34:09.681 --> 34:13.321
You can't be always breaking my balls,
every time I'm on the phone with you...

34:58.121 --> 34:59.881
- Do you like it?
- I'm sorry?

35:00.041 --> 35:02.001
I asked if you like this dress.

35:02.441 --> 35:04.081
I would like to make you happy.

35:04.521 --> 35:06.801
I've seen you walking down the street,

35:06.961 --> 35:08.921
I was thinking of giving you a gift.

35:09.601 --> 35:12.441
You are so elegant and so pretty.

35:13.841 --> 35:15.721
You are very kind,

35:15.881 --> 35:17.601
but please do not go to any trouble...

35:18.401 --> 35:19.641
Don't be afraid of me.

35:20.361 --> 35:23.201
I'm not a stranger offering sweets:

35:23.361 --> 35:25.761
it's just a gift from me to you.

35:27.081 --> 35:29.081
Your compliments are kind enough.

35:30.041 --> 35:31.201
There's really no need.

35:31.841 --> 35:34.081
Oh, you think I'm a nasty person?

35:34.561 --> 35:36.081
Tell me what you think:

35:36.761 --> 35:38.321
if you don't trust me,

35:38.641 --> 35:40.321
I will just go away.

35:40.641 --> 35:44.321
I will go, but with a broken heart!

35:59.361 --> 36:00.481
Don't scream!

36:00.641 --> 36:01.961
- It's useless!
- Let me go...

36:03.401 --> 36:04.761
Don't cry bitch!

36:04.921 --> 36:06.121
I'm no you like it.

36:09.881 --> 36:10.881
Don't scream...

36:12.721 --> 36:14.481
No-one will save you.

36:26.561 --> 36:27.801
Yes? Any news?

36:27.961 --> 36:29.761
Wait a second, let me get a pen.

36:34.921 --> 36:35.721
Yeah“_...

36:37.841 --> 36:38.561
thank you..

36:40.001 --> 36:41.121
So we have something?

36:41.281 --> 36:44.921
Here's a list of the main antique dealers
in Rome specializing in esoterism.

36:45.081 --> 36:46.561
And one of them stands out:

36:47.361 --> 36:48.561
Sigismondo Fulci.

36:48.721 --> 36:49.641
Why is that?

36:49.801 --> 36:53.201
Well, I don't know Latin,
but I know Rome like the back of my hand.

36:53.361 --> 36:54.921
Guess where this Fulci shop is?

36:55.601 --> 36:57.801
- I don't know...
- Right next to Santa Maria Maggiore.

36:58.241 --> 36:59.881
Well okay then,

37:00.041 --> 37:01.961
come on let's go,
there's no time to lose.

37:31.001 --> 37:32.401
Holy shit...oh fuck...

37:38.441 --> 37:40.041
Someone got here first.

37:44.481 --> 37:46.361
The room must have been
wrecked during the fight,

37:46.521 --> 37:48.961
but not by someone looking for something.

37:49.641 --> 37:51.681
We may still find something though.

37:51.841 --> 37:53.281
You call this a fight.

38:06.081 --> 38:06.881
Eben,

38:07.761 --> 38:08.801
look here!

38:09.041 --> 38:11.161
The last transaction on this list is with

38:11.321 --> 38:12.721
a Professor Vassago!

38:13.041 --> 38:13.761
KTB.

38:14.681 --> 38:17.881
This is the place, let's go and hear
what the person living there has to say.

38:18.401 --> 38:21.041
What we have to do, D'Amato,
is try not to be aggressive,

38:21.201 --> 38:22.881
but get him to give the game away.

38:23.041 --> 38:24.921
Perhaps we will find
the answer to our riddle.

38:25.081 --> 38:25.801
Yeah.

38:29.801 --> 38:31.561
Wait,
let's shut the door here:

38:31.881 --> 38:34.801
if someone discovers the corpse,
we'll be busy all day.

38:34.961 --> 38:36.761
We'll deal with this mess later.

39:03.201 --> 39:07.001
Did you hear about that poor woman that
was killed and dismembered? Fucking shit!

39:07.761 --> 39:09.961
Yes,
and I'm so scared...

39:11.201 --> 39:14.081
They say,
there is a serial killer going around...

39:14.241 --> 39:17.401
Oh my God,
I'm just so scared about this maniac...

39:18.561 --> 39:20.241
But we still need to work anyway.

39:20.401 --> 39:23.241
We just need to keep a watch
out and hope for the best...

39:43.961 --> 39:45.401
Have you seen Catherine?

39:45.961 --> 39:48.681
She is still playing with a customer.

39:49.481 --> 39:50.641
Yeah, thank you.

40:05.401 --> 40:06.361
Hi.

40:07.281 --> 40:09.001
There you are...at last!

40:11.801 --> 40:14.321
You know, how much
I miss those sweet lips.

40:20.521 --> 40:22.001
Thanks, you're so sweet.

40:24.481 --> 40:26.601
I'm always thinking of you,
you know.

40:30.441 --> 40:31.241
Come here.

41:09.881 --> 41:13.361
So... do you still want to marry me anyway,
my darling?

41:13.841 --> 41:15.521
Sure... I love you!

41:20.361 --> 41:21.361
And then?

41:22.361 --> 41:25.561
And what will people say
when they know

41:25.721 --> 41:28.041
that you married a bitch?

41:29.161 --> 41:31.641
I really don't care:

41:31.801 --> 41:33.441
maybe I want a bitch!

41:34.401 --> 41:35.641
Oh, what a gentleman!

41:36.441 --> 41:38.241
- I have to pee...
- Ok

41:38.401 --> 41:39.881
<i>I'll</i> be right back:

41:40.281 --> 41:41.321
don't move.

41:41.601 --> 41:42.601
I won't.

42:32.881 --> 42:36.321
I believe the cops have
fallen into our trap:

42:36.961 --> 42:39.961
they've found the book with the addresses,
as scheduled.

42:40.481 --> 42:43.721
Everything is going according
to our plan.

42:56.121 --> 42:57.081
Professor Vassago,

42:57.841 --> 42:59.601
these two gentlemen from the police

43:00.441 --> 43:02.441
are here to speak with you.

43:03.121 --> 43:05.201
Officers,
I am professor Vassago.

43:05.361 --> 43:07.521
- Aristide D'Amato, police authorities.
- Hans Ebert.

43:07.921 --> 43:09.321
I bid you both welcome.

43:09.481 --> 43:11.481
- Would you like to sit down?
- Yes, please.

43:11.641 --> 43:15.001
Liliana, why don't you get something
to drink for these officers.

43:15.161 --> 43:16.561
Would you like a cup of tea?

43:17.401 --> 43:18.601
No thanks, we're ok.

43:18.921 --> 43:21.121
We hope not to bother you,
Professor Vassago.

43:21.281 --> 43:23.121
You have a wonderful house.

43:23.281 --> 43:24.961
I see that you collect antiques...

43:25.121 --> 43:26.921
Yes, it's my only job!

43:27.401 --> 43:31.201
You see, inside there I have maps, books

43:31.361 --> 43:35.201
and works of art that are
really rare and valuable!

43:35.801 --> 43:37.401
I am a collector

43:38.321 --> 43:39.441
and an active cataloguer,

43:39.601 --> 43:40.561
but first of all,

43:40.721 --> 43:42.681
I'm a lover of history.

43:42.841 --> 43:45.241
My colleague and I are making
investigations on some...

43:45.401 --> 43:47.921
illegal trafficking in materials

43:48.361 --> 43:49.761
and we would like to ask
you a few questions.

43:50.361 --> 43:52.041
We need all the help we can get

43:52.201 --> 43:54.721
and you are very popular
amongst all the traders in the city.

43:55.441 --> 43:57.081
Illegal trafficking?

43:57.241 --> 43:59.641
Gentlemen,
you are offending my profession

43:59.801 --> 44:03.121
I do not trade in ivory
necklaces sold by poachers,

44:03.281 --> 44:06.121
if you're looking for this,
you should go to the antique markets

44:06.281 --> 44:08.921
We respect your business,
but as I told you,

44:09.081 --> 44:11.161
we know that you meet
a lot of antiquarians

44:11.321 --> 44:13.961
and any additional informaton
can be useful at the moment.

44:14.121 --> 44:17.201
Oh yes I already had this problem,
in fact.

44:18.121 --> 44:19.401
But I wonder:

44:19.561 --> 44:23.081
why aren't the State forestry
corps dealing with that?

44:23.641 --> 44:25.601
The police have already
made investigations.

44:25.761 --> 44:28.161
There have been some complications.

44:28.681 --> 44:30.201
Nothing that we can talk about,
I'm sorry.

44:30.361 --> 44:33.161
I understand and accept your apologies,

44:33.321 --> 44:34.761
but...I'm sorry

44:34.921 --> 44:37.161
I just don't think I can help you.

44:38.401 --> 44:41.921
You see, I only work with honest traders

44:42.081 --> 44:46.121
and the ivory of my collections and the
one of the antiquarians I work with,

44:46.921 --> 44:48.521
is absolutely legal.

44:49.441 --> 44:52.001
- Vassago, I suppose you are
a lover of the codes. -Yeah.

44:52.161 --> 44:55.201
We found an inscription
bearing the symbol KTB,

44:55.961 --> 44:57.401
have you ever heard of it?

44:58.081 --> 45:01.281
KTB you say?

45:03.001 --> 45:05.361
Uhm,
it could be the Semitic root,

45:05.521 --> 45:08.681
now that you mention it...
or maybe Aramaic.

45:11.601 --> 45:12.441
Or...or...North African?

45:13.041 --> 45:14.361
Excuse me.

45:14.681 --> 45:15.721
Oh, you see: age!

45:16.241 --> 45:18.321
My memory plays some tricks on me.

45:18.961 --> 45:19.721
Yes?

45:20.321 --> 45:21.681
L...we're together yes...

45:22.721 --> 45:23.321
where?

45:23.761 --> 45:24.641
I have some books,

45:24.801 --> 45:27.041
and it will take no time, it's just that

45:27.201 --> 45:28.241
unfortunately,

45:28.761 --> 45:34.361
me and my assistant are preparing to host
a little party for some friends this evening,

45:34.881 --> 45:35.761
SO...

45:35.921 --> 45:39.081
Vassago, we just received a
phone call and we must go.

45:39.641 --> 45:41.601
We hope that you can
help us in the future.

45:41.761 --> 45:45.001
Please, check your books and if you
find out something, please just call us.

45:45.561 --> 45:46.881
Of course, <i>I'll</i> surely do that.

45:48.361 --> 45:51.121
Liliana, why don't you take
these gentlemen to the door?

45:52.001 --> 45:54.081
Have a nice day, officers!

46:12.561 --> 46:14.201
Hans, did you see that?

46:14.521 --> 46:16.041
The SATOR? Yes. What's going on?

46:16.201 --> 46:17.241
It was the police station.

46:17.401 --> 46:19.681
We have to go to the suburbs.
There was another murder.

46:20.361 --> 46:21.961
There's no time for shit.

46:22.521 --> 46:25.161
We'll be back later: maybe we will
find a way of getting in unnoticed.

46:36.961 --> 46:39.241
What a waste. A waste.

46:40.361 --> 46:41.801
Oh! Look here.

46:43.121 --> 46:47.521
Dear colleagues, thanks for coming again
and what a pleasure to see you again.

46:47.681 --> 46:49.401
You're doing a very good job, look here!

46:49.561 --> 46:52.241
Another victim,
and what are you doing here?

46:52.881 --> 46:54.721
I don't know what to say:

46:54.881 --> 46:56.921
your investigations are going very well,

46:57.081 --> 46:57.801
too well!

46:58.521 --> 47:01.641
If you carry on like this there
will be more and more work,

47:01.801 --> 47:03.921
and then NOTHING for years,

47:04.081 --> 47:06.401
as everybody will be dead in this city!

47:06.801 --> 47:09.761
Have a look over there,
and tell me what you think of that.

47:11.081 --> 47:14.081
The next few days will
be like HELL for you.

47:14.641 --> 47:16.961
You have got to find me this brute.

47:17.361 --> 47:19.081
Do you know who found the body?

47:19.481 --> 47:21.761
This wonderful body? A young boy!

47:21.921 --> 47:25.041
What the fuck was an eleven
year old boy doing around here?

47:26.921 --> 47:30.401
I have to solve this case
as soon as possible,

47:30.921 --> 47:35.881
even if I have to RIP a
confession out of the two

47:36.241 --> 47:39.241
of you and say that YOU
committed this crime!

47:40.401 --> 47:41.761
Vaffanculo...

48:12.841 --> 48:15.161
I don't believe you understand, you know...

48:15.881 --> 48:17.121
No, it's tomorrow.

48:19.321 --> 48:21.401
The official meeting is for tomorrow...

48:22.801 --> 48:25.641
This evening I will see Mr. Lanza.

48:26.521 --> 48:27.921
Ah, don't worry about this:

48:28.441 --> 48:31.161
don't you pay your lawyers
to resolve this case?

48:32.721 --> 48:35.161
Yes of course, me too.

48:36.241 --> 48:38.801
You know that we can't
talk too much about that.

48:39.441 --> 48:40.041
So,

48:40.201 --> 48:43.481
have a drink and enjoy your life.

48:44.521 --> 48:45.121
Ok? Bye.

48:46.961 --> 48:47.601
I'm sorry,

48:48.201 --> 48:50.361
they've been busting my
balls for the last few days.

48:50.921 --> 48:54.641
Then this idiot calls me to piss me off,

48:55.681 --> 48:58.961
he knows very well I can't
talk about this on the phone.

48:59.721 --> 49:01.561
Are you worried about tomorrow?

49:02.121 --> 49:03.201
Not at all,

49:03.561 --> 49:05.641
it's just a political meeting:

49:07.121 --> 49:11.041
they want me to take the flak,
to save their asses.

49:11.481 --> 49:14.561
But there's no proof, no phone hacking.

49:15.081 --> 49:17.521
And I am in very good hands:

49:18.201 --> 49:20.201
Mr.Lanza, the lawyer,

49:20.361 --> 49:22.441
he knows me very, very well.

49:23.401 --> 49:26.481
He knows my power and
he knows my privileges.

49:27.201 --> 49:29.681
Drugs are a big privilege.

49:29.841 --> 49:31.161
You're right.

49:32.361 --> 49:34.681
We will be relaxing tonight,

49:36.281 --> 49:37.481
you'll see.

49:44.921 --> 49:48.041
What is the name of the professor again?

49:49.761 --> 49:50.921
The antiquarian?

49:52.201 --> 49:53.521
Mr.Vassago:

49:55.241 --> 49:57.001
he's a real benefactor.

49:57.721 --> 50:01.441
He helped me to solve some big problems.

50:03.321 --> 50:06.121
But I don't want to think
about problems this night:

50:06.281 --> 50:08.401
I just want to relax myself.

50:08.561 --> 50:10.561
I just wanna have fun,

50:10.721 --> 50:13.081
and I want to introduce you to him.

50:15.201 --> 50:17.281
We have the same passions.

50:28.601 --> 50:30.241
Welcome, my friend!

50:30.881 --> 50:34.921
Good evening, Mr.Vassago.
Can I introduce you to my wife?

50:35.081 --> 50:36.841
Enchanté Madame.

50:37.081 --> 50:38.601
Pleased to meet you.

50:38.761 --> 50:40.721
Go ahead,
<i>I'll</i> be right there.

50:42.801 --> 50:43.641
I have a...

50:43.801 --> 50:45.241
a beautiful gift for you!

50:45.401 --> 50:48.801
A gift? Oh, my friend you
shouldn't have done that!

50:48.961 --> 50:52.161
Let's see this gift, I'm really intrigued!

50:59.121 --> 51:00.561
Ah, what a surprise!

51:01.561 --> 51:04.601
Is the student trying to
overcome his teacher?

51:05.681 --> 51:07.081
What a beautiful fawn you brought to me:

51:09.601 --> 51:11.601
you are a skilled hunter!

51:12.321 --> 51:14.881
It's just a gift for you, nobody else.

51:16.041 --> 51:19.521
Thank you so much my friend,
but let's go inside:

51:19.681 --> 51:22.281
I have many surprises for you!

51:22.441 --> 51:23.841
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

51:45.921 --> 51:47.921
Honey, who's that girl we've met before?

51:49.681 --> 51:51.441
I think I know her.

51:51.881 --> 51:55.161
Something tells me that
you don't watch television!

51:55.761 --> 51:57.841
She's Karen: she's a soubrette.

51:58.321 --> 52:00.841
She has some problems
with drugs and money,

52:01.561 --> 52:06.721
and sometimes I help her to solve
her issues, you know, with work.

52:07.161 --> 52:09.241
Oh yes, now I remember!

52:20.161 --> 52:24.081
Maybe you can put in a good word for me,
we could become a couple.

52:24.761 --> 52:26.121
Oh... Sure,

52:27.681 --> 52:28.481
why not.

52:40.041 --> 52:41.001
Nice

52:41.161 --> 52:43.041
beautiful party, beautiful dancer,

52:43.481 --> 52:44.721
beautiful woman.

52:44.961 --> 52:45.681
Nice place, eh?

52:48.401 --> 52:50.361
- Let's have a drink?
- All right.

52:53.801 --> 52:55.241
That's for you.Thank-you.

52:55.521 --> 52:56.601
That's for me.

52:57.641 --> 52:58.721
Cheers.

53:01.441 --> 53:04.561
I want to introduce you to a friend,
the lawyer Lanza,

53:04.721 --> 53:07.561
I told you before. He's
a good friend of mine.

53:07.881 --> 53:08.881
Here's the man himself. Mr.Lanza.

53:10.481 --> 53:11.881
Oh! You look charming.

53:12.281 --> 53:12.721
Oh..thanks.

53:12.881 --> 53:15.001
- It's a real pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure.

53:15.161 --> 53:18.561
Come over, the professor
said he will be with us shortly.

53:19.401 --> 53:22.241
I told you the night would be interesting.

53:34.441 --> 53:36.721
Oh, you wonderful baby.

53:40.041 --> 53:43.521
We should ask the professor,
if we can sleep here...

53:44.361 --> 53:45.721
at the villa.

53:46.521 --> 53:47.881
Ooh... what do you think?

53:56.961 --> 53:58.361
Yeah, why not?

53:59.001 --> 54:01.841
Maybe you should ask Lanza to join us?

54:02.001 --> 54:03.761
Yes, I already have.

54:20.521 --> 54:23.321
- Hi. How are you?
- Nice to meet you.

54:45.281 --> 54:47.081
Nice surprise.

54:48.521 --> 54:50.121
Oh yes... I love surprises.

54:50.281 --> 54:50.841
Yes?

54:52.201 --> 54:53.641
Best quality.

55:43.681 --> 55:44.321
Good evening.

55:45.321 --> 55:47.481
The professor is in his study:

55:48.241 --> 55:52.001
he has spent the whole day
preparing for this evening,

55:52.641 --> 55:55.001
and still has some work to finish off.

55:55.761 --> 56:01.841
He will be here shortly, but in the
meantime please make yourselves at home.

56:02.561 --> 56:06.001
We're waiting for him,
it's a pity that he's not here with us,

56:06.721 --> 56:08.041
but it's okay.

56:09.881 --> 56:11.081
Do I know you? Who are you?

56:11.721 --> 56:13.121
What's your name?

56:13.561 --> 56:14.321
Liliana.

56:15.601 --> 56:18.441
I am the professor's personal assistant.

56:18.921 --> 56:20.641
So will you take a drink with us?

56:21.241 --> 56:22.121
No thank you.

56:23.001 --> 56:25.041
<i>I'll</i> drink with you later.

56:25.601 --> 56:27.761
We're looking forward to that.

56:27.921 --> 56:29.001
Whenever you want.

56:40.761 --> 56:45.481
The time has come to really
open the eyes of our guests,

56:46.521 --> 56:48.641
and show them the gates

56:49.361 --> 56:51.641
to the kingdom of terror!

57:05.201 --> 57:06.681
Oh no, dear,

57:07.441 --> 57:10.401
it's not with me that you
will sate your hunger:

57:11.641 --> 57:15.641
save your fury for the last course!

57:19.241 --> 57:25.801
The time will come, and we will come back
to this “unfortunate misunderstanding”,

57:26.281 --> 57:28.361
and we will take measures.

57:28.521 --> 57:33.841
The brain must be able to trust its arm.

57:34.281 --> 57:35.361
Oh, yes.

57:45.681 --> 57:46.681
Do we enter from here?

57:46.961 --> 57:49.081
Wait. I will look for another entrance.

01:00:34.641 --> 01:00:35.921
My dear guests,

01:00:37.281 --> 01:00:38.761
welcome to you all,

01:00:40.201 --> 01:00:42.921
I am very sorry I have made you wait.

01:00:43.761 --> 01:00:47.361
Your patience will be suitably rewarded,

01:00:47.841 --> 01:00:49.201
let me assure you!

01:00:49.481 --> 01:00:53.121
I know how much you have
waited for this moment

01:00:53.281 --> 01:00:57.881
and I myself have been excited for days,
let me tell you.

01:01:00.001 --> 01:01:04.561
I think you can imagine that when one
organises meetings such as this one

01:01:04.721 --> 01:01:09.241
must be prepared for any
sort of unforeseen event.

01:01:10.961 --> 01:01:13.961
And it happened just a short time ago

01:01:14.121 --> 01:01:17.201
that two “unexpected guests”

01:01:18.081 --> 01:01:21.441
decided to take part in our banquet...

01:01:22.801 --> 01:01:25.561
And we had no hesitation

01:01:25.721 --> 01:01:28.001
in agreeing to their request!

01:01:28.841 --> 01:01:32.361
Let the party begin, ladies and gentlemen!

01:03:01.201 --> 01:03:02.761
Let's eat.

01:04:00.921 --> 01:04:02.961
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:04:03.121 --> 01:04:07.361
We didn't serve the lungs because
they are too difficult to digest,

01:04:08.041 --> 01:04:10.561
due to their very compact structure.

01:04:11.321 --> 01:04:14.761
The heart is nutritious and free of fat,

01:04:15.321 --> 01:04:16.641
such as the liver,

01:04:17.161 --> 01:04:21.521
but unfortunately one of the two
"guests" was a heavy drinker,

01:04:21.681 --> 01:04:25.121
and his liver was too
hard and not edible.

01:04:26.121 --> 01:04:26.761
The brain

01:04:27.241 --> 01:04:28.561
on the other hand

01:04:29.001 --> 01:04:31.401
is rich in cholesterol,

01:04:32.121 --> 01:04:33.681
and I do not recommend it,

01:04:33.841 --> 01:04:36.681
if you suffer from arteriosclerosis.

01:04:38.841 --> 01:04:41.361
That is the spleen:

01:04:42.121 --> 01:04:43.961
it is especially fine.

01:04:55.721 --> 01:04:56.961
My dear friends,

01:04:58.201 --> 01:05:04.121
I see with great joy that the specialities
of the house are to your satisfaction!

01:05:05.321 --> 01:05:07.681
What wonderful guests you are,

01:05:09.281 --> 01:05:12.441
you have not disappointed me at all!

01:05:13.161 --> 01:05:16.161
As I was saying to you a short time ago,

01:05:16.641 --> 01:05:22.841
we have decided to keep the
best till last, for the grand finale.

01:05:23.801 --> 01:05:26.681
I am sure that what I am going to tell you

01:05:27.201 --> 01:05:31.401
will act <i>as</i> a further stimulus
to your animal instincts

01:05:33.281 --> 01:05:35.241
and impulses,

01:05:36.281 --> 01:05:41.801
and you must not put up
any resistance my friends:

01:05:42.361 --> 01:05:46.161
do your worst in your depravity!

01:05:46.601 --> 01:05:53.721
This evening you will get the
opportunity to have a real taste of life!

01:05:54.441 --> 01:05:59.681
To feel a soul leaving its body,

01:06:00.961 --> 01:06:03.481
to have the power of death

01:06:03.881 --> 01:06:06.841
and pain in your hands!

01:06:08.481 --> 01:06:10.161
You will kill for me,

01:06:10.321 --> 01:06:11.681
all together:

01:06:11.841 --> 01:06:16.121
the banquet of blood is not over yet!

01:06:33.961 --> 01:06:37.521
What the fuck is that? Get
out of here. Get out of here..

01:06:37.841 --> 01:06:38.241
Oh fuck!

01:07:15.161 --> 01:07:17.241
Help...

01:07:22.161 --> 01:07:24.641
Bea, where are you?

01:07:29.321 --> 01:07:30.721
Where the fuck are you?

01:09:52.841 --> 01:09:53.361
Die.

01:09:54.281 --> 01:09:55.281
You fuck. Die.

01:11:52.321 --> 01:11:53.761
Thank you, Liliana.

01:11:54.361 --> 01:11:55.441
Our mutual friend,

01:11:57.121 --> 01:12:01.081
during his last “exhibition”
created one or two problems,

01:12:01.601 --> 01:12:04.081
that however couldn't be overlooked,

01:12:04.521 --> 01:12:07.401
so we had to terminate our collaboration.

01:12:07.601 --> 01:12:10.361
Of course professor, I understand.

01:12:11.121 --> 01:12:13.641
- What can I do for you now?
- Oh, it has been a...

01:12:14.601 --> 01:12:18.161
a long and fantastic night for everybody

01:12:18.921 --> 01:12:22.841
and I must confess that
the success of our party

01:12:23.001 --> 01:12:25.441
has been largely down to you, my dear.

01:12:25.601 --> 01:12:27.481
I'm very proud of you!

01:12:28.041 --> 01:12:33.441
It was all so perfect,
I can't ask any more of you.

01:12:34.081 --> 01:12:37.401
But I'm sure you feel
very tired and worn out,

01:12:37.961 --> 01:12:41.081
so come, let me take you to your room.

01:12:41.481 --> 01:12:45.481
I'm sure you can do
with a little...rest...

01:13:35.201 --> 01:13:36.441
<i>Black Heron, please.</i>

01:13:38.921 --> 01:13:39.441
Thank you.

01:13:39.841 --> 01:13:40.921
Good evening.
