00:29.821 --> 00:33.532
Man: Thirty years ago, my wife and l
purchased a liquor license.

00:33.700 --> 00:38.162
Then we had the liquor store up
and running by Christmas.

00:38.329 --> 00:41.999
We poured our heart and soul in it.
And then, lo and behold,

00:42.125 --> 00:44.960
l get a knock on my door
one night, l'm at the house,

00:45.128 --> 00:48.630
my wife's down at the liquor store
working, and it was Kevin Weeks

00:48.798 --> 00:52.801
and Whitey Bulger at the door,
and l didn't know,

00:52.969 --> 00:54.053
what the hell do they want?

00:56.056 --> 00:59.058
"You got a problem."
l said, "l don't... what problem?"

00:59.184 --> 01:02.311
He says, "Listen,
we were hired to kill you."

01:02.520 --> 01:04.229
l'm like, what?

01:04.355 --> 01:06.690
He said, you got to understand,
the other liquor stores,

01:06.858 --> 01:09.234
they hired us to kill you.

01:10.278 --> 01:12.613
l just couldn't believe it,
l didn't know what to even think,

01:12.822 --> 01:15.157
l was dumbfounded.
Actually, l froze.

01:15.408 --> 01:18.702
He said, "But what we're going to do
instead of that, we're just going to

01:18.828 --> 01:22.706
become your partners." l said, "No,
you're not becoming my partners."

01:22.874 --> 01:27.961
And then, Bulger's right there.
He's just staring at me,

01:28.129 --> 01:33.175
and just grinding his teeth like,
"You don't understand,

01:33.384 --> 01:35.052
we're taking
the fucking liquor store."

01:35.303 --> 01:38.055
l was like, "lt's not for sale."
He said, "l'll fucking kill you.

01:38.223 --> 01:42.893
l'll stab you, and then l'll kill you."
l'm like, Holy Jesus.

01:43.103 --> 01:47.314
And then they pulled out a gun.
l was like, "Oh, fuck."

01:49.150 --> 01:51.068
They picked up my kid.

01:51.236 --> 01:53.320
Daughter was a year.

01:53.488 --> 01:54.696
He said, "lt would be terrible

01:54.864 --> 01:59.368
for this kid to grow up without a father."
l was like... and l melted.

02:01.704 --> 02:02.704
Nothing you can do.

02:07.252 --> 02:09.461
Ever since that day,
l've never been the same.

02:09.628 --> 02:14.591
l couldn't protect my own children.
As a man, that just took me away.

02:14.759 --> 02:18.428
And l'm not over it yet.
l won't be over, and maybe l'll never

02:18.638 --> 02:21.640
get over it, but l surely can't wait
to get in front of that court,

02:21.766 --> 02:24.935
on that stand and testify
against that. 30 years ago,

02:25.145 --> 02:27.396
he scared me to death, he don't
scare me to death no more.

02:29.983 --> 02:33.235
Woman: After 16 years, the FBl
finally has its man.

02:33.319 --> 02:37.197
Boston mob boss James Whitey Bulger
was captured in Southern California.

02:37.365 --> 02:40.909
Man: ...along with his longtime girlfriend,
Catherine Elizabeth Greig.

02:41.077 --> 02:43.579
The 83-year-old
is accused of drug trafficking,

02:43.746 --> 02:47.541
extortion and murder, all while
working as an FBl informant.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.710
He was on the lam for 16 years.

02:51.629 --> 02:55.257
l never committed a crime in the
16 years that l was with Catherine.

02:55.466 --> 02:57.426
My whole life changed
when l was with her.

02:57.594 --> 03:02.389
l turned and become very,
very human, l guess you'd say it.

03:02.557 --> 03:06.852
And l love the woman intensely.
When l was captured, l told them,

03:07.020 --> 03:10.898
"lf you people," l says, "will let Catherine
go, l'll plead guilty to all crimes."

03:11.107 --> 03:14.818
"Any crime," l says, "innocent
or guilty. Youse can execute me,

03:15.028 --> 03:17.654
you can give me life sentence,
you can do whatever youse want,

03:17.906 --> 03:21.283
but l want her to be free."
And l meant it, and l mean it today.

03:21.492 --> 03:22.993
lf they said to me,
"Plead guilty, and we'll

03:23.203 --> 03:26.163
let her go free and shut your mouth,"
l would do it.

03:45.058 --> 03:48.894
Woman: lt's been a long time coming.
After 16 years on the lam

03:49.062 --> 03:53.398
and two years in custody,
the criminal trial of James Whitey Bulger

03:53.566 --> 03:57.319
began today at the John J. Moakley
courthouse in South Boston,

03:57.528 --> 04:00.656
just blocks away from
Whitey's former home turf.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.074
( sirens wailing )

04:02.242 --> 04:05.035
Man: This is what it looked like here
at the courthouse earlier this morning.

04:05.203 --> 04:08.580
A police escort and several black
SUVs roll up to federal court.

04:08.748 --> 04:11.667
Behind the tinted windows,
James Whitey Bulger,

04:11.834 --> 04:15.462
who is back in Boston to face
19 charges of murder

04:15.588 --> 04:19.675
in the same city he's accused
of terrorizing as a gang boss.

04:19.841 --> 04:22.052
Man 2: Some of the victims' families
also arriving today,

04:22.220 --> 04:25.847
hoping to see justice done
after waiting almost 30 years.

04:26.015 --> 04:28.308
l'm happy that this is about to start.
lt's been a long wait.

04:28.518 --> 04:31.853
A really, really long wait in time.
So, l'll see youse when l get out.

04:31.980 --> 04:34.064
How are you going to
feel being in there?

04:34.232 --> 04:36.817
l don't know.
Sick to my stomach now,

04:37.026 --> 04:39.611
l can only imagine
when l get in there.

04:39.737 --> 04:42.739
Woman: Prosecutors describe
James Whitey Bulger as the center

04:42.949 --> 04:45.867
of mayhem and murder in Boston
for 30 years,

04:46.119 --> 04:49.121
as the boss of Boston's
notorious Winter Hill Gang.

04:49.289 --> 04:52.291
A man so dangerous that he
joined Osama Bin Laden

04:52.417 --> 04:54.960
at the top of the FBl's
Most Wanted list.

04:55.169 --> 04:59.339
lt was the gang that ran amok. You
have people who were being extorted,

04:59.507 --> 05:02.759
who talked of having shotgun
barrels stuck in their mouths,

05:02.927 --> 05:05.679
of machine guns
pointed at their groin.

05:05.888 --> 05:09.891
Boeri: Body bags shown them
before Bulger shakes them down.

05:10.059 --> 05:12.394
lt was absolute terror.

05:12.603 --> 05:18.150
Back then, 70s, 80s, people
were missing every day, bang.

05:19.027 --> 05:21.236
He didn't come home,
he's a dead man.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.988
They're never going to find him.

05:23.156 --> 05:26.408
Brian Howell. Dead.
Michael Donahue. Dead.

05:26.576 --> 05:28.493
Bodies were being,
left and right.

05:28.661 --> 05:31.163
And were all involved

05:31.289 --> 05:36.543
in this circle of shit
in South Boston.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.839
Man: And you have a fascination
with Whitey Bulger

05:40.965 --> 05:46.261
as a Robin Hood figure, this elusive,
Houdini-like crime boss,

05:46.429 --> 05:49.139
whose younger brother, Bill Bulger,
was Senate President,

05:49.307 --> 05:51.725
the most powerful
politician in Massachusetts.

05:51.893 --> 05:54.561
All this stuff that was sort of
magical about him

05:54.729 --> 05:58.023
that made him seem
beyond the reach of law enforcement.

05:58.191 --> 06:02.152
Man: There were over 25 years
where James Bulger ruled

06:02.320 --> 06:04.738
the organized crime world.
He was never charged

06:04.989 --> 06:06.198
with even a misdemeanor.

06:06.449 --> 06:10.660
The Department of Justice
did nothing to prosecute him.

06:10.828 --> 06:13.997
Woman: Whitey was the guy
that got away. Whitey was the guy

06:14.248 --> 06:17.793
out in the wind, thumbing his nose,
"Ha-ha, l won," for years.

06:17.919 --> 06:21.296
So today is huge. l mean,
l think that, you know, what...

06:21.464 --> 06:26.927
There's so many people who never
thought this day would ever happen.

06:27.220 --> 06:31.223
Man: James Whitey Bulger fled Boston
in late 1994, as federal agents

06:31.391 --> 06:34.101
were about to arrest him
in connection with 19 killings,

06:34.268 --> 06:39.231
racketeering, and other crimes that
spanned the early 1970s to mid 1980s.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.983
Man 2: He fled after being
tipped off by an FBl agent.

06:42.151 --> 06:43.693
He was about to be indicted.

06:43.861 --> 06:47.155
Woman: Bulger's role as an FBl
informant is central to this trial.

06:47.323 --> 06:49.616
Man 3: Now he'll face justice
in the same city

06:49.784 --> 06:52.661
many say he ran with an iron fist.

07:08.928 --> 07:12.639
l'll be honest with you,
l have today's date, June 12th.

07:13.683 --> 07:15.350
But lately, l couldn't...

07:16.936 --> 07:19.312
The past few days,
l couldn't tell you what,

07:19.522 --> 07:22.274
and it's the God's truth,
l couldn't tell you

07:22.567 --> 07:27.070
if it was Sunday, Monday,
Friday. lt's... l was...

07:27.238 --> 07:29.030
Man: How come?

07:29.198 --> 07:33.994
My head's been so twisted over all this.
You know, it's like... surreal.

07:34.287 --> 07:37.414
You know, it's...
it's happening.

07:38.666 --> 07:44.337
Whitey killed my sister.
She was looked upon as a good person.

07:44.505 --> 07:49.801
She'd come in the room and she'd,
she'd light it up.

07:50.011 --> 07:53.513
"Hey." You know, "Everybody..."
You know, it's...

07:53.681 --> 07:56.433
He had no right to take her life.

07:59.270 --> 08:04.274
And he took her teeth out,
her hands, and...

08:09.906 --> 08:13.617
Woman: Mike was killed 30 years ago.

08:14.494 --> 08:19.456
But, you know, l think when you
lose somebody, there's no time.

08:19.749 --> 08:22.167
Sometimes it just seems
like yesterday.

08:22.335 --> 08:25.003
l don't think he should've
died when he died.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.380
He had too much to live for.

08:27.548 --> 08:30.425
You know, the day he was killed,
he was looking for my son Michael

08:30.551 --> 08:33.636
to take him with him.
But, he was down the park,

08:33.804 --> 08:35.013
and he couldn't find him.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.307
So l said, just, you know,
"Just go without him."

08:37.475 --> 08:43.313
Thank God, you know. l guess there's
a reason for everything, you know.

08:49.445 --> 08:51.029
Davis: Did you get a haircut?

08:52.406 --> 08:54.115
Get over here,
l want to introduce you.

08:54.283 --> 08:55.992
Look it, l didn't know l was
supposed to get all dressed up.

08:56.160 --> 08:58.161
- l just got a shirt on.
- Jesus Christ.

08:58.329 --> 09:00.580
- Today, l feel fantastic.
- Man: How come?

09:00.748 --> 09:03.416
Well, 30 years ago, they
tormented me, and it's been

09:03.584 --> 09:08.046
30 years of torment, and now it's
coming to an end.

09:08.297 --> 09:10.840
Thank God he's behind bars.

09:11.133 --> 09:14.678
My father always told me that good
will always triumph over evil.

09:14.929 --> 09:18.223
Even if it takes a long time.
And that's just what l'm here for.

09:18.432 --> 09:20.267
- We don't forget.
- Rakes: No.

09:20.434 --> 09:22.227
- No.
- You know what l mean?

09:24.230 --> 09:29.192
The only kind of comfort l get
through this is talking with him.

09:29.318 --> 09:31.278
You know, me and Steve
meet every morning,

09:31.445 --> 09:33.363
just about every morning for coffee.

09:33.531 --> 09:35.156
That's why Steve and l,
we have something in common,

09:35.366 --> 09:39.160
this psychotic individual.
We're going to bring justice,

09:39.328 --> 09:40.996
it has to be done.

09:41.163 --> 09:46.001
Finally payback.
As nervous as l am, exciting,

09:46.210 --> 09:50.547
the adrenaline is pumping, l just can't,
l can't believe l'm finally here.

09:50.715 --> 09:54.801
l finally get to stop.
l'll have my day, my time.

09:54.969 --> 09:56.678
Woman: Gentleman, let me ask you
just to say a few words

09:56.971 --> 09:58.805
as you're going in,
what your thoughts are.

09:59.015 --> 10:03.351
Anxious. The day has come.

10:03.519 --> 10:05.353
Man: What are you going to be
thinking as you look at him

10:05.521 --> 10:07.314
in that courtroom today?

10:07.481 --> 10:10.442
Well, you know, 30 years ago,
l'd never look at him.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.819
Now l can't wait to look him
right in the eyes.

10:12.987 --> 10:17.365
Reporter on radio: lt's day one of one of
the most anticipated trials in decades.

10:17.533 --> 10:19.784
Reporter 2: Cameras should've been
allowed in the courtroom.

10:19.952 --> 10:21.995
Obviously, in federal court,
they are not allowed.

10:22.163 --> 10:24.748
Female reporter: For the people of
Boston, this case is about justice.

10:24.957 --> 10:27.584
lt is about redemption,
it is about retribution.

10:27.835 --> 10:31.212
Opening statements in the trial
of James Whitey Bulger.

10:31.380 --> 10:33.340
Reporter 3: The Assistant US Attorney,
Brian Kelly, telling jurors.

10:33.507 --> 10:37.093
Kelly: "He did the dirty work himself,
because he was a hands-on killer

10:37.345 --> 10:40.263
who ran amok in the city of Boston
for almost 30 years.

10:40.431 --> 10:43.099
Bulger was deeply involved
in the distribution of drugs

10:43.267 --> 10:44.601
in the South Boston area.

10:44.727 --> 10:47.354
Bulger was one of the biggest
informants in Boston.

10:47.521 --> 10:50.440
Bulger routinely met
with FBl agent John Connolly

10:50.566 --> 10:53.443
and gave him information
to protect himself,

10:53.611 --> 10:55.987
or get the competitive edge
that he wanted."

10:56.155 --> 10:58.198
Reporter 3: He then showed the jury
pictures of each

10:58.366 --> 11:00.742
of the 19 people
investigators say Bulger killed.

11:00.910 --> 11:03.536
Woman: They described victims,
former friends, associates,

11:03.663 --> 11:06.831
girlfriends, all killed
and buried in secret graves.

11:06.999 --> 11:11.044
Some relatives in court listening
choked up when they heard that.

11:11.212 --> 11:13.213
Woman 2: The government,
ending its opening statements

11:13.381 --> 11:16.633
by slowly, dramatically,
reading off the names

11:16.926 --> 11:19.302
of the 19 alleged murder victims.

11:19.428 --> 11:23.765
Man: Bucky Barrett, Roger Wheeler,
Brian Halloran, Michael Donahue,

11:23.891 --> 11:27.852
John Callahan, Deborah Davis,
and Deborah Hussey.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.105
Kelly: This is not
a traditional murder case.

11:30.272 --> 11:33.191
lt's a racketeering charge.
And within the racketeering charge,

11:33.359 --> 11:36.069
there are multiple predicate crimes
that we have to prove.

11:36.195 --> 11:40.240
We have to prove at least two of them.
And Bulger is charged with 33

11:40.408 --> 11:43.827
separate predicate crimes.
19 separate murders,

11:43.994 --> 11:46.955
multiple extortions,
drug dealing, gambling.

11:47.123 --> 11:48.957
And of those,
we have to prove at least two

11:49.125 --> 11:50.750
beyond a reasonable doubt,
and we have to prove

11:50.918 --> 11:53.211
that Bulger was part of
this criminal enterprise

11:53.379 --> 11:57.465
that was committing
all these crimes for 30 years.

11:57.633 --> 12:00.510
Man: Defense attorney J.W. Carney
stunned the courtroom, admitting

12:00.678 --> 12:04.222
for the first time that Bulger was
involved in drug trafficking.

12:04.390 --> 12:07.892
Carney: James Bulger was involved
in drug dealing. He was involved in

12:08.060 --> 12:11.479
bookmaking, loan sharking.
These crimes are what he did.

12:11.647 --> 12:13.898
Man: But he poked holes
in government witnesses.

12:14.066 --> 12:16.359
Woman: Carney tried to paint
a picture of Bulger associates

12:16.527 --> 12:19.779
turned government witnesses,
John Martorano, Kevin Weeks,

12:19.905 --> 12:22.574
and Steven Flemmi
as the real murderers

12:22.742 --> 12:24.951
who just pinned their crimes
on his client.

12:25.119 --> 12:29.205
Boeri: The defense said, all those three
witnesses' testimony was purchased.

12:29.373 --> 12:31.374
They were murderous thugs
whose testimony

12:31.542 --> 12:33.960
was purchased by sparing them
the death penalty,

12:34.170 --> 12:37.672
cutting their prison sentence,
and offering them all sorts of incentives.

12:37.840 --> 12:40.884
Given these three individuals,
given their backgrounds,

12:41.135 --> 12:45.680
given their character, would you believe
them beyond a reasonable doubt?

12:46.015 --> 12:48.183
Woman: Carney denied
that Bulger was an informant.

12:48.350 --> 12:51.519
The evidence will show
that he was never an informant

12:51.645 --> 12:56.065
for John Connolly and the FBl.
You will learn the depth of corruption

12:56.275 --> 12:59.736
in federal law enforcement that
existed during this period.

12:59.862 --> 13:04.949
This was how James Bulger was able
to never, ever be charged.

13:10.122 --> 13:13.833
Boeri: What makes this trial
extraordinary, and really crazy,

13:14.001 --> 13:16.795
the defense is defending him
from an assertion that he was

13:16.962 --> 13:20.799
an informant, even though it's not
a charge. And so what seems crazy

13:20.966 --> 13:23.426
is the government has
gotten sucked into this as well,

13:23.594 --> 13:26.679
they're trying to prove that he is,
even though it's totally irrelevant

13:26.847 --> 13:28.014
to his guilt or innocence.

13:28.182 --> 13:32.852
So it's not about guilt or innocence,
it's about his legacy,

13:33.020 --> 13:36.648
of wanting to establish he wasn't
a tout, a rat, an informant,

13:36.816 --> 13:38.274
whatever you want to call it.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.735
( sirens wailing )

13:42.947 --> 13:47.867
Carney: l was as surprised as anyone
when James Whitey Bulger was captured.

13:48.035 --> 13:51.412
ls the government excited about
having Bulger come back?

13:51.580 --> 13:55.875
Some people certainly are.
But there are others, l think,

13:56.043 --> 13:58.002
who have many sleepless nights

13:58.170 --> 14:00.880
about what James Bulger
is going to testify to.

14:02.007 --> 14:05.468
l believe the reason that they are
giving so much protection to Bulger

14:05.636 --> 14:08.304
to transport him from the jail
to the courthouse,

14:08.472 --> 14:11.266
is they are worried about
someone with a sniper rifle

14:11.433 --> 14:15.645
taking him out on the way to court
so that he can't testify.

14:15.813 --> 14:19.732
That's how explosive
his testimony will be.

14:29.368 --> 14:31.953
Man: This is Whitey's world.

14:32.121 --> 14:35.123
You go from Squantum,
where he lived with Cathy...

14:35.291 --> 14:41.254
lt's basically six miles, if you drive
it, up to Castle lsland over there.

14:41.422 --> 14:43.965
That's Southie, where
he did most of his crime.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.342
He murdered people there.
He buried people there.

14:46.510 --> 14:49.637
And he went to sleep there.
So, that's his world.

14:51.223 --> 14:54.434
Man 2: l spent much of my childhood
in South Boston,

14:54.560 --> 14:58.938
and even as a kid, l knew
Whitey Bulger ran the show here.

14:59.106 --> 15:01.149
But Whitey was very lucky.

15:01.317 --> 15:03.693
ln the 1960s, there was
an lrish gang war.

15:03.861 --> 15:06.321
And over 60 people were killed.

15:06.488 --> 15:09.324
But Whitey was in prison.
So he missed all that.

15:09.408 --> 15:11.117
He would've had
a high, high chance

15:11.327 --> 15:15.121
of being a victim of that violence.

15:15.331 --> 15:16.623
When he got out of prison,

15:16.790 --> 15:20.585
Whitey went to Howie Winter, who was
the leader of the Winter Hill Gang,

15:20.753 --> 15:25.632
preeminent non-Mafia gang
in this region. And he said to Howie,

15:25.799 --> 15:28.176
"We got to stop the war in Southie,
too many people are dying,

15:28.469 --> 15:31.846
we're losing money."
Howie was very impressed by Whitey.

15:32.014 --> 15:34.057
And one of the things
that impressed him most

15:34.308 --> 15:36.392
was that Whitey had done time
in Alcatraz.

15:36.560 --> 15:40.396
Now, you know, for you and me,
you know, we like to hand in our resume

15:40.564 --> 15:43.942
and say, "See, l went to Stanford,
l got my MBA at Wharton."

15:44.151 --> 15:47.612
But in that milieu, if you're a wise guy,
you say, "Oh, you went to Alcatraz."

15:47.821 --> 15:50.657
And Howie said
that Whitey came across

15:50.824 --> 15:52.867
as a guy that could be a leader.

15:53.035 --> 15:57.038
So Howie mediates the end
of the war with a rival gang

15:57.247 --> 16:00.166
in South Boston called the Mullens,
in which the Mullens

16:00.292 --> 16:03.294
actually were about to prevail.
And the Mullen's guys think,

16:03.462 --> 16:06.214
you know, they're about to
get the lion's share of everything.

16:06.340 --> 16:10.969
And Howie threw them for a loop,
when he announced that Jimmy Bulger,

16:11.136 --> 16:13.763
he's going to front money for them,
they can put money on the street,

16:14.014 --> 16:17.225
loan shark,
they can do a gambling operation,

16:17.393 --> 16:18.768
but Whitey's going to be in charge.

16:18.936 --> 16:21.270
And the Mullen's guys were going,
"What, are you kidding me?

16:21.438 --> 16:22.438
We were winning."

16:22.606 --> 16:25.650
And Tommy King, who was
a member of the Mullens said,

16:25.776 --> 16:28.194
"We should have killed Whitey
when we had a chance,

16:28.362 --> 16:30.071
because this is going to
come back to bite us."

16:36.495 --> 16:39.539
Man: Southie was great growing up.
Everybody knew everyone.

16:39.707 --> 16:42.083
Everyone watched out for everybody.
lt was great.

16:42.292 --> 16:45.545
You know, we didn't have a lot, but
we had a lot of fun with what we had.

16:45.713 --> 16:47.964
My brothers both went to
college, they went to Harvard,

16:48.132 --> 16:50.508
so l was the only male at home.
l knew how to fight,

16:50.718 --> 16:53.886
and l was kind of handy, so l started
working different bars, bouncing,

16:54.096 --> 16:55.763
and l ended up at Triple O's.

16:56.974 --> 16:59.308
lt was a neighborhood bar.
lt was kind of a rough bar,

16:59.518 --> 17:02.353
and that's where l met Jim Bulger
and Steve Flemmi.

17:02.521 --> 17:04.021
l was 18 at the time.

17:04.897 --> 17:06.898
Jim was like an older brother,

17:07.026 --> 17:09.193
he was guiding me through
a minefield and stuff,

17:09.361 --> 17:11.738
and teaching me a lot as l went.

17:11.905 --> 17:15.532
When l first started working with them,
they started out small, you know,

17:15.701 --> 17:19.619
and just, you know, beating people up,
and little by little, take baby steps.

17:19.788 --> 17:22.415
You know, from gambling,
loan sharking, you know,

17:22.583 --> 17:26.169
to extortion and stuff, and doing
extortions with Jim Bulger and stuff,

17:26.336 --> 17:28.755
and l was making a lot of money.

17:28.964 --> 17:31.883
But the moment
that everything changed for me,

17:32.051 --> 17:34.635
the moment my life changed, was when
l was involved in the first murder.

17:34.803 --> 17:35.803
lt was a double homicide.

17:35.971 --> 17:38.848
So then l knew l was in,
and there was no getting out.

17:39.016 --> 17:42.351
So l decided, "Well, if l'm going to
do this, l'm going to do it right.

17:42.519 --> 17:44.353
l'm going to be the best at it
that l can."

17:44.563 --> 17:46.397
( sirens wailing )

17:48.817 --> 17:52.195
Woman: lt was tense in court Tuesday
between James Whitey Bulger

17:52.362 --> 17:55.615
and the man who was once like a son
to him, his former right-hand man,

17:55.783 --> 17:58.201
turned cooperating
government witness, Kevin Weeks.

17:58.368 --> 18:01.204
Woman 2: Weeks was one of
the government's star eyewitnesses.

18:01.371 --> 18:04.707
As Bulger's mob enforcer, Kevin Weeks
says he buried the bodies,

18:04.875 --> 18:08.377
moved the guns, and collected
the cash which bookmakers

18:08.504 --> 18:10.838
and businessmen paid
to stay in business.

18:11.006 --> 18:14.550
Woman: Weeks calmly and coldly
testified he watched James Bulger

18:14.718 --> 18:19.305
brutally murder Deborah Hussey, John
Mclntyre, and Arthur "Bucky" Barrett.

18:19.473 --> 18:21.516
Weeks: Jim Bulger stepped out with
a machine gun, was put in a chair,

18:21.683 --> 18:24.060
tied with chains.
As he walked down the stairs,

18:24.228 --> 18:25.728
Jim Bulger shot him
in the back of the head.

18:25.896 --> 18:27.355
He was strangled,
he was just gagging...

18:27.564 --> 18:29.482
Jim Bulger asked him
if he wanted one in the head,

18:29.650 --> 18:31.943
and the kid said, "Yes, please,"
and shot him in the head.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.403
There Jim had her,
strangled around the neck,

18:34.530 --> 18:36.697
he's got his legs wrapped around her,
her lips turned blue, face,

18:36.824 --> 18:38.241
the eyes rolled up in the head
and everything.

18:38.408 --> 18:39.909
Steve Flemmi says, "She's not dead."

18:40.077 --> 18:42.495
He wraps a cord around
her neck and starts twisting.

18:42.663 --> 18:45.957
Teeth were pulled, and she's
buried in the basement floor.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.875
Woman: As the defense
began cross-examining

18:48.001 --> 18:50.628
the former Bulger protÃ©gÃ©,
Weeks looked annoyed.

18:50.796 --> 18:53.548
Carmey: So when you told me
a moment ago that you never lied

18:53.674 --> 18:55.758
to the investigators, that was a lie.

18:55.926 --> 18:57.593
l've been lying my whole life,
l'm a criminal.

18:57.761 --> 18:59.595
Woman: The tension
reached a boiling point,

18:59.763 --> 19:01.889
when defense attorney Jay Carney
asked Weeks:

19:02.057 --> 19:04.809
Carney: You were concerned
that you would be viewed as a rat.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.644
No one calls you a rat?

19:06.812 --> 19:09.063
Weeks: No one says it to my face.
No one's ever said it to me.

19:09.231 --> 19:10.481
You know, maybe behind my back.

19:10.649 --> 19:12.817
Carney: What would you do
if they said it to you?

19:12.985 --> 19:14.986
"We'll go outside, just the
two of us, you say it to my face

19:15.154 --> 19:16.696
and see what l do to you."

19:16.864 --> 19:18.197
And he looked at me,
he goes, "Physical?"

19:18.365 --> 19:21.409
And l says, "Yeah, l'll hurt you."
You know, l mean he asked a question

19:21.535 --> 19:23.327
l gave him an honest answer.

19:23.495 --> 19:26.581
Woman: But the best was yet to come
as Carney asked how the killings

19:26.790 --> 19:29.500
bother Weeks.
The court transcript reads,

19:29.710 --> 19:33.045
"Because we killed people that
were rats, and l had the biggest rat

19:33.213 --> 19:36.132
right next to me."
Bulger then said, "You suck."

19:36.300 --> 19:39.218
Weeks fired back,
"(Expletive) you, okay."

19:39.428 --> 19:43.264
Bulger gets in the last shot.
"(Expletive) you, too."

19:52.816 --> 19:56.944
Man: This is where Whitey used to take
his walks and he would meet with people.

19:57.112 --> 19:58.529
They stayed on the street
for quite a while,

19:58.655 --> 20:03.910
and that never should've happened.
lt's just... lt's crazy, it's crazy.

20:05.621 --> 20:08.456
Long: l worked organized crime
most of my career.

20:08.665 --> 20:12.251
So l saw Bulger going up the chain
with the Winter Hill Gang.

20:12.419 --> 20:15.880
Bulger and Flemmi
moved up in control.

20:17.758 --> 20:20.551
And in 1980, a young trooper
working for me

20:20.719 --> 20:24.347
was assigned to go down and check out
this garage down in the North End,

20:24.514 --> 20:26.474
to see about a possible
stolen car ring.

20:26.642 --> 20:29.894
When he went by, he noticed a lot of
organized crime figures there.

20:30.062 --> 20:33.272
He called me, l went down,
observed for myself,

20:33.440 --> 20:35.608
and that's when we started
this investigation.

20:35.776 --> 20:39.528
The garage was right up here,
just a little after the truck here.

20:42.115 --> 20:44.408
We commandeered an apartment
across the street,

20:44.576 --> 20:48.162
and we monitored it for
about four months, every day.

20:48.288 --> 20:53.251
And there we saw
James Bulger and Stephen Flemmi.

20:53.418 --> 20:57.046
Anybody who is anybody in
organized crime in New England,

20:57.256 --> 20:58.756
came here to this garage.

20:58.924 --> 21:01.759
People who were paying rent,
protection money,

21:01.927 --> 21:05.054
people who were in the shit,
let's say.

21:05.264 --> 21:09.016
They were meeting daily with
the leaders of the New England Mafia.

21:09.184 --> 21:12.186
The Angiulo crime family,
Patriarca crime family.

21:12.354 --> 21:14.605
And it was unprecedented to see that.

21:14.773 --> 21:16.607
lt was absolutely shocking

21:16.775 --> 21:19.443
to see that they were
actually working together.

21:19.695 --> 21:22.321
That was like striking gold.

21:22.489 --> 21:25.491
What surprised me, l'd say,
"Where's the Boston police?

21:25.659 --> 21:29.412
Where's the FBl? Why isn't
anybody else doing this?"

21:29.579 --> 21:32.123
They're right here.
They're operating so openly.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.958
lt just was shocking.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.419
And we monitored that,
and documented it,

21:36.670 --> 21:39.463
and we've got enough probable cause
to go to a judge

21:39.715 --> 21:44.593
and issue a warrant so that we can
place listening devices inside.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.846
And we planted the bug,
it worked great.

21:47.014 --> 21:49.223
Everything was fine.
The next morning,

21:49.391 --> 21:52.310
one of the first conversations we
picked up was what a great job

21:52.477 --> 21:55.271
the state police
on the Mass turnpike do.

21:55.397 --> 21:58.316
So, we knew the gig was up
right then and there.

21:59.568 --> 22:03.988
Somebody was protecting them.
We knew we were had,

22:04.156 --> 22:09.577
and we just couldn't figure out how.
Then one night, John Morris of the FBl

22:09.745 --> 22:13.205
met a Boston detective
at a bachelor party.

22:13.415 --> 22:15.666
And he was in a drunken state

22:15.834 --> 22:19.462
and told the Boston detective
that, "l know you guys

22:19.588 --> 22:21.297
are working with the state on a wire,

22:21.423 --> 22:25.634
on a bug down on Lancaster Street.
And the bad guys know about it."

22:25.844 --> 22:27.303
l couldn't believe it.

22:27.471 --> 22:30.264
How does anybody know
outside of our group?

22:30.432 --> 22:32.433
lt didn't make sense.

22:36.605 --> 22:39.648
Man: James Whitey Bulger's
relationship with the FBl

22:39.775 --> 22:42.360
will be the focus of testimony
this morning.

22:42.569 --> 22:47.114
Former FBl supervisor John Morris
is expected to take the stand.

22:47.240 --> 22:50.910
He was head of the FBl's organized
crime squad during the 70s and 80s,

22:51.078 --> 22:54.038
overseeing former agent,
John Connolly.

22:54.206 --> 22:57.416
Man 2: Morris claims that he and
John Connolly shielded James Bulger

22:57.584 --> 23:00.795
from prosecution.
ln addition to hearing Morris

23:00.962 --> 23:04.006
on the stand today,
federal prosecutors plan to discuss

23:04.174 --> 23:08.928
James Bulger's alleged
700 page FBl informant file.

23:11.807 --> 23:16.310
Man 3: To understand the Bulger story,
you really have to understand

23:16.478 --> 23:20.981
how the FBl and top echelon
informant program came into being

23:21.274 --> 23:24.318
to destroy the ltalian Mafia.

23:24.444 --> 23:29.698
lt really begins before the program
even existed when Joe Velachi testified

23:29.950 --> 23:34.203
before a Congressional committee
in 1963.

23:34.413 --> 23:38.374
And this testimony was engineered
by Robert Kennedy,

23:38.625 --> 23:41.627
Atty. Gen. Robert Kennedy,
and it was really explosive.

23:42.879 --> 23:44.922
Velachi came forward
and he described

23:45.132 --> 23:48.717
the hierarchy of the five families
in New York,

23:48.927 --> 23:51.929
and he described
the initiation ceremony.

23:52.097 --> 23:54.723
Man: What is the name
of this organization?

23:54.891 --> 23:57.226
"Cosa nostra," in ltalian.

23:57.394 --> 23:59.728
Man: "Cosa nostra" in ltalian.

23:59.896 --> 24:05.151
"Our thing"...and "our family,"
in English.

24:05.318 --> 24:09.280
English: The first time one of these
Mafia guys was talking

24:09.406 --> 24:12.658
into a television camera,
and it was a big deal,

24:12.826 --> 24:15.828
and it stole Hoover's thunder.
Because Hoover had,

24:15.954 --> 24:19.582
for decades now, been denying
that there was a Mafia.

24:19.749 --> 24:23.669
Now Hoover had a problem.
He needed to make up for lost time.

24:23.795 --> 24:26.172
And he needed to go out
and get informants

24:26.339 --> 24:29.508
as dramatic and as explosive
as Joe Velachi.

24:29.759 --> 24:32.011
We should all be concerned
with one goal:

24:32.262 --> 24:35.723
the eradication of crime.
The Federal Bureau of lnvestigation

24:35.891 --> 24:38.893
is as close to you
as your nearest telephone.

24:39.102 --> 24:42.313
lt seeks to be your protector in
all matters within its jurisdiction.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.315
lt belongs to you.

24:44.483 --> 24:49.069
English: The top echelon informant
program also was what gave power

24:49.237 --> 24:50.821
to guys like John Connolly.

24:50.989 --> 24:54.074
Because how are you going to
get guys like Velachi?

24:54.284 --> 24:56.535
Well, you're going to need FBl guys
who walk the walk

24:56.745 --> 24:59.663
and talk the talk,
who can go out into that underworld

24:59.831 --> 25:02.625
and sort of make deals
with these guys.

25:02.834 --> 25:05.544
So the power and influence
of the swaggering agent

25:05.795 --> 25:07.588
within the hierarchy went way up.

25:09.424 --> 25:13.886
Man: The general topic of our
discussion today is informant handling.

25:14.012 --> 25:18.807
And with me today is John Connolly,
a 15-year veteran of the FBl.

25:18.892 --> 25:23.187
How do you go about developing
individuals for recruitment,

25:23.396 --> 25:26.023
or targeting as an informant
for the Bureau?

25:26.191 --> 25:29.735
ln the case of
organized crime type people,

25:29.903 --> 25:32.696
you probably wouldn't want
to target a boss, for instance.

25:32.864 --> 25:39.370
You'd want someone perhaps close
to the level of criminal activity,

25:39.538 --> 25:42.706
but not necessarily involved.

25:42.874 --> 25:46.335
Lehr: When John Connolly was a boy,
he lived in Southie,

25:46.503 --> 25:50.464
in the same housing project with the
Bulgers. And he was in awe of Whitey,

25:50.632 --> 25:53.342
who was a teenage thug
with the platinum striking hair,

25:53.510 --> 25:57.221
and the amazing Hollywood good looks.
So John Connolly, given his history

25:57.472 --> 26:00.683
as a son of Southie,
his connection to the Bulger family,

26:00.850 --> 26:04.645
he succeeded in forging
what has since been called

26:04.813 --> 26:07.773
an unholy alliance
with Whitey Bulger.

26:07.941 --> 26:11.235
Remember, these are our most
important assets that we have,

26:11.403 --> 26:13.904
informants.
l mean, they're the name of the game.

26:14.155 --> 26:16.240
You're going to get friendly with them,
and you're going to like them.

26:16.408 --> 26:20.411
But you never can forget
who you work for.

26:30.005 --> 26:31.755
( phone ringing )

26:35.260 --> 26:36.302
Carney: Hello.

26:36.469 --> 26:37.803
Woman: Hi, Mr. Bulger's on the phone.

26:37.971 --> 26:39.346
Carney: All right,
please put him through.

26:39.514 --> 26:40.681
Woman: Sure.

26:40.849 --> 26:43.267
Thanks for calling. There
were a couple of things l wanted

26:43.435 --> 26:45.728
- to ask you about.
- Bulger: Sure.

26:45.854 --> 26:51.817
The first is, that you've told me
since the very first day l met you,

26:51.943 --> 26:53.986
that you've never been an informant.

26:54.154 --> 26:55.070
Bulger: That's correct.

26:55.196 --> 26:58.240
Carney: Does that mean you've never
been an informant in your entire life?

26:58.408 --> 27:02.494
Bulger: Never. As a teenager, l took
many a beating at the police stations,

27:02.746 --> 27:07.124
and l never cracked.
As a bank robber, l was captured,

27:07.292 --> 27:10.461
l pled guilty to free the girlfriend
that l was with,

27:10.629 --> 27:13.797
and l got a 20 year prison sentence,
first offender.

27:13.965 --> 27:19.303
ln prison, l was part of
an escape plot. The plot fell apart,

27:19.554 --> 27:22.431
one of the guys gave my name.
l told them, l don't know

27:22.599 --> 27:27.102
what you're talking about. l spent months
in the hole, naked and the whole thing.

27:27.270 --> 27:29.521
l went through a lot there.
And after four months,

27:29.689 --> 27:32.941
for punishment they sent me
to Alcatraz. And that was it.

27:33.109 --> 27:38.405
l never, never, never cracked.
And the Boston FBl, no way.

27:38.573 --> 27:42.660
l met John Connolly, who's a
salty guy, lrish Catholic like myself.

27:42.827 --> 27:46.872
You know, friendship, "lf l ever
hear anything, l'll tip you off,

27:47.040 --> 27:49.958
l'll give you a heads up."
And then l told him, "All right, John."

27:50.126 --> 27:53.128
l says, "l'll see you. lf you can
let me know, l'd appreciate it."

27:53.380 --> 27:54.922
And that's how it got started.

27:56.633 --> 28:00.052
Carney: This isn't really
a typical criminal trial.

28:00.428 --> 28:04.390
James Bulger knows
that by following the strategy

28:04.516 --> 28:07.226
he has directed us to do,

28:07.435 --> 28:10.521
he will be found guilty,
and he's gonna die

28:10.730 --> 28:12.731
behind the walls of a prison.

28:13.066 --> 28:17.027
But for Jim it doesn't matter,
he's at the end of his life.

28:17.195 --> 28:19.488
He doesn't know if he'll live
till the end of the trial,

28:19.656 --> 28:21.657
never mind till
the end of the year.

28:21.825 --> 28:27.705
But for him it's like, it's his last
opportunity to tell people

28:27.872 --> 28:32.251
that he was never an informant,
that our federal government

28:32.460 --> 28:37.381
is more corrupt in law enforcement
than anyone ever imagined,

28:37.549 --> 28:41.969
even to this day in this trial,
it's corrupt,

28:42.137 --> 28:44.513
and he wants people to know it.

28:44.764 --> 28:46.932
There's a lot of things
that we need to dispel.

28:47.100 --> 28:50.644
The fact that Jim wasn't an informant.
l mean, the local thinking

28:50.854 --> 28:53.439
is that absolutely he was an informant.
Everybody talks about it,

28:53.606 --> 28:54.940
books are written about it.

28:55.150 --> 28:56.817
Until you actually
go through everything

28:56.985 --> 29:00.112
and look at it to make your own
independent assessment,

29:00.280 --> 29:03.574
you can't have an opinion.
So getting involved in this case,

29:03.825 --> 29:06.577
l had an opportunity that l don't
think anybody in the public does,

29:06.745 --> 29:10.205
is l get to see the files
that the government had

29:10.457 --> 29:13.834
to suggest that he was an informant.
l thought that there were some things

29:14.043 --> 29:16.003
about the file
that were so suspicious,

29:16.129 --> 29:19.757
that l wanted to look into it in depth.
And so l sat down with Daryl,

29:19.924 --> 29:22.217
and l asked her to come up with
an independent assessment,

29:22.385 --> 29:24.762
whether or not she thought there
was any legitimacy to the files.

29:24.929 --> 29:27.473
Of course l was eager to start
the project and see what l could find,

29:27.640 --> 29:30.768
but l was also a bit skeptical.
l mean, just looking at the file

29:30.935 --> 29:32.603
when it was handed to me,
l thought, how could that

29:32.729 --> 29:35.939
possibly be fictitious?
lt's 700 pages and it looks

29:36.065 --> 29:39.276
very official, so it seems like
it had to be solid.

29:39.486 --> 29:44.072
But slowly, l found a lot of
strange repetition in the file.

29:44.240 --> 29:48.368
What l've done is created tabs
on every page where l found

29:48.578 --> 29:51.872
alternate sources for the information.
And we learned that John Connolly

29:52.081 --> 29:56.001
was pilfering through files.
And Connolly took specific information

29:56.169 --> 29:58.670
from these sources,
and placed it into Mr. Bulger's file.

29:58.880 --> 30:00.672
These alternate sources
comes from wiretaps,

30:00.840 --> 30:04.468
it comes from phone calls,
news articles, public information,

30:04.677 --> 30:07.513
FBl memorandums.
And the majority of the information

30:07.680 --> 30:10.474
comes from other informant files.
A top echelon file

30:10.683 --> 30:13.977
is supposed to be filled
with singular, unique information

30:14.145 --> 30:17.105
that can lead to a prosecution.
And just based on the patterns

30:17.273 --> 30:20.150
that l found looking at
other alternate sources,

30:20.318 --> 30:23.904
it's just not consistent with someone
who was providing unique information.

30:24.072 --> 30:28.450
Like this first page of his file,
from May 29, 1981 .

30:29.994 --> 30:33.956
The tip reads that "1544 advised
that the Mafia whacked out a guy

30:34.123 --> 30:36.542
several weeks ago...
He's in the trunk of a car."

30:36.709 --> 30:38.752
lt doesn't tell
who whacked out the guy,

30:38.920 --> 30:40.295
it doesn't tell what guy
was whacked out,

30:40.463 --> 30:42.881
it doesn't tell where the car is,
there's no substantive information

30:43.132 --> 30:46.093
in that, and there's no follow-up
in the entire file.

30:46.261 --> 30:50.848
You turn, it's actually the last page,
June 8 of that same year,

30:51.015 --> 30:55.018
the same exact tip shows up.
"1544 advised that source heard

30:55.186 --> 30:57.521
that the outfit people whacked out
a guy several weeks ago

30:57.689 --> 31:01.400
and left the individual in the trunk."
lt's vague, there's no details,

31:01.651 --> 31:03.402
and it shows up twice in his file.

31:05.321 --> 31:11.201
This is not unusual to see reports
in one informant's file

31:11.369 --> 31:14.746
that's similar to reports
in another informant's file.

31:14.914 --> 31:20.002
lf a crime occurs, a law-enforcement
agency surveys their informants.

31:20.169 --> 31:23.964
They get multiple reports
from various informants

31:24.132 --> 31:25.507
about the same criminal activity.

31:25.675 --> 31:29.761
That's exactly what Connolly
was doing with Bulger.

31:29.929 --> 31:33.265
The federal government
is so desperate in this trial

31:33.474 --> 31:36.226
to try to convince people
that he's an informant.

31:36.436 --> 31:41.773
Because James Bulger had such
a strong and influential reputation,

31:41.941 --> 31:46.028
his name had value as a commodity
for the Department of Justice.

31:46.195 --> 31:49.698
They needed search warrants
to take down the Mafia.

31:49.866 --> 31:52.993
They needed to put something
down to justify intrusions

31:53.161 --> 31:54.828
into people's civil liberties.

31:55.038 --> 31:58.040
Nobody was going to look and see
if the information was verified.

31:58.166 --> 32:01.084
No one was going to determine
whether it was made up by a street agent.

32:01.210 --> 32:03.253
No one was going to determine
whether it was true or not.

32:03.504 --> 32:06.423
lt wasn't enough simply for a magistrate
to sign off on probable cause.

32:06.591 --> 32:09.801
And there is example after example
in this case

32:10.011 --> 32:14.181
of where they took James Bulger's
name and used it as a commodity.

32:14.974 --> 32:19.811
lt's a preposterous assertion that he
was not an FBl informant.

32:20.021 --> 32:24.608
ln fact, he used the FBl,
and they used him.

32:24.776 --> 32:29.780
What this is all about,
quite frankly, is he doesn't mind

32:29.948 --> 32:32.783
being called a murderer,
he doesn't mind being called

32:32.951 --> 32:36.495
a criminal, obviously he doesn't mind
being called a drug dealer,

32:36.663 --> 32:38.705
but he doesn't want to be called
an informant.

32:38.915 --> 32:43.502
Because where he came from in Southie,
that's the worst thing you can be.

32:43.670 --> 32:46.004
You can be a crook,
you can be a murderer,

32:46.214 --> 32:50.258
but it's worse to be an informant.
That's the way he's brought up,

32:50.426 --> 32:55.055
in his sick mind,
that's what he believes.

32:55.640 --> 32:59.351
The fact that the file
is 700 pages, quite frankly,

32:59.560 --> 33:05.190
that's a large file. Bulger had
this relationship for 15 or 20 years.

33:08.152 --> 33:11.822
When they were saying that
he had a voluminous FBl file,

33:12.073 --> 33:14.616
how long were they claiming
that he was an FBl informant?

33:15.994 --> 33:17.119
Almost 20 years.

33:17.286 --> 33:19.955
Okay.
Well, l have extensive experience

33:20.164 --> 33:21.832
with a lot of informant files,

33:22.000 --> 33:27.629
and a top echelon informant file
is never going to be 700 pages.

33:27.839 --> 33:30.382
What should, generally,
the size of the file be?

33:30.550 --> 33:32.551
For 20 years?

33:32.844 --> 33:37.889
Anywhere from 60,000,

33:37.974 --> 33:43.145
55,000, up to,
you know, 300,000.

33:44.230 --> 33:46.565
The problem with the top echelon
informant program,

33:46.733 --> 33:49.067
it's not unique to the Bulger case,

33:49.235 --> 33:51.319
and a lot of people are dying
because of it.

33:51.446 --> 33:55.782
So l file a Freedom of lnformation Act
lawsuit against the government,

33:55.992 --> 33:57.993
and l won massive files,

33:58.202 --> 34:01.747
55,000 pages of files just on
one top echelon informant,

34:01.914 --> 34:05.959
Gregory Scarpa, a high level
informant for the FBl in New York.

34:06.127 --> 34:09.629
His main role was to
bring down the Colombo crime family.

34:09.797 --> 34:12.591
But at the same time,
he was lying and killing off

34:12.759 --> 34:16.053
his rivals and committing murders,
a lot of murders.

34:16.219 --> 34:18.429
ln trial, they said
more than 50 people.

34:20.016 --> 34:22.768
l don't know if you've ever seen
a real informant file or not.

34:22.976 --> 34:25.520
- l haven't. That looks heavy.
- Because l don't think that you have.

34:25.646 --> 34:28.190
See, you didn't have this
on yours, correct?

34:28.357 --> 34:32.277
These are important, these are
showing who these went to

34:32.487 --> 34:33.820
and who authorized these.

34:33.946 --> 34:35.614
That's an unbelievable
amount of signatures.

34:35.739 --> 34:36.697
Exactly.

34:36.824 --> 34:38.949
That means everybody here
saw this or endorsed it.

34:39.118 --> 34:43.246
Yeah, exactly.
And, but look how high it went up.

34:43.331 --> 34:46.333
Kelly, Deloach, that's up there,
that's up there with,

34:46.501 --> 34:48.335
with Hoover.

34:48.460 --> 34:52.089
And then it should go into
the information that he provided.

34:52.255 --> 34:57.219
He's given information, and then
the FBl does their own summary.

34:57.386 --> 35:00.055
Here. "This informant has not
furnished any information

35:00.139 --> 35:02.891
known to be false."
Do you have any of that on yours?

35:03.017 --> 35:04.309
We don't have things like that.

35:04.477 --> 35:08.688
And this is a total of 1147 pages.

35:08.856 --> 35:11.149
So, and that's just the first set.

35:11.400 --> 35:14.402
Now, l have an additional 55 coming,

35:14.612 --> 35:16.238
55,000 coming.

35:17.907 --> 35:21.743
Remember the day when Hank and l
were with you, and showed you

35:21.953 --> 35:25.997
the so-called informant file
that John Connolly had been keeping?

35:26.124 --> 35:27.082
Yeah.

35:27.208 --> 35:29.417
Remember your reaction
to seeing that?

35:29.585 --> 35:33.672
l was shocked. l was angry.
l couldn't believe it was,

35:33.840 --> 35:37.634
l consider it the worst betrayal that ever,
ever happened to me in my life.

35:37.802 --> 35:41.346
l couldn't believe that anyone
even could dream of such a thing.

35:41.514 --> 35:43.181
l never knew it existed.

35:43.349 --> 35:46.476
Did you recognize the information
that was contained in it

35:46.644 --> 35:49.146
as anything that you would
ever talk to John Connolly about?

35:49.313 --> 35:52.399
No. l asked the questions,
l got the answers.

35:52.567 --> 35:55.694
l was the guy who did the directing,
they didn't direct me.

35:55.862 --> 35:58.029
What are some of the things
they would give you

35:58.197 --> 35:59.531
in terms of tips?

35:59.699 --> 36:03.493
The thing that we needed most
of, number one, was wiretaps.

36:03.703 --> 36:06.705
And then, like, photo surveillance,
search warrants

36:06.873 --> 36:09.082
when they were coming,
indictments that were coming,

36:09.250 --> 36:11.918
so guys could get a chance
to make a run for it.

36:12.044 --> 36:15.172
Well, if you weren't providing
information to these people,

36:15.339 --> 36:18.508
why were they willing to give you
all this information?

36:18.676 --> 36:22.345
For money, for money.
Money's the common denominator.

36:22.597 --> 36:24.973
lt's a way of doing business.
lt happens all the time,

36:25.141 --> 36:26.808
it'll never stop.

36:26.976 --> 36:29.853
l remember you told me once
that Christmas

36:29.979 --> 36:32.355
- is for kids and cops.
- Correct.

36:32.565 --> 36:36.902
How many people would you be
paying off on a holiday period?

36:37.069 --> 36:40.238
Everybody l knew l took care of
at Christmas time.

36:40.448 --> 36:44.743
Put money in envelopes for all of
the different police. l had contacts

36:44.994 --> 36:48.872
on the state police,
the Boston police, the ATF,

36:49.040 --> 36:52.250
also in the FBl. There was more people
than John Connolly, but l'm not going

36:52.418 --> 36:56.046
to say who they were. l would
never say anybody's name, you know.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.797
But l took care of everybody.

36:57.965 --> 36:59.549
And was this in cash?

36:59.717 --> 37:03.428
Always cash.
l never handed anyone money,

37:03.596 --> 37:04.930
l handed them an envelope,

37:05.097 --> 37:08.308
makes it a little bit easier for them
to accept it, you know?

37:08.476 --> 37:12.145
Or l put the money maybe in a box,
if it was that much money.

37:12.313 --> 37:17.400
What was the most amount of money
you ever paid an FBl person, FBl agent?

37:17.568 --> 37:20.070
-At one time?
-Yeah.

37:20.238 --> 37:23.448
l don't know,
maybe 25,000, 50,000.

37:25.034 --> 37:28.411
Everybody can be corrupted.
People who are of the opinion

37:28.579 --> 37:31.831
that the FBl is above reproach...

37:32.583 --> 37:34.334
Well, they're just regular people.

37:34.460 --> 37:37.254
They put their pants on in the morning
just like everybody else.

37:37.463 --> 37:38.755
They are regular people,

37:38.881 --> 37:42.342
except they have a badge that says,
you know, "Special Agent."

37:42.551 --> 37:45.971
But there's nothing special
about them, they are regular people.

37:46.138 --> 37:49.724
lf you find their weakness, or their needs,
or if they have a problem

37:49.892 --> 37:53.186
and you can solve it for them,
you can corrupt them.

37:53.354 --> 37:56.314
Maybe they like money, maybe
they like wine, maybe they like jewelry,

37:56.482 --> 37:58.358
you know, trips, whatever.

37:58.484 --> 38:01.069
There's always a way
to corrupt somebody.

38:01.237 --> 38:05.240
Man: During a rapid-fire and sometimes
intense cross-examination,

38:05.449 --> 38:07.951
disgraced former FBl supervisor
John Morris

38:08.119 --> 38:10.829
admitted taking thousands
in cash from Bulger.

38:10.997 --> 38:14.916
Man 2: Mr. Morris, you were Mr. Bulger's
paid FBl informant, weren't you?

38:15.084 --> 38:17.377
Morris: That's not correct.
He did give me money,

38:17.545 --> 38:19.170
but l was not his paid informant.

38:19.338 --> 38:20.547
- Man 2: Gave you money?
- Morris: Yes.

38:20.673 --> 38:21.798
- Man 2: Gave you gifts?
- Morris: Yes.

38:21.966 --> 38:23.883
Man 2: You got a case of wine,
didn't you, from Mr. Connolly

38:24.051 --> 38:25.844
- in the basement of the federal office?
- Morris: That's correct.

38:26.012 --> 38:28.555
- Man 2: Did you throw it away?
- Morris: No, l kept it.

38:32.476 --> 38:35.353
You know, seeing a day
like today where, it's not clear,

38:35.479 --> 38:39.607
you see, you see thoroughly,
despicably corrupt FBl agents

38:39.775 --> 38:45.155
like John Morris, a supervisor.
You know, with just a moral...

38:47.033 --> 38:48.533
l mean, he was a moral coward.

38:48.701 --> 38:49.617
Boeri: And you see him,

38:49.785 --> 38:53.913
and you see Connolly taking advantage
of him in all his weakness,

38:54.081 --> 38:56.833
to bring him into the group.

38:57.001 --> 38:58.960
You see that, and you see
what was allowed.

38:59.128 --> 39:02.422
And so, the real story here,
is that our government

39:02.590 --> 39:07.218
enabled killers to run free
in this city, you know?

39:07.386 --> 39:09.512
Bulger used to wake up
in South Boston,

39:09.638 --> 39:11.514
and from South Boston
you can look across,

39:11.682 --> 39:14.851
and he would say, "l own that town."
And he really did.

39:15.019 --> 39:18.396
And he owned it because,
he was allowed to turn

39:18.564 --> 39:23.026
the Federal Bureau of lnvestigation into
the Bulger Bureau of lnvestigation.

39:23.194 --> 39:27.364
He put his tentacles into the Bureau
and he turned it into something

39:27.490 --> 39:30.325
that worked for him.
And it was because they were all

39:30.493 --> 39:35.955
crazed about getting the Mafia,
that they enabled the lrish Godfather

39:36.082 --> 39:37.582
to run the show here.

39:37.750 --> 39:40.877
And he was far more dangerous
than the ltalians.

39:45.633 --> 39:48.468
So what we need to do is get inside
a little bit and talk about

39:48.594 --> 39:51.930
how the FBl works,
what the roles of certain people were

39:52.098 --> 39:56.142
like Mr. Connolly and Mr. Morris.
And the more we can

39:56.310 --> 39:59.145
keep you on the stand,
from my perspective the better,

39:59.313 --> 40:02.690
because hopefully, it will be able to
really illustrate the effort you made,

40:02.858 --> 40:05.318
so they see the good side
of law enforcement.

40:05.486 --> 40:08.530
You recognized it was a problem, you
tried to do something to save lives,

40:08.697 --> 40:11.157
and because they were
pursuing whatever agenda they were,

40:11.242 --> 40:13.368
- they shut you down.
- Can l be candid with you?

40:13.536 --> 40:15.412
l think the whole thing was a con.

40:15.579 --> 40:18.915
l think at some point
they get in over their heads,

40:19.041 --> 40:24.963
and their success was wrapped
around Bulger, to the point where he

40:25.131 --> 40:26.423
had to be validated,

40:26.590 --> 40:31.344
he had to be made
into this informant

40:31.554 --> 40:33.680
that gave them all this information.

40:33.848 --> 40:34.848
Brennan: That's the myth.

40:34.974 --> 40:36.391
That's the myth.

40:37.059 --> 40:40.770
Fitzpatrick: l had a fascinating career.
l worked organized crime,

40:40.938 --> 40:44.858
l worked fugitives.
And in Mississippi, l had to work

40:45.025 --> 40:46.985
the Ku Klux Klan, bombings.

40:47.153 --> 40:50.738
And we ended
the bombings in Mississippi.

40:50.906 --> 40:53.408
Then l was
transferred back to Memphis.

40:54.535 --> 40:57.287
Martin Luther King came to Memphis
and l was told

40:57.455 --> 40:59.330
that King had just been shot.

41:00.749 --> 41:03.376
We found the gun
and through the fingerprints

41:03.502 --> 41:07.672
we identified James Earl Ray,
and we arrested him in London.

41:07.882 --> 41:12.427
ln Miami, we developed a case
called ABSCAM.

41:12.553 --> 41:17.140
ABSCAM turned out to be one of the
largest white-collar crime cases ever.

41:17.349 --> 41:21.019
And we arrested senators,
a sitting senator.

41:21.228 --> 41:26.608
So when l went back to headquarters,
and the Boston problem was going on,

41:26.775 --> 41:29.486
l was told they needed somebody
with this background

41:29.612 --> 41:35.074
to be sent to Boston. And my mission
was to find out what is going on

41:35.242 --> 41:38.786
between the Mass State Police,
the Boston Police,

41:38.954 --> 41:40.580
the local police, and the FBl,

41:40.748 --> 41:42.832
and how come they're not
getting along together.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.667
They had territorial issues.

41:44.919 --> 41:49.464
The state police was blaming the FBl
for cavorting with criminals,

41:49.632 --> 41:56.095
because they had seen Connolly and
Morris with Bulger and Flemmi.

41:56.639 --> 42:01.226
So they formed the opinion that the
agents were doing something bad.

42:01.393 --> 42:03.978
Well, as it turned out, they were.

42:04.146 --> 42:07.148
But they didn't know it then,
and l didn't know it then.

42:07.316 --> 42:11.027
So l go out and interview Bulger

42:11.195 --> 42:15.365
and assess him, a suitability,
if you will.

42:15.533 --> 42:20.578
l arrive at Bulger's place,
and met at the door by Bulger.

42:20.746 --> 42:21.955
He's got a baseball cap on,

42:22.122 --> 42:24.791
he's got sunglasses,
he's got a muscle shirt.

42:24.959 --> 42:28.294
l hold out my paw, my hand,
and he doesn't take it.

42:28.462 --> 42:33.841
Okay, you know. So l look at my
empty hand and l follow him in.

42:34.009 --> 42:39.931
The place is dark. And we walk
in the back. l say, "Look, Bulger,

42:40.182 --> 42:43.184
l'm here to find out what
you're doing for us.

42:43.352 --> 42:45.144
What are you doing for us?"

42:45.563 --> 42:51.484
And he gets angry. And about
that time, Connolly pops out.

42:51.819 --> 42:54.445
And remember this was supposed to be
mano a mano, one-on-one.

42:54.822 --> 43:00.368
And l get very angry. And l look over
and he says, "Hi, Fitzy, how you doing?"

43:00.744 --> 43:05.832
And l'm saying to myself, "Oh,"
you know, "this does not look good."

43:05.958 --> 43:09.294
But then we have
the conversation about him.

43:09.461 --> 43:11.421
l finally get the conversation back.

43:11.589 --> 43:14.674
And what he tells me is that
he's not an informant,

43:14.967 --> 43:20.847
that he has his own informants, and that
he pays them, they don't pay him,

43:21.098 --> 43:25.226
and that he's the head of a gang,
and that he runs the gang,

43:25.394 --> 43:29.314
that he's not going to testify.
Now all those elements

43:29.481 --> 43:33.776
are elements to me that l'm going to
close this guy as an informant.

43:33.944 --> 43:36.738
lf you're an informant for the FBl
and you're the head of the gang,

43:36.905 --> 43:39.991
then the FBl is validating the gang.

43:40.242 --> 43:43.911
You're actually part of the gang
and the management process.

43:44.079 --> 43:46.748
So to me, he's a big problem.

43:46.915 --> 43:50.084
Close him, get rid of him.
And that's what l go back

43:50.252 --> 43:51.669
and tell my boss.

43:51.837 --> 43:54.505
From that point on,
l get resistance.

43:54.673 --> 43:57.216
l'm more or less told, "You shut up.

43:57.384 --> 43:58.843
You're not allowed
to talk about this."

44:02.473 --> 44:04.265
Murphy: l was a very young reporter,

44:04.350 --> 44:09.145
but l had covered this huge Mafia trial
in Boston, it was the biggest ever.

44:09.313 --> 44:13.524
lt was, um... The FBl had planted a bug
in the north end headquarters

44:13.692 --> 44:15.234
of a guy named Jerry Angiulo.

44:15.402 --> 44:17.654
He was the underboss
of the Mafia,

44:17.821 --> 44:20.698
and ran everything in Boston.
And he and his brothers,

44:20.866 --> 44:23.951
the whole hierarchy went on trial,
it was an eight month trial.

44:25.287 --> 44:29.415
And there was all this evidence
of murders, and corruption,

44:29.583 --> 44:33.586
and they had tapes of Jerry Angiulo
bragging about murders.

44:33.754 --> 44:37.131
But they also had him talking about,
"l have a couple of guys

44:37.299 --> 44:39.926
that will do anything for us
named Whitey and Stevie,

44:40.052 --> 44:42.637
they'll kill anyone we ask them to."

44:42.805 --> 44:45.390
And so at the end of that trial,
it was a huge victory

44:45.557 --> 44:48.184
for the FBl in Boston.
They had just wiped out

44:48.352 --> 44:50.978
the New England family,
decimated them.

44:51.146 --> 44:54.982
Yesterday, a federal grand jury
sitting at Boston

44:55.150 --> 44:59.195
returned a 20 count indictment
charging seven individuals,

44:59.405 --> 45:01.322
including Gennaro Angiulo.

45:01.490 --> 45:04.409
Murphy: The Boston FBl,
they were heroes, and John Connolly

45:04.576 --> 45:08.413
was at the heart of that, he was
the guy with the most informants

45:08.539 --> 45:11.249
the most top echelon informants.

45:11.834 --> 45:14.794
So as the Mafia is being decimated,

45:14.962 --> 45:18.506
stepping into the vacuum
are Whitey Bulger and Steve Flemmi.

45:18.757 --> 45:22.427
And l'm asking the New England
strike force leader, Jerry O'Sullivan,

45:22.636 --> 45:25.513
why aren't you
going after Whitey and Stevie?

45:25.764 --> 45:29.142
You've already done the Mafia
repeatedly, what about these guys?

45:29.309 --> 45:32.228
And the answer is, "Oh, well,
they're not the threat

45:32.396 --> 45:36.482
that the Mafia is, the Mafia
is an international organization,

45:36.650 --> 45:37.775
Whitey's this local hoodlum.

45:37.943 --> 45:40.027
We're the New England
Organized Crime Strike Force,

45:40.195 --> 45:41.821
we go after the big guys."

45:42.072 --> 45:44.991
Well, Whitey was
becoming the big fish.

45:51.832 --> 45:57.003
Carney: Jim Bulger wants to explain
to the jury why for 25 years

45:57.129 --> 46:02.258
he could be on top of the organized
crime pyramid in Boston,

46:02.426 --> 46:05.011
and never once be charged
with a crime.

46:05.179 --> 46:10.808
The chief of the Organized Crime
Strike Force, Jeremiah O'Sullivan,

46:10.976 --> 46:16.397
promised him that he would not be
prosecuted for any federal crime,

46:16.565 --> 46:22.111
if in turn, he did something
that the government wanted.

46:23.155 --> 46:25.782
And that something
was not being an informant,

46:25.949 --> 46:27.617
it was something else.

46:27.743 --> 46:30.787
We've never revealed that information,

46:30.954 --> 46:34.457
but Jim will at trial,
if Jim takes the stand.

46:35.793 --> 46:39.003
Bulger: l had met secretly
with a high official

46:39.213 --> 46:42.965
in the federal strike force,
Jerry O'Sullivan, United States Attorney.

46:43.133 --> 46:45.384
He was concerned that someone
was going to kill him.

46:45.552 --> 46:48.012
He says that he's in trouble,
and he needs help.

46:48.180 --> 46:50.640
l felt bad for him, so l told him,

46:50.766 --> 46:53.893
l says, "Look, l'll take care of this
for you, but l'm no spy.

46:54.102 --> 46:56.729
We don't meet, l'll take care of it
my own way.

46:56.897 --> 46:58.523
lf you can accept that,
it'll be done."

46:58.690 --> 47:01.317
Carney: What was O'Sullivan's
promise to you?

47:01.485 --> 47:04.195
His promise to me was this.
He says, "Listen, Whitey,"

47:04.321 --> 47:07.865
he says, "l feel better, l'm under
your umbrella of protection,

47:08.033 --> 47:12.245
you're under mine," and he says,
"Any federal crimes or anything like that,

47:12.412 --> 47:15.206
don't worry about it." He says,
"l'll always be in your corner

47:15.374 --> 47:18.835
from this point on.
l'll protect you, you protect me."

47:19.002 --> 47:20.545
And that was the way it went.

47:22.422 --> 47:28.302
Bulger claims that he had
saved Jeremiah T. O'Sullivan

47:29.304 --> 47:35.226
from imminent danger,
presumably from Mafia retaliation

47:35.394 --> 47:40.231
for Jeremiah O'Sullivan's pursuit
of the Mafia and bringing it down,

47:40.399 --> 47:44.777
and that his deal with Jeremiah
T. O'Sullivan was a personal one,

47:44.945 --> 47:48.698
and he was going to
protect O'Sullivan in return

47:48.866 --> 47:54.161
for being granted immunity
for crimes past and future.

47:55.414 --> 47:58.958
John Connolly said that O'Sullivan
and Bulger pledged allegiance

47:59.084 --> 48:03.170
to each other.
That's a pretty significant event,

48:03.338 --> 48:06.799
an event by the way that was never
mentioned or even alluded to

48:06.967 --> 48:09.760
in this trial. The government
didn't want it to be,

48:09.970 --> 48:13.848
because then you would have
this very ironic situation

48:14.016 --> 48:17.602
of the US Attorney's Office in Boston,
the very office

48:17.769 --> 48:20.855
that is currently prosecuting
Whitey Bulger, had some kind of

48:21.064 --> 48:23.065
corrupt relationship with Whitey Bulger,

48:23.233 --> 48:25.484
that they're not being
totally forthcoming about.

48:26.778 --> 48:32.241
The notion that a federal prosecutor
could tell an organized crime figure

48:32.409 --> 48:34.952
that he could kill at will,
men and women,

48:35.120 --> 48:38.998
rich and poor,
Boston, Florida, Oklahoma,

48:39.082 --> 48:44.587
based on a personal promise
to guarantee his safety, is so absurd,

48:44.755 --> 48:50.051
so ludicrous, we've run out
of words like "ludicrous"

48:50.218 --> 48:51.844
and synonyms to describe it.

48:55.182 --> 48:58.267
Woman: Today they call to the stand
former number two

48:58.435 --> 49:02.563
in the FBl's Boston office,
Agent Bob Fitzpatrick.

49:02.731 --> 49:05.149
Fitzpatrick: Kind of upset over the fact
that this whole case

49:05.317 --> 49:09.320
is predicated on a bunch of people
l tried to put in jail,

49:09.488 --> 49:13.574
and the true story
is that the criminal justice system

49:13.700 --> 49:17.536
has basically been co-opted
by Bulger, by Flemmi.

49:17.704 --> 49:21.248
Now certain people
are culpable in the FBl,

49:21.416 --> 49:25.127
but certain people are culpable
in the Department of Justice.

49:25.212 --> 49:28.214
So l've got to go there
and present the truth.

49:28.382 --> 49:31.175
Woman: Former FBl agent
Robert Fitzpatrick

49:31.343 --> 49:35.304
started at the Boston office in 1981 ,
and said the atmosphere was tense.

49:35.472 --> 49:38.015
As Assistant Special Agent
ln Charge, Fitzpatrick

49:38.183 --> 49:41.102
evaluated James Bulger's role
as an informant.

49:41.269 --> 49:45.690
Fitzpatrick said Bulger surprised him
by saying he was not an FBl informant,

49:45.857 --> 49:49.860
that he was never paid anything
by the FBl to provide information.

49:49.987 --> 49:52.613
Fitzpatrick recommended
closing Bulger as an informant,

49:52.864 --> 49:54.490
but headquarters
thought Bulger was too valuable

49:54.658 --> 49:58.369
in its quest to bring down the Mafia.
After several hours on the stand,

49:58.537 --> 50:01.580
prosecutors began a tough
cross-examination of Fitzpatrick.

50:01.707 --> 50:02.832
First question?

50:03.000 --> 50:05.334
Kelly: You're a man who likes to
make up stories, aren't you?

50:05.377 --> 50:06.252
Fitzpatrick: No.

50:06.420 --> 50:09.005
Kelly: Didn't you gratuitously claim
credit for arresting the mob boss

50:09.172 --> 50:11.132
- Jerry Angiulo?
- Fitzpatrick: l did arrest him.

50:11.299 --> 50:13.676
Kelly: Haven't you in fact pretended
that you were the one

50:13.844 --> 50:16.178
who found the rifle that killed
Martin Luther King?

50:16.346 --> 50:18.764
Fitzpatrick: l did find the rifle,
when l was at the scene.

50:18.932 --> 50:21.058
Woman: At one point,
Assistant US Attorney Brian Kelly said,

50:21.226 --> 50:22.852
"Are you on medication?"

50:23.020 --> 50:25.938
Fitzpatrick said,
"Yes." Kelly said sarcastically,

50:26.106 --> 50:27.314
"Does it affect your memory?"

50:27.482 --> 50:29.775
"Not that l recall,"
replied Fitzpatrick,

50:29.985 --> 50:32.278
as several people in court laughed.

50:33.488 --> 50:35.197
Woman: How do you think you were
treated on the stand?

50:35.365 --> 50:36.240
Not good.

50:36.450 --> 50:37.908
What do you mean?

50:38.076 --> 50:40.661
l thought the guy was very angry,
and l don't know why.

50:40.829 --> 50:43.873
You know, it should've been
a lot more professional,

50:44.041 --> 50:47.626
and l didn't feel that professionalism.

50:47.711 --> 50:50.838
And plus, as a former law enforcement
officer working with these guys,

50:51.006 --> 50:52.381
l should have had
a little more respect.

50:52.591 --> 50:56.594
You know, l'm actually disgusted
in some sense, to be honest with you.

50:56.803 --> 50:59.180
To hear Fitzpatrick
get grilled like that,

50:59.347 --> 51:02.183
and not all the other agents?
l think it's garbage.

51:02.350 --> 51:04.727
That's the first time that
the prosecution has cross-examined

51:04.895 --> 51:06.395
anybody in that manner.

51:06.563 --> 51:08.939
Other than that, they been up there
kissing everybody's ass.

51:09.191 --> 51:12.610
All the dirty FBl agents,
all ex-mobsters.

51:12.778 --> 51:15.905
Look at Morris, they didn't treat
Morris like Fitzpatrick.

51:16.073 --> 51:17.782
These are the guys
they gave deals to.

51:17.949 --> 51:21.160
Fitzpatrick tried to go out of his way
and do the right thing,

51:21.328 --> 51:24.914
but he's still fighting for a pension.
Morris got a pension.

51:25.957 --> 51:29.210
Kelly: With respect to my
cross-examination of Fitzpatrick,

51:29.419 --> 51:32.004
l do think it was fair.
l think when people

51:32.172 --> 51:35.132
come into federal court
and tell ridiculous stories,

51:35.258 --> 51:39.470
they can expect to be confronted
aggressively with cross-examination.

51:39.554 --> 51:41.097
That's the purpose
of cross-examination,

51:41.264 --> 51:43.557
you try to expose
what isn't accurate.

51:43.725 --> 51:45.434
Now Fitzpatrick was in fact

51:45.602 --> 51:49.063
in the chain of command
at exactly the same time

51:49.231 --> 51:53.234
all this crime and buffoonery
was occurring. And yet years later,

51:53.401 --> 51:56.862
he wanted to distance himself
from it and pretend

51:56.988 --> 51:58.489
he was trying to stop it.

52:00.033 --> 52:03.119
English: Bob Fitzpatrick was one of
the first people to say

52:03.328 --> 52:06.664
there's something rotten here,
and to try to call attention to it.

52:06.832 --> 52:10.751
He's drummed out of the FBl,
now here he is at this trial,

52:10.961 --> 52:14.880
and they really seek to destroy him,
they seek to humiliate him,

52:15.048 --> 52:20.261
and it was very personal, because
when he comes in to trial to testify,

52:20.428 --> 52:23.389
he is a rebuke to the entire system

52:23.557 --> 52:26.809
and to everyone who stood back

52:26.977 --> 52:31.522
for 20 years that Bulger was in
power and allowed it to happen.

52:31.690 --> 52:35.109
And a lot of people were
complicit in that.

52:36.820 --> 52:41.365
Brennan: lt was a little bit tormenting
to watch Fitzpatrick get beat up.

52:41.533 --> 52:43.701
lt shows you that you're
either with the government,

52:43.869 --> 52:47.621
and they'll accept, and guide,
and protect you

52:47.789 --> 52:49.999
in any way they can, or you're
against the government,

52:50.167 --> 52:51.709
and they'll try to destroy you.

52:53.879 --> 52:56.505
We know that there was
a relationship between

52:56.673 --> 52:59.925
the Department of Justice and
the success of James Bulger,

53:00.093 --> 53:02.344
and nobody wants to tell that story.

53:02.512 --> 53:05.848
They protected him for
their own reasons for decades,

53:06.057 --> 53:07.766
and they're still lying about it.

53:07.934 --> 53:12.021
At this trial, the United States
Attorney's Office has an exhibit.

53:12.147 --> 53:13.564
lt's a very important exhibit.

53:13.732 --> 53:16.233
lt is a memorandum
from the Special Agent ln Charge

53:16.401 --> 53:19.028
in the 1980s by the name
of Lawrence Sarhatt.

53:19.196 --> 53:22.823
ln this memorandum, Sarhatt says
that he had a conversation

53:22.908 --> 53:27.119
with James Bulger when they met
at a hotel. And the government pretends

53:27.287 --> 53:31.415
that this memorandum somehow shows
James Bulger is an informant.

53:31.583 --> 53:34.251
So, during the trial
we learn information

53:34.502 --> 53:37.213
that there's a secret safe
in the Boston SAC,

53:37.422 --> 53:40.799
that's Special Agent in Charge's office
in the C3 unit of the FBl,

53:41.051 --> 53:45.095
the criminal division, and in that safe,
supposedly documents will go into

53:45.222 --> 53:46.555
and never come out again.

53:46.723 --> 53:49.183
We also learned
that there was a secretary

53:49.309 --> 53:53.229
who had worked for decades
in the Boston FBl.

53:53.438 --> 53:56.607
She's 82 years old, and still working
for the Boston FBl.

53:56.816 --> 54:00.694
So, she is the person who knows
whether or not a secret safe exists.

54:13.250 --> 54:15.251
Brennan: When we called
this secretary as a witness,

54:15.418 --> 54:18.420
mysteriously new documents appeared.

54:18.588 --> 54:20.339
While they told the jury
and the public

54:20.507 --> 54:23.717
- this is the truth at this trial...
- Man: At this trial.

54:23.802 --> 54:25.636
what we learned
when we called the secretary

54:25.762 --> 54:27.805
is there were other documents
that existed.

54:27.931 --> 54:31.600
The same exact memo
that the government introduced

54:31.768 --> 54:36.272
at this trial from the same person,
exact copy of it,

54:36.439 --> 54:39.400
we learned that the memo
was not complete,

54:39.567 --> 54:41.443
because there's
an observation section.

54:42.821 --> 54:45.281
Mr. Sarhatt says, "l am not certain
that l am convinced

54:45.448 --> 54:48.242
the informant is telling
the full story of his involvement.

54:48.410 --> 54:50.369
Consideration should be given
to closing him

54:50.453 --> 54:52.121
and making him a target."

54:54.082 --> 54:55.499
So what do they do
with this information?

54:55.667 --> 55:00.212
Well, the government at this trial,
leaves that part out until we expose it.

55:00.380 --> 55:03.841
What else did they do with
the information back in 1980?

55:04.009 --> 55:07.553
We'd learn from the secretary exactly
what they did with that information.

55:07.762 --> 55:10.723
The actual memorandum
that was given to her,

55:10.890 --> 55:13.642
she put in an envelope
by direction of Mr. Sarhatt,

55:13.810 --> 55:18.689
and put in the safe.
And it says, "Strictly Eyes-Only."

55:18.857 --> 55:21.984
Nobody other than the Special Agent
in Charge should see it.

55:22.152 --> 55:24.611
And anytime a new Special Agent
ln Charge would come in

55:24.779 --> 55:28.157
and take the place of an old one
who was resigning or moving on,

55:28.325 --> 55:30.367
she would tell them
about this document in the safe,

55:30.535 --> 55:32.953
and it stayed in that safe
for generations

55:33.121 --> 55:36.206
of Special Agents in Charge
when they took each other's spot.

55:37.542 --> 55:40.210
And one Special Agent ln Charge
said, "Get rid of this,

55:40.378 --> 55:42.129
or we'll all get fired."

55:44.424 --> 55:46.216
What could be so terrible
about this document

55:46.384 --> 55:49.470
that they would lose their job?
That James Bulger was an informant?

55:49.637 --> 55:51.638
Would that be so terrible
everybody would get fired?

55:51.806 --> 55:54.141
Or that they knew
he wasn't an informant,

55:54.309 --> 55:55.934
they knew that he
should've been targeted,

55:56.102 --> 55:58.187
and he was being protected.

56:03.068 --> 56:07.279
Kelly: The defense complaining
about the Sarhatt memo

56:07.447 --> 56:11.533
is another desperate tactic by them,
which is another version of,

56:11.701 --> 56:12.701
"Let's pretend,"

56:12.869 --> 56:15.913
because they are pretending
they didn't have these documents,

56:16.122 --> 56:20.292
which they did. There's nothing sinister
about it, it was disclosed.

56:20.502 --> 56:24.171
They had it. And it didn't...
it didn't prove anything,

56:24.339 --> 56:27.132
other than the fact that
there was a head of the FBl

56:27.300 --> 56:30.386
who was concerned about
keeping Bulger open as an informant.

56:30.553 --> 56:33.931
lf anything, the Sarhatt memo
proves Bulger was an informant.

56:34.099 --> 56:37.351
He sat with the head of
the Boston FBl for four hours

56:37.519 --> 56:41.188
and gave them all sorts of information,
most of which was useless,

56:41.314 --> 56:43.899
but in fact, he was
reporting it to the FBl,

56:44.067 --> 56:46.318
and that makes him an informant.

56:50.573 --> 56:54.201
Woman: The latest twist in the trial
of James Whitey Bulger.

56:54.369 --> 56:57.454
Man: On Tuesday, Stephen Rakes was
dropped from the witness list.

56:57.622 --> 57:00.833
Woman 2: Rakes had been set to testify,
but prosecutors told him he was

57:01.000 --> 57:02.876
no longer needed to
take the stand.

57:03.044 --> 57:05.796
Thirty years of torment, and
now it's coming to an end.

57:07.424 --> 57:09.466
( phone ringing )

57:09.634 --> 57:13.762
Hello. No, l haven't been
able to get...

57:13.930 --> 57:16.348
l'm going by his house later
because l haven't been able

57:16.516 --> 57:18.767
to get a hold of him or anything.

57:18.935 --> 57:23.021
Yeah, he's probably
beside himself about it.

57:23.189 --> 57:25.023
They took him off the witness list.

57:25.191 --> 57:27.484
l tried calling him after court,

57:27.652 --> 57:31.572
and his phone went right to voicemail.
l call him all day yesterday,

57:31.739 --> 57:35.909
same, after court, same thing.
So, l'm going to go over.

57:36.077 --> 57:39.621
l figure, give him
a little time to cool down.

57:39.789 --> 57:41.290
Yeah.

57:41.416 --> 57:43.917
( indistinct voice on phone )

57:44.043 --> 57:45.502
Yeah.

57:47.213 --> 57:48.714
Where?

57:49.007 --> 57:51.717
l don't know, what was
the body described like?

57:54.137 --> 57:58.140
That's him.

57:59.309 --> 58:01.018
Motherfucker.

58:02.437 --> 58:05.063
l'm going by his house right now.

58:05.231 --> 58:07.649
Yeah, l'll call you
right back, bye.

58:07.817 --> 58:08.859
- He's dead.
- Woman: He's dead?

58:09.027 --> 58:13.322
What, what?
What? What happened?

58:13.531 --> 58:16.825
They found him on
the side of the road in Lincoln.

58:16.993 --> 58:18.076
Woman: ln Lincoln, Massachusetts?

58:18.244 --> 58:18.994
Yeah.

58:19.162 --> 58:20.496
Woman: Who's in Lincoln,
Massachusetts?

58:20.663 --> 58:22.372
l gotta go by his house right now.

58:22.582 --> 58:24.708
Woman: Who's in...
Oh, my God, no way.

58:24.876 --> 58:27.961
Man: Stephen Rakes is a courthouse
regular, coming each day

58:28.171 --> 58:31.673
to the Whitey Bulger trial, waiting
for the day when he would testify,

58:31.841 --> 58:33.884
but Rakes would never
get that chance.

58:34.594 --> 58:35.844
See the corruption?

58:36.012 --> 58:38.013
Woman: Well, wait,
let's not jump to conclusions.

58:38.181 --> 58:40.140
Let's say a prayer that he's okay.

58:40.308 --> 58:42.434
- He's not here.
- Woman: Oh, my God.

58:42.644 --> 58:44.853
- Woman: ls his car here, Stephen?
- No.

58:44.979 --> 58:48.023
Woman: Oh, my God. Can you go
knock on the door and see?

58:48.191 --> 58:49.775
Davis: l knew something was wrong,

58:49.901 --> 58:52.736
because l talk to him every day,
we meet for coffee.

58:52.904 --> 58:54.488
( ringing doorbell )

58:54.614 --> 58:56.949
You know, and that's got
my stomach turned, thinking,

58:57.116 --> 58:59.701
"ls anyone else in danger?"

58:59.869 --> 59:02.329
With his testimony,
l used to say to him,

59:02.497 --> 59:04.623
"Steve, what do you have to say?
l mean, what is it?"

59:04.791 --> 59:07.251
"Oh, you'll see, you'll see.

59:07.377 --> 59:11.338
Believe me, you'll see how deep
the people... you'll see."

59:11.464 --> 59:14.633
Woman: Key witness in
the Whitey Bulger trial is dead.

59:14.801 --> 59:18.178
Woman 2: A source tells CNN,
authorities called the death suspicious.

59:18.346 --> 59:20.973
Man: We don't know what the cause
of death was, no sign of trauma.

59:21.140 --> 59:22.891
Don't know if this was a suicide.

59:23.059 --> 59:25.686
Man 2: lt's a very suspicious death.
And the body is seven miles away

59:25.812 --> 59:28.021
from where his automobile was,

59:28.189 --> 59:30.440
and he did not have
any identification on him.

59:31.025 --> 59:33.318
They'll probably say cause of
death was a heart attack,

59:33.486 --> 59:38.532
an aneurysm, you know, and is it?
We'll never really know.

59:38.700 --> 59:41.535
Do you believe what they tell you,
or did something really happen?

59:41.744 --> 59:45.414
Do you trust your people that are
supposed to serve and protect

59:45.582 --> 59:47.666
when you know
what we're living through,

59:47.834 --> 59:50.419
and what's happened in this family?

59:50.587 --> 59:54.423
What is the truth anymore,
and who do you believe?

01:00:00.013 --> 01:00:03.473
Sometimes, you know, l wish
that this never happened.

01:00:03.641 --> 01:00:06.560
This life... because all the hurt.

01:00:06.728 --> 01:00:09.563
l've had a lot of hurt, Joe,
l mean, from...

01:00:09.731 --> 01:00:14.985
l'm talking from... l can remember
far back as four or five years old.

01:00:16.237 --> 01:00:20.616
l don't have any faith no more.
l want the truth.

01:00:20.783 --> 01:00:23.577
This has tied me up for 32 years.

01:00:23.745 --> 01:00:26.413
They say, you know, ease your pain.

01:00:26.623 --> 01:00:32.544
And honestly, Joe, l got to tell you this,
and l say it with my throat,

01:00:32.712 --> 01:00:35.297
l'd kill this cocksucker
if they ever let him go free,

01:00:35.465 --> 01:00:37.466
and l'd tell the...

01:00:40.261 --> 01:00:44.806
Tell the judge that and l wouldn't
give a fuck about going away for it.

01:00:45.016 --> 01:00:48.393
This prick here is never gonna
run free, because l...

01:00:48.603 --> 01:00:50.896
l mean it, l'd take him out.

01:00:56.986 --> 01:01:00.238
Man: Prosecutors put former hit man
John Martorano on the stand

01:01:00.406 --> 01:01:03.283
to prove that Bulger's reign
was murderous.

01:01:03.451 --> 01:01:05.702
Woman: Martorano was perhaps
the most feared member

01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:07.454
of Bulger's Winter Hill Gang.

01:01:07.705 --> 01:01:11.208
...testified he was James Whitey
Bulger's chief executioner.

01:01:11.376 --> 01:01:12.751
Man: Killing was routine.

01:01:12.919 --> 01:01:15.253
ln all, Martorano
murdered at least 20 people.

01:01:15.463 --> 01:01:17.839
Woman: Martorano served
just 12 years in prison

01:01:18.007 --> 01:01:20.425
as part of a deal
with federal prosecutors.

01:01:20.593 --> 01:01:22.928
Man 2: The confessed murderer
was asked about a number of killings

01:01:23.096 --> 01:01:26.264
he committed, including
the killing of Roger Wheeler,

01:01:26.432 --> 01:01:28.975
the president of World Jai-Alai,
in Oklahoma.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:34.564
Boeri: The Jai Alai murders are
the heart of this, because they show

01:01:34.732 --> 01:01:37.984
how ugly and sordid
everything became.

01:01:38.152 --> 01:01:42.948
This is shocking. He is killed
in daylight, at a country club,

01:01:43.116 --> 01:01:45.909
while kids at the swimming pool
are watching.

01:01:46.953 --> 01:01:48.203
Wyshak: And who was Roger Wheeler?

01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:51.331
Martorano: He was the owner of Jai Alai,
World Jai Alai... it was a game.

01:01:51.499 --> 01:01:53.166
Wyshak: Did that game
involve gambling?

01:01:53.334 --> 01:01:54.918
Martorano: Yes.

01:01:55.086 --> 01:01:58.672
Man: l never did like gambling.
But the Bank of Boston

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:00.799
brought him this Jai Alai deal.

01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:04.177
And part of the deal,
because l kept asking him about this,

01:02:04.387 --> 01:02:07.889
he said that the FBl
keeps it clean.

01:02:08.099 --> 01:02:12.018
lt's run by retired FBl agents
that specialized

01:02:12.270 --> 01:02:15.981
in investigating organized crime,
and they keep the Mob out.

01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:19.109
Boeri: So, Wheeler buys this company,
World Jai Alai.

01:02:19.235 --> 01:02:23.155
Unbeknownst to him, it's infiltrated
by the Mob already,

01:02:23.322 --> 01:02:24.865
connected to Winter Hill.

01:02:25.032 --> 01:02:28.285
Weeks: World Jai Alai
hired John Callahan,

01:02:28.453 --> 01:02:30.871
a friend of John Martorano,
as a president.

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:34.166
And they had H. Paul Rico
head of security.

01:02:34.292 --> 01:02:37.586
And Rico was a corrupt
ex-FBl agent, and he had

01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:40.088
and he had relationships
with Winter Hill.

01:02:40.256 --> 01:02:45.302
Callahan is actually the architect who
first brought the scheme forward with Rico,

01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:49.181
to kill Wheeler, and then
go to his widow and buy it,

01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:51.767
buy World Jai Alai,
they would be the owners,

01:02:51.851 --> 01:02:54.436
and the money was going to be
kicked back to Winter Hill.

01:02:54.562 --> 01:02:58.482
Paul Rico'd resell it to the people back
up here that he was involved with before.

01:02:58.649 --> 01:03:00.776
Martorano: Callahan... he asked me to
take out Roger Wheeler.

01:03:00.943 --> 01:03:02.527
Wyshak: What was
your reaction to that?

01:03:02.695 --> 01:03:04.613
Martorano: l couldn't do that
without everybody else on board.

01:03:04.906 --> 01:03:07.449
Wyshak: And when you said you had
to get everybody else on board,

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:08.533
who did you mean?

01:03:08.701 --> 01:03:11.661
Martorano: Whitey and Stevie.
They said they were on board,

01:03:11.829 --> 01:03:14.581
whatever they could do
to help, they'd help.

01:03:14.749 --> 01:03:18.752
Weeks: ln the end of it, John
Martorano shot Wheeler in the head.

01:03:24.926 --> 01:03:29.012
Cullen: There were honest FBl agents
in Oklahoma who wanted to get to

01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:31.348
the bottom of the murder
of Roger Wheeler.

01:03:31.516 --> 01:03:35.685
Whitey Bulger and Stevie Flemmi
were implicated, and the FBl in Boston

01:03:35.853 --> 01:03:40.023
lied to the FBl in Oklahoma.
They said Bulger and Flemmi

01:03:40.107 --> 01:03:43.485
had nothing to do with it,
they have alibis, we've checked it out.

01:03:43.653 --> 01:03:47.113
That was a lie. And murderers
went free because of it.

01:03:49.867 --> 01:03:53.662
Man: You hold the FBl
as responsible as Bulger

01:03:53.788 --> 01:03:54.913
for the death of your father?

01:03:55.122 --> 01:03:59.042
More responsible.
The FBl has protected him,

01:03:59.293 --> 01:04:01.378
they have supervised him,

01:04:01.504 --> 01:04:06.216
and without the FBl,
my father would be alive today.

01:04:08.594 --> 01:04:13.348
Next person that emerges
in this story is Brian Halloran.

01:04:13.516 --> 01:04:17.310
Halloran is facing his own problems,
namely he's charged

01:04:17.478 --> 01:04:19.437
with murdering a drug dealer.

01:04:19.647 --> 01:04:22.774
He needs help.
And this is the typical system

01:04:23.025 --> 01:04:25.360
of informants
and cooperating witnesses,

01:04:25.528 --> 01:04:28.613
he wants to make a deal.
And so he comes forward,

01:04:28.781 --> 01:04:32.117
and he can give up Whitey Bulger
and Stephen Flemmi he says,

01:04:32.285 --> 01:04:35.662
because they were part of a plot
to kill Roger Wheeler.

01:04:35.830 --> 01:04:38.957
So, Halloran is a threat
to Bulger and Flemmi.

01:04:39.125 --> 01:04:42.377
They eliminate Halloran,
and in the process of eliminating him,

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:45.881
they kill Michael Donahue,

01:04:46.090 --> 01:04:48.550
somebody he knew
from the neighborhood.

01:04:50.052 --> 01:04:52.262
Woman: Of the 19
alleged murder victims,

01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:55.432
their loved ones have become
fixtures at this trial and today,

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:57.809
Patricia Donahue took the stand.

01:04:57.977 --> 01:05:00.770
Donahue: All l want to do is clear
my husband's name.

01:05:00.938 --> 01:05:06.109
l did not want him associated with
the Mafia, with Whitey Bulger,

01:05:06.277 --> 01:05:08.069
with Brian Halloran.

01:05:08.237 --> 01:05:11.907
You know, he wasn't into that, he
didn't even know those people.

01:05:12.074 --> 01:05:15.869
He was innocent,
he wasn't in trouble,

01:05:16.037 --> 01:05:19.247
he wasn't a Mafia man,
he wasn't a killer.

01:05:19.415 --> 01:05:22.375
Mike was 32 when he died.

01:05:22.501 --> 01:05:25.503
He actually would've
been 33 in a week.

01:05:27.131 --> 01:05:30.967
Whitey pulled the trigger,
but l blame the FBl, too.

01:05:31.135 --> 01:05:33.219
They knew what was gonna happen.

01:05:34.138 --> 01:05:35.013
( sirens in distance )

01:05:35.139 --> 01:05:36.222
There goes Whitey.

01:05:36.349 --> 01:05:37.682
- ( woman laughing )
- That's funny.

01:05:37.850 --> 01:05:41.603
- l'm serious, lookit.
- Woman: There's Whitey, people.

01:05:42.188 --> 01:05:45.148
We'll see you in there, you lowlife.

01:05:47.276 --> 01:05:50.695
Man: Michael Donahue was murdered
simply because he offered

01:05:50.821 --> 01:05:53.365
a neighbor, Brian Halloran,
a ride home.

01:05:53.532 --> 01:05:55.909
Unbeknownst to Michael Donahue,

01:05:56.077 --> 01:06:00.246
Brian Halloran at the time
was cooperating with the FBl,

01:06:00.456 --> 01:06:04.793
and was about to reveal
that James Bulger was involved

01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:07.671
in the murder of Roger Wheeler.

01:06:08.339 --> 01:06:11.466
Fitzpatrick: After the
Wheeler murder, Halloran comes in,

01:06:11.634 --> 01:06:15.387
and he wants to talk.
We open him up as an informant,

01:06:15.554 --> 01:06:20.892
and he begins telling us that this
was done by Bulger and Flemmi.

01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:25.355
And so, l opened up murder cases
on Bulger and Flemmi.

01:06:26.357 --> 01:06:28.024
Now you have to understand
something here.

01:06:28.192 --> 01:06:31.569
Halloran is giving us the subject.

01:06:31.737 --> 01:06:35.699
He's telling us this guy
is the killer of Wheeler,

01:06:35.866 --> 01:06:40.704
Bulger is the killer of Wheeler.
That's a plus, that's a big plus.

01:06:40.871 --> 01:06:43.999
They should be very happy,
they being the Department of Justice

01:06:44.208 --> 01:06:47.252
and the Strike Force Chief
Jerry O'Sullivan.

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:49.504
And yet, they're not.

01:06:49.672 --> 01:06:53.591
O'Sullivan said,
"No, l'm not gonna put Halloran

01:06:53.718 --> 01:06:55.552
in a witness protection program."

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:57.012
Why not?

01:06:57.138 --> 01:06:58.930
So l went over O'Sullivan's head.

01:06:59.098 --> 01:07:01.725
l went to the United
States Attorney, Bill Weld.

01:07:01.892 --> 01:07:05.645
And l said to Bill Weld,
"Bill, we got a problem.

01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:10.316
l got an informant, Halloran, that's
gonna tell us who did this stuff.

01:07:10.484 --> 01:07:13.028
And O'Sullivan is feeling
that he should not be

01:07:13.195 --> 01:07:14.779
in the Witness Protection program."

01:07:14.947 --> 01:07:17.907
l told Weld, he's gonna get whacked.

01:07:18.117 --> 01:07:23.121
At the same time, John Morris
at the FBl, told John Connolly

01:07:23.289 --> 01:07:27.042
that Brian Halloran was
revealing Bulger's involvement.

01:07:27.209 --> 01:07:29.627
And Morris knew full well
that John Connolly

01:07:29.837 --> 01:07:33.214
would convey that information
to Whitey Bulger. And he did.

01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:38.011
Weeks: We received word from the FBl
that Brian Halloran

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:40.680
was cooperating with the FBl
about the Wheeler murder.

01:07:40.848 --> 01:07:44.601
So Jim Bulger and Steve Flemmi,
myself and other people

01:07:44.769 --> 01:07:46.019
go out looking for him.

01:07:46.187 --> 01:07:50.607
One day we got word that Brian
Halloran was down the waterfront.

01:07:50.816 --> 01:07:53.777
Michael Donahue happened to
have gone down to the pier

01:07:53.944 --> 01:07:57.280
in South Boston to get fish
to use as bait

01:07:57.448 --> 01:08:02.118
to take one of his sons on a fishing trip.
And he stopped to have a beer

01:08:02.286 --> 01:08:06.956
on his way home. He ran into
Brian Halloran who was his neighbor.

01:08:07.124 --> 01:08:09.292
He offered to give him a ride home.

01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:11.836
So we went down the waterfront,
you know,

01:08:11.962 --> 01:08:15.757
we got the hit car, weapons,
and everyone, you know.

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:17.634
He was geared up and stuff.
And l went down ahead,

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:19.551
l sat across the street and watched

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:21.845
to make sure Brian Halloran
was, in fact, there.

01:08:22.014 --> 01:08:24.890
You know, when he started
coming out, l told Jim Bulger,

01:08:25.059 --> 01:08:28.310
and Jim Bulger pulled up, and he shot
Brian Halloran and killed him.

01:08:29.729 --> 01:08:32.398
Michael Donahue
was an unintended victim.

01:08:32.566 --> 01:08:36.111
He wasn't supposed to be
getting killed, it was Brian Halloran

01:08:36.278 --> 01:08:39.113
that we were going to kill.
But he hung around with Halloran.

01:08:39.281 --> 01:08:41.698
You want to hang around
with gangsters and wise guys,

01:08:41.867 --> 01:08:43.576
this is what happens.

01:08:46.205 --> 01:08:50.166
Woman: Patricia Donahue has spent
the last 32 years raising three sons

01:08:50.376 --> 01:08:51.876
without her husband Michael.

01:08:52.044 --> 01:08:55.964
Today she finally faced his alleged killer,
James Whitey Bulger.

01:08:57.299 --> 01:09:01.051
Donahue: lt was Mother's Day, and Tommy
had just made his first Communion.

01:09:01.178 --> 01:09:05.180
l was in the kitchen cooking.
A news bulletin came on the TV

01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:08.017
about a gangland slaying.
l didn't pay any attention to it,

01:09:08.185 --> 01:09:09.935
because l knew it didn't
concern me.

01:09:10.145 --> 01:09:13.356
And l just so happened to look up
and see the car.

01:09:13.482 --> 01:09:16.901
And l said, "l think that was his car."
l mean, l was hyperventilating,

01:09:17.069 --> 01:09:19.319
l was, like, confused.

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:21.823
l'm thinking, "Oh my God,
where is he?

01:09:21.991 --> 01:09:24.783
l need to be with him,
l don't want him to die alone,

01:09:24.910 --> 01:09:28.621
l have so much stuff l want
to say to him," you know?

01:09:28.788 --> 01:09:32.125
And, nobody came
until ten o'clock that night.

01:09:32.334 --> 01:09:34.836
So when they took me
to the hospital finally,

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:36.712
he had already passed.

01:09:37.548 --> 01:09:40.550
Within days of the killing, FBl agents,
they came to my house

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:45.305
and harassed me. Accused me of having
an affair with my husband's friend

01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:47.557
that was staying with us
from out of town.

01:09:47.725 --> 01:09:51.394
l mean, l was like," What?"
For months, they used to sit

01:09:51.562 --> 01:09:54.856
outside my salon, you know.
They'd sit outside the house

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:56.983
and l'd say, "How you doing,
have you found out

01:09:57.109 --> 01:09:58.735
any more information on my husband?"

01:09:58.903 --> 01:10:03.781
"No, nothing yet."
And the whole time they knew.

01:10:03.949 --> 01:10:06.576
And l was devastated
because l did not think

01:10:06.744 --> 01:10:08.870
that the government was like that.

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:11.080
You know, you think you know them,

01:10:11.248 --> 01:10:14.292
and you find out they're
not who you think they are.

01:10:15.711 --> 01:10:17.921
Murphy: Bulger and Flemmi
are suspects,

01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:20.131
now, not only in the Wheeler murder,

01:10:20.257 --> 01:10:22.258
but in the Halloran
and Donahue murders.

01:10:22.468 --> 01:10:27.305
And nothing happens. The FBl
decides to look for John Callahan,

01:10:27.473 --> 01:10:30.099
"We need to question John Callahan,
he's the other guy

01:10:30.267 --> 01:10:33.186
who was also implicated
in the murder of Roger Wheeler."

01:10:33.354 --> 01:10:37.106
They're hunting for him to question him,
and then he's murdered.

01:10:38.359 --> 01:10:41.778
Again, nothing happens.
The FBl in Boston,

01:10:41.946 --> 01:10:44.697
who do they send out to question
Bulger and Flemmi?

01:10:44.865 --> 01:10:47.075
John Connolly. Their handler.

01:10:47.243 --> 01:10:49.494
Because we know he's objective, right?

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:54.916
The FBl,
they haven't been on our side

01:10:55.042 --> 01:10:57.377
since the day they killed my father.

01:10:57.586 --> 01:11:00.838
Took them four and a half hours
to come to my house to tell my mother,

01:11:01.006 --> 01:11:03.883
my mother,
whether my father was dead or alive.

01:11:04.051 --> 01:11:06.761
They covered up
the murder of my father,

01:11:06.929 --> 01:11:11.516
helped pretty much set it up.
lt's, it's, it's shameful, it's shameful.

01:11:11.684 --> 01:11:13.768
l think the FBl is
worse than the Mafia.

01:11:13.936 --> 01:11:16.729
They're the most organized
crime family on the planet,

01:11:16.981 --> 01:11:19.899
who can do whatever they want,
change the laws when they want,

01:11:20.067 --> 01:11:22.235
and they're not to be screwed with,
to be honest with you.

01:11:22.403 --> 01:11:24.904
We've seen that first-hand.

01:11:25.656 --> 01:11:28.491
Woman: Tell us what it was like
to be on the stand today

01:11:28.701 --> 01:11:31.160
and look into Whitey Bulger's eyes.

01:11:31.328 --> 01:11:34.455
Well, l looked right at him,
but of course he wouldn't look at me,

01:11:34.665 --> 01:11:36.916
so as far as l'm concerned,
he's a coward.

01:11:37.084 --> 01:11:41.379
He can kill people and not look the
victims in the face, that's a coward.

01:11:41.547 --> 01:11:42.588
That's a coward.

01:11:42.756 --> 01:11:45.842
You've been saying you're getting
more answers from his defense team--

01:11:46.051 --> 01:11:47.844
l am, l am.

01:11:48.012 --> 01:11:49.887
And then Jay Carney comes up,
and he asks you questions

01:11:50.014 --> 01:11:52.432
that are really meant
to benefit Whitey.

01:11:52.558 --> 01:11:54.726
Does that put you
in a strange position?

01:11:54.852 --> 01:11:56.686
The questions that Carney
was asking my mother,

01:11:56.854 --> 01:11:59.814
those are questions the government
should be asking my mother.

01:11:59.982 --> 01:12:03.985
Did you notice the government stood up
and blocked every question they asked.

01:12:04.111 --> 01:12:07.947
They don't want us to know anything.
lt was blunt, right there.

01:12:08.115 --> 01:12:09.949
Carney was asking questions
to help us,

01:12:10.117 --> 01:12:12.827
and we were getting blocked
by the prosecution.

01:12:12.995 --> 01:12:15.121
Where do we go here, folks?

01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:23.546
Kelly: ln the early 90s, when Fred and l
first started working on this case,

01:12:23.756 --> 01:12:29.260
it was strange to us, to say the least,
that this individual, Bulger,

01:12:29.470 --> 01:12:32.305
had been allowed to run amok
in the city of Boston for so long.

01:12:32.514 --> 01:12:35.850
We suspected, as did many
other people in law enforcement,

01:12:36.018 --> 01:12:39.395
that Bulger had some relationship
with the FBl

01:12:39.605 --> 01:12:41.230
that was...

01:12:41.398 --> 01:12:46.903
He was using to prevent
prosecution of himself.

01:12:47.071 --> 01:12:53.076
lt was in that atmosphere that we
began the case, and targeted him.

01:12:53.243 --> 01:12:57.580
And we worked with Tom Foley,
also Tom Duffy from the state police,

01:12:57.748 --> 01:12:59.665
who were very savvy investigators.

01:13:01.043 --> 01:13:04.212
So what we decided to do was follow
the money, and we started targeting

01:13:04.421 --> 01:13:08.966
a bottom line bookmaker
with some of the informants that we had.

01:13:09.093 --> 01:13:11.594
We put up a bunch of wiretaps,
and we started climbing up

01:13:11.762 --> 01:13:13.679
these bookmakers' organizations.

01:13:13.847 --> 01:13:17.266
We went from low to mid,
up to the higher level bookmaker,

01:13:17.476 --> 01:13:22.605
until we actually had the highest level,
where that bookmaker was doing

01:13:22.731 --> 01:13:26.901
the hand-off to Bulger and Flemmi
as far as payments go.

01:13:27.069 --> 01:13:31.280
lt took Brian and l about
four or five years to get there.

01:13:31.448 --> 01:13:36.160
By 1995, we had our first
racketeering indictment.

01:13:36.328 --> 01:13:40.039
Back then, Fred took a lot of
hits over the years,

01:13:40.207 --> 01:13:44.585
and we had the courage to go up
against the system, Brian Kelly too.

01:13:44.753 --> 01:13:50.216
There was many, right inside the US
Attorney's office, that were in denial,

01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:54.011
didn't want to see this
come forward. And they said,

01:13:54.179 --> 01:13:57.348
"Well, we're going to wait, we'll do
a joint investigation with the FBl."

01:13:57.516 --> 01:14:01.144
And l knew at that time
that this was another stall tactic.

01:14:01.311 --> 01:14:05.064
And l told them that, l said,
"Okay, if that's the way

01:14:05.232 --> 01:14:08.985
you want to go, but the state
police's position publicly

01:14:09.153 --> 01:14:13.406
will be you had the opportunity to
indict him and you didn't indict him."

01:14:13.574 --> 01:14:16.367
So, they went back and they had
another huddle with the US Attorney,

01:14:16.535 --> 01:14:20.163
and they said, "Okay, the indictment,
we will indict him."

01:14:20.372 --> 01:14:25.168
But they insisted that the FBl
participate in the arrest.

01:14:25.335 --> 01:14:30.173
So state police targeted Flemmi.
The FBl said they'll take Bulger.

01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:33.426
And then one night on January 5th,
we found Flemmi,

01:14:33.635 --> 01:14:37.263
and we arrested him
on the streets of Boston.

01:14:37.431 --> 01:14:42.518
And we arrested that same weekend,
John Martorano down in Florida.

01:14:42.686 --> 01:14:46.856
And we notified the FBl,
"Okay, grab Bulger."

01:14:47.024 --> 01:14:49.692
And, uh... that was the end of that.

01:14:50.569 --> 01:14:53.613
They never had Bulger,
didn't know where he was.

01:14:53.822 --> 01:14:58.493
And it was 16 years later before we
saw James Whitey Bulger again.

01:15:06.376 --> 01:15:09.879
We expected that he was tipped
off, and we found out later that

01:15:10.047 --> 01:15:15.176
that's what actually had happened.
One of the FBl agents in Boston

01:15:15.385 --> 01:15:18.387
told John Connolly that
the indictments were coming down,

01:15:18.555 --> 01:15:21.849
and he passed the information
along to Bulger.

01:15:24.561 --> 01:15:28.773
After months of sitting in jail,
Stephen Flemmi realized the FBl

01:15:28.982 --> 01:15:31.692
and John Connolly were not
coming to his rescue, and he

01:15:31.818 --> 01:15:35.947
and he decided to out himself
and Bulger's FBl informants.

01:15:37.324 --> 01:15:40.034
l'll never forget, when he
said he was an informant.

01:15:40.285 --> 01:15:43.204
l went up to visit him the next day,
or a day later, l said to him,

01:15:43.372 --> 01:15:46.999
l go, "Stevie, you're an informant,
you've been giving everybody up."

01:15:47.167 --> 01:15:51.629
And he said to me,
"Why should l do another day

01:15:51.838 --> 01:15:54.298
with all the information
l've given them people."

01:15:54.466 --> 01:15:56.676
l looked at him.
Now l'm like,

01:15:56.885 --> 01:15:58.761
"Okay, you know,
what's his next step?"

01:15:58.929 --> 01:16:01.639
You know, who's he got left
to give up?

01:16:01.807 --> 01:16:05.101
And he looked at me, he said, "Well,
we never said anything about you."

01:16:05.269 --> 01:16:08.271
So l was on the phone talking to him
through the glass.

01:16:08.397 --> 01:16:11.774
l took the phone and hung it up,
and l stood up, and l looked at him.

01:16:11.942 --> 01:16:14.485
l says, "You couldn't say anything
about me."

01:16:14.653 --> 01:16:18.406
l says, "Everything l did, l did with you."
l says, "You couldn't give me up

01:16:18.574 --> 01:16:19.949
without giving yourself up."

01:16:21.827 --> 01:16:25.288
Carney: Did you have any idea
that Flemmi was an informant

01:16:25.414 --> 01:16:28.833
until he revealed it
in a court hearing in 1999?

01:16:29.042 --> 01:16:33.129
Bulger: l didn't know that Stevie
did that there, l had no idea.

01:16:33.297 --> 01:16:35.423
And when l heard it,
l was shocked.

01:16:35.549 --> 01:16:37.258
l mean, Stevie was like my brother.

01:16:37.467 --> 01:16:41.304
l mean, l was so close to him.
He fooled me, he fooled the Mafia,

01:16:41.513 --> 01:16:44.682
he fooled Johnny, everybody.
l mean, l was shocked.

01:16:44.850 --> 01:16:47.685
l never believed he would ever do
anything like that.

01:16:47.853 --> 01:16:51.939
Did you ever have an instance
where Stevie provided

01:16:52.149 --> 01:16:54.400
some information in your presence?

01:16:54.568 --> 01:16:58.112
One time John Connolly asked him
a question and Stevie answered,

01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:01.824
he gave a name. When l heard that
l brought the thing to a close,

01:17:01.992 --> 01:17:03.701
and l told Steve, "C'mon, let's go."

01:17:03.869 --> 01:17:06.287
And l start hollering at him
as we went down the stairs,

01:17:06.413 --> 01:17:08.873
l told him,
"What the fuck did you do that for?"

01:17:09.082 --> 01:17:13.210
l says, "We're paying, we're not saying.
We're buying, we're not selling."

01:17:14.421 --> 01:17:17.048
Brennan: When Stephen Flemmi came out
and said he was an informant

01:17:17.257 --> 01:17:20.009
and was granted immunity,
the government wanted to shut him up,

01:17:20.218 --> 01:17:22.553
and John Connolly made the mistake
of coming in

01:17:22.721 --> 01:17:26.140
and taking Steve Flemmi's side and
saying, "We did give him immunity.

01:17:26.308 --> 01:17:30.436
The entire D.O.J. did it, you knew we were
doing it, that's what you told us to do.

01:17:30.604 --> 01:17:33.189
You paid us to do it,
you gave us bonuses to do it."

01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:35.816
At that point, the federal government
was either going to have to expose

01:17:36.026 --> 01:17:38.110
all the corruptness
in the federal government,

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:41.781
all the murders, or they have to say
that John Connolly is a liar.

01:17:43.158 --> 01:17:46.952
Man: John wouldn't play ball
with the prosecutors.

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:48.329
They then focused on John.

01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:51.457
"Oh, okay, you don't want to play
ball with us, we'll show you."

01:17:51.625 --> 01:17:53.542
And they then started
looking at John,

01:17:53.752 --> 01:17:55.628
and made a case against John.

01:17:56.254 --> 01:18:00.633
The government decided that the person
they really needed to get is Connolly,

01:18:00.842 --> 01:18:03.177
that's the case
they're trying to make.

01:18:03.428 --> 01:18:08.683
So John Martorano who had never met
John Connolly, never met him,

01:18:08.850 --> 01:18:13.229
goes to them and says, "l can link
John Connolly to the Wheeler murder.

01:18:13.438 --> 01:18:17.692
And l can link John Connolly
to the Callahan murder."

01:18:23.281 --> 01:18:27.451
Man: The defendant John Connolly,
he's just another member of the gang.

01:18:27.619 --> 01:18:30.413
They pay him money,
he gives them information.

01:18:30.622 --> 01:18:33.207
English: They arrive at the conclusion
that Martorano is gold

01:18:33.458 --> 01:18:36.252
as a witness and that he can
single-handedly help us

01:18:36.378 --> 01:18:40.506
put away John Connolly
and maybe Jimmy Bulger

01:18:40.716 --> 01:18:42.216
if Jimmy Bulger ever turns up.

01:18:42.384 --> 01:18:45.136
Man: Who did you believe you were
going to be protecting,

01:18:45.303 --> 01:18:47.304
by killing Callahan?

01:18:47.472 --> 01:18:50.766
l was protecting myself,
Whitey Bulger, Stevie Flemmi,

01:18:50.934 --> 01:18:52.476
and John Connolly.

01:18:52.602 --> 01:18:55.354
McDonald: They need John Connolly
to be the scapegoat.

01:18:55.522 --> 01:18:59.024
They've got to have
Connolly as the corrupt agent,

01:18:59.192 --> 01:19:02.111
with respect to all
of what went on in Boston,

01:19:02.279 --> 01:19:05.698
with respect to the top
echelon informant program,

01:19:05.866 --> 01:19:08.075
they have to have someone to blame.

01:19:08.243 --> 01:19:12.538
Why are you prosecuting Connolly
for the Callahan murder,

01:19:12.789 --> 01:19:14.874
when you know
the killer is Martorano,

01:19:15.041 --> 01:19:17.668
the guy who actually
pulled the trigger, for Pete's sake.

01:19:17.794 --> 01:19:19.754
But they convicted John Connolly,

01:19:19.963 --> 01:19:22.631
and then he was sentenced
for 40 years.

01:19:25.886 --> 01:19:30.139
Kelly: Martorano's plea agreement has
been roundly criticized for good reason.

01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:33.017
Most people think he should have
gotten more than 12 years,

01:19:33.185 --> 01:19:35.102
and we're no exception to that view.

01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:40.232
He is in fact a ruthless killer,
but at the time we had no evidence

01:19:40.484 --> 01:19:44.236
of his killing. And when he pled
guilty he not only got more time,

01:19:44.404 --> 01:19:49.575
but he also led to a series of events,
he made cooperation fashionable.

01:19:49.785 --> 01:19:51.994
Man: Mr. Weeks, if you will
come forward, please.

01:19:52.162 --> 01:19:56.290
l was arrested November 17, '99
and they were telling me

01:19:56.458 --> 01:20:00.044
what it came down to,
make it really quick and simple,

01:20:00.253 --> 01:20:02.046
is that it's a race.

01:20:02.214 --> 01:20:04.215
lt's either you or Stevie,
and you're going to get

01:20:04.382 --> 01:20:07.218
the last seat on the bus,
but whichever one of youse

01:20:07.344 --> 01:20:09.678
get up there first to make a deal
with the government

01:20:09.763 --> 01:20:11.388
is going to get the best deal.

01:20:13.099 --> 01:20:15.643
You know, what's Stevie gonna do?
Stevie's gonna give me up,

01:20:15.769 --> 01:20:17.645
and say it was Kevin, and it was
this one and it was that one

01:20:17.813 --> 01:20:19.647
that killed all these people,
it wasn't us.

01:20:19.773 --> 01:20:22.149
You know, here's the bodies.
That's where they put them and stuff.

01:20:22.359 --> 01:20:24.485
l said no, there's no way l'm
taking it up the ass for them.

01:20:24.653 --> 01:20:28.781
So l made the deal first.
l figured you can't rat on a rat.

01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:33.118
Kelly: Kevin Weeks, his plea was
a critical turning point in this case

01:20:33.286 --> 01:20:36.455
because he literally led us
to the bodies, he brought us

01:20:36.623 --> 01:20:40.626
to the burial grounds where we saw
for ourselves Bulger's handiwork.

01:20:41.962 --> 01:20:45.881
Carney: Kevin Weeks, five murders,
he does five years.

01:20:46.091 --> 01:20:50.970
John Martorano, for 20 murders
he got a sentence of 12 years,

01:20:51.096 --> 01:20:54.348
plus they let him keep money,
keep property.

01:20:54.474 --> 01:20:57.560
They got him a waiver of
the death penalty in Oklahoma,

01:20:57.686 --> 01:21:00.646
and a waiver of the death penalty
in Florida.

01:21:00.772 --> 01:21:04.817
They paid his commissary fees
while he was in prison,

01:21:04.985 --> 01:21:09.029
and when he got out,
gave him a $20,000 check.

01:21:09.239 --> 01:21:12.449
Man: A quarter of a million dollar
advance for selling the movie rights

01:21:12.659 --> 01:21:15.870
to his life story,
$110,000 or something advance

01:21:16.037 --> 01:21:17.413
for the book he co-wrote.

01:21:17.581 --> 01:21:20.708
- Man 2: The state calls John Morris.
- Man 3: John Morris, please.

01:21:20.876 --> 01:21:24.378
l would say the most scandalous deal
that the government made

01:21:24.504 --> 01:21:27.423
was with one of their own
and that was John Morris,

01:21:27.591 --> 01:21:30.718
who was John Connolly's
equally corrupt supervisor,

01:21:30.844 --> 01:21:36.140
and who got people killed,
and he got no time, nothing.

01:21:36.349 --> 01:21:39.143
John had told me
that these guys really like you

01:21:39.352 --> 01:21:44.023
and if you ever needed anything
to just ask.

01:21:44.232 --> 01:21:48.360
Man: John Morris is corrupt an FBl
official as one could possibly be,

01:21:48.486 --> 01:21:52.823
not a minute in jail.
He's a wine consultant now.

01:21:53.074 --> 01:21:58.871
l didn't want what happened to me
to happen to other agents.

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:02.291
Mr. Flemmi, if you'll stand up
and raise your right hand,

01:22:02.459 --> 01:22:03.834
Linda will swear you in.

01:22:04.002 --> 01:22:07.171
Flemmi wound up making his deal
when it was really too late

01:22:07.339 --> 01:22:10.633
to get a good deal, so he wound up
getting a life sentence,

01:22:10.884 --> 01:22:13.969
and now he's become kind of
a professional witness

01:22:14.137 --> 01:22:18.724
for the government, and he's just a
windup doll who says what he believes

01:22:18.892 --> 01:22:21.518
he needs to say so that
the government will give him

01:22:21.686 --> 01:22:25.731
better accommodations in prison,
they'll do little things for him

01:22:25.899 --> 01:22:28.192
that will make the fact that
he's spending the rest of his life

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:29.818
in prison a little more comfortable.

01:22:29.986 --> 01:22:32.905
He's a pathetic creation
of the system at this point.

01:22:33.073 --> 01:22:35.407
Carney: Do you see the defendant
Mr. Connolly in the courtroom?

01:22:35.575 --> 01:22:39.328
l see him, yes.
Good-looking gentleman,

01:22:39.496 --> 01:22:43.415
he's got a nice haircut.
l know him very well.

01:22:44.376 --> 01:22:47.127
English: These guys, they're all
violating the gangster code.

01:22:47.253 --> 01:22:51.465
They all became some version of
a rat by testifying against people.

01:22:51.591 --> 01:22:54.301
They've all had to reconcile it
in their conscience

01:22:54.469 --> 01:22:58.597
why they did this and they've
all created their little stories,

01:22:58.807 --> 01:23:03.560
their own internal fictions,
of why they've had to do what they do.

01:23:05.730 --> 01:23:08.732
Davis: The state of Massachusetts
has got more rats in it.

01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:14.697
lt's like an infested rat hole.
The lrish mob, every one of them,

01:23:14.864 --> 01:23:19.159
They were stumbling over each other
just to rat.

01:23:19.369 --> 01:23:24.164
They walk around talking big, tough guy
shit, and they're fucking rats.

01:23:24.332 --> 01:23:28.627
The federal court right here,
doesn't it look like a mouse hole?

01:23:28.753 --> 01:23:30.713
( laughing )

01:23:30.797 --> 01:23:32.631
- Man: Good for rats, right?
- Yeah.

01:23:32.841 --> 01:23:34.842
That's where all the rats go.

01:23:39.014 --> 01:23:43.058
Woman: lt was a tense reunion
18 years in the making.

01:23:43.226 --> 01:23:44.977
Finally, James Whitey Bulger

01:23:45.145 --> 01:23:48.188
and his partner Stephen
"The Rifleman" Flemmi were reunited

01:23:48.398 --> 01:23:50.649
as Flemmi took the stand
against Bulger.

01:23:50.817 --> 01:23:54.695
Man: Stephen Flemmi is considered to
be the most critical witness in this case.

01:23:54.863 --> 01:23:57.740
Woman 2: ln rapid-fire succession,
Flemmi described Bulger's

01:23:57.907 --> 01:24:01.368
alleged role in a string of killings
during the 1970s

01:24:01.536 --> 01:24:03.328
when both men were leaders
of the Winter Hill gang.

01:24:03.496 --> 01:24:06.874
Boeri: Flemmi is under pressure,
they're talking about women.

01:24:07.125 --> 01:24:11.503
Bulger is charged with strangling
Deborah Hussey and Debbie Davis.

01:24:11.713 --> 01:24:15.007
The defense is trying to suggest
in fact, it was Flemmi.

01:24:15.258 --> 01:24:17.593
Woman: Hank Brennan grilled
the government witness

01:24:17.761 --> 01:24:21.597
on his sexual relationship with his
then girlfriend's teenage daughter

01:24:21.765 --> 01:24:22.556
Deborah Hussey.

01:24:22.682 --> 01:24:25.726
Woman 2: Flemmi said Deborah Hussey
turned into a drug user

01:24:25.894 --> 01:24:28.145
and an embarrassment,
so they had to kill her.

01:24:29.230 --> 01:24:32.608
Man: At Bulger's trial Friday,
Flemmi said Bulger murdered

01:24:32.776 --> 01:24:35.819
Flemmi's girlfriend Deborah Davis
after the two men decided

01:24:35.945 --> 01:24:37.321
she knew too much.

01:24:37.489 --> 01:24:40.574
Woman: Flemmi claims Bulger
decided Davis had to be killed.

01:24:40.742 --> 01:24:44.328
"l couldn't do it," Flemmi testified.
He said Bulger said,

01:24:44.496 --> 01:24:47.372
"l'll take care of it, l'll do it."
He grabbed her around the throat,

01:24:47.540 --> 01:24:49.500
and strangled her.

01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:55.506
Davis: My sister, Debbie, she dated
Steve Flemmi for over nine years.

01:24:55.757 --> 01:24:58.550
He gave her cars,

01:24:58.676 --> 01:25:02.137
apartments, furniture, jewelry,

01:25:02.305 --> 01:25:04.890
but he would never give her cash.

01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:08.519
You know, he would give her
five, 10 bucks a day, and...

01:25:08.686 --> 01:25:09.937
Cheap prick.

01:25:10.396 --> 01:25:12.439
She loved him, she did love him.

01:25:12.607 --> 01:25:16.276
But at one point she wanted to
get married, she wanted kids.

01:25:16.444 --> 01:25:21.240
My sister wanted kids, and it was
just a rocky road from then on.

01:25:22.033 --> 01:25:24.785
She said, "l'm leaving him,
l'm leaving Steve."

01:25:24.953 --> 01:25:30.582
And l think Whitey
would've taken that as a threat.

01:25:30.708 --> 01:25:33.460
You know, her taking secrets
or whatever with her.

01:25:33.545 --> 01:25:36.255
Man: Flemmi became more
and more defensive,

01:25:36.381 --> 01:25:38.423
and more and more resistant
to the questions

01:25:38.591 --> 01:25:41.385
as Hank Brennan just cut into him.

01:25:41.511 --> 01:25:43.971
Brennan: Were you combining the two
different versions in your testimony

01:25:44.139 --> 01:25:47.724
in front of this jury to make amends
for your inconsistencies, Mr. Flemmi?

01:25:47.851 --> 01:25:50.144
Flemmi: No, it was just probably
an inadvertent mistake on my part.

01:25:50.311 --> 01:25:52.354
Brennan: Another inadvertent mistake
on this case?

01:25:52.522 --> 01:25:54.773
Man: Flemmi is a well-rehearsed
witness now

01:25:54.941 --> 01:25:58.026
because he's testified in three trials
and three civil proceedings.

01:25:58.111 --> 01:26:02.990
ln one court he says that Bulger
strangled her with a rope.

01:26:03.199 --> 01:26:07.077
ln another proceeding he said
he strangled her with his hands.

01:26:07.245 --> 01:26:10.789
And then, in a third proceeding,
he said he thought that Bulger

01:26:10.957 --> 01:26:12.583
had her in a headlock.

01:26:12.750 --> 01:26:15.210
So, at the end of the day,
the inconsistencies, yes,

01:26:15.378 --> 01:26:17.921
they're there, but do they
stop Bulger from being convicted?

01:26:18.089 --> 01:26:22.843
lt certainly does not look like
that is significant enough to do that.

01:26:24.637 --> 01:26:28.307
Carney: Two of the charges against
you, Jim, are that you were involved

01:26:28.558 --> 01:26:32.853
in the murder of
Deborah Hussey and Debbie Davis.

01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:35.772
Did you have any involvement
in those two cases at all?

01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:39.776
Bulger: No way. Those were
Stevie's girlfriends. That's his problem.

01:26:39.986 --> 01:26:42.654
lt had nothing
to do with me, nothing.

01:26:42.822 --> 01:26:47.034
Carney: Do you feel he was fully capable
of committing these by himself?

01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:51.330
Bulger: Christ. When one of the guys
asked him something about a murder,

01:26:51.497 --> 01:26:54.708
he says, well, he's been involved
in so fucking many murders

01:26:54.876 --> 01:26:58.003
he has to say to the guy
"Well, show me the list."

01:26:58.129 --> 01:27:01.590
He needed a list to show him
what murder you're talking about.

01:27:01.758 --> 01:27:06.053
l mean, this guy he is...
l think he's insane, myself, Stevie.

01:27:06.262 --> 01:27:08.889
ln the court he's glaring at me
and l'm looking at him thinking,

01:27:09.015 --> 01:27:11.600
"Christ, Stevie, you're looking at me.
l never said a word against you.

01:27:11.726 --> 01:27:14.311
l'm the injured party."

01:27:14.437 --> 01:27:18.190
But he was like a puppet
for Wyshak, you know.

01:27:19.567 --> 01:27:23.737
Cullen: Whitey Bulger cannot have people
think he murdered those two women.

01:27:23.863 --> 01:27:26.156
And he cannot have people
think he was an informant.

01:27:26.324 --> 01:27:28.116
This is not about getting acquitted,

01:27:28.243 --> 01:27:32.913
this is about changing the narrative
back to the one he spent years cultivating.

01:27:33.039 --> 01:27:35.999
And that narrative
is he is a good bad guy.

01:27:36.167 --> 01:27:40.545
He is a gangster with scruples.
He is a criminal with standards.

01:27:40.713 --> 01:27:44.341
And gangsters with scruples
do not murder women

01:27:44.467 --> 01:27:46.635
and bury them in shallow graves.

01:27:46.803 --> 01:27:50.222
And criminals with standards
don't turn on their friends.

01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:51.682
( sirens wailing )

01:27:51.849 --> 01:27:54.685
Woman: Today could end up being
an extremely interesting day

01:27:54.894 --> 01:27:56.061
at the trial of James Whitey Bulger.

01:27:56.187 --> 01:27:59.439
Woman 2: The big question is whether
or not Whitey himself will take the stand.

01:27:59.607 --> 01:28:01.650
Man: Will James Whitey Bulger
take the stand?

01:28:01.818 --> 01:28:04.027
Everybody's waiting on bated breath
to find out.

01:28:04.195 --> 01:28:06.154
Man 2: My prediction
is he will testify.

01:28:06.406 --> 01:28:08.532
He looks so bad if he doesn't.

01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:10.867
Today's a big day
at the end of the case,

01:28:11.035 --> 01:28:13.912
and l want to let him know that
we're with him and behind him

01:28:13.997 --> 01:28:16.373
no matter what decision he makes.
lf he wants to testify,

01:28:16.541 --> 01:28:19.251
then we're 100 percent behind it.

01:28:19.419 --> 01:28:22.087
lf he doesn't, then l
totally understand as well.

01:28:22.255 --> 01:28:26.800
Boeri: The defense was hoping
to present a defense of immunity,

01:28:26.968 --> 01:28:31.471
that Bulger had been given immunity
by the former US Attorney.

01:28:31.597 --> 01:28:34.349
But before the trial
they got the answer from this judge.

01:28:34.434 --> 01:28:37.185
No, they couldn't, they were
stripped of that defense.

01:28:37.353 --> 01:28:42.316
lt's an interesting argument,
but it is somewhat convenient

01:28:42.483 --> 01:28:46.528
to make the argument because
Jeremiah T. O'Sullivan is dead.

01:28:47.947 --> 01:28:53.243
And there is no written evidence
that we've seen.

01:28:53.411 --> 01:28:56.705
Man: ln courtroom 11 ,
a moment of high drama.

01:28:56.873 --> 01:28:59.499
Whitey's lawyer stood up and said,
"The defense rests."

01:28:59.667 --> 01:29:01.793
Woman: Carney says Bulger
will not take the stand.

01:29:01.961 --> 01:29:05.380
Man 2: When the judge asked if he
made that choice voluntarily,

01:29:05.548 --> 01:29:06.965
he stunned everyone.

01:29:07.133 --> 01:29:09.384
Man 3: "l'm making the choice
involuntarily," Bulger said.

01:29:09.552 --> 01:29:12.012
Woman: Because l feel that l've
been choked off from having

01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:14.973
an opportunity to give
an adequate defense and explain

01:29:15.141 --> 01:29:18.143
about my conversation and agreement
with Jeremiah O'Sullivan.

01:29:18.311 --> 01:29:21.480
Man 4: For my protection of his life,
in return he promised

01:29:21.773 --> 01:29:22.898
to give me immunity."

01:29:23.066 --> 01:29:26.777
Woman: And as Judge Casper said,
she already ruled Bulger's immunity claim

01:29:26.986 --> 01:29:29.112
was inadmissible,
he said defiantly,

01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:31.907
Man 5: "As far as l'm concerned,
l didn't get a fair trial

01:29:32.075 --> 01:29:33.784
and this is a sham."

01:29:33.951 --> 01:29:35.827
Man 6: "And do what youse
want with me.

01:29:35.995 --> 01:29:37.704
That's it.
That's my final word."

01:29:37.872 --> 01:29:41.291
Woman: At that point,
Patricia Donahue rose from her seat,

01:29:41.376 --> 01:29:43.877
and yelled, "You're a coward."

01:29:44.504 --> 01:29:49.132
l yelled out, "You're a coward,"
because that's what he is.

01:29:49.384 --> 01:29:52.928
This man first claims
that he has immunity,

01:29:53.012 --> 01:29:56.223
which he thinks gives him the right
to kill all these people.

01:29:56.432 --> 01:29:59.810
And now he blames an unfair trial

01:30:00.103 --> 01:30:03.772
on the Department of Justice.

01:30:04.524 --> 01:30:07.484
Yet he won't get
on the stand and tell all.

01:30:07.652 --> 01:30:10.028
lf you think that the government
has done wrong by you,

01:30:10.196 --> 01:30:12.906
then get up there and talk about it.

01:30:12.990 --> 01:30:14.282
No comments.

01:30:14.450 --> 01:30:17.285
- How do you feel about your chances?
- No comment.

01:30:17.453 --> 01:30:20.831
Kelly: At the end of the day,
Bulger's immunity claim

01:30:20.998 --> 01:30:24.251
was a ridiculous claim and when
he was given the chance to present it,

01:30:24.585 --> 01:30:30.549
he didn't. His immunity claims were
part of his game of let's pretend.

01:30:30.883 --> 01:30:35.804
Let's pretend l'm going to testify.
Let's pretend l have a license to kill.

01:30:35.930 --> 01:30:38.974
Let's pretend l'm not an informant.

01:30:41.686 --> 01:30:44.396
Brennan: So many people
have the opinion that,

01:30:44.522 --> 01:30:47.232
the idea of whether he was an informant
or not is irrelevant,

01:30:47.358 --> 01:30:50.694
and yet this is the central issue
in this case.

01:30:50.820 --> 01:30:53.363
The reason why the informant status
is important is for a couple of reasons.

01:30:53.573 --> 01:30:56.908
One, the government has an impression
to try and create for the public,

01:30:57.076 --> 01:31:01.204
they want to present a theory
of minimal amount of corruption

01:31:01.372 --> 01:31:05.375
that is quarantined with John Connolly,
based on a rogue agent theory

01:31:05.543 --> 01:31:10.964
and an improper handler who formed
a relationship with James Bulger.

01:31:11.132 --> 01:31:12.841
That's what they've been
trying to do for decades

01:31:12.967 --> 01:31:15.635
in every litigation they've had.
lt's not true.

01:31:15.845 --> 01:31:18.972
The truth is that James Bulger
was not an informant.

01:31:19.182 --> 01:31:21.933
And the reason why it's dangerous
for the Department of Justice

01:31:22.101 --> 01:31:24.352
to recognize the fact
that he wasn't an informant

01:31:24.562 --> 01:31:28.857
is that if Mr. Bulger was just paying
a dozen people on the FBl,

01:31:28.983 --> 01:31:31.902
as he was, and headquarters
didn't do anything about it,

01:31:32.028 --> 01:31:34.571
and the supervision wasn't there,
and they didn't do the yearly reports,

01:31:34.697 --> 01:31:37.449
they didn't do the yearly reviews,
it then calls into question

01:31:37.533 --> 01:31:39.993
all the affidavits that he's on.
lt calls into question

01:31:40.203 --> 01:31:43.705
all the convictions they had.
Think about the implications.

01:31:43.873 --> 01:31:46.124
Think about what happened
in the 1980s.

01:31:46.292 --> 01:31:50.629
The crown jewel of the Department
of Justice was to get the ltalian Mafia.

01:31:50.755 --> 01:31:54.841
They wanted to infiltrate
the headquarters of the Angiulo's

01:31:54.967 --> 01:31:57.886
on Prince Street in the north end.
They needed affidavits,

01:31:58.054 --> 01:32:00.931
And what did they do?
They used James Bulger's name

01:32:01.057 --> 01:32:03.683
even though we now know that he
didn't give them any information.

01:32:03.768 --> 01:32:07.687
Their own witnesses will admit that he
was simply added on to search warrants

01:32:07.772 --> 01:32:10.774
and affidavits as a courtesy
to John Connolly.

01:32:10.942 --> 01:32:12.859
So what would happen when
the federal government admits

01:32:12.985 --> 01:32:15.070
that he wasn't part
of these search warrants?

01:32:15.279 --> 01:32:19.366
Every attorney who represented every
mobster would sue the federal government.

01:32:19.492 --> 01:32:23.161
They lose all their convictions,
they lose all the jail time,

01:32:23.329 --> 01:32:26.540
and all the sentences.
All these accolades

01:32:26.624 --> 01:32:29.626
that attorneys and lawyers
and FBl agents earned,

01:32:29.752 --> 01:32:32.462
their reputations they earned,
would be gone.

01:32:32.547 --> 01:32:36.883
They're not going to give that up,
and probably most importantly,

01:32:37.009 --> 01:32:39.010
is the civil liability
to the families.

01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:42.055
That's why you have this
resounding unrest with the

01:32:42.223 --> 01:32:45.016
with the families.
They've lost loved ones

01:32:45.142 --> 01:32:49.187
and at some point there has to be closure.
They are entitled to closure as citizens.

01:32:49.355 --> 01:32:51.815
This government will give them
no closure because they have

01:32:51.983 --> 01:32:54.734
this pretense they have to keep for
their own image that James Bulger

01:32:54.902 --> 01:32:56.987
is an informant rather
than saying we sanctioned this,

01:32:57.154 --> 01:33:00.031
not just with James Bulger,
we sanctioned organized crime figures

01:33:00.199 --> 01:33:02.826
to go out and kill.
And we protected them

01:33:03.035 --> 01:33:05.287
and we did it before, we did it here,
and we're going to do it again,

01:33:05.413 --> 01:33:07.664
we have done it again.
They can't admit that.

01:33:07.832 --> 01:33:10.375
So these families suffer over
and over and over again

01:33:10.459 --> 01:33:13.837
with never getting the answer.
Are they going to overturn convictions

01:33:14.005 --> 01:33:16.506
and let everybody go?
Are they going to be civilly liable

01:33:16.674 --> 01:33:19.217
for their lies? Are they going to
prosecute themselves?

01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:23.388
lt's never going to happen.
So he has to be an informant.

01:33:31.355 --> 01:33:36.192
Woman: Prosecutors and defense attorneys
for Boston mobster James Whitey Bulger

01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:39.446
get their last chances today
to try to persuade jurors

01:33:39.655 --> 01:33:42.198
in Bulger's murder
and racketeering trial.

01:33:42.366 --> 01:33:44.784
WBUR's David Boeri joins us
this morning. Good morning.

01:33:44.952 --> 01:33:45.702
Good morning, Deb.

01:33:45.870 --> 01:33:50.040
Okay, now both sides get three hours
to sum up their cases.

01:33:50.207 --> 01:33:51.458
What are they going to do
with all that time?

01:33:51.626 --> 01:33:54.336
An extraordinary amount
of time, that's for sure.

01:33:54.503 --> 01:33:57.547
And, as a matter of fact, the government
said it needed more time.

01:33:58.591 --> 01:34:02.010
Wyshak: James Bulger is one of
the most vicious, violent,

01:34:02.219 --> 01:34:05.555
and calculating criminals ever to
walk the streets of Boston.

01:34:05.723 --> 01:34:10.185
lt doesn't matter whether or not
Mr. Bulger was an FBl informant.

01:34:10.394 --> 01:34:14.481
Whether he's an FBl informant or not,
he's guilty of murder.

01:34:14.649 --> 01:34:16.650
Carney: There are three witnesses
to the murders,

01:34:16.734 --> 01:34:19.194
Martorano, Weeks, Flemmi.

01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:22.405
What l submit to you is
the critical issue in this case,

01:34:22.573 --> 01:34:25.950
whether you can believe
Martorano, Weeks, and Flemmi

01:34:26.118 --> 01:34:28.495
beyond a reasonable doubt.

01:34:28.663 --> 01:34:32.332
Wyshak: This trial is not about
whether or not the FBl in Boston

01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:35.960
was a mess. lt's not a referendum
on whether or not Kevin Weeks

01:34:36.212 --> 01:34:39.964
and John Martorano should be spending
the rest of their lives in jail.

01:34:40.091 --> 01:34:43.093
lt's about whether or not
the defendant is guilty of the crimes

01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:46.179
charged in the indictment.
He's the one on trial here,

01:34:46.347 --> 01:34:50.350
not the government,
not the FBl, James Bulger.

01:34:50.518 --> 01:34:53.603
Brennan: We think about our
government as this institution,

01:34:53.729 --> 01:34:57.107
this faceless organization.
Our government is not them,

01:34:57.274 --> 01:35:00.527
our government is us.
At what point as citizens do we say,

01:35:00.736 --> 01:35:04.406
"You know what,
there has to be accountability?"

01:35:04.573 --> 01:35:06.741
You tell them that.

01:35:09.745 --> 01:35:14.582
Boeri: l've been on this story
for so long, and l've never seen

01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:17.627
such depravity in a courtroom.

01:35:17.837 --> 01:35:22.882
We have a situation where
an institution of the government

01:35:23.050 --> 01:35:27.470
decided that in order
to achieve a goal,

01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:30.724
which was questionable at best,
they decided who was going to live,

01:35:30.933 --> 01:35:32.976
and they decided
who was going to die.

01:35:33.102 --> 01:35:37.772
And they empowered those people
that were carrying out terror,

01:35:37.940 --> 01:35:40.692
they empowered them,
they gave them the run of the city.

01:35:40.860 --> 01:35:43.903
That was lawlessness
by the government.

01:35:44.113 --> 01:35:46.698
That is what we can never forget,

01:35:46.949 --> 01:35:48.783
and that's why...

01:35:51.954 --> 01:35:56.040
That's why l'm proud
to have done this story.

01:35:58.127 --> 01:36:01.379
Because it's just, it's something
you can't forget.

01:36:01.547 --> 01:36:03.965
And memory is really important.

01:36:04.133 --> 01:36:06.593
You know, memory is a political act,
and l think as reporters

01:36:06.802 --> 01:36:09.846
you got to keep the memory,
even if other people aren't.

01:36:15.019 --> 01:36:18.855
Woman: The United States
v. James J. Bulger is over.

01:36:19.023 --> 01:36:20.982
Man: This trial's been going on
for two months.

01:36:21.150 --> 01:36:22.859
This jury has been deliberating
the last five days.

01:36:23.068 --> 01:36:26.279
Woman: The jury has made a decision
in this case and we are waiting

01:36:26.447 --> 01:36:28.490
to see exactly what it is.

01:36:28.574 --> 01:36:32.952
Man: Whitey Bulger faces possible
maximum life in prison,

01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:36.539
we say the caveat, this man
is 83 years of age.

01:36:36.707 --> 01:36:38.583
Woman 2: Bulger is standing right now
in the courtroom

01:36:38.751 --> 01:36:43.963
as he hears the words to count one
for racketeering conspiracy: guilty.

01:36:44.048 --> 01:36:47.467
Woman 3: For count two, we're just
waiting here for word out of the courtroom,

01:36:47.635 --> 01:36:50.929
that it is a guilty verdict as well
on count two.

01:36:51.096 --> 01:36:53.556
Now within the second one
were all of these acts,

01:36:53.682 --> 01:36:57.352
that include all of the acts of murder.
Racketeering act number one,

01:36:57.520 --> 01:36:58.686
that was not proven.

01:36:58.854 --> 01:37:02.482
Man: For racketeering act number two
we're hearing that is not proved.

01:37:02.608 --> 01:37:04.442
Racketeering act number three,
not proved.

01:37:04.610 --> 01:37:08.822
Number four, not proved.
Five, not proved.

01:37:08.948 --> 01:37:10.907
Woman: Narcotics
distribution conspiracy.

01:37:11.075 --> 01:37:12.200
Man 2: That is proved.

01:37:12.368 --> 01:37:15.245
Woman: The extortion of Stephen
Stippo Rakes and Julie Rakes.

01:37:15.412 --> 01:37:17.288
Man: We're waiting on this.
That is proved.

01:37:17.456 --> 01:37:20.458
Man 2: The conspiracy to murder
Roger Wheeler: proved.

01:37:20.626 --> 01:37:23.419
Man 3: The murder of John Callahan
is also proved.

01:37:23.587 --> 01:37:26.339
Man 4: Next the murder
of Brian Halloran: proved.

01:37:26.507 --> 01:37:28.091
Woman: Then we have the murder
of Michael Donahue.

01:37:28.259 --> 01:37:29.467
Man: Proved.

01:37:29.593 --> 01:37:30.802
Murder of Deborah Hussey.

01:37:30.970 --> 01:37:32.262
Man 2: Proved.

01:37:32.429 --> 01:37:34.180
Woman: The next one,
very important for Stephen Davis,

01:37:34.348 --> 01:37:37.058
the murder of Deborah Davis,
no finding.

01:37:38.727 --> 01:37:41.980
Man: Whitey Bulger was convicted
on 31 out of 32 counts

01:37:42.106 --> 01:37:44.732
of racketeering, conspiracy,
murder, extortion,

01:37:44.900 --> 01:37:46.025
and other charges.

01:37:46.193 --> 01:37:48.528
Woman: But the jury found that
the government only proved

01:37:48.654 --> 01:37:52.365
the murders of 11 of Bulger's
19 alleged victims.

01:37:52.533 --> 01:37:55.660
Alright, let's just do
the jury convicted Bulger of...

01:37:55.870 --> 01:37:58.538
lt's 31 , they acquitted him
of one count.

01:37:58.706 --> 01:38:03.209
With the conviction of James Bulger,
we hope that we stand here today

01:38:03.377 --> 01:38:06.087
to mark the end of an era
that was very ugly

01:38:06.297 --> 01:38:08.214
in Boston's history.

01:38:08.382 --> 01:38:11.968
English: As theater,
the trial delivered, but ultimately

01:38:12.136 --> 01:38:15.805
it was a disappointment to me.
Those of us journalists,

01:38:15.890 --> 01:38:20.518
interested parties who've been following
the Bulger story for decades,

01:38:20.686 --> 01:38:24.939
we kind of hoped this trial
would be a final accounting

01:38:25.190 --> 01:38:28.776
of the Bulger era, of all the things
that made Bulger possible.

01:38:28.944 --> 01:38:31.946
l think it fell far short in that regard.

01:38:32.114 --> 01:38:35.825
This case let people know that
no matter how politically connected

01:38:36.076 --> 01:38:40.914
one is, or how one may have
ins with law enforcement,

01:38:41.081 --> 01:38:44.375
it doesn't stop us
from prosecuting you.

01:38:44.543 --> 01:38:48.880
And, in fact, Bulger's reign of terror
was only brought to an end

01:38:49.089 --> 01:38:53.343
because they were honest members
of law enforcement who persisted,

01:38:53.469 --> 01:38:57.180
and who were not deterred by less
than honest members of law enforcement.

01:38:57.264 --> 01:39:02.769
And as a result, an awful and evil man
is going to jail for the rest of his life.

01:39:05.189 --> 01:39:08.775
Bulger: Jesus Christ almighty,
this is baloney

01:39:08.901 --> 01:39:13.404
and that's why l says "This is a sham trial."
l think the feds have the green light,

01:39:13.572 --> 01:39:16.824
nobody ever checks on them,
the media is not there,

01:39:16.992 --> 01:39:19.577
like they would like the public
to believe they are.

01:39:19.745 --> 01:39:24.457
These reporters are hand fed stuff from
FBl agents, then they write crime stories.

01:39:24.625 --> 01:39:27.752
They write books and everything else,
they're hand and fist with them.

01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:30.213
The one thing they all know is it works.

01:39:30.339 --> 01:39:34.759
lt works, it gets convictions.
There's no lessons learned.

01:39:34.927 --> 01:39:37.929
You can't get a fair trial,
you can't get a fair hearing.

01:39:38.097 --> 01:39:42.600
This system here, it isn't gonna change,
it isn't gonna change,

01:39:42.810 --> 01:39:44.352
it'll never change.

01:39:46.397 --> 01:39:50.733
Whitey Bulger is a vicious,
venal murderer.

01:39:50.901 --> 01:39:56.823
But he was enabled by the FBl.
And the FBl was enabled

01:39:56.949 --> 01:40:00.493
by the Justice Department.
And to this day, the Justice Department,

01:40:00.619 --> 01:40:05.039
as far as l'm concerned, was engaged
in a cover-up to minimize the extent

01:40:05.207 --> 01:40:08.084
of FBl corruption.
There were a dozen guys

01:40:08.252 --> 01:40:10.837
you could have made cases against.
The idea that John Connolly

01:40:11.046 --> 01:40:13.840
is the only guy convicted in this,
is a joke.

01:40:16.093 --> 01:40:20.179
To know that this is how you're
treated as an American citizen,

01:40:20.305 --> 01:40:26.185
when FBl agents protect killers and
come and take your loved one's life.

01:40:27.688 --> 01:40:30.023
You could be sitting here.

01:40:30.065 --> 01:40:32.400
Don't you want to know
what really went on?

01:40:32.568 --> 01:40:34.235
Why they really did it?

01:40:35.988 --> 01:40:39.115
Weeks: lf everybody told the truth,
everything would come together.

01:40:39.241 --> 01:40:42.827
But everybody fashions things to
benefit themselves, which is,

01:40:43.037 --> 01:40:46.039
which is natural, l guess.
But everybody is trying to

01:40:46.165 --> 01:40:48.875
twist the story a little bit.
No one's really going to know the truth

01:40:49.001 --> 01:40:52.003
until everybody starts telling the truth.
That's what it comes down to.

01:40:52.129 --> 01:40:54.213
People are going to have to
come to their own conclusions.

01:40:54.381 --> 01:40:56.007
You know, there's going to be
people out there that believe

01:40:56.175 --> 01:40:58.092
that Jim Bulger was an informant.
There's going to be

01:40:58.218 --> 01:41:00.178
people on the other side that
say he wasn't an informant.

01:41:00.345 --> 01:41:02.638
People are going to say he
didn't murder women.

01:41:02.806 --> 01:41:04.682
Other people will say
he did murder women.

01:41:04.808 --> 01:41:06.976
So the true story
will never be known.

01:41:11.732 --> 01:41:13.566
Today was a good day
for a lot of families,

01:41:13.734 --> 01:41:16.527
but today also wasn't a good day
for a lot of families.

01:41:16.695 --> 01:41:19.572
My heart goes out to them and l would
like to do a cheers for them,

01:41:19.656 --> 01:41:20.865
and we will not forget you.

01:41:21.033 --> 01:41:22.033
( applause )

01:41:22.159 --> 01:41:24.202
One person who
should be here,

01:41:24.369 --> 01:41:26.788
how about we give a nice cheers
to Stevie Rakes.

01:41:31.168 --> 01:41:33.211
Rakes: Yes,
l hold the FBl responsible.

01:41:33.378 --> 01:41:37.006
Good God, they protected this man,
now, you know, years later we find out

01:41:37.174 --> 01:41:39.550
everything that he's been doing
and getting away with it.

01:41:39.718 --> 01:41:43.387
Listen, it takes a, it takes
a village to raise a child.

01:41:43.555 --> 01:41:46.432
For all the destruction that this
Bulger and Flemmi have done,

01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:49.352
it would take a battalion
to cover it up.

01:41:49.478 --> 01:41:51.604
So where are they all?
