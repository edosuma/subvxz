WEBVTT

00:01.294 --> 00:03.660
Previously on Farscape.

00:03.671 --> 00:05.377
Katratzi.

00:05.381 --> 00:07.838
It's the name of a place. The
place where they took Aeryn.

00:07.842 --> 00:11.630
I gave you a chance.
Where is Crichton?

00:11.637 --> 00:13.423
Katratzi.

00:13.431 --> 00:15.717
That's the name of the base.
Where is it?

00:15.725 --> 00:23.143
Disguises its presence by
mirroring the orbit of one
of the moons of Tralask.

00:23.149 --> 00:24.434
I know that planet.

00:24.442 --> 00:27.479
The female is pregnant.
Her fetus must be saved.

00:27.486 --> 00:30.273
Is there a suitable recipient
for transplant?

00:30.281 --> 00:31.066
Please...

00:31.073 --> 00:32.404
( screaming )

00:32.408 --> 00:33.989
What about Scorpius?
-What about him?

00:33.993 --> 00:36.450
Well, he might have
been captured.
-Or killed.

00:38.915 --> 00:41.201
Harvey? You're not dead.

00:41.209 --> 00:43.245
lam the undead.

00:43.252 --> 00:44.412
That's not funny.

00:44.420 --> 00:46.376
Scorpius knows
everything you know.

00:46.380 --> 00:49.213
Memories, thoughts, dreams.

00:49.967 --> 00:51.423
Wormhole technology.

00:51.427 --> 00:52.928
No! No.

00:52.929 --> 00:56.513
You must go back for him.

00:57.767 --> 01:01.100
And now on Farscape.

01:01.103 --> 01:03.480
Minister Ahkna:
Where does it hurt, Scorpius?

01:03.481 --> 01:04.846
Here?

01:08.069 --> 01:09.309
Or here?

01:09.320 --> 01:11.402
(groaning)

01:13.366 --> 01:17.405
(gasping)

01:17.411 --> 01:21.700
Tell me what you know
about wormholes, hmm?

01:21.707 --> 01:27.748
Even the smallest secret,
and I'll leave you in
peace for an em.

01:27.755 --> 01:30.872
I've been searching my whole
life for a female like you.

01:30.883 --> 01:32.419
(trilling tongue)

01:34.303 --> 01:36.760
( screaming )

01:41.602 --> 01:43.217
This is madness.

01:43.229 --> 01:44.594
Could be genius, Sparky.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.516
You know, there's a very fine
line between the two.

01:46.524 --> 01:48.435
Geniuses make plans.

01:48.442 --> 01:51.684
We're going to walk into the
most heavily guarded base
in the Scarran Empire,

01:51.696 --> 01:54.403
start a civil war and
walk out with Scorpius.

01:54.407 --> 01:55.943
What part of that do you
not understand?

01:55.950 --> 01:58.692
How you two can possibly
believe it'll work.

01:58.703 --> 02:00.659
D'Argo:
We've been spotted.

02:02.581 --> 02:04.663
Scarran Flight Controller:
Ko-nach! Ko-nach ketl

02:04.667 --> 02:10.503
Sikozu:
Nach-ca vay-taf ver-ee yay-ret!
John Crichton, lll-ka doz-ka-vet.

02:10.506 --> 02:11.712
Chiana:
What did you just say?

02:11.716 --> 02:13.297
Can't you ever listen
to the plans?

02:13.301 --> 02:15.417
I told them that we're
escorting John Crichton,

02:15.428 --> 02:17.589
and he wants to join
the negotiations.

02:17.596 --> 02:20.463
Oh, great. Now they're
guaranteed to blow
us to hezmana.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.635
(Aeryn whispering ):
Keep it down!

02:22.643 --> 02:24.679
Scarran Flight Contoller:
ln noch het-za tye-um.

02:27.523 --> 02:29.059
That's it. I need it now.

02:29.066 --> 02:31.022
Rygel:
It's not too late to
change our minds.

02:31.027 --> 02:32.892
Thank you.
-That's true.

02:32.903 --> 02:35.110
But we just passed the
Jenek freighter,

02:35.114 --> 02:37.821
which means that Scorpius
is probably nearby.

02:37.825 --> 02:38.484
That's it?

02:43.080 --> 02:44.536
That's it.

02:46.500 --> 02:49.913
Mankind's greatest contribution
to the absurd.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.002
A thermonuclear bomb.

02:52.006 --> 02:53.871
(ticking and whirring softly)

03:01.057 --> 03:04.970
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

03:04.977 --> 03:08.595
Three years ago I got shot
through a wormhole.

03:08.606 --> 03:10.471
I'm in a distant part
of the universe

03:10.483 --> 03:13.771
aboard this living ship of
escaped prisoners,

03:13.778 --> 03:15.518
my friends.

03:16.614 --> 03:18.479
I've made enemies.

03:18.491 --> 03:21.824
Powerful, dangerous.

03:21.827 --> 03:25.661
Now all I want is to
find a way home

03:25.664 --> 03:28.497
to warn Earth.

03:28.501 --> 03:32.540
Look upward and share
the wonders I've seen.

04:09.125 --> 04:11.286
Grayza:
Emperor Staleek.

04:11.293 --> 04:14.751
Despite what your Minister
of War might believe,

04:14.755 --> 04:18.589
this offer of peace is genuine.

04:18.592 --> 04:21.755
Every day you fail to
take it seriously,

04:21.762 --> 04:25.596
we build more and more
wormhole weapons.

04:25.599 --> 04:29.763
Soon, the urge to use one will
become irresistible.

04:29.770 --> 04:32.853
Staleek:
Not to interrupt your bluster,

04:32.857 --> 04:37.146
but we have a guest who
should make these talks
even more amusing.

04:38.863 --> 04:40.524
John Crichton.

04:40.531 --> 04:41.646
And partner. What did we miss?

04:41.657 --> 04:44.694
You've taken a great risk
coming here.

04:44.702 --> 04:47.660
Why shouldn't I just have
you seized right now?

04:47.663 --> 04:49.369
Well, maybe this.

04:51.292 --> 04:54.204
What's that?

04:54.211 --> 04:58.671
Plutonium core, tritium shell.
Does that translate?

04:58.674 --> 05:00.005
A fission bomb.

05:00.009 --> 05:01.169
( snorting )

05:01.177 --> 05:02.633
Put those down!

05:02.636 --> 05:04.627
Crichton:
Nice threads.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.754
You must be the Emperor.

05:06.765 --> 05:10.178
Now, before anybody decides
to get clever,

05:10.186 --> 05:14.225
you should know I have multiple
deadman's sensors from every
culture on my ship

05:14.231 --> 05:17.268
and a few cultures
I haven't heard of.

05:17.943 --> 05:20.195
My heart stops,

05:20.196 --> 05:21.982
we all go boom.

05:23.199 --> 05:25.815
My heart speeds up,
it's boom again.

05:25.826 --> 05:30.911
Too hot, too cold,
too happy, too sad,

05:30.915 --> 05:33.782
thirsty, hungry, bored,

05:33.792 --> 05:36.044
it's John Lee Hooker time.

05:36.045 --> 05:37.785
Boom, boom, boom.

05:37.796 --> 05:40.708
And you try your little
psychic trick,

05:40.716 --> 05:43.002
kaboom.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.841
And we're all pushing up
day-glo daisies.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.927
Why do I doubt that?

05:47.765 --> 05:50.848
Because you lack imagination?

05:50.851 --> 05:51.681
What do you want?

05:55.231 --> 05:58.894
What do I... want?

05:59.693 --> 06:01.900
What do I want?

06:01.904 --> 06:07.820
I have not been chasing my ass
all over the galaxy, trying to
pull out chunks of my brain.

06:07.826 --> 06:15.369
I have not been sneaking
fembots and Skreeths into the
places where I live.

06:15.376 --> 06:17.162
You want something.

06:18.963 --> 06:19.668
You.

06:21.674 --> 06:25.667
You want what's inside my head.

06:25.678 --> 06:29.842
You want what I know
about wormholes.

06:29.848 --> 06:36.014
Because I can leap tall
galaxies in a single bound.

06:36.021 --> 06:39.764
I can scorch planets with
a wave of my hand,

06:39.775 --> 06:44.690
and you, and you... and you?

06:45.739 --> 06:47.775
You can't do jack.

06:47.783 --> 06:51.025
That's not true.

06:51.036 --> 06:54.028
Oh, really?

06:54.039 --> 06:57.702
You command the stars
to do your bidding?

06:57.710 --> 06:59.996
I know you can't.

07:00.004 --> 07:02.746
And you can't.

07:04.425 --> 07:06.916
And you won't.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.543
But I have.

07:09.555 --> 07:11.796
Staleek:
Then why are you here?

07:13.851 --> 07:18.220
Because I am an American.

07:19.440 --> 07:22.352
And what does an American want?

07:22.359 --> 07:23.940
Democracy?

07:24.945 --> 07:26.446
Capitalism!

07:26.447 --> 07:30.736
I want to sell out
and settle down.

07:30.743 --> 07:34.531
For one day only, it's a blue
light special on aisle three.

07:34.538 --> 07:36.904
My wormhole technology,

07:36.915 --> 07:39.907
and a free set of steak knives,

07:39.918 --> 07:43.786
for all the tea in China.

07:43.797 --> 07:49.167
And anything you can
imagine to pay me.

07:49.178 --> 07:50.088
Pay?

07:50.095 --> 07:52.472
Yes, pay.

07:52.473 --> 07:53.758
Cash.

07:53.766 --> 07:54.972
He's crazy.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.966
Isn't it fun?

08:03.942 --> 08:07.855
Welcome to my cold war.

08:07.863 --> 08:11.822
Now, what am I offered for all
the powers of the universe?

08:15.829 --> 08:17.365
I think Crichton's bluffing.

08:17.373 --> 08:19.830
The bomb isn't real, and
he has nothing to give us.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.085
He's come for Scorpius.

08:22.086 --> 08:24.919
We know they're working
together. At the Border
Station, the two of them...

08:24.922 --> 08:30.212
Get me a full analysis of
Crichton's weapon, and
how to disarm it.

08:35.099 --> 08:39.684
Why would Crichton risk so much
just to rescue an ally?

08:39.687 --> 08:41.803
He may be in league with
Commandant Grayza,

08:41.814 --> 08:44.430
to prevent Scorpius from giving
us wormhole technology.

08:44.441 --> 08:48.150
Ridiculous.
-It was Crichton's females
who rescued Grayza.

08:48.153 --> 08:50.109
From your clumsy attempt
to abduct her.

08:50.114 --> 08:52.821
Oh!
-Another one of your failures,

08:52.825 --> 08:54.781
Minister Ahkna.

08:58.706 --> 09:00.947
Lovely of them to invite us in.

09:00.958 --> 09:03.370
They did not have much of
a choice, did they?

09:03.377 --> 09:06.289
Well, I think we've located all
of the surveillance devices.

09:06.296 --> 09:09.163
Pilot's enhanced the encryption
so Comms should be secure.

09:09.174 --> 09:13.964
Anyone have any problems, phone
home, Fat Man and I will
throw our weight around.

09:13.971 --> 09:15.677
You all know the plan.

09:15.681 --> 09:17.922
Ooh. Uh, no, refresh me.

09:17.933 --> 09:19.264
Wrinkles.
-Yes?

09:19.268 --> 09:20.508
Charrids.

09:20.519 --> 09:21.975
Mmm.

09:21.979 --> 09:23.310
Kalish.

09:23.939 --> 09:25.930
Recon.

09:25.941 --> 09:27.397
Peacekeepers!

09:34.575 --> 09:39.035
Aeryn:
A peace conference with the
Emperor. Very brave of you to enter Scarran space.

09:39.037 --> 09:40.698
Could say the same for you.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.710
John Crichton.

09:48.714 --> 09:51.797
Do not destroy the
Sebacean people.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.007
You don't need me for that.

09:54.011 --> 09:56.047
You're doing a great
job on your own.

09:56.054 --> 10:01.139
Everything that I have done has
been calculated to gain peace.

10:01.143 --> 10:03.680
So you betray the Luxans?

10:03.687 --> 10:05.894
Maybe you should
check your math.

10:05.898 --> 10:12.485
Give us wormhole weapons
and everyone will be safe.

10:12.488 --> 10:14.854
Didn't she say she
already had that?

10:14.865 --> 10:16.526
Mmm.

10:16.533 --> 10:21.277
We are very, very close.

10:21.288 --> 10:25.531
You know that we have sent
Prowlers into wormholes.

10:25.542 --> 10:29.751
If I can buy peace,
even for an am or two,

10:30.506 --> 10:31.962
perhaps we can develop them.

10:36.553 --> 10:39.010
And what will you do?

10:39.014 --> 10:40.970
Kill billions of your rivals?

10:40.974 --> 10:42.965
Hey, maybe kill us.

10:47.022 --> 10:49.729
Then name your price, Crichton.

10:49.733 --> 10:52.475
Anything that you can imagine.

10:52.486 --> 10:55.978
Aye... there's the rub.

10:57.282 --> 10:59.568
You see...

10:59.576 --> 11:03.034
I can't figure a way out
of this situation.

11:03.038 --> 11:06.622
But the first side that does...

11:09.086 --> 11:10.326
wins.

11:13.215 --> 11:15.752
I'm to allow them
onto their ship?

11:15.759 --> 11:17.465
If they wish.

11:17.469 --> 11:21.712
Crichton and his crew have
negotiated full access
to all common areas,

11:21.723 --> 11:24.430
and we will acquiesce,

11:24.434 --> 11:26.425
for the time being.

11:26.436 --> 11:27.016
Ah.

11:30.148 --> 11:31.012
Hey.

11:33.068 --> 11:35.150
Let me ask you something.

11:35.153 --> 11:38.737
You short-faced Scarrans,
you all look alike, ya know?

11:39.867 --> 11:42.028
But, uh, were you...

11:42.035 --> 11:44.902
were you, uh, down...
down on the Border Station?

11:45.664 --> 11:47.404
Yes.

11:47.416 --> 11:49.281
Then you were the one that, uh

11:49.293 --> 11:52.376
that ordered Aeryn and me
to be cut open.

11:52.379 --> 11:53.994
(chuckling)

11:54.673 --> 11:56.038
Yeah.

11:57.009 --> 11:59.500
I got another one for you.

11:59.511 --> 12:02.423
Do Scarrans have mivonks?

12:02.431 --> 12:04.763
(grunting, then squealing)

12:06.351 --> 12:08.137
Yes...

12:08.145 --> 12:10.636
but they're not external.

12:13.400 --> 12:18.986
Because the Kalish had no idea
'cause he's a frelling hapooda!

12:18.989 --> 12:21.196
(both laughing)

12:26.872 --> 12:30.456
Ah, don't you Charrids
ever bathe?

12:32.127 --> 12:34.038
Listen, uh,

12:34.046 --> 12:38.460
the Scarrans have nothing
decent to drink, and I won't
drink with the Kalish.

12:39.551 --> 12:41.132
Got any raslak?

12:42.763 --> 12:44.128
Sit down.

12:44.139 --> 12:46.050
Thank you.

13:03.033 --> 13:05.866
Secretary Vakali?

13:05.869 --> 13:08.360
What are you doing here?
This is a restricted area.

13:08.372 --> 13:10.363
I have urgent information.

13:10.374 --> 13:15.585
I believe the Charrids are
trying to expel the Kalish
from Katratzi by force.

13:15.587 --> 13:19.421
And who are you to possess such
erroneous intelligence?

13:19.424 --> 13:22.712
Just like you, I am a
devoted Kalish.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.675
Without us to administer
their empire,

13:24.680 --> 13:27.046
the Scarran system of
governance will collapse.

13:27.057 --> 13:30.174
What if they fear you will
take it away from them?

13:33.355 --> 13:35.186
Please.

13:35.190 --> 13:39.149
Please, Secretary,
we need to talk.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.187
Sir,

13:40.195 --> 13:42.311
you're too prominent to
be seen with her.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.358
I will speak to her.

13:46.785 --> 13:49.026
Ah...

13:49.037 --> 13:50.823
Oh... (coughs)

13:50.831 --> 13:53.322
That is terrible.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.244
Even the Scarrans should
treat you better.

13:55.252 --> 13:57.584
What do you want, Luxan?

13:57.587 --> 14:00.875
Me? I've got what I want.

14:00.882 --> 14:02.543
Oh?

14:02.551 --> 14:08.262
You enjoy traveling with
a group of thieves and
a Hynerian slug?

14:08.265 --> 14:10.096
(laughing)

14:10.100 --> 14:12.307
You would, too, if you were
being paid what I'm being paid.

14:12.310 --> 14:14.141
Which is what?

14:14.146 --> 14:17.229
I think you better take that
up with my employer.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.188
What's this?

14:22.195 --> 14:23.275
Dinner?

14:23.280 --> 14:25.316
( laughter)

14:25.323 --> 14:27.735
"This" is opportunity.

14:27.743 --> 14:29.859
( chuckles mischievously)

14:29.870 --> 14:33.658
You will submit identification
details before we can process
a background analysis.

14:33.665 --> 14:36.498
I will not submit for a
background appraisal.

14:36.501 --> 14:39.208
You will trust me as
I am or I am gone.

14:46.595 --> 14:50.804
Now... what of your background?

15:01.026 --> 15:03.859
How many other Bioloids
are here?

15:03.862 --> 15:06.979
I am the one Resistance member
to infiltrate this posting.

15:06.990 --> 15:11.199
How much hatred exists
here between the Charrids
and the Kalish?

15:11.203 --> 15:13.364
Even more than the
outer worlds.

15:13.371 --> 15:16.659
There's more at stake.
Bigger egos.

15:16.666 --> 15:19.157
Then I will be straight
with you.

15:20.128 --> 15:22.585
We want to ignite that hatred

15:22.589 --> 15:26.457
and we want to use it as a
cover for our escape.

15:26.468 --> 15:28.959
Will you help us?

15:31.389 --> 15:35.098
1812, get that Scarran vacuum
cleaner outta' here.

15:35.102 --> 15:37.263
(electronic chirping)

15:38.230 --> 15:40.346
That's a good boy.

15:40.357 --> 15:42.393
Do you think she's
figured it out yet?

15:42.400 --> 15:45.767
I don't think so. She still
looks pretty damned stressed.

15:45.779 --> 15:47.269
I'm not surprised.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.316
If she doesn't go home
with a peace treaty,

15:49.324 --> 15:51.781
she's going to be in a lot of
trouble with High Command.

15:51.785 --> 15:53.946
I reckon.

15:53.954 --> 15:55.740
As long as your stress levels
are all right.

15:55.747 --> 16:00.207
Ah, well, considering the
fact that we're now
nuclear terrorists.

16:00.210 --> 16:02.417
( bomb beeping rhythmically)

16:02.420 --> 16:05.412
Bomb seems to think I'm okay.

16:05.423 --> 16:07.379
Provided that thing's working.

16:08.426 --> 16:13.716
(rapid beeping )

16:14.850 --> 16:16.340
It's working.

16:16.351 --> 16:17.636
( chuckles )

16:19.563 --> 16:21.849
Oh, you are dangerous.

16:21.857 --> 16:25.475
Well you better keep
away, then.

16:25.485 --> 16:28.898
Sire. We have a good scan of
Crichton's fission device

16:28.905 --> 16:31.157
but decoding it could
take some time.

16:31.158 --> 16:33.524
Not if you expect to prosper.

16:40.292 --> 16:43.034
You came back.

16:43.044 --> 16:45.535
Couldn't figure a way to
disarm my bomb, huh?

16:47.424 --> 16:48.288
Not yet.

16:51.970 --> 16:54.086
Refreshment.

16:58.435 --> 17:00.676
Crystherium Utilia.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.393
An acquired taste.

17:02.397 --> 17:04.308
Streletzia.

17:04.316 --> 17:05.396
Hummingbird feeder.

17:05.400 --> 17:06.901
You know of our delicacy?

17:06.902 --> 17:10.065
Bird of paradise? Yeah, Mom's
garden. Dime a dozen.

17:10.071 --> 17:13.108
Did you come all this way
to discuss botany?
-Or to make an offer?

17:13.116 --> 17:16.654
Have you got anything to offer?
Or is all this just an
elaborate bluff?

17:16.661 --> 17:20.028
You don't believe that I can
control wormholes?

17:20.040 --> 17:22.747
Would you believe
without proof?

17:24.711 --> 17:27.327
Fine. We'll meet you halfway.

17:27.339 --> 17:31.378
Navigational data chip.
Local star chart.

17:31.384 --> 17:35.969
Send a ship to the designated
coordinates and let us know
when they arrive.

17:35.972 --> 17:37.587
Why?

17:37.599 --> 17:38.839
Proof.

17:38.850 --> 17:40.386
Crichton:
Command performance.

17:40.393 --> 17:43.806
We're gonna put on the
wormhole show, just for you.

17:46.942 --> 17:48.898
Not interested, huh?

17:48.902 --> 17:50.858
I'm sure Grayza will be.

17:51.488 --> 17:53.069
Wait.

18:05.168 --> 18:09.502
Dispatch a Stryker with
full instrumentation to
these coordinates.

18:09.506 --> 18:11.121
Have you checked
Crichton's ship?

18:11.132 --> 18:13.544
No. It's protected by
a force field.

18:13.551 --> 18:15.587
We may be able to override it.

18:15.595 --> 18:18.007
Do so. Check its logs,
its star charts.

18:18.014 --> 18:19.424
Get all the information you can.

18:22.894 --> 18:26.603
This is folly. Crichton plainly
knows nothing about wormholes.

18:26.606 --> 18:27.937
And Scorpius does?

18:27.941 --> 18:29.431
We'll soon find out.

18:29.442 --> 18:32.354
He's ready for his
final inquisitor.

18:32.362 --> 18:33.943
( growls )

18:33.947 --> 18:35.187
( coughs )

18:35.198 --> 18:37.985
Ahkna:
You're very resilient, Scorpius.

18:38.910 --> 18:41.117
It must be my Scarran genes.

18:41.121 --> 18:42.952
( laughs )

18:42.956 --> 18:45.538
We could trade places
and find out.

18:45.542 --> 18:46.827
( laughs )

18:46.835 --> 18:49.747
How would you like
to punish me?

18:49.754 --> 18:52.712
If you want the pleasure
of knowing,

18:52.716 --> 18:55.583
release me for an em.

18:55.593 --> 18:58.585
Oh, I wish we had more time.

18:58.596 --> 19:03.090
But what I need to know now
is what you do know
about wormholes.

19:03.101 --> 19:08.346
You torture me and I will amuse
myself with dreams of you.

19:10.525 --> 19:14.894
Kill me and my knowledge
will die with me.

19:14.904 --> 19:17.190
Are you sure?

19:17.198 --> 19:20.486
Even if an old friend helped
you to the other side?

19:24.873 --> 19:26.864
Stark!

19:26.875 --> 19:29.708
There's no way to escape,
Scorpius.

19:29.711 --> 19:31.576
Not even into death.

19:31.588 --> 19:40.178
Because as you're making
your agonizing passage
to the other side,

19:40.180 --> 19:43.764
I'm going to capture your
soul and with it,

19:43.767 --> 19:45.678
everything you know.

19:46.519 --> 19:47.474
( screaming )

19:50.565 --> 19:53.523
( screaming )

19:53.526 --> 19:55.778
(gasps )

19:55.779 --> 19:59.613
Oh, I've waited many a cycle
for this, Scorpius.

19:59.616 --> 20:04.485
Dreamed so many
sleepless dreams.

20:04.496 --> 20:09.832
Every dashed hope, every plunge
into terrified despair

20:09.834 --> 20:13.042
that I suffered at your hands
in the Aurora Chair.

20:13.046 --> 20:15.037
( screaming )

20:15.048 --> 20:20.293
But rather than the two cycles
that fate gave you to
screw with my soul,

20:20.303 --> 20:24.012
she's only given me two arns
to be finished with you.

20:24.015 --> 20:28.725
So, I guess I better be a
little more imaginative.

20:29.604 --> 20:33.142
( screaming )

20:33.149 --> 20:35.731
I think this may have
possibilities.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.771
( screaming )

20:38.905 --> 20:41.112
Listen to this.
-What?

20:42.534 --> 20:45.276
(whispers ):
Listen. Can you hear that?

20:45.286 --> 20:47.493
(Scorpius moans)

20:47.497 --> 20:49.237
That's Scorpius.

20:49.249 --> 20:51.956
You sure?
-Yes, yes, I'm sure. Completely.

20:53.378 --> 20:54.663
You go tell Crichton.

20:54.671 --> 20:58.255
I'll try and find out where
they're keeping him.
-Okay.

20:58.258 --> 21:00.544
Noranti:
Scorpius can't possibly
hold out much longer.

21:00.552 --> 21:02.508
If he hasn't broken already.

21:02.512 --> 21:03.843
Rygel?

21:03.847 --> 21:07.089
Oh, the Scarrans will never
make you rich.

21:07.100 --> 21:11.560
I can make you rich, if you
come and work for me.
-Rygel?

21:11.563 --> 21:14.270
D'Argo ( hushed ):
Rygel is busy at
the moment, John.

21:14.274 --> 21:17.016
Crichton:
Sikozu?

21:17.026 --> 21:18.812
Everything is going to plan.

21:18.820 --> 21:21.152
The plan is too slow.
Speed things up, please.

21:21.156 --> 21:23.568
Yeah, well, we're going
as fast as we can.

21:23.575 --> 21:27.739
I will try, but I'll need
some time, John.

21:27.745 --> 21:30.657
Why do we never have
enough time?

21:30.665 --> 21:34.157
Why should I go to work for
a frelling Hynerian,

21:34.169 --> 21:37.411
when I'm already a General in
the Scarrans' service?

21:37.422 --> 21:39.583
Ha, that'll end very soon,

21:39.591 --> 21:42.708
when the Scarrans sever all
ties with the Charrids.

21:42.719 --> 21:44.175
You're a lying slug!

21:44.179 --> 21:46.636
They're going to war with
the Peacekeepers.

21:46.639 --> 21:49.176
But not with you as
their allies.

21:49.184 --> 21:50.970
Just with the Kalish.

21:50.977 --> 21:54.219
Hah! The Kalish are just Techs.

21:54.230 --> 21:57.893
Well, the Scarrans are building
a wormhole weapon.

21:57.901 --> 22:00.438
They need Techs, not soldiers.

22:00.445 --> 22:02.731
Rygel:
And the Kalish know it.

22:02.739 --> 22:05.697
That's why they're planning to
sabotage the Charrids

22:05.700 --> 22:09.113
by embarrassing you in front
of the Scarrans.

22:09.120 --> 22:11.782
They would never be so
bold as to do that!

22:11.789 --> 22:16.658
Ha! They are as stupid as
the Kalish say they are.

22:16.669 --> 22:22.539
Join me before the Scarrans
throw you off this rock.

22:22.550 --> 22:24.586
Crichton's fission device.

22:24.594 --> 22:29.463
It's all just spare parts,
mostly salvaged from devices
I've never seen before.

22:29.474 --> 22:32.591
I don't care if it's made out
of your mother's bones.

22:32.602 --> 22:34.809
I need to know how to
disarm it.

22:34.812 --> 22:36.848
We just need a few
solar days...

22:36.856 --> 22:38.596
You don't have them!

22:38.608 --> 22:43.443
Either you'll disarm it now,
or I'll find some species
that will.

22:43.446 --> 22:44.686
( growls )

22:48.785 --> 22:50.821
(whispers ):
What do you think?

22:50.828 --> 22:52.784
It's just like she said.

22:52.789 --> 22:55.326
The Charrids are trying to
incite the Scarrans against us,

22:55.333 --> 22:56.664
and it's starting to work.

23:00.421 --> 23:01.797
Crichton:
And what about Scorpius?

23:01.798 --> 23:03.834
Chiana:
Uh, he's somewhere
on this level.

23:03.841 --> 23:05.672
Aeryn:
All right. Well if we can't
make it to Lo'La,

23:05.677 --> 23:08.214
we're going to be looking for
alternate escape routes.

23:08.221 --> 23:09.506
To the surface?
-Mm.

23:09.514 --> 23:10.720
I'll keep looking.
-Thank you.

23:14.894 --> 23:17.886
You have cost me a Stryker
and its crew.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.512
Really? How did I do that?

23:19.524 --> 23:23.437
At your coordinates, a wormhole
opened and swallowed them up!

23:23.444 --> 23:25.059
What... what did you do?
Oh, no.

23:25.071 --> 23:27.733
Do not tell me you ordered
them into the wormhole.

23:27.740 --> 23:30.698
She told you to call us
when they got there!

23:30.702 --> 23:32.192
You should've warned me!

23:32.203 --> 23:34.034
Don't lay this off on me!

23:34.038 --> 23:36.245
You wanted proof, you got it.

23:36.249 --> 23:38.831
Did you cause that
wormhole to open?

23:38.835 --> 23:40.917
No. No more freebies.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.878
You wanna do a deal, or you
want me to sell it to
the Peacekeepers

23:43.881 --> 23:46.839
so they can gobble up
all of your warships?

23:46.843 --> 23:48.925
Do not threaten me.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.919
( bomb beeping faster)
I'm not threatening?

23:50.930 --> 23:52.761
I'm just a guy with
something to sell.

23:52.765 --> 23:55.723
You don't wanna buy it,
I'm sure someone else will.

23:56.603 --> 23:58.218
( growls )

23:58.229 --> 24:00.936
( beeping slowing down)
I didn't push him
too hard, did I?

24:00.940 --> 24:04.478
He'll make an offer.

24:04.485 --> 24:07.022
An entire cavern just to grow
the flowers they eat?

24:07.030 --> 24:08.986
And it's a high security area.

24:08.990 --> 24:10.446
Why?

24:16.164 --> 24:17.745
We don't know.

24:17.749 --> 24:20.035
But only the Charrids are
supposed to have the
access codes.

24:20.043 --> 24:21.908
So if anyone else
enters the cavern,

24:21.919 --> 24:25.787
the Scarrans will assume the
Charrids left it accessible.

24:25.798 --> 24:28.540
Like... this.

24:31.220 --> 24:33.427
You stole the codes.

24:33.431 --> 24:35.843
Which is what the Charrids
will suspect.

24:35.850 --> 24:38.341
And they will confront us.

24:40.021 --> 24:44.515
Crichton, we've found a much
faster way to incite a riot.

24:44.525 --> 24:46.777
Crichton:
That's great.
Let me hear it... later.

24:48.112 --> 24:50.023
Nice pants.

24:50.031 --> 24:50.816
Hey, Braca.

24:52.784 --> 24:55.776
You look a little lost.

24:55.787 --> 24:57.527
Aeryn:
Does Mommy know you're here?

24:57.538 --> 25:00.075
Does Mommy know he's
Scorpius's boy?

25:01.959 --> 25:03.790
Oh, no. Mommy doesn't know.

25:09.926 --> 25:13.009
Are you here to rescue him,
or kill him?

25:13.012 --> 25:15.173
( Scorpius screaming )

25:18.559 --> 25:21.141
Ahkna:
Stark. Conceal yourself.

25:21.979 --> 25:23.810
( growls )

25:23.815 --> 25:25.851
Crichton:
We're here to see Scorpius.

25:25.858 --> 25:27.189
Come in.

25:30.488 --> 25:32.570
Just you.

25:47.213 --> 25:48.828
(Scorpius gagging )

25:55.221 --> 25:55.880
John...

25:57.515 --> 25:59.051
Grasshopper.

26:00.393 --> 26:02.008
( breath quivers )

26:16.534 --> 26:18.070
That's a nice hat.

26:18.077 --> 26:19.362
(grunts)

26:19.370 --> 26:20.985
Aeryn:
Ahkna don't!

26:20.997 --> 26:22.407
What do you say?

26:22.415 --> 26:24.371
Too happy? Too sad?

26:24.375 --> 26:26.582
Too cold? Too hot?

26:26.586 --> 26:28.417
Let's see, hmm?

26:30.381 --> 26:30.915
(grunts)

26:34.260 --> 26:37.297
Ahkna:
I know you have a
real nuclear device,

26:37.305 --> 26:39.512
but I'm sure you can disarm it.

26:39.515 --> 26:41.927
Ahh, come on.

26:41.934 --> 26:44.926
I would, but I can't,

26:44.937 --> 26:46.802
so I won't.

26:46.814 --> 26:47.929
You're bluffing.

26:47.940 --> 26:51.273
What? So much for
nuclear deterrents.

26:51.277 --> 26:53.984
Get ready to kiss your ass
goodbye, Castro.

26:57.658 --> 27:00.821
( beeping )

27:00.828 --> 27:02.568
( laughs )

27:03.956 --> 27:05.162
(gasps )

27:05.166 --> 27:06.952
You're insane.

27:10.004 --> 27:11.369
Release her.

27:15.176 --> 27:16.666
You all right?

27:16.677 --> 27:17.962
Yeah.
-You're mad.

27:17.970 --> 27:20.347
Just played a game of chicken.
Did I win?

27:20.348 --> 27:22.930
Just. This time.

27:22.934 --> 27:25.346
You take the initiative
next time.

27:27.730 --> 27:28.970
Aeryn:
I'll take it now.

27:32.109 --> 27:32.939
Not yet.

27:37.156 --> 27:38.737
Aeryn.

27:50.086 --> 27:52.953
You found Scorpius being
tortured and you just
left him there?

27:52.964 --> 27:56.673
Crichton:
It's not time, yet.
That's why we're here.

28:00.555 --> 28:02.136
Morning.

28:05.685 --> 28:08.051
As long as this helps
start the conflict.

28:08.062 --> 28:09.268
Yes, it will.

28:09.272 --> 28:11.604
Might even get
yourselves killed.

28:11.607 --> 28:13.859
Then we'll all go together.

28:15.444 --> 28:17.275
Good luck.

28:23.327 --> 28:24.908
Well...

28:29.667 --> 28:31.749
Give me your hand.

28:31.752 --> 28:34.164
Put it on my shoulder.

28:34.171 --> 28:36.207
Come here.

28:36.215 --> 28:38.501
All right, stand on my feet.

28:43.097 --> 28:44.052
Comfortable?

28:44.056 --> 28:46.138
Mm-hmm. You?

28:46.142 --> 28:47.757
Hold tight.

28:51.147 --> 28:53.479
(giggles )

29:08.873 --> 29:14.084
I don't care what you think the
Kalish might or might not do.

29:14.086 --> 29:17.999
The Scarrans would never
dissolve our partnership.

29:18.007 --> 29:19.247
(laughing)

29:19.258 --> 29:20.839
What partnership?

29:20.843 --> 29:22.708
You aren't their partners.

29:22.720 --> 29:26.429
You're nothing more than
ill-paid, ill-treated and...

29:26.432 --> 29:30.892
(sniffing)
...i||-smelling servants.

29:31.520 --> 29:34.102
(roaring)

29:34.106 --> 29:35.767
I don't think so.

29:43.240 --> 29:45.367
Is this our floor?

29:45.368 --> 29:48.986
I don't know. Have to get out
and have a look around.

29:50.289 --> 29:52.371
(alarm sounding)

29:52.375 --> 29:55.367
Intruder alert in the
Crystherium chamber.

29:55.378 --> 29:58.211
Quick! Check it. Now!

29:58.214 --> 29:59.545
Hurry!

30:11.602 --> 30:13.103
Never knew Scarrans were
so sentimental.

30:29.954 --> 30:31.660
No one around.

30:32.331 --> 30:34.617
So.

30:34.625 --> 30:37.492
What do you want to do
to get noticed?

30:40.256 --> 30:42.497
I got arrested once.

30:43.217 --> 30:44.548
College.

30:44.552 --> 30:46.417
Let me show ya.

30:49.223 --> 30:51.930
What are you doing here?
Come out. Now!

30:51.934 --> 30:53.470
Crichton:
Damn.

30:53.978 --> 30:55.934
Up. Now!

30:59.358 --> 31:00.188
It's never enough time.

31:02.278 --> 31:04.018
(zipping)

31:09.702 --> 31:12.364
Who gave you the codes?
-What codes?

31:12.371 --> 31:14.987
Crichton: ( Mexican accent)
Codes? We didn't need
no stinkin' codes.

31:14.999 --> 31:17.866
Ahkna:
You could not have accessed
the cavern without codes.

31:17.877 --> 31:20.334
We didn't try to
access anything.

31:20.337 --> 31:23.625
Some Charrids got off the
elevator. We got on,
we got off...

31:23.632 --> 31:26.044
Well, we tried to get off.
We got interrupted.

31:26.052 --> 31:27.883
Which Charrids?

31:27.887 --> 31:30.219
Are you serious?
They all look alike.

31:30.222 --> 31:32.087
You should put numbers on
their uniforms.

31:32.099 --> 31:34.590
The Charrid troops are
your responsibility.

31:34.602 --> 31:36.934
I'll order a full inquiry.

31:42.777 --> 31:45.610
You know, while you're at it,
give me Scorpius.

31:45.613 --> 31:48.229
You want Scorpius? Why?

31:48.240 --> 31:51.152
Is it because he's going to
give us what you're trying
to sell us?

31:51.160 --> 31:55.369
No. Because the hat lady
is pissing me off and
I wanna piss her off.

31:55.372 --> 31:57.363
Tit for tat. Call it a whim.

31:57.374 --> 32:01.617
And I don't like watching
people be tortured who
don't know anything.

32:01.629 --> 32:05.417
What do you know about
wormholes, Scorpius?

32:05.424 --> 32:06.504
Tell me!

32:06.509 --> 32:08.374
I know nothing!

32:08.385 --> 32:09.761
You're lying.

32:09.762 --> 32:11.548
You tell me.

32:12.473 --> 32:15.215
I said, I know nothing.
Know nothing.

32:23.734 --> 32:27.477
It's a normal part of
the procedure.

32:27.488 --> 32:31.072
He, um, he's strong.
He's very strong.

32:31.075 --> 32:34.863
That means, when he finally
breaks, it'll be all the
more catastrophic.

32:34.870 --> 32:38.954
You promised me...
-That I would break him,
not that he knows anything.

32:38.958 --> 32:40.664
But if he does,
you will know...

32:40.668 --> 32:44.001
What is happening in here?
-You wanted the information
taken from him.

32:44.004 --> 32:45.255
Alive.

32:45.256 --> 32:47.417
I said alive.

32:47.424 --> 32:49.915
And have you learned anything?
-No, not yet, but I...

32:49.927 --> 32:53.340
Crichton has destroyed a Stryker
and found a way into
the caverns.

32:53.347 --> 32:55.804
But you have achieved nothing.

32:56.475 --> 32:57.976
Get out.

32:57.977 --> 32:59.808
This is my jurisdiction.

32:59.812 --> 33:01.848
Not unless I say it is.

33:01.856 --> 33:03.471
Now get out.

33:03.482 --> 33:05.313
All of you.

33:09.280 --> 33:12.613
( gaspsing )

33:13.367 --> 33:15.824
I'll get the truth from him.

33:21.917 --> 33:24.499
I thought you said she
couldn't harm you.

33:24.503 --> 33:27.415
And she couldn't. I'm fine.

33:27.423 --> 33:29.459
Quite fine.

33:29.466 --> 33:32.708
I've caused enough harm in
my time to mimic it well.

33:32.720 --> 33:36.429
We still haven't found a way of
disarming Crichton's weapon.

33:36.432 --> 33:40.095
But he has demonstrated a
convincing command of wormholes.

33:40.102 --> 33:42.514
I can separate him
from the bomb.

33:42.521 --> 33:44.637
He trusts me.

33:44.648 --> 33:46.639
More than he realizes.

33:46.650 --> 33:48.766
Just bring him to me.

33:48.777 --> 33:52.395
Will you? Or will you
betray me?

33:52.406 --> 33:56.490
I've served you for
ten cycles as a spy.

33:56.493 --> 33:58.404
Why would I betray you now?

33:58.412 --> 34:01.404
Betray me and you will die
in this machine.

34:01.415 --> 34:05.374
But deliver Crichton's
knowledge to me,

34:05.377 --> 34:08.335
and all the power you seek
will be yours.

34:30.319 --> 34:32.025
Thank you for returning.

34:32.029 --> 34:34.315
What is it?

34:34.323 --> 34:37.281
I would like to make an
addition to my offer.

34:41.497 --> 34:43.237
I'll have the Kung Pao chicken.

34:43.249 --> 34:44.739
You want a spring roll?

34:44.750 --> 34:48.368
Actually, they're a pardon from
the Supreme Council.

34:48.379 --> 34:51.371
No Peacekeeper would
dare violate them.

34:51.382 --> 34:53.498
She for real?

34:53.509 --> 34:55.465
It would seem so.

34:55.469 --> 34:57.460
However, it is conditional.

34:57.471 --> 34:59.257
Of course.

34:59.265 --> 35:04.100
On no wormhole technology being
shared with the Scarrans.

35:04.937 --> 35:06.643
What if we give these back?

35:06.647 --> 35:08.558
Still valid.

35:08.565 --> 35:10.476
She wouldn't dare destroy them.

35:12.444 --> 35:16.357
I've witnessed them. So have
all our principal officers.

35:16.365 --> 35:18.196
Keep it.

35:18.200 --> 35:19.610
We'll let you know.

35:19.618 --> 35:20.448
(grunting)

35:26.458 --> 35:27.959
Guys, listen up.

35:27.960 --> 35:29.291
They're bringing him now.

35:29.295 --> 35:33.208
One riot, well done,
hold the mayo. Now.

35:33.215 --> 35:36.423
Your troops compromised the
security of the cavern.

35:36.427 --> 35:40.545
No! That is not what happened.

35:40.556 --> 35:42.592
We're very close to
a conflict now.

35:42.599 --> 35:45.727
This ain't horseshoes or hand
grenades. "Now" means now!

35:50.983 --> 35:53.224
A bargain is struck.

35:54.653 --> 35:56.564
(grunts)

35:56.572 --> 36:00.941
However, an agreement requires
trust, which thus far has
been one sided.

36:00.951 --> 36:04.443
Now you tell me what else
you really want.

36:06.874 --> 36:12.460
When you wake up in the morning
on your big emperor bed,

36:12.463 --> 36:17.799
and you listen,
what do you hear?

36:17.801 --> 36:23.467
Do you hear the little emperor
birdies singing outside
your window?

36:23.474 --> 36:27.467
Do you hear the emperor wind
whistling through the trees?

36:29.396 --> 36:32.559
Or do you hear people dying?

36:32.566 --> 36:36.855
Do you hear your friends
begging for mercy?

36:36.862 --> 36:41.652
Do you hear doors being
kicked in because people
are hunting you?

36:41.658 --> 36:45.526
Do you hear the sound of your
heart pounding in your ears?

36:47.498 --> 36:49.864
What I want,

36:49.875 --> 36:52.082
Santa Claus,

36:52.086 --> 36:54.668
For the rest of my life,

36:54.671 --> 36:57.913
I wanna wake up
like an emperor.

36:57.925 --> 37:00.382
Your safety guaranteed.

37:00.386 --> 37:02.468
In just a few arns.

37:02.471 --> 37:05.963
Bill Gates can't guarantee
Windows. How you guarantee
my safety?

37:05.974 --> 37:10.718
With great effort,
and great sincerity.

37:10.729 --> 37:15.063
Though at some point,
my Iargesse will dissipate.

37:22.658 --> 37:24.649
My appreciation.

37:24.660 --> 37:27.402
My ass.

37:29.039 --> 37:30.745
Did you tell them?

37:30.749 --> 37:32.535
(wheezing):
No.

37:32.543 --> 37:34.033
Wormholes!

37:34.044 --> 37:36.751
My brain. Harvey.

37:36.755 --> 37:39.337
What did you tell them?!

37:39.341 --> 37:41.206
Nothing!

37:41.218 --> 37:42.583
Listen up.

37:42.594 --> 37:46.678
I am Johnny Radiation
because of you, Nosferatu.

37:46.682 --> 37:51.267
Everyone I care about west of
the Moon is here and in danger

37:51.270 --> 37:53.932
to make sure that you keep
your mouth shut.

37:53.939 --> 37:55.520
Now!

37:55.524 --> 37:59.267
Did you keep your mouth shut?

37:59.278 --> 38:00.643
Yes!

38:00.654 --> 38:02.190
(gasping)

38:02.197 --> 38:03.573
John...

38:03.574 --> 38:04.563
You believe him?

38:07.411 --> 38:08.947
Yes, I do.

38:08.954 --> 38:10.660
(gagging )

38:10.664 --> 38:12.404
Good.

38:12.416 --> 38:15.078
Kill him and let's go.
-What?

38:15.085 --> 38:18.577
Kill him and let's go.
-We came here to free him.

38:18.589 --> 38:22.298
No, we came here to make sure
that my knowledge didn't
slip out of his mouth.

38:22.301 --> 38:23.837
Kill him, Aeryn, and let's go.

38:23.844 --> 38:26.802
Oh, you want me to kill him?
-Well, I'm not the assassin,
am I?

38:26.805 --> 38:29.091
If you want him to die,
you can kill him yourself.

38:29.099 --> 38:31.681
You made me promise
that I wouldn't.
-Well I release you from that promise.

38:31.685 --> 38:34.677
Say that again.
-I release you from
that promise.

38:34.688 --> 38:36.644
(shuddenng)

38:38.317 --> 38:39.978
Thank you.

38:53.790 --> 38:56.281
I'll give you my bike
if you kill him.

38:56.293 --> 38:58.534
May I speak?

39:00.339 --> 39:03.206
He's telling the truth.
We'll sort you out later.

39:03.217 --> 39:08.086
Guys, I apologize in advance
for any incivility or
insensitivity on my part,

39:08.096 --> 39:09.961
but it is beer o'clock.

39:09.973 --> 39:11.838
where the hell is my riot?

39:11.850 --> 39:16.139
The logs show your Lieutenant
had just returned from
the cavern.

39:16.146 --> 39:18.728
Whose logs? His?

39:18.732 --> 39:20.723
Kalish documentation.

39:20.734 --> 39:22.645
What are you implying, Rahzaro?

39:22.653 --> 39:25.315
( laughs ):
Oh! You're going to get it.

39:25.322 --> 39:30.066
That our intruder could not
decipher the access codes to
the cavern by himself.

39:30.077 --> 39:32.614
Someone had to have
given them to him.

39:32.621 --> 39:35.158
I protest this
baseless accusation.

39:35.165 --> 39:38.953
Then find out where the
fault does lie.

39:38.961 --> 39:44.581
I expect a full account from
each side in less than two arns.

39:44.591 --> 39:45.671
( growls )

39:46.885 --> 39:49.376
Ha!

39:49.388 --> 39:52.380
Tear down the system
to the foundation.

39:52.391 --> 39:53.847
Find the leak!

39:53.850 --> 39:54.839
(grunts)

39:54.851 --> 39:57.684
I will not be humiliated
by you, Vakali.

39:57.688 --> 39:59.929
You will not destroy my
relationship with the Emperor.

39:59.940 --> 40:02.898
What the frell are you
blathering about, Charrid?

40:02.901 --> 40:07.736
Your security forces prove
useless and you seek to
refocus the blame!

40:07.739 --> 40:11.948
Useless? My forces, useless?!

40:11.952 --> 40:16.571
Ordering biscuits and repairing
urinals has never won a war.

40:16.582 --> 40:18.618
And neither have you,
if I recall.

40:19.876 --> 40:23.915
Insult a Charrid at
your own risk,

40:23.922 --> 40:25.708
Kalish hapooda.

40:25.716 --> 40:27.581
"Hapooda"?

40:27.593 --> 40:30.926
You dare to call me "hapooda"?

40:30.929 --> 40:34.763
And I bet... not a
very good one.

40:34.766 --> 40:36.302
(grunting)

40:38.770 --> 40:40.351
(yells)

40:46.778 --> 40:48.359
( groans )

40:55.579 --> 40:55.783
(yells)

41:01.752 --> 41:03.834
(yells)

41:03.837 --> 41:05.748
Pennoch:
What is this?

41:05.756 --> 41:06.962
( growls )

41:06.965 --> 41:08.341
Stop it.

41:08.342 --> 41:10.583
Stop it at once.

41:10.594 --> 41:13.051
Strike Warriors to the
Control Center.

41:13.055 --> 41:15.592
Confiscate all weapons!

41:15.599 --> 41:18.341
Now, Crichton. Leave now.

41:18.352 --> 41:21.185
And never doubt your
Dominar again.

41:26.485 --> 41:27.645
(yells)

41:30.447 --> 41:31.983
(yells)

41:35.827 --> 41:37.863
I must go.

41:37.871 --> 41:39.827
Sha-kana-sho.
-Sha-kana-sho.

41:39.831 --> 41:43.119
(gasps )
Go!

41:43.126 --> 41:45.993
We've been sabotaged.
The Charrids and Kalish
are fighting.

41:46.004 --> 41:48.996
Guards. Secure Crichton
and report.

41:49.007 --> 41:51.089
Scorpius.
We must secure Scorpius.

41:51.093 --> 41:53.049
Don't worry about Scorpius.

41:53.053 --> 41:54.918
He's not going anywhere.

41:54.930 --> 41:57.592
( groans )

41:57.599 --> 42:00.011
Everyone, go.
We're on the move.

42:00.894 --> 42:03.101
Some help would be appreciated.

42:03.105 --> 42:06.142
Where do you expect us to run?

42:06.149 --> 42:08.356
Got a taxi waiting. First rule
of piss poor planning:

42:08.360 --> 42:10.476
have your exit ready
before your entrance.

42:10.487 --> 42:11.977
What? This disturbance?

42:11.988 --> 42:14.775
Yeah, pretty cool, huh?
-Yes, I'm impressed.

42:14.783 --> 42:16.899
There's just no pleasing
some people.

42:16.910 --> 42:18.901
Remain where you are,
or I'll shoot.

42:18.912 --> 42:21.324
Release your weapons now.

42:21.331 --> 42:22.707
(yells)

42:25.168 --> 42:26.203
Braca?

42:26.211 --> 42:27.872
Yeah, feel the love, Mr. Burns.

42:29.464 --> 42:31.045
Frell.

42:31.049 --> 42:34.007
Hey, can you help us?
We're... we're afraid.

42:34.010 --> 42:37.377
You have to turn back.
Can't pass here.

42:37.389 --> 42:38.595
( exhales )

42:38.598 --> 42:40.134
( groans )

42:44.146 --> 42:46.683
(thud )
It works!

42:49.276 --> 42:51.892
We're getting close.
Don't leave without us.

42:51.903 --> 42:54.519
Warrior. Can you take this
Kalish piece of tralk?

42:54.531 --> 42:55.737
What do you want me...

42:58.869 --> 43:00.734
Hurry up!
-We try it a third time?

43:00.746 --> 43:01.861
Warrior.
-What?

43:01.872 --> 43:04.284
Could you take this Kalish
piece of tralk?

43:05.834 --> 43:07.290
We're almost home. There it is.

43:07.294 --> 43:11.378
Scorpius:
D'Argo's vessel, even shrouded
cannot outrun a Stryker!

43:11.381 --> 43:14.088
Moya's disguised as an
ore freighter in the
shipping yards.

43:14.092 --> 43:15.832
She's rested and ready
to Starburst.

43:15.844 --> 43:17.004
Oh, crap.

43:17.012 --> 43:18.092
Aeryn.

43:18.096 --> 43:20.212
We can broker a bargain.

43:20.223 --> 43:22.259
Where's your nerve, Grasshopper?

43:22.267 --> 43:24.883
Just stick with me,
they ain't gonna pop Fat Man.

43:26.021 --> 43:27.477
I can't!

43:27.481 --> 43:28.937
(gurgling)

43:33.487 --> 43:35.227
You better not pass out.

43:38.450 --> 43:39.940
Get up, or I kill you now.

43:46.500 --> 43:47.956
Choose.

43:47.959 --> 43:50.245
You need to know when
a woman's serious.

43:52.964 --> 43:54.500
Are you coming?

43:59.513 --> 44:01.799
(gagging )

44:01.807 --> 44:03.422
(gasps )

44:04.059 --> 44:06.015
Okay.

44:06.019 --> 44:07.600
Drop your weapons.

44:07.604 --> 44:10.562
Don't fire or you'll
detonate the bomb.

44:11.441 --> 44:13.022
(grunting)

44:13.026 --> 44:15.642
Well there you go.
Someone finally got smart.

44:17.239 --> 44:18.900
(gagS)

44:25.497 --> 44:27.112
(grunts)

44:28.542 --> 44:30.908
You stupid son of a bitch!

44:30.919 --> 44:32.034
I'm sorry, John,

44:32.045 --> 44:35.037
but you need to breathe deeply
if you expect to live.

44:35.048 --> 44:37.505
You're gonna get us all killed!

44:37.509 --> 44:40.171
( bomb beeping )
Now, if you trust me
enough to live,

44:40.178 --> 44:42.260
you may well discover
the truth.

44:42.264 --> 44:43.925
Trust you?

44:44.808 --> 44:46.264
Trust you?

44:46.268 --> 44:49.476
( screaming )

44:49.479 --> 44:52.812
(bomb alarm beeping)
