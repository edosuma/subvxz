00:04.003 --> 00:07.213
â€œWerewolves that are turned,
up to four generations from pureblood...

00:07.407 --> 00:12.220
...are less feral and can transform
before, during, and after the lunar cycle."

00:12.412 --> 00:16.918
Human by day, a freak animal killing-machine
by moonlight, werewolves are badass.

00:17.150 --> 00:20.825
Best part about it is we already know
how to bring these suckers down.

00:21.054 --> 00:24.524
- One of these bad boys right to the heart.
- Dean's a demon.

00:24.725 --> 00:28.605
I don't know how you did this, what
black-magic stunt you pulled, but hear me:

00:28.829 --> 00:31.708
I will save my brother or die trying.

00:31.899 --> 00:33.708
- Stop. It's over, Dean.
- Argh!

00:33.901 --> 00:36.677
There's a difference from what
I turned into to what you are.

00:36.870 --> 00:37.905
What's that mean?

00:38.105 --> 00:40.051
I know what you did
when you went looking for me.

00:40.240 --> 00:42.777
Which one of us
is really the monster, hmm?

00:43.544 --> 00:45.717
You might actually be worse than me.

00:46.947 --> 00:50.690
Got a whole bunch more of these to go.
You can make it a lot easier on yourself.

00:50.884 --> 00:53.057
What the hell are we doing to him, Cass?

00:53.253 --> 00:56.393
The ritual of purified blood
is the only treatment I know.

00:59.192 --> 01:02.401
- You look worried, fellas.
- Welcome back, Dean.

01:02.596 --> 01:05.372
Maybe you should, um, take some time
before you get back to work.

01:05.566 --> 01:06.806
Allow yourself to heal.

02:21.174 --> 02:24.314
Damn. A girl after my own heart.

02:24.511 --> 02:27.048
That's the idea, sweetie.

02:28.782 --> 02:29.852
What the hell?

03:04.751 --> 03:06.890
Hey, something I needed to ask you.

03:09.423 --> 03:12.097
- Shoot.
- You've been...

03:12.392 --> 03:17.535
... kicked, bit, scratched,
stabbed, possessed, killed...

03:19.032 --> 03:21.103
...and you sprained your freaking elbow?

03:22.502 --> 03:26.575
Dude, it was more than a sprain, all right?
And it was a freaking demon, but...

03:26.773 --> 03:27.945
But what?

03:28.709 --> 03:31.918
That sling come with a slice
of crybaby pie, on the side?

03:33.447 --> 03:35.290
Please...

03:45.859 --> 03:47.634
How you doing?

03:50.464 --> 03:52.876
- I'm golden, man.
- Come on.

03:54.401 --> 03:55.778
Seriously, I'm good.

03:55.969 --> 04:01.317
I am. You know, we got three more
cases of this stuff on ice in the trunk.

04:01.541 --> 04:05.785
Taking some "we" time,
best decision we ever made.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.116
Hear that.

04:19.559 --> 04:21.834
See that thing in the paper this morning?

04:24.264 --> 04:25.607
Maybe it was an animal kill.

04:25.799 --> 04:30.407
It was three kills, and it was in
the same town, all within the last month.

04:30.604 --> 04:33.744
Yeah. You're right. We should call
some guys, have them fix it.

04:33.940 --> 04:36.420
- Good. Smart.
- Done.

04:39.479 --> 04:41.186
Or...

04:42.449 --> 04:45.828
- We could be in and out. It's a milk run.
- Right.

04:46.019 --> 04:49.000
Because that happens never.

04:49.189 --> 04:53.001
Look, Sam.
What we're doing here? It's good. Okay?

04:53.493 --> 04:54.699
You and me hanging out.

04:57.597 --> 04:59.167
But I need to work.

05:00.867 --> 05:02.710
I need this.

05:07.674 --> 05:13.386
If things go sideways, I mean like,
an inch, you gotta give me the heads up.

05:13.680 --> 05:16.183
Done. You got my word.

05:32.199 --> 05:33.735
Gentlemen.

05:35.902 --> 05:39.213
Well, I'm not gonna lie.
We're damn glad to see you.

05:39.406 --> 05:41.909
You boys must come up
on stuff like this all the time.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.711
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah. Definitely.

05:43.910 --> 05:48.154
Hell, seen raccoons in rec rooms,
bears in swimming pools, but this?

05:48.348 --> 05:50.885
- You tell me.
- Yeah.

05:54.888 --> 05:59.769
Oh, well, where do we start?
What with the logging...

06:00.060 --> 06:02.563
- The ice caps.
- Bitcoin, yeah.

06:04.564 --> 06:06.271
Obama.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.937
You know, maybe you could
walk us through the attacks.

06:10.437 --> 06:12.212
Any similarities, anything weird.

06:12.405 --> 06:14.908
Only thing weird about them
was how similar they were.

06:15.108 --> 06:18.954
Folks torn clean through, hearts absent.

06:19.179 --> 06:21.557
- Hearts absent as in...?
- Consumed, most likely.

06:23.617 --> 06:24.960
And there were no witnesses?

06:25.218 --> 06:27.459
Town-square attack,
parking lot, those were late.

06:27.787 --> 06:32.532
But with how jammed the bar was, you'd
think somebody other than Tommy would see.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.766
- And what did he see?
- Honestly, not much.

06:34.961 --> 06:37.805
Now, Tommy ain't exactly
what we'd call a reliable witness.

06:38.064 --> 06:43.275
He's telling anybody who'll listen he saw a
girl go with Barker, and she got torn up too.

06:43.470 --> 06:45.609
- So there was a second victim?
- Well, sure.

06:45.805 --> 06:46.977
Except Tommy's a drunk.

06:47.240 --> 06:51.814
There's no body, no DNA,
no blood trail, no nothing to suggest that.

06:52.612 --> 06:54.614
- Give me one sec.
- Yeah.

06:55.815 --> 06:59.490
- Hearts missing. Sounds wolfy, right?
- Yeah. Pretty brazen, even for a werewolf.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.494
You think it was the girl?

07:02.455 --> 07:03.593
Let's find out.

07:05.325 --> 07:09.967
Yeah. Barker and I been raising hell,
chasing tail and riding for a long time.

07:10.163 --> 07:14.134
Part of him always knew when his
clock ran out it wasn't gonna be pretty.

07:14.334 --> 07:15.779
To go out like that?

07:15.969 --> 07:17.607
By some animal?

07:17.804 --> 07:21.115
- Just ain't right.
- You mind, uh, telling us what went down?

07:21.408 --> 07:23.115
It was just another party, you know?

07:23.310 --> 07:27.349
Barker went out back, then everyone's
yelling and screaming. He's all torn up.

07:27.580 --> 07:30.652
Sheriff mentioned you thought
there might've been a girl involved.

07:30.850 --> 07:33.524
- You think she was killed too?
- No.

07:34.988 --> 07:37.025
So there was no girl?

07:37.691 --> 07:39.466
Couldn't say.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.702
You know we're not cops, right?

07:44.531 --> 07:45.839
Badge is a badge.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.976
You should also know
that working outdoors the way we do...

07:49.169 --> 07:51.171
...we see some pretty weird crap.

07:51.538 --> 07:53.518
Stuff that we can't explain.

07:53.707 --> 07:57.849
Hell, half the stuff we wouldn't believe
it ourselves had we not seen it together.

07:58.044 --> 08:00.888
You don't live here, mister.
Don't have to deal with ridicule.

08:01.147 --> 08:05.220
I'm just saying that crazy might
not be as half as crazy as you think.

08:06.686 --> 08:10.532
So if someone were to tell you
they saw a ghost, you'd believe that?

08:13.793 --> 08:16.171
Just assume we believe everything.

08:17.397 --> 08:19.070
Okay, then.

08:19.399 --> 08:21.879
Other night I was riding past
the old Sturges farm...

08:22.068 --> 08:25.515
...you know, thinking about the rides
me and Barker used to go on.

08:25.872 --> 08:27.180
I saw her, man.

08:27.374 --> 08:29.012
Saw "her" who?

08:29.209 --> 08:31.189
- The girl.
- What? After the attack?

08:31.378 --> 08:34.222
Yeah. She was just standing
there, all bloody. Watching me.

08:34.414 --> 08:37.224
So I turn the hell around.
I ran back thinking:

08:37.417 --> 08:40.830
"Damn, she's hurt or something,"
but she was just gone.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.331
Like, gone.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.862
Like a ghost.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.900
I don't give one red cent in hell
what the cops say.

08:50.096 --> 08:52.599
She was there. She was eaten.

08:52.866 --> 08:55.073
She's a freaking ghost.

09:11.618 --> 09:14.565
Ghosts don't shred people like that.

09:15.388 --> 09:21.304
Yeah, well, this fleabag looks like she ain't
done chowing down Sons of Anarchy just yet.

09:22.228 --> 09:23.866
Guess she likes bad boys.

09:24.130 --> 09:27.475
Well, wait until she gets a load of us.

10:12.345 --> 10:14.154
Stop ignoring my calls.

10:14.347 --> 10:18.193
Pick up the phone and call me right now.
This isn't how it's supposed to go.

10:18.418 --> 10:22.093
Look. I've been down
this road before and I'm not going to...

10:34.934 --> 10:36.208
What?

10:42.709 --> 10:43.813
Kate?

10:58.691 --> 11:00.170
I know who you are.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.498
Congratulations.

11:01.694 --> 11:04.334
After what happened at school,
I thought you'd let me go.

11:04.531 --> 11:07.307
- That was before you started dropping bodies.
- What?

11:07.500 --> 11:11.141
Guy at the bar saw you before
you went all Wolverine on his buddy.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.715
So surprise. Here we are.

11:14.007 --> 11:17.477
Kate, you said you were gonna go straight.

11:17.677 --> 11:18.712
What happened?

11:20.413 --> 11:22.051
I guess things change.

11:22.482 --> 11:23.517
Being this...

11:24.584 --> 11:27.656
...I tried to be strong,
but the hunger was too much.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.492
Too hard.

11:29.689 --> 11:32.226
Not like anyone gave me
a handbook on being a werewolf.

11:32.425 --> 11:34.735
Looks like you're doing
a pretty good job so far.

11:34.928 --> 11:38.375
- Break some hearts, then you eat them.
- I was on my own.

11:38.565 --> 11:40.772
I evolved.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.606
So that's what you call
killing innocent people?

11:44.737 --> 11:46.273
Whatever you're gonna do...

11:46.506 --> 11:48.543
...just do it.

12:00.420 --> 12:01.455
Hey.

12:11.564 --> 12:14.568
You know what. Let me do it.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.706
Why?

12:17.136 --> 12:20.413
Because I think you
should sit this one out.

12:21.207 --> 12:23.448
- What are you talking about?
- You're not ready, Dean.

12:28.648 --> 12:29.752
Hello?

12:29.949 --> 12:34.898
Warden, we had another animal attack
over at the high school gymnasium.

12:35.088 --> 12:38.001
Guy was a security guard.
Same MO as the other three.

12:38.224 --> 12:40.795
- When?
- Deputy said the victim's blood was still warm...

12:40.994 --> 12:43.634
...when he got there.
So had to be less than an hour ago.

12:43.830 --> 12:46.902
Of course. Thank you.
Um, I'll be in touch.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.944
- We got a problem.
- What, besides Werewolf Barbie over here?

12:50.837 --> 12:55.115
Yeah. There was another kill.
Across town, just before dark.

12:55.308 --> 12:58.846
Well, how did Kate get her murder on,
and then get back here before-J

12:59.078 --> 13:01.684
- You don't think she did it.
- Look. I don't know, man.

13:01.914 --> 13:03.587
But as far as I'm concerned...

13:06.452 --> 13:07.487
Damn it.

13:08.421 --> 13:11.197
All right. If she's not icing people,
why play big bad wolf?

13:11.424 --> 13:14.132
Maybe she's running with a pack.
Trying to protect them?

13:14.327 --> 13:16.534
Wow, hell of a price to pay.

13:16.763 --> 13:20.006
She was about two seconds away
from taking a dirt nap.

13:20.199 --> 13:22.042
- What is that?
- It's her phone.

13:22.268 --> 13:24.475
Let's see who she was booty
calling when we pulled up.

13:27.607 --> 13:30.349
Thank you for calling
the Lincoln Morel. Can I help you?

13:48.294 --> 13:51.366
So, what's this about me
not being ready back there?

13:52.231 --> 13:55.735
I wasn't trying to start something, Dean.
I was just saying...

13:55.968 --> 13:59.006
...I thought that was the
point of us taking a break. You know?

13:59.205 --> 14:00.843
Oh, no. No. Yeah. I get that.

14:01.040 --> 14:04.214
- And you know, there's no worries there.
- Okay.

14:04.711 --> 14:06.213
But I gotta ask. What about you?

14:08.414 --> 14:09.757
"What about me," what?

14:09.982 --> 14:11.017
Are you ready?

14:12.752 --> 14:15.028
Why wouldn't I be ready?

14:15.221 --> 14:16.359
Lester.

14:17.323 --> 14:20.065
- Lester?
- 42:13: wife kicked me to the curb.

14:20.259 --> 14:24.435
We haven't had sex for four months,
but not that she hasn't been having plenty.

14:24.664 --> 14:27.736
It is possible
that you can have your revenge.

14:27.934 --> 14:30.414
Who summons me? For what purpose?

14:30.603 --> 14:32.549
Lester, don't.

14:32.739 --> 14:34.685
Kill my wife, and my soul is yours.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.114
Who are you?

14:37.710 --> 14:38.745
Ow!

14:38.945 --> 14:42.620
You're a punk-ass demon.
You work for me now.

14:46.786 --> 14:49.733
- You're serious? This is about Lester?
- Yeah.

14:51.224 --> 14:54.296
Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying
to start anything neither, okay?

14:54.527 --> 14:58.134
I'm just saying, maybe...
Maybe we ought to talk about that.

14:59.866 --> 15:02.870
Okay. Except there's nothing to talk about.

15:04.637 --> 15:05.980
Okay.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.576
Okay.

15:15.114 --> 15:17.958
I figured since we're opening veins
maybe you'd wanna talk...

15:18.151 --> 15:21.496
...about the guy who you made sell
his soul. - The guy you killed?

15:21.721 --> 15:23.598
- That's the same guy?
- I was a demon.

15:23.790 --> 15:26.669
Oh, you were a demon.
Oh, I didn't realize that.

15:27.927 --> 15:31.340
Hey, man. Lester was gonna pay
for that soul shake sooner or later.

15:31.564 --> 15:34.738
- So technically, it's still on you.
- What do you want from me, Dean?

15:34.934 --> 15:36.436
Look, I...

15:36.836 --> 15:39.339
I'm not happy about it. Okay?
But I needed to find you.

15:39.572 --> 15:42.246
So if I had to bend a few rules...

15:42.442 --> 15:44.922
- Go "dark"?
- "Go dark." Sure.

15:45.111 --> 15:46.590
Label it if you want.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.622
Look. Again, I'm not complaining. Okay?

15:48.815 --> 15:51.455
In fact, I'm doing
just the opposite of complaining. I...

15:51.751 --> 15:53.253
I just...

15:53.686 --> 15:57.498
- You know, between Lester and the others...
- There weren't others.

15:57.690 --> 15:59.761
Okay. Either way.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.170
Maybe we both needed that time off.

16:08.534 --> 16:10.138
This is good.

16:10.336 --> 16:11.815
This is good.

16:12.438 --> 16:14.179
Yeah. Real good.

16:24.717 --> 16:30.531
All right. So the, uh, clerk says a blond
rolled into Room 3 just before sun-up.

16:30.723 --> 16:32.669
- She alone?
- He thinks so.

16:37.797 --> 16:39.401
She's on the move.

16:57.817 --> 16:59.524
What's she doing?

17:00.386 --> 17:02.195
Looking for breakfast.

17:12.765 --> 17:14.438
Kate.

17:15.501 --> 17:16.844
It's over.

17:19.005 --> 17:20.848
Oh, God. Please.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.916
Don't. I'll give you anything you want.

17:24.443 --> 17:26.184
- Where's Kate?
- Who?

17:26.378 --> 17:28.551
You were just in her motel room.

17:28.948 --> 17:30.427
What? That's my room.

17:30.883 --> 17:34.296
- Why were you following that guy?
- Robbie? I know him.

17:34.520 --> 17:36.124
I just wanted to surprise him.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.259
Test her.

17:39.859 --> 17:41.236
Test me for what?

17:42.795 --> 17:45.275
No. Help. Somebody help me.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.442
Just take it easy.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.103
I don't wanna die.

17:58.878 --> 18:01.449
Stop it. Stop it.

18:04.150 --> 18:05.754
Don't.

18:05.985 --> 18:08.090
She's my sister.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.110
I lost her.

18:26.639 --> 18:29.848
Kate, why is your sister a werewolf, huh?

18:30.076 --> 18:31.453
- Let her talk.
- Why? I am.

18:31.644 --> 18:34.250
- Then put the gun down.
- Why? So she can run again? Uh-uh.

18:34.647 --> 18:36.524
She just saved our lives.

18:42.521 --> 18:45.024
My sister's a werewolf
because I turned her into one.

18:46.859 --> 18:49.339
Okay. This is the part
where you help yourself out.

18:49.528 --> 18:52.372
I don't care. All right?
I'm sick of the lies.

18:52.999 --> 18:54.376
Let me get this straight.

18:55.034 --> 18:57.310
We let you run because we take pity on you.

18:57.503 --> 18:59.813
And you turned around
and you started making pups?

19:00.006 --> 19:02.316
- You start killing people.
- It's not like that.

19:02.508 --> 19:03.543
I'm no killer.

19:04.710 --> 19:07.213
The way I remember
from the snuff film you left us...

19:07.446 --> 19:09.858
...is that you killed
your boyfriend's best friend.

19:10.049 --> 19:11.687
That's because Brian went crazy.

19:11.884 --> 19:14.160
- I had no other choice.
- Okay, Kate.

19:14.820 --> 19:17.733
- If this wasn't you...
- That's a big "if."

19:18.224 --> 19:19.396
...then who was it'?

19:20.326 --> 19:21.964
Your sister?

19:23.562 --> 19:25.564
Your sister do this, Kate?

19:27.066 --> 19:28.409
Really?

19:29.368 --> 19:31.905
You almost just took a bullet for her?
You got nothing.

19:33.139 --> 19:34.379
What do you want me to say?

19:34.573 --> 19:36.712
- The truth?
- Hey, guys? Whoa, whoa.

19:36.909 --> 19:39.981
Can we, uh, take it somewhere else?

19:40.246 --> 19:43.853
Oh, yeah. Sure. Let's go grab
some coffee. Maybe some bear hearts.

19:57.229 --> 19:59.231
Just so you know...

19:59.432 --> 20:01.070
...Brian's the reason I carry this.

20:01.267 --> 20:04.441
- Hey.
- I'm just showing you something.

20:05.604 --> 20:07.379
In case I ever lose it...

20:07.573 --> 20:09.575
...like Brian did...

20:10.209 --> 20:11.620
...you won't have to kill me.

20:12.111 --> 20:14.284
Saying it and doing it
are two different things.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.254
I'm serious.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.290
And whether you believe me or not...

20:18.551 --> 20:20.929
...I've never hurt anyone
who didn't deserve it.

20:21.120 --> 20:25.466
And I have never, ever eaten a human heart.

20:28.127 --> 20:31.734
Guess that explains all the dead
chickens back at the barn?

20:32.298 --> 20:34.039
I eat what I can find.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.110
What people won't miss, hopefully.

20:36.936 --> 20:39.109
Small game, deer.

20:39.305 --> 20:41.148
I meditate.

20:41.407 --> 20:42.613
Yoga helps.

20:42.808 --> 20:44.549
Yoga?

20:45.044 --> 20:46.318
Okay, heh.

20:46.545 --> 20:47.649
You laugh...

20:47.913 --> 20:53.659
...but I'll pretty much try anything
to keep that side of me under control.

20:54.487 --> 20:57.957
Well, that is great, Kate. It really is.

20:58.157 --> 21:01.434
And it's nice to see
that this hippy-dippy, new-age crap...

21:01.627 --> 21:04.836
...has had such a positive influence
over your sister.

21:08.334 --> 21:09.574
Tasha...

21:10.636 --> 21:13.082
She's a different story.

21:14.306 --> 21:18.982
After I left school, I was adrift.

21:19.178 --> 21:20.851
Lost.

21:21.080 --> 21:23.856
Not really sure where to go...

21:24.083 --> 21:26.654
...or what to do.

21:26.852 --> 21:30.356
So I went someplace safe.

21:31.190 --> 21:32.863
I went home.

21:33.125 --> 21:37.005
But even though I'd be good...

21:37.196 --> 21:40.541
...I started to think about my family.

21:41.033 --> 21:42.671
How safe were they going to be?

21:42.868 --> 21:44.870
I was a werewolf.

21:45.471 --> 21:47.974
And then of course, there was you two.

21:48.174 --> 21:50.882
What if you showed up, tried to kill me?

21:52.178 --> 21:53.714
I couldn't risk that.

21:55.347 --> 21:57.657
So I...

21:58.384 --> 22:00.227
...walked away.

22:00.886 --> 22:02.365
Never called.

22:02.555 --> 22:04.159
Never wrote.

22:04.356 --> 22:08.395
Just started a new life.

22:09.028 --> 22:13.636
Until one day I saw a posting
on my sister's Facebook page.

22:13.899 --> 22:17.346
Tasha had been in a
really bad car accident.

22:18.070 --> 22:21.142
The doctors didn't think
she was gonna make it.

22:21.841 --> 22:25.152
We were always so close.

22:25.344 --> 22:30.555
So I had to go say goodbye.

22:36.388 --> 22:37.924
Then...

22:38.257 --> 22:39.861
...it hit me.

22:40.059 --> 22:42.061
This curse that I had...

22:42.261 --> 22:45.401
...that had brought me nothing
but pain and suffering...

22:45.598 --> 22:49.171
...could actually finally
maybe do something good.

22:50.569 --> 22:52.446
If I turned Tasha into a werewolf...

22:53.439 --> 22:55.680
...it would heal her wounds...

22:55.875 --> 22:59.084
...save her life, give her a second chance.

23:00.946 --> 23:02.926
So...

23:03.883 --> 23:07.387
...I did the unthinkable.

23:09.054 --> 23:11.466
At first, I thought I had failed.

23:12.892 --> 23:16.772
That, even though
werewolves heal quickly...

23:16.962 --> 23:19.568
...it was too late for Tasha.

23:20.933 --> 23:22.469
Then she woke up.

23:22.701 --> 23:26.740
Not sick anymore but okay.

23:26.939 --> 23:30.443
Hi. Hey. Hi.

23:30.643 --> 23:32.486
Tasha had so many questions.

23:32.711 --> 23:35.658
What happened? How did she get here?

23:36.815 --> 23:40.262
So I was straight with her.

23:40.452 --> 23:42.591
The good, the bad, the ugly.

23:42.788 --> 23:46.258
Of what we were,
why we could never go back home.

23:46.458 --> 23:50.235
And the responsibility we had
to control what we'd become.

23:50.429 --> 23:54.002
I picked you up from the hospital.
I'm gonna take you someplace safe. Okay?

23:54.233 --> 23:57.112
It was a lot to swallow.

23:57.303 --> 24:01.752
But we had each other,
and that felt like enough.

24:03.676 --> 24:06.520
Or so I thought.

24:34.173 --> 24:39.282
My sister, she gave into everything
that I had warned her about.

24:39.478 --> 24:42.550
And I knew...

24:42.815 --> 24:45.887
...even if I couldn't
bring myself to admit it then...

24:48.821 --> 24:51.529
...I knew I was losing her.

24:51.890 --> 24:53.494
So back at the barn...

24:54.793 --> 24:57.899
...that was all just an
act to protect Tasha?

24:58.897 --> 25:00.877
She's family.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.077
And, yeah...

25:03.335 --> 25:04.837
...worth "eating a bullet" for.

25:07.306 --> 25:09.843
And she needs me more now than ever.

25:10.042 --> 25:14.184
- This is my mess. I gotta clean it up.
- And how do you plan on doing that, Kate?

25:14.380 --> 25:16.155
By getting Tasha out of here.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.191
She hasn't listened to you yet.

25:18.384 --> 25:20.386
Why do you think she's gonna start now?

25:20.652 --> 25:23.656
I don't know, but I've gotta try.

25:23.856 --> 25:25.665
You know, we'll go out into the woods.

25:25.858 --> 25:29.032
Drop out for however long it takes
until she learns to control this.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.872
Little late for team building,
don't you think?

25:32.064 --> 25:33.566
So, what...

25:33.899 --> 25:36.175
...I just abandon her?

25:36.402 --> 25:38.177
I did this.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.543
I owe her every chance to make it right.

25:40.739 --> 25:42.013
What if she never does?

25:45.244 --> 25:46.917
Then I'll take care of it.

25:47.112 --> 25:48.716
You'll take care of it?

25:49.281 --> 25:50.885
You know what that means?

25:51.250 --> 25:53.389
Why don't you ask Brian?

25:56.789 --> 25:58.860
Well, maybe it doesn't
have to come to that.

25:59.758 --> 26:04.400
If you had shot straight with us from the get go,
we might've been able to help you a lot sooner.

26:04.963 --> 26:06.135
What do you mean?

26:06.398 --> 26:08.275
By curing the you both.

26:08.467 --> 26:10.413
Pfft. Shut up.

26:10.969 --> 26:15.782
- Yeah. Okay, or you're welcome.
- There is no cure for werewolves.

26:16.241 --> 26:18.653
And for a long time that was true.

26:18.911 --> 26:20.117
But we found one.

26:21.780 --> 26:23.487
We got everything we need on our end.

26:23.816 --> 26:26.797
Okay? But the clock is ticking.

26:26.985 --> 26:28.430
And we need one more thing.

26:28.620 --> 26:30.156
Tasha.

26:30.489 --> 26:33.095
Unless you wanna do this without her?

26:33.425 --> 26:34.961
No. No. No.

26:36.829 --> 26:40.675
It's along drive,
but I know where to find her.

26:44.470 --> 26:46.780
Dude, what are you doing? There is no cure.

26:48.006 --> 26:51.180
- There's one.
- It's a little more complicated than that.

26:51.410 --> 26:54.289
Kate and Tasha are monsters.
Last I checked, we kill monsters.

26:54.480 --> 26:57.984
How can you blame Kate for fighting
for her sister? We do it all the time.

26:58.183 --> 27:00.686
Well, yeah,
and that's worked wonders for us.

27:00.919 --> 27:02.523
Well, we're still here, aren't we?

27:03.989 --> 27:05.491
Yeah, but is it right?

27:05.691 --> 27:07.830
All you've done for me,
I still got this mark.

27:08.026 --> 27:09.801
We'll figure that out. We always do.

27:09.995 --> 27:14.876
But you can't take whatever's happened to us,
or to you, and dump it at these girls' feet.

27:15.634 --> 27:18.137
All right.
So, what, you wanna nuance this thing?

27:19.505 --> 27:21.382
Hit me. What's your plan?

27:31.984 --> 27:33.520
Kate'?

27:35.387 --> 27:36.730
She's out.

27:36.989 --> 27:39.868
Okay. Then, uh, I gotta tell you something.

27:40.058 --> 27:41.162
I, uh...

27:44.663 --> 27:47.735
- I lied about Lester.
- What?

27:49.468 --> 27:52.039
- There were others.
- Other humans?

27:52.237 --> 27:53.716
No. No. No.

27:53.906 --> 27:58.582
I'm sure there's a few hunters I rubbed...
Or I punched the wrong way.

27:58.844 --> 28:00.255
But...

28:00.579 --> 28:04.356
No. I pretty much saved
my best stuff for the bad guys.

28:04.850 --> 28:07.228
But you gotta understand something, Dean.

28:07.419 --> 28:09.592
I watched you die.

28:09.922 --> 28:14.098
And I carried you. I carried your corpse...

28:14.359 --> 28:18.068
...into your room,
and I put your dead body...

28:18.263 --> 28:22.370
...on your bed, and then you just...

28:23.769 --> 28:26.045
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

28:26.238 --> 28:27.615
I know.

28:29.074 --> 28:32.544
I guess I was hoping that note
would, you know, fill in the blanks.

28:33.111 --> 28:35.387
"Don't look for me"? That note?

28:35.581 --> 28:38.425
Yeah. That was really informative. Thanks.

28:40.519 --> 28:42.965
Yeah. I...

28:43.956 --> 28:45.026
What?

28:46.024 --> 28:47.970
It's embarrassing, you know?

28:48.527 --> 28:50.268
- What's embarrassing?
- All of it.

28:53.131 --> 28:54.735
That note.

28:55.100 --> 28:56.807
Crowley.

28:57.736 --> 28:58.942
Everything.

28:59.271 --> 29:00.648
Dean, you were a demon.

29:00.906 --> 29:03.045
I was a demon'? Oh,
thanks, I didn't realize.

29:03.242 --> 29:04.949
Oh, shut up.

29:09.982 --> 29:12.622
Not to mention
I never even said "thank you," so...

29:17.155 --> 29:18.793
You don't ever have to say that.

29:18.991 --> 29:20.629
Not to me.

29:23.295 --> 29:24.501
Well...

29:26.431 --> 29:28.138
Well, good then. I guess...

29:28.333 --> 29:29.937
I guess it's all gravy.

29:30.669 --> 29:34.173
Little R & R, and we are back at it.

29:37.976 --> 29:39.455
Hey.

29:40.979 --> 29:42.583
How we doing?

29:44.016 --> 29:45.359
We're getting close.

29:47.786 --> 29:49.629
What is this place?

29:49.921 --> 29:53.994
Ever since Tasha and I were little, we've been
coming up to this cabin with our parents.

29:54.192 --> 29:56.172
Why do you think Tasha will even be here?

29:56.361 --> 29:58.841
When she became a wolf,
we knew it would be hard.

29:59.031 --> 30:03.502
So we kind of came up with this escape
plan in case things ever got bad.

30:03.702 --> 30:05.545
So it's a rendezvous spot?

30:06.538 --> 30:07.846
Pretty much.

30:30.896 --> 30:32.637
Now what?

30:32.831 --> 30:36.005
Maybe I should go in first.
Explain all this.

30:36.702 --> 30:38.147
Sounds good.

30:39.071 --> 30:40.914
What are you doing?

30:45.877 --> 30:47.413
You son of a bitch.

30:49.748 --> 30:51.750
There is no cure, is there?

30:53.418 --> 30:54.590
I trusted you.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.597
It's not her fault.

30:59.825 --> 31:01.202
It's mine.

31:01.393 --> 31:04.033
- She killed people.
- Because I did this to her. okay?

31:04.229 --> 31:06.175
If you want your pound of flesh, take me.

31:06.365 --> 31:08.675
- We'll deal with you later.
- But she can be saved.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.278
No.

31:11.603 --> 31:13.742
Tasha's in too deep.

31:13.939 --> 31:16.385
You don't ever come back from that.

31:16.775 --> 31:18.083
Not ever.

31:24.783 --> 31:26.126
Come on, Sammy.

31:26.585 --> 31:28.223
No.

31:28.787 --> 31:30.960
Please don't do this.

31:32.190 --> 31:34.602
Don't.

31:35.594 --> 31:37.596
Please.

31:37.796 --> 31:39.400
Please don't.

32:29.781 --> 32:32.853
I can't believe my own sister betrayed me.

32:33.118 --> 32:34.153
Yeah.

32:34.352 --> 32:36.832
Except she didn't.

32:37.022 --> 32:38.626
You're not gonna shoot me.

32:38.824 --> 32:40.531
And why's that?

32:40.792 --> 32:42.499
Sam.

32:52.804 --> 32:56.183
Drop the gun,
or dreamboat here gets his mind blown.

32:56.374 --> 32:58.285
Don't do it, Sam. Unh!

32:59.845 --> 33:00.880
Well...

33:01.279 --> 33:02.781
"Sammy?

33:11.223 --> 33:12.896
Tasha, what are you...?

33:14.059 --> 33:16.972
- Who are these people?
- Brandon. Travis.

33:17.329 --> 33:18.706
I turned them.

33:19.331 --> 33:20.401
They're our new family.

33:20.632 --> 33:22.509
Yeah. You're a regular psycho Brady Bunch.

33:23.969 --> 33:25.175
Hey.

33:28.740 --> 33:32.210
- No.
- You always had crappy taste in guys.

33:32.410 --> 33:34.515
Tasha, we can talk about this.

33:36.248 --> 33:39.559
They were gonna kill me,
and now you're protecting them?

33:39.751 --> 33:41.856
No. I'm protecting you.

33:42.053 --> 33:44.897
Yeah. I'm good. Thanks.

33:45.090 --> 33:46.569
So here's how it's gonna be:

33:46.758 --> 33:50.228
You can walk away,
or you can join my pack.

33:50.428 --> 33:51.736
I'm not walking away.

33:53.565 --> 33:56.273
Then prove you got what it takes.

33:58.503 --> 33:59.914
Eat his heart out.

34:05.243 --> 34:06.779
Kate.

34:10.014 --> 34:13.393
- You don't have to do this.
- No one's talking to you, Paul Bunyan.

34:19.925 --> 34:21.130
So?

34:23.128 --> 34:25.074
No.

34:27.799 --> 34:29.210
Take them.

34:29.400 --> 34:30.607
Have some fun.

34:30.802 --> 34:32.907
Oh, and I want a heart to go.

34:33.103 --> 34:34.447
Put it in a doggie bag.

34:38.877 --> 34:41.585
- On your knees.
- Wow, I am awfully flattered...

34:47.552 --> 34:49.964
T, I can help you get better.

34:50.155 --> 34:52.897
Oh, I am better and smarter.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.969
And stronger and awesome.

34:56.161 --> 34:58.141
I'm a freaking superhero.

34:58.330 --> 35:00.105
Who kills innocent people?

35:00.732 --> 35:03.144
No. That's not you.

35:03.335 --> 35:04.814
You were a good kid.

35:05.003 --> 35:07.847
I was weak and scared.

35:08.073 --> 35:10.178
I let people walk all over me.

35:10.675 --> 35:14.851
Mom. Dad. Friends. Boyfriends.

35:15.080 --> 35:16.115
You.

35:17.515 --> 35:19.461
But I'm not weak anymore.

35:19.651 --> 35:21.790
And I'm not scared.

35:21.987 --> 35:23.694
I'm scary.

35:24.289 --> 35:26.633
I was trying to give you a second chance.

35:26.825 --> 35:29.101
You wouldn't have been normal...

35:29.294 --> 35:31.171
...but we would have had each other.

35:31.363 --> 35:33.001
We still can.

35:33.198 --> 35:34.939
I'm won't spend life on the run...

35:35.133 --> 35:37.477
...from people like
Mary-Kate and Ashley out there.

35:37.669 --> 35:39.376
We're strong, Kate.

35:39.604 --> 35:41.880
We can go anywhere we want.

35:42.107 --> 35:46.021
We do anything we want,
and if anyone gets in our way...

35:48.546 --> 35:50.651
You don't have to be alone anymore.

35:52.150 --> 35:54.528
We can do this together.

35:54.719 --> 35:56.221
You okay?

35:57.122 --> 35:59.193
- I've been better. These guys, huh?
- Yeah.

35:59.391 --> 36:02.065
- Can you believe them?
- Yeah. A couple of minor leaguers.

36:02.293 --> 36:04.034
Yo, you're dead.

36:04.229 --> 36:06.140
You don't get to talk. In fact...

36:15.674 --> 36:17.244
Welcome to the majors, boys.

36:20.078 --> 36:23.389
Kate, we're gonna be good, okay?

36:25.083 --> 36:27.222
We're gonna be great.

36:27.419 --> 36:28.727
I love you.

36:30.255 --> 36:31.893
I love you too.

36:43.568 --> 36:44.945
I'm sorry.

36:52.043 --> 36:54.045
I'm so sorry.

37:23.608 --> 37:25.713
Are we going after her?

37:28.480 --> 37:30.118
I don't know, Dean.

37:33.585 --> 37:38.000
Well, you gotta admit,
when push came to kill, she did good.

37:39.090 --> 37:40.501
Yeah.

37:41.326 --> 37:43.067
Maybe it's good you didn't shoot her.

37:43.261 --> 37:45.969
Really? You gonna Monday-morning
quarterback this thing?

37:49.300 --> 37:50.779
If you got an itch to scratch...

37:50.969 --> 37:52.312
Dean, look.

37:52.504 --> 37:55.144
We both jumped on this case. I agree.

37:55.340 --> 37:56.842
Equal pans blame there.

37:57.075 --> 38:00.784
But the whole idea
behind laying low was to rest.

38:00.979 --> 38:04.017
To try and deal with everything we...

38:04.249 --> 38:06.126
Everything you went through.

38:07.085 --> 38:08.928
Maybe we jumped back in too fast.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.292
I mean, Dean...

38:10.488 --> 38:11.796
...you were a demon.

38:11.990 --> 38:14.300
You still have the mark.

38:14.492 --> 38:17.098
- Didn't you ever wanna talk about it?
- "Talk about it"?

38:17.295 --> 38:18.603
Talk about it how?

38:18.797 --> 38:20.435
- Come on, man.
- I am coming on, Sam.

38:20.632 --> 38:22.839
Look. I know what happened.

38:23.034 --> 38:25.674
Okay? I was there. Remember?

38:26.771 --> 38:29.342
I'm not trying to get by it. This...

38:29.541 --> 38:33.148
- That's not what this was about.
- Then what is this about?

38:33.878 --> 38:35.687
It's about getting back in the saddle.

38:35.880 --> 38:39.521
Okay? Doing something good,
not stewing in my own crap.

38:41.553 --> 38:43.464
What if you're not ready?

38:54.632 --> 38:58.512
Well, I'll give you one thing,
you're pretty damn good at getaways.

38:58.736 --> 39:02.980
Yeah. Well, I decided living
was better than being dead.

39:03.174 --> 39:05.017
For what it's worth, thank you.

39:05.210 --> 39:07.315
At the end of the day, she was your sister.

39:07.512 --> 39:08.991
No.

39:09.180 --> 39:11.091
She wasn't.

39:14.485 --> 39:15.987
Listen to me, Kate.

39:16.187 --> 39:19.725
You keep moving, keep your nose clean,
we can stop meeting like this.

39:19.924 --> 39:23.531
I hear you, and I will.

39:23.728 --> 39:27.107
But I'm not gonna promise because...

39:29.167 --> 39:30.578
Yeah.

39:31.269 --> 39:32.509
See you around, kid.

39:32.871 --> 39:35.181
I sure as hell hope not.

40:16.114 --> 40:17.718
Let's say you're right.

40:19.918 --> 40:22.626
- About what?
Everything.

40:24.622 --> 40:26.932
Maybe I'm not ready to hunt.

40:30.628 --> 40:33.507
But I'm just trying to
do the right thing, man.

40:34.933 --> 40:38.107
Because I'm so sick and tired
of doing the wrong one.
