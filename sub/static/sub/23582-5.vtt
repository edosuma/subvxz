34:21.357 --> 34:23.558
Let me see it.

34:23.560 --> 34:25.793
Oh, God, we need to clean this.

34:25.795 --> 34:29.163
We'll use hand soap for now.
Come on. Come on.

34:29.974 --> 34:32.132
Arthur, are you calm in there?

34:32.650 --> 34:35.303
I need soap and a towel
and no more bullshit.

34:36.313 --> 34:37.938
Come on, schmuck. Answer me.

34:37.940 --> 34:40.007
Or I'll let Sally have her way with you.

34:41.745 --> 34:44.277
What the (BLEEP)?

34:58.928 --> 35:00.962
Well, shit.

35:06.312 --> 35:09.385
Son of a bitch. God damn it.

35:09.387 --> 35:11.020
This was not supposed to happen.

35:11.022 --> 35:12.455
People were not supposed to die.

35:12.457 --> 35:13.756
He did it to himself.

35:13.758 --> 35:15.024
No, no, this whole thing,

35:15.026 --> 35:17.460
this whole goddamn
thing is out of control.

35:17.462 --> 35:19.095
We're grifters; we're not killers.

35:19.097 --> 35:20.897
Hey, get your shit together,
God damn it.

35:20.899 --> 35:22.699
Calm down.

35:22.701 --> 35:24.901
Maybe you should ask
Heller if we're killers.

35:24.903 --> 35:27.237
And I don't recall you
getting down on your knees

35:27.239 --> 35:29.706
when you put me in that
car with Lenny Cohen.

35:29.708 --> 35:31.241
Rules of the game, Max.

35:31.243 --> 35:32.876
That's how it goes.

35:32.878 --> 35:36.779
So pull yourself together,
and act like a friggin' professional.

35:39.050 --> 35:41.451
<i>And the fullback right up the middle.</i>

35:41.453 --> 35:43.720
<i>Gain of two on the play.</i>

35:43.722 --> 35:45.321
<i>That'll bring up third...</i>

35:45.323 --> 35:47.891
Ah, there's that face.

35:47.893 --> 35:49.459
[laughs] Hi.

35:49.461 --> 35:50.493
[laughs]

35:50.495 --> 35:51.995
Maddie, Dad.

35:51.997 --> 35:53.163
Maddie.

35:53.165 --> 35:54.664
It's so good to see you.

35:55.198 --> 35:56.733
How's my girl?

35:56.735 --> 35:58.735
I'm good, Dad. How are you?

35:58.737 --> 36:00.136
Oh, you know.

36:00.138 --> 36:03.106
Little cabin fever.

36:03.108 --> 36:05.909
Happy to still be watching
the wheels go round and round.

36:05.911 --> 36:08.444
I get it, Dad.

36:08.446 --> 36:10.980
So what's new, hmm? How's Finland?

36:10.982 --> 36:13.249
Uh, Greenland?

36:13.251 --> 36:17.020
You look a little tired, sweetie.

36:17.022 --> 36:20.623
Well, things haven't been so great.

36:20.625 --> 36:22.659
Oh, no? Come on; tell me.

36:22.661 --> 36:27.730
Come into my... my office here.

36:31.002 --> 36:33.136
It's, um...

36:35.273 --> 36:38.274
Dad, I've been working

36:38.276 --> 36:42.545
for a very bad person.

36:42.547 --> 36:47.217
I've done some pretty bad things.

36:47.219 --> 36:49.485
Tricked people,

36:49.487 --> 36:54.357
taken their money, hurt them.

36:54.359 --> 36:57.961
I want to stop.

36:57.963 --> 36:59.996
I want to be free of it.

36:59.998 --> 37:02.665
You've always been so determined.

37:02.667 --> 37:06.035
You know, you... you...
you put your mind into something,

37:06.037 --> 37:08.371
watch out.

37:08.373 --> 37:12.375
Thanks for saying that, Dad.

37:12.377 --> 37:13.543
Hey, can I tell you something?

37:13.545 --> 37:14.657
Mm-hmm.

37:14.746 --> 37:16.372
It's a secret. You can't tell anyone.

37:16.482 --> 37:18.248
Okay.

37:18.340 --> 37:23.653
You know this man I work for,
the Doctor?

37:23.655 --> 37:26.022
I'm gonna kill him.

37:28.159 --> 37:33.663
It's the only way for me to get out,

37:33.665 --> 37:35.231
be free.

37:37.902 --> 37:40.003
Hi.

37:40.005 --> 37:42.905
There's that face.

37:43.908 --> 37:47.844
Hi, Dad.

37:47.846 --> 37:50.046
I'm gonna go downstairs
and check on dinner, okay?

37:50.048 --> 37:51.748
Okay, great.

37:58.696 --> 38:01.090
- Max.
- Hey.

38:06.547 --> 38:08.931
Hold on. Hold on. I'm sorry.

38:12.137 --> 38:14.037
I didn't know what I was walking into.

38:14.039 --> 38:16.272
Ah, don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.

38:16.274 --> 38:18.941
Look, we had a problem here.

38:18.943 --> 38:20.243
I'm very sorry.

38:20.245 --> 38:22.211
It wasn't supposed to go down this way.

38:48.473 --> 38:50.239
What did you do to him?

38:50.241 --> 38:52.308
- Kid...
