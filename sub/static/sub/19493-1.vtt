00:17.347 --> 00:19.230
Police. Is anybody home?

00:25.759 --> 00:28.501
Sir, could you step to the door?

00:35.502 --> 00:37.846
- Yeah.
- Sir, we received a 911 call.

00:37.905 --> 00:40.249
Is everything okay?

00:40.307 --> 00:43.720
My wife was upset. She might have called.

00:43.777 --> 00:46.849
- Everything's fine now.
- Sir, could you open the door?

00:50.451 --> 00:52.397
What's your name, sir?

00:52.453 --> 00:54.763
It's Porter. Rip Porter.

00:55.756 --> 00:58.532
Mr. Porter, could you step inside?

01:06.633 --> 01:08.840
Go ahead and have a seat, sir.

01:11.138 --> 01:12.981
Mr. Porter, is your wife here?

01:14.374 --> 01:16.786
I don't know. She might be upstairs.

01:17.778 --> 01:21.316
Wen. Wendy!

01:23.083 --> 01:25.893
Mrs. Porter? Police.

01:29.490 --> 01:30.992
Wendy?

01:32.993 --> 01:34.995
Mrs. Porter? Police officer.

01:39.366 --> 01:40.902
Mrs. Porter.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.074
Ma'am, are you all right?

01:45.138 --> 01:47.140
- Wen!
- Stop resisting, sir.

01:50.377 --> 01:52.789
Get off! Get off!

01:59.586 --> 02:01.930
Wendy.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.291
Ah.

02:43.330 --> 02:45.332
Just to the right over there.

02:45.399 --> 02:47.345
There you go. Perfect.

02:47.401 --> 02:50.473
See, you want to go
right down the middle of this channel.

02:50.537 --> 02:52.574
Can I drive by myself, Daddy?

02:52.639 --> 02:55.085
You can drive when we
get outside of the marina. Okay, bud?

02:55.142 --> 02:56.644
Okay.

03:02.349 --> 03:03.851
- Hey, Daddy?
- Yep.

03:03.917 --> 03:06.591
Am I just a rookie at this?

03:06.653 --> 03:08.655
What'd you say? A rookie?

03:11.925 --> 03:14.701
- That's a big boat, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

03:14.761 --> 03:17.037
It's, like, 200feet.

03:17.097 --> 03:19.236
Think we're gonna see any fish?

03:19.299 --> 03:23.145
I could give you a mask, throw you
in the water. You'd see plenty of fish.

03:27.941 --> 03:30.148
- You having fun?
- Yeah.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.883
I love you, boy.

03:47.027 --> 03:50.406
Hey, Joey. Should I sing Mommy a tune?
Yeah?

03:50.464 --> 03:52.603
Yes, please sing a tune, sweetheart.

03:52.666 --> 03:55.146
# Molly #

03:55.202 --> 03:57.944
How's that for an intro?

03:58.005 --> 04:00.542
It'd be good if you knew
a few more chords.

04:00.607 --> 04:02.951
Look, Mommy.

04:03.010 --> 04:05.286
What is this? Is this your story?

04:05.345 --> 04:07.416
Yep.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.984
Sweetie, this is beautiful.

04:10.050 --> 04:12.052
Will you help me with the words?

04:12.119 --> 04:15.726
Um, of course, but not right now
because it's time for bed.

04:15.789 --> 04:18.963
But I have to finish my story.

04:19.026 --> 04:21.165
Nice try, kiddo. Go to bed.
Listen to your mama.

04:21.228 --> 04:23.230
Tomorrow, you can finish your story.

04:23.296 --> 04:25.936
Right now it is 7:00,
and you haven't even had a bath yet.

04:25.999 --> 04:27.501
Get Mr. Growls.

04:27.567 --> 04:30.514
- Will you sing a song first?
- A song?

04:31.905 --> 04:34.408
- Daddy, don't do it.
- Joey.

04:34.474 --> 04:38.320
- Don't do it, Daddy. - This is a little
song I wrote for you about bedtime.

04:38.378 --> 04:40.380
Oh, no! He did it!

04:40.447 --> 04:43.485
# Joey, Joey, Joey
better get his butt to bed #

04:43.550 --> 04:48.158
# Or Daddy, Daddy, Daddy's
gonna drop him on his head #

04:48.221 --> 04:50.565
- # Come on #
- Whoa, Daddy.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.570
Kiss your son good night.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.628
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night. Night, Mama.

04:54.695 --> 04:57.266
- See you in a second.
- Okay. You win.

04:57.330 --> 05:00.834
That's right, Son. Daddy always wins.

06:06.266 --> 06:09.679
I just want you to know...

06:11.304 --> 06:13.306
You did the right thing.

06:16.176 --> 06:17.678
Okay?

06:18.812 --> 06:22.954
# I was making a living#

06:23.016 --> 06:24.757
Okay.

06:24.818 --> 06:28.163
# And I forgot to live#

06:28.221 --> 06:31.202
# I've lost you forever#

06:39.366 --> 06:41.437
Father Logan, when I was leaving today-

06:41.501 --> 06:43.447
He wrote down his number, and...

06:43.503 --> 06:47.952
He said we can call him
anytime we need him if we need anything.

06:48.008 --> 06:51.285
So, I just want-
I want you to- I want you to take that.

06:51.344 --> 06:54.587
I want you to-
I want you to hold on to it.

06:54.648 --> 06:57.424
And if, you know, we need to call him...

06:57.484 --> 07:00.590
You just give it to me-

07:01.655 --> 07:04.226
and I'll call him.

07:04.291 --> 07:06.293
That okay?

07:08.228 --> 07:09.605
Okay.

07:10.864 --> 07:13.174
Last night was so terrifying.

07:13.233 --> 07:15.406
I was afraid that I would come out...

07:15.468 --> 07:19.848
And... you wouldn't be there...

07:19.906 --> 07:21.977
That I'd be alone, you know.

07:22.042 --> 07:24.181
Oh, baby.

07:24.244 --> 07:26.417
I told you I'd be there.

07:27.681 --> 07:29.661
Thank you.

07:37.224 --> 07:38.999
- I love this.
- Yeah?

07:39.059 --> 07:41.801
- Little greasy.
- No.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.535
Is that it?

07:49.736 --> 07:52.683
Is there anything you-
anyplace you want to go? Anything-

07:52.739 --> 07:56.846
You know what I'd really like to do,
actually, is go to a craft store.

07:56.910 --> 07:59.151
You're sweet.

08:00.881 --> 08:03.157
Get some yarn and some beads?

08:05.952 --> 08:07.727
I love your hair like that.

08:08.588 --> 08:10.693
Thanks. It's a little darker.

08:10.757 --> 08:12.259
Little bit.

08:20.901 --> 08:22.972
That's neat.

08:39.152 --> 08:41.291
- Come on.
- All right, Joey.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.857
Come on, Joey. Put it right in the glove.

08:43.924 --> 08:45.767
- Strike.
- Stee-rike!

08:45.825 --> 08:47.498
- Yeah.
- Daddy!

08:50.030 --> 08:51.873
- Very nice.
- Dad. Dad, throw it here.

08:51.932 --> 08:55.209
- All right. Pop-up.
- I got it.

08:55.268 --> 08:58.841
Can you see? Look there, little guy.

09:00.473 --> 09:03.079
Oops! Hey.

09:03.143 --> 09:05.714
Ready? Here I go.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.589
- Want some chicken?
- I'm full, honey.

09:10.650 --> 09:12.425
- Are you sure?
- Enough with the meat.

09:12.485 --> 09:15.227
- No, no. Bring it on.
- So how's business, Bill?

09:15.288 --> 09:17.290
Uh, well, you know, it'll pick up.

09:17.357 --> 09:19.030
Well, my offer stilI stands.
You know that.

09:19.092 --> 09:20.662
I know. Thank you. Appreciate it.

09:20.727 --> 09:23.435
Why don't you let Jack help you out, Bill?
It'd be an investment for us.

09:23.496 --> 09:25.635
Look, we're so good. Thank you.

09:25.699 --> 09:28.805
- Have you thought about my offer?
- What's that?

09:28.868 --> 09:32.042
Beth wants to start taking Joey
to church with them.

09:32.105 --> 09:34.051
Really?

09:34.107 --> 09:36.815
Don't you think it's important
that he's raised with good values?

09:36.876 --> 09:39.914
- Sweetheart?
- Excuse me. Need anything?

09:43.683 --> 09:46.459
I got some rib eye coming next.
I'll be right back.

09:46.519 --> 09:48.999
Okay, thanks. Sounds good.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.531
I know. I know.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.503
Hey, buddy.

10:03.770 --> 10:06.649
Hey, buddy, come here. Come on.

10:06.706 --> 10:09.710
Come here.
Hey, look at you! Hey, Camper.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.778
- How you doing?
- Your daddy's home!

10:11.845 --> 10:15.292
Your daddy's home, Camper.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.093
- Honey!
- Phew.

10:18.151 --> 10:19.596
- Are you okay?
- Yep.

10:19.652 --> 10:22.189
- He bit you in the face.
- No, it's-

10:22.255 --> 10:24.360
- Camper, you bad dog!
- He's just doin' his job.

10:24.424 --> 10:26.529
I知 so sorry.
Let's get you cleaned up.

10:30.430 --> 10:32.171
I can't believe that.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.576
What a way to come home, huh?

10:35.769 --> 10:38.306
You know, we're gonna have
two salaries coming in.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.442
We could fix things up a bit here.

10:41.841 --> 10:43.843
- That would be great.
- Yeah.

10:45.712 --> 10:48.989
You know, baby, I was thinking
that once I get settled in...

10:49.049 --> 10:51.620
We save a bit of money...

10:52.619 --> 10:57.227
Um, we could start trying again.

10:57.290 --> 10:58.792
You know?

11:00.827 --> 11:02.829
What do you think?

11:04.431 --> 11:07.412
Do you want to start a family?

11:07.467 --> 11:09.777
Let's start a family.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.338
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.717
It壇 be that new life we talked about.

11:18.711 --> 11:21.055
He could be the new me.

11:22.582 --> 11:24.619
You want a boy?

11:24.684 --> 11:26.186
Yeah.

11:28.888 --> 11:31.391
I think every man wants a son, right?

11:33.927 --> 11:36.339
Come on. Run, Joey. Run!

11:36.396 --> 11:37.875
It's cold.

11:43.903 --> 11:46.747
I telI you, I should get your sister
to come over more often.

11:46.806 --> 11:49.753
Get some dishes done around here.

11:49.809 --> 11:52.585
That's funny.

11:52.645 --> 11:56.616
- I'm just sick of it.
- What's the big deal? Just let him go to church.

11:56.683 --> 12:00.324
Him going or not going is not the issue.
He's our son.

12:00.386 --> 12:03.390
- She has no right.
- Sweetie. Hey.

12:03.456 --> 12:05.800
She's just jealous.

12:05.859 --> 12:08.840
You got all the looks, the talent.

12:08.895 --> 12:11.398
You got me.

12:11.464 --> 12:13.501
- It's perfectly understandable.
- Really?

12:13.566 --> 12:16.137
I知 glad you think this is amusing,
because I don't.

12:21.474 --> 12:23.886
R & B ]
- Rip. What's up, man? How are you?

12:24.878 --> 12:26.824
Yo, Rip.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.621
Who's that?

13:04.417 --> 13:07.261
- This was a great night.
- Yeah.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.425
You look like an angel.

13:11.891 --> 13:14.804
Rip, I need to talk to you
about something.

13:14.861 --> 13:16.204
Yeah?

13:17.564 --> 13:19.066
What?

13:21.534 --> 13:23.207
What is it, baby?

13:26.739 --> 13:29.049
Um-

13:29.108 --> 13:32.112
Whatever it is, it's okay.
You can tell me, you know.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.816
After you went away...

13:38.384 --> 13:40.557
It was so hard for me, Rip.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.566
It was just so hard.

13:42.622 --> 13:44.659
- I know. Honey, I'm sorry.
- No.

13:45.925 --> 13:48.804
I couldn't even find a job at first,
and then, um-

13:52.365 --> 13:54.140
then I-I-

13:56.736 --> 13:59.410
I found out I was pregnant.

14:00.940 --> 14:02.385
You what?

14:02.442 --> 14:05.082
And I didn't want to have an abortion,
because it was-

14:07.146 --> 14:09.490
It was a part of you and me, Rip.

14:11.251 --> 14:13.697
But I just, uh-

14:13.753 --> 14:16.495
I just kept thinking...

14:16.556 --> 14:19.002
About how hard my childhood was...

14:19.058 --> 14:21.595
With- with my father...

14:21.661 --> 14:24.505
And how hard yours was...

14:24.564 --> 14:29.513
And with how things were
between you and me at that time.

14:31.771 --> 14:34.843
I just thought it was better for-

14:40.813 --> 14:43.487
So, my mother, she signed for you.

14:44.784 --> 14:48.561
I gave-
I gave the baby up for adoption.

14:48.621 --> 14:50.294
I gave him away.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.335
Please say something, Rip.

15:03.369 --> 15:05.906
You said "him. "

15:05.972 --> 15:08.612
You said "him. " It was a boy?

15:11.344 --> 15:13.221
I gave him away.

15:13.279 --> 15:15.953
I- I gave away our boy.

15:16.015 --> 15:19.827
I知- I'm so sorry.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.566
This is okay.

15:29.395 --> 15:33.309
I couldn't have been a father, honey-
not then, not the man I was then.

15:34.334 --> 15:37.076
You don't have to say that, sweetheart.

15:38.504 --> 15:40.245
Honey, don't- don't cry.

15:42.308 --> 15:44.845
Baby, we gotta get him back.

15:49.682 --> 15:51.719
We can't.

15:51.784 --> 15:54.094
- We gave him away.
- No.

15:54.153 --> 15:56.861
Baby, I didn't sign anything.
I didn't sign anything.

15:59.392 --> 16:01.770
We need to get our son back.

16:01.828 --> 16:04.934
Okay? I'm gonna make this right for you.

16:06.199 --> 16:09.009
Okay? Come here.
Come here.

16:10.203 --> 16:12.581
- It's okay.
- Oh.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.640
It's okay. All right?

16:17.009 --> 16:18.955
We'll get him back.

16:20.413 --> 16:22.916
Gotta go!
I gotta go! I gotta go!

16:23.950 --> 16:26.226
Careful, sweetie.
You have the eggs.

16:26.285 --> 16:29.232
- Why'd you give me the eggs?
- 'Cause it was the lightest one.

16:29.288 --> 16:32.861
- I gotta pee!
- Okay. Remember to put the toilet seat down.

16:32.925 --> 16:35.599
Put it up first, and then put it down.

16:35.661 --> 16:38.665
I know how to use the toilet, Mommy.

16:44.370 --> 16:48.785
This is Alyson Bower
of the Ohio Department of Child Services.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.843
I'm calling for Mr. and Mrs. -

17:16.469 --> 17:19.348
Your Honor I'd just like to point out..

17:19.405 --> 17:22.352
That this child is in private school...

17:22.407 --> 17:24.354
And he's very well-adjusted.

17:24.410 --> 17:28.050
Whereas, these people, the birth parents,
have no parental experience.

17:28.114 --> 17:31.926
I appreciate it, Mrs. Bower,
but that doesn't change the forgery.

17:37.156 --> 17:39.102
Have a seat.

17:44.096 --> 17:45.803
- Thank you.
- Mrs. Porter?

17:46.866 --> 17:48.675
Who signed these papers?

17:50.670 --> 17:53.241
Well, I assumed my husband did.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.986
- I can explain, Your Honor-
- I wasn't talking to you.

17:57.977 --> 17:59.479
Mrs. Porter.

18:00.847 --> 18:03.589
After Rip was put away...

18:03.649 --> 18:05.754
I decided to adopt out the baby.

18:07.353 --> 18:10.095
And so I took the papers to the prison...

18:11.390 --> 18:13.961
But because Rip and I
weren't on speaking terms...

18:14.026 --> 18:16.529
I gave them to a guard to give to him...

18:16.596 --> 18:20.442
And someone on the inside
must have signed his name.

18:20.500 --> 18:24.607
Let's I find out who did sign those papers,
he's going to the same prison you did.

18:24.670 --> 18:26.172
Yes, sir.

18:26.239 --> 18:27.809
You're going to tell me...

18:27.874 --> 18:31.754
That you didn't know
about the pregnancy or the adoption?

18:31.811 --> 18:34.985
No, sir, not until a couple weeks ago.

18:35.047 --> 18:36.788
And now you want to be a father?

18:38.317 --> 18:40.923
Yes, sir.

18:40.987 --> 18:44.662
Before I was incarcerated,
I was a very different man-

18:44.724 --> 18:49.366
certainly not fit to be
a husband or a father.

18:50.696 --> 18:53.609
And, uh, my alcoholism...

18:53.666 --> 18:56.010
Is a progressive illness...

18:56.068 --> 18:59.208
And healing is lifelong.

19:00.706 --> 19:05.177
And I've spent the last seven years
rehabilitating.

19:05.244 --> 19:08.714
And the one thing
that I've held on to, sir...

19:08.781 --> 19:11.523
Is- is my hope.

19:11.584 --> 19:15.088
My hope for a family...

19:16.756 --> 19:20.670
To repair the damage that I've done...

19:21.761 --> 19:23.707
And my desire to be a father.

19:26.365 --> 19:29.369
She's been in court all day?
What's going on?

19:30.503 --> 19:33.006
Just let me try to talk to her.

19:35.474 --> 19:38.921
Allyson Bower.
Jack Campbell returning your call.

19:41.814 --> 19:44.522
What kind of situation?

19:51.691 --> 19:54.467
Living room, uh, kitchen table.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.336
Got a few fish.

19:56.395 --> 19:59.171
Um- And he's got his own room.

19:59.231 --> 20:01.837
I知 doing a bit of work on it.

20:01.901 --> 20:04.142
Uh, we just got some toys today.

20:04.203 --> 20:07.013
- Yeah, we got him a train set.
- Mm-hmm.

20:07.073 --> 20:09.815
Have you given
any thought to schools?

20:09.875 --> 20:12.617
Yes. The public school's
just down the street here...

20:12.678 --> 20:15.318
And it's got a very good
student-teacher ratio.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.383
I actually went there.
It's a good school.

20:17.450 --> 20:19.760
- So you're a local girl.
- Yeah.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.628
All right. What about his diet?

20:21.687 --> 20:23.428
Yeah. Mom?

20:23.489 --> 20:25.969
I致e actually planned out
all of his meals already.

20:26.025 --> 20:29.336
Um, lots of protein and veggies.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.875
Um, no fried. No fried food.

20:31.931 --> 20:34.275
We're cutting that out.
No more fast food.

20:34.333 --> 20:36.973
- Right.
- I've even made a schedule.

20:37.036 --> 20:38.276
Um- Oh.

20:38.337 --> 20:40.749
These are all child safety locks,
by the way.

20:40.806 --> 20:42.945
Yep. Installed them myself.

20:43.009 --> 20:47.651
Well, there's a lot more
to raising a child than toys and locks.

20:49.148 --> 20:50.650
We know.

20:53.219 --> 20:57.463
Look, I can see that
you've worked really hard...

20:57.523 --> 21:01.471
But that doesn't change the fact
that you are ripping this boy away...

21:01.527 --> 21:04.371
From the only life he's ever known.

21:04.430 --> 21:07.707
He's coming from another world.

21:07.767 --> 21:10.941
Do you have any idea
what that's going to do to him?

21:12.071 --> 21:13.812
Have you thought about it?

21:31.891 --> 21:34.497
I don't understand why this is our problem.
They made the mistake.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.904
They should have notarized the signature.

21:36.962 --> 21:40.000
You're right. You wanna sue Ohio D.C.S.?
We'll probably win.

21:40.066 --> 21:44.310
I don't wanna sue, Tom.
This isn't about money.

21:44.370 --> 21:46.611
But we got a problem.
It's Ohio case law.

21:46.672 --> 21:48.379
It's firm.

21:48.441 --> 21:51.945
There were eight forged adoptions,
all invalidated.

21:52.011 --> 21:56.357
And in every case, the child was returned
to the biological parents.

21:56.415 --> 21:59.123
- This judge has no choice.
- You gotta help me, Tom.

22:00.119 --> 22:03.100
Please. There's gotta be somethin'.

22:05.257 --> 22:07.999
Look, Jack. Listen to me.

22:08.060 --> 22:10.768
We won a lot of battles together,
you and me...

22:11.764 --> 22:14.438
But we're not gonna win this one.

22:16.268 --> 22:19.545
So let me tell you
what I would do if it were me.

22:19.605 --> 22:22.848
I would stop wasting my time
talking to lawyers.

22:24.276 --> 22:25.983
Do you follow me?

22:45.097 --> 22:48.203
The interior's good. Yeah.

22:50.136 --> 22:52.082
All right. We got her.

23:34.280 --> 23:36.351
What do you think?

23:36.415 --> 23:38.224
Wow.

23:38.284 --> 23:40.230
I've been thinking a lot about him.

23:41.854 --> 23:43.527
I just, uh-

23:44.790 --> 23:48.636
I'm scared. I want this
to work out so bad, and-

23:52.064 --> 23:54.237
- Honey.
- Huh?

23:54.300 --> 23:57.042
You're gonna be a great father.

23:59.872 --> 24:02.785
- Jack, how are you?
- Thanks for coming. Please, sit down.

24:05.945 --> 24:10.553
You're talking about reversing the ruling
of an Ohio judge. I have no legal authority.

24:10.616 --> 24:12.755
Curtis, you're a congressman.

24:12.818 --> 24:16.732
Call in some favors for me.
Twist some arms. I know how it works.

24:16.789 --> 24:20.965
It's the state judiciary,
and I can't interfere with that.

24:24.029 --> 24:25.804
What if it was your son?

24:27.333 --> 24:29.313
What if it was Max?
Think about that.

24:30.402 --> 24:31.972
Come on, Jack. That's not fair.

24:32.037 --> 24:35.348
There's a woman coming down here
in three days to take Joey.

24:35.407 --> 24:39.219
- Do you understand that?
- Hey, hey, hey. Calm down.

24:42.514 --> 24:44.994
Look, I realize
it's an election year, okay?

24:45.050 --> 24:47.758
- And these aren't popular cases to be associated with.
- What are you talking about?

24:47.820 --> 24:51.233
This has nothing to do with my political career.
Are you kidding me?

24:51.290 --> 24:55.136
I知 asking you to put yourself
on the line for once...

24:56.528 --> 24:58.701
To save my son.

25:00.733 --> 25:02.076
Look.

25:03.636 --> 25:06.139
I know you're under a lot of pressure.
I know that.

25:06.205 --> 25:07.843
But I'm sorry. I can't.

25:10.576 --> 25:13.056
I壇 like to help you, Jack, but, um...

25:13.112 --> 25:15.023
It's a state matter.

25:15.080 --> 25:17.026
My hands are tied.

25:22.154 --> 25:24.100
I知 sorry.

25:26.558 --> 25:28.231
Send him to your parents.

25:28.294 --> 25:31.366
That's the first place
they'll look, honey.

25:31.430 --> 25:33.933
Well, if he's not here
when they get here, what-

25:33.999 --> 25:36.707
Then they'll send us to jail.

25:36.769 --> 25:38.612
What good are we then?

25:43.275 --> 25:45.619
We have to send him on the first visit.

25:46.645 --> 25:49.148
Just until I can figure something out.

25:55.154 --> 25:57.395
Let me see these feet.

25:57.456 --> 25:59.527
- Ow!
- Oh!

25:59.591 --> 26:01.901
Hey, you count one, two, three,
all right?

26:02.728 --> 26:04.105
- One-
- Two.

26:04.163 --> 26:05.574
Three.

26:05.631 --> 26:06.735
Oh!

26:06.799 --> 26:09.973
Ouch, Mama.

26:10.035 --> 26:12.208
That was a good one.

26:12.271 --> 26:14.478
It was all-

26:14.540 --> 26:17.282
Crack, crack, crack.

26:17.343 --> 26:19.789
Hey, Joey. Hey, Joe.

26:19.845 --> 26:21.791
I want to telI you something.

26:25.150 --> 26:26.993
You're gonna go on a little trip...

26:28.887 --> 26:30.594
To a place called Ohio.

26:30.656 --> 26:32.966
All right?

26:33.025 --> 26:35.005
Where's Ohio?

26:37.463 --> 26:39.875
It's pretty far,
so you're gonna have to take a plane.

26:39.932 --> 26:41.934
But remember, you love planes, right?

26:42.835 --> 26:45.008
Why do I have to go?

26:45.070 --> 26:47.311
Well...

26:47.373 --> 26:53.051
There's this woman,
and she's really nice.

26:53.112 --> 26:56.719
You don't remember her, but she knew you
when you were a little baby.

26:56.782 --> 27:01.231
And she asked
if you could come for a visit...

27:04.189 --> 27:05.862
And Daddy and I said yes.

27:08.060 --> 27:09.630
Hey, Joey.

27:11.330 --> 27:14.937
Everything's gonna be fine, all right?

27:15.000 --> 27:16.946
You got nothing to be afraid of.

27:17.002 --> 27:19.141
Look at me, buddy. Hey.

27:19.204 --> 27:21.912
You got nothing to be afraid of.

27:21.974 --> 27:24.511
I want you to come with me.

27:29.381 --> 27:31.190
I can't.

27:36.922 --> 27:38.595
Aah!

27:44.897 --> 27:47.036
I wanna stay here with you.

27:52.071 --> 27:54.108
You listen to me.

27:54.173 --> 27:57.586
Your mother and I
will always be with you...

27:57.643 --> 27:59.645
No matter where you go.

28:00.679 --> 28:02.522
You understand that?

28:02.581 --> 28:04.527
Hmm?

28:05.617 --> 28:07.119
Okay.

28:11.290 --> 28:13.236
I love you.

29:19.892 --> 29:22.133
Ms. Bower.

29:31.537 --> 29:33.915
Good morning.

29:42.548 --> 29:45.324
Mr. and Mrs. Campbell, I'm very sorry.

29:45.384 --> 29:47.523
I know this must be difficult.

29:47.586 --> 29:49.930
"Difficult"?

29:49.988 --> 29:52.491
Do they teach you to say that,
Ms. Bower?

29:54.626 --> 29:58.836
There are a couple of things
I need to go over with you.

29:58.897 --> 30:03.368
This has the itinerary
and all of my information in it.

30:03.435 --> 30:06.848
Now, on the first visit...

30:06.905 --> 30:11.320
We're gonna tell Joey
that the Porters are just friends.

30:11.376 --> 30:15.188
The next time, we'll refer to them
as "the other Mommy and Daddy. "

30:15.247 --> 30:19.286
And on the final visit,
he'll be told the truth.

30:19.351 --> 30:21.991
Do you have children, Mrs. Bower?

30:23.355 --> 30:25.665
Yes. Yes, I do.

30:25.724 --> 30:27.829
And I am very sorry.

30:27.893 --> 30:30.737
All right, all right.
What if something happens?

30:30.796 --> 30:32.969
- I'm sorry?
- Ms. Bower.

30:33.031 --> 30:35.409
I know why Rip Porter went to prison.

30:35.467 --> 30:39.415
Mr. Porter's had years of rehabilitation-

30:39.471 --> 30:41.144
and anger management.

30:41.206 --> 30:42.708
Come on.

30:42.774 --> 30:45.721
And the court
has deemed him a fit parent.

30:46.778 --> 30:50.225
Now, I've personally been to their home.

30:50.282 --> 30:53.195
- It's a suitable environment.
- A suitable environment?

30:56.788 --> 30:59.325
Joey's not going anywhere.
You can leave now, Ms. Bower.

31:02.160 --> 31:04.197
Good-bye.

31:05.297 --> 31:08.039
Mr. Campbell,
I understand your frustration...

31:08.100 --> 31:10.671
But it's either me...

31:10.736 --> 31:13.148
Or two uniformed police officers.

31:13.205 --> 31:14.980
I致e done it both ways.

31:15.040 --> 31:18.852
Believe me, this way is best for Joey.

31:21.146 --> 31:22.648
Ms. Bower...

31:24.483 --> 31:28.488
If anything happens to my son
while I'm clearing this mess up...

31:28.553 --> 31:31.090
I知 gonna hold you personally responsible.

31:31.156 --> 31:33.796
Jack. Jack.

31:35.360 --> 31:37.306
Come here, baby.

31:40.532 --> 31:44.412
Good morning.
You must be Joey. I'm Allyson.

31:44.469 --> 31:46.540
Hey, sweetie?

31:46.605 --> 31:48.949
- Listen to Mom, okay?
- No.

31:49.007 --> 31:51.578
- This is the woman that's
gonna take you to Ohio. - No!

31:51.643 --> 31:53.987
- It's okay, sweetie.
- No!

31:54.046 --> 31:56.788
Baby, it's gonna be okay.
Mommy and Daddy love you so much.

31:56.848 --> 32:00.386
- I don't wanna go! - It's gonna be okay.
We'll be right here when you get back.

32:00.452 --> 32:04.366
- Will you give me a moment with my family?
- Of course.

32:05.957 --> 32:07.630
Come here, sweetie.

32:15.067 --> 32:17.104
We have to put your jacket on.

32:25.711 --> 32:27.349
Listen.

32:27.412 --> 32:29.858
I want you to be a big boy, okay?

32:31.316 --> 32:34.354
Okay, you be brave.
I know you can.

32:37.489 --> 32:39.730
I wanna stay with you.

32:52.738 --> 32:55.719
Will you come with me to the airplane?

32:55.774 --> 32:59.221
We can't go with you to the airplane.

32:59.277 --> 33:02.258
- I'm gonna take you to the car, okay?
- No.

33:02.314 --> 33:04.658
- I'm sorry.
- Please, I don't want to go.

33:04.716 --> 33:07.219
Please don't take me.
I don't wanna go!

33:07.285 --> 33:09.856
No, I don't wanna go!

33:18.296 --> 33:20.435
Rip, they're here.

33:20.499 --> 33:22.001
They're here.

33:31.877 --> 33:34.824
- He's got your eyes.
- Yeah?

33:34.880 --> 33:37.326
- Ain't that somethin'?
- Hello.

33:38.417 --> 33:41.421
Let me get the gate for ya.

33:49.428 --> 33:50.930
Ready?

33:55.934 --> 33:59.279
Mr. and Mrs. Porter, this is Joey.

33:59.337 --> 34:00.748
Hi there.

34:00.806 --> 34:04.276
What a big, handsome boy you are.

34:04.342 --> 34:07.016
Welcome to our home.

34:07.078 --> 34:08.784
Can I give you a hug?

34:23.829 --> 34:26.206
This is my wife, Wendy...

34:26.264 --> 34:27.766
And, uh...

34:29.167 --> 34:31.340
My name's Richard.

34:31.402 --> 34:34.976
Some people call me Rip.
You can call me whatever you want.

34:36.440 --> 34:39.284
- Nice to meet you.
- Joey?

34:39.344 --> 34:42.257
Rip and Wendy are your new friends.

34:42.313 --> 34:45.556
Now, you need to listen to them
and obey them...

34:45.617 --> 34:47.722
Just as you would your parents.

34:47.786 --> 34:49.288
You understand?

34:51.857 --> 34:54.393
Is that your suitcase?
Can I get it for you?

34:54.458 --> 34:58.305
Oh, wow!
You got an elephant in there?

34:58.363 --> 35:02.209
You wanna see your room?
I fixed it up myself for you.

35:04.636 --> 35:08.379
Oh, hey, we got a dog
in the back named Camper.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.545
- I got a dog named Gus.
- In the backyard there.

35:10.609 --> 35:12.350
Yeah? Well, come on in.

35:12.410 --> 35:14.651
I need you to sign right there.

35:16.882 --> 35:20.420
Thank you for everything.

35:20.485 --> 35:23.022
Just remember that he's six
and in a new world.

35:23.088 --> 35:25.090
I値l check in tomorrow.

35:33.365 --> 35:35.845
I want their address, Tom.
I want to know where he works.

35:35.901 --> 35:38.404
Give me his rap sheet,
anything else you can get your hands on.

35:38.470 --> 35:40.143
I need this done, and I need it now.

35:40.205 --> 35:42.811
- You understand?
- You need to be careful Court orders-

35:42.874 --> 35:46.845
I've been careful, Tom, and Joey's gone.

35:46.912 --> 35:49.552
- Now, please.
- Okay I'll take care of it

35:54.819 --> 35:57.823
I'm gonna go to Ohio
and see what this guy wants.

36:05.864 --> 36:08.140
- Whoa! This is so cool!
- Yeah?

36:08.199 --> 36:10.873
Wait. Check this out.

36:10.936 --> 36:13.041
For bringing up lunch.

36:13.104 --> 36:14.583
Oh, yeah.

36:14.639 --> 36:16.380
Get up on top.

36:16.441 --> 36:17.749
- Ready?
- Yep.

36:17.809 --> 36:21.018
All right.
Okay, you're gonna put it in up here.

36:21.079 --> 36:22.752
Watch my fingers.

36:22.814 --> 36:25.852
Give her a good smack.
There you go.

36:29.387 --> 36:32.664
- Oh!
- Yeah!

36:32.724 --> 36:35.728
- One, two, three.
- Camper. Go get it!

36:35.794 --> 36:37.705
- Cookies!
- Hey!

36:37.762 --> 36:39.264
Actually, sorry.

36:39.331 --> 36:40.935
No girls allowed.

36:40.999 --> 36:44.003
Aw. I guess I'm gonna
have to take them back then.

36:44.069 --> 36:46.071
You have some cookies, so you can come up.

36:46.137 --> 36:48.947
- I guess you can come up if
you have cookies. - Okay.

36:52.243 --> 36:55.713
So, little Joe, what do you like to do?

36:55.780 --> 36:57.726
I mostly like to sail.

36:57.782 --> 36:59.784
I know how to steer a boat myself.

36:59.851 --> 37:02.229
Do your mom and dad have a boat?

37:02.287 --> 37:06.565
Yeah, a big sailboat.
But it also has a motor.

37:06.625 --> 37:08.571
- Mmm.
- You know what we could do?

37:08.627 --> 37:10.766
We could go up to Dillon Lake tomorrow.

37:10.829 --> 37:13.673
They got these little boats
that you can rent. You can steer it.

37:13.732 --> 37:16.212
- How 'bout that?
- Yeah, that could be fun.

37:18.370 --> 37:20.646
I知 done with my cookies now.

37:20.705 --> 37:23.618
So, ready to take a shower, little man?

37:25.076 --> 37:27.682
I don't like showers.

37:27.746 --> 37:31.091
Listen, you gotta get cleaned up
before bed, right?

37:31.149 --> 37:33.390
Can't go to bed dirty.

37:33.451 --> 37:35.397
I don't wanna shower.

37:35.453 --> 37:38.024
I just wanna go home.

37:38.089 --> 37:39.966
Can I please go home?

37:41.693 --> 37:43.400
Babe, you know what?

37:43.461 --> 37:48.410
What you could do
is go to the bathroom with Wendy...

37:48.466 --> 37:50.412
And just wash up your face and hands...

37:50.468 --> 37:54.006
And, you know, maybe that'll
make you feel better.

37:54.072 --> 37:56.018
- Yeah.
- Okay? All right?

37:56.074 --> 37:58.520
That's a great idea.

37:58.576 --> 38:01.750
But, um, next time...

38:01.813 --> 38:03.850
You gotta take a shower, okay?

38:04.916 --> 38:07.260
Okay.

38:07.318 --> 38:09.457
- Hey, let's test the rope swing.
- Yeah!

38:09.521 --> 38:10.795
- All right.
- Oh, boy.

38:10.855 --> 38:12.596
- Ready?
- Have fun.

38:12.657 --> 38:14.330
All right.

38:14.392 --> 38:17.965
Yee-haw!

38:18.029 --> 38:20.703
- Whoo!
- That's pretty cool.

38:22.667 --> 38:25.011
Help!

38:25.070 --> 38:26.981
Hoo-hoo! Whoo!

38:27.038 --> 38:29.143
- All right. Your turn.
- Okay.

38:29.207 --> 38:31.209
What a cute nose you have.

38:32.444 --> 38:34.446
Is it kind of upturned?

38:36.047 --> 38:38.425
Kind of like mine.

39:22.794 --> 39:24.296
Hmm.

39:28.133 --> 39:30.079
It's grape juice.

39:31.436 --> 39:32.938
Non-fermented.

39:35.640 --> 39:37.142
A toast...

39:39.043 --> 39:41.546
To my perfect wife...

39:41.613 --> 39:43.650
And my perfect son.

39:57.495 --> 39:59.941
You know...

39:59.998 --> 40:03.946
I致e been thinkin' a lot
about the day that he was born...

40:04.002 --> 40:08.178
And how I felt when they
took him away from me...

40:09.908 --> 40:11.854
Out of my arms...

40:13.645 --> 40:16.751
And how I was never gonna...

40:16.815 --> 40:19.318
See his little head again...

40:19.384 --> 40:21.193
Or smell his skin.

40:21.252 --> 40:24.358
Hey. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

40:24.422 --> 40:25.924
It's okay.

40:28.426 --> 40:30.838
Nobody-

40:30.895 --> 40:34.866
Nobody's gonna take him
away from us again, okay?

40:36.267 --> 40:38.144
I know.

40:38.203 --> 40:39.705
It's okay.

40:39.771 --> 40:42.581
It's just, um...

40:42.640 --> 40:46.554
His mother must be feeling
the same way I did, maybe worse.

40:48.980 --> 40:50.653
Yeah.

40:52.884 --> 40:56.388
But, babe, somebody's gonna lose.

40:57.822 --> 41:00.325
It's not gonna be us this time.

41:01.392 --> 41:03.565
You are his mother...

41:05.163 --> 41:07.165
And we are his parents...

41:09.200 --> 41:11.703
And it's right for him to be with us.

41:14.072 --> 41:15.779
Okay?

41:15.840 --> 41:17.786
- Okay.
- Just remember.

41:18.776 --> 41:20.016
Appreciate dinner thank you.

41:20.278 --> 41:21.814
Yeah, of course.

41:28.820 --> 41:31.960
So, did Beth mention that we're going away
in a few weeks to Haiti?

41:32.023 --> 41:34.025
- Mm-mmm.
- Yeah.

41:34.092 --> 41:35.833
What's in Haiti?

41:35.894 --> 41:38.397
- We're gonna take the kids on their
first mission trip. - Oh, yeah?

41:38.463 --> 41:40.704
Yeah, we got our new church
to sponsor an orphanage...

41:40.765 --> 41:42.711
That we've been working with
in Port-au-Prince...

41:42.767 --> 41:45.714
And this year we're gonna help 'em
renovate the compound.

41:45.770 --> 41:47.909
We were thinking that
if you guys wanna come...

41:47.972 --> 41:50.350
It might be a good time to get away.

41:51.776 --> 41:54.723
Or Bill can take the kids,
and I can stay here with you.

41:54.779 --> 41:56.759
- You know, it's really whatever you want.
- Stop!

41:56.814 --> 41:58.487
- What, guys?
- Mom, he's writing on my homework.

41:58.549 --> 42:00.085
- I did not.
- Yeah, you did.

42:00.151 --> 42:03.064
- Not tonight.
- Yeah, you know what? I think it's time for bed.

42:05.256 --> 42:07.202
Right now, please.

42:08.393 --> 42:10.999
- Good night, Uncle Jack.
- Good night.

42:12.797 --> 42:14.572
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Dad.

42:14.632 --> 42:19.377
It's really good for them to see
what other parts of the world can be like.

42:19.437 --> 42:21.110
Maybe you should take them to Ohio.

42:28.212 --> 42:30.453
When does he come back?

42:30.515 --> 42:32.552
He comes back tomorrow afternoon.

42:32.617 --> 42:34.995
And then he goes again in two weeks...

42:35.053 --> 42:37.624
And the next time
he doesn't come back at all.

43:17.695 --> 43:19.697
Hey!

43:21.432 --> 43:23.605
- Hi, buddy!
- What's goin' on, J.?

43:23.668 --> 43:26.672
- Oh! Mmm! I missed you.
- Hi, Dad.

43:27.772 --> 43:30.514
- Mmm!
- Look what Wendy gave me.

43:30.575 --> 43:31.918
Wow.

43:36.347 --> 43:38.953
He says it went all right.

43:53.398 --> 43:56.868
And we went to a lake,
and I steered a paddleboat all by myself.

43:56.934 --> 43:59.005
And I didn't want to take a shower...

43:59.070 --> 44:01.448
But Wendy said if I did next time...

44:01.506 --> 44:05.352
She'd get me my own DVD for my room.

44:05.410 --> 44:07.412
- Was Wendy nice to you?
- Yeah.

44:07.478 --> 44:10.687
Wendy was really nice.
She cooks good too.

44:11.649 --> 44:15.062
- How was Rip?
- Good. He's really funny.

44:15.119 --> 44:17.360
We're building a tree house...

44:17.422 --> 44:21.529
And we cut part
of Wendy's pillowcase out...

44:21.592 --> 44:24.630
And then we spray-painted
a skull and crossbone.

44:24.695 --> 44:29.269
And we have a bucket
that, like, she can put something in...

44:29.333 --> 44:32.143
And then we pull it up with the rope.

44:32.203 --> 44:34.308
It's so cool.

44:34.372 --> 44:36.045
They're bribing him.

44:36.107 --> 44:38.781
I never thought
he'd actually want to go back.

44:38.843 --> 44:41.517
- What if he wants to be with them?
- He's six years old.

44:41.579 --> 44:44.492
What if he has some deep connection
to these people?

44:44.549 --> 44:46.859
- Like, he feels that-
- He doesn't even know them.

44:46.918 --> 44:48.864
He came from them, Jack.

44:48.920 --> 44:50.991
Mom, I'm done with my bath.

44:56.294 --> 44:59.002
All right. I'm gonna go to Ohio
first thing in the morning.

45:09.941 --> 45:11.887
- Yo, Rip.
- Yo!

45:11.943 --> 45:14.446
- See you Sunday.
- See you Sunday.

45:16.781 --> 45:18.454
Peace out, man.

45:18.516 --> 45:20.018
- Take it easy.
- See you later.

45:20.084 --> 45:21.757
See you later.

45:33.931 --> 45:35.672
Mr. Porter.

45:36.701 --> 45:38.305
Yeah.

45:38.369 --> 45:41.145
I知 Jack Campbell, Joey's father.

45:54.352 --> 45:57.231
It's good to meet you, Jack.

46:01.692 --> 46:04.070
How much do you want, Rip?

46:05.863 --> 46:07.467
Come again?

46:07.532 --> 46:10.843
This is an amendment
to the original adoption.

46:10.902 --> 46:15.214
You sign this,
I give you half a million dollars in cash.

46:16.841 --> 46:18.343
Here.

46:26.584 --> 46:29.087
- That's a whole lot of money, Jack.
- Yes, sir.

46:31.455 --> 46:34.026
You sign it, I pay you,
and we walk away.

46:34.091 --> 46:35.764
What do you say?

46:44.368 --> 46:47.542
You come up
with $500,000 in cash, Jack...

46:49.540 --> 46:51.850
I知 betting you could
come up with a million.

46:54.979 --> 46:57.653
Okay. Make it a million.

46:57.715 --> 47:00.662
That was fast.
That was fast, Jack.

47:00.718 --> 47:02.720
- Let's make it a million.
- Yeah?

47:02.787 --> 47:05.131
Boy, you said that so fast...

47:05.189 --> 47:07.362
I figure you can come up with two.

47:10.528 --> 47:12.201
Fine. Just sign it.

47:14.432 --> 47:16.912
Two million dollars.

47:16.968 --> 47:19.574
Then I'd be just like you, Jack.

47:19.637 --> 47:21.810
Big house...

47:21.872 --> 47:24.580
Big boat and big shot, huh?

47:24.642 --> 47:26.986
Yeah, that's right.
You can be anything you want, Rip.

47:27.044 --> 47:28.751
Anything at all.

47:36.254 --> 47:39.064
What do you want, Rip?
What do you want?

47:39.123 --> 47:41.296
I want my son, okay?

47:41.359 --> 47:44.431
And you can't have him,
not for no money.

47:44.495 --> 47:47.840
Not two million, not 10 million,
'cause my son ain't for sale.

47:47.898 --> 47:50.276
Whoa, whoa, hold on.
Rip, listen to me one second.

47:50.334 --> 47:53.713
Just listen to me. Please. Please.

47:53.771 --> 47:56.251
With that kind of money,
you could start over.

47:56.307 --> 47:59.049
You could have as many kids as you want.
You understand?

47:59.110 --> 48:01.886
What am I, a dog?
You don't know me.

48:01.946 --> 48:04.187
You don't know me.
What, you can't have any kids?

48:04.248 --> 48:07.286
You got no bullets
in your gun, big shot, huh?

48:12.356 --> 48:15.098
You don't know me!
You don't know me!

48:18.329 --> 48:20.570
- You-
- I'll send you back to prison, you hear me?

48:20.631 --> 48:24.078
You're going to prison!
You're the one violating the court order!

48:24.135 --> 48:26.911
Either way, you can't have my son.

49:53.057 --> 49:54.730
What happened?

49:56.293 --> 49:58.534
He doesn't want the money.

49:59.897 --> 50:02.002
He wants Joey.

50:02.066 --> 50:05.070
Jack, he can't do this.
He assaulted you.

50:05.136 --> 50:07.138
We call the police.
We file a report.

50:07.204 --> 50:09.377
Molly.

50:09.440 --> 50:11.420
It won't work.

50:11.475 --> 50:12.977
Why not?

50:14.645 --> 50:17.148
Because if I report him...

50:17.214 --> 50:19.592
I go to jaiI too.

50:26.223 --> 50:27.725
Okay.

50:30.361 --> 50:32.307
What do we do?

50:40.438 --> 50:42.111
I don't know.

50:43.174 --> 50:45.450
I don't know.

50:47.411 --> 50:49.084
You don't know?

50:52.049 --> 50:53.960
That's it?

50:54.018 --> 50:57.295
You try to buy him off,
it doesn't work, and now you're done?

50:59.757 --> 51:01.668
What else do you want me to do?

51:01.725 --> 51:04.365
You tell me.
What else should I do, Molly?

51:04.428 --> 51:07.034
I don't know- something, anything.

51:07.097 --> 51:09.737
You're his father.
You don't just give up.

51:09.800 --> 51:12.303
I知 not giving up!
I've done everything!

51:14.438 --> 51:16.440
I don't care what it takes.

51:16.507 --> 51:18.953
I知 not giving up my son.

51:19.009 --> 51:21.387
You know what?
You're something, you know?

51:21.445 --> 51:24.449
- I'm not giving up my son!
- Look at my face!

51:24.515 --> 51:26.825
Look at me!

51:26.884 --> 51:29.421
What a horrible father I am.

51:33.858 --> 51:35.860
I致e done everything, Molly.

51:37.127 --> 51:39.129
Why don't you do something?

51:41.665 --> 51:43.338
Do something.

51:45.336 --> 51:47.282
I知 going to bed.

51:59.049 --> 52:03.020
Please! Don't take my baby.

52:19.069 --> 52:20.810
- Oh, baby.
- I know.

52:20.871 --> 52:23.681
- I'm sorry.
- You don't need this, darling.

52:25.442 --> 52:27.888
Baby, don't. I do. I just need it.

52:27.945 --> 52:30.516
- I know. This is not gonna fix things.
- No, no, no, no!

52:30.581 --> 52:32.458
Don't, don't, don't! No, no, no!

52:32.516 --> 52:35.360
Hey! Don't!

52:39.823 --> 52:43.600
Honey, you don't need that.
You don't need that anymore.

52:43.661 --> 52:44.867
Please, baby? You don't need to.

52:44.929 --> 52:46.966
Please, no.

52:56.907 --> 53:00.514
- Get- Get out.
- No, no. Baby, no. No, please.

53:00.578 --> 53:04.151
I love you so much.

53:04.214 --> 53:07.058
Please tell me you've changed, baby.
Please.

53:07.117 --> 53:08.528
Please.

53:08.586 --> 53:10.759
I- I lost seven years.

53:45.990 --> 53:47.799
You gonna be okay, buddy?

53:47.858 --> 53:50.771
Yeah. We're gonna paint my tree house.

53:52.029 --> 53:54.873
- Joey, you ready to go?
- Yeah.

53:54.932 --> 53:56.775
Bye, Dad.

53:57.534 --> 53:59.036
I love you.

53:59.103 --> 54:01.208
I love you too.

54:07.311 --> 54:09.689
- Put your seat belt on, bud.
- Okay.

54:19.023 --> 54:21.025
Bye, sweetie.

54:24.995 --> 54:26.565
- Paw.
- Nice.

54:26.630 --> 54:29.668
One, two, three!

54:29.733 --> 54:30.643
- Ha, ha!
- Whoo-hoo!

54:30.701 --> 54:32.339
You stacked his deck.

54:32.403 --> 54:35.577
Hey, just one thing, so I can remember.

54:35.639 --> 54:37.414
Let's you had a birthday coming up...

54:37.474 --> 54:39.579
What would you want to eat
on your birthday?

54:40.477 --> 54:44.254
A- A chicken cake.

54:44.314 --> 54:46.089
Chicken cake?
Chicken-flavored cake?

54:46.150 --> 54:48.721
- Chicken with cake.
- Chicken with cake?

54:48.786 --> 54:52.097
- A chicken cake. - You want a cake
made in the shape of a chicken?

54:52.156 --> 54:54.295
- No.
- You want chicken inside the cake?

54:54.358 --> 54:56.964
- Chicken inside the cake.
- All right, I'm gonna file that away.

54:57.027 --> 54:58.597
All right, let's go.

55:00.597 --> 55:02.042
One, two, three.

55:03.267 --> 55:04.940
- Joker! I win.
- I win!

55:05.002 --> 55:07.642
You won? I thought joker
was better than everything.

55:07.705 --> 55:09.184
No. That was before.

55:09.239 --> 55:11.742
- Before what?
- When I had joker.

55:14.211 --> 55:16.191
Reminds me of someone.

55:16.246 --> 55:19.489
All right, card shark,
ready to hop in the shower?

55:19.550 --> 55:22.588
I don't want to take a shower.

55:22.653 --> 55:24.894
Oh, we gotta get you clean somehow.

55:24.955 --> 55:27.060
Look at you. P. U.

55:27.124 --> 55:28.728
P. U. to you.

55:28.792 --> 55:32.035
Now, listen, we gotta get you in there
and get you cleaned up.

55:32.096 --> 55:35.543
Remember we talked?
We got different rules here.

55:35.599 --> 55:38.910
I need you to go
and jump in the shower. Okay?

55:41.105 --> 55:43.210
You can do it.

55:44.708 --> 55:46.745
You know what?
Why don't I take care of it?

55:46.810 --> 55:48.812
Honey, don't spoil him.

55:48.879 --> 55:51.052
- I'm not spoiling him. It's just that-
- It's fine.

55:51.115 --> 55:53.356
- It's just that I think that-
- He's a big boy.

55:53.417 --> 55:56.330
You're a big boy. Come on.
Get your gear. Let's go.

56:00.090 --> 56:01.433
Come on, bud.

56:04.128 --> 56:05.436
Hop in the shower.

56:05.496 --> 56:07.339
I don't wanna take a shower.

56:08.899 --> 56:12.073
Doesn't work like that
here, buddy. Come on.

56:12.136 --> 56:13.911
I need you to obey me...

56:13.971 --> 56:16.008
And I need you to get in the bathroom.

56:16.073 --> 56:19.020
You know, I think that you're
really upsetting him now.

56:19.076 --> 56:22.182
No, you know what? I'm-I'm-
I'm actually the one who's getting upset.

56:22.246 --> 56:23.850
- So would you just-
- Okay.

56:23.914 --> 56:25.951
Come here.
Come here, sweetie.

56:26.016 --> 56:27.859
Here, we'll go together, okay?

56:27.918 --> 56:29.659
It'll be fun, all right? Come on.

56:31.922 --> 56:34.368
Let's go, Joey.

56:34.424 --> 56:36.802
Please, sweetheart.
It's only water.

56:36.860 --> 56:38.237
It's nothin'.

56:38.295 --> 56:40.400
Come on. What are you doing?

56:40.464 --> 56:42.808
Come on, buddy, in the shower.

56:42.866 --> 56:44.743
- Come on.
- I don't wanna take a shower.

56:44.802 --> 56:47.214
- He's really scared of it.
He's really scared. - It'll be fun.

56:47.271 --> 56:49.342
- I don't think we should push him.
- He's a big boy, baby.

56:49.406 --> 56:51.181
He's not made of sugar.
He's not gonna melt.

56:51.241 --> 56:53.847
- I don't wanna take a shower.
- Just take your shirt off, and let's get going.

56:53.911 --> 56:55.618
- No.
- You wanna do it together?

56:55.679 --> 56:59.388
We'll do it with our clothes on.
Come on. It'll be fun. Whoo!

56:59.449 --> 57:01.952
Come on. You ready?
Whoo-hoo!

57:02.019 --> 57:04.727
Rip, what are you doing?
Rip, stop it!

57:04.788 --> 57:06.961
Stop that!

57:07.024 --> 57:09.527
- Rip, this is not fun! You're scaring him!
- Right?

57:09.593 --> 57:11.504
- It's okay. We're having fun.
- It's not okay!

57:11.562 --> 57:13.439
It's not fun. You're scaring him.

57:13.497 --> 57:16.171
- He's okay, baby. He's okay. He's fine.
- He's not!

57:16.233 --> 57:19.339
- Rip, you're hurting him!
Rip, you're hurting him! - Ow!

57:19.403 --> 57:20.746
- Stop! You're hurting him!
- Okay.

57:20.804 --> 57:22.943
- This is hurting him. Stop it.
- You okay?

57:30.247 --> 57:32.386
- You're okay.
- No!

57:32.449 --> 57:35.089
You hurt him.

57:37.321 --> 57:39.858
Listen, listen.

57:39.923 --> 57:41.925
I need to telI you something, okay?

57:44.228 --> 57:47.300
Wendy- Wendy is your real mommy.

57:47.364 --> 57:49.605
- Rip, not now.
- Shh, baby.

57:49.666 --> 57:52.374
This is not the right time.

57:52.436 --> 57:54.245
- And I'm your real daddy, okay?
- No, you're not.

57:54.304 --> 57:56.181
And you came here to live with us.

57:56.240 --> 57:58.447
- No, you're not!
- Yes, I am.

57:58.508 --> 58:00.818
- I'm your real daddy, and this
is your real mommy. - Rip.

58:00.878 --> 58:03.950
- I wanna see my daddy!
- I am your daddy.

58:04.014 --> 58:06.961
- I wanna go home!
- You are home. You are home.

58:07.017 --> 58:09.019
I wanna go home!

58:09.086 --> 58:11.623
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Rip.

58:11.688 --> 58:13.167
It's okay.

58:13.223 --> 58:14.861
- That's enough. That's enough.
- It's okay.

58:14.925 --> 58:17.303
Come here, sweetie.

58:17.361 --> 58:20.069
That's enough for one night.
That's enough.

58:59.670 --> 59:04.050
The first night we moved,
I sat right here.

59:04.107 --> 59:05.848
Right here with Joey.

59:07.044 --> 59:10.423
I remember I asked him- I said, "Son...

59:10.480 --> 59:12.482
How deep do you think the ocean is?"

59:14.084 --> 59:17.190
He said, "Daddy, I bet you
it's 50feet deep. "

59:32.836 --> 59:35.043
We used to be on the same team.

59:37.607 --> 59:40.019
I don't feeI like we are anymore.

59:46.616 --> 59:48.562
You know, honey, you were right.

59:51.755 --> 59:55.202
I was disappointed when we-
when we adopted Joey.

59:57.527 --> 01:00:01.873
I wanted my own son.
I wanted my own blood.

01:00:08.405 --> 01:00:10.612
But from the moment that he came home...

01:00:10.674 --> 01:00:12.881
I loved him like he was mine.

01:00:19.549 --> 01:00:22.689
But he's not mine.

01:00:22.753 --> 01:00:26.223
They can just take him-

01:00:29.693 --> 01:00:32.037
They could just take him away.

01:01:19.709 --> 01:01:21.450
Hey, little man.

01:01:37.394 --> 01:01:39.533
Hey, Joey.

01:01:39.596 --> 01:01:41.542
Do you know about dandelions-

01:01:41.598 --> 01:01:43.669
how you can make wishes on 'em?

01:01:48.572 --> 01:01:52.679
You just close your eyes, make a wish...

01:01:52.742 --> 01:01:55.848
And then... you blow.

01:01:58.281 --> 01:02:00.352
Why blow on it?

01:02:00.417 --> 01:02:04.593
Because there's a wish inside here.

01:02:05.388 --> 01:02:08.096
And when you blow on it...

01:02:08.158 --> 01:02:10.832
That wish gets set free.

01:02:12.462 --> 01:02:14.203
And then it can come true.

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:18.880
You wanna try it?

01:02:25.942 --> 01:02:28.320
Wishes are important, Joey.

01:02:28.378 --> 01:02:32.952
You always have to believe that things
can get better than they are now.

01:03:18.061 --> 01:03:19.904
Hey.

01:03:21.898 --> 01:03:25.311
- What's wrong?
- Hey. What happened?

01:03:25.368 --> 01:03:28.247
Well, I think things were
a little more difficult this time.

01:03:28.305 --> 01:03:30.285
- Difficult how, Ms. Bower?
- I don't know.

01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:32.718
He wouldn't tell me.
Maybe he'll tell you.

01:03:32.776 --> 01:03:36.781
Oh. Mrs. Porter offered to give you
an extra week to say your good-byes.

01:03:36.846 --> 01:03:40.089
- And the judge agreed.
- Okay. Thank you.

01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:41.652
Bye, Joey.

01:03:43.186 --> 01:03:45.097
- Hey.
- What happened?

01:03:45.155 --> 01:03:47.829
Hey, hey. What's the matter?

01:03:49.359 --> 01:03:52.602
What happened? Joey?

01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:55.006
- Hey, hey. Hey.
- Sweetie?

01:03:55.999 --> 01:03:57.501
Joey?

01:04:01.371 --> 01:04:02.873
Joey?

01:04:03.873 --> 01:04:05.511
Joey, what happened?

01:04:05.575 --> 01:04:07.577
Joey, come on.
Sit up and talk to me.

01:04:08.545 --> 01:04:10.821
- Come here, sweetie.
- What's going on?

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:13.656
- Talk to me. What happened?
- He hurt me.

01:04:13.717 --> 01:04:16.425
He made me take a shower
in my clothes.

01:04:16.486 --> 01:04:18.796
- He what?
- Where, sweetie? Where did he hurt you?

01:04:22.225 --> 01:04:23.932
Rip did this to you?

01:04:23.994 --> 01:04:26.235
He said you're not
my real mommy and daddy.

01:04:26.296 --> 01:04:29.175
- Is that true?
- No.

01:04:29.232 --> 01:04:31.234
No, sweetheart, that's not true.

01:04:32.435 --> 01:04:34.574
That's not true.

01:04:34.638 --> 01:04:37.744
An extra week?
Why would you agree to this?

01:04:37.807 --> 01:04:40.720
- I didn't agree to it.
- What?

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:45.856
- It was my idea.
- It was your- What?

01:04:48.685 --> 01:04:49.993
Why?

01:04:50.053 --> 01:04:52.761
'Cause you're not ready.
You need more time.

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:56.200
Oh, so you just-
That's your decision, is it?

01:04:56.259 --> 01:04:59.706
You just go behind my back
and keep me from my son?

01:04:59.763 --> 01:05:01.765
You hurt him, Rip.

01:05:01.831 --> 01:05:03.572
I didn't mean to hurt him. I was trying-

01:05:03.633 --> 01:05:06.375
But you did hurt him,
and you terrified him.

01:05:06.436 --> 01:05:09.246
I知 just trying to protect him-
and you.

01:05:09.305 --> 01:05:11.376
Right. How can you say that?

01:05:11.441 --> 01:05:15.514
How can you say that when you lie
and you hide these things from me?

01:05:15.578 --> 01:05:17.114
I知 not lying. I told you.

01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:19.888
I知 telling you.
I'm not hiding anything.

01:05:19.949 --> 01:05:21.223
Where you goin'?

01:05:21.284 --> 01:05:24.265
I知 gonna go wash my face,
and I'm gonna go to bed.

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:28.462
No! I need to talk to you about this.
You should've told me.

01:05:28.525 --> 01:05:30.505
I think you'd better sleep on the couch.

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:32.062
No.

01:05:32.128 --> 01:05:33.539
No! Listen.

01:05:33.596 --> 01:05:35.906
- Call her back and tell her
you made a mistake. - No.

01:05:35.965 --> 01:05:38.377
- Baby, listen to me. Just call her.
- No.

01:05:38.435 --> 01:05:41.211
No! I said no! It wasn't a mistake!

01:05:41.271 --> 01:05:42.875
Call her!

01:06:03.427 --> 01:06:06.169
Get the camera.
I want a shot of that bruise right now.

01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:08.904
- Who are you calling?
- Allyson Bower.

01:06:08.966 --> 01:06:12.243
Call Dr. Riley and tell him that I'll be
in there in 15 minutes with Joey.

01:06:12.302 --> 01:06:15.681
All of this is gonna accomplish what? What-
you're gonna file a lawsuit, send Porter to jail?

01:06:15.739 --> 01:06:18.811
- I'm gonna send him to prison. - You said it yourself.
That's not gonna do us any good.

01:06:18.875 --> 01:06:21.617
We could put Porter away for the rest
of his life. Joey still won't be ours.

01:06:21.678 --> 01:06:23.248
- This is Jack Campbell for Allyson Bower.
- Jack.

01:06:23.313 --> 01:06:25.315
What then? What?

01:06:26.516 --> 01:06:28.621
We have to leave.

01:06:31.054 --> 01:06:33.056
We have to pack our things and go.

01:06:44.368 --> 01:06:45.540
Look.

01:06:46.970 --> 01:06:49.576
We've both been thinking it.
We just haven't wanted to say it.

01:06:53.944 --> 01:06:55.946
We can't win, Jack.

01:07:02.986 --> 01:07:04.727
You want to run away?

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:12.736
Listen to me.

01:07:12.796 --> 01:07:15.834
No one is coming to save us.

01:07:21.071 --> 01:07:22.209
Go where?

01:07:24.441 --> 01:07:27.479
Out of the country.
Anywhere.

01:07:28.845 --> 01:07:31.689
You realize what you're saying,
don't you?

01:07:33.116 --> 01:07:34.618
I do.

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:38.266
All of this would be gone.

01:07:40.057 --> 01:07:43.231
We'd never be able to come back.

01:07:43.293 --> 01:07:45.295
All our friends...

01:07:46.697 --> 01:07:48.370
Your sister-

01:07:48.432 --> 01:07:50.810
We'd never be able to contact them again.

01:07:55.505 --> 01:07:58.008
We'd have Joey.

01:08:06.216 --> 01:08:07.718
Yeah.

01:08:13.557 --> 01:08:16.560
- Hey. Everything okay?
- Yeah, yeah. Of course.

01:08:16.626 --> 01:08:18.435
- How are you?
- Good. You want some tea?

01:08:18.495 --> 01:08:19.769
Sure.

01:08:19.830 --> 01:08:21.571
So what's going on?

01:08:21.631 --> 01:08:24.703
How come you couldn't
tell me on the phone?

01:08:24.768 --> 01:08:27.009
Curt Golding talked
to the congressman from Ohio...

01:08:27.069 --> 01:08:30.916
And he's asked D.C.S. for an investigation
by the state commission.

01:08:30.974 --> 01:08:32.419
What does that mean?

01:08:32.475 --> 01:08:34.080
It means the transfer's suspended...

01:08:34.144 --> 01:08:38.819
And the commission can reverse
the judge's decision- permanently.

01:08:38.881 --> 01:08:42.193
That's great! Oh, sweetheart!

01:08:42.252 --> 01:08:43.993
See? I knew something would give.

01:08:44.054 --> 01:08:45.624
I knew something would give.

01:08:45.689 --> 01:08:49.831
Um, listen, Jack and I were talking...

01:08:49.893 --> 01:08:53.500
And we think we want
to go to Haiti with you.

01:08:53.563 --> 01:08:55.064
Really?

01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:56.941
Yeah. I mean, with everything
that's gone on...

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.073
I think it would be great for alI of us to
get away, be together as a family.

01:09:01.138 --> 01:09:03.640
So, what do you think?

01:09:03.707 --> 01:09:05.778
And it's okay to take him
out of the country?

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:08.185
- You're allowed?
- Of course it is.

01:09:08.245 --> 01:09:11.124
The order's suspended.
We can do what we want.

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:15.459
Besides, I think it'd be fun,
you know, for the kids, for us.

01:09:15.519 --> 01:09:19.466
Do you think you can
arrange it with the church?

01:09:19.523 --> 01:09:22.697
It's a little last-minute,
but-but absolutely.

01:09:22.759 --> 01:09:25.603
- We'll work it out.
- Okay.

01:09:32.736 --> 01:09:34.578
- Good to see you.
- Hi. Good.

01:09:34.638 --> 01:09:36.140
We'll see you inside.

01:09:37.841 --> 01:09:39.787
Hey. Hi there, Molly.

01:09:39.843 --> 01:09:41.720
It's Joey. You see him?

01:09:41.778 --> 01:09:43.553
Joey!

01:09:43.613 --> 01:09:45.991
Wow. Hey, Jack.

01:09:46.049 --> 01:09:47.687
Hey.

01:09:47.751 --> 01:09:49.787
- It's good to see you, sir.
- Nice to be back.

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:54.167
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

01:09:56.293 --> 01:10:00.332
# The Lord bless you #

01:10:00.397 --> 01:10:04.777
# And keep you #

01:10:04.835 --> 01:10:11.684
# The Lord lift his countenance
upon you #

01:10:11.741 --> 01:10:18.854
# And give you peace #

01:10:18.915 --> 01:10:23.261
# The Lord make his face #

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:27.530
# To shine upon you #

01:10:29.993 --> 01:10:34.533
# the Lord be gracious #

01:10:34.598 --> 01:10:41.106
# Gracious unto you #

01:10:41.171 --> 01:10:49.247
# Amen #

01:10:49.312 --> 01:11:05.073
# Amen#

01:11:05.128 --> 01:11:22.912
# Amen #

01:11:30.487 --> 01:11:32.626
Who is it?

01:11:32.689 --> 01:11:36.068
It's Allyson Bower, Mrs. Porter.

01:11:36.126 --> 01:11:39.039
I know it's late,
but I need to speak with you.

01:11:40.297 --> 01:11:43.278
I知 sorry.
I can't come to the door right now.

01:11:44.834 --> 01:11:48.008
Mrs. Porter,
you haven't returned my calls.

01:11:48.071 --> 01:11:50.677
I need to speak with you
just for a moment.

01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:52.686
Please, open the door.

01:11:59.082 --> 01:12:00.254
Mrs. Porter?

01:12:19.336 --> 01:12:22.442
Something's going on
with Jack and Molly.

01:12:22.505 --> 01:12:24.451
What do you mean?

01:12:25.875 --> 01:12:29.015
She says the congressman
is helping her.

01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:32.457
But I know her.

01:12:32.515 --> 01:12:36.292
And the way she's acting,
there's just something that's not right.

01:12:36.353 --> 01:12:39.232
- How should she be acting?
- Think about it.

01:12:39.289 --> 01:12:41.132
Suddenly she's going to church with us...

01:12:41.191 --> 01:12:44.001
And now they want
to leave the country and go to Haiti.

01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:46.506
Don't you think it's strange?

01:12:46.563 --> 01:12:49.703
No, I don't think it's strange.
We invited them, remember?

01:12:49.766 --> 01:12:52.906
You know what I mean.

01:12:58.375 --> 01:13:00.377
Honey, you need to be careful.

01:13:04.748 --> 01:13:07.024
I appreciate you taking my call.

01:13:07.083 --> 01:13:10.895
I just wanted to thank you personally.

01:13:10.954 --> 01:13:12.695
Excuse me?

01:13:12.756 --> 01:13:15.794
I just wanted to thank you
for what you're doing-

01:13:15.859 --> 01:13:17.600
for Joey, for their son.

01:13:17.661 --> 01:13:21.234
Ms. Norton, I told Jack weeks ago
there was nothing I could do...

01:13:21.297 --> 01:13:23.243
And there is still nothing I can do.

01:13:23.299 --> 01:13:25.074
I'm very sorry for his situation...

01:13:25.135 --> 01:13:27.342
But I really don't appreciate
this phone call.

01:13:27.404 --> 01:13:31.250
- I'm- I'm sorry, Congressman.
I must have misunderstood. -It's alright

01:13:31.307 --> 01:13:34.220
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to-
- That's fine.

01:13:34.277 --> 01:13:36.223
- Have a good day
- Thank you.

01:13:47.190 --> 01:13:49.227
Are you my real dad?

01:13:57.667 --> 01:13:59.010
Well.

01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:02.579
Let me ask you.

01:14:02.639 --> 01:14:04.880
What do you think?

01:14:04.941 --> 01:14:07.683
I think you are.

01:14:07.744 --> 01:14:08.916
Why?

01:14:08.978 --> 01:14:10.855
You take care of me...

01:14:10.914 --> 01:14:13.087
And you taught me
how to play baseball.

01:14:13.149 --> 01:14:15.151
And I changed your diapers too.
That was gross.

01:14:19.923 --> 01:14:23.234
What else?
What else do I do, son?

01:14:23.293 --> 01:14:25.239
You love me.

01:14:25.295 --> 01:14:27.297
Yeah.

01:14:27.363 --> 01:14:30.674
And that's the most important thing
a father can do.

01:14:30.734 --> 01:14:33.112
So why did Rip say he was my dad?

01:14:37.373 --> 01:14:40.354
Listen to me for a second, Joe, okay?
This might be a little confusing.

01:14:40.410 --> 01:14:43.653
But I'm gonna try to explain
something to you, all right?

01:14:43.713 --> 01:14:48.059
Wendy is the woman
that gave birth to you, okay?

01:14:48.118 --> 01:14:50.462
And then your mother and I met you...

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:54.662
And we loved you so much
that we became your real parents-forever.

01:14:54.724 --> 01:14:56.203
Just like Robbie Elwood?

01:14:56.259 --> 01:14:59.206
That's right. That's right.
We adopted you, son.

01:14:59.262 --> 01:15:01.640
So I'm gonna stay here
with you and Mom?

01:15:01.698 --> 01:15:03.974
Is that what you want?

01:15:04.033 --> 01:15:05.535
It is?

01:15:07.036 --> 01:15:09.482
Okay.

01:15:11.541 --> 01:15:15.455
Then we'll be together,
no matter what. All right?

01:15:17.046 --> 01:15:18.992
No matter what.

01:15:24.721 --> 01:15:26.462
- That's it.
- Thanks, babe.

01:15:43.139 --> 01:15:44.880
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:15:44.941 --> 01:15:47.547
Flight 56 is now ready for boarding.

01:15:47.610 --> 01:15:49.954
We'd like to be in first-class
and gold card members...

01:15:50.013 --> 01:15:52.653
to board Flight 56, thank you.

01:16:05.328 --> 01:16:06.671
Okay.

01:16:06.729 --> 01:16:08.402
- Put your seat belt on? That's good.
- Yeah.

01:16:14.037 --> 01:16:16.950
Turn around and buckle up.

01:16:23.313 --> 01:16:25.793
Ladies and gentlemen,
the boarding door has been closed

01:16:25.849 --> 01:16:29.888
Once again, this is Flight 257
with nonstop service to Port-au-Prince.

01:16:29.953 --> 01:16:32.593
Before the aircraft moves,
all passengers must be seated..

01:16:32.655 --> 01:16:36.398
With your seat belts securely fastened
tray stations stowed and baggage secured

01:16:36.459 --> 01:16:38.234
Enjoy your fight

01:17:28.378 --> 01:17:30.984
Hey, friend, come with me.
Let me show you your quarters.

01:18:27.103 --> 01:18:28.980
You get any of that on the fence?

01:18:29.038 --> 01:18:30.574
Hey, easy now.

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:34.520
We were working hard manual labor
while you boys were in town shopping.

01:18:34.577 --> 01:18:38.423
- Believe me, you were better off here.
- Bill, you mind taking over?

01:18:38.481 --> 01:18:41.223
- Oh, yeah, with pleasure. Can I do that?
- Oh, gladly.

01:18:41.284 --> 01:18:43.423
I値l go get cleaned up.

01:18:44.787 --> 01:18:46.323
Hey.

01:18:46.389 --> 01:18:50.394
So, I found a taxi driver
to pick us up tomorrow at 2:00 p. m.

01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:52.201
And our flight's at 4:30.

01:18:54.030 --> 01:18:56.237
Okay. Do you think he'll show?

01:18:56.299 --> 01:18:58.301
Yeah. I gave him
a hundred dollars today...

01:18:58.368 --> 01:19:01.542
And I said I'd give him $200 tomorrow
when he gets us to the airport.

01:19:01.604 --> 01:19:04.483
Trust me. That's a lot of money
for a guy like that. He'll show.

01:19:38.174 --> 01:19:40.176
You're home early.

01:19:40.877 --> 01:19:42.379
Yeah.

01:19:43.646 --> 01:19:45.387
They sent me home.

01:19:46.449 --> 01:19:48.554
I can't concentrate, and I-

01:19:49.952 --> 01:19:51.954
I can't eat and I can't sleep.

01:19:52.021 --> 01:19:55.833
And I don't understand why you-
you haven't called the police.

01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:59.262
No police.

01:20:04.233 --> 01:20:06.179
So you're leaving me then.

01:20:08.638 --> 01:20:10.140
No.

01:20:11.574 --> 01:20:13.315
I don't think so.

01:20:18.047 --> 01:20:19.390
Rip.

01:20:22.752 --> 01:20:27.292
We've both made
big mistakes in our lives.

01:20:31.494 --> 01:20:33.599
But I know your heart.

01:20:35.565 --> 01:20:37.567
I know, inside, you're good...

01:20:38.734 --> 01:20:40.680
Even if you don't.

01:21:03.259 --> 01:21:04.761
I知 sorry.

01:21:06.929 --> 01:21:08.670
I知 so sorry.

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:12.970
Sorry.

01:21:13.870 --> 01:21:15.816
I know.

01:21:20.143 --> 01:21:22.851
Now, if we're going to try...

01:21:25.348 --> 01:21:27.294
There's one thing I-I need.

01:21:35.958 --> 01:21:38.438
You remember?

01:21:38.494 --> 01:21:40.235
Father Logan.

01:21:47.203 --> 01:21:49.149
We'll do it together, babe.

01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:52.281
Me and you.

01:22:23.439 --> 01:22:25.419
Tackle him.

01:22:26.375 --> 01:22:28.480
Okay.

01:22:28.544 --> 01:22:31.889
Oh, my gosh!

01:22:34.917 --> 01:22:36.260
Oh!

01:22:36.319 --> 01:22:38.390
I'm exhausted.

01:22:38.454 --> 01:22:40.161
Nice job, man.

01:22:40.223 --> 01:22:42.669
Nice, man.
That's what I like to see.

01:22:42.725 --> 01:22:46.332
I値l meet you guys at the bus at noon, and then
we'll head into town with everybody else?

01:22:46.395 --> 01:22:49.638
Actually, we were thinking about hanging as
a family and letting you guys do your thing.

01:22:49.699 --> 01:22:51.906
We'll come back and have dinner
with you later, if you don't mind.

01:22:51.968 --> 01:22:53.641
- It's good by me. Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:22:53.703 --> 01:22:56.183
- It's good.
- Okay. You sure?

01:22:56.239 --> 01:22:58.310
Yeah. Is that okay?

01:22:58.374 --> 01:23:00.445
Yeah, of course.
Whatever you want.

01:23:00.509 --> 01:23:02.682
Okay.

01:23:02.745 --> 01:23:04.486
See you at dinner. I love you.

01:23:06.215 --> 01:23:08.491
Okay.

01:23:08.551 --> 01:23:11.430
- I love you.
- I love you too.

01:23:11.487 --> 01:23:13.160
Okay.

01:23:13.222 --> 01:23:14.997
- See you later?
- Yeah, man. Have fun. Joey.

01:23:15.057 --> 01:23:17.128
You guys have a good day.

01:23:19.095 --> 01:23:20.369
- Bye.
- Bye, Joey.

01:23:20.429 --> 01:23:22.807
- He's a ballplayer, huh?
- Yeah, he is.

01:23:22.865 --> 01:23:24.606
- See you tonight.
- All right, Jack.

01:23:24.667 --> 01:23:27.307
Are you hot? Your cheeks are all pink.

01:23:27.370 --> 01:23:30.010
- Come on, buddy.
- See you guys.

01:23:30.072 --> 01:23:31.574
Poor thing.

01:24:07.610 --> 01:24:09.146
Are you okay?

01:24:11.414 --> 01:24:12.654
Come here.

01:24:23.993 --> 01:24:26.166
Molly lied.

01:24:27.396 --> 01:24:29.569
Curt Golding isn't helping them.

01:24:32.735 --> 01:24:35.045
They used us, Bill.

01:24:35.104 --> 01:24:37.345
They used the church, this trip.

01:24:39.642 --> 01:24:42.919
They're taking Joey,
and they're running away.

01:24:42.978 --> 01:24:45.049
I know.

01:24:47.616 --> 01:24:49.789
What? What do you mean you know?

01:24:49.852 --> 01:24:52.594
It's what I would have done.

01:24:55.791 --> 01:24:59.967
No, Bill. No, it's wrong,
and you know it's wrong.

01:25:00.029 --> 01:25:03.203
- If God wanted them to have Joey-
- Beth, stop it! Stop it!

01:25:03.265 --> 01:25:07.372
You don't get to decide
what God's will is.

01:25:07.436 --> 01:25:10.508
Do you want Joey to be beaten,
maybe killed by this man?

01:25:10.573 --> 01:25:11.881
No.

01:25:11.941 --> 01:25:13.716
The courts are wrong, Beth.

01:25:13.776 --> 01:25:15.983
What other option
do they have at this point?

01:25:19.048 --> 01:25:21.585
Honey, what else is this trip for
if not to save children?

01:25:22.685 --> 01:25:24.130
Right?

01:25:24.186 --> 01:25:26.427
I know you're gonna miss your sister.

01:25:26.489 --> 01:25:30.301
But this isn't your choice.
We have to let them go.

01:25:32.695 --> 01:25:35.471
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.674
No, it's not.

01:25:40.736 --> 01:25:42.238
Why?

01:25:48.878 --> 01:25:52.018
I called Allyson Bower.

01:25:52.081 --> 01:25:53.526
Oh, Beth.

01:26:00.589 --> 01:26:04.366
All right, here we go.
Line up. Line up.

01:26:04.427 --> 01:26:06.998
Defense, you're getting burned.

01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:19.144
- Jack.
- What?

01:26:19.208 --> 01:26:21.154
You need to get your family
out of here right now.

01:26:21.210 --> 01:26:23.622
- What? What are you talking about?
- Now.

01:26:23.679 --> 01:26:25.886
- Bill, what's going on?
- I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

01:26:25.948 --> 01:26:28.189
- What?
- Dad, is everything okay?

01:26:28.250 --> 01:26:30.696
Let's go. Let's go.

01:26:30.753 --> 01:26:32.664
Let's go. Let's go.
Walk, walk, walk.

01:26:32.721 --> 01:26:35.031
Give me the keys.
Give me the keys to the jeep.

01:26:35.090 --> 01:26:38.094
Jack. Jack. Here you go.
Take the jeep.

01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:40.470
Where to? Where to?

01:26:41.931 --> 01:26:43.740
I got you covered. Go, go, go.

01:26:43.799 --> 01:26:46.302
- What did you do?
- I don't know.

01:26:46.368 --> 01:26:47.813
What did you do?

01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:49.872
Sit on your mom's lap.

01:26:51.106 --> 01:26:52.847
Come here, baby. Come here.

01:26:52.908 --> 01:26:55.479
Just relax, sweetheart. Just relax.

01:26:58.581 --> 01:27:00.959
Mommy, where are we going?

01:27:18.767 --> 01:27:20.405
It's okay, baby. Just breathe.

01:27:26.942 --> 01:27:29.752
At the gate,
we'll just go nice and easy, all right?

01:27:40.422 --> 01:27:42.561
- How are you, sir?
- How you doing, man?

01:27:42.625 --> 01:27:44.832
- Where you going?
- We're just going shopping.

01:27:44.894 --> 01:27:46.396
That's okay. That's okay.

01:27:59.241 --> 01:28:02.313
- Everything's okay?
- Perfect.

01:28:02.378 --> 01:28:03.755
Good.

01:28:10.553 --> 01:28:13.261
Thanks a lot.

01:28:16.725 --> 01:28:19.069
Okay! Stop! Get out of your car!

01:28:19.128 --> 01:28:21.267
- Easy, man.
- Mommy?

01:28:21.330 --> 01:28:23.003
Right now.

01:28:23.065 --> 01:28:25.272
Jack.

01:29:39.541 --> 01:29:43.182
Mr. and Mrs. Campbell.

01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:46.520
Where is our son?

01:29:46.582 --> 01:29:48.721
I知 sorry that you had
to be brought back this way...

01:29:48.784 --> 01:29:51.287
But I had to stop you
from making a very big mistake.

01:29:51.353 --> 01:29:53.697
- Is Joey all right?
- He's fine.

01:29:53.756 --> 01:29:55.827
- He's just down the hall.
- Ms. Bower, we've done nothing wrong.

01:29:55.891 --> 01:29:59.031
Mr. Campbell, please, have a seat.

01:30:05.501 --> 01:30:09.415
Now, you did do something wrong.
We both know that.

01:30:09.471 --> 01:30:12.850
And I've spent a lot of hours
trying to keep you out of jail.

01:30:12.908 --> 01:30:14.512
I壇 like to talk to my lawyer.

01:30:14.576 --> 01:30:18.183
Mr. Campbell, I am on your side.

01:30:18.247 --> 01:30:20.090
I am.

01:30:20.149 --> 01:30:23.358
Now, it's been a really
long night for all of us.

01:30:26.188 --> 01:30:29.863
I have Mrs. Porter with me.
She's right outside.

01:30:29.925 --> 01:30:32.405
She wants to talk to you...

01:30:32.461 --> 01:30:34.407
So I'm gonna bring her in.

01:30:49.378 --> 01:30:50.550
Hello.

01:30:54.817 --> 01:30:56.558
I知 Wendy Porter.

01:31:00.322 --> 01:31:03.132
I know you tried to run away with Joey.

01:31:04.827 --> 01:31:06.568
Ms. Porter...

01:31:08.263 --> 01:31:10.869
He had bruises on his body.

01:31:12.968 --> 01:31:15.505
I was just trying to protect my son.

01:31:18.674 --> 01:31:21.678
I have to telI you, when you...

01:31:21.744 --> 01:31:25.214
Offered my husband money for Joey...

01:31:27.082 --> 01:31:29.926
You nearly crushed the man.

01:31:29.985 --> 01:31:33.797
Would that be what you
would teach our son? That-

01:31:33.856 --> 01:31:36.200
That poor people can just be bought off?

01:31:36.258 --> 01:31:37.259
No.

01:31:37.326 --> 01:31:41.672
I thought he wanted money.

01:31:41.730 --> 01:31:44.301
And I- I was wrong.

01:31:46.502 --> 01:31:48.948
And I know that now.

01:31:49.004 --> 01:31:53.043
You have no idea how much
that boy means to him.

01:31:55.744 --> 01:31:58.281
I made a terrible mistake seven years ago.

01:31:58.347 --> 01:32:01.191
I never should have given up my baby.

01:32:02.618 --> 01:32:06.566
But with everything that's happened...

01:32:06.622 --> 01:32:09.865
I need to be sure now that
I'm doing the right thing for him.

01:32:20.569 --> 01:32:22.810
Mrs. Porter.

01:32:22.871 --> 01:32:24.544
Wendy.

01:32:26.742 --> 01:32:30.588
Joey is our whole world.

01:32:30.646 --> 01:32:32.557
He's our boy.

01:32:32.614 --> 01:32:37.154
I love him as if
I gave birth to him myself.

01:32:39.254 --> 01:32:43.100
And I can't imagine
spending a day without him.

01:32:48.130 --> 01:32:50.076
But from the moment
we brought him home...

01:32:50.132 --> 01:32:54.342
My biggest fear was that
he would wake up one morning...

01:32:54.403 --> 01:32:57.577
And realize that
I'm not really his mother...

01:32:57.639 --> 01:33:00.176
That I'm...

01:33:00.242 --> 01:33:04.588
Just some woman who's raising him.

01:33:08.217 --> 01:33:10.720
But he never did.

01:33:20.596 --> 01:33:22.542
And he never will.

01:33:23.899 --> 01:33:25.242
Ms. Bower.

01:33:26.268 --> 01:33:30.648
I have the revised adoption papers here.

01:33:30.706 --> 01:33:32.913
Mr. Porter has already signed...

01:33:32.975 --> 01:33:35.888
And I personally
witnessed his signature.

01:34:12.514 --> 01:34:15.290
Thank you.

01:34:16.418 --> 01:34:17.920
Thank you so much.

01:34:19.288 --> 01:34:21.427
I want you both to know that, uh...

01:34:21.490 --> 01:34:24.937
Rip really does love Joey.

01:34:24.993 --> 01:34:28.839
He just wasn't ready to be a father,
and he knows that.

01:34:31.833 --> 01:34:33.744
Ms. Porter...

01:34:35.837 --> 01:34:38.147
Will you tell your husband
that I apologize?

01:34:44.913 --> 01:34:46.790
Is there anything that we can do for you?

01:34:46.848 --> 01:34:48.452
And it doesn't have to be money.

01:34:48.517 --> 01:34:51.088
I mean, I-

01:34:51.153 --> 01:34:53.861
We'll be all right.
We're getting help. Thanks.

01:34:56.058 --> 01:34:59.505
There is one thing that-
that you could do for me.

01:35:01.630 --> 01:35:06.943
I would like Joey to know
that he- he has two mothers-

01:35:07.002 --> 01:35:10.677
one that loved him so much
that she couldn't let him go...

01:35:10.739 --> 01:35:13.413
And one that loved him so much
that she had to.

01:35:23.852 --> 01:35:26.162
You have my word.

01:35:29.191 --> 01:35:30.363
Thank you.

01:35:36.298 --> 01:35:39.677
May I- May I say good-bye to him?

01:35:42.237 --> 01:35:44.217
Of course.

01:35:54.416 --> 01:35:57.124
Joey, it was real nice...

01:35:57.185 --> 01:35:59.756
Having you come
and spend time with us at our house.

01:35:59.821 --> 01:36:03.064
Getting to know you...

01:36:03.125 --> 01:36:06.902
And see what a bright
and beautiful boy you've become...

01:36:08.563 --> 01:36:10.543
Laughing with you and

01:36:10.599 --> 01:36:15.207
have honestly been some
of the happiest moments of my life.

01:36:15.270 --> 01:36:17.079
What happened to your face?

01:36:17.139 --> 01:36:20.086
Oh, I got hurt, but I'm gonna be okay.

01:36:21.443 --> 01:36:23.320
Am I gonna come see you again?

01:36:23.378 --> 01:36:26.222
No. No, sweetheart.
That was our last visit.

01:36:26.281 --> 01:36:28.283
You're not coming back anymore.

01:36:28.350 --> 01:36:29.556
Why not?

01:36:31.887 --> 01:36:34.458
Remember I told you
about the dandelion...

01:36:34.523 --> 01:36:36.764
And how we had to set the wish free?

01:36:38.460 --> 01:36:41.100
Sometimes people are like that too, baby.

01:36:43.732 --> 01:36:46.110
Now...

01:36:46.168 --> 01:36:49.513
I want you to remember me...

01:36:49.571 --> 01:36:52.017
And try and remember...

01:36:52.074 --> 01:36:55.283
Only the happy times, okay?

01:36:57.412 --> 01:37:02.418
This here... is very special.

01:37:02.484 --> 01:37:05.465
Rip gave it to me
when I was a girl, and...

01:37:07.189 --> 01:37:09.499
I want you to have it.

01:37:09.558 --> 01:37:11.902
Inside is a picture of me and Rip...

01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:15.339
And our address in case you
should ever need anything...

01:37:15.397 --> 01:37:17.968
Anything at all.

01:37:18.033 --> 01:37:21.674
Maybe one day when
you're a big, strong man...

01:37:21.736 --> 01:37:23.477
We'll meet again.

01:37:29.945 --> 01:37:31.686
I love you.

01:37:40.922 --> 01:37:42.668
This is the final boarding call-

01:37:42.724 --> 01:37:44.226
Mommy! Daddy!

01:37:44.293 --> 01:37:46.637
- Hey.
- Hey!

01:37:46.695 --> 01:37:49.107
Oh! Oh, we missed you.

01:37:49.164 --> 01:37:51.337
- Me too.
- Yeah, you okay?

01:37:52.567 --> 01:37:53.944
- You sure?
- Yeah.

01:37:54.002 --> 01:37:55.504
Okay, good.

01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:00.217
So what have you been doing?

01:38:24.199 --> 01:38:25.837
- Yep.
- Amazing.

01:38:25.901 --> 01:38:27.574
Ha, ha!

01:38:27.636 --> 01:38:29.877
Come here, Son. You ready?

01:38:31.940 --> 01:38:34.352
Now, hold on tight, okay? All right.

01:38:35.811 --> 01:38:37.654
- Can you steer it?
- Yeah.

01:38:37.713 --> 01:38:39.283
Feels great.

01:38:40.048 --> 01:38:42.085
You stay right there.

01:38:43.719 --> 01:38:45.665
- Is it fun?
- Yeah!

01:38:45.721 --> 01:38:47.291
Good job.

01:38:47.356 --> 01:38:48.664
Wow!

01:38:50.993 --> 01:38:52.939
You're all right.
Just hold it right there.

01:38:54.029 --> 01:38:55.531
We're gonna crash.

01:38:55.597 --> 01:38:57.770
There's no boats in front of you.
I'm watching out for you.
