WEBVTT

00:11.344 --> 00:13.096
[Jen] You wanna tell us
where you went last night?

00:13.179 --> 00:15.181
-You're not in trouble.
-You're in so much fucking trouble.

00:15.306 --> 00:17.100
I just drove without a license. Who cares?

00:17.183 --> 00:18.560
[Jen] The law. That's who cares.

00:18.643 --> 00:21.146
Do you know what the punishment is
for driving without a license?

00:21.646 --> 00:22.480
What?

00:22.564 --> 00:24.065
-You go to fucking jail.
-A ticket, then--

00:24.149 --> 00:25.316
-Seriously?
-[Jen] Mm-hmm.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.152
You could get your mom
in a lot of trouble, too.

00:27.235 --> 00:28.486
Yeah. So...

00:29.112 --> 00:32.282
Do you want to tell me where you went
on your little joyride?

00:32.490 --> 00:34.159
[stuttering] We didn't really go anywhere.

00:34.242 --> 00:37.120
I picked up Parker around four, then
we drove out to where you found us.

00:37.203 --> 00:38.872
We-- we barely got out of the car.

00:38.955 --> 00:40.957
-Oh, really? You barely got out?
-Mm-hmm.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.960
What were you doing sitting
in a car for five hours?

00:47.213 --> 00:49.090
-Oh, God.
-Okay.

00:49.215 --> 00:50.050
-Oh.
-Give me your phone.

00:50.425 --> 00:51.718
-What?
-[Jen] You heard me.

00:51.801 --> 00:54.179
And go get your laptop
and all your video game shit

00:54.262 --> 00:55.221
and a power drill.

00:55.930 --> 00:56.848
Why?

00:56.931 --> 00:58.558
Because you just lost your bedroom door.

00:58.767 --> 00:59.684
That-- [laughs]

00:59.768 --> 01:01.227
-That's fucking crazy.
-[Jen] You know what?

01:01.311 --> 01:04.272
Until you can prove to me
that you can make good decisions

01:04.355 --> 01:06.357
and that you care about anybody
but yourself,

01:06.441 --> 01:07.692
you are gonna go where I go,

01:07.776 --> 01:09.152
you are gonna do what I do.

01:09.235 --> 01:11.905
No privileges and no fucking fun.

01:11.988 --> 01:13.448
Judy, will you tell her
she's being insane?

01:13.990 --> 01:15.241
I think Jen is your mother,

01:15.325 --> 01:18.036
and you should listen to her
and trust that she knows what she's doing.

01:18.119 --> 01:19.704
-Thank you, Judy.
-You're welcome.

01:19.788 --> 01:22.749
You sure you know what you're doing?
I feel like you're being a little harsh.

01:22.832 --> 01:24.876
Do you really think burning the car
was the best idea?

01:25.210 --> 01:27.629
Charlie's fingerprints were all over it.
What choice did I have?

01:27.712 --> 01:29.881
Don't you think it's like
sending a smoke signal?

01:29.964 --> 01:32.759
Oh, my God. If I have to explain it,
then you're not gonna fucking get it.

01:32.842 --> 01:33.927
-[Henry] Mommy.
-[Jen] Hi.

01:35.386 --> 01:36.471
My stomach hurts.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.224
I don't think I can go
to Holy Harmonies practice.

01:39.307 --> 01:41.559
-[Judy] Aww.
-But, babe, it's your first solo tonight.

01:41.643 --> 01:43.770
Oh, maybe he's a little nervous?

01:44.979 --> 01:48.316
Okay, look. Hen, we all have stuff
that we don't want to do,

01:48.399 --> 01:50.026
but sometimes in life there are have-to's,

01:50.110 --> 01:52.654
and you made a commitment,
so this is a have-to.

01:53.196 --> 01:54.364
Here, for your tummy.

01:55.532 --> 01:56.407
Thanks.

01:56.491 --> 01:57.659
Is that a new necklace?

01:57.742 --> 01:58.743
It's pretty.

01:58.827 --> 02:02.372
Yeah. My new friend gave me the stone,
and then I made the necklace.

02:02.455 --> 02:03.289
[Henry] Cool.

02:04.374 --> 02:05.667
New friend? What new friend?

02:05.750 --> 02:07.252
Michelle. I met her at work.

02:07.335 --> 02:08.294
Oh.

02:09.254 --> 02:11.005
-Happy?
-Fucking ecstatic.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.383
[chimes]

02:15.218 --> 02:16.052
Oh, God.

02:19.264 --> 02:21.266
[both gasp]

02:22.058 --> 02:23.184
-Motherfuck--
-Oh, sh--

02:23.268 --> 02:25.270
[loud crash]

02:25.353 --> 02:26.938
[metal squeaks]

02:28.273 --> 02:30.275
[doorbell rings]

02:31.526 --> 02:34.028
Oh. Hey, Mrs. Harding.

02:34.112 --> 02:35.446
Hi, Parker.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.575
Look, I just wanted
to say I'm really sorry.

02:38.658 --> 02:41.286
I think that we got off
on the wrong foot last night.

02:41.369 --> 02:44.080
[laughs]
Yeah. You were, like, freaking out.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.331
Yeah, that was nothing.

02:45.415 --> 02:47.292
Uh,
that's why I brought you some cupcakes.

02:47.375 --> 02:52.213
Aww, thanks, um, but I don't eat, like,
cupcake dough.

02:52.297 --> 02:55.800
Sure. Uh, actually, you know what?

02:56.217 --> 02:58.178
You posted a picture of Charlie.

02:58.261 --> 02:59.095
Oh, yeah.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.889
He looks like a total snack, right?

03:01.431 --> 03:02.265
Right.

03:02.891 --> 03:03.766
Here's the thing.

03:04.684 --> 03:06.936
Charlie doesn't have a driver's license.

03:07.020 --> 03:11.608
So if anyone saw that picture,
he would get in a lot of trouble.

03:11.691 --> 03:13.443
-Oh, God.
-Yeah.

03:13.526 --> 03:16.529
So I'm gonna need you to, like,
take it down.

03:17.071 --> 03:17.947
Oh.

03:18.656 --> 03:22.118
Tsk. Yeah, see,
I would, because I love Charlie,

03:22.202 --> 03:23.328
but I can't.

03:24.078 --> 03:25.747
Wait, why?

03:25.830 --> 03:26.748
'Cause I get paid.

03:26.998 --> 03:28.833
I'm a micro-influencer, so...

03:29.042 --> 03:31.753
[murmurs] I have no idea
what the fuck you're talking about.

03:31.836 --> 03:35.215
Well, Instagram has, like,
big influencers and small influencers.

03:35.298 --> 03:37.842
This is so fucking embarrassing.

03:38.134 --> 03:40.678
Your mom is just trying to protect you.
She loves you.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.597
Yeah, well,
she's pretty shitty at showing it.

03:43.932 --> 03:44.891
[clears throat]

03:46.809 --> 03:48.519
I lost my virginity in a car.

03:49.437 --> 03:50.313
It was beautiful.

03:50.813 --> 03:51.981
It was a '78 Corvette.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.441
We're not having this conversation.

03:53.524 --> 03:54.400
No? Okay.

03:56.444 --> 03:58.696
Do you like her? Parker.

04:00.198 --> 04:01.115
I don't know.

04:02.617 --> 04:04.744
Whatever. How does anybody know
if they like anybody?

04:04.827 --> 04:05.703
I don't know.

04:07.413 --> 04:08.790
Feel like you...

04:09.958 --> 04:11.417
just like to be around them.

04:13.086 --> 04:16.881
You want to be with them all the time,
and they make you feel safe.

04:17.674 --> 04:18.716
And you can be your...

04:19.968 --> 04:21.386
best self and your...

04:21.886 --> 04:24.597
-when you feel vulnerable--
-Okay, can we not talk anymore?

04:24.681 --> 04:25.515
Yeah.

04:26.724 --> 04:27.558
One more thing.

04:29.185 --> 04:31.646
Please use condoms.
You don't want to get warts.

04:34.607 --> 04:35.817
-Or...
-Yep.

04:35.900 --> 04:38.278
...any other sores down there.

04:38.361 --> 04:40.029
[sighs] Okay.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.782
'Cause if there's oozing,
you're gonna be pretty upset.

04:42.865 --> 04:43.700
[groans]

04:43.783 --> 04:46.786
And so under 800,000 followers is,
like, a whole different pay scale.

04:46.869 --> 04:50.039
Okay, so how much then
for you to take the picture down?

04:50.707 --> 04:51.833
Like, 100 bucks?

04:52.917 --> 04:55.044
That's not a lot of money anymore.
[chuckles]

04:55.128 --> 04:57.380
[murmurs] Oh, fuck you. Um...

04:58.381 --> 04:59.340
Five hundred.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.051
-A thousand dollars.
-[scoffs]

05:02.510 --> 05:04.095
And because you love Charlie,

05:04.178 --> 05:06.764
you will never mention your little outing
to anyone ever.

05:08.599 --> 05:09.559
Okay.

05:09.642 --> 05:10.476
Okay.

05:11.269 --> 05:12.186
Please hold these.

05:17.734 --> 05:18.568
What's...

05:19.193 --> 05:20.111
What are you drawing?

05:21.362 --> 05:22.238
Seriously?

05:22.989 --> 05:23.990
It's a check.

05:26.200 --> 05:27.702
Okay. Uh...

05:27.785 --> 05:28.619
Do you have Venmo?

05:28.703 --> 05:30.038
Do I have what, what?

05:30.413 --> 05:33.541
Oh, you also have to watch out
for chlamydia, gonorrhea,

05:33.624 --> 05:35.835
syphilis, which made
Benjamin Franklin crazy.

05:35.918 --> 05:37.837
I don't know if you know,
but that's what he died of.

05:37.920 --> 05:38.755
-Anyway...
-[Jen sighs]

05:38.838 --> 05:39.881
[Charlie] Oh, thank God.

05:42.091 --> 05:43.134
-How'd that go?
-[Jen sighs]

05:43.676 --> 05:46.429
Expensive,
but she is going to take it down.

05:46.846 --> 05:49.265
Hey, Charlie,
your girlfriend's a little extortionist.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.350
She's not my girlfriend.

05:50.433 --> 05:51.559
She seems to think so.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.186
She said she loved you.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.480
-Oh, Charlie.
-Shit, really?

05:56.606 --> 05:57.482
Char--

05:57.607 --> 06:01.235
Charlie, you need to know that sex is
something different for girls at your age.

06:01.319 --> 06:02.362
At any age.

06:02.445 --> 06:05.281
There are feelings involved.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.784
You just gotta be careful, okay?

06:08.284 --> 06:10.286
I know. Judy told me about warts.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.539
It was part of a larger conversation.

06:13.623 --> 06:16.626
Is that a thing?
Do people even get warts anymore?

06:16.709 --> 06:17.627
There's a vaccine.

06:17.710 --> 06:19.879
-You should get the vaccine.
-[Jen] It's so '70s.

06:19.962 --> 06:21.005
[chiming]

06:21.130 --> 06:22.382
-Oh, shit.
-[Jen] What?

06:24.675 --> 06:26.803
-Why are they calling you?
-I don't know.

06:26.886 --> 06:28.971
-Shouldn't you answer?
-Do I have to?

06:29.597 --> 06:30.932
Miss Hale, thank you for coming.

06:31.015 --> 06:31.849
Of course.

06:32.266 --> 06:33.226
Your hair looks amazing.

06:33.309 --> 06:34.894
-Did you do something different?
-No.

06:35.478 --> 06:37.772
We got some new information pertaining
to Steve Wood.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.065
Oh, you do?

06:39.148 --> 06:42.443
-We've gained access to his phone records.
-Oh!

06:42.527 --> 06:44.153
We've been trying
to piece together a timeline,

06:44.237 --> 06:46.280
and interestingly,
his last calls made were to you.

06:46.781 --> 06:47.615
Were they?

06:47.698 --> 06:50.034
He called you a total of nine times
the night he disappeared.

06:50.118 --> 06:53.663
Oh, that's right.
He called, but I didn't get it.

06:54.038 --> 06:56.165
I just let them go to voicemail.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.000
Hmm. You still have those voicemails?

06:58.334 --> 07:00.503
Hmm. I don't know, I mean, do I?

07:00.586 --> 07:03.339
Miss Hale, we can do this the hard way:
I go to a judge, request a warrant,

07:03.423 --> 07:06.384
but it doesn't look great,
or you could just play me the messages.

07:06.467 --> 07:07.885
-Which do you prefer?
-Neither.

07:07.969 --> 07:09.470
-Neither's not an option.
-Okay.

07:09.554 --> 07:12.348
If there's any information
on those voicemails, I need to know.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.142
-There isn't.
-Prove it.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.978
[exhales]

07:23.234 --> 07:26.404
Do you think that maybe there's somewhere
private that we could listen to them?

07:30.658 --> 07:31.617
[sighs]

07:32.535 --> 07:33.536
[beeps]

07:33.619 --> 07:35.288
[Steve] <i>What the fuck, Judy?</i>

07:35.705 --> 07:37.874
<i>You have some fucking nerve,</i>
<i>you know that? You better call me.</i>

07:37.957 --> 07:40.877
<i>You hear me? Call me,</i> <i>you fucking bitch!</i>

07:43.045 --> 07:45.214
I really appreciate you taking the time
to do this today.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.132
Yeah, well, of course.

07:46.215 --> 07:48.134
But I mean, if you like it,
I would jump on it,

07:48.217 --> 07:49.969
'cause it's not gonna be
on the market for long.

07:50.052 --> 07:51.637
Oh, I'll bet. It's pretty shwanky.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.055
Oh, yeah, it's shwanky.

07:53.389 --> 07:55.141
I mean, yes,
it's more than you wanted to pay,

07:55.224 --> 07:57.810
but it does have a rooftop terrace
with a fire pit,

07:57.894 --> 08:00.271
and of course, the beach is your backyard.

08:00.354 --> 08:03.566
I'm not much of a beach guy.
That's more Steve's deal.

08:03.649 --> 08:06.319
Well, the curtains are remote control,
so you can just shut those

08:06.402 --> 08:08.779
-and not even look out there.
-You know what?

08:08.863 --> 08:10.323
Nothing matters. I'll take it.

08:11.073 --> 08:11.908
-Really?
-Yes.

08:11.991 --> 08:14.327
I just have to get out
of my parents' house.

08:14.410 --> 08:16.704
I have to. The same thing
happens every night.

08:16.787 --> 08:20.208
My mom asks, "When you think we're gonna
find Steve?" I'm like, "Soon, probably."

08:20.291 --> 08:22.043
And then she asks me if I want ice cream.

08:22.126 --> 08:23.503
That's 'cause that's what she wants.

08:23.586 --> 08:25.588
And then I go get the ice cream.
I bring it back.

08:25.671 --> 08:27.548
She cries 'cause I'm not Steve.

08:28.591 --> 08:30.051
And then I eat the ice cream.

08:30.718 --> 08:33.846
-Oh, yeah. That sounds unhealthy.
-Yeah. It is.

08:34.222 --> 08:37.058
I put on 4 LBs. All in my butt.

08:37.808 --> 08:41.145
Well, lots of stairs here,
so you can work that off.

08:41.229 --> 08:43.356
Yeah. My parents are just spiraling,
you know,

08:43.439 --> 08:45.733
and now they're starting
to talk about offering a reward.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.693
[Charlie] A reward for what?

08:48.236 --> 08:49.779
Charlie, not now.

08:49.862 --> 08:53.741
Oh. For anyone that just might know
anything about where my brother could be.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.619
You know, I just feel like...
Don't you feel like...

08:57.078 --> 08:59.830
a reward is just really
a slippery slope, you know?

08:59.914 --> 09:01.040
-[Ben] Yeah.
-Because then it's like giving,

09:01.123 --> 09:03.000
like, a megaphone to all the crazies

09:03.084 --> 09:04.919
so they can just be like,
"Yeah, I've seen him."

09:05.002 --> 09:06.837
-[Ben] Yeah.
-You know, "Down at the mart."

09:06.921 --> 09:09.298
-[Charlie] How much of a reward?
-Charlie, seriously!

09:09.674 --> 09:11.634
-[scoffs]
-[vibrating]

09:11.717 --> 09:14.220
Oh. Oh, I gotta get this.

09:14.303 --> 09:16.305
-Oh, yeah, no problem.
-Um, excuse me.

09:23.688 --> 09:25.523
[Steve] <i>I know you see me calling, bitch.</i>

09:28.276 --> 09:29.235
[beeps]

09:29.318 --> 09:31.612
[Steve] <i>Come on, Jude,</i>
<i>will you just call me, please?</i>

09:31.696 --> 09:33.698
<i>I-- I'm sorry.</i> <i>I love you.</i>

09:33.781 --> 09:35.491
<i>Will you please, please call me back?</i>

09:35.575 --> 09:36.826
<i>I just need to talk to you.</i>

09:37.201 --> 09:38.160
<i>I need you.</i>

09:38.494 --> 09:39.704
<i>Come on, Jude.</i>

09:39.954 --> 09:41.664
<i>Will you call me back, baby, please?</i>

09:41.747 --> 09:42.582
<i>I love you.</i>

09:43.040 --> 09:44.542
<i>All right? Let's work this out.</i>

09:44.625 --> 09:45.501
<i>I love you.</i>

09:48.838 --> 09:51.340
-[beeps]
-<i>You're not gonna get away with this!</i>

09:51.424 --> 09:52.925
<i>You're no fucking angel.</i>

09:53.009 --> 09:55.511
<i>You can't hide forever,</i>
<i>and when I fucking find you,</i>

09:55.595 --> 09:57.513
<i>I am going to fucking kill you!</i>

09:57.597 --> 10:00.057
<i>You hear me? You are fucking dead!</i>

10:04.729 --> 10:05.605
[sniffles]

10:07.189 --> 10:08.649
Oh, I take it he didn't find you.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.529
[sniffles] No.

10:15.698 --> 10:18.784
Are you at all concerned
about your safety, Miss Hale?

10:20.494 --> 10:21.329
What?

10:21.996 --> 10:23.497
Are you afraid he's gonna hurt you?

10:28.252 --> 10:29.086
No.

10:39.722 --> 10:40.556
Char.

10:42.767 --> 10:43.726
Oh, there you are.

10:44.685 --> 10:45.519
Hey.

10:47.313 --> 10:50.149
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ,
now you're smoking?

10:50.650 --> 10:53.486
-[Charlie] Better than vaping.
-[Jen] God, what is wrong with you?

10:53.569 --> 10:54.612
Everything, apparently.

10:54.695 --> 10:57.281
-What, so now, like, nothing matters?
-Not really.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.742
-Anything I do, you're gonna be mad at me.
-You know what?

11:00.409 --> 11:02.787
I don't want to be mad at you,
okay, Charlie?

11:02.870 --> 11:05.164
So help me out here
and do something fucking right.

11:05.247 --> 11:07.833
It's just a stupid cigarette.
It's not like you never do it.

11:08.626 --> 11:10.628
What? What are you talking about?

11:10.711 --> 11:13.756
I've seen the pack you hide on the shelf
in the kitchen where the big bowls are.

11:15.007 --> 11:16.801
Yeah, well, you know what?

11:16.884 --> 11:19.637
I do what I want. I'm an adult.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.806
So you just get to do
whatever the fuck you want?

11:23.182 --> 11:25.059
-Yeah, I do.
-[lighter clicks]

11:27.269 --> 11:30.564
And when you're an adult,
you can, too, but for now,

11:31.023 --> 11:32.066
you are a kid,

11:32.149 --> 11:35.152
and I would try to hold onto that
for as long as you can, honey.

11:35.236 --> 11:37.488
'Cause let me tell you something,
when you get to the other side,

11:37.571 --> 11:40.282
you are gonna have to deal with
some pretty shitty stuff.

11:42.201 --> 11:43.160
Like I haven't?

11:51.210 --> 11:53.295
[cell phone vibrating]

11:55.339 --> 11:56.424
-Hey.
<i>-</i>[Judy] <i>Hey.</i>

11:56.507 --> 11:57.550
What happened?

11:57.633 --> 12:00.386
<i>-It's okay. They haven't found the car.</i>
-Uh-huh.

12:01.512 --> 12:03.514
<i>-But--</i>
-Uh, gotta go. I gotta go.

12:04.348 --> 12:05.850
Hey. Everything all right?

12:07.184 --> 12:08.185
They, uh...

12:10.020 --> 12:11.021
found remains.

12:13.774 --> 12:14.608
What?

12:15.192 --> 12:16.026
Where?

12:16.360 --> 12:17.403
Um...

12:17.486 --> 12:20.781
I don't know. My dad's friend called
from the station, and, uh...

12:21.490 --> 12:24.160
[shuddering] I'm supposed to go down there
or something.

12:24.660 --> 12:28.414
I-- I don't know how to do this. [sighs]

12:28.539 --> 12:31.000
Do you have anyone
that can go with you or...

12:31.542 --> 12:33.294
No. Um...

12:33.919 --> 12:35.713
It's all right. I can go alone.

12:38.424 --> 12:40.551
No, you shouldn't have to do that.

12:42.386 --> 12:43.596
[sighs]

12:45.014 --> 12:45.848
[Jen] Okay.

12:50.311 --> 12:52.313
[sobbing]

12:53.355 --> 12:54.607
[Ben exhales]

13:09.371 --> 13:10.331
[knocks]

13:12.374 --> 13:15.002
Excuse me, ma'am,
you can't be doing that stuff here,

13:15.669 --> 13:17.004
unless you're gonna share.

13:18.130 --> 13:19.465
-Sure.
-[laughs]

13:19.548 --> 13:21.550
But you have to step into my office.

13:31.685 --> 13:33.270
[slow tempo music playing]

13:33.395 --> 13:37.316
Oh, fuck, yes! This song is the best.
[blows smoke]

13:38.150 --> 13:41.278
Actually, no, never mind.
I have never heard this song in my life.

13:41.362 --> 13:43.155
[laughing]

13:43.239 --> 13:46.742
Wait, you're not up on
whatever kind of music this is?

13:46.826 --> 13:47.785
Apparently not.

13:48.452 --> 13:49.703
It's stuck on AM.

13:50.454 --> 13:51.914
But it's very comforting.

13:52.790 --> 13:54.250
-I could see that.
-Yeah.

13:56.418 --> 13:58.546
I'm sorry I ran off last night.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.089
Oh, no, don't...

14:00.464 --> 14:01.298
No stress.

14:01.799 --> 14:04.134
I'm just, uh, I'm sorry you had to go.

14:05.219 --> 14:06.887
I was having a really good time.

14:07.263 --> 14:08.472
Yeah, me too.

14:10.182 --> 14:11.976
And then Jen had an emergency, so--

14:12.059 --> 14:13.269
Is everything okay?

14:14.562 --> 14:15.771
Um...

14:16.355 --> 14:17.648
No...

14:19.525 --> 14:20.734
Her son stole a car.

14:21.902 --> 14:23.529
Oh, shit.

14:23.612 --> 14:24.446
Yeah.

14:25.531 --> 14:28.742
So you're <i>that </i>friend, huh?
You're the clutch friend?

14:29.034 --> 14:30.536
Yes, but she is too.

14:30.995 --> 14:32.621
She's, you know...

14:33.289 --> 14:38.460
She's great. She took me in
when I was kinda in between places.

14:39.587 --> 14:42.798
-So you guys, uh, live together?
-Mm-hmm.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.844
And you're just friends?

14:46.927 --> 14:48.387
Oh, just friends, yeah.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.473
'Cause you're not, uh...

14:51.849 --> 14:52.850
Not with her.

14:57.313 --> 15:00.065
-Is this the moonstone I gave you?
-Yes, yes.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.609
I thought it looked pretty like this.

15:02.443 --> 15:03.360
It does.

15:04.486 --> 15:06.030
It looks really pretty on you.

15:07.197 --> 15:08.032
Thank you.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.664
Should we, um...

15:17.082 --> 15:18.000
maybe...

15:20.169 --> 15:21.545
go get some tacos?

15:24.506 --> 15:26.675
[scoffs] Yeah.

15:27.134 --> 15:30.679
-I am fucking starving.
-[laughing]

15:30.763 --> 15:32.765
[engine turns over]

15:33.432 --> 15:35.851
[siren wailing]

16:05.923 --> 16:06.757
It's not him.

16:07.299 --> 16:08.759
-[both sigh]
-It's not?

16:08.842 --> 16:10.928
Mr. Wood, I know your family
has connections here,

16:11.011 --> 16:12.721
but everyone needs to follow protocol.

16:12.805 --> 16:13.806
Are you sure it's not him?

16:15.599 --> 16:17.977
Forensics just determined
the remains belonged to a female.

16:18.060 --> 16:19.061
-Oh, that's great.
-[sighs]

16:19.478 --> 16:22.523
I mean, uh...
a great tragedy for her family.

16:23.315 --> 16:24.817
[Ben] Yeah. Uh...

16:24.900 --> 16:26.944
-Thank you, Detective.
-Yes, thank you.

16:28.195 --> 16:29.947
I'm sorry.
How do you two know each other?

16:30.447 --> 16:32.074
Oh, I'm helping him find a rental.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.743
-Yeah, Steve's ex introduced us.
-Mm-hmm.

16:35.119 --> 16:35.953
Judy Hale?

16:36.829 --> 16:38.872
-You know Judy?
-I do.

16:38.956 --> 16:40.582
-It's a small town.
-No, it's not.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.334
Ehhh.

16:43.794 --> 16:46.839
Hi, may I have two salmon tacos,

16:46.922 --> 16:48.507
uh, two chicken,

16:48.590 --> 16:50.509
two tofu mushroom burgers?

16:50.592 --> 16:51.468
That's too much.

16:51.552 --> 16:54.179
-Accept your destiny, please.
-[laughs]

16:54.346 --> 16:57.099
Um, one beef burrito, uh...

16:57.182 --> 17:00.561
carnitas nachos, loaded,
and one large guac.

17:00.644 --> 17:02.229
And two Mexican Cokes, please.

17:03.439 --> 17:04.606
That was masterful.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.608
-No, no, I got it.
-[bottles pop open]

17:06.692 --> 17:07.609
Thank you.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.111
[Michelle] Here. Keep the change.

17:09.737 --> 17:10.571
[Judy] Thank you.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.490
[sighs] I love a Mexican Coke.

17:13.574 --> 17:14.992
-Aren't they so much better?
-The best.

17:15.075 --> 17:16.535
-They're real sugar.
-Yes, that's why.

17:16.618 --> 17:18.328
I can't believe
you haven't been here before.

17:18.412 --> 17:20.456
-[Nick] Best tacos in Laguna.
-[gags]

17:20.539 --> 17:23.292
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I just choked for a second.

17:23.375 --> 17:24.334
-Hmm.
-[Judy] This Coke.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.253
-Hey, Nick.
-Hey.

17:26.336 --> 17:28.464
My God, it's great to see you.

17:28.547 --> 17:30.007
[scoffs] Is it?

17:31.216 --> 17:32.342
Hi, I'm Michelle.

17:33.385 --> 17:34.803
-What's up?
-Hi.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.680
How are-- how are you doing?

17:37.264 --> 17:39.600
Well, I left my house today,

17:39.683 --> 17:42.061
so that's a start.

17:43.520 --> 17:44.354
How's...

17:45.105 --> 17:46.482
How's Steve?

17:46.565 --> 17:47.900
-[gags, clears throat]
-[Nick] How's he?

17:47.983 --> 17:49.485
He's, uh...

17:49.610 --> 17:51.028
Who's Steve?

17:51.111 --> 17:54.114
-Oh, that's her boyfriend.
-No. He's my ex-boyfriend.

17:54.698 --> 17:58.535
-That didn't work out.
-Yeah. Guess I know how that goes.

18:00.746 --> 18:03.040
-Hey, it was really nice to meet you.
-You too.

18:03.457 --> 18:04.875
-[Judy] Take care.
-[slurps] Mm.

18:08.378 --> 18:09.213
Drive safely.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.844
-What the fuck was that?
-[sighs] Yeah, right?

18:17.513 --> 18:18.347
-Weird.
-[bell dings]

18:18.430 --> 18:19.848
-[woman] Order's up.
-Oh, that's us.

18:21.850 --> 18:24.645
-[sighs]
-Well, that was a relief, huh?

18:24.728 --> 18:26.188
-Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah.

18:28.816 --> 18:31.235
-[crying]
-Oh. Oh, God, Ben.

18:32.653 --> 18:34.154
-Ben.
-I'm sorry.

18:34.238 --> 18:36.240
It's okay. You don't have to apologize.

18:36.698 --> 18:38.117
I just thought, you know...

18:39.076 --> 18:41.495
I thought for sure it was gonna be Steve.
[sighs]

18:42.788 --> 18:44.456
Well, it wasn't him.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.334
No, I know, but for a minute there,
I thought it was...

18:47.835 --> 18:49.878
I thought it was gonna be him. [exhales]

18:49.962 --> 18:52.673
[inhales] Ooh, God, I feel sick.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.968
-Oh, this is a terrible feeling.
-Mm-hmm.

18:56.051 --> 18:58.387
[sighs, sniffles]

18:58.470 --> 19:00.514
I don't know how people live
with that feeling.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.309
Well, you don't have a choice.

19:04.560 --> 19:06.937
You just learn to cope.

19:10.274 --> 19:11.108
Yeah.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.403
Thank you for coming with me.

19:14.486 --> 19:16.697
I know this is not how you wanted
to spend your afternoon,

19:16.780 --> 19:18.657
-at a police station.
-Oh, it's okay.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.410
You're a very kind realtor.<i> </i>[laughs]

19:21.493 --> 19:22.536
Can I, um...

19:22.619 --> 19:24.705
pay you back with a mocktail? [chuckles]

19:24.830 --> 19:26.790
Oh, uh, I-- I can't.

19:27.207 --> 19:29.459
Yours doesn't have to be a mock,
it can be a cock...

19:29.543 --> 19:30.377
Cocktail.

19:31.086 --> 19:34.548
No, I got it.
Uh, no, actually, I have to go.

19:34.631 --> 19:37.134
My son is singing his first solo
with his...

19:38.051 --> 19:39.303
Always so hard to say.

19:39.386 --> 19:41.388
...his Christian rock choral group.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.016
Wait.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.727
Are you talking about the Holy Harmonies?

19:48.020 --> 19:49.104
Why do you know that?

19:49.730 --> 19:50.606
[laughs]

19:51.773 --> 19:55.110
Holy Harmonizer, '86 through '89.

19:55.652 --> 19:57.571
-Really?
-Yes. [laughs]

19:57.654 --> 19:59.239
Actually, I'm not surprised by that.

19:59.323 --> 20:02.451
Wow, that's great!
Oh, I'd love to see that.

20:02.534 --> 20:06.788
I mean, not that, you know,
I'm self-inviting or anything.

20:07.414 --> 20:08.790
You are, though, aren't you?

20:09.416 --> 20:11.043
-I mean, it's been a while.
-Okay.

20:11.126 --> 20:13.545
-The more the merrier.
-And...

20:14.004 --> 20:15.172
-Really?
-Sure.

20:15.255 --> 20:18.967
Oh, fantastic news. [sighs]

20:19.384 --> 20:20.719
-My cup of tizzle.
-Mm-hmm.

20:22.095 --> 20:24.348
Well, we only dated for a little bit.

20:25.307 --> 20:28.268
He's actually really sweet.
Just didn't end so great.

20:28.644 --> 20:30.062
[laughs] Yeah, that was obvious.

20:30.687 --> 20:33.023
-I feel like I'm gonna need the story.
-[groans]

20:33.565 --> 20:36.026
The story doesn't really paint me
in the greatest light.

20:36.443 --> 20:37.945
Well, now I want to hear more.

20:41.490 --> 20:45.535
I thought I was pregnant
