14:05.636 --> 14:08.764
Maybe another about his first love.

14:09.139 --> 14:10.641
And maybe one...

14:11.475 --> 14:13.477
about the death of his father.

14:13.978 --> 14:20.442
Monologues, when spoken
by a great actor, is like,

14:20.776 --> 14:24.029
hmm, it's like. It's like. It's like...

14:24.113 --> 14:26.574
Oh. Yeah, cheesecake to a fat guy.

14:26.657 --> 14:31.453
Oh, yes! Yes, exactly.
You get it. Okay, you get it.

14:32.413 --> 14:34.290
You're a great actor, Oliver.

14:34.373 --> 14:37.668
And the world needs
to see your greatness.

14:38.127 --> 14:40.004
The world needs to see--

14:40.087 --> 14:42.339
[shouts] Needs to see my greatness.

14:42.423 --> 14:43.799
Yes!

14:43.883 --> 14:46.135
Okay. All right.

14:46.218 --> 14:47.261
[chuckles]

14:47.344 --> 14:48.846
You know me so well.

14:48.929 --> 14:50.848
It's like you're in my head.

14:52.308 --> 14:55.519
Like a tick or a wing.

Follow me, my loyal aide-de-camp.

15:10.367 --> 15:12.995
-[McQuaid] You still feel nothing?
-Zippo.

15:13.078 --> 15:15.331
But as long as Oliver is having fun.

15:15.414 --> 15:18.250
His fun is more important than my fun.

15:18.334 --> 15:22.087
You have to be selfless when you're
in a mature relationship like ours.

15:22.546 --> 15:23.756
Right.

15:24.798 --> 15:28.677
I mean, you could almost say that
his fun is my fun.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.513
Like, we're one, you know?

15:31.805 --> 15:33.599
It's like we're connected.

15:34.266 --> 15:35.100
Okay.

15:35.184 --> 15:37.853
-You sure that nutmeg isn't working yet?
-[scoffs]

15:40.522 --> 15:42.399
How come you never smile?

15:42.858 --> 15:44.485
I-I smile.

15:44.568 --> 15:45.569
I smile often.

15:45.653 --> 15:48.489
I'm a degenerate smiler of smiles. Um...

15:50.157 --> 15:53.869
[chuckles] Okay, wait, that is not...
no, that is not a smile.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.829
That is a creep face.

15:57.247 --> 16:00.084
Alas, I suffer from creep face.

16:00.167 --> 16:02.419
You're such a weird freshman, McQuaid.

16:03.754 --> 16:08.092
But it's true. All the McQuaid men have
creep face dating back hundreds of years

16:08.175 --> 16:10.260
to when the Cossacks were chasing us.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.138
You don't laugh either.

16:13.764 --> 16:17.017
Laughter's not the only way
to show that something is funny.

16:17.101 --> 16:18.519
-Is that a fact?
-Sure.

16:18.602 --> 16:21.605
Do something funny.
I'll react without laughter.

16:22.189 --> 16:23.232
Okay.

16:24.817 --> 16:25.859
[mimics pig snort]

16:26.777 --> 16:30.656

You can't just do something funny.

16:37.037 --> 16:40.207
Hello. Pinecone and Company.

16:40.916 --> 16:43.502
Mr. McQuaid.

16:44.128 --> 16:46.005
He's right here.

16:46.088 --> 16:47.381
Please hold.

16:51.260 --> 16:53.012
[whispers] It's for you.

16:57.182 --> 16:58.642
[normal voice] Was that funny?

17:00.561 --> 17:01.645

17:02.604 --> 17:03.647
[Tyler] Guys?

17:03.731 --> 17:06.567
Um, w-we got a problem.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.994
Oliver, what the hell?

17:17.077 --> 17:19.371
The world can see me from up here.

17:19.455 --> 17:22.207
[sighs] And see my greatness.

17:22.291 --> 17:24.001
You hear that, Boring?

17:24.668 --> 17:26.795
I don't need you.

17:26.879 --> 17:28.630
All right, come down.

17:28.714 --> 17:30.799
I am cheesecake to a fat man.

17:32.176 --> 17:33.761
What'd he say?

17:33.844 --> 17:34.845
It's a long story.

17:34.928 --> 17:38.265
You really should come down.
Never mix drugs with heights.

17:38.849 --> 17:40.893
Yeah, perhaps you are right.

17:40.976 --> 17:43.395
I can be lofty without being aloft.

17:43.479 --> 17:44.897
Just be careful!

I am the Nutmeg King.

-Okay.

17:54.323 --> 17:55.532
I can't...

17:56.909 --> 17:57.951
I can't get down.

17:58.660 --> 18:01.497
Okay, I can't get down.

18:02.623 --> 18:04.917
-Oh, God, I can't get down.

Stop laughing.

Hello. Squirrel Police?

18:20.307 --> 18:21.934
I have an emergency.

We can pay you in nuts.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.813
[laughing continues]

18:26.688 --> 18:28.524
I said stop laughing at me.

18:29.691 --> 18:31.318
It's not funny.
