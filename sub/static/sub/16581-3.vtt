About what?

02:04.000 --> 02:04.910
You.

02:05.126 --> 02:06.741
Me?
What have I done?

02:06.961 --> 02:08.451
Exactly what I
hired you to do.

02:08.671 --> 02:10.707
You've been helping my people
navigate a legal system

02:10.923 --> 02:12.663
built to
disenfranchise them.

02:13.259 --> 02:15.045
That is what you've
been doing, isn't it?

02:15.428 --> 02:16.793
I've been trying.

02:17.096 --> 02:18.802
I've been going through Mathias'
old cases

02:19.015 --> 02:20.971
and reaching out to people
on the res --

02:21.183 --> 02:22.389
Putting up fliers.

02:22.602 --> 02:24.138

that would be --

02:31.986 --> 02:33.442
For a lot of my people,

02:33.654 --> 02:36.521
the most frightening words
they can hear are,

02:36.741 --> 02:39.608
"I'm a concerned white person,
and I'm here to help."

02:40.328 --> 02:42.694
You just put a bull's-eye
on yourself.

02:42.913 --> 02:45.620
And it doesn't help that
the first tribal casino checks

02:45.833 --> 02:46.822
went out this week.

02:47.418 --> 02:48.282
Isn't that a good thing?

02:48.502 --> 02:50.367
Yeah, but it's not
a life-changing thing,

02:50.588 --> 02:53.500
and that's what people were
expecting.

02:53.716 --> 02:55.832
So when they see your fliers --

02:56.052 --> 02:58.259
They wonder if I'm the reason
their checks aren't any bigger.

02:58.471 --> 02:59.586
Oh, yeah.

03:00.139 --> 03:02.221
Then maybe we need to show
the tribe that the money

03:02.433 --> 03:04.424
you're investing in me
is actually for them.

03:04.644 --> 03:05.724
And how do we do that?

03:07.313 --> 03:08.849
With something visible.

03:10.107 --> 03:11.563
I could start by opening up
an office

03:11.776 --> 03:14.438
on the reservation,
paying rent, utilities.

03:14.654 --> 03:16.610
Yeah, interesting --
something visible.

03:21.702 --> 03:24.079
Just keep in mind,

Oh, it's perfectly okay.

04:50.291 --> 04:52.782

Sometimes it's better just

04:53.002 --> 04:54.867
to keep things in house
like this.

04:55.087 --> 04:57.043
l- I know, I should have called
the tribal police,

04:57.256 --> 04:59.793
but she lives in the county,
and l -- It's habit.

05:00.009 --> 05:01.715
If he were my dad,
I think I'd --

05:01.927 --> 05:04.384
-I think I might do
the same thing.
-He's here.

05:05.890 --> 05:08.131
Hey. Thank you so
much for coming.

-Where is she?

05:14.398 --> 05:16.434
Um -- Oh, she's over there.

05:20.321 --> 05:21.561
Any sign of her father?

05:21.781 --> 05:23.487
We're still searching
the premises.

05:24.074 --> 05:25.154
Her name's Olivia Parr.

05:25.326 --> 05:26.406
She's 10 years old.

05:26.619 --> 05:28.029
Her father, Vincent,
told her to wait

05:28.245 --> 05:30.497
in the car while
he came in here.

05:30.706 --> 05:33.789
Don't worry, honey.
Mr. Malachi has old-man's eyes.

05:34.084 --> 05:37.622
But I bet Miss Cady will have
better luck finding your pop.

05:37.838 --> 05:41.581
And maybe...
a sody pop, too.

05:41.801 --> 05:43.666
[chuckles]
Come on, Olivia. Come with me.

05:46.597 --> 05:48.883
Aw, there's no sign
of the deadbeat anywhere.

Poor girl's putting on a
brave face, but she's terrified.

05:52.061 --> 05:53.972
Do you know what time
her father came in here?

05:54.188 --> 05:55.769
The girl thinks
she was waiting in the car

05:55.981 --> 05:57.972
for a couple of hours,
but, uh...

05:58.984 --> 06:01.191
she's a 10-year-old kid,
so it's hard to tell.

06:02.321 --> 06:06.280

you could take her home.

in one of the hotel rooms

side action, huh?

Why were you in your car?

08:38.268 --> 08:39.348
I got worried

08:39.561 --> 08:42.769
when Vincent and Olivia
didn't come home last night.

08:43.482 --> 08:46.224
I tried calling a bunch
of times, but no one answered.

08:46.443 --> 08:47.193
And then...

08:49.154 --> 08:51.065
After that,
it gets a little fuzzy.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.605
Anything you can
remember helps.

08:55.869 --> 08:56.733
Uh...

08:58.122 --> 09:00.033
I remember
going to the garage.

After that...
just cold water.

Okay if I work on it?

09:12.177 --> 09:14.338
Well, it's --
it's 4:00 in the morning.

09:14.638 --> 09:16.219
Maybe you should get some rest.

09:16.432 --> 09:19.265
But I'll get a bad grade
if I don't turn it in on time.

09:19.518 --> 09:21.349
Well, go ahead, honey.

09:21.562 --> 09:23.302
And if Dad doesn't
get home soon,

09:50.924 --> 09:53.256
Jacob Nighthorse hired me
to open a legal-aid center.

09:53.802 --> 09:55.383
You are working for Jacob?

09:56.722 --> 09:57.837
Does Walt know about this?

09:58.057 --> 09:59.513
He does.

09:59.725 --> 10:01.340
And he also knows
that I am a grown adult,

10:01.560 --> 10:03.926
fully capable of making
my own decisions.

10:06.023 --> 10:07.763
Did you tell him
or did he figure it out?

10:07.983 --> 10:08.938
No, I told him.

10:10.194 --> 10:11.309
I didn't tell him
everything.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.026
What did you leave out?

10:14.990 --> 10:16.855
How much money
Jacob gave me.

10:17.785 --> 10:19.025
How much did he give you?

10:19.995 --> 10:21.610
750,000.

10:21.830 --> 10:22.865
Dollars?

10:23.082 --> 10:24.071
Yes.

10:26.001 --> 10:27.161
That is generous.

-You're upset.
-I am surprised.

10:30.547 --> 10:32.412
Well, apparently you're not
the only one.

There's already been
complaints.

10:34.259 --> 10:36.545
Jacob made a lot of promises to
the tribe.

10:36.762 --> 10:39.048
How much were
these tribal casino checks?

10:39.264 --> 10:42.006
About $745,000 less
than yours.

10:42.226 --> 10:43.432
Oh.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.556
Henry, do you have any idea

10:47.773 --> 10:50.105
where I can find
some office space on the res?

10:50.818 --> 10:53.525
So I can start putting this
money back into the community?

10:53.737 --> 10:56.353
There is not much in the way
of traditional office space.

10:56.573 --> 11:00.612
You may have to be
nontraditional in your thinking.

to turn in her book report.

conscientious.

11:18.262 --> 11:19.752

11:19.972 --> 11:22.759
I wanted to ask you a few
questions about Olivia's father.

Four Arrows Casino last night.

That doesn't sound like him.

11:45.956 --> 11:48.322
-Unless...
-Unless what?

11:48.542 --> 11:52.330
It's unprofessional to gossip
about a student's home life.

11:52.546 --> 11:54.161
Well, it's not unprofessional
to help locate

11:54.381 --> 11:55.791
a student's missing parent.

11:56.592 --> 12:01.427
It's possible that Olivia's
mother got herself into trouble

12:01.638 --> 12:04.425
and Vincent needed money
to bail her out.

12:04.641 --> 12:06.177
What kind of trouble?

12:06.393 --> 12:10.136
I can't prove anything,
but when I do see her,

12:10.355 --> 12:14.439
which is rare...
she's real jittery.

of one of my students,

12:30.167 --> 12:31.031
Okay.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.825
If something has happened
to Vincent,

12:34.046 --> 12:36.503
do you think Olivia would be
safe in her mother's care?

12:38.383 --> 12:41.750
I really can't give you
an honest answer on that.

12:46.391 --> 12:47.346
[door opens]

12:51.563 --> 12:53.064
Did you find Vincent?

12:53.273 --> 12:54.604
[Walt]
No luck so far,

12:54.816 --> 12:58.855
but Deputy Ferguson is still
at the casino searching, so...

12:59.529 --> 13:00.814
Should I be worried?

13:01.031 --> 13:02.646
Well, that casino
is pretty big.

13:02.866 --> 13:05.323
It's gonna take a while
to cover the whole place, um...

13:08.038 --> 13:10.404
Do you know why your husband
was at the casino last night?

13:10.707 --> 13:11.867
[sighs] No.

13:12.084 --> 13:13.574
The last I knew, he and Olivia

13:13.794 --> 13:15.409
were driving back
from getting gas.

13:16.004 --> 13:17.119
Is that true?

13:17.589 --> 13:18.374
No.

13:18.966 --> 13:21.048
We were at the
gas station earlier.

13:21.260 --> 13:24.002
We had just arrived at
the casino when Dad called Mom.

13:24.763 --> 13:26.719
Why'd your dad fib
to your mom?

13:27.766 --> 13:30.132
Dad said the casino
was our secret.

13:30.352 --> 13:31.808
He said it was okay

13:32.020 --> 13:34.056
since he'd won so much money
the night before.

13:35.023 --> 13:36.433
The night before?

13:39.319 --> 13:40.775
How much money did he win?

13:42.072 --> 13:43.107
I don't know.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.984
Olivia, do you mind giving me

13:45.200 --> 13:46.906
a few minutes alone
with your mother?

13:47.119 --> 13:49.826
Ms. Safford gave me
your worksheets for today.

13:50.038 --> 13:53.075
Now, I know Ruby would be happy
to help you if you need it.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.453
Okay.

14:01.675 --> 14:02.915
Um...

14:06.388 --> 14:09.255
I'm sorry if this is
a little direct,

14:09.474 --> 14:11.556
but does Vincent have
a gambling problem?

14:12.936 --> 14:14.676
No, I don't think so.

14:14.896 --> 14:16.932
You didn't know he was
at the casino either night?

14:17.482 --> 14:18.597
No, I didn't.

14:18.817 --> 14:21.399
Does your family have
financial problems right now?

14:21.611 --> 14:22.566
No.

14:22.779 --> 14:26.943
Vincent's job at the high school
is the best job he's ever had.

14:30.412 --> 14:32.448
So, if you didn't know
he was at the casino,

14:32.664 --> 14:34.074
where'd you think he was?

14:37.711 --> 14:39.326
I didn't think
about it, really.

14:40.505 --> 14:43.622
Well, Vincent usually picks up
Olivia after school

14:43.842 --> 14:47.585
and then takes her to her
math tutor or piano practice.

14:47.804 --> 14:50.887
After that, sometimes they
pick up dinner or groceries

14:51.099 --> 14:52.259
and they head home.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.509
What time do
they usually come home?

14:57.814 --> 14:59.020
I don't know.

14:59.941 --> 15:00.896
Why not?

15:02.819 --> 15:04.901
I'm not always awake
when they get home.

15:06.990 --> 15:07.945
[knock on door]

15:08.158 --> 15:09.068
Yeah?

15:09.534 --> 15:12.071
Walt, can I talk to you?

15:12.788 --> 15:13.573
Yeah.

15:14.873 --> 15:16.079
Excuse me.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.628
[Ruby]
Ferg just called.

15:23.840 --> 15:26.627
A body turned up --
middle-aged male.

15:26.843 --> 15:28.834
And it fits Vincent Parr's
description.

15:31.890 --> 15:32.925
Okay.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.807
I'll take a ride
out to the casino.

15:35.977 --> 15:37.717
Oh, he's not
at the casino.

15:37.979 --> 15:40.721
Ferg said the body is on the
other side of the county,

15:41.441 --> 15:42.897
20 miles away.

15:54.579 --> 15:55.830
What's the bus
doing here?

15:56.039 --> 15:57.995
One of the kids found the body
when they were walking

15:58.208 --> 16:00.574
from that trailer park
over there to the bus stop.

16:00.794 --> 16:02.659
Driver felt conflicted
about leaving a dead body.

16:02.879 --> 16:04.494
How'd he feel about exposing
a bus full of kids

16:04.714 --> 16:05.965
to emotional trauma?

16:06.174 --> 16:08.039
Well, I covered the body up,
but I don't think

16:08.260 --> 16:10.467
we need to worry about
these kids being traumatized.

16:10.679 --> 16:12.635
[Walt]
Tell the driver he can leave.

16:12.848 --> 16:15.430
Tell those kids to erase those
pictures from their phones.

16:16.351 --> 16:18.262
[engine starts]

16:25.360 --> 16:26.395
[Vic]
Is that the father?

16:27.904 --> 16:29.155
Looks like him.

16:30.073 --> 16:31.654
[Ferg] If he was last seen
at the casino,

16:31.867 --> 16:33.152
what's he doing
all the way out here?

16:33.827 --> 16:35.158
I don't know.

16:35.370 --> 16:37.076
You find out anything else
at the casino?

16:37.289 --> 16:38.654
Not really.

16:38.874 --> 16:41.365
Malachi couldn't locate
any footage of Vincent Parr.

16:41.585 --> 16:43.792
Isn't that sort of what you
expect Malachi to say, though,

16:44.004 --> 16:46.290
if he and his goons are still
ripping off the big winners?

16:46.506 --> 16:48.747
You know, Olivia said
that her father won big.

16:50.051 --> 16:51.461
There's no money in his wallet.

16:53.847 --> 16:56.429
[Walt] He's got these marks
across his stomach and chest.

16:57.726 --> 16:59.091
Looks like
he was run over.

16:59.769 --> 17:01.020
Anything else in his pockets?

17:01.646 --> 17:03.182
There's no keys.

17:03.398 --> 17:05.434
Just a broken phone
and, uh, this.

17:14.951 --> 17:17.488
Ferg, let's get Vincent Parr's
body to the hospital.

17:18.330 --> 17:19.570
If the kid who found the body

17:19.789 --> 17:21.165
was coming over
from the trailer park,

17:21.374 --> 17:22.875
I'm gonna go over there
and ask some questions,

17:23.084 --> 17:24.494
see if anybody saw anything.

17:24.711 --> 17:27.498
If they didn't, maybe someone
saw something at the casino.

17:29.174 --> 17:31.130
[Malachi] Well, see,
that's the downside of running

17:31.343 --> 17:34.756
150 state-of-the-art
security cameras 24/7.

17:34.971 --> 17:37.303
There's lots and lots of movies.

17:37.516 --> 17:39.302
I'm still looking
through them all.

17:40.602 --> 17:41.261
Right.

17:41.478 --> 17:44.311
Always happy to cooperate
with an investigation, Sheriff.

17:44.523 --> 17:46.730
Which is now
a murder investigation.

17:47.526 --> 17:49.812
Vincent Parr's body was found
in my county.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.234
According to
the victim's daughter,

17:52.447 --> 17:54.904
he came here the last two nights
and he was winning.

17:55.116 --> 17:58.074
| find it surprising
that you have no record of this.

17:59.746 --> 18:00.826
Surprising, is it?

18:01.039 --> 18:02.449
So, what are you thinking?

18:02.666 --> 18:04.873
You think, uh,
we're covering something up?

18:05.085 --> 18:06.370
Maybe it's just due
to negligence

18:06.586 --> 18:08.292
on the part
of your security team, Jacob.

18:11.341 --> 18:13.423
Malachi, please keep reviewing
the video --

18:13.635 --> 18:16.342
every single thing
from the last 48 hours.

18:23.645 --> 18:27.012
Vincent Parr had his wallet.
None of his winnings were in it.

18:27.232 --> 18:29.439
Malachi's loan-sharking
and mugging scheme

18:29.651 --> 18:30.766
may have just escalated.

18:30.986 --> 18:33.773
Okay, you have no proof
of this scheme.

18:34.197 --> 18:36.153
I won't, either,
as long as Malachi's

18:36.366 --> 18:38.573
the one in charge
of investigating himself.

18:39.077 --> 18:41.238
You have any other, uh,
theories right now,

18:41.454 --> 18:44.036
aside from these insane levels
of corruption

18:44.249 --> 18:46.160
-in my organization?
-I do.

18:47.836 --> 18:51.454
Something happened in room 503
of your hotel.

18:55.218 --> 18:56.424
[Vic] Hello?
[knock on door]

19:02.309 --> 19:03.389
Anyone there?

19:05.186 --> 19:05.971
[man]
Hey, there.

19:06.187 --> 19:09.429
Everyone's welcome at the
Chrysalis Mobile Home Villa,

19:09.649 --> 19:12.607
where caterpillars blossom
into butterflies.

19:13.528 --> 19:15.393
If you're looking for
a new house,

19:15.614 --> 19:18.196
I got three cozy units
available.

19:18.408 --> 19:20.069
I'll take that
under consideration.

19:20.285 --> 19:21.900
-Are you the manager?
-Yes, ma'am.

19:22.120 --> 19:25.283
Folks call me Joe Mega, because
I used to be a mega partier,

19:25.498 --> 19:28.035
but now I'm
just mega-blessed.

19:28.251 --> 19:29.661
Okay, Mr. Mega.

19:29.878 --> 19:31.664
Did you happen to see
anything unusual last night?

19:31.880 --> 19:33.245
No. Why?

19:34.507 --> 19:38.967
This man was found dead
practically in your backyard.

19:40.180 --> 19:42.717
And he was driving this car.

19:43.308 --> 19:45.970
I don't know that car,
and this man's not dead.

19:46.186 --> 19:47.141
He's not?

19:47.354 --> 19:48.514
Death isn't death.

19:48.730 --> 19:50.721
It's just another
stage of life.

19:50.940 --> 19:52.851
An eternal chrysalis.

19:53.068 --> 19:55.901
I'll let the victim know.
I'm sure he'll be delighted.

19:56.112 --> 19:57.648
In the meantime,

19:57.864 --> 20:02.028
if you or any of your
butterflies remember anything,

20:02.243 --> 20:04.404
go ahead and, uh,
give us a call.

20:04.621 --> 20:05.701
Yes, ma'am.

20:05.914 --> 20:06.778
Okay.

20:09.125 --> 20:13.084
Caitlyn, who was staying
in room 503 the last two nights?

20:14.381 --> 20:16.747
It appears 503 is being
held for 10 days

20:16.966 --> 20:18.217
by a corporate account --

20:18.426 --> 20:20.417
a company called
Manifest Destinations.

20:20.637 --> 20:22.719
Anyone use the room last night
or the night before?

20:24.015 --> 20:25.391
No.
Doesn't look like it.

20:25.600 --> 20:26.510
Thank you.

20:28.770 --> 20:31.011
We shut down Malachi's
last Ioan-sharking office

20:31.231 --> 20:33.187
in the casino men's bathroom.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.391
Maybe he's upgraded
to a hotel suite.

20:35.610 --> 20:38.147
Or maybe --
you know, just maybe --

20:38.363 --> 20:40.354
the numbers
five zero three

20:40.573 --> 20:42.985
refer to something
other than a room in my hotel.

20:43.410 --> 20:45.196
Why don't you let me know
what you and Malachi find

20:45.412 --> 20:46.697
on those security tapes.

20:47.747 --> 20:48.907
Yeah.

20:58.466 --> 21:01.128
Caitlyn, how often
has Manifest Destinations

21:01.302 --> 21:02.462
booked rooms with us?

21:04.431 --> 21:05.591
Quite often, actually.

21:06.516 --> 21:07.756
Huh.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.640
Print me out a record, please,
and,uh,

21:09.853 --> 21:12.515
notify me
of any further reservations.

21:12.731 --> 21:14.346
And you know what?

21:14.566 --> 21:16.978
Let's just keep this
between you and me, okay?

21:26.161 --> 21:29.073
Hey, sir.
Do you travel this road a lot?

21:29.289 --> 21:30.495
Oh, yes, ma'am.

21:30.707 --> 21:32.038
Me and Tito here,

21:32.250 --> 21:34.081
we scoot
just about everywhere.

21:34.294 --> 21:35.909
See anything unusual
last night?

21:36.129 --> 21:38.120
It's about that
crazy lady, right?

21:38.339 --> 21:39.590
[clears throat]

21:41.676 --> 21:42.540
Yeah.

21:43.261 --> 21:44.421
Where'd you see her?

21:44.637 --> 21:46.343
Oh, right back there.

21:46.556 --> 21:48.717
We were riding out
for a late-night milkshake.

21:48.933 --> 21:50.924
And she pulled
right up to us.

21:51.436 --> 21:52.801
Said she was
looking for a car.

21:53.354 --> 21:54.264
What kind of car?

21:54.481 --> 21:57.939
Blue -- royal blue.
[chuckles]

21:58.485 --> 22:00.646
And, uh, what
did she look like?

22:00.862 --> 22:03.069
We didn't really get
a good look, did we?

22:03.615 --> 22:07.324
l-lt was dark,
and the poor thing, she --

22:07.535 --> 22:10.072
she just seemed afraid to show
herself.

22:10.288 --> 22:12.324
Paws over her face
and everything.

22:13.082 --> 22:14.822
She -- She
was super shaky.

22:15.043 --> 22:16.999
Goofed out on
something, probably.

22:17.212 --> 22:21.797
When we asked what was wrong,
she just freaked out, sped off.

22:22.008 --> 22:23.043
Huh.

22:23.551 --> 22:26.918
And, uh,
what was she driving?

22:27.138 --> 22:30.130
Oh, one of those little
S.U.V.s -- a Honda.

22:30.350 --> 22:32.591
And it had
one of those cutesy-pie

22:32.811 --> 22:36.224
mom, dad, and kid stick-figure
stickers on the back window.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.939
I found the girl's mom
passed out in a Honda

22:40.151 --> 22:41.482
with the same sticker on it.

22:41.694 --> 22:43.309
So what?
You think the mom did it?

22:43.530 --> 22:44.519
I don't know.

22:46.282 --> 22:46.987
Okay.

22:48.368 --> 22:50.905
You want me to call child
services about the little girl?

22:51.830 --> 22:54.196
I mean, technically,
we're supposed to, right?

22:54.415 --> 22:56.792
Technically, but there's
something I have to do first.

23:38.960 --> 23:39.915
We found Vincent.

23:41.421 --> 23:42.661
You found my dad?

23:44.549 --> 23:46.961
We're still trying to figure out
what happened.

23:48.970 --> 23:50.380
Unfortunately, he...

23:51.598 --> 23:55.011
...your father was injured
very badly, and...

23:56.644 --> 23:58.350
...he didn't survive.

23:58.563 --> 23:59.598
Mom.

23:59.814 --> 24:01.054
I'm very sorry.

24:02.066 --> 24:04.523
Mom, Dad's dead!

24:04.736 --> 24:07.227
[sobs]

24:07.447 --> 24:08.186
Mom!

24:08.406 --> 24:11.193
[whimpering]

24:11.409 --> 24:12.865
[echoin
9
Mom! ]

24:24.005 --> 24:25.211
[engine shuts off]

24:32.305 --> 24:34.967
You didn't have to come
all the way out here, you know.

24:35.183 --> 24:38.095
I would've found the place...
eventually.

24:38.311 --> 24:39.972
Finding the place was not
my concern.

24:40.188 --> 24:41.394
Your safety was.

24:42.398 --> 24:44.229
You love me like a father,
don't you?

24:45.652 --> 24:46.732
Yes, I do.

24:47.570 --> 24:49.947
You're also underestimating me
like a father.

25:03.503 --> 25:04.959
Henry, I can't use this
as an office.

25:05.171 --> 25:06.160
This is someone's home.

25:06.381 --> 25:08.121
It was foreclosed
last month.

25:20.103 --> 25:21.058
[sighs]

25:21.270 --> 25:23.261
Are there any other options?

25:23.481 --> 25:24.470
Yes.

25:25.400 --> 25:28.233
Other foreclosed homes
in worse condition than this.

25:28.444 --> 25:32.312
[cellphone ringing]

25:39.914 --> 25:41.120
This is Henry.

25:41.332 --> 25:43.823
[Jacob]
Ah. So your phone does work.

25:44.669 --> 25:47.706
l was beginning to wonder
why I haven't heard from you.

25:47.922 --> 25:49.423
l have been somewhat
busy lately.

25:49.632 --> 25:50.712
Is that right?

25:50.925 --> 25:52.665
You find a better way to get
your bar back

25:52.885 --> 25:53.715
than by helping me?

25:53.928 --> 25:55.008
l have not.

25:55.221 --> 25:56.381
I didn't think so.

25:58.141 --> 26:00.723
Which means we need
to have a talk

26:00.935 --> 26:05.269
about what exactly Malachi
is up to.

26:19.912 --> 26:22.449
[clears throat, sniffs]

26:49.609 --> 26:53.193
Hi. Donna?
It's me, Walt -- Longmire.

26:53.404 --> 26:56.521
Um, I guess I left a message
or two already.

26:56.741 --> 26:58.527
Um, this is work-related.

26:58.743 --> 27:02.406
Um, I've got a young girl
whose father was found dead.

27:02.747 --> 27:04.283
She's here with her mother.

27:04.957 --> 27:06.288
She's a little unstable.

27:06.501 --> 27:09.618
I'd like to put off calling, uh,
social services

27:09.837 --> 27:11.088
as long as I can.

27:11.297 --> 27:13.709
So I could use some
professional guidance.

27:14.801 --> 27:16.541
You could call me back here

27:16.761 --> 27:19.628
or, uh, just call Ruby,
if that's easier.

27:20.515 --> 27:21.425
Okay.

27:23.559 --> 27:25.060
[sighs]

27:30.900 --> 27:33.391
[indistinct conversations]

27:51.379 --> 27:53.870
[cellphone ringing, vibrating]

27:55.174 --> 27:56.334
Damn.

27:57.301 --> 27:58.507
Hey, Ruby.

27:58.719 --> 28:00.334
[Walt]
Any word from the coroner yet?

28:00.555 --> 28:02.511
Oh, hey, Sheriff.
Yeah.

28:02.723 --> 28:05.214
Vincent Parr was crushed
to death, just as we thought.

28:05.810 --> 28:08.347
Someone ran him over
in the last eight to 18 hours.

28:10.189 --> 28:12.396
You know, I'm -- I'm happy to
wait here.

28:12.608 --> 28:15.270
You know, just wait for
the results and the blood work.

28:15.486 --> 28:16.726
No.
That could take hours.

28:16.946 --> 28:18.686
I need you to get over
to the Parr house.

28:18.906 --> 28:20.817
Take a look
underneath the wife's car.

28:21.367 --> 28:22.903
You think the wife
ran him over?

28:23.119 --> 28:25.235
Well, if she did, there'd be
damage to the undercarriage.

28:25.454 --> 28:26.580
On it.

28:29.500 --> 28:31.161
Can Olivia and | go now?

28:32.628 --> 28:33.583
Soon.

28:36.299 --> 28:38.460
We still need your help
in our investigation,

28:38.676 --> 28:41.008
um, answering
some background questions.

28:41.929 --> 28:43.305
Okay.

28:43.514 --> 28:45.630
When we found you
in your car last night,

28:45.850 --> 28:48.637
um, you remembered getting
into it but nothing after that?

28:49.187 --> 28:53.601
Yeah, that's right.
lt's...all a blank.

28:53.816 --> 28:55.397
Is it possible
that you drove out

28:55.610 --> 28:57.191
to look for your husband
and daughter?

28:58.779 --> 29:00.110
Idon-- I don't know.

29:02.241 --> 29:04.698
-Did I?
-Apparently, you stopped
to talk to a man

29:04.911 --> 29:07.618
while driving out near
where Vincent's body was found.

29:09.207 --> 29:10.617
I don't remember that
at all.

29:11.626 --> 29:12.832
What did I say to him?

29:13.878 --> 29:16.369
You asked him if he'd seen
Vincent's royal blue sedan.

29:17.006 --> 29:18.166
ReaHy?

29:18.382 --> 29:20.634
Well, | -- I guess
if he saw me...

29:21.552 --> 29:25.010
I mean, I -- l was really --
really worried about them.

29:25.223 --> 29:27.509
If you were worried
about your husband and daughter,

29:27.725 --> 29:29.431
why didn't you just call us?

29:29.644 --> 29:33.228
Well, some-- sometimes when I
get all worked up about things,

29:33.439 --> 29:35.555
um, and I think
something's happened,

29:36.692 --> 29:37.943
like, a part of me knows
it might --

29:38.152 --> 29:39.892
mightjust all be
in my head.

29:40.780 --> 29:44.318
I had -- had an accident
a few years ago

29:44.533 --> 29:46.239
that kind of changed
things for me.

29:46.452 --> 29:47.862
You have some kind
of head injury?

29:48.079 --> 29:50.491
No, nothing like that.

29:50.706 --> 29:52.242
I'm just kind of
in a lot of pain,

29:53.084 --> 29:56.576
and, um, that can kind of c--
cloud my mind.

29:58.714 --> 29:59.965
Yeah.

30:02.843 --> 30:04.128
[sighs]

30:08.933 --> 30:09.888
What do you think?

30:11.602 --> 30:14.514
I think Melissa Parr is addicted
to painkillers.

30:15.189 --> 30:16.144
Yeah.

30:16.357 --> 30:18.643
That can be a pretty expensive
habit to feed.

30:19.235 --> 30:20.975
-Yeah.
-Maybe that's her motive.

30:21.904 --> 30:24.441
She kills Vincent
for his casino winnings.

30:26.200 --> 30:28.282
She seems really nervous
around me.

30:28.494 --> 30:30.450
-That could just be the pills.
-Maybe.

30:30.663 --> 30:33.655
Maybe if I wasn't around,
she'd open up more to you.

30:33.874 --> 30:35.080
It's worth a try.

30:36.168 --> 30:36.918
Yeah.

30:37.878 --> 30:40.164
Why not order a burger
from your own restaurant?

30:40.381 --> 30:42.042
And miss out on the best
burger in town?

30:42.258 --> 30:43.418
Why would I do that?

30:44.343 --> 30:46.049
So, have you
found out anything

30:46.262 --> 30:49.129
about Malachi laundering money
through the Red Pony?

30:49.348 --> 30:50.679
I am just delivering food.

30:50.891 --> 30:52.506
I do not know
what you are talking about.

30:52.727 --> 30:55.764
You think my office is bugged
and Malachi is listening in.

30:55.980 --> 30:58.187
Malachi, if you are listening,
Standing Bear and l

30:58.399 --> 30:59.684
are conspiring as we speak

30:59.900 --> 31:02.107
to uncover all
your criminal activities.

31:02.320 --> 31:03.230
You got that?

31:04.030 --> 31:05.566
If we're gonna work
together, Henry,

31:05.781 --> 31:08.443
we have to at least pretend
to trust each other.

31:08.659 --> 31:09.523
Fine.

31:10.661 --> 31:12.526
All I know is that there is
a lot more money

31:12.747 --> 31:15.705
flowing through the Red Pony --
new revenue streams, too.

31:16.584 --> 31:18.870
According to the ledger I found,
your casino is booking

31:19.086 --> 31:21.668
my catering services
several times a week.

31:21.881 --> 31:24.793
-Okay, that's news to me.
-Me too.

31:25.009 --> 31:27.876
So there must be a second ledger
with the real numbers

31:28.095 --> 31:29.346
and the real sources
of income.

31:29.555 --> 31:31.466
-l have not found it yet.
-Try harder.

31:32.183 --> 31:35.016
And when you find it,
keep an eye out for a company

31:35.227 --> 31:37.479
called Manifest Destinations.

31:37.688 --> 31:40.270
I think they're a front
for a criminal organization.

31:40.816 --> 31:42.807
-Already? The casino just opened.
-Oh, yeah.

31:43.027 --> 31:44.938
Everyone's trying to siphon
away the profits.

31:45.154 --> 31:46.860
Ah, yes.

31:47.073 --> 31:49.439
The profits that should be going
to the tribe.

31:50.701 --> 31:52.111
Is this about Cady?

31:52.370 --> 31:55.032
It has less to do with Cady
than about your priorities.

31:55.247 --> 31:58.239
My priorities are
the well-being of our people

31:58.459 --> 32:00.541
and the infrastructure
of our community.

32:00.753 --> 32:04.962
Schools, community centers,
access to legal aid.

32:05.174 --> 32:06.664
And the people themselves?

32:09.470 --> 32:11.802
Have you heard of
"refeeding syndrome"?

32:14.683 --> 32:17.891
It's when a starved body
can't process

32:18.104 --> 32:19.810
an excess of new food.

32:20.022 --> 32:22.479
The body shuts down --
dies, even.

32:23.234 --> 32:25.520
For centuries, our people have
been starved of prosperity

32:25.736 --> 32:27.146
and opportunity.

32:27.822 --> 32:29.437
You can't just open up
a buffet

32:29.657 --> 32:33.149
and expect a starving person
to make smart choices.

32:36.747 --> 32:41.411
You have to feed the starved
body a little at a time

32:41.627 --> 32:43.788
so that it can
get well again.

32:45.714 --> 32:48.922
So you are saving misguided
Indians from themselves.

32:49.802 --> 32:51.713
You sound like
the U.S. government.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.090
Did you find anything
under her vehicle?

32:58.519 --> 33:00.726
I'll show you.
Here.

33:00.938 --> 33:02.724
No marks, no mess.

33:04.024 --> 33:05.275
Nothing at all?
No blood?

33:05.484 --> 33:06.815
Nope, it's clean.

33:07.361 --> 33:09.317
Maybe I should look
under some other cars.

33:09.530 --> 33:11.486
I'm thinking Malachi's
and Darius'.

33:12.366 --> 33:14.106
-Thanks.
[Vic] Hey, Walt?

33:14.952 --> 33:16.908
-Yeah.
-You got a call.

33:17.121 --> 33:18.361
Donna call back?

33:18.873 --> 33:19.703
No.

33:19.915 --> 33:21.530
[rock music playing on radio]

33:21.750 --> 33:23.911
J‘J‘ Come on,
give me what you got J‘J‘

33:24.128 --> 33:26.369
J‘J‘ I'll even give you
the first shot J‘J‘

33:33.179 --> 33:34.294
"Little Big Man."

33:35.389 --> 33:37.675
Written, directed,
and starring whitey.

33:38.142 --> 33:40.303
In terms of white man
ass-kissing,

33:40.519 --> 33:41.929
I'd give it four stars.

33:42.146 --> 33:44.432
Is that why you called --
to give me a movie review?

33:44.648 --> 33:46.855
No, but I do have some film
for you to watch.

33:47.026 --> 33:50.018
So, uh, grab some popcorn.

33:53.491 --> 33:56.779
I got some footage of your guy
two nights ago.

33:56.994 --> 33:58.780
And, yes, he was winning big.

33:59.622 --> 34:01.328
And he was not alone.

34:01.540 --> 34:02.871
Was his wife there?

34:03.417 --> 34:06.250
I don't know.
Does his wife look like that?

34:06.879 --> 34:08.710
No.
Who is she?

34:09.381 --> 34:10.507
No idea.

34:11.675 --> 34:14.667
But I do know that Jacob didn't
want me to show you any of this.

34:14.887 --> 34:16.002
Why are you showing me this?

34:16.222 --> 34:17.678
Because, uh...

34:17.890 --> 34:21.098
l have a granddaughter,
same age as his daughter.

34:22.102 --> 34:24.889
I don't get to see her
very much, but, uh...

34:25.481 --> 34:27.267
...I'd do anything
for that little girl.

34:28.192 --> 34:30.183
We found a napkin
like the one in that video

34:30.402 --> 34:31.903
with 503 written on it.

34:32.613 --> 34:35.320
I need to see inside that room.
[chuckles]

34:36.367 --> 34:39.029
Walter, H can't exactly waltz
you through my boss's palace

34:39.245 --> 34:40.530
and escort you.

34:41.413 --> 34:43.278
But I can tell you that, uh,

34:43.958 --> 34:46.870
my guys take their lunch break
in about 40 minutes from now.

34:49.505 --> 34:51.041
You gonna go check out
that hotel room?

34:52.091 --> 34:53.331
Mm-hmm.

34:54.260 --> 34:55.215
Uh-huh.

34:56.845 --> 34:58.506
Yeah. No.
Nothing new here.

34:59.431 --> 35:00.807
I'll keep an eye on them.

35:04.061 --> 35:06.177
Is everything okay?
l-l must've caught a bug.

35:06.397 --> 35:07.887
I should go home.

35:08.107 --> 35:11.224
All right, um, stay here,
and I'll get you some tea.

35:11.443 --> 35:13.058
-I need to go home.
-|t's okay, Mom.

35:13.279 --> 35:15.611
Listen, we're gonna get you guys
out of here as soon as we can,

35:15.823 --> 35:17.279
but we still
haven't talked about

35:17.491 --> 35:19.777
who might have had a problem
with Vincent, okay?

35:20.202 --> 35:21.487
-All right.
-Hey.

35:21.704 --> 35:23.569
-Hi.
-I got Walt's message.

35:23.789 --> 35:24.699
You just missed him.

35:25.332 --> 35:26.037
Oh.

35:29.503 --> 35:32.620
Um, maybe you and I could speak
in Walt's office for a second.

35:33.591 --> 35:34.626
Sure.

35:35.759 --> 35:37.750
Uh, that woman is not okay.

35:39.346 --> 35:42.088
Clearly. She's going
through withdrawal.

35:42.308 --> 35:44.344
She was doped up when Walt
brought her in this morning.

35:44.560 --> 35:46.892
So then you called
Child Protective Services.

35:47.104 --> 35:48.389
So, when do they get here?

35:48.981 --> 35:51.267
-We haven't called them yet.
-That woman is in no condition

35:51.483 --> 35:53.019
to take care of her daughter,

35:53.235 --> 35:56.523
and Walt's message said that the
dad had been killed, so...

35:56.739 --> 35:58.946
I mean, what are we
waiting for here, huh?

35:59.158 --> 36:01.444
The child to suffer
irreversible trauma?

36:02.328 --> 36:04.614
The mother is a suspect
in the father's death.

36:04.830 --> 36:07.788
Yes. All the more
reason to call.

36:09.835 --> 36:10.870
Okay.

36:11.670 --> 36:12.625
Okay.

36:13.464 --> 36:14.624
Okay.

36:15.799 --> 36:16.709
[clears throat]

36:18.510 --> 36:22.753
If we can observe and talk to
her for a little while longer,

36:22.973 --> 36:26.511
we may be able to figure out how
and why the father was killed.

36:26.727 --> 36:30.185
In fact, Walt just left to
give them a chance to open up.

36:30.981 --> 36:33.188
You know, he knows that some
people wait for him to leave

36:33.400 --> 36:34.480
to start talking.

36:34.693 --> 36:39.107
Okay, why don't you just stop
with the subtle insinuations?

36:39.323 --> 36:40.938
You're actually not
very good at it,

36:41.158 --> 36:42.659
especially not
the subtle part.

36:42.868 --> 36:43.903
Okay.

36:45.871 --> 36:47.907
I find it rather coincidental
that you show up

36:48.123 --> 36:49.499
just minutes
after Walt leaves.

36:49.708 --> 36:51.039
Were you waiting outside
for him to go

36:51.251 --> 36:52.377
so you could barely miss him

36:52.586 --> 36:53.917
like you've been missing
his phone calls?

36:56.465 --> 36:58.126
All right, well, you know --
[clears throat]

37:05.849 --> 37:08.761
Walt hired you,
so he trusts you.

37:09.937 --> 37:11.768
So he must see qualities
in you

37:11.980 --> 37:13.971
that aren't obvious
to the naked eye.

37:14.733 --> 37:16.724
So I will give you
the benefit of the doubt

37:16.944 --> 37:18.104
and give you an answer.

37:19.405 --> 37:22.147
You see, I missed a little bit
of work recently.

37:22.366 --> 37:24.903
It's a long story -- you know,
kidnapping, gunshot wound.

37:25.119 --> 37:27.861
And so I have been working
overtime to make it up.

37:29.289 --> 37:31.029
Does that work for you?
Hmm?

37:31.583 --> 37:33.619
Or do you have
some follow-up questions

37:33.836 --> 37:36.168
concerning your boss's
private life?

37:38.799 --> 37:39.584
Thanks.

37:41.385 --> 37:43.501
You know,
for coming down to my level

37:43.721 --> 37:45.052
and granting me a response.

37:45.264 --> 37:47.129
But while we're on the topic
of not understanding

37:47.307 --> 37:50.515
what Walt sees in other people,
let me be unsubtle.

37:52.479 --> 37:54.470
l have no idea
what makes you worthy of him.

37:56.108 --> 37:57.439
I really don't.

37:57.651 --> 38:00.393
But I saw him go through hell
when your life was in danger.

38:01.363 --> 38:04.105
And so when he reaches out
to contact you,

38:05.159 --> 38:07.150
he deserves a response.

38:07.327 --> 38:08.908
He deserves more than that,
of course,

38:09.121 --> 38:11.362
but he sure as hell
doesn't deserve less.

38:11.582 --> 38:12.867
Not from you.

38:13.625 --> 38:15.001
Not from anyone.

38:17.463 --> 38:18.873
[Olivia]
Mom! Mom, no!

38:19.089 --> 38:21.580
[indistinct shouting]

38:21.800 --> 38:23.085
You can't leave!
I don't know what happened!

38:23.302 --> 38:25.384
Okay. Calm down.
Okay. Okay. All right.

38:25.596 --> 38:26.676
-I need to get home.
-I know. You're safe here.

38:26.889 --> 38:28.174
I'm very sick.
I need my medicine.

38:28.390 --> 38:30.506
I cannot release your daughter
into your custody

38:30.684 --> 38:31.969
when you are in
this state, all right?

38:32.186 --> 38:33.471
I'll just leave her here,
but I need to go home.

38:33.687 --> 38:35.143
You do not have a car,
Mrs. Parr.

38:35.355 --> 38:36.344
Okay, well,
then I'll call a cab!

38:36.565 --> 38:37.429
I got this.

38:38.400 --> 38:40.231
Please put the phone down,
all right?

38:41.236 --> 38:43.727
Don't look at me
like I'm a bad mom.

38:43.947 --> 38:45.528
I wouldn't say that.
That's not what I said, okay?

38:45.699 --> 38:48.691
You're not a bad mom --
Oh, God! Shit!

38:48.911 --> 38:50.026
[gaSpS]
Okay.

38:51.371 --> 38:52.577
-|'m sorry.
-No. Okay.

38:52.790 --> 38:54.576
-Okay. Okay. All right.
-|'m so sorry.

38:54.792 --> 38:56.157
Nope, nope.
It's fine.

38:56.376 --> 38:58.082
-All right. Okay.
-No! Please don't touch me!

38:58.295 --> 39:00.536
Aah! Aah!

39:01.799 --> 39:02.788
Okay.

39:28.700 --> 39:29.735
I'm sorry.

39:29.952 --> 39:32.318
I was told that this room
was unoccupied.

39:32.538 --> 39:34.119
Can I help you?

39:34.331 --> 39:36.322
Well, I'm Sheriff Longmire.

39:36.542 --> 39:38.954
Do you mind if I ask you
a few questions, Miss...

39:39.211 --> 39:41.953
Mrs., actually.
It's Mrs. Shawna Crawford.

39:42.881 --> 39:44.496
No. Come on in.

39:45.259 --> 39:46.419
Thank you.

39:46.635 --> 39:48.091
I have to go to work
in a few minutes,

39:48.303 --> 39:50.794
-so I don't have long to talk.
-What kind of work?

39:51.014 --> 39:54.131
I'm a travel agent for a company
called Manifest Destinations

39:54.351 --> 39:55.386
out of Massachusetts.

39:55.602 --> 39:56.978
I'm here touring the hotel,

39:57.187 --> 39:59.473
putting travel packages
together and such.

39:59.982 --> 40:01.222
So, what do you need?

40:02.526 --> 40:03.732
Do you know this man?

40:05.863 --> 40:07.103
Are you sure
you're the sheriff

40:07.322 --> 40:08.698
and not some P.l.
my husband hired?

40:09.741 --> 40:11.447
Pretty certain, yeah.

40:12.202 --> 40:14.534
Yeah, I recognize him.

40:14.746 --> 40:16.452
I saw him gambling
a few nights ago.

40:16.665 --> 40:19.077
He Iooked...safe.

40:19.293 --> 40:22.410
And I was a bit lonely
and a bit tipsy, to be honest.

40:23.338 --> 40:24.839
So we flirted
a little bit.

40:26.091 --> 40:28.002
I even wrote down
my room number,

40:28.218 --> 40:29.719
but I guess
he wasn't interested.

40:30.387 --> 40:31.752
And that was the last
I saw of him.

40:31.972 --> 40:33.337
I actually never even got
his name.

40:33.557 --> 40:34.546
What night was this?

40:35.434 --> 40:36.549
It was two nights ago.

40:37.352 --> 40:38.728
Did you see him last night?

40:38.937 --> 40:41.599
No, just the one night.
Why?

40:42.649 --> 40:45.026
Well, he was found dead
in my county this morning.

40:45.736 --> 40:46.942
He's dead?

40:48.155 --> 40:50.237
I'm trying to piece together
his last few days.

40:51.033 --> 40:53.570
Is there anything you could, uh,
tell me about your conversation?

40:53.785 --> 40:55.286
Um, wow.

40:56.872 --> 40:57.827
Uh, okay.

40:58.040 --> 40:59.826
Our conversation, um...

41:01.543 --> 41:03.704
Uh, well, he complimented me
on my vocabulary,

41:03.921 --> 41:05.161
which was a nice surprise.

41:05.964 --> 41:07.829
Um, and he said
he was on a lucky streak

41:08.050 --> 41:09.790
so he couldn't leave
the table.

41:10.010 --> 41:11.966
And I remember thinking
that if he did come to my room,

41:12.179 --> 41:15.342
I was setting myself up
for disappointment.

41:15.557 --> 41:16.546
How so?

41:17.225 --> 41:19.887
The more I talked to him,
I realized he was wasted.

41:20.479 --> 41:22.094
-Vincent was drunk?
-He masked it well.

41:22.314 --> 41:24.396
He wasn't slurring his words
or anything.

41:24.608 --> 41:27.441
But his eyes and breath
gave it away.

41:30.072 --> 41:31.437
[telephone ringing]

41:36.370 --> 41:37.530
You expecting a call?

41:38.246 --> 41:39.156
No.

41:40.165 --> 41:41.826
Well, you're getting one.

41:42.042 --> 41:42.827
Yeah.

41:43.877 --> 41:45.208
[ringing continues]

41:47.714 --> 41:50.171
Hello?
This is Shawna Crawford.

41:51.343 --> 41:53.129
Yes, this is room 503.

41:57.182 --> 41:58.592
It's for you.

42:00.185 --> 42:02.096
I'm at the hospital
with Melissa Parr.

42:02.813 --> 42:04.178
[Walt]
What happened?

42:05.107 --> 42:07.393
I think we might have just found
another motive.

42:09.611 --> 42:12.444
[indistinct talking on P.A.]

42:13.448 --> 42:14.198
Yeah, okay.

42:15.993 --> 42:17.449
Hey, I, uh,
I got your message,

42:17.661 --> 42:19.117
and you're absolutely right.

42:19.454 --> 42:20.409
Suspect or not,

42:20.622 --> 42:23.364
that girl's mother is in no
shape to take care of a child.

42:23.583 --> 42:26.074
So if -- if there isn't
any other available family,

42:26.294 --> 42:28.421
she's gonna have to be placed
with a social worker.

42:29.297 --> 42:30.628
-Thanks.
-Yeah, um...

42:32.175 --> 42:34.587
l-l got your other messages,
too.

42:34.803 --> 42:36.009
Yeah, uh...

42:37.055 --> 42:40.718
So, should I just mail your
blouse and other clothes to you?

42:40.934 --> 42:42.344
No, no.
I'll pick them up.

42:42.561 --> 42:43.676
Um...

42:43.895 --> 42:45.556
Look, Walt, I know that
we need to talk,

42:45.772 --> 42:49.014
but you're -- you're busy now,
so we'll just talk later.

42:49.401 --> 42:50.231
Okay?

42:50.861 --> 42:52.101
-Okay.
-All right.

43:00.829 --> 43:03.115
Melissa Parr is in
an exam room.

43:03.331 --> 43:05.993
-Where's Olivia?
-Ferg's keeping her distracted.

43:06.209 --> 43:08.200
We also got Vincent Parr's
blood tests back.

43:08.420 --> 43:09.910
Vincent was drunk
when he died.

43:10.130 --> 43:12.371
Twice the legal limit.
How did you know?

43:13.091 --> 43:15.503
Room 503.
So what's behind this door?

43:34.029 --> 43:34.939
What happened?

43:36.156 --> 43:40.069
lcouldn't...hide the truth
anymore.

43:41.620 --> 43:42.985
The truth about what?

43:47.626 --> 43:48.581
Vincent.

43:56.384 --> 43:57.544
It's okay.

44:24.204 --> 44:26.069
This is the fourth robbery
in six months by a bank robber

44:26.289 --> 44:30.032
authorities have taken
to calling Cowboy Bill.

44:30.252 --> 44:32.834
Witnesses describe this Cowboy
Bill as being a polite man...

44:33.046 --> 44:34.161
Do you have any jacks?

44:35.257 --> 44:36.212
Uh...

44:37.551 --> 44:38.586
Go fish.

44:38.802 --> 44:40.258
[reporter]
...pulling in $20,000.

44:40.470 --> 44:42.847
Hey, I'll be right back.
No peeking.

44:43.473 --> 44:45.509
Keep your eye out for
Cowboy Bill for me, all right?

44:47.227 --> 44:49.309
Walt wants me
to take Olivia.

44:50.814 --> 44:51.678
Where?

44:52.149 --> 44:55.562
Somewhere Children's Services
is less likely to show up.

44:58.613 --> 45:02.902
The first time Vincent hit me
was four years ago.

45:03.118 --> 45:06.610
I came here
asking for painkillers.

45:06.830 --> 45:11.415
l...l told the doctor
I'd been in a bicycle accident.

45:12.169 --> 45:13.375
What really happened?

45:14.212 --> 45:16.749
Well, we had gone
to a holiday party

45:16.965 --> 45:19.206
for the high school staff.

45:19.968 --> 45:21.833
I drank too much wine.

45:22.637 --> 45:25.970
And I bumped into
the vice principal,

45:26.183 --> 45:28.299
and I caused her to spill
something.

45:30.562 --> 45:32.644
It's not that huge
of a deal.

45:34.649 --> 45:35.684
Right?

45:40.030 --> 45:44.694
When we got home,
Vincent... completely lost it.

45:44.910 --> 45:47.743
And I ended up
with a broken collarbone.

45:49.080 --> 45:50.991
Had he ever hit you before?

45:51.208 --> 45:53.574
No. He changed after he got
that job.

45:54.961 --> 45:58.374
-Why?
-I think it was
because of his father.

45:59.424 --> 46:03.292
When Vincent was growing up,
his dad drank himself

46:03.511 --> 46:05.763
right out of a job
and their family...

46:07.015 --> 46:08.676
...right out of their house.

46:08.892 --> 46:12.225
So Vincent was not gonna
let that happen.

46:12.437 --> 46:16.100
So, no matter how much he drank,
he always wanted to, you know,

46:16.316 --> 46:19.149
have the appearance
of an upstanding family man

46:19.361 --> 46:21.101
and a good provider.

46:21.321 --> 46:23.482
And he would just lose it

46:23.698 --> 46:25.859
when he thought I was
jeopardizing that.

46:28.411 --> 46:30.322
Did Vincent hit Olivia
as well?

46:30.872 --> 46:31.827
No.

46:32.791 --> 46:36.409
No, if he ever would've
laid a hand on our baby girl,

46:36.628 --> 46:37.913
I would have gotten her
out of there.

46:38.129 --> 46:39.380
I would've done
the right thing.

46:39.589 --> 46:41.705
Is that why you went out
driving last night?

46:42.300 --> 46:43.836
To do the right thing?

46:44.052 --> 46:47.465
When Vincent and Olivia
didn't come home, I got scared.

46:47.681 --> 46:50.639
I knew Vincent was lying
about where he was.

46:52.102 --> 46:53.683
You knew
he was at the casino?

46:53.895 --> 46:55.135
I knew he'd been drinking,

46:55.355 --> 46:57.311
'cause I could hear it
in his voice.

46:57.524 --> 46:59.139
Probably the Rusty Lantern.

46:59.901 --> 47:02.643
Did Vincent often take
your 10-year-old with him

47:02.821 --> 47:04.106
when he'd go drinking?

47:08.827 --> 47:11.443
He said leaving her in
the car was safer

47:11.663 --> 47:13.619
than leaving her with
me because...

47:16.251 --> 47:19.994
...l was an unfit mother.

47:21.047 --> 47:25.461
But when he called drunk and
then they didn't come home...

47:26.928 --> 47:28.088
...I didn't care.

47:28.722 --> 47:30.678
I knew I shouldn't
be driving, but...

47:32.892 --> 47:36.976
All I could think about
was Olivia in some wreck.

47:39.649 --> 47:41.230
[crying]
It's been a nightmare.

47:42.610 --> 47:47.195
Did you run your husband over
to end that nightmare?

47:48.450 --> 47:50.532
[breathes deeply]

47:52.912 --> 47:55.198
I don't know what I did
last night.

48:09.137 --> 48:10.217
[knock on door]

48:14.225 --> 48:15.351
Come in.

48:17.562 --> 48:19.268
Did we have a meeting
scheduled?

48:19.481 --> 48:20.641
N-No, no.

48:20.857 --> 48:22.597
I was just coming to tell you
that I found

48:22.817 --> 48:24.478
some decent office space
on the res.

48:25.111 --> 48:28.148
I mean, it's gonna need a lot of
work before it can open, but...

48:29.741 --> 48:33.199
l have a good
handyman for you.

48:33.411 --> 48:38.576
A gentleman
named Sam Poteet.

48:38.792 --> 48:40.999
Actually, I can take care
of the repairs myself.

48:41.211 --> 48:42.792
But it was your idea
to visibly demonstrate

48:42.962 --> 48:45.214
how the money's being
reinvested on the res.

48:45.924 --> 48:48.415
Don't you think hiring a member
of the tribe will help with that?

48:48.635 --> 48:50.091
Not if it's a waste
of money.

48:58.061 --> 48:59.847
Mr. Poteet...

49:02.315 --> 49:04.977
...is both
highly dependable...

49:07.445 --> 49:10.027
...and highly efficient.

49:15.120 --> 49:16.656
Are you threatening me?

49:17.914 --> 49:21.122
In Cheyenne culture,
the most prized dowry

49:21.292 --> 49:24.580
a groom can offer his
new bride's father is a rifle.

49:25.922 --> 49:27.787
There's a reason
for this tradition.

49:29.134 --> 49:30.169
Do you know what it is?

49:30.552 --> 49:32.793
No, clearly.

49:33.012 --> 49:37.096
The idea is that you never arm
your enemy.

49:39.185 --> 49:42.473
You're making a deep
and, dare I say,

49:42.689 --> 49:46.352
courageous commitment
to this tribe.

49:46.568 --> 49:49.901
The rifle is a symbol
of my trust.

49:52.824 --> 49:54.064
Take it.

49:59.372 --> 50:00.361
Thank you.

50:03.543 --> 50:07.832
And for those times
when symbols don't suffice...

50:09.841 --> 50:11.297
...you should have these
as well.

50:20.310 --> 50:21.265
[horn honks]

50:26.191 --> 50:27.101
Hey.

50:27.942 --> 50:29.773
Bartender confirms
that Vincent was in here

50:29.986 --> 50:31.101
for about an hour last night.

50:31.321 --> 50:32.902
He had four beers
and four shots.

50:33.072 --> 50:35.984
Eight drinks in an hour?
Jesus.

50:36.201 --> 50:38.408
Cashier at the minimart said
that Olivia did come in there.

50:38.620 --> 50:40.235
She got a sandwich
and some Skittles,

50:40.455 --> 50:43.242
and she crossed back to over
and got into a royal blue sedan.

50:46.044 --> 50:49.002
So, Vincent Parr leaves the
Rusty Lantern around 9:00 pm.

50:49.214 --> 50:51.546
It's a 30-minute drive
from there to the casino,

50:51.758 --> 50:53.749
and he's seen entering
the casino around 9:30,

50:53.968 --> 50:55.299
leaving Olivia in the car.

50:55.512 --> 50:57.628
Then he isn't seen again
until the kid finds him here,

50:58.056 --> 50:59.921
20 miles from the casino.

51:07.857 --> 51:10.189
So, if Melissa killed Vincent,
how'd she get his body

51:10.401 --> 51:12.141
from the casino
all the way out there?

51:12.946 --> 51:15.358
She said she didn't even know
that he was at the casino.

51:15.573 --> 51:18.360
So she's lying
orjust confused.

51:19.911 --> 51:21.993
Let's take Malachi at his word
that Vincent Parr

51:22.205 --> 51:24.537
never made it
inside the casino last night.

51:32.090 --> 51:33.455
[sighs]

51:36.177 --> 51:38.554
So that would mean
whatever happened...

51:39.931 --> 51:40.920
happened out here.

51:53.528 --> 51:55.234
From here,
you can see everything.

51:58.116 --> 52:00.949
Is this where Olivia was sitting
when Cady found her?

52:03.496 --> 52:04.485
It is.

52:05.748 --> 52:07.784
So, then if Melissa
picked up Vincent,

52:08.001 --> 52:09.866
or Malachi's guys
mugged him...

52:12.213 --> 52:13.544
His daughter saw it.

52:20.930 --> 52:22.670
I need to go talk
to Olivia.

52:31.065 --> 52:33.852
Probably should get Vincent's
car back to the family.

52:34.068 --> 52:35.933
Do you have the keys?
I can drive it over there.

52:40.283 --> 52:42.023
I think we need to call
a tow truck.

53:01.137 --> 53:02.172
Thanks, Ferg.

53:05.016 --> 53:06.131
How are you feeling?

53:06.351 --> 53:07.591
Terrible.

53:08.936 --> 53:11.643
But they gave me some Pedialyte,
which is helping.

53:16.235 --> 53:17.441
Where's Olivia?

53:17.654 --> 53:19.394
She's here.
She's in good hands.

53:21.491 --> 53:23.732
I'm afraid to even
ask this, but...

53:25.161 --> 53:27.277
...but what did you find out
about last night?

53:28.623 --> 53:30.409
Whatever happened to Vincent,

53:30.625 --> 53:33.833
I think your daughter saw it
and she's afraid to talk.

53:36.172 --> 53:37.753
Because she saw me?

53:40.009 --> 53:41.340
I don't know yet.

53:47.850 --> 53:50.683
Dad picked me up from school,
and we went to get dinner.

53:50.895 --> 53:52.180
Where?

53:52.397 --> 53:53.603
The gas station.

53:54.774 --> 53:56.856
I got a sandwich
and some Skittles.

53:57.068 --> 53:58.399
I ate in the car.

53:59.904 --> 54:01.235
Outside the bar?

54:02.490 --> 54:03.525
Yeah.

54:04.158 --> 54:06.365
I waited while Dad went inside.

54:06.577 --> 54:07.828
Then we drove to the casino.

54:08.037 --> 54:09.868
What happened when you got
to the casino?

54:10.832 --> 54:13.164
Dad went inside, like I said.

54:13.376 --> 54:14.456
And that's the truth?

54:16.295 --> 54:21.255
Olivia, darling, you need
to tell the sheriff the truth.

54:21.926 --> 54:24.668
Even if it puts me
in a bad light,

54:25.388 --> 54:28.425
you need to tell him what
happened, no matter what I did.

54:30.393 --> 54:32.850
The sheriff already knows
that Dad hit me.

54:34.689 --> 54:37.055
When your dad went
into the casino last night,

54:37.275 --> 54:38.890
did anybody stop him?

54:41.779 --> 54:43.019
I got some photos.

54:50.496 --> 54:51.747
Was it this man?

54:54.917 --> 54:55.781
No?

54:58.755 --> 54:59.915
How about this one?

55:01.466 --> 55:02.546
From the other night.

55:06.471 --> 55:07.381
Okay.

55:08.765 --> 55:11.427
Olivia, um,
did you see your mother

55:11.642 --> 55:13.803
outside the casino
last night?

55:17.356 --> 55:18.766
It's okay.

55:20.234 --> 55:22.611
We're gonna tell the truth now,
no matter what.

55:23.821 --> 55:25.027
No more secrets.

55:30.578 --> 55:31.328
No.

55:33.873 --> 55:35.829
Mom wasn't at the casino
last night.

55:37.168 --> 55:37.918
Okay.

55:39.462 --> 55:41.953
So who did you see
with your dad?

55:46.135 --> 55:48.217
You didn't see anybody,
did you?

55:49.931 --> 55:52.388
Because your dad was never
at the casino last night.

55:54.185 --> 55:55.675
What are you
talking about?

55:55.895 --> 55:59.308
Olivia, could you empty out
your pockets for me?

56:08.199 --> 56:10.815
Everything, please.

56:31.848 --> 56:35.841
I found these
on the driver's-side floor.

56:38.062 --> 56:40.394
I never found
your dad's car keys.

56:40.606 --> 56:44.019
That's because he gave them
to you, isn't it?

56:46.487 --> 56:48.398
You were your dad's
designated driver.

56:48.698 --> 56:51.314
No, but OI-- Olivia can't drive.

56:51.534 --> 56:52.569
She's 10.

56:52.785 --> 56:54.116
Dad taught me.

56:58.124 --> 57:00.536
So he wouldn't get a DUI and
lose his job.

57:01.752 --> 57:06.746
But if you drove him
to the casino...

57:08.175 --> 57:10.507
...how'd they find his body
out by the bar?

57:10.720 --> 57:16.135
Because Olivia didn't drive
Vincent to the casino.

57:16.601 --> 57:18.557
He was never there
last night.

57:19.353 --> 57:21.389
There's no footage of him
on the inside.

57:21.606 --> 57:25.315
And if he'd been stopped outside
by you or anyone,

57:25.526 --> 57:27.266
somebody would've seen it.

57:30.114 --> 57:33.698
Olivia, what happened
to your dad

57:33.910 --> 57:37.243
on the drive between the bar
and the casino?

57:40.541 --> 57:41.997
One of my dreams happened.

57:44.211 --> 57:45.462
What?

57:45.671 --> 57:48.959
I used to dream about somebody
coming to rescue us.

57:51.886 --> 57:53.922
So that you could go
to the doctor and get better.

57:56.766 --> 57:59.428
I dreamed up all the ways
that Dad could disappear.

58:01.520 --> 58:03.897
And one of your dreams
turned real last night?

58:07.234 --> 58:09.486
[Olivia]
When I was driving from the bar,

58:09.695 --> 58:11.981
Dad called Mom to say
we were coming home.

58:13.532 --> 58:16.569
Then he fell asleep
with his head against the door.

58:18.245 --> 58:19.075
It was dark.

58:19.497 --> 58:21.158
There wasn't anyone else
on the road.

58:22.083 --> 58:26.042
So I pulled the car over,
put the handle in "P"

58:26.253 --> 58:27.834
like Dad showed me,

58:28.047 --> 58:31.380
and I came around
and opened his door.

58:32.843 --> 58:35.129
Dad fell out without waking up.

58:38.099 --> 58:40.511
So I closed the door,
got back inside.

58:42.478 --> 58:44.309
Then I put the handle in "R."

58:46.357 --> 58:48.769
And the car went backward
over him.

58:52.613 --> 58:54.149
Then I put it in "D"..

58:56.534 --> 59:01.244
...and drove to the casino and
waited for someone to see me.

59:03.124 --> 59:05.490
[Melissa crying]

59:07.336 --> 59:08.416
Mom.

59:10.339 --> 59:11.249
Don't be sad.

59:11.465 --> 59:13.046
Dad's gone now.

59:14.343 --> 59:17.335
You can go to the doctor
and get better.

59:21.600 --> 59:23.511
It's all gonna be okay.

59:26.272 --> 59:28.763
[sobs]

59:43.956 --> 59:45.196
[knock on door]

59:49.378 --> 59:50.879
[sighs]

59:53.090 --> 59:54.876
Oh, good.
You're, uh -- you're still up.

59:55.092 --> 59:57.583
Yeah, I was just puttering
around the house.

59:57.803 --> 59:58.918
-Come in.
-Oh, yeah.

1:00:04.810 --> 1:00:05.720
Uh...

1:00:06.812 --> 1:00:08.097
This is for you.

1:00:08.314 --> 1:00:09.429
Oh.

1:00:09.648 --> 1:00:11.058
Is it a gift?

1:00:11.776 --> 1:00:15.064
-It's laundry.
-Ah. Every girl's dream.

1:00:15.279 --> 1:00:17.611
Yeah.
Uh, I'll get you beer.

1:00:18.324 --> 1:00:19.359
Yeah.

1:00:20.951 --> 1:00:26.036
So, uh, I finally called
Children's Services.

1:00:26.248 --> 1:00:29.365
So does that mean that the
mother killed the girl's father?

1:00:29.585 --> 1:00:32.873
No, it was the girl actually,
to protect the mother.

1:00:33.589 --> 1:00:36.001
She'll be evaluated
and go into counseling,

1:00:36.217 --> 1:00:38.549
um, while the mom
rehabilitates, but...

1:00:39.762 --> 1:00:40.877
...she won't be charged.

1:00:41.097 --> 1:00:42.507
-She's too young.
-Yeah.

1:00:43.140 --> 1:00:46.177
Yeah.
This world will surprise you.

1:00:48.395 --> 1:00:49.145
Yep.

1:00:55.194 --> 1:00:56.604
I'm pregnant.

1:00:59.115 --> 1:01:00.150
Pregnant?

1:01:02.243 --> 1:01:04.734
-Aren't you a little, um --
-Be really careful.

1:01:05.871 --> 1:01:08.783
Aren't we both a little...
autumnal for that?

1:01:08.999 --> 1:01:11.490
Well...surprise.

1:01:11.710 --> 1:01:12.790
Yeah.

1:01:14.130 --> 1:01:16.667
I guess we should
make it official.

1:01:17.299 --> 1:01:19.255
-And get married?
-lt's the right thing to do.

1:01:19.468 --> 1:01:21.299
There's -- There's room here,
plenty of space --

1:01:21.512 --> 1:01:24.595
For God sakes, Walt,
I am not pregnant.

1:01:24.807 --> 1:01:26.638
But you just said
that you were pregnant.

1:01:26.851 --> 1:01:27.806
No, I know what I said.

1:01:28.018 --> 1:01:29.929
ls--
I said it to make a point.

1:01:30.146 --> 1:01:31.727
That you're a very
convincing liar?

1:01:31.939 --> 1:01:34.601
No, to make that point
that if I were pregnant,

1:01:34.817 --> 1:01:36.478
you would be
the sort of guy

1:01:36.694 --> 1:01:38.650
who would just immediately
ask me to marry him, you know?

1:01:38.863 --> 1:01:40.478
Even though --
Even though that's --

1:01:40.698 --> 1:01:41.813
that's not what you want.

1:01:42.032 --> 1:01:44.614
-I never said that.
-You don't have to.

1:01:48.122 --> 1:01:49.532
Look, I know you like me.

1:01:50.374 --> 1:01:53.081
And I like you --
a lot, actually.

1:01:54.461 --> 1:01:56.247
But what I don't want
is for you to feel obligated

1:01:56.463 --> 1:01:57.873
to be in a relationship
with me

1:01:58.090 --> 1:02:00.126
because now, suddenly,
after the attack, you know,

1:02:00.342 --> 1:02:01.843
it's "the right
thing to do," okay?

1:02:02.052 --> 1:02:05.010
I just -- I don't feel like pity
and obligation

1:02:05.222 --> 1:02:08.464
are ideal foundations
for a romance, so...

1:02:09.226 --> 1:02:10.056
All right.

1:02:11.937 --> 1:02:13.473
How about clean laundry...

1:02:14.815 --> 1:02:19.184
...and uh, an enduring
perplexity about existence?

1:02:20.738 --> 1:02:25.107
Well, I guess there are some
romances built on worse, right?

1:02:25.326 --> 1:02:26.406
Yeah.

1:02:27.494 --> 1:02:29.030
You want to sit?

1:02:30.247 --> 1:02:31.282
Yeah.

1:02:35.085 --> 1:02:36.825
[down-tempo music playing]

1:02:37.046 --> 1:02:38.627
[both sigh]

1:02:41.634 --> 1:02:43.124
Speaking of perplexity,

1:02:43.344 --> 1:02:46.552
do you actually know
how a woman gets pregnant?

1:02:49.141 --> 1:02:50.722
Well, um...

1:02:52.228 --> 1:02:54.594
I think I may have read
about that somewhere.

1:02:54.813 --> 1:02:57.896
So, why would you think
that I was, you know...

1:02:58.108 --> 1:02:59.359
What do you mean?

1:03:00.778 --> 1:03:02.234
Didn't we, um...

1:03:04.156 --> 1:03:05.487
You don't remember?

1:03:06.867 --> 1:03:08.323
I got hit in the head.

1:03:14.166 --> 1:03:15.531
So did we?

1:03:21.131 --> 1:03:22.166
Well...

1:03:23.425 --> 1:03:27.088
I guess every great romance
deserves a little mystery.

1:03:33.560 --> 1:03:35.096
[laughs]

1:03:35.312 --> 1:03:38.896
[music continues]
