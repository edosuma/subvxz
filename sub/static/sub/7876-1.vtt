00:33.362 --> 00:34.309
I'm mobile!

00:34.434 --> 00:36.357
Check me out, I'm mobile!

00:36.802 --> 00:40.597
Roger, look what I bought.
It's a hamster ball but I modified it.

00:42.080 --> 00:43.083
That's a thing.

00:43.275 --> 00:45.656
Look at them down there,
planning my birthday party.

00:45.781 --> 00:48.073
Yep, I'm turning 1600.

00:48.668 --> 00:50.974
A big 1, 6, double bagel.

00:51.452 --> 00:52.816
I like spying.

00:53.366 --> 00:55.864
My fanny is so high in the air
right now.

00:56.429 --> 00:58.464
Hi, I'd like to rent a bouncy castle

00:58.589 --> 01:01.184
and a sober clown
for my friend Roger this Saturday.

01:01.718 --> 01:04.777
Do you the number of someone
who does have a sober clown?

01:05.934 --> 01:08.733
No, sir. I don't believe
I am asking for the moon.

01:08.903 --> 01:11.580
Making a cake, ordering clowns...
They love me!

01:11.788 --> 01:15.671
Yep, in my culture, 1600
is the most important birthday of all.

01:15.796 --> 01:18.202
- And mine's shaping up pretty...
- Coming through!

01:20.757 --> 01:22.829
Behold! It is here!

01:22.954 --> 01:24.457
My first pube!

01:28.082 --> 01:29.254
It's red!

01:29.675 --> 01:31.073
Fire!

01:31.300 --> 01:32.680
God, I'm gonna be sick.

01:32.805 --> 01:34.801
I've finally hit puberty!

01:36.052 --> 01:38.033
Honey, that's wonderful.

01:38.158 --> 01:40.318
We're so... happy for you.

01:40.443 --> 01:42.767
Yes, very happy. Now go ahead
and pull up your pants.

01:43.315 --> 01:44.381
No chance.

01:44.506 --> 01:47.000
I gotta go brush and style
this bad boy.

01:50.066 --> 01:53.195
Okay, freak show's over.
Let's get back to my birthday.

01:53.651 --> 01:55.572
Where are you guys going?
Come back.

01:55.896 --> 01:57.693
Francine, the frosting!

01:58.687 --> 02:00.624
Hello, clown dispatcher?

02:01.389 --> 02:02.396
Oh, man.

02:02.824 --> 02:05.331
This is bad.
I can't deal with this.

02:18.618 --> 02:20.847
- Puberty.
- Our worst nightmare.

02:21.149 --> 02:23.954
The only thing worse
than a child going through puberty

02:24.079 --> 02:26.686
is being the parent
of a child going through puberty.

02:26.955 --> 02:29.697
Remember I had that bumper sticker
on the car for a while?

02:29.933 --> 02:31.243
Nobody honked.

02:32.471 --> 02:35.004
- What are you doing?
- I can't do it again, man.

02:35.129 --> 02:36.946
I'm leaving. I'm going to...

02:37.071 --> 02:39.449
I don't know, my mom's,
my sister's...

02:39.619 --> 02:41.984
Hell! I'll even go back to prison,
I don't care.

02:42.109 --> 02:43.810
Look, maybe it won't be so bad.

02:43.935 --> 02:46.165
- We got through Hayley's puberty.
- Barely.

02:46.607 --> 02:48.789
What do you mean, every month?

02:48.914 --> 02:52.031
Honey, that's the glory
of being a woman.

02:52.156 --> 02:54.938
I'm not using these!
I'm never using these!

02:57.804 --> 02:59.766
This is as big as they're gonna get?

03:02.225 --> 03:03.306
I'm hideous.

03:03.737 --> 03:06.860
- Honey, you can't even see it.
- It's pretty.

03:07.403 --> 03:09.822
Your cheek's pregnant.
Who's the father?

03:09.947 --> 03:12.649
Touching your face all day
with your greasy hands?

03:18.029 --> 03:19.277
Here's what I'm gonna do.

03:19.402 --> 03:22.277
I'm gonna wear my big shoes
and pack my flip flops.

03:22.402 --> 03:25.104
I'm not ready for Steve
to make the change.

03:25.331 --> 03:26.954
He's gonna have man breath

03:27.079 --> 03:29.732
and his poops won't
smell good anymore.

03:30.143 --> 03:34.131
I wish he could just stay 14
a little while longer.

03:34.424 --> 03:35.229
Not me.

03:35.354 --> 03:37.823
I want him to skip over puberty
and jump right to 21

03:37.954 --> 03:40.176
so the two of us can go have
a shot and a shave.

03:40.438 --> 03:43.533
We can finally sit down
and discuss <i>Ordinary People</i>.

03:43.778 --> 03:45.608
Tired of talking to the kid
about that movie

03:45.733 --> 03:47.500
and just getting a blank stare.

03:48.924 --> 03:50.285
Hey, rental units.

03:50.410 --> 03:52.664
I cleaned all the kid crap
from my room.

03:52.789 --> 03:55.358
I'm gonna dump it, then go for a jog.
You know, clear my head.

03:55.640 --> 03:57.507
It's a little chilly out,
wear a sweater.

03:58.181 --> 04:00.780
You're my mother,
not my thermometer.

04:05.183 --> 04:06.953
We have to do something.

04:07.123 --> 04:09.792
There's nothing we can do.
We're helpless.

04:09.917 --> 04:12.207
Like a turned-over tortoise
in the sun.

04:12.332 --> 04:15.450
Sure, our bellies are warm now,
but soon it will be dark.

04:15.989 --> 04:18.082
And then, the crows will come.

04:22.956 --> 04:25.598
Fellows,
how's the sloppy joes today?

04:25.723 --> 04:27.032
Sloppy, I trust.

04:28.172 --> 04:29.762
Are those khakis?

04:29.887 --> 04:31.618
A braided belt?

04:31.900 --> 04:33.257
Don't itemize, boys.

04:33.382 --> 04:35.625
Take it all in, it's a package.

04:35.750 --> 04:39.100
Speaking of packages,
mine's got a hair on it.

04:40.321 --> 04:42.071
Way to go, Steve!

04:45.835 --> 04:47.615
Sit down and tell us all about it.

04:47.740 --> 04:50.980
I'd love to, kimosabes,
but I'm here on business.

04:53.150 --> 04:55.752
Lisa Silver,
as I live and breathe...

04:55.922 --> 04:57.575
What do you want, tweeb?

04:58.011 --> 05:00.378
It's not what I want.
It's what you want.

05:00.503 --> 05:02.927
Which is to go to the dance
with me this Saturday.

05:03.052 --> 05:05.779
- I don't...
- I know you're into me.

05:06.001 --> 05:08.264
And if you weren't before,
you are now,

05:08.515 --> 05:10.825
because you're intrigued
by this moment.

05:11.747 --> 05:12.573
Go on.

05:12.698 --> 05:14.820
Meet me at Macy's tomorrow,
Young petite.

05:14.945 --> 05:16.408
We're going dress-shopping.

05:17.235 --> 05:19.404
I've got a look in mind for you.

05:20.492 --> 05:22.353
And I got you a present.

05:22.861 --> 05:25.448
It's getting to watch me walk away.

05:37.685 --> 05:40.880
- Hey, scientists.
- Hey, Mrs. Smith. What brings you by?

05:41.050 --> 05:43.512
Well, I was talking to Stan
last night.

05:43.637 --> 05:47.496
And he seemed pretty sure that nothing
could stop the ageing process.

05:47.731 --> 05:50.867
But I think if anyone in the world
could do it,

05:50.992 --> 05:53.772
it'd be you boys...
So smart!

05:53.897 --> 05:57.411
We have been goofing around
with this, but it's classified.

05:59.436 --> 06:01.006
Still classified?

06:07.047 --> 06:08.831
Still classified?

06:11.179 --> 06:13.512
- I've brought brownies.
- Brownies!

06:27.669 --> 06:29.955
He makes it difficult to negotiate.

06:33.537 --> 06:34.835
What an angel.

06:34.995 --> 06:37.854
God took a little extra time on you,
didn't he?

06:39.452 --> 06:41.266
My little deep-sleeper.

07:01.803 --> 07:04.464
What's this?
The Home & Hearth catalog?

07:05.490 --> 07:08.350
What a great place to shop
for birthday presents!

07:08.475 --> 07:09.412
Is that...

07:09.537 --> 07:12.223
Is that a nightstand
from the Country Mystique collection?

07:12.348 --> 07:13.724
What the hell happened to me?

07:15.394 --> 07:17.143
I'm a goddamn toddler!

07:18.174 --> 07:21.650
Moving on! There is a choice
between brass and wood drawer pulls.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.239
If you get the wood ones,
I'll throw everything in the street.

07:24.364 --> 07:25.671
Do not test me.

07:30.374 --> 07:32.192
Which one of you did this to me?

07:32.317 --> 07:34.606
I just asked
those scientists at the CIA

07:34.731 --> 07:36.774
for something to stop you
from ageing.

07:36.899 --> 07:39.986
- They must've given me too much.
- Francine, how could you?

07:40.111 --> 07:43.408
I just wanted him to stay 14
for a few more years,

07:43.533 --> 07:45.878
so I could hold on to my baby.

07:46.003 --> 07:47.340
I'm a baby all right!

07:47.579 --> 07:48.804
Look! It's gone!

07:48.929 --> 07:50.718
My one man hair is gone!

07:50.888 --> 07:52.717
Can we have one family meal

07:52.842 --> 07:55.126
without someone
flashing their genitalia?

07:55.450 --> 07:57.212
That is weird stuff.

07:57.337 --> 08:00.059
And we are certainly going
to talk about it after my party.

08:00.184 --> 08:01.908
Maybe while we're cleaning up.

08:03.401 --> 08:05.106
Maybe while you're cleaning up.

08:05.821 --> 08:08.402
- You are so cute!
- I'm not supposed to be cute!

08:08.595 --> 08:09.925
I'm supposed to be a man!

08:10.050 --> 08:12.035
You really gave it to me
this time, Mom!

08:12.160 --> 08:14.782
You just took a nightstick
and went...

08:17.823 --> 08:19.372
It was a total violation of my...

08:19.542 --> 08:21.374
- Steve, cartoons.
- Of my...

08:22.396 --> 08:24.808
Is that monkey working
as a greengrocer?

08:26.065 --> 08:28.664
Francine, you had no right
to turn Steve 5.

08:29.453 --> 08:32.475
I'm gonna pay the boys in the lab
a visit and get the antidote.

08:34.465 --> 08:37.000
I'm gonna need something
to grease the little one with.

08:37.125 --> 08:38.808
Where is he going?
That's my cake!

08:40.489 --> 08:41.864
This is all your fault.

08:41.989 --> 08:43.442
They should be at the mall,

08:43.567 --> 08:45.616
buying me
a tiny remote control helicopter

08:45.741 --> 08:48.009
- that'll break the moment I use it!
- Oh, my God!

08:48.134 --> 08:51.056
I was supposed to meet Lisa at the mall
to buy her a dress for the dance.

08:51.181 --> 08:53.902
I can't stand her up.
She's the hottest girl in school!

08:54.027 --> 08:55.943
This is my shot!
What am I gonna do?

08:56.068 --> 08:58.109
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

08:58.234 --> 09:00.322
I'm gonna bite those little legs!

09:03.214 --> 09:04.109
No, stop!

09:04.784 --> 09:08.062
Who's gonna eat the cob?
Mummy's gonna eat the cob!

09:13.612 --> 09:14.919
Look at me!

09:15.044 --> 09:18.714
Being escorted around town
by this handsome little gentleman!

09:18.839 --> 09:20.819
Just so you know,
I'm speaking calmly,

09:20.944 --> 09:24.145
but there is a tantrum brewing in me,
like this mall has never seen.

09:25.272 --> 09:28.113
- You want me to come with you?
- No, you've done enough.

09:32.269 --> 09:33.549
Press 4, please.

09:34.919 --> 09:36.409
I said 4!

09:36.638 --> 09:38.226
I'm sorry, I hit 3.

09:38.351 --> 09:39.549
I know, I saw.

09:40.980 --> 09:42.659
You've got stringbean legs.

09:42.784 --> 09:45.000
I want to bite them,
I want to bite them!

10:03.203 --> 10:04.209
Hey, babe.

10:05.355 --> 10:06.395
Down here.

10:07.134 --> 10:08.682
It's me, Steve Smith.

10:08.807 --> 10:10.983
- Is this a joke?
- I know this is weird.

10:11.153 --> 10:14.004
Since we last met,
I had a little pituitary problem,

10:14.129 --> 10:16.728
but don't worry.
You and me, that's still happening.

10:16.853 --> 10:18.926
So, I'm thinking open-toed shoes.

10:19.051 --> 10:21.869
You got good feet?
Pop off those kicks, give Daddy a look.

10:22.078 --> 10:24.965
I don't know what's going on,
if you're Steve's nephew or whatever,

10:25.090 --> 10:26.810
but when you see him, do me a favor.

10:26.935 --> 10:28.383
Tell him he blew it.

10:29.307 --> 10:30.829
It's me, I swear!

10:35.172 --> 10:38.085
Don't worry, kiddo.
This is gonna fix you right up.

10:46.703 --> 10:48.564
You had to give him that shot!

10:48.689 --> 10:51.985
You couldn't just let him be my baby
for a little while longer!

10:52.110 --> 10:54.685
No, Francine.
That time of his life is over.

10:55.490 --> 10:58.555
I guess we'll just have
to prepare ourselves for puberty.

10:59.318 --> 11:02.743
This will have to do till I can fashion
a shive out of a chicken bone.

11:03.064 --> 11:05.437
Puberty?
Not what I'm doing.

11:05.562 --> 11:07.915
When he gets up from his nap,
he's gonna be 21.

11:08.213 --> 11:09.047
What?

11:10.380 --> 11:11.420
What did you do?

11:11.589 --> 11:14.540
I had the boys at the lab give
me enough serum to drop Steve off

11:14.665 --> 11:16.459
just on the other side of puberty.

11:16.584 --> 11:19.170
Mary Tyler Moore is
such an icy bitch in this,

11:19.295 --> 11:21.827
- it's fantastic.
- Stan, we never discussed...

11:22.016 --> 11:24.223
There he is... My man's awake!

11:25.819 --> 11:26.809
Why?

11:26.979 --> 11:28.565
Oh, my God.

11:30.184 --> 11:32.315
I think the boys in the lab
made a mistake.

11:32.485 --> 11:33.451
You think?

11:33.576 --> 11:36.495
I got my pubic hair back.
A whole bunch of them.

11:36.620 --> 11:38.601
They're white as freaking Christmas.

11:38.726 --> 11:42.334
It's like Santa-town down there.
And look at my pendulous nuts.

11:42.459 --> 11:45.202
Every time I walk,
it's like a game of ganipganop.

11:46.228 --> 11:48.457
You rat bastards!
You sons of...

11:48.582 --> 11:51.289
- Weather channel.
- I'm not interested in...

11:51.980 --> 11:54.253
Looks like a storm front
is headed for Seattle.

11:54.791 --> 11:56.705
Don't want to be on those roads.

11:57.139 --> 11:59.342
I was just reading this article
about a bubble man.

11:59.581 --> 12:01.594
He comes to your party
and makes big bubbles.

12:01.841 --> 12:03.230
Saint alive!

12:03.355 --> 12:05.682
Minus 14 in Minneapolis?

12:05.807 --> 12:08.143
- No, thank you.
- Is that...

12:08.268 --> 12:11.313
Is he...
Great. Nice. Good.

12:13.827 --> 12:16.943
I'll just hit back to the lab straighten
this thing out once and for all.

12:17.264 --> 12:20.038
You do that. Do something right
for once in your life.

12:20.163 --> 12:21.400
Shut up, old man.

12:22.883 --> 12:24.241
Steve, Lisa called.

12:24.434 --> 12:26.528
She's agreed to give you
one more chance

12:26.653 --> 12:28.329
and wants to meet you later today

12:30.110 --> 12:31.435
Gross!

12:31.560 --> 12:32.878
What am I gonna do?

12:33.003 --> 12:35.436
If I show up like this,
she'll never believe it's me.

12:35.561 --> 12:39.165
I'll have to think of something.
Something clever and easy to explain.

12:40.228 --> 12:41.801
Hi, I'm future Steve.

12:42.061 --> 12:45.544
I've been sent back in time
80 years by the Imperial Order

12:45.669 --> 12:47.681
of which I am recording secretary.

12:47.851 --> 12:50.565
- What?
- I remember these...

12:50.934 --> 12:53.813
Now, I've been commissioned
with 2 responsibilities.

12:54.132 --> 12:56.887
First, to assure you
that Steve will be at the dance

12:57.012 --> 12:59.620
and is looking forward to it.
And second...

13:06.995 --> 13:09.572
They're bringin back
the old sleeping booths!

13:09.697 --> 13:10.762
Hurray!

13:16.781 --> 13:20.384
I found him sleeping in a booth with,
like, 4 other old people.

13:21.263 --> 13:22.997
- Did you get the shot?
- Right here.

13:23.122 --> 13:26.304
- This'll make him 14 again.
- It's gonna be hell for all of us.

13:26.557 --> 13:28.316
Yes, especially Steve.

13:28.651 --> 13:30.158
Horrible time, puberty.

13:30.283 --> 13:32.685
Years of sadness, rejection
and confusion.

13:32.810 --> 13:34.309
He'll look weird, smell weird,

13:34.434 --> 13:36.559
his voice will change,
he'll get painful acnea.

13:36.734 --> 13:39.587
Backnea, assnea, inner-earnea...
He comes from an oily family.

13:39.712 --> 13:41.889
Plus, he'll be getting his butt kicked
through it all.

13:42.014 --> 13:43.737
The senseless beatings!

13:43.949 --> 13:47.283
Have you ever been beaten naked
in a gym shower, Stan?

13:48.514 --> 13:51.327
One day, when I was showering
after gym class,

13:51.452 --> 13:53.716
these mean pretty girls caught me

13:53.864 --> 13:56.964
and kept scrubbing me
all over with soap.

13:57.128 --> 13:59.775
I mean, they didn't miss a spot!

14:00.156 --> 14:04.268
And even though we were all wet
and naked and slippery,

14:04.514 --> 14:07.548
they were still able
to get me on all fours,

14:07.673 --> 14:09.700
and shove my face to the floor.

14:10.555 --> 14:12.433
Can you imagine, Stan?

14:13.525 --> 14:15.468
How'd they catch you again, please?

14:15.593 --> 14:17.605
Wait, Steve... Where did he go?

14:22.163 --> 14:24.795
They tried to make me
put my bag under the box,

14:24.920 --> 14:28.181
but I told them,
"That bag stays with me!"

14:28.306 --> 14:30.365
They tried to make me 14 again.

14:30.490 --> 14:32.245
But I'm not going through that hell.

14:32.415 --> 14:34.330
- I'm staying 80.
- That's nice.

14:35.063 --> 14:37.922
Here is a picture
of my grandson, Billy.

14:38.240 --> 14:39.801
I go to school with him.

14:39.926 --> 14:41.517
He's a total douche.

14:42.521 --> 14:43.457
I know.

14:50.032 --> 14:52.075
- Steve!
- He's not in the toolshed.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.101
But I did find
your highschool yearbook.

14:54.226 --> 14:56.872
You show me which girls did
that mean stuff to you.

14:56.997 --> 14:59.513
Was it this gymnastics girl?
Right? Right?

14:59.984 --> 15:02.066
What about this girl?
Did this girl walk in on it?

15:02.236 --> 15:03.243
Not now.

15:03.368 --> 15:05.842
Our little 80-year-old boy
is out there,

15:05.967 --> 15:07.446
scared and all alone!

15:09.502 --> 15:12.449
- Have you seen Steve?
- I dropped him off at the bus station.

15:12.574 --> 15:14.428
Did he say where he's going?

15:14.553 --> 15:16.318
He said he'll live out
the rest of his days

15:16.443 --> 15:19.020
- in some retirement home.
- What? Which one?

15:19.145 --> 15:21.630
The Cross Feed-in.
I just made that up, I don't know.

15:21.755 --> 15:22.879
How could you?

15:23.183 --> 15:25.798
It was a real struggle.
I wrestled with it. Not easy.

15:25.923 --> 15:27.716
Now, we can focus on my birthday.

15:27.976 --> 15:29.510
I want a bike, just like this one.

15:29.635 --> 15:31.734
Except not stolen
from the kid down the street.

15:31.859 --> 15:33.469
Apparently, his nanny
gave it to him.

15:33.594 --> 15:35.339
What she needs to give him
is an ice pack,

15:35.464 --> 15:37.270
because I slapped him in the face.

15:38.353 --> 15:41.397
Wait, where are you going?
Let's talk about my birthday!

15:42.211 --> 15:43.502
Well, that's it.

15:43.627 --> 15:46.541
I'm gonna spend
my 1600th birthday alone.

15:47.353 --> 15:49.037
Just like a sequoia.

15:55.414 --> 15:57.334
Come on, I34!

15:57.697 --> 16:00.411
Steve Smith, have a telephone!

16:00.536 --> 16:03.027
Watch my card.
And rub my lucky monkey.

16:03.152 --> 16:05.671
Before he picks the ball, not after.
Doesn't good after.

16:07.689 --> 16:09.351
Steve, we finally found you!

16:09.476 --> 16:11.494
- What are you doing there?
- I'm living here.

16:11.619 --> 16:14.571
I heard you and Mom
talking about all that teenage stuff.

16:14.696 --> 16:17.960
I'm happy I skipped all that
and now I get to relax here.

16:18.085 --> 16:20.193
Plus, there are shuffle boards,
cards,

16:20.318 --> 16:23.011
someone's niece came in
and played the harp, it was wonderful.

16:23.136 --> 16:25.627
That's crazy. We're coming
down there with the shot.

16:25.752 --> 16:28.945
Come near me with that shot and
I'll swallow the whole medicine cabinet.

16:29.070 --> 16:32.243
Uppers, downers,
stool hardeners, stool softeners.

16:32.368 --> 16:34.013
My stools won't know what to do!

16:34.138 --> 16:36.376
But that will be
the mortician's problem.

16:38.712 --> 16:41.390
He says growing up sounds too hard.

16:41.780 --> 16:43.912
He just wants to stay an old man.

16:44.561 --> 16:46.222
We've lost our son.

16:46.431 --> 16:49.408
Because of us,
he missed out on his whole life.

16:49.533 --> 16:51.260
What are we gonna do?

16:53.295 --> 16:54.366
Who is this?

16:55.569 --> 16:57.632
No, Steve's not here.

16:57.977 --> 17:01.062
But don't worry.
Everything's gonna be fine.

17:04.308 --> 17:05.969
Bravo, Aiden.

17:06.094 --> 17:08.847
Looks like everyone's
having a fun time.

17:08.972 --> 17:11.300
- Are you a kid?
- That'll do, Aiden.

17:11.621 --> 17:13.490
What... What did you wait?

17:13.615 --> 17:15.987
A whole 6 years for a bouncy castle?

17:16.112 --> 17:18.201
Yeah, try 1600!

17:18.326 --> 17:20.877
- This should have been my party.
- Mom!

17:21.002 --> 17:23.321
Your mama's dead, boy.
I killed her.

17:23.592 --> 17:24.673
No, I didn't.

17:24.798 --> 17:26.915
I just... I went too far.
That wasn't cool.

17:27.040 --> 17:28.585
This is Steve's fault.

17:28.710 --> 17:30.364
He ruined my birthday.

17:30.489 --> 17:32.292
And I'm gonna make him pay.

17:34.855 --> 17:38.141
I'm gonna go get my face painted
and then get the hell out of here.

17:41.813 --> 17:43.148
I've got arthritis.

17:43.273 --> 17:45.753
My cataracts
are as thick as nickels.

17:45.878 --> 17:47.043
I'm a virgin.

17:47.559 --> 17:50.362
- We got to get you laid.
- Road trip.

17:53.666 --> 17:55.290
Mom! Dad!

17:59.326 --> 18:01.204
Don't you come near me
with that needle.

18:01.602 --> 18:03.828
Honey, we're just here to talk.

18:04.091 --> 18:05.751
I'm putting it on the ground.

18:06.010 --> 18:07.562
It stinks in here.

18:08.797 --> 18:10.378
It's just so unexpected.

18:10.503 --> 18:12.786
I mean, the outside
is so nicely landscaped.

18:12.911 --> 18:14.511
Kick the needle over to me.

18:14.906 --> 18:17.447
Here it is. Nice and easy.

18:18.317 --> 18:21.421
It smells worse than that dumpster
at the crab restaurant.

18:21.546 --> 18:23.445
Steve, we're so sorry.

18:23.570 --> 18:25.227
This is all our fault.

18:25.397 --> 18:27.632
We were only thinking
of ourselves...

18:27.929 --> 18:29.445
Now, I smell it!

18:29.881 --> 18:32.055
It's like an egg and garlic

18:32.276 --> 18:33.964
farted in a sulfer pit.

18:34.089 --> 18:36.445
There's like a heat behind it.

18:39.715 --> 18:41.105
We tried to deprive you

18:41.230 --> 18:43.337
of the most important years
of your life.

18:43.462 --> 18:45.457
Just to make it easier on us.

18:45.582 --> 18:48.098
Yes, there's lots of bad stuff
about puberty.

18:48.223 --> 18:49.918
But, there's good stuff too.

18:51.021 --> 18:52.031
Like what?

18:55.427 --> 18:57.639
See, Steve? Lisa Silver.

18:58.112 --> 18:59.486
And she's waiting for you.

18:59.611 --> 19:01.838
When she called the house,
it made me remember

19:01.963 --> 19:05.142
that puberty wasn't all bad.
There's stuff you don't want to miss.

19:05.312 --> 19:07.822
Your first school dance,
getting your driver's license,

19:07.947 --> 19:11.395
going over to your best friend's house
finding his mother ODed in the tub,

19:11.520 --> 19:13.233
or however you cop your first feel.

19:13.446 --> 19:15.277
Come on, Steve. What do you say?

19:17.102 --> 19:18.113
Give me the shot.

19:25.009 --> 19:26.437
Sorry I'm late.

19:29.192 --> 19:30.376
I lost track of time.

19:31.262 --> 19:32.763
<i>I don't want to wait</i>

19:33.255 --> 19:35.981
<i>for our lives to be over</i>

19:43.413 --> 19:45.600
Hey, everyone. Check it out!

19:46.687 --> 19:48.562
He's only got one pube!

19:49.183 --> 19:52.397
- And it's red!
- Let's give him a swirlie!

19:56.215 --> 19:57.196
Wait!

19:57.949 --> 19:59.283
Please!

20:00.961 --> 20:03.492
We did say there were
crappy times, right?

20:45.645 --> 20:48.463
Serves Steve right.
Stealing my thunder.

20:48.861 --> 20:49.932
Still...

20:50.150 --> 20:52.664
I can't believe
everyone forgot my birthday.

20:52.789 --> 20:54.262
Not everyone.

21:00.008 --> 21:01.135
Yeah, you.

21:01.996 --> 21:03.773
Happy birthday, Roger.

21:04.105 --> 21:05.287
Make a wish.

21:05.412 --> 21:07.427
It already came true.

21:11.385 --> 21:13.760
I hate Steve so much.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
