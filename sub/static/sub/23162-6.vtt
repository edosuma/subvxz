WEBVTT

00:06.224 --> 00:08.454
That was one of the guys
that killed your dad.

00:09.093 --> 00:12.460
A friend of mine is dead
and his son is missing.

00:12.530 --> 00:14.191
Please find my son, T.C.

00:14.265 --> 00:15.323
I'm working!

00:15.399 --> 00:17.594
Today was his funeral
and you weren't there.

00:19.704 --> 00:22.639
The both of them took off and I
think it was to go after those boys.

00:22.707 --> 00:23.867
That would be a real mistake.

00:23.941 --> 00:25.875
My friend was killed

00:25.943 --> 00:28.309
because you robbed a store.

01:38.049 --> 01:39.949
Basketball is a simple game.

01:40.084 --> 01:42.552
And it really hasn't changed
much since Dr. Naismith

01:42.620 --> 01:45.555
nailed up that peach basket
some 90 years ago.

01:45.656 --> 01:47.783
The object of the game
is still to throw the ball

01:47.858 --> 01:50.053
through the hole more times
than the other guys.

01:52.663 --> 01:53.891
We got them on the run!

01:53.965 --> 01:55.455
But as you get older,

01:55.533 --> 01:57.728
you also find yourself
playing some tough D

01:57.802 --> 02:01.738
against that fast-breaking combo
of mortality and Dr. Time himself.

02:02.239 --> 02:04.434
That's why my occasional
Saturday mornings

02:04.508 --> 02:08.000
of a little three-on-three with T. C.
and our buddy Ron, against these kids

02:08.079 --> 02:10.639
have become a little more
than just recreation.

02:10.914 --> 02:13.179
Recreation's fine,
but winning

02:13.250 --> 02:15.013
has somehow become sweeter.

02:16.887 --> 02:19.720
Chalk another one
up to experience,

02:19.857 --> 02:22.325
teamwork,
and six deadly eyes!

02:22.393 --> 02:23.883
And six dead legs.

02:24.595 --> 02:26.495
Speak for yourself, Thomas.

02:27.431 --> 02:30.161
You boys want to give us old
men one more taste of victory?

02:30.234 --> 02:33.601
You sure about that, Ronnie? I mean,
maybe we ought to call the paramedics

02:33.671 --> 02:35.298
and have them standing by
just in case.

02:36.941 --> 02:38.670
Look here,
we are just getting warm.

02:38.743 --> 02:40.142
Hey, man I thought
you had to get home?

02:40.211 --> 02:43.180
I do. But I got enough for
one more game for the road.

02:43.247 --> 02:45.340
I guess one more game
won't kill anybody.

03:35.666 --> 03:38.965
Man, I don't care if l never play
another basketball game in my life.

03:39.036 --> 03:40.765
At least not for
six or seven years.

03:41.272 --> 03:42.739
How about
watching one instead?

03:42.807 --> 03:45.139
76ers and Lakers.
I got it on cable.

03:45.509 --> 03:46.840
Sheila won't mind?

03:46.911 --> 03:48.503
Mind? Come on, T.C.,
you're family.

03:48.579 --> 03:50.308
And she hasn't
seen you in months.

03:50.381 --> 03:51.439
Hey, that's great.

03:54.318 --> 03:57.651
I promised Higgins I'd help
him catalog Robin Masters'

03:57.721 --> 03:59.621
collection of
detective fiction.

03:59.990 --> 04:02.550
Detective fiction?
How much could he have?

04:03.661 --> 04:06.528
All of it. A personal favor
to Mr. Masters.

04:06.964 --> 04:10.127
Listen, if I hurry maybe I can
get there for the second half.

04:10.201 --> 04:11.532
You're on.
T.C.: Good luck.

04:11.869 --> 04:14.895
With Higgie baby, though, you might
make it by halftime next season.

04:14.972 --> 04:16.303
I'll be there.

04:23.380 --> 04:26.008
Sheila said she'd keep the fire going.
Burgers okay?

04:26.217 --> 04:27.479
How many?

04:30.654 --> 04:34.055
Well, you think Dr. J is gonna
hang it up at the end of this season?

04:34.125 --> 04:35.490
I hope not.

04:35.926 --> 04:38.053
Man, he's an inspiration
to all us...

04:38.129 --> 04:40.063
All you old guys.

04:42.133 --> 04:45.125
You know, I think old age
really starts hitting you

04:45.202 --> 04:48.831
when you realize that all of your
heroes are younger than you are

04:49.039 --> 04:50.768
and even they're
considered old.

04:53.344 --> 04:55.278
Especially if you've
got a 17-year-old son

04:55.346 --> 04:57.075
that almost outjumps you...

04:57.148 --> 04:58.843
And outshoots you!

05:02.586 --> 05:04.645
How's Ronnie Jr. doing,
anyway?

05:07.525 --> 05:08.992
I don't know, man.

05:10.728 --> 05:13.026
He's not talking to me
too much these days.

05:14.532 --> 05:16.090
Maybe you better ask him.

05:16.467 --> 05:18.230
Oh, what is it this time?

05:21.438 --> 05:24.100
I think the psychologists
call it alienation.

05:24.175 --> 05:25.164
Oh...

05:27.711 --> 05:29.372
Hey, that's nothing, huh?

05:29.713 --> 05:31.647
I mean, it's all
part of growing old.

05:32.516 --> 05:34.780
First they need you,
then you need them.

05:36.487 --> 05:38.978
Except right now,
I don't think he needs anybody.

05:40.491 --> 05:41.924
Hey, Sheila asked me
to stop by

05:41.992 --> 05:44.460
and pick up some hamburger
buns on the way back. You mind?

05:44.762 --> 05:46.093
Oh, no. No.

05:55.606 --> 05:57.267
T.C.: And don't
forget my Gatorade.

05:57.341 --> 05:59.070
Man, I'm dying
of thirst here.

05:59.210 --> 06:01.110
You got it. Be right back.

06:06.450 --> 06:09.442
Oh, hey, the orange kind.

06:23.067 --> 06:27.094
Doctor, I just don't
know, except lately when my husband

06:27.171 --> 06:29.662
comes home from work,
he doesn't want to do a thing.

06:30.407 --> 06:31.635
Nothing.

06:31.709 --> 06:34.177
It doesn't matter what kind
of sexy clothes I'm wearing,

06:34.245 --> 06:36.440
or what kind of perfume
I've got on,

06:36.513 --> 06:39.038
or even the Johnny Mathis
records on the stereo.

06:39.116 --> 06:41.141
It just doesn't matter.

06:41.518 --> 06:44.453
All he wants to do is watch
a damn basketball game.

06:44.521 --> 06:45.920
What should I do?

06:45.990 --> 06:48.185
If I was you, I'd leave
the poor sucker alone.

06:52.596 --> 06:54.860
Not only are you getting old
you're getting senile.

06:54.932 --> 06:56.593
This is green.

06:56.667 --> 06:58.794
Oh, that's right.
You wanted orange.

06:58.869 --> 07:00.700
It's all right,
I'll take it back and exchange it.

07:00.771 --> 07:02.830
Hey, look, I'll take it back.
Look, I'm the youngest.

07:02.906 --> 07:04.168
After all, I'm the one
that messed up.

07:04.241 --> 07:05.799
That's okay,
I'll drink it green.

07:05.876 --> 07:08.037
Come on, T.C.,
I'll be right back.

07:18.789 --> 07:21.451
So watch one of
those silly ballgames with him,

07:21.525 --> 07:23.789
Iearn a little bit about them

07:23.861 --> 07:26.955
so you can communicate
in his own language.

07:27.097 --> 07:30.430
But at the same time,
do it totally nude,

07:30.534 --> 07:31.933
side by side.

07:32.002 --> 07:34.368
Then I guarantee you,
by halftime,

07:34.438 --> 07:36.872
he'll be watching you
instead of Larry Bird.

07:36.940 --> 07:40.000
Thank you, doctor.
I hope I don't catch cold.

07:52.456 --> 07:53.923
Yo, Ron!

07:59.063 --> 08:00.257
Ron!

08:00.998 --> 08:02.727
Father, are you all right?

08:04.568 --> 08:05.660
You okay?

08:06.036 --> 08:07.230
Ron.

08:11.008 --> 08:12.134
Ronnie!

08:57.988 --> 08:59.387
They hit my father.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.350
He doesn't speak
very good English

09:03.460 --> 09:05.485
and I think at first he
didn't know what was going on

09:05.562 --> 09:07.189
until they pulled a gun.

09:09.466 --> 09:10.831
He tried to fight them,

09:10.901 --> 09:12.334
that's when
one of them hurt him.

09:12.403 --> 09:14.200
Hit him with the gun?
Yes.

09:14.371 --> 09:15.463
T.C.: Where were you?

09:15.539 --> 09:17.905
I was in the cooler,
stocking the soft drinks.

09:18.475 --> 09:21.205
I heard the commotion,
that's when I ran outside.

09:21.278 --> 09:22.836
And saw what, precisely?

09:23.113 --> 09:25.604
I saw them turn
and shoot this man's friend.

09:25.983 --> 09:27.644
He was in the juice aisle.

09:28.218 --> 09:30.743
He was going to help my
father and they shot him.

09:31.488 --> 09:33.786
We'll be in touch.
Thank you, Andy.

09:38.529 --> 09:40.156
Did you get
a good look at them?

09:41.298 --> 09:43.493
One haole, one local,

09:44.101 --> 09:45.830
one local guy
driving a car.

09:46.637 --> 09:48.002
No license?

09:50.073 --> 09:52.405
Just a brand new
black Continental.

09:52.876 --> 09:54.366
Guess they stole it.

09:55.813 --> 09:58.680
I'm gonna find out.
Put it in the computer right away.

09:58.749 --> 10:01.047
If it turns up, we've got
a good shot at them.

10:14.298 --> 10:16.266
When you find them,
I want to be there.

10:17.701 --> 10:18.929
I'll call you later.

10:19.002 --> 10:21.869
Right now, I've got to see
Mr. Pennington's family.

10:22.372 --> 10:23.862
No, you don't. I do.

10:24.842 --> 10:26.104
It's my duty.

10:27.144 --> 10:29.908
No, it isn't. It's mine.

11:14.658 --> 11:16.489
Forget your key again, Ron?

11:16.560 --> 11:19.461
Or did you just have trouble
remembering where you live?

11:19.763 --> 11:23.221
T.C. I hope you guys like
your hamburgers well done.

11:23.433 --> 11:24.627
Where's Ron?

11:31.174 --> 11:32.402
Where's Ron?

11:46.072 --> 11:48.063
I guess
when I think of funerals,

11:48.141 --> 11:50.109
I think of dark,
drizzly days

11:50.177 --> 11:52.941
and everybody dressed up
in long gray overcoats.

11:53.079 --> 11:55.445
Kind of like
a black and white movie.

11:55.549 --> 11:58.643
I mean, it's real hard to
reconcile death and rainbows.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.917
Especially when you're
at a funeral of a friend

12:00.987 --> 12:02.716
who spent a lifetime
collecting them.

12:06.426 --> 12:07.916
T.C.: He'll show up.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.422
When?

12:09.563 --> 12:11.793
You only bury
your father once.

12:13.066 --> 12:16.627
One day when he's older, he's going
to be real sorry he wasn't here.

12:17.204 --> 12:18.831
Maybe he's real sorry now.

12:19.606 --> 12:21.198
Then where is he, Thomas?

12:24.211 --> 12:25.701
I'll go find him.

12:26.813 --> 12:28.838
Will you take care
of Sheila and Jan?

12:29.316 --> 12:31.147
What if you do
find him, T.C.?

12:31.751 --> 12:32.945
What are you
gonna say to him?

12:33.019 --> 12:34.884
What makes you think it'll
be any different with you

12:34.955 --> 12:36.286
than it was
with his father?

12:37.290 --> 12:39.520
Well, I don't know
whether it will or not.

12:40.193 --> 12:42.388
I'm gonna give it a try.
Tom.

12:42.762 --> 12:43.990
Mrs. Pennington?

12:44.064 --> 12:46.225
Come on, Sheila,
I'll help you get ready.

12:46.299 --> 12:48.529
Thomas, I really don't
feel like seeing anybody now.

12:48.602 --> 12:49.899
Mrs. Pennington?

12:51.171 --> 12:53.298
Excuse me, my name
is Andy Nguyen.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.903
My father's very sorry he
couldn't be here this morning.

12:57.410 --> 12:59.173
The concussion's
very painful.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.909
But he wanted me to
express our family's sorrow

13:03.149 --> 13:05.845
and our gratitude for what
your husband tried to do.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.387
We're truly sorry.

13:09.356 --> 13:10.550
Thank you.

13:15.428 --> 13:17.362
That must have been
real hard for him.

13:18.431 --> 13:20.194
Please find my son, T.C.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.597
Let's just slow down
a little bit, huh?

13:27.307 --> 13:29.070
Hey, slow down
a little bit, huh?

13:31.011 --> 13:32.137
Watch out.
- Hey!

13:32.212 --> 13:33.372
Hey, watch out!

13:36.416 --> 13:38.179
Hey, pull over, huh?
Pull over!

13:38.518 --> 13:39.746
Pull over!

13:44.791 --> 13:46.884
20 bucks.
No, you're kidding me.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.326
You almost got us killed.
20 bucks.

13:49.396 --> 13:51.489
You're lucky we're
not calling the cops.

13:51.698 --> 13:53.063
Come on, honey.

14:09.783 --> 14:10.977
T.C.: Drive.

14:12.419 --> 14:15.479
Forget it, T.C., I don't need
any more grief. Leave me alone.

14:15.555 --> 14:16.920
Just drive.

14:17.290 --> 14:18.848
Leave me alone.
I'm working.

14:20.393 --> 14:21.485
Here.

14:22.595 --> 14:24.529
I'm paying for my time.
Now drive!

14:40.013 --> 14:43.540
You're wasting your time, T.C. Save your
speeches for your Little League Team.

14:43.616 --> 14:46.050
Ain't gonna be no speeches,
but we are going to talk.

14:46.353 --> 14:47.547
About what?

14:48.588 --> 14:49.953
About your mom, man.

14:50.023 --> 14:51.957
Oh, come on, now, T.C.,
that's not fair.

14:52.025 --> 14:53.492
Who's trying to be fair?

14:53.793 --> 14:55.761
You are hurting
your mother, Ronnie.

14:57.130 --> 14:59.325
I guess that just runs
in the family, right?

14:59.399 --> 15:01.594
I mean, same name
and everything, too.

15:02.736 --> 15:04.727
He couldn't even
give me my own name.

15:04.804 --> 15:06.101
He gave you...

15:07.440 --> 15:10.409
He and she gave you that name
because they were proud of you.

15:10.477 --> 15:12.502
They were proud
of that name.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.911
Well, they sure had
a funny way of showing it.

15:14.981 --> 15:17.506
What's that supposed to mean?
What's that supposed to...

15:17.584 --> 15:20.348
Are you serious, T.C.?
Where you been?

15:21.721 --> 15:23.313
I mean, I haven't even...

15:24.891 --> 15:29.157
My mom hasn't had a real good look
at my dad since we settled here.

15:29.529 --> 15:32.259
He's either at that lame
bureaucrat job,

15:32.332 --> 15:34.266
or at the playground
with you.

15:34.334 --> 15:37.667
Shooting baskets with you and the
other guys like a bunch of kids.

15:38.738 --> 15:41.502
Hell, you probably knew him
better than I did.

15:45.712 --> 15:48.237
My dad abandoned his family
a long time ago.

15:51.051 --> 15:53.144
Except he did it
without leaving.

15:54.754 --> 15:56.085
Pretty neat trick, huh?

15:56.156 --> 15:57.783
But it don't matter.

15:57.857 --> 16:00.382
Today was his funeral
and you weren't there.

16:00.593 --> 16:02.618
What are you running from?

16:02.695 --> 16:03.923
I'm working!

16:04.064 --> 16:06.897
Stop! Stop this thing.
Stop it right now.

16:09.836 --> 16:12.430
I think you're running away
because you care!

16:12.505 --> 16:14.803
You're wrong. Wrong!
I'm past that.

16:15.008 --> 16:16.498
Well, I'm not.

16:16.743 --> 16:19.075
Your father was a good man
and he was my friend.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.739
And that lame
bureaucratic job

16:21.815 --> 16:25.911
probably did more for people than any
100 laws or shouters or do-gooders...

16:25.985 --> 16:29.045
Oh, come on, T.C. He worked for
the City Planning Commission.

16:29.589 --> 16:32.524
He wore a dumb tie and
disappeared for 16 hours a day.

16:33.059 --> 16:36.051
Then he spent the rest of his
time with you guys, at the park.

16:36.196 --> 16:39.495
Ron Pennington is the
reason there is a park.

16:39.599 --> 16:43.262
He's also the reason that clubs
and discos that discriminate

16:43.336 --> 16:45.998
get closed down if they
don't get their act together.

16:47.040 --> 16:50.373
And don't think that fighting
for other folk 16 hours a day

16:50.443 --> 16:51.705
don't take its toll.

16:51.778 --> 16:54.542
He probably had to run up and
down that basketball court

16:54.614 --> 16:56.411
just to get it
out of his system.

16:56.749 --> 16:57.977
You know what, Ronnie,

16:58.051 --> 17:00.485
you find it easy to find
fault with your dad,

17:00.553 --> 17:02.521
but you know what's hard for you?
What's hard for you

17:02.589 --> 17:04.682
is seeing that there's a
lot in him to be proud of.

17:06.192 --> 17:08.285
Man, he really dug you
and your mom.

17:10.497 --> 17:12.260
Now, maybe that
wasn't enough for you,

17:12.866 --> 17:14.925
but I think he did
the best he could.

17:21.241 --> 17:23.106
Then why'd he have to
go and die on me?

17:24.877 --> 17:27.005
Die on you?
Die on you?

17:27.146 --> 17:28.739
Man, he lived for you.

17:29.649 --> 17:31.014
In fact he'd still
be living for you

17:31.084 --> 17:33.279
if I had gone into that store
like I started.

17:33.353 --> 17:34.718
So I only want two things.

17:34.787 --> 17:38.917
Number one, I want
your family to have peace,

17:39.626 --> 17:41.594
and number two,
I want to find the people

17:41.661 --> 17:43.424
responsible for
what happened.

17:43.496 --> 17:44.963
Now you can help me
on the first one

17:45.031 --> 17:47.556
if you're not too busy
feeling sorry for yourself.

17:48.067 --> 17:52.163
Now, I'd appreciate it and your mom
would, too, Ronald Pennington Jr.

17:57.210 --> 17:58.370
Death.

18:01.414 --> 18:02.506
Death.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.245
Death.

18:09.489 --> 18:11.252
Ah, here they are.

18:12.192 --> 18:15.320
Death Among Friends,
Death At Lords.

18:15.461 --> 18:18.157
Death Before Bedtime,
Death by Dreaming.

18:18.264 --> 18:20.027
Death At the BBC.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.125
How extraordinary.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.733
Yes, it is, Higgins.

18:27.173 --> 18:28.470
Real extraordinary.

18:28.541 --> 18:32.375
Extraordinary is a superlative,
real extraordinary is a redundancy.

18:32.745 --> 18:36.909
However, I was referring to your rather
unorthodox method of filing books.

18:37.083 --> 18:38.209
By title.

18:38.952 --> 18:41.614
Don't you care about
the Dewey Decimal system?

18:42.522 --> 18:45.150
At this moment,
not particularly.

18:48.194 --> 18:50.526
You know what's real
extraordinary, Higgins,

18:51.664 --> 18:54.792
is how many people
trivialize the word death

18:56.069 --> 18:59.402
in their book titles and their
movie titles just to make a buck.

19:00.773 --> 19:02.866
That will be all
for now, Maile. Thank you.

19:07.013 --> 19:09.277
Magnum, I believe
there's a difference

19:09.349 --> 19:13.342
between trivializing such a profound
event and mere entertainment.

19:13.686 --> 19:17.178
Unfortunately, sometimes,
the line often gets blurred.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.682
Did you find out anything
illuminating at the store?

19:21.361 --> 19:22.885
No. Nothing illuminating.

19:22.962 --> 19:25.362
Unless you count
a lot of flat neon lights

19:25.431 --> 19:27.262
that don't illuminate
a damn thing.

19:28.334 --> 19:29.961
Now that the glass
is cleaned up,

19:30.303 --> 19:33.067
Andy is behind the counter
instead of his dad.

19:33.139 --> 19:34.834
And it's business as usual.

19:34.907 --> 19:36.772
Well, of course it is.
They're poor immigrants.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.333
That store is
their livelihood.

19:38.411 --> 19:39.935
I know that, Higgins.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.840
He's a good kid.

19:43.916 --> 19:45.110
You know something,

19:45.184 --> 19:48.153
they've been robbed over a
dozen times in the last year.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.413
Yet they persevere.

19:51.291 --> 19:52.417
I suppose...

19:54.227 --> 19:55.489
Robin Masters' Estate.
- Higgins?

19:55.561 --> 19:57.358
Yes, one moment, Rick.

19:59.098 --> 20:00.122
Yeah?

20:00.199 --> 20:02.565
Thomas, I think I got
what you're looking for.

20:02.735 --> 20:03.793
Great.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.338
But I had to pull in
every favor that I had.

20:06.606 --> 20:08.267
Plus, the big one.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.368
Ice Pick's daughter, Hilda?

20:11.444 --> 20:12.638
You got it.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.403
How many dates?

20:14.881 --> 20:16.246
It's more than that.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.580
More than... You...

20:20.953 --> 20:22.045
No, he's not...

20:22.121 --> 20:23.383
He's making you...

20:23.456 --> 20:24.923
Look, can we
talk about this later?

20:24.991 --> 20:27.118
Do you want the information on
the black Continental or not?

20:27.193 --> 20:28.421
Sure, go ahead.

20:30.163 --> 20:32.222
Well, I found at least
parts of it

20:32.298 --> 20:34.198
in a chop-shop
over in Waimanalo.

20:34.300 --> 20:35.790
Any registration?

20:35.868 --> 20:37.631
To No-Lemons Rent-A-Car.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.095
Well, that's a dead-end.

20:40.173 --> 20:42.107
Not necessarily.
The car was stolen

20:42.175 --> 20:45.076
from a couple of rich tourists
the other night down in Waikiki.

20:45.144 --> 20:46.736
Great. That is a dead-end.

20:47.046 --> 20:50.038
Not necessarily. Wait till I tell
you where it was stolen from.

20:53.986 --> 20:55.248
Hi, Kika.

20:55.321 --> 20:57.755
Hey, Magnum, T.C.
How's it?

20:59.692 --> 21:01.557
Listen, congratulations
on your promotion.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.226
You don't drive anymore?

21:04.297 --> 21:08.165
Hey, you get old, your legs start to go,
and they kick you upstairs.

21:08.234 --> 21:10.225
I'm management now, brah.

21:10.303 --> 21:12.066
You guys looking for a job?

21:12.138 --> 21:14.129
Oh, no.
Just some information.

21:14.507 --> 21:16.498
Hey, Magnum,
you getting old, too?

21:16.576 --> 21:18.100
Taking on trainees, huh?

21:19.078 --> 21:20.102
What about me?

21:20.179 --> 21:22.579
It's personal, Kika.
We need your help.

21:23.082 --> 21:24.947
What can I do for you?

21:25.485 --> 21:27.043
Uh, a buddy of mine...

21:27.587 --> 21:30.681
Of ours was killed
in a market holdup.

21:30.957 --> 21:34.017
And the guys who did it
stole a black Continental

21:34.527 --> 21:37.223
that was parked right across the
street a couple of nights ago,

21:37.296 --> 21:38.763
by a couple of tourists

21:39.098 --> 21:41.191
who rented some time
on one of your cabs

21:41.267 --> 21:43.633
and we were just wondering if
maybe you saw something, you know.

21:44.771 --> 21:48.400
You know, anybody who was hanging around
who struck you as out of the ordinary?

21:48.908 --> 21:51.308
Everybody down here
is out of the ordinary.

21:52.111 --> 21:54.739
Man, I wish I could help you,
but, you know, so many cabs

21:54.814 --> 21:58.045
and drivers go in and out of this place,
tourists everywhere.

21:58.651 --> 22:02.246
I don't think I could remember unless
they were really weird or something.

22:03.723 --> 22:05.088
Sorry, but l...

22:05.358 --> 22:06.484
Hey!

22:32.819 --> 22:34.150
I need your cab, man!

22:35.521 --> 22:36.715
Ronnie!

22:38.224 --> 22:39.384
What?

22:43.563 --> 22:45.155
T.C., what's going on?

22:46.999 --> 22:49.399
That was one of the guys
that killed your dad.

23:11.156 --> 23:14.489
Like I said, it's your leg
that goes first, huh?

23:15.794 --> 23:17.125
Thanks, Kika.

23:17.596 --> 23:20.394
Hey, um, I'm sorry
it was one of my guys, huh?

23:21.133 --> 23:22.964
You got an address on him?

23:23.035 --> 23:24.332
Yeah, but...

23:24.403 --> 23:26.963
But he's not gonna be
anywhere near there now.

23:27.439 --> 23:28.701
Hey, try the cops.

23:31.010 --> 23:32.375
He got a record?

23:32.644 --> 23:34.168
Yeah, in a way.

23:34.279 --> 23:36.907
You see, all my drivers are
registered with the police.

23:37.049 --> 23:39.711
City rule, you know,
regulate the industry

23:39.785 --> 23:41.514
so the tourists
don't get ripped off.

23:41.587 --> 23:43.817
Maybe you can find out
something down there.

23:44.757 --> 23:45.917
Appreciate it.

23:45.991 --> 23:48.482
Go for it.
I hope you get the slime, huh?

23:54.833 --> 23:56.391
Ronnie knew him.

23:56.535 --> 23:58.400
Yeah. Looked that way.

23:59.371 --> 24:01.430
What do you mean,
looked that way? He knew him!

24:03.308 --> 24:04.468
We'll find him.

24:04.543 --> 24:06.033
And then what?

24:06.111 --> 24:09.274
It's as though everything I said
didn't even get through to him.

24:10.649 --> 24:12.674
Probably the same problem
that Ron had with him.

24:12.751 --> 24:15.549
I want to find the other guy,
Sammy Garns.

24:15.721 --> 24:18.554
Well, let's go see Tanaka,
we'll check him out.

24:18.724 --> 24:20.021
No, no, no, no, no.

24:20.659 --> 24:21.887
You go.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.487
I got something else
I gotta do first.

24:38.010 --> 24:40.137
No, I don't know
where he go.

24:40.212 --> 24:42.043
And I don't know why he go.

24:51.723 --> 24:53.714
Yesterday, I had a family.

24:56.862 --> 24:59.057
Yesterday, I had
a little baby.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.856
Why's it all been
taken from me, T.C.?

25:03.869 --> 25:05.700
Maybe not all. Maybe...

25:05.771 --> 25:08.399
That's that same
misguided optimism Ron had.

25:08.874 --> 25:12.469
It may be bleak, but there's still
some light out there. No matter what.

25:12.811 --> 25:14.676
Where'd anybody be

25:14.813 --> 25:18.271
without some kind of optimism,
misguided or not?

25:18.784 --> 25:20.752
Maybe back in Philly.
That's where.

25:21.553 --> 25:24.044
Maybe back with our family,
our friends.

25:24.189 --> 25:25.281
Home.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.882
You and Ron have
lived here for 10 years.

25:27.960 --> 25:29.951
This still isn't home.

25:30.929 --> 25:32.260
I tried.

25:33.065 --> 25:36.296
But, somehow, things just never
turned out like we planned.

25:40.506 --> 25:42.940
I remember when
Ron was discharged.

25:43.142 --> 25:44.666
It was in the middle
of February,

25:44.743 --> 25:47.405
we were under three feet of
snow back on Vine Street.

25:48.213 --> 25:51.114
And he called me from a phone
booth at Wheeler Air Force Base

25:51.183 --> 25:52.741
telling me we had a new home.

25:53.318 --> 25:54.979
He, Ron Jr. and l.

25:55.687 --> 25:57.314
"Paradise," he said.

25:58.290 --> 25:59.814
We took the next plane.

26:00.826 --> 26:03.056
I worked at
a souvenir stand

26:03.128 --> 26:05.824
in Waikiki while Ron
finished his degree.

26:06.798 --> 26:09.494
Then when I'd come home Ron
would leave for his night job

26:09.568 --> 26:11.934
down at that club in the marina,
mixing drinks.

26:13.472 --> 26:14.598
Yeah.

26:16.175 --> 26:19.633
Ron Jr. didn't know either one of
us very much back in those days.

26:25.217 --> 26:27.981
I guess he doesn't know us

26:28.987 --> 26:30.420
very much better now.

26:33.392 --> 26:35.485
We should have
never come here.

26:36.628 --> 26:37.754
Wrong.

26:38.463 --> 26:41.261
Ron working like that
and you working,

26:41.633 --> 26:43.157
why, it's paid off.
I mean, look at...

26:43.235 --> 26:44.668
Look at his job
with the city?

26:45.370 --> 26:46.632
But what about Ron Jr.

26:46.705 --> 26:48.900
hanging out with bums
doing that rickshaw thing

26:48.974 --> 26:50.737
in Waikiki instead of
going to college?

26:51.877 --> 26:53.242
Tell me, T.C.,

26:53.612 --> 26:56.308
what good is any job
without a life?

26:57.216 --> 26:58.877
Without a family?

27:02.020 --> 27:03.544
You have a family.

27:03.822 --> 27:05.016
Where?

27:06.358 --> 27:07.484
Where?

27:34.152 --> 27:35.517
Where were you?

27:37.189 --> 27:38.850
I'm... I'm sorry.

27:41.860 --> 27:43.259
I had to think.

27:45.364 --> 27:46.729
But I'm back.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.489
I'm back now, Mom.

28:02.981 --> 28:05.245
I guess there could be
a case made for the theory

28:05.317 --> 28:07.842
that not every kid has an
equal shot at making it.

28:08.120 --> 28:10.645
Handicaps like being poor
and not being exposed

28:10.722 --> 28:13.748
to some of the better things in
life can make it tough on kids.

28:13.992 --> 28:15.857
Like the kids from this block.

28:15.927 --> 28:17.292
Sammy Garns' block.

28:18.096 --> 28:19.586
But on the other hand,

28:19.665 --> 28:22.065
what about a kid
like Ron Pennington Jr?

28:22.634 --> 28:24.499
A kid who grew up
with loving parents,

28:24.569 --> 28:27.129
grew up not wondering where
his next meal was coming from,

28:27.205 --> 28:29.571
and above all,
grew up in Paradise?

28:30.976 --> 28:33.444
But then, of course,
so did Sammy Garns.

28:41.186 --> 28:42.244
Yes?

28:42.321 --> 28:43.913
Hi, Mrs. Garns?

28:44.256 --> 28:46.053
What kind
do you think it is?

28:46.124 --> 28:47.318
I don't know.
I want one.

28:49.061 --> 28:51.461
I'm looking for Sammy,
Mrs. Garns.

28:51.963 --> 28:53.555
You from his job?

28:53.632 --> 28:55.691
No.
You police then?

28:56.401 --> 28:58.892
No.
Then why you want him for?

29:00.839 --> 29:02.067
Could we talk inside?

29:02.140 --> 29:04.108
No, mister.
We can talk right here.

29:04.242 --> 29:06.107
Why do you want Sammy?

29:06.912 --> 29:08.709
He's in some trouble.

29:08.780 --> 29:10.611
Sammy's always in trouble.

29:10.682 --> 29:12.980
Look,
a friend of mine is dead

29:13.051 --> 29:15.781
and his son is missing
because of this trouble.

29:16.254 --> 29:18.347
Sammy may know where he is.

29:29.034 --> 29:31.628
Sammy's been gone
for three weeks now.

29:33.672 --> 29:36.436
He shares this room
with his two little brothers.

29:37.709 --> 29:40.109
Maybe it just got
too crowded for him.

29:41.947 --> 29:43.414
Any idea where he'd go?

29:43.482 --> 29:45.450
No, I don't.

29:46.017 --> 29:47.382
Not anymore.

29:48.186 --> 29:49.483
I tried.

29:49.955 --> 29:51.786
I try with all my kids.

29:53.225 --> 29:56.319
Maybe, the two little ones,
they be okay.

29:58.163 --> 29:59.494
Anything else?

30:00.932 --> 30:02.058
No.

30:02.868 --> 30:04.426
Thank you for talking to me.

30:06.438 --> 30:08.269
Mister. Wait.

30:09.741 --> 30:13.370
If you find Sammy,
you do what you have to do.

30:16.882 --> 30:18.406
I understand.

30:28.427 --> 30:30.657
Sometimes being
a private investigator

30:30.729 --> 30:32.890
can be extremely frustrating.

30:33.465 --> 30:35.490
Especially when you do
everything by the book

30:35.567 --> 30:37.228
and still
nothing makes sense.

30:37.302 --> 30:40.066
No black, no white. Just gray.

30:40.639 --> 30:42.129
No happy ending.

30:43.041 --> 30:44.599
And the best you can do

30:44.676 --> 30:47.338
is try and keep the situation
from getting any worse.

30:47.412 --> 30:48.902
Like Sammy's mother.

30:51.783 --> 30:54.081
So, Sammy Garns
was now a dead-end,

30:54.219 --> 30:55.652
joining the black Lincoln,

30:55.720 --> 30:57.017
interviews with the witnesses

30:57.088 --> 30:58.646
and Ron Pennington Jr. himself

30:58.723 --> 31:00.452
as leads that didn't pan out.

31:01.793 --> 31:06.457
Like I said, being a private investigator
can be extremely frustrating.

31:07.032 --> 31:08.659
But never more
frustrating than

31:08.733 --> 31:11.531
when even though you know you've
done everything by the book,

31:11.603 --> 31:13.070
you also know
that the answer

31:13.138 --> 31:15.038
Iies somewhere
between the lines.

31:15.640 --> 31:18.666
The only thing is
you just can't quite see them.

31:18.743 --> 31:19.971
Hi, Higgins.

31:21.413 --> 31:23.040
Anything from Rick or T.C.?

31:23.114 --> 31:24.775
Unfortunately, no.

31:25.116 --> 31:27.346
At least not
in any positive sense.

31:27.853 --> 31:29.718
Rick did call an hour ago

31:29.788 --> 31:32.222
to say the chaps
at the chop-shop

31:32.390 --> 31:35.359
had no idea how to reach
the house boys

31:35.427 --> 31:36.985
who ditched the Continental.

31:37.062 --> 31:38.427
It's homeboys.

31:39.030 --> 31:41.794
Well, at least it looks like
you're making some headway.

31:42.467 --> 31:43.832
Yes, quite.

31:44.469 --> 31:48.428
Although, insignificant as it may
be considering what has occurred,

31:49.140 --> 31:52.041
however, it does provide
some mental relief

31:52.110 --> 31:55.443
in a way, if not
stimulation, actually.

31:56.264 --> 31:57.925
For instance,

31:58.166 --> 32:02.125
this book I'm perusing is Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle's A Study In Scarlet.

32:02.971 --> 32:05.269
As you know,
Holmes was the archetypical

32:05.340 --> 32:07.535
deductive private detective...

32:07.608 --> 32:08.905
Investigator.

32:09.444 --> 32:12.277
...who solved
the seemingly unsolvable plots

32:12.747 --> 32:15.648
by his comprehensive genius

32:16.050 --> 32:19.144
at discerning clues that
apparently did not exist.

32:19.487 --> 32:22.979
His was the consummate
deductive mind.

32:23.458 --> 32:24.789
He also talked funny.

32:25.326 --> 32:28.090
If you're referring to those silly
movies of the '40s that merely...

32:28.162 --> 32:30.096
Oh, come on, Higgins,
I liked those movies.

32:30.164 --> 32:31.927
I thought
Basil Rathbone was great.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.798
I just meant that he kind of talked...
Never mind.

32:34.869 --> 32:36.962
What's your point,
if you have one?

32:38.172 --> 32:41.630
On the other hand,
you have a detective

32:43.478 --> 32:46.174
Iike Chandler's Phillip Marlowe,
who plodded along,

32:46.247 --> 32:48.909
muddled in the most
incomprehensible plots.

32:49.283 --> 32:51.376
Chandler himself admitted
in his later years,

32:51.452 --> 32:54.148
that even he did not
understand The Long Goodbye.

32:54.989 --> 32:57.685
But nevertheless,
due to his acute sense of human nature,

32:57.759 --> 33:01.320
not only the "how" but the
"why" people do what they do,

33:02.463 --> 33:05.364
Marlowe was able to,
in the last chapter,

33:05.433 --> 33:07.298
finally confront the villain,

33:07.402 --> 33:10.530
even though we did not know
exactly how he got there.

33:11.906 --> 33:13.669
The point is he did.

33:15.376 --> 33:16.775
Where are you going?

33:16.844 --> 33:19.176
To test how acute
my sense of human nature is.

33:46.340 --> 33:49.605
I'm not really sure which
kind of private investigator I am.

33:49.677 --> 33:53.078
The Holmesian type with the
consummate deductive mind,

33:53.981 --> 33:56.472
or one with a Marlowe-type
intuitive sense

33:56.551 --> 33:58.280
of the darker side
of human nature.

33:58.352 --> 34:00.377
Hopefully,
a combination of both.

34:00.555 --> 34:02.284
At any rate,
it doesn't matter.

34:02.423 --> 34:04.288
Not when you have
a little voice.

34:04.358 --> 34:07.418
I don't know,
maybe a gently nagging little voice

34:07.495 --> 34:11.261
is really just another way of adding
what you know to what you feel.

34:12.033 --> 34:14.592
But right now,
mine wasn't gently nagging,

34:14.835 --> 34:16.235
it was screaming.

34:18.940 --> 34:20.168
Hello, Andy.

34:21.542 --> 34:22.770
Mr. Nguyen.

34:22.976 --> 34:24.034
Hello.

34:24.112 --> 34:25.409
Hello, Magnum.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.175
You've come to
visit your friend?

34:27.949 --> 34:30.042
No, actually, I came here
to see you.

34:30.118 --> 34:32.643
They told me down at the store
I'd find you here.

34:33.121 --> 34:35.487
Me?
Why do you want to see me?

34:37.859 --> 34:39.326
Oh, I think you know why.

34:41.596 --> 34:43.291
It was an accident,
wasn't it?

34:45.166 --> 34:46.895
Why didn't you
tell anybody?

34:48.168 --> 34:49.726
Because it was me.

34:51.639 --> 34:53.572
I shot your friend.

35:00.497 --> 35:01.794
They're surfers.

35:02.399 --> 35:04.128
Most of the drivers are.

35:06.804 --> 35:08.169
You ever try that?

35:09.340 --> 35:13.242
Once. Being inside a washing
machine is not my idea of sport.

35:15.746 --> 35:19.580
Anyway, Sammy goes up to Sunset on
the weekends when he's not working

35:19.650 --> 35:21.618
'cause Stu and Lee
have a shack up there.

35:21.885 --> 35:24.217
They surf, they get blitzed.

35:25.556 --> 35:26.921
You try that, too?

35:28.058 --> 35:29.457
Come on, T.C.

35:29.627 --> 35:31.891
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

35:32.129 --> 35:33.528
You're a man now.

35:33.597 --> 35:36.794
Don't ask you anything about
something you want to hide.

35:40.437 --> 35:42.598
I did that once or twice
with them, too.

35:43.707 --> 35:45.698
And, no,
I don't do it anymore.

35:46.777 --> 35:48.540
I mean they
kind of graduated.

35:49.246 --> 35:50.508
To what?

35:50.748 --> 35:51.976
Dust.

35:53.584 --> 35:55.950
Anyway, I gotta tell you, T.C.,
I don't know.

35:56.020 --> 35:59.478
I find it real hard to believe
it was them. I mean, real hard.

35:59.556 --> 36:00.750
Why?

36:01.725 --> 36:03.386
I mean, from what you said
they sound

36:03.460 --> 36:06.293
exactly like the two guys that
I saw running from the store.

36:07.097 --> 36:09.031
At least,
I intend to find out.

36:10.668 --> 36:12.101
And then what?

36:15.172 --> 36:17.970
I didn't know where else to turn,
Mr. Higgins. I'm sorry.

36:18.042 --> 36:20.237
Oh, please, don't be,
Mrs. Pennington.

36:20.310 --> 36:22.210
I'm very glad you came here.

36:22.446 --> 36:26.280
I'm sure Magnum is doing everything
he can to help right now as will l,

36:26.383 --> 36:29.443
even if it's only offering
a meager cup of tea.

36:29.620 --> 36:30.814
Thank you.

36:30.921 --> 36:33.981
It's just that Ron and T.C. took
off and haven't come back yet.

36:34.158 --> 36:37.252
And here was the only other place
I could think of to look for them.

36:37.327 --> 36:39.693
I've been looking
for T.C., too, and you.

36:40.030 --> 36:41.657
He's with Ron Jr.

36:41.965 --> 36:43.455
Yeah, I guess
T.C. did reach him.

36:43.934 --> 36:47.335
But then the both of them took off and
I think it was to go after those boys.

36:47.504 --> 36:49.062
That would be a real mistake.

36:49.173 --> 36:50.606
Of course it would.

36:50.708 --> 36:54.007
As much as we may sympathize with
their motives, vigilantism is...

36:54.078 --> 36:55.739
Absolutely irrelevant.

36:57.180 --> 36:58.841
I beg your pardon?

36:58.982 --> 37:00.882
Those three kids
didn't kill Ron.

37:03.787 --> 37:06.119
The store owner did.
The boy's father.

37:06.390 --> 37:07.857
How do you know that?

37:08.425 --> 37:10.484
I've just been wondering
why this old man

37:10.560 --> 37:13.654
who'd been robbed so many
times would try to fight off

37:13.730 --> 37:15.493
three armed robbers
with his bare hands.

37:15.565 --> 37:20.127
I mean, it didn't figure. Why wouldn't he
keep the gun in the cash register drawer?

37:20.337 --> 37:23.135
And then they were so
solicitous after the incident.

37:23.407 --> 37:25.375
What you are saying, Magnum,
is that Mr. Pennington

37:25.442 --> 37:27.467
was the unfortunate victim
of circumstance.

37:27.711 --> 37:30.737
Why then did they not go to
the police and tell them this?

37:30.814 --> 37:34.545
Maybe they're not familiar with delicate
legal phrases like accidental shooting.

37:34.618 --> 37:37.644
The boy was probably afraid they'd
send his father back to Vietnam.

37:37.721 --> 37:40.747
So he just threw the gun away
and blamed it on the robbers.

37:41.358 --> 37:44.054
So then Ron and T.C.
are going after innocent boys.

37:44.127 --> 37:46.618
Not entirely innocent.
They're still armed robbers.

37:47.464 --> 37:49.955
The question is,
what can we do to stop them?

37:50.067 --> 37:52.001
Do you have any idea
where they're heading?

37:52.069 --> 37:53.229
No.

37:55.772 --> 37:57.137
The police?
No.

37:57.240 --> 37:59.208
That would be worse
for Ron and T.C.

37:59.443 --> 38:00.705
Well, who are you calling?

38:01.878 --> 38:03.971
Come on, Magnum,
give me a break, brah.

38:04.047 --> 38:06.447
I got a major disaster
on my hands here.

38:07.350 --> 38:09.181
A what? What?

38:09.786 --> 38:12.812
I'll tell you what. In addition
to Ron Pennington not showing up,

38:12.889 --> 38:14.948
and that sleaze ball
Sammy Garns,

38:15.025 --> 38:18.188
I got two more drivers
stiffing me. Flu.

38:19.596 --> 38:21.291
Yeah, yeah,
I'll tell you where.

38:21.364 --> 38:22.558
And when you're
through with them,

38:22.632 --> 38:25.192
maybe you can come down
and pedal a cab for me, huh?

38:39.950 --> 38:41.349
That's it.

38:59.803 --> 39:03.034
Stu and Lee crash here.
Sammy comes by sometimes.

39:03.974 --> 39:05.066
Okay.

39:07.878 --> 39:10.210
Okay, I want you to wait here.
I'll be right back.

39:10.280 --> 39:12.339
Wait a second.
Uh-uh. You wait a second.

39:12.415 --> 39:14.144
I want to go check
this place out first.

39:14.217 --> 39:16.845
Look, T.C., these guys are,
like, totally dusted.

39:16.920 --> 39:20.151
You know, like, space,
the final frontier? Maybe l...

39:20.223 --> 39:22.214
Hold it, hold it,
hold it right there.

39:22.292 --> 39:24.351
Now, I know exactly
what you're going to say.

39:24.427 --> 39:26.657
But I am not gonna
blindly walk in there.

39:26.730 --> 39:28.721
I mean, there're no cars
parked around here,

39:28.798 --> 39:31.289
that probably means
that there's nobody inside.

39:31.868 --> 39:35.304
Now, I just want to simply sneak
up there, check the place out,

39:35.739 --> 39:37.730
and after we're certain
that they've been there,

39:37.807 --> 39:40.640
then I'm gonna send you to call
the cops and I'll wait for them.

39:40.710 --> 39:41.802
Okay?

39:41.878 --> 39:43.539
That's not what l
was going to say.

39:44.314 --> 39:45.804
What were you going to say?

39:46.550 --> 39:47.915
Well, um,

39:49.052 --> 39:51.680
all the way up here I
thought you were gonna go off

39:51.755 --> 39:54.349
half-crazy because of
some weird sense of guilt.

39:54.457 --> 39:57.858
I mean, because you didn't go in the
store and get the Gatorade yourself.

39:58.628 --> 40:01.119
But then I was thinking about
how that would be the most

40:01.198 --> 40:03.098
absolutely stupid thing
you could do.

40:04.367 --> 40:08.201
After knowing you and
especially after talking to you

40:08.572 --> 40:11.166
and hearing you talk to Mom
over the last couple of days,

40:12.542 --> 40:15.136
I know you wouldn't do
anything emotionally that dumb.

40:16.479 --> 40:19.175
So, um, what I was
gonna say was

40:20.417 --> 40:21.543
good luck.

40:24.588 --> 40:26.021
I'll be right back.

41:11.668 --> 41:13.295
T.C.: Sammy sent me.

41:14.237 --> 41:15.761
You looking to
score some dust, man?

41:15.839 --> 41:17.534
Yeah, yeah,
I want some dust.

41:18.942 --> 41:20.375
Powder or sticks?

41:20.744 --> 41:21.904
Powder.

41:22.412 --> 41:23.709
How much?

41:24.881 --> 41:25.870
Uh...

41:26.316 --> 41:27.647
Couple of ounces.

41:29.552 --> 41:31.884
You're a narc.
You're a freaking narc.

41:31.955 --> 41:33.445
No, no, no. Calm down, man.
I'm not a narc.

41:33.523 --> 41:35.047
I just want...
I am not a narc!

41:35.125 --> 41:37.855
Hey, I am here because
you and your buddy

41:37.961 --> 41:39.861
robbed a grocery store
last Saturday

41:40.430 --> 41:43.058
and you killed my friend and
you are going to the police.

41:43.133 --> 41:44.361
Hey, man.

41:44.567 --> 41:47.365
Now, go wake
that punk up.

41:47.437 --> 41:49.564
Hey, look, we didn't kill him.
Now, come on, I'll wake him up!

41:49.639 --> 41:51.300
Hey, look,
that old dude shot him.

41:51.374 --> 41:53.205
He just picked up
the gun and whaled out.

41:53.276 --> 41:54.937
Too hyper,
you know what I mean?

41:55.011 --> 41:57.275
Look, let's talk this over
or something.

41:57.347 --> 41:58.609
You get high?

41:58.682 --> 42:00.809
Hey, man,
my friend was killed

42:00.984 --> 42:03.418
because you robbed a store.

42:04.154 --> 42:07.180
In the eyes of the law and
God you are as guilty as hell

42:07.257 --> 42:08.690
and you are going!

44:19.689 --> 44:21.088
Hey, cool out, man.

44:22.659 --> 44:24.024
Let them go.

44:24.093 --> 44:25.321
And then what?

44:25.395 --> 44:29.058
Then we hop into these wheels
and we drop Ronnie off someplace.

44:29.699 --> 44:31.929
Hey, no worry.
He gonna be okay.

44:32.969 --> 44:35.494
Besides, I told him,

44:35.572 --> 44:37.199
we ain't murderers.

44:38.608 --> 44:40.200
Let them go.

44:47.984 --> 44:50.919
And, brah, don't even think
about following us.

44:54.557 --> 44:55.819
No problem.

44:55.892 --> 44:58.759
Hey, Ronnie, when they drop you off,
you call Magnum.

44:59.863 --> 45:01.228
He'll pick you up.

45:16.012 --> 45:17.445
Hi, guys.

45:58.922 --> 46:00.549
Nice game, guys, thanks.

46:02.492 --> 46:03.686
Yeah, thanks, guys.

46:03.826 --> 46:05.259
Go easy on us next time, huh?
- Hey, Bert.

46:05.862 --> 46:08.831
Yo, thanks, Bert.
Hey, see you guys next week.

46:09.032 --> 46:10.192
T.C.: Bert,
good luck at the club tonight.
