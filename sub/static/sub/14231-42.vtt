11:08.918 --> 11:12.881
Something certainly
smells funny about this.

11:12.964 --> 11:16.009
That doesn't matter to Goofy, cashew.

11:16.092 --> 11:17.427
He'll eat it anyway.

11:21.973 --> 11:23.433
26...

11:23.516 --> 11:24.476
27...

11:24.559 --> 11:25.518
Attaboy, Pop!

11:25.602 --> 11:28.021
Remember--
food is your friend.

11:30.982 --> 11:34.319
Oh, brains and good-lookin', too.

11:34.402 --> 11:36.696
No wonder my mama loved me.

11:36.780 --> 11:39.491
Ha ha! Oh, Pete.

11:39.574 --> 11:41.451
You can do it, Mr. G.

11:41.534 --> 11:42.827
Don't quit now, Dad!

11:42.911 --> 11:44.371
Go, go, go!

11:44.454 --> 11:46.331
[panting]

11:49.209 --> 11:53.588
Oh. All this trainin' is enough to wear
a guy out.

11:55.382 --> 11:56.466
[creaking]

11:56.549 --> 11:58.677
[Pete] Pull!

11:58.760 --> 11:59.928
Got it!

12:01.221 --> 12:02.847
Ready, boys?

12:04.432 --> 12:06.393
All set, Mr Pete.

12:06.476 --> 12:07.644
[Pete] Pull!

12:09.896 --> 12:11.523
Got it!

12:11.606 --> 12:12.691
[Pete]
Pull!

12:12.774 --> 12:13.983
[Goofy] Got it!

12:14.067 --> 12:16.861
That's what I call fast food.

12:16.945 --> 12:21.825
Yes. I better find out what ol' jelly
doughnut is up to

12:21.908 --> 12:23.493
before it goes too much farther.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.163
[Goofy groaning]

12:31.251 --> 12:33.378
Gosh, Dad, are you all right?

12:33.461 --> 12:36.006
All right? Of course he's all right.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.091
Can't wait to train
tomorrow, can you, Goof?

12:38.174 --> 12:40.385
Well, I guess.

12:41.553 --> 12:42.846
That's all very well,

12:42.929 --> 12:45.390
but what are you gonna do for him
in the meantime?

12:45.682 --> 12:48.351
For him? I'm too busy doin' it to him--

12:48.435 --> 12:51.688
uh, I mean with him--
to do anything for him.

12:51.771 --> 12:55.025
You owe Goofy something nice
for all the work he's done.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.861
OK, OK. Whaddaya got in mind?

12:57.944 --> 13:00.905
I don't know. What would you like, Goofy?

13:00.989 --> 13:03.074
Well, I am kinda hungry.

13:03.158 --> 13:05.160
[together] Hungry?

13:05.243 --> 13:07.704
He ain't humanitary.

13:10.498 --> 13:13.835
[Goofy] This here's my favorite
place for a quick snack.

13:14.002 --> 13:16.379
I love this joint.

13:16.755 --> 13:17.714
[sniffing]

13:18.048 --> 13:19.549
Smell that cookin'!

13:20.467 --> 13:23.511
I've smelled gym socks more appetizing.

13:23.595 --> 13:25.722
It smells simply...

13:25.805 --> 13:29.809
Out of this world, Goofy.
Thank you for sharing.

13:29.893 --> 13:32.187
Wait till you meet Myron.

13:32.270 --> 13:33.772
What's a Myron?

13:33.897 --> 13:35.106
[Myron] Goofy!

13:35.982 --> 13:38.818
Long time no feed, Goofy.

13:38.902 --> 13:43.239
Oh! Oh, my, he's a big boy.

13:43.323 --> 13:46.451
You gotta be big to get away with
wearin' that apron.

13:46.534 --> 13:48.578
This is Peg.

13:50.372 --> 13:51.998
Enchante.

13:52.082 --> 13:53.291
Oh! Ha ha!

13:53.375 --> 13:55.794
Oh, you're right, Goofy.

13:55.877 --> 13:57.712
This guy really cooks.

13:57.796 --> 14:01.007
Hyuck! This is my best friend, Pete.

14:01.091 --> 14:05.845
Say, don't you know me
from someplace, Myron?

14:05.929 --> 14:07.222
You like wrestling?

14:07.305 --> 14:08.139
Love it.

14:09.683 --> 14:11.518
Oh! Unh!

14:11.601 --> 14:14.771
Then you've never seen me
before in your life.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.691
Hmm. Myron, huh?

14:18.274 --> 14:19.651
Special of the day--

14:19.859 --> 14:21.152
nuclear chili.

14:21.236 --> 14:22.862
Is this stuff safe?

14:22.946 --> 14:25.532
As long as you don't
spill any in your lap.

14:25.615 --> 14:28.535
This stuff always needs a little pepper.

14:28.618 --> 14:30.620
Goofy, no! Not pepper!

14:30.704 --> 14:31.871
Ah...

14:31.955 --> 14:33.581
Ah...

14:33.707 --> 14:34.874
Ah...

14:35.250 --> 14:37.002
Ah...

14:37.085 --> 14:39.754
Choo!

14:41.923 --> 14:44.968
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

14:45.051 --> 14:48.054
Aah!

14:48.138 --> 14:50.807
Ha ha ha!

14:50.890 --> 14:54.102
Peter has a problem with too much pepper.

14:54.185 --> 14:55.812
I noticed.

14:55.895 --> 14:59.232
Guess we better
get dessert to go. Ah-hyuck!

15:02.402 --> 15:03.862
[Goofy]
Thanks for the dinner.

15:03.945 --> 15:06.990
You deserved it, didn't he, Peter?

15:07.073 --> 15:08.158
Yeah, deserved.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.368
The children and I can't wait

15:10.452 --> 15:11.995
to see you and Pete in action.

15:12.912 --> 15:17.334
Oh, golly, Pegster,
I forgot to tell you.

15:17.417 --> 15:20.003
No female women girl-types or rugrats

15:20.086 --> 15:23.673
are allowed at this
manly-type competition.

15:23.757 --> 15:26.343
Oh, Peter, you're such a fooler!

15:26.426 --> 15:29.179
I've already reserved
front row seats.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.764
Isn't that marvelous?

15:30.847 --> 15:32.223
Nighty-night.

15:32.307 --> 15:33.725
Front row seats!

15:33.808 --> 15:36.227
That's swell, huh, Petey?

15:36.311 --> 15:37.854
Oh, yeah.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.439
That's just peachy.

15:45.236 --> 15:47.572
[Pistol]
And in this corner,

15:47.655 --> 15:51.034
the Incredible Bulk's
worst nightmare--

15:51.117 --> 15:53.078
Roadkill!

15:53.161 --> 15:54.913
Well, I must say

15:54.996 --> 15:56.956
you've never looked more "Pete"
in your life.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.041
Do you like it, sir?

15:58.124 --> 15:59.793
We stayed up all night

15:59.876 --> 16:01.044
making it for you, Daddy.

16:01.127 --> 16:03.129
Well, it sure...

16:03.213 --> 16:06.257
Itches more than anything I've ever worn.

16:06.341 --> 16:08.134
Don't be silly, Peter.

16:08.218 --> 16:11.262
The suit doesn't itch. You do.

16:11.346 --> 16:14.265
[panting] You guys
aren't gonna believe this!

16:14.349 --> 16:17.977
Presenting the scourge
of convenience stores

16:18.061 --> 16:19.813
the world over,

16:19.896 --> 16:21.981
Goofy, the Golden Gullet.

16:22.065 --> 16:23.233
Ah-hyuck!

16:23.316 --> 16:25.402
How do I look?

16:25.485 --> 16:26.861
Goofy, is that you?

16:26.945 --> 16:30.198
Where'd you get all the
squishy muscles, Mr. G?

16:30.281 --> 16:32.117
These aren't muscles, Pistol.

16:32.200 --> 16:33.952
These are my snack reserves

16:34.035 --> 16:37.038
in case I get hungry
between rounds. Ah-hyuck!

16:40.792 --> 16:42.836
[announcer]
Ladies and gentlemen,

16:42.919 --> 16:46.381
the moment you've been
waiting for has arrived.

16:46.464 --> 16:50.051
I guess the eating contest
comes after the wrestling.

16:50.135 --> 16:51.344
Yeah. Must be.

16:52.012 --> 16:54.431
Wonder where they keep the food.

16:54.514 --> 16:55.974
Don't worry, Goof.

16:56.057 --> 16:59.227
You'll get your fill of this in no time.

16:59.310 --> 17:00.979
[announcer]
In this corner,

17:01.062 --> 17:03.481
the finest wrestler on the planet earth--

17:03.565 --> 17:07.110
the Incredible Bulk Brogan!

17:07.193 --> 17:08.278
[cheering]

17:08.361 --> 17:10.030
Boo! Hiss!

17:10.113 --> 17:11.823
Throw the bum out!

17:11.906 --> 17:14.325
My daddy's gonna kick tail!

17:14.409 --> 17:15.702
And the challenger...

17:16.619 --> 17:19.664
Oh, Pete, this is so exciting.

17:19.748 --> 17:22.042
Goofy!

17:22.125 --> 17:23.418
-Goofy?
-Goofy?

17:23.501 --> 17:25.420
Hey, that's me.

17:25.503 --> 17:29.883
Go on, Goof. I guess they're gonna
start with you.

17:29.966 --> 17:31.551
Okey-doke.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.973
This'll teach him to eat me outta house
and hamsters.

17:37.057 --> 17:39.434
Pete, what's going on?

17:39.517 --> 17:40.727
I don't know, soup bone.

17:40.810 --> 17:42.562
Goofy's gonna straighten it out.

17:44.189 --> 17:45.398
Here I come!

17:47.233 --> 17:48.193
Oopsie!

17:48.276 --> 17:49.986
Ah-hyuck.

17:50.070 --> 17:51.404
Whoa!

17:53.782 --> 17:56.076
Oh, I knew you were up to no good!

17:56.159 --> 17:57.744
Don't you realize your best friend

17:57.827 --> 18:00.538
is gonna be ground into dog food?

18:00.622 --> 18:01.706
Jeepers, Pegums.

18:01.790 --> 18:04.376
Somebody musta... Goofed!

18:04.417 --> 18:06.044
Heh heh ha ha!

18:06.127 --> 18:07.045
Goofy?

18:07.128 --> 18:08.755
Is that you, Myron?

18:08.838 --> 18:11.800
Ah-hyuck! So this is your day job.

18:11.883 --> 18:14.386
Wait--wait just a minute!

18:14.469 --> 18:16.262
You promised to wrestle

18:16.346 --> 18:18.014
till you lost fair and square,

18:18.098 --> 18:21.101
so wrestle already, you big cheater.

18:21.184 --> 18:23.144
Sorry, Goofy. I'm gonna have to beat

18:23.228 --> 18:25.105
the living daylights out of you.

18:25.188 --> 18:26.773
It's the right thing to do.

18:26.940 --> 18:30.735
Oh, uh, well, OK, I guess. Whoa!

18:31.027 --> 18:34.364
The Bulk has Goofy in
his famous brisket squeeze.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.783
Looks bad for the challenger.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.244
But Goofy escapes

18:39.327 --> 18:41.121
with the old pie-in-your-pants dodge.

18:41.204 --> 18:42.455
What a move!

18:42.539 --> 18:44.124
Huh? Uh-oh!

18:44.207 --> 18:46.126
Shoe's untied, Myron.

18:46.209 --> 18:47.877
Yeow!

18:47.961 --> 18:49.421
[all] Awesome!

18:49.504 --> 18:51.006
Ouch!

18:51.089 --> 18:53.174
Ooh!

18:53.258 --> 18:54.718
Oh, stop fussing.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.178
Untied shoes can be dangerous.

18:57.262 --> 18:58.972
Do you understand me?

18:59.055 --> 19:01.182
If you don't help Goofy
right this minute,

19:01.266 --> 19:03.101
you'll be moving in
with Chainsaw tonight.

19:03.727 --> 19:04.728
What the...

19:04.811 --> 19:07.063
He's beatin' the Bulk.

19:07.147 --> 19:09.774
Hold still a sec, will you, Myron?

19:09.858 --> 19:11.234
Myron?

19:11.317 --> 19:15.280
Hey, it's that apron guy from the diner.

19:15.363 --> 19:17.115
Stand aside, Peg.

19:17.198 --> 19:20.285
I must assist my staunch companion.

19:20.368 --> 19:21.786
Say what?

19:21.870 --> 19:25.457
I always knew wrestlin'
was a bunch of hooey.

19:26.041 --> 19:27.876
I'm gonna be famous,

19:27.959 --> 19:29.586
a whole new career--

19:29.669 --> 19:32.714
Roadkill Pete, wrestling champ
of the planet.

19:32.881 --> 19:35.175
Oh, hiya, Petey.

19:35.592 --> 19:37.844
Run along, Goofster. Have a little snack.

19:37.927 --> 19:39.220
I'll handle this.

19:39.304 --> 19:41.389
I am a professional, you know.

19:41.473 --> 19:43.224
OK, Myron,

19:43.308 --> 19:46.853
time to make you my blue-plate
special of the day.

19:46.936 --> 19:48.813
Hyah!

19:48.897 --> 19:51.149
Ooh! Ahh!

19:51.232 --> 19:52.192
Mmm!

19:52.275 --> 19:53.610
Ooh! Whatta!

19:53.693 --> 19:56.154
Hookah! Why, I--

19:56.237 --> 19:57.197
Ooh! Hyah!

19:57.280 --> 19:59.574
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

19:59.657 --> 20:01.034
[panting]

20:01.117 --> 20:02.660
Uh-oh!

20:02.744 --> 20:06.122
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!

20:06.206 --> 20:09.250
[commentator]
Oh, no! It's the cake-mix spin.

20:09.668 --> 20:11.336
Attaboy, Petey.

20:11.795 --> 20:13.672
Wear him down. Ah-hyuck!

20:13.797 --> 20:15.965
Ooh! Ow! Ooh!

20:16.049 --> 20:18.385
That's my favorite spine!

20:19.886 --> 20:23.306
Now it's the peppermint twist.

20:23.390 --> 20:25.308
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!

20:25.392 --> 20:26.851
Looks like the end, folks.

20:26.935 --> 20:29.270
The Bulk's got him in the stuffed
chicken wing--

20:29.354 --> 20:31.856
a hold that has never been broken.

20:31.940 --> 20:33.441
I think he's had enough, Myron.

20:33.525 --> 20:35.860
I know, but I was hoping he'd beat me

20:35.944 --> 20:39.197
so I could quit this business
and run my diner in peace.

20:39.280 --> 20:41.032
I got an idea.

20:42.325 --> 20:44.327
Well, I do.

20:47.247 --> 20:49.124
This oughta pepper you up.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.876
Ah...

20:51.960 --> 20:53.378
Ah...

20:53.461 --> 20:56.006
-Uh-oh!
-Ah-choo!

20:57.048 --> 20:59.217
Ah-choo!

20:59.843 --> 21:01.094
He's pinned the Bulk.

21:01.177 --> 21:03.263
He wins! He wins!

21:03.471 --> 21:05.265
[spectators applauding]

21:06.016 --> 21:06.891
Well?

21:07.392 --> 21:09.144
Aren't you even gonna apologize to Goofy?

21:09.561 --> 21:14.524
Apologize?
I helped him do his friend a favor.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.234
I'm a hero, see?

21:16.317 --> 21:19.237
Hey, Roadkill! What are you
doing sitting around?

21:19.320 --> 21:20.572
You got work to do.

21:20.655 --> 21:21.740
What work?

21:21.823 --> 21:23.283
That work.

21:23.366 --> 21:26.036
Those are the Bulk's other challengers.

21:26.119 --> 21:28.872
You beat the Bulk, you fight them.

21:28.955 --> 21:30.206
Says who?

21:30.290 --> 21:34.044
