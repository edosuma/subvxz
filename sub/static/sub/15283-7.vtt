00:05.950 --> 00:07.470
Get 'em-- morgan,
get 'em off me!

00:07.490 --> 00:09.040
Reid. Reid. Wake up.

00:09.070 --> 00:10.660
What the hell is scaring you?

00:10.680 --> 00:12.310
The name Riley Jenkins
mean anything to you?

00:12.330 --> 00:12.840
No.

00:12.850 --> 00:15.170
He was murdered right here in
las vegas when he was 6 years old.

00:15.180 --> 00:16.570
you would have been
around 4 at the time.

00:16.600 --> 00:19.240
He was found him in the basement
of his own house, behind the dryer.

00:19.250 --> 00:21.960
He'd been sexually abused and stabbed.

00:22.500 --> 00:24.760
Spencer? What are you doing here?

00:24.780 --> 00:27.420
Did i know a boy named riley jenkins?

00:27.430 --> 00:31.380
I've been having dreams about
his death since i was little.

00:32.369 --> 00:34.510
Why aren't you helping me?

00:34.520 --> 00:36.380
Spencer,pay attention.

00:36.400 --> 00:38.830
Show me your face.

00:39.760 --> 00:41.610
Dad.

00:42.430 --> 00:45.100
<i>{\a6}LAS VEGAS.NEVADA</i>

00:43.140 --> 00:46.110
Come on,baby. Give it to me.
Give it to me. See? Nuh-uh.

00:46.120 --> 00:49.750
Morgan,can you--
Please,can you-- My head.

00:49.760 --> 00:51.480
My bad. Sorry.

00:51.490 --> 00:54.290
You know these things are rigged,right?

00:54.890 --> 00:55.980
Late night?

00:56.000 --> 00:56.990
I hate vegas.

00:57.010 --> 00:58.380
Come on,prentiss. How
can you hate vegas?

00:58.390 --> 01:00.180
This is a grown folk's playground.

01:00.220 --> 01:01.350
Anyone seen Reid?

01:01.360 --> 01:02.700
I know he stayed with
his mom last night.

01:02.720 --> 01:05.170
Well,he should be here by now.
He knows the departure time.

01:05.180 --> 01:06.560
That thing still has credit on it.

01:06.580 --> 01:09.840
- J.J.,i swear
to god-- - What?

01:13.580 --> 01:14.830
Oh,here he comes right now.

01:14.850 --> 01:16.190
What'd you do? Sleep through your alarm?

01:16.200 --> 01:17.500
Sorry to keep you
guys waiting. I--

01:17.510 --> 01:19.750
Hotch is already at the
airstrip. How fast can you pack?

01:19.760 --> 01:22.390
Actually,i'm gonna stay
for a couple of days.

01:22.420 --> 01:23.290
Is everything all right?

01:23.300 --> 01:27.740
Yeah,i just,um-- I haven't seen my mom for a
really long time, so i'd like a few more days.

01:27.750 --> 01:29.230
- You sure?
- Yeah.

01:29.240 --> 01:32.450
Ok,take a few days.
Do what you need to do.

01:38.120 --> 01:41.000
Hey,um,take care of yourself.

01:41.010 --> 01:44.230
You,too. Both of you.

Hi,i'm special agent
spencer Reid, with the fbi.

01:56.530 --> 02:01.440
I'd like to see everything you have on the
1984 murder of a boy named riley jenkins.

02:01.470 --> 02:04.090
- Just a second.
- Thanks.

02:08.400 --> 02:09.830
That was a rough one.

02:09.840 --> 02:11.190
Did you work the case?

02:11.220 --> 02:15.500
Yeah. I was 3 or 4 blocks away
when the call came in on the radio.

02:15.840 --> 02:17.410
My first kid.

02:17.420 --> 02:18.800
You don't forget those.

02:18.820 --> 02:20.960
Can i ask you this?
Were there any suspects?

02:20.970 --> 02:23.980
The family, initially.
A dad,an older brother.

02:23.990 --> 02:26.780
Makes sense. I heard the boy was
found in his own basement,right?

02:26.790 --> 02:30.820
Yeah. After a while,the family
got defensive, stopped cooperating.

02:30.830 --> 02:35.160
A bit like the-- what's her
name? The jon-benet case, i guess.

02:35.170 --> 02:36.880
I never liked them for it,anyway.

02:36.900 --> 02:40.290
I always figured it was
somebody outside the home.

02:41.900 --> 02:43.440
What's the bureau's
interest in the case?

02:43.460 --> 02:46.350
Um,research.

02:46.360 --> 02:47.650
Is this everything?

02:47.670 --> 02:49.480
There might be another
box down in records.

02:49.500 --> 02:52.660
I'd like to see it
all, if you don't mind.

03:01.120 --> 03:03.840
Lots of luck,everybody, let's go.

03:08.600 --> 03:10.850
nice shot!

03:27.250 --> 03:28.780
when did you know?

03:28.790 --> 03:30.130
that's it?

03:30.140 --> 03:31.420
That the extent of you...

03:31.450 --> 03:32.560
What are you guys doing here?

03:32.580 --> 03:35.420
Hey,what's it look like we're doing?

03:35.430 --> 03:38.780
Uh,breaking into my room and
watching "days of our lives."

03:38.790 --> 03:40.240
"young and the restless."

03:40.260 --> 03:42.280
aren't you supposed to be
on a plane back to d. C. ?

03:42.290 --> 03:44.470
You're supposed to be
hanging out with your mom.

03:44.480 --> 03:47.040
And you're not.

03:47.790 --> 03:48.650
Riley jenkins?

03:48.660 --> 03:50.730
No,it's not-- that's
actually not why i'm here.

03:50.740 --> 03:52.510
Reid?

03:52.520 --> 03:54.400
Come on,man.

03:54.410 --> 03:57.090
Who do you think you're talking to?

03:57.950 --> 04:00.100
I know what this has been doing to you.

04:00.120 --> 04:01.500
Let us help.

04:01.510 --> 04:05.350
Maybe together we can
find out who killed him.

04:06.170 --> 04:07.780
I think i might already know.

04:07.790 --> 04:09.740
So,tell us about the suspect.

04:09.750 --> 04:13.660
Truth is,i don't know
anything about him.

04:14.620 --> 04:16.529
He's my father.

FReidrich nietzsche.

05:00.060 --> 05:03.140
Before we go down this
road, you need to be sure.

05:03.170 --> 05:03.920
He's right.

05:03.950 --> 05:06.560
Some rocks don't need looking under.

05:06.570 --> 05:09.600
My mind is sending me signals.
I can't ignore them anymore.

05:09.610 --> 05:10.680
Mixed signals.

05:10.710 --> 05:13.490
That's what the subconscious
is all about, you know that.

05:13.510 --> 05:14.940
Reid,your dad left you.

05:14.950 --> 05:18.440
You take it to the freudian extreme, you
could say that he killed your childhood.

05:18.460 --> 05:21.650
Could explain a dream in which
you see him as a murderer.

05:21.700 --> 05:24.910
I've come this far, i'm not going back.

05:24.940 --> 05:27.140
Ok,thank you.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.290
Emily,you rember agent Todd?

05:29.300 --> 05:31.130
Oh,yeah. Welcome back. Thanks.

05:31.140 --> 05:33.470
I'll be shadowing J.J. For
the next couple of weeks.

05:33.480 --> 05:34.980
Big shoes to fill.

05:34.990 --> 05:36.770
Big ankles, at least.

05:36.780 --> 05:38.140
Come on,you look great.

05:38.150 --> 05:39.700
That's what i keep telling her.

05:39.720 --> 05:40.890
Do you have
kids, too?Or--

05:40.900 --> 05:44.990
ah,no. I think J.J. May have
snared the last viable donor.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.560
Tell me about it.

05:46.570 --> 05:47.930
Donor for what?

05:47.950 --> 05:48.500
Nothing.

05:48.510 --> 05:51.780
I'm just,uh, reacquainting
agent Todd here with the layout.

05:51.790 --> 05:53.540
Good to see you again,
S. S. A. Hotchner.

05:53.550 --> 05:54.820
No,please. "Hotch."

05:54.830 --> 05:57.110
Hotch. So,where's the rest of the team?

05:57.120 --> 06:01.000
Oh,another case came up while we were in las
vegas,and they stayed behind to look into it.

06:01.010 --> 06:02.970
Excuse me.

06:02.980 --> 06:06.180
I thought you work cases together.

06:06.190 --> 06:08.110
This one's different.

06:08.120 --> 06:09.350
Riley was 6 at the time.

06:09.370 --> 06:12.800
His father, lou jenkins, was supposed
to pick him up from t-ball practice at 4.

06:12.820 --> 06:15.680
But he got delayed at work, prompting
riley to walk the 3 blocks home.

06:15.710 --> 06:18.680
When his mother got home in the early
evening, she found him dead in the basement.

06:18.700 --> 06:22.030
So,the offender came to the
house after the boy arrived home.

06:22.050 --> 06:23.610
Or picked him up on the way there.

06:23.630 --> 06:26.300
Coaxes riley into the basement
where he sexually assaults him.

06:26.310 --> 06:28.160
The boy's mouth was taped shut.

06:28.180 --> 06:29.060
Symbolic.

06:29.070 --> 06:32.000
The unsub fears riley will talk,
panics,weighs his options...

06:32.020 --> 06:33.870
Decides to make certain
that he'll never talk.

06:33.880 --> 06:36.560
He finds a knife in the
fishing gear under the stairs,

06:36.570 --> 06:42.340
Stabs riley 9 times in the chest,
stuffs him behind the washing machine.

06:43.230 --> 06:46.930
So,the unsub's a white male
in his late 20s to early 30s.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.690
Means we're looking
for a man in his 50s.

06:48.710 --> 06:49.980
Likely knew the boy.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.210
Maybe been to his house.

06:51.220 --> 06:53.380
Neighbor.

06:55.010 --> 06:56.880
Reid? What is it?

06:56.890 --> 06:59.430
My family lived less than a
half mile from the jenkins'.

06:59.440 --> 07:01.110
Do you think your dad knew the boy?

07:01.120 --> 07:02.330
I don't know.

07:02.350 --> 07:07.560
My memory's lack of recall just
reinforces how little i knew about him.

07:08.240 --> 07:09.770
Reid,we're going to
have to track him down.

07:09.780 --> 07:10.610
You do know that?

07:10.680 --> 07:13.530
We should talk to my
mother first, neighbors.

07:13.550 --> 07:15.200
Get their impressions.

07:15.220 --> 07:20.900
Reid,i don't need to tell you that this
signature was need-based and sexual in nature.

07:20.910 --> 07:24.390
The man we're looking
for is a pedophile.

07:24.400 --> 07:27.380
So,i'll ask you again.

07:27.400 --> 07:31.500
Are you sure you want
to go down this road?

07:35.710 --> 07:40.530
Mom? Can i ask you some
questions about dad?

07:40.540 --> 07:44.660
I'm having... Having
trouble remembering.

07:44.670 --> 07:47.720
What do you want to know?

07:47.730 --> 07:49.780
Did he like to be around children?

07:49.790 --> 07:51.870
Children?

07:51.880 --> 07:52.960
Well,yes.

07:52.970 --> 07:55.710
If it were up to him, you'd have a
house full of brothers and sisters.

07:55.720 --> 07:58.600
So,you didn't want more kids?

07:58.610 --> 08:01.150
Why mess with perfection?

08:04.190 --> 08:08.460
Um, what about other people's children?

08:08.470 --> 08:10.410
How was he around them?

08:10.420 --> 08:12.630
He was good with kids,i guess.

08:12.640 --> 08:14.360
He coached your little league team.

08:14.380 --> 08:18.210
Good hit. Yeah!

08:18.220 --> 08:19.660
Hey,good hit, riley.

08:19.670 --> 08:23.430
Spencer, you're next.

08:23.440 --> 08:26.740
He was always trying to put
you into normal activities.

08:26.750 --> 08:28.990
I tried to tell him you're not normal.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.110
You were exceptional.

08:32.419 --> 08:34.890
Let me ask you this,mom.

08:34.900 --> 08:39.260
Did you ever get the feeling,
like,on his part, the marriage was...

08:39.270 --> 08:40.780
Just for show?

08:40.789 --> 08:43.179
These questions are
very strange, spencer.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.890
What is this about?

08:45.900 --> 08:47.410
It's about riley jenkins.

08:47.420 --> 08:48.340
Riley jenkins?

08:48.350 --> 08:50.060
I told you, he was someone you made up.

08:50.070 --> 08:51.610
No,he's not someone i made up.

08:51.630 --> 08:56.040
He was a real boy who lived in our
neighborhood, and somebody killed him.

08:56.050 --> 09:02.150
And,i don't know,i think-- i think that
dad might have had something to do with it.

09:02.820 --> 09:03.840
He was real?

09:03.850 --> 09:06.060
Yes. And...

09:07.330 --> 09:10.880
He was on that little league team,too.

09:11.770 --> 09:14.610
So many cases. How do you
determine which ones get priority?

09:14.620 --> 09:17.230
Ah,basically murder triage.

09:17.250 --> 09:21.910
I look for cases where the threat of
losing another life is most imminent.

09:21.920 --> 09:24.500
Without the other agents
giving you a working profile?

09:24.530 --> 09:25.810
Well,that comes later.

09:25.830 --> 09:28.420
This job does require a
little bit of profiling.

09:28.440 --> 09:31.050
Just don't tell them that.

09:31.070 --> 09:33.190
Here, let me show you.

09:33.200 --> 09:39.440
Ok,family in atlanta,mother, twin
daughters, stabbed in their sleep,and,uh...

09:39.470 --> 09:40.840
Yeah,sioux city, iowa.

09:40.850 --> 09:46.600
Two men with no apparent connection both found
drowned in their bathtub exactly one month apart.

09:46.610 --> 09:47.470
Where would you go?

09:47.500 --> 09:48.710
I'd have to take a closer look.

09:48.720 --> 09:51.050
What does your gut tell you?

09:53.110 --> 09:55.870
Sioux city looks like a serial.

09:55.890 --> 09:57.290
Another victim could die within a month.

09:57.320 --> 09:59.140
What about atlanta?

09:59.160 --> 10:00.680
That's a family annihilator.

10:00.690 --> 10:04.770
Father snaps, takes out the flock, puts any
relative in the area in immediate danger.

10:04.800 --> 10:06.180
I'd take the team there first.

10:06.210 --> 10:11.370
Good. Now, do that with that
whole entire stack, right there.

10:13.950 --> 10:16.170
You ok?

10:16.190 --> 10:18.360
Oh,yeah. I'm fine.

10:18.370 --> 10:20.950
It's just a theory, mr. Jenkins.

10:20.960 --> 10:22.640
You must be out of your damn minds.

10:22.660 --> 10:24.350
We're trying to get some new facts.

10:24.380 --> 10:28.030
Well,you're hell and gone from facts
if you think will Reid killed my son.

10:28.050 --> 10:30.090
So,you were friends?

10:30.100 --> 10:33.030
Who the hell are you to
come here,asking this?

10:33.060 --> 10:35.880
I'm his son.

10:36.960 --> 10:39.750
Spencer?

10:39.770 --> 10:43.720
Spencer, a g-man? How about that?

10:44.370 --> 10:45.890
I don't understand.

10:45.920 --> 10:47.980
Was william around your house often?

10:47.990 --> 10:50.410
The occasional barbecue,
that sort of thing.

10:50.420 --> 10:52.790
Was riley around on these occasions?

10:52.830 --> 10:55.360
Why are you doing this?

10:55.370 --> 10:56.320
I need to know.

10:56.340 --> 11:00.660
Take it from someone who
does know, he was a good man.

11:00.670 --> 11:03.460
Thanks for your time.

11:03.910 --> 11:07.610
Where is he, these days? My dad?

11:07.620 --> 11:12.340
It's been years, but he's probably
still at that same firm in summerlin.

11:13.710 --> 11:15.650
He's been in town this whole time?

11:15.660 --> 11:18.870
Far as i know.

11:22.300 --> 11:23.420
You know summerlin?

11:23.430 --> 11:26.390
Yeah. It's like 9 miles
east of here. Off the 95.

11:26.400 --> 11:29.560
He was 10 minutes away
and never let me know.

11:32.210 --> 11:34.190
Can i help you,gentlemen?

11:34.210 --> 11:37.020
Yeah.

11:39.330 --> 11:41.230
We'd like to speak with william Reid.

11:41.250 --> 11:42.510
Is he expecting you?

11:42.530 --> 11:43.940
I don't think so.

11:43.950 --> 11:44.870
He's in a meeting right now.

11:44.890 --> 11:47.970
Why don't you have a seat
and i'll tell him you're here.

11:52.950 --> 11:54.110
You ok?

11:54.120 --> 11:58.580
Yeah. No--yeah--i'm going
to go to the bathroom.

12:01.450 --> 12:03.130
I've never seen him like this before.

12:03.150 --> 12:06.030
17 years is a long time
to go between visits.

12:06.040 --> 12:07.570
Not long enough. The kid's still angry.

12:07.580 --> 12:09.100
Yeah,i'm starting to get that.

12:09.110 --> 12:13.260
I'll be right back. Here you go.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.710
You from the fbi?

12:15.720 --> 12:20.620
Yes,sir. Mr. Reid, i'm agent
Rossi. This is agent Morgan.

12:20.630 --> 12:23.460
This wouldn't be about the city
council investigation,would it?

12:23.470 --> 12:26.870
No,this is, uh,more
of a personal matter.

12:26.890 --> 12:28.040
It concerns your son.

12:28.060 --> 12:30.010
My son? Did something happen?

12:30.020 --> 12:33.440
That's what we're trying to find out.

12:35.340 --> 12:38.750
Hello,dad.

12:44.040 --> 12:46.150
You don't look like me anymore.

12:46.160 --> 12:48.450
You used to. Everybody said so.

12:48.460 --> 12:51.230
They say some people
look like their dogs,too.

12:51.250 --> 12:53.500
It's attributed to
prolonged mutual exposure.

12:53.510 --> 12:54.520
Elderly couples,also.

12:54.530 --> 12:57.610
They unconsciously mimic the expressions of
people they've been around their whole life.

12:57.640 --> 13:00.560
So,it kind of-- kind of makes sense
that i wouldn't really look like you.

13:00.580 --> 13:03.360
I haven't seen you in 20 years.

13:05.010 --> 13:06.120
So,are you in town on work?

13:06.130 --> 13:07.700
We're just wrapping up a case.

13:07.710 --> 13:09.810
A 5-year-old boy was
abducted and murdered.

13:09.820 --> 13:13.680
I read about that.
Uh,ethan hayes, right?

13:13.690 --> 13:15.290
That's terrible.

13:15.300 --> 13:20.220
That case got me thinking
about riley jenkins.

13:20.230 --> 13:22.110
You remember riley jenkins?

13:22.120 --> 13:23.250
Of course.

13:23.260 --> 13:25.690
I've been having dreams about
him for a really long time.

13:25.700 --> 13:30.400
But when we came back here for this case,
it jogged something and the dream changed.

13:30.420 --> 13:34.180
I saw his killer and he was you.

13:35.420 --> 13:36.790
Interesting dream.

13:36.800 --> 13:38.350
You don't seem all that surprised.

13:38.370 --> 13:41.120
I stopped being surprised by
spencer's mind a long time ago.

13:41.150 --> 13:44.480
There are certain criteria we consider
when looking at this type of suspect.

13:44.510 --> 13:47.500
You fit parts of that profile.

13:47.510 --> 13:48.490
Me?

13:48.500 --> 13:51.420
We just want your cooperation.

13:51.430 --> 13:53.900
My cooperat...

13:55.290 --> 13:58.860
You're not actually saying you
think i killed riley jenkins?

13:58.880 --> 13:59.820
We didn't say that.

13:59.830 --> 14:01.580
Good,'cause that's absurd.

14:01.600 --> 14:04.520
We'd just like permission to look through
your computer, access your records.

14:04.530 --> 14:08.330
And what would you be
looking for exactly?

14:09.420 --> 14:12.310
You want access to my files?

14:12.330 --> 14:15.040
Get a warrant.

14:15.570 --> 14:18.280
We can't get a warrant, so we have to
go under the radar on this one,garcia.

14:18.300 --> 14:19.790
You want me to hack
your father's network?

14:19.820 --> 14:20.690
You sure about this?

14:20.700 --> 14:23.810
I really wish people
would stop asking me that.

14:30.040 --> 14:32.530
<i>You're.........</i>

14:41.120 --> 14:43.800
Hey,you're pretty good.

14:45.520 --> 14:47.760
Was the envelope dropped
off at the front desk first?

14:47.780 --> 14:49.430
Nope,it went straight to my room.

14:49.440 --> 14:51.010
So,they knew what room you were in.

14:51.020 --> 14:53.350
I do have to admit, the timing
of this is a little suspicious.

14:53.370 --> 14:56.370
Yeah. An hour after i see my
father, we're handed another suspect.

14:56.380 --> 14:57.720
You think you knew this guy?

14:57.740 --> 14:59.910
I don't know. I think
so,but i'm not sure.

14:59.920 --> 15:00.980
I--i--no, i
don't know.

15:00.990 --> 15:02.900
Exposed himself to a minor.

15:02.910 --> 15:04.870
That's a precursor to molestation.

15:04.880 --> 15:06.100
And murder.

15:06.110 --> 15:08.710
We should take a
closer look at this guy.

15:09.810 --> 15:10.890
it's garcia.

15:10.900 --> 15:12.110
Yeah,talk to me, baby girl.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.590
I'm not interrupting boy
time at crazy horse 2,am i?

15:14.600 --> 15:15.590
You know that's not my thing.

15:15.600 --> 15:16.970
I'm more for in-room entertainment.

15:16.980 --> 15:19.740
I can't help you but
i do give good phone.

15:19.760 --> 15:21.010
Let me hear what you got.

15:21.040 --> 15:23.290
Reid,we've been all up
in your father's business.

15:23.300 --> 15:24.050
What did you find?

15:24.060 --> 15:26.130
Well,let me tell you
first what i did not find.

15:26.140 --> 15:30.910
No kiddie porn, no membership to illicit
websites, no dubious emails, no chat room history.

15:30.920 --> 15:32.190
What about his finances?

15:32.200 --> 15:33.360
We went back 10 years.

15:33.370 --> 15:35.730
No questionable transactions
that we can find.

15:35.740 --> 15:38.500
Well,he did buy a ticket to
see celine dion 6 months ago.

15:38.510 --> 15:39.810
But i think we can overlook that.

15:39.820 --> 15:42.290
He's smart. Is it possible he
kept things under the table?

15:42.300 --> 15:46.490
Well,of course. But from what we can
tell,Reid, he doesn't fit the profile.

15:46.500 --> 15:50.360
We can tell you other things
about him, if you want to know.

15:50.370 --> 15:51.570
I'm listening.

15:51.580 --> 15:54.260
He's a workaholic, he actually
logs more hours than we do.

15:54.270 --> 15:56.430
He makes decent money,but
he doesn't spend a lot of it.

15:56.440 --> 15:58.830
He has a modest house.
He drives a hybrid.

15:58.840 --> 16:01.340
He doesn't travel much. He
stays away from the casinos.

16:01.350 --> 16:05.870
Um,and according to his veterinary
bills, he has a very sick cat.

16:05.880 --> 16:09.590
He appears to spend most of his free time
alone, he goes to the movies a lot,and he reads.

16:09.600 --> 16:13.910
And from his collection of first
editions, it seems his favorite author is--

16:13.920 --> 16:15.730
Isaac asimov, i remember that one.

16:15.740 --> 16:17.830
He does have one other major interest.

16:17.840 --> 16:23.200
On his home computer, he's archived, like,a
ka-jillion things on one common subject.

16:23.210 --> 16:24.300
What?

16:24.310 --> 16:25.810
You,kiddo.

16:25.820 --> 16:28.350
He's got,like, everything
that's been published online.

16:28.360 --> 16:32.060
Every article you've been quoted in, pieces
you've written for behavioral science journals,

16:32.070 --> 16:34.060
He even has a copy of your dissertation.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.260
He's keeping tabs on you.

16:35.270 --> 16:36.370
That's saying something.

16:36.380 --> 16:37.580
Yeah,he googled me.

16:37.590 --> 16:41.030
That makes up for everything.
I'm going to get some air.

16:43.460 --> 16:44.580
You guys still there?

16:44.590 --> 16:46.170
I thought we were giving him good news.

16:46.180 --> 16:47.310
What else can we do?

16:47.320 --> 16:49.380
Yeah,look up a name
for us, if you would.

16:49.390 --> 16:50.780
Gary Brendan Michaels.

16:50.790 --> 16:52.590
You like this gary guy
for the riley murder?

16:52.620 --> 16:54.990
Somebody does.

17:07.839 --> 17:09.740
wow,looks like you got a loose one.

17:09.750 --> 17:10.500
No such thing.

17:10.510 --> 17:13.190
These machines run on
random number generators.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.310
No brains,no bias.

17:15.319 --> 17:16.690
Best odds in the house,though.

17:16.710 --> 17:19.170
Really? I thought that
craps had the best odds.

17:19.180 --> 17:22.390
Normally,video poker odds are slightly
worse at . 7 percent in your favor.

17:22.400 --> 17:25.630
But if you employ optimal strategy
and always drop with a royal flush,

17:25.650 --> 17:28.710
You can push those odds to 2 percent.

17:28.720 --> 17:31.530
Smart and handsome.

17:31.540 --> 17:33.370
So,are you in town for the convention?

17:33.390 --> 17:37.370
Um,there are 12 conventions in town this
week. Which one are you talking about?

17:37.380 --> 17:40.280
Take your pick.

17:43.090 --> 17:45.960
6 minutes.

17:45.970 --> 17:47.300
Excuse me?

17:47.310 --> 17:51.210
Um,it was something i used to say to my
mom to try to get her to quit smoking.

17:51.230 --> 17:53.130
A cigarette takes 6
minutes off your life.

17:53.140 --> 17:58.320
So every time she'd light one,i'd say, "it's
6 minutes less that i get to spend with you."

17:58.340 --> 17:59.980
- Did it work?
- No.

17:59.990 --> 18:03.210
Because i've tried it all--the
gum, the patch. Nothing works.

18:03.220 --> 18:07.650
You should try hypnosis. They've had--
there's been a lot of success in...

18:08.170 --> 18:12.140
Tell you what, i'll put mine
out if you buy me a drink.

18:12.150 --> 18:13.760
Uh,not today, sweetheart.

18:13.770 --> 18:16.730
We've been looking all over
the place for you. Come on.

18:18.020 --> 18:20.910
Hey,you won,like, $2,000 here.

18:20.920 --> 18:22.570
Keep it.

18:22.580 --> 18:25.800
You do realize you just
gave two grand to a hooker?

18:25.830 --> 18:27.520
Must have been quite a conversation.

18:27.530 --> 18:28.940
What was it about?

18:28.960 --> 18:31.510
How to stop smoking.

18:32.790 --> 18:36.330
Thank you for seeing
us on such short notice.

18:36.340 --> 18:39.780
Well,i'm always happy to assist the fbi.

18:39.800 --> 18:42.000
Is there a witness
you want me to look at?

18:42.010 --> 18:44.190
Uh,yeah. Me.

18:44.200 --> 18:47.160
I'm trying to recover
memories from my childhood.

18:47.170 --> 18:49.040
There was a murder.

18:49.050 --> 18:50.870
How long ago are we talking about?

18:50.880 --> 18:52.850
I was 4.

18:52.860 --> 18:56.530
Memories from that age can
be difficult to interpret.

18:56.540 --> 18:58.910
I'm aware of the
limitations of hypnotherapy.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.700
Well,then you're aware
of suggestion issues.

19:01.710 --> 19:04.680
If you've looked into this
case, you may have a bias.

19:04.690 --> 19:07.910
Are you saying what he remembers
under hypnosis may not be real?

19:07.920 --> 19:09.250
It's a possibility.

19:09.260 --> 19:11.270
Either way,it's a tough sell in court.

19:11.280 --> 19:13.310
We won't be using this
for evidentiary purposes.

19:13.320 --> 19:17.360
It's really just for me.

19:17.370 --> 19:20.050
The suppressed memories
are about my father.

19:20.060 --> 19:21.630
I'd like to monitor this session.

19:21.640 --> 19:24.040
Make sure you get him
to the right place.

19:24.050 --> 19:26.500
You want to sit in?

19:26.520 --> 19:29.140
I don't normally allow that.

19:29.150 --> 19:33.960
In case you haven't realized,nothing
about this is normal.

19:33.970 --> 19:37.960
I want you to hold my
wrist in your left hand.

19:37.970 --> 19:42.930
And if you should feel any fear, i
want you to squeeze, do you understand?

19:43.500 --> 19:46.120
Yes.

19:46.130 --> 19:49.300
Go back to the night you
were just telling me about.

19:49.310 --> 19:52.710
You're at home, in your room.

19:55.110 --> 19:57.420
You can't sleep because
your parents are arguing.

19:57.430 --> 20:01.020
i don't know what to do. I had to do
something,but i didn't know what to do.

20:01.030 --> 20:03.900
i'm not going to discuss it anymore.

20:04.460 --> 20:07.180
- He's coming in.
- Who?

20:13.370 --> 20:15.680
I know you're awake, spencer.

20:15.690 --> 20:16.600
It's dad.

20:16.610 --> 20:18.790
What about him, spencer?

20:18.800 --> 20:21.390
What is he doing?

20:21.400 --> 20:24.310
Daddy loves you, you know that?

20:28.270 --> 20:29.520
I don't want to be here.

20:29.530 --> 20:32.590
Ok. It's ok,spencer.

20:32.600 --> 20:35.510
Take us to where the light is.

20:35.520 --> 20:37.680
To the next morning.

20:37.690 --> 20:39.800
The sun is coming up.

20:39.810 --> 20:42.510
Where are you,spencer?

20:49.590 --> 20:53.650
Mom? My mom. She's at the window.

20:53.660 --> 20:57.220
She's thinking.

20:58.170 --> 21:01.560
She's been crying.

21:06.620 --> 21:08.760
She saw him.

21:08.770 --> 21:12.650
Who? Your father?

21:17.500 --> 21:20.230
Do you talk to her?

21:20.240 --> 21:26.340
No. No,i wanna--
I wanna see...

21:33.940 --> 21:36.500
What is it,spencer?

21:36.510 --> 21:37.680
What are you seeing?

21:37.690 --> 21:38.400
That's enough.

21:38.410 --> 21:41.140
I need you to leave this
location now,spencer.

21:41.160 --> 21:43.810
Damn it. Wake him up.

21:50.160 --> 21:52.010
I'm going to count backward from 5.

21:52.020 --> 21:57.410
5,4,3,2,1, and wake.

21:57.820 --> 22:03.810
Reid. It's ok. It's ok. It's
ok. It's ok,Reid. It's ok.

22:04.030 --> 22:08.360
What happened? What did you see?

22:14.010 --> 22:15.580
Try to rember, mom.

22:15.590 --> 22:17.190
No,i can't.

22:17.200 --> 22:18.580
You were there.

22:18.590 --> 22:21.480
You watched dad burn the bloody clothes.

22:21.500 --> 22:22.740
You had a dream.

22:22.750 --> 22:24.780
Mom,this was not a
dream. This was a memory.

22:24.790 --> 22:27.000
It was a memory and i saw you.

22:27.010 --> 22:31.110
Your mind, ah,such a treasure.

22:31.130 --> 22:34.140
Even as a baby you knew about
things you weren't supposed to know.

22:34.150 --> 22:37.000
This is not about me. This
is about riley jenkins.

22:37.010 --> 22:39.390
It was always about you.

22:39.400 --> 22:43.060
Please,mom. Please.
Please,just try to rember.

22:43.070 --> 22:47.310
Remember riley.

22:48.390 --> 22:50.990
Riley?

22:51.240 --> 22:53.770
Riley was real.

22:53.780 --> 22:55.460
Oh,poor riley.

22:55.470 --> 22:59.040
Yes,poor riley. Poor riley.
Did dad do something to him?

22:59.050 --> 23:01.180
- Dad? No.
- Think. Think.

23:01.190 --> 23:02.990
- Think. - No,no.
That's--no,no.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.700
Now you're confusing me,spencer.

23:04.720 --> 23:07.670
You knew. You knew about
dad,and you didn't do anything.

23:07.680 --> 23:11.950
No! You don't know. No! No!
You don't know! You don't-- no!

23:11.960 --> 23:14.180
No! No! No,no,no,no, no,no,no,no!

23:14.190 --> 23:18.890
No,no,no,no!

23:18.900 --> 23:22.770
I'm just going to give
you something to relax.

23:24.910 --> 23:26.680
No.

23:35.370 --> 23:38.110
It could have been you.

23:38.120 --> 23:41.410
What? What did you say?

23:43.110 --> 23:46.060
It could have been you.

23:46.490 --> 23:48.060
She's not stable,Reid.

23:48.070 --> 23:50.180
You can't put stock in what she
says. I don't need to tell you that.

23:50.190 --> 23:52.020
And i don't need to tell
you this is textbook.

23:52.040 --> 23:54.730
Father reroutes compulsion to molest
away from his own son to a surrogate.

23:54.740 --> 23:58.020
The woman thought riley jenkins was an
imaginary friend until you told her otherwise.

23:58.030 --> 23:59.880
The mind's way of suppressing
memories she doesn't want to face.

23:59.890 --> 24:01.430
You're losing objectivity here,kid.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.220
I'm not trying to say
i know what happened.

24:03.230 --> 24:05.470
Or how my dad's involved,Morgan.

24:05.480 --> 24:08.030
But my dad's involved.

24:18.990 --> 24:21.870
What's he doing here?

24:27.140 --> 24:28.820
You got no evidence.

24:28.830 --> 24:32.740
A suspect can be detained for questioning
for 48 hours, regardless of evidence.

24:32.750 --> 24:36.060
I'm not in the habit of ruining
people's reputations on a whim.

24:36.070 --> 24:37.480
Where's your captain? I
want to talk to your captain.

24:37.490 --> 24:38.960
Talk all you want.

24:38.970 --> 24:43.390
This is a local murder, and your
authority ends at the state line.

24:44.770 --> 24:47.240
Look...

24:47.670 --> 24:51.460
Why don't you just head back
over to the fountain view

24:51.470 --> 24:54.060
And have a couple of drinks by
the pool and think about this.

24:54.070 --> 24:55.410
I have thought about this.

24:55.420 --> 24:56.450
The guy's your father.

24:56.460 --> 24:58.710
What's your point, detective?

24:58.720 --> 25:01.120
Maybe you're here to work
out some other issues?

25:01.130 --> 25:03.840
Ok,listen,detective.

25:03.850 --> 25:09.470
If you helped us out with this.

25:09.480 --> 25:12.530
We just want him on his heels.

25:13.720 --> 25:15.130
You've got 24 hours.

25:15.140 --> 25:17.630
I appreciate that.

25:21.400 --> 25:23.230
Reid.

25:23.240 --> 25:24.920
You gotta keep your head,man.

25:24.940 --> 25:26.840
He just agreed to it.
It happens all the time.

25:26.850 --> 25:28.270
You know how these guys are.

25:28.280 --> 25:31.530
They just want to feel like
they're the ones in control.

25:34.330 --> 25:35.590
Talk to me,garcia.

25:35.600 --> 25:40.900
So,this gary michaels you asked me to track down
seems to have peeled himself right off the grid.

25:40.910 --> 25:41.950
What did he do? Skip town?

25:41.960 --> 25:43.780
Feels it. Maybe he took a new name,too.

25:43.790 --> 25:48.150
Everything in his name laps from non-use
in the year after the riley jenkins murder.

25:48.170 --> 25:50.240
Maybe he didn't want to stick
around for the investigation.

25:50.270 --> 25:56.800
In addition to the indecent exposure wrap,
he also had some lewd behavior,trespassing.

25:56.810 --> 25:57.590
Trespassing?

25:57.600 --> 25:58.600
At a nursery school.

25:58.610 --> 26:01.090
Hard to believe the cops never
pegged this guy as a suspect.

26:01.100 --> 26:02.550
Any other avenues to find him?

26:02.560 --> 26:05.510
You betcha. They swabbed him
in '85 for the exposure beef,

26:05.520 --> 26:07.480
So i'm sending up balloons
through vicap and codis.

26:07.490 --> 26:10.320
If he's offended again over the past
20 years under a different name...

26:10.330 --> 26:12.570
Which,considering his
type, he probably has...

26:12.580 --> 26:13.760
He will pop up somewhere.

26:13.770 --> 26:16.160
All right. Keep me in the loop.

26:16.170 --> 26:17.960
Later.

26:22.240 --> 26:24.270
What's with the wincing? You ok?

26:24.280 --> 26:25.090
Fine.

26:25.100 --> 26:27.350
Are you sure? I noticed this earlier.

26:27.360 --> 26:29.780
Earlier? How often?

26:29.790 --> 26:34.620
Um,in the last hour.
I'd say every 10 minutes.

26:34.630 --> 26:35.740
J.J. Why didn't you tell anyone?

26:35.750 --> 26:38.130
Because i am not due
for another 3 weeks.

26:38.150 --> 26:39.950
Newsflash! You're in labor.

26:39.960 --> 26:43.190
No,no,no. Because Reid
needs us right now.

26:43.200 --> 26:47.350
You need you, right now. Come on,get up.

26:47.360 --> 26:48.780
Ladies and gentlemen, i'm not a doctor.

26:48.790 --> 26:51.880
I don't even play one on tv,but i
believe young J.J.'s going into labor.

26:51.900 --> 26:52.760
Are you ok?

26:52.770 --> 26:54.860
I'll get the car.

26:54.870 --> 26:56.740
- I need to call will.
- From the car,honey.

26:56.750 --> 26:59.050
Breathe and walk. Breathe and walk.

26:59.060 --> 27:03.030
Agent Todd, i hope you're ready
because your job starts right now.

27:14.890 --> 27:16.490
You still think ********

27:16.510 --> 27:17.680
why shouldn't i?

27:17.690 --> 27:20.320
Well,for one thing, gary
michaels fits the profile.

27:20.330 --> 27:22.770
For another, he fled
town after riley's murder.

27:22.780 --> 27:24.630
He's a better suspect
than your dad,Reid.

27:24.640 --> 27:26.980
He's a convenient one.

27:26.990 --> 27:29.540
Someone slipped the file under my
door,Morgan. What am i supposed to think?

27:29.550 --> 27:32.250
Maybe they're trying to help.

27:32.280 --> 27:34.610
Maybe they're trying to protect him.

27:34.620 --> 27:38.460
You're talking about someone helping
to cover up the murder of a child.

27:38.470 --> 27:40.820
Who would do that?

27:41.380 --> 27:45.370
Do you rember how resistant detective hyde
was when i asked him to bring in my father?

27:45.380 --> 27:47.330
So,what? You're accusing a cop now?

27:47.340 --> 27:48.420
It was a police file.

27:48.430 --> 27:51.410
It was a very old police file.
Anybody could have accessed it.

27:51.420 --> 27:55.860
He told me to go back to the fountain view,
have a drink by the pool,and think about things.

27:55.870 --> 27:58.580
You can't possibly
still be mad about that.

27:58.600 --> 28:00.200
I'm not mad. I'm confused.

28:00.210 --> 28:03.580
I never told him we were
staying at the fountain view.

28:22.780 --> 28:25.830
CODIS REPORT MATCH CONFIMED

28:25.840 --> 28:27.750
It's a simple question.

28:27.760 --> 28:30.240
How did the blood get on the clothes?

28:30.250 --> 28:33.670
I told you,i'm not going
to talk without council.

28:33.690 --> 28:35.760
If you don't have anything to
hide,you don't need a lawyer.

28:35.770 --> 28:38.990
Spencer,please. I'm not stupid.

28:40.430 --> 28:42.600
I'm proud of you, you know that?

28:42.610 --> 28:43.900
I'm not stupid either.

28:43.910 --> 28:48.090
No. You've done a lot of good.

28:48.100 --> 28:51.630
I mean,other people with your talents, they
might have sought different opportunities.

28:51.640 --> 28:53.130
The private sector.

28:53.140 --> 28:56.170
My god,you could have made a fortune.

28:56.180 --> 28:57.750
But you chose to help people.

28:57.760 --> 29:00.210
I chose to study murders.

29:00.220 --> 29:01.690
Why do you think that is?

29:01.700 --> 29:04.610
I didn't do this,spencer.

29:04.620 --> 29:05.790
Why can't you believe me?

29:05.800 --> 29:08.340
Like you said, i do
have special talents.

29:08.350 --> 29:11.410
One of them is being able to tell
when somebody is hiding something.

29:11.420 --> 29:13.750
You're angry that i left.

29:13.760 --> 29:14.650
And you're right to be.

29:14.660 --> 29:16.940
You want to make it up to me?

29:16.950 --> 29:19.480
Tell me the truth.

29:24.080 --> 29:27.450
I didn't kill that boy.

29:27.460 --> 29:29.970
But i know who did.

29:29.990 --> 29:31.010
Gary michaels?

29:31.020 --> 29:32.400
How'd you know that?

29:32.410 --> 29:34.520
That was the whole idea,wasn't it?

29:34.530 --> 29:36.560
So,where is gary michaels now,dad?

29:36.570 --> 29:39.580
Spencer,please. Forget it.

29:40.040 --> 29:43.400
You don't want to go down this road.

29:45.430 --> 29:46.720
Everything's fine. We're
checking her in now.

29:46.730 --> 29:49.030
And i got a thing back from
california on your codis query.

29:49.040 --> 29:50.040
Did they find gary michaels?

29:50.050 --> 29:52.110
Some of him.

29:52.120 --> 29:53.260
He's dead?

29:53.270 --> 29:56.550
They dug him up 7 years ago when some new
construction broke ground in the desert.

29:56.560 --> 29:59.560
Whoever killed him was smart enough
to bury him across state lines.

29:59.570 --> 30:01.270
Vegas P. D.never made the connect.

30:01.280 --> 30:02.420
How was he killed?

30:02.430 --> 30:04.960
Judging from the fractures, they
think he was beaten with something.

30:04.970 --> 30:07.130
- A pipe,maybe.
- Or a bat.

30:07.140 --> 30:09.280
Bat?

30:15.770 --> 30:20.110
Maybe it wasn't riley's blood on
those clothes your dad was burning.

30:27.930 --> 30:30.570
<i>{\a6}Sheriff's......</i>

30:28.640 --> 30:31.940
Been rumors a body was buried
up at the barker ranch for years.

30:31.960 --> 30:34.620
On account of that's where
chuck manson had his hideout.

30:34.630 --> 30:37.110
When we dug this one up, we
went ahead and had him typed.

30:37.120 --> 30:38.850
Thought maybe it could be related.

30:38.870 --> 30:40.230
It's a good thing you did.

30:40.240 --> 30:41.710
Might never have I. D.'d him otherwise.

30:41.720 --> 30:44.140
So,why all the fuss over a dead pervert?

30:44.150 --> 30:46.880
We think he may have killed a
boy in vegas over 20 years ago.

30:46.890 --> 30:49.010
Is that how he ended up
in the ground? Revenge?

30:49.020 --> 30:49.980
Possibly.

30:49.990 --> 30:54.450
It says here you have a fingerprint in evidence,
lifted from the victim's broken glasses.

30:54.460 --> 30:57.000
We ran it up the flagpole
a couple of times.

30:57.010 --> 30:58.120
Nothing ever came up.

30:58.130 --> 31:00.580
That was then. Now we have
someone to compare it to.

31:00.590 --> 31:01.570
A suspect?

31:01.580 --> 31:03.680
Well,we're going to want
to run it through afis,too.

31:03.690 --> 31:08.990
That's a lot of taxpayer dollars being
spent to solve a public service murder.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.460
If you ask me, the guy
got just what he deserved.

31:12.470 --> 31:14.300
He's right,you know.

31:14.310 --> 31:15.480
We don't have to run this print.

31:15.500 --> 31:18.350
Of course we do. Whatever michaels
did, he deserved a fair trial.

31:18.360 --> 31:20.940
Reid,you wanted to know if
your father killed riley.

31:20.950 --> 31:24.100
All signs point to "no."
you got what you need.

31:24.110 --> 31:25.750
What i need is the truth.

31:25.760 --> 31:30.330
If this print belongs to your dad,
he could go away for a long time.

31:30.340 --> 31:33.230
You're just determined
to nail him,aren't you?

31:33.240 --> 31:34.640
Doesn't even matter what for.

31:34.650 --> 31:37.450
If you don't want to run it,i will.

31:47.900 --> 31:49.960
I'm told you're refusing medication.

31:49.970 --> 31:53.570
I'm just holding off for a
little while, if you don't mind.

31:53.580 --> 31:55.580
You know what will happen.

31:55.590 --> 31:59.030
Tremors,panic, then the voices.

31:59.040 --> 32:03.910
But before that, when the fog
lifts, a window of clarity.

32:03.920 --> 32:06.940
I really need that right now.

32:06.950 --> 32:09.520
I can give you some latitude here.

32:09.530 --> 32:12.990
Just tell me why.

32:13.400 --> 32:16.930
I want to remember.

32:36.770 --> 32:39.730
Yeah,agent Morgan.

32:40.430 --> 32:42.800
You did?

32:42.810 --> 32:45.660
You're 100 percent certain?

32:46.320 --> 32:49.310
Ok. Thank you.

32:52.400 --> 32:54.770
We're going to have to
get an arrest warrant.

32:54.780 --> 32:56.070
It was a match?

32:56.080 --> 32:59.750
Yeah. But it wasn't your dad.

33:20.470 --> 33:22.690
- We got company.
- What's he doing here?

33:23.250 --> 33:25.690
We notified your captain
about this,detective.

33:25.700 --> 33:27.020
It's all legit.

33:27.030 --> 33:28.140
I'm not trying to stop you.

33:28.160 --> 33:31.060
I just want to be the
one to bring him in.

33:31.070 --> 33:33.990
It'll go easier.

33:37.270 --> 33:38.210
He's my friend.

33:38.220 --> 33:40.200
Yeah,we figured that
much. You,lou,my father.

33:40.210 --> 33:42.230
You slipped us the
michaels file,didn't you?

33:42.240 --> 33:43.430
You were after the wrong guy.

33:43.440 --> 33:45.510
But you knew who the
right guy was all along?

33:45.520 --> 33:48.070
And what lou did to him.

33:48.080 --> 33:49.230
There wasn't any evidence.

33:49.240 --> 33:52.070
Did you even look?

33:52.080 --> 33:53.780
You want to link him up,go ahead.

33:53.790 --> 33:55.400
But he rides in with us.

33:55.410 --> 33:58.160
Appreciate that.

34:10.670 --> 34:13.150
Who else was with you?

34:13.159 --> 34:14.150
No one.

34:14.159 --> 34:17.239
You're saying you killed gary
michaels by yourself,all alone.

34:17.250 --> 34:17.980
That's right.

34:17.989 --> 34:20.600
And william Reid wasn't a party to this?

34:20.610 --> 34:21.190
No.

34:21.199 --> 34:22.340
You're lying.

34:22.350 --> 34:23.520
I'm not lying.

34:23.530 --> 34:26.040
He was burning bloody
clothes. I saw him.

34:26.050 --> 34:27.949
What makes you think gary
michaels killed your boy?

34:27.960 --> 34:29.000
He admitted it.

34:29.010 --> 34:31.920
You beat a guy with a baseball bat,
he's going to admit to a lot of things.

34:31.940 --> 34:34.139
How do you know he was the right guy?

34:34.150 --> 34:36.300
I know.

34:36.310 --> 34:39.560
He approached another
kid in the neighborhood.

34:39.570 --> 34:40.929
Hey,you're pretty good.

34:40.940 --> 34:43.469
And how do you know that?

34:43.480 --> 34:47.820
- I was told by a concerned party.
- Who? Another parent?

34:47.830 --> 34:50.370
Mind if i play?

34:52.190 --> 34:54.060
That's all i'm going
to say on the subject.

34:54.070 --> 34:55.030
Who was it?

34:55.040 --> 34:56.980
I told you that's all i'm
going to say on the sub--

34:56.989 --> 34:58.940
- Who was it?
- Agent Reid?

34:58.950 --> 35:00.720
Do not interfere with this
interrogation,detective.

35:00.730 --> 35:04.050
This is not your case anymore.

35:04.340 --> 35:07.640
Spencer,it was me.

35:10.920 --> 35:15.280
I'd seen him around at your
ball games, at the park.

35:15.290 --> 35:18.470
You used to play chess
there,do you remember?

35:18.480 --> 35:20.280
You played with him once.

35:20.290 --> 35:21.480
With gary michaels?

35:21.490 --> 35:23.010
I didn't know that
was his name back then,

35:23.020 --> 35:26.420
But it wasn't unusual for
you to play with adults.

35:26.430 --> 35:29.380
And you'd win,too.

35:29.830 --> 35:31.020
Did he do something to me?

35:31.030 --> 35:34.190
Oh,no. God,no. It
never got to that point.

35:34.200 --> 35:38.670
But when i saw the way he looked
at you, i knew what he was.

35:38.680 --> 35:40.610
I could just tell.

35:40.620 --> 35:42.500
A mother knows.

35:43.150 --> 35:44.970
Yes.

35:45.690 --> 35:49.620
So,you told riley's dad.

35:49.630 --> 35:52.480
2 nights later, lou called the house.

35:52.490 --> 35:54.490
He was agitated.

35:54.510 --> 35:57.260
He said he needed me to meet him.

35:58.770 --> 35:59.900
Is that him?

35:59.910 --> 36:01.780
Yes.

36:03.100 --> 36:05.530
His name is gary michaels.

36:05.540 --> 36:07.670
He has a history.

36:07.680 --> 36:09.910
History?

36:10.590 --> 36:12.630
He's done things to kids.

36:12.640 --> 36:14.860
How do you know?

36:17.520 --> 36:20.720
You should go now.

36:20.730 --> 36:22.130
What are you going to do?

36:22.140 --> 36:24.660
Go home,diana.

36:33.980 --> 36:38.050
I sat there. I couldn't
move. It was like a dream.

36:38.820 --> 36:42.050
That paralysis in the
face of something terrible.

36:42.070 --> 36:44.950
What happened after that?

36:45.350 --> 36:48.610
It's ok,diana.

36:49.210 --> 36:51.810
Go on.

36:51.820 --> 36:55.630
At some point,i found myself
walking towards the house.

37:07.670 --> 37:12.010
Oh,my god. Lou,what did you do?

37:21.040 --> 37:24.030
And the rest...

37:24.040 --> 37:26.150
It's all dark after that.

37:26.160 --> 37:28.330
You came home.

37:28.340 --> 37:29.520
She couldn't talk at first.

37:29.530 --> 37:32.200
But eventually i came to
understand what had happened.

37:32.210 --> 37:36.160
And i knew that nobody could ever know.

37:37.900 --> 37:39.750
So,you never told anyone?

37:39.760 --> 37:42.610
No,she could have been implicated.

37:42.620 --> 37:45.450
And i had to protect her.

37:50.310 --> 37:53.550
You were burning her bloody clothes.

37:55.440 --> 38:00.280
But the knowing, you
can't burn that away.

38:00.610 --> 38:04.120
It changes everything.

38:04.130 --> 38:05.420
Is that why you left?

38:05.430 --> 38:06.870
I tried to keep us together, spencer.

38:06.880 --> 38:12.780
I swear to you, but the weight
of that knowledge,it was too much.

38:19.170 --> 38:22.280
You could have come back.

38:22.290 --> 38:23.840
Could have started over.

38:23.850 --> 38:26.880
I didn't know how to
take care of you anymore.

38:26.890 --> 38:30.420
When i lost that confidence,
there was no going back.

38:31.130 --> 38:34.360
What's done is done.

38:37.890 --> 38:41.820
At least now you know the truth.

38:42.190 --> 38:45.000
I was wrong about everything. I'm sorry.

38:54.060 --> 38:57.070
I am,too,spencer.

39:01.710 --> 39:04.910
"there is no refuge from memory
and remorse in this world.

39:04.920 --> 39:09.690
"the spirits of our foolish deeds
haunt us with or without repentance."

39:09.720 --> 39:12.150
Gilbert parker.

39:12.160 --> 39:14.400
Well,he looks just like you.

39:14.410 --> 39:16.000
Let's hope he grows out of that.

39:16.010 --> 39:18.870
Just as long as he
doesn't inherit the accent.

39:19.310 --> 39:21.430
Is there room for one more in here?

39:21.440 --> 39:22.720
Spence,hi.

39:22.730 --> 39:25.330
Welcome back.

39:27.370 --> 39:28.610
Congratulations.

39:28.620 --> 39:30.770
Thank you.

39:30.790 --> 39:35.670
How is it that i just went through 15
hours of labor and you look worse than i do?

39:35.680 --> 39:39.000
Don't be ridiculous. You look beautiful.

39:41.970 --> 39:45.590
- Well,i could sure use some coffee. Anyone else?
- Sure.

39:45.600 --> 39:48.110
My treat.

39:51.750 --> 39:53.230
You ok?

39:53.240 --> 39:54.780
Yeah,yeah. You?

39:54.790 --> 39:59.530
Yeah,yeah,you sure? 'Cause there's something
i wanted to ask you, but it can wait.

39:59.540 --> 40:01.770
What is it?

40:01.780 --> 40:05.680
Will and i were talking,and,um...

40:06.160 --> 40:10.060
We want you to be henry's godfather.

40:10.980 --> 40:13.830
- I don't even know-- i don't know--
- here,do you want to hold him?

40:14.340 --> 40:17.470
- It's ok. Here you go.
- Ok.

40:17.480 --> 40:19.520
Watch his head. There you go.

40:19.530 --> 40:21.740
Hello,henry.

40:21.750 --> 40:26.900
If anything should happen to us, it's up to you
and garcia to make sure this boy gets into yale.

40:26.910 --> 40:31.340
Yale. Yale? Do you want
to go to yale,henry?

40:31.350 --> 40:34.940
That was your godfather's safety school.

40:34.950 --> 40:39.290
Don't worry,i can get you into
cal-tech with one phone call.
