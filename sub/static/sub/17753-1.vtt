00:29.340 --> 00:31.220
When the uplink came through
with the work orders,

00:31.470 --> 00:35.270
he had a strange feeling everything
was about to change for him.

00:35.310 --> 00:36.390
Maybe it just had
something to do

00:36.430 --> 00:38.350
With the way the world is today...

00:38.350 --> 00:40.270
Bio-enhanced gangsters,

00:40.270 --> 00:43.150
information terrorists,
cyborg outlaws.

00:43.150 --> 00:45.990
Everything so congested
with high-tech overload,

00:46.030 --> 00:48.870
that he was starting to feel
a little numb.

00:54.670 --> 00:58.310
You see, there's an old saying
in his business,

00:58.350 --> 01:01.230
"it pays to be more than human."

01:03.310 --> 01:05.190
I don't think he was
so sure anymore.

01:17.470 --> 01:20.350
Move and I'll crush your throat.

01:39.590 --> 01:41.630
I had to be sure you weren't armed.

01:41.670 --> 01:44.390
Can't be too careful nowadays.

01:44.390 --> 01:46.430
There's undercover police everywhere.

01:53.910 --> 01:55.790
Relax, baby.

02:06.470 --> 02:09.310
Goddamn cop!

02:09.470 --> 02:11.430
Goddamn terrorist.

02:26.710 --> 02:29.430
The things people do
to get ahead.

02:29.430 --> 02:31.350
His work order turned out to be

02:31.390 --> 02:33.270
a nicely shaped chip smuggler,

02:33.470 --> 02:35.230
who had some expensive
bio-engineering done

02:35.390 --> 02:37.150
to her insides.

02:37.150 --> 02:38.230
She was able to charge double,

02:38.270 --> 02:41.110
because of the extra rams
she could carry.

02:50.710 --> 02:53.430
"Morico" was the alias
she had been using,

02:53.470 --> 02:55.350
and she had hoped to
download her data

02:55.390 --> 02:58.390
on a gang of terrorists, known
as "The Red Army Hammerheads."

03:00.190 --> 03:02.150
The Hammerheads...
They're a cute bunch,

03:02.190 --> 03:04.070
fighting a lost cause.

03:04.110 --> 03:05.990
Someday i expect to see
their scan I.D. S

03:06.030 --> 03:07.750
Come over the uplink.

03:07.790 --> 03:10.630
But right now, Morico
had been his work order.

03:10.830 --> 03:12.710
Then it was filled.

03:19.550 --> 03:22.390
See? Laundering data
can be dangerous.

03:24.270 --> 03:27.150
You break the law...
Go to hell.

03:59.750 --> 04:02.470
That guy we passed in
the hall, he's a cop.

04:02.510 --> 04:03.590
Shit!

04:26.510 --> 04:28.430
No problem.

05:00.910 --> 05:03.110
Our courier's been iced
by an L.A.P.D. agent.

05:03.790 --> 05:05.830
He beat us to the data chip.
We're in pursuit.

05:05.870 --> 05:07.790
Are you sure he's L.A.P.D.?

05:07.790 --> 05:09.550
He's a cop, all right.

06:01.590 --> 06:03.310
Get him!

06:06.190 --> 06:07.270
Aarghh!

06:09.230 --> 06:11.150
Go on.
Go, go, go!

06:16.910 --> 06:18.670
Aaah!

06:30.350 --> 06:32.270
Argh!

09:09.550 --> 09:11.270
Ugh!

09:16.190 --> 09:18.030
That knee was brand new.

09:27.590 --> 09:29.470
Fuck, he's quick.

10:00.230 --> 10:02.230
Aw, sensitive man.

10:03.990 --> 10:05.110
Give it a rest.

11:02.750 --> 11:04.630
You son of a bitch!

11:04.670 --> 11:07.310
You toss your weapon aside,

11:07.350 --> 11:09.230
and you step away,

11:09.270 --> 11:11.150
and I'll say you were cooperative.

11:13.270 --> 11:15.910
I don't think this is funny.

11:16.110 --> 11:17.830
Cops are animals.

11:18.030 --> 11:19.910
You don't know who that
woman was back in the room.

11:19.950 --> 11:21.830
You don't know who I am.

11:23.790 --> 11:26.630
- You're a terrorist.
- You're confused.

11:26.630 --> 11:29.390
We're trying to save humankind,

11:29.430 --> 11:31.270
And you...
You protect the machines.

11:33.390 --> 11:35.350
No wonder you protect them.

11:35.350 --> 11:39.030
You're mostly machine. You're not
really human anymore, are you?

11:41.070 --> 11:44.830
86.5% is still a human.

11:44.870 --> 11:47.590
None of you is human.

11:48.710 --> 11:50.590
Never was.

12:07.950 --> 12:10.830
You have no idea
what's going on here...

12:10.830 --> 12:13.670
What this is really all about.

12:14.470 --> 12:16.350
When i'm through with you,
there's no way

12:16.430 --> 12:18.470
they'll be able to put
you back together.

12:18.510 --> 12:21.230
I'm here to tell you
you're finished.

12:21.230 --> 12:23.030
You lose.

12:24.070 --> 12:25.150
Adios.

12:28.910 --> 12:30.790
God, ohh-hh!

12:30.830 --> 12:32.830
This is the Los Angeles

12:32.870 --> 12:34.750
police department.

12:34.750 --> 12:36.510
You are surrounded.

12:36.670 --> 12:40.430
I order the occupants
of building 4-0-8-7

12:40.470 --> 12:43.190
to exit that building

12:43.190 --> 12:46.070
and surrender to police authorities.

12:46.110 --> 12:47.950
Drop your weapons

12:47.990 --> 12:50.150
and exit with your hands up...
Now.

12:57.590 --> 12:59.590
We'll start by replacing his eyes.

12:59.590 --> 13:01.630
Respiration scans read critical.

13:01.670 --> 13:03.550
Human organs are at 9.8.

13:04.390 --> 13:06.310
Fluid levels, 18.2.

13:06.390 --> 13:08.150
You're not really human.

13:08.310 --> 13:10.150
Mostly machine...
You're not really human.

13:10.310 --> 13:12.190
You're mostly machine...
You're not really human.

13:12.230 --> 13:14.870
You're not really human anymore,
are you?

13:14.870 --> 13:16.750
Or are you?

13:27.350 --> 13:28.430
It took them six months

13:28.470 --> 13:30.350
to put him back together.

13:30.390 --> 13:35.150
Synthetic flesh,
bio-engineered organs.

13:35.190 --> 13:38.870
It always scared him that they
might take out his soul,

13:38.870 --> 13:40.910
and replace it with
some matrix chip.

13:43.670 --> 13:45.710
After the techs were
done with his body,

13:45.750 --> 13:48.470
they shipped him to Baja.

14:02.990 --> 14:05.710
He ended up in this
godforsaken refuge

14:05.710 --> 14:07.630
on the edge of existence.

14:07.630 --> 14:09.550
The kind of place where
people on the run

14:09.590 --> 14:11.470
go to be forgotten.

14:18.190 --> 14:20.110
He was there to recuperate.

14:53.870 --> 14:55.710
Cerveza, por favor.

15:52.190 --> 15:54.070
Mind if I sit down?

15:58.030 --> 15:59.950
I am Rosaria.

16:01.750 --> 16:03.630
I'm not looking for company, lady.

16:05.670 --> 16:06.750
I can see that, senor.

16:06.750 --> 16:09.550
I've seen you around.

16:09.630 --> 16:12.350
Not too many gringos
come down here

16:12.390 --> 16:13.470
without some kind of...

16:14.310 --> 16:16.190
sad story.

16:16.230 --> 16:19.110
No one's here without
some kind of story.

16:19.150 --> 16:22.790
Relax.
I won't give awa Y your hideout.

16:24.910 --> 16:26.630
What do you want?

16:26.670 --> 16:28.670
I want to get even.

16:28.710 --> 16:29.510
Even?

16:29.670 --> 16:32.550
With who, senor?

16:33.390 --> 16:34.510
You, terrorist.

16:34.550 --> 16:36.430
- Oh, shit!
- Remember L.A.?

16:37.390 --> 16:39.150
Hey!

16:47.790 --> 16:49.710
He wanted to tell this terrorist

16:49.710 --> 16:50.790
that he had given
a lot of thought

16:51.630 --> 16:53.550
to what she said back in L.A.

16:53.550 --> 16:57.350
About whether he was
more machine than human.

16:57.390 --> 17:00.270
He wanted to tell her
she started him thinking.

17:00.270 --> 17:03.150
I know he really wanted
to tell her all this.

17:04.270 --> 17:07.109
But she was dead.

17:07.150 --> 17:09.030
So instead he sat there
listening to the sound

17:09.069 --> 17:10.950
of approaching engines.

17:10.990 --> 17:13.670
The kind of turbo engines
we use in our vehicles

17:13.710 --> 17:14.869
at L.A.P.D.

17:16.790 --> 17:20.390
Not bad, but a little sloppy,
Alex.

17:25.190 --> 17:27.230
Looks like you're ready
to go back to work.

17:37.790 --> 17:40.510
The cyber transplants
have really taken to you.

17:45.310 --> 17:47.350
Can't tell what's real
and what's synthetic.

17:52.030 --> 17:54.070
- You'll be all machine soon.
- Shut up, Pam.

17:57.790 --> 17:59.670
Pack up, Alex.
Rehab's over.

17:59.950 --> 18:01.830
Farnsworth wants you back online.

18:03.790 --> 18:05.670
I quit, and you tell
Farnsworth that.

18:07.550 --> 18:08.470
And if he doesn't like it,

18:08.550 --> 18:10.430
I know he will find me
and let me know.

18:19.110 --> 18:20.870
To stop the pain.

18:20.910 --> 18:22.830
She's right,
nothing is mine anymore.

18:23.670 --> 18:26.550
Nothing's been mine
since I met you, Jared.

18:27.710 --> 18:29.590
I didn't force you to enlist.

18:29.630 --> 18:33.350
You and Farnsworth did not
give me much choice, did you?

18:33.390 --> 18:37.150
We got you out of prison.
That was the deal.

18:37.230 --> 18:38.950
What's wrong, Alex?

18:39.110 --> 18:42.910
You want me to tell Farnsworth
he misjudged you?

18:42.950 --> 18:45.790
That I misjudged you?

18:45.950 --> 18:47.830
You can't handle the job,
you've lost the edge.

18:48.710 --> 18:49.830
You've become too emotional.

18:50.510 --> 18:53.350
I can't feel anything anymore.

18:54.510 --> 18:57.190
You turned me into
a fucking machine.

18:58.350 --> 19:01.190
I don't know what's
right or wrong.

19:01.230 --> 19:03.190
Since when did you care?

19:07.030 --> 19:08.910
Maybe you should take the time

19:08.950 --> 19:11.750
to find out what you
care about, Alex.

19:13.670 --> 19:15.430
I cared about you, once.

19:15.590 --> 19:18.470
- I'm synthetic.
- That's right.

19:18.510 --> 19:20.310
And i thought you were real.

19:20.350 --> 19:23.190
Well, I never said I wasn't.

19:23.230 --> 19:24.270
Look,

19:25.110 --> 19:27.190
there's a lot of us
working to make

19:27.190 --> 19:30.790
a bad world better.
Remember that.

19:30.830 --> 19:32.710
What do you care about
a better world?

19:32.750 --> 19:35.550
You're a cyborg.

19:39.510 --> 19:41.550
I live here, too.

20:08.230 --> 20:10.110
That was unnecessary.

20:10.150 --> 20:12.030
We'll never
get him back now.

20:20.870 --> 20:23.590
I'll give Farnsworth
the bad news.

21:07.710 --> 21:10.550
The next year was
as grim as it gets.

21:10.710 --> 21:12.590
He slipped into the
black market network

21:12.630 --> 21:15.350
that thrived in
the New Rio grid.

21:15.390 --> 21:17.270
He wanted to try his hand
at smuggling,

21:17.430 --> 21:19.190
but he really didn't
have the knack for it.

21:19.350 --> 21:21.110
His deals...
When he could get them...

21:21.270 --> 21:23.990
Usually ended up with
someone getting dead.

21:23.990 --> 21:26.910
Not the best thing
for staying in business.

21:27.110 --> 21:28.990
Just when he was about
to give up on Brazil,

21:29.030 --> 21:31.870
he got word this morning
some hotshot systems cowboy

21:31.870 --> 21:33.750
wanted to see him.

21:33.790 --> 21:36.590
The systems cowboy went
by the name Marion Face.

21:37.430 --> 21:38.510
He had some japanese tech

21:39.350 --> 21:40.430
that wanted to switch corporations.

21:41.270 --> 21:44.310
The tech needed safe passage
through the electronic web.

21:45.110 --> 21:46.190
A perfect setup for Alex.

21:49.950 --> 21:51.830
It's about time, Marion.

21:53.710 --> 21:55.750
You know you're making a
simple deal very complicated.

21:55.790 --> 21:58.670
Are you enjoying your
retirement, Alex?

21:58.710 --> 22:01.350
Still glad you quit
being a cop?

22:06.150 --> 22:08.230
I hear you've been dealing
out on the line.

22:10.030 --> 22:11.950
You've blown a lot of
transactions, Alex.

22:11.950 --> 22:14.950
Your rep in the Brazil
triad is shit.

22:14.990 --> 22:17.630
You're lucky I even
took a chance on you.

22:17.830 --> 22:20.750
So where's the japanese tech
with the chip?

22:20.750 --> 22:23.470
He'll be here.
Relax.

22:23.630 --> 22:25.390
Well...

22:25.430 --> 22:27.310
Help me relax, Marion.

22:29.270 --> 22:31.150
Pull your hands out
of your pockets,

22:31.190 --> 22:33.030
where i can see them.

22:33.070 --> 22:34.950
See?

22:34.990 --> 22:37.830
There's nothing
up my sleeves, Alex.

22:44.750 --> 22:48.390
Don't worry, Alex.
You're not gonna die.

22:48.430 --> 22:50.470
L.A.P.D. will put you
back together.

22:50.510 --> 22:52.390
They want you for an assignment.

23:16.430 --> 23:18.310
Farnsworth is here.

23:19.310 --> 23:21.190
Let's go.

23:25.830 --> 23:27.710
I also understand the
situation in Rio

23:27.830 --> 23:29.590
was quite messy.

23:32.510 --> 23:33.590
What are you talking about?

23:34.430 --> 23:35.510
I saw the reports.

23:35.510 --> 23:39.190
- How is that possible?
- I have my sources, you know.

23:39.350 --> 23:42.070
You have some nerve
looking into this.

23:47.030 --> 23:48.790
Commissioner.

23:48.950 --> 23:50.830
Gentlemen.

24:11.790 --> 24:13.910
He used to be one
of my best ops.

24:14.870 --> 24:16.790
Get him out of there.

24:19.630 --> 24:22.350
So I'm still alive
for a reason, right?

24:27.310 --> 24:30.190
You're too valuable to let go.
I knew I might need you,

24:30.190 --> 24:32.910
so we allowed you to retire.
How was it?

24:32.910 --> 24:34.950
Pretty fuckin' desperate, huh?

24:34.990 --> 24:37.830
You're only good
at one thing, Alex.

24:37.870 --> 24:39.750
It's all you'll
ever be good at.

24:39.790 --> 24:42.470
You see that now, I think.

24:42.510 --> 24:45.510
I hope you do, because
I need Your skills again.

24:45.550 --> 24:47.430
And what makes you think
I would help you?

24:47.470 --> 24:50.310
Because when they put you
back together last week,

24:50.350 --> 24:52.230
they added a little something.

24:52.270 --> 24:53.990
Your heart...
A bomb.

24:54.190 --> 24:56.910
Enough to make you disappear.

25:01.710 --> 25:03.590
You're living on
their time now.

25:03.630 --> 25:05.550
So how do I stay alive,
commissioner?

25:05.590 --> 25:07.630
The american president and
the prime minister of Japan

25:07.670 --> 25:10.390
are meeting in L.A.
in three days.

25:10.550 --> 25:13.270
The security plans for the
summit have been stolen.

25:13.270 --> 25:15.310
I'd like to keep it quiet.
I can't use anyone

25:16.030 --> 25:17.230
in our department to
retrieve the disks...

25:17.950 --> 25:19.150
Too many goddamn japanese around.

25:19.870 --> 25:21.990
Ever since the U.S.
and Japan merged,

25:22.030 --> 25:24.870
it's been a fight to...

25:24.910 --> 25:26.790
keep down these slant-eyed
bastards.

25:26.830 --> 25:30.470
This is the kind of power play
they are looking for

25:30.510 --> 25:32.550
to get rid of the commissioner.

25:35.430 --> 25:37.310
I need you, Alex.
I've been saving you

25:37.390 --> 25:40.070
for something like this.

25:40.110 --> 25:42.150
Sandrakes is good.

25:42.150 --> 25:43.910
We're wasting our time,
commissioner.

25:44.070 --> 25:45.990
He's just a speed-loader now.

25:46.030 --> 25:48.750
Listen to your queer,
he's right, I can't do it.

25:48.750 --> 25:50.670
Alex, you want to know

25:50.670 --> 25:52.590
who has stolen the security plan?

25:52.590 --> 25:56.390
Your ex-boss, your ex-lover.

25:59.310 --> 26:00.390
Jared?

26:01.230 --> 26:05.030
That synthetic bitch
turned on us.

26:06.030 --> 26:07.950
Gone renegade.

26:07.950 --> 26:10.670
She's selling plans to a...

26:10.830 --> 26:14.630
terrorist organization,
"The Red Army Hammerheads."

26:14.670 --> 26:16.590
Jared is hiding out in Java,

26:16.590 --> 26:19.590
a low-tech shithole
called Shang-Loo...

26:20.430 --> 26:23.270
That is part of the
Southwest Asian Hui.

26:23.310 --> 26:26.310
Some second-class cyborg...
What's the name?

26:26.350 --> 26:29.990
- Julian.
- Julian is fronting for her.

26:30.030 --> 26:32.070
We know Jared's going
to meet with...

26:32.070 --> 26:35.710
The leader...
Hammerheads.

26:35.790 --> 26:37.670
We don't know
who the leader is,

26:37.710 --> 26:39.510
what he or she looks like.

26:39.550 --> 26:43.350
But if you will bring back both,

26:43.390 --> 26:46.230
- We can...
- You go and get them.

26:46.390 --> 26:48.190
We want you to do it, Alex.

26:48.190 --> 26:50.070
You've got the experience.
You know Jared.

26:50.110 --> 26:51.990
You could talk her into giving up.

26:52.030 --> 26:54.070
Convince the goddamn cyborg
to correct her error.

26:55.790 --> 26:57.830
Why did Jared steal the plan?

26:57.870 --> 26:59.750
Go to Shang-Loo and
find out for us.

27:00.750 --> 27:03.590
Forget it.

27:07.310 --> 27:09.350
You know the cliche,
you racist asshole?

27:09.390 --> 27:11.350
What's that?

27:13.110 --> 27:14.990
"Pull it, and you'd better use it."

27:15.030 --> 27:16.910
Give me an excuse.

27:17.870 --> 27:18.950
Heh.

27:20.910 --> 27:22.790
How's that one?

27:25.550 --> 27:26.630
You haven't lost the edge, Alex.

27:26.630 --> 27:28.590
Find someone else.

27:29.430 --> 27:32.390
Remember the bomb in
your heart, Alex!

27:32.430 --> 27:36.230
You've got three days.
The clock is running.

27:36.270 --> 27:38.190
Take this one last assignment,

27:38.190 --> 27:40.110
as a favor to me,

27:40.110 --> 27:42.030
and I'll set you up,
on a real retirement

27:42.030 --> 27:44.750
with all the money and
junk you could want.

27:55.310 --> 27:56.430
He'll be here in a moment.

27:56.470 --> 27:58.350
I think he accepted the story.

27:59.190 --> 28:00.950
By the time he learns the truth,
it'll be too late.

28:01.150 --> 28:02.910
You still believe
he can manage this?

28:03.070 --> 28:04.830
He won't have to do much.

28:04.870 --> 28:06.750
If he can walk, that's enough.

28:06.910 --> 28:09.750
Besides, Jared won't let
anyone else get near her.

28:10.630 --> 28:12.510
There's no guarantee
he'll try to find Jared.

28:12.590 --> 28:14.630
He won't have a choice.

28:14.630 --> 28:16.390
How's that?

28:16.430 --> 28:19.230
I've sent Billy Moon to Shang-Loo.

28:19.230 --> 28:21.110
Alex won't have to find Jared.

28:23.070 --> 28:24.150
Billy will make sure
she finds him.

28:42.350 --> 28:44.270
Get him cleaned up.

29:07.190 --> 29:09.070
Shang-Loo, christ.

29:25.390 --> 29:27.350
Immigration, asshole.

29:35.230 --> 29:37.110
What do you see?

29:38.950 --> 29:40.830
What's out there, Billy?

29:40.870 --> 29:42.910
Nothing.

29:42.910 --> 29:44.790
Just another tourist.

30:03.790 --> 30:05.830
Undercover.

30:45.110 --> 30:46.190
Ah.

30:46.190 --> 30:48.110
Good.

30:53.830 --> 30:56.550
Just another tourist, Billy?

30:59.590 --> 31:02.430
I told you L.A.P.D.
is sending a shark...

31:06.310 --> 31:08.190
...to stop me.

31:11.910 --> 31:14.950
Sharks come in all shapes
and sizes, Billy.

31:16.710 --> 31:18.590
I told you that, didn't I?

31:21.670 --> 31:23.550
Okay.

31:25.510 --> 31:28.230
What are you gonna do about it?

31:28.230 --> 31:30.110
Nothing, Billy.

31:30.310 --> 31:32.190
Nothing for now.

31:43.630 --> 31:46.510
Did I tell you how much
I appreciate all the help

31:46.550 --> 31:49.390
you've given me and Jared,
Billy?

31:49.430 --> 31:51.310
Did I thank you?

32:32.430 --> 32:35.270
Ah, welcome to Shang-Loo, mister.

32:35.310 --> 32:37.390
I am Yoshiro Han, proprietor

32:37.430 --> 32:39.310
of the Shang-Loo hotel.

32:39.350 --> 32:42.070
Room for one. How much?

32:42.070 --> 32:44.070
5000 yen a night, for...

32:44.070 --> 32:45.950
a regular suite.

32:45.990 --> 32:48.710
However, a view of the volcano

32:48.750 --> 32:50.790
can be yours for a measly
10,000 yen.

32:51.790 --> 32:54.470
How much is 10,000 yen
in american?

32:54.670 --> 32:56.590
I'm terribly sorry, mister.
We only accept yen.

32:56.590 --> 32:58.510
American is so very...
How you say?

32:58.510 --> 33:00.390
Questionable, yes?

33:00.430 --> 33:02.310
I'd better pass on that volcano.

33:09.030 --> 33:10.910
What do you want, mister?

33:10.990 --> 33:13.670
Someone in particular?

33:13.710 --> 33:15.630
It's a busy time of year.

33:15.630 --> 33:17.590
Lot of visitors.

33:20.510 --> 33:23.230
Alex Rain?

33:23.270 --> 33:27.070
Good fake name, yeah?

33:29.070 --> 33:30.990
Give me the key.

33:30.990 --> 33:33.830
Up the stairs, fifth
door on the right.

33:33.870 --> 33:35.750
And if you like,
I can arrange guided tour

33:35.790 --> 33:37.830
of the volcano, mister.

33:43.390 --> 33:45.310
Yoshiro.

33:52.110 --> 33:54.950
Alex Rain.
Is he the one, Angie-san?

33:54.990 --> 33:57.950
Easy enough to find out, no?

33:59.750 --> 34:03.550
Hey!
What's the matter you?

34:57.510 --> 34:59.270
No more of their drugs.

34:59.270 --> 35:01.310
If Farnsworth is going
to kill me tomorrow,

35:01.310 --> 35:04.150
I want to be clear.

35:06.110 --> 35:09.790
I hope Jared really
hurts L.A.P.D.,

35:09.830 --> 35:11.870
I really do.

35:11.870 --> 35:15.550
She can sell her data to the
dog boys for all I care.

35:15.590 --> 35:16.510
Damn.

35:27.110 --> 35:29.950
He's a fuckin' speed-loader.

35:31.830 --> 35:34.830
Huh. Maybe he's not the shark,
Julian.

35:36.790 --> 35:38.670
What do you think, Billy?

35:38.710 --> 35:41.310
You think he's a shark?

35:44.190 --> 35:46.150
I don't think they'd
send a junkie.

35:46.190 --> 35:48.110
Not on something this important.

35:48.110 --> 35:50.030
It worries me, especially

35:50.030 --> 35:52.910
with the exchange going
on this afternoon.

35:52.910 --> 35:55.870
Probably just here for
the goddamn volcano.

35:55.870 --> 35:57.750
I have to know.

36:01.550 --> 36:03.430
Relax, baby.

36:03.470 --> 36:06.310
I got you this far, right?

36:06.350 --> 36:08.390
I'll run over later.
I'll see if it's

36:08.430 --> 36:11.270
this cop Alex Rain you're
so concerned about.

36:12.110 --> 36:14.950
Hey, I got you this far...

36:16.910 --> 36:19.750
So relax.

36:19.790 --> 36:21.830
Look, kill him later.

36:21.830 --> 36:23.750
I want you to fuck me now.

36:25.710 --> 36:27.630
Why did you do that?

36:30.470 --> 36:32.350
You're insulting, Billy.

36:32.390 --> 36:34.270
Michelle!

36:35.270 --> 36:37.150
No, Julian...

36:37.990 --> 36:39.870
Julian, what the fuck
are you pulling, man?

36:39.910 --> 36:41.950
I thought we had a goddamn deal.

36:42.790 --> 36:43.870
I thought, uh...

36:43.910 --> 36:45.790
Come on!
Look, look now...

36:45.790 --> 36:49.390
Please, don't do this.
Damn it!

36:49.430 --> 36:51.470
We had a goddamn
motherfucking deal!

36:51.510 --> 36:55.150
I'm your fuckin' partner in this!

36:55.150 --> 36:57.070
I fuckin' set you up
in Shang-Loo,

36:57.070 --> 36:58.990
I helped your ass!

36:58.990 --> 37:01.150
We had a deal,
you plasmo-sucking bitch!

37:01.190 --> 37:03.070
Wait!

37:03.110 --> 37:05.830
You helped a little too much,
Billy.

37:06.830 --> 37:08.870
How does an out-of-town
hustler like you

37:08.870 --> 37:11.590
get the inside scoop
on undercover cops

37:11.630 --> 37:13.430
and terrorists?
Answer me that, huh?

37:13.590 --> 37:15.510
How does it happen?

37:20.150 --> 37:23.030
I was trying to help you, man.

37:23.070 --> 37:25.030
Too bad the sensor read
differently, Billy.

37:25.070 --> 37:26.950
Too bad for you

37:26.990 --> 37:29.830
it said you were L.A.P.D.

37:36.430 --> 37:38.350
Angie-san, Room 16.

37:46.190 --> 37:48.070
Room service.

37:53.790 --> 37:55.670
Hey, how's it, bro'?

37:55.710 --> 37:57.750
On behalf of the Shang-Loo
welcome wagon,

37:57.790 --> 38:01.470
I'd like to introduce my
right arm, Fran Terry.

38:01.470 --> 38:04.310
Angie-liv, yours truly.

38:05.430 --> 38:08.150
Leave me alone.

38:12.150 --> 38:14.870
I guess "leave me alone"
means something different here.

38:15.030 --> 38:16.910
Or are you too stupid to get it?

38:16.950 --> 38:19.790
Bugger get smart mouth, eh?

38:20.790 --> 38:22.670
Like that in a victim.

38:29.270 --> 38:32.270
Make it easy on yourself, bro'.
I'm the boss here.

38:32.310 --> 38:35.150
Anybody smart mouth in Shang-Loo,

38:35.150 --> 38:37.030
only if I say.

38:37.070 --> 38:39.750
What are you looking for?

38:39.750 --> 38:42.750
No, no.
I ask the questions, Boy-san.

38:53.310 --> 38:56.030
So why you here, brother?

38:58.110 --> 38:59.870
To see the volcano.

39:01.870 --> 39:04.710
Look, make it easy on yourself,
bro'.

39:04.750 --> 39:07.750
I can find a place on you
that's still human.

39:07.790 --> 39:10.470
Where you can still
feel something, eh?

39:23.830 --> 39:26.670
I'm just looking for someone,
okay?

39:26.710 --> 39:29.710
The cyborg from old California.
Jared, yeah?

39:31.630 --> 39:35.310
Yeah, we hear she stole
something from the L.A.P.D.

39:36.430 --> 39:39.310
What, they wan' send you
down here to stop her

39:39.310 --> 39:42.030
before she sells something
to those terrorists?

39:43.150 --> 39:45.190
The Red Army Hammerheads?

39:45.870 --> 39:49.030
Since you know so much,
maybe you can tell me

39:49.710 --> 39:50.870
how to find Jared?

39:52.830 --> 39:54.590
Hey bro', why?

39:54.590 --> 39:57.430
Look like missing
persons to you?

39:57.470 --> 39:59.470
Hey, The Hammerheads,
what you think of them, man?

39:59.510 --> 40:03.310
- I don't.
- Hammerheads are rebels, yeah?

40:03.350 --> 40:05.190
They freedom fighters
trying to stop

40:05.310 --> 40:07.190
the spread of information systems.

40:08.070 --> 40:10.910
The cyborg computers who will try

40:10.950 --> 40:12.990
to enslave civilization.

40:12.990 --> 40:16.670
Think of themselves as
protectors of humankind.

40:16.710 --> 40:20.550
You know, maybe you're
one smart cop.

40:20.590 --> 40:23.430
Maybe too smart for cop, brother.

40:23.430 --> 40:26.270
Maybe, just maybe,

40:27.150 --> 40:29.190
you're one sharp motherfucker.

40:31.110 --> 40:34.790
That's a lot of maybes.

40:34.830 --> 40:36.750
Look stop it now, I'm
telling you the truth.

40:36.750 --> 40:38.670
Why, gaijin?

40:39.830 --> 40:42.510
Because i'm going to
be dead in two days.

40:42.550 --> 40:44.510
I've got something inside me.

40:44.510 --> 40:46.390
- Oh, shit!
- Inside you? Bomb, yeah?

40:46.590 --> 40:50.230
Yeah, that's right.
When I get close to Jared.

40:50.230 --> 40:54.030
I got a feeling I'm going
to become colorfull.

40:54.070 --> 40:55.870
So stop fucking with me!

40:55.950 --> 40:57.830
Surgery by surgery, brother.

40:58.790 --> 41:00.870
Getting more machine than human.

41:00.910 --> 41:03.590
How you feel about that?

41:04.750 --> 41:06.630
I didn't have any choice.

41:06.670 --> 41:09.350
Sad, yeah?

41:11.470 --> 41:14.190
At least I'm still alive.

41:14.190 --> 41:17.070
Won't make any difference
you no care, brother.

41:19.030 --> 41:20.910
Just make sure you
stay away from me,

41:20.990 --> 41:22.870
in case your bomb get accident.

41:51.790 --> 41:53.670
Next time...

41:55.470 --> 41:57.510
...I kill all of you motherfuckers.

41:57.550 --> 41:59.430
Ling-kun,

41:59.470 --> 42:01.350
Let's go get plate lunch.

42:10.030 --> 42:11.910
Hey Julian, who the fuck
are these guys?

42:11.950 --> 42:13.670
Who cares?

42:28.190 --> 42:29.150
Oooh!

42:43.470 --> 42:46.150
You're not the maid, are you?

43:09.270 --> 43:12.110
Bring him in here, Michelle!

43:12.270 --> 43:14.990
Did you hear what I said?
He's checked out.

43:21.870 --> 43:24.550
It only works if you
load it, stupid.

43:27.510 --> 43:29.430
Thanks for the tip.

43:31.390 --> 43:33.270
Michelle...

43:39.990 --> 43:41.870
Jared said you were
someone I could trust.

43:42.070 --> 43:44.950
She said you were...
Different.

43:45.790 --> 43:47.670
Who the hell are you?

43:47.670 --> 43:48.750
Someone that can help
you find Jared.

43:48.790 --> 43:51.510
I apologize for Michelle's
unorthodox methods,

43:51.510 --> 43:52.590
but I needed to run
a scan on you,

43:53.430 --> 43:54.510
with a respirator sensor,

43:54.550 --> 43:56.430
just to make sure Jared
wasn't overly optimistic

43:57.270 --> 43:58.270
about your allegiance.

43:58.310 --> 44:00.070
I don't really care
what your scan says...

44:00.270 --> 44:01.990
We can't really talk.

44:02.030 --> 44:03.910
Farnsworth's got a
surveillance unit

44:03.950 --> 44:05.030
implanted in your right eye.

44:05.030 --> 44:06.910
He can hear and see
everything you do.

44:06.950 --> 44:09.670
So you want me to
tear out my eyeball?

44:09.710 --> 44:11.590
Jared came up with

44:11.590 --> 44:13.470
a slightly less drastic measure.

44:15.590 --> 44:18.270
- I trusted Jared once...
- Yeah, and she betrayed you.

44:18.430 --> 44:20.310
- Yeah, she betrayed me...
- She did it for a good reason!

44:20.350 --> 44:21.270
It wasn't her reason.

44:22.110 --> 44:24.950
There is more at stake
than your feelings.

44:24.990 --> 44:26.870
There always was.
Are you gonna help us?

44:26.910 --> 44:30.870
You're a goddamned cyborg.
Why should I help you?

44:30.910 --> 44:34.550
And you're a pathetic,
fucking speed-loader!

44:34.590 --> 44:36.470
I don't want to depend on you!

44:36.510 --> 44:38.550
I don't want to have
to rely on you!

44:38.550 --> 44:42.350
Jared gave up her life
believing we needed you.

44:43.190 --> 44:44.310
So she's dead?

44:44.350 --> 44:48.030
Look, are you going
to trust me, Alex?

44:48.070 --> 44:50.110
There's no more fucking time!

44:54.030 --> 44:54.950
Okay, do it.

44:54.990 --> 44:56.870
All right, Alex.

44:56.910 --> 44:59.750
- Now this is gonna...
- Sting a little? I know.

44:59.790 --> 45:01.670
No, actually,

45:01.710 --> 45:03.430
it's gonna hurt like a motherfucker.

45:03.630 --> 45:05.350
Just do it.

45:16.070 --> 45:18.790
Hold still!

45:22.510 --> 45:24.670
We're busted.
Let's go pick them up.

46:05.710 --> 46:08.710
You know, she's not really dead.

46:08.710 --> 46:10.470
- What do you mean?
- Jared was caught leaving L.A.

46:10.670 --> 46:12.430
She suffered major wounds
to her housing.

46:12.430 --> 46:15.390
Her body died a few hours
after she got here.

46:15.470 --> 46:17.230
So she's gone?

46:17.390 --> 46:20.070
Her body is, but not her data.

46:20.070 --> 46:21.190
Jared's mind and soul, Alex.

46:21.270 --> 46:24.110
The database was transferred
to her memory banks.

46:24.150 --> 46:25.910
Take Jared

46:25.910 --> 46:27.790
to The Red Army Hammerheads.

46:27.830 --> 46:29.870
A meeting's been set for
today at sundown,

46:29.870 --> 46:31.790
on top of the volcano.

46:31.790 --> 46:33.710
They'll wait there
until the sun vanishes,

46:33.710 --> 46:36.590
then they're gone.
And with them,

46:36.590 --> 46:38.470
our best chance to stop Farnsworth.

46:46.910 --> 46:48.950
All units, move to preset positions.

46:49.790 --> 46:50.870
Scan coordinates

46:50.910 --> 46:52.670
for any terrorist support activity.

47:03.230 --> 47:06.070
Welcome to Shang-Loo, gentlemen.

47:06.110 --> 47:08.110
Why did Jared do this?

47:08.150 --> 47:10.030
Ask her yourself.

47:10.030 --> 47:11.910
Plug her into this computer.

47:11.950 --> 47:13.870
You'll be able to talk to her.

47:21.630 --> 47:23.510
Team two, report.

47:23.550 --> 47:25.310
Team two in position.

47:31.030 --> 47:32.110
You know I've got

47:32.150 --> 47:34.030
an encoded explosive in my heart?

47:42.590 --> 47:45.510
That will scramble the signals
they try to send the bomb.

47:45.550 --> 47:49.190
You're safe for now.
As they decode the jammer,

47:49.230 --> 47:50.270
the lights go out.

47:50.350 --> 47:52.390
When all five are gone...
Boom.

47:52.390 --> 47:54.270
Why did you need me?

47:55.150 --> 47:57.110
Jared said you were the best.

47:57.150 --> 47:59.990
That you'd have a better chance
of making it.

48:00.030 --> 48:01.910
Why are you helping Jared?

48:01.950 --> 48:04.630
I want to matter.

48:04.670 --> 48:06.710
I want it to mean something
that I lived.

48:07.550 --> 48:09.430
Isn't that what life's all about?

48:10.590 --> 48:13.350
They are trapped...
Sitting ducks.

48:13.390 --> 48:14.310
Ah.

48:18.030 --> 48:20.070
Team three, report.

48:20.110 --> 48:21.990
Team three set.

48:22.030 --> 48:23.910
On your command, lockup will
commence in 15 seconds.

48:28.710 --> 48:29.630
We can get out the back way,

48:30.510 --> 48:31.590
through the bathroom window.

48:34.590 --> 48:36.470
Go on! Get out!
I'll cover you.

48:40.190 --> 48:41.270
Argh!

50:18.070 --> 50:19.830
Well, it's an exciting resort.

50:19.870 --> 50:21.830
A deep layer scan

50:21.870 --> 50:24.710
confirms that Jared was
in the room with Alex,

50:24.750 --> 50:26.630
commissioner.

50:27.470 --> 50:29.510
Julian must have Jared on disk.

50:29.550 --> 50:31.430
Shit!

50:31.470 --> 50:34.310
The jam on Alex's charge
is holding.

50:38.190 --> 50:40.870
The techs here say it will
take six to 12 hours

50:40.910 --> 50:42.830
to decode the scrambler
Julian put in him.

50:42.830 --> 50:44.750
We haven't got six hours.

50:44.750 --> 50:46.670
The Hammerheads, they could have
the data by then.

50:46.670 --> 50:48.550
Ja.

50:50.670 --> 50:53.510
Sam, look at this.

51:13.750 --> 51:15.470
Julian, wait.

51:15.630 --> 51:18.350
I believe you've left
something behind.

51:30.990 --> 51:32.870
Wait, Julian, here.

51:33.710 --> 51:34.670
Let me help.

51:48.110 --> 51:49.190
You've already erased your
memory banks.

51:49.230 --> 51:51.110
Disciplined to the last.

51:51.950 --> 51:53.830
But there's nothing I want
in your auxiliary program.

51:53.870 --> 51:56.910
You'll be found out soon.

51:58.830 --> 52:01.510
Not if we kill everyone that knows.

52:01.550 --> 52:04.510
You always were

52:04.550 --> 52:06.430
an extremist, Sam.

52:06.470 --> 52:09.390
You were a shitty cyborg.

52:11.190 --> 52:13.070
You were never one of us.

52:13.070 --> 52:14.950
Killing all the humans...

52:14.990 --> 52:16.990
Isn't going to make you
any more real.

52:19.750 --> 52:20.830
I am real.

52:20.830 --> 52:22.630
Commissioner,

52:22.670 --> 52:24.550
we got a little trace image

52:24.590 --> 52:26.470
from the hotel's recorder.

52:26.510 --> 52:28.390
Not much, but have a look.

52:30.470 --> 52:33.190
Take Jared to The Red Army
Hammerheads.

52:33.390 --> 52:34.310
A meeting's been set...

52:35.150 --> 52:36.070
Hey, Sam...

52:37.990 --> 52:39.070
I'll be back.

52:39.110 --> 52:40.990
I don't think so.

52:48.590 --> 52:51.470
That's it.
The sound is ionized.

52:53.390 --> 52:55.310
Alex has Jared with him.

52:55.310 --> 52:58.030
We've got him now.

52:59.150 --> 53:01.070
If the techs can decode the jammer.

53:01.070 --> 53:04.030
This agent has a knack
for survival, hasn't he?

53:04.750 --> 53:06.630
Developed quite a reputation

53:06.670 --> 53:07.750
while he was online, eh?

53:08.590 --> 53:10.790
Alex Rain will be destroyed,
somehow, some way.

53:10.790 --> 53:12.550
He's human, after all.

53:12.710 --> 53:13.630
We'll track him on foot.

53:14.510 --> 53:15.550
He'll try to meet with
the hammerheads.

53:16.430 --> 53:18.310
Billy said it was going
to happen that way.

53:19.310 --> 53:21.190
We'll find the rest.

53:25.070 --> 53:26.950
Well, I hope so.

53:50.950 --> 53:53.670
Jared, can you hear me?

53:59.590 --> 54:01.470
Welcome to Shang-Loo.

54:01.510 --> 54:03.310
Is julian with you?

54:03.310 --> 54:06.230
No. Why did you turn
against L.A.P.D.?

54:06.390 --> 54:08.190
You believed in them.

54:08.230 --> 54:09.990
Not against L.A.P. D...

54:10.150 --> 54:11.910
Against...

54:11.910 --> 54:13.790
Commissioner Farnsworth.

54:13.830 --> 54:15.910
So he's not the nicest guy
in the whole world...

54:16.750 --> 54:18.790
No. Commissioner Farnsworth
has been replaced.

54:18.830 --> 54:20.750
What do you mean, "replaced"?

54:20.750 --> 54:22.670
I just saw him down in Baja.

54:22.670 --> 54:25.470
You saw a cyborg duplicate.

54:25.470 --> 54:27.470
He's dead.
Killed a month ago.

54:27.510 --> 54:31.110
The cyborg was retro-cloned
into a perfect,

54:31.150 --> 54:33.190
cell-for-cell duplicate
of Farnsworth.

54:33.230 --> 54:36.990
Impossible to detect
with existing scans.

54:37.030 --> 54:39.750
State of the art.

54:39.750 --> 54:43.550
They intend to replace
humans with cyborgs.

54:43.590 --> 54:45.470
Which humans?

54:45.510 --> 54:46.630
All humans, Alex.

54:46.670 --> 54:50.310
They have to be stopped,
before they start a war

54:50.470 --> 54:52.390
between cyborgs and humankind.

54:52.430 --> 54:54.270
You're a cyborg.

54:55.070 --> 54:56.150
Why don't you side with them?

54:57.030 --> 54:59.910
- They are wrong.
- And that's it?

54:59.910 --> 55:01.790
Isn't that enough?

55:02.950 --> 55:04.710
We've got him in sector six.

55:04.750 --> 55:06.590
- There he is!
- Get him!

55:09.670 --> 55:11.550
Give it up!

56:06.190 --> 56:07.950
Alex!

56:07.950 --> 56:08.870
Fuck you!

56:08.910 --> 56:11.910
- What?
- Not you, Jared.

56:18.670 --> 56:21.390
Come on, I want an
answer out of you!

56:21.430 --> 56:22.550
Where is he?

56:22.590 --> 56:24.350
No, no, no.

56:24.390 --> 56:25.390
Have you seen him?!

56:37.710 --> 56:38.870
Please, don't shoot!

56:39.710 --> 56:40.630
No more, please!

56:47.310 --> 56:49.190
Teach you to fuck with me,

56:49.350 --> 56:51.270
you fucking cyborgs!

56:54.990 --> 56:57.030
Streets aren't safe anymore.

56:57.030 --> 56:58.790
Can't even go to the market

56:58.950 --> 57:00.870
Without meeting some punk.

57:02.870 --> 57:05.590
Shang-Loo takes no shit.

57:08.430 --> 57:09.510
I love this town.

57:10.350 --> 57:12.390
Alex?

57:12.390 --> 57:14.310
I stole data on labs
doing the cloning,

57:14.350 --> 57:16.230
and who's been duplicated so far.

57:16.270 --> 57:19.030
The Hammerheads can destroy
labs and duplicates.

57:19.870 --> 57:20.950
The cyborgs sent you, Alex.

57:20.990 --> 57:22.870
You were their only chance
to locate me.

57:22.910 --> 57:25.630
They planted that dermo-bomb
in you,

57:25.630 --> 57:27.510
Hoping you'd get close
enough to me

57:27.670 --> 57:30.430
to take us both out.

57:30.470 --> 57:33.390
But Julian planted
the jammer in you.

57:34.510 --> 57:38.310
Farnsworth techs are
working now to decode it.

57:40.110 --> 57:41.190
There isn't much time left...

57:42.030 --> 57:43.110
For either of us.

57:43.950 --> 57:46.950
Jared, who's the leader
Of the Hammerheads?

57:46.950 --> 57:48.870
I don't know.

57:50.790 --> 57:53.510
You know, I don't know why
I'm helping you, Jared.

57:53.550 --> 57:55.430
Because you know what's right...

57:55.430 --> 57:56.510
And what's wrong,

57:56.550 --> 57:58.430
and you care.

57:58.430 --> 58:00.110
Yeah.

58:05.110 --> 58:06.870
For what it's worth, Alex...

58:07.830 --> 58:09.710
I loved you.

58:09.790 --> 58:12.630
Yeah, terrific.
Cyborg love.

58:16.430 --> 58:18.310
It takes more than
flesh and blood

58:18.350 --> 58:20.230
to be human, Alex.

58:22.190 --> 58:24.270
I'll talk to you later,
Jared.

58:48.110 --> 58:49.150
Go on, I'll cover you.

58:50.270 --> 58:52.990
Move!
Let's go!

59:42.790 --> 59:44.830
I'm coming to get you, Alex.

59:53.510 --> 59:55.390
Shit, another 5%.

59:55.470 --> 59:59.150
Hold on, Jared,
I'll get you to the volcano.

01:00:44.190 --> 01:00:45.150
Heads up!

01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:03.390
You are a very energetic human.

01:01:30.310 --> 01:01:31.350
Follow me.

01:01:32.310 --> 01:01:34.070
Oh, fuck!

01:01:38.070 --> 01:01:38.990
Fuck!

01:01:39.030 --> 01:01:40.910
Who is that girl?

01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:55.710
Only three lights left.
Shit.

01:02:55.710 --> 01:02:58.550
Running out of time, huh?

01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:07.270
Goddamn L.A.P.D. assholes!

01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:09.990
The governor of Java,
he gives them permission

01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:11.070
to come here, and fugitive hunt,

01:03:11.110 --> 01:03:13.990
and then they think they can
blow the whole fucking place up!

01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:17.670
I saw you leave your room.

01:03:17.830 --> 01:03:19.750
Through the floor,
that's very slick.

01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:23.590
Who the fuck are you?

01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:25.470
Max Impact.

01:03:26.310 --> 01:03:27.390
Local guide.

01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:29.190
For the tourists, eh?

01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:31.110
Angie-san told me about you.

01:03:31.110 --> 01:03:33.030
He gave me your contract
of service.

01:03:33.030 --> 01:03:35.070
Does it really look like I'm
a tourist to you?

01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:38.790
Well, I've got to admit,

01:03:38.790 --> 01:03:40.710
the hotel deal threw me a little.

01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:42.750
Pretty radical escape, though.

01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:47.550
No matter what your business
is in Shang-Loo,

01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:49.470
you gonna need a guide, eh?

01:03:49.510 --> 01:03:51.270
I'm your girl.

01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:54.270
Please, Alex-san, come on.

01:03:54.310 --> 01:03:55.230
I really need the job.

01:03:55.270 --> 01:03:57.990
And you need my help too, no?

01:03:57.990 --> 01:04:00.870
Looks pretty busy in
Shang-Loo right now.

01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:02.790
Please, Alex-san, come on.

01:04:02.790 --> 01:04:04.590
You don't even have to tip me,

01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:06.550
or pay me the bump for
illegal acts, eh?

01:04:06.590 --> 01:04:09.470
You can even scan me
if you'd like.

01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:11.550
See if i'm telling you
the truth, huh?

01:05:01.390 --> 01:05:03.270
Sorry, Alex-san,

01:05:03.310 --> 01:05:05.190
But the big boss wanted to see you.

01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:07.110
And we know you not come,

01:05:07.110 --> 01:05:09.030
unless invited special-like, eh?

01:05:15.790 --> 01:05:18.510
Thought you were going
to leave me alone, Angie?

01:05:18.510 --> 01:05:22.430
Cyborgs really fuck things up,
yeah?

01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:30.910
Specially when they turn renegade

01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:33.030
and no tell nobody.

01:05:33.070 --> 01:05:35.670
So you know about Farnsworth?

01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:38.750
Like i told you, Alex-san...

01:05:40.510 --> 01:05:42.630
it's the information age,
brother.

01:05:44.510 --> 01:05:47.270
Relax, Alex.

01:05:54.030 --> 01:05:56.070
If I, like, steal
the disk from you,

01:05:56.790 --> 01:05:58.710
you never wake up, bro'.

01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:11.350
Take it as a sign of good faith.

01:06:12.230 --> 01:06:14.310
Good faith on what, Angie?

01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:22.830
I want you to help me.

01:06:32.350 --> 01:06:33.430
Your reputation as a hitter

01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:35.350
is quite renowned in the community.

01:06:37.310 --> 01:06:39.950
You have systems access
like nobody else.

01:06:41.070 --> 01:06:43.790
Who needs someone like you?

01:06:44.910 --> 01:06:46.670
The Hammerheads, huh?

01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:48.550
Yes.

01:06:48.590 --> 01:06:51.430
The last of them, Alex-san.

01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:55.390
I need your help With the cyborgs.

01:06:55.590 --> 01:06:57.350
They're replacing the humans
and we can't tell

01:06:57.390 --> 01:06:59.190
who's real and who's not.

01:06:59.230 --> 01:07:01.110
How can you trust him, Angie-san?

01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:03.110
He should die for what he's done!

01:07:17.470 --> 01:07:19.510
Max is right, Alex-san.

01:07:22.270 --> 01:07:25.110
You've done many terrible things.

01:07:25.150 --> 01:07:27.190
You killed her sister.

01:07:30.790 --> 01:07:33.670
Baja.
Last year.

01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:39.550
I thought I was enforcing the law.

01:07:40.350 --> 01:07:42.270
And what do you think now?

01:07:45.350 --> 01:07:47.110
Bomb!

01:07:47.110 --> 01:07:48.150
Get down, bro'!

01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:02.670
No die on me!

01:08:02.670 --> 01:08:06.310
Come on, cowboy,
Angie-san needs help.

01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:08.270
I thought you wanted me dead.

01:08:08.310 --> 01:08:10.350
Later! Right now, I need
you make others dead.

01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:29.510
Let's have that disk, Angie-san.

01:08:31.310 --> 01:08:33.310
No!

01:08:40.830 --> 01:08:41.910
Ah.

01:08:41.950 --> 01:08:44.670
You're the last of them,
Angie-san.

01:08:44.670 --> 01:08:46.710
No more Hammerhead bosses.

01:08:46.750 --> 01:08:50.390
I want you to die
knowing you've lost.

01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:52.470
It's over for the humans.

01:08:52.510 --> 01:08:55.229
Someone will come and replace me.

01:08:55.270 --> 01:08:56.350
There is no one else.

01:08:56.350 --> 01:08:58.229
I'll finish it right here and now.

01:09:00.029 --> 01:09:01.910
Fuck you.

01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:16.350
Ja, doc...

01:09:16.350 --> 01:09:18.229
I love to watch you work.

01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:25.990
Thanks a lot.

01:10:05.190 --> 01:10:07.230
It's over, Max, we've won.

01:10:07.230 --> 01:10:10.070
We've won, Max.

01:10:12.870 --> 01:10:13.950
Not finished!

01:10:13.950 --> 01:10:15.830
Nothing finished!

01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:18.790
Angie trusted me.

01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:22.630
He was old and tired.
He was scared.

01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:26.470
The whole thing's gotten so big.

01:10:30.270 --> 01:10:33.950
There's another cyborg
runnin' the real deal.

01:10:37.830 --> 01:10:40.670
Angie didn't know who,

01:10:40.670 --> 01:10:43.670
or how big the operation really is.

01:10:43.710 --> 01:10:46.430
He'd think he needs someone
like you to take them out, huh?

01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:47.470
And you don't?

01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:53.150
You killed my sister,

01:10:53.150 --> 01:10:55.030
motherfucker!

01:10:57.910 --> 01:11:00.070
If you want to kill me,
just do it.

01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:02.950
You need me, Max.

01:11:16.190 --> 01:11:19.030
I have to meet Yoshiro
at the volcano now.

01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:28.870
Let's go and visit the volcano now.

01:11:28.870 --> 01:11:30.630
Come on!
Come on, Max, let's go!

01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:37.430
The fucking humans.

01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:50.830
Fuck!

01:12:09.150 --> 01:12:10.790
Give me your hand.

01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:33.910
Argh!

01:14:19.470 --> 01:14:21.350
What's going on, brother?

01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:24.230
Nothing, Max, nothing.

01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:46.150
Come on, let's go.

01:14:58.670 --> 01:14:59.790
I picked up their trail,
commissioner.

01:14:59.830 --> 01:15:01.590
Subgroups three and four

01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:03.510
engage primary target on
east/west coordinates.

01:15:03.550 --> 01:15:05.430
They've got to be around here
somewhere. In pursuit.

01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:12.310
Commissioner,

01:15:12.350 --> 01:15:15.190
team eight has lock on
primary target.

01:15:15.230 --> 01:15:18.070
I think I've got him.
It won't be long now.

01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:26.550
Oof!

01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:33.190
Team eight, report!

01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:24.190
Aaah!

01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:42.310
My, we've got a lot of energy
today, don't we, Alex?

01:16:42.350 --> 01:16:45.070
What happened to our
speed-loading junkie?

01:16:47.070 --> 01:16:48.150
We're not the bad guys, Alex.

01:16:48.990 --> 01:16:50.070
We just want what's right.

01:16:50.910 --> 01:16:52.950
The humans treat us like things.

01:16:52.990 --> 01:16:54.910
They fail to understand
that we think,

01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:56.710
feel, care...

01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:59.590
It's not our fault we're alive.

01:16:59.590 --> 01:17:02.470
I don't understand why
you would help them.

01:17:02.470 --> 01:17:04.510
In time, the humans will
destroy themselves,

01:17:05.230 --> 01:17:06.470
and this precious earth.

01:17:07.150 --> 01:17:09.070
They have no appreciation
of what we have.

01:17:09.230 --> 01:17:11.950
You're really more like us, Alex.

01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:14.830
More machine than human.

01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:16.750
Join us.

01:17:18.750 --> 01:17:19.830
Never.

01:17:30.310 --> 01:17:32.230
Come on.

01:17:53.230 --> 01:17:56.070
State of the fucking art, Alex!

01:18:50.910 --> 01:18:52.750
The weapon!

01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:47.910
Get in, Max!
Come on!

01:20:52.670 --> 01:20:54.550
Cargo bay!

01:22:01.830 --> 01:22:04.590
What was that?

01:22:04.630 --> 01:22:06.470
l... I don't know!

01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:15.150
State of the art, Alex!

01:22:26.670 --> 01:22:28.430
Give it up, Alex.

01:22:41.870 --> 01:22:43.070
You're not human.
You're one of us.

01:22:45.870 --> 01:22:48.550
- Give me Jared.
- Fuck you!

01:22:54.510 --> 01:22:57.230
Alex, you can't win!

01:22:57.270 --> 01:22:59.350
Jared belongs to us.

01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:01.310
Hold on, Max!

01:23:03.110 --> 01:23:04.910
You belong to us.

01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:10.710
We own you.

01:23:10.790 --> 01:23:11.830
We paid for every part of you.

01:23:12.670 --> 01:23:14.750
Then take it!
It's yours anyway!

01:23:21.190 --> 01:23:22.190
No-oo!

01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:44.390
All right, this shouldn't
take long.

01:23:47.150 --> 01:23:48.230
Okay...

01:23:49.070 --> 01:23:50.950
Here we go.

01:23:50.990 --> 01:23:52.990
Alex, are you there?

01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:55.910
I'm right here, Jared.

01:23:56.710 --> 01:23:57.790
So...

01:23:58.630 --> 01:23:59.710
you pulled it off.

01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:03.550
Even got rid of the
bomb in my heart.

01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:06.350
Excuse me? We don't have
much time for the download.

01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:09.350
When I'm downloaded,

01:24:09.390 --> 01:24:12.110
I'll lose my memory,

01:24:12.150 --> 01:24:14.030
all my programming...

01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:15.150
Everything?

01:24:15.150 --> 01:24:17.030
You'll only exist as pure data.

01:24:18.950 --> 01:24:20.830
I will be dead?

01:24:20.870 --> 01:24:22.750
In a sense that's correct. But...

01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:24.670
Not like a human.

01:24:24.710 --> 01:24:27.470
- Alex?
- Yes, Jared?

01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:31.150
Before I go...

01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:34.990
Farnsworth asked me to tell you,

01:24:35.190 --> 01:24:37.910
he left a letter.
It's at your old drop.

01:24:44.870 --> 01:24:46.790
Are you crying, Alex?

01:24:50.630 --> 01:24:52.550
You see?

01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:55.270
You can care.

01:25:00.150 --> 01:25:02.030
Goodbye, Alex.

01:25:03.990 --> 01:25:05.910
Get me the hell out of here.

01:25:11.670 --> 01:25:13.510
It is over for me,

01:25:13.510 --> 01:25:18.230
but the struggle goes on to
preserve the human impulse.

01:25:18.230 --> 01:25:20.230
Alex knows what has to be done.

01:25:20.270 --> 01:25:22.270
And he's the one to do it.

01:25:23.070 --> 01:25:24.110
I did my part.

01:25:24.150 --> 01:25:26.030
He is back.

01:25:26.030 --> 01:25:29.710
Now, there is hope.

01:25:37.630 --> 01:25:40.350
Having a bad day, Germaine?

01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:52.670
It's not over, Alex.

01:25:52.710 --> 01:25:54.670
There are many more of us.

01:25:54.670 --> 01:25:55.830
More than you can terminate.

01:25:56.670 --> 01:25:59.550
But I've been doing a pretty
damn good job of it.

01:25:59.590 --> 01:26:02.310
Haven't I, Germaine?

01:26:02.310 --> 01:26:03.430
I don't believe this.

01:26:03.470 --> 01:26:05.350
Amazing what a tech retard can do,

01:26:06.230 --> 01:26:08.270
when he really puts
his mind to it.

01:26:09.110 --> 01:26:10.030
And that's what I've done.

01:26:10.230 --> 01:26:12.950
- I put my mind to it.
- Let me go...

01:26:12.990 --> 01:26:17.790
And I'll tell you what you need
to knoW to find two more.

01:26:17.830 --> 01:26:21.510
I don't think you have
anything I want to know.

01:26:21.670 --> 01:26:23.550
Alex, please.

01:26:23.590 --> 01:26:26.470
You know, you were right
about my dirty deals.

01:26:28.230 --> 01:26:31.070
Wh-what deals?

01:26:31.110 --> 01:26:32.230
People die, Germaine.

01:26:40.670 --> 01:26:42.550
You see, Germaine,

01:26:42.630 --> 01:26:45.590
When I pull it, I use it.

01:26:54.110 --> 01:26:55.990
"Alex,

01:26:56.030 --> 01:26:58.870
by the time you read this,
most likely I will be dead.

01:26:59.030 --> 01:27:00.790
If you are reading this,

01:27:00.790 --> 01:27:02.790
You know about the
cyborg conspiracy

01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:04.750
that has somehow
grown up around us.

01:27:05.590 --> 01:27:08.590
Jared and I have worked it out
to stop what we know of it.

01:27:08.590 --> 01:27:10.470
But to really end
this terrible thing,

01:27:11.350 --> 01:27:13.430
you need someone quite remarkable.

01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:15.310
It needs you, Alex.

01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:18.990
I haven't been kind in
my handling of you,

01:27:19.070 --> 01:27:20.150
but it's not a kind world, is it?

01:27:20.990 --> 01:27:24.790
Some of us just aren't
meant to lead happy lives."

01:27:30.550 --> 01:27:32.430
Ready, Alex-san?

01:27:43.110 --> 01:27:46.910
Yeah, I'm ready now, Max.

01:27:46.950 --> 01:27:48.990
So, where are we gonna start, eh?

01:27:49.710 --> 01:27:50.950
At the beginning.

01:27:52.710 --> 01:27:54.750
Well, then that means
we're going to New York.

01:27:56.550 --> 01:27:58.430
Tell me something, Alex-san...

01:27:58.470 --> 01:27:59.550
How are we going to get you through

01:27:59.590 --> 01:28:02.190
the airport metal detectors?
