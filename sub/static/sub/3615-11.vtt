WEBVTT

00:03.999 --> 00:06.818
One teaspoon
baking powder...

00:06.918 --> 00:08.609
One teaspoon bat guano.

00:08.709 --> 00:10.818
Ooh-hoo, it's starting
to bubble.

00:10.918 --> 00:11.162
And stink.

00:11.172 --> 00:13.567
Couldn't you have made
that potion after breakfast?

00:13.667 --> 00:15.484
No, I'm sorry, but
Phoebe has a meeting

00:15.584 --> 00:16.412
with that DA investigator

00:16.422 --> 00:18.776
and I didn't want her
to go there unarmed.

00:18.876 --> 00:20.125
LEO:
Morning.

00:21.167 --> 00:22.776
Whoa, what is that smell?

00:22.876 --> 00:24.900
That would be
the lovely smell

00:25.000 --> 00:27.292
of Piper's breakfast.

00:27.999 --> 00:28.899
Hope you're hungry.

00:28.999 --> 00:29.454
Uh, starving.

00:29.464 --> 00:31.899
Probably because you missed
dinner last night.

00:31.999 --> 00:35.150
Piper, I already said I was
sorry I was late, okay?

00:35.250 --> 00:37.776
It's not like I was out
carousing with the boys.

00:37.876 --> 00:39.900
I was out being a force of good
in the universe.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.983
A true force of good would have
called, or at least orbed.

00:43.083 --> 00:46.899
I couldn't,
not under the circumstances.

00:46.999 --> 00:48.317
Which were?

00:48.417 --> 00:48.899
Work related,

00:48.999 --> 00:51.109
which means
I can't talk about it.

00:51.209 --> 00:52.109
I mean, anything
that happens

00:52.209 --> 00:52.983
between me and a charge

00:53.083 --> 00:53.942
is confidential,
you know that.

00:54.042 --> 00:56.651
It doesn't mean
I have to like it. Ow!

00:56.751 --> 00:58.125
Oh, let me see that.

01:00.999 --> 01:03.734
You know, this
all-for-the-good-

01:03.834 --> 01:04.900
of-mankind stuff really puts me

01:05.000 --> 01:06.317
in an awful position.

01:06.417 --> 01:07.899
I have no choice
but to be understanding.

01:07.999 --> 01:10.192
You just have to accept that
you're engaged to somebody

01:10.292 --> 01:11.776
who works for the CIA.

01:11.876 --> 01:12.567
Oh.

01:12.667 --> 01:13.899
Wait, you work for the CIA?

01:13.999 --> 01:16.899
You know, ever since
you became a blonde...

01:16.999 --> 01:17.567
Hmm!

01:17.667 --> 01:18.329
Do you want something

01:18.339 --> 01:19.734
to eat before your
meeting with Reese?

01:19.834 --> 01:20.567
Not hungry, too nervous.

01:20.667 --> 01:24.442
All right, well, this will help
you with your nerves.

01:24.542 --> 01:26.025
Just a drop
in Reese's coffee

01:26.125 --> 01:27.609
and it will
out any demon.

01:27.709 --> 01:29.818
Reaction will cause
his throat to constrict.

01:29.918 --> 01:32.150
As he's choking, you run,
got it?

01:32.250 --> 01:32.899
Thanks.

01:32.999 --> 01:35.776
I hadn't even considered
that Reese might be evil.

01:35.876 --> 01:36.651
Then why are you so nervous?

01:36.751 --> 01:41.275
Because he's probing
Cole's disappearance.

01:41.375 --> 01:43.442
I mean, I'm not exactly
looking forward

01:43.542 --> 01:45.899
to being grilled about
my demon ex, you know.

01:45.999 --> 01:48.899
Well, as long as you don't
blurt out "I killed Cole,"

01:48.999 --> 01:50.275
you'll be fine.

01:50.375 --> 01:51.899
LEO:
Why don't you practice

01:51.999 --> 01:54.150
saying "as far as I know,
Cole is alive and well

01:54.250 --> 01:57.626
and could be anywhere,"
see how it feels?

02:00.999 --> 02:02.025
Okay.

02:02.125 --> 02:03.818
Uh, as far as I know,

02:03.918 --> 02:07.776
Cole is alive and well
and could be anywhere.

02:07.876 --> 02:09.150
Very believable.

02:09.250 --> 02:10.776
PRUE:
Yeah, try not to look
as guilty

02:10.876 --> 02:13.899
as you did just now.
You'll give yourself away.

02:13.999 --> 02:14.317
(<i>sighs</i>)

02:14.417 --> 02:17.067
I just can't wait for this
investigation to be over.

02:17.167 --> 02:18.025
It will soon.

02:18.125 --> 02:19.567
It has to--
there's nothing

02:19.667 --> 02:20.983
to find.

02:21.083 --> 02:22.876
Is there?

02:24.083 --> 02:25.709
Of course not.

02:28.250 --> 02:30.999
Be careful.

02:36.999 --> 02:39.375
(<i>panting</i>)

02:45.959 --> 02:46.899
You can't hurt me.

02:46.999 --> 02:48.899
I can deflect your power.

02:48.999 --> 02:51.459
All of them?

02:53.292 --> 02:54.859
(<i>grunts</i>)

02:54.959 --> 02:57.042
(<i>screams</i>)

02:59.918 --> 03:00.776
Thank God!

03:00.876 --> 03:03.401
(<i>footsteps approaching</i>)

03:03.501 --> 03:04.734
(<i>gasping</i>)

03:04.834 --> 03:06.275
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

03:06.375 --> 03:09.109
You know, the ability
to clone myself

03:09.209 --> 03:11.025
is just one of the powers

03:11.125 --> 03:11.942
that I've collected

03:12.042 --> 03:14.692
over my years
of killing witches.

03:14.792 --> 03:17.083
(<i>weeping</i>)

03:19.999 --> 03:21.192
And now...

03:21.292 --> 03:23.899
I'm about to add one more.

03:23.999 --> 03:25.109
(<i>grunts</i>)
(<i>soft thud</i>)

03:25.209 --> 03:28.876
(<i>whimpering</i>)

03:40.125 --> 03:42.234
You're too late,
whitelighter.

03:42.334 --> 03:44.250
Your charge is dead.

03:45.999 --> 03:48.501
I'll see you later.

04:42.999 --> 04:46.275
So I've got lunch
with this guy from <i>The Chronicle</i>

04:46.375 --> 04:48.567
who wants to do a story
on the club.

04:48.667 --> 04:49.983
And then I've got a meeting

04:50.083 --> 04:51.899
with these dot com start-up guys

04:51.999 --> 04:53.900
that want to do, like,
an internet thingy.

04:54.000 --> 04:54.983
What are you doing today?

04:55.083 --> 04:58.109
Mm, you know,
just the usual.

04:58.209 --> 04:59.899
Care to elaborate?

04:59.999 --> 05:01.401
Piper...

05:01.501 --> 05:02.401
Oh, come on.

05:02.501 --> 05:03.401
Just a few details,

05:03.501 --> 05:05.899
a tidbit.
It's against the rules.

05:05.999 --> 05:06.899
Rules, yes.

05:06.999 --> 05:08.359
See, this is my problem.

05:08.459 --> 05:09.776
Every time I turn around,

05:09.876 --> 05:10.692
we seem to be violating

05:10.792 --> 05:13.859
some stupid
whitelighter ordinance.

05:13.959 --> 05:14.776
We just have to be careful

05:14.876 --> 05:16.859
a-as long as we're
under probation.

05:16.959 --> 05:18.859
Which is never-ending.

05:18.959 --> 05:19.442
I don't know, Leo.

05:19.542 --> 05:21.859
I don't think they're ever
gonna let us get married.

05:21.959 --> 05:23.401
(<i>sighs</i>)
They will.

05:23.501 --> 05:25.250
They have to.

05:26.250 --> 05:28.317
Nothing is gonna keep us apart,

05:28.417 --> 05:29.192
I promise.

05:29.292 --> 05:31.067
(<i>screams</i>)
Natalie!

05:31.167 --> 05:32.899
Leo, sorry to interrupt,

05:32.999 --> 05:33.442
but we've got

05:33.542 --> 05:34.899
a major problem on our hands.

05:34.999 --> 05:36.275
Hey, I heard something.

05:36.375 --> 05:36.818
Ooh!

05:36.918 --> 05:37.526
(<i>yelling</i>)

05:37.626 --> 05:38.234
No, no! It's okay,

05:38.334 --> 05:39.651
she's a whitelighter.

05:39.751 --> 05:40.692
Natalie and I

05:40.792 --> 05:41.401
go way back.

05:41.501 --> 05:42.359
We were rookies together.

05:42.459 --> 05:43.442
Actually we, uh,
fought together

05:43.542 --> 05:45.692
in World War II.
All your charges
need to know

05:45.792 --> 05:46.899
is I'm a whitelighter.

05:46.999 --> 05:48.526
This is not a social call.

05:48.626 --> 05:49.275
I've come to warn

05:49.375 --> 05:51.859
the Charmed Ones that
a warlock just killed

05:51.959 --> 05:53.359
my most powerful charge

05:53.459 --> 05:54.776
with his athame.

05:54.876 --> 05:56.025
I'm so sorry.

05:56.125 --> 05:56.651
Thank you.

05:56.751 --> 05:58.776
The real tragedy is that it
didn't have to happen.

05:58.876 --> 06:01.192
I warned her to lay low,
and she didn't listen.

06:01.292 --> 06:03.275
She always refused
to let her magic

06:03.375 --> 06:05.125
interfere with her life.

06:05.709 --> 06:06.983
And now a warlock
has her power

06:07.083 --> 06:08.776
of deflection.
Deflection?

06:08.876 --> 06:09.899
Wait a minute,
does that mean

06:09.999 --> 06:10.899
he could deflect
our powers?

06:10.999 --> 06:12.899
Yes, which is why
all whitelighters

06:12.999 --> 06:14.234
have been put on alert.

06:14.334 --> 06:14.899
We have?

06:14.999 --> 06:15.899
Why didn't I
hear about this?

06:15.999 --> 06:18.484
Because you missed this
morning's staff meeting.

06:18.584 --> 06:19.359
(<i>chuckles</i>)

06:19.459 --> 06:20.526
You have staff meetings?

06:20.626 --> 06:23.067
With mandatory attendance.
Unless a charge

06:23.167 --> 06:26.584
is in need, which Piper was.

06:26.999 --> 06:28.442
I had to heal her.

06:28.542 --> 06:30.292
Right!

06:31.626 --> 06:33.942
I'll assume
a demon attacked your finger,

06:34.042 --> 06:35.025
since healing is restricted

06:35.125 --> 06:37.359
to such circumstances.
(<i>Leo sighs</i>)

06:37.459 --> 06:38.109
LEO:
I believe

06:38.209 --> 06:40.999
the Charmed Ones
deserve special attention.

06:41.459 --> 06:41.994
I've heard rumors

06:42.004 --> 06:45.734
about such "special attention,"
and, honestly Leo...

06:45.834 --> 06:47.692
(<i>rapidly clicking tongue</i>)

06:47.792 --> 06:49.899
(<i>clicking tongue</i>)

06:49.999 --> 06:52.317
(<i>clicking</i>)

06:52.417 --> 06:54.609
(<i>clicking</i>)

06:54.709 --> 06:56.792
Uh, whitelighter-ese?

06:57.709 --> 06:59.109
...Piper.
(<i>continues clicking</i>)

06:59.209 --> 07:01.275
Well, I guess we know
what they're talking about.

07:01.375 --> 07:03.025
(<i>clicking continues</i>)

07:03.125 --> 07:03.899
All right,
you guys can...

07:03.999 --> 07:05.484
(<i>clicks twice</i>)
...chitchat all you want.

07:05.584 --> 07:07.899
Me, I'm gonna go
look in <i>The Book
 of Shadows,</i>'kay?

07:07.999 --> 07:08.859
NATALIE:
I'll go with you.

07:08.959 --> 07:09.818
I got a look at that warlock.

07:09.918 --> 07:11.526
I might be able
to identify him.

07:11.626 --> 07:13.899
All right, well,
it's up in the attic.

07:13.999 --> 07:14.567
Attic?

07:14.667 --> 07:17.501
You mean the altar
room, don't you?

07:18.042 --> 07:19.442
The rules are very clear.

07:19.542 --> 07:20.234
Every witch must keep

07:20.334 --> 07:22.401
their <i>Book of Shadows</i>
in a sacred

07:22.501 --> 07:23.859
and protected spot.

07:23.959 --> 07:24.900
Right, of course.

07:25.000 --> 07:25.734
(<i>scoffs</i>)

07:25.834 --> 07:28.899
Maybe you can
bring the book down here.

07:28.999 --> 07:29.734
Yeah.

07:29.834 --> 07:32.776
Yeah, I'll just run up
to the "altar room,"

07:32.876 --> 07:34.899
which, by the way, is right next
to the potions lab,

07:34.999 --> 07:36.834
and I'll be right back.

07:39.876 --> 07:41.999
(<i>sighs</i>)

07:42.918 --> 07:45.167
(<i>clicking tongue</i>)

07:48.876 --> 07:52.501
Not supposed
to eat on the job.

07:56.375 --> 07:58.526
You sure you don't
want something to eat?

07:58.626 --> 07:59.999
No, I'm fine.

08:00.999 --> 08:01.692
Uh, actually,

08:01.792 --> 08:02.900
I would like
a bagel, also.

08:03.000 --> 08:03.899
Oh.
Thanks.

08:03.999 --> 08:05.109
Excuse me, miss?
Yes?

08:05.209 --> 08:06.025
Miss, can we, uh,

08:06.125 --> 08:07.899
can we have another bagel?

08:07.999 --> 08:09.959
Sure.

08:10.542 --> 08:12.484
It's a nice place.

08:12.584 --> 08:13.567
It's crowded.

08:13.667 --> 08:15.899
I guess that's
why you picked it.

08:15.999 --> 08:17.442
It makes me think
that you're

08:17.542 --> 08:18.899
afraid of something.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.899
(<i>chuckles</i>)

08:20.999 --> 08:22.109
Hmm?

08:22.209 --> 08:24.375
(<i>choking</i>)

08:25.959 --> 08:27.359
(<i>chokes</i>)

08:27.459 --> 08:28.359
(<i>coughs</i>)

08:28.459 --> 08:30.484
Oh... allergies.

08:30.584 --> 08:31.900
So? So are you?

08:32.000 --> 08:33.400
Am I what?

08:33.501 --> 08:33.942
Afraid.

08:34.042 --> 08:36.484
Afraid of Cole?

08:36.583 --> 08:37.859
No.

08:37.958 --> 08:38.818
Why should I be?

08:38.918 --> 08:39.899
Well, several reasons.

08:39.999 --> 08:41.899
Not the least of which
is he's a fraud.

08:41.999 --> 08:43.192
Or a man who exists
only on paper.

08:43.292 --> 08:45.442
Wormed his way
into the D.A.'s office

08:45.542 --> 08:46.192
for reasons unknown,

08:46.292 --> 08:50.025
who apparently
has a very dark side.

08:50.125 --> 08:53.334
We found blood stains
in his carpet.

08:53.834 --> 08:58.109
And a hidden cabinet
full of occult paraphernalia.

08:58.209 --> 09:01.192
Are you telling me you don't
know anything about this?

09:01.292 --> 09:02.067
No.

09:02.167 --> 09:04.692
I-I mean... yes,

09:04.792 --> 09:05.609
I don't know

09:05.709 --> 09:06.859
about any of this.

09:06.959 --> 09:08.899
Look, Miss Halliwell,

09:08.999 --> 09:09.526
I think

09:09.626 --> 09:11.899
you know more
than you're letting on.

09:11.999 --> 09:12.496
But you're scared.

09:12.506 --> 09:14.567
You're afraid
that if I find out the truth,

09:14.667 --> 09:15.983
you're gonna get in trouble.

09:16.083 --> 09:17.359
Am I right?

09:17.459 --> 09:19.234
I wish I could help you.

09:19.334 --> 09:21.942
But I can't.

09:22.042 --> 09:24.275
I'm sorry,
I really am.
Uh...

09:24.375 --> 09:25.859
listen, Cole's the kind of man

09:25.959 --> 09:27.899
who knows how
to cover his tracks, okay?

09:27.999 --> 09:30.609
Now, if he's alive
and you know something,

09:30.709 --> 09:31.899
he could hurt you.

09:31.999 --> 09:33.109
He could

09:33.209 --> 09:34.876
hurt your sisters, too.

09:39.501 --> 09:41.899
"The power of deflection
is a witch's best shield

09:41.999 --> 09:43.109
against the forces of darkness."

09:43.209 --> 09:45.859
Unless the forces of
darkness already have it,

09:45.959 --> 09:48.484
in which case it's the
great shield against us.

09:48.584 --> 09:50.526
All right,
how did he get close enough

09:50.626 --> 09:52.526
to get it
from such a powerful witch?

09:52.626 --> 09:54.359
PIPER:
Maybe he wasn't
working alone.

09:54.459 --> 09:56.150
LEO:
Or maybe he possesses

09:56.250 --> 09:56.899
the power...
Cloning.

09:56.999 --> 09:58.692
I was just thinking
the same thing.

09:58.792 --> 09:59.442
LEO:
The ability

09:59.542 --> 10:01.192
to duplicate oneself, but...

10:01.292 --> 10:02.275
NATALIE:
It can't be sustained

10:02.375 --> 10:03.818
for long periods of time.

10:03.918 --> 10:04.496
PIPER:
That's cute,

10:04.506 --> 10:07.983
how you guys finish
each other's sentences.

10:08.083 --> 10:09.692
NATALIE:
Happens when you work

10:09.792 --> 10:11.983
with someone
for as long as we have.

10:12.083 --> 10:12.899
I see that.

10:12.999 --> 10:14.899
LEO:
Maybe we should
check the book--

10:14.999 --> 10:15.859
see if the warlock

10:15.959 --> 10:17.899
stole the cloning power,
too, okay?

10:17.999 --> 10:18.651
PRUE:
All right.

10:18.751 --> 10:20.999
Cross-reference cloning
with warlocks.

10:25.542 --> 10:26.359
Here it is.

10:26.459 --> 10:27.567
A warlock named Aames.

10:27.667 --> 10:29.526
It seems that, uh,
ten years ago,

10:29.626 --> 10:31.109
he murdered a witch in Glasgow

10:31.209 --> 10:32.899
and stole her
power of cloning.

10:32.999 --> 10:34.359
Do you recognize him?

10:34.459 --> 10:34.900
That's him.

10:35.000 --> 10:35.734
PRUE:
Oh, well,

10:35.834 --> 10:38.275
cloning and deflection
are not his only tricks.

10:38.375 --> 10:39.401
It says here

10:39.501 --> 10:41.609
that Aames also
killed a witch

10:41.709 --> 10:43.609
in Kenya in '89
and took the power

10:43.709 --> 10:46.899
of transmo-gri-fi-ca-tion.

10:46.999 --> 10:47.734
Trans-what?

10:47.834 --> 10:50.667
BOTH:
The ability
to change shape or form.

10:52.375 --> 10:53.442
(<i>chuckles</i>):
Okay.

10:53.542 --> 10:55.899
So, uh, what's his master plan?

10:55.999 --> 10:57.109
What makes you think he has one?

10:57.209 --> 10:58.526
Well, the time and geography
between kills

10:58.626 --> 11:01.776
suggests that he was hunting
these particular witches, right?

11:01.876 --> 11:02.899
It's not sport,

11:02.999 --> 11:03.651
it's strategy.

11:03.751 --> 11:05.067
So all we have to do
to catch him

11:05.167 --> 11:06.609
is figure out what that plan is

11:06.709 --> 11:07.983
and then beat him to the punch.

11:08.083 --> 11:08.899
PRUE:
Right, or we can try

11:08.999 --> 11:10.899
and take him out first
before he even has a chance.

11:10.999 --> 11:14.192
Leo, we should discuss
the best way to approach

11:14.292 --> 11:16.000
this situation.

11:16.999 --> 11:17.859
I mean in private.

11:17.959 --> 11:22.000
If you wouldn't mind
going into another room, please?

11:22.709 --> 11:26.209
Or, how about this idea?

11:28.167 --> 11:28.526
Hmm!

11:28.626 --> 11:30.275
Piper, what are you doing?

11:30.375 --> 11:31.067
Getting irritated.

11:31.167 --> 11:32.899
Who put Lady
Attitude in charge?

11:32.999 --> 11:34.899
She's not in charge.
PIPER:
Really?

11:34.999 --> 11:36.234
'Cause she's
acting like it.

11:36.334 --> 11:37.078
I thought whitelighters

11:37.088 --> 11:38.609
were supposed to
guide, not dictate.

11:38.709 --> 11:41.192
(<i>sighs</i>)
She is just trying to help.

11:41.292 --> 11:42.401
By what? Slowing us down

11:42.501 --> 11:44.109
and second-guessing us?
Introducing

11:44.209 --> 11:47.317
the concept of caution
and organization into the manner

11:47.417 --> 11:48.526
isn't a bad idea.

11:48.626 --> 11:49.900
Natalie's considered

11:50.000 --> 11:51.442
one of the top whitelighters
up there.

11:51.542 --> 11:52.484
Oh, I bet they love her.

11:52.584 --> 11:54.818
PIPER:
She's never met a
rule she didn't like.

11:54.918 --> 11:56.234
Leo, we already
have a whitelighter.

11:56.334 --> 11:58.025
Besides,
I don't really like anybody

11:58.125 --> 11:59.150
who doesn't trust us.

11:59.250 --> 12:00.067
You've misread her.

12:00.167 --> 12:02.567
Natalie is cautious because
she just lost a charge,

12:02.667 --> 12:05.776
and she's worried the same
thing is gonna happen to you.

12:05.876 --> 12:08.025
You can't
question her heart.

12:08.125 --> 12:10.834
Okay, how about everything else?

12:11.375 --> 12:13.542
I'll talk to her.

12:14.999 --> 12:16.899
Now, please,
would you unfreeze her?

12:16.999 --> 12:18.999
Sure.

12:20.667 --> 12:21.776
There you go.

12:21.876 --> 12:23.899
Wait a minute.

12:23.999 --> 12:24.818
What's going on?

12:24.918 --> 12:26.942
I got to go
talk to Piper.

12:27.042 --> 12:27.899
Leo!

12:27.999 --> 12:29.484
I'll be right back.

12:29.584 --> 12:31.401
Piper froze you.

12:31.501 --> 12:33.275
Sh-She what?

12:33.375 --> 12:34.526
Yep.

12:34.626 --> 12:36.567
Hey, you want
to freeze me in bed

12:36.667 --> 12:38.401
for your own personal pleasures,
that is fine,

12:38.501 --> 12:40.899
but freezing Natalie
is not going to make her

12:40.999 --> 12:41.983
or the Elders happy.

12:42.083 --> 12:42.899
Well, I'm sorry,

12:42.999 --> 12:43.899
but how do you
think I feel

12:43.999 --> 12:46.900
listening to you
two clickety-
clack about work

12:47.000 --> 12:48.692
when you don't
tell <i>me</i> anything?

12:48.792 --> 12:52.109
I mean, she clearly
knows things about
you that I don't.

12:52.209 --> 12:54.150
She's an old friend.

12:54.250 --> 12:55.899
Well, obviously.

12:55.999 --> 12:56.609
Come on,

12:56.709 --> 12:57.900
you're not jealous, are you?

12:58.000 --> 12:59.401
Because there is nothing...

12:59.501 --> 13:00.526
Leo, I'm not jealous of <i>her.</i>

13:00.626 --> 13:01.942
I am jealous of the
part of your life

13:02.042 --> 13:04.899
she gets to share
with you that I
don't, you know?

13:04.999 --> 13:06.359
Like where
you go all day,

13:06.459 --> 13:08.150
who your other
charges are,

13:08.250 --> 13:09.818
what it's like up There.

13:09.918 --> 13:11.150
I've taken you up There before.

13:11.250 --> 13:13.025
Once. And I don't even
get to remember it.

13:13.125 --> 13:16.651
It's just more rules, more
stupid rules that exclude me.

13:16.751 --> 13:17.526
Unlike you and Natalie,

13:17.626 --> 13:20.609
who literally speak
the same language
with each other.

13:20.709 --> 13:22.899
It is just boring shop talk.

13:22.999 --> 13:23.567
It's secrets.

13:23.667 --> 13:26.025
And if there's one
thing I've learned
as a Halliwell,

13:26.125 --> 13:28.899
you don't keep secrets
from the people you love.

13:28.999 --> 13:29.983
(<i>door opening</i>)

13:30.083 --> 13:30.900
Hi.

13:31.000 --> 13:31.942
(<i>door shuts</i>)

13:32.042 --> 13:34.734
Am I interrupting something?

13:34.834 --> 13:37.667
No.
Yes.

13:37.999 --> 13:41.899
How did your, uh, thing go
with the investigator?

13:41.999 --> 13:42.818
Oh, fine.

13:42.918 --> 13:44.526
At least he's not a demon.

13:44.626 --> 13:45.025
Uh, Leo,

13:45.125 --> 13:48.651
can I talk to you
about something? Soon?

13:48.751 --> 13:49.900
Take a number.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.067
Maybe later, okay?

13:52.167 --> 13:53.899
Why don't you go meet Natalie?

13:53.999 --> 13:54.899
Who's Natalie?

13:54.999 --> 13:57.876
She's a...
Fellow whitelighter.

13:58.167 --> 13:59.899
See? I finished your sentence.

13:59.999 --> 14:02.999
Hmm. That's not
what I was going to say.

14:09.626 --> 14:10.900
You're wasting your time.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.692
You can't scry for warlocks.

14:12.792 --> 14:14.109
I'm not;
I'm scrying for a witch.

14:14.209 --> 14:16.942
I'm focusing the crystal
on your charge's power,

14:17.042 --> 14:19.025
which technically
is still alive.

14:19.125 --> 14:21.900
Hi. You must be, uh...

14:22.000 --> 14:23.401
PRUE:
Oh.

14:23.501 --> 14:24.899
Okay. Here we go.

14:24.999 --> 14:26.275
I think I found Aames.

14:26.375 --> 14:29.983
Uh, industrial district,
south San Francisco.

14:30.083 --> 14:30.983
A warlock? What's going on?

14:31.083 --> 14:32.899
We'll fill you in on the way.
Piper! Leo!

14:32.999 --> 14:34.899
Wait, you're not going
after him, are you?

14:34.999 --> 14:37.109
Yeah, that would be the idea.

14:37.209 --> 14:39.042
You're not prepared.

14:44.334 --> 14:45.526
What did you see?

14:45.626 --> 14:46.899
A warlock, I think.

14:46.999 --> 14:48.234
Killing a male witch.

14:48.334 --> 14:49.609
Not if we can help it.

14:49.709 --> 14:50.484
It's three against one.

14:50.584 --> 14:53.899
We should be able to counter
his power of deflection.

14:53.999 --> 14:56.067
But he can also
clone himself.

14:56.167 --> 14:57.899
So, then
it's three against two.

14:57.999 --> 14:59.484
Still, the odds are on our side.

14:59.584 --> 15:02.150
Plus, we'll have
the element of surprise.

15:02.250 --> 15:03.567
People,
we're under an alert.

15:03.667 --> 15:05.899
You can't go running off
half-cocked.

15:05.999 --> 15:06.734
"People"?

15:06.834 --> 15:07.983
NATALIE:
You must consult
the Elders,

15:08.083 --> 15:10.150
find out what they know,
what they want you to do.

15:10.250 --> 15:11.526
PIPER:
And how long
will that take?

15:11.626 --> 15:14.401
Long enough to lose
another witch's life?

15:14.501 --> 15:15.899
Better one than four.

15:15.999 --> 15:16.899
You wondered

15:16.999 --> 15:17.899
what Aames' ultimate goal was.

15:17.999 --> 15:20.417
What if it's to kill
the Charmed Ones?

15:22.000 --> 15:24.275
Think of the damage he could do
with all of your powers.

15:24.375 --> 15:25.942
All right, Natalie's right.

15:26.042 --> 15:28.275
We should definitely check
with the Elders first.

15:28.375 --> 15:30.776
Do it quickly.
I'll be back

15:30.876 --> 15:32.999
as soon as possible.

15:34.459 --> 15:36.317
So, what, we're supposed
to just wait?

15:36.417 --> 15:38.900
No. I had to say something
to get rid of her.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.317
LEO:
Didn't you hear
what she said?

15:40.417 --> 15:42.899
Consulting with the Elders
is for your own protection.

15:42.999 --> 15:46.167
And siding with us is for yours.

15:50.250 --> 15:55.250
(<i>chanting</i>)

15:58.167 --> 16:01.417
(<i>tires screeching</i>)

16:09.918 --> 16:11.734
Oh, Piper, freeze him.

16:11.834 --> 16:13.999
PIPER:
He deflected it.

16:16.042 --> 16:17.899
What happened?
Where did he go?

16:17.999 --> 16:18.899
I don't think
that was Aames.

16:18.999 --> 16:19.899
I think
that was his clone.

16:19.999 --> 16:20.899
All right, well,
the real Aames

16:20.999 --> 16:21.899
must be around
here someplace.

16:21.999 --> 16:23.192
Okay, maybe we should
get out of here.

16:23.292 --> 16:25.401
No, no, no, what about the witch
in Phoebe's premonition?

16:25.501 --> 16:26.734
We can't just leave him.

16:26.834 --> 16:28.526
Afraid you were
going to say that.

16:28.626 --> 16:29.120
What did he look like?

16:29.130 --> 16:31.876
Oh, I don't know;
uh, kind of balding...

16:33.999 --> 16:35.150
Sort of like that!

16:35.250 --> 16:39.818
Who are you?
Why did you summon me?

16:39.918 --> 16:40.899
That's no witch;
that's...

16:40.999 --> 16:41.899
a darklighter.

16:41.999 --> 16:44.626
Leo, Leo, get
out of here!

16:46.334 --> 16:47.692
(<i>grunting</i>)

16:47.792 --> 16:49.734
(<i>grunting</i>)
(<i>Phoebe grunting</i>)

16:49.834 --> 16:51.692
Okay, I don't
understand.

16:51.792 --> 16:54.442
Why is there a
darklighter here?

16:54.542 --> 16:58.250
Oh, did I miss
all the fun?

17:05.709 --> 17:09.334
No, wait-- I <i>am</i> the fun.

17:13.501 --> 17:15.358
Thanks for this.

17:15.459 --> 17:17.791
(<i>growls softly</i>)

17:23.375 --> 17:25.776
LEO:
Did you get
the darklighter?

17:25.876 --> 17:27.401
No, uh, but Aames did.

17:27.501 --> 17:28.442
LEO:
Aames?

17:28.541 --> 17:29.983
A warlock killed a darklighter?

17:30.083 --> 17:30.899
And took
his crossbow.

17:30.999 --> 17:32.234
Well, that doesn't
make any sense.

17:32.334 --> 17:34.275
They both play for team evil.

17:34.375 --> 17:35.025
Yeah,
what I don't get

17:35.125 --> 17:37.818
is why Aames had no interest
in attacking us.

17:37.918 --> 17:38.942
Maybe he knew
he was outnumbered.

17:39.042 --> 17:40.899
No, he didn't really seem
overly concerned.

17:40.999 --> 17:44.626
In fact,
he seemed cocky.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.899
Good, you're still here.

17:46.999 --> 17:49.109
Speaking of cocky.

17:49.209 --> 17:49.942
I consulted
the Elders,

17:50.042 --> 17:51.484
and they want you
to hold back.

17:51.584 --> 17:52.899
They think
the witch Phoebe saw

17:52.999 --> 17:54.234
might be
a force of darkness.

17:54.334 --> 17:56.025
A darklighter,
actually.

17:56.125 --> 17:56.899
How do you know?

17:56.999 --> 18:00.442
We went, we saw, we
didn't quite conquer.

18:00.542 --> 18:01.317
You what?

18:01.417 --> 18:02.899
Leo, how could you
let this happen?

18:02.999 --> 18:04.899
This wasn't Leo's decision;
it was ours.

18:04.999 --> 18:06.442
NATALIE:
You'll take
responsibility

18:06.542 --> 18:07.942
for a decision,
but not for your lives?

18:08.042 --> 18:09.692
That warlock
could have killed you.

18:09.792 --> 18:10.859
He wasn't after us.

18:10.959 --> 18:12.317
That makes you lucky, not smart.
You were reckless.

18:12.417 --> 18:15.317
As the Charmed
Ones, you have an
obligation to serve

18:15.417 --> 18:18.692
the greater good;
you have a higher calling.

18:18.792 --> 18:19.899
So do we.

18:19.999 --> 18:21.234
I think we'd better

18:21.334 --> 18:22.899
both go up this time.

18:22.999 --> 18:25.999
Better lay low
until we get back.

18:29.999 --> 18:30.899
PIPER:
Uh...

18:30.999 --> 18:32.192
what's with the
hand-holding thing?

18:32.292 --> 18:33.526
PHOEBE:
That's the least
of our problems.

18:33.626 --> 18:36.442
We have to concentrate on
finding and vanquishing Aames.

18:36.542 --> 18:38.651
Yeah, and we can't count
on scrying to locate him

18:38.751 --> 18:40.317
'cause it just could be
his clone again.

18:40.417 --> 18:41.526
PIPER:
I still think we
need to decode

18:41.626 --> 18:45.317
his master plan, and
then that way, we
can figure him out.

18:45.417 --> 18:46.609
I'll take Book duty.

18:46.709 --> 18:49.234
I'll do a flow chart--
see where all this is leading.

18:49.334 --> 18:51.609
I'll help; anything
to get rid of her.

18:51.709 --> 18:52.609
You mean him?

18:52.709 --> 18:55.918
Nah, I mean her.

19:09.751 --> 19:12.292
What am I going to do about you?

19:24.792 --> 19:27.275
(<i>whitelighters clicking
 tongues throughout</i>)

19:27.375 --> 19:29.899
I've never seen
the Elders like
this before.

19:29.999 --> 19:32.067
They're worried about
what Aames is up to.

19:32.167 --> 19:35.025
Aren't you going to
change into your robes?

19:35.125 --> 19:36.359
The rules say...

19:36.459 --> 19:37.401
I know the rules.

19:37.501 --> 19:39.900
I find my jeans
more comfortable.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.899
That attitude
scares me, Leo.

19:42.999 --> 19:44.651
I wouldn't be a good friend

19:44.751 --> 19:47.401
if I didn't tell you
how concerned I am

19:47.501 --> 19:49.442
about the situation
at the manor.

19:49.542 --> 19:52.899
You haven't seen the
Charmed Ones at their best.

19:52.999 --> 19:55.109
Trust me, they're
talented witches.

19:55.209 --> 19:59.651
They're also sloppy,
untrained, emotional...

19:59.751 --> 20:01.109
And undisciplined--
I know.

20:01.209 --> 20:03.899
But that's part of
what makes them great.

20:03.999 --> 20:05.192
They don't work by rote.

20:05.292 --> 20:07.899
They work on instinct,

20:07.999 --> 20:08.609
on passion.

20:08.709 --> 20:10.067
I'm all for instinct
and passion.

20:10.167 --> 20:10.983
But they're too impulsive.

20:11.083 --> 20:13.484
They lead with their
hearts, not their heads.

20:13.584 --> 20:14.899
And they're not only ones.

20:14.999 --> 20:15.942
You think I do, too?

20:16.042 --> 20:19.025
I think it's clear
that you love them.

20:19.125 --> 20:21.526
Every whitelighter
loves their charges.

20:21.626 --> 20:23.192
Not the way
that you do.

20:23.292 --> 20:24.192
Your feelings are clouding

20:24.292 --> 20:25.651
your ability
to see their weaknesses.

20:25.751 --> 20:28.401
Weaknesses? I
think their record
speaks for itself.

20:28.501 --> 20:31.067
They took out Belthazor,
who took out the Triad.

20:31.167 --> 20:32.859
But Belthazor
is a perfect example.

20:32.959 --> 20:35.818
He never should have gotten
that close to them.

20:35.918 --> 20:36.942
I can't help but think

20:37.042 --> 20:38.983
that your relationship
with Piper...

20:39.083 --> 20:40.067
Is none of your business.

20:40.167 --> 20:43.109
Actually Leo,
it is my business.

20:43.209 --> 20:45.526
The Elders want to know
whether or not I think

20:45.626 --> 20:47.999
it's getting in the way
of your job.

20:49.999 --> 20:52.983
PHOEBE:
Leo? Leo?

20:53.083 --> 20:53.776
That's Phoebe.

20:53.876 --> 20:57.125
The rules say
a charge's call
takes precedent.

21:04.999 --> 21:07.125
Leo?!

21:10.626 --> 21:11.899
Sorry, Phoebe.
(<i>gasping</i>)

21:11.999 --> 21:14.317
I forgot
that you needed to talk.

21:14.417 --> 21:15.317
What's up?
Okay.

21:15.417 --> 21:16.109
Just so I'm clear,

21:16.209 --> 21:17.150
this is confidential, right?

21:17.250 --> 21:19.776
I mean, anything
that I'm about to say to you

21:19.876 --> 21:20.983
just stays between me and you.

21:21.083 --> 21:22.734
Absolutely.
And They don't get to know,

21:22.834 --> 21:25.401
and They're not eavesdropping
or anything right now?

21:25.501 --> 21:26.818
Phoebe, what is it?

21:26.918 --> 21:28.999
You need to sit.

21:33.626 --> 21:37.025
Okay. Here goes.

21:37.125 --> 21:40.818
Leo...

21:40.918 --> 21:43.359
Cole is alive.

21:43.459 --> 21:45.609
What?

21:45.709 --> 21:48.651
Cole. Belthazor.

21:48.751 --> 21:50.567
I didn't really vanquish him.

21:50.667 --> 21:52.401
I know.

21:52.501 --> 21:53.401
I know it's horrible.

21:53.501 --> 21:54.245
And I've barely been able
to live

21:54.255 --> 21:57.025
with Prue and Piper ever since,
but I-I just couldn't tell them.

21:57.125 --> 21:59.192
Phoebe...
I couldn't kill him, Leo.

21:59.292 --> 22:01.609
I had every intention
of doing it, but when

22:01.709 --> 22:04.025
I got there and I was
face to face with him,

22:04.125 --> 22:05.234
I-I just, I couldn't kill him.

22:05.334 --> 22:07.818
And I knew that my sisters
were going to.

22:07.918 --> 22:09.317
So, you faked his death?

22:09.417 --> 22:10.734
I didn't have a choice.

22:10.834 --> 22:11.859
Leo, I knew in my heart

22:11.959 --> 22:14.025
that he would never
try and hurt us.

22:14.125 --> 22:16.067
Otherwise,
I wouldn't

22:16.167 --> 22:17.567
have let him go.

22:17.667 --> 22:18.899
You have to believe me.

22:18.999 --> 22:21.192
All I knew is that...

22:21.292 --> 22:24.401
I loved Cole.

22:24.501 --> 22:26.609
And if anyone understands
forbidden love,

22:26.709 --> 22:27.526
it's you, isn't it?

22:27.626 --> 22:28.983
Oh, my God, Phoebe,
it's not even close

22:29.083 --> 22:30.025
to being the same thing.

22:30.125 --> 22:32.526
He is a demon.
He's half human.

22:32.626 --> 22:34.484
For God's sakes, he's a killer!

22:34.584 --> 22:35.287
He has killed
witches

22:35.297 --> 22:38.401
and innocents, and anything else
that has gotten in his way.

22:38.501 --> 22:39.983
What is the matter
with you?!

22:40.083 --> 22:40.859
What makes you think

22:40.959 --> 22:42.899
that he is not going
to come back here right now

22:42.999 --> 22:44.651
and try and kill
all three of you?

22:44.751 --> 22:46.692
He won't. I know he's good.

22:46.792 --> 22:47.899
No, you hope that he's good.

22:47.999 --> 22:49.876
You <i>want</i> him to be good.

22:50.417 --> 22:53.250
Why did you even tell me this?

22:54.709 --> 22:55.162
I don't know, Leo.

22:55.172 --> 22:59.150
I was sort of counting on you
for your guidance and support.

22:59.250 --> 23:02.192
Well, it's my guidance
and support

23:02.292 --> 23:04.109
that got you into this mess.

23:04.209 --> 23:08.000
Yeah, I-I don't even know
how to begin to fix this.

23:17.125 --> 23:19.999
(<i>groaning</i>)

23:21.918 --> 23:25.109
Leo? Leo, what's
the matter?

23:25.209 --> 23:25.899
I don't know!

23:25.999 --> 23:27.442
Feels like a witch
is being hurt!

23:27.542 --> 23:28.192
I can feel her pain.

23:28.292 --> 23:29.526
PHOEBE:
Is it one
of your charges?

23:29.626 --> 23:31.484
LEO:
No.
What happened?

23:31.584 --> 23:32.150
(<i>screams</i>)

23:32.250 --> 23:35.776
(<i>screams</i>)

23:35.876 --> 23:37.899
She needs help!

23:37.999 --> 23:40.234
Of course, I could
have killed you.

23:40.334 --> 23:42.818
But it's not your
powers I'm after.

23:42.918 --> 23:45.317
I've set my sights
a little higher.

23:45.417 --> 23:46.025
(<i>moaning cry</i>)

23:46.125 --> 23:50.899
I'm looking for a
few good whitelighters.

23:50.999 --> 23:53.067
(<i>chuckling</i>)

23:53.167 --> 23:56.609
Well, actually, just one.

23:56.709 --> 23:58.776
That's all I'm missing now.

23:58.876 --> 23:59.983
(<i>whimpers softly</i>)

24:00.083 --> 24:04.292
And yours will do just fine.

24:04.751 --> 24:06.567
PIPER:
Why isn't her whitelighter
 helping her?

24:06.667 --> 24:10.359
I don't know,
but I have to go to her.

24:10.459 --> 24:11.899
No, Leo, wait.

24:11.999 --> 24:14.484
I just realized-- how
could we have missed it?

24:14.584 --> 24:15.484
The only reason

24:15.584 --> 24:16.899
Aames would have
killed a darklighter

24:16.999 --> 24:20.317
is so that he could
use the crossbow to
kill a whitelighter.

24:20.417 --> 24:22.900
She's right Leo, it's a trap.

24:23.000 --> 24:23.899
LEO:
I don't understand.

24:23.999 --> 24:25.526
Why would he even want
to kill a whitelighter?

24:25.626 --> 24:28.234
To gain the power to orb
up There-- the only way in.

24:28.334 --> 24:30.899
Once there, he'd be able
to decimate all whitelighters.

24:30.999 --> 24:33.526
And that would
leave all their
charges unprotected.

24:33.626 --> 24:35.484
He would be able
to wipe out

24:35.584 --> 24:38.526
all witches everywhere,
including us.

24:38.626 --> 24:41.109
Sounds like a
master plan to me.

24:41.209 --> 24:42.942
NATALIE:
The Elders have
instituted a lockdown,

24:43.042 --> 24:45.275
and recalled all whitelighters
from Earth.

24:45.375 --> 24:46.359
Leo and I are the only ones

24:46.459 --> 24:48.109
who have retained
the power to orb,

24:48.209 --> 24:49.609
so we can help you stop Aames.

24:49.709 --> 24:51.067
LEO:
Must be why
I feel her pain.

24:51.167 --> 24:54.025
Oh, if you
could only feel it.

24:54.125 --> 24:55.025
I feel it.

24:55.125 --> 24:56.899
But I won't be ruled by it.

24:56.999 --> 25:00.709
A whitelighter who's controlled
by his emotions is useless.

25:01.167 --> 25:04.234
The greater good
must come first.

25:04.334 --> 25:07.125
(<i>quivering whimper</i>)

25:11.209 --> 25:13.275
Well, this is boring.

25:13.375 --> 25:18.317
What kind of lame whitelighter
do you have?

25:18.417 --> 25:19.734
(<i>sighing</i>)

25:19.834 --> 25:20.899
WITCH:
They must be

25:20.999 --> 25:23.250
onto you now. Oh!

25:24.083 --> 25:25.609
I think you're right.

25:25.709 --> 25:27.484
(<i>agonized whimpering</i>)

25:27.584 --> 25:28.983
Which means what--

25:29.083 --> 25:32.818
they'll send witches
to try and stop me?

25:32.918 --> 25:38.584
Well, if witches come,
can whitelighters be far behind?

25:39.999 --> 25:40.899
(<i>chuckling</i>)

25:40.999 --> 25:43.192
After ten years
of chasing a dream,

25:43.292 --> 25:46.776
the dream starts chasing me.

25:46.876 --> 25:47.734
Ooh!

25:47.834 --> 25:48.899
Of course,
you know

25:48.999 --> 25:50.567
there is a down side.

25:50.667 --> 25:54.067
I no longer have
any use for you!

25:54.167 --> 25:55.776
(<i>witch screaming</i>)
(<i>agonized groan</i>)

25:55.876 --> 25:59.942
NATALIE:
What?! Leo, what is it?

26:00.042 --> 26:02.584
He killed her.

26:04.083 --> 26:07.000
What does your rule
book say to do now?

26:12.751 --> 26:15.150
I can't believe Natalie just
let her die like that.

26:15.250 --> 26:16.899
We should have done something.

26:16.999 --> 26:17.899
Like what?

26:17.999 --> 26:19.692
I don't know. Something.
PRUE:
Yeah, well,

26:19.792 --> 26:20.526
we need to figure out a way

26:20.626 --> 26:21.859
to stop Aames
before he kills again.

26:21.959 --> 26:23.899
We should be working
on a vanquishing spell.

26:23.999 --> 26:25.401
It's gonna be
a tricky spell, though.

26:25.501 --> 26:26.818
We have to counteract
a lot of powers.

26:26.918 --> 26:28.484
PIPER:
Plus, we need to
do it fast, 'cause

26:28.584 --> 26:30.192
I don't like my
boyfriend being one

26:30.292 --> 26:32.734
of the only two
targets on Earth.

26:32.834 --> 26:35.918
(<i>sighs</i>)

26:36.626 --> 26:38.025
PIPER:
We'd like
to speak

26:38.125 --> 26:38.900
to Leo in private,

26:39.000 --> 26:41.900
so if you wouldn't
mind going into
another room?

26:42.000 --> 26:45.526
If it's work-related,
you can discuss it with me.

26:45.626 --> 26:47.042
What do you mean?

26:48.792 --> 26:50.584
Leo?

26:53.209 --> 26:56.484
I asked Natalie to take over
as your whitelighter,

26:56.584 --> 26:58.834
and she accepted.

26:59.083 --> 27:00.776
What are you talking about?

27:00.876 --> 27:02.442
LEO:
Piper, nothing
is more important to me

27:02.542 --> 27:04.234
than your safety,
and my being here

27:04.334 --> 27:06.025
is putting all of your lives
at risk.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.484
Leo, you have done nothing
but protect us.

27:08.584 --> 27:09.942
You saw what happened upstairs.

27:10.042 --> 27:12.734
I would have rushed off
to help that witch

27:12.834 --> 27:13.859
if you hadn't stopped me.

27:13.959 --> 27:16.899
Now, I am supposed
to be guiding you, and you

27:16.999 --> 27:18.818
are guiding me.
PRUE:
Leo,

27:18.918 --> 27:19.900
we all make mistakes.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.899
We can't afford
to make them now.

27:21.999 --> 27:24.959
Leo, if this is because of me...

27:26.167 --> 27:27.876
It isn't, Phoebe.

27:28.459 --> 27:30.484
It's because of me.

27:30.584 --> 27:32.275
And maybe Natalie's right.

27:32.375 --> 27:35.275
Maybe my feelings
for you are clouding my ability

27:35.375 --> 27:36.899
to guide you, I don't know.

27:36.999 --> 27:38.609
But all I do know is
that this is no time

27:38.709 --> 27:41.876
for self-doubt,
not with Aames out there.

27:42.918 --> 27:44.401
(<i>sighs</i>)

27:44.501 --> 27:45.859
Piper...

27:45.959 --> 27:49.192
they want me to join
in the lockdown.

27:49.292 --> 27:52.900
Until I return, I want you
to do as Natalie asks.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.317
It's important for us.

27:54.417 --> 27:56.999
(<i>sighs</i>)

28:07.999 --> 28:09.734
I suggest you channel your anger

28:09.834 --> 28:12.999
toward the warlock
you're meant to vanquish.

28:13.542 --> 28:14.317
Now, first...

28:14.417 --> 28:15.526
PRUE:
Okay, can
we just have

28:15.626 --> 28:16.942
a moment to process this,
please?

28:17.042 --> 28:19.899
No, it's time you stopped
focusing on yourselves

28:19.999 --> 28:21.609
and started focusing on Aames.

28:21.709 --> 28:22.818
You must prepare yourselves

28:22.918 --> 28:24.899
for battle, mentally,
physically,

28:24.999 --> 28:26.067
sartorially.

28:26.167 --> 28:26.900
(<i>laughs</i>)

28:27.000 --> 28:27.899
I'm sorry. What?

28:27.999 --> 28:28.942
She doesn't
like our clothes.

28:29.042 --> 28:29.983
NATALIE:
You need outfits

28:30.083 --> 28:31.275
that are loose and move.

28:31.375 --> 28:32.192
That means no more

28:32.292 --> 28:34.792
bra-less, strapless...

28:35.542 --> 28:36.442
fearless

28:36.542 --> 28:38.275
attire.

28:38.375 --> 28:41.542
Okay, but then,
I have nothing to wear.

28:53.709 --> 28:55.899
PRUE:
Oh...

28:55.999 --> 28:57.401
Oh...

28:57.501 --> 29:00.317
Okay, tell me again
why we're doing this.

29:00.417 --> 29:01.526
PIPER:
Because...

29:01.626 --> 29:04.442
one bad word
from General Goody Two Shoes,

29:04.542 --> 29:06.442
and I'm not getting married.

29:06.542 --> 29:07.859
That's a good reason,
I guess.

29:07.959 --> 29:08.899
NATALIE:
All right.

29:08.999 --> 29:10.150
Let's get going.

29:10.250 --> 29:14.999
Defeating Aames
will require split
second timing...

29:15.584 --> 29:17.150
and flawless teamwork.

29:17.250 --> 29:18.899
I can't tell you
what you'll be doing,

29:18.999 --> 29:20.401
but I can tell
you what you won't.

29:20.501 --> 29:23.317
You won't be
winging it.

29:23.417 --> 29:25.899
You won't be hoping
for the best.

29:25.999 --> 29:28.275
The will to win is the will
to prepare to win.

29:28.375 --> 29:29.899
Do you understand me?

29:29.999 --> 29:30.526
Uh-huh.

29:30.626 --> 29:33.484
I'm sorry. I didn't quite
get that last platitude.

29:33.584 --> 29:35.401
You think you're so tough

29:35.501 --> 29:38.234
'cause you took out
Belthazor, don't you?

29:38.334 --> 29:39.526
Let me tell
you something.

29:39.626 --> 29:42.709
You're only as good
as your next vanquish.

29:43.667 --> 29:46.275
This alley is a
neutral battlefield.

29:46.375 --> 29:49.651
Our challenge is to fight Aames.

29:49.751 --> 29:51.899
Our primary goal is...?

29:51.999 --> 29:53.025
To win!

29:53.125 --> 29:54.234
No.

29:54.334 --> 29:54.899
No.

29:54.999 --> 29:57.876
It's to get
the crossbow.

29:59.542 --> 30:01.192
A darklighter's crossbow
delivers arrows

30:01.292 --> 30:04.442
dipped in a poison
that is lethal to whitelighters.

30:04.542 --> 30:05.942
Get the crossbow,

30:06.042 --> 30:07.983
and the immediate
threat is over.

30:08.083 --> 30:10.818
If you have the opportunity

30:10.918 --> 30:12.067
to vanquish
Aames,

30:12.167 --> 30:13.900
by all means,
seize it.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.083
But keep your eyes
on the prize.

30:18.501 --> 30:20.942
All right, now
let's pretend
I'm the enemy.

30:21.042 --> 30:22.192
Oh, that is way too easy.

30:22.292 --> 30:24.899
(<i>laughs</i>)
NATALIE:
Very funny.

30:24.999 --> 30:26.067
Now, talk me through

30:26.167 --> 30:29.025
how you plan to separate me
from my crossbow.

30:29.125 --> 30:30.317
PIPER:
Okay.

30:30.417 --> 30:31.734
First, I freeze you.

30:31.834 --> 30:32.899
I deflect that.

30:32.999 --> 30:35.359
I guess I could
levitate and kick you.

30:35.459 --> 30:36.234
NATALIE:
You just

30:36.334 --> 30:37.899
kicked a clone.
PRUE:
All right.

30:37.999 --> 30:38.942
How about
if I send an astral Prue

30:39.042 --> 30:40.401
as a decoy,
and then just, you know.

30:40.501 --> 30:42.067
(<i>board clattering</i>)
PRUE:
Oh.

30:42.167 --> 30:43.484
I'm so sorry.
(<i>laughing</i>)

30:43.584 --> 30:45.900
Not as sorry as you would be

30:46.000 --> 30:49.401
if I just blinked behind you
and stabbed you to death.

30:49.501 --> 30:50.899
Well, that would be bad.

30:50.999 --> 30:51.776
Ouch.

30:51.876 --> 30:52.899
All right,
you know what?

30:52.999 --> 30:53.899
This is
too hard.

30:53.999 --> 30:54.899
Usually in these
situations,

30:54.999 --> 30:56.899
you know, everything happens
so quickly,

30:56.999 --> 30:57.983
the adrenaline is pumping.

30:58.083 --> 30:58.900
I want you
to think

30:59.000 --> 31:02.651
using your brains,
not your glands.

31:02.751 --> 31:04.442
Now try again.

31:04.542 --> 31:05.526
âª I wanna rock right now âª

31:05.626 --> 31:07.609
âª I'm Rob Base,
I came to get down âª

31:07.709 --> 31:09.609
âª I'm not
internationally known âª

31:09.709 --> 31:11.109
âª But I'm known to rock
the microphone âª

31:11.209 --> 31:13.899
âª Because I get stupid,
I mean outrageous âª

31:13.999 --> 31:15.983
âª Stay away
if you're contagious âª

31:16.083 --> 31:18.442
âª 'Cause I'm a winner,
no, I'm not a loser âª

31:18.542 --> 31:21.899
âª To be an MC,
so let's go, 'cause... âª

31:21.999 --> 31:23.125
(<i>gasps</i>)

31:26.999 --> 31:30.899
(<i>pained groaning</i>)

31:30.999 --> 31:34.899
âª It takes two
to make a thing go right âª

31:34.999 --> 31:37.067
âª One, two, three âª

31:37.167 --> 31:39.876
âª Get loose now... âª

31:40.501 --> 31:42.692
(<i>quietly</i>):
Hey, if we don't vanquish Aames,

31:42.792 --> 31:44.899
can we at least
vanquish Natalie?

31:44.999 --> 31:46.651
Don't tempt me.

31:46.751 --> 31:48.275
All right,
I've got the cloning potion

31:48.375 --> 31:49.734
of the vanquishing spell done.

31:49.834 --> 31:51.899
I'm almost done with
the transmogrification.

31:51.999 --> 31:55.359
Mine came out
a little country western.

31:55.459 --> 31:58.192
I am rejectin'
your deflection.

31:58.292 --> 31:59.150
Oh, well, it works for me,

31:59.250 --> 32:01.651
but you'll have to get it past
you know who.

32:01.751 --> 32:02.442
You know,

32:02.542 --> 32:04.609
Leo never had to
approve our spells.

32:04.709 --> 32:05.275
He trusted us.

32:05.375 --> 32:07.899
PRUE:
Yeah, but she said
that she needs to hear it.

32:07.999 --> 32:08.942
Yeah, well,
you know what?

32:09.042 --> 32:11.234
What she needs
none of us
can give her,

32:11.334 --> 32:12.109
all right?

32:12.209 --> 32:12.859
All right, still,

32:12.959 --> 32:14.234
but personal feelings aside,
you kind of

32:14.334 --> 32:16.401
have to admire her
professionally, you know.

32:16.501 --> 32:17.234
She's very dedicated.

32:17.334 --> 32:19.150
Yeah, but
she's not Leo.

32:19.250 --> 32:21.899
How's that spell
coming along?

32:21.999 --> 32:22.899
Great.
All done.

32:22.999 --> 32:25.167
Good.
Here
you go.

32:30.125 --> 32:30.900
Okay.

32:31.000 --> 32:31.900
Let's nail this warlock.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.359
All right, I'll start scrying
for his location.

32:34.459 --> 32:36.192
Uh, no need. I've been
working on a new plan--

32:36.292 --> 32:38.942
one that will allow us
to fight on our turf, not his.

32:39.042 --> 32:40.942
Make him come to us? How?

32:41.042 --> 32:43.692
What he wants
is what you've got.

32:43.792 --> 32:45.692
You're gonna use
yourself as bait.

32:45.792 --> 32:47.609
NATALIE:
If I orb in somewhere

32:47.709 --> 32:48.899
unprotected,
Aames should be able

32:48.999 --> 32:50.899
to track me
with his darklighter powers.

32:50.999 --> 32:52.442
With the three of you
in position,

32:52.542 --> 32:55.275
as soon as Aames shows up,
I orb out.

32:55.375 --> 32:56.859
The advantage is all ours.

32:56.959 --> 32:58.651
No, we can't
let you do that.

32:58.751 --> 32:59.776
It's too dangerous.

32:59.876 --> 33:02.234
I appreciate your concern.

33:02.334 --> 33:04.375
My concern is not for you.

33:05.667 --> 33:07.359
At least not <i>just</i> for you.

33:07.459 --> 33:09.692
My concern is if you fail...

33:09.792 --> 33:10.401
I won't fail.

33:10.501 --> 33:11.567
I've gone over
every permutation.

33:11.667 --> 33:15.375
So long as we follow
the rules, we'll succeed.

33:30.125 --> 33:31.526
Now!

33:31.626 --> 33:32.334
Ooh.

33:36.584 --> 33:37.442
PHOEBE:
Clone!

33:37.542 --> 33:39.067
All right, be ready
with the spell.

33:39.167 --> 33:39.899
He could be anywhere.

33:39.999 --> 33:41.999
Get the crossbow.
(<i>mutters</i>)

33:42.667 --> 33:44.275
PHOEBE:
Wait. Where
is he?

33:44.375 --> 33:45.401
Why isn't he

33:45.501 --> 33:46.942
fighting back?

33:47.042 --> 33:49.067
Uh, maybe 'cause
we got the crossbow.

33:49.167 --> 33:50.899
No, something doesn't
feel right.

33:50.999 --> 33:51.899
This was way too easy.

33:51.999 --> 33:54.025
Or even worse,
anticlimactic.

33:54.125 --> 33:54.983
Well, who cares?

33:55.083 --> 33:57.292
We got the
crossbow, let's go.

34:05.626 --> 34:08.208
(<i>footsteps, door creaking</i>)

34:08.998 --> 34:09.899
(<i>door closes</i>)

34:09.998 --> 34:10.983
NATALIE:
Did you get it?

34:11.083 --> 34:11.899
We got it.

34:11.998 --> 34:13.275
PRUE:
Yeah, but, uh,

34:13.375 --> 34:14.442
we didn't get Aames.

34:14.542 --> 34:15.484
That's all right.

34:15.583 --> 34:17.150
He wasn't our primary goal.

34:17.250 --> 34:18.525
You've done well.

34:18.626 --> 34:19.192
I don't know.

34:19.292 --> 34:20.899
I think he gave up too easily.

34:20.998 --> 34:22.900
Maybe you were just prepared,
and he wasn't.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.859
It was our setting, our timing,
our plan to execute.

34:25.958 --> 34:28.942
Yeah, but we didn't get a chance
to execute it.

34:29.042 --> 34:31.317
We got what we wanted,
and no one got hurt.

34:31.417 --> 34:33.150
This is what happens
when whitelighters

34:33.250 --> 34:34.899
and witches work hard together.

34:34.998 --> 34:35.859
And thanks to you,

34:35.958 --> 34:38.025
they'll get a chance
to do a lot more of it.

34:38.125 --> 34:40.275
I'll bring this up there.

34:40.375 --> 34:41.150
PIPER:
Uh,

34:41.250 --> 34:43.998
does that mean Leo
gets to come back?

34:44.501 --> 34:46.859
That's not my call.

34:46.958 --> 34:48.275
I'll see you later.

34:48.375 --> 34:50.042
(<i>sighs</i>)

34:50.918 --> 34:53.859
So, Aames didn't fight at all?

34:53.958 --> 34:54.899
Not at all.

34:54.998 --> 34:55.900
I flung, he fled.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.317
Did you wait for him,
look for him?

34:58.417 --> 35:00.359
No. We were playing
by the rules.

35:00.459 --> 35:01.983
And we grabbed
the crossbow,

35:02.083 --> 35:03.876
just like you said.

35:04.959 --> 35:06.459
The crossbow...

35:07.999 --> 35:10.209
(<i>Natalie gasps</i>)

35:12.999 --> 35:14.401
(<i>gasps</i>)

35:14.501 --> 35:15.584
Ah...

35:17.999 --> 35:19.359
(<i>Piper grunts</i>)

35:19.459 --> 35:21.999
(<i>shrieks, grunts</i>)

35:22.250 --> 35:23.442
She was right.

35:23.542 --> 35:24.692
Way too easy.

35:24.792 --> 35:26.025
(<i>grunts</i>)

35:26.125 --> 35:27.209
No!

35:27.959 --> 35:29.999
No!

35:41.292 --> 35:43.692
We followed
the stupid rules,

35:43.792 --> 35:44.899
and look what happened.

35:44.999 --> 35:46.067
I hate rules!

35:46.167 --> 35:47.067
I knew something was wrong.

35:47.167 --> 35:48.442
Why didn't I trust my instincts?

35:48.542 --> 35:49.692
PIPER:
Well, none of us did.

35:49.792 --> 35:52.417
But I am going
to now... Leo!

35:53.042 --> 35:54.626
BOTH:
Leo!

35:56.626 --> 35:58.526
Okay, look,
we-we-we did

35:58.626 --> 36:01.317
everything she asked,
I swear!

36:01.417 --> 36:02.609
I know, I was watching.

36:02.709 --> 36:04.275
I wasn't supposed to, but...

36:04.375 --> 36:04.899
enough said.

36:04.999 --> 36:07.567
We're through playing by
the rules, you know.

36:07.667 --> 36:08.899
All right, now we need

36:08.999 --> 36:09.609
to stop Aames.

36:09.709 --> 36:10.526
Well, I know from experience,

36:10.626 --> 36:12.442
darklighter poison
doesn't kill immediately,

36:12.542 --> 36:14.275
so there's still
a window of opportunity.

36:14.375 --> 36:15.567
PRUE:
Great, so we need a plan.

36:15.667 --> 36:16.899
What are our options?

36:16.999 --> 36:17.899
There's only one.

36:17.999 --> 36:19.899
Breaks the rules big time.

36:19.999 --> 36:21.401
You mean...

36:21.501 --> 36:21.899
Uh-huh.

36:21.999 --> 36:23.025
And we...

36:23.125 --> 36:23.484
Yep.

36:23.584 --> 36:24.442
And that will...

36:24.542 --> 36:25.459
I hope.

36:31.501 --> 36:33.317
You'd think dying
would be easier

36:33.417 --> 36:34.078
the second time around,

36:34.088 --> 36:36.899
(<i>moaning</i>)
but it sure
doesn't look like it.

36:36.999 --> 36:40.150
It's useless
to fight the poison!

36:40.250 --> 36:41.818
(<i>groans</i>)

36:41.918 --> 36:44.067
Don't you know...

36:44.167 --> 36:46.192
death's just a beginning.

36:46.292 --> 36:48.899
In this case,
of a lot more death.

36:48.999 --> 36:50.899
How's it feel to know that

36:50.999 --> 36:52.401
you will be responsible

36:52.501 --> 36:56.899
for the end of whitelighters
and witches alike?

36:56.999 --> 36:58.359
The end of good.

36:58.459 --> 36:59.567
(<i>groans</i>)

36:59.667 --> 37:00.651
(<i>gasps</i>)

37:00.751 --> 37:02.942
(<i>whispering</i>):
Do I hear someone coming?

37:03.042 --> 37:04.983
(<i>whimpers</i>)

37:05.083 --> 37:07.567
No.

37:07.667 --> 37:10.083
But I hear someone going.

37:11.999 --> 37:13.999
No...

37:30.709 --> 37:33.401
(<i>grunts</i>)

37:33.501 --> 37:34.899
Ah!

37:34.999 --> 37:37.834
(<i>Aames laughs</i>)

37:42.999 --> 37:44.250
Huh?

37:47.999 --> 37:49.150
Wha...

37:49.250 --> 37:50.692
(<i>grunts</i>)

37:50.792 --> 37:52.942
(<i>screams</i>)

37:53.042 --> 37:54.859
(<i>groaning</i>)

37:54.959 --> 37:58.167
(<i>Aames coughing</i>)

37:59.542 --> 38:01.818
(<i>panting</i>)

38:01.918 --> 38:03.942
What the hell
are you doing up here?

38:04.042 --> 38:05.192
Kicking your ass!

38:05.292 --> 38:07.567
Don't even bother
trying to orb out.

38:07.667 --> 38:08.192
It won't work.

38:08.292 --> 38:09.899
You see, you
didn't just get

38:09.999 --> 38:10.899
the powers of a whitelighter,

38:10.999 --> 38:12.317
but you got
their vulnerability, too.

38:12.417 --> 38:14.899
So the poison in that
arrow is killing you

38:14.999 --> 38:17.401
just like you killed Natalie.

38:17.501 --> 38:19.150
It's kind of poetic.

38:19.250 --> 38:20.651
I'm kind of in a rhyming mood.

38:20.751 --> 38:21.496
How about you girls?
Sure,

38:21.506 --> 38:23.859
this poison isn't working
fast enough for me.

38:23.959 --> 38:25.234
(<i>groans</i>)

38:25.334 --> 38:26.317
ALL:
Time for amends

38:26.417 --> 38:27.401
and the victim's revenge.

38:27.501 --> 38:29.899
PRUE:
Cloning power,
turn sour.
No, no!

38:29.999 --> 38:30.899
Power to change,

38:30.999 --> 38:32.150
turn to strange.
No!

38:32.250 --> 38:34.899
I'm rejectin' your deflection.

38:34.999 --> 38:38.792
(<i>screaming</i>)

38:41.375 --> 38:42.899
Wow, it worked!

38:42.999 --> 38:44.899
Nothing anticlimactic
about that.

38:44.999 --> 38:46.942
(<i>laughs</i>)

38:47.042 --> 38:48.567
PIPER:
Uh-oh.

38:48.667 --> 38:51.125
Here comes one.

38:52.792 --> 38:55.192
Made your whitelighter proud.

38:55.292 --> 38:56.442
PHOEBE:
Thanks, but we

38:56.542 --> 38:57.401
were just winging it.

38:57.501 --> 38:59.651
Well, whatever you
did, it worked.

38:59.751 --> 39:01.942
Well, not as well as
we would have liked.

39:02.042 --> 39:04.317
I'm sorry we
couldn't save Natalie.

39:04.417 --> 39:05.651
I know. Me, too.

39:05.751 --> 39:06.900
But she died
for the greater good.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.375
I know she would have
made that choice herself.

39:10.834 --> 39:13.150
Although I don't think
she would have been too keen

39:13.250 --> 39:13.899
on us orbing up here.

39:13.999 --> 39:16.526
Which is why
we got to get out of here

39:16.626 --> 39:18.359
before we all get in trouble.

39:18.459 --> 39:20.776
Uh... oh, okay,
wait a second.

39:20.876 --> 39:22.109
No five-cent tour,

39:22.209 --> 39:23.918
no meet the Elders?

39:24.792 --> 39:26.526
We're going.

39:26.626 --> 39:27.317
Leo.

39:27.417 --> 39:28.442
It doesn't matter.

39:28.542 --> 39:29.484
It's not like we get

39:29.584 --> 39:30.942
to remember it anyway.

39:31.042 --> 39:33.792
You will this time.
Oh.

39:35.834 --> 39:40.292
(<i>rock music playing</i>)

39:46.000 --> 39:47.899
âª Anabel, you told me âª

39:47.999 --> 39:50.899
âª That in life
you need to cry âª

39:50.999 --> 39:55.792
âª To deal with all the things
that other people leave to die âª

39:56.751 --> 39:57.983
âª Oh, Anabel, I wonder âª

39:58.083 --> 40:00.442
âª If you've ever
asked yourself âª

40:00.542 --> 40:04.109
âª Are you just as happy âª

40:04.209 --> 40:06.609
âª As everybody else? âª

40:06.709 --> 40:10.567
âª Is there
a simple reason why... âª

40:10.667 --> 40:11.192
So I just...

40:11.292 --> 40:12.899
checked the messages at home,

40:12.999 --> 40:13.496
and Reese called,

40:13.506 --> 40:15.442
said he needs to talk to you
about the case.

40:15.542 --> 40:17.109
Really?
Did he say it was urgent?

40:17.209 --> 40:20.651
Well, what could be
urgent about the case?

40:20.751 --> 40:22.776
Um...

40:22.876 --> 40:23.245
Nothing.

40:23.255 --> 40:25.109
Actually, I can't
think of anything

40:25.209 --> 40:26.859
that would be urgent.

40:26.959 --> 40:27.204
I can.

40:27.214 --> 40:29.651
I urgently want Leo
to walk into this bar.

40:29.751 --> 40:30.899
He's been up there
a really long time,

40:30.999 --> 40:32.899
and I'm starting
to get worried.

40:32.999 --> 40:35.067
I don't understand
how they can be mad at him

40:35.167 --> 40:36.150
after we saved their butts.

40:36.250 --> 40:37.942
Well, he broke
some pretty big rules

40:38.042 --> 40:38.609
while doing it.

40:38.709 --> 40:40.609
Yeah, well,
if they hold that against him,

40:40.709 --> 40:42.899
I'm crossing over
to the other side.

40:42.999 --> 40:43.899
Ditto.

40:43.999 --> 40:45.899
Yeah, ditto.

40:45.999 --> 40:48.042
I got to get back to work.

40:52.209 --> 40:55.192
All right, so what's
in that head of yours?

40:55.292 --> 40:56.734
Nothing.

40:56.834 --> 40:58.526
You know that.

40:58.626 --> 41:00.526
Don't joke.

41:00.626 --> 41:03.501
Phoebe, if you want
to talk about it, I'm here.

41:04.626 --> 41:06.150
I just want to help.

41:06.250 --> 41:09.999
Um... I...

41:10.751 --> 41:12.025
I was just worried

41:12.125 --> 41:14.918
about Leo, too, you know.

41:20.375 --> 41:23.292
I'll go get Piper.

41:25.083 --> 41:26.109
Hey.

41:26.209 --> 41:26.900
Hi.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.150
How are you doing?

41:28.250 --> 41:29.776
Oh, I'm great.

41:29.876 --> 41:31.359
Actually, I'm lying,

41:31.459 --> 41:32.876
I'm awful.

41:33.626 --> 41:35.899
Um... I am so sorry

41:35.999 --> 41:37.776
that I am such a screw-up.

41:37.876 --> 41:38.317
Hey, hey,

41:38.417 --> 41:41.442
I'm the one
who should be apologizing.

41:41.542 --> 41:42.401
I let you down.

41:42.501 --> 41:44.609
I should have been watching
more carefully.

41:44.709 --> 41:47.375
Won't happen again, okay?

41:48.584 --> 41:49.899
PIPER:
Hey, hey, hey!

41:49.999 --> 41:51.275
What took so long?
What happened?

41:51.375 --> 41:53.067
Oh, I have some news.

41:53.167 --> 41:53.899
Okay...

41:53.999 --> 41:55.776
Well, obviously they found out

41:55.876 --> 41:56.899
that you'd been up there,

41:56.999 --> 41:59.275
so they decided
to review the facts

41:59.375 --> 42:00.899
of the Natalie situation.

42:00.999 --> 42:03.899
And they
unanimously decided

42:03.999 --> 42:05.776
to lift probation.

42:05.876 --> 42:06.899
What?

42:06.999 --> 42:08.067
Piper...

42:08.167 --> 42:10.442
we're officially engaged.

42:10.542 --> 42:11.275
Oh! Oh!

42:11.375 --> 42:12.401
Oh! Oh!
PHOEBE:
Oh!

42:12.501 --> 42:13.734
Oh, that's so great!

42:13.834 --> 42:14.899
PRUE:
That's great.

42:14.999 --> 42:16.459
Okay!

42:16.999 --> 42:18.584
(<i>laughing</i>)
