00:04.238 --> 00:06.238
- So, are you impressed?
- Wow.

00:06.240 --> 00:09.070
Catch all new episodes Mondays. And
check out our other Fox programs.

00:09.076 --> 00:12.206
Bones, Sleepy Hollow and 24: Legacy.

00:12.212 --> 00:14.952
- Why does it need to be you?
- I'm the only one I can trust.

00:14.953 --> 00:16.078
Only on Fox

00:17.101 --> 00:18.848
A maverick billionaire...

00:18.850 --> 00:20.750
My name is Gideon Reeves.

00:20.752 --> 00:24.473
I built an empire making
rockets, computers, robots...

00:24.475 --> 00:27.157
Made over $100 billion.
Know how I did it?

00:27.159 --> 00:28.825
I'm an engineer.

00:28.827 --> 00:30.694
...touched by tragedy...

00:30.696 --> 00:32.829
- The money!
- No!

00:32.831 --> 00:34.730
My friend has been shot.

00:34.732 --> 00:36.549
Where the hell are you people?!

00:36.551 --> 00:39.385
...takes on the
biggest engineering challenge

00:39.387 --> 00:40.554
of his career...

00:40.556 --> 00:42.088
I want justice for Elliot James Sully.

00:42.090 --> 00:44.791
Give me the 13th district to run.

00:44.793 --> 00:47.460
A civilian can't take
over a police district.

00:47.462 --> 00:49.829
They can, with a special
appointment from this committee.

00:49.831 --> 00:52.665
... to revolutionize a police force...

00:52.667 --> 00:54.701
Technology doesn't solve cases, cops do.

00:54.703 --> 00:56.269
You haven't met my technology.

00:58.973 --> 01:01.140
Wow...

01:01.142 --> 01:02.975
...and save a city.

01:02.977 --> 01:05.293
You guys are my partners.

01:05.295 --> 01:06.713
We're gonna change the world.

01:12.887 --> 01:14.821
You sure nobody
followed you here?

01:14.823 --> 01:17.290
No, man. We're all good.

01:17.292 --> 01:18.991
All right, show me, don't tell me.

01:18.993 --> 01:20.226
Target ready?

01:20.228 --> 01:22.207
Ready as she's gonna be.

01:29.108 --> 01:30.970
We had to use female mannequins?

01:30.972 --> 01:32.805
This is an old dress factory.

01:32.807 --> 01:34.941
There were no, like, dude-equins.

01:39.147 --> 01:41.180
Nice shot, Murph.

01:44.686 --> 01:46.052
Impressive.

01:46.054 --> 01:48.154
Maybe too impressive.

01:48.156 --> 01:49.422
See?

01:49.424 --> 01:52.258
Armor-piercing bullets,
just like I said.

01:52.260 --> 01:54.627
Not even our new vests can stop 'em.

01:54.629 --> 01:57.373
Tico, you got these bullets from Hunter?

01:57.375 --> 01:59.432
Yep, badass assault rifle, too.

01:59.434 --> 02:00.566
Illegal in all 50 states.

02:00.568 --> 02:02.241
And that ain't even the half of it.

02:02.243 --> 02:03.803
You can get anything from Hunter.

02:03.805 --> 02:08.508
You can buy guns and ammo to
bring down a freaking tank.

02:08.509 --> 02:10.076
No joke, guys. A tank.

02:12.009 --> 02:13.679
Think about that.

02:13.681 --> 02:17.517
Local gangbangers get
that kind of firepower?

02:17.519 --> 02:19.118
No.

02:19.120 --> 02:21.187
We got to put Hunter
out of business ASAP.

02:21.189 --> 02:22.789
Yeah...

02:23.755 --> 02:25.625
...his testimony is not gonna cut it.

02:26.661 --> 02:27.894
If you want Hunter arrested,

02:27.896 --> 02:29.128
you're gonna need more.

02:29.130 --> 02:30.897
You hear that, Tico?

02:32.133 --> 02:33.900
Got to get me a face-to-face, pal.

02:35.937 --> 02:39.205
No, you-you think Hunter's
just gonna sell to anyone?

02:39.207 --> 02:41.874
Well, he sells to you,
doesn't he? Set it up.

02:44.012 --> 02:45.516
Uh, that's not gonna work.

02:45.518 --> 02:48.114
Um, then I guess we're not gonna
help you with your drug charges

02:48.116 --> 02:49.382
after all.

02:49.384 --> 02:50.953
You heard the boss lady.

02:50.955 --> 02:53.119
Guys, come on. Y-Y-You expect me

02:53.121 --> 02:55.188
to walk up to Hunter
with a freakin' cop?

02:55.190 --> 02:56.789
That's a death sentence for me.

02:56.791 --> 02:59.325
Only if he finds out, which he won't.

03:02.530 --> 03:06.732
- Come on.
- O-Okay. Yeah, yeah.

03:06.734 --> 03:08.868
Yeah, I-I'll see what I can do.

03:08.870 --> 03:10.236
Good.

03:10.238 --> 03:12.338
We should get to the precinct,
run this up the chain.

03:12.340 --> 03:14.807
Tico, you get the ball
rolling with Hunter.

03:17.178 --> 03:19.245
Till the brass signs off.

03:19.247 --> 03:21.133
Gonna take this bastard down.

03:23.231 --> 03:28.168

03:31.022 --> 03:34.227
Yes, Murphy, there is a
Santa Claus, and it's me.

03:34.229 --> 03:36.429
I am the St. Nick of law enforcement.

03:36.431 --> 03:37.697
Do you have any idea

03:37.699 --> 03:39.832
how much stuff my elves have
brought into the department

03:39.834 --> 03:40.933
this week alone?

03:40.935 --> 03:43.269
We boosted the horsepower in the Caddys,

03:43.271 --> 03:44.637
we improved the flashbang grenades.

03:44.639 --> 03:46.639
Hell, even the coffee is better.

03:46.641 --> 03:48.107
I don't understand why

03:48.109 --> 03:50.676
there's this vendetta against
me and everything that I'm doing.

03:50.678 --> 03:53.877
Gideon, the coffee's great, but
don't expect milk and cookies

03:53.879 --> 03:55.246
from the mayor. You pissed him off.

03:55.248 --> 03:58.484
So what, now he... he sends
the state attorney's office

03:58.486 --> 04:00.353
- to investigate me?
- Oh, no.

04:00.355 --> 04:02.889
Not just any ASA. My ex-husband.

04:02.891 --> 04:04.991
Scott's gonna continue
talking to our cops

04:04.993 --> 04:06.525
until he finds one that tells him

04:06.527 --> 04:08.194
exactly what he wants to hear.

04:08.196 --> 04:10.596
What time is this witch
hunt supposed to start?

04:10.598 --> 04:11.831
Scott's not here yet,

04:11.833 --> 04:14.100
but he did send a list of
people he wants to talk to,

04:14.102 --> 04:15.534
starting with Officer Reyes.

04:15.536 --> 04:19.005
The officer who
took a bullet on my watch.

04:19.007 --> 04:22.074
Yes, I imagine his review of my tenure

04:22.076 --> 04:23.542
will be less than glowing.

04:23.544 --> 04:25.645
Conrad's gonna talk to Reyes

04:25.647 --> 04:27.780
once he's done screaming at Brandt.

04:27.782 --> 04:29.649
This guy sweeps
everyone for bugs.

04:29.651 --> 04:30.716
It's just too dangerous.

04:30.718 --> 04:31.684
It doesn't make sense, Captain.

04:31.686 --> 04:33.019
What's going on in there?

04:33.021 --> 04:33.826
Soldier?

04:33.828 --> 04:36.622
Bit of a situation.
We've been building a case

04:36.624 --> 04:38.891
on a big-time weapon dealer.
Brandt had a connection,

04:38.893 --> 04:40.626
so we had him doing
some undercover work.

04:40.628 --> 04:42.094
Getting the sense there may be an issue.

04:42.096 --> 04:43.162
Oh, yeah.

04:43.164 --> 04:44.797
Brandt's supposed to make his first buy,

04:44.799 --> 04:46.132
but Conrad won't sign off.

04:46.134 --> 04:47.974
They've been going at
it like this all morning.

04:48.776 --> 04:50.803
Well, I came here to fix problems.

04:50.805 --> 04:52.144
You're making a bad call.

04:52.146 --> 04:54.047
No, I'm making a safe call.

04:54.049 --> 04:55.474
What seems to be the problem?

04:55.476 --> 04:56.709
Remember me?

04:56.711 --> 04:58.640
Dashing billionaire genius
who bought the place?

04:58.642 --> 05:01.347
I spent the last six
months working this C.I.

05:01.349 --> 05:03.383
Now the captain says I got to step away.

05:03.385 --> 05:04.650
He's a trained soldier.

05:04.652 --> 05:05.751
It's just a friggin' buy-walk.

05:05.753 --> 05:08.054
This guy sweeps everyone for bugs.

05:08.056 --> 05:10.356
If you wear a wire, he's gonna find it

05:10.358 --> 05:12.325
and I'm not sending you
in there without a wire.

05:12.327 --> 05:13.693
End of discussion.

05:13.695 --> 05:15.328
Hang on. Hypothetically,

05:15.330 --> 05:16.562
what if we had surveillance equipment

05:16.564 --> 05:17.930
that he couldn't detect?

05:17.932 --> 05:21.240
I know this kind of thing is
like engineering catnip to you,

05:21.242 --> 05:23.869
but before you start
scratching the sofa,

05:23.871 --> 05:27.606
this is an officer's
life we're talking about.

05:27.608 --> 05:30.710
As long as this son of
a bitch is out there,

05:30.712 --> 05:32.912
selling armor-piercing bullets,

05:32.914 --> 05:35.648
every damn cop in the city is a target.

05:35.650 --> 05:37.350
If you can build something, Gideon,

05:37.352 --> 05:38.884
then build it.

05:38.886 --> 05:41.220
Do you really think this
is something you can do?

05:41.222 --> 05:42.521
Come with me.

05:45.493 --> 05:47.093
So what are we dealing with, here?

05:47.095 --> 05:48.928
How exactly do these searches go

05:48.930 --> 05:50.663
in an undercover situation?

05:50.665 --> 05:52.298
Well, Hunter usually
has one of those guns

05:52.300 --> 05:53.899
that look for radio waves.

05:53.901 --> 05:56.168
An RF scanner. All right,
all right, all right,

05:56.170 --> 05:59.005
so, uh, what I'm thinking is:

05:59.007 --> 06:02.375
if we transmit in bursts,
say every seven minutes,

06:02.377 --> 06:04.221
they're gonna have a
hard time picking it up.

06:04.223 --> 06:06.145
Wait, so are you saying
that we're only gonna be

06:06.147 --> 06:07.580
in contact with Brandt
every seven minutes?

06:07.582 --> 06:09.315
It's based on a system I developed

06:09.317 --> 06:11.183
for our spy satellites. Basically,

06:11.185 --> 06:13.686
the less something transmits,
the harder it is to find.

06:13.688 --> 06:15.021
Too risky.

06:15.023 --> 06:17.056
Yeah, well, the best moves usually are.

06:17.058 --> 06:18.724
So, this is what I'm thinking.

06:21.821 --> 06:24.330
Hook up a camera like this
to a microscopic transmitter.

06:24.332 --> 06:25.364
That's a camera?

06:25.366 --> 06:26.899
It's from Reeves Medical.

06:26.901 --> 06:28.534
It's used for surgery.

06:28.536 --> 06:30.336
And then we hide it
with a small microphone

06:30.338 --> 06:32.605
in a piece of clothing.
Like maybe a button, right?

06:32.607 --> 06:34.206
- Would that work?
- Sounds all right.

06:34.208 --> 06:35.875
Cool, and then we just
have to get the video

06:35.877 --> 06:37.309
and the audio to the transmitter.

06:37.311 --> 06:39.445
Pete, what's the smallest wire

06:39.447 --> 06:40.679
that could handle that much data?

06:42.483 --> 06:46.252
Uh, probably...

06:46.254 --> 06:48.087
something like this.

06:48.089 --> 06:49.288
Mm, that's too big.

06:49.290 --> 06:51.590
- I mean, they'll find that.
- We're talking

06:51.592 --> 06:53.893
seven minutes of video in
a three-second transfer.

06:53.895 --> 06:56.228
It's like running the Chicago
River through a garden hose.

06:56.230 --> 06:58.931
Pete, when a woman
tells you size matters,

06:58.933 --> 07:00.566
it's best to stop arguing.

07:02.003 --> 07:04.904
Hold on a second.

07:10.878 --> 07:13.345
What if the wire is the clothes?

07:13.347 --> 07:14.690
This is made

07:14.692 --> 07:16.782
of Reeves Industries smart fabric.

07:16.784 --> 07:19.518
Each thread is actually a tiny wire.

07:19.520 --> 07:21.053
What if we make this into a jacket?

07:21.055 --> 07:22.254
- A jacket?
- Pete,

07:22.256 --> 07:24.256
you used to sew your own
wrestling costumes, right?

07:24.258 --> 07:28.127
Gideon, you're talking
about a $2 million jacket.

07:28.129 --> 07:30.096
All right, so...

07:30.098 --> 07:33.132
put some sequins on
it, make it look nice.

07:33.134 --> 07:35.501
Let's do this.

07:38.206 --> 07:39.472
Hey.

07:39.474 --> 07:41.073
I'm not on the board, what's going on?

07:41.075 --> 07:43.309
ASA Murphy wants to talk to you.

07:43.311 --> 07:44.643
About what?

07:44.645 --> 07:46.378
You'll have to ask him.

07:49.517 --> 07:50.683
Reyes,

07:50.685 --> 07:51.917
hold up.

07:51.919 --> 07:55.193
A little advice from
someone who's been there:

07:55.195 --> 07:57.189
when you're talking to
lawyers from the city,

07:57.191 --> 07:59.625
keep your eyes open and stay sharp.

07:59.627 --> 08:02.862
You're the one who swore
to protect and serve.

08:02.864 --> 08:05.898
Folks outside the department,
they have another agenda.

08:05.900 --> 08:07.800
As long as you remember
whose side you're on,

08:07.802 --> 08:08.834
you'll be fine.

08:08.836 --> 08:10.429
Got it?

08:13.074 --> 08:14.773
Yeah.

09:16.938 --> 09:18.971
I don't get it. What
the hell is this thing?

09:18.973 --> 09:22.703
The world's first bespoke
surveillance jacket.

09:22.705 --> 09:24.005
Inside that snap,

09:24.007 --> 09:25.511
that's your camera.

09:25.513 --> 09:27.479
What it sees, we see.

09:27.481 --> 09:30.816
Okay, that's not my best
angle, but you get the idea.

09:30.818 --> 09:32.885
I added all these flaps to the pockets,

09:32.887 --> 09:34.153
so they don't gape.

09:35.056 --> 09:36.455
Yeah, it's pretty sweet.

09:36.457 --> 09:37.923
Can I keep it?

09:37.925 --> 09:39.058
Uh, no.

09:39.060 --> 09:41.227
That jacket is worth
more than this building.

09:43.364 --> 09:44.496
Okay,

09:44.498 --> 09:46.832
everybody, it is officially showtime.

09:46.834 --> 09:49.602
Squad 1309, we're preparing to enter.

09:49.604 --> 09:51.704
Christmas morning, finally here.

09:51.706 --> 09:53.205
What, are you just jealous

09:53.207 --> 09:54.840
'cause I'm about to
make a Class X felony

09:54.842 --> 09:56.242
while you got to wait in the car?

09:57.311 --> 09:58.344
Cobb, are you in place?

09:58.346 --> 10:00.112
Yeah, south entrance is covered.

10:00.114 --> 10:01.580
Ready on our end.

10:01.582 --> 10:02.751
Okay, listen to me.

10:02.753 --> 10:04.750
Make this buy and get out.

10:04.752 --> 10:06.868
If anything doesn't sit
well with you in there...

10:06.870 --> 10:08.954
Anything at all... Get out sooner.

10:08.956 --> 10:10.422
I will.

10:11.459 --> 10:13.726
Brandt, just one more thing.

10:13.728 --> 10:15.794
What's up?

10:17.265 --> 10:18.197
You religious at all?

10:18.199 --> 10:19.732
Only when the Cubs are playing.

10:21.402 --> 10:22.635
My mother bought me this

10:22.637 --> 10:24.103
when I graduated the academy.

10:24.105 --> 10:25.237
It's St. Michael,

10:25.239 --> 10:26.939
the patron saint of cops.

10:26.941 --> 10:29.108
So far, it's kept me safe on the job.

10:33.714 --> 10:36.315
Thanks.

10:39.320 --> 10:41.487
All right, it's time to roll.

11:06.284 --> 11:08.247
Here he is. Like I said.

11:11.585 --> 11:12.951
I heard good things.

11:13.470 --> 11:14.570
I'm Nick.

11:14.572 --> 11:17.022
Yo, Nick is dope as hell, man.

11:17.024 --> 11:18.290
He gets deals done.

11:18.292 --> 11:19.792
This is going to be great, guys.

11:19.794 --> 11:21.493
Let's hope so.

11:22.496 --> 11:24.229
Check them both.

11:28.449 --> 11:29.782
Turn around.

11:36.997 --> 11:38.896
Turn around.

11:54.352 --> 11:56.052
That's a nice damn jacket, bro.

11:57.676 --> 11:58.975
They're clean.

11:58.977 --> 12:00.710
See, no problems.

12:00.712 --> 12:03.246
We'll see about that.

12:03.248 --> 12:05.248
Gideon.

12:05.250 --> 12:08.752
Look, I know I signed off,
but this is making me nervous.

12:08.754 --> 12:10.286
I got that sense, yes.

12:10.288 --> 12:13.757
- Trust me, the jacket works.
- Yeah, well,

12:13.759 --> 12:16.693
you know, I remember when the
CPD introduced computers here...

12:16.695 --> 12:19.829
with all kinds of talk
about making our jobs easier,

12:19.831 --> 12:21.231
increasing efficiency, all of that.

12:21.233 --> 12:22.766
Well, the data bears that out.

12:22.768 --> 12:25.101
The computers were great, too,

12:25.103 --> 12:27.000
until they weren't.

12:27.002 --> 12:28.705
About a month after we switched over,

12:28.707 --> 12:30.240
the entire system went down.

12:30.242 --> 12:33.209
We damn near let a murderer walk.

12:33.211 --> 12:35.545
Had to use every available officer

12:35.547 --> 12:40.050
to, uh, rebuild a month-long
case in a day, by hand.

12:40.052 --> 12:41.985
Well, I can assure you

12:41.987 --> 12:43.653
technology has come a long way

12:43.655 --> 12:45.155
since the Commodore 64.

12:45.157 --> 12:48.091
Yeah, and I'm gonna trust you on that.

12:48.093 --> 12:51.094
But in this business, you
learn to hope for the best

12:51.096 --> 12:52.796
and prepare for the worst.

12:52.798 --> 12:54.964
So I need to know you're prepared.

12:55.982 --> 12:58.917
Don't worry, Captain, I got this.

13:04.309 --> 13:08.478
Here's your money. Ten
grand, cash, small bills.

13:08.480 --> 13:12.126
If you want to count... count.

13:12.128 --> 13:14.017
I'm sure it's good.

13:14.019 --> 13:16.753
How long have you been working
with my friend Tico here?

13:16.755 --> 13:19.645
Oh, met in the service, '04.

13:19.647 --> 13:22.392
Reconnected, what? It's
got to be six months now.

13:22.394 --> 13:24.894
Six months. Six months.

13:24.896 --> 13:27.864
Hunter was overseas, too, man. Iraq.

13:27.866 --> 13:28.932
Yeah, I heard that.

13:28.934 --> 13:31.404
You two do a lot of business together?

13:31.406 --> 13:32.904
Well, it's been a little slow lately,

13:32.906 --> 13:35.004
but, like, we're pretty
much partners...

13:35.006 --> 13:36.385
- ...which I think that...
- Tico.

13:36.387 --> 13:37.753
I'm talking to him.

13:39.711 --> 13:41.845
- Is there a problem?
- There's no problem.

13:41.847 --> 13:43.713
I just like to know
who I'm working with.

13:43.715 --> 13:46.749
It's like Tico said, we're tight.

13:46.751 --> 13:48.451
Partners.

13:48.453 --> 13:50.787
Partners? Huh.

13:50.789 --> 13:52.555
Well, that's...

13:52.557 --> 13:54.591
that's good to know.

13:59.798 --> 14:02.765
I thought we weren't
sending him in there blind.

14:02.767 --> 14:05.568
Another 30 seconds, the
first burst will come in,

14:05.570 --> 14:07.170
and then it's every
seven minutes after that.

14:07.172 --> 14:09.572
But in between each transmission...

14:11.310 --> 14:12.575
We're looking at it.

14:12.577 --> 14:14.920
Okay...

14:14.922 --> 14:16.364
five seconds out.

14:17.376 --> 14:18.575
Here's the first video file.

14:19.918 --> 14:22.452
Just like I said, heard good things.

14:22.454 --> 14:23.520
There he is.

14:23.522 --> 14:25.121
Still standing.

14:25.123 --> 14:27.457
At least he was seven minutes ago.

14:27.459 --> 14:29.392
He gets deals done.

14:29.394 --> 14:30.894
Murphy, we see him.

14:30.896 --> 14:32.695
We're scanning through the
rest of the seven minutes

14:32.697 --> 14:34.297
to make sure he's okay.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.400
Everything going okay?

14:37.402 --> 14:39.302
That's a nice damn jacket, bro.

14:39.304 --> 14:40.970
Jacket passed.

14:40.972 --> 14:42.305
So far so good.

14:42.307 --> 14:44.641
You ask me, a seven-minute delay

14:44.643 --> 14:46.376
is seven minutes too long.

14:46.378 --> 14:47.977
Look, I don't love it either,

14:47.979 --> 14:49.345
but Brandt wanted to go in.

14:49.347 --> 14:51.614
Let's be real here, he's
an adrenaline junkie.

14:51.616 --> 14:53.183
This dude'll chase a shiny nickel

14:53.185 --> 14:55.485
off the Hancock building
just to get some action.

14:55.487 --> 14:58.209
I know you're worried,
Goss. I'm worried, too.

15:04.629 --> 15:05.962
Captain said you wanted to see me?

15:05.964 --> 15:08.498
Officer Reyes, come
in, please. Have a seat.

15:09.105 --> 15:10.372
How you feeling?

15:10.374 --> 15:12.570
Well, I'll be better once
I'm back on full duty.

15:12.572 --> 15:14.226
Of course.

15:14.228 --> 15:17.106
Now, listen, you've probably
heard that I'm evaluating

15:17.108 --> 15:19.075
the recent changes here at the 13th.

15:19.077 --> 15:20.143
You mean Gideon?

15:20.145 --> 15:23.213
Well, the legality of
his innovations, yes.

15:23.215 --> 15:25.148
And how they impact officers' safety,

15:25.150 --> 15:26.816
more importantly.

15:26.818 --> 15:29.586
Look... we just want to make sure

15:29.588 --> 15:33.256
that his toys aren't
putting cops at risk.

15:33.258 --> 15:34.757
And I think that you, more than anyone,

15:34.759 --> 15:37.393
more than anyone else
here, you can speak to that.

15:37.395 --> 15:39.629
I did notice that you mentioned

15:39.631 --> 15:43.933
that both the new Taser
firearm and the drone

15:43.935 --> 15:45.201
were problematic in operation.

15:45.203 --> 15:47.089
I wrote a report.

15:47.091 --> 15:49.672
Well, I'd like to know a
little bit more about that.

15:49.674 --> 15:51.541
And I was hoping that
you'd take me through

15:51.543 --> 15:52.775
the details of your shooting.

15:55.426 --> 15:58.248
Actually, I was thinking

15:58.250 --> 16:00.149
you could take me back to the scene.

16:01.853 --> 16:03.286
That way you can walk me through

16:03.288 --> 16:04.921
exactly what happened and where.

16:04.923 --> 16:05.989
How about that?

16:08.159 --> 16:10.660
Officer Reyes?

16:10.662 --> 16:13.329
Yeah.

16:14.432 --> 16:15.798
Yeah, of course.

16:17.240 --> 16:19.202
I still got eyes on the south entrance,

16:19.204 --> 16:21.037
but there's more traffic
coming in and out of here

16:21.039 --> 16:22.382
than the Kennedy.

16:22.384 --> 16:24.240
How long does it take
to buy some bullets?

16:24.242 --> 16:26.209
It shouldn't be longer than 15 minutes.

16:26.211 --> 16:28.111
Ah, Brandt's probably just showing off,

16:28.113 --> 16:29.448
trying to make it last.

16:29.450 --> 16:31.617
Guy's been jonesing for this for weeks.

16:31.619 --> 16:33.316
Gideon, how's that transmission?

16:33.318 --> 16:35.885
Next transmission is three minutes out.

16:37.422 --> 16:40.790
You got the ammo, or we're
not gonna do this thing?

16:40.792 --> 16:42.892
- 'Cause I'll just leave.
- Hey, but, I mean,

16:42.894 --> 16:44.827
we're not gonna cancel, right?

16:44.829 --> 16:46.496
'Cause he's definitely got it on him.

16:46.498 --> 16:48.234
So what's the holdup?

16:48.236 --> 16:50.903
I'm actually glad that you asked.

16:51.269 --> 16:53.703
Now, you see, a couple of days ago,

16:53.705 --> 16:55.772
somebody broke into my warehouse,

16:55.774 --> 16:58.441
and they stole half a dozen

16:58.443 --> 17:00.543
of my best 50 cals.

17:00.545 --> 17:02.857
Yo, that's crazy, man.

17:02.859 --> 17:04.347
- That got nothing to do...
- Shh, shh! Tico, Tico...

17:04.348 --> 17:06.449
- Let me finish.
- Uh, yeah.

17:06.451 --> 17:09.618
So what I did is I asked around.

17:09.621 --> 17:12.021
I said, "Anybody know anything?

17:12.022 --> 17:12.954
Anybody hear anything?"

17:12.957 --> 17:16.626
And you know what? Somebody did.

17:16.627 --> 17:17.859
And you know what they heard?

17:17.862 --> 17:21.531
They heard that your boy Tico here

17:21.532 --> 17:25.034
was going around shooting his mouth off

17:25.036 --> 17:27.170
about this big score
that he had just made.

17:27.172 --> 17:29.405
Right? On the same day,

17:29.407 --> 17:32.475
the same day that I got ripped off.

17:32.477 --> 17:34.584
Then I... I started thinking,

17:34.586 --> 17:38.815
maybe Tico's big score
and my missing guns

17:38.817 --> 17:40.717
were the same thing.

17:40.719 --> 17:43.619
How bad is business, Tico?

17:43.621 --> 17:45.188
Huh?

17:45.190 --> 17:46.322
Was it so tough

17:46.324 --> 17:50.727
that you would do something so stupid

17:50.729 --> 17:52.061
as to try to make a buck

17:52.063 --> 17:54.549
by stealing from me?

17:54.551 --> 17:56.699
Hunter, listen, man, I...

17:56.701 --> 17:59.202
Calm yourself, pretty boy.

17:59.204 --> 18:03.840
All right, all right,
here comes the next burst.

18:03.842 --> 18:06.383
Ada, play speed times four.

18:07.212 --> 18:09.879
Murphy, we're reviewing it now.

18:09.881 --> 18:12.081
All good so far.

18:16.488 --> 18:19.322
Guys, we might have a problem here.

18:19.324 --> 18:20.542
Play speed normal.

18:20.544 --> 18:22.645
...by stealing from me?

18:24.792 --> 18:27.230
This thing's going
sideways, Brandt's in trouble.

18:27.232 --> 18:28.531
Get in there. Go, now!

18:28.533 --> 18:30.133
We're on our way.

18:44.639 --> 18:46.606
- Nothing in here.
- Yeah, I'm empty, too.

18:49.535 --> 18:51.053
We never saw Hunter leave, so

18:51.055 --> 18:52.321
we need to shut off the exits,

18:52.323 --> 18:54.624
get all units out here
to search out the garage.

18:54.626 --> 18:56.893
No, Brandt's not
in the garage anymore.

18:56.895 --> 18:57.995
He had this in his pocket.

18:57.997 --> 18:59.666
He must have left it here for a reason.

18:59.668 --> 19:01.964
Look, tire marks.

19:01.966 --> 19:03.433
Hunter already switched the cars.

19:05.138 --> 19:07.881
They took him, Gideon. He's gone.

19:13.194 --> 19:15.795
Okay, everyone,
we have an officer missing

19:15.797 --> 19:19.032
and our job is to do everything
we can to get him back.

19:19.034 --> 19:21.034
Ada, you ready for the
next contact with Brandt?

19:21.036 --> 19:23.069
20 seconds out from a transmission.

19:23.071 --> 19:24.771
A total of 32 cars

19:24.773 --> 19:26.873
have exited the garage
since Brandt went in.

19:26.875 --> 19:28.474
I could send an "all-call,"

19:28.476 --> 19:31.130
- but they can't handle that many cars.
- Ten.

19:31.132 --> 19:32.912
You don't have a GPS on that thing?

19:32.914 --> 19:36.383
He was going to one parking
garage, we didn't need it.

19:36.385 --> 19:37.747
When the next burst comes in,

19:37.749 --> 19:39.519
we can triangulate Brandt's signal.

19:39.521 --> 19:42.288
Waiting for the "I told you so."

19:42.290 --> 19:44.857
That's not how I roll, Mr. Reeves.

19:44.859 --> 19:48.795
When something goes wrong,
we're all in it together.

19:50.532 --> 19:52.031
- Five seconds.
- Okay.

19:52.033 --> 19:53.700
All right, get ready to triangulate.

19:53.702 --> 19:55.101
- We need his location.
- Okay.

20:01.409 --> 20:02.842
No, no, no, no, no.

20:02.844 --> 20:05.011
- Damn it, Ada!
- The transfer was too short.

20:05.013 --> 20:06.546
I can't get a read on him.

20:06.548 --> 20:08.681
They're three-second transmissions.

20:08.683 --> 20:10.083
I can barely get anything.

20:10.085 --> 20:11.884
I can try again in seven minutes.

20:11.886 --> 20:14.320
Shh, shh. Oh, the camera's blocked!

20:14.322 --> 20:16.923
- I can't see a damn...
- Listen!

20:18.026 --> 20:19.625
You're making a mistake, man.

20:19.627 --> 20:22.261
We'll talk later.
For now, keep your mouth shut.

20:22.263 --> 20:23.296
Take it back.

20:23.298 --> 20:25.999
That last part.

20:27.335 --> 20:29.402
Hear that rumble?

20:29.404 --> 20:30.870
That's the El.

20:30.872 --> 20:33.039
There can't be that many
tracks in that neighborhood.

20:33.041 --> 20:34.073
Okay, I'm enlarging the map.

20:34.075 --> 20:35.708
Murphy, he's-he's near the El.

20:35.710 --> 20:38.111
They've got Brandt in a car,
the camera's totally blocked

20:38.113 --> 20:39.445
so we can't see anything.

20:39.447 --> 20:41.047
But we can hear.

20:42.162 --> 20:43.583
How long ago did they pass it?

20:43.585 --> 20:44.851
About three minutes.

20:44.853 --> 20:46.886
- Okay, there's an El that crosses at...
- Arden.

20:53.728 --> 20:56.462
Just hang on, Brandt. We are coming.

20:59.300 --> 21:02.035
Officers Murphy, Cobb, and
I were pursuing the suspect

21:02.037 --> 21:04.203
north on Hobsen when we
lost him down an alley.

21:04.205 --> 21:06.873
Gideon's, you know, drone
thing picked up his trail.

21:06.875 --> 21:08.008
Led us here.

21:08.010 --> 21:09.307
Was it any more difficult to work

21:09.309 --> 21:10.576
in the presence of a drone?

21:10.578 --> 21:12.945
Well, it surprised the hell
out of us, that's for sure.

21:12.947 --> 21:14.747
Yeah, I bet.

21:18.802 --> 21:23.122
Did the drone also lead you up
the stairs where you were shot,

21:23.124 --> 21:24.624
or was that your decision?

21:27.195 --> 21:28.528
He's headed upstairs.

21:29.631 --> 21:31.864
And where exactly was the suspect

21:31.866 --> 21:33.499
when you were shot?

21:33.501 --> 21:35.001
The next floor.

21:35.003 --> 21:37.070
The weapon Mr. Reeves
had issued to the department,

21:37.072 --> 21:40.173
it's got two modes, right?
It's got lethal and non-lethal.

21:40.175 --> 21:41.574
Yeah, that's correct.

21:44.112 --> 21:47.246
Did that gun feel comfortable to you

21:47.248 --> 21:50.121
when you fired the shot?

21:57.859 --> 21:59.058
Officer Reyes?

21:59.060 --> 22:02.428
Officer Reyes, are you okay to continue?

22:05.300 --> 22:06.299
I'm sorry, I...

22:06.301 --> 22:07.400
I got to get some air.

22:17.840 --> 22:19.812
Everything okay out here?

22:19.814 --> 22:20.947
Yeah.

22:20.949 --> 22:22.515
I just...

22:22.517 --> 22:24.984
The memories came back
stronger than I thought.

22:26.654 --> 22:28.254
Is there anything I can do to help?

22:28.256 --> 22:30.389
No.

22:30.391 --> 22:32.859
No, I just...

22:32.861 --> 22:34.193
I needed to catch my breath.

22:35.218 --> 22:37.296
You been experiencing
a lot of this anxiety

22:37.298 --> 22:39.065
since the incident?

22:39.067 --> 22:41.000
Not before you brought me back here.

22:41.002 --> 22:42.869
Well, you know, if you'd
like to file a grievance,

22:42.871 --> 22:43.870
I'd be happy to help.

22:43.872 --> 22:45.371
I don't need any help.

22:46.525 --> 22:49.220
You're the one who wanted to
take a walk down memory lane.

22:59.420 --> 23:02.021
So if Hunter stayed straight there...

23:02.023 --> 23:03.456
He wouldn't, there's sewer repairs.

23:03.458 --> 23:04.624
That whole block is a cluster.

23:04.626 --> 23:06.359
Yeah, a guy like Hunter would know that.

23:06.361 --> 23:08.060
Well, where would a right turn take him?

23:08.062 --> 23:09.529
Past the 16th District,

23:09.531 --> 23:12.165
which he would also
avoid like the plague.

23:12.167 --> 23:13.733
So left would be his best bet.

23:16.037 --> 23:17.837
Okay, guys, if we take the time we heard

23:17.839 --> 23:18.938
Hunter start his engine,

23:18.940 --> 23:20.873
and then we estimate
how long it would take

23:20.875 --> 23:22.575
for his car to reach the exit,

23:22.577 --> 23:24.110
then this is what you get.

23:24.796 --> 23:26.445
That's got to be Hunter's vehicle.

23:26.447 --> 23:27.980
He's headed north on Sixth.

23:27.982 --> 23:29.315
That's in line with the El.

23:29.317 --> 23:31.050
Murphy, got the car.

23:31.052 --> 23:33.019
Can you do anything about traffic?

23:33.021 --> 23:34.520
I mean, yeah, I guess I could

23:34.522 --> 23:36.289
try to trigger red lights from here.

23:37.792 --> 23:38.925
All right.

23:38.927 --> 23:41.394
We stopped traffic

23:41.396 --> 23:43.095
northbound on Sixth.

23:43.097 --> 23:44.163
Looking for...

23:44.999 --> 23:46.566
...that.

23:46.568 --> 23:48.134
Got it.

23:48.136 --> 23:49.335
We'll set up at the end of Eighth

23:49.337 --> 23:50.670
and we'll work down. Cobb?

23:50.672 --> 23:51.504
Yeah.

23:51.506 --> 23:54.473
1312 in pursuit.

23:56.211 --> 23:57.543
What about Brandt? Any update?

23:57.545 --> 23:59.645
Okay, we're receiving
a transmission now.

24:06.072 --> 24:07.605
Oh, my God.

24:07.607 --> 24:08.921
What's going on?

24:08.923 --> 24:09.847
What is it?

24:09.849 --> 24:11.031
We're too late.

24:11.033 --> 24:12.592
They aren't on the road anymore.

24:12.594 --> 24:14.160
Where's Brandt?

24:14.162 --> 24:15.394
No, no.

24:17.144 --> 24:18.998
Gideon, I need a location.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.448
Where is Brandt?

24:25.198 --> 24:27.698
All right, everyone
in the station listen up.

24:28.092 --> 24:30.193
We got a serious situation.

24:30.195 --> 24:32.195
Our undercover operation went bad.

24:32.197 --> 24:34.330
Officer Brandt is now missing.

24:34.332 --> 24:36.886
Be prepared to jump in as needed.

24:36.888 --> 24:38.921
This case is your case now, too.

24:38.923 --> 24:40.055
Gideon?

24:40.057 --> 24:42.992
We're trying to track
down Officer Brandt.

24:42.994 --> 24:45.928
Unfortunately, the same thing that

24:45.930 --> 24:47.563
made his surveillance equipment

24:47.565 --> 24:50.499
hard for the bad guys to find

24:50.501 --> 24:52.434
is making it hard for us to find him.

24:52.436 --> 24:54.436
We are working the problem

24:54.438 --> 24:57.573
and I promise you we won't
stop until Brandt is safe.

24:57.575 --> 24:59.175
If you're the praying kind,

24:59.177 --> 25:01.810
now's the time to put in a good
word for your fellow officer.

25:01.812 --> 25:02.945
While you're at it,

25:02.947 --> 25:06.182
pray for a better G.S.M.
localization protocol.

25:11.522 --> 25:12.821
Gideon.

25:13.824 --> 25:15.024
Hmm? Yeah, I know.

25:15.026 --> 25:16.091
Do you?

25:17.595 --> 25:19.328
What? Yeah.

25:19.330 --> 25:20.896
Yes, Murphy, I understand.

25:20.898 --> 25:22.998
If, uh...

25:23.000 --> 25:25.668
if we don't find Brandt, then, um...

25:25.670 --> 25:27.203
whatever happens is on me.

25:27.205 --> 25:28.771
No.

25:28.773 --> 25:30.673
See, that's not how this works.

25:30.675 --> 25:33.142
I'm the lead on this,
so just listen to me.

25:33.144 --> 25:35.477
Do you remember how you felt
when your friend Sully died

25:35.479 --> 25:36.478
in that liquor store?

25:36.480 --> 25:38.981
Right before you came to us?

25:38.983 --> 25:42.318
Every cop in the 13th
District is a Sully to me.

25:42.320 --> 25:43.852
Even the ones I don't even like.

25:43.854 --> 25:46.088
You're here,

25:46.090 --> 25:47.590
you bleed blue.

25:47.592 --> 25:49.258
Period.

25:49.260 --> 25:51.927
So this isn't just on you.

25:51.929 --> 25:54.763
It's on us.

25:54.765 --> 25:56.365
We'll find him together.

25:56.367 --> 25:57.533
Okay?

26:01.472 --> 26:04.240
Now, gentlemen...

26:04.242 --> 26:09.712
...we are gonna have a real
talk about my missing guns.

26:09.714 --> 26:10.846
Okay?

26:10.848 --> 26:13.849
Hunter, come on, man.

26:13.851 --> 26:15.961
You... I... you got to believe me. When...

26:15.963 --> 26:17.602
You got to believe me.

26:17.604 --> 26:18.969
That's the thing, Tico,

26:18.971 --> 26:20.389
I don't believe you.

26:20.391 --> 26:22.057
So what was that story

26:22.059 --> 26:24.526
that you were going around town,
talking about the big score?

26:24.528 --> 26:26.395
I-I was just building up the business.

26:26.397 --> 26:28.497
I... it was just talk, you
know, people want a winner.

26:28.499 --> 26:31.433
Yeah. I was, I was exuding winner.

26:31.435 --> 26:34.638
You fake it till you make it, right?
Who hasn't faked it?

26:34.640 --> 26:37.742
Tico's marketing skills could
use some help, you know.

26:37.744 --> 26:39.647
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

26:39.649 --> 26:40.648
Just cool off.

26:40.650 --> 26:42.583
You know, we could figure this out.

26:42.585 --> 26:44.252
Really? How so?

26:44.254 --> 26:46.087
I'll help you find out what happened.

26:46.089 --> 26:48.589
Well, actually, you already did.

26:51.861 --> 26:53.227
Tico, listen to me.

26:53.229 --> 26:55.830
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

26:55.832 --> 26:58.733
And I want you to answer me honestly.

26:58.735 --> 27:00.501
You're gonna tell me where my guns are.

27:00.503 --> 27:01.969
He doesn't know anything!

27:01.971 --> 27:03.604
How you like your fingers, Tico?

27:03.606 --> 27:05.506
You think you need all of them? Okay.

27:08.678 --> 27:10.077
- Okay, okay.
- That's one, that's one.

27:10.079 --> 27:11.913
Please stop. Please stop.

27:11.915 --> 27:13.981
No, you didn't, Tico.
Tell him you didn't do it.

27:13.983 --> 27:16.751
They're at my place, man.

27:16.753 --> 27:17.919
- They're at your place?
- Yeah.

27:17.921 --> 27:19.220
Okay.

27:19.222 --> 27:20.188
Now, Tico,

27:20.190 --> 27:22.223
I just have one more question for you.

27:22.225 --> 27:23.691
How'd you know where I had 'em?

27:29.666 --> 27:31.866
Come on. Come on!

27:31.868 --> 27:33.367
With Brandt stationary,

27:33.369 --> 27:36.137
it should be easier to
triangulate his position.

27:36.139 --> 27:39.207
Yeah, in theory, maybe, but
I don't control the location

27:39.209 --> 27:40.908
of the cell phone towers.

27:40.910 --> 27:43.110
In order to get a good
lock on him, we need three.

27:43.112 --> 27:44.245
We have two.

27:45.338 --> 27:47.672
Location-wise, that leaves us with this.

27:48.957 --> 27:51.057
Well, that's not too far from here.

27:51.059 --> 27:52.325
Yeah, the area's too big.

27:52.327 --> 27:54.060
There's no way we can
knock on all those doors.

27:54.062 --> 27:55.862
Well, then, we have to
be able to narrow it down.

27:55.864 --> 27:57.730
No, not without more data.

27:57.732 --> 28:01.901
- Gideon, I'm sorry, but I just don't...
- Do not finish that sentence!

28:03.538 --> 28:04.804
We'll find a way.

28:04.806 --> 28:07.807
I just... I j-just...
I got to think a minute.

28:14.683 --> 28:15.748
We need another cell phone tower.

28:15.750 --> 28:17.684
Well, we need... we need
another cell phone tower.

28:17.686 --> 28:18.885
We need a...

28:18.887 --> 28:21.387
We need another cell phone tower.

28:29.397 --> 28:30.630
What are you doing?

28:30.632 --> 28:31.965
We've got to find Brandt.

28:31.967 --> 28:34.634
To do that, I need this radio.

28:35.470 --> 28:37.303
Ready? Let's do it!

28:37.305 --> 28:39.072
All right.

28:43.211 --> 28:44.677
Where you keep the pi boards?

28:44.679 --> 28:46.746
Uh, uh, in the orange case.

28:46.748 --> 28:47.747
What are you building?

28:47.749 --> 28:50.517
It's like a StingRay.

28:50.519 --> 28:52.285
Mimics a cell tower.

28:52.287 --> 28:53.887
I know what a StingRay is.

28:53.889 --> 28:56.055
Well, then stop asking
questions and watch the road.

28:56.057 --> 28:57.857
Well, you're gonna need
a bigger power supply,

28:57.859 --> 28:59.125
that's what I'm saying.

28:59.127 --> 29:00.627
It's on the bottom shelf.

29:00.629 --> 29:03.229
- Ah, jeez. Pete!
- What?

29:03.231 --> 29:06.499
You need serious help with
your organizational skills.

29:06.501 --> 29:09.269
How close are we to being within
range of Brandt's transmitter?

29:09.271 --> 29:11.437
Not close enough.

29:20.982 --> 29:23.082
Okay, okay, just stop, please, please.

29:23.084 --> 29:25.852
Now, Tico,

29:25.854 --> 29:28.988
I'm getting real tired of this.

29:28.990 --> 29:30.557
It was him.

29:30.559 --> 29:31.624
He told me.

29:31.626 --> 29:33.393
He's lying.

29:33.395 --> 29:35.295
- What did he tell you?
- He's lying.

29:35.297 --> 29:36.329
Shut up.

29:36.331 --> 29:38.598
Tico, what did he tell you?

29:40.268 --> 29:41.234
Places.

29:41.236 --> 29:43.102
Places. What-what places?

29:43.104 --> 29:45.572
Places, uh, where-where you see...

29:45.574 --> 29:46.973
Tico...

29:46.975 --> 29:49.242
Hey, I said keep your mouth shut.

29:49.244 --> 29:50.977
Tico?

29:50.979 --> 29:53.246
How does this son of a
bitch know anything about me?

29:53.248 --> 29:56.249
They got surveillance, man.

29:59.354 --> 30:02.055
He's a...

30:07.288 --> 30:08.620
He's a what?

30:12.234 --> 30:14.067
He's a cop, man!

30:14.069 --> 30:15.768
He's a cop.

30:32.988 --> 30:34.454
A cop?

30:36.224 --> 30:37.290
He's scared.

30:37.292 --> 30:38.992
What do you think he's gonna say?

30:38.994 --> 30:40.260
Think about it.

30:40.262 --> 30:41.494
It's the truth, man.

30:41.496 --> 30:43.663
I-I don't want to lie anymore.

30:43.665 --> 30:45.098
They booked me.

30:45.100 --> 30:49.476
He said that if I cooperated,
then they would drop charges.

30:49.478 --> 30:52.468
Tico, it's okay.

30:52.470 --> 30:55.605
Now I just got one
more question for you.

30:55.877 --> 30:57.110
You have my guns, right?

30:57.112 --> 30:58.211
They're at your place?

30:58.213 --> 31:00.146
- Yeah.
- Okay. All of them?

31:00.148 --> 31:02.849
- Every single one, every single one.
- Good. That's good.

31:09.282 --> 31:12.851
I got to tell you, man, for a cop

31:12.853 --> 31:17.322
to walk in here without
wearing a wire...

31:17.324 --> 31:20.492
Buddy, you are either incredibly brave,

31:20.494 --> 31:21.726
or incredibly stupid.

31:21.728 --> 31:24.229
What are you doing? He's a cop.

31:24.231 --> 31:25.730
We need to get ghost like now.

31:25.732 --> 31:27.595
- I got this.
- He's right.

31:27.597 --> 31:29.930
Don't make this any worse than it is.

31:29.932 --> 31:31.132
You know what we're gonna do?

31:31.134 --> 31:34.502
You're gonna tell me everything

31:34.504 --> 31:36.270
that the cops know about me.

31:36.272 --> 31:38.839
And we're gonna start at the beginning,

31:38.841 --> 31:42.643
and please keep in mind what
happens to people who lie to me.

31:44.947 --> 31:48.616
Okay. You listening?

31:48.618 --> 31:50.251
Yeah.

31:50.253 --> 31:53.687
I found out about you

31:53.689 --> 31:57.057
from my partner, Ryder.

31:57.059 --> 32:00.694
Hank Ryder. You remember that name?

32:00.696 --> 32:02.930
Doesn't ring a bell.

32:02.932 --> 32:04.632
You sure?

32:04.634 --> 32:07.168
Hank Ryder.

32:07.170 --> 32:09.003
That name should mean something to you.

32:09.005 --> 32:10.638
Okay, I've never heard of it,

32:10.640 --> 32:12.173
so here's what we're
gonna do. Give me the bat.

32:12.175 --> 32:14.808
You're gonna start telling me

32:14.810 --> 32:19.380
something that I actually want to hear.

32:19.901 --> 32:22.001
You understand?

32:33.996 --> 32:36.397
Ada, getting this?

32:36.399 --> 32:38.265
Yeah, I see you. You
got 23 seconds to spare.

32:38.267 --> 32:39.900
So, when the data comes in,

32:39.902 --> 32:42.137
we should be able to
pinpoint his location.

32:42.139 --> 32:42.727
I'm on it.

32:42.729 --> 32:44.838
All right. Now, ignore
the steady transmissions.

32:44.840 --> 32:46.540
Just look for the blip.

32:46.542 --> 32:48.709
Yeah, Gideon, I
know. I've got this.

32:53.115 --> 32:55.082
I got him! I got him. Okay.

32:55.084 --> 32:56.473
Okay, he looks like he's on
the corner of Elwood and Eighth.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.176
It looks like an old warehouse.

32:58.178 --> 33:01.755
All right, everybody, move in. Guns out.

33:01.757 --> 33:03.224
Be careful.

33:03.227 --> 33:04.992
I repeat, be careful.

33:04.994 --> 33:06.961
1309 en route.

33:06.963 --> 33:08.862
Let's go get our boy.

33:08.864 --> 33:11.398
Come on!

33:26.349 --> 33:28.716
Conrad, we're at the scene.

33:28.718 --> 33:29.984
What's the situation?

33:29.986 --> 33:31.952
All right, folks,
here's what we know.

33:31.954 --> 33:33.754
Brandt's been made.

33:33.756 --> 33:34.770
He's stalling.

33:34.773 --> 33:37.591
Keeps talking about an old partner.

33:37.593 --> 33:38.737
Hank Ryder.

33:38.740 --> 33:40.728
He can't stall forever.
We got to get in there now.

33:40.730 --> 33:42.563
I think the loading
dock is our best bet.

33:42.565 --> 33:43.565
I'll grab a flashbang,

33:43.568 --> 33:44.985
I'll clear the lot, you take the corner.

33:44.987 --> 33:46.198
- Let's go.
- Wait.

33:46.201 --> 33:48.501
That name, Hank Ryder.

33:48.504 --> 33:50.704
Brandt is not just stalling.

33:50.706 --> 33:52.906
He's talking to us, to me.

33:52.908 --> 33:54.642
When Brandt and I were rookies,

33:54.644 --> 33:56.804
there was a burglary at Ryder Market.

33:56.807 --> 33:59.526
Meth head named Hank holed
up inside with a shotgun.

33:59.528 --> 34:01.494
Shot clear through the
rolling doors out front.

34:01.496 --> 34:04.764
The loading dock, it's
the same kind of door.

34:04.766 --> 34:06.466
Brandt's telling us that
we can't go through it.

34:06.468 --> 34:07.634
We need to find another way.

34:07.636 --> 34:09.369
The guy is being tortured.

34:09.371 --> 34:11.603
We start poking around,
we're gonna get made.

34:11.606 --> 34:13.973
Gideon, we need another entry point.

34:16.210 --> 34:19.379
Way ahead of you. Go!

34:22.335 --> 34:24.184
Don't be stupid.

34:24.186 --> 34:26.518
Just call the 13th District,

34:26.521 --> 34:27.954
and tell them you want to make a deal.

34:27.956 --> 34:31.024
Hell, with all of Gideon Reeves' money,

34:31.025 --> 34:32.958
you could make out like a bandit.

34:32.960 --> 34:35.007
Shut up.

34:35.011 --> 34:37.496
God, I'm so tired of hearing your mouth.

34:37.498 --> 34:38.697
Are you crazy?

34:38.699 --> 34:41.868
We cannot just kill a cop.

34:41.870 --> 34:44.370
Why the hell not?

34:44.371 --> 34:46.239
Because we don't
want that type of heat.

34:46.241 --> 34:48.308
We already got that kind of heat.

34:48.310 --> 34:50.210
What, do you think they're
gonna give you a pass

34:50.212 --> 34:52.978
after you kidnapped him
and tied him to a chair?

34:52.981 --> 34:56.049
Come on, man, you heard
him. We could make a deal.

34:56.051 --> 34:58.051
There's no deal.

34:58.053 --> 34:59.786
We got a body on the ground.

34:59.788 --> 35:02.255
The cop's got to go.

35:11.032 --> 35:12.699
I got your entry point.

35:36.791 --> 35:39.525
No suspects identified.

35:39.527 --> 35:42.528
Gideon, we could use a little help here.

35:46.768 --> 35:49.335
He's in the next room to
your right, Murphy, hurry.

35:49.337 --> 35:50.803
They're gonna kill him.

35:54.913 --> 35:58.305
Be smart, Hunter. I'm
no use to you dead.

35:58.308 --> 36:01.142
You keep me alive, you got leverage.

36:01.144 --> 36:03.878
I think you watch too many movies.

36:17.594 --> 36:20.695
Police! Drop your weapon! On the floor!

36:22.043 --> 36:23.476
Drop it.

36:32.075 --> 36:34.208
- You all right? You good?
- Yeah.

36:45.889 --> 36:47.421
Find the necklace?

36:50.669 --> 36:52.569
I think you should get one of these.

36:53.906 --> 36:56.273
Nice work.

37:01.347 --> 37:03.614
Morning, everybody.

37:03.616 --> 37:05.148
Uh, before we get our day started,

37:05.150 --> 37:07.581
I would just like to say a few words.

37:07.584 --> 37:11.586
It's no secret that I
run a technology empire.

37:11.589 --> 37:14.391
And because I spend so much of my time

37:14.393 --> 37:17.261
in the company of robots and computers

37:17.263 --> 37:19.229
and nanotech devices,

37:19.231 --> 37:23.467
people sometimes think that I
don't care much about humans.

37:23.469 --> 37:25.702
But here's the thing.

37:25.704 --> 37:30.107
My company started with
manned space flight.

37:30.109 --> 37:33.443
And when you put a rocket into space,

37:33.445 --> 37:36.547
it's not about going as far
or as fast as you can go.

37:36.549 --> 37:38.215
That's not hard.

37:38.217 --> 37:42.920
What's hard is making
sure everybody comes home.

37:42.922 --> 37:46.071
Yesterday was not a
victory for technology.

37:46.074 --> 37:48.558
Was the technology excellent?

37:48.561 --> 37:50.227
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was.

37:50.229 --> 37:54.331
We are literally the only police
department in the entire world

37:54.333 --> 37:57.034
with a $2 million jacket
hanging in our closet.

37:58.037 --> 37:59.269
Right?

37:59.271 --> 38:01.538
But the real victory
belongs to all of you.

38:03.409 --> 38:05.809
Ada did not let one
kilobyte pass her desk

38:05.811 --> 38:08.412
without a fight.

38:08.414 --> 38:10.614
Conrad, you helped us
cut through the noise,

38:10.616 --> 38:12.883
and listen to what really mattered.

38:12.885 --> 38:15.819
Detective Murphy,

38:15.821 --> 38:18.455
between those transmissions,
when our screen went dark,

38:18.457 --> 38:21.558
you somehow managed to
see what nobody else could.

38:23.862 --> 38:25.696
And Officer Brandt,

38:25.698 --> 38:28.065
a lesser man would have buckled.

38:28.067 --> 38:30.267
And we are glad you're home.

38:33.839 --> 38:36.807
Glad to be home, boss.

38:42.581 --> 38:45.849
Just so you know, you still
cannot keep the jacket.

38:55.828 --> 38:57.761
Hey, uh, sir?

38:57.763 --> 38:58.762
Yeah?

38:58.764 --> 39:00.397
I read your report.

39:00.399 --> 39:01.965
I need to make some changes.

39:01.967 --> 39:03.700
Changes?

39:03.702 --> 39:05.318
We went through it, you signed off.

39:05.321 --> 39:08.038
Yeah, I know, but, um,
I made some mistakes,

39:08.040 --> 39:10.440
uh, remembered some stuff.

39:13.912 --> 39:15.379
Come with me.

39:18.484 --> 39:21.184
Did someone pressure
you to change your story?

39:21.186 --> 39:22.886
No, no. It's nothing like that.

39:22.888 --> 39:25.756
Look, I know that this
has been very hard for you,

39:25.758 --> 39:27.357
but right now I just need the truth.

39:27.359 --> 39:31.194
Well, the truth is, it
wasn't Gideon's fault...

39:31.196 --> 39:33.363
or his technology.

39:33.365 --> 39:36.700
Are you telling me the tech

39:36.702 --> 39:38.835
had nothing to do with you getting hurt?

39:40.406 --> 39:42.105
It was all you?

39:42.107 --> 39:45.609
Yeah. I mean, I'm a rookie.

39:45.611 --> 39:47.544
I'd never been in a
situation like that before,

39:47.546 --> 39:48.979
and I got rattled.

39:54.153 --> 39:56.312
Get this back to me when you're ready.

40:01.859 --> 40:07.563
Scott, what are you really
doing here at the 13th?

40:07.566 --> 40:08.999
My job.

40:09.001 --> 40:11.334
Since when is it the ASA's
job to railroad a rookie

40:11.336 --> 40:13.303
into serving a political agenda?

40:15.240 --> 40:16.506
I'm gonna let that one slide.

40:16.508 --> 40:19.815
Just level with me. Is this about us?

40:19.818 --> 40:21.151
The mayor asked me to come here.

40:21.154 --> 40:22.386
I know.

40:22.389 --> 40:24.256
Okay, but just because
you're doing your job

40:24.259 --> 40:26.192
doesn't mean that you're
doing the right thing.

40:27.252 --> 40:30.187
What's so right about a
smooth-talking rich guy

40:30.189 --> 40:31.822
who's patting himself on the back

40:31.824 --> 40:33.390
for almost getting a cop killed?

40:33.393 --> 40:35.058
It's not like that.

40:35.060 --> 40:36.560
He's helping cops do their jobs.

40:36.562 --> 40:39.029
By breaking every law
they're supposed to enforce?

40:39.031 --> 40:42.699
Right now there are lawsuits being filed

40:42.701 --> 40:44.255
by people who are upset

40:44.258 --> 40:46.536
the drones are infringing
on their privacy,

40:46.538 --> 40:49.606
or that the APB app doesn't
serve everybody equally.

40:49.608 --> 40:52.227
And God knows how many cases
are gonna get thrown out

40:52.230 --> 40:53.630
because he cannot be bothered

40:53.633 --> 40:55.174
to follow the rules like the rest of us.

40:55.176 --> 40:57.981
He expects everybody to
bow down to his greatness.

40:57.983 --> 40:59.950
Well, I'm sorry. I'm not gonna do that.

40:59.952 --> 41:03.086
You do whatever it is you need to do.

41:03.088 --> 41:04.955
But I'm gonna warn you.

41:04.957 --> 41:09.025
Aside from our son and my mother,

41:09.027 --> 41:14.364
there's nothing that I care more
about than the 13th District.

41:14.366 --> 41:16.666
So if you go after Gideon Reeves,

41:16.668 --> 41:18.802
you're going after me, too.
