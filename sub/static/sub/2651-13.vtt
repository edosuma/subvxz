00:05.060 --> 00:08.292
As great as it is bringing
a baby home from the hospital,

00:08.381 --> 00:11.499
there's one sound you absolutely
dread waking up to.

00:11.621 --> 00:15.375
¿ Te acuerdas, Sonia?

00:15.461 --> 00:16.975
Relatives.

00:17.100 --> 00:19.855
Te ves-Te ves divina en esta foto.

00:19.940 --> 00:22.853
I really never saw
these wedding pictures, Mamá.

00:22.940 --> 00:25.455
How handsome and young
Papá looks.

00:25.541 --> 00:28.339
Ay, it makes me sad.

00:28.420 --> 00:29.934
Ay, I know that you miss him.

00:30.060 --> 00:31.541
No. Look at my ass.

00:31.620 --> 00:33.901
There are two things in that
picture I don't have anymore.

00:33.980 --> 00:36.974
Ay, Mamá, qué loca.
Sonia, can I help you?

00:37.061 --> 00:38.892
No, no, she's fine.
It keeps her busy.

00:38.980 --> 00:42.372
We need more corn. Gloria, where's your garden?
I will harvest some.

00:42.461 --> 00:45.453
They don't live that way, honey. Gloria,
give me the keys. We'll go to the market.

00:45.541 --> 00:47.657
Hey, you're all awake.
I didn't hear you.

00:47.741 --> 00:49.937
Oh, look at
my two handsome men.

00:50.020 --> 00:52.489
Miniño, my little
Fulgencio Umberto.

00:52.580 --> 00:54.095
You know, about the name,
we're not entirely sure-

00:54.181 --> 00:57.380
Sonia, vámonos.
Good-bye, Fulgencio.

00:57.462 --> 00:59.532
Say good-bye to Fulgencio.

00:59.621 --> 01:01.932
- Bye-bye, Fulgencio.
- His name is Joe.

01:02.021 --> 01:04.093
You tell her
that we're not naming him...

01:04.221 --> 01:07.021
after her dead husband
or his father before him.

01:07.181 --> 01:08.821
His name was-
Please don't say it again.

01:08.902 --> 01:12.212
Jay, I cannot go
against my mother's will.

01:12.301 --> 01:15.295
But she likes you.
Maybe if you convince her-

01:15.381 --> 01:19.136
"Fuljencio" Umberto-
The initials are F.U. Pritchett.

01:19.222 --> 01:21.532
Which is exactly
the way it feels right now.

01:34.222 --> 01:36.782
Is there some kind
of dress code for godparents?

01:36.862 --> 01:39.093
You're not wearing a fedora, Phil.
Can you pick up the dry cleaning?

01:39.182 --> 01:42.094
That
sounds like an offer I can't refuse.

01:42.182 --> 01:43.502
Yeah, we're not doing that.

01:43.581 --> 01:46.142
So I got delayed picking up
Lily from dance class.

01:46.261 --> 01:48.902
Now Gloria's got me running around doing
a thousand things for the christening.

01:48.981 --> 01:50.496
Son of a bitch.

01:50.581 --> 01:52.699
It's not that bad, really.
I'm just-I'm venting.

01:52.782 --> 01:54.295
I couldn't believe it.

01:54.381 --> 01:55.815
Somebody's balloons
were blocking my billboard.

01:55.902 --> 01:58.133
Philboard. My Philboard.

01:58.222 --> 02:00.497
Can we wear the same outfits
at Crispin's party...

02:00.581 --> 02:02.062
that we're wearing
to the baptism?

02:02.142 --> 02:03.815
Oh, you know what? I don't know.

02:03.902 --> 02:05.176
Because you wanna be subdued
at church...

02:05.262 --> 02:06.411
and then fabulous at night.

02:06.502 --> 02:07.856
You know who would
make a fortune?

02:07.941 --> 02:09.854
The designer who comes up with
the little black dress for men.

02:09.981 --> 02:12.212
Mmm.
I'm bored.

02:12.302 --> 02:13.530
I know, sweetie,
but daddies are talking...

02:13.622 --> 02:14.850
about what we're
gonna wear tonight,

02:14.941 --> 02:16.581
and that's
a difficult conversation.

02:16.701 --> 02:18.534
Cry me a river. Lily.

02:18.622 --> 02:22.058
I-I'm not loving this attitude.
You seem a little mean.

02:22.142 --> 02:25.179
Sorry. Should I call you
a wahmbulance?

02:26.301 --> 02:29.339
Oh, my gosh. She has been
so snarky lately.

02:29.421 --> 02:30.617
I know. I've actually
been getting nervous...

02:30.701 --> 02:31.976
when we're making her
late for something.

02:32.101 --> 02:33.331
Because of what she said
the other day?

02:33.462 --> 02:35.181
"Today, ladies."
Hurtful.

02:35.261 --> 02:37.538
You know,
she hears us doing it.

02:37.622 --> 02:40.933
So we-we should try
and be less negative.

02:41.062 --> 02:43.018
Model some better behavior.
Yeah.

02:43.101 --> 02:44.535
Well, you know, if it's
a model she needs,

02:44.661 --> 02:46.732
she's come to the right place.
Oh, boy.

02:46.821 --> 02:48.700
Hmm.

02:48.782 --> 02:51.536
I wish Lily was in here, so she
could hear me not comment on that.

02:51.662 --> 02:52.732
Hmm?

02:52.822 --> 02:54.177
I get it.
You're modeling.

02:54.262 --> 02:56.299
Hey, it's Phil Dunphy again.

02:56.382 --> 02:58.738
I-I got cut off
by your machine.

02:58.822 --> 03:00.620
I'm, uh, not sure
where I left off there,

03:00.702 --> 03:01.898
but I'll attempt to be brief,

03:01.982 --> 03:04.781
as I do appreciate
when people do the same for me.

03:04.862 --> 03:07.583
Anyhoo, uh, your balloons
are co-

03:07.662 --> 03:08.732
Damn it!

03:08.822 --> 03:10.495
Is anyone home? Mom!

03:10.583 --> 03:12.380
- I need her first. Mom!
- She's out.

03:12.463 --> 03:14.136
Why is she always gone
when we need an adult?

03:14.223 --> 03:15.178
I can help.

03:15.303 --> 03:16.783
What's with the cage?
Science project.

03:16.822 --> 03:18.381
Mom, where are you?
Out.

03:18.463 --> 03:19.658
- It's just the three of us.
- Four.

03:19.743 --> 03:21.256
- I need her.
- Rats!

03:21.343 --> 03:22.458
I know, right?

03:22.542 --> 03:24.063
Guys, I'm right here.
What do you need?

03:24.183 --> 03:25.617
It's okay. We're good.
Never mind.

03:25.702 --> 03:27.023
No. No, no, no, no.

03:27.102 --> 03:28.664
Family meeting. Everybody
grab some 'za.

03:28.783 --> 03:30.614
We're gonna talk about this.

03:31.982 --> 03:34.623
Listen, I know you guys
like to go to Mom...

03:34.702 --> 03:36.456
because she's Mr. Tough
Guy problem solver.

03:36.583 --> 03:37.778
She gets results.

03:37.862 --> 03:40.013
Yeah, she does.
She does. You're right.

03:40.102 --> 03:42.503
Like the last time we got pizza
from our favorite place here.

03:42.542 --> 03:44.023
Remember that?
We got shortchanged,

03:44.102 --> 03:46.095
she cursed a blue streak
and got our money back.

03:46.183 --> 03:47.935
How's that pizza, by the way?

03:48.023 --> 03:48.979
Pretty good.
It's okay.

03:49.063 --> 03:51.498
Liars! It's garbage.

03:51.583 --> 03:54.223
That's not Scardino's.
It's Scandoni's.

03:54.302 --> 03:56.659
You know why? 'Cause
your mom's little blow-up...

03:56.743 --> 04:01.420
got us banned from Scardino's
for life.

04:01.503 --> 04:03.463
So maybe your mom's way
isn't always the best way.

04:03.542 --> 04:06.011
Now why don't you guys
tell me what's going on?

04:06.102 --> 04:08.333
I'm having a '60s-themed
birthday party next week.

04:08.422 --> 04:10.857
Hippies, bell-bottoms,
tie-dye.

04:10.942 --> 04:14.936
Karen Sullivan heard about it, and
decided to have the same party-tonight.

04:15.023 --> 04:16.456
Not groovy.

04:16.583 --> 04:18.302
I accidentally
called my teacher "Mommy."

04:18.382 --> 04:21.738
My "friend" Reuben went around
and told everyone.

04:21.822 --> 04:24.895
Oh, hey, Reuben, do you remember
that class field trip to the zoo...

04:24.982 --> 04:27.578
when the zebra rushed the fence
and you peed your pants?

04:27.662 --> 04:30.497
I didn't tell anyone,
not even on the bus ride home...

04:30.583 --> 04:32.016
when he had to
sit next to Mom-

04:32.102 --> 04:33.934
Miss Bockman! Damn it!

04:34.023 --> 04:35.502
Our neighbor's out of town,

04:35.583 --> 04:37.943
and she's paying me to move her
car on street cleaning days.

04:38.023 --> 04:39.624
Now I would just
park it in her driveway,

04:39.703 --> 04:42.013
but she already has a camper
and a cord of wood there.

04:42.102 --> 04:43.663
Pretty sure she's a lesbian.

04:43.743 --> 04:45.815
Anyway, easy money, right?

04:45.983 --> 04:47.781
Oh, my God.
I can't see anything!

04:47.944 --> 04:50.334
Hard starboard!
What does that even mean?

04:50.423 --> 04:53.064
How much longer
do I have to block people?

04:53.144 --> 04:54.623
I'm late for the airport.

04:54.743 --> 04:56.264
Dylan, you are being
no help right now!

04:56.303 --> 04:58.341
Sorry, but I'm already
in trouble with dispatch...

04:58.423 --> 05:00.620
for drinking
all those little waters.

05:00.704 --> 05:02.582
Drive! Do it now!

05:05.063 --> 05:08.135
How do I tell her I snapped a
branch on her beloved lemon tree?

05:08.224 --> 05:11.853
I mean, she boils the leaves to add
a scent to her own work boot oil.

05:11.944 --> 05:14.663
Did I mention she plays
in two softball leagues?

05:14.743 --> 05:17.053
What are you guys gonna do? You
gonna have your mom go around...

05:17.183 --> 05:19.937
and yell at all these people
and burn a bunch of bridges,

05:20.063 --> 05:22.533
or are you gonna talk
to your Reubens,

05:22.623 --> 05:26.538
your Karens, your lemon lady?

05:26.623 --> 05:30.300
Tell 'em how you feel,
appeal to their human side.

05:30.384 --> 05:32.978
The choice
is pretty simple, huh?

05:34.663 --> 05:36.575
So she's out all day?

05:36.743 --> 05:39.464
I'll try her cell. It's off. I
texted her while Dad was talking.

05:42.663 --> 05:44.495
Pilar, I brought you a coffee.
Oh.

05:44.584 --> 05:46.142
I put a little
something extra in it.

05:46.224 --> 05:48.784
Jay, you devil.

05:48.863 --> 05:52.096
Hey, by the way, look-

05:52.183 --> 05:54.334
It's beautiful, no?

05:54.423 --> 05:57.098
It's the dressing gown
for Fulgencio's christening.

05:57.224 --> 05:59.454
All the man
in our family wear this.

05:59.543 --> 06:01.024
What's one more son in a dress?

06:01.144 --> 06:03.704
Oh, tradition.
It's so important.

06:03.784 --> 06:07.743
I have a gift in here
for little Fulgencio...

06:07.824 --> 06:10.498
that has been in my family
for three generations.

06:10.584 --> 06:12.382
You know, about
this naming thing-

06:12.464 --> 06:16.014
In America, it's not real common
to hear the name "Fuljencio."

06:16.103 --> 06:17.423
It's "Ful-hen-cio."

06:17.503 --> 06:18.904
- Hen?
- Hen.

06:18.983 --> 06:21.543
I don't need to practice it,
'cause I can't name my son that.

06:21.663 --> 06:23.781
I'm just being honest with you.

06:23.863 --> 06:25.776
No. No, no, no, no,
that's good.

06:25.863 --> 06:27.856
That's good. I should be more
honest with you sometimes.

06:27.944 --> 06:29.173
Well, we know each other
a few years.

06:29.303 --> 06:30.863
I don't like you, Jay.
Huh?

06:30.944 --> 06:33.856
Nah. We can act like everything
is fine for the family,

06:33.944 --> 06:35.697
but, you know,
I have never liked you.

06:35.784 --> 06:39.778
The way you take whatever
looks good to you, you know-

06:39.864 --> 06:42.504
like my daughter or the
last piece of meat.

06:42.585 --> 06:43.734
Whoa.

06:43.825 --> 06:45.864
You're always too busy
to pick me up at the airport.

06:45.945 --> 06:48.698
You send a total stranger
with a cardboard sign.

06:48.785 --> 06:49.979
Hey, Grandma.
Hey.

06:50.065 --> 06:51.783
Hey, buddy.
Get over here.

06:51.905 --> 06:53.816
I sure do love the
cross you got me.

06:53.905 --> 06:55.384
But do I have to wear it today?

06:55.465 --> 06:57.501
It's kinda hard
to close my shirt over it.

06:57.585 --> 07:00.862
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You do
whatever you want, padrecito.

07:00.945 --> 07:02.345
I know that's the way
in this house.

07:02.385 --> 07:06.015
But if you wear it,
ooh, you'll make me proud.

07:06.104 --> 07:08.301
It's been in my family
for five generations.

07:08.385 --> 07:10.342
Okay.
I'll walk you out, buddy.

07:11.225 --> 07:12.784
Is anything in her family new?

07:14.465 --> 07:16.422
Just you.

07:20.544 --> 07:23.537
Okay. Excuse me. Sorry.

07:23.624 --> 07:25.980
All right. Here we've got
the deli platter,

07:26.104 --> 07:27.823
and there's more in my car.

07:28.785 --> 07:30.583
But those are not
from Rumpernook's.

07:30.664 --> 07:32.383
No, because
the cheese at Rump-

07:32.465 --> 07:34.023
I don't go there anymore.

07:34.104 --> 07:35.539
I'm going to do the laundry.

07:35.624 --> 07:38.265
Okay, Sonia.
I love you so much.

07:38.345 --> 07:41.542
- Wow. Pretty cozy with the new housekeeper, huh?
- She's my sister.

07:41.624 --> 07:44.503
Wow. Pretty weird
with your sister.

07:44.624 --> 07:47.345
She likes to keep busy.
But I feel bad for her.

07:47.424 --> 07:49.337
I have so much,
and she has nothing.

07:49.424 --> 07:51.337
Okay. Well, people
make their own choices.

07:51.465 --> 07:54.537
- It's not like you're responsible.
- No, no.

07:54.624 --> 07:56.104
Maybe just a little bit.

07:56.184 --> 07:59.496
I was older, and I had
opportunities to travel,

07:59.585 --> 08:01.018
and I took them.

08:01.104 --> 08:04.222
- Well, it didn't prevent her from going anywhere.
- No, no.

08:04.304 --> 08:06.376
Maybe just one time.

08:06.465 --> 08:10.378
There was a letter that arrived from
America about a job opportunity.

08:10.465 --> 08:12.616
And it was only for one person,

08:12.705 --> 08:14.219
and I went.

08:14.304 --> 08:16.580
But it's not like the envelope
was addressed to her,

08:16.664 --> 08:18.496
and you opened it and-

08:18.585 --> 08:20.099
You're evil.

08:20.184 --> 08:21.938
I had to get out
of there, Claire.

08:22.025 --> 08:25.734
You just strapped on those high heels and
walked right over her back, didn't you?

08:25.825 --> 08:27.623
Maybe a little bit.

08:27.705 --> 08:29.741
Where is the river?

08:32.145 --> 08:35.264
- Hey, boys!
- Crispin.

08:35.385 --> 08:37.980
Shouldn't you be preparing for
your annual party of the century?

08:38.066 --> 08:40.261
It's done, and it's perfect. In my
mind, I'm already into next year's.

08:40.346 --> 08:42.576
I'm here with Brett. I don't know
if you've seen his new look,

08:42.666 --> 08:44.418
but you are going to have
a heart attack and die.

08:44.546 --> 08:46.264
No one's dying.
It's just an expression.

08:46.385 --> 08:48.980
Yeah.
Hey, handsome.

08:49.105 --> 08:51.666
Yep, I did it. Pulled the
trigger and got a perm.

08:51.745 --> 08:53.145
You sure did.

08:53.226 --> 08:54.979
Did it myself,
right in the kitchen.

08:55.066 --> 08:58.024
You don't need to spend a
million to look like a million.

08:58.105 --> 09:01.782
Uh, you know, my coffee's
probably ready, so-

09:01.905 --> 09:03.259
Bye.

09:03.346 --> 09:05.417
Okay, that's like
a Chia Pet, right?

09:05.505 --> 09:07.543
Maybe a drag production
of Annie?

09:07.666 --> 09:10.101
Oh, actually, Lily, I think
Uncle Crispin's forgetting...

09:10.186 --> 09:13.384
that Brett has feelings and we
need to try and not hurt them, so-

09:13.505 --> 09:15.303
Yes, and maybe we
should remind Uncle Crispin...

09:15.426 --> 09:18.259
that when you say nice things to
people, they say nice things back.

09:18.385 --> 09:21.618
Well, consider me reminded.

09:21.706 --> 09:23.902
Gotta run. Yeah, we'll
see you tonight. Bye.

09:23.985 --> 09:25.419
Can't wait. Can't wait.

09:25.546 --> 09:28.140
He's funny. Yes, he is, but
he can also be biting.

09:28.265 --> 09:30.302
He bites people?
Well, with his words,

09:30.385 --> 09:32.187
not with his teeth
like Xander from art class.

09:32.226 --> 09:34.057
We need to
confirm he got his shot.

09:34.145 --> 09:36.945
Yeah. Oh, my God.
Okay, Crispin-

09:37.025 --> 09:39.381
"Too many R.S.V.P.'s.
Have to make cuts to party.

09:39.466 --> 09:41.344
Maybe next time."
Sad face.

09:41.426 --> 09:43.418
Wha-

09:43.505 --> 09:46.942
Because we refuse to abuse, we get
banned from the party of the century?

09:47.025 --> 09:49.221
Does somebody need
a wahmbulance?

09:49.306 --> 09:52.582
No. I do not need
a wahmbulance.

09:53.666 --> 09:57.102
Hey, kids.
How was your day?

09:57.186 --> 09:59.381
I knew the answer
to that question.

09:59.466 --> 10:03.346
I'd had kind of a busy day going
around solving everyone's problems.

10:03.426 --> 10:06.384
I started by going to see
my buddy Stavros the florist.

10:07.745 --> 10:09.499
- Stavros, I assume?
- Yes.

10:09.586 --> 10:11.577
I just wanted to
welcome you to the neighborhood.

10:11.706 --> 10:14.301
Well, thank you. Yeah, I brought
you some sandwiches, by the way.

10:14.385 --> 10:15.865
How good is lamb, huh?

10:15.985 --> 10:16.942
Oh!

10:17.066 --> 10:18.260
Nikos!
Oh! Gotcha.

10:18.385 --> 10:20.183
Oh!

10:20.265 --> 10:21.859
Get back in-

10:21.946 --> 10:24.939
I'm so sorry. Is there
anything I can do for you?

10:25.026 --> 10:28.064
Oh, no. No, I-

10:28.146 --> 10:29.660
Well-

10:29.746 --> 10:31.746
That's when I realized
my kids didn't understand...

10:31.786 --> 10:35.257
the concept of killing with kindness
because they'd never seen it.

10:35.347 --> 10:38.465
So, I decided
I'd prove it to them...

10:38.547 --> 10:41.141
by going on
a hugicidal rampage.

10:41.227 --> 10:44.379
Is that Reuben
rockin' the Potter specs?

10:44.467 --> 10:46.345
Quiddiculous!

10:46.427 --> 10:48.817
Hey, listen, buddy, I heard about
Luke calling his teacher "Mommy."

10:48.906 --> 10:50.659
Epic fail, by the way.

10:50.746 --> 10:52.667
But, you know, since
you're one of the cool kids,

10:52.746 --> 10:55.216
maybe you could get the other
ones to ease off a little?

10:55.307 --> 10:57.775
Cool. Air bump.

10:57.866 --> 11:00.621
Hi, Lee. It's Phil Dunphy from
down the street. We haven't met.

11:00.707 --> 11:02.539
I was actually calling to leave
a message for your wife...

11:02.626 --> 11:05.425
just to say thanks
for hiring my daughter Haley.

11:05.506 --> 11:08.146
Listen, we'd love to have you and the
missus over for a glass of wine,

11:08.227 --> 11:10.741
or, uh, maybe you and I
could go out for a boys' night.

11:10.827 --> 11:11.943
But anyway, if you could-

11:12.026 --> 11:13.506
Damn it!
Oh. Oh.

11:13.626 --> 11:17.018
Hey, Karen Sullivan.
Alex's dad.

11:17.106 --> 11:19.303
Well, look whose teeth
got so nice and straight.

11:21.506 --> 11:22.861
Who wants to go first?

11:24.866 --> 11:27.381
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
One at a time!

11:27.467 --> 11:29.106
You called Miss Cooper a man!

11:29.227 --> 11:31.307
No, I didn't. I got her husband,
Lee, on the machine.

11:31.386 --> 11:33.663
There is no husband!
She's Lee!

11:33.746 --> 11:35.898
Weirdly deep-voiced,
alcoholic, gay Lee Cooper...

11:35.986 --> 11:38.103
who you invited out
for a glass of wine!

11:38.187 --> 11:40.106
Thanks to your little
charm offensive with Karen,

11:40.146 --> 11:42.707
one thing did change about
her party-I'm not invited!

11:42.786 --> 11:44.459
"Quiddiculous"?
"Epic fail"?

11:44.547 --> 11:47.106
Now the whole school is just
laughing at both of us.

11:49.667 --> 11:52.704
Stavros, hey!

11:53.866 --> 11:55.664
Why not?

11:58.587 --> 11:59.622
What?

11:59.707 --> 12:03.462
Change of plans.
This isn't over.

12:03.547 --> 12:05.698
I want you to wear
something beautiful tonight.

12:05.786 --> 12:07.904
So please, choose.

12:08.026 --> 12:11.098
What is this room?
This is the closet.

12:11.227 --> 12:14.583
So all the people of the town, they
leave their nice clothes with you?

12:14.667 --> 12:17.136
No.
These are all my clothes.

12:17.228 --> 12:21.347
But... I do miss
the simple things at home.

12:21.428 --> 12:24.785
So tell me, how-how are
things in the village?

12:24.907 --> 12:28.583
- We had a flood.
- Ay, but it-it wasn't a bad one, right?

12:28.668 --> 12:31.308
- We had a boat.
- Ay, that's great.

12:31.387 --> 12:33.982
We had a boat.

12:34.068 --> 12:36.104
Are you dating anyone?

12:36.188 --> 12:37.827
You remember Antonio Marquez?

12:37.907 --> 12:39.467
Yes, of course.

12:39.588 --> 12:43.661
The most handsome boy in the
school with those beautiful eyes.

12:43.747 --> 12:45.467
His father
with the wooden leg-

12:45.548 --> 12:47.380
He lost it in the flood.

12:48.428 --> 12:51.022
So is it serious?

12:54.267 --> 12:56.179
Don't look at that.
I won't. Trust me.

12:56.267 --> 12:57.827
Please. It's pathetic.

12:57.907 --> 13:00.828
Crispin getting all our friends to text
us the details of his great party.

13:00.867 --> 13:02.301
Such torture, huh?

13:02.387 --> 13:05.381
Oh, catering
by Amelia's. Ow!

13:05.507 --> 13:06.828
Topless valet parkers.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.546
Sting.
Exactly.

13:08.627 --> 13:11.506
No, Sting is at the party.
Mitchell, I wanna be there.

13:11.627 --> 13:14.097
Cam. No, come on. Who are we kidding?
You do too.

13:14.188 --> 13:16.578
Today, ladies!
Okay, right there. That.

13:16.708 --> 13:19.142
That is why we are making this
sacrifice-for our daughter.

13:19.228 --> 13:22.026
No, yeah, you're right. I mean, I'm the
last one who should be complaining...

13:22.107 --> 13:24.747
when, let's face it,
Lily's snarkiness is my doing.

13:24.828 --> 13:26.420
Well, what's done is done.

13:26.507 --> 13:28.943
Let's just
get ready for church.

13:29.027 --> 13:32.544
Yeah, I mean, it's just hard to not feel
guilty, you know, when it's mostly my fault.

13:32.627 --> 13:34.425
I get it. Just don't
beat yourself up.

13:34.507 --> 13:36.659
Hey. Pocket square,
no pocket square?

13:36.747 --> 13:39.819
Really? You're taking zero
of the responsibility, or-

13:39.907 --> 13:42.502
Oh. Were you trying to get
me to take the blame?

13:42.588 --> 13:44.180
Yeah. Maybe just
a little. Uh-huh.

13:44.267 --> 13:46.108
Oh, and deny you
the chance to play the martyr?

13:46.188 --> 13:48.338
Look, Cam, if you're looking
for me to be the bad guy,

13:48.428 --> 13:50.464
you're snarking up
the wrong tree, okay?

13:50.548 --> 13:54.827
You are the one who can't let a single
situation pass without making a comment.

13:57.387 --> 13:59.505
Oh, well, maybe
I'll just start today.

13:59.668 --> 14:02.546
I think it'll make you feel better.
I think I already do.

14:02.627 --> 14:05.825
Right to my face, "I don't like
you." Nobody doesn't like me.

14:05.948 --> 14:08.622
I'm Jay. I'm-I'm salt of the earth.

14:08.708 --> 14:10.188
Why are you inhaling my baby?

14:10.267 --> 14:12.339
Oh, they only smell perfect
like this for a little while.

14:12.429 --> 14:14.340
Yeah. That's the stuff.

14:14.429 --> 14:16.499
From day one, I've treated
this woman like a queen.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.262
I've flown her back and forth.

14:18.349 --> 14:20.227
I've-I've tasted
her native food.

14:20.309 --> 14:23.108
You know what chin tastes like?
'Cause I do.

14:23.189 --> 14:24.941
And now to find out-

14:25.669 --> 14:26.819
What? I'm listening.

14:26.908 --> 14:28.740
You're rubbing yourself
with a baby.

14:28.829 --> 14:30.387
I have seen you
French kiss your dog.

14:30.469 --> 14:32.983
She was taking a treat out of my mouth.
That's a trick.

14:33.069 --> 14:36.186
I am sure you know what I find
funny about this situation.

14:36.268 --> 14:39.579
- What?
- You have an in-law who, no matter what you do,

14:39.709 --> 14:42.349
no matter how hard you try,
you can't win over.

14:42.469 --> 14:43.788
What about it?

14:43.868 --> 14:47.225
Wait. That doesn't sound familiar?

14:47.309 --> 14:49.743
- You're not saying-
- Mm-hmm. Yeah, I am.

14:50.829 --> 14:53.138
Son of a bitch.
I'm Phil.

14:56.309 --> 14:59.507
Hey, Pilar, it's awfully cold. Here.
Why don't you take my jacket?

14:59.589 --> 15:01.307
Sure, yeah.
Make me the rude one.

15:01.388 --> 15:04.780
Look, I'm sorry that I pointed out that
we're both to blame here, all right?

15:04.868 --> 15:07.589
But let's not turn this lovely
event into a competition.

15:07.709 --> 15:11.099
Here you go, sweetie. Oh, you know what? You're right.
I shouldn't be picking at you.

15:11.189 --> 15:12.542
But don't forget
to light your candle.

15:12.628 --> 15:14.301
I think everyone in
the immediate family's doing it.

15:14.388 --> 15:16.699
Oh, yeah? Okay.
Good-Good idea.

15:19.028 --> 15:22.658
The hell is that? Some
kind of a gay protest thing?

15:22.748 --> 15:24.468
It's a candle, Dad.
What are you talking about?

15:24.589 --> 15:27.581
- Your purple panty tail.
- Oh, no. Oh, come on.

15:27.669 --> 15:29.705
We're in a church, Mitchell,
not some disco.

15:31.589 --> 15:33.022
You did that on purpose!

15:33.108 --> 15:35.021
Oh, this stained glass
is beautiful.

15:35.108 --> 15:38.180
Listen, before we dunk the kid, you
mind if I make a few casual remarks?

15:38.309 --> 15:39.788
I think you already did.

15:39.868 --> 15:43.829
Claire asked me a good question.
How did Phil win me over?

15:43.908 --> 15:45.628
Well, he hasn't yet.

15:45.709 --> 15:47.666
But when he stops
trying so hard...

15:47.748 --> 15:50.104
and he acts like a real person,
he comes close.

15:50.189 --> 15:52.545
And that's what I needed
to do with Pilar.

15:52.628 --> 15:56.464
I'd like to tell you the story of how
I came to meet my incredible wife,

15:56.549 --> 16:00.144
because up until the birth of this child,
it's the best thing that ever happened to me.

16:00.229 --> 16:01.628
Mmm, well,
that feels good, huh?

16:01.748 --> 16:03.661
So it's morning.
My car's getting waxed.

16:03.748 --> 16:06.584
I hop in the diner.
I hear this adorable accent.

16:06.670 --> 16:10.425
I turn. I see this pretty girl talking to her friend.
I send over a piece of pie.

16:10.550 --> 16:12.029
- All class.
- Mm-hmm.

16:12.109 --> 16:16.706
Couple of minutes later, who comes
over to thank me but Gloria,

16:16.789 --> 16:18.747
the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

16:18.830 --> 16:20.105
Amen.

16:20.190 --> 16:21.509
She sits down,
we start talking,

16:21.590 --> 16:22.818
and we haven't stopped
talking since.

16:22.950 --> 16:25.863
Aw. But
here's the crazy part.

16:25.950 --> 16:29.260
I didn't send the pie to Gloria.
Her back was to me.

16:29.350 --> 16:32.229
I sent it to her friend, who went
to the bathroom and missed it.

16:32.310 --> 16:35.747
And that person is here today,
Gloria's sister Sonia.

16:35.869 --> 16:40.182
Isn't it funny how a simple
twist of fate can change the whole-

16:40.310 --> 16:42.904
You stole my life!
No, Sonia!

16:43.029 --> 16:44.509
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold it, hold it.

16:44.590 --> 16:47.946
I got Sonia! I got Sonia!

16:48.029 --> 16:52.547
No more. I want my own life, my
own bed, my own e-mail account!

16:52.629 --> 16:54.461
Yeah, and leave
your poor old mother alone.

16:54.590 --> 16:58.061
Don't worry, Mamá. You can come and live with us.
Whoa. Pump the brakes here.

16:58.149 --> 16:59.788
Why? You have a problem
with my mother?

16:59.869 --> 17:01.667
No. Your mother
has a problem with me.

17:01.749 --> 17:04.948
- You think she's helpless. Ask her what's in that box.
- Isn't that the family gun?

17:05.029 --> 17:09.229
Jay, if anything should happen
to Gloria, I am there for you.

17:09.309 --> 17:11.300
What, Sonia?
What's going to happen to me?

17:11.390 --> 17:14.940
You might go for a walk in your
closet one day and never come back!

17:17.789 --> 17:19.986
You see what
you're missing? Huh?

17:22.190 --> 17:23.670
Where is Luke?

17:23.829 --> 17:26.584
I think he's the one standing
next to Matthew. Phil.

17:26.710 --> 17:29.066
He was feeling a little under the weather.
I let him stay home.

17:29.150 --> 17:30.788
Or is he just too embarrassed
to leave the house?

17:30.910 --> 17:33.903
Why would he be embarrassed? Because
Dad tried to fix all our problems...

17:33.989 --> 17:35.709
and instead
ruined all our lives.

17:35.789 --> 17:37.269
Nightmare.

17:37.390 --> 17:41.349
You girls are so dramatic. Do I
need to call you a wahmbulance?

17:41.430 --> 17:43.661
Wah-wah, wah-wah.

17:45.710 --> 17:47.223
Did you hear that?
Yes.

17:47.309 --> 17:49.028
Claire's been driving Lily
to dance class all week.

17:49.150 --> 17:50.349
That's where she gets it from.

17:50.390 --> 17:52.108
We're not bad parents.
Claire is. Huh.

17:52.190 --> 17:55.626
Oh! I said I wasn't gonna cry,
but, oh, boy, here it comes.

17:55.710 --> 17:57.588
Hmm!

17:57.671 --> 18:00.391
No, no, Cam.
Not with those.

18:00.550 --> 18:03.305
Okay! That's it!

18:03.391 --> 18:05.701
We're in
a house of God, damn it.

18:05.790 --> 18:08.750
Fine. Everyone
just abandon me.

18:08.830 --> 18:11.391
Pilar, all due respect, no
one's buying the martyr act.

18:11.471 --> 18:13.144
Not even this guy.

18:13.231 --> 18:15.301
You ask me, you've been keeping
this one under your thumb...

18:15.391 --> 18:17.144
'cause you're afraid
of going on with your life.

18:17.231 --> 18:21.191
But you're an attractive woman with a lot to offer.
This could be an opportunity.

18:21.270 --> 18:23.911
Hell, I don't even think I knew
what happiness was till I was 60.

18:23.990 --> 18:25.549
And the hits
just keep coming. Okay.

18:25.631 --> 18:29.067
Sonia, we're gonna help you get your
own place, have some independence.

18:29.191 --> 18:32.501
And if you ever get lonely, you
come visit us as much as you want-

18:32.590 --> 18:34.388
within reason.

18:34.510 --> 18:36.787
And we'll send this one
down to visit you. What?

18:36.871 --> 18:39.625
But he's not gonna become
a priest, 'cause he likes girls.

18:39.711 --> 18:41.384
Can't get 'em,
but he likes 'em.

18:41.471 --> 18:44.191
So, everybody think about it.

18:44.270 --> 18:47.627
But not for too long. There's a A.A.
meeting here at 6:00.

18:48.631 --> 18:50.509
Sonia, please,
let us do this for you.

18:50.590 --> 18:54.186
I really want you to be happy.
Can you forgive me?

18:54.310 --> 18:56.951
It will take some time.
As much as you need.

18:57.070 --> 18:59.711
And some dresses.
As many as you want.

18:59.790 --> 19:00.941
And some shoes.

19:01.871 --> 19:03.463
You're angry now.

19:03.550 --> 19:06.019
Whatever
happened with the kids,

19:06.111 --> 19:07.864
I don't want you
to feel bad about it.

19:07.951 --> 19:10.227
I don't.

19:10.310 --> 19:14.463
I now invite the godfather
and the godmother to join us.

19:14.550 --> 19:17.191
Don't worry. I will take
care of everything tomorrow.

19:17.270 --> 19:20.150
That may not be necessary,
my wife.

19:20.231 --> 19:23.269
Phil and Claire, as godparents,

19:23.350 --> 19:26.344
are you ready to help the parents
of this child in their duties?

19:26.431 --> 19:28.229
We are.

19:28.310 --> 19:30.905
Do you renounce Satan?

19:35.310 --> 19:37.701
I do renounce him.

19:42.790 --> 19:44.019
And all his works?

19:48.951 --> 19:50.545
I do renounce them.

19:53.712 --> 19:56.943
Hey! Hey!

20:01.472 --> 20:03.463
And all his empty promises?

20:08.432 --> 20:11.310
Oh, my God!

20:11.392 --> 20:13.748
I do renounce them.

20:15.712 --> 20:19.261
Godfather, is it your wish
that this child be baptized?

20:19.351 --> 20:20.866
It is.

20:36.392 --> 20:40.146
In the name of the Father and
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

20:40.232 --> 20:42.109
What name
have you given the child?

20:42.232 --> 20:46.145
Fulgencio Joseph Pritchett.

20:46.232 --> 20:48.872
May God be with you all.

20:48.952 --> 20:50.385
Thank you, Jay.

20:50.511 --> 20:53.071
We're never gonna call him that.

20:58.392 --> 21:01.510
So I heard that somebody
released a bunch of rats...

21:01.591 --> 21:03.822
into Karen Sullivan's party
the other night.

21:03.912 --> 21:08.463
And Lee Cooper's camper
just rolled into her lemon tree.

21:08.551 --> 21:10.145
Luke isn't having any problem
at school anymore...

21:10.232 --> 21:12.827
because Reuben admitted
he made the whole thing up.

21:12.912 --> 21:14.107
Isn't that crazy,

21:14.232 --> 21:16.072
how all of our kids' problems
just disappeared?

21:16.991 --> 21:19.143
Don't ever ask me
about my business, Claire.

21:19.232 --> 21:20.825
What are you talking about?

21:20.952 --> 21:24.023
Don't ask me about my business.
I wasn't.

21:24.112 --> 21:27.263
Good. Don't.
