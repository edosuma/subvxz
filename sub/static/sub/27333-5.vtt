00:07.974 --> 00:09.853
MOLLY: Previously, on
Marvel's Runaways...

00:09.937 --> 00:12.399
All I need is an 18-core,
36-thread processor chip.

00:12.483 --> 00:14.571
-What?
-We're going back to Atlas Academy.

00:14.655 --> 00:15.740
ALEX: We can destroy the dig site,

00:15.823 --> 00:18.495
then we can stop California
from cracking off into the ocean.

00:18.579 --> 00:20.374
-I need a favor.
-Sure.

00:20.457 --> 00:22.002
But I'll need something
in return, obvi.

00:22.086 --> 00:22.921
Name it.

00:23.004 --> 00:26.804
I actually came to see if you have
any of my anxiety meds here?

00:26.887 --> 00:30.018
It's turning black!
Necrosis, yes!

00:30.603 --> 00:33.024
Hold on a second.
It's an earthquake!

00:34.318 --> 00:35.780
I don't know what I'm doing.

00:35.863 --> 00:37.032
Just don't stop.

00:37.867 --> 00:39.245
You're not wearing your bracelet.

00:39.328 --> 00:40.915
KAROLINA:
Yeah, I don't need it anymore.

00:42.084 --> 00:43.044
[text message sends]

00:43.128 --> 00:44.213
Are you sick?

00:44.798 --> 00:46.009
I don't know if I can trust you.

00:46.092 --> 00:47.637
I'm going to trust myself.

00:49.265 --> 00:51.060
MOLLY: You're the first person
who's had my eyes.

00:51.114 --> 00:53.002
CHASE:
What the...?

00:53.816 --> 00:55.737
You guys, he's not going anywhere.

00:55.820 --> 00:57.364
ALEX:
Who are you?

00:57.448 --> 00:59.452
You're nothing like Molly.

01:00.037 --> 01:01.080
You get high off this stuff, don't you?

01:06.049 --> 01:08.721
TOPHER: When I tell people
I grew up in the suburbs,

01:08.804 --> 01:10.767
they always ask what that was like.

01:10.850 --> 01:14.065
And I tell 'em, it was great,
if you like coyotes.

01:14.148 --> 01:15.777
'Cause that's how my parents were.

01:16.862 --> 01:17.864
[bicycle bell ringing]

01:17.947 --> 01:20.035
They were predators
who traveled in a pack.

01:20.118 --> 01:22.206
-Go on!
-And if they spotted any weakness,

01:22.289 --> 01:24.335
-they'd tear you apart.
-Get out of my house!

01:24.418 --> 01:25.963
Dad, no, please!

01:26.047 --> 01:28.259
[stammers] Dad, this is my home, too!
I don't want to go!

01:28.844 --> 01:29.846
Never come back!

01:29.930 --> 01:31.684
-Mom...
-Go!

01:31.767 --> 01:33.186
TOPHER:
It's like they were born mean,

01:33.269 --> 01:36.694
and nothing I said or did
could ever make it better.

01:38.405 --> 01:41.285
So one day, I-- I ran.

01:42.371 --> 01:44.041
And never looked back.

01:45.460 --> 01:47.297
I'm so sorry.

01:47.381 --> 01:49.886
[chuckles] Everybody got a story, right?

01:49.970 --> 01:52.057
And that's a good one,
but you still haven't answered my question

01:52.141 --> 01:54.855
about what's in here
and why it's so important.

01:56.232 --> 01:57.944
Why do you care?

01:58.027 --> 02:00.031
You don't see me asking questions
about your magic wand, eh?

02:00.115 --> 02:03.622
Or those metal gloves One Direction here
carries in his backpack.

02:03.706 --> 02:04.916
Or the dinosaur?

02:05.000 --> 02:07.087
Anybody want to explain that?
'Cause I'm all ears.

02:07.171 --> 02:09.341
This is about our questions,
OK, not yours.

02:09.425 --> 02:11.597
GERT: And accusing us of hypocrisy
is not gonna get you off the hook.

02:11.680 --> 02:13.934
That is called "Whataboutism,"
and it's a logical fallacy.

02:14.018 --> 02:15.228
She was on the debate team,

02:15.312 --> 02:17.650
and we're not as trusting
as we used to be.

02:17.734 --> 02:20.030
Also, was the One Direction thing
an insult or a compliment?

02:21.407 --> 02:23.788
If you want me to go, I'll go but--
I'm taking that with me.

02:23.871 --> 02:24.915
No, that's not what we want.

02:26.627 --> 02:28.296
Well, that's not what I want.

02:28.379 --> 02:31.427
Don't leave. My parents are gone,
Graciela's gone.

02:31.512 --> 02:33.557
Just answer the question, please.

02:33.641 --> 02:36.103
OK.

02:36.187 --> 02:38.441
I'm just afraid my answers
are gonna let you down.

02:38.526 --> 02:39.861
Try me.

02:43.828 --> 02:47.209
[sighs] Little while
after I left home, I, uh...

02:47.292 --> 02:49.548
I was digging in the trash downtown.

02:49.631 --> 02:53.388
Hungry, cold, just... wondering
if I could even survive on my own.

02:53.471 --> 02:55.100
"It was a dark and stormy night,"
we get it.

02:55.183 --> 02:56.227
Fast-forward to the part about this.

02:57.522 --> 03:02.740
I found one of those...
how do you say, um... terrarios.

03:02.824 --> 03:04.493
A terrarium? Like, for a lizard?

03:04.578 --> 03:07.542
Exacto. Inside were these rocks.

03:07.625 --> 03:08.627
They were glowing.

03:10.882 --> 03:13.261
I picked them up.

03:13.344 --> 03:18.354
And the second I did,
I felt freaking incredible.

03:19.566 --> 03:21.570
Then I saw myself in the glass.

03:21.653 --> 03:23.949
My eyes. They were yellow.

03:28.374 --> 03:29.878
I felt like I could do anything.

03:47.914 --> 03:52.840
[sighs] That rush. I went from wanting
to die to just... never feeling better.

03:53.424 --> 03:55.721
And it wasn't even just me
that was fuerte.

03:55.805 --> 03:57.767
Just for a minute, it...

03:57.850 --> 03:59.771
Everything was right with the world.

04:02.819 --> 04:05.533
That sounds like something
that should require a prescription.

04:05.616 --> 04:07.829
Except there's nothing like it.

04:07.912 --> 04:10.125
[sighs] I took those rocks,
I ground them up.

04:10.208 --> 04:13.256
I've been stretching them out since then.

04:13.339 --> 04:16.220
But, as you can see,
it ain't gonna last forever.

04:16.303 --> 04:19.017
When we first met, you told me
you just came into your powers like I did.

04:20.563 --> 04:21.565
Lo siento mucho, hermanita.

04:21.648 --> 04:24.988
I... I wanted you think
that I was like you,

04:25.071 --> 04:28.662
not some... [sighs]

04:28.746 --> 04:31.042
...some dumpster-diving junkie.

04:36.427 --> 04:37.429
Look.

04:38.014 --> 04:40.101
What you're holding
is all I have left.

04:41.353 --> 04:42.565
Then I'll stop, en seco.

04:43.901 --> 04:45.361
He means "cold turkey."

04:46.447 --> 04:48.367
TOPHER: But until then...

04:49.913 --> 04:50.956
por favor, what you have

04:51.040 --> 04:53.419
is the only thing that's
making my life bearable.

04:54.839 --> 04:59.766
Please. I won't cause any trouble.
I swear.

05:11.122 --> 05:16.215
Still, you guys are like each other.
Yellow eyes, super strength.

05:16.298 --> 05:18.512
I mean, Topher found rocks,
and so did your parents.

05:18.595 --> 05:21.100
Yeah, but the Hernandezes' rocks
came from the dig site.

05:21.183 --> 05:22.812
They were only ever there
and in the lab.

05:22.895 --> 05:27.112
So how would they have also ended up
in a lizard cage in the garbage?

05:27.195 --> 05:31.412
I think Topher gets to stay.
Nico's OK with an honest junkie,

05:31.495 --> 05:33.542
and Chase and Alex
want to solve a mystery.

05:34.502 --> 05:35.796
What about you, Gert?

05:36.798 --> 05:38.510
I just want to know
what happened to the lizard.

05:40.890 --> 05:42.560
One day at a time, right?

05:43.562 --> 05:44.564
[Old Lace roars]

05:44.647 --> 05:46.192
My guard dog is watching you.

05:47.653 --> 05:49.991
[roars]

05:50.993 --> 05:52.245
[sniffs]

06:03.518 --> 06:06.106
Alex said the rocks
came from a construction site?

06:06.190 --> 06:07.234
It's a long story.

06:08.486 --> 06:09.697
Well, I got nothin' else to do.

06:12.327 --> 06:13.956
I can show you better than tell.

06:26.397 --> 06:27.399
So that's what this is.

06:35.708 --> 06:36.960
Tell me about it.

06:40.466 --> 06:42.638
JONAH: Don't be afraid.
Everything I've worked towards,

06:42.722 --> 06:45.728
everything I've done...
is for this.

06:52.616 --> 06:56.248
For what? A-- a pile of dirt
and the remains of a dump truck?

06:56.331 --> 06:57.501
I don't understand.

06:57.585 --> 06:59.171
Actually, I think you do.

07:01.300 --> 07:03.847
Look at this. What do you think we are?

07:03.930 --> 07:05.016
KAROLINA:
I don't know.

07:05.099 --> 07:07.062
I've read the Book of Gibborim
a thousand times.

07:07.145 --> 07:08.982
Am-- am I an angel?

07:10.026 --> 07:11.487
Or something divine?

07:11.571 --> 07:13.032
In your grandfather's language, yes.

07:13.115 --> 07:14.911
Those were the concepts
that he understood,

07:14.994 --> 07:19.211
but there's another answer,
and it's a little more simple.

07:20.714 --> 07:22.175
Come here. Come over here.

07:22.258 --> 07:23.260
Check it out.

07:27.853 --> 07:29.481
Stick your hand in that crevasse.

07:30.149 --> 07:31.360
Because that doesn't
sound scary at all.

07:31.443 --> 07:34.449
[laughing] I know it sounds scary,
but come on, just give it a try.

07:37.413 --> 07:38.499
It's OK.

07:50.189 --> 07:51.441
[Karolina gasps]

07:51.543 --> 07:53.187
KAROLINA:
Whoa!

07:55.449 --> 07:56.451
Whoa.

07:59.040 --> 08:00.752
That is definitely not just dirt.

08:01.336 --> 08:04.134
What we're standing on is my ship.

08:06.890 --> 08:09.019
How did a ship get all the way down here?

08:09.102 --> 08:10.104
It fell from the sky.

08:11.106 --> 08:12.568
A spaceship?

08:12.776 --> 08:13.945
A spaceship.

08:14.029 --> 08:17.160
I would have heard about that.
Everyone would have heard about that.

08:17.243 --> 08:20.082
There would be stories
or something, like Area 51.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.794
Trust me, there were no witnesses.

08:22.796 --> 08:25.259
My arrival predates recorded history.

08:25.343 --> 08:27.180
We understand time
a little differently than humans,

08:27.263 --> 08:29.142
and you will, too.

08:29.226 --> 08:30.186
Humans?

08:31.522 --> 08:32.524
You wanted answers.

08:38.327 --> 08:39.371
I'm...

08:40.957 --> 08:41.960
I'm an alien?

08:42.418 --> 08:43.419
So are they.

08:57.282 --> 08:59.912
I was fortunate enough to eject
right before impact.

09:01.791 --> 09:03.587
They've been trapped here this whole time.

09:06.300 --> 09:08.137
It's taken me so long to reach them.

09:11.644 --> 09:13.147
Soon they'll be free.

09:14.567 --> 09:15.944
You've been trying to save them.

09:18.157 --> 09:19.159
Yes.

09:24.377 --> 09:25.379
Karolina.

09:27.050 --> 09:28.845
I'd like to introduce you to your brother.

[theme music playing]

11:14.557 --> 11:16.561
[teeth brushing]

11:23.825 --> 11:24.910
Buenos dias, hermana.

11:29.043 --> 11:32.133
I know Molly thinks that you guys
might be related, but...

11:33.511 --> 11:34.847
[spits]

11:35.932 --> 11:38.061
I'm her sister, not yours.

11:39.230 --> 11:41.944
We live in the same house.
We eat at the same table.

11:42.028 --> 11:44.240
Out on the streets,
that makes you my sister.

11:45.075 --> 11:46.954
Con dientes brillantes. [laughs]

11:47.038 --> 11:48.457
It's not funny.

11:48.541 --> 11:52.591
I can, like, feel the decay
destroying my enamel.

11:54.595 --> 11:55.639
I know it's not funny.

11:56.641 --> 11:57.976
It's more loco.

12:00.439 --> 12:02.485
Nothing crazy about good hygiene.

12:06.159 --> 12:07.370
You're not right in the head, huh?

12:10.250 --> 12:11.754
You know, I can help with that.

12:11.837 --> 12:12.839
How?

12:13.675 --> 12:16.012
I know where you can get the stuff
to take the edge off.

12:16.597 --> 12:19.143
Seroquel, Zoloft. Whatever you need.

12:20.312 --> 12:21.941
La farmacia subterránea's got it.

12:23.861 --> 12:25.782
I think that would really help.

12:28.495 --> 12:29.665
You would do that for me?

12:29.748 --> 12:33.881
Claro. The sister of my sister
is my sister.

13:19.807 --> 13:22.228
Karolina. Hey.

13:22.311 --> 13:25.025
There you are.
What are you doing in Alex's room?

13:25.109 --> 13:27.656
Alex was just about to ask the same thing.

13:28.240 --> 13:31.747
Oh, I um... I couldn't sleep.
Just thinking about the mission.

13:32.331 --> 13:33.918
Wanted to see if I could help.

13:35.379 --> 13:36.422
Can you?

13:36.507 --> 13:39.137
ALEX:
I don't need it. This plan's all me.

13:39.220 --> 13:42.434
I mean, al-- also my hacking computer,
but still, mostly me.

13:42.519 --> 13:44.815
[laughs] Great. Then we're all set.

13:45.525 --> 13:49.490
Sorry, I'm just restless.
Let's just do this already.

13:54.333 --> 13:55.670
I'm so not deleting that.

13:55.753 --> 13:59.010
Fifteen thousand likes
and a repost by Lil Yachty.

13:59.093 --> 14:00.972
I mean, I'm verified now, so forget it.

14:01.055 --> 14:03.603
Who is "Little Yachty,"
and why is that even important?

14:03.686 --> 14:06.692
No, you can't intimidate me.
I brought my lawyers.

14:06.775 --> 14:07.777
You're not under arrest.

14:07.861 --> 14:10.617
We're just looking for our kids.

14:10.700 --> 14:14.332
You're the last one to see 'em.
Please. We're asking for help.

14:14.415 --> 14:16.085
-STACEY: Did you see Gert?
-Did she-- was she sort of

14:16.169 --> 14:18.674
rashing around the neck?
That's her stress indicator.

14:18.758 --> 14:21.471
Yeah, and Chase seemed a little pale.
Do you know if that was the lighting,

14:21.555 --> 14:24.143
or do you think that he's... sick?

14:26.774 --> 14:28.068
Are you willing to grant me immunity?

14:28.151 --> 14:30.489
You're not charged with anything.
You don't need lawyers, Eiffel.

14:31.951 --> 14:33.829
-Yes, we grant you immunity.
-You are immune.

14:34.665 --> 14:37.002
Look, all I know is that
they needed my master key

14:37.086 --> 14:38.965
so that Alvin
could get his special laptop.

14:39.048 --> 14:41.010
Alex. His name is Alex.

14:41.094 --> 14:42.555
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's not.

14:43.390 --> 14:45.060
Anyways, when people start
talking about computers,

14:45.143 --> 14:47.147
I like to go imaginary shopping.

14:52.074 --> 14:53.159
OK, are we done here?

15:00.215 --> 15:01.677
[door beeps]

15:03.639 --> 15:05.225
Sorry to interrupt, Jonah.

15:05.308 --> 15:07.605
Here's Mr. Dean, as you requested.

15:08.607 --> 15:10.277
I didn't need the escort.

15:11.530 --> 15:14.243
You know, these two have become
a real asset to the Church.

15:14.326 --> 15:15.328
Yes.

15:15.412 --> 15:17.082
Yeah, they're great.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.420
But have you ever noticed
how you never see one alone?

15:19.504 --> 15:21.842
They're like the girls
in The Shining. [chuckles]

15:24.096 --> 15:25.808
It's a-- that's a joke.

15:26.392 --> 15:29.315
It's a movie. It's-- you haven't...
seen the movie.

15:30.317 --> 15:34.200
-I'm sorry.
-Frances, Aura. Thank you.

15:34.283 --> 15:35.285
I'll take it from here.

15:35.368 --> 15:37.916
-Of course, Jonah.
-Journey in brightness.

15:42.174 --> 15:45.013
You know, I've been building up
quite a nice relationship with those two.

15:46.099 --> 15:48.228
They understand their place.

15:48.311 --> 15:50.900
Their place is sitting on the roof,
scaring the pigeons.

15:53.113 --> 15:55.158
I'm wondering if you understand yours.

15:56.202 --> 15:58.289
I've given you a great deal
of power here, Frank.

15:59.543 --> 16:03.634
Yes. But I'd like to think that you
recognized my natural abilities

16:03.717 --> 16:07.600
and found an opportunity
that was beneficial for both of us, right?

16:08.476 --> 16:10.188
I suppose that's one way
to look at it, yes,

16:10.272 --> 16:14.405
but the time has come that I now need
something from you.

16:20.375 --> 16:21.377
What the hell is this?

16:21.460 --> 16:25.177
Frank, as you know,
our Church teaches that there is no death.

16:26.429 --> 16:29.561
All the energy that exists,
that shall ever exist,

16:29.644 --> 16:32.357
was created
with the birth of the universe.

16:33.359 --> 16:36.867
It cannot be destroyed, only converted.

16:38.537 --> 16:42.754
This is supported by science,
and of course by religion.

16:43.714 --> 16:47.095
What I'm about to ask of you
is going to test your faith.

16:47.931 --> 16:49.016
What are you asking me?

16:49.099 --> 16:51.103
Your wife, Leslie, ran a program for me...

16:52.105 --> 16:57.533
a program that it's no exaggeration to say
I owe my life to.

16:59.996 --> 17:01.917
I'm handing you that responsibility.

17:03.461 --> 17:04.673
I'm honored.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.720
But I'm afraid I don't quite understand.

17:10.349 --> 17:12.396
I've told you everything you need to know.

17:13.397 --> 17:14.818
Now, go get me a runaway.

17:24.169 --> 17:25.589
Or don't come back.

17:30.516 --> 17:32.895
[incoming text message chimes]

17:32.979 --> 17:37.572
[sighs] Well, I've never been more
intimidated by a teenage girl in my life.

17:37.655 --> 17:39.116
You didn't know me in high school.

17:39.199 --> 17:40.368
I wouldn't want to.

17:40.452 --> 17:43.082
What kind of special laptop
are they even looking for?

17:44.168 --> 17:46.380
Alex got an "A+" in Ethical Hacking.

17:46.464 --> 17:47.800
He loved that computer.

17:49.136 --> 17:50.681
Apparently it cost a hundred grand.

17:50.765 --> 17:52.225
Our tuition dollars at work.

17:52.309 --> 17:55.065
If he knows how to use it,
he could do some real damage.

17:55.148 --> 17:56.818
To us or any of our interests.

17:56.902 --> 17:59.448
Including the dig site,
which they've attempted already.

17:59.532 --> 18:02.120
You know, it's interesting
that you bring that up, Leslie.

18:02.204 --> 18:04.291
Perhaps you'd like to tell us all
what Karolina and Jonah

18:04.375 --> 18:05.377
were doing there together.

18:05.460 --> 18:06.420
What are you talking about?

18:06.505 --> 18:08.717
Please, we saw them
when we were testing the poison.

18:08.801 --> 18:11.180
-We did.
-Jonah is meeting with one of our kids?

18:11.263 --> 18:13.017
-And you didn't tell us.
-I didn't know.

18:13.101 --> 18:14.395
You saw her?

18:15.438 --> 18:17.025
Why didn't you call me?
I would have come right there.

18:17.109 --> 18:18.403
We were on a covert mission.

18:18.486 --> 18:20.323
Emphasis on the "covert."

18:21.409 --> 18:22.411
Although he may have seen us.

18:22.494 --> 18:24.456
-Oh, he definitely did.
-Well, that doesn't make any sense.

18:24.541 --> 18:25.960
I know. Usually, we're so stealthy.

18:26.043 --> 18:30.343
But now, if he knows what you two
are up to, how are you still alive?

18:30.427 --> 18:32.724
Oh, believe me, we've been
sleeping with the lights on.

18:32.807 --> 18:33.809
DALE: Uh-huh.

18:33.892 --> 18:35.646
Also, uh, we haven't really been,
uh, sleeping.

18:35.730 --> 18:36.732
I mean, just a couple hours.

18:36.815 --> 18:38.109
There has to be something else.

18:38.192 --> 18:40.488
Maybe spending time with his daughter
has mellowed him.

18:40.573 --> 18:42.618
Yeah, well, I don't want him
hanging out with Alex.

18:42.702 --> 18:45.039
And if Jonah knows where our kids are,
he needs to tell us.

18:45.123 --> 18:46.375
CATHERINE:
What makes you think he will?

18:46.459 --> 18:48.129
It's not like we can just make him.

18:48.212 --> 18:49.591
I'll take care of Jonah.

18:50.801 --> 18:54.141
That's... kind of you to offer.

18:54.224 --> 18:55.686
"A" for effort, definitely, but--

18:55.770 --> 18:57.982
Doubt all you want,

18:58.065 --> 19:01.990
but my entire advantage is the fact
that people underestimate me.

19:02.073 --> 19:03.034
True.

19:06.583 --> 19:08.419
I can handle this.

19:08.504 --> 19:09.506
Handle him.

19:12.427 --> 19:13.847
I've been working on something.

19:14.724 --> 19:15.768
You gonna tell us what?

19:17.939 --> 19:19.483
No.

19:19.567 --> 19:21.905
Either I'll succeed, or I won't.

19:21.988 --> 19:23.784
But it'll be on me alone.

19:27.332 --> 19:29.336
I'm doing this as Amy's father.

19:34.639 --> 19:35.641
All right.

19:37.562 --> 19:39.732
In the meantime, we're all still at risk
for a security breach.

19:39.816 --> 19:42.445
I suggest everyone change their passcodes
on their Wizphones

19:42.530 --> 19:44.157
and any other devices you have.

19:45.285 --> 19:47.163
Dale, do not change yours to "Stacey."

19:47.247 --> 19:48.876
What?

19:48.959 --> 19:51.422
Oh, I was-- I wasn't changing it
to "Stacey." [scoffs]

19:52.340 --> 19:54.679
-I so wasn't.
-[phone chiming]

19:54.762 --> 19:57.142
I've been looking for him
for the past 15 minutes!

19:57.225 --> 19:59.146
Topher's gone! His room's empty.

19:59.229 --> 20:00.524
And he left because of you!

20:00.608 --> 20:02.612
You made him feel like
he didn't belong here.

20:02.695 --> 20:04.323
He left because
he thought you'd lead him

20:04.406 --> 20:06.076
to enough rocks to refill his vial.

20:06.160 --> 20:07.495
-And you didn't.
-That's bullshit!

20:08.080 --> 20:09.124
-Did Molly just curse?
-Yep.

20:09.207 --> 20:11.003
PG-13, but definitely a curse word.

20:11.086 --> 20:13.257
-He cares about me!
-He cares about getting high.

20:13.341 --> 20:16.472
OK, enough! Let's not jump
to any conclusions, all right?

20:16.556 --> 20:17.850
Maybe Topher's just out there

20:17.934 --> 20:19.896
raiding Cheesecake Factory
dumpsters for breakfast.

20:19.979 --> 20:21.650
[sighs] I'd even settle for Islands.

20:22.652 --> 20:24.071
For Molly's sake.

20:24.154 --> 20:26.283
Guys, he could just be out
getting things for people

20:26.367 --> 20:28.747

Hey, guys.

20:31.836 --> 20:33.339
I don't think he's coming back here.

20:34.383 --> 20:36.053

Shit, he took the map to the dig site.

20:36.136 --> 20:38.182
MOLLY: And the card
about the rocks my parents found.

20:38.767 --> 20:40.771
He asked me a lot of questions last night.

20:40.854 --> 20:41.940
Questions about the dig site?

20:42.023 --> 20:43.860
What? We were trying to figure out
our connection.

20:43.944 --> 20:45.488
Oh, no, I'm-- I'm not mad, I'm just--

20:45.572 --> 20:47.200
He's gone to find more rocks.

20:47.283 --> 20:48.704
CHASE:
We gotta do something.

20:48.787 --> 20:51.083
Do you think he would try to get
in the hole, because that's not safe.

20:53.212 --> 20:55.008
For him. I mean,
because he might get hurt.

20:55.091 --> 20:56.427
Or he gets high and he hurts someone else.

20:56.511 --> 20:58.974
If he gets caught,
who knows what they'll do to him?

21:00.309 --> 21:01.980
Which is the same thing
that I did to Graciela.

21:02.063 --> 21:06.071
No, she was a sweet, innocent lady,
not some shady rock molester.

21:06.155 --> 21:08.618
Look, what happens to Topher
is on him at this point, OK?

21:08.702 --> 21:10.246
But no way can he screw up our plan.

21:10.329 --> 21:12.208

-It does to me.

Oh, my God!

27:53.218 --> 27:55.347
Those were my parents. You were there?

Tell me, Topher, now!

27:58.688 --> 27:59.690

Help me!

28:05.910 --> 28:08.498
[sirens approaching]

28:22.652 --> 28:24.405
So I left out a few details.

28:25.407 --> 28:26.869
What difference does it make, huh?

28:26.952 --> 28:29.833
What difference does it make?
You lied to me!

28:29.916 --> 28:33.507
After we stayed up all night talking,
trying to figure out the truth!

28:33.591 --> 28:34.760
He lies about everything.

28:34.843 --> 28:37.599
Including his age.
Molly's parents died ten years ago.

28:37.682 --> 28:39.561
What, Topher worked at the lab
when he was eight?

28:39.645 --> 28:41.565
The explosion. It changed him.

28:41.649 --> 28:43.653
OK, just stop! Stop!

28:43.736 --> 28:46.825
You're my family!
You're supposed to forgive me!

28:46.909 --> 28:50.374
You've had too many chances.
You lie. You steal.

28:50.457 --> 28:54.090
You hurt people!
You are no longer a part of this family.

No, don't hurt him! Let me try.

29:04.110 --> 29:06.239
Topher, you have to leave right now,

29:06.322 --> 29:07.992
before you do something
you can't take back.

29:08.076 --> 29:10.497
We know what's in the backpack,
and it's making you crazy.

29:10.581 --> 29:12.251
-You need help.
-You don't know me!

29:12.334 --> 29:14.380
They don't know me!
No one knows me!

29:14.463 --> 29:16.844

29:17.344 --> 29:18.931

Is he-- is he sick?

32:20.293 --> 32:21.546
For all those years, how did you do it?

I'll explain it to you the way
that he explained it to me.

32:30.271 --> 32:34.238
All life consumes other life
in order to survive.

32:34.321 --> 32:35.783

Let's hope she sees through
his manipulation better than you did.

to be a completely open and free spirit.

-Mm.

Are. A great parent.

Hm.

Why would I want to destroy something
that I just found out existed?

any more annoyed with me than usual,

'cause it means she's stopped caring.

to my level of annoyance

that it doesn't register anymore
and she kind of just tunes me out.

42:25.002 --> 42:28.718
Or-- or... maybe you're in a relationship.

42:28.801 --> 42:31.222
[sighs] Yeah. Probably that.

42:34.980 --> 42:37.109
Do you ever wish you were in one?

42:37.192 --> 42:39.196
With Nico, or the girl you met in Compton?

42:39.280 --> 42:43.539
ALEX:
Mm, nah. This is my girlfriend now.

42:43.623 --> 42:45.208
Let me tell ya, I am a lucky man.

42:45.292 --> 42:49.216
I mean, she is beautiful and smart.

42:49.300 --> 42:51.179
Yes, I know I'm talking about a computer.

42:52.264 --> 42:56.022
No, I get it. Kinda how I felt
about my first lacrosse stick.

42:56.105 --> 42:58.276
I spent hours just taping the shaft.

42:58.360 --> 43:00.990
I even strung the pocket myself.

43:01.074 --> 43:02.786
Stringing the pocket is very personal.

43:03.495 --> 43:08.004
Well, not to take anything
away from your... taped shaft,

43:08.088 --> 43:10.092
but my lady here is gonna help me

43:10.175 --> 43:12.597
take down that construction site
once and for all.

43:13.599 --> 43:14.601
Crack this open for me?

43:18.233 --> 43:19.443
It really is called a shaft.

43:21.573 --> 43:22.575
Yeah.

43:25.915 --> 43:26.917
Hey.

43:27.919 --> 43:29.046
Did Nico send you?

43:30.048 --> 43:31.760
'Cause I'm not gonna take back
what I said to her.

43:32.386 --> 43:33.764
You don't have to.

43:35.434 --> 43:36.562
You know, in fact...

43:40.903 --> 43:42.322
In fact, I...

43:43.617 --> 43:46.540
I just wanted to tell you
how proud I was of you today.

43:46.623 --> 43:48.753
Proud of me? Why?

43:48.836 --> 43:51.174
'Cause you saw Topher
as a human being.

43:52.176 --> 43:53.386
You looked at him...

43:55.808 --> 43:59.482
and-- and you saw one of us,
just another kid.

44:01.360 --> 44:04.450
And you stood by him, stood up for him.

44:04.534 --> 44:06.622
And Nico blasted him with the Staff.

44:06.705 --> 44:09.126
And I don't even know
if he's dead or alive right now--

44:09.210 --> 44:11.548
This isn't about
what Nico said or did.

44:12.550 --> 44:15.430
It isn't even about Topher.
This is about you.

44:16.015 --> 44:17.811
You're not a kid anymore.

44:17.894 --> 44:22.402
You're growing
into an amazing young woman

44:22.486 --> 44:26.829
with strength and integrity

44:26.912 --> 44:29.876
and a fierce sense of right and wrong.

44:30.878 --> 44:33.509
I just want to say I admire that,
that's all.

44:36.849 --> 44:40.438
I know that thinking
that Topher was my brother was stupid.

44:42.317 --> 44:45.240
-But I just wanted a family so bad.
-GERT: Hey.

44:46.910 --> 44:49.331
-[crying]
-It's OK.

44:50.626 --> 44:52.337
Listen.

44:52.421 --> 44:53.549
You have a family...

44:54.676 --> 44:58.016
who will take you back no matter what.

44:58.099 --> 45:00.312
They're all in this house right now.

45:01.397 --> 45:05.531
Any mistake you make,
any crazy thing that you might do,

45:05.615 --> 45:08.119
they will love you unconditionally.

45:09.706 --> 45:11.960
That's how you know who your family is.

45:12.962 --> 45:14.716
They love beyond reason.

45:19.308 --> 45:20.937
Today sucked.

45:23.232 --> 45:24.778
I got you, Mols.

45:26.823 --> 45:27.825
I got you.

45:37.302 --> 45:39.306
["Buckets" by Kodacrome playing]

45:53.167 --> 45:54.504
Hey, it's OK, girl.

45:55.088 --> 45:56.215
I love you.

45:57.217 --> 45:58.679

Feeling a little better?

48:53.779 --> 48:55.114
Yeah, thank you.

48:55.699 --> 48:57.703
Your parents should be here
to pick you up in a little while.
