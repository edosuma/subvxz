WEBVTT

00:01.260 --> 00:02.022
Previously on Elementary...
So tell me, Father,

00:02.070 --> 00:04.061
how are you to
help me this time?

00:04.100 --> 00:06.239
Give your assent,
and I will see you restored

00:06.270 --> 00:08.488
to the employ of
the New York Police Department.

00:08.540 --> 00:10.735
Sherlock is gonna accept
your help.

00:10.770 --> 00:13.204
He wants to go back to the
NYPD. I'm gonna go with him.

00:13.240 --> 00:16.038
I can't imagine why you would
deliver it as a threat.

00:16.080 --> 00:17.672
If you're gonna be a part
of Sherlock's life again,

00:17.710 --> 00:19.814
I want to make one thing clear.

00:19.850 --> 00:22.216
I'm not gonna let you hurt him.

00:25.520 --> 00:28.080
(sighs)

00:28.120 --> 00:30.088
Oh...

00:30.130 --> 00:32.553
Are you cooking?
Or did we get stampeded

00:32.600 --> 00:33.794
by a class of
second graders?

00:33.830 --> 00:36.196
I'm cooking. For Clyde.

00:36.230 --> 00:39.199
I'm formulating
a home blend of snacks

00:39.240 --> 00:42.607
to increase his mineral intake.

00:42.640 --> 00:45.359
Oh, um,
I stopped by the station.

00:45.410 --> 00:47.071
I ran into Captain Gregson.

00:47.110 --> 00:49.078
Did he seem pleased
about the Chief of Detectives'

00:49.110 --> 00:50.771
sudden reversal
regarding our status?

00:50.810 --> 00:53.370
He did. And as far
as I could tell,

00:53.420 --> 00:56.719
he didn't know anything about
your father pulling any strings.

00:56.750 --> 00:58.547
Just a higher-up
changing his mind.

00:58.590 --> 01:01.354
Well, the captain
is a political animal.

01:01.390 --> 01:05.156
I'm sure he's used to not
looking gift horses In mouths.

01:05.190 --> 01:07.351
Mmm. So, how much longer are
you gonna be in here for?

01:07.400 --> 01:10.392
Because this housemate
needs to eat, too.

01:13.140 --> 01:15.859
Bike
shanng.

01:15.900 --> 01:18.698
I'm gonna make
some calls.

01:18.740 --> 01:20.708
Oh. What about the bowls?

01:20.740 --> 01:22.378
They'll hose right off.

01:22.410 --> 01:25.243
Outside, not in the sink.

01:26.320 --> 01:29.118
(sighs)

01:29.150 --> 01:31.539
(siren wailing in distance)

01:45.430 --> 01:47.432
(door shuts)
On your knees!

01:48.900 --> 01:51.664
(German accent): It's all right.
Take what you want.

01:51.710 --> 01:53.234
I won't interfere.
I said on your knees!

01:53.280 --> 01:56.841
Okay.
I've been waiting a long time
for this.

01:56.880 --> 02:00.247
Oh, Gott. Sie denken...

02:00.280 --> 02:02.384
Please, this is all a mistake...

02:02.420 --> 02:03.409
Shut up!

02:03.450 --> 02:05.884
(yelling in German)

02:05.920 --> 02:08.286
(gunshots)

02:14.960 --> 02:17.861
(American accent):
Whoa, whoa, whoa, man.
It's cool. Take what you want!

02:29.850 --> 02:33.274
*

03:04.580 --> 03:05.604
Let's process the suitcase
in the guest room as evidence,

03:05.650 --> 03:07.572
all right? Thanks.

03:07.620 --> 03:11.408
(clears throat)

03:11.450 --> 03:13.350
Hey.

03:13.390 --> 03:15.415
Look who they pulled off
the bench.

03:15.460 --> 03:17.621
You said you had
something interesting.

03:17.660 --> 03:20.220
Missed you, too.

03:20.260 --> 03:22.865
Two male victims,
multiple gunshots to both.

03:22.900 --> 03:24.561
Shooter seems like a pro.

03:24.600 --> 03:26.465
Haven't found any
shell casings.

03:26.500 --> 03:29.469
And from the position
of this head shot,

03:29.510 --> 03:31.466
he had this one on his
knees, under control.

03:31.510 --> 03:33.535
But not that one. Maybe
lost control of him,

03:33.580 --> 03:36.504
maybe never had it.
The neighbors see
or hear anything?

03:36.550 --> 03:39.246
Cleaning lady found 'em
in the morning.

03:39.280 --> 03:41.578
Can I get the I.D.s? Thanks.

03:41.620 --> 03:43.747
One of them's named
Timothy Wagner.

03:43.790 --> 03:45.542
He's a bonds broker,
33 years old.

03:45.590 --> 03:47.558
He was the owner
of this apartment.

03:47.590 --> 03:49.558
Other one's
Otto Neuhaus.

03:49.590 --> 03:52.388
German citizen.
He lived in Hamburg.

03:52.430 --> 03:54.751
Looks like he was only
in town for a few days.

03:56.300 --> 03:58.325
They're identical.

03:58.370 --> 04:01.669
(sniffing)
Close. But not quite.

04:01.700 --> 04:05.329
Well, close enough that we
can't tell which one's which.

04:05.370 --> 04:06.473
Shooter must've gone
through their pockets

04:06.510 --> 04:07.670
after he
killed them.

04:07.710 --> 04:09.746
Their I.D.s were
out on the floor.

04:09.780 --> 04:11.407
Well, I'm gonna give you
the benefit of the doubt

04:11.450 --> 04:14.578
and say that you
just didn't look closely yet.

04:14.620 --> 04:16.781
This man and only this man reeks
of a German brand

04:16.820 --> 04:18.913
of cigarette
called Oberste.

04:18.950 --> 04:21.282
There are no indicators
that the occupant

04:21.320 --> 04:23.288
of this apartment smoked.
Ashtrays, lighters,

04:23.330 --> 04:26.822
odors in the upholstery.
This is Neuhaus.

04:26.860 --> 04:29.055
His hair has been
freshly cut and dyed.

04:29.100 --> 04:30.658
His glasses...

04:30.700 --> 04:33.362
have no prescription.

04:33.400 --> 04:36.608
He's even used
subtle contouring makeup

04:36.640 --> 04:38.835
to narrow the appearance
of his nose.

04:38.870 --> 04:40.974
All of this to make him look
more like Mr. Wagner

04:41.010 --> 04:42.875
than he already did.

04:42.910 --> 04:44.798
Why he did any of this
and what relation it has,

04:44.850 --> 04:48.547
if any, to his murder or that of
Mr. Wagner's remains to be seen.

04:48.580 --> 04:51.811
We've already reached out to the
next of kin to ID. the bodies.

04:51.850 --> 04:53.989
I'm confident they'll confirm
what I just said.

04:54.020 --> 04:56.011
Not betting against you
but we still have to go

04:56.060 --> 04:58.324
through the process.
It'll take some time

04:58.360 --> 05:00.021
for Neuhaus' family
to fly in from Hamburg,

05:00.060 --> 05:03.359
but Wagner's father
is meeting us at the morgue.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.867
I'll go with you. Maybe
he'll have some idea

05:04.900 --> 05:06.390
what happened here.

05:07.400 --> 05:10.437
Any of you ever had to do this?

05:10.470 --> 05:12.438
Identify a
loved one?

05:12.480 --> 05:14.471
No, we haven't.

05:14.510 --> 05:17.104
I can't even think straight.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.641
(crying)

05:19.680 --> 05:22.945
I can't tell the difference.

05:23.920 --> 05:25.888
Tim

05:25.920 --> 05:27.478
had a birthmark.

05:27.520 --> 05:29.056
On his right side.

05:55.520 --> 05:59.411
Mr. Wagner, had you heard
of Otto Neuhaus before today?

05:59.460 --> 06:01.758
No.

06:01.790 --> 06:04.554
Do you have any idea
how he and your son

06:04.590 --> 06:05.887
might have known
each other?

06:05.930 --> 06:10.594
Tim and I hadn't been close
for a while.

06:10.630 --> 06:12.996
I don't think I'd
seen him In a year.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.861
We're gonna collect DNA
samples from both Tim

06:15.900 --> 06:16.969
and Otto to compare

06:17.010 --> 06:18.500
for family markers,
but...

06:18.540 --> 06:20.508
maybe you can give
us a head start.

06:20.540 --> 06:23.509
To your knowledge, is there
any chance they were related?

06:23.550 --> 06:26.007
Maybe one of them found
the other because of that.

06:26.050 --> 06:28.018
I'm sorry.

06:28.050 --> 06:31.019
I can't even tell you that.

06:31.050 --> 06:33.553
Tim was adopted.

06:37.630 --> 06:39.928
...and follow up
with Prince Olaf's office.

06:39.960 --> 06:43.521
Make sure he received
the gift I sent him.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.561
Thank you.

06:47.570 --> 06:49.538
Was I expecting you?

06:49.570 --> 06:51.538
Not to my knowledge.
But I can't rule out

06:51.570 --> 06:53.879
your having foreseen it
via the black arts.

06:53.910 --> 06:55.798
Is there a problem?

06:56.850 --> 06:59.478
You're still here.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.215
It's my office.

07:01.250 --> 07:03.081
I'm talking about New York.

07:03.120 --> 07:04.712
The photograph in this paper.

07:04.750 --> 07:05.978
In it you
can see

07:06.020 --> 07:07.817
La Bonne Pause,

07:07.860 --> 07:09.725
a restaurant known
for Its patIo seatIng.

07:09.760 --> 07:11.625
Ordinarily at the time
this photograph was taken,

07:11.660 --> 07:14.094
that patio would be packed.
Here, it's deserted.

07:14.130 --> 07:16.519
La Bonne Pause is one
of your preferred venues

07:16.570 --> 07:18.458
for business meals,
and when that business is

07:18.500 --> 07:21.492
of a sensitive nature,
you buy it out for privacy.

07:21.540 --> 07:25.067
I'm unclear_
as to why my |IngerIng here

07:25.110 --> 07:27.203
is so troubling for you.

07:27.240 --> 07:30.209
You came here because you felt
compelled to offer me your help.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.639
I did you the courtesy
of accepting that help.

07:32.680 --> 07:35.478
Oh. You did that as a courtesy.

07:35.520 --> 07:37.943
I was under the impression
it was important to you.

07:39.090 --> 07:41.058
Not to say
I'm ungrateful.

07:41.090 --> 07:44.059
Are you waiting for the magic
words before you disappear?

07:44.090 --> 07:47.856
Because thank you.

07:47.900 --> 07:50.528
The work that I do requires
my complete mental faculty.

07:50.570 --> 07:52.060
Your presence here
is an irritant.

07:52.100 --> 07:54.933
_ It's a_burr _
In my cognItIve fabrIc.

07:54.970 --> 07:56.733
I had assumed that,
as with similar occasions

07:56.770 --> 07:59.500
in the past, you would take the
completion of our transaction

07:59.540 --> 08:01.770
as your cue to be on your way.

08:01.810 --> 08:04.677
If you must know,
I am still in New York

08:04.710 --> 08:07.019
because I'm working
on a project.

08:07.050 --> 08:10.247
Something of a puzzle--
it may take some time to solve.

08:10.290 --> 08:13.919
And when it's done,
I'll move on.

08:13.960 --> 08:15.655
Well, perhaps I can be
of assistance.

08:15.690 --> 08:17.578
Quite good with puzzles.

08:17.630 --> 08:19.928
You've known that
longer than anyone.

08:19.960 --> 08:22.155
You'll get the benefit
of my help,

08:22.200 --> 08:24.623
and I'll get
a father-free New York.

08:26.300 --> 08:28.860
A win for both of us.

08:28.900 --> 08:31.698
(indistinct police transmission)

08:31.740 --> 08:33.708
Watson.

08:33.740 --> 08:36.038
Oh, hey. Everything settled
with your father?

08:36.080 --> 08:38.048
It will be.
I'm gonna do some work for him.

08:38.080 --> 08:40.878
So I came as soon as I got
your text. Detective Bell?

08:40.920 --> 08:41.875
Bedroom.

08:41.920 --> 08:43.649
All right.

08:43.690 --> 08:46.250
And this apartment pertains
to our doppel-homicide how?

08:46.290 --> 08:49.259
The DNA test results came back
for Tim Wagner and Otto Neuhaus.

08:49.290 --> 08:51.850
They definitely
were not related. But Tim

08:51.890 --> 08:53.858
or someone who looked
like Tim withdrew

08:53.900 --> 08:56.698
a $100,000 cashier's check
from his bank account last week.

08:56.730 --> 08:58.789
As far as we know,
that money is gone.

08:58.830 --> 09:00.092
Now, I looked at both
victims' phones, and there's

09:00.140 --> 09:02.096
only one number
that appears on both call logs.

09:02.140 --> 09:04.859
It belongs
to a paralegal named Dorian...

09:04.910 --> 09:06.707
Dorian Moll.
And this is his apartment.

09:06.740 --> 09:09.174
I saw the name
on the mailbox downstairs.

09:09.210 --> 09:10.939
So,

09:10.980 --> 09:12.868
two dead look-alikes,
$100,000 in missing cash,

09:12.920 --> 09:14.615
and the individual
who was in touch with both

09:14.650 --> 09:16.140
and seems to have gone
to ground.

09:16.180 --> 09:17.579
Clothing gone from the closet.

09:17.620 --> 09:19.178
Computer cables but no laptop.

09:19.220 --> 09:21.609
Cell phone left behind
with its SIM card broken.

09:21.660 --> 09:24.083
The two of you are considering
the possibility

09:24.130 --> 09:25.882
_ he was involved
In an IdentIty scam?

09:25.930 --> 09:28.899
Honestly, we don't know
what he was involved in.

09:28.930 --> 09:31.660
Something back there
you should see.

09:35.670 --> 09:39.629
Could be some kind
of organized con operation,

09:39.680 --> 09:42.672
maybe some
kinky sex... thing.

09:42.710 --> 09:46.100
WATSON:
Whatever it was,
it was obviously bigger

09:46.150 --> 09:47.139
than just
Tim Wagner

09:47.180 --> 09:50.217
and Otto Neuhaus.

09:50.250 --> 09:52.810
CSU's sending an A-Run
to collect what's up there.

09:52.860 --> 09:55.249
The unis will hang back
for them.

09:55.290 --> 09:58.157
Will do.

09:58.190 --> 09:59.748
That was the captain.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.826
He got the search results
for Dorian Moll. No priors.

10:02.870 --> 10:05.259
His last known address was_ his
parents' house In Forest HIlls.

10:05.300 --> 10:06.699
Worth a visit, right?

10:06.740 --> 10:08.037
Even if he's
not there,

10:08.070 --> 10:10.038
they might know some friends
we can talk to.

10:10.070 --> 10:13.039
This is the, uh, apartment next
to the one we were just at.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.308
This is 2-D, yes?

10:14.340 --> 10:16.171
Sounds right.

10:17.380 --> 10:19.041
(dripping sounds)

10:20.320 --> 10:22.641
So, I noticed in the lobby
the mail was gathering

10:22.690 --> 10:24.988
for Apartment 2-D.
There's also delivery menus

10:25.020 --> 10:26.339
piling up
outside the front door.

10:26.390 --> 10:28.187
Well, if that person's
been away that long,

10:28.220 --> 10:30.654
they probably didn't
leave the AC on.

10:30.690 --> 10:32.180
The apartment
shares a fire escape

10:32.230 --> 10:33.891
with Dorian Moll's.

10:33.930 --> 10:35.158
If he's looking
for a place to hide

10:35.200 --> 10:37.862
and he knows his
neighbor's out of town...

10:37.900 --> 10:40.266
Hey, QUYS,
knock on 2D.

10:40.300 --> 10:42.063
And stay sharp.

10:42.100 --> 10:44.500
We think Moll
might be in there.

10:48.380 --> 10:49.904
(whispers):
Back away.

10:56.380 --> 10:59.759
Dorian Moll.
Police. Don't move.

10:59.790 --> 11:02.008
Do us all a favor-- keep your
hands where I can see 'em.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.025
All right, turn around.

11:15.370 --> 11:18.259
There's a look.

11:18.310 --> 11:19.902
I had to do this.

11:19.940 --> 11:22.329
_ It confuses
faCIal recognItIon sobeare.

11:22.380 --> 11:23.847
Computers can't
identify your face

11:23.880 --> 11:25.245
if they can't tell it's a face.

11:25.280 --> 11:26.474
You think_
someone's pursuIng you

11:26.510 --> 11:28.375
using facial
recognition software.

11:28.420 --> 11:31.344
Not someone.
Some company.

11:31.390 --> 11:33.381
They're trying to kill me.

11:39.130 --> 11:41.155
I'm sorry I tried to run, okay?
It's just...

11:41.200 --> 11:43.168
I don't know how deep
this thing goes.

11:43.200 --> 11:45.327
"This thing" being a
disagreement you're in

11:45.370 --> 11:47.964
with a company that makes
facial recognition sobeare?

11:48.000 --> 11:49.399
Countenance Technologies.

11:49.440 --> 11:51.101
They're the ones
who are after me.

11:51.140 --> 11:52.402
And they are so
all-seeing that you

11:52.440 --> 11:54.328
felt the need to adopt the guise

11:54.380 --> 11:56.029
of a clown from the future.

11:56.080 --> 11:57.445
Look, ER. is everywhere.

11:57.480 --> 11:59.812
Businesses ID. you
the second you walk in.

11:59.850 --> 12:01.772
Billboards can pick
which ads to show you.

12:01.820 --> 12:03.412
Churches use it
to track attendance.

12:03.450 --> 12:05.918
Yeah, Jesus saves.
Your data.

12:05.950 --> 12:07.918
How about we

12:07.960 --> 12:11.179
take things a little
bit slower? Now,

12:11.230 --> 12:13.892
good news is, you don't strike
us as a cold-blooded killer,

12:13.930 --> 12:16.296
but with two guys dead,
the way you tried to run,

12:16.330 --> 12:18.127
and all this?
You get why

12:18.170 --> 12:19.967
we're trying to understand
what's going on.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.798
Last year I created a site

12:22.840 --> 12:24.364
called DoppelHunt.com.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.537
I help people find people
that looked like them.

12:26.570 --> 12:28.902
Why?
People all over the world

12:28.940 --> 12:30.805
are putting pics of themselves
online every day.

12:30.850 --> 12:32.272
The technology's gotten so good
you really can

12:32.310 --> 12:34.517
find your own twin.
Remind me--

12:34.550 --> 12:36.415
is that how Peter did it
on The Brady Bunch?

12:37.450 --> 12:39.782
Behold, an infinity mirror

12:39.820 --> 12:41.811
of millennial narcissism.

12:43.090 --> 12:45.388
He seeks fame by
promising others

12:45.430 --> 12:48.149
they'll get to look
at themselves.

12:48.200 --> 12:50.418
So it says on your site here
that you take volunteers.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.392
Is that how Tim and Otto
got Involved?

12:52.430 --> 12:54.261
Yeah, Tim contacted me first

12:54.300 --> 12:56.234
and we used his picture
to find Otto.

12:56.270 --> 12:58.465
And this company you're worried
about-- Countenance--

12:58.510 --> 13:01.331
they provide
the, what, search program?

13:01.380 --> 13:03.439
I wouldn't say "provide".

13:03.480 --> 13:06.301
I-I came across a copy
and modded it

13:06.350 --> 13:08.045
to hunt
for lookalikes,

13:08.080 --> 13:10.844
and then I took some shots
at Countenance on the site.

13:10.890 --> 13:12.858
When I'd find a match
I'd upload the photos

13:12.890 --> 13:14.357
and prove how good the match was

13:14.390 --> 13:17.188
by showing that it could
fool their original software.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.323
Even it would confuse
one twin for the other.

13:19.360 --> 13:20.918
So first you
steal their sobeare

13:20.960 --> 13:22.427
and then you
embarrass them with it.

13:22.460 --> 13:24.564
Stick it to the man, right?

13:24.600 --> 13:26.488
Countenance sent me a cease
and deSIst letter, I posted that

13:26.530 --> 13:30.330
on the site and that's when
I really started to get hIts.

13:30.370 --> 13:32.463
Okay. Well, I get
why they'd be angry with you,

13:32.510 --> 13:34.330
but not enough
to commit murder.

13:34.380 --> 13:37.349
Couple of weeks ago
I'm walking home from the train

13:37.380 --> 13:39.348
and someone tried to mug me.

13:39.380 --> 13:41.348
He had on a mask,
he shoved me into a stairwell

13:41.380 --> 13:44.349
and pulled out a knife.
I kicked at him and got away.

13:44.390 --> 13:47.052
Did you file a police report?
I never saw his face,
so I figured what's the point?

13:47.090 --> 13:48.455
Then I heard
that Tim and Otto

13:48.490 --> 13:50.856
were dead, and I remembered.

13:50.890 --> 13:54.348
The guy who jumped me--
he never asked for my wallet.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.425
Why?
Because it wasn't a mugging.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.826
It was an assassination attempt.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.397
Countenance never
trIed to sue me.

14:02.440 --> 14:03.964
That would've
made it more public,

14:04.010 --> 14:05.466
and they just wanted it to end.

14:05.510 --> 14:08.138
F.R. is a billion-dollar
business and I proved

14:08.180 --> 14:09.477
that their software's flawed.

14:09.510 --> 14:11.603
Tell me that's not
a motIve for murder.

14:17.650 --> 14:19.288
So that was Marcus.

14:19.320 --> 14:21.550
The $100,000 check turned up.

14:21.590 --> 14:23.057
Do tell.

14:23.090 --> 14:25.388
Otto had mailed it
to himself back in Germany,

14:25.430 --> 14:27.159
probably to avoid
carrying it through customs.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.656
We still don't know
whether he stole it

14:28.700 --> 14:30.361
or Tim gave it to him.

14:30.400 --> 14:31.594
Mm.
Oh.

14:31.630 --> 14:34.463
I see Clyde likes
the food you made him.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.138
Yeah.
Or he just
appreciates his dinner date

14:36.170 --> 14:37.569
going the extra mile.

14:37.610 --> 14:39.976
Eh, close, but wrong
cold-blooded reptile.

14:40.010 --> 14:42.478
My dinner date is my father.
I can understand

14:42.510 --> 14:44.978
you confusing him with Clyde.
They could be doppelgangers.

14:45.010 --> 14:46.546
A car will be here
for me shortly.

14:46.580 --> 14:48.445
I'm meeting him
at a formal charity function.

14:48.480 --> 14:51.313
Malaria research or something.
He wasn't sure.

14:51.350 --> 14:53.489
Anyway, the point
is to sup with her.

14:53.520 --> 14:56.489
Donya Esfandiari.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.329
One of the richest
hoteliers in the world.

14:58.360 --> 15:01.090
She's currently building a
resort on the Pacific coast

15:01.130 --> 15:04.258
_ of Costa Rica.
SImultaneously, as It happens,

15:04.300 --> 15:07.098
the global energy firm
for which Father consults

15:07.140 --> 15:09.938
wishes to erect a
wmd farm nearby.

15:09.970 --> 15:11.528
Mrs. Esfandiari _
has won an InjunctIon

15:11.570 --> 15:14.403
against the wind farm, asserting
that it would impair her view.

15:14.440 --> 15:16.431
Now, Father thinks
she's willing to drop it

15:16.480 --> 15:19.449
given the right favors
in return.

15:19.480 --> 15:21.277
Huh.

15:21.320 --> 15:23.515
"Huh"?

15:23.550 --> 15:26.519
Well, between everything you
told me and meeting him myself,

15:26.550 --> 15:29.587
I just, you know, imagined him
doing heavier stuff.

15:29.620 --> 15:32.623
Seems a little, I don't know...
frivolous.

15:32.660 --> 15:35.595
Father's work is anything
but frivolous, I assure you.

15:35.630 --> 15:38.428
Thanks to him, this energy firm
and other clients like them

15:38.470 --> 15:41.030
have literally brought light
to lands that were dark and,

15:41.070 --> 15:43.561
just as often, rained darkness
where once there was light.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.635
Father doesn't distinguish.

15:45.670 --> 15:48.002
Perhaps you need sanctions
eased against a rogue nation

15:48.040 --> 15:49.598
so that you can
sell them your tanks

15:49.640 --> 15:52.507
or your factories can only spew
toxins

15:52.550 --> 15:54.518
if the US. doesn't sign
an emissions treaty.

15:54.550 --> 15:56.518
Father can make it so,

15:56.550 --> 15:58.438
with the moral neutrality
of the plague.

15:58.490 --> 16:00.515
Now that sounds
more like the guy I met.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.529
So if what he does
is so evil, then...

16:03.560 --> 16:06.449
Not evil. Neutral.
Like a shark or tsunami.

16:06.490 --> 16:08.253
Fine, distasteful.

16:08.300 --> 16:09.756
Then why are you
spending time with him?

16:09.800 --> 16:11.597
So that, ironically,
I can spend less.

16:11.630 --> 16:15.066
As soon as he closes this
negotIatIon, he WIII be gone.

16:15.100 --> 16:17.364
_ I'm to be a_nother_
par of eyes thIs evenIng.

16:17.410 --> 16:20.208
I'm to watch Mrs. Esfandiari--
observe her breathing,

16:20.240 --> 16:21.673
blink rate
and other nonverbals—-

16:21.710 --> 16:23.575
while she and Father talk.

16:23.610 --> 16:27.068
Unfortunately, it means
you and Detective Bell

16:27.120 --> 16:30.146
will have to visit Countenance
TechnologIes WIthout me.

16:30.190 --> 16:32.181
Wait, what?

16:33.820 --> 16:36.084
Countenance Technologies?
That's the company

16:36.120 --> 16:37.621
that Dorian Moll stole
that sobeare from.

16:37.660 --> 16:40.390
I thought you said that his
story sounded paranoid.

16:40.430 --> 16:43.319
I admit I initially thought
his tale was far-fetched.

16:43.370 --> 16:45.622
ButI looked into Countenance
all the same.

16:45.670 --> 16:47.262
To my surprise,

16:47.300 --> 16:49.564
there may be merit
to Dorian's belief

16:49.600 --> 16:51.602
that the company
was coming for him after all.

17:00.620 --> 17:05.387
Remind me to untag every picture
ever posted of me online.

17:06.620 --> 17:09.680
Detective Bell.
Ms. Watson.

17:09.720 --> 17:12.257
I'm Curtis Tofano.
You wanted to talk to me?

17:12.290 --> 17:14.793
Mr. Tofano, there was a
double-homicide in Tribeca

17:14.830 --> 17:16.695
the night before last.
Two men who looked

17:16.730 --> 17:19.062
a lot alike. It made the
news. Maybe you saw It?

17:19.100 --> 17:21.398
Uh, sorry.
Do you know
someone named

17:21.440 --> 17:24.534
Dorian Moll or have you
ever heard of DoppleHunt.com?

17:25.710 --> 17:27.678
Unfortunately, yeah.

17:27.710 --> 17:29.507
The two murder victims
met on his Web site.

17:29.540 --> 17:30.677
We know that your company
was pretty upset

17:30.710 --> 17:32.803
about what he was doing.

17:32.850 --> 17:35.614
Wait a second, you're not
suggesting that some...
No, I know. Even we

17:35.650 --> 17:37.242
didn't think you could've
cared that much,

17:37.290 --> 17:41.511
but then a colleague
of our noticed this.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.653
WATSON:
That's you, right?

17:43.690 --> 17:45.851
You participated
in a DoppelHunt,

17:45.890 --> 17:48.427
and you gave Dorian
a fake name when you did.

17:48.460 --> 17:51.099
So obviously you cared enough
to check him out.

17:51.130 --> 17:52.597
So can you
account

17:52.630 --> 17:54.393
for your whereabouts
two nights ago

17:54.440 --> 17:56.396
from 8:00 pm. on?

17:56.440 --> 17:59.603
Can we talk about this
In my ofﬁce?

17:59.640 --> 18:01.676
First of all, I was
in Cooperstown all week.

18:01.710 --> 18:03.598
I just got back last night.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.675
Cooperstown-- as in the
Baseball Hall of Fame?

18:05.710 --> 18:07.177
I went to college nearby.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.642
I go up every year
for induction.

18:08.680 --> 18:12.138
About 100 people saw me.
I was probably even on TV.

18:12.190 --> 18:14.658
Okay. Assuming that checks out,

18:14.690 --> 18:16.612
let's talk about Dorian Moll.

18:16.660 --> 18:18.719
The company sent you
to get intel on his site--

18:18.760 --> 18:20.227
maybe they were
willing to go further?

18:20.260 --> 18:21.852
You've got it all wrong.

18:21.900 --> 18:24.266
Nobody here was involved
in any murders.

18:25.600 --> 18:27.397
You're right
that my bosses asked me

18:27.440 --> 18:29.465
to perform a little
corporate espionage.

18:29.500 --> 18:31.502
Dorian had

18:31.540 --> 18:33.178
found a flaw in our program.

18:33.210 --> 18:34.677
He proved it could be fooled.

18:34.710 --> 18:37.679
We needed to find out what
he was up to so we could adapt.

18:37.710 --> 18:40.645
So you expressing interest in
a DoppelHunt was just a cover.

18:40.680 --> 18:42.819
It was a way for me to get into
Dorian's apartment

18:42.850 --> 18:44.818
and onto his Wi-Fi.
He stole from us.

18:44.850 --> 18:46.818
So we stole back.

18:46.850 --> 18:48.511
What exactly did you take?

18:48.560 --> 18:50.187
I downloaded all of his code

18:50.230 --> 18:51.686
and gave it to our guys
to analyze.

18:51.730 --> 18:54.722
They're fine-tuning
our algorithms as we speak.

18:54.760 --> 18:57.729
At the end of the day,

18:57.770 --> 19:00.261
Dorian forced us
to make a better product.

19:00.300 --> 19:01.665
That's it.

19:01.700 --> 19:05.261
And your bosses are gonna
tell it the same way?

19:06.610 --> 19:08.430
I can walk you
up the hall right now

19:08.480 --> 19:09.902
and you can talk
to whoever you like.

19:13.280 --> 19:14.770
(piano playing a soft tune)
Well, it certainly can't
hurt to have the local

19:14.820 --> 19:16.742
power station in
your debt, Donya.

19:16.780 --> 19:19.783
It would be an easy thing to
arrange a substantial discount.

19:19.820 --> 19:22.254
Tell me, Morland,

19:22.290 --> 19:25.828
do you still have friends
at the Panama Canal Authority?

19:25.860 --> 19:27.794
I count the chair among them.

19:27.830 --> 19:29.923
I will, of course, be importing

19:29.960 --> 19:32.929
Italian marble, French wines...

19:32.970 --> 19:35.393
The list is endless.

19:36.670 --> 19:39.537
Consider your shipments
expedited.

19:39.570 --> 19:41.731
(whispers)

19:43.510 --> 19:46.741
But we have to continue
after the presentatIons.

19:46.780 --> 19:48.475
Excuse me.

19:53.690 --> 19:55.658
Well,
she's hiding something.

19:55.690 --> 19:57.328
I'm aware.

19:57.360 --> 19:59.487
Ordinarily, when she smiles,
it's broad and genuine.

19:59.530 --> 20:01.293
Her crow's-feet support this.

20:01.330 --> 20:04.390
Tonight, every time she smiled,
it's been strained.

20:04.430 --> 20:07.866
This shouldn't
be as difficult as it is.

20:07.900 --> 20:09.993
She's expressed a
willingness to compromise,

20:10.040 --> 20:12.008
and the concern
about the view

20:12.040 --> 20:14.508
from her hotel is
obVIously a feInt.

20:14.540 --> 20:17.668
For whatever reason, she can't
simply say what she wants.

20:17.710 --> 20:20.508
Mm.

20:20.550 --> 20:21.847
Not drinking?

20:23.720 --> 20:25.938
I was under the impression
that I shouldn't.

20:25.990 --> 20:27.958
At least not in your presence.

20:27.990 --> 20:30.322
Well, as long as you don't
take your wine intravenously,

20:30.360 --> 20:32.828
I should be okay.

20:34.760 --> 20:36.819
Has it struck you that
this will be the first meal

20:36.860 --> 20:38.521
we've had together in decades?

20:38.570 --> 20:41.437
Well, you went out of your way
to make that so.

20:41.470 --> 20:44.462
Playing the victim
doesn't suit you, Sherlock.

20:47.410 --> 20:48.729
(piano continues)

20:48.780 --> 20:50.008
Well, she's comfortable now.

20:50.040 --> 20:51.940
*

20:54.750 --> 20:55.944
We're leaving.

21:00.490 --> 21:03.584
You've grown tempestuous
in your old age.

21:03.630 --> 21:05.757
Or is that you've bedded
the widow Esfandiari?

21:05.790 --> 21:07.496
I have not.

21:07.530 --> 21:09.054
This is not_ a tantrum
you're WItnessmg,

21:09.100 --> 21:10.795
it's clarity.

21:10.830 --> 21:12.889
You were right.

21:12.930 --> 21:15.069
Donya did seem quite comfortable
speaking with that man,

21:15.100 --> 21:18.433
as if they were close
friends, wouldn't you say?

21:18.470 --> 21:21.007
And this holds special
meaning to you because...?

21:21.040 --> 21:22.507
His brother-in-law

21:22.540 --> 21:24.007
is the president of Panama.

21:24.050 --> 21:26.439
It's safe to say
that he has contact

21:26.480 --> 21:28.345
with the Canal Authority.

21:28.380 --> 21:30.075
So she's asking for things
she doesn't need.

21:30.120 --> 21:31.849
She's stringing me along.

21:31.890 --> 21:33.517
She has no intention of ever
dropping the injunction.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.380
I need to find out why.

21:38.530 --> 21:40.088
I'm sorry we didn't make
more headway tonight.

21:40.130 --> 21:41.995
I'm afraid you'll have
to tolerate

21:42.030 --> 21:44.794
my presence in your city
a bit longer.

21:44.830 --> 21:46.695
(phone ringing)

21:46.730 --> 21:48.539
(vehicle departing)

21:48.570 --> 21:51.664
Watson, how went your meeting
at Countenance Technologies?

21:51.710 --> 21:53.405
The guy whose photo you found,
Curtis Tofano,

21:53.440 --> 21:55.328
he did do some spying on Dorian,

21:55.380 --> 21:58.372
but it doesn't look like
the company had anyone killed.

21:58.410 --> 21:59.900
Well, that's unfortunate.

21:59.950 --> 22:01.838
Yeah, listen, I'm calling
because the captain

22:01.880 --> 22:03.484
asked us to come down
to the station.

22:03.520 --> 22:05.010
Some guy named Evan Farrow
came in a little while ago,

22:05.050 --> 22:06.608
said he might have
some information

22:06.650 --> 22:09.050
about why Wagner and Neuhaus
were killed.

22:09.090 --> 22:10.955
"Might" have "some"
information.

22:10.990 --> 22:12.878
That doesn't sound like it
warrants a trIp across town.

22:16.830 --> 22:19.822
Trust me, I think we're going
to want to hear

22:19.870 --> 22:21.098
what he has to say.

22:21.140 --> 22:23.768
He looks just like
the victims.

22:29.110 --> 22:30.668
A few weeks ago,
I got an e-mail

22:30.710 --> 22:32.473
from this Web site,
DoppelHunt.com.

22:32.510 --> 22:34.842
They sent me pictures of a guy
who looks enough like me

22:34.880 --> 22:37.110
to be my twin--
Tim Wagner.

22:37.150 --> 22:39.038
The site put us in touch
with each other.

22:39.090 --> 22:40.580
At first we Skyped

22:40.620 --> 22:41.985
and it was fun.

22:42.020 --> 22:44.955
We both thought the whole thing
was pretty crazy.

22:44.990 --> 22:48.027
Then Tim suggested
that we get together.

22:48.060 --> 22:49.493
(wry chuckle)

22:49.530 --> 22:51.919
When we did, he admitted to me

22:51.970 --> 22:53.995
that he wanted my help
with something.

22:55.470 --> 22:57.938
He offered me ten grand
to go to a lab,

22:57.970 --> 22:59.801
tell them I was him,

22:59.840 --> 23:01.501
show them his driver's license,

23:01.540 --> 23:03.178
take some DNA test.

23:03.210 --> 23:05.747
Did he say what
the test was for?

23:05.780 --> 23:08.419
I figured it was
a paternity thing.

23:08.450 --> 23:11.419
When I asked him, he said he
wouldn't tell me anything more

23:11.450 --> 23:13.918
until I said I was on board.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.609
Obviously you
turned him down.

23:15.660 --> 23:17.548
I told him I didn't want
any part of it.

23:17.590 --> 23:19.421
And that was the
last time we talked.

23:20.830 --> 23:24.095
But then I saw on the news
that he and...

23:24.130 --> 23:28.430
another guy who looked like...

23:28.470 --> 23:32.907
him, us,
that they were murdered.

23:32.940 --> 23:35.079
I figured it had to be related.

23:35.110 --> 23:36.737
Didn't happen to mention
the name of the lab

23:36.780 --> 23:38.577
he wanted you to visit,
did he?

23:38.610 --> 23:40.749
Sorry.

23:40.780 --> 23:44.739
All he said
was it had to happen soon.

23:44.790 --> 23:47.088
(loud, rousing music playing)

23:47.120 --> 23:48.917
(loud music continues)

23:48.960 --> 23:51.087
MEN:
* To the tables
where our bottles meet *

23:51.130 --> 23:53.553
* And underneath them, too...

23:53.600 --> 23:56.956
I'm pretty sure that's supposed
to be a Peter Gabriel song.

23:57.000 --> 23:57.967
Never heard of him.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.820
(music stops)
This, Watson,

23:59.870 --> 24:04.000
is the official fraternity song
of Kappa Rho Pi,

24:04.040 --> 24:05.701
Oriskany Fall University
Chapter.

24:05.740 --> 24:08.675
Over 100 years old and still
making eardrums bleed.

24:08.710 --> 24:11.144
It is also the answer
to our questIons

24:11.180 --> 24:13.148
about Tim Wagner
and his lookalikes.

24:13.180 --> 24:16.217
Or at least,
the theory of an answer.

24:16.250 --> 24:18.639
Mm. Thanks.

24:18.690 --> 24:20.658
Last night I began
to explore possible reasons

24:20.690 --> 24:22.908
why Tim Wagner wanted
to dodge a DNA test.

24:22.960 --> 24:25.155
His second,
more scrupulous twin

24:25.190 --> 24:27.590
thought it was to do
with a paternity matter.

24:27.630 --> 24:29.052
I now believe Mr. Wagner

24:29.100 --> 24:31.193
wished to avoid
being charged with murder.

24:31.230 --> 24:34.028
If he was a suspect
in a murder investigation,

24:34.070 --> 24:36.061
Marcus would've caught it
days ago.

24:36.100 --> 24:38.034
Only if it was a federal case
or in the City of New York.

24:38.070 --> 24:39.765
Which is why I began to look
at other jurisdictions

24:39.810 --> 24:42.028
where Tim Wagner resided
in the past.

24:42.080 --> 24:44.708
Hey, what do monkeys
have to do with anything?

24:44.750 --> 24:47.105
They might be the key
to exercising my father

24:47.150 --> 24:48.242
from New York.

24:48.280 --> 24:50.043
I worked on multiple fronts
last night,

24:50.080 --> 24:51.286
including my father's
wind farm conundrum.

24:51.320 --> 24:55.188
These are the lower primates
I would like you to consider.

24:55.220 --> 24:58.929
Kappa Rho Pi,
Oriskany Falls University.

24:58.960 --> 25:01.224
Oh, there's Tim Wagner.

25:01.260 --> 25:04.297
OFU is an elite school set
in the typically quiet hamlet

25:04.330 --> 25:06.525
of Oriskany Falls, New York.

25:06.570 --> 25:09.038
Quiet, that is, except for
several middling drinking songs

25:09.070 --> 25:10.958
and one tragic event

25:11.010 --> 25:12.807
11 years ago.

25:12.840 --> 25:15.832
"Fraternity pledge goes missing
during rush week."

25:15.880 --> 25:17.108
Harold Cudlow
was pledging

25:17.140 --> 25:18.539
Kappa Rho Pi in 2004.

25:18.580 --> 25:20.810
His roommate said that Howard
was summoned

25:20.850 --> 25:22.977
by his would-be brothers
on November 5,

25:23.020 --> 25:25.545
presumably part of the hazing
that pledges are routinely

25:25.590 --> 25:27.148
subjected to.

25:27.190 --> 25:28.214
The police questioned
members of the fraternity

25:28.260 --> 25:29.215
in the days that followed...

25:29.260 --> 25:31.023
But they didn't have any proof
of foul play.

25:31.060 --> 25:32.254
They never found the body.

25:32.290 --> 25:34.690
Till six months ago.

25:34.730 --> 25:36.322
Construction
on a new student center

25:36.360 --> 25:38.828
was just undenNay in 2004.

25:38.870 --> 25:40.963
This spring, the pavement
was dug up for repairs

25:41.000 --> 25:44.265
and Howard Cudlow's remains
were found beneath the concrete.

25:44.310 --> 25:47.199
The M.E. identified broken bones
consistent with a fall,

25:47.240 --> 25:48.969
including a severed spine.

25:49.010 --> 25:51.240
The concrete helped preserve
parts of the body.

25:51.280 --> 25:53.271
_ As well as some rather
InterestIng DNA eVIdence.

25:53.310 --> 25:55.676
The fall didn't kill him,
you see.

25:56.880 --> 25:59.246
Someone strangled him.

25:59.290 --> 26:01.155
All right.
Well, thanks.

26:01.190 --> 26:03.988
Keep me posted.
All right.

26:04.030 --> 26:06.783
That was the chief of police
up in Oriskany Falls.

26:06.830 --> 26:09.594
You were right about them liking
Wagner for Cudlow's murder.

26:09.630 --> 26:12.963
And pursuant to that, they had
requested a DNA sample?

26:13.000 --> 26:17.369
Along with every other Kappa
Rho Pi frat brother from 2004,

26:17.400 --> 26:19.937
all voluntary.

26:19.970 --> 26:21.232
They didn't have grounds
to compel anyone.

26:21.280 --> 26:23.908
Everybody, except Wagner,
complied

26:23.950 --> 26:25.144
and was cleared.

26:25.180 --> 26:26.738
He knew the DNA found
on Cudlow was his

26:26.780 --> 26:28.077
so he dragged his feet

26:28.120 --> 26:29.678
while he searched
for a double

26:29.720 --> 26:31.244
who'd take the
test for him.

26:31.290 --> 26:32.917
Well, this changes things.

26:32.950 --> 26:34.281
Obviously we've uncovered
Tim Wagner's motive

26:34.320 --> 26:35.958
for twinning himself.

26:35.990 --> 26:37.389
It stands to reason
we've also uncovered

26:37.420 --> 26:39.684
the motive of the individual
who shot him to death.

26:39.730 --> 26:41.925
It was someone who wanted
revenge for Cudlow's murder.

26:41.960 --> 26:44.167
They came after Wagner
'cause he was acting guilty.

26:44.200 --> 26:47.124
That would suggest that they
knew Tim Wagner had failed

26:47.170 --> 26:48.296
to come forward
and was

26:48.340 --> 26:49.932
the only suspect to do so.

26:49.970 --> 26:51.801
You think it's someone
with inside knowledge.

26:51.840 --> 26:53.262
Someone who was

26:53.310 --> 26:55.278
working the investigation
in Oriskany Falls.

26:55.310 --> 26:57.039
When I was talking
to the chief there,

26:57.080 --> 26:59.173
I was thinking the same thing.

26:59.210 --> 27:00.768
I knew he was holding back
on me.

27:00.820 --> 27:02.845
I had to pull it out of him.

27:02.880 --> 27:06.748
Howard Cudlow's brother
is one of his cops.

27:08.090 --> 27:10.285
They're on the way to talk
to him now.

27:11.990 --> 27:14.151
(low, indistinct conversations)

27:14.200 --> 27:16.919
(phones ringing)

27:16.960 --> 27:19.758
Captain figures it'll be
at least a few hours

27:19.800 --> 27:22.234
before we get our crack
at Sean Cudlow.

27:22.270 --> 27:24.067
You can come back if you
want, but I got to say,

27:24.110 --> 27:25.930
it looks like we got our guy.

27:25.970 --> 27:27.267
All right,
I'll let Sherlock know.

27:27.310 --> 27:29.335
Am I crazy or did I just

27:29.380 --> 27:31.348
hear him speak in
perfect Spanish?

27:31.380 --> 27:33.109
Yeah, fluent in three dozen
languages,

27:33.150 --> 27:35.846
but the man has never seen
Say Anything.

27:37.080 --> 27:39.014
That's an '805 movie, right?

27:40.290 --> 27:42.087
You want me to punch you,
right?

27:47.860 --> 27:49.225
I have business
to attend to.

27:49.260 --> 27:50.966
More fun with wind farms.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.763
Was that a good call
or a bad one?

27:52.800 --> 27:54.688
Father should start
packing his bags.

28:01.280 --> 28:04.169
I hope the two of you
haven't been waiting long.

28:06.510 --> 28:08.444
We were well attended to.

28:08.480 --> 28:11.415
Oh, please.

28:12.920 --> 28:14.217
I was worried
something happened

28:14.260 --> 28:17.309
when you left so suddenly
the other night.

28:17.360 --> 28:18.987
Something did.

28:19.030 --> 28:22.056
I realized you were wasting
my time.

28:22.100 --> 28:23.158
Excuse me?

28:23.200 --> 28:24.360
You're not really worried

28:24.400 --> 28:26.391
about_a wind farm
affectIng the VIew

28:26.430 --> 28:28.830
from your hotel in Costa Rica.

28:28.870 --> 28:30.064
You feigned interest
in compromise

28:30.100 --> 28:32.204
so as not_to
arouse suspICIon.

28:32.240 --> 28:34.333
Once you and I simply failed
to reach a deal,

28:34.380 --> 28:37.235
no one would ever ask
the real reason

28:37.280 --> 28:39.168
you wanted the farm to go away.

28:39.210 --> 28:42.270
Do the words "mono titi" mean
anythIng to you?

28:42.320 --> 28:44.515
I'm afraid they do not.

28:44.550 --> 28:47.781
Well, it's what the
Costa Ricans call this animal.

28:47.820 --> 28:51.426
You might know it better as the
black crowned squirrel monkey.

28:51.460 --> 28:52.927
It's an endangered species

28:52.960 --> 28:55.190
native to that part
of Central America,

28:55.230 --> 28:56.322
protected by both
the Costa Rican government

28:56.360 --> 28:57.896
and international convention.

28:57.930 --> 28:59.261
Now, a squirrel monkey habitat

28:59.300 --> 29:01.131
was recently discovered

29:01.170 --> 29:04.037
and it partially overlaps
the area that you wish to build

29:04.070 --> 29:05.332
your resort.

29:05.370 --> 29:06.962
I'm shocked to hear this.

29:07.010 --> 29:08.978
I had no idea.

29:09.010 --> 29:10.375
I sincerely doubt that.

29:12.010 --> 29:14.149
My son looked into
the environmental

29:14.180 --> 29:15.977
impact study
done for your plans.

29:16.020 --> 29:18.147
He discovered that
the government

29:18.190 --> 29:19.782
biologist
who rubber-stamped them

29:19.820 --> 29:21.959
promptly left the country.

29:21.990 --> 29:23.355
If you're wondering
where someone flees to

29:23.390 --> 29:24.857
after accepting
a life-changing bribe

29:24.890 --> 29:26.289
when they already live
in Costa Rica,

29:26.330 --> 29:28.298
the answer is Switzerland.

29:28.330 --> 29:30.821
The habitat also occupies

29:30.870 --> 29:34.169
part of the space intended
for the wind farm.

29:34.200 --> 29:37.909
When my clients conduct
their environmental study,

29:37.940 --> 29:42.309
they will discover
the monkeys' habitat as well.

29:42.340 --> 29:45.468
_And its extension
Into your property.

29:46.910 --> 29:48.468
What is it you want?

29:48.520 --> 29:50.340
I want nothing.

29:51.590 --> 29:53.512
In fact,
I'm here to offer you a favor.

29:56.020 --> 29:58.887
My client...

29:58.930 --> 30:01.854
will publish this
press release in a hour.

30:01.900 --> 30:04.095
It's a pledge to revise
their plans for the wind farm

30:04.130 --> 30:08.430
in order to protect the black
crowned squirrel monkey.

30:08.470 --> 30:10.097
Of course, once word
of the habitat gets out,

30:10.140 --> 30:11.505
that will be the end
of your resort

30:11.540 --> 30:15.169
and an embarrassment
to you.

30:15.210 --> 30:19.340
But if you wish,
I could persuade my client

30:19.380 --> 30:22.417
to let you add your name
to the release,

30:22.450 --> 30:25.214
make the same pledge.

30:25.250 --> 30:28.185
You can be heroes together.

30:28.220 --> 30:31.451
The decision is yours.

30:33.290 --> 30:35.394
When Howie first went missing,

30:35.430 --> 30:37.227
we all knew what happened.

30:37.260 --> 30:40.423
Not the details,
but pretty much.

30:40.470 --> 30:42.938
Only nobody could do anything
about it.

30:44.340 --> 30:46.865
All the rich kids
just closed ranks.

30:46.910 --> 30:49.231
Kept their mouths shut.

30:49.280 --> 30:51.976
And the one who did it
just got away with it.

30:52.010 --> 30:53.978
He went on...

30:54.020 --> 30:56.443
got to have a life.

30:56.480 --> 30:58.914
Howie didn't.

31:00.350 --> 31:03.558
I became a cop
to see this through.

31:03.590 --> 31:08.459
To make sure the son of a bitch
who killed my brother paid.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.627
I'll take what's coming to me.

31:10.660 --> 31:14.437
You admit to killing Tim Wagner
and Otto Neuhaus?

31:14.470 --> 31:16.563
I only meant to get Wagner.

31:16.600 --> 31:20.229
But the other guy
looked so much like him.

31:20.270 --> 31:23.205
I still don't know
why he was there.

31:23.240 --> 31:25.470
We know that you do, Sean.

31:25.510 --> 31:26.977
BELL:
He was g0Ing to take
the DNA test

31:27.010 --> 31:28.511
for Wagner.

31:28.550 --> 31:30.370
Wagner found him on
DoppelHunt.com.

31:30.420 --> 31:32.479
That's why you wanted to hurt
Dorian Moll, right,

31:32.520 --> 31:34.351
because you thought
he was in on it?

31:34.390 --> 31:36.017
I-I don't know
what you're talkIng about.

31:36.060 --> 31:39.029
Dorian Moll? I've never
even heard that name before.

31:39.060 --> 31:40.584
GREGSON:
Guy in a ski mask

31:40.630 --> 31:42.552
attacked him
the night of the eighth.

31:42.600 --> 31:45.160
Tried to make it look
like a robbery gone bad.

31:45.200 --> 31:46.997
You think I'm the only guy

31:47.030 --> 31:50.033
to ever commit a crime
In a sh mask?

31:50.070 --> 31:52.402
The second guy, Neuhaus...

31:52.440 --> 31:55.637
if he was helping Wagner,
that's good.

31:55.680 --> 31:58.046
I feel less bad
about what happened.

31:58.080 --> 32:00.503
But... I'm telling you...

32:00.550 --> 32:03.212
I didn't come after anyone else.

32:03.250 --> 32:04.979
All right, can you tell us
where you were

32:05.020 --> 32:05.611
the night of the eighth?

32:05.650 --> 32:07.140
Yeah. On duty.

32:07.190 --> 32:08.589
Check my logs.

32:08.620 --> 32:10.679
I was working extra shifts
that week.

32:16.330 --> 32:18.594
Oh, hey. I didn't know
you were in here.

32:18.630 --> 32:21.269
I was gonna watch
a football game.

32:21.300 --> 32:23.439
It's Thursday.
Yeah.

32:23.470 --> 32:25.358
So, what were you doing?

32:25.410 --> 32:26.365
I'm thinking.

32:26.410 --> 32:28.173
Thinking about what?

32:28.210 --> 32:30.098
Sean Cudlow.

32:30.140 --> 32:32.301
His alibi for the night
of the eighth checks out.

32:32.350 --> 32:34.648
He's not the one
who made an attempt

32:34.680 --> 32:36.341
on Dorian Moll's life.

32:36.380 --> 32:38.314
(sighs): Well... maybe
there wasn't an attempt.

32:38.350 --> 32:41.319
I mean, Dorian thought it was
a real mugging-- maybe it was.

32:41.360 --> 32:43.316
You've been away from your phone
for 32 minutes.

32:43.360 --> 32:45.351
So what does that have to do...
You didn't see this
text from Marcus.

32:45.390 --> 32:47.995
Tim Wagner's DNA is not a match
for the skin

32:48.030 --> 32:50.191
recovered from beneath
Howard Cudlow's fingernails.

32:51.430 --> 32:53.227
Wait a second.
He didn't kill Cudlow?

32:53.270 --> 32:55.363
Obviously, he was there
the night of the murder.

32:55.400 --> 32:57.493
_ He was _so concerned it _
mIght be hIs genetIc materIal

32:57.540 --> 32:59.667
that he went to the trouble
of finding a doppelganger

32:59.710 --> 33:01.473
to take a DNA test for him.

33:01.510 --> 33:04.377
So he was an accessory--
someone else did the killing?

33:04.410 --> 33:06.503
That coupled
with Officer Cudlow's insistence

33:06.550 --> 33:08.609
he was not aware of Dorian Moll

33:08.650 --> 33:11.517
has left me with a rather
nasty taste In my mouth.

33:11.550 --> 33:13.347
We've missed something.

33:15.160 --> 33:16.752
Oriskany Falls University
had an enrollment

33:16.790 --> 33:19.554
of nearly 3,000 people in 2004.

33:19.590 --> 33:22.297
Perhaps we could attend
one of their reunions,

33:22.330 --> 33:24.389
make cheek swabs
a condition of entry.

33:24.430 --> 33:28.639
Oriskany Falls is
in Central New York, right?

33:28.670 --> 33:31.104
Last time I checked.
And the police there confirm

33:31.140 --> 33:34.268
that all the other members
of Kappa Rho Pi from 2004

33:34.310 --> 33:35.800
passed their DNA tests.

33:35.840 --> 33:36.670
Correct.

33:40.350 --> 33:41.544
Who are you calling?

33:41.580 --> 33:44.811
Marcus. I want him to ask the
Oriskany Falls Police Department

33:44.850 --> 33:47.080
for their original
list of suspects.

33:47.120 --> 33:48.587
I have a feeling Tim Wagner

33:48.620 --> 33:50.679
isn't the only name
we'll recognize.

34:01.700 --> 34:03.497
Mrs. Moll?

34:03.540 --> 34:06.668
I'm Detective Marcus Bell, NYPD.

34:06.710 --> 34:09.178
This is Detective Meadows.

34:09.210 --> 34:11.644
What did Dorian
do now?

34:11.680 --> 34:13.500
(door closes)

34:15.320 --> 34:17.538
How did you know I was here?

34:18.790 --> 34:21.418
Oh, your neighbor in 2-D
came back from vacation.

34:21.460 --> 34:23.553
Parents' place seemed
like the next best bet.

34:23.590 --> 34:26.252
I wanted to talk
to you agaIn

34:26.290 --> 34:27.518
about the night
you were attacked.

34:27.560 --> 34:29.824
Tell me you found the guy.
We think so.

34:29.860 --> 34:31.760
We're planning on sitting down
with him, but first,

34:31.800 --> 34:34.689
we were hoping you could put us
in touch with a friend of us.

34:37.500 --> 34:38.706
This is Mr. Holmes.

34:38.740 --> 34:40.503
You know Miss Watson
and Detective Bell.

34:40.540 --> 34:42.701
We just have a few
more I's to clot.

34:42.740 --> 34:45.300
It shouldn't
take too long.

34:45.350 --> 34:47.477
Uh, before you settle in,
would you mind

34:47.510 --> 34:48.716
showing us your shins?

34:48.750 --> 34:50.115
Excuse me?

34:50.150 --> 34:52.584
Your shins-- front parts
of your lower legs.

34:52.620 --> 34:54.349
(laughs softly)

35:01.360 --> 35:03.157
Your socks.

35:09.270 --> 35:11.534
Yeah, they look
about the right age,
a few weeks into healing.

35:11.570 --> 35:14.505
Dorian said he got one
or two good kicks in

35:14.540 --> 35:16.633
the night he
got jumped.
What are you talking about?

35:16.680 --> 35:17.533
I got these playing racquetball.

35:17.580 --> 35:18.672
I thought this stuff

35:18.710 --> 35:20.507
with Dorian was done, okay?

35:20.550 --> 35:23.576
If someone tried to hurt him,
you can't pin that on me.

35:23.620 --> 35:25.645
You're right. Sadly,
we cannot connect you

35:25.690 --> 35:27.715
to the attack
on Dorian Moll.

35:27.750 --> 35:30.787
It is quite likely, however,
that we can connect you

35:30.820 --> 35:32.822
to the murder
of Howard Cudlow.

35:32.860 --> 35:35.249
VVho?
WATSON: When we
visited your office,

35:35.300 --> 35:36.653
you said that
you went to school

35:36.700 --> 35:38.429
near Cooperstown.

35:38.470 --> 35:40.563
Oriskany Falls University,
right?

35:40.600 --> 35:41.669
Yeah. How'd you know that?

35:41.700 --> 35:43.190
You were there
the same tIme

35:43.240 --> 35:44.867
as Howard Cudlow
and Tim Wagner.

35:44.910 --> 35:47.538
It's funny you not mentioning
that when we talked to you

35:47.570 --> 35:49.709
about Mr. Wagner's
murder the other day.

35:49.740 --> 35:52.868
WATSON:
You pledged Kappa Rho Pi
the same year Howard did,

35:52.910 --> 35:55.174
but the school suspended
the frat's charter

35:55.220 --> 35:57.711
after he went missing,
so you never got to join.

35:57.750 --> 36:00.583
The Oriskany Falls police
talked to you in 2004,

36:00.620 --> 36:03.453
and then, after they found
the body six months ago,

36:03.490 --> 36:05.253
they asked you for your DNA.

36:05.290 --> 36:06.484
HOLMES:
By thIs tIme,

36:06.530 --> 36:07.929
Dor_ian Moll was
qUIte the thorn

36:07.960 --> 36:10.690
in your company's side--
awareness of his DoppelHunts,

36:10.730 --> 36:12.322
however,
gave you a way out.

36:12.370 --> 36:13.826
You approached him,
under an assumed name,

36:13.870 --> 36:15.735
and then he found
a double for you.

36:15.770 --> 36:18.603
You then paid that double
to take a DNA test for you.

36:18.640 --> 36:20.665
GREGSON:
We're also guessing
you're the one

36:20.710 --> 36:23.531
who told Tim Wagner
about Mr. Moll's Web site.

36:23.580 --> 36:27.641
Both of you were there
the night Howard Cudlow died.

36:27.680 --> 36:30.342
You knew if he was arrested
he could bring you down, too.

36:30.380 --> 36:32.610
HOLMES:
Surely, you and Mr. Wagner
knew that it was rislq

36:32.650 --> 36:35.357
using Dorian Moll's Web site
to find your doubles.

36:35.390 --> 36:37.756
But his modifications
to your company's software

36:37.790 --> 36:39.553
made the hunts possible, so...

36:39.590 --> 36:40.921
you found that risk
acceptable.

36:40.960 --> 36:42.689
WATSON: Then the site starting
getting more attention.

36:42.730 --> 36:45.619
You worried that people might
figure out what you had done.

36:45.670 --> 36:47.592
So you tried
to shut him down.

36:47.630 --> 36:48.767
Only your buddy
was having

36:48.800 --> 36:50.233
a harder time
finding a double

36:50.270 --> 36:51.532
to take the DNA test.

36:51.570 --> 36:53.504
First one said no,
and by the time

36:53.540 --> 36:55.633
you found Otto Neuhaus,
it was too late.

36:55.680 --> 36:57.978
Howard's brother already
had him in his sights.

36:58.010 --> 37:00.740
Dorian is a nut and a thief.

37:00.780 --> 37:02.714
You can't believe
a word he says.

37:02.750 --> 37:05.742
What about
Mitchell Newsome?

37:05.790 --> 37:08.884
Dorian helped put me in touch
with him this morning.

37:08.920 --> 37:10.888
He wasn't too excited
about gomg to jaII

37:10.920 --> 37:12.751
for hindering prosecution,
so he told us

37:12.790 --> 37:14.553
the story you told him

37:14.600 --> 37:16.488
to convince him to
take that DNA test.

37:16.530 --> 37:18.293
GREGSON: You and
Cudlow and a friend

37:18.330 --> 37:21.299
were trespassing
at a construction site.

37:21.340 --> 37:24.798
Your friend shoved Cudlow;
Cudlow fell.

37:24.840 --> 37:28.037
When your friend realized
that Cudlow's back was broken,

37:28.070 --> 37:30.630
he panicked
and finished him off.

37:30.680 --> 37:33.604
Obviously, the friend
that you referenced
was Tim Wagner.

37:33.650 --> 37:36.744
But it wasn't his skin
found beneath Howard
Cudlow's fingernails.

37:36.780 --> 37:37.815
It was yours.

37:37.850 --> 37:39.613
Now, you might argue
that's not enough

37:39.650 --> 37:42.312
to prove that you're the one
who strangled him, but...

37:42.360 --> 37:43.952
a jury might disagree.

37:43.990 --> 37:45.651
BELL: I've got two
presents for you

37:45.690 --> 37:47.920
from the Oriskany
Falls PD.

37:47.960 --> 37:49.552
One's a warrant.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.625
The other's a swab.

37:53.900 --> 37:56.937
(chuckles):
Yeah, that's right, Dorian,
it's done.

37:56.970 --> 37:59.734
You can go home now.

37:59.770 --> 38:03.001
Well... again,
that's a very kind offer,

38:03.040 --> 38:05.076
but no, thanks, we're good.

38:05.110 --> 38:06.646
You got it.

38:06.680 --> 38:07.749
Bye.

38:07.780 --> 38:09.441
Free DoppelHunts? Really?

38:09.480 --> 38:10.913
Shut up.

38:10.950 --> 38:13.043
For all of us. He promised
the experience would,

38:13.090 --> 38:15.809
and I quote,
"blow our freakin' minds."

38:15.860 --> 38:18.658
So in other words,
he hasn't learned one thing.

38:18.690 --> 38:20.055
(Bell chuckles)

38:20.090 --> 38:21.819
Could you imagine

38:21.860 --> 38:23.953
two of your partner?

38:27.470 --> 38:28.960
*

38:29.000 --> 38:31.036
(mechanical whirring)

38:34.040 --> 38:36.008
(whirring)

38:41.050 --> 38:42.472
(sighs)

38:42.520 --> 38:44.385
(whirring)

38:44.420 --> 38:47.048
(doorbell rings)

38:58.930 --> 39:00.989
Come to say good-bye?

39:01.030 --> 39:03.760
May I come in?

39:12.580 --> 39:14.514
(lock clacks)

39:19.420 --> 39:23.015
I wanted you to know that
I have wired a commission

39:23.060 --> 39:25.927
to your account for your
services this past week.

39:25.960 --> 39:27.120
Well, that was unnecessary.

39:27.160 --> 39:27.854
It's done.

39:27.890 --> 39:29.596
Give it to charity
if you like.

39:29.630 --> 39:31.427
Give it to Joan.

39:31.470 --> 39:34.735
I know it doesn't
matter to you.

39:34.770 --> 39:37.432
I wish I knew what
you did want.

39:39.010 --> 39:42.776
I came because I'd_|ike
to make a confeSSIon.

39:42.810 --> 39:44.471
Well, I would dial
the authorities for you,

39:44.510 --> 39:45.807
but I wouldn't know which ones.

39:47.550 --> 39:50.075
The work I've been doing
in New York this past week--

39:50.120 --> 39:54.910
the business with Donya--
could just as easily have
been handled elsewhere.

39:54.960 --> 39:57.155
You mean another city.

39:57.190 --> 39:59.078
You caught me by surprise

39:59.130 --> 40:01.496
when you came to my
office the other day

40:01.530 --> 40:03.691
and you asked why
I was still here.

40:03.730 --> 40:05.095
And my predicament with her

40:05.130 --> 40:07.963
was the first thing
that came to mind.

40:09.170 --> 40:10.990
Truth is...

40:11.040 --> 40:13.600
I've lingered
because of you.

40:13.640 --> 40:15.972
You need a kidney.

40:16.010 --> 40:18.171
Or bone marrow.
Or do you want

40:18.210 --> 40:20.144
_ a front-row seat _
In case I relapse agaIn?

40:20.180 --> 40:23.047
That's enough,
Shenock!Enough!

40:29.220 --> 40:31.654
I know why you hate me.

40:31.690 --> 40:34.079
But the past
is the past.

40:34.130 --> 40:36.121
I wish to move forward.

40:36.160 --> 40:38.128
How do you plan on doing that?

40:38.160 --> 40:41.960
Well, for one thing,
I'll be staying in
New York indefinitely.

40:42.000 --> 40:45.208
You've been through trauma.
I wish to be close by

40:45.240 --> 40:47.458
in case I can be of
further aSSIstance.

40:47.510 --> 40:50.070
So now you wish to parent me?

40:50.110 --> 40:52.078
You know yourself, Sherlock.

40:52.110 --> 40:55.011
You know who you are,
you know who you were.

40:55.050 --> 40:57.871
Ask yourself...

40:57.920 --> 41:00.582
when you were a boy, could
anyone have parented you?

41:00.620 --> 41:02.087
I can think of one person.

41:07.590 --> 41:10.093
If she were here...

41:10.130 --> 41:13.622
what do you suppose
she would want us to do?

41:19.640 --> 41:22.768
The world is as wretched
a place as It's ever been.

41:22.810 --> 41:25.244
A sad fact, but a boon
to my particular business.

41:25.280 --> 41:28.613
I'll have no shortage
of work to tend to

41:28.650 --> 41:30.811
while I'm here.

41:32.290 --> 41:33.643
And perhaps...

41:33.690 --> 41:36.511
before all is
said and done...

41:36.560 --> 41:38.619
we'll collaborate again.
