01:38.682 --> 01:40.601
Do you swear by the gods

01:41.268 --> 01:44.354
to loyally serve the Senate
and the people of Rome?

01:45.397 --> 01:48.567
I swear by the gods
to loyally serve the Senate...

01:48.650 --> 01:51.820
<i>After forming the Triumvirate
with Pompey and Crassus,</i>

01:53.363 --> 01:55.574
<i>Julius Caesar is elected consul,</i>

01:56.742 --> 01:59.578
<i>the most powerful position
in the Roman Republic.</i>

02:07.002 --> 02:09.713
<i>He rules an area
of a million square miles,</i>

02:11.256 --> 02:14.676
<i>and commands an army
of 150,000 men.</i>

02:20.515 --> 02:22.059
<i>For the former foot soldier,</i>

02:23.810 --> 02:26.355
<i>it's the crowning achievement
of his young career.</i>

02:30.442 --> 02:33.278
<i>Now, Caesar's first order of business</i>

02:33.904 --> 02:36.615
<i>is to repay the men
who brought him to power</i>

02:37.491 --> 02:40.243
<i>by passing their legislation
through the Senate.</i>

02:45.457 --> 02:50.337
It is in the interest of the Republic
to compensate the men who protect it.

02:50.796 --> 02:53.006
It is our procedures
that protect the Republic.

02:53.090 --> 02:55.217
Without them, we wouldn't be a republic.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.302
Without an army,
we wouldn't be anything at all!

02:57.386 --> 03:00.180
This legislation has been delayed
long enough.

03:00.263 --> 03:03.141
We are simply not in a position
to approve these allocations.

03:03.767 --> 03:07.312
It would be irresponsible
to rush their distribution.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.108
I move we postpone the vote.

03:13.735 --> 03:15.028
We are not postponing.

03:15.153 --> 03:16.655
That is up to the Senate.

03:22.244 --> 03:25.288
All those in favor of postponing the vote?

03:31.002 --> 03:33.171
With no other bills on the day's agenda,

03:33.755 --> 03:35.757
this session is hereby adjourned.

03:44.099 --> 03:46.017
Pompey and Crassus wanted Caesar

03:46.101 --> 03:48.854
to be consul because it would serve
their own interests.

03:50.814 --> 03:52.816
Part of the problem, of course, was that

03:53.525 --> 03:55.527
Caesar's measures themselves
were unpopular.

03:56.486 --> 03:59.614
Everyone could see that he was doing them
for Pompey and for Crassus.

04:01.575 --> 04:02.409
I'll fix it.

04:03.410 --> 04:05.495
- How?
- I'll figure it out.

04:05.579 --> 04:09.040
Will you? Forgive me if I don't have
much confidence.

04:09.166 --> 04:10.125
I'll get it done.

04:10.709 --> 04:12.711
- If you can't...
- I said I'll figure it out.

04:32.939 --> 04:37.110
<i>If Caesar can't get the Senate
to pass Pompey and Crassus' legislation,</i>

04:38.361 --> 04:40.864
<i>he could lose his position
as consul of Rome.</i>

04:44.910 --> 04:47.829
<i>So he takes matters into his own hands.</i>

05:02.636 --> 05:03.929
<i>With the use of street thugs,</i>

05:05.180 --> 05:07.349
<i>Caesar sends a message of intimidation.</i>

05:09.518 --> 05:11.853
<i>Targeting all the senators
who opposed him.</i>

05:18.151 --> 05:20.320
<i>Making it clear that at the next vote,</i>

05:21.488 --> 05:22.864
<i>things will be different.</i>

05:27.994 --> 05:30.247
Those who support this bill

05:30.705 --> 05:32.666
will be friends of the Republic.

05:35.168 --> 05:39.548
Any who oppose this bill,
oppose the good of Rome itself.

05:41.883 --> 05:43.093
All those in favor?

06:02.737 --> 06:03.989
The vote is unanimous.

06:08.076 --> 06:11.079
Caesar's resort to heavy-handed tactics

06:11.288 --> 06:14.791
had a negative impact
on his reputation in Rome.

06:15.625 --> 06:18.962
His political rivals now saw him

06:19.045 --> 06:22.465
as not merely a politician
who disagreed with them,

06:22.549 --> 06:24.676
but a dangerous person.

06:24.926 --> 06:28.555
Someone who would resort to anything
in order to get ahead.

06:38.857 --> 06:41.026
<i>Caesaer's strong arm tactics work</i>

06:41.610 --> 06:44.362
<i>and the Senate pass
the Triumvirate's legislation,</i>

06:46.323 --> 06:49.159
<i>including generous tax cuts for Crassus</i>

06:50.035 --> 06:52.662
<i>and the allocation of land
for Pompey's soldiers.</i>

06:54.080 --> 06:57.083
Crassus, Pompey and Caesar
are so powerful

06:57.459 --> 06:59.878
that if they agree what they want
to get done,

07:00.045 --> 07:01.421
they can get anything done.

07:01.504 --> 07:04.215
They can force whatever they want
through the Senate.

07:10.138 --> 07:13.683
<i>The three become partners
in several of Crassus' businesses.</i>

07:14.893 --> 07:16.978
<i>And for the first time in his adult life,</i>

07:18.396 --> 07:19.898
<i>Caesar is a rich man.</i>

07:22.859 --> 07:27.072
For an allianceÂ among three
deeply unsavory individuals,

07:27.155 --> 07:30.659
the Triumvirate proved
actually remarkably stable.

07:31.117 --> 07:33.244
They had been massively successful,

07:33.787 --> 07:35.288
and were enormously wealthy.

07:45.674 --> 07:50.053
<i>As consul, Caesar increases
his wealth a hundred times over,</i>

07:50.887 --> 07:53.890
<i>putting him in the upper echelons
of Roman society.</i>

07:55.308 --> 07:57.143
<i>He buys a lavish palace,</i>

07:57.435 --> 07:59.604
<i>throws extravagant parties,</i>

08:00.105 --> 08:02.232
<i>and can have any woman he desires.</i>

08:04.526 --> 08:05.360
Hello.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.657
<i>He begins an affair
with a married aristocrat</i>

08:10.740 --> 08:12.409
<i>who's well-connected in Rome.</i>

08:13.326 --> 08:15.620
<i>Her name is Servilia.</i>

08:18.540 --> 08:20.917
When we look at
the Roman Republic

08:21.251 --> 08:24.838
we can see a number of women
who were major power players.

08:24.963 --> 08:28.299
They've got wealth, they've got power,
they've got connections.

08:29.300 --> 08:30.969
Servilia is one of these.

09:05.086 --> 09:06.087
What's your name?

09:07.380 --> 09:08.339
Brutus.

09:11.843 --> 09:13.428
You look just like your father.

09:22.687 --> 09:24.439
<i>While the Triumvirate become rich,</i>

09:26.399 --> 09:29.652
<i>Caesar's use of violence
turn the entire Senate against him.</i>

09:32.113 --> 09:35.450
<i>And because Pompey and Crassus
are worried about their own careers,</i>

09:36.701 --> 09:39.287
<i>they decide Caesar must be replaced.</i>

09:44.084 --> 09:45.376
This is working.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.253
So why change it?

09:48.421 --> 09:50.048
You've made too many enemies.

09:50.131 --> 09:51.382
I have done what I needed to do.

09:51.466 --> 09:53.760
And you got what you wanted.
You were a consul.

09:56.805 --> 09:57.972
You still need me.

10:01.726 --> 10:02.560
For what?

10:06.523 --> 10:09.275
I have fulfilled my end of the bargain.

10:14.030 --> 10:17.075
I'll make sure that you're appointed
a governorship.

10:19.494 --> 10:21.329
I'll even let you choose the province.

10:45.687 --> 10:47.564
Pompey is giving me a governorship.

10:48.648 --> 10:49.774
Congratulations.

10:51.818 --> 10:52.861
You knew about this?

10:56.948 --> 10:58.116
Why didn't you warn me?

10:58.825 --> 11:01.077
Actually, Pompey and I agree on this.

11:03.079 --> 11:05.707
I'm passing your legislation.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.834
I'm protecting your interests.

11:08.334 --> 11:09.502
You owe me!

11:11.129 --> 11:12.755
This isn't personal.

11:13.506 --> 11:14.591
It's just business.

11:22.098 --> 11:23.933
Caesar had won the consulship

11:24.017 --> 11:26.186
that he had been aiming after
for his entire life,

11:26.352 --> 11:28.730
but he was planning on that being
the beginning of his career,

11:28.813 --> 11:30.148
not the end of his career.

11:33.443 --> 11:35.320
He had major plans for himself.

11:46.247 --> 11:48.416
They made it sound
like they were doing me a favor.

11:48.499 --> 11:50.043
Of course they did.

11:50.126 --> 11:52.045
They could have gotten me a second term.

11:52.253 --> 11:53.671
We could have pushed it through.

11:54.005 --> 11:55.965
And what would that have gained them?

11:56.716 --> 11:58.176
They know what they're doing.

11:59.010 --> 12:00.345
They want you out of Rome.

12:02.388 --> 12:03.348
Well, I'm not going.

12:05.266 --> 12:07.727
Where did Crassus make his fortunes?

12:09.520 --> 12:11.397
Where did Pompey win his armies?

12:14.692 --> 12:17.028
There's a lot of opportunity
in the provinces.

12:19.447 --> 12:20.949
Take advantage of it.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.788
Servilia is one
of the most fascinating women,

12:26.871 --> 12:30.083
not just of the age of Caesar,
but of the entire Roman Republic.

12:31.125 --> 12:33.044
Across several decades,

12:33.336 --> 12:36.005
she is probably the most important

12:36.089 --> 12:39.217
backchannel politician
that Rome had to offer.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.227
<i>With his role as consul ending,</i>

12:50.311 --> 12:54.399
<i>Caesar realizes there is only one way
to save his political career.</i>

12:57.151 --> 13:00.071
<i>He must become a conqueror.</i>

13:01.489 --> 13:04.450
<i>To do that, Caesar will need an army.</i>

13:06.911 --> 13:09.414
What Caesar wanted for himself

13:09.497 --> 13:14.294
was to go out and be governor
of some province in the Roman Republic

13:14.585 --> 13:17.880
that would allow him
control of some armies

13:17.964 --> 13:19.716
so that he could then go off and conquer

13:19.799 --> 13:22.552
some additional territory
for the Republic.

13:24.804 --> 13:28.308
<i>Caesar picks a province
on the northern edge of the Republic</i>

13:28.516 --> 13:32.937
<i>that borders the one territory
that no Roman general has ever conquered,</i>

13:33.563 --> 13:35.773
<i>known as Gaul.</i>

13:41.029 --> 13:43.656
<i>Over 200,000 square miles,</i>

13:44.532 --> 13:48.328
<i>Gaul comprises the territory
of modern-day France and Belgium,</i>

13:49.495 --> 13:52.957
<i>as well as parts of Switzerland,
the Netherlands, and Germany.</i>

13:56.127 --> 14:00.048
<i>The Gauls are considered Rome's
most dangerous threat in the region.</i>

14:09.474 --> 14:11.476
<i>To keep them from invading,</i>

14:12.435 --> 14:15.271
<i>there are four Roman legions
patrolling the border.</i>

14:21.527 --> 14:27.283
The Romans had long had
a deep psychological fear of the Gauls

14:27.784 --> 14:30.620
because one of the most traumatic events
in the history of Rome

14:30.703 --> 14:32.914
is shortly after the founding
of the Republic.

14:34.415 --> 14:37.126
A Gallic army came down
and actually sacked Rome.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.382
So, the Romans themselves
were always a little bit afraid

14:42.465 --> 14:43.716
of the long-haired barbarians.

14:47.095 --> 14:49.013
<i>If Caesar can conquer Gaul,</i>

14:49.514 --> 14:51.140
<i>he'll return home a hero</i>

14:51.933 --> 14:55.103
<i>and reclaim his place
as one of Rome's most powerful men.</i>

14:56.979 --> 14:58.064
<i>But if he fails,</i>

14:58.981 --> 15:02.652
<i>he'll either die in Gaul
or be charged with treason</i>

15:02.944 --> 15:06.030
<i>for invading a foreign land
without the Senate's approval.</i>

15:06.447 --> 15:08.699
<i>A crime punishable by death.</i>

15:19.502 --> 15:21.129
<i>In 58 B.C.,</i>

15:21.712 --> 15:25.174
<i>Julius Caesar and his four legions
of 20,000 men</i>

15:25.925 --> 15:28.428
<i>cross the border and invade Gaul.</i>

15:30.012 --> 15:32.890
Caesar had no authority to invade Gaul.

15:32.974 --> 15:34.725
He does so off his own back.

15:35.601 --> 15:38.062
He ignores the Senate,
and of course that shows

15:38.146 --> 15:39.981
how ambitious Caesar was.

15:40.857 --> 15:44.861
He was not going to be held back
by a few political rules

15:44.944 --> 15:47.738
in his search for power and glory.

15:52.034 --> 15:55.663
<i>The Gauls are made up of tribes
scattered throughout the region.</i>

16:00.168 --> 16:04.589
<i>Caesar's plan is to attack them,
one by one, before they can unite.</i>

16:06.507 --> 16:07.675
Push forward!

16:14.557 --> 16:19.187
<i>Moving quickly, CaesarÂ and
his men claim a string of early victories,</i>

16:20.104 --> 16:22.356
<i>allowing him to push deeper
into the region.</i>

16:25.151 --> 16:26.819
Caesar's conquest of Gaul

16:26.903 --> 16:30.281
is one of the all-time great examples
of divide and conquer.

16:31.824 --> 16:34.869
He never had to face
a unified Gallic army, like,

16:34.952 --> 16:38.498
"Oh, the Romans are coming to invade us,
we must join together and stop them."

16:38.581 --> 16:41.876
He was always able to do it piecemeal,
bit by bit.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.294
Spread out!

17:04.106 --> 17:05.942
<i>To stay on the offensive,</i>

17:06.901 --> 17:09.111
<i>Caesar makes an unprecedented move.</i>

17:13.366 --> 17:15.952
<i>He abandons the Roman supply lines,</i>

17:16.868 --> 17:19.829
<i>forcing his army
to live off the land they conquer.</i>

17:21.332 --> 17:24.585
He wasn't running out of supply lines
that were coming back from Italy.

17:24.669 --> 17:28.965
He was taking local food, local water,
local wine.

17:31.342 --> 17:34.845
We can trace along the river
using the tree line to mask our movements.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.223
What if we cross through the plains?

17:37.348 --> 17:38.224
It's more direct.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.601
And the high grass can provide cover.

17:41.018 --> 17:43.604
It's drier terrain. We can move faster.

17:45.231 --> 17:47.233
That's the route. Mark it.

17:52.863 --> 17:54.448
<i>With each encounter,</i>

17:55.408 --> 17:57.451
<i>Caesar levels his opponents.</i>

18:07.461 --> 18:08.588
Protect the flanks!

18:09.839 --> 18:11.632
<i>And by 56 B.C.,</i>

18:12.633 --> 18:15.303
<i>he has conquered most
of present day France.</i>

18:26.522 --> 18:28.065
<i>As the victories mount up,</i>

18:29.734 --> 18:33.195
<i>Caesar begins sending word
of his conquests back to Rome</i>

18:34.030 --> 18:38.284
<i>in a series of reports
known as the Gallic Commentaries.</i>

18:39.869 --> 18:41.954
Caesar writes his own history

18:42.580 --> 18:48.252
and it describes him in the third person
to make them appear neutral and objective.

18:49.253 --> 18:51.797
They were designed, though,
really to be read back in Rome

18:51.881 --> 18:56.052
and to appeal to his supporters
and the Roman people.

19:00.723 --> 19:03.267
<i>When the reports make their way
through the Republic</i>

19:03.809 --> 19:06.687
<i>the Roman people see Caesar as a hero.</i>

19:08.814 --> 19:11.609
The Romans were introducedÂ firsthand

19:11.692 --> 19:13.986
to this new territory
that they had conquered,

19:14.070 --> 19:17.156
this new world that seemed on the edge

19:17.239 --> 19:19.158
of barbarism and civilization,

19:19.241 --> 19:22.620
all of which had been brought
before them now by Caesar.

19:26.540 --> 19:29.543
<i>As Caesar's popularity
increases with the people,</i>

19:30.544 --> 19:33.381
<i>other soldiers are inspired
to come join the fight.</i>

19:48.020 --> 19:51.190
<i>One of the new arrivals
is a rising cavalry officer</i>

19:52.942 --> 19:54.777
<i>named Mark Antony.</i>

19:59.949 --> 20:02.868
Mark Antony was a young noble

20:03.285 --> 20:07.581
who at the time of the Gallic wars
was just starting to emerge himself.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.922
When Antony showed up
in the legions in Gaul,

20:15.005 --> 20:18.509
as a young cavalry officer,
Caesar liked what he saw.

20:19.301 --> 20:22.012
His infantry is here, here, and here.

20:22.805 --> 20:25.057
He'll try to divide our ranks
or surround us.

20:26.892 --> 20:30.521
Take two cohorts from the 10th
and use them to shore up our flanks.

20:30.604 --> 20:31.439
Good.

20:35.443 --> 20:37.319
<i>Over the next three years,</i>

20:38.112 --> 20:41.991
<i>Caesar defeats several tribes
along the eastern and western borders</i>

20:43.534 --> 20:45.286
<i>and continues moving north.</i>

20:48.664 --> 20:53.127
Caesar was driven
by almost uncontrollable ambition.

20:53.753 --> 20:57.298
He still wasn't satisfied
with what he had achieved,

20:57.590 --> 20:59.091
he still wanted more.

21:02.303 --> 21:05.055
<i>Caesar even moves beyond
the borders of Gaul,</i>

21:05.347 --> 21:07.808
<i>ordering troops into Germania and Britain,</i>

21:09.101 --> 21:12.188
<i>going further than any Roman conqueror
before him.</i>

21:20.362 --> 21:22.072
You underestimated him.

21:23.032 --> 21:24.325
We both did.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.076
There's no denying.

21:26.827 --> 21:29.121
It's an accomplishment. Conquering Gaul.

21:29.538 --> 21:30.998
Invading Gaul.

21:32.041 --> 21:33.501
He's yet to conquer anything.

21:34.919 --> 21:39.173
If he returns as a conqueror,
with his own army, his own fortune...

21:39.256 --> 21:42.426
Sooner or later he'll make a mistake,
and get himself killed.

21:44.136 --> 21:45.513
It's only a matter of time.

21:49.225 --> 21:51.393
We should have never sent him away.

21:58.442 --> 22:02.696
Pompey and Crassus see Caesar's popularity
as a direct threat

22:03.197 --> 22:07.368
that Caesar is now perhaps more powerful
than the rest of them.

22:08.410 --> 22:12.915
And in that position,
he can do increasingly what he wants.

22:15.876 --> 22:17.253
What are you smiling about?

22:36.897 --> 22:39.066
<i>Envious of Caesar's success,</i>

22:40.442 --> 22:43.571
<i>Crassus decides he needs
a military victory of his own...</i>

22:46.991 --> 22:52.079
<i>and sets off for the Middle East
to conquer the kingdom of Parthia.</i>

22:53.747 --> 22:56.834
Crassus' long-standing ambition,

22:57.543 --> 23:01.755
the missing piece from his entire career
is a great military victory.

23:02.923 --> 23:05.593
He had been allied with Caesar
for a long time

23:05.801 --> 23:08.262
and so, now he was watching

23:08.345 --> 23:12.182
not just his rival Pompey outdo him
in terms of military success,

23:12.266 --> 23:14.143
but now Caesar is out conquering Gaul.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.854
Crassus still has nothing to show for it.

23:23.527 --> 23:26.447
<i>As Crassus looks for glory
in the Middle East,</i>

23:27.907 --> 23:30.409
<i>Caesar continues his conquest of Gaul.</i>

23:32.870 --> 23:38.751
<i>And by 53 B.C., he controls nearly
150,000 square miles of land.</i>

23:41.629 --> 23:44.673
<i>There's just one area,
near the town of Gergovia,</i>

23:44.965 --> 23:46.550
<i>he still needs to conquer.</i>

25:24.356 --> 25:27.317
Go! After them!

25:52.426 --> 25:54.762
<i>For the first time
since invading Gaul,</i>

25:56.513 --> 25:59.600
<i>Caesar and his soldiers suffer
a massive defeat,</i>

26:00.768 --> 26:02.352
<i>losing 700 men</i>

26:04.271 --> 26:06.356
<i>at the hands of a ruthless general</i>

26:07.316 --> 26:08.984
<i>named Vercingetorix.</i>

26:21.622 --> 26:23.749
<i>Much of Caesar's success in Gaul</i>

26:23.832 --> 26:27.461
<i>has been due to the many tribes
who have no unified leader.</i>

26:29.588 --> 26:32.758
<i>That changes with the emergence
of Vercingetorix.</i>

26:34.510 --> 26:38.055
Vercingetorix was a Gallic chieftain

26:38.138 --> 26:42.601
who had been watching Caesar's conquest
of Gaul withÂ growing alarm

26:43.519 --> 26:47.564
and watching the tribes
individually picked off by the legions.

26:48.732 --> 26:51.568
The stakes for the Gauls
could not have been higher.

26:53.320 --> 26:54.822
Caesar's forces are on the move.

26:57.324 --> 26:58.742
Have they changed course?

26:59.159 --> 27:02.454
No, they're still heading due north,
towards the town of Quincy.

27:05.207 --> 27:07.417
<i>Outnumbered more than
two to one,</i>

27:08.043 --> 27:12.256
<i>Vercingetorix knows if he has any hope
of defeating Caesar's forces</i>

27:13.006 --> 27:14.341
<i>he'll need more men.</i>

27:18.387 --> 27:21.223
<i>So he sends scouts to any remaining tribes</i>

27:21.932 --> 27:24.560
<i>to convince them to help fight the Romans.</i>

27:26.728 --> 27:28.438
There was no unified Gallic state.

27:28.522 --> 27:32.234
It was a bunch of tribes and they would
battle with each other constantly.

27:33.777 --> 27:38.240
Vercingetorix wants to form
a pan-Gallic confederacy

27:39.408 --> 27:42.327
to oppose further Roman expansion.

27:50.127 --> 27:52.379
<i>While he waits for reinforcements,</i>

27:53.005 --> 27:56.967
<i>Vercingetorix must also find a way
to slow down the Roman army.</i>

27:58.886 --> 28:04.600
Vercingetorix's great insight
into how to defeat the legions

28:04.683 --> 28:08.437
was that Caesar had always been
living off the land.

28:09.771 --> 28:12.816
If Vercingetorix could isolate Caesar

28:12.900 --> 28:15.485
from those provisions that he had
always counted on,

28:15.694 --> 28:20.616
then he could very quickly turn
what appeared to be a very strong army

28:20.699 --> 28:21.825
into a very weak army.

28:25.120 --> 28:26.496
- Are you prepared to do it?
- I am.

28:38.342 --> 28:41.970
<i>Vercingetorix launches
a scorched earth campaign,</i>

28:42.721 --> 28:44.514
<i>destroying valuable resources</i>

28:45.849 --> 28:47.267
<i>for both the Romans</i>

28:49.353 --> 28:50.562
<i>and his own men.</i>

28:54.191 --> 28:57.986
The idea was,
"If we can endure this for a year,

28:58.779 --> 29:00.906
maybe we can get the Romans out of here."

29:20.342 --> 29:23.178
<i>The Gauls gather
all the rations they can find</i>

29:23.428 --> 29:26.807
<i>and retreat to a small town called Alesia</i>

29:27.516 --> 29:29.476
<i>where they await Caesar's next move.</i>

29:37.985 --> 29:41.905
Quincy's gone. Grain stores
completely destroyed, along with firewood.

29:42.489 --> 29:44.825
Same for Argenton. And Villate.

29:45.534 --> 29:47.536
Only Bourges remains intact, for now.

29:48.996 --> 29:50.497
What if we push through to Lutetia?

29:51.123 --> 29:52.958
How? We don't have the provisions.

29:53.166 --> 29:55.961
Then we reroute. We still have the south.

29:56.211 --> 29:58.338
If we turn back,
it'll be seen as weakness.

29:58.880 --> 30:01.383
It's just a resupply.
I don't see another option.

30:01.967 --> 30:03.343
The men will make do.

30:03.802 --> 30:06.179
The men can't march, or fight,
without food.

30:09.016 --> 30:10.183
We keep moving forward.

30:11.768 --> 30:12.602
Is that clear?

30:28.035 --> 30:29.911
<i>With supplies running out,</i>

30:31.955 --> 30:33.790
<i>Caesar comes up with a plan</i>

30:34.583 --> 30:38.712
<i>to turn Vercingetorix's ruthless strategy
against him.</i>

30:51.808 --> 30:55.771
<i>Knowing the Gauls are suffering
the same food shortages as his own army,</i>

30:56.521 --> 31:01.068
<i>Caesar orders his men to build
a massive wall outside Alesia</i>

31:02.694 --> 31:05.864
<i>to trap Vercingetorix
and his troops inside.</i>

31:08.116 --> 31:11.995
Caesar was incredibly ruthless
when he needed to be.

31:12.412 --> 31:16.249
Knowing that supplies inside the city
were running low,

31:16.958 --> 31:20.170
Caesar decided that he would be able
to starve them out

31:20.712 --> 31:24.549
by circumnavigating the city in a wall.

31:28.804 --> 31:31.473
<i>The wall stretches for 11 miles,</i>

31:33.642 --> 31:36.853
<i>effectively cutting the town off
from supply lines.</i>

31:45.278 --> 31:48.281
<i>Caesar knows that with no access
to food and water,</i>

31:48.740 --> 31:52.327
<i>it's only a matter of time
before Vercingetorix and his men</i>

31:52.661 --> 31:54.413
<i>are forced to surrender...</i>

31:55.914 --> 31:57.165
<i>or die from starvation.</i>

32:06.842 --> 32:08.718
<i>Over 2,000 miles away...</i>

32:15.517 --> 32:18.353
<i>Crassus's own military conquest in Parthia</i>

32:20.313 --> 32:22.065
<i>is a colossal failure.</i>

32:28.280 --> 32:30.740
<i>20,000 Romans lay dead</i>

32:32.325 --> 32:34.327
<i>and Crassus is taken captive.</i>

32:35.745 --> 32:36.621
What do you want?

32:37.330 --> 32:39.040
Tell me! Just, please! Money?

32:39.749 --> 32:40.584
Land?

32:40.792 --> 32:42.210
Oh god. Please, no.

32:42.586 --> 32:46.006
You don't understand. I can give you
anything you want, anything...

32:53.472 --> 32:54.764
Enough, please!

33:13.200 --> 33:15.869
<i>Just two months
after arriving in Parthia,</i>

33:16.453 --> 33:20.373
<i>Crassus, and his quest for glory,
come to an end.</i>

33:23.251 --> 33:24.961
Despite Crassus' desire

33:25.045 --> 33:28.340
to have a fantastic military victory
over in Parthia,

33:28.673 --> 33:31.843
it ended up being one of the most
spectacular defeats of all time.

33:33.929 --> 33:37.849
Crassus died by having molten gold
poured down his throat

33:37.933 --> 33:41.561
in mockery of his love ofÂ money
and his notorious greed.

33:47.234 --> 33:48.818
I swear by the gods,

33:49.277 --> 33:51.780
to loyally serve the Senate
and the people of Rome.

33:53.031 --> 33:55.450
<i>With Crassus dead
and Caesar in Gaul,</i>

33:57.494 --> 33:59.079
<i>Pompey makes his own move.</i>

34:00.997 --> 34:02.290
<i>He runs for consul,</i>

34:03.333 --> 34:05.710
<i>winning easily, with no opposition.</i>

34:07.712 --> 34:10.172
To defend and uphold the laws
of the Republic,

34:10.257 --> 34:12.926
for as long as I shall serve.

34:13.342 --> 34:17.931
I hereby name you, Pompey Magnus,
Consul of Rome.

34:23.228 --> 34:26.731
Pompey becomes
more and more friendly to the Senate

34:26.815 --> 34:30.110
because he sees that Caesar
is trying to bypass

34:30.193 --> 34:32.445
all of its traditional authority.

34:34.281 --> 34:38.284
Pompey is received everywhere
with these tumultuous welcomes

34:39.369 --> 34:45.083
and he feels that he is really the most
powerful and popular politician in Rome.

35:12.902 --> 35:13.945
It's from Rome.

35:17.032 --> 35:17.907
What does it say?

35:20.660 --> 35:22.495
Crassus was killed in Parthia.

35:25.040 --> 35:25.874
And...

35:26.958 --> 35:27.792
And what?

35:31.338 --> 35:32.797
Pompey's been elected consul.

35:41.306 --> 35:42.891
The death of Crassus

35:42.974 --> 35:45.685
is the beginning of the end
of the Triumvirate.

35:48.021 --> 35:53.401
It works as long as there's three
centers of power balancing each other.

35:53.735 --> 35:55.278
Now that Crassus is dead

35:55.362 --> 35:58.031
and it just comes down
to Caesar and Pompey,

35:58.448 --> 36:02.827
that leads naturally to them pulling
in opposite directions.

36:06.581 --> 36:08.541
<i>With the Triumvirate all but shattered,</i>

36:09.876 --> 36:13.046
<i>Caesar's future rests solely
on the outcome in Gaul.</i>

36:19.928 --> 36:23.515
<i>But even as they're trapped behind a wall,
close to starvation,</i>

36:24.808 --> 36:27.310
<i>Vercingetorix refuses to surrender,</i>

36:30.647 --> 36:33.358
<i>hoping that either reinforcements arrive</i>

36:33.858 --> 36:36.986
<i>or that the Romans run out of food
before they do.</i>

36:41.032 --> 36:41.866
How long?

36:42.909 --> 36:43.910
A week at most.

36:45.203 --> 36:46.579
If we stick to the rations.

36:51.918 --> 36:53.586
Cut the rations by a fifth.

36:54.337 --> 36:56.005
May buy us a day. Maybe more.

36:56.423 --> 36:57.257
Sir...

36:58.883 --> 37:00.677
the men are on the verge of revolt.

37:02.095 --> 37:04.055
Some are talking about surrender.

37:05.140 --> 37:06.224
They're hungry.

37:06.474 --> 37:07.809
Do you think that matters?

37:10.103 --> 37:12.939
Do you think Caesar cares
if we're hungry?

37:15.942 --> 37:17.610
Reinforcements aren't coming.

37:19.946 --> 37:21.865
Then what do you suggest that we do?

37:23.908 --> 37:24.743
Surrender?

37:26.828 --> 37:28.496
We will wait as long as it takes.

37:29.038 --> 37:30.415
Cut the rations by a fifth.

37:36.921 --> 37:39.674
<i>As Vercingetorix prepares
for the worst,</i>

37:42.510 --> 37:47.724
<i>Caesar learns that a massive army,
of 250,000 Gauls,</i>

37:47.807 --> 37:50.477
<i>is heading directly for Alesia.</i>

37:52.061 --> 37:55.231
Vercingetorix succeeds where others
had failed

37:55.648 --> 38:00.028
and he brings a large coalition
of Gauls together,

38:00.111 --> 38:02.155
to try to drive the Roman enemy out.

38:03.031 --> 38:06.659
Caesar was so threatening
to the established order in Gaul

38:06.743 --> 38:09.746
that Gauls were willing
to put their bygones behind them,

38:09.829 --> 38:12.457
and unite under Vercingetorix's rule.

38:15.001 --> 38:17.420
<i>With hordes of Gauls
heading his way,</i>

38:17.921 --> 38:19.672
<i>Caesar does the unthinkable.</i>

38:22.634 --> 38:24.344
<i>He builds another wall.</i>

38:25.553 --> 38:29.224
So he devises this option,
which is crazy,

38:29.307 --> 38:31.810
and which nobody probably
would have thought

38:31.893 --> 38:33.686
was even remotely plausible.

38:34.646 --> 38:36.481
Which is, he built a second wall.

38:37.190 --> 38:40.902
So the legions,
their whole world collapsed

38:41.277 --> 38:43.446
to the couple of hundred yards

38:43.530 --> 38:46.491
between the wall that separated them
from Alesia,

38:47.408 --> 38:51.913
and then the wall that separated them
from the relief army that was coming.

39:05.218 --> 39:06.344
How much longer?

39:07.971 --> 39:10.265
We're nearly finished reinforcing
the outer barrier.

39:10.557 --> 39:12.559
Maybe a day, day and a half at most.

39:15.728 --> 39:17.730
I want it done by sundown.

39:38.751 --> 39:41.421
<i>Just days after completing
tshe outer wall,</i>

39:43.214 --> 39:45.967
<i>Vercingetorix's reinforcements arrive</i>

39:48.845 --> 39:51.472
<i>with even more men than Caesar expected.</i>

39:59.564 --> 40:00.857
<i>For Vercingetorix,</i>

40:01.733 --> 40:03.401
<i>the time to fight...</i>

40:03.735 --> 40:04.736
<i>is now.</i>

40:08.197 --> 40:09.490
Look around you!

40:11.117 --> 40:13.202
There's men from every tribe,

40:14.787 --> 40:16.706
every part of Gaul!

40:20.877 --> 40:23.588
The Romans, they've raided our towns!

40:26.257 --> 40:28.092
They've killed our brothers,

40:29.177 --> 40:30.970
raped our wives!

40:33.264 --> 40:37.644
Caesar, he will regret ever stepping foot
in our lands!

40:39.228 --> 40:42.690
We will slaughter him and his men!

40:43.900 --> 40:46.527
We will rip the flesh from their bones

40:47.195 --> 40:51.032
and we will drink their fucking blood!

41:10.468 --> 41:11.386
Do you hear that?

41:13.137 --> 41:13.972
Listen.

41:16.015 --> 41:16.849
Listen!

41:20.853 --> 41:21.771
They're desperate.

41:23.815 --> 41:25.441
But do not underestimate them.

41:26.818 --> 41:28.861
They want to kill every last one of you.

41:32.532 --> 41:34.158
But I will not let that happen.

41:36.536 --> 41:38.162
We've come too far.

41:39.872 --> 41:41.290
We've fought too hard,

41:41.916 --> 41:43.835
for too long, to fail now!

41:45.128 --> 41:46.879
We are soldiers of Rome!

41:49.257 --> 41:51.259
And we have conquered half the world.

41:52.885 --> 41:54.721
And we will conquer Gaul.

41:58.933 --> 42:00.393
We will stand our ground!

42:02.228 --> 42:03.730
We will defend this wall!

42:05.106 --> 42:07.859
And we will go home conquerors!

42:27.712 --> 42:31.174
<i>Julius Caesar faces an attack
from two sides</i>

42:32.550 --> 42:36.095
