WEBVTT

00:06.174 --> 00:06.307
.

00:06.340 --> 00:07.241
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:07.875 --> 00:09.543
sexually based offenses

00:09.577 --> 00:11.379
are considered
especially heinous.

00:11.412 --> 00:13.647
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:13.681 --> 00:15.649
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:15.683 --> 00:17.185
are members of an elite squad

00:17.218 --> 00:19.253
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.287 --> 00:22.056
These are their stories.

00:22.356 --> 00:23.757
- What more can you tell us

00:23.791 --> 00:27.428
about your investigation
into Dr. West?

00:27.461 --> 00:29.630
- The first patient I spoke to,

00:29.663 --> 00:34.168
a ten-year-old boy,
uh, named Sammy Price,

00:34.202 --> 00:37.171
disclosed that
Dr. West had performed

00:37.205 --> 00:41.275
oral sex on him
in his pediatric office

00:41.309 --> 00:43.544
over the span of two years.

00:43.577 --> 00:45.746
- Once you had this disclosure
from the first patient,

00:45.779 --> 00:47.448
what was your next step?

00:47.481 --> 00:51.452
- To determine if Dr. West had
molested any other children.

00:51.485 --> 00:53.287
- Where did this investigation
lead you?

00:53.321 --> 00:57.158
- My squad interviewed
15 patients in all,

00:57.191 --> 00:59.527
and two other boys disclosed

00:59.560 --> 01:03.831
that Dr. West had performed
oral sex on them as well:

01:03.864 --> 01:07.201
Hector Ramos and Tommy Roberts.

01:07.235 --> 01:09.570
- Based on your conversation
with the boys,

01:09.603 --> 01:11.139
were you able to discern

01:11.172 --> 01:13.174
how Dr. West manipulated them
into submission?

01:13.207 --> 01:15.876
- He had a playroom
that was stocked with,

01:15.909 --> 01:18.846
sports equipment,
videogames,

01:18.879 --> 01:22.316
uh, remote control cars,
you name it.

01:22.350 --> 01:25.453
While the parents sat
in the waiting room,

01:25.486 --> 01:28.722
Dr. West escorted the boys
into this playroom,

01:28.756 --> 01:31.425
and he locked the door.

01:34.495 --> 01:36.230
This must be
torture for them.

01:36.264 --> 01:39.300
- Thank God it's almost over.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.137
- Oh, not since
the DA's office cleared me

01:43.171 --> 01:44.472
of child abuse charges.

01:44.505 --> 01:47.141
I mean, he's left
a few voicemails,

01:47.175 --> 01:48.676
but I just haven't
been able to--

01:48.709 --> 01:50.611
- No, no, I don't blame you.

01:50.644 --> 01:52.613
- Hey, Liv. Hi, Amanda.

01:52.646 --> 01:53.881
- Yeah.
- Hey.

01:53.914 --> 01:55.483
How's my new boss
doing in there?

01:55.516 --> 01:57.785
- Pretty good, considering
he only got the case

01:57.818 --> 01:59.220
from Barba two weeks ago.

01:59.253 --> 02:00.621
- All right,
time to go put the final nail

02:00.654 --> 02:02.290
in this creep's coffin.
- Mm.

02:02.323 --> 02:04.525
- It's good to see you, Liv.

02:08.229 --> 02:09.763
The Special Victims Unit
gathered

02:09.797 --> 02:12.366
a substantial amount of
evidence against Dr. West.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.435
The case was then advanced
to the DA's office,

02:14.468 --> 02:16.237
where I'm an investigator.

02:16.270 --> 02:18.172
I re-interviewed
all three boys.

02:18.206 --> 02:19.473
- Did any new information
come to light?

02:19.507 --> 02:20.941
- Yeah.
Uh, Sammy Price revealed to us

02:20.974 --> 02:23.311
that Dr. West had
threatened to kill him

02:23.344 --> 02:24.645
and his entire family

02:24.678 --> 02:26.647
if Sammy told anybody
what was going on

02:26.680 --> 02:28.182
down at Dr. West's playroom.

02:28.216 --> 02:29.917
- Nothing further.

02:29.950 --> 02:31.419
- You used to work undercover

02:31.452 --> 02:32.820
in Narcotics,
Detective Cassidy?

02:32.853 --> 02:34.388
- Yeah, sometimes.

02:34.422 --> 02:37.591
- Objection.

02:37.625 --> 02:39.960
- Goes to credibility
and bias, Your Honor.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.295
- I'll allow it.

02:41.329 --> 02:42.663
- Carissa Gibson
was a prostitute,

02:42.696 --> 02:45.333
whom you had a sexual
relationship with

02:45.366 --> 02:47.768
while you were undercover, hm?

02:54.375 --> 02:56.344
- Yeah.
- Mm.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.446
And, um, what happened to her

02:58.479 --> 03:01.782
during the course of,
uh, that investigation?

03:01.815 --> 03:03.984
- Um...

03:04.017 --> 03:05.886
she was murdered.

03:05.919 --> 03:08.422
- Heather Riggs,
another prostitute,

03:08.456 --> 03:10.758
she accused you of rape.

03:11.592 --> 03:13.294
- Come on, I was cleared
of all these charges.

03:13.327 --> 03:15.263
Do you wanna ask me a question

03:15.296 --> 03:17.865
that actually has to do
with this case?

03:17.898 --> 03:20.468
- Sure. Here's one.

03:20.501 --> 03:22.703
When you went
to arrest my client,

03:22.736 --> 03:25.806
did he have a swollen face
and a black eye?

03:25.839 --> 03:26.974
- He resisted.

03:27.007 --> 03:28.476
- So you smashed his face
into a desk

03:28.509 --> 03:30.244
and you called him a monkey?

03:30.278 --> 03:31.679
- That's a lie!

03:31.712 --> 03:33.981
- But you do admit
you violently subdued him?

03:34.014 --> 03:35.816
- Yeah, he was trying
to get away!

03:35.849 --> 03:37.685
- Because you are
a loose cannon

03:37.718 --> 03:39.753
that cannot control
his animal instincts.

03:39.787 --> 03:42.923
- Actually, the only animal
in this courtroom, Counselor,

03:42.956 --> 03:44.725
is your client, Dr. West.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.727
- So all black men
are animals to you?

03:46.760 --> 03:48.562
- Oh, come on,
this is such garbage.

03:48.596 --> 03:52.266
- And you felt justified
to take out your rage on him?

03:54.368 --> 03:57.371
- Detective...

03:57.405 --> 03:58.872
- After what he did
to those three boys...

03:58.906 --> 04:02.443
- Detective, sit down!

04:02.476 --> 04:05.012
He's lucky I didn't put him
in a goddamn body bag.

04:05.045 --> 04:06.614
- Detective, sit down!

04:06.647 --> 04:08.749
- I move for an immediate
mistrial, Your Honor.

04:08.782 --> 04:11.419
This witness's allusions
to other alleged victims

04:11.452 --> 04:13.020
is prejudicial!
- The jury can be instructed

04:13.053 --> 04:15.022
to disregard that portion
of his testimony.

04:15.055 --> 04:17.391
- Too loud a bell
to un-ring, Mr. Stone.

04:17.425 --> 04:18.892
Motion for a mistrial
is granted.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.060
- Yes!

04:20.093 --> 04:21.829
- You should know better,
Detective.

04:21.862 --> 04:23.063
The jury is dismissed.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.532
- Thank you so much,
Your Honor.

04:24.565 --> 04:26.634
- I also move that bail be set.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.636
- Your Honor, the facts of
this case have not changed.

04:28.669 --> 04:30.571
- No, on the contrary,
Your Honor,

04:30.604 --> 04:32.673
Detective Cassidy's outburst
has tainted the people's case.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.475
Do we expect Dr. West
to rot in jail

04:34.508 --> 04:35.709
while they try
and pick up the pieces?

04:35.743 --> 04:37.611
- I'll re-try this case
tomorrow, 9:30.

04:37.645 --> 04:39.547
- We both know
that's not going to happen.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.449
Bail is reduced to $50,000.

04:41.482 --> 04:44.452
- Praise the Lord.

04:44.485 --> 04:45.886
- Wait, he gets to
walk away from me

04:45.919 --> 04:48.556
after what he did to my son?
- Sit down! Bailiff!

04:48.589 --> 04:50.023
Order in this courtroom!

04:50.057 --> 04:51.925
Shame on you!
- Get him out of here.

04:51.959 --> 04:54.928
- Shame on all of you!
- Clear the courtroom.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.064
*

04:57.097 --> 04:59.800
- Let's go.
- Amanda...

04:59.833 --> 05:04.372
*

05:04.405 --> 05:06.940
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

05:06.974 --> 05:09.443
*

05:09.477 --> 05:11.078
I'm sorry.

05:11.111 --> 05:13.581
*

06:01.595 --> 06:01.762
.

06:01.795 --> 06:02.796
- In one fell swoop,
you jeopardize our entire case.

06:04.565 --> 06:05.966
- He was attacking me up there.
- That's his job.

06:05.999 --> 06:07.501
He baited you, and you
handled it like a rookie.

06:07.535 --> 06:08.636
- Yeah, well,
you could've objected.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.639
Your less than immaculate
personnel profile is fair game.

06:11.672 --> 06:12.673
You know what...

06:12.706 --> 06:15.042
consider yourself suspended
until further notice.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.477
Huh?

06:16.510 --> 06:17.678
- Cassidy, why don't
you wait outside?

06:17.711 --> 06:19.447
Go outside.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.181
- Yeah, whatever.

06:23.150 --> 06:25.586
- I have,
and normally he's money.

06:25.619 --> 06:26.987
- Well, you'd never
be able to tell that

06:27.020 --> 06:28.556
from his performance today.

06:28.589 --> 06:30.057
I can't believe
I let Jack McCoy

06:30.090 --> 06:32.192
talk me into
taking this job.

06:33.794 --> 06:35.529
- Something came up
after my father died,

06:35.563 --> 06:37.531
and I didn't see it coming.

06:37.565 --> 06:40.033
- Look, we need to make sure
that these families know

06:40.067 --> 06:42.836
that we are not
giving up on them.

06:45.973 --> 06:48.676
[drawers rattle,
cutlery clatters]

06:48.709 --> 06:51.679
- I can't believe
this happened.

06:51.712 --> 06:53.146
Felix, please!

06:53.180 --> 06:55.015
- Hector, sweetie,
you wanna show me

06:55.048 --> 06:57.585
those Transformers
that you got for Christmas?

06:57.618 --> 06:58.786
- Okay.

07:02.856 --> 07:05.626
- I know you're both upset.
We are too.

07:05.659 --> 07:07.695
- Well, thanks to
your big mouth detective,

07:07.728 --> 07:09.830
that son of a bitch
is walking free.

07:09.863 --> 07:12.500
- How can the judge
just let him go?

07:12.533 --> 07:13.834
- Mistrials happen.

07:13.867 --> 07:16.537
They're rare,
but there will be a new trial.

07:16.570 --> 07:19.640
- Hopefully in a few months.

07:19.673 --> 07:22.743
- Hector has to testify
all over again?

07:22.776 --> 07:23.711
- I'm afraid so.

07:23.744 --> 07:27.047
- West's lawyer made my son
look like a liar.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.483
He cried himself to sleep
for days.

07:29.517 --> 07:30.684
He wet the bed.

07:30.718 --> 07:32.185
- I'm sorry,
but this is the only way

07:32.219 --> 07:33.787
that we're gonna be able
to lock up West for good.

07:33.821 --> 07:36.189
- Well, you should've
gotten it right the first time.

07:39.226 --> 07:41.629
- I promise you, Ms. Price,

07:41.662 --> 07:43.263
this kind of thing
will not happen again.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.765
- It doesn't matter.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.067
I spoke with Sammy's father
a few minutes ago.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.803
I'm gonna send Sammy to North
Carolina to stay with him.

07:49.837 --> 07:50.871
- Well, that's fine.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.773
We can fly them both back here
for the new trial.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.575
- Come on, Sammy!
Take it to the hoop!

07:54.608 --> 07:56.810
Take it to the hoop!
You got it! Come on!

07:56.844 --> 07:59.713
- Sammy needs to get away
from here for good.

07:59.747 --> 08:01.949
They bully him in school now.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.216
Some people around here,

08:03.250 --> 08:04.885
they think we should've
never come forward.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.787
- My mind is made up.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.288
- I don't think
you've thought this through.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.724
- Okay, Kayla.

08:10.758 --> 08:13.561
You let us know
how he's doing, okay?

08:15.596 --> 08:17.531
Let's go.

08:18.766 --> 08:20.601
- Sammy's our best witness.

08:20.634 --> 08:21.935
He's the oldest
and most articulate

08:21.969 --> 08:23.604
about what West said
and did to him.

08:23.637 --> 08:24.905
- Look, she's just
looking out for her son.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.008
We can't strong-arm
these families

08:28.041 --> 08:29.276
into cooperating.

08:29.309 --> 08:32.279
I'll--I'll double back
in a few days.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.918
Um, look, can you--
can you take it from here?

08:37.951 --> 08:40.888
There's--there's something
I gotta deal with.

08:43.323 --> 08:45.058
- Easy, Sully.

08:45.092 --> 08:46.627
- Hey, Frankie,
what's going on?

08:46.660 --> 08:48.061
- He was three sheets
to the wind

08:48.095 --> 08:49.830
a couple of vodkas ago,
then Sully made a crack

08:49.863 --> 08:51.999
about Cassidy screwing up
in court today.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.767
Cassidy went full cage fighter
on him.

08:53.801 --> 08:55.636
- Okay,
thanks for the heads-up.

08:55.669 --> 08:56.804
- I'm going. I'm going.
- There you go, there you go.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.073
- Brought your girlfriend here
now to fight your battles?

09:00.107 --> 09:01.842
- Yeah, you know what, you're
lucky she showed up, ass-wipe.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.977
- Right here--
- Hey! Enough! Guys, enough!

09:04.011 --> 09:06.246
Brian! Calm down.

09:06.279 --> 09:07.815
- Get your hands off me!
- Just quiet, shh.

09:07.848 --> 09:09.983
- Get your hands off me.

09:10.017 --> 09:12.119
- What, did you come here to
read me the Riot Act, Liv, huh?

09:12.152 --> 09:13.654
Is that what you came to do?

09:13.687 --> 09:15.355
- No, I'm gonna leave
that job to Stone.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.090
- What was I supposed
to do in there, huh?

09:17.124 --> 09:19.727
Was I supposed to just--to sit
back, huh, and then take it?

09:19.760 --> 09:21.729
- You don't think, Brian.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.764
- I screwed up. I'm sorry.

09:23.797 --> 09:26.099
Next time--
- If there is a next time.

09:28.135 --> 09:30.871
West might walk,
that's what I'm talking about,

09:30.904 --> 09:33.874
because of your epic tantrum.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.308
- And I don't think
those families

09:35.342 --> 09:37.110
can handle another trial,
Brian.

09:37.144 --> 09:38.812
- Then you gotta go
talk to them, right?

09:38.846 --> 09:41.181
No, no, no. You gotta go
do your thing, right?

09:41.214 --> 09:43.283
'Cause you're the best.
Yeah.

09:43.316 --> 09:45.819
You're the Olivia Benson!
Oh, my God!

09:45.853 --> 09:47.254
- He's done.
- You know what, Joe,

09:47.287 --> 09:48.822
s--seriously,
get her a drink, man.

09:48.856 --> 09:50.624
- He's done. He's done, Joe.
- I'm not done.

09:50.658 --> 09:51.992
- Frankie, do me a favor.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.360
Get him home,
and get him in an Uber, okay?

09:53.393 --> 09:55.395
- I got him.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.164
You're just gonna kick me
while I'm down?

09:57.197 --> 09:58.899
Are you gonna leave, Liv...
- Brian--Brian, listen to me...

09:58.932 --> 10:00.067
- Just like you always do--
don't touch me.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.401
- Go home, Brian.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.070
- You wanna know something,
Olivia?

10:03.103 --> 10:05.038
I am home.

10:05.072 --> 10:07.641
Yeah. Joe! Joe!

10:11.879 --> 10:13.647
- Tommy's with the sitter.

10:13.681 --> 10:16.183
I wish I could stay home
with him, but I need this job.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.689
After walking into
a room full of strangers

10:21.722 --> 10:23.957
and facing the man who--

10:24.825 --> 10:27.027
And now you tell me he's gotta
do it all over again.

10:27.060 --> 10:29.162
- We're gonna put West away
for the rest of his life,

10:29.196 --> 10:30.664
I promise.

10:30.698 --> 10:32.900
- Yeah, well, you said that
the first time.

11:02.395 --> 11:05.699
- I need your help.

11:09.970 --> 11:10.137
.

11:10.170 --> 11:10.704
- Hi.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.406
Weren't you wearing
that same suit yesterday?

11:13.440 --> 11:15.308
- My, um--
my dry cleaner shut down.

11:15.342 --> 11:17.277
- Oh, that's too bad. I thought
you might be getting laid.

11:17.310 --> 11:18.912
- Don't think too much,
Rollins.

11:18.946 --> 11:20.180
- Housekeeper's inside.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.750
She found the vic, called 911.

11:22.783 --> 11:26.053
DOA when we got here.

11:27.320 --> 11:31.224
- Say hello again
to your friend, Dr. West.

11:31.258 --> 11:33.426
No forced entry,
multiple stab wounds.

11:33.460 --> 11:36.296
- Yeah, it looks like he was
stabbed about ten times.

11:36.329 --> 11:39.032
One thrust to the neck pierced
his external carotid artery.

11:39.066 --> 11:41.134
He bled out
in less than a minute.

11:41.168 --> 11:42.770
- Too bad the son of a bitch
didn't suffer.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.838
- I got my guys on it.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.139
- From this neck wound,

11:46.173 --> 11:48.175
I'm guessing a thin knife,
single-edged blade.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.911
- I'll swab for contaminate DNA

11:50.944 --> 11:52.746
in the event the perp
cut him or herself.

11:52.780 --> 11:54.181
That'll take time,
though, so...

11:54.214 --> 11:55.415
- All right, thanks, Fitz.
- Yeah.

11:55.448 --> 11:57.250
- All right, so,
I got the housekeeper.

11:57.284 --> 11:59.052
You wanna start knocking on
neighbors' doors?

11:59.086 --> 12:01.088
- Or you could let
Homicide handle it.

12:01.121 --> 12:02.455
Detective Devin Holiday.

12:02.489 --> 12:04.491
- Detective Carisi.
This is Detective Rollins.

12:04.524 --> 12:05.926
- I know who you are.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.928
- Then you know
West was our case.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.129
- Yeah, it's all over the news

12:09.162 --> 12:10.463
how that racist
from the DA squad

12:10.497 --> 12:12.165
self-destructed in court.
- Yeah.

12:12.199 --> 12:15.068
Uh, I--I know Cassidy.
He's no racist.

12:15.102 --> 12:16.937
- He just gets off on
roughing up black suspects?

12:16.970 --> 12:18.171
- Pedophiles.

12:18.205 --> 12:19.339
Tends to bring out
the worst in people.

12:19.372 --> 12:21.174
- Let's focus on this murder.

12:21.208 --> 12:23.143
Now, we investigated West
for the past two years.

12:23.176 --> 12:24.311
If we combine our resources--

12:24.344 --> 12:26.046
No, I--I've got it
from here,

12:26.079 --> 12:27.414
and I'd appreciate you
getting out of my crime scene

12:27.447 --> 12:29.482
before you people
screw that up too.

12:31.218 --> 12:33.821
- It's a little early in the
morning for stick up your ass.

12:36.123 --> 12:38.358
- Oh, that's Liv.
I'm gonna call, fill her in.

12:38.391 --> 12:40.527
I'll meet you back
at the squad room.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.262
*

12:42.295 --> 12:43.496
- Thank you so much
for taking him.

12:43.530 --> 12:46.099
- Hi, Mom.

12:46.133 --> 12:47.835
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:47.868 --> 12:50.070
Oh, and he likes
blueberry pancakes.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.238
- And school starts
at 8:00, right?

12:51.271 --> 12:52.405
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.507
So, how's the, uh,
West thing going?

12:54.541 --> 12:56.543
- Homicide kicked us
off the case.

12:59.046 --> 13:00.881
- Oh.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.415
Okay, so, Noah,

13:02.449 --> 13:05.385
Auntie Amanda is gonna
take you to school,

13:05.418 --> 13:08.121
and Lucy is gonna
pick you up, okay?

13:08.155 --> 13:09.589
- Mm-hmm.
- So have a great day.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.324
I love you.
- I love you too, Mom.

13:11.358 --> 13:12.960
- Here's your hat.
- Thanks.

13:12.993 --> 13:14.494
- Okay.

13:14.527 --> 13:17.030
All right.

13:17.064 --> 13:18.498
- Uh, yeah, yeah,
I'll be in later.

13:18.531 --> 13:20.333
- Okay.
- Okay, bye. Thank you.

13:20.367 --> 13:23.170
- Bye, Mom.

13:25.338 --> 13:28.075
- Can't believe you actually
held onto these sweats.

13:28.108 --> 13:29.977
- I wear them
to clean my toilet.

13:33.046 --> 13:35.548
- Thank you.

13:35.582 --> 13:38.085
Look, Liv, you know
if I had anywhere else to go--

13:38.118 --> 13:39.920
- I have a kid, Brian.
- I know.

13:39.953 --> 13:41.154
- It wasn't enough

13:41.188 --> 13:43.090
that you investigated me
for child abuse.

13:43.123 --> 13:45.292
I almost lost my son
because of you, and now?

13:45.325 --> 13:47.594
- Look, you have every right
to be pissed off, all right?

13:47.627 --> 13:49.062
I understand that.

13:49.096 --> 13:50.497
But, hey, there was a time

13:50.530 --> 13:52.132
when you actually
cared about me, Liv.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.401
- Oh, don't. Please don't.

13:54.434 --> 13:57.470
- All right, you know what,
screw that.

13:57.504 --> 14:01.341
If anyone can prove that
I didn't kill West, it's you.

14:01.374 --> 14:04.144
- Just because I agree
to hear you out

14:04.177 --> 14:07.080
does not mean that
I won't turn you in.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.986
- This morning, my dog,
Frannie, woke me up

14:13.020 --> 14:14.922
by licking me all over my face.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.189
That's gross, right?

14:18.425 --> 14:21.161
- Yeah. She's not supposed to,
but she does it anyway.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.596
- That's funny.
- Hm.

14:23.630 --> 14:26.599
Did anything funny happen
to you this morning, Noah?

14:26.633 --> 14:28.168
- I had to use
white toothpaste,

14:28.201 --> 14:30.403
'cause my mom's sink
was broken.

14:30.437 --> 14:32.472
- Huh.

14:32.505 --> 14:34.607
What are you drawing there?
Boots?

14:34.641 --> 14:37.210
- They were in the kitchen
this morning.

14:38.078 --> 14:40.213
--
are they your mom's?

14:40.247 --> 14:42.415
- No, they're too big.

14:44.017 --> 14:47.387
- Look, after you left the bar,
Joe stopped serving me,

14:47.420 --> 14:49.189
so I went and I finished
drinking at Kang's.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.091
- Brian, I told you to go home.

14:51.124 --> 14:52.960
We're way past that, Liv.

14:52.993 --> 14:55.362
Way past that.

14:55.395 --> 14:59.967
I just--I couldn't get
that smug look on West's face

15:00.000 --> 15:02.635
out of my mind
after the judge released him.

15:02.669 --> 15:05.372
- And now West is dead, and
you have blood on your clothes.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.307
- Yeah, but I didn't kill him.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.609
And you said you'd hear me out.

15:11.211 --> 15:13.313
- Go ahead.

15:13.346 --> 15:14.647
- When I went to West's house,

15:14.681 --> 15:17.450
I went there to tell him
that I was watching him,

15:17.484 --> 15:21.354
and that if he tried to
intimidate those three kids

15:21.388 --> 15:23.456
like he intimidated
the other victims--

15:24.992 --> 15:26.659
You'd what, Brian?

15:26.693 --> 15:30.530
That was an incredibly
stupid thing to do.

15:30.563 --> 15:32.299
- I get it, Liv!

15:34.567 --> 15:36.669
I'm sorry.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.405
Look, I went to West's house,

15:38.438 --> 15:40.373
and I got there, and
the front door was open, right,

15:40.407 --> 15:42.542
and it was dark,
but I went inside anyway.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.644
And I called out his name.
Nothing.

15:44.677 --> 15:47.714
And then, boom,
somebody hits me from behind,

15:47.747 --> 15:51.184
and the next thing I know,
I--I wake up on the floor,

15:51.218 --> 15:54.154
and I'm laying there
next to West's body,

15:54.187 --> 15:55.989
covered in his blood.

15:56.023 --> 15:57.390
*

15:57.424 --> 15:59.092
- That's a hell of a story,
Brian.

15:59.126 --> 16:01.094
- Look, if you wanna
take me in, fine,

16:01.128 --> 16:03.030
but I gotta know
deep in my heart

16:03.063 --> 16:04.364
that you know in your heart

16:04.397 --> 16:07.300
that I could never
do something like that.

16:07.334 --> 16:11.004
*

16:13.340 --> 16:16.343
Uh, you need to get out
in front of this, Brian.

16:16.376 --> 16:18.311
Oh, come on.

16:18.345 --> 16:21.314
You know what happens
if I come in.

16:21.348 --> 16:24.717
You know that--that if I say
that I went to West's house,

16:24.751 --> 16:27.187
after what I said in court,

16:27.220 --> 16:28.688
case closed.

16:28.721 --> 16:31.591
*

16:31.624 --> 16:33.293
- Okay...

16:33.326 --> 16:36.629
So let's go back
to the beginning.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.331
What is the first thing
you remember

16:38.365 --> 16:41.101
when you went inside
that house, Brian?

16:41.134 --> 16:43.270
Did you hear anything?

16:43.303 --> 16:45.605
Did you see any piece
of their clothing?

16:45.638 --> 16:48.575
Did you smell anything?
Did you smell his blood?

16:48.608 --> 16:50.110
- You're not gonna
trigger anything here.

16:50.143 --> 16:51.511
I was blitzed.

16:51.544 --> 16:52.812
- You want my help,
you're gonna do it my way.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.348
Otherwise, there's the door.

16:55.382 --> 16:57.417
- All right...

16:57.450 --> 17:00.487
there's one thing.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.422
When I was taking off my jeans,

17:02.455 --> 17:05.292
I found this in the tread
of one of my boots.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.160
Careful, it's got blood on it.

17:07.194 --> 17:08.761
- I don't know.

17:10.463 --> 17:12.765
What do we do?

17:12.799 --> 17:15.368
*

17:15.402 --> 17:18.205
- Hey, who's handling
the West case at Homicide?

17:18.238 --> 17:19.639
- Uh, Detective Devin Holiday.

17:19.672 --> 17:21.774
She made it clear that
she did not want our help.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.443
- Yeah, and if
I'm not mistaken,

17:23.476 --> 17:24.777
she flashed a quick peek
at the race card.

17:24.811 --> 17:26.546
You know, her father's

17:26.579 --> 17:28.781
the Deputy Commissioner
of Corrections.

17:28.815 --> 17:31.084
- Explains the gold shield.
- Yeah, and the attitude.

17:31.118 --> 17:32.785
- Did you at least get
crime scene photos

17:32.819 --> 17:36.323
before she chased you away?
- Yeah, this is everything.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.703
- Yeah.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.273
- Not yet.

17:53.306 --> 17:55.142
Listen, do you remember
anything unusual

17:55.175 --> 17:56.176
from the crime scene?

17:56.209 --> 17:58.478
Maybe bloody fingerprints?

17:58.511 --> 18:00.747
- Not that I noticed, no.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.717
You get your sink fixed?

18:04.751 --> 18:06.586
Oh, not yet.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.588
- Liv...

18:08.621 --> 18:11.258
Liv, what's going on?

18:11.291 --> 18:14.694
- The pair of men's boots
at your apartment this morning.

18:15.795 --> 18:18.865
- You're really gonna make me
work this hard for it?

18:33.213 --> 18:34.914
- They're Cassidy's.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.751
- It's not what you think.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.787
*

18:43.556 --> 18:47.594
Cassidy was at
West's brownstone last night.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.597
He went there to admonish him.

18:50.630 --> 18:53.400
- Never got the chance.

18:53.433 --> 18:56.569
Walked in, he was hit
over the head from behind,

18:56.603 --> 18:59.372
and when he woke up,
he found West's body.

18:59.406 --> 19:01.208
*

19:02.375 --> 19:04.477
- He's in pretty bad shape,
Amanda.

19:07.247 --> 19:09.316
He needs to come in, Liv.
- Yes...

19:09.349 --> 19:11.184
And he will.
Just not yet.

19:11.218 --> 19:12.919
- Because you and Cassidy
used to be together?

19:12.952 --> 19:15.288
- If I thought that he had
anything to do with this,

19:15.322 --> 19:16.923
that wouldn't matter,
and you know that.

19:16.956 --> 19:19.792
- Come on, Liv.
He exploded in the courtroom.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.928
I mean, what's he--
what's he capable of one-on-one

19:21.961 --> 19:24.864
after a few tequila shots?

19:24.897 --> 19:26.633
I mean, he could
just be playing you.

19:26.666 --> 19:29.536
- Amanda, can you just give me
a little bit of credit?

19:29.569 --> 19:32.639
- I know Cassidy, and I know
his fuse is so short,

19:32.672 --> 19:36.209
and he is notorious for
making really bad decisions.

19:36.243 --> 19:38.411
*

19:40.813 --> 19:43.316
*

19:45.285 --> 19:47.287
So, what

19:47.320 --> 19:50.523
*

19:50.557 --> 19:52.392
- For now...

19:52.425 --> 19:54.394
*

19:54.427 --> 19:55.995
For now, we work the case.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.664
*

19:57.697 --> 19:59.232
- And if Stone finds out

19:59.266 --> 20:00.933
that Cassidy's hiding out
in your apartment,

20:00.967 --> 20:03.536
it's not just your ass
on the line now.

20:03.570 --> 20:06.005
*

20:06.038 --> 20:07.807
It's mine too.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.442
*

20:17.950 --> 20:18.285
.

20:18.318 --> 20:19.419
- So, I'd like to do some
follow-up on the West murder.

20:20.953 --> 20:22.389
- Detective Holiday
reach out to you?

20:22.422 --> 20:23.656
- No.

20:23.690 --> 20:25.258
- Then why are
we pursuing this, Liv?

20:25.292 --> 20:26.926
- You know what, let--
let me deal with Holiday.

20:26.959 --> 20:29.462
- Nope, this is coming from me.

20:30.863 --> 20:32.599
- Look, the families
of these kids

20:32.632 --> 20:34.801
have been through
a two-year ordeal.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.936
If we can rule them out,
with minimal intrusion,

20:36.969 --> 20:38.938
I think it would help them
start their healing.

20:38.971 --> 20:40.440
- Well, I'm surprised Cassidy
hasn't reached out to you

20:40.473 --> 20:42.842
to see if we got a suspect yet.
- Me too.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.311
- Yeah, let's just
focus on the case,

20:44.344 --> 20:46.446
and I will check in
with Cassidy.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.821
- I'm glad that bastard's dead.

20:54.854 --> 20:56.289
We were fooling ourselves

20:56.323 --> 20:57.890
to think we'd get justice
any other way.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.559
- I just tightened the leads
on the light socket,

20:59.592 --> 21:00.560
changed the bulb.

21:00.593 --> 21:01.728
You're good to go.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.331
- Thanks, G.

21:04.364 --> 21:06.899
- That's Glanville.
He lives down the hall.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.601
- Well, listen,
we have to ask you:

21:08.635 --> 21:11.904
Where were you and Reggie
Tuesday night around 11:00?

21:11.938 --> 21:14.941
- Yes, Reggie.

21:14.974 --> 21:16.509
We all watched "X-Men."

21:16.543 --> 21:18.845
Sammy fell asleep on the couch
around 10:00,

21:18.878 --> 21:20.547
Reggie carried him
to their bedroom,

21:20.580 --> 21:21.714
and we all went to sleep.

21:23.115 --> 21:26.319
So, uh, Darren and PJ
are going ice skating.

21:26.353 --> 21:27.854
- Hold on.

21:29.522 --> 21:31.591
You ready, bro?

21:34.627 --> 21:36.963
*

21:36.996 --> 21:38.965
- Thanks, Ma!
- Mm-hmm.

21:38.998 --> 21:40.400
- Thank you, Mom.
- Have fun, baby.

21:40.433 --> 21:42.001
- Let's go, Reg.
- Get out of here.

21:42.034 --> 21:43.970
- Ms. Price, I couldn't help
but notice that envelope.

21:44.003 --> 21:46.038
- Oh, yeah, somebody
slipped that under the door

21:46.072 --> 21:48.074
around dinner time
Tuesday night.

21:48.107 --> 21:50.543
There was $5,000 in there,
and a note.

21:50.577 --> 21:53.613
Do you--do you mind
if I take a look at that note?

21:53.646 --> 21:58.017
*

21:58.050 --> 22:01.621
"More if you don't
go back to court."

22:01.654 --> 22:03.423
- Why didn't you tell us
about this?

22:03.456 --> 22:05.358
- I was trying to figure out
what to do.

22:05.392 --> 22:08.060
That's rent, groceries,
Sammy's therapy.

22:08.094 --> 22:10.797
And now that that son
of a bitch West is dead,

22:10.830 --> 22:12.532
I'm going to keep it.

22:12.565 --> 22:13.900
*

22:16.002 --> 22:17.870
- When you lost it in court,

22:17.904 --> 22:20.407
you kinda made yourself
suspect number one.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.675
I got a temper.

22:22.709 --> 22:24.110
- If Hector was your kid,

22:24.143 --> 22:25.745
what, you would've just
sat there like a statue

22:25.778 --> 22:27.880
when they let
that pervert walk?

22:27.914 --> 22:29.782
- Look around.

22:29.816 --> 22:32.018
Sharp objects everywhere.
- Okay.

22:32.051 --> 22:34.387
So, where were you on Tuesday
night around 11:00 p.m.?

22:34.421 --> 22:35.855
- I went for a walk
to let off some steam.

22:35.888 --> 22:37.524
- Around.

22:37.557 --> 22:38.958
- All right, you're gonna
have to do better than that.

22:38.991 --> 22:40.660
- You mind telling me
what you're doing here,

22:40.693 --> 22:41.961
Detective Rollins?

22:44.564 --> 22:47.500
- SVU spent two years with
these families building a case.

22:47.534 --> 22:48.501
Just because it's over

22:48.535 --> 22:50.069
doesn't mean we fall off
the face of the earth.

22:50.102 --> 22:51.538
- Does your lieutenant
know you're here?

22:51.571 --> 22:52.905
- I'm not trying to
step on your toes.

22:52.939 --> 22:53.940
- I already told you once
to back off.

22:53.973 --> 22:55.508
- Take it easy!

22:55.542 --> 22:56.943
- You know what happens
if one of these witnesses

22:56.976 --> 22:58.511
gets on the stand
and the defense finds out

22:58.545 --> 23:00.179
he told two different stories
to two different cops?

23:00.212 --> 23:02.081
- I know you're trying
to prove something.

23:02.114 --> 23:03.450
It would be helpful if you were

23:03.483 --> 23:04.817
a little less of
a bitch about it.

23:04.851 --> 23:08.187
Okay, thanks for the advice.

23:08.220 --> 23:08.955
By the way...

23:08.988 --> 23:10.723
I gotta talk to
Detective Cassidy.

23:10.757 --> 23:12.959
Any idea where he is?

23:12.992 --> 23:15.194
- I haven't seen him.

23:15.227 --> 23:16.929
- Mm.

23:19.165 --> 23:21.734
- Kayla says she spent
all night home with her kids.

23:21.768 --> 23:22.902
- And she took
West's hush money.

23:22.935 --> 23:24.136
He was gonna give her more.

23:24.170 --> 23:25.672
It doesn't make sense
that she'd kill him.

23:25.705 --> 23:26.873
- Felix Ramos says
he was out for a walk

23:26.906 --> 23:28.541
the night of the murder.

23:28.575 --> 23:31.043
I mean, he's got two assault
collars on his sheet, so...

23:31.077 --> 23:33.713
- Let's bring him in.
- Yeah.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.782
- Detective Holiday tells me
you're working West's murder?

23:35.815 --> 23:39.051
- Uh, may I have a word with
you in my office, Counselor?

23:40.587 --> 23:42.922
- I need to go out
for a minute.

23:42.955 --> 23:44.524
- I'm sorry.

23:44.557 --> 23:47.560
Please don't blame my people.
I should have told you.

23:47.594 --> 23:49.496
- You can't be running
a parallel investigation.

23:49.529 --> 23:50.463
- I agree with you,

23:50.497 --> 23:53.466
and with all due respect
to Detective Holiday,

23:53.500 --> 23:56.135
I believe that
I am better equipped

23:56.168 --> 23:58.605
to run this case.
- Homicide caught the case.

23:58.638 --> 24:01.574
If she needs your help,
she will ask for it.

24:01.608 --> 24:04.744
- I have a son, uh, Noah.
He's adopted,

24:04.777 --> 24:06.679
and not too long ago,

24:06.713 --> 24:09.982
he was kidnapped by
his biological grandmother.

24:10.016 --> 24:12.184
She didn't hurt him, but...

24:13.820 --> 24:16.489
I can't sleep at night.

24:16.523 --> 24:18.758
I stare at him at night
while he's sleeping,

24:18.791 --> 24:22.228
wondering if he's
gonna be okay.

24:22.261 --> 24:25.832
The damage that West did
to these boys--

24:25.865 --> 24:28.668
- Doesn't justify murder.

24:28.701 --> 24:30.703
- My point is--

24:30.737 --> 24:34.006
is that this case,
no matter how it plays out,

24:34.040 --> 24:37.744
has to be dealt with
sensitively.

24:37.777 --> 24:40.680
And since we're the ones
who botched your trial...

24:40.713 --> 24:42.048
- Cassidy, not you.

24:42.081 --> 24:43.783
He took a few days off.

24:43.816 --> 24:45.918
Have you talked to him?

24:45.952 --> 24:47.554
- Yes...

24:47.587 --> 24:48.821
*

24:48.855 --> 24:50.857
And he's very upset.

24:50.890 --> 24:52.659
We all are.

24:52.692 --> 24:54.093
*

24:54.126 --> 24:56.596
Look, your trial prep,

24:56.629 --> 24:58.798
would you mind
if we went through it?

25:00.232 --> 25:03.736
- Because West had
other patients,

25:03.770 --> 25:05.004
other victims whose families

25:05.037 --> 25:08.541
must have been affected
by the mistrial.

25:08.575 --> 25:11.310
- Whatever you uncover,
Holiday is your first call.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.813
- Absolutely.
- I'll send the file over.

25:13.846 --> 25:15.548
*

25:15.582 --> 25:18.050
And no more surprises,
Lieutenant.

25:18.084 --> 25:25.257
*

25:25.858 --> 25:27.960
What are you doing here?

25:27.994 --> 25:29.796
- I never took you
for a coward.

25:29.829 --> 25:31.764
- I didn't kill West.

25:31.798 --> 25:34.166
You went over there
looking for a fight?

25:35.334 --> 25:37.336
Yeah, why else would
you be hiding out here?

25:37.369 --> 25:39.305
- I didn't have a choice!

25:39.338 --> 25:40.973
Oh, so now you're
just gonna sit back

25:41.007 --> 25:42.875
and watch Liv destroy
her own career?

25:44.110 --> 25:45.111
- Stone is at the squad room
right now,

25:45.144 --> 25:46.746
ripping her a new one,

25:46.779 --> 25:48.981
because he found out that
we're back working West's case.

25:49.015 --> 25:50.583
So when Stone finds out

25:50.617 --> 25:53.285
that you were at
West's brownstone...

25:55.955 --> 25:57.757
- She'll think of something.

25:57.790 --> 26:00.159
- Oh, Cassidy,
she shouldn't have to!

26:00.192 --> 26:02.862
You--you really want charges
brought against her?

26:02.895 --> 26:04.330
- That's not gonna happen.

26:04.363 --> 26:05.898
Because your ass
is covered, right, Brian?

26:05.932 --> 26:07.199
And the hell with
everybody else? I got ya.

26:07.233 --> 26:09.101
- Oh, that's really rich!

26:09.135 --> 26:12.204
Really rich coming from you,
Rollins.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.774
You got some skeletons
in your closet, right?

26:14.807 --> 26:17.143
Who bailed you out?

26:17.176 --> 26:19.646
- That was different.

26:19.679 --> 26:22.148
God only knows

26:22.181 --> 26:25.117
why she trusts you.

26:25.151 --> 26:28.020
- Hey, you think
I killed West, hmm?

26:28.054 --> 26:31.290
Go ahead.
Arrest me.

26:31.323 --> 26:34.093
- You know I would
never go against Liv.

26:34.126 --> 26:37.730
*

26:37.764 --> 26:40.199
And if you ever gave
a damn about her,

26:40.232 --> 26:43.069
I'd man up
and turn yourself in.

26:43.102 --> 26:45.304
*

26:49.175 --> 26:53.045
*

26:53.079 --> 26:55.081
- Detective Holiday.

26:55.114 --> 26:56.883
I spoke with Olivia Benson.

26:56.916 --> 26:59.919
You'll be happy to know that--
- Oh, that's not why I'm here.

26:59.952 --> 27:01.988
We pulled this video...

27:02.021 --> 27:04.056
from a parking lot down the
street from West's brownstone.

27:04.090 --> 27:06.192
- Have a seat.
- I'm good.

27:06.225 --> 27:09.328
It was shot
the night of his murder.

27:09.361 --> 27:12.298
- He's tossing
the murder weapon.

27:12.331 --> 27:15.101
- I got guys opening up
the sewer right now.

27:15.134 --> 27:16.335
Keep watching.

27:19.739 --> 27:26.779
*

27:34.954 --> 27:35.121
.

27:35.154 --> 27:35.955
- Holiday's people said
they found a hat

27:37.389 --> 27:40.326
encrusted with blood
in the sewer.

27:40.359 --> 27:42.795
- Well, I'm sure
that Cassidy has...

27:42.829 --> 27:44.263
a good reason for being there.

27:44.296 --> 27:46.365
- Besides killing the man
he threatened in open court?

27:46.398 --> 27:48.835
- Let's not jump
to conclusions.

27:48.868 --> 27:49.869
- Do you have any idea
how bad this looks

27:49.902 --> 27:51.203
for me and my office?

27:51.237 --> 27:53.372
- I understand that
the optics are not good,

27:53.405 --> 27:54.941
but there is a possibility--

27:54.974 --> 27:58.010
- Holiday told me that you two
used to be a couple.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.714
- What does that have to do
with anything?

28:01.748 --> 28:02.982
- She went to arrest him
tonight.

28:03.015 --> 28:04.717
He hasn't been home
in two days.

28:04.751 --> 28:06.753
Do you know where he is?

28:06.786 --> 28:08.420
- He's right here.

28:11.023 --> 28:14.126
You don't need to test those.
Those are my clothes.

28:14.160 --> 28:15.962
West's blood.

28:15.995 --> 28:17.429
- I'll take him to
Interrogation One--

28:17.463 --> 28:19.131
- No.

28:19.165 --> 28:20.499
Fin...

28:20.532 --> 28:22.334
Interrogation One.

28:22.368 --> 28:26.773
*

28:26.806 --> 28:28.808
Call Detective Holiday.

28:28.841 --> 28:33.780
*

28:33.813 --> 28:36.082
- So, where have you been
for the last couple of days?

28:36.115 --> 28:37.416
- Just trying to
figure things out.

28:37.449 --> 28:39.151
- You're not answering
my question.

28:39.185 --> 28:41.520
- Look, let's stop
playing games here, okay?

28:41.553 --> 28:43.823
Do you wanna know
what went down at West's house,

28:43.856 --> 28:47.226
or do you wanna keep on dicking
around with trivialities?

28:50.797 --> 28:52.464
- You didn't have to
call Holiday.

28:52.498 --> 28:54.233
I could've handled this myself.

28:54.266 --> 28:56.168
- You think for a minute
I'm going to let you

28:56.202 --> 28:59.071
interrogate your ex
- Okay, Peter, listen to me...

29:00.807 --> 29:03.475
Cassidy has been staying
at my apartment.

29:03.509 --> 29:05.311
I know how this looks--

29:05.344 --> 29:07.479
- Right now, it looks like
you were obstructing justice.

29:07.513 --> 29:09.548
- I was trying to get justice.

29:09.581 --> 29:10.950
- By running
a rogue investigation?

29:12.885 --> 29:14.787
Prosecute everyone here?

29:14.821 --> 29:17.356
- If they keep killing people.

29:18.290 --> 29:20.960
- I went to West's place,
to check up on him

29:20.993 --> 29:22.494
and make sure he would behave

29:22.528 --> 29:24.797
until his court case
came up again.

29:24.831 --> 29:26.065
- You really expect me
to believe that

29:26.098 --> 29:27.533
after you told
an entire courtroom

29:27.566 --> 29:29.201
you'd be happy to see him
in a body bag?

29:30.502 --> 29:31.938
Do you really think
that I would kill this guy

29:31.971 --> 29:34.473
after I threatened him
in open court,

29:34.506 --> 29:36.976
in front of, what,
a dozen reporters?

29:37.009 --> 29:38.210
Come on.

29:38.244 --> 29:40.212
- Maybe you went there to talk
and things got out of hand.

29:40.246 --> 29:41.814
And then
what happened, Detective?

29:41.848 --> 29:43.082
And then,
instead of using my gun,

29:43.115 --> 29:45.051
what, I decided
to butcher the guy?

29:45.084 --> 29:47.219
You know we can
trace your service weapon.

29:47.253 --> 29:48.487
The plain facts are that

29:48.520 --> 29:49.822
after explicitly threatening
the victim,

29:49.856 --> 29:51.090
you were at the murder scene.

29:51.123 --> 29:52.825
You tried to get rid of
your bloody hat.

29:52.859 --> 29:54.160
- Yeah, well,
I don't remember that.

29:54.193 --> 29:55.962
- Maybe you don't remember
that you killed him.

29:55.995 --> 29:57.363
- You see, now you're twisting
things to fit your theory.

29:58.530 --> 29:59.999
- Well, for starters,
Detective,

30:00.032 --> 30:01.233
we're both on the job here.
- Exactly, dude.

30:01.267 --> 30:03.369
And then,
when you screwed the job up,

30:03.402 --> 30:04.937
you did the next best thing.

30:04.971 --> 30:06.372
- I don't roll like that.

30:06.405 --> 30:09.475
- Mm. Your reputation
around here says otherwise.

30:09.508 --> 30:10.977
You smacked West around once.

30:11.010 --> 30:12.278
What's to stop you
from murdering him

30:12.311 --> 30:13.980
if you thought you could
get away with it?

30:14.013 --> 30:15.514
Especially with
your ex-girlfriend around

30:15.547 --> 30:17.116
to screw up the investigation.
- Hey, listen to me!

30:17.149 --> 30:19.118
She had nothing
to do with that!

30:19.151 --> 30:21.487
You got that?
Nothing!

30:23.155 --> 30:25.091
I see another overzealous cop
trying to get over

30:25.124 --> 30:27.193
after he kills
an unarmed black man.

30:27.226 --> 30:28.394
- You know what,

30:28.427 --> 30:30.997
I think I'd like
my PBA rep now.

30:31.030 --> 30:31.998
- Oh.

30:32.031 --> 30:33.165
- And a lawyer
while you're at it.

30:33.199 --> 30:34.233
- What a surprise.

30:34.266 --> 30:36.202
You're gonna hide behind
a couple of white suits now.

30:36.235 --> 30:39.538
- Let's get one thing really
straight here, Detective...

30:39.571 --> 30:41.173
You're the one that made this
a race thing.

30:41.207 --> 30:44.143
- Hey.
He asked for his lawyer.

30:44.176 --> 30:46.445
- Defending your ex,
that's touching.

30:46.478 --> 30:48.347
- I wouldn't need to
if I thought he was getting

30:48.380 --> 30:49.982
a fair shake in here.

30:50.016 --> 30:51.550
- You have something that
points to another suspect?

30:53.319 --> 30:55.287
I didn't think so.

30:55.321 --> 30:59.025
- So, you do what you need
to do, Detective,

30:59.058 --> 31:01.593
but the next time
you have a problem with me,

31:01.627 --> 31:05.164
at least have the balls to talk
to me face

31:05.197 --> 31:06.465
Cop to cop.

31:06.498 --> 31:08.134
- I'm just doing my job.

31:08.167 --> 31:10.569
Trying to fight my way up
like you did, Lieutenant.

31:10.602 --> 31:14.040
*

31:14.073 --> 31:16.542
- Place Detective Cassidy
under arrest for murder.

31:18.344 --> 31:25.351
*

31:26.986 --> 31:29.155
- Stone, don't come down
so hard on Liv.

31:29.188 --> 31:30.556
- You a part of this too,
Detective?

31:30.589 --> 31:31.924
- If she had asked me to,
I would've been.

31:31.958 --> 31:33.325
- That's refreshing.

31:33.359 --> 31:34.927
- You stick around long enough,
you'll see.

31:34.961 --> 31:36.128
That you're all criminals?

31:36.162 --> 31:38.630
- Yo, Stone--Stone, listen...

31:38.664 --> 31:41.533
When I first got to SVU,
I was a hot head, okay?

31:41.567 --> 31:43.135
More times than
I'd like to admit,

31:43.169 --> 31:45.404
I wanted to put a bullet
in one of those sickos' heads.

31:45.437 --> 31:47.539
Liv saw I was spiraling,
and she sent my home,

31:47.573 --> 31:49.175
so I could get
my head together.

31:49.208 --> 31:50.977
If she thought
Cassidy was guilty,

31:51.010 --> 31:52.311
she would've brought him in.

31:52.344 --> 31:53.612
- So I'm just supposed
to ignore the fact

31:53.645 --> 31:55.081
that she lied to me?

31:55.114 --> 31:56.515
- I've been around the block
a couple of times.

31:56.548 --> 31:57.950
Trust me on this.

31:57.984 --> 32:00.586
*

32:00.619 --> 32:01.954
- Perp walk into
Central Booking.

32:01.988 --> 32:03.555
Wanna join me?

32:03.589 --> 32:04.957
- Hell no.

32:04.991 --> 32:08.627
*

32:08.660 --> 32:10.596
It doesn't look good, Liv.

32:10.629 --> 32:13.365
- I know, Fin.
- For you.

32:13.399 --> 32:15.434
I mean, you knew he was there
and you covered up for him?

32:15.467 --> 32:18.204
- I was giving him
the benefit of the doubt.

32:18.237 --> 32:19.605
- You still think
he didn't do it?

32:21.707 --> 32:24.376
I don't know
what to think anymore.

32:27.146 --> 32:29.115
Tests for contaminants
came back.

32:29.148 --> 32:31.117
Pretty much all the DNA
was West's, obviously,

32:31.150 --> 32:33.619
but there were trace amounts
from another source.

32:33.652 --> 32:35.487
- Nope.

32:37.256 --> 32:38.724
- Not unless you have
a database for SeaWorld.

32:38.757 --> 32:40.526
- It's from a fish.

32:40.559 --> 32:42.561
- Okay, that's--
that's not helpful.

32:42.594 --> 32:44.030
Maybe the murder weapon
was, uh,

32:44.063 --> 32:45.564
one of West's kitchen knives.
- Mm.

32:45.597 --> 32:47.666
- That could explain fish DNA.

32:47.699 --> 32:49.401
At least it wasn't bad news.

32:49.435 --> 32:53.972
- Hold on. I remember something
from Stone's prep files.

32:56.375 --> 32:58.444
Sammy Price went
to see Dr. West once,

32:58.477 --> 33:01.680
because he got
his armed sliced open...

33:01.713 --> 33:03.282
on fishhooks.

33:03.315 --> 33:05.617
He got four stitches.
- Not following.

33:05.651 --> 33:07.219
- Well, where there are
fishing hooks,

33:07.253 --> 33:08.687
there could be a fishing knife.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.023
- Yeah, but Kayla doesn't
strike me as a fisherman.

33:11.057 --> 33:12.791
- Did--does Kayla have
a man in her life?

33:12.824 --> 33:14.293
- When we were
at her apartment,

33:14.326 --> 33:16.328
there were two wine glasses
in the sink.

33:24.203 --> 33:26.272
Because I already gave
some of it to my landlord.

33:26.305 --> 33:27.739
- No, no, it's--it's not that.

33:27.773 --> 33:29.408
Now, the last time
I was at your house,

33:29.441 --> 33:31.610
I noticed that you were
washing two wine glasses.

33:31.643 --> 33:35.314
- My friend, Glanville,
stopped by the night before.

33:36.782 --> 33:38.650
- Yeah, I see him
from time to time.

33:38.684 --> 33:40.686
- Glanville ever
take Sammy fishing?

33:40.719 --> 33:42.721
- They go to the East River
all the time for stripers.

33:42.754 --> 33:44.556
Why?

33:49.128 --> 33:50.696
*

33:50.729 --> 33:53.299
- Of course, man.

33:53.332 --> 33:55.801
- Well, it must've hopped
out of there somehow.

33:55.834 --> 34:02.174
*

34:12.518 --> 34:12.651
.

34:12.684 --> 34:13.652
- Glanville wouldn't do
something like this, never.

34:16.888 --> 34:18.424
Kayla, I know what it is

34:18.457 --> 34:20.226
to wanna protect somebody
that you care about.

34:20.259 --> 34:22.494
- You're wrong.

34:22.528 --> 34:24.463
- Was Glanville angry
about the mistrial?

34:24.496 --> 34:26.565
- I don't know.
I'm sure he was, but--

34:26.598 --> 34:28.734
- He didn't even know about it
until the next day.

34:28.767 --> 34:31.203
- That's when he came over
with the bottle of wine,

34:31.237 --> 34:32.771
right, Mom?

34:39.411 --> 34:42.881
- Reggie, can I see
that fidget spinner?

34:42.914 --> 34:44.150
- Sure.

34:52.191 --> 34:54.660
*

34:58.930 --> 35:05.771
*

35:05.804 --> 35:08.540
- I hear you're a Mets fan.

35:08.574 --> 35:10.276
- Oh, you're here
to talk about baseball?

35:11.610 --> 35:13.712
We've got some time to kill.

35:13.745 --> 35:16.648
You know I used to
play for the Cubs?

35:16.682 --> 35:18.684
Just for a cup of coffee.

35:18.717 --> 35:21.320
I blew out my UCL.
I had to quit.

35:21.353 --> 35:22.854
That was a bad time for me.

35:22.888 --> 35:25.791
My whole identity was wrapped
up in being a ballplayer,

35:25.824 --> 35:27.526
and when I felt
that ligament rip,

35:27.559 --> 35:29.461
it was like someone robbed me
of who I was...

35:29.495 --> 35:31.830
everything I could be,

35:31.863 --> 35:34.900
kinda like what Dr. West
did to Sammy.

35:34.933 --> 35:36.802
*

35:36.835 --> 35:39.538
I didn't have
anyone to blame...

35:39.571 --> 35:43.175
nowhere to put my anger,
and it tore me up inside.

35:43.209 --> 35:46.812
*

35:46.845 --> 35:49.415
- Yeah.

35:49.448 --> 35:52.218
Plus, I let my family down.

35:52.251 --> 35:55.221
*

35:55.254 --> 35:58.290
- What happened to Sammy...

35:58.324 --> 35:59.858
That's on me.

35:59.891 --> 36:02.428
- You couldn't have known.
- Yeah.

36:02.461 --> 36:04.296
Yeah--yeah, I did.

36:04.330 --> 36:06.698
*

36:06.732 --> 36:09.301
And I didn't do anything
to protect him.

36:09.335 --> 36:11.337
*

36:11.370 --> 36:13.372
- Sammy told you
what West was doing?

36:13.405 --> 36:14.906
- No.

36:14.940 --> 36:16.675
*

36:16.708 --> 36:19.345
I went to Dr. West, too.

36:19.378 --> 36:26.285
*

36:29.288 --> 36:32.658
I was...11.

36:32.691 --> 36:34.960
My dad had just left us.

36:34.993 --> 36:37.429
And my mom...

36:37.463 --> 36:39.998
my mom cried all the time.

36:40.031 --> 36:41.600
*

36:41.633 --> 36:43.969
And I couldn't...

36:44.002 --> 36:46.338
tell her...

36:46.372 --> 36:48.274
what was going on...

36:48.307 --> 36:50.876
*

36:50.909 --> 36:54.880
Or anybody else.

36:54.913 --> 36:57.649
I didn't want them
to think that I liked it or...

36:57.683 --> 36:59.551
*

36:59.585 --> 37:02.688
My friends find out,
and--and...

37:02.721 --> 37:04.656
think that I was gay.

37:04.690 --> 37:06.858
*

37:08.627 --> 37:10.629
*

37:10.662 --> 37:13.499
- A year or so.

37:15.066 --> 37:17.503
- If my mom and Sammy
found out that I knew,

37:17.536 --> 37:19.505
they'd hate me forever.

37:19.538 --> 37:23.942
*

37:23.975 --> 37:26.578
He tried to buy us off.

37:26.612 --> 37:30.549
And my mom
was gonna send Sammy away.

37:30.582 --> 37:32.017
*

37:32.050 --> 37:33.752
I--

37:33.785 --> 37:36.655
I had to do something.

37:36.688 --> 37:39.658
I--I--I couldn't let him
get away with it...

37:39.691 --> 37:44.396
*

37:44.430 --> 37:46.298
Not again.

37:46.332 --> 37:52.771
*

37:56.107 --> 37:59.578
What kind of mother
lets this happen to her babies?

38:01.713 --> 38:04.316
- I'm so sorry, Kayla.

38:04.350 --> 38:11.390
*

38:17.963 --> 38:20.699
- Hey, no, I'm good, Johnny.
Thanks.

38:20.732 --> 38:21.933
- What, are you here
to fall on your sword?

38:21.967 --> 38:23.101
- I heard that
Reggie confessed.

38:23.134 --> 38:25.571
- Yeah, he did.

38:25.604 --> 38:26.872
- I mean, can you cut
this kid a deal?

38:26.905 --> 38:28.540
Don't you think
he's suffered enough?

38:28.574 --> 38:29.875
- So, you total my case,

38:29.908 --> 38:31.510
you, uh, run from
a murder scene,

38:31.543 --> 38:32.878
and hole up with
a fellow officer,

38:32.911 --> 38:34.112
and now you're telling me
how to do my job?

38:34.145 --> 38:35.547
- Okay, so then fire me then,
all right?

38:35.581 --> 38:36.948
I deserve that.
I get that.

38:36.982 --> 38:38.650
But not Reggie.
Come on, man.

38:38.684 --> 38:40.652
After what West did to him?

38:40.686 --> 38:42.521
This kid's gonna be
chasing demons away

38:42.554 --> 38:45.123
the rest of his life.

38:45.156 --> 38:46.825
Every relationship,

38:46.858 --> 38:50.829
every time this kid
looks into a mirror,

38:50.862 --> 38:54.666
there's just--there's gonna be
this looming shadow there.

39:00.472 --> 39:02.674
- Olivia didn't tell me.

39:02.708 --> 39:04.876
- Olivia doesn't know.

39:06.077 --> 39:09.615
- That's why I left.

39:09.648 --> 39:12.651
All those years ago, I just--

39:12.684 --> 39:15.020
I just couldn't handle SVU.

39:15.053 --> 39:20.626
*

39:20.659 --> 39:22.928
It was my Little League coach.

39:22.961 --> 39:26.598
Yeah, truth is, though, it only
went on for a couple of months.

39:26.632 --> 39:28.534
And then, my father found out.

39:28.567 --> 39:30.802
He beat the crap
out of the guy.

39:30.836 --> 39:33.171
*

39:33.204 --> 39:35.741
Look...

39:35.774 --> 39:38.043
How about Reggie?

39:41.680 --> 39:43.849
- I'll see what I can do.

39:45.684 --> 39:47.419
- Fair enough.
Thank you.

39:47.453 --> 39:48.820
Yeah.

39:48.854 --> 39:56.061
*

40:02.501 --> 40:05.537
- Hey, Liv.
- Brian...

40:05.571 --> 40:07.939
- I was just inside,
begging Stone not to fire me.

40:07.973 --> 40:11.076
- I don't know. We'll see.

40:11.109 --> 40:14.746
Hey, Liv, I'm real sorry
about what happened, really.

40:14.780 --> 40:17.683
- You would've done
the same thing for me.

40:17.716 --> 40:18.750
- Yeah.
- Take care.

40:18.784 --> 40:20.118
- Yeah.

40:20.151 --> 40:21.987
Hey, about Noah...

40:22.020 --> 40:25.090
Just hear me out, please.

40:25.123 --> 40:26.892
Look...

40:26.925 --> 40:29.595
I--I, uh--I wasn't airing
your dirty laundry to the DA.

40:29.628 --> 40:32.564
I was actually--
I was airing mine.

40:32.598 --> 40:34.600
- Uh, I--

40:34.633 --> 40:36.902
I just--I--I was--I was trying
to explain to Morrison

40:36.935 --> 40:39.571
what had happened
between you and I.

40:39.605 --> 40:41.607
I--I had no idea

40:41.640 --> 40:43.141
that you were
under investigation.

40:43.174 --> 40:46.578
I would never, ever,
ever do anything

40:46.612 --> 40:49.781
to intentionally hurt
Noah or you.

40:49.815 --> 40:53.218
I mean, come on now.
You're the love of my life.

40:57.856 --> 41:00.592
*

41:00.626 --> 41:01.860
- Sorry, Brian, I don't--

41:01.893 --> 41:03.261
I don't know
where that's coming from.

41:03.294 --> 41:06.965
We broke up a--a long time ago.
- I know that.

41:06.998 --> 41:09.535
You and I, we had a lot
of good times together,

41:09.568 --> 41:12.704
a lot of mutual love
and respect for one another,

41:12.738 --> 41:14.239
but please,

41:14.272 --> 41:17.042
you got to ad--
admit to me that...

41:17.075 --> 41:18.944
you were never gonna
bare your soul to me.

41:18.977 --> 41:21.613
Am I right?

41:24.650 --> 41:30.288
*

41:30.321 --> 41:33.659
- Yes, you are.

41:33.692 --> 41:35.527
- Okay.

41:35.561 --> 41:42.601
*

41:46.838 --> 41:48.674
Go inside.
It's cold.

41:48.707 --> 41:55.914
*

42:00.018 --> 42:07.225
*

42:20.138 --> 42:20.305
.

42:23.241 --> 42:30.248
*
