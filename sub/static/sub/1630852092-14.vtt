00:04.371 --> 00:06.638
<i>[Lisa] Most of the time I'm covered
up, and I really didn't even notice</i>

00:06.640 --> 00:09.375
<i>until my legs and feet and
stuff started hurting so bad.</i>

00:16.316 --> 00:19.051
<i>[woman 1] Somewhere in me is
this little glimmer of hope.</i>

00:19.053 --> 00:22.021
<i>I just wanna be a normal person.</i>

00:22.188 --> 00:23.288
[grunts]

00:23.356 --> 00:25.290
[panting]

00:32.766 --> 00:35.934
[man 1] You can't do it, and
then I just get mad. [crying]

00:35.936 --> 00:39.371
<i>[woman 2] If I don't make a change
now, I'm scared it's gonna be too late.</i>

00:43.576 --> 00:46.545
[groaning] It really hurts.

00:46.547 --> 00:49.148
<i>[woman 1] I refuse
to stop fighting.</i>

00:49.150 --> 00:51.984
<i>I have to do this
for my children.</i>

00:57.323 --> 01:00.859
I'm trying to tell y'all I've
needed help, but I want it.

01:00.861 --> 01:04.163
[Dr. Now through laptop] <i>Well, we're
giving you the help. You're not listening.</i>

01:28.421 --> 01:31.590
<i>[Lisa] I better say
I get up every morning.</i>

01:31.592 --> 01:35.294
<i>Except for the fact that I
can't get up out of this bed.</i>

01:35.995 --> 01:38.797
<i>It's been about three
years I've been in bed.</i>

01:38.799 --> 01:41.600
Randy. Randy,
it's time to get up.

01:41.602 --> 01:44.236
[coughing, groaning]

01:46.973 --> 01:50.843
It makes me feel [bleep]
because I can't do anything.

01:50.845 --> 01:52.878
[groans]

01:52.880 --> 01:56.949
<i>I hate being here. I hate
being in this house.</i>

01:56.951 --> 01:59.184
<i>'Cause I hate being
stuck in a house.</i>

01:59.586 --> 02:01.987
<i>I hate myself.</i>

02:01.989 --> 02:07.359
<i>I just feel like I have let myself
down and everybody around me.</i>

02:11.064 --> 02:13.665
<i>I live with my boyfriend, Randy</i>

02:13.667 --> 02:16.435
<i>and I just feel like crap because
we're not really boyfriend, girlfriend,</i>

02:16.437 --> 02:19.271
<i>he's more like my caregiver.</i>

02:19.273 --> 02:23.041
<i>For the three years I've been in
bed, Randy's been helping me.</i>

02:24.511 --> 02:26.278
Oh.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.948
<i>Randy does basically
everything for me.</i>

02:32.719 --> 02:35.621
- Babe, I'm getting hungry.
- [Randy] Okay.

02:35.623 --> 02:39.057
<i>[Lisa] Most of the time,
he does all the cooking.</i>

02:39.059 --> 02:43.195
<i>Wish I could help out a lot
more. I know Randy wants that.</i>

02:43.830 --> 02:45.864
<i>Poor guy.</i>

02:45.866 --> 02:48.433
<i>I miss simple things
like mopping a floor.</i>

02:48.435 --> 02:51.236
He just says he
does it out of love.

02:52.672 --> 02:56.108
[Randy] Well, for breakfast I
<i>cook her eggs and toast</i>

02:56.110 --> 03:00.546
<i>and give her cereal and
sometimes cottage cheese.</i>

03:00.548 --> 03:03.916
Makes me upset, because I
don't want her eating that stuff,

03:03.918 --> 03:05.751
but I don't wanna make her
mad, so I give it to her.

03:05.753 --> 03:08.387
<i>Lisa gets upset all the time,</i>

03:08.389 --> 03:10.556
<i>because she wants to get up
out of bed and do things,</i>

03:10.558 --> 03:12.491
<i>and she starts crying.</i>

03:12.493 --> 03:15.627
<i>It makes me upset, 'cause
I love her with all my heart.</i>

03:15.629 --> 03:20.032
<i>Sometimes I hug her and other
times I tell her, "Lisa, it'll be okay."</i>

03:20.034 --> 03:22.367
<i>I'm her biggest cheerleader.</i>

03:24.771 --> 03:28.874
<i>[Lisa] When you turn to food for
comfort, it's like your best friend.</i>

03:28.876 --> 03:32.978
<i>You know, you can eat it and
you can cuss while you're eating it,</i>

03:32.980 --> 03:35.681
<i>and tell 'em everything
you're doing, and</i>

03:35.683 --> 03:39.785
<i>it's not gonna talk back to you
and it's not gonna judge you.</i>

03:39.787 --> 03:41.153
<i>Food makes you feel good
while you're eating it.</i>

03:41.155 --> 03:43.455
It makes you happy.

03:43.457 --> 03:49.161
<i>But then by the time you're done, you
feel so guilty, it's like was it worth it?</i>

03:49.163 --> 03:52.598
For eating all that food 'cause
you know that food's killing you.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.934
<i>You know how bad it is?
It's absolutely terrible.</i>

03:55.936 --> 04:00.005
<i>And food becomes your best
friend, it's your only friend.</i>

04:00.707 --> 04:02.641
<i>But it's always there.</i>

04:02.643 --> 04:08.013
<i>I mean, I've tried like, not eating so much
and stuff like that, but I'm a stress eater,</i>

04:08.015 --> 04:10.382
<i>so whenever I'm stressed
out or something, I eat.</i>

04:10.650 --> 04:13.385
I'm just a stressful person.

04:13.387 --> 04:16.288
[coughing] Babe, you wanna put
that in the kitchen for me?

04:16.823 --> 04:18.357
Thank you.

04:23.396 --> 04:26.331
<i>I feel bad, 'cause sometimes
my bedding gets wet.</i>

04:26.333 --> 04:28.967
<i>And then we have
to change the bedding.</i>

04:28.969 --> 04:31.770
<i>- You know, it's kinda stressful.
- [Randy grunts]</i>

04:31.772 --> 04:34.206
<i>And I have to use the bathroom.</i>

04:34.208 --> 04:37.142
- [Randy grunts]
<i>- Puts stress on my body.</i>

04:39.646 --> 04:43.782
- [Randy] Try to lean. Just...
- Oh!

04:43.784 --> 04:46.018
You wanna get
as much as you can.

04:46.020 --> 04:47.719
We have to change the bedding.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.421
So, yeah, I'm stressed a lot.

04:50.790 --> 04:53.091
<i>And then if it's bath time,
we'll take a bath.</i>

04:54.127 --> 04:56.261
- You ready to roll over?
- Yeah.

04:57.463 --> 04:59.364
[Lisa groaning]

04:59.366 --> 05:04.169
Get some soap and rags and
wash my legs and rinse 'em off.

05:05.938 --> 05:11.043
<i>It's a long process, 'cause we have to
wash and then I have to dry everything.</i>

05:11.277 --> 05:14.046
Get that dead skin off.

05:14.048 --> 05:17.416
<i>I've always wanted to lose weight. I
just never knew how to lose weight.</i>

05:17.418 --> 05:19.351
<i>Nobody wants to be like this.</i>

05:19.585 --> 05:22.220
<i>And if they do, they're crazy.</i>

05:25.792 --> 05:29.928
I've always enjoyed food. I
don't know why but I always have.

05:29.930 --> 05:32.064
<i>I think it's been
a family thing, you know?</i>

05:32.066 --> 05:33.765
<i>All of us are overweight.</i>

05:33.767 --> 05:36.501
Lisa and I are two years apart.

05:36.503 --> 05:39.404
<i>We grew up together pretty
good, but growing up,</i>

05:39.406 --> 05:41.473
<i>we've never really
recognized Lisa's weight,</i>

05:41.475 --> 05:45.310
<i>'cause all of us was heavy back
then except for Robin, the other sister.</i>

05:47.146 --> 05:50.115
<i>[Lisa] Growing up,
my life was chaotic.</i>

05:50.550 --> 05:52.017
My dad was an alcoholic.

05:54.487 --> 05:58.457
<i>He wasn't at first. He was a real
good dad when we were younger,</i>

05:58.459 --> 06:03.028
but then he got into drinking and
started beating on my mom and everything.

06:03.996 --> 06:08.667
<i>So just that situation there
made me turn to food.</i>

06:08.669 --> 06:12.704
<i>Food became a comfort to me, 'cause
whenever I got upset, or afraid, or lonely,</i>

06:12.706 --> 06:13.838
<i>I knew it'd be there.</i>

06:13.840 --> 06:17.809
<i>But then after my dad left,
my mom went to work.</i>

06:17.811 --> 06:21.947
<i>She cleaned banks, she did
whatever she could to take care of us.</i>

06:21.949 --> 06:25.050
<i>And us kids used to spend
a lot of time home alone.</i>

06:25.052 --> 06:26.752
<i>Go do what we wanted to do.</i>

06:26.754 --> 06:28.353
Cry and eat.

06:29.389 --> 06:33.191
<i>When I was 13,
life changed a lot.</i>

06:33.193 --> 06:37.028
<i>I was at a friend's house,
people I thought were friends.</i>

06:37.030 --> 06:39.731
<i>But I was just at the wrong
place at the wrong time.</i>

06:39.733 --> 06:43.402
And I got raped.
And it just happened.

06:43.404 --> 06:46.538
<i>There was two different
guys. I never told a soul.</i>

06:46.540 --> 06:50.709
<i>Not even my mom. And I
started eating a lot after that.</i>

06:50.711 --> 06:53.678
<i>I know I did. I did it on purpose,
'cause I wanted to get fat</i>

06:53.680 --> 06:55.981
so nobody would
ever touch me again.

06:58.885 --> 07:03.688
<i>Made me feel lonely, afraid,
wondering why things happen,</i>

07:03.690 --> 07:06.558
and where in the hell was God?

07:06.560 --> 07:08.693
<i>I got to drinking then.</i>

07:08.695 --> 07:12.664
<i>Drinking and partying.
Following the crowd.</i>

07:12.666 --> 07:15.066
<i>Probably about 300 pounds.</i>

07:15.234 --> 07:19.404
<i>I met Matthew's dad
when I was 16. Terence.</i>

07:21.674 --> 07:26.445
<i>And it was okay. Me and him got along real
good. We had a pretty good relationship.</i>

07:26.447 --> 07:29.614
And then I found out
I was pregnant.

07:29.616 --> 07:33.985
<i>My sister just found out she was
pregnant with her second child.</i>

07:33.987 --> 07:38.723
<i>[Jojo] Oh, it was not good for my mom living
in a house with two pregnant girls, [laughs]</i>

07:38.725 --> 07:40.392
'Cause we was crabby
all the time.

07:40.394 --> 07:44.596
<i>And then we still lived with our
mom after we had the boys for a while.</i>

07:44.598 --> 07:47.499
What am I gonna do with a baby?
I'm 17, I can't take care of myself.

07:47.501 --> 07:52.904
<i>He had colic real bad and
he cried 24/7, so it was hard.</i>

07:52.906 --> 07:58.043
<i>Me and Terence were never married, but
we kinda got thrown together for a while.</i>

07:58.045 --> 08:01.513
My first marriage was
a guy that was in prison.

08:01.515 --> 08:03.748
He was in prison for murder.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.851
<i>We started dating after
he went to prison.</i>

08:05.853 --> 08:08.720
<i>He was young when
he killed the guy.</i>

08:08.722 --> 08:11.756
<i>They robbed a mall
and accidentally shot him.</i>

08:11.758 --> 08:13.425
At the time,
it didn't bother me.

08:13.427 --> 08:16.795
And when he got out, it
just didn't turn out well.

08:16.797 --> 08:21.233
<i>It was good the first, you
know, three months he was out,</i>

08:21.235 --> 08:24.803
<i>but then he got to drinking
and using a lot of drugs.</i>

08:24.805 --> 08:30.475
<i>Thought it was okay to talk to me
and hittin' on me and stuff like that.</i>

08:30.477 --> 08:32.477
<i>I picked him up one time
and body slammed him.</i>

08:32.479 --> 08:34.346
I said, you're not gonna
put your hands on me.

08:34.348 --> 08:36.748
I said, no man's ever gonna
put their hands on me again.

08:36.750 --> 08:41.286
And then he tried again and I
called the cops and had him removed.

08:41.288 --> 08:43.822
<i>Sent him back to
the penitentiary.</i>

08:43.824 --> 08:46.424
And I went and seen him, I
said, you might just file for divorce,

08:46.426 --> 08:49.027
because we're not
staying married.

08:49.395 --> 08:50.595
So he filed for one.

08:50.597 --> 08:53.598
<i>His biggest lie was,
I'm going down to the bar,</i>

08:53.600 --> 08:57.035
<i>and then he disappeared for
two weeks and I didn't see him.</i>

08:58.404 --> 09:02.374
I'm just gonna skip forward.
Then there was Homer.

09:02.608 --> 09:05.343
<i>I was 19.</i>

09:05.345 --> 09:09.748
<i>That was a good relationship, but
he was on drugs, so we broke up.</i>

09:09.750 --> 09:12.951
<i>Oh, then there was Charles, I
dated him for a couple years.</i>

09:12.985 --> 09:14.853
I was 21, I dated him.

09:14.855 --> 09:17.022
<i>We broke up 'cause
we just fought a lot.</i>

09:17.024 --> 09:19.624
<i>And then there was Harry,</i>

09:19.626 --> 09:22.193
<i>and I was like,
22 then, I think.</i>

09:22.195 --> 09:24.963
Harry was a good guy.
He was really sweet.

09:24.965 --> 09:27.899
But he was a womanizer. He got down three
or four different girlfriends at one time.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.068
I couldn't deal with that.

09:30.703 --> 09:33.972
<i>With Harry, things
started getting hard.</i>

09:33.974 --> 09:37.008
<i>'Cause it was just too hard
for me to go and do things.</i>

09:38.878 --> 09:41.079
<i>That was about ten years back.</i>

09:41.081 --> 09:42.914
<i>And then I got with Randy.</i>

09:42.916 --> 09:47.552
<i>I met Randy at the grocery store at age
40, he came up and started talking to me.</i>

09:47.554 --> 09:51.723
Gave him my phone number,
and I've been with Randy ever since.

09:51.725 --> 09:54.893
I don't think I was attracted
to Randy when I first met him.

09:54.895 --> 09:57.095
I think he just grew on me.

09:57.997 --> 10:00.231
He was just so sweet and kind.

10:10.276 --> 10:12.043
<i>I love everything about Lisa.</i>

10:12.045 --> 10:16.982
<i>I miss her being there with
me. That's how I feel about that.</i>

10:16.984 --> 10:20.518
<i>Well, we used to go down to the park, and
she'd hold onto the back of her wheelchair,</i>

10:20.520 --> 10:23.655
<i>and she'd walk around on that.</i>

10:23.657 --> 10:26.658
<i>We used to go fishing all the
time. She'd go to the store with me.</i>

10:26.660 --> 10:28.326
<i>She'd go to the
doctor's with me.</i>

10:28.328 --> 10:32.197
<i>I do feel lonely all the time when
I go out and she can't go with me.</i>

10:32.199 --> 10:35.634
<i>Especially when I go to the
doctor, I need her there for support.</i>

10:35.636 --> 10:39.604
<i>And my biggest hope and dream for her
is to get up out of bed and us go do stuff,</i>

10:39.606 --> 10:43.041
and eventually get married.

10:43.043 --> 10:47.712
<i>About eight, nine years, Randy
and I spent a lot... a lot of time</i>

10:47.714 --> 10:49.514
<i>going places and doing things.</i>

10:49.516 --> 10:51.349
<i>We were never home.</i>

10:52.785 --> 10:55.353
Most of the time, I'm covered
up, and I really didn't even,

10:55.355 --> 10:57.088
you know, look at myself.

10:57.090 --> 11:01.726
I don't really think I ever really
noticed it until my legs and feet and stuff

11:01.728 --> 11:04.062
<i>started hurting so bad.</i>

11:04.064 --> 11:06.831
And Matthew said
"Mom, you're getting fat."

11:06.833 --> 11:08.266
[laughing]

11:09.635 --> 11:11.903
[exclaiming]

11:11.905 --> 11:14.205
Randy... Randy, will you put
that in the kitchen, hon?

11:14.607 --> 11:16.174
[coughing]

11:19.912 --> 11:22.714
Doctor told me if I stood on my
ankle, I was gonna puncture the skin,

11:22.716 --> 11:25.450
the bones are gonna
go through my skin.

11:25.452 --> 11:28.953
Started staying in bed.
And I never got out of bed.

11:28.955 --> 11:32.390
<i>By that time, I know I had
to weigh about 600.</i>

11:32.392 --> 11:34.426
<i>Been here ever since.</i>

11:39.732 --> 11:42.300
<i>My boyfriend Randy has
to do a lot for me.</i>

11:42.302 --> 11:45.537
<i>And I feel bad,
'cause it's not fair to him.</i>

11:45.539 --> 11:48.606
<i>He shouldn't have to come home and clean
and he shouldn't have to come home and cook,</i>

11:48.608 --> 11:50.508
<i>and he shouldn't have to
take care of me.</i>

11:50.510 --> 11:52.677
<i>That's what I worry about
with this relationship,</i>

11:52.679 --> 11:55.013
<i>is that he's gonna
get tired and leave.</i>

11:55.815 --> 12:01.052
<i>But I don't know, if it was tables
were turned, I'd get tired of it.</i>

12:03.456 --> 12:04.989
<i>[Jojo] Randy takes really
good care of Lisa.</i>

12:04.991 --> 12:07.659
<i>He's here for her, and he
helps her, he baths her.</i>

12:07.661 --> 12:10.328
<i>Helps her with her blisters
on her legs and stuff.</i>

12:11.597 --> 12:13.331
<i>Worry about something
happening to him.</i>

12:13.333 --> 12:16.735
Then who's gonna be here
to take care of Lisa?

12:16.737 --> 12:19.304
Well, bring me the sour cream
and I'll mix it in this, then.

12:25.845 --> 12:28.680
You know the last three years
on him has been hell.

12:28.682 --> 12:31.983
He's had to take care
of me, and, you know,

12:32.384 --> 12:34.285
I regret letting this happen.

12:34.787 --> 12:36.921
<i>I wanna lose the weight.</i>

12:36.923 --> 12:38.623
Hey, babe, come grab
this stuff, will you?

12:40.826 --> 12:43.661
<i>[Randy] I feel like her caretaker
instead of her boyfriend so many times.</i>

12:43.663 --> 12:46.164
<i>And it's kinda frustrating.</i>

12:47.633 --> 12:51.703
I think both of us have had
food addiction since we've met.

12:51.705 --> 12:54.939
<i>I think we do, yes, we
both enable each other.</i>

13:01.180 --> 13:02.514
<i>[Lisa] It's hard,
because you're...</i>

13:02.516 --> 13:04.048
Thank you.

13:04.416 --> 13:07.685
<i>You spend a lot of time alone
'cause no one wants to be around ya.</i>

13:07.687 --> 13:11.256
<i>But my sister Robin and my
sister Jojo live here in town.</i>

13:11.258 --> 13:13.892
<i>We talk on the phone, mostly.</i>

13:13.894 --> 13:16.728
<i>They just don't like seeing me
in bed, so they don't come over.</i>

13:16.730 --> 13:19.397
Taters are pretty good.

13:19.399 --> 13:22.400
<i>[Jojo] Broke my heart, Lisa
did, when she got bedridden.</i>

13:23.402 --> 13:26.905
<i>She asks us to come over
sometimes and see her,</i>

13:26.907 --> 13:29.207
<i>and we don't come see Lisa
as much as we should do.</i>

13:29.209 --> 13:32.477
<i>It hurts. I don't like
seeing her like that.</i>

13:32.479 --> 13:36.447
I just hope that she can get out of
bed soon, and be able to get up again.

13:38.417 --> 13:42.420
<i>[Lisa] Yeah, I feel like I'm
just not worth their time.</i>

13:42.422 --> 13:45.089
<i>And that's terrible,
but it's the truth.</i>

13:47.359 --> 13:49.661
<i>My biggest fear is dying.</i>

13:49.663 --> 13:52.530
I wanna change my lifestyle to
get out of bed and do things,

13:52.532 --> 13:55.900
<i>and it's never too
late to keep trying,</i>

13:55.902 --> 13:58.169
<i>and if I don't try, then
where am I gonna get?</i>

13:58.171 --> 13:59.437
Here, babe, put that up.

14:05.878 --> 14:07.946
[Randy coughing]

14:29.134 --> 14:31.035
<i>Well, it scares me.</i>

14:32.438 --> 14:35.273
<i>All I'm gonna do is keep gaining
more weight and I'm not gonna be here.</i>

14:37.676 --> 14:41.412
But between me and God, I know I
can change this. I just have to do it.

14:41.947 --> 14:43.982
<i>I don't have a choice.</i>

14:44.817 --> 14:46.517
<i>I wanna change really bad.</i>

14:46.519 --> 14:50.088
<i>I want my life back.</i>

14:50.090 --> 14:53.491
I mean, I really... I must be pretty
bad if people don't wanna come visit me.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.660
[sniffling]

14:55.662 --> 14:58.429
I mean, it's nobody's fault but
my own that I put all this weight up

14:58.431 --> 15:00.331
and I winded up in this bed.

15:01.667 --> 15:04.002
- [beeping]
- Thank you.

15:08.741 --> 15:13.211
But I deserve to be happy
and I deserve to be free.

15:13.213 --> 15:17.115
<i>That's all I want. That's
why I wanna change.</i>

15:39.939 --> 15:44.008
- So when's your Dr. Now appointment?
- I think it's today. 4:00.

15:44.010 --> 15:45.777
Mmm-hmm. Are you nervous?

15:45.811 --> 15:48.012
Yeah, I'm nervous.

15:48.014 --> 15:50.982
You know this man's
gonna put down his foot.

15:51.650 --> 15:54.652
I hope to get down to Houston.

15:54.654 --> 15:57.622
I wanna make an appointment with
Dr. Now and talk to him face-to-face.

15:57.624 --> 16:00.658
I hope to get surgery one day.

16:00.660 --> 16:04.195
And I wanna know what I can and cannot
eat. Hopefully, he'll send me a list.

16:04.197 --> 16:06.965
And how much weight he's gonna make
me lose, 'cause you know they always do.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.333
Yeah.

16:09.835 --> 16:11.803
Probably gonna have you
lose a lot.

16:11.805 --> 16:15.373
[Lisa] <i>I'm very nervous
about Dr. Now's appointment.</i>

16:15.375 --> 16:18.509
I'm nervous because I don't
know what he's gonna tell me.

16:18.511 --> 16:21.913
<i>I think he's gonna tell
me to lose a lot of weight.</i>

16:21.915 --> 16:24.882
Heck, if I lose 100 pounds,
I might be able to get up.

16:24.884 --> 16:28.019
You can probably get up now,
we just gotta strengthen your legs.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.255
I'm afraid to put
weight on that ankle.

16:31.257 --> 16:32.590
Yeah, I know.

16:32.592 --> 16:35.994
Especially since that doctor
said I could bust that bone through.

16:37.629 --> 16:41.199
We hope she can get out of the
bed and see her grandkids.

16:49.842 --> 16:53.378
This is my last chance, well,
'cause if I don't do this, I'm gonna die.

16:54.113 --> 16:55.313
[Randy] Yeah, I know.

17:07.960 --> 17:11.262
[ringtone from laptop]

17:11.264 --> 17:12.296
[Dr. Now through laptop]
<i>Hi, Lisa.</i>

17:13.599 --> 17:15.400
- Hello.
<i>- How are you today?</i>

17:15.402 --> 17:18.403
- I'm fine, and you?
<i>- I'm good, thank you.</i>

17:18.405 --> 17:21.005
<i>- Well, nice to meet you.
- You, too.</i>

17:26.178 --> 17:28.012
- Yes, sir.
<i>- Okay.</i>

17:30.382 --> 17:32.050
637.

17:32.052 --> 17:35.853
<i>You look like you could be
a little bigger than that.</i>

17:35.855 --> 17:36.888
<i>So, how old are you?</i>

17:36.890 --> 17:38.656
I'm 51.

17:38.658 --> 17:41.559
<i>So, what is your mobility?</i>

17:41.561 --> 17:44.062
I don't...
I can't get out of bed

17:44.064 --> 17:46.097
unless I get someone to help
me get in a wheelchair.

17:46.099 --> 17:48.933
<i>So, how long
have you been in bed?</i>

17:48.935 --> 17:51.102
Um, three to four years.

17:51.104 --> 17:53.337
[Dr. Now speaking]

17:54.807 --> 17:56.874
No, I guess not.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.743
<i>So, you didn't know
what the problem was</i>

17:58.745 --> 18:00.778
<i>in three or four years?</i>

18:00.780 --> 18:02.814
Well, yeah, I knew I...
I like to snack a lot

18:02.816 --> 18:04.315
and eat a lot.

18:09.555 --> 18:12.156
Well, when I could get up
and walk, I'd get it myself,

18:12.158 --> 18:15.326
but now Randy brings me
everything I eat.

18:18.197 --> 18:19.363
<i>So...</i>

18:26.405 --> 18:28.206
Well, we... We...

18:30.943 --> 18:32.143
No...

18:34.279 --> 18:35.413
He...

18:37.950 --> 18:38.850
No...

18:38.852 --> 18:39.884
<i>Who cooks the food?</i>

18:39.886 --> 18:42.120
Randy and I cook it together.

18:42.122 --> 18:43.754
<i>How are you gonna
cook it in the bed?</i>

18:43.756 --> 18:45.189
I got an electric skillet

18:45.191 --> 18:47.859
that I sit on the side
of the bed and cook.

18:47.861 --> 18:50.394
<i>So you cook the food in the bed?</i>

18:50.396 --> 18:51.863
Well, yeah. I sit in the bed

18:51.865 --> 18:54.065
and put the skillet
on the side and cook.

18:54.132 --> 18:56.100
[Dr. Now speaking]

18:58.670 --> 19:00.371
- Yeah.
<i>- Okay.</i>

19:03.408 --> 19:05.977
I'm gonna follow whatever
you tell me to do

19:05.979 --> 19:06.777
and he's gonna make sure of it.

19:06.779 --> 19:08.312
[Dr. Now speaking]

19:14.019 --> 19:17.989
<i>Can you lower the camera
so we can see your legs?</i>

19:17.991 --> 19:19.857
<i>Have some better idea
of what's going on.</i>

19:19.859 --> 19:21.125
[Lisa] Oh.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.261
Can you hold that down there?

19:24.196 --> 19:25.429
[Lisa groans]

19:28.767 --> 19:33.204
<i>We just see part of your leg,
but not the entire foot.</i>

19:35.674 --> 19:37.441
I've got lymphedema bad, too.

19:38.744 --> 19:39.843
<i>[Dr. Now] I see that.</i>

19:40.979 --> 19:44.782
<i>And what is this tubing going?
That the oxygen?</i>

19:44.784 --> 19:46.918
Oh, no. That's a PureWick.

19:46.920 --> 19:49.287
So when I pee,
it goes in this tube.

19:50.055 --> 19:51.889
So I don't get wet.

19:51.891 --> 19:53.424
[Dr. Now speaking]

19:54.393 --> 19:55.793
Um...

19:56.461 --> 20:00.798
Randy help... We turn over
and use, like, a bedpan.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.634
<i>[Dr. Now] I see. So you have
a whole system figured out</i>

20:03.636 --> 20:05.870
<i>to keep you in bed all day.</i>

20:05.872 --> 20:08.873
<i>When was the last time
you were able to sit up</i>

20:08.875 --> 20:11.242
<i>and walk and get out of bed?</i>

20:11.843 --> 20:12.944
I haven't been able to walk,

20:12.946 --> 20:14.478
like I said, about three years.

20:14.480 --> 20:15.813
Three or four years.

20:15.815 --> 20:19.350
<i>So have you been in bed
for three, four years, and...</i>

20:24.723 --> 20:26.691
I don't really do anything
except leg exercises.

20:26.693 --> 20:28.693
I do them every day.

20:28.695 --> 20:31.996
<i>So, what is the plan for you
to get out of the bed?</i>

20:31.998 --> 20:34.432
Well, I'm hoping
to lose some weight

20:34.434 --> 20:37.702
and get some physical therapy
so I can get out of bed.

20:37.704 --> 20:39.804
<i>How do you think
that's gonna happen?</i>

20:39.806 --> 20:40.905
I'm gonna have to say
on a strict diet

20:40.907 --> 20:44.041
and stop eating food
I'm not supposed to eat.

20:44.676 --> 20:47.411
<i>You knew that
the past three or four years.</i>

20:47.413 --> 20:49.146
<i>And what you have done
to change that?</i>

20:49.148 --> 20:51.782
Yeah, I guess I haven't been
trying hard enough.

20:51.784 --> 20:52.850
I don't know.

20:52.852 --> 20:54.385
<i>What do you mean,
you don't know?</i>

20:54.387 --> 20:56.254
<i>You don't know
what the problem is?</i>

20:56.256 --> 20:57.688
Well, yeah, I know
what the problem is.

20:57.690 --> 21:00.424
I guess I just haven't
did anything about it.

21:00.426 --> 21:02.693
<i>So, what do you think
the problem is?</i>

21:02.728 --> 21:05.730
I eat too much.

21:05.732 --> 21:07.832
<i>So, how long have you known
that you're eating too much?</i>

21:07.834 --> 21:09.967
Oh, for a long time.

21:09.969 --> 21:12.937
<i>So, what is new today
after 51 years?</i>

21:13.538 --> 21:14.538
I don't wanna die.

21:14.540 --> 21:17.441
I wanna change my life
and get out of this bed.

21:17.443 --> 21:21.145
<i>You say that, but doing that
hasn't been important enough</i>

21:21.147 --> 21:24.148
<i>for you to start losing
weight before this point.</i>

21:24.150 --> 21:26.417
<i>So, you live in Nebraska?</i>

21:26.419 --> 21:27.551
Yes, sir.

21:27.619 --> 21:30.421
<i>Well, we don't have
any sort of transportation</i>

21:30.423 --> 21:32.623
<i>to take you to Houston
from there.</i>

21:32.625 --> 21:33.624
<i>If you want to come here,</i>

21:33.626 --> 21:36.394
<i>the goal for you
would be to drive down.</i>

21:36.396 --> 21:40.364
<i>But, for anybody at your size,
bedridden, and without</i>

21:40.366 --> 21:42.933
<i>medical supervision,
or a medical path forward</i>

21:42.935 --> 21:47.405
<i>it's going to be very risky
to come down to Houston.</i>

21:47.407 --> 21:48.639
<i>So, before you do that,</i>

21:48.641 --> 21:50.574
<i>you need to get out of that bed.</i>

21:50.576 --> 21:53.277
<i>It's the priority
before you do anything.</i>

21:53.279 --> 21:57.181
<i>And you can do that by
losing weight and exercising.</i>

21:57.183 --> 21:57.982
<i>Okay?</i>

21:57.984 --> 21:59.517
[Lisa] Okay.

21:59.519 --> 22:02.086
<i>So, I'm gonna email you
some information</i>

22:02.088 --> 22:04.388
<i>I'm gonna send you
some diet instructions</i>

22:04.390 --> 22:06.190
<i>that I want you to read.</i>

22:06.192 --> 22:07.491
Okay.

22:07.493 --> 22:10.728
<i>And follow that
on a daily basis.</i>

22:10.730 --> 22:15.132
<i>The diet is going to limit you
to 1,200 calories a day</i>

22:15.134 --> 22:18.469
<i>with focus on protein
and almost no carbs.</i>

22:18.471 --> 22:19.603
<i>But do you think</i>

22:19.605 --> 22:23.040
<i>your boyfriend's still
gonna be enabling you?</i>

22:23.042 --> 22:26.344
<i>Or he's gonna stick with
your healthy eating now?</i>

22:26.812 --> 22:28.679
What do you think, Eagle?

22:28.681 --> 22:30.414
Stick with the healthy eating
'cause I have to too.

22:31.583 --> 22:33.584
He said he's
gonna stick with it.

22:33.586 --> 22:37.021
<i>All right. Lisa, I want you
to stick with the diet</i>

22:37.023 --> 22:39.690
<i>and change
your eating habits quickly.</i>

22:39.692 --> 22:43.060
<i>When you're 637 pounds,</i>

22:43.062 --> 22:45.663
<i>if you stick with
the 1,200 calorie diet,</i>

22:45.665 --> 22:48.532
<i>you can easily be able to lose</i>

22:48.534 --> 22:51.235
<i>40 to 50 pounds a month.</i>

22:51.237 --> 22:54.872
<i>So in two months, you can
easily lose 100 pounds.</i>

22:54.874 --> 22:59.009
<i>But I'm only gonna ask you
to lose 75 in that time.</i>

22:59.011 --> 23:01.545
<i>I expect you to lose that much.</i>

23:01.547 --> 23:02.446
Okay.

23:02.448 --> 23:04.415
<i>And with what
I'm gonna send you,</i>

23:04.417 --> 23:08.152
<i>there is some exercises that
I want you to start doing</i>

23:08.154 --> 23:09.854
<i>and that you can do in the bed.</i>

23:09.856 --> 23:10.888
Okay.

23:10.890 --> 23:11.856
<i>And to improve your stamina.</i>

23:11.858 --> 23:12.923
<i>And, do you have</i>

23:12.958 --> 23:15.826
<i>any physical therapy
over there to help you?</i>

23:15.828 --> 23:17.561
<i>No, I don't have
physical therapy.</i>

23:17.563 --> 23:19.163
<i>Okay, so...</i>

23:22.701 --> 23:24.602
<i>to work with you to get you up.</i>

23:24.604 --> 23:26.971
<i>Can you sit up
on the side of bed?</i>

23:26.973 --> 23:30.274
I can if someone helps me
get on the side of the bed, yeah.

23:30.542 --> 23:31.542
<i>Okay.</i>

23:31.544 --> 23:33.878
<i>Okay, so, I want you
to work with that</i>

23:33.880 --> 23:36.313
<i>to sit up and to start
to stand again.</i>

23:36.315 --> 23:37.481
<i>And once you do that,</i>

23:37.483 --> 23:40.151
<i>it will help you to start
to take some steps</i>

23:40.153 --> 23:43.154
<i>until you're able
to walk again. Okay?</i>

23:43.156 --> 23:45.756
<i>Now, the question is,
can you do that?</i>

23:45.758 --> 23:46.457
Okay.

23:46.459 --> 23:47.491
<i>All right.</i>

23:47.493 --> 23:49.560
<i>Lisa, if you need anything,
give me a call,</i>

23:49.562 --> 23:51.862
<i>otherwise, I'll follow up
with you in two months</i>

23:51.864 --> 23:54.899
<i>and I want to be
75 pounds lighter.</i>

23:54.901 --> 23:57.968
<i>And I want you up
and walking by then.</i>

24:01.873 --> 24:03.307
Okay. Thank you for your help.

24:03.942 --> 24:04.975
<i>Okay. Bye-bye.</i>

24:04.977 --> 24:06.410
Bye-bye. Okay.

24:07.746 --> 24:09.180
He's right
about one thing, Randy.

24:09.182 --> 24:11.916
I'm gonna run out of time
if we don't do something.

24:11.918 --> 24:13.184
We're gonna do it.

24:14.052 --> 24:16.253
I'm so mad at myself.

24:16.755 --> 24:18.656
[deep breath]

24:18.658 --> 24:19.890
You can be mad at me,
not yourself.

24:19.892 --> 24:21.859
You did not
put that food in my mouth.

24:21.861 --> 24:24.261
Randy, how many times
do I have to tell you that?

24:24.263 --> 24:26.597
- Nobody did this to me but me.
- I gave it to you.

24:26.599 --> 24:27.431
So what?

24:27.999 --> 24:29.767
You can bring me
10 pizzas in here,

24:29.769 --> 24:31.569
but unless I choose to eat 'em,

24:31.571 --> 24:33.671
then I shouldn't be eating 'em.

24:33.673 --> 24:35.706
This is nobody's fault
but my own.

24:35.708 --> 24:37.842
I killed...
Basically killed myself.

24:37.844 --> 24:39.243
No, we both us killed you.

24:39.245 --> 24:41.145
No, I did.

24:43.582 --> 24:44.348
[sniffles]

24:44.350 --> 24:45.749
We're gonna get you out of this.

24:52.491 --> 24:57.394
Right now, I think we're gonna
have a bit of uphill battle with Lisa.

24:57.396 --> 24:59.964
<i>She's been stuck
in the bed for years</i>

24:59.966 --> 25:03.634
<i>with no ambition to get up
and change her situation.</i>

25:03.636 --> 25:05.936
<i>Which means that a part of her</i>

25:05.938 --> 25:08.906
<i>that wants her
to be in that bed all day</i>

25:08.908 --> 25:11.742
with someone feeding her
and taking care of her.

25:11.744 --> 25:13.777
<i>Which means she has spent</i>

25:13.779 --> 25:17.548
<i>a lot of time justifying
living like that to herself.</i>

25:17.550 --> 25:20.684
<i>So, changing that
isn't going to be easy,</i>

25:20.686 --> 25:23.020
<i>especially with the enabler
there with her,</i>

25:23.022 --> 25:25.556
<i>always ready to feed her.</i>

25:25.558 --> 25:27.424
<i>So, I'm not sure Lisa means it</i>

25:27.426 --> 25:29.860
when she says
she's ready to change.

25:29.862 --> 25:33.964
<i>My concern is, she really
means she's ready for someone</i>

25:33.966 --> 25:35.833
<i>to come and change
her situation.</i>

25:35.835 --> 25:37.835
<i>Hopefully, I'm wrong about that,</i>

25:37.837 --> 25:40.704
<i>and she's ready to work
to change her life.</i>

25:40.706 --> 25:43.908
Because, until she gets up
and starts walking again,

25:43.910 --> 25:46.944
<i>we're not gonna be able
to do much for her.</i>

25:46.946 --> 25:49.780
<i>In her condition,
bringing her to Houston</i>

25:49.782 --> 25:52.683
<i>could be too taxing on her body.</i>

25:52.685 --> 25:54.418
<i>So, we need
to get her weight down</i>

25:54.420 --> 25:56.587
<i>and get her mobile again</i>

25:56.589 --> 25:58.455
before we do
anything else for her.

25:58.457 --> 26:00.691
<i>But that's gonna be
all up to her.</i>

26:00.693 --> 26:03.827
<i>She's gonna have to decide
what's more important,</i>

26:03.829 --> 26:05.629
<i>stay in the bed
and eating all day,</i>

26:05.631 --> 26:06.964
<i>or saving her life.</i>

26:06.966 --> 26:10.501
<i>We will give her
the instructions and the tools</i>

26:10.503 --> 26:12.736
<i>to do what she needs to change.</i>

26:12.738 --> 26:15.339
But it is all up to her
to make it happen.

26:25.550 --> 26:26.850
I'm gonna go to the store.

26:26.852 --> 26:29.019
- All right. Bye, I love you.
- I love you.

26:37.662 --> 26:38.795
<i>[Lisa] It's been a couple weeks</i>

26:38.997 --> 26:41.632
<i>since I had my first
appointment with Dr. Now.</i>

26:41.634 --> 26:42.933
<i>I've read Dr. Now's book</i>

26:42.935 --> 26:45.436
to see what kind of changes
I have to make.

26:45.438 --> 26:47.338
<i>The diet is confusing.</i>

26:47.340 --> 26:51.075
<i>He wants me to eat
a lot of protein, no carbs.</i>

26:51.077 --> 26:54.445
<i>But, he don't want me to eat,
like, fat stuff, you know,</i>

26:54.447 --> 26:57.014
<i>like a lot of hamburger.</i>

26:57.016 --> 26:58.816
<i>My sister Robin
cleaned my house out for me.</i>

26:58.818 --> 27:00.951
<i>Got rid of all the junk food.</i>

27:00.953 --> 27:03.253
<i>I filled my kitchen
with healthy stuff.</i>

27:03.888 --> 27:04.888
<i>Whatever.</i>

27:05.190 --> 27:07.658
<i>I'm just gonna,
like I said, pray to God</i>

27:07.660 --> 27:10.527
<i>and hope that Randy
will help me figure out</i>

27:10.529 --> 27:12.763
<i>what to eat, what not to eat,
and the servings</i>

27:12.765 --> 27:15.265
<i>and we can
make this work together.</i>

27:19.771 --> 27:21.205
[cell phone ringing]

27:22.107 --> 27:23.307
[cell phone ringing]

27:26.011 --> 27:27.311
Hi, honey.

27:27.779 --> 27:29.780
What do you wanna get?

27:29.782 --> 27:32.716
[yawns] I don't know.
Go get some cookies.

27:32.718 --> 27:34.051
[Randy] How may do you want?

27:34.053 --> 27:35.719
Get like six or seven cookies.

27:35.721 --> 27:37.354
Get some peanut butter cookies.

27:41.926 --> 27:43.894
A six pack of 'em
if they got 'em.

27:43.896 --> 27:47.731
Do you want bacon cheddar?
You want jalapeño cheddar?

27:47.733 --> 27:49.400
Just grab one of each one.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.003
Go get some cereal too, babe.

27:53.005 --> 27:55.472
<i>We need about
seven boxes of cereal,</i>

27:55.474 --> 27:57.508
so can you check
what you throw in there?

27:57.510 --> 27:59.710
<i>Get some...
Something with sugar on it.</i>

27:59.712 --> 28:01.712
<i>Since you're standing
right there.</i>

28:01.714 --> 28:04.214
Get some of that peanut butter
right up there.

28:05.450 --> 28:06.784
<i>Okay, now go to the candy aisle</i>

28:06.786 --> 28:09.319
<i>and then we're gonna
go to the chip aisle.</i>

28:09.321 --> 28:10.954
[Randy] I'm at
the chip aisle right now.

28:10.956 --> 28:13.390
<i>[Lisa] Oh, well get chips
while you're standing there.</i>

28:13.392 --> 28:15.726
Um, I don't know.
Get five bags.

28:15.728 --> 28:18.362
<i>You might just get a couple
jars of that dip, too.</i>

28:19.798 --> 28:20.964
<i>[Randy] All right,
what else do you need?</i>

28:20.966 --> 28:22.399
Go to the soda isle.

28:22.401 --> 28:25.669
<i>Get like eight cases of pop.</i>

28:25.671 --> 28:28.839
Just grab any of it.
It'll get drinken.

28:28.841 --> 28:30.974
<i>Okay, and then go over
and get, like,</i>

28:30.976 --> 28:32.009
<i>six frozen pizzas.</i>

28:32.011 --> 28:33.644
And get a pack
of corn dogs, too.

28:33.646 --> 28:35.913
I don't see corn dogs.

28:35.915 --> 28:39.016
All right, just grab four bags of
pizza roll and get out of there.

28:42.887 --> 28:43.921
All right, I'm leaving.

28:43.923 --> 28:45.055
<i>[Lisa] All right, babe.
That's all we need,</i>

28:45.057 --> 28:47.825
so I'm gonna see you
when you get here.

28:47.827 --> 28:48.659
<i>[Randy on device] All right.</i>

28:48.661 --> 28:50.060
Okay. Love you, bye.

28:52.764 --> 28:55.165
<i>Well, I can do
the exercise and diet</i>

28:55.167 --> 28:57.301
<i>Dr. Now wants me to do.</i>

29:02.407 --> 29:04.208
<i>But, not today.</i>

29:27.632 --> 29:30.200
Uh, Randy, can you hand me
them dumbbells, weights,

29:30.202 --> 29:32.136
whatever they're called
over there?

29:32.871 --> 29:34.071
[sighs]

29:34.706 --> 29:35.839
[clears throat]

29:35.841 --> 29:39.743
<i>It's been about a month
since I talked to Dr. Now.</i>

29:39.745 --> 29:42.746
<i>I got Dr. Now's books
and the paper he sent.</i>

29:42.748 --> 29:46.216
<i>Yes, I understand everything
they want me to do.</i>

29:46.218 --> 29:49.720
I'd like to get my exercising
back up to twice a day.

29:49.722 --> 29:51.789
<i>I mean, I really do
have to exercise my legs</i>

29:51.791 --> 29:53.657
'cause I'll get
a blood clot if I don't.

29:53.659 --> 29:55.793
My arms are gonna hurt tomorrow.

29:55.795 --> 29:57.761
<i>I'm stuck in bed all the time.</i>

29:57.763 --> 30:00.230
I haven't walked in four years.

30:00.232 --> 30:02.833
I can't even stand on my
poor feet, they hurt so bad.

30:02.867 --> 30:04.668
<i>But...</i>

30:04.670 --> 30:07.871
<i>I feel like if I can
lose enough weight,</i>

30:07.873 --> 30:09.706
at least trying
to get on my feet,

30:09.708 --> 30:11.041
I could do it.

30:12.110 --> 30:14.044
You want one to work with me?

30:14.179 --> 30:15.312
[sighs]

30:16.247 --> 30:17.815
[huffs]

30:17.882 --> 30:19.783
[groans]

30:19.785 --> 30:21.585
<i>If I were to
get out of bed right now,</i>

30:21.587 --> 30:23.520
my legs and knees
wouldn't hold my weight

30:23.522 --> 30:25.389
and I would just
fall on the floor.

30:25.391 --> 30:27.825
<i>I was in a nursing home
for about three months</i>

30:27.827 --> 30:31.895
<i>and we tried that and that's
just exactly what happened.</i>

30:31.897 --> 30:33.897
And I ain't gonna lie to you,
I'm gonna tell you

30:33.899 --> 30:35.365
I ain't... I'm scared to...

30:35.367 --> 30:36.433
put my feet on the floor

30:36.435 --> 30:39.002
and try again,
but I know I got to.

30:39.004 --> 30:41.905
And with the grace of God,
it's gonna work out okay.

30:41.907 --> 30:45.676
I just want a reason why I
wanna go see Dr. Now so bad.

30:45.678 --> 30:46.977
'Cause not only
would it help me lose weight,

30:46.979 --> 30:49.980
but I know he'll
get me physical therapy

30:49.982 --> 30:51.415
and start getting me
back on my feet,

30:51.417 --> 30:53.016
which I got to do that.

30:53.018 --> 30:55.052
Randy, my arms hurt.

30:56.187 --> 30:58.422
Ah. I know, your chest hurts.

30:58.623 --> 31:00.991
[sighs]

31:00.993 --> 31:03.260
I keep telling you to go into
the doctor, but you won't go.

31:04.062 --> 31:05.395
<i>I love Randy 'cause</i>

31:05.397 --> 31:08.765
we've been together forever
and he's really good to me.

31:08.767 --> 31:12.069
<i>He does a lot of stuff that
a lot of men wouldn't do.</i>

31:12.804 --> 31:14.805
And I appreciate him for it.

31:14.807 --> 31:17.241
You wanna go
to the hospital, baby?

31:20.945 --> 31:24.014
Lay down for a little bit
and see if that'll help out.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.889
<i>[Lisa] I don't
think Randy's jealous.</i>

31:31.891 --> 31:35.525
He's afraid if I lose weight
that I'll leave him.

31:35.527 --> 31:38.462
<i>'Cause then I won't...
I won't need him, you know.</i>

31:38.464 --> 31:40.898
<i>Right now he does
basically everything for me</i>

31:40.900 --> 31:42.299
<i>and if I can start doing
by myself, then...</i>

31:43.001 --> 31:43.967
I think he's gonna feel like

31:43.969 --> 31:45.669
I'm not gonna need him anymore.

31:45.671 --> 31:47.504
But, I mean, that's not the case

31:47.506 --> 31:49.840
'cause when we first meet
I did everything for myself.

31:49.842 --> 31:51.775
<i>We've got different
personalities, though.</i>

31:51.777 --> 31:54.845
He's really quiet
and doesn't talk to people.

31:54.847 --> 31:57.648
He's not around people
and I'm the opposite.

31:57.650 --> 31:58.916
I like to be around people

31:58.918 --> 32:01.985
and I like to go out
and do things.

32:02.086 --> 32:03.954
And he's not like that.

32:04.555 --> 32:05.923
And you know damn, damn well,

32:05.925 --> 32:08.025
I lose some weight,
my butt's going out.

32:08.027 --> 32:08.926
[laughs]

32:08.928 --> 32:10.827
See ya! [laughs]

32:10.862 --> 32:11.862
<i>I tell him every day</i>

32:11.930 --> 32:15.632
<i>my expectations for myself
in one year,</i>

32:15.634 --> 32:19.403
is to lose enough weight
to get out of this bed

32:19.405 --> 32:20.837
'cause I got a date
with my granddaughter

32:20.839 --> 32:22.773
to take her to the fair.

32:22.775 --> 32:25.075
And I do not plan on
missing that date.

32:26.177 --> 32:29.046
So, that's, that's my plans.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.632
I'm doing this.

32:48.634 --> 32:51.935
- There you go.
- For Dr. Now, but mainly me.

32:51.937 --> 32:54.004
- Keep it up.
- My arms are killing me.

32:55.039 --> 32:56.306
[grunts]

33:07.518 --> 33:09.886
Hello Dr. Now. How are you?

33:09.888 --> 33:12.389
<i>Good, Lisa.
What are you doing in bed?</i>

33:12.724 --> 33:15.125
Sitting here, doing nothing.

33:15.127 --> 33:16.827
<i>[Dr. Now] That's the problem
I'm calling about.</i>

33:16.829 --> 33:19.229
<i>You keep refusing PT</i>

33:19.231 --> 33:21.531
<i>and you're not
working with them to get up.</i>

33:21.533 --> 33:24.468
<i>So, last time I talked to you,
you said you could sit</i>

33:24.470 --> 33:27.337
<i>and get to the side of the bed
if you had help.</i>

33:27.339 --> 33:30.974
<i>And we sent PT to help you
start to do that</i>

33:30.976 --> 33:32.876
<i>to build up your stamina,</i>

33:32.878 --> 33:35.045
<i>but you refuse
to cooperate with them.</i>

33:35.047 --> 33:36.446
<i>So, what's going on?</i>

33:36.448 --> 33:38.915
I never said I'd
sit on the side of the bed.

33:38.917 --> 33:40.951
You must have gotten me
confused with someone else.

33:40.953 --> 33:41.752
<i>Really?</i>

33:41.754 --> 33:42.819
[chucking] Yeah.

33:42.821 --> 33:45.389
<i>[Dr. Now] So if you can't
get up and walk,</i>

33:45.391 --> 33:47.891
<i>how do you expect
to come to Houston?</i>

33:47.893 --> 33:50.694
I'm supposed to be
coming tomorrow.

33:50.696 --> 33:52.662
<i>How in the world?
You're in the bed.</i>

33:52.664 --> 33:53.830
<i>Are you gonna come with the bed?</i>

33:53.832 --> 33:56.066
<i>Move that bed from, uh...</i>

33:56.068 --> 33:57.634
<i>where you are to Houston?</i>

33:57.636 --> 33:59.803
No, they're...
The ambulance people

33:59.805 --> 34:00.837
are gonna help me get in the van

34:00.839 --> 34:03.407
and then I'm gonna come
down there and see you.

34:03.409 --> 34:07.644
<i>That's medical transport and
I told you that's too risky.</i>

34:07.646 --> 34:12.182
<i>But that's okay. I don't think you
are really planning on doing that.</i>

34:12.184 --> 34:15.919
<i>So, what you have done
to change your eating habits</i>

34:15.921 --> 34:17.187
<i>and lose some weight?</i>

34:17.189 --> 34:20.657
<i>I send you my book and all
the instructions you need.</i>

34:20.659 --> 34:23.093
I don't quite
understand your book

34:23.095 --> 34:25.695
and what kind of diet
you want me to be on.

34:25.697 --> 34:27.497
<i>Then you haven't read it</i>

34:27.499 --> 34:30.901
<i>because there is
only one diet in there.</i>

34:30.903 --> 34:33.570
<i>If you read the stuff,
but you won't understand</i>

34:33.572 --> 34:35.405
<i>that you eat
only three times a day?</i>

34:35.407 --> 34:38.742
<i>Only about 400 calorie at a time</i>

34:38.744 --> 34:43.947
<i>and you avoid the high calorie
food list that we sent you.</i>

34:43.949 --> 34:46.650
<i>Which part of that
is hard to understand?</i>

34:46.652 --> 34:49.419
I'm confused
all the way around, I guess.

34:49.421 --> 34:50.587
<i>You're... you're confused.</i>

34:50.589 --> 34:53.423
<i>Okay, okay. I think
what we have here</i>

34:53.425 --> 34:57.127
<i>is you're playing games
and pretending to be confused.</i>

34:57.129 --> 34:59.463
<i>Because you still want to eat</i>

34:59.465 --> 35:01.731
<i>whatever you want
whenever you want.</i>

35:01.733 --> 35:05.702
<i>So, we need to cut
the food off at the source.</i>

35:05.704 --> 35:07.704
<i>Where is your enabler boyfriend</i>

35:07.706 --> 35:11.775
<i>so I can talk him and see
why things are repeating?</i>

35:11.777 --> 35:14.311
Just a minute.
I'll hand him the computer.

35:15.847 --> 35:17.080
Here, babe.

35:17.281 --> 35:18.115
<i>[Dr. Now] Hello.</i>

35:18.117 --> 35:19.816
Hello.

35:19.818 --> 35:20.617
<i>How are you doing?</i>

35:20.619 --> 35:21.985
Fine.

35:21.987 --> 35:24.654
<i>So, you're the one
who brings Lisa</i>

35:24.656 --> 35:26.723
<i>all the food that she can get.</i>

35:26.725 --> 35:28.425
<i>So, why are you doing that?</i>

35:28.427 --> 35:29.860
I don't bring her a whole lot.

35:29.862 --> 35:31.895
I bring her some.

35:31.897 --> 35:34.397
<i>[Dr. Now] She hasn't lost
any weight over the last month.</i>

35:34.399 --> 35:36.766
<i>She's still over 600 pounds.</i>

35:36.768 --> 35:40.370
<i>So you're not feeding her a
little, you're feeding her a lot.</i>

35:40.372 --> 35:43.640
<i>If you give her
appropriate amount,</i>

35:43.642 --> 35:46.910
<i>then she should be able to lose
enough weight to get out of the bed.</i>

35:46.912 --> 35:48.879
<i>But she's not able to do that.</i>

35:48.881 --> 35:51.948
<i>So are you overfeeding her?</i>

35:52.283 --> 35:55.952
If she asks me if
I can get it for her.

35:55.954 --> 36:00.223
<i>- So if she asks you, you're obligated to bring it to her?
- Yes.</i>

36:01.359 --> 36:03.059
<i>What happens if you
don't bring it?</i>

36:03.061 --> 36:03.827
<i>- Is she gonna get up and go get it?
- You talk.</i>

36:03.829 --> 36:06.963
I can't talk to him.
He's an [bleep].

36:06.965 --> 36:10.967
[Lisa] Randy, you have to talk
to him because this is important.

36:10.969 --> 36:13.970
This is about saving my life,
you can't just not talk to the man.

36:13.972 --> 36:16.173
I'm trying not to overfeed you.

36:21.078 --> 36:23.180
You need to finish
talking to him.

36:24.782 --> 36:26.249
I'm done talking to him.

36:26.251 --> 36:29.819
We both know we're both
doing wrong, so I mean...

36:29.821 --> 36:32.489
- He's only trying to help us.
- Well, we can do it without him.

36:32.491 --> 36:34.424
It's okay 'cause you down there.

36:34.426 --> 36:37.027
I've been trying to cut your
food down and tell you no.

36:40.631 --> 36:42.732
Dr. Now, he don't want
to talk to you no more.

36:42.734 --> 36:44.868
<i>[Dr. Now] But that may
be your problem,</i>

36:44.870 --> 36:48.104
<i>that you got some enabler
to bring you a lot of food,</i>

36:48.106 --> 36:49.472
<i>and he doesn't want
to stop doing that</i>

36:49.474 --> 36:53.810
<i>because he likes to overfeed
you for whatever reason.</i>

36:53.812 --> 36:57.747
<i>And, as long as he brings it to
you, then you're gonna be in the bed.</i>

36:57.749 --> 37:00.383
<i>And if you both aren't
willing to stop</i>

37:00.385 --> 37:03.887
<i>this unhealthy behavior,
nothing is gonna change.</i>

37:03.889 --> 37:07.424
<i>And if that's the case, what is
the point of you coming to see us?</i>

37:07.426 --> 37:11.561
<i>What do you think we're gonna to
do? Magically make you lose weight?</i>

37:11.563 --> 37:14.130
Well, no, I know you're not
gonna magically reduce weight.

37:14.132 --> 37:16.766
That I'm gotta do it myself,
and he's gonna have to...

37:16.768 --> 37:18.668
Help me do it.

37:18.670 --> 37:22.105
<i>[Dr. Now] And you don't have
a lot of time to waste.</i>

37:23.007 --> 37:25.442
<i>And you're gonna run
out of time soon.</i>

37:26.277 --> 37:28.111
I know.

37:29.880 --> 37:33.283
<i>[Dr. Now] Now, if you know, you're gonna
have to do your part to make the changes.</i>

37:33.285 --> 37:34.951
[Lisa] Okay.

37:35.720 --> 37:39.322
<i>You say that, but I don't think you
mean it, or that you really want help.</i>

37:40.424 --> 37:41.725
He doesn't make sense.

37:41.727 --> 37:44.494
<i>[Dr. Now] So what did
your friend just say, Lisa?</i>

37:44.496 --> 37:48.665
[crying] I'm trying to tell you I
don't need help, but I want it.

37:48.667 --> 37:50.500
<i>[Dr. Now] Well,
the help that you want</i>

37:50.502 --> 37:51.735
<i>we've given you the help,
you're not taking it.</i>

37:51.737 --> 37:54.771
<i>The help you want
is to stop eating</i>

37:54.773 --> 37:57.741
<i>and stop overeating and
killing yourself with food.</i>

37:57.743 --> 38:00.710
<i>And we give you
the opportunity to do that,</i>

38:00.712 --> 38:03.113
<i>and you're not doing that
and you want us to help you.</i>

38:03.115 --> 38:05.315
I'm doing the best I can.

38:06.884 --> 38:08.351
[crying]

38:13.024 --> 38:15.091
- [sniffles]
<i>- [Dr. Now] Lisa.</i>

38:16.327 --> 38:19.029
- Yeah.
<i>- [Dr. Now] Don't cry.</i>

38:19.031 --> 38:23.700
<i>Crying and throwing a tantrum is not
gonna be a solution for the problem.</i>

38:23.702 --> 38:26.436
I'm not throwing
no tantrum, Dr. Now.

38:26.438 --> 38:30.507
<i>But you are. You know,
we gave you all you need</i>

38:30.509 --> 38:35.912
<i>to start making the changes you
need, and you've had every opportunity</i>

38:35.914 --> 38:40.383
<i>to make progress this past month,
so why you haven't done that?</i>

38:40.751 --> 38:42.252
I don't know.

38:44.422 --> 38:46.956
<i>[Dr. Now] Well, what is
the point of calling us</i>

38:46.958 --> 38:49.659
<i>and you're not doing anything
you're supposed to do?</i>

38:49.694 --> 38:51.428
I do want the help.

38:51.430 --> 38:53.229
<i>So what kind of help
do you need?</i>

38:55.599 --> 39:00.470
I don't know, Dr. Now. I just know I need help
losing weight and getting out of this bed.

39:00.472 --> 39:03.073
<i>We send you the diet,
you need to do it,</i>

39:03.075 --> 39:06.109
<i>and work with PT,
if you want any more help.</i>

39:06.111 --> 39:08.578
<i>You think you can do that?</i>

39:08.580 --> 39:10.947
Yeah, I can do that.

39:10.949 --> 39:12.982
<i>Well, let me talk to him again.</i>

39:13.751 --> 39:15.118
Here, Randy.

39:16.087 --> 39:17.287
[clears throat]

39:18.789 --> 39:20.457
- Yeah.
- [Lisa coughs]

39:20.459 --> 39:22.025
<i>[Dr. Now] Can we
get an agreement</i>

39:22.027 --> 39:23.760
<i>that there will be no snacking
between the meal?</i>

39:23.762 --> 39:26.062
Yes.

39:26.064 --> 39:30.367
<i>Okay. And the meal needs
to be around 400 calories.</i>

39:30.601 --> 39:32.836
Okay.

39:32.838 --> 39:36.039
<i>Lisa, do you think you can
do that chapter in the book?</i>

39:36.041 --> 39:40.143
<i>- Chapter one?
- Yes. Yeah, I can.</i>

39:40.145 --> 39:42.779
<i>Okay, and you need to do
that chapter plan,</i>

39:42.781 --> 39:46.716
<i>- and start doing that exercise, okay?
- Okay.</i>

39:46.718 --> 39:50.687
<i>- And when PT comes, you work with them.
- Okay.</i>

39:50.689 --> 39:53.156
<i>Okay, I'll follow up
in two months.</i>

39:53.158 --> 39:56.893
<i>And if you lose the weight
and get out of the bed,</i>

39:56.895 --> 40:00.764
<i>and if you get to that point maybe then we
can consider put you to trial to Houston.</i>

40:00.766 --> 40:02.399
All right.

40:02.401 --> 40:05.368
<i>Otherwise, I don't see
any point coming down here.</i>

40:05.870 --> 40:07.303
Okay.

40:07.305 --> 40:09.339
<i>- All right. Bye, Lisa.
- Bye-bye.</i>

40:09.341 --> 40:13.042
<i>- All right. Can I say bye to Randy?
- [Lisa] Okay.</i>

40:15.179 --> 40:19.883
<i>- Okay, Randy. If you need anything, give me a call.
- Okay.</i>

40:19.885 --> 40:23.787
<i>And let's stick to the program and
help her to lose some weight, okay?</i>

40:23.789 --> 40:25.188
Okay.

40:25.190 --> 40:26.823
<i>If you need anything,
give me a call.</i>

40:26.825 --> 40:27.524
- I will.
<i>- Bye, Randy.</i>

40:27.526 --> 40:29.359
- Bye. Bye.
<i>- Bye.</i>

40:43.607 --> 40:46.676
If Lisa doesn't wake up
and stop playing games,

40:46.678 --> 40:49.779
<i>then the outcome isn't
gonna be good for her.</i>

40:49.781 --> 40:52.682
<i>She's spent a lot of time
learning to manipulate</i>

40:52.684 --> 40:54.884
<i>those around her
to get what she wants.</i>

40:54.886 --> 40:59.856
<i>And she seems to think she can
keep doing that in this situation.</i>

40:59.858 --> 41:02.325
She wants to pretend
she doesn't know what to do,

41:02.327 --> 41:04.761
<i>and convince me
that she's trying,</i>

41:04.763 --> 41:08.865
<i>in the hope that I will eventually
give her weight loss surgery</i>

41:08.867 --> 41:10.967
<i>and all the work will
be done for her.</i>

41:10.969 --> 41:12.635
<i>But that's not gonna happen.</i>

41:12.637 --> 41:14.804
Because unless she
does the work,

41:14.806 --> 41:18.341
<i>nothing anyone does will
help her in the long run.</i>

41:18.343 --> 41:20.543
<i>So she's not gonna
manipulate her way</i>

41:20.545 --> 41:22.879
<i>into losing the weight
and walking again.</i>

41:22.881 --> 41:26.649
Either she does what she has
to do and work at it,

41:26.651 --> 41:29.919
<i>or her situation is
only gonna get worse,</i>

41:29.921 --> 41:34.958
until she gets to the point where it is
too late for her and she doesn't make it.

41:34.960 --> 41:37.293
<i>The choice is up to her.</i>

42:00.818 --> 42:03.086
I don't wanna go over
anything with her.

42:03.088 --> 42:05.121
I think it's a waste of time.

42:07.224 --> 42:08.324
[knocking at door]

42:08.959 --> 42:10.126
Come in!

42:11.829 --> 42:13.363
- Hi.
- [Lisa] Hello.

42:13.931 --> 42:16.432
- How are you, Lisa?
- I'm all right.

42:17.635 --> 42:21.404
I'm Emily. I'm a dietician.
I'm from Lincoln.

42:21.406 --> 42:23.473
- How's your day going so far?
- Fine.

42:23.475 --> 42:26.476
I probably won't even answer
your questions, to be honest with ya.

42:26.478 --> 42:30.513
I just wanna get to know you a little bit,
okay? Can you tell me about yourself?

42:30.515 --> 42:33.917
I don't know. Ain't
really nothing to tell.

42:33.919 --> 42:36.052
Well, we didn't just end up
here today, right?

42:36.119 --> 42:37.320
No.

42:37.955 --> 42:39.255
What's some of your story?

42:39.456 --> 42:42.859
Um, I don't know.

42:42.861 --> 42:46.396
Can you tell me about just growing
up, and what food was like for you?

42:47.731 --> 42:49.198
I don't know.

42:49.200 --> 42:52.735
- We ate... Regular meals.
- Yeah.

42:52.737 --> 42:55.505
Did you get the diet
that Dr. Now had...

42:55.507 --> 42:57.373
- No.
- provided?

42:57.375 --> 42:59.409
- I never got no diet.
- You didn't get any information from him?

42:59.411 --> 43:01.244
No diet, no nothing.

43:02.646 --> 43:04.781
Okay. You haven't
talked to him at all?

43:04.783 --> 43:06.816
- Yeah, I've talked to him.
- Okay.

43:06.818 --> 43:09.786
What has he provided you
when you, uh, met with him?

43:09.788 --> 43:11.220
Nothing but rudeness.

43:11.956 --> 43:14.190
- Mmm-hmm.
- Okay.

43:14.592 --> 43:17.293
I refuse to talk
to that man again, too.

43:18.562 --> 43:20.630
I don't need to be made
like I'm a piece of [bleep]

43:20.632 --> 43:23.866
from someone who is
supposed to be helping me.

43:23.868 --> 43:26.569
- You're not a piece of [bleep].
- [coughing] Well...

43:26.571 --> 43:28.705
That's not how they
make you feel.

43:28.707 --> 43:31.841
Um, what's the ultimate
goal for you?

43:31.843 --> 43:34.510
- I just wanna get out of this bed.
- Okay.

43:34.512 --> 43:38.414
So to get out of bed,
what would that entail?

43:38.416 --> 43:41.951
- I don't know. Figuring out how get up and walk again.
- Okay.

43:41.953 --> 43:44.087
So what would need
to happen in your life

43:44.089 --> 43:45.922
to be able to get up
and walk again?

43:45.924 --> 43:47.390
I don't know.

43:50.628 --> 43:52.862
- What types of things do you like to snack on?
- [sniffles]

43:52.864 --> 43:57.734
[crying] Just depends on whatever
is around. I don't have a choice!

43:57.736 --> 44:00.303
Okay, so what kinda foods
get brought into the house?

44:00.638 --> 44:02.939
Oh, hell. I don't know.

44:02.941 --> 44:04.807
Well, what do you eat
on a day-to-day basis?

44:04.809 --> 44:08.444
I don't know, I had oatmeal
and toast for breakfast.

44:08.446 --> 44:11.714
You like to eat snack food,
so what type of snack food?

44:11.716 --> 44:17.053
I don't know. I don't eat chips,
I used to never... I don't know.

44:17.888 --> 44:20.657
I don't know. I don't know
what the [bleep] I eat.

44:20.659 --> 44:23.026
I just eat whatever
people give me.

44:26.764 --> 44:29.666
Lisa, do you mind if I ask
Randy some questions?

44:29.668 --> 44:31.601
- Ask all you want.
- Okay.

44:31.603 --> 44:33.569
[Randy] I'm not answering
a [bleep] thing.

44:33.571 --> 44:35.071
[Emily] Randy, are you familiar

44:35.073 --> 44:38.408
with the recommendation
that Dr. Now has made?

44:38.842 --> 44:39.776
[Emily] No? Okay.

44:39.778 --> 44:41.778
He hasn't made none.
He doesn't...

44:41.780 --> 44:44.881
- Okay. Okay.
- do anything but make you feel like a piece of [bleep].

44:44.883 --> 44:46.416
Can I tell you about
those recommendations?

44:46.984 --> 44:48.084
No.

44:48.719 --> 44:49.752
[Emily] So...

44:49.754 --> 44:52.088
I think the overall goal is

44:52.090 --> 44:53.890
that we're promoting
some weight loss,

44:53.892 --> 44:56.159
to be able to help get you
to Houston to get help.

44:56.161 --> 44:57.326
Is that correct?

44:57.828 --> 45:00.463
- I'm not going to Houston.
- Okay.

45:00.465 --> 45:03.566
So, overall though, you have
the goal of your wanting

45:03.568 --> 45:05.935
- to lose weight so that you can get out of bed, right?
- Yeah.

45:05.937 --> 45:09.906
Okay. So what do you think is contributing
to continuing to gain weight or...

45:09.908 --> 45:10.973
[Lisa] I don't know.

45:11.975 --> 45:13.409
[sighing]

45:19.049 --> 45:21.918
Lisa, if you want to make change
I'm gonna need you to engage with me.

45:21.920 --> 45:23.419
But I don't know!

45:25.589 --> 45:27.090
So, you've not struggled with--

45:27.658 --> 45:30.593
What is this gonna do me any good,
with you just coming in here and talk...

45:30.595 --> 45:33.029
This is not even what
a nutritionist done.

45:33.031 --> 45:35.598
I've seen nutritionists
before, this is [bleep].

45:35.600 --> 45:39.402
Lisa, this is my specialty
of working with people

45:39.404 --> 45:41.871
who struggle in their
relationship with food.

45:41.873 --> 45:44.207
This is what I do every day.

45:44.209 --> 45:46.142
You're wasting my time.

45:46.777 --> 45:47.944
[groans]

45:47.946 --> 45:49.645
What would you rather be doing?

45:49.647 --> 45:52.882
I don't know!
Leave me alone, lady!

45:52.884 --> 45:55.752
Sometimes when we get
angry and frustrated

45:55.754 --> 45:57.954
we wanna blame other people
and have them take--

45:57.956 --> 45:59.856
Okay, this is over with.

45:59.858 --> 46:02.225
Get out. I'm done,
I'm done talking to you.

46:02.526 --> 46:03.793
Give me my book.

46:03.795 --> 46:06.362
I don't blame nobody for
anything that's happened to me.

46:06.830 --> 46:09.899
Lisa, is part of you
afraid of getting help?

46:09.901 --> 46:12.201
- [bleep]! Just get the [bleep] away from me!
- Okay.

46:15.038 --> 46:16.339
[Lisa yelling] Get
the [bleep] out!

46:16.907 --> 46:17.807
[bleep]

46:19.209 --> 46:23.012
Do not ever come back
to my house again!

46:24.848 --> 46:27.517
<i>[Emily] In Lisa's responses she definitely
demonstrated a lot of resistance.</i>

46:27.519 --> 46:30.186
And she's obviously angry.

46:30.188 --> 46:34.891
But a big part of her journey is going to
be being able to be honest and vulnerable.

46:34.893 --> 46:38.561
<i>And so Lisa's unwillingness
and hesitancy to engage</i>

46:38.563 --> 46:40.263
definitely raises a lot
of questions for me

46:40.265 --> 46:45.101
<i>about whether or not she's really
committed to the journey of healing.</i>

46:50.874 --> 46:55.711
[Lisa] And then, I also told them I
cannot do physical therapy after 3:30.

46:55.713 --> 46:59.048
So how... I mean, what
are we gonna do about that?

46:59.050 --> 47:01.384
He set that up
at 6:30 at night.

47:01.386 --> 47:04.854
Dr. Now, he knew [bleep] good and
well I cannot do anything after that,

47:04.856 --> 47:07.256
so that's disrespect
on his part.

47:07.258 --> 47:09.725
And I'm supposed to respect
this man? No.

47:09.727 --> 47:13.162
It's all disrespect towards me,
but it's okay to disrespect me

47:13.164 --> 47:15.331
[yelling] 'cause I'm
as fat as [bleep]!

47:15.333 --> 47:17.266
Where is my respect?

47:35.919 --> 47:36.819
[knocking at door]

47:36.821 --> 47:38.387
Bring your [bleep] in!

47:43.093 --> 47:45.428
- Hey, there. Lisa?
- Yeah.

47:45.929 --> 47:48.297
Hi, Lisa. My name is Staci.

47:49.066 --> 47:52.134
And I am a physical therapist.

48:06.917 --> 48:08.017
[Staci] So...

48:09.620 --> 48:11.420
How about we...

48:11.422 --> 48:13.422
Can we do a little
chatting first just to...

48:14.157 --> 48:15.825
- You have five minutes.
- Okay.

48:15.827 --> 48:17.627
So how about this?

48:17.629 --> 48:22.598
What goals do you have as far as
physically, with physical therapy?

48:22.600 --> 48:23.900
What can physical therapy
help you with?

48:23.902 --> 48:25.701
There's nothing you
can do for me.

48:25.703 --> 48:27.703
Have you had physical
therapy in the past?

48:27.705 --> 48:29.939
Are you interested
in any type of exercises

48:29.941 --> 48:33.109
- that you can do in bed?
- No. No. No.

48:34.011 --> 48:34.710
I'd like to help you.

48:34.712 --> 48:36.979
Yeah. Whatever.

48:36.981 --> 48:40.416
You were not supposed to be
this late. How is that fair?

48:40.418 --> 48:42.084
You were not supposed
to come this late!

48:42.086 --> 48:46.055
I really don't have anything to
say to you or anything I want to do.

48:46.390 --> 48:48.157
You wasted your time.

48:49.660 --> 48:51.027
Okay.

48:53.830 --> 48:56.699
Thank you for coming.
I appreciate it.

48:56.701 --> 48:59.869
I have some resistance bands
out in my vehicle,

48:59.871 --> 49:02.271
if it's something that
you'd like...

49:02.273 --> 49:03.739
I can bring in here and show you

49:03.741 --> 49:06.042
- a couple of things that you can do with them.
- [Lisa] I'm not...

49:06.044 --> 49:06.842
I'm not having you
show me anything.

49:06.844 --> 49:08.611
If you got some papers
I'll take 'em,

49:08.613 --> 49:11.347
- and I'll figure it out later on.
- [softly] Okay.

49:11.349 --> 49:14.750
I don't have any papers
with me, but my plan was

49:14.752 --> 49:19.288
just to see what we can do today,
and then I can get you papers.

49:22.426 --> 49:26.362
- Nothing that I can do here with you? For you?
- No.

49:27.030 --> 49:28.197
Okay.

49:28.199 --> 49:30.599
You wouldn't consider anything?

49:30.601 --> 49:32.768
Absolutely not.

49:32.770 --> 49:37.974
Well, I would love to help
you in whatever way I could.

49:37.976 --> 49:39.775
- Okay?
- Yeah.

49:39.777 --> 49:41.243
I really truly would.

49:42.145 --> 49:45.314
So, you would like me just to...

49:45.549 --> 49:47.483
Go out? Is that...

49:47.485 --> 49:51.887
- Yeah. There's really nothing we can do.
- Okay.

49:51.889 --> 49:55.458
Is there any type of activity that
you are able to do in the bed?

49:55.460 --> 49:57.727
Moving your legs,
moving your arms,

49:57.729 --> 50:00.129
rolling side-to-side,
are there things like that

50:00.131 --> 50:03.366
that you do just for
activity, for movement?

50:03.368 --> 50:05.101
- No.
- Okay.

50:05.103 --> 50:07.570
How about sitting edge of
bed, are you able to do that?

50:07.572 --> 50:09.839
- No.
- Okay.

50:09.841 --> 50:14.710
Um, even just raising your arms
up overhead and coming back down?

50:14.712 --> 50:17.246
Oh, my God. Never mind.
Thank you for coming.

50:17.248 --> 50:19.749
-That's the end of it. Bye-bye.
-Okay.

50:19.751 --> 50:21.117
Thank you.

50:32.062 --> 50:34.997
This is why my family don't
[bleep] with white people no more.

50:50.781 --> 50:51.947
Did you call 'em?

50:51.949 --> 50:54.016
What'd she say?

51:15.806 --> 51:18.074
You know, this burger
don't taste good.

51:22.312 --> 51:26.048
[Randy speaking]

51:26.050 --> 51:29.385
Dr. Now is a liar 'cause he claims
he sent me a diet and he never did.

51:30.754 --> 51:32.321
He makes the devil look good.

51:37.027 --> 51:40.029
[video call chiming]

51:40.764 --> 51:43.165
<i>- Hi, Lisa.
- Hi.</i>

51:43.767 --> 51:46.202
<i>- How are you?
- I'm all right.</i>

51:46.204 --> 51:48.804
<i>- So what's going on with you?
- Nothing.</i>

51:48.806 --> 51:51.340
<i>[Dr. Now] That seems
to be what you do best.</i>

51:51.342 --> 51:53.776
<i>Because you're clearly
not doing the diet.</i>

51:53.778 --> 51:57.580
<i>And you still haven't cooperated
with PT. So why is that?</i>

51:57.582 --> 51:59.882
[Lisa] I still don't
understand no diet.

51:59.884 --> 52:03.052
I don't understand your book, it
didn't have no diet in, that I'd seen.

52:07.791 --> 52:09.024
No.

52:09.826 --> 52:11.393
I guess it is. I don't know.

52:15.198 --> 52:17.266
I don't know.

52:17.268 --> 52:19.301
- [Randy] You have been eating less.
<i>- [Dr. Now] Okay. And--</i>

52:19.303 --> 52:22.905
You can't tell him anything so
don't bother wasting your time.

52:22.907 --> 52:26.075
<i>- [Dr. Now] And what?
- Nothing, I'm not talking to you.</i>

52:30.881 --> 52:32.414
- I don't know.
- [Randy] Yes, you have.

52:45.829 --> 52:46.428
Oh, well.

52:47.998 --> 52:49.131
Yeah.

52:55.872 --> 52:57.907
The one lady who did come,
she says I'm too [bleep] fat,

52:57.909 --> 53:00.276
and she don't know
how to work with me.

53:00.278 --> 53:01.677
<i>[Dr. Now] That's not
what happened.</i>

53:01.679 --> 53:05.147
<i>You refused to work with her
every time she came.</i>

53:05.149 --> 53:08.250
<i>And now you're lying
to manipulate the situation.</i>

53:15.525 --> 53:16.625
Yeah.

53:16.826 --> 53:20.162
<i>So this is something you
that you need to do</i>

53:23.967 --> 53:26.068
I don't really care anymore.

53:47.190 --> 53:49.291
What the [bleep] you gave me?

53:50.126 --> 53:51.293
I'm done, goodbye.

53:52.162 --> 53:53.229
Here, I'm done.

53:56.099 --> 53:57.233
I'm done.

54:01.705 --> 54:03.272
Worthless Dr. Now.

54:12.282 --> 54:18.087
I don't think Lisa ever really intended
to make any of the changes she needed.

54:18.089 --> 54:22.424
<i>I think she thought she can manipulate
her way into weight loss surgery</i>

54:22.426 --> 54:26.528
and she wouldn't have to do any
work to lose the weight and save her life.

54:26.530 --> 54:30.566
<i>So, right now, as long as
that is her perspective</i>

54:30.568 --> 54:36.505
and she intends to lie to me and give
me excuses intended to manipulate me,

54:36.507 --> 54:38.607
<i>there is nothing
we can do for her.</i>

54:38.609 --> 54:42.411
<i>So, from here, one of two
things is gonna happen,</i>

54:42.413 --> 54:46.782
either Lisa wake up to
the reality of her situation

54:46.784 --> 54:49.918
<i>and get what she needs to
change before it's too late,</i>

54:49.920 --> 54:53.355
<i>or she's not going
to be alive much longer.</i>

55:23.019 --> 55:26.955
<i>[Lisa] My boyfriend, he got
real sick and, um...</i>

55:26.957 --> 55:30.359
<i>they actually had to come and take
him out 'cause he was unconscious.</i>

55:31.428 --> 55:33.028
So, um...

55:33.763 --> 55:36.498
after that, they're, like, you
know, they think he has Covid,

55:36.500 --> 55:38.500
you really gotta go get tested.

55:38.502 --> 55:42.404
So, I called an ambulance
and they came and got me and

55:42.406 --> 55:44.473
took me to the hospital and
they say, "Yeah, you got Covid"

55:44.475 --> 55:47.042
and this is where
I winded up at.

55:57.554 --> 56:02.758
<i>Well, he fell off the bed,
actually he rolled off the bed,</i>

56:02.760 --> 56:06.895
So, I said "That's it, Randy" I said, "I'm
calling an ambulance" and I called one

56:06.897 --> 56:10.999
and it took him away and I,
I never got to see him again.

56:13.737 --> 56:15.304
<i>He texted me once</i>

56:16.873 --> 56:18.774
<i>and that's the last
time I heard from him.</i>

56:18.776 --> 56:21.543
<i>He says "I love you and
miss you, are you okay?"</i>

56:21.545 --> 56:24.413
<i>I told him that I loved
him and miss him too</i>

56:24.415 --> 56:29.151
and that he has to fight so he can
come back home and be with us.

56:29.153 --> 56:32.855
<i>I just miss his hugs and
his kisses and everything,</i>

56:32.857 --> 56:35.424
<i>watching him cook and he,
he'd be here right now</i>

56:35.426 --> 56:38.026
<i>sitting in that chair
over there, you know?</i>

56:38.828 --> 56:41.163
<i>I just miss everything
about him.</i>

56:41.165 --> 56:42.831
<i>He was a good man.</i>

56:42.833 --> 56:46.635
<i>I think it's going to be very hard to
go home 'cause Randy's not there.</i>

56:46.637 --> 56:51.940
<i>Gotta go home to that empty house
where I'm used to him being there and</i>

56:51.942 --> 56:56.245
<i>all of his stuff's there and
he's just not gonna be there.</i>

57:18.802 --> 57:20.369
[video call chiming]

57:22.205 --> 57:23.105
<i>[Dr. Now] Hi, Lisa.</i>

57:23.107 --> 57:24.306
Hello there.

57:24.941 --> 57:25.941
<i>How're you doing?</i>

57:25.943 --> 57:27.776
I'm doing better.

57:27.778 --> 57:29.011
<i>Glad to hear that.</i>

57:31.014 --> 57:33.215
I'm in the hospital still.

57:33.917 --> 57:35.984
<i>So, why are you in hospital?</i>

57:35.986 --> 57:37.252
I had Covid.

57:37.254 --> 57:40.088
<i>So, you had the Covid
and you've recovered?</i>

57:40.090 --> 57:41.456
Yeah.

57:41.458 --> 57:44.893
<i>Well, you're very lucky at
your weight to survive that.</i>

57:44.895 --> 57:46.428
<i>How long have you
been in hospital?</i>

57:46.963 --> 57:49.031
I think for about a month.

57:50.733 --> 57:54.269
Well, my boyfriend,
Randy, passed away

57:54.271 --> 57:59.341
from Covid so he's not gonna be
there to help me anymore, but, um,

57:59.343 --> 58:04.646
I have two friends, so, they're
gonna be there to help me out a lot.

58:04.648 --> 58:08.917
<i>I'm very sorry to hear about
Randy, I'm sorry for your loss.</i>

58:08.919 --> 58:12.321
<i>So, uh, how is your weight now?</i>

58:12.856 --> 58:15.157
It's at 554.

58:15.159 --> 58:16.925
<i>So, you've lost
some weight, huh?</i>

58:16.927 --> 58:18.026
Yeah.

58:18.028 --> 58:21.029
<i>All right, are you doing
any physical therapy?</i>

58:21.031 --> 58:24.967
Yes, I have to do
exercise three times a day.

58:24.969 --> 58:27.069
<i>Good. How is your mobility?
Can you get out of bed?</i>

58:27.071 --> 58:28.937
No, not yet.

58:33.243 --> 58:37.312
Tanishia and Destiny, which are the two
young ladies gonna help me, said that they'll

58:37.981 --> 58:40.349
help me with my exercises and

58:41.184 --> 58:42.584
stuff that I need at home.

58:47.590 --> 58:51.760
[sighs] That's another issue that I
wanted to discuss with you because

58:51.762 --> 58:54.563
my sister actually
cleaned my house out

58:54.565 --> 58:58.500
because we thought I was going
to go to a long term facility.

58:58.502 --> 59:03.438
So your diet and books
got put into a box,

59:03.440 --> 59:07.576
which is in my garage and
we have no idea where it's at.

59:07.578 --> 59:09.811
So I was wondering if you
could send it all to me again

59:09.813 --> 59:11.680
and they said that
they'll help me.

59:11.682 --> 59:15.884
'Cause, you know, they're the ones gonna
be preparing my meals and cooking for me.

59:15.886 --> 59:19.221
And they said they'll help me
to stay on this diet plan if

59:19.856 --> 59:21.390
we can get it all again.

59:22.825 --> 59:24.059
And I believe they will.

59:29.899 --> 59:30.799
Yeah.

59:30.801 --> 59:32.234
<i>That's gonna be the key issue.</i>

59:32.236 --> 59:34.403
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
I can do it,

59:34.405 --> 59:38.874
I got to the point with the
hospital where I just eat till I'm full.

59:38.876 --> 59:44.479
<i>Well, so far you started with 637. From
the weight that you originally gave me,</i>

59:44.481 --> 59:50.886
<i>now you are at 554, you know
that is an 83-lb weight loss.</i>

59:50.888 --> 59:53.755
<i>And that's a great improvement,
so what we got right now,</i>

59:53.757 --> 59:55.624
<i>you don't wanna go home
and gain all that weight back.</i>

59:55.626 --> 59:57.759
No, I don't. I really don't.

59:57.761 --> 1:00:02.030
<i>And, hopefully, as soon as
you can stand up and be</i>

1:00:02.032 --> 1:00:04.700
<i>able to take some
steps on your own.</i>

1:00:04.702 --> 1:00:07.235
Yeah, I would love to do that.

1:00:08.471 --> 1:00:10.572
<i>All right, I will send
you everything again</i>

1:00:10.574 --> 1:00:13.542
<i>and get PT set up and get
you back on the program.</i>

1:00:13.544 --> 1:00:19.848
<i>And since you recently had a big loss, I'm
also gonna set up some psychotherapy for you</i>

1:00:19.850 --> 1:00:22.150
<i>to talk to them and see
if they can help you.</i>

1:00:22.152 --> 1:00:23.051
Okay.

1:00:23.053 --> 1:00:24.286
But after this,

1:00:35.131 --> 1:00:37.132
Oh yeah, that'd be so nice.

1:00:37.233 --> 1:00:39.134
Okay.

1:00:39.136 --> 1:00:42.838
Please, please don't forget to
send me that book and stuff though.

1:00:42.840 --> 1:00:43.372
<i>We won't.</i>

1:00:49.879 --> 1:00:50.912
Okay.

1:00:50.980 --> 1:00:53.815
I'll do the best I can.

1:00:53.817 --> 1:00:56.685
<i>Well, you have no
choice at this point.</i>

1:00:56.687 --> 1:00:58.520
[chuckles] No, I really don't.

1:00:58.522 --> 1:01:02.357
<i>Don't go home and turn your
new roommate into an enabler.</i>

1:01:02.359 --> 1:01:06.528
No, they're gonna, uh,
cook and stuff for me and

1:01:06.530 --> 1:01:11.867
they're gonna help me learn how to prepare
meals like you wanted to and stuff like that.

1:01:11.869 --> 1:01:14.703
<i>All right, have you
worked with them before?</i>

1:01:14.705 --> 1:01:18.306
Um, they're just real
good friends of mine.

1:01:19.542 --> 1:01:23.945
<i>Okay, I'm gonna have to see
how that will work out.</i>

1:01:23.947 --> 1:01:27.549
<i>And once you do that, we can
work on you coming down to Houston.</i>

1:01:27.551 --> 1:01:28.817
Okay.

1:01:28.819 --> 1:01:31.887
<i>So these are all
the goals that you got</i>

1:01:31.889 --> 1:01:34.690
<i>and you have to work
on 'em and get 'em all done.</i>

1:01:34.692 --> 1:01:38.026
Okay, I'll do my best.

1:01:38.028 --> 1:01:43.131
<i>Well, don't depend on other
people to give you the right stuff,</i>

1:01:43.133 --> 1:01:44.533
<i>to do everything for you.</i>

1:01:44.535 --> 1:01:45.567
Okay.

1:01:45.868 --> 1:01:47.436
<i>You have to make those
right choices yourself.</i>

1:01:47.438 --> 1:01:50.005
Okay, I can do that.

1:01:50.007 --> 1:01:55.043
<i>And uh, you know, and try to eat
the smallest amount that you can</i>

1:01:55.045 --> 1:01:56.378
<i>and don't overeat, okay?</i>

1:01:56.380 --> 1:01:57.846
Okay.

1:01:57.848 --> 1:02:02.084
<i>And that will be one of the most
important thing that you need.</i>

1:02:02.086 --> 1:02:03.785
Okay.

1:02:03.787 --> 1:02:06.321
<i>All right, I'm glad you lost some
weight and that you got through Covid.</i>

1:02:07.023 --> 1:02:08.390
<i>I'm sorry about your boyfriend.</i>

1:02:08.392 --> 1:02:10.058
Well, thank you.

1:02:10.426 --> 1:02:15.130
<i>But, I think at this point, getting
therapy has to be your highest priority.</i>

1:02:15.132 --> 1:02:18.600
<i>But whether or not that
happens is all up to you, okay?</i>

1:02:18.602 --> 1:02:19.801
All right.

1:02:19.869 --> 1:02:22.104
<i>If you need anything when
you go home, give me a call.</i>

1:02:22.106 --> 1:02:24.706
All right.
Well, I appreciate it.

1:02:24.708 --> 1:02:27.743
<i>All right. All right, nice to see
you again, Lisa. Take care.</i>

1:02:27.745 --> 1:02:29.177
You too, thank you.

1:02:29.345 --> 1:02:31.113
<i>- All right. Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.</i>

1:02:43.893 --> 1:02:49.464
It seems like Lisa had a bit of a
wake-up call with her recent illness

1:02:49.466 --> 1:02:51.733
<i>and now she wants to
do the program again.</i>

1:02:51.735 --> 1:02:54.803
<i>It's sad that it had
to come to that for her</i>

1:02:54.805 --> 1:02:57.506
to start to see the reality
of her situation.

1:02:57.508 --> 1:03:02.677
<i>But, thankfully for her sake, she seems to
have gotten good care in a local hospital</i>

1:03:02.679 --> 1:03:05.313
<i>that not only help her
to pull through everything,</i>

1:03:05.315 --> 1:03:10.685
but they have also managed to
get her weight down just over 80-lbs,

1:03:10.687 --> 1:03:14.589
<i>which is a very good start for her,
but we are soon gonna be limited</i>

1:03:14.591 --> 1:03:15.957
in what we can do for her

1:03:15.959 --> 1:03:20.061
<i>until she does what she needs
to get out of the bed.</i>

1:03:20.063 --> 1:03:22.998
<i>Since she recently
had a significant loss,</i>

1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:25.934
<i>I want psychotherapy
to talk with her,</i>

1:03:25.936 --> 1:03:28.703
<i>make sure she has an outlet now</i>

1:03:28.705 --> 1:03:29.638
<i>for how she's feeling.</i>

1:03:29.640 --> 1:03:31.573
So, she doesn't use that

1:03:31.575 --> 1:03:34.810
as an excuse to start eating
whatever she wants again.

1:03:34.812 --> 1:03:38.613
<i>Because Lisa can't afford
to miss this chance now.</i>

1:03:38.615 --> 1:03:42.484
She's very lucky to make
it this far in her condition.

1:03:42.486 --> 1:03:45.654
<i>And if she goes home
and goes back to old habits</i>

1:03:45.656 --> 1:03:47.989
<i>and doesn't do what
she needs to change,</i>

1:03:47.991 --> 1:03:50.692
<i>then things are not
gonna end well for her.</i>

1:03:50.694 --> 1:03:52.828
<i>So this is her last chance.</i>

1:03:52.830 --> 1:03:55.096
<i>She either does
what she needs this time</i>

1:03:55.098 --> 1:03:57.966
or we're done playing games
with her.

1:03:58.134 --> 1:04:00.068
[groaning]

1:04:03.773 --> 1:04:05.106
Thank you, guys.

1:04:05.108 --> 1:04:06.308
[man] You bet.

1:04:15.918 --> 1:04:17.719
No threes.

1:04:17.721 --> 1:04:19.487
Are you ready
for your exercises?

1:04:19.489 --> 1:04:21.389
- Yeah, just in a minute.
- Okay.

1:04:23.025 --> 1:04:25.327
I found the diet you're
supposed to be on last night.

1:04:25.628 --> 1:04:26.661
Did you?

1:04:26.663 --> 1:04:28.797
Mmm, go ahead
and do your exercises first

1:04:28.799 --> 1:04:29.631
so that I can
get your supper going.

1:04:29.633 --> 1:04:32.067
Yeah, I will do it later.

1:04:32.069 --> 1:04:35.003
- Can we throw these away first, please?
- Yeah.

1:04:36.172 --> 1:04:37.272
Okay.

1:04:37.740 --> 1:04:38.740
Are you ready?

1:04:38.742 --> 1:04:41.176
You want the orange band today
or the green one?

1:04:41.878 --> 1:04:43.778
Let's try the orange one today.

1:04:43.780 --> 1:04:47.382
Which one do you want?
'Cause the green's harder.

1:04:47.384 --> 1:04:49.184
Well, we'll work our way
up to green.

1:04:49.385 --> 1:04:50.485
All right.

1:04:51.387 --> 1:04:54.022
We gotta do outwards first.

1:04:54.824 --> 1:04:56.258
One.

1:04:57.026 --> 1:04:58.326
- Two.
- Two.

1:04:58.928 --> 1:05:00.295
- Three.
- Three.

1:05:00.930 --> 1:05:01.997
- Four.
- Four.

1:05:01.999 --> 1:05:03.331
- Five.
- Five.

1:05:03.866 --> 1:05:05.133
- Six.
- Six.

1:05:05.401 --> 1:05:07.035
- Seven.
- Seven.

1:05:07.403 --> 1:05:08.336
- Eight.
- Eight.

1:05:09.005 --> 1:05:10.372
- Nine.
- Nine.

1:05:10.740 --> 1:05:11.840
- Ten.
- Ten.

1:05:11.842 --> 1:05:13.341
This arm...
this arm is weak.

1:05:14.644 --> 1:05:15.911
You got this.

1:05:15.913 --> 1:05:18.113
Okay, now we have
to do the leg ones.

1:05:18.180 --> 1:05:19.281
Okay.

1:05:20.049 --> 1:05:21.783
- Two.
- Two.

1:05:21.785 --> 1:05:22.951
- Three.
- Three.

1:05:23.085 --> 1:05:24.252
- Four.
- Four.

1:05:24.921 --> 1:05:25.987
- Five.
- Five.

1:05:25.989 --> 1:05:27.722
- Six.
- Six.

1:05:27.724 --> 1:05:28.423
- Seven.
- Seven.

1:05:28.991 --> 1:05:30.125
- Eight.
- Eight.

1:05:30.393 --> 1:05:31.826
- Nine.
- Nine.

1:05:31.828 --> 1:05:32.994
- Ten.
- Ten.

1:05:32.996 --> 1:05:34.129
- Okay.
- Good job.

1:05:34.196 --> 1:05:35.096
[sighs wearily]

1:05:35.098 --> 1:05:36.965
Now I'm worn out.

1:05:37.099 --> 1:05:38.800
Let me check my oxygen

1:05:38.802 --> 1:05:40.368
since I got no oxygen on.

1:05:41.037 --> 1:05:42.170
[Desi] Okay.

1:05:42.672 --> 1:05:45.040
So, in the book,

1:05:45.574 --> 1:05:47.375
it tells you what you can drink,

1:05:47.377 --> 1:05:50.712
zero calorie drinks
that you can have.

1:05:50.714 --> 1:05:52.981
And then it goes on
to give you recipes like,

1:05:52.983 --> 1:05:55.183
cucumber yogurt salad,

1:05:55.185 --> 1:05:56.918
uh, sliced carrots,

1:05:56.920 --> 1:05:58.653
and sliced yellow squash.

1:05:58.655 --> 1:06:00.088
Do you wanna do that?

1:06:00.090 --> 1:06:02.123
We'll figure out something.

1:06:02.858 --> 1:06:04.125
[sighs]

1:06:08.497 --> 1:06:09.831
As we put stuff on

1:06:09.833 --> 1:06:11.967
we'll have to check and see
how many calories

1:06:11.969 --> 1:06:13.301
- that makes me have.
- Yeah.

1:06:14.804 --> 1:06:17.205
Desi, here's a part
in this book that talks about

1:06:17.207 --> 1:06:20.075
how much proteins
and everything too.

1:06:20.077 --> 1:06:21.042
Okay.

1:06:22.745 --> 1:06:24.746
These are some pretty
big chicken breasts.

1:06:24.748 --> 1:06:26.414
[Lisa]
Yeah, what it's what I said,

1:06:26.416 --> 1:06:28.249
that's why I said I don't
think we'll need 'em all.

1:06:28.251 --> 1:06:29.384
[Desi] No.

1:06:29.386 --> 1:06:32.053
- [Lisa] I'm only supposed to eat three ounces.
- Maybe--

1:06:32.055 --> 1:06:35.991
So probably not even a half of
one's gonna be three ounces.

1:06:35.993 --> 1:06:40.328
It takes 68 hours
to digest food completely.

1:06:41.897 --> 1:06:43.198
[Desi] Chicken's in.

1:06:43.699 --> 1:06:45.400
So, that'll be a little bit.

1:06:46.535 --> 1:06:50.105
Oh, I didn't know our intestines
were 20 to 30 feet long.

1:06:51.240 --> 1:06:52.974
I didn't know that either,
that's interesting.

1:06:52.976 --> 1:06:54.409
[Lisa] Yeah.

1:06:54.411 --> 1:06:57.178
I'm learning some things
from it.

1:06:57.413 --> 1:06:58.947
Lord.

1:07:06.989 --> 1:07:07.989
I'm tired today.

1:07:07.991 --> 1:07:10.058
I am too.

1:07:10.060 --> 1:07:12.660
I ain't go to bed until
like 4:30 a.m.

1:07:12.662 --> 1:07:13.728
I'm exhausted.

1:07:13.730 --> 1:07:16.064
Do you want me to get
you set up for this?

1:07:16.066 --> 1:07:18.967
[laughing] Uh,
I'd appreciate it.

1:07:25.775 --> 1:07:27.976
Can you see it from here?

1:07:27.978 --> 1:07:30.512
Yeah, I'm just worried that
not being able to hear him.

1:07:30.514 --> 1:07:32.881
- I'll turn it up for you.
- Okay.

1:07:32.883 --> 1:07:35.650
I'll go ahead and step out,
give you some privacy.

1:07:35.652 --> 1:07:37.018
[video call chiming]

1:07:43.092 --> 1:07:45.193
<i>- Hi, there.
- Hello.</i>

1:07:45.195 --> 1:07:46.795
<i>I'm Doctor Paradise.</i>

1:07:46.797 --> 1:07:47.996
[Lisa] I'm Lisa.

1:07:47.998 --> 1:07:50.432
<i>Hi, Lisa. Good to see you.</i>

1:07:50.434 --> 1:07:52.634
<i>- Um, how you doing?
- I'm okay.</i>

1:07:52.636 --> 1:07:55.870
<i>Okay. I see you,
you laying back in bed there.</i>

1:07:55.872 --> 1:07:58.873
<i>Uh, when's the last time
you got out of that bed?</i>

1:07:58.875 --> 1:08:00.308
About four years ago.

1:08:01.977 --> 1:08:02.744
<i>Holy cow.</i>

1:08:02.811 --> 1:08:03.945
<i>Um...</i>

1:08:03.947 --> 1:08:06.714
<i>All right. Tell me
a little bit about yourself.</i>

1:08:06.716 --> 1:08:07.916
<i>When did you first get big?</i>

1:08:07.918 --> 1:08:08.950
I really don't know.

1:08:08.952 --> 1:08:10.718
-I never paid any attention
<i>- Okay.</i>

1:08:10.720 --> 1:08:11.886
To my weight
or anything like that.

1:08:11.888 --> 1:08:13.955
It never bothered me,
so I never really cared.

1:08:13.957 --> 1:08:16.724
<i>But I wanna find out
how you got that big.</i>

1:08:16.726 --> 1:08:23.031
<i>Because nobody gets
to be 600 pounds by accident.</i>

1:08:23.033 --> 1:08:25.700
<i>- You know, it is usually
somebody feeding them -Yeah.</i>

1:08:25.702 --> 1:08:28.069
<i>Or some emotional
eating going on.</i>

1:08:28.071 --> 1:08:30.939
<i>How did you get
to be 600 pounds?</i>

1:08:30.941 --> 1:08:31.840
Well, I don't know,

1:08:31.842 --> 1:08:34.943
my boyfriend used
to bring me food,

1:08:34.945 --> 1:08:35.877
so, I don't know.

1:08:35.879 --> 1:08:37.178
<i>Okay.</i>

1:08:37.180 --> 1:08:39.080
<i>Which boyfriend was this?</i>

1:08:39.415 --> 1:08:40.215
Randy.

1:08:40.217 --> 1:08:42.083
<i>When was Randy around?</i>

1:08:42.151 --> 1:08:44.018
Last 10 years.

1:08:44.020 --> 1:08:45.120
<i>Is he still around?</i>

1:08:45.122 --> 1:08:47.021
No, he's died.

1:08:48.090 --> 1:08:49.457
<i>Oh, wow.</i>

1:08:49.459 --> 1:08:51.059
Tell me about that.

1:08:54.029 --> 1:08:56.397
[high-pitched] Just nothing
to say, he just died.

1:08:58.033 --> 1:08:59.134
<i>Uh, what did he die from?</i>

1:08:59.136 --> 1:09:00.468
Covid.

1:09:00.470 --> 1:09:01.903
<i>[Paradise] Oh, no.</i>

1:09:01.905 --> 1:09:05.573
- He got sick.
<i>- I'm so sorry that you had that loss.</i>

1:09:05.575 --> 1:09:07.909
<i>How long ago was that?</i>

1:09:07.911 --> 1:09:10.078
It will be two months
on the 18th.

1:09:10.479 --> 1:09:11.612
<i>[Dr. Paradise] Okay.</i>

1:09:11.614 --> 1:09:14.682
<i>Uh, Randy was fine
with you being in the bed?</i>

1:09:14.684 --> 1:09:18.653
No, he didn't like it
but we didn't know what to do.

1:09:18.655 --> 1:09:21.656
<i>What do you remember about him?</i>

1:09:21.658 --> 1:09:23.791
Randy was one of those
people who would

1:09:23.793 --> 1:09:26.094
do anything
and everything for you.

1:09:26.096 --> 1:09:28.997
<i>He was pretty committed to
seeing you get out of that bed, I bet.</i>

1:09:28.999 --> 1:09:29.998
Yeah.

1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:32.033
<i>I want you to hang on to that,</i>

1:09:32.035 --> 1:09:33.935
<i>'cause I think that, uh,</i>

1:09:33.937 --> 1:09:36.905
<i>probably the best way
you can remember Randy</i>

1:09:36.907 --> 1:09:38.973
<i>is by losing weight.</i>

1:09:40.409 --> 1:09:42.010
<i>What are the tears about?</i>

1:09:42.012 --> 1:09:44.112
[high-pitched] I just want
to get off this bed.

1:09:44.114 --> 1:09:46.147
[sobbing] I want my life back.

1:09:46.882 --> 1:09:49.050
I wanna be able to go...

1:09:49.052 --> 1:09:52.820
do things with my
grand children and you know?

1:09:52.822 --> 1:09:56.758
<i>[Dr. Paradise] Lisa, it's meaningful
that you're getting emotional about this.</i>

1:09:56.760 --> 1:09:59.160
<i>'Cause it means you really care.</i>

1:10:00.429 --> 1:10:03.831
<i>And I wanna see the behavior
that matches that care.</i>

1:10:03.833 --> 1:10:08.069
I need to figure out a way to feel
like I'm really worth it though, because

1:10:08.771 --> 1:10:11.973
I don't feel like
I'm worth much of anything.

1:10:13.175 --> 1:10:15.810
<i>Well, laying in a bed
will do that to you, right?</i>

1:10:15.812 --> 1:10:16.811
Yeah.

1:10:19.682 --> 1:10:23.117
<i>Yeah, one of the best ways
to build your</i>

1:10:23.119 --> 1:10:25.887
<i>self-worth is to do stuff
that makes you feel worthy.</i>

1:10:25.921 --> 1:10:27.021
Okay.

1:10:27.023 --> 1:10:30.725
<i>Lisa, it sounds like
you got it right in your head.</i>

1:10:30.727 --> 1:10:32.594
<i>You've got
the internal motivation,</i>

1:10:32.596 --> 1:10:34.295
<i>you really wanna do this</i>

1:10:34.297 --> 1:10:36.931
<i>and we just have to sort
of connect the dots for you.</i>

1:10:36.933 --> 1:10:38.333
Yeah.

1:10:38.335 --> 1:10:41.102
<i>Do you see
any roadblocks for you?</i>

1:10:41.104 --> 1:10:43.338
<i>What are the things that
are keeping you in the bed?</i>

1:10:45.975 --> 1:10:47.742
Just myself.

1:10:47.744 --> 1:10:50.812
<i>Part of the challenge for you
getting out of that bed</i>

1:10:50.814 --> 1:10:52.647
<i>is in your head.</i>

1:10:52.649 --> 1:10:55.650
<i>I understand there's
real physical limitations</i>

1:10:55.652 --> 1:10:59.020
<i>but I wonder if you're also
little afraid of getting out of bed.</i>

1:10:59.022 --> 1:11:01.122
Oh, I'm terrified of that,
ain't gonna lie.

1:11:01.523 --> 1:11:02.757
<i>[Dr. Paradise] Yeah.</i>

1:11:02.759 --> 1:11:06.861
<i>And the way
we usually work on fear</i>

1:11:06.863 --> 1:11:09.130
<i>- is we break it into little parts.
- Okay.</i>

1:11:09.132 --> 1:11:12.567
<i>Like what about hanging your
legs over to the side of the bed?</i>

1:11:12.569 --> 1:11:13.835
<i>How does that sound?</i>

1:11:13.837 --> 1:11:16.571
I... yeah, I'll have to figure
out a way to do that.

1:11:16.573 --> 1:11:20.108
<i>And I know
it's gonna be hard, but, uh,</i>

1:11:20.110 --> 1:11:24.946
<i>hard things are usually in front
of good things that we want.</i>

1:11:24.948 --> 1:11:25.847
- Yeah.
<i>- Okay?</i>

1:11:25.849 --> 1:11:27.615
<i>So, maybe</i>

1:11:27.617 --> 1:11:30.718
<i>sort of incrementally
working up to sitting up,</i>

1:11:30.720 --> 1:11:33.221
<i>hanging your legs
over the side of the bed</i>

1:11:33.223 --> 1:11:35.657
<i>just getting use to the feel
of not laying down.</i>

1:11:35.659 --> 1:11:37.158
Okay.

1:11:37.493 --> 1:11:40.595
<i>[Dr. Paradise] And eventually
maybe resting your feet on the floor,</i>

1:11:40.597 --> 1:11:43.931
so that you don't-- the fear
isn't what's keeping from doing it.

1:11:43.933 --> 1:11:47.835
No, I got a question
for you though.

1:11:47.837 --> 1:11:48.836
<i>- Sure.
- Is there something</i>

1:11:48.838 --> 1:11:51.172
to do that will help me
with getting over Randy?

1:11:51.907 --> 1:11:53.241
<i>Well, you know,</i>

1:11:53.575 --> 1:11:57.045
<i>- grief is hard, and, uh,
-Yeah.</i>

1:11:57.047 --> 1:12:00.348
<i>I sometimes say if they could
put time in a pill</i>

1:12:00.350 --> 1:12:01.949
<i>they'd sell out of it.</i>

1:12:01.951 --> 1:12:06.387
<i>So time is going to be helpful
to you, through the grief.</i>

1:12:06.389 --> 1:12:08.690
<i>[stuttering] And,
Lisa, you're...</i>

1:12:08.692 --> 1:12:12.794
<i>you have kind of a choice
what to do with that grief.</i>

1:12:12.796 --> 1:12:16.497
<i>You can either let it kind
of, keep you stuck in bed</i>

1:12:16.499 --> 1:12:20.001
- or it can be your <i>motivation to get out.
- Okay.</i>

1:12:20.003 --> 1:12:22.403
<i>Because Randy sounds like
he was a really good guy.</i>

1:12:22.405 --> 1:12:23.938
[chuckles] He was.

1:12:24.873 --> 1:12:28.776
<i>And Randy wouldn't have wanted
you to just lay in that bed and feel bad.</i>

1:12:28.778 --> 1:12:29.877
No.

1:12:29.945 --> 1:12:32.880
<i>So one of the best ways to get
over the grief of Randy</i>

1:12:32.882 --> 1:12:34.849
<i>would be to live a full life</i>

1:12:34.851 --> 1:12:35.917
<i>and make him proud of you.</i>

1:12:35.919 --> 1:12:37.185
Okay.

1:12:37.187 --> 1:12:39.387
<i>Do you think
he's watching you now?</i>

1:12:39.389 --> 1:12:41.089
Oh, I know he is.

1:12:41.091 --> 1:12:42.924
<i>So, impress him.</i>

1:12:42.958 --> 1:12:44.992
Okay.

1:12:44.994 --> 1:12:46.828
<i>Lisa, I'm optimistic for you.</i>

1:12:46.830 --> 1:12:49.497
<i>You can do more
than you think you can.</i>

1:12:49.499 --> 1:12:51.999
<i>I think you're gonna
impress yourself.</i>

1:12:52.001 --> 1:12:54.602
- Okay.
<i>- With your ability to get up and do stuff.</i>

1:12:54.604 --> 1:12:56.838
<i>It was great to talk to you,</i>

1:12:56.840 --> 1:12:58.873
<i>take care
and we'll keep in touch, okay?</i>

1:12:58.875 --> 1:13:00.775
All right. Thank you.

1:13:00.777 --> 1:13:02.009
<i>- Bye, Lisa.
- Bye-bye.</i>

1:13:02.011 --> 1:13:03.277
[call disconnects]

1:13:06.849 --> 1:13:07.949
[Lisa] Thank you.

1:13:07.951 --> 1:13:08.883
[Desi] How'd it go?

1:13:08.885 --> 1:13:10.918
It was fine.

1:13:10.920 --> 1:13:12.420
- How do you feel?
- How do you feel?

1:13:12.888 --> 1:13:13.855
I feel okay.

1:13:13.857 --> 1:13:15.957
He told me I need to start

1:13:16.658 --> 1:13:18.393
doing more things for myself

1:13:18.395 --> 1:13:20.661
and trying to get
up out of this...

1:13:20.663 --> 1:13:23.164
you know, my feet on the floor.

1:13:23.166 --> 1:13:25.900
Sitting up, I don't know about
sitting up...

1:13:25.902 --> 1:13:26.734
We can help you.

1:13:26.736 --> 1:13:28.002
Which is a hard thing for me

1:13:28.004 --> 1:13:30.238
- but I'm just going to do it.
- Yeah.

1:13:30.240 --> 1:13:32.073
Suck it up, buttercup.

1:13:32.075 --> 1:13:32.974
[Lisa laughs]

1:13:32.976 --> 1:13:35.042
I had such a great life

1:13:35.044 --> 1:13:38.312
and I don't know
why I destroyed it.

1:13:38.314 --> 1:13:39.747
You still have it.

1:13:39.749 --> 1:13:41.849
We just gotta get you
up and moving, okay?

1:13:41.851 --> 1:13:43.684
- Yeah.
- All right.

1:13:43.686 --> 1:13:45.987
And I'm here to help you
every step of the way.

1:13:45.989 --> 1:13:48.089
- Yeah.
- We'll do this together.

1:14:02.938 --> 1:14:05.540
- Hi there, Lis.
- Hello. How are you?

1:14:05.542 --> 1:14:07.542
- Good. How are you?
- I'm okay.

1:14:07.544 --> 1:14:10.812
- Good. I'm Staci, the physical therapist.
- Yeah.

1:14:10.814 --> 1:14:13.781
- And we're going to go over a few exercises.
- Okay.

1:14:13.783 --> 1:14:15.983
- It's all right? Okay.
- Yep.

1:14:15.985 --> 1:14:18.986
<i>[Lisa] I've been stressed
out over physical therapy.</i>

1:14:18.988 --> 1:14:20.655
<i>I don't think I can do this.</i>

1:14:20.657 --> 1:14:23.791
<i>But it's time for me
to take care of me.</i>

1:14:23.793 --> 1:14:25.693
It might be a little late
but we'll try.

1:14:25.695 --> 1:14:27.195
How about this?

1:14:27.197 --> 1:14:30.765
- We're gonna start with some arm exercises, okay?
- Okay.

1:14:30.767 --> 1:14:33.768
Just to start with I'm just gonna
have you raise your arms up over head

1:14:33.770 --> 1:14:37.238
and back down and you had
physical therapy earlier, is that right?

1:14:37.240 --> 1:14:38.840
- You had that? No? Okay.
- Not today, no.

1:14:38.842 --> 1:14:40.007
Okay. Good.

1:14:40.009 --> 1:14:41.375
We're gonna do 10 of these.

1:14:41.377 --> 1:14:42.844
That sound right?

1:14:42.846 --> 1:14:46.113
I want you to let me know if
anything is sore, if anything hurts.

1:14:46.115 --> 1:14:50.218
- Okay. All right.
- Yeah, like your arms get tired, okay? Okay.

1:14:51.920 --> 1:14:52.620
- Good.
- [grunts]

1:14:52.622 --> 1:14:54.822
You will just have to

1:14:54.824 --> 1:14:57.758
tell me about legs, 'cause I
got some sores on my legs.

1:14:57.760 --> 1:15:01.062
Okay. I've got some exercises
for legs too

1:15:01.064 --> 1:15:02.864
and I've brought some gloves,
so we can check that out.

1:15:02.866 --> 1:15:04.899
- Okay.
- Okay.

1:15:04.901 --> 1:15:08.069
So, I also brought
some bands with me.

1:15:08.403 --> 1:15:10.972
Let's do this.

1:15:10.974 --> 1:15:13.407
I'm gonna have you grab
a hold on this band.

1:15:13.409 --> 1:15:15.042
[Lisa] Okay.

1:15:16.111 --> 1:15:17.512
[grunts softly]

1:15:17.579 --> 1:15:20.548
[clears throat] And I want you to
just in front of you, just gonna...

1:15:20.550 --> 1:15:22.416
Yep. Perfect.

1:15:22.418 --> 1:15:24.952
- Does that feel okay? Okay.
- Yeah.

1:15:28.390 --> 1:15:29.957
[Staci] Good job.

1:15:33.395 --> 1:15:34.962
Eight.

1:15:36.131 --> 1:15:37.365
Nine.

1:15:38.734 --> 1:15:39.867
Ten. Perfect.

1:15:39.869 --> 1:15:42.537
Now I'm gonna have you try this.

1:15:42.539 --> 1:15:45.840
I'm gonna have you hold
that band in front of you

1:15:45.842 --> 1:15:47.742
and you're gonna try
to just raise it up.

1:15:47.744 --> 1:15:49.010
- Okay.
- Okay.

1:15:49.012 --> 1:15:50.311
Let's do ten of those.

1:15:51.947 --> 1:15:53.080
Three.

1:15:53.782 --> 1:15:55.216
Four.

1:15:55.218 --> 1:15:57.184
- Does that feel okay?
- Yeah.

1:16:00.422 --> 1:16:02.323
[Staci] Seven.

1:16:02.891 --> 1:16:03.991
Eight.

1:16:03.993 --> 1:16:05.259
Good job. Two more.

1:16:05.961 --> 1:16:06.727
Nine.

1:16:06.762 --> 1:16:08.396
Ten. Good.

1:16:08.398 --> 1:16:10.665
How about this? Let's do
a few things with your legs.

1:16:10.667 --> 1:16:13.668
We'll give your arms a break. Do
your arms feel like they're tired at all?

1:16:13.670 --> 1:16:17.772
- This arm does but this one's fine.
- Okay. Okay.

1:16:17.774 --> 1:16:20.274
I'm gonna have you just
to start with, with your feet,

1:16:20.276 --> 1:16:22.276
I just want you
to pump 'em up and down.

1:16:22.278 --> 1:16:23.411
Good.

1:16:27.015 --> 1:16:28.950
Good.

1:16:30.052 --> 1:16:31.819
Does that hurt that spot at all?

1:16:31.821 --> 1:16:32.620
Good.

1:16:32.622 --> 1:16:34.088
So, let's do this.

1:16:34.090 --> 1:16:35.990
I'm gonna have you try to push
your knee down

1:16:35.992 --> 1:16:39.026
into the bed, so you're really
tightening these muscles up.

1:16:39.028 --> 1:16:41.195
Let's do ten of those, okay?

1:16:41.897 --> 1:16:43.564
Any pain with that?

1:16:43.566 --> 1:16:46.033
- My knees hurt a little bit.
- Are they?

1:16:46.868 --> 1:16:49.270
-Okay.
-[Lisa] Nothing unusual. [chuckles]

1:16:49.738 --> 1:16:51.038
Good job.

1:16:52.407 --> 1:16:54.408
Last one right here. Perfect.

1:16:54.410 --> 1:16:56.010
So, let's try to go out
to the side.

1:16:56.012 --> 1:16:56.844
Good.

1:16:56.846 --> 1:16:58.913
Probably easier to go in.

1:16:58.915 --> 1:17:00.314
And then back in. Okay.
And then back out.

1:17:01.183 --> 1:17:02.183
Good.

1:17:02.951 --> 1:17:04.018
Two.

1:17:05.120 --> 1:17:06.020
Three.

1:17:06.022 --> 1:17:07.855
Good job.

1:17:07.857 --> 1:17:10.024
- Any pain with that?
- Uh-uh.

1:17:11.026 --> 1:17:12.927
Ten. Good job. Okay.

1:17:12.929 --> 1:17:15.162
I'm gonna try
the other side, all right?

1:17:16.832 --> 1:17:18.099
[Desi] You're doing a good job.

1:17:18.101 --> 1:17:19.367
[Cameron] You're doing
great, Lisa.

1:17:19.968 --> 1:17:21.102
[Staci] Six.

1:17:22.070 --> 1:17:23.137
Seven.

1:17:23.939 --> 1:17:25.072
Eight.

1:17:25.741 --> 1:17:27.174
Nine.

1:17:28.076 --> 1:17:29.443
Ten. Good job, Lisa.
Okay.

1:17:30.946 --> 1:17:32.113
All right.

1:17:32.414 --> 1:17:33.114
Okay.

1:17:33.116 --> 1:17:34.649
So, we're gonna try this.

1:17:34.651 --> 1:17:36.817
I want you to try to slide,

1:17:36.819 --> 1:17:38.386
so that you're...
yep, you're bending knee up.

1:17:38.388 --> 1:17:40.321
Good. And then back down.
Good.

1:17:42.224 --> 1:17:44.025
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

1:17:44.027 --> 1:17:45.159
[Staci] Three.

1:17:45.627 --> 1:17:47.895
Four.

1:17:47.897 --> 1:17:50.598
Are these guys usually here
that they can help you with these

1:17:50.600 --> 1:17:51.966
- Yeah.
- Types of exercises?

1:17:51.968 --> 1:17:53.734
One of them always
has to be here.

1:17:53.736 --> 1:17:55.169
- 'Cause they don't let me be alone.
- Okay.

1:17:56.071 --> 1:17:56.570
[Staci] All right.

1:17:56.572 --> 1:17:57.905
So, how about this?

1:17:57.907 --> 1:18:00.174
Does that give you a few
things to start with?

1:18:00.176 --> 1:18:01.876
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

1:18:01.878 --> 1:18:06.047
Staci is having me do stuff
that I'd never done in my life.

1:18:06.049 --> 1:18:07.748
<i>But, I tried.</i>

1:18:07.750 --> 1:18:09.416
<i>It felt good.</i>

1:18:09.418 --> 1:18:13.387
<i>Once I get my mind set to something
then I have no doubt that I can do it.</i>

1:18:13.389 --> 1:18:19.994
My plan is to do my exercises, eat
right, get my fat ass out of the bed.

1:18:19.996 --> 1:18:23.197
Is there anything,
any questions you have,

1:18:23.199 --> 1:18:28.836
or anything that you would like to go over,
discuss, that we haven't talked about?

1:18:28.838 --> 1:18:30.638
Mmm-mmm.

1:18:30.640 --> 1:18:33.574
I thought Lisa did really
well today with her exercises.

1:18:33.576 --> 1:18:37.044
She got through everything
well, and had no pain,

1:18:37.046 --> 1:18:39.880
and appears to be very
knowledgeable in the exercises,

1:18:39.882 --> 1:18:42.016
and hopefully can
continue those on her own.

1:18:42.018 --> 1:18:43.918
Thank you so much
for working with me.

1:18:43.920 --> 1:18:45.753
- Thank you so much.
- Good luck.

1:18:45.755 --> 1:18:48.022
- Thank you.
- Okay. All right.

1:18:49.324 --> 1:18:51.892
- Drive careful.
- Ah, thank you.

1:18:51.894 --> 1:18:54.562
- At least it's not snowing.
- True, it's not snowing.

1:18:54.564 --> 1:18:55.730
Yes.

1:18:55.732 --> 1:18:56.731
- All right, thank you, guys.
- Thank you.

1:18:56.733 --> 1:18:58.099
Goodbye. Thank you.

1:19:10.412 --> 1:19:12.847
So, when's your next doctor
appointment with Dr. Now?

1:19:12.849 --> 1:19:16.083
It's gonna be
in about three minutes.

1:19:16.085 --> 1:19:19.420
Could you, um, grab me
the computer, please?

1:19:19.422 --> 1:19:21.088
Where's the computer at?

1:19:21.090 --> 1:19:23.224
- It's in the kitchen.
- Okay, yeah, I can do that.

1:19:24.192 --> 1:19:25.292
Ooh.

1:19:27.729 --> 1:19:28.996
There it is.

1:19:29.931 --> 1:19:31.832
[Lisa] You'll have to clean
the stand out first though, hon.

1:19:31.834 --> 1:19:33.200
Huh?

1:19:33.202 --> 1:19:35.903
You have to clean the stand
off too, and sit it right there.

1:19:35.937 --> 1:19:36.737
Okay.

1:19:42.844 --> 1:19:44.311
Ha-ha. I got the pen
in my hand, Lisa.

1:19:44.980 --> 1:19:46.747
[both laugh]

1:19:46.749 --> 1:19:48.215
Mmm.

1:19:48.217 --> 1:19:50.017
Where do you want me
to set this stuff at?

1:19:50.019 --> 1:19:52.286
Any place but on that...
by that TV.

1:19:52.288 --> 1:19:53.654
Ouch.

1:19:53.656 --> 1:19:55.422
- Any place but on the TV?
- Yes, just sit it...

1:19:55.424 --> 1:19:56.991
Okay, I'll sit it right here.

1:19:57.893 --> 1:20:00.361
Here we go.
Okay, how does this open?

1:20:01.196 --> 1:20:03.397
- Turn it around.
- [whispers] Turn it around.

1:20:05.634 --> 1:20:07.001
Uh, okay.

1:20:08.103 --> 1:20:10.104
- Then, there you go.
- Thank you.

1:20:10.106 --> 1:20:11.272
You're welcome.

1:20:13.375 --> 1:20:14.642
- Okay.
- Mmm-hmm.

1:20:14.943 --> 1:20:18.012
He might wanna talk to you
anyways since you help with me.

1:20:18.014 --> 1:20:19.980
Okay, I don't mind.

1:20:19.982 --> 1:20:21.415
[video call chiming]

1:20:24.019 --> 1:20:25.085
<i>Hi, Lisa.</i>

1:20:25.119 --> 1:20:26.053
Hello.

1:20:26.055 --> 1:20:27.388
<i>How you doing?</i>

1:20:27.390 --> 1:20:29.156
I'm okay. How are you?

1:20:29.158 --> 1:20:30.324
<i>I'm doing well, thanks.</i>

1:20:30.326 --> 1:20:33.194
<i>I wanted to check and see
how you're doing</i>

1:20:33.196 --> 1:20:37.031
<i>since you have been at home
from hospital for the past month.</i>

1:20:37.033 --> 1:20:38.732
I seem to be doing okay.

1:20:38.734 --> 1:20:42.570
<i>I'm glad to hear that. That's more
positive than you usually answer.</i>

1:20:42.572 --> 1:20:44.705
<i>So, I'm happy to hear that.</i>

1:20:44.707 --> 1:20:46.540
<i>Well, how you doing with the PT?</i>

1:20:46.542 --> 1:20:50.211
<i>Because they tell me you were
cooperating when you got back home.</i>

1:20:50.213 --> 1:20:53.414
<i>But over the last month, you
haven't been doing as much,</i>

1:20:53.416 --> 1:20:56.884
<i>and you've been telling them
you're too tired and you can't do it,</i>

1:20:56.886 --> 1:20:58.786
<i>so, they have
to come back later.</i>

1:20:58.788 --> 1:21:00.487
<i>So, what's going on now?</i>

1:21:00.489 --> 1:21:01.922
<i>[Lisa] Well, I've been trying.</i>

1:21:01.924 --> 1:21:04.325
<i>All right. Are you able
to start walking?</i>

1:21:04.826 --> 1:21:06.961
<i>No, I haven't even
got out of bed yet.</i>

1:21:06.963 --> 1:21:09.897
<i>How about sitting
on the edge of the bed?</i>

1:21:09.899 --> 1:21:11.699
No, we haven't did that neither.

1:21:11.701 --> 1:21:14.168
<i>Are you working
to do that, or what?</i>

1:21:14.170 --> 1:21:15.435
Yeah, I'm gonna work on it.

1:21:15.437 --> 1:21:18.806
<i>All right. So, being in the
bed for that length of time</i>

1:21:18.808 --> 1:21:24.278
<i>you develop a fear of walking,
and I think that may be a factor here.</i>

1:21:24.280 --> 1:21:26.513
<i>You need to work
through that, okay?</i>

1:21:26.515 --> 1:21:28.115
Okay.

1:21:28.117 --> 1:21:31.518
<i>So you can work with the therapist
to work with that fear of walking.</i>

1:21:31.520 --> 1:21:32.686
<i>And that's gonna
be an important...</i>

1:21:32.688 --> 1:21:35.489
<i>Because getting up
and moving around</i>

1:21:35.491 --> 1:21:39.126
<i>is going to be a very
important step in your recovery.</i>

1:21:39.128 --> 1:21:41.462
<i>So, the first step
is to sit up in the bed.</i>

1:21:41.529 --> 1:21:42.930
Yeah.

1:21:43.398 --> 1:21:46.133
And then move to the edge of the
bed, and put your feet on the ground.

1:21:46.135 --> 1:21:47.001
Okay.

1:21:47.003 --> 1:21:48.869
And once you do that,

1:21:48.871 --> 1:21:53.274
<i>then develop your confidence
that you can get up with a walker,</i>

1:21:53.276 --> 1:21:55.175
<i>and start taking steps.</i>

1:21:55.177 --> 1:21:56.810
Okay.

1:21:57.045 --> 1:22:00.347
<i>But you need to work with a therapist
to overcome the fear of walking. Okay?</i>

1:22:00.349 --> 1:22:01.615
Okay.

1:22:01.617 --> 1:22:04.919
<i>Did you get my book I
sent you again with the diet?</i>

1:22:04.921 --> 1:22:07.554
Yeah. I owe you an apology,
'cause all that stuff is in there.

1:22:07.556 --> 1:22:09.790
I just didn't go back
far enough.

1:22:09.792 --> 1:22:14.862
<i>Well, I'm glad that you read far enough
this time so you understand the diet.</i>

1:22:14.864 --> 1:22:16.664
<i>And you got all the stuff
to help you what to do?</i>

1:22:16.666 --> 1:22:17.831
Yeah.

1:22:17.833 --> 1:22:20.434
<i>Because you lost a lot
of weight in the hospital.</i>

1:22:20.436 --> 1:22:21.702
<i>You want to continue with that.</i>

1:22:21.704 --> 1:22:23.837
<i>- You don't want to gain it back, right?
- Right.</i>

1:22:23.839 --> 1:22:26.941
<i>You got all
the right information as well.</i>

1:22:26.943 --> 1:22:28.709
<i>Follow the rules
and you will lose weight.</i>

1:22:28.711 --> 1:22:29.776
Okay.

1:22:29.844 --> 1:22:32.046
<i>How is the help
that you're getting at home?</i>

1:22:32.048 --> 1:22:34.648
Oh, they're very nice people.
It's good.

1:22:34.650 --> 1:22:36.717
<i>So, the people that are
helping you out</i>

1:22:36.719 --> 1:22:38.852
<i>with everything at home,</i>

1:22:38.854 --> 1:22:41.722
<i>they are bringing you food
how many times a day?</i>

1:22:41.789 --> 1:22:42.723
Um, three.

1:22:42.725 --> 1:22:44.825
<i>Are you snacking
between the meals?</i>

1:22:44.827 --> 1:22:49.229
Um, not the last couple
of days, no. But before, yeah.

1:22:49.231 --> 1:22:52.533
<i>Okay, well, there is no reason
for you to snack, okay?</i>

1:22:52.535 --> 1:22:53.600
Yeah.

1:22:54.302 --> 1:22:57.037
<i>And you need to cut back
on your calorie intake</i>

1:22:57.039 --> 1:22:59.440
<i>to the point that you're gonna
be able to lose some weight.</i>

1:22:59.442 --> 1:23:00.708
<i>Okay.</i>

1:23:01.109 --> 1:23:04.812
<i>And don't create the dynamic
of enabler again at home.</i>

1:23:04.814 --> 1:23:05.612
Okay.

1:23:05.614 --> 1:23:07.280
<i>If you're not hungry, don't eat</i>

1:23:07.983 --> 1:23:11.418
<i>and if you're eating, make sure that
you are eating very low-calorie food.</i>

1:23:11.519 --> 1:23:12.753
Okay.

1:23:12.755 --> 1:23:15.556
<i>At most about 400 calories
two or three times a day.</i>

1:23:15.558 --> 1:23:16.991
Okay.

1:23:16.993 --> 1:23:18.225
<i>And if you do that,
you will lose weight.</i>

1:23:18.460 --> 1:23:19.693
Okay?

1:23:19.695 --> 1:23:22.696
<i>So, this is what you need
to concentrate on.</i>

1:23:22.698 --> 1:23:25.399
- Okay.
<i>- To continue losing weight.</i>

1:23:25.401 --> 1:23:29.903
<i>And continue getting your
strength up and be up walking,</i>

1:23:29.905 --> 1:23:33.240
<i>so you get to the point that
you can travel into Houston.</i>

1:23:33.242 --> 1:23:34.241
Okay.

1:23:34.243 --> 1:23:37.244
<i>So, make sure you
work with PT to get up.</i>

1:23:37.246 --> 1:23:41.682
<i>Don't keep sending him away because
you're tired and you don't want to do it.</i>

1:23:41.684 --> 1:23:42.783
Okay.

1:23:42.851 --> 1:23:45.419
<i>This is that chance for you
to do the program.</i>

1:23:45.421 --> 1:23:47.621
<i>So, do that,
and sit with that diet,</i>

1:23:47.623 --> 1:23:51.625
<i>and if you have anything you need, give
me a call, and then we'll go from there.</i>

1:23:51.627 --> 1:23:53.961
<i>[Lisa] I'll make sure
I do those.</i>

1:23:53.963 --> 1:23:58.132
<i>Okay. Your next big goal is to
have your feet on the ground.</i>

1:23:58.134 --> 1:24:00.901
<i>And you can tell me if you
need anything. Give me a call.</i>

1:24:00.903 --> 1:24:02.369
Okay, thank you kindly.

1:24:02.371 --> 1:24:04.071
<i>All right. You're welcome.</i>

1:24:06.241 --> 1:24:10.544
I am encouraged that Lisa seemed
to have had a better disposition,

1:24:10.546 --> 1:24:14.481
<i>and at least she started
cooperating with PT.</i>

1:24:14.483 --> 1:24:18.085
<i>But at the same time, she doesn't
look to have lost much weight</i>

1:24:18.087 --> 1:24:20.888
<i>since she has been home
from the hospital.</i>

1:24:20.890 --> 1:24:23.824
<i>It is positive that she has
read the diet this time.</i>

1:24:23.826 --> 1:24:26.026
So, that is more than I can say

1:24:26.028 --> 1:24:28.929
<i>for how much she was willing
to do in the beginning.</i>

1:24:28.931 --> 1:24:33.734
<i>But my big concern right now is
that she's clearly losing momentum.</i>

1:24:33.736 --> 1:24:36.236
<i>She finally started
working with PT</i>

1:24:36.238 --> 1:24:39.006
after she came home
from the hospital.

1:24:39.008 --> 1:24:44.311
<i>But after they got past simple exercises,
she stopped cooperating with them,</i>

1:24:44.313 --> 1:24:48.882
<i>telling them she was too tired when
they tried to push her to sit up at all.</i>

1:24:48.884 --> 1:24:52.719
<i>This past week, she started
telling them they have to come back,</i>

1:24:52.721 --> 1:24:55.422
<i>like she was doing
in the beginning.</i>

1:24:55.424 --> 1:24:58.392
So, I'm worried she's
going back to her old habits.

1:24:58.394 --> 1:25:03.597
<i>But right now, we will focus on
positive we have been seeing from her.</i>

1:25:03.599 --> 1:25:06.467
And continue to get PT
to push her to get up.

1:25:06.469 --> 1:25:09.536
<i>And see if we can continue
to get her weight down more.</i>

1:25:09.538 --> 1:25:13.774
<i>But just like in the beginning,
this is all still up to her.</i>

1:25:13.776 --> 1:25:18.078
<i>And it's gonna come down to whether
she's gonna put in the hard work</i>

1:25:18.080 --> 1:25:20.147
and simply doing
what she needs or not.
