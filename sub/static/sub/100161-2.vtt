<i>Previously,
on</i> "Ray Donovan"...

00:21.954 --> 00:23.814
I've got you.
You okay?

00:35.619 --> 00:36.825
Two...

00:36.913 --> 00:38.291
Three!

00:41.193 --> 00:42.539
<i>You brought
him there yourself,</i>

00:42.627 --> 00:46.478
but in the end, you said
he walked in on his own, right?

00:46.774 --> 00:48.147
<i>Yeah.</i>

00:56.847 --> 00:58.400
You okay?

00:59.722 --> 01:01.744
I don't think
I wanna be married.

01:19.697 --> 01:21.877
Did you get anywhere
with Kevin Sullivan?

01:22.344 --> 01:23.416
The fuck...

01:23.504 --> 01:25.197
You need to honor the deal.

01:25.687 --> 01:27.142
A Taurus .9 millimeter.

01:27.309 --> 01:28.384
Yep.

01:34.845 --> 01:37.369
<i>We've worked with quite a few
people with your condition.</i>

01:37.457 --> 01:39.070
They come to us
when the western meds

01:39.158 --> 01:41.407
aren't doing it
for them anymore.

01:46.599 --> 01:47.825
<i>Here to see
Michael Donovan</i>

01:47.913 --> 01:49.790
Bus hasn't
gotten here yet.

02:09.948 --> 02:12.145
When I was around
ten years old my, uh,

02:12.473 --> 02:15.380
mother was diagnosed
with ovarian cancer.

02:15.468 --> 02:16.669
Uh‐huh.

02:17.161 --> 02:19.848
Terry and I went out
lookin' for Mick,

02:19.936 --> 02:22.527
you know, tell him
what the doctor said.

02:23.088 --> 02:24.795
You went looking for him?

02:24.999 --> 02:26.333
He wasn't there with you?

02:26.491 --> 02:28.684
Yeah,
that point he was

02:28.889 --> 02:31.263
already shackin' up
with Claudette on East Eighth,

02:31.504 --> 02:33.200
hustlin' cocaine.

02:34.091 --> 02:35.934
Who was looking
after your mother?

02:36.158 --> 02:37.216
Me.

02:37.907 --> 02:39.309
My sister, Bridge.

02:40.357 --> 02:41.567
Mostly me.

02:42.955 --> 02:44.309
You were ten.

02:45.893 --> 02:47.388
What was that like for you?

02:49.238 --> 02:52.106
I remember wakin' up
one night, hearin' her...

02:52.551 --> 02:54.036
screamin' my name.

02:55.481 --> 02:57.325
I go down to her room.

02:58.896 --> 03:01.200
At this point, the pain
is tearin' her apart.

03:03.091 --> 03:06.614
She takes my hand, tells me
to get in bed with her.

03:07.816 --> 03:09.572
So I do.

03:11.594 --> 03:13.591
I wrap my arms
around her.

03:16.034 --> 03:18.520
I remember feeling
her leg against my leg.

03:19.599 --> 03:21.083
All of a sudden I...

03:21.434 --> 03:24.223
I felt something warm and...
wet.

03:26.110 --> 03:27.559
She pissed the bed.

03:28.168 --> 03:29.772
So I went down to the kitchen
to get a towel,

03:29.859 --> 03:31.638
you know, something
to clean her up with...

03:32.804 --> 03:34.169
And there he is.

03:36.559 --> 03:38.466
I ain't seen him
in over a month and...

03:39.676 --> 03:40.706
he's standin' on a chair

03:40.794 --> 03:42.243
with his hand
in Mom's coffee can.

03:42.330 --> 03:45.895
Probably about,
I don't know, $500 in there.

03:47.606 --> 03:49.325
Puts the money in his pocket,

03:50.216 --> 03:52.380
pats me on the head
and walks out the door.

Hey, Kevin Sullivan
needs more time.

07:19.649 --> 07:21.009
You okay?

07:25.465 --> 07:27.587
How much cash
can you pull together?

07:28.736 --> 07:29.903
How soon?

07:29.991 --> 07:31.200
Today.

07:32.880 --> 07:34.244
Hundred grand.

07:34.665 --> 07:35.665
Who's it for?

07:36.134 --> 07:37.395
Mac's widow.

07:38.235 --> 07:40.080
Ah, let me have a look.

08:47.988 --> 08:49.099
What are you doin' here?

08:49.593 --> 08:51.066
Can I come in?

09:00.077 --> 09:01.355
The police been by here?

09:01.566 --> 09:02.860
Couple of hours ago.

09:03.385 --> 09:04.879
What'd ya tell 'em?

09:05.020 --> 09:07.060
That Mac had nothin'
to do with it.

09:08.183 --> 09:10.425
‐ He didn't kill anybody, Ray.
‐ I didn't say that.

09:10.513 --> 09:12.285
Then what the fuck
are you doin' here?

09:13.625 --> 09:15.627
You lost Mac's pension,
right?

09:19.015 --> 09:20.527
I can help with that.

09:21.841 --> 09:24.386
Mac wanted to make sure you
and Jimmy were provided for,

09:24.573 --> 09:26.091
got a fresh start.

09:26.784 --> 09:28.910
You offering me money, Ray?

09:30.602 --> 09:32.254
Someone's gotta
take the rap.

09:39.548 --> 09:41.043
How much we talkin'?

09:42.683 --> 09:44.433
Whatever his pension
woulda been.

09:45.793 --> 09:48.222
I'm gonna need Mac's gun,
his clothes, and...

09:48.868 --> 09:51.113
whatever else they gave you
from the morgue that night.

09:53.627 --> 09:54.972
His stuff's upstairs.

10:13.765 --> 10:15.847
‐ Ray!
‐ Hey, kid.

10:16.146 --> 10:18.425
‐ How's school?
‐ It sucks.

10:18.521 --> 10:20.910
Yeah?
Sorry about that.

10:21.016 --> 10:22.894
I asked my mom
if I can go back

10:22.982 --> 10:25.252
and take some more boxing
lessons, but she said no.

10:25.340 --> 10:28.029
Jimmy, go upstairs
and do your homework.

10:28.550 --> 10:29.699
Bye, Ray.

10:29.787 --> 10:31.058
See ya.

10:51.357 --> 10:53.401
I'll get ya the money
later today.

12:26.088 --> 12:28.582
Aiding and abetting
escape from lawful custody.

12:29.098 --> 12:30.371
Second degree murder.

12:30.459 --> 12:31.925
Twenty years, Walpole.

12:32.338 --> 12:34.215
Armed robbery.
A pot store.

12:34.578 --> 12:36.761
Michael Donovan
wins again, baby.

12:39.217 --> 12:40.402
Where we at?

12:40.769 --> 12:42.488
Still looking at Ray Donovan.

12:42.576 --> 12:44.767
‐ Any movement?
‐ Talked to McGrath's wife.

12:44.855 --> 12:46.246
She seems nervous.

12:46.334 --> 12:48.753
Talked to Clancy's family,
Radulovic's family.

12:48.841 --> 12:49.978
Bianchi's girlfriend.

12:50.081 --> 12:51.667
They're playing it
close to the vest.

12:51.814 --> 12:53.519
Following up on
Donovan's whereabouts,

12:53.607 --> 12:55.222
seeing what kinda alibi
he's got.

12:55.318 --> 12:56.699
‐ You wanna bring him in?
‐ Soon.

12:56.787 --> 12:58.058
Need a couple of pieces

12:58.227 --> 12:59.980
or another head to come up.

13:04.162 --> 13:07.089
Little less eating,
more detecting, gentlemen.

13:09.152 --> 13:10.222
<i>So...</i>

13:10.445 --> 13:11.792
no casket?

13:12.405 --> 13:13.978
We got nothin' to bury.

13:14.066 --> 13:16.753
Yeah, he, uh,
got burnt up in the fire.

13:17.915 --> 13:19.416
An urn?

13:20.730 --> 13:23.019
We got nothin'
to put in an urn.

13:23.733 --> 13:24.902
A memorial.

13:25.753 --> 13:27.910
‐ A what?
‐ A memorial.

13:28.471 --> 13:29.847
What's a memorial?

13:30.026 --> 13:31.511
Let me show you.

13:32.359 --> 13:34.464
Our Eternal Flames
are popular.

13:34.716 --> 13:36.213
They come in four styles...

13:36.434 --> 13:38.574
Infinity, New Dawn,

13:38.785 --> 13:41.542
Dimensions, and Earth & Sky.

13:42.020 --> 13:43.683
I‐I don't fuckin' know.

13:43.886 --> 13:45.425
Bunch, what do you think?

13:45.962 --> 13:47.103
I dunno.

13:47.238 --> 13:49.355
It's fuckin' ridiculous.
We got nothin' to bury.

13:49.582 --> 13:51.386
I like this Eternal Flame.

13:52.425 --> 13:55.183
But I also like... the urn.

13:58.905 --> 14:00.456
We should get both.

14:01.769 --> 14:03.113
Yeah.

14:04.180 --> 14:07.346
Oh, you do good work.
That looks nice.

14:07.753 --> 14:09.371
You got a photo for it?

14:10.815 --> 14:12.178
A‐A photo?

14:12.558 --> 14:15.378
Of the deceased.
To put on the urn.

14:16.488 --> 14:18.449
Uh, y... uh, yeah.

14:43.419 --> 14:45.386
‐ <i>Hey, Mom.</i>
‐ Hey, Daryll.

14:45.474 --> 14:46.525
How you doing?

14:46.613 --> 14:49.214
Uh, you know, uh...
hey, listen, Ma.

14:49.317 --> 14:52.839
Do you, um,
have a picture of Dad?

14:52.927 --> 14:54.509
<i>I'm hoping, like,
you have like something</i>

14:54.596 --> 14:55.969
<i>when he was, like, young.</i>

14:56.064 --> 14:57.902
‐ Like on the paper.
‐ Honey, I threw

14:58.005 --> 15:00.032
all that shit out
when Alan and I moved on

15:00.120 --> 15:01.417
to Southridge Drive.

15:01.505 --> 15:02.753
<i>Why do you want that?</i>

15:02.841 --> 15:06.121
I need a picture
for his urn.

15:07.230 --> 15:08.855
<i>Mickey died, Ma.</i>

15:09.650 --> 15:13.589
Will you, um, come out, Ma?

15:14.381 --> 15:15.589
<i>Will you do it for me?</i>

15:16.229 --> 15:17.772
I'm askin' for me, Ma.

15:20.784 --> 15:22.464
I was supposed
to go see him

15:22.552 --> 15:24.191
the day he got transferred.

15:25.277 --> 15:27.011
I got the second shift.

15:28.957 --> 15:31.503
My dad died of a heart
attack two years ago.

15:32.027 --> 15:33.878
Knocked me on my ass.

15:34.831 --> 15:37.038
Just...
weird,

15:37.331 --> 15:38.941
you know?

15:39.443 --> 15:41.722
I mean,
ever since I was a kid,

15:41.953 --> 15:43.433
he was there.

15:45.230 --> 15:46.833
Even when he wasn't.

15:49.038 --> 15:50.605
I'm sorry.

15:55.487 --> 15:56.727
Open the goddamn safe!

15:56.878 --> 15:58.251
I‐I don't got
the combination.

15:58.339 --> 15:59.988
<i>- The fuck you don't!
- I don't!</i>

16:00.076 --> 16:02.174
<i>‐ I don't... no combination!
‐ Look, I don't have time.</i>

16:02.261 --> 16:04.097
<i>‐ Give it to me!
‐ It's on a timer!</i>

16:04.184 --> 16:05.456
<i>I don't got the combination!</i>

16:05.544 --> 16:07.988
Open the cash drawer,
then... do what I tell you.

16:08.076 --> 16:11.326
- Put everything in a bag.
- Come on, get moving.

16:12.394 --> 16:14.825
Everyone's wallets
and cell phones... now!

16:14.913 --> 16:17.819
Do what he says!
You...

16:17.906 --> 16:19.404
Open the other register.

16:19.491 --> 16:22.031
Come on, bitch,
I don't got all day!

16:22.118 --> 16:24.747
‐ Hey!
‐ What the fuck?

16:25.395 --> 16:26.942
Get down.

16:27.598 --> 16:28.814
No.

16:28.917 --> 16:30.088
Get on the floor,

16:30.176 --> 16:32.340
or I'll put a bullet
in your fucking head!

16:32.567 --> 16:34.881
Yeah?
Go ahead.

16:36.809 --> 16:39.350
‐ Gimme the gun.
‐ No.

16:41.614 --> 16:43.176
Give me
the fucking gun!

16:49.113 --> 16:51.434
Put your fucking guns down now.

16:51.606 --> 16:52.895
Fuck you, man!

16:53.083 --> 16:54.522
Fuck you.

16:55.169 --> 16:57.528
Put your guns down
and get the fuck outta here.

16:57.903 --> 16:59.073
You don't
<i>know</i> me, all right?

16:59.161 --> 17:01.362
Yeah?
You don't fuckin' know me.

17:01.450 --> 17:02.488
Let's get outta here, man!

17:02.575 --> 17:03.676
Fuck that, man.

17:03.764 --> 17:06.042
‐ Fuck that!
‐ Man, fuck this, man!

17:07.292 --> 17:08.269
Jesus!

17:08.357 --> 17:11.800
Put the fucking gun down.
‐ Okay, okay, okay.

17:11.887 --> 17:13.428
Don't shoot me, man,
please.

17:13.662 --> 17:15.577
It's down, it's down,
it's down, okay?

17:15.882 --> 17:18.636
You're fucking crazy, man.
Shit!

17:20.361 --> 17:23.222
‐ Who is it?
‐ Terry, it's me, Daryll.

17:23.430 --> 17:24.824
It's open.

17:28.770 --> 17:30.152
Hey.

17:34.307 --> 17:35.839
You holdin' up?

17:36.036 --> 17:37.824
Why wouldn't I be
holdin' up?

17:38.486 --> 17:40.568
‐ You didn't talk to Ray?
‐ About what?

17:41.316 --> 17:42.964
Gimme a beer, will ya?

17:44.245 --> 17:46.160
That's weird, 'cause...

17:46.328 --> 17:48.872
I figured Ray woulda
called you first.

17:49.792 --> 17:51.683
I lost my phone.

17:55.712 --> 17:57.505
Terry, Mickey's dead.

17:59.376 --> 18:00.824
He's what?

18:02.093 --> 18:04.801
He was killed in a...

18:05.175 --> 18:08.428
a bus accident last night
goin' upstate.

18:09.050 --> 18:10.682
Me and, um...

18:11.682 --> 18:15.574
Bunch were at the, uh,
funeral home this morning.

18:15.902 --> 18:18.847
Bunchy wants to get
everyone together tonight,

18:19.135 --> 18:20.783
and, you know,
I figured I'd come by,

18:20.871 --> 18:24.746
see if you had any photos
of Pop for the Eternal Flame.

18:24.905 --> 18:26.683
Uh, he's... he's dead?

18:28.441 --> 18:29.688
Yeah.

18:29.775 --> 18:30.981
Last night?

18:31.246 --> 18:33.480
Yeah, I don't
believe it either.

18:33.568 --> 18:34.861
It's just crazy.

18:37.542 --> 18:39.160
Here, gimme your phone.

18:45.916 --> 18:47.410
T, do you got any, uh,

18:47.542 --> 18:49.761

around here?

18:50.502 --> 18:52.011
Uh...

18:53.347 --> 18:55.839
Yeah, try the...
try the box on the shelf.

19:00.605 --> 19:01.587
Hey, Daryll.

19:01.675 --> 19:03.269
No, it... it's Terry.

19:03.917 --> 19:05.917
I‐I just heard about Mick.

19:07.204 --> 19:08.451
Are ya all right?

19:08.799 --> 19:10.792
Yeah.
You?

19:10.880 --> 19:12.336
Yeah.

19:12.586 --> 19:14.292
Yeah, but Bunchy says
he wants

19:14.380 --> 19:15.941
to get everyone together
tonight.

19:16.496 --> 19:17.536
All right.

19:17.761 --> 19:19.347
<i>Your place?</i>

19:20.894 --> 19:22.116
Sure.

19:22.675 --> 19:24.243
Ray...

19:24.722 --> 19:26.550
I, uh...

19:27.086 --> 19:28.333
I had a vision.

19:28.808 --> 19:32.355
<i>Last night,
before I heard.</i>

19:32.775 --> 19:35.858
I swear to God,
I, uh, I had a vision

19:35.946 --> 19:37.535
that Mick was dead.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.761
I‐I saw... I saw him.

19:45.371 --> 19:46.785
I'll see ya tonight.

19:46.935 --> 19:48.683
<i>Breaking news now
of a robbery</i>

19:48.810 --> 19:51.267
<i>at a downtown pharmacy
where three armed men</i>

19:51.355 --> 19:54.136
<i>held employees and customers
at gunpoint.</i>

19:54.224 --> 19:56.764
<i>They were foiled by one
heroic pharmacy worker...</i>

19:57.346 --> 19:59.058
Gimme a bottle
of that Remison.

19:59.146 --> 20:00.503
<i>...disarming the thugs.</i>

20:00.592 --> 20:02.628
<i>I don't know
about that, I mean,</i>

20:02.863 --> 20:04.347
<i>I didn't really
think about it.</i>

20:04.536 --> 20:06.074
<i>Did what anyone
would've done</i>

20:06.162 --> 20:08.566
<i>to protect innocent people
from being robbed, you know?</i>

20:08.654 --> 20:11.558
<i>Uh, 'cause that's what
a person does</i>

20:11.646 --> 20:12.706
<i>in a situation like that.</i>

20:12.794 --> 20:14.488
Guy's a regular
Bernhard fuckin' Goetz.

20:14.576 --> 20:15.808
<i>...one of the assailants</i>

20:15.896 --> 20:17.542
<i>was wounded in the melee.</i>

20:17.875 --> 20:20.910
<i>He is a minor,
now in critical condition.</i>

20:26.456 --> 20:28.790
- Yeah?
- <i>Is this Ray Donovan?</i>

20:28.878 --> 20:29.725
Who's this?

20:29.812 --> 20:31.074
Kevin Sullivan.

20:31.897 --> 20:33.199
I'm sure you would agree

20:33.287 --> 20:34.769
that things have gotten
out of hand.

20:35.277 --> 20:36.613
Please be here within the hour.

20:36.701 --> 20:39.036
I'll have my secretary
text you the address.

21:00.462 --> 21:02.167
Terry, is this
all you got?

21:02.331 --> 21:04.964
‐ What?
‐ Yeah, I mean, of Mickey.

21:06.081 --> 21:07.824
Well, what's wrong
with that one?

21:08.596 --> 21:10.605
What's wrong
was I ain't in it.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.352
Well, I don't... I don't
got no photographs

21:13.439 --> 21:16.042
after my mother died
and he shacked up with yours.

21:17.724 --> 21:19.347
Okay, what's that
supposed to mean?

21:19.778 --> 21:20.855
Well, if you and your mom

21:20.943 --> 21:21.985
want a shot from
"Diff'rent Strokes,"

21:22.072 --> 21:24.158
you shoulda taken it
your fuckin' self.

21:26.463 --> 21:27.910
Wow.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.206
I'll see you tonight.

21:45.949 --> 21:48.300
The Renegade
Craft Fair on November seventh.

21:48.988 --> 21:51.308
Documentary Film Festival.

21:51.527 --> 21:53.511
Ice skating in Bryant Park.

21:53.924 --> 21:55.878
Yo, Ray made dinner
the other night.

21:56.383 --> 21:57.525
We were all there.

21:57.746 --> 21:59.441
- He what?
- Yeah, tilapia.

21:59.583 --> 22:02.175
We could say that we were
all having like a dinner!

22:02.558 --> 22:03.839
Uh, I mean, you could,

22:03.927 --> 22:05.696
but then it's just family
vouching for family,

22:05.783 --> 22:07.072
and that never holds up.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.410
We could say
we were with you.

22:08.505 --> 22:10.586
Wait... November seventh,
Jonathan Walker Hanson

22:10.727 --> 22:12.503

23:31.607 --> 23:33.524

23:44.991 --> 23:48.269

23:49.693 --> 23:51.527
Four backstage passes too.

23:51.980 --> 23:53.314
Why?

23:53.487 --> 23:55.638
Just four tickets
from a show.

23:55.726 --> 23:57.136
In a row.

23:58.588 --> 24:00.145
You know, normally when
people ask me for tickets,

24:00.232 --> 24:01.737
it's for shows that'll happen
in the future.

24:01.824 --> 24:03.831
But for you,
I will make an exception.

24:03.919 --> 24:05.792
Thank you.
We need them right away.

24:05.880 --> 24:07.410
Well, they are
comin' right up.

24:07.744 --> 24:09.714

concert

24:41.505 --> 24:43.044
with Bridget, Smitty,
and Daryll.

24:43.132 --> 24:45.300
- All right, Ray?
- <i>Sure.</i>

24:45.388 --> 24:47.220

- ‐

24:48.225 --> 24:50.042
‐ Hey.
‐ Hi.

24:53.248 --> 24:54.831
So what's up
with your boss?

24:54.919 --> 24:56.251
What are you talking about?

24:57.580 --> 24:58.971
What?

24:59.059 --> 25:00.566
Nothing.

25:01.365 --> 25:04.714
Just promise me
you're not gonna get pregnant.

25:05.424 --> 25:06.879
I'm serious.

25:06.998 --> 25:08.667
Seriously,
not with Smitty,

25:08.755 --> 25:09.817
and definitely
not with that guy.

25:09.904 --> 25:11.402
Jesus.

25:11.938 --> 25:13.380
I care about you.

25:15.295 --> 25:16.959
What's goin' on?

25:19.216 --> 25:20.547
I'm gonna go back to I. A.

25:20.938 --> 25:22.326
When?

25:23.006 --> 25:25.271
‐ Tomorrow.
‐ How long?

25:25.862 --> 25:27.216
For good.

25:27.982 --> 25:30.646
For good?
You're quitting?

25:30.734 --> 25:33.278
I can't be alone anymore,
Bridge.

25:35.720 --> 25:37.435
But I still love you.

25:38.513 --> 25:40.935
You ever need anything,
call me, all right?

25:54.683 --> 25:56.427
Hello.

25:59.334 --> 26:01.896
You don't remember me,
do you?

26:05.466 --> 26:07.146
Ray Donovan.

26:07.503 --> 26:09.849
Need any more snapshots
for your photo album?

26:10.021 --> 26:12.498
Mind if I keep my clothes on
this time?

26:13.717 --> 26:16.341
I assume you figured out
who my father is now.

26:18.445 --> 26:21.552
Your boss threatened me
with going to the D. A.,

26:22.021 --> 26:24.763
trumping up charges
of child endangerment,

26:24.950 --> 26:26.912
sexual abuse of a minor.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.232
‐ Did you know that?
‐ Feratti's not my boss.

26:29.320 --> 26:31.349
You must agree that's insane.

26:34.935 --> 26:37.107
There's $1.5 million in there.

26:38.294 --> 26:39.568
What for?

26:39.857 --> 26:41.388
The pictures.

26:41.646 --> 26:43.169
Just honor the deal.

26:43.721 --> 26:45.678
If Feratti
goes ahead with this,

26:46.007 --> 26:48.560
if he puts that picture
in the paper, there is no deal.

26:48.756 --> 26:50.754
He knows it, I know it,
and you know it.

26:51.755 --> 26:53.888
So... instead of
talking about

26:53.976 --> 26:55.263
what won't happen,

26:55.625 --> 26:57.505
let's talk about
what can happen.

26:58.674 --> 27:01.590
I guess we got nothin'
to talk about.

27:08.179 --> 27:10.560
Can you understand
what this will do to my life?

27:11.669 --> 27:13.224
My kids?

27:14.066 --> 27:15.685
Can you understand that?

27:18.514 --> 27:20.794
I can't negotiate
for the mayor.

27:21.691 --> 27:23.459
Of course you can't.

27:24.760 --> 27:26.133
'Cause you're
a fuckin' monkey.

27:26.646 --> 27:27.912
Messenger boy.

27:28.669 --> 27:29.951
You're a pissant goon

27:30.039 --> 27:31.802
working for a bullshit mayor.

27:31.920 --> 27:34.552
You tell him three of
my lawyers used to be D. A. s,

27:34.640 --> 27:35.896
and they will tear this apart,

27:35.984 --> 27:38.138
and then they will
come after you!

27:38.381 --> 27:40.294
<i>You wanna tell me
what happened?</i>

27:41.060 --> 27:42.810
Why'd you start
drinking again?

27:43.110 --> 27:44.358
I dunno.

27:44.771 --> 27:46.769
Is this the first time
since you stopped?

27:46.857 --> 27:48.108
Yeah.

27:48.196 --> 27:49.866
How do you feel
about that?

27:49.970 --> 27:51.373
What?

27:51.461 --> 27:53.451
That you went back
to drinking.

27:54.944 --> 27:56.748
Who fucking cares?

28:08.322 --> 28:10.241
My father died last night.

28:11.604 --> 28:13.522
Jeez, I'm sorry, Ray.

28:15.206 --> 28:16.694
What for?

28:20.135 --> 28:23.491
You must have some feelings
about your father dying.

28:27.139 --> 28:30.655
Ray, it's all right
to express your feelings.

28:31.198 --> 28:33.325
To process them with me.

28:35.233 --> 28:36.940
To feel some sadness.

28:39.738 --> 28:42.862
I don't know what
the fuck you're talkin' about.

28:45.123 --> 28:47.287
I think you do.

28:49.492 --> 28:51.178
Maybe this shit works
for some people,

28:51.266 --> 28:54.030
but not me...
you know?

28:56.076 --> 28:58.436
Maybe some people just are
who they fuckin' are, you know?

28:58.524 --> 29:00.108
They don't change.

29:01.170 --> 29:04.123
Are you talking
about your father or you?

29:08.543 --> 29:09.958
I gotta go.

29:10.123 --> 29:12.092
The hour's not over.

29:12.180 --> 29:14.182
Yeah, it is.

29:42.426 --> 29:43.571
Hey, Stu.

29:43.659 --> 29:46.658
He's not exactly taking
to the talking cure, Ray.

29:46.754 --> 29:48.244
<i>He's threatening
to break her leg, Ray,</i>

29:48.331 --> 29:50.178
<i>fucking Nancy Kerrigan style.</i>

29:50.266 --> 29:54.508
And when that happens,
I'm fucked.

29:54.821 --> 29:56.072
<i>You're fucked.
We're all fucked, Ray.</i>

29:56.159 --> 29:57.587
- I'll talk to him.
- <i>Talk to him?</i>

29:57.675 --> 29:59.340
<i>I don't need you
to talk to him, Ray.</i>

29:59.428 --> 30:01.173
<i>I need you to break
his kneecaps!</i>

30:01.261 --> 30:02.876
<i>I need you to send a message</i>

30:02.964 --> 30:04.611
<i>that he's not going to ever
fucking go near her again!</i>

30:04.698 --> 30:05.673
You have a minute?

30:05.761 --> 30:08.837
<i>Ever, at all.
That's what I need, Ray...</i>

30:12.485 --> 30:13.837
Can you tell me
where you were

30:13.925 --> 30:15.603
on the night
of November seventh?

30:16.336 --> 30:17.907
November seventh?

30:18.600 --> 30:19.885
Know what day of the week
that was?

30:19.972 --> 30:21.228
Saturday.

30:21.373 --> 30:22.884
Saturday.

30:24.125 --> 30:25.108
Ah, Satur...

30:25.196 --> 30:27.556
I‐I took my, uh,
daughter and her husband

30:27.644 --> 30:28.850
to a concert.

30:29.250 --> 30:30.793
Jonathan Walker Hanson.

30:32.699 --> 30:34.751
Jonathan Walker Hanson?

30:35.711 --> 30:37.939
Yeah, my daughter's
a big fan.

30:38.097 --> 30:39.579
You got proof
you were there?

30:39.667 --> 30:40.897
I'm sure she's got some stubs

30:40.984 --> 30:42.439
in a scrapbook or something.

30:42.527 --> 30:44.507
‐ I'd like to see them.
‐ Sure.

30:44.595 --> 30:46.243
I'll ask her.

30:50.573 --> 30:52.181
Your son‐in‐law's name?

30:52.269 --> 30:53.532
Jakob Smith.

30:53.747 --> 30:55.368
Thank you,
Mr. Donovan.

31:18.845 --> 31:20.751
Did you tell her
about the concert?

31:22.266 --> 31:24.055
How'd it go
with Kevin Sullivan?

31:25.243 --> 31:27.626
He's trying to buy time.

31:28.326 --> 31:30.017
All right.
This is for Amber.

31:30.223 --> 31:32.353
I need you to go
to Staten Island,

31:32.705 --> 31:35.329
West Shore Motel, see if
they have security cameras.

31:35.542 --> 31:36.884
Have you been drinking?

31:36.972 --> 31:38.181
Yeah.

31:50.802 --> 31:52.290
Do you need a hand?

31:52.657 --> 31:54.915
Yeah, a‐actually, yeah.

31:55.018 --> 31:57.079
- Could you hold this for me, please?
- Yeah, sure.

32:01.391 --> 32:03.415
Wow.
I'm so sorry.

32:05.131 --> 32:07.650
Yeah, it's my...
my dad.

32:08.110 --> 32:09.739
He died yesterday.

32:09.867 --> 32:13.590
‐ So very sorry.
‐ It's okay.

32:15.035 --> 32:16.410
I'm Daryll.

32:16.566 --> 32:17.770
Jasmine.

32:17.865 --> 32:19.447
Nice to meet you.

32:19.583 --> 32:22.373
I, uh...
I dropped my mail by you...

32:22.461 --> 32:23.667
I remember.

32:23.986 --> 32:25.278
‐ Yeah.
‐ Well, look, let me know

32:25.366 --> 32:27.704
if there's anything
that you need, okay?

32:28.320 --> 32:30.017
I'm right down here in 2A.

32:30.422 --> 32:32.056
‐ 2A, huh?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

32:32.159 --> 32:33.579
‐ Thanks.
‐ Yeah.

33:07.703 --> 33:09.626
Hey, kid.
Your mom home?

33:09.714 --> 33:10.821
Mom!

33:11.134 --> 33:13.399
‐ Mom, Ray's here.
‐

33:14.222 --> 33:15.636
Brady, you gotta go.

33:15.793 --> 33:17.641
- Mom!
- It's okay.

33:17.878 --> 33:20.047
Jimmy, wash your hands.

33:28.658 --> 33:30.993
We should talk about
what you're gonna say.

33:31.962 --> 33:33.813
Mac was in
over his head.

33:34.857 --> 33:37.610
Rad was stealing guns
from evidence and selling 'em.

33:38.286 --> 33:40.368
Started lifting drugs, too.

33:40.925 --> 33:42.927
Mac drew the line.

33:43.449 --> 33:44.992
Say it back.

33:53.433 --> 33:56.187
Mac and Rad were selling
guns outta evidence.

33:56.275 --> 33:57.749
Uh...

33:58.171 --> 34:01.258
Rad started stealing drugs.
Mac wouldn't go along.

34:02.178 --> 34:04.510
After Rad threatened
you and Jimmy,

34:05.168 --> 34:07.632
Mac finally decided
to do something about it.

34:08.663 --> 34:10.206
You never saw him again.

34:12.879 --> 34:14.592
Jimmy, your sandwich is ready!

34:15.010 --> 34:16.841
Okay.

34:26.570 --> 34:27.984
This is for you.

34:29.110 --> 34:31.487
Don't put that there.

34:52.188 --> 34:54.021
You all right?

34:59.034 --> 35:01.866
You know, your dad...

35:01.953 --> 35:03.455
he was a good guy.

35:07.083 --> 35:09.252
He loved you.

35:09.884 --> 35:11.591
He told me that,
you know?

35:12.397 --> 35:13.770
All right.

35:14.747 --> 35:16.765
Just wanted you to know.

35:51.805 --> 35:53.428
What the fuck...

35:55.508 --> 35:56.881
Shit.

35:57.545 --> 36:00.795
God damn it.
This fuckin' shit!

36:14.419 --> 36:15.819
- Yeah.
- <i>The guy is</i>

36:15.907 --> 36:18.514
<i>following her now
to her apartment building!</i>

36:18.602 --> 36:20.428
‐ What?
<i>‐ You took the job,</i>

36:20.516 --> 36:21.686
<i>and I fuckin' paid you!</i>

36:21.774 --> 36:25.538
<i>Just do the fuckin' job
I fuckin' paid you to do!</i>

36:25.626 --> 36:27.378
Fuck off, Stu.

36:45.807 --> 36:47.097
Hi.

36:47.331 --> 36:49.366
My toilet's busted, room two...
‐ What?

36:49.728 --> 36:51.483
‐ My toilet's overflowing.

36:51.671 --> 36:53.600
Oh, shit.

36:54.130 --> 36:56.124
Listen, I'll just
give you a different room.

36:56.310 --> 36:58.772
Uh, well, look,
I‐I'm just above you,

36:58.860 --> 37:00.725
and I don't wanna tell you
how to do your job,

37:00.813 --> 37:02.600
but it's gonna flood out
the whole place.

37:16.737 --> 37:18.906
Thank you.

38:02.321 --> 38:03.222
Yeah.

38:03.310 --> 38:04.766
They found Big Al.

38:05.204 --> 38:07.036
<i>Someone dismembered
the body</i>

38:07.302 --> 38:09.456
and threw his head
into Long Island Sound.

38:09.892 --> 38:12.472
What kinda maniac
does that, do you think?

38:13.318 --> 38:14.699
I'm on it.

38:14.860 --> 38:16.858
<i>What about Sullivan, Ray?</i>

38:17.266 --> 38:18.894
<i>If I hold
a news conference,</i>

38:18.982 --> 38:20.825
it's not gonna be
about Big Al.

38:20.913 --> 38:22.399
It's gonna be
about breaking ground

38:22.487 --> 38:24.838
on the new children's hospital,
right?

38:25.125 --> 38:26.627
Yeah.

39:06.614 --> 39:08.990
Listen, man,
I don't want any...

39:12.537 --> 39:14.810
‐ Where is she?
‐ What the fuck?

39:20.155 --> 39:21.403
Stop it, stop it!

39:21.491 --> 39:23.618
What the fuck
are you doing?

39:25.175 --> 39:26.654
What did Stu tell you?

39:27.302 --> 39:28.740
He's not the problem.

39:28.913 --> 39:30.271
Stu is.

40:13.776 --> 40:14.898
Yeah.

40:14.986 --> 40:16.427
The tapes are scrubbed.

40:16.515 --> 40:17.677
<i>Okay.</i>

40:26.030 --> 40:27.396
Yeah?

40:27.499 --> 40:29.668
You need to make the call now.

40:34.461 --> 40:35.879
Amber?

40:41.932 --> 40:44.014
I can't make him into
a murderer.

40:44.765 --> 40:46.419
<i>I can't.</i>

40:46.796 --> 40:48.271
My kid's already
got it bad enough.

40:48.359 --> 40:50.271
I can't make it fuckin' worse.

40:52.095 --> 40:53.380
All right.

40:54.473 --> 40:56.123
Come get your money.

40:57.082 --> 40:58.498
Keep it.

41:13.501 --> 41:15.458
<i>He loved
my little Maria.</i>

41:16.224 --> 41:19.169
Yeah.
He loved her so fuckin' much.

41:19.856 --> 41:22.370
Yeah, he was a shit father
but...

41:23.130 --> 41:25.123
he was a good grandpa.

41:30.168 --> 41:31.457
Dad.

41:31.545 --> 41:33.543
‐ W‐where you been?
‐ Huh?

41:33.631 --> 41:35.544
You missed Bridget singin'.

41:36.305 --> 41:37.708
Sorry, sweetheart.

41:38.169 --> 41:40.162
Yeah, Ray, we're just
toastin' Mickey.

41:42.711 --> 41:43.791
Good.

41:44.229 --> 41:45.896
Dad, what are you doing?

41:49.400 --> 41:52.403
Pourin' a drink, sweetheart.
What are you doin'?

41:54.366 --> 41:56.113
We're telling stories
about Grandpa.

41:56.201 --> 41:57.591
Yeah?

41:58.163 --> 41:59.786
I got one of those.

42:00.046 --> 42:01.740
Hey, Terry,
you remember that time

42:01.828 --> 42:04.263
Mom pissed the bed
when I was sleepin' with her?

42:05.021 --> 42:06.071
Dad.

42:06.388 --> 42:08.154
No, it's a good one,
sweetheart.

42:08.263 --> 42:10.380
Don't think I ever
told you this before.

42:11.089 --> 42:13.175
I was about ten years old.

42:14.863 --> 42:17.583
Your grandma was in
so much fuckin' pain

42:17.671 --> 42:19.591
that she pissed the bed
while I was in it.

42:19.679 --> 42:20.537
Ray, come on.

42:20.625 --> 42:23.818
So I go down to the kitchen,
you know, to get a towel.

42:25.028 --> 42:28.419
Guess who I see with his hand
in Mom's fuckin' cookie jar?

42:30.233 --> 42:31.772
Tricky Mickey.

42:32.320 --> 42:34.277
Mom's upstairs dyin' of cancer,

42:34.863 --> 42:37.271
Mick comes over and steals
her life savings.

42:37.825 --> 42:40.240
We're trying to tell her
happy stories, Ray.

42:40.414 --> 42:41.749
Yeah?

42:42.595 --> 42:44.222
How's that goin' for ya?

42:51.821 --> 42:53.740
There was that time
he got outta Walpole

42:53.828 --> 42:55.544
and shot that fuckin' priest.

42:57.169 --> 42:59.779
- Wrong priest.
- Least he got one.

42:59.867 --> 43:01.532
I thought Ray shot the priest.

43:01.863 --> 43:03.361
Uh, different priest.

43:03.479 --> 43:04.938
I'm the only one
who didn't shoot a priest.

43:05.025 --> 43:06.826
You better get
yourself a fuckin' priest, Ter.

43:06.919 --> 43:08.879
Oh, my God.

43:13.745 --> 43:15.919
Ah... how 'bout...

43:16.059 --> 43:18.333
how 'bout the time Mick
and Einstein over here

43:18.421 --> 43:21.072
go out in that boat trying to...
trying to dump those body parts

43:21.160 --> 43:23.583
but don't even bother
to check the fuckin' tides?

43:25.646 --> 43:27.231
Ohh...

43:28.079 --> 43:30.790
Fuckin' fluke, fisherman starts
hooking heads, and, uh...

43:32.591 --> 43:34.771
and the cops are asking
questions, so...

43:35.771 --> 43:37.607
That's the problem with...

43:37.927 --> 43:39.607
stories with Mick,

43:39.721 --> 43:42.223
there's not
a lotta happy endings.

43:43.008 --> 43:44.568
Unless, of course,
he's gettin' one.

44:16.575 --> 44:18.200
To our father...

44:20.373 --> 44:22.122
Michael Donovan.

44:23.489 --> 44:25.700
May he rest in fuckin' peace.
