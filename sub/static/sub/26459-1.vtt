<i>Everything was just as it should be.</i>

00:51.217 --> 00:57.182

01:24.834 --> 01:27.504
Oh, Michelle, honey,
I had that all set for the call.

01:28.546 --> 01:30.965
Sorry, Mommy, just wanted
to hear it again.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.217
[chuckles] Oh, don't worry,

01:32.300 --> 01:34.344
you sound just as good today
as you did last night.

01:35.762 --> 01:37.806
Your voice reading those words

01:37.889 --> 01:40.850
is gonna be like the cherry on top
to charm those publishers.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.477
I have no doubt.

01:42.560 --> 01:43.394
Okay.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.939
I mean, you really like this one, right?

01:46.022 --> 01:49.317
Yeah. But where do you think
Mr. Poppins will go?

01:49.818 --> 01:52.278
Well, that's the best part.

01:52.362 --> 01:58.785
When this becomes a book series, well,
he can go wherever we want him to.

01:59.369 --> 02:01.287
The jungle, the beach.

02:01.371 --> 02:02.372
The moon?

02:02.455 --> 02:03.998
[laughing] Anywhere you want.

02:05.291 --> 02:07.293
Speaking of adventures, what happened?

02:07.752 --> 02:09.045
[Michelle] It was Bobby Whitlock.

02:09.129 --> 02:12.132
-Oh?
-He thumped me during recess.

02:12.966 --> 02:16.886
Oh, right. Well, maybe next time,
we don't play with Bobby Whitlock.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.763
What do you say, hmm?

02:18.847 --> 02:19.681
[kisses]

02:19.764 --> 02:20.765
Hmm?

02:22.642 --> 02:23.476
Oh!

02:24.435 --> 02:25.728
Don't forget your lunch.

02:28.106 --> 02:30.024
-No crusts?
-No crusts.

02:34.028 --> 02:35.071
What's wrong, sweetie?

02:36.156 --> 02:36.990
Nothing.

02:37.073 --> 02:38.658
[telephone ringing]

02:38.741 --> 02:42.996
Oh! That must be the, uh...
The book people.

02:43.079 --> 02:44.205
Hello?

02:46.207 --> 02:49.919
Oh, hi. Yeah, could you, um...
Could you just give me one minute?

02:50.003 --> 02:52.422
-Mom, I'm gonna be late.
-[whispers] One minute, honey.

02:52.505 --> 02:55.300
Um, yeah, I just have to get
my, uh, daughter out the door.

02:56.050 --> 02:58.052
No, no, no. All right, thank you.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.972
Okay, let's have one last look at you.

03:01.764 --> 03:02.599
Aw.

03:04.267 --> 03:05.101
[sighs]

03:05.185 --> 03:06.728
Beautiful as always.

03:12.108 --> 03:13.318
I love you, Mom.

03:14.110 --> 03:15.945
I love you, too, sweetie.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.030
[kisses]

03:18.489 --> 03:19.741
Have a good day.

03:21.451 --> 03:25.371
Hi. Yes. No. My, uh... My daughter
just had a bus to catch.

03:28.625 --> 03:29.918
Uh-huh.

03:33.296 --> 03:36.174
So you like it? Oh, that's wonderful.

03:36.257 --> 03:38.509
Mmm-hmm. Ah!

03:38.593 --> 03:40.220
[chuckles] Yes.

03:41.095 --> 03:45.725
Mr. Poppins and I
are more than ready for that.

-[man] What?
-[woman] Toothbrush.

04:18.424 --> 04:19.759
[man] I think I packed it.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.386
What?

04:22.053 --> 04:23.054
I packed it.

04:24.472 --> 04:25.598
I'm using yours, then.

04:26.140 --> 04:28.810
No, that's gross.
Throw it out when you're done.

04:29.519 --> 04:30.353
Ah...

04:34.148 --> 04:34.983
Mmm...

04:35.525 --> 04:37.568
No. I'm reading.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.030
Oh, you're reading, huh?

04:41.114 --> 04:43.032
-Yeah.
-Is that what you're doing?

04:43.408 --> 04:45.451
-Hmm?
-All right, I'm going to take a break.

04:50.957 --> 04:52.542
[chuckling softly]

04:58.339 --> 04:59.799
[man sighs]

05:02.510 --> 05:03.636
How are you feeling?

05:04.470 --> 05:05.555
Sleepy.

05:06.097 --> 05:08.308
Come on. About tomorrow.

05:09.058 --> 05:10.768
[sighs] I don't wanna talk about it.

05:11.519 --> 05:13.104
It's okay to be excited.

05:13.187 --> 05:14.939
[woman] I have to take my eyes out.

05:16.524 --> 05:17.775
It'll be great.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.194
That's what you keep saying.

05:24.198 --> 05:25.491
New job, new city...

05:29.996 --> 05:31.080
Town.

05:32.874 --> 05:33.875
[clears throat]

05:36.836 --> 05:41.174
It's a town, not a city.
New York is a city.

05:41.257 --> 05:43.760
This is small-town America.

05:43.843 --> 05:47.638
A small town, bigger house.

05:47.722 --> 05:49.140
Isn't that what you want?

05:49.223 --> 05:50.224
I do.

05:51.184 --> 05:54.854
I'm just nervous, and I'm excited...

05:54.937 --> 05:57.106
And... [sighs]

05:57.190 --> 05:58.191
What?

06:00.985 --> 06:03.863
And wishing
I did not have to start a new job

06:03.946 --> 06:06.366
two weeks before you can be out there.

06:06.949 --> 06:10.787
And wondering if you realize
what a big change this is gonna be.

06:11.412 --> 06:13.331
Michelle, we've got this.

06:14.123 --> 06:15.958
You're gonna love your job.

06:16.042 --> 06:18.669
I'm gonna love writing
the next great American novel.

06:19.003 --> 06:22.048
In just two weeks, we're gonna love
this new small-town life together.

06:22.131 --> 06:23.257
[sighs]

06:24.550 --> 06:27.303
Well, at least one of us is convinced.

07:25.361 --> 07:26.362
[exhales]

07:39.250 --> 07:41.169
[exhales deeply] Okay.

07:51.012 --> 07:52.847
[cell phone beeps]

08:23.669 --> 08:25.880
[cell phone beeps]

08:29.967 --> 08:31.093
[chuckles]

08:33.054 --> 08:35.389
Good night, Jonathan.

08:38.309 --> 08:39.268
[exhales]

08:42.772 --> 08:43.606
[door opens]

08:45.024 --> 08:47.109
Sorry to just throw you
right into the fire like this.

08:47.193 --> 08:50.196
We normally have a whole orientation
and training period

08:50.279 --> 08:52.823
with meetings and assessments
and, you know, all that.

08:52.907 --> 08:55.743
But you usually aren't replacing someone
in the middle of the school year.

08:55.826 --> 08:59.330
Exactly. When Mr. Cochran left,
it really put us in a tight spot.

09:00.414 --> 09:04.168
That's Ashley. She's down here
with the K through second kids.

09:04.252 --> 09:06.754
They stay pretty busy,
so I wouldn't expect to hear much

09:06.837 --> 09:10.383
-from her during the day.
-All right, kids. Carpet, now.

09:10.466 --> 09:11.509
Come on, over here.

09:13.302 --> 09:15.846
Your office is up here on the left.

09:15.930 --> 09:20.351
It's a mess, but it's your mess now,
so make yourself at home.

09:20.434 --> 09:22.478
I got another thing in five minutes,

09:22.562 --> 09:27.108
so, uh, if you need anything,
any help, just yell.

09:27.191 --> 09:29.318
[chuckles] Someone might actually respond.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.817
[keyboard clacking]

10:42.266 --> 10:45.019
Hi, you must be the new EEPM.

10:45.102 --> 10:46.145
EEPM?

10:46.687 --> 10:48.522
Early Education Program Manager.

10:48.606 --> 10:52.276
Oh, yeah. I guess that's me.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.195
And you're our teacher?

10:54.278 --> 10:55.988
Ashley. At your service.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.073
Michelle.

10:57.698 --> 10:59.158
[Ashley] Sorry, it's nap time,

10:59.241 --> 11:01.744
and I'm not supposed
to let them out of my sight.

11:01.827 --> 11:03.287
But the office phone's broken,

11:03.371 --> 11:06.415
so I figured, message by shoe
was my next best option.

11:06.499 --> 11:07.625
[chuckles]

11:07.708 --> 11:10.336
Shh. My break lasts as long as they sleep.

11:10.419 --> 11:12.755
-Sorry.
-Yeah. Here.

11:12.838 --> 11:16.133
Call yourself and then I can leave
my shoe on next time.

11:18.010 --> 11:21.639
So, I'm guessing a broken office phone
isn't the only issue around here?

11:22.973 --> 11:25.601
Cochran left us a pretty solid mess.

11:25.685 --> 11:29.063
He was more of
the "if it's broke, don't fix it" type.

11:29.146 --> 11:31.148
-Well, I'm here to help.
-Great.

11:31.232 --> 11:32.650
'Cause I have a wish list.

11:32.733 --> 11:36.529
New teaching materials,
toys that aren't broken, updated books.

11:36.612 --> 11:39.740
-Sounds like we need the works.
-[door opening and closing]

11:40.908 --> 11:42.910
Oh, early. Of course.

11:42.993 --> 11:46.706
-Who's that?
-[all] Ms. Cathy!

11:48.040 --> 11:50.543
Ms. Cathy Rhodes. Local celebrity.

11:51.043 --> 11:52.211
What does she do?

11:52.294 --> 11:54.922
She writes the <i>Mr. Poppins</i> book series.

11:55.005 --> 11:58.050
Kids love her,
but she runs on her own schedule.

11:58.134 --> 12:01.971
And that schedule means
break time's over for me. We'll catch up.

12:02.054 --> 12:03.639
We have the whole school year
ahead of us.

12:04.056 --> 12:04.932
Sounds good.

12:06.934 --> 12:10.146
All right, kids. It looks like
we have a special guest today.

12:10.229 --> 12:14.233
Let's gather around and see
what Ms. Cathy has to share with us.

12:14.358 --> 12:19.530
<i>Mr. Poppins:</i>
<i>A Hoppy Trail Around The World.</i>

12:24.869 --> 12:28.664
"Once upon a time,
there lived a bunny, Mr. Poppins.

12:28.748 --> 12:32.376
And Mr. Poppins loved
to travel the world."

12:41.260 --> 12:42.178
Hello there.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.138
Oh, hi.

12:44.221 --> 12:45.306
I'm Cathy.

12:45.389 --> 12:46.974
Uh, so I hear.

12:47.641 --> 12:50.895
Oh, well, I take it, they warned you
about the eccentric old writer

12:50.978 --> 12:53.731
who comes by every now and again
to read to the children.

12:53.814 --> 12:55.858
They did not mention "eccentric."

12:56.442 --> 12:58.360
Oh, well, that's very kind of them.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.405
I'm sorry, but I didn't get your name.

13:01.489 --> 13:04.241
Oh, uh, Michelle. The new EEPM.

13:05.993 --> 13:08.204
Michelle. That's... It's a beautiful name.

13:09.663 --> 13:12.333
Uh, yeah. I kinda like it. [chuckles]

13:12.416 --> 13:16.504
And you are our new program manager.
Well, that is delightful.

13:16.587 --> 13:19.673
[sighs] Delightful, overwhelming.

13:20.341 --> 13:23.344
[sighs] Sounds like we'll be
seeing a lot of each other.

13:23.719 --> 13:24.845
I'm sure we will.

13:25.596 --> 13:28.641
I try to come by here
as often as they will let me.

13:28.766 --> 13:31.977
Well, that's great.
It was really nice meeting you.

13:32.061 --> 13:33.646
[Cathy] Oh, a real pleasure.

13:36.023 --> 13:41.320
Uh, you know, uh, reading isn't
the only way I can help these children.

13:42.071 --> 13:46.450
Um, although, no one's been
particularly receptive to my ideas.

13:46.534 --> 13:49.578
But perhaps, we could do a tea
and discuss.

13:49.703 --> 13:51.705
Yeah, I would love that sometime.

13:52.373 --> 13:54.708
Oh, wonderful. Well, we could take my car.

13:54.792 --> 13:55.626
Uh...

13:55.709 --> 13:57.711
Oh, uh, wait, you mean now?

13:57.795 --> 14:01.215
Well, I prefer not to put off
what could be done right away.

14:01.298 --> 14:03.467
Uh, it's just, I'm still getting set up

14:03.551 --> 14:07.096
and the movers will come,
I'm not sure when.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.222
I understand.

14:08.305 --> 14:10.057
I, and I, um...

14:10.891 --> 14:14.895
[chuckles] I just know how quickly
someone in your position gets too busy

14:14.979 --> 14:16.856
for a kooky old lady like me,

14:16.939 --> 14:18.899
and, uh, it won't be the first time.

14:20.943 --> 14:22.862
Uh, no, no. You know what?

14:22.945 --> 14:26.615
There's no way the movers
would make it here that quickly.

14:26.699 --> 14:27.950
I got some time.

14:29.910 --> 14:31.745
[chuckles] That's wonderful.

14:31.829 --> 14:33.247
[Michelle chuckles]

14:33.330 --> 14:34.331
All right.

14:38.085 --> 14:41.130
[Cathy] So, tell me, what do you think?

14:41.213 --> 14:45.259
Have you ever been
to a more beautiful place?

14:45.342 --> 14:50.347
Well, I grew up in the city, so, no.
And that was kind of the whole point.

14:50.431 --> 14:53.601
I've always wanted to try
the small town thing.

14:53.684 --> 14:54.768
It's just...

14:57.229 --> 14:58.772
It's just...?

14:58.856 --> 15:02.151
No, it's just, you sort of have
this idea of things in your head,

15:02.234 --> 15:05.779
but then you get there,
and suddenly, the school has no money,

15:05.863 --> 15:09.867
the books are from the '70s,
and the toys...

15:09.950 --> 15:12.661
may or may not have been recalled
a decade ago.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.705
Well, this brings me to my point.

15:14.788 --> 15:16.874
I know you're new,
but we're all family here.

15:16.957 --> 15:19.919
And so if you need something,
you simply ask.

15:20.002 --> 15:22.087
So what is it that the kids
need the most?

15:23.213 --> 15:27.343
Well, Jonathan would be disappointed
if I did not say books.

15:27.885 --> 15:29.053
Jonathan?

15:29.136 --> 15:32.306
My fiancé. He's a writer, too, actually.

15:32.389 --> 15:34.183
Just not as successful as you.

15:34.266 --> 15:38.479
[chuckles] A fiancé who's a writer
and loves books?

15:38.562 --> 15:40.272
Oh, that is perfect.

15:40.356 --> 15:43.359
It is. Uh, he's still finishing up
some work in the city,

15:43.442 --> 15:47.404
so the jury's out on whether this life
will even work out for him.

15:48.489 --> 15:49.740
Why wouldn't it?

15:49.823 --> 15:53.661
It's my dream that he's going along with.

15:54.244 --> 15:56.538
I just don't wanna be a resentment.

15:56.622 --> 15:59.875
Oh, sweetheart, if you're a resentment,
then he's not the right man for you.

16:00.250 --> 16:02.044
[chuckles] Fair.

16:04.838 --> 16:06.715
You haven't even touched your tea.

16:07.383 --> 16:08.342
Waitress.

16:09.677 --> 16:10.844
A bottle of Chardonnay.

16:12.304 --> 16:13.305
[chuckles]

16:13.931 --> 16:15.975
It is so wonderful to have you here.

16:16.058 --> 16:18.894
You're just what the school
and this town needs.

16:21.188 --> 16:24.066
It really feels like it could become home.

16:24.191 --> 16:27.194
Mmm. Wow. Oh, dear,
if you keep talking like that,

16:27.277 --> 16:29.530
you're gonna make
your real family jealous.

16:30.948 --> 16:32.825
I don't think that will be an issue.

16:33.701 --> 16:34.827
[Cathy] No?

16:36.036 --> 16:39.289
Real family is something
I've never really had.

16:40.124 --> 16:41.834
What would you say you had?

16:42.501 --> 16:45.754
A bunch of false starts.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.008
How do you have a false start
with a family?

16:49.842 --> 16:50.926
Were you adopted?

16:51.677 --> 16:53.595
More like passed around.

16:54.304 --> 16:57.850
Uh, my mother,
she tried to take care of me,

16:57.933 --> 17:02.980
but eventually, the state got involved,
then took me away.

17:04.148 --> 17:07.484
At least, that's what they told me.
I don't remember anything.

17:09.945 --> 17:13.323
Well, for one so young, I doubt you would.

17:15.451 --> 17:16.994
But it doesn't matter.

17:17.077 --> 17:18.287
It's run its course,

17:18.370 --> 17:23.292
and now I have Jonathan
and a real chance at a normal life.

17:24.376 --> 17:26.170
The past can only change you
if you let it.

17:28.005 --> 17:29.882
How old are you, sweetheart?

17:30.299 --> 17:33.052
Uh, 27. Why?

17:35.888 --> 17:36.930
You're just...

17:38.098 --> 17:39.975
You're so wise for your age.

17:44.563 --> 17:47.941
[young Michelle] <i>So, he packed a knapsack</i>
<i>with everything it would fit</i>

17:48.025 --> 17:50.611
<i>and he left this place</i>
<i>that was so familiar</i>

17:50.694 --> 17:53.155
<i>to begin an adventure into the unknown.</i>

17:55.991 --> 17:59.578
Thank you so much for everything.

17:59.661 --> 18:02.289
I finally feel like
this may actually work out.

18:02.372 --> 18:04.208
Well, again, it was my pleasure.

18:06.710 --> 18:08.128
Do you like casserole?

18:08.754 --> 18:10.464
Uh, sorry. It's just, it's...

18:10.547 --> 18:14.843
It's casserole night tomorrow at my house,
and I was wondering what do you think

18:14.927 --> 18:17.888
of having dinner with me and my husband?

18:17.971 --> 18:20.224
Uh, casserole.

18:20.307 --> 18:21.391
Uh, you know...

18:21.475 --> 18:23.477
Yeah, sure. Count me in.

18:24.478 --> 18:25.646
It's a date, then.

18:32.611 --> 18:34.238
[car engine starts]

19:04.643 --> 19:05.853
[sighs]

19:21.368 --> 19:23.579
I don't know
what these kids do in their sleep,

19:23.662 --> 19:25.622
but this is the second one this week.

19:26.206 --> 19:28.667
Great, I'll throw blankets
on the list of stuff

19:28.750 --> 19:30.294
we need to magically find money for.

19:31.962 --> 19:33.964
Things don't look so promising, do they?

19:34.590 --> 19:37.301
[sighs] No, I think they are.

19:37.384 --> 19:39.261
The budget is just such a mess,

19:39.344 --> 19:43.265
and it's gonna take me weeks to figure out
where all our funds are actually going.

19:43.348 --> 19:45.392
Oh, weeks, I can live with.

19:48.770 --> 19:50.564
Do you wanna grab a beer?

19:51.690 --> 19:53.567
You'd have better luck offering wine.

19:53.650 --> 19:56.236
Well, lucky for you,
the bar here serves both.

19:56.904 --> 19:58.864
Ugh, I could use it.

19:58.947 --> 20:00.908
But the movers came yesterday
and I missed them,

20:00.991 --> 20:02.910
so I gotta be around
when they come back tonight.

20:03.493 --> 20:05.287
I kinda need my iron.

20:05.370 --> 20:06.747
[Ashley] Yeah. Good call.

20:07.789 --> 20:10.584
Plus, I already have dinner plans
I need to cancel anyways.

20:10.667 --> 20:14.338
Oh, well, if you're canceling,
then why don't we make new ones?

20:14.713 --> 20:19.843
I can grab a pizza, some drinks,
eat at your place, help you unpack?

20:21.011 --> 20:23.639
Sounds good to me,
but what's in it for you?

20:23.722 --> 20:26.683
This is a small town.
It's how we welcome people.

20:26.767 --> 20:28.727
[answering machine beeps]

20:28.810 --> 20:32.439
[Michelle]<i> Hi, Mrs. Rhodes,</i>
<i>um, Cathy. It's Michelle.</i>

20:32.522 --> 20:36.193
<i>Thank you so much</i>
<i>for inviting me over tonight.</i>

20:36.276 --> 20:40.822
<i>But the movers came today</i>
<i>and I don't think I'll be able to make it.</i>

20:40.906 --> 20:42.699
<i>Let's try again a different night.</i>

20:42.783 --> 20:46.286
<i>You're so sweet to invite me</i>
<i>and I'm really looking forward to it.</i>

20:46.370 --> 20:49.248
<i>Let me know when you're free.</i>
<i>All right, thanks. Bye.</i>

20:49.790 --> 20:51.083
[dishes shatter]

20:56.505 --> 20:57.756
Ooh. [chuckles]

20:57.839 --> 20:59.716
To your new life in the sticks.

21:14.523 --> 21:17.693
So wait, you got drunk with Cathy Rhodes?

21:17.776 --> 21:19.486
I did not say "drunk."

21:19.569 --> 21:21.863
-[laughs]
-We had some wine.

21:21.947 --> 21:23.323
She was really sweet.

21:23.407 --> 21:26.451
Okay, fine. But Cathy Rhodes?

21:26.535 --> 21:28.662
And she asked you
to come over for dinner?

21:29.246 --> 21:31.164
Why is this such a big deal?

21:31.248 --> 21:32.332
I don't know.

21:32.416 --> 21:36.920
She kinda keeps to herself,
except for story time, of course.

21:37.921 --> 21:38.964
Really?

21:40.048 --> 21:42.134
She did not seem like that at all.

21:43.427 --> 21:45.679
Oh! You don't know.

21:46.805 --> 21:49.516
What would I know?
I've been here two days.

21:50.392 --> 21:54.229
About the books...
Why she spends all her time with kids.

21:55.939 --> 21:58.775
'Cause she could never have kids
of her own?

21:59.609 --> 22:02.154
[Ashley] <i>Oh, no. She had a kid.</i>

22:02.863 --> 22:04.197
<i>A daughter.</i>

22:04.865 --> 22:07.284
[whispers] And she went missing
20 years ago.

22:10.996 --> 22:12.039
[Michelle] <i>Missing?</i>

22:13.081 --> 22:15.000
I... had no idea.

22:15.542 --> 22:17.627
[Ashley] Yeah, it was one
of the worst things<i> </i>

22:17.711 --> 22:20.672
<i>that happened around here.</i>
<i>Everyone still talks about it.</i>

22:21.673 --> 22:24.885
And now she has over
a hundred children's books

22:24.968 --> 22:26.595
about a wandering bunny.

22:27.262 --> 22:28.680
[Michelle] Mr. Poppins.

22:28.764 --> 22:32.642
Mr. Poppins. Travels the world, but...

22:32.726 --> 22:35.937
You know the one place
Mr. Poppins never quite makes it?

22:36.021 --> 22:37.105
Home.

22:38.857 --> 22:42.486
I'm just saying that her
and her husband, well...

22:43.695 --> 22:45.489
They're a bit off.

22:53.872 --> 22:56.375
[indistinct chattering]

22:57.501 --> 22:59.294
[laughing]

23:10.138 --> 23:11.807
[sighs] Thank you so much.

23:11.890 --> 23:14.976
This would've sucked alone.
We made a pretty good dent.

23:15.560 --> 23:17.521
I got your back anytime.

23:17.979 --> 23:21.191
I'm just so excited.
I actually get to sleep on a bed tonight.

23:21.274 --> 23:24.820
Yeah. Okay.
I guess we're officially friends now.

23:25.654 --> 23:27.697
Yep. Just don't use it against me at work.

23:27.781 --> 23:28.865
Mmm, no promises.

23:28.949 --> 23:29.991
[laughs]

23:30.367 --> 23:31.827
-Good night.
-Night.

23:34.830 --> 23:36.498
[cell phone beeps]

23:39.084 --> 23:41.420
What the... [sighs]

23:45.132 --> 23:46.299
[sighs]

23:47.926 --> 23:50.512
[Michelle] Hey, sorry.
Just thought I'd try you again.

23:51.054 --> 23:52.973
I think there's something off
with my cell service

23:53.056 --> 23:54.641
because I'm not getting your calls.

23:54.724 --> 23:56.643
And then they all just dump at once.

23:57.352 --> 23:59.062
Anyhow, I'll figure it out.

23:59.688 --> 24:01.606
I just want to hear your voice soon.

24:01.690 --> 24:03.775
Miss you. Love you.

24:03.859 --> 24:05.026
Bye.

24:13.368 --> 24:14.619
Excuse me?

24:16.413 --> 24:17.497
Uh, sorry.

24:18.540 --> 24:20.959
Uh, I was just dropping off
some books for the kids.

24:22.294 --> 24:25.172
I'm, uh... I'm Derek.
I'm... I'm Cathy's husband.

24:25.755 --> 24:27.799
Oh. Uh, hi.

24:27.883 --> 24:28.717
Hi.

24:28.800 --> 24:31.219
Uh, nice to meet you. Michelle.

24:33.346 --> 24:35.307
Uh, so those books are for us?

24:35.557 --> 24:37.267
Yeah, uh, they're Cathy's idea.

24:37.350 --> 24:39.186
She mentioned
that you needed some new books,

24:39.269 --> 24:42.856
so I agreed to do the heavy lifting
and take all the credit.

24:42.939 --> 24:44.691
[chuckles] Oh, awesome.

24:44.774 --> 24:46.526
[chuckles] Uh, no, really. I'm just...

24:47.068 --> 24:48.737
Just trying to be a good husband.

24:48.820 --> 24:51.865
-All right, let me help you with these.
-No, no. Whoa! Oops.

24:51.948 --> 24:53.617
[chuckles] Sorry, that was me.

24:53.700 --> 24:55.160
No worries.

24:56.286 --> 25:01.166
I thought, uh, I'd have
a chance to meet you earlier.

25:01.249 --> 25:02.542
But, you know...

25:02.626 --> 25:05.212
You missed out on one of
the best casseroles you'll ever have.

25:05.295 --> 25:06.379
I'm so sorry about that.

25:06.463 --> 25:09.299
No, no, no. I'm sorry.
No need to apologize.

25:09.382 --> 25:11.092
The movers came, and I just--

25:11.176 --> 25:13.512
I get it. You were busy.

25:13.595 --> 25:15.388
People get busy. It's all right.

25:16.139 --> 25:17.390
It's what people do.

25:18.475 --> 25:21.811
-Cathy wasn't upset, was she?
-No, no. Not at all. She understands.

25:21.895 --> 25:23.939
[Michelle] Very good. All right.

25:24.022 --> 25:26.107
-Well, this way. Thank you.
-[Derek] Okay.

25:28.693 --> 25:31.238
Thanks. Of course, it's funny, you know?

25:31.321 --> 25:32.572
What's that?

25:32.656 --> 25:35.909
Well, Cathy was just
so nervous the other night.

25:36.409 --> 25:38.495
You know, "What if Michelle's
a vegetarian?

25:38.578 --> 25:40.830
What if... What if she's allergic
to zucchini?

25:40.914 --> 25:43.500
What if she's a vegetarian
who's allergic to zucchini?"

25:43.583 --> 25:44.918
[chuckling] I mean,

25:45.001 --> 25:47.879
you wouldn't believe how this woman
could work herself up.

25:49.047 --> 25:50.423
Uh, where do you want these?

25:50.840 --> 25:51.883
There is fine.

25:54.135 --> 25:57.722
Well, um, I guess
we'll just have to reschedule.

25:57.806 --> 26:00.058
We will. Yeah.

26:00.141 --> 26:01.810
I'll just go get the last box.

26:01.893 --> 26:02.936
-Yeah.
-Okay.

26:03.019 --> 26:04.229
[chuckles]

26:08.692 --> 26:10.151
What was that about?

26:10.485 --> 26:12.529
Looks like we got a new library.

26:12.862 --> 26:14.573
[gasps]

26:14.656 --> 26:17.033
[Cathy] <i>"And Mr. Poppins</i>
<i>looked on either side of him.</i>

26:17.492 --> 26:19.703
Buildings as high as clouds.

26:19.786 --> 26:22.664
People clumped up and moving as one.

26:22.747 --> 26:26.376
The city was alive and he could feel it.

26:30.171 --> 26:31.923
And he took that with him.

26:32.924 --> 26:36.803
And took the new friendships he made
and the interesting people he met.

26:36.886 --> 26:40.599
And he smiled and he tipped his hat,
and he hopped along

26:40.682 --> 26:43.393
to what new adventure
tomorrow would bring.

26:46.855 --> 26:49.190
-The end."
-[clapping]

26:52.360 --> 26:54.237
-[kids cheering]
-[laughs]

26:57.949 --> 27:00.493
Mr. Poppins really makes it everywhere,
doesn't he?

27:01.494 --> 27:03.913
It's such a great idea for the kids.

27:03.997 --> 27:05.832
Oh, you're too kind.

27:05.915 --> 27:08.501
I just try to imagine
where he's going to wander to next.

27:08.877 --> 27:12.213
Then I try to give him
the best experience there that I can.

27:12.297 --> 27:14.424
I want him to be happy
wherever he goes.

27:15.675 --> 27:19.304
So, um, will he ever make it home?

27:20.013 --> 27:22.641
Well, that's the question, isn't it?

27:22.724 --> 27:24.017
Perhaps.

27:24.517 --> 27:27.479
I guess I'm just waiting
for the right time.

27:28.688 --> 27:30.649
The grand finale.

27:30.732 --> 27:32.108
I'm looking forward to it.

27:32.734 --> 27:35.195
Cathy, the books you donated,

27:35.278 --> 27:36.613
they're perfect.

27:36.696 --> 27:38.448
I can't believe you did that.

27:38.531 --> 27:39.783
Well, anything to help.

27:40.742 --> 27:45.580
And I feel so bad about the other night.
I'd still love to come by sometime.

27:45.664 --> 27:48.541
Oh, honey,
you are welcome whenever you like.

27:48.625 --> 27:50.126
You just let me know when.

27:51.294 --> 27:52.587
How about tonight?

27:56.174 --> 27:57.676
So soon? Aren't you busy?

27:58.843 --> 28:01.054
Sorry, is that too soon? It's just,

28:01.137 --> 28:03.807
"Why put off
what can be done right away," right?

28:04.683 --> 28:07.018
[chuckles] Well, are you sure?

28:07.102 --> 28:08.269
For real this time.

28:08.978 --> 28:11.606
Well, then tonight it is, and, uh...

28:12.190 --> 28:15.276
Well, it's just gonna be wonderful.
You bring your appetite.

28:15.360 --> 28:16.403
I will.

28:23.034 --> 28:24.285
[car alarm beeps]

28:36.172 --> 28:37.549
Hello?

28:41.886 --> 28:44.848
-Oh, hey!
-Hey, what? How?

28:44.973 --> 28:47.684
-Hey, baby.
-Aw!

28:47.809 --> 28:50.979
Oh, my God. I missed you so much.

28:52.605 --> 28:54.357
[sighs] Our phones
have been such garbage,

28:54.441 --> 28:58.194
I thought, "Stuff it. You know what?
I'm gonna surprise you with me."

28:58.278 --> 29:01.406
Why didn't you say something?
It's like a four-hour drive.

29:01.990 --> 29:04.534
-Then it wouldn't be a surprise.
-Good point.

29:04.617 --> 29:08.204
Oh, I'm just so happy to see you. Oh!

29:09.622 --> 29:10.582
Oh.

29:10.665 --> 29:12.417
-Yeah.
-They're beautiful.

29:14.502 --> 29:15.503
Yeah.

29:16.963 --> 29:21.092
So, what would you say to dinner
at the finest restaurant in town

29:21.176 --> 29:22.719
to celebrate your first week?

29:22.802 --> 29:25.680
Of course, you're gonna have to tell me
where that is since I have no idea.

29:26.681 --> 29:27.807
What?

29:28.516 --> 29:31.102
I have plans tonight.

29:32.395 --> 29:34.063
Cancel them?

29:34.481 --> 29:37.692
I can't. I already canceled once.

29:39.235 --> 29:40.320
All right.

29:41.863 --> 29:43.448
Where are we going?

29:44.866 --> 29:46.409
[doorbell rings]

29:46.785 --> 29:47.869
[mouthing] Hi.

29:50.914 --> 29:53.458
Michelle, sweetheart. Oh, and your friend.

29:53.541 --> 29:55.668
Jonathan. Michelle's fiancé.

29:55.752 --> 29:57.962
Oh, of course, of course. Come on in.

29:59.297 --> 30:01.257
-What did you say? Jimmy?
-Jonathan.

30:01.341 --> 30:04.177
Ah. Yeah, well, come on in. Come on.

30:05.303 --> 30:07.180
I hope everyone likes lasagna.

30:07.263 --> 30:09.849
[Derek] Oh, honey,
you've outdone yourself once again.

30:09.933 --> 30:11.893
It looks delicious.

30:11.976 --> 30:13.895
Here. Let me get some for you.

30:13.978 --> 30:16.272
Right there. Oh.

30:17.398 --> 30:18.441
Here.

30:18.691 --> 30:19.692
[Jonathan] I...

30:19.818 --> 30:22.779
[Derek] Here we go.
What? Something wrong?

30:22.862 --> 30:24.447
Uh, no. It...

30:24.531 --> 30:27.867
Oh, shoot! Uh, Jonathan
is gluten intolerant.

30:28.785 --> 30:31.538
It's not... It's not gluten. It's lasagna.

30:31.955 --> 30:33.081
Yeah, but the, uh...

30:33.164 --> 30:36.376
The pasta, like, the noodles, it's...
It's made out of gluten.

30:36.459 --> 30:39.546
Oh. I've, uh...
I've never heard about that. Huh.

30:40.046 --> 30:41.422
Uh, I could make something else.

30:41.506 --> 30:43.049
Uh, you know what? I'll eat around it.

30:43.132 --> 30:45.718
No, no, it's okay. If you're, you know...

30:46.594 --> 30:48.304
allergic to pasta, then, uh...

30:48.972 --> 30:51.140
I don't know, we got, like,
steak in the fridge maybe?

30:51.224 --> 30:53.351
Really, I... I don't wanna put you
through the trouble.

30:53.434 --> 30:55.770
No, no, no, that's fine, um...

30:55.854 --> 30:58.147
You're not allergic to steak, are you?

30:59.232 --> 31:00.817
[chuckles nervously]

31:06.114 --> 31:07.740
-[Derek] Huh?
-Yeah.

31:07.824 --> 31:10.618
[Derek] I see we finally got
the appetite out of this guy.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.579
I certainly have one of those.

31:12.662 --> 31:15.915
You know, maybe next time you can cook us
one of your gluten-free meals

31:15.999 --> 31:19.669
and we can get an idea
of what you, uh, actually eat.

31:22.046 --> 31:23.089
What?

31:23.172 --> 31:25.174
Uh, Jonathan doesn't really cook.

31:25.466 --> 31:28.052
What type of person doesn't cook?

31:28.136 --> 31:30.722
[laughing] The type of person that would

31:30.805 --> 31:32.807
probably burn down the kitchen
if he tried.

31:33.266 --> 31:35.518
[chuckles] Well, you're...

31:35.602 --> 31:37.937
You're probably at work
most of the time, anyway.

31:38.021 --> 31:41.232
Actually, work would be pretty much
from home now.

31:41.316 --> 31:43.526
Jonathan is a writer, too.

31:43.610 --> 31:46.613
Oh, that's right. You told me that.

31:46.696 --> 31:49.908
He's gonna take some time off
and work on his novel.

31:50.033 --> 31:52.035
He's really talented.

31:52.118 --> 31:55.705
So you're gonna, you know,
stay at home, writing...

31:56.497 --> 32:01.336
But you won't find any time
to make your lovely fiancée a meal?

32:01.920 --> 32:05.715
[chuckles]
That is the miracle of take-out.

32:06.215 --> 32:09.594
[chuckles] Which you'll probably buy
with the money that she's earning.

32:09.677 --> 32:11.721
He got an advance, actually.

32:12.764 --> 32:14.724
We're really excited to be coming here.

32:15.433 --> 32:16.517
[Derek] What's it about?

32:16.935 --> 32:18.770
Your little story.

32:19.270 --> 32:21.105
It's more on the sci-fi side of things.

32:21.189 --> 32:23.149
It's, uh... It's based in the future,

32:23.232 --> 32:25.151
when people can transfer
their consciousness

32:25.234 --> 32:27.737
to a new younger body
at the end of their lives.

32:27.820 --> 32:30.239
So, you know,
essentially they can live forever.

32:30.323 --> 32:33.242
But people have to battle
with whether they wanna do that

32:33.326 --> 32:35.662
when the people they know
who, maybe, can't afford it

32:35.745 --> 32:37.497
are gonna start dying off.

32:38.247 --> 32:39.666
It's a real morality tale.

32:39.749 --> 32:44.170
Wow. That's so interesting.
So it's about loss.

32:44.420 --> 32:47.465
Choosing whether
you're able to live with that

32:47.548 --> 32:50.593
or moving on to whatever comes next.

32:50.677 --> 32:51.761
Yeah, I guess so.

32:51.886 --> 32:54.055
Sounds like a personal topic.

32:54.722 --> 32:56.265
Yeah. I guess.

32:57.183 --> 33:00.311
But also, sci-fi's real hot right now,
so it'll sell.

33:00.395 --> 33:02.772
I'm just hoping the fresh air,
open spaces,

33:02.855 --> 33:04.983
you know, would be good
for the creative brain.

33:05.066 --> 33:06.567
It has been for Cathy,

33:06.651 --> 33:09.529
she's published almost
a hundred children's stories.

33:09.779 --> 33:10.697
Wow. Really?

33:10.780 --> 33:14.283
[chuckles] Sweetheart,
you don't have to mention that.

33:14.367 --> 33:18.579
No, that's amazing. There's a great market
for inspiring kids' dreams.

33:18.663 --> 33:20.123
Well, I suppose so,

33:20.206 --> 33:26.546
but I also think that a serious writer
starts by shaping their own.

33:27.380 --> 33:31.634
Taking the... the greatest trials
of their life and expressing them.

33:32.635 --> 33:34.762
Yeah, I guess that's
what we're in the business of.

33:34.846 --> 33:38.433
[laughing] Perhaps that's your issue,
young man.

33:38.516 --> 33:41.728
You know, it's not a business,
it is an art.

33:41.811 --> 33:44.814
You have to feel, not just think,
and you have to live it.

33:47.483 --> 33:51.154
Yeah, sure, yeah, you feel, but you also
have to support your art, too.

33:51.237 --> 33:54.282
I mean, it's easier to say
it's all about the art

33:54.365 --> 33:57.035
when you've already published
a hundred books for little kids.

33:59.996 --> 34:02.707
Well, maybe you don't know
the suffering one has to experience

34:02.790 --> 34:05.334
to express 100 books of material.

34:05.418 --> 34:09.255
Well, come on now.
Let's not get too serious.

34:12.216 --> 34:16.387
Well, it's...
It's all relative, isn't it, really?

34:16.471 --> 34:19.599
Um, you know, maybe we should
get together sometime.

34:19.682 --> 34:21.225
Hmm, we can discuss Proust.

34:21.309 --> 34:24.437
Oh, Proust.
No one talks about Proust anymore.

34:25.229 --> 34:26.939
No one even reads Proust.

34:28.649 --> 34:29.984
That's a shame.

34:30.735 --> 34:33.321
Michelle, you wanna give me
a hand, sweetheart?

34:33.404 --> 34:34.655
[Michelle] Yes.

34:49.378 --> 34:53.299
[Michelle] I'm sorry.
He had a long drive today.

34:54.217 --> 34:55.218
[sighs]

34:55.301 --> 34:59.055
Thank you so much for having both of us.
He really surprised me.

34:59.138 --> 35:02.100
[chuckles]
He surprised all of us, I'd say.

35:02.725 --> 35:04.936
He's just sweet like that, you know?

35:05.019 --> 35:07.772
Sweet. Yes, I can see that.

35:09.023 --> 35:10.525
Seems to mean well.

35:11.359 --> 35:12.819
I snagged a good one.

35:18.407 --> 35:20.034
But I can understand your concern.

35:20.618 --> 35:21.577
Concern?

35:22.954 --> 35:25.123
About him not liking our little town.

35:26.499 --> 35:28.626
I mean, I... I think he likes it.

35:28.709 --> 35:30.711
Oh, sure, he likes it now, but...

35:31.045 --> 35:32.130
You know, a man like him,

35:32.213 --> 35:34.549
he's gonna miss the excitement
of the big city, and...

35:35.216 --> 35:36.717
there'll be adjustments.

35:37.635 --> 35:41.222
There will, yes, but not anything
we can't handle together.

35:42.265 --> 35:43.349
Perhaps.

35:45.518 --> 35:48.604
[laughing] Oh, no.
The two of you will be just fine.

35:48.688 --> 35:49.856
I'm sure of it.

35:50.481 --> 35:51.816
I think we will.

35:56.028 --> 35:57.196
That was a fine steak.

35:58.990 --> 36:01.075
The secret is in the soy sauce.

36:02.910 --> 36:04.245
Soy sauce?

36:04.954 --> 36:06.372
Soy sauce.

36:07.832 --> 36:09.458
You know, they say,

36:09.542 --> 36:11.627
"Don't mix grape with grain,"

36:11.711 --> 36:12.545
but...

36:13.754 --> 36:15.047
But I won't tell anybody.

36:27.351 --> 36:30.897
You know, it's interesting
you're writing a novel.

36:32.106 --> 36:35.026
[sighs] I was never much
of a reader myself.

36:35.109 --> 36:38.487
You know, dime Westerns,
that type of thing.

36:38.571 --> 36:39.780
-[chuckles]
-Right.

36:40.281 --> 36:41.240
Hey.

36:44.368 --> 36:45.745
[sighs]

36:46.871 --> 36:48.289
That thing work?

36:51.459 --> 36:53.628
Wouldn't be worth a damn if it didn't.

37:00.092 --> 37:01.594
[Jonathan] Oh.

37:01.677 --> 37:02.678
[grunts]

37:03.804 --> 37:04.805
Oh.

37:07.183 --> 37:08.017
Hmm.

37:08.976 --> 37:09.977
[object clatters]

37:10.061 --> 37:11.145
Oh!

37:11.896 --> 37:13.773
You really had to get so drunk tonight?

37:13.856 --> 37:15.024
Baby...

37:17.193 --> 37:18.236
He kept pouring.

37:18.319 --> 37:20.446
Oh, yeah. "He kept pouring."

37:21.739 --> 37:22.865
[scoffs]

37:23.115 --> 37:24.200
You're pretty.

37:24.617 --> 37:26.410
And you're gonna be hung over.

37:26.869 --> 37:28.496
Do you have to work tomorrow?

37:29.372 --> 37:30.456
Maybe.

37:31.082 --> 37:33.000
Well, go drink some water, then.

37:35.878 --> 37:37.463
[sighs]

37:39.340 --> 37:40.800
Mmm.

37:44.095 --> 37:45.930
You think you're gonna be happy here?

37:47.890 --> 37:50.643
I am happy everywhere.

37:51.560 --> 37:52.561
Why?

37:53.271 --> 37:56.732
I don't know.
It just seems like you might get bored.

37:57.316 --> 37:58.567
That's not gonna happen.

38:00.695 --> 38:03.281
I suppose you'll have local icon,
Cathy Rhodes, around

38:03.364 --> 38:05.700
to discuss your favorite literature.

38:05.783 --> 38:09.578
[Jonathan chuckles]
Man. Who were those two?

38:10.121 --> 38:11.580
They made us dinner.

38:11.998 --> 38:13.416
But it was weird, right?

38:13.499 --> 38:15.876
[sighs] It was just different.

38:16.711 --> 38:17.962
They don't like me.

38:19.171 --> 38:20.631
Made that pretty clear.

38:21.424 --> 38:23.301
You're being sensitive.

38:24.385 --> 38:25.636
Proust!

38:27.013 --> 38:28.639
No one reads Proust.

38:29.682 --> 38:31.434
She was just trying to belittle me.

38:31.684 --> 38:33.477
[Michelle] She was not trying
to belittle you.

38:33.561 --> 38:35.479
She was taking a genuine interest.

38:35.563 --> 38:36.564
Yeah.

38:38.357 --> 38:41.902
Well, I say, next time, we...
[inhales] stick to my plan.

38:42.778 --> 38:44.655
We find a restaurant...

38:45.990 --> 38:49.535
I get it. There's gonna be some weirdness.

38:50.202 --> 38:52.330
Again, this is not the city.

38:53.039 --> 38:54.665
People are different.

38:55.166 --> 38:56.876
Things will be different.

38:58.252 --> 39:02.006
But as long as we do this together,
we're gonna figure it out, okay?

39:04.383 --> 39:06.218
And the Rhodes have been through a lot.

39:09.638 --> 39:10.848
Jonathan?

39:18.189 --> 39:19.190
Hon?

39:19.565 --> 39:20.566
[sighs]

39:24.612 --> 39:25.613
[exhales]

39:29.742 --> 39:32.620
-I know, it's just, not having you...
-I'm sorry.

39:32.703 --> 39:34.288
It's just another week, I'll be back.

39:36.791 --> 39:40.336
-I just wish you were here.
-I know. I know. I love you.

39:40.920 --> 39:41.921
Okay.

39:51.597 --> 39:53.808
[engine starts]

40:02.983 --> 40:04.193
[Michelle sighs]

40:10.658 --> 40:14.370
Oh. Hey, stranger.
You're in early. Everything okay?

40:14.453 --> 40:18.207
Uh, yeah, I'm fine. I just couldn't sleep.

40:19.041 --> 40:21.085
Jonathan surprised me last night. [sighs]

40:21.168 --> 40:23.421
Surprised you? With what?

40:23.504 --> 40:24.630
Himself.

40:25.339 --> 40:28.467
Oh, wow! So you bailed
on Mrs. Rhodes again?

40:28.551 --> 40:31.720
[sighs] No, uh, he came with me, actually.

40:33.264 --> 40:36.392
Oh, God. That's why
you're acting so weird.

40:37.351 --> 40:39.270
Uh... I don't know.

40:39.353 --> 40:43.190
How can two people I get along with
so well be so far apart?

40:43.774 --> 40:45.776
Like, they don't relate at all.

40:46.569 --> 40:48.779
Maybe you need a new perspective.

40:49.697 --> 40:51.031
What do you suggest?

40:51.991 --> 40:53.659
I suggest...

40:53.742 --> 40:56.996
the Rhodes aren't an easy introduction
for someone from the city.

40:58.038 --> 41:01.083
Why don't you come out
with me tonight?

41:01.167 --> 41:04.336
Meet some people you can relate to
a bit more and build from there.

41:05.045 --> 41:07.214
We have a regular group
that goes out on Fridays.

41:08.174 --> 41:09.592
Where do you even go out here?

41:10.342 --> 41:13.679
Crossroads.
It's literally the only bar in town.

41:13.846 --> 41:15.306
I... I don't know.

41:15.431 --> 41:17.224
Promise you'll think about it.

41:18.517 --> 41:20.269
Okay. Okay, I'll think about it.

41:20.394 --> 41:24.273
Okay. Great. We go out at 6:00. Be ready.

41:25.232 --> 41:27.193
Uh... [sighs]

41:43.000 --> 41:45.002
[young Michelle] <i>Mom, we're gonna be late.</i>

41:46.504 --> 41:47.505
<i>I love you, Mom.</i>

41:57.181 --> 41:58.891
[indistinct chattering]

41:58.974 --> 42:00.601
[music playing]

42:00.684 --> 42:03.229
-Yeah. I think I do too. Um, Elvis!
-[snaps fingers]

42:03.312 --> 42:04.897
Can I have... [laughs]

42:04.980 --> 42:06.649
...another beer, please. Thank you.

42:06.732 --> 42:08.609
[indistinct chattering]

42:09.109 --> 42:10.736
Oh, hey. Hey, this is Michelle.

42:10.819 --> 42:12.071
-Hi. Hey.
-[woman] How are you?

42:12.154 --> 42:14.073
-Good to see you.
-Nice to meet you.

42:14.156 --> 42:15.866
-[woman] Good.
-Hi.

42:25.417 --> 42:27.419
[Ashley] Jack, can I get a beer please?

42:27.753 --> 42:29.755
Yeah, thank you. [chuckles]

42:35.427 --> 42:36.887
[all chattering indistinctly]

42:47.064 --> 42:48.440
Mmm-hmm.

42:49.692 --> 42:51.277
All right. Here you go.

42:52.695 --> 42:55.322
[young Michelle on tape recorder]
<i>Mr. Poppins had seen the same grass</i>

42:55.406 --> 42:58.742
<i>and these same houses,</i>
<i>and this same world,</i>

42:58.826 --> 43:02.913
<i>day after day, week after week,</i>
<i>month after month.</i>

43:04.748 --> 43:05.916
[cell phone beeps]

43:14.800 --> 43:16.427
[sighs]

43:34.278 --> 43:35.279
[sighs]

43:49.335 --> 43:50.210
Jonathan.

43:50.669 --> 43:51.795
[cell phone beeps]

43:51.879 --> 43:52.880
[sighs]

43:53.714 --> 43:55.215
[whispers] Ah, pick up.

44:00.304 --> 44:02.306
[exhales] Pick up!

44:10.481 --> 44:11.857
[knocking on door]

44:16.195 --> 44:17.738
Cathy, hi.

44:19.823 --> 44:21.241
Michelle, everything okay?

44:21.325 --> 44:24.203
Yeah, I'm sorry, it's just...
I haven't heard from Jonathan.

44:24.745 --> 44:26.622
I mean, we were having issues
with the service,

44:26.705 --> 44:28.957
but, usually,
something goes through by now.

44:29.041 --> 44:31.627
It's just such a long drive
and I know accidents happen,

44:31.710 --> 44:33.754
and I just wanna make sure he's okay.

44:34.505 --> 44:36.632
I think I might know what the issue is.

44:37.508 --> 44:38.509
What?

44:43.138 --> 44:44.848
Oh, how did you...

44:44.932 --> 44:46.684
[Cathy] It's been blaring
all morning and...

44:46.767 --> 44:51.105
and I... I saw all these calls from you,
so I assumed it must be his.

44:51.188 --> 44:54.400
Oh, you poor thing.
You must be worried sick.

44:55.275 --> 44:56.735
Yeah. I have been.

44:57.778 --> 44:58.862
[sighs heavily]

45:00.322 --> 45:01.907
How'd you know where to bring it?

45:03.450 --> 45:04.451
What do you mean, dear?

45:05.327 --> 45:07.037
How do you know this is where I live?

45:11.917 --> 45:13.460
[cell phone beeps]

45:14.044 --> 45:15.045
Hello?

45:15.921 --> 45:17.840
Oh, my God!

45:17.923 --> 45:20.092
[sighs] Do you have any idea
how worried I've been?

45:20.175 --> 45:22.678
I am so sorry. I must have lost my cell.

45:22.761 --> 45:24.930
I didn't even realize it was gone
until last night--

45:25.013 --> 45:26.598
You didn't realize?

45:26.682 --> 45:29.184
No, no, no, I don't wanna hear it.
Just hold on.

45:29.685 --> 45:31.562
Uh, sorry. I... I gotta deal with this.

45:31.645 --> 45:32.730
Of course, sweetheart.

45:32.813 --> 45:35.774
I don't care what happened.
You have any idea how scared I've been?

45:36.233 --> 45:37.818
[mouthing]

45:41.905 --> 45:45.492
You thought what? You could just disappear
for a day and it wouldn't matter?

45:46.076 --> 45:47.453
I have your phone, okay?

45:47.536 --> 45:50.164
I have it because you left it
at the Rhodes' house

45:50.247 --> 45:52.082
and Cathy just stopped by with it.

45:52.166 --> 45:53.625
Oh, man, those two?

45:54.460 --> 45:57.588
-[sighs] Took 'em long enough to find it.
-"Took 'em long enough"? You serious?

45:57.671 --> 46:00.424
Were they just sitting on it all day
or something?

46:00.507 --> 46:02.176
That's weird. They're weird.

46:02.259 --> 46:03.594
<i>Michelle, they're like--</i>

46:03.677 --> 46:05.304
There's nothing weird, okay?

46:05.387 --> 46:06.930
They're decent people who realized

46:07.014 --> 46:08.974
how worried I would be
and brought back the phone

46:09.057 --> 46:11.477
-that you couldn't bother remembering.
-I just forgot it, okay?

46:11.560 --> 46:13.687
I have a lot going on
trying to get wrapped out of here.

46:13.771 --> 46:15.189
Think it's easy not having my phone?

46:15.272 --> 46:18.192
Oh, you think not having you here
is easy on me?

46:18.776 --> 46:20.819
While you're wrapping
out of work all weekend,

46:20.903 --> 46:22.738
I'll be here alone!

46:22.821 --> 46:24.698
Unpacking all our stuff alone

46:24.782 --> 46:27.576
<i>and setting up our house</i>
<i>and our life, alone.</i>

46:27.659 --> 46:29.620
Look, I gotta go.
I'm sorry I can't be there.

46:29.703 --> 46:32.498
Maybe your new friends that hate
everything about me can give you a hand.

46:32.581 --> 46:34.625
I need you, okay?

46:35.417 --> 46:37.294
Now more than ever.

46:37.377 --> 46:40.464
I... I can't stand not being able to talk.

46:40.547 --> 46:42.466
Okay, look, if you need something,

46:42.549 --> 46:45.469
call my office line and I will call you
as soon as I can.

46:45.552 --> 46:47.054
<i>Okay? I love you. Bye.</i>

46:47.137 --> 46:48.388
[line disconnects]

46:50.557 --> 46:52.017
[cell phone beeps]

47:07.449 --> 47:10.202
-Cathy? Hi. You're still here.
-Oh.

47:10.285 --> 47:11.829
[chuckles] I'm sorry.

47:11.912 --> 47:14.915
Um, I... I don't want to impose.

47:15.499 --> 47:17.876
It... Uh... It's fine.

47:18.418 --> 47:19.461
What's up?

47:19.545 --> 47:21.046
Uh, well, it's just, um,

47:21.129 --> 47:24.883
I had some thoughts
for my final <i>Mr. Poppins</i> book.

47:24.967 --> 47:26.260
And sometimes I...

47:26.343 --> 47:29.763
I like to talk these things through,
out loud.

47:29.847 --> 47:34.142
And, Derek, God bless him,
is not the most attentive audience.

47:34.560 --> 47:36.228
I appreciate that, Cathy.

47:36.311 --> 47:39.481
I just have so much
I need to get done right now.

47:40.023 --> 47:43.151
Oh. Oh, not now, by any means.
No, of course not.

47:43.235 --> 47:45.946
Um, I... I wanted you to come by.

47:46.029 --> 47:47.990
Uh, maybe later this weekend.

47:48.073 --> 47:49.449
[sighs]

47:50.242 --> 47:54.997
I need to get this place set up,
get my life back together.

47:56.582 --> 47:57.791
Okay.

47:59.710 --> 48:00.878
Okay, I see.

48:03.213 --> 48:04.756
How about Monday?

48:05.132 --> 48:07.217
I can do Monday, after school.

48:08.844 --> 48:11.388
Monday it is.
You have a good weekend, sweetheart.

48:30.198 --> 48:32.951
[gasps] Oh, my God. Cathy.

48:33.035 --> 48:34.369
[exhales deeply]

48:34.453 --> 48:35.662
Bit jumpy, aren't we?

48:35.746 --> 48:39.249
Sorry, it's just, it's usually...
There's no one in here this early.

48:39.333 --> 48:41.877
-Just you?
-[Ashley] Mmm. Just me.

48:42.961 --> 48:45.505
Oh, these kids can be a handful.

48:45.589 --> 48:49.509
Right. Well, it's not like you have time
for them over the weekend.

48:50.135 --> 48:51.136
Sure.

48:51.219 --> 48:52.971
-Sorry.
-Mmm-hmm.

48:53.722 --> 48:56.099
We all have lives outside of work.

48:56.183 --> 48:57.434
Oh, I shouldn't expect someone

48:57.517 --> 48:59.686
to give every second
of their life to education.

48:59.770 --> 49:00.812
Right.

49:01.313 --> 49:03.982
Especially, if they have
a certain lifestyle to maintain.

49:06.693 --> 49:08.028
What lifestyle?

49:10.739 --> 49:12.282
Let me ask you a question.

49:13.450 --> 49:16.787
Mr. Cochran, he was miserable
at managing a budget.

49:17.412 --> 49:18.455
Was he not?

49:19.206 --> 49:23.126
Honestly, I have no idea
how we managed to stay open.

49:23.251 --> 49:26.755
[chuckles] Oh, well,
I think if you look closely,

49:26.838 --> 49:30.968
that you would find
a number of anonymous donations

49:31.051 --> 49:33.261
that managed to fill the gaps.

49:34.429 --> 49:38.600
Cathy, I know how much
the program means to you.

49:39.643 --> 49:42.187
And I think that you'd find how impossible

49:42.270 --> 49:45.232
it would be to maintain
this program without them.

49:45.941 --> 49:49.403
And you have to know
how much it means to me as well.

49:49.861 --> 49:51.279
How much it means to Michelle.

49:51.363 --> 49:53.907
Oh, I know how much it means
to the both of you

49:53.991 --> 49:58.370
and how devastating it would be
if the funding were to dry up.

49:59.371 --> 50:01.873
Is there a reason to think it would?

50:03.917 --> 50:06.044
It's hard to say just yet.

50:09.297 --> 50:12.843
I think this program needs to be held
to the highest standards

50:12.926 --> 50:13.927
by those who run it.

50:15.262 --> 50:17.764
Which... it is.

50:17.848 --> 50:18.974
And I was thinking,

50:19.057 --> 50:22.269
"Is it prudent for us
to trust our children

50:22.352 --> 50:24.688
with a young college dropout?"

50:25.731 --> 50:27.816
I'm sorry,
why didn't you finish school, again?

50:29.484 --> 50:30.986
Oh, it... It doesn't matter.

50:31.069 --> 50:34.197
And then, for that dropout
to take our new manager

50:34.281 --> 50:36.450
out drinking with her after school.

50:37.200 --> 50:42.039
Cathy, there's nothing wrong
with going out on a Friday night.

50:43.123 --> 50:47.210
Well, I guess that's up
for the parents to decide.

50:47.753 --> 50:50.672
And I think they would have
all sorts of opinions

50:50.756 --> 50:53.258
were they to hear
that the funding was being pulled

50:53.341 --> 50:58.513
because of the behavior
of our new program manager and teacher.

51:01.600 --> 51:02.684
You wouldn't.

51:03.685 --> 51:07.272
Oh, I wouldn't want to. No.

51:07.355 --> 51:08.440
But I guess it would depend

51:08.523 --> 51:10.859
on how negative an influence
they had on the program.

51:11.943 --> 51:13.403
And each other.

51:17.491 --> 51:19.159
Well, it's just something to consider.

51:47.229 --> 51:48.855
[clock ticking]

52:04.037 --> 52:06.832
Hey! Missing my nap date today.

52:08.208 --> 52:09.626
Sorry. Just busy.

52:12.754 --> 52:14.965
Yeah. No, of course.

52:16.591 --> 52:18.343
[sighs] It's just, um...

52:19.386 --> 52:22.556
Things kind of blew up
with Jonathan over the weekend.

52:23.348 --> 52:24.891
You probably don't care that much,

52:24.975 --> 52:28.270
but I was just needing someone
to talk to about it.

52:28.353 --> 52:29.729
That sucks. But, um...

52:29.813 --> 52:32.899
Look, let's talk later.
I gotta stay on this.

52:34.526 --> 52:36.278
Yeah. No, got it.

52:37.404 --> 52:38.572
Tonight?

52:39.406 --> 52:40.448
Pretty busy.

52:41.616 --> 52:43.076
We'll talk soon, though.

52:43.702 --> 52:45.203
Yeah. Sounds good.

52:57.757 --> 52:59.259
[doorbell rings]

53:01.720 --> 53:03.138
Sweetheart, you made it.

53:03.221 --> 53:04.514
-I did.
-[Cathy chuckles]

53:06.016 --> 53:07.684
Everything okay?

53:07.767 --> 53:09.644
Yeah. Just, um...

53:09.728 --> 53:10.979
Just a tough day.

53:11.062 --> 53:13.398
Aw, well, let's head on in

53:13.481 --> 53:15.984
and see if we can't cheer you up a bit?

53:16.067 --> 53:16.985
Okay?

53:30.916 --> 53:32.167
[Cathy] A glass for you?

53:33.043 --> 53:34.211
I'm okay for now.

53:38.089 --> 53:39.174
Honey...

53:40.800 --> 53:43.220
Why don't you tell me
what's got you so worried?

53:44.012 --> 53:45.472
It's nothing. [sighs]

53:45.555 --> 53:49.309
Just feels like things went from promising
to train wreck in a matter of days.

53:50.268 --> 53:52.479
Well, you can always talk it out with me.

53:53.521 --> 53:54.606
I know.

53:55.649 --> 53:59.152
You've actually been
the only constant since I got here.

54:00.320 --> 54:01.613
And I always will be.

54:03.740 --> 54:05.700
Really, it's nothing, uh...

54:05.784 --> 54:08.995
Look at me trying to take this over
when you wanna talk about your book.

54:09.788 --> 54:12.040
Oh... [chuckles]

54:12.123 --> 54:15.001
Mr. Poppins' last adventure. Hmm.

54:16.086 --> 54:18.046
He finally coming home?

54:19.130 --> 54:21.383
After our last talk, uh,

54:21.466 --> 54:23.385
it got me thinking and...

54:24.219 --> 54:25.220
it's time.

54:25.845 --> 54:27.097
Well, that's exciting.

54:27.973 --> 54:29.516
I feel you're right.

54:30.600 --> 54:33.478
He's been out in the world,
he's seen all there is to see.

54:33.728 --> 54:35.355
But now he's ready to come back.

54:36.731 --> 54:40.193
And there'll be a big celebration
for all those who have missed him

54:40.277 --> 54:42.070
when he was gone.

54:43.613 --> 54:45.573
Because everyone finds their way home.

54:46.658 --> 54:47.701
Eventually.

54:49.953 --> 54:51.079
Don't you think?

54:51.913 --> 54:55.834
I, uh... I think
that's a great direction to take it.

55:08.179 --> 55:09.931
Can I show you something?

55:17.230 --> 55:20.567
So, I'm sure that you've already heard
about my little girl.

55:21.609 --> 55:23.820
And how she went missing so long ago.

55:23.903 --> 55:25.238
[Michelle] I did.

55:25.322 --> 55:26.781
I'm so sorry, Cathy.

55:26.865 --> 55:29.868
Well, when your daughter
goes missing like that,

55:29.951 --> 55:32.996
you make a lot of friends
in important places.

55:33.079 --> 55:35.957
Friends who are willing
to help a mother out.

55:36.249 --> 55:37.292
I'm sure.

55:38.543 --> 55:40.670
And at first I thought
it was just a coincidence,

55:40.754 --> 55:43.798
but I had a friend do a little favor...

55:44.507 --> 55:47.385
and look up some
of your background information

55:47.469 --> 55:49.596
from the times that you can't remember.

55:51.431 --> 55:52.640
What do you mean?

56:10.700 --> 56:13.536
When you first arrived
into state custody...

56:14.704 --> 56:16.122
it was 20 years ago.

56:17.290 --> 56:19.751
The exact same time my little girl...

56:20.543 --> 56:22.629
my Michelle, went missing.

56:27.300 --> 56:30.178
[Michelle] Her name was Michelle, too?

56:40.688 --> 56:42.440
[Cathy] He was your favorite.

56:45.276 --> 56:46.319
Mr. Poppins.

56:47.612 --> 56:49.697
You loved him so much.

56:51.116 --> 56:52.575
Do you remember, sweetheart?

56:56.955 --> 56:58.623
You would always sleep with him.

56:58.706 --> 57:01.960
You, you... You couldn't fall asleep
without him.

57:03.545 --> 57:04.838
You left him.

57:06.464 --> 57:09.175
You left him so I'd know you'd come back.

57:11.094 --> 57:12.846
Uh, I, uh...

57:13.805 --> 57:15.306
Cathy, I'm not her.

57:20.019 --> 57:21.688
Uh, maybe if you smell him.

57:26.192 --> 57:28.194
I can still smell you on him.

57:30.613 --> 57:31.614
[inhales sharply]

57:31.698 --> 57:32.866
Uh...

57:37.871 --> 57:39.706
Cathy, I'm not your daughter.

57:46.588 --> 57:48.423
[young Michelle] <i>The street was familiar.</i>

57:48.506 --> 57:51.968
<i>The same well-groomed lawns,</i>
<i>the same cared-for houses...</i>

57:52.051 --> 57:56.514
See, I used to record all my stories
and my ideas on tape and you'd help me.

57:57.015 --> 58:00.059
You wanted to be just like Mommy,
I even got you your own tape recorder.

58:00.143 --> 58:01.227
Look, I have to go.

58:01.311 --> 58:03.313
Okay, but why this town?

58:03.396 --> 58:05.857
You've always wanted this. Don't you see?

58:05.940 --> 58:07.358
This... Uh, no. No, I'm sorry.

58:08.067 --> 58:09.194
[Cathy] Where are you going?

58:09.277 --> 58:12.989
[recording continues]<i> He wanted to see</i>
<i>something different, something exciting.</i>

58:13.072 --> 58:14.157
[Cathy] You're home!

58:14.240 --> 58:16.993
[on tape] <i>So, he packed a knapsack</i>
<i>with everything it would fit</i>

58:17.076 --> 58:19.954
<i>and he left this place</i>
<i>that was so familiar,</i>

58:20.038 --> 58:22.081
<i>to begin an adventure into the unknown.</i>

58:23.458 --> 58:24.709
Baby, you're home.

58:29.130 --> 58:31.466
[breathing heavily]

58:31.549 --> 58:33.426
[line ringing]

58:35.970 --> 58:37.764
<i>You've reached the desk</i>

58:37.847 --> 58:39.140
<i>I've stepped away for a moment,</i>

58:39.224 --> 58:41.267
<i>but just leave a message</i>
<i>and I will get back to you.</i>

58:41.351 --> 58:42.560
[breathes heavily]

58:42.644 --> 58:43.728
Hey, babe.

58:43.811 --> 58:46.439
I know you won't get this till tomorrow,
but I am...

58:46.523 --> 58:50.151
Just call me as soon as you can, okay?
Things got weird.

58:50.818 --> 58:51.819
You were right.

58:52.403 --> 58:53.530
Love you.

58:59.911 --> 59:01.120
<i>Hi, you've reached Ashley.</i>

59:01.204 --> 59:04.415
<i>Leave me a message</i>
<i>and I'll get back to you soon. Bye.</i>

59:09.546 --> 59:12.215
Derek, hi. I... I didn't see you there.

59:17.220 --> 59:19.931
[Michelle screaming, grunting]

59:20.932 --> 59:22.100
[Derek grunts]

59:22.809 --> 59:23.893
Stop!

59:24.811 --> 59:25.812
Slow down!

-[Derek] Get back here! [grunting]

59:40.535 --> 59:44.539
[Ashley on phone] <i>Hey, you. Look,</i>
<i>I'm sorry things got so awkward.</i>

59:44.622 --> 59:47.292
<i>I've been thinking about it and,</i>
<i>you know, I was stupid.</i>

59:47.375 --> 59:49.294
<i>I should have just told you</i>
<i>what was going on.</i>

59:49.377 --> 59:51.254
<i>And, instead, I was a jerk.</i>

59:51.337 --> 59:52.380
Stop it!

59:55.425 --> 59:57.010
[Derek grunts]

59:57.093 --> 59:59.220

1:00:10.273 --> 1:00:11.733
[Ashley] <i>Call me back, okay?</i>

1:00:11.816 --> 1:00:15.862
<i>I have some stuff to talk to you about</i>

1:00:16.321 --> 1:00:17.363
<i>Talk to you soon.</i>

1:00:17.447 --> 1:00:19.907

1:00:37.884 --> 1:00:39.385
It's okay, honey.

1:00:40.303 --> 1:00:44.223
You're home now.
Everything's gonna be okay.

1:00:44.974 --> 1:00:47.435
[young Michelle] <i>But that wasn't enough</i>
<i>for Mr. Poppins.</i>

1:00:53.524 --> 1:00:56.277

Michelle?

Cathy?

[screams] Help!

1:03:37.897 --> 1:03:40.691
[screams] Help me, please! Help! Help!

1:03:40.775 --> 1:03:44.529
Michelle! Michelle!
Michelle! Michelle! Shh, shh, shh.

1:03:44.612 --> 1:03:46.489
I know. I know you're scared right now.

1:03:46.572 --> 1:03:50.535
But I'm gonna need you
to keep quiet for me, okay? Okay?

1:03:51.536 --> 1:03:54.497
-Um, please, I won't tell any--
-Be... quiet.

1:03:55.206 --> 1:03:56.541
Trust me, this...

1:03:57.333 --> 1:04:00.545
This can get a whole lot worse
than it is right now.

1:04:05.716 --> 1:04:06.717
[knocking]

1:04:11.305 --> 1:04:13.182
Jonathan. What are you doing in town?

1:04:13.266 --> 1:04:15.810
Hi, Mrs. Rhodes. Have you seen Michelle?

1:04:16.269 --> 1:04:18.187
Um, yes, I have.

1:04:18.271 --> 1:04:20.231
Last night, as a matter of fact,
she came by,

1:04:20.314 --> 1:04:21.983
she wanted to hear about my next book.

1:04:22.066 --> 1:04:23.860
Why? Is something wrong?

1:04:23.943 --> 1:04:25.403
[sighs] I don't know. She...

1:04:25.486 --> 1:04:27.822
She's not at home.
She's not answering her phone.

1:04:28.239 --> 1:04:31.242
Uh, well, it is Tuesday.
Did you check the school?

1:04:31.325 --> 1:04:33.995
I mean, she should be working,
shouldn't she?

1:04:34.078 --> 1:04:35.371
Yeah. I, uh...

1:04:36.080 --> 1:04:37.999
Oh, well, so you haven't.

1:04:38.082 --> 1:04:39.083
No, not yet.

1:04:39.166 --> 1:04:41.377
Okay. Well, sweetie, I'd start there.

1:04:41.460 --> 1:04:44.547
And then, um, maybe ask that Ashley woman

1:04:44.630 --> 1:04:46.841
with whom she's been spending
all her time drinking.

1:04:46.966 --> 1:04:49.427
Ashley? I don't know an Ashley.

1:04:49.886 --> 1:04:51.304
Well, maybe you should.

1:04:52.054 --> 1:04:53.306
Goodbye, Jonathan.

1:05:00.605 --> 1:05:02.315
[footsteps approaching]

1:05:05.568 --> 1:05:07.987
[sighs] Michelle, my baby.

1:05:09.155 --> 1:05:11.365
I am so sorry
we had to do things this way.

1:05:12.783 --> 1:05:15.786
[breathing heavily]
Why are you doing this?

1:05:16.704 --> 1:05:18.956
[sighs] It's gonna be hard, sweetie.

1:05:19.874 --> 1:05:22.084
See, you've been away from us for so long,

1:05:22.168 --> 1:05:24.211
you don't even remember who you are.

1:05:24.295 --> 1:05:26.047
And that is not your fault.

1:05:26.130 --> 1:05:28.674
Please, Cathy. I'm not her.

1:05:29.008 --> 1:05:30.426
I'm not your Michelle.

1:05:32.011 --> 1:05:33.387
I know you think that.

1:05:34.472 --> 1:05:37.224
But just spend some time here.

1:05:38.225 --> 1:05:39.727
Try to remember.

1:05:40.811 --> 1:05:41.938
You'll come back.

1:05:42.688 --> 1:05:44.065
You'll understand.

1:05:48.569 --> 1:05:49.403
[grunts]

1:05:50.363 --> 1:05:52.406
I'm just trying to take care of my baby.

1:05:53.407 --> 1:05:54.492
[Michelle yells]

1:05:54.575 --> 1:05:55.785
[banging on door]

1:05:56.702 --> 1:05:58.037
[straining]

1:05:59.121 --> 1:06:01.290
Please, let me out!

1:06:03.417 --> 1:06:05.002
[sobbing]

1:06:25.189 --> 1:06:27.400
Um... Can I help you?

1:06:27.525 --> 1:06:29.527
Yeah. Yeah.

1:06:30.486 --> 1:06:32.113
I'm looking for Ashley.

1:06:32.196 --> 1:06:33.406
Well, you found her.

1:06:33.906 --> 1:06:34.782
Do I know you?

1:06:34.907 --> 1:06:37.535
I'm... I'm Jonathan,
I'm Michelle's fiancé.

1:06:37.618 --> 1:06:40.579
Oh, are you here to tell me
why she didn't show up today,

1:06:40.663 --> 1:06:43.374
-why she didn't bother to call?
-You haven't seen her either?

1:06:43.457 --> 1:06:44.875
Not since yesterday.

1:06:46.293 --> 1:06:49.213
-Wait, you don't know where she is?
-No, she... She left a message.

1:06:49.296 --> 1:06:51.298
She said something got weird last night.

1:06:52.258 --> 1:06:53.092
Oh, God.

1:06:53.175 --> 1:06:55.511
-What?
-Um, I don't know. She...

1:06:55.594 --> 1:06:57.263
-What?
-What did she say?

1:06:57.346 --> 1:06:59.640
Nothing else, really.
But I can't get a hold of her.

1:06:59.724 --> 1:07:01.017
Okay. Did you try Cathy?

1:07:01.100 --> 1:07:02.935
-They said she wasn't there.
-And the police?

1:07:03.019 --> 1:07:05.312
I called. And they said
I could file a report,

1:07:05.396 --> 1:07:07.648
but they need 48 hours
before they can take any action.

1:07:07.732 --> 1:07:09.025
That's not really a thing, is it?

1:07:09.108 --> 1:07:10.860
Apparently, they need
a reason to investigate.

1:07:10.943 --> 1:07:12.653
And right now
they don't have enough to...

1:07:13.070 --> 1:07:14.113
Enough to what?

1:07:14.196 --> 1:07:16.198
I think I have an idea. Thanks.

1:07:18.284 --> 1:07:19.285
Hey!

Honey...

1:09:39.717 --> 1:09:43.053
We're trying to make this easy,
but you've got to behave yourself.

1:09:44.180 --> 1:09:47.892
Please, Cathy. Just let me go, okay?

1:09:47.975 --> 1:09:49.852
I'm not gonna tell anyone,
I'll just leave.

1:09:49.935 --> 1:09:50.978
What would you tell them?

1:09:51.854 --> 1:09:55.191
That you're where you belong? Finally.

1:09:55.274 --> 1:09:56.984
That you've come back home?

1:09:57.651 --> 1:10:01.238
[chuckles] Oh, we should tell everyone.

1:10:01.780 --> 1:10:06.702
It should be on the news.
"Missing child returns after 20 years."

1:10:08.954 --> 1:10:11.957
But we first gotta get
your memory back.

1:10:22.343 --> 1:10:23.552
Anything yet?

1:10:25.179 --> 1:10:26.513
There's nothing to tell.

1:10:27.389 --> 1:10:30.517
I'm from Pennsylvania.
I was taken away when I was seven.

1:10:30.601 --> 1:10:32.228
Okay. Before that.

1:10:33.938 --> 1:10:36.607
That morning.
Do you remember that Tuesday morning?

1:10:37.149 --> 1:10:40.319
The sandwich, with the crusts cut off?

1:10:40.986 --> 1:10:42.238
Who took you?

1:10:43.030 --> 1:10:46.283
I told you, my mom couldn't keep up,
so the state did.

1:10:46.367 --> 1:10:47.618
I remember my mom, okay?

1:10:47.701 --> 1:10:48.786
Stop!

1:10:51.914 --> 1:10:53.540
That is what they told you.

1:10:53.916 --> 1:10:55.542
That is not what happened.

1:11:01.048 --> 1:11:02.216
Oh...

1:11:02.967 --> 1:11:04.051
Not a peep.

1:11:05.594 --> 1:11:06.887
[knocking continues]

1:11:11.350 --> 1:11:12.643
[grunts in frustration]

1:11:19.358 --> 1:11:20.234
What do you want?

1:11:20.317 --> 1:11:21.485
Is my fiancée in there?

1:11:21.568 --> 1:11:22.569
[Derek] Your what?

1:11:22.653 --> 1:11:24.238
Michelle. Is she in there?

1:11:24.321 --> 1:11:27.283
She wasn't here the first time you came.
She's not here this time, all right?

1:11:27.366 --> 1:11:28.409
I don't believe you.

1:11:28.492 --> 1:11:31.078
You believe whatever you want,
but that's not gonna change anything.

1:11:31.161 --> 1:11:32.788
-I think it will.
-[Derek] Really?

1:11:32.871 --> 1:11:33.914
-Michelle!
-Hey.

1:11:33.998 --> 1:11:36.417
-You in there? Talk to me.
-Hey! Knock it off.

1:11:36.500 --> 1:11:39.336
-Anybody. Can you hear me?
-Stop it. Hey, listen. Stop it.

1:11:39.420 --> 1:11:42.047
Can you hear me?
I'm looking for my fiancée, Michelle!

1:11:42.756 --> 1:11:45.259
Hey, you're creating
a domestic disturbance here, all right?

1:11:45.342 --> 1:11:47.928
Yeah, I am. And we'll see what happens
when the cops show up.

1:11:48.012 --> 1:11:49.179
Really?

1:11:51.432 --> 1:11:52.558
[whispers inaudibly]

1:11:53.517 --> 1:11:56.020
[softly] Okay. Jonathan, son,
you're creating a scene.

1:11:56.103 --> 1:11:57.771
You're damn right I am.

1:11:57.855 --> 1:11:59.773
[Cathy] Do you want to see Michelle?

1:11:59.857 --> 1:12:01.066
Uh-huh.

1:12:01.942 --> 1:12:03.819
Okay. Well, she's here.

1:12:04.320 --> 1:12:06.655
She's here,
but she doesn't wanna talk to you.

1:12:07.573 --> 1:12:10.075
You... You think I'm gonna believe that?

1:12:10.159 --> 1:12:11.493
She needed her space,

1:12:11.577 --> 1:12:14.455
and she didn't want you to know
that she's here, so she had us lie.

1:12:16.165 --> 1:12:19.877
No. No, if she's in there,
I need to see her right now.

1:12:22.171 --> 1:12:24.048
Okay, fine.

1:12:26.300 --> 1:12:28.969
[Cathy] Michelle, honey.
Jonathan wants to see you.

1:12:29.345 --> 1:12:30.346
Jonathan.

1:12:31.263 --> 1:12:32.723
Jonathan!

1:12:32.806 --> 1:12:34.892
Please! Help me!

1:12:36.727 --> 1:12:37.895
[grunts]

1:12:37.978 --> 1:12:40.105
-[Jonathan groaning]
-[grunts]

1:12:41.774 --> 1:12:43.317
That boy's been nothing but trouble.

1:12:45.319 --> 1:12:48.906
Look, don't worry. He'll be okay.
Hey, close the door. Quick.

1:12:56.497 --> 1:12:58.791
-[footsteps approaching]
-[Michelle breathing heavily]

1:13:01.418 --> 1:13:03.379
-[Michelle] What'd you do to him?
-No, no!

1:13:03.462 --> 1:13:06.340
You stay over there
or I'll keep this closed till morning.

1:13:12.012 --> 1:13:13.097
[sniffles]

1:13:20.938 --> 1:13:22.314
He'll be fine.

1:13:23.482 --> 1:13:24.817
Derek did not mean to hurt him.

1:13:24.900 --> 1:13:26.985
It's just that he was making
so much noise out there.

1:13:27.069 --> 1:13:28.779
What if someone had called the police?

1:13:33.409 --> 1:13:34.410
Okay.

1:13:36.245 --> 1:13:37.371
You know, um...

1:13:38.122 --> 1:13:40.040
Why don't we try this again tomorrow?

1:13:40.124 --> 1:13:41.959
You're in no shape to talk tonight.

1:13:44.586 --> 1:13:46.380
Mama? [breathes heavily]

1:13:50.300 --> 1:13:51.218
What did you say?

1:13:55.013 --> 1:13:56.014
Mom.

1:13:59.518 --> 1:14:01.854
Is this real or are you pretending?

1:14:04.773 --> 1:14:07.609
I remember... [sniffles]

1:14:08.569 --> 1:14:10.320
That morning.

1:14:11.321 --> 1:14:12.739
Mr. Poppins.

1:14:17.369 --> 1:14:18.620
You left him.

1:14:21.165 --> 1:14:23.959
You almost always brought him
to school with you.

1:14:25.335 --> 1:14:26.462
I did.

1:14:27.296 --> 1:14:28.714
I left him.

1:14:31.842 --> 1:14:33.677
Mama... [sniffles]

1:14:35.179 --> 1:14:37.306
I know now why I forgot.

1:14:38.432 --> 1:14:39.600
What is it?

1:14:41.810 --> 1:14:44.521
It's hard for me to talk about it. I...

1:14:45.063 --> 1:14:46.398
[sniffles]

1:14:47.649 --> 1:14:49.610
I was running away.

1:14:50.986 --> 1:14:52.488
It wasn't you, Mama.

1:14:54.323 --> 1:14:55.157
[sniffles]

1:14:55.616 --> 1:14:56.783
I hid it.

1:15:00.412 --> 1:15:02.456
I didn't want you to find it.

1:15:05.083 --> 1:15:06.877
I didn't want him to hurt you.

1:15:07.336 --> 1:15:08.253
[sniffles]

1:15:10.797 --> 1:15:12.424
[Derek on tape]<i> Stop it!</i>
<i>Would you stop it?</i>

1:15:12.508 --> 1:15:14.009
<i>You're not hurt. Shh, be quiet.</i>

1:15:14.092 --> 1:15:16.929
<i>I told you not to cry. Don't you dare cry.</i>

1:15:18.013 --> 1:15:20.390
<i>-Did you learn your lesson?</i>
-[young Michelle] <i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

1:15:20.891 --> 1:15:22.518
[Derek] <i>This time it better stick.</i>

1:15:23.185 --> 1:15:25.437
<i>And you remember</i>
<i>what happens if you tell Mommy.</i>

1:15:25.521 --> 1:15:28.106
[young Michelle]<i> You...</i>
<i>You will hurt her, too.</i>

1:15:28.524 --> 1:15:31.735
[Derek]<i> That's right, Michelle.</i>
<i>And whose fault will that be?</i>

1:15:31.818 --> 1:15:33.237
[young Michelle] <i>Mine.</i>

1:15:33.320 --> 1:15:34.821
[Derek]<i> Right.</i>

1:15:34.905 --> 1:15:35.781
[tape stops]

1:15:39.743 --> 1:15:41.370
It wasn't you, Mama.

1:15:42.996 --> 1:15:45.123
[sobs] He used to hurt me so bad.

1:15:47.793 --> 1:15:49.878
I did it for you, Mom.

1:15:52.422 --> 1:15:55.551
That's... That's fine. Honey.

1:15:57.719 --> 1:16:00.055
I think... I think we're making...

1:16:01.974 --> 1:16:03.350
great progress.

1:16:03.433 --> 1:16:05.435
[panting] I'm sorry.

1:16:06.895 --> 1:16:08.647
-I'm sorry, Mom.
-[Cathy] Okay.

1:16:12.985 --> 1:16:14.861
You just get some sleep.

1:16:16.655 --> 1:16:18.407
We'll talk about this tomorrow.

1:16:25.205 --> 1:16:26.456
[door closes]

1:16:26.540 --> 1:16:28.250
[lock clicks]

1:16:30.210 --> 1:16:32.045
[sobbing]

1:16:33.046 --> 1:16:34.756
[footsteps approaching]

1:16:42.472 --> 1:16:43.974
Everything okay, honey?

1:16:46.768 --> 1:16:49.313
Well, this one's gonna be a problem,
but I'll, uh...

1:16:49.396 --> 1:16:51.982
I'll fix it. I'll make sure
he doesn't go near our little girl.

1:16:53.483 --> 1:16:54.526
Mmm-hmm.

1:16:58.530 --> 1:16:59.781
Hey, uh...

1:17:02.367 --> 1:17:03.535
You okay, baby?

1:17:06.163 --> 1:17:07.164
Yeah.

1:17:16.590 --> 1:17:17.883
Well, um...

1:17:19.676 --> 1:17:21.720
I'll go get some tape
to cover his mouth.

1:17:21.803 --> 1:17:24.014
You make sure
he doesn't go anywhere, all right?

1:17:33.398 --> 1:17:35.776
[Jonathan gasps, groans]

1:17:46.078 --> 1:17:47.454
[knife swishes]

1:17:48.872 --> 1:17:50.332
[groans]

1:17:55.003 --> 1:17:56.296
[door opens]

1:18:03.762 --> 1:18:05.097
What did you do?

1:18:07.724 --> 1:18:09.726
You're not a good man, Daddy.

1:18:16.149 --> 1:18:18.235
You did very bad things to me.

1:18:21.863 --> 1:18:23.615
You used to hit me so hard.

1:18:23.699 --> 1:18:25.867
-[Derek] Stop it!
-[Michelle screams]

1:18:25.951 --> 1:18:27.244
Come on!

1:18:27.327 --> 1:18:28.954
Stop! Stop, stay down!

1:18:29.037 --> 1:18:31.498
Stop it! Listen to me!

1:18:31.581 --> 1:18:33.417
You're hurting me, Daddy!

1:18:33.500 --> 1:18:36.670
[groans] You're hurting me
just like before.

1:18:38.714 --> 1:18:41.299
Don't... Don't you pretend.

1:18:42.801 --> 1:18:44.052
Not with me.

1:18:46.680 --> 1:18:48.515
Mama knows now, Daddy.

1:18:50.267 --> 1:18:52.060
She knows what you did to me.

1:18:53.145 --> 1:18:55.355
You knew I ran away because of you.

1:18:56.189 --> 1:18:58.275
'Cause you couldn't beat me if I ran.

1:18:58.734 --> 1:19:00.193
[Derek groans]

1:19:01.319 --> 1:19:02.487
Get over here!

1:19:02.571 --> 1:19:04.156
[both grunting]

1:19:04.781 --> 1:19:06.908
-[grunts]
-[Michelle gasps]

1:19:07.743 --> 1:19:09.703
You and I...

1:19:09.786 --> 1:19:12.122
both know... Cathy wanted this.

1:19:12.205 --> 1:19:15.041
She wants it all to be true.
So you have two choices.

1:19:15.125 --> 1:19:17.210
-[choking]
-You can either play along,

1:19:17.294 --> 1:19:20.380
or I can tell her
that you ran away again...

1:19:20.881 --> 1:19:21.965
[Michelle choking]

1:19:22.048 --> 1:19:24.050
And make sure that you never come back.

1:19:25.385 --> 1:19:27.763
-[Derek grunts]
-[gasping, choking]

1:19:29.848 --> 1:19:32.017
I will do anything for my wife.

1:19:34.060 --> 1:19:36.730
I've always done anything
I could for my Cathy.

1:19:37.147 --> 1:19:40.400
Oh, if you only knew what I've sacrificed,

1:19:41.109 --> 1:19:42.360
what I've endured.

1:19:43.111 --> 1:19:45.030
I just want to be a good husband.

1:19:47.115 --> 1:19:48.408
I am a good husband.

1:19:49.576 --> 1:19:53.038
[straining] Please, don't do it, Daddy.

1:19:53.121 --> 1:19:55.081
Please, Daddy. Stop.

1:19:55.624 --> 1:20:00.128
You... are not... my daughter!

1:20:07.469 --> 1:20:09.971
[gasping]

1:20:14.017 --> 1:20:17.562
Come here, baby. I got you. I got you.

1:20:18.522 --> 1:20:21.107
I got you, baby. I'm so sorry.

1:20:22.526 --> 1:20:24.110
I'm so sorry.

1:20:26.279 --> 1:20:27.781
You're gonna be okay.

1:20:28.657 --> 1:20:30.367
You're gonna be okay.

1:20:32.077 --> 1:20:33.703
Because we're together now.

1:20:33.787 --> 1:20:35.956
And I'm never letting you go.

1:20:44.756 --> 1:20:46.883
[sobbing] I won't leave you again.

1:20:55.433 --> 1:20:57.394
[operator] <i>911 dispatch.</i>
<i>What's your emergency?</i>

1:20:57.519 --> 1:20:59.145

1:21:45.525 --> 1:21:46.818
[grumbles]

1:21:47.986 --> 1:21:50.238
I don't think they gave us enough screws.

1:21:51.907 --> 1:21:53.283
Can you pass me the instructions?

1:21:53.366 --> 1:21:54.409
Yeah.

1:21:55.660 --> 1:21:57.495
-Thanks.
-[knocking on door]

1:21:58.246 --> 1:21:59.247
Thanks. I got it.

1:22:00.498 --> 1:22:01.958
It's probably Ashley.

1:22:09.841 --> 1:22:10.884
Hey.

1:22:10.967 --> 1:22:11.968
Thanks.

It's for you.

1:23:06.147 --> 1:23:07.190
[Jonathan] Michelle...

1:23:08.274 --> 1:23:10.068
you have to tell her the truth.

1:23:16.282 --> 1:23:17.367
Michelle.

1:23:19.244 --> 1:23:20.495
Please.
