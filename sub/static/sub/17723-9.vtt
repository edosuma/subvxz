WEBVTT

00:17.951 --> 00:19.284
Dads <i>is recorded in front of</i>
<i>a live studio audience.</i>

00:21.121 --> 00:23.522
Edna...

00:23.524 --> 00:25.324
do you know, uh,
where my receipts are?

00:25.326 --> 00:27.026
¿Que?
Receipts.

00:27.028 --> 00:28.560
The little slips
of paper you get

00:28.562 --> 00:30.863
when you buy things
in a store?

00:30.865 --> 00:33.365
<i>¿Que?</i>

00:33.367 --> 00:34.800
Receipts.

00:34.802 --> 00:36.535
You know, you need 'em
for when you file your taxes.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.871
Taxes...
Yeah.

00:40.306 --> 00:42.875
(laughing)

00:44.244 --> 00:46.912
You funny, Mr. Eli.

00:46.914 --> 00:48.680
Taxes...

00:48.682 --> 00:50.783
(toilet flushes)

00:53.887 --> 00:55.421
Dad, what were you
doing in there?

00:55.423 --> 00:58.357
Short-track
speed-skating.

00:58.359 --> 01:00.192
What do you think
I was doing?

01:00.194 --> 01:01.560
Hey...

01:01.562 --> 01:02.728
where did you
get that?

01:02.730 --> 01:04.263
From one of those
boxes upstairs.

01:04.265 --> 01:05.831
Don't worry, you
got tons of these.

01:05.833 --> 01:06.999
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

01:07.001 --> 01:09.068
This is <i>Freedom League</i>
<i>number 21.</i>

01:09.070 --> 01:12.271
(mocking):
Ooh, it is?

01:12.273 --> 01:13.772
Yes.
This is the first team-up

01:13.774 --> 01:15.107
between the Golden Age
Freedom League

01:15.109 --> 01:17.176
and the Silver Age Freedom
Society of Earth Beta.

01:17.178 --> 01:18.877
Do you have any idea
how much this is worth?

01:18.879 --> 01:21.246
Four years of
high school virginity.

01:24.584 --> 01:26.852
Dad, you cannot bring my comic
books into the bathroom, okay?

01:26.854 --> 01:28.287
They mean a lot to me.

01:29.222 --> 01:31.123
More than I mean to you?

01:35.228 --> 01:36.862
Look, the point is,
if you're going to live here,

01:36.864 --> 01:38.130
you have to
respect my things.

01:38.132 --> 01:40.799
Well, you've got
to respect
my things, buddy.

01:40.801 --> 01:42.134
Buddy?

01:42.136 --> 01:44.703
I blanked on your name
for a minute.

01:47.140 --> 01:49.208
Sorry, Chief.

01:52.278 --> 01:55.781
¶ Daddy took me to the zoo

01:55.783 --> 01:57.783
¶ <i>Na, na, na, na</i> ¶

01:57.785 --> 02:01.787
¶ Just to see
something brand-new ¶

02:01.789 --> 02:03.822
¶ <i>Na, na, na</i> ¶

02:03.824 --> 02:08.060
¶ So many stars up in the sky

02:08.062 --> 02:12.498
¶ So many questions have I

02:12.500 --> 02:14.633
¶ <i>Na, na, na, na</i> ¶

02:14.635 --> 02:17.302
¶ Daddy took me for a ride.

02:20.173 --> 02:21.907
Um, Warner,
I'm not sure about

02:21.909 --> 02:23.075
some of these
write-offs.

02:23.077 --> 02:25.277
Uh, what's this receipt
for a $600 suit?

02:25.279 --> 02:28.147
That was, uh, a business meeting
with a potential investor.

02:28.149 --> 02:29.181
Did he invest?

02:29.183 --> 02:30.983
No, but he, uh...

02:30.985 --> 02:33.452
he said "nice suit."

02:33.454 --> 02:35.954
Well, why would a suit
for you cost that much?

02:35.956 --> 02:39.124
You have the body of
a <i>Price is Right</i> microphone.

02:39.126 --> 02:40.959
I'm not that skinny.

02:40.961 --> 02:42.427
CRAWFORD:
Oh, come on, son.

02:42.429 --> 02:43.829
You were so skinny

02:43.831 --> 02:46.165
your mother didn't know
she was in labor.

02:46.167 --> 02:49.001
She just got up off
the couch and there you were.

02:49.003 --> 02:51.470
Thank God for
plastic slipcovers.

02:51.472 --> 02:53.572
(chuckles)

02:55.675 --> 02:56.942
Hey.

02:56.944 --> 02:58.177
Sorry I'm late, guys.

02:58.179 --> 02:59.811
I had to get all my comics
out of my apartment

02:59.813 --> 03:00.846
and put 'em in a storage unit.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.014
Why would you do that?

03:02.016 --> 03:02.981
I caught my dad

03:02.983 --> 03:04.183
coming out of
the bathroom

03:04.185 --> 03:06.251
reading <i>Freedom League</i> 21.

03:07.320 --> 03:08.453
Wait, that's the first crossover

03:08.455 --> 03:10.155
between the Silver Age
Freedom League

03:10.157 --> 03:11.490
and the Golden Age
Freedom Society...
Golden Age
Freedom Society, yeah.

03:11.492 --> 03:12.491
You had to get them
out of there.
Of course.

03:12.493 --> 03:14.026
You know who'd love working here

03:14.028 --> 03:15.928
is a schoolyard bully.

03:17.630 --> 03:19.331
I love
those comics.
Yeah.

03:19.333 --> 03:20.666
What I would do
to that collection

03:20.668 --> 03:22.034
if I got my hands on it...

03:22.036 --> 03:23.468
Hey, hey, easy.

03:23.470 --> 03:25.137
The first hour,
I'd spread it out

03:25.139 --> 03:27.406
and just stare at it
like a psychopath.

03:27.408 --> 03:29.174
And then I'd

03:29.176 --> 03:31.376
slowly start reading it
and reading it,

03:31.378 --> 03:32.978
and I'd read it harder...

03:32.980 --> 03:34.880
front to back,

03:34.882 --> 03:37.249
back to front...

03:37.251 --> 03:40.185
up against a wall.

03:40.187 --> 03:41.486
No way.

03:41.488 --> 03:42.821
You'd-you'd read it
in two minutes,

03:42.823 --> 03:45.157
apologize, and
just fall asleep.

03:45.159 --> 03:46.692
CRAWFORD:
You're right.

03:46.694 --> 03:47.759
He used to fall asleep

03:47.761 --> 03:49.027
on the couch with his comics

03:49.029 --> 03:50.495
while his mother and I

03:50.497 --> 03:51.763
watched <i>The Cosby Show.</i>

03:51.765 --> 03:53.332
(laughs)

03:53.334 --> 03:55.601
You and your wife watch
a lot of TV together?

03:55.603 --> 03:57.336
Yeah, she told me
she was leaving me

03:57.338 --> 03:58.437
while the Huxtables flushed

03:58.439 --> 04:00.339
Rudy's goldfish down the toilet.

04:03.776 --> 04:04.776
Hey, Warner,

04:04.778 --> 04:06.345
you had a comic book
collection, too?

04:06.347 --> 04:08.614
Yeah, I had...
I had quite the collection.

04:08.616 --> 04:12.084
I had 3,752.

04:12.086 --> 04:13.585
What happened to it?

04:13.587 --> 04:15.120
My dad sold it.
CRAWFORD:
No.

04:15.122 --> 04:16.955
I swapped them.

04:16.957 --> 04:20.359
Remember, those Indians gave us
all those blankets?

04:20.361 --> 04:22.194
We got so sick?

04:22.196 --> 04:23.462
CRAWFORD:
I tried to go back

04:23.464 --> 04:25.464
to the trading post
to reverse the deal,

04:25.466 --> 04:27.366
and it was nothing but
an empty parking lot

04:27.368 --> 04:30.135
and nobody had any idea
what I was talking about.

04:30.137 --> 04:31.403
Of course, at that point,

04:31.405 --> 04:34.873
I was living on Reggie bars
and angel dust.

04:41.214 --> 04:42.247
The kids
are asleep.

04:42.249 --> 04:43.649
Oh, thanks, honey.

04:43.651 --> 04:44.650
(giggles)

04:44.652 --> 04:45.984
What are you wearing?

04:45.986 --> 04:48.220
Oh, I thought I'd just slip into

04:48.222 --> 04:50.789
something a little
more comfortable.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.458
Those are my pants.

04:55.561 --> 04:56.728
Read the label.

04:58.798 --> 05:01.433
"Abigail Landress."

05:01.435 --> 05:03.068
The zipper's on
the hip, there, buddy.

05:03.070 --> 05:05.504
Just like 007.

05:05.506 --> 05:06.805
Okay, well,
why don't you just

05:06.807 --> 05:08.240
take your jeans out of
the laundry basket

05:08.242 --> 05:09.341
and we'll never
speak of this again.

05:09.343 --> 05:10.575
Yep.

05:10.577 --> 05:12.411
Whoa.

05:12.413 --> 05:14.413
Camila, introduce me
to your friend.

05:17.183 --> 05:19.951
Oh...

05:19.953 --> 05:22.087
Hi, son.
I'm sorry.

05:22.089 --> 05:24.523
I'm-I'm just a sucker
for a Landress backside.

05:24.525 --> 05:25.691
(chuckles)

05:25.693 --> 05:26.692
Here, these are for you.

05:26.694 --> 05:28.260
What do you
got there?

05:28.262 --> 05:30.495
Well, take a look.

05:30.497 --> 05:32.197
Oh, my God, Dad,

05:32.199 --> 05:34.032
these are filled
with comics.
Mm-hmm.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.334
Look at this.

05:35.336 --> 05:36.501
<i>X-Men...</i>

05:36.503 --> 05:37.602
Yep.

05:37.604 --> 05:38.537
<i>Superman...</i>

05:38.539 --> 05:40.372
The head cheese.

05:40.374 --> 05:41.840
<i>Batman and Robin...</i>

05:41.842 --> 05:44.843
Top and bottom.

05:44.845 --> 05:48.347
Okay, now you're
starting to suck
all the fun out of it.

05:48.349 --> 05:50.415
Oh, that's a job for Robin.

05:55.321 --> 05:58.790
Yeah, I just felt so bad
that I swapped your comics

05:58.792 --> 06:02.394
with those people who
might be ghosts, and, uh...

06:02.396 --> 06:04.496
I decided to get you
some new ones.

06:04.498 --> 06:05.697
Dad...

06:05.699 --> 06:06.698
this is amazing!
Thank you.

06:06.700 --> 06:07.733
Wh-Where did you
get these?

06:07.735 --> 06:09.334
I computered 'em.

06:09.336 --> 06:11.870
Turns out there is
this guy named Craig

06:11.872 --> 06:13.739
who has this list of
all sorts of stuff

06:13.741 --> 06:15.006
that he sells.

06:15.008 --> 06:16.074
From comics to...

06:16.076 --> 06:18.143
to old furniture, to cars...
Yeah.

06:18.145 --> 06:22.247
And I think he may be
some kind of pimp.

06:25.651 --> 06:28.520
$4,000 for a home
security system?

06:28.522 --> 06:30.155
That's totally a write-off.

06:30.157 --> 06:32.591
I have all kinds of valuable
company assets at home.

06:32.593 --> 06:33.492
Like what?

06:33.494 --> 06:35.594
Like me.

06:36.496 --> 06:38.063
Yeah, ever since he saw <i>Taken,</i>

06:38.065 --> 06:39.197
he's been worried
someone's gonna

06:39.199 --> 06:40.499
drag him out from under his bed

06:40.501 --> 06:42.000
and sell him into
sexual slavery.

06:43.369 --> 06:44.770
Ever since I saw <i>Taken 2,</i>

06:44.772 --> 06:46.838
I've been worried that
it was gonna happen again.

06:48.174 --> 06:50.409
So, are you loving your comics?

06:50.411 --> 06:52.043
Oh, my God, they're so good.

06:52.045 --> 06:53.545
Yeah.

06:53.547 --> 06:54.713
I mean,
I can't wait to show you.

06:54.715 --> 06:56.248
I-I... they're as good as yours.

06:56.250 --> 06:58.850
(laughing):
Okay, come on.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.185
I mean...

07:00.187 --> 07:02.087
slow down there, Tex.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.221
What?

07:03.223 --> 07:04.256
Your dad buys

07:04.258 --> 07:05.690
some cheapo collection
off the Internet

07:05.692 --> 07:06.892
and it's as good as mine?

07:06.894 --> 07:08.193
Come on.

07:08.195 --> 07:10.262
That is some pretty bold talk,
there, fella.

07:10.264 --> 07:12.264
Oh, it's not just talk, partner.

07:12.266 --> 07:13.899
Oh! Oh, is that right?

07:13.901 --> 07:15.066
Yeah.
Oh, okay.

07:15.068 --> 07:16.234
Well, I'll tell you what...

07:16.236 --> 07:18.136
you show me yours,
I'll show you mine.

07:19.539 --> 07:21.873
Wow, this is what it
must've been like

07:21.875 --> 07:24.309
in the Old Gay West.

07:26.212 --> 07:28.814
So we get all my <i>X-Men</i>
<i>from the '70s,</i>

07:28.816 --> 07:30.415
and I'll get all
my   <i>Fantastic Fours...</i>

07:30.417 --> 07:31.750
Ugh, storage units
creep me out.

07:31.752 --> 07:32.884
Why?

07:32.886 --> 07:35.086
Our whole family
lived in one
till I was four.

07:35.088 --> 07:37.722
Well, as long as you were happy.

07:37.724 --> 07:39.424
I wasn't.

07:39.426 --> 07:42.627
Gosh, I'm so glad I don't
come from other places.

07:44.096 --> 07:46.631
(grunting)

07:47.600 --> 07:49.167
(screams)

07:50.570 --> 07:52.003
My comics are gone!

07:52.939 --> 07:54.406
Quiet down!

07:54.408 --> 07:56.074
Yeah!
People trying to sleep!

08:03.516 --> 08:04.783
Now... (sighs)

08:04.785 --> 08:06.117
...were you storing
anything else

08:06.119 --> 08:07.986
besides your cartoons?

08:07.988 --> 08:09.588
Uh, they're comic books.

08:09.590 --> 08:10.689
What did I say?

08:10.691 --> 08:11.990
Oh, you called them cartoons.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.358
God!

08:13.360 --> 08:15.760
I hope they don't take
my badge away for that.

08:15.762 --> 08:17.596
How about you, miss?

08:17.598 --> 08:18.663
Are you his...

08:18.665 --> 08:19.698
(laughs)

08:19.700 --> 08:20.932
No.

08:22.602 --> 08:24.636
Good for you.

08:24.638 --> 08:26.805
Now, aside from
your cartoons,

08:26.807 --> 08:29.274
you say you're missing
several <i>Star Trek</i> lasers?

08:29.276 --> 08:31.843
Uh... phasers.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.011
What's the difference?

08:33.013 --> 08:35.347
Well, a laser is
a focused beam of light,

08:35.349 --> 08:38.517
whereas a phaser is
a directed-energy weapon.

08:38.519 --> 08:39.618
Mm-hmm.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.052
Well, are you gonna

08:41.054 --> 08:42.621
get a forensics team down here

08:42.623 --> 08:44.823
and fingerprint everything
and then get some DNA samples?

08:44.825 --> 08:45.991
Oh, sure.

08:45.993 --> 08:48.793
The <i>Bones</i> lady is
on her way over.

08:48.795 --> 08:51.496
It sounds like
you're being sarcastic.

08:51.498 --> 08:52.631
Not at all.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.132
Well, great. Good.

08:54.134 --> 08:56.468
How... so how long until you
track down these criminals?

08:56.470 --> 08:59.671
Well, once we get
the Bat-Signal in the sky,

08:59.673 --> 09:02.707
things move along
pretty quickly.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.209
See, that...

09:04.211 --> 09:06.678
sounds like you're
being sarcastic again.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.747
But it's not.

09:12.685 --> 09:13.685
This is all

09:13.687 --> 09:16.855
your fault!

09:16.857 --> 09:19.224
Is it me or does he say that

09:19.226 --> 09:21.726
every time he walks in here?

09:21.728 --> 09:23.795
Don't talk to me
like we friends.

09:27.533 --> 09:29.334
All of my comics are gone!

09:29.336 --> 09:30.735
All of them
are gone!

09:30.737 --> 09:33.371
Stolen from the storage unit
that I had to put them in

09:33.373 --> 09:34.906
to keep them from you!

09:34.908 --> 09:36.841
Well, like
I always say,

09:36.843 --> 09:40.679
never put anything
anywhere.

09:40.681 --> 09:42.881
Dad, those comics were

09:42.883 --> 09:45.216
the one happy memory
I had from childhood.

09:45.218 --> 09:46.685
But you had to move in here

09:46.687 --> 09:48.887
and make sure that
even that was ruined, too.

09:48.889 --> 09:50.889
Ask Elizabeth Smart
about her childhood.

09:50.891 --> 09:51.990
See what she says.

09:56.095 --> 09:57.095
EDNA:
Mijo...

09:57.097 --> 09:59.931
I bring for you...

09:59.933 --> 10:02.867
because you lose
your Mickey Mice books.

10:13.779 --> 10:16.615
Is Xbox of Mexico.

10:20.753 --> 10:22.387
So they were
just gone?
Mm-hmm.

10:22.389 --> 10:24.489
God, Eli must be crushed.
Yeah.

10:24.491 --> 10:26.224
He cried.

10:26.226 --> 10:27.826
He did?

10:27.828 --> 10:28.927
Yeah.

10:28.929 --> 10:30.261
The first two minutes
were kind of cute,

10:30.263 --> 10:32.697
Then he got that
snot bubble thing...

10:33.833 --> 10:35.500
WARNER:
Oh, my God, Eli.

10:35.502 --> 10:36.668
I-I can't believe it.

10:36.670 --> 10:37.736
How are you dealing?

10:37.738 --> 10:39.804
I'm day to day.

10:42.575 --> 10:44.175
You know, I never really
cared about crime

10:44.177 --> 10:46.311
until it happened to me.

10:47.680 --> 10:51.116
Well, you-you know,
you're welcome to read my comics

10:51.118 --> 10:52.550
until they find yours.

10:53.519 --> 10:54.919
Really?
Yeah.

10:54.921 --> 10:56.187
Yeah, come on.
Okay.

10:56.189 --> 10:57.956
(grunts)
Wow, you got
a lot.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.491
Yeah.
That's a big box.

10:59.493 --> 11:00.792
(laughing)

11:00.794 --> 11:02.027
Oh.
This is pretty good.
Yeah.

11:02.029 --> 11:03.595
Oh, I had this one.

11:03.597 --> 11:04.763
And this one.

11:04.765 --> 11:06.264
And this one...

11:06.266 --> 11:07.599
and this one...

11:07.601 --> 11:08.767
and this one.

11:12.538 --> 11:14.205
Warner...

11:14.207 --> 11:17.676
I think these might
be my comics.

11:17.678 --> 11:20.512
(laughs)

11:21.714 --> 11:23.314
Wait, wait.

11:23.316 --> 11:27.652
My dad snuck into your storage
space and stole your comics?

11:27.654 --> 11:28.853
I don't...

11:28.855 --> 11:30.855
He can't even get through
a revolving door

11:30.857 --> 11:32.524
without help from somebody.
(laughs)

11:36.128 --> 11:37.128
Dad...
Yeah?

11:37.130 --> 11:38.797
...what was the name
of the guy

11:38.799 --> 11:40.131
you bought these
from online?

11:40.133 --> 11:44.569
Oh, that was
SlobberSausageNine@
lipsmacking.gov

11:44.571 --> 11:46.638
Yeah, he had those
in his trunk,

11:46.640 --> 11:49.808
along with cartons
of cigarettes and sneakers.

11:49.810 --> 11:52.744
In fact,
he sold me these.

11:52.746 --> 11:53.344
Adidos.

11:56.916 --> 11:59.517
Maybe they do belong to you.

11:59.519 --> 12:01.920
Thank you.

12:01.922 --> 12:02.987
Okay,

12:02.989 --> 12:09.094
if you are 100% sure
that these are yours...

12:09.096 --> 12:12.097
I-I can't take them.
I mean, they're...

12:12.099 --> 12:14.332
Well, I mean, I'm not 100%.

12:14.334 --> 12:18.336
They're in a different box
and they're out of order, so...

12:19.572 --> 12:20.939
Well, I can't take them

12:20.941 --> 12:22.440
if you're <i>pretty</i> sure
they're yours, so...

12:22.442 --> 12:23.408
Oh, well...

12:23.410 --> 12:24.809
I'm not...

12:25.711 --> 12:27.779
(laughs)

12:28.948 --> 12:30.415
No, no, no, you don't.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.050
This is Jenna Lacy
all over again.

12:32.052 --> 12:34.719
Jenna Lacy? What does she have
to do with this?

12:34.721 --> 12:37.555
Oh, you don't remember?
Well, I wanted to ask her out,

12:37.557 --> 12:39.124
but I thought that you might
like her,

12:39.126 --> 12:40.558
and so I said,
"Hey, dude, are you

12:40.560 --> 12:42.026
gonna ask her out?"

12:42.028 --> 12:44.896
And you were like,
"No, I don't even like her."

12:44.898 --> 12:46.364
And so I asked her out,

12:46.366 --> 12:48.266
and it turned out
you <i>did</i> like her,

12:48.268 --> 12:50.535
and then you were all, like,
"Hey, I liked her.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.704
Why you asking her out?"

12:52.706 --> 12:55.140
Okay, I'm not gonna take 'em.
Just take 'em.

12:55.142 --> 12:56.541
No, no, I'm not gonna take 'em.

12:56.543 --> 12:57.776
No, I'm not gonna take 'em.

12:57.778 --> 12:59.110
Look, Warner, we've been friends
for 25 years.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.812
I want you to have them.
No, I can't do that.

13:00.814 --> 13:02.213
I'm not gonna take 'em.

13:02.215 --> 13:04.215
Yeah, oh, yeah.
No, don't. No.

13:05.251 --> 13:07.152
Take it. Take it.

13:07.154 --> 13:09.687
Take these.
Take these.

13:11.624 --> 13:15.593
I hope you didn't handle
Jenna Lacy's box that way.

13:15.595 --> 13:18.563
I'll take 'em.
If it'll make you
happy, I'll take 'em.

13:21.267 --> 13:23.301
I have those pants.

13:26.272 --> 13:28.740
I can't believe
he took them.

13:28.742 --> 13:31.943
Well, he did offer
them to you.

13:31.945 --> 13:33.778
Like I always say,

13:33.780 --> 13:35.547
always take everything.

13:37.750 --> 13:38.950
Yeah, well, at least

13:38.952 --> 13:40.251
I didn't learn the difference

13:40.253 --> 13:41.586
between right and wrong
from you.

13:41.588 --> 13:44.222
Oh, yeah? Who'd you learn
it from, Superman?

13:45.157 --> 13:48.293
Yes. And Batman.

13:48.295 --> 13:49.360
And Wonder Woman.

13:49.362 --> 13:51.129
And Aquaman taught me
how to swim,

13:51.131 --> 13:53.064
which is why I cannot swim.

13:56.468 --> 13:58.336
You can't swim?

13:58.338 --> 14:02.640
Boy, your mother really dropped
the ball on that one.

14:02.642 --> 14:06.611
Well, she was busy working
because you weren't around!

14:06.613 --> 14:10.448
God! At least my comic books
were there for me!

14:10.450 --> 14:12.884
At least I could swim!

14:12.886 --> 14:15.019
(door shuts)

14:20.226 --> 14:22.227
What?

14:24.997 --> 14:27.432
Okay, I'm a bad father

14:29.902 --> 14:32.837
And so he had to fill the void

14:32.839 --> 14:35.807
I left in his life
with comic books?

14:38.010 --> 14:40.078
What am I supposed
to do about it?

14:43.749 --> 14:46.618
Go to Warner's
and steal them back?

14:50.089 --> 14:52.757
Well, if you'd shut up
for five seconds,

14:52.759 --> 14:54.893
we could get out of here.

15:07.673 --> 15:09.274
Oh, boy,

15:09.276 --> 15:11.676
Warner's got some
fancy security system.

15:11.678 --> 15:15.480
It's okay, I have password.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.823
Is a good night to die.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.397
Edna, we're just getting
the comic books.

15:32.399 --> 15:34.265
We see how it goes.

15:49.148 --> 15:50.214
Psst!

15:50.216 --> 15:51.616
(hushed):
What are you doing?!

15:51.618 --> 15:53.851
Sorry. Habit!

15:55.054 --> 15:57.188
Edna, let's go upstairs.

16:01.126 --> 16:03.461
All right, we got 'em.
Let's go.

16:03.463 --> 16:04.796
He has more.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.533
All right, all right.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.410
Uh!

16:22.114 --> 16:25.083
You do it wrong!
<i>Estúpido,</i> move!

16:36.128 --> 16:38.229
<i>Andale!</i>

16:42.267 --> 16:44.102
Mama...

16:45.704 --> 16:48.706
(sings Spanish lullaby)

16:58.484 --> 16:59.884
<i>Buenas noches, niño.</i>

17:15.868 --> 17:17.702
CAMILA:
Crawford?

17:23.642 --> 17:26.144
Anyone down here?

17:32.484 --> 17:34.385
(farts)

17:42.494 --> 17:44.228
(sighs)

17:47.166 --> 17:49.333
Whew! Got it.

17:53.205 --> 17:56.007
Okay, so walk me through
the sequence of events again.

17:56.009 --> 18:00.111
Okay, I heard a noise,

18:00.113 --> 18:03.448
I noticed my comics were gone,
I ran downstairs.

18:03.450 --> 18:06.084
It smelled really bad
right here.

18:09.254 --> 18:11.556
I ran outside and noticed

18:11.558 --> 18:13.558
that the security
system's wires were cut.

18:13.560 --> 18:14.559
(knocking)

18:14.561 --> 18:15.693
Hey.
Hey.

18:15.695 --> 18:16.928
I got your message.
Yeah.

18:16.930 --> 18:18.863
Wait a minute. I know you.

18:18.865 --> 18:21.766
I threw your file away
yesterday.

18:21.768 --> 18:25.369
I can't believe somebody broke
in here and stole my comics.

18:27.906 --> 18:30.274
Well, okay, I don't-I don't mean
to be awkward,

18:30.276 --> 18:33.311
but-but you gave 'em to me.
They're-They're my comics.

18:33.313 --> 18:36.247
Well, I mean,
you took them, yes,

18:36.249 --> 18:39.217
but I think we both know
that they are still mine.

18:41.386 --> 18:42.587
Wait a minute.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.255
I think I'm starting
to figure this out.

18:44.257 --> 18:47.325
My comics were the only thing
that were missing, and you

18:47.327 --> 18:50.094
are the only person
that knew they were here.

18:50.096 --> 18:53.164
You stole my comics.
You stole my comics!

18:53.166 --> 18:54.232
Thief!

18:54.234 --> 18:55.900
Arrest him!

18:57.436 --> 19:01.172
No, you are the one
that purchased stolen goods.

19:01.174 --> 19:02.573
So arrest him!

19:03.575 --> 19:06.244
I don't know.
He asked first.

19:06.246 --> 19:09.680
That's usually how
I decide who to arrest.

19:09.682 --> 19:12.116
I bet if we go over
to your apartment right now,

19:12.118 --> 19:13.484
you'll see the comics
right there.

19:13.486 --> 19:14.352
Oh, you do?
Yeah.

19:14.354 --> 19:15.520
How about that?
Yeah, yeah.

19:15.522 --> 19:16.821
Oh, that's great.
Be my guest.

19:16.823 --> 19:17.922
Okay. Aa!
Here we go.

19:17.924 --> 19:19.323
Uh...!

19:19.325 --> 19:21.092
You know, uh...

19:21.094 --> 19:23.861
that Morgan Freeman
is really terrific,
isn't he?

19:34.640 --> 19:38.242
I swear to God, I have no idea
how these got here.

19:42.314 --> 19:43.381
Wait, wait, wait.

19:43.383 --> 19:46.350
He-He-He didn't steal
this nonsense.

19:46.352 --> 19:47.385
We did.

19:47.387 --> 19:49.887
What?

19:49.889 --> 19:51.856
You two care to explain
yourselves?

19:51.858 --> 19:54.091
She farted!

20:01.833 --> 20:04.735
Honey, that-that was you
on the landing?

20:07.172 --> 20:10.341
I, just, I never farted
in front of you before

20:10.343 --> 20:14.912
because I just wanted you
to keep thinking I was perfect.

20:16.148 --> 20:18.716
Well, that's over.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.651
I'm sorry.

20:20.653 --> 20:25.656
I, I never realized how much
you sacrifice for me.

20:28.193 --> 20:30.494
Don't squeeze her
too hard.

20:32.598 --> 20:35.433
Now that the Farty Boys have
solved the case

20:35.435 --> 20:36.901
of the mysterious smell,

20:36.903 --> 20:38.869
can we get back
to the matter at hand?

20:38.871 --> 20:41.239
Whose comics are these?

20:41.241 --> 20:44.041
All right, they're his.

20:44.043 --> 20:46.377
They're ours.

20:46.379 --> 20:47.511
Really?

20:47.513 --> 20:49.680
Yeah. Yeah.

20:49.682 --> 20:51.449
Officer, I'm not gonna press
charges.

20:51.451 --> 20:53.951
That was never
an option for you.

21:00.359 --> 21:02.760
Dad, you stole these for me.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.262
I don't know what to say.

21:04.264 --> 21:06.631
I do.

21:06.633 --> 21:09.867
I didn't realize these
ridiculous men in tights

21:09.869 --> 21:11.435
meant so much to you.

21:12.638 --> 21:16.374
I can see now
why you looked to them

21:16.376 --> 21:17.908
for some kind
of support.

21:17.910 --> 21:21.612
So now that I'm here,
maybe you'll think differently.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.347
I'm sorry, son.

21:25.317 --> 21:27.718
Uh,

21:27.720 --> 21:31.055
it's, like, the first time
I've heard you call me "son".

21:33.225 --> 21:36.193
You blanked on my name again,
didn't you?

21:41.500 --> 21:43.334
Come on. Let's get out of here.

21:43.336 --> 21:45.703
Ma'am, stop right there.

21:47.272 --> 21:49.373
I'm gonna walk ahead of you.

21:56.148 --> 21:58.215
