00:21.355 --> 00:25.317
In 1836, Sarah Hart welcomed

00:25.359 --> 00:28.529
her recently orphaned
12-year-old niece Mary

00:28.571 --> 00:32.073
into her New Haven, Connecticut, home.

00:32.116 --> 00:34.410
Mary's parents had been lost at sea.

00:35.995 --> 00:37.747
Sara and Mary

00:37.788 --> 00:40.207
found solace in each other's company.

00:41.792 --> 00:43.294
As the years passed,

00:43.335 --> 00:45.796
they became inseparable.

00:45.838 --> 00:50.551
It was as if they were
of one mind, one heart.

00:51.802 --> 00:52.928
One morning,

00:52.970 --> 00:54.430
as the two women worked,

00:54.472 --> 00:56.474
Mary collapsed.

00:56.515 --> 00:58.559
The cause wasn't clear.

niece had simply fainted,

but no.

01:06.317 --> 01:08.819
Sara held Mary in her arms

01:08.861 --> 01:10.571
as she took her last breath.

01:13.991 --> 01:16.118
She was buried the next day.

01:20.289 --> 01:23.501

She was convinced

01:42.102 --> 01:43.979
this had to be more than a dream.

01:44.021 --> 01:47.191
Could Mary still be alive?

01:47.233 --> 01:51.153
She begged the church
officials to unearth Mary.

01:51.195 --> 01:54.740
It was a somber task that
quickly turned to horror

01:54.782 --> 01:58.202
when they laid eyes on
Mary's lifeless body...

01:58.244 --> 02:00.663
fingernails torn and bloody,

02:00.704 --> 02:03.749

02:06.335 --> 02:09.170
Her face a horrid death mask.

02:11.924 --> 02:13.884
This really happened to Mary Hart

02:13.926 --> 02:18.097
on October 16, 1872.

02:18.138 --> 02:22.643
Waking up inside a small

02:49.545 --> 02:51.881
One thing we can all be grateful for

02:51.922 --> 02:53.549
is that we live in an age

02:53.591 --> 02:55.676
when we know that dead is dead.

03:08.147 --> 03:10.482
But modern medicine
has redefined the line

03:10.524 --> 03:12.276
between life and death.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.282
We now have control over that line

03:18.324 --> 03:20.326
in a way that previous generations

03:20.367 --> 03:22.202
would have considered miraculous

03:22.244 --> 03:24.455
or the work of the devil.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.542
Doctors routinely stop the heart

03:28.584 --> 03:30.502
during open heart surgery

03:30.544 --> 03:33.714
and then revive the patient
with an electric shock.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.634
People whose brains

03:36.675 --> 03:38.135
have all but ceased to function

03:38.177 --> 03:39.887
can still be kept alive.

03:41.639 --> 03:43.599
Cutting an organ out of one person

03:43.641 --> 03:45.768
and sewing it into the body of another,

03:45.809 --> 03:49.229
that's no longer a notion
out of Frankenstein.

03:51.649 --> 03:54.443
That's what medicine
has always been about...

03:54.485 --> 03:56.820
finding a way to eliminate suffering

03:56.862 --> 03:59.073
and keep death at bay,

03:59.114 --> 04:01.408
even though some early methods

04:01.450 --> 04:03.786
may now seem barbaric.

04:03.827 --> 04:05.621
No matter what the era,

04:05.663 --> 04:08.123
the question has always been,

04:08.165 --> 04:11.293
"How far are we willing to go

04:11.335 --> 04:13.587
to keep a loved one alive?"

04:17.132 --> 04:20.302
In 1883, George Brown found himself

04:20.344 --> 04:23.138
asking that very same question.

04:25.933 --> 04:29.061
Census records tell us that
Brown owned a small farm

04:29.103 --> 04:31.897
in the rural community
of Exeter, Rhode Island.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.732
He had a family, and, like most

04:33.774 --> 04:36.026
if not all of his neighbors,

04:36.068 --> 04:37.403
he was Protestant.

04:40.572 --> 04:43.325
These were people who prided
themselves on hard work,

You've seen how this ends.

06:35.979 --> 06:39.233
In 1883, consumption claimed the lives

06:39.274 --> 06:41.693
of one in four people in New England.

06:43.612 --> 06:46.907
His wife Mary Elizabeth
had contracted the disease

06:46.949 --> 06:49.993
and died an equally agonizing death.

06:51.245 --> 06:53.080
Now it would claim

06:53.122 --> 06:55.415
his oldest daughter Mary Olive.

06:55.457 --> 06:57.084
The newspaper wrote

06:57.126 --> 07:00.129
of the town's sorrow at her passing.

07:00.170 --> 07:02.840
The last hours she lived, they said,

07:02.881 --> 07:04.383
were a great suffering,

07:04.424 --> 07:05.843
yet her faith was firm,

07:05.884 --> 07:08.053
and she was ready for the change.

07:12.057 --> 07:14.393
George was not a religious man,

07:14.434 --> 07:17.271
but he prayed every night
that this terrible sickness

07:17.312 --> 07:19.690
would leave his children alone.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.737

07:25.779 --> 07:28.574
that consumption continued
to plague New Englanders.

But for nine years,

07:32.077 --> 07:34.163
George's prayers were answered,

07:34.204 --> 07:35.998
and his family was spared.

This time it came for Mercy.

10:39.264 --> 10:41.975
The pandemic had
reached epic proportions,

10:42.017 --> 10:45.729
and after enduring the ravages
of such a brutal disease,

10:45.771 --> 10:48.857
the last remaining shred
of hope was that death

10:48.899 --> 10:50.901
would finally bring relief.

10:56.239 --> 10:59.785
But only if the dead were actually dead.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.090
At this time in the late 19th century,

11:13.131 --> 11:17.969
pronouncing someone dead was
more guess work than science.

11:18.011 --> 11:22.015
The fear of premature burial
HAD A NAME: Tapephobia.

11:22.057 --> 11:25.852
And thus the birth of
the Waiting Mortuary,

11:25.894 --> 11:28.313
the place where the probably,

11:28.355 --> 11:32.484
but maybe not completely
dead could be observed.

11:32.526 --> 11:35.445
That is until the only
sure fire sign of death

11:35.487 --> 11:38.448
PRESENTED ITSELF: putrefaction.

establishments were adorned

11:41.785 --> 11:45.038

to mask the stench.

Still, why wait that long
if you didn't have to?

11:48.792 --> 11:50.669
There were a growing
number of techniques

11:50.710 --> 11:54.005
that could provide a speedier verdict,

11:54.047 --> 11:57.717
like sticking a pin under the nail bed.

11:57.759 --> 12:01.930
Putting a live beetle in the ear.

12:19.948 --> 12:22.492
For those with sufficient means,

12:22.534 --> 12:24.202
there was another option,

12:24.244 --> 12:26.580
the safety coffin.

12:26.621 --> 12:28.457
Enterprising inventors,

12:28.498 --> 12:30.834
embracing the zeitgeist of the moment,

12:30.876 --> 12:32.502
proposed numerous patents

12:32.544 --> 12:35.881
for this emerging class
of mortuary product.

12:35.922 --> 12:39.259
One popular design
consisted of a long tube

12:39.301 --> 12:43.180
that provided light and fresh air.

12:43.221 --> 12:45.765
One doctor designed
a system using a bell.

12:45.807 --> 12:48.268
Strings were attached to the hands,

12:48.310 --> 12:50.312
feet, and head of the corpse,

12:50.353 --> 12:53.064
and if the bell rang,
the attendant would

12:53.106 --> 12:54.649
summon the gravediggers,

12:54.691 --> 12:56.651
who'd rapidly reverse their labor,

12:56.693 --> 13:00.697
freeing the occupant from
his terrifying predicament.

13:00.739 --> 13:04.784
Hence the expression,
"Saved by the bell."

13:07.204 --> 13:11.249
The thing is, we'll never know
just how many woke in terror

13:11.291 --> 13:13.460
only to die a second death.

it... it gets into
the body of a loved one

and it kills them,

15:57.999 --> 15:59.793

back from the grave

15:59.834 --> 16:01.419
to feast on the blood of the next

I let my wife and

Since the demon spirit resides
in the heart of the diseased,

NARRATOR: George Brown was being
asked to do the unthinkable:

19:21.578 --> 19:24.122
exhume the bodies of his family to see

19:24.163 --> 19:28.167
if they were, in a way, still alive.

19:31.045 --> 19:32.755
It was a ritual with a name.

19:35.049 --> 19:38.094
Therapeutic exhumation.

19:38.136 --> 19:41.055
To ensure that the
dead were really dead.

19:41.097 --> 19:44.851
The idea was born some
hundred years earlier

19:44.893 --> 19:47.103
from the work of George Stahl,

19:47.145 --> 19:50.148
one of Germany's most respected doctors.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.609
Stahl was obsessed with understanding

19:52.650 --> 19:55.278
what separated life from death.

19:55.320 --> 19:57.488
He believed that an invisible life force

19:57.530 --> 20:00.408
flowed through the human body...

20:00.450 --> 20:02.785
and this force keeps
the lungs breathing,

20:02.827 --> 20:06.331
the heart beating, the blood liquid.

20:06.372 --> 20:09.167
He called that force the animus...

20:09.208 --> 20:12.086
the soul.

20:12.128 --> 20:14.380
Decomposition could only begin

20:14.422 --> 20:18.801
once the soul had left the body.

20:18.843 --> 20:22.555
But we now know that Stahl had it wrong.

20:22.597 --> 20:25.558
But people back then thought
it was cutting-edge science,

20:25.600 --> 20:29.103
and used it to justify
their own superstitions...

20:29.145 --> 20:33.441
that some souls remain in their corpses.

20:33.483 --> 20:35.360
And to sustain themselves,

20:35.401 --> 20:38.488
those souls feed on the living,

20:38.529 --> 20:42.367
spreading disease as they feast.

20:42.408 --> 20:46.579
This strange combination
of bad science and folklore

20:46.621 --> 20:49.415
was brought to America
by German Army surgeons

20:49.457 --> 20:53.336

the American Revolution.

20:53.378 --> 20:56.255
When a town was plagued by Consumption,

20:56.297 --> 20:58.549
they would exhume the corpses.

20:58.591 --> 21:02.387
If they discovered flesh that
hadn't decomposed sufficiently

21:02.428 --> 21:04.931
or blood that hadn't coagulated,

21:04.973 --> 21:07.350
it could mean only one thing:

21:07.392 --> 21:11.896
the soul was still trapped in the body.

21:11.938 --> 21:16.859
The heart would be surgically
removed and cremated.

21:16.901 --> 21:21.030
Thus the soul would be put
to rest once and for all.
