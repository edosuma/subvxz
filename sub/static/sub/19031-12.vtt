WEBVTT

00:01.301 --> 00:02.495
Four months into med school,

00:02.535 --> 00:04.594
and we were getting
on each other's nerves.

00:04.637 --> 00:06.434
Cole was especially good at it.

00:06.473 --> 00:08.634
Cole, you're wearing my scrubs.

00:08.675 --> 00:10.472
I had to wear the ones
my mom made me.

00:11.678 --> 00:14.943
Babe, you know girl scrubs
make my ass pop.

00:14.981 --> 00:16.744
That is so stupid.

00:16.783 --> 00:18.774
Damn, Mama wants a bite!

00:19.619 --> 00:21.211
You know, Cole,

00:21.254 --> 00:23.620
you could be a little more respectful
of other people.

00:23.656 --> 00:27.456
Fine. Maya, that is a lovely sweater.

00:27.494 --> 00:29.758
It really shows everybody
what you're working with.

00:30.363 --> 00:32.024
There, Luce. You happy?

00:32.098 --> 00:34.066
- Ow! What was that for?
- I don't know.

00:34.100 --> 00:35.397
I assume you did something stupid.

00:35.435 --> 00:36.993
- Did he?
- Yeah.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.402
One more for luck.

00:38.438 --> 00:39.871
All right, fall in, losers.

00:39.906 --> 00:42.534
Today, one of you is gonna get
an amazing learning opportunity.

00:42.609 --> 00:45.169
Trang, I need you to put a new gown
on Mrs. Gainer.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.907
Be careful.
She's off her meds, has four-inch nails,

00:47.947 --> 00:50.040
and is convinced
someone's trying to steal her skin.

00:50.450 --> 00:52.611
Hey, Talking Man Baby, come here.

00:54.187 --> 00:56.781
I am parked
in the 10-minute parking zone.

00:56.823 --> 01:00.054
- You want me to move your car?
- No, I love the space.

01:00.093 --> 01:02.220
What I want you to do is to pull out of

01:02.262 --> 01:05.025
and then back into the space
every 10 minutes.

01:05.065 --> 01:08.398
If you get bored, here's a ball
and a half a deck of cards.

01:08.435 --> 01:09.868
I want that ball.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.201
Trang, get over here right now.

01:12.238 --> 01:13.296
I didn't envy Trang.

01:13.339 --> 01:16.274
At some point, we'd all been caught
between Dr. Mahoney and Dr. Cox,

01:16.309 --> 01:18.777
and it felt like being
in a pinball machine.

01:25.485 --> 01:28.579
And it always ended the same way,
with Dr. Cox winning.

01:28.621 --> 01:32.057
Tiny One, run fast now.

01:37.764 --> 01:39.026
Dr. Kelso?

01:39.065 --> 01:42.557
I told you, you can't be coming up
in here stealing all the gauze.

01:42.602 --> 01:43.967
Are you building a giant gauze ball?

01:44.003 --> 01:45.868
'Cause if you are, I want in.
It's on my bucket list.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.233
Actually, I'm here for a medical reason.

01:48.274 --> 01:49.502
I had a bit of a scare

01:49.542 --> 01:52.943
while I was playing a game
of Scattergories with my niece.

01:52.979 --> 01:54.139
You're still on the clock.

01:54.180 --> 01:56.273
She means the Scattergories clock.

01:56.316 --> 01:58.284
She's very competitive.

01:58.351 --> 02:01.809
Anyway, I got a little bit light-headed,
and so we're gonna run some tests.

02:01.855 --> 02:03.220
I wouldn't worry about it.

02:03.256 --> 02:06.054
A few years back,
I got a little light-headed myself.

02:06.092 --> 02:07.320
Turns out it was...

02:08.627 --> 02:10.960
Well, it was diabetes.
That's a bad example.

02:10.997 --> 02:12.965
You'll be fine. You'll be fine.

02:14.701 --> 02:16.032
What up, Dr. T?

02:16.069 --> 02:19.402
Okay, today, as part
of your practical doctoring class,

02:19.439 --> 02:22.306
we'll be conducting physical exams
on one another for the first time.

02:22.342 --> 02:23.570
Cole.

02:24.210 --> 02:26.178
Put your pants back on.

02:26.713 --> 02:30.774
My bad. I thought this was going
somewhere totally different.

02:30.817 --> 02:34.412
People, I said it day one,
I can't teach you without your pants on.

02:35.054 --> 02:37.420
While doing these exams,
some of you may experience

02:37.457 --> 02:39.584
something we like to call
Med Student Syndrome.

02:40.026 --> 02:41.254
It's a common condition

02:41.294 --> 02:44.593
where med students think they have
the disease they're studying.

02:44.631 --> 02:46.496
All right, what I want you all
to do now, though,

02:46.533 --> 02:49.934
is partner up with the person
next to you and get it cracking.

02:50.003 --> 02:54.269
Getting paired up in med school
was like playing a game of win,

02:54.307 --> 02:56.741
lose, or Frank.

02:56.776 --> 03:00.473
Spoiler alert. My skin's super flaky.

03:00.513 --> 03:03.243
Man, I just got totally Frank'd.

03:03.683 --> 03:06.675
I really appreciate you taking time
to check me out.

03:06.719 --> 03:09.085
I'm gonna take care of you,
but first, as you know,

03:09.122 --> 03:11.420
we got to knock out
one of these patient histories.

03:11.457 --> 03:13.084
And we both know how weird
these can get.

03:13.126 --> 03:15.060
Yes, deeply, deeply weird.

03:15.094 --> 03:16.584
What do you say we just dive right in?

03:16.629 --> 03:19.257
Are you currently taking
any medications?

03:19.299 --> 03:21.529
Have you had sex
with multiple partners?

03:21.568 --> 03:23.058
You exercising regularly?

03:23.102 --> 03:24.729
And have you traveled
outside the United States

03:24.771 --> 03:25.863
in the last couple months?

03:25.905 --> 03:28.169
Yes. Hell, yes.

03:28.208 --> 03:31.837
Yes, I go to the bathroom 10 times
a day, which for me is cardio.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.573
- Natch.
- I recently flew

03:33.613 --> 03:36.912
to Bangkok,
but I didn't actually get off the plane.

03:37.617 --> 03:38.675
Right.

03:39.452 --> 03:42.216
That little stunt you pulled with Trang?
Not cool.

03:42.255 --> 03:43.620
I needed him for real hospital work.

03:43.656 --> 03:45.920
Having him move my car,
I'll have you know,

03:45.959 --> 03:48.484
was hospital work of the highest order.

03:48.561 --> 03:50.358
That's exactly what Trang needed.

03:50.396 --> 03:52.261
Driving back and forth
in the parking lot,

03:52.298 --> 03:55.028
reinforcing every stereotype
of Asian drivers.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.434
Look, you're the one
who put me with the med students,

03:57.470 --> 04:00.030
so don't undermine me.
Who's in charge of them, you or me?

04:00.073 --> 04:02.507
I'm in charge of you,
and by the transitive property,

04:02.542 --> 04:05.033
anybody you're in charge of,
I'm also in charge of.

04:05.078 --> 04:08.013
You see, I'm the boss around here.
I can pretty much do whatever I want.

04:08.047 --> 04:11.107
For instance,
I can use the intercom to whistle.

04:11.150 --> 04:12.947
Any loose change, automatically mine.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.749
And I never have to buy chocolate bars

04:14.787 --> 04:16.652
from any of my colleagues'
awful children

04:16.689 --> 04:18.884
to support their horrible school bands.

04:18.925 --> 04:21.894
I can do whatever I want,
and you just have to stand and nod

04:21.928 --> 04:25.455
like the sweet-mouthed little man-boy,
monkey toy that you truly are.

04:26.799 --> 04:27.823
Mine.

04:27.867 --> 04:28.959
Ugh!

04:29.969 --> 04:31.197
Leave.

04:33.072 --> 04:36.200
Even though Dr. Turk warned us
about Med Student Syndrome,

04:36.242 --> 04:37.709
we couldn't help ourselves.

04:37.744 --> 04:40.872
Dr. Turk, I've got scurvy and rickets.

04:40.913 --> 04:42.744
How did I get all the pirate diseases?

04:42.782 --> 04:46.650
That's a walk in the park
compared to my early-onset dementia.

04:47.453 --> 04:48.715
Where's my phone?

04:48.755 --> 04:51.189
Actually, Cole does have
a weird mole on his chest.

04:51.224 --> 04:55.456
Man, forget that mole. I'm more
worried about the pain in my throat.

04:55.895 --> 04:57.522
The T-Pain.

05:02.502 --> 05:07.496
Listen, guys, calm down. You're all fine.
Everything's good.

05:07.540 --> 05:10.998
That's a bruise, you're just ticklish,
and you, my friend,

05:11.044 --> 05:12.204
you got ink on your tongue.

05:12.245 --> 05:15.737
Stop eating your pens.
Cole, the mole on your chest...

05:16.716 --> 05:19.651
Well, actually, the mole on your chest
is something we need to check out.

05:20.219 --> 05:23.279
So, Cole,

05:23.323 --> 05:26.850
unfortunately, the biopsy shows
that your mole is malignant.

05:26.893 --> 05:28.451
You have melanoma.

05:28.494 --> 05:31.258
Skin cancer? Oh, my God, Cole.

05:35.301 --> 05:36.529
How'd you know
it was gonna be malignant?

05:36.569 --> 05:38.833
I didn't. I was prepared for both ways.

05:40.000 --> 05:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:56.923 --> 05:59.585
Cole's cancer thing
was really freaking me out.

05:59.625 --> 06:02.526
Hey, check it,
I put orange soda in my IV bag.

06:02.562 --> 06:04.120
I'm like a hamster, yo.

06:04.163 --> 06:05.892
Cole, not so much.

06:06.132 --> 06:08.623
This is serious. You have cancer.

06:08.668 --> 06:11.728
Lucy, it's not cancer cancer.

06:11.771 --> 06:13.398
Hey, that kind of cancer is for uglies

06:13.439 --> 06:15.634
and dudes who keep laptops
on their balls.

06:18.511 --> 06:21.480
Well, then, Bob-O, I figured out
what's causing the fainting.

06:21.514 --> 06:24.847
Men don't faint.
We take unintended, decisive naps.

06:24.884 --> 06:27.444
It's just vagal syncope.
Nothing to worry about.

06:27.487 --> 06:28.681
That's a relief.

06:28.721 --> 06:32.487
So, just fill my prescription
for blue steel and I'll be on my way.

06:32.525 --> 06:33.958
There is one other thing.

06:33.993 --> 06:37.759
Unfortunately, given your age
and your current insurance regulations,

06:37.797 --> 06:40.027
they're not gonna let you
drive anymore.

06:40.333 --> 06:43.427
That's crazy. I'm a great driver.

06:46.205 --> 06:51.336
Hey, what's up? Nothing.
I was just about to grab some yogurt.

06:53.646 --> 06:57.343
I guess I can bum rides.
It's good, actually.

06:57.383 --> 06:59.214
You don't know how many times

06:59.252 --> 07:02.881
I've been out late
and had to pass on that seventh drink.

07:02.989 --> 07:04.547
No more Mr. Responsible.

07:09.262 --> 07:12.322
- What about him? How's he gonna die?
- Red nose, beer gut.

07:12.365 --> 07:13.696
- Definitely liver failure.
- No way.

07:13.733 --> 07:15.030
Check out his shirt
and his callused hands.

07:15.067 --> 07:16.466
He probably works around
a lot of machinery.

07:16.502 --> 07:18.367
I'm thinking nail gun to the head.

07:18.404 --> 07:20.065
You said that about the nurse
who just walked by.

07:20.106 --> 07:22.540
I think you're overestimating how many
people actually own nail guns.

07:22.575 --> 07:23.735
Whatever. That's how I want to go.

07:26.512 --> 07:27.570
- Hello.
- Number One,

07:27.647 --> 07:30.707
I need you to prep some forms
for Dr. Kelso,

07:30.750 --> 07:32.911
get the notes for today's lecture
out of my office

07:32.952 --> 07:36.547
and set my DVR to record
Big Bang Theory.

07:36.589 --> 07:39.683
The whole world is watching this thing
and I've got to know why.

07:39.926 --> 07:43.259
I got to go. Dr. Cox needs me
to do a bunch of stuff.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.821
Cox? You're leaving me for Cox,
right now?

07:45.865 --> 07:49.961
- Yeah, is that all right?
- No, yeah, that's fine. Go.

07:51.237 --> 07:54.138
It's just all this talk
about, you know, dying

07:54.173 --> 07:57.870
is making me think
about my childhood dog, Rascal

07:58.811 --> 08:00.039
Flats Paws.

08:00.079 --> 08:02.206
You had a dog
named Rascal Flats Paws?

08:02.248 --> 08:03.647
It's an Indian name, okay?

08:03.683 --> 08:06.379
We got him from
a Navajo rescue center.

08:07.086 --> 08:09.179
I taught him how to skateboard.
He was really good,

08:09.222 --> 08:11.315
until my dad ran him over.

08:12.024 --> 08:14.959
- Bastard did it on purpose.
- Wait, are you screwing with me?

08:14.994 --> 08:16.791
Yeah, Drew. That's what I do.

08:16.829 --> 08:19.798
I make up stories about my dead,
skateboarding Indian dog

08:19.832 --> 08:22.767
and my abusive father
just to mess with you. That...

08:22.802 --> 08:24.167
Yeah.

08:24.470 --> 08:26.199
What, just forget it.

08:27.206 --> 08:28.366
Uh...

08:30.343 --> 08:33.210
No, it's fine. I'll stay.

08:34.746 --> 08:36.339
After our examinations yesterday,

08:36.381 --> 08:39.078
we discovered a malignant melanoma
on Cole's chest.

08:39.118 --> 08:42.349
He's been generous enough to let us
use his case as a teaching tool.

08:42.388 --> 08:45.983
- Mmm! Hear that? I'm a tool, yo.
- Pal...

08:46.058 --> 08:48.925
Drew, he's sick. Let's just let it slide.

08:50.863 --> 08:53.832
This slide is a magnified image
of Cole's mole.

08:53.866 --> 08:55.834
How is it different from a benign one?

08:55.868 --> 08:57.426
Well, it's dark with undefined edges.

08:57.470 --> 08:59.131
You're dark with undefined edges.

08:59.171 --> 09:01.537
- That doesn't even make any sense.
- You don't make sense.

09:01.574 --> 09:03.508
Okay, you know what?
We'll just move on to the questions.

09:03.543 --> 09:07.343
Dr. Turk, doesn't melanoma sometimes
spread into the lymph nodes?

09:07.380 --> 09:10.247
Well, they caught it early,
so that's an extreme scenario.

09:10.917 --> 09:13.010
You're an extreme scenario.

09:13.052 --> 09:15.714
I'm sorry, Dr. T.
He just keeps setting me up.

09:16.455 --> 09:19.288
Thanks again, Turkleton,
for giving me the lift.

09:19.325 --> 09:22.294
Hitching rides with students
was not working out.

09:22.328 --> 09:27.664
The constant stops at keg parties
and strip clubs, they just weren't into it.

09:27.700 --> 09:31.830
But, hey, nobody hustles Bob Kelso
out of the champagne room.

09:31.871 --> 09:33.964
That is my house.

09:34.006 --> 09:36.873
If I even step into the parking lot
of a strip club, Carla,

09:36.909 --> 09:38.774
she can pick up the scent of glitter

09:38.811 --> 09:41.780
and vanilla body wash
like nobody's business.

09:41.814 --> 09:43.577
I'm telling you,
it's like she's a stripper bloodhound.

09:43.616 --> 09:45.447
Well, I got to get home early anyway.

09:45.484 --> 09:48.351
I want to read the Internet
before they take it down.

09:48.387 --> 09:50.821
I'm not exactly sure
that's how that works, sir.

09:50.856 --> 09:52.289
- Damn.
- What?

09:52.325 --> 09:55.488
I talked through my taco.
I totally forgot to savor it.

09:55.528 --> 09:59.624
I'm gonna go get another one.
I'll be back in five minutes, okay?

09:59.799 --> 10:03.496
You know what? 10 minutes.
Line looks kind of long.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.538
I know you think this surgery
is no big deal,

10:06.572 --> 10:08.870
but are you sure
you don't want your parents there?

10:08.908 --> 10:10.102
Yeah, I'm good.

10:10.142 --> 10:12.269
And besides, they're on some bike trip
around Iceland

10:12.311 --> 10:15.542
taking pictures of puffins,
whatever the hell those are.

10:15.581 --> 10:18.106
What about your boys?
I could give them a call for you.

10:18.150 --> 10:20.311
Nah. Topher and Boots
are on house arrest

10:20.353 --> 10:23.413
for getting into a fight with Criss Angel
at a porn convention.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.923
Sounded awesome.

10:24.957 --> 10:27.983
I could at least make sure
our study group is there.

10:28.027 --> 10:30.120
- Those fools?
- They're your friends.

10:30.162 --> 10:31.891
They want to be there for you.

10:32.064 --> 10:34.259
All right, I guess it's cool if they come.

10:34.300 --> 10:37.235
Oh, sweet. Cancer party!

10:37.269 --> 10:41.706
Like, tons of my uncles died of cancer,
so I know exactly how to do this.

10:41.874 --> 10:44.536
But theirs were sad.
This one's gonna be fun.

10:45.144 --> 10:47.635
Number One, just exactly
what in the hell happened?

10:47.680 --> 10:50.148
You didn't do any of the stuff
that I asked you to.

10:50.182 --> 10:52.980
I'm sorry.
Denise was going through something.

10:53.019 --> 10:54.543
I was in a really emotional place.

10:54.587 --> 10:56.953
Let me see if I've got this straight,
Dr. Mahoney.

10:56.989 --> 10:58.980
You, who think that women in labor

10:59.025 --> 11:01.255
need to cool it
on the emotional theatrics,

11:01.293 --> 11:04.751
suddenly became a needy girlfriend
at the exact same moment

11:04.797 --> 11:06.321
that I required Number One's help?

11:06.365 --> 11:08.333
- What's going on here?
- I'll tell you what's going on here.

11:08.367 --> 11:12.167
This one thinks that just because
you're having emotionless intercourse,

11:12.204 --> 11:15.935
that you are the one med student
who will listen to her over me.

11:15.975 --> 11:17.169
Sweetie, ignore him.

11:17.209 --> 11:19.541
I need you to take a patient
to get an MRI.

11:19.578 --> 11:22.411
And I need you to prepare slides
for the immunology exam.

11:22.448 --> 11:25.315
The one thing I know for sure
is that Drew is not gonna sacrifice

11:25.351 --> 11:26.716
his entire medical career

11:26.752 --> 11:29.983
for the steely caress
of your cold robot pincers.

11:30.456 --> 11:31.923
Well, let's let him choose.

11:31.957 --> 11:33.151
Fine. Drew?

11:38.564 --> 11:40.828
Hey, Bob,
I am so sorry to keep you waiting.

11:40.866 --> 11:42.663
I've been dancing
as fast as I can up there,

11:42.702 --> 11:45.068
but I just need 15 more minutes
to see another patient

11:45.104 --> 11:47.072
- and we will get out of here.
- Take your time.

11:47.106 --> 11:50.269
It's already been 10 minutes,
what's 15 more?

11:50.309 --> 11:52.038
Why don't you just go inside
and have yourself a seat?

11:52.078 --> 11:55.241
A nice, warm seat
for the old-timer, huh? Gee, thanks.

11:55.281 --> 11:56.578
Will there be an afghan?

11:56.615 --> 11:59.015
I don't want to get a draft
while I'm doing the jumble

11:59.051 --> 12:01.349
and clipping articles
to send to my grandchildren.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.150
I appreciate that you're frustrated.

12:03.189 --> 12:06.056
Not being able to drive,
losing your independence.

12:06.092 --> 12:08.390
It's got to be pretty hard on you.

12:08.427 --> 12:10.224
What the hell you talking about?

12:10.262 --> 12:14.198
Look, Perry, just because we had
a couple of nice conversations

12:14.233 --> 12:16.064
and a few backyard beers last summer,

12:16.102 --> 12:18.832
it doesn't mean
we're Butch and Sundance, all right?

12:18.871 --> 12:22.807
So, just forget all this soulmate stuff
and just go bring the car around.

12:22.842 --> 12:25.902
You know what, Bob?
Find your own way home.

12:29.415 --> 12:31.975
Hey. Guys, I wanted to talk to you
about something.

12:32.017 --> 12:33.348
You want us to go to Cole's surgery?

12:33.385 --> 12:34.443
How did you know?

12:34.487 --> 12:35.545
It's written on your hand.

12:37.790 --> 12:40.486
- I've been forgetting things recently.
- You should eat more grains.

12:40.526 --> 12:42.721
You know, I was just thinking
that exact...

12:43.596 --> 12:44.756
Oh.

12:45.531 --> 12:47.658
So, can I count on you all to be there?

12:47.700 --> 12:50.260
Why? He never supports us.

12:50.302 --> 12:53.100
Yeah, last month I ran a charity 5K.

12:53.405 --> 12:55.396
But when I asked Cole for a donation,

12:55.441 --> 12:57.534
he burped in my face
and told me it was for the kids.

12:57.576 --> 12:59.737
But it would mean a lot to him
if you guys were there.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.247
Really? Because every time
I ask him how he is,

13:02.281 --> 13:04.476
he shows me his abs and says,
"Ask them."

13:04.817 --> 13:07.342
Look, if you don't want to do it for him,
then do it for me.

13:07.386 --> 13:11.686
And if you don't want to do it for me,
then do it for the cupcakes I'll bring.

13:11.757 --> 13:12.815
Maybe.

13:12.858 --> 13:15.588
I tried to make sure
Cole wouldn't be alone,

13:15.628 --> 13:18.222
although, for some,
solitude can be a relief.

13:18.264 --> 13:19.697
Have you seen Drew Suffin?

13:19.732 --> 13:22.701
Med student, but, like, 900 years old?

13:23.202 --> 13:25.397
Hey, you seen a med student,
thinks he's way cooler than he is,

13:25.437 --> 13:27.302
kind of has a serial killer vibe?

13:28.774 --> 13:32.403
But sometimes it can remind you
of a growing frustration.

13:35.214 --> 13:38.650
And even if you think
you're just fine on your own,

13:40.085 --> 13:42.053
you can feel surprisingly abandoned.

13:42.087 --> 13:44.783
I thought you said people were coming.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.090
Cupcake?

13:55.301 --> 13:56.529
Hey, where did you go?

13:56.569 --> 13:59.197
I went to the campus store
and got some things to cheer you up.

13:59.238 --> 14:02.571
Like a Winston University mini-fan

14:02.608 --> 14:05.509
because the surgery
is gonna be a breeze,

14:06.712 --> 14:08.680
a license plate frame

14:08.714 --> 14:12.241
because you are gonna drive away
that cancer,

14:12.284 --> 14:16.243
and a stuffed Ollie the Owlcat

14:16.322 --> 14:19.587
because you are gonna
hoot, hoot, hoot...

14:19.625 --> 14:22.526
Actually, I just really think he's cute.
Can I have him?

14:22.561 --> 14:25.860
- Whatever. Keep it.
- Look, it's not all bad.

14:25.898 --> 14:27.593
I'm here. We have cupcakes.

14:27.633 --> 14:30.534
We can lie in bed
and watch TV all day.

14:30.569 --> 14:34.198
No, the remote's broken
and it's stuck on the History Channel.

14:34.240 --> 14:36.401
Okay, I don't care about stuff
that's already happened.

14:37.109 --> 14:38.940
I'm really sorry no one came.

14:38.978 --> 14:41.811
Yeah, I was fine without anyone,
but you had to promise.

14:41.847 --> 14:44.714
You had to do the whole Lucy thing
of "They'll come.

14:44.750 --> 14:47.776
"They'll listen to me.
I think horses should go into space."

14:47.853 --> 14:49.514
I never said that.

14:49.555 --> 14:53.013
Why would I want fewer horses
on Earth? That's crazy.

14:53.058 --> 14:55.356
What's crazy is thinking
that you could cheer me up.

14:55.394 --> 14:57.794
You know,
that is just the kind of jerky thing

14:57.830 --> 14:59.923
that makes people
not want to be there for you.

14:59.965 --> 15:03.025
Well, I don't need them
and I don't need you, either.

15:03.068 --> 15:06.333
Okay, so take your cupcakes
and your license plate frame,

15:06.372 --> 15:07.862
leave the mini-fan and go.

15:08.874 --> 15:10.205
Whatever you want.

15:12.144 --> 15:14.942
Come on, Lucy! Judge Mathis?

15:15.915 --> 15:18.213
Med student who was supposed
to pick me up never showed up.

15:18.250 --> 15:21.083
- I've been out there forever.
- What do you want from me?

15:22.154 --> 15:25.317
Help me out with this paperwork thing
so I can drive again.

15:25.391 --> 15:28.383
It's just some stupid insurance rule.

15:28.427 --> 15:30.361
That's a pretty big favor there, Bob.

15:30.396 --> 15:33.194
And since, according to you,
we're not real friends,

15:33.232 --> 15:34.859
which makes perfect sense,

15:34.900 --> 15:37.664
as your only real friends
are a bottle of discount gin

15:37.703 --> 15:39.068
and the metal handrail in your shower,

15:39.104 --> 15:42.267
I'm gonna go ahead and say no.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.976
We got to pass.
What are you doing here?

15:47.012 --> 15:49.776
- I got a text from Drew.
- Yeah, me, too.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.947
What's going on? You texted
me that a patient's coding in here.

15:55.988 --> 15:58.718
You texted me,
"Come and show me your boobs"?

15:58.757 --> 16:01.726
I may have switched those texts.

16:01.760 --> 16:04.627
Which does raise the question,
why did you show up then, Dr. Cox?

16:08.734 --> 16:09.996
Dr. Kelso?

16:10.069 --> 16:12.060
Sorry, son.
I came in to use the bathroom

16:12.104 --> 16:13.230
while you were sleeping.

16:13.272 --> 16:16.435
But I've been watching TV
for the last 45 minutes.

16:16.475 --> 16:20.434
Yeah, I got caught up in this article
about how they make tortillas.

16:20.479 --> 16:22.413
There's a lot of steps.

16:22.948 --> 16:24.609
What're you in for?

16:24.650 --> 16:26.345
I got the cancer.

16:26.452 --> 16:27.578
Woof.

16:27.619 --> 16:30.417
I'll tell you what'll make you feel better.

16:30.456 --> 16:33.016
Giving an old man your pudding cup.

16:36.595 --> 16:40.087
Listen, for reasons I don't understand,
probably related

16:40.132 --> 16:42.965
to childhood memories of my father
dressed up like my mother

16:43.002 --> 16:45.596
screaming,
"Am I pretty? Am I pretty? Am I pretty?"

16:45.637 --> 16:48.265
You two are my closest relationships
in this place.

16:48.307 --> 16:53.335
Congratulations. But I cannot handle
being stuck in the middle of you guys.

16:53.379 --> 16:54.573
You have got to work it out.

16:54.613 --> 16:58.049
You brought us here to make us talk?
That's ridiculous.

16:58.083 --> 17:00.278
About as ridiculous
as your five-o'clock shadow.

17:00.319 --> 17:03.811
Honest to God, there are some times
during rounds when I look over at you,

17:03.856 --> 17:06.119
and it's like I'm teaching Yasir Arafat.

17:06.157 --> 17:08.819
Really? I see a slightly gayer
George Michael.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.886
- Oh! So see that.
- Mmm.

17:10.929 --> 17:13.295
Could you please be more alike?

17:16.001 --> 17:17.525
You know, we are kind of alike.

17:17.569 --> 17:21.403
Actually, a lot of my best moves
I learned from watching you.

17:21.540 --> 17:24.099
Remember when you gave Maya
that two-page list of careers

17:24.143 --> 17:26.270
she'd be more suited for
than medicine?

17:26.310 --> 17:27.436
She cried for the entire weekend.

17:27.780 --> 17:32.581
Really? Gosh, you hope you reach
these kids, but you never know.

17:32.618 --> 17:34.449
You just never know.

17:40.959 --> 17:44.554
Sorry your mom couldn't make it.
She's a hell of a woman.

17:44.963 --> 17:47.830
Next time you see her,
tell her that Bob Kelso said,

17:47.866 --> 17:51.131
"I still see sugarplums."
She'll know what it means.

17:51.637 --> 17:54.606
Does it mean that you want her
to make you one of her holiday cakes?

17:56.175 --> 17:58.666
- Yeah, that's what it means.
- Yeah.

17:59.445 --> 18:01.538
So, where are your friends?

18:01.580 --> 18:03.411
They never showed up.

18:04.016 --> 18:06.450
Man, if one of them needed me,
I'd be there.

18:06.485 --> 18:08.646
Okay, like, when Trang asked me
to help him move,

18:08.687 --> 18:10.882
I said no because I didn't want
to slow everyone down

18:10.923 --> 18:12.914
with my hilarious jokes.

18:13.425 --> 18:16.053
- Are you scared about this?
- No.

18:16.662 --> 18:17.822
Okay.

18:22.668 --> 18:24.966
Look, I'm totally freaked out.

18:25.337 --> 18:28.568
And I pushed away the one person
who was here for me.

18:28.607 --> 18:32.134
Old man, here's your stinking forms.
Enjoy driving again.

18:32.177 --> 18:33.940
Try not to kill anybody.

18:34.480 --> 18:36.038
What was that?

18:36.348 --> 18:39.977
He just did me a big favor,

18:40.018 --> 18:42.179
even though
I was a real douche to him.

18:43.322 --> 18:46.917
And I was just scared

18:46.959 --> 18:51.157
about getting old
and losing my independence.

18:51.196 --> 18:52.595
It sucks.

18:53.398 --> 18:56.458
Man, I don't want people
to know when I'm scared.

18:56.502 --> 18:59.335
- It's weak.
- Yeah, I used to be like you.

18:59.371 --> 19:01.862
You know, putting up a front,
shutting people out,

19:01.907 --> 19:04.705
acting like
you don't need anybody. Yeah.

19:04.743 --> 19:06.643
Fortunately, though, I got past all that.

19:06.678 --> 19:11.138
Because, you see, the best thing
about letting people know

19:11.183 --> 19:14.277
how you really feel about them is then,

19:14.319 --> 19:17.584
no matter how big a jackass
you've been,

19:17.623 --> 19:20.148
they'll still show up for you
when times are bad.

19:23.095 --> 19:24.858
Hey, I got your message.

19:24.897 --> 19:27.331
- Did you listen to the whole thing?
- Yeah.

19:27.399 --> 19:29.162
Then why are you wearing a bra?

19:30.002 --> 19:31.094
I'm not.

19:33.038 --> 19:35.063
Thanks for coming.

19:35.641 --> 19:37.541
I was a jerk and you didn't deserve it.

19:37.609 --> 19:39.577
I know you were scared.

19:40.045 --> 19:42.639
I'll be here when you get out, okay?

19:44.950 --> 19:47.646
Sometimes ego gets in the way
of what's best for you.

19:47.719 --> 19:49.380
Whether it's combining forces...

19:49.421 --> 19:52.879
Now, this guy's never prepared
for class a day in his life.

19:52.925 --> 19:54.324
Let's say we start with him?

19:54.359 --> 19:57.089
The weird shoes,
the skinny chicken legs...

19:57.129 --> 19:58.824
- What are you guys doing?
- You were right about us.

19:58.864 --> 20:00.354
We are so alike.

20:00.399 --> 20:03.425
So, we decided to team up
and make life hell for the med students.

20:03.468 --> 20:04.526
What have I done?

20:04.570 --> 20:06.834
...the opportunity to thank a friend...

20:06.872 --> 20:11.070
That's the good stuff. I swiped it
from the bar at the country club.

20:11.577 --> 20:13.044
You're welcome, Bob.

20:13.078 --> 20:15.069
...or the chance to do something nice

20:15.113 --> 20:18.014
for the people in your life
because you actually do care.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.211
Hey, I know
we're gonna be studying late,

20:20.285 --> 20:22.378
so I bought you nerds dinner.

20:22.421 --> 20:24.548
Did you rub, graze, touch, dip,

20:24.590 --> 20:26.922
drag or spread your stuff
on any part of this?

20:26.959 --> 20:29.860
Wanted to, decided not to.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.055
Cole?

20:32.431 --> 20:35.594
I just wanted to do something nice
for you guys.

20:35.734 --> 20:37.861
Hey, Dr. Kelso's driving again.

20:44.610 --> 20:47.010
Yeah, that's about right.

20:50.515 --> 20:53.541
Hey, I wanted to talk to you
about skin cancer.

20:53.585 --> 20:56.418
It's very serious but easily preventable.

20:56.488 --> 20:59.980
Always wear sunscreen,
get a full body check-up annually

21:00.025 --> 21:03.756
and when you go to the beach,
stay covered up, unless you're a hottie,

21:03.795 --> 21:06.559
in which case,
you should take it all off and get weird.

21:06.598 --> 21:08.862
We're trying to make a video
about cancer awareness.

21:08.900 --> 21:10.367
Okay, what about hottie awareness?

21:10.402 --> 21:12.233
Have you been to the beach lately?

21:12.271 --> 21:15.331
It's all families eating hard-boiled eggs.
Okay, that ain't right.

21:15.374 --> 21:16.636
You know what, just go... Hey, go, go.

21:16.675 --> 21:19.576
Press record. I got this. I'll figure it out.

21:19.611 --> 21:21.909
Hotties, remember this,

21:21.947 --> 21:24.814
you cannot get skin cancer
on your taters.

21:25.305 --> 21:31.588
