00:59.793 --> 01:01.229
- I DON'T GIVE A SHIT.

01:01.262 --> 01:04.232
I NEED TO TALK TO HIM NOW.

01:09.737 --> 01:12.373
STUART, I CAN'T DO THIS.
I-I WON'T DO THIS.

01:12.406 --> 01:13.741
I'LL GIVE
THE GODDAMN MONEY--

01:13.774 --> 01:15.476
- I DON'T KNOW,
I'VE GOT A CELL PHONE,

01:15.509 --> 01:17.845
A BEEPER, AND HE STILL SAID
HE CAN'T REACH HIM.

01:17.878 --> 01:19.447
- ALL RIGHT, OKAY,
I'LL LISTEN.

01:19.480 --> 01:22.116
GO ON.

01:22.150 --> 01:23.651
I KNOW THAT.

01:23.684 --> 01:26.487
I KNOW THAT.
YEAH.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.456
- WHAT THE FUCK
IS GOING ON HERE?

01:28.489 --> 01:30.658
- YOUR SUBJECT'S
BEING MOST UNCOOPERATIVE.

01:30.691 --> 01:33.361
- HE SAID HE MADE A BIG MISTAKE.
HE'S TALKING TO HIS AGENT.

01:33.394 --> 01:35.763
- WELL, DID YOU REMIND HIM
THAT HE HAS A CONTRACT?

01:35.796 --> 01:38.599
- YEAH, I THOUGHT WE'D LEAVE
THAT LITTLE TIDBIT TO YOU.

01:38.632 --> 01:40.134
- LOOK, NOW IT'S MY TURN,

01:40.168 --> 01:41.602
AND YOU'RE GOING
TO FUCKING LISTEN TO ME.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.204
I'M GOING TO LEAVE HERE
RIGHT NOW.

01:43.237 --> 01:44.872
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

01:44.905 --> 01:46.674
NO, I'M NOT GOING
TO "GRIN AND BEAR IT."

01:46.707 --> 01:48.909
YOU GOTTA GET ME
OUT OF THIS.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.778
- ANYTHING I CAN DO TO HELP?
- YEAH.

01:50.811 --> 01:53.247
YOU CAN GET ME MY PANTS.
- OH.

01:53.281 --> 01:55.483
BEFORE I DO THAT, WHY DON'T
WE DISCUSS YOUR CONCERNS?

01:55.516 --> 01:57.485
- THERE'S NOTHING TO DISCUSS.
I'M NOT DOING IT.

01:57.518 --> 01:59.420
- [chuckles]

01:59.453 --> 02:03.491
UH, IT'S A LITTLE BIT LATE
FOR THAT, ISN'T IT?

02:03.524 --> 02:06.227
- I'M DREW BOYD.
I CALL THE SHOTS.

02:06.260 --> 02:09.297
- EXCEPT WHEN I HAVE THE BALL.

02:11.532 --> 02:13.301
- I'M FEELING KIND OF EXPOSED,
YOU KNOW?

02:13.334 --> 02:15.269
I'M NOT USED TO STANDING AROUND
IN MY SHORTS.

02:15.303 --> 02:16.504
- WHAT ABOUT
IN THE LOCKER ROOM?

02:16.537 --> 02:18.239
YOU STAND AROUND
IN A LOT LESS.

02:18.272 --> 02:21.709
- IN THE LOCKER ROOM,
EVERYONE IS SHOWING THEIR ASS.

02:23.877 --> 02:25.779
- [chuckles]
COME.

02:29.817 --> 02:32.720
- NICE, DREW.
GOOD.

02:32.753 --> 02:34.455
A LITTLE SMILE.

02:34.488 --> 02:38.292
GOOD, NICE.

02:38.326 --> 02:39.960
THAT'S IT, DREW.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.829
OKAY, PUT THE BALL UP.

02:41.862 --> 02:43.464
HIGH UP.
YOU WON THE GAME.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.199
- CHRIST, HE'S HOT.

02:45.233 --> 02:46.934
- LOOK OVER THERE.
- WHAT A PITY HE'S STRAIGHT.

02:46.967 --> 02:48.836
- WELL, EVEN IF HE WEREN'T,
YOU THINK HE'D FUCK YOU

02:48.869 --> 02:50.471
WEARING THOSE?

02:50.504 --> 02:52.273
- OKAY, TONE IT DOWN A BIT.

02:52.306 --> 02:54.275
- WASN'T EXPECTING TO BE
STANDING AROUND IN MY SHORTS.

02:54.308 --> 02:55.543
- NOW GO UP FOR A LONG PASS.

02:55.576 --> 02:58.812
THAT'S GOOD. I LIKE IT.
BEAUTIFUL.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.648
- I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S
GOING TO SELL ANY UNDERWEAR,

03:00.681 --> 03:02.816
BUT HE SURE AS HELL IS GOING
TO SELL A LOT OF KLEENEX.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.685
- OH, YES.
THAT'S NICE, DREW.

03:04.718 --> 03:05.953
- OH, YEAH.
- BEAUTIFUL.

03:05.986 --> 03:08.689
LET'S GET SERIOUS NOW.
YEAH.

- * MAMA SAYS
DON'T PLAY WITH MATCHES *

03:11.592 --> 03:16.330
* BUT IT'S A LESSON
THAT I NEVER LEARNED *

03:16.364 --> 03:17.698
* LORD KNOWS THAT
I'VE BEEN DRAWN TO STRANGERS *

03:17.731 --> 03:20.568
- YOU KNOW,
ONCE I GOT USED TO EVERYBODY

03:20.601 --> 03:22.303
STARING AT ME IN MY SHORTS,

03:22.336 --> 03:23.971
IT GOT TO BE A REAL TURN-ON.

03:24.004 --> 03:26.840
- BUT ONLY I KNOW
WHAT'S UNDER THEM.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.876
[chuckles]

03:30.611 --> 03:31.712
GUESS WE'D BETTER GET UP.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.447
- WHAT'S YOUR HURRY?

03:33.481 --> 03:34.715
- WELL, AS SOON
AS WE'RE THROUGH,

03:34.748 --> 03:36.317
YOU ALWAYS BOUND OUT OF BED

03:36.350 --> 03:39.353
AND RACE TO THE SHOWER,
SO I JUST ASSUMED...

03:39.387 --> 03:42.456
- WHY DON'T WE JUST LIE HERE?

03:42.490 --> 03:43.857
- YOU SURE?

03:43.891 --> 03:46.327
- YOU SEE ME MOVING?

03:46.360 --> 03:48.462
- [chuckles]

03:48.496 --> 03:51.332
WOW!
WHAT'S THE WORLD COMING TO?

03:51.365 --> 03:54.468
FIRST A KISS,
THEN STICKING AROUND.

03:54.502 --> 03:57.338
NEXT THING YOU KNOW, YOU'LL
BE ASKING ME TO THE BIG GAME.

03:57.371 --> 03:58.606
[chuckles]

03:58.639 --> 04:01.742
YEAH, I SAID TOO MUCH,
DIDN'T I?

04:01.775 --> 04:04.878
- [sighs]
YOU KNOW THE RULES.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.814
- I KNOW.

04:06.847 --> 04:09.016
WHAT GOES ON IN THIS ROOM
IS BETWEEN YOU, ME,

04:09.049 --> 04:11.385
AND THE FOUR WALLS
AND MUST NEVER LEAVE HERE

04:11.419 --> 04:12.820
ON PENALTY OF DEATH.

04:12.853 --> 04:15.389
- YOU GOT IT, SPORT.
- HMM.

04:21.862 --> 04:23.931
[door closing]

04:25.065 --> 04:26.967
- HEY, LEAVE A MESSAGE.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.636
- [scoffs]
STRAIGHT TO VOICE MAIL.

04:28.669 --> 04:29.937
WHAT WAS THE POINT
OF GETTING HIM A CELL PHONE

04:29.970 --> 04:31.639
IF HE'S NOT
GOING TO PICK UP?

04:31.672 --> 04:33.040
[door opening]

[phone rings]

04:35.576 --> 04:37.311
THAT'S ME GOING OFF
IN YOUR POCKET.

04:37.345 --> 04:38.412
HOW ABOUT ANSWERING IT
FOR A CHANGE?

04:38.446 --> 04:39.913
- WHAT'S UP YOUR ASS?

04:39.947 --> 04:41.715
- IT'S PAST 11:00.

04:41.749 --> 04:43.584
- YOU MISSED CURFEW AGAIN.
WHERE YOU BEEN?

04:43.617 --> 04:45.653
- STUDYING WITH A FRIEND.

04:45.686 --> 04:46.920
- EVERY NIGHT THIS WEEK?

04:46.954 --> 04:48.389
- WE'RE WORKING ON A PROJECT.

04:48.422 --> 04:49.723
- WHO IS THIS FRIEND?

04:49.757 --> 04:51.325
- SOMEONE FROM SCHOOL.

04:51.359 --> 04:52.926
- AND THE PROJECT?
- IT'S FOR SCIENCE.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.395
- PENICILLIN'S
ALREADY BEEN DISCOVERED.

04:54.428 --> 04:55.796
WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND?

04:55.829 --> 04:57.064
- WHAT'S WITH
ALL THE FUCKING QUESTIONS?

04:57.097 --> 04:58.932
- WE WOULD LIKE
AN HONEST ANSWER.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.834
- I TOLD YOU THE TRUTH.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.870
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BELIEVE ME,
THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM.

05:02.903 --> 05:05.305
[door slams]

05:07.575 --> 05:08.876
- I HATE TO SAY IT.
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

05:08.909 --> 05:11.479
I ALREADY KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

05:11.512 --> 05:12.680
- IF HE'S OUT HUSTLING AGAIN,

05:12.713 --> 05:14.415
I WILL FUCKING
RIP HIS BALLS OFF,

05:14.448 --> 05:15.816
AS MY DEAR MOTHER
WOULD SAY.

05:15.849 --> 05:16.950
- LET'S HOPE WE'VE INSTILLED

05:16.984 --> 05:18.552
MORE SELF-RESPECT IN HIM
THAN THAT.

05:18.586 --> 05:20.087
- AFTER THE WAY
HE'S BEEN ACTING?

05:20.120 --> 05:24.425
- WHATEVER IT IS,
WE'LL FIND OUT EVENTUALLY.

05:24.458 --> 05:25.826
- THEN WHAT?

05:25.859 --> 05:29.530
- THEN WE'LL JUST HAVE
TO DEAL WITH IT.

05:34.935 --> 05:36.404
- [groans]

05:39.473 --> 05:41.909
- NEED SOME HELP?

05:41.942 --> 05:44.778
- UH, NO.
THANKS.

05:44.812 --> 05:45.846
I CAN DO IT.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.448
I DO IT EVERY MORNING.

05:47.481 --> 05:48.516
[keys clatter]
AH, SHIT!

05:48.549 --> 05:50.718
- [groans]

05:50.751 --> 05:51.785
MY BACK'S BEEN KILLING ME
EVER SINCE

05:51.819 --> 05:53.854
I DID THAT GODDAMN MURAL.

05:53.887 --> 05:58.125
I HOPE MICHELANGELO
HAD A GOOD CHIROPRACTOR.

05:58.158 --> 06:00.594
WHY HAVEN'T YOU
RETURNED MY CALLS?

06:00.628 --> 06:02.129
- I'VE BEEN BUSY.
- HMM.

06:02.162 --> 06:03.464
- THE SHOW'S
BEEN A HUGE SUCCESS.

06:03.497 --> 06:04.598
ISN'T THAT GREAT?

06:04.632 --> 06:06.867
ALMOST EVERYTHING'S SOLD.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.936
- ANOTHER MONTH
OF ALIMONY PAYMENTS.

06:08.969 --> 06:12.372
MY WIVES
WILL BE ETERNALLY GRATEFUL.

06:13.941 --> 06:16.410
I WANT TO SEE YOU.

06:18.446 --> 06:19.480
- I CAN'T.

06:19.513 --> 06:21.014
- WHY NOT?

06:21.048 --> 06:24.151
- "WHY NOT?"

06:24.184 --> 06:26.887
TRY "I'M MARRIED."
- [scoffs]

06:26.920 --> 06:29.022
- I HAVE A CHILD,
ANOTHER ONE ON THE WAY.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.491
OH, AND DID I
HAPPEN TO MENTION,

06:30.524 --> 06:32.159
LEST WE FORGET,
THAT I'M A LESBIAN?

06:32.192 --> 06:34.662
- AND DID I MENTION THAT
YOU SURE DON'T FUCK LIKE ONE?

06:34.695 --> 06:38.899
- OH, JESUS CHRIST, SAM.

06:38.932 --> 06:40.901
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE
SO CRUDE?

06:40.934 --> 06:42.670
- YOU DIDN'T MIND
THE OTHER NIGHT,

06:42.703 --> 06:44.037
ROLLING AROUND ON THE FLOOR,
RUTTING LIKE A COUPLE OF--

06:44.071 --> 06:48.909
- WHAT HAPPENED THE OTHER NIGHT
WAS A MISTAKE.

06:48.942 --> 06:52.813
A HUGE MISTAKE.

06:52.846 --> 06:56.550
- WAS IT?

06:56.584 --> 06:58.519
- [sighs]

06:58.552 --> 07:00.988
YES, IT WAS.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.056
LOOK, SAM,

07:03.090 --> 07:05.559
YOU INSPIRE ME.

07:05.593 --> 07:07.194
YOU CHALLENGE ME.

07:07.227 --> 07:09.563
YOU MAKE ME LAUGH.

07:09.597 --> 07:13.100
I ADMIRE YOU SO MUCH.

07:13.133 --> 07:15.669
I...

07:15.703 --> 07:18.672
GUESS I GOT CONFUSED.

07:18.706 --> 07:20.674
YOU KNOW?

07:20.708 --> 07:24.978
AND CROSSED A LINE
I SHOULDN'T HAVE.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.949
- WHEN I WAS A KID...

07:28.982 --> 07:31.852
I DIDN'T RESPECT THE LINES.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.120
IN MY COLORING BOOKS,

07:33.153 --> 07:34.822
I ALWAYS CROSSED THE LINES,

07:34.855 --> 07:37.558
DIDN'T OBEY THE RULES AT ALL.

07:37.591 --> 07:40.694
I DON'T THINK THAT'S ALWAYS
SUCH A BAD THING.

07:40.728 --> 07:44.031
- FOR AN ARTIST, NO.

07:46.266 --> 07:49.236
BUT FOR A PERSON...

07:49.269 --> 07:51.605
SOMETIMES IT MAKES SENSE
TO READ THE MANUAL

07:51.639 --> 07:54.041
AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS...

07:54.074 --> 07:57.511
DULL AS THAT MAY SOUND
TO YOU.

07:57.545 --> 07:58.846
- WHAT ABOUT
THE PART OF YOU

07:58.879 --> 08:02.149
THAT SECRETLY YEARNS
FOR SOMETHING ELSE?

08:02.182 --> 08:06.186
THE PART OF YOU THAT BOTH OF US
KNOW IS THERE.

08:09.757 --> 08:12.526
- MY HOUSE HAS MANY ROOMS.

08:12.560 --> 08:15.128
I OCCUPY BUT A FEW.

08:15.162 --> 08:18.498
THE REST GO UNVISITED.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.935
- WHO SAID THAT?

08:21.969 --> 08:25.238
- I DID.

08:27.174 --> 08:30.210
[keys jingle]

08:33.313 --> 08:35.783
[door opening]

08:44.124 --> 08:46.059
[door shuts]

08:49.062 --> 08:50.631
- NICE CHEST.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.165
- I'LL SAY.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.167
- I THINK HE'S TALKING
ABOUT THE FURNITURE.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.836
- THAT TOO.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.971
- UNCLE VIC LEFT IT
TO THE HOSPICE IN HIS WILL.

08:58.005 --> 09:02.910
- HE WAS ALWAYS A GOOD FRIEND
AND A GREAT SUPPORTER.

09:02.943 --> 09:06.780
OH, I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW MUCH WE APPRECIATE THIS.

09:06.814 --> 09:08.649
WE NEED ALL THE HELP
WE CAN GET.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.250
- HOPEFULLY, THIS NEW EVENT
COORDINATOR WILL COME THROUGH.

09:10.283 --> 09:11.919
- HE'D BETTER.

09:11.952 --> 09:13.654
- WELL, THEY SAY HE RAISED
OVER A MILLION DOLLARS

09:13.687 --> 09:15.122
FOR A HOSPICE
IN CINCINNATI, SO--

09:15.155 --> 09:16.657
- A MILLION?

09:16.690 --> 09:18.325
MY GOD,
IF WE RAISE HALF THAT,

09:18.358 --> 09:20.060
WE'LL BE IN HEAVEN.

09:20.093 --> 09:21.795
HERE.
LET ME TAKE THAT.

09:21.829 --> 09:23.096
THANKS.

09:23.130 --> 09:26.667
[indistinct chatter]

09:26.700 --> 09:28.135
- HEY, FREDDY,
HOW ABOUT THOSE IRONMEN?

09:28.168 --> 09:29.803
AIN'T THEY SOMETHING ELSE?

09:29.837 --> 09:31.238
- [hoarse]
YEAH, SOMETHING ELSE, ALL RIGHT.

09:31.271 --> 09:34.742
- HONEY, YOU OUGHT
TO TAKE SOMETHING FOR THAT COLD.

09:34.775 --> 09:36.343
EMMETT!

09:36.376 --> 09:38.245
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
READING THE SPORTS PAGE?

09:38.278 --> 09:40.213
LET ME GET YOU
THE STYLE SECTION, SWEETHEART.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.215
- NO, NO, DEB.
THESE DAYS, THE SPORTS PAGE

09:42.249 --> 09:45.018
WILL DO ME JUST FINE.

09:45.052 --> 09:46.954
- HEY, DEB.
- HEY, BOB.

09:46.987 --> 09:49.757
HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN AN AGE.
WHERE YOU BEEN?

09:49.790 --> 09:51.959
- WELL, I WAS, UH, I WAS LAID UP
WITH SOME BACK TROUBLE,

09:51.992 --> 09:53.627
BUT I'M ON MY FEET AGAIN.

09:53.661 --> 09:54.962
- YEAH?
- HOW YOU BEEN?

09:54.995 --> 09:58.098
- LIFE TOOK A COUPLE
OF POTSHOTS, BUT...

09:58.131 --> 10:00.233
I DUCKED.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.836
- SO YOU SEEN CARL?

10:02.870 --> 10:04.237
- NO, NOT LATELY.

10:04.271 --> 10:05.639
- I FIGURED
HE'D BE TAKING YOU TONIGHT.

10:05.673 --> 10:07.240
- TAKING ME WHERE?

10:07.274 --> 10:08.709
- THE POLICEMAN'S BALL.

10:08.742 --> 10:11.244
HE TOOK YOU LAST YEAR,
DIDN'T HE?

10:11.278 --> 10:14.047
- YEAH, HE TOOK ME.

10:14.081 --> 10:17.017
- I REMEMBER, 'CAUSE, UH,
YOU LOOKED REAL NICE.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.853
- THANKS.

10:19.887 --> 10:21.755
I GUESS, UH, THIS YEAR,

10:21.789 --> 10:24.124
HE MUST BE TAKING
SOMEONE ELSE.

10:24.157 --> 10:25.726
- EXCUSE ME, OFFICER,

10:25.759 --> 10:27.728
BUT ANYONE CAN GO
TO THE POLICEMAN'S BALL.

10:27.761 --> 10:28.862
AM I CORRECT?

10:28.896 --> 10:30.864
- ANYONE WHO BUYS A TICKET.

10:30.898 --> 10:34.134
UH, I'LL TAKE
THE PINK PLATE SPECIAL,

10:34.167 --> 10:35.302
BUT MAKE MINE BLUE.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.805
- YOU GOT IT.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.041
DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE THINKING OF GOING.

10:41.074 --> 10:42.876
- IF I CAN FIND A DATE.

10:42.910 --> 10:45.212
- YEAH, GOOD LUCK.
- HEY.

10:45.245 --> 10:46.747
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

10:46.780 --> 10:48.081
- ME?

10:48.115 --> 10:50.017
WHAT, ARE YOU
OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND?

10:50.050 --> 10:51.785
- WHY NOT?
- WELL, YOU JUST HEARD.

10:51.819 --> 10:54.788
CARL'S GOING TO BE THERE,
PROBABLY WITH THAT...

10:54.822 --> 10:56.323
LADY HE'S BEEN SEEING.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.158
- SO?
THAT'S NO REASON NOT TO GO.

10:58.191 --> 11:00.728
IN FACT, ALL THE MORE REASON
TO BE THERE.

11:00.761 --> 11:01.829
SHOW HIM WHAT HE'S MISSING.

11:01.862 --> 11:03.430
- [scoffs]
NOT MUCH.

11:03.463 --> 11:04.464
- NOW, NOW.

11:04.497 --> 11:05.799
LET'S KEEP OUR SELF-ESTEEM,

11:05.833 --> 11:07.768
AND OUR TITS, UP.

11:07.801 --> 11:10.771
- EVEN IF I WANTED TO GO,
WITH MY TITS UP,

11:10.804 --> 11:12.439
I GOT NOTHING
TO DRAPE 'EM IN.

11:12.472 --> 11:14.808
- JUST LEAVE THAT
TO YOUR FAIRY GOD--

11:14.842 --> 11:16.043
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO SAY IT.

11:16.076 --> 11:17.177
TOO TRITE.

11:17.210 --> 11:20.047
HOWEVER,
YOU WILL LOOK FABULOUS.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.816
I GUARANTEE.

11:25.418 --> 11:30.057
- WHAT HAVE I DONE?

11:30.090 --> 11:32.793
NOW HE WANTS TO SEE ME AGAIN,
AND OF COURSE, I TOLD HIM NO.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.194
IT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION.

11:34.227 --> 11:39.132
WE CAN NEVER,
NEVER DO THAT AGAIN.

11:39.166 --> 11:40.467
- IS HE HUNG?

11:40.500 --> 11:43.837
- OH, BRIAN!
- I'M JUST CURIOUS.

11:43.871 --> 11:45.238
[chuckles]

11:45.272 --> 11:46.506
YOU'RE THE LAST PERSON
I THOUGHT

11:46.539 --> 11:48.075
I'D EVER DISCUSS DICK WITH.

11:48.108 --> 11:50.477
- THIS ISN'T ABOUT DICK.
- SINCE WHEN?

11:50.510 --> 11:52.813
- I LOVE MELANIE.

11:52.846 --> 11:54.347
- [pats shoulder]
SURE, YOU DO.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.416
- THEN HOW COULD I HAVE--

11:56.449 --> 11:59.086
- FUCKED A GUY?
- IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.954
- ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE.

12:00.988 --> 12:02.890
IT'S EXPLAINING IT
THAT'S THE TRICKY PART.

12:02.923 --> 12:05.993
- BUT I'VE ALWAYS BEEN,
YOU KNOW--

12:06.026 --> 12:07.294
- A CARPET MUNCHER.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.096
- MMM.

12:09.129 --> 12:11.965
EXCEPT FOR THAT ONE TIME
IN COLLEGE WHEN...

12:11.999 --> 12:14.868
YOU AND I...
BUT THAT WAS JUST--

12:14.902 --> 12:19.106
- MIDSUMMER MADNESS.
- [laughs]

12:19.139 --> 12:21.775
- STILL, THERE IS
A PART OF YOU THAT,

12:21.809 --> 12:23.844
ONCE EVERY DECADE OR SO,

12:23.877 --> 12:26.413
DOESN'T OBJECT
TO A STIFF PRICK.

12:26.446 --> 12:29.850
BELIEVE ME, I UNDERSTAND.

12:29.883 --> 12:32.552
- I'M NOT SO SURE
MELANIE WOULD.

12:32.585 --> 12:33.987
- THEN DON'T TELL HER.

12:34.021 --> 12:36.523
- [sighs]
YOU'RE A BIG HELP.

12:36.556 --> 12:38.391
- HEY.

12:38.425 --> 12:42.562
IT'S OKAY TO LIKE COCK.

12:42.595 --> 12:45.265
AND IT'S OKAY TO LIKE PUSSY,
JUST NOT AT THE SAME TIME.

12:45.298 --> 12:48.201
SO...

12:49.903 --> 12:52.806
WHICH ONE DO YOU LIKE?

12:54.041 --> 12:56.209
[bells jingle]

12:56.243 --> 12:58.011
- WELL, LOOK WHO IT IS.

12:58.045 --> 13:01.014
COME TO SHOOT THE BREEZE?
HAVE A HEART-TO-HEART?

13:01.048 --> 13:03.817
SPEND A LITTLE QUALITY TIME
WITH YOUR DASHING YOUNG DAD?

13:03.851 --> 13:06.286
- I NEED 20 BUCKS.
- I KNEW IT.

13:06.319 --> 13:07.420
WHAT DO YOU WANT IT FOR?

13:07.454 --> 13:09.489
- MY UPWARDLY MOBILE
LIFESTYLE.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.424
BEING A TEENAGER'S EXPENSIVE.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.894
- YOU SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT
OF THAT BEFORE YOU BECAME ONE.

13:13.927 --> 13:16.897
- HMM.
SO CAN I HAVE IT?

13:16.930 --> 13:19.066
- WHY SHOULD I REWARD YOU
FOR MISSING YOUR CURFEW

13:19.099 --> 13:21.601
AND BEING DISRESPECTFUL
TO US?

13:21.634 --> 13:23.503
- HOW THE FUCK
AM I BEING DISRESPECTFUL?

13:23.536 --> 13:25.172
- BY NOT TELLING US THE TRUTH.

13:25.205 --> 13:28.208
- I TOLD YOU.

13:28.241 --> 13:33.046
- LOOK, I'M NOT ABOVE PAYING
FOR INFORMATION,

13:33.080 --> 13:34.581
BUT FIRST,
YOU'VE GOT TO COME CLEAN.

13:34.614 --> 13:36.049
- I TOOK A SHOWER
THIS MORNING.

13:36.083 --> 13:38.185
- ARE YOU HUSTLING AGAIN?

13:38.218 --> 13:39.452
- IF I WAS HUSTLING,

13:39.486 --> 13:42.589
WOULD I BE ASKING YOU
FOR 20 BUCKS?

13:42.622 --> 13:44.057
- GOOD POINT.

13:44.091 --> 13:45.225
BUT THEN AGAIN,
MAYBE YOU'RE JUST TRYING

13:45.258 --> 13:46.459
TO THROW ME OFF THE TRACK.

13:46.493 --> 13:49.396
- FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

13:51.298 --> 13:54.501
I'M KIND OF DATING SOMEONE,
OKAY?

13:54.534 --> 13:56.236
- REALLY?
- YEAH, REALLY.

13:56.269 --> 13:57.470
IS THAT SO HARD TO IMAGINE?

13:57.504 --> 13:59.139
- NO, NO, NOT AT ALL.

13:59.172 --> 14:02.109
THAT'S--
IT'S GREAT, BUT I--

14:02.142 --> 14:04.211
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST SAY SO?

14:04.244 --> 14:06.246
- YOU KNOW HOW KIDS ARE
AT MY AGE.

14:06.279 --> 14:07.614
WE'RE TRYING TO DEVELOP
A SENSE OF SELF,

14:07.647 --> 14:09.616
WHICH OFTEN MANIFESTS ITSELF
IN A RELUCTANCE

14:09.649 --> 14:13.253
TO COMMUNICATE WITH PARENTS
AND OTHER AUTHORITY FIGURES.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.957
- HERE'S 30.
GO TO THE MOVIES.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.858
- SWEET.

14:21.294 --> 14:22.395
[bells jingle]

14:22.429 --> 14:27.134
[phone dialing]

14:27.167 --> 14:28.969
- BEN?

14:29.002 --> 14:31.571
I HOPE YOU'RE SITTING DOWN.

14:31.604 --> 14:33.540
GUESS WHAT.

14:33.573 --> 14:37.077
OUR BOY HAS A BOYFRIEND.

14:38.678 --> 14:40.313
- YOU SURE I DON'T LOOK
LIKE A FIRE HYDRANT?

14:40.347 --> 14:42.649
I WOULDN'T WANT ANY DOGS
MAKING A MISTAKE.

14:42.682 --> 14:44.251
- YOU DO NOT LOOK
LIKE A FIRE HYDRANT.

14:44.284 --> 14:46.119
- YOU'RE POSITIVELY GLOWING.

14:46.153 --> 14:48.521
- I DON'T MIND GLOWING,
AS LONG AS I'M NOT RADIOACTIVE.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.123
OH, SHIT, THERE'S CARL.

14:50.157 --> 14:51.258
- OH.
- YES, DEAR?

14:51.291 --> 14:52.559
- I SHOULD SAY...
- WHAT DO I DO?

14:52.592 --> 14:53.560
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WHAT DO YOU DO?

14:53.593 --> 14:55.028
YOU STAND THERE AND GLOW.

14:55.062 --> 14:57.998
[both forcing laughter]

14:58.031 --> 15:00.167
AH.
- OH, HI, CARL.

15:00.200 --> 15:03.036
- DEBBIE. EMMETT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

15:03.070 --> 15:06.406
- WELL, IT'S A BALL TO RAISE
MONEY FOR THE COPS, ISN'T IT?

15:06.439 --> 15:09.009
AND I'VE ALWAYS HAD A SOFT SPOT
FOR MEN IN UNIFORM.

15:09.042 --> 15:12.012
- AND I'VE ALWAYS
HAD A HARD SPOT.

15:12.045 --> 15:13.546
- DEBBIE, EMMETT,
THIS IS KATHERINE,

15:13.580 --> 15:16.149
THE PERSON I TOLD YOU ABOUT.

15:16.183 --> 15:18.151

15:18.185 --> 15:19.719
YOU'RE CERTAINLY JUST AS...

15:19.752 --> 15:22.555
COLORFUL AS CARL

15:22.589 --> 15:24.424

15:24.457 --> 15:27.027
- WILL YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR A MOMENT, CARL?

15:27.060 --> 15:30.330
I'M JUST GOING
TO THE POWDER ROOM.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.434
- WOULD ANYONE LIKE A DRINK?

15:34.467 --> 15:37.370
- OH, GOD, YES.
- GOD, YES.

15:40.207 --> 15:42.575
- I, UH--

15:42.609 --> 15:45.178
I WASN'T EXPECTING
TO SEE YOU.

15:45.212 --> 15:47.247
- I HOPE IT DOESN'T MAKE YOU
UNCOMFORTABLE.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.082
- NO, NO. I LIKE--

15:49.116 --> 15:52.652
I MEAN, I-IT'S NICE--

15:52.685 --> 15:56.389
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
I'M TRYING TO SAY.

15:56.423 --> 15:58.091
- YOU LOOK VERY HANDSOME.

15:58.125 --> 16:02.062
- A-AND YOU LOOK VERY...

16:02.095 --> 16:04.497
- RED?

16:04.531 --> 16:09.102
[both laughing]

16:09.136 --> 16:11.738
- I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU'RE
GETTING OUT, ENJOYING YOURSELF.

16:11.771 --> 16:14.007

YOU KNOW?

16:14.041 --> 16:17.977

EVERY YEAR.

16:31.424 --> 16:33.560
THEY OUGHT TO GET

16:33.593 --> 16:37.364

16:37.397 --> 16:40.300

16:41.801 --> 16:43.303

WHEN THE DRINKS FLOW FREELY,

20:10.910 --> 20:13.480
SO DO THE DONATIONS.

20:13.513 --> 20:15.582
- THIS GUY BOTHERING YOU,
JEFFREY?

20:15.615 --> 20:17.317
- NO, NOT AT ALL.

20:17.350 --> 20:21.788
JUST REVEALING SOME OF MY
UNDERHANDED BUSINESS PRACTICES.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.990
WELL, I BETTER
GO WORK THE ROOM.

20:24.023 --> 20:26.759
HOPE WE CAN COUNT
ON YOUR PLEDGE, BRIAN.

20:30.029 --> 20:31.731
- WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

20:31.764 --> 20:34.901
- YOU KNOW ME, MEL,
ALWAYS STIRRING UP THE SHIT.

20:38.838 --> 20:44.777
[moaning]

20:54.787 --> 20:55.922
- DO YOU WANT ME TO SUCK YOU?

20:55.955 --> 20:58.691
- UH...

20:58.725 --> 21:00.693
NO, NO, THAT'S OKAY.

21:00.727 --> 21:02.895
- HAS ANYBODY
EVER SUCKED YOU BEFORE?

21:02.929 --> 21:05.532
- YEAH.
- OH.

21:05.565 --> 21:09.769
- A LOT OF GIRLS?
- NO.

21:09.802 --> 21:11.638
- I'VE ONLY DONE IT TWICE.

21:11.671 --> 21:15.074
ONCE AT SUMMER CAMP
AND ONCE WITH MY LAST BOYFRIEND.

21:15.107 --> 21:18.044
YOU DON'T THINK
THAT MAKES ME A SLUT, DO YOU?

21:18.077 --> 21:20.046
- HARDLY.

21:20.079 --> 21:23.316
- BESIDES, IT'S NOT REAL SEX.

21:23.350 --> 21:25.585
I HAVEN'T HAD REAL SEX YET.

21:25.618 --> 21:26.953
HAVE YOU?

21:26.986 --> 21:29.989
- N-N-NOT REALLY.

21:30.022 --> 21:32.091
BUT I THINK ABOUT IT.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.060
- ME TOO.

21:34.093 --> 21:35.862
BUT I PROMISED TO DISCUSS IT

21:35.895 --> 21:38.965
WITH MY PARENTS FIRST
BEFORE I DO.

21:38.998 --> 21:42.535
WE'RE LIKE BEST FRIENDS.

21:42.569 --> 21:44.671
HOW ABOUT YOURS?

21:44.704 --> 21:46.439
- I DON'T THINK
I'LL TELL THEM.

21:46.473 --> 21:47.840
- HOW COME?

21:47.874 --> 21:50.076
- THEY'RE NOT LIKE YOUR FOLKS.

21:50.109 --> 21:52.412
- IN WHAT WAY?

21:52.445 --> 21:55.982
- THEY'RE...TWO GUYS.

21:57.850 --> 22:00.753
- YOU MEAN THEY'RE GAY?

22:00.787 --> 22:03.089
THAT'S SO COOL.

22:03.122 --> 22:04.724
- I DON'T KNOW
HOW COOL THEY'D BE

22:04.757 --> 22:07.427
IF I TOLD THEM
ABOUT YOU AND ME.

22:07.460 --> 22:12.031
- WELL, THEY DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO BE GAY JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE.

22:14.401 --> 22:16.703
- I DON'T KNOW.

22:16.736 --> 22:18.838
- WELL...

22:18.871 --> 22:21.641
I'LL BE GLAD TO TELL THEM
YOU'RE STRAIGHT,

22:21.674 --> 22:24.611
IF IT EVER COMES UP.

22:50.803 --> 22:55.174
[footsteps approaching]

22:55.207 --> 22:57.009
- HEY.

22:57.043 --> 22:58.911
- HOW'D IT GO?
- OH, GREAT!

22:58.945 --> 23:00.813
THIS GUY PENDERGRASS
IS GOING TO HELP US

23:00.847 --> 23:02.749
RAISE A SHITLOAD OF MONEY.

23:02.782 --> 23:04.183
- OH, THAT'S GOOD.
- YEAH.

23:04.216 --> 23:06.753
- I'M SORRY YOU WEREN'T THERE.
- ME TOO.

23:06.786 --> 23:08.187
I GOT THIS DAMN HEADACHE.

23:08.220 --> 23:11.190
- MMM. ANY BETTER?
- A LITTLE.

23:11.223 --> 23:14.427
- OH, I BLAME SAM FOR IT.

23:14.461 --> 23:15.795
- WHAT?

23:15.828 --> 23:18.631
- THE STRESS
OF DOING THE SHOW...

23:18.665 --> 23:21.934
LIVING UP TO HIS EXPECTATIONS
AS WELL AS YOURS.

23:21.968 --> 23:24.937
BUT YOU DID IT.

23:24.971 --> 23:27.640
- MM, THAT FEELS NICE.

23:27.674 --> 23:29.642
- MMM.

23:29.676 --> 23:31.611
- [gasps]

23:34.981 --> 23:38.585
MEL.
- MMM.

23:38.618 --> 23:42.188
- MEL?

23:42.221 --> 23:44.223
MIND IF WE...

23:44.256 --> 23:46.125
DO IT LATER?

23:46.158 --> 23:47.860
- SORRY.

23:47.894 --> 23:51.197
I'M JUST A HORNY PREGNANT LADY.

23:51.230 --> 23:53.132
I'LL LOOK IN ON GUS.

23:53.165 --> 23:55.668
YOU WANT ME TO GET YOU
SOME MORE HOT TEA?

23:55.702 --> 23:58.638
IT LOOKS COLD.

24:10.717 --> 24:13.085
- I KEPT MY TITS UP,
JUST LIKE YOU SAID.

24:13.119 --> 24:14.887
I PRACTICALLY THREW 'EM
AT HIM.

24:14.921 --> 24:16.088
DIDN'T DO MUCH GOOD.

24:16.122 --> 24:17.824
- DON'T DESPAIR.

24:17.857 --> 24:19.125
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO...
THINK OF ANOTHER WAY

24:19.158 --> 24:20.593
TO GET HIS ATTENTION,
THAT'S ALL.

24:20.627 --> 24:22.128
- WELL,
THEN WE BETTER THINK FAST

24:22.161 --> 24:25.097
BECAUSE THAT WOMAN'S
GOT MARRIAGE IN HER EYES.

24:25.131 --> 24:26.566
- I'VE GOT AN EXTRA TICKET

24:26.599 --> 24:28.635
FOR THE IRONMEN'S GAME
ON SUNDAY.

24:28.668 --> 24:31.638
WHO WANTS TO GO?

24:33.305 --> 24:35.708
I'VE GOT AN EXTRA TICKET
FOR 42ND STREET.

24:35.742 --> 24:36.709
WHO WANTS TO GO?

24:36.743 --> 24:38.511
[overlapping exclamations]

24:38.545 --> 24:40.913
I'M JUST--
I'M JUST TESTING.

24:40.947 --> 24:44.116
HOW ABOUT YOU, EM?
THEY'RE IN THE SKYBOX.

24:44.150 --> 24:46.185
A THANK-YOU GIFT FROM
THE STAR QUARTERBACK HIMSELF.

24:46.218 --> 24:48.120
- I DON'T THINK SO.
- COME ON.

24:48.154 --> 24:50.122
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO TURNED ME ON
TO HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE.

24:50.156 --> 24:52.592
YOU EVER SEEN HIM PLAY?
- NOT ON THE FIELD.

24:52.625 --> 24:55.862
- THEY SAY HE'S INCREDIBLY FAST
AND STRONG.

24:55.895 --> 24:58.598
- AS MUCH AS I'D LOVE TO GO,
I-I PROMISED I WOULDN'T.

24:58.631 --> 25:00.600
- PROMISED WHO?

25:00.633 --> 25:03.870
- THEN AGAIN, HOW MANY SEATS
DOES THAT STADIUM HOLD?

25:03.903 --> 25:05.271
- I DON'T KNOW.
80,000?

25:05.304 --> 25:07.139
- 80,000?
- MM-HMM.

25:07.173 --> 25:09.141
- WELL, YOU COULD HARDLY
PICK OUT A FACE IN THAT CROWD.

25:09.175 --> 25:10.677
RIGHT?
- YEAH.

25:10.710 --> 25:13.279
- SAY, UM, TEDDY,
I WAS JUST WONDERING,

25:13.312 --> 25:14.681
DO YOU THINK
MAYBE YOU COULD SCORE

25:14.714 --> 25:15.882
AN EXTRA PAIR
OF THOSE TICKETS FOR ME?

25:15.915 --> 25:18.284
- WELL, I COULD TRY.

25:18.317 --> 25:21.788
I HAVE A FRIEND
WHO MIGHT LIKE TO GO.

25:28.661 --> 25:30.162
[phone beeps]

25:30.196 --> 25:31.764
- WHAT?

25:31.798 --> 25:33.900
- THERE'S A JEFFREY PENDERGRASS
TO SEE YOU.

25:33.933 --> 25:36.903
HE SAYS HE DOESN'T
HAVE AN APPOINTMENT.

25:36.936 --> 25:39.972
- HE WANTS TO HIT ON ME.
- WHO DOESN'T?

25:40.006 --> 25:42.308
- EXCEPT HE WANTS MONEY.
SEND HIM IN.

25:42.341 --> 25:43.643
- OKAY.

25:43.676 --> 25:46.078
GO ON IN.

25:49.215 --> 25:51.651
- THEY TELL ME YOU'RE THE GUY
TO GET IN BED WITH.

25:51.684 --> 25:54.120
- WELL, YOU'LL HAVE TO COME BACK
AFTER OFFICE HOURS FOR THAT.

25:54.153 --> 25:57.323
- I KNOW YOU'RE A BUSY MAN,
SO LET ME CUT TO THE CHASE.

25:57.356 --> 25:59.659
- CHRIST,
I HATE THAT EXPRESSION.

25:59.692 --> 26:02.194
- I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE ONE
OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL

26:02.228 --> 26:03.830
GAY BUSINESSMEN
IN PITTSBURGH.

26:03.863 --> 26:05.331
- WHOEVER TOLD YOU THAT
WAS DEAD WRONG.

26:05.364 --> 26:08.100
I'M T MOST SUCCESSFUL
GAY BUSINESSMAN.

26:08.134 --> 26:09.869
- ALL THE MORE REASON THEN.

26:09.902 --> 26:11.971
I'D LIKE YOUR CLIENTS
TO BE CORPORATE SPONSORS

26:12.004 --> 26:13.072
FOR THE LIBERTY RIDE.

26:13.105 --> 26:16.809
- I SEE.

26:16.843 --> 26:19.812
LET ME CUT TO THE CHASE.
WHAT'S IN IT FOR THEM?

26:19.846 --> 26:21.714
MORE IMPORTANT,
WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME?

26:21.748 --> 26:24.250
- TWO VERY GOOD QUESTIONS.

26:24.283 --> 26:25.852
FIRST,
YOUR CLIENTS' CONTRIBUTIONS

26:25.885 --> 26:27.353
WILL GENERATE PUBLICITY
AND GOODWILL

26:27.386 --> 26:29.255
THAT ADVERTISING CAN'T BUY.

26:29.288 --> 26:31.991
PLUS, THEY'LL BE CULTIVATING
PRODUCT LOYALTIES IN A MARKET

26:32.024 --> 26:34.393
THAT HAS HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS
IN DISPOSABLE INCOME.

26:34.426 --> 26:38.898
- WELL, I ALREADY KNOW THAT.

26:38.931 --> 26:41.400
MY SECOND QUESTION--

26:41.433 --> 26:43.736
WHAT'S IN THE CRACKER JACK BOX
FOR ME?

26:43.770 --> 26:45.404
- A VERY PERSONAL THANK-YOU
FROM ME,

26:45.437 --> 26:47.373
AND A WARM, GOOEY FEELING
INSIDE.

26:47.406 --> 26:49.742
- [laughs]
JEFFREY, YOU DISAPPOINT ME.

26:49.776 --> 26:50.777
I THOUGHT YOU'D COME UP
WITH SOMETHING

26:50.810 --> 26:54.246
MORE ORIGINAL THAN THAT.

26:54.280 --> 26:58.250
SO DO WE HAVE TIME
FOR ONE LAST QUESTION?

26:58.284 --> 26:59.786
WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU?

26:59.819 --> 27:02.188
- A LIVING.

27:02.221 --> 27:05.024
- FINALLY, AN HONEST ANSWER.
HOW REFRESHING.

27:05.057 --> 27:07.293
- ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT?
- NOT AT ALL.

27:07.326 --> 27:09.896
I'M ALL IN FAVOR
OF PEOPLE MAKING MONEY.

27:09.929 --> 27:12.398
WHAT I'M NOT IN FAVOR OF IS
TELLING OTHERS HOW TO SPEND IT.

27:12.431 --> 27:15.267
- IT'S FOR A WORTHY CAUSE.
BESIDES, THEY CAN AFFORD IT.

27:15.301 --> 27:17.069
- THAT'S VERY TRUE.

27:17.103 --> 27:21.140
BUT IT'S NOT A REASON
WHY THEY SHOULD GIVE IT TO YOU.

27:21.173 --> 27:23.409
- WELL, HOW ABOUT THIS THEN?

27:23.442 --> 27:25.444
IT WOULDN'T BE VERY GOOD
FOR YOUR CLIENTS' P.R.

27:25.477 --> 27:28.180
IF THEY WERE PERCEIVED
AS BEING HOMOPHOBIC.

27:28.214 --> 27:29.949
AND IT WOULDN'T HELP
YOUR REPUTATION MUCH

27:29.982 --> 27:32.018
IF WORD GOT OUT
THAT YOU WERE INSENSITIVE

27:32.051 --> 27:34.286
TO THE NEEDIEST MEMBERS
OF YOUR COMMUNITY.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.055
- [chuckles]

27:36.088 --> 27:38.825
WHY, JEFFREY, ARE YOU
TURNING THE SCREWS ON ME?

27:38.858 --> 27:42.061
- COURSE NOT.

27:42.094 --> 27:44.030
I'M MERELY POINTING OUT
WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT

27:44.063 --> 27:46.198
THAT WE ALL OPEN
OUR HEARTS AND CHECKBOOKS

27:46.232 --> 27:49.836
AND GIVE AS GENEROUSLY
AS WE CAN.

27:51.270 --> 27:53.973
- [breathing heavily]

27:56.275 --> 27:58.477
- [breathing heavily]

27:58.510 --> 28:02.982
[crowd cheering]

28:06.853 --> 28:08.254
- BLUE 44.

28:08.287 --> 28:10.089
BLUE 44.

28:10.122 --> 28:11.924
BLUE 44.

28:11.958 --> 28:14.360
SET. HIKE.

28:14.393 --> 28:20.132
[players grunting]

28:21.768 --> 28:25.337
- GO, BOYD.
- GET PAST THOSE MOTHERFUCKERS!

28:25.371 --> 28:27.106
- RUN, DAMN IT.
RUN!

28:27.139 --> 28:30.076
[crowd cheering]

28:30.109 --> 28:32.078
- [blows whistle]

28:32.111 --> 28:35.081
[techno music]

28:35.114 --> 28:36.415
*

28:36.448 --> 28:39.485
- OH, MY GOD!
DID YOU SEE THAT?

28:39.518 --> 28:41.387
- MWAH!

28:41.420 --> 28:46.959
- * [vocalizing]

28:46.993 --> 28:49.161
- THAT WAS SOME PLAY, HUH?
- I'LL SAY.

28:49.195 --> 28:51.864
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GOT
THESE TICKETS, IN THE SKYBOX.

28:51.898 --> 28:54.100
- I'M GLAD
YOU'RE HAVING A GOOD TIME.

28:54.133 --> 28:55.902
- WELL, I'LL TELL YOU
THE TRUTH, I'M NOT.

28:55.935 --> 28:58.838
- YOU'RE NOT?
- I'M HAVING A GREAT TIME!

28:58.871 --> 29:00.840
- OH.
[laughs]

29:00.873 --> 29:02.775
I HOPE
KATHERINE DOESN'T MIND.

29:02.809 --> 29:05.111
- THAT I WENT TO THE GAME
WITH A FRIEND?

29:05.144 --> 29:06.512
- CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS
IS THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE

29:06.545 --> 29:08.380
I'VE EVER BEEN
TO A FOOTBALL GAME?

29:08.414 --> 29:09.882
- EASILY.

29:09.916 --> 29:12.051
- I HAD NO IDEA
IT'D BE SO EXCITING.

29:12.084 --> 29:14.286
I FEEL LIKE
WE'RE BACK IN ANCIENT ROME,

29:14.320 --> 29:16.055
YOU KNOW,
SITTING IN THE COLOSSEUM,

29:16.088 --> 29:18.390
WATCHING THE GLADIATORS,

29:18.424 --> 29:20.559
WEARING THOSE FABULOUS
OFF-THE-SHOULDER TOGAS.

29:20.592 --> 29:23.029
- YEAH, SOMEHOW, I PICTURE US
MORE AS LION CHOW,

29:23.062 --> 29:26.198
BUT I'M GLAD
YOU'RE ENJOYING IT.

29:26.232 --> 29:27.800
IN FACT, YOU HAVEN'T TAKEN
YOUR EYES OFF OF DREW BOYD

29:27.834 --> 29:29.301
SINCE WE SAT DOWN.

29:29.335 --> 29:31.570
- THAT'S JUST BECAUSE
HE'S SUCH A DYNAMIC

29:31.603 --> 29:33.039
AND POWERFUL PLAYER.

29:33.072 --> 29:36.042
- ADMIT IT,
YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH HIM.

29:36.075 --> 29:37.944
- AM NOT.
- [chuckles]

29:37.977 --> 29:39.045
AFTER SEEING HIM
IN HIS UNDERWEAR,

29:39.078 --> 29:40.579
I HAVE TO CONFESS,
SO AM I.

29:40.612 --> 29:43.149
[laughs]
- OH.

29:43.182 --> 29:44.183
- HI.

29:44.216 --> 29:45.584
- DREW JUST SCORED.

29:45.617 --> 29:48.587
- I DIDN'T DO SO BAD MYSELF.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.289
- OH, MY GOD.

29:50.322 --> 29:51.891
- WHAT?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

29:51.924 --> 29:54.293
- NOTHING.
UM, UH, COME ON, LET'S, UM--

29:54.326 --> 29:56.162
LET'S--LET'S GO.
- GO?

29:56.195 --> 29:57.363
GO? BUT THERE ARE SECONDS
LEFT ON THE CLOCK

29:57.396 --> 29:59.832
WITH A TIED SCORE.

29:59.866 --> 30:02.168
- EMMETT? IS THAT YOU?

30:02.201 --> 30:05.304
- OH, HI, SIERRA.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

30:05.337 --> 30:07.373
I DIDN'T EXACTLY THINK
FOOTBALL WAS YOUR THING.

30:07.406 --> 30:09.208
- UM, I'M HERE
WITH MY FRIEND, TED.

30:09.241 --> 30:11.243
HE'S THE ONE WHO PICKED DREW
FOR THE UNDERWEAR AD.

30:11.277 --> 30:13.079
- OH, SO YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE

30:13.112 --> 30:15.381
FOR ALL THOSE WOMEN DROOLING
WHEN THEY SEE THAT AD.

30:15.414 --> 30:19.351
- NOT TO MENTION A CERTAIN
SEGMENT OF THE MALE POPULATION.

30:19.385 --> 30:21.053
- I'M SIERRA, DREW'S FIANCEE.

30:21.087 --> 30:23.122
- OH, CONGRATULATIONS.
UH, HE'S QUITE A GUY.

30:23.155 --> 30:25.591
- YES, IT SEEMS
I LANDED THE BIG ONE.

30:25.624 --> 30:27.960
- YOU CERTAINLY DID.

30:27.994 --> 30:29.128
WELL, IT'S NICE
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

30:29.161 --> 30:30.196
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

30:30.229 --> 30:31.497
DREW WOULD BE SO DISAPPOINTED

30:31.530 --> 30:32.865
IF YOU DIDN'T STOP
BY THE LOCKER ROOM

30:32.899 --> 30:34.867
TO SAY HELLO.

30:34.901 --> 30:37.003
- I-I'D LOVE TO,
BUT WE'RE WITH FRIENDS.

30:37.036 --> 30:38.370
- SO BRING THEM ALONG.

30:38.404 --> 30:40.072
- I CAN MEET THE TEAM?

30:40.106 --> 30:42.942
- GOT ONE CHANCE.
- THIS IS IT!

30:42.975 --> 30:44.343
[whistle blows]
- TOUCHDOWN!

30:44.376 --> 30:45.945
[crowd cheering]

30:45.978 --> 30:48.480
- IRONMEN WIN!

30:48.514 --> 30:51.884
[techno music]

30:51.918 --> 30:56.355
[sports announcer
speaking indistinctly]

30:56.388 --> 30:58.290
- A VICTORY FOR THE IRONMEN.

30:58.324 --> 31:00.126
YOUR FINAL SCORE,
37 TO 31...

31:00.159 --> 31:01.994
- OKAY, EVERYONE,
FOLLOW ME.

31:02.028 --> 31:05.131
- WITH JUST A FEW TICKS
ON THE CLOCK.

31:05.164 --> 31:08.434
ISN'T THAT UNBELIEVABLE?

31:08.467 --> 31:12.404
- WHY WOULDN'T HE JUST COME OUT
AND SAY HE HAS A BOYFRIEND?

31:12.438 --> 31:15.007
- YOU KNOW HOW KIDS
HIS AGE ARE.

31:15.041 --> 31:16.675
HE'S TRYING TO DEVELOP
A SENSE OF SELF,

31:16.708 --> 31:20.546
WHICH OFTEN INCLUDES
NOT COMMUNICATING WITH PARENTS.

31:20.579 --> 31:22.648
- WE'RE NOT OTHER PARENTS.

31:22.681 --> 31:24.383
WE'RE HIP, YOU KNOW?
WE ARE...

31:24.416 --> 31:27.253
COOL.

31:27.286 --> 31:29.121
- YOU THINK SO?

31:29.155 --> 31:30.990
- HEY, PAL.

31:31.023 --> 31:33.259
- I ORDERED OUR FAVORITE:
"MIGHTY MAN MEAT."

31:33.292 --> 31:37.129
SAUSAGE, PEPPERONI,
MEATBALL, HAM, AND BACON.

31:37.163 --> 31:39.065
- OUCH!
- NOT TO WORRY.

31:39.098 --> 31:41.033
MUSHROOM AND TOFU FOR YOU.

31:41.067 --> 31:43.669
- SO, DUDE, WHAT'S NEW?

31:43.702 --> 31:45.938
- NOTHING, DUDE.

31:45.972 --> 31:49.541
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I HEAR.
SO YOU GOT A FRIEND.

31:49.575 --> 31:51.410
MICHAEL AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT WE THINK IT'S GREAT.

31:51.443 --> 31:54.280
IN FACT, I WISH I HAD
A BOYFRIEND WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE.

31:54.313 --> 31:55.681
- ALL THOSE MISSED BLOW JOBS.

31:55.714 --> 32:00.086
- SO WHAT IS HE LIKE, HUH?

32:00.119 --> 32:02.488
IS HE SMART, BOOKISH?

32:02.521 --> 32:05.324
- MUSCULAR, ATHLETIC?

32:05.357 --> 32:06.725
- ALL OF THE ABOVE.

32:06.758 --> 32:09.361
- YOU TWO HAD SEX YET?
- NO.

32:09.395 --> 32:11.597
- UH, IT'S OKAY.
WE'RE ALL GAY MEN HERE.

32:11.630 --> 32:14.366
BECAUSE IF YOU DO,
IT'S IMPORTANT YOU PROTECT HIM,

32:14.400 --> 32:18.504
AS WELL AS YOURSELF, ESPECIALLY
CONSIDERING YOUR HIV STATUS.

32:18.537 --> 32:20.106
YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY.

32:20.139 --> 32:24.510
- DON'T WORRY.
I'LL BE CAREFUL.

32:24.543 --> 32:27.079
- SO?

32:27.113 --> 32:28.447
WHEN DO WE GET TO MEET HIM?

32:28.480 --> 32:30.382
- I DON'T KNOW.

32:30.416 --> 32:32.184
- WE'RE VERY OPEN-MINDED.

32:32.218 --> 32:35.721
- DOESN'T MATTER IF HE
HAS TATTOOS, BODY PIERCINGS.

32:35.754 --> 32:38.690
HE DOESN'T, DOES HE?

32:43.229 --> 32:46.332
- LOOK...

32:46.365 --> 32:49.368
I DON'T HAVE A...

32:49.401 --> 32:51.170
BOYFRIEND, OKAY?

32:54.373 --> 32:57.343
- W-WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU TOLD ME--

32:57.376 --> 33:00.512
- I TOLD YOU I HAD A FRIEND.

33:00.546 --> 33:04.750
I DIDN'T SAY IT WAS A BOY.

33:04.783 --> 33:07.153
- WELL, IF IT'S NOT A BOY...

33:07.186 --> 33:10.489
- IT'S A...

33:10.522 --> 33:12.124
[clicks tongue]

33:20.799 --> 33:22.434
[indistinct chatter]

33:22.468 --> 33:25.237
- HEY.
- HEY, HON.

33:25.271 --> 33:28.040
DREW, THIS IS CARL AND DEBBIE,
AND YOU REMEMBER TED.

33:28.074 --> 33:29.441
- IT'S A REAL THRILL,
MR. BOYD.

33:29.475 --> 33:32.244
- CALL ME DREW.
- DREW. YEAH.

33:32.278 --> 33:33.645
- YOU WERE AMAZING
OUT THERE, DREW.

33:33.679 --> 33:36.115
- OH, THANK YOU.
- I'LL SAY.

33:36.148 --> 33:37.416
HE'S FUCKING CUTE TOO.

33:37.449 --> 33:38.817
[laughs]
SO WHEN'S THE WEDDING?

33:38.850 --> 33:40.119
both: JUNE.

33:40.152 --> 33:42.321
[both laugh]

33:42.354 --> 33:44.190
- OH, UH, SWEETHEART,
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

33:44.223 --> 33:45.824
EMMETT HONEYCUTT, REMEMBER?

33:45.857 --> 33:49.828
HE PLANNED
OUR ENGAGEMENT DINNER.

33:49.861 --> 33:52.198
- YEAH, SURE.

33:52.231 --> 33:53.665
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

33:53.699 --> 33:57.603
I'M GONNA TAKE MY HONEY HOME
AND CHILL OUT.

34:01.373 --> 34:03.609
- SEE YOU, EMMETT.
NICE MEETING EVERYONE.

34:03.642 --> 34:05.577
- BYE.

34:07.479 --> 34:09.081
- CHAMPAGNE?

34:09.115 --> 34:12.451
- NO, THANKS.
IT MAKES ME PUKE.

34:14.320 --> 34:15.554
I'M SERIOUS.

34:15.587 --> 34:17.823
I COULD KNOCK BACK
A DOZEN TEQUILAS,

34:17.856 --> 34:19.691
NO PROBLEMO.

34:19.725 --> 34:23.462
ONE GLASS OF THAT STUFF
AND IT'S "OU EST LA TOILETTE?"

34:23.495 --> 34:24.696
- THAT'S TOO BAD.

34:24.730 --> 34:25.764
YOU KNOW, THIS CHAMPAGNE
IS REALLY VERY--

34:25.797 --> 34:27.766
- EXPENSIVE, YEAH.

34:27.799 --> 34:31.537
WHAT IS THAT?
220 A POP?

34:34.606 --> 34:37.576
- WELL, IF YOU EXCUSE ME,
I'M GOING TO GO AND, UM...

34:37.609 --> 34:42.514
- AH.
PLEASE, BE MY GUEST.

34:51.923 --> 34:54.726
AND SOMETHING TELLS ME
I'M IN THE WRONG BUSINESS.

34:54.760 --> 34:58.464
- WHY IS THAT?
- THE SUITE, THE CHAMPAGNE.

34:58.497 --> 35:02.234
SEEMS LIKE CHARITY WORK'S WHERE
THE BIG BUCKS ARE THESE DAYS.

35:02.268 --> 35:04.270
- LIKE I SAID,
IT'S A LIVING.

35:04.303 --> 35:07.473
- YEAH, A VERY GOOD LIVING.
- SO...

35:07.506 --> 35:10.209
I ASSUME YOU'VE GIVEN
OUR CONVERSATION SOME THOUGHT.

35:10.242 --> 35:11.410
- YEAH, I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

35:11.443 --> 35:12.811
BUT BEFORE I GET
INTO BED WITH SOMEONE,

35:12.844 --> 35:14.546
I LIKE TO DO
A LITTLE RESEARCH.

35:14.580 --> 35:16.748
UH, YOU JUST CAN'T BE
TOO CAREFUL THESE DAYS.

35:16.782 --> 35:20.352
- ISN'T THAT THE TRUTH?

35:20.386 --> 35:21.787
SO WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT?

35:21.820 --> 35:24.256
- UH, THAT YOU'RE A HELL
OF A FUND-RAISER.

35:24.290 --> 35:26.625
- [chuckles]
WELL...

35:26.658 --> 35:28.394
I'M SORRY YOU WASTED
THE LEGWORK THERE.

35:28.427 --> 35:29.695
I COULD'VE TOLD YOU THAT.

35:29.728 --> 35:31.230
- DO YOU MIND?

35:31.263 --> 35:34.566
- BE MY GUEST.

35:34.600 --> 35:37.569
- IT SEEMS
THAT THE ORGANIZATIONS,

35:37.603 --> 35:40.372
THEY DON'T SEE MUCH
IN THE END,

35:40.406 --> 35:43.642
WHAT WITH THE FANCY HOTELS
AND CHAMPAGNE, CAVIAR,

35:43.675 --> 35:47.379
LAVISH KICKOFF PARTIES,
WHICH, BY THE WAY,

35:47.413 --> 35:51.817
THE CHARITIES PAY FOR,
NOT YOU.

35:51.850 --> 35:55.787
- FOR HOW HARD I WORK
AND FOR THE AMOUNT I BRING IN,

35:55.821 --> 35:59.325
I DESERVE A NICE LIFESTYLE.

35:59.358 --> 36:01.327
BESIDES, EVERYONE PROFITS.

36:01.360 --> 36:04.330
TAX WRITE-OFFS,
GOODWILL, PUBLICITY.

36:04.363 --> 36:05.531
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM,
AS LONG AS EVERYTHING'S

36:05.564 --> 36:06.832
ON THE UP AND UP?

36:06.865 --> 36:09.801
- WHAT ABOUT DENVER?

36:09.835 --> 36:11.403
- WHAT ABOUT DENVER?

36:11.437 --> 36:13.539
- WELL, DIDN'T SOME
LOCAL AIDS ORGANIZATION

36:13.572 --> 36:15.841
SUE YOU FOR SWINDLING THEM
OUT OF MONEY

36:15.874 --> 36:17.943
THAT YOU SPENT
ON YOURSELF?

36:17.976 --> 36:20.346
- THOSE WERE--
[sighs]

36:20.379 --> 36:23.415
THOSE WERE TOTALLY LEGITIMATE
BUSINESS EXPENSES--

36:23.449 --> 36:24.950
OFFICE, TRAVEL.

36:24.983 --> 36:26.418
- MORE CAVIAR?

36:26.452 --> 36:28.320
- NO, THANKS. I--

36:36.362 --> 36:37.729
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
BRIAN?

36:37.763 --> 36:40.332
- JUST THAT WHEN
SOME EARNEST DO-GOODER

36:40.366 --> 36:41.900
BLOWS INTO TOWN
AND STARTS THREATENING ME

36:41.933 --> 36:43.835
UNLESS I HELP HIM,
I HAVE A LEGITIMATE REASON

36:43.869 --> 36:46.838
TO ASK A FEW QUESTIONS...

36:46.872 --> 36:49.508
AND GET A FEW ANSWERS.

36:49.541 --> 36:53.011
- THOSE ACCUSATIONS WERE TOTALLY
UNTRUE AND UNSUBSTANTIATED.

36:53.044 --> 36:54.446
AND WHAT THEY
DIDN'T TELL YOU

36:54.480 --> 36:56.315
IS THEY STILL
MADE 1/4 MILLION

36:56.348 --> 36:57.883
EVEN AFTER MY SHARE.

36:57.916 --> 36:59.618
- HMM.

36:59.651 --> 37:03.855
GOD, IMAGINE WHAT
THEY WOULD'VE MADE BEFORE IT.

37:03.889 --> 37:05.857
SO WE'LL JUST MAKE SURE
THAT EVERY CENT YOU RAISE HERE

37:05.891 --> 37:07.493
IN PROVINCIAL
LITTLE PITTSBURGH

37:07.526 --> 37:11.363
GOES EXACTLY
WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO GO.

37:13.365 --> 37:15.734
[champagne pouring]

37:15.767 --> 37:17.002
[doorbell rings]

37:17.035 --> 37:18.036

OH. OH. OH.
[laughs]

37:20.506 --> 37:22.374
LOOK, GUS, IT'S SAM.

37:22.408 --> 37:23.942
HE LOVES ANSWERING THE DOOR.

37:23.975 --> 37:24.943
COME ON IN.
- THANKS.

37:24.976 --> 37:25.944

- YEAH.

37:25.977 --> 37:28.514
LINZ, SAM'S HERE!

37:28.547 --> 37:31.049
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR SHOW.
I HEARD IT'S A SMASH.

37:31.082 --> 37:32.484
- AH, THEY ALWAYS ARE.

37:32.518 --> 37:34.953
BUT THIS ONE
WAS THANKS TO LINDSAY.

37:34.986 --> 37:37.489
I'M OFF TO MILAN.

37:37.523 --> 37:39.425
- THAT SHOULD BE A STEP UP
FROM PITTSBURGH.

37:39.458 --> 37:40.659
- [laughs]

37:40.692 --> 37:41.660
- ALTHOUGH I DOUBT
YOU'LL FIND

37:41.693 --> 37:43.629
A DECENT BAGEL THERE EITHER.

37:43.662 --> 37:47.899
- JUST WANTED TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

37:47.933 --> 37:50.902
- WHY DON'T I WALK YOU
TO YOUR CAR?

37:50.936 --> 37:52.938
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
- YEAH.

37:58.810 --> 38:00.045
MWAH.

38:00.078 --> 38:01.647
- I COULDN'T
JUST LEAVE WITHOUT--

38:01.680 --> 38:03.682
- YES, YOU COULD.
AND YOU SHOULD RIGHT NOW.

38:03.715 --> 38:05.050
- WITHOUT EVEN
SAYING GOOD-BYE?

38:05.083 --> 38:06.518
- I'M SURE
THERE ARE DOZENS OF WOMEN

38:06.552 --> 38:08.554
YOU'VE FUCKED
WITHOUT SAYING GOOD-BYE.

38:08.587 --> 38:10.656
- YOU KNOW
IT WASN'T JUST A FUCK,

38:10.689 --> 38:11.990
THAT IT MEANT MORE THAN THAT.

38:12.023 --> 38:16.395
THAT YOU MEAN--
- WOULD YOU JUST STOP?

38:16.428 --> 38:19.931
PLEASE?

38:19.965 --> 38:21.533
- I WANT YOU TO COME WITH ME.

38:21.567 --> 38:23.669
- WHAT?

38:23.702 --> 38:24.936
ARE YOU CRAZY?

38:24.970 --> 38:26.805
- DAMN PROUD OF IT TOO.

38:26.838 --> 38:29.074
LOOK, I HAVE MORE EX-WIVES

38:29.107 --> 38:31.076
AND MISTRESSES
THAN SEARS HAS TIRE CENTERS.

38:31.109 --> 38:32.678
- I'M SURE THEY'D BE PLEASED
TO HEAR THEMSELVES

38:32.711 --> 38:34.079
COMPARED
TO A STEEL-BELTED RADIAL.

38:34.112 --> 38:35.080
- IF YOU'D MET THEM,
YOU'D REALIZE

38:35.113 --> 38:37.849
THAT WAS A COMPLIMENT.

38:37.883 --> 38:40.852
BUT I'VE NEVER FELT LIKE THIS.

38:41.887 --> 38:44.089
LOOK...

38:44.122 --> 38:45.857
JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

38:45.891 --> 38:47.025
I CAN SEND YOU A TICKET.

38:47.058 --> 38:49.861
- I HAVE A FAMILY, SAM...

38:49.895 --> 38:51.563
RIGHT THERE,

38:51.597 --> 38:53.098
ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THAT DOOR.

38:53.131 --> 38:55.100
- BUT THAT'S NOT ALL YOU ARE.

38:55.133 --> 38:57.469
THERE'S SO MUCH MORE TO YOU
THAN THAT.

38:57.503 --> 38:58.470
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME SHOW YOU?

38:58.504 --> 39:01.440
- NO!

39:01.473 --> 39:04.876
THIS IS WHO I AM.

39:04.910 --> 39:07.979
AND EVEN IF A PART,
A VERY TINY PART OF ME,

39:08.013 --> 39:11.049
WANTED SOMETHING ELSE...

39:11.082 --> 39:15.787
I'D STILL CHOOSE
TO STAY HERE.

39:15.821 --> 39:19.425
NOW I WANT YOU TO GO.

39:43.515 --> 39:47.486
[car engine turns over]

39:47.519 --> 39:50.589
[deep sigh]

39:52.924 --> 39:54.192

39:54.225 --> 39:58.196
IT'S A PERSIAN MELON
FROM CHILE.

39:58.229 --> 40:03.201
- WELL, THAT'S VERY STRANGE,
CARL, BUT SWEET.

40:03.234 --> 40:05.904
- WE WERE INVESTIGATING
A MURDER, UH,

40:05.937 --> 40:09.508
NEAR THE FRUIT
AND VEGETABLE MARKET, SO I--

40:09.541 --> 40:11.042
- DON'T TELL ME THOSE
KILLER TOMATOES ARE AT IT AGAIN.

40:11.076 --> 40:12.711
[both laughing]

40:12.744 --> 40:14.513
- I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU
SOMETHING, YOU KNOW,

40:14.546 --> 40:16.815
AS A THANK-YOU
FOR TAKING ME TO THE GAME.

40:16.848 --> 40:19.451
- MY PLEASURE.
- AND FOR MEETING DREW BOYD.

40:19.485 --> 40:22.187
WOW.
I STILL CAN'T GET OVER THAT.

40:22.220 --> 40:24.990
- YEAH, HE'S REALLY SOMETHING.

40:25.023 --> 40:27.125
- SO ARE YOU.

40:27.158 --> 40:29.928
FOR BEING SUCH A GOOD FRIEND,
I MEAN.

40:29.961 --> 40:32.197
- [sighs]

40:32.230 --> 40:35.567
I'LL ALWAYS BE YOUR FRIEND.

40:37.836 --> 40:41.807
COULD I OFFER YOU
A FRIENDLY SLICE OF MELON?

40:41.840 --> 40:45.043
- NO, THANKS.
UH, I OUGHT TO BE GOING.

40:46.912 --> 40:50.849
- MAYBE WE COULD DO SOMETHING
ELSE FRIENDLY SOMETIME.

40:50.882 --> 40:52.718
- YEAH, I'D LIKE THAT.

40:52.751 --> 40:57.823
- LIKE BOWLING
OR FISHING OR...

40:57.856 --> 41:00.759
- OR THIS.

41:07.599 --> 41:10.836
- WAS THAT A FRIENDLY KISS?

41:10.869 --> 41:15.641
- YEAH, I-I GUESS
YOU COULD SAY THAT.

41:15.674 --> 41:19.611
- IN THAT CASE, IT COULD BE
A LITTLE FRIENDLIER.

- * I CAN HEAR IT
LIKE A SHOUT OUT LOUD *

41:33.792 --> 41:36.161
* THE SECOND HAND SPINNING

41:36.194 --> 41:39.598
* I WAIT FOR YOU

41:39.631 --> 41:44.002
* WORK YOUR WAY HOME
IN TRAFFIC OR CROWDS *

41:44.035 --> 41:49.274
* YOU DON'T MEAN TO BE LATE,
NOTHING YOU COULD DO *

41:49.307 --> 41:54.680
* ANY REASON AT ALL IS FINE

41:54.713 --> 41:57.683
* I'M A REASONABLE GIRL

41:57.716 --> 42:00.318
* AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE

42:00.351 --> 42:05.691
* I'LL TRY NOT TO WORRY,
HAVE A GLASS OF WINE *

42:05.724 --> 42:09.895
* AS LONG AS YOU'RE MINE

42:09.928 --> 42:11.196
*

42:11.229 --> 42:18.069
* CANDLES ARE BURNING DOWN

42:18.103 --> 42:21.640
*

42:21.673 --> 42:28.046
* I'M WAITING FOR THE SOUND

42:28.079 --> 42:30.916
- [sighs]

42:30.949 --> 42:33.184
*

42:33.218 --> 42:37.322
- DO YOU THINK
MAYBE IT'S JUST A PHASE?

42:37.355 --> 42:42.227
THAT MAYBE HE HASN'T MET
THE RIGHT BOY.

42:42.260 --> 42:43.829
- SUBSTITUTE "RIGHT GIRL"

42:43.862 --> 42:45.130
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT MY PARENTS SAID

42:45.163 --> 42:47.666
WHEN I TOLD THEM I WAS GAY.

42:47.699 --> 42:50.001
- BUT WHAT ABOUT ALL THE MEN?

42:50.035 --> 42:53.071
HE'S HAD SEX WITH MORE GUYS
THAN YOU AND I PUT TOGETHER.

42:53.104 --> 42:56.074
- HIS MOTHER
GOT HIM STARTED ON THAT,

42:56.107 --> 42:59.678
AND IT WAS ALWAYS FOR MONEY,
NOT LOVE.

42:59.711 --> 43:01.680
- DO YOU THINK IT'S TRUE?

43:01.713 --> 43:04.616
- SOUNDS LIKE HE'S DISCOVERED
WHO HE REALLY IS.

43:04.650 --> 43:06.685
AND IT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE

43:06.718 --> 43:10.121
ANY MORE THAN YOU AND I
COULD CHANGE WHO WE ARE.

43:10.155 --> 43:11.356
- WELL, WHAT ARE WE
GOING TO DO?

43:11.389 --> 43:14.760
I MEAN, TALKING ABOUT GIRLS,
WOMEN--

43:14.793 --> 43:16.027
I WOULDN'T KNOW
THE FIRST THING.

43:16.061 --> 43:19.164
I'VE NEVER EVEN SLEPT
WITH ONE.

43:19.197 --> 43:22.100
- HMM.

43:22.133 --> 43:24.703
I HAVE...

43:24.736 --> 43:26.037
ONCE OR TWICE.

43:26.071 --> 43:29.708
- REALLY?
- MM-HMM.

43:29.741 --> 43:31.777
- HOW WAS IT?

43:31.810 --> 43:33.378
- IT WAS ALL RIGHT.

43:33.411 --> 43:36.314
GOT A HARD-ON
AND EVERYTHING, AND...

43:36.347 --> 43:38.149
I SUPPOSE
I PERFORMED ADEQUATELY.

43:38.183 --> 43:41.252
AT LEAST NO ONE COMPLAINED.

43:41.286 --> 43:44.155
BUT I ALSO REMEMBER
THINKING...

43:44.189 --> 43:46.057
"WHY ARE GUYS
SO OBSESSED WITH THIS?

43:46.091 --> 43:48.159
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?"

43:48.193 --> 43:51.396
- HMM, I GUESS
THAT WAS THE FIRST CLUE.

43:51.429 --> 43:52.998
- HMM.

43:53.031 --> 43:57.335
THAT AND LIKING TO WEAR
MY MOM'S DRESSES.

43:57.368 --> 44:01.006
JUST KIDDING.
[chuckles]

44:01.039 --> 44:04.876
- SO WE'RE BOTH PRETTY USELESS
WHEN IT COMES TO GUY STUFF.

44:04.910 --> 44:08.747
- SOMEONE ELSE WILL HAVE
TO DIRECT HIM TO THE G-SPOT.

44:08.780 --> 44:11.082
I NEVER COULD FIND IT.

44:11.116 --> 44:12.450
- HE CAN ASK MEL AND LINZ.

44:12.483 --> 44:15.653
I'M SURE THEY KNOW
WHERE IT IS.

44:20.458 --> 44:23.762
BEN...

44:23.795 --> 44:27.365
DO YOU THINK
HE'D BE BETTER OFF WITH...

44:27.398 --> 44:29.400
STRAIGHT PARENTS?

44:31.870 --> 44:34.439
- WHAT?

44:34.472 --> 44:39.377
- PEOPLE WHO'LL UNDERSTAND HIM.

44:39.410 --> 44:41.346
- WE UNDERSTAND HIM.

44:41.379 --> 44:43.782
HE'S STILL HUNTER.

44:43.815 --> 44:47.385
GAY OR STRAIGHT,
IT DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

44:56.361 --> 45:00.065
- IT MAY NOT MAKE
A DIFFERENCE TO US,

45:00.098 --> 45:03.835
BUT WHAT ABOUT HIM?

45:06.104 --> 45:07.405
[indistinct chatter]

45:07.438 --> 45:09.240
- THAT'S OUR BOY, DREW.

45:09.274 --> 45:10.976
- YEAH.

45:11.009 --> 45:14.412
- CHRIST, LOOK AT HIM GO.
AH.

45:14.445 --> 45:17.515
HE CAN DO ANYTHING.
RUN, THROW, BLOCK.

45:17.548 --> 45:19.217
- FUCK YOU LIKE A PISTON.

45:19.250 --> 45:20.418
- [scoffs]
YEAH.

45:20.451 --> 45:22.520
- MAKE THAT "FUCK ME."

45:22.553 --> 45:26.491
AND DID HE EVER,
IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY.

45:26.524 --> 45:28.126
- WHAT ARE YOU DRINKING?

45:28.159 --> 45:31.262
- NOTHING, UNFORTUNATELY.

45:32.931 --> 45:36.167
YOU MIGHT AS WELL KNOW,
TEDDY, UM...

45:36.201 --> 45:40.171
DREW BOYD AND I
HAVE BEEN HAVING AN AFFAIR.

45:46.411 --> 45:48.379
- [laughs]

45:48.413 --> 45:50.148
NO.
NO, YOU DON'T.

45:50.181 --> 45:51.983
NO, NO, NO, NO, YOU--
YOU SAID YOU'D GET BACK AT ME

45:52.017 --> 45:53.852
THAT TIME I TOLD YOU
I MET GREG LOUGANIS

45:53.885 --> 45:55.420
DOWN IN BARBADOS
AND SUCKED HIM OFF UNDERWATER,

45:55.453 --> 45:58.023
AND YOU BELIEVED ME, BUT--
[laughs]

45:58.056 --> 46:00.391
NO, TOO SMART FOR YOU.

46:00.425 --> 46:01.392
[laughs]

46:01.426 --> 46:05.396
- I'M SERIOUS.

46:05.430 --> 46:08.766
- COME ON, YOU DON'T
EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE--

46:11.502 --> 46:13.939
BUT THAT--
[stammering]

46:13.972 --> 46:16.808
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
HE'S STRAIGHT.

46:16.842 --> 46:19.477
- TELL MY ASS THAT.

46:19.510 --> 46:20.812
WE'VE BEEN MEETING
THREE TIMES A WEEK

46:20.846 --> 46:23.281
IN THIS LITTLE MOTEL.

46:23.314 --> 46:27.585
I SWORE TO HIM I'D NEVER TELL.

46:27.618 --> 46:31.489
BUT NOW IT'S OVER.

46:31.522 --> 46:34.459
AND THE WORST PART OF IT IS...

46:34.492 --> 46:38.897
I WAS FALLING IN LOVE
WITH THE SON OF A BITCH.

46:38.930 --> 46:40.165
[patrons cheering]

46:40.198 --> 46:43.034
- ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!
TOUCHDOWN!

46:43.068 --> 46:48.974
[indistinct chatter]

46:55.981 --> 46:59.584
- YOUR BARCELONA CHAIR WILL
LOOK GREAT IN THE LIVING ROOM.

46:59.617 --> 47:01.452
- THANKS FOR DONATING IT FOR ME.

47:01.486 --> 47:03.088
- HEY, GENE,
I GOT BRIAN TO DONATE

47:03.121 --> 47:04.923
HIS $2,000 BARCELONA CHAIR.

47:04.956 --> 47:07.192
- WITHHOLDING SEX
HAS WORKED FOR CENTURIES.

47:07.225 --> 47:10.195
- THANKS, BUT BEFORE
WE CAN THINK OF REDECORATING,

47:10.228 --> 47:12.931
WE'RE GOING TO NEED A ROOF
OVER OUR HEADS.

47:12.964 --> 47:15.633
YOU KNOW THE GUY WHO WAS
ORGANIZING THE LIBERTY RIDE?

47:15.666 --> 47:17.202
- JEFFREY PENDERGRASS?

47:17.235 --> 47:18.970
- HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
AT A MEETING LAST NIGHT

47:19.004 --> 47:19.971
AT THE CENTER.

47:20.005 --> 47:21.372
WHEN HE DIDN'T SHOW UP,

47:21.406 --> 47:23.008
THEY CALLED HIS HOTEL.

47:23.041 --> 47:25.076
HE'D CHECKED OUT.

47:25.110 --> 47:26.111
- CHECKED OUT?

47:26.144 --> 47:28.246
- SEEMS HE RESIGNED.

47:28.279 --> 47:30.248
- AND WHAT ABOUT
THE DONATIONS?

47:30.281 --> 47:33.084
- HE SENT A LETTER
SAYING THAT THEY ALMOST,

47:33.118 --> 47:36.154
BUT NOT QUITE,
COVERED HIS EXPENSES.

47:36.187 --> 47:38.089
- OH, SHIT.

47:38.123 --> 47:40.491
- THE ONE THING WE HAD,
EVEN WHEN WE DIDN'T HAVE FUNDS,

47:40.525 --> 47:42.260
WAS HOPE.

47:42.293 --> 47:45.663
AND NOW,
WE DON'T EVEN HAVE THAT.

47:45.696 --> 47:48.166
- [clears throat]

47:54.139 --> 47:56.407
- WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO?
- LAMAZE.

47:56.441 --> 47:58.143
- WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SOMETHING?
I'LL JUST BE A MINUTE.

47:58.176 --> 48:01.412
- NO NEED.
MICHAEL'S MEETING ME THERE.

48:01.446 --> 48:03.081
- MICHAEL?

48:03.114 --> 48:05.183
- HE'S A VERY GOOD COACH.

48:05.216 --> 48:08.453
- I'M SURE,
BUT WHAT ABOUT ME?

48:08.486 --> 48:12.257
- I FIGURED YOU HAD BUSINESS
WITH SAM AT THE GALLERY.

48:12.290 --> 48:14.125
- SAM'S GONE.

48:14.159 --> 48:17.062
- AH, BUT NOT FORGOTTEN.

48:20.198 --> 48:21.399
I WATCHED YOU TWO
FROM THE WINDOW.

48:21.432 --> 48:22.567
IT WAS A...

48:22.600 --> 48:26.437
VERY TOUCHING GOOD-BYE SCENE.

48:26.471 --> 48:30.008
- HE'S MY FRIEND,
MY MENTOR.

48:30.041 --> 48:33.578
HE--HE'S--
- AWAKENED THINGS IN YOU?

48:33.611 --> 48:37.448
YOUR DESIRE TO PAINT,
TO EXPRESS YOURSELF.

48:37.482 --> 48:40.585
ANYTHING ELSE?

48:58.469 --> 49:01.472
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME.

49:04.775 --> 49:07.345
I KNOW.

49:11.149 --> 49:15.086
YOU DON'T LIVE WITH SOMEONE
FOR NINE YEARS AND NOT KNOW.

49:17.388 --> 49:19.190
[exhales tremulously]

49:19.224 --> 49:21.092
- MEL...

49:21.126 --> 49:24.395
- I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANY
OF YOUR BULLSHIT EXPLANATIONS.

49:24.429 --> 49:27.365
- I WASN'T GOING TO OFFER ANY.

49:29.367 --> 49:32.470
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS...

49:32.503 --> 49:37.275
IT RECONFIRMED FOR ME
THAT THIS IS WHO I AM.

49:37.308 --> 49:43.081
THAT MY LIFE
IS WITH YOU AND GUS...

49:43.114 --> 49:45.583
AND THE BABY.

49:49.054 --> 49:52.357
THAT I STILL CHOOSE YOU.

49:52.390 --> 49:54.659
- HUH.

49:54.692 --> 49:59.097
THAT'S VERY CONVINCING
TESTIMONY.

49:59.130 --> 50:01.766
BUT I'M NOT SO SURE THAT

50:01.799 --> 50:04.702
I STILL CHOOSE YOU.

50:06.404 --> 50:08.739
[door opens]

50:21.186 --> 50:24.155
[I Look to You]

50:24.189 --> 50:26.391
*

50:26.424 --> 50:29.594
- * IF THERE
WAS THE SLIGHTEST CHANCE *

50:29.627 --> 50:32.530
* THAT I WOULD LEAVE YOU

50:32.563 --> 50:37.168
* THERE'S A GREATER CHANCE
THAT I NEVER WILL *

50:37.202 --> 50:38.803
*

50:38.836 --> 50:42.140
* BECAUSE YOU KEEP ME
COMING BACK *

50:42.173 --> 50:45.143
* TO THE BEGINNING

50:45.176 --> 50:50.148
* YOU KEEP ME DRINKING
TILL I'VE HAD MY FILL *

50:50.181 --> 50:51.549
*

50:51.582 --> 50:54.552
* I CAN'T SAY,
I WON'T SAY *

50:54.585 --> 50:57.555
* THAT IT'S CONFUSING

50:57.588 --> 51:00.691
* I LOOK TO YOU

51:00.725 --> 51:03.828
* MY ONLY ONE

51:03.861 --> 51:07.165
* I LOOK TO YOU

51:07.198 --> 51:10.235
* YOUR FATHER'S SON

51:10.268 --> 51:13.371
* I LOOK TO YOU

51:13.404 --> 51:16.507
* INSIDE MY PAIN

51:16.541 --> 51:19.210
* AND I WAIT

51:19.244 --> 51:22.313
* I WAIT FOR YOU AGAIN

51:22.347 --> 51:26.651
* I LOOK TO YOU

51:26.684 --> 51:28.819
*

51:35.393 --> 51:38.596
* TURN BACK THE HANDS
OF TIME *

51:38.629 --> 51:41.666
* TO THE BEGINNING

51:41.699 --> 51:44.902
* WHEN WE WERE JOINED
ALL THE TIME *

51:44.935 --> 51:48.506
* IN A NEW BEGINNING

51:48.539 --> 51:54.412
* KEEP ME COMING BACK,
BACK TO THE BEGINNING *

51:54.445 --> 51:57.548
* I LOOK TO YOU

51:57.582 --> 52:00.751
* MY ONLY ONE

52:00.785 --> 52:04.155
* I LOOK TO YOU

52:04.189 --> 52:07.158
* YOUR FATHER'S SON

52:07.192 --> 52:10.428
* I LOOK TO YOU

52:10.461 --> 52:13.631
* INSIDE MY PAIN

52:13.664 --> 52:16.267
