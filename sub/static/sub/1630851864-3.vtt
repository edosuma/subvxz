he dives

his reputation

attracts available young women
who jump into the river

12:10.012 --> 12:13.806
to help him bathe,
but Lam-Ang has his heart

12:13.882 --> 12:16.225

he has only heard of--

12:16.301 --> 12:19.779
The unspeakably beautiful
Ines Kannoyan,

and his chances with Ines--

12:59.177 --> 13:02.897

14:02.883 --> 14:04.717
I have heard
of this legend before,
