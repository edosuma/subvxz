>> THERE WAS ONE TIME YOU KICKED

09:44.466 --> 09:46.766
JANCO UNCHAINED TO THE CURB AT

09:46.833 --> 09:47.533
THAT YOU REFER TO IT ALL THE

09:47.600 --> 09:47.733
TIME.

09:47.800 --> 09:56.166
>> Bill: I LOVE DJANGO --

09:56.233 --> 09:58.333
DALTON IS A BOUNTY HUNTER

09:58.400 --> 10:01.133
CHARACTER, DJANGO THEY ARE

10:01.200 --> 10:01.433
CHARACTERS.

10:01.500 --> 10:03.633
DJANGO HAS TO BE AN ACTOR.

10:03.700 --> 10:05.166
THERE IS NOT ONE FRAME OF YOUR

10:05.233 --> 10:05.866
MOVIES THAT I HAVE NOT SEEN

10:05.933 --> 10:10.000
MULTIPLE TIMES.

10:10.066 --> 10:10.433
[APPLAUSE]

10:10.500 --> 10:11.933
>> THANK YOU, I APPRECIATE IT.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.466
>> Bill: IT'S TRUE.

10:15.533 --> 10:17.066
TO ME, YOUR LATEST ONE IS YOUR

10:17.133 --> 10:20.000
PEAK, THIS IS MY FAVORITE OF ALL

10:20.066 --> 10:20.200
TIME.

10:20.266 --> 10:22.400
SO WHAT IS THIS NONSENSE ABOUT

10:22.466 --> 10:24.700
YOUR ONLY GOING TO MAKE ONE MORE

10:24.766 --> 10:25.066
MOVIE?

10:25.133 --> 10:27.966
COME ON.

10:28.033 --> 10:32.000
BAD IDEA.

10:32.066 --> 10:37.000
>> LOOK...

10:37.066 --> 10:38.400
>> Bill: YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO

10:38.466 --> 10:39.000
QUIT AND YOU'RE AT THE TOP OF

10:39.066 --> 10:41.600
YOUR GAME.

10:41.666 --> 10:43.333
>> THAT'S WHY YOU WANT TO QUIT!

10:43.400 --> 10:45.133
>> Bill: HOW DO YOU KNOW

10:45.200 --> 10:45.900
WHAT'S THE TOP?

10:45.966 --> 10:48.266
>> BECAUSE I KNOW FILM HISTORY

10:48.333 --> 10:50.600
AND FROM HERE ON IN, DIRECTORS

10:50.666 --> 10:51.033
DO NOT GET BETTER.

10:51.100 --> 10:52.600
>> Bill: THAT'S A TERRIBLE

10:52.666 --> 10:54.333
IDEA, YOU'RE JUDGING YOURSELF BY

10:54.400 --> 10:56.533
OTHER PEOPLE HOW DO YOU FUCKING

10:56.600 --> 10:57.966
NO?

10:58.033 --> 10:58.433
YOU'RE 58?

10:58.500 --> 11:02.000
58 IS THE NEW 57.

11:02.066 --> 11:03.900
[LAUGHTER]

11:03.966 --> 11:05.166
>> I HAVEN'T RETIRED YET COME I

11:05.233 --> 11:07.300
STILL HAVE ANOTHER ONE TO GO.

11:07.366 --> 11:11.566
>> Bill: WHY JUST ONE?

11:11.633 --> 11:14.833
>> I DON'T HAVE -- I DON'T HAVE

11:14.900 --> 11:16.800
A REASON THAT I WOULDN'T WANT TO

11:16.866 --> 11:18.400
SAY OUT LOUD THAT'S GOING TO WIN

11:18.466 --> 11:19.766
ANY ARGUMENT IN A COURT OF

11:19.833 --> 11:20.233
PUBLIC OPINION OR THE

11:20.300 --> 11:22.833
SUPREME COURT OR ANYTHING LIKE

11:22.900 --> 11:26.166
THAT, BUT IT IS JUST AT THE SAME

11:26.233 --> 11:27.533
TIME, WORKING FOR 30 YEARS,

11:27.600 --> 11:29.333
DOING AS MANY MOVIES AS I'VE

11:29.400 --> 11:30.800
DONE WHICH IS NOT AS MANY AS

11:30.866 --> 11:32.300
OTHER PEOPLE BUT THAT'S A LONG

11:32.366 --> 11:34.466
CAREER, THAT'S A REALLY LONG

11:34.533 --> 11:35.366
CAREER.

11:35.433 --> 11:39.266
AND I'VE GIVEN IT EVERYTHING I

11:39.333 --> 11:41.266
HAVE, EVERY ANGLE SOLITARY THING

11:41.333 --> 11:41.500
I HAVE.

11:41.566 --> 11:42.500
>> Bill: YOU'LL BE BORED,

11:42.566 --> 11:46.666
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO IT.

11:46.733 --> 11:50.966
>> OKAY -- THIS IS A RANDOM

11:51.033 --> 11:53.833
EXAMPLE, RANDOM EXAMPLE BUT YOU

11:53.900 --> 11:55.366
LOOK AT A DIRECTOR LIKE DON

11:55.433 --> 11:59.100
SIEGEL WHO HAD ONE OF HIS BEST

11:59.166 --> 11:59.366
DECADES --

11:59.433 --> 12:00.866
>> Bill: DIRTY HARRY?

12:00.933 --> 12:02.900
>> HIS COLLABORATION WITH

12:02.966 --> 12:03.700
EASTWOOD.

12:03.766 --> 12:05.033
IF HE HAD QUIT HIS CAREER IN

12:05.100 --> 12:10.100
1979 WHEN HE DID ESCAPE FROM

12:10.166 --> 12:10.900
ALCATRAZ, WHAT A FINAL FILM!

12:10.966 --> 12:13.033
WHAT A MIC DROP BUT THEN HE

12:13.100 --> 12:15.200
DRIBBLES AWAY WITH TRICKLE MORE

12:15.266 --> 12:15.600
OTHER ONES.

12:15.666 --> 12:17.100
>> Bill: THAT'S DON SIEGEL,

12:17.166 --> 12:18.500
THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO HE IS

12:18.566 --> 12:20.966
SPIRIT >> BUT YOU KNOW WHO HE

12:21.033 --> 12:21.133
IS.

12:21.200 --> 12:23.400
>> Bill: CLINT EASTWOOD YOU

12:23.466 --> 12:23.700
MENTIONED.

12:23.766 --> 12:26.000
>> THEY ALWAYS BRING UP TURTLE

12:26.066 --> 12:28.466
OR THREE GUYS.

12:28.533 --> 12:32.100
>> Bill: HE MADE GRAN TORINO

12:32.166 --> 12:33.433
WHEN HE WAS 110 AND THAT'S ONE

12:33.500 --> 12:36.300
OF MY FAVORITES.

12:36.366 --> 12:38.900
WE STARTED AROUND THE SAME TIME.

12:38.966 --> 12:39.833
AND OF COURSE I'M AT THE TOP OF

12:39.900 --> 12:43.500
MY GAME.

12:43.566 --> 12:44.366
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

12:44.433 --> 12:47.200
SPEAK OF THE COUNTRY HAS HELPED

12:47.266 --> 12:47.766
YOU, GIVING YOU SHIT TO TALK

12:47.833 --> 12:49.800
ABOUT!

12:49.866 --> 12:50.233
[LAUGHTER]

12:50.300 --> 12:51.000
>> Bill: BUT YOU ACCUMULATE

12:51.066 --> 12:52.800
SKILLS AS YOU GO FORWARD, YOU

12:52.866 --> 12:53.400
GET BETTER.

12:53.466 --> 12:54.266
THAT'S WHY I'M TELLING YOU I

12:54.333 --> 12:56.800
THINK YOUR LAST ONE WAS THE BEST

12:56.866 --> 12:58.266
ONE, WOULD YOU HAVE MADE -- IF

12:58.333 --> 12:59.866
YOU WERE MAKING RESERVOIR DOGS

12:59.933 --> 13:01.833
TOMORROW, WOULD YOU MAKE THE

13:01.900 --> 13:02.333
EXACT SAME MOVIE?

13:02.400 --> 13:03.100
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN MAKE IT

13:03.166 --> 13:06.166
EVEN BETTER?

13:06.233 --> 13:07.766
>> THAT'S KIND OF A CAPTURED

13:07.833 --> 13:11.066
TIME IN A MOMENT KIND OF THING

13:11.133 --> 13:12.300
BUT I ACTUALLY CONSIDERED ABOUT

13:12.366 --> 13:13.566
DOING A REMAKE OF RESERVOIR DOGS

13:13.633 --> 13:17.533
AS MY LAST MOVIE, I WON'T DO IT,

13:17.600 --> 13:20.166
INTERNET, BUT I CONSIDERED IT.

13:20.233 --> 13:21.600
[LAUGHTER]

13:21.666 --> 13:22.200
>> Bill: I UNDERSTAND, YOUR

13:22.266 --> 13:25.133
LIFE HAS CHANGED A LOT, A REAL

13:25.200 --> 13:25.333
LOT.

13:25.400 --> 13:28.433
I STILL THINK OF YOU IS THE GUY

13:28.500 --> 13:29.766
WHO WAS SITTING IN SWINGERS

13:29.833 --> 13:31.800
WRITING A SCREENPLAY IN A BOOTH

13:31.866 --> 13:32.333
BY YOURSELF.

13:32.400 --> 13:35.466
>> I KIND OF STILL THINK OF

13:35.533 --> 13:37.366
MYSELF THAT WAY.

13:37.433 --> 13:38.433
>> Bill: YOU'RE MARRIED, YOU

13:38.500 --> 13:40.733
HAVE A KID AND YOU LIVE IN

13:40.800 --> 13:43.366
ISRAEL.

13:43.433 --> 13:49.400
DID YOU BECOME A JEW?

13:49.466 --> 13:50.333
>> OF COURSE NOT.

13:50.400 --> 13:53.200
>> Bill: DON'T SAY IT LIKE

13:53.266 --> 13:53.533
THAT!"

13:53.600 --> 13:56.000
BEGUN NOT GOING TO BE THAT GUY

13:56.066 --> 13:57.966
WHO GETS MARRIED AND DOES THE

13:58.033 --> 13:58.266
CONVERSION!

13:58.333 --> 13:59.366
>> Bill: IS NOT AN

13:59.433 --> 13:59.933
UNREASONABLE QUESTION WHEN

14:00.000 --> 14:03.033
SOMEONE MOVES TO ISRAEL.

14:03.100 --> 14:06.800
>> MY WIFE DIDN'T BECOME A

14:06.866 --> 14:08.366
CHRISTIAN EITHER BUT I DIDN'T

14:08.433 --> 14:10.533
BECOME A CHRISTIAN, I'M AN

14:10.600 --> 14:11.500
ATHEIST.

14:11.566 --> 14:14.000
I'M GOING TO CONVERT TO ANOTHER

14:14.066 --> 14:16.500
GOD I DON'T BELIEVE IN.

14:16.566 --> 14:17.400
[LAUGHTER]

14:17.466 --> 14:19.433
>> Bill: WHAT'S IT LIKE OVER

14:19.500 --> 14:20.533
THERE?

14:20.600 --> 14:21.433
DO YOU MISS L.A.?

14:21.500 --> 14:26.566
>> OF COURSE I MISS L.A.

14:26.633 --> 14:27.866
TEL AVIV IS VERY SIMILAR TO

14:27.933 --> 14:28.633
LOS ANGELES, THE WEATHER IS

14:28.700 --> 14:31.433
ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME.

14:31.500 --> 14:34.800
>> Bill: IT'S VERY LIBERAL.

14:34.866 --> 14:35.766
>> YOUR SWEATING BALLS HERE,

14:35.833 --> 14:40.700
YOUR SWEATING BALLS THERE.

14:40.766 --> 14:43.200
IT'S LIKE L.A. IF L.A. WAS

14:43.266 --> 14:43.533
REALLY TINY.

14:43.600 --> 14:45.100
LOS ANGELES COUNTY YOU CAN RIDE

14:45.166 --> 14:48.966
AROUND ON A BIKE IN ABOUT FOUR

14:49.033 --> 14:52.366
HOURS, TEL AVIV HAS MAGNIFICENT

14:52.433 --> 14:54.566
RESTAURANTS AND COOL BARS AND

14:54.633 --> 14:57.400
COOL CLUBS, A LOT OF THE STUFF

14:57.466 --> 14:58.600
AT LOS ANGELES I'M NOT EVEN

14:58.666 --> 14:59.100
TALKING ABOUT NEW YORK,

14:59.166 --> 15:02.600
LOS ANGELES IN PARTICULAR, THEY

15:02.666 --> 15:06.066
HAVE A SIMILAR VIBE.

15:06.133 --> 15:07.366
>> Bill: WERE YOU THERE DURING

15:07.433 --> 15:09.633
THE RECENT UNPLEASANTRIES?

15:09.700 --> 15:11.766
>> I WAS THERE FOR THE WHOLE

15:11.833 --> 15:11.966
TIME.

15:12.033 --> 15:13.733
>> Bill: YOU HAD TO GO INTO

15:13.800 --> 15:14.066
BOMB SHELTERS?

15:14.133 --> 15:18.766
WHAT IS THAT LIKE?

15:18.833 --> 15:22.900
>> IT HAPPEN FOR ABOUT A WEEK OR

15:22.966 --> 15:24.000
SO.

15:24.066 --> 15:26.966
IT IS A CITYWIDE SIREN GOING ON

15:27.033 --> 15:31.300
AND THAT'S LETTING YOU KNOW, THE

15:31.366 --> 15:32.733
HAMAS MISSILES ARE ON THEIR WAY

15:32.800 --> 15:35.600
AND YOU GO AND I TAKE MY 15

15:35.666 --> 15:40.333
MONTH SON AND WE WERE LUCKY

15:40.400 --> 15:41.366
ENOUGH TO HAVE A BOMB SHELTER

15:41.433 --> 15:43.466
AND CLOSE THE DOOR.

15:43.533 --> 15:51.366
THEN YOU HEAR THIS BOOM, BOOM,

15:51.433 --> 15:52.766
BOOM-BOOM, BOOM.

15:52.833 --> 15:54.600
THAT'S THE MISSILE BEING BLOWN

15:54.666 --> 15:55.133
OUT OF THE SKY.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.266
>> Bill: WOULD YOU MAKE A

15:56.333 --> 15:56.666
MOVIE ABOUT THAT?

15:56.733 --> 15:59.533
A LOT OF YOUR MOVIES ARE

15:59.600 --> 16:01.100
CENTERED ON THE IDEA OF REVENGE,

16:01.166 --> 16:02.900
ONE OF THE REASON WE LOVE THEM

16:02.966 --> 16:04.100
SO MUCH, YOU HAVE A GREAT WAY OF

16:04.166 --> 16:06.533
PULLING THE ARROW BACK AND WHEN

16:06.600 --> 16:09.400
YOU FIRE IT IT IS JUST SO

16:09.466 --> 16:11.833
SATISFYING.

16:11.900 --> 16:16.733
[APPLAUSE]

16:16.800 --> 16:18.600
THIS IS THE REVENGE CAPITAL OF

16:18.666 --> 16:20.700
THE WORLD!

16:20.766 --> 16:21.866
THAT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BE A

16:21.933 --> 16:23.533
GREAT AREA AND YOU CAN MAKE ONE

16:23.600 --> 16:26.433
OVER THERE, MAKE MOVIES THERE

16:26.500 --> 16:27.100
TOO.

16:27.166 --> 16:29.333
>> I'M VERY AWARE, I WOULDN'T

16:29.400 --> 16:30.900
MAKE A MOVIE ABOUT THE POLITICAL

16:30.966 --> 16:31.666
CLIMATE THERE, I'M NOT CONNECTED

16:31.733 --> 16:33.066
ENOUGH TO IT.

16:33.133 --> 16:37.366
HAVING SAID ALL OF THAT, IF YOU

16:37.433 --> 16:38.900
ACTUALLY SHOOT A MOVIE IN

16:38.966 --> 16:39.766
JERUSALEM, THERE'S NO WAY YOU

16:39.833 --> 16:41.566
CAN PUT THE CAMERA WHERE YOU'RE

16:41.633 --> 16:43.633
NOT CAPTURING SOMETHING

16:43.700 --> 16:44.433
FANTASTIC.

16:44.500 --> 16:45.933
YOU HAVE A ROOFTOP RESTAURANT

16:46.000 --> 16:49.133
SCENE AND YOU JUST SEE THIS SEA

16:49.200 --> 16:50.366
OF DOMES AND MAGNIFICENT

16:50.433 --> 16:51.166
ARCHITECTURE GOING ON FOR MILES

16:51.233 --> 16:54.900
AND MILES AND MILES.

16:54.966 --> 16:55.466
>> Bill: ONE THING BEFORE WE

16:55.533 --> 16:59.133
RUN A TIME I HAVE TO SAY TO YOU,

16:59.200 --> 17:00.900
BESIDES THE GREAT

17:00.966 --> 17:02.566
ENTERTAINMENT -- I HAVE ALWAYS

17:02.633 --> 17:03.733
REALLY APPRECIATED THE WAY YOU

17:03.800 --> 17:07.000
PUSHED BACK WHEN ANYONE TRIED TO

17:07.066 --> 17:08.666
STIFLE YOU, SHUT YOU UP, SHAME

17:08.733 --> 17:14.666
YOU, BULLY YOU, CORRAL YOUR

17:14.733 --> 17:15.500
ARTISTIC LICENSE.

17:15.566 --> 17:18.533
THEY TRIED IT WITH THE LAST ONE

17:18.600 --> 17:19.966
WITH ONCE UPON A TIME IN

17:20.033 --> 17:21.266
HOLLYWOOD, SOME BULLSHIT ABOUT

17:21.333 --> 17:21.866
HOW MARGOT ROBBIE DOESN'T HAVE

17:21.933 --> 17:23.266
ENOUGH LINES AND YOU DO WHAT I

17:23.333 --> 17:25.066
WISH OTHER PEOPLE WOULD DO,

17:25.133 --> 17:25.900
INSTEAD OF APOLOGIZING LIKE A

17:25.966 --> 17:28.833
LITTLE PUSSY, YOU SAY "I DON'T

17:28.900 --> 17:32.533
AGREE WITH YOUR ASSESSMENT."

17:32.600 --> 17:34.700
WHAT'S SO HARD ABOUT THAT?

17:34.766 --> 17:35.166
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

17:35.233 --> 17:36.566
CAN YOU TEACH THAT TO OTHERS?

17:36.633 --> 17:42.666
IT'S YOUR MOVIE.

17:42.733 --> 17:45.300
>> EVEN IN A PRESSURE SITUATION

17:45.366 --> 17:47.300
WHERE IT'S LIKE YOUR MOVIE IS

17:47.366 --> 17:48.133
OPENING NEXT FRIDAY, IT'S KIND

17:48.200 --> 17:52.533
OF A PRESSURE SITUATION,

17:52.600 --> 17:54.966
WHATEVER -- YOU DON'T WANT TO

17:55.033 --> 17:56.700
MAKE NOISE THAT'S NOT THE NOISE

17:56.766 --> 17:57.533
WANT TO MAKE WHEN THE MOVIE

17:57.600 --> 18:01.033
OPENS BUT NEVERTHELESS, IF

18:01.100 --> 18:01.966
SOMEBODY BRINGS UP SOMETHING

18:02.033 --> 18:03.266
THAT ACTUALLY IS LEGITIMATE, I

18:03.333 --> 18:05.466
WILL HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH

18:05.533 --> 18:06.500
THEM ABOUT IT.

18:06.566 --> 18:07.700
I'M INTO INTERESTING THOUGHT AND

18:07.766 --> 18:09.000
I DON'T HAVE TO AGREE WITH

18:09.066 --> 18:12.633
YOU -- THAT'S AN INTERESTING

18:12.700 --> 18:13.933
POINT.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.800
AND I'M ABLE TO TALK ABOUT THAT.

18:15.866 --> 18:20.833
BUT LET'S JUST B.S., WHEN IT'S

18:20.900 --> 18:21.233
JUST BULLSHIT TO.

18:21.300 --> 18:21.933
>> Bill: IT SEEMS LIKE

26:31.500 --> 26:31.633
LOST.

26:31.700 --> 26:33.533
>> BOTH PARTIES HAVE A SABOTAGE

26:33.600 --> 26:34.066
WHEN, DON'T THEY?

26:34.133 --> 26:35.733
>> Bill: NOT WITH LANGUAGE

26:35.800 --> 26:37.133
LIKE THAT, THE REPUBLICANS ARE

26:37.200 --> 26:38.733
THE OPPOSITE THEY ARE GENIUSES

26:38.800 --> 26:39.033
OF LANGUAGE.

26:39.100 --> 26:41.566
WHEN THEY WERE LOSING ON THE

26:41.633 --> 26:42.733
ESTATE TAX THEY CHANGED IT TO

26:42.800 --> 26:45.500
THE DEATH TAX, NOBODY LIKES

26:45.566 --> 26:47.366
DEATH.

26:47.433 --> 26:48.966
SPEAKING OF DEATH, LET'S TALK

26:49.033 --> 26:49.200
PLAGUE.

26:49.266 --> 26:51.833
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU TWO

26:51.900 --> 26:53.900
GUYS, REALLY, BECAUSE YOU ARE

26:53.966 --> 26:56.133
HISTORIANS AND I WAS A HISTORY

26:56.200 --> 26:56.966
MAJOR MYSELF.

26:57.033 --> 27:00.133
I WANT YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THIS,

27:00.200 --> 27:00.900
YOUR BOOK AS A WHOLE CHAPTER ON

27:00.966 --> 27:04.033
PLAGUE, IT'S FANTASTIC.

27:04.100 --> 27:06.233
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE HAVE ANY

27:06.300 --> 27:07.433
PERSPECTIVE ABOUT THE PLAGUE WE

27:07.500 --> 27:11.266
JUST WENT THROUGH, IT WAS A BAD

27:11.333 --> 27:12.566
THING BUT IT KILLED LESS THAN

27:12.633 --> 27:17.200
HALF A PERCENTAGE POINT -- LESS

27:17.266 --> 27:18.533
THAN ONE HALF PERCENTAGE OF THE

27:18.600 --> 27:19.500
POPULATION.

27:19.566 --> 27:20.133
BAD, I'M AGAINST DEATH, I DON'T

27:20.200 --> 27:23.333
CARE WHO KNOWS IT.

27:23.400 --> 27:24.033
[LAUGHTER]

27:24.100 --> 27:26.066
IT'S SAD WHEN ANYONE DIES AND WE

27:26.133 --> 27:27.200
DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO DIE AND

27:27.266 --> 27:28.166
IT'S WORSE WHEN IT'S PEOPLE WE

27:28.233 --> 27:31.766
KNOW OR OURSELVES.

27:31.833 --> 27:32.033
[LAUGHTER]

27:32.100 --> 27:33.933
BUT EARTH IS A TIME-SHARE.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.833
WE CAN'T ALL BE HERE AT THE SAME

27:35.900 --> 27:38.833
TIME, THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT

27:38.900 --> 27:40.033
WORKS.

27:40.100 --> 27:40.733
COMPARED TO THE PLAGUE OF

27:40.800 --> 27:42.766
ATHENS, A QUARTER OF THE

27:42.833 --> 27:44.633
POPULATION, ADULT POPULATION

27:44.700 --> 27:46.900
WHICH WOULD BE 85 MILLION

27:46.966 --> 27:48.066
PEOPLE -- THE PLAGUE OF

27:48.133 --> 27:51.666
JUSTINIAN, YOU ALL REMEMBER

27:51.733 --> 27:54.500
THESE, THAT WAS IN THE SIXTH

27:54.566 --> 27:56.233
CENTURY A.D., ATHENS WAS IN

27:56.300 --> 27:58.766
ANCIENT ATHENS, THAT WAS HALF

27:58.833 --> 27:59.533
THE POPULATION.

27:59.600 --> 28:01.400
THE BLACK DEATH KILLED

28:01.466 --> 28:04.366
TWO-THIRDS OF ENGLAND, RIGHT?

28:04.433 --> 28:06.533
THE POPULATION I DON'T THINK

28:06.600 --> 28:07.700
RECOVERED FOR 300 YEARS.

28:07.766 --> 28:10.333
>> AND KEPT COMING BACK, THAT'S

28:10.400 --> 28:11.100
THE PART PEOPLE FORGET.

28:11.166 --> 28:13.266
YOU GO THROUGH IT, YOU LIVE

28:13.333 --> 28:15.266
THROUGH IT, YOU SURVIVE AND TWO

28:15.333 --> 28:16.766
OR THREE YEARS LATER IT COMES

28:16.833 --> 28:18.633
BACK WITH A VENGEANCE.

28:18.700 --> 28:21.200
>> Bill: IT WAS LIKE PLAGUE OF

28:21.266 --> 28:21.500
PLUS HERPES!

28:21.566 --> 28:23.733
>> IF WE HAD THIS FOUR TIMES THE

28:23.800 --> 28:24.800
NEXT 20 YEARS IMAGINE HOW MUCH

28:24.866 --> 28:25.566
MORE DRAMATIC THAT WOULD THAN

28:25.633 --> 28:28.633
GOING THROUGH IT ONCE.

28:28.700 --> 28:31.033
>> Bill: THE BLACK DEATH

28:31.100 --> 28:33.266
CHANGED EVERYTHING.

28:33.333 --> 28:38.133
BARBARA TUCHMAN SAID IT WAS THE

28:38.200 --> 28:40.633
FATHER OF MODERN MAN BECAUSE IT

28:40.700 --> 28:41.133
CREATED AN IMMENSE LABOR

28:41.200 --> 28:43.933
SHORTAGE FOR THE FIRST TIME.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.033
THE PEASANTS ADD SOME LEVERAGE

28:45.100 --> 28:47.833
IN THE MARKET AND ALSO CHANGED

28:47.900 --> 28:48.266
PEOPLE'S ATTITUDES.

28:48.333 --> 28:49.366
THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE IN THINGS

28:49.433 --> 28:51.433
ANYMORE, THE CHURCH TOOK A BIG

28:51.500 --> 28:53.066
HIT.

28:53.133 --> 28:53.833
THERE WERE ORGIES BECAUSE THEY

28:53.900 --> 28:55.466
WERE JUST LIKE FUCK IT, WE ARE

28:55.533 --> 28:57.966
PROBABLY ALL GOING TO BE DEAD

28:58.033 --> 28:58.566
TOMORROW.

28:58.633 --> 28:59.733
>> IT'S LIKE A "STAR TREK"

28:59.800 --> 29:03.866
EPISODE, RIGHT?

29:03.933 --> 29:06.900
>> Bill: WHAT ABOUT THIS

29:06.966 --> 29:08.300
PLAGUE LIGHT THAT WE HAD, HOW IS

29:08.366 --> 29:11.500
THIS GOING TO PERMANENTLY CHANGE

29:11.566 --> 29:11.733
THINGS?

29:11.800 --> 29:13.766
I THINK THERE'S A PARALLEL WITH

29:13.833 --> 29:15.833
THE PEASANTS IN THE MIDDLE AGES

29:15.900 --> 29:16.500
WHO HAD MORE LEVERAGE.

29:16.566 --> 29:18.766
WE SEE IT RIGHT NOW, NEARLY HALF

29:18.833 --> 29:20.033
OF ALL SMALL BUSINESSES CAN'T

29:20.100 --> 29:22.833
FIND ENOUGH WORKERS.

29:22.900 --> 29:24.033
THE FIRST TIME, WORKERS HAVE

29:24.100 --> 29:25.233
SOME LEVERAGE, NOT BECAUSE

29:25.300 --> 29:26.466
PEOPLE DIED SO MUCH, BECAUSE

29:26.533 --> 29:28.400
THEY GOT MONEY FROM THE

29:28.466 --> 29:29.600
GOVERNMENT.

29:29.666 --> 29:32.733
>> I THINK IT'S WRONG TO ASSUME

29:32.800 --> 29:34.533
THE ENTIRE POPULATION WILL GO IN

29:34.600 --> 29:35.800
ONE DIRECTION.

29:35.866 --> 29:38.100
WE ARE SO DIVIDED, PEOPLE WILL

29:38.166 --> 29:39.766
RESPOND TO A POST PLAGUE AMERICA

29:39.833 --> 29:40.066
DIFFERENTLY.

29:40.133 --> 29:41.033
AS A PORTION IT'S GOING TO STAY

29:41.100 --> 29:41.900
IN THE CAVE NO MATTER WHAT YOU

29:41.966 --> 29:43.766
TELL THEM, THERE'S GOING TO BE A

29:43.833 --> 29:45.233
FORTUNE LIKE ME THAT IS SLOWLY

29:45.300 --> 29:47.133
AND CAUTIOUSLY COMING OUT AND

29:47.200 --> 29:48.000
READY TO RUN RIGHT BACK IN WHEN

29:48.066 --> 29:51.400
THINGS GET BAD AND THERE'S

29:51.466 --> 29:52.333
ANOTHER PORTION IT'S GOING TO

29:52.400 --> 29:57.066
MAKE SURE THE NEXT PANDEMIC IS

29:57.133 --> 30:00.466
SYPHILIS.

30:00.533 --> 30:00.733
[LAUGHTER]

30:00.800 --> 30:03.366
>> I TEND TO BE A BIT OF A

30:03.433 --> 30:04.133
DEVIL'S ADVOCATE, IF WE HAVE TO

30:04.200 --> 30:05.766
DO THIS AGAIN IN A COUPLE YEARS

30:05.833 --> 30:07.566
THERE'S A CHANCE THAT WE KNOW

30:07.633 --> 30:10.233
BETTER WHAT TO DO.

30:10.300 --> 30:13.100
BILL GATES WAS TALKING ABOUT

30:13.166 --> 30:14.133
VARIANCE AND THINGS HITTING US

30:14.200 --> 30:15.633
IN THE FUTURE, I HAVE A FEELING

30:15.700 --> 30:17.333
IS NOT GOING TO SEEM SO WEIRD IF

30:17.400 --> 30:18.766
WE HAVE TO PUT ON MASKS AGAIN.

30:18.833 --> 30:19.766
I DON'T KNOW THAT WE ARE NOT

30:19.833 --> 30:21.766
GOING TO BE TRAUMATIZED BUT

30:21.833 --> 30:22.966
MAYBE HARDENED US A LITTLE BIT

30:23.033 --> 30:25.500
AND GIVEN US A TASTE OF WHAT

30:25.566 --> 30:26.400
HUMAN LIFE THROUGHOUT MOST OF

30:26.466 --> 30:27.800
THE ERRORS AND IN THE LARGE PART

30:27.866 --> 30:30.900
OF AN UNDEVELOPED WORLD IS LIKE.

30:30.966 --> 30:31.666
PANDEMICS AND DISEASE ARE A

30:31.733 --> 30:34.066
REALITY THAT WE BEEN ABLE TO

30:34.133 --> 30:36.100
AVOID.

30:36.166 --> 30:36.833
[APPLAUSE]

30:36.900 --> 30:38.133
>> Bill: IT'S ONLY VERY

30:38.200 --> 30:38.966
RECENTLY THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

30:39.033 --> 30:40.933
ABLE TO FEEL AS SAFE AS WE DO.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.733
>> THE PANDEMIC OF 1918-1919 WAS

30:44.800 --> 30:46.266
A DISASTER, THE SPANISH FLU.

30:46.333 --> 30:48.300
>> Bill: THAT KILLED ABOUT

30:48.366 --> 30:49.366
5% -- WE ARE GENERALLY LIVING IN

30:49.433 --> 30:55.300
GOOD TIMES BUT --

30:55.366 --> 30:57.000
>> IT HIT US AT THE WORST TIME

30:57.066 --> 31:00.200
BECAUSE WE'VE ALSO LOST SO MUCH

31:00.266 --> 31:01.833
LIVING MEMORY OF PREVACCINE

31:01.900 --> 31:02.533
AMERICA.

31:02.600 --> 31:03.900
THE LAST GENERATION THAT GREW UP

31:03.966 --> 31:06.366
BEFORE VACCINES, THEY ARE MOSTLY

31:06.433 --> 31:07.466
GONE.

31:07.533 --> 31:08.833
THERE ISN'T A GOT FEAR OF

31:08.900 --> 31:10.666
MICROBES THE WAY THERE USED TO

31:10.733 --> 31:10.833
BE.

31:10.900 --> 31:12.333
20 YEARS AGO IF YOU WOULD'VE

31:12.400 --> 31:14.833
TOLD YOUR GRANDPARENTS YOU'RE

31:14.900 --> 31:15.500
NOT GOING TO VACCINATE YOUR KID

31:15.566 --> 31:17.000
THEY WOULD SMACK YOU IN THE BACK

31:17.066 --> 31:17.933
OF THE HEAD BECAUSE THEY KNOW

31:18.000 --> 31:19.300
WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO GROW UP

31:19.366 --> 31:20.500
WITHOUT POLIO AND THE ONLY

31:20.566 --> 31:21.666
MEDICAL INSURANCE WAS A BIG

31:21.733 --> 31:24.433
FAMILY AND THAT WAS IT.

31:24.500 --> 31:25.866
NOW WE TAKE THIS ALL FOR GRANTED

31:25.933 --> 31:27.700
AND MAYBE IT WILL BRING RESPECT

31:27.766 --> 31:32.366
BACK TO THE INVISIBLE ENEMY.

31:32.433 --> 31:34.900
[APPLAUSE]

31:34.966 --> 31:36.333
>> Bill: WHAT ABOUT THE FACT

31:36.400 --> 31:37.000
THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T WANT

31:37.066 --> 31:39.633
TO LEAVE HOME NOW?

31:39.700 --> 31:42.266
I THINK THEY PROBABLY DIDN'T

31:42.333 --> 31:43.466
BEFORE -- IT TURNS OUT THEY

31:43.533 --> 31:47.100
DON'T REALLY LIKE THE OFFICE.

31:47.166 --> 31:50.233
44% ARE WILLING TO TAKE A 10%

31:50.300 --> 31:50.900
PAY CUT TO NEVER HAVE TO GO BACK

31:50.966 --> 31:53.533
TO THE OFFICE.

31:53.600 --> 31:54.966
THEY REALLY DIDN'T LIKE THE

31:55.033 --> 31:57.466
BREAK ROOM.

31:57.533 --> 31:58.666
[LAUGHTER]

31:58.733 --> 32:00.300
>> OR THE COMMUTE TO.

32:00.366 --> 32:01.266
>> Bill: IT NEVER CROSSED

32:01.333 --> 32:03.666
THEIR MIND THEY COULD GET AWAY

32:03.733 --> 32:04.900
WITH NOT GOING.

32:04.966 --> 32:06.500
NOW, OF COURSE, THAT HAS BECOME

32:06.566 --> 32:07.300
THE NORM AND THEY DON'T WANT TO

32:07.366 --> 32:09.466
GO BACK.

32:09.533 --> 32:11.200
SOME OF THAT IS GOOD, WE'LL AND

32:11.266 --> 32:14.600
SAVE ON POLLUTING THE AIR, LESS

32:14.666 --> 32:16.266
COMMUTE, I DON'T KNOW IF IT

32:16.333 --> 32:17.733
ISOLATES US, I DON'T KNOW IF IT

32:17.800 --> 32:19.133
WILL BE TERRIBLE -- I HAPPEN TO

32:19.200 --> 32:21.100
LIKE COMING TO A COMMUNAL PLACE.

32:21.166 --> 32:22.733
I DON'T HAVE A FAMILY, THIS IS

32:22.800 --> 32:28.533
MY FAMILY.

32:28.600 --> 32:31.266
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

32:31.333 --> 32:33.366
>> IF I NEVER DO ANOTHER ZOOM

32:33.433 --> 32:35.500
CALL IT WILL BE TOO SOON.

32:35.566 --> 32:38.566
>> AND JUST FUCKING WITH YOU.

32:38.633 --> 32:41.666
THEY REALLY ARE -- AND WE ARE

32:41.733 --> 32:43.033
GOING TO COME BACK TO THE OFFICE

32:43.100 --> 32:43.966
AND I'M ALL FOR THAT, I THINK

32:44.033 --> 32:47.300
THAT IS TERRIFIC.

32:47.366 --> 32:48.833
NOT EVERYBODY LIKES IT THAT WAY

32:48.900 --> 32:50.866
AND WITH NOT HAVING TO COMMUTE,

32:50.933 --> 32:53.366
PEOPLE CAN LIVE IN DIFFERENT

32:53.433 --> 32:54.466
PLACES.

32:54.533 --> 32:56.100
THE CITIES ARE GOING TO BE

32:56.166 --> 32:57.300
PROBABLY NOT EMPTY NOW BUT

32:57.366 --> 32:58.933
PEOPLE CAN MOVE FAR AWAY, THEY

32:59.000 --> 33:01.133
DON'T HAVE TO LIVE IN THE CITY

33:01.200 --> 33:01.800
CENTER ANYMORE OR ANYWHERE, YOU

33:01.866 --> 33:02.900
CAN LIVE IN THE MIDDLE OF

33:02.966 --> 33:07.600
NOWHERE AS LONG AS YOU HAVE ZOO

33:07.666 --> 33:08.433
ZOOM.

33:08.500 --> 33:09.300
>> THE TECHNOLOGY HAS MADE IT

33:09.366 --> 33:10.000
POSSIBLE, YOU COULDN'T DO THIS

33:10.066 --> 33:13.233
IN THE 70s.

33:13.300 --> 33:14.500
>> Bill: ONE LAST THING ABOUT

33:14.566 --> 33:17.600
THE PLAGUE, IT TOOK A LOT OF

33:17.666 --> 33:19.233
BELIEF PEOPLE HAD IN THE

33:19.300 --> 33:20.233
CATHOLIC CHURCH AWAY BECAUSE THE

33:20.300 --> 33:22.066
CHURCH WAS THERE TO PROTECT YOU

33:22.133 --> 33:24.233
AND PEOPLE SAW NOTHING COULD

33:24.300 --> 33:26.066
PROTECT YOU.

33:26.133 --> 33:29.166
THIS IS PROBABLY -- ONE REASON

33:29.233 --> 33:31.333
WHY THE PROTESTANT REFORMATION

33:31.400 --> 33:32.533
STARTED, THIS IS WHAT BARBARA

33:32.600 --> 33:33.466
TUCHMAN MEANT BY THE BEGINNING

33:33.533 --> 33:34.933
OF MODERN MAN.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.966
I NOTICED OUR CHURCH, THIS WEEK

33:38.033 --> 33:40.133
THEY SAID THEY'RE GOING TO DENY

33:40.200 --> 33:43.633
BIDEN COMMUNION.

33:43.700 --> 33:45.266
THE AMERICAN CHURCHES GOING IN A

33:45.333 --> 33:46.700
COMPLETELY OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF

33:46.766 --> 33:49.100
THE VATICAN ITSELF, THE AMERICAN

33:49.166 --> 33:53.466
CHURCH IS LIKE MEL GIBSON'S DAD

33:53.533 --> 33:54.766
TERRITORY.

33:54.833 --> 33:57.233
IN THE VATICAN IS MUCH MORE

33:57.300 --> 33:58.666
MODERN AND THE COURT IS NOT

33:58.733 --> 34:00.866
GOING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS

34:00.933 --> 34:02.966
THE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY.

34:03.033 --> 34:05.066
THEY VOTED AGAINST GAY PARENTS,

34:05.133 --> 34:06.333
CAN'T ADOPT.

34:06.400 --> 34:07.000
THIS IS THE RECENT COURT WE HAVE

34:07.066 --> 34:08.966
NOW WITH SIX AND HAVE CATHOLICS

34:09.033 --> 34:10.533
ON IT, COVID RESTRICTIONS ON

34:10.600 --> 34:11.566
CHURCHES THEY WOULD NOT PUT THAT

34:11.633 --> 34:13.900
INTO EFFECT.

34:13.966 --> 34:16.733
EMPLOYERS CAN DENY CONTRACEPTIO

34:16.800 --> 34:17.333
CONTRACEPTION, THE COUNTRY IS

34:17.400 --> 34:20.366
GETTING MUCH MORE ATHEIST, MUCH

34:20.433 --> 34:21.500
MORE ANTIRELIGIOUS AND THE COURT

34:21.566 --> 34:23.033
IS GETTING MORE RELIGIOUS SPIRIT

34:23.100 --> 34:24.000
OF WHAT IS THE UPSHOT OF THIS

WE ACTUALLY DO GET IT AND

PREDICT IT AND IT HAPPENS, LOOK

AS I MENTIONED IN THE MONOLOGUE

37:21.966 --> 37:23.100
WE FOUND OUT THIS WEEK THAT HE

37:23.166 --> 37:26.100
ACTUALLY WAS VERY, VERY SICK AND

37:26.166 --> 37:28.066
I READ ALL THE THINGS THEY GAVE

37:28.133 --> 37:28.800
HIM, I REMEMBER THIS AT THE

37:28.866 --> 37:31.566
TIME -- THERE WERE THREE MAJOR

37:31.633 --> 37:33.000
THINGS.

37:33.066 --> 37:33.300
WHAT IS IT?

37:33.366 --> 37:37.500
YOU WOULD NO, ANTI- -- SOMETHING

37:37.566 --> 37:38.500
HEAVY.

37:38.566 --> 37:42.733
AND THEN REMDESIVIR, THAT ONE

37:42.800 --> 37:43.500
AND SOMETHING ELSE BECAUSE IT

37:43.566 --> 37:44.800
MADE ME THINK BECAUSE HE WAS NOT

37:44.866 --> 37:48.233
A HEALTHY MAN, HE'S NOT NOW.

37:48.300 --> 37:51.933
HE'S OVERWEIGHT, HE PAID NO

37:52.000 --> 37:53.033
CONCESSIONS TO HEALTH.

37:53.100 --> 37:57.133
HE EATS STEAK WITH KETCHUP ON I

37:57.200 --> 37:59.233
IT.

37:59.300 --> 38:01.566
IT JUST SAYS TO ME THAT THEY DO

38:01.633 --> 38:05.266
KNOW HOW TO CURE THIS.

38:05.333 --> 38:06.466
IF THEY THREW THE FUCKING

38:06.533 --> 38:07.466
KITCHEN SINK AT IT, THEY CAN

38:07.533 --> 38:10.733
EVEN SAVE HIM AND THEY DID.

38:10.800 --> 38:12.166
IT'S REALLY JUST A MATTER OF OUR

38:12.233 --> 38:18.233
WILL AND I GUESS MONEY.

38:18.300 --> 38:19.666
IF THEY HAVE THESE DRUGS, I

38:19.733 --> 38:20.333
DON'T KNOW WHY THEY COULDN'T GET

38:20.400 --> 38:22.800
THEM IN ANYBODY BUT WHAT I

38:22.866 --> 38:23.866
REALLY WANT TO ASK OF IT IS THE

38:23.933 --> 38:26.266
LAB LEAK THEORY.

38:26.333 --> 38:28.133
YOU GUYS WOULD BE GREAT TO ASK

38:28.200 --> 38:29.400
ABOUT THIS, I WOULD BE SAYING

38:29.466 --> 38:31.766
AND I WANT TO REITERATE, THIS

38:31.833 --> 38:33.266
SHOULD NEVER HAVE A POLITICAL

38:33.333 --> 38:34.233
DIMENSION HOW THIS DISEASE

38:34.300 --> 38:34.766
STARTED, THERE IS NOTHING

38:34.833 --> 38:38.000
POLITICAL ABOUT IT, NOTHING.

38:38.066 --> 38:41.866
WHETHER IT CAME FROM SOMEBODY

38:41.933 --> 38:43.366
EATING A BAT OR WHETHER IT CAME

38:43.433 --> 38:45.766
FROM A LAB STUDYING BATS, NOT A

38:45.833 --> 38:46.366
NEFARIOUS PLOT, IT'S HARD TO

38:46.433 --> 38:48.966
KEEP THINGS IN A LAB.

38:49.033 --> 38:51.800
WHERE ARE YOU ON THIS?

38:51.866 --> 38:53.000
>> WE WILL NEVER KNOW WHERE IT

38:53.066 --> 38:54.166
CAME FROM IN CHINA BECAUSE WE

38:54.233 --> 38:55.066
WILL NEVER GET ANSWERS FROM THEM

38:55.133 --> 38:57.433
AND THEY WILL GET AWAY WITH IT

38:57.500 --> 38:59.433
AND IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN BECAUSE

38:59.500 --> 39:03.100
IT IS INDICATIVE OF OUR TOXIC

39:03.166 --> 39:07.133
WHORING RELATIONSHIP WITH

39:07.200 --> 39:08.033
PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.

39:08.100 --> 39:09.500
>> Bill: WHORING BECAUSE.

39:09.566 --> 39:10.966
>> WE INITIALLY INVESTED IN THEM

39:11.033 --> 39:11.966
THINKING OUR MONEY WOULD MAKE

39:12.033 --> 39:13.533
THEM MORE LIKE US IN THE TRAGEDY

39:13.600 --> 39:16.000
IS THE REVERSE HAPPENED.

39:16.066 --> 39:17.533
THERE MONEY HAS MADE US MORE

39:17.600 --> 39:18.400
LIKE THEM.

39:18.466 --> 39:20.500
WE NOW KOWTOW TO THEM, WE

39:20.566 --> 39:22.266
APOLOGIZE FOR THEM AND TO

39:22.333 --> 39:25.300
THEM -- DID YOU SEE JOHN CENA'S

39:25.366 --> 39:26.033
APOLOGY?

39:26.100 --> 39:28.000
THE BIGGEST, TOUGHEST GUY IN THE

39:28.066 --> 39:30.333
WORLD WHO COULD KILL US ALL WITH

39:30.400 --> 39:33.633
HIS THUMB HAD THE MOST

39:33.700 --> 39:35.200
GROVELING, HEARTBREAKING APOLOGY

39:35.266 --> 39:35.500
FOR WHAT TO?

39:35.566 --> 39:38.666
FOR CALLING TAIWAN A COUNTRY.

39:38.733 --> 39:40.966
THAT WAS AT, INSTEAD OF A REBEL

39:41.033 --> 39:42.600
PROVINCE THAT ONE DAY THE PRC

39:42.666 --> 39:44.833
HOPES TO CRUSH AND ABSORB.

39:44.900 --> 39:46.633
>> Bill: CHINA DOES BAD

39:46.700 --> 39:48.800
THINGS, THEY JUST CLOSE THE

39:48.866 --> 39:50.600
NEWSPAPER, THE LAST STANDING

39:50.666 --> 39:51.200
NEWSPAPER IN HONG KONG.

39:51.266 --> 39:54.600
I REMEMBER ONE HONG KONG --

39:54.666 --> 39:57.633
HONG KONG IS GOING TO BE ITS OWN

39:57.700 --> 39:58.900
ENCLAVE, WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE

39:58.966 --> 39:59.966
INTERFERE AND OTHERS PRETTY MUCH

40:00.033 --> 40:01.800
NO DEMOCRACY IN HONG KONG.

40:01.866 --> 40:04.500
JUST LIKE WHAT THEY DO WITH THE

40:04.566 --> 40:05.600
UIGHURS, GATHERING UP THIS

40:05.666 --> 40:06.800
MINORITY AND PUTTING THEM IN

40:06.866 --> 40:07.800
CAMPS.

40:07.866 --> 40:08.366
LIBERALS DON'T WANT TO SAY

40:08.433 --> 40:09.166
ANYTHING BECAUSE THEY ARE ASIAN

40:09.233 --> 40:11.366
AND THEY DON'T THINK VERY

40:11.433 --> 40:13.200
CLEARLY ABOUT THIS, THEY

40:13.266 --> 40:14.533
CONFLATE IT WITH ANTI-ASIAN

40:14.600 --> 40:15.500
HATE CRIMES, IT HAS NOTHING TO

40:15.566 --> 40:17.500
DO -- ONE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

40:17.566 --> 40:17.766
THE OTHER.

40:17.833 --> 40:19.366
>> I DON'T WANT TO DEFEND CHINA

40:19.433 --> 40:20.900
HERE BUT I COULD THINK ABOUT 20

40:20.966 --> 40:23.233
COUNTRIES AND MAY BE US UNDER

40:23.300 --> 40:23.800
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEADERSHIP

40:23.866 --> 40:24.733
ALSO THAT WOULD'VE BEEN VERY

40:24.800 --> 40:28.466
CAREFUL OR EVEN OBVIOUS GATE

40:28.533 --> 40:30.266
WHERE THINGS CAME FROM, DISEASE

40:30.333 --> 40:30.500
WISE.

40:30.566 --> 40:31.666
YOU THINK THE RUSSIANS ARE GOING

40:31.733 --> 40:34.400
TO SAY "IT CAME FROM HERE,

40:34.466 --> 40:34.633
SORRY."

40:34.700 --> 40:39.933
THERE'S LIABILITIES.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.333
>> Bill: THERE WAS A LEAK OF

40:42.400 --> 40:44.833
ANTHRAX.

40:44.900 --> 40:46.700
[APPLAUSE]

40:46.766 --> 40:48.533
1979, THEY COVERED IT UP FOR

40:48.600 --> 40:49.700
YEARS THEY ADMITTED IN THE

40:49.766 --> 40:51.566
90s, THERE WAS A LEAK OF

40:51.633 --> 40:52.266
ANTHRAX.

40:52.333 --> 40:53.533
A COMMUNIST COUNTRY THAT IS

40:53.600 --> 40:55.666
DENYING A LEAK FROM A LAB, IT

40:55.733 --> 40:56.866
HAS HAPPENED BEFORE.

40:56.933 --> 40:58.633
>> THE SOVIETS MADE THE

40:58.700 --> 40:59.433
UNPARDONABLE MISTAKE OF NOT

40:59.500 --> 41:03.633
MAKING CHEAP CRAP THAT WE

41:03.700 --> 41:03.866
NEEDED.

41:03.933 --> 41:04.133
[LAUGHTER]

41:04.200 --> 41:06.466
IF THEY DID, WE WOULD HAVE

41:06.533 --> 41:07.800
FORGIVEN CHERNOBYL.

41:07.866 --> 41:09.766
IF SOMEHOW OUR CRAP WAS MADE

41:09.833 --> 41:10.500
THERE BY THEIR SLAVE LABOR, WE

41:10.566 --> 41:13.866
WOULD HAVE SAID CHERNOBYL, WHAT,

41:13.933 --> 41:14.400
I NEED MY SNEAKERS, THAT

41:14.466 --> 41:16.566
WOULD'VE BEEN IT.

41:16.633 --> 41:18.733
>> HOW DO YOU KNOW IF THE

41:18.800 --> 41:19.600
RUSSIANS DON'T TELL YOU, THE

41:19.666 --> 41:20.866
SOVIETS DON'T TELL YOU COME IT

41:20.933 --> 41:23.033
DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU OWE

41:23.100 --> 41:24.300
THEM, YOU DON'T KNOW.

41:24.366 --> 41:26.100
>> THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

41:26.166 --> 41:27.133
WE THOUGHT WE WERE ATTACHING

41:27.200 --> 41:29.800
HUMAN RIGHTS TO COMMERCE BUT THE

41:29.866 --> 41:31.066
CHINESE HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE

41:31.133 --> 41:31.933
MODEL WHICH IS COMMERCE WITHOUT

41:32.000 --> 41:33.833
HUMAN RIGHTS AND WE ARE GIVING

41:33.900 --> 41:36.466
THAT TO THEM.

41:36.533 --> 41:38.666
WAIT UNTIL DISNEY MAKES THE NEXT

41:38.733 --> 41:44.466
MOVIE WHERE MULAN FIGHTS THE

41:44.533 --> 41:44.766
DALAI LAMA.

41:44.833 --> 41:46.700
>> UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES DO

41:46.766 --> 41:48.000
YOU THINK THEY WOULD'VE RELEASED

41:48.066 --> 41:48.733
THIS INFORMATION?

41:48.800 --> 41:50.900
>> IT WOULD'VE BEEN VERY SIMPLE,

41:50.966 --> 41:52.666
WE HAVE LEGISLATION OVER OUR OWN

41:52.733 --> 41:53.800
CORPORATIONS WHERE WE SAY YOU

41:53.866 --> 41:56.633
ARE AN AMERICAN, YOU WILL NOT

41:56.700 --> 41:57.600
BUILD YOUR FACTORIES IN A

41:57.666 --> 42:00.333
COUNTRY THAT WILL NOT RELEASE

42:00.400 --> 42:04.500
DATA ON VIRUSES THAT WILL KILL

42:04.566 --> 42:05.066
AMERICANS.

42:05.133 --> 42:06.400
THERE WAS A WONDERFUL MOVIE,

42:06.466 --> 42:07.766
TARANTINO I'M SURE HASN'T SEEN

42:07.833 --> 42:09.466
IT THAT WAS CALLED "DESTINATION

42:09.533 --> 42:11.300
TOKYO."

42:11.366 --> 42:13.000
IT WAS A WORLD WAR II MOVIE, A

42:13.066 --> 42:13.866
BOMB AND IT'S AN AMERICAN SUB IT

42:13.933 --> 42:18.466
DOESN'T GO OFF AND THEY PULL THE

42:18.533 --> 42:19.900
BOMB OFF AND IT'S IS MADE OF

42:19.966 --> 42:21.000
AMERICA BECAUSE WE WERE SELLING

42:21.066 --> 42:22.700
SCRAP IRON AND OIL TO THE

42:22.766 --> 42:23.766
JAPANESE BEFORE AND IT CAME BACK

42:23.833 --> 42:26.566
AS WEAPONS TO KILL US.

42:26.633 --> 42:31.900
[APPLAUSE]

42:31.966 --> 42:33.533
>> Bill: TO GO BACK TO PLAGUE

42:33.600 --> 42:35.133
FOR JUST A SECOND, THEY HAVE

42:35.200 --> 42:38.433
SMALLPOX IN RUSSIA AND HERE.

42:38.500 --> 42:40.066
EACH COUNTRY KEEPS A SMALL

42:40.133 --> 42:42.866
AMOUNT ALIVE, WE COULD WIPE OUT

42:42.933 --> 42:44.066
SMALLPOX FOREVER, SMALLPOX IS

42:44.133 --> 42:45.600
ONE OF THE BAD ONES BAD ONES.

42:45.666 --> 42:47.600
>> THEY FOUND THE VIRUS BY THE

42:47.666 --> 42:50.066
WAY, THEY FOUND VIALS THEY

42:50.133 --> 42:51.100
DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE.

42:51.166 --> 42:53.033
>> Bill: WE DO THIS I ASSUME

42:53.100 --> 42:54.333
BECAUSE WE DON'T TRUST EACH

42:54.400 --> 42:54.666
OTHER.

42:54.733 --> 42:56.100
>> WE MIGHT NEED IT TO.

42:56.166 --> 42:57.800
>> Bill: THEY ARE LIKE GERMAN

42:57.866 --> 42:58.000
NUKES.

42:58.066 --> 43:00.033
>> IT'S MUCH LESS THAN WE USE TO

43:00.100 --> 43:02.666
BECOME A LEASE TO HAVE IN THE

43:02.733 --> 43:03.533
COLD WAR MASSIVE BIOLOGICAL

43:03.600 --> 43:04.700
WEAPONS FACTORIES AND STOCKPILES

43:04.766 --> 43:06.000
AND WE TALKED ABOUT HOW THE

43:06.066 --> 43:07.166
SCIENTISTS HELP GET US TO THE

43:07.233 --> 43:09.066
MOON, WE ACTUALLY DID THAT WITH

43:09.133 --> 43:09.833
THE JAPANESE.

43:09.900 --> 43:11.300
THEY HAD A HUGE BIOLOGICAL

43:11.366 --> 43:12.100
WEAPONS PROGRAM AND WE DON'T

43:12.166 --> 43:14.400
KNOW HOW MANY CHINESE THEY

43:14.466 --> 43:15.200
KILLED.

43:15.266 --> 43:17.033
>> UNIT 731.

43:17.100 --> 43:17.800
>> YES.

43:17.866 --> 43:19.233
AFTER THAT, WE TOOK THEIR

43:19.300 --> 43:20.966
SCIENTISTS HERE TO HELP US

43:21.033 --> 43:22.600
DESIGN OUR BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS

43:22.666 --> 43:24.666
AND AFTER THE COLD WAR ENDED WE

43:24.733 --> 43:25.500
HAVE REDUCED THE STOCKPILE BUT

43:25.566 --> 43:27.300
WE STILL NEED TO KNOW HOW IT

43:27.366 --> 43:28.233
OPERATES.

43:28.300 --> 43:29.266
WE CANNOT START FROM SCRATCH IF

43:29.333 --> 43:30.300
GOD FORBID WE GET HIT WITH A

43:30.366 --> 43:32.366
BIOLOGICAL WEAPON.

43:32.433 --> 43:33.500
>> Bill: LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT

43:33.566 --> 43:34.866
THE MEDIA ASPECT OF THIS BECAUSE

43:34.933 --> 43:36.566
I FIND IT OUTRAGEOUS.

43:36.633 --> 43:40.266
THIS BOOK BANNED ANY POST FOR

43:40.333 --> 43:43.033
FOUR MONTHS ABOUT COVID COMING

43:43.100 --> 43:44.166
FROM A LAB.

43:44.233 --> 43:45.300
OF COURSE NOW EVEN THE BIDEN

43:45.366 --> 43:47.233
ADMINISTRATION IS LOOKING INTO

43:47.300 --> 43:49.400
THIS.

43:49.466 --> 43:50.366
GOOGLE, A "WALL STREET JOURNAL"

43:50.433 --> 43:51.166
REPORTER ASKED THE HEAD OF

43:51.233 --> 43:53.266
GOOGLE'S HEALTH DIVISION NOTICED

43:53.333 --> 43:56.366
THEY DON'T DO AUTO FILL SEARCHES

43:56.433 --> 43:57.200
FOR CORONAVIRUS LAB LEAK ON THE

43:57.266 --> 43:59.300
WAY THEY DO IT FOR ANY OTHER

43:59.366 --> 44:00.833
QUESTION AND THE GUY SAID "WE

44:00.900 --> 44:02.600
WANT TO MAKE SURE THE SEARCH

44:02.666 --> 44:04.233
ISN'T LEADING PEOPLE DOWN

44:04.300 --> 44:06.533
PATHWAYS THAT WE WOULD FIND TO

44:06.600 --> 44:06.966
BE NOT AUTHORITATIVE

44:07.033 --> 44:10.233
INFORMATION."

44:10.300 --> 44:11.533
WILL YOU WERE WRONG GOOGLE AND

44:11.600 --> 44:14.033
FACEBOOK, WE DON'T KNOW.

44:14.100 --> 44:15.300
THE REASON WHY WE WANT YOU IS

44:15.366 --> 44:17.866
BECAUSE WE ARE CHECKING ON THIS

44:17.933 --> 44:18.266
SHIT.

44:18.333 --> 44:20.366
WE WANT TO ENSURE THE FIRST

44:20.433 --> 44:21.466
THING USERS SEE IS INFORMATION

44:21.533 --> 44:23.266
FROM THE CDC, THE W.H.O., THAT'S

44:23.333 --> 44:25.833
ONE CHECKING ON!

44:25.900 --> 44:27.033
THE W.H.O. HAS BEEN VERY CORRUPT

44:27.100 --> 44:28.566
ABOUT A LOT OF SHIT IN THE CDC

44:28.633 --> 44:30.666
HAS BEEN WRONG ABOUT A LOT OF

44:30.733 --> 44:31.233
SHIT.

44:31.300 --> 44:32.900
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS THAT I CAN'T

44:32.966 --> 44:33.666
LOOK THIS INFORMATION UP AND NOW

44:33.733 --> 44:38.033
THEY ARE DOING IT WITH THIS DRU

44:38.100 --> 44:40.466
DRUG, THEY THREW BRETT WEINSTEIN

44:40.533 --> 44:41.566
OFF YOUTUBE, YOUTUBE SHOULD NOT

44:41.633 --> 44:45.900
BE TELLING ME WHAT I CAN SEE, IT

44:45.966 --> 44:50.766
ISN'T A RES REGISTERED REPUBLIC,

44:50.833 --> 44:51.133
IT'S A DRUG.

44:51.200 --> 44:52.700
I DON'T KNOW IF IT WORKS OR NOT

44:52.766 --> 44:55.266
AND A LOT OF OTHER DOCTORS DON'T

44:55.333 --> 44:56.166
EITHER.

44:56.233 --> 44:57.233
SPEAK OF THIS DOVETAILS INTO THE

44:57.300 --> 45:00.400
MONOPOLY, IF HE DIDN'T HAVE SUCH

45:00.466 --> 45:01.600
CONTROL OVER SEARCHES FOR

45:01.666 --> 45:02.466
EXAMPLE THIS WOULDN'T BE AS MUCH

45:02.533 --> 45:03.466
OF AN ISSUE.

45:03.533 --> 45:04.966
IF HE DIDN'T GO TO GOOGLE YOU

45:05.033 --> 45:05.966
COULD GO SOMEWHERE ELSE AND YOU

45:06.033 --> 45:07.666
CAN GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.

45:07.733 --> 45:11.066
WHEN YOU HAVE 90% OF GOOGLE

45:11.133 --> 45:12.866
SEARCHES -- THIS IS A FUNCTION

45:12.933 --> 45:13.633
OF THE MONOPOLY.

45:13.700 --> 45:14.933
>> Bill: WHEN IT BECOMES THE

45:15.000 --> 45:17.500
WORD FOR DOING IF YOU HAVE A

45:17.566 --> 45:18.166
MONOPOLY.

45:18.233 --> 45:24.000
PEOPLE DON'T SAY "I'M GOING TO

45:24.066 --> 45:24.366
BING SOMETHING."

45:24.433 --> 45:28.033
>> IT'S LIKE YOU HAVE ONLY ONE

45:28.100 --> 45:28.633
NEWSPAPER, IT'S A FUNCTION OF

45:28.700 --> 45:30.800
THE MONOPOLY.

45:30.866 --> 45:31.766
>> Bill: WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF

45:31.833 --> 45:34.166
TIME BUT I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT

45:34.233 --> 45:34.966
CYBER HACKING, I KNOW THAT'S A

45:35.033 --> 45:36.833
BIG THING WITH YOU.

45:36.900 --> 45:39.333
>> THIS GOES TO SOMETHING MUCH

45:39.400 --> 45:41.200
DEEPER AND IT AFFECTS ALL OF OUR

45:41.266 --> 45:42.033
LIVES AND IT STARTED WITH ONE

45:42.100 --> 45:43.766
HISTORICAL MOMENT.

45:43.833 --> 45:45.533
DAN IS GOING TO DO A 72 HOUR

PODCAST ABOUT IT AND I'M GOING

45:47.600 --> 45:49.400

45:49.466 --> 45:49.866
ONE.

45:49.933 --> 45:51.266
1991 WE FOUGHT A WAR CALLED

45:51.333 --> 45:52.466
DESERT STORM AND IT WAS ABOUT TO

45:52.533 --> 45:54.933
WAIT AND OIL BUT IT WAS ALSO

45:55.000 --> 45:55.433
ABOUT DETERRING FUTURE

45:55.500 --> 45:57.366
AGGRESSION WITH MASSIVE

45:57.433 --> 45:58.000
OVERWHELMING FORCE WHICH IS WHY

45:58.066 --> 46:01.400
WE PUT IT ON 24-HOUR CABLE NEWS,

46:01.466 --> 46:04.033
WE WANTED TO SHOW FUTURE

46:04.100 --> 46:04.766
AGGRESSORS IF YOU MESS WITH

46:04.833 --> 46:05.366
AMERICA ON THE BATTLEFIELD WE

46:05.433 --> 46:07.866
WILL ATOMIZE YOU BUT THAT'S NOT

46:07.933 --> 46:09.166
THE LESSON THE ENEMY TOOK.

46:09.233 --> 46:11.100
THE LESSON THEY TOOK WAS IF

46:11.166 --> 46:12.733
YOU'RE GOING TO MESS WITH

46:12.800 --> 46:13.466
AMERICA, DON'T GO ANYWHERE NEAR

46:13.533 --> 46:17.100
A BATTLEFIELD.

46:17.166 --> 46:17.733
THEY WERE DEVELOPING ALTERNATIVE

46:17.800 --> 46:21.700
ASYMMETRIC WAYS TO KILL US.

46:21.766 --> 46:22.966
CYBER.

46:23.033 --> 46:24.166
>> Bill: IT WOULD'VE HAPPENED

46:24.233 --> 46:24.400
ANYWAY.

46:24.466 --> 46:27.466
>> THEY WERE DOING CYBER

46:27.533 --> 46:28.266
INFORMATION, ECONOMIC WARFARE

46:28.333 --> 46:29.166
AND DOCTRINE TO HURT US WITHOUT

46:29.233 --> 46:31.300
FIRING A SHOT AND THEY ARE A

46:31.366 --> 46:32.533
GENERATION AHEAD OF US, BIDEN

46:32.600 --> 46:34.966
KNOWS THIS.

SOMETHING, TRY WHAT WE USED TO

46:38.433 --> 46:45.733
CALL THE GL THE DASH READ A BOOD

46:45.800 --> 46:49.233
UNRESTRICTED WARFARE BY TWO

46:50.700 --> 46:55.933
HEROES OF DESERT STORM DINOSAUR

46:56.000 --> 46:59.000
DINOSAURS.

46:59.066 --> 47:02.266

47:02.333 --> 47:03.866
BE WHAT YOU THINK IT IS.

47:03.933 --> 47:05.133
>> Bill: WE RUN OVER TIME, YOU

47:05.200 --> 47:06.000
GUYS WERE GREAT BUT IT'S TIME

47:06.066 --> 47:14.666
FOR NEW RULES.

47:14.733 --> 47:15.166
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

47:15.233 --> 47:15.966
NEW RULE: NOW THAT THE OLYMPICS

47:16.033 --> 47:16.733
HAS ADDED SKATEBOARDING AS AN

47:16.800 --> 47:17.433
OFFICIAL OLYMPIC SPORT, THEY

47:17.500 --> 47:18.800
MUST CHANGE THEIR DRUG POLICY SO

47:18.866 --> 47:19.500
THAT ATHLETES ARE BANNED IF THEY

47:19.566 --> 47:25.966
DON'T TEST POSITIVE FOR DRUGS.

47:26.033 --> 47:26.233
[LAUGHTER]

47:26.300 --> 47:27.200
NEW RULE: LOUISE FISCHER, THE

47:27.266 --> 47:27.900
DANISH RADIO JOURNALIST WHO

47:28.966 --> 47:31.433
SWINGERS CLUB BY INTERVIEWING A

47:31.500 --> 47:34.100
MAN WHILE SHE WAS HAVING SEX

47:34.166 --> 47:35.100
WITH HIM, MUST BE NOMINATED FOR

47:35.166 --> 47:37.633
A PULITZER PRIZE.

47:37.700 --> 47:39.133
LOTS OF REPORTERS COME ACROSS A

47:39.200 --> 47:40.300
GREAT STORY.

47:40.366 --> 47:41.366
BUT HOW MANY LET THE STORY COME

47:41.433 --> 47:47.400
ACROSS THEM?

47:47.466 --> 47:48.566
[LAUGHTER]

47:48.633 --> 47:52.633
[APPLAUSE]

47:52.700 --> 47:53.833
NEW RULE: IT'S NOT COOL TO BREAK

47:53.900 --> 47:55.000
UP WITH SOMEONE BY TEXT.

47:55.066 --> 47:58.000
IT'S TAKING THE COWARD'S WAY

47:58.066 --> 47:58.700
OUT.

47:58.766 --> 47:59.533
IT LEAVES YOUR PARTNER WITH NO

47:59.600 --> 48:00.600
SENSE OF CLOSURE.

48:00.666 --> 48:01.566
AND IT'S SUPER RUDE IF YOU DO IT

48:01.633 --> 48:06.100
WHILE YOU'RE LYING RIGHT NEXT TO

48:06.166 --> 48:07.900
THEM.

48:07.966 --> 48:08.166
[LAUGHTER]

48:08.233 --> 48:10.233
NEW RULE: HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK

48:10.300 --> 48:11.133
PHOTOS NEED TO GO BACK TO THE

48:11.200 --> 48:11.933

48:12.000 --> 48:18.066
USED TO LOOK.

48:18.133 --> 48:18.333
[LAUGHTER]

48:18.400 --> 48:18.700
[APPLAUSE]

48:18.766 --> 48:20.166
AS YOU AGE, YOU GET WORSE

48:20.233 --> 48:21.500
LOOKING.

48:21.566 --> 48:23.100
YOUR ONLY CONSOLATION IS THAT IN

48:23.166 --> 48:23.866
HIGH SCHOOL YOU LOOKED LIKE

48:23.933 --> 48:29.066
THIS.

48:29.133 --> 48:33.333
[LAUGHTER]

48:33.400 --> 48:34.033
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

48:34.100 --> 48:35.600
NEW RULE: SOMEONE MUST TELL ME

48:35.666 --> 48:37.566
WHY ROBOTS IN SCIENCE FICTION

48:37.633 --> 48:40.200
MOVIES ARE ALWAYS SO SARCASTIC.

48:40.266 --> 48:40.966
YOU'RE LOST IN SPACE AND THE

48:41.033 --> 48:42.066
ROBOT IS LIKE, "NICE GOING,

48:42.133 --> 48:47.600
MAGGELLAN."

48:47.666 --> 48:47.866
[LAUGHTER]

48:47.933 --> 48:49.033
ROBOTS ARE THE VERY LAST THING

48:49.100 --> 48:50.566
ON THE LIST THAT SHOULD BE

48:50.633 --> 48:51.800
SARCASTIC, AND I HOPE THAT

48:51.866 --> 48:56.233
EXTENDS TO SEX ROBOTS.

48:56.300 --> 48:56.500
[LAUGHTER]

48:56.566 --> 48:57.266
WHO WANTS TO FINISH AND HEAR,

48:57.333 --> 48:58.133
"THAT'S 90 SECONDS I'LL NEVER

48:58.200 --> 49:04.100
GET BACK"?

49:04.166 --> 49:06.966
THAT'S MY ROBOT VOICE.

49:07.033 --> 49:11.033
[APPLAUSE]

49:11.100 --> 49:11.300
[LAUGHTER]

49:11.366 --> 49:12.133
AND FINALLY, NEW RULE.

49:12.200 --> 49:13.066
AMERICANS NEED TO RE-WATCH KEN

49:13.133 --> 49:14.133
BURNS' GREAT DOCUMENTARY ON

49:14.200 --> 49:15.066
PROHIBITION, BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE

49:15.133 --> 49:16.033
STARTING TO NOTICE: AMERICA HAS

49:16.100 --> 49:17.566
A DRINKING PROBLEM.

49:17.633 --> 49:19.600
NOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'D EVER

49:19.666 --> 49:21.766
BE SO STUPID AS TO OUTLAW BOOZE

49:21.833 --> 49:23.266
AGAIN, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE

49:23.333 --> 49:25.033
SHOULDN'T TAKE NOTICE WHEN THE

49:25.100 --> 49:26.466
NATION GOES THROUGH ONE OF ITS

49:26.533 --> 49:27.266
PERIODIC BINGE-DRINKING PHASES

49:27.333 --> 49:30.566
LIKE WE ARE NOW.

49:30.633 --> 49:32.000
SINCE THE TURN OF THE

49:32.066 --> 49:33.266
MILLENNIUM, ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION

49:33.333 --> 49:34.366
IN THIS COUNTRY HAS RISEN

49:34.433 --> 49:35.300
STEADILY AND ALCOHOL-RELATED

49:35.366 --> 49:37.866
DEATHS HAVE DOUBLED.

49:37.933 --> 49:39.200
EVEN MILLENNIALS, WHO USED TO BE

49:39.266 --> 49:40.733
THE MORE SOBER GENERATION ARE

49:40.800 --> 49:41.933
NOW DYING OF CIRRHOSIS OF THE

49:42.000 --> 49:44.333
LIVER AT RECORD RATES.

49:44.400 --> 49:46.133
AND THAT WAS BEFORE COVID HIT,

49:46.200 --> 49:47.500
WHEN LOCKDOWN NATION REALLY HIT

49:47.566 --> 49:49.333
THE BOTTLE.

49:49.400 --> 49:51.666
THE PANDEMIC WAS AN EXCUSE FOR

49:51.733 --> 49:53.066
PEOPLE TO DRINK MORE, DRINK IN

49:53.133 --> 49:54.533
THE DAY, AND DRINK ALONE - A

49:54.600 --> 49:55.833
CONDITION PSYCHOLOGISTS CALL

49:55.900 --> 50:05.600
"MELANIA."

50:05.666 --> 50:07.666
[LAUGHTER]

50:07.733 --> 50:08.133
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

50:08.200 --> 50:08.833
WE LOST ALL SENSE OF TIME, AND

50:08.900 --> 50:09.866
THE RULES WENT OUT THE WINDOW.

50:09.933 --> 50:11.100
RESTAURANTS WERE DELIVERING

50:11.166 --> 50:12.433
COCKTAILS WITH HARD LIQUOR.

50:12.500 --> 50:13.633
I KNOW THIS BECAUSE THEY WERE

50:13.700 --> 50:21.666
DELIVERING THEM TO MY HOUSE.

50:21.733 --> 50:21.933
[LAUGHTER]

50:22.000 --> 50:22.200
[APPLAUSE]

50:22.266 --> 50:22.833
BECAUSE AS LONG AS I HAD LIQUOR,

50:22.900 --> 50:23.866
I DIDN'T CARE THERE WAS NO

50:23.933 --> 50:28.500
TOILET PAPER.

50:28.566 --> 50:28.766
[LAUGHTER]

50:28.833 --> 50:29.466
BUT JUST AS A HISTORICAL TREND,

50:29.533 --> 50:30.866
THIS CAN'T BE GOOD.

50:30.933 --> 50:32.266
THERE'S A WORD FOR WHEN EVERYONE

50:32.333 --> 50:33.433
IN SOCIETY GETS DRUNK JUST TO

50:33.500 --> 50:35.100
GET THROUGH THE DAY.

WAY FISHING IS REALLY JUST

52:38.266 --> 52:40.866

53:43.733 --> 53:49.333
"WHEN DID I ORDER SNOW SHOES?"

53:49.400 --> 53:51.766
THIS IS ALL EERILY FAMILIAR.

53:51.833 --> 53:53.700
IN THE PROHIBITION DOCUMENTARY

53:53.766 --> 53:55.866
THE FIRST EPISODE IS CALLED: A

53:57.133 --> 53:59.500
DESCRIBES HOW ON FARMS IN THE

53:59.566 --> 54:02.833
19TH CENTURY THERE WAS A BARREL

54:02.900 --> 54:03.933
OF HARD CIDER BY THE DOOR, WHICH

54:04.000 --> 54:04.533
YOU DIPPED INTO EVERY TIME YOU

54:04.600 --> 54:07.866
CAME AND WENT.

54:07.933 --> 54:08.800

54:21.500 --> 54:23.966

54:24.033 --> 54:26.300
WELL, HERE IN THE NOW TIMES, WE

54:26.366 --> 54:28.066
SEEM TO BE HEADING BACK IN THAT

54:28.133 --> 54:30.066
DIRECTION, AND I THINK THE

54:30.133 --> 54:32.366
REASON IS THIS: THE COVID

54:32.433 --> 54:33.833
EPIDEMIC MAY BE SUBSIDING, BUT

54:33.900 --> 54:36.300
THE EPIDEMIC THAT PRECEDED IT -

54:36.366 --> 54:39.233
THE ANXIETY EPIDEMIC - IS NOT.

54:39.300 --> 54:40.733
AND USUALLY WHEN PEOPLE DRINK

54:40.800 --> 54:41.833
IT'S TO ALLEVIATE SOME FORM OF

54:41.900 --> 54:44.600
ANXIETY.

54:44.666 --> 54:46.333
AS WE RE-ENTER SOCIETY, HALF OF

54:46.400 --> 54:47.566
AMERICANS SAY COVID HAS BEEN SO

54:47.633 --> 54:48.466
STRESSFUL THEY WORRY THEY'LL

54:48.533 --> 54:50.533
NEVER FULLY RECOVER.

54:50.600 --> 54:52.266
WE'RE USING LIQUOR AS A CRUTCH

54:52.333 --> 54:53.900
FOR OUR PANDEMIC-EXACERBATED

54:53.966 --> 54:55.000
PROBLEM OF BEING SOCIALLY

54:55.066 --> 54:57.266
IMPAIRED.

54:57.333 --> 54:58.500
WE CALL IT "SOCIAL" MEDIA, BUT

54:58.566 --> 55:01.466
REALLY IT'S THE OPPOSITE OF

55:01.533 --> 55:02.366
"SOCIAL," AND OUR INCREASING

55:02.433 --> 55:03.866
DETACHMENT FROM ONE ANOTHER IN

55:03.933 --> 55:06.433
REAL LIFE AND DEPENDENCE ON

55:06.500 --> 55:09.000
SCREENS AND ONLINE RELATIONSHIPS

55:09.066 --> 55:11.566
MAKES US EVER MORE VULNERABLE TO

55:11.633 --> 55:13.866
THE LURE OF LIQUID COURAGE WHEN

55:13.933 --> 55:17.400
IT COMES TO REALLY INTERACTING.

55:17.466 --> 55:20.033
BUT DRINKING IS NOT THE ANSWER.

55:20.100 --> 55:26.666
OKAY, IT'S PART OF THE ANSWER.

55:26.733 --> 55:29.166
I'M NOT GONNA LIE.

55:31.733 --> 55:32.600

55:32.666 --> 55:33.400
USING LIQUOR TO TAKE THE EDGE

55:33.466 --> 55:35.433
OFF.

55:35.500 --> 55:41.566
USUALLY OFF SOME OTHER DRUG, BUT

USUALLY OFF SOME OTHER DRUG, BUT

55:42.400 --> 55:43.633
STILL.

55:45.433 --> 55:46.366
NOT AT THE PIGGLY WIGGLY.
