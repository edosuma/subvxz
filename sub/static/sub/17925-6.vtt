Murder.

04:08.240 --> 04:13.872
I do not know how my brother
found Rabbi Leon.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.320
But he brung him from Paris

04:15.440 --> 04:20.560
in the hope he might know
how best to quiet my tempers.

04:20.680 --> 04:23.718
But that counsel,
he did not soothe me.

04:23.840 --> 04:25.558
It only roused my hunger.

04:25.680 --> 04:28.194
I had to feed it,

04:28.320 --> 04:31.551
cos, you see, miss,
he had shown me myself.

04:31.680 --> 04:33.114
My childhood self.

04:34.280 --> 04:35.759
I saw the forest...

04:37.120 --> 04:38.997
...and the ease and grace with...

04:39.120 --> 04:41.760
with which the wolves
might move through it...

04:44.400 --> 04:46.311
...whilst we simply trudged...

04:48.360 --> 04:51.113
...so heavy and...slow...

04:52.280 --> 04:56.672
...and as the rabbi spoke
of the morning they found her,

04:56.800 --> 04:59.394
I did not think
on the sight of my mother,

04:59.520 --> 05:00.794
no...

05:01.840 --> 05:04.195
...of my mother's body and blood.

05:07.360 --> 05:09.351
I thought only on their...

05:10.920 --> 05:12.274
...power...

05:14.240 --> 05:16.470
...the pure purpose of their need...

05:19.240 --> 05:21.470
...and how that need might be met.

05:23.160 --> 05:26.790
There's no frothing
or waterlogging to the lungs.

05:26.920 --> 05:31.756
There are, however, tiny
haemorrhages to the lining thereof,

05:31.880 --> 05:33.553
the burst capillaries
beneath the eyelids.

05:33.680 --> 05:35.717
The cause of death was suffocation.

05:37.600 --> 05:40.797
There are contusions
about the neck and face.

05:40.920 --> 05:43.719
Similarly to his fists.

05:43.840 --> 05:47.071
We may therefore presume
his death a violent one.

05:51.120 --> 05:53.509
Within the lining
of the respiratory tract,

05:53.640 --> 05:57.554
there are trace elements inhaled at
the point of death and adhered within.

05:57.680 --> 05:59.432
So, we have a wool fibre.

05:59.560 --> 06:04.111
The wool is an alpaca blend,
charcoal-grey in colour,

06:04.240 --> 06:06.629
most likely from the person
who throttled him.

06:06.760 --> 06:09.798
The suspect is frequently seen
sporting such an overcoat, Inspector.

06:09.920 --> 06:12.070
- Correct?
- DOVE: Grey alpaca.

06:12.200 --> 06:16.239
Am I the only man in London
with a woollen coat? No, I am not.

06:16.360 --> 06:19.193
You have no witness,
no physical evidence.

06:19.320 --> 06:21.789
You have no fingerprints, Mr Reid.

And, sir, that was Mr Isaac Bloom?

07:02.800 --> 07:04.154
Yes,

07:04.280 --> 07:08.638

they would take my acts...

07:11.400 --> 07:12.959
...and they would hand them to him.

you hunt for, please find it.

08:11.080 --> 08:13.230
on any soul with whom
he came into contact,

08:13.360 --> 08:16.637
particularly one which
was trying to kill him...

08:19.040 --> 08:20.917
...because he would have fought.

08:22.880 --> 08:24.871
He would have spat and screamed,

08:25.000 --> 08:28.277
he would have clutched and clawed
for the breathing of air,

08:28.400 --> 08:31.438
and he would have sprayed
that infection all over the man

08:31.560 --> 08:35.235
whose arms were now choking
the ten little years of life from him.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.352
Does a fever rise in you, sir?

08:41.480 --> 08:44.916

And, sir, will you confirm
your spoken confession

09:06.120 --> 09:07.997
that you murdered
Inspector Bennet Drake?

09:09.880 --> 09:10.870
Yes, miss.

09:12.480 --> 09:16.394
And Assistant Commissioner Dove
had full knowledge of this?

09:17.440 --> 09:19.397
Augustus knew it.

09:22.440 --> 09:25.080
Augustus knew it all.

09:25.200 --> 09:29.159
And, um...how was it
Augustus killed Abel?

09:29.280 --> 09:31.032
(SIGHS)

09:31.160 --> 09:34.391
Abel Croker wished to take my life...

09:36.120 --> 09:37.713
...but Augustus Dove, he...

09:40.320 --> 09:41.640
...he took his instead.

09:45.240 --> 09:47.072
Gustus saved me.

09:48.440 --> 09:49.510
Gustus...

09:51.280 --> 09:53.351
...always saved me.

09:59.880 --> 10:02.156
Reid, did you catch
scarlet fever as a boy?

10:02.280 --> 10:04.874
- I did.
- So did I. Caitlin too.

10:05.000 --> 10:09.119
Now, what that means is that, once
caught, we cannot catch it again.

10:09.240 --> 10:11.550
Now, Miss Morton, I believe,
has not suffered it before,

10:11.680 --> 10:13.079
because she suffers it now.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.919
And where else
might she have contracted it,

10:16.040 --> 10:19.590
but from a sickly child
who's taking refuge with her?

10:23.840 --> 10:27.435
It's like a string of purple pearls.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.790

12:15.040 --> 12:18.158
It is a cat-meat soup, Teddy.

You should know
your own presence here,

12:21.080 --> 12:24.914

it's unconscionable.

But, under current circumstances,

12:28.040 --> 12:32.034
there is one more intervention
you might perform for us.

12:37.040 --> 12:38.997
There will be an inquiry, internal,

what Edmund Reid's fate shall be.

12:52.120 --> 12:53.918
Sudden illness.

Lengthy convalescence.

12:56.440 --> 12:58.272

buried deep and forgot.

he is to be choked and in short order.

14:45.720 --> 14:47.711

14:52.320 --> 14:55.073
What else, Edmund? Clemency?

14:57.960 --> 15:00.952
- And the Captain?
- Send him home.

15:01.080 --> 15:02.718
Where he belongs. Besides...

15:02.840 --> 15:08.358
it is not the fate of that evil pair
brings me to you now, but your own.

15:08.480 --> 15:11.074
And that too is decided, I imagine?

15:12.080 --> 15:13.593
A little further yet.

15:22.120 --> 15:23.599
That is right, my friend.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.437
Think of what you and I once found
in a tenement room

15:27.560 --> 15:29.551
off that courtyard beyond.

15:30.600 --> 15:34.275
The cut and strewn remains
of the Ripper's last victim.

15:35.520 --> 15:37.238
Ten years ago, Edmund.

15:37.360 --> 15:39.397
Ten years.

15:39.520 --> 15:44.549
That barbarism then, that which these
Dove brothers have only now enacted.

15:46.480 --> 15:48.835
They were forged
from the same furnace,

15:48.960 --> 15:53.670
a furnace which requires
permanent vigilance, Edmund.

15:53.800 --> 15:57.111
A watchman...set for the night,

15:57.240 --> 16:00.358
when that fire finds
another crack in the world

16:00.480 --> 16:03.359
and sets its creatures free
once more.

16:11.040 --> 16:13.270
Bennet Drake was a fine man.

16:13.400 --> 16:14.720
But he...

16:16.320 --> 16:18.357
That paleface Drummond,

16:18.480 --> 16:21.233
they do not see.

16:22.240 --> 16:24.629
Not in the way you see.

16:24.760 --> 16:26.751
You are needed here, Mr Reid.

16:28.160 --> 16:29.480
My crimes?

16:31.160 --> 16:32.992
Wish to face them, do you?

16:33.120 --> 16:34.793
They are true. I would own them.

16:34.920 --> 16:40.313
I am to tell you that such an owning
will not find favour...

16:41.880 --> 16:47.000
...and to extend Commissioner
Bradford's wish and invitation

16:47.120 --> 16:52.320
for Edmund Reid to resume
his command at Leman Street.

16:57.640 --> 17:00.109
That is some bold denial to mount.

17:01.160 --> 17:04.949
It is a public redemption
of a good man wronged.

17:05.079 --> 17:06.400
And if I refuse?

17:08.720 --> 17:12.679
Well, then, your American will not
find himself so easily forgot.

17:12.800 --> 17:16.839
In point of fact,
his many misdemeanours will be

17:16.960 --> 17:19.759
pursued with full rigour...

17:21.040 --> 17:24.112
...and he will dangle, Edmund.

17:39.640 --> 17:41.790
Wait. Wait. Please.
Please, please. Please, wait.

17:41.920 --> 17:44.958
No! Don't! Stop!
Don't! Stop! Leave him!

17:45.080 --> 17:47.196
No, please! Where do you take him?

17:59.080 --> 18:02.277
JACKSON: I'm with you, darling.
I'm coming too.

18:04.440 --> 18:06.556
Come with me, Miss Hart.

18:08.080 --> 18:10.833
Wait, Drummond.
What...what about me?

18:10.960 --> 18:13.873
What about me, God damn it?
What...what about me? Take me.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.116
Your prisoner, Mr Reid.

18:18.200 --> 18:20.032
Reid? What the hell?

18:20.160 --> 18:21.992
Where's he taking her?

18:30.920 --> 18:32.877
Reid?

18:34.760 --> 18:36.114
Reid?

18:42.760 --> 18:45.639

Caitlin! Caitlin.

19:07.320 --> 19:09.038
You sons of bitches!

19:09.160 --> 19:10.833
- Let him go.
- Let me go!

19:10.960 --> 19:12.758
- Let me go!
- Let him go.

19:12.880 --> 19:14.712
God damn it!

19:14.840 --> 19:16.513
For him?

19:18.480 --> 19:20.835
You did this for him?

19:20.960 --> 19:23.952
I did it before.
I'll do it again. I'll save you.

19:24.080 --> 19:27.072
No. No, you will not.

19:28.280 --> 19:30.317
You are a father now.

19:30.440 --> 19:32.511
What kind of example
would that be for our son?

19:32.640 --> 19:33.550
No.

19:33.680 --> 19:35.876
What kind would I be,
if I let you die?

19:36.000 --> 19:38.389
But you must, you see.

19:39.640 --> 19:42.519
Because he must have
one of us to care for him...

19:44.280 --> 19:46.510
...and it seems that one will be you.

19:47.760 --> 19:49.592
It was you and me.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.277
You and me.

19:55.400 --> 19:57.630
And it ever will be.

19:57.760 --> 19:59.956
Because of our boy.

20:00.080 --> 20:02.117
We are in him.

20:02.240 --> 20:03.435
One.

20:05.040 --> 20:08.032
So, you go and you raise him good.

20:08.160 --> 20:09.355
Raise him right.

20:10.760 --> 20:13.070
I'll think of how we were made

20:13.200 --> 20:15.237
and I'll do the reverse.

20:28.120 --> 20:30.430
I love you.

20:32.200 --> 20:34.032
I will never stop.

20:40.120 --> 20:41.997
Please, Mr Drummond,

20:42.120 --> 20:43.713
take me away.

21:30.040 --> 21:31.110
Bye.

21:31.240 --> 21:32.958

21:37.280 --> 21:40.272

just leave her be now.

21:44.560 --> 21:45.880
No.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.593
Please.

22:05.760 --> 22:08.513

22:55.520 --> 22:56.794
What?

23:01.640 --> 23:03.199

24:30.320 --> 24:32.357
Do not let them touch.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.355
We are to go together, then.

24:43.480 --> 24:45.869
- One after the other.
- Mm-hm.

24:48.120 --> 24:50.270
They've found a priest
who speaks my mother's tongue.

24:50.400 --> 24:55.349
He says if...if I am repenting,
I should be spared hell.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.118
But why should I be spared it
just for the saying of some words?

25:00.240 --> 25:02.550
But you feel the regret?

25:06.840 --> 25:08.114
Nothing but.

25:08.240 --> 25:11.915
Miss Susan,
they must be allowed to proceed.

25:13.240 --> 25:15.880
Perhaps I shall speak
with this priest after all.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.150
Forgive her, I shall say...

25:19.200 --> 25:20.918
...and let her see
her Connor once more.

25:24.240 --> 25:25.310
I should be grateful.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.310
You are my daughter, and I worry.

31:10.440 --> 31:11.430
Don't.

31:15.240 --> 31:18.437
Remember the conviction
that you held that I was alive?

31:19.520 --> 31:20.794
Yes, of course.

31:20.920 --> 31:22.593
Then surely it is not such a struggle

31:22.720 --> 31:25.838
to hold the simpler belief
that I am well?

Mr Reid.

Samuel.

31:40.160 --> 31:41.150
Right.

- You will visit, of course?
- No, Drum.

Well, I shall add it to the catalogue.

33:00.880 --> 33:02.553
These are not clues, Fred.

33:02.680 --> 33:06.116
They are half-glimpsed imaginings,
a tangle of shadows,

33:06.240 --> 33:07.913
and you and I floundering at them,

33:08.040 --> 33:11.795
in the ever-vainer hope that
we might corral them into meaning,

33:11.920 --> 33:13.593
when we will not.

33:13.720 --> 33:15.074
We will not.

33:25.080 --> 33:26.400
I said.

33:27.760 --> 33:30.400
I almost begged it of you
when you lost her.

Forgive me.

went down on that boat.

Tend to your wife. Take the leave.

33:45.280 --> 33:47.794
- You are clue it.
- I prefer to work.

33:47.920 --> 33:49.991
Then work, Edmund!

- No, no.

34:20.480 --> 34:22.232

34:22.360 --> 34:23.793

look me in the eye,

34:23.920 --> 34:26.036
without the wish to spit in it
and curse me for the loss of her.

34:26.159 --> 34:28.275
So...no home.

34:32.040 --> 34:34.156
- Come, sir, please.
- No! Damn you!

34:34.280 --> 34:37.351
Damn your care!
Damn your endless fawning!

Are you a dog?

34:39.360 --> 34:40.475
Are you?

34:40.600 --> 34:43.399
- I am not, Inspector.
- Then stop following me!

34:45.880 --> 34:47.791
It shan't bring you any good.

35:09.400 --> 35:14.395
That's it, up a bit. More, more,
more to me. How's that, sir?

35:14.520 --> 35:16.272
Afternoon, Inspector.

35:20.040 --> 35:21.713
Six months they're gone.

35:22.800 --> 35:25.838
He is now a teacher. She, erm...

35:25.960 --> 35:27.792
She writes a novel, she says,

35:27.920 --> 35:29.479
and the child prospers.

35:29.600 --> 35:31.557
Have you been to see her, the child?

35:31.680 --> 35:32.750
Er...no. Not yet, no.

35:32.880 --> 35:35.190
Your granddaughter, Edmund.

35:35.320 --> 35:36.913
Soon, however.

35:37.040 --> 35:39.634
I shall, erm, take some holiday.

35:45.920 --> 35:47.752
And so, your visit?

35:52.760 --> 35:56.276
This is the death certificate
of a woman named Mary Spinks.

35:56.400 --> 35:59.552
Her named husband, see,
is George Chapman,

35:59.680 --> 36:01.353
only that is not his true name.

36:02.480 --> 36:04.357
Sorry, Fred, but...

36:04.480 --> 36:08.633
George Chapman only became so in 1895.

36:08.760 --> 36:11.639
Before that, however, he was called...

36:11.760 --> 36:14.354
Severin Klosowski.

36:15.520 --> 36:19.400
The Severin Klosowski who was once a
suspect of ours in the Ripper murders?

36:19.520 --> 36:22.194
But he has gone to America.

36:22.320 --> 36:24.960
Not since 1892, he has not.

36:25.080 --> 36:27.037
He has returned to this country.

36:28.360 --> 36:31.751
Ah. Confidential autopsy report.

36:33.480 --> 36:35.118
His wife.

36:35.240 --> 36:36.878
He beat her.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.674
Ceaselessly. You know?

36:39.800 --> 36:42.792
- He's a brute, I'm sure.
- And more than that.

36:42.920 --> 36:45.036
Severin Klosowski.

36:45.160 --> 36:50.360
1885, he finishes his surgical studies
at the Praga Hospital in Warsaw.

36:50.480 --> 36:53.040
June '87, he's in London as a barber,

36:53.160 --> 36:54.878
a position in a shop

36:55.000 --> 36:58.755
on the corner of Whitechapel
High Street and George Yard...

36:58.880 --> 37:01.554
Yes, the skills and the knives,
Fred. I do not forget.

37:01.680 --> 37:05.639
George Yard, where Martha Tabram
was killed in August '88.

37:05.760 --> 37:07.797
I never credited Miss Tabram as his.

37:07.920 --> 37:09.593
Oh, did you not?

37:09.720 --> 37:12.712
And the world must kowtow to
Ed Reid's theories, must it?

37:12.840 --> 37:14.274
Not mine, no.

37:14.400 --> 37:15.993
Her killer was right-handed.
The Ripper used his left.

37:16.120 --> 37:18.714
You know that, Fred, you know that,
and you sit here now

37:18.840 --> 37:22.196
in the belief I might recommence
those same investigations.

37:22.320 --> 37:25.836
- The file remains open, Inspector.
- And what?!

37:25.960 --> 37:28.998
A man we once identified as a suspect
has a wife who dies of consumption,

37:29.120 --> 37:32.078
and you are roused
from your retirement to berate me

37:32.200 --> 37:35.272
that I do not set myself
and my station house to his capture?

37:35.400 --> 37:38.313
Read the autopsy, Inspector!

37:38.440 --> 37:42.149
Consumption would present itself as
a hardening rash on the arms and legs.

37:42.280 --> 37:45.750
What she had were pustular swellings
around the eyes and mouth.

37:45.880 --> 37:48.679
Now, I am not your American surgeon,

37:48.800 --> 37:50.916
but I know the symptoms
of antimony poisoning.

37:51.040 --> 37:51.996
Fred! Fred.

37:52.120 --> 37:56.398
Even if it were true and proved,
it is still only a poisoning.

37:56.520 --> 37:59.353
The man that we hunted
eviscerated his victims.

37:59.480 --> 38:02.438
He ripped the flesh
and the organs from their bodies.

38:02.560 --> 38:08.431
Nevertheless, it is murder by a man
we know capable of that evisceration,

38:08.560 --> 38:10.198
who was proximate to the acts,

38:10.320 --> 38:12.755
who even now is abroad in this town,

38:12.880 --> 38:16.157
acting out his hatred of women
upon their bodies.

38:16.280 --> 38:17.953
Means. Opportunity.

38:18.080 --> 38:19.070
Motive.

38:21.080 --> 38:23.196
Will you bring him in?

38:25.640 --> 38:26.755
No, I will not.

38:26.880 --> 38:29.394
For why?

38:29.520 --> 38:31.670
Because it is a fancy.

38:31.800 --> 38:36.033
It's a dark daydream in the mind
of a retired police officer,

38:36.160 --> 38:39.551
who would do better to return
to his roses and his wife.

38:39.680 --> 38:41.398
It is a case, Edmund.

38:41.520 --> 38:43.750
No, it is a ghost...

38:46.320 --> 38:47.833
...and a dead one at that.

you've heard the last of this.

Sir. I write as regards my execution of

in which you are mentioned
as beneficiary.

43:20.920 --> 43:24.356
His assets were limited, but the
enclosed was to be forwarded to you

whatever the circumstances
of Mr Judge's past,

43:33.160 --> 43:36.915
his son Connor Judge has now become
the ward of this office here.

43:37.040 --> 43:39.953
We are also the executors,
under grant of probate,

43:40.080 --> 43:43.710

Master Judge named sole heir

I am expected to stand there

and yet I cannot find the explanation.

48:33.600 --> 48:36.353

are beyond such?

they are not dreadful.
