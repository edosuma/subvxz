23:21.150 --> 23:23.391
Yeah, Of course I did. At first.

23:23.903 --> 23:27.566
But then it turned into something different,
something pure.

23:27.656 --> 23:28.691
Hmm.

23:28.782 --> 23:32.400
I watched him work his way up
from a cubicle to a corner Office.

23:32.661 --> 23:36.779
He had the whole staff believing in
something besides numbers for once.

23:37.374 --> 23:39.751
And most importantly... Most importantly,

23:40.336 --> 23:42.668
that's a guy who's learned from his mistakes.

23:43.839 --> 23:46.751
I'm glad to hear
that he's learned from his mistakes,

23:46.842 --> 23:49.754
but every man needs
to be held accountable for his actions.

23:50.554 --> 23:52.010
Then hold him accountable.

23:54.683 --> 23:58.096
Anthony's got outstanding foot quickness,
good balance and technique.

23:58.187 --> 24:00.849
Yeah, he's a little undersized
and needs to improve as a drive blocker,

24:00.940 --> 24:02.396
but I think he's a natural.

24:04.318 --> 24:06.104
Same thing could be said for you.

24:06.195 --> 24:08.777
I've seen you in the building
at 5:00 am. all week.

24:08.864 --> 24:11.196
-How you know that?
-l'm here at 4:30.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.774
And if you start coming at 4:30,
I'll come at 4:15.

24:13.869 --> 24:15.109
(CHUCKLES)

24:15.204 --> 24:17.445
You know, I've been doing
research on edge rushers.

24:17.539 --> 24:20.781
If a guy can't run a 10-yard dash
in 1.6 seconds or less,

24:20.876 --> 24:25.119
his chances Of becoming an effective pass
rusher in this league drops severely.

24:25.214 --> 24:26.624
Meanwhile, maybe two players

24:26.715 --> 24:28.580
-run that split the entire draft.
-Thank you.

24:28.676 --> 24:30.792
And the coaching staff
is up my ass to pick linebackers.

24:30.886 --> 24:32.251
Anthony could become an All-Pro

24:32.346 --> 24:34.337
and the coaches will bitch
that we didn't find two of him.

24:34.431 --> 24:37.047
Another losing season has only dialed up
the dysfunction around here.

24:37.142 --> 24:38.723
I need someone I can trust.

24:39.228 --> 24:40.593
I wanna promote you, Charles.

24:41.063 --> 24:42.348
Make you my number two.

24:42.439 --> 24:44.930
First order Of business
will be to get you out on the road.

24:45.025 --> 24:46.936
Scarlet and Gray game at Ohio State.

24:47.403 --> 24:48.563
I've never been to the Horseshoe.

24:48.654 --> 24:50.485
From there, you hit all the big-time programs.

24:50.572 --> 24:52.824
Get an early look at the 2017 draft class.

24:53.534 --> 24:57.072
You know, you could tell as much
about a player's character in a May scrimmage

24:57.162 --> 24:59.073
as you can from playing in a bowl game.

24:59.373 --> 25:01.659
You'll be on the road
for the next couple Of months.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.126
That's gonna be all right?

25:06.338 --> 25:08.545
Yes, sir. NO problem at all.

25:08.632 --> 25:09.917
Good.

25:11.051 --> 25:13.508
JAY: It's not your right to play in this league,
it's your privilege.

25:13.595 --> 25:15.426
I'll tell you right now,
there's a ton Of guys out there

25:15.514 --> 25:17.175
who are bigger, faster,
stronger than all Of you,

25:17.266 --> 25:18.847
and they're working retail right now.

25:18.934 --> 25:20.640
It's actually not hard to succeed
in this league, guys.

25:20.728 --> 25:23.094
All you gotta really do...
Don't screw up Off the field

25:23.188 --> 25:24.689
and outwork everybody else on it.

25:24.773 --> 25:26.104
I talked about privilege earlier.

25:26.191 --> 25:28.603
It's my privilege right now
to bring somebody on

25:28.694 --> 25:32.278
who wasn't scheduled to speak,
but wants a couple minutes Of your time.

25:32.364 --> 25:35.606
Listen to what this man has to say.
He's been around the block.

25:35.701 --> 25:38.192

26:09.818 --> 26:11.479

26:11.570 --> 26:12.901
some Of you have seen me play,

26:12.988 --> 26:16.822
and I'm sure just as many Of you
have no idea who the fuck I even am.

26:22.831 --> 26:23.991
(SCATTERED LAUGHTER)

26:24.374 --> 26:27.707
I guess I should've retired
when the Dolphins traded me to New Orleans.

26:28.587 --> 26:31.169
But, you know, this is a cruel game we play.

26:32.341 --> 26:34.081
You get so hooked on it,

26:34.176 --> 26:37.714
they gotta put you in a straitjacket
and drag your ass Off the field

26:38.138 --> 26:41.346
because when you're playing,
as you guys know,

26:41.433 --> 26:43.094
you're all king shit.

26:43.685 --> 26:46.518
Right? You're the masters Of the universe.

26:46.730 --> 26:49.938
Young, tough, good-looking, rich,

26:59.576 --> 27:02.192
You feel like you can do anything
you set your mind to.

27:03.205 --> 27:07.824
Well, a lot Of you are gonna soon find out
that you can't.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.170
You see that man right there?

27:20.722 --> 27:23.304
That's Eddie George, Heisman Trophy winner,

27:23.392 --> 27:27.180
Rookie Of the Year, four-time Pro Bowler,

27:27.271 --> 27:29.683
over 10,000 yards rushing,

27:29.773 --> 27:33.937
and at one time my very close friend.

27:34.862 --> 27:36.227
I thought I could make him a rich man

27:36.321 --> 27:40.781
and I convinced him to go in
on a real estate deal...

27:43.787 --> 27:45.163
And give me his money.

27:45.247 --> 27:46.783
Notjust a little bit.

27:47.624 --> 27:49.034
All of it.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.205
And I lost it.

27:53.797 --> 27:55.708
I lost every fucking cent.

27:58.969 --> 28:00.584
And I lost a friend.

28:05.559 --> 28:09.051
But the truth is
I don't even deserve to be that man's friend.

28:13.025 --> 28:15.937
I don't even deserve
to be up here talking to any Of you.

28:19.907 --> 28:22.148
I deserve exactly what I got...

28:25.287 --> 28:26.948
Nothing.

28:30.792 --> 28:34.330
And if some Of you assholes
out there don't smarten up,

28:34.922 --> 28:36.958
that's exactly
what you're gonna wind up with.

in a $5,000 suit who takes you.

28:41.887 --> 28:45.596
It's gonna be your brother, your sister,
your parents, it's gonna be your friend.

It's gonna be someone like me

29:14.670 --> 29:16.535
