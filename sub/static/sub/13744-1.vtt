01:36.840 --> 01:40.435
Bets around, bets around.
Let's go, Jameson.

01:41.920 --> 01:45.230
Everybody in? Atkins, Atkins?

01:46.120 --> 01:48.680
Oh, come on, man, let's go.

01:49.560 --> 01:52.677
No, man, your sister
didn't send me that check yet.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.752
No, this is how you play the...
This is how you play Texas Hold 'em.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.996
You just told us how to play it!

02:14.240 --> 02:16.879
This is how you play Texas Hold â€˜em.

02:19.680 --> 02:22.558
Will you flip another card.
This is the fourth fucking...

02:25.080 --> 02:27.799
- Four of a kind.
- What do you got, Melvin?

02:29.920 --> 02:31.148
Yo, Melvin, man,
what you gonna do,

02:31.360 --> 02:33.510
you gonna play the cards
or you gonna hatch them?

02:33.720 --> 02:37.633
I ain't gonna hatch them. I need to
run out to the ATM real quick.

02:39.480 --> 02:40.993
There's gotta be a...

02:41.200 --> 02:43.156
Gotta be a 7-Eleven
out there somewhere.

02:47.240 --> 02:48.275
Let me get two.

03:23.480 --> 03:25.072
So why don't we just go directly in.

03:25.480 --> 03:27.471
Right up this route, straight in.

03:27.880 --> 03:31.236
Yes, well, I see the captain
enjoys the road less traveled.

03:31.440 --> 03:33.476
No, the captain enjoys
not going down the highway,

03:33.680 --> 03:37.639
dragging his ass so every Tom, Dick
and Qaddafi can take a whack at it.

03:38.480 --> 03:39.799
It's very bad here.

03:40.640 --> 03:43.234
It's bad here, it's still bad here.

03:43.440 --> 03:45.396
And I've heard it's bad
right down here.

03:45.800 --> 03:47.631
- Bad everywhere, huh?
- Yeah.

03:47.840 --> 03:48.875
Mines?

03:49.440 --> 03:51.112
Tricky. Swedish-made.

03:57.720 --> 04:00.598
The man didn't say anything
about mines to me.

04:01.400 --> 04:03.197
Sergeant Shaw.

04:08.040 --> 04:10.395
- Sergeant.
- Sir.

04:10.600 --> 04:12.750
Rolling in two minutes.

04:12.960 --> 04:14.313
Yes, sir.

04:15.120 --> 04:16.439
You okay?

04:17.160 --> 04:18.752
Yes, sir.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.513
Two minutes.

04:23.320 --> 04:25.709
Yo, give me two cards, man.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.711
Captain says we're moving out.

04:48.400 --> 04:49.879
So...

04:54.880 --> 04:58.190
Hey, that cat needs a friend.
And a hug.

04:59.200 --> 05:01.839
<i>It was just before Desert Storm.</i>

05:02.040 --> 05:05.271
<i>We were on a routine recon</i>
<i>inside Iraqi-controlled terrain,</i>

05:05.480 --> 05:07.198
<i>assessing enemy troop strength</i>

05:07.400 --> 05:11.552
<i>for what Saddam Hussein promised</i>
<i>would be the mother of all wars.</i>

05:12.880 --> 05:15.269
<i>I'm in the lead vehicle</i>
<i>with Sergeant Shaw</i>

05:15.480 --> 05:18.517
<i>and our guide, a civilian contractor.</i>

05:18.720 --> 05:21.393
<i>The night is clear.</i>
<i>Stars, but no moon.</i>

05:24.240 --> 05:25.195
Ambush!

05:28.960 --> 05:30.359
Hang on.

05:37.400 --> 05:39.789
Exit the vehicle.
On me! On me!

05:40.200 --> 05:41.519
Get a flare up, sergeant.

05:50.360 --> 05:53.557
Enemy dismount! Go after, go after!
Stay left!

05:53.760 --> 05:55.159
Covering, covering, covering!

05:55.360 --> 05:56.759
Bear right!

05:56.960 --> 05:58.712
Move it, move it, move it!

06:16.360 --> 06:17.793
Captain Marco!

06:20.080 --> 06:21.308
<i>Sir?</i>

06:22.240 --> 06:23.753
Was you scared?

06:25.520 --> 06:27.317
Scared? Well...

06:27.920 --> 06:30.798
...there was really no time
to be scared.

06:31.840 --> 06:35.150
<i>With complete disregard</i>
<i>for his own life,</i>

06:35.360 --> 06:38.830
<i>Sergeant Raymond Shaw</i>
<i>engaged single-handedly</i>

06:39.400 --> 06:41.231
<i>an entire company of the enemy.</i>

06:45.280 --> 06:48.078
Sergeant Shaw was awarded
the Medal of Honor.

06:48.280 --> 06:50.669
I signed the recommendation myself.

06:51.960 --> 06:53.552
Yes, sir.

06:53.760 --> 06:55.557
Were you wounded?

06:55.760 --> 06:56.909
I was, I was injured.

06:57.440 --> 07:00.591
Concussion, lost focus.
Sergeant Shaw, he took command.

07:00.800 --> 07:02.153
Major?

07:03.000 --> 07:05.878
- Yes.
- Did your unit sustain any casualties?

07:06.080 --> 07:10.198
Yes. PFC Edward Ingram,

07:10.400 --> 07:14.439
PFC Robert Baker III
were killed.

07:14.880 --> 07:17.394
Now, the Medal of Honor,
Congressional Medal of Honor,

07:17.680 --> 07:21.070
is the highest award that any soldier
could aspire to.

07:21.280 --> 07:23.874
What these brave men
that I've talked about today did

07:24.080 --> 07:26.469
should never be forgotten.

07:26.680 --> 07:31.800
Since 1917, there have only been
970 Medals awarded,

07:32.000 --> 07:35.913
out of a total of 30 million
Americans at arms.

07:36.280 --> 07:37.872
Who knows.

07:38.080 --> 07:40.594
Maybe one day,
one of you fine young men

07:41.560 --> 07:44.632
will earn that medal
in defense of this great nation.

07:46.720 --> 07:47.755
Yes.

07:47.960 --> 07:51.475
Major Marco,
on behalf of Troops 1094 and 1128,

07:51.680 --> 07:53.272
just wanna thank you

07:53.480 --> 07:55.277
for coming to speak to us
about the Medal of Honor

07:55.480 --> 07:59.155
and about your interesting experiences
in the armed forces.

07:59.360 --> 08:01.078
Thanks for listening.

08:06.880 --> 08:07.835
Thank you very much.

08:08.240 --> 08:10.674
You ever wish it had been you?

08:11.320 --> 08:13.117
I'm sorry, excuse me?

08:14.240 --> 08:16.117
Won the Medal.

08:17.120 --> 08:18.678
Been... Been the hero.

08:19.760 --> 08:23.275
Well, sir, I'm just...
I'm just proud that I was there.

08:23.480 --> 08:24.913
Thank you.

08:25.800 --> 08:27.472
Thank you very much.

08:49.080 --> 08:51.310
- Major Marco?
- Yes.

08:53.280 --> 08:54.952
Al Melvin, sir.

08:57.920 --> 08:59.512
Corporal Melvin.

09:00.680 --> 09:02.830
From your unit, Desert Storm.

09:03.760 --> 09:06.752
Corporal Melvin. How you doing?

09:09.200 --> 09:11.430
I have these dreams, sir.

09:11.920 --> 09:14.115
- Dreams?
- Yes, sir.

09:15.480 --> 09:18.677
Kuwait. It's you and me,

09:18.880 --> 09:21.917
Ingram and Baker and...

09:23.520 --> 09:24.919
...Raymond Shaw.

09:26.560 --> 09:27.754
Okay.

09:28.320 --> 09:31.710
See, I remember it happened
like you just said,

09:31.920 --> 09:33.319
and then...

09:34.240 --> 09:35.753
...I don't.

09:37.240 --> 09:38.878
Well...

09:39.080 --> 09:40.877
...we had it pretty rough
over there, Melvin.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.150
That was a long time ago.
Memories shift.

09:47.360 --> 09:49.396
Do you have dreams, sir?

09:49.760 --> 09:50.988
Everybody has dreams, corporal.

09:51.200 --> 09:52.872
No, not these.

09:53.560 --> 09:54.913
No, I don't.

09:57.760 --> 10:01.116
I write it all down.
You know, like, every night,

10:01.320 --> 10:05.632
right when I wake up,
I try to get it down.

10:05.840 --> 10:07.592
It doesn't always come together,
you know,

10:07.800 --> 10:09.074
not everything that I can remember.

10:10.120 --> 10:13.237
Maybe you should go
to the V.A. Hospital,

10:13.440 --> 10:14.509
talk to one of the doctors.

10:14.720 --> 10:16.756
- I've been to doctors, man.
- Okay.

10:20.640 --> 10:23.313
I'm just... I'm just...

10:25.040 --> 10:27.554
I'm just a little stuck, sir.

10:27.760 --> 10:30.957
Because I remember, okay, Shaw...

10:31.160 --> 10:34.152
Shaw, okay...
Shaw saving us, right...

10:34.760 --> 10:36.876
...but that doesn't make sense,
because...

10:38.840 --> 10:40.990
...that should've been you.

10:41.200 --> 10:44.192
Okay, if Shaw is in the Hummer...

10:44.640 --> 10:46.596
...the Toyota is here...

10:46.800 --> 10:49.394
All right. Just get up, get up.

10:49.600 --> 10:51.033
Listen, it's...

10:51.240 --> 10:55.074
That's over with. That's done.
Okay? You gotta move on.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.077
What I was hoping is that,
you know, maybe...

10:57.280 --> 10:58.395
You need some money
or something?

10:58.600 --> 10:59.715
- No, no, sir.
- Wait a minute.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.831
I don't need your money, man.

11:02.440 --> 11:04.556
All right. It was great to see you.

11:26.760 --> 11:29.035
Paper or plastic, sir?

11:30.560 --> 11:35.031
<i>With public anxiety being rekindled</i>
<i>by the events of Bloody Friday,</i>

11:35.240 --> 11:40.360
<i>with the war on terror continuing into</i>
<i>yet another year, no end in sight,</i>

11:40.560 --> 11:43.199
<i>the worries just continue to grow.</i>

11:43.400 --> 11:45.709
<i>Polls indicate that</i>
<i>more and more voters</i>

11:45.920 --> 11:49.037
<i>are concerned with</i>
<i>personal family safety,</i>

11:49.240 --> 11:51.151
<i>with economic security,</i>

11:51.360 --> 11:54.318
<i>fearing more and more jobs</i>
<i>going overseas</i>

11:54.520 --> 11:57.990
<i>or being taken by</i>
<i>illegal immigrants.</i>

11:58.200 --> 12:02.079
<i>They're concerned with the quality</i>
<i>of air and our water,</i>

12:02.280 --> 12:05.636
<i>the degradation caused by the</i>
<i>rollback in environmental regulations,</i>

12:05.840 --> 12:08.991
<i>by religious and racial polarization,</i>

12:09.200 --> 12:13.591
<i>with the drumbeat of body bags</i>
<i>coming from all over the globe.</i>

12:13.800 --> 12:16.997
<i>The American people are ready</i>
<i>for a new agenda.</i>

12:17.200 --> 12:21.830
<i>But because this party is so</i>
<i>divided on so many issues,</i>

12:22.040 --> 12:25.874
<i>the choice of a vice presidential</i>
<i>nominee may very well be</i>

12:26.080 --> 12:29.868
<i>the unifying factor for delegates</i>
<i>at this convention.</i>

12:30.240 --> 12:32.754
<i>And if this respect propels me</i>
<i>toward the nomination</i>

12:32.960 --> 12:37.238
<i>as your vice presidential candidate,</i>
<i>I will be greatly honored.</i>

12:37.560 --> 12:42.076
<i>We need to look inward,</i>
<i>attend to our own house.</i>

12:42.960 --> 12:46.350
<i>The danger to our country is not only</i>
<i>from some terrorists at large,</i>

12:46.560 --> 12:49.233
<i>terrorists who, by the way,</i>
<i>we've helped engender</i>

12:49.560 --> 12:52.279
<i>with 20 years</i>
<i>of failed foreign policy.</i>

12:52.480 --> 12:57.076
<i>No, the real danger</i>
<i>is from suspending civil liberties,</i>

12:57.520 --> 12:59.875
<i>gutting the Bill of Rights,</i>
<i>allowing our fear</i>

13:00.080 --> 13:02.275
<i>to destroy our democratic ideals,</i>

13:02.480 --> 13:06.234
<i>because once we start overturning</i>
<i>our constitutional protections,</i>

13:06.440 --> 13:07.919
<i>our enemies have won.</i>

13:11.200 --> 13:12.758
Raymond?

13:12.960 --> 13:14.757
- There he is.
- Darling.

13:14.960 --> 13:18.475
What, were you gonna make me
stand out there like room service?

13:22.240 --> 13:26.472
I asked downstairs and Miss Freeman,
your wrangler, helpful Miss Freeman,

13:26.680 --> 13:30.389
she said you were up here
practicing your speech.

13:30.600 --> 13:32.591
I don't honestly understand why

13:32.800 --> 13:35.473
you insist upon
isolating yourself, Raymond.

13:35.680 --> 13:37.716
People adore you,
they crave your company,

13:37.920 --> 13:39.273
and yet here you are,

13:39.480 --> 13:41.710
holed up as if you were some sort of

13:41.920 --> 13:45.390
emotionally challenged individual
like your father.

13:45.600 --> 13:50.151
Shut up, Tom.
Instead of Raymond Prentiss Shaw,

13:50.720 --> 13:52.915
handsome, intelligent,

13:53.120 --> 13:55.998
people-loving war hero
with a great deal to offer his party.

13:56.200 --> 13:58.350
- No.
- And his country.

13:58.560 --> 13:59.595
No.

13:59.800 --> 14:01.438
- No, what?
- No.

14:01.640 --> 14:03.119
I haven't even asked you
a question yet.

14:03.320 --> 14:04.992
No to the question
you're going to ask.

14:05.200 --> 14:07.156
No to all of the questions
you pretend to want to ask.

14:07.360 --> 14:08.429
Your hair is too flat.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.471
And no, you may not engage
in your usual backdoor

14:10.680 --> 14:11.590
And that tie...

14:11.800 --> 14:14.189
political thuggery to shovel me
onto the presidential ticket.

14:14.560 --> 14:17.518
Tie's wrong. Something less busy.

14:19.080 --> 14:21.150
Oh, you're not interested.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.193
Of course I'm interested.
I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.

14:24.400 --> 14:26.630
But not if it means attacking
the reputation

14:26.840 --> 14:28.432
of a statesman like Tom Jordan,

14:28.640 --> 14:30.995
which I am sure
was part of your plan.

14:31.200 --> 14:36.718
Excuse me, when have I ever
attacked Senator Jordan, despite...

14:37.560 --> 14:38.549
Despite what?

14:39.640 --> 14:41.551
Despite the shameful way
his daughter toyed with you

14:41.760 --> 14:43.876
that summer at the shore.

14:45.800 --> 14:48.109
You chased her away, Mother,
let's not have any illusions about...

14:48.320 --> 14:50.595
She wasn't in your league, but if that's
the way you choose to remember it...

14:50.800 --> 14:52.916
You destroyed any possibility
of us ever...

14:53.120 --> 14:56.430
Honey, you are oversimplifying things
a little bit, but it's okay.

14:56.720 --> 14:58.756
I'll stay out of it.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.194
You have my word.

15:03.280 --> 15:06.590
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

15:08.240 --> 15:11.789
<i>I think you all know my mother,</i>
<i>Senator Eleanor Prentiss Shaw.</i>

15:14.360 --> 15:17.238
<i>And some of you, no doubt,</i>
<i>remember my father,</i>

15:17.440 --> 15:20.273
<i>the late Senator John Shaw.</i>

15:22.680 --> 15:26.559
<i>I've been honored to serve</i>
<i>my two terms in Congress.</i>

15:26.760 --> 15:28.796
<i>But I also grew up on the Hill.</i>

15:29.000 --> 15:32.072
<i>I've seen how the game is played</i>
<i>by professionals,</i>

15:32.280 --> 15:33.952
<i>how deals are struck,</i>

15:34.160 --> 15:37.311
<i>committees bullied,</i>
<i>agendas bought and sold.</i>

15:37.520 --> 15:41.229
<i>And with apologies to my mother,</i>
<i>I wish to remain an amateur.</i>

15:42.800 --> 15:46.998
<i>I believe democracy</i>
<i>is not negotiable.</i>

15:49.200 --> 15:53.990
<i>I believe that freedom from fear</i>
<i>in the world at large and here at home</i>

15:54.200 --> 15:56.430
<i>is not negotiable.</i>

15:59.440 --> 16:03.194
<i>I know how much Americans</i>
<i>have to fear today.</i>

16:03.400 --> 16:05.834
<i>But I can tell you</i>
<i>that I've been there.</i>

16:06.640 --> 16:09.677
<i>I've faced the enemy firsthand</i>
<i>on the battlefront.</i>

16:10.640 --> 16:12.915
<i>I know what it is to be afraid.</i>

16:13.760 --> 16:16.991
<i>But I am living proof</i>
<i>that we can win.</i>

16:17.720 --> 16:20.075
<i>We can prevail.</i>

16:21.520 --> 16:27.197
<i>We must secure tomorrow today.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

16:34.320 --> 16:35.594
- Bluffing?
- That was the inference.

16:35.800 --> 16:37.836
They should be down on their fat,
white knees, thanking me

16:38.040 --> 16:40.235
for saving this party from
committing political seppuku.

16:40.440 --> 16:42.670
You gave them every opportunity
to do the right thing, senator.

16:42.880 --> 16:46.111
No. I gave them one opportunity and
that was unusually generous of me.

16:46.520 --> 16:47.953
See if you can get ahold of
Bob Arthur,

16:48.160 --> 16:49.752
because I'm gonna wanna
meet with him.

16:49.960 --> 16:51.473
Thank you very much
for arranging this.

16:51.680 --> 16:53.352
- I appreciate it.
- Sure.

16:55.440 --> 16:57.032
- Mr. Secretary.
- Senator.

16:57.240 --> 16:59.196
Thank you very much
for taking this meeting.

16:59.400 --> 17:02.597
- Good to see you again.
- Leona. So nice to see you, Leona.

17:02.800 --> 17:05.233
Buddy. Gentlemen.

17:06.280 --> 17:08.396
No, I thought we settled it
this morning.

17:08.599 --> 17:10.352
All right, I'll keep you posted.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.277
The decision is final.

17:16.480 --> 17:18.516
Thank you very much.

17:19.440 --> 17:22.000
- How's Jeanine?
- Senator.

17:23.560 --> 17:25.391
Tom Jordan's on the ticket.

17:25.599 --> 17:27.954
Now, we don't need your blessing,

17:28.160 --> 17:29.195
but we'd like it.

17:30.760 --> 17:34.196
Okay, so before we get started,
I'm just...

17:34.640 --> 17:36.756
I'm dying to know...

17:37.720 --> 17:43.158
...which genius hatched the idea of
pairing a sound bite from Nebraska

17:43.360 --> 17:46.636
with a relic who thinks that keeping
suicide bombers off our buses

17:46.840 --> 17:49.752
is unconstitutional.
Was it you, Gordy?

17:50.400 --> 17:53.278
All the research indicates
that an Arthur-Jordan ticket

17:53.480 --> 17:54.913
sits quite well
with the American people.

17:55.120 --> 17:57.554
"Sits quite well"
translates into how many votes?

17:57.760 --> 17:59.910
Your son is largely unknown
outside of New York.

18:00.160 --> 18:03.470
I mean, his public service,
his congressional record,

18:03.680 --> 18:05.318
while commendable,
is not the kind of thing...

18:05.520 --> 18:06.430
My son is a war hero.

18:06.640 --> 18:09.393
Governor Arthur has agreed
to consider Raymond

18:09.600 --> 18:11.318
for a cabinet-level post.

18:11.520 --> 18:12.919
We didn't come here
to have a discussion.

18:13.120 --> 18:14.439
Did we come here
to have a discussion?

18:14.640 --> 18:17.518
Ellie, you don't have the votes
to block this.

18:17.720 --> 18:20.029
Not even to push the nomination
to a second ballot.

18:20.240 --> 18:22.515
Oh, Jim, even running against
this cut-and-fold vice president,

18:22.720 --> 18:26.508
with his party's record of
abysmal failure at home and abroad,

18:26.720 --> 18:30.349
Governor Arthur is still unelectable
to the presidency...

18:30.560 --> 18:31.788
...without help.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.151
Consider, that our intrepid Arthur

18:35.640 --> 18:38.029
can hold on to his own home ground,
and the Northeast,

18:38.240 --> 18:41.152
and even California,
we are still dead across the South.

18:41.360 --> 18:43.078
He's not dead completely
in the South, senator...

18:43.280 --> 18:45.794
And the Southwest,
where they win by landslides.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.069
I mean, you know this.

18:47.280 --> 18:49.555
Your focus groups,
your polls all tell you this.

18:49.760 --> 18:51.113
They back me up, right?

18:51.320 --> 18:53.754
Now, you're counting on
Tom Jordan to help you get

18:53.960 --> 18:55.791
the black vote, women
and college kids.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.116
My gut instinct says he won't,

18:58.320 --> 19:03.394
and on Arthur to somehow hold
the centre, where he is soft at best.

19:03.600 --> 19:06.034
We're confident
this is a winning ticket, Ellie.

19:06.240 --> 19:08.629
What's your margin of error, Vaughn?

19:08.840 --> 19:10.478
Five points?

19:10.680 --> 19:12.159
Three?

19:12.360 --> 19:14.351
I can swing that, and you know it.

19:14.560 --> 19:16.915
Oh, I could swing seven
away from you.

19:17.120 --> 19:18.678
That's more than enough
to split the ticket.

19:18.880 --> 19:21.599
And deny us the White House
another four years? No.

19:21.800 --> 19:22.869
No, not even you.

19:23.080 --> 19:25.355
Not even you, senator,
will do that, you are bluffing.

19:25.560 --> 19:27.596
Oh, no, no, no, senator,
I would and I will

19:27.800 --> 19:31.315
and I will do whatever is necessary
to protect America

19:31.520 --> 19:34.080
from anyone who opposes her.

19:34.280 --> 19:36.999
I can't...
Am I the only person in this room

19:37.200 --> 19:38.838
who's been reading
these NSA reports?

19:39.040 --> 19:41.270
- I've read them.
- All right, then you know,

19:41.480 --> 19:44.438
you know we are on the brink
of another cataclysm,

19:44.640 --> 19:46.596
probably nuclear, on our own soil.

19:46.800 --> 19:47.949
Oh, Ellie, that's a bit extreme.

19:48.160 --> 19:49.798
And it's not from random terrorists,

19:50.000 --> 19:52.230
but from covert alliances
of disaffected nations

19:52.440 --> 19:56.433
who have all been made bold
by this kind of Jordan one-worlder

19:56.640 --> 19:58.995
who believes that human beings
are essentially good

19:59.200 --> 20:00.918
and that our power is somehow,
I don't know,

20:01.120 --> 20:03.680
shameful or evil or never to be used.

20:03.880 --> 20:06.348
Make no mistake,
the American people are terrified.

20:06.560 --> 20:08.869
They know something's coming.
They can feel it.

20:09.760 --> 20:13.070
And we can either shovel them
the same old shit and call it sugar

20:13.280 --> 20:15.396
or we can arm them.

20:15.600 --> 20:18.717
We can arm them with a young,
vibrant vice president.

20:18.920 --> 20:22.230
We can give them heat, energy,
give them a war hero with heart,

20:22.440 --> 20:25.637
forged by enemy fire
in the desert in the dark,

20:25.840 --> 20:28.877
when American lives
hung in the balance.

20:46.400 --> 20:48.118
Give us a few minutes.

20:49.560 --> 20:51.471
Thank you.

20:51.680 --> 20:53.875
Mr. Secretary,
thank you for your time.

20:54.320 --> 20:56.595
- Thank you.
- Really appreciate it.

20:57.760 --> 21:00.752
- Leona, good evening.
- Thank you, Ellie.

21:01.640 --> 21:03.790
Well, they're gonna have to make
their own decisions.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.753
<i>I am proud...</i>

21:07.360 --> 21:09.749
<i>... to offer into nomination</i>

21:09.960 --> 21:15.557
<i>the name of the next vice president</i>
<i>of these United States:</i>

21:15.760 --> 21:19.116
<i>Raymond Shaw!</i>

21:19.320 --> 21:20.992
<i>A remarkable development.</i>
<i>Twenty-four hours ago,</i>

21:21.200 --> 21:22.838
<i>New York Congressman</i>
<i>Raymond Prentiss Shaw</i>

21:23.040 --> 21:24.792
<i>wasn't even being mentioned</i>
<i>as a possible candidate</i>

21:25.000 --> 21:27.639
<i>for the vice presidential nomination</i>
<i>four years from now,</i>

21:27.840 --> 21:29.831
<i>much less this current convention.</i>

21:30.040 --> 21:32.918
<i>Some incredible news</i>
<i>from the convention floor tonight.</i>

21:33.120 --> 21:34.758
<i>Like a long shot</i>
<i>catching the favorite</i>

21:34.960 --> 21:36.757
<i>on the back stretch</i>
<i>of the Kentucky Derby,</i>

21:36.960 --> 21:39.394
<i>Raymond Shaw has overtaken</i>
<i>Senator Thomas Jordan</i>

21:39.600 --> 21:42.353
<i>to gain the vice presidential</i>
<i>nomination.</i>

21:42.560 --> 21:46.519
<i>Raymond Shaw bears the lineage</i>
<i>of the fabled Prentiss family dynasty.</i>

21:46.920 --> 21:51.118
<i>Grandson of legendary industrialist</i>
<i>and diplomat Tyler Prentiss,</i>

21:51.320 --> 21:54.392
<i>son of controversial</i>
<i>Senator Eleanor Prentiss Shaw,</i>

21:54.600 --> 21:56.875
<i>who took over the seat</i>
<i>vacated by her husband,</i>

21:57.080 --> 21:58.274
<i>the esteemed John Shaw,</i>

21:58.480 --> 22:02.029
<i>when he died tragically</i>
<i>over 20 years ago.</i>

22:02.840 --> 22:05.718
<i>For many, Raymond Prentiss Shaw</i>
<i>is an enigma.</i>

22:05.920 --> 22:07.751
<i>The millionaire</i>
<i>Harvard honors student</i>

22:07.960 --> 22:09.473
<i>who enlisted in the infantry,</i>

22:09.680 --> 22:13.116
<i>refusing the officer's commission</i>
<i>to which he was entitled.</i>

22:13.320 --> 22:14.992
<i>Media-shy and reclusive,</i>

22:15.200 --> 22:17.031
<i>Raymond Shaw's life</i>
<i>was forever changed</i>

22:17.240 --> 22:18.832
<i>on the killing fields of Kuwait,</i>

22:19.040 --> 22:22.828
<i>where he won the Congressional</i>
<i>Medal of Honor for combat bravery.</i>

22:23.040 --> 22:26.077
<i>Two members of Sergeant Shaw's</i>
<i>famed "Lost Patrol,"</i>

22:26.280 --> 22:28.589
<i>PFC Edward Ingram</i>

22:28.800 --> 22:31.792
<i>and PFC Robert Baker III,</i>
<i>were killed.</i>

22:32.000 --> 22:35.310
<i>Their guide, a civilian contractor,</i>
<i>disappeared in the ambush.</i>

22:36.280 --> 22:39.636
<i>But Sergeant Shaw</i>
<i>heroically fought off the enemy</i>

22:39.840 --> 22:41.956
<i>and guided the shell-shocked</i>
<i>survivors of the Lost Patrol</i>

22:42.160 --> 22:44.754
<i>across hostile terrain to safety.</i>

22:44.960 --> 22:48.873
<i>Raymond Shaw is probably</i>
<i>the kindest, bravest, warmest...</i>

22:49.080 --> 22:50.877
Most selfless human being
I've ever known.

22:51.080 --> 22:52.433
<i>The celebrated war hero,</i>

22:52.640 --> 22:56.235
<i>who dedicated himself to</i>
<i>public service after Desert Storm.</i>

22:56.440 --> 23:00.149
<i>The Medal of Honor winner, beloved</i>
<i>by the men of the Lost Patrol.</i>

23:00.520 --> 23:02.431
<i>He quickly turned his energies</i>
<i>to public service</i>

23:02.640 --> 23:04.392
<i>in his adopted state of New York.</i>

23:04.640 --> 23:07.074
<i>- The revolutionary science</i>
<i>of biogenetics,</i>

23:07.280 --> 23:10.033
<i>which has literally transformed...</i>

23:10.240 --> 23:12.196
<i>Captain Marco!</i>

23:15.600 --> 23:18.353
<i>The revolutionary science</i>
<i>of biogenetics.</i>

23:18.560 --> 23:21.393
The revolutionary science
of biogenetics,

23:21.600 --> 23:23.875
which has literally transformed...

23:27.200 --> 23:28.997
<i>- Captain Marco!</i>
- Raymond Shaw is the most selfless

23:29.200 --> 23:30.553
human being I've ever known.

23:30.760 --> 23:34.992
Raymond Shaw is probably
the kindest, bravest, warmest...

23:35.200 --> 23:38.476
Yet note the complexity
of the frontal lobe.

23:38.680 --> 23:40.910
<i>Nevertheless...</i>

23:41.120 --> 23:42.473
Captain.

23:44.400 --> 23:45.594
Help me.

23:47.360 --> 23:48.554
Sergeant Shaw.

23:48.760 --> 23:49.954
Captain.

23:50.160 --> 23:51.513
Suffocate Private Baker. Kill him.

23:51.720 --> 23:54.598
<i>Raymond Shaw is probably</i>
<i>the kindest, bravest, warmest,</i>

23:54.800 --> 23:59.271
<i>most selfless human being</i>
<i>I've ever known.</i>

24:03.520 --> 24:05.556
<i>Raymond Shaw...</i>

24:05.760 --> 24:09.878
Excellent, excellent.
Go on, Raymond.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.117
Good, good, Raymond.

24:13.120 --> 24:16.112
<i>Raymond Shaw is probably</i>
<i>the kindest, bravest,</i>

24:16.320 --> 24:18.754
<i>warmest, most selfless</i>
<i>human being I've ever known.</i>

24:39.600 --> 24:40.749
No offence, major...

24:41.760 --> 24:44.513
...but it sort of chaps my ass
that we have to have a babysitter.

24:44.720 --> 24:46.517
I'm just here to make sure
you don't get cornered

24:46.720 --> 24:48.438
by some Air Force general's
unhappy wife.

24:49.280 --> 24:51.555
Major Marco,
we should be so lucky.

24:51.800 --> 24:53.153
- So nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

24:53.360 --> 24:55.590
- Thank you.
- Nice to meet you.

24:55.800 --> 24:57.028
Raymond Shaw.

24:57.240 --> 24:58.878
Major Marco, this army of two

24:59.080 --> 25:00.957
are gonna do some recon
at the no-host bar.

25:01.160 --> 25:03.799
- A failed foreign policy which has
only served to galvanize our enemies.

25:04.360 --> 25:05.873
Excuse me, please.

25:06.080 --> 25:08.548
In fact, mobilizing an ersatz
army of malcontents...

25:08.760 --> 25:12.070
- General Sloan, you lead the charge.
- Absolutely.

25:12.280 --> 25:14.236
William. Hi, how are you?

25:14.440 --> 25:17.000
All right, good.
Have you met my wife, Pam?

25:17.200 --> 25:19.953
- Hello, how are you?
- Hello, Bob Arthur.

25:20.320 --> 25:24.393
I mean, isn't that supposed to be
the point of this great country of ours,

25:24.600 --> 25:26.318
that everybody matters.

25:26.520 --> 25:29.239
Not just the people at this party.

25:32.040 --> 25:35.919
But perhaps more importantly,
those who can't afford to be here.

25:36.120 --> 25:38.680
- Raymond. Sorry to interrupt.
- Excuse me.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.911
- Bob. You know my daughter.
- Tom, I can't believe it.

25:41.120 --> 25:44.510
Of course.
Jocelyn, good to see you again.

25:45.440 --> 25:47.510
- Mark.
- Eleanor.

25:47.720 --> 25:51.235
Raymond, your granddad would be
so goddamn proud of you.

25:51.440 --> 25:52.759
Thank you, Mr. Whiting.

25:52.960 --> 25:55.554
Raymond, this is J.B. Johnston,
from Manchurian Global.

25:55.760 --> 25:56.749
- Hi. How are you?
- Pleasure.

25:56.960 --> 25:58.473
And David Donovan,
their managing director.

25:58.680 --> 26:00.910
And co-chair of
the U.S. International Policy Caucus.

26:01.120 --> 26:02.189
Strong supporters, congressman.

26:03.200 --> 26:04.952
They're desperate to be
of service to you, darling.

26:05.160 --> 26:06.912
Thank you, Mother,
I think you've earned your fee.

26:07.120 --> 26:09.714
Oh, no. My plucky idealist.

26:10.720 --> 26:12.756
So, gentlemen, how's business?

26:12.960 --> 26:14.871
Not bad, Raymond.
Business is not bad.

26:15.080 --> 26:16.399
It could always be better.

26:16.600 --> 26:17.874
Any better and you guys
are gonna have

26:18.080 --> 26:19.479
more assets than
the European Union.

26:19.680 --> 26:20.669
Don't we already?

26:21.120 --> 26:24.669
Every great society,
every great civilization,

26:24.880 --> 26:26.836
always anchored by a great navy.

26:27.040 --> 26:28.598
- Congressman Shaw.
- Thanks very much.

26:28.800 --> 26:31.553
Nice to see you, Bob.
Thanks for coming.

26:32.600 --> 26:33.715
Congressman.

26:36.320 --> 26:38.038
Ben Marco.

26:38.240 --> 26:40.800
I know. Hello, captain.

26:41.480 --> 26:42.833
How you doing?

26:43.040 --> 26:45.713
- I need to talk to you.
- Okay.

26:46.040 --> 26:48.395
Oh, my God, Raymond,
it's been so many years.

26:48.600 --> 26:49.999
- And?
- And I've been married,

26:50.200 --> 26:51.315
- I've been divorced.
- Yeah.

26:51.520 --> 26:53.397
Well, you may have noticed
I've changed a bit myself.

26:53.600 --> 26:57.070
No. No, that's not...
No, yes, I have noticed.

26:57.280 --> 27:01.068
I see. It's great.
Congratulations.

27:01.280 --> 27:02.713
My feelings haven't, though.

27:05.160 --> 27:07.469
Changed, I mean.

27:09.120 --> 27:12.271
What feelings? What?

27:13.400 --> 27:15.630
Jocelyn, I have never
stopped wondering

27:15.840 --> 27:18.957
how things might have turned out
between us

27:19.160 --> 27:21.674
- if my mother hadn't...
- Raymond.

27:21.880 --> 27:24.269
Raymond, people can't just
rewrite their lives.

27:26.360 --> 27:28.999
I haven't had a relationship...

27:29.200 --> 27:31.475
...of any consequence
since we stopped seeing each other.

27:31.680 --> 27:34.035
Doesn't that say something to you?

27:34.840 --> 27:37.559
Yeah, that...

27:37.760 --> 27:41.196
That you must be just about
the loneliest person on this earth.

27:42.080 --> 27:45.550
Raymond, we were kids then. It must
have been, what, 15 years ago?

27:45.760 --> 27:46.829
It was sweet, but...

27:47.680 --> 27:48.999
Joce.

27:49.800 --> 27:52.268
Yeah. I have to go.

27:52.960 --> 27:55.474
- Yeah.
- Best of luck with the campaign.

27:56.160 --> 27:57.149
Thank you.

28:01.280 --> 28:02.679
Joce...

28:02.880 --> 28:05.314
Sergeant Raymond Shaw.

28:09.280 --> 28:11.316
I wanna talk to you too.

28:13.560 --> 28:14.709
- Not now.
- Excuse me, sir.

28:14.920 --> 28:16.353
I mean, I know you're busy,
congressman...

28:16.560 --> 28:18.357
- Don't touch me.
- I'm sorry.

28:18.560 --> 28:21.393
I'm sorry, it's just that, well...

28:21.600 --> 28:23.477
Don't ever touch me.

28:27.280 --> 28:29.840
Hello, major.
Have you tried the Pad Thai?

28:30.080 --> 28:32.594
I'm told it rules.

28:40.320 --> 28:42.276
<i>What were you hoping</i>
<i>Congressman Shaw would say?</i>

28:42.680 --> 28:44.318
I don't know, sir.

28:45.400 --> 28:49.359
It's not so much what he said
or didn't say, it was more of his...

28:49.560 --> 28:51.118
...attitude, his demeanor.

28:51.600 --> 28:52.794
Are you taking your meds?

28:53.000 --> 28:55.116
Lieutenant Colonel Howard,
with all due respect,

28:55.320 --> 28:57.197
I've had over a dozen years
of experts telling me

28:57.400 --> 29:00.039
that I have Gulf War Syndrome,
I have post-traumatic stress disorder

29:00.240 --> 29:03.312
and every other mood disorder
that you can name.

29:03.520 --> 29:06.796
In those 12 years,
I've been a good soldier.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.912
And I've denied what
every nerve ending in my body

29:10.120 --> 29:11.792
is telling me is more real than not.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.195
I've had one dream,
not variations on a dream,

29:14.400 --> 29:15.913
the same dream.
Night after night...

29:16.120 --> 29:19.032
No. No. I'm sorry.

29:19.240 --> 29:21.595
You're saying that an entire squad
of U.S. Army soldiers

29:21.800 --> 29:23.631
was hypnotized into believing
that Raymond Shaw

29:23.840 --> 29:25.353
deserved the Medal of Honor.

29:25.640 --> 29:28.154
And that somehow,
thanks to your dream,

29:28.360 --> 29:30.794
you're the only one
who knows the truth.

29:31.520 --> 29:34.432
Major Marco, you will stay clear
of Congressman Shaw.

29:39.760 --> 29:42.513
And you are to resume
your medication.

29:42.720 --> 29:44.517
That is an order.

29:44.720 --> 29:46.199
That will be all, major.

29:46.880 --> 29:49.758
<i>Somewhere right now, an</i>
<i>American soldier in the war on terror</i>

29:49.960 --> 29:52.190
<i>is worried about his</i>
<i>family back home.</i>

29:52.920 --> 29:55.832
<i>Somewhere right now,</i>
<i>in some small American town,</i>

29:56.040 --> 29:58.679
<i>his grandmother is standing</i>
<i>in her kitchen.</i>

29:58.880 --> 30:01.348
<i>She's got her medicine bottle</i>
<i>in one hand,</i>

30:01.560 --> 30:04.791
<i>she's opening the refrigerator</i>
<i>with the other and she's thinking:</i>

30:05.720 --> 30:07.915
<i>"I can pay for my medicine...</i>

30:08.920 --> 30:10.990
<i>... or I can pay for my dinner.</i>

30:11.880 --> 30:13.871
<i>I can't do both. "</i>

30:14.400 --> 30:16.118
<i>I don't believe that our mothers</i>
<i>and grandmothers</i>

30:16.320 --> 30:19.278
<i>should have to face that kind of</i>
<i>decision, not in this country.</i>

30:21.280 --> 30:24.272
<i>I don't believe that the brave men</i>
<i>and women of our armed forces,</i>

30:24.480 --> 30:26.948
<i>risking their lives overseas,</i>
<i>should have to worry</i>

30:27.720 --> 30:31.110
<i>about their families back here</i>
<i>in America.</i>

30:32.160 --> 30:34.276
<i>You see, there are some gaps</i>
<i>in this country...</i>

30:35.440 --> 30:38.193
<i>... deep chasms</i>
<i>that we need to bridge.</i>

30:39.960 --> 30:41.678
<i>The gap between rich and poor,</i>

30:42.040 --> 30:45.237
<i>between government</i>
<i>and the people,</i>

30:45.440 --> 30:48.671
<i>between true security</i>
<i>and the notion of feeling safe.</i>

30:48.880 --> 30:50.996
Second floor, room three,
end of hall.

30:51.480 --> 30:53.869
<i>Between what is real...</i>

30:54.080 --> 30:55.479
Don't you just love this guy?

30:55.680 --> 30:57.272
<i>And what is not.</i>

30:58.360 --> 31:00.920
<i>Tough choices are an unavoidable</i>
<i>element of leadership,</i>

31:01.120 --> 31:03.588
<i>I would just urge the governor</i>
<i>to remember that</i>

31:03.800 --> 31:07.190
<i>the primary responsibility</i>
<i>of government...</i>

31:28.800 --> 31:30.472
Al Melvin.

31:32.640 --> 31:35.200
Al, it's Ben Marco.
Are you in there?

31:40.240 --> 31:42.071
Fox is in the henhouse.

31:42.280 --> 31:43.952
Weasel.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.276
Weasel is...

31:49.840 --> 31:51.910
The weasel is a weasel.

31:53.520 --> 31:55.158
Sir, I'll be right outside.

31:55.880 --> 31:56.835
What?

31:57.520 --> 31:59.590
I'll be right outside, sir.

32:00.400 --> 32:01.719
I know.

32:02.400 --> 32:04.834
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.

32:06.040 --> 32:07.951
- Shall I get that for you, sir?
- No.

32:08.160 --> 32:10.196
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

32:31.840 --> 32:34.035
You have 30 seconds, Mother.

32:34.240 --> 32:35.559
Am I that predictable?

32:35.840 --> 32:37.671
You have no idea.

32:37.920 --> 32:40.514
I'm calling to compliment you,
Mr. Grumpy.

32:40.720 --> 32:43.553
I thought you were
magnificent tonight.

32:43.800 --> 32:46.598
And so did all the network
campaign experts.

32:47.120 --> 32:50.510
<i>And that compassionate</i>
<i>vigilance thing</i>

32:50.720 --> 32:53.359
<i>is working quite well for you.</i>

32:54.040 --> 32:56.918
- I might have to convert.
- I happen to believe in it.

32:57.120 --> 32:58.519
<i>Oh, yes, of course you do.</i>

32:58.720 --> 33:00.392
<i>- Now, Raymond...</i>
- Good night, Mother.

33:00.920 --> 33:03.150
<i>Raymond? What? No, wait, wait.</i>

33:04.720 --> 33:06.836
- Hang on a second.
<i>- What? Raymond?</i>

33:07.320 --> 33:08.514
Are you there?

33:11.080 --> 33:12.433
Yes?

33:12.800 --> 33:14.552
<i>Sergeant Shaw?</i>

33:14.960 --> 33:16.598
Who is this?

33:17.280 --> 33:20.272
<i>- Sergeant Raymond Shaw?</i>
- Yes.

33:20.600 --> 33:23.068
<i>Raymond Prentiss Shaw?</i>

33:28.120 --> 33:29.553
Yes.

33:29.840 --> 33:31.114
<i>Listen.</i>

33:31.680 --> 33:33.716
<i>Go to the bedroom of your suite.</i>

33:34.320 --> 33:36.914
<i>Enter the hallway there.</i>

33:37.120 --> 33:40.556
<i>Go to the end and open the closet.</i>

34:08.639 --> 34:10.755
Yes, thank you.

34:13.280 --> 34:15.748
- Hello, Raymond.
- Hello.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.752
Do you remember me?

34:22.280 --> 34:23.679
No, sir, I don't.

34:23.960 --> 34:26.393
Brilliant. We've got 20 minutes
for our little checkup

34:26.600 --> 34:29.319
from the neck up, gentlemen,
so if we could take his jacket.

34:29.520 --> 34:30.953
Please sit down.

34:34.239 --> 34:36.754
No, Mr. Villalobos, I'm just...
The Army's got me gathering

34:36.960 --> 34:39.757
information on stress disorders,
so I'm just...

34:40.000 --> 34:43.231
...you know, just running statistics,
trying to find out about my old team...

34:46.920 --> 34:48.831
Well, listen. Mr. Wilson,

34:49.080 --> 34:53.391
when Nathan came home,
was he preoccupied with Kuwait?

34:53.600 --> 34:55.158
I mean, did he have nightmares
or bad dreams

34:55.360 --> 34:56.998
about the firefight over there?

35:01.600 --> 35:06.037
You'll feel a little cold
as this anesthetic gel goes on.

35:10.840 --> 35:12.990
Probe sheath...

35:13.200 --> 35:15.919
...and probe.

35:19.360 --> 35:21.715
Please relax.
Are you relaxed, Raymond?

35:21.920 --> 35:22.989
Yes, sir.

35:23.240 --> 35:27.791
Now, Raymond, I am going to drill
a tiny hole in the skull,

35:28.000 --> 35:31.709
which will allow delivery
of the new implant.

35:32.320 --> 35:35.232
So, what you'll feel is a little
discomfort in the form of pressure

35:35.440 --> 35:37.715
and also a loud vibrating noise
in your head,

35:37.920 --> 35:41.708
all of which, of course,
is completely normal.

37:38.880 --> 37:40.108
<i>Thank you.</i>

37:42.720 --> 37:45.393
Of course, as soon as this
or any task is completed,

37:45.600 --> 37:50.310
you will already have forgotten
that it ever actually took place.

37:51.200 --> 37:53.077
Probe going in now.

38:02.560 --> 38:03.788
Good.

38:05.520 --> 38:07.238
Excellent.

38:07.440 --> 38:09.749
Releasing implant.

38:09.960 --> 38:12.349
There. That wasn't so bad,
was it, Raymond?

38:12.560 --> 38:13.788
No, sir.

38:14.440 --> 38:16.635
That's good. No decay, no slippage.

38:16.840 --> 38:20.879
Everything seems to be
in flawless working condition.

38:45.680 --> 38:47.511
Now, Raymond.

38:47.760 --> 38:51.150
Can you remember the deaths
of Private Baker and Private Ingram?

38:51.360 --> 38:52.315
Yes, sir.

38:52.560 --> 38:54.949
Good. Can you describe them
for me, please?

38:55.160 --> 38:58.072
<i>We're on a routine recon</i>
<i>inside Iraqi-controlled terrain,</i>

38:58.280 --> 39:00.669
<i>assessing troop strength.</i>

39:02.080 --> 39:06.232
"We're on a routine recon
inside Iraqi-controlled terrain,

39:06.440 --> 39:07.759
assessing troop strength."

39:07.960 --> 39:10.474
The mission ends without incident.
We're heading back...

39:10.680 --> 39:13.319
"Toward the command.
The night is clear. Stars..."

39:13.560 --> 39:16.757
The night is clear.
Stars, but no moon.

39:17.320 --> 39:18.514
<i>The patrol is ambushed.</i>

39:18.720 --> 39:21.837
<i>We're engaged unexpectedly by</i>
<i>ground forces with helicopter support.</i>

39:22.040 --> 39:24.759
<i>RPG incoming, mortar fire.</i>

39:25.080 --> 39:26.559
"Captain..."

39:28.120 --> 39:30.350
Captain Marco
is knocked unconscious.

39:30.560 --> 39:34.314
In the ensuing firefight, Eddie Ingram
gets himself separated to the left.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.076
<i>Baker goes after him.</i>

39:37.280 --> 39:39.316
<i>An incoming mortar shell</i>
<i>kills them both instantly</i>

39:39.520 --> 39:42.796
<i>before I am able to locate and</i>
<i>eliminate the source of the ordnance.</i>

39:44.560 --> 39:47.791
<i>Captain. Captain Marco.</i>

39:48.000 --> 39:49.353
<i>Help me.</i>

39:56.760 --> 39:59.479
Pardon me. Is this seat taken?

40:00.080 --> 40:03.470
I see the captain enjoys
the road less traveled.

40:20.240 --> 40:22.196
Paper or plastic?

40:24.160 --> 40:27.277
Oh, come on.
From the grocery store.

40:27.480 --> 40:30.358
You know, at the checkout stand.
Paper or plastic girl, that's me.

40:30.560 --> 40:31.959
"Paper or plastic, sir?"

40:33.560 --> 40:34.913
I see you there all the time.

40:35.120 --> 40:37.509
Bennett Marco.
Checks from First National Bank.

40:37.720 --> 40:42.316
Romance novels, instant noodles,
NoDoz and tomatoes.

40:46.240 --> 40:48.913
So anyway, I'm on vacation.

40:49.120 --> 40:51.190
Holiday in the Big Apple
and all of that.

40:51.400 --> 40:53.709
And I saw you sitting here
and I said, "Hey,

40:53.920 --> 40:56.673
why not reach out
and touch someone?"

41:00.320 --> 41:03.118
So, what, I suppose
you're heading to New York City.

41:03.320 --> 41:05.356
Yeah, yeah, I'm... Yeah.

41:05.960 --> 41:08.269
Business? Pleasure? Both?

41:08.600 --> 41:13.390
Well, I'm just... I got an old friend
up there, an old Army friend that...

41:14.320 --> 41:17.073
Well, he's in politics now
and I'm just gonna

41:17.280 --> 41:19.510
catch up on old times with him.

41:23.320 --> 41:24.833
I'm sorry, you said your name was?

41:25.720 --> 41:27.073
Eugenie.

41:28.040 --> 41:29.553
What do your friends call you?

41:29.760 --> 41:31.796
My friends, they call me Rosie.

41:32.240 --> 41:34.151
- Rosie?
- Yeah, see, my full name is

41:34.360 --> 41:35.839
Eugenie Rose.
I like the Rosie part better.

41:36.040 --> 41:38.679
Eugenie is, well...

41:39.200 --> 41:40.679
...fragile.

41:41.040 --> 41:44.112
Yeah, but still, when I asked you
your name, you didn't say...

41:44.560 --> 41:46.357
What did you say?
You said Eugenie.

41:46.560 --> 41:48.630
Yeah, well...

41:49.200 --> 41:53.716
...maybe I was feeling fragile
at the time.

42:02.640 --> 42:04.039
Are you okay?

42:04.240 --> 42:05.514
Excuse me.

42:51.680 --> 42:53.033
Hello, captain.

42:53.760 --> 42:55.113
Do you remember me?

43:26.040 --> 43:27.314
Ben.

43:28.160 --> 43:31.470
Hey. I'm gonna get a cab.
You want me to drop you somewhere?

43:31.680 --> 43:32.829
No, I'm okay.

43:33.040 --> 43:34.758
Okay. So your friend's
gonna meet you here, then?

43:34.960 --> 43:36.279
No.

43:37.760 --> 43:39.113
All right.

43:39.320 --> 43:42.198
El Dorado 5-9970.

43:44.520 --> 43:48.149
It's my cell phone number,
in case you ever... You know.

43:48.360 --> 43:50.271
I like to say it the old-fashioned way.

43:50.480 --> 43:53.711
Can you remember or should I write it
on your chest with a Sharpie?

43:54.560 --> 43:56.676
- I'll remember.
- Okay.

43:57.360 --> 43:59.590
Hey, you're kind of...

44:00.240 --> 44:02.629
You need somewhere to go
to freshen up?

44:04.360 --> 44:05.952
<i>Pentagon watchdogs</i>
<i>today accused</i>

44:06.160 --> 44:08.435

- No.

44:49.960 --> 44:53.032
Believe it or not, there's a view.

44:53.240 --> 44:56.198
Go to the fire escape
and tilt your head up,

44:56.440 --> 44:58.510
you can almost see a tree.

45:00.600 --> 45:02.795
- Can I get you something to drink?
- No, I'm fine.

45:05.320 --> 45:07.959

It's great for your metabolism,
if you're into that.

45:11.840 --> 45:16.595
Or some tomato juice. No? All right.

45:17.280 --> 45:18.838
Or...

45:19.040 --> 45:20.109
...some water?

45:20.560 --> 45:22.596
- No, thank you.
- I'm sorry.

45:23.680 --> 45:26.035
I'm nervous.
I yak when I get nervous.

45:27.120 --> 45:28.792
Where is she, your cousin?

45:30.080 --> 45:31.957
She's on tour with <i>Dreamgirls</i>.

45:42.800 --> 45:43.949
Hey, are you okay?

45:46.480 --> 45:47.799
Yeah.

45:50.480 --> 45:53.392
Look, I'm sorry about
what happened earlier.

45:53.600 --> 45:56.034
You don't have to apologize to me.

45:57.040 --> 45:59.110
I'll make you some tea.

46:36.560 --> 46:39.916
Jesus. Where's the lemon? Okay.

46:40.600 --> 46:44.115
- You okay in there?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

46:44.720 --> 46:47.871
You know, I left you some towels
in there, did you see them?

46:51.680 --> 46:53.716
- What was that?
- Dropped my bag.

47:01.040 --> 47:02.439
Ben?

47:03.680 --> 47:05.398
Are you okay in there?

47:05.840 --> 47:07.114
Earth to Ben.

47:07.840 --> 47:09.114
Yeah.

47:09.400 --> 47:12.437
- You sure everything's all right?
- Yes.

47:15.200 --> 47:16.679
Ben?

47:25.720 --> 47:27.278
Ben?

47:27.960 --> 47:29.632
Ben?

47:30.520 --> 47:31.635
Ben.

47:36.000 --> 47:37.319
Ben?

47:59.960 --> 48:01.234
What are you doing?

48:05.440 --> 48:07.078
Did you see that?

48:10.720 --> 48:12.756
What I had in my hand.

48:16.680 --> 48:19.399
<i>I wasn't hallucinating, Delp.</i>
<i>I held it in my hand.</i>

48:19.600 --> 48:21.875
That's what they all say, Marco.

48:22.080 --> 48:25.038
Some wicked shit got sprayed
on you guys during Desert Storm.

48:25.600 --> 48:28.592
Besides all the depleted uranium,
I mean.

48:29.240 --> 48:31.196
I personally know of
a couple of Rangers

48:31.400 --> 48:34.039
who swear that they see only
in tertiary colors now,

48:34.240 --> 48:37.198
- Delp.
- And can pick up sports talk radio

48:37.400 --> 48:40.710
in their cortical block if they get
too close to a Con-Ed transformer.

48:41.120 --> 48:42.917
It's not Gulf War Syndrome.

48:49.480 --> 48:55.350
The Army did try this
tiny, implantable ID thing.

48:57.120 --> 49:00.032
You could imbed it under the skin,
then scan it like a bar code

49:00.240 --> 49:02.754
for medical emergency information:

49:03.200 --> 49:05.316
Blood type, DNA.

49:05.520 --> 49:07.476
Well, the Army never put one in me.

49:11.160 --> 49:13.310
That you know of, man.

49:15.720 --> 49:17.392
That you know of.

49:27.680 --> 49:30.831
<i>U.S. Planes bombed selected sites</i>
<i>in Guinea today, acting on intelligence</i>

49:31.040 --> 49:34.237
<i>that the African nation's military</i>
<i>regime had secretly resumed</i>

49:34.440 --> 49:35.998
<i>its chemical weapons program.</i>

49:36.200 --> 49:38.316
<i>The secretary of defense declined</i>
<i>to comment on the attack,</i>

49:38.520 --> 49:40.317
<i>saying only that the mission</i>
<i>was successful,</i>

49:40.520 --> 49:43.432
<i>targets acquired, that all American</i>
<i>personnel involved here</i>

49:43.640 --> 49:46.916
<i>- were home safe and sound.</i>
<i>- Striking transportation workers...</i>

49:48.080 --> 49:52.278
My dreams seem more real to me

49:52.480 --> 49:55.756
than what I actually remember
happening over there. It's like...

49:57.920 --> 50:03.119
It's like somewhere along the line
I got brainwashed or something and...

50:05.400 --> 50:08.039
I'm just, like, all scrambled up.

50:09.160 --> 50:11.116
We have all been
brainwashed, Marco.

50:12.280 --> 50:15.477
As for somebody
imbedding electric probes

50:15.680 --> 50:20.071
and computer chips in your brain
to make you do things,

50:20.320 --> 50:22.038
it's horseshit, man.

50:24.680 --> 50:26.033
A little electroshock...

50:26.960 --> 50:30.350
...and sleep deprivation will do
the trick for a fraction of the price.

50:30.560 --> 50:32.471
Ask the Uzbeks.

50:33.640 --> 50:35.517
What about my dreams?

50:36.800 --> 50:39.872
What if all this is your dream...

50:40.960 --> 50:43.758
...and you are really
still back in Kuwait?

51:06.720 --> 51:09.712
- Thanks for coming out. Thank you.
- Congressman!

51:09.920 --> 51:11.433
- Congressman!
- Congressman!

51:11.640 --> 51:14.200
Congressman! Congressman!
Why do you and Governor Arthur

51:14.400 --> 51:16.118
oppose deploying troops
into Indonesia?

51:16.320 --> 51:17.719
Well, Governor Arthur and I believe

51:17.920 --> 51:19.558
we can't clean up the world
with dirty hands.

51:19.760 --> 51:21.352
Sergeant Shaw!

51:23.040 --> 51:24.678
Do you ever dream about Kuwait?

51:25.000 --> 51:26.718
Captain Marco.

51:28.560 --> 51:30.232
It's okay. It's okay.

51:30.440 --> 51:31.873
Nice to see you, sir.

51:32.120 --> 51:34.395
Good evening.
It's good to see you too.

51:34.720 --> 51:36.119
Why did you ask me about Kuwait?

51:36.320 --> 51:37.719
I didn't.
I asked you about your dreams.

51:37.920 --> 51:39.148
- Thank you, Lily.
- Congressman Shaw, I'm sorry.

51:39.360 --> 51:41.635
They wanna know if you can do
an interview with Larry King at 6?

51:41.840 --> 51:43.319
- No, no.
- No to the interview or no to 6?

51:43.520 --> 51:44.953
No. He wants to talk
about my mother. No.

51:45.160 --> 51:46.912
- Everything under control, P. J?
- Hello, sir.

51:47.160 --> 51:48.752
Good to see you.

51:49.000 --> 51:50.877
So, captain, what can I do for you?

51:51.080 --> 51:52.433
I just need a few minutes
of your time.

51:52.640 --> 51:53.868
Congressman Shaw,
a moment, please?

51:54.080 --> 51:54.990
Private time.

51:55.200 --> 51:57.760
Unfortunately, this is as private
as it gets for me now.

51:57.960 --> 51:59.439
- I understand.
- He's all right, Will.

51:59.640 --> 52:01.551
- Come on in.
- Thank you, thank you.

52:03.040 --> 52:05.600
- Hey, George.
- There are these dreams

52:05.800 --> 52:08.439
that some of the men
from our unit have been having.

52:08.640 --> 52:09.914
Including you?

52:10.120 --> 52:11.348
Well...

52:11.960 --> 52:14.872
...it's more of a question
of what actually happened

52:15.080 --> 52:17.036
the night that our patrol
got attacked.

52:17.560 --> 52:21.633
That's easy. We're on a routine recon
inside Iraqi-controlled terrain.

52:21.840 --> 52:24.354
The patrol is ambushed.
RPG incoming, mortar fire.

52:24.560 --> 52:26.676
- You're knocked...
- Unconscious. Exactly the way...

52:26.880 --> 52:29.713
Not to cut you off, but I mean,
exactly the way that I remember it.

52:29.920 --> 52:32.593
But I dreamed something else.

52:34.160 --> 52:35.593
Am I in your dreams, captain?

52:36.480 --> 52:38.038
Yes, you are, congressman.

52:38.360 --> 52:39.429
Saving everybody?

52:39.640 --> 52:42.518
It's a whole lot more complicated
than that. Now, Corporal Melvin,

52:42.720 --> 52:45.075
he's been drawing these pictures
and he wrote down what he dreams.

52:45.280 --> 52:47.111
- Maybe if you just...
- I don't have dreams, captain.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.798
At all? You don't dream at all?
Everybody dreams, right? I mean...

52:51.000 --> 52:53.230
Look, captain, I'd like to help you,
I would, I really would,

52:53.440 --> 52:55.158
but I think you ought to
see somebody.

52:55.360 --> 52:57.316
- Somebody who specializes in...
- I've been to doctors.

52:57.800 --> 52:59.313
Well, good, that's very good,

52:59.520 --> 53:01.988
because they can probably
help you out a lot more than I can.

53:02.240 --> 53:03.798
- I don't know, but...
- Take care, captain.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.468
- Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
- Thanks for coming by.

53:12.680 --> 53:14.352
I'm not crazy, Shaw.

53:18.400 --> 53:19.879
Major.

53:22.000 --> 53:25.709
- Ben. Are you hungry?
- Starving.

53:31.160 --> 53:32.479
Well, it depends on the demographic.

53:32.720 --> 53:33.948
Excuse me.

53:35.400 --> 53:37.231
- I killed Baker?
- Well, it's a dream.

53:37.440 --> 53:39.476
I mean, it could mean
something else.

53:39.960 --> 53:42.190
It could mean I'm supposed
to think you did.

53:42.400 --> 53:46.075
No, I killed the enemy.
I didn't know them either, so...

53:46.440 --> 53:48.032
...it was okay.

53:48.760 --> 53:51.558
And anyway, I remember what we did
in Kuwait. I remember it perfectly.

53:51.760 --> 53:52.909
I just...

53:53.440 --> 53:55.749
...don't remember actually doing it.

53:56.480 --> 53:58.072
Maybe you didn't do it.

54:04.800 --> 54:06.233
No.

54:07.200 --> 54:08.713
What a thought.

54:26.080 --> 54:27.479
What?

54:32.080 --> 54:34.036
Life is so bizarre, isn't it?

54:35.040 --> 54:36.598
Which part?

54:36.800 --> 54:39.155
I don't know.
What you saw downstairs.

54:39.600 --> 54:45.277
This campaign. Politics.
My whole public life and persona.

54:46.760 --> 54:50.389
I mean, posing and grinning
like a goddamn sock puppet,

54:50.600 --> 54:53.160
shaking hands with total strangers
who must be completely blind

54:53.360 --> 54:55.635
if they can't see
what I am at the core.

54:55.840 --> 54:58.673
What my mother has made me.
A Prentiss.

54:58.880 --> 55:01.030
Ferociously a Prentiss.

55:01.600 --> 55:04.751
- But not a Shaw. No, sir.
- I see.

55:05.280 --> 55:06.793
No, you don't.

55:07.720 --> 55:08.869
You can't.

55:11.240 --> 55:13.117
I was 20 years old
before I had a friend.

55:13.320 --> 55:19.077
Worse, a girlfriend. Well, you know,
from my point of view, anyway.

55:19.440 --> 55:23.149
A friend outside of my mother's circle
of approved encounters

55:23.360 --> 55:25.396
and she...

55:27.680 --> 55:29.318
...my mother...

55:32.280 --> 55:36.558
God only knows what she told
Jocelyn to chase her away.

55:37.080 --> 55:39.594
Precipitating my sole act
of rebellion:

55:39.800 --> 55:41.552
Storming off...

55:42.320 --> 55:44.709
...and enlisting in the Army.

55:48.000 --> 55:49.353
But after the war...

55:51.280 --> 55:53.396
...I came back to her.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.070
Why did you come back?
What happened?

56:01.520 --> 56:03.238
Weren't you listening?

56:03.920 --> 56:05.797
Mother happened.

56:06.960 --> 56:09.076
You know, the truth is I hate it.

56:09.520 --> 56:11.715
I've always despised the Medal.

56:12.320 --> 56:15.517
The cloying adulation
of the little people.

56:16.480 --> 56:18.675
It's certainly...

56:18.920 --> 56:21.388
...nothing for you
to be jealous of, major.

56:21.600 --> 56:22.919
I'm not jealous.

56:23.840 --> 56:25.558
I don't have the dreams, Ben.

56:26.040 --> 56:30.192
How could you not remember
saving our unit?

56:30.760 --> 56:32.113
I do. I said I did.

56:32.320 --> 56:35.756
No, no, you didn't. You said
that you didn't remember doing it.

56:35.960 --> 56:38.190
That's what you just said
a couple minutes ago.

56:39.840 --> 56:41.956
When I think about that night...

56:43.520 --> 56:46.034
...it's as if I know what will happen.

56:47.240 --> 56:48.878
The thing is, I never seem
to get to the point

56:49.080 --> 56:52.152
where I feel that it actually
does happen.

56:52.360 --> 56:54.112
But I'm sure that's perfectly normal.

56:54.400 --> 56:57.870
Okay. Well, have you discussed this
with anyone? These discrepancies?

56:58.240 --> 57:00.310
Who would I share that with?

57:01.040 --> 57:03.315
My old Army buddies
who love and adore me

57:03.520 --> 57:05.556
for saving their
pathetically unimportant,

57:05.760 --> 57:08.115
present company excluded, asses?

57:08.560 --> 57:10.516
You could discuss it
with Army intelligence.

57:10.720 --> 57:13.996
You could go down there.
I mean, I could go with you

57:14.200 --> 57:16.270
and discuss it and you can tell them
what you remember,

57:16.480 --> 57:19.313
what you don't remember,
and they could...

57:20.040 --> 57:21.712
...run some tests.

57:24.360 --> 57:26.669
Yeah, tests. Boy.

57:26.880 --> 57:28.791
The press would have
a field day with that.

57:29.440 --> 57:32.034
Somebody put an implant inside me.
I found it this morning.

57:32.240 --> 57:34.356
I've got the hole in my back
if you wanna take a look at it.

57:34.560 --> 57:37.028
And I got a good feeling
they put one in you too.

57:42.840 --> 57:44.432
Nobody has put anything
in me, Ben.

57:44.640 --> 57:46.676
Let's prove it.
Why don't, you know...

57:46.880 --> 57:48.393
- We'll go get an x-ray...
- Look, Ben,

57:48.600 --> 57:50.318
I wanna be supportive of you. I do.

57:50.520 --> 57:52.988
But don't you think this could wait
till after the election?

57:53.200 --> 57:54.315
Why? For what?

57:54.520 --> 57:56.476
- What are you scared of?
- I'm not afraid of anything.

57:56.680 --> 57:59.319
- Then why don't we just prove it...
- Know what? I think you should leave.

57:59.520 --> 58:01.988
- I'm sorry, I really...
- Listen.

58:02.200 --> 58:06.796
Somebody got into our heads
with big steel-toe boots,

58:07.000 --> 58:09.355
cable cutters and a chainsaw
and they went to town.

58:09.560 --> 58:12.870
Neurons got... Got...
Got exposed and circuits got rewired.

58:13.080 --> 58:15.674
Our brain cells got
obliterated, Raymond.

58:15.880 --> 58:17.393
Please.

58:18.240 --> 58:20.117
You need to get help, Ben.

58:20.920 --> 58:23.036
What are you doing? Ben!

58:27.120 --> 58:28.758
Stop! Stop!

58:29.040 --> 58:30.189
Inside! Inside!

58:35.960 --> 58:36.915
Congressman!

58:42.560 --> 58:44.278
He bit him. He bit him.

58:48.560 --> 58:50.152
Get him out of here.

58:57.560 --> 58:59.073
Are you okay, sir?

59:01.600 --> 59:02.953
- Leave me alone.
- Sir, we should...

59:03.160 --> 59:04.639
Get out!

59:37.520 --> 59:39.158
We fished him out of
the Potomac River

59:39.360 --> 59:42.158
about 4:45 yesterday afternoon.

59:43.200 --> 59:45.953
What were you doing
in Al Melvin's apartment?

59:47.080 --> 59:48.559
I went to talk to him.
He wasn't home.

59:48.760 --> 59:51.638
Talk about what? Dreams?

59:54.440 --> 59:55.873
Interesting stuff.

59:56.080 --> 59:58.992
Yeah, there's hundreds
of those in his place.

59:59.200 --> 01:00:00.394
You should have your people
check it out.

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:01.999
Oh, we'll get on that right away.

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:05.397
Colonel Garret was kind enough
to show us the file on you, Marco.

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:08.751
You are the real deal, aren't you?

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:12.872
Special Forces. Rangers. Delta.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:16.472
I wanted to talk to Corporal Melvin

01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:20.389
to ask him some
unanswered questions about...

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:23.160
...our reconnaissance
in Kuwait back in '91.

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:25.112
- He wasn't home.
- Right. He wasn't there.

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:28.710
So, what, you thought it was okay
to just break in and wait for him?

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:30.319
I didn't kill him,
if that's where you're headed.

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:32.112
Nobody said you did.

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:33.719
Maybe he committed suicide.

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.438
What's your obsession
with Raymond Shaw?

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:39.153
I'm not obsessed
with Raymond Shaw.

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:40.918
The man of his dreams.

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:44.118
You may want to ask
your medical examiners

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:46.117
to check Melvin's back.

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:47.912
It's under the skin
just shy of the scapula.

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:50.839
They may find a implant.

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.598
Just under the skin, left side.

01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:54.950
If they don't look real hard,
they won't find it.

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:57.710
They could sing that while
they're looking for it if they like.

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.672
- Implants.
- That's what I said.

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:01.472
I-M-plant.

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:06.196
Yeah, but judging from
your file here, apparently,

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.709
you don't know your shit
from your oatmeal, my friend.

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:10.478
Excuse me. This is unnecessary.

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:12.599
You got a problem?

01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:16.757
Psycho? You look a little angry.

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:20.593
Maybe you wanna hit me?
Go ahead, you can do it.

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:24.280
- Hey!
- For God's sake, Ben...

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:26.869
He hit me.

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:29.758
And you wanna help him?

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:33.430
No. That would be political suicide.
Of course not.

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:35.797
I want you to help him.

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:41.437
I can't even imagine why.

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:45.197
Mother, I can assure you, I am as
uncomfortable asking you to do this

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:47.470
as you are being asked.

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:50.268
My campaign people are getting
a restraining order against him.

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:53.552
He's going on every security watch list,
but I won't lock him up.

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:56.320
- I'm not pressing charges.
- What?

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:58.590
I don't know, it's just...

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:03.393
I don't wanna talk
about this right now.

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:05.318
Can we get back to the campaign
and focus on something...

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:08.751
Raymond, you don't actually
believe his story?

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:12.312
No.

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:14.831
But he does.

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:18.675
And he's a fine soldier.

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:22.274
And if his slim hold
on sanity requires

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:24.835
that I tolerate his delusions
until he can get help, I'll do it.

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:26.598
It doesn't diminish me.

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:29.031
I'm not afraid of him.

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:31.553
Raymond.

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:42.356
How much do you actually know
about your friend?

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:14.391
Oh, that's sad.

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:16.431
Poor little tin soldier.

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:18.232
Mother, please.

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:20.908
Well, just imagine how terrified
your people were yesterday

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:23.350
when Major Marco showed up
at campaign headquarters

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.073
and you invite...

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:27.316
My God, you invited him in.

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:29.319
With all they know about him.

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:32.111
I know him.

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:34.597
I served under him.
He was a good man.

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:37.872
Well, that's what the neighbors
always say about serial killers.

01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:49.159
You're out of here.
Shaw won't press charges.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.116
Someone from
Senator Eleanor Shaw's office called

01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:57.390
and intervened on your behalf.

01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:00.034
Major, you've reached the terminal end
of the Army's patience.

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:02.754
You're relieved of duty,
effective immediately.

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:06.598
Yes, sir.

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:08.074
Ben,

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:11.352
there is a young neurologist
at Walter Reed. His name is Zahn.

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:13.710
He's had real success
with Gulf War Syndrome.

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:15.797
You are instructed to get
your affairs in order

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.956
and report to him
first thing Monday morning.

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:44.752
I thought you said you lost it.

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.473
I bit a guy. I found another one.

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:51.873
These are not supposed to exist.

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:01.189
These are only theoretical.

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:07.559
So, what does it do?

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:09.990
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.718
I don't know.

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:18.838
I don't wanna know.
You don't wanna know.

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:21.679
Look, it's out of you
and you are still alive.

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:23.916
That's the good news.

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:25.879
What's the bad news?

01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:30.111
Maybe they know you're here.

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:51.152
You said the Army implants,
they were for

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:53.669
emergency medical data, right?

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:56.440
The ones they publicized were.

01:05:57.160 --> 01:06:02.188
There was a parallel project
for all kinds of scary implantables.

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:05.790
The Clinton watchdogs finally
freaked out about it, closed down.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.991
Parallel project?

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:09.394
How did you know about that?

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:14.196
Manchurian Global funded me
to make some of their scary shit.

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:16.038
Heard of them?

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:18.996
Imagine not just
a corporation, Marco,

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:22.670
but a goddamn geopolitical
extension of policy

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:24.996
for every president since Nixon.

01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:26.838
Cash is king, Marco.

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:29.031
Cash is king.

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:42.076
You sure you wanna do this?

01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:43.952
Absolutely.

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:47.752
Because I don't.

01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:49.234
I'll owe you one.

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:51.078
No.

01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:52.998
I still owe you.

01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:56.275
For getting me out of Albania.

01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:57.708
Albania.

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:04.115
What are you doing?

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:05.992
In case I forget things
I wanna remember.

01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:15.635
I'm putting you on a cocktail
of methohexitol to take the edge off.

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:17.239
The edge off of what?

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:21.035
Getting clarity.
Or whatever you wanna call it.

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:25.833
ECT not being
the precise science that, say,

01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:27.917
leeching is.

01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:30.315
You don't think
this is gonna work?

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:33.554
It's a desperation move, man.

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:36.395
But, hey, there is a school
of thought that says

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:38.830
a victim of induced abreaction...

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:40.917
Here it comes.

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:13.077
<i>The night is clear.</i>
<i>Stars, but no moon.</i>

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:14.429
<i>The patrol is ambushed.</i>

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:17.916
<i>We were on a routine recon</i>
<i>inside Iraqi-controlled terrain,</i>

01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:19.951
<i>assessing troop strength...</i>

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:21.957
<i>Captain Marco was</i>
<i>knocked unconscious.</i>

01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:24.957
<i>In the ensuing firefight, Eddie Ingram</i>
<i>gets himself separated to the left.</i>

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:26.309
<i>Baker goes after him.</i>

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:27.635
Hello, captain.

01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:30.835
Before Sergeant Shaw
is able to locate...

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:33.076
Eddie Ingram gets himself
separated to the left.

01:09:11.359 --> 01:09:13.430
Did you go blank on me again?

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:20.911
He said this would happen.

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:23.798
Who?

01:09:24.479 --> 01:09:27.118
Your German friend.
Your friend.

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:30.033
Ben.

01:09:32.479 --> 01:09:36.109
He said it'd be like
a computer system crash.

01:09:36.319 --> 01:09:39.153
That your brain would shut down,
but it would reboot again

01:09:39.359 --> 01:09:41.510
and you'd forget all your RAM.

01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:43.631
Or most of your RAM.

01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:52.234
Do you remember me?

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:57.870
Do you remember me?

01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:00.512
Ben?

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:03.957
Eugenie.

01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:10.317
How did I get here?

01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:12.672
You called me.

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:15.033
Where am I?

01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:16.798
<i>- Planning a suicide bombing.</i>

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.878
<i>The Mile High City has suffered</i>
<i>a series of brutal attacks</i>

01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:21.433
<i>during the past several months.</i>

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:25.679
<i>Senator Eleanor Prentiss Shaw,</i>
<i>does it bother you at all</i>

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:29.714
<i>that your son repudiates</i>
<i>so many of your more</i>

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:32.514
<i>- controversial policies?</i>
<i>- No. He's his own person.</i>

01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:35.075
<i>Raymond and I may disagree</i>
<i>on certain issues,</i>

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:38.317
<i>but I think we share</i>
<i>the same fundamental vision</i>

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:39.873
<i>of what this country can be.</i>

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:41.752
<i>- Which is?</i>
<i>- Better.</i>

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:43.473
<i>Better and better.</i>

01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:45.716
<i>Safer, braver, stronger.</i>

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:48.878
<i>A beacon of freedom</i>
<i>in a world troubled by shadows.</i>

01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:50.832
<i>America must prevail.</i>

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:54.316
<i>The future and survival</i>
<i>of modern civilization,</i>

01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:57.080
<i>democracy, freedom,</i>
<i>all depend upon it.</i>

01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:59.236
<i>So your son, Congressman Shaw...</i>

01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:01.717
Rosie.

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:11.000
I was in the park on Friday?

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:13.876
We were in the park on Monday.

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:16.588
Monday?

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:19.117
- Yep.
- Monday.

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:25.552
We were flying low.
It's, like, over the ocean, and just...

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:28.073
A field hospital.

01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:31.397
And they took us up to this place.

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:33.875
- Where? Military?
- I don't know. I don't know.

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:35.559
Just state-of-the-art stuff everywhere.

01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:39.912
Stainless steel and wires
and tubes and monitors.

01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:47.670
- Were you tortured?
- No. Yeah.

01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:50.838
I mean, there was pain.
You know, it was like...

01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:55.553
I don't know what they call it.

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:58.072
Invasive procedure.

01:11:58.280 --> 01:11:59.713
For example?

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:02.150
Like what? What do you mean?

01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:17.711
Invasive.

01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:19.956
See, they were in my head...

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:22.791
...and they made me...

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:28.238
Well, Raymond Shaw,
they made him kill somebody.

01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:29.839
<i>Like it was nothing.</i>

01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:32.349
<i>Private Robert Baker.</i>

01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:33.879
That's who it was, it was a private.

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:36.435
One of my soldiers.

01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:39.749
I think they made me
kill somebody too.

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:43.671
<i>A kid named Eddie Ingram.</i>

01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:46.519
Private Ingram, stand up.

01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:49.712
Walk a few steps, please.

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:54.351
And if you could secure the door,
please, Chris.

01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:56.793
Captain Marco.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.672
Stand up.

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:01.559
- Raymond.
- Yes, sir.

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:03.876
There's a gun on the cupboard.

01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:07.117
Would you please take it
and give it to Captain Marco.

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:08.753
Yes, sir.

01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:10.188
Here.

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:12.909
Captain.

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:18.152
Captain Marco,

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:20.999
please shoot Private Ingram.

01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:33.559
Now, Raymond,

01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:35.990
suffocate Private Baker.

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:37.189
Kill him.

01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:55.232
Keep going, Raymond.

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:15.113
I knew the...
A soldier knows the enemy.

01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:16.912
I'm in command.

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:19.429
That's primary, I know.

01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:21.792
I thought I knew...

01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:24.595
...who the enemy was.

01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:28.839
My men, they trusted me
with their lives, you know?

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:30.519
Don't.

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:32.233
Don't touch me.

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:39.315
Ben, the person that did this,
what was his name?

01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:41.351
Can you remember?

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:44.711
Did he have a name?

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:50.438
Ben?

01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:43.548
Smile if you like.

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:47.913
This will just take a minute.

01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:57.719
<i>I see you there all the time.</i>

01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:00.115
<i>Bennett Marco.</i>
<i>Checks from First National Bank.</i>

01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:03.756
<i>Romance novels, instant noodles,</i>
<i>NoDoz and tomatoes.</i>

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.594
<i>Old friend up there,</i>
<i>an old Army friend that...</i>

01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:10.394
<i>Well, he's in politics now...</i>

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.399
<i>What else did we talk about?</i>

01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:16.670
<i>What happened to you</i>
<i>after you were captured.</i>

01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:18.953
<i>Black helicopters,</i>
<i>secret laboratories...</i>

01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:24.549
<i>... mad scientist, mind drugs...</i>

01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:27.793
<i>... shock torture</i>
<i>and Raymond Shaw.</i>

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.956
<i>- You don't believe any of it, do you?</i>
<i>- It's crazy.</i>

01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:31.878
<i>- It sounds crazy, doesn't it?</i>
<i>- It sounds crazy.</i>

01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:33.957
<i>That's what they wanted</i>
<i>me to think too.</i>

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:35.957
<i>It's exactly what they want</i>
<i>you to think.</i>

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.150
<i>What about the other guys</i>
<i>from your unit?</i>

01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:42.834
<i>Where are they?</i>

01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:47.113
<i>They're all gone.</i>
<i>So-called natural causes.</i>

01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:49.880
<i>Owens died of cancer in '97.</i>

01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:53.478
<i>Villalobos' car crashed.</i>

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:55.033
<i>Atkins committed suicide.</i>

01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:58.152
<i>Jameson died 9/11, Pentagon.</i>

01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:01.713
<i>- Ben?</i>
<i>- Yeah?</i>

01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:03.956
<i>- Did he have a name?</i>
<i>- Who?</i>

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:06.674
<i>The person that did this, Ben.</i>

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:09.599
<i>What was his name?</i>
<i>Can you remember?</i>

01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:12.394
<i>Ben.</i>

01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:14.318
<i>- Yeah?</i>
<i>- Did he have a name?</i>

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:16.508
<i>You only have to look</i>
<i>at the enormous strides made</i>

01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:18.790
<i>in the last decade</i>
<i>with the genetic reconfiguration</i>

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.991
<i>of the noble tomato.</i>

01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:23.873
<i>What was happening was the tomato</i>
<i>was over-ripening in the process</i>

01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:25.798
<i>and it was losing its flavor.</i>

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.390
<i>It's actually a very simple procedure</i>
<i>to deactivate the gene concerned.</i>

01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:32.831
<i>And the same thing</i>
<i>can be applied to ourselves.</i>

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:34.029
<i>At a flick of a switch,</i>

01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:36.959
<i>we can adjust character,</i>

01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:38.798
<i>change personality.</i>

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.389
<i>And of course, more importantly...</i>

01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:45.232
<i>... we can offset</i>
<i>the ravages of dementia</i>

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:50.195
<i>by implanting memory or adjusting</i>
<i>the synaptic connections.</i>

01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:53.676
<i>We can free people</i>
<i>from the terrible burden</i>

01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:56.075
<i>of an emotionally</i>
<i>compromised past.</i>

01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:01.553
- Watch where you're going!
- Sorry.

01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:02.795
Watch where you're going!

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.831
Just back up! Just back up.

01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:08.112
Watch it. Watch it. Shut up.

01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:11.638
Take it easy, sir.

01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:19.072
I called the Pentagon and they told me
he's on medical leave.

01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:22.989
Secret Service, they got him on a
couple of their watch and observe lists.

01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:26.478
I guess there's been some trouble
with this guy

01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:28.398
involving Congressman Shaw.

01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:30.834
Oh?

01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:37.110
Among the shareholders
in Manchurian Global,

01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:39.356
were they to ever publish a list,
which they won't,

01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:42.757
you would find former presidents,
deposed kings,

01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:45.349
trust fund terrorists,
fallen Communist dictators,

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:48.996
ayatollahs, African warlords
and retired prime ministers.

01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:51.191
- See what I mean?
- I get it. They're big. They're huge.

01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:52.753
They're... They're...
They're gigantic.

01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:54.757
I can't touch them. I get it.
I don't want to.

01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:56.959
And you bring me rumors
and conjecture.

01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:58.991
I started with nightmares.
Rumors, conjectures,

01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:00.599
that's a giant leap forward.

01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:03.958
Nightmares that you've interpreted
using as primary resources

01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:05.275
A, your spotty memory,

01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:07.118
B, the Internet,

01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:10.596
sacred sanctuary of idiots and nutters.
That's how they're gonna look at this.

01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:13.155
And C, a crazy man's notebook,

01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:15.157
along with evidence you chewed
out of a man's back.

01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:17.396
All neatly stitched together
with a common thread

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:21.513
of a supremely powerful,
well-connected private equity fund,

01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:23.312
who, if you ever get
anywhere near them,

01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:25.033
will plead ignorance
and be shocked.

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:26.275
Shocked to learn

01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:28.914
what some of their subsidiary
partners are engaged in.

01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:30.997
I could give a rat's ass
about Manchurian Global, sir.

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:32.713
I could give a rat's ass about them.

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:35.157
That is not why I'm here.

01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:41.111
I looked you up too, senator.

01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:44.758
Oh?

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:47.478
You were in the Army.

01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:48.829
I was drafted.

01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:51.634
Didn't make much of a soldier,
I'm afraid. Let me see this.

01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:54.513
That's not what I saw in the record.
That's not what the record says, sir.

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:57.359
And you know how it works.

01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:59.955
Wars are fought
one battle at a time.

01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:02.355
Battles, you win one bullet at a time.

01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:05.074
And I'd be lying to you if I said

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:07.157
that I didn't factor in,
in a huge way,

01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:10.033
the fact that you have
a vested, personal,

01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:12.879
political and patriotic interest
in how all of this shakes out.

01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:14.877
I'd be lying to you.

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:18.597
You're right, major.

01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:20.599
I do.

01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:25.279
<i>A $5000-a-plate dinner honoring</i>
<i>the CEO of Votron Incorporated,</i>

01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:28.711
<i>the nation's third-largest producer of</i>
<i>the controversial touch-screen units</i>

01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:31.753
<i>that will be used in the forthcoming</i>
<i>election, was disrupted last night,</i>

01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:34.520
<i>when protestors disguised as</i>
<i>waiters and kitchen staff</i>

01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:37.439
<i>unleashed a blizzard</i>
<i>of symbolic chads from above,</i>

01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:38.959
<i>resulting in a momentary panic.</i>

01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:42.311
<i>The supporters of presidential hopeful</i>
<i>Vice President Edward Nelson</i>

01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:44.431
<i>fled to exits and dove under tables.</i>

01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:48.553
<i>Security personnel quickly subdued</i>
<i>the protestors, one of whom...</i>

01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:51.352
The man is insane, Tom.

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:53.232
Full-blown schizophrenia.

01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:56.591
He's been stalking Raymond,
the FBI is all over this already.

01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:58.756
I've seen the files.

01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:01.709
- Have you seen them?
- All over what?

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.958
Your bipolar war buddy
has been sharing his dreams

01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:07.752
with Senator Jordan.

01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:09.389
Hello, Raymond.

01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:12.355
Hello, senator.
How's Jocelyn?

01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:15.552
Have you fact-checked this
with anyone, Tom?

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.479
Raymond.

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:22.871
Do you recognize this man?

01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:26.199
No.

01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:28.391
His name is Atticus Noyle.

01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:31.150
He's a South African scientist
and mercenary.

01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:33.828
Someone our CIA turned to

01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:37.077
for covert mind warfare
against the Soviets in Afghanistan.

01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:40.272
Someone who has sold
his technology and services

01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:43.119
to terrorists and rogue states.

01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:45.516
And what does he
have to do with me?

01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:50.189
Major Bennett Marco
claims that this man...

01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:51.635
...brainwashed you.

01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:53.353
In his dreams.

01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:56.116
Contrived to have you win
the Medal of Honor.

01:24:56.640 --> 01:24:59.996
And has you poised to be the first
privately owned and operated

01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:01.792
vice president of the United States.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.275
Sir, I've already spoken
with Ben Marco.

01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:06.994
Unfortunately, he's not a well man.

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:08.428
He's delusional.

01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:10.198
Nevertheless,

01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:12.709
he's pulled from his mad hat

01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:14.990
some remarkably lucid connections

01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:17.760
between his dreams
of your exploits in Kuwait

01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:19.632
and this Dr. Noyle

01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:21.990
and the private equity fund
Manchurian Global,

01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:25.637
your mother's primary political
benefactor for the past 15 years.

01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:28.434
Oh, come on, Tom.
They contribute to half the Senate.

01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:30.198
Both sides of the aisle.

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:31.549
What are you saying?

01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:36.028
At the time of Desert Storm,
Dr. Atticus Noyle

01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:38.754
was working under a research grant
from Manchurian Global,

01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:41.520
developing deep implant
behavior modification.

01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:43.358
Oh, my God.

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:45.551
Rogue scientists, mind control,
Manchurian Global.

01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:46.670
- You.
- Tom.

01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:48.233
Connect the dots, Raymond.

01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:51.352
Where was your famous
Lost Patrol

01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:53.949
for those three missing days?

01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:57.470
Eluding capture in the desert?
Or somewhere else,

01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:00.672
being microwaved
by this Atticus Noyle?

01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:03.110
- Oh, Tom.
- I'm sorry, senator,

01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:06.232
but what exactly
are you suggesting I do?

01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:08.879
Bow out gracefully.

01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:10.593
Personal reasons,
an obscure illness.

01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:13.076
Yield your spot on the ticket
and go into seclusion.

01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:14.998
Oh, that's what this is about.

01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:17.395
And then surrender yourself
to federal authorities.

01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:19.192
Help them trace this thing
to its source

01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:22.119
and address whatever damage
may have been done to you.

01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:24.914
And I'll be waiting
for your press announcement

01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:26.314
first thing in the morning.

01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:28.078
- And then we'll talk.
- Tom.

01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:31.192
If there's any inkling of truth
in any of these charges,

01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:33.550
if anyone has ever harmed
a hair on his head,

01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:34.909
I will find out about it.

01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:36.758
You have 12 hours, senator.

01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:39.315
But if it's not true,

01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:41.795
I will see you impeached
on the floor of the Senate

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.116
and bury you.

01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:48.513
Good night.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.991
It's preposterous.

01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:56.910
Idiotic story.

01:26:57.920 --> 01:26:59.990
Mother, there's something
I have to tell you.

01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:01.189
What?

01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:05.159
I've been having the dreams.

01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:08.589
Ben said there were tests
they could run to see if...

01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:11.155
No. Where are you going?

01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:12.954
Sergeant Shaw.

01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:14.593
What?

01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:18.310
Sergeant Raymond Shaw.

01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:20.792
Mother, I...

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.117
Raymond Prentiss Shaw.

01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:26.313
Yes.

01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:29.958
Listen.

01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:18.828
<i>Good morning to you all,</i>

01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:21.110
<i>and welcome to Amtrak's</i>
<i>northbound Acela,</i>

01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:24.630
<i>making station stops</i>
<i>at Baltimore, Philadelphia,</i>

01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:27.274
<i>Newark, New York's</i>
<i>Penn Station</i>

01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:29.789
<i>and Boston as the last stop...</i>

01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:43.316
Who's that?

01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:47.478
It's Raymond, sir.

01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:49.995
Oh, don't do that.

01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:52.191
You're gonna get
soaking wet, Raymond.

01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:55.639
Raymond.

01:28:57.280 --> 01:28:59.316
I came to apologize, sir.

01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:02.515
Raymond, what are you doing?

01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:05.075
- I'm sorry.
- We'll get some help for you, son.

01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:08.273
It's not your fault, Raymond.
It's not your fault.

01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:10.438
- I'm sorry, sir.
- It's your mother...

01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:38.639
Dad!

01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:41.233
Help!

01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:50.638
Oh, God. Daddy!

01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:53.679
Help!

01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:07.510
Raymond? What are you doing?!

01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:11.918
What is going on?
What is happening?

01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:14.279
Where's my father?

01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:15.913
What are you doing?

01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:19.359
Dad! Dad!

01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:00.599
<i>The five-term senator</i>

01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:03.951
<i>and recent front-runner for his party's</i>
<i>vice presidential nomination</i>

01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:06.151
<i>appears to have</i>
<i>accidentally drowned</i>

01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:10.194
<i>when his kayak overturned near</i>
<i>his Chesapeake Bay weekend home.</i>

01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:13.119
<i>Police say his daughter,</i>
<i>35-year-old Jocelyn,</i>

01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:14.958
<i>may have been trying</i>
<i>to rescue Jordan</i>

01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:18.675
<i>when she was herself overcome</i>
<i>by the icy water.</i>

01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:20.996
<i>The bodies of Senator Jordan</i>
<i>and his daughter</i>

01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:23.475
<i>were discovered this morning</i>
<i>by a crab fisherman</i>

01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:26.752
<i>who spotted the capsized kayak</i>
<i>floating far offshore,</i>

01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:29.554
<i>nearly a mile from</i>
<i>Senator Jordan's residence.</i>

01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:33.230
<i>Neighbors say the senator was an</i>
<i>expert kayaker whose morning trips</i>

01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:36.750
<i>were a familiar sight along</i>
<i>the western bank of the Bay.</i>

01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:39.952
<i>Governor Arthur, do you have</i>
<i>any comment on this tragic event?</i>

01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:44.433
<i>Senator Jordan was a statesman</i>
<i>of the highest integrity.</i>

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.911
<i>Tom Jordan was a friend.</i>

01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:49.151
<i>A damn fine man.</i>

01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:51.750
<i>Just a great American.</i>

01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:54.838
<i>That's all for now. We'll have</i>
<i>something for you a little later.</i>

01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:57.548

<i>It is a move that could save the</i>

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:14.109
How does Arthur die?

01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:16.277
You know who I'm talking about,
the new president.

01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:18.710
If he dies, Raymond Shaw becomes
the new president, doesn't he?

01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:20.638
Chain of succession.
That's what you got in mind.

01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:21.955
That's what you people wanna do.

01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:24.116
You wanna really run the world,
don't you, Susie? Rosie?

01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:26.993
Whatever the hell your name is. I got
my library card and I got your tapes.

01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:28.918
I do my research too.
We're going to the feds,

01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:31.918
we're going to the police,
the newspapers, whatever it takes.

01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:34.437
I am the feds.

01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:36.517
Now, get off me!

01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:42.032
Get off of me!

01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:55.432
We found...

01:32:56.160 --> 01:32:58.276
...an implant device...

01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:00.758
...in Al Melvin.

01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:03.557
You found one in Melvin.

01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:05.557
Just like you said.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:12.118
I'm part of a shadow unit.
We've been watching you.

01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:15.750
Trying to sort this thing out.

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:18.438
This isn't an election, this is a coup.

01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:22.269
This is... In our own country,
a regime change, in our own country.

01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:24.630
Ben, don't. Ben.

01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:29.072
This is rich people, Manchurian Global
funding bad science

01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:33.831
to put a sleeper in the White House,
and that's what's going on, Rosie.

01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:36.230
- That's what's going on.
- I wanna believe you.

01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:39.159
Well, then, believe me.
Help me. Help me.

01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:40.952
Shoot me, then.
Help me or shoot me.

01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:42.559
Make a decision.

01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:44.830
Make a decision.

01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:55.674
I made a decision
when I met you, Ben.

01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:03.873
Now, why don't you show me
what you have in your file.

01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:06.592
- Sir!
- Congressman!

01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:11.989
Sir, do you have a statement
for us tonight?

01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:15.830
- Was exceptionally clear
and simple.

01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:18.554
A stronger, safer,
more profitable world

01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:21.479
through uncorruptible
top-level management.

01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:23.318
We trust you with our technology

01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:25.238
and suddenly you turn him
into a common hit man.

01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:28.113
How fucking dare you.
I trusted you with my son.

01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:29.309
You didn't even ask us...

01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:32.034
Don't lecture me! You swore to me
that this was fail-safe.

01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:34.390
No leaks, no glitches, no...
No dreams.

01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:36.238
Not even a shadow of what was done
to Raymond...

01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:38.396
You needed to ask before you acted.
This is not a...

01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:41.114
Tom Jordan was going to destroy
my son and everything I've worked for,

01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:43.470
and every one of us along with it.
And you wanted me to what?

01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:45.875
- Call a meeting?
- Now, look, look, look.

01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:49.794
In the larger course of history...

01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:51.953
...there are key players...

01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:54.436
...and role players, senator.

01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:58.428
Bullshit! This is about my son
and the future of this country.

01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:01.994
I thought we understood each other.

01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:04.591
I think we do. I think we really do.

01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:07.314
- Your god is money.
- Oh, wait, wait, and yours is?

01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:08.873
No, no. I'm a believer.

01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:10.911
I am an optimist.
I believe in the future.

01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:12.633
And people who do,
the ones who make history

01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:14.398
instead of just sitting around
watching it,

01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:16.795
no, they're willing to take
the big risks.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:18.638
Yes, I made a decision.

01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:21.998
Oh, God! Where are
all the men anymore?

01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:24.276
My father, Tyler Prentiss,
never asked,

01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:26.789
"Is this okay? Is this okay?"

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.877
You know what I'm saying, Mark?

01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:31.799
He just did what needed to be done.

01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:35.318
<i>Come on, rise and shine, New York.</i>
<i>It's a big day in the Big Apple.</i>

01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:38.796
<i>That's right. All polls indicate</i>
<i>that New Yorkers will be turning out</i>

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.036
<i>in record numbers today</i>
<i>across the five boroughs</i>

01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:42.719
<i>to select a new president.</i>

01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:45.275
<i>At least, that's how the rulebook</i>
<i>says it's supposed to happen.</i>

01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:46.959
<i>The polls open at 6 a.m.</i>

01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:50.391
<i>And bars and taverns in Manhattan,</i>
<i>Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx,</i>

01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:53.433
<i>and Staten Island will be</i>
<i>opening shortly thereafter.</i>

01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:57.349
<i>That's right, New Yorkers. We are</i>
<i>free to drink and vote all day today.</i>

01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:16.720
Thank you. Thank you.

01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:18.672
Thanks for coming out.

01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:23.597
Congressman, good luck.

01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:26.958
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:31.357
- Hey. Thank you very much.
- The next vice president, sir.

01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:32.834
I hope so.

01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:35.799
- Let's have a win.
- We're with you. We're with you.

01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:37.912
Thank you, Tony, take care.

01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:42.479
Thank you.

01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:07.993
Take care. Goodbye.
Thanks very much.

01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:26.519
It's clean.

01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:31.635
It's clean.

01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:34.353
It's all right, Evan.

01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:43.195
How's your back?

01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:48.750
I've been having the dreams, Ben.

01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:51.232
Oh, that's good.

01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:53.354
They're inside my head.

01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:54.879
We'll get them out. I got the proof.

01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:56.911
I know what they did to us.
I just don't know why.

01:37:57.120 --> 01:37:58.269
I dream things, Ben.

01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:00.710
Terrible things that can't
possibly have happened.

01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:02.991
- I'm gone, Ben...
- No, you're not, you're right here.

01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:04.919
Ben...

01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:07.791
...there's something I want
you to have.

01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:14.437
I don't deserve this.

01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:21.233
Jocelyn's dead.

01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:23.635
I know.

01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:25.988
And the senator.

01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:29.234
Yeah.

01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:32.592
Did I?

01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:36.597
I think so, Raymond, yes.

01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:42.112
I don't remember, Ben.
I don't remember.

01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:44.519
Raymond...

01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:47.679
...did they tell you what it is
they want you to do?

01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:49.029
That's what I gotta find out.

01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:52.357
We gotta find out what's gonna
happen, where it's gonna happen...

01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:55.791
Are we friends, Ben?
I wanna believe we were friends.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:00.551
We are connected and that's
something nobody can take from us.

01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:03.510
You could've had me locked up,
but you didn't.

01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:05.915
That's proof that there's something
deep inside.

01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:07.678
There's a part that they can't get to.

01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:10.314
And it's deep inside of us.
And that's where the truth is.

01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:13.398
That's our only hope. That's what
you and me need to tap into,

01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:16.398
and that's what you and I are gonna
use to take them out, Raymond.

01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:18.670
We don't have much time. Please.

01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:24.476
- I thought you were smarter than that.
- Raymond, please.

01:39:24.680 --> 01:39:26.272
You don't think they saw this
coming, Ben?

01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:29.475
You don't think they factored you in?

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.197
I am the enemy, Major Marco.

01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:37.432
What are you talking about?

01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:43.593
Yes, Mother.

01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:46.671
Yes, he's right here.

01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:51.269
- She wants you.
- Me?

01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:56.395
Yes, senator.

01:39:56.600 --> 01:39:59.433
<i>- Is this Captain Marco?</i>
- Yeah.

01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:02.440
<i>Captain Bennett Marco?</i>

01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:04.070
Yes.

01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:08.918
<i>Bennett Ezekiel Marco.</i>

01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:10.633
Yes.

01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:17.193
<i>Listen.</i>

01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:50.038
Hurry up!

01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:04.072
Major Marco?

01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:17.679
Ben?

01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:22.829
- People can get together whenever
they want and not get in trouble.

01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:26.158
People should be allowed to say
what is on their mind...

01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:37.394
The Bill of Rights gives people...

01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:45.555
Thank you.

01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:47.910
<i>The candidates made ritual trips</i>
<i>to the voting booths today.</i>

01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:50.509
<i>Governor Arthur,</i>
<i>casting his ballot in North Platte,</i>

01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:53.359
<i>will spend election night in the Big Apple</i>
<i>with running mate Raymond Shaw</i>

01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:55.312
<i>for their anticipated victory party.</i>

01:41:55.520 --> 01:41:58.034
<i>The presidential rival,</i>
<i>incumbent Vice President Nelson</i>

01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:00.595
<i>returned to his home</i>
<i>in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.</i>

01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:02.631
<i>He attended special church services</i>
<i>this morning...</i>

01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:54.597
- All clear.
<i>- Raymond...</i>

01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:56.279
- Clear.
<i>- ... listen.</i>

01:42:56.480 --> 01:43:00.758
<i>The bullet will strike Bob Arthur</i>
<i>the moment you step forward</i>

01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:03.633
<i>and arrive on your star beside him.</i>

01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:06.832
Because the assassin...

01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:12.353
...the deranged, obsessed...

01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:16.269
...tragically paranoid lone gunman...

01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:19.313
...is trying to kill you.

01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:22.629
Major Marco's
an excellent marksman.

01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:26.670
But you must stay very, very still

01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:30.156
and stand right where you're
supposed to stand.

01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:32.312
What happens to Ben?

01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:36.233
The assassin always dies, baby.

01:43:36.680 --> 01:43:39.319
It's necessary for
the national healing.

01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:50.838
I'm sure you will never entirely
comprehend this, darling.

01:43:56.800 --> 01:43:59.155
But I want you to know, Raymond...

01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:01.871
...I did this for you.

01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:05.920
So that you could have
what I couldn't.

01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:08.715
What your father threw away.

01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:12.996
The opportunity to lead this nation.

01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:17.312
- I know, Mother.
- And so I let them take you

01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:19.317
and change you a little bit.

01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:21.511
Not so much that you would notice,

01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:27.875
but just enough to bring you back
to who you really are.

01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:33.153
And to what you will become.

01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:39.396
Oh, and look at you.

01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:42.831
Look at you.
Look what you've achieved,

01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:46.396
look how far we've come.
It's working, Raymond.

01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:50.519
And you're going to save
our country now.

01:44:51.480 --> 01:44:54.916
In the hour of her greatest need.

01:44:56.640 --> 01:44:58.232
Yes, Mother.

01:45:02.360 --> 01:45:03.873
But...

01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:09.870
But when you smile...

01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:15.191
...oh, darling, when you smile,
that's what I live for.

01:45:17.200 --> 01:45:19.953
When you smile.

Yep.

No, no, Jimmy, the other one. The one

Very good.

01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:26.358

Okay.

Damn it.

01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:30.879
...get out...

01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:34.995
...to where the sky was. And had to...

01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:39.516
...get to the water.
Escape. Regroup.

01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:41.234
Come back, get my men.

01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:45.069
I thought that if I could just
get to the water...

01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:48.316
