00:09.010 --> 00:13.515
<i>NARRATOR". We have already seen
Gotham City's charter stolen...</i>

00:13.723 --> 00:18.228
<i>...by the rottenest egg of them all, Egghead.</i>

00:18.561 --> 00:22.899
<i>Gordon and O'Hara with egg on their faces.</i>

00:23.107 --> 00:27.570
<i>Batman and Robin answer their weekly call.</i>

00:27.779 --> 00:31.533
<i>The city really owned
by the Mohican Indians...</i>

00:31.741 --> 00:34.911
<i>...and only leased by the citizens.</i>

00:35.119 --> 00:39.666
<i>Nine pelts paid every five years
to renew the lease...</i>

00:39.874 --> 00:41.626
<i>...or it will egg-xpire.</i>

00:41.834 --> 00:44.629
<i>Was this Eggheads plan?</i>

00:45.171 --> 00:47.257
<i>It was.</i>

00:47.840 --> 00:52.971
<i>Chief Screaming Chicken,
last of the Mohicans, gave his word.</i>

00:53.346 --> 00:56.558
<i>But he was an Indian giver.</i>

00:57.517 --> 01:00.311
<i>Batman and Robin attack.</i>

01:01.604 --> 01:04.440
<i>A millionaire kidnapped.</i>

01:05.441 --> 01:08.736
<i>Another millionaire kidnapped.</i>

01:09.529 --> 01:13.241
<i>Our millionaire kidnapped.</i>

01:13.616 --> 01:16.911
<i>Egghead suspects that
Bruce Wayne is Batman.</i>

01:17.120 --> 01:20.331
<i>Will this fiendish machine
vacuum his brain?</i>

01:20.540 --> 01:22.917
<i>Holy hypothesis!</i>

01:23.293 --> 01:27.130
<i>The Caped Crusader held in his chair
by electromagnetic power.</i>

01:27.338 --> 01:30.258
<i>Can this really be happening?</i>

01:30.425 --> 01:34.262
<i>Let this serve as a warning
to anyone with a delicate nature.</i>

01:34.470 --> 01:38.933
<i>The most egg-xcruciating
circumstances are yet to come.</i>

02:59.222 --> 03:04.143
Four seconds and you'll be
as helpless as a newborn babe.

03:04.310 --> 03:06.854
Ha, ha. How egg-xotic.

03:36.718 --> 03:38.803
Nice going, Dick. I thought I was a goner.

03:40.012 --> 03:41.764
Well, was--? Is he? Is he?

03:41.973 --> 03:44.142
Only a bit of information
trickled through...

03:44.350 --> 03:47.228
...before that accursed teenager
turned the switch.

03:47.437 --> 03:49.981
- And?
-That man has a mind full of trivia.

03:50.189 --> 03:52.483
It's inconceivable that he could be Batman.

03:53.484 --> 03:56.487
Back, back, I say.

03:56.696 --> 03:59.615
This is a radar egg.

03:59.824 --> 04:03.911
And the slightest vibration
will make it egg-xplode...

04:04.120 --> 04:11.127
...and turn this into a room carpeted
with wall-to-wall millionaires.

04:16.716 --> 04:18.009
Let's get out of here.

04:18.216 --> 04:22.805
It's two minutes before midnight
and the lease is about to egg-xpire.

04:23.014 --> 04:25.183
Nothing can stop us now.

04:26.100 --> 04:28.936
We have only one chance.

04:30.021 --> 04:33.524
This type of mechanism
is only sensitive up to about 6 feet.

04:33.733 --> 04:35.735
Do exactly as I do.

04:54.670 --> 04:58.758
We just can't leave that bomb there, Bruce.
Some innocent bystander might get hurt.

04:58.966 --> 05:02.595
Correct. Therefore we must trigger
that mechanism before we leave.

05:02.804 --> 05:04.263
- Tim, Pete, wait outside.
-But--

05:04.430 --> 05:07.767
- Please, please, there's no time to lose.
-Okay.

05:07.975 --> 05:11.312
- Now what?
-We play marbles.

05:11.521 --> 05:12.563
Marbles?

05:12.772 --> 05:15.316
I heard Egghead say
he didn't think you were Batman.

05:15.525 --> 05:17.193
And the machine worked, didn't it?

05:17.401 --> 05:19.529
Only too well, Dick.

05:19.737 --> 05:22.281
After years of mental conditioning...

05:22.490 --> 05:25.076
...I was able to block off
that portion of my brain...

05:25.284 --> 05:26.869
...pertaining to my dual identity.

05:27.203 --> 05:30.581
I couldn't have lasted much longer, though.
All right, let's get down.

05:35.586 --> 05:37.880
You got it on the first shot.

05:38.089 --> 05:41.717
At the age of 11,
I was junior marble champion of Gotham City.

05:41.926 --> 05:44.887
- Even then.
-Let's go.

05:48.558 --> 05:51.185
12:03.

05:51.394 --> 05:55.147
I can't conceive of what happened
to those three millionaires.

05:55.356 --> 05:59.068
It's all too incredible, but Gotham City
now belongs to Chief Screaming Chicken.

05:59.277 --> 06:02.071
You better believe it, buddy.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.326
Oh.

06:07.577 --> 06:09.745
- What happened to you?
-A long story. Are we--?

06:09.954 --> 06:11.163
Too late.

06:11.372 --> 06:14.625
Midnight came and went,
and with it the fate of Gotham City.

06:14.834 --> 06:20.089
You no show up,
me now own Gotham City and all suburbs.

06:20.298 --> 06:23.175
That is the way the Wigwam watusies.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.013
But is it legal, Mr. Mayor?

06:27.221 --> 06:30.391
- I'm afraid so, Batman.
-Even though Egghead kidnapped...

06:30.558 --> 06:34.228
...the millionaires and held them
until after midnight? That's against the law.

06:34.395 --> 06:38.065
Boy Wonder,
there is no more law in Gotham City.

06:38.274 --> 06:39.650
We're at his mercy.

06:39.859 --> 06:42.111
We must give him enough rope,
commissioner.

06:42.320 --> 06:46.324
And let him be hoist
by his own petard. Trust me.

06:46.532 --> 06:50.494
Batman, we're in your hands
like we've never been before.

06:50.703 --> 06:51.954
Correction.

06:52.163 --> 06:54.040
You are in my hands.

06:54.248 --> 06:57.877
This is my official contract
with Chief Screaming Chicken.

06:58.085 --> 07:01.714
And it gives me complete control
of Gotham City as his emissary.

07:01.923 --> 07:03.466
You fiendish devil.

07:03.674 --> 07:08.137
Egg-xpletives will get you nowhere,
my cowled crime-buster.

07:08.346 --> 07:11.265
The Gotham City Charter is back in its case...

07:11.474 --> 07:14.268
...and it's quite egg-xplicit,
if you care to read it.

07:14.435 --> 07:16.687
You'll have to talk a little slower,
Eggy-pooh...

07:16.854 --> 07:19.231
...if I'm going to capture
all your wisdom on paper.

07:19.398 --> 07:21.233
You think anybody will buy his book...

07:21.400 --> 07:23.361
...on how to be a better criminal?
-Quiet.

07:23.569 --> 07:27.156
My first duty
as new leaseholder of Gotham City...

07:27.365 --> 07:32.453
...is hereby to fire
the mayor and the police commissioner.

07:32.662 --> 07:34.038
You can't do that.

07:34.246 --> 07:36.123
Oh, yes, I can.

07:36.332 --> 07:38.918
You are through. Finished. Fired.

07:39.126 --> 07:43.589
Up. Out. Out. Over. Up. Out.

07:43.798 --> 07:47.301
We're witnessing a new low
in community relations, Robin.

07:47.510 --> 07:49.971
And as for you, my caped incompetents...

07:50.179 --> 07:53.265
...I hereby egg-xpell you
from the Gotham City limits.

07:53.474 --> 07:56.394
If you so much as show your masks
around here again...

07:56.602 --> 07:59.480
...I'll have you both egg-xecuted.

08:18.624 --> 08:21.460
This is the saddest day
of my young life, Batman.

08:21.669 --> 08:24.463
What Will be, Will be.

08:25.047 --> 08:26.799
Goodbye, Gotham City.

08:27.008 --> 08:29.343
You were my kind of town.

08:34.807 --> 08:38.436
If Batman and Robin ever come back
to Gotham City...

08:38.852 --> 08:40.688
...they'll be shot on sight.

08:40.895 --> 08:43.774
- Ain't that great?
-Hold your egg-xuberance, Foo.

08:43.982 --> 08:48.696
My amazing brain tells me
that we haven't seen the last of them yet.

08:54.326 --> 08:55.661
We gotta move fast, Robin.

08:55.870 --> 08:59.373
The longer Egghead is in control
of Gotham City, the more chaos will erupt.

08:59.582 --> 09:00.958
What will we do? We're barred.

09:01.167 --> 09:03.669
This is one time when
Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson...

09:03.878 --> 09:06.130
...can do more good than Batman and Robin.
-How?

09:06.338 --> 09:09.216
Egghead said the city charter is back
in its resting place.

09:09.425 --> 09:11.635
My training in legal matters has taught me...

09:11.844 --> 09:16.474
...that every document has some fine print
that is usually overlooked.

09:16.682 --> 09:19.810
Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson
are going to steal the charter.

09:20.019 --> 09:22.855
Wow, talk about Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

09:27.860 --> 09:29.570
Stop them!

09:30.571 --> 09:33.741
Stop them! They've just stolen
$50,000 worth of precious jewels.

09:33.949 --> 09:37.912
I'm sorry, sir. Commissioner Egghead says
we're not allowed to arrest his friends.

09:38.120 --> 09:40.790
Well, if you won't do anything
about it, I will.

09:40.998 --> 09:44.168
Sir. Sir, come back here, please.

09:44.710 --> 09:48.214
- I'm afraid I'm gonna have to give you a ticket.
-A ticket? For what?

09:48.422 --> 09:50.341
Jaywalking.

09:56.889 --> 09:58.099
I don't understand.

09:58.265 --> 10:01.227
Murderers and thieves are making
Gotham City an unfit place to live in...

10:01.435 --> 10:04.355
...and you stopped me
to tell me to fasten my seatbelt.

10:04.563 --> 10:06.315
I'm just doing my job, sir.

10:08.776 --> 10:11.612
With all the noise and the shooting
and everything going on...

10:11.779 --> 10:15.074
...who could blame me
for missing that litter basket with my tissue?

10:15.282 --> 10:19.203
Just the facts, ma'am.
Will you please give me just the facts?

10:20.788 --> 10:25.334
<i>REPORTER : It's 3:00 in Gotham City,
and time for the 11th hour news.</i>

10:25.835 --> 10:27.837
<i>Our town is in an uproar.</i>

10:28.045 --> 10:30.881
<i>Robberies are taking place
all over Gotham City...</i>

10:31.090 --> 10:33.843
<i>...and the police are powerless to stop them.</i>

10:34.051 --> 10:38.806
<i>Commissioner Egghead seems to take
great delight at the happenings.</i>

10:39.014 --> 10:43.227
<i>The big question is,
where are Batman and Robin?</i>

10:43.435 --> 10:45.938
<i>Even though they've been banned
from the city limits...</i>

10:46.147 --> 10:50.943
...all <i>Gotham City is hoping for them
to help us in our hour of need.</i>

10:51.402 --> 10:54.613
Things may have gotten
somewhat out of hand, Dick.

10:54.822 --> 10:57.241
Why don't we take a nice drive into the city?

10:57.449 --> 10:58.951
- Great.
-Is that wise, sir?

10:59.160 --> 11:02.163
We have no other choice.

11:06.709 --> 11:09.003
How are we going to open it?

11:09.461 --> 11:12.173
We'll have to break the case.

11:12.381 --> 11:15.593
Why don't you use the Batbeam
in the spare utility belt you wear?

11:15.801 --> 11:18.971
If I did, Egghead might suspect Batman.

11:19.180 --> 11:22.975
No, we'll use ordinary means.

11:31.233 --> 11:36.572
They fell into the trap. Oh, I am egg-static.
Ha-ha-ha.

11:36.780 --> 11:38.866
Calling all cars. Calling all cars.

11:39.074 --> 11:44.538
Be on the lookout for Batman and Robin
in the vicinity of the city hall.

11:44.997 --> 11:46.749
Well, gentlemen...

11:46.957 --> 11:50.336
...when we capture
the caped crime-Crushers...

11:50.544 --> 11:53.172
...we will remove their masks...

11:53.380 --> 11:57.635
...and egg-xpose their faces to the public.

11:57.843 --> 12:00.346
Then they will be out of business.

12:01.889 --> 12:04.099
I wonder who they are?

12:18.405 --> 12:22.243
Well, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson.
I'm surprised you came to Gotham City...

12:22.409 --> 12:23.827
...the way things are going.

12:23.994 --> 12:25.621
We had some business to attend to.

12:25.829 --> 12:28.999
Did you happen to see Batman and Robin
around the area?

12:29.208 --> 12:32.878
Commissioner Egghead has given my men
orders to shoot them on sight.

12:33.087 --> 12:35.214
I haven't seen Batman for weeks.

12:35.673 --> 12:37.007
Well, thanks anyhow.

12:46.225 --> 12:47.768
There it is.

12:47.977 --> 12:50.437
The clause we've been looking for.

12:50.646 --> 12:55.484
"If the heirs to Gotham City's lease
fail to make payment on the approved day...

12:55.693 --> 13:01.949
...said property reverts to the Mohican Indians
and/or their legal representatives.

13:02.157 --> 13:04.743
The only stipulation to this clause...

13:04.952 --> 13:08.831
...is that the property may never be leased
to anyone who's committed crimes...

13:09.039 --> 13:12.668
...against the city, territory, or the crown."

13:12.876 --> 13:15.629
In those days we were still a British colony.

13:15.838 --> 13:17.548
What does it mean, Batman?

13:17.756 --> 13:23.721
It means we've got that criminal
by his large, gray, double-A head.

13:23.929 --> 13:29.101
I don't think he'll be satisfied with half the loot
collected by the visiting gangs, Robin.

13:29.310 --> 13:34.106
- He must have something bigger in mind.
-What could it be?

13:34.315 --> 13:36.025
Think, Robin, think.

13:36.233 --> 13:39.320
Where is all the money in Gotham City kept?

13:39.528 --> 13:42.823
In the treasury, of course.
With the tax just having been collected...

13:42.990 --> 13:45.409
...there must be close
to $30 million in that vault.

13:45.617 --> 13:49.038
Right, Robin. And what's
a synonym for the word "treasury"?

13:49.246 --> 13:53.959
Depository? Strong room? Bursary?

13:54.376 --> 13:57.379
Of course, the English word for "treasury."

13:57.588 --> 13:59.840
<i>Exchequer .
-Or eggs-chequer.</i>

14:00.007 --> 14:03.010
- Oh, you've done it again.
-To the Batmobile.

14:12.728 --> 14:19.568
Here I am with 29 million George Washingtons,
and I don't feel the least bit crowded.

14:19.777 --> 14:23.947
And the beautiful part about it
is all of this money is tax-exempt.

14:24.156 --> 14:27.076
Me think you are crooks.
Me go tell the mayor.

14:27.284 --> 14:30.496
Oh, but my dear egg-xalted chief,
you are the mayor.

14:30.662 --> 14:33.707
- Ha, ha.
-Oh. Oh, you're right.

14:33.916 --> 14:35.834
Me have short memory span.

14:36.043 --> 14:39.630
I say, Foo Yung, will you loan me
a couple of hundred thousand or so?

14:39.838 --> 14:41.090
Of course, my dear.

14:41.507 --> 14:44.718
Here you are. Pay me back
whenever you can find the time.

14:44.885 --> 14:46.303
I'm in no hurry.

14:46.512 --> 14:48.847
Perfumes from Paris
and dresses from Rome.

14:49.056 --> 14:52.518
And my very own handsome guardsman
from Buckingham Palace.

14:52.726 --> 14:55.270
You know, one of those men who don't
giggle when you tickle them.

14:56.855 --> 14:58.023
And now--

14:58.232 --> 15:04.988
And now to egg-xpedite matters,
let's start packing this stuff up. Ha, ha!

15:05.197 --> 15:09.159
Is this the way it's all supposed
to end, Mayor Linseed?

15:09.576 --> 15:13.664
Not with a bang, but, uh, with a whimper?

15:14.164 --> 15:16.708
We're like two old warhorses
being put out to pasture.

15:16.875 --> 15:19.002
I never thought I'd see the day.

15:19.211 --> 15:20.295
And you haven't.

15:21.839 --> 15:25.342
Batman, Robin, you realize you're taking
a grave chance by coming here?

15:25.551 --> 15:29.680
- That's why we took the surreptitious route.
-Egghead's got a price on your cowl.

15:29.888 --> 15:34.226
The person bringing you in,
dead or alive, gets $50,000.

15:34.435 --> 15:37.479
- Holy recompense.
-That's all over now.

15:37.688 --> 15:41.483
A clause in the city charter refutes
anything Egghead might have planned.

15:41.692 --> 15:45.821
It specifically prohibits criminals
from leasing any of Gotham City.

15:46.029 --> 15:48.532
- Splendid news, Batman.
-What now?

15:48.740 --> 15:52.369
It's my guess that Egghead and his men
had another crime in mind.

15:52.578 --> 15:56.248
- We think they're going to loot the treasury.
-And we're going there right now.

16:05.299 --> 16:08.677
Clear all police channels
for an emergency message.

16:09.887 --> 16:13.682
This is Commissioner Gordon speaking.
Men, I have wonderful news for you.

16:13.891 --> 16:16.059
Batman and Robin are back.

16:16.268 --> 16:18.979
We no longer have to take
any of Eggheads guff...

16:19.188 --> 16:23.442
...because he no longer has a legal hold
on our fair city.

16:25.027 --> 16:29.198
Batman and Robin were gone from our ranks
less than 24 hours, Mayor Linseed.

16:29.406 --> 16:32.951
And you were a witness
to the havoc that was wrought.

16:33.160 --> 16:37.706
Call them the Dynamic Duo,
the caped crime-fighters, the foes of felons.

16:37.915 --> 16:40.334
Call them what you will.

16:40.501 --> 16:47.466
But thank your lucky stars
we can call them our friends.

16:47.674 --> 16:50.928
- We better hurry, Batman.
-Not too fast, Robin.

16:51.136 --> 16:57.142
In good Batclimbing, as in good driving,
one must never sacrifice safety for speed.

16:57.351 --> 16:59.686
Right again, Batman.

17:01.939 --> 17:03.649
Who are you, citizen?

17:03.857 --> 17:05.817
Oh, my name Jose Jimenez.

17:06.026 --> 17:08.319
And who, may I ask,
are you two nice people...

17:08.487 --> 17:12.156
...climbing down the side of this building
when the elevators are available?

17:12.366 --> 17:14.159
- I'm Batman.
- And I'm Robin.

17:14.326 --> 17:17.162
Ah, oh. I'm the foreman of a jury.

17:17.371 --> 17:21.625
We're trying to make up our minds what to do
to a terrible nasty criminal person, you know.

17:21.791 --> 17:25.253
- Oh.
- Trying to find out now. Excuse me.

17:26.128 --> 17:27.631
Oh, you decided?

17:28.423 --> 17:30.968
What? Oh.

17:31.760 --> 17:35.013
Fellas, could you leave the rope?

17:44.439 --> 17:46.608
Gone. Every penny is gone.

17:46.817 --> 17:50.696
- Holy banks.
-Almost $30 million in small bills.

17:58.287 --> 18:00.914
Oh! Oh, Mr. Masked Man, you are so right.

18:01.123 --> 18:04.501
That Egghead, one very bad hombre.

18:04.793 --> 18:08.380
- Where did he go, Chief Screaming Chicken?
-He leave me to hold them bag...

18:08.589 --> 18:10.507
...while he escape.
-But where?

18:10.716 --> 18:14.761
He say he must replenish
before he go to South America.

18:14.970 --> 18:16.597
Then they all lay high.

18:16.805 --> 18:17.973
Lay low.

18:18.181 --> 18:21.018
Lay low, yeah. Me wrong on direction, yeah.

18:21.226 --> 18:26.857
He say he lay low for one day
and then pretty soon maybe they all leave.

18:27.065 --> 18:29.401
Any particular place in South America?

18:29.568 --> 18:34.281
Oh, he say he take money,
all the money, and run Venezuela.

18:34.489 --> 18:38.910
Chief Screaming Chicken,
I think you've been led down a primrose path.

18:39.369 --> 18:42.247
My face is so red.

18:42.581 --> 18:44.750
Robin, tell Commissioner Gordon...

18:44.958 --> 18:48.670
...to alert all land, sea and air exits
from Gotham City.

18:48.879 --> 18:52.758
We must keep Egghead within the city limits
until we find out where his hideout is.

18:52.924 --> 18:54.384
Hm. Roger.

18:56.094 --> 18:58.597
Boy, it makes me feel good
to be a Gotham Cityite...

18:58.805 --> 19:01.141
...when I see how everybody
forgave Chief Chicken.

19:01.350 --> 19:05.896
You'll find that people are basically good.
They're merely reacting to their surroundings.

19:06.104 --> 19:09.733
Chief Screaming Chicken was wooed
from the path of righteousness...

19:09.941 --> 19:11.902
...by some extravagant promises.

19:12.110 --> 19:16.365
It's a human failing that all of us
are subject to at one time or another.

19:16.573 --> 19:20.202
But all that's water over the embankment.

19:20.410 --> 19:24.539
- Right now our job is to find Egghead.
-Mm. Any ideas?

19:24.748 --> 19:30.962
We know his diet consists solely
of grade triple-A white eggs.

19:31.171 --> 19:35.258
If he were to take a trip,
which all the evidence indicates he might do...

19:35.467 --> 19:39.346
...he would first have to load up
on all the eggs he could carry.

19:39.554 --> 19:40.806
Right.

19:41.014 --> 19:46.019
How many poultry farms, triple-A variety,
are there within the limits of Gotham City?

19:46.186 --> 19:50.357
Mm, three. Bernie's Chicken Farm
in the Lakewood area.

19:50.565 --> 19:53.652
But that farm produces only brown eggs.

19:53.819 --> 19:54.903
Hmm.

19:55.070 --> 19:57.989
Paul's Poultry Palace in Pimlico.

19:58.198 --> 20:02.744
- And if my memory serves me correctly--
-As it always does.

20:02.953 --> 20:08.291
--Paul's Poultry Palace has only
eight hens and one rooster.

20:08.500 --> 20:11.420
Scarcely enough
to feed his voracious appetite.

20:11.628 --> 20:15.966
And with all the roads
out of Gotham City blocked...

20:16.174 --> 20:18.593
...that leaves only one place.

20:21.471 --> 20:23.390
Are you some kind of nut or something?

20:23.598 --> 20:26.184
You can't come in here
and steal my eggs like this, bub.

20:26.393 --> 20:29.604
Mr. MacDonald, you should be
egg-xpressing your thanks...

20:29.813 --> 20:34.651
...that I saw fit to grace your ranch
with my presence. Ha, ha.

20:34.860 --> 20:39.531
Only the finest quality eggs will do
for my dietary practices.

20:39.740 --> 20:41.616
Besides, your prices are egg-xorbitant.

20:41.783 --> 20:44.327
I'll make you a good deal.
Better than wholesale.

20:44.536 --> 20:49.583
My good fellow, let me egg-xplain.
Egghead never pays for anything.

20:49.791 --> 20:52.627
It's just not done
among your finer class of criminals.

20:52.836 --> 20:58.258
Why, do you realize that if I paid one penny,
it would ruin my reputation among my peers?

20:58.467 --> 21:01.845
- It's almost dark, Egghead.
- Don't you think we better get going?

21:02.053 --> 21:05.223
Hey, how are we gonna get out of here?
They blocked off the airports.

21:05.432 --> 21:07.601
- And the roads.
-And the harbor.

21:07.809 --> 21:12.522
Well, since all of the overland routes
have been egg-xpunged...

21:12.731 --> 21:14.983
...the only way to go is underground.

21:15.317 --> 21:19.488
So let us explore
Gotham City's sewer system.

21:19.696 --> 21:24.451
- Just the right place for a rat like you.
-The only place you're going is up the river.

21:34.628 --> 21:36.922
Let's give them a taste
of our knuckles, shall we?

22:24.803 --> 22:25.846
Batman!

22:26.388 --> 22:28.515
Batman!

22:50.745 --> 22:54.541
All right, all right, that's all.

22:54.916 --> 22:57.127
Cease and desist.

22:57.335 --> 22:58.628
I'm done.

22:58.837 --> 23:00.463
Who's gonna pay for all my eggs?

23:00.672 --> 23:04.301
You'll be reimbursed, Mr. MacDonald,
at the current market rate.

23:04.509 --> 23:06.094
Woe is me.

23:06.303 --> 23:10.056
My criminal career is now egg-xtinct.

23:10.265 --> 23:12.601
Foolish evil man.

23:12.809 --> 23:15.645
You're going to end up
where all broken eggshells end up.

23:15.854 --> 23:16.897
In the garbage.

23:17.772 --> 23:19.357
Give me a break, Batman?

23:19.566 --> 23:23.737
You'll be dealt with fairly in a court of law.

23:24.821 --> 23:26.323
Miss Bacon.

23:26.531 --> 23:31.995
I'm puzzled why a girl of your obvious
breeding, education, style and class...

23:32.203 --> 23:36.666
...should have become involved
with someone like Egghead.

23:36.875 --> 23:39.628
I guess I'm just lucky, Batman.

23:43.173 --> 23:45.008
Is this the end of the book, Eggy-pooh?

23:45.425 --> 23:48.553
The end, period.

23:50.263 --> 23:53.058
I guess I laid an egg.

23:56.853 --> 23:59.940
Batman, we owe you a debt
that can never be repaid.

24:00.148 --> 24:03.234
Good city government is its own reward,
Commissioner Gordon.

24:03.443 --> 24:05.779
All the visiting criminals
have been apprehended...

24:05.987 --> 24:07.948
...by our stalwart police, Boy Wonder.

24:08.156 --> 24:11.493
The police of Gotham City
are the best anywhere.

24:11.701 --> 24:13.078
Our job is done.

24:13.286 --> 24:14.955
Come on, Robin.

24:18.708 --> 24:22.921
If you need us again, gentlemen,
we're as close as your Batphone.
