00:02.168 --> 00:03.635
<i>Previously on</i> Vampire Diaries:

00:03.803 --> 00:06.169
- You must be Elena.
- How do we look exactly alike?

00:06.339 --> 00:08.830
You're a doppelganger,
the key to breaking the curse.

00:09.009 --> 00:11.000
Klaus is a vampire
of werewolf bloodline.

00:11.177 --> 00:13.338
The curse has kept his werewolf
from manifesting.

00:13.513 --> 00:15.640
But if he breaks it, he'll be a true hybrid.

00:15.815 --> 00:18.477
Klaus wanted to deliver a message.
Sacrifice happens tonight.

00:18.651 --> 00:22.712
The ritual is straightforward. A witch will
channel the power of the full moon...

00:22.922 --> 00:25.322
...to release the spell
bound within the stone.

00:25.492 --> 00:28.325
After that, Klaus,
being both werewolf and vampire...

00:28.495 --> 00:30.793
...will sacrifice one of each.
- Where do I fit?

00:30.964 --> 00:33.899
Klaus must drink the blood
of the doppelganger to your death.

00:34.067 --> 00:35.796
- I can't lose you.
- You won't.

00:35.969 --> 00:37.903
- There is another way.
- Damon, no.

00:38.071 --> 00:40.733
You'll come back a vampire.
How could you take that choice?

00:40.940 --> 00:42.134
She'll never forgive you.

00:42.308 --> 00:45.334
A bite from a werewolf can kill
a vampire. Don't be his friend.

00:50.517 --> 00:51.643
Tyler?

00:51.818 --> 00:54.412
Without the werewolf,
he can't perform the ritual.

00:54.587 --> 00:56.646
First rule, always have backup.

00:56.823 --> 00:58.154
Backup werewolf.

00:58.324 --> 00:59.689
Backup vampire.

00:59.859 --> 01:00.917
She's in transition.

01:01.094 --> 01:02.755
- Why didn't he use me?
- He couldn't.

01:02.962 --> 01:05.055
- What is this, Damon?
- A werewolf bite.

01:09.569 --> 01:11.833
- Caroline, let me help.
- Get back, I got it.

01:21.014 --> 01:22.777
Caroline, the door's not gonna hold.

01:23.716 --> 01:25.240
- The bars!
- Tyler, please.

01:27.053 --> 01:29.783
Matt. No. Hey, no. It's Tyler.

01:29.989 --> 01:32.219
- He's trying to kill us.
- Wait.

01:33.860 --> 01:34.918
He's wounded.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.926
- Stay back.
- You can go around him.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.997
Are you nuts?

01:39.732 --> 01:41.996
You're not gonna shoot him again, okay?
Okay.

01:42.435 --> 01:44.494
- Matt, take my hand.
- I got it.

01:45.438 --> 01:47.065
Matt, take my hand.

01:52.545 --> 01:55.275
- That's what a werewolf bite looks like.
- Yep.

01:55.448 --> 01:57.712
It's not that bad.

01:57.884 --> 01:59.374
Will be.

01:59.552 --> 02:02.988
So that's it? You're just gonna die?

02:03.156 --> 02:05.886
Well, that depends.
You know anything about a cure?

02:06.526 --> 02:08.288
Me either.

02:12.398 --> 02:15.799
A hundred and 45 years
and no last goodbye?

02:15.969 --> 02:17.903
You don't get a goodbye.

02:18.071 --> 02:19.902
Don't... Don't leave mad.

02:20.073 --> 02:23.565
Us ending up on good terms is not
exactly on my bucket list, Katherine.

02:23.743 --> 02:27.304
Klaus made me call Jenna
to lure her out. I didn't have a choice.

02:27.480 --> 02:30.108
That's why I gave you the vervain.
So you had a choice.

02:30.283 --> 02:32.410
It was her or me. I chose her.

02:32.685 --> 02:34.482
I helped you. You owed me.

02:34.654 --> 02:38.488
When Klaus dies, you're gonna walk out
without a scratch and Elena's aunt dies.

02:38.658 --> 02:40.922
Somehow you're the only one that wins.

02:41.094 --> 02:42.152
How'd that happen?

02:43.129 --> 02:45.120
I didn't let love get in the way.

02:45.965 --> 02:49.059
Enjoy an eternity alone, Katherine.

02:50.069 --> 02:51.696
What are you gonna do?

02:52.805 --> 02:55.137
I'm gonna offer myself
as a replacement to Klaus.

02:55.308 --> 02:57.139
He won't take you.

02:57.310 --> 02:59.801
He saw your bite,
he said that your blood is impure.

03:00.513 --> 03:02.606
I'm sorry, Damon.

03:02.782 --> 03:05.842
But Jenna's dead.
There's nothing you can do about it.

03:10.590 --> 03:12.717
Oh, my head.

03:12.892 --> 03:14.154
What's wrong with me?

03:14.327 --> 03:17.990
- Do you remember what happened?
- You called me.

03:18.164 --> 03:20.189
You were so scared.

03:22.135 --> 03:24.535
I should have realized that it wasn't you.

03:25.371 --> 03:28.397
The second I walked out of the house,
someone grabbed me.

03:28.608 --> 03:29.700
A vampire.

03:29.876 --> 03:32.538
Klaus. It was Klaus.

03:32.712 --> 03:35.146
He made me drink his blood.

03:35.715 --> 03:40.379
And I don't remember anything
after that.

03:40.553 --> 03:42.487
Where are we? What happened?

03:42.655 --> 03:44.555
We're at the quarry.
He brought us here.

03:44.724 --> 03:46.487
Why don't I remember anything?

03:47.827 --> 03:50.227
Jenna, do you remember...

03:51.197 --> 03:54.064
...when I told you how someone
becomes a vampire?

03:54.234 --> 03:57.169
Yeah, if you die with vampire blood
in your system, it's...

03:59.572 --> 04:01.540
Oh, God.

04:02.575 --> 04:03.667
He killed me.

04:03.843 --> 04:07.574
Jenna, listen. Everything's going to be
okay. I'm gonna get you out of here.

04:07.747 --> 04:09.408
I'm a vampire?

04:11.184 --> 04:13.209
And I bet you're hungry.

04:27.367 --> 04:30.768
Don't bother trying to get through.
I spelled the circle.

04:31.271 --> 04:34.104
You're trapped,
no matter what you do.

04:34.274 --> 04:37.573
Greta, please just let her go.

04:41.981 --> 04:45.246
- Klaus chose her.
- No.

04:45.985 --> 04:47.646
Drink it.

04:47.820 --> 04:49.811
- Jenna, don't.
- I can't.

04:49.989 --> 04:51.957
Let her go. Hey.

04:55.595 --> 04:56.823
No.

04:57.930 --> 04:59.591
No.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.009
Jenna.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.006
It's gonna be okay.

05:20.119 --> 05:21.780
Hey.

05:24.657 --> 05:27.717
Jenna, hey, look at me.

05:28.294 --> 05:30.592
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

05:30.763 --> 05:32.025
Hey.

05:41.474 --> 05:43.465
This is useless.

05:43.643 --> 05:46.339
In all these Grimoires,
there has to be something...

05:46.512 --> 05:48.639
...to keep Elena
from becoming a vampire.

05:48.815 --> 05:50.680
And we'll keep looking.

05:50.850 --> 05:52.841
Until the last minute.

05:55.521 --> 05:58.649
The sacrifice is completed in stages
as the full moon sets.

05:58.825 --> 06:02.283
The werewolf is killed, then the vampire,
finally the doppelganger.

06:02.462 --> 06:04.828
Once Elena dies,
the curse will be broken.

06:04.997 --> 06:07.465
- Klaus will become hybrid.
- So when do we attack?

06:07.633 --> 06:10.227
Elena's death will activate
his dormant werewolf side.

06:10.403 --> 06:13.395
He'll be vulnerable during
the transformation. Bonnie comes in.

06:13.573 --> 06:15.370
You're sure Bonnie will survive this?

06:15.541 --> 06:18.510
If she can deliver him to the brink
of death, I'll finish the job myself.

06:20.646 --> 06:23.342
- Damon.
- Not gonna like what I'm about to say.

06:23.516 --> 06:26.007
Cut to the chase.
Is the sacrifice happening or not?

06:26.185 --> 06:30.849
It's happening. I tried to stop it,
but it got complicated.

06:31.023 --> 06:33.514
We're sticking with the plan.
We're meeting Bonnie.

06:33.693 --> 06:36.526
<i>- He's got Jenna, Stefan.</i>
- What?

06:36.696 --> 06:40.029
<i>He got Katherine</i>
<i>to lure her out of the house.</i>

06:41.033 --> 06:42.933
What is it? What's wrong?

06:43.102 --> 06:46.094
<i>He's going to use her</i>
<i>as the vampire in the ritual.</i>

06:46.305 --> 06:48.296
Oh, my God.

06:49.709 --> 06:53.008
- How are you feeling?
- I feel like myself.

06:53.546 --> 06:55.377
Only not.

06:56.082 --> 06:59.711
Everything is brighter. The fire's hotter.

07:01.087 --> 07:03.783
Part of me is terrified
but there's another part of me...

07:03.956 --> 07:05.719
...that doesn't wanna feel anything.

07:06.125 --> 07:09.185
Vampires can turn off the part
that's human.

07:09.762 --> 07:11.252
That's the part that hurts.

07:12.198 --> 07:15.690
- I'm gonna die, aren't I?
- No.

07:16.702 --> 07:20.433
Jenna, I'm not gonna let that happen.
I don't care what I have to do.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.934
- Who's that?
- That must be the werewolf.

07:29.882 --> 07:31.042
What's happening to me?

07:31.217 --> 07:34.118
I cast a spell
to slow down your transformation.

07:34.654 --> 07:38.556
Your insides are trying
to tear themselves free.

07:42.628 --> 07:45.722
Greta, witches are supposed
to maintain the balance in nature.

07:45.898 --> 07:48.298
It's your duty to them
to keep this curse sealed.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.232
My duty is to Klaus.

07:51.671 --> 07:53.798
The new order.

07:54.941 --> 07:57.501
Glad to know
I still have a dance partner.

08:01.247 --> 08:03.147
Hello, my lovelies.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.147
Are we ready?

08:05.952 --> 08:08.978
Come on. Get in here.

08:11.791 --> 08:14.123
- Do you see anything?
- We're not safe here.

08:14.794 --> 08:17.820
If that thing wants in, it's getting in.

08:20.199 --> 08:23.362
How did you even know what I was?

08:23.536 --> 08:25.026
I compelled you to forget.

08:25.671 --> 08:27.036
I was on vervain.

08:27.206 --> 08:29.800
I faked forgetting
so I could spy on you.

08:30.176 --> 08:33.009
- It was your mom's idea.
- Wait, my mom knows?

08:33.312 --> 08:35.472
Oh, my God. You told her.

08:36.048 --> 08:39.414
- Well, what'd she say?
- Your mom hates vampires.

08:40.019 --> 08:44.319
She grew up hating vampires
and she'll probably always hate vampires.

08:45.324 --> 08:47.349
- Well, what about you?
- What about me?

08:48.928 --> 08:50.691
Where does this leave us?

08:51.931 --> 08:53.364
Stuck in this house...

08:53.533 --> 08:56.001
...trying not to get mauled to death
by our friend.

09:00.706 --> 09:02.435
Heard you.

09:11.617 --> 09:13.016
Wow.

09:18.024 --> 09:20.720
Great. I was just thinking
about getting a bite to eat.

09:20.893 --> 09:24.056
Elena hasn't returned any of my calls
for days. I need to see her.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.255
You're a day late and a daughter short.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.932
- What are you talking about?
- Klaus has her.

09:29.101 --> 09:30.762
Sacrifice goes down tonight.

09:30.970 --> 09:33.837
How could you let that happen?
You were to keep her safe.

09:34.006 --> 09:36.736
Wasn't that the sum total of your plan,
to keep her safe?

09:36.909 --> 09:39.776
- She is safe. I fed her my blood.
- You what?

09:39.979 --> 09:42.539
When Klaus kills Elena,
she will come back to life.

09:42.715 --> 09:46.481
Granted, as the thing you hate most,
but no one really cares what you think.

09:50.189 --> 09:52.589
You do not wanna mess with me
right now.

09:52.758 --> 09:55.556
You ruined her life.
You know that, right?

09:55.728 --> 09:58.094
I know. I took her choice,
destroyed her future.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.356
Trust me, I get it.

10:01.033 --> 10:02.694
It actually gets worse.

10:03.069 --> 10:06.527
How could it possibly get any worse?

10:11.310 --> 10:13.938
I've got the moonstone.

10:14.880 --> 10:17.144
I spent 500 years looking for this.

10:19.518 --> 10:21.418
I hate to part with it.

10:26.892 --> 10:29.656
The moon has passed its apex.

10:30.329 --> 10:33.560
- Remember everything you need to do?
- I remember.

10:47.146 --> 10:49.239
Everything I did...

10:49.982 --> 10:51.973
I was just trying to help Tyler.

10:52.151 --> 10:53.618
Are you Jules?

10:54.353 --> 10:56.913
I didn't want him to be alone.

11:00.159 --> 11:01.490
Shall we?

11:35.728 --> 11:37.958
- Which one are you reading?
- Emily Bennett's.

11:38.164 --> 11:41.224
There's a section on spells she did
for Johnathan Gilbert.

11:41.567 --> 11:44.229
Yeah, I think she had a thing for him.

11:46.972 --> 11:49.964
There's something on
a resuscitative spell she was working on.

11:50.176 --> 11:53.612
I saw that too. She just didn't explain
what it did, exactly.

11:53.779 --> 11:56.247
Maybe Johnathan wrote about it
in his journals.

11:56.415 --> 11:57.780
You know,
I can have Stefan bring them.

11:59.185 --> 12:00.243
Someone's here.

12:05.491 --> 12:07.425
Hey, what are you doing here?

12:07.793 --> 12:11.752
Elijah and Stefan are upstairs.
You mind if I have a second with Jeremy?

12:11.931 --> 12:13.558
Sure, yeah. Of course.

12:18.971 --> 12:20.336
What's the matter?

12:20.706 --> 12:24.335
Jeremy, something's happened to Jenna.

12:27.713 --> 12:30.341
- Why did he take Jenna?
- A punishment for meddling.

12:30.516 --> 12:33.007
Klaus was gonna use Tyler and Caroline.

12:33.219 --> 12:36.154
- Damon rescued them.
- Then we need to go. Now.

12:36.322 --> 12:38.654
Before Jenna's been sacrificed.
I can kill Klaus.

12:38.824 --> 12:41.452
Bonnie, if you use that much power,
you'll be dead.

12:41.627 --> 12:44.289
We've already been through this.
It's not an option.

12:44.597 --> 12:48.761
- Neither is letting Jenna die.
- Stefan would agree with you.

12:50.803 --> 12:53.465
We're gonna offer another vampire.

12:53.806 --> 12:55.239
One that he'll want more.

12:57.243 --> 12:58.335
Me.

13:09.889 --> 13:11.652
Does that mean it's working?

13:12.792 --> 13:14.282
It's working.

13:19.331 --> 13:22.198
The day the lawyers called to tell me
I was your guardian...

13:22.368 --> 13:24.700
...you know what my first thought was?

13:25.571 --> 13:28.506
"Isn't there someone else
who can do this?"

13:28.674 --> 13:32.166
There was no one who could have gotten
me and Jeremy through all of that.

13:32.344 --> 13:35.472
Just the thought that I almost passed up
taking care of you.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.377
But you didn't.

13:37.550 --> 13:40.781
You put your entire life on hold
to help us.

13:41.420 --> 13:43.888
Look around, Elena.

13:45.224 --> 13:48.318
- I failed you.
- No, you didn't.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.189
I failed you.

13:53.365 --> 13:55.094
I'm so sorry.

13:57.503 --> 14:01.371
Listen, being a vampire,
it intensifies your guilt.

14:01.540 --> 14:04.202
But it also makes you stronger
and faster.

14:04.610 --> 14:06.578
You can fight back.

14:06.745 --> 14:10.875
I'm gonna get through this. I'll be okay.
I need you to believe that.

14:11.884 --> 14:13.909
But promise me...

14:14.386 --> 14:16.513
...when you get the chance...

14:18.858 --> 14:20.382
...run.

14:24.830 --> 14:27.458
- You don't think I killed him, do you?
- No.

14:28.033 --> 14:31.332
No, it takes a lot more
than wooden bullets to kill a werewolf.

14:32.972 --> 14:36.339
He's still out there somewhere.

14:39.745 --> 14:41.940
Do you think my mom wants to kill me?

14:43.649 --> 14:45.981
I don't think your mom knows
what to do with you.

14:46.151 --> 14:49.086
Yeah, well, I don't really know
what to do with me either.

14:52.458 --> 14:55.450
- What is it?
- Wait.

14:56.929 --> 14:59.124
No. Don't. Don't shoot.

14:59.298 --> 15:01.232
What the hell are you doing?

15:04.970 --> 15:06.403
- Give me your jacket.
- What?

15:06.572 --> 15:08.631
Your jacket, take it off.

15:16.315 --> 15:17.407
Hey.

15:18.117 --> 15:19.311
Hey.

15:23.122 --> 15:24.987
Caroline?

15:30.496 --> 15:32.930
Hey, it's okay.

15:33.098 --> 15:34.395
It's okay.

15:39.638 --> 15:43.096
Bonnie did the locator spell.
They're at Stevens Quarry.

15:43.275 --> 15:45.266
I'll head over, you'll follow with Bonnie.

15:45.444 --> 15:49.039
Just as the moon hits its final phase.
She's to stay hidden until then.

15:49.214 --> 15:50.943
He cannot know that she's alive.

15:54.987 --> 15:56.852
You're very honorable.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.284
Are you?

16:06.231 --> 16:08.859
Because this whole plan is...

16:09.702 --> 16:12.068
It's contingent upon your honor, Elijah.

16:13.472 --> 16:15.064
I won't fail you.

16:16.008 --> 16:18.135
Klaus is your brother.

16:18.844 --> 16:24.043
I know I've wanted to kill my brother
a thousand times.

16:24.717 --> 16:25.877
I've never been able to.

16:26.485 --> 16:28.510
Well, Klaus was not my only brother.

16:30.356 --> 16:34.258
I had siblings. Parents. I had a family.

16:34.727 --> 16:37.696
Over the centuries,
Klaus hunted them down one by one...

16:37.863 --> 16:39.728
...and he took them from me.

16:41.767 --> 16:45.225
He scattered them across the seas
where their bodies could not be found.

16:47.339 --> 16:49.000
You want revenge.

16:51.410 --> 16:54.277
Sometimes there's honor in revenge,
Stefan.

16:57.383 --> 16:59.681
I won't fail you.

17:02.054 --> 17:04.079
Please end this.

17:15.601 --> 17:18.069
I brought the Gilbert journals.

17:18.237 --> 17:20.432
I think I know the spell
you're talking about.

17:20.606 --> 17:23.632
- Where's Damon?
- Upstairs. Alaric wanted to talk to him.

17:25.277 --> 17:27.676
- He did what?
- He wasn't gonna let Jenna die.

17:29.415 --> 17:34.682
We have a witch. She kills Klaus.
No one has to die.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.252
Except for Bonnie.

17:37.189 --> 17:38.781
God, Stefan, damn it.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.421
Hey, are you okay?

17:46.598 --> 17:48.463
I'm fine.

17:50.536 --> 17:55.496
Well, that's my brother for you.
Always cleaning up my messes.

18:04.683 --> 18:05.980
Hello, Jenna.

18:09.421 --> 18:12.413
Let her go. I understand
that I have to die, but she doesn't...

18:13.859 --> 18:15.793
- Careful.
- Elena, don't.

18:15.961 --> 18:19.328
No, Jenna.
We can't leave Jeremy without a family.

18:19.932 --> 18:23.663
I followed your rules, I did everything
that you asked. I didn't run.

18:23.836 --> 18:25.497
Please?

18:29.808 --> 18:31.571
Well, well.

18:33.712 --> 18:36.510
I don't recall you being on the guest list.

18:41.253 --> 18:43.517
I'm here to talk.

18:47.192 --> 18:49.217
Very well, then.

18:50.362 --> 18:53.331
What can I do for you, Mr. Salvatore?

18:55.834 --> 18:57.597
We found something in the journals.

18:57.769 --> 19:01.068
Johnathan journaled the story
of a mother who called on Emily.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.071
The woman's baby was sick, dying.

19:03.509 --> 19:07.104
Emily cast a spell that would bind
the woman's life force with her child.

19:07.279 --> 19:08.940
Skip to the "save Elena" part.

19:09.114 --> 19:12.277
The child died, but the mother's
life force flowed through her...

19:12.484 --> 19:13.917
...restoring her to life.

19:14.086 --> 19:17.715
We already know Elena's gonna come
back to life. She'll be a vampire.

19:17.890 --> 19:21.087
- Not if her soul remains intact.
- Her soul, really?

19:21.994 --> 19:25.623
You're gonna put your faith
in some "act of God" mumbo jumbo?

19:28.133 --> 19:33.070
I refuse to let Elena become the thing
I've spent my life protecting her against.

19:33.238 --> 19:36.799
And you can call that God or mystical
energy, whatever you want, but, yes.

19:39.211 --> 19:41.509
I'm putting my faith in it.

19:45.951 --> 19:48.579
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

19:50.255 --> 19:52.155
You can hear them.

19:53.325 --> 19:55.759
You can hear anything.
Just focus on them.

19:58.597 --> 20:00.792
You don't need to kill Jenna.

20:01.533 --> 20:02.932
I'll take her place.

20:03.969 --> 20:05.994
Oh, I don't know.

20:06.171 --> 20:09.937
I rather appreciate the symmetry
of three women...

20:10.475 --> 20:15.174
...three goddesses
sacrificed at nature's altar.

20:15.347 --> 20:16.439
What are they saying?

20:17.316 --> 20:18.408
I can't make it out.

20:18.951 --> 20:21.943
You can do this. Just relax. Focus.

20:23.088 --> 20:25.556
Don't play games with me.
You'll get what you want.

20:26.491 --> 20:29.255
I can hear him. I hear Stefan.

20:29.695 --> 20:30.787
What are they saying?

20:30.963 --> 20:34.160
You're quite the hero, aren't you?

20:34.333 --> 20:38.030
- Yeah, I've heard that about you.
- Just make the trade.

20:38.203 --> 20:39.363
Me for Jenna.

20:39.571 --> 20:40.697
Oh, my God.

20:40.872 --> 20:42.203
What is it?

20:46.278 --> 20:48.269
He wants to take my place.

21:09.501 --> 21:12.664
- How's Tyler doing?
- Sleeping.

21:12.838 --> 21:14.897
He should be better by morning.
He just...

21:15.073 --> 21:17.303
He needs some rest.

21:17.709 --> 21:19.370
Good.

21:22.848 --> 21:24.406
So this is your life now, huh?

21:24.583 --> 21:26.642
Never a dull moment.

21:31.156 --> 21:36.651
You know, these last few days with you
have been so great, and fun, and...

21:37.696 --> 21:38.924
So Caroline.

21:41.533 --> 21:45.333
I thought that I might be able
to get past this whole vampire thing.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.398
But you can.

21:48.940 --> 21:52.603
- Matt...
- I don't know if I can, Caroline.

21:52.811 --> 21:53.869
Matt.

21:58.216 --> 22:01.014
I get it. This is your life now.

22:01.186 --> 22:03.347
But you know what my life is, Car?

22:03.522 --> 22:05.547
My life is an absentee mom.

22:07.025 --> 22:10.688
And a bunch of bills to pay,
and school...

22:10.862 --> 22:14.389
...and a job, and it sucks sometimes.

22:14.733 --> 22:16.826
But it's my life.

22:20.472 --> 22:23.737
And I think that I just wanna live it
without all of this.

22:34.286 --> 22:36.846
Come on, Bonnie,
we got a hybrid to kill.

22:39.491 --> 22:41.391
- It's done.
- That's it?

22:42.160 --> 22:43.889
Let's go.

22:44.896 --> 22:47.990
- I'll be back soon.
- Wait, what do you mean?

22:48.800 --> 22:51.928
I'm coming. I need to be there.
I need to make sure you are okay.

22:52.104 --> 22:54.664
- Who's gonna make sure you're okay?
- I've got my ring.

22:54.873 --> 22:57.273
Look, I'm not taking no for an answer.

23:06.651 --> 23:08.414
Easy. Easy.

23:11.123 --> 23:12.988
Just go. I'll stay with him.

23:19.498 --> 23:21.159
It's time.

23:21.333 --> 23:24.894
- I got the weapons in the car.
- Bonnie's the only weapon we need.

23:27.005 --> 23:29.371
Bonnie, what is this?

23:29.541 --> 23:32.635
- I can't put anyone at risk.
- I can't stay with Jenna out there.

23:32.811 --> 23:35.609
- I'm sorry.
- You can't do this. Damon?

23:35.781 --> 23:38.011
Sorry, buddy. She's right.

23:38.183 --> 23:41.414
No. You can't do this. Bonnie.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.820
Bonnie!

23:45.190 --> 23:47.556
- Elena...
- I have to do something.

23:47.726 --> 23:50.388
This can't happen. None of it.

23:50.562 --> 23:52.052
Quite the predicament.

23:53.432 --> 23:56.401
You know, it's funny,
all this talk about preserving family...

23:56.568 --> 24:00.129
...and here's Stefan, granting your wish.

24:00.539 --> 24:01.631
Stefan.

24:02.541 --> 24:03.940
It's okay.

24:04.476 --> 24:05.966
Well...

24:06.845 --> 24:08.176
...who's it gonna be, Elena?

24:09.214 --> 24:10.442
No.

24:11.249 --> 24:13.217
Oh, don't worry.

24:13.518 --> 24:14.849
There's actually no choice.

24:16.221 --> 24:17.950
No. Stefan.

24:19.257 --> 24:21.020
No.

24:24.729 --> 24:28.256
I have other plans for your boyfriend.

24:28.567 --> 24:30.398
I want him alive.

24:31.703 --> 24:33.193
But for now...

24:39.110 --> 24:40.600
Whenever you're ready, Greta.

24:47.486 --> 24:48.748
No.

24:48.920 --> 24:50.911
- Your turn.
- No, Jenna, no.

24:52.924 --> 24:56.690
It's all right, Elena.
I know what I have to do.

25:10.542 --> 25:12.066
Jenna, no.

25:21.953 --> 25:23.545
Just turn it off.

25:24.256 --> 25:27.248
Jenna, turn it off.

25:27.926 --> 25:30.019
You won't be scared anymore.

25:39.571 --> 25:40.731
No!

25:40.906 --> 25:42.237
Jenna!

25:47.045 --> 25:49.479
No, Jenna.

26:26.251 --> 26:27.445
No.

26:40.765 --> 26:42.198
I'm so sorry.

26:42.901 --> 26:43.993
Shh.

26:45.804 --> 26:47.795
Are they gonna kill him?

26:49.174 --> 26:50.402
Yes.

26:58.850 --> 27:00.681
It's time.

27:32.417 --> 27:34.578
Thank you, Elena.

27:35.120 --> 27:36.849
Go to hell.

27:46.197 --> 27:47.323
No.

28:31.443 --> 28:33.377
I can feel it.

28:34.813 --> 28:36.906
It's happening.

28:47.092 --> 28:49.890
Yes, yes.

29:11.816 --> 29:15.013
No. You were dead.

29:30.702 --> 29:32.363
Elena.

29:39.177 --> 29:41.668
- I need you to get her out of here.
- What about you?

29:42.480 --> 29:46.177
I'm not leaving until he's dead. Go.

30:06.971 --> 30:08.029
Elijah?

30:08.540 --> 30:10.098
Hello, brother.

30:18.983 --> 30:21.850
In the name of our family, Niklaus.

30:22.554 --> 30:24.112
I didn't bury them at sea.

30:25.356 --> 30:28.621
- What?
- Their bodies are safe.

30:30.728 --> 30:33.629
If you kill me, you'll never find them.

30:33.798 --> 30:35.390
Elijah.

30:35.733 --> 30:36.791
Don't listen to him.

30:37.001 --> 30:40.232
Elijah, I can take you to them.

30:41.606 --> 30:44.905
I give you my word, brother.

30:47.212 --> 30:49.544
- Do it and I'll take you both out.
- You'll die.

30:49.714 --> 30:51.579
I don't care.

30:53.718 --> 30:54.878
Brother.

30:58.323 --> 30:59.881
- I'm sorry.
- No.

31:00.058 --> 31:01.286
No.

31:23.948 --> 31:26.439
We should have heard from them
by now.

31:27.685 --> 31:29.653
Did you read all this?

31:31.389 --> 31:32.481
I did.

31:32.657 --> 31:34.818
You understand
what happened to the mother...

31:34.993 --> 31:37.325
...after the baby
was brought back to life.

31:37.495 --> 31:39.895
She saved her daughter.

31:40.531 --> 31:42.465
She found peace.

31:42.634 --> 31:44.363
John...

31:50.875 --> 31:53.400
I need you to give this to Elena for me.

31:55.847 --> 31:57.747
And also this.

31:58.483 --> 32:01.008
Oh, hey, what's going on here?

32:06.758 --> 32:08.988
Take care of each other.

32:09.193 --> 32:10.922
Please.

32:15.133 --> 32:16.896
I think they're here.

32:26.010 --> 32:29.878
Come back as a vampire,
I'll stake you myself. So don't.

32:36.154 --> 32:39.089
Because I can't stand the idea of you
hating me forever.

32:41.292 --> 32:42.520
How is she?

32:42.927 --> 32:44.087
I don't know yet.

32:45.563 --> 32:47.588
What about Jenna?

32:51.269 --> 32:53.066
No.

32:53.771 --> 32:55.398
I'm sorry, Jeremy.

33:30.508 --> 33:32.772
- Elena.
- Hey.

33:35.013 --> 33:37.243
Damon, I...

33:37.415 --> 33:38.609
How do you feel?

33:39.951 --> 33:41.714
I feel fine.

34:11.616 --> 34:13.914
- Hey.
- Oh.

34:14.252 --> 34:17.244
Yeah, you got shot.

34:18.489 --> 34:19.683
But it's healing.

34:29.333 --> 34:30.857
You were right.

34:33.004 --> 34:34.335
I shouldn't have come home.

34:34.871 --> 34:36.965
No, you just...

34:37.208 --> 34:39.266
You should have never left.

34:41.813 --> 34:43.906
And you shouldn't leave again.

34:44.482 --> 34:45.880
You're kidding, right?

34:47.985 --> 34:50.215
This is the second time
I've tried to kill you.

34:50.388 --> 34:53.915
Well, no friendship is perfect.

34:58.229 --> 35:01.665
Matt broke up with me.

35:05.236 --> 35:06.328
I'm sorry.

35:06.504 --> 35:13.239
Yeah, well, you know, instead of just
bailing on me again, you could just say:

35:14.378 --> 35:17.779
"Thank you, Caroline,
for taking care of me.

35:17.949 --> 35:21.680
And I'm sorry that I tried
to chow down on you again."

35:30.228 --> 35:31.855
Hey.

35:32.029 --> 35:33.587
Hey.

35:34.432 --> 35:35.956
Come here.

35:40.071 --> 35:42.335
Oh, easy.

35:46.978 --> 35:49.105
Thank you, Caroline...

35:49.647 --> 35:51.842
...for taking care of me.

35:54.852 --> 35:56.979
You're welcome.

35:58.222 --> 35:59.280
<i>We all set?</i>

35:59.457 --> 36:02.790
Yeah. Plenty of room
at the Gilbert family plot...

36:02.960 --> 36:06.452
...and I compelled two of
the grave diggers to do the dirty work.

36:06.631 --> 36:07.928
How's she doing?

36:08.766 --> 36:11.360
She lost the only parents she had.

36:11.736 --> 36:13.431
She's in shock.

36:39.397 --> 36:42.127
- I'm almost ready.
- Yeah, take your time.

36:47.838 --> 36:50.398
John wanted me to give you this.

36:56.814 --> 36:58.179
And this.

37:11.796 --> 37:13.696
Jeremy.

37:17.001 --> 37:18.491
I'm so sorry.

37:24.575 --> 37:28.341
I'm so sorry
that you've lost so many people.

37:31.349 --> 37:33.044
I still have you.

38:23.067 --> 38:24.591
<i>Elena...</i>

38:25.269 --> 38:30.036
<i>...it's no easy task being an ordinary</i>
<i>parent to an extraordinary child.</i>

38:30.574 --> 38:33.008
<i>I failed in that task.</i>

38:34.145 --> 38:37.808
<i>And because of my prejudices,</i>
<i>I failed you.</i>

38:40.284 --> 38:42.752
<i>I'm haunted by how things</i>
<i>might have played out...</i>

38:42.920 --> 38:46.253
<i>...if I'd been more willing</i>
<i>to hear your side of things.</i>

38:48.759 --> 38:51.557
<i>For me, it's the end.</i>

38:51.762 --> 38:54.925
<i>For you, a chance to grow old</i>
<i>and someday do better...</i>

38:55.099 --> 38:57.294
<i>...with your own child</i>
<i>than I did with mine.</i>

38:58.736 --> 39:02.331
<i>It's for that child</i>
<i>that I give you my ring.</i>

39:17.421 --> 39:22.120
<i>I don't ask for your forgiveness</i>
<i>or for you to forget.</i>

39:23.494 --> 39:26.327
<i>I ask only that you believe this.</i>

39:36.974 --> 39:40.501
<i>Whether you are now reading this</i>
<i>as a human or as a vampire...</i>

39:41.145 --> 39:43.272
<i>...I love you all the same.</i>

39:43.447 --> 39:47.611
<i>As I've always loved you</i>
<i>and always will.</i>

39:49.086 --> 39:50.212
<i>John.</i>

40:18.149 --> 40:20.481
I'm gonna head back to the house.

40:21.185 --> 40:24.712
I think I'll skip the coffee
and tea cakes.

40:25.189 --> 40:27.589
Damon, she needs us right now.

40:27.758 --> 40:29.248
All of us.

40:29.627 --> 40:32.152
And then what's the plan, Stefan?

40:33.264 --> 40:34.492
The curse is broken.

40:34.999 --> 40:39.060
How does one go about killing
an all-powerful wolf-vamp...

40:39.236 --> 40:41.033
...and his two-faced older brother?

40:41.205 --> 40:42.763
I have no idea.

40:42.940 --> 40:46.205
We need to get an idea. Fast.

40:46.377 --> 40:48.572
I'm not gonna let Elena lose
anybody else.

40:48.746 --> 40:50.179
I wouldn't make any promises.

40:50.347 --> 40:53.180
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Tyler Lockwood bit me.

40:56.287 --> 41:01.020
It's actually more of a nip, really,
but there it is.

41:09.533 --> 41:11.558
We'll find something.

41:13.270 --> 41:14.635
A cure.

41:14.805 --> 41:16.966
There's no cure, Stefan.

41:19.743 --> 41:22.473
We kept Elena human, right?

41:22.680 --> 41:25.080
We found the way
when there was no way.

41:25.249 --> 41:26.716
Hey.

41:28.252 --> 41:30.186
I will do this.

41:30.788 --> 41:33.985
You wanna do something for me?
Keep this from Elena.

41:34.191 --> 41:37.058
Last thing she needs
is another grave to mourn.
