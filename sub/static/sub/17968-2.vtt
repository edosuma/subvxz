00:01.676 --> 00:03.142
Hello.

00:03.228 --> 00:06.095
We would love to use our
free passes to see one movie

00:06.181 --> 00:07.930
and only one movie.

00:08.016 --> 00:10.399
- Um, we're gonna see...
- "Fang for a fang."

00:10.435 --> 00:11.734
Gotta support book adaptations.

00:13.438 --> 00:14.937
- You read the book?
- No.

00:15.023 --> 00:16.405
Thank you.

00:16.441 --> 00:18.107
Okay. Have a good rest.

00:18.159 --> 00:19.742
<i>(Man) Gun it, bitch, without that cocaine,</i>

00:19.777 --> 00:21.744
<i>I can't control the other werewolves.</i>

00:21.779 --> 00:24.614
Um, I'm confused.

00:24.699 --> 00:26.999
Chris Rock is killing all the werewolves,

00:27.085 --> 00:29.702
but he is also a werewolf.

00:29.787 --> 00:31.087
This movie makes no sense.

00:31.122 --> 00:32.338
I love it.

00:36.961 --> 00:40.096
<i>(Woman) I don't care what the
principal says, I'm in love with you.</i>

00:40.131 --> 00:41.464
Did you bring any more almond milk?

00:41.549 --> 00:43.466
- (Chair thumping)
- Yeah, I just...

00:43.518 --> 00:44.684
- Ow.
- Shush!

00:44.769 --> 00:47.303
- I'm just trying...
- Shh!

00:47.388 --> 00:48.804
I'm just trying...

00:48.857 --> 00:50.223
(Muttering)

00:54.479 --> 00:56.145
Do you want any popcorn?

00:56.197 --> 00:58.531
There's milk duds on the bottom, actually.

00:58.616 --> 00:59.982
All right, yeah.

01:00.034 --> 01:01.450
My favorite.

01:03.821 --> 01:05.538
Ilana...

01:05.623 --> 01:07.490
Are you (Bleep) kidding me?

01:10.795 --> 01:11.744
That's not cool dude.

01:12.997 --> 01:15.498
Hello, sir, we'd like
to report that the sound

01:15.550 --> 01:17.500
was really subpar.

01:17.585 --> 01:19.719
The dolby was nowhere near 5.1...

01:19.804 --> 01:21.671
Great, okay.

01:21.756 --> 01:23.172
See you next week.

Hi, Abbi-Dabbi.

01:41.526 --> 01:42.742
Smells like you've been working out.

01:42.827 --> 01:43.776
What is this?

01:43.861 --> 01:46.579
I have been making some home improvements.

01:46.664 --> 01:47.747
This way we don't have to trudge

01:47.832 --> 01:50.082
all the way to the master fridge.

01:51.169 --> 01:52.868
Watch.

01:52.921 --> 01:55.504
- It's like two feet farther.
- Simple.

01:55.540 --> 01:57.039
I don't think this is a good idea.

01:57.125 --> 01:58.207
Elegant.

01:58.259 --> 01:59.592
Bevers, do you want me to get it?

01:59.677 --> 02:02.011
It's heavy.

02:02.046 --> 02:06.182
- It's clearly gonna... the floor.
- Oh, (Bleep).

02:07.719 --> 02:09.018
I'm sorry.

02:09.053 --> 02:11.437
I guess I don't know my own strength.

02:11.522 --> 02:13.139
Holy (Bleep).

02:13.224 --> 02:15.224
Bevers, what is on your back?

02:15.310 --> 02:16.892
You know, I don't know.

02:16.945 --> 02:20.646
I just know it itches a
lot, and it really hurts.

02:20.732 --> 02:22.064
Is it a mosquito bite?

02:22.150 --> 02:24.617
No, that is definitely not a mosquito bite.

02:24.702 --> 02:26.485
I think it's a bed sore.

02:26.571 --> 02:28.571
I've only been sitting on
the couch... so, technically,

02:28.623 --> 02:30.406
you're gonna have to call
it a couch sore, but...

02:30.491 --> 02:33.793
How have you been on my couch
long enough to get a couch sore?

02:33.878 --> 02:36.379
You don't even live here,
your girlfriend does.

02:37.915 --> 02:38.831
Where's Melody?

02:38.916 --> 02:40.416
You just missed her.

02:40.501 --> 02:42.335
She's on her way to
Port-Au-Prince right now.

02:42.420 --> 02:44.220
Of course she is. She
leaves her boyfriend here

02:44.255 --> 02:46.172
to go on, what, some (Bleep) cruise?

02:46.257 --> 02:47.590
Uh, no.

02:47.642 --> 02:50.309
She's spearheading Habitat
For Humanity down there.

02:50.395 --> 02:53.229
I know everybody else has
moved on to the new hip tragedy,

02:53.264 --> 02:55.598
but it's still a mess down in Haiti.

02:55.683 --> 02:57.266
I know it is.

02:57.318 --> 02:58.934
Terrible.

02:59.020 --> 03:00.436
You need to get off of my couch.

03:02.023 --> 03:05.908
You need to take a long hard
look at yourself right now.

03:05.943 --> 03:08.661
This is so disgusting.

03:08.746 --> 03:09.779
Just do something with your life.

03:09.831 --> 03:11.197
Do anything.

03:11.282 --> 03:12.448
Jesus.

03:12.533 --> 03:14.500
I can't... I can't do this, Bevers.

03:16.838 --> 03:17.787
Ow.

03:17.839 --> 03:18.838
Please stop.

03:18.923 --> 03:21.791
I'm trying to be all zen Buddha, you know?

03:21.843 --> 03:22.875
Tea.

03:22.960 --> 03:24.126
Hey, Nicole.

03:24.212 --> 03:25.961
Nic, Nic, Nic.

03:26.047 --> 03:28.347
Do you ever, um, get hair from your head

03:28.433 --> 03:29.632
stuck in your butt crack in the shower?

03:29.684 --> 03:30.800
Do you?

03:30.852 --> 03:32.718
- Ilana?
- Hey, buddy, what's up?

03:32.804 --> 03:37.189
My therapist has encouraged
me to write down my feelings.

03:37.275 --> 03:39.108
I didn't know you go to
a therapist... me, too.

03:39.143 --> 03:43.312
"Dear Ilana, when you do not do work,

03:43.398 --> 03:47.817
I feel disrespected and..."

03:47.869 --> 03:49.735
- I had no idea.
- "And less then."

03:49.821 --> 03:54.290
"I will be out for the rest
of the day, and when I return,

03:54.325 --> 03:57.376
you... you need to have gotten a deal,

03:57.462 --> 04:00.212
or I will have to...

04:00.298 --> 04:02.665
let you go.

04:02.750 --> 04:04.967
Very sincerely, Todd."

04:08.756 --> 04:11.257
You know what?

04:11.342 --> 04:12.842
Challenge accepted.

04:12.894 --> 04:14.226
Okay? I'm proud of you.

04:14.312 --> 04:15.895
That was great. Yeah, I'll do it,

04:15.980 --> 04:17.730
- I'll work.

what it is we "do" at this "company."?

05:47.205 --> 05:49.205
Todd told you to work.

05:49.291 --> 05:51.074
I am, Nicoletta.

05:51.159 --> 05:52.709
I'm hiring interns.

05:52.794 --> 05:54.828
Yeah, two words, baby.

05:54.913 --> 05:58.715
Steve Jobs... techno-visionary,

05:58.800 --> 06:01.584
created many jobs.

06:01.670 --> 06:03.086
Oh, okay.

06:03.171 --> 06:04.003
See you later.

06:05.974 --> 06:07.307
Wow, wow, wow.

06:07.342 --> 06:10.226
This is an incredible resume.

06:10.312 --> 06:12.979
Did you print this yourself?

06:13.014 --> 06:15.348
Yeah, you just, uh, press "Ctrl P."

06:15.400 --> 06:18.818
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

06:18.854 --> 06:22.989
My biggest weakness is
that I lose my purse a lot.

06:23.024 --> 06:25.241
But then my biggest strength
is that I always get it back.

06:26.361 --> 06:27.610
Does that answer your question?

06:27.696 --> 06:32.115
You asked me the question, and then
just started answering it yourself.

06:32.200 --> 06:33.950
Excellent listening skills.

06:34.035 --> 06:35.502
I've been taking the
path train into Manhattan

06:35.537 --> 06:38.171
every morning... not great
for my thigh bursitis.

06:38.206 --> 06:40.874
But on the bright side,
my kids sure are happy

06:40.926 --> 06:42.258
to have me out of the house.

06:42.344 --> 06:43.710
Gotta tell you, Frank,

06:43.795 --> 06:47.597
this would absolutely be a pity hire.

06:49.017 --> 06:50.383
That would be amazing.

06:50.469 --> 06:54.104
I just don't think you're
deals deals deals material.

06:54.189 --> 06:55.522
I already work here.

06:56.892 --> 06:58.975
Stop letting strangers in the building.

06:59.060 --> 07:00.560
Sorry about that.

07:02.948 --> 07:05.115
Oh, you missed the... all right.

07:07.452 --> 07:08.735
What up, Trey?

07:08.787 --> 07:10.036
So much better.

07:10.071 --> 07:11.204
Thank you for asking.

07:11.239 --> 07:13.239
You know I have been in such a funk lately,

07:13.325 --> 07:15.708
'cause you know I donated
$14,000 to Zach Braff's

07:15.744 --> 07:18.711
- Kick-starter, and...
- Fourteen thousand dollars?

07:18.747 --> 07:20.413
I mean that's a lot of money.

07:20.499 --> 07:23.082
Yeah, my whole savings, but
it was worth every penny.

07:23.135 --> 07:26.002
The bummer is that they spelled
my name wrong in the credits,

07:26.087 --> 07:28.087
and I didn't get my set visit.

07:28.140 --> 07:29.923
But, you know what, today is a new day.

07:29.975 --> 07:31.558
Cha-chinga!

07:31.593 --> 07:34.060
Yeah, you know what, I'm in
a really good mood today, too.

07:34.095 --> 07:36.095
Today is a che-chinga.

07:36.148 --> 07:38.314
It's "cha-chinga." But that's great.

07:38.400 --> 07:39.766
Our cycles must be synched.

07:39.818 --> 07:41.518
Our... our happiness cycles.

07:41.603 --> 07:45.155
Yeah, you're normally so
sad and sickly and depressed,

07:45.240 --> 07:47.490
but today you're rocking positive vibes.

07:47.576 --> 07:49.325
All you, buddy. All you, all you.

07:49.411 --> 07:50.527
Nice work, brother.

07:50.612 --> 07:52.278
You know what, I do feel like my vibes

07:52.330 --> 07:54.781
are like off the chain today.

07:54.833 --> 07:59.118
You know what, you seem ready to
rise up and meet an opportunity.

07:59.204 --> 08:01.171
Would you like to assist me today?

08:01.256 --> 08:02.455
I would love to.

08:02.507 --> 08:04.457
- Rock on, garth let's party.
- Yeah, let's rock it.

08:04.543 --> 08:05.458
And guess what?

08:05.544 --> 08:07.260
I found my muse.

08:10.131 --> 08:11.097
Hey, Abbi.

08:12.634 --> 08:14.467
Bevers.

08:16.831 --> 08:17.447
You guys know each other?

08:17.517 --> 08:19.433
- You two boyfriend-girlfriend?
- God, no.

08:19.519 --> 08:20.735
He's my roommate's boyfriend.

08:20.820 --> 08:21.769
So, you know his body.

08:21.854 --> 08:23.154
This is great.

08:23.189 --> 08:25.239
I could use an extra hand,
because I'm documenting

08:25.325 --> 08:28.659
his transformation for
bodybytrey.biz, my website.

08:28.695 --> 08:29.911
Will you help me train him?

08:29.996 --> 08:33.447
- Yeah, I'll help you train Bevers.
- Great.

08:33.533 --> 08:34.782
Give me five more minutes
on that elliptical,

08:34.866 --> 08:35.783
then Abbi will stretch you out.

08:35.868 --> 08:37.168
Thumbs up.

08:37.203 --> 08:38.869
He's incredible.

08:38.955 --> 08:41.205
All right, I'm gonna go grab
my Lumia and take some pics.

08:41.291 --> 08:44.292
He is the perfect "before" picture.

08:44.377 --> 08:46.544
A lump of clay we're gonna
sculpt together, Abbi.

08:46.596 --> 08:47.545
Okay.

08:47.630 --> 08:48.763
He's gonna be my garden state.

08:49.966 --> 08:51.515
- (Slap)
- Okay.

08:51.551 --> 08:52.767
Kinda inappropriate.

08:57.140 --> 08:59.056
Wow.

08:59.108 --> 09:00.524
- Ilana?
- Yes?

09:00.560 --> 09:01.726
This is Todd's desk.

09:01.811 --> 09:03.144
Yes, mhm.

09:03.229 --> 09:05.780
And I thought you were hiring one intern.

09:05.865 --> 09:09.233
I know, but look at the diversity
I'm bringing to this company.

09:09.319 --> 09:10.818
Frank lives in Hoboken.

09:10.903 --> 09:13.237
He's a modern-day gypsy.

09:13.323 --> 09:15.656
And, hey, the company can afford it.

09:15.742 --> 09:17.408
Because you're not paying them.

09:17.460 --> 09:19.076
Exactly.

09:19.162 --> 09:22.713
You and I are seriously like
mind meld, on the same page.

09:22.782 --> 09:24.248
You gotta check this out, too.

09:24.300 --> 09:26.717
These are dinosaurs, stills of dinosaurs.

09:26.753 --> 09:28.719
They're made of the same
thing stars are made of,

09:28.755 --> 09:29.754
which is what we are made of...

09:29.806 --> 09:32.173
(Phone vibrating)

09:34.093 --> 09:35.259
Do we have to keep doing this?

09:35.345 --> 09:36.677
It's the three in the middle.

09:36.763 --> 09:37.812
I keep telling you that.

09:37.897 --> 09:40.097
You were attacked in broad daylight.

09:40.149 --> 09:42.316
We have to make sure this
gang doesn't hit anybody else.

09:44.153 --> 09:47.021
Okay, number four, please
step forward, say your line.

09:49.108 --> 09:51.409
Nice razor scooter, pencil dick.

09:51.444 --> 09:53.778
You aborted... Macklemore mother(Bleep).

09:53.863 --> 09:56.697
You *** (Bleep) look-alike Albert Nobbs.

09:57.834 --> 09:59.583
I wish I hadn't reported this.

09:59.619 --> 10:00.868
Number five.

10:00.953 --> 10:02.787
Nice razor scooter, pencil dick.

10:02.872 --> 10:03.921
You aborted Macklemore mother...

10:06.793 --> 10:08.209
Bevers, what are you even doing here?

10:08.294 --> 10:10.928
Well, that stuff you said last
night really got me thinking

10:10.963 --> 10:12.630
I can be better.

10:12.682 --> 10:14.715
I need to start by
improving my physical form.

10:14.801 --> 10:18.352
That's great, but there
are so many gyms in Astoria

10:18.438 --> 10:21.605
<i>closer to our apartment,
closer to my apartment.</i>

10:21.641 --> 10:24.308
Jesus, why'd you have to come to this one?

10:24.360 --> 10:27.645
This is the only gym
my friend Abbi works in,

10:27.697 --> 10:29.313
plus they provide free razors.

10:29.399 --> 10:30.448
You have a beard.

10:32.201 --> 10:33.567
Oh, God, ew.

10:33.653 --> 10:35.820
Abbi, angle his gluteus towards me.

10:35.905 --> 10:37.121
Yep, perfect.

10:37.156 --> 10:40.157
I'm excited to do this with you, Abbi.

10:40.243 --> 10:41.742
We can take the subway here together.

10:41.828 --> 10:43.661
I'll break for lunch whenever you do.

10:43.746 --> 10:44.745
We help each other.

10:44.831 --> 10:46.297
I don't need help, Bevers.

10:46.332 --> 10:48.132
Oh, really?

10:48.167 --> 10:51.969
'Cause I see someone is
training instead of cleaning.

10:52.004 --> 10:53.554
It's already happening, Abbi.

10:54.757 --> 10:55.840
I mean, I guess so.

10:55.925 --> 10:58.008
Oh! (Farts) I'm sorry.

10:58.094 --> 10:59.477
Okay, I think we're done.

10:59.512 --> 11:00.761
Abbi, if you farted, it's all right.

11:00.847 --> 11:02.847
Trey, I did not just fart.

11:02.899 --> 11:05.733
- I moved his gluteus sensitive...
- Yeah, that's a woman's fart.

11:07.320 --> 11:08.352
Hi, Miss Wexler?

11:08.404 --> 11:09.520
Please, call me Ilana.

11:09.572 --> 11:10.738
Actually, call me Miss Wexler.

11:10.823 --> 11:12.073
That was dope.

11:12.158 --> 11:13.741
- Okay, I was just wondering...
- Before you finish,

11:13.826 --> 11:15.025
I want you to know

11:15.078 --> 11:18.412
that you already have the answers.

11:18.498 --> 11:21.949
Unlock the solutions deep within you.

11:23.086 --> 11:24.585
(Vocalizing explosion)

11:25.705 --> 11:27.421
Now, get out of here.

11:27.507 --> 11:28.756
Oh, my God.

11:28.841 --> 11:29.840
Ilana.

11:29.876 --> 11:31.175
Please, call me Miss Wexler.

11:31.210 --> 11:33.094
Miss Wexler, I closed on that nail article.

11:33.179 --> 11:34.462
You made $400 in commission.

11:34.547 --> 11:35.880
Perfect.

11:35.932 --> 11:37.098
Now, go get another one.

11:37.183 --> 11:39.133
Holy (Bleep) moly.

11:39.218 --> 11:42.803
Baby girl, you know we
can make commission here?

11:46.526 --> 11:48.275
Love ya.

11:48.361 --> 11:50.111
My interns, gather.

11:51.397 --> 11:54.231
Okay, kids, when I started this day,

11:54.283 --> 11:55.483
I had one goal

11:55.568 --> 11:59.320
and that was to get a deal.

11:59.405 --> 12:01.205
But then I learned what commission is,

12:01.240 --> 12:05.793
and now my goal is money,
money, money, bitch.

12:05.878 --> 12:08.412
Now, I'm gonna take lunch,
but I need you guys to keep it

12:08.464 --> 12:10.965
on, on, on, on, on.

12:11.050 --> 12:13.717
Please don't leave the building
so that you work and also

12:13.753 --> 12:15.836
I won't be able to sign you
back in 'cause I won't be here.

12:15.922 --> 12:16.921
Okay.

12:16.973 --> 12:18.305
Your fly is down, yeah.

12:19.926 --> 12:20.891
(Whistling)

12:22.261 --> 12:23.177
What a cool boss.

12:27.183 --> 12:29.600
Your transformation will inspire millions.

12:29.685 --> 12:31.569
Come on, Abbi, do it with him.

12:33.606 --> 12:35.940
Abbi, motivate him, tell
him how ripped he's gonna be.

12:36.025 --> 12:37.107
So ripped.

12:37.193 --> 12:38.492
Come on, be more specific.

12:38.578 --> 12:40.995
Paint a picture of how
he's gonna look with words.

12:41.080 --> 12:44.498
Uh, muscly, like on the
top and then skinny stomach.

12:44.584 --> 12:45.616
Drop that ball.

12:45.701 --> 12:46.917
All right, buddy.

12:46.953 --> 12:48.619
Come on, yes.

12:48.671 --> 12:50.120
All right, go protein up, all right?

12:50.206 --> 12:51.455
I'll come find you, if I can see you.

12:51.541 --> 12:52.756
You're really shrinking, buddy.

12:52.792 --> 12:54.792
Bodybytrey.biz. Cut out.

12:54.877 --> 12:56.844
All right, Abbi, that was not great.

12:56.929 --> 12:59.346
Now, look, Matthew is
very special, all right?

12:59.432 --> 13:01.932
When you're home with him, I
want you to monitor his diet,

13:01.968 --> 13:03.684
his sleep, even his stool.

13:03.769 --> 13:07.521
I want you to be all over him, okay?

13:07.607 --> 13:09.890
If you can do that, there's
no telling how far we can go.

13:12.278 --> 13:13.894
Oh, and, Abbi, could you
clean up all this sweat.

13:13.980 --> 13:15.029
It's really stinky.

13:15.114 --> 13:16.647
It's actually my lunch break.

13:16.732 --> 13:17.815
Good call.

13:17.900 --> 13:19.533
It'll totally be here when you get back.

13:19.619 --> 13:21.952
But, Abbi, hashtag get clean.

13:21.988 --> 13:23.737
Your farts don't smell healthy.

13:23.823 --> 13:25.873
It's not...

- Hi.
- Hi, I'm here to meet my friend Ilana.

13:39.055 --> 13:41.005
- Oh, yes, Miss Wexler.
- Yes.

13:41.090 --> 13:42.506
Right this way, sir.

13:42.592 --> 13:43.841
I'm not a sir.

13:43.926 --> 13:46.677
I wear a ponytail out one time.

13:46.762 --> 13:47.811
Whoo-hoo!

13:47.847 --> 13:49.096
What up, queen?

13:49.181 --> 13:50.814
Check it.

13:50.850 --> 13:54.184
I got a dirty-ass Martini,
a clean white power suit,

13:54.237 --> 13:57.521
originally 119, down to 69, down to 39.

13:57.607 --> 13:58.856
Thank you.

13:58.908 --> 14:00.157
TJ Maxx.

14:00.192 --> 14:03.244
Okay, Maxinista, I think
you left the size tag on it.

14:03.329 --> 14:05.412
Whup, can't get it by ya.

14:05.498 --> 14:08.332
This, uh, Halliburton
fat-cat lunch is on me.
