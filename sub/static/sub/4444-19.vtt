00:00.454 --> 00:01.720
Previously on The Fosters...

00:01.725 --> 00:03.808
<i>[Jude] You kissed me,
remember, in the tent?</i>

00:03.824 --> 00:05.724
<i>Then at the movie
theater you held my hand.</i>

00:05.759 --> 00:08.676
<i>I just, I don't get
this, I don't get you.</i>

00:08.729 --> 00:11.596
Do you think we made a
mistake, firing Timothy?

00:11.648 --> 00:13.765
I was five months pregnant
and I lost the baby.

00:13.767 --> 00:15.900
And now out twins' birth mom is pregnant

00:15.936 --> 00:19.020
and she's asked Stef
and me to adopt the baby.

00:19.072 --> 00:22.574
- Are you guys gonna take Ana's baby?
- I don't think so.

00:22.609 --> 00:24.909
I think I'm gonna ask her if I can.

00:24.945 --> 00:26.778
<i>You bribed them?</i>

00:26.830 --> 00:29.047
<i>[Brandon] I just wanted to make
sure Dad didn't go to prison.</i>

00:29.082 --> 00:30.559
Daphne, where are you?

00:30.587 --> 00:32.654
Look, I just wanted you to know
that I told the police about Tasha.

00:32.749 --> 00:37.352
That I took her, it's over, so you
could stay with Jude at the Fosters.

00:37.404 --> 00:39.388
- What's going on, Callie?
- I did something wrong and I couldn't tell you.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.490
Is this why you're going
to live with Robert?

00:41.525 --> 00:44.359
I just thought that if I left on
my own it wouldn't hurt as much

00:44.411 --> 00:46.411
as if you told me to go but it does.

00:46.446 --> 00:48.613
- OK, listen...
- It hurts so much.

00:48.665 --> 00:52.334
Look at me. Nothing you can do
is gonna make us not want you.

00:52.369 --> 00:54.619
You're wasting your time,
Stef. You're too late.

00:54.671 --> 00:56.538
Well, I'm not going down without a fight.

00:57.708 --> 00:59.741
All we're asking is to go back

00:59.776 --> 01:02.511
to the 180 day waiting
period, or what's left of it.

01:02.546 --> 01:04.262
And when the judge asks why?

01:04.298 --> 01:06.381
We say Callie needs more
time. To get to know Robert.

01:06.383 --> 01:08.283
And this just suddenly occurred to her?

01:08.318 --> 01:11.386
[Stef] Yes. While she was packing to
leave a home she feels safe and secure in

01:11.438 --> 01:13.522
to go live with a man she hardly knows.

01:13.557 --> 01:15.724
Paperwork's done. The wheels are in motion.

01:15.759 --> 01:18.393
- So, stop them, Marie.
- No, it's my fault.

01:18.395 --> 01:20.395
It's not your fault, it's Robert's fault.

01:20.430 --> 01:22.096
He knew that you were lying to the judge

01:22.097 --> 01:23.397
when you asked to go and live with him.

01:24.484 --> 01:28.570
OK, what if Robert asked the
judge to give Callie more time?

01:28.622 --> 01:30.372
That's interesting.

01:30.407 --> 01:33.575
Why would he do that when he's
so close to getting what he wants.

01:33.627 --> 01:36.661
If Callie asked him, in front of the judge,

01:36.713 --> 01:39.748
I mean, he wants to be
seen like a loving father.

01:39.783 --> 01:42.417
So, we put him on the spot?

01:42.469 --> 01:44.586
Would you be comfortable doing that?

01:44.638 --> 01:47.422
I guess. But, even if we get more time...

01:47.424 --> 01:50.458
All right, first things first.

01:50.494 --> 01:53.511
I just don't feel like you should be
spending any more money on lawyers,

01:53.564 --> 01:56.481
no offense, if the judge is just
gonna make me go live with him anyway.

01:56.516 --> 01:59.434
Let us worry about the money, love.

01:59.486 --> 02:02.320
The immediate goal right now
is to keep you in this house,

02:02.356 --> 02:04.656
with us, for as long as possible.

02:12.449 --> 02:14.583
[sighs] Thanks, Maria.

02:14.618 --> 02:16.668
- I'll call the judge in the morning.
- OK.

02:16.703 --> 02:19.337
But look, Callie's got a point.

02:19.373 --> 02:21.673
This judge is clearly biased
toward the birth father.

02:21.708 --> 02:23.758
I hate to see you to spend
more money jumping through hoops

02:23.794 --> 02:26.461
just to delay what's inevitable.

02:26.513 --> 02:28.763
I have no intention of
waiting for the inevitable.

02:28.799 --> 02:30.632
You got something up your sleeve?

02:38.692 --> 02:41.776
<i>♪ It's not where you come from ♪</i>

02:41.812 --> 02:45.447
<i>♪ It's where you belong ♪</i>

02:45.482 --> 02:51.453
<i>♪ Nothing I would trade I
wouldn't have it any other way ♪</i>

02:51.488 --> 02:56.625
<i>♪ You're surrounded by
love and you're wanted ♪</i>

02:56.660 --> 03:00.378
<i>♪ So never feel alone ♪</i>

03:00.414 --> 03:05.300

[pop music plays quietly]

03:16.513 --> 03:19.397
- Oh. Sorry.
- It's OK. I'm just brushing my teeth.

03:24.354 --> 03:26.321
So, did they talk to
you about the tour yet?

03:26.356 --> 03:29.491
Uh, no, not yet, but, I'm like
110 percent sure I'm not going.

03:29.526 --> 03:30.659
I'm so sorry.

03:30.694 --> 03:32.577
Stop. It's not the end of the world.

03:32.612 --> 03:35.613
- Have you told the band?
- Not yet.

03:35.666 --> 03:38.366
I'm gonna do it tonight,
I figure, all together.

03:38.488 --> 03:39.771
You're not gonna give Lou a heads up?

03:39.823 --> 03:41.689
Uh, I figure safety in numbers.

03:45.412 --> 03:47.695
- [groans] I have to brush my teeth!
- Get in line.

03:47.748 --> 03:49.781
[groans]

03:49.783 --> 03:52.367
I'm so sick of sharing a bathroom!

03:52.419 --> 03:56.454
- Seriously?
- What? I gotta brush, too.

03:56.456 --> 03:59.791
No! Out! We're at capacity!

03:59.843 --> 04:01.626
What're you so spun out about?

04:01.678 --> 04:04.429
Oh, nothing, just that Callie's moving out,

04:04.464 --> 04:06.564
um, I can't find anyone
to dance on my dance team,

04:06.600 --> 04:09.467
Jesus is going to boarding school,
but other than that, I'm awesome.

04:09.469 --> 04:10.769
[both] You're going to boarding school?

04:10.804 --> 04:15.573
No... maybe... probably not.

04:15.609 --> 04:17.642
[Mariana] They offered him a scholarship.

04:17.644 --> 04:18.810
[both] Academic?

04:18.812 --> 04:22.781
No. Wrestling. And the
school's in Colorado.

04:22.816 --> 04:24.649
I thought you said I could go.

04:24.701 --> 04:27.368
I never said I'd be happy about it.

04:27.404 --> 04:29.587
And you're probably gonna
have to move in with Jude.

04:29.623 --> 04:31.706
- Jude? Why?
- To make room for the baby.

04:31.741 --> 04:33.591
[both] What baby?

04:35.662 --> 04:37.378
[sighs] It's not for sure.

04:37.414 --> 04:40.582
They're gonna do it. Moms wanted
a baby and Ana's having a girl

04:40.634 --> 04:42.667
and she's our sister, and it's perfect.

04:42.669 --> 04:44.552
How could they not? It's like fate.

04:44.588 --> 04:46.471
[groans] We're gonna be late.

04:48.592 --> 04:49.591
It's not gonna happen.

04:49.643 --> 04:51.476
How do you know?

04:51.511 --> 04:52.610
I talked to Moms.

04:52.646 --> 04:56.347
Good, it means I don't
have to move in with Jude.

04:56.399 --> 04:59.567
I mean, I guess that's too bad about Ana.

04:59.603 --> 05:03.388
And Mariana. She's gonna be really
upset. Why haven't they told her?

05:03.423 --> 05:05.557
I don't know if they told Ana.

05:05.592 --> 05:07.525
[groans] Forgot mascara!

05:13.366 --> 05:16.534
You know what? You should ask
Emma to be on the dance team.

05:16.536 --> 05:18.419
- Yeah, right.
- I'm serious.

05:18.455 --> 05:21.539
She used to be a
cheerleader, in junior high.

05:21.541 --> 05:22.707
Emma?

05:22.742 --> 05:25.710
- Did you get the email from Marie?
- No.

05:25.712 --> 05:28.546
How many times have we told
them not to leave the milk out?

05:28.548 --> 05:30.715
- What'd it say?
- Uh...

05:30.767 --> 05:34.385
The judge can see us at today
at 12:30. Does that work for you?

05:34.437 --> 05:36.721
I guess it has to.

05:36.773 --> 05:39.807
I really don't like Callie
having to put on a show.

05:39.860 --> 05:42.660
It's not a show, love.
This is what she wants.

05:42.696 --> 05:44.612
It sure as hell's not what Robert wants.

05:44.708 --> 05:48.626
I don't see any world in which he's going to
ask the judge to delay his getting custody.

05:48.628 --> 05:50.511
You never know.

05:50.547 --> 05:53.765
By the way, Jesus wants us to reschedule
the meeting with the Flintwood scout.

05:53.800 --> 05:55.767
I thought he wasn't ready to leave home?

05:55.802 --> 05:57.889
Apparently, Mariana thinks
it would be good a good idea.

05:57.890 --> 05:58.890
[chuckles]

05:59.522 --> 06:01.472
You know, Monte went to boarding school.

06:01.474 --> 06:03.775
Oh, did she? Didn't know that.

06:03.810 --> 06:05.643
She said it saved her life.

06:05.695 --> 06:09.447
Hmm. Had a troubled youth, did she?

06:09.482 --> 06:11.566
She said it was the only reason
she got into a good college.

06:11.618 --> 06:13.851
- [in snooty accent] She probably went to Harvard.
- Princeton, actually.

06:13.887 --> 06:17.822
Well, la-de-da. Since we're
running all our big family decisions

06:17.824 --> 06:20.375
past your new boss, maybe
I should probably meet her.

06:20.410 --> 06:22.377
Don't you wanna run it by Mike?

06:22.412 --> 06:24.545
[chuckles] That's funny.

06:24.581 --> 06:26.664
Seriously, you should invite her to dinner.

06:26.666 --> 06:30.551
[sighs] Like we have time
to entertain. I gotta go.

06:30.587 --> 06:33.504
- I love you. All right.
- I love you. I'll see you later.

_

07:01.731 --> 07:04.814
_

07:17.606 --> 07:19.739
You were a cheerleader?!

07:20.826 --> 07:22.525
That was a long time ago.

07:23.695 --> 07:25.912
Two years is not a long time.

07:25.948 --> 07:29.699
Look, please try out for my dance team.

07:29.751 --> 07:31.868
Look, I quit cheerleading
and I started wrestling

07:31.920 --> 07:35.622
because I didn't want to be
the silly girl on the sidelines.

07:35.674 --> 07:36.873
I wanted to be in the game.

07:36.875 --> 07:39.843
We are the game. We're not
cheering anybody else on.

07:39.878 --> 07:42.846
We're a competitive dance team.
And you're very competitive.

07:42.881 --> 07:45.765
I'm just don't feel comfortable
exploiting my sexuality.

07:45.801 --> 07:47.767
I'm asking you to dance, not to strip.

07:47.803 --> 07:50.020
Look, if you're not gonna do it for me,

07:50.055 --> 07:53.556
do it to avenge all the victims
of mean girls everywhere.

07:53.608 --> 07:55.942
And I know you're one of them.

07:58.864 --> 08:00.814
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:00.866 --> 08:05.702
Um, do you have any gum? I didn't
brush my teeth this morning.

08:05.737 --> 08:07.737
- Exhale.
- No.

08:07.739 --> 08:08.738
[Connor] Come on.

08:09.908 --> 08:11.875
[exhales]

08:11.910 --> 08:14.577
- Oh, my God, that's disgusting.
- I told you!

08:14.613 --> 08:17.497
I'm just kidding. But
seriously, you need some gum.

08:17.549 --> 08:18.665
[chuckles]

08:20.585 --> 08:23.753
Hey, so, you want to hang out after
school? We could do our homework?

08:23.755 --> 08:25.839
Sure. You want to come over.

08:25.891 --> 08:27.841
Yeah, I'll meet you at the bench.

08:35.017 --> 08:36.982
Hey, Brandon.

08:37.019 --> 08:40.937
I got your email and I talked
to our friends over at Idyllwild.

08:40.989 --> 08:44.541
Unfortunately, it's too
late, they gave up your spot.

08:44.576 --> 08:46.609
Yeah, I figured.

08:46.611 --> 08:49.996
However, when I explained to them why
you didn't jump at the scholarship...

08:50.032 --> 08:54.784
Wait, you told them? Now
they'll never consider me.

08:54.836 --> 08:59.706
That's not true. They said they'd make
another spot for you. If you audition.

08:59.758 --> 09:02.625
You said you played the
Bach prelude perfectly.

09:02.627 --> 09:04.594
No, it wasn't perfect.

09:04.629 --> 09:07.931
It just wasn't a disaster.
My extension's not the same.

09:07.966 --> 09:10.934
So, practice. It's not like
you've got anything to lose.

09:15.974 --> 09:20.610
[woman] ... but there's many
motifs within <i> Silas Marner.</i>

09:20.645 --> 09:24.647
It's a book that explores a
plethora of themes, including

09:24.649 --> 09:27.784
religion, community,

09:27.819 --> 09:32.722
love, deception, status, and redemption.

09:32.758 --> 09:36.826
So, to answer your original question,

09:36.862 --> 09:40.797
we will be critically
examining each of these themes

09:40.832 --> 09:44.834
page by page, and chapter by chapter.

09:44.836 --> 09:47.720
I've just got a few
minutes. What's going on?

09:47.756 --> 09:51.975
Your Honor, I understand that
Callie is feeling confused

09:52.010 --> 09:54.844
about her decision to come
live with me and my family.

09:54.896 --> 09:57.597
And because I want her
to feel absolutely certain

09:57.649 --> 10:00.984
and secure in our home, I
think she needs more time.

10:01.019 --> 10:03.953
So, you're asking to go
back to the waiting period?

10:03.989 --> 10:07.907
Yes, Your Honor. I still strongly
believe that my daughter belongs with me,

10:07.993 --> 10:11.928
but I'm willing to wait until we've had
a chance to get to know each other better.

10:11.963 --> 10:13.863
Callie, this is what you want?

10:13.899 --> 10:15.832
Yes, sir.

10:15.867 --> 10:17.801
And ladies, I'm assuming
this is OK with you?

10:17.836 --> 10:19.786
Yes, Your Honor.

10:19.838 --> 10:22.872
We... we just want Callie to feel safe.

10:22.874 --> 10:25.875
OK. We'll go back to the original plan.

10:25.927 --> 10:28.678
With one amendment.

10:28.713 --> 10:31.047
I think once a week visitation
is probably not enough time

10:31.082 --> 10:33.766
for Callie to get to know
her father, so in addition,

10:33.802 --> 10:37.720
I'm going to give Mr. Quinn
every other weekend as well.

10:59.961 --> 11:01.945
- You OK, Cal?
- Yeah.

11:01.980 --> 11:04.647
You should get to class.

11:04.683 --> 11:07.617
We'll talk more tonight, OK?

11:07.652 --> 11:08.668
- Love you.
- Love you.

11:08.720 --> 11:09.802
Love you.

11:16.728 --> 11:18.845
What the hell was that?

11:18.897 --> 11:21.931
Why would Robert ask the judge to give
Callie more time before Callie even asked him?

11:21.933 --> 11:23.518
He knew why we were there.

11:23.519 --> 11:26.181
My bet is he wanted to play
the hero, for Callie's benefit.

11:26.237 --> 11:29.856
Well, now she's going to spend
every other weekend with him.

11:29.908 --> 11:31.641
Do you think it was really worth it?

11:31.676 --> 11:34.661
Yes, because it bought us time.

11:34.696 --> 11:35.862
For what?

11:37.916 --> 11:39.849
To get Callie emancipated.

11:44.389 --> 11:47.455
If we can get Callie emancipated
before the waiting period is up,

11:47.486 --> 11:49.786
then she's no longer a ward of the state.

11:49.821 --> 11:54.824
She's considered an adult and wouldn't
need anyone's consent to be adopted by us.

11:54.826 --> 11:57.577
And what if Robert finds out? Or the judge?

11:57.629 --> 12:00.463
No, emancipation petitions
aren't heard in family court.

12:00.499 --> 12:02.715
And Robert wouldn't find out.

12:02.751 --> 12:04.501
If Callie doesn't tell him,

12:04.553 --> 12:06.503
which is asking her to do
exactly what we accused Robert of.

12:06.555 --> 12:10.507
To give her a choice, not take it away.
Which is what Robert is trying to do.

12:10.509 --> 12:12.675
This is a... this is a very gray area.

12:12.677 --> 12:15.678
And so was not reporting Callie and
Brandon as accessories to a kidnapping.

12:15.680 --> 12:18.815
- They were just trying to do the right thing.
- So are we.

12:20.602 --> 12:23.520
How long does it take to get emancipated?

12:23.572 --> 12:24.854
It's... it's gonna be tight.

12:24.906 --> 12:27.407
It's gonna be tight.

12:27.442 --> 12:31.528
So this is what you meant
by first things first.

12:31.530 --> 12:34.447
And you just decided that this was the
plan, without discussing it with me?

12:34.499 --> 12:39.786
I didn't want to get anyone's hopes
up, in case we didn't get the time.

12:39.838 --> 12:42.839
Callie's gonna have to want to do
this. We can't pressure her into it.

12:42.874 --> 12:44.624
We won't.

12:44.676 --> 12:46.793
- It's ultimately up to her.
- Let's talk to her tonight.

12:46.845 --> 12:49.762
Oh. Hey. I was looking for you.

12:49.798 --> 12:51.681
Uh, Monte, this is my wife, Stef.

12:51.716 --> 12:55.552
It's so nice to meet you. I've
heard so many great things.

12:55.554 --> 12:59.439
Likewise. In fact, I was just saying that
we should have you over for dinner some time.

12:59.474 --> 13:01.608
- I'd love that.
- How about tonight?

13:01.643 --> 13:03.726
- [Monte] Tonight?
- I'm sure she has plans.

13:03.728 --> 13:06.529
Actually, I don't. But, are you sure?

13:06.565 --> 13:09.449
- Yes.
- Yes, we'd love to have you.

13:13.545 --> 13:16.829
So, if we don't find four girls
today, we'll just have to...

13:16.865 --> 13:18.498
Concede defeat.

13:18.500 --> 13:19.882
It's not defeat to drop out.

13:19.918 --> 13:22.802
Of course it is. Quitting
is way worse than losing.

13:22.837 --> 13:26.556
Yeah, well, I think we're in trouble.

13:26.591 --> 13:28.841
Keep an open mind. You never know.

13:36.985 --> 13:38.685
OK, I'll do it.

13:38.737 --> 13:40.570
- [chuckles]
- No way.

13:40.605 --> 13:43.823
Um, hey, isn't that your foster sister?

13:49.748 --> 13:52.865
Hey. Everything OK?

13:52.917 --> 13:53.916
Yeah. Why?

13:53.952 --> 13:56.536
What are you doing here?

13:56.588 --> 13:58.538
Aren't these open auditions?

13:58.540 --> 14:02.458
Are you... ? Oh my God!

14:02.510 --> 14:05.545
[giggles]

14:05.597 --> 14:09.465
[plays scales]

14:16.608 --> 14:18.958
[groans]

14:28.870 --> 14:29.902
[door opens]

14:37.579 --> 14:39.846
[Ana sighs]

14:43.802 --> 14:45.752
- Oh, God!
- Sorry.

14:45.804 --> 14:47.670
- I didn't mean to scare you.
- Oh.

14:47.722 --> 14:49.542
My dad... said I could practice here.

14:49.543 --> 14:52.238
The piano. He said you wouldn't be home.

14:54.863 --> 14:55.812
Is everything OK?

14:55.847 --> 14:58.564
Uh, yeah. I...

14:58.600 --> 15:01.601
... just got this letter,
returned to me, it's silly.

15:01.636 --> 15:03.486
Well, maybe the person moved?

15:03.521 --> 15:06.939
No. It's not the first
one they've sent back.

15:09.644 --> 15:10.877
Listen, um...

15:12.747 --> 15:16.699
I'm really sorry I took that money
from you. I shouldn't have done that.

15:16.751 --> 15:19.619
No, I... I shouldn't have...

15:19.621 --> 15:23.790
No, you were just trying to
help your dad. He's a good man.

15:23.792 --> 15:26.709
He didn't do anything wrong.

15:29.664 --> 15:33.566
I was lying. I don't even remember why now.

15:34.969 --> 15:36.636
I'll try to pay you back.

15:36.638 --> 15:40.690
No, it's really OK. [Chuckles]

15:40.725 --> 15:42.775
My dad gave me money, so...

15:42.811 --> 15:45.978
Then, I'll add it to all I owe him already.

15:45.980 --> 15:50.983
Well, I should get out
of here, let you practice.

15:50.985 --> 15:53.953
It's OK, really.

15:53.988 --> 15:57.874
No, I'm supposed to be apartment hunting.

15:57.909 --> 16:00.626
Your dad'll be really happy
you're playing piano again.

16:05.884 --> 16:09.802
[door opens, closes]

16:20.932 --> 16:23.816
[Mariana] Five, six, seven, eight.

16:23.852 --> 16:26.519
- OK, everybody got it?
- Yeah.

16:26.571 --> 16:28.688
Got it.

16:28.740 --> 16:33.826
OK, well, just have fun and bring it.

16:35.747 --> 16:38.748
[dance music plays]

17:20.742 --> 17:23.459
That was fantastic!

17:23.494 --> 17:26.746
Thank you! Give us just a moment.

17:30.635 --> 17:34.921
So, what'd Mariana promise you to
audition? I'm getting her first born.

17:34.923 --> 17:38.841
Oh, I'm just being supportive,
even if it was slightly humiliating.

17:38.893 --> 17:40.560
So Emma's awesome.

17:40.595 --> 17:41.761
She rocked it.

17:41.813 --> 17:43.679
And Grace was better than I thought.

17:43.731 --> 17:45.681
For sure and Ivy?

17:45.733 --> 17:47.850
[Tia] Moves really well.

17:47.902 --> 17:49.602
They'd never make Kaitlyn's team.

17:49.654 --> 17:50.937
But we're not Kaitlyn's team.

17:50.989 --> 17:54.690
Exactly. We're every woman.

17:54.742 --> 17:57.827
[chuckles] Um, but the two on the right... ?

17:57.862 --> 17:59.495
Mm, <i> no bueno.</i>

17:59.531 --> 18:00.913
And. Um, Callie?

18:03.785 --> 18:04.834
Was awesome.

18:09.791 --> 18:13.509
OK, so, my two ladies on the right,

18:13.545 --> 18:17.763
I'm sorry, but thank you for auditioning.

18:17.799 --> 18:21.684
Everyone else... you're in!

18:22.854 --> 18:25.771
- Wait, me?
- Yes, you!

18:30.728 --> 18:31.944
I'm so excited!

18:32.070 --> 18:34.787
[screams happily] We're a team!

18:57.979 --> 18:59.011
Hey, you ready?

19:14.130 --> 19:16.363
So, what's the deal with Daria?

19:17.065 --> 19:18.188
What'd you mean?

19:18.194 --> 19:22.863
Are you guys gonna
like... keep hanging out?

19:22.898 --> 19:25.950
Well, I think it's... it's good

19:26.002 --> 19:28.869
'cause... my dad's cool with us.

19:29.972 --> 19:31.171
'Cause you have a girlfriend?

19:33.876 --> 19:36.877
Well, we all have fun together don't we?

19:38.097 --> 19:39.880
I guess.

19:41.934 --> 19:45.886
So, Daria and Taylor are
sneaking out tomorrow night.

19:45.938 --> 19:49.940
They're gonna go TP some girl's
house and they want us to come.

19:51.944 --> 19:55.896
- Get out. I have to study.
- That's what we're doing.

19:55.931 --> 19:58.065
- I can't concentrate with you two in here.
- We'll be quiet.

19:58.067 --> 20:01.035
I can hear you breathing.
Go use the dining room.

20:01.070 --> 20:03.287
[approaching footsteps]

20:03.322 --> 20:06.040
Oh, sorry, you guys, I
need to set the table.

20:06.075 --> 20:07.992
We're eating in here?

20:08.044 --> 20:09.076
Monte's coming for dinner.

20:09.145 --> 20:10.961
The principal's coming here?

20:10.997 --> 20:12.179
Yeah, you wanna stay, Connor?

20:12.214 --> 20:13.297
No, thanks.

20:13.332 --> 20:17.251
OK, well, you guys can
study out back, please.

20:17.286 --> 20:20.254
I put the water on, but I don't know
why we don't just order in, love.

20:20.256 --> 20:23.007
Because it's expensive and I don't
want the principal of the school

20:23.059 --> 20:25.926
to think we feed the
kids take-out every night.

20:25.978 --> 20:28.262
And frankly, I wish you hadn't invited her.

20:28.264 --> 20:32.266
We have so much going on,
and we need to talk to Callie.

20:32.268 --> 20:34.852
Talk to me about what?

20:40.159 --> 20:43.911
OK, maybe we can try the living room.

20:50.119 --> 20:53.003
Uh, hey, guys, we're having a
little bit of a private conversation.

20:53.039 --> 20:54.254
Uh, OK, sorry.

20:55.925 --> 20:59.093
OK, yeah, I should
probably get home anyway.

20:59.128 --> 21:01.261
See you later, Connor.

21:09.305 --> 21:12.139
There's nowhere to be alone in this house.

21:12.191 --> 21:14.975
Hey, if we sneak out,
tomorrow night after TP'ing,

21:15.027 --> 21:18.862
we could hangout, you know, by ourselves.

21:22.201 --> 21:24.284
So what would I have to do?

21:24.320 --> 21:27.020
First we get you off probation,
your hearing is next week

21:27.056 --> 21:29.907
and your P.O. sees no
reason that it won't go well.

21:29.959 --> 21:33.243
Then, you have to prove that you can pay
for an apartment and support yourself.

21:33.295 --> 21:35.963
I can't live with you?

21:35.998 --> 21:39.216
You can. The court needs to see that
you can afford to live on your own.

21:39.251 --> 21:43.137
In case we were to ever asked you
to leave, which we would never do.

21:43.172 --> 21:45.005
An apartment costs a lot of money.

21:45.057 --> 21:47.975
Yeah. You'd have to get a
full time job and go to school.

21:48.010 --> 21:50.144
But remember, this is just temporary.

21:50.179 --> 21:53.097
Yeah, as soon as you're emancipated,
we can adopt you right away.

21:53.149 --> 21:55.916
And you wouldn't have
to maintain any of that.

21:55.951 --> 22:00.320
And you do need to keep this from
Robert, which we don't feel good about.

22:00.356 --> 22:04.191
But sometimes, Callie,
the end justify the means.

22:06.112 --> 22:10.864
This is the only way we know, to
give you the choice that you deserve.

22:12.101 --> 22:15.235
[jazz music plays]

22:15.271 --> 22:19.089
So Brandon, your mom...

22:19.125 --> 22:20.841
Are you both "Mom?"

22:20.876 --> 22:22.910
I'm "Mom", she's "Mama."

22:22.945 --> 22:26.213
Your Mama tells me that you might be
going on tour this summer, with your band?

22:26.248 --> 22:30.100
Uh, yeah, I don't think
that's happening anymore.

22:30.136 --> 22:33.220
- Oh, why do you think that?
- Well, it isn't, right?

22:33.255 --> 22:34.341
Well, we have some things to discuss,

22:34.342 --> 22:36.226
but as far as we're
concerned, you're good to go.

22:39.945 --> 22:43.113
So, Monte, um, I understand
that you went to boarding school.

22:43.149 --> 22:46.116
Mm, yeah, for my last
two years of high school.

22:46.152 --> 22:47.951
Is boarding school as
wild as they say it is?

22:47.987 --> 22:52.005
Ah, well, not the one that
I went to, unfortunately.

22:52.041 --> 22:55.008
I'm sorry Jesus couldn't join us.
I'd love to hear more about Flintwood.

22:55.044 --> 22:56.994
You really see Jesus
going to military school?

22:57.046 --> 22:59.913
- Nothing's been decided.
- Where'd you go to college?

22:59.982 --> 23:03.217
Well, I studied pre-law at
Princeton and then I decided

23:03.252 --> 23:06.186
I did not want to be a lawyer so I
got my graduate degree in business.

23:06.222 --> 23:09.056
- Oh, from where?
- From Yale.

23:09.091 --> 23:10.958
[Mariana] Wow. Princeton and Yale.

23:12.091 --> 23:13.791
That's impressive.

23:13.826 --> 23:16.193
What you do is impressive,
as far as I'm concerned.

23:16.228 --> 23:20.197
You certainly don't need a degree
from Yale to give out speeding tickets.

23:20.249 --> 23:22.749
I'm sure you do far more than that.

23:22.785 --> 23:25.119
I want to go to an Ivy league
school. Not that we could afford it.

23:25.171 --> 23:27.754
Yeah, maybe you can get like
a dance scholarship, you know.

23:27.790 --> 23:28.872
Ha ha.

23:28.874 --> 23:30.207
When are we having this dance-off?

23:30.259 --> 23:34.044
Next week. And guess who
joined the team today?

23:34.046 --> 23:35.963
- Don't.
- Callie!

23:36.015 --> 23:37.848
[Stef] Really?

23:37.883 --> 23:40.217
Wow, dance team just got
a lot more interesting.

23:40.269 --> 23:42.136
Can I please come to your rehearsals?

23:42.188 --> 23:45.022
[laughter]

23:45.057 --> 23:46.940
Can we talk about Timothy?

23:46.976 --> 23:50.027
Oh, sweetheart, why don't we just
wait for the school assembly for that.

23:50.062 --> 23:51.962
I don't mind.

23:51.997 --> 23:55.065
I don't know if he got fired because he made
us read that article on education reform,

23:55.100 --> 23:57.901
but I found it very informative.

23:57.903 --> 24:01.071
It laid out both sides of the debate
and if the point of Common Core

24:01.073 --> 24:05.075
is to make us deeper thinkers, then
Timothy should be like... on their poster.

24:05.127 --> 24:06.977
It's true. He's the best
teacher I've ever had.

24:07.012 --> 24:09.796
Me, too. Except for music.

24:09.832 --> 24:13.083
He challenges us to consider all
points of view and to think about,

24:13.135 --> 24:18.822
like, not just what we think about
something, but why we think it.

24:18.858 --> 24:22.759
I really look forward
to his class. We all do.

24:22.811 --> 24:25.062
No other teacher has made me
want to learn as much as he does.

24:34.990 --> 24:36.823
Sorry I'm late.

24:36.859 --> 24:40.110
Mercury's in retrograde, man.

24:40.162 --> 24:44.915
OK, we're all here. So, what's up?

24:44.950 --> 24:47.034
I just wanted to tell you

24:47.086 --> 24:51.171
that I don't think... I can't go on tour.

24:58.964 --> 25:00.931
Five, six, seven, eight,

25:00.966 --> 25:04.017
step, flick, pop, pop, drop, jump,

25:04.053 --> 25:07.020
hands, hair, hips, OK?

25:07.056 --> 25:10.857
Again. Five, six, seven, eight,

25:10.893 --> 25:14.144
step, flick, pop, pop, drop, jump.

25:14.146 --> 25:17.064
OK... Wait, wider legs, a little bit.

25:17.116 --> 25:18.899
Like this.

25:18.951 --> 25:22.736
Drop, jump, hands, hair, hip hip.

25:26.041 --> 25:29.209
Drop, jump, hands, hips.

25:29.245 --> 25:33.130
OK, but slow it down. It's
supposed to look sexy, like this.

25:35.801 --> 25:38.835
- Hip hip.
- I can't do that.

25:38.887 --> 25:43.140
Well, sure you can, you just
flip your hair and smile like:

25:43.175 --> 25:45.759
Ooh, I know you want me.

25:45.811 --> 25:48.812
- Yeah, no, I...
- Try it.

25:48.847 --> 25:49.846
OK.

25:54.270 --> 25:58.238
See, that was almost
it but actually say it.

26:00.109 --> 26:03.910
Ooh, I know you want me. I'm sex-y.

26:03.946 --> 26:04.995
I'm not saying that.

26:05.030 --> 26:06.997
OK, well, loosen up a little bit.

26:07.032 --> 26:09.032
- You're so tense here.
- Mariana, stop.

26:09.084 --> 26:11.785
Sorry.

26:11.837 --> 26:15.088
Um, I have like a lot of homework I think.

26:15.124 --> 26:19.092
Yeah, sure. We'll pick this
up in rehearsal tomorrow.

26:19.128 --> 26:21.795
- Great.
- Awesome.

26:26.218 --> 26:28.935
- [Monte] Thank you.
- [Stef] You're welcome.

26:28.971 --> 26:31.054
- [Monte] Oh, that's good, thanks.
- [Stef chuckles]

26:31.056 --> 26:33.190
You have a gorgeous home

26:33.225 --> 26:36.860
and your kids are amazing,
what a lovely family.

26:36.895 --> 26:39.946
Oh, thank you. Remember that next time
one of them decides to stage a walk-out.

26:39.982 --> 26:41.114
[chuckles]

26:41.150 --> 26:42.899
Mariana's very impressive.

26:42.901 --> 26:46.153
I was really moved by the
way she talked about Timothy.

26:46.205 --> 26:48.872
She's very special.

26:48.907 --> 26:54.077
Can I ask? Did the kids
know he was your donor?

26:58.117 --> 27:02.753
They did. They did. It was
supposed to be anonymous.

27:02.805 --> 27:05.138
(chuckles) Since we're sharing,
it was really funny though

27:05.174 --> 27:08.141
because Jesus came home, unexpectedly,

27:08.177 --> 27:12.896
and found Timothy's
deposit in our bathroom.

27:12.931 --> 27:15.766
- It was just...
- Oh, my.

27:15.818 --> 27:17.851
- That must have been...
- Yeah.

27:17.903 --> 27:19.903
Yeah, extremely... extremely awkward.

27:19.938 --> 27:22.189
But, as you can see,
they have a lot of respect

27:22.241 --> 27:24.991
for Timothy and were very supportive.

27:25.027 --> 27:26.977
I'm very sorry for your loss.

27:27.012 --> 27:29.813
You know, now, seeing
how special Mariana is,

27:29.848 --> 27:32.115
I can understand why you're so torn.

27:33.836 --> 27:36.086
Torn about what?

27:36.121 --> 27:39.056
About adopting Ana's baby.

27:41.794 --> 27:44.094
Oh, we are? We're torn?

27:52.765 --> 27:56.767
Hey, did you have anything to do
with moms letting me go on tour?

27:56.819 --> 27:58.986
I might have put in a good word.

27:59.021 --> 28:01.738
I wish you hadn't done that.

28:01.774 --> 28:03.740
I thought you wanted to go.

28:03.776 --> 28:08.862
I did, but that was like
before when I couldn't...

28:08.914 --> 28:12.616
I got an audition to Idyllwild.
They're gonna give me another shot.

28:12.668 --> 28:14.584
- That's great.
- Well, no,

28:14.620 --> 28:17.671
because I can't do both. And I
really want to go to Idyllwild.

28:17.706 --> 28:19.923
So, tell the band. I'm
sure they'll understand.

28:19.959 --> 28:22.743
I'm not sure Lou will understand.

28:22.778 --> 28:27.631
Which is why I lied and told them that my
moms changed their minds about letting me go.

28:28.968 --> 28:32.052
I... I think... Do you
want to know what I think?

28:32.087 --> 28:34.655
Mm, not really.

28:34.690 --> 28:36.139
[both chuckle]

28:36.191 --> 28:38.892
What I do want to know is what the hell
are you doing on Mariana's dance team.

28:38.894 --> 28:42.863
[groans] I felt bad for her and so
I was just trying to be supportive.

28:42.898 --> 28:45.782
I never thought I'd make
it. I'm not a good dancer.

28:45.818 --> 28:47.968
- Just tell her then.
- I'm pretty sure she knows.

28:48.037 --> 28:49.069
That you don't want to be on the team.

28:49.071 --> 28:51.655
I can't. She needs six dancers. I'm stuck.

28:51.707 --> 28:52.990
Well, I think you should
just be honest with her.

28:53.042 --> 28:55.659
Did I ask what you think?

28:55.711 --> 28:59.746
Tell you what, if you will, I will.

29:06.672 --> 29:09.589
All I did was tell her that I
was struggling with this decision.

29:09.591 --> 29:13.844
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Why didn't you tell me about your secret emancipation plan?

29:13.896 --> 29:15.979
[groans] Is this what we're
going to do? Tit for tat? OK.

29:16.015 --> 29:18.732
I'm not going to feel bad about
sharing something with a friend.

29:18.767 --> 29:21.635
Oh, so now she's a
friend? That's interesting.

29:21.670 --> 29:23.020
I don't have that many people to talk to.

29:23.072 --> 29:25.605
So talk to me.

29:25.657 --> 29:27.824
Honey, listen, I thought you
were very clear about the fact

29:27.860 --> 29:29.826
that you didn't want to adopt Ana's baby.

29:29.862 --> 29:32.079
Well, I'm not.

29:32.114 --> 29:36.083
I'm worried that Mariana will feel like
we don't love her as much as we say we do.

29:36.118 --> 29:38.085
That's ridiculous.

29:38.120 --> 29:41.788
OK. Good talk. Thanks.

29:41.790 --> 29:44.624
Hey, I didn't mean that you're ridiculous.

29:44.626 --> 29:47.761
Mariana knows how much
we love her, come on.

29:47.796 --> 29:50.964
She was already worried that
I'd love Frankie more than her.

29:51.016 --> 29:54.684
And if I wanted a baby that was a part of me,
why wouldn't I want one that's part of her?

29:54.720 --> 29:57.687
Why wouldn't we want a baby
as beautiful as our Mariana?

29:57.723 --> 29:59.890
- It's not that simple.
- Isn't it?

29:59.942 --> 30:02.008
No, it's not.

30:02.044 --> 30:04.644
[soft folk rock music plays]

30:04.646 --> 30:07.914
We can't adopt Ana's baby
because we feel guilty.

30:10.035 --> 30:13.070
I don't mind talking about this
some more with you, I don't.

30:13.122 --> 30:15.856
But what I do mind

30:15.891 --> 30:17.874
is not knowing what
you're thinking or feeling

30:17.910 --> 30:21.828
and hearing about it from another
person outside this family,

30:21.830 --> 30:24.698
before you share it with me.

30:24.733 --> 30:28.835
We have to tell each other everything.

We're in all of this together.

Timothy... what are you doing here?

30:57.916 --> 31:02.035
Well, I had a very nice talk
with our new principal last night.

31:02.037 --> 31:06.006
Turns out she's not a dilettante after all.

31:13.932 --> 31:15.715
Hey.

31:15.767 --> 31:17.968
I just found out we have
a new, old English teacher.

31:18.020 --> 31:21.972
What can I say, your daughter made a very
convincing argument. Maybe she should be the lawyer.

31:22.024 --> 31:24.891
Don't think it hasn't crossed her minds.

31:24.943 --> 31:26.943
Thank you. Thank you.

So, um, there's something
I wanted to tell you, um...

31:57.759 --> 31:58.892
I pulled a muscle in my leg.

31:58.927 --> 32:01.595
Oh my God, really?

32:01.647 --> 32:04.097
- Yeah, I can barely walk.
- Oh, my God.

I don't know if I can dance.

32:06.768 --> 32:09.653
Oh my God.

32:09.688 --> 32:12.856
Yeah. I mean I can try...

32:12.908 --> 32:16.826
No! You don't want to
really risk hurting yourself.

32:16.862 --> 32:18.862
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't be.

32:18.914 --> 32:21.615
I mean, I'm really disappointed.

32:21.667 --> 32:24.618
- So am I. [Forced chuckles]
- I really wanted you to be on the team.

32:24.670 --> 32:26.870
I really wanted to be on the team.

What are you going to
do, you need six dancers?

32:28.790 --> 32:31.091
There's got to be someone
I can find to replace you.

32:31.126 --> 32:33.126
I mean, it's not gonna be easy.

32:33.128 --> 32:35.095

- Are you sure?

32:44.806 --> 32:46.973
OK. I didn't actually hurt my leg.

32:46.975 --> 32:50.026
Duh. You can always be
honest with me, you know.

32:50.062 --> 32:53.813
Yeah? Well, honestly, never
do that sexy face again.

32:53.815 --> 32:56.983
You mean, this one.

32:57.035 --> 32:59.152
- Yeah, no, it freaks me out!
- Because you know you want me.

Idyllwild, if I can get in.

33:35.023 --> 33:38.024
Hey. I didn't know you were coming by.

33:38.076 --> 33:41.695
Well, we wanted to tell Ana, in person.

33:41.747 --> 33:43.863
Tell her what?

33:43.915 --> 33:46.967
That we're adopting the baby.

Um... [clears throat]

34:12.000 --> 34:15.802

34:17.839 --> 34:19.956
Moms aren't gonna take her baby.

34:22.177 --> 34:24.978
- Did she tell you that?
- No, I don't think she knows yet.

34:25.013 --> 34:27.213
Or maybe she does.

34:27.248 --> 34:29.132
How do you know?

34:29.184 --> 34:33.152
I just know. But please act
surprised when they tell you.

34:35.139 --> 34:38.107
I don't understand. They wanted a baby.

34:38.143 --> 34:43.196
Not Ana's baby. Even if she's your sister.

34:43.231 --> 34:47.833
They don't know anything
about who the father is

34:47.869 --> 34:50.904
and they're still grieving Frankie.

34:52.040 --> 34:53.806
You can't take this personally, OK?

34:56.878 --> 35:01.965
The reason I'm telling you this
is because Ana was really upset.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.118
I guess she's been sending letters
to her parents, trying to make amends,

35:05.153 --> 35:08.972
but they keep returning them, unopened.

35:10.058 --> 35:14.093
Do you remember, them? Your grandparents?

35:14.145 --> 35:16.813
No, I don't... I don't
think we ever met them.

35:16.848 --> 35:20.016
Well, I was thinking, since
moms aren't taking the baby,

35:20.068 --> 35:23.770
that if her parents knew
that Ana was pregnant,

35:23.805 --> 35:25.939
maybe they would take it?

35:27.275 --> 35:29.809
And that way, at least she's
being raised by her grandmother

35:29.845 --> 35:32.912
and you can get to know her.

35:35.917 --> 35:37.851
Be a part of her life.

They live pretty close.

to them you'd have their address.

found out about him.
