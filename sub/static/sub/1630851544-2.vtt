WEBVTT

00:01.067 --> 00:02.736
Previously on S.W.A.T....

00:01.067 --> 00:02.736
You're being demoted

00:02.802 --> 00:06.272
from 20-Squad leader.

00:02.802 --> 00:06.272
They want to force me to quit

00:06.339 --> 00:08.308
so they can keep
their hands clean.

00:08.375 --> 00:10.143
If you want to take
some time to decide

00:10.210 --> 00:12.779
what you want to do, just know
you helped save this city.

00:12.846 --> 00:16.649
ISABEL:
This land has been in our family
for six generations.

00:16.716 --> 00:18.785
Too long for us
to just sell it to someone.

00:18.852 --> 00:21.154
Why so mad all the time?
Especially when me and my father

00:21.221 --> 00:23.356
are offering you a very,
very, very fair deal.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.360
Is there a problem here?

00:27.427 --> 00:29.496
Where in America are you from?

00:27.427 --> 00:29.496
Los Angeles.

00:29.562 --> 00:31.564
What do you do there?

00:29.562 --> 00:31.564
I'm not sure.
That's why I came here.

00:31.631 --> 00:33.333
To figure out my next move.

00:33.400 --> 00:34.501
CHARRO:
I know you were
just trying to help

00:34.567 --> 00:35.769
Delfina Reyes
and her farm workers,

00:35.835 --> 00:38.304
but I recommend you stay away
from A.J. Novak.

00:38.371 --> 00:39.506
You mess with him,
you mess with his father.

00:39.572 --> 00:40.807
You must be the
man of the hour.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.509
And you must be
Arthur Novak.

00:42.575 --> 00:44.344
What happened the day
your husband died?

00:44.411 --> 00:45.678
We were told it was an accident.

00:45.745 --> 00:47.180
I don't think
Miguel Reyes's death was

00:47.247 --> 00:48.148
an accident.
I think he was killed.

00:48.214 --> 00:50.383
Isabel already said no
to your previous offer.

00:50.450 --> 00:52.485
Why in the hell would she ever
consider selling to you for...

00:52.552 --> 00:54.220
Delfina.

00:54.287 --> 00:55.755
Delfina, pick up the phone.
It's Daniel.

00:56.956 --> 00:59.659
I can't believe they would
take her just like that.

00:56.956 --> 00:59.659
Charro, this

00:59.726 --> 01:01.528
is your chance to do the job
you thought you signed up for.

01:01.594 --> 01:03.263
It's just us two
against all of them.

01:03.329 --> 01:06.099
There's probably something
I should tell you about myself.

01:06.166 --> 01:08.334
I'm going to postpone
leaving for TLI.

01:08.401 --> 01:11.070
You worked for months to earn
that ticket to Germany.

01:11.137 --> 01:12.539
You cannot blow that off now.

01:12.605 --> 01:15.275
Even for something
as great as me.

01:19.312 --> 01:21.247
Guten Morgen, SWAT!
Who missed us?

01:21.314 --> 01:23.783
Luca!

01:21.314 --> 01:23.783
How do you have
so much energy?

01:23.850 --> 01:25.385
The flight from Germany
was 11 hours

01:25.452 --> 01:26.586
and you were awake
the whole time.

01:26.653 --> 01:28.321
We haven't seen the
squad in three months.

01:28.388 --> 01:30.390
With our crazy TLI schedule,
the time difference...

01:30.457 --> 01:32.725
it feels like I completely
lost touch with everyone.

01:32.792 --> 01:34.194
Come on. Don't tell
me you're not pumped

01:34.260 --> 01:36.863
to catch up with
the rest of the team.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.364
All I'm saying is,
we could have dropped

01:38.431 --> 01:39.732
our bags off at home first.

01:39.799 --> 01:42.402
Chris, we are home.

01:43.770 --> 01:44.871
(growls)

01:43.770 --> 01:44.871
(laughs)

01:44.938 --> 01:46.239
Luca!

01:44.938 --> 01:46.239
Hey, man.

01:46.306 --> 01:48.141
I didn't know you
were getting in today!

01:48.208 --> 01:49.409
We wanted to surprise everyone.

01:49.476 --> 01:51.444
We? Hold up, is Chris with you?

01:51.511 --> 01:53.446
Hey, Street.

01:53.513 --> 01:55.281
Hey, Chris.

01:53.513 --> 01:55.281
You look great, man.

01:55.348 --> 01:56.449
You're hitting
the weights already.

01:55.348 --> 01:56.449
Yeah.

01:56.516 --> 01:58.451
I guess the liver donation
surgery wasn't so bad after all.

01:58.518 --> 02:00.520
Man, it kicked my ass.

02:00.587 --> 02:02.689
I couldn't get out of bed
for the first month after.

02:02.755 --> 02:03.957
How nasty is that scar, dude?

02:04.023 --> 02:06.493
It's-it's pretty nasty.

02:04.023 --> 02:06.493
Bet the ladies love it
though, huh?

02:07.794 --> 02:09.395
How's your mom doing?

02:09.462 --> 02:11.731
Good. Uh, the transplant took.

02:11.798 --> 02:14.300
She looks healthier
than she has in years.

02:11.798 --> 02:14.300
Okay.

02:14.367 --> 02:16.336
She's out of prison, too,
living at the halfway house.

02:16.402 --> 02:19.205
I visited once.
Taking it slow.

02:19.272 --> 02:21.608
Thanks for asking.

02:19.272 --> 02:21.608
I'm glad everything worked out.

02:21.674 --> 02:23.276
(phone chimes)

02:23.343 --> 02:25.144
Oh, they need me
for this last med checkup.

02:25.211 --> 02:26.546
I pass this,
I'm cleared for duty.

02:26.613 --> 02:29.249
Nice.

02:26.613 --> 02:29.249
Listen, I want to hear
about Germany, okay?

02:29.315 --> 02:30.250
All right.

02:29.315 --> 02:30.250
Catch up later?

02:30.316 --> 02:33.386
Oh! Victor Tan! 25-David!

02:30.316 --> 02:33.386
Hey!

02:33.453 --> 02:35.755
Man, am I happy to see
some friendly faces.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.557
And it's 58-David,
if you can believe it.

02:37.624 --> 02:39.659
They still got you
rolling with 50-Squad?

02:39.726 --> 02:41.394
How's Rocker treating you?

02:41.461 --> 02:42.529
Uh, like it's my
first week on the job.

02:42.595 --> 02:44.297
I spent the last month
counting ammo,

02:44.364 --> 02:46.399
lugging gear,
washing Rocker's Charger.

02:46.466 --> 02:48.401
All the times
we've embarrassed 50-Squad,

02:48.468 --> 02:50.403
you can't blame him
for piling it on a little.

02:50.470 --> 02:51.704
And now that we're back,
20-Squad

02:51.771 --> 02:53.273
will be rolling in no time.

02:53.339 --> 02:55.308
I'm not so sure about that.

02:55.375 --> 02:57.544
Been rumors 20-Squad might
not be reforming.

02:58.611 --> 03:00.380
What's that
supposed to mean?

03:00.446 --> 03:02.448
What's Hondo got
to say about this?

03:02.515 --> 03:04.183
Hondo's gone, man.

03:04.250 --> 03:06.352
He's still not back
from his personal time off.

03:06.419 --> 03:08.955
Where is he?

03:06.419 --> 03:08.955
No one's sure exactly.
He ghosted.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.590
Rumor is he's in Mexico,

03:10.657 --> 03:12.358
but nobody from SWAT's
heard from him.

03:12.425 --> 03:14.928
So he's been gone
this whole time?

03:14.994 --> 03:16.129
With no word?

03:16.195 --> 03:18.298
I checked with his dad.
He's spoken to him a few times.

03:18.364 --> 03:20.366
Nichelle, too, I think.
But other than that, crickets.

03:23.970 --> 03:26.272
A smooth trigger pull
creates accuracy.

03:26.339 --> 03:27.540
That beats speed every time.

03:27.607 --> 03:29.409
(gunfire)

03:29.475 --> 03:31.911
In a gunfight,
you can't miss fast enough.

03:35.381 --> 03:38.351
People are running
their mouths about 20-Squad

03:38.418 --> 03:40.887
shutting down, and you wait
for us to get back to find out?

03:40.954 --> 03:42.322
The hell's going on
around here?

03:42.388 --> 03:44.223
Hey, these last few months,

03:44.290 --> 03:46.559
with the two of you in Germany
and Street laid up from surgery,

03:46.626 --> 03:49.362
Tan on an extended honeymoon
and Hondo who knows where...

03:49.429 --> 03:51.764
there weren't enough bodies
to field 20-Squad.

03:51.831 --> 03:54.267
So I stepped back to
focus on the new crop

03:54.334 --> 03:55.835
of SWAT Academy recruits.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.770
After what happened
with Durham last spring,

03:57.837 --> 03:59.906
that's where I wanted
to put my energy.

03:57.837 --> 03:59.906
Okay, but we're almost all here

03:59.973 --> 04:02.508
now, enough
for a squad at least.

04:02.575 --> 04:04.510
Look, I know
Hondo got railroaded,

04:04.577 --> 04:06.312
but he'll be back at some point,

04:06.379 --> 04:08.414
and you've filled in
before.

04:08.481 --> 04:10.717
Okay, you run the show
until this team leader

04:10.783 --> 04:13.486
mess gets sorted out.

04:10.783 --> 04:13.486
There's nothing to sort out.

04:13.553 --> 04:15.922
The brass demoted Hondo.
That's final.

04:15.989 --> 04:18.458
Besides, Hicks already

04:18.524 --> 04:21.361
offered me the slot.
Permanently.

04:21.427 --> 04:23.296
You've wanted a leadership
position for a long time.

04:23.363 --> 04:25.465
Yeah, not like this.

04:25.531 --> 04:27.800
The way they forced Hondo out
for doing the right thing?

04:27.867 --> 04:30.503
Not without at least
talking to him.

04:30.570 --> 04:31.537
I owe him that.

04:31.604 --> 04:33.306
So what happens to us now?

04:33.373 --> 04:35.441
Well, without a sergeant
in charge of the team,

04:35.508 --> 04:37.543
Hicks is gonna split us up

04:37.610 --> 04:39.545
and put us on different squads.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.280
Just chopped up
and sold for parts?

04:41.347 --> 04:43.383
And what happens when Hondo
gets back? Where does he go?

04:43.449 --> 04:44.584
After the way the
department treated him?

04:44.651 --> 04:47.387
You think Hondo's
ever coming back?

04:49.422 --> 04:50.923
Slow down.

04:50.990 --> 04:52.692
So you're
a police officer?

04:52.759 --> 04:54.494
You're SWAT?

04:54.560 --> 04:57.330
There's no time to slow down.
Novak and his son have Delfina,

04:57.397 --> 04:59.465
and they're done pretending
that they play fair.

04:59.532 --> 05:00.500
Can you get her back?

04:59.532 --> 05:00.500
I'm gonna try.

05:00.566 --> 05:03.569
But I need your help.

05:00.566 --> 05:03.569
I'm not trained like you.

05:03.636 --> 05:04.771
I can't train you to be
a SWAT officer in a day,

05:04.837 --> 05:06.773
but I can teach you a few rules
that my squad lives by.

05:06.839 --> 05:08.541
And if you stick to those,
we got a chance

05:08.608 --> 05:09.776
at saving this girl's life.

05:10.843 --> 05:12.845
Okay.

05:12.912 --> 05:15.081
I'm in.

05:15.148 --> 05:18.918
Hey. Rule number one:
Never be in a hurry to die.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.787
Weapons are nice,
but we need intel.

05:20.853 --> 05:22.455
We don't know where Delfina is

05:22.522 --> 05:23.890
or how many people
are holding her.

05:23.956 --> 05:25.425
It won't be easy.

05:25.491 --> 05:26.959

and night, and his son, A.J.--

08:45.758 --> 08:48.227
he hardly takes
his eyes off her.

08:48.294 --> 08:49.896
Likes watching her suffer.

08:50.830 --> 08:53.766
I only wanted a better life
for me and Delfina.

08:53.833 --> 08:56.602
I still love her!

08:53.833 --> 08:56.602
You killed her father, man.

08:56.669 --> 08:58.638
You really think she's ever
gonna speak to you again?

08:58.704 --> 09:01.207
I didn't kill Miguel. A.J. did.

09:01.274 --> 09:03.943
After Miguel and I realized
there was silver

09:04.010 --> 09:05.745
on his land, we argued, yes.

09:05.811 --> 09:08.581
Miguel didn't care
about getting rich,

09:08.648 --> 09:10.750
even though it would've
changed our lives.

09:10.816 --> 09:12.218
So I called A.J.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.587
to see if he could
talk sense into him.

09:14.654 --> 09:17.089
A.J. said his
father would buy

09:17.156 --> 09:19.792
the land, which only
angered Miguel more.

09:19.859 --> 09:22.061
They fought and A.J.

09:22.128 --> 09:24.597
struck Miguel in the back
of the head with a pick-hammer.

09:24.664 --> 09:25.731
No.

09:25.798 --> 09:27.233
I don't buy it.

09:27.300 --> 09:28.935
You're just looking
to get yourself off the hook

09:29.001 --> 09:31.070
for all the pain
you've caused this family.

09:31.137 --> 09:32.672
I-I-I can prove it.

09:32.738 --> 09:33.572
The hammer that...

09:33.639 --> 09:36.075
A.J., he-he buried it
up in the hill.

09:36.142 --> 09:37.777
I know where
he hid it.

09:37.843 --> 09:39.278
It-It'll have his
fingerprints.

09:39.345 --> 09:41.681
Arthur's security is strong.

09:41.747 --> 09:43.749
It will take more than me
and you to get Delfina back.

09:45.985 --> 09:48.154
It's time to show us
that hammer.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.034
Tell him you need a warrant
for the Novak villa.

10:38.771 --> 10:40.706
He says...

10:38.771 --> 10:40.706
I get the idea.

11:06.232 --> 11:07.933
Been looking for you!

11:08.000 --> 11:09.402
The armored vehicle needs
another wipe-down.

11:09.468 --> 11:10.936
Are you serious?

11:11.003 --> 11:11.937
Rocker, I just scrubbed
that thing.

11:12.004 --> 11:12.938
Nah, I'm just playing.

11:13.005 --> 11:15.441
But that's no way
to talk to your team leader.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.243
I can't wait till you finally
have to stop saying that.

11:17.309 --> 11:19.678
Gonna be waiting a while then.

11:19.745 --> 11:21.080
Just spoke with Hicks.

11:21.147 --> 11:22.381
You're moving
to 50-Squad full-time.

11:22.448 --> 11:24.383
What about the rest of 20-Squad?

11:22.448 --> 11:24.383
No clue.

11:24.450 --> 11:27.086
He's posting the rest
of the assignments tomorrow.

11:27.153 --> 11:29.121
I know people get moved around
all the time, teams come and go.

11:29.188 --> 11:31.257
But 20-Squad...
I can't believe it's ending.

11:31.323 --> 11:33.459
Hey, I made you haul crap

11:33.526 --> 11:35.461
the last month, but you know

11:35.528 --> 11:37.763
it's 'cause I respect
the hell out of you, right?

11:37.830 --> 11:39.832
Our teams have had a rivalry
going back to Mumford and Buck,

11:39.899 --> 11:43.302
but you guys... came out
on top more often than not.

11:43.369 --> 11:46.305
We resented 20-Squad.

11:46.372 --> 11:48.140
But we admired you.

11:48.207 --> 11:49.742
Appreciate it, Rocker.

11:49.809 --> 11:51.477
I know it's hard
to stand out on a team

11:51.544 --> 11:54.380
that's so stacked, but
you're a great officer, Tan.

11:54.447 --> 11:56.816
You don't have to do any more
of the grunt work.

11:56.882 --> 11:59.452
You're going to be rocking
with the 50-fam for real.

12:05.791 --> 12:07.359
Luca, welcome home.

12:07.426 --> 12:10.229
Received nothing but sterling
reports from Berlin.

12:10.296 --> 12:12.198
How's it feel to be back?

12:12.264 --> 12:14.400
All looks the same,
but it sure feels different.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.435
I'm sorry about the team,
but there's something

12:16.502 --> 12:18.237
I want to talk
to you about.

12:18.304 --> 12:20.039
The city found some
extra cash squirrelled

12:20.106 --> 12:21.240
away in a sock drawer.

12:21.307 --> 12:24.944
Now they finally approved
re-staffing Cortez's position,

12:25.010 --> 12:27.413
directly under me,
overseeing all of SWAT,

12:27.480 --> 12:30.416
and I couldn't think of a more
qualified candidate for the role

12:30.483 --> 12:32.885
than you...

12:32.952 --> 12:35.087
especially with the way I heard
you crushed the leadership

12:35.154 --> 12:37.756
drills down in Germany.

12:35.154 --> 12:37.756
That would take me out
of the field for good, sir.

12:37.823 --> 12:40.226
Yeah, but you'd have
a say in all operations.

12:40.292 --> 12:41.460
Put you on a fast track

12:41.527 --> 12:43.963
for advancement
across LAPD.

12:44.029 --> 12:45.931
Just think about it, okay?

12:44.029 --> 12:45.931
Yeah, you know what?

12:45.998 --> 12:48.434
All due respect, I don't
need to-- the answer's no.

12:48.501 --> 12:51.504
I waited too long
to get back into the action.

12:52.371 --> 12:55.441
You could be running
all of SWAT one day.

12:55.508 --> 12:58.511
You need to take this seriously.

12:58.577 --> 13:01.547
All I want to do is get back
behind the wheel of Black Betty.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.516
With 20-Squad behind me.

13:03.582 --> 13:05.284
I understand
what you're chasing.

13:05.351 --> 13:07.052
Hondo's gone. 20-Squad's done.

13:07.119 --> 13:09.922
It's time to decide
what's next.

13:09.989 --> 13:12.458
Offer's not gonna be
on the table forever.

13:18.230 --> 13:19.732
Hey.

13:18.230 --> 13:19.732
Hi.

13:20.599 --> 13:22.034
Finally got you
alone.

13:22.101 --> 13:24.270
How was your, uh... checkup?

13:24.336 --> 13:26.872
Fit for duty.
Kind of blows.

13:26.939 --> 13:28.507
I mean...

13:28.574 --> 13:30.543
as soon as I'm cleared
for the field,

13:30.609 --> 13:32.411
our team gets torn apart.

13:33.479 --> 13:35.581
I'm sorry, by the way.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.550
I stopped texting the last month

13:37.616 --> 13:40.452
of your trip. It's not
that I didn't want to...

13:40.519 --> 13:42.121
I mean, I-I loved that
we were talking all the time,

13:42.188 --> 13:44.390
but, uh, surgery...

13:44.456 --> 13:47.526
it kind of did a number
on my body, so as soon

13:47.593 --> 13:49.128
as I started focusing
on coming back,

13:49.195 --> 13:50.896
it just kind of took over.

13:50.963 --> 13:52.898
It's okay, really.

13:52.965 --> 13:55.868
You weren't under any
obligation to text me.

13:57.303 --> 13:59.538
Well... we did kiss.

14:00.606 --> 14:02.841
And it was...

14:02.908 --> 14:04.510
an amazing kiss.

14:04.577 --> 14:07.313
Those usually
require follow-up.

14:07.379 --> 14:09.915
We never actually
talked about it.

14:09.982 --> 14:13.419
We talked about almost
everything but that kiss.

14:13.485 --> 14:16.989
I mean, there's no one here.

14:17.056 --> 14:18.324
We could talk about it now.

14:18.390 --> 14:21.493
Look, I still feel the same way

14:21.560 --> 14:23.596
I did when you left.

14:23.662 --> 14:25.631
I want to give us a real shot.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.533
But nothing's changed.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.568
We didn't figure anything out
like we said we would,

14:29.635 --> 14:31.971
and we still have
the same problems in our way.

14:32.037 --> 14:33.505
Well, not the biggest one.
This time tomorrow,

14:33.572 --> 14:35.507
you and I can be
on different teams.

14:35.574 --> 14:38.043
That happens, we wouldn't have
to hide a relationship.

14:42.248 --> 14:44.383
I spent this summer in the...

14:44.450 --> 14:46.318
worst pain of my life.

14:46.385 --> 14:47.886
You helped me through that.

14:47.953 --> 14:50.489
But it killed me,
being so far away from you.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.958
And I'm done pretending
that we don't have

14:53.025 --> 14:55.227
feelings for each other.

14:53.025 --> 14:55.227
Separate teams or not,

14:55.294 --> 14:59.031
I'd still be the one judged
for dating a colleague,

14:59.098 --> 15:02.434
while you get high fives from
the guys in the locker room.

15:02.501 --> 15:05.437
I just, I just need some time
to get my head around that,

15:05.504 --> 15:09.108
and-and figure out
how we can do this right.

15:09.174 --> 15:11.176
Be patient, okay?

15:16.181 --> 15:18.517
I really believed
Chief Barrera would help.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.252
I thought,
if we just opened his eyes...

15:20.319 --> 15:21.420
I know guys
like Barrera.

15:21.487 --> 15:23.022
Being a cop is
a paycheck.

15:23.088 --> 15:25.090
Not a duty.

15:27.526 --> 15:29.461
I've been fooling myself,

15:29.528 --> 15:30.663
putting this on every morning.

15:30.729 --> 15:33.632
I've felt that same anger.

15:33.699 --> 15:35.467
It's part
of why I left L.A.

15:35.534 --> 15:36.702
SWAT was like this?

15:35.534 --> 15:36.702
No.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.304
Not exactly.

15:38.370 --> 15:40.639
My squad was the best
anyone could ever ask for.

15:40.706 --> 15:42.574
And my commander,
he knew what was what.

15:42.641 --> 15:44.943
But eventually, somewhere up
the chain, a Barrera comes along

15:45.010 --> 15:47.212
and sends all the dominoes
tumbling down.

15:48.614 --> 15:52.051
And I just got tired
of picking them all back up.

15:52.117 --> 15:54.620
You can only fight
the system for so long.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.622
But Delfina is still in danger.
We can't wait for help

15:56.689 --> 15:59.058
that isn't coming.
Charro...

15:56.689 --> 15:59.058
We're just two men.

15:59.124 --> 16:00.659
I saw you
at that precinct today.

16:00.726 --> 16:02.728
You're worth more than
all those officers put together.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.129
So how do we get in?

16:04.196 --> 16:06.432
I got to get a look
at the Novak compound

16:06.498 --> 16:08.467
with my own eyes.
That's another SWAT rule.

16:08.534 --> 16:10.636
You only know
what you know.

16:10.703 --> 16:12.705
You got anything in that trunk
of yours that we can use?

16:15.708 --> 16:17.476
HONDO:
That's got to be
where they're holding Delfina.

16:17.543 --> 16:19.311
It's the only room
on the property with two guards

16:19.378 --> 16:21.580
out front.

16:19.378 --> 16:21.580
I see four more men
on patrol with rifles.

16:21.647 --> 16:24.049
HONDO: And they probably all
have sidearms of some kind, too.

16:25.784 --> 16:27.219
Even if we take them out
quietly,

16:27.286 --> 16:29.221
it won't be long
before the guards notice.

16:29.288 --> 16:31.290
There's not enough time to
get to Delfina's room and back.

16:31.357 --> 16:33.625
They patrol in a very
specific pattern.

16:33.692 --> 16:36.161
If we time it, we
could be in and out

16:36.228 --> 16:38.564
before the next guard returns.

16:38.630 --> 16:41.100
Might make a SWAT officer
out of you yet.

16:41.166 --> 16:42.768
All right,
we'll wait another hour.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.670
Make sure they stick
to the pattern.

16:44.737 --> 16:45.704
Wait a minute.

16:45.771 --> 16:47.740
It's Gabriel-- what the
hell's he doing here?

16:47.806 --> 16:50.008
(whistles)
Hey.

17:26.779 --> 17:28.714
HONDO:
They're making a run for it.

17:28.781 --> 17:30.749
I'll cover Delfina.
Keep eyes on A.J.

17:32.584 --> 17:34.486
(indistinct chatter)

17:40.259 --> 17:41.193
CHARRO:
Lost sight of A.J.

17:41.260 --> 17:42.694
They almost made it.

17:45.731 --> 17:48.133
(gunshot)

17:45.731 --> 17:48.133
(grunts)

17:56.809 --> 17:59.278
You want to defy me?!

17:56.809 --> 17:59.278
(Delfina screams)

17:59.344 --> 18:00.813
DELFINA:
No!

18:02.214 --> 18:04.650
(grunts)
Maybe you need a permanent

18:04.716 --> 18:06.852
reminder who's in charge here.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.120
(gunshot)

18:12.391 --> 18:14.693
(screams)

18:14.760 --> 18:16.829
We got to go.
Let's get her.

18:16.895 --> 18:18.764
Hondo!

18:43.288 --> 18:45.290
♪ ♪

18:53.298 --> 18:55.234
Where is Delfina now?

18:53.298 --> 18:55.234
As far as we know,

18:55.300 --> 18:56.401
still at the Novak compound.

18:56.468 --> 18:58.504
All this for some rocks
in the ground?

18:58.570 --> 19:00.806
He can have it, all of them.

19:00.873 --> 19:02.307
I don't care.

19:02.374 --> 19:04.576
I just want Delfina back home.

19:04.643 --> 19:06.278
We can't trust Señor Novak.

19:06.345 --> 19:08.514
Once he gets what he wants,
he'll still hurt Delfina.

19:08.580 --> 19:10.349
He has my daughter, Officer.

19:10.415 --> 19:12.284
I have to do something.

19:12.351 --> 19:15.153
Some kind of concession.

19:15.220 --> 19:16.221
HONDO: She's right,
Charro, the only thing

19:16.288 --> 19:18.323
keeping Delfina alive is
the deed to this property.

19:18.390 --> 19:20.492
I'll make the call to
Novak and set it up.

19:22.694 --> 19:25.464
I saw what A.J. was
about to do to Delfina.

19:25.531 --> 19:27.699
You had to kill him.

19:27.766 --> 19:30.602
We both know this is more
than just about land now.

19:30.669 --> 19:33.539
Even with a signed deed,
Novak will come looking for you.

19:33.605 --> 19:35.541
I am not worried
about me.

19:35.607 --> 19:38.377
Isabel and Delfina will
never be safe so long as he

19:38.443 --> 19:40.445
still controls this town.
You have to do something.

19:42.414 --> 19:43.949
Maybe if I had my team
and my badge,

19:44.016 --> 19:45.684
things would be different,
but I don't.

19:46.985 --> 19:49.288
So right now we play
the only card that we have.

19:49.354 --> 19:51.523
We give Novak what he wants.

19:51.590 --> 19:53.392
I'll do it.

19:53.458 --> 19:55.394
I'll arrange to get him the deed
and make sure Delfina is safe.

19:55.460 --> 19:57.796
This isn't your mess
to clean up.

19:55.460 --> 19:57.796
It's not yours, either.

19:57.863 --> 20:00.299
You should get
out of Mexico now.

20:00.365 --> 20:02.367
While you still can.

20:05.837 --> 20:08.273
DEACON:
We all know what's
coming tomorrow.

20:08.340 --> 20:10.242
Didn't feel right
to end the shift

20:10.309 --> 20:12.344
without getting
together as a team

20:12.411 --> 20:14.580
to say goodbye.

20:12.411 --> 20:14.580
Almost the whole team.

20:14.646 --> 20:15.981
Hondo's always a part of us.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.617
Kills me, he's gonna come back,
his team'll be gone.

20:18.684 --> 20:20.619
I hate to be that guy,
but he's not coming back.

20:20.686 --> 20:22.788
Otherwise, he
would've already.

20:22.854 --> 20:23.822
He tried to hold
LAPD accountable

20:23.889 --> 20:24.923
and they threw him
under the bus.

20:24.990 --> 20:26.792
I wouldn't come back,
either.

20:26.858 --> 20:29.294
Hondo's been on the force
almost his whole life.

20:29.361 --> 20:31.263
What's he gonna do
if he's not a cop anymore?

20:31.330 --> 20:32.230
I know what
he'd want us to do now.

20:32.297 --> 20:33.799
Finish the shift like
it's any other day.

20:33.865 --> 20:36.568
Which means it has
to be perfect.

20:36.635 --> 20:38.337
Guess 50-Squad won't be so bad.

20:38.403 --> 20:39.805
Feel sorry for the team
that gets stuck

20:39.871 --> 20:41.607
with Street though.

20:39.871 --> 20:41.607
Oh, please.

20:41.673 --> 20:43.675
Any squad that gets me is
automatically better

20:43.742 --> 20:45.978
than yours.

20:43.742 --> 20:45.978
What about you?

20:46.044 --> 20:48.680
You looking forward
to what's next?

20:48.747 --> 20:50.515
Yeah.

20:50.582 --> 20:52.417
Maybe it's time for a change.

20:53.719 --> 20:55.420
(phones beeping)

20:55.487 --> 20:56.989
You guys are seeing this, too?

20:57.055 --> 20:58.657
Why we all getting
the same SWAT alert?

21:01.460 --> 21:02.894
What's going on?

21:01.460 --> 21:02.894
Suit up.

21:02.961 --> 21:05.030
Our squad's rolling
to a bank robbery in South L.A.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.431
Why did 20-Squad
get an alert?

21:06.498 --> 21:07.733
Second call just came in.

21:07.799 --> 21:09.334
Officers under fire
on the west side.

21:09.401 --> 21:10.769
50-Squad's the only team

21:10.836 --> 21:12.471
on duty and they can't
be in two places

21:12.537 --> 21:13.472
at once.
I hate to ask it, but...

21:13.538 --> 21:15.474
20-Squad is present
and accounted for, sir.

21:15.540 --> 21:17.309
We'll take the call.

21:15.540 --> 21:17.309
Never doubted it.

21:19.678 --> 21:21.313
We can roll a man down, Tan.

21:21.380 --> 21:23.615
Finish it out with 20-Squad.
They need you.

21:27.486 --> 21:29.421
Officers responded
to a trespassing call.

21:29.488 --> 21:31.890
Some locals thought
they saw some teens hanging

21:31.957 --> 21:34.326
around a mall.
It's been closed for years.

21:34.393 --> 21:36.361
Instead of kids, officers found
an amateur meth operation.

21:36.428 --> 21:38.063
Apparently,
some aspiring cooks

21:38.130 --> 21:39.464
have been using
the mall rent-free.

21:39.531 --> 21:40.399
How'd they respond

21:40.465 --> 21:41.633
to their private kitchen
being discovered?

21:41.700 --> 21:43.402
With bullets.

21:43.468 --> 21:44.936
Thankfully,
the unis made it out safe.

21:45.003 --> 21:46.705
The shooters are pinned down
in a department store.

21:46.772 --> 21:49.307
All right, let's set up
a perimeter and see

21:49.374 --> 21:50.542
if we can end this
as clean as possible.

21:50.609 --> 21:52.444
It's probably our last ride.

21:52.511 --> 21:53.979
Let's fill the gaps.

21:54.046 --> 21:57.416
Stay liquid.
Let's make Hondo proud.

22:03.755 --> 22:05.657
(indistinct radio chatter)

22:05.724 --> 22:07.926
Everyone okay? Anyone hurt?

22:05.724 --> 22:07.926
Just a little winded.

22:07.993 --> 22:10.362
Got out as fast as we could.
Lost track of the kids, though.

22:10.429 --> 22:11.830
Wait. Hold on, what kids?

22:11.897 --> 22:13.498
The ones we found using
the fountain as a skate park.

22:13.565 --> 22:16.001
They ran, so we
chased them inside.

22:16.068 --> 22:17.836
That's when we found the lab.
All of a sudden,

22:17.903 --> 22:19.004
we were under fire.

22:19.071 --> 22:20.772
Three shooters,
messed up on something.

22:20.839 --> 22:22.441
So there's still kids inside?

22:23.675 --> 22:24.710
Look, this barricade
could pop off

22:24.776 --> 22:26.111
into a hostage situation.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.412
We can't just sweat
these shooters out.

All right, when patrol

22:28.513 --> 22:30.115
gets here, set up a perimeter.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.417
Cover all the exits.
No one gets out

22:32.484 --> 22:33.652

Nice of you to stay in town.

25:47.145 --> 25:48.813
The love a parent has
for their child

25:48.880 --> 25:50.548
is a powerful thing, isn't it?

25:50.615 --> 25:52.150
Do we have a deal?

25:52.217 --> 25:53.551

Yes, we have a deal.

But I make

25:57.122 --> 25:58.957

Sunrise.

Seeing him brought in
like this,

36:20.611 --> 36:22.380
Barrera had no other choice

36:22.446 --> 36:23.748
without losing the support
of the entire town.

36:23.814 --> 36:25.483
The world's full
of men like him.

Happy to do the right thing

If we wait for our leaders

36:31.589 --> 36:33.558
we will be waiting too long.

36:33.624 --> 36:35.493
We need to make them follow us.

36:35.560 --> 36:37.595
This town is lucky
to have you, Charro.

36:38.763 --> 36:39.764
Thank you.

36:39.830 --> 36:41.399
What will you do next?

36:42.233 --> 36:44.535
Right now, the only thing
I need to do is get

36:44.602 --> 36:45.770
that girl home to her mother.

36:45.836 --> 36:47.672
You keep this place safe.

37:15.600 --> 37:17.368
Looks like I won't need
to be getting

37:17.435 --> 37:18.502
my hands dirty any time soon.

37:18.569 --> 37:20.004
(laughs)

37:20.071 --> 37:22.440
With A.J. dead,
his father in jail,

37:22.506 --> 37:24.575
they have nothing
to be afraid of.

37:24.642 --> 37:27.511
And Charro promised
to keep an extra eye on things,

37:27.578 --> 37:29.780
just in case.

37:27.578 --> 37:29.780
Oh, did he now?

37:29.847 --> 37:32.583
What?

37:29.847 --> 37:32.583
I saw
you two chatting.

37:32.650 --> 37:33.551
I don't think
the farm's the only thing

37:33.618 --> 37:34.719
Charro's got his eyes on.

37:36.520 --> 37:38.856
Takes a whole family
to run this place.

37:38.923 --> 37:40.858
And my mother deserves to relax.

37:40.925 --> 37:42.994
Well, you can always sell...
for the real value.

37:43.060 --> 37:45.463
You know
about the silver now.

37:45.529 --> 37:47.431
And it is
life-changing money.

37:47.498 --> 37:49.867
I know, but
my father died

37:49.934 --> 37:52.003
to keep this land
in our family.

37:52.069 --> 37:54.438
I want to honor that.

37:54.505 --> 37:56.707
The day may come when
we need to reconsider,

37:56.774 --> 38:00.544
but on that day, it'll be
our family's decision alone.

38:00.611 --> 38:01.912
No one else's.

38:01.979 --> 38:04.482
When I come back around,
I'm gonna cook a meal

38:04.548 --> 38:06.350
for you and your mom.

38:04.548 --> 38:06.350
You're leaving?

38:06.417 --> 38:07.585
I got what I needed.

38:07.652 --> 38:09.353
Good.

38:09.420 --> 38:11.722
Thank you. For everything.

38:19.997 --> 38:23.067
Hey! You never told me
what you do back home.

38:24.702 --> 38:26.704
I help people.

38:39.750 --> 38:41.385
New team assignments.

38:41.452 --> 38:43.421
I need your final approval.

38:45.489 --> 38:47.525
It's a damn fine showing
by 20-Squad yesterday.

38:47.591 --> 38:49.827
You made the right call
sending in the team.

38:49.894 --> 38:51.829
Yeah, with those kids inside,
wasn't much of a choice.

38:51.896 --> 38:54.598
Well, still. Lot of ways
that could have gone sideways.

38:54.665 --> 38:55.866
You led them well.

38:55.933 --> 38:57.401
Commander, it's
not a question

38:57.468 --> 38:59.003
of if I can do the job.

38:59.070 --> 39:01.572
I know I can.

39:01.639 --> 39:03.441
But in the last four years,

39:03.507 --> 39:05.776
I have learned that there's
other ways to lead.

39:05.843 --> 39:08.079
I spent the entire summer
training and vetting

39:08.145 --> 39:10.681
these cadets to make sure
that the next batch

39:10.748 --> 39:12.550
of officers doesn't have
a single bad apple in it.

39:12.616 --> 39:14.618
That's where I'm
needed right now.

39:14.685 --> 39:16.787
I can't do that and lead
a team at the same time.

39:16.854 --> 39:18.489
Message received, Sergeant.

39:18.556 --> 39:20.825
There is no 20-Squad
without Hondo.

39:22.159 --> 39:25.096
You want to thank somebody
for yesterday's mission?

39:25.162 --> 39:27.131
You can thank him.

39:25.162 --> 39:27.131
Well, I'd love to.

39:27.198 --> 39:29.967
But he's not returning my calls.

39:31.535 --> 39:33.971
Who do you think
pushed him to that point?

39:34.839 --> 39:39.043
I did everything I could
to protect Hondo's job.

39:39.110 --> 39:42.146
He went to the press
behind all our backs.

39:43.514 --> 39:45.583
The brass demanded blood.

39:45.649 --> 39:47.585
End of story.

39:45.649 --> 39:47.585
Yeah.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.856
But there was a time
when the brass wanted your head.

39:51.922 --> 39:53.691
After Erika's death.

39:53.758 --> 39:55.659
And Hondo told them
if they fired you,

39:55.726 --> 39:57.094
they'd have to
fire him, too.

40:00.197 --> 40:02.433
There's always
another move to make.

40:11.175 --> 40:13.410
I'll tell 20-Squad
their new assignments.

40:16.013 --> 40:16.680
CHRIS:
You think you'll be the drivr

40:16.747 --> 40:18.415
on your new team, Luca?

40:16.747 --> 40:18.415
Sure.

40:18.482 --> 40:19.917
I'll just go to whoever
their old driver is

40:19.984 --> 40:22.686
and say,
"Let's arm wrestle for it."

40:22.753 --> 40:24.588
Black Betty doesn't
like other guys

40:24.655 --> 40:27.091
putting their hands on her.

40:24.655 --> 40:27.091
Whoa, hold up,
why do you get Betty?

40:27.158 --> 40:28.826
I thought we'd all, like,
share custody or something.

40:28.893 --> 40:31.495
Mm-mm.

40:28.893 --> 40:31.495
Hey, uh, you guys think

40:31.562 --> 40:33.931
I should go by Jim
on my new squad?

40:33.998 --> 40:35.099
This could be my big chance
to reinvent myself.

40:35.166 --> 40:37.101
I hate to break it
to you, Street.

40:37.168 --> 40:38.435
No one's ever gonna
call you Jim.

40:38.502 --> 40:40.471
Hey.

40:41.539 --> 40:43.040
Got your new assignments.

40:43.107 --> 40:45.910
Listen, wherever you all end up,

40:45.976 --> 40:48.212
just remember what
Hondo would always say.

40:48.279 --> 40:50.214
Never be in a hurry to die?

40:50.281 --> 40:51.849
You only know what you know?

40:51.916 --> 40:52.983
Never lose your cool?

40:53.050 --> 40:55.085
No. His golden rule.

40:55.152 --> 40:57.454
Treat 'em like family.

41:00.057 --> 41:02.126
Hondo.

41:16.941 --> 41:18.576
It's time to get back to work.

41:18.642 --> 41:19.810
Yeah, baby!

41:19.877 --> 41:21.078
You're back!
Welcome back, Hondo.

41:21.145 --> 41:22.246
Yeah!

41:22.313 --> 41:23.981
Hell yeah!

41:24.048 --> 41:26.150
Oh, I missed you,
brother.

41:27.551 --> 41:28.886
How's my team, hmm?

41:28.953 --> 41:30.588

41:30.654 --> 41:32.523
