00:01.101 --> 00:02.935
<i>You're watching</i>
The Last Man on Earth.

00:02.937 --> 00:04.436
Yes!

00:04.438 --> 00:05.971
<i>Catch all-new episodes Sundays.</i>

00:05.973 --> 00:08.140
<i>And check out</i>
<i>our other Fox programs,</i>

00:08.142 --> 00:09.708
Bob's Burgers--
Whoo!

00:09.710 --> 00:11.977
Brooklyn Nine-Nine
<i>and</i> Family Guy.

00:11.979 --> 00:14.546
-Can me and Ramon
go ride shirtless bikes?
-(sighs)

00:14.548 --> 00:15.681
<i>Only on Fox.</i>

00:16.950 --> 00:19.051
<i>Previously</i>
<i>on</i> The Last Man on Earth...

00:19.053 --> 00:21.620
I figured it out, man.
We're going to Akron!

00:21.622 --> 00:22.688
<i>That's where's Melissa's from.</i>

00:22.690 --> 00:23.889
<i>Who knows what we could learn?</i>

00:23.891 --> 00:25.824
Melissa, you just took a pill.

00:25.826 --> 00:27.059
<i>Only one left.</i>

00:27.061 --> 00:30.062
Let's take your
dumb-ass family photo.

00:30.064 --> 00:31.730
BOTH: Limburger! Limburger!
Limburger!
(camera shutter clicking)

00:31.732 --> 00:35.267
Jiminy Glick.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.506
Thank you, everyone, for coming.

00:40.508 --> 00:41.740
Please take a seat.

00:41.742 --> 00:43.042
You'll notice I've placed a hat

00:43.044 --> 00:45.244
in front of each of you.

00:45.246 --> 00:46.912
You're gonna want
to hold onto it.

00:46.914 --> 00:48.414
What's going on, Care Bear?

00:48.416 --> 00:51.383
Just a seismic shift in reality
as we know it.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.419
What you're about to see

00:53.421 --> 00:56.088
will shock and astound you
to your very core.

00:56.090 --> 00:57.389
For the weak of stomach,

00:57.391 --> 00:59.691
feel free to use the hat
as a barf bag.

00:59.693 --> 01:00.893
And now,

01:00.895 --> 01:05.064
prepare to question everything.
Behold!

01:05.066 --> 01:06.765
Cute!
Ah!

01:06.767 --> 01:08.567
Oh, those came out good.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.936
No. Look closer...
in the background.

01:10.938 --> 01:12.938
TODD: Wait.
What-what is that thing?

01:12.940 --> 01:15.407
It-It's probably just
some tiny acorn.

01:15.409 --> 01:18.077
You got to remember,
the camera adds ten pounds.

01:18.079 --> 01:20.379
Ever tried to take a picture
of a scale on zero?

01:20.381 --> 01:21.580
Can't do it.
Huh.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.082
It'll always say ten.

01:23.084 --> 01:25.884
Tandy, I thought it was
an obese acorn myself

01:25.886 --> 01:27.519
until I did this.

01:28.455 --> 01:30.289
TODD:
Oh, my God.
(Erica gasps)

01:30.291 --> 01:32.591
What is that?
(gasps)

01:32.593 --> 01:33.625
It's moving!

01:33.627 --> 01:35.461
Looks like we have company.

01:35.463 --> 01:38.430
And that company... is a Yoda.

01:40.967 --> 01:43.235
TANDY (à la Yoda):
Find this thing

01:43.237 --> 01:44.603
we need to.
CAROL:
Tandy,

01:44.605 --> 01:47.106
I think you mean "Find this
thing to which we need."

01:47.108 --> 01:48.407
Oh. Sorry.

01:48.409 --> 01:50.242
We don't even
know what that is.

01:50.244 --> 01:51.810
Oh, it's pretty clearly a Yoda.

01:51.812 --> 01:52.811
TANDY: Think we're
making a mistake

01:52.813 --> 01:54.113
by putting all our eggs

01:54.115 --> 01:55.280
in this Yoda basket.

01:55.282 --> 01:56.982
I mean, could be
some sort of gremlin

01:56.984 --> 01:58.484
or yeti or troll.

01:58.486 --> 02:00.385
Oh, wait.
No, trolls don't exist.

02:00.387 --> 02:02.788
But, look, there's also a chance
we could be looking

02:02.790 --> 02:05.324
at a board-certified
medical doctor.

02:05.326 --> 02:07.759
What if it's another
crazy person like Pat?

02:07.761 --> 02:09.161
Yeah, if they were friendly,

02:09.163 --> 02:11.163
wouldn't they have
introduced themselves already?

02:11.165 --> 02:14.166
If they were harmful, wouldn't
they have hurt us already?

02:14.168 --> 02:16.502
Well, okay, well, why wouldn't
they have said anything?

02:16.504 --> 02:19.671
(stammers) We're probably just
dealing with a shy individual.

02:19.673 --> 02:22.474
Most people are scared to engage
others in conversation.

02:22.476 --> 02:25.077
That's why, if you ever see me
at a social event,

02:25.079 --> 02:26.411
no one's ever talking to me.

02:26.413 --> 02:27.846
CAROL:
Tandy, look,

02:27.848 --> 02:30.349
Gail's injured.
Todd, you have to take care of

02:30.351 --> 02:31.517
Melissa. I just

02:31.519 --> 02:33.152
don't think the group can handle

02:33.154 --> 02:35.020
a full-on manhunt right now.

02:35.022 --> 02:37.089
No, we have to do this.

02:37.091 --> 02:40.025
Look, Lewis gave his life
trying to find a doctor for us.

02:40.027 --> 02:42.194
And if he knew
there was someone out there

02:42.196 --> 02:43.829
and we weren't doing
everything we could

02:43.831 --> 02:46.865
to try to find them, he'd be
rolling over in his ashes.

02:46.867 --> 02:49.001
That is a good point.

02:49.003 --> 02:50.302
Yeah.

02:50.304 --> 02:51.703
We'll do it for Lewis.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.705
Oh, thank you.

02:53.707 --> 02:55.774
As Lewis used to say,

02:55.776 --> 02:58.076
"That's great."

03:02.849 --> 03:05.517
Oh. There she is.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.553
(laughs)
Yeah, I was just,

03:07.555 --> 03:10.389
uh, putting up
some pictures

03:10.391 --> 03:12.357
you brought
back from Akron.

03:12.359 --> 03:13.392
Okay.

03:16.529 --> 03:19.064
Melissa,

03:19.066 --> 03:20.365
can you, can you look at me?

03:20.367 --> 03:22.301
Please? Um,

03:22.303 --> 03:25.204
you remember this pill?

03:25.206 --> 03:27.139
Huh?

03:27.141 --> 03:29.074
You-you took one of
'em back in Akron.

03:29.076 --> 03:31.577
Melissa.

03:31.579 --> 03:32.878
(sighs)

03:32.880 --> 03:35.414
God. Hon, what are
you thinking about?

03:35.416 --> 03:37.316
Santa's penis.

03:37.318 --> 03:40.085
Okay. Can-can we please
focus here, all right?

03:40.087 --> 03:42.588
I need to know
what this pill is.

03:42.590 --> 03:44.256
Santa's penis.

03:44.258 --> 03:45.757
Okay, now, I know

03:45.759 --> 03:48.994
you think it's funny talking
about Santa's genitalia,

03:48.996 --> 03:50.529
and it is, okay?

03:50.531 --> 03:52.064
It's funny imagery

03:52.066 --> 03:55.934
because of his body size
and white pubic hair, but

03:55.936 --> 03:57.936
there's a time
and a place.

03:57.938 --> 04:01.106
Okay? And right now
I need your help.

04:01.108 --> 04:02.608
Santa's penis?
Oh.

04:02.610 --> 04:04.109
Great. Well,

04:04.111 --> 04:06.445
guess I'm gonna have
to figure this out on my own.

04:06.447 --> 04:07.713
Yeah, thanks a lot.

04:07.715 --> 04:10.582
(clears throat)

04:10.584 --> 04:14.786
TANDY:
Yeah, this is the spot.

04:14.788 --> 04:17.256
All right, you see any clues?

04:17.258 --> 04:19.758
Any droppings which might
help us shed some light

04:19.760 --> 04:22.461
on the nature of this
potentially dangerous beast?

04:24.297 --> 04:26.465
Look, look over there.
There's a house.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.468
TANDY (quietly):
Oh, my God.

04:29.470 --> 04:32.471
All right, let's go get back
in the van and check it out.

04:32.473 --> 04:35.140
(quietly): Guys, I can't
see the van.

04:35.142 --> 04:37.709
Huh.

04:40.647 --> 04:41.647
(car lock remote chirps)

04:41.649 --> 04:43.115
Oh, there it is.
Oh.

04:43.117 --> 04:44.716
Over in that area.

04:44.718 --> 04:47.786
Don't forget the...
Tandy, all the stuff.

04:47.788 --> 04:51.990
TANDY:
Oh, left my friggin'
binoculars and my picture.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.725
Ah, Mondays.

04:54.661 --> 04:58.330
TANDY:
Be very quiet.

04:58.332 --> 05:00.799
Okay.
Tandy.

05:00.801 --> 05:03.468
(whispering):
You guys wait in here, okay?

05:03.470 --> 05:05.804
I'm gonna go make sure
it's safe.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.606
(whispering):
How will you let us know?

05:07.608 --> 05:09.341
I'll make a bird sound.

05:09.343 --> 05:12.010
Birds don't exist. They're
gonna know someone's here.

05:12.012 --> 05:15.213
Okay, I'll make a wind sound.

05:31.964 --> 05:35.067
(door creaks open)

05:41.941 --> 05:44.009
(exhales loudly)

05:46.379 --> 05:48.547
Oh, gol, he's choking!
He's choking.

05:48.549 --> 05:50.015
(exhales loudly)
ERICA:
No.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.617
I think he's making
his wind sound.

05:55.221 --> 05:57.456
(exhales loudly)

05:57.458 --> 06:00.258
Yeah, he's doing wind.

06:01.294 --> 06:03.695
(groans)

06:03.697 --> 06:04.896
Hey, Todd?

06:04.898 --> 06:06.898
Ah.
Can I ask you a little favor?

06:06.900 --> 06:08.367
Uh, you know, I'm kind of busy
at the moment.

06:08.369 --> 06:09.868
Well, I know.
I was just hoping

06:09.870 --> 06:11.570
that you could
go grab my accordion?

06:11.572 --> 06:13.572
I-I left it over
in that elevator,

06:13.574 --> 06:16.174
and I'm having a whale
of a time with the stairs.

06:16.176 --> 06:18.009
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Can this wait?
Hmm.

06:18.011 --> 06:19.344
It's kind of an emergency.

06:19.346 --> 06:21.213
I got this Thin Lizzy song
stuck in my head,

06:21.215 --> 06:23.648
and I need to just put it
to my fingers.
It's just,

06:23.650 --> 06:25.317
you know, I got to focus
on Melissa right now.

06:25.319 --> 06:26.651
She used to take this pill,
you know,

06:26.653 --> 06:28.086
and I got to figure out
what it is.

06:28.088 --> 06:29.554
She won't just tell you?

06:29.556 --> 06:30.822
No, she's being
very uncooperative.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.591
All she talks about is
Santa's penis.

06:32.593 --> 06:35.093
What'd she say about it?
I don't know.

06:35.095 --> 06:36.862
I think she's messing around,
but I'm gonna go see

06:36.864 --> 06:38.730
if I can find a match
at the pharmacy.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.265
Do you want a little help?

06:40.267 --> 06:41.666
Shouldn't you be resting up?

06:41.668 --> 06:44.002
You forget
who you're dealing with here.

06:58.618 --> 07:03.121
(à la Yoda):
Found our Yoda,
looks like we did.

07:09.195 --> 07:10.629
Well, this is our guy.

07:11.631 --> 07:13.598
Let's see what we got here.

07:13.600 --> 07:17.135
Games, mostly single-player
in nature.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.970
Guy's a lone wolf.

07:18.972 --> 07:21.106
Ah, Hungry Hungry Hippo.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.908
But no marbles for them to eat.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.509
Potential sociopath.

07:25.411 --> 07:28.180
Soda, huh.

07:31.484 --> 07:33.385
That's pee, yeah.

07:33.387 --> 07:36.154
Or wait, is that ginger ale?

07:36.156 --> 07:37.656
No, pee.

07:38.991 --> 07:40.158
Monopoly.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.894
Healthy interest in real estate,
a capitalist.

07:42.896 --> 07:45.397
And if I'm to believe
all the recommended ages

07:45.399 --> 07:48.066
on the board games,
we're dealing with an individual

07:48.068 --> 07:50.936
between the ages of eight
and 80.

07:50.938 --> 07:52.838
So who are you,

07:52.840 --> 07:55.807
you young or elderly punk?

07:55.809 --> 07:58.310
Tandy, I think it's pretty
obvious it's a little boy.

07:58.312 --> 08:00.345
I mean, look at these toys.

08:00.347 --> 08:02.681
There's forks in the
electrical sockets,

08:02.683 --> 08:04.416
and this costume is tiny.

08:04.418 --> 08:06.284
Well, not so fast, Erica.

08:06.286 --> 08:08.820
We might just be dealing
with a Benjamin Buttons type,

08:08.822 --> 08:11.189
so we must use an abundance
of caution.

08:11.191 --> 08:14.593
For though small in stature,
he's lived a lifetime.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.962
<i>Benjamin Buttons--</i>
that's a movie.

08:16.964 --> 08:18.864
Based on the actual curious case

08:18.866 --> 08:21.433
of the very real Benji Buttons.

08:21.435 --> 08:24.836
It's Benjamin Button,
and it was a book.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.805
I think the word you're looking
for is "novel."

08:26.807 --> 08:28.773
You can take that from someone
who's read one.

08:28.775 --> 08:30.876
Guys, check these out.

08:32.545 --> 08:34.513
Man on fish porn.

08:34.515 --> 08:38.550
It's rather crude, but, uh,
she'll get the job done.

08:38.552 --> 08:40.719
No, Tandy. That's you

08:40.721 --> 08:42.053
giving mouth-to-mouth
to Gail the Fish

08:42.055 --> 08:44.122
that night we were camping.

08:44.124 --> 08:46.057
Wow. He must
have been watching us.

08:46.059 --> 08:48.159
Oh, yeah.
That's what that is.

08:48.161 --> 08:49.327
(laughing):
That's cute.

08:49.329 --> 08:50.996
He's celebrating me.

08:50.998 --> 08:53.832
He's got some sort
of hero deal going on.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.066
I'm just a man.

08:55.068 --> 08:56.902
I just feel so bad

08:56.904 --> 09:00.071
that this child's living here
all by himself in this mess.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.406
ERICA: Yeah.
Yeah.

09:01.408 --> 09:04.009
It takes me back to my days
in Tucson.

09:04.011 --> 09:07.112
I thought I was
the only one left.

09:08.881 --> 09:11.249
Well, look, whatever it is,

09:11.251 --> 09:14.986
whether it's a toddler
or a Benji, it needs us.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.922
Yeah, so what
are we gonna do?

09:16.924 --> 09:19.057
We just got to draw him
out of hiding.

09:19.059 --> 09:22.761
And I have just the thing.

09:22.763 --> 09:25.997
Oh, look.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.699
Let's see.
I think I might
have found one.

09:27.701 --> 09:29.267
Huh? Oh, let's see it.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.436
White, circular, no markings.

09:31.438 --> 09:33.672
You know, let's put it
with the maybes.

09:34.774 --> 09:37.609
Ooh, what have we here?

09:37.611 --> 09:41.046
Oh, come on, Gail,
that's a Xanax.

09:41.048 --> 09:42.948
Yeah, but are we sure?

09:42.950 --> 09:45.584
Better check it out
just in case.

09:45.586 --> 09:47.919
Look, can we focus here? Huh?
Uh...

09:47.921 --> 09:49.588
Just hand me
the pill, please.

09:49.590 --> 09:50.755
The pill, Gail.

09:50.757 --> 09:51.923
Oh...

09:51.925 --> 09:53.058
The pill.

09:53.060 --> 09:54.292
Uh...
What?

09:54.294 --> 09:55.760
Where is it?

09:55.762 --> 09:58.096
Okay, Todd.
The good news is

09:58.098 --> 10:00.432
it is in the vicinity.

10:00.434 --> 10:01.600
What?

10:01.602 --> 10:03.635
Uh, I think it
is this guy...

10:03.637 --> 10:06.605
Oh, wait. It's this guy, or...

10:06.607 --> 10:09.140
Todd, I done lost the pill.

10:09.142 --> 10:10.809
Oh, come on, Gail.

10:10.811 --> 10:12.644
(through clenched teeth):
Damn it!

10:15.147 --> 10:18.149
Candy! Come get your candy!

10:18.151 --> 10:21.319
(whoops and laughs)

10:21.321 --> 10:24.923
Oh, my goodness,
this is delicious candy!

10:24.925 --> 10:26.891
And there's so much of it!

10:26.893 --> 10:28.994
(hoots and whoops)

10:28.996 --> 10:30.662
Hey, and if candy's
not your bag,

10:30.664 --> 10:32.998
we've got a whole slew of items

10:33.000 --> 10:35.433
catering to a more
experienced taste.

10:35.435 --> 10:37.268
Talking to you, Benji!

10:37.270 --> 10:38.670
Yeah, we got, uh...

10:38.672 --> 10:41.339
Metamucil, BluBlockers,

10:41.341 --> 10:43.074
hearing aids,

10:43.076 --> 10:45.510
couple<i> Judging Amy</i> DVDs,

10:45.512 --> 10:48.647
you got a box
of Depends diapie-diaps.

10:48.649 --> 10:50.815
It's a world
of pure imagination

10:50.817 --> 10:52.350
for young and old alike.

10:52.352 --> 10:54.586
♪ It's raining Fixodent! ♪

10:58.457 --> 11:01.760
Todd, the results are in.

11:01.762 --> 11:05.597
That pill tested
positive for Xanax.

11:05.599 --> 11:08.033
Gail, that pill
was our only lead.

11:08.035 --> 11:09.768
I said I was sorry.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.202
It doesn't seem
like you are.

11:11.204 --> 11:12.871
Well, I am.

11:12.873 --> 11:15.407
Well, then I guess
all is forgiven.

11:24.850 --> 11:29.554
Todd... Todd.

11:29.556 --> 11:31.122
(singsongy):
Todd.

11:31.124 --> 11:32.791
What?

11:32.793 --> 11:34.959
Will you drop me off
at the other building, please?

11:34.961 --> 11:36.361
Why?

11:36.363 --> 11:38.129
Because I have to get

11:38.131 --> 11:40.899
my accordion
out of the elevator.

11:40.901 --> 11:43.068
I guess you're not
gonna do it,

11:43.070 --> 11:44.736
so I guess
I'm gonna do it.

11:44.738 --> 11:46.237
No, I'll get it.

11:46.239 --> 11:48.239
Well, don't do me
any favors.

11:48.241 --> 11:50.075
Look, I said I'll
get it, I'll get it.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.576
Huh.

11:51.578 --> 11:53.978
You know what?

11:53.980 --> 11:55.613
I'm gonna put this right here.

11:58.584 --> 12:00.585
That is good
for what you got.

12:00.587 --> 12:02.554
Great. Thank you.

12:02.556 --> 12:04.155
You're welcome.

12:04.157 --> 12:05.924
TANDY:<i> Well,</i>
<i>the T-shirt cannons worked.</i>

12:05.926 --> 12:07.225
You found the kid?

12:07.227 --> 12:08.827
No, I just mean they shot off

12:08.829 --> 12:10.562
everything I put in there
very, very far... yes.

12:10.564 --> 12:13.765
So you guys, uh, cleaned up
this whole house?

12:13.767 --> 12:14.999
Yeah, we thought
we'd make it nice

12:15.001 --> 12:17.268
for when this kid comes back.

12:17.270 --> 12:20.105
Kids love a clean room.

12:20.107 --> 12:24.109
Yeah. Yep, they sure do.

12:24.111 --> 12:25.376
Hey, Carol.

12:25.378 --> 12:27.779
Remember when we first
met back in Tucson?

12:27.781 --> 12:29.280
And how you cleaned up my house?

12:29.282 --> 12:31.549
You know, I don't think I ever
got a thank you for that.

12:31.551 --> 12:34.085
And I never got an apology.
Excuse me?

12:34.087 --> 12:36.087
I just didn't want you
messing with my stuff.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.623
And I don't think this kid wants
us messing with his.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.125
He wants us to leave.

12:40.127 --> 12:41.392
But guess what.

12:41.394 --> 12:44.295
That's not gonna happen,
'cause I have a plan.

12:44.297 --> 12:45.296
What are we gonna do?

12:45.298 --> 12:47.365
We're gonna leave.

12:54.473 --> 12:55.874
CAROL:
Tandy.

12:55.876 --> 12:57.876
We can't just leave.

12:57.878 --> 13:00.712
Don't you see?!
He doesn't want us here!

13:00.714 --> 13:02.914
We have to leave!

13:02.916 --> 13:05.283
And we're never coming back!

13:09.054 --> 13:11.222
CAROL:
<i>I know this is frustrating,</i>
<i>Tandy,</i>

13:11.224 --> 13:14.392
but it might just take this kid
a little while to warm up to us.

13:14.394 --> 13:16.394
You know,
when I was 11,

13:16.396 --> 13:18.496
we had a neighborhood skunk,

13:18.498 --> 13:20.498
and he would spray me,

13:20.500 --> 13:24.335
and I would spray him right back
with my garden mister.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.638
Well, the sprayings
lessened over time

13:26.640 --> 13:29.174
until one day we were both
sitting on the curb,

13:29.176 --> 13:32.110
looked into each others eyes,
and basically said,

13:32.112 --> 13:35.980
"Hey, we're not
so different, you and I."

13:35.982 --> 13:38.449
Ultimately we were, though.

13:38.451 --> 13:40.518
He had rabies and
I had to get a shot

13:40.520 --> 13:43.488
in my stomach for 60 months.

13:43.490 --> 13:46.191
But for a brief time
we were inseparable.

13:46.193 --> 13:47.492
ERICA:
Shouldn't we at least

13:47.494 --> 13:49.828
wait around, like,
a little bit longer?

13:49.830 --> 13:51.529
No, we shouldn't.

13:51.531 --> 13:53.031
What are you up to, Tandy?

13:53.033 --> 13:56.868
Don't worry. I know what to do
here, 'cause I know this guy.

13:56.870 --> 13:59.370
You haven't even met him,
so how can you know him?

13:59.372 --> 14:02.707
Because that little boy
or old man in a child body

14:02.709 --> 14:04.676
is me-- Carol, take the wheel.

14:04.678 --> 14:05.677
Come get me in the morning!
Tandy, no!

14:05.679 --> 14:08.046
(grunting and groaning)

14:08.048 --> 14:10.682
It's all part of the plan.

14:10.684 --> 14:13.451
(groans)
Worth it.

14:13.453 --> 14:14.686
TODD (imitating Gail):
<i>"Hey, don't do me any favors,</i>

14:14.688 --> 14:16.187
Todd."

14:16.189 --> 14:17.622
Oh, here's the stupid elevator.

14:23.996 --> 14:26.064
(elevator bell dings)

14:32.638 --> 14:35.707
Oh, my God.

14:43.816 --> 14:44.916
Aw, man.

15:02.868 --> 15:04.936
(sighs)

15:08.574 --> 15:10.575
Thank you.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.644
Yeah.

15:14.413 --> 15:16.748
Gail, I had no idea.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.182
How's that?

15:18.184 --> 15:20.318
What you went through in there.

15:21.787 --> 15:23.788
It's okay.

15:23.790 --> 15:28.259
No, I-I've been so focused on
Melissa, I've had blinders on.

15:28.261 --> 15:31.362
There's no way
you could've known, Todd.

15:31.364 --> 15:34.766
Still, I'm sorry.

15:34.768 --> 15:36.467
Thank you.

15:36.469 --> 15:38.536
I-I got you one more thing.

15:42.474 --> 15:43.708
(chuckles)

15:43.710 --> 15:45.610
Todd.

15:45.612 --> 15:48.479
I'm really happy
he was in there with you.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.848
I was, too.

15:54.653 --> 15:56.154
Thank you.

15:56.156 --> 15:59.524
Fine, you're welcome, hon.

16:00.492 --> 16:03.661
All right.
We got Gordon fixed up.

16:03.663 --> 16:06.331
Let's go see what we can do
about Melissa.

16:08.167 --> 16:10.668
Where the hell are you?

16:10.670 --> 16:12.170
I'm not here anymore.

16:12.172 --> 16:14.172
You saw me drive off.

16:14.174 --> 16:16.674
Why won't you go back in there?

16:16.676 --> 16:18.509
Ah, screw it.

16:18.511 --> 16:21.245
Okay! Hey, the jig is up!

16:21.247 --> 16:24.248
Yeah! I'm a person, not a bush!

16:24.250 --> 16:27.251
I'm sorry to have lied to you!

16:27.253 --> 16:30.021
And just know I'm not leaving
till you come back!

16:30.023 --> 16:32.523
You know? I mean, it'd be nice
if it was on the sooner side!

16:32.525 --> 16:34.325
It's getting pretty cold out.

16:34.327 --> 16:37.695
All I got on under this thing
is a Beefy-T.

16:37.697 --> 16:40.531
Anyway, I'm here!

16:42.601 --> 16:45.269
Still hanging in there!

16:45.271 --> 16:48.106
My nipples are like diamonds
at this point!

16:48.108 --> 16:51.376
Okay, well, ready whenever you
are for a little meet and greet!

16:51.378 --> 16:53.878
Looforwarto't!

16:53.880 --> 16:56.514
That's a shortening of the
phrase "looking forward to it"!

16:56.516 --> 16:57.982
Just made that up.

16:57.984 --> 17:00.118
It's gonna save me a lot of time
in the future.

17:00.120 --> 17:03.054
Okay! Well, I'll see you soon!

17:03.056 --> 17:06.324
Again, looforwarto't!

17:06.326 --> 17:08.559
Looforwarto't.

17:08.561 --> 17:10.328
Still here!

17:10.330 --> 17:14.132
Yeah, nature called,
and I am currently answering!

17:14.134 --> 17:17.135
Yeah, went a little hard
on the prune juice!

17:17.137 --> 17:19.137
That's something you'll learn
about me!

17:19.139 --> 17:20.738
Major prune guy!

17:20.740 --> 17:23.241
Anyway, I'm here for you
whenever!

17:23.243 --> 17:26.244
Uh, actually, you know what,
now might not be the best time!

17:26.246 --> 17:29.247
Might want to give it about two.
Yeah.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.749
(laughs)
No pun intended! Boom.

17:31.751 --> 17:33.718
Actually, better make it three!

17:33.720 --> 17:36.387
(chuckles)
Hey, looforwarto't!

17:36.389 --> 17:39.257
♪ Take one down,
pass it around ♪

17:39.259 --> 17:43.261
♪ 2,553 bottles
of Richard Gere on the wall ♪

17:43.263 --> 17:45.596
♪ Two thousand... ♪
Oh, God.

17:45.598 --> 17:47.098
Okay, look!

17:47.100 --> 17:49.033
Enough is enough!

17:49.035 --> 17:51.903
I don't know
why you won't come out here!

17:51.905 --> 17:55.840
Huh?! Is it 'cause of the whole
housecleaning thing?!

17:55.842 --> 17:58.376
'Cause I didn't do that!
That wasn't me!

17:58.378 --> 18:01.512
I would never do that to you!
I promise!

18:01.514 --> 18:05.616
See, not too long ago,
I was exactly like you!

18:05.618 --> 18:10.021
All alone,
living in a messy house!

18:10.023 --> 18:13.091
And then one day some woman--
the same woman, actually--

18:13.093 --> 18:16.260
you know, she came in
and tried to clean it all up!

18:16.262 --> 18:18.262
I hated it!

18:18.264 --> 18:21.099
But now that woman

18:21.101 --> 18:26.270
is the woman that makes me
looforwarto't each day!

18:26.272 --> 18:30.108
And that can happen for you
if you'd just give it a chance!

18:30.110 --> 18:31.309
(sighs)

18:31.311 --> 18:33.878
So what do you say?!

18:36.281 --> 18:38.349
(sighs)

18:43.455 --> 18:44.622
(door opens)

18:44.624 --> 18:46.224
Any luck?
(door closes)

18:46.226 --> 18:48.893
She just keeps talking
about Santa's penis.

18:48.895 --> 18:51.496
She's got a real hankering
for Santa's junk.

18:51.498 --> 18:52.563
Yeah.

18:52.565 --> 18:54.632
You find anything?
I mean,

18:54.634 --> 18:58.136
there's about a million drugs
in there.

18:58.138 --> 19:00.671
I just wish she'd give us
some kind of a clue, you know?

19:00.673 --> 19:01.672
Yeah.

19:01.674 --> 19:02.740
Yeah.

19:07.846 --> 19:09.180
Todd.

19:09.182 --> 19:11.182
Yeah.

19:11.184 --> 19:13.417
I think she did.

19:13.419 --> 19:15.253
What?

19:15.255 --> 19:17.255
Yeah.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.523
Clozapine.

19:18.525 --> 19:20.591
Claus-a-peen.

19:20.593 --> 19:22.994
Claus-o-peen.
Claus-o-peen.

19:22.996 --> 19:24.595
Claus-o-peen.
Claus-a-peen.
Claus-a-peen.

19:24.597 --> 19:27.498
Santa Claus' penis.
Santa Claus' penis!

19:27.500 --> 19:29.267
Santa Claus' penis. Can I
see that, please? Thank you.

19:29.269 --> 19:30.601
Oh!

19:30.603 --> 19:32.937
Uh, Gail, it's a match.
It's-it's a match.

19:32.939 --> 19:34.539
Uh, uh, here.
Yeah?

19:34.541 --> 19:37.542
"Antipsychotic medication
treating bipolar disorder,

19:37.544 --> 19:41.546
severe anxiety, some forms
of posttraumatic stress"!

19:41.548 --> 19:44.282
Santa's penis is clozapine.
Santa's penis is clozapine!

19:44.284 --> 19:46.551
BOTH:
Santa's penis is clozapine!
Santa's penis is clozapine!

19:46.553 --> 19:47.618
Oh!

20:02.568 --> 20:04.569
(chuckles)
That was fun.

20:04.571 --> 20:07.405
Did you see that?
I did a roll-out.
Yeah.

20:07.407 --> 20:08.739
(giggles)

20:08.741 --> 20:10.641
Tandy, are you okay?
Oh.

20:10.643 --> 20:12.076
No, I'm not okay.

20:12.078 --> 20:14.579
All right? I poured my heart out
to that little piece of crap,

20:14.581 --> 20:16.480
and he just stonewalled me.

20:16.482 --> 20:17.748
I mean, he knew
I was out here,

20:17.750 --> 20:19.517
freezing my upper body off,

20:19.519 --> 20:20.985
and he just let me suffer.

20:20.987 --> 20:23.054
Well, how do you
know he knew?

20:23.056 --> 20:25.389
Oh, he knew. He knew.

20:25.391 --> 20:26.757
Come on,
let's get out of here.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.859
Oh, no, wait. I want to give
the little guy something to eat.

20:28.861 --> 20:32.330
I made some teriyaki
Cheetos from scratch.

20:32.332 --> 20:35.066
Carol, that little fartknocker
doesn't deserve your cooking.

20:35.068 --> 20:36.634
I hope it's not too delicious.
