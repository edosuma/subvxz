WEBVTT

00:02.252 --> 00:04.254
TONIGHT ON <i>KITCHEN NIGHTMARES...</i>

00:04.254 --> 00:07.841
CHEF RAMSAY VISITS A GREEK
RESTAURANT IN QUEENS, NEW YORK.

00:07.841 --> 00:10.385
THIS EATERY HAS COMPLETELY
LOST ITS WAY.

00:10.385 --> 00:11.887
OH, MY GOD.

00:11.887 --> 00:12.971
AND THE HUSBAND-AND-WIFE TEAM

00:12.971 --> 00:15.015
ARE ON THE BRINK
OF DIVORCE.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.558
YOU POINT YOUR FINGER.

00:16.558 --> 00:17.559
WHOO, WHOO,
WHOO, WHOO.

00:17.559 --> 00:20.187
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
WHAT A MESS.

00:20.187 --> 00:23.649
MANNY, THE CHEF, WANTS TO BLAME
EVERYONE ELSE FOR THE PROBLEMS.

00:23.649 --> 00:25.901
YOU HAVE TO TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY.

00:25.901 --> 00:28.028
IT'S NOT MY FOOD.
IT'S CHRISTINA'S RECIPES.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.488
HIS WIFE, CHRISTINA,

00:29.488 --> 00:30.000
IS TOTALLY FED UP WITH HIM
AND THE RESTAURANT.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.532
IS TOTALLY FED UP WITH HIM
AND THE RESTAURANT.

00:32.532 --> 00:35.410
THIS PLACE DESTROYED OUR FAMILY.

00:35.410 --> 00:38.413
AND DAUGHTER EVELYN
IS CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE,

00:38.413 --> 00:39.998
AND IS TOTALLY
AT HER WIT'S END.

00:39.998 --> 00:42.417
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU DON'T GET IT, DADDY.

00:42.417 --> 00:44.127
I'M UP TO HERE AGAIN!

00:44.127 --> 00:45.712
CHEF RAMSAY IS IN

00:45.712 --> 00:47.589
FOR ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT
KITCHEN NIGHTMARES EVER...

00:47.589 --> 00:49.007
SMELL THAT!

00:49.007 --> 00:51.802
AS HE DISCOVERS
AN APPALLING STATE OF AFFAIRS.

00:51.802 --> 00:53.470
THAT IS DISGUSTING!

00:53.470 --> 00:57.057
CAN HE GET THIS COUPLE SOMEHOW
TO WORK TOGETHER ONCE AGAIN?

00:57.057 --> 00:59.643
I HAVE NO IDEA
THAT THESE THINGS EXISTED.

00:59.643 --> 01:00.000
GIVE ME ONE MORE EXCUSE, AND
I'M GONNA FLIP MY  LID.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.021
GIVE ME ONE MORE EXCUSE, AND
I'M GONNA FLIP MY  LID.

01:03.021 --> 01:06.191
OR IS THEIR
35-YEAR-OLD MARRIAGE

01:06.191 --> 01:08.110
AND THEIR RESTAURANT
TOO FAR GONE TO SAVE?

01:08.110 --> 01:10.946
LOCK THE  DOOR
AND CLOSE IT DOWN!

01:14.074 --> 01:15.325
<i>WHAT IS THAT?</i>

01:15.325 --> 01:17.286
YOU'RE SERVING ROTTEN FOOD!

01:17.286 --> 01:18.620
THEY'RE NOT CRAP,
AND THEY'RE DELICIOUS.

01:18.620 --> 01:20.956
THEN WAKE UP!
YOU WAKE UP!

01:20.956 --> 01:21.957
SHUT THE PLACE DOWN!

01:21.957 --> 01:23.458
<i>GET OUT OF HERE!</i>

01:23.458 --> 01:24.793
THAT IS AMAZING!

01:24.793 --> 01:27.170
THAT'S EMBARRASSING!
OH, GOD!

01:27.170 --> 01:28.547
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

01:33.218 --> 01:35.012
QUEENS, NEW YORK, IS ONE

01:35.012 --> 01:38.223
OF THE MOST CULTURALLY DIVERSE
COMMUNITIES IN AMERICA.

01:38.223 --> 01:40.183
IT IS HERE WHERE
YOU'LL FIND KATI ALLO,

01:40.183 --> 01:42.936
A GREEK RESTAURANT
OPENED IN 2000

01:42.936 --> 01:47.065
BY HUSBAND-AND-WIFE OWNERS
MANNY AND CHRISTINA.

01:47.065 --> 01:49.026
I WAS NEXT DOOR
HAVING A HAIRCUT.

01:49.026 --> 01:51.153
THEY TOLD ME
THE PLACE IS FOR SALE.

01:51.153 --> 01:52.738
I KNOW ABOUT GREEK FOOD.

01:52.738 --> 01:54.990
I THOUGHT IT'S EASY TO RUN IT.

01:54.990 --> 01:57.409
SO I DECIDED TO BUY IT.

01:57.409 --> 01:59.119
KATI ALLO.
GOOD EVENING.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.000
MANNY WAS CRAZY TO BUY
THIS RESTAURANT.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.455
MANNY WAS CRAZY TO BUY
THIS RESTAURANT.

02:01.455 --> 02:03.999
THE PASTITSIO IS HERE,
AND THE FRIED CALAMARI IS HERE.

02:03.999 --> 02:07.669
I NEVER THOUGHT, NOT EVEN
IN MY WILDEST NIGHTMARES...

02:07.669 --> 02:09.880
GOOD NIGHT, LADIES.
THANK YOU.

02:09.880 --> 02:13.759
THAT I WOULD BE STUCK HERE
FOR 13 YEARS.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.888
I HAD GOOD TIMES
WHEN MY KIDS WERE HERE.

02:17.888 --> 02:19.348
DO WE HAVE TAKEOUT?
WE DO HAVE TAKEOUT.

02:19.348 --> 02:20.807
WE WERE MAKING MONEY.

02:20.807 --> 02:22.809
WE WERE HAPPY.
EVERYTHING WAS WORKING FINE.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.936
TABLE ONE. TAKE THIS.
GIVE ME THIS.

02:24.936 --> 02:27.481
AFTER MY KIDS
LEFT THE BUSINESS,

02:27.481 --> 02:29.191
ME AND MY WIFE--
WE STARTED FIGHTING.

02:29.191 --> 02:30.000
<i>CHRISTINA,</i>
<i>YOU JUST LOOK AT THEM,</i>

02:30.000 --> 02:30.859
<i>CHRISTINA,</i>
<i>YOU JUST LOOK AT THEM,</i>

02:30.859 --> 02:32.903
YOU THINK YOU GET
THE ORDER?

02:32.903 --> 02:34.780
AND IT GETS WORSE
AND WORSE AND WORSE.

02:34.780 --> 02:36.073
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

02:36.073 --> 02:37.991
<i>NEXT TIME DON'T PICK UP</i>
<i>ORDERS, CHRISTINA.</i>

02:37.991 --> 02:40.619
I BELIEVE THAT IT IS
MANNY'S FAULT

02:40.619 --> 02:42.746
THAT THE PLACE
IS FALLING APART.

02:42.746 --> 02:43.955
COME ON! COME ON!

02:43.955 --> 02:46.416
<i>WHO CARES?</i>
HUH?

02:46.416 --> 02:48.460
THE CUSTOMERS--
THEY'RE NOT COMING BACK

02:48.460 --> 02:50.671
BECAUSE THEY'RE TIRED TO LISTEN
TO THE SAME  EVERY DAY.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.881
YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING--
ONLY TALK, TALK, TALK.

02:55.884 --> 02:57.302
HE DOESN'T HAVE A SCHEDULE.

02:57.302 --> 02:59.179
CHRISTINA HAS TO TAKE
A STEP BACK.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.000
MANNY DOESN'T DISCUSS
ANYTHING WITH ME.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.015
MANNY DOESN'T DISCUSS
ANYTHING WITH ME.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.308
SHE'S PUSHING ME OUT OF WORK

03:03.308 --> 03:04.935
WITH HER NAGGING
AND WITH HER ATTITUDE.

03:04.935 --> 03:07.312
I'M NOT CHEAP.
I'M NOT STINGY.

03:07.312 --> 03:08.772
SHE'S STINGY.

03:08.772 --> 03:10.857
WHEN HE CALLS MY NAME,
IT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING NEGATIVE.

03:10.857 --> 03:15.070
"CHRISTINA! CHRISTINA!
I'M TALKING TO YOU!"

03:15.070 --> 03:18.281
BECAUSE I'M POPULAR,
SHE FEELS JEALOUS.

03:18.281 --> 03:19.825
MR. WONDERFUL--

03:19.825 --> 03:21.660
HE GETS AWAY WITH EVERYTHING.

03:21.660 --> 03:23.662
I THINK I'M GOOD
FOR THIS BUSINESS.

03:23.662 --> 03:26.873
AND CHRISTINA--
SHE BRINGS ME DOWN.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.875
MANNY BELIEVES
THAT HE IS GOD,

03:28.875 --> 03:30.000
THAT HE MAKES NO MISTAKES,
HE IS PERFECT.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.380
THAT HE MAKES NO MISTAKES,
HE IS PERFECT.

03:33.380 --> 03:36.758
AND HE DOES GET AWAY
WITH MURDER.

03:36.758 --> 03:39.886
CHRISTINA
IS EXAGGERATING A LOT.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.930
THEY'RE NOT
READY YET.
OKAY, I GOT YOU.
I HEARD YOU 30 TIMES.

03:41.930 --> 03:44.057
WHEN YOUR PARENTS ARE YELLING
AT EACH OTHER...

03:44.057 --> 03:45.517
CHRISTINA!
YES?

03:45.517 --> 03:47.060
THE GRILLED CALAMARI, PLEASE.
COME ON! COME ON!

03:47.060 --> 03:49.938
AND THERE'S CUSTOMERS
EVERYWHERE...

03:49.938 --> 03:51.314
NO. I CANNOT DO
EVERYTHING.

03:51.314 --> 03:53.900
THERE'S NOTHING OVER HERE.
DON'T LOOK AT IT.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.193
IT'S EMBARRASSING
FOR ME TO SEE THAT.

03:55.193 --> 03:57.028
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN.

03:57.028 --> 03:59.114
I THROW MY HANDS UP IN THE AIR,
AND I SAY, "THAT'S IT.

03:59.114 --> 04:00.000
I'M OUT.
I CAN'T DO THIS."

04:00.000 --> 04:00.323
I'M OUT.
I CAN'T DO THIS."

04:00.323 --> 04:02.576
YOU'RE YELLING AGAIN.

04:02.576 --> 04:03.785
WHO?
<i>EVERYONE.</i>

04:07.622 --> 04:10.375
WE CAME TO A POINT

04:10.375 --> 04:13.753
THAT THIS RESTAURANT
DROVE US SO CRAZY

04:13.753 --> 04:16.715
THAT CHRISTINA WENT
FOR A DIVORCE PAPER.

04:16.715 --> 04:18.008
I'M TIRED, YOU KNOW,

04:18.008 --> 04:20.552
FIGHTING OVER THE SAME
OVER AND OVER AND OVER.

04:20.552 --> 04:22.387
<i>I'M GETTING OUT.</i>

04:22.387 --> 04:26.057
I CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS.
THIS IS THE END.

04:26.057 --> 04:29.895
I'M NOT THINKING
ABOUT A DIVORCE RIGHT NOW

04:29.895 --> 04:30.000
BECAUSE MY PRIORITY
IS HOW TO FIX THIS RESTAURANT.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.441
BECAUSE MY PRIORITY
IS HOW TO FIX THIS RESTAURANT.

04:34.441 --> 04:38.987
CHEF RAMSAY, I THINK,
IS LIKE GOD'S GIFT.

04:38.987 --> 04:41.448
IT'S LIKE AN ANGEL.

04:41.448 --> 04:42.699
MAYBE HE'S THE ONLY PERSON

04:42.699 --> 04:45.869
THAT HE'S GOING TO PUT
MY HUSBAND IN HIS PLACE.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.710
<i>I LOVE GREEK FOOD.</i>

04:53.710 --> 04:55.670
HELLO.

04:55.670 --> 04:57.047
OH.

04:57.047 --> 04:58.590
HOW ARE YOU?
HOW YOU DOING?

04:58.590 --> 05:00.000
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
YOUR FIRST NAME IS?
MY NAME IS MANNY.

05:00.000 --> 05:00.592
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
YOUR FIRST NAME IS?
MY NAME IS MANNY.

05:00.592 --> 05:01.676
<i>MANNY. GOOD TO SEE YOU.</i>

05:01.676 --> 05:04.471
WELCOME TO KATI ALLO.
THANK YOU, MY DARLING.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.473
VERY HAPPY
TO MEET YOU.
AND FIRST NAME IS?

05:06.473 --> 05:08.016
CHRISTINA.
CHRISTINA.

05:08.016 --> 05:09.893
AND YOU ARE THE HEAD CHEF?
RIGHT.

05:09.893 --> 05:11.353
AND YOU'RE THE OWNER?
YES.

05:11.353 --> 05:13.355
WE'RE BOTH THE OWNER.
OH, YOU'RE BOTH THE OWNERS.

05:13.355 --> 05:15.148
<i>WE ARE HUSBAND AND WIFE.</i>

05:15.148 --> 05:16.817
LET'S CATCH UP FIRST,
SHALL WE?

05:16.817 --> 05:19.319
THE RESTAURANT,
WHICH IS FAILING--

05:19.319 --> 05:21.446
I SAY THAT'S
CHRISTINA'S FAULT.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.490
TAKE A SEAT, PLEASE.

05:23.490 --> 05:26.076
IF YOU ASK CHRISTINA,
I'M SURE SHE'S GONNA TELL YOU

05:26.076 --> 05:27.077
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

05:27.077 --> 05:29.204
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN MARRIED?

05:29.204 --> 05:30.000
35 YEARS.

05:30.000 --> 05:30.288
35 YEARS.

05:30.288 --> 05:33.291
35 YEARS?
A LONG TIME
WITH ONE MAN.

05:37.337 --> 05:40.340
HOW DID WE FIND OURSELVES HERE?
WHO'S IDEA WAS THIS?

05:40.340 --> 05:41.967
ONE DAY HE CAME HOME,
AND HE SAID,

05:41.967 --> 05:46.763
"WELL, I'M GOING TO BECOME
PARTNER IN A RESTAURANT.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.390
I SAID,
"WHAT IS GOING ON?"

05:48.390 --> 05:51.518
TWO DOORS NEXT
FROM MY DOOR WAS A...

05:51.518 --> 05:53.270
A BEAUTY SALON.

05:53.270 --> 05:56.064
<i>SO I WAS HAVING A HAIRCUT,</i>
<i>AND THAT'S HOW I CAME HERE.</i>

05:56.064 --> 05:58.483
I TALKED TO THE MAN
THAT I KNEW.

05:58.483 --> 05:59.693
YOU'RE HAVING YOUR HAIR CUT.

05:59.693 --> 06:00.000
YES.

06:00.000 --> 06:00.694
YES.

06:00.694 --> 06:01.778
NEXT DOOR.
YES.

06:01.778 --> 06:03.238
AND THROUGHOUT THIS HAIRCUT,

06:03.238 --> 06:05.365
YOU DECIDE TO BUY THE RESTAURANT
TWO DOORS DOWN.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.491
YES.

06:06.491 --> 06:07.701
JUST LIKE THAT?

06:07.701 --> 06:08.702
JUST LIKE THAT.

06:08.702 --> 06:09.661
WERE YOU RUNNING
A RESTAURANT BEFORE?

06:09.661 --> 06:10.662
NO.

06:10.662 --> 06:13.540
YOU'VE BEEN OPEN
HOW LONG?

06:13.540 --> 06:15.333
SO HE COMES BACK,
"HONEY, I'VE JUST HAD A HAIRCUT,

06:15.333 --> 06:16.793
I BOUGHT MYSELF A RESTAURANT."
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

06:16.793 --> 06:20.297
I SAID,
"THAT'S JUST CRAZY."

06:20.297 --> 06:21.673
14 YEARS AGO
YOU DIDN'T WANT IT?

06:21.673 --> 06:23.717
NO, I DIDN'T WANT A BUSINESS
BECAUSE I HAD NO IDEA

06:23.717 --> 06:25.135
HOW TO RUN
A RESTAURANT.

06:25.135 --> 06:27.679
AND DID YOU KNOW THAT YOUR WIFE
DIDN'T WANT IT?

06:27.679 --> 06:28.680
YES.

06:28.680 --> 06:30.000
YOU DID?
YES.

06:30.000 --> 06:30.056
YOU DID?
YES.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.934
BUT YOU STILL WENT AHEAD
AND DID IT ANYHOW?
YES.

06:32.934 --> 06:35.312
THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE IDEA--
MY WIFE AND MY KIDS.

06:35.312 --> 06:38.481
I TOLD HIM, "DO YOU KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT A RESTAURANT?"

06:38.481 --> 06:41.276
NO. BUT I CAME HERE,
AND SINCE THEN, I'M STUCK.

06:41.276 --> 06:42.694
STUCK.
HAS IT BEEN THAT BAD?

06:48.658 --> 06:51.161
NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
SHE'S EXAGGERATING.

06:51.161 --> 06:52.871
<i>I TELL YOU</i>
<i>WHAT HAPPENED.</i>

06:52.871 --> 06:54.456
WE WERE VERY,
VERY SUCCESSFUL.

06:54.456 --> 06:55.624
<i>OUR KIDS,</i>

06:55.624 --> 06:57.125
THEY WERE
MAKING THIS BUSINESS...

06:57.125 --> 06:58.335
YOUR CHILDREN?
<i>VERY SUCCESSFUL.</i>

06:58.335 --> 06:59.711
YES.

06:59.711 --> 07:00.000
<i>AND THE KIDS WORKED</i>
<i>IN THIS BUSINESS?</i>
YES.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.379
<i>AND THE KIDS WORKED</i>
<i>IN THIS BUSINESS?</i>
YES.

07:01.379 --> 07:02.714
SO THEY'RE
STILL INVOLVED?

07:02.714 --> 07:06.301
ONLY MY DAUGHTER.
YES.

07:06.301 --> 07:09.721
AND TELL ME WHEN IT
STARTED DISAPPEARING.

07:13.725 --> 07:16.353
BUT ACTUALLY,
THE LAST YEAR IS VERY BAD.

07:21.691 --> 07:23.443
THE FIGHTS BETWEEN US.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.528
THE FIGHTS?

07:28.281 --> 07:30.000
HOW LONG HAVE YOU TWO BEEN
AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS?

07:30.000 --> 07:30.784
HOW LONG HAVE YOU TWO BEEN
AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS?

07:33.662 --> 07:35.664
EVERY DAY,
EVERY DAY.

07:35.664 --> 07:39.042
WHAT DO YOU
FIGHT ABOUT?

07:47.634 --> 07:49.594
NO, I WAS HERE.

07:49.594 --> 07:53.807
NO, HE WASN'T HERE, YOU KNOW,
LONG HOURS LIKE ME, NEVER.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.100
WHO'S IN CHARGE?

07:55.100 --> 07:58.061
SHE'S IN CHARGE,
AND I DON'T LIKE THAT.

07:58.061 --> 07:59.646
I DO EVERYTHING,
BUT HE'S THE BOSS.

07:59.646 --> 08:00.000
HE DOESN'T CARE.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.898
HE DOESN'T CARE.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.608
- IT'S NOT TRUE?
<i>- IT'S NOT TRUE.</i>

08:03.608 --> 08:05.568
<i>I NEVER CUT CORNERS.</i>
LET ME FINISH, PLEASE.

08:05.568 --> 08:07.404
I NEVER KEEP
ANYTHING SECRET.
LET ME FINISH!

08:07.404 --> 08:09.614
LET ME FINISH,
CHRISTINA.
<i>EVERYTHING IS OPEN.</i>

08:09.614 --> 08:12.617
EVERY DAY I TELL HIM,
"LISTEN, HERE IT IS."

08:12.617 --> 08:14.911
<i>CHRISTINA.</i>

08:14.911 --> 08:17.205
<i>CHRISTINA, CAN I TALK?</i>
<i>LET ME FINISH!</i>

08:17.205 --> 08:18.415
<i>YOU TALK TO ME,</i>
<i>AND YOU POINT,</i>

08:18.415 --> 08:21.209
YOU KNOW, YOUR FINGER,
AND YOU DO ALL THIS STUFF

08:21.209 --> 08:23.503
<i>IN FRONT OF MY CUSTOMERS.</i>

08:23.503 --> 08:25.672
HE COMES IN FRONT, AND HE WILL
WHOO, WHOO, WHOO, WHOO!

08:25.672 --> 08:26.548
HE GIVES, YOU KNOW,
INSTRUCTIONS.

08:26.548 --> 08:28.550
- TO YOU?
<i>- TO ME.</i>

08:28.550 --> 08:29.884
<i>AND I TRY--</i>
SO WHAT DO YOU--

08:29.884 --> 08:30.000
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO SAY NOW?

08:30.000 --> 08:33.513
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO SAY NOW?

08:33.513 --> 08:35.765
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO SAY NOW?

08:35.765 --> 08:37.642
<i>ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY</i>
<i>THAT I'M NOT GOOD FOR THIS?</i>

08:37.642 --> 08:39.602
I CAN GO OUT,
AND THIS IS IT.

08:39.602 --> 08:42.814
I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH.
YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH.

08:42.814 --> 08:44.399
<i>THAT'S WHAT IT IS.</i>

08:47.819 --> 08:49.404
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"HOW ABOUT"?

08:49.404 --> 08:50.447
<i>I DON'T WANT TO BE</i>
<i>IN CHARGE.</i>

08:50.447 --> 08:52.657
<i>I'M ASKING YOU.</i>

08:52.657 --> 08:54.367
<i>I WANT TO WORK, AND I WANT</i>
<i>TO REACH A POINT--</i>

08:54.367 --> 08:55.952
YEAH, BUT YOU HAVE
TO CHANGE.

08:55.952 --> 08:57.620
LISTENING TO YOU BOTH
FOR THE LAST FIVE MINUTES,

08:57.620 --> 08:58.955
I GOT NO IDEA
WHO'S RIGHT, WHO'S WRONG,

08:58.955 --> 09:00.000
BUT HOW DO YOU
SURVIVE THIS?

09:00.000 --> 09:00.582
BUT HOW DO YOU
SURVIVE THIS?

09:00.582 --> 09:03.960
I DON'T KNOW.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.462
DOES THIS GO ON
AT HOME?

09:05.462 --> 09:06.755
WELL, IF YOU HAVE
PROBLEMS HERE,

09:06.755 --> 09:09.507
YOU THINK YOU'RE
NOT GONNA TAKE IT HOME?

09:09.507 --> 09:10.884
<i>WHAT'S THIS DONE</i>
<i>TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP?</i>

09:10.884 --> 09:12.510
I MEAN--
IT HAS DESTROYED.

09:12.510 --> 09:14.429
THERE IS NO RELATIONSHIP.

09:14.429 --> 09:16.806
<i>A LAWYER CALLED ME,</i>
<i>AND HE SAYS,</i>

09:16.806 --> 09:20.643
"CHRISTINA IS HERE.
SHE'S FILING FOR A DIVORCE."

09:20.643 --> 09:23.396
SO YOU GOT DIVORCED?
NO, NO, NO, WE'RE NOT.

09:23.396 --> 09:27.525
WE NEVER--
SO YOU DIDN'T SIGN
THE DOCUMENT?

09:27.525 --> 09:28.526
DID YOU SIGN IT?

09:28.526 --> 09:30.000
<i>DID YOU SIGN IT?</i>
NO.

09:30.000 --> 09:30.403
<i>DID YOU SIGN IT?</i>
NO.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.821
THIS IS CRAZY.

09:31.821 --> 09:34.199
- WHAT A MESS.
- YEAH, BIG MESS.

09:34.199 --> 09:36.576
IT IS A MESS.
IT'S A BIG MESS.

09:38.036 --> 09:40.163
AND WE SLEEP IN DIFFERENT
BEDS SOMETIMES.

09:40.163 --> 09:41.456
YOU HAVE DIFFERENT
BEDROOMS AT HOME?

09:41.456 --> 09:43.166
<i>OF COURSE.</i>
<i>WHY NOT?</i>

09:43.166 --> 09:44.834
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
LIVED THERE?

09:44.834 --> 09:46.377
ALMOST 20 YEARS.

09:46.377 --> 09:47.712
IS IT ALL PAID OFF?

09:47.712 --> 09:49.672
WE'RE SELLING THIS HOUSE
TO SAVE THIS BUSINESS

09:49.672 --> 09:51.800
AND TO SAVE OURSELVES
FROM THE BANKRUPTCIES.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.426
- WHAT?
<i>- YES.</i>

09:53.426 --> 09:55.011
<i>YOU'RE SELLING--</i>
WE SOLD IT ALREADY.

09:55.011 --> 09:58.139
YOU SOLD THE HOUSE?

09:58.139 --> 10:00.000
YOU SOLD THE HOUSE TO PUT MONEY
INTO THE BUSINESS?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.476
YOU SOLD THE HOUSE TO PUT MONEY
INTO THE BUSINESS?

10:01.476 --> 10:05.480
IT WAS HIS IDEA.

10:05.480 --> 10:08.149
I LOVE THE HOUSE
BECAUSE I BUILT THIS--

10:08.149 --> 10:12.445
MY HOUSE THE SAME WAY
THAT I BUILT THIS PLACE HERE.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.874
SINCE WE CAME HERE...

10:24.874 --> 10:27.794
I'M NOWHERE.
I HAVE NO LIFE.

10:30.213 --> 10:32.340
YOU KNOW?

10:32.340 --> 10:35.426
THIS PLACE DESTROYED
OUR FAMILY.

10:42.766 --> 10:45.685
AFTER DISCOVERING THAT MANNY
AND CHRISTINA'S MARRIAGE

10:45.685 --> 10:47.061
IS ON THE VERGE OF DIVORCE,

10:47.061 --> 10:49.856
CHEF RAMSAY WANTS TO QUICKLY GET
A TASTE OF THE MENU

10:49.856 --> 10:51.566
AND GET A HANDLE
ON THE QUALITY OF THE FOOD

10:51.566 --> 10:54.235
THAT IS BEING SERVED
AT KATI ALLO.

10:54.235 --> 10:55.278
HELLO.
HOW ARE YOU?

10:55.278 --> 10:56.613
WELCOME TO KATI ALLO.

10:56.613 --> 10:57.781
NICE TO SEE YOU.

10:57.781 --> 10:59.657
THIS IS THE DRINKS.
THE DRINKS?

10:59.657 --> 11:00.658
AND THIS IS THE MENU.

11:00.658 --> 11:02.577
AND WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
IRENE.

11:02.577 --> 11:04.704
<i>HOW LONG YOU BEEN HERE?</i>

11:04.704 --> 11:06.790
I'M HERE SINCE 2000.
OH, WOW.

11:06.790 --> 11:07.791
SO YOU'VE
BEEN HERE SINCE--
<i>A LONG TIME.</i>

11:07.791 --> 11:08.750
<i>WOW.</i>

11:08.750 --> 11:09.097
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH THE PLACE?

11:09.097 --> 11:11.211
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH THE PLACE?

11:11.211 --> 11:13.129
WELL, THE TWO BOSSES,
IF YOU HAVE TWO BOSSES,

11:13.129 --> 11:14.756
THEY HAVE
DIFFERENT OPINION AND...

11:14.756 --> 11:16.007
BUT WHO'S RIGHT?

11:16.007 --> 11:18.885
BECAUSE THEY DON'T EVEN
SOUND LIKE HUSBAND AND WIFE.

11:18.885 --> 11:21.429
YOU TRY TO DO THINGS
THE WAY ONE SAY,

11:21.429 --> 11:23.515
AND THEN THE OTHER ONE
SAY DIFFERENT THINGS.

11:23.515 --> 11:26.351
AND YOU DON'T DO IT, ONE OF THEM
SCREAMING, "WHY YOU DO IT?"

11:26.351 --> 11:27.811
BECAUSE SHE SAY OR HE SAY.

11:27.811 --> 11:31.439
<i>AND IT'S GETTING WORSE</i>
<i>AND WORSE EVERY DAY, I THINK.</i>

11:31.439 --> 11:33.608
WOW.

11:33.608 --> 11:35.068
SHALL I ORDER?
OF COURSE.

11:35.068 --> 11:38.571
OKAY, LET'S START
WITH THE PASTITSIO.

11:38.571 --> 11:39.097
WHAT ELSE?

11:39.097 --> 11:39.656
WHAT ELSE?

11:39.656 --> 11:41.032
OH, THE GREEK-STYLE PORK.

11:41.032 --> 11:42.659
<i>LOUKANIKO?</i>

11:42.659 --> 11:43.993
<i>THE CLASSIC ONE.</i>
OKAY.

11:43.993 --> 11:46.329
AND THEN A GYRO PLATTER
AS WELL, PLEASE.

11:46.329 --> 11:48.039
<i>AND I THINK THAT IS IT.</i>

11:48.039 --> 11:49.958
THANK YOU, IRENE.

11:49.958 --> 11:51.167
LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

11:51.167 --> 11:52.710
<i>GOD, IT'S DEPRESSING.</i>

11:52.710 --> 11:57.215
THE COLORS IN HERE
ARE DREADFUL.

11:57.215 --> 11:59.050
UGH! HORRIBLE.

12:01.219 --> 12:05.181
ONE PASTITSIO, ONE GYRO PLATE
WITH LEMON POTATOES.

12:05.181 --> 12:06.558
<i>GYRO SANDWICH, PLEASE.</i>

12:06.558 --> 12:09.097
YES, IT'S COMING
RIGHT NOW.

12:09.097 --> 12:10.520
YES, IT'S COMING
RIGHT NOW.

12:11.813 --> 12:12.856
OH, THE GYRO.

12:12.856 --> 12:14.983
THIS IS THE GYRO
WITH THE LEMON POTATOES.

12:14.983 --> 12:16.609
IS IT FRESH?

12:16.609 --> 12:18.528
THAT'S COMING FROZEN,
THAT GYRO.

12:18.528 --> 12:20.238
WOW.

12:20.238 --> 12:22.907
THEY DON'T MAKE IT HERE.

12:24.951 --> 12:26.828
<i>WOW.</i>

12:26.828 --> 12:28.580
<i>THAT GYRO'S TERRIBLE.</i>

12:28.580 --> 12:30.290
WHY WOULD YOU SERVE
FROZEN GYRO HERE?

12:30.290 --> 12:33.042
THAT'S THE STYLE
HE MAKE IT HERE.

12:33.042 --> 12:35.003
THAT'S NOT THE WAY
TO COOK IT.

12:35.003 --> 12:37.422
DOES ANYONE EVER COMPLAIN
ABOUT THIS?
YES.

12:37.422 --> 12:39.097
DO YOU HONESTLY THINK
THAT IS GOOD?

12:39.097 --> 12:40.466
DO YOU HONESTLY THINK
THAT IS GOOD?

12:40.466 --> 12:43.219
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

12:43.219 --> 12:45.555
WOW.

12:45.555 --> 12:49.475
THIS IS EMBARRASSING.

12:49.475 --> 12:51.644
IF THERE'S ONE THING
THAT YOU SHOULD NAIL,

12:51.644 --> 12:55.440
A GYRO--THAT'S THE HALLMARK
OF ANY GOOD GREEK RESTAURANT.

12:55.440 --> 12:56.941
MANO?
YES?

12:56.941 --> 12:59.152
THIS ONE--HE TRIED THIS,
DOESN'T LIKE IT.

12:59.152 --> 13:01.362
WHO SAID THAT?

13:01.362 --> 13:02.405
MISTER...

13:02.405 --> 13:04.365
MR. RAMSAY?
RAMSAY.

13:04.365 --> 13:06.492
WOW.
THAT WAS A BAD START.

13:06.492 --> 13:09.097
LOUKANIKO APPETIZER.

13:09.097 --> 13:09.662
LOUKANIKO APPETIZER.

13:09.662 --> 13:11.581
OKAY, PUT IT
IN A NICE PLATE.

13:11.581 --> 13:13.583
<i>YOU GOT TO MAKE IT NICE.</i>
<i>THIS IS FOR CHEF RAMSAY.</i>

13:15.543 --> 13:17.629
THANK YOU.

13:19.631 --> 13:22.133
OKAY, THIS IS
THE TRADITIONAL LOUKANIKO.

13:22.133 --> 13:23.927
- THE GREEK SAUSAGE.
<i>- THE SAUSAGE.</i>

13:23.927 --> 13:24.969
<i>LOOK AT THAT.</i>

13:24.969 --> 13:26.721
ARE THEY--
IS THAT DEEP FRIED?

13:26.721 --> 13:31.017
THEY FRY IT,
AND THEY SAUTEE WITH WINE.

13:31.017 --> 13:32.435
<i>IT'S BLAND.</i>

13:32.435 --> 13:36.481
WHEN YOU FRY SAUSAGE LIKE THAT,
THE FLAVOR'S GONE.

13:36.481 --> 13:38.524
IT LOOKS LIKE
THE REMAINDER OF A DOG CHEW.

13:38.524 --> 13:39.097
THAT IS A MESS.

13:39.097 --> 13:39.817
THAT IS A MESS.

13:39.817 --> 13:42.737
PHEW.
IT JUST SMELLS OF FRYER.

13:42.737 --> 13:44.864
WHERE'S THE WHITE WINE
AND GARLIC?

13:44.864 --> 13:46.324
TOO MUCH GREASE.

13:46.324 --> 13:48.534
I MEAN,
THAT'S JUST GREASE.

13:48.534 --> 13:49.911
<i>THERE'S MORE GREASE</i>
<i>IN THIS PLATE</i>

13:49.911 --> 13:51.579
THAN THERE IS
IN THE GREEK ISLES.

13:51.579 --> 13:54.582
<i>I'M SO SORRY.</i>
<i>I KNOW.</i>

13:54.582 --> 13:55.958
JUST TASTE THAT.

13:55.958 --> 13:58.795
PLEASE.

13:58.795 --> 14:00.296
DOES THAT REMIND YOU
OF GREECE?

14:00.296 --> 14:03.132
ONLY I TASTE GARLIC
AND GREASE.

14:03.132 --> 14:05.510
<i>THIS AREA OF QUEENS</i>
<i>IS CALLED FLUSHING.</i>

14:05.510 --> 14:08.513
<i>RIGHT NOW I'D LIKE TO FLUSH</i>
<i>THESE RIGHT DOWN THE TOILET.</i>

14:08.513 --> 14:09.097
EXCUSE ME.

14:09.097 --> 14:11.557
EXCUSE ME.

14:11.557 --> 14:13.601
A LOT OF GARLIC
THERE, HUH?

14:13.601 --> 14:14.686
OH,.

14:19.315 --> 14:22.151
OH,.
YOU'RE--

14:23.820 --> 14:26.781
TAKE SOME WATER,
DARLING.

14:26.781 --> 14:28.116
YOU OKAY, IRENE?

14:28.116 --> 14:29.283
I'M OKAY.

14:29.283 --> 14:32.078
I'M OKAY.

14:33.413 --> 14:36.624
HEY, MANO, THE LOUKANIKO
WAS TOO GREASY.

14:36.624 --> 14:39.097
IT DOESN'T HAVE
ANY WINE SAUCE ON THE BOTTOM.

14:39.097 --> 14:39.377
IT DOESN'T HAVE
ANY WINE SAUCE ON THE BOTTOM.

14:39.377 --> 14:41.754
IT WAS JUST PLAIN GREASY,
SO HE CAN'T EAT IT.

14:41.754 --> 14:44.006
I DON'T THINK IT'S GREASY.

14:44.006 --> 14:45.591
IT'S ONE OF THE BEST LOUKANIKO

14:45.591 --> 14:47.427
THAT WE HAVE
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

14:47.427 --> 14:48.928
I DON'T KNOW
WHY HE DOESN'T LIKE IT.

14:53.725 --> 14:56.352
LET'S MAKE IT GOOD THIS TIME.

14:56.352 --> 14:59.397
IRENE, CAN WE GET
THIS STUFF TO CHEF?

15:02.066 --> 15:05.528
OKAY, THIS IS
THE PASTITSIO.

15:05.528 --> 15:07.989
THANK YOU, DARLING.

15:10.032 --> 15:12.952
WOW.
THIS IS DREADFUL.

15:12.952 --> 15:17.373
IT'S LIKE A BLAND
PILE OF WORMS.

15:17.373 --> 15:18.458
IT'S BLAND.

15:18.458 --> 15:21.043
<i>I MEAN,</i>
<i>THAT IS DEPRESSING.</i>

15:21.043 --> 15:22.712
WHEN SOMETHING
STARTS STEAMING

15:22.712 --> 15:25.006
THAT HOT LIKE THAT
IN THE CENTER,

15:25.006 --> 15:26.674
IT CONFIRMS
IT'S BEEN MICROWAVED.

15:26.674 --> 15:31.262
AND AS FOR THAT CONCOCTION,
OH, MY GOD!

15:31.262 --> 15:33.514
IT LOOKS LIKE
THE INTESTINES OF A COW.

15:33.514 --> 15:34.557
THAT IS A MESS.

15:34.557 --> 15:36.434
POPULAR?

15:36.434 --> 15:37.727
EH.

15:37.727 --> 15:39.097
THAT MEANS NO.

15:39.097 --> 15:39.437
THAT MEANS NO.

15:39.437 --> 15:40.730
WOW.

15:40.730 --> 15:42.398
ARE WE DONE?
I'M SO SORRY. YES.

15:42.398 --> 15:43.608
DO WE HAVE
ANYTHING ELSE COMING?

15:43.608 --> 15:45.318
NO. DO YOU WANT TO LOOK
FOR SOMETHING ELSE?

15:45.318 --> 15:47.445
THE BATHROOM--THAT'S WHAT
I'D LIKE TO LOOK FOR.

15:47.445 --> 15:50.615
I'M SORRY.

15:50.615 --> 15:53.242
OH, MY GOD.

15:56.579 --> 15:58.539
<i>MANO?</i>
YES?

16:03.211 --> 16:05.213
COME ON! SEE?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT?

16:05.213 --> 16:07.632
ALL SHOUTING OVER THERE.

16:07.632 --> 16:09.097
OKAY.
PLEASE.

16:09.097 --> 16:09.383
OKAY.
PLEASE.

16:09.383 --> 16:11.636
IRENE? IRENE?

16:13.721 --> 16:16.265
- IRENE?
- HELL.

16:19.727 --> 16:23.356
I'M EXTREMELY UPSET WITH MANNY

16:23.356 --> 16:27.235
BECAUSE HE SHOULD CHECK
EVERY DISH BEFORE IT GOES OUT,

16:27.235 --> 16:30.822
AND ESPECIALLY TODAY
THAT WE HAVE CHEF RAMSAY HERE.

16:30.822 --> 16:34.283
WOW.

16:34.283 --> 16:37.495
YEAH, I'M LOST FOR WORDS.

16:37.495 --> 16:39.097
EVERYTHING WAS GREASY.

16:39.097 --> 16:39.580
EVERYTHING WAS GREASY.

16:39.580 --> 16:41.916
<i>I CAN'T SEE</i>
<i>ANY FRESHNESS HERE.</i>

16:41.916 --> 16:43.668
DID YOU ACTUALLY COOK
MY LUNCH?

16:43.668 --> 16:45.127
<i>DID YOU DO ANYTHING?</i>

16:45.127 --> 16:46.128
I DID YOUR GYRO.
I DID--

16:46.128 --> 16:49.173
THE FROZEN GYRO?
THAT GYRO IS PROCESSED.

16:49.173 --> 16:50.675
<i>IT TASTED JUST BLAND,</i>

16:50.675 --> 16:53.302
JUST HORRIBLE.

16:53.302 --> 16:54.804
<i>GREEK SAUSAGE--</i>

16:54.804 --> 16:57.265
NO WHITE WINE, NO RED WINE,
NO SHALLOT, NO GARLIC, NOTHING--

16:57.265 --> 16:58.766
JUST A GREASY MESS.

16:58.766 --> 17:02.812
YOU NEARLY CHOKED ON IT, IRENE.
IT WAS THAT GREASY.

17:02.812 --> 17:04.105
IT WAS PUT IN THE FRYER?

17:04.105 --> 17:05.106
YES.

17:05.106 --> 17:06.566
WHO'S IDEA WAS THAT?

17:06.566 --> 17:09.097
THIS IS AN OLD RECIPE.

17:09.097 --> 17:09.235
THIS IS AN OLD RECIPE.

17:09.235 --> 17:12.029
IT'S BEEN LIKE THIS
FOR YEARS.

17:12.029 --> 17:14.198
I HAVE
A VERY GOOD LOUKANIKO...

17:14.198 --> 17:15.241
THE BEST.

17:15.241 --> 17:17.451
IF YOU CAN'T BE  HONEST
WITH YOURSELF,

17:17.451 --> 17:19.203
THEN I'M NOT HERE
TO.

17:19.203 --> 17:21.289
YOU ASKED ME.

17:21.289 --> 17:22.832
IF YOU ASK SOMEBODY ELSE,

17:22.832 --> 17:24.250
<i>THEY MIGHT GIVE YOU</i>
<i>A DIFFERENT RATING.</i>

17:24.250 --> 17:26.294
WELL, YOU'RE
THE  OWNER.

17:26.294 --> 17:28.212
<i>CHRISTINA...</i>

17:28.212 --> 17:30.631
IS THIS THE WAY
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN?
NO.

17:35.219 --> 17:37.346
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
IT IS WHAT IT IS NOW...

17:37.346 --> 17:38.973
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THIS.

17:38.973 --> 17:39.097
<i>IT STARTED A YEAR AGO.</i>
YEAH.

17:39.097 --> 17:42.643
<i>IT STARTED A YEAR AGO.</i>
YEAH.

17:42.643 --> 17:45.021
THAT'S HOW
WE ALWAYS DID IT.

17:45.021 --> 17:47.523
NO.

17:47.523 --> 17:50.151
I'M DEEPLY CONCERNED
OF THE LACK OF RESPECT AND LOVE

17:50.151 --> 17:51.235
<i>IN YOUR MARRIAGE,</i>

17:51.235 --> 17:53.196
<i>BUT ONE THING</i>
<i>YOU'VE CONFIRMED</i>

17:53.196 --> 17:55.698
ACROSS THIS LUNCH IS THAT
THERE'S NO LOVE IN YOUR FOOD.

17:55.698 --> 17:59.619
I'M EMBARRASSED.

17:59.619 --> 18:03.664
HELL.

18:03.664 --> 18:06.209
I'M PISSED OFF.
I'M ANGRY.

18:06.209 --> 18:07.251
THE FOOD IS NOT THE PROBLEM.

18:07.251 --> 18:09.097
OH,.

18:09.097 --> 18:10.463
OH,.

18:21.139 --> 18:23.141
AS MANNY AND CHRISTINA
ARE QUICK TO POINT THE FINGER

18:23.141 --> 18:25.644
AT EACH OTHER FOR THE FAILURE
OF THE RESTAURANT...

18:25.644 --> 18:27.813
EVELYN, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING TO MEET ME.

18:27.813 --> 18:29.439
APPRECIATE IT.
HOW ARE YOU?

18:29.439 --> 18:31.400
CHEF RAMSAY DECIDES TO GET
SOME CLARITY

18:31.400 --> 18:32.484
FROM THEIR DAUGHTER EVELYN,

18:32.484 --> 18:34.569
WHO WORKS
PART TIME AT KATI ALLO.

18:34.569 --> 18:36.321
WOW, I MEAN,
FIRST OF ALL,

18:36.321 --> 18:40.409
WHEN YOU THINK HOW PEACEFUL
AND TRANQUIL THIS SETTING IS,

18:40.409 --> 18:42.077
IT'S THE OPPOSITE END
OF THE SPECTRUM

18:42.077 --> 18:43.078
OF WHAT I'VE JUST LEFT.

18:43.078 --> 18:44.246
<i>HAVE YOU WITNESSED</i>
<i>THAT RECENTLY?</i>

18:44.246 --> 18:46.248
ARE YOU KIDDING?

18:46.248 --> 18:47.513
I'M THE REFEREE.

18:47.513 --> 18:47.791
I'M THE REFEREE.

18:47.791 --> 18:49.209
I'M THE ONE THAT'S LIKE, "ALL
RIGHT, EVERYONE IN THEIR CORNER.

18:49.209 --> 18:51.628
<i>CALM DOWN."</i>
YEAH.

18:51.628 --> 18:54.715
HOW LONG HAS IT
BEEN LIKE THIS?
FOR TOO LONG.

18:54.715 --> 18:57.134
YOU CAN HAVE MULTIPLE
OWNERS IN A BUSINESS,

18:57.134 --> 18:59.803
BUT IF THERE ISN'T ONE VOICE,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET ANYWHERE.

18:59.803 --> 19:01.930
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

19:01.930 --> 19:03.348
WHEN MY DAD SEES YOU AND HE
SAYS, "WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:03.348 --> 19:04.933
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO DO IT THAT WAY",

19:04.933 --> 19:07.310
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
WHAT'S SOMEONE TO THINK?

19:07.310 --> 19:09.938
SO YOU DO YOUR OWN THING.
<i>YEAH.</i>

19:09.938 --> 19:12.399
HAVE YOU SEEN YOUR FATHER
CHANGE OVER THE YEARS?

19:12.399 --> 19:14.818
I HAVE.

19:14.818 --> 19:17.154
<i>I THINK THE PRESSURE HAS</i>
<i>GOTTEN TO THE BOTH OF 'EM.</i>

19:17.154 --> 19:17.513
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS

19:17.513 --> 19:18.447
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS

19:18.447 --> 19:21.658
HE TENDS TO BE THE FIRST ONE
TO CHECK OUT, JUST GO.

19:21.658 --> 19:24.745
YEAH, YOU CAN SEE THAT.
YEAH.

19:24.745 --> 19:26.288
BUT, YOU KNOW,
THEY'RE BOTH NOT PERFECT.

19:26.288 --> 19:29.040
AND DEFINITELY MY MOM'S MADE
SOME MISTAKES AS WELL.

19:29.040 --> 19:31.585
REALLY?

19:31.585 --> 19:36.548
SHE DOESN'T LIKE TO MAYBE
APPEASE A CUSTOMER WHO'S UPSET.

19:36.548 --> 19:39.509
AND MY DAD--
SHE DOESN'T TRUST HIM.

19:39.509 --> 19:42.721
MAYBE IT'S EASIER
TO POINT A FINGER

19:42.721 --> 19:44.681
<i>THAN TO LOOK</i>
<i>IN THE MIRROR.</i>

19:44.681 --> 19:47.058
THIS IS THE MOST SENSIBLE
CONVERSATION I'VE HAD

19:47.058 --> 19:47.513
SINCE I'VE BEEN
IN QUEENS.

19:47.513 --> 19:50.187
SINCE I'VE BEEN
IN QUEENS.

19:50.187 --> 19:52.481
HOW CLOSE ARE THEY
TO DIVORCING?

19:52.481 --> 19:54.357
YOU KNOW,
THEY'VE BEEN SO CLOSE.

19:54.357 --> 19:57.110
<i>AS OF RECENT,</i>
<i>IT'S, YOU KNOW,</i>

19:57.110 --> 19:58.403
"I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE."

19:58.403 --> 20:01.948
BUT I DO BELIEVE
IT'S A LOT.

20:01.948 --> 20:03.533
IT TAKES A TOLL ON ME,

20:03.533 --> 20:05.494
BECAUSE NO ONE WANTS TO SEE
THEIR FAMILY THAT WAY,

20:05.494 --> 20:06.953
<i>ESPECIALLY THEIR PARENTS.</i>

20:06.953 --> 20:09.206
BUT THEN--UGH.

20:12.626 --> 20:16.254
YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT THEM
TO WORK 15 HOURS A DAY,

20:16.254 --> 20:17.513
<i>7 DAYS A WEEK,</i>
<i>FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.</i>

20:17.513 --> 20:18.757
<i>7 DAYS A WEEK,</i>
<i>FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.</i>

20:18.757 --> 20:20.967
YOU DESERVE MORE
OUT OF LIFE.

20:20.967 --> 20:24.095
AND THEY'VE GIVEN SO MUCH.

20:24.095 --> 20:25.931
I WISH I HAD AN EASY FIX.

20:25.931 --> 20:29.559
I WISH I COULD FIX IT FOR THEM,
BUT THEY JUST NEED--

20:29.559 --> 20:32.103
THEY NEED SOMEBODY
TO BRING 'EM BACK TO LIFE.

20:32.103 --> 20:34.022
THEY NEED TO JUST OPEN UP
THEIR EYES AGAIN

20:34.022 --> 20:38.485
AND JUST LEARN
TO COMMUNICATE.

20:38.485 --> 20:39.986
I FEEL FOR YOU.

20:39.986 --> 20:42.155
<i>THANK YOU</i>
<i>FOR BEING HONEST.</i>

20:42.155 --> 20:45.575
OKAY?
HANG IN THERE, WILL YOU?

20:45.575 --> 20:47.513
TONIGHT I'M SEEING
THE RESTAURANT.

20:47.513 --> 20:47.619
TONIGHT I'M SEEING
THE RESTAURANT.

20:47.619 --> 20:49.162
<i>I'LL BE ON SERVICE.</i>

20:49.162 --> 20:51.456
<i>I'LL BE EVERYWHERE,</i>
<i>WATCHING EVERYTHING.</i>

20:51.456 --> 20:53.208
THANK YOU.

21:00.966 --> 21:02.259
THE SHISH KABOB.
THE SHISH KABOB.

21:02.259 --> 21:04.970
AND FOR YOU?
I'LL HAVE
THE PASTITSIO.

21:04.970 --> 21:09.891
DELUXE PASTITSIO, GYRO PLATTER,
FRIED CALAMARI...

21:09.891 --> 21:11.518
SO HOW DOES THE LINE WORK?

21:11.518 --> 21:13.854
WHO OPERATES THE GRILL?

21:13.854 --> 21:15.605
THE GRILL?
I OPERATE THE GRILL.

21:15.605 --> 21:16.898
<i>WHAT ARE YOU ACTUALLY COOKING?</i>

21:16.898 --> 21:17.513
ANYTHING THAT COMES
CHARBROILED--

21:17.513 --> 21:19.734
ANYTHING THAT COMES
CHARBROILED--

21:19.734 --> 21:21.236
CHICKEN KABOB,
SHISH KABOB, GYRO.

21:21.236 --> 21:22.237
OKAY, GREAT.

21:24.865 --> 21:26.825
MANNY, WHY ARE YOU
CUTTING THEM WITH A KNIFE?

21:26.825 --> 21:28.034
YOU DON'T KNOW
IF THEY'RE COOKED YET?

21:28.034 --> 21:29.327
I WANT TO MAKE SURE.

21:29.327 --> 21:30.996
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
PEOPLE COMPLAINING.

21:30.996 --> 21:34.791
<i>SO YOU SLICED THEM IN HALF.</i>
<i>THEY'RE JUST GONNA GET DRY.</i>

21:34.791 --> 21:35.834
AFTER 14 YEARS,
YOU'D THINK YOU'D KNOW

21:35.834 --> 21:38.003
HOW TO COOK A
CHICKEN CUBE.

21:39.379 --> 21:41.131
THE CHICKEN IS VERY DRY?
IT'S OVERCOOKED?
<i>YES.</i>

21:41.131 --> 21:43.633
WHAT HAPPENED?
THEY DON'T LIKE IT?

21:43.633 --> 21:44.634
<i>IT'S TOO DRY.</i>

21:47.596 --> 21:50.932
WHAT IS THAT?
WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM?

21:50.932 --> 21:53.143
FOR THE SPECIAL?
THAT'S ALL HOT.

21:53.143 --> 21:54.144
NO, I KNOW, BUT WAIT.
IT'S ALL HOT.

21:54.144 --> 21:55.562
WHERE IS IT COMING FROM?

21:55.562 --> 21:59.566
SO YOU HAVE A TEAM OF CHEFS
DOWNSTAIRS AS WELL?

21:59.566 --> 22:01.610
ONLY ONE WOMAN?

22:04.905 --> 22:07.657
HELLO?

22:07.657 --> 22:09.826
<i>HELLO?</i>
<i>HELLO?</i>

22:09.826 --> 22:11.286
WOW.

22:11.286 --> 22:13.121
CHRISTINA, THERE'S
A LADY DOWNSTAIRS

22:13.121 --> 22:14.247
THAT HEATS THIS STUFF UP.

22:14.247 --> 22:16.082
YEAH, SHE PUTS THESE
IN THE MICROWAVE.

22:16.082 --> 22:17.513
WHAT IS THAT?

22:17.513 --> 22:17.667
WHAT IS THAT?

22:17.667 --> 22:19.669
WITH SO MUCH FOOD
COMING FROM DOWNSTAIRS...

22:19.669 --> 22:21.129
HELLO?

22:21.129 --> 22:23.131
CHEF RAMSAY KNOWS
HE NEEDS TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK

22:23.131 --> 22:24.424
AT THIS UNUSUAL OPERATION.

22:24.424 --> 22:25.467
OH, SO THERE'S THE LIFT THERE.

22:25.467 --> 22:27.552
<i>OKAY.</i>

22:30.305 --> 22:33.808
<i>WHEN WAS THAT</i>
<i>CLEANED LAST?</i>

22:33.808 --> 22:34.893
SERIOUSLY?

22:34.893 --> 22:37.687
WHAT'S THAT?
WELL, LOOK AT THAT.

22:37.687 --> 22:38.688
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE.

22:38.688 --> 22:41.358
WHY ARE THEY KEEPING THIS?

22:41.358 --> 22:43.026
THEY'RE GONNA KILL SOMEBODY.

22:43.026 --> 22:46.655
THERE'S RAW MEAT.
COOKED MEAT.

22:46.655 --> 22:47.513
WHY IN THE?

22:47.513 --> 22:49.032
WHY IN THE?

22:49.032 --> 22:50.784
OH, MY GOD.

22:50.784 --> 22:52.077
THEY'RE GONNA BE RESPONSIBLE

22:52.077 --> 22:54.079
FOR POISONING
ALL OF  QUEENS.

22:54.079 --> 22:56.331
UGH!

22:56.331 --> 22:57.707
THESE ARE ALL ROTTEN.

22:57.707 --> 22:58.833
BLOODY HELL.

22:58.833 --> 23:01.711
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

23:01.711 --> 23:05.382
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE  IS GOING ON.

23:05.382 --> 23:08.218
HAVE YOU GOT TWO SECONDS?

23:08.218 --> 23:11.137
WHAT I SAW AT LUNCHTIME,
I KNEW WE HAD PROBLEMS,

23:11.137 --> 23:13.807
BUT I'M MORE
CONCERNED NOT JUST

23:13.807 --> 23:15.558
ABOUT THE
THAT'S GOING ON UPSTAIRS.

23:15.558 --> 23:17.513
BOTH OF YOU AND EVELYN
COME HERE.

23:17.513 --> 23:17.519
BOTH OF YOU AND EVELYN
COME HERE.

23:17.519 --> 23:21.231
LET ME SHOW YOU VERY QUICKLY
HOW MUCH YOU'VE CHECKED OUT.

23:24.734 --> 23:26.319
HOW OFTEN ARE YOU
IN THIS FRIDGE?

23:26.319 --> 23:27.946
<i>- EVERY DAY.</i>
<i>- EVERY DAY?</i>

23:27.946 --> 23:29.364
WHAT IS THAT?

23:29.364 --> 23:30.490
THIS IS THE GYRO
WE HAD EARLIER.

23:30.490 --> 23:31.491
TAKE IT.

23:31.491 --> 23:32.993
PUT IT ON THERE.

23:32.993 --> 23:35.036
- WHAT'S THAT?
<i>- THIS IS CHICKEN.</i>

23:35.036 --> 23:39.040
SO YOU GOT COOKED GYRO
COOLING DOWN,

23:39.040 --> 23:42.669
AND YOU'VE GOT COOKED MEAT
SAT NEXT TO RAW CHICKEN.

23:42.669 --> 23:44.045
IN A DIFFERENT TRAY, CHEF.

23:44.045 --> 23:45.422
IN A DIFFERENT TRAY.

23:45.422 --> 23:47.513
AND ON TOP OF A COVERED BASKET
OVER THE CHICKEN.

23:47.513 --> 23:48.925
AND ON TOP OF A COVERED BASKET
OVER THE CHICKEN.

23:48.925 --> 23:51.302
<i>YOU CANNOT STORE</i>
<i>COOKED MEAT</i>

23:51.302 --> 23:55.974
ANYWHERE NEAR RAW MEAT--
RULE NUMBER ONE.

23:55.974 --> 23:59.602
JUST SMELL THAT.

23:59.602 --> 24:01.938
JUST SMELL THAT.

24:01.938 --> 24:03.523
SMELL THAT.

24:03.523 --> 24:04.816
SMELL IT!

24:04.816 --> 24:05.817
YES, I SMELL IT.

24:05.817 --> 24:08.987
YEAH.
WHAT'S IT SMELL OF?

24:08.987 --> 24:10.739
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT THAT SMELLS OF?

24:10.739 --> 24:11.990
'CAUSE HE'S IN DENIAL!

24:11.990 --> 24:12.991
IT SMELLS LIKE.

24:12.991 --> 24:14.784
THAT IS DISGUSTING!

24:16.578 --> 24:17.513
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA HOW LONG
A JAR NEEDS TO SIT--

24:17.513 --> 24:19.956
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA HOW LONG
A JAR NEEDS TO SIT--

24:19.956 --> 24:21.750
WHERE DID YOU FIND IT?

24:21.750 --> 24:23.752
WHERE THE
DO YOU THINK I FOUND THIS?

24:23.752 --> 24:25.962
IF IT'S OLD, WE SHOULD HAVE
JUST THROWN IT OUT.

24:25.962 --> 24:27.338
THERE'S NO REASON
TO KEEP IT.

24:27.338 --> 24:29.799
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA HOW MANY YEARS
THAT NEEDS TO BE HERE?

24:29.799 --> 24:32.093
- AND ALL THESE JARS.
-  EIGHT YEARS.

24:32.093 --> 24:34.846
ALL THESE JARS,
ON MY CHILDREN'S LIFE,

24:34.846 --> 24:36.765
WERE STORED IN THE BACK
OF THE FRIDGE.

24:36.765 --> 24:38.433
JUST--
UGH!

24:38.433 --> 24:39.851
<i>THIS HAS BEEN</i>
<i>EIGHT YEARS OF IT.</i>

24:39.851 --> 24:40.935
UGH!

24:40.935 --> 24:43.855
THAT IS DISGUSTING!

24:43.855 --> 24:46.149
<i>GIVE ME ONE MORE EXCUSE,</i>

24:46.149 --> 24:47.513
AND I'M GONNA FLIP
MY  LID!

24:47.513 --> 24:48.109
AND I'M GONNA FLIP
MY  LID!

24:49.778 --> 24:53.656
THIS PLACE RIGHT NOW
IS A  HELLHOLE.

24:53.656 --> 24:58.328
AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT JARS
OF FAKE CAVIAR

24:58.328 --> 25:00.914
<i>IN A FRIDGE</i>
<i>FOR NEARLY EIGHT YEARS,</i>

25:00.914 --> 25:02.540
THAT'S JUST AN INKLING

25:02.540 --> 25:06.086
TO HOW DYSFUNCTIONAL
THIS PLACE IS,

25:06.086 --> 25:07.879
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE
OPERATING IT THIS BADLY,

25:07.879 --> 25:10.215
<i>I CAN HELP YOU</i>
<i>IN TWO MINUTES!</i>

25:10.215 --> 25:13.218
I CAN GIVE YOU THE BEST
ADVICE YOU'LL EVER GET!

25:13.218 --> 25:16.596
LOCK THE  DOOR
AND CLOSE IT DOWN!

25:26.897 --> 25:28.607
TWO HOURS INTO DINNER SERVICE,

25:28.607 --> 25:31.527
CHEF RAMSAY HAS MADE
SOME SHOCKING...

25:31.527 --> 25:32.694
THESE ARE ALL ROTTEN.

25:32.694 --> 25:33.987
DISGUSTING...

25:33.987 --> 25:35.531
JUST SMELL THAT.
UGH!

25:35.531 --> 25:37.616
AND DANGEROUS DISCOVERIES.

25:37.616 --> 25:38.951
THAT IS DISGUSTING!

25:38.951 --> 25:41.453
AND HE OFFERS THE OWNERS
A WORD OF ADVICE.

25:41.453 --> 25:45.332
LOCK THE  DOOR
AND CLOSE IT DOWN!

25:49.461 --> 25:51.964
THIS IS
MY RESPONSIBILITY?

25:51.964 --> 25:53.939
WHO'S RESPONSIBILITY
IS IT?

25:53.939 --> 25:54.424
WHO'S RESPONSIBILITY
IS IT?

25:54.424 --> 25:57.094
THE PEOPLE
THAT WE HAVE HERE,

25:57.094 --> 25:58.554
AND I'M TALKING FOR YEARS.

25:58.554 --> 26:03.433
YOU PAY CHEAP WORKERS,
THEY DO A CHEAP JOB.

26:03.433 --> 26:04.643
THIS IS WHAT THEY DO.

26:04.643 --> 26:07.187
I THINK THE POINT
IS WHAT YOU'RE MISSING.

26:07.187 --> 26:08.605
<i>THIS IS WHAT THEY DO.</i>

26:08.605 --> 26:10.399
THIS IS THE WORKERS WE HAVE.

26:10.399 --> 26:12.317
BUT SOMEONE HAS TO COME IN
AND CHECK IT.

26:12.317 --> 26:14.653
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THESE THINGS, EVELYN.

26:14.653 --> 26:15.904
I HAVE NO IDEA
THAT THESE THINGS

26:15.904 --> 26:19.283
WERE EXISTED
IN YOUR REFRIGERATOR.
THAT'S THE POINT.

26:19.283 --> 26:21.618
HOW MANY TIMES, CHRISTINA,
YOU CLEAN THE REFRIGERATOR?

26:21.618 --> 26:22.995
<i>WHAT IS THIS, MAN?</i>

26:22.995 --> 26:23.939
WHAT IS THIS, MAN?

26:23.939 --> 26:24.413
WHAT IS THIS, MAN?

26:24.413 --> 26:26.790
UNBELIEVABLE.

26:26.790 --> 26:28.041
WHO PUT THIS BACK?

26:28.041 --> 26:30.085
JUST CLOSE THE  FRIDGE
FOR A SECOND.

26:30.085 --> 26:32.838
LET ME ASK YOU
ONE QUESTION.
YES.

26:32.838 --> 26:35.257
SO IT'S SOMEONE ELSE'S
JOB TO DO THIS,

26:35.257 --> 26:36.967
AND IT'S SOMEONE ELSE'S
JOB TO DO THAT, RIGHT?

26:36.967 --> 26:39.303
WHAT'S YOUR JOB
AS AN OWNER, THEN?

26:39.303 --> 26:42.306
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO CHECK
TO SEE WHAT YOUR STAFF IS DOING?

26:42.306 --> 26:44.141
YES. YES.
SO?

26:44.141 --> 26:48.729
DADDY, YOU HAVE TO TAKE
SOME RESPONSIBILITY HERE.

26:48.729 --> 26:51.231
ARE YOU LISTENING?
YES, I'M LISTENING,
EVELYN.

26:51.231 --> 26:52.858
<i>THE POINT CHEF RAMSAY'S</i>
<i>TRYING TO MAKE IS,</i>

26:52.858 --> 26:53.939
<i>WHAT'S YOUR</i>
<i>RESPONSIBILITY?</i>

26:53.939 --> 26:55.152
<i>WHAT'S YOUR</i>
<i>RESPONSIBILITY?</i>

26:55.152 --> 26:56.403
YOU JUST HIRED
SOME GUY AND SAY,

26:56.403 --> 26:58.322
"OH, WHEN YOU'RE DONE,
YOU JUST PUT THIS IN HERE."

26:58.322 --> 26:59.489
AND YOU NEVER
CHECK THEM?

26:59.489 --> 27:01.950
<i>WHO'S CHECKING THEM?</i>

27:01.950 --> 27:03.952
EVELYN, HOW MANY TIMES
I TOLD YOUR MOTHER

27:03.952 --> 27:06.121
<i>WE HAVE TO GET</i>
<i>THE NEW PEOPLE</i>

27:06.121 --> 27:08.415
IF THAT'S THE ONLY
WAY TO CLEAN HOUSE?

27:08.415 --> 27:10.167
YOU'RE STILL NOT
GETTING IT, DADDY.

27:10.167 --> 27:11.627
COME ON! WHAT DO YOU MEAN
I'M NOT GETTING IT?

27:11.627 --> 27:13.920
AND I'M STILL BEHIND THE GRILL,
BEHIND THIS.

27:13.920 --> 27:15.505
I'M UP TO HERE AGAIN!

27:15.505 --> 27:18.592
IT'S YOUR
RESTAURANT!

27:18.592 --> 27:21.261
YES, I KNOW, BABY.

27:21.261 --> 27:23.305
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU DON'T GET IT, DADDY!

27:23.305 --> 27:23.939
YOU HAVE TO TAKE OWNERSHIP

27:23.939 --> 27:24.973
YOU HAVE TO TAKE OWNERSHIP

27:24.973 --> 27:26.933
OF THIS PLACE IF IT'S
YOUR RESTAURANT.

27:26.933 --> 27:30.437
YOU CAN'T JUST WALK AROUND AND
SAYING YOU'RE THE  OWNER!

27:30.437 --> 27:32.481
I NEED FRESH AIR.

27:32.481 --> 27:35.776
MY FATHER--HE NEEDS TO WAKE UP
AND SMELL THE GREEK COFFEE.

27:35.776 --> 27:37.402
THIS IS YOUR RESTAURANT.

27:37.402 --> 27:41.323
YOU PLAYED A REALLY BIG PART
IN WHY IT'S THIS BAD.

27:41.323 --> 27:42.783
AND YOU CANNOT POINT FINGERS.

27:42.783 --> 27:46.328
OTHERWISE, LIKE CHEF SAID, CLOSE
THE  DOORS AND GET OUT.

27:47.788 --> 27:48.789
DAD?

27:50.791 --> 27:52.334
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO?

27:52.334 --> 27:53.939
YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND
IT STARTS WITH YOU.

27:53.939 --> 27:56.088
YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND
IT STARTS WITH YOU.

27:56.088 --> 28:00.926
YOU HAVE TO STAND UP
AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.

28:00.926 --> 28:04.513
IT'S NOT MY FOOD.
IT'S CHRISTINA'S RECIPES.

28:04.513 --> 28:06.431
SEE?
THERE YOU GO AGAIN.

28:06.431 --> 28:08.600
- DAD.
- HELL.

28:08.600 --> 28:10.977
CHEF, I'M NOT
100% RESPONSIBLE.

28:10.977 --> 28:12.312
<i>THAT'S--I WANT YOU</i>
<i>TO KNOW THAT.</i>

28:12.312 --> 28:13.772
<i>WHAT I'VE BEEN</i>
<i>STRUGGLING WITH</i>

28:13.772 --> 28:16.358
IS I DON'T THINK
YOU HAVE THE WILL.

28:16.358 --> 28:18.360
<i>YOU COULDN'T HAVE BEEN</i>
<i>LIKE THIS</i>

28:18.360 --> 28:20.445
14 YEARS AGO.

28:21.988 --> 28:23.939
CAN I JUST HAVE TWO MINUTES
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER?

28:23.939 --> 28:24.324
CAN I JUST HAVE TWO MINUTES
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER?

28:24.324 --> 28:26.576
YES.

28:30.080 --> 28:32.290
I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

28:32.290 --> 28:34.084
EVERY TIME I TRY
TO POINT THINGS OUT,

28:34.084 --> 28:35.836
<i>HE'S JUST BLAMING</i>
<i>OTHER PEOPLE.</i>

28:35.836 --> 28:37.754
HE DOES LIKE
TO POINT FINGERS.

28:37.754 --> 28:40.424
<i>I'VE GOT SOME</i>
<i>SERIOUS CONCERNS,</i>

28:40.424 --> 28:41.758
BUT RIGHT NOW
THE ONLY REASON

28:41.758 --> 28:44.136
WHY I'M STAYING
IS BECAUSE OF YOU.

28:44.136 --> 28:46.138
I'M 150% COMMITTED.

28:46.138 --> 28:48.390
YOU I HAVE NO DOUBT IN.
YOUR DAD I DO.

28:48.390 --> 28:50.183
NOW GET SOME REST.
I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.

28:50.183 --> 28:51.726
THANK YOU, SIR.
OKAY.

28:51.726 --> 28:53.645
TAKE CARE.
THANK YOU.

28:56.898 --> 28:59.651
THIS MORNING CHEF RAMSAY
WANTS MANNY AND CHRISTINA

28:59.651 --> 29:02.863
TO UNDERSTAND HOW DESTRUCTIVE
THEY'VE BEEN TO EACH OTHER.

29:02.863 --> 29:04.573
WHEN DO WE DRAW A LINE
IN THE SAND AND SAY,

29:04.573 --> 29:07.617
"MOM, DAD, FOR GOD'S SAKE,
GET ON THE SAME PAGE"?

29:07.617 --> 29:09.494
AND HE IS HOPING, WITH THE HELP
OF THEIR DAUGHTER...

29:09.494 --> 29:13.081
IT'S A BIG ASK, BUT I NEED YOU
TO DRIVE THAT MESSAGE HOME.

29:13.081 --> 29:14.749
THEY WILL FINALLY SEE
THE DAMAGE THEY HAVE DONE.

29:14.749 --> 29:16.418
MORNING.
HI.

29:16.418 --> 29:18.420
HOW ARE YOU BOTH?

29:18.420 --> 29:21.631
OKAY, BAD DAY YESTERDAY.

29:21.631 --> 29:23.341
<i>LOTS OF ISSUES.</i>

29:23.341 --> 29:23.939
<i>AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE</i>
<i>TO WORK ON ANY OF THEM,</i>

29:23.939 --> 29:25.844
<i>AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE</i>
<i>TO WORK ON ANY OF THEM,</i>

29:25.844 --> 29:26.928
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DEAL

29:26.928 --> 29:28.722
WITH SOMETHING
MORE IMPORTANT FIRST--

29:28.722 --> 29:31.641
<i>THE BOTH OF YOU.</i>

29:31.641 --> 29:33.393
EVELYN.

29:33.393 --> 29:35.395
<i>RESTAURANT ASIDE,</i>

29:35.395 --> 29:38.565
YOU GUYS HAVE ISSUES
COMMUNICATING.

29:40.567 --> 29:42.277
WHAT'S REALLY HARD FOR ME

29:42.277 --> 29:46.490
<i>IS TO SEE HOW</i>
<i>JUST SEPARATED YOU ARE.</i>

29:46.490 --> 29:48.200
<i>I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU</i>

29:48.200 --> 29:51.036
BE SO HURTFUL
TOWARDS ONE ANOTHER.

29:51.036 --> 29:53.939
<i>YOU HAVE SO MUCH TO BE</i>
<i>HAPPY ABOUT AND PROUD OF.</i>

29:53.939 --> 29:55.373
<i>YOU HAVE SO MUCH TO BE</i>
<i>HAPPY ABOUT AND PROUD OF.</i>

29:55.373 --> 29:56.374
<i>AND IT'S TIME</i>

29:56.374 --> 29:58.251
THAT YOU WORK TOGETHER.

30:01.588 --> 30:04.382
<i>BUT THERE'S NO MORE</i>
<i>POINTING FINGERS.</i>

30:04.382 --> 30:07.135
I CANNOT BE IN THE MIDDLE.
IT KILLS ME ON THE INSIDE.

30:07.135 --> 30:08.345
IT BREAKS MY HEART.

30:28.365 --> 30:31.326
I WILL TRY MY BEST,
AND I WILL DO MY BEST.

30:31.326 --> 30:32.369
BELIEVE ME.

30:32.369 --> 30:33.828
CHRISTINA,

30:33.828 --> 30:36.706
<i>IT GOES FOR BOTH OF YOU.</i>
<i>YOU HAVE TO BE SUPPORTIVE.</i>

30:36.706 --> 30:39.751
WITH ALL MY HEART.

30:44.839 --> 30:46.091
<i>WE HAVE TO DO IT TOGETHER.</i>

30:46.091 --> 30:48.260
WE HAVE TO SHARE
RESPONSIBILITIES.

30:48.260 --> 30:50.303
<i>AND WE HAVE TO BE UNITED.</i>

30:50.303 --> 30:52.055
TWO PEOPLE, ONE VOICE.

30:52.055 --> 30:53.939
WE HAVE TO DO IT.
THAT'S IT.

30:53.939 --> 30:55.225
WE HAVE TO DO IT.
THAT'S IT.

30:55.225 --> 30:57.435
I'LL LEAVE YOU GUYS ALONE
FOR A FEW MINUTES.

30:57.435 --> 31:00.063
<i>I'LL SEE YOU BACK</i>
<i>AT THE RESTAURANT. THANK YOU.</i>

31:00.063 --> 31:03.733
THANK YOU SO MUCH, SIR.

31:03.733 --> 31:06.736
EVELYN IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

31:06.736 --> 31:09.906
WE HAVE TO STOP POINTING FINGERS
TO EACH OTHER.

31:09.906 --> 31:12.867
WE HAVE TO COMMUNICATE
IN A BETTER WAY.

31:15.537 --> 31:17.622
AND WE HAVE TO UNITED

31:17.622 --> 31:20.500
AND TO DO WHATEVER
WE HAVE TO DO TOGETHER.

31:32.838 --> 31:35.132
AFTER WHAT APPEARS TO BE
A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH

31:35.132 --> 31:36.424
WITH CHRISTINA
AND MANNY...

31:36.424 --> 31:38.885
LET'S GO. PLEASE.

31:38.885 --> 31:40.887
CHEF RAMSAY CAN FINALLY TURN
HIS ATTENTION TO THE FOOD.

31:40.887 --> 31:44.349
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU DID SOMETHING TOGETHER?

31:44.349 --> 31:45.350
YEARS.

31:45.350 --> 31:46.685
- YEARS?
<i>- YEARS.</i>

31:46.685 --> 31:48.895
I WANT YOU TO DO
SOMETHING WITH ME NOW.

31:48.895 --> 31:50.564
THE THREE OF US
TOGETHER--LET'S GO.

31:50.564 --> 31:52.983
<i>SEA BASS.</i>
<i>I'VE SEASONED THE FISH.</i>

31:52.983 --> 31:55.026
I'VE SEASONED THE FLOUR--

31:55.026 --> 31:55.819
SALT AND PEPPER.

31:55.819 --> 31:57.821
AND THE BASS GOES
INTO A HOT PAN.

31:57.821 --> 31:59.304
<i>HAVE A TASTE OF THAT.</i>

31:59.304 --> 32:00.615
<i>HAVE A TASTE OF THAT.</i>

32:00.615 --> 32:02.993
<i>THAT IS A VERY SIMPLE...</i>
MMM.

32:02.993 --> 32:04.870
PUREE OF CAULIFLOWER.

32:04.870 --> 32:06.413
THAT'S CAULIFLOWER?

32:06.413 --> 32:07.664
JUST CAULIFLOWER.

32:07.664 --> 32:09.958
I DO LOVE COOKING, BUT...

32:09.958 --> 32:11.334
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS,
I WAS LAZY,

32:11.334 --> 32:14.629
AND, I MEAN, I LOST THE TOUCH.
I LOST THE, UH, PASSION.

32:14.629 --> 32:16.756
HOW DOES THAT TASTE?
THIS IS AMAZING.

32:16.756 --> 32:17.966
OF COURSE I WANT IT BACK.

32:17.966 --> 32:19.968
I'M WATCHING EVERYTHING
COOKING.

32:19.968 --> 32:21.303
YOU PLACE ON.

32:21.303 --> 32:22.888
IT'S GOING TO BE
A LOT OF HARD WORK,

32:22.888 --> 32:24.764
BUT I'M UP FOR IT,
I'M READY.

32:24.764 --> 32:27.434
NOW, I WANT YOU BOTH JUST
TO MAKE A PORTION TOGETHER.

32:27.434 --> 32:29.186
YES.

32:29.186 --> 32:29.304
OKAY.

32:29.304 --> 32:32.439
OKAY.

32:32.439 --> 32:34.816
YEAH.

32:46.786 --> 32:47.787
LIKE THIS?

32:47.787 --> 32:49.706
IT'S GOTTA BE CRISPY.

32:49.706 --> 32:51.208
THIS IS
A NEW BEGINNING FOR US.

32:51.208 --> 32:53.835
CHRISTINA AND I--
WE GOTTA GROW AS A TEAM.

32:53.835 --> 32:57.339
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY TO SUCCEED
AND SAVE THIS BUSINESS.

32:57.339 --> 32:59.304
I'M VERY HAPPY.

32:59.304 --> 33:00.133
I'M VERY HAPPY.

33:04.846 --> 33:07.349
WITH CHRISTINA AND MANNY NOT
ONLY COMMITTING TO EACH OTHER,

33:07.349 --> 33:08.975
BUT ALSO TO THE RESTAURANT,

33:08.975 --> 33:11.311
CHEF RAMSAY AND HIS TEAM
SPEND THE NIGHT

33:11.311 --> 33:13.021
COMPLETELY OVERHAULING
KATI ALLO,

33:13.021 --> 33:15.023
WITH A LOOK
THAT IS SURE TO REMIND THEM

33:15.023 --> 33:18.109
OF THEIR GREEK HERITAGE.

33:18.109 --> 33:19.569
<i>COME OVER, PLEASE.</i>

33:19.569 --> 33:20.612
YOU READY TO GO INSIDE?

33:20.612 --> 33:21.696
YES!
YES!

33:21.696 --> 33:23.490
<i>LADIES FIRST--LET'S GO.</i>

33:23.490 --> 33:25.075
<i>JUMP IN.</i>

33:25.075 --> 33:26.618
OH, MY GOD!

33:26.618 --> 33:29.304
<i>WELCOME TO THE NEW</i>
<i>KATI ALLO.</i>

33:29.304 --> 33:29.329
<i>WELCOME TO THE NEW</i>

<i>OH, MY GOD!</i>
<i>THIS IS WONDERFUL!</i>

33:32.916 --> 33:35.794
THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL!
THIS IS SO PRETTY!

33:35.794 --> 33:38.338
HOW BEAUTIFUL IS THIS?

33:38.338 --> 33:41.758
OH, MY GOD!
THIS IS A DREAM!
OH, GOD!

33:41.758 --> 33:44.511
<i>- THAT'S BEAUTIFUL!</i>
<i>- WELCOME TO YOUR NEW RESTAURANT/</i>

33:44.511 --> 33:46.388

<i>I LOVE IT!</i>

33:47.931 --> 33:49.432
<i>THIS IS WONDERFUL!</i>

33:49.432 --> 33:51.810
IT'S WONDERFUL!

33:54.062 --> 33:56.648
IT'S BEAUTIFUL!
IT'S BEAUTIFUL!

33:56.648 --> 33:59.304
GONE IS THAT DREARY,
DRAB INTERIOR.

33:59.304 --> 33:59.317
GONE IS THAT DREARY,
DRAB INTERIOR.

33:59.317 --> 34:01.319
WE'VE BRIGHTENED
EVERYTHING UP--

34:01.319 --> 34:02.737
A STUNNING
FRESH COAT OF PAINT.

34:02.737 --> 34:03.822
BRIGHT!

34:03.822 --> 34:04.823
<i>ORIGINAL ARTWORK...</i>

34:04.823 --> 34:06.032
<i>THAT'S GREECE.</i>

34:06.032 --> 34:07.826
<i>HAND-PAINTED ON THOSE WALLS.</i>

34:07.826 --> 34:09.077
<i>BLUE SHUTTERS GIVE IT</i>
<i>THAT GREEK FEEL,</i>

34:09.077 --> 34:10.161
<i>JUST LIKE IT IS AT HOME.</i>

34:10.161 --> 34:11.579
<i>HOW BEAUTIFUL IS THAT?</i>

34:11.579 --> 34:13.540
THAT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

34:13.540 --> 34:15.417
FROM THERE,
THE SEATING--

34:15.417 --> 34:19.796
<i>WE'VE UPDATED THE UPHOLSTERY</i>
<i>SO IT FEELS AUTHENTIC,</i>

34:19.796 --> 34:20.839
<i>MEDITERRANEAN.</i>

34:20.839 --> 34:21.881
<i>IT'S BEAUTIFUL!</i>

34:21.881 --> 34:23.758
IT'S BEAUTIFUL!

34:23.758 --> 34:25.176
<i>NOW, CAST YOUR EYES</i>
<i>DOWN THERE. THAT'S--</i>

34:25.176 --> 34:27.345
OH, MY GOD!
I DIDN'T SEE THAT.

34:27.345 --> 34:28.888
<i>OH, MY GOD!</i>

34:28.888 --> 34:29.304
<i>IT IS DONE WITH RECLAIMED WOOD,</i>

34:29.304 --> 34:30.557
<i>IT IS DONE WITH RECLAIMED WOOD,</i>

34:30.557 --> 34:32.475
<i>SO YOU'VE GOT</i>
<i>THAT BEAUTIFUL,</i>

34:32.475 --> 34:34.436
AUTHENTIC GREEK FEEL--
IT'S GORGEOUS.

34:34.436 --> 34:35.895
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.

34:35.895 --> 34:37.689
<i>OH, ONE MORE THING.</i>

34:37.689 --> 34:39.816
I'D LIKE TO FOCUS YOUR
ATTENTION ON THE TABLEWARE--

34:39.816 --> 34:43.820
<i>NEW PLATES, NEW SILVERWARE,</i>
<i>COURTESY OF ONEIDA.</i>

34:43.820 --> 34:46.489
<i>THIS IS A UNIQUE,</i>

34:46.489 --> 34:49.659
DURABLE,
STUNNING TABLEWARE.

34:49.659 --> 34:51.286
IT'S MADE FOR
THE FOOD-SERVICE INDUSTRY,

34:51.286 --> 34:52.620
SO IT CAN TAKE
A BASHING.

34:52.620 --> 34:54.080
<i>THIS IS WONDERFUL!</i>

34:54.080 --> 34:55.415
THIS IS A DREAM!

34:55.415 --> 34:57.625
<i>I'M SO EXCITED!</i>

34:57.625 --> 34:59.085
I'M SO HAPPY!

ARE YOU OKAY?

35:03.423 --> 35:05.925
<i>THANK YOU! THANK YOU!</i>

35:05.925 --> 35:07.719
IT'S BEAUTIFUL!

IT'S ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!

35:11.014 --> 35:14.643
I FEEL SO HAPPY--
ONE-MILLION-DOLLAR WOMAN.

35:14.643 --> 35:15.810
NOW IT'S A REAL PLACE.

35:15.810 --> 35:18.229
NOW IT IS A REAL KATI ALLO.

35:26.738 --> 35:28.657
I WOULD NEVER IMAGINE TO HAVE
A RESTAURANT LIKE THIS.

35:28.657 --> 35:29.304
THIS IS THE KATI ALLO
OF OUR DREAMS.

35:29.304 --> 35:31.076
THIS IS THE KATI ALLO
OF OUR DREAMS.

35:31.076 --> 35:34.079
I'M SO EXCITED.
I'M SO HAPPY.

35:34.079 --> 35:37.832
MY PASSION CAME BACK.

35:37.832 --> 35:39.417
WITH THE EXCITEMENT
OF THE NEW DESIGN

35:39.417 --> 35:40.752
OF THE RESTAURANT
STILL IN THE AIR...

35:40.752 --> 35:42.170
COME DOWN, PLEASE,
MY DARLING.

35:42.170 --> 35:43.838
CHEF RAMSAY IS READY
TO UNVEIL

35:43.838 --> 35:46.883
AN EQUALLY AS DRAMATIC CHANGE
THAT HE HAS MADE TO THE FOOD.

35:46.883 --> 35:48.885
OH, MY GOD!

35:48.885 --> 35:50.345
<i>COME ON DOWN,</i>
<i>PLEASE, GUYS.</i>

35:50.345 --> 35:53.556
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.
MY DREAM, MY DREAM.

35:53.556 --> 35:54.557
- YOUR DREAM.
<i>- MY DREAM.</i>

35:54.557 --> 35:56.351
MY DREAM CAME TRUE.

35:56.351 --> 35:57.894
THE MENU IS
SELF-CONTAINED,

35:57.894 --> 35:59.304
<i>AND IT'S DONE WITH WHAT</i>
<i>WE'VE GOT TO WORK WITH.</i>

35:59.304 --> 35:59.688
<i>AND IT'S DONE WITH WHAT</i>
<i>WE'VE GOT TO WORK WITH.</i>

35:59.688 --> 36:02.607
<i>RED PEPPER HUMMUS--DONE,</i>
<i>OBVIOUSLY, WITH CHICKPEAS,</i>

36:02.607 --> 36:03.942
<i>TAHINI, LEMON, GARLIC,</i>

36:03.942 --> 36:05.652
<i>AND ROASTED RED PEPPERS</i>
<i>RUNNING THROUGH IT.</i>

36:05.652 --> 36:06.861
AND THEN ONE OF MY FAVORITES.

36:06.861 --> 36:08.613
<i>HOW COULD WE NOT</i>
<i>HAVE SPANAKOPITA?</i>

36:08.613 --> 36:10.740
<i>CRUMPLED FETA</i>
<i>AROUND THE OUTSIDE.</i>

36:10.740 --> 36:12.742
<i>STUFFED WITH A DELICIOUS</i>

AND THEN THE BRANZINO.

36:23.795 --> 36:24.963
<i>DELICIOUS. YEAH?</i>

36:24.963 --> 36:25.964
<i>IT LOOKS WONDERFUL.</i>

36:25.964 --> 36:26.965

36:29.304 --> 36:31.594
RIGHT, DIG IN.
YEAH, START TASTING, GUYS.

36:31.594 --> 36:34.514
LET'S GO.

36:34.514 --> 36:37.267
<i>OH, MY GOD.</i>
<i>BEAUTIFUL.</i>

36:37.267 --> 36:38.518
<i>- MMM.</i>
<i>- WOW.</i>

36:38.518 --> 36:40.019
MMM.
REALLY, REALLY GOOD.

36:40.019 --> 36:41.771
<i>SO TASTY, SO DIFFERENT.</i>

36:41.771 --> 36:44.023
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.

36:44.023 --> 36:46.651
DEFINITELY I FELL IN LOVE
WITH THE RESTAURANT AGAIN.

36:46.651 --> 36:49.738
THE NEW MENU THAT
CHEF RAMSAY CREATED--

36:49.738 --> 36:53.283
EVERYTHING
IS AUTHENTIC GREEK.

36:57.912 --> 36:59.304
I LOVE IT.

36:59.304 --> 37:01.666
I LOVE IT.

37:08.715 --> 37:10.967
GOOD EVENING.
WELCOME TO KATI ALLO.

37:10.967 --> 37:14.220
THE ARTWORK IS BEAUTIFUL.
IT REMINDS ME OF GREECE.

37:14.220 --> 37:15.889
I'M GONNA GET
THE GRILLED FLANK STEAK.

37:15.889 --> 37:17.432
FOR TONIGHT'S RELAUNCH,
CHEF RAMSAY

37:17.432 --> 37:20.226
HAS THE FATHER-DAUGHTER DUO
WORKING TOGETHER IN THE KITCHEN.

37:20.226 --> 37:23.104
MANNY, YOU'RE GONNA
BE EXPEDITING.

37:23.104 --> 37:24.314
YEAH.
I WANT TO HEAR YOU.
YES?

37:24.314 --> 37:25.648
YES. YES.
OKAY?

37:25.648 --> 37:26.608
<i>EXCELLENT, FIRST TICKET'S</i>

37:26.608 --> 37:27.609
LET'S GO, GUYS.

37:27.609 --> 37:28.902
LET'S GO.

37:28.902 --> 37:29.304
TWO RED PEPPER HUMMUS.
EVELYN'S WORKING?

37:29.304 --> 37:30.278
TWO RED PEPPER HUMMUS.
EVELYN'S WORKING?

37:30.278 --> 37:31.780

37:31.780 --> 37:33.281
<i>CHICKEN KABOB, TABLE ONE.</i>
<i>LET'S GO.</i>

37:33.281 --> 37:35.366
I THINK FOR THIS RELAUNCH
TO BE SUCCESSFUL,

37:35.366 --> 37:38.036
MY FATHER NEEDS
TO REALLY JUST COMMUNICATE.

37:38.036 --> 37:39.579
I THINK HE CAN STEP IN
AND DO IT.

37:39.579 --> 37:41.206
I JUST THINK HE NEEDS TO BUILD
UP HIS CONFIDENCE A LITTLE BIT.

37:41.206 --> 37:43.124
LET'S GET THESE PEOPLE
FED, BABY!

37:43.124 --> 37:44.501
- WHAT DO WE NEED?
<i>- ONE SPANAKOPITA,</i>

37:44.501 --> 37:46.503
ONE MELITZANOSALATA
RIGHT NOW, PLEASE.

37:46.503 --> 37:47.754
<i>RIGHT NOW. RIGHT NOW.</i>

37:47.754 --> 37:49.422
<i>I GOT TWO SPINACH PIES</i>
<i>AT THE WINDOW.</i>

37:49.422 --> 37:50.507
TAKE IT OUTSIDE.

37:50.507 --> 37:51.800
GOOD MAN.
LET'S GO.

37:51.800 --> 37:53.343
THE FIRST TICKETS
ARE COMPLETED QUICKLY,

37:53.343 --> 37:56.429
AND THE FOOD IS LEAVING
THE KITCHEN AT A STEADY PACE.

37:56.429 --> 37:58.056
MMM.

37:58.056 --> 37:59.304
AND THE DINERS ARE RAVING
ABOUT THE NEW MENU.

37:59.304 --> 38:01.434
AND THE DINERS ARE RAVING
ABOUT THE NEW MENU.

38:03.520 --> 38:05.355
<i>YES?</i>

38:10.735 --> 38:13.196
BUT ONLY 45 MINUTES
INTO SERVICE,

38:13.196 --> 38:15.698
MANNY IS BEGINNING
TO GET OVERWHELMED

38:15.698 --> 38:17.700
AND HAS COMPLETELY LOST TRACK
OF THE ORDERS.

38:17.700 --> 38:18.701
<i>I HAVE FOOD IN THE WINDOW.</i>

38:18.701 --> 38:20.578
I NEED TO KNOW
WHAT TABLES THESE ARE FOR,

38:20.578 --> 38:21.788
AND YOU NEED TO GET THE
SERVERS HERE AND GET 'EM OUT.

38:21.788 --> 38:22.956
<i>LET'S GO!</i>

38:22.956 --> 38:24.123
GETTING CRAZY.

38:24.123 --> 38:25.416
TABLE 73.

38:25.416 --> 38:27.168
SPANAKOPITA,
MELITZANOSALATA--

38:27.168 --> 38:29.170
WAIT. WAIT A SECOND.
WHAT'S THE TABLE?

38:29.170 --> 38:29.304
73.
<i>I DON'T HAVE</i> <i>ANY 73 OVER HERE.</i>

38:29.304 --> 38:31.631
73.
<i>I DON'T HAVE</i> <i>ANY 73 OVER HERE.</i>

38:35.635 --> 38:38.680
WHAT ELSE? WHAT ELSE?
TALK TO ME.

38:38.680 --> 38:42.392
I DON'T HEAR ANYONE TALKING.
WHAT ARE WE DOING RIGHT NOW?

38:42.392 --> 38:43.726
SIR, LOOK AT ME.
WE'RE FALLING BEHIND.

38:43.726 --> 38:45.520
<i>I NEED YOU EXPEDITING.</i>

38:45.520 --> 38:48.523
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL--YOU NEED
TO HANDLE THOSE TICKETS.

38:48.523 --> 38:50.233
WHY ARE THESE STILL HERE?

38:50.233 --> 38:52.068
<i>YOU'RE THE EXPEDITOR.</i>

38:54.946 --> 38:57.073
LISTEN,
YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN.

39:13.672 --> 39:15.299
IT'S RELAUNCH NIGHT
AT KATI ALLO.

39:15.299 --> 39:17.509
WHY ARE THESE STILL HERE?
YOU'RE THE EXPEDITOR.

39:17.509 --> 39:19.386
AND MANNY IS LEADING
THE KITCHEN,

39:19.386 --> 39:23.598
BUT AFTER A GOOD START, HE HAS
NOW LOST TRACK OF THE ORDERS.

39:26.601 --> 39:28.603
LISTEN,
YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN.

39:28.603 --> 39:32.065
AND DESPITE EVELYN'S ATTEMPT
TO GET HER FATHER FOCUSED...

39:34.484 --> 39:38.363
MANNY DECIDES NOW WOULD BE
A GOOD TIME TO TAKE A BREAK.

39:40.407 --> 39:40.723
OH, MAN.

39:40.723 --> 39:43.076
OH, MAN.

39:43.076 --> 39:45.078
ARE YOU WAITING
FOR ANYTHING?
I WAIT FOR 21.

39:45.078 --> 39:46.330
<i>I DON'T HAVE 21.</i>

39:46.330 --> 39:48.206
YOUR DADDY TELL YOU.
I'M NOT DADDY.

39:48.206 --> 39:50.667
<i>I DON'T HAVE</i>
<i>ANYTHING FOR YOU.</i>

39:50.667 --> 39:52.419
I HAD IT.

39:52.419 --> 39:55.797
I AM FRUSTRATED
BECAUSE THINGS START GOING WILD.

39:55.797 --> 39:57.716
BUT I WAS THINKING
ABOUT MY DAUGHTER.

39:57.716 --> 39:59.134
I WAS THINKING
ABOUT MY WIFE.

39:59.134 --> 40:02.179
SO I'M TRYING TO--
TO PULL EVERYTHING TOGETHER.

40:02.179 --> 40:03.221
<i>WHAT'S WRONG, MANNY?</i>

40:03.221 --> 40:04.598
YOU OKAY?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

40:04.598 --> 40:05.932
THIS IS A DISASTER.

40:05.932 --> 40:07.559
YOU'RE NOT
GONNA GIVE UP.

40:07.559 --> 40:09.561
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW--
IT'S CRAZY.
YEAH, I DO KNOW
HOW IT IS.

40:09.561 --> 40:10.723
I GET UPSET. WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.
WE HAVE TO STAY CALM.

40:10.723 --> 40:12.272
I GET UPSET. WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.
WE HAVE TO STAY CALM.

40:12.272 --> 40:14.649
WHAT TABLES GO NEXT?

40:16.276 --> 40:17.736
<i>OH, MY GOD.</i>

40:17.736 --> 40:20.072
MANNY, YOU HAVE TO TURN
AND SEND.

40:20.072 --> 40:21.698
WE GOT TO GET YOUR HEAD
OUT OF THE SAND.

40:21.698 --> 40:22.657
OPEN UP AND TALK.

40:22.657 --> 40:24.117
PLEASE. LET'S GO.

40:24.117 --> 40:26.161
<i>TABLE NUMBER THREE--</i>
<i>THE MOUSSAKA.</i>

40:26.161 --> 40:27.162
I NEED IT RIGHT NOW.

40:27.162 --> 40:28.872
<i>ALL RIGHT,</i>
<i>YOU SAID MOUSSAKA.</i>

40:28.872 --> 40:30.415
- MOUSSAKA YOU HAVE.
<i>- OKAY, GOOD.</i>

40:30.415 --> 40:31.792
NOW WE'RE IN CONTROL.
STAY IN CONTROL.

40:31.792 --> 40:33.168
YOU GOT IT.

40:33.168 --> 40:35.379
CHEF RAMSAY'S WORDS
PULLED ME BACK TOGETHER.

40:35.379 --> 40:38.298
FRIED CALAMARI'S READY?
YES.

40:38.298 --> 40:40.217
PICK IT UP FROM THERE--
THE SPINACH PIE, PLEASE.

40:40.217 --> 40:40.723
I PROMISED I WOULD BE
THE LEADER,

40:40.723 --> 40:41.593
I PROMISED I WOULD BE
THE LEADER,

40:41.593 --> 40:43.095
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

40:43.095 --> 40:45.138
CHRISTINA, I HAVE
A FLANK STEAK MEDIUM.

40:45.138 --> 40:46.223
<i>YES.</i>
CHICKEN KABOB,

40:46.223 --> 40:48.058
AND CHICKEN
SOUVLAKI SANDWICH.
<i>YES.</i>

40:50.310 --> 40:52.229
THAT IS GOOD.
FANTASTIC.

40:52.229 --> 40:53.897
HOW YOU DOING?
MY NAME'S MANNY.

40:53.897 --> 40:54.898
MANNY.
HOW ARE YOU?

40:54.898 --> 40:56.983
I'M THE OWNER OF THE PLACE.

40:56.983 --> 40:58.443
TWO LAMB, ONE SHRIMP,
ONE CHICKEN.

40:58.443 --> 41:00.237
<i>FIRE IT UP, GUYS.</i>
<i>WE'RE GOOD.</i>

41:00.237 --> 41:02.531
THIS IS THE LAST ONE.
BRING IT HOME NICE.

41:02.531 --> 41:05.117
THE SAME PASSION THAT MY FATHER
HAD WHEN HE FIRST OPENED

41:05.117 --> 41:07.160
THIS RESTAURANT--
IT'S BACK IN HIM NOW.

41:07.160 --> 41:09.037
THAT'S WHAT'S
REALLY IMPORTANT.

41:09.037 --> 41:10.723
YOU'RE PROUD
OF YOUR LITTLE GIRL?

41:10.723 --> 41:11.498
YOU'RE PROUD
OF YOUR LITTLE GIRL?

41:11.498 --> 41:13.458
OF COURSE.
OF COURSE.

41:13.458 --> 41:17.295
<i>WE ARE SO HAPPY.</i>
OPA!

41:17.295 --> 41:19.089
HOW YOU FEELING?

41:19.089 --> 41:20.924
GREAT. I'M SO HAPPY.

41:20.924 --> 41:22.592
<i>WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED HERE,</i>

41:22.592 --> 41:26.179
ONE THING I DIDN'T SEE
WAS ANY LOVE FOR EACH OTHER.

41:26.179 --> 41:28.390
TONIGHT, AND AMONGST
ALL THAT PRESSURE,

41:28.390 --> 41:30.892
<i>YOU STILL HAD RESPECT.</i>

41:30.892 --> 41:33.019
<i>YOU HAVE TO STAY</i>
<i>LIKE THAT.</i>

41:33.019 --> 41:35.230
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER,
SUPPORT EACH OTHER.

41:35.230 --> 41:36.314
YES.
YES.

41:36.314 --> 41:37.691
<i>RESPECT EACH OTHER.</i>
YES.

41:37.691 --> 41:40.723
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,
COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER.

41:40.723 --> 41:41.403
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,
COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER.

41:41.403 --> 41:42.904
TRUST ME, DO THAT,

41:42.904 --> 41:45.407
AND YOU'LL BE TOGETHER
FOR ANOTHER 35 YEARS.

41:45.407 --> 41:46.408
GOOD NIGHT.

41:46.408 --> 41:47.576
THANK YOU.
GOD BLESS YOU.

41:47.576 --> 41:49.703
BYE, GUYS.

41:49.703 --> 41:51.329
THIS, FOR ME, LET ME TELL YOU,

41:51.329 --> 41:52.747
HAS BEEN ONE
OF THE MOST DIFFICULT

41:52.747 --> 41:54.124
KITCHEN NIGHTMARES EVER.

41:54.124 --> 41:56.501
NOT ONLY WAS I WATCHING
A RESTAURANT IN SHAMBLES,

41:56.501 --> 41:58.295
BUT A MARRIAGE AS WELL.

41:58.295 --> 41:59.504
HOWEVER,
IN THE LAST COUPLE DAYS,

41:59.504 --> 42:01.923
BOTH MANNY AND CHRISTINA
SEEM TO BE HEADING

42:01.923 --> 42:03.091
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION--

42:03.091 --> 42:05.093
FIXING BOTH THE MARRIAGE
AND THE RESTAURANT.

42:05.093 --> 42:08.972
I STRONGLY BELIEVE
THEY'RE ON COURSE.

42:08.972 --> 42:10.723
LET'S KEEP IT THAT WAY.

42:10.723 --> 42:11.433
LET'S KEEP IT THAT WAY.

42:11.433 --> 42:12.893
WOW.

42:12.893 --> 42:16.688
WHO GETS A HAIRCUT AND BUYS
THE RESTAURANT NEXT DOOR?

42:18.356 --> 42:21.234
IN THE WEEKS THAT FOLLOWED...

42:21.234 --> 42:23.945
MANNY, I NEED THE APPETIZERS
FOR NUMBER 12.

42:23.945 --> 42:25.572
YES.
THANK YOU.

42:25.572 --> 42:28.992
MANNY AND CHRISTINA ARE BACK
WORKING TOGETHER IN HARMONY.

42:28.992 --> 42:31.077
AND THEIR MARRIAGE IS BETTER
THAN IT HAS BEEN IN YEARS.

42:31.077 --> 42:33.163
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

42:33.163 --> 42:35.248
AND WITH BUSINESS
CONTINUING TO IMPROVE...

42:35.248 --> 42:38.335
FIRE ME FOUR PITAS
AND CUT 'EM IN SIX, PLEASE.

42:38.335 --> 42:40.723
EVELYN HAS DECIDED TO WORK
FULL-TIME AT KATI ALLO.

42:40.723 --> 42:40.837
EVELYN HAS DECIDED TO WORK
FULL-TIME AT KATI ALLO.

42:40.837 --> 42:42.797
HUMMUS AT THE WINDOW, DAD.

42:42.797 --> 42:46.426
BEFORE CHEF RAMSAY CAME HERE,
WE HAD NO HOPE.

42:46.426 --> 42:48.136
EVERYBODY ENJOY YOUR FOOD.

42:48.136 --> 42:51.139
<i>OPA!</i>

42:51.139 --> 42:53.183
BUT HE DIDN'T ONLY SAVE
OUR RESTAURANT.

42:53.183 --> 42:56.228
HE SAVED OUR MARRIAGE,
OUR FAMILY.

42:56.228 --> 42:59.189
AND I REALLY APPRECIATE
WHAT HE DID.

42:59.189 --> 43:01.765
KATI ALLO IS REALLY
KATI ALLO.

43:01.765 --> 43:04.491
NOW MY PLACE--
IT'S REALLY SOMETHING ELSE.
