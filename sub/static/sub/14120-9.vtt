they're doing it on purpose.

00:37.038 --> 00:39.004
Hold on, Councilman.

00:39.006 --> 00:41.440
Are you saying the unions
are using the slowdown
as a bargaining tool?

00:41.442 --> 00:43.475
Well, it's hard to conclude
anything else.

00:43.477 --> 00:44.810
But we don't know.

00:44.812 --> 00:47.446
As I've said before,
it's a mystery.

00:47.448 --> 00:49.848
I propose we attempt
to solve the mystery

00:49.850 --> 00:52.084
by hiring an independent
mystery team

00:52.086 --> 00:57.156
and then have that
mystery team report
their findings back to us.

00:57.158 --> 00:59.024
Hmm. Now, that is interesting.

00:59.026 --> 01:02.294
I've heard very good things
about the Mike Tyson
Mystery Team.

01:02.296 --> 01:03.996

-Uh, yes.

01:03.998 --> 01:06.231
Although, I believe he's...
He's retired from boxing.

01:06.233 --> 01:10.402
All right.

Oh, (BLEEP), dude.

01:24.952 --> 01:27.019
Looks like some
of those religious people.

01:27.021 --> 01:29.755
You know, they go door to door
to prophesize.

-It basically says
you have 16 months

02:23.277 --> 02:26.879

02:26.881 --> 02:30.082
For this, we've budgeted
a total of $1.6 million,

02:30.084 --> 02:32.918
payable in monthly
installments of a $100,000.

02:32.920 --> 02:35.721

You want me to just go ahead

03:06.687 --> 03:08.620

it's been 16 months.

No, that feels too long.

If anything, it feels like
exactly a year and a quarter.

But, whatever it is,
it damn sure don't feel
like 16 months went by.

the city council or whoever
