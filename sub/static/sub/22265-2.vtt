Dagon has her toys.

00:06.040 --> 00:09.737
If anyone bothers a Prince of He//
you don ’t wanna know what happens.

00:11.520 --> 00:13.021
Crowley's dead. Kelly's dead.

00:13.480 --> 00:14.469
Cass is...

00:17.360 --> 00:18.349
Mom's gone.

00:19.880 --> 00:22.781
And apparently the Dev/7’s k/o’
hit puberty in 30 seconds ﬂat

00:22.880 --> 00:23.869
No!

Jack is not eV/i. He ’5 just
a

00:27.840 --> 00:30.422
My mother, she said the world
was a dangerous place.

00:30.560 --> 00:32.107
Thatis why] had to grow up fast.

00:32.320 --> 00:34.663
She said Casﬁei, he would keep me safe.

00:35.080 --> 00:36.707
5AM:
I think we should take him
back to the bunker.

00:36.800 --> 00:38.939
DEA/V:
I agree. Unt/if ﬁgure out
a
way to end him,

00:40.600 --> 00:41.589
we bring him home.

00:48.160 --> 00:50.219
Protecting the throne, Drexel?

00:50.920 --> 00:52.308
Face it; we ’re o’one.

01:01.320 --> 01:04.141
Lord Lucifer promised he would return.

01:04.840 --> 01:06.159
He'll pull us out of chaos.

01:06.840 --> 01:09.104
He will make Hell great again.

(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

01:15.000 --> 01:16.467
What did I tell you?

01:30.200 --> 01:31.588

01:34.320 --> 01:37.187
Um... Who'd you say you were?

01:37.280 --> 01:39.145
I am Asmodeus.

01:39.840 --> 01:40.977
Fourth Prince of Hell.

01:41.320 --> 01:44.699
Here to rule until such time
as Lucifer returns with his son.

01:46.080 --> 01:47.900
And there are gonna be some changes.

01:49.240 --> 01:52.300
The underperforming and ineffective,

01:53.120 --> 01:57.068
the corporate lackeys of the Crowley era
are being purged.

01:57.880 --> 02:01.304
The grand old days of
fire and brimstone are back.

02:03.120 --> 02:04.860
The following will step forward.

02:06.120 --> 02:07.109
Mr. Drexel.

02:10.240 --> 02:11.559
Mr. Harrington.

02:12.480 --> 02:13.549
Mr. Sierra.

02:18.080 --> 02:19.627
As for the rest of y'all...

02:23.280 --> 02:24.622
(BONES BREAKING)

02:27.680 --> 02:29.181
(SCREAMING)

02:41.680 --> 02:43.261
There's a new sheriff in town.

03:01.320 --> 03:04.187
Hey, we still got probably 12 hours
until we're home.

03:05.400 --> 03:06.389
You want me to drive?

03:06.880 --> 03:08.097
Do I ever want you to drive?

03:11.480 --> 03:15.109
Look, losing Mom and Cass,

03:16.840 --> 03:20.059
that's a lot to process, Dean,
especially on no sleep.

03:21.080 --> 03:22.547
- And the kid--
- The kid?

03:24.400 --> 03:25.901
Come on, man.
You know how this plays out.

03:27.960 --> 03:29.143
Look, when we try to bend the rules,

03:29.600 --> 03:32.979
pretend that the bad guys aren't so bad
or that things will get fixed,

03:33.640 --> 03:36.666
that's when people
that we care about get hurt.

03:37.160 --> 03:38.184
And then we end up doing
what we shou/d’ve o’one

03:38.320 --> 03:40.060
in the first place,
which is end the problem.

03:41.080 --> 03:43.583
So this time,
let's start with the obvious.

03:45.360 --> 03:47.737
Soon as I find a way to take care of it.

03:48.600 --> 03:53.219
Dean, the "problem" might be
our only shot at saving Mom.

03:59.320 --> 04:00.309
Mom's gone.

04:01.840 --> 04:02.829
There's no fixing that.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.187
LUCIFER: Mary, not to be critical,

04:18.320 --> 04:20.345
but if we are ever gonna
find a way out of here,

04:21.560 --> 04:23.221
you gotta pick up the pace.
(SNAPPING FINGERS)

04:23.320 --> 04:25.459
We got a lot of ground to cover, okay?

04:26.800 --> 04:28.188
Not sure I see the point,

04:28.920 --> 04:31.980
since no matter how this plays out,

04:33.640 --> 04:34.629
you're going to kill me.

04:35.440 --> 04:36.464
Why would I kill you?

04:39.280 --> 04:40.986
Oh, that's right. 'Cause I'm evil.

04:41.920 --> 04:43.740
Yeah, let me tell you
a couple things, all right?

04:43.840 --> 04:45.159
You don't get to defy God

04:45.240 --> 04:48.186
and beat the Cage without having
a modicum of intelligence,

04:48.480 --> 04:49.469
all right?

04:49.760 --> 04:54.060
A game plan, i.e., I don't want you dead
because I need you alive.

04:57.080 --> 04:58.980
All right look, yeah,
in a perfect wor/o;

05:00.000 --> 05:01.820
I would probably kill you
and your plodding sons.

05:01.920 --> 05:03.865
But life isn't fair.

05:04.360 --> 05:05.782
Your sons have my boy.

05:06.040 --> 05:09.259
So I'm gonna exchange you for my son.

05:12.440 --> 05:14.499
You can't possibly care about
raising a child.

05:15.480 --> 05:17.698
You have no idea what I care about.

05:18.600 --> 05:19.669
(DISTANT BOOMING)

05:40.880 --> 05:41.949
Mary?

05:46.240 --> 05:48.026
(SIGHS) No trace of Lucifer.

05:48.480 --> 05:49.469
Indeed.

05:49.760 --> 05:53.662
We scoured all of Hell.
Even checked the Cage. Nothing.

05:53.800 --> 05:56.064
At this point, we must focus on the son.

05:56.320 --> 05:57.708
There's no sign of him either, sir.

05:58.640 --> 06:01.985
- Maybe a sudden infant death?
- He is not an infant.

06:03.320 --> 06:04.457
New to this world, yes,

06:04.560 --> 06:08.337
but he is full of timeless knowledge
and unschooled power.

06:08.440 --> 06:10.305
He lives. I know it.

06:12.320 --> 06:15.699
With Lucifer gone,
I want him found and trained to rule.

06:16.400 --> 06:19.221
With me as his humble adviser,
of course.

06:20.000 --> 06:20.989
Okay.

06:21.320 --> 06:22.344
(CLEARS THROAT)

06:22.840 --> 06:28.346
Find son,
but continue to search for Lucifer.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.457
Because if we didn't, he'd be upset,

06:31.560 --> 06:35.826
and I can assure you,
from personal experience,

06:35.920 --> 06:40.141
that an upset Lucifer has a short fuse.

06:41.720 --> 06:42.709
(GROANING)

06:48.120 --> 06:50.224
Are you equating
your paltry acquaintance

06:50.320 --> 06:51.503
with our lord to mine?

06:52.920 --> 06:53.909
Mine,

06:54.400 --> 06:58.029
which is born from_ _
eons of serwce and sacrifice?

07:01.840 --> 07:03.182
(coueus)

07:04.280 --> 07:07.625
I know the perils
of Lucifer's disappointment.

07:10.360 --> 07:11.577
He... He did that?

07:12.880 --> 07:14.097
Long ago.

07:15.720 --> 07:18.462
Eager to please, I freed the Shedim.

07:19.080 --> 07:20.069
You...

07:20.440 --> 07:23.580
- Oh, I've heard stories about--
- Oh, I'm sure you have.

07:24.160 --> 07:25.548
Hell's most savage.

07:26.360 --> 07:30.945
Things so dark and base, God himself
would not allow them into the light.

07:31.760 --> 07:35.901
But I, in my pride,
believed that I could train them.

07:36.840 --> 07:37.943
Use them.

07:39.160 --> 07:42.266
But Lucifer feared them,
as well he should,

07:42.640 --> 07:43.857
so he forbade it,

07:44.680 --> 07:45.897
locked them up again.

07:47.120 --> 07:51.022
He was disappointed in me.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.417
The pain, the...

07:55.560 --> 07:57.380
The total humiliation,

07:58.080 --> 08:00.719
it forged an eternal bond between us.

I am his to command,

08:05.400 --> 08:06.583
as you are mine.

08:10.560 --> 08:11.549
Write that down.

08:15.240 --> 08:17.743
This is a bad idea.
We should've just kept driving.

08:18.080 --> 08:21.504
Dude, you were hallucinating sheep
on the road.

08:21.920 --> 08:23.057
We need a few hours.

08:33.040 --> 08:34.109
This is nice.

a
bite,

- Why don't--
- No, no.

Wait, wait, wait.
How old do you think you are?

10:08.840 --> 10:11.661
Three days, 17 hours, and 42 minutes.

10:30.480 --> 10:32.345
This book, it mentions my father.

10:32.960 --> 10:35.542
Not Castiel, but Lucifer.

10:36.040 --> 10:39.020
Oh, yeah. Yeah, he's big in the Bible.
Lot of screen time.

10:40.160 --> 10:41.502
And you knew him?

10:42.280 --> 10:45.659
Well, he's not really
an easy guy to know. He's...

10:46.320 --> 10:47.389
He's kind of rough around the edges.

10:48.800 --> 10:49.789
He's Satan.

10:51.120 --> 10:53.463
And that's... That's bad.

10:53.640 --> 10:54.629
Damn straight.

10:55.800 --> 10:56.789
See,

10:57.640 --> 10:59.380
he turned on his father, God.

10:59.880 --> 11:01.461
God. He's in here, too.

11:02.280 --> 11:03.463
Is he famous or something?

11:05.000 --> 11:10.267
Yeah. God basically created everything.

11:10.640 --> 11:11.664
DEA/V: Yeah, and then he sk/ppeo’ out

11:11.760 --> 11:14.399
leaving guys like us
to clean up his messes like Lucifer.

11:15.160 --> 11:17.822
SO God's like my grandfather.

11:18.120 --> 11:19.747
He's family, and that's...

11:21.320 --> 11:22.309
That's good.

11:22.520 --> 11:23.509

11:26.680 --> 11:27.942

say you wanted to
be someplace else right now.

15:36.200 --> 15:37.667
Archangel, actually.

15:39.080 --> 15:40.820
- Lucifer.
- Lucifer?

15:41.520 --> 15:43.181
5AM:
And Donazg’i/o here is
prophet.

15:43.280 --> 15:45.657
Which means he has a direct line
to God, or Heaven.

15:46.160 --> 15:49.618
DONATELLO: Yes, well,
not so much anymore. But...

15:49.920 --> 15:50.909
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

15:52.840 --> 15:53.829
Look at you.

15:56.160 --> 15:57.627
The waves of power,

15:58.960 --> 15:59.949
so intense.

16:00.080 --> 16:01.399
Maybe less human than we thought.

16:02.080 --> 16:03.183
DO/VA TELL 0: Fasc/nat/ng.

16:04.840 --> 16:05.864
You know, I've met your father.

16:06.560 --> 16:09.427
Your power's nothing like his.
Not dark, not toxic.

16:10.320 --> 16:11.981
- That so?
- Not yet.

16:13.080 --> 16:14.661
If Jack is sending out
a signal strong enough

16:14.760 --> 16:16.421
to get Donatello all the way out here,

16:17.400 --> 16:18.617
the angels are still out there.

16:18.880 --> 16:20.507
I mean, who knows
what else m/ght be listen/ng?

16:21.360 --> 16:22.349
He needs protection.

16:24.960 --> 16:26.382
SAM: All right, so,

16:27.360 --> 16:28.679
I'm thinking something like this,

16:29.160 --> 16:30.149
right about here.

16:30.680 --> 16:32.705
You know what? Exactly like that.

16:33.840 --> 16:36.183
- And you're cool with this?
- Yeah.

16:36.440 --> 16:37.828
Turn the damn thing on
and start buzzin'.

16:38.960 --> 16:41.940
(STAMMERING) We're brothers.
It's kind of like a family crest.

16:47.720 --> 16:50.302
SO you heard Donatello.
NO evil vibes from Jack.

16:51.680 --> 16:52.669
Proves nothing,

16:53.600 --> 16:55.500
except that you're
way too attached to this kid.

16:56.040 --> 16:57.940
You need to see this
for what it is, Okay?

16:58.480 --> 16:59.549
I mean, what do you need, a sign?

17:00.280 --> 17:03.829
Dean, whatever his powers are
or will be,

17:04.480 --> 17:06.983
if we train him properly,
they could be used for good.

17:09.040 --> 17:10.177
(THUDS)

17:12.120 --> 17:13.109
Well, there's your sign.

17:13.720 --> 17:16.029
- Did you do that?
- I'm not sure.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.301
Hey. You all right?

17:20.360 --> 17:21.349
It hurt.

17:22.760 --> 17:24.660
Okay, see, sometimes, things hurt,

17:24.880 --> 17:27.223
so you just man up and deal with it.

17:29.160 --> 17:30.377
Yes. I understand.

17:30.960 --> 17:32.905
Pain is a part of
the complete human experience.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.581
Accepting it is a sign of maturity.

17:35.880 --> 17:36.869
All right.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.104
I think your machine
might've fritzed out there.

17:39.200 --> 17:40.269
You might wanna get that looked at.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.024
Yeah.

17:49.080 --> 17:50.069
(NEEDLE BUZZING)

17:53.280 --> 17:54.269
Okey-dokey.

18:02.920 --> 18:03.909
Looks good, Jack.

18:16.040 --> 18:17.382
Well, there's your second sign.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.625
SAM: It was a reflex.
He didn't do it on purpose.

18:35.760 --> 18:37.739
DEAN: Who cares if he didn't do it
on purpose? He did it.

18:38.080 --> 18:39.502
I mean, you didn't see
Cass smiting someone

18:39.600 --> 18:40.783
every time he got his teeth cleaned.

18:40.880 --> 18:41.869
I'm right here, you know.

18:41.960 --> 18:43.461
Yeah, and what about
the vanishing tattoo?

18:43.720 --> 18:45.267
An archangel healing itself.

18:45.360 --> 18:47.499
- SAM: Another reflex.
- Or maybe he didn't want to be warded.

18:48.080 --> 18:50.059
Okay, look, yeah,
Jack is on Lucifer's family tree.

18:50.160 --> 18:51.900
But we don't know if that DNA
is stronger than Kelly's,

18:52.000 --> 18:52.989
or his connection with Cass.

18:53.240 --> 18:54.741
Oh, you mean the connection
that got Cass killed?

18:55.120 --> 18:56.860
I'm just saying,
Jack doesn't have to be evil.

18:57.440 --> 18:58.657
We can teach him not to be.

18:58.760 --> 19:00.227
-(CHUCKLES)
- Ah...

19:00.320 --> 19:02.663
- The nature versu|s_| nurture conundrum.
- ey.

19:02.840 --> 19:03.829
Dude.

19:05.920 --> 19:08.263
Speaking not as a prophet
but as a scientist,

19:09.000 --> 19:11.503
I don't think teaching him
is in the cards.

19:12.720 --> 19:14.585
It's like asking a lion
not to be a lion.

19:14.680 --> 19:16.420
But this isn't a lion! This is a human!

19:16.680 --> 19:18.420
With a strong dose of God juice.

19:18.600 --> 19:20.067
DEA/V’C Okay. That’s it.
I ’m done, a// right?

19:20.160 --> 19:22.799
'Cause he's not God, he's not Cass,
he's not Simba.

19:22.880 --> 19:23.869
He's the friggin' Devil!

19:25.720 --> 19:26.709
Jack?

19:26.920 --> 19:28.057
DEAN: Uh-Oh.

19:35.360 --> 19:37.066
KEIL Y: I /0 ve you, Jack.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.699
I love you so much.

19:44.120 --> 19:46.224
You are gonna be amazing.

19:46.920 --> 19:49.377
5AM: Jack? Jack?

19:54.040 --> 19:55.029
Hey.

19:56.680 --> 19:59.547
Hey, bud. We, uh...
We've been looking for you.

20:03.200 --> 20:04.462
I'm sorry. I...

20:07.600 --> 20:09.181
Everyone was so angry.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.222
Yeah, and, uh,

20:15.000 --> 20:17.025
I suppose you wanted to be away from it.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.427
And suddenly, I was.

20:26.760 --> 20:27.749
I'll tell you what.

20:28.920 --> 20:30.501
You got some special skills, Jack.

20:31.240 --> 20:32.229
That's for sure.

20:33.920 --> 20:36.104
We just need to make sure
we get a grip on 'em, so...

20:37.600 --> 20:38.703
SO you don't hurt anybody.

20:42.360 --> 20:43.907
Is that why Dean hates me?

20:44.400 --> 20:45.867
Dean doesn't hate you.

20:48.920 --> 20:53.107
Look, sometimes the wires in Dean's head
get crossed and he gets frustrated,

20:53.200 --> 20:56.704
and then he mixes frustration
wrth anger, and fear.

20:58.680 --> 20:59.999
Why would he be afraid?

21:02.200 --> 21:04.862
Because Dean feels like it's his job
to protect everyone.

21:06.840 --> 21:09.946
And right now, we need to protect you.

21:12.080 --> 21:16.107
But we also may need to protect
people from you.

21:23.280 --> 21:24.827
Maybe I'm not worth all this.

21:27.520 --> 21:28.623
Your mom thought you were.

21:29.760 --> 21:30.749
SO did Cass.

21:32.720 --> 21:33.709
SO do I.

21:38.920 --> 21:40.706
(COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING)

21:44.960 --> 21:45.949
Get you another?

21:47.440 --> 21:48.429
Yeah. Sure.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.306
What the hell?
You're not drivin', right?

21:50.720 --> 21:52.506
I've just... I've seen you
around the hotel.

21:52.960 --> 21:54.621
Passin' through with what, your buddies?

21:55.000 --> 21:58.424
Oh, that's my brother,
and some messed-up kid.

21:58.920 --> 22:00.103
Oh, the kid's messed up?

22:01.360 --> 22:02.782
Yeah, issues with his dad.

22:03.400 --> 22:04.389
The older fella.

22:05.560 --> 22:07.107
NO, that's Donatello.

22:07.600 --> 22:09.659
He's a guy we work with.

22:10.880 --> 22:12.017
I hated my old man.

22:12.440 --> 22:15.022
I ran away myself.
See, my mom would never stick up for me.

22:15.400 --> 22:17.265
But you know kids.

22:17.360 --> 22:19.863
NO matter what,
they still want the Old man's approval.

22:20.200 --> 22:21.667
Well, that's how it was for me, just...

22:22.280 --> 22:23.304
Yeah, no, that's...

22:24.680 --> 22:25.669
That's how it was with me, too.

22:26.480 --> 22:28.857
I'm talkin' your ear off,
I'll grab you that drink.

22:29.040 --> 22:31.258
You know what? I'm good.
I'm gonna take a walk.

22:31.840 --> 22:32.829
Okay.

22:35.880 --> 22:37.586
- There you go. Thank you.
- Thanks.

22:46.680 --> 22:47.749
(DOOR CLOSES)

22:53.360 --> 22:54.429

23:03.360 --> 23:04.384
Come in.

23:06.200 --> 23:07.383
- Hey.
- Hi.

23:08.240 --> 23:09.229
Good morning.

23:09.880 --> 23:10.869
How's Jack?

23:11.920 --> 23:14.559
By the way, sorry to stick him with you.

23:14.960 --> 23:17.463
Things got a little tense here
last night,

23:17.560 --> 23:20.199
so I figured it'd be better to
have him stay in your room.

23:21.480 --> 23:23.698
It's not a big deal.
He's an interesting kid.

23:24.600 --> 23:26.818
Yeah. Yeah, that's an understatement.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.224
Let me ask you.

23:31.720 --> 23:35.224
DO you have any idea
how powerful he'll get to be?

23:38.200 --> 23:40.339
Uh, I don't. NO.

23:41.080 --> 23:44.777
But the lore says, quote,

23:45.720 --> 23:49.383
"A Nephilim becomes more powerful
than the angel who sired it."

23:49.560 --> 23:52.905
And in this case,
the sire is an archangel. SO...

23:55.640 --> 23:56.959
Does he know about his father?

23:59.080 --> 24:00.069
Vaguely.

24:00.600 --> 24:04.229
SO he's not bonded to Lucifer.

24:04.400 --> 24:06.425
He seems to have a real attachment
to his mom,

24:06.560 --> 24:09.859
but only kind of a fuzzy idea
about his dad.

24:10.400 --> 24:12.903
And his mom, Kelly,
was a really good person,

24:13.040 --> 24:15.258
so that makes me think
Jack can be molded the right way.

24:16.760 --> 24:17.943
Oh, molded. (CHUCKLES)

24:18.960 --> 24:20.063

We are gonna be on the road
a long time today. Right?

Yeah. Well, you know,
we don't have to be

back to the bunker like that.

if you and I are gonna do this,

27:18.640 --> 27:22.064
keep Jack on the right side of things,
then we have to be on the same page.

27:22.520 --> 27:23.942
Okay. Well,
that's the problem, though, Sam,

27:24.040 --> 27:26.383
'cause we're not on
the same page. Like, at all.

27:29.400 --> 27:30.389
All right.

what's going on here?

and Cass is gone,

we've gone through...

28:54.920 --> 28:57.229
- A shifter?
- What would a shifter want with Jack?

29:03.560 --> 29:04.549
Where you going, cowboy?

29:05.760 --> 29:07.102
He went this way.

29:07.640 --> 29:08.629
You sure?

29:09.480 --> 29:10.469
I can feel it.

29:11.120 --> 29:12.109
I'll get the gear.

30:56.320 --> 30:59.585
As a prophet, Jack,
I speak the words of God.

31:00.240 --> 31:01.229
DO you know who God is?

31:02.440 --> 31:04.419
Yes. Kind of.

31:06.480 --> 31:09.347
Well, son, God has a message for you.

31:10.400 --> 31:12.220
You must prepare yourself, Jack.

31:13.040 --> 31:15.383
Train yourself to use your gifts,

31:16.080 --> 31:17.422
to fulfill your destiny.

31:18.840 --> 31:19.829
H ow?

31:22.480 --> 31:23.469
Long aQO,

31:24.000 --> 31:26.059
a troop of God's bravest soldiers

31:26.320 --> 31:29.380
were trapped in
a distant cavern of a place called Hell.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.319
I've read about Hell.

31:32.240 --> 31:33.309
It doesn't sound nice.

31:33.520 --> 31:34.509
It's not.

31:34.720 --> 31:36.426
That's why we have to
rescue the soldiers.

31:37.640 --> 31:39.346
They're called the Shedim,

31:40.280 --> 31:42.919
and God wants you to set them free,

31:43.520 --> 31:44.509
to be a hero.

31:46.280 --> 31:47.304
I could do that?

31:47.640 --> 31:49.744
That, and so much more.

31:52.520 --> 31:54.147
You see that patch of earth there?

31:55.080 --> 31:57.184
Imagine the force Of your will,

31:57.680 --> 32:00.137
drilling down into infinite darkness,

32:00.480 --> 32:02.425
the soldiers being drawn to the surface.

32:02.880 --> 32:03.869
Do it Jack!

- I'm trying.

32:26.920 --> 32:27.909

32:28.600 --> 32:31.057

alongside Jack's.

the closer we get to it.

32:34.920 --> 32:37.059

- Maybe it's an angel.

32:37.160 --> 32:38.229
NO. Something dark.

32:40.720 --> 32:42.062
DO you ever have any good news?

32:42.960 --> 32:45.064
All right, well, see if there's
anything in Jasper that's demon-y.

32:46.200 --> 32:47.189
Yeah, there is.

32:47.400 --> 32:50.824
According to Dad's journal, Jasper
is home to its very own gate to Hell.

32:51.680 --> 32:53.386
- It gets better.
- Fantastic.

32:53.480 --> 32:56.460
According to legend,
this particular gate leads to, quote,

32:57.280 --> 32:58.941
"A place where unimaginable evil

32:59.320 --> 33:02.107
"emanates from creatures too wicked
for the pit to hold."

33:02.560 --> 33:03.549

we gotta blow this taco stand

33:20.080 --> 33:22.025
before who knows what happens to my son.

33:22.200 --> 33:23.189
And second of all,

33:23.880 --> 33:25.427
you're the reason that we are even stuck

33:25.520 --> 33:27.579
in this literally godforsaken place
to begin with.

33:27.680 --> 33:28.942
SO I'm sorry you're tired.

33:29.640 --> 33:30.857
It's not my fault you were born

33:31.480 --> 33:33.027

with your wimpy little lungs

33:33.120 --> 33:34.303
and your weak little legs.

33:36.080 --> 33:37.468
- What?
- You heard me.

33:37.920 --> 33:39.660
Don't say another word
on this trip, okay?
