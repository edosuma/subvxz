01:52.895 --> 01:54.114
- It's fantastic.

01:55.898 --> 01:58.248
- Yeah, I don't know if
it's such a good idea.

01:58.292 --> 02:00.511
Maybe we shouldn't be here.

02:02.774 --> 02:04.559
- It's gonna be fine.

02:04.602 --> 02:05.386
Come on.

02:10.651 --> 02:12.175
You want a drink?

02:13.002 --> 02:14.482
- Uh, yeah.

02:29.540 --> 02:30.324
- Relax.

02:31.934 --> 02:35.894
If we get in trouble it's
because we're both here.

02:35.938 --> 02:38.201
It'll be our little secret.

02:48.951 --> 02:50.909
Let's make it memorable.

02:54.826 --> 02:55.566
Sit.

03:00.267 --> 03:02.225
Ready to play?

03:10.320 --> 03:12.975
- Why do you like
these things so much?

03:13.018 --> 03:14.759
- I don't know.

03:14.803 --> 03:16.805
I just want to see
what's out there.

03:16.848 --> 03:17.632
Don't you?

03:19.895 --> 03:21.026
- I guess so.

03:23.768 --> 03:26.728
- Here you guys are!

03:26.771 --> 03:28.164
- Claire, you made it.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.818
- Wouldn't miss
this for the world.

03:29.861 --> 03:31.907
So you're really
gonna do this, huh?

03:31.950 --> 03:32.690
- Yep.

03:32.734 --> 03:34.257
- Oh, my God.

03:34.301 --> 03:35.215
This is crazy.

03:37.129 --> 03:39.828
What type of sexual
favor did she offer you

03:39.871 --> 03:41.438
to get in here, hmm?

03:42.483 --> 03:43.266
- Shut up.

03:43.310 --> 03:44.572
Don't listen to her.

03:44.615 --> 03:46.356
- Always listen to me.

03:47.357 --> 03:48.967
So, what do we do?

03:52.101 --> 03:54.712
- All right, first we have to ask
the spirit world to come in here.

03:54.756 --> 03:57.585
But, let me give you a little
background about this house.

03:57.628 --> 04:00.979
Rumors have it that
a long time ago

04:01.023 --> 04:04.200
people were murdered, tortured,

04:04.244 --> 04:06.550
they went missing here.

04:06.594 --> 04:10.162
They say the spirits
still haunt this house

04:10.206 --> 04:13.427
so we're gonna try to
call them in right now.

04:13.470 --> 04:15.298
Put your hands on here.

04:18.954 --> 04:21.478
Then you're gonna focus.

04:21.522 --> 04:25.177
Now we need to ask permission
for the spirits to talk.

04:27.354 --> 04:30.313
Will you please speak
with us, spirits?

04:32.446 --> 04:35.144
Is there a spirit in this room?

04:41.237 --> 04:42.673
- Maybe we should
just call it a night.

04:42.717 --> 04:45.110
I don't think it's working.

04:45.154 --> 04:47.287
- This is crazy.
- Wait, just give it a second, come on.

04:47.330 --> 04:48.331
Focus.

04:49.376 --> 04:50.290
- Yeah, focus.

04:51.726 --> 04:55.120
- If you're here,
please show us a sign.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.046
- Jesus!

05:08.090 --> 05:08.873
What?

05:13.704 --> 05:14.488
What?

05:16.577 --> 05:17.447
I can't, let's just,

05:17.491 --> 05:18.883
get, get rid of this thing.

05:18.927 --> 05:20.189
Let's take your cute
little boyfriend

05:20.232 --> 05:21.364
and we'll go to the
bar like normal people

05:21.408 --> 05:22.800
and just have drinks.

05:22.844 --> 05:23.714
Cool?

05:39.817 --> 05:40.601
- Tomas!

05:54.397 --> 05:55.180
Claire?

05:57.095 --> 05:58.880
Claire, where are you?

06:10.631 --> 06:12.328
Where are you guys?

06:15.549 --> 06:16.550
Tomas?

07:06.164 --> 07:09.341
- I'm sorry but you got
three weeks to vacate.

07:09.385 --> 07:11.735
That's what happens when
you don't pay your mortgage.

07:11.779 --> 07:13.302
- I'm so sorry, ma'am.

07:13.345 --> 07:14.608
We wish you all the best

07:14.651 --> 07:17.654
and hope you can get
back on your feet.

07:25.575 --> 07:26.881
- Hi, Mom.

07:26.924 --> 07:28.665
I brought boxes.

07:28.709 --> 07:32.277
- Should've brought
one I can fit inside.

07:32.321 --> 07:33.104
- Mom.

07:42.592 --> 07:43.898
Mom, really, I don't want you

07:43.941 --> 07:45.682
to worry about this
any more, okay?

07:45.726 --> 07:47.989
As soon as I finish my
thesis we'll publish the book

07:48.032 --> 07:50.165
and then I'll buy
you this house back

07:50.208 --> 07:53.385
or we can get you another one.

07:53.429 --> 07:56.519
- This house has been in my
family for over a hundred years.

07:56.563 --> 07:59.304
Why would I want another one?

07:59.348 --> 08:01.916
- I'm sure you'd like
it once you got there.

08:01.959 --> 08:04.092
- What I'd like is for you
to pay off your student loans

08:04.135 --> 08:06.573
and get out of debt so
that nothing like this

08:06.616 --> 08:08.444
ever happens to you.

08:09.663 --> 08:11.578
That's what I would like.

08:11.621 --> 08:13.580
Not you studying demons.

08:14.711 --> 08:16.234
- I don't study demons.

08:16.278 --> 08:17.714
We've been through this, Mom.

08:17.758 --> 08:20.848
I study paranormal phenomenon
as they relate to science.

08:20.891 --> 08:24.112
I know things happen but
it's not because of demons.

08:24.155 --> 08:25.766
It's just what
I'm interested in.

08:25.809 --> 08:29.813
- Well, it doesn't
matter whether it's science.

08:29.857 --> 08:31.598
There are some things

08:31.641 --> 08:34.557
that people just
shouldn't mess with.

08:34.601 --> 08:35.732
- Well, I'm sure you'll be
singing a different tune

08:35.775 --> 08:37.647
when you see how
well my book sells.

08:37.691 --> 08:41.172
My publisher has
really high hopes.

08:41.216 --> 08:42.826
- Your publisher, huh?

08:42.870 --> 08:44.131
- Yeah.

08:44.174 --> 08:47.483
- Do kids your age even
read books anymore?

08:47.527 --> 08:48.397
- Sure.

08:48.440 --> 08:50.791
If it's on a Kindle.

08:53.837 --> 08:54.969
- Oh, my...
- Mom!

08:55.012 --> 08:55.752
Hey, hey, hey!

08:55.796 --> 08:56.666
I got it.

08:56.710 --> 08:57.667
- It's heavy.

08:57.711 --> 08:59.103
- I know, I got it.

09:00.670 --> 09:02.280
You know what would
be really great though

09:02.324 --> 09:07.111
is if I could go spend the
weekend at the old cabin.

09:07.155 --> 09:10.027
- I told you never
to go up there.

09:10.071 --> 09:11.638
- It's just for research.

09:11.681 --> 09:13.291
It's not like you honestly
believe those stories.

09:13.335 --> 09:15.729
- It doesn't matter
what I believe.

09:15.772 --> 09:17.121
That house belongs to your aunt.

09:17.165 --> 09:19.776
You have no business
going there.

09:23.824 --> 09:26.435
- Well, will you at least
tell me the real story?

09:26.478 --> 09:28.219
- Nothing to tell.

09:28.263 --> 09:30.787
- That's not what Samantha said.

09:34.574 --> 09:38.534
- There's a reason we
don't talk to your cousin.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.145
I don't want you
trying to go there

09:41.189 --> 09:44.105
or speaking to anybody on that
side of the family about it.

09:44.148 --> 09:45.889
Do you understand?

09:47.761 --> 09:49.632
- Knock, knock.

09:49.676 --> 09:50.590
Hello.

09:50.633 --> 09:52.156
Here to help.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.070
Ms. Fields.

10:07.911 --> 10:10.697
So, what does your mom think
about us using the house?

10:10.740 --> 10:12.742
- I'd say she's not a fan.

10:12.786 --> 10:14.396
- Great.

10:14.439 --> 10:16.137
- Well, what she doesn't
know won't hurt her

10:16.180 --> 10:18.008
and besides she
doesn't need to know

10:18.052 --> 10:20.184
that we're going there to
do witchcraft experiments

10:20.228 --> 10:21.925
with our friends.

10:21.969 --> 10:23.753
- Wait, um, friends?

10:26.582 --> 10:27.801
- Yeah.

10:27.844 --> 10:30.325
I invited Spence and Tina.

10:30.368 --> 10:33.154
- You did what?

10:33.197 --> 10:36.766
- I thought it might be nice
to have some extra observers.

10:36.810 --> 10:40.030
- But, what about
Tina and the whole...

10:44.818 --> 10:45.732
- Maybe I thought
it would be nice

10:45.775 --> 10:47.734
to scare her a little bit.

10:49.561 --> 10:51.781
- You, you.

11:02.574 --> 11:04.272
So, Spence, this is
the new beast, huh?

11:05.403 --> 11:06.970
- This is my baby.

11:07.014 --> 11:08.145
Sorry, honey.

11:08.189 --> 11:10.365
You're my close runner up.

11:11.845 --> 11:16.240
So, Laurie, what exactly
happened at your aunt's house?

11:16.284 --> 11:17.807
- Some pretty weird
shit apparently.

11:17.851 --> 11:19.722
I mean, I don't really
know much, honestly.

11:19.766 --> 11:22.203
It's just really hush, hush.

11:22.246 --> 11:23.595
- That's so much better.

11:23.639 --> 11:25.728
I love undisturbed places.

11:25.772 --> 11:28.426
- Oh, this place is
plenty disturbed.

11:28.470 --> 11:30.341
Or at least disturbing.

11:31.952 --> 11:34.389
- What do you know about it?

11:34.432 --> 11:35.956
- Well, my cousin's
the one that told me

11:35.999 --> 11:37.958
about all the witchcraft stuff.

11:38.001 --> 11:40.177
She's the one that's
getting us in the place.

11:40.221 --> 11:42.136
- Wait, witchcraft?

11:42.179 --> 11:43.964
- Don't worry, man.

11:44.007 --> 11:46.401
Laurie's ancestors
were good witches.

11:46.444 --> 11:48.142
Nature witches.

11:48.185 --> 11:49.621
- Witches, huh?

11:49.665 --> 11:50.840
Cool.

12:00.894 --> 12:01.721
- Thanks.

12:01.764 --> 12:02.809
- No problem.

12:11.905 --> 12:14.821
- Spence says this
trip is for research?

12:14.864 --> 12:16.866
- Yeah, it's actually
for my thesis.

12:16.910 --> 12:18.650
I have a book deal lined
up as soon as I finish

12:18.694 --> 12:20.043
the final chapter.

12:20.087 --> 12:21.741
- That's so impressive.

12:21.784 --> 12:22.916
- Thank you.

12:22.959 --> 12:24.918
My publisher is pretty excited.

12:24.961 --> 12:28.225
- Oh, this isn't self-published?

12:28.269 --> 12:29.052
- No.

12:34.405 --> 12:36.451
- How did you find a publisher?

12:36.494 --> 12:37.931
- Well, actually he found me.

12:37.974 --> 12:40.847
I think it was through
the school or something.

12:40.890 --> 12:42.065
- Did you tell Spence and Tina

12:42.109 --> 12:44.851
what we're actually
gonna be doing there?

12:44.894 --> 12:45.634
- No.

12:45.677 --> 12:46.417
I didn't wanna spoil it.

12:46.461 --> 12:48.202
- Oh, that is mean.

12:48.245 --> 12:49.029
- What?

12:49.072 --> 12:49.899
What is it?

12:51.596 --> 12:52.989
- Oh, we're just wanted to
do a couple tests up there

12:53.033 --> 12:54.208
and I wanted to do it in a place

12:54.251 --> 12:57.385
that has a real
history of dark magic.

12:58.821 --> 13:00.301
- You're being so mean.

13:00.344 --> 13:01.432
She's totally underselling
this right now.

13:01.476 --> 13:02.520
- Nick.

13:02.564 --> 13:03.783
- All right.

13:03.826 --> 13:06.437
There's stories about a
cult sacrificing babies

13:06.481 --> 13:08.004
at this place and shit.

13:08.048 --> 13:09.136
- Oh, my God.

13:09.179 --> 13:10.441
That's messed up.

13:10.485 --> 13:12.792
- No, it's, it's not
a cult, it's a coven.

13:12.835 --> 13:14.576
- Whatever.

13:14.619 --> 13:16.012
Somebody killed
a bunch of babies

13:16.056 --> 13:18.449
and we're gonna go
sleep at this place.

13:18.493 --> 13:19.929
- Wait, I
thought you all said

13:19.973 --> 13:21.975
these were good witches.

13:22.018 --> 13:23.237
- If you keep doing this

13:23.280 --> 13:25.021
nobody's gonna wanna
go on the trip.

13:25.065 --> 13:27.067
- Well, it's too late now.

13:27.110 --> 13:32.681
We're three quarters of the
way to Dead Babies 'R' Us.

13:32.724 --> 13:34.770
- You're such a dumbass.

13:36.206 --> 13:37.860
It's gonna be fine.

13:43.474 --> 13:45.650
- That is so crazy.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.480
Honey, you're being
awfully quiet.

13:49.524 --> 13:50.917
- I mean, come on.

13:50.960 --> 13:53.180
Doesn't the thought of going
to this place bother you?

13:53.223 --> 13:54.616
- It'll be fine.

14:03.712 --> 14:04.495
Babe.

14:09.022 --> 14:10.066
- Don't say I didn't warn you.

14:41.750 --> 14:42.882
- So this is it.

14:47.277 --> 14:49.410
- Hey, it doesn't look that bad.

14:49.453 --> 14:51.020
- Well, yeah, they
fixed it up over the years.

14:51.064 --> 14:52.761
They lived here
from time to time.

14:52.804 --> 14:54.241
- And we have cell service.

14:54.284 --> 14:55.938
Nice.

15:14.391 --> 15:15.262
- You guys wait here.

15:15.305 --> 15:17.046
I'm gonna check around back.

15:17.090 --> 15:21.442
- Oh, great, we're already
wandering off by ourselves.

15:21.485 --> 15:22.704
- You made it!

15:23.531 --> 15:24.880
- You are here!

15:26.186 --> 15:28.144
- Just arrived.

15:28.188 --> 15:29.493
My love, how are you?

15:29.537 --> 15:30.842
- I'm good.

15:30.886 --> 15:33.062
You guys, this is
my cousin, Samantha.

15:33.106 --> 15:35.978
It's Spence, Tina and
my boyfriend, Nick.

15:36.022 --> 15:38.067
- Okay, Spence, Tina, Nick.

15:38.111 --> 15:39.721
It's nice to meet
all of you guys.

15:39.764 --> 15:41.114
Welcome.

15:41.157 --> 15:43.377
You guys are gonna freak
out when you see this place.

15:43.420 --> 15:44.204
Come.

15:44.247 --> 15:44.987
Come!

15:49.122 --> 15:49.905
- Oh.

15:51.472 --> 15:53.082
Ah, a work call.

15:53.126 --> 15:54.040
I gotta take this one.

15:54.083 --> 15:55.084
- Okay.

15:55.128 --> 15:55.911
- Yep.

15:57.913 --> 15:59.393
Yeah, it's Spencer.

16:02.178 --> 16:03.353
- Holy smokes.

16:05.138 --> 16:06.966
- Nothing too scary
right off the bat

16:07.009 --> 16:08.924
but if you look around

16:08.968 --> 16:11.971
you'll start to notice
stuff like this.

16:21.023 --> 16:23.634
- That's interesting.

16:24.635 --> 16:25.985
- Look, pet rocks.

16:27.203 --> 16:30.380
- The coven used these
in their rituals.

16:30.424 --> 16:31.991
Look what I found.

16:33.470 --> 16:34.689
- Hey, do you mind if I film?

16:34.732 --> 16:36.125
Laurie might use this
for her research.

16:36.169 --> 16:38.258
- Oh, no, knock yourself out.

16:38.301 --> 16:39.781
- Excellent.

16:39.824 --> 16:40.608
- Okay.

16:51.793 --> 16:53.882
Our great aunt was a witch.

16:53.925 --> 16:54.926
- They know.

16:54.970 --> 16:56.493
- Oh, good.

16:56.537 --> 16:59.192
It's usually best to get
that out of the way first.

17:01.498 --> 17:04.240
Why don't I show
you to your room?

17:05.633 --> 17:07.200
- This is some crazy stuff.

17:07.242 --> 17:09.244
- This is really cool.

17:22.867 --> 17:26.175
- It's pretty,
pretty creepy, huh?

17:26.219 --> 17:27.002
- Hmm.

17:30.310 --> 17:33.095
- I think you guys will
be happiest in this room.

17:33.139 --> 17:34.444
It's the least haunted, anyway.

17:34.488 --> 17:36.055
- Oh, good.

17:36.098 --> 17:37.578
We don't want our
heads spinning around.

17:37.621 --> 17:40.276
- No, that's terrible
for your neck and spine.

17:40.320 --> 17:41.234
Let me know if
you need anything.

17:41.277 --> 17:42.235
- Thank you.

18:01.167 --> 18:03.082
- Are these the witches?

18:03.125 --> 18:05.214
Or just scary-looking women?

18:06.476 --> 18:08.130
- That's just how
women look naturally.

18:09.305 --> 18:11.786
- Well, I'm not
disagreeing with that.

18:11.829 --> 18:15.137
- Well, I hope you
don't get eaten by one.

18:19.576 --> 18:20.360
- Hey.

18:20.403 --> 18:21.274
Where's Tina?

18:21.317 --> 18:22.231
- Oh, I think she went upstairs.

18:22.275 --> 18:23.145
- Okay.

18:23.189 --> 18:24.538
Nice of you.
- Yeah.

18:35.853 --> 18:36.593
- Honey.

18:39.422 --> 18:40.162
Honey.

18:44.514 --> 18:45.298
Honey.

18:45.341 --> 18:47.604
- Huh?

18:47.648 --> 18:48.431
Oh, sorry.

18:50.868 --> 18:53.871
- Don't tell me you're gonna
let a little doll spook you?

18:53.915 --> 18:56.918
Even though it is
creepy as hell.

18:56.961 --> 18:59.268
- It's not just the doll.

19:00.226 --> 19:02.445
It smells like something died.

19:02.489 --> 19:03.316
- It's an old house.

19:03.359 --> 19:05.535
A lot of things died.

19:05.579 --> 19:07.407
- Look, your friends hate me.

19:07.450 --> 19:10.279
- They do not hate you.

19:10.323 --> 19:11.498
You're my chick.

19:11.541 --> 19:13.978
They don't get to hate you.

19:14.022 --> 19:16.546
- I shouldn't have come.

19:16.590 --> 19:19.549
- Look, we just need
one weekend to get past

19:19.593 --> 19:23.031
all the weirdness and
everything'll be fine.

19:23.074 --> 19:24.337
You'll see.

19:24.380 --> 19:26.121
- Well, could we have
picked a weirder place

19:26.165 --> 19:28.558
to get past the weirdness?

19:28.602 --> 19:33.259
- Uh, maybe we just need
to take a little time

19:33.302 --> 19:34.869
to settle in,

19:34.912 --> 19:36.827
make everything a
little bit less weird.

19:36.871 --> 19:37.654
You know?

19:38.916 --> 19:41.180
- Not with demon
baby watching us.

19:41.223 --> 19:45.184
- Uh, it'll be fine.

19:46.359 --> 19:47.229
- Hey, Spence.

19:47.273 --> 19:50.754
- Perfect timing.

19:50.798 --> 19:52.321
- Yo, Spence!

19:53.583 --> 19:54.323
- Come on.

19:55.498 --> 19:56.717
- Spence!

19:56.760 --> 19:57.848
- All right.

19:57.892 --> 19:58.675
All right.

19:59.502 --> 20:00.242
Let's do it.

20:02.113 --> 20:02.984
- Uh.

20:15.475 --> 20:17.607
Hey, man, you sure Laurie's cool

20:17.651 --> 20:19.261
with Tina being here?

20:19.305 --> 20:20.567
She feels pretty awkward.

20:20.610 --> 20:23.874
- Oh, yeah, it's all
water under the bridge.

20:23.918 --> 20:25.354
- Good.

20:25.398 --> 20:26.834
I heard there was just way
too much alcohol involved.

20:26.877 --> 20:28.444
- Yeah, everyone
was blackout drunk.

20:28.488 --> 20:30.185
I don't give a shit.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.795
Laurie will be fine.

20:37.714 --> 20:39.412
- Can I help?

20:39.455 --> 20:40.369
- I'm fine, Tina.

20:40.413 --> 20:41.370
Thanks.

20:51.337 --> 20:53.730
- Between you and me,
I'm just more worried

20:53.774 --> 20:56.472
about the way Laurie's talking
about this whole book deal.

20:56.516 --> 20:57.821
- Why's that?

20:57.865 --> 20:59.475
- I don't know.

20:59.519 --> 21:03.436
I just, something stinks
about it, you know?

21:03.479 --> 21:06.134
I just don't really
believe this publisher guy.

21:06.177 --> 21:08.092
Apparently he talks a good talk.

21:08.136 --> 21:09.311
She's got all these high hopes

21:09.355 --> 21:11.139
for saving her mom's
house and everything.

21:11.182 --> 21:13.097
- Oh, so they are
taking the house?

21:13.141 --> 21:13.881
- Yeah.

21:13.924 --> 21:15.491
Looks like it.

21:15.535 --> 21:17.493
- Shit, man.

23:05.427 --> 23:06.559
- Oh, my God.

23:06.602 --> 23:07.603
- I'm so sorry.

23:08.648 --> 23:09.953
- You scared me.

23:09.997 --> 23:13.043
- I totally did not
mean to sneak up on you.

23:13.087 --> 23:14.088
- It's fine.

23:15.089 --> 23:17.352
- No, it's not fine.

23:17.396 --> 23:21.138
Look, Laurie, I just
really want us to be fine.

23:21.182 --> 23:22.836
- You stuck your tongue
down my boyfriend's throat

23:22.879 --> 23:24.446
when he was drunk.

23:25.621 --> 23:27.362
- Yeah, about that.

23:28.319 --> 23:30.147
I know how terrible it was.

23:30.191 --> 23:30.974
- Good.

23:32.454 --> 23:33.542
You apologized

23:33.586 --> 23:36.545
and I accept your apology.

23:36.589 --> 23:38.634
Let's just leave it at that.

23:38.678 --> 23:39.635
- Thank you.

23:42.333 --> 23:44.031
What'd you find here?

23:45.336 --> 23:47.121
Is that a secret room?

23:48.470 --> 23:49.558
Cool.

23:50.646 --> 23:51.647
- Ladies.

23:53.301 --> 23:56.043
You wanna eat or you
wanna have girl time?

23:56.086 --> 23:56.870
- Eat.

23:57.697 --> 23:59.655
- Come on, it's ready.

24:01.657 --> 24:03.006
- I'll be right there.

24:28.728 --> 24:29.468
- Here.

24:29.511 --> 24:30.904
- Oh, thank you.

24:46.746 --> 24:47.486
- So, uh,

24:50.663 --> 24:52.273
we're cool, right?

24:54.101 --> 24:56.669
- You mean about me sticking
my tongue down your throat?

24:56.712 --> 25:00.368
- Uh, yeah, yeah.

25:02.109 --> 25:03.850
- We're fine, Nick.

25:03.893 --> 25:07.549
It's not like I went
down on you or anything.

25:10.726 --> 25:12.032
I would never do anything

25:12.075 --> 25:14.600
to get in the way
of you and Laurie.

25:21.868 --> 25:24.827
- So, as you guys
know, this place

25:24.871 --> 25:26.568
has a very special history

25:26.612 --> 25:28.831
that few people are aware of.

25:28.875 --> 25:31.399
- Oh crap, we're doing
this right now, huh?

25:31.442 --> 25:32.574
- You know why we came here.

25:33.749 --> 25:34.402
- All right.

25:34.445 --> 25:35.795
Fair enough.

25:35.838 --> 25:37.274
Just need you to get a little
bit closer to me, honey.

25:37.318 --> 25:39.102
I'm gonna need somebody
like right up against me

25:39.146 --> 25:43.454
so nobody can sneak
up as spirits can get.

25:43.498 --> 25:45.718
- So our aunt told us stories

25:45.761 --> 25:48.634
and then her daughters
actually inherited the place.

25:48.677 --> 25:52.594
Luckily for us Samantha kept
in contact with one of them.

25:52.638 --> 25:54.596
- So we're not
supposed to be here?

25:54.640 --> 25:56.642
- No one's allowed
up here anymore.

25:56.685 --> 25:58.208
It was just that Laurie
said she wanted help

25:58.252 --> 26:00.907
with her book so
I wanted to help.

26:02.473 --> 26:05.607
- And you know the full story
about what happened here?

26:05.651 --> 26:06.826
- The way this house was built

26:06.869 --> 26:09.437
had something to do
with the spirit world.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.265
- Keeping spirits out?

26:11.308 --> 26:13.833
- More like keeping one in.

26:13.876 --> 26:16.270
- Which is why it's the
perfect place for my research.

26:16.313 --> 26:17.706
- That sounds great and all,

26:17.750 --> 26:21.710
but what about all
the weird baby stuff?

26:21.754 --> 26:24.060
- Our ancestors
were good witches.

26:24.104 --> 26:27.107
They lived in harmony with
each other and with nature.

26:31.807 --> 26:34.288
They held ceremonies
on sacred lands

26:34.331 --> 26:36.725
not far from where we are now.

26:36.769 --> 26:37.726
They believed that
certain stones

26:37.770 --> 26:41.295
held a type of power, an energy.

26:41.338 --> 26:44.298
They would use them
for healing people.

26:44.341 --> 26:46.735
The witches bonded
in a sisterhood.

26:46.779 --> 26:48.694
Close-knit, like a family.

26:50.043 --> 26:52.523
In each coven there
was a male witch.

26:52.567 --> 26:53.350
A warlock.

26:54.874 --> 26:56.092
It was when he joined
that the trouble started.

26:59.052 --> 27:00.793
He became obsessed
with black magic

27:00.836 --> 27:04.144
and the control it gave
him over people's minds.

27:04.187 --> 27:07.538
With his spells the warlock
was able to hypnotize people

27:07.582 --> 27:10.541
and he started his
own coven of witches,

27:10.585 --> 27:13.719
evil witches who
would serve him.

27:13.762 --> 27:15.764
They worshiped a pagan god,

27:15.808 --> 27:17.679
a being of true evil.

27:19.768 --> 27:21.117
He slaughtered a
ram and fashioned

27:21.161 --> 27:24.817
a ceremonial headpiece
from the blood and horns.

27:31.562 --> 27:33.695
With the still warm ram's
blood he drew letters

27:33.739 --> 27:36.132
on the writhing
bodies of his coven.

27:36.176 --> 27:38.787
The arcane use of symbology
was an important key

27:38.831 --> 27:41.834
to opening doors
to their pagan god.

27:41.877 --> 27:45.185
And the warlock became
obsessed with freeing it.

27:45.228 --> 27:48.710
He became obsessed with
word and number games.

27:48.754 --> 27:50.016
He thought that
they were the key

27:50.059 --> 27:52.975
to opening gates to
other dimensions.

27:56.239 --> 27:58.111
And then came the babies.

28:00.591 --> 28:03.943
The witches would
kidnap families from
the nearby village,

28:03.986 --> 28:06.119
families with newborns.

28:19.436 --> 28:21.177
The warlock would force
the parents to play

28:21.221 --> 28:26.835
one of his word games but the
villagers would never win.

28:35.975 --> 28:37.193
They would watch as their babies

28:37.237 --> 28:39.761
were handed over to the warlock,

28:39.805 --> 28:41.894
never to be seen again.

28:55.037 --> 28:57.953
He believed that newborns
were able to create

28:57.997 --> 29:00.564
a portal because they were
the first to experience

29:00.608 --> 29:02.915
a new plain of existence.

29:02.958 --> 29:04.351
- Jesus.

29:04.394 --> 29:05.265
Did your great aunt
just want you all

29:05.308 --> 29:06.788
to have nightmares forever?

29:08.007 --> 29:08.747
- Yeah.

29:08.790 --> 29:10.183
That's messed up.

29:10.226 --> 29:12.838
- I think it was to scare
us out of coming up here.

29:12.881 --> 29:14.709
- Well, I guess
that didn't work.

29:14.753 --> 29:15.928
- No, it didn't.

29:15.971 --> 29:17.538
And, guess what?

29:17.581 --> 29:19.235
I found a Ouija board here.

29:19.279 --> 29:20.933
We're gonna play it tonight.

29:20.976 --> 29:21.934
- No!

29:21.977 --> 29:23.674
No we're not.

29:23.718 --> 29:25.676
- Oh, yes we are.

29:25.720 --> 29:27.243
I found it in the
hidden compartment.

29:27.287 --> 29:28.201
We were just gonna do a seance

29:28.244 --> 29:30.507
but this is so much better.

29:32.031 --> 29:33.815
Just gimme a minute.

30:13.942 --> 30:18.077
- All right, which
one of you assholes took it?

30:18.120 --> 30:19.861
- Took what?

30:19.905 --> 30:24.997
- You guys were the only
ones that saw me with it.

30:25.040 --> 30:28.043
- We're not playing any tricks.

30:28.087 --> 30:29.044
- Uh, honey?

30:41.317 --> 30:43.885
- Nobody knows
we're here, right?

30:50.936 --> 30:52.415
Oh, it's some guy.

30:52.459 --> 30:53.199
- Shit.

30:55.418 --> 30:57.290
The caretaker.

30:57.333 --> 30:58.073
- What?

30:59.379 --> 31:00.859
- I'm not here.

31:00.902 --> 31:01.990
- Samantha?

31:12.044 --> 31:14.350
- You're inside the house.

31:14.394 --> 31:15.177
- Right.

31:16.352 --> 31:18.050
- Where's Samantha?

31:18.093 --> 31:20.487
- She's indisposed.

31:20.530 --> 31:21.314
- Samantha!

31:21.357 --> 31:22.881
- Dude, chill, man.

31:24.012 --> 31:27.059
- She said there
would just be her

31:27.102 --> 31:29.496
and now there are all these
people inside the house.

31:29.539 --> 31:30.889
- Listen, man, I'm sorry

31:30.932 --> 31:31.585
if there's been a
misunderstanding...

31:31.628 --> 31:33.065
- Shh, one moment.

31:33.108 --> 31:34.718
One moment please.

31:37.504 --> 31:39.941
It's this thing I have.

31:39.985 --> 31:41.116
It helps me focus.

31:41.160 --> 31:42.509
I can only talk to
one person at a time.

31:42.552 --> 31:45.991
And right now I am
listening to this girl.

31:46.034 --> 31:48.515
When I'm finished
listening to her,

31:48.558 --> 31:51.997
I have time to hear
what you have to say.

31:52.040 --> 31:53.041
- Seriously?

31:53.085 --> 31:54.390
- It's okay.

31:54.434 --> 31:56.044
- Samantha and I had
an understanding.

31:56.088 --> 31:59.439
No other people would
be inside this house.

32:00.701 --> 32:03.443
I, I told her it wasn't safe.

32:03.486 --> 32:04.923
There was, mold.

32:06.750 --> 32:08.013
And, you don't wanna
breathe in mold.

32:08.056 --> 32:09.797
I mean, if you get
mold inside your lungs

32:09.840 --> 32:13.105
you can seriously
poison yourself.

32:13.148 --> 32:14.062
- It's just for a few nights.

32:14.106 --> 32:14.976
Can't you just overlook it.

32:15.020 --> 32:16.935
- Yeah, man.

32:18.501 --> 32:19.415
- It's...

32:23.202 --> 32:24.116
Well, it's you!

32:24.159 --> 32:25.378
- Hold it.

32:25.421 --> 32:26.248
- All right.

32:26.292 --> 32:27.032
You, look.

32:28.555 --> 32:30.296
I got about $500 cash.

32:32.689 --> 32:33.952
What do you say
we just crash here

32:33.995 --> 32:36.128
for the night so we can
sober up before we go?

32:36.171 --> 32:37.651
- No, no, that's
not why I'm here.

32:37.694 --> 32:39.348
You don't understand.

32:39.392 --> 32:41.785
Uh, I can't take your money.

32:47.226 --> 32:47.966
We're,

32:51.578 --> 32:52.971
we're good.

32:53.014 --> 32:55.886
Uh, let's just say
I didn't see you,

32:57.192 --> 32:58.280
you didn't see me

32:58.324 --> 33:00.979
and we didn't have
this conversation.

33:02.502 --> 33:06.071
Just leave the house
the way you found it.

33:11.206 --> 33:13.208
- That was really weird.

33:13.252 --> 33:14.209
- Yeah.

33:14.253 --> 33:15.645
- Yeah?

33:17.734 --> 33:20.476
- What the hell did
he want with you?

33:20.520 --> 33:22.000
- I have no idea.

33:23.218 --> 33:24.437
- Is he gone?

33:24.480 --> 33:25.351
- Yeah.

33:25.394 --> 33:26.091
He looked really familiar.

33:26.134 --> 33:27.353
What was that all about?

33:27.396 --> 33:30.051
- Don't worry, Tomas
is a little off.

33:30.095 --> 33:32.184
Let's get back to the game.

33:38.277 --> 33:39.017
- No.

33:39.060 --> 33:40.061
No, no, no, no.

33:40.105 --> 33:41.019
Please, please, please.

33:41.062 --> 33:42.063
Please.

33:51.638 --> 33:52.421
Come on.

33:54.467 --> 33:55.294
Come on.

34:01.213 --> 34:03.998
- Before we start can you just
admit to moving the board?

34:04.042 --> 34:05.565
- I didn't touch the board.

34:05.608 --> 34:07.393
- I just don't want it to
affect any of the tests, okay?

34:07.436 --> 34:08.568
So it's totally
fine if you did...

34:08.610 --> 34:10.047
- It wasn't us.

34:10.091 --> 34:11.223
- It had to be the
only other person

34:11.266 --> 34:13.529
who knew where the board was.

34:14.748 --> 34:16.271
- I wasn't anywhere
near the table.

34:16.315 --> 34:18.056
We all saw what happened.

34:18.099 --> 34:19.969
- All right, fine.

34:20.014 --> 34:20.884
Let's play.

34:20.928 --> 34:23.235
Has anybody not played before?

34:23.277 --> 34:24.062
- Not me.

34:25.018 --> 34:26.063
- Really?

34:26.107 --> 34:27.108
Okay.

34:27.152 --> 34:28.630
So the rules are simple.

34:28.675 --> 34:30.197
Never play alone.

34:30.242 --> 34:31.330
Never play where someone's
been murdered before

34:31.373 --> 34:35.072
and always say goodbye
before you leave.

34:35.116 --> 34:36.900
We're gonna be breaking
rule number two tonight

34:36.944 --> 34:40.034
but it's to see how much
activity we can get.

34:40.078 --> 34:41.818
Everybody put your
hand on the planchette.

34:46.431 --> 34:49.174
Is there a spirit
with us tonight?

34:56.181 --> 34:57.182
- Well, I'm gonna
grab another drink...

34:57.225 --> 34:58.487
- No.

34:58.531 --> 35:02.317
You have to keep your
hands on the planchette.

35:03.710 --> 35:04.841
- Oh, oh, oh.

35:06.582 --> 35:07.496
- Oh, shit.

35:15.939 --> 35:17.202
- Yes.

35:17.245 --> 35:19.117
There is a spirit here.

35:21.510 --> 35:22.642
- Spirit?

35:22.685 --> 35:24.426
May we know your name?

35:30.780 --> 35:31.564
- P

35:33.653 --> 35:34.436
L

35:35.785 --> 35:36.569
A

35:37.918 --> 35:38.701
Y

35:40.486 --> 35:41.269
G

35:42.662 --> 35:43.445
A

35:44.664 --> 35:45.447
M

35:47.971 --> 35:49.364
E.

35:49.408 --> 35:50.974
- Play game.

35:51.018 --> 35:52.150
- We are playing, dude.

35:52.193 --> 35:53.673
- Shh.

35:53.716 --> 35:55.283
Spirit, what game?

36:07.295 --> 36:09.515
Uh, don't be shy.

36:09.558 --> 36:11.299
- That's it?

36:11.343 --> 36:12.518
- Well you probably made it mad.

36:13.345 --> 36:15.129
Spirit, are you there?

36:15.173 --> 36:18.176
- You know, maybe the spirit
just wasn't feeling talkative.

36:18.219 --> 36:19.394
- Yeah, you're right.

36:19.438 --> 36:20.700
I mean, maybe
there's another one

36:20.743 --> 36:23.311
that's in a mood
to be more social.

36:23.355 --> 36:25.270
Come on, let's play again.

36:29.491 --> 36:33.365
Is there a spirit here
present with us tonight?

36:42.374 --> 36:43.375
Hello, spirit.

36:43.418 --> 36:45.420
May we know your name?

36:50.599 --> 36:51.383
- P

36:52.688 --> 36:53.472
L

36:55.343 --> 36:56.083
A.

36:56.126 --> 36:57.432
- Play game?

36:57.476 --> 36:59.347
- Again?

36:59.391 --> 37:00.305
- What game?

37:06.398 --> 37:07.181
- G

37:08.965 --> 37:09.749
U

37:11.403 --> 37:12.186
E

37:15.015 --> 37:15.798
S

37:18.453 --> 37:19.237
S

37:20.455 --> 37:21.239
W

37:22.849 --> 37:23.632
O

37:24.894 --> 37:25.678
R

37:27.593 --> 37:28.376
D.

37:29.377 --> 37:30.422
- Guess word.

37:36.341 --> 37:37.124
- L

37:38.778 --> 37:39.561
E

37:41.607 --> 37:42.390
G

37:44.523 --> 37:45.306
N

37:47.003 --> 37:47.787
A.

37:49.179 --> 37:49.963
- Legna?

37:50.920 --> 37:52.139
What is legna?

37:52.182 --> 37:53.096
- I don't know.

37:53.140 --> 37:54.272
It said guess word.

37:54.315 --> 37:56.448
- What does that mean?

37:56.491 --> 37:59.189
- It's an anagram.

37:59.233 --> 38:00.626
- Angel.

38:00.669 --> 38:02.497
Yeah, why don't we guess angel?

38:02.541 --> 38:03.455
- Yes.

38:03.498 --> 38:05.935
Spirit, is the word angel?

38:05.979 --> 38:06.762
- Yeah.

38:06.806 --> 38:07.676
Are you an angel?

38:16.555 --> 38:17.295
- G

38:18.383 --> 38:19.384
L

38:20.602 --> 38:21.386
E

38:23.083 --> 38:23.866
A

38:26.304 --> 38:27.087
N.

38:28.131 --> 38:29.655
- No way.

38:29.698 --> 38:31.265
- Glean?

38:31.309 --> 38:32.179
The correct word's glean?

38:32.222 --> 38:33.006
Seriously?

38:39.534 --> 38:41.144
- That's really strange.

38:41.188 --> 38:42.450
I have never had a spirit try

38:42.494 --> 38:44.539
and play a game with me before.

38:44.583 --> 38:47.455
- Well, spirits are
said to be playful.

38:47.499 --> 38:49.762
You never know who
you're talking to.

38:49.805 --> 38:51.329
- Or who's cheating.

38:54.288 --> 38:55.507
- Well, you actually
don't even need

38:55.550 --> 38:57.509
a board for this to work.

38:57.552 --> 38:58.423
- That's true.

38:58.466 --> 39:00.076
I mean it all started in Morocco

39:00.120 --> 39:02.383
when snake charmers
would play flutes

39:02.427 --> 39:05.517
and the snakes would bob their
heads to different letters.

39:05.560 --> 39:08.128
- Oh, I am so out if
you're bringing out snakes.

39:08.171 --> 39:08.955
You're not bringing
out snakes are you?

39:10.435 --> 39:12.872
No, seriously, I haven't
watch Raiders of the Lost Ark

39:12.915 --> 39:15.004
because of the snakes.

39:15.048 --> 39:16.136
I'm not doing the snakes.

39:16.919 --> 39:17.877
I'm not doing that.

39:17.920 --> 39:19.139
- Potty break.

39:19.182 --> 39:19.966
Sorry.

39:21.707 --> 39:22.882
- There's no snakes.

39:22.925 --> 39:23.796
- If there are snakes
coming out here,

39:23.839 --> 39:25.493
let me know 'cause I'm out.

40:57.106 --> 40:57.846
- Hello?

40:59.718 --> 41:02.416
- She's here, Katherine.

41:03.373 --> 41:04.157
- Tomas?

41:05.288 --> 41:07.508
- She's inside the house.

41:07.552 --> 41:09.292
- What?

41:09.336 --> 41:13.296
- I told you I only pretended
to be her publisher.

41:13.340 --> 41:15.298
Her cousin, Samantha,
wanted to see the house.

41:15.342 --> 41:18.606
I, I tried to get close
and ruin their plans.

41:18.650 --> 41:21.827
I told her not to
go inside the house.

41:21.870 --> 41:23.089
But, the little brat
wouldn't listen.

41:23.132 --> 41:25.700
She, she just couldn't listen.

41:27.180 --> 41:29.617
- Tomas, you have to
get 'em out of there.

41:29.661 --> 41:31.227
You hear me?

41:31.271 --> 41:32.664
- I, I can't go back.

41:32.707 --> 41:34.883
- Tomas, you have to
get 'em out of there.

41:34.927 --> 41:36.189
You understand?

41:37.059 --> 41:38.626
- I'm sorry, Katherine.

41:38.670 --> 41:39.888
- Please!

41:39.932 --> 41:42.543
You've gotta get
Laurie out of there!

41:45.415 --> 41:46.155
Tomas!

42:06.219 --> 42:07.525
- Tomas.

42:11.224 --> 42:12.007
- No, no!

42:15.924 --> 42:17.578
No!

42:17.622 --> 42:18.405
No!

42:44.039 --> 42:44.779
- What is it?

42:44.823 --> 42:45.693
- A snake.

42:45.737 --> 42:46.607
There was a snake in here.

42:46.651 --> 42:47.390
- A snake?

42:47.434 --> 42:48.435
Oh, hell no.

42:49.828 --> 42:51.569
- Wait, are you
sure it was a snake?

42:51.612 --> 42:53.222
- I saw a tail go
in that corner.

42:53.266 --> 42:56.399
I swear to God it
looked like a snake.

42:59.533 --> 43:00.795
- I'm sure it's harmless.

43:00.839 --> 43:02.580
Or maybe it was maybe
just like a rat's tail.

43:02.623 --> 43:03.624
- Eww.

43:03.668 --> 43:04.582
- A rat?

43:04.625 --> 43:06.671
Yeah, because that's way better.

43:06.714 --> 43:07.628
- Where is it?

43:07.672 --> 43:08.934
- Look, this is an old house.

43:08.977 --> 43:10.718
A lot of things
get in these walls.

43:10.762 --> 43:12.241
Let's just continue.

43:12.285 --> 43:13.025
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

43:13.068 --> 43:13.982
- Come on.

43:14.026 --> 43:16.158
Let's move on to phase two.

43:36.048 --> 43:37.789
- Hey, did you guys hear that?

44:42.636 --> 44:44.551
- Babe, if you see
that snake you...

44:44.594 --> 44:46.074
- Oh, don't worry.

44:46.118 --> 44:49.599
I know just what
to do with snakes.

44:49.643 --> 44:51.340
- Yeah, I bet you do.

44:52.515 --> 44:53.691
Babe, you mind
getting me a drink?

44:53.734 --> 44:55.040
- Sure.

44:55.083 --> 44:56.911
For my favorite anaconda.

44:56.955 --> 44:57.912
- Mmm, h oh.

44:59.566 --> 45:00.349
Thank you.

45:05.920 --> 45:07.313
- Hey, Samantha?

45:10.142 --> 45:11.883
Sorry.

45:11.926 --> 45:12.710
Samantha?

45:27.072 --> 45:27.855
Samantha?

46:13.422 --> 46:16.208
Hey, did you see
where Samantha went?

46:16.251 --> 46:18.340
- Maybe she went for a walk.

46:18.384 --> 46:19.646
- It's kind of a weird time

46:19.689 --> 46:21.953
to go for a walk,
don't you think?

46:21.996 --> 46:23.084
Did you do this?

46:23.128 --> 46:23.911
- What?

46:25.739 --> 46:27.741
- Just let me do it, babe.

46:54.899 --> 46:57.162
Come on.

46:57.205 --> 47:00.774
Come on, come on.

47:03.472 --> 47:04.212
- Katherine.

47:04.256 --> 47:05.039
- Tomas?

47:06.693 --> 47:08.042
Tomas is that you?

47:09.565 --> 47:10.479
- Katherine!

47:41.946 --> 47:43.164
- All right, are we ready?

47:43.208 --> 47:44.296
- I think so.

47:48.561 --> 47:50.780
- How did that get there?

48:04.664 --> 48:07.885
- I think I have an
idea for phase two.

48:11.714 --> 48:12.585
- Oh, damn.

48:18.591 --> 48:19.592
- Seriously?

48:21.072 --> 48:23.639
- How did you get that on there?

48:25.032 --> 48:27.208
- It's called Hot Passion.

48:28.644 --> 48:31.821
You said it didn't
have to be a board.

48:33.084 --> 48:33.823
Come on.

48:33.867 --> 48:35.564
It'll be interesting.

48:36.826 --> 48:38.959
- You forgot goodbye.

48:39.003 --> 48:40.569
- Let's play.

48:40.613 --> 48:42.876
- All right, fine.

48:44.095 --> 48:45.792
Are you gonna film this or what?

48:45.835 --> 48:46.619
- Yeah.

48:55.758 --> 48:57.369
- Where the hell is Samantha?

48:57.412 --> 48:59.849
- She's missing out.

49:01.112 --> 49:02.940
- Fine, let's do this
before I feel sober

49:02.983 --> 49:04.680
and I change my mind.

49:15.865 --> 49:16.736
- You got it?

49:16.779 --> 49:17.563
- Yep.

49:19.565 --> 49:20.783
- Okay.

49:21.828 --> 49:24.135
- All right, let's do this.

49:33.318 --> 49:36.582
Is there a spirit
here with us tonight?

50:10.094 --> 50:11.095
- Not bad.

50:12.270 --> 50:16.100
- Hey, not at all.

50:16.143 --> 50:18.189
- Okay.

50:18.232 --> 50:20.626
If it's the same spirit that
was here with us earlier,

50:20.669 --> 50:22.628
we wanna know your name.

50:28.416 --> 50:29.200
- Oh, oh.

50:48.784 --> 50:50.743
- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

50:59.317 --> 51:01.058
- Jesus Christ!

51:01.101 --> 51:01.884
Tina!

51:02.711 --> 51:04.191
She's choking.

51:04.235 --> 51:05.366
Tina, she's choking.

51:05.410 --> 51:06.106
- Okay, we'll get her up.
- We better...

51:06.150 --> 51:07.368
- Come on, come on.

51:07.412 --> 51:08.369
Oh, my God.

51:08.413 --> 51:11.024
We gotta call an ambulance, P!

51:12.808 --> 51:14.201
- Hang in there, baby.

51:14.245 --> 51:17.291
Come on, Tina.

51:17.335 --> 51:18.075
Come on, baby.
- Got her?

51:18.118 --> 51:19.076
- Stay with me.

51:20.164 --> 51:21.774
- What the fuck?

51:21.817 --> 51:23.167
There's no signal.

51:24.733 --> 51:26.126
- What do I do?

51:26.170 --> 51:27.258
- We've
gotta do something.

51:27.301 --> 51:29.695
- Come on, come on.

51:29.738 --> 51:31.218
- Back up, back up.

51:32.263 --> 51:33.438
One, two, three, four.

51:33.481 --> 51:35.135
One, two, three, four.

51:35.179 --> 51:36.049
One, two, three, four.
- Come on, Tina.

51:36.093 --> 51:36.963
Come on, baby.

51:37.006 --> 51:38.704
- Tina, come on, baby.

51:38.747 --> 51:39.574
One, two, three, four.

51:39.618 --> 51:40.967
One, two, three, four.

51:41.010 --> 51:42.447
One, two, three, four.

51:42.490 --> 51:44.840
- Oh my god, baby.

51:44.884 --> 51:46.146
- One,
two, three, four.

51:46.190 --> 51:47.321
One, two, three, four.

51:47.365 --> 51:48.583
One, two, three, four.

51:48.627 --> 51:49.932
- Come on.

51:49.976 --> 51:50.716
- One,
two, three, four.

51:50.759 --> 51:51.543
One, two, three, four.

51:51.586 --> 51:53.240
One, two, three, four.

51:53.284 --> 51:54.285
- Come on, Tina.

51:54.328 --> 51:55.982
- Come on.

51:56.896 --> 51:58.550
- I'm sorry.

51:58.593 --> 51:59.333
She...

52:09.604 --> 52:11.476
- Hey, hey, hey!

52:11.519 --> 52:12.259
Hey, look at me.

52:12.303 --> 52:13.304
Look at me.

52:13.347 --> 52:14.087
Look at me, baby.

52:14.131 --> 52:14.870
Look at my eyes.

52:14.914 --> 52:16.263
Are you okay?

52:16.307 --> 52:17.134
Are you okay?

52:19.005 --> 52:20.180
Are you okay?

52:22.226 --> 52:22.965
Oh, my God.

52:23.009 --> 52:24.141
- Is she okay?

52:24.184 --> 52:25.577
- Oh, thank God.

52:28.623 --> 52:29.929
We're getting out of here.

52:29.972 --> 52:31.931
We need to get to a
hospital right now.

52:31.974 --> 52:32.714
- Let's go.

52:32.758 --> 52:33.976
- Come on!

52:39.982 --> 52:40.896
- Samantha!

52:42.333 --> 52:43.290
Samantha!

52:43.334 --> 52:44.204
- We'll come back for her.

52:44.248 --> 52:45.336
- I can't just leave my cousin!

52:45.379 --> 52:46.989
I gotta find her.

52:47.033 --> 52:48.339
- Sweetheart, Spence is right.

52:48.382 --> 52:50.123
We gotta take Tina
to the hospital.

52:50.167 --> 52:50.950
We'll come right back.

52:50.993 --> 52:52.430
I promise.

52:52.473 --> 52:54.388
- Shit.
- Get in the car.

52:55.737 --> 52:56.477
- Are we good?

52:56.521 --> 52:57.870
- Yeah.

53:07.096 --> 53:08.097
- Tina.

53:08.141 --> 53:08.881
- Put your shirt on.

53:08.924 --> 53:09.708
- Here.

53:10.796 --> 53:12.101
Something is wrong.

53:12.145 --> 53:13.277
We should've seen
the exit by now.

53:13.320 --> 53:15.540
- I didn't
see any turns.

53:26.203 --> 53:27.073
- Wait.

53:27.116 --> 53:27.726
Look, there's a light up there.

53:27.769 --> 53:28.770
Go that way.

53:35.734 --> 53:37.431
- What in the hell?

53:38.824 --> 53:39.607
- What did you do?

53:39.651 --> 53:40.565
You went in a circle?

53:40.608 --> 53:42.349
- Everyone pay attention.

54:17.123 --> 54:17.906
- No.

54:20.300 --> 54:22.171
- What is happening?

54:22.215 --> 54:24.870
- We opened up a portal
and forgot to close it.

54:24.913 --> 54:26.045
We have to destroy it.

54:26.088 --> 54:27.307
- Destroy what, Laurie?

54:27.351 --> 54:28.613
- The Ouija board.

54:28.656 --> 54:29.396
- This is insane.

54:29.440 --> 54:31.224
- You saw what happened.

54:31.268 --> 54:32.051
Come on.

55:10.437 --> 55:11.525
- Samantha?

55:23.537 --> 55:25.060
- Who's in there?

55:32.329 --> 55:36.507
What the hell are you
doing in here, man?

55:36.550 --> 55:38.117
Where is our friend?

55:41.990 --> 55:43.340
Don't try it.

55:43.383 --> 55:44.732
Just take it easy.

55:47.822 --> 55:49.520
- You don't get it.

55:51.522 --> 55:52.784
None of you do.

55:54.263 --> 55:56.135
It won't let you leave.

55:57.571 --> 56:02.750
It'll keep you playing the
game until everyone dies.

56:02.794 --> 56:05.579
The only way to win is to get
out but you can't get out.

56:05.623 --> 56:07.494
That's the trick.

56:07.538 --> 56:10.062
- What are you talking about?

56:10.105 --> 56:13.282
- I knew your mother
when I was young.

56:14.675 --> 56:15.763
Just like you

56:17.330 --> 56:20.289
she thought it would be fun
to see what it was like.

56:20.333 --> 56:22.422
Then she tried to stop it.

56:22.466 --> 56:25.469
And just like you,
she brought it back.

56:28.167 --> 56:29.647
- What back, Tomas?

56:36.741 --> 56:38.133
- It's too late.

56:40.788 --> 56:43.878
You already started
playing the game.

56:45.140 --> 56:47.839
I'm sorry I couldn't
help your mother.

56:47.882 --> 56:48.796
- No!
- No, no, no, no.

56:49.493 --> 56:50.494
- Don't!

56:52.844 --> 56:53.932
Come on.

56:53.975 --> 56:55.063
- Where?

56:55.107 --> 56:56.456
Where will we go?

56:56.500 --> 56:58.545
- We burned the board,
we closed the portal.

56:58.589 --> 57:00.678
Let's get out of here now!

57:08.294 --> 57:09.295
What?

57:09.338 --> 57:10.470
Oh, my tires!

57:10.514 --> 57:11.515
No!

57:12.429 --> 57:14.126
That crazy asshole!

57:14.169 --> 57:15.432
He did something to your cousin.

57:15.475 --> 57:16.302
he's been screwing
with us all night.

57:16.345 --> 57:17.477
Either that or it's her.

57:17.521 --> 57:18.565
- It's not Samantha, okay?

57:18.609 --> 57:19.740
Something bigger is happening.

57:19.784 --> 57:21.002
- Look, guys, we have to

57:21.046 --> 57:22.308
get the fuck out
of here, all right?

57:22.351 --> 57:23.004
- Then we're gonna
have to go on foot.

57:23.048 --> 57:23.788
- Fine.

57:23.831 --> 57:24.615
Let's go.

57:27.095 --> 57:28.575
- Tina!

57:28.619 --> 57:30.272
Baby, what's wrong,
what's wrong?

57:30.316 --> 57:31.273
- My stomach.

57:32.100 --> 57:32.840
Oh.

57:34.886 --> 57:35.626
- What?

57:35.669 --> 57:36.583
Huh?

57:36.627 --> 57:37.497
Oh, my God.

57:37.541 --> 57:38.890
Hey, we gotta do something!

57:39.717 --> 57:41.327
- Talk to me.

57:41.370 --> 57:42.110
Come on, baby.

57:42.154 --> 57:43.764
What's wrong?

57:43.808 --> 57:45.113
- We gotta get her
inside the house.

57:45.157 --> 57:46.419
Come on.

57:46.463 --> 57:47.333
- All right, come on.

57:47.376 --> 57:49.335
Hang on, hang on, baby.

57:49.378 --> 57:50.597
Oh, my God.

57:50.641 --> 57:51.685
- Go, go, go.

57:59.171 --> 58:00.738
What can we do?

58:00.781 --> 58:02.261
- Oh my God, you guys,
she's burning up.

58:02.304 --> 58:04.829
Can you please get her some ice?

58:23.891 --> 58:25.589
- Hey, look at me, honey.

58:25.632 --> 58:27.155
Can you hear me?

58:27.199 --> 58:28.505
Do you hear me?

58:30.637 --> 58:32.683
- I'm okay, baby.

58:32.726 --> 58:34.293
Just a little tired.

58:39.211 --> 58:40.604
- What do we do?

58:40.647 --> 58:42.301
Is she in shock?

58:42.344 --> 58:44.216
- Look, we just have
to keep her comfortable

58:44.259 --> 58:46.871
till we can figure
something out.

58:48.133 --> 58:50.527
- We can't stay
in here with him.

58:57.577 --> 59:02.713
- Don't
look at his face.

59:02.756 --> 59:03.670
Grab his legs.

59:11.025 --> 59:11.896
Let's check his phone too,

59:11.939 --> 59:13.898
see if he's got a signal.

59:13.941 --> 59:14.681
Okay, you.

59:25.997 --> 59:27.738
- Laurie, I'm thirsty.

59:29.957 --> 59:31.393
- Okay, sweetheart.

59:31.437 --> 59:33.439
I'll get you some water.

59:47.322 --> 59:51.326
- Tina, I just want to apologize
for the way that I was...

59:57.289 --> 59:58.812
Tina?

59:58.856 --> 01:00:01.162
- I can hear them.

01:00:01.206 --> 01:00:02.207
All of them.

01:00:04.035 --> 01:00:05.340
- Who?

01:00:06.777 --> 01:00:08.343
- The babies.

01:00:18.136 --> 01:00:18.919
- Oh, my God, no.

01:00:18.963 --> 01:00:19.703
Tina, no!

01:00:23.228 --> 01:00:24.229
Nick, Spence!

01:00:24.272 --> 01:00:25.056
Get out here.

01:00:28.886 --> 01:00:30.757
- What happened?

01:00:35.283 --> 01:00:37.242
- I could hear them all.

01:00:38.330 --> 01:00:39.723
I could hear them crying.

01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:46.686
- No one leaves this room
for the rest of the night.

01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:47.731
We all clear?

01:01:12.712 --> 01:01:16.716
- It says here that the
warlock would force parents

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:20.807
to solve an anagram and
the ones that failed

01:01:20.851 --> 01:01:22.896
were slaughtered and their
babies were sacrificed

01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:24.419
to the tree gods.

01:03:00.907 --> 01:03:01.821
- Nick!

01:03:06.043 --> 01:03:06.783
Oh, Nick!

01:03:08.959 --> 01:03:09.916
I'm up here.

01:03:13.006 --> 01:03:13.746
Come on.

01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:14.791
I'm waiting.

01:03:24.626 --> 01:03:25.410
- Tina?

01:03:38.466 --> 01:03:39.424
Tina?

01:03:47.519 --> 01:03:48.302
Tina.

01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:52.393
Tina.

01:03:56.876 --> 01:03:57.877
Guys!

01:03:59.313 --> 01:04:00.053
Guys!

01:04:01.881 --> 01:04:02.969
Guys!

01:04:03.013 --> 01:04:03.840
- Tina!

01:04:05.885 --> 01:04:07.452
- Upstairs!

01:04:07.495 --> 01:04:08.235
Look at her.

01:04:08.279 --> 01:04:09.062
Oh shit.

01:04:09.106 --> 01:04:09.976
Tina!

01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:11.021
Tina.

01:04:13.675 --> 01:04:14.763
What, what happened?

01:04:14.807 --> 01:04:15.852
- I don't know.

01:04:15.895 --> 01:04:16.635
She just kept
head-butting the wall.

01:04:16.678 --> 01:04:17.679
- Tina.

01:04:17.723 --> 01:04:18.463
Wake up.

01:04:18.506 --> 01:04:19.290
Tina, Tina, come on.

01:04:19.333 --> 01:04:20.944
Come on, come on Tina.

01:04:20.987 --> 01:04:21.770
Wake up, baby.

01:04:21.814 --> 01:04:22.597
What...

01:04:29.126 --> 01:04:30.867
Tina come on, come on.

01:04:43.096 --> 01:04:44.489
- Tina, come on.

01:04:49.407 --> 01:04:50.625
Wake up, Tina.

01:04:51.452 --> 01:04:52.889
Come on, Tina.

01:04:52.932 --> 01:04:54.107
Wake up, baby.

01:05:03.812 --> 01:05:05.075
- Let her move.

01:05:06.250 --> 01:05:08.556
Put your hands on her.

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:10.297
Would you put your hands on her?

01:05:10.341 --> 01:05:11.429
- What the hell is happening?

01:05:11.472 --> 01:05:12.909
- Just trust me.

01:05:28.141 --> 01:05:30.013
- Wait, stop, stop!
- Stop her.

01:05:30.056 --> 01:05:31.101
- Stop, Tina.

01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:36.845
- Come on Tina.

01:05:44.201 --> 01:05:45.419
- Pull her back,
pull her back some.

01:05:45.463 --> 01:05:48.205
Tina, what the
hell are you doing?

01:05:58.258 --> 01:05:59.042
Come on.

01:06:18.017 --> 01:06:19.888
- You guys, get her back!

01:06:19.932 --> 01:06:21.151
- Tina, stay here.

01:06:21.194 --> 01:06:21.978
Sit down.

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:26.112
- It's gonna be an A.

01:06:26.156 --> 01:06:26.895
- You got her?

01:06:26.939 --> 01:06:27.722
- Yeah.

01:06:35.687 --> 01:06:36.470
Tina.

01:06:39.082 --> 01:06:39.952
- Play game.

01:06:41.084 --> 01:06:44.391
- Laurie, What the
hell is going on?

01:06:44.435 --> 01:06:47.220
- You gotta help me get
the rest of the paint down.

01:07:40.795 --> 01:07:42.188
- Laurie?

01:07:43.885 --> 01:07:46.845
- This house is a
giant Ouija board.

01:08:02.252 --> 01:08:03.905
Tell us who you are.

01:08:08.171 --> 01:08:09.128
Who are you?

01:08:23.577 --> 01:08:25.013
- Tina!

01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:30.236
- You got her?

01:08:30.279 --> 01:08:31.281
- Yeah.

01:08:31.323 --> 01:08:32.978
- You got her?

01:08:40.464 --> 01:08:41.247
- What?

01:08:42.205 --> 01:08:44.120
- Roka.

01:08:44.162 --> 01:08:47.252
Samantha!

01:08:47.296 --> 01:08:50.082
Samantha!

01:08:51.170 --> 01:08:53.129
- Laurie, Laurie.

01:08:54.912 --> 01:08:55.696
- Tina.

01:08:56.783 --> 01:08:58.264
- Oh my God!

01:08:58.308 --> 01:08:59.178
- Come on.

01:08:59.221 --> 01:09:00.310
- Samantha!

01:09:05.488 --> 01:09:06.229
- It's okay.

01:09:06.272 --> 01:09:07.273
It's okay.

01:09:07.317 --> 01:09:08.055
Look at me.

01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:14.279
We need to get out of here.

01:09:14.323 --> 01:09:15.716
Laurie, come on.

01:09:23.768 --> 01:09:25.595
- You got her?

01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:33.386
- What happened?

01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:35.953
- How the hell did
we end up in here?

01:09:39.261 --> 01:09:40.959
- Come on.

01:09:43.221 --> 01:09:45.398
- Laurie, what's going on?

01:09:57.062 --> 01:09:58.846
- He's toying with us.

01:10:00.021 --> 01:10:02.589
Roka, we wish to play your game.

01:10:02.633 --> 01:10:05.331
We wish to play with you, Roka.

01:10:08.813 --> 01:10:09.596
Come on.

01:10:14.732 --> 01:10:15.994
- There you go.

01:10:18.910 --> 01:10:19.693
Ah, baby.

01:10:21.652 --> 01:10:22.435
Oh.

01:10:22.479 --> 01:10:23.915
- What now?

01:10:26.396 --> 01:10:27.571
- We learn his rules.

01:10:38.408 --> 01:10:42.455
- Okay, so the house is
forcing us to play its game.

01:10:44.283 --> 01:10:47.330
What exactly is going
on here, Laurie?

01:10:47.373 --> 01:10:50.985
- The story Samantha
told about the warlock.

01:10:51.029 --> 01:10:52.465
I think this is him.

01:10:52.509 --> 01:10:53.466
Roka.

01:10:58.515 --> 01:11:02.736
He did terrible
things in this forest.

01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:04.521
Horrific things.

01:11:04.564 --> 01:11:09.308
And his evil, violent energy,
it seeped into the trees.

01:11:09.352 --> 01:11:13.573
And after he had a house
built with that wood.

01:11:13.617 --> 01:11:15.923
- This is the house, right?

01:11:20.232 --> 01:11:22.365
- More and more
joined Roka's circle

01:11:22.408 --> 01:11:26.151
and over time his
powers grew stronger.

01:11:26.194 --> 01:11:29.328
But his original coven
had expanded too.

01:11:29.372 --> 01:11:32.288
They infiltrated his group
and set a trap for him.

01:11:34.986 --> 01:11:37.031
They knew they needed
to rid the world of Roka

01:11:37.075 --> 01:11:38.337
and his evil.

01:11:38.381 --> 01:11:40.513
Cut the snake off at its head.

01:11:40.557 --> 01:11:42.341
They took his sacred stone.

01:11:42.385 --> 01:11:44.474
It had become as
corrupted with evil energy

01:11:44.517 --> 01:11:48.260
as he was so they forced
him to swallow it.

01:12:01.621 --> 01:12:04.537
Stripped of the power
of his stone, his horns,

01:12:04.581 --> 01:12:09.237
and his own coven, Roka's
reign of evil was finally over.

01:12:12.850 --> 01:12:14.634
These witches, they,
they chopped him up

01:12:14.678 --> 01:12:16.854
into a dozen pieces.

01:12:19.639 --> 01:12:22.555
- Wait, these were
the good witches?

01:12:28.213 --> 01:12:28.953
- Yeah.

01:12:30.302 --> 01:12:33.087
He was buried under the
basement of this house.

01:12:33.131 --> 01:12:35.568
The good witches knew that
he could be unleashed again,

01:12:35.612 --> 01:12:38.832
because of the black
magic that he had used.

01:12:38.876 --> 01:12:41.357
So they painted numbers and
letters all over the walls

01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:44.185
of the house so he wouldn't
have a grasp of language

01:12:44.229 --> 01:12:45.404
right at his fingertips.

01:12:47.188 --> 01:12:51.367
His spirit was trapped
inside of this house.

01:12:51.410 --> 01:12:54.544
One night when we were little,

01:12:54.587 --> 01:12:56.589
my mom told Samantha
and I a story

01:12:56.633 --> 01:12:59.505
about a little girl
who toyed with evil.

01:12:59.549 --> 01:13:01.942
She was interested in
witchcraft and she found out

01:13:01.986 --> 01:13:04.075
about this old house

01:13:04.118 --> 01:13:07.513
that had supernatural
writings on the wall.

01:13:07.557 --> 01:13:09.210
So, of course, she
had to go and try

01:13:09.254 --> 01:13:12.126
and find these
mysterious writings.

01:13:13.258 --> 01:13:15.391
- It's fantastic.

01:13:15.434 --> 01:13:17.784
- She brought a Ouija
board to try and communicate

01:13:17.828 --> 01:13:20.091
but she broke a cardinal rule.

01:13:20.134 --> 01:13:23.616
She played it in a house
with a violent past.

01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:26.445
And I believe she played it
with her sister, Samantha's mom,

01:13:26.489 --> 01:13:29.492
and their childhood
friend, Tomas.

01:13:29.535 --> 01:13:33.365
And the spirit she
contacted was Roka.

01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:35.062
He nearly killed her.

01:13:48.119 --> 01:13:49.381
Samantha's mom

01:13:49.425 --> 01:13:53.167
was never seen again.

01:13:53.211 --> 01:13:54.517
And the other woman?

01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:58.172
She was hurt and she
barely made it out alive.

01:13:58.216 --> 01:13:59.565
I didn't even
realize until tonight

01:13:59.609 --> 01:14:04.135
that the other woman in
the story was my mom.

01:14:04.178 --> 01:14:05.484
She talked about it once

01:14:05.528 --> 01:14:07.747
and then she never
spoke of it again.

01:14:07.791 --> 01:14:09.488
- Okay, so somewhere
along the way your,

01:14:09.532 --> 01:14:12.970
your ancestors gained custody
of this great property.

01:14:13.013 --> 01:14:14.972
Why didn't they
burn the house down?

01:14:15.015 --> 01:14:16.713
Destroy the vessel?

01:14:16.756 --> 01:14:19.106
- The curse got too strong.

01:14:19.150 --> 01:14:20.194
And there were
several other houses

01:14:20.238 --> 01:14:21.979
built from the same wood.

01:14:22.022 --> 01:14:22.936
- Oh.

01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:24.024
More of these fucking places.

01:14:24.068 --> 01:14:25.330
Great.

01:14:25.373 --> 01:14:27.985
- Roka wants to be
free from this house.

01:14:28.028 --> 01:14:32.468
If he wins, he's going to
cross back over into our world.

01:14:32.511 --> 01:14:33.817
- I'm gonna stop you.

01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:35.645
We're talking about
an evil spirit now.

01:14:35.688 --> 01:14:37.951
I thought you didn't believe
in that kind of thing.

01:14:37.995 --> 01:14:40.867
It's not very scientific, is it?

01:14:40.911 --> 01:14:42.782
Are we rethinking that
little theory of yours?

01:14:42.826 --> 01:14:44.480
- Nick, please.

01:14:44.523 --> 01:14:46.786
- Look, open your eyes for
once in your life, Laurie!

01:14:46.830 --> 01:14:48.832
Jesus fucking...

01:14:48.875 --> 01:14:51.356
- What are you talking about?

01:14:51.399 --> 01:14:52.183
- Look.

01:14:54.577 --> 01:14:56.840
I let things happen with Tina.

01:14:56.883 --> 01:14:57.667
Okay?

01:14:59.407 --> 01:15:03.368
I was drunk but I knew
what she was doing.

01:15:03.411 --> 01:15:05.588
And I knew what I was doing.

01:15:05.631 --> 01:15:07.285
And you have every right
to still be mad at me

01:15:07.328 --> 01:15:11.550
but I need you to listen to
what I'm saying right now.

01:15:11.594 --> 01:15:15.598
Sheldon Chartoff, that is the
name of your publisher, right?

01:15:15.641 --> 01:15:18.905
I found that in the
caretaker's pocket.

01:15:18.949 --> 01:15:21.255
He manipulated you, Laurie.

01:15:22.561 --> 01:15:23.823
Somehow he found
out about your plans

01:15:23.867 --> 01:15:26.739
to put this place in your book

01:15:26.783 --> 01:15:28.872
and he couldn't let that happen.

01:15:28.915 --> 01:15:30.569
He wasn't gonna
publish your book.

01:15:30.613 --> 01:15:32.179
He was gonna bury it.

01:15:32.223 --> 01:15:34.094
He knew about the thing
that was in this house.

01:15:34.138 --> 01:15:36.096
I checked his phone.

01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:38.664
He had been talking to your mom.

01:15:38.708 --> 01:15:41.580
I think the two of them were
working together to stop you.

01:15:41.624 --> 01:15:44.365
- Nick, I had to do
something big, okay?

01:15:44.409 --> 01:15:47.064
My mom is losing her house.

01:15:47.107 --> 01:15:51.547
So yeah, I put all my eggs
in one fucking basket.

01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:53.853
I didn't know what
else to do, okay?

01:15:53.897 --> 01:15:56.595
So I guess publishing my book
is completely unrealistic

01:15:56.639 --> 01:15:58.162
and everything that's
happening here,

01:15:58.205 --> 01:16:00.512
it's all my fault, okay?

01:16:00.556 --> 01:16:02.732
Is that what you wanna hear?

01:16:02.775 --> 01:16:05.517
- No, I don't need you
to admit that to me.

01:16:05.561 --> 01:16:09.303
I just need you to
own up to who you are.

01:16:09.347 --> 01:16:12.089
And I need you to figure
out what we're gonna do now.

01:16:12.132 --> 01:16:13.307
- We have to play the game.

01:16:13.351 --> 01:16:15.527
It's our only shot.

01:16:15.571 --> 01:16:16.354
- Please.

01:16:18.095 --> 01:16:20.271
She's had enough.

01:16:20.314 --> 01:16:22.621
All right, it'll kill her.

01:16:22.665 --> 01:16:24.710
- Tomas said there's
no way to win the game.

01:16:24.754 --> 01:16:26.582
There's no way to
get out of here.

01:16:26.625 --> 01:16:28.235
- My mom survived this, okay?

01:16:28.279 --> 01:16:29.628
She had to have
figured out something.

01:16:29.672 --> 01:16:31.630
She contained him.

01:16:38.637 --> 01:16:39.638
- Roka stop!

01:16:39.682 --> 01:16:40.596
We'll play!

01:16:59.832 --> 01:17:00.572
Grab on.

01:17:44.964 --> 01:17:46.531
- What is this?

01:17:46.574 --> 01:17:47.314
What is it?

01:17:47.358 --> 01:17:50.143
- I-S-T-L-E-N.

01:17:50.187 --> 01:17:51.754
- That's, uh, that's listen.

01:17:51.797 --> 01:17:52.537
- Listen.

01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:53.581
- Or silent.

01:17:54.539 --> 01:17:55.975
I can't think of any others.

01:17:56.019 --> 01:17:57.107
- How do we decide?

01:18:00.850 --> 01:18:02.765
- Silent, mother fucker.

01:18:02.808 --> 01:18:04.505
Our answer is silent.

01:18:09.119 --> 01:18:10.598
It was silent.

01:18:10.642 --> 01:18:12.383
It was silent.

01:18:12.426 --> 01:18:13.993
We actually got it right.

01:18:14.037 --> 01:18:14.820
Yeah.

01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:17.562
We actually got it.

01:18:17.605 --> 01:18:18.824
- Nick, wait!

01:18:20.043 --> 01:18:20.783
- Nick!

01:18:25.744 --> 01:18:26.832
- Nick!

01:18:28.268 --> 01:18:29.052
Nick!
- Nick!

01:18:30.183 --> 01:18:31.358
Nick, open the door.

01:18:31.402 --> 01:18:32.925
- Open the door!

01:18:32.969 --> 01:18:33.709
Nick!

01:18:37.147 --> 01:18:38.670
- Nick!

01:18:38.714 --> 01:18:39.453
- Push!

01:18:39.497 --> 01:18:40.280
Laurie!

01:18:40.324 --> 01:18:42.369
- My God!

01:18:43.675 --> 01:18:44.894
- Nick!

01:18:44.937 --> 01:18:45.808
Nick!

01:18:45.851 --> 01:18:46.722
- Come on, Nick.

01:18:46.765 --> 01:18:48.636
- Open up the door!

01:18:54.642 --> 01:18:55.513
Oh, my God.

01:18:58.951 --> 01:19:00.823
Oh my God, baby!

01:19:00.866 --> 01:19:01.737
Oh oh Nick!

01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:04.174
Oh my baby!

01:19:05.305 --> 01:19:06.045
Nick!

01:19:06.089 --> 01:19:07.177
Nick!

01:19:11.398 --> 01:19:12.182
Nick!

01:19:14.793 --> 01:19:15.576
Oh Nick!

01:19:27.153 --> 01:19:28.328
- Come on.

01:19:28.372 --> 01:19:29.808
Come on.

01:19:29.852 --> 01:19:30.809
Come on.

01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:35.814
- Oh Nick!

01:19:58.532 --> 01:19:59.316
- Laurie.

01:20:01.927 --> 01:20:03.537
- My mom beat him.

01:20:04.843 --> 01:20:05.801
We can too.

01:20:06.932 --> 01:20:09.630
We can end this
once and for all.

01:20:10.849 --> 01:20:13.896
- How are we gonna
do that, Laurie?

01:20:13.939 --> 01:20:17.334
- He wants to cross
over into our world.

01:20:17.377 --> 01:20:19.249
That's why he needs us.

01:20:28.736 --> 01:20:29.868
I've seen it before.

01:20:29.912 --> 01:20:30.956
It was in Latin.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.349
- What did it say?

01:20:33.437 --> 01:20:35.091
- It was how to contain him.

01:20:35.134 --> 01:20:37.745
Come on, we have to hurry.

01:20:37.789 --> 01:20:39.051
Try and find some tape.

01:20:39.095 --> 01:20:40.183
- Tape?

01:20:48.234 --> 01:20:48.974
Tape.

01:20:50.193 --> 01:20:51.324
- Did you find any?

01:20:51.368 --> 01:20:52.108
I got it.

01:20:52.151 --> 01:20:52.935
Come on.

01:20:52.978 --> 01:20:53.936
Here.

01:20:57.635 --> 01:20:58.984
- What the fuck!

01:21:00.116 --> 01:21:01.030
Tina.

01:21:04.816 --> 01:21:05.599
Baby.

01:21:07.906 --> 01:21:09.038
- Roka.

01:21:09.081 --> 01:21:10.039
Stop, we'll play.

01:21:10.082 --> 01:21:11.388
One last round!

01:21:17.873 --> 01:21:19.004
- Baby.

01:21:38.067 --> 01:21:39.198
- Tina!

01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:45.422
- L-V-I-E.

01:21:46.466 --> 01:21:47.990
Live.

01:21:48.033 --> 01:21:48.860
- Evil.

01:21:48.904 --> 01:21:49.643
Uh, vile.

01:21:51.819 --> 01:21:52.603
- Veil.

01:21:52.646 --> 01:21:53.734
Jesus Christ.

01:21:54.822 --> 01:21:56.346
- We gotta pick one.

01:21:57.260 --> 01:21:59.653
- Tina, listen to me.

01:21:59.697 --> 01:22:00.959
It's gonna be okay.

01:22:01.003 --> 01:22:01.873
All right?

01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:03.527
You're gonna live through this.

01:22:03.570 --> 01:22:04.920
You hear me?

01:22:04.963 --> 01:22:06.399
You piece of shit.

01:22:06.443 --> 01:22:08.010
That's my answer.

01:22:08.053 --> 01:22:08.836
Live!

01:22:10.577 --> 01:22:11.361
It's live.

01:22:13.319 --> 01:22:15.104
I love you, baby.

01:22:15.147 --> 01:22:17.106
You, you hear me, honey?

01:22:35.515 --> 01:22:37.213
- Shit, we got it wrong.

01:22:37.256 --> 01:22:38.040
- Now!

01:23:04.718 --> 01:23:05.981
- No.

01:23:06.024 --> 01:23:06.764
Laurie!

01:23:06.807 --> 01:23:07.591
Get the A!

01:23:26.088 --> 01:23:28.090
- His name was Roka.

01:23:28.133 --> 01:23:30.918
By this name shall
he be released.

01:23:34.096 --> 01:23:36.011
And so shall he find them.

01:23:46.238 --> 01:23:47.022
Spence!

01:23:50.677 --> 01:23:52.462
Spence, we did it.

01:23:52.505 --> 01:23:53.593
- Laurie, oh.

01:23:56.596 --> 01:23:58.424
I thought I wasn't
gonna see you any more.

01:23:58.468 --> 01:24:00.774
Went out to the shed for a
while and then, broke him...

01:24:00.818 --> 01:24:04.039
No!

01:24:15.267 --> 01:24:16.051
- Bravo.

01:24:18.270 --> 01:24:19.271
- No.

01:24:20.577 --> 01:24:22.013
No, you're not, you're not real.

01:24:22.057 --> 01:24:23.841
You're not real.

01:24:23.884 --> 01:24:26.409
- That's what I keep
trying to tell you, Laurie.

01:24:26.452 --> 01:24:28.672
None of it's real.

01:24:28.715 --> 01:24:32.850
Your whole world's been
one big goddamn illusion.

01:24:32.893 --> 01:24:35.983
But yet you keep falling
for the same tricks

01:24:36.027 --> 01:24:37.594
over and over again.

01:24:40.031 --> 01:24:42.425
Oh, poor little Laurie.

01:24:42.468 --> 01:24:45.428
Always trying to
do the right thing

01:24:45.471 --> 01:24:50.041
but yet too afraid to do
the hard work it takes.

01:24:50.085 --> 01:24:53.218
- How are you even
here right now?

01:24:53.262 --> 01:24:55.264
- You brought me here.

01:24:55.307 --> 01:24:56.308
Remember?

01:24:57.179 --> 01:24:58.876
All of this is you.

01:25:00.834 --> 01:25:05.274
- This isn't real.

01:25:24.031 --> 01:25:25.816
- Laurie, please stop.

01:25:29.602 --> 01:25:31.561
- I know you're not you.

01:25:32.605 --> 01:25:34.955
I know you're not in control.

01:25:34.999 --> 01:25:37.697
I knew it then
and I know it now.

01:25:37.741 --> 01:25:38.524
It's okay.

01:25:48.621 --> 01:25:50.797
I hope you can forgive me.

01:26:20.218 --> 01:26:23.482
- No!

01:26:26.224 --> 01:26:28.313
You have no control here!

01:26:39.890 --> 01:26:40.978
I'm so sorry.

01:26:42.458 --> 01:26:44.721
I hope you can forgive me?

01:27:45.782 --> 01:27:48.828
- Is that the best
you've got, lover?

01:27:51.266 --> 01:27:52.049
- How?

01:27:55.095 --> 01:27:55.835
Please don't do this, Tina.

01:28:08.674 --> 01:28:09.458
Tina.

01:28:56.505 --> 01:28:57.462
- What do you think
of our anniversary?

01:28:57.506 --> 01:28:58.420
- Our anniversary.

01:29:00.813 --> 01:29:01.553
- Where's my...

01:29:01.597 --> 01:29:02.685
There it is.

01:29:02.728 --> 01:29:06.123
Cheers!

01:29:08.430 --> 01:29:10.432
Now, why is your hair that way?

01:29:10.475 --> 01:29:12.564
your hair that way.

01:29:20.790 --> 01:29:21.530
- Oh.

01:29:21.573 --> 01:29:22.487
- Oh, sorry, Laurie.

01:29:22.531 --> 01:29:23.575
Jeez.

01:29:23.619 --> 01:29:24.402
- Oh, Spence.

01:29:25.795 --> 01:29:26.578
- Oh.

01:29:28.841 --> 01:29:30.103
How you been?

01:29:30.147 --> 01:29:31.061
- Um, good.

01:29:32.454 --> 01:29:34.064
I, I've been good.

01:29:35.108 --> 01:29:37.502
I've been writing every day.

01:29:38.895 --> 01:29:40.200
Except for I'm not
actually writing

01:29:40.244 --> 01:29:43.465
to pay my bills of
course.

01:29:43.508 --> 01:29:44.466
How are you?

01:29:45.902 --> 01:29:48.470
- One day at a time, you know?

01:29:50.297 --> 01:29:51.081
- Yeah.

01:29:54.432 --> 01:29:55.215
Spence?

01:29:58.523 --> 01:30:01.396
They're still asking questions.

01:30:01.439 --> 01:30:03.528
- You and I have been cleared.

01:30:03.572 --> 01:30:05.095
We survived a killing spree.

01:30:05.138 --> 01:30:07.140
That's all they need to know.

01:30:07.184 --> 01:30:09.926
- It just doesn't seem fair
that they're blaming Tomas.

01:30:09.969 --> 01:30:11.623
- Let the police
think what they want.

01:30:11.667 --> 01:30:14.060
You got a second chance, Laurie.

01:30:14.104 --> 01:30:15.584
Take it.

01:30:15.627 --> 01:30:18.369
It's what they
would've wanted for us.

01:30:18.413 --> 01:30:19.196
- Yeah.

01:30:20.589 --> 01:30:22.504
Yeah, you're right.

01:30:22.547 --> 01:30:24.723
- Of course I'm right.

01:30:24.767 --> 01:30:26.551
How's your mom?

01:30:26.595 --> 01:30:27.900
- She's doing better.

01:30:27.944 --> 01:30:29.511
Better and better, actually.

01:30:29.554 --> 01:30:33.297
The doctors say that it
was just a mild seizure.

01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:35.517
Now I'm just excited
to see her find out

01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:37.257
that we actually get
to keep the house.

01:30:37.301 --> 01:30:39.390
- All thanks to you.

01:30:39.434 --> 01:30:42.480
- Spence, I really wanna thank
you about offering the loan.

01:30:42.524 --> 01:30:43.307
It was really thoughtful.

01:30:43.350 --> 01:30:44.613
It was.

01:30:44.656 --> 01:30:46.092
It's just, you know,
working two jobs for me,

01:30:46.136 --> 01:30:47.920
it's not gonna be, it's
not gonna be that bad.

01:30:47.964 --> 01:30:52.142
It builds character,
calluses, and fatigue.

01:30:53.796 --> 01:30:54.927
- That it will do.

01:30:54.971 --> 01:30:55.711
For sure.

01:31:00.803 --> 01:31:02.587
- All right?

01:31:02.631 --> 01:31:03.980
All right?

01:31:04.023 --> 01:31:05.024
- Thank you.

01:31:09.725 --> 01:31:11.422
You done good, honey.

01:31:12.945 --> 01:31:14.947
You done real good.

01:32:36.376 --> 01:32:37.160
- Mom?

01:32:43.383 --> 01:32:44.167
Mom?
