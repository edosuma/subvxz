WEBVTT

00:04.838 --> 00:08.008
My name is Bridget.
I witnessed a murder.

00:08.049 --> 00:09.551
Just get up
on the stand

00:09.592 --> 00:10.885
and tell the judge
what you saw.

00:10.927 --> 00:12.262
And we'll
protect you.

00:12.303 --> 00:13.513
BRIDGET: You don't get it.

00:13.555 --> 00:15.932
If Bodaway wants me dead,
I'm dead.

00:15.974 --> 00:18.268
I ran to my sister Siobhan
for help.

00:18.309 --> 00:20.770
Siobhan killed herself,
and I assumed her identity.

00:20.812 --> 00:22.272
It was so easy.

00:22.313 --> 00:23.523
I saw a way out,
and I took it.

00:23.565 --> 00:26.109
They all think that I'm her.

00:26.151 --> 00:28.361
Martin/Charles is running
a Ponzi scheme.

00:28.403 --> 00:31.031
Freeze it.

00:31.072 --> 00:32.323
Andrew Martin will kill
anyone he has to

00:32.365 --> 00:33.533
to keep his secret safe.

00:33.575 --> 00:34.909
I made her
believe I killed myself.

00:34.951 --> 00:36.161
Siobhan, that's insane.

00:36.202 --> 00:37.787
I wanted
him to kill Bridget,

00:37.829 --> 00:39.080
thinking she was me.

00:39.122 --> 00:40.957
When did you realize
I wasn't Siobhan?

00:40.999 --> 00:42.709
I knew something was
off from the beginning.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.252
Malcolm never showed.

00:44.294 --> 00:45.503
I told him to turn
himself in last night.

00:45.545 --> 00:46.921
He was going to testify
against Bodaway.

00:46.963 --> 00:48.631
The Ponzi scheme
wasn't Olivia's idea.

00:48.673 --> 00:49.883
It was mine.

00:49.924 --> 00:51.593
Are you leaving?

00:51.634 --> 00:53.303
Just for a few days.

00:53.344 --> 00:54.512
I love you, Siobhan.

00:54.554 --> 00:56.723
[gunshots]

00:56.765 --> 00:58.183
FBI! Drop it

00:59.851 --> 01:01.436
Andrew, hang in there.

01:01.478 --> 01:02.854
SOLOMON: He was shot

01:02.896 --> 01:05.190
just below the clavicle,
no exit wound.

01:05.231 --> 01:06.983
MACHADO: Looks like the bullet
might have hit an artery.

01:07.025 --> 01:08.568
We don't have much time.

01:08.610 --> 01:10.987
SOLOMON: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's 414 Warren Street.

01:11.029 --> 01:13.239
OK, just-just hurry.
Ambulance is on its way.

01:13.281 --> 01:14.699
He jumped in front
of the bullet?

01:14.741 --> 01:15.950
He saved
my life.

01:15.992 --> 01:17.160
What direction
did it come from?

01:17.202 --> 01:18.828
Right
over there.

01:18.870 --> 01:20.955
All right, keep pressure.

01:20.997 --> 01:23.583
MACHADO: Where's
that flashlight? Right.

01:31.549 --> 01:33.009
FBI! Freeze!

01:35.595 --> 01:37.013
Andrew.

01:37.055 --> 01:39.224
-Still down there.
-I'll come with you.

01:39.265 --> 01:40.433
No, wait here
with them.

01:50.068 --> 01:51.569
FBI! Freeze!

01:51.611 --> 01:53.655
Freeze!

01:53.696 --> 01:55.198
Toss your weapon
down to the ground!

01:55.240 --> 01:56.616
Hands on your head.
Spread your legs!

01:56.658 --> 01:59.244
Toss your weapon down
to the ground now!

01:59.285 --> 02:00.703
[excited chattering]

02:04.165 --> 02:06.376
MACHADO: Don't move.

02:45.415 --> 02:47.250
[sirens approaching]

03:05.143 --> 03:07.103
[indistinct announcements
over P.A.]

03:11.149 --> 03:12.942
What happened?

03:12.984 --> 03:14.485
[sobbing softly]

03:16.362 --> 03:19.115
Your dad saved my life.

03:19.157 --> 03:20.325
[sniffles]

03:20.366 --> 03:21.576
A man tried to shoot me,

03:21.618 --> 03:23.244
and your dad jumped

03:23.286 --> 03:24.579
in front of the bullet.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.998
Can I... can I see him?

03:27.040 --> 03:29.000
He's in surgery right now.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.252
It's gonna be a few hours
before we know anything.

03:31.294 --> 03:32.462
I don't understand.

03:32.503 --> 03:33.963
What did you do?

03:34.005 --> 03:35.757
Why is someone
trying to hurt you?

03:38.051 --> 03:40.553
I don't know, Juliet.

03:40.595 --> 03:43.306
I don't.

03:43.348 --> 03:44.349
Oh, my God.

03:46.392 --> 03:48.811
What if Daddy dies?

03:53.983 --> 03:55.818
[phone ringing]

03:59.072 --> 04:01.157
[sighs]

04:04.619 --> 04:06.829
Hello.

04:06.871 --> 04:08.039
Juliet?

04:09.624 --> 04:12.752
It's the middle
of the night.

04:14.003 --> 04:16.047
What? Where?

04:16.089 --> 04:18.466
[whispers]
What is it?

04:18.508 --> 04:20.843
No, uh, it's OK.
I'll come.

04:20.885 --> 04:23.429
Yeah, no. I can get
someone to watch them.

04:23.471 --> 04:25.056
Yeah, OK, OK.

04:27.141 --> 04:31.688
Um... there was
a shooting in the loft.

04:31.729 --> 04:33.815
Bridget?

04:33.856 --> 04:35.441
No. Andrew.

04:35.483 --> 04:37.694
-Andrew? What happened?
-I don't know.

04:37.735 --> 04:39.570
But Juliet asked me
to go to your place

04:39.612 --> 04:41.447
and pick up
a few things.

04:47.328 --> 04:49.080
[phones ringing]

04:54.335 --> 04:55.712
Hey, thanks.

04:55.753 --> 04:57.630
Figure it out yet?

04:57.672 --> 04:59.215
Yeah, Tower card.

04:59.257 --> 05:01.884
Uh, in some cultures,
it symbolizes failure

05:01.926 --> 05:04.387
or ruin, like Tower
of Babel burning down.

05:04.429 --> 05:06.806
And then to others,
it represents dualism

05:06.848 --> 05:09.142
smashing into separate,
opposing sides.

05:09.183 --> 05:11.394
Any idea why our hit man
was carrying it?

05:11.436 --> 05:12.979
Not a clue.

05:13.021 --> 05:15.023
I've always thought that
stuff was a bunch of crap.

05:15.064 --> 05:17.025
I got my palm read once;
she said I'd be dead at 36.

05:17.066 --> 05:18.484
How old are you?

05:18.526 --> 05:20.153
Thirty-five.

05:20.194 --> 05:22.280
Yeah, lose my invite to
your next birthday party.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.449
I take it the BOLO
hasn't turned anything up

05:24.490 --> 05:26.367
on our hit man's
whereabouts?

05:26.409 --> 05:28.328
He's in Canada by now.

05:28.369 --> 05:30.121
I'm sure he had clothes
stashed somewhere,

05:30.163 --> 05:32.040
and two minutes later, he was
looking like everybody else.

05:32.081 --> 05:33.708
We're not going to get
anywhere looking for him.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.251
Let's just think about
this for a second.

05:35.293 --> 05:37.879
All right, Tyler Barrett,

05:37.920 --> 05:39.380
Martin/Charles' head
of European operations

05:39.422 --> 05:40.757
turned whistle-blower,

05:40.798 --> 05:42.258
is found dead
in his hotel room.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.469
OK, next day,
another employee,

05:44.510 --> 05:46.137
Malcolm Ward,
goes missing,

05:46.179 --> 05:48.264
right before he was
supposed to testify

05:48.306 --> 05:50.266
against Bodaway Macawi.

05:50.308 --> 05:51.768
Then the shooting
of Andrew Martin.

05:51.809 --> 05:54.020
I mean, what is going
on at Martin/Charles?

05:54.062 --> 05:56.064
SEC's got to be down
their throats by now, right?

05:56.105 --> 05:57.690
Talked to Lanfair
over there yesterday.

05:57.732 --> 05:59.484
He said they're putting
the Martin/Charles case

05:59.525 --> 06:01.152
on the back burner.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.653
What the hell for?

06:02.695 --> 06:04.155
Without Tyler Barrett,
they have no evidence.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.240
Just gonna wait for Homicide
to dig up a lead

06:06.282 --> 06:07.700
and point them
in the right direction.

06:07.742 --> 06:09.202
No, no. What's with
these people?

06:09.243 --> 06:10.661
Isn't a growing
body count

06:10.703 --> 06:12.163
enough to keep looking
into their business?

06:12.205 --> 06:14.207
Guess they don't have
the manpower.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.668
All right, well, maybe
you can figure out

06:17.710 --> 06:19.170
why our hit man
was carrying that.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.506
And I'll try and focus
on how my missing witness,

06:21.547 --> 06:23.591
Malcolm Ward, got
mixed up in this mess,

06:23.633 --> 06:25.093
and, hopefully,
we'll get

06:25.134 --> 06:26.552
some answers
from Andrew Martin,

06:26.594 --> 06:28.596
if he's still alive.

06:34.769 --> 06:36.187
Henry?

06:36.229 --> 06:38.898
Uh, Juliet called me.

06:38.940 --> 06:42.193
She thought you might want
some stuff from your house.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.569
Thank you.

06:43.611 --> 06:44.779
Yeah.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.072
Do you need anything else?

06:46.114 --> 06:47.698
Want a cup of coffee
or something?

06:47.740 --> 06:49.617
I'm OK.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.619
There's nothing really to
do right now except wait.

06:51.661 --> 06:52.829
OK.

06:56.207 --> 06:57.959
How is he?

07:00.378 --> 07:02.547
I don't know.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.215
He's, um,

07:04.257 --> 07:06.968
been in surgery
for two hours.

07:07.009 --> 07:09.137
The bullet
fragmented,

07:09.178 --> 07:11.347
and a piece of it is

07:11.389 --> 07:13.433
really close
to his spine.

07:13.474 --> 07:15.601
[sighs]

07:15.643 --> 07:17.395
How did it happen?

07:17.437 --> 07:20.731
[sniffles]

07:20.773 --> 07:22.775
Someone tried
to shoot me,

07:22.817 --> 07:25.194
and Andrew saved me.

07:25.236 --> 07:27.905
Andrew saved you?

07:30.741 --> 07:33.494
Who would want to shoot you?

07:33.536 --> 07:35.288
I don't know.

07:39.417 --> 07:41.919
Well, Andrew's a fighter.

07:41.961 --> 07:45.590
He's going to pull
through this, I know it.

07:49.093 --> 07:50.261
Juliet.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.471
Hmm?

07:51.512 --> 07:52.805
Doctor.

07:55.808 --> 07:58.227
He did great.

07:58.269 --> 08:00.605
We were able to remove
the bullet fragments

08:00.646 --> 08:03.274
close to the severed artery
without any nerve damage.

08:03.316 --> 08:06.360
Your husband's
going to be fine.

08:06.402 --> 08:07.862
[sniffles]

08:07.904 --> 08:10.031
Oh, thank you.

08:18.039 --> 08:19.499
It's been four hours.

08:19.540 --> 08:21.042
An update would've
been nice.

08:21.083 --> 08:24.212
Are you gonna tell me
what happened?

08:25.254 --> 08:26.422
Is Andrew alive?

08:26.464 --> 08:28.007
Yes.

08:28.049 --> 08:29.425
Do they know
who shot him?

08:29.467 --> 08:32.053
Police lost him in a crowd.

08:32.094 --> 08:34.639
So the person that he hired
to kill me shot at him?

08:34.680 --> 08:36.849
Well, the bullet
was intended for you,

08:36.891 --> 08:38.935
Siobhan, just like
you said it would be.

08:38.976 --> 08:41.270
But the twist
you didn't see coming:

08:41.312 --> 08:43.564
Andrew jumped
in front of it.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.274
He saved Bridget's life.

08:48.319 --> 08:50.655
Guess Andrew
changed his mind.

08:50.696 --> 08:52.615
Why would he put a hit
out on his wife

08:52.657 --> 08:54.325
and then change his mind?

08:54.367 --> 08:56.035
Because somehow
my bitch sister

08:56.077 --> 08:57.620
made him fall
in love with her.

08:57.662 --> 08:58.913
You know what?
You're right.

08:58.955 --> 09:00.122
They are in love.

09:00.164 --> 09:01.582
Because it seems like
without you,

09:01.624 --> 09:03.167
your family is tighter
than ever.

09:03.209 --> 09:07.463
Now, here's another theory
about what happened:

09:07.505 --> 09:09.924
Andrew was never
going to kill you.

09:09.966 --> 09:12.093
You just told me that
so I'd never find out

09:12.134 --> 09:14.345
who the real murderer is.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.681
I think you put a hit
out on Bridget,

09:16.722 --> 09:18.224
and you've been trying
to frame Andrew all along.

09:18.266 --> 09:19.433
That's insane.

09:19.475 --> 09:21.060
The only thing insane
is believing

09:21.102 --> 09:22.979
a word you've said.

09:23.020 --> 09:25.022
You really think that?

09:25.064 --> 09:27.775
I think you're a liar
and a sociopath.

09:27.817 --> 09:30.236
Henry, I love you.

09:30.278 --> 09:31.904
Everything
that I've done

09:31.946 --> 09:33.364
is for us,
for our children.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.907
Who the hell even knows

09:34.949 --> 09:36.701
if those babies
are mine, Siobhan?

09:36.742 --> 09:38.327
I want you to leave.

09:38.369 --> 09:40.288
Can we at least
talk about this?

09:40.329 --> 09:42.456
No, no, no, no. We are
beyond talking about this.

09:42.498 --> 09:44.709
I want you to get
out of my house, Siobhan.

10:10.693 --> 10:12.028
Hey, Superman.

10:12.069 --> 10:14.155
[groans weakly]

10:15.698 --> 10:18.743
You remember what happened?

10:18.784 --> 10:20.661
Did they catch the gunman?

10:20.703 --> 10:23.914
Not yet.

10:23.956 --> 10:27.543
What about you and I?

10:27.585 --> 10:28.753
Are we...?

10:35.760 --> 10:37.386
I'm coming home.

10:37.428 --> 10:39.430
Good.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.432
I missed you.

10:46.437 --> 10:49.398
Andrew, I don't want
to upset you, but...

10:49.440 --> 10:51.359
I have to ask.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.194
Why were you at
Malcolm's hotel room

10:53.235 --> 10:55.780
the other night?

10:55.821 --> 10:58.407
I saw the surveillance
footage.

11:01.243 --> 11:03.996
It was Olivia's idea.

11:04.038 --> 11:07.792
She was worried
Malcolm knew too much.

11:07.833 --> 11:10.961
and she wanted to offer him
money to keep quiet.

11:11.003 --> 11:13.297
You bribed him?

11:13.339 --> 11:15.549
I shouldn't have
listened to her,

11:15.591 --> 11:18.594
but I didn't know
what else to do.

11:18.636 --> 11:21.889
Olivia thought he might try
to take down the company.

11:23.516 --> 11:26.352
Did he take the money?

11:26.394 --> 11:29.021
Hmm.

11:29.063 --> 11:31.607
And he deserved
every penny,

11:31.649 --> 11:33.234

11:33.275 --> 11:35.486

11:40.533 --> 11:42.868
You have to understand.

11:42.910 --> 11:45.621
I was acting out of fear,

11:45.663 --> 11:47.623
following Olivia's demands.

11:47.665 --> 11:49.166
I'm so sorry, Siobhan.

11:50.918 --> 11:53.796
I should've been honest with
you from the beginning.

11:53.838 --> 11:56.048
It's OK.

11:57.883 --> 12:01.137
I haven't exactly been
honest with you, either.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.974
You remember
the investor party

12:05.015 --> 12:06.809

had at the loft?

12:06.851 --> 12:09.186

12:09.228 --> 12:12.523

financial free-fall, yeah.

12:14.316 --> 12:16.068
Well, um...
the night before,

12:16.110 --> 12:17.862
I was supposed to meet
Gemma at the loft.

12:19.697 --> 12:21.574
But before she got there,

12:21.615 --> 12:24.326
someone tried to kill me.

12:26.162 --> 12:28.080
What?

12:28.122 --> 12:30.374
He was wearing
a ski mask.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.668
He had a crowbar,
and, um...

12:33.836 --> 12:36.005
I killed him.

Oh, my God.

12:42.344 --> 12:44.764
How come I didn't hear...?

12:44.805 --> 12:47.308
Because the body
disappeared.

12:47.349 --> 12:50.060
I have no idea
who took it.

12:50.102 --> 12:54.315
And I was too scared
to tell anyone.

12:54.356 --> 12:56.442
Why didn't you tell me?

12:58.569 --> 13:00.529
Because...

13:00.571 --> 13:03.199
I wasn't sure that
you weren't involved.

13:05.743 --> 13:07.703
Are you serious?

13:11.582 --> 13:15.544
That time I threatened you,
I didn't really mean it.

13:16.754 --> 13:19.131
Even in our darkest
hours, Siobhan,

13:19.173 --> 13:20.925
I would never do
anything like that.

13:20.966 --> 13:23.552
You have to believe me.

After what you did
last night, I do.

13:26.555 --> 13:28.140
But I also know

13:28.182 --> 13:30.309
that Malcolm didn't
send me that text.

13:30.351 --> 13:32.520
Andrew, was Olivia aware

13:32.561 --> 13:34.355
that I knew what was going
on at Martin/Charles?

13:34.396 --> 13:36.023
Yeah.

13:36.065 --> 13:39.151
We decided I would handle
you and Malcolm

13:39.193 --> 13:41.987
and she would take care
of Tyler Barrett.

Tyler Barrett?"

one is missing,

your secret, Andrew.

Listen, Tim, I
didn't just call you

14:33.205 --> 14:34.665

for the weekend.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.333
I, um...

14:36.375 --> 14:38.294
I was up all
last night, thinking.

14:38.335 --> 14:40.212
About...?

14:40.254 --> 14:41.755
Family.

14:41.797 --> 14:44.842
It's what's
important, right?

14:44.884 --> 14:46.635
Most important thing.

14:46.677 --> 14:48.637
And, uh...

14:48.679 --> 14:51.974
just because Gemma's
not around anymore,

14:52.016 --> 14:54.184
it doesn't mean that
we're not family.

14:54.226 --> 14:57.646
I told you, son,
we'll always be family.

15:00.065 --> 15:02.401
Which is why
I need to tell you this.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.820
I think you need
to pull your investment

15:04.862 --> 15:07.114

Oh, I'm OK. Thank you.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.776
Why were you at
Malcolm Ward's hotel

15:43.817 --> 15:46.612
two days ago?

15:46.654 --> 15:48.447
When I spoke with you
and Ms. Charles,

15:48.489 --> 15:50.282
you specifically said
you hadn't seen him

15:50.324 --> 15:51.784
since he was fired.

15:51.825 --> 15:53.285
And then I learned

15:53.327 --> 15:55.287
that somebody
fitting your description

15:55.329 --> 15:56.914
was asking to see
surveillance video

15:56.956 --> 15:58.457
from Malcolm's hotel.

15:58.499 --> 16:01.752
Well, Malcolm had become
a friend of ours.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.463
And I was concerned for his
whereabouts, just like you.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.548
After we spoke,

16:06.590 --> 16:08.467
I decided
to look for him myself.

16:08.509 --> 16:11.345
When the hotel desk clerk
told me he'd checked out,

16:11.387 --> 16:13.305
I wondered
if the surveillance video

16:13.347 --> 16:15.015
might clue us
into something.

16:15.057 --> 16:18.268
So you--you didn't try
and, uh, retrieve the tapes

16:18.310 --> 16:20.771

like, maybe me,

16:20.813 --> 16:22.523

that you were

16:22.564 --> 16:24.191

16:24.233 --> 16:28.862
If anything, I was trying
to help you find him..

16:28.904 --> 16:31.615
Did you know Malcolm was
on his way to the FBI

16:31.657 --> 16:33.242
to testify against
Bodaway Macawi?

16:33.283 --> 16:34.785
Excuse me?

16:34.827 --> 16:36.745

about his kidnapping

from him since.

gone unanswered.

16:51.969 --> 16:53.554
Why?

16:53.595 --> 16:56.140
Well, I think
it's pretty clear that

16:56.181 --> 16:58.559
someone's targeting people
at Martin/Charles,

16:58.600 --> 17:00.352

22:59.294 --> 23:00.796
Listen, I told you
that what happened

23:00.837 --> 23:02.714
with Tessa had
to happen.

23:02.756 --> 23:04.007
I wasn't about to let her
blow the entire plan.

23:04.049 --> 23:05.467
So you
better cool your jets

23:05.509 --> 23:06.802
and get over
yourself, little lady,

23:06.843 --> 23:08.929
because what we did
bonds us forever,

23:08.970 --> 23:10.514
whether you
like it or not.

23:10.555 --> 23:13.600
So I suggest
you get used to it.

23:25.904 --> 23:28.532
SIOBHAN:
Henry, it's Siobhan.

23:28.573 --> 23:30.325
You're right.

23:30.367 --> 23:33.203
I've told too many lies.

23:33.245 --> 23:37.082
Things got out of control, and
I didn't know what else to do.

23:37.124 --> 23:39.167
But I promise you,

23:39.209 --> 23:42.629
I did not hire someone
to kill Bridget.

23:42.671 --> 23:44.339
And I never lied
about loving you.

23:46.341 --> 23:49.177
And that's why
I'm going to the hospital

23:49.219 --> 23:52.180
to tell Andrew the truth

23:52.222 --> 23:54.599
about everything.

23:54.641 --> 23:57.352
None of this mess means anything
if we're not together.

24:12.033 --> 24:14.369
Hey.

24:14.411 --> 24:17.289
I, uh... stopped
at Bergdorf's

24:17.330 --> 24:18.999
on my way
from the hospital.

24:19.040 --> 24:21.042
Picked up something
for Miami.

24:23.003 --> 24:24.588
Thanks.

24:27.841 --> 24:29.342
BRIDGET: What's
with all the wool?

24:29.384 --> 24:30.886
You know it's,
like, 80 degrees

24:30.927 --> 24:32.512
in Miami right now?

24:32.554 --> 24:34.014
People wear scarves when
it's warm out all the time.

24:34.055 --> 24:35.765
It's called fashion, Siobhan.

24:35.807 --> 24:37.601
I guess I should've
gotten you

24:37.642 --> 24:39.853
those cute
moon boots I saw.

24:41.730 --> 24:44.774
Juliet, come on.
It's just temporary.

24:44.816 --> 24:46.693
Hopefully, it won't be
more than a few weeks.

24:46.735 --> 24:48.528
Yeah, but you guys keep
bouncing me back and forth

24:48.570 --> 24:50.238
like I'm a ping-pong ball.

24:50.280 --> 24:51.823
And I remember you said that
I'm the collateral damage

24:51.865 --> 24:53.366
in a war between my parents.

24:53.408 --> 24:55.452
And, frankly,
I'm sick of it.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.120
I said that?

24:57.162 --> 24:58.413
Yes.

24:58.455 --> 25:00.415
Juliet, your
father almost died

25:00.457 --> 25:02.292
the other night.

25:02.334 --> 25:03.793
OK? This is serious.

25:03.835 --> 25:05.170
It's not safe here.

25:05.212 --> 25:07.005
And you're not
collateral damage.

25:07.047 --> 25:09.049
You're precious goods

25:09.090 --> 25:11.134
that we'll do anything
we can to protect.

25:13.094 --> 25:17.349
I know that your mom's
not... the easiest.

25:17.390 --> 25:20.060
But putting up with
a little tension

25:20.101 --> 25:22.521
to avoid a bullet
is worth it.

25:22.562 --> 25:25.065
There are bullets
in Miami, too.

25:34.699 --> 25:36.535
Traveling light, I see.

25:36.576 --> 25:38.662
I have what I need.

25:42.415 --> 25:44.209
BRIDGET: You know you
can call us anytime,

25:44.251 --> 25:45.460
day or night?

25:45.502 --> 25:47.587
Yeah, do me a favor, Siobhan?

25:47.629 --> 25:49.256
Anything.

25:49.297 --> 25:50.924
Lose my number.

25:55.971 --> 25:58.306
Hey, ladies.

25:58.348 --> 26:00.475
Can we stop by my school
on the way to the airport?

26:00.517 --> 26:03.144
There are just a few people
I want to say bye to.

26:03.186 --> 26:05.272
OK. But we're
not staying long.

26:05.313 --> 26:07.274
Might need a drink
before takeoff.

26:07.315 --> 26:08.942
[indistinct chatter]

26:12.362 --> 26:13.905
[camera buzzes]

26:24.874 --> 26:26.501
SIOBHAN:
Henry, it's Siobhan.

26:26.543 --> 26:27.711
You're right.

26:27.752 --> 26:30.171
I've told too many lies.

26:30.213 --> 26:34.342
Things got out of control, and
I didn't know what else to do.

26:36.344 --> 26:37.512
[siren pulses]

26:37.554 --> 26:39.139
[bell rings]

26:42.559 --> 26:44.144
Hi.

26:44.185 --> 26:45.937
May I help you?

26:45.979 --> 26:48.315
Yeah, I'm looking
for Remy Osterman.

26:48.356 --> 26:50.734
Sorry. He's not in today.
May I give him a message?

26:53.778 --> 26:56.239
Recognize this?

26:56.281 --> 26:57.782
The Tower card.

26:57.824 --> 26:59.743
Always thought this was
the spookiest one,

26:59.784 --> 27:01.161
even spookier than
the Death card.

27:01.202 --> 27:02.829
So it's one of yours?

27:02.871 --> 27:04.414
You do
tarot readings here?

27:04.456 --> 27:06.583
There used to be a woman
who did readings on the side.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.126
My boss liked the cards,

27:08.168 --> 27:09.544
so he gave them out
as coupons.

27:09.586 --> 27:11.880
You know, free shirt
cleaning, stuff like that,

27:11.921 --> 27:13.548
but she died
about a year ago,

27:13.590 --> 27:15.342
and we stopped
the promotion.

27:15.383 --> 27:17.385
It's a little weird--

27:17.427 --> 27:19.387
using a tarot card
as a coupon.

27:19.429 --> 27:20.972
I mean, look--

27:21.014 --> 27:23.350
name and the location
of the cleaners

27:23.391 --> 27:25.185
is not on it anywhere.

27:25.226 --> 27:27.687
It was my boss's thing,
not mine.

27:27.729 --> 27:31.232
And your boss
is Remy Osterman?

27:31.274 --> 27:32.984
When's he gonna be in?

27:33.026 --> 27:36.571
You know, he doesn't
give me his schedule.

27:36.613 --> 27:39.199
Well, uh,
let him know

27:39.240 --> 27:41.534
the FBI would like
to speak with him.

27:43.244 --> 27:44.579
Mind if I keep this,

27:44.621 --> 27:46.206
you know,
as a souvenir?

27:52.629 --> 27:54.089
[bell rings]

28:00.845 --> 28:02.931
The card just came in,

28:02.972 --> 28:06.017
courtesy of FBI Agent...

28:06.059 --> 28:07.936
Victor Machado.

28:09.521 --> 28:11.606
Hey, I want
records of everyone

28:11.648 --> 28:13.525
who's ever worked
at Finer Dry Cleaners.

28:13.566 --> 28:15.026
I want to know
how much they pay in taxes,

28:15.068 --> 28:17.404
where they have lunch, what
kind of starch they use.

28:17.445 --> 28:19.489
They're hiding something;
and we're going to find it.

28:21.449 --> 28:23.451
[indistinct PA announcements]

28:47.517 --> 28:49.644
Hi.

28:49.686 --> 28:51.354
Hello, Andrew.

28:54.691 --> 28:56.067
Hold on a second.

28:56.109 --> 28:57.652
Um, I'm a friend
of the family's.

28:57.694 --> 28:58.862
Spread your arms
and legs, please.

28:58.903 --> 29:00.864
[sighs]
Come on.

29:06.703 --> 29:08.037
Siobhan.

29:08.079 --> 29:10.248
Can we talk?

29:10.290 --> 29:12.667
Henry.

29:12.709 --> 29:14.794
Andrew.
How you feeling, pal?

29:14.836 --> 29:16.463
Better, thanks.

29:16.504 --> 29:17.964
HENRY: That's good.

29:18.006 --> 29:19.424
I'm glad you're
feeling better.

29:19.466 --> 29:21.259
Hey, uh, can I steal
your wife for a second?

29:23.178 --> 29:24.846
Sure.

29:24.888 --> 29:26.598
[cell phone ringing]

29:33.772 --> 29:36.649
You didn't tell Andrew
the truth, did you?

29:36.691 --> 29:37.859
I want it to end, Henry.

29:37.901 --> 29:39.277
I wish
it never started.

29:39.319 --> 29:40.779
I wish we could
just go back nine months

29:40.820 --> 29:42.155
and just be sleeping
with each other

29:42.197 --> 29:43.364
behind everybody's back.

29:43.406 --> 29:45.325
It was a lot easier
than all this.

29:45.366 --> 29:46.910
Then let me go back
in there and tell him.

29:46.951 --> 29:48.703
We'll just start over
somewhere.

29:48.745 --> 29:50.246
I believe you.
I didn't at first.

29:50.288 --> 29:51.831
I figured that you
were just crying wolf

29:51.873 --> 29:53.541
or pulling strings,
but I never imagined

29:53.583 --> 29:55.418
that you'd be willing
to throw it all away.

29:55.460 --> 29:57.128
How many times
do I have to tell you that

29:57.170 --> 29:59.464
none of this means anything
if we can't be together?

30:01.591 --> 30:03.301
I want us to
be together.

30:05.428 --> 30:09.557
I promise I won't hide
anything from you anymore.

30:09.599 --> 30:12.936
Siobhan, you're not the only
one who's hiding things.

30:15.355 --> 30:16.731
[whispers]
Bridget.

30:24.322 --> 30:26.407
Hey.
How's he feeling?

30:26.449 --> 30:27.951
Uh, fine.

30:27.992 --> 30:29.536
He, uh, he got
a phone call.

30:29.577 --> 30:30.745
And I've got a lot
of writing to do,

30:30.787 --> 30:31.955
so I'm gonna get going.

30:31.996 --> 30:33.206
OK.

30:33.248 --> 30:34.999
Thanks for coming by.

30:35.041 --> 30:36.584
Of course.

30:36.626 --> 30:38.586
I'll see you later, Siobhan.

30:44.551 --> 30:46.052
Hey, what are you
doing up like that?

30:46.094 --> 30:47.595
You're gonna rip
your stitches.

30:47.637 --> 30:50.181
Catherine just called.
Juliet's missing.

30:59.023 --> 31:01.317
All Juliet wanted
was to swing by school

31:01.359 --> 31:03.611
to say good-bye to her
friends before the airport.

31:03.653 --> 31:05.196
I didn't see the harm.

31:05.238 --> 31:06.739
You know, and then she
went into the bathroom,

31:06.781 --> 31:08.283
and the next thing
I know, she was gone.

31:08.324 --> 31:09.784
OFFICER: We questioned
everyone in the area.

31:09.826 --> 31:11.327
No one seems
to have seen her.

31:11.369 --> 31:13.746
Why the hell did you let
her out of your sight?

31:13.788 --> 31:15.623
I was outside
for three seconds!

31:15.665 --> 31:17.625
I didn't think she needed
me to help her wipe!

31:17.667 --> 31:20.128
She'd have been
safer here with us.

31:20.169 --> 31:22.171
CATHERINE: You know,
I'm not going to stand here
and argue with you.

31:22.213 --> 31:24.299
I'm going back to the school
to look for her again.

31:24.340 --> 31:27.302
God. What is the address?

31:27.343 --> 31:29.762
ANDREW: 1281 Second Avenue.

31:32.056 --> 31:34.809
1281...?

31:36.352 --> 31:38.146
ANDREW: What is it?

31:38.187 --> 31:41.107
Do you think that this
"3" could be an "8"?

31:41.149 --> 31:45.987
"Zachary Secor,
1281 Second Avenue."

31:46.029 --> 31:47.196
What is that?

31:47.238 --> 31:48.948
This was found

31:48.990 --> 31:51.326
at my business partner,
Olivia Charles', apartment.

31:51.367 --> 31:53.661
Zachary Secor High's
street address.

31:53.703 --> 31:55.788
ANDREW: Olivia doesn't
have any children.

31:55.830 --> 31:58.291
I think she's the one
who took Juliet.

32:07.050 --> 32:09.761
I still need to say
something to you.

32:11.679 --> 32:14.682
I didn't tell you the whole
truth about Tyler Barrett.

32:17.518 --> 32:19.312
I, uh, really
appreciate this.

32:19.354 --> 32:21.064
I'm sure the key is
right on the dresser

32:21.105 --> 32:22.273
where I left it.

32:22.315 --> 32:23.691
That's OK, sir.

32:23.733 --> 32:25.068
Happens all the time.

32:25.109 --> 32:27.070
Well, um,
thank you so much.

32:27.111 --> 32:28.696
Have a good day.

32:51.594 --> 32:53.638
What are you
doing here?

32:54.973 --> 32:58.601
What, your sister
send you?

32:58.643 --> 33:00.311
Sister?

33:00.353 --> 33:03.272
You are Siobhan's
brother, right?

33:04.941 --> 33:07.026
Is that what she
told you?

33:08.987 --> 33:10.363
[scoffs]

33:10.405 --> 33:12.740
I'm not her brother.

33:12.782 --> 33:15.827
Man, can't you see
you're being used?

33:17.370 --> 33:19.539
Yeah...

33:19.580 --> 33:22.917
well, don't be so sure
you're not being used.

33:22.959 --> 33:25.169
We've been sleeping
together for months.

33:29.757 --> 33:32.427
Look... I just want

33:32.468 --> 33:34.429
the flash drive.

33:34.470 --> 33:36.597
Now you want
the flash drive?

33:49.986 --> 33:52.321
Oh, no. Oh, no.

34:17.013 --> 34:19.557
HENRY:
It was an accident.

34:19.599 --> 34:21.184
Henry, you should
have told me.

34:21.225 --> 34:22.810
You were lying,
Siobhan.

34:22.852 --> 34:24.395
I mean, you didn't
even tell me that you

34:24.437 --> 34:26.564
were screwing Tyler,
so how could I trust you?

34:26.606 --> 34:28.357
[sighs]

34:28.399 --> 34:29.942
You're right.

34:29.984 --> 34:31.819
It's my fault. I...

34:31.861 --> 34:33.362
If I hadn't gotten you
mixed up in this,

34:33.404 --> 34:35.656
it wouldn't
have happened.

34:37.033 --> 34:38.659
It's a little late
for that now.

34:38.701 --> 34:41.913
I'm so sorry.

34:41.954 --> 34:43.498
But it's going
to be over soon.

34:43.539 --> 34:44.999
I promise.

34:45.041 --> 34:46.834
We have
the flash drive.

34:49.587 --> 34:52.006
What?

34:52.048 --> 34:56.219
I-I gave it
to Tim Arbogast.

34:56.260 --> 34:57.845
Why would you do that?

34:57.887 --> 34:59.847
As proof that he should pull
his investment.

34:59.889 --> 35:02.016
Because I felt responsible

35:02.058 --> 35:04.477
for getting him to
invest with Martin/Charles.

35:04.519 --> 35:08.314
And since I was no longer
protecting us,

35:08.356 --> 35:11.651
I felt the least I could do
was protect my family.

35:15.988 --> 35:17.156
-OK.
-Mm-hmm.

35:17.198 --> 35:18.658
Thanks.

35:20.701 --> 35:22.578
It's all my fault.

35:22.620 --> 35:25.331
If I hadn't allowed
Olivia to talk me

35:25.373 --> 35:27.250
into covering our losses
with new investors,

35:27.291 --> 35:28.751
Juliet would be down
the hall right now.

35:28.793 --> 35:30.378
Stop.

35:30.419 --> 35:32.213
OK, all that matters is
finding Juliet right now.

35:32.255 --> 35:33.756
And we will.

35:35.842 --> 35:38.678
I just don't get what
Olivia wants with her.

35:38.719 --> 35:40.471
Did Juliet even know
anything

35:40.513 --> 35:42.056
that was going on
at the fund?

35:42.098 --> 35:44.058
I can't see how.

35:44.100 --> 35:47.687
All I can imagine is Olivia
intends to blackmail me

35:47.728 --> 35:50.690
into taking the blame
for it somehow.

35:50.731 --> 35:52.233
Wouldn't she
send you a message

35:52.275 --> 35:54.861
or let you know
what she wants?

35:54.902 --> 35:56.904
I would think so.

35:56.946 --> 35:59.907
But where would she
be hiding Juliet?

35:59.949 --> 36:02.243
I hope she's not
tied up,

36:02.285 --> 36:04.370
freezing somewhere.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.917
What's with
all the wool?

36:09.959 --> 36:12.378
You know it's like 80
degrees in Miami, right?

36:12.420 --> 36:16.299
I don't think
Olivia's behind this.

36:23.139 --> 36:25.099
Yeah. OK.

36:25.141 --> 36:26.309
Right.

36:26.350 --> 36:28.769
Thank you very much.

36:28.811 --> 36:30.897
So your helpful saleslady
at the dry cleaners.

36:30.938 --> 36:32.315
Her name's May Patel,

36:32.356 --> 36:34.066
and her green card
expired seven months ago.

36:34.108 --> 36:35.651
Yeah, I've got a feeling

36:35.693 --> 36:37.111
they're not just
protecting illegals there.

36:37.153 --> 36:38.613
What's the dirt
on Osterman?

36:38.654 --> 36:39.906
Uh, extortion, racketeering,

36:39.947 --> 36:41.324
suspected of armed robbery.

36:41.365 --> 36:42.867
Saw 16 different
indictments.

36:42.909 --> 36:44.118
Nothing's stuck.

36:44.160 --> 36:45.912
Last time he was
convicted was for

36:45.953 --> 36:47.663
a petty theft charge
almost 20 years ago.

36:49.123 --> 36:50.750
Sounds like someone I know
back in Wyoming.

36:50.791 --> 36:52.043
Yeah.

36:52.084 --> 36:53.544
[phone ringing]

36:53.586 --> 36:55.213
Yeah.

36:59.133 --> 37:00.885
[garbled radio transmission]

37:00.927 --> 37:02.345
Mason.

37:02.386 --> 37:04.138
-Machado?
-What do you got?

37:05.598 --> 37:07.141
[Machado sighing]

37:13.940 --> 37:15.566
Body's over there?

37:15.608 --> 37:17.401
It's a few days old

37:17.443 --> 37:19.153
and with the warm weather
we've been having,

37:19.195 --> 37:20.780
pretty gamy.

37:20.821 --> 37:22.782
They're still digging it
out of a shallow grave.

38:00.611 --> 38:01.821
Hey.

38:01.862 --> 38:03.948
Hi.

38:03.990 --> 38:06.659
It's freezing in here.

38:06.701 --> 38:08.411
Well, I don't know how
to work the thermostat,

38:08.452 --> 38:10.746
and I couldn't get
a fire started.

38:10.788 --> 38:13.416
How did you even
find me here?

38:13.457 --> 38:16.419
I might have bought the
scarf as fashion in Miami,

38:16.460 --> 38:18.087
but, um,

38:18.129 --> 38:21.048
the gloves and the hat--
it's a little much.

38:23.259 --> 38:25.970
Plus, I remembered what you
said to me the other day.

38:26.012 --> 38:27.430
Maybe we can talk
about planning

38:27.471 --> 38:30.182
a trip to
the beach house.

38:30.224 --> 38:32.226
You know,
you scared us to death.

38:32.268 --> 38:34.145
We thought that Olivia
took you.

38:34.186 --> 38:35.855
Olivia? No.

38:35.896 --> 38:37.940
I just didn't want
to be with my mom.

38:39.734 --> 38:42.111
Can't she go back to Miami
by herself, please?

38:42.153 --> 38:45.156
Juliet, what's going on
with you guys?

38:46.699 --> 38:48.868
I know there's
something, and...

38:48.909 --> 38:52.079
you have to know that you
can tell me anything.

38:54.832 --> 38:56.792
I've spent a lot of my life

38:56.834 --> 38:59.879
hiding things from
the people that I love,

38:59.920 --> 39:05.009
and the only thing it did
was... hurt people.

39:05.051 --> 39:08.387
I just won't let
that happen anymore,

39:08.429 --> 39:10.973
especially to you.

39:17.104 --> 39:18.481
OK.

39:20.691 --> 39:23.736
Remember when Dad
took away my trust fund?

39:26.072 --> 39:28.449
My mom came up
with a plan

39:28.491 --> 39:31.118
that she said
would change our lives.

39:31.160 --> 39:33.329
The first step
was finding

39:33.371 --> 39:35.498
two willing
participants.

39:37.541 --> 39:39.168
Which I did.

39:41.712 --> 39:43.923
Tessa Banner

39:43.964 --> 39:46.175
and Mr. Carpenter.

39:48.928 --> 39:52.932
Please don't
tell him, Siobhan.

39:52.973 --> 39:54.934
He'll hate me forever.

39:59.188 --> 40:01.148
JULIET: Oh, my God.

40:01.190 --> 40:03.734
ANDREW:
I was so worried about you.

40:03.776 --> 40:05.903
Agent Machado.

40:05.945 --> 40:07.279
Uh, Juliet,

40:07.321 --> 40:09.156
why don't you go
to your room.

40:14.036 --> 40:16.330
What are you doing here?

40:16.372 --> 40:18.749
He has information
about the shooting.

40:18.791 --> 40:21.961
A body's been found.

40:22.002 --> 40:24.171
[garbled radio transmission]

40:36.350 --> 40:37.977
Daniel Eknath was

40:38.018 --> 40:39.562
one of Bodaway Macawi's
lieutenants.

40:39.603 --> 40:41.147
And, uh,
Malcolm Ward's wallet

40:41.188 --> 40:42.982
was found not
far from his body.

40:46.610 --> 40:50.573
You think that this
Eknath killed Malcolm?

40:50.614 --> 40:52.366
Well, we're not
sure yet,

40:52.408 --> 40:54.326
but, uh, from
the looks of it...

40:54.368 --> 40:56.579
ANDREW: I... I still
don't understand

40:56.620 --> 40:57.913
what this has to do
with the shooting.

40:57.955 --> 40:59.165
MACHADO:
I believe Daniel Eknath

40:59.206 --> 41:00.875
shot you, Mr. Martin.

41:00.916 --> 41:02.793
But why would
Eknath want to shoot me?

41:02.835 --> 41:04.211
Or Siobhan, for that matter?

41:04.253 --> 41:05.504
I believe
he didn't know

41:05.546 --> 41:07.089
that Bridget Kelly
had a twin sister.

41:09.842 --> 41:12.094
So, when Eknath aimed his
gun at you, Mrs. Martin,

41:12.136 --> 41:14.430
he thought he was
looking at Bridget.

41:16.140 --> 41:18.309
But he's dead now, right?

41:18.350 --> 41:20.019
Yes, except Macawi's
probably replaced him

41:20.060 --> 41:21.729
with five others.

41:21.770 --> 41:24.064
And if Bodaway Macawi

41:24.106 --> 41:25.858
believes
you're Bridget...

41:25.900 --> 41:28.402
you can bet he'll come
after you again.
