00:00.054 --> 00:04.947
I hear that you are something of
a jazz aficionado, Mr Chambers.

00:05.049 --> 00:07.952
Er... I wouldn't say 'aficionado'.

00:08.240 --> 00:12.484
I also hear
that you are modest to a fault.

00:12.616 --> 00:14.616
The gossips have been out in force.

00:17.116 --> 00:20.158
Everyone has been very positive.

00:20.411 --> 00:21.458
Well...

00:22.699 --> 00:24.173
mostly positive.

00:25.424 --> 00:26.965
'Mostly positive'.

00:27.112 --> 00:28.229
I'll take that.

00:28.569 --> 00:32.214
As you are aware,
my predecessor was erm...

00:32.293 --> 00:34.809
dispatched after some...

00:35.747 --> 00:39.020
'Embarrassment', I think,
was the official line.

00:39.486 --> 00:40.808
Embarrassment.

00:41.755 --> 00:44.240
Doesn't quite cover it, does it?

00:44.587 --> 00:45.958
Not quite.

00:46.360 --> 00:47.509
Still...

00:48.095 --> 00:50.255
it appears that I am to be
the new broom.

00:51.028 --> 00:53.480
I look forward to working with you,
Archdeacon.

00:53.590 --> 00:54.777
Very much so.

00:56.026 --> 00:59.612
I believe we have
a wonderful opportunity here,

00:59.830 --> 01:03.549
to rebuild trust in the clergy,
in the church.

01:04.870 --> 01:07.235
But the last thing we can be
is complacent.

01:08.480 --> 01:12.348
We must put duty above our own needs.

01:12.902 --> 01:15.395
We must lead by example.

01:17.876 --> 01:19.976
I hope I can count on you, Mr Chambers,

01:20.440 --> 01:22.012
to lead by example?

01:22.777 --> 01:24.018
Absolutely.

01:25.690 --> 01:27.000
You can count on me.

I never thought it would come to this.

02:32.841 --> 02:35.054
Don't say it. Don't you dare say it.

02:35.080 --> 02:37.080
It's worse than the jazz.

02:37.120 --> 02:38.534
You were tapping along!

02:38.560 --> 02:41.590
Insulting a man in his place
of worship! How could you?

02:41.616 --> 02:44.656
- He was tapping along!
- To keep his circulation going.

02:44.682 --> 02:47.360
- Oh, poor old stick.
- My ears are ringing.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.400
- Are your ears ringing?
- Shut up.

02:49.440 --> 02:51.440
- Come here.
- Good night.

02:52.284 --> 02:53.747
So much fun!

03:47.450 --> 03:48.877
Stay...

03:53.849 --> 03:55.795
You're a good man, Chambers.

03:57.304 --> 04:00.136
- It's bloody annoying, isn't it?
- Really, really annoying.

04:39.800 --> 04:40.985
Leonard?

04:45.308 --> 04:46.749
Hey. Hey.

05:18.433 --> 05:20.555
- Hello?
- <i>Stop fondling your girlfriend.</i>

05:20.790 --> 05:22.308
<i>We've got business to attend to.</i>

05:52.251 --> 05:54.771
It's soup. It's tomato soup.

05:54.920 --> 05:56.105
Do you know him?

05:57.529 --> 05:58.545
No.

05:58.678 --> 06:02.017
- Terence Atwell, 75.
- Dr Atwell runs the soup kitchen.

06:02.043 --> 06:05.317
- Runs a kitchen for the homeless. Mr Hardwick...
- Harland.

06:05.343 --> 06:08.263
- ..came into clean at 4:00...
- Closer to 4:15, actually.

06:08.289 --> 06:10.999
- ..and he found him. Thank you, Mr Hardwick.
- Harland.

06:13.675 --> 06:15.699
There's no sign of blows to the head.

06:15.786 --> 06:18.306
Natural causes? Heart attack, maybe?

06:24.774 --> 06:26.138
That's no heart attack.

06:28.999 --> 06:31.080
How does a man drown
in the middle of a church?

06:40.430 --> 06:41.684
Where's the Doc?

06:42.224 --> 06:43.599
Carked it, mate.

06:45.905 --> 06:48.720
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

06:48.956 --> 06:50.333
Have you been here all night?

06:50.766 --> 06:52.207
Did you see what happened?

06:53.161 --> 06:56.592
♪ My Bonnie lies over the ocean ♪

06:56.915 --> 07:00.120
♪ My Bonnie lies over the sea ♪

07:00.268 --> 07:02.160
I want a post-mortem ASAP.

07:02.470 --> 07:04.200
And get a statement from Hardwick.

07:04.606 --> 07:06.640
- Harland.
- OK.

07:10.480 --> 07:11.986
What do you know about birds?

07:13.037 --> 07:14.048
What?

07:14.913 --> 07:16.529
Well, it's dead.

07:16.555 --> 07:19.360
- Thank you, Detective
- Not on the breakfast table.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.016
Could be a pulmonary embolism.

07:21.042 --> 07:22.790
I read about them in
the Manchester Guardian.

07:23.001 --> 07:24.479
Kills you just like that.

07:24.505 --> 07:27.105
Or perhaps he was feeling a bit low
and just couldn't go on.

07:27.648 --> 07:29.800
- Flew in the window.
- Which wasn't open.

07:29.840 --> 07:32.726
- The dog brought it in, then.
- And shut the door behind him?

07:34.880 --> 07:37.280
It flew in the bloody window.

07:40.976 --> 07:42.257
Vicarage?

07:45.916 --> 07:47.056
Hello?

08:07.661 --> 08:08.743
No!

08:09.698 --> 08:12.280
No. He didn't give a damn
when Grace was born.

08:12.306 --> 08:14.306
He's not been to visit her once.

08:16.062 --> 08:18.235
I am counselling my parishioner!

08:18.261 --> 08:20.287
And you need the door closed
for that, do you?

08:25.071 --> 08:27.000
This is Guy doing what he always does.

08:27.040 --> 08:30.056
- He... he's trying to control you.
- He's not seeing her.

08:30.457 --> 08:32.837
He wants to take her away.
I won't let that happen.

08:35.201 --> 08:37.472
He has no power any more, Sidney.

08:39.380 --> 08:41.152
She's still out there, isn't she?

08:45.548 --> 08:47.840
Come in! Pull up a chair

08:58.600 --> 09:02.040
You know why this is happening,
don't you? Dead birds and that.

09:02.629 --> 09:04.416
You think you're being ever so careful.

09:04.835 --> 09:07.290
With the fibbing and the sneaking about.

09:09.285 --> 09:12.520
But if I know what's going on
with you and Mrs Hopkins,

09:12.560 --> 09:15.160
- then others know.
- There's nothing going on.

09:18.729 --> 09:20.679
Don't think I've ever seen you happier.

09:23.262 --> 09:24.660
With the little miss here...

09:26.083 --> 09:27.575
I suppose we all are.

09:29.945 --> 09:31.749
But how long do you think it can last?

09:32.521 --> 09:34.526
With your job, and her down the road?

09:34.817 --> 09:37.798
You can't be a vicar and be with her.

09:38.259 --> 09:40.439
You can't marry a divorced woman.

09:40.610 --> 09:41.970
That's the truth of it.

09:43.973 --> 09:46.473
Sooner or later, you'll
have to make a choice.

09:50.823 --> 09:52.643
40 years a doctor.

09:53.175 --> 09:55.798
In his spare time,
Atwell feeds the homeless.

09:58.214 --> 09:59.840
It's his kid, Sidney.

09:59.880 --> 10:01.536
The bastard's doing it to get at us.

10:01.562 --> 10:03.562
- You know what you need?
- Here we go.

10:03.588 --> 10:06.226
You need to get your end away.
All this pent-up frustration.

10:06.252 --> 10:08.147
- I'm not frustrated!
- No?

10:09.998 --> 10:11.100
I'm not.

10:11.279 --> 10:12.863
It's not like anyone would know.

10:14.094 --> 10:15.386
I would know.

10:16.378 --> 10:17.574
God would know.

10:18.925 --> 10:21.720
Mm. You think God gives a rat's arse
what you get up to in the bedroom?

10:24.863 --> 10:27.800
40 years a doctor.
Church six times a week.

10:27.941 --> 10:31.000
- More than me.
- Who'd want to kill a saint?

10:44.889 --> 10:46.288
Police.

11:00.208 --> 11:02.840
I know her. I'm sure I do.

11:09.138 --> 11:11.988
_

11:16.034 --> 11:18.034
Sidney? Upstairs.

11:22.320 --> 11:23.948
He was putting his affairs in order.

11:25.248 --> 11:26.941
He knew he was going to die.

11:28.269 --> 11:31.320
How did Dr Atwell
know he was going to die?

11:49.930 --> 11:53.100
Maybe it's an announcement
of impending evil.

11:53.574 --> 11:54.837
You what?

11:54.924 --> 11:58.160
Sergeant's position is coming up.
I've been doing some reading.

11:59.125 --> 12:00.803
Steady on, Phil.

12:01.623 --> 12:05.386
Everything I could find on
Dr Atwell and Ivy Franklin.

12:06.474 --> 12:09.776
- Ivy Franklin?
- Matron at Dapple Oak.

12:09.911 --> 12:11.679
It's a home for the feeble-minded.

12:11.741 --> 12:15.015
Atwell was medical superintendent
there until he retired.

12:15.109 --> 12:17.998
- Get Miss Franklin in, will you?
- Even I'm not that good.

12:18.130 --> 12:19.647
She died three months ago.

12:19.673 --> 12:22.193
Natural causes, before you go
getting all excited.

12:25.948 --> 12:28.026
I hear she's got herself a fella.

12:28.130 --> 12:29.351
Shut up.

12:29.563 --> 12:31.563
Sift through this lot.

12:35.097 --> 12:36.513
_

12:38.921 --> 12:41.161
Geordie, tell me you've found something.

12:41.187 --> 12:43.897
<i>Birds die so beautifully, don't they?</i>

12:45.721 --> 12:47.258
Why are you doing this?

12:47.579 --> 12:48.884
<i>You know why.</i>

12:48.910 --> 12:50.270
<i>They knew why.</i>

12:51.229 --> 12:55.490
<i>I even left her a memento as I
helped her gasp her last breath.</i>

12:56.555 --> 12:59.554
<i>Your night is coming, Mr Chambers.</i>

12:59.945 --> 13:02.051
Operator at the exchange
should be able to tell us

13:02.077 --> 13:03.406
where he's phoning from.

13:04.450 --> 13:07.447
- We'll find him, Sidney.
- I've stopped.

13:09.354 --> 13:11.487
- She's made you stop.
- She hasn't made me stop.

13:11.513 --> 13:13.673
No sex, making you give up vices.
You're as good...

13:13.699 --> 13:15.734
As good as married.
You've done that one already.

13:16.570 --> 13:18.459
What if that's what this is about?

13:18.563 --> 13:20.708
What if it's about me and Amanda?

13:21.169 --> 13:23.450
- That's your conscience talking.
- Well, what, then?

13:23.490 --> 13:26.490
I... I don't know him.
I have no connection to him.

13:29.620 --> 13:30.881
You know her, though.

13:31.784 --> 13:33.254
You took her funeral.

13:41.584 --> 13:45.490
Ivy dedicated her life
to the welfare of others.

13:45.592 --> 13:47.530
To the residents of Dapple Oak,

13:47.570 --> 13:49.932
she was Nanny Ivy.

13:51.570 --> 13:53.570
Boiled sweets in her pockets.

13:54.245 --> 13:58.690
Always ready with a kind word
or a cuddle.

13:59.216 --> 14:01.810
She was an angel on this earth.

14:02.530 --> 14:04.589
Now God is calling her home.

14:04.833 --> 14:08.301
Maybe that's the connection.
Doctor, nurse, vicar.

14:08.410 --> 14:11.890
- Pillars of the community.
- Ivy died at the home, in her sleep.

14:12.242 --> 14:13.998
That's what everyone assumed.

14:16.806 --> 14:19.748
Aunt Ivy's heart gave out,
Dr Atwell said.

14:21.698 --> 14:23.330
And you had no reason to doubt him?

14:23.370 --> 14:25.967
She was old. She was frail.

14:26.702 --> 14:28.475
Your aunt and the doctor...

14:28.501 --> 14:30.602
- They were close?
- No.

14:32.605 --> 14:35.384
But... we know they worked
at the home together.

14:35.410 --> 14:36.827
Well, then, you have your answer.

14:37.549 --> 14:40.210
I'd offer you tea,
but you won't be long, I'd imagine.

14:40.250 --> 14:43.017
- Can we see your aunt's room?
- That won't be possible.

14:43.962 --> 14:45.361
Let me rephrase that.

14:46.123 --> 14:47.924
Show us her room, Miss Franklin.

15:00.157 --> 15:01.690
Dad, we've got visitors.

15:04.212 --> 15:07.252
It's his lungs. Dad's
always suffered with them.

15:14.530 --> 15:16.208
When your aunt died...

15:16.895 --> 15:18.379
nothing struck you as odd?

15:19.268 --> 15:20.530
Up you come.

15:20.570 --> 15:23.890
There was nothing left in here?
Nothing out of place?

15:24.496 --> 15:25.898
Like what?

15:27.319 --> 15:28.826
Like a bird.

15:33.650 --> 15:35.470
I left the window open.

15:36.345 --> 15:38.179
The poor thing got trapped.

15:38.744 --> 15:40.510
How could you possibly know that?

15:46.863 --> 15:49.970
Are you going to have a lovely bath
with your duckie?

15:49.996 --> 15:53.937
Oh, yes, you are, my beautiful girl.

15:54.523 --> 15:55.650
Yes, you are.

16:22.890 --> 16:25.559
Shouldn't leave them alone.

16:29.303 --> 16:30.834
It can't be her.

16:31.050 --> 16:32.412
The voice on the phone.

16:33.709 --> 16:35.570
She sure as hell knows something,
though.

16:35.610 --> 16:37.273
Did you see when you mentioned the home?

16:37.587 --> 16:39.348
Oh, she bloody knows something.

16:43.731 --> 16:46.071
I only left her for a second!

16:49.632 --> 16:52.370
- Give her to me.
- She's all right. All right.

16:52.410 --> 16:53.831
- Aren't you?
- Come on, now.

16:53.857 --> 16:55.540
I'm not gonna hurt her.

16:56.099 --> 16:57.419
Give her to me.

16:59.563 --> 17:00.930
I didn't mean any harm.

17:03.255 --> 17:05.538
Sidney. Sidney...

17:05.571 --> 17:09.338
Sidney. Sidney. Sidney!
That's enough, now.

17:15.089 --> 17:16.570
I saw it.

17:17.220 --> 17:19.051
I saw him die.

17:22.492 --> 17:25.492
Doc was finishing up for the night.

17:26.972 --> 17:28.444
And I saw them...

17:29.249 --> 17:31.695
There was someone in the shadows.

17:36.635 --> 17:39.045
And they grabbed him...

17:39.815 --> 17:42.072
..and they held him under the water.

17:43.325 --> 17:45.325
And I didn't stop them.

17:47.014 --> 17:50.770
- Who's 'they'?
- Bring back my Bonnie.

17:50.810 --> 17:53.450
- Who's 'they', Jerry?
- Bring back my Bonnie!

17:54.359 --> 17:55.862
Is that what he said?

17:56.769 --> 17:58.297
Is that what the killer said?

17:58.323 --> 18:00.864
Bring her back. Bring her back!

18:00.890 --> 18:03.450
My Bonnie! My Bonnie!

18:03.490 --> 18:05.490
My Bonnie, my Bonnie, my Bonnie...

18:06.530 --> 18:09.170
He was right. There's
water in Atwell's lungs

18:09.210 --> 18:10.732
and bruising to the neck.

18:11.452 --> 18:13.410
Jerry might be a few threads
short of a jumper,

18:13.450 --> 18:15.150
but it corroborates what he saw.

18:15.176 --> 18:17.041
I was ready to kill him.

18:20.050 --> 18:21.591
Yeah, I knew it would happen.

18:22.482 --> 18:24.599
You find out what it means
to be a father.

18:30.609 --> 18:33.526
The killer's getting revenge
for his Bonnie.

18:34.160 --> 18:36.286
So he drowns Terence Atwell...

18:36.879 --> 18:38.524
and he kills Ivy Franklin.

18:38.550 --> 18:40.250
She died in her sleep.

18:40.344 --> 18:43.390
- We don't know that for sure.
- And we're never likely to, are we?

18:48.142 --> 18:50.246
_

18:50.704 --> 18:52.250
What if I say no?

18:53.246 --> 18:55.071
Well, then, we'd have to wonder why.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.683
Mr Finch will be with you
the entire time.

18:59.770 --> 19:03.130
It will be done in the most
respectful of ways.

19:03.170 --> 19:06.006
Digging her up, cutting
her open? Respectful?

19:07.491 --> 19:11.542
If... her death was unnatural,

19:12.597 --> 19:14.245
wouldn't you rather know?

19:15.261 --> 19:18.322
If it were me... if it were my aunt,

19:19.533 --> 19:20.853
I'd want to know.

19:26.286 --> 19:28.347
'I am the resurrection and the life, '

19:28.373 --> 19:30.010
sayeth the Lord.

19:30.050 --> 19:33.130
'He that believeth in me,
though he were dead,

19:33.970 --> 19:35.316
yet shall he live.

19:36.130 --> 19:38.810
And whosoever liveth
and believeth in me...

19:39.964 --> 19:41.334
..shall never die.'

19:43.864 --> 19:45.824
I know that my redeemer liveth,

19:46.232 --> 19:49.131
and that he shall stand up
at the last upon the earth,

19:49.812 --> 19:51.792
whom I shall see for myself.

19:52.151 --> 19:54.404
And mine eyes shall behold.

19:55.506 --> 19:57.745
We brought nothing into this world,

19:58.178 --> 20:00.967
and it is certain
we can carry nothing out.

20:01.873 --> 20:05.370
The Lord gave, and the
Lord hath taken away,

20:05.410 --> 20:08.210
and underneath are the everlasting arms.

20:08.250 --> 20:11.970
Neither death nor life nor angels...

20:12.010 --> 20:15.650
But according to thy mercy,
think thou upon me, O Lord.

20:15.981 --> 20:19.504
For thy height nor depth
nor any other...

20:19.530 --> 20:22.770
shall be able to separate us
from the love of God,

20:22.810 --> 20:25.770
which is in Christ, Jesus, our Lord.

20:26.241 --> 20:29.241
Whether we live, we live unto the Lord.

20:29.570 --> 20:33.170
And whether we die,
we die unto the Lord.

20:46.056 --> 20:47.267
Please.

20:49.470 --> 20:52.230
I hear we owe you a great debt,
Mr Finch.

20:52.316 --> 20:53.903
I don't know about that.

20:54.270 --> 20:58.150
My predecessor was something
of a scoundrel, by all accounts.

20:58.627 --> 21:02.621
But you stood up to him like Jesus
to the money-lenders.

21:02.855 --> 21:04.943
I was a little less erudite than Jesus.

21:04.969 --> 21:07.933
I think the same
could be said of all of us.

21:09.638 --> 21:12.841
You have been doing a sterling job...

21:13.386 --> 21:14.990
in most areas.

21:16.056 --> 21:18.310
Oh, dear. Is it the Russian literature?

21:18.544 --> 21:20.310
I have a habit of referring to books

21:20.350 --> 21:23.550
which no person in their right mind
would be interested in.

21:27.121 --> 21:28.387
It is a...

21:29.082 --> 21:31.710
privileged position
we find ourselves in.

21:32.332 --> 21:35.476
Working with the vulnerable, the needy.

21:35.502 --> 21:36.748
Undoubtedly.

21:37.669 --> 21:39.470
I understand that you were acquaintances

21:39.510 --> 21:41.254
with a known homosexual.

21:44.232 --> 21:47.189
Befriending those whom society rejects

21:47.590 --> 21:50.003
is at the heart of Christ's mission.

21:51.521 --> 21:52.526
But...

21:53.764 --> 21:57.192
if that friendship becomes...
too close...

22:04.001 --> 22:07.888
One day, we hope to see you
in a parish of your own.

22:08.510 --> 22:10.648
With a family of your own.

22:10.984 --> 22:12.257
Perhaps.

22:14.085 --> 22:15.180
Y-yes.

22:15.851 --> 22:17.738
I see that, too.

22:31.869 --> 22:33.750
Two former employees.

22:33.790 --> 22:36.407
Dr Atwell and Ivy Franklin, both killed.

22:36.697 --> 22:38.550
Odds on, it's to do with this place.

22:50.304 --> 22:52.470
Has Mother sent for me?

22:52.510 --> 22:55.347
Dot. Dot. Remember what we said.

22:55.550 --> 22:57.550
Please, sir, help me!

23:19.154 --> 23:20.679
Give us a ciggie.

23:21.030 --> 23:24.123
- Er... Oh. He's given up.
- Why have you given up?

23:24.677 --> 23:26.992
- It's for a woman.
- It's not for a woman.

23:30.483 --> 23:31.947
Andrew?

23:33.311 --> 23:34.750
What did we say?

23:34.790 --> 23:37.550
- Fingers on lips.
- Fingers on lips.

23:40.510 --> 23:41.776
Veronica Stone.

23:42.904 --> 23:44.162
Please.

23:45.800 --> 23:47.910
No gifts, I'm afraid.

23:48.845 --> 23:50.070
It's hardly a gift.

23:50.110 --> 23:52.270
Keep your voices down,
if you don't mind.

24:09.405 --> 24:13.181
Dr Atwell was a stand-up,
all-round good chap.

24:13.897 --> 24:15.833
And Ivy, bless her.

24:16.482 --> 24:18.576
She gave herself to this place.

24:19.272 --> 24:20.654
TB wing.

24:22.057 --> 24:23.789
I wouldn't, if I were you.

24:27.284 --> 24:28.550
Shame, isn't it?

24:28.590 --> 24:29.962
Old age.

24:30.630 --> 24:32.424
Happens to the best of us.

24:33.263 --> 24:36.346
Now, what would you say
if we told you it wasn't old age?

24:37.001 --> 24:38.745
I'd say you were having me on.

24:41.513 --> 24:44.826
Don't you recognise it?
We found this in Ivy's grave.

24:45.260 --> 24:47.153
We don't have toys here.

24:48.154 --> 24:49.715
Who's Bonnie?

24:51.209 --> 24:52.669
I don't know a Bonnie.

24:54.230 --> 24:56.230
You've never had a resident
by that name?

24:56.270 --> 24:59.510
I don't know any Bonnie.

25:00.538 --> 25:02.815
Then you won't mind if we have
a look through your records.

25:04.199 --> 25:05.565
Look all you like.

25:08.217 --> 25:10.026
It's no skin off my nose.

25:33.954 --> 25:36.631
No-one's kitchen makes sense
to anyone but themselves,

25:36.873 --> 25:38.110
don't you find?

25:38.522 --> 25:40.065
Are you spying on me?

25:40.091 --> 25:41.666
No. No.

25:44.770 --> 25:46.409
Why did you burn the letter?

25:47.567 --> 25:49.663
And I thought you were here
because you wanted to be.

25:52.907 --> 25:54.987
So, where did this letter come from?

25:58.426 --> 26:00.158
He was at Aunt Ivy's funeral.

26:02.005 --> 26:03.677
People were ever so generous.

26:03.983 --> 26:06.150
We made nearly £30 for the home.

26:07.129 --> 26:08.592
But then I saw the letter.

26:09.680 --> 26:11.307
It was addressed to you.

26:11.931 --> 26:14.931
I don't know why, but I took it
from the collection plate.

26:15.824 --> 26:17.066
I think you do.

26:17.868 --> 26:19.491
I think you know why.

26:31.317 --> 26:34.791
Aunt Ivy held it against the stove
when I broke a dinner plate.

26:36.253 --> 26:37.768
I was 12 at the time.

26:40.374 --> 26:44.270
You kept the letter because you
feared what it said about her?

26:44.310 --> 26:47.710
I showed Dr Atwell. He told
me to keep it to myself.

26:48.239 --> 26:50.925
Ivy was dead.
What good was it going to do?

26:51.032 --> 26:52.308
What did it say?

26:56.731 --> 26:58.394
That she was going to hell.

27:00.140 --> 27:02.421
That you needed to look at the home.

27:03.479 --> 27:04.987
That something had to be done.

27:07.896 --> 27:09.730
And there was no name? No signature?

27:13.310 --> 27:15.830
Well, that's why he's targeting you.

27:16.385 --> 27:17.987
Because nothing was done.

27:23.150 --> 27:25.562
There was bugger all
in the file she gave me.

27:25.588 --> 27:27.588
Well, bugger all of use, anyway.

27:28.156 --> 27:31.270
Does this place look like it's had
£30 spent on it recently?

27:33.764 --> 27:36.321
Hm. She's not doing too badly
for herself.

27:39.195 --> 27:41.000
She's not gonna tell us anything.

27:42.810 --> 27:45.246
- We're not gonna ask, are we?
- No.

27:57.667 --> 27:59.020
Five minutes.

28:12.031 --> 28:13.131
_

28:23.965 --> 28:25.318
_

28:48.183 --> 28:50.183
Has Mother sent for me?

28:51.065 --> 28:52.844
- Where's Mother?
- Shh!

28:52.870 --> 28:55.424
I want Mother!

28:58.227 --> 28:59.765
Help!

29:08.270 --> 29:10.310
It's all right. You're all right.

29:10.412 --> 29:12.412
We're going to be trouble now.

29:21.857 --> 29:25.121
Bonnie liked birds
cos they could fly away.

29:29.413 --> 29:30.806
You knew her.

29:32.790 --> 29:35.190
Andrew, did you know her?

29:35.230 --> 29:36.856
Fingers on lips.

29:37.556 --> 29:39.349
Fingers on lips.

29:39.783 --> 29:41.950
I'm here day in, day out.

29:41.990 --> 29:43.832
Feeding them, clothing them.

29:44.215 --> 29:45.888
Cleaning up their filth.

29:45.913 --> 29:48.153
These codes. What do they mean?

29:49.070 --> 29:51.510
It's Dr Atwell's system.
It's before my time.

29:54.286 --> 29:57.230
No-one else cleans up their filth.
No-one else gives a damn!

29:57.270 --> 29:59.550
I try! I do!

29:59.590 --> 30:01.017
Not hard enough.

30:10.921 --> 30:12.382
Spoke to her boss.

30:12.462 --> 30:14.401
Oh, Miss Stone's doing a stand-up job

30:14.427 --> 30:16.099
under difficult circumstances,
apparently.

30:16.262 --> 30:18.255
Difficult circumstances?

30:18.560 --> 30:20.359
<i>For the residents, maybe.</i>

30:22.774 --> 30:24.534
The killer has been in that home.

30:24.590 --> 30:26.866
He's seen what's happening.

30:26.892 --> 30:29.372
- Are you having a ciggie?
- No...

30:31.945 --> 30:36.074
- No fondling the girlfriend.
- All above the jumper, don't worry.

30:40.257 --> 30:41.421
Any luck?

30:41.921 --> 30:43.270
Oh er...

30:43.310 --> 30:45.237
I close my eyes and
all I see is numbers.

30:45.292 --> 30:46.722
I'll have a look if you like.

30:47.409 --> 30:49.072
I was always good at maths.

30:49.098 --> 30:51.524
'If Alan eats three oranges
and five apples,

30:51.550 --> 30:52.896
what does he have?' and all that.

30:53.056 --> 30:55.056
Indigestion, by the sound of it.

30:57.627 --> 30:58.764
Cathy?

31:00.346 --> 31:02.172
Margaret, this is my wife, Cathy.

31:02.547 --> 31:04.295
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

31:06.587 --> 31:07.950
I'm working!

31:07.990 --> 31:10.430
I don't know why I bother.

31:10.470 --> 31:12.470
Oh, Cathy, come on.

31:14.052 --> 31:15.419
Cathy.

31:16.630 --> 31:18.390
Esme's teacher phoned.

31:18.430 --> 31:20.230
She didn't go to school today.

32:01.270 --> 32:02.751
She's fine.

32:02.777 --> 32:04.230
She's making scones.

32:04.578 --> 32:07.328
She's fine. She's making scones.

32:07.470 --> 32:09.470
You tell her she's in for a hiding!

32:09.510 --> 32:11.817
- Tell her she's in for a hiding.
- I'm not gonna do that.

32:12.162 --> 32:13.309
Goodbye.

32:16.500 --> 32:19.582
- Is Dad cross?
- He'll calm down.

32:20.570 --> 32:22.860
He's cross all the time nowadays.

32:23.797 --> 32:25.655
He doesn't like Mum any more.

32:26.058 --> 32:27.915
They fight all the time.

32:30.571 --> 32:32.687
Grown-ups do, sometimes.

32:33.110 --> 32:35.257
It doesn't mean
they don't love each other.

32:39.679 --> 32:41.516
Hey... Esme.

32:44.614 --> 32:46.070
Don't cry.

32:46.562 --> 32:49.122
I want them to be happy again.

32:53.310 --> 32:55.390
Maybe if you talked to your dad?

32:58.853 --> 33:00.470
Do you want me to talk to him?

33:03.513 --> 33:06.254
It would break his heart to
know how unhappy you are.

33:06.569 --> 33:09.249
He'd move heaven and earth
to make it better.

33:11.790 --> 33:13.486
That's his job, isn't it?

33:13.830 --> 33:15.910
To make sure you're happy,

33:15.950 --> 33:17.560
at any cost?

33:24.350 --> 33:26.150
You're doing the face.

33:26.994 --> 33:29.514
Dad calls it your faraway face.

33:33.565 --> 33:36.350
The first two numbers
never go higher than 31.

33:36.596 --> 33:38.366
It's a date. The day.

33:38.430 --> 33:40.631
The next two numbers are the month,

33:40.657 --> 33:44.697
- so 2-3-0-3 is...
- March 23rd.

33:45.585 --> 33:47.405
Patient's date of birth.

33:48.256 --> 33:49.672
What about these other four numbers?

33:49.698 --> 33:51.398
Initials, I think.

33:51.424 --> 33:53.942
A is 01, B is 02.

33:53.968 --> 33:56.470
So anyone called Bonnie,

33:56.901 --> 33:59.830
the fifth and sixth numbers would be 02.

34:00.346 --> 34:01.642
B for Bonnie.

34:02.257 --> 34:04.310
You're wasted in that typing pool.

34:04.740 --> 34:06.489
Don't I know it?

34:11.572 --> 34:13.572
B08.

34:18.248 --> 34:20.504
Bonnie H.

34:29.417 --> 34:30.745
Vicarage?

34:30.771 --> 34:33.364
<i>If there's a god, why is there evil?</i>

34:34.235 --> 34:37.184
<i>And if God made us in his image,
why are we sinners?</i>

34:38.056 --> 34:39.739
Bonnie was your daughter.

34:41.157 --> 34:42.829
<i>Maybe God was right.</i>

34:43.150 --> 34:46.469
<i>Maybe the only way to make the
fathers understand their sins</i>

34:46.801 --> 34:48.510
<i>is to punish their young.</i>

34:49.244 --> 34:51.161
<i>What would Grace make of that?</i>

35:13.182 --> 35:14.732
Amanda!

35:21.615 --> 35:23.399
Grace.

35:29.503 --> 35:30.964
Amanda!

35:34.720 --> 35:36.206
No!

35:44.020 --> 35:46.660
Get off him! Off him!

35:51.589 --> 35:53.345
Get off!

35:57.550 --> 35:59.350
Sidney. Sidney...

36:43.290 --> 36:45.108
- It's Harland!
- I know.

36:58.484 --> 36:59.796
No!

37:18.342 --> 37:19.910
She's not breathing.

37:19.950 --> 37:22.149
It's what they did to Bonnie.

37:23.853 --> 37:25.966
It's how they punished her.

37:26.150 --> 37:27.640
Apologise.

37:35.011 --> 37:36.877
It's how they killed her.

37:37.344 --> 37:39.630
- You all knew!
- I didn't know.

37:39.670 --> 37:41.670
Her heart gave out, they said.

37:41.710 --> 37:43.690
But Andrew saw!

37:43.984 --> 37:45.734
I didn't know.

37:46.015 --> 37:48.084
An angel, you called that bitch!

37:48.110 --> 37:51.030
Hey. I never saw the letter.

37:53.917 --> 37:57.514
What angel buries a child and won't
tell her father where she is?

37:59.919 --> 38:01.231
Come on!

38:08.169 --> 38:12.175
Dr Atwell was as responsible as Ivy
Franklin for my daughter's death.

38:12.329 --> 38:13.946
You had a choice.

38:14.322 --> 38:16.322
You didn't have to put her in there.

38:17.870 --> 38:21.590
A widower, bringing up
a feeble-minded girl alone?

38:22.734 --> 38:24.579
They didn't give me a choice.

38:27.160 --> 38:29.920
Where did they take Bonnie
after she died, Andrew?

38:32.270 --> 38:33.611
You can talk.

38:33.872 --> 38:35.470
There's no-one to stop you.

38:52.859 --> 38:54.866
They buried Bonnie here.

39:04.321 --> 39:06.321
They put them all here.

39:34.587 --> 39:36.505
I don't know what to do with myself.

39:37.604 --> 39:40.310
I've spent so long taking
care of everyone else.

39:42.279 --> 39:44.799
You know, I've never even been to
the Orchard tea-rooms.

39:45.015 --> 39:46.408
I'll take you.

39:47.150 --> 39:49.950
Oh, you... you don't have to do that.

39:50.699 --> 39:53.459
We could take a boat down the river.

39:56.721 --> 39:59.776
Sometimes I wonder
if I'm afraid to be happy.

40:00.709 --> 40:02.569
Not sure I deserve it.

40:09.296 --> 40:12.252
Contentment is a gift, hard-won.

40:16.016 --> 40:17.936
I'd say you deserve it.

40:28.392 --> 40:30.512
I'll leave these on your desk, shall I?

40:31.146 --> 40:32.653
Thank you.

40:34.784 --> 40:36.446
She looks nice, your wife.

40:37.917 --> 40:39.716
Don't know what I was expecting.

40:41.779 --> 40:43.204
Good night, then.

40:44.139 --> 40:45.696
Good night.

40:53.489 --> 40:55.519
I thought we weren't doing this
any more.

41:28.457 --> 41:30.232
Without family,

41:30.271 --> 41:31.830
we are lost.

41:32.443 --> 41:34.408
With the birth of a child,

41:35.252 --> 41:37.470
our lives change instantly.

41:38.842 --> 41:41.755
We love more. We fear more.

41:42.388 --> 41:44.366
We hope more.

41:47.017 --> 41:49.017
With the death of a child...

41:50.119 --> 41:53.088
..our lives change beyond all measure.

41:55.295 --> 41:57.630
All we can do is love our children

41:57.670 --> 41:59.238
in the time we have them.

42:01.710 --> 42:03.942
Love them without end.

42:17.635 --> 42:19.064
No toys.

42:35.129 --> 42:36.861
- Amanda...
- I know.

42:37.390 --> 42:39.790
We can't stop him from seeing her.

42:39.993 --> 42:41.993
I know.

42:44.750 --> 42:46.228
If I was Guy...

42:47.201 --> 42:48.692
If it were me...

42:48.718 --> 42:50.718
You're a good man, Chambers.

42:52.590 --> 42:53.786
Damn you.

43:17.701 --> 43:18.897
How are you?

43:18.923 --> 43:20.292
Fine, thank you.

43:20.430 --> 43:22.430
Living in Grantchester, I understand.

43:22.870 --> 43:24.316
For the time being, yes.

43:25.128 --> 43:28.590
I'm sure Sidney's going to great
lengths to make you feel welcome.

43:28.817 --> 43:30.577
What is it you want, Guy?

43:33.859 --> 43:35.200
Is she well?

43:37.230 --> 43:39.470
She had a bit of a cold,
but she's fine now.

43:41.247 --> 43:42.775
May I hold her?

44:04.150 --> 44:07.157
I don't have a solicitor.
I can't afford one at the moment.

44:07.957 --> 44:11.080
But when I can, I intend to make
an application for a divorce.

44:11.119 --> 44:12.525
I'm keeping her, Guy.

44:13.499 --> 44:15.070
I don't want her brought up by nannies

44:15.110 --> 44:17.390
or sent off to some joyless
boarding school.

44:17.617 --> 44:19.040
She's staying with me.

44:20.636 --> 44:22.197
She's beautiful.

44:26.041 --> 44:29.070
I've made sure a terrible mess
of things, haven't I?
