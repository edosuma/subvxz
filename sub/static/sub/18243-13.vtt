"Just Add Magic"...

00:07.007 --> 00:09.052
Hannah: That's Rose,
the girl we saw before.

00:09.139 --> 00:10.401
Kelly:
If Rose had the book,

00:10.488 --> 00:12.186
then she must have been
a protector.

00:12.273 --> 00:13.491
Like us.

00:13.578 --> 00:14.797
Help me.

00:14.884 --> 00:16.538
How can we help you, Rose?

00:16.625 --> 00:18.279
Maybe she wants to
get out of the book.

00:18.366 --> 00:19.889
But this is just a drawing.

00:19.976 --> 00:21.108
Kelly: Unless it isn't,
and it actually is--

00:21.195 --> 00:23.936
Rose.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.156
Scott: I'm meeting a guy
who says he thinks he knows
what happened to Grandma.

00:26.243 --> 00:30.117
He told me
he thought Grandma was
under a magic spell.

00:30.204 --> 00:31.466
Look at this.

00:31.553 --> 00:33.076
- Is that--
- Chuck.

00:33.163 --> 00:35.426
- Hannah: Look at the date.
- Kelly: 1868.

00:35.513 --> 00:37.211
Chuck is not
from the '60s.

00:37.298 --> 00:39.039
Not the 1960s.

00:39.126 --> 00:41.780
You've been hurt.
But you can be fixed.

00:41.867 --> 00:43.391
[glass breaking]

00:43.478 --> 00:46.046
Gina: Chuck was clearly
looking for something.

00:46.133 --> 00:47.960
He took very
specific spices.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.701
Kelly: I found this
in Chuck's trailer.

00:49.788 --> 00:51.790
Hannah: It looks like
a shopping list of spices.

00:51.877 --> 00:52.965
Kelly: It looks like he's
trying to create

00:53.053 --> 00:54.663
a recipe or something.

00:54.750 --> 00:56.012
I can't believe
that's Chuck.

00:56.099 --> 00:57.405
He must have
taken over Jake

00:57.492 --> 00:59.015
to get out of
Lavender Heights.

00:59.102 --> 01:01.104
He gave us so much
free food.

01:01.191 --> 01:03.367
What if he's been
spelling us?

01:03.454 --> 01:05.456
[coughing]

01:05.543 --> 01:07.110
Oh, no. Chuck.

01:07.197 --> 01:08.155
Good luck
saving your friend.

01:08.242 --> 01:09.634
We just saved Jake.

01:09.721 --> 01:10.853
Not that friend.

01:18.034 --> 01:20.080
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

01:20.167 --> 01:22.169
I'm fine.
Just a little dizzy.

01:22.256 --> 01:24.040
Maybe it was from
all the smoke.

01:24.127 --> 01:26.564
Nice try.
Chuck gave me something.

01:26.651 --> 01:29.045
But what's his plan,
and why me?

01:29.132 --> 01:31.482
Why me?
He took over my body,

01:31.569 --> 01:33.528
and I've been nothing
but nice to the guy.

01:33.615 --> 01:34.964
We've all been
nice to him.

01:35.051 --> 01:36.574
Hold on.
We still don't know that

01:36.661 --> 01:38.010
Chuck spelled Hannah
for sure.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.578
How do you explain my
sudden dizziness, then?

01:40.665 --> 01:42.189
And I'm cold.

01:42.276 --> 01:44.626
You always think you're
coming down with something.

01:44.713 --> 01:46.671
Last week,
you were convinced
you had scurvy

01:46.758 --> 01:48.020
from your lack of
vitamin C.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.327
According to Google,
I had all the symptoms.

01:50.414 --> 01:53.548
The book must have
a recipe to help us.

01:53.635 --> 01:54.679
You want to do
the honors?

01:59.641 --> 02:01.469
Look. Rose.

02:01.556 --> 02:04.254
Looks like a
Victorian era portrait.

02:04.341 --> 02:05.603
It's not a portrait,
this is her.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.519
She's trying to
tell us something.

02:11.609 --> 02:12.697
Darbie: Whoa.

02:13.872 --> 02:15.004
Beyond creepy.

02:15.091 --> 02:17.137
What is it?
Did you find something?

02:17.224 --> 02:18.529
Everything's fine,
Hannah.

02:18.616 --> 02:19.965
What?

02:20.052 --> 02:21.271
I'm having trouble
hearing you.

02:23.534 --> 02:24.753
[gasping]

02:26.537 --> 02:28.365
- You don't suppose--
- It couldn't be.

02:28.452 --> 02:29.671
It is.

02:29.758 --> 02:32.108
Hannah's going
into the book.

02:37.809 --> 02:40.725

02:46.035 --> 02:48.298

what spell she's under.

02:50.735 --> 02:51.954
Or why.

02:52.041 --> 02:54.304
He put Rose in the book,
and now Hannah.

02:54.391 --> 02:56.088
We're way past the why.

02:56.176 --> 02:59.004
Bet he tried to do it
to one of us back in '65.

02:59.091 --> 03:02.182
What reason would he have for
trapping someone in the book?

03:02.269 --> 03:04.314
There's one person
who knows the answers.

03:04.401 --> 03:06.186
- Rose.
- Great.

03:06.273 --> 03:08.927
Our fate lies in the hands of
a 200 year old girl

03:09.014 --> 03:10.755
stuck in the pages
of a magic book.

03:10.842 --> 03:12.409
We need to talk to her.

03:12.496 --> 03:14.281
Maybe if she can tell us
how she got into the book,

03:14.368 --> 03:16.587
we can figure out
a counter spell to
help save Hannah.

03:16.674 --> 03:18.807
I wish I knew
what Chuck is up to.

03:18.894 --> 03:22.158
There must be
some larger reason why
he's doing all this.

03:22.245 --> 03:24.160
We don't even know
who Chuck is.

03:24.247 --> 03:25.857
Maybe it's time
we find out.

03:25.944 --> 03:27.598
Guys.

03:27.685 --> 03:29.948
Hannah needs to lie down.
She doesn't look too good.

03:30.035 --> 03:32.037
And her hearing
keeps going in and out.

03:32.124 --> 03:34.779
Nobody's home at my house.
We can take her there.

03:34.866 --> 03:37.521
Okay, we'll go dig up
what we can on Chuck Peizer.

03:37.608 --> 03:39.915
Maybe we can figure out
why he's doing this.

03:40.002 --> 03:41.569
I'll stay here
with Jake.

03:41.656 --> 03:43.527
He's also been through a lot
the last couple days.

03:43.614 --> 03:45.399
Should we tell Hannah?

03:45.486 --> 03:47.966
Considering
how crazy she gets
when she has a cough,

03:48.053 --> 03:51.492
I don't think she'll handle
becoming a drawing in a book
very well.

03:51.579 --> 03:54.059
Uh, at least she
doesn't have to go
to her new school.

03:56.888 --> 03:59.151
Sorry. I crack jokes
when I'm nervous.

04:03.373 --> 04:04.722
Terri:
I had no idea you were

04:04.809 --> 04:07.290
so passionate about
historic preservation.

04:07.377 --> 04:09.205
Well, you've been
talking about it non-stop.

04:09.292 --> 04:11.381
I guess you
inspired me.

04:11.468 --> 04:13.340
I had no idea you two
were even friends.

04:13.427 --> 04:16.560
- I wouldn't go that fa--
- I've known Gina all my life.

04:16.647 --> 04:19.649
We're old enough to need
historic preservation
ourselves.

04:19.737 --> 04:21.826
[chuckles]
I'm just glad you
want to help out.

04:21.913 --> 04:23.263
You know,
I tried to get Kelly
to volunteer,

04:23.350 --> 04:24.873
but she's not
interested.

04:26.744 --> 04:29.225
You know,
Saffron Falls has
such a rich history,

04:29.312 --> 04:30.835
and we need to
honor that.

04:30.922 --> 04:32.359
You know,
I'm thinking of
raising money

04:32.446 --> 04:33.577
to open a
heritage museum.

04:33.664 --> 04:34.752
It would cover
the original settlers

04:34.839 --> 04:36.798
who came here for
the gold rush--

04:36.885 --> 04:39.801
Sounds interesting.
What do you know about
the Peizer family?

04:39.888 --> 04:42.282
Oh, uh, well,
yes, um,

04:42.369 --> 04:44.240
the Peizers were among
the original settlers

04:44.327 --> 04:45.763
of Saffron Falls.

04:45.850 --> 04:48.375
They were a wealthy family
from New York, I believe.

04:48.462 --> 04:51.378
And when they died,
they left their house and
the land to the city.

04:51.465 --> 04:53.118
The lived in
West Peizer Park?

04:53.205 --> 04:55.817
Oh, the park used to be
part of the Peizer estate.

04:55.904 --> 04:58.385
Did you know that
they had all sorts of
unique plants and trees

04:58.472 --> 05:00.038
that are still there?

05:00.125 --> 05:01.518
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

05:01.605 --> 05:03.303
Luckily,
the family will
stipulated that

05:03.390 --> 05:04.956
the land couldn't be
developed on.

05:05.043 --> 05:07.655
Otherwise,
it would have been
a strip mall by now.

05:07.742 --> 05:10.179
Wait right here.

05:10.266 --> 05:13.487
Now we know why
Chuck's trailer was
in West Peizer Park.

05:13.574 --> 05:15.837
He was going home.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.362
Why don't you
start with these.

05:19.449 --> 05:22.191
Um, what do you
want us to do?

05:22.278 --> 05:23.714
Just organize
according to subject,

05:23.801 --> 05:27.283
and then further organize
according to year.

05:27.370 --> 05:29.329
This could take a while.

05:29.416 --> 05:31.069
We have
all the free coffee
you can drink.

05:31.156 --> 05:33.115
And there's
a vending machine
around the corner.

05:33.202 --> 05:34.159
Thanks again.

05:36.510 --> 05:39.339
[sighs]
I don't even know
where to start.

05:39.426 --> 05:41.166
How about with
the free coffee?

05:41.253 --> 05:42.385
Milk,
no sugar for me.

05:46.084 --> 05:48.652
I got it.
Just rest.

05:48.739 --> 05:50.698
I feel fine,
Mama P.

05:50.785 --> 05:53.048
I can't believe I lost
four days of my life.

05:53.135 --> 05:54.702
So you don't
remember anything?

05:54.789 --> 05:57.922
No. One minute I was
in Lavender Heights
on a delivery,

05:58.009 --> 05:59.533
I turned around
and saw Chuck,

05:59.620 --> 06:01.535
and he was
giving me one of his
creepy little smiles.

06:01.622 --> 06:03.145
He is a creepy kid.

06:03.232 --> 06:04.973
Next thing I know,
I'm in the back room,

06:05.060 --> 06:06.670
and smoke is everywhere.

06:06.757 --> 06:08.846
You don't remember
any of our conversations?

06:08.933 --> 06:12.154
No. Why? Should I?

06:12.241 --> 06:14.417
No, not really.

06:14.504 --> 06:16.288
I hope I didn't miss much
while I was away.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.335
Oh, it was just
the same old same old.

06:19.422 --> 06:22.251
Except for
a very nice lunch
at Le Grande Falls.

06:22.338 --> 06:23.818
Wait, what?
Le Grand Falls?

06:23.905 --> 06:25.167
I've been dying
to go there.

06:25.254 --> 06:27.735
I know,
that's why I took you.

06:27.822 --> 06:29.040
Well, Chuck.

06:29.127 --> 06:30.694
But technically,
it was your body,

06:30.781 --> 06:33.741
so I guess you ate
the lobster, not him.

06:33.828 --> 06:35.177
I had the lobster?

06:35.264 --> 06:37.353
And soufflé for dessert.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.790
Wow. Thanks.

06:39.877 --> 06:41.488
I guess.

06:41.575 --> 06:42.706
What was the occasion?

06:42.793 --> 06:44.273
There wasn't one.

06:44.360 --> 06:47.798
I just wanted to do
something nice.

06:47.885 --> 06:49.757

once in a while,
you know.

06:49.844 --> 06:51.585

06:51.672 --> 06:53.804
Go home.

06:53.891 --> 06:55.502
Okay, I guess I am

you need to lie down.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.446
No. I need to know
what spell I'm under.

07:28.099 --> 07:29.405
You're keeping
something from me.

07:32.060 --> 07:34.758
Chuck is putting you
in the book.

07:34.845 --> 07:35.890
What did you say?

07:35.977 --> 07:37.021
Chuck is putting you
into the book.

07:37.108 --> 07:38.675
No, I heard you,

We have to do something.

contact Rose

07:47.510 --> 07:49.556
so we can figure out
how she got into the book.

07:49.643 --> 07:52.820
But so far,
nothing's been coming up.

07:52.907 --> 07:55.170
Well, remember when we
couldn't talk to Grandma,

07:55.257 --> 07:57.694
so we used the
Mind Pairing Peppermints?

07:57.781 --> 07:59.653
We can't do
that one again.

07:59.740 --> 08:03.091
One of us knocked over the
livionian peppermint oil.

08:03.178 --> 08:06.137
But that was to read
someone's mind now.

09:25.782 --> 09:26.783
I know you will.

09:42.451 --> 09:43.713
Okay, Rose,

09:43.800 --> 09:45.541
time to show us how you
got into the book.

09:53.505 --> 09:54.855
I don't know about this,
Charles.

09:54.942 --> 09:56.596
You mustn't worry
so much, Rose.

09:56.683 --> 09:59.163
I know what I'm doing.

09:59.250 --> 10:02.210
Maybe the magic
isn't ours to keep.

10:02.297 --> 10:03.603
The book chose us
for a reason.

10:03.690 --> 10:05.605
It's our destiny.

10:05.692 --> 10:08.695
We must insure it
remains in our possession
for all time.

10:09.652 --> 10:11.567
I'm scared.

10:11.654 --> 10:12.916
There's no need.

10:14.614 --> 10:15.919
Here.

10:17.225 --> 10:18.226
Trust me.

10:20.881 --> 10:23.753
♪♪

10:37.114 --> 10:38.463
Whoa.

10:38.550 --> 10:40.901
Chuck wanted to
keep the book forever.

10:40.988 --> 10:42.642
So he cooked an
immortality spell.

10:42.729 --> 10:44.121
And he gave Rose
the first bite

10:44.208 --> 10:46.254
so that she'd take
the downside.

10:46.341 --> 10:48.082
Chuck must have
sacrificed her

10:48.169 --> 10:49.866
in order to become
immortal.

10:49.953 --> 10:52.086
So why is he
trapping Hannah
in the book?

10:52.173 --> 10:53.914
I'm not sure.
Maybe he needed to

10:54.001 --> 10:55.263
sacrifice somebody else

10:55.350 --> 10:57.482
in order to keep the
immortality spell going.

10:57.569 --> 10:59.528
We need to find a way
to stop this, Kelly.

11:00.660 --> 11:01.835
We will.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.229
I've lived here
my whole life,

11:05.316 --> 11:09.146
and never appreciated the
history of Saffron Falls.

11:09.233 --> 11:10.931
It's all
very educational,

11:11.018 --> 11:12.149
but I don't see
anything here

11:12.236 --> 11:13.934
that's gonna
help us with Chuck.

11:17.720 --> 11:20.157
Gina, there's something
I need to say.

11:20.244 --> 11:21.506
What'd I do now?

11:23.595 --> 11:27.295
I'm sorry I used my morbium
to break up our trio.

11:28.644 --> 11:29.993
It was selfish.

11:31.778 --> 11:34.563
I've spend 50 years
trying to rationalize it,

11:34.650 --> 11:37.653
but it was just wrong.

11:39.350 --> 11:41.831
Yes, it was.

11:41.918 --> 11:44.834
But I don't blame you.

11:44.921 --> 11:46.401
The older I get,
the more I realize

11:46.488 --> 11:48.098
life isn't
black and white.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.928
I just...

11:52.015 --> 11:55.149
wish I'd thought of
another way.

11:55.236 --> 11:57.151
I don't believe in
holding onto the past.

12:00.110 --> 12:01.416
That having been said,

12:01.503 --> 12:03.244
we'd better get
back to the past.

12:06.856 --> 12:08.902
Oh, I think
I have something.

12:08.989 --> 12:11.165
It's from 1868.

12:12.253 --> 12:14.211
"Peizer Girl
Goes Missing."

12:14.298 --> 12:16.518
Gina: "Rose Peizer,

12:16.605 --> 12:19.216
"the daughter of
real estate tycoon
Joseph Peizer,

12:19.303 --> 12:23.090
"disappeared from
the family estate
yesterday afternoon."

12:23.177 --> 12:26.484
Rose Peizer.

12:26.571 --> 12:31.098
"None of the house staff
recall anything untoward
or suspicious."

12:31.185 --> 12:34.057
"According to
her brother Charles,

12:34.144 --> 12:36.756
"Rose was happily
playing outside,

12:36.843 --> 12:39.323
"and when he went to
retrieve her,

12:39.410 --> 12:41.151
"she was gone."

12:43.371 --> 12:46.069
Well, now we know
who Rose is.

12:46.156 --> 12:47.984
Chuck's sister.

12:55.426 --> 12:56.993
[whispering] The drawing
seems to have stopped.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.778
There's no need
to whisper.

12:58.865 --> 13:00.562
Her hearing is shot.

13:00.649 --> 13:02.912
Right.
Why did it stop?

13:02.999 --> 13:04.696
Don't know.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.960
But I'm just glad
it did.

13:07.047 --> 13:08.483
At least she's
sleeping.

13:15.620 --> 13:18.362
I need the mulberry.

13:18.449 --> 13:20.669
- Stop.
- [gasps]

13:20.756 --> 13:21.975
I need the mulberry.

13:22.062 --> 13:23.803
You mustn't.

13:23.890 --> 13:25.456
Charles has put you
under a spell

13:25.543 --> 13:28.459
from which
you cannot escape
if you eat that.

13:28.546 --> 13:30.331
But... I have to.

13:30.418 --> 13:33.116
You cannot.
Resist at all cost.

13:37.164 --> 13:38.078
Listen to me.

13:39.557 --> 13:41.821
I do not have much time.

13:41.908 --> 13:42.865
I'm weak.

13:42.952 --> 13:45.476
Why?
What happened?

13:45.563 --> 13:47.000
When Charles returned,

13:47.087 --> 13:50.003
I cast a spell that
erased his memory.

13:50.090 --> 13:52.092
By taking his mind,

13:52.179 --> 13:54.355
I sacrificed my body.

13:54.442 --> 13:56.705
That's why we've only
seen you in dreams.

13:56.792 --> 13:58.489
Yes.

13:58.576 --> 14:00.927
And my time
is running out.

14:01.014 --> 14:02.493
But you must know,

14:02.580 --> 14:05.105
many, many years ago,

14:05.192 --> 14:08.108
Charles was a protector
just like you.

14:08.195 --> 14:09.979
There were two of them.

14:10.066 --> 14:12.460
But there's always
three protectors.

14:12.547 --> 14:16.725
After Charles,
the protectors became a trio

14:16.812 --> 14:19.380
so this terrible tragedy
would never happen again.

14:20.642 --> 14:23.514
I've done all I can.

14:23.601 --> 14:26.169
It's up to you now.

14:26.256 --> 14:29.738
You must not
let him succeed.

14:31.087 --> 14:32.959
[heavy breathing]

14:39.835 --> 14:41.619
Mulberry tree.

14:41.706 --> 14:43.665
Hannah, lie down.

14:43.752 --> 14:45.449
- Mulberry tree.
- Hannah, Hannah,
it's just--

14:45.536 --> 14:47.147
- Hannah, it's just a dream.
- No, I need the mulberry tree.

14:47.234 --> 14:48.409
Hannah,
it's just a dream.

14:48.496 --> 14:50.150
- It's okay.
- Okay, okay.

14:50.237 --> 14:52.021
It's okay, it's okay,
it's all right.

14:56.069 --> 14:57.897
That was not good.

14:57.984 --> 15:01.465
What was she saying,
mulberry tree?

15:01.552 --> 15:03.119
That sounds familiar.

15:03.206 --> 15:04.164
Come on.

15:08.733 --> 15:09.691
Here it is.

15:11.562 --> 15:13.608
The list of ingredients
we found in Chuck's trailer.

15:13.695 --> 15:16.393
Lapsis watercress,
tengu cocoa nibs,

15:16.480 --> 15:19.353
livonian licorice
werepoes mulberries.

15:19.440 --> 15:20.876
These must be
the list of ingredients

15:20.963 --> 15:22.704
that Chuck used
to spell Hannah.

15:22.791 --> 15:25.446
But why is Hannah
dreaming about mulberries?

15:25.533 --> 15:27.230
Maybe the magic
makes her crave it.

15:28.928 --> 15:32.844
Darbie, what if
the spell's not complete?

15:32.932 --> 15:35.369
Yeah.
That's why the drawing
stopped in the book.

15:35.456 --> 15:38.198
The spell won't finish
until Chuck gives her
the werepoes mulberry.

15:38.285 --> 15:39.851
Right, werepoes affects
physical things,

15:39.939 --> 15:41.244
her drawing's
in the book,

15:41.331 --> 15:42.506
but she can't
physically go into it

15:42.593 --> 15:44.117
until she eats
the mulberry.

15:44.204 --> 15:46.249
So as long as we
keep Hannah from it,
she's okay.

15:49.992 --> 15:50.950
She's gone.

15:53.082 --> 15:54.649
Where'd she go?

15:54.736 --> 15:55.650
She could be anywhere.

15:57.304 --> 15:59.306
She took the cookbook.

15:59.393 --> 16:00.568
We have to talk to
the OCs.

16:11.057 --> 16:13.537
Hi, Hannah.

16:13.624 --> 16:14.582
Right on schedule.

16:16.888 --> 16:18.847
Let's get started.

16:21.284 --> 16:24.026
Rose is Chuck's sister?

16:24.113 --> 16:25.245
And he put her
in the book.

16:25.332 --> 16:27.073
Nice family.

16:27.160 --> 16:29.771
Did Hannah say
anything else when
she was dreaming?

16:29.858 --> 16:32.948
No, she just kept repeating
mulberry tree.

16:33.035 --> 16:34.210
Maybe she
went to find one.

16:34.297 --> 16:36.560
Have you ever heard of
werepoes mulberry?

16:36.647 --> 16:39.955
Yes, they must be prepared
and eaten immediately
after they're picked,

16:40.042 --> 16:41.522
otherwise,
they lose their power.

16:41.609 --> 16:43.872
That's why Chuck hasn't
already given her one.

16:43.959 --> 16:46.266
Where do we find
this mulberry tree?

16:46.353 --> 16:47.963
I'm not sure,
I've never seen one.

16:48.050 --> 16:50.226
I bet I know.

16:50.313 --> 16:51.923
West Peizer Park.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.187
That's where you said
he grew up, right?

16:54.274 --> 16:56.624
Terri said the family
wouldn't let the land
be developed.

16:56.711 --> 16:59.409
And there are still
a lot of unique plants there

16:59.496 --> 17:01.237
from when the Peizer's
owned the land.

17:01.324 --> 17:04.327
Of course they're unique,
they're magical.

17:04.414 --> 17:06.589
That's where Chuck's
been getting his spices.

17:06.676 --> 17:09.506
I bet that's why
he picked that spot
for his trailer.

17:09.593 --> 17:10.637
We better
get to the park.

17:21.170 --> 17:22.563
Almost there,
Hannah.

17:22.650 --> 17:23.912
Hang tight.

17:23.999 --> 17:26.435
You're never gonna
get away with this.

17:26.522 --> 17:28.612
Hey.
You're free to go.

17:30.484 --> 17:32.355
Thought so.

17:32.442 --> 17:34.531
Kelly: Chuck!

17:34.618 --> 17:36.185
It's too late.
Go away.

17:36.272 --> 17:38.579
- Let Hannah go.
- I can't do that.

17:38.666 --> 17:40.320
Come on,
we can take him,
he's scrawny.

17:42.278 --> 17:44.019
Kelly: Oh, another
barrier spell.

17:44.106 --> 17:46.413
I've been waiting
a long time for this.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.241
I'm not leaving
anything to chance.

17:48.328 --> 17:50.069
Why are you doing this?
Why Hannah?

17:50.156 --> 17:51.679
It wasn't on purpose.

17:51.766 --> 17:53.594
Hannah just ate
the wrong Jakerito.

17:53.681 --> 17:55.770
I actually think
all three of you
are groovy.

17:55.857 --> 17:58.773
I've changed my mind on
bringing that word back.

17:58.860 --> 18:00.122
You need to
put a protector
in the book

18:00.209 --> 18:01.515
so that you can
stay immortal.

18:01.602 --> 18:03.908
Isn't that right,
Charles?

18:03.995 --> 18:05.301
I always knew
you were bad,

18:05.388 --> 18:08.435
but to sacrifice
your own sister?

18:08.522 --> 18:10.263
You know about Rose?

18:10.350 --> 18:12.961
Bet she had no idea
her brother was a monster.

18:13.048 --> 18:15.268
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

18:15.355 --> 18:17.357
- You weren't there.
- You're right, I wasn't.

18:17.444 --> 18:20.055
But you were.
And I'm sure you
remember it well.

18:22.318 --> 18:23.450
Get outta here!

18:23.537 --> 18:24.494
No!

18:28.411 --> 18:29.543
I'm scared.

18:29.630 --> 18:31.588
There's no need.

18:31.675 --> 18:33.460
Here.

18:33.547 --> 18:34.852
Trust me.

18:44.949 --> 18:45.907
Rose?

18:47.082 --> 18:48.039
Where'd you go?

18:51.086 --> 18:53.741
No, no, no, no, no!

18:53.828 --> 18:55.046
This wasn't
supposed to happen.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.874
Rose.
Rose!

18:56.961 --> 18:58.876
Rose!
Rose!

19:00.400 --> 19:02.097
What have I done?

19:02.184 --> 19:03.490
Get out of my mind!

19:06.536 --> 19:09.017
I don't believe it.
It was a mistake.

19:09.104 --> 19:12.151
You didn't mean to
sacrifice Rose, did you?

19:12.238 --> 19:14.240
I didn't know
what would happen.

19:14.327 --> 19:16.459
Then why put Hannah
in the book?

19:16.546 --> 19:17.895
He's not just putting her
in the book,

19:17.982 --> 19:20.333
he's swapping her out
for Rose.

19:20.420 --> 19:22.073
Isn't that right?

19:22.161 --> 19:24.380
I can only
complete the switch
with another protector.

19:24.467 --> 19:27.122
I can't believe
I spent 50 years
feeling guilty

19:27.209 --> 19:29.211
about what we did to you
by accident.

19:29.298 --> 19:30.908
I made a promise to Rose.

19:30.995 --> 19:32.258
We won't let you
destroy our friend

19:32.345 --> 19:33.737
because of your mistake.

19:33.824 --> 19:36.697
There's nothing you can do
to stop me.

19:36.784 --> 19:39.134
No counter spell
you can cook this time.

19:39.221 --> 19:41.789
You're right.
But I don't need to cook.

19:41.876 --> 19:42.833
When I was under
the Fix It spell,

19:42.920 --> 19:44.226
I looked into your eyes,

19:44.313 --> 19:45.575
and saw that there's
good in you.

19:48.143 --> 19:49.449
What are you doing?

19:49.536 --> 19:50.450
No!

19:53.366 --> 19:54.497
[giggling]

19:56.499 --> 19:58.066
That looks great,
Rose.

19:58.153 --> 19:59.894
Well done.

19:59.981 --> 20:01.504
It's too thick.
Let me redo it.

20:01.591 --> 20:03.724
The pie will taste the same
regardless of the thickness.

20:03.811 --> 20:04.855
[giggling]

20:04.942 --> 20:07.031
I've never had
mulberry pie.

20:07.118 --> 20:09.817
Don't worry.
There's never been a pie
you haven't enjoyed.

20:09.904 --> 20:11.688
[giggling]

20:11.775 --> 20:13.037
One final step.

20:13.124 --> 20:15.170
Carving our initials
into the crust.

20:16.389 --> 20:17.390
[giggling]

20:24.135 --> 20:25.180
Stop.

20:25.267 --> 20:26.529
I don't want to
remember this.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.795
You loved your
little sister.

20:33.884 --> 20:35.669
Just like we love Hannah.

20:36.931 --> 20:38.280
She was just
a little girl.

20:40.326 --> 20:41.675
She loved her
big brother.

20:44.068 --> 20:45.026
Isn't that right?

20:47.985 --> 20:49.857
This is all my fault.

20:49.944 --> 20:52.033
No, it's not your fault.
You didn't know.

20:53.861 --> 20:55.210
She trusted me.

20:58.996 --> 21:02.261
[sobbing]
She trusted me.

21:03.827 --> 21:04.785
[sighs]

21:10.138 --> 21:12.096
I can see.

21:12.183 --> 21:13.228
I can hear.

21:19.016 --> 21:20.409
You did it.

21:20.496 --> 21:21.845
You saved me.

21:26.589 --> 21:28.591
- I told you we would.
- Easy peasy.

21:28.678 --> 21:31.159
Okay, you guys are
the best friends ever.

21:31.246 --> 21:34.075
Seriously, we are.

21:34.162 --> 21:37.208
Kelly,
I think you just broke
Chuck's immortality spell.

21:40.168 --> 21:42.518
I just gave him back
his humanity.

21:42.605 --> 21:44.955
You were right.

21:45.042 --> 21:46.914
There was good in Chuck.

21:47.001 --> 21:50.265
He just buried it
for 150 years.

21:51.484 --> 21:53.660
Hold on.

21:53.747 --> 21:56.053
If Chuck's
immortality spell
is broken,

21:56.140 --> 21:57.316
that means that
it also broke for...

22:00.275 --> 22:01.232
Rose.

22:06.890 --> 22:08.457
Charles?

22:08.544 --> 22:09.719
It can't be.

22:19.686 --> 22:22.253
Where are we?

22:22.341 --> 22:23.298
What are you wearing?

22:26.083 --> 22:27.520
I have a lot to explain.

22:33.221 --> 22:34.178
Thank you.

22:45.538 --> 22:47.757
My vision's back,
right?

22:47.844 --> 22:50.107
Because it looks like
they just disappeared.

22:50.194 --> 22:52.893
But how?
That's impossible.

22:52.980 --> 22:55.461
Nothing's impossible
with magic, girls.

22:56.984 --> 22:58.942
There's still a lot
we all have to learn.

23:01.771 --> 23:03.294
Whoa.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.339
Where'd this
come from?

23:04.426 --> 23:06.907
Rose Peizer Park?

23:06.994 --> 23:10.519
Okay, two minutes ago,
this was West Peizer Park.

23:10.606 --> 23:12.347
"Dedicated to
Rose Peizer,

23:12.434 --> 23:15.698
"born 1857,
died 1939."

23:15.785 --> 23:19.354
When the spell broke,
they went back to the 1800s

23:19.441 --> 23:20.660
to live out
their lives.

23:20.747 --> 23:24.185
She lived to be 82.
Not bad.

23:24.272 --> 23:26.970
So, none of this
happened?

23:27.057 --> 23:29.712
Oh, it happened.

23:29.799 --> 23:31.845
We're the only ones
who know the truth.

23:48.905 --> 23:49.993
Who wants a Jakerito?

23:50.080 --> 23:51.952
- Mm.
- I don't know.

23:52.039 --> 23:53.344
It's me, Darbie.

23:53.432 --> 23:56.478
I know,
it's just gonna
take a while.

23:56.565 --> 23:57.523
Okay, I'm over it.

23:57.610 --> 23:59.089
[laughter]

23:59.176 --> 24:00.439
Good job, girls.

24:00.526 --> 24:01.831
I'm really
proud of you.

24:01.918 --> 24:03.442
I'm proud of all of us.

24:03.529 --> 24:06.923
Chuck has been
a big part of our lives
for too long.

24:07.010 --> 24:09.839
I am looking forward
to moving on.

24:09.926 --> 24:12.059
Now we can finally have
our summer of fun.

24:12.146 --> 24:13.974
For another
couple of weeks.

24:14.061 --> 24:15.279
Doesn't school start
soon?

24:15.366 --> 24:16.846
Hey, two weeks
is two weeks.

24:16.933 --> 24:18.500
We don't have time
to waste.

24:18.587 --> 24:20.067
- Hannah, do you have your--
- Summer of fun list?

24:20.154 --> 24:21.938
I just
emailed it to you.

24:22.025 --> 24:23.853
