WEBVTT

00:09.092 --> 00:11.011
Don't walk away from me
when I'm yelling at you!

00:11.178 --> 00:12.679
I'll walk away from you if I want to.

00:12.888 --> 00:14.806
- It's my house!
- Yes, don't I know it.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.350
You have no respect for my stuff.

00:16.516 --> 00:18.727
<i>Well, if you had labelled
the cassette Rodeo Bloopers,</i>

00:18.894 --> 00:20.103
I wouldn't have taped over it,

00:20.312 --> 00:22.147
I would've thrown it away.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.074

00:38.163 --> 00:39.247
Dad, I'm sorry.

00:39.456 --> 00:40.790
Forget it, Fras.

00:40.999 --> 00:43.335
It's just I've been so tense lately,
being out of work.

00:43.501 --> 00:45.795
I know, it's not easy us both
being home so much.

00:45.962 --> 00:48.798
Yeah. Well, I suppose that during
this little in-between-jobs period,

00:49.007 --> 00:52.135
we should just try to be extra careful
to not get on each other's nerves.

00:52.344 --> 00:53.553
All right, I'll do that.

00:54.220 --> 00:55.639
Good.

00:56.348 --> 00:57.474
Dad, what's this?

00:57.640 --> 01:00.018
Oh, a call came in for you.

01:00.769 --> 01:02.187
Rebecca Wendell.

01:02.353 --> 01:04.438
- Oh, my God.
- Isn't she that model you been after?

01:04.647 --> 01:07.275
Not just a model, Dad.
A lingerie model.

01:07.442 --> 01:10.028
I met her at the symphony.
Wow, this is amazing.

01:10.236 --> 01:12.447
- When did this come in?
- About an hour ago.

01:12.614 --> 01:14.782
- I was here an hour ago.
- Yeah, you were in the tub.

01:14.991 --> 01:17.327
That didn't stop you yesterday
when you came in to ask me

01:17.493 --> 01:20.079
if a peach smelled funny.
For God's sakes, Dad.

01:20.288 --> 01:21.831
I'd like to know why this is my fault.

01:21.998 --> 01:25.001
I put it there in the special-message
bowl that we're all supposed to use.

01:25.168 --> 01:26.628
Damn, it's her machine.

01:26.794 --> 01:28.963
Thanks. I've been looking forward
to this for months.

01:29.172 --> 01:31.132
Now you know how I feel
about the rodeo tape.

01:31.341 --> 01:33.343
For God's sake, the two things
have no comparison!

01:33.509 --> 01:35.136
Hello, Rebecca.

01:35.345 --> 01:37.305
It's Frasier. Sorry I missed you.

01:37.513 --> 01:41.517
Please try again. Bye.

01:41.684 --> 01:44.937
I hope you're happy.
I have to sit here all afternoon

01:45.104 --> 01:46.397
waiting for the phone to ring.

01:46.606 --> 01:49.525
- As opposed to what you normally do?
- Oh, that's rich coming from you.

01:49.692 --> 01:53.446
A man who's spent the last five years
welded to his aptly named La-Z-Boy.

01:53.613 --> 01:56.240
Well, I'm not so lazy
that I can't get the hell out of here.

01:56.449 --> 01:58.826
- I haven't finished talking yet.
- I'm finished listening.

01:59.035 --> 02:01.913
- As usual, running from the problem.
- Not the problem, the yammering.

02:02.079 --> 02:04.373
You wanna tape over something?
Try your mouth!

02:09.544 --> 02:11.422
- Hey, Martin.
- Oh, hi, Roz.

02:11.630 --> 02:13.591
Decaf latte to go, please.
So is Frasier here?

02:13.758 --> 02:15.634
I hope not.

02:15.843 --> 02:18.262
Oh, he's just been such a pill lately.

02:18.429 --> 02:20.765
You know, it's tough for people
when they're out of work.

02:20.973 --> 02:23.350
They just get a little tense
and irritable.

02:23.559 --> 02:26.145
To go, I said to go.

02:27.605 --> 02:29.773
Maybe you need to take a little break
from each other.

02:29.940 --> 02:31.734
Have you ever thought about,
I don't know,

02:31.901 --> 02:33.694
staying with Niles for a while?

02:33.903 --> 02:36.196
Out of the frying pan,
into the fire, huh?

02:36.697 --> 02:40.159
Think about it. Niles' place is so huge,
and he's at work all the time.

02:40.367 --> 02:43.537
Yeah, it's true.
And Maris is out of the picture now.

02:43.996 --> 02:45.873
You know what?
I just thought of something.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.624
For a while there,
your daughters-in-law

02:47.791 --> 02:49.626
were Maris and Lilith.

02:51.462 --> 02:54.048
- Whoa, happy Thanksgiving.
- Yeah.

02:54.465 --> 02:55.507
Hey, Niles.

02:55.674 --> 02:56.925
- Oh, hello.
- Niles.

02:57.092 --> 02:58.969
I'm not interrupting
anything personal, am I?

02:59.136 --> 03:03.140
Yeah, Niles, we just eloped.
I'm your new mom.

03:03.432 --> 03:05.684
Well, I'll be a son of a bitch.

03:08.270 --> 03:10.439
Latte, please.

03:10.647 --> 03:12.524
Martin, why don't you tell Niles
your new idea?

03:12.691 --> 03:14.067
Well, actually, it was Roz's idea,

03:14.234 --> 03:16.403
but I think she might have something,
you know.

03:16.570 --> 03:18.739
Frasier and I have been
kind of butting heads lately.

03:18.947 --> 03:22.075
Well, Frasier has been very difficult.
I don't know how you live with him.

03:22.284 --> 03:23.327
Well, that was Roz's idea.

03:23.493 --> 03:26.204
She suggested that I move in
with you for a while.

03:27.956 --> 03:30.459
- Did she?
- Yeah.

03:30.667 --> 03:33.003
Yeah, you know, we talked about it
when I first got shot

03:33.170 --> 03:34.880
but, of course,
Maris was the problem.

03:35.046 --> 03:39.009
So I guess the big question now is,
do you still want me?

03:39.217 --> 03:40.427
Oh, don't be silly.

03:40.594 --> 03:44.639
I want you just as much now
as I wanted you then.

03:45.140 --> 03:46.683
Well, I guess this is gonna work out.

03:46.850 --> 03:48.602
- Thanks, Roz.
- Don't mention it.

03:48.768 --> 03:51.479
The look on Niles' face
is thanks enough.

03:54.608 --> 03:56.651
Now, Dad, you're sure
it won't bother you

03:56.818 --> 03:59.070
to live so far from the park
and McGinty's...

03:59.279 --> 04:02.657
Oh, no, no, not at all. There's a bus
that stops right in front of your place.

04:02.824 --> 04:05.535
- Eddie and I don't mind taking the bus.
- Eddie?

04:07.162 --> 04:08.997
Eddie.

04:09.164 --> 04:12.500
You know, I just remembered, Dad,
my building doesn't allow dogs.

04:12.709 --> 04:14.878
Well, that's it then,
because I'm not leaving Eddie.

04:15.086 --> 04:17.172
Oh, of all the horrendous luck.

04:17.338 --> 04:19.173
Oh, well, thanks anyway.

04:19.382 --> 04:21.593
I guess I'll just look for a little place.

04:21.759 --> 04:22.844
Can't be too small though,

04:23.011 --> 04:24.804
because I gotta have a bedroom
for Daphne.

04:38.401 --> 04:40.903
You know, Dad,
about that no-dog rule,

04:41.070 --> 04:43.656
I could speak to Clarice,
the head of our co-op board.

04:43.865 --> 04:45.992
Oh, really?
You think they'd make an exception?

04:46.200 --> 04:48.703
Well, let's just say she's bent
quite a few rules in her day

04:48.870 --> 04:51.789
and if she doesn't want her husband
to find out, she'll bend this one.

04:51.998 --> 04:54.125
- That's great.
- Yes, well, then it's settled.

04:54.333 --> 04:57.670
Daphne can move in straight away.
You and Daphne.

04:57.879 --> 04:59.338
Great.

05:03.217 --> 05:05.303
- Oh, hello, Niles.
- Frasier, where's Daphne?

05:05.511 --> 05:07.305
I think at the market.

05:07.471 --> 05:08.556
Hello, Dad.

05:08.764 --> 05:10.016
Frasier, about this afternoon...

05:10.224 --> 05:12.393
Look, let's just drop it, all right?

05:12.560 --> 05:13.978
All's well that ends well,

05:14.603 --> 05:16.856
and this afternoon ended
very well indeed.

05:17.064 --> 05:19.150
Your underwear model called?

05:19.316 --> 05:20.526
Just after you left, actually.

05:20.693 --> 05:23.362
We spoke for about an hour,
and we're having dinner together

05:23.529 --> 05:24.697
on Saturday night.

05:24.905 --> 05:26.907
Well, that's great.
I hope everything works out.

05:27.116 --> 05:28.534
Actually, Dad, on that score,

05:28.701 --> 05:31.036
you could make yourself scarce
that night.

05:31.203 --> 05:34.039
Well, actually, I'm moving in
with Niles for a couple of months.

05:34.248 --> 05:36.709
Well, have some confidence
in me, Dad.

05:36.876 --> 05:38.878
It won't take me that long.

05:40.921 --> 05:43.799
No, no. No, no, I mean it.
Niles and I have been talking about it.

05:43.966 --> 05:46.176
Yes, and I think it's a fine idea.

05:46.385 --> 05:47.886
I know I've been out of sorts lately,

05:48.053 --> 05:49.638
I hope I haven't made
you feel unwanted.

05:49.805 --> 05:51.432
No, no, it's nothing like that.

05:51.598 --> 05:54.852
Listen, I've been living under your roof
for five years now.

05:55.060 --> 05:56.854
You've earned a little time
to yourself.

05:57.062 --> 05:58.897
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

05:59.106 --> 06:02.109
- Maybe you should sleep on it tonight.
- Frasier, Frasier, please. Look.

06:02.317 --> 06:04.820
You've had a chance to get closer
to Dad these past few years,

06:04.987 --> 06:07.030
and I wouldn't mind having
that same chance myself.

06:07.197 --> 06:09.408
Frankly, I'm a bit jealous.

06:13.537 --> 06:16.331
Well, I am sorry, Niles.

06:16.498 --> 06:18.542
I guess I haven't been seeing this
from your angle.

06:18.750 --> 06:21.461
- Hello, all.
- Hello, Daphne.

06:21.628 --> 06:24.381
Quite a little angle it is too.

06:24.590 --> 06:27.551
Let me ask you something. How would
you feel about moving in with Niles?

06:27.759 --> 06:29.011
- You serious?
- Yes.

06:29.219 --> 06:34.141
- Just me?
- Yes. No, no, and Dad.

06:35.392 --> 06:37.144
Just till Frasier goes back to work.

06:37.310 --> 06:39.312
It's been a little crowded
around here.

06:39.521 --> 06:41.148
Well, I won't argue with that.

06:41.314 --> 06:43.233
You know,
Dr. Crane has quite a few stairs.

06:43.400 --> 06:45.735
- Are you sure you can manage them?
- Oh, sure.

06:45.902 --> 06:48.405
Nobody knows better than you
how well my hip's getting.

06:48.613 --> 06:52.284
Well, what are we waiting for?
Here, let's get you packed.

06:52.450 --> 06:53.994
Wait a minute.

06:55.328 --> 06:58.623
I was hired
as Mr. Crane's physical therapist,

06:58.790 --> 07:01.209
and if he can make it up and down
that staircase of yours,

07:01.376 --> 07:04.129
he really doesn't need
full-time care anymore.

07:06.840 --> 07:11.261
This is hard for me to say,
but maybe it's time I moved on.

07:13.805 --> 07:16.391
We all knew this day
would come sooner or later.

07:16.599 --> 07:18.476
What about my exercises?

07:18.893 --> 07:21.104
You'll do fine on your own.

07:21.271 --> 07:24.983
Believe me, it's not that I want to go.
I'm very fond of you all.

07:25.191 --> 07:26.818
I'm not like a psychiatrist,

07:26.985 --> 07:29.487
who works with someone
for years and years

07:29.654 --> 07:32.907
and it doesn't matter
if they ever get better.

07:38.246 --> 07:41.374
My work here is done.
I have to go where I'm needed.

07:41.541 --> 07:43.334
- Well, we need you.
- Dad needs you.

07:43.501 --> 07:45.795
Look, it's not like I'm leaving
right this minute.

07:45.962 --> 07:48.840
I'll help you get settled in
while I look for a new job.

07:49.048 --> 07:50.383
- But, Daphne...
- Oh, please,

07:50.591 --> 07:53.511
don't make a big fuss about this.
You'll just make me cry.

07:53.719 --> 07:54.971
This is no time for tears.

07:55.138 --> 07:57.306
Well, I guess you know what's best.

07:57.473 --> 08:00.476
It's sure gonna be Ionely though,
just the two of us.

08:00.643 --> 08:04.522
It won't just be the two of you,
you'll have Eddie.

08:27.211 --> 08:30.548
- Dad.
- Eddie, whatever you're on, get off.

08:33.092 --> 08:36.929
I've been on hold
with my employment agency forever.

08:37.096 --> 08:40.808
And thanks again for making me feel
so welcome here until I find a new job.

08:41.350 --> 08:43.102
Yes, I'm here.

08:43.309 --> 08:46.647
Nothing at all?
Not even part-time therapy?

08:46.814 --> 08:49.233
Well, I'll stay in touch. Bye-bye.

08:50.192 --> 08:52.528
So no job yet, eh?

08:52.736 --> 08:54.154
No, unfortunately.

08:54.321 --> 08:58.242
Still, tragedies happen every day.
I mustn't give up hope.

09:01.036 --> 09:02.746
I wish you'd consider
staying here with us.

09:02.913 --> 09:04.998
I don't know how Dad's gonna
manage without you.

09:05.207 --> 09:06.333
He doesn't need me anymore.

09:06.500 --> 09:08.210
Nonsense.
I know he puts on a brave front,

09:08.377 --> 09:10.796
but the plain truth is,
the man is practically an invalid.

09:10.963 --> 09:13.132
All right, come back here.

09:13.298 --> 09:14.842
- What's he got now?
- Oh, my sneaker.

09:15.008 --> 09:16.051
You give me that back

09:16.218 --> 09:19.054
or I'm not taking you
for your speed walk.

09:21.306 --> 09:23.016
- Oh, hi, Frasier.
- Hi, Dad. Hi, Niles.

09:23.183 --> 09:26.019
Forgive me, I know how annoying
it can be to drop by without calling.

09:26.186 --> 09:27.604
Oh, don't worry, I used to do it.

09:27.813 --> 09:29.398
That's how I know. Hello, Eddie.

09:30.607 --> 09:34.778
I've got a surprise for you, something
you left at the house. There we are.

09:42.703 --> 09:45.705
Don't worry, Niles,
you'll get used to it.

09:46.540 --> 09:51.336
Oh, and, Dad, I've got a little surprise
for you as well.

09:51.503 --> 09:53.004
All right, boys, bring it on in here.

09:53.171 --> 09:57.092
Oh, great, here it is. Now this place
is starting to look like home.

09:57.259 --> 09:59.469
Yes, and finally so is mine.

09:59.678 --> 10:01.346
Well, I'm just gonna go
finish unpacking.

10:01.513 --> 10:03.056
Well, you just follow him up
with that.

10:03.223 --> 10:04.307
Oh, no, no, leave it there.

10:04.474 --> 10:07.727
That way I won't get my pizza cheese
all over your fancy chairs.

10:07.894 --> 10:09.688
Doesn't the cheese
go in your mouth?

10:09.896 --> 10:12.983
That's certainly the goal, but you can't
hit that bull's-eye every time.

10:14.651 --> 10:17.070
Okay, this isn't working out.
You have to take him back now.

10:17.278 --> 10:19.322
- He's been here for eight hours.
- I don't care.

10:19.531 --> 10:21.950
I only signed on for this because
Daphne came in the bargain

10:22.117 --> 10:24.327
and she's leaving.
You have to help me, I'm desperate.

10:24.536 --> 10:27.038
Niles, which wall should I hang
my swordfish on?

10:27.205 --> 10:31.376
None of them,
I just had that room frescoed.

10:32.794 --> 10:35.129
- Daph.
- Thanks, Rhonda, you're a lifesaver.

10:35.296 --> 10:36.839
Bye-bye.

10:37.006 --> 10:38.591
Well, good news
on the employment front?

10:38.758 --> 10:40.802
Yes, a friend of mine
just got me an interview.

10:41.010 --> 10:44.305
It's an elderly woman suffering from
brittle bone disease, the poor thing.

10:44.514 --> 10:46.891
Oh, well, normally I'd say
break a leg but...

10:48.017 --> 10:51.646
Oh, I'm gonna miss you. All of you.

10:51.813 --> 10:55.400
But like I told your brother,
there's simply no reason for me to stay

10:55.566 --> 10:57.902
as long as your father's
so strong and healthy.

11:00.530 --> 11:02.490
Oh, dear God.

11:03.616 --> 11:05.952
- Oh, my God, Dad.
- Oh, are you all right?

11:06.119 --> 11:07.578
- Yeah.
- What happened? Come on.

11:07.745 --> 11:11.082
- I don't know. L...
- Oh, we just got tangled up there.

11:11.290 --> 11:12.667
- Dad, I am so sorry.
- Oh, my God.

11:12.833 --> 11:14.752
Oh, don't worry about it,
it was an accident.

11:14.919 --> 11:16.837
Well, you do seem
to be in one piece.

11:17.046 --> 11:19.715
Still, it was an awfully big fall.
Would you help me get some ice?

11:19.882 --> 11:22.760
Good thinking, Daphne.
I know I could use a drink.

11:25.137 --> 11:27.515
- Boy, that was so weird.
- Yeah.

11:27.682 --> 11:31.018
Niles just kicked my cane out
right from under me.

11:35.272 --> 11:37.274
Yeah, I know he wants
to keep Daphne around here

11:37.441 --> 11:39.485
but I didn't think he'd go that far.

11:40.236 --> 11:41.737
Well, no, not deliberately,

11:41.904 --> 11:45.533
but maybe he was acting
on an unconscious level.

11:45.741 --> 11:48.035
What are you talking about?
I was just making a joke.

11:48.536 --> 11:51.372
- Oh, well, then just skip it, Dad.
- No, no, wait a minute.

11:51.539 --> 11:53.874
You think Niles was actually
trying to hurt me?

11:54.083 --> 11:59.463
No, no, it's just that sometimes,
when the motivation is strong enough,

11:59.630 --> 12:01.799
the unconscious can cause a person
to act in ways

12:01.966 --> 12:03.842
that the conscious
would find unthinkable.

12:04.051 --> 12:06.553
So you're saying that this
wasn't an accident?

12:07.388 --> 12:11.100
Oh, it's a crazy theory.
I'm sorry I even brought it up.

12:11.308 --> 12:14.686
You know what?
I think I'll be off now.

12:14.853 --> 12:16.522
Off to my bachelor pad.

12:16.688 --> 12:20.150
I have a date tonight
with a lingerie model.

12:20.317 --> 12:22.986
Well, bachelor pad, lingerie model.

12:23.153 --> 12:26.323
The sweetest words
in the English language.

12:26.823 --> 12:28.033
I'm sorry I won't be there.

12:28.242 --> 12:31.078
Wait, we have a tie.

12:32.162 --> 12:33.205
Frasier...

12:33.413 --> 12:36.249
All right, Mr. Crane, I need you
to take a seat so I can ice your hip.

12:36.416 --> 12:39.378
I'm fine. Why is everybody
making such a big fuss?

12:39.586 --> 12:41.588
- Wait, don't sit down.
- What?

12:41.755 --> 12:44.174
- You nearly impaled yourself.
- Oh, my God.

12:44.341 --> 12:47.010
Oh, thank you, Daphne. I don't know
what it is about these things,

12:47.177 --> 12:50.097
they keep ending up
in the oddest places.

13:32.013 --> 13:33.765
<i>Hi, Frasier, it's Rebecca.</i>

13:33.932 --> 13:36.434
<i>Your voice sounds so sexy
on your machine.</i>

13:36.601 --> 13:40.063
<i>Anyway, I loved talking to you
this afternoon, and I was thinking,</i>

13:40.230 --> 13:44.192
<i>instead of going to a noisy restaurant,
maybe we could just stay in tonight,</i>

13:44.359 --> 13:47.779
<i>open some wine,
curl up in front of the fire.</i>

13:47.946 --> 13:48.988
<i>Just a warning though,</i>

13:49.155 --> 13:52.992
<i>I'm coming straight from a shoot
so I'll be wearing my work clothes.</i>

13:53.159 --> 13:56.788
<i>I can't believe I said that. Bye.</i>

14:22.104 --> 14:24.315
<i>Hi, Frasier, it's Rebecca.</i>

14:24.523 --> 14:26.484
<i>Your voice sounds so sexy
on your machine.</i>

14:26.651 --> 14:29.278
<i>Anyway, I loved talking...</i>

14:31.989 --> 14:34.909
Boy, the floors around here
are so slippery.

14:35.076 --> 14:37.912
- Yes, I just had them polished.
- Well, I wish you would've told me.

14:38.079 --> 14:40.373
Eddie just slid into a wall
and chipped his tooth.

14:42.208 --> 14:44.835
Now he whistles when he breathes.

14:47.755 --> 14:50.800
Well, Dad, I can assure you,
there'll be no slipping in here.

14:50.966 --> 14:54.678
Look, a brand-new safety rail
installed just for you.

14:54.845 --> 14:58.182
And, as requested, traction decals.

14:58.390 --> 15:00.893
Well, I don't need to worry
about falling in...

15:03.562 --> 15:04.605
Dad, are you okay?

15:04.772 --> 15:06.940
Wow, yeah. It's a good thing
I wasn't in the shower,

15:07.107 --> 15:09.276
- I could've cracked my head open.
- Oh, Dad...

15:09.443 --> 15:12.112
I guess I'm not much
of a handyman, am I?

15:15.866 --> 15:17.826
You put this thing up yourself?

15:17.993 --> 15:20.287
Yes, my contractor was out of town.
Don't worry,

15:20.746 --> 15:23.332
you can use my bathroom to shower.
Just let me know when you do.

15:23.499 --> 15:26.001
The plumbing's temperamental,
if I were to run the dishwasher,

15:26.168 --> 15:28.212
you might be horribly scalded.

15:28.629 --> 15:30.881
You know, I took an extra-Iong shower
yesterday.

15:31.048 --> 15:33.217
You know, that ought to hold me.

15:36.845 --> 15:39.681
- You sure you don't need a hand?
- Just keep moving.

15:42.059 --> 15:43.185
Guess what.

15:43.393 --> 15:46.313
I got the job. I can't believe it,
I start in the morning.

15:46.480 --> 15:48.482
- You what?
- I'll tell you about it later.

15:48.648 --> 15:52.152
I have to call my employment agency
right away.

15:56.823 --> 16:00.452
- I can't let her leave. I just can't.
- There's nothing we can do about it.

16:00.911 --> 16:02.871
I still have a day.

16:03.622 --> 16:05.123
Just have to be more resourceful.

16:05.332 --> 16:06.750
Like how?

16:08.585 --> 16:12.797
It's my problem, not yours.
I just have to think.

16:13.006 --> 16:15.175
Fresh air.
Maybe that'll calm me down.

16:15.342 --> 16:18.345
Oh, look at the sunset.

16:18.553 --> 16:22.098
Dad, come join me on the balcony.

16:23.683 --> 16:27.354
Eddie, get out of here, quick.
Come on, come on, come on.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.105
Come on.

16:52.837 --> 16:54.422
Dad!

16:55.131 --> 16:57.383
- Lord, what are you doing here?
- Look, we gotta talk.

16:57.550 --> 17:00.261
- Now? Not a good time.
- But it's getting spooky over at Niles'.

17:00.428 --> 17:02.096
I know it's unsettling
the way he changes

17:02.263 --> 17:05.183
into that Chinese dressing gown
after dinner, but you'll get used to it.

17:05.349 --> 17:07.477
No, I think his unconscious
is trying to hurt me.

17:07.643 --> 17:09.395
- Dad, that's preposterous.
- No, it isn't.

17:09.604 --> 17:11.189
Can't we talk about this
in the morning?

17:11.355 --> 17:14.483
There is no way your own flesh
and blood would try to hurt you.

17:14.650 --> 17:15.734
I'm sorry.

17:15.902 --> 17:18.738
Well, at least let me get Eddie's pillow
out of my room, will you?

17:18.905 --> 17:21.365
All right, but just hurry it up, will you?

17:32.835 --> 17:34.629
Daphne.

17:36.380 --> 17:37.632
What is going on?

17:37.798 --> 17:39.550
I hope I'm not catching you
at a bad time.

17:39.759 --> 17:42.803
- Well, actually, I'm waiting for a date.
- Well, I'll just run in and out.

17:42.970 --> 17:45.765
I need to pick up my exercise mat.

17:45.973 --> 17:48.267
Oh, good Lord.
Is everything all right?

17:48.434 --> 17:52.313
I'm sorry, I think I'm just a bit nervous
about my new job.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.940
- Yes, yes.
- I'll be all right.

17:55.107 --> 17:57.651
I just wish I didn't miss
being here so much.

17:57.818 --> 17:59.069
Oh, Daphne.

17:59.278 --> 18:02.656
Oh, I'm sorry.
Listen, you're gonna be just fine.

18:02.823 --> 18:05.367
You know,
transitions are always difficult.

18:05.534 --> 18:08.078
The trick is just not to rush them.

18:21.717 --> 18:23.594
Niles!

18:24.261 --> 18:25.637
What the hell are you doing here?

18:25.804 --> 18:27.097
I'm going out of my mind.

18:27.264 --> 18:29.641
I am this close to living under
the same roof with Daphne...

18:29.808 --> 18:31.435
Before you go on,
let me say one thing.

18:31.643 --> 18:32.686
- What is it?
- Get out.

18:32.853 --> 18:35.772
- Wait, wait, I need to talk about this.
- Is that Niles?

18:35.981 --> 18:38.817
Dad, hey, why did you run off?
I've been looking for you everywhere.

18:38.984 --> 18:40.611
- No, Niles, stay away from me.
- What?

18:40.819 --> 18:43.071
Now, Niles, I'm not mad at you,
just your unconscious.

18:43.238 --> 18:46.283
It wants Daphne to stay around so bad
that it's been trying to hurt me.

18:46.491 --> 18:49.077
- What?
- Well, Frasier can explain it better.

18:49.911 --> 18:53.206
Exactly who is hurting whom, and what
does any of this have to do with...?

18:54.458 --> 18:57.586
- Daphne.
- Oh, look, we're all together again,

18:57.753 --> 19:01.506
- just like old times.
- Oh, dear. Oh, God.

19:01.673 --> 19:03.925
Well, we certainly do
have a lot to talk about.

19:04.092 --> 19:06.595
Tell you what, let's meet at Niles'
for breakfast tomorrow.

19:06.762 --> 19:08.430
I'm not getting in the elevator
with him.

19:08.597 --> 19:10.307
Dad, Daphne, go in shifts then.
You first.

19:10.474 --> 19:11.766
- All right.
- Go on.

19:11.933 --> 19:14.102
Eddie, you too.
Shake a leg, mister, let's go.

19:14.269 --> 19:17.856
- Right now, out of here.
- Move it, move it, move it.

19:20.233 --> 19:22.986
You actually convinced Dad
I was trying to harm him?

19:23.194 --> 19:24.279
Niles, I did no such thing.

19:24.446 --> 19:27.198
I simply advanced a theory.
I had no idea he would take it to heart.

19:27.407 --> 19:29.326
- Oh, balderdash.
- Oh, please, Niles.

19:29.492 --> 19:30.660
Surely it's occurred to you,

19:30.827 --> 19:33.705
your desire for Daphne is forcing
you to behave in very strange ways.

19:33.872 --> 19:36.541
Or do you shove Dad
down the stairs every day?

19:36.750 --> 19:38.460
- That was an accident!
- Oh, Niles,

19:38.626 --> 19:41.713
any psychiatrist worth his salt knows
that there are no accidents.

19:42.172 --> 19:44.549
No one would do something like that,
however unconsciously,

19:44.716 --> 19:47.051
unless they stood to gain from it.

19:47.510 --> 19:49.304
Oh, dear.

19:49.721 --> 19:51.014
Oh, my God.

19:51.181 --> 19:54.142
Oh, thank God. We're here to help.

19:54.309 --> 19:56.311
What did you kick my cane for?

19:56.519 --> 19:58.521
It was an accident.
I was playing with Eddie.

19:58.730 --> 19:59.897
My hip's killing me.

20:00.064 --> 20:01.316
Dad, don't worry about it.

20:01.524 --> 20:03.985
Niles has a nice comfy bed
you can recuperate in.

20:04.193 --> 20:05.862
I can't go up and down
those stairs now!

20:06.070 --> 20:08.239
The best thing would be for him
to stay with you.

20:08.448 --> 20:10.908
He'll need full-time attention.
I'll cancel my job...

20:11.117 --> 20:12.285
All right, just hold it!

20:12.452 --> 20:14.495
Nobody's cancelling anything.

20:14.704 --> 20:16.247
The man fell down stairs today.

20:16.414 --> 20:19.584
He could hardly have been hurt worse
stumbling in a carpeted hallway.

20:19.792 --> 20:22.128
All right, now get up, you big crybaby.
No pain, no gain.

20:22.295 --> 20:25.047
- Oh, no, but it hurts!
- Boohoo, I want you out of here.

20:25.256 --> 20:27.842
I don't care if you have to crawl
like a bog turtle.

20:29.677 --> 20:31.554
Rebecca.

20:32.471 --> 20:34.390
I didn't see you standing there.

20:36.058 --> 20:37.727
Why don't you just step on
over my father,

20:37.893 --> 20:39.312
help yourself to some wine?

20:39.520 --> 20:42.273
What kind of a heartless bastard
are you?

20:42.481 --> 20:45.526
No, Rebecca, you don't understand.
It's not the way it looks.

20:45.735 --> 20:49.613
He's very resilient.
He's been shot before.

20:53.159 --> 20:56.162
Dr. Crane,
we really should get him inside.

20:56.328 --> 21:01.375
Yes, just give me a moment.

21:32.322 --> 21:33.782
All right, bring him in.
