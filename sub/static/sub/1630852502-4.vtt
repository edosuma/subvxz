WEBVTT

00:00.320 --> 00:02.123
The state controls the universities.

00:02.148 --> 00:03.953
And I am an enemy of the state.

00:05.171 --> 00:07.875
There is no paper trail
because of who I am.

00:08.593 --> 00:09.960
My place later?

00:10.028 --> 00:11.395
You've got a second chance.

00:11.509 --> 00:13.848
You should think about
how you're gonna use it.

00:23.173 --> 00:24.440
You're in Idlib?

00:24.471 --> 00:28.062
Kafr Halab. The building
collapsed this morning.

00:28.102 --> 00:29.516
Bombs last night.

00:29.541 --> 00:30.965
And we're looking for survivors.

00:30.990 --> 00:32.398
How many of you on site, Saleh?

00:32.423 --> 00:35.195
We're small team. Most
are trainees like me.

00:35.242 --> 00:37.015
And what sort of equipment do you have?

00:37.095 --> 00:39.508
The usual, basic first aid.

00:39.533 --> 00:40.820
It's good you called.

00:41.021 --> 00:44.258
You need to manage hemorrhagic
shock so he's safe to transport.

00:44.283 --> 00:47.656
Can someone find a... a
sheet or towel to wrap him?

00:51.643 --> 00:54.773
Place your hands on his
pelvis and compress inwards.

00:55.312 --> 00:57.062
Feel around for movement.

01:02.299 --> 01:04.093
They found a regime flag.

01:15.162 --> 01:16.352
Planes?

01:16.377 --> 01:17.969
Saleh, do you need to get out of there?

01:17.994 --> 01:19.695
Just passing over, I hope.

01:21.673 --> 01:24.469
How is... How is Zaynab?

01:26.255 --> 01:27.617
We will be getting married.

01:29.901 --> 01:32.051
Good for you. Poor her.

01:37.717 --> 01:38.930
His radial is strong.

01:38.955 --> 01:40.588
We need to keep looking.

01:40.613 --> 01:42.914
More bodies might be trapped in rubble.

01:43.609 --> 01:46.805
- Thank you, Bashir.
- Be safe, if you need...

01:48.124 --> 01:50.487
- Oh. Is everything okay?
- Yes, thank you.

02:24.322 --> 02:27.736
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

02:39.180 --> 02:40.526
I'm gonna take it.

02:40.956 --> 02:42.890
Wait, wait, wait.

02:44.309 --> 02:46.000
I know what that means.

02:46.149 --> 02:48.669
Dr. Singh says if you're not early...

02:49.182 --> 02:50.922
you're late, so...

02:51.928 --> 02:54.175
Well, your boss got no joy in his life.

02:54.482 --> 02:56.927
He's a surgeon. We're not
exactly known for joy.

02:59.105 --> 03:00.472
Dinner later?

03:00.497 --> 03:03.059
Maybe. Don't forget to hold for five.

03:22.470 --> 03:23.784
Everything alright?

03:23.809 --> 03:25.204
<i>A grade four student</i>

03:25.229 --> 03:27.600
<i>in your household, Abigail
Hunter, was marked</i>

03:27.625 --> 03:29.401
<i>absent at morning attendance.</i>

03:29.426 --> 03:31.526
I call the school, it goes
straight to voicemail.

03:31.962 --> 03:33.878
Mel texted me after the drop off,

03:33.903 --> 03:36.470
so I know Abby's there, or should be.

03:36.495 --> 03:38.122
I called Mel, but she's not picking up.

03:38.147 --> 03:40.589
She has meetings all day, so
she might have her phone off.

03:40.614 --> 03:42.849
I'll cover your patients.
You do what you need to do.

03:43.928 --> 03:45.476
Thank you.

03:46.610 --> 03:49.103
Why would I get a message from
them saying you drop her off?

03:49.128 --> 03:50.565
<i>I don't know, the school didn't call me</i>

03:50.590 --> 03:52.182
<i>so this is the first time
I'm hearing about this.</i>

03:52.207 --> 03:54.465
<i>- Did you call back?</i>
- It went to voicemail.

03:54.490 --> 03:58.167
Look. When you dropped Abby
off, you saw her go in?

03:58.192 --> 04:00.815
<i>I left her in the yard with her
friends five minutes before the bell,</i>

04:00.840 --> 04:02.909
When <i>she's been begging</i>
ff, <i>for this for months.</i>

04:02.934 --> 04:05.502
If we're making a decision like that,
shouldn't we have discussed it

04:05.527 --> 04:08.002
Well you're not here. So you don't get
to tell me how to drop the kids off.

04:08.027 --> 04:09.260
Look, I'm worried, okay?

04:09.285 --> 04:12.065
Because if you didn't watch her go in,

04:12.090 --> 04:14.325
doesn't that mean she
could actually be gone?

04:14.350 --> 04:15.551
<i>I'm worried too.</i>

04:15.576 --> 04:16.634
<i>I'm already in the car.</i>

04:16.659 --> 04:18.259
<i>I'll call you when I get there</i>

04:26.354 --> 04:29.435
Messy hair, flushed cheeks,
and almost smiling?

04:29.460 --> 04:31.135
I wonder who the guy is.

04:31.220 --> 04:33.167
Maybe she just overslept?

04:33.691 --> 04:35.212
- No judgment.
- No.

04:35.237 --> 04:36.487
Respect, actually.

04:36.512 --> 04:38.644
It's basically impossible
to make a relationship work

04:38.669 --> 04:40.292
- around this job.
- You don't date?

04:41.088 --> 04:43.537
I've... I've had to accept

04:43.562 --> 04:46.463
the fact that the hospital
is my current boyfriend.

04:46.488 --> 04:47.643
You?

04:47.668 --> 04:50.596
I sleep on a sofa so my
sister can have a bedroom.

04:50.916 --> 04:54.065
MVC 3 minutes out. Code trauma. VSA.

04:54.686 --> 04:56.954
Hit-and-run. Victim's not identified.

04:57.213 --> 04:59.410
Driver of the vehicle,
head injury, GCS 6,

04:59.434 --> 05:02.144
massive blood loss, ***, resus
on the field 8 minutes ago.

05:02.169 --> 05:04.602
Passenger. Airbag
malfunctioned, didn't deploy.

05:04.627 --> 05:06.964
Cyanosed, 02 sats at 80 percent.

05:07.153 --> 05:11.159
Pulse 120, resp rate 35, BP 95 on 68

05:11.184 --> 05:13.065
Bed one. Dr. Hamed.

05:15.235 --> 05:16.948
Dr. Leblanc, bed two.

05:19.630 --> 05:21.276
One, two, three.

05:23.137 --> 05:24.706
It's all yours, doctors.

05:24.731 --> 05:26.074
Arnold take compressions.

05:26.099 --> 05:29.058
Activate MTP, and insert
two large boreVs.

05:29.296 --> 05:31.519
ABCs, doctor.

05:32.205 --> 05:35.172
Uh, I'll intubate and decompress
the chest bilaterally.

05:35.197 --> 05:36.956
One, two, three.

05:40.255 --> 05:42.323
We need two units O-neg.

05:42.348 --> 05:46.128
Mags, an eFAST, and I need an art line.

05:48.278 --> 05:51.280
EMS radioed from dispatch, we have IDs.

05:51.305 --> 05:53.534
Marie Tabeh, 46, Ana Tabeh, 20.

05:53.559 --> 05:55.190
This is a mother, daughter?

06:01.057 --> 06:03.392
Pneumothorax. We need a chest tube!

06:03.417 --> 06:04.917
Use a 28 French in case
there's a hemothorax.

06:04.942 --> 06:08.144
Let's sedate with ketamine, she
needs 40mg, let's start her.

06:09.895 --> 06:11.229
Still no pulse.

06:11.254 --> 06:13.388
There's cardiac activity
on the ultrasound,

06:13.413 --> 06:15.440
but her heart looks empty.
1mg epinephrine.

06:15.898 --> 06:18.815
Epi won't help if there's no
blood for the heart to pump.

06:18.840 --> 06:21.942
PEA, narrow complex. Not
a shockable rhythm.

06:21.967 --> 06:25.519
Restart compressions. Let's focus on
resuscitation using blood product.

06:26.797 --> 06:29.128
Preparing for chest
tube, making incision..

06:29.783 --> 06:31.451
Test.

06:32.839 --> 06:35.261
Get your finger in the pleural space.

06:36.569 --> 06:39.441
- What are you feeling?
- Smooth pleural...

06:40.109 --> 06:41.901
Lung. I think I'm good.

06:41.926 --> 06:43.737
Chest tube.

06:56.878 --> 06:58.644
Hemopneumo.

07:00.236 --> 07:02.026
Left foot is cold.

07:03.065 --> 07:04.599
No pulse.

07:04.854 --> 07:07.081
Her knee looks pretty mangled.
This could be vascular injury.

07:07.106 --> 07:10.003
Page vascular. She's gonna need the OR.

07:11.149 --> 07:12.948
Still no pulse!

07:13.404 --> 07:16.042
No cardiac or electrical activity.

07:16.849 --> 07:19.284
Okay. I think that's it.

07:19.369 --> 07:21.470
You think? Or you know.

07:21.859 --> 07:23.183
I know.

07:23.694 --> 07:25.144
So you're confident.

07:25.601 --> 07:26.987
Yes.

07:28.753 --> 07:31.714
Asystole, no cardiac
activity on ultrasound,

07:31.739 --> 07:33.028
prolonged downtime.

07:33.053 --> 07:36.027
We managed *** cause of
traumatic cardiac arrest.

07:36.052 --> 07:39.697
3 units packed cells, bilaterally
chest decompression.

07:39.722 --> 07:42.222
No pericardial effusion,
and a stable pelvis.

07:42.589 --> 07:45.425
I'm confident that after the massive
head injuries suffered by this patient

07:45.450 --> 07:47.217
she had no chance.

07:48.892 --> 07:50.192
Then call it.

07:50.217 --> 07:52.284
Time of Death, 10:14 AM.

07:52.714 --> 07:54.112
Thank you, everyone.

07:54.526 --> 07:57.401
Let's just take a moment to
acknowledge the end of a life

07:58.560 --> 08:00.925
and the efforts of our team to save it.

08:15.976 --> 08:18.235
Sir? About what just happened.

08:18.727 --> 08:21.501
Being challenged? Consider
it the new normal.

08:21.569 --> 08:23.594
Are you talking about
how I ran that trauma?

08:23.619 --> 08:25.665
I'm talking about you telling legal

08:25.690 --> 08:27.915
that you can't get us your transcripts.

08:28.657 --> 08:31.228
Do you know what a lawyer hears
when you say enemy of the state?

08:31.253 --> 08:32.703
They hear liability,

08:32.821 --> 08:35.649
that puts the pressure on us to
make certain that you are not.

08:36.011 --> 08:39.248
I need you to be above reproach.
Sharper than everyone else.

08:39.273 --> 08:41.094
Hi, Jasmine Weber, peds two.

08:41.119 --> 08:43.179
- Thanks.
- Where's Doctor Hunter?

08:43.205 --> 08:45.541
I asked to take a couple extra patients.

08:45.809 --> 08:47.376
Staying sharp.

08:48.158 --> 08:49.858
Let's see.

08:52.712 --> 08:55.318
Can you tell me what happened Mr.
Monroe?

08:55.506 --> 08:58.420
Kinda stupid. My fault, really.

08:58.682 --> 09:00.748
I've been trying to lose a few pounds

09:00.773 --> 09:03.615
so I hid the cookies up in the cupboard.

09:03.738 --> 09:05.318
I got a craving,

09:05.343 --> 09:08.060
so I climbed up on a stool to get them,

09:08.194 --> 09:09.761
and bam!

09:09.786 --> 09:11.654
I didn't want to come
all the way down here

09:11.679 --> 09:14.498
but the boss insisted when
she got back from work.

09:15.146 --> 09:16.521
Are you a nurse?

09:16.546 --> 09:19.006
Nurse's aide. At a retirement home.

09:19.031 --> 09:20.618
I work the night shift.

09:20.643 --> 09:23.857
You're not supposed to call it
the graveyard shift, there.

09:23.882 --> 09:26.342
I get home and he's white as a sheet,

09:26.367 --> 09:28.935
can barely stand from
the pain, but it's all,

09:28.960 --> 09:30.873
"No, no, I'm fine."

09:31.603 --> 09:33.177
She worries.

09:33.202 --> 09:35.403
Only because she cares.

09:35.885 --> 09:37.818
We should all be so lucky.

09:38.664 --> 09:40.576
It's gonna be cold.

09:44.912 --> 09:47.180
Okay, well, I'm seeing some fluid here,

09:47.205 --> 09:49.826
so this could be an indication
of internal bleeding.

09:49.851 --> 09:53.177
- You'll need a CT.
- If you say so, Doc.

10:00.477 --> 10:03.607
We need to bring him to
the resus room, stat!

10:05.361 --> 10:07.606
Then she lost control of her legs.

10:07.731 --> 10:10.568
I needed the neighbour to
help me get her to the car.

10:10.593 --> 10:12.193
Should I have called an ambulance?

10:12.239 --> 10:14.807
No, the important thing
is that you're here now.

10:17.609 --> 10:19.514
How old are you, Jasmine?

10:20.424 --> 10:22.123
Thirteen.

10:22.210 --> 10:24.911
And can you tell me when you
started feeling this way?

10:25.315 --> 10:26.740
Earlier today.

10:26.765 --> 10:29.951
It started with a little
slurring, and then it got worse.

10:35.006 --> 10:37.662
Did you take any drugs or alcohol?

10:38.874 --> 10:41.443
Any issues swallowing? Headaches?

10:44.108 --> 10:46.145
Can you do this for me?

10:55.160 --> 10:56.560
That's great.

10:56.585 --> 10:58.627
Any indications leading to today?

10:58.652 --> 11:00.223
Cognitive or behavioural?

11:00.248 --> 11:02.231
Can I talk to you outside?

11:07.715 --> 11:09.516
I'm her foster mother.

11:09.921 --> 11:12.222
I've only had Jasmine a few weeks.

11:12.394 --> 11:15.254
Do you have any family medical history?

11:15.279 --> 11:17.213
Specifically, I'm looking for a history

11:17.238 --> 11:18.809
of heart disease or strokes.

11:18.834 --> 11:20.297
You think she's having a stroke?

11:20.322 --> 11:22.660
With slurred speech and
loss of motor function,

11:22.685 --> 11:24.317
that's the first thing to rule out.

11:24.342 --> 11:27.543
Well, she's been in a series of
group homes for the past two yes.

11:27.681 --> 11:29.615
She ran away from the last one.

11:29.640 --> 11:31.879
That's all the information
the foster agency had.

11:31.904 --> 11:33.785
I barely know her at all.

11:38.203 --> 11:41.254
For labs, you want a
CBC and electrolytes?

11:41.279 --> 11:44.098
Um... Also venous gas,

11:44.123 --> 11:46.356
extended lytes, CK,

11:46.381 --> 11:49.164
liver panel, hemoglobin A1C.

11:49.189 --> 11:50.629
And get her to CT as soon as possible.

11:50.654 --> 11:52.012
Got it.

11:52.792 --> 11:55.326
So., uh, we'll do imaging

11:55.351 --> 11:57.098
and send blood work to the lab

11:57.123 --> 11:58.590
and see what's going on.

11:58.615 --> 12:01.250
In the meantime, just stay with her

12:01.275 --> 12:03.145
and keep her spirits up.

12:21.612 --> 12:23.079
Where's the rest of your team?

12:23.104 --> 12:24.801
<i>The building shifted again</i>

12:24.826 --> 12:27.301
<i>and they got stuck on a higher floor.</i>

12:27.470 --> 12:29.667
<i>We need your help.</i>

12:41.824 --> 12:43.391
Remember after your accident,

12:43.416 --> 12:46.518
we talked about you
having a second chance?

12:46.937 --> 12:49.390
I remember you talking about

12:49.438 --> 12:50.913
how I was coming out
of a coma at the time,

12:50.938 --> 12:52.562
so I wasn't saying much.

12:52.660 --> 12:55.689
Running down Bash like that
in trauma for no reason?

12:55.714 --> 12:57.982
If this is you trying
for a second chance,

12:58.057 --> 12:59.458
you're failing.

12:59.483 --> 13:01.258
I had a very good reason.

13:01.800 --> 13:03.367
I could take you through it.

13:04.991 --> 13:07.307
Over dinner.

13:07.930 --> 13:09.434
My place.

13:09.952 --> 13:13.359
Yeah, I thought we fished with
all that about five years ago.

13:13.632 --> 13:15.295
Anyway, I don't recall

13:15.320 --> 13:17.443
you ever actually making me dinner.

13:17.610 --> 13:19.043
I wanted to.

13:19.283 --> 13:22.446
I guess we both wanted things
that would not have worked.

13:23.122 --> 13:25.923
What are you doing, Jed?

13:26.400 --> 13:28.828
I mean, why now? After all this time.

13:28.982 --> 13:31.650
You're the one who keeps
talking about second chances.

13:32.840 --> 13:36.257
And you're the only one here who's
not afraid to tell me to piss off.

13:36.540 --> 13:37.819
So...

13:38.349 --> 13:39.630
Dinner?

13:39.798 --> 13:41.332
What's your answer?

13:44.199 --> 13:46.011
Piss off.

13:48.029 --> 13:50.718
How is her airway? Blood pressure?

13:52.914 --> 13:56.063
Before you move her, you
need to tourniquet her leg.

13:58.268 --> 13:59.851
See? You know your stuff, Saleh.

14:01.615 --> 14:04.335
I guess you don't have any blood.
Saline will have to do.

14:04.360 --> 14:07.170
*** her to a clinic as soon as possible.

14:07.195 --> 14:08.679
<i>How much saline for a child like this?</i>

14:15.646 --> 14:18.578
<i>Keep your phone on Bashir, please!</i>

14:29.495 --> 14:32.366
In a pediatric crush, uh,

14:32.391 --> 14:35.293
normal saline is 20, 20 ml per kg?

14:35.318 --> 14:37.405
We have a pediatric crush injury?
You should've paged me right away

14:37.430 --> 14:39.202
No, no, it's just hypothetical.

14:39.227 --> 14:42.518
- Something I came across in my reading.
- Uh, the saline dose is right.

14:42.543 --> 14:44.640
Watch closely for hyperkalemia.

14:44.665 --> 14:46.085
Thanks.

14:55.365 --> 14:58.317
Uh, why did you order a
CT for Jasmine Weber?

14:59.483 --> 15:02.161
The symptoms pointed to possible stroke

15:02.186 --> 15:03.419
because of the dysarthria.

15:03.444 --> 15:05.067
Did you call for a bedside glucose test?

15:05.092 --> 15:07.731
- No.
- Claire?

15:07.886 --> 15:10.721
I had blood sent to the lab.
Hemoglobin A1C.

15:10.746 --> 15:13.434
- Isn't that protocol?
- DKA can mimic stroke symptoms.

15:13.538 --> 15:16.173
Bedside glucose is the protocol
here for pediatric patients

15:16.198 --> 15:17.622
She won't open her eyes!

15:17.647 --> 15:19.014
Guys!

15:19.881 --> 15:22.629
Jasmine? Jasmine? Come on, Jasmine.

15:22.654 --> 15:24.591
Try and open your eyes for us.

15:27.320 --> 15:29.281
Glucose is 25. She's in DKA.

15:29.398 --> 15:32.618
- DKA? What is that?
- Diabetic ketoacidosis.

15:32.643 --> 15:34.325
She's going to need insulin therapy.

15:34.350 --> 15:35.833
I thought you said she
was having a stroke.

15:35.858 --> 15:37.718
The symptoms can be very similar.

15:37.743 --> 15:39.916
- She didn't tell me
- She probably didn't know.

15:48.529 --> 15:50.063
Hello.

15:50.932 --> 15:54.966
Um, the endoscopy showed
enlarged veins in the esophagus

15:54.991 --> 15:56.786
which ruptured from your fall.

15:57.160 --> 15:59.833
Subsequent tests, however, reveal...

15:59.959 --> 16:02.939
cirrhosis and liver failure.

16:04.866 --> 16:07.401
I'm sorry to tell you that
with this amount of damage,

16:07.426 --> 16:10.027
the chances of the liver
recovering on its own are slim.

16:10.225 --> 16:12.115
Is there anything we can do?

16:12.140 --> 16:13.622
We're starting medication now,

16:13.647 --> 16:16.953
but Walter will also need something
called a variceal ligation,

16:17.030 --> 16:19.123
which means a surgeon
uses rubber bands to stop

16:19.148 --> 16:20.750
the enlarged veins from bleeding.

16:21.838 --> 16:25.296
Long term though, a liver
transplant is your only option.

16:26.787 --> 16:29.222
That's what a lifetime
of drinking gets you.

16:30.105 --> 16:32.512
It's probably what I deserve.

16:32.947 --> 16:34.722
I'm sorry.

16:42.832 --> 16:44.399
Excuse me, doctor?

16:44.429 --> 16:47.526
- Yes?
- You mentioned a transplant.

16:47.825 --> 16:51.405
Does it jeopardize that,
him having been a drinker?

16:52.119 --> 16:55.989
Well, he would have to be sober
for a minimum of six months.

16:56.014 --> 16:57.557
He's four years sober.

16:57.582 --> 17:00.436
I'm six. We met in the program.

17:00.461 --> 17:02.749
I'm sorry to bring you such bad news.

17:03.890 --> 17:05.547
We've overcome a lot.

17:05.571 --> 17:07.508
We'll get through this. too.

17:11.630 --> 17:14.721
Let me guess. Jasmine Weber?

17:14.746 --> 17:16.012
Any luck?

17:16.038 --> 17:18.234
I called every contact
number that I could find,

17:18.260 --> 17:20.301
pieced together that she
lived with a grandmother

17:20.327 --> 17:22.560
until a few years ago when she passed.

17:22.585 --> 17:23.622
Of what?

17:23.647 --> 17:26.645
Heart attack. Apparently,
in front of Jasmine.

17:26.670 --> 17:28.551
Not sure that's something you get over.

17:28.577 --> 17:30.244
It isn't.

17:30.842 --> 17:33.778
Then she was abandoned by an
uncle, who's now in jail.

17:33.803 --> 17:36.638
Learned in the hard way
not to trust anyone.

17:37.016 --> 17:39.082
Any type 1 diabetes in the family?

17:39.107 --> 17:42.029
Medical records don't even start
until she was put in foster care.

17:42.054 --> 17:44.544
But she's one of the lucky ones.

17:44.569 --> 17:47.395
Most of the older kids don't find
someone conscientious like Liz

17:47.420 --> 17:48.720
to look out for them.

17:56.541 --> 17:59.543
Think we could speed walk a
variceal ligation into OR?

17:59.672 --> 18:01.206
What's his coag look like?

18:01.231 --> 18:03.815
Labs just came in. Mmm...

18:05.219 --> 18:07.356
Blood alcohol level 0.09?

18:07.832 --> 18:09.341
I couldn't smell it on him

18:09.366 --> 18:10.895
Might've been vodka.

18:10.920 --> 18:12.450
Is he cirrhotic?

18:12.960 --> 18:15.334
Yeah. The seasoned ones
know how to hide it.

18:15.359 --> 18:17.489
No, his fiancée says he's
been in recovery four years.

18:17.514 --> 18:19.915
Guess he slipped. They always do.

18:20.058 --> 18:22.989
I was so focused on the cirrhosis
I didn't question the X-ray.

18:23.014 --> 18:24.794
Look. Do you see anything?

18:25.896 --> 18:27.602
Fracture to the sternum,
none to the extremities.

18:27.627 --> 18:29.328
Trauma to the abdomen.

18:29.622 --> 18:32.356
- Was there any circular bruising?
- Yeah.

18:32.794 --> 18:34.934
Does this look like a
fall off a stool to you?

18:35.690 --> 18:38.067
That's a tough angle for a stool

18:39.211 --> 18:41.505
Could it be steering wheel trauma?

18:43.428 --> 18:45.618
My guess is that your drunk was driving.

18:45.643 --> 18:46.776
And, by the looks of it,

18:46.801 --> 18:49.067
may've been in a serious accident.

18:50.936 --> 18:53.396
The timeline tracks for that
hit-and-run we got this morning.

18:53.421 --> 18:56.372
The mother we lost. The
daughter, how's she doing?

18:56.397 --> 18:59.310
She'll pull through. No
thanks to that asshole.

19:00.529 --> 19:04.060
Well, even if he was in an accident,
doesn't make it a bad accident.

19:05.202 --> 19:07.029
You sure about that?

19:24.064 --> 19:25.927
<i>Okay. Have a look.</i>

19:25.952 --> 19:28.557
Okay, her pupils are dilated.
She's losing consciousness?

19:28.582 --> 19:29.782
<i>Yes, she is.</i>

19:29.807 --> 19:32.175
Okay. So we manage pain

19:32.200 --> 19:35.567
and get Fatima fluid resuscitation
or she risks kidney injury.

19:35.664 --> 19:38.145
She needs a field hospital.
You can't wait, Saleh.

19:38.170 --> 19:39.470
You need to get her out yourself.

19:39.495 --> 19:41.996
- I can't do this alone, Bashir.
- Yes, you can.

19:42.021 --> 19:44.302
Your adrenaline will give you strength.

19:53.696 --> 19:56.200
Lou! Hey! Hi.

19:56.263 --> 19:59.364
Uh, I saw you were talk to the cop
from the car accident before.

19:59.389 --> 20:00.763
- Who, Desantos?
- Yeah.

20:00.788 --> 20:02.575
Yeah. Our kids go to the same school.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.701
Uh, quick question

20:13.444 --> 20:16.409
<i>I got her leg out, but it's a mess.</i>

20:17.177 --> 20:20.081
<i>I need you to tell me how
to manage the bleeding.</i>

20:20.558 --> 20:22.971
Saleh. Saleh!

20:29.143 --> 20:30.909
I'm sorry, okay?

20:31.490 --> 20:34.114
I know, I know you have a
lot on your plate. I know.

20:35.418 --> 20:36.685
Fine.

20:38.947 --> 20:40.214
Hey.

20:40.446 --> 20:42.413
Hey. I didn't mean to interrupt.

20:42.438 --> 20:44.725
No, no. Mel called.

20:44.750 --> 20:48.234
The school's automated
attendance software misfired.

20:48.259 --> 20:49.959
Abby was there the whole time.

20:49.984 --> 20:51.696
Good to know she's okay.

20:51.721 --> 20:54.274
Mel had to cancel a meeting and
drive halfway across town,

20:54.299 --> 20:57.634
but... Anyway, Abby is fine.

20:59.246 --> 21:01.440
What's going on with you today?

21:05.523 --> 21:07.124
That, uh...

21:09.008 --> 21:11.042
That pediatric crush wound?

21:12.005 --> 21:14.240
It was a child in Syria.

21:14.354 --> 21:16.963
They found her pinned in
a bombed out building.

21:17.839 --> 21:20.640
My friend Saleh he's a volunteer
medic, only a year of med school.

21:20.665 --> 21:23.136
He calls sometimes with consults.

21:24.691 --> 21:26.058
Is she okay?

21:26.359 --> 21:28.099
We don't know yet.

21:30.409 --> 21:32.189
You told me that was hypothetical.

21:32.214 --> 21:34.128
- I didn't want to involve you.
- But you did!

21:34.153 --> 21:35.605
When you asked my advice.

21:35.763 --> 21:38.031
If I'd have known there
was a real child,

21:38.056 --> 21:39.590
I would have asked more questions.

21:39.615 --> 21:41.051
Made sure I had all the details!

21:41.076 --> 21:42.722
What if something I said
cost that child's life?

21:42.747 --> 21:45.190
I just needed guidance
on fluid resuscitation

21:45.239 --> 21:47.607
Protocols change based on the scenarios.

21:47.902 --> 21:49.602
You should know that.

21:49.631 --> 21:51.999
Are you talking about the
testing I ordered for Jasmine?

21:52.024 --> 21:53.878
I'm talking about you
being honest with me

21:53.903 --> 21:56.711
instead of taking
everything on yourself.

22:02.377 --> 22:05.045
We put in a chest tube
to drain the fluids,

22:05.151 --> 22:08.070
and we performed a surgery to
repair a torn artery in your leg.

22:08.095 --> 22:09.895
Both were successful.

22:10.113 --> 22:11.655
We'll keep you for observation

22:11.680 --> 22:14.102
but you should make a full recovery.

22:14.843 --> 22:16.891
We've called your dad.
He's on a flight now.

22:16.916 --> 22:19.107
So... - Can I see my mom?

22:25.743 --> 22:27.866
I'm so sorry.

22:39.219 --> 22:41.213
Lydia not here?

22:42.023 --> 22:43.882
She's gone to get some air.

22:44.823 --> 22:47.262
Walter, do you drive a blue sedan?

22:49.825 --> 22:51.258
Why?

22:51.859 --> 22:53.559
Because your labs came back

22:53.796 --> 22:56.061
and there was alcohol
in your bloodstream.

22:58.112 --> 23:00.607
And the bruising on your abdomen,

23:01.014 --> 23:04.141
the placement of it, it suggests
you could've hit a steering wheel.

23:07.950 --> 23:11.602
I... I started slipping.

23:12.829 --> 23:15.456
Once or twice.

23:17.385 --> 23:19.626
Then last night, with a buddy,

23:19.651 --> 23:21.251
I...

23:24.768 --> 23:27.093
I don't remember what happened.

23:29.351 --> 23:32.319
I woke up a few blocks from the house

23:32.615 --> 23:34.974
in a smashed car.

23:37.463 --> 23:41.857
Lydia wasn't home from work
yet so I left it in the lot.

23:41.882 --> 23:43.382
And just...

23:45.007 --> 23:46.975
hoped that what I hit

23:47.386 --> 23:49.823
was parked and empty.

23:52.510 --> 23:54.703
A mother and daughter
came in this morning.

23:55.713 --> 23:57.664
Hit by a blue sedan.

23:59.415 --> 24:01.650
Oh... Oh...

24:06.550 --> 24:08.301
Are they okay?

24:08.900 --> 24:10.261
No, Walter.

24:10.442 --> 24:11.762
They're not.

24:14.160 --> 24:17.269
There were no complications and
you're responding to medication well.

24:17.294 --> 24:18.686
Are you feeling better?

24:18.711 --> 24:20.354
How long do I have to stay here?

24:20.396 --> 24:21.730
A little while longer.

24:21.755 --> 24:25.433
We want to make sure that your
blood sugar is under control.

24:25.458 --> 24:27.511
And we have to show you

24:27.653 --> 24:29.871
how to use a glucose
meter before you go.

24:29.896 --> 24:33.165
It'll help you and Liz manage
things easier when you get home.

24:33.190 --> 24:34.857
That's not my home.

24:35.259 --> 24:37.162
I never wanted to go there.

24:37.366 --> 24:40.165
I know it's hard,
adjusting to a new place.

24:41.323 --> 24:43.835
Where I live isn't my home either.

24:43.860 --> 24:46.462
Do you have to share it with
someone you barely know?

24:52.209 --> 24:54.387
We'll try again later.

25:06.742 --> 25:08.310
Do you have a minute?

25:08.517 --> 25:10.236
I've got a hypothetical.

25:11.135 --> 25:12.740
Sure.

25:14.275 --> 25:16.043
If a patient

25:16.399 --> 25:18.663
admits to a crime in confidence...

25:18.688 --> 25:21.071
- Mm-hmm?
- Would you tell the authorities?

25:21.096 --> 25:23.415
We can't. We're bound by
doctor-patient confidentiality.

25:23.440 --> 25:25.793
I know, I know. Unless it's
to report a gunshot wound,

25:25.818 --> 25:27.633
the safety of a child, or
intent to cause future harm.

25:27.658 --> 25:28.925
I know. And it isn't.

25:28.950 --> 25:31.051
Then you'd be breaking your oath.

25:31.115 --> 25:32.508
Yeah, I know that too.

25:33.165 --> 25:35.171
I just... I...

25:35.503 --> 25:39.098
I can't help but think that you,
you know, the rule-breaker,

25:39.123 --> 25:41.586
Doctor Instinct, would
understand that someone might

25:41.611 --> 25:43.798
break the oath for a moral
obligation you felt

25:43.823 --> 25:45.938
outweighed the needs of a patient.

25:46.835 --> 25:49.504
There are consequences to
drawing lines like that.

25:49.529 --> 25:51.028
Then you've done it?

25:52.797 --> 25:56.033
During the war, I treated
regime soldiers.

25:56.058 --> 25:58.661
Only when they forced me.
Often, at gunpoint.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.462
It's fine.

26:04.839 --> 26:07.607
The point is, I chose sides.

26:07.873 --> 26:10.255
And now I can't go home.

26:14.803 --> 26:17.304
His nausea's getting worse.

26:18.402 --> 26:22.225
I always know something's
wrong when he gets quiet.

26:23.563 --> 26:28.481
Liddy, could you go get me
a glass of water, please?

26:29.401 --> 26:31.035
Sure.

26:38.439 --> 26:40.773
No sign of new haemorrhaging.

26:42.923 --> 26:47.829
We're just waiting to hear back from the
OR on a scheduled time for your ligation.

26:51.007 --> 26:52.703
You haven't told her?

26:56.637 --> 26:58.905
When are the cops coming for me?

26:59.763 --> 27:01.803
I haven't told them either.

27:01.828 --> 27:03.505
But I hurt those people.

27:03.530 --> 27:05.994
I have to pay for what I've done.

27:06.019 --> 27:09.209
I agree. But I have a duty to
protect your confidentiality.

27:09.234 --> 27:12.264
So if you want to tell the police,
you'll have to them yourself.

27:12.289 --> 27:14.310
What, what if, what if I...

27:14.727 --> 27:17.123
If I can't bring myself to do it?

27:17.254 --> 27:19.121
Then you'll have your
surgical procedure.

27:19.146 --> 27:20.302
Lydia will take you home.

27:20.327 --> 27:22.368
And I guess you try to live
with what you've done.

27:29.528 --> 27:32.063
The Mannitol is helping.

27:32.217 --> 27:33.797
Jasmine's going to be okay.

27:33.822 --> 27:35.424
Thank God.

27:36.276 --> 27:38.244
So, was this my fault? Is
it the food I'm making?

27:38.269 --> 27:40.264
- Was I making the wrong...
- No, type 1 is genetic.

27:40.289 --> 27:42.514
There was nothing you
could do to prevent this.

27:42.539 --> 27:44.615
But you can help her control it.

27:44.640 --> 27:47.409
I doubt she'll let me do that.

27:48.298 --> 27:51.251
I thought I was doing a good
thing, becoming a foster mom.

27:51.283 --> 27:54.152
- But this?
- I think you're very strong,

27:54.221 --> 27:55.819
doing something like this.

27:55.844 --> 27:57.878
I'm not questioning my decision.
I just...

27:58.848 --> 28:00.782
I feel like I'm messing it up.

28:02.036 --> 28:05.982
Like I'm messing her up, and she's
already been through so much already.

28:06.065 --> 28:07.373
I'm sorry.

28:09.637 --> 28:13.099
We all feel like that the
minute we become parents.

28:14.122 --> 28:17.457
But the highs outweigh the lows.

28:18.944 --> 28:20.843
And all we can do is...

28:21.280 --> 28:24.972
get up every day, committed
to doing our very best.

29:29.593 --> 29:31.994
Walter's ligation procedure.

29:32.233 --> 29:33.833
When is that happening?

29:33.858 --> 29:36.006
Well, procedures are triaged
according to urgency.

29:36.031 --> 29:38.262
And because he stopped bleeding,

29:38.287 --> 29:41.107
it may not be for a few more hours.

29:41.246 --> 29:43.814
When... When he does get it,

29:43.839 --> 29:46.441
how much time will it buy him?

29:46.927 --> 29:50.784
Well, it only fixes the
bleeding, not his liver.

29:50.809 --> 29:54.585
- Oh...
- And there are no guarantees, but...

29:55.102 --> 29:56.647
Without the transplant...

29:57.553 --> 29:59.220
maybe a year?

30:02.874 --> 30:06.663
A year more than that young woman
will have with her mother.

30:08.115 --> 30:10.037
I'm so sorry. Lydia

30:11.928 --> 30:14.686
It won't be the life we planned,

30:14.711 --> 30:16.616
- but...
- But...

30:18.614 --> 30:21.381
He did a terrible thing,

30:21.406 --> 30:24.508
but he's not a terrible person.

30:26.003 --> 30:28.639
He'll never forgive himself for this.

30:29.652 --> 30:33.733
What kind of a person would I be
if I left him alone with that?

30:45.061 --> 30:46.728
You told the cops.

30:46.906 --> 30:49.325
No, he did. And she's sticking by him.

30:49.886 --> 30:51.454
And you wouldn't?

30:51.506 --> 30:53.040
He killed somebody.

30:53.326 --> 30:56.608
I would, yes, like to say that
if I was in love with somebody,

30:56.633 --> 30:58.630
I would be able to get
past that, but I...

30:58.655 --> 31:00.351
People stay with people who
hurt them all the time.

31:00.376 --> 31:02.178
We're kind of stupid like that.

31:02.345 --> 31:04.534
Well, if that cop arrests
Walter before his procedure,

31:04.559 --> 31:07.302
there's no telling when he'll
be able to get another one.

31:12.376 --> 31:14.256
Let me see what I can do.

31:21.444 --> 31:23.412
<i>Bashir? Hello?</i>

31:23.437 --> 31:24.616
<i>Bashir?</i>

31:24.641 --> 31:26.410
<i>Alhamdulellah.</i>

31:26.435 --> 31:28.772
<i>I was on the road. The
cell towers are still...</i>

31:28.797 --> 31:30.499
Are you driving her yourself?

31:30.524 --> 31:32.994
<i>I had to. Nobody was coming for us.</i>

31:33.839 --> 31:37.752
<i>She's feverish. She started
vomiting 15 minutes ago.</i>

31:37.777 --> 31:39.398
Can you...

31:40.474 --> 31:42.210
Can you feel air under the flesh?

31:42.235 --> 31:44.338
Press down on the tissue.

31:50.181 --> 31:51.715
<i>Yes, I feel air.</i>

31:51.740 --> 31:53.889
Crepitus. Saleh, you have
to amputate the leg.

31:53.914 --> 31:56.143
<i>On the side of the road? Now?</i>

31:56.180 --> 31:58.316
<i>Alone?</i> - If you don't, she'll die.

31:58.645 --> 32:01.314
And you're not alone. I'm here.

32:04.821 --> 32:08.421
So there's a patient waiting in
Emerg on a variceal ligation.

32:08.446 --> 32:10.613
Let me guess, you want to scrub in?

32:10.638 --> 32:12.606
Yes, always. But I was
actually just checking

32:12.631 --> 32:14.202
to see if there was any wiggle room.

32:14.447 --> 32:17.039
The patient needs the ligation
before he's arrested.

32:17.489 --> 32:19.540
You mean arrested?

32:19.565 --> 32:21.626
No. Like, hauled off to jail.

32:21.651 --> 32:23.795
He's a drunk driver who
killed a woman this morning.

32:24.003 --> 32:26.371
And you want to rush him into surgery

32:26.396 --> 32:28.363
so he doesn't lose his chance to get it?

32:28.771 --> 32:31.220
I didn't take you for someone
who'd be affected by that.

32:31.245 --> 32:32.679
I'm not.

32:32.863 --> 32:36.142
You know the girl with the arterial
injury we repaired earlier?

32:36.175 --> 32:38.801
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, her mom died
because of him.

32:38.843 --> 32:42.332
He should be healthy enough to serve
whatever sentence they throw at him.

32:43.549 --> 32:44.649
Well...

32:46.009 --> 32:47.860
The candor's refreshing.

32:47.885 --> 32:49.139
Anyway, he's in luck.

32:49.164 --> 32:50.853
An elective case dropped off the board

32:50.878 --> 32:53.366
so I was about to move him
up to this evening anyway.

32:56.338 --> 32:58.162
It's the ICU. It's the daughter.

32:58.202 --> 32:59.572
Better go, then.

33:05.218 --> 33:06.819
You paged me?

33:06.844 --> 33:08.385
Patient is a nine-year-old girl.

33:08.410 --> 33:10.174
Crushed lower right extremity.

33:10.199 --> 33:12.177
Saleh called with a few questions.

33:12.385 --> 33:14.096
We really need your help.

33:15.308 --> 33:16.722
What do I need to know?

33:19.418 --> 33:21.205
This is Saleh. We worked
together in Syria.

33:21.230 --> 33:22.947
<i>Hello, doctor.</i>

33:23.173 --> 33:25.041
Severe soft tissue injury

33:25.066 --> 33:27.603
progressed by a gangrenous limb.

33:27.735 --> 33:30.320
He's pulled over on the side of
the road and needs to perform

33:30.345 --> 33:32.580
an above the knee amputation right now.

33:32.605 --> 33:34.005
With what tools?

33:34.030 --> 33:36.423
<i>I have a scalpel, scissors,</i>

33:36.448 --> 33:38.783
<i>hemo... The clips.</i>

33:38.808 --> 33:41.611
- Hemostatic clips.
<i>- Yes, dressings.</i>

33:42.095 --> 33:44.642
<i>- And a handsaw.</i>
- Ketamine for sedation.

33:44.942 --> 33:47.003
Uh, can you show me the girl again?

33:47.643 --> 33:51.046
<i>She weighs maybe 20 kilograms, Dr.
Hunter.</i>

33:51.071 --> 33:53.343
Try 20 megs, if you have that.

33:53.368 --> 33:55.554
Uh, 20 milligrams.

33:58.316 --> 33:59.516
<i>Done.</i>

33:59.541 --> 34:01.142
Okay, Saleh.

34:01.393 --> 34:03.595
If the tourniquet is tight,

34:03.620 --> 34:04.787
make your incision.

34:04.812 --> 34:07.649
Start by dividing the
skin circumferentially.

34:19.120 --> 34:21.913
Good. Now cut through the
subcutaneous tissues

34:21.938 --> 34:23.371
<i>Okay.</i>

34:24.268 --> 34:25.708
You're doing great.

34:34.076 --> 34:36.134
<i>Code Blue. Room 305</i>

34:36.159 --> 34:38.572
- You've gotta go to that, Bash.
- I can't leave him.

34:38.597 --> 34:39.830
Saleh?

34:40.121 --> 34:42.641
You think we can do
this, just you and me?

34:43.908 --> 34:45.272
Okay.

34:45.297 --> 34:47.646
Who knows, something might
get lost in translation.

34:47.670 --> 34:48.940
Bash.

34:49.101 --> 34:51.503
We got this, okay? Go.

34:51.652 --> 34:53.766
<i>- Code blue, room 305.</i>
- Thank you, Theo.

35:01.313 --> 35:03.614
<i>I finished the sewing.</i>

35:03.939 --> 35:05.947
<i>There's blood everywhere.</i>

35:05.999 --> 35:07.333
Tighten the tourniquet,

35:07.358 --> 35:10.134
then apply the hemostats to
the longitudinal structures

35:10.159 --> 35:12.506
that are likely to be the
major blood vessels.

35:12.531 --> 35:14.507
<i>Hemostats to...</i>

35:14.908 --> 35:16.440
<i>I'm sorry?</i>

35:16.465 --> 35:19.846
The structures that look like...

35:22.302 --> 35:23.808
So...

35:25.054 --> 35:26.487
The leg...

35:27.056 --> 35:29.057
The blood vessels.

35:29.082 --> 35:31.649
Okay? Yes? The structures,
the blood vessels.

35:32.694 --> 35:35.187
- What happened?
- Acute respiratory failure,

35:35.212 --> 35:37.220
we need a non-rebreather
at 15 litres per minute,

35:37.245 --> 35:39.468
- and a stat portable chest.
- Chest tube's not working.

35:39.493 --> 35:41.516
- O2 stats?
- Uh, 66.

35:41.541 --> 35:45.111
Resp is 40, tachy's at 144, BP's 84 60.

35:45.136 --> 35:48.580
Prep a new tube. If it's kinked,
we'll have to re-insert.

35:49.810 --> 35:52.175
The chest tube's definitely not working.

35:52.200 --> 35:54.088
Tension pneumothorax.

35:54.745 --> 35:56.674
Your colleagues were
all here before you.

35:56.902 --> 35:58.436
Sorry, I got held up.

35:58.461 --> 36:00.528
If you can't get here on
time, we don't need you.

36:06.434 --> 36:09.687
Insert a new tube, she'll settle.

36:10.864 --> 36:14.317
You sure? Just try again.

36:14.342 --> 36:15.777
Keep at it

36:16.761 --> 36:18.118
Show me.

36:18.306 --> 36:20.782
<i>Here. Do you see it?</i>

36:20.807 --> 36:23.118
- Good.
<i>- What do I do now?</i>

36:23.143 --> 36:25.720
Okay now, keep the tourniquet

36:25.745 --> 36:28.221
- in the position, and...
<i>- Okay.</i>

36:28.480 --> 36:32.307
Just examine for obvious blood vessels.
Then clamp with your hemostat

36:32.423 --> 36:35.088
<i>- Okay.</i>
- That was fast.

36:35.463 --> 36:36.979
She's okay.

36:37.004 --> 36:38.393
<i>Dr. Hunter, there's oozing.</i>

36:38.418 --> 36:40.585
That's normal, just keep an eye on it.

36:40.610 --> 36:43.430
If it continues, you just need
more pressure on the dressing.

36:43.645 --> 36:46.180
<i>Thank you. Thank you both.</i>

36:46.224 --> 36:48.393
Well done, Saleh.

36:50.910 --> 36:52.577
What the hell is going on in here?

36:52.602 --> 36:55.904
Uh... nine-year-old, uh...

36:56.351 --> 36:59.705
Syrian female, crushed lower extremities

36:59.730 --> 37:02.869
after a building collapse.
Rapid onset of GFM

37:02.894 --> 37:04.528
after tourniquet and rescue.

37:04.574 --> 37:06.998
A volunteer medic just
successfully performed

37:07.023 --> 37:11.374
a roadside amputation
with almost no equipment.

37:12.834 --> 37:14.201
Prognosis?

37:14.226 --> 37:15.504
Uh...

37:15.875 --> 37:18.189
She's responsive and stable.

37:18.214 --> 37:19.848
He, He saved her life.

37:19.873 --> 37:21.273
Good.

37:21.622 --> 37:23.510
Find me before you leave.

37:25.531 --> 37:27.140
<i>Who was that?</i>

37:27.165 --> 37:28.765
The big boss.

37:29.018 --> 37:31.275
Call me when you get to
the hospital, Saleh.

37:35.221 --> 37:37.108
You do that kind of thing a lot?

37:38.828 --> 37:40.762
Not anymore.

37:48.709 --> 37:51.246
Cops agreed to wait until he's out.

37:52.370 --> 37:54.571
Thank you for pushing for the ligation.

37:54.874 --> 37:56.934
Well, I didn't do it for him.

38:07.359 --> 38:08.759
Dinner.

38:10.039 --> 38:11.685
For one?

38:11.710 --> 38:13.603
I have to get back.

38:15.720 --> 38:17.690
My dad's a drinker,

38:17.715 --> 38:20.656
and one time he almost
ran the car off the road

38:20.681 --> 38:21.984
with me and my brother inside.

38:22.009 --> 38:23.862
And the next day, he...

38:23.991 --> 38:26.074
didn't even realize he'd done it.

38:27.046 --> 38:29.642
We don't talk anymore.

38:33.612 --> 38:37.044
Why are you telling me this?

38:37.069 --> 38:38.803
Because...

38:40.075 --> 38:41.643
I want you to know.

38:41.668 --> 38:42.935
And...

38:43.022 --> 38:47.679
if I'm closed off sometimes,
which I might be again,

38:49.858 --> 38:52.224
it's not because I
don't want you around.

38:53.023 --> 38:55.562
Well, you haven't driven
me away just yet.

38:59.591 --> 39:01.892
Good news. You're almost
ready to be discharged.

39:01.917 --> 39:03.318
Only one thing left.

39:03.740 --> 39:06.542
You need to be able to test
your own blood sugar levels

39:06.567 --> 39:08.062
in order to leave.

39:08.087 --> 39:09.825
Liz knows how.

39:11.743 --> 39:14.144
You know, I helped treat
a little girl today

39:14.169 --> 39:17.166
who lost her leg in an accident.

39:18.521 --> 39:20.332
Her life is going to be different,

39:20.357 --> 39:22.088
and it will be hard at first.

39:22.358 --> 39:24.673
It'll be hard forever.

39:25.066 --> 39:26.878
I think that's up to her.

39:27.440 --> 39:30.617
And I bet it won't be long before
she gets good on crutches.

39:30.642 --> 39:32.984
Maybe even learns to
play soccer with them.

39:35.248 --> 39:37.728
You said this isn't your home?

39:37.972 --> 39:39.688
My home is Syria.

39:40.615 --> 39:42.901
Do you wish you were still there?

39:44.342 --> 39:46.236
Sometimes.

39:46.776 --> 39:48.572
A lot of the time.

39:54.793 --> 39:57.164
I wish my Grandma was still here.

39:59.202 --> 40:03.439
What helps me is to focus on
the things I can control.

40:04.192 --> 40:06.674
It makes everything I can't less scary.

40:07.261 --> 40:08.979
What do you do?

40:10.372 --> 40:11.939
I do this.

40:14.106 --> 40:15.935
This child...

40:17.678 --> 40:19.779
was on the other side of the world.

40:19.804 --> 40:21.972
To be a part of saving her...

40:21.997 --> 40:24.098
<i>Puts things in perspective?</i>

40:24.123 --> 40:25.957
I'm sorry about earlier.

40:26.623 --> 40:29.952
I just was... upset that I
couldn't do anything to help.

40:29.977 --> 40:32.492
<i>I know it's hard to be the one away.</i>

40:33.485 --> 40:34.773
I just...

40:34.860 --> 40:37.415
I hate how much I'm missing.

40:37.440 --> 40:39.248
You know, the good, the bad.

40:40.938 --> 40:43.252
And I don't mean just with them.

40:44.052 --> 40:45.505
With you, too.

40:45.530 --> 40:47.285
<i>In six months, you'll be back,</i>

40:47.310 --> 40:49.759
<i>and everything will be so much better.</i>

40:49.784 --> 40:53.554
Hey, I have tomorrow off.

40:53.676 --> 40:55.377
I can fly home.

40:55.402 --> 40:57.975
Surprise the girls. Take
them out of school?

40:58.955 --> 41:02.791
<i>It's difficult when you</i>

41:02.816 --> 41:05.107
come home for such a short time.

41:05.653 --> 41:06.910
<i>When you go,</i>

41:07.548 --> 41:10.050
<i>I'm picking up the pieces.</i>

41:10.075 --> 41:13.355
I know I didn't handle
things well today.

41:13.380 --> 41:15.981
But if... If you're upset with me, or...

41:16.006 --> 41:17.828
<i>I'm not, I swear.</i>

41:18.202 --> 41:22.667
<i>I'm just trying to be
honest about what I need.</i>

41:23.155 --> 41:25.879
<i>Gotta go. I'll call you when I can.
Have a good night.</i>

41:25.904 --> 41:27.404
You too.

41:27.429 --> 41:28.941
Hey, Mel?

41:34.832 --> 41:37.551
And the timeline of this?

41:37.576 --> 41:40.436
Okay, let's follow the progress for her.

41:40.756 --> 41:42.979
Takes 24 hours, and then

41:43.230 --> 41:44.897
get back to me, let me know,

41:44.922 --> 41:47.108
how's the rest. Alright, thanks, Mark.

41:47.133 --> 41:48.834
How's the Syrian girl?

41:48.859 --> 41:50.393
They made it to the hospital.

41:50.418 --> 41:53.322
Good. Take a seat.

41:56.437 --> 41:58.705
Look, I understand what you did.

41:59.128 --> 42:00.955
It's why I hired you.

42:01.771 --> 42:03.371
But you can't ever do it again.

42:03.396 --> 42:05.931
Not from work, not with
everything we're up against.

42:05.956 --> 42:08.588
I need you to be better
than everyone else.

42:08.626 --> 42:11.673
That means when you're paged, you
arrive first, and be present.

42:11.698 --> 42:13.265
Yes, sir.

42:15.824 --> 42:18.692
I spoke to the Dean's office
at your med school today.

42:18.717 --> 42:20.121
I didn't get the transcripts.

42:20.146 --> 42:24.520
But they did assure me they exist,
and confirmed your qualification

42:26.174 --> 42:29.343
You... They did? How is that possible?

42:29.879 --> 42:31.760
I told legal I would
swear whatever they need

42:31.785 --> 42:35.239
so we can put this thing
to bed, once and for all.

42:38.869 --> 42:41.995
Bashir, you need to learn
to take yes for an answer.

42:44.626 --> 42:46.793
We're in this together now.

42:47.220 --> 42:49.379
Don't let me down.
