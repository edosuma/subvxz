00:56.200 --> 00:58.031
How do you do?

00:58.160 --> 01:01.118
It's my very pleasant duty
to welcome you here...

01:01.240 --> 01:04.117
on behalf of Walt Disney,
Leopold Stokowski...

01:04.239 --> 01:07.676
and all the other artists
and musicians whose combined talents...

01:07.800 --> 01:12.032
went into the creation of this
new form of entertainment, Fantasia.

01:14.080 --> 01:15.832
What you're going to see...

01:15.960 --> 01:18.394
are the designs
and pictures and stories...

01:18.520 --> 01:21.637
that music inspired in the minds
and imaginations...

01:21.760 --> 01:23.751
of a group of artists.

01:23.880 --> 01:25.711
In other words,
these are not going to be...

01:25.840 --> 01:28.070
the interpretations
of trained musicians.

01:28.200 --> 01:30.191
Which I think is all to the good.

01:30.320 --> 01:31.833
So now we present...

01:31.960 --> 01:35.999
the Tocatta and Fugue in D-Minor
by Johann Sebastian Bach...

01:36.120 --> 01:39.112
interpreted in pictures
by Walt Disney and his associates...

01:39.240 --> 01:41.390
and in music
by the Philadelphia Orchestra...

01:41.520 --> 01:44.910
and its conductor,
Leopold Stokowski.

11:09.640 --> 11:14.077
You know, it's funny how wrong
an artist can be about his own work.

11:14.200 --> 11:17.351
Now, the one composition of
Tchaikovsky's that he really detested...

11:17.480 --> 11:19.198
was his Nutcracker Suite...

11:19.320 --> 11:21.595
which is probably the most
popular thing he ever wrote.

11:21.720 --> 11:25.030
Incidentally, you won't see
any nutcracker on the screen.

11:25.160 --> 11:27.628
There's nothing left
of him but the title.

25:23.200 --> 25:27.034
And now we're going to hear a piece of
music that tells a very definite story.

25:27.160 --> 25:31.039
It's a very old story.
One that goes back almost 2,000 years.

25:31.160 --> 25:34.072
A legend about a sorcerer
who had an apprentice.

25:34.720 --> 25:37.632
He was a bright young lad
very anxious to learn the business.

25:37.760 --> 25:40.069
As a matter of fact,
he was a little bit too bright...

25:40.200 --> 25:43.875
uh, because he started practising
some of the boss's best magic tricks...

25:44.000 --> 25:46.070
before learning
how to control them.

34:44.920 --> 34:47.228
Mr. Stokowski.
Mr. Stokowski.

34:50.480 --> 34:52.710
My congratulations, sir.

34:53.320 --> 34:55.675
Congratulations to you, Mickey.

34:55.800 --> 34:57.552
Gee, thanks.

34:57.680 --> 35:00.956
Well, so long.
I'll be seein' ya.

35:02.120 --> 35:03.678
Bye.

35:09.240 --> 35:12.630
When Igor Stravinsky wrote his ballet,
The Rite of Spring...

35:12.760 --> 35:15.991
his purpose was, in his own words,
to ''express primitive life. ''

35:16.120 --> 35:19.874
So Walt Disney and his fellow artists
have taken him at his word.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.594
Instead of presenting the ballet
in its original form...

35:22.720 --> 35:26.872
as a simple series of tribal dances,
they have visualized it as a pageant--

35:27.000 --> 35:30.390
as the story of the growth
of life on Earth.

35:30.520 --> 35:33.557
It's a coldly accurate reproduction
of what science thinks went on...

35:33.680 --> 35:36.672
during the first few billion years
of this planet's existence.

35:36.800 --> 35:40.349
So now imagine yourselves
out in space...

35:40.480 --> 35:42.948
billions and billions
of years ago...

35:43.080 --> 35:46.277
looking down on this lonely,
tormented little planet...

35:46.400 --> 35:49.233
spinning through
an empty sea of nothingness.

58:49.040 --> 58:52.191
Uh, before we get into
the second half of the programme...

58:52.320 --> 58:54.276
I'd like to introduce
somebody to you--

58:54.400 --> 58:56.516
somebody who's
very important to Fantasia.

58:56.640 --> 58:58.596
He's very shy and very retiring.

58:58.720 --> 59:01.473
I just happened to run across him
one day at the Disney studios.

59:01.600 --> 59:03.511
But when I did, I realized...

59:03.640 --> 59:06.393
that here was not only an indispensable
member of the organization...

59:06.520 --> 59:08.272
but a screen personality.

59:08.400 --> 59:11.551
And so I'm very happy to have
this opportunity to introduce to you...

59:11.680 --> 59:12.999
the soundtrack.

59:16.840 --> 59:18.717
Come on. Don't be timid.

59:21.480 --> 59:23.118
That a soundtrack.

59:23.240 --> 59:25.834
Now, watching him, I discovered
that every beautiful sound...

59:25.960 --> 59:28.520
also creates
an equally beautiful picture.

59:28.640 --> 59:33.031
Now, look. Will the soundtrack
kindly produce a sound?

59:33.160 --> 59:36.232
Go on, don't be nervous.
Go ahead. Any sound.

59:39.760 --> 59:43.355
Well, that isn't quite
what I had in mind.

59:43.480 --> 59:46.358
Uh, suppose we see
and hear the harp.

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:09.036
Uh, now one of the strings--
say, the violin.

01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:32.555
And now--
now one of the woodwinds--

01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:34.557
a flute.

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:41.473
Very pretty.

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:44.068
Now let's have a brass instrument--
the trumpet.

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:05.230
Oh, all right. Now, uh, how about
a low instrument-- the bassoon?

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:15.951
Go on. Go on.
Drop the other shoe, will you?

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:24.790
Well, now to finish, suppose we see
some of the percussion instruments...

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:26.911
beginning with the bass drum.

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:52.837
Thanks a lot, all of ya.

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:57.392
The symphony that Beethoven
called the ''Pastoral''...

01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:00.796
his sixth, is one of the few pieces
of music he ever wrote...

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:03.115
that tells something
like a definite story.

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:05.708
He was a great nature lover,
and in this symphony...

01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:08.877
he paints a musical picture
of a day in the country.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.911
Now, of course,
the country that Beethoven described...

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:13.554
was the countryside
with which he was familiar.

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:16.433
But his music covers
a much wider field than that...

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:18.915
and so Walt Disney
has given the ''Pastoral''symphony...

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:20.917
a mythological setting.

01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:44.114
Now we're going to do one of the most
famous and popular ballets...

01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:46.470
ever written--
''The Dance of the Hours''...

01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:48.989
from Ponchielli's opera
La Gioconda.

01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:51.111
It's a pageant
of the hours of the day.

01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:53.117
All this takes place
in the great hall...

01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:54.878
with its garden beyond...

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.231
of the palace of Duke Alvise,
a Venetian nobleman.

01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:54.713
The last number
in our Fantasia programme...

01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:57.798
is a combination of two pieces
of music so utterly different...

01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:01.993
in construction and mood that
they set each other off perfectly.

01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:04.111
The first is
''A Night on Bald Mountain''...

01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:07.596
by one of Russia's greatest composers,
Modeste Mussorgsky.

01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:11.030
The second is Franz Schubert's
immortal ''Ave Maria. ''

01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:12.878
Musically and dramatically,
we have here...

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:16.117
a picture of the struggle
between the profane and the sacred.
