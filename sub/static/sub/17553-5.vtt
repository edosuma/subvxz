00:02.069 --> 00:02.068
Previously on Ninjago...

00:02.069 --> 00:03.833
Previously on Ninjago...

00:04.037 --> 00:06.734
We're friends. But that's all we are.

00:06.907 --> 00:10.241
You want the girl. I can make this happen.

00:10.410 --> 00:12.469
I guess one little wish
wouldn't hurt.

00:12.646 --> 00:13.977
We need to get that map.

00:14.147 --> 00:15.308
- It's on a lantern.
- I got it.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.418
NO! Kai!

00:21.000 --> 00:27.074

00:53.253 --> 00:56.518
Welcome to my humble abode.

00:56.757 --> 00:57.883
Wow.

00:58.125 --> 00:59.957
- Awesome.
- Wow!

01:05.197 --> 01:07.860
Fear isn't a word where <i>I</i> come from.

01:08.168 --> 01:10.694
So how did you
come across this place again?

01:10.871 --> 01:13.932
I saved up. Yeah, that's it.

01:14.107 --> 01:18.806
Uh, I saved up every little bit and now...
Ta-da! Here's my secret hideout.

01:19.713 --> 01:22.182
Of course, it can be our secret hideout.

01:22.349 --> 01:24.408
Fear isn't a word where...

01:24.585 --> 01:28.385
First we lost Wu, then Misako. Now Kai.

01:28.555 --> 01:31.616
I don't know about you,
but I'm starting to see a pattern.

01:31.792 --> 01:35.057
Whenever one of us finds ourselves alone,
we disappear.

01:35.228 --> 01:37.526
Then we better stick together
from here on out.

01:37.698 --> 01:40.724
We need to take a look at that lantern.
Jay, hit the lights.

01:40.901 --> 01:43.165
Lights. Lights.

01:44.338 --> 01:45.499
Where would they be?

01:47.541 --> 01:48.975
Aha! Found them!

01:49.142 --> 01:50.803
Sorry, big house.

01:56.149 --> 01:57.173
No!

02:03.423 --> 02:08.622
Wow. So, this is supposed to point the way
to the only thing that can stop Nadakhan?

02:08.794 --> 02:10.786
Not stop, slow.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.433
Remember, a drop of venom
from a Tiger Widow

02:13.600 --> 02:15.227
<i>can kill a normal person,</i>

02:15.402 --> 02:18.667
<i>but slow a Djinn down
before he can disappear on us.</i>

02:18.839 --> 02:21.809
<i>If we need to trap him,
we'll need this venom.</i>

02:21.975 --> 02:23.409
So let's figure out a plan.

02:23.577 --> 02:26.308
You saved up for this place? Baloney.

02:26.480 --> 02:30.110
Whenever money comes your way
you waste it on junk food and video games.

02:30.283 --> 02:31.409
What's really up?

02:31.585 --> 02:34.782
And don't think you can lie to me.
I know you too well.

02:34.955 --> 02:36.821
Fine. I made a wish with Nadakhan.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.958
You've seen Nadakhan and haven't told us!

02:39.192 --> 02:41.593
Shh! He came when I was alone.

02:41.762 --> 02:44.026
I wished to be rich and impress Nya,

02:44.197 --> 02:47.258
and instead I got a letter telling me
I've inherited my dad's estate.

02:47.434 --> 02:51.428
Only it turns out I'm adopted,
and my birth dad is Cliff Gordon!

02:51.638 --> 02:54.039
- Who?
- The guy who played Fritz Donnegan.

02:54.207 --> 02:56.505
So, the Tiger Widow
is on that island?

02:56.677 --> 02:59.647
An island that doesn't exist
according to my database.

02:59.813 --> 03:02.908
How could you be so stupid to make a wish?

03:03.083 --> 03:05.518
You know everyone else
who has faced him is now gone.

03:05.686 --> 03:08.087
It's 'cause back in the
Spinjitzu Master's Tomb,

03:08.255 --> 03:11.850
when everyone saw their future,
and I told everyone I had an eye patch...

03:12.025 --> 03:14.722
- I remember.
- Well, I saw something else.

03:14.895 --> 03:18.195
I saw the reflection
of me and Nya together.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.163
- What?
- I don't know how,

03:20.333 --> 03:22.893
but in the future
we end up with each other.

03:23.070 --> 03:26.267
Although she's made it painfully clear
I never stand a chance.

03:26.440 --> 03:29.637
So, when Nadakhan found me,
I couldn't resist.

03:29.810 --> 03:32.871
But who am I kidding?
Nothing I do would impress her.

03:33.046 --> 03:37.313
After two wasted wishes, I was barely
able to escape without making my third.

03:37.484 --> 03:38.542
You have to tell them.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.847
I can't. Then Nya will know.

03:41.021 --> 03:44.082
Please, I'm asking you, as my best friend.

03:45.125 --> 03:47.287
- But if anyone else gets hurt--
- Of course.

03:47.494 --> 03:51.863
If I'm lying, may I be struck down
right now by the First Spinjitzu--

03:52.199 --> 03:54.998
Fear isn't a word where I-

03:57.270 --> 03:59.898
Oh. It was just another quake.

04:00.073 --> 04:02.974
Boy, there's been a lot of those lately.

04:03.143 --> 04:06.078
Another piece to the puzzle gone.

04:06.246 --> 04:09.876
<i>Ninjago is stumped yet again
as another chunk goes missing.</i>

04:10.050 --> 04:13.486
<i>This time from none
other than Ninjago City.</i>

04:13.887 --> 04:17.255
Sensei said he was worried
Ninjago would fall apart without him.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.449
We need to get to that island now.

04:19.625 --> 04:22.857
Go, see if you can find out
what Nadakhan is up to.

04:34.841 --> 04:38.471
You have prepared our crew well.

04:38.745 --> 04:41.305
They are much improved.

04:41.815 --> 04:45.445
And look at me, Cap'n.
I'm no longer airsick.

04:45.819 --> 04:47.344
Oops.

04:47.754 --> 04:49.222
Spoke too soon.

04:52.092 --> 04:53.958
I've been biting my tongue, Cap'n.

04:54.127 --> 04:57.529
But when we attacked the city,
I saw the girl Ninja.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.357
She looked like Delara.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.763
Really? I hadn't noticed.

05:01.935 --> 05:06.270
I'll believe that when I believe
a pirate be born to tell the truth.

05:06.439 --> 05:07.770
You should have told me.

05:07.941 --> 05:11.502
First you don't tell me your plan.
Now you keep this.

05:11.678 --> 05:16.582
We sacrificed a lot to follow you,
but trust is a wind that blows both ways.

05:18.118 --> 05:21.918
Which is why I am showing you this.

05:31.798 --> 05:35.325
Look at that. We got their ship!

05:35.502 --> 05:39.268
That we do, Clancee!
That we do!

05:40.340 --> 05:43.310
I know it doesn't look like much now.

05:43.476 --> 05:47.913
But this place will soon become Djinjago.

05:48.381 --> 05:52.443
With each Ninja my Djinn Blade consumes,

05:53.153 --> 05:57.556
more power I'm beholden
to resurrect my home world.

05:57.924 --> 06:01.656
This is what you sacrificed for.
Not some girl.

06:02.495 --> 06:04.520
For a home.

06:04.698 --> 06:08.191
I cannot do this alone, Flintlocke.
I need you.

06:08.768 --> 06:10.361
I need our crew.

06:10.637 --> 06:14.767
Together, we can make this place ours.

06:14.941 --> 06:16.340
To Nadakhan!

06:16.509 --> 06:20.412
Nadakhan! Nadakhan! Nadakhan!

06:20.580 --> 06:23.550
We have some world building to do,

06:23.717 --> 06:28.086
and I have some Ninja to find.

06:30.190 --> 06:32.784
I still don't understand
why we don't take our dragons.

06:32.959 --> 06:36.827
Judging from the map, we won't have
enough energy to sustain the distance.

06:39.966 --> 06:41.297
We'd like to charter a ship.

06:41.635 --> 06:44.366
One eye may be glass,

06:44.537 --> 06:47.871
but me other eye sees clear as a bell.

06:48.308 --> 06:53.678
A wicked storm's a-brewing
and there ain't no ships to chart.

06:55.448 --> 06:58.941
Oh, you're talking to me.
Well then, let's find another dock.

07:00.186 --> 07:02.712
Hmm. All the others will
be saying the same.

07:03.089 --> 07:05.456
Unless you own one of these beauts,

07:05.625 --> 07:09.789
the only way you're sailing out
is on a wish and a prayer.

07:10.030 --> 07:13.261
A wish and a prayer you say. Hmm.

07:13.934 --> 07:17.393
That wouldn't happen to be
Cliff Gordon's boat, now would it?

07:17.971 --> 07:21.373
Why, yes. Yes, it is.

07:21.541 --> 07:22.940
Why do you ask?

07:28.581 --> 07:31.243
Ready about. Slacken a line!

07:31.418 --> 07:32.886
<i>Now pay it out!</i>

07:33.053 --> 07:35.579
<i>That's well! Belay! Belay!</i>

07:35.755 --> 07:39.487
Full steam ahead!
Let's use the wind while it's at our back.

08:03.950 --> 08:05.714
Ah...

08:05.986 --> 08:08.580
The metal man's bird.

08:09.422 --> 08:12.949
Take it apart until it talks.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.967
Here, you'll need this.

08:21.634 --> 08:23.102
Why do I need a canteen?

08:23.269 --> 08:25.533
There may be no fresh water on the island.

08:25.705 --> 08:27.639
This way, we won't be without.

08:27.807 --> 08:32.176
But I am a Nindroid.
I repeat, why do I need a canteen?

08:32.812 --> 08:36.578
<i>Chapter Two</i> of
<i>Cliff Gordon's Guide to Wooing Women.</i>

08:36.750 --> 08:39.811
"Don't tell them the truth.
Tell them what they want to hear."

08:39.986 --> 08:41.010
Whatcha reading?

08:41.254 --> 08:42.585
Oh! Uh...

08:42.789 --> 08:45.815
This? It's a book about...

08:45.992 --> 08:48.984
Understanding the power
of your feminine side.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.493
It's a real page turner.

08:50.797 --> 08:51.821
Really?

08:52.032 --> 08:53.625
Uh... Yeah, it's fascinating.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.734
It's really given me
a new appreciation for--

08:55.902 --> 08:56.892
Oh, no!

08:57.070 --> 08:58.902
What? Did I say something wrong?

08:59.072 --> 09:01.439
Storm! Off the starboard bow!

09:04.911 --> 09:08.541
That's not just any storm.
That's an electrical storm!

09:08.715 --> 09:10.979
Get ready, Jay, we're gonna need you.

09:11.151 --> 09:12.619
Need me?

09:14.521 --> 09:16.615
This isn't what I had in mind!

09:17.991 --> 09:19.652
You have to act as our lightning rod

09:19.826 --> 09:22.193
or else the storm
will tear our ship apart!

09:26.733 --> 09:29.259
It's 'cause we have a Nindroid aboard!

09:29.869 --> 09:32.270
Zane, you have to go below deck!

09:32.439 --> 09:35.841
Zane's gonna be alone!
We all need to stay together!

09:49.923 --> 09:50.913
Huh?

09:53.927 --> 09:55.486
Your move.

09:55.662 --> 09:56.857
MY move?

09:57.030 --> 10:00.523
Yes. Surprised to see me?

10:00.700 --> 10:02.031
On the contrary.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.967
After analyzing Jay's reluctance
for me to be alone,

10:05.138 --> 10:08.631
the only logical explanation
would be his fear of your arrival,

10:08.808 --> 10:11.971
signaling to me
that you have visited him before.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.772
Since Jay is still here,

10:13.947 --> 10:17.383
it's understandable that he has not yet
completed all of his wishes.

10:17.584 --> 10:22.044
And I sense it is the last wish that
has trapped the others into your sword.

10:22.489 --> 10:25.254
So, you are the smart one.

10:25.592 --> 10:30.052
Then I take it
you do not want to make a wish?

10:30.363 --> 10:33.389
<i>Be careful, Zane. It is foolish
to believe you can outsmart him.</i>

10:33.733 --> 10:35.258
Not now, P.l.X.A.L.!

10:35.668 --> 10:37.659
I do want my three wishes.

10:37.971 --> 10:43.273
But on my third wish, it will not
be I who will disappear, but you.

10:44.777 --> 10:47.678
With Zane gone, the lightning's subsided!

10:47.847 --> 10:49.315
But now there's that!

10:51.651 --> 10:55.178
Well, what are you waiting for?

10:55.355 --> 10:57.619
Make your first wish.

10:58.625 --> 11:02.562
For my first wish,
I wish that you'll not twist my words,

11:02.729 --> 11:04.026
nor find a loophole,

11:04.464 --> 11:07.695
but understand the true intentions
of the words that I speak

11:07.867 --> 11:11.064
and carry out their will
as I've thoroughly instructed.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.800
Very well. I understand you perfectly

11:15.308 --> 11:18.141
and shall take you at your word.

11:18.311 --> 11:20.336
Your second wish?

11:20.513 --> 11:23.244
It is imperative that from here on out,

11:23.416 --> 11:27.512
whatever harm may befall me
will be done unto you ten-fold.

11:28.388 --> 11:33.485
I've not heard that one before. Very good.

11:35.061 --> 11:36.256
Port side!

11:40.400 --> 11:41.663
Now for my third wish.

11:41.834 --> 11:47.705
But for clarification, you said,
whatever harm may befall you.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.171
What do you mean?

11:49.342 --> 11:54.473
What if said harm were done
to, say, someone else?

11:54.647 --> 11:56.206
Now you are twisting my words!

11:56.382 --> 12:00.046
No, I am absolutely certain.
I heard you perfectly.

12:00.553 --> 12:03.921
No harm shall befall you.

12:04.824 --> 12:06.883
<i>I warned you not to do this, Zane.</i>

12:07.126 --> 12:09.185
<i>GASPS}
- You must not make another wish.</i>

12:09.362 --> 12:14.994
By that definition, I could simply delete
bits of information from your hard drive.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.158
<i>P.I.X.A.L. ?</i>

12:16.336 --> 12:19.966
There's no harm in that now, is there?

12:20.240 --> 12:23.608
My third wish. My third wish.

12:24.077 --> 12:27.911
Yes. Your all-important third wish.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.674
<i>Make it count.</i>

12:30.483 --> 12:34.044
But know, no matter what happens to me,

12:34.654 --> 12:39.854
the sweet little voice inside your head
will be all but gone.

12:40.793 --> 12:42.022
Erased.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.924
Checkmate.

12:44.197 --> 12:46.859
<i>I</i> wish...

12:47.033 --> 12:48.467
I wish for it all to go away!

12:51.704 --> 12:53.604
Brace yourself!

13:07.020 --> 13:08.146
Where's Zane?

13:10.556 --> 13:12.752
Maybe he's lost at sea.

13:17.897 --> 13:19.922
Nindroids don't get lost.

13:20.533 --> 13:21.898
It was Nadakhan.

13:22.068 --> 13:25.561
But don't ask me howl know. Ask Jay!

13:25.738 --> 13:27.263
What is he talking about, Jay?

13:28.207 --> 13:30.733
<i>"Chapter Two.
Don't tell them the truth.</i>

13:30.943 --> 13:32.570
<i>“Tell them what they want to hear.“</i>

13:32.745 --> 13:34.577
Look, there's Zane!

13:34.781 --> 13:36.044
What?

13:36.215 --> 13:38.445
- Huh? Where?
- There! There!

13:38.618 --> 13:41.485
The only thing I can see
is your stupid hand, Jay.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.782
No, no, look! He's there!

13:43.956 --> 13:47.187
Enough is enough.
Jay has already been alone with Nadakhan.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.795
The mansion, the boat, he wished for them.

13:49.962 --> 13:51.930
You swore you wouldn't say anything.

13:52.098 --> 13:56.262
The reason he's here and the others aren't
is because Jay never made his third wish.

13:56.436 --> 13:59.736
And if Zane knew that,
maybe he'd still be here.

13:59.906 --> 14:01.237
Why didn't you tell us?

14:01.708 --> 14:04.040
I'm sorry. ljust couldn't.

14:04.210 --> 14:07.407
It's 'cause when he saw his future,
you were with him.

14:07.580 --> 14:09.947
You told me we were never going to happen.

14:10.116 --> 14:13.814
I thought maybe these wishes were the
very thing that would bring us together.

14:13.986 --> 14:15.181
I had to try.

14:15.355 --> 14:20.088
Well, I know who just nominated themselves
to extract the Tiger widow's venom.

14:21.994 --> 14:26.397
In my defense, I did just find out
my parents are not my birth parents!

14:27.333 --> 14:29.392
Nothing? Really?

14:51.624 --> 14:55.618
I see Djinjago is coming together.

14:56.195 --> 14:59.722
We're acquiring so much land,
I wish we had more hands.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.869
I can tell you're getting stronger, Cap'n.

15:03.035 --> 15:04.935
Which one did you take?

15:05.671 --> 15:07.969
The titanium one.

15:08.141 --> 15:12.408
He put up a good fight, for a Ninja.

15:15.248 --> 15:18.775
But we mustn't become complacent.

15:18.951 --> 15:21.579
They are en route to Tiger Widow Island.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.654
Soto must have helped them.

15:23.823 --> 15:25.552
Do you want me to come with you
to stop them?

15:25.725 --> 15:27.659
No, you stay here.

15:28.227 --> 15:31.595
But I may need a lady's touch.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.459
As you wish.

15:35.735 --> 15:38.397
The Tiger widow's den
should be just up ahead.

15:38.571 --> 15:39.561
Watch your step.

15:40.173 --> 15:42.870
You don't have to tell me twice.

15:43.876 --> 15:46.846
Just how am I supposed to extract
this dangerous venom?

15:47.013 --> 15:48.105
Can I ask it nicely?

15:48.281 --> 15:50.613
Well, maybe if Zane hadn't been captured,

15:50.783 --> 15:53.218
we would have a Nindroid
around to tell you.

15:53.386 --> 15:55.184
Ooh. That's a low blow.

15:55.354 --> 15:58.380
I mean, do we know anything
about this Tiger Widow?

15:58.558 --> 16:02.222
Other than it was named
to strike terror in the hearts of men?

16:02.395 --> 16:04.864
Zane told me it's the last of its species.

16:05.031 --> 16:07.466
So it sounds like
you've only got one chance at this.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.260
But I'm sure you'll be just fine--

16:09.435 --> 16:11.096
What are you doing now?

16:11.270 --> 16:12.760
Resting my feet on this hammock.

16:12.939 --> 16:14.373
We've been walking for miles.

16:14.540 --> 16:17.976
If I have to face this thing alone,
I'm gonna need to be well rested.

16:18.144 --> 16:20.943
Jay, I don't think that's a hammock.

16:26.986 --> 16:30.354
Get it off of me! Ah! Get it off of me!
Get it off of me!

16:32.325 --> 16:34.054
We have to keep moving.

16:34.260 --> 16:36.922
Haven't I suffered enough?

16:37.096 --> 16:38.154
No!

16:41.100 --> 16:43.569
There it is. The nest.

16:45.071 --> 16:46.766
Well then, what are you waiting for?

16:46.939 --> 16:50.534
Well, I'm sorry if I'm not
jumping down there right this instant.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.109
Do you see what I'm seeing?

16:52.278 --> 16:56.738
Of course not. 'Cause all I see
is my life flashing before me!

16:57.250 --> 16:58.547
Now are you ready?

16:58.718 --> 17:00.584
Whatever happened to sticking together?

17:00.753 --> 17:03.120
What if Nadakhan persuades me
to say my final wish?

17:03.289 --> 17:06.884
Any number of bad things could
easily happen to me alone down there!

17:09.127 --> 17:11.825
I have no friends.

17:13.532 --> 17:16.002
<i>COLE". Use your canteen
to collect the venom!</i>

17:16.167 --> 17:19.798
Thank you, Mr. Helpful, but I got this.

17:24.743 --> 17:26.906
Here, Tiger Widow.

17:27.079 --> 17:30.276
I've come to ask nicely for your venom.

17:30.449 --> 17:31.746
I like tigers.

17:31.918 --> 17:36.219
Are you a little tiger?
Orjust a big scaredy-cat?

17:40.560 --> 17:41.959
It's so big!

17:47.233 --> 17:51.534
<i>How do I get venom when his fangs
only come out when he tries to bite me?</i>

17:51.704 --> 17:53.536
Then let him bite you!

17:53.706 --> 17:56.505
<i>If I get out of here,
I'm gonna bite you!</i>

17:58.611 --> 18:00.773
- Sky Pirates.
- Take cover!

18:04.483 --> 18:07.748
Finally, we're alone.

18:14.293 --> 18:16.887
Delara was filled with fire, too.

18:17.697 --> 18:22.032
When this is all over, you will be mine.

18:22.201 --> 18:24.135
Not fire, four arms.

18:24.303 --> 18:28.365
Don't ever forget.
I'm a tall glass of water.

18:30.443 --> 18:33.743
Whoa!

18:38.718 --> 18:42.245
Oh! Disgusting! This is not okay!

18:49.328 --> 18:50.762
I see the fangs!

18:50.930 --> 18:53.729
<i>Then hurry up and get the venom!</i>

18:54.333 --> 18:55.823
Oh, sorry for the delay.

18:56.002 --> 19:00.064
I've never had to milk the fangs
of a giant spider before!

19:03.843 --> 19:05.834
You don't like that, do you?

19:23.996 --> 19:27.933
Cute haircut. But you could use a trim!

19:29.935 --> 19:31.960
Why is it some girls never get along?

19:32.138 --> 19:34.436
Can't we break that stereotype?

19:44.450 --> 19:46.350
You freed me?

19:46.519 --> 19:49.454
We fight like girls, not like cheaters.

19:49.622 --> 19:52.023
Let's see what else you've got.

20:07.907 --> 20:09.238
<i>I</i> got him!

20:09.875 --> 20:11.673
I actually landed one on him!

20:14.647 --> 20:17.582
I got it! I actually got it!

20:17.750 --> 20:19.149
Get the venom!

20:19.318 --> 20:21.013
Until next time.

20:21.187 --> 20:23.519
Next time I won't play so nice.

20:23.789 --> 20:26.656
Then it's a playdate.

20:30.763 --> 20:31.753
Uh...

20:33.632 --> 20:35.532
Protect Jay!

20:38.104 --> 20:39.697
That's one big spider.

20:39.872 --> 20:40.862
Hurry!

20:42.742 --> 20:43.732
Run, you <i>guys!</i>

20:50.583 --> 20:52.347
The bridge isn't strong enough.

20:52.618 --> 20:54.712
Hold on!

20:57.022 --> 20:58.251
Gotcha!

21:00.059 --> 21:01.754
Haven't I suffered enough?

21:02.928 --> 21:05.590
- Getting closer.
- Oh, you don't say!

21:08.067 --> 21:12.368
You are certainly in a precious position.

21:12.538 --> 21:18.136
Time is running out,
but you have one wish left.

21:18.410 --> 21:21.141
- You can wish it all--
- Blah, blah, blah.

21:21.380 --> 21:24.543
You think I'm thick enough
to fall for that trick? No way!

21:24.717 --> 21:27.948
I'd rather be eaten by a spider
than listen to your beguiling voice!

21:28.120 --> 21:30.214
Then have it your way.

21:30.790 --> 21:33.020
- No! No!
- Jay!

21:38.230 --> 21:43.669
Now, say goodbye to the only thing
that can stop me.

21:43.836 --> 21:48.569
- No! No, no, no! Oh...
- And say goodbye to your friends!

21:59.585 --> 22:02.350
I'll be back for the rest of you.

22:02.822 --> 22:05.689
And since you can't get off the island,

22:06.425 --> 22:10.953
I'll know exactly where to find you.

22:17.670 --> 22:18.831
Should we fly after him?

22:19.004 --> 22:20.802
No. Save your strength.

22:20.973 --> 22:25.570
But he has Jay, and he just got rid of
the only thing that can stop him.

22:25.744 --> 22:27.508
- No, he didn't.
- Huh?

22:28.013 --> 22:29.640
He emptied the wrong canteen.

22:29.815 --> 22:33.547
- You mean--
- We have the only thing that can stop him.

22:33.719 --> 22:37.087
And better yet,
they don't know we have it.

22:37.656 --> 22:41.820
Jay's suffered enough.
It's time they do the suffering.
