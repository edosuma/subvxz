JESSE: We're with a man who thinks selling small boys on the internet is OK.

We need anyone who might have seen him, or anything, to come forward.

00:11.280 --> 00:13.040
- NEWSREADER:
- A violent and chilling end

00:13.040 --> 00:15.720
for two young Australian surfers caught in the crossfire.

00:15.720 --> 00:18.120
Marcus Kombian - local law enforcement confirms

00:18.120 --> 00:19.960
he was shot and killed during the attack,

00:19.960 --> 00:21.520
and was a close associate of one

00:21.520 --> 00:25.680
of the current leaders of the separatist movement, Remsey Gangi.

00:25.680 --> 00:28.080
They're not empty threats, Remsey. You should leave.

00:28.080 --> 00:30.800
Let's get to Cairns and we can decide what to do from there.

00:30.800 --> 00:32.400
Something's not right.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.440
What if he's not who they say he is?

00:34.440 --> 00:35.960
- ROTH:
- What do they say I am?

00:38.120 --> 00:39.760
You're a journalist, right?

00:39.760 --> 00:42.240
If I could hassle somebody else, I would.

00:42.240 --> 00:45.920
It's my fault. I set the serpent free in the garden.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.800
What are you gonna do?

00:47.800 --> 00:51.160
I'm gonna make things right. Yeah, Gary, I'm coming in to Cairns.

He's not a good swimmer.

CLEARS THROAT

02:54.920 --> 02:59.480
We have applied for a visa to attend a conference in Canberra.

02:59.480 --> 03:00.960
But I was attacked

03:00.960 --> 03:03.560
and it was no longer safe to stay in West Papua.

03:03.560 --> 03:06.200

03:22.120 --> 03:23.400
What is it?

03:23.400 --> 03:25.480
There's an outstanding warrant here.

03:25.480 --> 03:27.640
A warrant? For what?

03:27.640 --> 03:31.640
Yeah, I'm just gonna need some help up here with some IMAs.

03:31.640 --> 03:33.120
A warrant for what?

03:33.120 --> 03:34.800
See, I knew they would do this.

03:34.800 --> 03:36.360
He's the one that they're shooting at!

04:14.640 --> 04:17.600
The police called. I know what's going on.

04:17.600 --> 04:20.920
Really? Maybe you could tell me, cos I haven't got a clue.

04:23.280 --> 04:24.400
Uh...

04:25.920 --> 04:27.720
Your son is lost at sea.

04:27.720 --> 04:30.720
You think getting shit-faced is going to help in the rescue efforts?

04:30.720 --> 04:34.200
Well, no, but I'm not altogether convinced it'll hinder them, either.

04:37.280 --> 04:38.920
I just thought I'd wait here.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.720
A worry shared is a worry halved, and all that.

04:42.720 --> 04:44.720
There gonna be a lot of homilies?

04:44.720 --> 04:46.000
Who can tell?

04:46.000 --> 04:48.640
You, I'd have thought.

04:48.640 --> 04:51.920
Right, well... I'll keep 'em down to a bare minimum.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.280
So, help myself to a glass then, shall I?

05:26.400 --> 05:27.600
Oh!

05:30.160 --> 05:32.280
BOTH GROAN AND GASP

05:38.040 --> 05:39.640
HE COUGHS

05:54.200 --> 05:55.760
Argh!

05:57.440 --> 05:59.440
So...so cold!

06:03.000 --> 06:05.320
Not much chance of lighting a fire.

06:06.560 --> 06:10.280
The best I can offer you in terms of warmth is a man hug.

06:11.920 --> 06:14.360
- I don't hug men I'm not related to.
- No?

06:15.480 --> 06:17.640
No, the only man I ever hug is Ned,

06:17.640 --> 06:20.480
and that's usually at his instigation.

06:20.480 --> 06:22.280
HE CHUCKLES

06:22.280 --> 06:24.000
GROANING

06:26.000 --> 06:27.680
- I suppose...
- HE GROANS

06:37.520 --> 06:39.560
Should get the water out.

06:40.920 --> 06:42.520
What about your father?

06:44.440 --> 06:46.200
He was not a hugger.

06:48.320 --> 06:51.000
There's a lot of teeth out there.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.480
We should rest here.

06:56.320 --> 06:57.880
HE GRUNTS

06:59.160 --> 07:01.600
I don't understand why we can't just tell them

07:01.600 --> 07:04.280
you had nothing to do with Callum going missing.

07:04.280 --> 07:09.120
That's a very simplistic view on a complicated problem.

07:09.120 --> 07:11.120
Why don't we get some rest

07:11.120 --> 07:14.800
and when we wake up, we can go look for Gary?

07:17.880 --> 07:20.840
You seem to be making a habit of saving me.

07:22.200 --> 07:23.880
Don't worry about it.

07:25.360 --> 07:26.760
I'll add it to your bill.

07:35.840 --> 07:38.280
We put a hold on his visa application

07:38.280 --> 07:40.600
as soon as we heard there were links to the Mine Road attack.

07:40.600 --> 07:43.520
But he's claiming he's subject to renewed death threats.

07:43.520 --> 07:45.240
Now, we grant asylum to the leader

07:45.240 --> 07:47.720
of one of Indonesia's designated terrorist groups,

07:47.720 --> 07:49.080
they're gonna pop an artery.

07:49.080 --> 07:51.400
- One man's terrorist...
- Is another man's freedom fighter.

07:51.400 --> 07:54.080
I'm not sure that's a definition war we want to get into the middle of.

07:54.080 --> 07:55.720
What happens if we send them back?

07:55.720 --> 07:58.080
Well, you don't have to go there, given the current appetite

07:58.080 --> 08:00.320
for erring on the side of keeping Australia safe.

08:00.320 --> 08:02.920
I'm not asking what happens to us, I'm asking what happens to him.

08:02.920 --> 08:04.560
Well, if his claims are deemed to be true,

08:04.560 --> 08:06.560
he'll be sent to a refugee camp in Papua New Guinea.

08:06.560 --> 08:07.840
How safe will be here there?

08:07.840 --> 08:09.800
Oh, give me a second to rustle up my crystal ball.

08:09.800 --> 08:12.360
Great, and once you've done that, can you get me some proper intel

08:12.360 --> 08:14.360
on what kind of protections can be afforded to him

08:14.360 --> 08:16.000
if we do send him back.

We'll sort this out when I get back.

You need a drink, mate. Just...

08:29.040 --> 08:30.520
Take it.

REPORTER: Still no news in the case

08:51.320 --> 08:53.680
of missing Canberra teenager Callum McCray.

08:53.680 --> 08:56.400
A heart-breaking wait for his family continues

08:56.400 --> 09:00.360
as fears mount that he has fallen victim to an online predator.

09:00.360 --> 09:03.120
Dozens of police from the Computer Crime Squad

09:03.120 --> 09:06.680
are working round the clock, hoping for a break in the case.

09:06.680 --> 09:10.000
Callum was last seen on Friday afternoon.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.360
He was wearing grey jeans and a blue jumper

09:12.360 --> 09:15.480
and police urge anyone with information to come forward...

09:15.480 --> 09:19.760
Hm! That should be reclassified as a poison.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.360
HE CHUCKLES

09:25.080 --> 09:26.960
Where's my phone?

09:26.960 --> 09:28.480
- Hmm?
- Shit.

09:30.360 --> 09:33.240
- Has...has anyone called?
- No, no, it's OK. I called.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.360
There's no news, Ned. No news.

09:35.360 --> 09:37.600
This is exactly what's not meant to happen.

09:37.600 --> 09:39.160
- Neddy, Neddy.
- What if...?

09:39.160 --> 09:43.560
Neddy, mate, just... Why don't you get off your own case?

09:45.280 --> 09:48.240
Here you are. Watch out, it's hot. It's hot.

09:51.440 --> 09:54.080
Maybe you let go because you could.

09:54.080 --> 09:57.120
There was finally someone else around to give a toss.

09:58.280 --> 09:59.960
Because I do.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.040
I read your letters.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.960
The ones you wrote to Mum.

10:08.120 --> 10:09.960
Why did you do that?

10:13.360 --> 10:14.520
Cos she asked me to.

10:16.640 --> 10:18.400
Anyway, look, I've gotta go.

10:18.400 --> 10:21.440
Just call me if you hear anything, all right?

10:21.440 --> 10:23.600
And have a think about that offer.

10:23.600 --> 10:24.640
Eh?

10:26.160 --> 10:28.560
Half the proceeds from the sale of the house.

10:28.560 --> 10:29.840
It's yours and Jesse's.

10:29.840 --> 10:32.520
That is if you can accept it from an arsehole like me.

10:47.600 --> 10:50.880
So, do you think she's the one? Hani?

10:50.880 --> 10:53.120
I think so.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.640
But she's also the only one,

10:54.640 --> 10:57.400
so I don't really have anything else to compare her with.

10:59.120 --> 11:02.760
That said, I'm fairly sure she's the most beautiful person on the earth.

11:02.760 --> 11:05.760
Well, I'm afraid that spot's already taken by my wife.

11:05.760 --> 11:07.400
HE CHUCKLES

11:07.400 --> 11:09.400
Halle-fuckin'-lujah!

GRUNTING

11:13.680 --> 11:16.360
At least now we've got a chance of hitching a ride.

11:23.080 --> 11:26.800
I'm just wondering, am I officially your captive?

11:26.800 --> 11:29.280
Do we have to get all definitive about it at this point?

11:29.280 --> 11:31.160
I just thought if we do get a lift,

11:31.160 --> 11:32.760
you might be worried I'd tell the driver

11:32.760 --> 11:34.240
you're holding me against my will.

11:36.840 --> 11:38.640
That's a fair point.

11:38.640 --> 11:41.520
You are busting your nuts to get back to your girlfriend,

11:41.520 --> 11:44.200
but I think you're still invested in getting the boy back.

11:44.200 --> 11:47.840
In order to do that, you've gotta stay on the train a few more stops.

11:50.080 --> 11:52.320
I do all the talking. You?

11:52.320 --> 11:54.240
Not a fuckin' peep.

12:21.840 --> 12:23.400
- GARY ON RECORDING:

12:23.400 --> 12:25.280

12:25.280 --> 12:27.800
Oh! Come on, Gary. Hang up the fuckin' phone.

12:33.880 --> 12:36.600
Brother or lover - which one do you choose?

12:36.600 --> 12:39.400
Well, that's an impossible choice. They fulfil very different roles.

12:39.400 --> 12:42.520
Well, life is full of impossible choices, Jesse.

12:44.600 --> 12:47.720
You've got 30 seconds to call one of them.

12:47.720 --> 12:49.080
Which one will it be?

Jesse, thank God, thank God. Are you...are you OK?

13:03.880 --> 13:06.720
I'm OK. I'm fine. Have you heard from Hani?

13:07.680 --> 13:09.640
- VEHICLE APPROACHES
- Jesse...

13:11.320 --> 13:13.600
Oh, my God! Oh, thank God, oh, thank God.

13:13.600 --> 13:16.360
Jesse, Jesse, can you hold on for a second? Just a second.

13:17.960 --> 13:21.480
Oh, my God, oh, my God! Oh, my baby! Oh, thank God!

13:22.720 --> 13:25.280
It's OK. It's OK, Mum. It's OK.

13:25.280 --> 13:27.240
Go inside. Jesse is on the phone.

13:28.360 --> 13:31.320
Thank you. I can't ... thank you. She... No, she's fine.

13:31.320 --> 13:33.600
Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.040
Jesse?

13:36.160 --> 13:39.440
- Hey.
- Oh! My God. Are you OK?

13:40.640 --> 13:43.560
I just kept seeing you go under and I thought you were...

13:43.560 --> 13:46.760
I don't know what I'd do if something happened to you!

13:46.760 --> 13:48.560
SHE SOBS

13:50.720 --> 13:53.280
I think she's glad to hear from me.

13:55.400 --> 13:58.880
Um, Hani, will you call Ned and tell him I'm all right?

13:58.880 --> 14:02.120
Yeah, I will, I will. Where are you? Are you still with Roth?

14:02.120 --> 14:04.040
I am. He's right here. We are...

14:08.200 --> 14:10.240
SHE SIGHS

14:10.240 --> 14:12.880
It's OK. He's...he's OK.

14:12.880 --> 14:14.800
It's OK. He's fine.

14:24.600 --> 14:26.320
- GARY:
- Hello?
- Gary!

14:26.320 --> 14:28.480
I was beginning to think you'd bailed.

14:28.480 --> 14:30.840
- No, man.
- Hire a car, will ya?

14:30.840 --> 14:33.160
We're at the Miyala Railway Crossing.

14:33.160 --> 14:34.920
Come pick us up.

14:34.920 --> 14:36.720
OK, sure.

14:36.720 --> 14:38.320
Thanks.

14:56.600 --> 14:58.760
What... What are we doing?

14:58.760 --> 15:00.440
This is where I grew up.

15:01.640 --> 15:07.320
I sold the farm after my family died, but...I kept the shed.

15:07.320 --> 15:10.320
It's good to have a bolt-hole if you're in a tight space.

15:12.240 --> 15:14.200
So, Gary?

15:14.200 --> 15:15.880
- Yo.
- Anything new?

15:15.880 --> 15:19.320
- Anything of note?
- Um, nah, not that I can think of.

15:19.320 --> 15:22.040
Had a bit of a snarl-up with some deliveries in Germany

15:22.040 --> 15:24.240
but...got it sorted.

15:24.240 --> 15:26.320
What would I do without ya, huh?

15:31.400 --> 15:33.880
So, uh, really?

15:33.880 --> 15:35.120
Nothing new?

15:37.040 --> 15:39.080
Nope.

15:39.080 --> 15:40.800
Cos, um...

15:40.800 --> 15:44.360
Jesse and I were doing a bit of housekeeping on the site and, um...

15:47.080 --> 15:49.960
..things are not exactly as I remember them.

15:49.960 --> 15:52.920
Yeah, um, I...I did make a few changes

15:52.920 --> 15:54.640
to the way the system admin runs,

15:54.640 --> 15:56.560
but nothing major.

15:56.560 --> 15:58.280
Right?

15:59.320 --> 16:03.080
"Major" is a relative concept.

16:03.080 --> 16:05.680
Why don't I get your laptop and we'll check it?

16:11.200 --> 16:13.760
Yo, what's he talking about, housekeeping?

16:15.320 --> 16:17.120
- Hello!
- CLICKS FINGERS

16:17.120 --> 16:18.400
Talking to you!

16:18.400 --> 16:20.160
What have you been doing with the site?

16:21.880 --> 16:23.560
What the fuck is wrong with you?!

16:26.560 --> 16:27.880
You two getting along?

16:29.720 --> 16:31.160
Um...

16:32.360 --> 16:37.040
Gary, why don't you, uh...

16:37.040 --> 16:39.720
- take a seat?
- No, I'm right, thanks.
- No, I'd...

16:39.720 --> 16:41.400
I'd really like you to sit.

16:44.320 --> 16:45.920
TAPS CHAIR

16:47.720 --> 16:48.760
Sure.

16:50.840 --> 16:51.880
Jess?

16:53.600 --> 16:55.720
Would you mind walking us through it?

16:57.560 --> 16:59.640
Can... Can I...?

16:59.640 --> 17:00.680
Can I...?

17:06.400 --> 17:10.880
I'm not... I'm really... I'm much better when I can...plan for things,

17:10.880 --> 17:13.920
and, um, I'm...I'm not sure what's going to happen here and I...

17:15.240 --> 17:18.760
It feels like something...bad is gonna happen.

17:18.760 --> 17:21.280
Something bad is already happening, Jesse.

17:21.280 --> 17:24.000
Something bad is happening to a kid who doesn't deserve it.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.480
- Hey, Jan...
- I think I asked you to sit, Gary!

17:30.480 --> 17:34.160
A boy that should be at home with his parents, safe and sound,

17:34.160 --> 17:36.920
but he can't be because Gary here

17:36.920 --> 17:39.360
decided to use the basement of my website

17:39.360 --> 17:42.120
to open up a fun park for paedophiles.

17:44.760 --> 17:50.400
So, yeah, you know, parts of this are gonna be uncomfortable, Jesse.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.480
But not as uncomfortable as you're gonna feel

17:52.480 --> 17:54.040
if something happens to that kid.

17:55.440 --> 17:57.120
So, buck up.

17:58.360 --> 18:00.320
So...where were we?

18:00.320 --> 18:02.600
Um, housekeeping.

18:02.600 --> 18:04.160
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

18:04.160 --> 18:07.160
Jesse, would you, um...would you mind pulling up what we worked on,

18:07.160 --> 18:09.560
just so we can refresh Gary's memory, if we have to?

18:09.560 --> 18:12.360
Hey, listen, Jan, you've got every right to be upset...

18:12.360 --> 18:13.920
- Upset?
- Every right.

18:13.920 --> 18:15.720
Upset?

18:15.720 --> 18:17.800
- I trusted you.
- I know.

18:17.800 --> 18:19.600
I brought you into my business and my family.

18:19.600 --> 18:21.160
I let you look after Tahila.

18:21.160 --> 18:23.640
What were you gonna do with her, hmm? Hmm?

18:23.640 --> 18:26.000
You gonna sell her to some scumbag for 30 pieces of silver?

18:26.000 --> 18:29.440
- No, of course not, man. Just let me explain.
- Explain?
- Jan, please.

18:29.440 --> 18:32.040
Explain? I don't need your explanation, Judas.

18:32.040 --> 18:34.560
I'll... I'll make up to you. I will.

18:34.560 --> 18:36.040
- Me?
- I'll make it up to you.

18:36.040 --> 18:37.920
You think...you think...

18:37.920 --> 18:40.680
You think this is about me?

18:40.680 --> 18:42.360
Yeah, you know, the fact that you set up

18:42.360 --> 18:43.960
your little business on my website,

18:43.960 --> 18:46.360
potentially exposing it, does piss me off a little.

18:46.360 --> 18:49.160
But exposing all those other people to danger?

18:49.160 --> 18:53.160
Well, I don't think there's a word for how it makes me feel.

18:53.160 --> 18:55.120
HE WHIMPERS AND CRIES OUT

18:56.920 --> 18:58.920
- Where's the boy?
- CHOKING:
- No!

18:58.920 --> 19:01.040
- Where's the boy?
- Jan, no!

19:01.040 --> 19:03.360
- Gary, where's the boy?
- No, please!

19:03.360 --> 19:05.000
Where's the boy?

19:05.000 --> 19:06.440
Jan, stop it!

19:06.440 --> 19:08.560
HE CHOKES

19:10.720 --> 19:12.760
HE GASPS

19:17.720 --> 19:19.320
CRUNCH

19:51.040 --> 19:54.200
No, stop! Please! Stop! Please!

19:54.200 --> 19:55.480
Stop!

20:09.800 --> 20:11.760
No, no...

20:19.360 --> 20:20.480
Jesse!

20:34.680 --> 20:38.280
Do you know what you've done, you fucking, fucking idiot?!

20:40.040 --> 20:42.840
He's the only one who knows where Callum is!

20:48.840 --> 20:50.400
I'm sorry.

20:51.520 --> 20:55.040
- I couldn't stop.
- All of your talk, all your...

20:56.600 --> 20:59.240
..righteous indignation...

21:00.200 --> 21:02.720
What'd you think would end up on the site?

21:02.720 --> 21:06.240
You said anything goes, you put Gary at the wheel,

21:06.240 --> 21:09.360
so this - all this - is on your head.

21:20.520 --> 21:22.440
Hi, could I get a ride into town?

21:22.440 --> 21:24.000
- WOMAN:
- No worries, get in.

21:48.960 --> 21:50.680
No idea where he was calling from?

21:50.680 --> 21:52.080
I just spent the last 12 hours

21:52.080 --> 21:55.080
trying not to imagine him washed up on a beach.

21:55.080 --> 21:57.840
I was too relieved to think about anything else.

22:01.920 --> 22:03.760
What do you think Roth's up to?

22:04.920 --> 22:07.000
He's got some files he obviously stole.

22:09.240 --> 22:12.080
The two guys who got killed had been trying to decrypt them.

22:12.080 --> 22:15.400
That's why he grabbed Jesse, to finish what they started.

22:15.400 --> 22:17.440
No sense of what's inside the files?

22:19.600 --> 22:22.840
Well, it has to be more than paedophilia.

22:22.840 --> 22:25.120
Things are pretty bad there.

22:25.120 --> 22:28.680
Everyone's on edge. It's like fight or flight, 24/7.

22:28.680 --> 22:32.440
Roth's watching the people he loves being shot down in the street.

22:35.680 --> 22:38.000
PHONE CHIMES

22:45.000 --> 22:46.160
Who is that?

22:47.360 --> 22:48.400
I don't know.

23:02.040 --> 23:04.000
DOOR CREAKS

23:07.240 --> 23:08.800
You took your time.

23:11.560 --> 23:13.080
I don't know Roth that well.

23:13.080 --> 23:15.160
I only met him a couple of times.

23:15.160 --> 23:16.800
I'm there cos of his brother-in-law.

23:16.800 --> 23:18.240
That's Remsey?

23:18.240 --> 23:21.120
Which is what leads me to be wearing your shirt right now.

23:21.120 --> 23:23.440
Do you often break into the houses of people you barely know

23:23.440 --> 23:24.600
and steal their wardrobe?

23:24.600 --> 23:27.640
I did not break in. I told your neighbour I was your cousin.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.400
- She showed me where the key was.
- Right.

23:29.400 --> 23:31.920
Straight-out lies and deceptions. Much more palatable.

23:31.920 --> 23:35.000
Remsey's been involved in non-violent protests there

23:35.000 --> 23:36.560
for more than a decade.

23:36.560 --> 23:39.000
Big picture, they want a referendum for independence.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.560
Day-to-day, they want a say in what happens to their land,

23:41.560 --> 23:44.880
to live without threats and intimidation.

23:44.880 --> 23:46.920
That's why he wanted to come to the forum,

23:46.920 --> 23:50.680
to voice the concerns of the locals, before the mine lease is signed.

23:52.680 --> 23:56.200
This is where the two Aussies were killed. The road to Helmston.

23:57.640 --> 23:59.120
Mining what?

23:59.120 --> 24:02.200
- Gold, nickel, some copper.
- Who owns it?

24:02.200 --> 24:06.640
Multinational. Australian, US, British shareholders.

24:06.640 --> 24:10.680
Classic western model - lease the land for a pittance,

24:10.680 --> 24:12.840
exploit the bejesus out of the natural resources,

24:12.840 --> 24:14.560
pay the locals peanuts.

24:14.560 --> 24:16.840
Shock, horror - they're a bit disgruntled,

24:16.840 --> 24:19.160
and every couple of months, tensions boil over.

24:24.200 --> 24:26.960
This is Marcus Kombian.

24:26.960 --> 24:28.480
He was Remsey's 2IC.

24:29.960 --> 24:33.280
They're saying he ambushed the car, shot the two Australians,

24:33.280 --> 24:36.360
and that one of them fired back and killed him.

24:36.360 --> 24:38.400
Which is bullshit.

24:38.400 --> 24:41.800
He was killed at point-blank range, 12 hours later.

24:41.800 --> 24:44.200
I can get statements from three people who saw him

24:44.200 --> 24:45.800
after the attack happened.

24:45.800 --> 24:48.640
What I'm trying to find out is whether the Australian government

24:48.640 --> 24:51.480
know they're being sold a crock or not.

24:51.480 --> 24:53.600
And this leads back to Remsey Gangi

24:53.600 --> 24:55.960
and you being here in my shirt how?

25:00.360 --> 25:04.280
As their leader, Remsey will carry the can for the murders.

25:04.280 --> 25:05.960
They'll say he incited the attack

25:05.960 --> 25:09.280
and, finally, there'll be an excuse to jail him.

25:10.520 --> 25:12.440
He goes to jail,

25:12.440 --> 25:14.280
he's not coming out.

25:15.760 --> 25:18.200
Thought you might be in a position to help me

25:18.200 --> 25:19.800
put a speed bump on the road.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.080
OK, favourite designer?

25:27.080 --> 25:29.000
- Eve Karencho.
- Why?

25:29.000 --> 25:31.840
Because she's the best, because she takes no shit and no prisoners

25:31.840 --> 25:34.480
and won't be pressured into being anything other than who she is.

25:34.480 --> 25:36.520
Very good. Over.

25:39.800 --> 25:43.280
So, Ms Baxter, I, um...

25:43.280 --> 25:47.000
I see, from your application, that you took a couple of years off.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.480
What have you been doing with yourself over that time?

25:49.480 --> 25:51.400
Oh, you know, painkillers in the morning,

25:51.400 --> 25:53.240
daytime telly in the afternoon.

25:53.240 --> 25:54.840
Other side.

25:54.840 --> 25:57.080
You're always telling me to just be myself.

25:58.960 --> 26:01.720
Tell me about the other days.

26:01.720 --> 26:06.040
Uh, tell me about the days volunteering in the gallery.

26:06.040 --> 26:09.200
Tell me what it's like to have real-life experience

26:09.200 --> 26:11.200
and how that makes you much more interesting

26:11.200 --> 26:13.720
than 90% of the cookie-cutter kids popping out of high school.

26:15.880 --> 26:17.240
Come on, tell me.

26:18.360 --> 26:19.880
Lyse?

26:20.960 --> 26:22.320
Lyse...

26:23.840 --> 26:25.200
Shit.

26:25.200 --> 26:28.640
OK, OK, OK, breathe. Big breath. In.

26:29.640 --> 26:31.400
Slowly, in.

26:31.400 --> 26:32.760
Yeah, and out.

26:33.680 --> 26:35.560
Push it out, push it out.

26:35.560 --> 26:37.480
Slow it down. That's it. In.

26:39.760 --> 26:43.200
You are a very bossy...individual.

26:43.200 --> 26:44.720
Just keep breathing.

26:49.520 --> 26:51.000
I will tell them.

26:52.360 --> 26:54.160
You...

26:54.160 --> 26:56.440
You are going to be great.

27:01.360 --> 27:02.840
What kind of person is she?

27:02.840 --> 27:05.240
Marina Baxter?

27:05.240 --> 27:09.520
Well, she's pretty new to the job, but she hasn't screwed it up yet.

27:10.720 --> 27:13.000
She got a leg-up in the last reshuffle

27:13.000 --> 27:15.920
as a strategy to head off criticism of an all-male front bench.

27:17.160 --> 27:19.320
Her daughter was in the '05 Bali bombings.

27:20.320 --> 27:22.560
And they milked it like crazy.

27:22.560 --> 27:25.120
Turned her into a poster child for a whole raft of legislation

27:25.120 --> 27:27.000
they wouldn't have got through otherwise.

27:30.640 --> 27:32.840
The photos need to be in her hands, right?

27:32.840 --> 27:35.080
We need to be able to prove that she saw them.

27:35.080 --> 27:37.760
Yeah, I know, I know.

27:37.760 --> 27:40.280
- Why am I doing this?
- What?

27:40.280 --> 27:42.000
Painting an even larger target on my head

27:42.000 --> 27:44.840
so people from even further away can have a crack?

27:44.840 --> 27:47.000
Cos this is your party trick.

27:48.240 --> 27:49.760
What?

27:49.760 --> 27:53.600
Well, you can see something's not right. Gets you off the couch.

27:53.600 --> 27:55.120
That's your trick.

27:55.120 --> 27:56.680
That's what you got.

27:58.560 --> 28:00.560
There's Erin.

28:00.560 --> 28:01.640
Pretty.

28:02.880 --> 28:05.400
I think this'll go a bit more smoothly if you wait in the car.

28:05.400 --> 28:07.360
Mm. Course you do.

28:16.880 --> 28:19.400
- Hmm.
- I need a favour.

28:19.400 --> 28:20.680
Shock me.

28:21.880 --> 28:25.520
Marina Baxter is meeting a cultural delegation in the CBD today

28:25.520 --> 28:28.000
and I need to get close enough to ask a few questions.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.240
I need a pass.

28:31.360 --> 28:33.080
- MAN:
- That's when we tell all of the parties

28:33.080 --> 28:34.880
they'll have a chance to present their cases.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.920
There's no point making a pre-emptive move

28:36.920 --> 28:38.400
if there's going to be a challenge.

28:39.600 --> 28:41.400
Minister, I wonder if you'd have a minute

28:41.400 --> 28:44.080
- to have a look at these pictures.
- Sorry, you are?
- Ned Banks.

28:44.080 --> 28:46.760
My brother and I have been caught up in your efforts to find Jan Roth.

28:46.760 --> 28:49.400
You might remember my name from a US extradition request.

28:49.400 --> 28:51.560
This is Marcus Kombian,

28:51.560 --> 28:55.840
the man accused of killing Eric Bell and Christo Borst in West Papua -

28:55.840 --> 28:57.880
shot with a single bullet to the forehead.

28:57.880 --> 29:00.320
CAMERA CLICKS

29:11.920 --> 29:13.560
Mr Banks, if you have...

29:13.560 --> 29:15.480
Now, I'm not a ballistics expert, but that wound

29:15.480 --> 29:17.680
comes from point-blank range, not from 50 metres away.

29:17.680 --> 29:19.920
The media are reporting that he was killed in the attack,

29:19.920 --> 29:21.840
based on information coming out of your office.

29:21.840 --> 29:23.400
But he wasn't even there at the time.

29:23.400 --> 29:25.160
- How do you know that?
- There are witnesses.

29:25.160 --> 29:27.920
People who saw him alive five or six hours after the attack.

29:27.920 --> 29:31.880
Uh, the Minister's not making statements to the press today.

29:31.880 --> 29:33.280
She's been sold a lie -

29:33.280 --> 29:35.440
an extrajudicial killing dressed up as act of terror.

29:35.440 --> 29:37.600
She doesn't want to make a statement about that?

29:39.560 --> 29:42.680
It's me. Can you find out who she is and get back to me?

29:42.680 --> 29:45.120
If you do find out who she is, I want a copy of those photographs

29:45.120 --> 29:47.200
to take to the security briefing meeting tonight.

29:47.200 --> 29:48.840
No, no, no, absolutely not.

29:48.840 --> 29:50.840
Two things - you need to think very carefully

29:50.840 --> 29:52.520
about heading in there half-cocked

29:52.520 --> 29:54.480
based on a press hijack we can't validate.

29:54.480 --> 29:55.800
What if they're right, Will?

29:55.800 --> 29:58.800
I'm out there on the hustings, selling this as an act of terror

29:58.800 --> 30:00.400
and if there is any doubt,

30:00.400 --> 30:02.280
not to mention the fact that if word gets out

30:02.280 --> 30:03.560
that I saw those photographs

30:03.560 --> 30:06.440
which clearly show he was being used as a patsy, and I didn't act...

30:06.440 --> 30:08.880
No, I have to at least ask the question.

30:08.880 --> 30:10.440
OK. All right, fine.

30:10.440 --> 30:12.440
You can ask the question, but just not in there,

30:12.440 --> 30:14.800
and not until you know what you're actually dealing with.

30:14.800 --> 30:16.960
You do, they are gonna eat you alive.

30:16.960 --> 30:18.680
So, what's the other thing?

30:18.680 --> 30:20.720
- Oh, the meeting's been moved.
- To when?

30:20.720 --> 30:23.360
Uh...in six...

30:23.360 --> 30:25.280
No, actually, make that five minutes.

30:25.280 --> 30:28.240
I have to take my daughter to an interview at two.

30:28.240 --> 30:30.320
Well, you'd better hope it's a short session.

30:36.960 --> 30:39.120
Would you even know who these security forces

30:39.120 --> 30:40.760
in the pictures were?

30:40.760 --> 30:42.560
- No...
- TNI? Police?

30:42.560 --> 30:45.000
Militia? Detachment 88?

30:45.000 --> 30:48.040
A different wing of the separatists?

30:48.040 --> 30:50.200
- I don't have all the answers, Neil.
- Clearly.

30:50.200 --> 30:52.280
But I'm on the news every night talking about this

30:52.280 --> 30:53.680
and we don't have all the facts.

30:53.680 --> 30:55.360
For God's sake!

30:55.360 --> 30:58.080
I'm writing letters to the parents of these two boys killed,

30:58.080 --> 30:59.960
telling that them justice is being served.

30:59.960 --> 31:01.480
And what's the alternative?

31:01.480 --> 31:03.280
An innocent man gunned down on the street

31:03.280 --> 31:05.120
and another in a detention centre?

31:05.120 --> 31:06.960
I can't ignore the accusation.

31:06.960 --> 31:10.760
No-one's suggesting you do, Marina, but the last time I looked,

31:10.760 --> 31:13.600
our priority in the region was supporting a fledgling democracy

31:13.600 --> 31:16.120
in its fight against radical terrorists.

31:16.120 --> 31:19.200
The shitstorm we're looking at if Indonesia fails to pull that off!

31:19.200 --> 31:23.240
But you want to go in there and suggest we reset the agenda,

31:23.240 --> 31:25.480
be my guest.

31:25.480 --> 31:27.960
Let's take a five-minute break before we go in.

31:33.880 --> 31:35.280
Sweetheart?

31:35.280 --> 31:38.880
Sweetheart, this is gonna upset you, but, uh, our meeting got moved.

31:38.880 --> 31:42.200
So, I've ordered a cab to come and pick you up

31:42.200 --> 31:43.880
and I'll be there as soon as I can.

31:46.240 --> 31:47.680
Sweetheart, can you pick up?

31:47.680 --> 31:50.080
Just so that I know you've got the message.

31:50.080 --> 31:52.760
Uh, the cab'll be there soon.

31:52.760 --> 31:55.800
Just...remember to breathe.

31:57.080 --> 31:59.360
You know... OK, bye.

32:01.200 --> 32:02.680
SHE SIGHS

32:02.680 --> 32:05.880
Alyse's university interview. I was meant to be taking her.

32:07.080 --> 32:08.720
Ouch.

32:08.720 --> 32:12.040
The odds for me winning the worst mother of the year award

32:12.040 --> 32:13.640
just went through the roof.

32:15.360 --> 32:17.000
I could, um...

32:19.400 --> 32:22.520
Mention this to Neil, he will take my first-born,

32:22.520 --> 32:26.800
but...I could look into the pictures,

32:26.800 --> 32:28.920
see what the level of credibility is.

32:30.160 --> 32:31.920
Where did they come from?

32:33.600 --> 32:35.560
CLEARS THROAT

32:35.560 --> 32:37.200
Ned Banks.

32:39.760 --> 32:41.840
Ned Banks.

33:06.600 --> 33:08.800
PHONE RINGS

33:16.920 --> 33:18.480
Ned Banks.

33:22.600 --> 33:23.840
They found him.

33:30.760 --> 33:33.600
- HE SIGHS
- Oh, God.

33:44.040 --> 33:47.000
You'll wear a hole in that floor.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
No charge for waiting inside.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.800
I told them we'd meet them out here.

33:50.800 --> 33:52.520
Oh, but you'd already know that

33:52.520 --> 33:54.720
because you've been monitoring my devices.

33:56.360 --> 33:58.160
You must be loving this.

33:58.160 --> 34:03.080
Little boy lost, swallowed alive by the boogie men of the dark net.

34:03.080 --> 34:05.120
Thank God things like this happen from time to time

34:05.120 --> 34:07.120
so you can scare the shit out of everyone.

34:07.120 --> 34:10.000
Now, hand over your right to privacy

34:10.000 --> 34:12.800
and we'll only use it against the bad guys.

34:12.800 --> 34:14.320
Goodness.

34:14.320 --> 34:18.480
It just occurred to me that Jesse's condition could be...genetic?

34:18.480 --> 34:19.960
HE CHUCKLES

34:20.960 --> 34:22.600
Have we met before?

34:23.800 --> 34:25.679
You look very familiar.

34:26.639 --> 34:28.440
- It'll come to me.
- NED:
- Here he is.

34:34.639 --> 34:36.280
Hey.

34:36.280 --> 34:38.280
- Hey.
- Hi.

34:39.840 --> 34:42.159
You OK? Enough with the disappearing

34:42.159 --> 34:44.760
off the face of the earth acts, all right?

34:46.560 --> 34:48.360
So, how do you usually work this?

34:48.360 --> 34:51.120
Well, Jesse's gonna help us with a few more things.

34:51.120 --> 34:53.080
There's still a chance we can find Callum.

34:54.840 --> 34:56.760
I need to finish it, Ned.

35:02.040 --> 35:04.240
Why aren't you just raiding Gary's place?

35:04.240 --> 35:06.840
If we knew where his place was, we would.

35:06.840 --> 35:09.600
But he wasn't silly enough to put anything in his name.

35:09.600 --> 35:12.960
From this point forward, Roth had no knowledge of anything.

35:12.960 --> 35:15.320
From here, it's all Gary.

35:22.800 --> 35:25.040
These messages, they're new.

35:29.880 --> 35:31.400
Oh, no.

35:33.600 --> 35:34.880
No.

35:39.400 --> 35:41.400
Well, that's it. That's over.

35:42.480 --> 35:44.720
Gary's dead and the only person who knows where Callum is

35:44.720 --> 35:46.080
is on his way to get him.

37:08.120 --> 37:10.800
Any reason someone would send you a private message here?

37:10.800 --> 37:11.880
You've got mail.

37:12.960 --> 37:14.560
From who?

37:14.560 --> 37:17.080
Someone smart enough to use a guerrilla mail service.

37:17.080 --> 37:18.360
No IP trace.

37:18.360 --> 37:20.000
Dale Anderson.

37:34.120 --> 37:37.640
HeBeLove is Dale Anderson.

37:37.640 --> 37:39.120
That message, it's from Roth.

37:39.120 --> 37:41.200
He's telling us to find Dale Anderson.

37:41.200 --> 37:44.200
I wouldn't mount your white horse just yet.

37:45.560 --> 37:48.200
That's assuming it's actually the guy's real name.

37:48.200 --> 37:51.000
Well, run the dragnet on it. We've got warrants to go all the way.

38:38.480 --> 38:39.960
He broke down one day.

38:39.960 --> 38:42.520
He was c...complaining about his mechanic -

38:42.520 --> 38:44.680
that they'd put the wrong petrol in the van.

38:44.680 --> 38:46.400
Who? Dale?

38:46.400 --> 38:48.960
He...he was complaining to Gary about it.

38:55.880 --> 38:57.880
"How hard can it be? It's not rocket science.

38:57.880 --> 39:00.560
"There's a label, for Christ's sake."

39:00.560 --> 39:04.200
"Yeah, but that would require the mechanic being able to read."

39:07.400 --> 39:10.600
He drives a diesel van. He drives a diesel van.

39:10.600 --> 39:13.880
You need to find the Dale Anderson who drives a diesel van.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.040
- Two Australian matches.
- Where?

39:25.040 --> 39:27.520
One in South Australia, one in Sydney.

39:32.800 --> 39:35.880
- LARA:
- OK, let's go with him. Bring up his bank records.

39:44.480 --> 39:45.880
He's been in Singapore.

39:47.520 --> 39:50.440
Lands in Canberra at 5:15.

39:50.440 --> 39:53.160
APPLAUSE

40:12.440 --> 40:14.480
Lands in 45 minutes.

40:19.600 --> 40:21.040
Thank you.

40:21.040 --> 40:22.720
It's all his work.

40:27.840 --> 40:29.720
Thanks.

40:29.720 --> 40:31.960
My pleasure.

40:31.960 --> 40:34.080
But it'd be less than truthful if I didn't tell you

40:34.080 --> 40:36.080
I was getting myself out of trouble

40:36.080 --> 40:37.560
at the same time.

40:37.560 --> 40:39.880
Listen, I'm going to get Rowan to come and pick you guys up,

40:39.880 --> 40:41.240
and as soon as we get an address,

40:41.240 --> 40:43.440
we'll get you as close as we can, OK?

40:44.520 --> 40:48.560
We'll deal with your extradition warrants first thing in the morning.

40:59.040 --> 41:00.520
You did good, Jesse.

41:05.720 --> 41:07.360
Really. I'm so proud of you.

41:09.240 --> 41:11.920
I feel strangely pleased to have managed that.

41:13.880 --> 41:15.920
Good.

41:15.920 --> 41:17.440
Yep.

41:18.400 --> 41:19.960
Good.

41:19.960 --> 41:21.640
You said that.

41:21.640 --> 41:23.080
Yeah.

41:24.600 --> 41:27.280
Jesse, Lara wants to see you.

41:27.280 --> 41:28.520
Oh.

41:30.760 --> 41:32.440
Ned...

41:36.080 --> 41:37.400
Hello, Hani.

41:47.880 --> 41:50.160
Bring Nolan's feed into the centre.

41:55.040 --> 41:58.600
Officer Collins has identified the target from the manifest.

42:05.720 --> 42:08.240
She's escorting him out the main doors.

42:11.680 --> 42:14.400
They're moving towards the taxi now. Stand by, Williams.

42:24.240 --> 42:26.360
G'day, mate.

42:26.360 --> 42:29.560
- Where to, mate?
- Fyshwick.

42:29.560 --> 42:31.440
Got an address?

42:31.440 --> 42:32.480
For the GPS.

42:33.720 --> 42:34.960
Yeah.

42:40.040 --> 42:42.480
5/86 Lenton Avenue.

42:42.480 --> 42:44.920
Verify it's not his address.

42:44.920 --> 42:47.600
Unit 5, 86 Lenton Avenue.

42:52.760 --> 42:54.560

You just have to wait here for a second.

Rock...you.

46:22.160 --> 46:24.640
I swear, once you're inside, you could be on Mars.

46:27.880 --> 46:31.080
It's good to be the most resource-rich country on earth, eh?

46:32.480 --> 46:36.040
I'm struggling to get my head around how they let you take a job there,

46:36.040 --> 46:38.360
given your track record of shit-stirring.

46:40.120 --> 46:43.080
All that fire and brimstone you have in your twenties,

46:43.080 --> 46:45.480
when it feels good just to be angry...

46:45.480 --> 46:48.600
Well, you know, we all grow up

46:48.600 --> 46:51.120
and realise the world is a more complex place.

46:51.120 --> 46:53.680
- And they bought that?
- Clearly.

46:55.240 --> 46:58.520
And then there's the fact that I gave them my married name.

46:59.880 --> 47:03.880
The one dividend from never getting around to updating the paperwork.

47:04.880 --> 47:07.120
- Hmm.
- PHONE CHIMES

47:12.320 --> 47:14.960
Oh, dear. You're in the doghouse.

47:14.960 --> 47:17.400
No, really... please, read my messages.

47:17.400 --> 47:18.600
Sorry.

47:18.600 --> 47:20.880
I've been hanging out with journalists too long.

47:20.880 --> 47:23.240
Well, you've looked at it now, so what'd she say?

47:25.040 --> 47:28.040
"Thought yesterday's favour might have at least earned me

47:28.040 --> 47:29.720
"an invitation for dinner."

47:32.680 --> 47:36.080
There was an earlier one from your dad, wanting to see you too.

47:39.280 --> 47:43.760
Do you want some space? I can get out of your hair.

47:43.760 --> 47:45.000
Nope.

47:47.160 --> 47:48.280
No need.

47:59.200 --> 48:01.160
I wanted to say that, uh...

48:03.000 --> 48:05.520
..if I've ever been one of those people...

48:07.000 --> 48:11.320
..even for one second, who've underestimated you...

48:13.880 --> 48:16.560
..I'm so, so sorry for that.

48:19.640 --> 48:23.680
If the ground between us is uneven, it's uneven in my favour, not yours.

48:30.760 --> 48:32.880
Oh, babe.

48:38.480 --> 48:40.520
It was so horrible.

48:42.720 --> 48:44.080
Ahh!

48:44.080 --> 48:45.760
Don't go back there.

- Follow where?
- To the detention centre!

49:42.480 --> 49:45.000
PHONE RINGS

49:53.920 --> 49:55.440
Hey.

49:55.440 --> 49:57.040
I don't... What?

49:57.040 --> 49:58.760
No, I don't know about Nasim.

49:58.760 --> 50:00.960
This...this is an extradition order for both of us.

50:00.960 --> 50:03.040
You...you have to come over here, Jess.

50:04.240 --> 50:06.760
I don't understand what's happening.

50:06.760 --> 50:08.600
- I thought we had a deal.
- I know.

50:08.600 --> 50:11.560
But by the time I got back to the office and calls had been made...

50:11.560 --> 50:13.760
There's a sense that the task

50:13.760 --> 50:16.720
was to deliver Roth's hard drive, or at least get access to it,

50:16.720 --> 50:18.640
and Jesse didn't do that.

50:18.640 --> 50:20.960
This is fuckin' Lara, isn't it?

50:20.960 --> 50:23.680
It was never about Callum.

50:23.680 --> 50:25.120
Call your lawyer.

50:25.120 --> 50:27.400
Get him to prepare a bail application.

50:27.400 --> 50:29.520
You'll have 30 days to fight it.

50:30.920 --> 50:32.640
I'm sorry, Ned.

50:36.680 --> 50:38.240
I can't see any other way.

50:38.240 --> 50:40.200
If you can crack Roth's file,

50:40.200 --> 50:43.080
well, at least we'd know what we were dealing with.

50:43.080 --> 50:45.040
How does it help Hani's dad?

50:46.280 --> 50:48.680
Someone lost something that they clearly want back.

50:48.680 --> 50:52.880
If I was in a position to return it, then I've got something to trade.

50:52.880 --> 50:55.800
- So, you want to go back to Papua?
- No, I don't.

50:55.800 --> 50:58.040
I do not want to go back there ever again.

50:58.040 --> 50:59.880
I don't want to go back there, even in my mind,

50:59.880 --> 51:02.560
but, uh, we've got nothing to fight with.

51:04.520 --> 51:06.760
Do you have any idea of the trouble I'd get into

51:06.760 --> 51:09.520
if I get caught smuggling two fugitives back into the country?

51:09.520 --> 51:12.400
Yeah, I have some idea.

51:12.400 --> 51:15.200
That's your party trick, though, isn't it?

51:18.320 --> 51:21.440
I usually hitch a ride back with one of the mine pilots.

51:22.680 --> 51:24.440
Let me make a few calls.

51:45.160 --> 51:46.280
Ha...

51:53.480 --> 51:56.680
Jan Roth used to work for Offensive Cyber Ops.

51:56.680 --> 51:57.960
Mm.

52:01.760 --> 52:05.040
Uh...they're one of the, um...

52:06.320 --> 52:11.480
..hardest-core intelligence units working for the American government.

52:36.320 --> 52:37.640
COMPUTER BEEPS

52:50.800 --> 52:53.840
Why are you still awake, little squirrel?

52:53.840 --> 52:55.000
Scared.

53:03.040 --> 53:04.320
Scared?

53:05.560 --> 53:07.600
Hanuman the Monkey King?

53:08.520 --> 53:10.520
Why would you be scared...

53:10.520 --> 53:13.560
when you're best friends with the most handsome prince

53:13.560 --> 53:15.520
that ever walked the earth?

53:15.520 --> 53:17.440
Not THAT handsome.

53:17.440 --> 53:18.960
Oh... Hmm.

53:19.920 --> 53:22.640
Best friends with Prince Rama,

53:22.640 --> 53:25.440
the most handsome prince that ever walked the earth.

53:26.680 --> 53:29.200
And together they went to rescue

53:29.200 --> 53:32.440
the beautiful and the wise...

53:32.440 --> 53:34.720
Princess Sita.

53:43.000 --> 53:47.800
..who has been taken by the Demon King, Ravana.

53:55.480 --> 53:59.480
It was a long, long, fierce battle -

53:59.480 --> 54:03.040
the enemy so powerful that they could regrow their limbs

54:03.040 --> 54:06.000
as fast as Prince Rama could cut them off.

54:17.120 --> 54:18.880
DOOR OPENS

54:18.880 --> 54:20.200
- HANI:
- Ned?

54:23.560 --> 54:24.760
Jesse?

54:44.280 --> 54:46.040
Until the very end.

54:46.040 --> 54:49.840
It was a battle to the death.

55:06.040 --> 55:09.560
JESSE: "I'm gambling, Hani Parande, girlfriend of exactly 15 weeks,

55:09.560 --> 55:12.600
"that you'll know me well enough to find your way to this message.

55:13.680 --> 55:16.880
"I'm gonna get the files they want, and trade them for your dad."

55:18.280 --> 55:23.640
And Prince Rama and Princess Sita were reunited.

55:28.840 --> 55:32.480
And their loyal friend, Hanuman...

55:34.360 --> 55:37.960
..flies on ahead to ask the villagers

55:37.960 --> 55:40.080
to light the paths with lamps...

55:41.920 --> 55:45.040
..so the couple can find their way home.

55:46.305 --> 55:52.573
