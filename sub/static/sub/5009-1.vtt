00:25.959 --> 00:30.692
<i>Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.</i>

00:30.797 --> 00:33.994
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done...

00:34.100 --> 00:37.365
on Earth as it is in heaven.

00:37.470 --> 00:40.240
Give us this day our daily bread...

00:40.340 --> 00:42.542
and forgive us our trespasses...

00:42.642 --> 00:46.704
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

00:46.814 --> 00:49.942
And lead us not into temptation...

00:50.051 --> 00:52.918
but deliver us from evil.

00:53.020 --> 00:56.421
For Thine is the kingdom, the power...

00:56.524 --> 01:00.824
and the glory now and forever.

01:00.928 --> 01:02.928
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.569
Thank you, Father Macklepenny...

01:08.669 --> 01:13.207
for coming all the way
across town to be our guest speaker.

01:13.307 --> 01:16.112
<i>When I raise my flashing sword...</i>

01:17.311 --> 01:20.457
<i>and my hand takes hold on judgment...</i>

01:22.317 --> 01:25.717
<i>I will take vengeance upon mine enemies.</i>

01:26.421 --> 01:29.481
<i>And I will repay those who haste me.</i>

01:30.158 --> 01:33.161
<i>O Lord, raise me to Thy right hand...</i>

01:33.261 --> 01:35.811
<i>and count me among Thy saints.</i>

01:41.269 --> 01:44.414
And I am reminded on this holy day...

01:45.574 --> 01:49.340
<i>of the sad story of Kitty Genovese.</i>

01:52.080 --> 01:55.983
<i>As you all may remember...</i>

01:56.085 --> 01:59.122
a long time ago,
almost 30 years ago...

01:59.222 --> 02:03.352
<i>this poor soul cried out for help...</i>

02:03.459 --> 02:05.984
<i>time and time again...</i>

02:06.095 --> 02:09.963
<i>but no person answered her calls.</i>

02:11.767 --> 02:13.962
Though many saw...

02:14.070 --> 02:17.130
no one so much as called the police.

02:18.774 --> 02:23.789
<i>They all just watched as Kitty
was being stabbed to death...</i>

02:24.247 --> 02:26.579
in broad daylight.

02:26.682 --> 02:31.279
They watched as
her assailant walked away.

02:33.390 --> 02:37.986
Now, we must all fear evil men.

02:39.963 --> 02:43.194
<i>But there is another kind of evil...</i>

02:43.300 --> 02:45.928
which we must fear most...

02:48.105 --> 02:51.802
and that is the indifference...

02:51.909 --> 02:55.174
<i>of good men!</i>

03:14.933 --> 03:18.036
I do believe the monsignor's
finally got the point.

03:18.136 --> 03:20.136
Aye.

03:54.607 --> 03:56.607
<i>Hey, Conner!</i>

04:04.750 --> 04:06.750
What?

04:17.664 --> 04:20.029
Yeah!
Who's the master?

04:26.906 --> 04:28.808
You're gonna be training her today.

04:28.908 --> 04:31.433
Aye.

04:38.718 --> 04:43.903
- Basically, the rule of thumb here is-
- Wait. Rule of thumb?

04:49.330 --> 04:53.201
In the early 1900s, it was legal
for men to beat their wives...

04:53.301 --> 04:57.891
as long as they used a stick
no wider than their thumb.

05:03.144 --> 05:05.079
Can't do much damage
with that then, can we?

05:05.179 --> 05:09.004
Perhaps it should've been
the "rule of wrist."

05:12.420 --> 05:14.455
I knew you two pricks
would give me problems.

05:14.555 --> 05:17.191
Come on. It's St. Patty's Day.
It's all in good fun.

05:17.291 --> 05:19.841
Ah, fuck you!
And fuck you too!

05:20.628 --> 05:23.944
We're sorry, all right?
Just-Just relax.

05:26.568 --> 05:28.661
Oh, shit.

06:27.530 --> 06:30.080
Hey, fuck-ass, give me a beer.

06:40.511 --> 06:44.106
Listen, boys, I've got some very bad news.

06:44.214 --> 06:48.207
I'm gonna have to close down t-t-the bar.

06:48.318 --> 06:53.290
The Russians are buying up buildings
all over the town, includin' this one.

06:53.390 --> 06:55.620
Fuck! Ass!

06:55.726 --> 06:58.262
And they're not lettin' me renew my lease.

06:58.362 --> 07:01.195
Let me talk to my boss.

07:01.298 --> 07:05.069
- Maybe he can do something.
- What the fuck's your boss gonna do?

07:05.169 --> 07:07.971
Listen, fellas,
I don't want anyone to know.

07:08.071 --> 07:10.141
So you keep your traps shut!

07:10.241 --> 07:15.426
You know what they say:
People in glass houses sink s-s-ships.

07:18.850 --> 07:22.020
Hey, Doc, I gotta buy you,
like, a proverb book or somethin'.

07:22.120 --> 07:24.622
This mix-and-match shit's gotta go.

07:24.722 --> 07:26.091
What?

07:26.191 --> 07:28.460
A penny saved is worth
two in the bush, isn't it?

07:28.560 --> 07:33.660
And don't cross the road
if you can't get out of the kitchen.

07:39.871 --> 07:41.773
What's this, then?

07:41.873 --> 07:46.902
I am Ivan Checkov,
and you will be closing now.

07:52.885 --> 07:54.910
Checkov.

07:55.020 --> 08:00.715
Well, this here's McCoy. We find
a Spock, we've got us an away team.

08:02.995 --> 08:05.998
Me in no mood for discussion.
You, you stay.

08:06.098 --> 08:08.828
The rest of you, go now.

08:08.934 --> 08:13.949
Why don't you make like a tree
and get the fuck out of here!

08:17.309 --> 08:19.212
You know he's got
till the week's end, right?

08:19.312 --> 08:21.681
<i>You don't have to be hard-asses, do ya?</i>

08:21.781 --> 08:24.046
It's St. Patty's Day.
Everyone's Irish tonight.

08:24.146 --> 08:24.418
Mmm.

08:24.518 --> 08:26.753
Why don't you just pull up a stool
and have a drink with us?

08:26.853 --> 08:29.356
This is no game! If you won't go...

08:29.456 --> 08:32.049
we will make you go.

08:49.676 --> 08:52.846
So these two guys are kickin'
the shit out of each other, right?

08:52.946 --> 08:55.817
<i>This guy picks up
an old kitchen sink or something...</i>

08:55.917 --> 08:58.186
<i>and fuckin' crushes this guy with it.</i>

08:58.286 --> 09:01.414
<i>It makes a big bang.</i>

09:24.912 --> 09:28.149
Look at him. His spine's all crushed.
Had to be one big motherfucker.

09:28.249 --> 09:32.243
<i>Huge. Three, four hundred pounds.
Fuckin' huge.</i>

09:32.354 --> 09:35.159
- That's pretty thin.
- Very thin.

09:40.128 --> 09:42.460
<i>Okay.
All right, all right.</i>

09:42.564 --> 09:45.100
<i>Say these two guys right here, they don't
even know the fuckin' huge guy.</i>

09:45.200 --> 09:46.805
They're just staggering
home from a bar still...

09:46.905 --> 09:48.303
all fucked up from St. Patty's last night.

09:48.403 --> 09:51.039
They decide to take a shortcut
down through the alley.

09:51.139 --> 09:53.334
Wrong fuckin' alley, huh?

09:53.442 --> 09:55.711
'Cause this big motherfucker,
he's just waitin' for 'em, right?

09:55.811 --> 09:58.105
And what could be more perfect
for a strong-arm robbery?

09:58.205 --> 09:59.515
Two drunk guys all bandaged up.

09:59.615 --> 10:02.084
<i>They're already injured,
for Christ's sakes. Look at 'em.</i>

10:02.184 --> 10:05.555
<i>These guys are stumblin' through the alley.</i>

10:05.655 --> 10:07.991
This guy takes a blunt object,
fuckin'-Waah!

10:08.091 --> 10:11.361
Hits the guy with the bandages around
his head, right? Why? 'Cause he's smart.

10:11.461 --> 10:14.664
<i>He knows the guy with the bandage
around his ass, he ain't goin' nowhere.</i>

10:14.764 --> 10:17.358
<i>He's goin' fuckin' nowhere!</i>

10:17.467 --> 10:21.037
Where are you goin'?
Nowhere! That's right.

10:22.905 --> 10:25.441
He ain't done yet. He comes over
and jumps on this guy's back...

10:25.541 --> 10:27.666
and crushes him to death.

10:29.078 --> 10:31.281
I feel something big here.

10:31.381 --> 10:33.550
I wouldn't be surprised to see
a lot of these turnin' up.

10:33.650 --> 10:35.552
<i>Brilliant!</i>

10:35.652 --> 10:38.746
So now we got a huge guy theory...

10:38.855 --> 10:41.290
and a serial crusher theory.

10:41.392 --> 10:43.451
Top notch.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.796
- What's your name?
- Detective Greenly.

10:45.896 --> 10:50.067
- Who the fuck are you?
- That's who the fuck I am.

10:50.167 --> 10:53.534
<i>Listen, I gotta do this by the numbers.</i>

10:53.637 --> 10:56.407
I.D. Just came back on these guys.

10:56.507 --> 10:58.642
They got connections
with the Russian mob.

10:58.742 --> 11:01.506
<i>That makes it a federal matter.</i>

11:01.612 --> 11:06.083
<i>And Agent Smecker here is heading up
the investigation with our full cooperation.</i>

11:06.183 --> 11:09.386
- Why don't you get me a cup of coffee?
- Who the hell is this?

11:09.486 --> 11:11.522
- A cafÃ© latte, twist of lemon...
- What the fuck...

11:11.622 --> 11:15.533
- Chief, what the fuck is this?
- Sweet 'N Low.

13:32.300 --> 13:34.325
Mitchell, Langley!

13:34.435 --> 13:37.439
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Find the manager of this building.</i>

13:37.539 --> 13:40.442
See if he's had any complaints
of water coming down...

13:40.542 --> 13:42.711
in any of the apartments
starting just this morning.

13:42.811 --> 13:46.466
Langley, you take that building.
Same thing.

13:46.748 --> 13:49.114
Chaffey! Newman!

13:49.218 --> 13:52.387
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Look in the trash around their hands.</i>

13:52.487 --> 13:55.390
See if you can find me two bullet casings...

13:55.490 --> 13:58.890
fifty-caliber if my eyes serve me right.

13:59.061 --> 14:02.360
Newman, rip through this shit.

14:02.464 --> 14:04.830
If this was a sink...

14:04.933 --> 14:06.835
find me some metal parts.

14:06.935 --> 14:10.506
Give me a drain cover,
faucet or something.

14:12.675 --> 14:14.611
Got it right here.
It's a 50-cal.

14:14.711 --> 14:17.680
Chief, can you get ballistics down here...

14:17.780 --> 14:20.450
and tell 'em they have to dig
a 50-caliber slug...

14:20.550 --> 14:23.419
out of a brick wall and locate another
that's been fired through a Dumpster?

14:23.519 --> 14:25.421
We have the best
ballistics guy in the world.

14:25.521 --> 14:28.191
- I can have him here in ten minutes.
- How did you know that?

14:28.291 --> 14:30.291
Liquid paraffin.

14:30.393 --> 14:32.657
Came up positive.

14:32.762 --> 14:35.064
And bullet holes are usually a big clue.

14:35.164 --> 14:37.400
Nobody reported any gunshots.

14:37.500 --> 14:40.937
This is an Irish neighborhood.
I'm surprised you even got a phone call.

14:41.037 --> 14:43.773
<i>You know, I can't find the second one, sir.</i>

14:43.873 --> 14:45.874
Look under the body.

14:49.046 --> 14:51.378
Oh, yeah, there it is.

14:53.550 --> 14:55.711
You guys ready for this?

14:55.819 --> 14:59.050
This was no gangland assassination.

14:59.156 --> 15:01.759
Though creative,
it was way too sloppy.

15:01.859 --> 15:05.162
Something went wrong here.
This has "personal" written all over it.

15:05.262 --> 15:08.566
<i>Agent Smecker.
Yeah, this is all illegal loft housing.</i>

15:08.666 --> 15:11.435
There's no manager on the premises,
but they found a lady on the fourth floor...

15:11.535 --> 15:13.704
who said she had water dripping
down on her whole place.

15:13.804 --> 15:15.973
- It started just this morning.
- Fourth floor, huh?

15:16.073 --> 15:18.073
Mm-hmm.

15:19.276 --> 15:21.413
Then we're headin' to the fifth.

15:21.513 --> 15:24.282
<i>Come on. Let's get out of here.
You're reachin', man.</i>

15:24.382 --> 15:26.852
- It's a theory.
- I don't know. No way.

15:26.952 --> 15:29.821
You know how big a guy's
gotta be to do that? Fuckin' huge.

15:29.921 --> 15:34.851
Oh, really? I might just be
wantin' a bagel with my coffee.

15:40.899 --> 15:44.044
I ain't gettin' him no fuckin' bagel.

15:51.943 --> 15:55.089
<i>We'll start the ass kissing with you.</i>

15:58.617 --> 16:01.017
<i>Agent Smecker. Agent-</i>

16:01.120 --> 16:02.955
Listen, I know this neighborhood
pretty good.

16:03.055 --> 16:04.957
There's a bar down the block
named McGinty's.

16:05.057 --> 16:06.892
- It stands a good chance
they were there last night.

16:06.992 --> 16:07.693
Good work, Mitchell.

16:07.793 --> 16:10.318
I'll check it out myself.

16:10.429 --> 16:13.165
<i>Look at the ceiling.
Sense of touch alone.</i>

16:13.265 --> 16:15.301
Wait until you feel me move.
Ooh.

16:15.401 --> 16:18.037
So quick you couldn't
even feel it go, could you?

16:18.137 --> 16:21.140
<i>Let's try it again.
Try it again. Look at the ceiling.</i>

16:21.240 --> 16:23.240
It's Doc.

16:25.511 --> 16:29.140
- Thanks for comin', Doc.
- Jesus Christ!

16:29.248 --> 16:32.586
What the fuck happened?
Are-Are you b-b-boys all right?

16:32.686 --> 16:36.056
- We're alive.
- An F.B.I. Agent came by the bar...

16:36.156 --> 16:38.058
and he left me his c-c-ca-

16:38.158 --> 16:41.595
He left me his c-c-
Oh, he fuckin' gave me this. Fuck!

16:41.695 --> 16:43.997
<i>Ass! What are you gonna do?</i>

16:44.097 --> 16:46.566
We oughta turn ourselves in,
tell him it was self-defense.

16:46.666 --> 16:48.502
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's what he said.

16:48.602 --> 16:50.317
How the fuck's he know that?
We haven't spoken to anyone.

16:50.417 --> 16:53.531
- D-D-Don't know.
- He d-d-didn't say.

16:53.640 --> 16:56.176
All right. Listen, Doc,
we need you to do us a favor.

16:56.276 --> 16:58.879
- A-A-Anything.
- Just hold on to this for us.

16:58.979 --> 17:00.793
We're gonna come back
for it when we get out.

17:00.893 --> 17:03.181
Right.
Fuck! Ass!

17:05.286 --> 17:10.215
None of that cursing was directed at you.
He's- He's a bit-

17:12.993 --> 17:14.896
First of all...

17:14.996 --> 17:18.066
I'd like to thank whichever one of you...

17:18.165 --> 17:21.294
doughnut-munching,
barrel-assed...

17:21.402 --> 17:25.227
pud-pulling sissies leaked this to the press.

17:26.374 --> 17:28.309
That's just what we need now...

17:28.409 --> 17:30.411
some sensational story in the papers...

17:30.511 --> 17:35.450
making these boys out to be
superheroes triumphing over evil.

17:35.550 --> 17:38.383
Let me squash the rumors now.

17:38.486 --> 17:41.081
These two are not heroes.

17:42.858 --> 17:45.160
They're just two ordinary men...

17:45.260 --> 17:48.964
who were put in
an extraordinary situation...

17:49.064 --> 17:51.400
and they just happened to come out on top.

17:51.500 --> 17:55.437
Yes, nothing from our
far-reaching computer system...

17:55.537 --> 17:57.439
has turned up diddly on these two.

17:57.539 --> 17:59.908
All we know is what
we found out from the neighbors.

18:00.008 --> 18:02.643
And the general consensus is...

18:04.680 --> 18:06.680
they're angels.

18:09.384 --> 18:12.114
But angels don't kill.

18:12.221 --> 18:14.857
And we got two bodies in the morgue...

18:14.957 --> 18:17.293
that look like they've been serial-crushed...

18:17.393 --> 18:21.090
by some huge, friggin' guy.

18:21.197 --> 18:24.134
<i>Are we considering these guys
armed and dangerous?</i>

18:24.234 --> 18:26.169
Well, not armed.

18:26.269 --> 18:29.806
If they had guns, they would've used them.
But dangerous? Very.

18:29.906 --> 18:31.808
<i>Now, what makes you think
they're dangerous?</i>

18:31.908 --> 18:35.393
Maybe they're just protectin' each other.

18:39.082 --> 18:42.552
Hey, look, I-I-I'm not sayin'
one way or the other.

18:42.652 --> 18:46.713
Just be careful and go
by the protocol on this.

18:46.823 --> 18:50.161
It's grunt police work
that's gonna bring this one in.

18:50.261 --> 18:52.997
These guys are miles away by now.

18:53.097 --> 18:56.333
<i>But if you wanna beat your head against
the wall, then here's what you're lookin' for.</i>

18:56.433 --> 18:58.702
<i>They're scared, like two little bunny rabbits.</i>

18:58.802 --> 19:00.572
Anything in a uniform or
flashing blue lights...

19:00.672 --> 19:01.672
is gonna spook 'em.

19:01.772 --> 19:05.743
<i>Okay? So the only thing we can do
is put a potato on a string...</i>

19:05.843 --> 19:07.745
<i>and drag it through South Boston.</i>

19:07.845 --> 19:10.370
Thanks for comin' out.

19:10.481 --> 19:14.136
You'd probably have
better luck with a beer.

19:14.585 --> 19:16.320
You would.

19:16.420 --> 19:19.253
<i>- Oh, fuck.
- Hey, Greenly.</i>

19:19.356 --> 19:22.382
<i>Onion bagel, cream cheese.</i>

19:34.706 --> 19:38.699
This conversation is going to be recorded.

19:38.810 --> 19:41.046
Just answer to the best of your knowledge.

19:41.146 --> 19:43.580
Excuse me, sir.
Please.

19:55.293 --> 19:57.761
<i>Okay, we're ready.</i>

19:59.364 --> 20:03.069
You boys are not under oath here.
Just answer the questions.

20:03.169 --> 20:05.399
I'm assuming...

20:05.504 --> 20:08.649
you knew these guys from before, huh?

20:10.843 --> 20:14.142
We met them last night.

20:14.247 --> 20:17.049
They had some
pretty interesting bandages.

20:17.149 --> 20:19.274
Know anything about that?

20:22.722 --> 20:25.124
Listen, if you want to fight,
you can see you're outnumbered here.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.160
We're trying to be civil,
so I suggest you take our offer.

20:27.260 --> 20:29.490
I make the offers.

20:29.595 --> 20:31.620
Hey, Boris.

20:33.833 --> 20:36.029
What would you do...

20:36.136 --> 20:38.229
if I told you...

20:38.338 --> 20:41.275
your pinko Commie mother
sucks so much dick...

20:41.375 --> 20:43.900
<i>her face looks like an egg?</i>

20:44.011 --> 20:46.731
- Fuck you!
- What are you doin'?

21:13.374 --> 21:16.604
Stay away!
He can take care of himself!

21:43.104 --> 21:45.841
Freeze,
you fuckin' Irish faggots!

21:45.941 --> 21:48.842
Get the fuck up!

21:48.944 --> 21:52.481
- Come on!
- Get your fuckin' hands off of me!

21:52.581 --> 21:55.784
Cuff yourself around the back!
Cuff yourself!

21:55.884 --> 21:58.375
Cuff it!

22:00.756 --> 22:03.292
You know why I fucking come here?

22:03.392 --> 22:05.656
I come here to kill you.

22:05.761 --> 22:09.891
But now, I no think I fucking kill you.

22:09.998 --> 22:11.900
I kill your brother.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
<i>Shoot him in the head.</i>

22:15.604 --> 22:17.604
- Fuck you!
- Gotta go.

22:17.706 --> 22:20.004
Conner!

22:20.109 --> 22:25.295
It was just a fuckin' bar fight!
You guys are fuckin' pussies!

23:17.601 --> 23:21.171
I hope your conscience is clear, Irishman.

24:33.513 --> 24:36.004
So, how is it...

24:36.115 --> 24:39.886
- that you guys are fluent in Russian?
- We paid attention in school.

24:39.986 --> 24:42.222
Do you speak any other languages?

24:42.322 --> 24:45.892
- Aye. Our mother insisted on it.
- French?

24:49.696 --> 24:51.696
Oh, that's beautiful.

24:55.702 --> 24:58.762
- What's that?
- It's Italian.

25:06.213 --> 25:08.213
<i>Jawohl.</i>

25:12.052 --> 25:17.058
What are you guys doin' workin'
at a friggin' meat packing plant?

25:17.158 --> 25:18.461
<i>- Uh, Agent Smecker?
The press is everywhere.</i>

25:18.561 --> 25:19.561
Yeah.

25:19.661 --> 25:23.698
They're just goin' nuts for these guys.
I don't know what you wanna do.

25:23.798 --> 25:26.468
You're not being charged.
It's up to you. You wanna talk to 'em?

25:26.568 --> 25:28.970
- Absolutely not.
- No pictures either.

25:29.070 --> 25:31.372
Is there any way that we could stay here?

25:31.472 --> 25:35.443
Uh, yeah. You know, we have
an extra holding cell you guys can...

25:35.543 --> 25:38.257
<i>- Can they stay?
- Well, we'll have...</i>

25:38.357 --> 25:40.388
<i>to check with your mom.</i>

25:40.648 --> 25:44.728
But it's okay with me
if your friends sleep over.

25:46.254 --> 25:48.814
Time to feed the dogs.

25:51.594 --> 25:53.858
Okay, people. Okay.

25:53.963 --> 25:56.932
This is our official statement.

25:57.032 --> 26:00.803
The MacManus brothers
are not being charged with a crime.

26:00.903 --> 26:03.439
<i>This is a clear-cut case of self-defense.</i>

26:03.539 --> 26:05.908
They are being released
at an undisclosed time and location...

26:06.008 --> 26:07.910
in accordance with their wishes.

26:08.010 --> 26:11.717
- Do the MacManus
brothers have any priors?

26:11.817 --> 26:14.300
Can we speak to the brothers?

26:17.920 --> 26:20.810
<i>- Hey, Rocco, how you doin'?
- Hey!</i>

26:21.957 --> 26:24.551
Yeah!

26:29.265 --> 26:31.167
What have you got there?

26:31.267 --> 26:33.997
- Ahh.
- Very nice.

26:37.574 --> 26:39.476
<i>This poor soul...</i>

26:39.576 --> 26:41.478
<i>cried out for help.</i>

26:41.578 --> 26:44.877
<i>They watched as he simply walked away.</i>

26:44.981 --> 26:47.677
<i>Indifference of good men!</i>

26:47.784 --> 26:50.685
<i>Nobody wanted to get involved.</i>

26:50.787 --> 26:52.322
<i>Nobody...</i>

26:52.422 --> 26:55.653
<i>Whosoever shed man's blood...</i>

26:55.759 --> 26:59.559
<i>by man shall his blood be shed.</i>

26:59.663 --> 27:04.101
<i>For in the image of God may deem a man.</i>

27:04.201 --> 27:06.137
Destroy all that which is evil.

27:06.237 --> 27:09.212
So that which is good may flourish.

27:43.642 --> 27:45.642
What the fuck is that?

27:47.479 --> 27:50.369
<i>It's that fuckin' Russian's pager.</i>

27:51.583 --> 27:53.583
Let's go.

28:04.796 --> 28:06.957
How are ya?

28:07.065 --> 28:09.401
- Keep the faith, man.
- Fuckin' blow me.

28:09.501 --> 28:12.972
- What was that? Have you got a pen?
- Yeah. Here you go.

28:13.072 --> 28:15.241
- Thanks. Be right back.
- Good morning, son. How are ya?

28:15.341 --> 28:19.931
- Good morning.
- We'd be honored if you would join us.

28:21.514 --> 28:24.745
- See this?
- What's this?

28:24.851 --> 28:26.851
Saints?

28:31.557 --> 28:34.107
Body of Christ.
Body of Christ.

28:51.445 --> 28:53.445
Amen.

28:58.252 --> 29:01.255
That's not funny, man.
Give it here, package boy.

29:01.355 --> 29:04.425
Joey Beevo said it was important.
Said to give it to him myself.

29:04.525 --> 29:07.358
Give me the fuckin' thing.

29:09.263 --> 29:11.458
Sit the fuck down.

29:22.977 --> 29:26.105
So, I'm Rocco.
I'm the funny man.

29:29.217 --> 29:31.119
I'm so fuckin' funny.

29:31.219 --> 29:33.983
- Fuck you, Vincenzo.
- Uh-huh.

29:34.088 --> 29:36.458
How did you get that shiner on your eye?

29:36.558 --> 29:41.573
What's the matter, someone
didn't think you were very funny?

29:43.131 --> 29:45.033
<i>I caught your show at
the Velvet Room at the Holiday Inn.</i>

29:45.133 --> 29:47.969
Loved it when you busted into
"Viva Las Vegas."

29:48.069 --> 29:50.697
Hey, hey, hey.

29:56.010 --> 29:58.878
You insignificant little fuck!

29:58.981 --> 30:03.077
<i>I always get my money,
you cocksucking bastardo!</i>

30:09.758 --> 30:11.660
<i>The '90s are killing me.</i>

30:11.760 --> 30:13.662
I shouldn't have done that.

30:13.762 --> 30:16.265
You're not supposed to tell a guy
you're gonna kill him no more.

30:16.365 --> 30:19.668
<i>I gotta tiptoe through the tulips
with these assholes.</i>

30:19.768 --> 30:23.101
Taking all the fun out of the job.

30:29.111 --> 30:31.832
Pappa Joe,
you want me to go now?

30:33.717 --> 30:36.853
All the boys tell me how you
make them laugh when you come around.

30:36.953 --> 30:39.790
What a crackup you are.
What do they call you?

30:39.890 --> 30:41.983
Uh, the-

30:42.092 --> 30:44.560
The-The funny man.

30:44.661 --> 30:46.563
<i>The funny man.</i>

30:46.663 --> 30:50.064
I'm having a shitty day.
I'm depressed.

30:50.166 --> 30:52.964
Tell me a funny joke.

30:53.069 --> 30:55.560
Now?

30:55.672 --> 30:57.641
A joke? Uh-

30:57.741 --> 31:00.110
<i>Um, uh, a joke.
Yeah, all right.</i>

31:00.210 --> 31:03.737
Um, there's these, uh,
three guys...

31:03.847 --> 31:06.042
a-a-a spic...

31:06.149 --> 31:09.085
a-a-a white guy and a black guy.

31:09.186 --> 31:11.711
- Nigger!
- Yeah.

31:11.822 --> 31:14.158
N-N-Yeah.
And they're walkin' along the beach.

31:14.258 --> 31:17.061
They see this pot.
They rub it, a genie comes out.

31:17.161 --> 31:19.970
<i>Genie says you can wish
for anything you want.</i>

31:20.070 --> 31:22.133
<i>He asks the Mexican what he wants.</i>

31:22.233 --> 31:24.135
And he goes...

31:24.235 --> 31:29.140
"I want all my people in America
to be happy and free in Mexico."

31:29.240 --> 31:33.643
So the genie- Poof!
And all the spics are in Mexico.

31:33.744 --> 31:36.147
- And then he asks the black guy-
- Nigger.

31:36.247 --> 31:38.613
Yeah, that's what I said.

31:38.716 --> 31:41.420
He goes to the nigger,
says, "What do you want?"

31:41.520 --> 31:43.422
And he goes...

31:43.522 --> 31:46.355
"I want all my African...

31:46.458 --> 31:48.227
"my nigger brothers in America...

31:48.327 --> 31:52.320
to be back in Africa
and happy and everything."

31:52.431 --> 31:54.490
So the genie goes poof!

31:54.599 --> 31:57.135
<i>And, um, all the niggers in America...</i>

31:57.235 --> 31:59.829
<i>are in Africa.</i>

31:59.938 --> 32:02.207
And this is goin'- I'm not funny today.

32:02.307 --> 32:05.210
I know. I'm havin' a hard day.
I-I-This joke sucks.

32:05.310 --> 32:07.676
<i>It's just a stupid joke.</i>

32:11.850 --> 32:13.850
Continue the joke.

32:18.291 --> 32:21.427
So the genie says to the white guy...

32:21.527 --> 32:23.620
"What's your one wish?"

32:23.730 --> 32:25.765
And the white guy goes,
"You mean to tell me...

32:25.865 --> 32:28.067
all the niggers and spics
are out of America?"

32:28.167 --> 32:30.203
The genie goes, "Yeah." He says...

32:30.303 --> 32:33.193
"Well, um, I'll have a Coke then."

32:55.095 --> 32:56.997
"I'll have a Coke."

32:57.097 --> 32:59.327
Yeah. Everybody's out...

32:59.433 --> 33:03.768
so he just wants a Coke,
'cause that's all he needs.

33:06.373 --> 33:09.774
- Tell me one more.
- What?

33:28.196 --> 33:30.196
Knock yourselves out.

33:54.255 --> 33:56.255
Fuckin' hell.

34:11.139 --> 34:13.543
- Do you know what we
need, man? Some rope.

34:13.643 --> 34:14.643
<i>Absolutely.</i>

34:14.743 --> 34:17.679
<i>- What are ya, insane?
- No, it ain't.</i>

34:17.780 --> 34:19.982
Charlie Bronson's always got rope.

34:20.081 --> 34:22.641
<i>- What?
- Yeah.</i>

34:22.751 --> 34:24.023
He's got a lot of rope strapped around him...

34:24.123 --> 34:25.454
in the movies, and they
always end up using it.

34:25.554 --> 34:29.391
<i>- You've lost it, haven't it?
- No, I'm serious.</i>

34:29.492 --> 34:32.328
That's stupid. Name one thing
you'd need a rope for.

34:32.428 --> 34:36.331
You don't fuckin' know what you're gonna
need it for. They just always need it.

34:36.431 --> 34:40.088
What's this "they" shit?
This isn't a movie.

34:43.373 --> 34:45.500
<i>Oh. Right.</i>

34:51.648 --> 34:53.648
Is that right, Rambo?

34:57.554 --> 35:00.955
All right.
Get your stupid fuckin' rope.

35:01.057 --> 35:03.525
I'll get my stupid rope.

35:03.627 --> 35:05.627
I'll get it.

35:06.897 --> 35:09.022
There's rope right there.

35:43.201 --> 35:45.201
You nervous?

35:46.437 --> 35:49.669
- A bit.
- Myself as well.

36:02.154 --> 36:04.154
Hello?

36:06.992 --> 36:08.992
Uh-huh. Room number?

36:10.329 --> 36:12.709
Have we got a time of death?

36:15.167 --> 36:17.167
We got a body count?

36:20.005 --> 36:22.775
Uh-huh. I'll be down there in a bit.

36:22.875 --> 36:26.003
Keep the press out.

36:26.112 --> 36:28.915
- What are you doin'?
- I just wanted to cuddle.

36:29.015 --> 36:31.609
Cuddle?
What a fag.

36:42.829 --> 36:44.731
Ooh.

36:44.831 --> 36:47.636
<i>This is a fucking slaughterhouse.</i>

36:56.276 --> 37:00.179
- How many bodies, Greenly?
- Eight.

37:00.281 --> 37:03.617
Aw, shit. I forgot about that one.
Nine. Nine?

37:03.717 --> 37:06.654
While Greenly's out gettin' coffee,
anybody else want anything?

37:06.754 --> 37:09.348
Shit!

37:09.456 --> 37:11.651
<i>So, Duffy...</i>

37:11.759 --> 37:15.593
you got any theories to go with that tie?

37:17.264 --> 37:20.927
Look, fuck all these other guys.

37:21.035 --> 37:23.370
This was their target- the fag man.

37:23.470 --> 37:25.870
The what man?

37:25.973 --> 37:29.101
The fat man.

37:29.209 --> 37:31.370
Well, Freud was right.

37:31.478 --> 37:35.381
So you think they came
for the fag man, huh?

37:35.483 --> 37:37.951
<i>What do you base this upon?</i>

37:38.053 --> 37:40.722
He was the only one done right.
Double tap back of the head.

37:40.822 --> 37:43.358
<i>- And the pennies?
- New hit man wants to leave his mark.</i>

37:43.458 --> 37:45.393
That's a possibility.

37:45.493 --> 37:49.452
<i>Now you Irish cops are perkin' up.</i>

37:49.564 --> 37:51.466
That's two sound theories in one day...

37:51.566 --> 37:54.502
neither of which deal
with abnormally-sized men.

37:54.602 --> 37:58.002
Kind of makes me feel like Riverdancing.

38:01.810 --> 38:05.847
<i>Another possibility is they were
placed there with religious intent.</i>

38:05.947 --> 38:09.919
<i>Okay, some cultures still put pennies
in the eyes of the dead. Or silver.</i>

38:10.019 --> 38:12.487
The Italians, the Greeks.

38:12.588 --> 38:15.022
<i>Sicilians.</i>

38:15.124 --> 38:18.150
So, what's the "symbology" there?

38:18.260 --> 38:20.990
The "symbology"?

38:21.097 --> 38:24.433
Now that Duffy has relinquished
his King Bonehead crown...

38:24.533 --> 38:26.435
I see we have an heir to the thrown.

38:26.535 --> 38:32.008
<i>I'm sure the word you were looking for was
"symbolism." What is the symbolism there.</i>

38:32.108 --> 38:34.872
Let me explain it to you.

38:34.977 --> 38:37.213
In Greek and Roman mythology...

38:37.313 --> 38:41.050
when you died, you'd have
to pay the toll to Charon...

38:41.150 --> 38:44.554
the boatman who ferried you
across to the Gates of Judgment.

38:44.654 --> 38:47.291
This made sure the dead came to
atone for what they did during their lives...

38:47.391 --> 38:49.293
Detective Alapopskalius.

38:49.393 --> 38:51.662
Jesus. You're the first one
that ever got that.

38:51.762 --> 38:55.721
Yeah, well, I'm an expert in nameology.

38:59.703 --> 39:03.528
These burns indicate
that they used silencers.

39:03.807 --> 39:06.643
Look at these entry and exit wounds.

39:06.743 --> 39:08.868
They're almost identical.

39:10.380 --> 39:13.550
The two bullets went in here
through the top of the skull...

39:13.650 --> 39:16.486
crisscrossed, and exited
through the eyeballs.

39:16.586 --> 39:19.424
This one clue tells us three distinct facts.

39:19.524 --> 39:22.727
- Number one. Duffy?
- They shot him at a downward angle.

39:22.827 --> 39:28.060
- They put him on his knees?
- Excellent. Number two. Greenly.

39:28.166 --> 39:31.397
They shot him at a downward angle?

39:35.406 --> 39:38.381
It tells us he was the last to die.

39:39.577 --> 39:41.512
And number three. Dolly.

39:41.612 --> 39:43.514
There was two shooters.

39:43.614 --> 39:46.250
- Fan-freakin'-tastic.
- Hey, wait a minute.

39:46.350 --> 39:48.853
Stay with me, boys.
What did they do...

39:48.953 --> 39:50.855
to make two such identical wounds?

39:50.955 --> 39:53.959
Two men of similar height
dropped this guy down.

39:54.059 --> 39:58.430
Each puts some iron to his head
and boom! That's all she frickin' wrote.

39:58.530 --> 40:01.533
- What about one guy, two guns?
- Ah, possible.

40:01.633 --> 40:04.236
But unlikely.
The angles are too extreme.

40:04.336 --> 40:05.872
A guy holding two guns to the back of...

40:05.972 --> 40:07.706
your noodle is going to
shoot straight ahead.

40:07.806 --> 40:09.708
He wouldn't cock out his elbows.
It makes no sense.

40:09.808 --> 40:14.074
Besides, are you telling me
one guy came in here...

40:14.179 --> 40:18.117
and killed eight men with eight extremely
well-aimed shots in just a few seconds?

40:18.217 --> 40:21.022
No way.
It had to be at least two.

40:25.657 --> 40:27.868
You and your fuckin' rope.

40:39.339 --> 40:44.609
- I told you there would be a shaft.
- Just like on television.

41:06.600 --> 41:08.600
Fuck.

41:35.362 --> 41:37.831
Where the fuck are you goin'?

41:37.933 --> 41:40.702
Shh! I fuckin' hear some shit out here.

41:40.802 --> 41:44.639
Fuck you. I'm sweatin' my ass off
draggin' your fuckin' rope around.

41:44.739 --> 41:46.908
- It must weigh 30 pounds.
- Shh!

41:47.008 --> 41:49.878
We are doin' some serious shit here.
Now, get a fuckin' hold of yourself!

41:49.978 --> 41:53.181
Oh, fuck you! I'm not the rope-totin'
Charlie Bronson wannabe...

41:53.281 --> 41:58.466
- that's gettin' us fuckin' lost.
- Would you fuckin' shut it?

41:58.587 --> 42:00.587
You mother...

42:11.666 --> 42:15.831
- Jesus fuckin' Christ.
- Oh, shit!

42:43.532 --> 42:46.602
Shepherds we shall be
for Thee, my Lord, for Thee.

42:46.702 --> 42:48.805
Power hath descended forth
from Thy hand.

42:48.905 --> 42:51.341
Our feet may swiftly
carry out Thy command.

42:51.441 --> 42:58.156
So we shall flow a river forth to Thee,
and teeming with souls shall it ever be.

43:35.687 --> 43:40.021
<i>And I shall count thee
among my favored sheep.</i>

43:40.124 --> 43:45.309
<i>And you shall have the protection
of all the angels in heaven.</i>

43:46.898 --> 43:48.898
Television.

43:50.835 --> 43:53.037
Television is the explanation for this.

43:53.137 --> 43:56.903
You see this in bad television.

43:57.008 --> 44:00.412
The little assault guys creepin' through
the vents, comin' in through the ceiling.

44:00.512 --> 44:06.218
That James Bond shit never happens
in real life. Professionals don't do that.

44:06.318 --> 44:11.590
Well, name one thing you're gonna need
this stupid fuckin' rope for.

44:11.690 --> 44:14.560
- That was way easier than I thought.
- Aye.

44:14.660 --> 44:17.162
On TV, you've always got that guy
that jumps over the sofa.

44:17.262 --> 44:20.262
And then you've gotta shoot him
for ten fuckin' minutes too.

44:20.632 --> 44:24.898
- Christ. We're good.
- Yes, we are.

44:25.003 --> 44:29.338
Now, what do you think
is in that little case there?

44:35.014 --> 44:38.074
- Fuck me!
- Oh.

44:38.184 --> 44:40.253
The hits just keep on comin'.

44:40.353 --> 44:42.617
Ow! Give it a smell.

44:42.722 --> 44:45.088
I love our new job.

45:03.042 --> 45:05.945
<i>Bastard.
This has got to be his big break.</i>

45:06.045 --> 45:11.416
- Yeah.
- We've got to fuck with him, right?

45:11.519 --> 45:13.421
Okay.

45:13.521 --> 45:15.423
Shh.

45:15.523 --> 45:18.693
Open the door.
I'm gonna grab him by the fuckin' hair.

45:18.793 --> 45:21.261
Sit down!

45:21.362 --> 45:24.165
- Get down! Shut up!
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

45:24.265 --> 45:27.405
We're on the same side.
Please, don't shoot.

45:27.505 --> 45:28.703
Get on the ground!

45:28.803 --> 45:30.871
Don't shoot, don't shoot.
We're on the same side.

45:30.971 --> 45:33.407
Boss must've sent me
in as backup. I'm Rocco!

45:33.507 --> 45:36.343
- I'm the funny man. That ain't my name.
- Where's your gun?

45:36.443 --> 45:39.046
- Where's your gun?
- I'm the fuckin' funny man!

45:39.146 --> 45:40.514
It's right here. Right here.

45:40.614 --> 45:43.482
That ain't my real name.

45:43.585 --> 45:47.077
<i>What the fuck? Jeez!</i>

45:47.189 --> 45:49.953
It's a fuckin' six-shooter!

45:50.058 --> 45:53.425
There's nine bodies, genius!

45:53.528 --> 45:58.433
<i>What the fuck were you gonna do,
laugh the last three to death, funny man?</i>

45:58.533 --> 46:02.358
<i>Pappa Joe said there was only two!
In and out!</i>

46:03.605 --> 46:06.374
Boy, you guys sure did a good job.

46:06.474 --> 46:09.077
Ah, shit.
You guys are good, huh?

46:09.177 --> 46:11.079
Cool masks.
Where'd you get 'em?

46:11.179 --> 46:14.616
- We gotta do him right here!
- Right now!

46:14.716 --> 46:17.152
- Don't, please! I'm the funny man!
- Right.

46:17.252 --> 46:19.188
- Don't kill me! Don't kill me, please!
- Right!

46:19.288 --> 46:21.288
<i>I'm the funny man!</i>

46:29.365 --> 46:31.365
<i>What a fuckin' idiot!</i>

46:36.005 --> 46:40.271
Fuckin'-What the fuckin' fuck-
Who the fuck-

46:40.376 --> 46:45.678
<i>Fuck this fuckin'-
How did you two fuckin' fucks- Fuck!</i>

46:45.781 --> 46:50.711
Well, that certainly illustrates
the diversity of the word.

46:53.423 --> 46:56.722
All these guys are Russian mob.

46:56.827 --> 46:59.763
But not like those two peons
in the alley the other day.

46:59.863 --> 47:02.766
These guys are all syndicate
bosses and underbosses.

47:02.866 --> 47:06.521
I have a dossier on every man in this room.

47:07.204 --> 47:10.073
Since the Iron Curtain has gone down...

47:10.173 --> 47:12.876
the Russian syndicates
have started to come here.

47:12.976 --> 47:17.181
And in the spirit of Glasnost, the Soviets
have opened their borders to the Mafia.

47:17.281 --> 47:20.250
But the Italians,
they aren't convinced...

47:20.350 --> 47:23.654
the grounds in Mother Russia are
fertile enough for organized crime yet.

47:23.754 --> 47:29.093
So they ain't ready to commit.
But the Russians are coming here anyway.

47:29.193 --> 47:31.684
They are unwelcome.

47:31.796 --> 47:35.562
So, what we have here,
gentlemen...

47:35.667 --> 47:38.465
is possibly the beginning...

47:38.569 --> 47:41.544
of the first international mob war.

47:42.407 --> 47:45.443
Unless I've totally missed something.

47:45.543 --> 47:47.946
<i>I'm live from the Copley Plaza Hotel...</i>

47:48.046 --> 47:50.582
where we have just been informed
that the largest multiple murder...

47:50.682 --> 47:52.984
in Boston's history has just taken place.

47:53.084 --> 47:55.186
We have learned that
there were nine victims...

47:55.286 --> 47:58.656
all deeply involved in a notoriously
violent Russian crime syndicate...

47:58.756 --> 48:00.658
right here in Boston.

48:00.758 --> 48:03.353
<i>Anybody you think is evil?</i>

48:03.462 --> 48:05.657
Aye.

48:05.764 --> 48:09.335
Don't you think
that's a little weird, a little psycho?

48:09.435 --> 48:12.835
Do you know what I think is psycho, Roc?

48:15.708 --> 48:17.843
It's decent men with loving families.

48:17.943 --> 48:20.813
They go home every day after work,
and they turn on the news.

48:20.913 --> 48:23.515
You know what they see?
They see rapists...

48:23.615 --> 48:25.718
and murderers and child molesters.

48:25.818 --> 48:27.720
They're all gettin' out of prison.

48:27.820 --> 48:30.789
<i>Mafiosos...</i>

48:30.889 --> 48:33.058
gettin' caught with 20 kilos...

48:33.158 --> 48:36.195
gettin' out on bail the same fuckin' day.

48:36.295 --> 48:39.866
And everywhere,
everyone thinks the same thing...

48:39.966 --> 48:44.037
that someone should just
go kill those motherfuckers.

48:44.137 --> 48:47.800
Kill 'em all.
Admit it.

48:47.907 --> 48:50.372
Even you've thought about it.

48:53.546 --> 48:56.861
You guys should be in every major city.

48:57.183 --> 48:59.219
<i>This is some heavy shit.</i>

48:59.319 --> 49:02.549
This is like "Lone Ranger" heavy, man.

49:03.189 --> 49:07.269
Fuck it! There's so much shit
that pisses me off!

49:08.828 --> 49:11.698
You guys should recruit, 'cause
I'm sick and fuckin' tired...

49:11.798 --> 49:15.102
of walkin' down the street
waitin' for one of these crack-pipin'...

49:15.202 --> 49:18.572
ass-wipin', motherless lowlifes to get me!

49:18.672 --> 49:20.867
Hallelujah, Jaffar.

49:20.975 --> 49:22.877
So you're not just talkin'
about mob guys, right?

49:22.977 --> 49:25.613
You're talkin' about pimps and drug dealers
and all that shit, right?

49:25.713 --> 49:27.713
Oh, yeah.

49:29.483 --> 49:32.753
Fuck. You guys could
do this every goddamn day.

49:32.853 --> 49:35.549
We're sort of like 7-Eleven.

49:35.656 --> 49:39.126
We're not always doin' business,
but we're always open.

49:39.226 --> 49:43.306
- Mmm. That is nicely put.
- Thank you very much.

49:52.707 --> 49:54.832
I will fuck you up, dude.

50:01.783 --> 50:06.628
So then we go right through
the fuckin' ceiling like this-

50:13.295 --> 50:18.597
Oh, boy. You fuckin' guys.
You ruined me.

50:18.700 --> 50:21.362
I'm fuckin' done.

50:21.470 --> 50:24.565
Permanent fuckin' package boy.

50:24.674 --> 50:28.678
Who said that?
You can take credit on that, you know?

50:28.778 --> 50:31.076
What, are you serious?

50:31.180 --> 50:33.180
Yeah. Fuck it.

50:34.784 --> 50:37.487
If you think about it,
it's all you can do, really.

50:37.587 --> 50:39.622
<i>I mean, you can't go in there
and tell him it was us.</i>

50:39.722 --> 50:41.691
<i>Climb the corporate ladder, boy.</i>

50:41.791 --> 50:44.760
Don Rocco.

50:44.861 --> 50:47.091
Fuck it.

50:47.196 --> 50:49.098
I'm doin' it. I deserve it.

50:49.198 --> 50:52.201
I've been workin' for those fat bastards
since I've been in high school.

50:52.301 --> 50:55.371
Look at this fuckin' place.
They're fuckin' me, man.

50:55.471 --> 50:59.636
They can suck my pathetic little dick!

50:59.743 --> 51:02.246
And I'll dip my nuts in marinara sauce...

51:02.346 --> 51:05.015
just so the fat bastards can get
a taste of home while they're at it.

51:05.115 --> 51:08.482
<i>Fuck it!
I'm doin' it.</i>

51:08.585 --> 51:11.281
It is done!
Shit!

51:11.388 --> 51:14.653
- Shit! Shit!
- Oh, my God!

51:17.861 --> 51:19.897
- What the fuck!
- I'm hit!

51:19.997 --> 51:21.899
Oh, fuck!

51:21.999 --> 51:24.229
<i>What the fuck!</i>

51:26.637 --> 51:29.706
I can't believe that just fuckin' happened!

51:29.806 --> 51:32.016
- Is it dead?
- Oh, my God!

51:54.632 --> 51:56.668
Donna's gonna be angry about her cat.

51:56.768 --> 51:59.293
Shit.

51:59.404 --> 52:01.773
She's on every drug known to man.

52:01.873 --> 52:06.208
She'd have sold the thing
for a dime bag. Screw her.

52:08.414 --> 52:10.783
I do kind of feel like an asshole, though.

52:10.883 --> 52:13.219
Yeah, Roc, you sound
real remorseful there.

52:13.319 --> 52:16.549
She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.

52:17.957 --> 52:20.292
Listen, something's been
botherin' me about last night.

52:20.392 --> 52:23.190
<i>What?</i>

52:23.295 --> 52:26.132
What if your boss knew how many fellows
were supposed to be there?

52:26.232 --> 52:29.268
<i>- What are you-What are you sayin'?
- Think about it.</i>

52:29.368 --> 52:31.632
Nine men, six bullets.

52:31.737 --> 52:34.907
Think they sold me out?
No way. No way.

52:35.007 --> 52:37.276
Listen, he probably knew
you'd end up nailin' the fat guy...

52:37.376 --> 52:39.445
maybe one or two more, but he had
to know you weren't walkin' out of there.

52:39.545 --> 52:41.947
Figure it out.
The shooter's dead at the scene.

52:42.047 --> 52:43.950
There's no in-depth investigation.

52:44.050 --> 52:46.419
They'll just slide right off his fuckin' back.

52:46.519 --> 52:48.421
'Cause what the fuck?

52:48.521 --> 52:51.892
As much as I love you, man,
you are not exactly Don Corleone.

52:51.992 --> 52:53.894
No, no, that-

52:53.994 --> 52:56.163
That's just not the way things are done.
Besides, how does he know...

52:56.263 --> 52:57.919
I just don't get in there,
see there's too many...

52:58.019 --> 52:59.232
of 'em, serve 'em their fuckin' food-

52:59.332 --> 53:01.301
Because he fuckin' knows you, Roc!

53:01.401 --> 53:04.771
A smooth hitter would have gone in there,
seen it was a fuckin' wash and slipped out.

53:04.871 --> 53:07.007
But you, he knows this is your only shot.

53:07.107 --> 53:10.252
You've been waitin' 18 fuckin' years.

53:10.844 --> 53:12.679
<i>No. No, no.
That-That-</i>

53:12.779 --> 53:15.782
That just ain't the way-
No, that's bull-That's bullshit.

53:15.882 --> 53:18.920
You don't know what you're talkin' about.
That's just not the way things happen.

53:19.020 --> 53:22.123
I mean, thanks for your concern and all,
but that just ain't the thing of it.

53:22.223 --> 53:24.625
Do me a favor, all right?
Just roll it around a bit on your way in.

53:24.725 --> 53:26.627
- Will you for me?
- No. No rollin'.

53:26.727 --> 53:30.094
Nothin' needs to be rolled.
Fuck!

53:30.197 --> 53:31.847
Where the fuck are you goin'?
Did you tell him?

53:31.947 --> 53:32.867
Of course I fuckin' told him.

53:32.967 --> 53:36.370
- Then what the fuck?
- You guys don't know that shit for sure!

53:36.470 --> 53:38.372
Oh, you're such a fuckin' retard!

53:38.472 --> 53:41.842
- Hey, fuck you!
- Oh, man, use your fuckin' brain for once!

53:41.942 --> 53:45.146
Is it so unbelievable that
they don't fuckin' care about ya?

53:45.246 --> 53:47.648
Oh, yeah, you two fuckin' micks
know what's goin' on, huh?

53:47.748 --> 53:50.986
<i>- Fuck you both!
- This is not a fuckin' thing you...</i>

53:51.086 --> 53:52.987
should gamble on, all right?

53:53.087 --> 53:55.190
I'm the fuck out of here.

53:55.290 --> 53:57.192
Fine! Fuck it!

53:57.292 --> 54:00.028
What kind of flowers you want
at your funeral, you dumb wop?

54:00.128 --> 54:02.397
<i>- It's the last time I'm gonna see ya!
- I'll be back at nine!</i>

54:02.497 --> 54:05.867
- Bury the fuckin' cat!
- Listen, you get in there...

54:05.967 --> 54:11.067
and you start gettin' a bad vibe,
you get the fuck out quick!

54:16.678 --> 54:18.703
Hello?

54:18.814 --> 54:21.783
- Murph.
- Hey, Roc. You okay?

54:21.883 --> 54:24.716
Anybody call for me?

54:24.820 --> 54:26.989
No, man.
Are you sure you're okay?

54:27.089 --> 54:29.285
I'm fuckin' fine.

54:29.392 --> 54:32.112
I'll catch you on the flip side.

54:39.969 --> 54:42.870
<i>Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.</i>

54:59.689 --> 55:02.692
<i>Pack your shit! Pack your shit!
We gotta get out of here!</i>

55:02.792 --> 55:05.796
- We gotta get out!
- What the fuck are you talkin' about?

55:05.896 --> 55:08.299
I killed them!
Oh, Jesus, I killed them all!

55:08.399 --> 55:10.634
- Just calm down. Tell us what happened.
- No!

55:10.734 --> 55:12.964
<i>- Rocco!
- Calm down, man.</i>

55:13.070 --> 55:16.540
Fuck you!
You start gettin' excited, motherfucker!

55:16.640 --> 55:19.108
<i>- We gotta go!
- Rocco!</i>

55:21.111 --> 55:25.871
- Well, how many were there?
- Fuckin' hurry the fuck up!

55:26.083 --> 55:28.118
All right!
I love this shit!

55:28.218 --> 55:32.089
<i>- What the fuck is wrong with you, Roc?
- The cocksucker sold me out!</i>

55:32.189 --> 55:34.325
Didn't I tell you, Roc?
Did they pull on you first?

55:34.425 --> 55:37.061
What am I doin'?
In the middle of the Lakeview!

55:37.161 --> 55:39.064
Lakeview the deli, Roc?

55:39.164 --> 55:42.467
- Looks like we got us a new fuckin' recruit.
- Rocco!

55:42.567 --> 55:46.594
- What?
- Where's my cat?

55:48.506 --> 55:51.942
I killed your cat,
you druggie bitch.

55:52.043 --> 55:53.478
- God. Why?
- What?

55:53.578 --> 55:56.247
I felt it would bring
closure to our relationship.

55:56.347 --> 55:59.282
- You killed my-my-
- Your what?

55:59.384 --> 56:00.384
My-

56:00.484 --> 56:03.688
Your fuckin' what? Huh? Your what, bitch?

56:03.788 --> 56:06.491
I'll shoot myself in the head...

56:06.591 --> 56:09.583
if you can tell me that cat's name!

56:09.694 --> 56:12.030
Go ahead! Your what?
Your precious little...

56:12.130 --> 56:16.469
- Skippy. Skippy.
- Oh, Jesus. What color was it, bitch?

56:16.569 --> 56:18.771
Don't you fuckin'
yell at her like that, you prick!

56:18.871 --> 56:21.601
Shut your fat ass, Rayvie!

56:21.707 --> 56:26.612
I can't buy a pack of smokes without
runnin' into nine guys you fucked!

56:26.712 --> 56:30.341
Damn! Son of a bitch.

56:30.449 --> 56:32.449
<i>Let's go!</i>

56:32.551 --> 56:34.520
Let's get the fuck outta here!

56:34.620 --> 56:37.656
Those rat fucks! All of them
were all laughin' at me, man.

56:37.756 --> 56:40.126
- Are you sure you killed them, Roc?
- Fuckin'-A right I did.

56:40.226 --> 56:42.395
I had a goddamn turkey shoot over there.

56:42.495 --> 56:46.165
- Anybody call for me?
- No, man. Are you sure you're okay?

56:46.265 --> 56:48.265
I'm fuckin' fine.

56:50.036 --> 56:52.834
I'll catch you on the flip side.

57:31.112 --> 57:33.945
I'll bet it was a fuckin' test.

57:34.048 --> 57:39.658
Vincenzo came in here shootin'
his mouth off. He made sure we knew.

57:42.657 --> 57:45.326
But we did what
we were supposed to, huh?

57:45.426 --> 57:47.917
We kept our mouths shut.

57:48.029 --> 57:51.624
You? You did your part.

57:53.734 --> 57:55.636
Fuck!

57:55.736 --> 57:58.432
They know we're goodfellas now.

57:58.539 --> 58:00.442
We'll get taken care of, baby.

58:00.542 --> 58:02.635
What? Did everyone know?

58:02.744 --> 58:06.215
<i>Next thing you're gonna tell me
Sal was in on it.</i>

58:06.315 --> 58:10.919
Vincenzo told Sal first.
That fat fuck knew before we did.

58:11.019 --> 58:14.419
At least we got our funny man back, huh?

58:26.134 --> 58:28.917
That was funny, wasn't it?
That was real fucking funny!

58:29.017 --> 58:29.972
No, not me! Not me!

58:30.072 --> 58:32.973
Huh? Ha! Funny! Funny!

58:33.075 --> 58:36.011
Funny! Funny! Funny!

58:36.112 --> 58:38.171
Funny!

58:42.385 --> 58:46.048
Listen, Roc, did anybody see ya?

58:46.155 --> 58:49.726
Fuck, man, I might as well
have gone around postin' flyers.

58:49.826 --> 58:53.523
Right out in public, man.

58:53.630 --> 58:55.565
Liberating, isn't it?

58:55.665 --> 58:59.320
- Let's fucking go!
- You know, it is a bit.

59:01.804 --> 59:05.799
<i>Conner, stop the car!
Stop the fucking car, man!</i>

59:06.376 --> 59:09.513
Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker,
Yakavetta's right hand!

59:09.613 --> 59:11.524
He's the one who set me up, then he went...

59:11.624 --> 59:13.717
around telling everybody
I was as good as dead.

59:13.817 --> 59:15.542
Goes there every Wednesday night 10:00,

59:15.642 --> 59:17.821
jerks off on the same
titty dancer. Never misses.

59:17.921 --> 59:21.358
- Yeah, so?
- So? So let's kill the motherfucker!

59:21.458 --> 59:24.161
I mean, what are you guys?
That's your new thing, right?

59:24.261 --> 59:26.830
- Yeah, well-
- Ah, what the fuck!

59:26.930 --> 59:29.133
I mean, who makes the cut?
Is there a raffle or something?

59:29.233 --> 59:33.137
To tell you the truth, those first ones,
they just sort of fell onto our laps.

59:33.237 --> 59:35.139
Well, what do you do?

59:35.239 --> 59:40.010
We haven't really got a system
of decidin' who, Roc. It's-

59:40.110 --> 59:42.874
Me! Me! I'm the guy!

59:42.980 --> 59:46.651
<i>I know everyone, their habits,
who they hang out with, who they talk to!</i>

59:46.751 --> 59:49.654
I got phone numbers, addresses!
I know who they're fuckin'!

59:49.754 --> 59:51.847
I know where they live!

59:51.956 --> 59:53.956
We could kill everyone.

59:55.694 --> 59:57.694
So what do you think?

01:00:00.432 --> 01:00:03.322
I'm strangely comfortable with it.

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:18.374
That's him.

01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:40.598
Okay, Roc.

01:00:43.075 --> 01:00:45.111
What? You guys got masks.

01:00:45.211 --> 01:00:47.880
You look like Mush Mouth from Fat Albert.

01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:51.117
Fine. Fuck it!
When we're through, she can I.D. Me.

01:00:51.217 --> 01:00:54.554
I don't care. Just trying
to be professional, but no!

01:00:54.654 --> 01:00:57.157
- It looks fine.
- No, fuck it.

01:00:57.257 --> 01:01:03.632
No, shut the fuck up! You look good.
Put it on. You look fucking scary, man.

01:01:05.499 --> 01:01:09.629
Now, Roc, are you sure
that you're "O-B-kay-B"?

01:01:23.416 --> 01:01:26.586
She was in here when it all went down.

01:01:26.686 --> 01:01:29.554
- Can she I.D.'em?
- No.

01:01:29.657 --> 01:01:32.026
- There were wearin' masks.
- Of course they were.

01:01:32.126 --> 01:01:34.395
You scream, you're dead!
Which one's he in?

01:01:34.495 --> 01:01:39.100
And don't make like you don't know
who the fuck I'm talkin' about!

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:42.970
Don't you talk to me like that,
you dirty little girl.

01:01:43.070 --> 01:01:44.972
Oh, yeah. Give it to Daddy.

01:01:45.072 --> 01:01:48.599
Oh, this is one sick motherfucker.

01:01:48.709 --> 01:01:51.041
- How many?
- Three.

01:01:51.145 --> 01:01:53.047
Two of them did the shootin'.

01:01:53.147 --> 01:01:56.972
<i>"...and teeming with souls shall it ever be."</i>

01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:03.958
Our little theory from last night
just got shot to shit.

01:02:04.058 --> 01:02:06.694
Something new is going on here.

01:02:14.837 --> 01:02:17.106
After talking to the dancer...

01:02:17.206 --> 01:02:21.143
we know their mark
was the guy in the middle booth.

01:02:21.243 --> 01:02:25.238
After she watches 'em whack him,
she passes out.

01:02:47.036 --> 01:02:49.038
What the fuck are you doing?

01:02:49.138 --> 01:02:51.107
I'll tip her!

01:02:51.207 --> 01:02:53.543
Why are there two extra victims?

01:02:53.643 --> 01:02:57.213
- Witnesses.
- No way they could have seen.

01:03:00.617 --> 01:03:04.553
Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen...

01:03:04.654 --> 01:03:06.556
<i>to the protocol of the porno industry...</i>

01:03:06.656 --> 01:03:11.294
<i>as I'm sure you've never been
in one of these places before.</i>

01:03:11.394 --> 01:03:14.999
A man goes into the booth,
puts the money through the slot...

01:03:15.099 --> 01:03:17.034
the dancer gets it on the other side.

01:03:17.134 --> 01:03:19.036
She hits the button,
the door goes up.

01:03:19.136 --> 01:03:23.474
Now there's only glass between you,
and that's "little fireman" time.

01:03:23.574 --> 01:03:25.743
No way they could have seen it.

01:03:25.843 --> 01:03:29.335
Those doors were down,
so that means this:

01:03:29.446 --> 01:03:31.782
They looked in,
down through the peepholes...

01:03:31.882 --> 01:03:35.820
saw these guys, opened the doors
from the inside...

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:38.322
pop, pop, pop,
right through the glass.

01:03:38.422 --> 01:03:40.422
Why?

01:03:48.832 --> 01:03:51.528
- It's like a scumbag yard sale.
- We should come down here...

01:03:51.628 --> 01:03:52.971
once a week and clean house.

01:03:53.071 --> 01:03:56.641
Maybe the three guys
had something in common.

01:03:56.741 --> 01:04:00.212
No, this guy's big-time.
These two are street-walkin' scum.

01:04:00.312 --> 01:04:03.048
Then that's what they had in common-
they're all bad guys.

01:04:03.148 --> 01:04:06.481
Now they're all dead bad guys.

01:04:06.584 --> 01:04:08.753
Oh, man, you gotta let me do these guys.

01:04:08.853 --> 01:04:11.189
I'm such a moron.
I gotta make up for that tit thing.

01:04:11.289 --> 01:04:13.693
- There's no way. I've been
waitin' for this asshole.

01:04:13.793 --> 01:04:14.793
Oh, come on.

01:04:14.893 --> 01:04:17.987
Come on, man.
Give the guy his shot.

01:04:18.096 --> 01:04:22.294
It's the real deal, Roc.
Evil men, dead men.

01:04:25.137 --> 01:04:27.039
Good shooting...

01:04:27.139 --> 01:04:29.139
shitty shooting.

01:04:41.654 --> 01:04:44.487
Plus... we got us a genuine...

01:04:44.590 --> 01:04:47.894
Kennedy assassination-style
bullet theory here.

01:04:47.994 --> 01:04:49.896
<i>Two guns were used.
The guy in the middle...</i>

01:04:49.996 --> 01:04:53.056
was done with both of 'em.

01:04:53.165 --> 01:04:55.827
<i>But this guy, he was killed...</i>

01:04:55.935 --> 01:04:58.237
with bullets from gun "A" only...

01:04:58.337 --> 01:05:00.240
and this guy, gun "B" only.

01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:05.300
But ballistics dug two slugs
out of the wall from "B"...

01:05:05.412 --> 01:05:07.681
over here where the victim
was done with "A."

01:05:07.781 --> 01:05:10.671
<i>And it's the same thing over here.</i>

01:05:14.888 --> 01:05:17.686
Why the crossover?

01:05:17.791 --> 01:05:20.994
That's just fuckin' weird.
I have no idea.

01:05:21.094 --> 01:05:23.063
Jesus, I just can't think anymore.

01:05:23.163 --> 01:05:27.067
That scene over at the coffee shop
today just tapped me out.

01:05:27.167 --> 01:05:29.069
What scene?

01:05:29.169 --> 01:05:31.371
Some guy went nuts over off of Com Ave.

01:05:31.471 --> 01:05:35.543
Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop,
broad daylight, fled the scene.

01:05:35.643 --> 01:05:38.112
- Don't have much on him.
- Why wasn't I informed of this?

01:05:38.212 --> 01:05:40.348
They weren't related.
The guy used a. 38.

01:05:40.448 --> 01:05:43.051
- No pennies, totally amateur.
- Who were the victims?

01:05:43.151 --> 01:05:45.881
- A couple of mob peons
and a fat fuck bartender.

01:05:45.981 --> 01:05:47.255
Oh, isn't that beautiful?

01:05:47.355 --> 01:05:52.660
All the lowlifes in quiet city Boston start
droppin' dead, and you think it's unrelated!

01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:56.197
Greenly, the day I want the Boston Police
to do my thinkin' for me...

01:05:56.297 --> 01:05:58.700
I will have a fucking tag on my toe!

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:00.902
Now get me a squad car
and get me over there!

01:06:01.002 --> 01:06:05.762
I want crime scene photos
and any witness statements now!

01:06:24.026 --> 01:06:26.026
Wyatt fuckin' Earp!

01:06:28.263 --> 01:06:32.996
It looks like we got us a cowboy. Hmm.

01:06:33.102 --> 01:06:35.004
<i>"So we shall flow a river forth to Thee...</i>

01:06:35.104 --> 01:06:38.699
<i>and teeming with souls shall it ever be."</i>

01:06:44.313 --> 01:06:46.883
Hey, hey, man.
You guys gotta teach me that prayer.

01:06:46.983 --> 01:06:50.120
- That's some good shit, man.
- Cool it, Roc. It's a family prayer.

01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:53.095
My father's father before him.
So that's our shit.

01:06:53.195 --> 01:06:53.957
Oh, come on!

01:06:54.057 --> 01:06:55.959
<i>The victims were found...</i>

01:06:56.059 --> 01:06:57.961
<i>at a local adult entertainment parlor.</i>

01:06:58.061 --> 01:07:01.097
These murders, coupled with
the three suspected mob-related killings...

01:07:01.197 --> 01:07:04.601
that occurred at this local Boston deli
earlier this afternoon...

01:07:04.701 --> 01:07:07.203
brings the death toll to six,
just today.

01:07:07.303 --> 01:07:10.173
There is no doubt that all
the victims have been criminals.

01:07:10.273 --> 01:07:12.575
Perhaps this explains why a public outcry...

01:07:12.675 --> 01:07:15.812
to have these crimes stopped
has not been heard.

01:07:15.912 --> 01:07:19.082
Ah, these two crime scenes are related.

01:07:19.182 --> 01:07:21.913
Too many coincidences.

01:07:22.019 --> 01:07:24.255
<i>Same day, five hours apart...</i>

01:07:24.355 --> 01:07:26.915
<i>dead mobsters in both scenes.</i>

01:07:27.024 --> 01:07:28.926
Now...

01:07:29.026 --> 01:07:31.722
why did he kill the bartender?

01:07:31.829 --> 01:07:37.665
<i>Crime of passion. Just went nuts.
He shot everyone in here.</i>

01:07:37.768 --> 01:07:40.332
- Just ran out of bullets.
- Does this look like a friggin'

01:07:40.432 --> 01:07:41.305
post office to you?

01:07:41.405 --> 01:07:43.307
This guy came in here with intent.

01:07:43.407 --> 01:07:46.610
Maybe he didn't know exactly what he
was gonna do, but he had a good idea.

01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:48.779
<i>No, the bartender was no fuckin' accident.</i>

01:07:48.879 --> 01:07:51.082
Well, we didn't need any help on that.

01:07:51.182 --> 01:07:54.582
A lot of people saw it.
Nobody's talkin'.

01:07:55.487 --> 01:07:57.546
Figures.

01:07:57.656 --> 01:07:59.954
Oh, look.

01:08:00.058 --> 01:08:03.203
Are you guys seeing the pattern here?

01:08:05.130 --> 01:08:09.334
We got big questions at both of
these crime scenes with no answers.

01:08:09.434 --> 01:08:13.572
Why did they kill the guys
in the other two booths?

01:08:13.672 --> 01:08:16.300
Why did they do the bartender?

01:08:19.310 --> 01:08:21.939
Fuck!

01:08:22.046 --> 01:08:25.140
I hate cold crime scenes!

01:08:25.250 --> 01:08:27.290
I'm fucking leaving now.

01:08:29.889 --> 01:08:32.992
And do me a favor.
Tell me when the next one dies...

01:08:33.091 --> 01:08:36.067
<i>'cause these guys are not done yet.</i>

01:09:01.988 --> 01:09:03.988
Fuck you.

01:09:05.024 --> 01:09:07.755
Augustus, I need your help.

01:09:07.861 --> 01:09:12.536
I have a serious problem.
I am not screwing around here.

01:09:15.068 --> 01:09:17.434
I need... Il Duce.

01:09:35.721 --> 01:09:38.953
The Duke? Huh.

01:09:39.059 --> 01:09:41.858
What did you do?

01:09:41.962 --> 01:09:44.796
Rocco- this package boy...

01:09:44.899 --> 01:09:46.968
he could bring down the whole East Coast.

01:09:47.068 --> 01:09:49.703
If he decides to turn state's evidence...

01:09:49.804 --> 01:09:52.874
he could take us apart brick by brick.

01:09:52.974 --> 01:09:55.909
But he's happy, now...

01:09:56.010 --> 01:09:58.808
with just killing us one by one.

01:09:58.913 --> 01:10:03.077
And worse, he's good at it.

01:10:03.184 --> 01:10:07.555
Listen, kid. I hope you understand
who you're dealin' with here.

01:10:07.655 --> 01:10:10.488
This guy is no slouch.

01:10:10.591 --> 01:10:12.493
<i>When I was a boy...</i>

01:10:12.593 --> 01:10:16.565
you and papa used to speak of him
like he was a ghost.

01:10:16.665 --> 01:10:19.395
Move him.

01:10:21.403 --> 01:10:25.541
<i>Your father and I used him
three times in 20 years...</i>

01:10:25.641 --> 01:10:29.042
<i>only when things got totally fucked.</i>

01:10:29.144 --> 01:10:32.014
<i>Whenever we needed
one of our own bumped off...</i>

01:10:32.114 --> 01:10:34.139
<i>we'd call this guy in.</i>

01:10:34.249 --> 01:10:36.885
<i>He had a thing for clippin' wise guys.</i>

01:10:36.985 --> 01:10:39.249
<i>But only one rule:</i>

01:10:39.355 --> 01:10:41.721
<i>No women, no kids.</i>

01:10:41.824 --> 01:10:44.493
<i>Believe me, kid,
you don't want this guy...</i>

01:10:44.593 --> 01:10:49.257
<i>unless you are 100% sure you need him.</i>

01:10:49.365 --> 01:10:52.302
<i>He's a fuckin' monster.
But only one thing.</i>

01:10:52.402 --> 01:10:55.338
He's been rottin' in the can
the last 25 or 30 years.

01:10:55.438 --> 01:11:00.538
<i>Don't even know if heâs still
alive or if heâs even up to it.</i>

01:11:15.325 --> 01:11:17.325
There.

01:11:19.162 --> 01:11:23.837
- Well, there are ways around that.
- Yeah. Go find one.

01:11:27.705 --> 01:11:29.874
All right.
Let's talk some business here.

01:11:29.974 --> 01:11:35.754
I know a sick fuck makes the ones
we been doin' look like altar boys.

01:11:36.247 --> 01:11:38.649
<i>Worst night of my life when I met this guy.</i>

01:11:38.749 --> 01:11:41.218
<i>The guy never says a fuckin' word to me.</i>

01:11:41.318 --> 01:11:43.421
<i>We're drivin'25 minutes...</i>

01:11:43.521 --> 01:11:47.389
<i>never a sigh,
no throat clearing, nothing.</i>

01:11:49.093 --> 01:11:54.363
<i>Yeah, you're always making great
fuckin' sense, you dumb bitch.</i>

01:11:54.598 --> 01:11:57.328
<i>I don't care.</i>

01:11:57.435 --> 01:12:00.997
<i>His face-blank, man. Just nothin' there.</i>

01:12:01.106 --> 01:12:04.076
<i>This guy takes out a whole family...</i>

01:12:04.176 --> 01:12:08.851
<i>wife, kids, everyone-like
he's ordering a fucking pizza.</i>

01:12:10.248 --> 01:12:13.115
This house is clean.

01:12:15.187 --> 01:12:19.437
<i>I knew if I didn't keep it together,
it was my ass.</i>

01:12:23.295 --> 01:12:25.497
<i>He has a poker game
out back of his place...</i>

01:12:25.597 --> 01:12:29.082
<i>with a bunch of wise guys every Saturday.</i>

01:12:38.611 --> 01:12:41.444
Worst day of my life, man.

01:12:41.547 --> 01:12:44.641
Well, I'm sold.

01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:50.022
Don't worry, Roc.

01:12:50.122 --> 01:12:54.627
We'll do this guy right,
and you'll feel a lot better.

01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:15.508
Okay.

01:13:15.616 --> 01:13:17.616
Here's what happened.

01:13:23.223 --> 01:13:28.663
They waited in a parked car down
the street for the kid to leave.

01:13:30.297 --> 01:13:32.322
There he goes.

01:13:37.304 --> 01:13:39.440
They came in through the garage.

01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:44.385
The kid says he leaves it open
when he takes his bike out.

01:13:44.811 --> 01:13:48.783
Now they know the wife
is the gatekeeper. She knows the code.

01:13:48.883 --> 01:13:51.286
Hit the numbers, lady. Hit the numbers.

01:13:51.386 --> 01:13:54.823
- I will kill you! I will kill you!
- Don't! Her hands are taped.

01:13:54.923 --> 01:13:57.292
Why do I always gotta be on bitch detail?

01:13:57.392 --> 01:14:00.695
The wife says she doesn't know
what happened after she hit the code.

01:14:00.795 --> 01:14:02.293
She just remembers going down,

01:14:02.393 --> 01:14:04.666
but judging from the
burn mark on her back...

01:14:04.766 --> 01:14:08.336
I think what they did
was use a stun gun on her.

01:14:08.436 --> 01:14:11.773
Now this guy knows
that his friend is coming to the game...

01:14:11.873 --> 01:14:15.643
and they know that this door can
only be opened from the inside.

01:14:15.743 --> 01:14:19.338
So they wait.
And when that door opens...

01:14:19.447 --> 01:14:21.448
man...

01:14:22.518 --> 01:14:24.518
nobody's ready for it.

01:14:30.893 --> 01:14:34.090
Panic, devastation.

01:14:34.196 --> 01:14:38.276
This was like shootin' fish
in a friggin' barrel.

01:14:38.701 --> 01:14:40.828
All of 'em.

01:15:05.362 --> 01:15:07.430
<i>Now these guys dove under the table.</i>

01:15:07.530 --> 01:15:11.535
<i>The trajectory on the bullet showed that
they came from straight across.</i>

01:15:11.635 --> 01:15:16.225
<i>So that means one of our
shooters dropped to his knees.</i>

01:15:38.629 --> 01:15:42.700
- Something went wrong right here.
- Shit! Shit! He ain't here!

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:45.469
<i>Oh, what the fuck you mean,
he isn't here?</i>

01:15:45.569 --> 01:15:48.372
- I mean he ain't here!
- Look again, for fuck's sake!

01:15:48.472 --> 01:15:51.447
I know what the fuck he looks like!

01:15:52.176 --> 01:15:54.872
Look behind ya!

01:15:54.979 --> 01:15:56.979
Ah! Son of a-

01:15:58.983 --> 01:16:01.611
Oh, shit!

01:16:01.719 --> 01:16:04.210
Shoot this motherfucker!

01:16:04.321 --> 01:16:07.086
No!
Fucking let the bloke go!

01:16:07.192 --> 01:16:10.093
- Let him go!
- Fuck! Jesus!

01:16:10.195 --> 01:16:12.154
- Now's your chance
to earn your stripes, Roc!

01:16:12.254 --> 01:16:13.198
He'll fucking get killed!

01:16:13.298 --> 01:16:15.233
It was your idea to bring him in!

01:16:15.333 --> 01:16:18.070
One of these guys is a real sicko.

01:16:18.170 --> 01:16:20.772
He knew this man.
He wanted him to suffer.

01:16:20.872 --> 01:16:24.035
<i>All right, Roc.
Now's your chance!</i>

01:16:24.142 --> 01:16:27.542
- You take that man!
- I don't wanna die!

01:16:48.701 --> 01:16:51.568
Sick fuck! Sick fuck!

01:16:51.671 --> 01:16:54.265
<i>Sick fuck!</i>

01:16:54.373 --> 01:16:58.275
- All right then.
- Fuck you, fuckin'-

01:16:58.377 --> 01:17:01.648
Now take a fuckin' deep breath
there, Roc. You did fine.

01:17:01.748 --> 01:17:03.748
It was nicely done.

01:17:07.386 --> 01:17:10.287
They exited out the front door.

01:17:10.389 --> 01:17:13.704
<i>They had no idea what they were in for.</i>

01:17:26.273 --> 01:17:29.943
<i>Now they're starin'
at six men with guns drawn.</i>

01:17:30.043 --> 01:17:32.238
It was a fuckin' ambush.

01:17:35.349 --> 01:17:37.251
<i>This was a fuckin' bomb...</i>

01:17:37.351 --> 01:17:40.071
<i>droppin' on Beaver Cleaverville.</i>

01:17:41.388 --> 01:17:46.348
<i>For a few seconds,
this place was Armageddon.</i>

01:17:48.428 --> 01:17:50.897
There was a firefight!

01:18:39.682 --> 01:18:42.708
You son of a bitch!

01:19:11.948 --> 01:19:14.416
Murph, are you all right?

01:19:14.517 --> 01:19:16.951
Motherfucker!

01:19:17.053 --> 01:19:21.191
<i>- Roc, get the fucking bag!
- Fuckin' shit! Christ!</i>

01:19:21.291 --> 01:19:24.227
- Get the blood! Get the blood!
- What the fuck was that?

01:19:24.327 --> 01:19:26.108
He shot my fucking finger off!

01:19:26.208 --> 01:19:28.732
Roc, what the fuck? Get
the fuck out of here!

01:19:28.832 --> 01:19:31.699
- Motherfucker!
- Fucking shit!

01:19:31.801 --> 01:19:34.905
- Get the fucking bag!
- My fucking finger!

01:19:35.005 --> 01:19:37.099
Fucking shit!

01:19:41.979 --> 01:19:45.383
What if it was just one guy with six guns?

01:19:45.483 --> 01:19:49.648
Why don't you let me do
the thinking, huh, genius?

01:19:50.421 --> 01:19:53.324
Hey, what's taking so long
with those blood samples?

01:19:53.424 --> 01:19:55.459
<i>I can't get a good sample.</i>

01:19:55.559 --> 01:19:57.528
Oh!

01:19:57.628 --> 01:20:00.943
There's a variable here I'm not seeing.

01:20:12.344 --> 01:20:16.007
They used ammonia.

01:20:16.114 --> 01:20:18.776
None of this is any good.
Fuck!

01:20:18.884 --> 01:20:21.954
<i>You know what that means?
Even if we get suspects in the case...</i>

01:20:22.054 --> 01:20:23.956
we got nothin', nothin', nothin'!

01:20:24.056 --> 01:20:26.684
Fuck! Who the fuck are they?

01:20:26.792 --> 01:20:30.462
<i>I've never seen any fucking thing
like this in my fucking life!</i>

01:20:30.562 --> 01:20:32.962
Who the fuck are they?

01:21:10.303 --> 01:21:13.973
<i>Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know
you fucking know, so don't even start.</i>

01:21:14.073 --> 01:21:16.242
Fuck you! I told you I never saw him before!

01:21:16.342 --> 01:21:18.645
Well, he sure as fuck knew you!

01:21:18.745 --> 01:21:21.340
Fuck you! Fuck you both!

01:21:21.448 --> 01:21:23.350
Yeah? Don't start lying to us now!

01:21:23.450 --> 01:21:26.340
We're fuckin' three amateurs here!

01:22:10.865 --> 01:22:13.969
I'm confident that
their investigation will end...

01:22:14.069 --> 01:22:17.129
<i>in the apprehension of the suspects.</i>

01:22:18.239 --> 01:22:21.606
- Fuckin' hell.
- What? What, that guy?

01:22:21.709 --> 01:22:24.946
That's the guy that got us off the hook
with the Checkov thing.

01:22:25.046 --> 01:22:27.048
- And he's one smart man.
- They got nothin'.

01:22:27.148 --> 01:22:31.220
Well, this guy is very sharp.
If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.

01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:34.514
- You bet your ass he will.
- Well, I'd say that makes him...

01:22:34.614 --> 01:22:35.591
a lia-fuckin'-bility.

01:22:35.691 --> 01:22:39.328
- He isn't to be touched.
- He's a good man.

01:22:39.428 --> 01:22:41.453
Okay, whatever.

01:23:17.634 --> 01:23:21.661
No, that's all wrong.
David Della-

01:23:25.909 --> 01:23:27.909
I missed it.

01:23:43.628 --> 01:23:46.464
Paul, you've already had quite a bit.
Are you sure you wanna-

01:23:46.564 --> 01:23:50.159
Just pour the drink, you fairy fuck.

01:23:50.268 --> 01:23:53.704
Whew! I smell you.

01:24:09.820 --> 01:24:11.820
<i>Hey, Murph.</i>

01:24:11.923 --> 01:24:14.559
This early mornin' church shit's gotta go.

01:24:14.659 --> 01:24:19.760
We have to go in the mornin'.
We're on the lam now, you know.

01:25:17.056 --> 01:25:19.056
Hey.

01:25:23.263 --> 01:25:26.238
You're gonna do what I say, got it?

01:25:30.271 --> 01:25:32.773
- Yes.
- I'm sorry you're gonna have to see this.

01:25:32.873 --> 01:25:34.775
- Don't look at me.
- I didn't see any-

01:25:34.875 --> 01:25:37.002
Shut up.
Shut the fuck up.

01:25:37.111 --> 01:25:40.774
<i>Don't do this, my son.</i>

01:25:40.881 --> 01:25:42.783
<i>Have you no fear of God?</i>

01:25:42.883 --> 01:25:46.187
That's who I'm doin' this for.
Now open the fuckin' thing, Father.

01:25:46.287 --> 01:25:48.856
<i>Father, I'll do you right here.</i>

01:25:48.956 --> 01:25:51.424
God have mercy on my soul.

01:25:54.628 --> 01:25:57.965
You little fuck, let him go, or
I'll drop you right fuckin' now.

01:25:58.065 --> 01:26:01.035
Okay, just calm down.
He could hurt us, brother.

01:26:01.135 --> 01:26:03.505
<i>- He could ruin the whole thing.
- You let him go...</i>

01:26:03.605 --> 01:26:05.840
<i>or I will deliver you right fucking here!</i>

01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:08.777
You won't do it. You won't, Conner.
You love me, man.

01:26:08.877 --> 01:26:10.344
- I swear to fuckin'-
- Hello. You there?

01:26:10.444 --> 01:26:11.880
- I swear to fuckin'-
- Hello. You there?

01:26:11.980 --> 01:26:13.949
Y-Yes, my son.

01:26:14.049 --> 01:26:17.619
Do your thing, Father. Don't fuck this up.

01:26:19.220 --> 01:26:22.524
<i>- How long since your last confession?
- Christ.</i>

01:26:22.624 --> 01:26:25.718
I've never confessed.

01:26:25.827 --> 01:26:28.318
I come here for advice...

01:26:28.430 --> 01:26:31.024
not "slalvation."

01:26:31.132 --> 01:26:35.136
<i>Why have you come to a church
for counsel if you're not religious?</i>

01:26:35.236 --> 01:26:38.297
It's ethics.

01:26:38.407 --> 01:26:41.672
I put evil men behind bars...

01:26:41.777 --> 01:26:45.681
but the law has miles
of red tape and loopholes...

01:26:45.781 --> 01:26:48.718
for these cocksuckers to slip through.

01:26:48.818 --> 01:26:52.355
<i>I found... out there are these two guys...</i>

01:26:52.455 --> 01:26:54.924
<i>who fix the situation with an iron fist...</i>

01:26:55.024 --> 01:26:57.026
as if they had God's permission.

01:26:57.126 --> 01:26:59.528
God's permission?
God doesn't grant-

01:26:59.628 --> 01:27:01.530
In this day and age...

01:27:01.630 --> 01:27:04.200
I believe what they do is necessary.

01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:06.300
I feel it is correct.

01:27:06.402 --> 01:27:08.671
<i>A soul is what gives us feelings.</i>

01:27:08.771 --> 01:27:11.605
It's like a conduit...

01:27:11.708 --> 01:27:14.511
through which the Lord speaks to us.

01:27:14.611 --> 01:27:17.381
<i>You felt your answers would be here...</i>

01:27:17.481 --> 01:27:20.177
<i>in the house of the Lord today.</i>

01:27:20.283 --> 01:27:24.276
<i>And you feel...
These men are necessary.</i>

01:27:26.323 --> 01:27:28.792
<i>So the Lord has spoken to you twice today.</i>

01:27:28.892 --> 01:27:30.794
Has He now?

01:27:30.894 --> 01:27:35.565
You are the one who came into this church
speaking about beliefs and feelings.

01:27:35.665 --> 01:27:39.202
<i>Is it so hard to believe
that God has brought you here?</i>

01:27:39.302 --> 01:27:41.204
<i>I guess not.</i>

01:27:41.304 --> 01:27:44.241
It's very easy to be sarcastic about religion.

01:27:44.341 --> 01:27:47.311
<i>But it's much more difficult...</i>

01:27:47.412 --> 01:27:49.437
to take a stand.

01:27:50.882 --> 01:27:54.519
<i>I wanna stand for what I believe in, Father.</i>

01:27:54.619 --> 01:27:58.359
<i>First you have to know
what your beliefs are.</i>

01:27:58.589 --> 01:28:02.958
I believe that these young men are right.

01:28:03.060 --> 01:28:06.552
- You know them personally?
- Yes.

01:28:06.664 --> 01:28:10.134
Would they ever harm
an innocent person, for any reason?

01:28:10.234 --> 01:28:13.328
No. They would never do that.

01:28:13.438 --> 01:28:16.107
Well, the two Irish guys wouldn't.

01:28:16.207 --> 01:28:19.610
The Italian guy, he might.
He's kind of an idiot.

01:28:19.710 --> 01:28:22.305
I'm beginning to see.

01:28:22.414 --> 01:28:25.474
All the things I wish I could do...

01:28:25.584 --> 01:28:28.075
these guys are doing.

01:28:28.187 --> 01:28:31.816
<i>W-W-What should I do?</i>

01:28:31.924 --> 01:28:35.416
Because I am a man...

01:28:35.527 --> 01:28:38.360
who's supposed to uphold the law.

01:28:38.464 --> 01:28:42.264
<i>The laws of God... are higher...</i>

01:28:42.367 --> 01:28:46.497
than the laws... of man.

01:28:46.605 --> 01:28:50.876
<i>Yes, I-I was thinking that too.
No, no. I was feeling it.</i>

01:28:50.976 --> 01:28:54.036
All I needed was to hear you say it.

01:28:55.914 --> 01:28:59.476
Amen. I will help them.

01:28:59.586 --> 01:29:03.071
- Forgive me, Father.
- Thank you, Father.

01:29:05.258 --> 01:29:07.590
Whatever.

01:29:07.694 --> 01:29:09.855
Amen. Good-bye.

01:29:18.605 --> 01:29:23.008
<i>Now listen.
Um, "dominus ominus," you know.</i>

01:29:23.109 --> 01:29:27.013
And remember, you're bound. You can't
talk to anyone about this. No one.

01:29:27.113 --> 01:29:29.716
- Just get out of the church.
- Okay.

01:29:29.816 --> 01:29:32.581
Just get out of the church!

01:29:35.823 --> 01:29:38.917
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

01:29:39.026 --> 01:29:42.256
What the fuck's that supposed to mean?

01:29:43.697 --> 01:29:46.700
- That's all you can give me?
- The light hit the side of his face.

01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:50.204
Looked like he had a gray beard.
Maybe late '50s, early '60s.

01:29:50.304 --> 01:29:52.907
So you're telling me
it was one guy with six guns...

01:29:53.007 --> 01:29:55.876
and he was a senior freakin' citizen?

01:29:55.976 --> 01:29:58.979
Yeah, and it's better if we find
this man before he finds us again.

01:29:59.079 --> 01:30:01.782
I'll see what I can do.
How do I get in touch with you?

01:30:01.882 --> 01:30:05.853
We'll hit Pappa Joe tonight,
right in the comfort of his own home.

01:30:05.953 --> 01:30:08.623
We're gonna move on to New York.
It's just...

01:30:08.723 --> 01:30:11.693
- It's getting a bit hot for us here.
- Be careful.

01:30:11.793 --> 01:30:13.929
All right.
Call you tonight, afterwards.

01:30:14.029 --> 01:30:18.619
- It feels like it's still there.
- Yeah, but it's not.

01:30:19.534 --> 01:30:22.731
<i>I don't know who he is. Nobody does.</i>

01:30:22.837 --> 01:30:26.641
<i>The Duke's a fuckin' Houdini.
He does a disappearin' act.</i>

01:30:26.741 --> 01:30:28.643
What did he bring him in for?

01:30:28.743 --> 01:30:33.271
Well, he needs an outsider.
This Rocco kid is smart.

01:30:33.381 --> 01:30:36.918
He knows everyone.
He'd spot our hitters a mile away.

01:30:37.018 --> 01:30:39.421
Just for him- the package boy?

01:30:39.521 --> 01:30:43.793
He's the one shootin' up all his guys,
right? He's scared of the kid.

01:30:43.893 --> 01:30:47.107
<i>- Said he's good. He's got
every gun in the city up there.</i>

01:30:47.207 --> 01:30:47.797
Up where?

01:30:47.897 --> 01:30:50.666
Up at his house.
I don't know what's going on...

01:30:50.766 --> 01:30:52.768
<i>but I know it's gotta have
something to do with this kid.</i>

01:30:52.868 --> 01:30:54.868
Oh, fuck!

01:31:02.612 --> 01:31:05.882
We got 'em. They tried to get in
through the basement.

01:31:05.982 --> 01:31:07.982
- How many?
- Three.

01:31:16.759 --> 01:31:19.663
<i>Where you goin', huh?
Where the fuck you goin', huh?</i>

01:31:19.763 --> 01:31:23.163
I'm fuckin' talkin' to you,
motherfucker!

01:31:25.869 --> 01:31:29.828
- Fuck you!
- Shut up!

01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:31.842
Shh! Shh.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:31:31.942 --> 01:31:36.538
Shh.

01:31:39.383 --> 01:31:42.181
Sit up.

01:31:42.285 --> 01:31:45.345
You have some answers for me, no?

01:31:45.455 --> 01:31:48.822
Yeah. Fuck you.

01:31:50.961 --> 01:31:53.988
Roc! Roc, look at me!

01:31:54.098 --> 01:31:56.965
Roc!

01:31:57.068 --> 01:31:59.730
Shit!

01:31:59.837 --> 01:32:03.136
Roc!

01:32:05.309 --> 01:32:08.710
Roc! Roc, you'll be fine!

01:32:11.482 --> 01:32:14.383
<i>Roc!</i>

01:32:16.721 --> 01:32:20.157
Okay.
What do you boys think?

01:32:20.258 --> 01:32:22.627
- These guys are tough.
- Fuckin'-A, right.

01:32:22.727 --> 01:32:25.063
- Ain't no fuckin' way they're gonna talk.
- I know Rocco.

01:32:25.163 --> 01:32:28.133
He ain't smart enough for this shit.
Those other guys are the brains.

01:32:28.233 --> 01:32:31.225
- He's just a player.
- He's a punk.

01:32:32.304 --> 01:32:34.769
There's only one thing to do.

01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:45.343
God! No!

01:32:48.153 --> 01:32:53.455
Roc! Roc! No!

01:32:55.527 --> 01:32:57.552
Roc! Roc!

01:32:57.663 --> 01:33:01.064
No!

01:33:01.166 --> 01:33:03.692
No! Roc!

01:33:03.803 --> 01:33:05.705
<i>Roc!</i>

01:33:05.805 --> 01:33:10.110
You can't stop! You get out of here.
Don't ever stop.

01:33:10.210 --> 01:33:12.872
<i>Roc! No!</i>

01:33:16.983 --> 01:33:20.976
<i>No! Roc!</i>

01:33:21.087 --> 01:33:23.783
You motherfucker!

01:33:23.890 --> 01:33:27.826
Yeah!
I'm gonna kill them!

01:33:30.930 --> 01:33:33.133
<i>- Hey, boss.
- Yeah, Chappy?</i>

01:33:33.233 --> 01:33:36.102
I don't mean no disrespect,
but I think we're forgettin' something here.

01:33:36.202 --> 01:33:39.840
This Il Duce's a fuckin' animal.
He's gonna stop when someone dies.

01:33:39.940 --> 01:33:44.445
I guarantee you right now,
he thinks this thing is on.

01:33:52.153 --> 01:33:55.316
<i>What?</i>

01:33:58.025 --> 01:34:00.661
If this guy still thinks the job is on...

01:34:00.761 --> 01:34:04.629
motherfucker is in the bushes right now.

01:34:04.732 --> 01:34:09.101
I am going.
You four... stay here...

01:34:09.203 --> 01:34:11.203
and deal with it.

01:34:28.690 --> 01:34:30.715
Do it!

01:34:30.826 --> 01:34:34.062
- Just one fuckin' guy.
- Fuck you, Geno.

01:34:34.162 --> 01:34:37.392
- What's the big fuckin' deal?
- Do it!

01:34:44.873 --> 01:34:49.379
I'm going back downstairs
and workin' on these pricks.

01:34:50.813 --> 01:34:54.305
What the fuck?

01:35:09.799 --> 01:35:12.165
Hey.

01:35:12.268 --> 01:35:15.032
Joey Bevo sent me over...

01:35:15.137 --> 01:35:17.571
as entertainment.

01:35:17.673 --> 01:35:19.575
<i>Sorry, baby. Tonight
ain't the night for this shit.</i>

01:35:19.675 --> 01:35:24.715
It's really hittin' the fan in there,
you know what I'm sayin'?

01:35:24.815 --> 01:35:29.830
Fuckin' Bevo's great, man.
He's always sendin' us primo box.

01:35:46.136 --> 01:35:49.230
All right. Let's go.

01:35:59.150 --> 01:36:01.119
<i>Come here.</i>

01:36:01.219 --> 01:36:03.388
<i>- What the fuck are you doing?
- Come on, man.</i>

01:36:03.488 --> 01:36:07.992
I haven't been laid in a week.
It'll take five minutes.

01:36:08.092 --> 01:36:10.322
Hurry up!

01:36:14.933 --> 01:36:18.630
Oh, baby. Oh, come to Mama.

01:36:18.736 --> 01:36:21.208
- You're a dirty girl. No.
- Come to Mama.

01:36:21.308 --> 01:36:22.740
Oh, come to Mama. Oh.

01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:24.742
<i>- You wanna ride the champ?
- Yeah, baby.</i>

01:36:24.842 --> 01:36:26.788
All right. All right.
Let's do it, man. Ringside.

01:36:26.888 --> 01:36:27.579
<i>Big, strong man.</i>

01:36:27.679 --> 01:36:30.151
- Come on, baby.
- Yeah, that's right. You want...

01:36:30.251 --> 01:36:31.449
a little shot at the title?

01:36:31.549 --> 01:36:34.854
I'll give you a shot at the title right here...

01:36:34.954 --> 01:36:36.954
<i>What the fuck?</i>

01:36:55.441 --> 01:36:57.441
Too far.

01:36:58.978 --> 01:37:00.978
Too far.

01:37:19.232 --> 01:37:21.232
It's on now.

01:37:23.570 --> 01:37:25.570
It's on now.

01:37:31.411 --> 01:37:34.216
Hey, babe.
What's it, two for one?

01:38:12.153 --> 01:38:14.088
"And shepherds we shall be...

01:38:14.188 --> 01:38:16.590
<i>"for Thee, my Lord, for Thee.</i>

01:38:16.690 --> 01:38:21.458
Power hath descended forth from Thy ha-"

01:38:23.698 --> 01:38:29.068
"That our feet may swiftly
carry out Thy command.

01:38:29.171 --> 01:38:33.130
<i>"We will flow a river forth unto Thee...</i>

01:38:33.241 --> 01:38:36.802
<i>and teeming with souls shall it ever be."</i>

01:38:56.099 --> 01:38:58.534
<i>Standing trial today for
the third time in two years...</i>

01:38:58.634 --> 01:39:01.070
is infamous Mafia don
Pappa Joe Yakavetta.

01:39:01.170 --> 01:39:03.506
<i>Yakavetta takes the stand
to defend himself...</i>

01:39:03.606 --> 01:39:05.575
<i>against allegations of his involvement...</i>

01:39:05.675 --> 01:39:08.745
<i>in the ordered killings
of no less than 17 men.</i>

01:39:08.845 --> 01:39:12.515
<i>The state's case against him relies heavily
on circumstantial evidence...</i>

01:39:12.615 --> 01:39:14.584
<i>and a third acquittal
has already been predicted.</i>

01:39:14.684 --> 01:39:18.814
<i>Never shall innocent blood be shed.</i>

01:39:18.921 --> 01:39:20.957
<i>Yet, the blood of the wicked...</i>

01:39:21.057 --> 01:39:23.890
<i>shall flow like a river.</i>

01:39:25.161 --> 01:39:27.530
<i>The three shall spread
their blackened wings...</i>

01:39:27.631 --> 01:39:31.286
<i>and be the vengeful,
striking hammer of God.</i>

01:39:32.002 --> 01:39:34.232
Ah, I was with my mother.

01:39:34.338 --> 01:39:36.807
We were at the Genovese- the butcher...

01:39:36.907 --> 01:39:40.077
- because on Thursdays
she makes a gnocchi for...

01:39:40.177 --> 01:39:42.577
<i>Mr. Yakavetta...</i>

01:39:42.679 --> 01:39:45.482
you will demonstrate order
in my courtroom.

01:39:45.582 --> 01:39:48.419
<i>- Counsel, proceed.
- Look at his charisma.</i>

01:39:48.519 --> 01:39:51.588
- He's the next John Gotti.
- He'll walk...

01:39:51.688 --> 01:39:53.590
even with all this evidence.

01:39:53.690 --> 01:39:56.326
Look, all of Yakavetta's people
are on the left.

01:39:56.426 --> 01:39:58.962
All the families of the men
he's killed are on the right.

01:39:59.062 --> 01:40:00.964
Everyone wants some justice.

01:40:01.064 --> 01:40:04.469
- I don't know where I was.
- Look at him.

01:40:04.569 --> 01:40:06.738
He doesn't have a care in the world.

01:40:06.838 --> 01:40:10.069
He's gonna walk.

01:40:10.175 --> 01:40:13.611
<i>You, to the back!</i>

01:40:16.948 --> 01:40:18.950
Shut the fucking camera!

01:40:19.050 --> 01:40:23.354
Up top, drop your guns!
One at a time! Now! Drop it!

01:40:23.454 --> 01:40:25.457
- Come here.
- Where are you taking me?

01:40:25.557 --> 01:40:28.827
- What are you doing? What are you doing?
- Shut the fuck up!

01:40:28.927 --> 01:40:30.986
Get to the back!

01:40:35.633 --> 01:40:38.184
You people have been chosen...

01:40:39.838 --> 01:40:42.983
to reveal our existence to the world!

01:40:44.243 --> 01:40:47.146
You will witness
what happens here today...

01:40:47.246 --> 01:40:49.976
and you will tell of it later.

01:40:50.082 --> 01:40:51.984
All eyes to the front.

01:40:52.084 --> 01:40:57.014
- Now is a good time to fucking-
- Shut your fuckin' mouth!

01:41:09.868 --> 01:41:12.132
You must watch, dear.

01:41:12.238 --> 01:41:14.366
It'll all be over soon.

01:41:24.117 --> 01:41:26.086
Get down, get down, get down!

01:41:26.186 --> 01:41:28.416
Now you will receive us!

01:41:28.521 --> 01:41:31.491
We do not ask
for your poor or your hungry!

01:41:31.591 --> 01:41:33.994
We do not want your tired and sick!

01:41:34.094 --> 01:41:38.231
- It is your corrupt we claim.
- It is your evil that will be sought by us!

01:41:38.331 --> 01:41:41.501
With every breath,
we shall hunt them down.

01:41:41.601 --> 01:41:43.737
Each day we will spill their blood...

01:41:43.837 --> 01:41:45.839
till it rains down from the skies!

01:41:45.939 --> 01:41:49.177
Do not kill. Do not rape. Do not steal.

01:41:49.277 --> 01:41:52.780
<i>These are principles which every
man of every faith can embrace!</i>

01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:56.984
These are not polite suggestions!
These are codes of behavior...

01:41:57.084 --> 01:42:00.021
<i>and those of you that ignore
them will pay the dearest cost!</i>

01:42:00.121 --> 01:42:02.323
There are varying degrees of evil.

01:42:02.423 --> 01:42:07.361
We urge you lesser forms of filth
not to push the bounds and cross over...

01:42:07.461 --> 01:42:10.531
<i>into true corruption, into our domain.</i>

01:42:10.631 --> 01:42:13.901
For if you do, one day
you will look behind you...

01:42:14.001 --> 01:42:15.903
<i>and you will see we three.</i>

01:42:16.003 --> 01:42:19.370
<i>And on that day, you will reap it!</i>

01:42:19.473 --> 01:42:23.299
And we will send you
to whatever god you wish.

01:42:27.916 --> 01:42:30.219
"And shepherds we will be,
for Thee, my Lord, for Thee.

01:42:30.319 --> 01:42:32.921
"Power hath descended forth
from Thy hand...

01:42:33.021 --> 01:42:36.024
- "that our feet may swiftly
carry out Thy command.

01:42:36.124 --> 01:42:38.327
"So we shall flow a river forth to Thee...

01:42:38.427 --> 01:42:41.912
and teeming with souls shall it ever be."

01:43:02.418 --> 01:43:04.454
Did you see what happened?

01:43:04.554 --> 01:43:06.886
Yes, I was there.

01:43:13.529 --> 01:43:17.226
How far are we going to take this, Da?

01:43:23.606 --> 01:43:25.986
The question is not how far.

01:43:27.443 --> 01:43:32.676
The question is,
do you possess the constitution...

01:43:32.782 --> 01:43:35.377
the depth of faith...

01:43:35.486 --> 01:43:37.696
to go as far as is needed?

01:43:41.792 --> 01:43:44.261
After the astonishing display
of vigilantism...

01:43:44.361 --> 01:43:46.463
during the Yakavetta trial yesterday...

01:43:46.563 --> 01:43:49.366
the largest manhunt in recent
memory is being undertaken...

01:43:49.466 --> 01:43:52.870
to capture three men the media
have dubbed "the Saints."

01:43:52.970 --> 01:43:54.875
This reporter went out to the street to...

01:43:54.975 --> 01:43:56.974
find out what you thought
about these three.

01:43:57.074 --> 01:43:59.243
Somebody can just go out,
get a gun and shoot somebody...

01:43:59.343 --> 01:44:01.712
because they feel they're
doing some good in the world?

01:44:01.812 --> 01:44:04.283
- No comment.
- Making the world a safer place.

01:44:04.383 --> 01:44:05.249
Are you kidding?

01:44:05.349 --> 01:44:07.914
- They're killing for good
and only the people who kill.

01:44:08.015 --> 01:44:08.853
Listen to yourself.

01:44:08.953 --> 01:44:10.855
This is gonna create
something so much worse.

01:44:10.955 --> 01:44:14.359
- I don't think so at all.
- Well, I think you're just naive then.

01:44:14.459 --> 01:44:16.428
I love the Saints, man.
They doin' a great job.

01:44:16.528 --> 01:44:18.963
Keep it goin', man.
Get these murderers off the streets.

01:44:19.063 --> 01:44:21.499
They're not out there just killing for fame.

01:44:21.599 --> 01:44:24.336
- They just wanna be famous.
- They should be in every major city.

01:44:24.436 --> 01:44:26.338
- Every major city.
- These guys are playing God.

01:44:26.438 --> 01:44:29.007
This whole religious twist.
Who do they think they are?

01:44:29.107 --> 01:44:32.077
I believe in capital punishment.
If they let me, I'd pull the switch.

01:44:32.177 --> 01:44:33.712
Get 'em all! Kill 'em all!

01:44:35.847 --> 01:44:39.818
The more people they kill, the better
it is for everybody. That's what they get-

01:44:39.918 --> 01:44:42.320
No, do not do that, Laquelle,
because you don't even know!

01:44:42.420 --> 01:44:45.291
- Sign me up, man.
- Sign me up. All right?

01:44:45.391 --> 01:44:48.027
- Where can I sign up?
- Who are they to be judge and jury?

01:44:48.127 --> 01:44:51.597
- No. What if your mom sees?
- No comment.

01:44:51.697 --> 01:44:53.532
- No comment.
- I'm afraid for myself.

01:44:53.632 --> 01:44:55.534
I'm afraid for my kids.
I'm afraid to walk down the street.

01:44:55.634 --> 01:44:57.737
I can't even believe you're
saying that. That's crazy.

01:44:57.837 --> 01:44:59.739
When did you turn into such a sissy?

01:44:59.839 --> 01:45:02.775
- I think they just get off on killing people.
- Well, I have no comment.

01:45:02.875 --> 01:45:05.945
- No comment on that, dear.
- I have nothing to say. Thanks.

01:45:06.045 --> 01:45:08.981
All this hoopla with the media.
You guys are making it worse right now.

01:45:09.081 --> 01:45:10.983
You're giving them the power.

01:45:11.083 --> 01:45:13.252
By sticking that in my face,
you're giving the Saints power.

01:45:13.352 --> 01:45:17.323
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- I really don't wanna talk about that.

01:45:17.423 --> 01:45:19.926
You walk into some kid's bedroom,
and it's gonna be there.

01:45:20.026 --> 01:45:22.662
You have Batman, Superman
and these Saints.

01:45:22.762 --> 01:45:24.664
Are you losing any sleep, honey?

01:45:24.764 --> 01:45:27.968
- 'Cause you know what? I'm certainly not.
- No comment.

01:45:28.068 --> 01:45:31.471
- Don't talk to them.
- They're damn good. They're right!

01:45:33.573 --> 01:45:35.542
Okay? I'm ready to get busy too.

01:45:35.642 --> 01:45:38.277
<i>You know,
I'm ready to get busy.</i>
