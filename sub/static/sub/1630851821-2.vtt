WEBVTT

00:16.383 --> 00:18.385
The monsters are coming.

00:18.451 --> 00:20.220
We'll make them go away.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.389
Let's play a game, okay?

00:23.123 --> 00:26.026
Start counting from twen
backwards,

00:26.092 --> 00:28.862
and when you get to ze
we'll go to sleep.

00:30.497 --> 00:35.235
It scares me that you won
be here when I wake up.

00:35.935 --> 00:39.672
No, I'm not going anywher
Start counting.

00:40.774 --> 00:42.042
Twenty.

00:43.510 --> 00:44.844
Nineteen.

00:44.911 --> 00:46.279
Eighteen.

00:47.247 --> 00:48.481
Seventeen.

00:49.983 --> 00:51.351
Sixteen.

00:52.318 --> 00:53.353
Fifteen.

00:54.120 --> 00:55.255
Fourteen.

00:56.156 --> 00:57.357
Thirteen.

00:58.858 --> 00:59.959
Twelve.

01:00.927 --> 01:01.995
Eleven.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.130
You can't stop counting.

01:04.998 --> 01:05.932
Ten.

01:09.569 --> 01:10.537
Eight.

01:11.171 --> 01:12.172
Seven.

01:13.540 --> 01:14.741
Six.

01:14.808 --> 01:16.042
Five.

01:17.477 --> 01:18.478
Four.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.218
-Tw
-Two.

01:27.420 --> 01:28.488
-On
-One.

03:11.958 --> 03:12.892
Indian...

03:13.793 --> 03:15.094
...do you know what it is?

03:24.437 --> 03:26.439
They're the savag
I told you about.

03:29.375 --> 03:30.443
They're near.

03:31.778 --> 03:33.913
Come. Let's go.

05:09.008 --> 05:11.010
Only take what's usef
for the combat.

05:11.511 --> 05:13.179
Fuses, gunpowder and weapons.

05:14.047 --> 05:15.081
Leave the rest.

06:43.369 --> 06:44.470
Do you know them?

06:46.172 --> 06:48.908
I'd like to bury the
at least those.

06:49.942 --> 06:51.244
God isn't here today.

06:51.944 --> 06:54.680
It makes no differen
if we bury them or not, Father.

06:54.747 --> 06:56.048
I'm no longer a Father.

06:58.551 --> 07:01.120
We're leavin
Portuguese, go on.

07:01.187 --> 07:02.422
The Dean is missing.

07:03.589 --> 07:05.725
They wouldn't have come he
without him.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.527
They took him alive.

07:08.394 --> 07:09.595
I couldn't care less.

07:11.497 --> 07:13.733
We could get lots of go
if we rescue him.

07:15.601 --> 07:17.770
They must have eaten h
already, Father.

07:19.505 --> 07:20.473
Let's go.

07:28.648 --> 07:31.717
Easy, buddy. Easy, easy, easy.

07:39.992 --> 07:42.728
Trébol, eas
Look at me, look at me.

07:43.129 --> 07:46.065
It'll soon be over, it'll so
be over, brother. Soon, soon.

07:47.767 --> 07:48.768
Soon.

07:56.576 --> 08:00.246
Breathe, breathe, ther
Breathe. There.

08:08.387 --> 08:10.423
Trébol, Trébol, Trébol, Trébol.

08:11.390 --> 08:13.993
Easy, easy, there, there.

08:14.060 --> 08:17.830
Brother... Trébol, Trébol.
Trébol.

08:20.666 --> 08:23.536
There, there, there.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.505
There, brother.

10:27.994 --> 10:29.328
-Everything's oka
-Yes.

10:30.696 --> 10:32.031
This shit is enormous.

10:32.698 --> 10:34.200
Did you find the exit?

10:34.266 --> 10:35.868
-N
-Where's Jackson?

10:36.802 --> 10:38.170
He's ahead. We split up.

10:39.939 --> 10:41.107
Jackson, do you copy?

10:44.010 --> 10:45.144
Jackson, do you copy?

10:51.617 --> 10:53.819
I can't copy shi
There's too much static.

10:55.955 --> 10:57.790
Four hours le
for the extraction.

11:00.126 --> 11:02.228
Get Jackso
and search for the exit.

11:02.294 --> 11:04.497
In the meantim
I'll reinforce the entry.

11:04.563 --> 11:06.766
Be caref
and report every 10 minutes.

11:45.404 --> 11:47.973
I'm sick and tired of eati
rats in this jungle.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.442
If only they were rats.

11:49.508 --> 11:51.577
These things are more hai
than rats.

11:52.411 --> 11:54.647
As hairy as portuguese women.

11:58.918 --> 12:00.019
How would you know?

12:05.224 --> 12:08.427
Is it true that they would p
a ransom for the Dean?

12:10.496 --> 12:12.431
Why don't you a
the excommunicated?

12:17.303 --> 12:19.371
Hey, is it true?

12:23.809 --> 12:24.777
How much?

12:26.712 --> 12:28.047
I don't know, but a lot.

12:28.114 --> 12:30.883
The Holy Mother Chur
has all the gold in the world.

12:30.950 --> 12:32.752
All the go
that they stole here.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.321
And your sins, Father?

12:35.688 --> 12:38.491
Wouldn't they mean somethi
when asking for a ransom?

12:47.032 --> 12:49.368
They wouldn't have to kn
that I was in it.

12:49.435 --> 12:52.138
I prefer a dead man's go
than that of a priest.

12:53.906 --> 12:55.407
What do you think, Tomás?

12:55.474 --> 12:58.043
How much gold have you earn
since we found you?

12:58.110 --> 13:00.780
Enough so you can end
like the ones we saw today?

13:02.214 --> 13:04.283
They were very you
and were ambushed.

13:04.350 --> 13:07.386
If they'd stayed on the lookou
it wouldn't have happened.

13:07.453 --> 13:10.055
How the hell do you kn
what happened to them?

13:10.122 --> 13:13.526
Because the fuses weren't l
and no savage was found dead.

13:13.592 --> 13:15.961
They didn't even become awa
of their death.

13:16.028 --> 13:18.998
I'm not going to die witho
taking six savages with me.

13:21.367 --> 13:22.835
For once, I agree with you.

13:22.902 --> 13:27.573
Well, you're idiots. We're n
talking about a brave death.

13:27.640 --> 13:31.944
We're saying that they massacr
forty, we're not even twelve,

13:32.011 --> 13:34.847
and not even all the go
in the world can change that.

13:39.718 --> 13:41.854
How long had you kno
that priest?

13:45.124 --> 13:46.458
A long time.

13:47.159 --> 13:48.661
We were in the same abbey.

13:53.899 --> 13:55.734
Who wants to
and get the priest?

14:04.243 --> 14:09.882
Well, Father, I hope the rans
helps us to enter Heaven.

14:11.417 --> 14:12.551
Or hell.

14:14.620 --> 14:15.588
Doc.

14:28.634 --> 14:29.602
There, there.

14:29.668 --> 14:30.603
Water.

14:38.277 --> 14:39.578
Easy, easy.

14:43.215 --> 14:44.250
Where are we?

14:46.518 --> 14:47.653
Can't you remember?

14:52.291 --> 14:53.525
What can you remember?

14:56.195 --> 14:59.098
We were in comb
and crossed a river.

15:00.266 --> 15:02.401
-And the
-I don't know.

15:03.302 --> 15:05.137
I started to feel sick.

15:13.946 --> 15:15.514
Pardo, Pardo.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.650
What's wrong with he
What's wrong?

15:17.716 --> 15:18.651
Castillo.

15:20.119 --> 15:22.354
-What's wrong, what's wron
-Hold here.

15:24.490 --> 15:25.991
Hey, hey, come on, come on.

15:26.058 --> 15:28.160
Take this off, take this off.

15:32.831 --> 15:35.034
Careful with her head.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.135
Hey.

15:36.602 --> 15:37.870
No, be careful.

15:39.171 --> 15:40.105
Pardo.

15:41.974 --> 15:44.076
Pardo, Pardo, Pardo.

15:49.581 --> 15:50.516
Pardo.

15:50.783 --> 15:51.817
Pardo, Pardo.

15:52.084 --> 15:53.218
Hey, hey, hey.

15:59.325 --> 16:00.259
I'm cold.

16:11.704 --> 16:14.440
You only ate the ration
Did you drink any water?

16:14.506 --> 16:15.874
We only had the rations.

16:15.941 --> 16:18.811
We took some water fr
the rivers, but sterilized it.

16:18.877 --> 16:20.012
And the insects?

16:20.646 --> 16:22.014
Was Pardo bitten by one?

16:22.081 --> 16:23.182
No, nothing, nothing.

16:26.752 --> 16:28.587
Hey, wake up, wake up.

16:28.654 --> 16:29.621
Trébol.

16:29.688 --> 16:31.790
I'm okay. Don't worry.

16:45.604 --> 16:47.272
The RECO ones, come with me.

16:47.339 --> 16:49.241
We'll reinforce the entr
Barragán.

16:49.308 --> 16:51.143
Help me get the Claymores ready.

16:54.046 --> 16:55.914
They went to lo
for a back entry.

16:55.981 --> 16:57.649
If they find it, we'll get out.

16:57.716 --> 17:00.085
We have less than 4 hou
for the extraction.

17:00.152 --> 17:01.086
Rojas, listen.

17:02.621 --> 17:04.857
We cannot get out of her
Rojas.

17:04.923 --> 17:08.961
If we do, they'll kill us al
so let's wait for backup.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.295
Let's stay put.

17:12.097 --> 17:13.999
Nobody is coming for us.

17:17.302 --> 17:18.237
Doc.

17:26.412 --> 17:27.546
How's Pardo?

17:28.414 --> 17:30.449
I inyected adrenaline into her.

17:30.516 --> 17:33.118
I haven't the shittiest id
of what's ailing her.

17:34.219 --> 17:35.421
Can we move her?

17:38.090 --> 17:40.159
Trébol, can you move?

17:41.827 --> 17:43.162
You'll have to help me.

17:43.228 --> 17:44.263
I'm ready.

17:48.267 --> 17:49.902
Listen carefully, you bastard.

17:49.968 --> 17:51.270
You're our Trébol,

17:52.037 --> 17:53.772
and you can't let me dow
got it?

17:54.706 --> 17:56.275
I'll get you out of this.

17:58.410 --> 17:59.311
Barragán...

18:00.412 --> 18:01.647
...you'll be my spotter.

18:01.713 --> 18:03.115
You'll look after my ass.

18:03.582 --> 18:04.550
Let's go.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.191
Light the fuses.

18:53.499 --> 18:54.433
Portuguese.

19:03.442 --> 19:06.278
Take this and have no mercy.

20:47.145 --> 20:48.247
It's poison.

25:11.676 --> 25:12.911
What's that dick?

25:22.787 --> 25:25.156
Can't copy you, Roja
There's too much static.

25:25.223 --> 25:26.224
I'm with Jackson.

25:28.727 --> 25:29.694
Damn crap.

25:30.395 --> 25:32.264
Can't copy you, Roja
but listen.

25:33.632 --> 25:34.933
I found a sinkhole.

25:35.600 --> 25:38.203
I think air comes through her
but we can't go up.

25:38.737 --> 25:40.138
There's also a structure.

25:43.275 --> 25:47.145
Can't copy you, Rojas. I
moving on. I left a lightmark.

26:49.574 --> 26:51.076
It belongs to the Dean.

27:01.152 --> 27:02.087
I'm going down.

27:05.490 --> 27:06.591
Who'll go with him?

27:08.560 --> 27:09.561
I'll go, sir.

27:10.328 --> 27:11.262
Not you.

27:12.998 --> 27:14.032
Gómez?

27:20.005 --> 27:21.840
Be very caref
with the grenades.

28:24.602 --> 28:25.570
What's this?

28:28.740 --> 28:29.674
There's water.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.977
I see water, I see water.

28:34.813 --> 28:36.181
Wait, wait.

28:43.922 --> 28:44.989
I'm going to jump.

29:54.492 --> 29:56.594
Track
They've been through here.

29:58.830 --> 29:59.764
Diego!

30:00.231 --> 30:02.700
We're fine. Come down!

30:05.036 --> 30:06.037
Let's go!

30:16.748 --> 30:19.250
I'll check your wou
and change the dressing.

30:19.317 --> 30:20.418
Whatever, Doc.

30:37.335 --> 30:38.469
That shit hurts.

30:39.370 --> 30:41.306
Yes, I know.

30:59.524 --> 31:00.491
Take it.

31:15.273 --> 31:16.307
I'm going to piss.

32:04.289 --> 32:05.657
They were digging here.

32:38.323 --> 32:40.758
Those motherfucke
nearly scared me to death.

32:40.825 --> 32:42.360
I'll see if there's an exit.

34:43.815 --> 34:45.216
I think there's movement.

35:11.476 --> 35:12.577
I'll go over there.

35:13.177 --> 35:14.112
Copy that.

35:47.044 --> 35:47.979
Pardo.

35:49.046 --> 35:49.981
Pardo.

35:58.689 --> 35:59.624
Where's Pardo?

36:01.058 --> 36:02.527
Where's Pardo, shithead?

36:02.593 --> 36:04.795
It wasn't my faul
it wasn't my fault.

36:20.912 --> 36:22.146
Let's get out of here.

36:26.217 --> 36:27.151
Who screamed?

36:27.652 --> 36:28.619
Julián!

36:28.686 --> 36:29.954
Where's my brother?

36:31.055 --> 36:32.190
Julián!

36:34.258 --> 36:35.293
Julián!

36:37.628 --> 36:38.763
Julián!

36:38.829 --> 36:39.830
Julián!

36:40.731 --> 36:41.799
Quickly.

36:41.866 --> 36:43.000
Julián!

36:47.972 --> 36:49.006
Julián!

36:53.978 --> 36:55.279
Hell, that came here!

37:11.162 --> 37:12.697
That shit is no longer here.

37:17.101 --> 37:18.035
Pardo!

37:23.708 --> 37:26.010
Doc, I need you to st
with Trébol.

37:26.944 --> 37:27.845
Go ahead.

37:27.912 --> 37:30.014
If something happens to hi
it's on you.

37:51.269 --> 37:52.236
Pardo!

38:08.119 --> 38:09.287
No!

38:11.889 --> 38:13.024
Julián!

38:16.027 --> 38:17.061
Julián!

38:36.547 --> 38:41.018
Shit. Let's get out of her
Quickly, quickly!

38:43.754 --> 38:44.689
Run!

39:01.806 --> 39:04.141
Do you copy? Does anyone copy?

39:11.882 --> 39:13.384
Quickly, quickly.

39:17.955 --> 39:19.090
There's no exit!

39:20.991 --> 39:22.293
All at the same time.

39:23.294 --> 39:24.929
No one is to leave the group.

40:20.317 --> 40:21.719
Antonio, come.

41:20.277 --> 41:21.645
Rojas, come.

42:15.933 --> 42:17.635
Castillo, Barragán, do you copy?

42:18.869 --> 42:19.803
Rojas, copy.

42:19.870 --> 42:22.673
You have to get out. The ca
is full of those fuckers.

42:28.245 --> 42:29.680
We have to get Trébol out.

42:33.551 --> 42:34.885
You have twenty minutes.

43:45.956 --> 43:46.890
Díaz.

43:47.791 --> 43:49.860
No more, motherfucker, no more.

43:49.927 --> 43:51.161
Light here.

44:37.808 --> 44:39.510
Rojas, it's clear.
