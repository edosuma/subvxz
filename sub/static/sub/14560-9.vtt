WEBVTT

00:01.369 --> 00:03.471
MAN: We are joined today
with friends

00:03.504 --> 00:07.141
as far away as China and as
nearby as Beverly Hills.

00:07.175 --> 00:09.277
It's an especially trying time.

00:09.310 --> 00:13.547
Financial crisis, Wall Street's
roller coaster ride.

00:13.581 --> 00:15.616
Instability of our friends
in the Mideast.

00:15.649 --> 00:18.186
I look forward
to a very productive

00:18.219 --> 00:20.554
and focused two days.

00:20.588 --> 00:22.123
I want to...

00:22.156 --> 00:23.724
(explosion)

00:23.757 --> 00:27.228
(tape rewinding)

00:27.261 --> 00:28.296
That's our suspect.

00:28.329 --> 00:31.399
A waiter
who was working the event.

00:31.432 --> 00:33.601
It's been an especially
trying time.

00:33.634 --> 00:37.105
Bomb squad found this digital
camera at ground zero.

00:37.138 --> 00:38.606
Second floor conference room.

00:38.639 --> 00:40.508
All right, so tell me
about the meeting.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.243
Global Enhancement
Organization.

00:42.276 --> 00:46.114
Goal is to support health,
science, save the wildlife.

00:46.147 --> 00:48.082
Already ran Hitchcock
here through Quantico.

00:48.116 --> 00:49.350
Nothing yet.

00:50.451 --> 00:51.619
DON:
What? Same guy?

00:51.652 --> 00:55.256
Mm-hmm. Look at
the time stamp.

00:55.289 --> 00:57.125
Five minutes
before the blast.

00:57.158 --> 00:58.292
No plates, no I.D.

00:58.326 --> 00:59.493
Like he knew it was coming.

00:59.527 --> 01:00.594
David?
Yeah?

01:00.628 --> 01:02.196
What have you
got, anything?

01:02.230 --> 01:03.397
Colby says no casualties.

01:03.431 --> 01:05.333
All right, so tell him to
focus on forensics, all right?

01:05.366 --> 01:07.135
All right, that's a det
cord with a delay fuse.

01:07.168 --> 01:08.336
So I'm thinking
a little bit of TNT

01:08.369 --> 01:09.303
with a dash
of ammonium nitrate.

01:09.337 --> 01:11.139
That's the same recipe
as Timothy McVeigh,

01:11.172 --> 01:12.640
just a whole lot smaller.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.175
-All right.
MAN: Agent Eppes?

01:14.208 --> 01:14.975
-Yeah.

01:15.008 --> 01:15.743
I'm told you're
the man in charge.

01:15.776 --> 01:16.644
Who are you?
-Uh, Brett Hanson.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.679
I own this building.
Look, these people

01:18.712 --> 01:19.813
were my responsibility.

01:19.847 --> 01:22.483
You have any leads?
Anything at all?

01:22.516 --> 01:23.617
Let me ask you
something.

01:23.651 --> 01:24.818
Any idea why

01:24.852 --> 01:26.187
someone would want
to video you guys?

01:26.220 --> 01:27.888
What do you mean?
-Hold on.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.224
Hey, Liz, show Mr.
Hanson that video.

01:30.258 --> 01:31.525
And make sure
he sees a doctor.

01:31.559 --> 01:32.326
David.

01:32.360 --> 01:34.362
Yeah?
-McVeigh was Army, right?

01:34.395 --> 01:36.264
Yeah, bronze star
in the Gulf War.

01:36.297 --> 01:37.265
DON:
That truck, get someone...

01:37.298 --> 01:40.568
Oscar, you find a reason
to stop that truck. Go.

01:40.601 --> 01:41.869
Oklahoma City, they found
multiple devices, right?

01:41.902 --> 01:43.237
Yeah.

01:43.271 --> 01:44.705
That second one
was a fake. Why?

01:44.738 --> 01:45.806
Copycat.

01:45.839 --> 01:48.242
Wouldn't necessarily
know that.

01:48.276 --> 01:49.843
Colby's still
in the building.

01:49.877 --> 01:50.911
Evacuate the building!
Get out!

01:50.944 --> 01:52.380
Get out of the building! Go!

01:52.413 --> 01:54.648
Colby! Colby!

01:54.682 --> 01:56.650
Get out!

01:56.684 --> 01:59.287
Evac now!
Boss's orders!

01:59.320 --> 01:59.887
COLBY:
All right, let's go!

01:59.920 --> 02:01.489
Let's go.

02:03.691 --> 02:05.793
DON: Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go!

02:05.826 --> 02:06.894
Get out now!

02:06.927 --> 02:07.895
Come on, get out!

02:07.928 --> 02:09.430
Go! Go! Move!

02:10.764 --> 02:12.766
(glass shattering)

02:24.945 --> 02:27.715
So secondary blasts
trashed the camera...

02:27.748 --> 02:30.184
but some digital
information survives.

02:30.218 --> 02:31.519
(sighing)
-Okay, good point.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.354
I'll go see Charlie.

02:33.387 --> 02:34.755
(siren wailing)

02:36.690 --> 02:39.227
All right, the Global
Enhancement Organization.

02:39.260 --> 02:41.695
COLBY:
Founded in 2000 with

02:41.729 --> 02:43.731
"The expressed notion
that you can

02:43.764 --> 02:45.333
make the world
a better place."

02:45.366 --> 02:46.767
DON: Well, look at this:
Brett Hanson,

02:46.800 --> 02:48.636
Dan Clement,
Laurence Jones,

02:48.669 --> 02:49.637
Pierre Winters.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.672
What, this is like the
billionaires boys' club.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.641
Yeah. And the amount of people
these guys pissed off,

02:53.674 --> 02:55.209
I mean,
anyone could be a target.

02:55.243 --> 02:56.677
That's theory number one.

02:56.710 --> 02:57.978
Justin Koppen?

02:58.011 --> 03:00.681
Yeah, the big-time
financier and arms dealer

03:00.714 --> 03:03.851
who's on the FBI watch list
for the train bombing in India.

03:03.884 --> 03:05.719
Why's a guy like that
gonna risk coming here

03:05.753 --> 03:07.255
to talk about global warming?

03:07.288 --> 03:08.789
COLBY:
Then there's theory number two.

03:08.822 --> 03:09.623
(mouse clicks)

03:09.657 --> 03:11.625
These guys say
that the GEO is just

03:11.659 --> 03:12.593
a front for
powerful businessmen

03:12.626 --> 03:14.628
who are trying to plan
the new world order.

03:14.662 --> 03:17.965
Blames them for everything from
rising gas prices to Katrina.

03:17.998 --> 03:19.567
(mouse clicks)

03:19.600 --> 03:20.601
Not a fan of ours.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.670
"Slaughter at Waco,"
"Massacre at Ruby Ridge,"

03:22.703 --> 03:24.605
"FBI: Fools Bureaucrats
and Idiots."

03:24.638 --> 03:27.308
Sounds like a motive to me.

03:27.341 --> 03:28.309
All right, so what?

03:28.342 --> 03:29.810
You-You blow up the GEO...

03:29.843 --> 03:32.446
Then wait for us to respond,
set off a second bomb,

03:32.480 --> 03:33.714
you got a two for one.

03:39.520 --> 03:40.754
118 degrees,

03:40.788 --> 03:43.657
19 minutes, 19 seconds.

03:43.691 --> 03:46.694
It's more than a location,
it's a landmark.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.796
Ladies and gentleman,

03:48.829 --> 03:50.531
Operation Tinseltown.

03:52.933 --> 03:55.503
Casualties are an expected part
of covert ops.

03:55.536 --> 03:56.804
Well, we can skip that part.

03:56.837 --> 03:58.806
At CalSci, the slide rule

03:58.839 --> 04:00.874
has always been mightier
than the sword.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.576
And I truly believe

04:02.610 --> 04:05.579
Friday night's prank
will be our finest hour.

04:05.613 --> 04:06.580
LIZ:
Well, I'd recommend

04:06.614 --> 04:07.881
coming in from the north side.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.983
I hear the cameras
have a blind spot.

04:10.017 --> 04:11.285
CHARLIE:
Excuse me, folks,

04:11.319 --> 04:13.487
while I show
this lovely FBI agent

04:13.521 --> 04:16.023
the, um, domino wave analysis
that we're all working on.

04:16.056 --> 04:17.691
Follow me.

04:17.725 --> 04:19.693
Two words everybody
needs to remember:

04:19.727 --> 04:21.729
Plausible deniability.

04:23.797 --> 04:24.998
We got two dead,

04:25.032 --> 04:26.033
both rescue workers.

04:26.066 --> 04:27.768
What about
that yellow truck?

04:27.801 --> 04:29.570
Pulled a Houdini on us. We're
running down a partial plate.

04:29.603 --> 04:32.039
And the employees?
-Everybody checks out,

04:32.072 --> 04:33.040
except for him.

04:33.073 --> 04:34.775
Catering company
has him I.D.'d

04:34.808 --> 04:35.809
as John Booth.

04:36.777 --> 04:37.911
Address: nonexistent.

04:37.945 --> 04:38.912
Let me guess.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.448
A loner who kept to himself.

04:40.481 --> 04:41.715
You don't tell a lot of people

04:41.749 --> 04:43.451
that you plan on blowing up
their building.

04:43.484 --> 04:44.352
What about the members?

04:44.385 --> 04:46.086
Took off like the
Jamaican track team.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.087
Trying to follow up.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.489
We're having
no luck so far.

04:48.522 --> 04:49.623
Here we go.

04:49.657 --> 04:52.393
Here's video from the security
camera in the courtyard.

04:52.426 --> 04:53.794
DON:
All right, so, uh...

04:53.827 --> 04:56.864
just run it through
facial I.D., right?

04:56.897 --> 04:58.432
LIZ:
Here's the video camera.

04:58.466 --> 05:00.801
Data was damaged
in a bomb blast.

05:00.834 --> 05:02.736
CHARLIE: Uh, this is the
California Pacific Club?

05:02.770 --> 05:04.505
I saw this on CNN.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.975
(audio fast-forwarding)

05:08.008 --> 05:09.843
The megahertz
electric field strength

05:09.877 --> 05:11.111
must have fried
this footage.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.546
Well, that's our suspect.

05:12.580 --> 05:13.647
We were hoping you might

05:13.681 --> 05:15.449
be able to
restore it.

05:15.483 --> 05:16.717
Department
of Traffic

05:16.750 --> 05:19.487
caught these,
if it helps you at all.

05:20.588 --> 05:21.889
You know,
this is great.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.757
Meaning you'll be able
to fix the video?

05:23.791 --> 05:24.992
No.

05:25.025 --> 05:27.795
But I will be able to test a
theory I've been reading about:

05:27.828 --> 05:29.663
forensic video
reconstruction.

05:29.697 --> 05:30.831
Imagine...

05:30.864 --> 05:32.132
An emperor penguin.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.101
Emperor penguins look identical,

05:34.134 --> 05:35.836
and they have
no fixed nest sites,

05:35.869 --> 05:39.740
so they have to rely solely on
vocal calls for identification.

05:39.773 --> 05:42.910
But with so many penguins
singing out at once,

05:42.943 --> 05:45.479
they have to rely on
multiple identifications

05:45.513 --> 05:46.880
to reach their families.

05:46.914 --> 05:49.550
An application of
forensic video reconstruction

05:49.583 --> 05:51.885
could scan videos from
all around the city

05:51.919 --> 05:54.021
from, uh, Caltrans, LAPD,

05:54.054 --> 05:56.056
to find multiple
positive identifications

05:56.089 --> 06:00.428
like, uh, car models,
um, images of the driver.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.796
Connect the dots
and track his movements.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.865
Nice finish.

06:08.135 --> 06:09.670
(beeping)

06:09.703 --> 06:10.871
Hey, bud.

06:10.904 --> 06:12.139
The yellow truck
was a dead end.

06:12.172 --> 06:15.042
Just some lookie-loo trying to
get his 15 minutes on YouTube.

06:16.677 --> 06:18.779
DAVID:
Nice to know the GEO is

06:18.812 --> 06:19.813
less popular than we are.

06:19.847 --> 06:23.116
COLBY:
37 sites, 37 nine balls.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.952
Most of the domain
names were registered

06:24.985 --> 06:26.554
under aliases
or anonymously.

06:26.587 --> 06:27.621
I mean, bottom line,
it's gonna

06:27.655 --> 06:28.756
take awhile to track
these guys down.

06:28.789 --> 06:31.759
Well, forensics on the bombs,
mostly amateur stuff.

06:31.792 --> 06:34.194
M.O. doesn't match any
organizations we have on file.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.029
That rules out
foreign terrorists.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.898
Or rule in any homegrown nut

06:37.931 --> 06:39.833
with a library card
or the Internet.

06:39.867 --> 06:40.801
Might also
explain why

06:40.834 --> 06:42.903
the first bomb
didn't kill anybody though.

06:42.936 --> 06:46.807
If this guy was trying to hurt
the GEO, or maybe even the FBI--

06:46.840 --> 06:48.175
he hasn't accomplished
either one yet.

06:48.208 --> 06:49.943
Which means he'll probably
try again.

06:54.014 --> 06:56.183
GEO's got an endowment
the size of Harvard.

06:56.216 --> 06:58.952
Yeah, did you see where they go
every year for their meetings?

06:58.986 --> 07:02.690
Like, St. Tropez,
Barcelona, Amalfi...

07:02.723 --> 07:04.057
Strictly BYOJ:

07:04.091 --> 07:05.659
Bring your own jet.

07:05.693 --> 07:08.696
Yeah, not very
green, huh?

07:08.729 --> 07:11.499
I heard GEO's head honcho just
got released from the hospital.

07:11.532 --> 07:12.500
Oh, yeah?

07:12.533 --> 07:14.935
Should we go
tag team him?

07:14.968 --> 07:18.038
Okay, so, I answered
your phone this morning,

07:18.071 --> 07:20.841
and I ended up in a conversation
with one Rabbi Berman...

07:20.874 --> 07:21.942
Oh.

07:21.975 --> 07:22.876
...so I just want
to make sure

07:22.910 --> 07:25.679
you don't end up
on the roof with a fiddle.

07:25.713 --> 07:26.847
Actually,
I don't think you can

07:26.880 --> 07:28.749
get on the roof
of my building, so...

07:32.152 --> 07:35.188
Don Eppes finds a shrink
and God in the same year.

07:35.222 --> 07:38.025
Can't wait to see
what happens next.

07:38.058 --> 07:41.228
Well, maybe there's some Jewish
equivalent for sainthood.

07:41.261 --> 07:43.263
You know,
when it comes to religion,

07:43.296 --> 07:45.198
I tend to agree
with Clarence Darrow.

07:45.232 --> 07:48.536
Fear of God isn't the beginning
of wisdom, it's the end.

07:50.671 --> 07:52.740
When I need guidance,
I turn to the law.

07:52.773 --> 07:55.108
It's been solving problems
for 4,000 years.

07:55.142 --> 07:57.044
Yeah, well, I'm not
sure what I'm after,

07:57.077 --> 07:59.479
but I don't think I'm gonna
find it in the penal code.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.115
We've got sex...

08:02.149 --> 08:05.052
politics, religion...

08:05.085 --> 08:06.153
Two out of three ain't bad.

08:09.256 --> 08:11.224
AMITA: According to my favorite
conspiracy Web site,

08:11.258 --> 08:14.595
GEO secretly
funds Al Qaeda.

08:14.628 --> 08:16.730
That's more
conspiracy nonsense.

08:16.764 --> 08:18.566
Which in some
instances--

08:18.599 --> 08:20.033
Iran Contra-- turns
out to be true.

08:20.067 --> 08:23.771
Yeah, and in most cases-- 9/11--
turns out not to be.

08:23.804 --> 08:25.673
LARRY (over radio):
Most conspiracy theories fail

08:25.706 --> 08:27.675
because they assume
that we humans act

08:27.708 --> 08:28.909
in a clear
and rational manner.

08:28.942 --> 08:29.710
AMITA (over radio):
Graham Allison

08:29.743 --> 08:32.012
called it
his rationality theorem.

08:32.045 --> 08:34.582
Pearl Harbor, for example--
FDR let it happen.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.216
He had evidence
an attack

08:36.249 --> 08:38.752
was imminent, but the Army
was looking for a sabotage,

08:38.786 --> 08:39.687
not an aerial assault.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.922
Of course, Paul McCartney
dying in 1966,

08:41.955 --> 08:43.924
being replaced by
a look-alike...

08:43.957 --> 08:45.959
that is, of course,
pure fact.

08:45.993 --> 08:46.794
What?

08:46.827 --> 08:48.562
LARRY: Oh, yeah.
Check out the cover

08:48.596 --> 08:49.563
of Abbey Road.

08:49.597 --> 08:50.898
The clues are all over it.

08:50.931 --> 08:53.233
We have our suspect's
last tracked position.

08:53.266 --> 08:55.302
Oh. Good.

08:55.335 --> 08:58.572
AMITA (over radio):
Looks like it's outside a house

08:58.606 --> 08:59.940
somewhere in the Valley.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.311
Mr. Hanson,
isn't this, like,

09:04.344 --> 09:05.879
the car James Dean
used to drive?

09:05.913 --> 09:07.615
Yeah. It's the same one
he got killed in.

09:07.648 --> 09:08.616
Oh.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.283
I run one of the biggest
hedge funds in America.

09:10.317 --> 09:12.986
I think
I'm more responsible

09:13.020 --> 09:14.287
than he was.

09:14.321 --> 09:16.657
ROBIN: A lot of your critics
would like to see

09:16.690 --> 09:18.125
this baby wrapped
around a tree.

09:18.158 --> 09:19.192
Mmm.

09:19.226 --> 09:20.661
Let's save ourselves
some time.

09:20.694 --> 09:24.031
GEO is not planning
a new world order.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.766
We did not fake
the moon landing.

09:25.799 --> 09:28.001
We do not have Osama bin
Laden tied up someplace

09:28.035 --> 09:29.036
with a red ball
in his mouth.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.972
Much as I would like
that last one to be true.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.140
So what do you do?

09:35.242 --> 09:37.244
Bring irrigation
to a village in Kenya.

09:37.277 --> 09:39.079
Help a 12-
year-old boy

09:39.112 --> 09:40.213
get a new leg.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.349
For every wacko you produce,

09:42.382 --> 09:43.984
I have three thankful mothers.

09:44.017 --> 09:45.085
And how about
Justin Koppen,

09:45.118 --> 09:46.620
the arms dealer?

09:46.654 --> 09:47.921
Mr. Koppen built

09:47.955 --> 09:49.923
an emergency room
on the West Bank.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.091
He's on your bad list,

09:51.124 --> 09:52.159
not mine.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.761
So who are your enemies?

09:53.794 --> 09:56.029
Every company I ever
bought and sold.

09:56.063 --> 09:57.931
Think you could
help us get a hold of

09:57.965 --> 09:59.733
the membership list of the GEO?

09:59.767 --> 10:01.635
GEO is a private
organization.

10:01.669 --> 10:03.637
That's why we have the
members that we do.

10:03.671 --> 10:05.038
But I'll make
some calls for you,

10:05.072 --> 10:07.074
see if I can't get you
some cooperation.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.010
CHARLIE:
So the program was able

10:10.043 --> 10:14.214
to positively I.D.
and capture over 70 images

10:14.247 --> 10:16.249
from various cameras
around the city.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.751
And when they're all

10:17.785 --> 10:20.153
edited together, it shows
our suspect's movements

10:20.187 --> 10:21.154
after he left the club.

10:21.188 --> 10:23.123
Let me see.

10:23.156 --> 10:24.658
(typing)

10:27.795 --> 10:30.798
"3456 Old Farm Road."

10:30.831 --> 10:32.032
DAVID:
"Roy McGill."

10:32.065 --> 10:35.903
Arrested in 2006 for threatening
the life of a federal agent.

10:35.936 --> 10:38.438
DOJ lists him as a person
of interest.

10:38.471 --> 10:41.709
He took five tours of the
Pentagon in three months.

10:41.742 --> 10:45.879
LIZ:
Used different names, disguises,

10:45.913 --> 10:47.915
but not exactly
Carlos the Jackal.

10:47.948 --> 10:49.883
DAVID: Those bombs were
planted by amateurs.

10:49.917 --> 10:52.953
LIZ: "Groups like the FBI and
GEO must be stopped

10:52.986 --> 10:54.287
(now over speaker):
by any means necessary."

10:54.321 --> 10:57.024
Graduated with a degree
in visual arts.

10:57.057 --> 11:00.027
Calls himself a "documentarian
specializing in

11:00.060 --> 11:02.262
films exposing the truth
about America."

11:02.295 --> 11:04.297
Since when do
film schools offer classes

11:04.331 --> 11:05.799
on how to blow up
buildings?

11:05.833 --> 11:07.467
Print out his work
and home address.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.669
(over speaker):
Colby and I will go pick him up.

11:19.212 --> 11:21.815
I am very proud
to be here today

11:21.849 --> 11:25.853
to talk to you
about the goals of the GEO.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.120
This is a difficult time...

11:27.154 --> 11:28.956
(audio rewinding)

11:30.523 --> 11:32.159
FBI. Don't do
anything stupid.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.962
(sing-songy): You're being
videotaped. I'm warning you.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.129
Hey, put that thing down.

11:36.163 --> 11:38.899
Help! Help!
They're going to kill me!

11:38.932 --> 11:40.033
We're not gonna kill you.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.368
What's going on in here?

11:41.401 --> 11:42.970
Ma'am, we're the FBI;
we need you to get into

11:43.003 --> 11:44.772
the other room-- you, too, guys.
-Randy, call the police.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.006
Yeah, Randy,
go call the police!

11:46.039 --> 11:47.808
(laughing):
Oh, yeah, fake badges!

11:47.841 --> 11:49.376
What, you don't think
I've seen The Departed?

11:49.409 --> 11:51.111
You guys are here
to execute me.

11:51.144 --> 11:52.079
Let me see that badge.

11:52.112 --> 11:53.013
Listen, the badge is real

11:53.046 --> 11:54.481
and so is the jail
you're gonna wind up in.

11:54.514 --> 11:55.382
Now get out of here!

11:55.415 --> 11:57.350
Scram! Move!

11:57.384 --> 11:59.252
Oh, you can scare them,
but you cannot scare me.

11:59.286 --> 12:02.455
I will not go peacefully.

12:02.489 --> 12:04.324
Will you go with pepper spray
in your face?

12:07.494 --> 12:08.728
Okay, hands behind my back,
right?

12:08.762 --> 12:13.400
Hey, Randy, Jenny, the new guy--
don't let my work be in vain!

12:13.433 --> 12:16.036
Yeah, don't let my work
be in vain!

12:16.069 --> 12:18.071
Attica! Attica!
Left or right?

12:18.105 --> 12:19.106
Right.
-Okay.

12:19.139 --> 12:20.908
ALAN:
Hello, hello?

12:20.941 --> 12:21.909
Hello?

12:21.942 --> 12:23.043
Dad? Dad?
-Hello? What?

12:23.076 --> 12:25.946
You have to wait for it to ring,
and then you answer it.

12:25.979 --> 12:27.948
No, I could swear
I heard someone,

12:27.981 --> 12:30.083
and party lines have been
gone since World War II.

12:31.151 --> 12:33.854
Hey, the Hollywood sign?

12:33.887 --> 12:35.255
What's this got
to do with math?

12:35.288 --> 12:37.324
We're helping out with this
year's CalSci prank.

12:37.357 --> 12:38.926
Pranks. (chuckles)
I loved pranks

12:38.959 --> 12:40.060
when was I was in college.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.028
Hey, listen to this.

12:41.061 --> 12:43.130
You know, one time,
we actually stuffed...

12:43.163 --> 12:44.431
...ten frat brothers
into a phone booth, right?

12:44.464 --> 12:47.835
Ten pounds of manure
into the Dean's car.

12:47.868 --> 12:49.502
And it was the Architectural
Society, for your information.

12:49.536 --> 12:50.470
Oh, uh, by the way,

12:50.503 --> 12:52.873
have you factored in the stress
on the metal

12:52.906 --> 12:53.874
in the existing
structure?

12:53.907 --> 12:55.375
No, not yet.

12:55.408 --> 12:57.244
I could be of help to you
on this.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.946
And besides,
it would be a good idea

12:58.979 --> 12:59.980
to have an adult presence,

13:00.013 --> 13:01.815
just in case
the police show up.

13:01.849 --> 13:02.950
(laughs) Thank you.

13:02.983 --> 13:06.053
The more I think about it,
you should take my place.

13:06.086 --> 13:07.988
I don't need
another blot on my record.

13:08.021 --> 13:09.990
Hey, blots?
I have plenty of those.

13:10.023 --> 13:12.492
Record?
-I told you about the time

13:12.525 --> 13:14.027
I got arrested, right?
-Arrested?

13:14.061 --> 13:15.195
No, you didn't.

13:15.228 --> 13:16.196
(chuckles)

13:16.229 --> 13:17.564
Oh.

13:17.597 --> 13:20.500
Well, I was at this
Pink Floyd concert,

13:20.533 --> 13:22.535
and the guy that I was with had
this joint,

13:22.569 --> 13:23.403
and, uh,

13:23.436 --> 13:27.340
there was this
undercover cop, and...

13:28.608 --> 13:30.477
It was actually

13:30.510 --> 13:31.478
a really funny story.

13:31.511 --> 13:32.946
Sounds hilarious.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.982
I guess you had to be there.

13:38.585 --> 13:41.221
I thought your goons were there
to kill me 'cause of what I did.

13:41.254 --> 13:42.322
We don't shoot people,
Mr. McGill.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.057
We prefer
to put them on trial.

13:44.091 --> 13:47.127
My exposГ© on Roswell did shine
an embarrassing light

13:47.160 --> 13:48.896
on the FBI...

13:48.929 --> 13:50.297
His exposГ© on Roswell.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.965
The Ruby Ridge film--
Ruby Ridge!

13:51.999 --> 13:53.901
You remember the film!

13:53.934 --> 13:55.903
I knew
it was too realistic--

13:55.936 --> 13:59.639
I knew it-- I shouldn't have
shot the recreations in Super 8.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.574
And the piece I did
on Hitler

14:01.608 --> 14:03.576
escaping to the Arctic
in a submarine--

14:03.610 --> 14:05.979
No good. Too real.

14:06.013 --> 14:08.581
Let's discuss your bombing of
the California Pacific Club.

14:10.017 --> 14:12.285
M-Me? B-Bomb?

14:12.319 --> 14:13.053
Yeah, you.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.988
Mm...

14:15.022 --> 14:16.189
You guys are crazy.

14:16.223 --> 14:18.091
Look, we got a
fake job

14:18.125 --> 14:20.193
application, we got video of you
leaving five minutes

14:20.227 --> 14:22.162
before the explosion.
You understand?

14:22.195 --> 14:24.131
Your face on
hidden video camera.

14:24.164 --> 14:25.398
Oh! You have my footage?!

14:25.432 --> 14:27.567
I really want to put this
on my Web site.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.036
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

14:29.069 --> 14:30.670
Which isn't exactly the alibi
of the year.

14:30.703 --> 14:35.308
Guys, I was trying
to expose the GEO cabal.

14:35.342 --> 14:39.012
Like they give a crap
about carbon footprints.

14:39.046 --> 14:40.347
Mm-mm-mm.

14:40.380 --> 14:46.519
They plan how the stock market
will perform,

14:46.553 --> 14:49.156
decide presidential elections,

14:49.189 --> 14:50.657
all right?

14:50.690 --> 14:52.525
Even who will win
the Super Bowl.

14:52.559 --> 14:53.994
How else do you think

14:54.027 --> 14:55.362
the Patriots lost last year,
hmm?

14:55.395 --> 14:56.663
16 and 0?

14:56.696 --> 14:59.099
And then lost?
Come on, people.

14:59.132 --> 15:00.700
Just tell me this: Why'd you
leave five minutes early?

15:00.733 --> 15:03.336
I think Hanson was onto me.

15:03.370 --> 15:06.006
All right.
-He knew I'd come back later.

15:06.039 --> 15:08.041
Can I get my footage back?

15:08.075 --> 15:10.677
Deadline for Sundance
is coming up.

15:10.710 --> 15:13.080
Bye, guys.

15:15.582 --> 15:19.152
Boy, McGill's got
some interesting theories:

15:19.186 --> 15:21.254
"George Bush is a Soviet spy.

15:21.288 --> 15:23.156
"Lincoln planned
his own assassination

15:23.190 --> 15:25.125
because he was gay."

15:25.158 --> 15:27.527
I didn't know Jim Morrison and
Marilyn Monroe were living

15:27.560 --> 15:29.196
on an island in the Caribbean.

15:29.229 --> 15:31.031
We should think about
taking a visit.

15:31.064 --> 15:34.167
This guy has everything here
but the Kennedy conspiracy.

15:34.201 --> 15:36.436
Even a nut knows by now
that Oswald acted alone.

15:36.469 --> 15:40.173
What, three shots in 4.8
seconds with a bolt action

15:40.207 --> 15:43.010
whose scope wasn't properly
aligned? Come on.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.211
He was U.S. military trained.

15:44.244 --> 15:46.546
Ballistics proved that the first
shot came from the front.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.048
Then there's the
whole paraffin test.

15:48.081 --> 15:49.182
Which is unreliable at best.

15:49.216 --> 15:51.551
Three hobos were arrested
right after the shooting,

15:51.584 --> 15:54.021
all clean-shaven
with new shoes.

15:54.054 --> 15:55.055
Maybe they read GQ.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.656
Bad news.
We're not finding much

15:56.689 --> 15:58.225
to link this guy to the bombing.

15:58.258 --> 16:00.127
No explosive residue?

16:00.160 --> 16:01.428
Not even a cigarette
and a match.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.163
Maybe he wiped
the place clean.

16:03.196 --> 16:06.499
Maybe, but then the air
would have explosive toxins,

16:06.533 --> 16:08.168
and that you can't
wipe clean.

16:08.201 --> 16:10.103
So maybe he assembled the bombs
somewhere else.

16:10.137 --> 16:12.572
We scanned McGill's car,
his clothes, his body--

16:12.605 --> 16:15.075
something would've
come up positive.

16:19.112 --> 16:22.049
It's not like I asked her
to convert, you know?

16:24.751 --> 16:27.154
What do you mean?
She made fun of you?

16:27.187 --> 16:28.621
Nah, you know, I don't know.

16:28.655 --> 16:33.193
It's just that whole thing of
wanting the same things.

16:33.226 --> 16:34.727
Yeah, so...

16:34.761 --> 16:37.764
I mean, what if she didn't want
the same things exactly?

16:37.797 --> 16:40.033
Well, that's what I'm saying--
I don't know, I just...

16:40.067 --> 16:41.168
Yeah, but you don't
understand.

16:41.201 --> 16:45.505
See, that's an important part
about a relationship.

16:47.174 --> 16:48.007
Nice shot.

16:48.041 --> 16:50.043
No, I mean, do you think
that your mother

16:50.077 --> 16:51.111
and I agreed
on everything?

16:51.144 --> 16:52.445
Not on your cooking,
that's for sure.

16:52.479 --> 16:53.546
(chuckling)

16:53.580 --> 16:55.215
No, she hated
my meat loaf.

16:55.248 --> 16:56.349
And she forced me

16:56.383 --> 16:58.151
to learn how
to make steak pizzaiola.

16:58.185 --> 17:00.653
That, I maintain,
is good for all of us.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.155
Yeah, but what you don't
understand is

17:02.189 --> 17:04.357
it's the differences
that make us stronger.

17:09.162 --> 17:10.497
LARRY:
You know, I think

17:10.530 --> 17:12.432
we're gonna need more green
light for this to work.

17:12.465 --> 17:16.136
I just can't believe that Amita
believes in conspiracy theories.

17:16.169 --> 17:17.304
Well, I mean,
there are incidents

17:17.337 --> 17:19.106
like the Black Sox scandal,
Watergate,

17:19.139 --> 17:21.341
that would seem
to validate Amita's point.

17:21.374 --> 17:22.809
The rifle Oswald used
had iron sights.

17:22.842 --> 17:23.943
He didn't need a scope.

17:23.976 --> 17:26.313
J. Edgar Hoover, prior to the
assassination, mind you,

17:26.346 --> 17:28.681
warned that there were
two Oswalds out there,

17:28.715 --> 17:31.284
based on files
discovered by the FBI.

17:31.318 --> 17:32.752
Right, and analysts
later proved

17:32.785 --> 17:35.288
that it was the same
handwriting, equaling one guy.

17:35.322 --> 17:38.191
H.L. Mencken said that "The
central belief of every moron

17:38.225 --> 17:40.193
"is that he is the victim of
a conspiracy

17:40.227 --> 17:42.329
"and that his failure
to get on is the fault

17:42.362 --> 17:43.730
of werewolves
on Wall Street."

17:43.763 --> 17:46.099
Wait a second, did you just call
me a moron?

17:46.133 --> 17:47.100
H.L. Mencken did.

17:47.134 --> 17:48.201
Mm.

17:50.237 --> 17:51.504
LARRY:
Ew...

17:51.538 --> 17:53.240
Well, let's hope

17:53.273 --> 17:55.775
that Mencken was wrong
about the werewolf part.

17:55.808 --> 17:56.709
Howard Hunt's deathbed
confession--

17:56.743 --> 17:58.611
He said that Kennedy
was having an affair

17:58.645 --> 18:00.180
with the wife of a CIA agent.

18:00.213 --> 18:02.549
Named Cord Meyer, who divorced
his wife in '58,

18:02.582 --> 18:04.184
and the affair
started in '62.

18:04.217 --> 18:05.652
What else you got?

18:09.289 --> 18:10.457
ALAN:
I don't know.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.192
The telephone
repairman never came.

18:12.225 --> 18:13.660
What's wrong with it?

18:13.693 --> 18:16.863
Just the... there's
a bunch of weird noises.

18:16.896 --> 18:19.632
What,
like it's being tapped?

18:19.666 --> 18:21.334
Well, you were under
investigation, you know?

18:22.735 --> 18:24.171
Dad, did you leave
the door open?

18:24.204 --> 18:26.673
No.

18:26.706 --> 18:29.542
All right,
don't touch anything.

18:29.576 --> 18:32.279
I knew that phone
was being tapped.

18:42.689 --> 18:44.224
DON:
Yeah, all right, good.

18:44.257 --> 18:47.227
So Charlie's office and
David's car were also hit.

18:47.260 --> 18:48.795
Well, they didn't
break the door.

18:48.828 --> 18:51.331
Dad, I think
we're dealing with pros here.

18:51.364 --> 18:52.332
Some pros.

18:52.365 --> 18:53.766
They didn't take the LCD

18:53.800 --> 18:55.235
or your grandmother's
silverware.

18:55.268 --> 18:56.869
Well, they weren't after
any of that stuff.

18:56.903 --> 18:58.505
What do you think
they were after?

18:58.538 --> 19:00.307
Something to do
with the case.

19:00.340 --> 19:01.808
They were in
your brother's office.

19:01.841 --> 19:05.245
What if they didn't find
what they were looking for?

19:05.278 --> 19:07.880
It's just weird that
they left my work alone.

19:07.914 --> 19:09.816
You know what's
really weird?

19:09.849 --> 19:13.686
Is this place looks cleaner now
than it did before the burglary.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.555
Well, they passed through
the triple security

19:15.588 --> 19:16.689
with relative ease.

19:16.723 --> 19:18.558
LIZ:
Yeah, which means...?

19:18.591 --> 19:20.193
Let me put it to you this way:

19:20.227 --> 19:23.663
You know the laser guidance
system the Army uses

19:23.696 --> 19:24.831
for smart bombs?

19:24.864 --> 19:26.466
We use the same
encryption.

19:26.499 --> 19:27.500
What was on there?

19:27.534 --> 19:29.269
Just some of my work
on representation theory.

19:29.302 --> 19:30.803
But, you know,
my work with the FBI

19:30.837 --> 19:31.804
is well-documented.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.573
So maybe they were
looking for

19:33.606 --> 19:35.675
a backdoor
into classified files.

19:35.708 --> 19:39.746
Well, whoever did this hit your
office, house and David's car.

19:39.779 --> 19:41.348
Pretty thorough.

19:41.381 --> 19:43.683
Hey, there you've got
your classic Venn diagram.

19:43.716 --> 19:44.551
You figure out
where

19:44.584 --> 19:46.719
these sets overlap
and you will know

19:46.753 --> 19:47.754
what they were looking for.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.565
Larry says it's
like a Venn diagram.

19:58.598 --> 20:01.501
Charlie's office and house.

20:01.534 --> 20:02.902
Makes you think
they're after something of his.

20:02.935 --> 20:05.838
Yeah, but the break-in
in David's car doesn't fit.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.740
Where were you guys
prior to that?

20:07.774 --> 20:08.875
We arrested McGill.

20:08.908 --> 20:09.676
You took him in?

20:09.709 --> 20:11.511
No.
I mean, we called in a unit.

20:11.544 --> 20:12.745
We didn't want to waste time
processing him.

20:12.779 --> 20:14.714
Don wanted us to toss the house.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.816
So any evidence
you collected

20:16.849 --> 20:19.452
from McGill's documentary would
have been in David's car.

20:19.486 --> 20:20.753
Yeah, but there wasn't
anything new there.

20:20.787 --> 20:22.589
I mean, it was just
old footage of Hanson.

20:22.622 --> 20:24.791
Yeah, but a burglar wouldn't
have known that.

20:24.824 --> 20:28.361
Yeah.
So they're after the videotape.

20:28.395 --> 20:30.029
ROBIN: You know,
for a guy in charge,

20:30.062 --> 20:32.799
Hanson hasn't gotten us very far
on the GEO guest list.

20:32.832 --> 20:35.268
On the other hand, McGill
may not be so crazy.

20:35.302 --> 20:36.769
Okay,

20:36.803 --> 20:39.272
he's crazy, but that doesn't
mean that he's wrong.

20:39.306 --> 20:40.807
I've managed to I.D.

20:40.840 --> 20:43.843
19 members off
anti-GEO Web sites.

20:43.876 --> 20:45.878
Look at the company profiles.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.514
Between their
factories,

20:47.547 --> 20:48.948
they're exploiting half
the children in China.

20:48.981 --> 20:50.883
Hey, Charlie,

20:50.917 --> 20:52.319
where do you keep
your work on McGill?

20:52.352 --> 20:53.820
My laptop, of course.

20:53.853 --> 20:56.789
The processing speed for this
algorithm was relatively low.

20:56.823 --> 20:59.359
Did you have it
with you last night?

20:59.392 --> 21:01.761
Why? You think this
is what the burglars were after?

21:01.794 --> 21:02.895
The video here?

21:02.929 --> 21:05.031
I must have watched it ten times
before it was destroyed.

21:05.064 --> 21:06.833
Just the backs of
a bunch of guys' heads

21:06.866 --> 21:09.702
and Hanson talking
about falling yen.

21:09.736 --> 21:11.838
Okay. Let's say the same
guy who set the bombs

21:11.871 --> 21:14.006
also orchestrated
the break-ins.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.842
I mean, he found out
we had the tape,

21:15.875 --> 21:17.644
and wanted to make sure
we couldn't be I.D.'d.

21:17.677 --> 21:20.079
So we're saying that the burglar
and the bomber are the same guy.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.881
Except David
said that

21:21.914 --> 21:23.383
the bombs were
purely amateur hour,

21:23.416 --> 21:24.784
and these break-ins
are all high-end jobs.

21:24.817 --> 21:27.320
Okay, so we're saying that
the burglar and the bomber

21:27.354 --> 21:28.821
aren't the same guy.

21:28.855 --> 21:30.790
Which does mean
that someone in the GEO

21:30.823 --> 21:32.425
wants to keep
his identity a secret.

21:32.459 --> 21:33.493
Who has the most to lose?

21:33.526 --> 21:34.727
We don't know yet.

21:34.761 --> 21:36.463
Maybe you do.

21:36.496 --> 21:37.730
Simpson's Paradox.

21:37.764 --> 21:38.731
I love that show.

21:38.765 --> 21:40.933
Not Homer. Edward.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.835
Edward Simpson.

21:42.869 --> 21:45.538
You see,
in both these years,

21:45.572 --> 21:47.907
David Justice had
a higher batting average

21:47.940 --> 21:50.577
than Derek Jeter.

21:50.610 --> 21:53.913
But, if you factor in
their uneven number of at-bats,

21:53.946 --> 21:56.416
Jeter beats him.

21:56.449 --> 21:59.952
That doesn't mean that Jeter's
the better hitter either year.

21:59.986 --> 22:01.721
Right. You go with what you
know, not with what you don't.

22:01.754 --> 22:04.457
The guy we can identify.
Hanson.

22:07.860 --> 22:11.631
New World Order?
Cabal of Villains?

22:11.664 --> 22:13.700
Do you really think
that I'm responsible

22:13.733 --> 22:14.901
for these burglaries?
-We're just saying

22:14.934 --> 22:17.036
you seemed a little nervous
about the tape getting out,

22:17.069 --> 22:17.870
so why don't you

22:17.904 --> 22:19.639
tell us what
happened at the meeting?

22:19.672 --> 22:21.641
That's privileged information
for members only.

22:21.674 --> 22:22.775
They pay me to keep secrets.

22:22.809 --> 22:24.911
You're on a fishing trip.

22:24.944 --> 22:27.113
And we usually hook a big one,
so let's not

22:27.146 --> 22:28.548
waste time here.

22:28.581 --> 22:29.882
I can
subpoena GEO's records.

22:29.916 --> 22:31.618
I'm incorporated
in Monte Carlo,

22:31.651 --> 22:33.453
and I have President Sarkozy's
private number.

22:33.486 --> 22:34.787
You have
that much time?

22:34.821 --> 22:36.989
Really?
-I do. Really.

22:37.023 --> 22:38.425
Then let's at least

22:38.458 --> 22:40.993
hope you find
the bomber by then.

22:41.027 --> 22:42.995
It still amazes me
that there are people

22:43.029 --> 22:46.466
that think that crime
is an acceptable way of life.

22:46.499 --> 22:47.834
Well, you'd
be surprised

22:47.867 --> 22:49.902
what the human mind
can rationalize.

22:49.936 --> 22:51.604
Just ask Dostoevsky.

22:51.638 --> 22:53.072
Or Amita.

22:53.105 --> 22:56.776
It was a misdemeanor.
I paid a fine and went home.

22:56.809 --> 22:58.878
And not with my date,
for the record.

22:58.911 --> 23:01.047
Yeah, well,
who hasn't had that happen?

23:01.080 --> 23:03.950
I'm just surprised
you never mentioned it.

23:03.983 --> 23:05.084
I can't tell
you everything

23:05.117 --> 23:06.619
that's ever happened
in my entire life.

23:06.653 --> 23:08.154
Why not?

23:08.187 --> 23:09.989
Because, first of all,
it's not all that interesting.

23:10.022 --> 23:12.892
Let me be the judge
of that, all right?

23:12.925 --> 23:17.764
I'm late for my
random matrix theory lecture.

23:17.797 --> 23:20.733
Is he being a little dramatic,
or is it just me?

23:22.569 --> 23:24.971
You think I'm wrong.

23:28.174 --> 23:30.810
Didn't seem like a big deal,

23:30.843 --> 23:33.913
but maybe I should
have said something.

23:37.484 --> 23:41.521
Charlie's life has always been
an open book, you know?

23:41.554 --> 23:44.591
His family issues,
his personal problems.

23:44.624 --> 23:46.659
Maybe you're right.

23:48.628 --> 23:50.563
I really appreciate
the insight.

23:50.597 --> 23:53.933
It's a good talk, Larry.

23:53.966 --> 23:55.434
Thanks.

23:56.903 --> 23:59.438
No, I'm good.
I can finish up in here.

24:30.903 --> 24:32.138
(screams)

24:32.171 --> 24:33.606
Calm down.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.207
We're not going
to hurt you.

24:35.241 --> 24:36.976
I know who
did the bombing.

24:37.009 --> 24:39.045
I have the proof.

24:39.078 --> 24:41.981
The man leaves
no stone unturned.

24:42.014 --> 24:44.851
Okay, okay, so I didn't tell you
guys about the second camera,

24:44.884 --> 24:47.820
but...

24:47.854 --> 24:49.221
I need you to protect me.

24:49.255 --> 24:50.890
Don't worry--
contrary to your

24:50.923 --> 24:53.526
Web site, we are
pretty good at our jobs, so...

24:53.560 --> 24:55.094
(gunshots)
DAVID: Down! Down! Down!

24:55.127 --> 24:58.064
This is what happened
in Waco!

24:58.097 --> 25:00.199
DAVID & COLBY:
Shut up!

25:02.969 --> 25:03.903
I've got nothing.

25:06.138 --> 25:08.541
(gunshots)

25:08.575 --> 25:11.177
All right,
I gotta get a line of sight.

25:11.210 --> 25:13.913
Move. Stay back.

25:18.985 --> 25:20.820
Rooftop, 1:00.

25:22.922 --> 25:24.156
We're about to move.

25:24.190 --> 25:25.992
You stay with me.
-All right.

25:26.025 --> 25:27.159
All right-- three,

25:27.193 --> 25:28.861
two,

25:28.895 --> 25:30.863
one.

25:30.897 --> 25:32.899
DAVID:
Come on.

25:32.932 --> 25:33.966
DAVID:
Move!

25:38.037 --> 25:41.674
"Treason doth never prosper."
Hmm?

25:41.708 --> 25:43.242
The generals who sent Dreyfus
to Devil's Island

25:43.275 --> 25:44.777
were honorable men.

25:44.811 --> 25:46.145
Shh!

25:46.178 --> 25:48.748
(whispering):
Do you know

25:48.781 --> 25:50.249
that the limousine

25:50.282 --> 25:51.851
was cleaned
right outside the hospital.

25:51.884 --> 25:55.755
Life magazine
shows a bucket of water

25:55.788 --> 25:57.223
and a sponge

25:57.256 --> 25:58.891
(voice gets louder):
right next to the car-- why?

25:58.925 --> 26:01.027
To destroy the
evidence, of course.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.996
The Kennedy assassination
was a coup, plain and simple.

26:04.030 --> 26:05.197
Shh!

26:05.231 --> 26:08.167
(whispering):
Shh! Let's do this thing.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.369
Just stay here, okay?
-Yeah...

26:10.402 --> 26:12.238
So you don't get hurt
before you finish.

26:12.271 --> 26:14.573
Yeah. All right.

26:25.117 --> 26:26.753
What the hell is this?

26:26.786 --> 26:29.021
L.A.H.!

26:29.055 --> 26:32.191
Live Action Hunting. Ooh!

26:32.224 --> 26:33.259
Don't touch it!

26:33.292 --> 26:34.794
You set up
a remote control,

26:34.827 --> 26:37.964
you can fire via laptop
from anywhere in the world.

26:37.997 --> 26:38.898
Watch yourself, buddy.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.166
Oh, don't worry about me.
I won't fall.

26:40.199 --> 26:41.333
If I push you, you will.

26:41.367 --> 26:44.270
Pretty cool.

26:44.303 --> 26:46.906
Dude wasn't up here.
Wanted to trick you guys.

26:46.939 --> 26:50.810
No. He wanted to distract us.

26:50.843 --> 26:52.378
My camera!

26:57.950 --> 26:59.719
Gone.

26:59.752 --> 27:01.220
Son of a bitch is good.

27:01.253 --> 27:04.123
There goes our chance
of getting the bomber on tape.

27:04.156 --> 27:06.158
Not necessarily.

27:07.994 --> 27:10.997
This one had the best angle,

27:11.030 --> 27:12.298
and a stronger
housing.

27:15.702 --> 27:17.670
MCGILL:
Camera was on a time delay,

27:17.704 --> 27:19.205
motion sensor.

27:21.741 --> 27:22.942
What you're seeing right now,
this is...

27:22.975 --> 27:25.912
everything here
is from the night before.

27:30.149 --> 27:32.284
LIZ: Should be clear enough
for a jury.

27:32.318 --> 27:34.320
ROBIN: How long to run him
through facial recognition?

27:34.353 --> 27:36.155
Well, it depends
on what databases he's in.

27:36.188 --> 27:39.892
(clears throat)
You don't have to.

27:39.926 --> 27:41.160
May I?
-Mm-hmm.

27:43.930 --> 27:46.766
LIZ: Jeff Jonze. White Alliance.
You know him?

27:46.799 --> 27:49.702
Blames the blacks and the Jews
for the downfall of America.

27:49.736 --> 27:52.038
Guy's a real nut.

27:52.071 --> 27:56.042
He gives us civic investigators
a bad name.

27:56.075 --> 27:57.109
Everyone hates him.

28:06.052 --> 28:07.319
So what do you
want to do now?

28:07.353 --> 28:08.320
I don't know.

28:08.354 --> 28:10.022
I'm pretty drunk.

28:10.056 --> 28:12.491
Maybe go home and take care
of my other problem.

28:12.524 --> 28:13.692
(laughing)

28:19.431 --> 28:21.267
FBI!
Let me see your hands!

28:21.300 --> 28:23.903
COLBY: Hands!
Let me see those hands!

28:38.885 --> 28:40.719
Everybody down! Stay down!

28:41.988 --> 28:44.957
Can you move?
Okay. Then go. Come on.

29:00.439 --> 29:01.974
(man grunts)

29:05.077 --> 29:06.478
(man moaning)

29:10.149 --> 29:11.517
What the hell happened?
You okay?

29:11.550 --> 29:13.085
Yeah.

29:13.119 --> 29:15.321
Guy just saved my life.

29:25.364 --> 29:26.966
DAVID:
I don't think it's a big deal.

29:26.999 --> 29:29.836
I guess you're right.
It's just, uh...

29:29.869 --> 29:31.370
Look at your brother.

29:31.403 --> 29:33.272
That man dated
an ATF agent,

29:33.305 --> 29:35.908
an FBI agent,
now an AUSA.

29:35.942 --> 29:38.044
Three women,
all packing heat.

29:38.077 --> 29:39.411
You can sleep on that.

29:39.445 --> 29:41.180
COLBY: Just a shadow.
That's all we got.

29:41.213 --> 29:42.949
It's like looking
at a comic book.

29:42.982 --> 29:44.416
DAVID:
Lab results are back.

29:44.450 --> 29:47.019
Bomb residue all over
Jonze's apartment,

29:47.053 --> 29:47.987
and under his fingernails.

29:48.020 --> 29:51.490
ERT found this
in his apartment-- 50 grand.

29:51.523 --> 29:53.259
I guess his reasons
for the bombing

29:53.292 --> 29:54.426
were financial,
not political.

29:54.460 --> 29:55.928
Jonze's background,

29:55.962 --> 29:58.998
it does make for the perfect
cover, you know.

29:59.031 --> 30:01.233
Don't even say it.
-He was a patsy.

30:02.134 --> 30:03.302
Any prints?

30:03.335 --> 30:04.904
Yeah, we pulled two sets.

30:04.937 --> 30:06.605
They're both latent.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.107
The first ones
match Jonze;

30:08.140 --> 30:09.876
second ones no-go.

30:09.909 --> 30:11.143
CHARLIE: You know,
fingerprints can reveal

30:11.177 --> 30:12.178
more than a person's identity.

30:12.211 --> 30:13.880
They can tell us
what he touched.

30:13.913 --> 30:16.916
You think anyone around
here might have a, uh,

30:16.949 --> 30:18.484
a book of matches?

30:20.586 --> 30:24.523
Desorption electrospray
ionization.

30:24.556 --> 30:27.459
Any substance heated
enough will emit

30:27.493 --> 30:31.563
unique spectral lines
in a specific color.

30:31.597 --> 30:33.399
For instance,
a fireworks display,

30:33.432 --> 30:36.602
where every explosive
has a signature display

30:36.635 --> 30:37.937
and color pattern.

30:37.970 --> 30:39.538
The Crossette, which contains

30:39.571 --> 30:41.540
several large
gold and silver stars.

30:41.573 --> 30:43.475
The Kamuro is a dense burst,

30:43.509 --> 30:45.411
which leaves a heavy,
red glitter trail.

30:45.444 --> 30:47.880
Each substance
on a human fingerprint

30:47.914 --> 30:50.917
also burns at a specific
color temperature

30:50.950 --> 30:52.551
revealing
its chemical property--

30:52.584 --> 30:55.187
i.e. acetate, mercury, water.

30:55.221 --> 30:58.190
I can run this print through
CalSci's mass spectrometer,

30:58.224 --> 30:59.625
compare those results

30:59.658 --> 31:02.028
to EPA reports, and look
for chemical matches

31:02.061 --> 31:03.930
based on geography.

31:03.963 --> 31:05.031
Narrow down
where this guy lives.

31:06.198 --> 31:08.167
LIZ:
Higher cheek bones.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.636
So, Jonze spent his last day
visiting a prostitute

31:10.669 --> 31:12.471
and his buddy in prison.

31:12.504 --> 31:14.140
Two different
stops, I hope.

31:14.173 --> 31:16.675
COLBY: Yeah. So the cell phone
dump led us nowhere,

31:16.708 --> 31:18.978
which leads me
to "waiting on Charlie" time.

31:19.011 --> 31:20.112
MCGILL:
That the, uh...

31:20.146 --> 31:21.180
guy who smoked Jonze?

31:21.213 --> 31:24.683
Leaner and, uh,
more hollow eyes.

31:24.716 --> 31:25.952
Jonze had it coming.

31:25.985 --> 31:28.020
Me and my buddy,
Loch Ness 007,

31:28.054 --> 31:31.023
we used to see him at protests,
and he always wanted to, like,

31:31.057 --> 31:32.992
you know, just
start fights with us.

31:33.025 --> 31:33.960
Even wanted
to do a film

31:33.993 --> 31:35.962
on him, but nobody...
nobody had the guts.

31:35.995 --> 31:38.097
Yeah, something
like him.

31:38.130 --> 31:39.431
(gasps):
Oh, my God!

31:39.465 --> 31:42.634
MCGILL: Yeah. You know
who that is?

31:42.668 --> 31:46.005
Howard freakin' Hughes
saved your life.

31:47.073 --> 31:51.077
Howard Hughes is dead.

31:51.110 --> 31:54.213
Suspect opens his mouth,
it's automatically a lie?

31:54.246 --> 31:55.714
Hm?

31:55.747 --> 31:58.150
Read it in
the New York Times,

31:58.184 --> 31:59.218
and ooh, it's gospel.

31:59.251 --> 32:01.220
All right, it does kind of
look like Howard Hughes.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.362
How's it going?

32:10.396 --> 32:11.697
Good.

32:11.730 --> 32:14.100
The computer's prioritizing
the geography right now.

32:14.133 --> 32:15.201
I brought you a peace offering.

32:15.234 --> 32:16.702
What do you mean,
peace offering?

32:16.735 --> 32:18.004
I'm not mad at you.

32:20.072 --> 32:20.872
Just take it.

32:20.906 --> 32:22.941
I started writing it
when I was 13.

32:25.011 --> 32:26.345
I can't read this.

32:26.378 --> 32:27.980
This is personal.

32:28.014 --> 32:31.117
I don't have any secrets
from you, Charlie.

32:33.185 --> 32:34.420
That's kind of nice,

32:34.453 --> 32:37.189
not being the one
to apologize.

32:37.223 --> 32:38.390
(computer beeps)

32:39.458 --> 32:41.060
That's interesting.

32:43.129 --> 32:45.364
All right, so this
is a list of substances

32:45.397 --> 32:47.133
we found
on the suspect's finger.

32:47.166 --> 32:49.168
We were able to match
the most unique properties

32:49.201 --> 32:50.102
to their
indigenous areas.

32:50.136 --> 32:52.738
Parkway trees,
levels of sulfur dioxide,

32:52.771 --> 32:54.506
the pH value of the soil

32:54.540 --> 32:56.175
led me to Hancock Park.

32:56.208 --> 32:58.677
We got nitromethane.

32:58.710 --> 32:59.745
That's an organic
compound widely used

32:59.778 --> 33:02.481
in the manufacture
of pesticides and explosives.

33:02.514 --> 33:05.317
So whoever paid Jonze must
have handled the bombs.

33:05.351 --> 33:07.186
CHARLIE: Yeah, that's
what we assumed,

33:07.219 --> 33:09.321
but we didn't find any matches
at the crime scene.

33:09.355 --> 33:12.724
What we did find a match to,
oddly enough, is, uh, methanol.

33:12.758 --> 33:14.560
Racing fuel?

33:14.593 --> 33:16.095
That's funny-- Hanson
races cars, but, I mean,

33:16.128 --> 33:17.529
why is a guy gonna blow
up his own meeting?

33:20.299 --> 33:23.335
Where's the rendering
of Hanson's club?

33:23.369 --> 33:27.539
I want to see the forensic
blast pattern.

33:27.573 --> 33:28.774
All right, now,

33:28.807 --> 33:33.512
first bomb,
that cleared the building.

33:33.545 --> 33:35.381
Bomb number two hit one of

33:35.414 --> 33:37.416
the three main
load-bearing girders.

33:37.449 --> 33:38.350
Bomb number three...

33:38.384 --> 33:43.055
and number four
damaged the remaining two.

33:43.089 --> 33:45.157
Whoever set those bombs
meant to collapse that building,

33:45.191 --> 33:47.493
or at least guarantee
that it had to be torn down.

33:49.728 --> 33:51.263
I think we can
do better.

33:51.297 --> 33:52.531
I think the top floor
needs some work.

33:52.564 --> 33:54.233
Mr. Hanson.

33:54.266 --> 33:56.235
You have an appointment?

33:56.268 --> 33:58.137
Guys, you want to give us
a minute here? FBI.

33:58.170 --> 33:59.338
Thanks.

33:59.371 --> 34:01.140
You should take
a look at these.

34:01.173 --> 34:02.374
"Los Angeles

34:02.408 --> 34:04.143
Landmark and Preservation
Society."

34:04.176 --> 34:05.344
COLBY:
We found the blueprints

34:05.377 --> 34:07.213
you filed with the city office--

34:07.246 --> 34:08.547
or rather,
your offshore account filed,

34:08.580 --> 34:11.450
under the guise of
a nonprofit organization.

34:11.483 --> 34:13.285
We know you fought
unsuccessfully, three years ago,

34:13.319 --> 34:14.853
to have the status
of your building

34:14.886 --> 34:16.655
taken off the landmark list.

34:16.688 --> 34:17.656
I think you've been reading

34:17.689 --> 34:20.259
those conspiracy Web pages
a little too much.

34:20.292 --> 34:23.162
I'm no expert,
but my guess is, a high-rise

34:23.195 --> 34:25.164
at this location's got to fetch
at least, what,

34:25.197 --> 34:26.198
$300, $400 million?

34:26.232 --> 34:27.133
Clearly, you couldn't

34:27.166 --> 34:29.401
get it town down,
so you had it blown up.

34:29.435 --> 34:30.836
You're gonna have to do
better than that.

34:30.869 --> 34:32.171
COLBY:
No problem.

34:32.204 --> 34:33.372
Here you go.

34:36.175 --> 34:39.311
Let me see those hands.

34:39.345 --> 34:40.812
Let's go.

34:46.152 --> 34:47.819
LIZ:
How'd you get that photo?

34:47.853 --> 34:50.889
Turns out Loch Ness 007 has
bigger cojones than I thought.

34:50.922 --> 34:51.890
(clears throat)

34:51.923 --> 34:53.559
He was secretly
filming Jonze

34:53.592 --> 34:55.627
when he spotted him
having drinks with Hanson.

34:55.661 --> 34:58.430
Loch Ness was about
to break a... huge story

34:58.464 --> 35:01.800
on GEO starting
a new Hitler Youth Center.

35:01.833 --> 35:03.435
Well...

35:03.469 --> 35:04.870
there goes his exclusive.

35:07.173 --> 35:08.640
Tell him not to be
too upset-- I mean,

35:08.674 --> 35:10.509
that photo will send Hanson
to jail for the rest

35:10.542 --> 35:11.577
of his life.

35:11.610 --> 35:15.314
We, um, you know,
we could really use your insight

35:15.347 --> 35:18.217
on the Kennedy assassination.

35:18.250 --> 35:20.452
I'll make you a gold circle
member of my group.

35:20.486 --> 35:22.454
DAVID:
I'm with Groucho Marx.

35:22.488 --> 35:24.190
If that's who's asking,
I'm not joining.

35:24.223 --> 35:25.457
Oh. Uh-huh, uh-huh, okay.

35:25.491 --> 35:27.226
Ooh, go ahead,
make fun of me.

35:27.259 --> 35:30.296
But I was right about
the GEO members.

35:30.329 --> 35:31.697
Those are bad guys.

35:31.730 --> 35:33.432
Hanson, yeah, but...

35:33.465 --> 35:35.734
it doesn't mean that GEO's
fixing the Super Bowl.

35:35.767 --> 35:38.637
Just wait until this year.
-You know something?

35:38.670 --> 35:39.938
All I'm gonna say,

35:39.971 --> 35:42.308
take the points,

35:42.341 --> 35:44.243
hit the over.

35:44.276 --> 35:48.380
Points... Over...

35:48.414 --> 35:50.148
Shh... (clicks tongue)

35:53.252 --> 35:55.187
Hit... the over.
-(whispers): Hit the over.

35:58.957 --> 36:01.793
Game, set, match--
Hanson loses.

36:01.827 --> 36:04.730
Yep.

36:04.763 --> 36:07.199
I guess I kind of
pissed you off before, huh?

36:08.800 --> 36:10.669
This is where we talk
about it, remember?

36:10.702 --> 36:12.404
It's not exactly like I know

36:12.438 --> 36:13.705
where I'm going with any of
this.

36:13.739 --> 36:15.774
I just need you to
be there for me.

36:15.807 --> 36:17.709
I am.

36:20.879 --> 36:22.448
Where? Kings?

36:22.481 --> 36:24.950
Oh-- Wilshire
Boulevard Temple?

36:24.983 --> 36:27.419
A rabbi and a lawyer
are having a debate.

36:27.453 --> 36:29.421
Ethics, politics and religion.

36:29.455 --> 36:32.524
And the rabbi's
gonna kick his ass.

36:32.558 --> 36:34.793
What makes you so sure?

36:34.826 --> 36:37.263
I like the guy
in his corner.

36:39.498 --> 36:40.432
You'll see.

36:40.466 --> 36:42.468
ALAN:
Yeah, I know Donnie mentioned

36:42.501 --> 36:44.536
that you two are having
quite the debate

36:44.570 --> 36:46.672
about the Kennedy
assassination, huh?

36:46.705 --> 36:48.340
DAVID: Well, can it really be
considered a debate

36:48.374 --> 36:49.808
if the other side has
no valid points?

36:49.841 --> 36:51.777
This guy still believes
in the Tooth Fairy.

36:51.810 --> 36:53.912
It was the Brown Derby--
that's where I was

36:53.945 --> 36:57.283
when I got the news
that Kennedy was shot.

37:04.290 --> 37:06.325
There was a group of us
that was very dissatisfied

37:06.358 --> 37:07.393
with the Warren
Commission findings,

37:07.426 --> 37:08.860
especially that thing

37:08.894 --> 37:09.961
about the "magic bullet" theory.

37:09.995 --> 37:11.263
So, uh, we decided

37:11.297 --> 37:12.598
to make an inquiry
of our own.

37:12.631 --> 37:15.467
It was a conspiracy.
-He acted alone, right?

37:15.501 --> 37:17.436
We, uh, didn't agree
with each other, either.

37:17.469 --> 37:18.537
About anything.

37:18.570 --> 37:20.906
It all ended
when Dan Sacks

37:20.939 --> 37:23.575
punched Terry Lowey
in the face.

37:23.609 --> 37:25.711
I-I never spoke
to any of them again.

37:34.653 --> 37:35.587
(clears throat)

37:38.457 --> 37:41.393
(Hanson GEO video playing
indistinctly in distance)

37:46.097 --> 37:48.467
HANSON (on video):
It's an especially trying time.

37:48.500 --> 37:52.371
The, uh... financial crisis.

37:52.404 --> 37:53.739
Wall Steet's
roller coaster ride.

37:53.772 --> 37:55.941
Instability of our friends
in the Mideast...

37:55.974 --> 37:58.977
and who knows what act
of Mother Nature next.

38:02.013 --> 38:03.615
I'd like to start...

38:03.649 --> 38:05.984
Guess I owe you a thank you...

38:06.017 --> 38:06.952
for saving my agent.

38:06.985 --> 38:09.621
It's a little outside
my job description,

38:09.655 --> 38:12.691
but I wasn't gonna watch a
scumbag kill a beautiful woman.

38:12.724 --> 38:14.926
Well, what exactly
were you hired to do?

38:14.960 --> 38:16.362
Watch the footage,

38:16.395 --> 38:17.996
make sure one member of the GEO

38:18.029 --> 38:19.598
doesn't show up on any of it.

38:19.631 --> 38:20.599
And?

38:20.632 --> 38:21.933
We're all good here.

38:21.967 --> 38:23.835
Oh, you think?

38:23.869 --> 38:25.537
Shooting at federal agents?
-Sorry I scared

38:25.571 --> 38:28.106
your guys, but I never
came close to hitting them.

38:28.139 --> 38:32.110
We're all
on the same team.

38:32.143 --> 38:34.513
Consider how I got in here.

38:34.546 --> 38:36.915
Piece of friendly advice:

38:36.948 --> 38:39.084
you might want
to get this place swept

38:39.117 --> 38:40.852
a little more
frequently for bugs.

38:40.886 --> 38:43.622
Who do I send the bill
for the car window to?

38:43.655 --> 38:44.590
Langley?

38:54.633 --> 38:58.069
This certainly is
some view.

38:58.103 --> 38:59.771
It certainly is.

38:59.805 --> 39:02.007
LARRY (over radio):
Goldilocks to Papa Bear.

39:02.040 --> 39:04.376
Can you hear me? Over.
-Yeah. Larry, we don't need

39:04.410 --> 39:06.712
use the walkie-talkies when
we're this close to each other,

39:06.745 --> 39:08.113
do we?

39:08.146 --> 39:09.715
I just wanted to say

39:09.748 --> 39:11.517
we're ready.
-On my three count.

39:11.550 --> 39:12.718
Oh, wait, let me
get my camera.

39:14.520 --> 39:16.855
(chuckles)

39:16.888 --> 39:18.156
Rolling.

39:18.189 --> 39:23.395
Three... two... one...

39:23.429 --> 39:24.930
Ignite.

39:27.699 --> 39:30.769
(laughing)

39:34.072 --> 39:35.441
Got it.

39:35.474 --> 39:36.174
Charles Eppes.

39:36.207 --> 39:37.576
Yes?

39:37.609 --> 39:39.545
You have just
committed a felony,

39:39.578 --> 39:41.513
and I have the evidence
to prove it.

39:41.547 --> 39:43.815
That's not funny.
(laughs)

39:43.849 --> 39:46.552
Come on, give me the camera.
-No. You know, I don't know if I

39:46.585 --> 39:48.654
can go out with a man that
constantly breaks the law.

39:48.687 --> 39:50.188
Oh, right.

39:50.221 --> 39:51.623
I mean, first, illicit e-mails
to Pakistan, now this...

39:51.657 --> 39:52.524
Give me the camera.

39:52.558 --> 39:54.426
Yeah-- mwah-- just
give me the camera.

39:54.460 --> 39:55.861
I'm serious.

39:55.894 --> 39:57.095
All right, you know
what I'm gonna do?

39:57.128 --> 39:58.597
What?

39:58.630 --> 40:00.065
Post your diary online.
-No, you're not.

40:00.098 --> 40:01.500
Yeah, I am.
-No, you're not.

40:01.533 --> 40:03.435
I am.
What's that Web site...?
