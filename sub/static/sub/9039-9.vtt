00:03.433 --> 00:08.633

I SHOULD MAKE FOR THANKSGIVING?

00:08.633 --> 00:10.000
- WHAT--

00:10.000 --> 00:11.600
WHAT DO YOU--WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:11.600 --> 00:14.333
MY MOM'S MAKING THANKSGIVING,
RIGHT, ISN'T SHE?

00:14.333 --> 00:16.300
SHE--SHE ALWAYS MAKES
THANKSGIVING, RIGHT?

00:16.300 --> 00:18.367
WHAT--DO YOU WANT TO--
SHOULD WE CALL HER?

00:18.367 --> 00:20.133
MAYBE WE SHOULD--
SHOULD WE CLEAR THIS UP--

00:20.133 --> 00:22.633
- CALM DOWN, RAY!

00:22.633 --> 00:25.367
YOUR MOMMY'S MAKING
THANKSGIVING.

00:25.367 --> 00:27.467
SHE JUST ASKED ME
TO BRING SOMETHING.

00:27.467 --> 00:30.100
- OH.
OH, ALL RIGHT, YEAH.

00:30.100 --> 00:34.033
IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

00:34.033 --> 00:38.100
YOU COULD BRING ROLLS.

00:38.100 --> 00:41.233
OR FOLDING CHAIRS.

00:41.233 --> 00:43.033
THINGS YOU BRING!

00:43.033 --> 00:44.233
- MOMMY!

00:44.233 --> 00:45.533
- WHAT IS IT, SWEETIE?

00:45.533 --> 00:47.067
- THE BOYS ARE
BOTHERING ME.

00:47.067 --> 00:48.267
- WHAT ARE
THEY DOING?

00:48.267 --> 00:49.767
- THEY'RE GOBBLING.

00:49.767 --> 00:51.700
- [chuckles]
GOBBLING.

00:51.700 --> 00:54.900
- I TOLD THEM TO STOP,
BUT THEY KEEP DOING IT.

00:54.900 --> 00:58.733
- WELL--
[twins gobbling]

both: [gobbling]

01:01.867 --> 01:03.233
[gobbling continues]

01:03.233 --> 01:04.500
- THEY'RE PROBABLY
JUST DOING IT

01:04.500 --> 01:05.867
BECAUSE IT
MAKES YOU MAD.

01:05.867 --> 01:07.500
IF YOU PRETEND
IT DOESN'T BOTHER YOU,

01:07.500 --> 01:08.900
I'M SURE THEY'LL STOP.

01:08.900 --> 01:12.667
- I DON'T KNOW.

01:12.667 --> 01:14.067
- YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU SHOULD DO?

01:14.067 --> 01:15.700
YOU SHOULD GOBBLE TOO.

01:15.700 --> 01:18.000
THEN THEY'LL GET BORED,
AND THEY'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.500
- EHH...

01:20.500 --> 01:24.467
- WHY, WHAT DO YOU GOT, RAY?

01:24.467 --> 01:26.333
- HEY, YOU TWO,
QUIT GOBBLING, YOU HEAR ME?

01:26.333 --> 01:28.133
OR YOU WILL NEVER SEE
ICE CREAM AGAIN

01:28.133 --> 01:29.633
FOR THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE!

01:29.633 --> 01:32.200

"HEY, OLD MAN, WHAT SEEMS

SO THE GUY SAYS,
"WELL, THEN WHY ARE YOU CRYING?"

03:01.600 --> 03:06.033

FORGOT WHERE I LIVE.

03:35.733 --> 03:41.167

I LOVE AN OLD MAN JOKE.

THIS WAS A TERRIFIC
THANKSGIVING.

04:12.267 --> 04:13.733
I JUST LOVE IT,
YOU KNOW?

THERE'S THAT REAL FAMILY

I MEAN, THIS SUNDAY IS
MY TURKEY TORTELLINI DAY.

04:38.067 --> 04:40.333

HOW TO MAKE IT.

04:40.333 --> 04:42.867
SO WE CAN HAVE
ANOTHER FAMILY FEAST.

04:42.867 --> 04:48.033
- ALL RIGHT, I'M WEARING
MY STRETCHY PANTS TO THAT ONE.

04:48.033 --> 04:49.667
- SUNDAY WOULD BE GREAT.

04:49.667 --> 04:51.733
- HEY, DEB!

04:51.733 --> 04:56.133
YOU SHOULD COOK WITH ME

HAVE MY HANDS FULL.

05:02.667 --> 05:07.500
THAT'S BATH DAY, YOU KNOW...
THE TWINS AND RAY.

05:07.500 --> 05:09.667

05:09.667 --> 05:11.067
- YEAH.

05:11.067 --> 05:12.433
- NO WAY.

05:12.433 --> 05:14.167
YOUR GIRL DOESN'T COOK,
YOU'RE OUT.

05:14.167 --> 05:17.633
- OH, STOP IT, FRANK.

05:17.633 --> 05:19.733
THE DINNER'S
FOR EVERYONE.

05:19.733 --> 05:24.233
- YEAH, AND I'LL TRY TO
COME UP WITH ANOTHER JOKE.

05:24.233 --> 05:26.333
[chortles]
I GOT IT.

05:26.333 --> 05:28.900
- WELL, I BETTER GET STARTED
WITH THESE DISHES.

05:28.900 --> 05:30.400
- NO, NO.
YOU RELAX, MARIE.

05:30.400 --> 05:31.467
RAY?

05:31.467 --> 05:33.567
- YEAH, MA.
RELAX.

05:35.067 --> 05:36.700
- RAY!

05:39.900 --> 05:41.800
- OH, THAT WENT
PRETTY GOOD, HUH?

05:41.800 --> 05:45.067
- I COULD KILL AMY.
COOKING WITH MARIE.

05:45.067 --> 05:46.700
- YEAH.

05:46.700 --> 05:48.467
WELL, SHE'S DRUNK.

05:51.667 --> 05:54.700
ANYWAY, YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO WENT ON AND ON

05:54.700 --> 05:56.767
ABOUT HOW NICE IT WAS
TO BE WITH EVERYBODY.

05:56.767 --> 05:58.333
- YEAH, TODAY WAS NICE,

05:58.333 --> 06:00.167
BUT I CAN'T BE IN THE KITCHEN
WITH YOUR MOTHER.

06:00.167 --> 06:02.900
THAT'S THE BELLY
OF THE BEAST.

06:02.900 --> 06:05.667
- YEAH...

06:05.667 --> 06:06.867
- DEBRA--
- AAH!

06:06.867 --> 06:09.067
HEY, HI.

06:09.067 --> 06:13.367
WOW, THOSE SHOES
ARE QUIET, HUH?

06:13.367 --> 06:15.700
- DEBRA, I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOUR ROLLS ARE ALL LEFT.

06:15.700 --> 06:17.167
I LIKED THEM.

06:17.167 --> 06:19.467
THE BURNT PART
GAVE THEM SOME FLAVOR.

06:19.467 --> 06:22.267
OH, AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT
THOSE POTS AND PANS, HONEY.

06:22.267 --> 06:23.667
I KNOW HOW
TO DO THOSE.

06:23.667 --> 06:25.667
- OH, WELL, CLEANING
IS CLEANING.

06:25.667 --> 06:28.100
- YOU'D THINK SO.

06:31.500 --> 06:34.233
- ALL RIGHT.
THERE IT IS.

06:34.233 --> 06:35.567
THE RAISING OF THE PAN.

06:35.567 --> 06:39.567
THANKSGIVING
IS OFFICIALLY OVER.

06:39.567 --> 06:41.233
- AND ALWAYS WITH
THAT LITTLE SMILE.

06:41.233 --> 06:42.500
SHE'S SO GOOD AT THAT.

06:42.500 --> 06:45.467
- YEAH, THAT WAS
LIKE A DRIVE-BY.

06:48.033 --> 06:50.000
- I SHOULD JUST
TELL HER TO--

06:50.000 --> 06:51.500
- YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU COULD DO?

06:51.500 --> 06:52.767
- WHAT?

06:52.767 --> 06:54.400
- GOBBLE.

06:54.400 --> 06:57.100
YEAH, IF YOU GOBBLE,
THEN SHE'LL GET BORED,

06:57.100 --> 06:59.600
AND SHE'LL JUST
LEAVE YOU ALONE.

06:59.600 --> 07:00.733
- THANKS.

07:00.733 --> 07:02.467
- [as Marie]
OH, DEBRA, I ENVY YOU,

07:02.467 --> 07:04.433
THE WAY YOU CAN
JUST ROLL OUT OF BED

07:04.433 --> 07:09.033
AND PUT ON ANYTHING
AND NOT EVEN CARE.

07:09.033 --> 07:11.667
GOBBLE, GOBBLE,
GOBBLE, GOBBLE!

07:11.667 --> 07:16.300
YEAH.

07:16.300 --> 07:17.967
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT.

07:17.967 --> 07:20.833
- WHAT?

07:20.833 --> 07:22.433
- EVERYTHING I TOLD ALLY

07:22.433 --> 07:24.233
ABOUT PRETENDING
IT DOESN'T BOTHER HER,

07:24.233 --> 07:26.533
WHY HAVEN'T I TRIED
THAT WITH YOUR MOTHER?

07:26.533 --> 07:30.900
- BECAUSE THAT'S HOW
YOU DEAL WITH CHILDREN.

07:30.900 --> 07:32.133
YEAH...OKAY.

07:32.133 --> 07:33.733
BUT NORMAL CHILDREN.

07:33.733 --> 07:40.100
THIS ONE--THIS ONE'S BIG
AND A LITTLE OFF HER NUT.

07:40.100 --> 07:41.733
- NO, NO.

07:41.733 --> 07:44.133
EVERY TIME MARIE SAYS SOMETHING
MEAN OR INSULTING,

07:44.133 --> 07:45.600
I GET MAD.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.367
AND MAYBE THAT'S WHY
SHE KEEPS DOING IT.

07:47.367 --> 07:49.367
I SHOULD JUST
CHANGE THE WAY I REACT TO HER.

07:49.367 --> 07:51.400
GOD, THAT'S
IN EVERY BOOK.

07:51.400 --> 07:52.667
- BOOKS.

07:52.667 --> 07:55.833
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH HOW YOU REACT.

07:55.833 --> 07:59.267
- RAY, I WANTED TO HIT HER
WITH A FRYING PAN.

07:59.267 --> 08:01.733
- GET IN LINE.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.900
- YOUR FATHER'S
ON THE COUCH AND HE THINKS

08:06.900 --> 08:11.300
FROM A LYING-DOWN POSITION,
HE CAN EAT MORE MASHED POTATOES.

08:11.300 --> 08:12.700
- HEY.
HEY, MARIE.

08:12.700 --> 08:16.500
I WOULD LOVE TO COOK
WITH YOU GUYS ON SUNDAY.

08:16.500 --> 08:18.267
- REALLY?

08:18.267 --> 08:21.333
- BELLY OF THE BEAST.

08:21.333 --> 08:23.400
- AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
RAY'S GONNA BE AT THE AUTO SHOW.

08:23.400 --> 08:24.867
SO WE COULD DO IT
AT MY HOUSE.

08:24.867 --> 08:27.367
WE CAN HANG OUT THERE ALL DAY.
IT'LL BE FUN.

08:27.367 --> 08:30.733
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,
DEAR?

08:30.733 --> 08:34.000
- YEAH, I'M JUST SUPER EXCITED
ABOUT SUNDAY.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.500
- OKAY.
WONDERFUL.

08:36.500 --> 08:39.300
THIS SHOULD BE
EDUCATIONAL FOR YOU.

08:42.300 --> 08:46.133
- EDUCATIONAL.
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

08:48.033 --> 08:49.933
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:49.933 --> 08:51.467
A WHOLE DAY COOKING
WITH MY MOTHER?

08:51.467 --> 08:52.700
- HEY, LOOK,

08:52.700 --> 08:54.933
UNLESS I MAKE AN EFFORT
TO CHANGE MY BEHAVIOR,

08:54.933 --> 08:57.167
I CAN'T EXPECT YOUR FAMILY
TO CHANGE THEIRS.

08:57.167 --> 08:59.467
AND YOU COULD TRY THIS TOO,
YOU KNOW.

08:59.467 --> 09:01.067
- WHY?

09:01.067 --> 09:03.067
I'M USED TO THEM.

09:04.433 --> 09:07.233
IT'S LIKE GETTING
INTO A HOT BATH.

09:07.233 --> 09:08.600
YOU KNOW,
AT FIRST IT'S SO HOT

09:08.600 --> 09:10.333
THAT YOU DON'T THINK
YOU CAN TAKE IT.

09:10.333 --> 09:12.800
BUT THEN, YOU KNOW, ONCE YOU
GET YOUR LUGGAGE IN,

09:12.800 --> 09:15.000
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

09:23.467 --> 09:26.333
- YOU DID A WONDERFUL JOB
OF KNEADING, AMY.

09:26.333 --> 09:30.033
- THANKS.
I "KNEADED" TO HEAR THAT.

09:33.467 --> 09:37.167
- ADORABLE.

09:37.167 --> 09:40.367
OKAY, NEXT WE'RE GOING
TO ROLL THE DOUGH.

09:40.367 --> 09:43.333
NOW, IT CAN'T BE
TOO THICK OR TOO THIN.

09:43.333 --> 09:47.067
IT'S NOT EASY.
IT NEEDS A LIGHT TOUCH.

09:51.133 --> 09:55.400
SHALL WE LET AMY CONTINUE?

09:55.400 --> 09:57.100
- YEAH, GO AHEAD, AMY.

09:57.100 --> 10:00.600
I MEAN SHE'S
ALREADY ON A ROLL.

10:03.767 --> 10:05.500
- OKAY, YES.
ALL RIGHT.

10:05.500 --> 10:08.433
SO THAT'S GOOD.
SEE?

10:08.433 --> 10:11.833
BACK AND FORTH.
JUST LIKE IRONING.

10:11.833 --> 10:15.733
OH...

10:15.733 --> 10:17.367
- [laughs]
I KNOW.

10:17.367 --> 10:20.433
IT'S TRUE.
I CAN'T IRON.

10:22.333 --> 10:25.767
- WELL...WHERE WERE WE?

10:25.767 --> 10:27.033
OH.
OKAY, OKAY.

10:27.033 --> 10:28.933
NOW, AMY,
YOU CONTINUE DOING THAT,

10:28.933 --> 10:31.400
AND I'M GONNA NEED
SOME HELP WITH THE SAUCE.

10:31.400 --> 10:34.633
UM...

10:34.633 --> 10:38.433
HOW DOES STIRRING
SOUND TO YOU?

10:38.433 --> 10:41.000
- WHATEVER YOU SAY, MARIE.
YOU'RE THE MASTER.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.100
- WHAT?

10:43.100 --> 10:44.600
- YOU'RE THE MASTER.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.067
I MEAN, I'M JUST
HAPPY TO BE HERE.

10:46.067 --> 10:48.433
YOU'RE A BRILLIANT COOK.

10:54.767 --> 10:58.467
- THANK YOU.

10:58.467 --> 11:00.200
THOSE ARE SUCH
LOVELY EARRINGS.

11:00.200 --> 11:03.033
- OH, THANK YOU, MARIE.

11:03.033 --> 11:08.200
- YOU ALWAYS HAVE
SUCH NICE TASTE.

11:08.200 --> 11:12.933
ARE YOU
ALL RIGHT, DEAR?

11:12.933 --> 11:16.133
- YES, I'VE JUST
NEVER SEEN...

11:16.133 --> 11:17.967
SUCH LOVELY EARRINGS.

11:17.967 --> 11:20.167
- OH, YEAH, YOU LIKE THOSE?
YEAH.

11:20.167 --> 11:22.100
- MOMMY.
- YEAH, HONEY?

11:22.100 --> 11:23.700
- THE BOYS KEEP
BLOCKING THE TV.

11:23.700 --> 11:25.600
- WELL, REMEMBER
WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT?

11:25.600 --> 11:28.467
PRETEND IT DOESN'T BOTHER YOU,
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

11:28.467 --> 11:32.133
- WHEN'S DADDY COMING HOME?

11:32.133 --> 11:34.933
- JUST TRY IT.

11:34.933 --> 11:39.533
TRUST ME.
IT WORKS, HUH?

11:39.533 --> 11:41.767
DID YOU WANNA SAY
SOMETHING, MARIE?

11:41.767 --> 11:43.400
- I DON'T WANT
TO BUTT IN, DEAR.

11:43.400 --> 11:46.867
- NO, YOU GO AHEAD.
BUTT.

11:46.867 --> 11:48.767
- WELL, YOUR ADVICE.

11:48.767 --> 11:51.000
I'M NOT SAYING
IT WAS WRONG, DEAR,

11:51.000 --> 11:54.467
BUT, WELL,
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

11:54.467 --> 11:55.833
- NO?

11:55.833 --> 11:58.767
- NO, SEE, I'VE BEEN MOTHERING
FOR 40 YEARS.

11:58.767 --> 12:03.233
AND I JUST THINK THAT
IF ALLY PRETENDS IT'S FINE,

12:03.233 --> 12:05.300
THEN THE TWINS ARE
GOING TO BEHAVE WORSE

12:05.300 --> 12:08.367
THAN YOU ALREADY LET THEM.

12:14.100 --> 12:17.100
- I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT
THAT WAY.

12:17.100 --> 12:18.700
YOU'RE RIGHT.

12:18.700 --> 12:21.700
GOD, YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST
SOMETIMES I AM SO SCATTERED.

12:21.700 --> 12:23.133
YEAH.

12:23.133 --> 12:25.433
GOBBLE, GOBBLE,
GOBBLE, GOBBLE.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.100
- HEY, THERE THEY ARE.
- OH, HI.

12:41.100 --> 12:42.867
- SO HOW WAS
THE CAR THING?

12:42.867 --> 12:44.067
- IT WAS GREAT.

12:44.067 --> 12:45.433
FERRARIS,
LAMBORGHINIS.

12:45.433 --> 12:46.900
- YEAH, DAD WAS TOLD
TO STOP TOUCHING

12:46.900 --> 12:50.067
SOME OF THE FINEST
AUTOMOBILES IN THE WORLD.

12:50.067 --> 12:52.333
- OKAY, DINNER
IS ALMOST READY.

12:52.333 --> 12:53.900
- APPETIZERS FIRST.

12:53.900 --> 12:56.033
GENTLEMEN, IF YOU'LL
FOLLOW ME INTO THE LOUNGE.

12:56.033 --> 12:59.000
- AHH...

12:59.000 --> 13:00.300
- AND, MARIE?
- YEAH.

13:00.300 --> 13:02.200
- I'LL KEEP AN EYE
ON THAT SAUCE.

13:02.200 --> 13:05.200
- OOH, OKAY, DEAR.
- OKAY.

13:08.067 --> 13:09.467
BAD DAY?

13:09.467 --> 13:13.333
- YEP.

13:13.333 --> 13:14.967
- DIDN'T YOU EVEN
ENJOY THE CARS?

13:14.967 --> 13:16.500
- I WOULD HAVE

13:16.500 --> 13:19.567
IF I COULD HAVE BACKED ONE
OVER THOSE TWO IDIOTS.

13:23.233 --> 13:24.667
THEY--THEY--THEY
HAD A FIELD DAY.

13:24.667 --> 13:27.300
THEY MADE FUN
OF MY CORDUROY PANTS.

13:27.300 --> 13:29.433
ZVEET, ZVEET, ZVEET, ZVEET.

13:29.433 --> 13:31.000
THEN SOME WOMAN
SPILLED SODA ON ME,

13:31.000 --> 13:32.333
AND THEY'RE LAUGHING.

13:32.333 --> 13:35.333
AND IT WAS LIKE THEY WERE
AT DISNEYLAND.

13:36.867 --> 13:38.400
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

13:38.400 --> 13:41.633
- YOU CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE.

13:41.633 --> 13:47.600
- I IMAGINE NAME-CALLING
AND SOMEONE THROWING A SHOE.

13:47.600 --> 13:48.800
- IT WAS FANTASTIC.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.600
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
YOUR MOTHER DID START OUT

13:50.600 --> 13:52.233
WITH HER USUAL
LITTLE REMARKS.

13:52.233 --> 13:53.967
BUT I JUST LET IT
ROLL RIGHT OFF OF ME.

13:53.967 --> 13:56.633
I LAUGHED; I JOKED;
I DID IT.

13:56.633 --> 14:01.067
- YEAH, WELL, I TRIED IT TOO,
AND IT DIDN'T WORK.

14:01.067 --> 14:02.433
- HOW LONG DID YOU
TRY IT FOR?

14:02.433 --> 14:04.300
- NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS,
ALL RIGHT?

14:04.300 --> 14:06.567
IT DOESN'T WORK.

14:06.567 --> 14:08.233
- IT DOES WORK.

14:08.233 --> 14:10.333
IT'S ALL
ABOUT ATTITUDE.

14:10.333 --> 14:12.033
YOU DIDN'T CHANGE
YOUR ATTITUDE.

14:12.033 --> 14:13.333
YOU HAD A BAD DAY.

14:13.333 --> 14:16.667
I CHANGED MY ATTITUDE,
AND VOILA!

14:16.667 --> 14:21.233
- DON'T SAY VOILA.

14:21.233 --> 14:24.800
- YOU'RE JUST MAD
BECAUSE I FOUND OUT A WAY

14:24.800 --> 14:30.567
TO GET ALONG WITH YOUR FAMILY,
AND YOU NEVER HAVE.

14:30.567 --> 14:32.433
- WHAT, YOU THINK
YOU'VE FIGURED THEM OUT?

14:32.433 --> 14:36.100
YOU CAN'T CHANGE THEM,
YOU DIZZY BROAD.

14:39.933 --> 14:43.833
- DEBRA, I KNEW IT.
YOUR CANAPES ARE A BIG HIT.

14:43.833 --> 14:45.267
- I'LL BE RIGHT IN.

14:45.267 --> 14:48.333
MY CANAPES ARE A BIG HIT.

14:48.333 --> 14:49.400
- YEAH.

14:49.400 --> 14:52.667
YOU'RE SURE
SHE SAID HIT?

14:55.833 --> 14:57.033
- SHALL WE?
- YEAH.

14:57.033 --> 14:58.233
YEAH, BUT I'LL TELL YA,

14:58.233 --> 14:59.567
IF I HEAR ONE MORE
THING FROM THEM,

14:59.567 --> 15:01.400
I'M GONNA GO BATMAN
ON THEIR ASS.

15:01.400 --> 15:06.700
- OR...OR MAYBE
YOU COULD JUST TRY...

15:06.700 --> 15:08.467
- YEAH, YEAH, AH.

15:11.533 --> 15:14.067
- CAN I SIT HERE, MARIE?
- OH, COME ON, HONEY.

15:18.867 --> 15:20.733
- SO, BOYS,

15:20.733 --> 15:23.567
WHAT WAS YOUR FAVORITE PART
OF THE AUTO SHOW?

15:23.567 --> 15:26.633
- RAY TAKING A COKE
IN THE LAP.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.700
- ALL RIGHT, FRANK.
LEAVE HIM ALONE.

15:29.700 --> 15:32.500
- YEAH, YEAH, YOU WEREN'T
WITH THIS SOURPUSS ALL DAY.

15:32.500 --> 15:38.633
- MY DAY WASN'T SO EASY EITHER.

15:38.633 --> 15:40.500
- WHAT?

15:40.500 --> 15:41.900
- NOTHING.

15:41.900 --> 15:44.800
- YOU HAD A NICE TIME TODAY,
DIDN'T YOU, MARIE?

15:44.800 --> 15:46.733
- OH, OF COURSE.

15:46.733 --> 15:48.600
- WHAT, MARIE?

15:48.600 --> 15:51.033
- NOTHING.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.600
IT'S JUST THAT SOMETIMES

15:52.600 --> 15:55.067
IF YOU HAVE TO SPEND
AN ENTIRE DAY WITH A PERSON,

15:55.067 --> 15:58.067
THAT Y-YOU NEED
TO MAKE AN EFFORT.

15:58.067 --> 16:01.400
- IT WAS AN EFFORT
TO BE WITH ME TODAY?

16:01.400 --> 16:03.367
- NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

16:03.367 --> 16:05.367
THIS WAS
A VERY PLEASANT DAY.

16:05.367 --> 16:08.900
- YES, BECAUSE
I MADE AN EFFORT.

16:08.900 --> 16:12.000
I WAS NICE.
IT WAS ME.

16:13.967 --> 16:15.667
- OKAY, DEAR.

16:15.667 --> 16:17.967
[whispering] I DON'T KNOW
WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT.

16:17.967 --> 16:21.300
- NO, NO, NO.
NO, NO, NO.

16:21.300 --> 16:26.200
NO, NO, NO, WAIT.
I--YOU--

16:26.200 --> 16:27.833
AMY, YOU WERE
THERE TODAY.

16:27.833 --> 16:36.367
YOU SAW US.
WHO WAS NICE?

16:36.367 --> 16:38.467
- I THOUGHT
YOU WERE BOTH NICE.

16:38.467 --> 16:42.067
YOU'RE BOTH
VERY NICE PEOPLE.

16:42.067 --> 16:44.600
WINE, ANYONE?

16:49.067 --> 16:51.367
- MARIE, YOU WERE
CRITICIZING ME,

16:51.367 --> 16:53.233
ASKING ME
IF I KNEW HOW TO STIR,

16:53.233 --> 16:55.233
EXPLAINING
A ROLLING PIN TO ME.

16:55.233 --> 16:57.100
- WELL, I WAS JUST
OFFERING YOU USEFUL ADVICE,

16:57.100 --> 16:58.567
LIKE I ALWAYS DO.

16:58.567 --> 16:59.767
- ADVICE?

16:59.767 --> 17:01.000
- OF COURSE.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.967
IT'S ONE OF THE JOYS OF MY LIFE.

17:03.967 --> 17:06.367
BUT TODAY,
FOR SOME REASON,

17:06.367 --> 17:10.400
YOU--YOU SEEMED
TO TAKE IT SO BADLY.

17:10.400 --> 17:12.067
- WHAT?

17:12.067 --> 17:15.300
- EXCUSE ME ONE SECOND.
HOLD ON JUST ONE SECOND.

17:15.300 --> 17:19.333
COULD YOU PASS
THE CANAPES, PLEASE?

17:19.333 --> 17:20.767
- BADLY?

17:20.767 --> 17:25.100
I-I-I WAS LAUGHING.
I WAS MAKING JOKES ABOUT MYSELF.

17:25.100 --> 17:26.300
- I KNOW,
AND TO BE HONEST,

17:26.300 --> 17:29.600
I--I FOUND THAT
TERRIBLY SARCASTIC.

17:31.067 --> 17:32.367
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
SARCASTIC?

17:32.367 --> 17:34.967
- WELL, IT MEANS A SORT
OF PHONY FACADE--

17:34.967 --> 17:37.000
- I THINK I KNOW
WHAT SARCASTIC MEANS.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.967
- SCOOCH OVER
A LITTLE, WILL YA?

17:39.967 --> 17:42.833
- IF YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO SPEND THE DAY WITH ME, DEBRA,

17:42.833 --> 17:45.667
I THINK AT LEAST YOU SHOULD
HAVE BEEN HONEST ABOUT IT.

17:45.667 --> 17:48.167
- I WAS BEING NICE!

17:48.167 --> 17:49.400
I WAS TRYING TO BE NICE!

17:49.400 --> 17:51.200
THAT WAS NICE IN THERE!
TODAY WAS NICE!

17:51.200 --> 17:53.867
AND I WAS NICE, DAMN IT!

17:53.867 --> 17:56.867
- SEE, NOW YOU'RE GETTING
A BIT EMOTIONAL.

17:56.867 --> 17:58.800
- GEE, I WONDER WHY?

17:58.800 --> 18:02.700
- AW, BACK TO SARCASTIC.

18:02.700 --> 18:05.567
- BUT IF--IF YOU DIDN'T THINK
I WAS BEING NICE,

18:05.567 --> 18:07.700
THEN WHY WERE
YOU NICE BACK TO ME?

18:07.700 --> 18:10.367
- WELL, WHEN IN ROME...

18:10.367 --> 18:13.433
- HOW COULD YOU--
YOU ARE--

18:13.433 --> 18:17.433
- A PRIEST AND A RABBI
WALK INTO A BAR.

18:17.433 --> 18:18.467
HA HA!

18:18.467 --> 18:21.200
AND ONE OF THEM
HAS A PARROT.

18:21.200 --> 18:24.300
HA HA HA!
RIGHT?

18:24.300 --> 18:28.000
AND HE SAYS TO THE--

18:28.000 --> 18:29.767
[groans]

18:31.500 --> 18:33.767
CAN I HAVE
SOME WINE, AMY?

18:33.767 --> 18:35.733
- NO.

18:35.733 --> 18:37.967
- WAIT--WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

18:37.967 --> 18:39.167
ANSWER ME THIS.

18:39.167 --> 18:40.667
RAY, ROBERT...

18:40.667 --> 18:43.600
[both groan]

18:43.600 --> 18:45.333
LISTEN, I KNOW YOU
WEREN'T THERE TODAY,

18:45.333 --> 18:47.167
BUT WOULDN'T YOU AGREE
THAT SOMETIMES--

18:47.167 --> 18:49.167
AND I'M NOT SAYING
ALL THE TIME--

18:49.167 --> 18:53.633
BUT SOMETIMES MARIE
CAN BE CRITICAL OF ME?

19:08.067 --> 19:12.433
FRANK?

19:12.433 --> 19:16.067
COME ON!

19:16.067 --> 19:18.000
RAY?

19:18.000 --> 19:22.067
- I TOLD YOU NOT TO DO THIS.

19:24.567 --> 19:26.000
- RAY, LOOK AT ME.
- NO.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.200
- LOOK AT ME.
- NO.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.500
- LOOK AT ME!
- NO!

19:28.500 --> 19:30.900
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
DEBRA, ALL RIGHT.

19:30.900 --> 19:32.167
LET--NOW WE HAVE--
IN THE PAST,

19:32.167 --> 19:34.233
WE'VE HAD
OUR SHARE OF TIFFS.

19:34.233 --> 19:35.767
BUT I TRULY BELIEVE

19:35.767 --> 19:37.633
IT'S BECAUSE YOU
MISUNDERSTAND ME.

19:37.633 --> 19:41.633
I-I AM NOT INTERESTED
IN A RELATIONSHIP

19:41.633 --> 19:46.133
OF ARTIFICIAL PLEASANTRIES
AND PHONY SMILES.

19:46.133 --> 19:48.900
YOU NEVER EVER
HAVE TO PRETEND WITH ME.

19:48.900 --> 19:51.800
I'M ALWAYS HONEST
WITH YOU, AREN'T I?

19:51.800 --> 19:55.167
AND IF I SEE SOMETHING

19:55.167 --> 19:58.733
THAT YOU DESPERATELY
NEED HELP WITH--

19:58.733 --> 20:03.233
LIKE...COOKING...

20:03.233 --> 20:06.133
CLEANING...

20:06.133 --> 20:08.933
THE CHILDREN...

20:08.933 --> 20:11.767
YOUR HAIR...

20:11.767 --> 20:15.967
I CARE SO MUCH THAT
I HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING,

20:15.967 --> 20:18.067
'CAUSE I WANT TO HELP.

20:18.067 --> 20:19.433
OH, HONEY,

20:19.433 --> 20:23.067
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE WORRIED, DEAR.

20:23.067 --> 20:27.033
I FORGIVE YOU
FOR TODAY.

20:27.033 --> 20:31.400
AND I'M ALWAYS
HERE TO HELP.

20:38.067 --> 20:40.567
- VOILA.

20:51.500 --> 20:54.233
- LADIES, WHATEVER YOU
WENT THROUGH TODAY WAS WORTH IT.

20:54.233 --> 20:56.400
AN EXCELLENT MEAL.

20:56.400 --> 21:00.133
I GIVE IT TWO BUTTONS
AND A ZIP.

21:02.600 --> 21:04.967
WHAT KIND OF ICE CREAM
YOU GOT THERE, RAY?

21:04.967 --> 21:06.967
- CHOCOLATE SWIRLY.

21:06.967 --> 21:08.233
- WHAT'S THAT?

21:08.233 --> 21:09.667
I CAN'T HEAR YOU
OVER YOUR PANTS.

21:09.667 --> 21:10.967
[Robert laughs]

21:10.967 --> 21:13.433
- YEAH, NOISY PANTS.

21:13.433 --> 21:15.067
- THESE AREN'T
THE SAME PANTS, OKAY?

21:15.067 --> 21:16.367
I CHANGED THEM
BEFORE DINNER.

21:16.367 --> 21:19.567
- THEN YOU BETTER
SEE A DOCTOR.

21:19.567 --> 21:23.867
- [chuckles]
NOISY LUGGAGE.

21:23.867 --> 21:26.233
- YEAH.

21:26.233 --> 21:28.133
VERY FUNNY.
VERY FUNNY.

21:28.133 --> 21:31.433
SOUNDS TO ME LIKE NOBODY
WANTS ANY ICE CREAM.

21:38.433 --> 21:40.733
- SORRY.

21:40.733 --> 21:43.067
- I'M SORRY TOO.

21:48.167 --> 21:51.300
- SEE THAT?

21:51.300 --> 21:54.467
THAT IS HOW IT'S DONE.

22:04.867 --> 22:06.700
IT'S NOT FUNNY!
