PETE: You know what, Taco?
I'm gonna get this.

00:04.283 --> 00:07.021
I got a promotion, I'm riding
a three-game winning streak.

00:07.023 --> 00:09.646
I mean, you got to give yourself
little treats every now and then, right?

00:09.647 --> 00:12.427
TACO: You know what? You're right.
We are two captains of industry.

00:12.428 --> 00:14.460
We need to spoil ourselves once
in a while.

00:14.462 --> 00:17.505
You know what I could
really use? Another sock.

00:17.506 --> 00:20.690
- Man's got to have two, Taco.
- I'm gonna see if I can find one.

00:20.691 --> 00:23.068
Uh, sir, there's a problem
with your card.

00:23.070 --> 00:24.737
There shouldn't be.
That's really...

00:24.739 --> 00:28.452
(cell phone ringing) I'm sorry.
Excuse me one second. Hello?

00:28.453 --> 00:31.211
Hi, Mr. "Eek-hart." This is Ann Marie
from your credit card company.

00:31.237 --> 00:32.466
This is Pete <i>Eckhart.</i>

00:32.467 --> 00:35.024
Mr. Eek-hart, I'm calling
because we see a purchase here

00:35.026 --> 00:39.044
for $210 at a
men's boutique.

00:39.045 --> 00:43.419
That's because I am buying
a $210 sweater from a men's boutique.

00:43.420 --> 00:44.742
Really? You?

00:44.743 --> 00:48.079
Uh, I'll have you know this is not
the first fine item that I've purchased.

00:48.080 --> 00:50.262
<i>Actually, I'm looking at your
purchasing history,</i>

00:50.263 --> 00:53.785
and I don't see anything
close to a high-end store;

00:53.786 --> 00:56.118
I just see a lot of Old Navy,
more Old Navy.

00:56.119 --> 00:59.577
and lots of Jimmy Cheffo's
Meatball Experience.

00:59.578 --> 01:02.885
I like Jimmy Cheffo's Meatball Experience.
What's the problem?

01:02.887 --> 01:04.525
I'm just trying to look out
for you.

01:04.527 --> 01:07.227
Your economic profile has you
listed as "working poor."

01:07.228 --> 01:09.358
I'll have you know I recently
got a promotion,

01:09.360 --> 01:11.260
I am on a three-game winning
streak in my league.

01:11.262 --> 01:13.879
I mean, it's an eight-team league, but
it's still very competitive considering...

01:13.904 --> 01:14.819
(woman yawns)

01:14.820 --> 01:16.708
- Are you yawning right now?
- Sorry, what were you saying?

01:16.723 --> 01:18.101
Why don't you head over
to Jimmy Cheffo's,

01:18.102 --> 01:19.895
get yourself a meatball sub
and wake up?

01:19.921 --> 01:23.026
No, thank you. I'm happy
with the <i>E coli</i> that I have.

01:23.028 --> 01:25.762
Okay, it should be good now.
Thanks.

01:25.764 --> 01:28.865
Okay.
(Pete sighs)

01:28.867 --> 01:31.635
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:32.043 --> 01:33.796
I really like
your sweater.

01:34.104 --> 01:36.479
You know, I've been on a bit
of a winning streak lately,

01:36.480 --> 01:39.198
and I thought
I would splurge.

01:39.199 --> 01:41.472
Well, I'd like to see your
winning streak continue.

01:41.740 --> 01:44.372
- You would?
- I would.

01:44.465 --> 01:46.556
- I'm Pete, by the way.
- Georgia.

01:46.557 --> 01:47.718
Oh, Georgia.
Nice to meet you.

01:47.720 --> 01:49.553
- Nice to meet you.
- Check it out.

01:49.555 --> 01:51.555
- How do I look?
- Where did you get that, Taco?

01:51.557 --> 01:52.967
Found it in a room back there.

01:52.968 --> 01:55.145
There are no price tags on
anything, so it's all free.

01:55.146 --> 01:58.700
They also have a bunch of stun guns,
but I have too many of those already.

01:58.701 --> 02:00.661
- Good shopping with you, Pete.
- Yep.

02:01.061 --> 02:04.061

02:04.600 --> 02:06.936
KEVIN: How long were you planning
on staying here tonight?

02:06.937 --> 02:08.937
RUXIN: Just long enough
to miss dinner with my family,

02:08.951 --> 02:11.523
so that I can sit in front of the TV
and eat dinner alone.

02:11.524 --> 02:13.600
- JENNY: Hey, guys.
- Hey...

02:13.601 --> 02:15.034
Gonna be all right, sweetie?

02:15.035 --> 02:16.865
- Yeah.
- All right, go up and change.

02:16.866 --> 02:18.109
Come down for dinner in a little
bit, okay?

02:18.110 --> 02:19.572
What's wrong with her?

02:19.573 --> 02:22.597
Oh, she had a really rough
basketball practice.

02:22.598 --> 02:24.693
She said the coach is
like a drill sergeant.

02:24.694 --> 02:25.999
I think you should go
talk to that coach.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.359
I don't like her
talking to them like that.

02:27.360 --> 02:28.820
No, no, no, no, no, no.

02:28.852 --> 02:31.675
Come on, Kevin, go.
You do love arguing with lesbians.

02:31.676 --> 02:35.895
Just 'cause she is a female basketball
coach, you can't say that she's a lesbian.

02:35.896 --> 02:37.796
- She is... she's got to be.
- Hey, Ellie!

02:37.798 --> 02:39.068
- No, it's all right...
- Stop.

02:39.069 --> 02:40.294
- Is your coach a lesbian?
- Stop it!

02:40.295 --> 02:42.128
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- She can tell... kids can tell.

02:42.129 --> 02:44.833
- We don't talk about it.
- Yeah, it's a cultural unmentionable.

02:44.834 --> 02:45.716
Really?

02:45.717 --> 02:47.751
Yeah, the way Asians are
great at string instruments.

02:47.752 --> 02:51.456
So I can't mention that NBA players
universally cheat on their wives.

02:51.482 --> 02:53.632
No, it is a cultural
unmentionable.

02:53.658 --> 02:56.214
It offends every
Kardashian.

02:56.215 --> 03:00.334
So I'm not allowed to talk about that
Ethiopians are always parking attendants.

03:00.335 --> 03:02.884
- No, you are not.
- That Israelis all deal cell phones.

03:02.886 --> 03:04.886
- They do.
- No, but you can't talk about it, sweetie.

03:04.890 --> 03:07.107
That Africans have very yellow eyes,

03:07.108 --> 03:10.142
or that eating dinner next to
a table from Texas is unbearable.

03:10.143 --> 03:11.377
- Of course.
- Not out loud.

03:11.378 --> 03:14.015
- You know what, then? I'm going home.
- Great.

03:14.235 --> 03:15.398
That was easy.

03:15.399 --> 03:18.895
You have seriously violated
the entire dating protocol.

03:18.921 --> 03:21.233
What, by having sex with you
before dinner instead of after?

03:21.234 --> 03:22.699
- Bingo! Yes.
- Mmm.

03:22.700 --> 03:26.708
I now am under no obligation
to buy you food. You're going to starve.

03:26.709 --> 03:28.467
Well, you know, next time,
I'll try to get it right.

03:28.468 --> 03:29.578
Speaking of getting it right,

03:29.604 --> 03:31.891
we should be sitting up at
that nice table by the window.

03:31.892 --> 03:33.807
I'm good here.
I'm just fine.

03:33.833 --> 03:36.176
Oh, you're good, you like it
here by the bathroom?

03:36.202 --> 03:37.103
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

03:37.104 --> 03:41.225
Okay, that means... stomach
problem, a coke habit, maybe?

03:41.226 --> 03:43.625
- Neither.
- Neither, hmm, okay.

03:43.627 --> 03:45.247
I'm married.

03:45.273 --> 03:49.431
To your job or...
to the sea?

03:49.433 --> 03:52.500
- No.
- Okay, all right.

03:52.502 --> 03:57.559
Is, um... is that going to be
a problem?

03:58.891 --> 04:00.891
Um...

04:01.626 --> 04:05.191
Why so glum, chums? It's the last
weekend before playoffs. Come on!

04:05.217 --> 04:07.039
Says the person who's
already in the playoffs.

04:07.040 --> 04:08.158
Yes!

04:08.159 --> 04:11.055
My team's up shit creek, and
I need a win and some help.

04:11.056 --> 04:12.487
- I'm in the same boat.
- Me, too.

04:12.489 --> 04:14.813
ANDRE: I'm freaking out.
I'm losing my clear hair over this.

04:14.839 --> 04:17.791
How will you know? Will you find
clumps of nothing in the sink?

04:17.793 --> 04:19.694
- No, it's a real thing, okay?
- Hey, guys.

04:19.696 --> 04:21.363
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:21.365 --> 04:23.031
Okay, congratulations.
You got a job.

04:23.033 --> 04:25.033
- That's good.
- No, just a fan.

04:25.035 --> 04:27.466
- A fan? Fan of what?
- Security.

04:27.492 --> 04:30.083
Yeah, everyone's such a big fan
of the Bears in this town.

04:30.084 --> 04:32.557
Uh-uh, not this guy.
I love Security.

04:32.563 --> 04:35.818
Wait, you think Security
is an NFL team?

04:35.819 --> 04:38.161
See them out there
on the field on Sunday?

04:38.187 --> 04:39.939
Man, they did
such a good job.

04:39.941 --> 04:41.731
What would the mascot of
Security be?

04:41.732 --> 04:45.042
It's usually, like, a huge
white man in a tiny lawn chair

04:45.043 --> 04:48.115
or a tiny black man in a huge
collared shirt.

04:48.116 --> 04:49.536
Go, Security!
(cell phone vibrating)

04:49.537 --> 04:50.834
- Yeah.
- Go, Security...

04:50.835 --> 04:53.011
All right, guys. I got to bust out.
I got a date with the lady.

04:53.012 --> 04:55.631
When do we get to meet this secretive
lady you're keeping from us?

04:55.632 --> 04:56.524
Eh, whatever.

04:56.550 --> 05:00.934
Have you crossed over the perv Rubicon
into... underage ladies?

05:00.950 --> 05:02.950
No. No, it's nothing like that.

05:02.952 --> 05:05.487
I just got involved with a...
married woman.

05:05.488 --> 05:07.548
- (gasps) Peter!
- Oh...

05:07.549 --> 05:12.093
Man, that's, uh...
that's... that's wrong.

05:12.094 --> 05:13.941
You shouldn't do that.
That hurts people.

05:13.942 --> 05:16.122
Try that again like you're
not in a hostage video.

05:16.123 --> 05:17.678
You know what?
It's disgusting, Pete.

05:17.679 --> 05:19.248
Look, I'm not doing
anything wrong.

05:19.249 --> 05:21.916
I'm just not stopping her from
doing wrong things to me

05:21.917 --> 05:23.160
which happen
to feel great.

05:23.161 --> 05:26.148
Hey, every girl that I've ever dated
also was seeing somebody else, too.

05:26.149 --> 05:28.249
I once got so drunk I married
a married woman.

05:28.250 --> 05:30.131
This is going to be so
exciting for you, Pete.

05:30.132 --> 05:32.847
I mean, sneaking around.
You're going to have to go incognito,

05:32.848 --> 05:35.249
you know, very
cloak-and-dagger stuff.

05:35.251 --> 05:37.318
- You know what you need?
- Are you talking about hats?

05:37.320 --> 05:40.323
- Yes, I am. You want some?
- I don't want any.

05:40.324 --> 05:43.423
(whistle blows) Come on, ladies, hustle!
That's pathetic.

05:43.424 --> 05:44.866
Come on, move.

05:44.867 --> 05:47.565
Listen, you don't dive for
a loosball, you do push-ups.

05:47.566 --> 05:50.976
Now, get on the floor. Give me 20.
Come on... What is that?

05:50.977 --> 05:52.807
Come on, what are you,
a little girl?

05:52.808 --> 05:54.176
I think that's exactly what
she is.

05:54.177 --> 05:56.747
Ashley, get back in line.
No more bullshit.

05:56.832 --> 05:59.318
Whoa, you're like a female
Bobby Knight.

05:59.451 --> 06:02.157
- Bobby Knight's a pussy.
- Okay.

06:02.158 --> 06:04.267
I'm Kevin MacArthur.
I'm Ellie's father.

06:04.268 --> 06:05.418
Why are you here?

06:05.444 --> 06:07.884
I think, uh... I think Ellie's
having a bit of a problem.

06:07.885 --> 06:11.202
Yeah, I know she is.
What she's bringing is weak shit.

06:11.203 --> 06:12.418
Really?

06:12.455 --> 06:14.688
- Mm-hmm.
- Weak shit...?

06:14.690 --> 06:16.419
Look, that's a
trick shot.

06:16.445 --> 06:18.303
She get that weak
shit from you?

06:18.304 --> 06:21.475
No, my shit is not weak.
My shit is... strong.

06:21.476 --> 06:24.134
Want to show me your "strong?"
Drop down and give me 20 right now.

06:24.135 --> 06:26.301
(Kevin laughs) I'm not going
to give you 20. No.

06:26.302 --> 06:27.814
- Get down!
- All right, I'm a man...

06:27.815 --> 06:28.898
Let's go! Let's go!

06:28.899 --> 06:31.524
I could probably give you two or three
really good ones in a row, so...

06:31.525 --> 06:32.936
Here we go.

06:32.962 --> 06:34.475
(grunting)

06:34.476 --> 06:37.752
- (straining): One.
- That's pathetic.

06:37.753 --> 06:40.913
Tell your daughter no more weak shit.
She's got to lean in.

06:40.914 --> 06:42.060
Coach Crowley,

06:42.061 --> 06:45.637
I'd like to file a complaint with how
you've been treating Chloe lately.

06:45.638 --> 06:47.264
What the hell is this, a
PTA meeting?

06:47.265 --> 06:48.672
- Get on the floor!
- Okay.

06:48.673 --> 06:51.781
Come on, if you want to be in
my gym, you got to sweat.

06:51.827 --> 06:53.690
- This is insane.
- Own it.

06:53.691 --> 06:56.478
Are you kidding? This is the third time
I've been here to complain this week.

06:56.479 --> 06:57.458
Why?

06:57.459 --> 06:59.626
It reminds me of the best
parts about being in prison.

06:59.627 --> 07:00.934
Come on, let's go!

07:00.935 --> 07:03.798
Yeah, I started making vodka
in my basement toilet.

07:03.824 --> 07:06.173
- Oh, my God.
- That's weak!

07:07.462 --> 07:10.918
Babe, I'm home.
How did it go, talking to Ellie's coach?

07:10.919 --> 07:14.849
Um, I got to be honest with you,
I kind of think that she has a point.

07:14.850 --> 07:17.793
I think that she's motivating these
girls to become better athletes.

07:17.794 --> 07:18.995
They need to lean in.

07:18.996 --> 07:20.558
- Lean in?
- Yeah, lean in.

07:20.559 --> 07:22.002
"Lean in" is
meaningless.

07:22.003 --> 07:24.308
That is the white-collar version
of "get 'er done," okay?

07:24.309 --> 07:25.276
No.

07:25.277 --> 07:28.116
You got to get back over there
and talk to her.

07:28.117 --> 07:29.925
She is being too
hard on them.

07:29.926 --> 07:31.818
I mean, if you want me
to talk to her again, I guess...

07:31.844 --> 07:33.646
You know what, fine,
I'll go over and talk to her.

07:33.672 --> 07:35.819
- No, I'll talk to her again.
- (groans): Oh, my God, okay.

07:35.845 --> 07:38.872
Ah, that's really great to see you guys
on the same page in your marriage.

07:38.874 --> 07:42.358
- How is married life for you, Peter?
- It's incredibly frustrating right now.

07:42.359 --> 07:44.617
I can't meet her here, I can't
meet her there...

07:44.618 --> 07:46.852
Sounds like you need
a super-secret plan... you know,

07:46.853 --> 07:49.909
follow her into her dress shop, wait
until she goes into the dressing room,

07:49.910 --> 07:51.452
then you follow behind
and you slam the door...

07:51.454 --> 07:53.454
- You look at her...
- Okay, hold on a second.

07:53.456 --> 07:55.456
- Andre, Andre...
- ...you cup her breasts...

07:55.458 --> 07:58.025
- All right, enough!
- Are you reading Danielle Steel again?

07:58.027 --> 08:00.484
Well, I haven't stopped.
You know, I like to complete an author.

08:00.485 --> 08:02.463
She's got, like, 178 books!

08:02.465 --> 08:04.531
What's wrong about reading a book
that can make you moist?

08:04.532 --> 08:07.262
(disgusted groans)
I can't say "moist"?

08:07.263 --> 08:10.631
- No!
- "Moist" is the classy "wet."

08:10.632 --> 08:12.732
(disgusted groans)
You don't know...

08:12.733 --> 08:14.900
- Stop! You know what?
- Okay, fine.

08:14.901 --> 08:16.484
Let me explain to you the
modern-day affair.

08:16.485 --> 08:18.852
It's about, she tells me she's
going to the gym,

08:18.853 --> 08:21.959
I have to drive 50 minutes across
town, through traffic, to get there.

08:21.984 --> 08:25.399
- It's extremely complicated.
- Doesn't seem that complicated for <i>her.</i>

08:25.400 --> 08:27.621
I don't think you are her first, Pete...

08:27.623 --> 08:30.324
She didn't break the seal
of adultery on you.

08:30.326 --> 08:33.099
- You're not that special.
- Um, excuse me, you don't know her.

08:33.100 --> 08:35.366
- Georgia is a very nice person...
- I'm sure she is...

08:35.368 --> 08:38.756
She happens to be unhappy in her
marriage, but she's promised me

08:38.756 --> 08:41.515
that I am the first man that she's ever
slept with outside of her marriage.

08:41.517 --> 08:44.938
(loud laughter)

08:44.940 --> 08:46.704
Oh, and why is this so funny?

08:46.730 --> 08:48.409
Okay. You know
what, that is

08:48.411 --> 08:51.278
the female version of "Officer,
I swear to God she looked 18."

08:51.280 --> 08:53.387
Enough, all right? I'm not gonna
sit here and listen to this

08:53.388 --> 08:55.823
just 'cause you guys are jealous
that I'm having a great time.

08:55.849 --> 08:57.704
No, I'm sure she's
telling you the truth.

08:57.730 --> 08:58.986
She's not lying to you.

08:58.988 --> 09:01.188
She's never lied to anyone
except her husband, children,

09:01.190 --> 09:04.658
family, in-laws, everyone else
she feels is sacred in her life.

09:04.660 --> 09:08.097
(Peter mumbling)
Jesus Christ, Andre!

09:08.098 --> 09:10.136
- I have a proposition for you.
- Okay.

09:10.137 --> 09:13.544
I live close to Georgia's
gym, and I was thinking maybe

09:13.545 --> 09:16.336
you might want to use my place
as your love nest.

09:16.338 --> 09:18.367
Sure. Also, what is the
catch?

09:18.368 --> 09:19.694
Maybe a trade.

09:19.741 --> 09:21.762
A trade? Well, let me see
what you have in mind.

09:21.763 --> 09:25.379
Okay, look, right after I traded
to Jenny, Reggie Wayn got hurt.

09:25.381 --> 09:27.881
My wide receiver corps sucks,
all right?

09:27.883 --> 09:30.517
All right, well, I'll tell
you what, I do have a pretty

09:30.519 --> 09:33.120
shitty stable of running backs,
so if you get me Le'Veon Bell...

09:33.122 --> 09:35.122
Wait. I gave you my
apartment.

09:35.124 --> 09:37.124
Andre, it's not a trade unless
you give me a player as well.

09:37.126 --> 09:38.726
Yeah, but I did you a fav...

09:38.728 --> 09:41.161
- Fine, what do you got?
- I'll give you Jordy Nelson,

09:41.163 --> 09:44.262
- I'll give you Julio Jones...
- Julio Jo... Isn't he on the I.R.?

09:44.270 --> 09:46.077
The designated I.R.,

09:46.078 --> 09:49.203
which means he will be coming back
for your big playoff push, all right?

09:49.205 --> 09:52.248
- I don't know.
- Andre, this is such a win for you, okay?

09:52.249 --> 09:55.271
You get Jordy Nelson, you get
the definitely-coming-back Julio Jones,

09:55.310 --> 10:00.775
<i>and</i> you get to be my adultery
accomplice... all for Le'Veon Bell?

10:00.776 --> 10:04.151
- Well, my friend, you have a deal.
- Nice! All right...

10:04.153 --> 10:05.672
Oh, already shook on it.
All good.

10:05.673 --> 10:07.219
(Andre chuckles)
(quietly): Sucker.

10:07.447 --> 10:08.694
(quietly): Sucker.

10:08.719 --> 10:11.402
♪ ♪

10:14.779 --> 10:18.331
Hey! No! Wait! Security!
Help me! He's got my purse!

10:18.334 --> 10:21.168
Security! Whoo!
Security number one!

10:21.170 --> 10:23.031
- Whoo! Go team!
- What are you doing?

10:23.032 --> 10:24.312
(chants): Security! Security!

10:24.313 --> 10:25.873
Come on, you
guys, move!

10:25.875 --> 10:28.674
- What did I tell you, huh?
- Move, you little maggots, move!

10:28.675 --> 10:30.147
This is incredible...
I'm getting season tickets.

10:30.148 --> 10:31.286
This is the best
show in town.

10:31.287 --> 10:33.748
What is this?
You're sleepwalking. Come on.

10:33.749 --> 10:35.902
I don't know, I'm just not
into the tshik-zilla thing.

10:35.903 --> 10:39.154
Guess my type is more of just a tiny
Latin woman who obliterates me.

10:39.179 --> 10:40.592
(blows whistle)

10:41.966 --> 10:43.450
What was that, guys?

10:43.451 --> 10:45.316
Yes! Sorry. Wow....

10:45.317 --> 10:47.487
I don't know, I just can't see
beyond her wrath.

10:47.488 --> 10:49.858
You... I... I just see
beyond the jacket...

10:49.884 --> 10:53.022
- What are you guys doing here?
- You told me to talk to the coach.

10:53.286 --> 10:56.120
You need to get low and move,
like we practiced.

10:56.121 --> 10:57.682
You didn't even
listen to me.

10:57.683 --> 11:00.074
Oh... I get it.

11:00.075 --> 11:03.812
"Lean in" is actually just about
seeing Coach's cleavage, right?

11:03.813 --> 11:06.580
No. I was defending her
because I feel like she's

11:06.582 --> 11:08.763
motivating Ellie to become
a better athlete; it's working.

11:08.764 --> 11:13.030
Really? Has nothing to do with the
fact that she's just a little bit hot?

11:13.031 --> 11:15.277
No, it's a lot bit because
she's terrifying.

11:15.303 --> 11:16.623
- I can't even look at you.
- She is terrifying.

11:16.625 --> 11:19.326
She's, like, right out of a <i>Saw</i>
<i>movie.</i>

11:19.328 --> 11:21.013
- Pussies.
- Feel the burn.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.181
Hey, babe. I will see you in
a couple of minutes, okay?

11:23.182 --> 11:25.502
Maybe in the lobby.
Hi. Jenny MacArthur.

11:25.503 --> 11:28.166
How are you? I was hoping I could
talk to you about my daughter...

11:28.192 --> 11:29.882
Listen, lady, make
an appointment.

11:29.908 --> 11:32.348
Oh, um, well, you know,
I'm right here, so...

11:32.349 --> 11:34.856
And she's having a really tough time,
and I was just hoping we could talk.

11:34.857 --> 11:37.191
Oh, okay, I see where your
daughter learned to whine.

11:37.192 --> 11:38.058
What?

11:38.059 --> 11:40.310
I thought she got her lack of sack
from your husband,

11:40.311 --> 11:43.121
but she's got no sack
because you've got no sack.

11:43.122 --> 11:46.623
- Oh-ho. I have sack.
- Oh, yeah?

11:46.624 --> 11:50.757
- I got a really big sack.
- Mm-hmm? Yeah, you have a big...

11:50.759 --> 11:53.825
- Hairy lady's sack?
- Okay, now she's my type.

11:53.826 --> 11:57.432
Yeah. In fact, I bet my sack
is bigger than your sack, Coach.

11:57.433 --> 11:59.032
Well, then sack up, Ms. MacArthur.

11:59.034 --> 12:01.368
I'm telling you, I got
a full-on anger chub right now.

12:01.370 --> 12:03.154
- Move over.
- Wind sprints. Now.

12:03.155 --> 12:04.988
- What?
- Now! Go!

12:05.128 --> 12:08.619
- O... O... Okay.
- Come on, faster, let's go.

12:08.620 --> 12:09.964
What is my wife doing?

12:09.965 --> 12:13.038
I believe she's showing us
all her giant, hairy sack.

12:13.155 --> 12:15.820
Stacking up, huh?
Let's go, show me that sack.

12:15.821 --> 12:18.165
This... is my sack.

12:18.270 --> 12:22.872
This is my big... hairy lady
sack.

12:22.873 --> 12:29.111
Huh? Huh? Yeah!
That's my sack. Suck it!

12:29.325 --> 12:32.226
I'm about to show y'all
what's inside my sack.

12:34.358 --> 12:39.640
All right, well, I hope these terrible
furnishings don't ruin the mood.

12:39.642 --> 12:42.194
You know, I have to pick my daughter up
in an hour... I'm not worried about mood.

12:42.195 --> 12:45.306
Oh, we're just... we're going?
I like it. Let's just go for it.

12:45.370 --> 12:47.370
(chuckles) The bedroom's right
this way.

12:47.371 --> 12:51.006
Bonjour. Welcome
to Cafe de la Andre.

12:51.007 --> 12:53.374
- I've cooked up some <i>huevos.</i>
- Who is this guy?

12:53.375 --> 12:55.909
I'm the accomplice.
Nice to meet you, Georgia.

12:55.934 --> 12:58.718
- How does he know my name?
- I'm sorry. Mrs. Thompson.

12:59.255 --> 13:01.756
Andre, you said I could use
your "love nest."

13:01.757 --> 13:04.390
It's not a love nest when there's already
another bird in it, do you understand?

13:04.391 --> 13:07.530
Yeah, but this bird is blind and deaf...
I won't hear a thing.

13:07.531 --> 13:10.537
This is incredibly inappropriate.
I mean, what... You made food?

13:10.539 --> 13:13.163
- What are we doing?
- It's a little postcoital snack.

13:13.164 --> 13:14.245
(disgusted groans)

13:14.246 --> 13:16.813
Look, I support what you guys
are doing.

13:16.814 --> 13:18.867
It's very European.

13:18.868 --> 13:20.558
Europeans are liberal,
they're not creepy.

13:20.559 --> 13:22.684
I know a lot of creepy Europeans.

13:22.710 --> 13:25.786
- You should come to my squash club.
- All right, you need to go.

13:25.788 --> 13:27.421
- Where do you want me to go?
- Away! Out...

13:27.423 --> 13:29.423
- Hey.
- Hi.

13:29.425 --> 13:31.892
Andre, what the hell
are they doing?

13:31.894 --> 13:34.614
I just realized, I... kind of
double-booked.

13:34.615 --> 13:35.848
You double-booked?

13:35.849 --> 13:38.072
Yeah, they're coming over
to see the Bulls game...

13:38.073 --> 13:39.099
Great. Hi.

13:39.101 --> 13:41.368
...and they were coming over
to celebrate their love...

13:41.370 --> 13:45.272
No...! Guys, this is my...
Yah! This is my good friend...

13:45.274 --> 13:47.274
- Georgia.
- Hi. Hi. Georgia.

13:47.276 --> 13:50.811
Hi, friend. Friend Jenny.
I'm also friends with him.

13:50.813 --> 13:53.814
- Not that way.
- No. Not in that way.

13:53.816 --> 13:56.475
Uh, what do you
do, Georgia?

13:56.476 --> 13:58.967
When I'm not using my marriage
vows as toilet paper?

13:58.993 --> 14:00.617
You know, let's get out
of here, let's go.

14:00.643 --> 14:02.564
- We should probably go.
- No. No. No, no, no, no, stay, stay.

14:02.594 --> 14:04.694
- I am sorry.
- Not gonna happen.

14:04.696 --> 14:07.015
- All right, next Thursday?
- Next time.

14:07.016 --> 14:08.216
Okay.

14:09.037 --> 14:10.632
Nice to meet you.

14:10.633 --> 14:13.777
Wow, Pete, she is
a real keeper.

14:13.778 --> 14:16.539
Is what her husband must have thought
when he pledged his life to her.

14:16.540 --> 14:19.774
Thank you. Andre, what the hell happened
to the whole cloak-and-dagger thing?

14:19.775 --> 14:21.860
Well, I got the cloak.
I just forgot the dagger.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.928
Andre, I need you to pick up
some more condoms, please.

14:23.929 --> 14:25.426
Oh. You triple booked?

14:25.453 --> 14:28.157
- Him, I did not know about.
- Ooh, eggs.

14:28.158 --> 14:31.630
The biggest shocker in this moment
is that Taco uses condoms.

14:35.543 --> 14:37.769
So, you're still sticking
with the jacket thing?

14:37.770 --> 14:39.690
What can I say?
I'm a die-hard fan.

14:39.692 --> 14:42.719
You should see the guy at the bank...
he wears the whole outfit all day long.

14:42.745 --> 14:43.727
Okay.

14:43.729 --> 14:45.796
- Ooh, Good. Phew!
- Excuse me?

14:45.798 --> 14:47.998
- Oh, my God!
- What are you doing?

14:48.001 --> 14:49.047
- Oh, my hair?
- Yeah.

14:49.048 --> 14:52.000
- It's a wig. Yeah, it's a wig.
- No!

14:52.026 --> 14:54.669
Why does your wig look
exactly like Pete's hair?

14:54.670 --> 14:56.705
Because it's light,
it's breezy, it's fun.

14:56.706 --> 14:58.333
Like a Nancy
Meyers movie?

14:58.334 --> 15:00.301
Yeah. You'd love to see this
wig's kitchen.

15:00.303 --> 15:02.296
I don't understand why
you're wearing a wig.

15:02.297 --> 15:04.869
Pete and I should both
be wearing wigs, okay?

15:04.870 --> 15:07.984
He's out there having an affair
with this married woman.

15:07.985 --> 15:12.513
This husband could find him at any second,
and me... I'm an adultery accomplice.

15:12.514 --> 15:15.540
- Who knows what's coming into my world?
- No, that's not it.

15:15.542 --> 15:19.043
- You just anted an excuse to buy a wig.
- I could grow this at any time.

15:19.044 --> 15:20.097
ALL: Really?

15:20.098 --> 15:21.840
- Yes.
- Why don't you let it grow?

15:21.841 --> 15:23.756
I keep it tight like Jay Glazer.

15:23.757 --> 15:26.855
Come on, you're as transparent as
the clear hair that you don't have.

15:26.856 --> 15:28.827
What is this shit?
Trade rejected?

15:28.828 --> 15:31.136
I don't know. I guess it just
had the votes to get vetoed.

15:31.137 --> 15:33.255
That was a completely fair trade.
How could you...?

15:33.256 --> 15:35.421
- Jesus Christ, what are you...?
- What?

15:36.814 --> 15:38.148
BOTH: Are you...?

15:38.187 --> 15:40.674
- It's the real thing.
- I can't even deal with this right now.

15:40.675 --> 15:43.109
- Quiet. Who vetoed my trade?
- I did.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.494
- BOTH: Why?
- Because I don't like what you're doing?

15:45.495 --> 15:47.217
BOTH: What? Stop.

15:47.249 --> 15:50.658
I don't agree with what you've
done to the sanctity of marriage.

15:50.684 --> 15:53.094
- Because it's not right?
- No, because it's not fair.

15:53.107 --> 15:54.237
I mean, it's bad
enough that you

15:54.239 --> 15:57.855
flaunt not being married in our
face, but now you're peeing all

15:57.856 --> 16:02.709
over an actual marriage, so I've
decided to take a thick, hot,

16:02.710 --> 16:06.216
dehydrated, yellow, ropey pee
all over your trade.

16:06.217 --> 16:08.857
This has nothing to do with
fantasy football.

16:08.858 --> 16:11.454
You guys are vetoing my
relationship with Georgia.

16:11.455 --> 16:12.975
- Stop it, Andre.
- Okay.

16:12.976 --> 16:15.370
There is no space for morality
in this league. I'm out.

16:15.371 --> 16:18.629
Pass the tissues.
We all got issues.

16:18.903 --> 16:21.137
I really find Hair Andre less
annoying.

16:21.139 --> 16:23.539
You guys have to box out.
Get back.

16:23.541 --> 16:27.114
That's just terrible!
Come on, what is this?!

16:27.115 --> 16:29.708
Wow, she is erotically
disapproving.

16:29.709 --> 16:32.109
Goddamn it, knew I shouldn't
have taken the over.

16:32.110 --> 16:33.789
- What <i>is</i> the over?
- Eight.

16:33.790 --> 16:36.057
- Speaking of scores...
- Go on, take it in.

16:36.058 --> 16:37.781
...I am kicking
your ass.

16:37.782 --> 16:39.698
As long as Pete loses,
I'm still in the playoffs.

16:39.699 --> 16:43.285
Babe, they gave us the team photo.
Check this out.

16:43.286 --> 16:44.290
Oh, my God!

16:44.316 --> 16:46.538
Yeah, looks like a basketball
internment camp.

16:46.564 --> 16:49.745
They're a bunch of hostages
sitting there. She's such a bitch!

16:49.746 --> 16:52.369
- That is full-on shtetl porn.
- Ladies, that's pathetic bullshit!

16:52.370 --> 16:54.079
You see how disapproving she
looks?

16:54.080 --> 16:56.556
Goddamn it, I hate you all.
You're not my friends anymore.

16:56.557 --> 16:58.360
- BOTH: Oh.
- This is unbelievable.

16:58.361 --> 17:01.168
I was not able to pick up Le'Veon Bell,
so what do I have to do?

17:01.169 --> 17:03.435
I start Chris Ivory
who gives me shit?

17:03.436 --> 17:05.743
Now, I will not go
to the playoffs

17:05.744 --> 17:08.061
because you don't like
that my girlfriend is married.

17:08.063 --> 17:09.896
Whoa, whoa, whoa, shh.
I wouldn't speak too loud.

17:09.897 --> 17:12.414
Mrs. Thompson's over there with
her husband.

17:12.415 --> 17:14.840
I guess her daughter plays for
the opposing team.

17:14.842 --> 17:16.775
- Move, you little maggots!
- Come on, what is this?!

17:16.777 --> 17:19.211
- Oh. Hey, Georgia.
- Shh!

17:19.213 --> 17:21.113
- Taco, cut it out.
- Jesus Christ! All right.

17:21.115 --> 17:23.348
- Don't... don't look. Don't look.
- Box out!

17:23.351 --> 17:25.351
- Get back on defense, guys.
- Oh. Uh-oh.

17:25.353 --> 17:27.252
We're just sitting here
talking, and nothing is hap...

17:27.255 --> 17:28.640
Uh-oh. No, no, no.
He's looking at us.

17:28.641 --> 17:31.317
Jenny, make out with me real quick,
'cause it'll look like we're together.

17:31.318 --> 17:32.608
God, I'm not gonna
make out with you.

17:32.609 --> 17:34.475
Fine. I'll jump on the grenade, Jenny.
Let's make out.

17:34.476 --> 17:35.993
No, Taco, I'm not making out
with you, either.

17:35.994 --> 17:37.961
I mean, why don't you guys just
make out with each other, right?

17:37.962 --> 17:39.962
He's not... Hold on.
I'll tell you if he's looking.

17:39.963 --> 17:42.009
- Where'd he go?
- Joey, who are you guarding?

17:43.272 --> 17:45.993
- Do you know someone over there?
- No.

17:45.994 --> 17:48.540
We're gonna smile, and
we're not gonna look.

17:48.541 --> 17:50.905
- Come on, ladies, hustle.
- That's pathetic.

17:51.735 --> 17:54.448
- Hello. This is Tony Thompson.
- Hi, Mr. Thompson.

17:54.449 --> 17:56.664
This is Ann Marie from Fraud
Early Warning.

17:56.672 --> 17:59.979
There's been quite a few purchases
on your account recently

17:59.980 --> 18:02.326
from Jimmy Cheffo's
Meatball Experience,

18:02.327 --> 18:04.828
<i>which makes us think that your card
might have been compromised.</i>

18:04.829 --> 18:07.529
Jimmy...? No. Jimmy Cheffo's?
I've never eaten at that dump.

18:07.530 --> 18:10.698
Oh, well, it looks like your wife
Georgia's name is also on the card.

18:10.699 --> 18:12.900
Maybe she ate there without you.

18:12.901 --> 18:15.712
You're telling me that my wife
ate at Jimmy Cheffo's?

18:15.713 --> 18:18.413
Why would she do that? We're foodies.
We don't eat at places like that.

18:18.414 --> 18:19.858
We could be watching <i>High Life</i>
for all I know.

18:19.859 --> 18:22.394
- Seriously. It's crazy.
- Come on, move!

18:22.395 --> 18:25.639
- Cheffo, Cheffo, Cheffo.
- Oh, it's so good.

18:25.640 --> 18:27.294
- Oh!
- Son of a bitch.

18:27.295 --> 18:30.129
You know, Tony, based on your
purchasing history,

18:30.155 --> 18:31.965
she's very lucky to have you.

18:31.966 --> 18:33.197
I have to go.

18:35.856 --> 18:38.434
- Oh, shit.
- I can't believe you, Georgia.

18:38.435 --> 18:40.941
Hey? Hey, scumbag!

18:41.160 --> 18:43.635
- Oh, shit.
- You, scumbag, you screwing my wife?

18:43.636 --> 18:45.929
You having a meatball experience
with my wife?

18:45.957 --> 18:47.957
- Tony, just settle down.
- I'm not gonna settle down.

18:47.958 --> 18:50.427
- Stand up.
- Security, security, stand up.

18:50.428 --> 18:51.708
- Sit down, shit bag.
- Yup.

18:51.709 --> 18:53.330
- You... let's go.
- You know what?

18:53.331 --> 18:55.297
- We're gonna talk about this.
- Talk about this?

18:55.298 --> 18:57.531
- I don't think so, asshole.
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Okay.

18:57.794 --> 19:00.509
Come back here,
you chicken shit!

19:00.510 --> 19:04.830
- Wow. This is so embarrassing.
- Your husband's a real dick.

19:04.831 --> 19:07.946
- He is, isn't he?
- That's an expensive-looking sandwich.

19:08.463 --> 19:11.801
For the record,
she made the first move!

19:11.802 --> 19:14.036
I don't give a shit!

19:16.397 --> 19:17.872
- Oh...
- Oh, God.

19:17.873 --> 19:19.070
Hey...
Oh, Jesus.

19:19.071 --> 19:21.731
You wanking in the closet to the
team picture? Come on!

19:21.732 --> 19:25.103
I'm blocking the kids. I'm just
locked in on that coach's death stare.

19:25.104 --> 19:27.545
- Where are you, asshole?
- Shh! Stop! Stop!

19:27.546 --> 19:29.616
I can't! The jack
train's left the station.

19:29.617 --> 19:33.195
- Have some self-respect, Ruxin.
- Next stop is vinegar stroke Central.

19:33.196 --> 19:34.301
- Stop it!
- I can't!

19:34.302 --> 19:35.429
- Stop!
- Too late!

19:35.430 --> 19:37.430
(both groaning)

19:40.531 --> 19:43.176
(both sighing) Oh, those
clackers are really meaty.

19:43.177 --> 19:45.016
They were meatier
a minute ago.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.267
(Pete yells)

19:46.268 --> 19:48.635
(Ruxin sighs) (panting)

19:49.763 --> 19:51.394
Clean-up on Aisle Me.

19:52.137 --> 19:53.397
(panting)

19:54.369 --> 19:56.556
Where'd you go, pussy?

19:57.236 --> 19:59.702
Yes. Gonna make
the playoffs.

19:59.703 --> 20:01.546
(grunting) Dick!

20:02.054 --> 20:03.404
Oh, shit.

20:03.405 --> 20:06.342
(Andre groans)
I'm just the accomplice.

20:09.308 --> 20:11.160
(thudding)

20:11.186 --> 20:14.100
Hello? Hello?

20:14.429 --> 20:16.595
(moaning)
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

20:16.720 --> 20:18.650
Andre, what are you doing
here?

20:18.651 --> 20:20.651
What? This is my bedroom.
What are you doing here?

20:20.652 --> 20:23.611
Having sex with a woman.
Maybe you should try it some time.

20:23.612 --> 20:25.600
- Hey.
- By the way, I found this.

20:25.601 --> 20:28.145
- What...?
- Get back in the kitchen where you belong.

20:28.146 --> 20:30.079
- Make us some eggs, bitch.
- Wait a second.

20:30.080 --> 20:32.805
- I could be your adultery accomplice.
- Over easy.

20:32.806 --> 20:34.105
Benedict.

20:34.106 --> 20:36.400
All right, this is great.
These are gonna be the best eggs...

20:36.401 --> 20:37.764
- Just make it quick.
- Okay.

20:37.765 --> 20:39.381
Oh, there's a steam
shower function in the...

20:39.382 --> 20:41.381
- Out!
- Okay, got it. Oils.
