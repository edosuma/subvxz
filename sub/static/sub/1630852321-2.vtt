That's so cute.

01:40.535 --> 01:42.014
- I do, but I'm gonna get
a spoon and a larger cup.

Do you get up early?

03:11.408 --> 03:12.540
- Not really, no.

03:12.583 --> 03:14.368
I basically--I wake up
around 8:00,

03:14.411 --> 03:16.848

who she really is.

03:28.469 --> 03:30.819
Good morning.
- How are you?

03:30.862 --> 03:33.256
- Did John call you last night?
- No.

03:33.300 --> 03:34.953
- Did you want him to?
- No.

03:34.997 --> 03:36.912
- So what's the deal?
I sense some chemistry.

03:36.955 --> 03:38.696
- You think?
- You into him a little bit?

03:38.740 --> 03:40.611
'Cause you guys--
- I think he's a nice guy.

03:40.655 --> 03:42.265
- You don't think
he's attractive?

03:42.309 --> 03:44.136
- Yeah, he's nice,
but, you know, we'll see.

03:44.180 --> 03:45.529
- Well, we have,
what, six more days?

03:45.573 --> 03:47.575
I think you should
shoot your shot.

03:47.618 --> 03:49.881
- Pardon?
- Meaning you should go for it.

03:49.925 --> 03:51.579
- Yeah.

03:51.622 --> 03:53.102
- But jokes aside,
are you actually interested?

03:53.145 --> 03:54.886
- You know, I don't know.
- He was really nice.

03:54.930 --> 03:56.801
- If something happens, great.
Something doesn't, it doesn't.

03:56.845 --> 03:58.412
- How long were you married?
- Excuse me, can I have...

03:58.455 --> 04:00.196
- Over 20 years.
- Half and half?

04:00.240 --> 04:01.371
- That's a long marriage.
- Thank you.

04:01.415 --> 04:02.590
- How did you guys meet?

04:02.633 --> 04:04.287
- He used to watch my butt
in the gym.

04:04.331 --> 04:05.854
- Nice.
- No, that's what he said.

04:05.897 --> 04:07.203
'Cause I was always
working out.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.813
Anyway, I was at
my local restaurant Ciao Bella.

04:08.857 --> 04:10.206
It was like the hotspot
in town. Like...

04:10.250 --> 04:11.555
- Mm-hmm.

04:11.599 --> 04:12.730
- So I was waiting at the bar
for my table,

04:12.774 --> 04:14.384
and he said,
"I know you from the gym."

04:14.428 --> 04:15.951
- Morning.
- Hi, how are you?

04:15.994 --> 04:18.127
- He goes, "You are the girl
who wears the black G-string

04:18.170 --> 04:19.607
with the green ruffle."

04:19.650 --> 04:21.304
I was a trendsetter,
so whenever I would get, like--

04:21.348 --> 04:22.479
- Come on!
- The neon colors--

04:22.523 --> 04:23.828
- A trendsetter.
- I was, it's true.

04:23.872 --> 04:25.439
<i>I was in the fashion business.</i>

04:25.482 --> 04:26.788
<i>I mean, I spent
so much money on clothes.</i>

04:26.831 --> 04:28.311
<i>You know, I was Miss Versace.</i>

04:28.355 --> 04:29.573
Whatever outfit I come in in,

04:29.617 --> 04:30.792
all of a sudden,
I see everyone.

04:30.835 --> 04:32.097
I would start with a crop top
like that.

04:32.141 --> 04:33.273
No one was wearing it.

04:33.316 --> 04:34.448
- You started wearing
crop tops first?

04:34.491 --> 04:36.145
- Very fashionable.

04:36.188 --> 04:38.713
- In the gym.
Got it, got it. got it, got it.

04:38.756 --> 04:40.758
<i>- Ramona looks amazing
for her age,</i>

04:40.802 --> 04:43.065
but she's definitely
not a trendsetter.

04:43.108 --> 04:45.415
- You started a global trend

04:45.459 --> 04:49.201
because you wore it
at your local gym.

04:49.245 --> 04:50.986
Okay.
- It's Ramona's world,

04:51.029 --> 04:52.379
and we all just ----ing
live in it.

04:52.422 --> 04:53.554
- Wow.

04:53.597 --> 04:55.295
- You have very high
self-esteem.

04:55.338 --> 04:56.383
- Good morning, everybody.

04:56.426 --> 04:57.775
- Sunshine.

04:57.819 --> 04:59.342
- Are you guys dressed
in clothes?

04:59.386 --> 05:00.822
Oh, my God.
- No.

05:00.865 --> 05:03.303
- In order for me to go
and have fun today,

05:03.346 --> 05:04.913
I had to be able
to sleep a little bit.

05:04.956 --> 05:07.219
- You came the farthest,
so understandable.

05:07.263 --> 05:08.482
- Good morning.
- Hi.

05:08.525 --> 05:09.744
- Oh, look at you
with your golf gloves.

05:09.787 --> 05:10.962
Or are those tennis gloves?

05:11.006 --> 05:12.312
- No, tennis,
to protect my hands.

05:12.355 --> 05:13.661
- Wow.
- In the sun.

05:13.704 --> 05:15.445
All right, guys.
I'll see you in a little bit.

05:15.489 --> 05:17.447
- Oh, go play tennis.
Not with me.

05:17.491 --> 05:18.622
You don't want to play with me.

05:18.666 --> 05:20.102
- Come the last 20 minutes.

05:20.145 --> 05:21.886
- Well, Kenya and I are gonna
have a match together.

05:21.930 --> 05:23.671
- Okay.
- All right, I'm gonna change.

05:23.714 --> 05:24.976
I'll meet you back down here,
like, soon.

05:25.020 --> 05:26.543
- I'm gonna be ten minutes.
- Okay.

05:26.587 --> 05:28.066
- But listen,
I'm using the court

05:28.110 --> 05:29.677
for the first 40 minutes.
You get the last 20.

05:29.720 --> 05:32.070
- Ramona, oh, my gosh.

05:32.114 --> 05:34.595
- Everyone is, like, in shock

05:34.638 --> 05:38.076
over how Ramona is
so about Ramona.

05:38.120 --> 05:39.469
<i>- Are you a major player?</i>

05:39.513 --> 05:41.341
- No.
That's why I want to play.

05:41.384 --> 05:43.647
She won't let me play tennis
'cause I'm not good at it.

05:43.691 --> 05:46.389
- I need a workout.
Sorry, I'm being selfish now.

05:46.433 --> 05:47.912
- We're all
on vacation together.

05:47.956 --> 05:50.611
We are not at Ramona's villa.
Like, she needs to share.

05:50.654 --> 05:52.090
- You didn't book it.
I did.

05:52.134 --> 05:54.005
So I'm doing it first,
and then you can do it after.

05:57.052 --> 05:58.488
- Who made this one
the boss of tennis?

05:58.532 --> 06:01.491
- It's concierge,
not "conch-ierge."

06:01.535 --> 06:04.102
It's a French word. Concierge.

06:04.146 --> 06:06.191
- Thank you for correcting me.
- Who raised her?

06:06.235 --> 06:07.410

That was generous.

06:21.903 --> 06:23.644
What's the way to get out
to the tennis court?

06:23.687 --> 06:24.732

I don't even know what I did

06:30.085 --> 06:31.608

06:31.652 --> 06:32.870
I'm like, "Oh, my God."

06:34.089 --> 06:35.699
she doesn't even know
what doubles is.

06:38.485 --> 06:40.182

I'm here just a little late.

06:40.225 --> 06:41.401
I just want to start hitting.

06:41.444 --> 06:43.011

06:55.240 --> 06:56.416

06:56.459 --> 06:57.721
- Neither did I.
- I moved to New York.

06:57.765 --> 06:59.723

to college

06:59.767 --> 07:01.595

like, girlfriends.

07:01.638 --> 07:02.900

- Yeah, that awesome

07:28.273 --> 07:29.492
what you did with Ramona.

07:29.536 --> 07:30.928
- No, 'cause it, like,
pissed me off.

07:30.972 --> 07:33.583
I was like, "We cannot start
this trip like that."

07:33.627 --> 07:34.932
I mean, we're on an island,

07:34.976 --> 07:36.238
but you don't want
to be on an island.

07:36.281 --> 07:37.457
- An island by yourself.
- Like, by yourself.

07:37.500 --> 07:38.501

07:39.720 --> 07:41.286
- Backhand, forehand.

07:41.330 --> 07:42.897
<i>- You know, she has good
intentions, but she just...</i>

07:42.940 --> 07:44.594
- Bam.
- Just is who she is.

07:44.638 --> 07:45.943
<i>It is just what it is.</i>

07:45.987 --> 07:47.641
- Well, don't do it
that far over.

07:47.684 --> 07:48.946
- Approach, come forward.

07:48.990 --> 07:50.774
- No, I want another long shot.

07:50.818 --> 07:52.950
- And Kenya was upset about it
which, you know,

07:52.994 --> 07:55.213
I have to say, I never had
anybody stick up for me.

07:55.257 --> 07:58.521
- To say that about someone
is horrible, Ramona!

07:58.565 --> 07:59.957
- Well, that's the thing
about Kenya.

08:00.001 --> 08:01.698
You know, if she's with you,
she goes hard for you.

08:01.742 --> 08:04.701
- That meant a lot,
because even on my cast,

08:04.745 --> 08:06.311
I don't have that.

08:06.355 --> 08:07.835
- But it feels like you
and Melissa, like--

08:07.878 --> 08:09.489
- No, I don't feel it from her.

08:09.532 --> 08:10.968
<i>- Oh, wow.
- And with us,</i>

08:11.012 --> 08:12.796
there was a lot of turmoil,
like, in the past.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.102
<i>- I am asking you to stop.</i>

08:14.145 --> 08:15.930
- I didn't do nothing to you,
and you know it.

08:15.973 --> 08:17.409
- I'll get on my knees again,
'cause I have no problem...

08:17.453 --> 08:18.498
- Yeah.
- Baby girl.

08:18.541 --> 08:19.586
- Because you know--
- No pride!

08:19.629 --> 08:21.152
- Now, like, I'll never go

08:21.196 --> 08:22.806
to that place with Melissa,
you know?

08:22.850 --> 08:24.416
- Yeah.
- We are in a good place.

08:24.460 --> 08:26.027
<i>But, like,
Melissa could have been like,</i>

08:26.070 --> 08:27.811
<i>"Ramona, you really
don't know Teresa."</i>

08:27.855 --> 08:29.160
I live
by the "Godfather" movie,

08:29.204 --> 08:31.598
and I'm all about loyalty
and respect.

08:31.641 --> 08:33.513
Yeah, and Melissa's
never watched it.

08:33.556 --> 08:35.166
Just saying.

08:35.210 --> 08:37.517
Kenya, like,
really touched me yesterday.

08:37.560 --> 08:38.561
- Yeah.
- She really did.

08:38.605 --> 08:39.780
And I feel bad for her.

08:39.823 --> 08:41.346
Like, she's going
through a divorce,

08:41.390 --> 08:42.652
and I know how it feels.

08:42.696 --> 08:45.089
And her leaving her child
for the first time.

08:45.133 --> 08:46.656
Like, the first time
I left my kids is, like,

08:46.700 --> 08:48.397
when I went away,
when I went to jail,

08:48.440 --> 08:52.357
and, like, that was, like,
the hardest thing, you know.

08:52.401 --> 08:54.011
- 11 months.
- 11 1/2 months.

08:54.055 --> 08:55.535
- 11 1/2.
- And then I came home.

08:55.578 --> 08:57.232
Three months later,
Joe went in,

08:57.275 --> 08:58.581
and then he never came home.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.583
- Not to be too personal.
- Yeah, no, yeah.

09:00.627 --> 09:01.802
- Did you think that you guys

09:01.845 --> 09:03.020
were gonna work it out
when he got out,

09:03.064 --> 09:04.544
or were you guys
pretty much done?

09:04.587 --> 09:07.851
- When I went in, I still
thought it was gonna work out.

09:07.895 --> 09:10.680
When it hit me is, like,
after my mom passed.

09:10.724 --> 09:13.030
I got so resentful.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

09:13.074 --> 09:15.642
- 'Cause I was like,
I lost time with my mom.

09:15.685 --> 09:17.078
And if I didn't go away,

09:17.121 --> 09:18.558
I would have never
lost that time.

09:18.601 --> 09:21.386
And then when he got out,
I was like, "When I see him,

09:21.430 --> 09:22.997
this'll be my true test
when I see if I feel"--

09:23.040 --> 09:26.043
- What was it like...
when you saw him?

09:26.087 --> 09:29.438
- Daddy!

09:29.481 --> 09:31.266
- Hi.
- Oh, yeah.

09:31.309 --> 09:32.659
- How are you?

09:32.702 --> 09:35.270
I didn't feel anything.

09:35.313 --> 09:36.880
- Did you guys...
- I hate to even say this.

09:36.924 --> 09:38.621
- Ever actually have--
- I mean, he laid on top of me.

09:38.665 --> 09:39.622
But, like,
with our clothes on...

09:39.666 --> 09:41.189
- Right.

09:41.232 --> 09:43.583
- And he was trying to kiss me,
and I just didn't--

09:43.626 --> 09:46.063
I couldn't even open my mouth.

09:46.107 --> 09:48.762
I never thought that Joe and I
would ever get divorced,

09:48.805 --> 09:50.067
<i>but we went through a lot.</i>

09:50.111 --> 09:51.503
I was just--
- Disconnected.

09:51.547 --> 09:53.070
- Disconnected, yes.

09:53.114 --> 09:55.682
Our marriage
could not survive that.

09:55.725 --> 09:58.902
- I don't think people realize
who you really are, you know?

09:58.946 --> 10:00.730
- Thanks, but thank God.

10:00.774 --> 10:02.602
- But you're so, like,
strong though.

10:02.645 --> 10:05.735
Teresa Giudice is a real one.
I got mad respect for her.

10:05.779 --> 10:07.345
All the things
that happened to her,

10:07.389 --> 10:11.306
and she came out stronger,
happy, and in love.

10:11.349 --> 10:12.655
- I wrote six books,
four cookbooks.

10:12.699 --> 10:13.830
- Six?

10:13.874 --> 10:15.571
- I'm a four-time
bestselling author,

before I gave birth--

13:42.473 --> 13:44.084
- I was a buyer, too.
- I was a buyer for Macy's.

13:44.127 --> 13:45.476

13:45.520 --> 13:46.826

- Yes, me too.

13:46.869 --> 13:48.001

in Harold square.

13:48.044 --> 13:49.393
- Oh, my God, so did I.

13:49.437 --> 13:50.960
- I worked in handbags.
- Yeah, I worked in--

13:51.004 --> 13:52.222
- Well, because then I went
on the other--

13:52.266 --> 13:54.355
I was a sales rep
for Calvin Klein handbags.

13:54.398 --> 13:56.226
- And then I went
to the other side,

13:56.270 --> 13:58.054
and I worked
for Calvin Klein sportswear.

13:58.098 --> 13:59.534

started off rocky.

- I admit that I said
Teresa is a scarecrow.

14:08.717 --> 14:11.241
Teresa, she reminds me
a little bit of a scarecrow.

14:11.285 --> 14:12.721

14:14.505 --> 14:16.072

14:16.116 --> 14:17.682

14:17.726 --> 14:19.467
'cause to be a buyer
for Macy's is major.

14:19.510 --> 14:22.078
- But it's crazy how much
Ramona and I have in common.

14:22.122 --> 14:23.645
- You know what?
She has brains.

14:23.688 --> 14:25.255
<i>- She just needed
to get to know me.</i>

14:25.299 --> 14:27.083
<i>- You have to be really smart
to be a buyer.</i>

14:27.127 --> 14:29.869
There's a lot of math
involved there.

14:29.912 --> 14:31.000

14:31.044 --> 14:32.132
Every time I have
one drink here,

14:32.175 --> 14:33.568

14:33.611 --> 14:34.786

14:34.830 --> 14:36.005
I feel like I need three more.

14:36.049 --> 14:37.528
- Really?

14:37.572 --> 14:39.966
No, like, Kenya and I only had,
like, a drink and a half

14:40.009 --> 14:41.184
last night, and we were, like--

14:41.228 --> 14:42.359
- You a lightweight?

14:42.403 --> 14:43.404
- Yeah.
- Yeah, she is.

14:43.447 --> 14:45.014
- I am definitely
a lightweight.

14:45.058 --> 14:46.320
- She's a good drunk though.
- Who's a drunk?

14:46.363 --> 14:47.930
Are you talking about me?

14:47.974 --> 14:49.671
- No, no, no.

14:49.714 --> 14:51.803
- Being on a catamaran
is super sporty,

14:51.847 --> 14:53.240
<i>and I love being on the water,</i>

14:53.283 --> 14:55.459
so it's kinda easy
not to drink.

14:55.503 --> 14:57.722
<i>God knows, a lot of people
get sloppy when they drink,</i>

14:57.766 --> 14:59.072
<i>so when I get tempted</i>

14:59.115 --> 15:00.421
<i>I just think
about those moments,</i>

15:00.464 --> 15:02.118
and it's not so attractive.

15:02.162 --> 15:04.512
who do you feel like you knew

15:04.555 --> 15:06.470
the least coming in,
and now you know them better?

15:06.514 --> 15:08.342
- I feel like I knew
Luann the least...

15:08.385 --> 15:09.734
- Right.
- And I adore her.

15:09.778 --> 15:10.866
- Aw, I like you, too, Kyle.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.128
- Oh, this is so pretty.
Look at this.

15:12.172 --> 15:14.478
- I knew Luann the most
and Kenya the most.

15:14.522 --> 15:16.480
- And I pretty much know
everyone here, but I would love

15:16.524 --> 15:19.570
to get to know everybody deeper
and build a friendship.

15:19.614 --> 15:24.140
- Cynthia I know really well,
and Ramona, girlfriend.

15:24.184 --> 15:25.968
She takes getting used to.

15:26.012 --> 15:27.056
- Yes.
- But to know her--

15:27.100 --> 15:28.144
- She's high maintenance.
- Right.

15:28.188 --> 15:29.624
- To know her is to love her.

15:29.667 --> 15:31.104
- I don't know anything
about Kenya,

15:31.147 --> 15:33.149
except for what
I kind of Googled, so--

15:33.193 --> 15:35.847
- She Googled her.
- I Googled.

15:35.891 --> 15:37.545
'Cause that's who I am.
I like to research things.

15:37.588 --> 15:39.590
- No, but you get a
preconceived notion of people.

15:39.634 --> 15:41.984
- Right.
I'm not into Googling people.

15:42.028 --> 15:43.986
I have a great story for that.

15:44.030 --> 15:45.814
So I was in Miami,

15:45.857 --> 15:48.948
and two separate girls
were like, "Luann,

15:48.991 --> 15:50.862
"you have to meet this guy.

15:50.906 --> 15:51.994
"He's perfect for you.

15:52.038 --> 15:53.822
He's older.
He just got divorced."

15:53.865 --> 15:56.172
And so I was like,
"Wow, I'm so excited."

15:56.216 --> 15:58.566
I get a call from him.
I miss the call.

15:58.609 --> 16:00.872
And in the interim,
he Googled me.

16:00.916 --> 16:02.004
- Aww.

16:02.048 --> 16:04.398
- And he saw that
I had been arrested.

16:04.441 --> 16:07.531
- You're going to jail.
- No, don't touch me.

16:07.575 --> 16:09.055
I'm gonna kill you.
He never called me.

16:09.098 --> 16:10.839
- It scared him off.
- Aww.

16:10.882 --> 16:13.320
- I stayed home that night,
and I was just in tears,

16:13.363 --> 16:15.017
like, the whole night.
I was so heartbroken.

16:15.061 --> 16:16.192
- Because you were hopeful.

16:16.236 --> 16:17.541
- You're going
to get it, Luann.

16:17.585 --> 16:19.021
- You're so beautiful
and so smart...

16:19.065 --> 16:20.370
- Yeah.
- And so elegant.

16:20.414 --> 16:22.024
You're gonna find
the right person.

16:22.068 --> 16:23.417
- It'll be the right guy.
- Yeah.

16:23.460 --> 16:24.896
<i>I think it's very difficult</i>

16:24.940 --> 16:26.724
<i>to maintain a relationship
in a normal life,</i>

16:26.768 --> 16:29.075
<i>never mind being
on a reality TV show,</i>

16:29.118 --> 16:30.859
being such a public person.

16:30.902 --> 16:33.035
<i>It's very scary for men.</i>

16:33.079 --> 16:34.645
Sorry, I'm having, like, a day.

16:34.689 --> 16:37.735
- I know, it's okay!
It's okay. I get that.

16:37.779 --> 16:39.259
We've known each other
for years, at this point.

16:39.302 --> 16:40.869
- She was at my wedding to Tom.

16:40.912 --> 16:42.088
- Yeah, it's a whole thing.

16:42.131 --> 16:43.393
- So what happened with that,
Luann?

16:43.437 --> 16:44.960
Because I don't want
to go by what--

16:45.004 --> 16:47.484
- Oh, my God.
- I'll be back.

16:47.528 --> 16:49.138
- Ramona, where are you going?

16:49.182 --> 16:50.487
- I'll be back.
- All right.

16:50.531 --> 16:52.837
- Ramona, we want
a fellowship with you, like--

16:52.881 --> 16:54.926
- I'm going downstairs.

16:54.970 --> 16:56.580
- You're going downstairs?

16:56.624 --> 16:58.060
- She's sharing.
Why are you going downstairs?

16:58.104 --> 16:59.888
- Yeah, come back, Ramona.
- 'Cause I know the story.

16:59.931 --> 17:01.890
- Well, that's okay.
She's still sharing.

17:01.933 --> 17:04.458
- I'm gonna go down.
I'll come back up.

17:19.647 --> 17:20.996
- Why are you going downstairs?
- Yeah, come back, Ramona.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.171
- 'Cause I know the story.

17:22.215 --> 17:23.955
- But that's okay.
She's still sharing.

17:23.999 --> 17:26.567
- I'm gonna go down.
I'll come back up.

17:28.351 --> 17:29.613
<i>- Luann's too nice.</i>

17:29.657 --> 17:31.702
Like, she puts up
with a lot that Ramona does.

17:31.746 --> 17:33.530
<i>Like, all right,
I get you've heard it already,</i>

17:33.574 --> 17:35.271
but don't be rude.
Like, I don't know.

17:35.315 --> 17:37.012
I just would never
act that way.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.709
- I want to hear Luann's story.

17:38.753 --> 17:39.754
- I want to hear
Luann's story, too.

17:39.797 --> 17:41.364
- Were you madly in love
with him?

17:41.408 --> 17:43.105
- I was madly in love with Tom.

17:43.149 --> 17:44.585
Everybody told me
not to marry him.

17:44.628 --> 17:46.761
- Wait, is that the one
that Bethenny said she saw?

17:46.804 --> 17:47.718
- Yes.

17:47.762 --> 17:49.416
- I have to tell you something.

17:49.459 --> 17:50.460
- Please don't let it
be about Tom.

17:50.504 --> 17:51.722
- It's about Tom,

17:51.766 --> 17:53.115
and I'm gonna
show you some pictures.

17:53.159 --> 17:55.552
- Don't do this to me.

17:55.596 --> 17:57.380
He cheated on me
when we were engaged,

17:57.424 --> 17:58.729
and I still married him.

17:58.773 --> 18:00.035
- Oh, my God.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.124
- He just didn't know
how to be a husband.

18:02.168 --> 18:03.473
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes.

18:03.517 --> 18:05.301
- I really kind of married
my drinking buddy.

18:05.345 --> 18:06.433
- Oh.
- I hate to say it.

18:06.476 --> 18:08.478
- You drank a lot?
- We had--yeah.

18:08.522 --> 18:10.001
I was with him
for, like, a year,

18:10.045 --> 18:12.003
and I really loved him,
and I thought, "You know what?

18:12.047 --> 18:13.396
He needs a woman like me."

18:13.440 --> 18:14.571
We always think--
- Oh.

18:14.615 --> 18:16.051
- You thought
you could change him.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.400
- That we can change him.
- You and I are a lot alike.

18:17.444 --> 18:18.662
- "You're the one."

18:18.706 --> 18:20.142
<i>- I can relate to Luann.</i>

18:20.186 --> 18:22.579
<i>Sometimes, we are so in love
with someone,</i>

18:22.623 --> 18:25.582
we feel like we can
somehow love the bad away,

18:25.626 --> 18:27.497
and it just doesn't
work like that.

18:27.541 --> 18:28.759
- I'm gonna take this up.
- Let's go.

18:28.803 --> 18:30.326
- Are you sure you're
not gonna drop that?

18:30.370 --> 18:32.111
- No, I'm fine.
- Are you sure--ooh.

18:32.154 --> 18:33.373
- I do that every day.

18:33.416 --> 18:34.939
- Oh, here she comes.
Here she comes.

18:34.983 --> 18:36.680
- So I have a gift
for everyone.

18:36.724 --> 18:37.942
- Oh.

18:41.946 --> 18:45.515
- I want a gift of, like, being
sincere and genuine.

18:45.559 --> 18:46.995
- I will give it to you,
at some point.

18:48.039 --> 18:49.650
- What?
You don't like lip glosses?

18:49.693 --> 18:51.260
Everyone likes lip glosses.
- We're talking about Luann.

18:51.304 --> 18:52.870
We're not talking
about lip glosses.

18:52.914 --> 18:55.046
- Fine.
You have your point of view.

18:55.090 --> 18:56.918
I was married for 22 years.

18:56.961 --> 18:58.833
You don't see me
crying over stuff,

18:58.876 --> 19:00.661
<i>and she was married to Tom
for, like, less than a year,</i>

19:00.704 --> 19:02.271
<i>and she knew
he was a [bleep]-up.</i>

19:02.315 --> 19:04.099
Sorry, Luann, but not sorry.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.667
- Well, listen to me.
She just complimented you.

19:06.710 --> 19:09.104
She said how amazing you are,
and then she's crying,

19:09.148 --> 19:11.628
so maybe you should sit
and listen to her story.

19:11.672 --> 19:13.500
- Okay, the whole thing
about Tom D'Agostino

19:13.543 --> 19:14.762
would kind of,
like, push his buttons,

19:14.805 --> 19:16.416
'cause it was in the press
that I dated him,

19:16.459 --> 19:18.331
and I really didn't date him,
and that's what that's about.

19:18.374 --> 19:19.593
- Oh, so that was
a trigger for you?

19:19.636 --> 19:20.637
- Yeah, it was a trigger.

19:20.681 --> 19:22.117
- Wait, wait, wait.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.032
That was a trigger for you?

19:24.075 --> 19:29.472
- Ramona is acting like
a self-centered little monster.

19:29.516 --> 19:31.866
<i>I think she thinks she's on
this vacation by herself,</i>

19:31.909 --> 19:33.824
and maybe she will be
pretty soon.

19:33.868 --> 19:38.655
- Ramona, the level
of your selfishness right now,

19:38.699 --> 19:40.135
it's just beyond.
- Honestly, it is.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.310
- I was married to Tom.

19:41.354 --> 19:42.311
- I know you were married
to Tom.

19:42.355 --> 19:43.486
- Okay, he broke
my heart.

19:43.530 --> 19:44.922
- I know he did.
- Okay, and now you're

19:44.966 --> 19:46.272
gonna make it about you?
- I didn't make it about me.

19:46.315 --> 19:47.664
- You did.
You made it about you.

19:47.708 --> 19:48.665
- I just left to get
a goddamn drink...

19:48.709 --> 19:49.840
- Okay, okay, okay.

19:49.884 --> 19:51.146
- And to get her a drink,
and now you're

19:51.190 --> 19:52.887
turning it around
and making this a big thing,

19:52.930 --> 19:55.281
and I'm so sorry you feel all
this way, but you know what?

19:55.324 --> 19:57.239
I don't care.

19:57.283 --> 19:59.241
- I just think it came off
wrong, you getting up--

19:59.285 --> 20:00.851
- So we have to be together
24/7 all the time talking?

20:00.895 --> 20:02.026
- Well, maybe there's a time...

20:02.070 --> 20:03.550
- I can't get up to go
to the bathroom,

20:03.593 --> 20:05.508
go get a drink.
- Oh, my God, Ramona.

20:05.552 --> 20:07.902
- Here's the problem.

20:07.945 --> 20:09.686
Ramona, you're not even hearing
what we're saying.

20:09.730 --> 20:11.253
- No, you're saying I got up
at an inopportune time.

20:11.297 --> 20:13.342
- You just said you got up
because it was about you.

20:13.386 --> 20:16.040
- She was triggered
by my divorce.

20:16.084 --> 20:17.825
I call out bull

20:17.868 --> 20:19.130
- Excuse me,
this isn't about me,

20:19.174 --> 20:20.219
so I'm just gonna leave.

20:20.262 --> 20:21.655
Excuse me. Sorry.

20:21.698 --> 20:23.483
- There's not enough lip gloss
in the world

20:23.526 --> 20:24.571
to cover up her rudeness.

20:24.614 --> 20:26.181
Girls, don't move, okay?

20:26.225 --> 20:28.531
She's missing the empathy,
and she's missing the timing.

20:28.575 --> 20:30.533
I can't.
- I can't either.

20:30.577 --> 20:33.232
You just took up for her,

20:33.275 --> 20:36.060
made her seem like
she wasn't a horrible person.

20:36.104 --> 20:37.540
- I know. I tried.

20:37.584 --> 20:40.413
- Then she shows herself
to be a horrible person.

20:41.979 --> 20:45.418
I can't do it.

20:45.461 --> 20:47.724
- Can I just have a second?
- Hey, sure.

20:47.768 --> 20:50.901
- I'm okay, but she's
such a asshole.

20:50.945 --> 20:53.687
- I hope you think of it
as constructive criticism.

20:53.730 --> 20:55.254
- No, I'm listening
to what you're saying.

20:55.297 --> 20:57.256
You know, I think maybe
I have a little bit of ADD.

20:57.299 --> 20:58.344
I just can't, like, you know--

20:58.387 --> 20:59.910
- I mean I have it, too,

20:59.954 --> 21:01.956
but, I mean
I try to do the right thing.

21:01.999 --> 21:03.262
- Like, right now,
I want to get up again.

21:03.305 --> 21:04.915
But I'm just gonna stay here.
- I get it.

21:04.959 --> 21:07.788
You definitely are, like,
all over the place, so...

21:10.356 --> 21:11.444
- Well, now I think is

21:11.487 --> 21:12.662
the appropriate time
to disperse,

21:12.706 --> 21:14.185
and I'm gonna go lay
in the sun.

21:16.405 --> 21:18.407
- We're gonna lay out now.
That's the end of that.

21:18.451 --> 21:20.931
- We have
this beautiful blue water.

21:20.975 --> 21:23.369
- Take it off.
-

21:23.412 --> 21:25.458
- Look at this ass!

21:25.501 --> 21:28.461
<i>- I cannot talk about
the Ramona situation anymore.</i>

21:28.504 --> 21:29.897
I just want to have fun.

21:29.940 --> 21:32.291
- Oh, my God.
- I'm just gonna molest her.

21:32.334 --> 21:33.988
- It's a Gorga sandwich.

21:34.031 --> 21:36.120
- Yeah. I'm gonna go swimming.
Who's coming?

21:36.164 --> 21:39.341
- I potentially will
if I'm not too scared.

21:39.385 --> 21:40.864
Oh, my God.

21:40.908 --> 21:43.519
You guys, if you see
any kind of creature, please--

21:43.563 --> 21:44.607
shut up, Kenya!

21:44.651 --> 21:46.435
- What's that?

21:46.479 --> 21:47.654
- Are you kidding me?

21:47.697 --> 21:49.003
- Is that dangerous?

21:50.526 --> 21:52.311
- Can someone look out
for the stingray?

21:52.354 --> 21:53.399
- Let me see.

21:53.442 --> 21:54.835
- Can you see it?

21:54.878 --> 21:55.923
- What does a stingray
look like?

21:55.966 --> 21:57.838
<i>- I've got Ramona on the boat,</i>

21:57.881 --> 22:00.144
a stingray in the water,
I mean--

22:00.188 --> 22:01.798
- No, I just see sand.

22:01.842 --> 22:02.886
- I'll take the stingray.

22:02.930 --> 22:04.758
Esther Williams, watch out.

22:04.801 --> 22:06.803
- Oh, my God, a stingray!
- Shut the up!

22:06.847 --> 22:08.762
- I'm teasing. I'm teasing.
- I hate you!

22:08.805 --> 22:11.591
- Teasing, teasing.
Joke, joke, joke.

22:13.157 --> 22:14.289
- Where's Melissa?

22:14.333 --> 22:15.725
Melissa's not available
to take a photo?

22:16.509 --> 22:17.814
- No, I'm just saying.

22:17.858 --> 22:19.947
You know, she's so gorgeous
and everything.

22:19.990 --> 22:22.079
Wait, come on--wait a minute.
Are we modeling?

22:22.123 --> 22:23.472
Okay!

22:23.516 --> 22:25.344
- Ready?
- Come on, Luann!

22:25.387 --> 22:26.997
- Here I go.

22:27.041 --> 22:29.913
- Oh my God. Oh, my God.
- Oh, this booty.

22:29.957 --> 22:31.350
- What is this?
- Oh, yeah.

22:31.393 --> 22:32.873
Melissa has an ass fetish.

22:32.916 --> 22:34.657
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

22:34.701 --> 22:37.268
- Ahh!
- Okay, get a room!

22:37.312 --> 22:39.140
Honey, at this point,
it looks like

22:39.183 --> 22:41.098
I'd better start getting close
to these new friends,

22:41.142 --> 22:42.230
because my old one--

22:42.273 --> 22:44.841
- Damn.
That is like unedited magic.

22:44.885 --> 22:49.150
- Seems like she's busy
making new friends as well.

22:49.193 --> 22:51.500
<i>- ♪ I thought
this was endless ♪</i>

22:51.544 --> 22:53.633
- Look at Kyle.

22:53.676 --> 22:55.852
<i>- ♪ And I can't seem
to get out what I gave in ♪</i>

22:55.896 --> 22:57.201
<i>♪ My love stretch for miles</i>

22:57.245 --> 22:58.507
<i>♪ And it seems
like it's endless ♪</i>

22:58.551 --> 22:59.769
- Can I speak with you please?

22:59.813 --> 23:01.292
- Me?
- Yes.

23:01.336 --> 23:04.383
- Oh, for sure. Ah!

23:04.426 --> 23:07.168
- I know you've been
with your husband for 25 years.

23:07.211 --> 23:08.865
I've been married
for six months.

23:08.909 --> 23:10.258
This is my second marriage.

23:10.301 --> 23:12.260
I would really like
for it to work.

23:12.303 --> 23:15.089
I don't want to be one
of those people who are married

23:15.132 --> 23:17.526
just to be married,
and I can't stand my husband.

23:17.570 --> 23:19.223
You know,
he's not my best friend.

23:19.267 --> 23:20.877
- So much of that.
- I feel like it's settling.

23:20.921 --> 23:22.401
- Yeah.
- With the world now,

23:22.444 --> 23:24.664
it's so different,
especially with Instagram.

23:24.707 --> 23:26.883
You got hos sliding
in people's--you know.

23:26.927 --> 23:28.145
- Oh, my God.
Are you kidding me?

23:28.189 --> 23:30.191
- These women are sliding
in my man's DMs

23:30.234 --> 23:31.714
every five seconds,
and it's like...

23:31.758 --> 23:33.455
- Oh, yeah, I know.
- Young, hot girls.

23:33.499 --> 23:35.239
- Gonna say the same thing,
and you know, it's so funny,

23:35.283 --> 23:38.895
because my husband doesn't
know how to work Instagram,

23:38.939 --> 23:40.680
so he didn't even know
that existed.

23:40.723 --> 23:41.942
So he was like,
"Can you post this?

23:41.985 --> 23:43.291
I don't know how to do it."
- Right.

23:43.334 --> 23:44.771
- And I look at the DMs
and I'm like,

23:44.814 --> 23:47.034
"Are you kidding me?"

23:47.077 --> 23:48.470
-
You looked at his DMs?

23:48.514 --> 23:51.081
- And don't think it doesn't
mess with my head.

23:51.125 --> 23:52.561
And meanwhile,
I'm getting mad at him,

23:52.605 --> 23:53.606
and he doesn't
know they're there.

23:53.649 --> 23:55.216
- Yeah.

23:55.259 --> 23:56.696
- And it's like,
I get so protective because

23:56.739 --> 23:58.219
I love him so much,

23:58.262 --> 23:59.568
and I'm like, I never knew
I could have

23:59.612 --> 24:00.830
a relationship like this.

24:00.874 --> 24:03.006
My parents were divorced.
- It's amazing.

24:03.050 --> 24:05.008
- It's the most important thing
in the world to me.

24:05.052 --> 24:06.532
- You guys seem
really compatible.

24:06.575 --> 24:08.490
I know, like, communication
is really important,

24:08.534 --> 24:10.405
and that's something
that Mike and I are working on.

24:10.449 --> 24:13.539
We don't have the best
communication skills.

24:13.582 --> 24:14.931
Tone is something
I have to work on

24:14.975 --> 24:16.672
when I get irritated
and frustrated.

24:16.716 --> 24:18.108
- Me too.
- Really? Oh, my God.

24:18.152 --> 24:20.067
- Oh, yeah, 100%.
You have to remember, like,

24:20.110 --> 24:22.199
I sit there and I think,
"Okay, this is annoying me.

24:22.243 --> 24:23.592
Ugh, I want to strangle him
right now."

24:23.636 --> 24:24.941
- Right.

24:24.985 --> 24:26.900
- But would I want
anyone else's husband?

24:26.943 --> 24:28.771
- No.
- Hell no.

24:28.815 --> 24:31.295
The best advice
I could give is,

24:31.339 --> 24:32.819
it's really important
to surround yourself

24:32.862 --> 24:34.473
with other
happily-married couples,

24:34.516 --> 24:35.996
because you know how you have
that one guy

24:36.039 --> 24:37.650
that's not happy,
cheats on the wife.

24:37.693 --> 24:39.347
You don't want that person
hanging out with your husband.

24:39.390 --> 24:40.653
- No.
- Right?

24:40.696 --> 24:42.089
- No.
- And there's gonna be things

24:42.132 --> 24:44.439
that are annoying
and things we don't love.

24:44.483 --> 24:47.311
But our common goal is,
we want to grow old together.

24:47.355 --> 24:49.400
The fact that you care so much
sounds like

24:49.444 --> 24:51.098
you're putting your whole heart
and soul into this.

24:51.141 --> 24:52.534
- Yes.
- And he has to feel that, too.

24:52.578 --> 24:53.622
- Yeah, and he does. He does.

24:53.666 --> 24:54.971
And I can't wait
for you to meet him.

24:55.015 --> 24:56.843
I want the opportunity
to get to know you better

24:56.886 --> 24:58.105
and definitely hang out
with your man, too.

24:58.148 --> 25:00.673
- Aww, I'm so happy.
Mwah.

25:00.716 --> 25:02.501
- I'm excited to get to know
Kyle better.

25:02.544 --> 25:06.026
<i>She is just being
so open and transparent.</i>

25:06.069 --> 25:07.070
Like, I really dig her.

25:07.114 --> 25:08.811
- To love.
- Yes, to love.

25:08.855 --> 25:10.639
<i>- I think today is
the beginning</i>

25:10.683 --> 25:13.033
of a beautiful friendship.

25:13.076 --> 25:15.078
- Honestly, like,
I see--there's a bee.

25:15.122 --> 25:17.298
- Ahh!
- Oh, my God!

25:17.341 --> 25:19.039
- See, that's like the girls
coming in the DMs!

25:19.082 --> 25:20.649
you, asshole!

25:22.259 --> 25:25.306

26:03.431 --> 26:06.260
oh, God, I don't know

26:06.303 --> 26:08.915

by mistake on my Insta story.

26:08.958 --> 26:12.135

her whole bank account!

26:12.179 --> 26:14.311
<i>I was dying. I saw that.</i>

26:14.355 --> 26:16.575
- Oh, my God.
I'm gonna post something

26:16.618 --> 26:18.402
so I can get people thinking
about something else.

26:18.446 --> 26:22.102
- Oh, my God.
That's hysterical.

26:25.453 --> 26:26.976
- Okay, fun shade.

26:27.020 --> 26:29.196
My favorite kind of shade.

26:29.239 --> 26:30.850
"Shade at your own risk."

26:30.893 --> 26:33.853
Oh, boy, better hope
it's more fun shade.

26:33.896 --> 26:35.942
Don't shade below the belt.

26:35.985 --> 26:37.683
- Whoo-hoo!

26:37.726 --> 26:39.946
- Can you stop being Beyoncé
for a moment and tie this?

26:39.989 --> 26:41.904
- No, I gotta keep
being Beyoncé.

26:41.948 --> 26:44.385
- You have been drunk
for hours.

26:44.428 --> 26:46.692
- Ramona,
do not create drama tonight.

26:46.735 --> 26:48.519
Do not create drama tonight.

26:48.563 --> 26:51.174
Do not create drama.
Go with the flow.

26:51.218 --> 26:53.655
Be a team player.
Don't upset anybody.

26:53.699 --> 26:56.832
You like all these girls.
You want them to like you.

26:56.876 --> 26:58.181
You have good eyes.

26:58.225 --> 26:59.661
Create the drama
with your eyes.

26:59.705 --> 27:01.358
Keep your mouth freaking shut.

27:01.402 --> 27:04.013
- Okay, so we have
Lu's Lightning,

27:04.057 --> 27:07.147
non-alcoholic,
the Shady Champagne,

27:07.190 --> 27:09.802
the Messy Margarita,
and the Vicious Vodka.

27:09.845 --> 27:12.369
- Hi!
Oh, it smells so good.

27:12.413 --> 27:16.330
- Cynthia, I made this for you.
- Oh, my God!

27:16.373 --> 27:17.723
It's lit.

27:17.766 --> 27:19.246
I love it.
Thank you so much.

27:19.289 --> 27:22.989
I've hosted maybe three
Bailey Qs in Atlanta.

27:23.032 --> 27:24.207
<i>Who do you guys think,
in the group...</i>

27:24.251 --> 27:25.687
- Shamea.
- Is the best twerker?

27:25.731 --> 27:27.341
- Come on, back!
- Okay.

27:27.384 --> 27:28.603
- Hey, hey, hey!

27:28.647 --> 27:31.258
- And now we have taken it
to the islands.

27:31.301 --> 27:33.390
These are good.
Did you put some sugar?

27:33.434 --> 27:35.958
- Mm-hmm.
- You're the bomb.

27:36.002 --> 27:37.612
I'm gonna put a few
more pickles in here.

27:37.656 --> 27:40.397
My cast members in Atlanta
call the Bailey Q the Shady Q,

27:40.441 --> 27:41.572
'cause it can get
a little shady.

27:41.616 --> 27:44.314
The next award
is the thirstiest person.

27:44.358 --> 27:46.708
- I nominate Marlo.
- Me?

27:46.752 --> 27:48.362
- Who's the freakiest?

27:48.405 --> 27:51.060
She's freaky and try
to keep it a secret.

27:51.104 --> 27:53.106
- The only one--
I don't do backdoor.

27:53.149 --> 27:55.238
- You mean
you don't do it anymore.

27:55.282 --> 27:57.240
Oh!

27:57.284 --> 27:58.720
<i>- This is like an icebreaker.</i>

27:58.764 --> 28:00.330
<i>We're getting to know
each other,</i>

28:00.374 --> 28:01.897
and not just
on a surface level.

28:01.941 --> 28:04.857
Like, really going in there
and digging a little deeper.

28:04.900 --> 28:08.077
<i>♪</i>

28:08.121 --> 28:09.644
- How you doing?

28:09.688 --> 28:11.080
- Can I come in?

28:11.124 --> 28:12.255
Look at you.

28:14.301 --> 28:16.433
- I don't even know
what it means.

28:16.477 --> 28:19.001
- I'm doing the Bailey Q,
but you need a red outfit.

28:19.045 --> 28:20.829
You gotta come ready
to read or get read.

28:20.873 --> 28:22.744
- Basically,
it's telling someone off

28:22.788 --> 28:25.181
in a really, like, clever way,
so you either...

28:25.225 --> 28:26.922
Wear red.
- Or you're gonna...

28:26.966 --> 28:28.619
Get read.
- Right.

28:28.663 --> 28:31.927
- Oh, there she is!
Read or get read.

28:31.971 --> 28:34.060
Oh, my God, you look gorgeous.

28:34.103 --> 28:36.410
- Thank you.
- I'm ready to get read.

28:36.453 --> 28:38.934
- Let's open up.
- Whoo!

28:38.978 --> 28:40.544
- Oh, my God, glorious.

28:40.588 --> 28:41.763
Can we have three

28:41.807 --> 28:43.417
of the fabulous margaritas
again for us?

28:43.460 --> 28:45.288
- I'm gonna have a glass
of Camus please.

28:45.332 --> 28:46.376
- She's going
the elegant route.

28:46.420 --> 28:48.030
I'm going the party route.

28:48.074 --> 28:49.771
Where are all the other ladies?
We're always the first ones.

28:49.815 --> 28:51.468
- I know. I'm always on time.
- Who knew?

28:51.512 --> 28:53.775
Beverly Hills, low maintenance.
Shocker.

28:53.819 --> 28:55.211
- We're all in red,

28:55.255 --> 28:56.778
so does that mean
nobody's getting read?

28:56.822 --> 28:58.345
- Well, someone may get read.

28:58.388 --> 29:00.477
- Oh, my God.
- I don't want to be shady.

29:00.521 --> 29:02.175
I have to be
drama-free tonight,

29:02.218 --> 29:03.872
and if she asks me
a shady question,

29:03.916 --> 29:05.439
I'm just gonna say, "I pass."

29:05.482 --> 29:07.267
- This is actually your day
you're allowed to be shady.

29:07.310 --> 29:08.442
- Don't hold back tonight.

29:08.485 --> 29:09.922
Tonight is not the night
to hold back.

29:09.965 --> 29:11.750
<i>- I don't believe them,
'cause I'll say something,</i>

29:11.793 --> 29:13.839

so I'm zipping it tonight.

29:13.882 --> 29:15.928

Hi. How are you?

29:15.971 --> 29:17.277
- Oh, you look beautiful.

29:17.320 --> 29:18.669
- We have every different
shade of red

29:18.713 --> 29:19.975
under the sun at this point.
- I love it though.

29:20.019 --> 29:21.803
It's perfect.
- Wow!

29:21.847 --> 29:24.675
- Hi.
- So pretty.

29:24.719 --> 29:27.983
- Aww, you girls look gorgeous.
- Who are we missing now?

29:28.810 --> 29:30.769
- Do I have a highlight
down on here?

29:30.812 --> 29:32.422
- Yes.
- Has anyone spoken to Kenya?

29:32.466 --> 29:33.815
- No, where is she?
- I went to check on her.

29:33.859 --> 29:34.990
And she was still doing
her hair and makeup.

29:35.034 --> 29:36.209
- Hair and makeup, all right.

29:36.252 --> 29:37.427
- Does she have a person
helping her?

29:37.471 --> 29:38.951
- Two.
- Two people helping her?

29:38.994 --> 29:42.563
- I did my own hair and makeup.
It's like, you know...

29:42.606 --> 29:45.000
- Okay, so we're going to go
ahead and get started.

29:45.044 --> 29:46.262
First of all, welcome,
you guys,

29:46.306 --> 29:48.177
to my third annual Bailey Q.

29:48.221 --> 29:50.005
Kenya's played the game before.
- Oh, okay.

29:50.049 --> 29:51.398
- So we won't start
without her,

29:51.441 --> 29:54.053
but I will at least start
to explain the rules.

29:54.096 --> 29:55.141
She's played it, like,
a million times.

29:55.184 --> 29:56.446
- Yeah, yeah, it's all good.

29:56.490 --> 29:58.274
<i>If I showed up, like,
an hour late,</i>

29:58.318 --> 30:00.146
I'd be dead meat so quickly.

30:00.189 --> 30:04.672
- In this very unattractive
envelope are some shady awards.

30:04.715 --> 30:07.849
For each award, we decide
as a group who gets the award.

30:07.893 --> 30:09.024
- Okay.
- All right.

30:09.068 --> 30:11.853
For example,
this is the sexiest award.

30:11.897 --> 30:13.159
- The sexiest. Okay.

30:13.202 --> 30:16.858
- So we have to decide
who is the sexiest.

30:16.902 --> 30:18.817
- Okay.

30:18.860 --> 30:22.690
But to me, sexy isn't about
who has the best body.

30:22.733 --> 30:24.735
- Well, it depends
on who you're asking.

30:24.779 --> 30:26.259
'Cause we all have
different definitions

30:26.302 --> 30:27.651
of what we consider sexy.

30:27.695 --> 30:29.131
- It would be really hard
to pick in this group,

30:29.175 --> 30:30.567
'cause everyone is a very sexy
person depending on--

30:30.611 --> 30:32.743
- That's only one subject.
There's 17 more.

30:32.787 --> 30:34.920
- I know, but I'm just
already thinking about that.

30:34.963 --> 30:36.269
- We're all sexy.
There we go.

30:36.312 --> 30:37.966
All right, next.
We're all sexy.

30:38.010 --> 30:42.579
- The next one is the smartest.
This is the pettiest award.

30:42.623 --> 30:45.321
- It's getting shady now.
- Who is the prettiest?

30:45.365 --> 30:47.019
- Oh, this feels weird.

30:47.062 --> 30:49.412
- You can say, "You know what?
I pick Cynthia because"...

30:49.456 --> 30:50.544
- I could never
say that though.

30:50.587 --> 30:51.893
- "Not only is she beautiful

30:51.937 --> 30:53.634
on the outside,
she's beautiful on the inside."

30:53.677 --> 30:55.157
- I don't know.

30:55.201 --> 30:57.594
It's 2021.

30:57.638 --> 30:59.901
- Who has the best butt?
And we've seen a lot of asses.

30:59.945 --> 31:01.076
- Yeah.

31:01.120 --> 31:02.469
<i>- We're going to vote</i>

31:02.512 --> 31:04.253
<i>who the prettiest woman
at the table is?</i>

31:04.297 --> 31:05.602
I'm not comfortable with that.

31:05.646 --> 31:07.604
- We need Kenya, no, for this?
- Yeah.

31:07.648 --> 31:08.910
- We can't start it
without her.

31:08.954 --> 31:10.477
- But can we eat though?
'Cause I'm kinda hungry.

31:10.520 --> 31:12.044
- Can somebody check on her?

31:12.087 --> 31:14.873
- Kenya's having her hair and
makeup done by three people.

31:14.916 --> 31:16.265
- Speaking of appetizers.

31:16.309 --> 31:18.354
- I don't know, whatever.
You're the host.

31:18.398 --> 31:20.922
- Oh, my God.
It smells so good in here.

31:20.966 --> 31:23.185
Can I have a little burger?
I just want to grab something.

31:23.229 --> 31:24.317
I'm starving.

31:24.360 --> 31:25.796
- I feel weird

31:25.840 --> 31:27.624
about saying who's
the prettiest or whatever.

31:27.668 --> 31:29.365
Like, that's like saying,
"Who's your favorite child?"

31:29.409 --> 31:30.671
Like, I have all favorites.
- Oh, there she is!

31:30.714 --> 31:31.933
- But I'm gonna figure it out
as we go along

31:31.977 --> 31:33.282
'cause it's tricky.

31:33.326 --> 31:36.590
- Wait, what's going on?
- Oh, hi, gorgeous woman.

31:36.633 --> 31:38.984
No, we're talking
about the questions,

31:39.027 --> 31:41.421
and I'm not that comfortable
with the questions.

31:41.464 --> 31:42.639
Like, who is the prettiest?

31:42.683 --> 31:44.337
Like, everyone here
is gorgeous.

31:44.380 --> 31:46.339
- It's like...

31:46.382 --> 31:47.731
<i>- Kenya's played this game
before.</i>

31:47.775 --> 31:50.909
She knows
that it's never my intention

31:50.952 --> 31:53.389
to make anyone uncomfortable,

31:53.433 --> 31:55.826
<i>so for Kenya to jump
on Kyle's bandwagon</i>

31:55.870 --> 31:58.307
<i>instead of saying,
"You're in a safe space,"</i>

31:58.351 --> 31:59.874
it's like a slap in the face.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.876
- What have you got there?
- Where did you get that from?

32:03.443 --> 32:05.314
I stole it from the table.
I'm so hungry.

32:05.358 --> 32:06.620
- I'm hungry, too.

32:06.663 --> 32:08.100
<i>- And then my friend,</i>

32:08.143 --> 32:10.885
<i>the one friend I knew I had
coming on this trip,</i>

32:10.929 --> 32:12.582
twirls on in,

32:12.626 --> 32:15.716
helps herself to some macaroni
and cheese, no apologies.

32:15.759 --> 32:19.807
<i>Like we haven't sat here
and waited a whole hour.</i>

32:19.850 --> 32:21.330
Thanks, friend.

32:21.374 --> 32:22.766
Okay, well,
they're putting out the food,

32:22.810 --> 32:24.333
and Kenya's already
started eating.

32:24.377 --> 32:26.379
- Yes, I have low blood sugar.

32:33.690 --> 32:35.605
<i>- The food's just being served
at the buffet now.</i>

32:35.649 --> 32:36.998
- Kenya's already started
eating, so...

32:37.042 --> 32:38.652
- Yeah, so let's eat.
- Can we just make a plate?

32:38.695 --> 32:40.045
- Let's make a plate,
and then we can play.

32:40.088 --> 32:41.655
- Then we'll start the games?
- Yeah, sounds good.

32:41.698 --> 32:43.570
<i>- I can tell Cynthia's
really annoyed by the fact</i>

32:43.613 --> 32:45.050
<i>that Kenya was late.</i>

32:45.093 --> 32:46.790
It was her night.
That's her good girlfriend.

32:46.834 --> 32:48.531
<i>But I don't think anybody</i>

32:48.575 --> 32:50.011
<i>really wanted
to make a big deal of it.</i>

32:50.055 --> 32:51.621
- Wait, hold on,
I just want to read you

32:51.665 --> 32:52.796
what some of these things say.

32:52.840 --> 32:54.755
This one here is,
who's the smartest?

32:54.798 --> 32:57.627
- Oh.
- That's kind of weird, right?

32:57.671 --> 32:59.978
I don't want to diss her game,
but sexiest.

33:00.021 --> 33:01.805
- It's marginalizing us.
- Best butt.

33:01.849 --> 33:03.155
You know what I mean?
It's weird.

33:03.198 --> 33:05.984
- This is my potato salad.
Hope you guys enjoy.

33:06.027 --> 33:08.464
- Ooh, this is some Southern
nice cooking right here.

33:08.508 --> 33:11.032
- Thank you.
- I'm really liking this.

33:11.076 --> 33:14.340
- Made a nice little barbecue.
- Yes, we got some cornbread.

33:14.383 --> 33:16.472
- Bon appetit.
- Thank you so much.

33:19.084 --> 33:21.129
- Do you want to grab
something to eat, Kyle?

33:21.173 --> 33:22.739
- Okay, yes.

33:29.050 --> 33:31.357
- Goddess, you okay?

33:31.400 --> 33:32.836
- Here's the thing.

33:32.880 --> 33:34.577
You've played
these games before.

33:34.621 --> 33:36.623
You know, it can be
what you want it to be.

33:36.666 --> 33:38.581
My intention is for it
to be fun and for us

33:38.625 --> 33:40.105
to get to know
each other a little better.

33:40.148 --> 33:43.499
- Can we play Taboo?
- Maybe on your night we can.

33:43.543 --> 33:44.935
Then we can play it
on the yacht.

33:44.979 --> 33:48.113
- It's not the nicest game,
but Atlanta,

33:48.156 --> 33:50.158
<i>we throw shade
like it's nothing,</i>

33:50.202 --> 33:51.377
<i>and it's cool.</i>

33:51.420 --> 33:53.118
But here it's just maybe not.

33:54.945 --> 33:56.338
- Taboo, I used to play
that all the time.

33:56.382 --> 33:57.992
- Oh, I love Taboo.

33:58.036 --> 34:01.082
<i>So I think that Cynthia just
needs to give these ladies</i>

34:01.126 --> 34:02.605
a little pass on this one.

34:02.649 --> 34:03.824
- So how do we play?

34:03.867 --> 34:05.826
- Everyone's gonna pick
a question.

34:05.869 --> 34:07.045
- So now, if she picks
the question,

34:07.088 --> 34:08.350
she answers the question?

34:08.394 --> 34:09.482
- Correct.
- Okay.

34:09.525 --> 34:11.092
- Okay, and these
come last or what?

34:11.136 --> 34:12.485
- The awards will be last.

34:12.528 --> 34:14.095
- All right, so let's get
the party started.

34:14.139 --> 34:15.531
- Pass it down to Ramona.

34:15.575 --> 34:16.924
- Okay, Ramona.
- Pick one.

34:16.967 --> 34:18.882
- Uh-oh.
I'm scared of these questions.

34:18.926 --> 34:20.754
- I'm so curious.
I want to know.

34:20.797 --> 34:23.365
- Ugh, I'm changing
for a new question.

34:23.409 --> 34:24.758
- Oh, no.
You're not allowed to--

34:24.801 --> 34:26.629
- Ramona, come on.
- No, no, no, no, no.

34:26.673 --> 34:28.370
Go back and--
- Okay, no, I can't.

34:28.414 --> 34:29.589
- Come on. Like--
- I can't.

34:29.632 --> 34:30.938
- Just--
- Why?

34:30.981 --> 34:33.201
- It's gonna create shade
for me,

34:33.245 --> 34:34.376
and I didn't want the shade.

34:34.420 --> 34:36.422
- I know,
but this is the shady room.

34:36.465 --> 34:37.727
- Please be a team player.

34:37.771 --> 34:39.381
Pick one,
and then whatever you get...

34:39.425 --> 34:40.513
- So you can reflect.
- You have to do.

34:40.556 --> 34:43.820
- Fine.
- Is it the same question?

34:43.864 --> 34:45.431
- No, who has the best butt
in the group?

34:45.474 --> 34:47.737
Actually,
we all have great butts.

34:47.781 --> 34:49.043
- Okay.
Which one is your favorite?

34:49.087 --> 34:50.610
- When we were leaving
the boat,

34:50.653 --> 34:51.959
Teresa, you had that thing on,

34:52.002 --> 34:53.439
and you were
kind of shimmering,

34:53.482 --> 34:54.962
and your butt
was kind of bouncing.

34:55.005 --> 34:56.790
I'm like, "Jesus Christ,
her butt looks good."

34:56.833 --> 34:58.792
- Boom, boom, boom.
- It's like, "Wow."

34:58.835 --> 35:00.315
- So Teresa's was
your favorite butt?

35:00.359 --> 35:04.624
See how easy that was?
And we're all still alive.

35:04.667 --> 35:06.582
<i>The question was not
that complicated.</i>

35:06.626 --> 35:09.107
Have fun with it.
Who's next?

35:09.150 --> 35:12.632
- Who would you sex, marry,
kill in this group?

35:12.675 --> 35:14.895
- All right, who would you
have sex with first?

35:14.938 --> 35:16.418
- Okay, but you have
to think about this.

35:16.462 --> 35:17.593
Like, if you--
- Luann.

35:17.637 --> 35:19.508
- Oh, wow.

35:19.552 --> 35:21.075
- Sex with Luann.
- I love it.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.685
- Well,
because I saw her today,

35:22.729 --> 35:24.296
and she kind of turned me on.

35:24.339 --> 35:26.167
- Yeah.
- Marry?

35:26.211 --> 35:28.778
Let's see, marry.
Cynthia.

35:28.822 --> 35:31.477
She's like--she's very
touchy-feely, and so am I.

35:31.520 --> 35:32.956
- We have the same
love language.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.785
- Yes, and who would I kill,
in this group?

35:35.829 --> 35:39.528
I mean, she did say
something mean about me

35:39.572 --> 35:41.617
without knowing me,

35:41.661 --> 35:43.097
but now you do know me.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.491
So Ramona.
But I wouldn't kill her.

35:45.534 --> 35:47.101
- Come on, it's a game.

35:47.145 --> 35:48.798
She knows
you're not gonna kill her.

35:48.842 --> 35:50.583
- And I accept it.
- Although the night is young.

35:53.673 --> 35:55.718
- Thank you, thank you
for being a team player

35:55.762 --> 35:56.980
and answering the question.

35:57.024 --> 35:59.069
- Cynthia's very upset
right now.

35:59.113 --> 36:01.420
- Upset about what?
- I'm not upset.

36:01.463 --> 36:03.161
Let me just be very clear
about that.

36:03.204 --> 36:04.901
I know, for sure,
that I'm a team player,

36:04.945 --> 36:07.774
so I was a little irritated,
because I was excited

36:07.817 --> 36:10.124
about putting this together
for you guys.

36:10.168 --> 36:11.473
But if you guys
are uncomfortable,

36:11.517 --> 36:12.692
we can have that conversation,

36:12.735 --> 36:15.825
but I would like
that same respect.

36:15.869 --> 36:18.611
- Cynthia's taking this
far too seriously.

36:18.654 --> 36:21.222
Can we have fun and just
do the questions again?

36:21.266 --> 36:24.007
You're the host.
You're not making this fun.

36:24.051 --> 36:28.098
- Let's go. Let's move it.
Who is the most disrespectful?

36:28.142 --> 36:30.536
Well, hands down,
that's Ramona.

36:30.579 --> 36:33.321
- Own it, own it!
- I own it, I own it!

36:33.365 --> 36:34.540
Keep it moving.

36:34.583 --> 36:35.497
This is how you want
the game to go.

36:35.541 --> 36:36.542
- Oh, my God, you're not gonna

36:36.585 --> 36:37.673
believe this question,
you guys.

36:37.717 --> 36:39.022
- Yes! Read it, read it.

36:39.066 --> 36:41.024
- What is your
biggest insecurity?

36:43.592 --> 36:45.115
- Ramona.
- No, my biggest insecurity...

36:45.159 --> 36:46.160
- Oh, the biggest.

36:46.204 --> 36:48.293
- Like, I have
body image issues.

36:48.336 --> 36:50.295
I had an eating disorder
when I was younger.

36:50.338 --> 36:54.037
I don't anymore,
but it never really leaves you.

36:54.081 --> 36:55.604
And then when you're
in the public eye,

36:55.648 --> 36:58.041
I mean, people say things,
and I get more self-conscious,

36:58.085 --> 37:00.305
and I look at people
like Luann move and just,

37:00.348 --> 37:02.959
like, run around and be free,
and I just am not that person.

37:03.003 --> 37:04.831
I don't think
I'll ever be that person.

37:04.874 --> 37:08.661
- I really like this question,
and if you guys are okay,

37:08.704 --> 37:11.098
I would like to actually pass
that question around the table.

37:11.141 --> 37:12.926
- I thought we were trying
to keep this light?

37:12.969 --> 37:15.711
- I kind of fear getting older.

37:15.755 --> 37:17.452
Just, like, things that change
with your body...

37:17.496 --> 37:18.627
- Join the club.
- And everything.

37:18.671 --> 37:20.238
- Join the club.

37:20.281 --> 37:22.240
- Yes, so that does make me
a little insecure.

37:22.283 --> 37:27.723
- My biggest insecurity was--
before Brooklyn,

37:27.767 --> 37:30.987
was never finding
unconditional love.

37:31.031 --> 37:34.556
But now, it is never
finding that in a man.

37:34.600 --> 37:35.949
- Oh.
- Yeah.

37:35.992 --> 37:37.994
- One of my
biggest insecurities

37:38.038 --> 37:39.648
was finding love again.

37:39.692 --> 37:41.650
You know, I have a great life,

37:41.694 --> 37:43.522
and none of it's fun
by yourself.

37:43.565 --> 37:45.001
It's just not, you know?

37:45.045 --> 37:48.918
- I come off as if
I'm confident, I would say,

37:48.962 --> 37:51.573
but the truth is,
I'm very insecure

37:51.617 --> 37:54.489
about leaving my husband alone,

37:54.533 --> 37:58.667
and I've never caught Joe
ever doing anything wrong,

37:58.711 --> 38:00.060
but it's a real...

38:00.103 --> 38:01.583
- Wow.
- Problem for me.

38:01.627 --> 38:05.761
And I think it relates, for me,
back to daddy issues.

38:05.805 --> 38:08.590
I saw my dad cheat
his whole life.

38:08.634 --> 38:10.592
I watched my mother suffer,

38:10.636 --> 38:13.726
and she taught me
not to trust a man.

38:13.769 --> 38:15.336
- Yes.

38:15.380 --> 38:18.818
- And I'm always worried that
my family is going to break,

38:18.861 --> 38:21.124
and I'm envious
when you walk out that door,

38:21.168 --> 38:23.823
and you enjoy your girls' night
without any stress,

38:23.866 --> 38:25.868
'cause I can't do it.

38:25.912 --> 38:28.567
- You're not alone!
- I am crazy!

38:28.610 --> 38:30.438
No, I am a psycho!

38:30.482 --> 38:31.787
- Right.
- Right.

38:31.831 --> 38:33.136
<i>- Ever since
she married my brother,</i>

38:33.180 --> 38:35.225
they were both very jealous
of each other.

38:35.269 --> 38:38.446
They both were not allowed
to go out with their friends.

38:38.490 --> 38:41.057
They were always together,
but you know what?

38:41.101 --> 38:42.668
Every relationship
is different.

38:42.711 --> 38:44.844
I don't like to cast judgment
on anyone.

38:44.887 --> 38:46.019
<i>Whatever works
for your marriage,</i>

38:46.062 --> 38:47.368
that's what you should go with.

38:47.412 --> 38:49.152
- Ramona, what is
your biggest insecurity?

38:49.196 --> 38:50.415
- My body image.

38:50.458 --> 38:51.807
- What?

38:51.851 --> 38:53.331
- My body image.
I don't feel good about it.

38:53.374 --> 38:54.723
- Ramona.

38:54.767 --> 38:56.551
- Didn't she come out
in a G-string and pasties?

38:56.595 --> 38:57.813
- Ramona, I would not say

38:57.857 --> 38:59.162
you're insecure
about your body.

38:59.206 --> 39:01.382
- Is that her asshole?
- Right here. Yeah.

39:01.426 --> 39:02.601
- She's an exhibitionist.

39:02.644 --> 39:04.080
- Sometimes,
when people are insecure,

39:04.124 --> 39:05.778
they put out the opposite.

39:05.821 --> 39:08.302
If that's what you say you're
insecure about, I receive it.

39:08.346 --> 39:09.999
- Luann, what's
your insecurity?

39:10.043 --> 39:11.958
- I'm just terrified I'm gonna
grow old with Ramona,

39:12.001 --> 39:14.395
and I'm gonna have to push her
around Central Park

39:14.439 --> 39:15.744
in a wheelchair!

39:17.616 --> 39:19.269
<i>- In my opinion,
this is amazing.</i>

39:19.313 --> 39:21.184
Like, everybody
started opening up,

39:21.228 --> 39:23.186
which is why I had the Bailey Q
in the first place.

39:23.230 --> 39:26.625
I personally am loving this,
and at the end--

39:26.668 --> 39:30.106
- Me too. I love this.

39:30.150 --> 39:32.674
And I'm really sorry
if I took it too seriously.

39:34.633 --> 39:36.548
- I appreciate that. <i>
- Hmm.</i>

39:36.591 --> 39:40.421
These ladies are finally
getting a glimpse of 50-Cynt.

39:40.465 --> 39:42.467
- I didn't realize
you actually were upset.

39:42.510 --> 39:44.686
Were you upset?
- I was a little irritated.

39:44.730 --> 39:45.992

- Yes.

of kicked it off.

39:48.647 --> 39:49.735
- Yes.

39:49.778 --> 39:53.042
- Beware, and be very afraid.

39:53.086 --> 39:55.871
- You just seemed
very unwilling

39:55.915 --> 39:57.873

40:00.528 --> 40:01.921

just a little bit jealous

that I am connecting
with some of these ladies.

40:27.729 --> 40:29.470

- Do you understand
why I was irritated?

40:32.778 --> 40:35.041
- I do, but do you understand
why I thought it was weird

40:35.084 --> 40:38.653
to do an award
about who looks prettiest?

40:38.697 --> 40:39.915
- I do, but...
- Okay.

40:39.959 --> 40:41.177
- It's a game, and, you know,

40:41.221 --> 40:44.529
we're just having
fun with this.

40:44.572 --> 40:46.356
- Because the thing with me,
with four daughters, it's like,

40:46.400 --> 40:48.837
when I hear
"who has the prettiest this"

40:48.881 --> 40:50.665
or whatever,
I just go to that place,

40:50.709 --> 40:52.319
so I don't mean
to take the fun away from it.

40:52.362 --> 40:53.712
Yeah, let's do it.
Let's do the awards.

40:53.755 --> 40:55.235
I'm not gonna be the person
who says that's not fun.

40:55.278 --> 40:56.845
- No, no, you already said it.

40:56.889 --> 40:58.020
It's fine, and we've had
the conversation.

40:58.064 --> 40:59.718
And it's okay. We can move on.

40:59.761 --> 41:01.067

to be a buzzkill.

- I accept your apology.

41:02.503 --> 41:04.113
Thank you for apologizing.
- Okay.

41:04.157 --> 41:05.463
- Totally fine.

41:05.506 --> 41:08.596
So anyone
that feels comfortable

41:08.640 --> 41:09.728
will give the award.

41:09.771 --> 41:11.077
- So go ahead, Ramona.
You go first.

41:11.120 --> 41:13.514
- Okay, sweetest.

41:13.558 --> 41:15.821

Aww.

41:21.609 --> 41:23.872

take this moment--

41:25.265 --> 41:27.397
I'd like to share this award
with Ms. Cynthia,

41:27.441 --> 41:30.966
because I feel
sweet can be underrated,

41:31.010 --> 41:32.533
but it takes a lot to be sweet,

41:32.577 --> 41:34.927
so I'm wearing this
with pride, Ramona.

41:34.970 --> 41:36.189
- All right.
- I'd like to thank Jesus.

41:36.232 --> 41:37.930
I'd like to thank God.

Okay, the smartest.
Ms. Kenya.

Oh, this is easy.
Kyle!

41:47.983 --> 41:49.594
- Luann.

41:49.637 --> 41:52.248
To be sober in this group
takes a lot of strength.

41:52.292 --> 41:53.641
- Ramona, you have
a great butt.

41:53.685 --> 41:56.252

a fashion icon, baby.

- Yes!
- You are amazing.

42:00.126 --> 42:03.085

- The award is the sexiest.

42:03.129 --> 42:05.044
- So this is very difficult.

42:05.087 --> 42:07.568
- But...

42:07.612 --> 42:09.004
- What are you gonna say?

42:09.048 --> 42:10.745
Who's the sexiest
one here, Kenya?

42:26.587 --> 42:28.807
- Whatever you want.
It's your thing.

42:28.850 --> 42:32.767
- Well, you know, it's not
whatever I want, obviously.

42:32.811 --> 42:36.292
It's whatever we want,
and I'm fine with it.

42:36.336 --> 42:39.600
- Cynthia is so salty
right now,

42:39.644 --> 42:41.776

the "it's fine" bit.

a little shady
