l tell you what, why don't you head
to the kitchen and select a wine?

12:09.666 --> 12:11.410
l wouldn't know what to pick.

12:11.627 --> 12:14.332
Well, all right.
On the counter, you'll find my wine log.

12:14.505 --> 12:18.504
Just select something
from Frasier's Favourites.

12:23.517 --> 12:26.008
All right, Kenny, Janis is in the kitchen.
You're free to go.

12:26.187 --> 12:29.603
Go where? To an empty house?
An all-night movie?

12:29.774 --> 12:31.399
Just walk the streets?

12:31.610 --> 12:33.650
All those sound good.

12:36.074 --> 12:38.862
l can't take it anymore.
l'm gonna call her cell phone.

12:39.036 --> 12:41.788
l'll tell her l love her,
and demand she come home.

12:41.998 --> 12:44.371
lnstead of crying,
it's time l started acting like a man.

12:44.543 --> 12:46.037
- Good for you.
- Can you dial for me?

12:46.211 --> 12:48.003
My hands are sweaty.

13:02.607 --> 13:06.557
Oh. Mm. Oh.

13:10.408 --> 13:11.903
NlLES:
Daphne.

13:13.954 --> 13:16.031
Daphne, l fixed
the exercise machine.

13:16.207 --> 13:19.956
Turns out you didn't bend the frame.
You just popped one of the springs.

13:20.629 --> 13:23.002
- What are you going?
- Dr. Crane insisted

13:23.174 --> 13:25.582
l dust all knick-knacks
before going out.

13:25.802 --> 13:28.258
FRASlER: Hello, Niles.
- Good God, man.

13:28.430 --> 13:29.711
Just because Daphne lives here

13:29.890 --> 13:32.892
doesn't mean she's at your
beck and call 24 hours a day.

13:33.103 --> 13:35.262
As soon as we finish our obliques,
we're out of here,

13:35.439 --> 13:37.064
whether you like it or not.

13:37.608 --> 13:39.685
Tyrant.

13:42.740 --> 13:46.489
- Janis?
- Kenny, l'll have to call you back.

13:47.370 --> 13:49.162
Hi. Have you selected a wine?

13:49.331 --> 13:53.116
Uh, Frasier, l'm beginning to have
second thoughts about this date.

13:53.336 --> 13:54.747
lt's about Kenny.

13:54.963 --> 13:59.377
Lord, you're still thinking about him.
Listen, l know Kenny. l like Kenny.

13:59.552 --> 14:01.047
- But he's married.
- Well, l know.

14:01.221 --> 14:04.472
And yet he left his loving wife
and family at home

14:04.642 --> 14:06.884
so he could go trolling bars
for women.

14:07.061 --> 14:13.315
- Maybe he regrets that.
- Oh, yeah, sure. Men always change.

14:13.528 --> 14:15.735
- Are you saying l can't trust him?
- No.

14:16.365 --> 14:21.491
l'm saying that you deserve a man
who thinks you're as special as l do.

14:22.205 --> 14:25.207
You are very persuasive.

14:25.418 --> 14:28.088
Now, if you'll excuse me,
l will be back in one moment.

14:28.254 --> 14:29.879
All right.

14:31.008 --> 14:33.760
Dad, l thought you were gonna
clear out tonight. l've got a date.

14:33.928 --> 14:36.799
Doc, l need you in the bedroom.

14:43.982 --> 14:45.263
Pretty.

14:47.069 --> 14:49.775
- Very funny.
- l'm just gonna take Eddie for a walk

14:49.948 --> 14:52.321
and then l'll beat it on over
to McGinty's, all right?

14:52.493 --> 14:55.364
Dad. For God's sakes,
how many times do l have to tell you?

14:55.580 --> 14:57.372
My Chihuly is not a trash can.

15:02.881 --> 15:04.340
All right, Kenny, time to go.

15:05.008 --> 15:06.384
Look at her.

15:06.552 --> 15:08.461
How did l ever let
a woman like this get away?

15:08.679 --> 15:11.136
l'll tell you what. Let me work up
some preliminary thoughts

15:11.308 --> 15:13.217
- over the weekend.
- Look at this one.

15:13.394 --> 15:14.853
lt's her at the Grand Canyon.

15:15.229 --> 15:19.726
l ask you,
which one is the true natural wonder?

15:19.902 --> 15:22.572
Oh, my God.

15:23.615 --> 15:27.779
Yeah, those were
the breast-feeding months.

15:28.829 --> 15:30.538
Good times.

15:34.002 --> 15:35.462
[DOORBELL RlNGS]

15:44.808 --> 15:46.635
- Hey, Daphne.
- Hey, Roz, come on in.

15:46.810 --> 15:50.643
l can't stay. l brought you that low-fat
cookbook l was telling you about.

15:50.857 --> 15:53.229
- You look nice.
- Thanks. l'm going to a club tonight.

15:53.401 --> 15:56.439
l got this new perfume
that's just loaded with pheromones.

15:56.656 --> 15:57.735
What are those?

15:57.907 --> 16:01.324
l don't know. Some hormone
that's supposed to get a guy all excited.

16:01.537 --> 16:04.159
- And you really think it'll work?
- lt's worth a try.

16:04.373 --> 16:08.419
After all, it is approved
by the Food and Love Administration.

16:08.629 --> 16:10.788
Check it out.

16:10.965 --> 16:12.543
- l don't smell anything.
- Really?

16:12.717 --> 16:14.627
- No.
- Maybe l should put some more on.

16:14.803 --> 16:17.508
- Do you mind?
- No, go ahead.

16:21.186 --> 16:23.309
What kind of person goes out
with another man's wife

16:23.480 --> 16:25.189
and tears a family apart?

16:25.399 --> 16:27.393
- There are children involved here.
- All right.

16:27.569 --> 16:29.895
Now, listen. Let's not get
overly dramatic, all right?

16:30.114 --> 16:34.575
God, if you're listening,
let me have vengeance on his soul.

16:34.744 --> 16:37.201
- l gotta go.
- No, no, no.

16:37.373 --> 16:39.200
Listen, you're only gonna do
something rash.

16:39.375 --> 16:41.867
l'll tell you what, Kenny.
l want you to lie down on the bed.

16:42.045 --> 16:43.125
- What?
- Yes.

16:43.297 --> 16:45.420
This is a very effective
anger-management technique.

16:45.591 --> 16:47.465
- All right.
- There you go.

16:47.677 --> 16:50.679
Just lean back, close your eyes

16:51.891 --> 16:56.933
and count to a hundred thousand.

17:00.610 --> 17:02.733
Frasier, l'm ready for that wine now.

17:02.904 --> 17:06.025
- You're Kenny's wife.
- Oh, God.

17:06.200 --> 17:08.692
- How did you find out?
- Well, he's in my bedroom.

17:08.912 --> 17:10.619
- What?
- He came here asking for advice.

17:10.830 --> 17:13.832
He thought you were cheating on him.
Which you nearly were.

17:14.001 --> 17:15.496
- l've gotta get out of here.
- Right.

17:15.670 --> 17:18.243
Listen, why did you lie to me?

17:18.423 --> 17:22.208
l was angry and hurt and mixed up,

17:22.387 --> 17:24.712
and you were so nice to me
and l don't know.

17:24.890 --> 17:28.094
Yes. Right. Well, listen,
you've got to understand something.

17:28.310 --> 17:29.426
Kenny loves you.

17:29.604 --> 17:32.606
Yes, he was attracted to someone,
but you've got to forgive him for that.

17:32.775 --> 17:34.435
After all, you were attracted to me.

17:34.652 --> 17:37.144
- That was more revenge.
- Ah.

17:37.572 --> 17:39.197
Well.

17:39.992 --> 17:43.444
That's neither here nor there.
All right, listen, it was nice to meet you.

17:43.621 --> 17:45.282
lt was nice to meet you.

17:45.457 --> 17:49.705
l just want to thank you for making
an ordinary housewife feel so--

17:49.879 --> 17:52.631
KENNY: Hey, doc.
- Goodbye.

17:54.426 --> 17:56.004
That anger management's
a load of crap.

17:56.179 --> 17:58.136
Kenny, Kenny.

17:58.306 --> 18:01.391
Your wife is not cheating on you.

18:02.103 --> 18:03.265
Don't ask me how l know that.

18:03.479 --> 18:06.516
Maybe it's the hundreds of people
l've counselled over the years.

18:06.692 --> 18:08.435
Maybe it's just a hunch. l don't know.

18:08.611 --> 18:11.019
lt's just that,
yes, you two have problems.

18:11.197 --> 18:13.190
But they're the kind of problems
that people have

18:13.366 --> 18:15.775
when they've been in a relationship
for a long time.

18:15.995 --> 18:18.154
All you need to do is talk.

18:18.331 --> 18:20.490
l want you to go home.

18:20.667 --> 18:23.455
l'm sure you'll find your wife there
waiting for you.

18:24.380 --> 18:26.420
l hope you're right.

18:26.925 --> 18:29.499
- Thanks, doc.
- Oh, anytime.

18:29.678 --> 18:31.921
- That's my wife's purse.
- Hm?

18:33.266 --> 18:34.511
That's not your wife's purse.

18:35.269 --> 18:37.760
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

18:38.272 --> 18:40.265
l know my wife's purse.
l got it for her birthday.

18:40.442 --> 18:41.984
Lots of women
can have the same purse.

18:42.152 --> 18:44.441
Well, if it's not hers,
why don't you let me see it?

18:46.616 --> 18:50.282
Kenny,
l've got to tell you something.

18:50.496 --> 18:52.536
lt's a little complicated,

18:52.707 --> 18:55.827
and l'm sure that in the future,
we'll all have a good laugh over it.

18:56.044 --> 18:58.714
lt's just that, well...

18:58.881 --> 19:01.005
l did not have a date
with Janis tonight.

19:01.217 --> 19:03.590
Well, you had a date with someone.
The wine, the fire...

19:03.762 --> 19:08.591
Yes, yes, l did have a date,
but it was with, uh...

19:08.810 --> 19:11.480
- Roz?
- Exactly.

19:11.689 --> 19:14.263
What are you guys talking about?

19:18.781 --> 19:23.029
Wow, that stuff really works.

19:26.582 --> 19:29.833
- Maybe l should wipe some of it off.
- Right. Here, take your purse.

19:30.045 --> 19:32.371
Wait, Frasier, what are you talking
about? This isn't my--

19:36.052 --> 19:38.626
l don't wanna know.

19:46.607 --> 19:48.267
You dog.

19:50.862 --> 19:53.484
By the way, doc,
l owe you some chocolates.

19:53.657 --> 19:55.116
l got a little hungry in your room.

19:55.284 --> 19:58.120
l noticed that box of Fanny Farmer's
you got stuck between two books.

19:58.288 --> 19:59.664
Thanks again.

20:02.376 --> 20:05.462
l don't keep chocolate in my room.
Roz, get out here.

20:05.672 --> 20:08.294
Try to control yourself.

20:13.599 --> 20:17.015
Who stashed a box of donuts
behind Eddie's dog food?

20:17.645 --> 20:20.682
- Well, we better get going.
- Okay.

20:28.200 --> 20:29.861
Daphne?

20:30.036 --> 20:32.574
ls there something
you wanna tell me?

20:32.747 --> 20:34.741
l love you?

20:35.835 --> 20:36.914
Anything else?

20:38.129 --> 20:40.799
l love chocolate. And pastries.

20:40.966 --> 20:44.585
And, oh, God, l can't stop eating.
l'm out of control.

20:44.762 --> 20:47.301
Come here, come here, come here.
That's all right, my love.

20:47.474 --> 20:50.926
- We're gonna get you through this.
- Of course we will, Daph.

20:51.145 --> 20:53.055
You know, there are professionals
who can help.

20:53.231 --> 20:56.316
Yeah, they can wire your jaw shut,
staple your stomach,

20:56.527 --> 20:59.149
put a balloon in your gut.

20:59.322 --> 21:03.155
Thank you, Dad. l was referring
to something more like a spa, all right?

21:03.327 --> 21:05.653
Although you might look
into that jaw thing.

21:09.418 --> 21:11.744
Daphne,
l think a spa is a wonderful idea.

21:11.921 --> 21:15.172
They can oversee your diet
and plan your exercise

21:15.342 --> 21:17.169
and help you understand
why you're overeating.

21:17.344 --> 21:20.050
Yes. Most importantly, Daph,
you should know that we love you.

21:20.223 --> 21:23.972
- And that you're not alone.
- Oh, thank you.

21:24.770 --> 21:27.059
- Roz.
- No. You stay right there.

21:28.650 --> 21:32.649
l don't blame you.
l blame the people at Mantastic.
