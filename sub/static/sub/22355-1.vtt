00:20.770 --> 00:22.000
<i>Let's go.</i>

00:23.510 --> 00:27.040
<i>Oh, you're jumping?</i>
<i>That's a good jump.</i>

00:27.040 --> 00:29.680
<i>Get the ball, sweetie.
Get it. Get the ball!</i>

00:29.680 --> 00:31.280
<i>You wanna play
with your brother?</i>

00:31.280 --> 00:33.150
<i>Yeah, babe. See,
come play with Kevin.</i>

00:33.150 --> 00:34.980
<i>Wait, uh, don't you hit
your brother.</i>

00:36.250 --> 00:37.590
<i>Come on, Kev.</i>

00:55.810 --> 00:57.310
Picture this.

00:57.310 --> 01:01.640
A warehouse,
about 20000 square feet.
Windows along the side.

01:01.650 --> 01:03.650
Looks like
an ordinary warehouse.

01:03.650 --> 01:04.910
Until you get closer.

01:05.820 --> 01:08.120
And all you see are heads.

01:08.120 --> 01:09.150
Heads?

01:09.150 --> 01:10.950
What kinda heads
you talking about?

01:10.950 --> 01:15.520
Heads. Happy heads.
Smiling heads. Heads drifting
in and out of the windows.

01:15.530 --> 01:18.760
- A projection of heads?
- Like a jumbo tron?

01:18.760 --> 01:21.330
No, real heads.
Heads defying gravity.

01:21.330 --> 01:24.770
There are heads everywhere.
Everyone's having fun.

01:24.770 --> 01:26.030
Good genuine fun.

01:29.870 --> 01:32.240
The first of its kind
in the state of Louisiana.

01:32.240 --> 01:35.210
Hey, Kev. You feel
like working today, huh?

01:36.310 --> 01:39.410
See, you take the hammer
and you take the nail,

01:39.420 --> 01:42.080
you just swing the hammer.

01:42.090 --> 01:45.090
And then when
all the nails are in,
we get paid.

01:45.090 --> 01:46.890
And then we get to go home.

01:50.260 --> 01:52.190
Kev, I want to ask you
a question.

01:52.200 --> 01:56.030
You think grown ass adults
from Louisiana are gonna come

01:56.030 --> 01:59.770
to a building full
of trampolines
and jump around?

01:59.770 --> 02:03.670
Well, gymnastics and trampoline
are amongst the fastest growing
sports in America.

02:03.670 --> 02:05.110
Well, so is obesity.

02:07.310 --> 02:10.880
No offense, brother, but...
you need to get laid.

02:10.880 --> 02:14.350
Whoa, whoa, whoa. He still
hasn't done any fucking
since the incident?

02:14.350 --> 02:15.420
No.

02:18.920 --> 02:20.620
Why did you have to go bring up
the incident?

02:20.620 --> 02:22.220
I didn't bring up the incident.

02:22.230 --> 02:24.830
All right, that's fucking...
Let's get off my goddamn roof.

02:24.830 --> 02:26.130
We just got here.

02:26.130 --> 02:27.430
Where do you wanna go eat?

02:27.430 --> 02:29.430
I think I'm gonna go
to a titty bar.

02:30.670 --> 02:32.430
Are you gonna
work at all today, Kev?

02:33.640 --> 02:35.140
Just give me a minute.

02:35.140 --> 02:37.070
You know, you gotta forget
about Angie, man.

02:37.070 --> 02:39.840
Maybe the boys are right.
Maybe you gotta
get back out there.

02:39.840 --> 02:41.240
And get laid.

02:42.080 --> 02:43.210
Why don't you fuck a nurse?

02:43.210 --> 02:45.310
I know this nurse, she works
at Tulane.

02:45.320 --> 02:47.780
-Give her a call.
-No, I don't want
to fuck the nurse.

02:47.780 --> 02:49.180
Nurses like to fuck.

02:49.190 --> 02:51.420
I'm not interested. Can we talk
about something else?

02:51.420 --> 02:53.690
Listen, it's time for you
to get back in the game.

02:53.690 --> 02:55.560
I am in the game.

02:55.560 --> 02:57.190
I'm just not having sex.

03:00.830 --> 03:05.300
♪ I'm having sex, guaranteed

03:07.770 --> 03:11.970
<i>♪ My pedestal
I just won't need ♪</i>

03:16.080 --> 03:18.210
You're really starting
to fucking worry me, pal.

03:18.220 --> 03:21.120
There's no curse.
You're not cursed.

03:21.120 --> 03:22.980
Yo, Kevin, got
like a Medusa dick.

03:22.990 --> 03:25.890
You can't look directly
into the eye or it'll turn
you into stone.

03:27.420 --> 03:29.660
You can't let
one girl ruin your whole
goddamn life, Kevin.

03:43.010 --> 03:45.570
Oh, shit.

03:45.580 --> 03:47.240
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

03:48.840 --> 03:55.280
Fuck. God. God, you're
so fucking stupid, Kevin.

03:55.290 --> 03:57.950
That apron suits you.
You should keep it.

03:57.950 --> 04:02.290
Oh. And please,
take whatever you like
from the Le Creuset stuff.

04:02.630 --> 04:04.030
In fact...

04:07.760 --> 04:09.300
Stupid Kevin.

04:10.030 --> 04:12.070
You're doing okay there, Senor?

04:13.240 --> 04:14.270
Oh, hey.

04:15.300 --> 04:16.570
Yeah, I'm good.

04:17.940 --> 04:20.010
They don't mind
if we take the sodas?

04:20.010 --> 04:22.580
- No, it's cool.
- Oh, that's nice.

04:27.280 --> 04:28.220
Thanks.

04:28.650 --> 04:29.620
No problem.

04:30.850 --> 04:33.320
Guys giving you
a hard time up there?

04:33.660 --> 04:35.290
Who? Oh!

04:36.160 --> 04:37.260
No.

04:39.190 --> 04:40.660
What do you think her name is?

04:41.460 --> 04:45.670
I was gonna go with Muriel or...
or Sasha

04:46.570 --> 04:48.040
You think Sasha's married?

04:48.840 --> 04:51.340
Uh... yeah.

04:51.340 --> 04:53.880
Maybe, yeah.
I don't know.

04:53.880 --> 04:56.380
One thing I can tell you
about catering...

04:56.380 --> 04:58.310
some of these girls
really know how to party.

04:59.750 --> 05:01.020
Whoa!

05:01.020 --> 05:02.650
You just got a smile.

05:03.590 --> 05:04.750
What?

05:04.750 --> 05:06.990
- No. I don't think so.
- You did.

05:06.990 --> 05:09.390
- I saw her, man.
- No.

05:11.290 --> 05:12.290
Mmm.

05:13.530 --> 05:14.900
Juicy.

05:14.900 --> 05:16.260
So, is this guy an asshole?

05:17.470 --> 05:18.400
What guy?

05:19.200 --> 05:21.600
Uh, the guy,
whose house this is.

05:22.670 --> 05:24.440
What makes you say that?

05:24.440 --> 05:27.040
Well, he's got a chair
in the shape of a hand.

05:30.650 --> 05:32.580
You don't like the chair.

05:32.580 --> 05:35.620
The only one who has
enough money to buy
joke furniture is...

05:35.620 --> 05:36.750
probably an asshole.

05:38.650 --> 05:40.360
It wasn't meant to be funny.

05:40.360 --> 05:44.930
Oh, shit. I'm sorry. No, you...
you have a really great house.

05:44.930 --> 05:46.930
What's your name?

05:46.930 --> 05:49.360
- Kevin.
- What do you say, Kev?

05:50.570 --> 05:51.730
Call me Hank.

05:52.840 --> 05:55.170
You should come
to my party tonight.

05:55.170 --> 05:59.970
There's gonna be
a lot of women here and...
a lot of these ladies are...

05:59.980 --> 06:01.640
they'd be high on narcotics.

06:02.680 --> 06:05.580
Oh. No, I'm good.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.650
Are you? Are you good?

06:11.390 --> 06:12.420
You're okay.

06:13.760 --> 06:15.390
- Shit.
- Hey!

06:15.390 --> 06:18.560
Party starts at eight.
Hope to see you.

06:18.560 --> 06:23.230
Oh, and... if you want
the hand chair, it's yours.

06:43.820 --> 06:45.520
Oh, I don't know...

06:45.520 --> 06:48.560
- I mean, I feel sad for him.
- What does he do?

06:48.560 --> 06:50.220
- Huh?
- What is he doing up there?

06:50.230 --> 06:52.930
He's a roofer. He's roofing
up on the house, you know?

06:52.930 --> 06:54.260
And he wasn't,
he was a nice guy.

06:54.260 --> 06:57.030
I mean, I didn't get
to talk to him, but...

06:57.030 --> 06:59.370
He shouldn't be giving
people roofies, man.

07:06.980 --> 07:08.380
Show me
that cork trick again.

07:08.380 --> 07:10.450
He showed you
like 30 times.

07:10.450 --> 07:11.880
It takes brains, bro.

07:11.880 --> 07:14.380
Whatever. At least I don't think
my fucking dick is cursed.

07:14.380 --> 07:16.050
What did I say? I don't wanna
talk about it.

07:16.050 --> 07:17.320
Why? Just tell us, come on.

07:17.320 --> 07:19.220
He sounds like an idiot
when he talks about it.

07:19.220 --> 07:22.960
No, because every time
I even think about sex,
something bad happens.

07:22.960 --> 07:24.390
And you bring up Angie today,

07:24.390 --> 07:26.530
and I nearly take off my thumb
with a fucking claw hammer.

07:26.530 --> 07:30.000
-Let me see, let me see that.
-My dick is cursed,
end of story.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.400
Listen, you had
a string of bad luck, right?

07:32.400 --> 07:34.840
Your dick's not
fucking cursed, okay?

07:34.840 --> 07:37.570
I don't know. Maybe if I just
stopped fucking around...

07:37.570 --> 07:39.810
you know, make me...
maybe she'll take me back.

07:41.680 --> 07:42.610
What?

07:44.010 --> 07:47.150
Okay. Let's just
get back to the curse
of the wretched dick.

07:47.150 --> 07:48.880
So, you think it's possessed,

07:48.890 --> 07:51.520
or is it surrounded by,
like, paranormal activity?

08:00.500 --> 08:02.230
Such a good looking kid.

08:03.630 --> 08:05.630
He swears off sex.

08:05.640 --> 08:08.370
Man, that's a crime
against nature.

08:08.370 --> 08:11.040
Are you still talking
about the fucking roofer?

08:11.040 --> 08:13.270
Hey, he just seems so sad,
you know?

08:14.340 --> 08:16.510
You know what
a fucking coke loop is, man?

08:16.510 --> 08:18.480
You're like a hamster
in a wormhole.

08:18.480 --> 08:21.150
I can't, I just, I can't
hear it anymore, Hank.

08:21.150 --> 08:23.680
I'm going insane.

08:27.190 --> 08:29.690
I've just had
a revelation of magnitude.

08:30.790 --> 08:34.260
Oh, Carl, this is big.
Can you see how big?

08:34.260 --> 08:36.400
It's pretty fucking big.

08:36.400 --> 08:38.370
I'm gonna get this kid laid.

08:39.700 --> 08:41.870
This is... This is fate!

08:41.870 --> 08:43.500
I have to get this kid laid.

08:43.510 --> 08:46.810
You're damn straight, you do.

08:48.010 --> 08:49.880
I can see it so clearly.

08:49.880 --> 08:54.920
You're gonna
fucking go down as one
of the greats. I'm telling you.

08:54.920 --> 08:57.290
Okay. Has anyone seen my phone?

08:59.390 --> 09:01.260
Fuck, are you kidding me?

09:01.260 --> 09:02.860
- If you told everyone
to leave their phone here...
- Where's my phone?

09:02.860 --> 09:04.690
Oh, I gotta find him!

09:04.690 --> 09:06.760
You're kidding, right?

09:06.760 --> 09:10.360
- It's too much responsibility.
-  I can't deal with that.

09:12.570 --> 09:16.040
Steve!
Steve, we're late.

09:16.040 --> 09:18.270
Kevin, relax!
I'm coming.

09:19.910 --> 09:21.610
Nice outfit.

09:21.610 --> 09:24.410
-Haven't seen that
since first light Communion.
-Better than shorts.

09:24.410 --> 09:26.380
- Why?
- It's a business meeting.

09:26.380 --> 09:28.120
It's Ted! He knows us.

09:28.120 --> 09:30.350
I don't want him
going around telling Angie
we're some kind of joke.

09:30.350 --> 09:33.090
Oh, Jesus Christ, Kev!

09:34.720 --> 09:38.190
You gotta stop stressing out
about this Angie thing,
you know?

09:38.190 --> 09:40.060
I mean, it's been over a year.

09:40.060 --> 09:41.230
It's been nine months.

09:41.230 --> 09:42.460
Close enough.

09:45.330 --> 09:49.040
Okay, so...
Trampoline world.

09:49.040 --> 09:52.610
We'll have
six four-by-four rebounders
over there,

09:52.610 --> 09:56.980
and two six-by-six on that base
in the back there.

09:57.480 --> 10:00.010
Kids jumping everywhere.

10:00.020 --> 10:01.350
3D dodgeball.

10:01.950 --> 10:03.780
Isn't all dodgeball 3D?

10:03.790 --> 10:05.820
Um, 4D dodgeball.

10:06.690 --> 10:09.060
Do people really wanna
go trampolining?

10:09.060 --> 10:12.790
Ah, trampolining is one
of the fastest growing sports
in America.

10:12.800 --> 10:16.460
Funny, I guess I missed
the Trampoline Superbowl
last year.

10:18.870 --> 10:20.370
Sorry, that's in poor taste.

10:20.370 --> 10:22.740
Look, boys, I loved your daddy,
all right?

10:22.740 --> 10:26.910
But he really never was
very good at math either.

10:26.910 --> 10:29.610
Look, what I'm trying to say is
y'all's numbers don't add up.

10:29.610 --> 10:31.950
You see, what happens
to Trampoline world

10:31.950 --> 10:34.450
if you don't make your nut
for the first two months, hmm?

10:34.920 --> 10:36.020
You shut her down?

10:38.190 --> 10:40.720
- Well, no, we just...
- No? So...

10:41.260 --> 10:42.590
how do you make payroll?

10:43.760 --> 10:45.260
How about you
just come in
for ten?

10:45.260 --> 10:46.660
Ten thousand?

10:46.660 --> 10:48.230
I could do that.

10:48.230 --> 10:51.430
What happens to my ten
if you don't sell
the other shares?

10:53.840 --> 10:55.070
Got anything, Steve?

10:56.100 --> 10:57.640
No. I lose it.

10:58.270 --> 10:59.540
Just what I thought.

11:00.140 --> 11:01.410
I just don't get it.

11:01.980 --> 11:03.040
Sorry, I'm out.

11:07.650 --> 11:09.950
- Why didn't you jump in?
- Honestly...

11:11.290 --> 11:12.920
I don't get the plan myself.

11:18.430 --> 11:20.590
You should go
on a vacation or something.

11:20.600 --> 11:24.200
Costa Rica,
Palm Beach would be nice.

11:24.200 --> 11:27.540
I mean, maybe right now
is not the right time
for Trampoline world.

11:27.540 --> 11:30.500
I mean, it might be
the right idea,
just not the right time.

11:30.510 --> 11:31.740
Well, it has to be.

11:32.270 --> 11:33.410
Huh?

11:34.440 --> 11:35.940
I already put down the deposit.

11:36.880 --> 11:38.510
A deposit? With what?

11:46.290 --> 11:47.960
To knock down the house.

11:49.520 --> 11:51.660
Kevin, you gotta be
fucking kidding me.

11:51.660 --> 11:53.730
Did you even read this thing?

11:53.730 --> 11:54.830
It's a lien.

11:56.200 --> 11:57.930
It's a fucking six month term.

11:57.930 --> 12:00.630
-Dude, you'll lose
your fucking home.
-Not...

12:00.640 --> 12:02.600
if Trampoline world succeeds.

12:04.140 --> 12:06.110
Trampolines. Are you kidding me?

12:09.240 --> 12:11.510
Seriously though,
the female fruit bat,

12:11.510 --> 12:14.250
she licks the male's cock
while they're having sex.

12:14.250 --> 12:15.920
How is that even possible?

12:15.920 --> 12:19.520
She bends. The female fruit bat
is very bendy.

12:19.520 --> 12:22.490
Well, but, isn't the tip
already up inside her?

12:23.560 --> 12:25.430
She doesn't lick
the head, jackass.

12:25.430 --> 12:28.300
She licks the shaft,
makes him fuck longer.

12:28.300 --> 12:30.630
Well, wouldn't that
make it shorter?

12:31.330 --> 12:32.900
Apparently not for a fruit bat.

12:34.370 --> 12:36.470
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, it's me. It's Hank.</i>

12:36.470 --> 12:39.570
- Oh. Hey, Hank.
<i>- You missed my party, man.</i>

12:39.580 --> 12:42.310
Yeah, uh, sorry about that.
Something uh, came up.

12:42.310 --> 12:44.040
I wanna do something

12:44.050 --> 12:47.010
-I can't understand.
<i>-I'm talking</i>
<i>sex guaranteed, man.</i>

12:47.020 --> 12:50.220
- What's "text guaranteed?"
<i>- Not text, sex.</i>

12:50.220 --> 12:51.720
Oh, sex.

12:51.720 --> 12:55.360
I'm here
with this amazing creature.
She's called Zade.

12:55.360 --> 12:56.990
She's amazing.

12:56.990 --> 13:00.490
Now, Zade... wants
to have sex with you.

13:03.300 --> 13:04.570
<i>What, is she desperate?</i>

13:04.570 --> 13:07.800
No, she's not desperate, okay?
This is her job.

13:07.800 --> 13:09.570
<i>Oh, no, I'm not having sex
with a hooker.</i>

13:09.570 --> 13:11.610
She's not a prostitute, okay?

13:11.610 --> 13:15.080
She's...
She's like a...

13:16.280 --> 13:18.110
an expert. Um...

13:19.550 --> 13:21.150
Let's say... a sexpert.

13:22.820 --> 13:25.990
She's just got
a lot of sex-pertise,
you know what I mean?

13:25.990 --> 13:29.490
Oh, uh, that's nice of you, man.
But, that's not really my thing.

13:29.490 --> 13:31.930
Oh, come on, man. Relax!

13:32.560 --> 13:34.260
This is real intimacy.

13:35.460 --> 13:38.570
And frankly, it sounds
like you need it.

13:38.570 --> 13:40.500
Uh, I don't understand
what you mean.

13:40.500 --> 13:44.710
Think of her like a chef.
Like, you know, a chef,
that comes to somebody's house,

13:44.710 --> 13:47.170
cooks up a meal,
but just for you.

13:47.180 --> 13:50.480
And this chef makes
a thousand dollars an hour.

13:50.480 --> 13:53.250
- A thousand dollars?
- Just... listen to me.

13:54.080 --> 13:56.620
This is fate calling, Kevin.

13:57.620 --> 14:00.390
Drop the hammer,
get off the roof,

14:00.390 --> 14:03.290
and get your fucking ass
to my party.

14:05.830 --> 14:08.360
Yo, Kev, what the hell is
"sex guaranteed," man?

14:08.360 --> 14:11.770
That guy Hank just called me
and invited me over
to have sex with a hooker.

14:11.770 --> 14:13.900
- Can you believe that?
- A prostitute?

14:13.900 --> 14:16.100
He's out of his mind. I'm not
having sex with a hooker.

14:16.710 --> 14:18.040
Hookers don't count.

14:19.140 --> 14:21.010
- Everyone counts.
- Not hookers.

14:21.010 --> 14:23.540
It's not the same another girl.
They're a subset.

14:24.480 --> 14:25.910
So, what was
the thousand dollars about?

14:26.920 --> 14:28.350
I guess that's how much
she costs.

14:28.350 --> 14:29.850
A day?

14:29.850 --> 14:31.120
I think an hour.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.550
Oh, you gotta do it.

14:32.560 --> 14:34.320
That'd be like fucking
a professor of sex.

14:34.320 --> 14:36.920
She's gonna know
more shit than you've
ever even thought of.

14:36.930 --> 14:41.660
It's gonna be like,
like caving with like a miner.

14:41.660 --> 14:43.760
Nah, nah, he's right. This could
be good for you, Kevin.

14:43.770 --> 14:47.270
Just confront your fears.
This could break the curse.

14:47.270 --> 14:49.500
Well, I'm not doing it.
It's just stupid, I'm going...

14:49.510 --> 14:51.010
Oh, you're doing it.

14:51.010 --> 14:52.570
Man, and, dude might
throw you some cash

14:52.580 --> 14:54.980
for you know,
your bouncing heads
and what not.

14:54.980 --> 14:58.980
Yeah, I mean I guess I could
stop by, and then I wouldn't
have to have the sex, right?

15:00.250 --> 15:02.020
I didn't say that shit.

15:02.020 --> 15:04.550
"I guess" No, no, no.
Do the fucking math, Kev.

15:04.550 --> 15:08.320
It's a rich guy getting
fucked up
in a goddamn mansion.

15:08.320 --> 15:10.390
This is your investor.

15:10.390 --> 15:11.960
Come on, we're going right now.

15:15.160 --> 15:16.660
I wanna go to the party.

15:17.730 --> 15:19.870
- That's a weird motherfucker.
- That is fucked up.

15:19.870 --> 15:22.440
Did we just not get invited
to the party?

15:22.440 --> 15:24.340
- I guess not.
- That's some bullshit.

15:29.580 --> 15:32.680
These are the rules
of Egg fight.

15:32.680 --> 15:35.380
Open hand strikes only.

15:35.380 --> 15:37.790
There will be no fists allowed.

15:37.790 --> 15:40.450
Should the egg crack
on your mouth,

15:40.460 --> 15:42.920
spit it out, stupid!

15:42.930 --> 15:44.960
Because you are
the vanquished man.

15:46.230 --> 15:48.000
All right. Commence!

15:59.340 --> 16:01.110
You have offended me.

16:06.720 --> 16:09.650
I think I'm gonna start
with the fastest growing stuff
first and then move

16:09.650 --> 16:11.590
into our big vision
for the place.

16:11.590 --> 16:15.160
Maybe you wanna play along
a little bit before, you know,
you start asking for money.

16:15.160 --> 16:18.230
Look, if I grab
the whole investment block
here today,

16:18.230 --> 16:20.630
I mean, I can take Angie
to the place, I could show her
the lease...

16:20.630 --> 16:23.330
Forget about Angie.
This is about money.

16:23.330 --> 16:26.700
If this guy wants
to get you laid,
then let him get you laid.

16:26.700 --> 16:28.670
You gotta do whatever
this guy wants,

16:28.670 --> 16:30.740
so that he will give you
the money.

16:33.380 --> 16:34.980
It's a logical investment.

16:38.110 --> 16:39.280
I know it is.

16:40.920 --> 16:42.550
Just go in there and have sex.

16:42.550 --> 16:43.920
I'm not having sex, Steve.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.090
Go on, get the fuck out of here.

16:47.020 --> 16:48.060
Be a man.

16:55.200 --> 16:56.330
Give me a min.

17:00.570 --> 17:02.000
Hi. Um...

17:02.840 --> 17:04.770
I was invited by the owner
of the house.

17:06.640 --> 17:09.839
Ah, Jesus. Sorry. Um...

17:31.800 --> 17:33.800
I'm taking a shit, bro.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.400
Oh, um, sorry.

17:50.750 --> 17:54.050
Go, go, go, go.

18:12.940 --> 18:16.640
That's how you do it!
That's how you do it!

18:16.650 --> 18:19.310
Get it!

18:19.320 --> 18:21.780
You looking at me crazy?
I'll fuck you up, mister.

18:24.020 --> 18:26.720
What do you say, Kevin?
You made it, buddy.

18:26.720 --> 18:29.490
I thought you might
not show. Drink?

18:29.490 --> 18:30.590
Yeah, sure.

18:30.590 --> 18:32.690
- Take a seat.
- This is the guy?

18:32.700 --> 18:35.860
Kevin, I'd like to introduce you
to Zade.

18:36.970 --> 18:39.900
Zade, this is Kevin.

18:44.270 --> 18:46.410
Hi. I'm Zade.

18:47.710 --> 18:50.340
- So, how's life, Kevin?
- Life's good.

18:59.850 --> 19:01.160
There you go, Kev.

19:01.660 --> 19:03.190
Try that.

19:03.190 --> 19:04.960
You know that business
I was telling you about,

19:04.960 --> 19:07.730
yeah, it's... trampolining.

19:07.730 --> 19:10.400
Mmm. Jumping.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.330
You got a business model
for that?
How do you monetize that?

19:12.330 --> 19:16.170
Yeah. Um, trampolining is one
of the fastest growing sports
in America.

19:16.170 --> 19:18.940
They have them in schools now.
It's huge in Asia.

19:19.910 --> 19:21.610
And how high do people get?

19:23.180 --> 19:25.950
Well, three footers average,
but professionals get
a bit higher.

19:25.950 --> 19:28.180
- They got all kinds of stuff.
- Like what?

19:29.120 --> 19:31.950
Well, there's
Sky Slam basketball.

19:31.950 --> 19:34.660
Foam pits,
synchronized trampolining.

19:34.660 --> 19:36.620
Synchronized trampolining?

19:36.630 --> 19:39.160
- There's synchronized trampolining.
-  -That's crazy.

19:39.160 --> 19:41.830
Yeah, you just get
two trampolines side by side,

19:41.830 --> 19:44.530
with some athletes on one
and the other and...

19:44.530 --> 19:47.940
That's what you got there
on the metal section
at the Olympics.

19:47.940 --> 19:50.170
Yeah, now we're
in the rhythm, see?

19:51.310 --> 19:53.540
This is... this is great.

19:53.540 --> 19:55.280
It feels pretty good.

19:55.280 --> 19:56.840
- Yes!
- With weekend traffic,

19:56.850 --> 20:01.620
we expect 500,
and with an entry fee
of $12.20.

20:01.620 --> 20:03.050
it's gonna be a real earner.

20:03.050 --> 20:05.550
How many of these trampolines
have you got over at your place?

20:05.550 --> 20:09.760
And how many people can actually
synchronize at any one time?

20:09.760 --> 20:13.660
Oh, we're thinking of starting
with, you know, 30...
30 trampolines.

20:13.660 --> 20:15.060
Ooh. Huh.

20:15.060 --> 20:16.800
I could actually take you guys
there right now.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.970
-Wait, wait, wait.
No, let's do...
-What?

20:18.970 --> 20:21.770
Let's do... on the count
of three and then we'll do
like, a starjump.

20:21.770 --> 20:23.840
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:23.840 --> 20:25.970
One, two, three.

20:28.140 --> 20:30.110
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

20:30.110 --> 20:32.910
Let me tell you something,
that is a terrible investment.

20:32.920 --> 20:36.920
Kids... they're
unreliable, fickle.

20:36.920 --> 20:41.420
-Think about the liability.
What would happen to you?
-Carl, please. Come on, man.

20:41.420 --> 20:43.620
He's speaking about his dream,
his passion.

20:44.390 --> 20:45.390
His passion.

20:46.630 --> 20:48.430
Right!

20:48.430 --> 20:51.870
I want you to two
to get to know each other,
have a little alone time, okay?

20:51.870 --> 20:55.770
Citizens, everybody!
We're all moving
to the tennis court

20:55.770 --> 20:57.140
- right now.
- Tennis!

20:57.140 --> 20:59.340
- Whoa, we'll come with you.
- No, no, no, no.

20:59.340 --> 21:02.210
Zade here, she's going
to make everything all right.

21:02.210 --> 21:03.280
Yeah, but...

21:04.110 --> 21:05.710
I want this to happen.

21:06.510 --> 21:07.710
Yeah.

21:07.720 --> 21:09.920
Wait a minute,
how come she can't come with?

21:09.920 --> 21:12.650
Carl! Tennis court, man,
come on!

21:19.960 --> 21:21.600
Okay. Um...

21:21.600 --> 21:23.260
- Hi again.
- Hi.

21:25.770 --> 21:27.930
You guys head to the game room,

21:27.940 --> 21:30.900
grab the rackets,
I'll meet you on the court.

21:30.910 --> 21:33.310
We got it. Hey,
where are you going?

21:34.440 --> 21:36.010
Putting on my whites.

21:38.450 --> 21:40.410
Do you wanna watch me
touch myself?

21:40.980 --> 21:43.680
I'd fucking love to cum.

21:43.690 --> 21:46.120
I get really wet really quick.

21:47.660 --> 21:49.190
Um, that is cool.

21:49.190 --> 21:51.020
Um, what do you like?

21:51.460 --> 21:52.630
I'll do anything.

21:53.560 --> 21:55.560
Want me to be someone, hmm?

21:56.230 --> 21:57.500
Who do you want me to be?

21:57.500 --> 22:00.230
It's not that.
You don't understand, okay?

22:03.270 --> 22:04.710
None of this was your fault.

22:06.140 --> 22:09.680
I was broken and useless
before you left me.

22:11.310 --> 22:13.380
It's like I don't even
know how...

22:14.650 --> 22:16.580
regular people breathe anymore.

22:19.120 --> 22:24.290
And I, I love you and I wanna,
I wanna thank you for being
so patient with me

22:24.690 --> 22:27.260
for so long.

22:27.260 --> 22:28.860
- Ya!
- Ya!

22:28.860 --> 22:31.000
- Ya!
- Ya!

22:31.000 --> 22:34.740
There will be a lot
of porking now.

22:34.740 --> 22:39.070
I will be shtupping you, oh ya!

22:39.070 --> 22:41.710
- Ya!
- Well, I've learned now...

22:44.050 --> 22:46.210
that I'm not good enough
for you, Karen.

22:47.920 --> 22:49.180
Never was.

22:52.990 --> 22:55.320
Not even good enough
for this world anymore.

22:59.160 --> 23:00.590
But for once...

23:02.860 --> 23:04.800
for once I'm gonna do
the right thing.

23:07.740 --> 23:09.340
<i>Au revoir, Cherie.</i>

23:11.870 --> 23:13.170
Au revoir.

23:14.580 --> 23:16.680
I like that.

23:17.580 --> 23:18.850
I like that a lot.

23:19.610 --> 23:21.210
Feel how wet I get.

23:23.180 --> 23:25.220
Yup. But, um...

23:28.390 --> 23:31.930
Look, you're so hot, okay?
It's not you, it's me.

23:31.930 --> 23:33.330
What do you want?

23:34.660 --> 23:35.700
You wanna get weird?

23:36.800 --> 23:38.830
No, I don't wanna get weird.

23:41.700 --> 23:43.970
I want to fuck you.

23:43.970 --> 23:47.110
- Okay.
- I'm getting paid to fuck you.

23:47.110 --> 23:49.240
If I don't fuck you, I look bad,

23:49.240 --> 23:50.610
and this is a new gig for me,

23:50.610 --> 23:52.850
so how about you just
let me fuck you

23:52.850 --> 23:54.550
and we both go
about our business.

23:54.550 --> 23:57.750
Look, obviously, I want to,
okay? You're beautiful.

23:57.750 --> 24:00.990
But, I'm on a hiatus right now.

24:00.990 --> 24:04.420
There's this other girl, okay?
Well, it's her hiatus, really.

24:04.430 --> 24:07.030
But I just... I'm not
having sex right now, okay?

24:07.030 --> 24:09.260
I'm, I'm happy to lie for you.

24:09.260 --> 24:11.770
- I'm a good salesman.
- Oh, fuck you.

24:15.500 --> 24:17.540
He won't fuck me, sorry Hank.

24:19.810 --> 24:21.240
I will fuck her.

24:21.240 --> 24:22.640
I actually don't.

24:22.640 --> 24:25.150
It'll make you feel better,
Kevin, please.

24:25.150 --> 24:29.680
I'm not gonna beg him.
We were having fun
before this asswipe showed up.

24:29.690 --> 24:31.990
I'm sorry, I'll go.

24:31.990 --> 24:34.960
You're not going!
How's about that?

24:34.960 --> 24:37.320
Kevin here wants
to win his lady back

24:37.330 --> 24:40.230
and thinks that celibacy is
the way to go.

24:40.230 --> 24:41.800
Not always the way, you know?

24:41.800 --> 24:44.930
Absolutely not! If you really
want her back,

24:44.930 --> 24:47.130
the first thing you should do is
fuck me.

24:47.140 --> 24:49.400
She makes
a compelling argument, Kev.

24:49.400 --> 24:52.710
Why don't we just go
somewhere quiet
so we can at least talk?

24:58.210 --> 25:01.310
Look, if I told you the reason
I don't wanna do it,
you'd understand.

25:01.320 --> 25:04.150
No one's judging here.
It's a house rule.

25:04.150 --> 25:06.790
This is
a no-judgment zone, okay?

25:07.720 --> 25:08.920
It's personal. It's...

25:10.120 --> 25:11.560
I've got this problem...

25:13.090 --> 25:15.760
with my dick.

25:15.760 --> 25:19.300
-Is it a wart?
-No, it's not that kinda thing.
It's...

25:21.240 --> 25:23.200
It's like my dick is cursed.

25:24.070 --> 25:25.240
What?

25:25.240 --> 25:27.110
There's no such thing
as a cursed dick.

25:27.110 --> 25:30.980
Really? 'Cause I've fucked
things up in my life
and all because of my dick.

25:30.980 --> 25:33.780
And I've decided to just kinda
leave it alone for a while.

25:34.950 --> 25:36.750
You're leaving your dick alone?

25:36.750 --> 25:40.250
Yes. Look, I get it, all right?
I'm a freak, but...

25:40.260 --> 25:42.460
Don't call yourself a freak.

25:42.460 --> 25:44.760
You can share anything with us.

25:51.070 --> 25:53.570
The first time
I jerked off, right?

25:53.570 --> 25:56.900
I'm in bed sick,
home from school, and...

25:56.910 --> 26:02.340
I'm watching TV
and the shuttle Columbia
breaks apart on re-entry.

26:02.340 --> 26:05.680
You think you made
the space shuttle explode.

26:06.710 --> 26:08.050
Indirectly.

26:08.050 --> 26:11.620
Kevin, that was an accident.
You can't take that personally.

26:14.960 --> 26:17.290
First girl I had sex with
almost died.

26:17.290 --> 26:20.560
Zade, please.

26:20.560 --> 26:24.800
I'm serious. We were 16.
And we'd been dating
for about a month.

26:24.800 --> 26:29.570
Well, their parents were
out of town so we had
a little wine.

26:29.570 --> 26:33.170
Well, we started making out,
and I finally get this condom on

26:33.180 --> 26:35.110
and I'm going in and out

26:35.110 --> 26:40.650
and we're making noises
and she starts to scream,
so I think I'm doing awesome.

26:40.650 --> 26:42.480
But then...

26:42.480 --> 26:45.590
she ruptured a cyst
or something.

26:45.590 --> 26:47.350
And she has to have surgery.

26:47.360 --> 26:49.590
And for the next three days,
we're in the hospital.

26:50.320 --> 26:52.330
She had them before she met you.

26:53.960 --> 26:55.900
You're missing the point.

26:55.900 --> 27:00.930
Nine months ago, I was engaged
to the most wonderful girl
in the world.

27:00.940 --> 27:04.540
We were at our joint bachelor
and bachelorette party.

27:25.230 --> 27:27.630
Wait a minute, that's not
you being cursed.

27:27.630 --> 27:31.300
That's you getting caught
getting a blowjob
off a stripper.

27:31.300 --> 27:32.670
Yeah, because I'm
a horny asshole

27:32.670 --> 27:34.030
and I just should have said no.

27:35.170 --> 27:37.570
Anyways, I tried
to explain myself.

27:38.040 --> 27:39.410
Angie, wait.

27:41.580 --> 27:44.980
Angie, she tied my hands! Angie!

27:44.980 --> 27:47.110
<i>She moved out the next day.</i>

27:47.120 --> 27:51.020
Because of my dick,
I lost the one thing
I truly cared about.

27:55.390 --> 27:58.090
I mean, that's the saddest story
I've ever heard.

28:00.700 --> 28:04.100
His dick isn't cursed.
He just got caught cheating.
End of story.

28:04.100 --> 28:08.570
No, no. That's way
too many things
to happen to one guy.

28:09.270 --> 28:11.400
He lost his one true love.

28:11.410 --> 28:13.570
There's nothing worse
in the whole world.

28:14.340 --> 28:16.080
He's just a narcissist.

28:17.880 --> 28:19.380
How am I a narcissist?

28:19.380 --> 28:22.120
You think the world revolves
around your dick.

28:22.120 --> 28:24.120
I don't want it to,
it just does.

28:24.120 --> 28:27.620
No. Shit happens.
It's just life.

28:27.620 --> 28:29.390
Didn't you hear his story?

28:29.390 --> 28:31.220
This man is cursed.

28:31.230 --> 28:35.430
This is
fucking ridiculous.
None of this is connected.

28:35.430 --> 28:37.960
Let's just have sex.
Nothing bad is gonna happen.

28:37.970 --> 28:39.500
Are you serious, right now?

28:39.500 --> 28:40.670
After everything I just told you

28:40.670 --> 28:42.240
you still wanna
have sex with me?

28:42.240 --> 28:44.700
Trust me, I know what I'm doing.

28:44.710 --> 28:45.910
And we don't have to have sex,

28:45.910 --> 28:48.440
I can just
touch it a little bit,

28:48.440 --> 28:50.980
Just do it, Kev. Give it a try.

28:51.580 --> 28:53.580
See, isn't that nice?

28:55.950 --> 28:58.790
-Guys, Carl's in trouble.
We need help. Come on.
-Oh, shit!

29:01.460 --> 29:03.620
Fucking...

29:07.660 --> 29:08.960
Jesus.

29:08.960 --> 29:10.400
It won't go down.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.500
Yeah. Too many
little blue pills, baby.

29:12.500 --> 29:14.470
Oh, shit!

29:15.340 --> 29:17.140
Oh, there's
something wrong here.

29:17.140 --> 29:19.370
- I'm in pain!
- Carl.

29:19.370 --> 29:21.410
Be honest with me
how many did you take?

29:21.410 --> 29:23.910
A 130 milligrams.

29:23.910 --> 29:25.550
God, man.

29:25.550 --> 29:28.980
You're not a rhinoceros.
Get some ice, Kevin. Now!

29:33.320 --> 29:34.620
Oh my god.

29:38.890 --> 29:40.030
Breathe, breathe.

29:40.030 --> 29:41.230
- I got ice.
- All right.

29:42.130 --> 29:43.460
The hell is this?

29:44.670 --> 29:45.700
Ready?

29:49.340 --> 29:51.370
- No! No!
- Hold on.

29:54.540 --> 29:56.910
-Okay. Okay.
-All right, Carl.
Listen, you got this.

29:56.910 --> 29:58.810
You can do this,
I know you can, all right?

29:58.810 --> 30:01.410
It's like an itch. You just
have to disassociate
yourself from it.

30:01.420 --> 30:03.150
Fucking itch!

30:04.190 --> 30:06.020
Trust him, Carl.

30:06.020 --> 30:09.060
Okay, look. I haven't had sex
in nine months, okay?
I know what I'm doing.

30:09.060 --> 30:11.020
Just listen to me, right.

30:11.030 --> 30:14.190
What I want you to do is
imagine you're Anne Frank.

30:15.460 --> 30:18.000
Remember the
little Jewish girl
in the attic?

30:18.000 --> 30:20.330
She had to lie real quietly
otherwise they were
gonna shoot her.

30:20.340 --> 30:22.700
- I remember fucking Anne Frank!
- Okay.

30:22.700 --> 30:26.110
All right.
Just close your eyes,
you're in the attic.

30:26.110 --> 30:29.040
You can hear the sound
of the boots on the cobblestone.

30:29.040 --> 30:31.680
Don't make a sound, okay?
Don't even move.

30:31.680 --> 30:33.480
Otherwise the Nazis are
gonna get you.

30:33.480 --> 30:37.850
I don't give a fuck
about the fucking Nazis!
My cock is going to explode.

30:37.850 --> 30:39.650
Please take me to the hospital.

30:39.650 --> 30:43.590
Carl, what you've got is called
Priapism. No hospitals.

30:43.590 --> 30:46.560
I know a better place.
Zade, straight ahead.

30:46.560 --> 30:48.090
Whatever you say, boss.

30:55.040 --> 30:59.370
Do you ever notice how...
people are only really real
when they're sick,

30:59.370 --> 31:01.510
- or they're dying.
- Or orgasming.

31:01.510 --> 31:03.080
Bad things always come from sex.

31:03.080 --> 31:04.580
Oh, shut up.

31:04.580 --> 31:08.010
It's true. Without sex
there wouldn't be fighting,
divorce, wars.

31:08.020 --> 31:10.150
What the fuck
are you talking about?

31:10.150 --> 31:14.590
Without sex, there is also
no release, no fun.

31:16.730 --> 31:19.230
Okay. Bad things come
from recreational sex.

31:19.230 --> 31:21.360
What's recreational sex to you?

31:21.360 --> 31:24.800
Careless sex.
Sex that nobody put
any thought into.

31:24.800 --> 31:28.130
Oh my God, you are a freak.

31:32.410 --> 31:36.380
- What's in this?
- IV therapy. They had
my recipe on file.

31:36.380 --> 31:38.780
- Fuck yeah.
- I'm serious.

31:38.780 --> 31:41.380
I'm not gonna let
this guy's life be ruined.

31:41.380 --> 31:42.850
How are you gonna do that?

31:42.850 --> 31:44.980
That's nice, Hank,
but there's nothing
you can do.

31:44.990 --> 31:46.420
I need to just...

31:46.420 --> 31:49.890
make my business a success
and hope that Angie sees
I've changed.

31:50.690 --> 31:54.390
Yes. That's it. You got it!

31:54.400 --> 31:56.160
You're gonna go to Angie's,

31:56.160 --> 31:58.030
you're gonna tell her that
your trampoline thingy's
got off the ground

31:58.030 --> 32:01.400
-and you're a new man.
You're a genius!
-Yeah, but...

32:01.400 --> 32:03.740
- But that's not true.
- It is true.

32:03.740 --> 32:05.270
You let me fix this,

32:06.370 --> 32:08.610
and I'll invest
in trampoline world.

32:10.040 --> 32:11.540
What?

32:11.550 --> 32:12.950
I'll give you the money.

32:14.010 --> 32:16.620
You're, you're gonna
give me the money?

32:16.620 --> 32:18.850
I'll give you
the startup funds, yes.

32:18.850 --> 32:21.820
How much can it cost?
250, 300 grand?

32:23.060 --> 32:24.890
I need 60,000 dollars.

32:27.230 --> 32:31.660
You only need 60 grand
to start a business in America?

32:31.670 --> 32:34.630
What a fucking great country
this is, huh?

32:34.640 --> 32:36.000
All right, I'm gonna
get you the money.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.770
We're gonna go talk to her,
tell her all about it,

32:37.770 --> 32:39.810
we're gonna clean
this whole mess up today.

32:39.810 --> 32:44.240
We can't go see her today.
I mean, I need to make sure
the business is up and running,

32:44.250 --> 32:45.850
- and then...
- No.

32:45.850 --> 32:49.050
No. We're doing it today.
We're doing it now.

32:49.050 --> 32:51.750
I'm not letting
your one true love get away.

32:51.750 --> 32:54.820
We are going
to her house right now.

32:54.820 --> 32:58.120
I'm not letting you make
the same mistakes I've made.

32:58.130 --> 33:00.830
I'm gonna get this done
if it's the last thing I do.

33:03.530 --> 33:05.060
Why are you being
so nice to me, Hank?

33:09.940 --> 33:13.370
Love is the most important thing
in the world, man.

33:13.380 --> 33:15.010
It's what everything is about.

33:15.880 --> 33:19.010
Without love,
you got nothing. Zero.

33:20.080 --> 33:22.020
I'm not letting
you disappear, Kev.

33:22.980 --> 33:24.020
Come on.

33:26.950 --> 33:28.960
- Really?
- Hello darling.

33:28.960 --> 33:30.790
Can I borrow a pen, please?

33:30.790 --> 33:34.260
This is my only pen.
I need it for my charts.

33:35.500 --> 33:37.230
I'm good for it.
I cross my heart.

33:37.660 --> 33:39.370
Thank you.

33:39.370 --> 33:41.170
Let's see that arm.

33:41.170 --> 33:42.700
Uh, 60, right?

33:42.700 --> 33:45.070
- Yeah.
- Okay.

33:45.070 --> 33:48.010
Let's make it 80.
What's the date today?

33:48.580 --> 33:50.010
The 31st.

33:50.010 --> 33:51.380
31st.

33:52.580 --> 33:54.110
- Hank?
- There we are.

33:54.550 --> 33:55.920
Yeah.

33:55.920 --> 33:58.850
I don't... I don't know
what to say.

33:58.850 --> 34:01.790
Just get the girl back.
Then we're all square.

34:02.590 --> 34:04.060
I'll see you outside.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.730
So, how did you get into
this line of work?

34:11.929 --> 34:13.900
My momma was a drug addict.

34:13.900 --> 34:16.040
She introduced me to it.

34:16.040 --> 34:18.270
My daddy skipped out on us
when I was 12.

34:20.070 --> 34:22.040
I'm fucking with you.

34:22.510 --> 34:24.340
I like sex.

34:24.350 --> 34:27.710
I pretty much fuck everyone I go
on a date with anyway

34:27.719 --> 34:30.350
so I thought
I might as well
get paid for it.

34:30.350 --> 34:32.989
- Isn't it dangerous?
- No.

34:32.989 --> 34:35.190
- What if you don't wanna do it?
- I don't do it.

34:35.190 --> 34:37.520
- Isn't it degrading? I mean...
- Here's the deal.

34:37.530 --> 34:40.690
Sandy's gonna stay with Carl.
I've given her combat pay.

34:40.699 --> 34:43.159
So she's gonna get him up
and moving out.

34:44.199 --> 34:45.969
I feel fantastic.

34:47.300 --> 34:49.500
Okay. Pop the trunk,
I'm gonna change.

34:51.540 --> 34:52.969
Thank you, Zade.

34:53.909 --> 34:55.370
<i>Always gotta be prepared.</i>

35:05.020 --> 35:08.960
Okay. So, let's focus.
Where do we find this Angie?

35:08.960 --> 35:10.990
Well, I can't just show up
at her work.

35:11.530 --> 35:13.390
Why not? What does she do?

35:13.390 --> 35:14.690
Well, she's a school teacher.

35:14.700 --> 35:17.730
Of course, she is.
I love teachers.

35:17.730 --> 35:20.200
What does she teach?
Reading? Math?

35:20.530 --> 35:21.930
P.E.

35:21.940 --> 35:26.010
-She doesn't teach trampolining
by any chance?
-No.

35:26.010 --> 35:28.840
I mean, she does
but that's not all she does.

35:28.840 --> 35:30.480
- I mean, she...
- I love this.

35:30.480 --> 35:33.050
We're gonna go to the school.
She'll be getting off soon.

35:33.050 --> 35:35.620
You're gonna
tell her you're sorry
in front of the kids.

35:35.620 --> 35:37.220
It'll be like
in all those films.

35:37.220 --> 35:39.290
Then the kids will
tell her to kiss you.

35:39.290 --> 35:41.250
It'll be great.

35:41.260 --> 35:43.260
I don't think we should go
anywhere near her work.

35:44.660 --> 35:46.390
Do you want the 80 grand or not?

35:54.600 --> 35:56.300
Oh, boy.

36:00.140 --> 36:01.840
Okay.

36:01.840 --> 36:04.910
You're gonna go in there,
you're gonna tell her
you're a big success now,

36:04.910 --> 36:06.410
and that you want her back.

36:07.650 --> 36:11.080
And why is she gonna believe
that I'm some big success now?

36:11.090 --> 36:12.920
Because you got my IOU.

36:12.920 --> 36:16.960
- Yeah, written on my arm.
- It sure is.

36:17.890 --> 36:20.560
Okay. Then I'll take a photo.

36:20.560 --> 36:24.060
I'll take a picture of your arm
and it'll act a legal note.

36:24.070 --> 36:26.100
Why don't you just
write him a check?

36:28.640 --> 36:31.000
Yep, okay.
What's your name, Kevin?

36:31.010 --> 36:34.210
Uh, MacDonald. M-A-C, MacDonald.

36:36.080 --> 36:38.510
All right. We're gonna
wait for you here.

36:40.480 --> 36:42.550
This is a bad idea.

36:42.550 --> 36:45.520
-I mean...
-First of all,
it's not a bad idea.

36:45.520 --> 36:47.290
Okay? And frankly,

36:47.290 --> 36:50.560
personally, I'm insulted
with your negativity.

36:50.560 --> 36:52.060
You've gotta show this woman

36:52.060 --> 36:53.990
that you're invested
in her, man.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.330
You can't just send her
a fucking email.

36:56.330 --> 36:59.800
You gotta do something dramatic,
that's romantic.

36:59.800 --> 37:00.930
Yeah, but...

37:01.740 --> 37:03.270
it's just not normal.

37:04.910 --> 37:07.770
Well, let me tell you something,
Kevin MacDonald.

37:07.780 --> 37:10.110
All grand passions are abnormal.

37:12.510 --> 37:14.110
That's what makes them grand.

37:16.480 --> 37:17.650
Go get 'em, kid.

37:19.190 --> 37:20.650
Here goes nothing.

37:23.760 --> 37:25.260
Hey, should we go with him?

37:31.900 --> 37:33.500
Man, I hated school.

37:34.030 --> 37:36.600
- Me too.
- I loved it.

37:36.600 --> 37:38.140
Best time of my life.

37:38.940 --> 37:40.540
Being a kid.

37:43.650 --> 37:47.410
Is this whole trampolining thing
a ploy to get her back?

37:48.320 --> 37:49.850
No.

37:49.850 --> 37:52.350
-You know she didn't leave you
because of the blowjob.
-Shh, come on.

37:52.350 --> 37:54.020
No, but she did.

37:54.020 --> 37:56.720
No. No one ever
leaves someone
because of sex.

37:56.720 --> 37:59.660
What are you talking about?
People leave each other
all the time because of affairs.

37:59.660 --> 38:02.960
They don't. They leave
because they don't
love each other enough.

38:02.960 --> 38:05.030
And that's why
the affair happens.

38:07.100 --> 38:09.600
Well, I love Angie. Always have.

38:09.600 --> 38:12.740
- Not enough. You wouldn't have
gotten a blowjob if you did.

38:12.740 --> 38:14.370
Here we go, game time.

38:14.380 --> 38:16.140
Can I help you?

38:16.140 --> 38:18.810
Uh, yeah. We're here to see
Angie Cooper.

38:18.810 --> 38:20.080
And who are you?

38:20.080 --> 38:22.080
I'm just a friend,
an old friend of hers.

38:22.080 --> 38:23.320
And who are you two?

38:24.150 --> 38:26.320
We're new friends.

38:26.320 --> 38:29.990
I remember
the chairs being bigger.
Does everyone say that?

38:31.490 --> 38:35.090
Miss Cooper isn't in today,
she's ill.

38:35.100 --> 38:36.930
Oh, god. What's wrong with her?

38:36.930 --> 38:39.470
Well, I can't divulge
personal information.

38:39.470 --> 38:41.370
I'd be happy
to send her a message.

38:41.370 --> 38:43.070
Great, yeah. If you could
just tell her that Kevin...

38:43.070 --> 38:45.540
No, no, that's fine.
Uh, I'll call her.

38:45.540 --> 38:47.210
- Mmhmm.
- Thanks.

38:48.510 --> 38:49.280
Lame.

38:49.280 --> 38:51.140
- Lovely school.
- Thank you.

38:52.750 --> 38:57.650
<i>♪ I've got it made
I've got 'em bayin ♪</i>

38:57.650 --> 38:59.790
We're gonna spread out.

38:59.790 --> 39:02.660
She's sick, so she's vulnerable.

39:02.660 --> 39:05.520
We need to put together
a care package that says
"I love you,"

39:05.530 --> 39:09.200
that says "I'm gonna
look after you forever."

39:09.200 --> 39:13.700
I'll take aisles one and two,
Kevin, three and four,
Zade, five and six.

39:16.800 --> 39:18.100
How long have you known him?

39:19.810 --> 39:21.810
Nine hours, give or take.

39:27.310 --> 39:29.150
You think this is
a good idea?

39:29.150 --> 39:31.920
Wouldn't you think it was weird
if your ex showed up
at your house

39:31.920 --> 39:34.520
with a stranger and a pros...

39:35.590 --> 39:37.760
Another lady?

39:39.330 --> 39:41.460
I'd probably find that weird.

39:41.460 --> 39:43.660
But that's also why I like it.

39:44.430 --> 39:45.660
You'd like it?

39:45.670 --> 39:47.200
Why not? Shows imagination.

39:47.200 --> 39:49.500
Maybe but Angie's not like you.

39:49.500 --> 39:51.670
How is she different?

39:51.670 --> 39:54.840
I don't know. She just doesn't
talk about sex all the time.

39:57.280 --> 40:01.250
I get it. Holy shit.
You're a fucking prude.

40:02.550 --> 40:04.220
- I'm not a prude.
- Then why do you squirm

40:04.220 --> 40:06.620
at any mention
of anything sexual?

40:06.850 --> 40:08.090
Prudish.

40:08.090 --> 40:11.020
Not prudish. I am not prudish.
Not at all.

40:11.030 --> 40:12.430
Then prove it.

40:12.430 --> 40:15.860
What are three words
that when put together
get nasty?

40:16.560 --> 40:17.800
I'm not doing this.

40:18.730 --> 40:22.230
Puny. Blood. Fuck.

40:22.240 --> 40:25.540
- Would you stop?
- Aw, you can't think of any?

40:25.540 --> 40:28.310
- Three words.
- I'm not playing, Zade.

40:29.210 --> 40:31.540
You are not very mad at me,
are you, Kev?

40:33.880 --> 40:36.780
- Smelly poop truck.
- That's it!

40:36.780 --> 40:38.880
Three more, disgust me.

40:40.950 --> 40:42.520
You know, you're really smart,

40:42.920 --> 40:44.220
and really pretty,

40:45.030 --> 40:46.490
you don't have
to be so aggressive.

40:49.030 --> 40:50.430
Ever raise your voice, Kevvo?

40:50.430 --> 40:54.170
Ever get mad and just let rip?

40:54.770 --> 40:57.540
Anal, lick, prolapse.

40:57.540 --> 40:58.970
Baggy, vag, mouse!

40:58.970 --> 41:00.610
Oh!

41:00.610 --> 41:03.280
I'm really sorry,
I was just making a joke.

41:03.740 --> 41:05.240
Well, what was the joke?

41:06.450 --> 41:07.610
Excuse me?

41:07.620 --> 41:09.880
I didn't hear it.
What was the joke?

41:12.250 --> 41:14.550
- Knock Knock.
- Who's there?

41:14.560 --> 41:15.920
Isabel.

41:15.920 --> 41:17.160
Isabel who?

41:17.160 --> 41:19.830
Isabel necessary
on that bicycle?

41:21.060 --> 41:23.530
Shit, I'm sorry I even asked.

41:27.770 --> 41:29.300
I thought that was funny.

41:41.310 --> 41:43.750
We totally fell apart
back there.

41:43.750 --> 41:46.790
- I did not!
- No, you did.

41:46.790 --> 41:48.850
Like a little girl.

41:48.860 --> 41:51.660
And that isn't
technically a word by the way.

41:51.660 --> 41:54.060
Well, you're not
technically a businessman.

41:54.060 --> 41:56.400
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

41:56.400 --> 41:59.230
Look at you, you look
like a guy who cleans a pool.

42:00.100 --> 42:01.870
- Ew?
- She's right.

42:01.870 --> 42:03.340
We gotta get you looking sharp.

42:03.340 --> 42:05.640
Like Angie's idea
of an entrepreneur.

42:06.240 --> 42:07.770
Let's go shopping.

42:07.780 --> 42:08.940
Come on.

42:11.750 --> 42:13.880
I'm doing this for you, Kev,
come on!

42:18.920 --> 42:22.990
Is it true
what they say about guys
with medium-sized feet?

42:24.160 --> 42:26.290
Zade, pick out a pair
if you want.

42:26.290 --> 42:28.460
No, thanks. Not really my style.

42:28.460 --> 42:30.760
Should I have
gotten Carl a suit?

42:30.770 --> 42:33.470
You know what,
I haven't heard from Sandy.

42:34.870 --> 42:37.300
All right,
so when she opens the door,
what should I say again?

42:39.640 --> 42:41.840
You're telling her
that you've succeeded.

42:41.840 --> 42:44.810
Okay? You're gonna
show her the check,
and that you're sorry.

42:46.150 --> 42:48.750
That's... that's too strange.

42:50.120 --> 42:52.950
All right. Tell her
that without her...

42:53.820 --> 42:55.250
you're nothing but a shadow.

42:55.990 --> 42:57.020
Tell her that...

42:57.860 --> 42:58.890
your heart...

42:59.460 --> 43:02.430
is like a mold hedgehog...

43:02.430 --> 43:05.000
smashed up against the blades
of a lawnmower.

43:06.370 --> 43:08.400
Zade, what do you think
I should say?

43:11.040 --> 43:12.940
Tell her you want
to much her pussy.

43:16.210 --> 43:17.810
- How's that fit?
- Oh...

43:18.780 --> 43:20.080
It's a bit roomy.

43:20.080 --> 43:22.880
Hey Zade, keep trying Sandy,
will you?

43:22.880 --> 43:26.050
Hank, you need
a new phone.

43:26.050 --> 43:30.690
Yeah, I'd go down half a size,
Kev, I mean, it all depends
on the choice of sock.

43:30.690 --> 43:32.860
Yeah, I'll go down
half a size.

43:32.860 --> 43:33.960
I agree. Here.

43:35.260 --> 43:37.360
What would you say?
Seriously, Zade.

43:38.330 --> 43:41.100
Maybe don't talk about yourself
so much.

43:41.100 --> 43:43.500
Tell her
that she's your miracle,

43:43.500 --> 43:47.070
that without her
your life means nothing.

43:47.070 --> 43:51.480
Tell her that she's
more beautiful than
a full moon in Montana

43:51.480 --> 43:53.750
or the poetry of Rumi,

43:53.750 --> 43:58.850
or any other beautiful thing
that man or nature has yet made.

43:58.850 --> 44:05.160
Tell her that she's a genius
of Einstein-Ian proportions.

44:05.160 --> 44:07.060
And that she's sexy,

44:07.060 --> 44:08.630
and does sexy well.

44:09.560 --> 44:14.330
And that you really, really,
really love her.

44:20.270 --> 44:23.980
Wow. Say, that was really...
it was really good.

44:23.980 --> 44:25.540
That's an handsome fit, sir.

44:26.310 --> 44:27.750
Great, we'll take 'em.

44:32.950 --> 44:34.020
Let's run for it.

44:34.550 --> 44:36.060
Stop! Wait!

44:37.420 --> 44:39.590
Come on, people! Come on!

44:44.960 --> 44:46.030
We got this.

45:21.700 --> 45:23.840
It wasn't the clerk's fault.

45:23.840 --> 45:26.410
Those plastic tags are
a nuisance.

45:28.640 --> 45:30.910
But a straight razor gives us
a concealed weapon.

45:31.810 --> 45:34.580
I have a collection.
That's an antique.

45:34.580 --> 45:36.520
That doesn't mean
that you can carry it.

45:36.520 --> 45:38.650
I sincerely apologize, Officers.

45:38.650 --> 45:41.090
Look, you have to understand
where we're coming from.

45:41.090 --> 45:44.590
You were running through a place
of business with a weapon.

45:44.590 --> 45:46.660
It was all part
of a romantic gesture.

45:46.660 --> 45:49.260
My... my friend here lost
his true love.

45:49.260 --> 45:52.770
We're giving him a makeover.
He's gonna win her back.

45:52.770 --> 45:54.070
Come on, guys.

45:56.740 --> 45:59.670
I'm not against
romantic gestures per Se.

45:59.670 --> 46:01.910
It's true. He's not.

46:01.910 --> 46:04.780
Officer, it was
a misunderstanding, come on.

46:07.580 --> 46:09.920
I'm moved by your argument.

46:09.920 --> 46:12.480
So I'm gonna let you go
with a warning.

46:12.490 --> 46:13.990
But we're gonna keep the razor.

46:14.450 --> 46:16.120
Thank you, Officers.

46:16.120 --> 46:18.520
Give love, get love, sir.

46:18.530 --> 46:19.930
Can I give you a hug?

46:28.130 --> 46:29.900
Now that's unfortunate.

46:43.220 --> 46:45.350
I can't believe
they couldn't look
the other way.

46:45.350 --> 46:47.620
Drugs are drugs,
they couldn't have looked
the other way.

46:47.620 --> 46:50.120
You're
such a fucking prude.

46:50.120 --> 46:51.420
Where are we going?

46:51.430 --> 46:53.360
I need shoes.

46:53.360 --> 46:54.960
Hang out in the car.

46:54.960 --> 46:56.200
Where are we?

46:56.200 --> 46:57.900
Look, wait in the car.
I'll be back in a minute.

46:59.270 --> 47:00.270
Zade?

47:01.230 --> 47:02.470
Is this your brothel?

47:02.470 --> 47:04.270
No-one says brothel.

47:12.810 --> 47:14.850
Jesus, Zade.
What the hell
are you doing?

47:21.420 --> 47:22.750
You fucker.

47:29.200 --> 47:30.530
Come on, Zade.

47:37.640 --> 47:39.170
Jesus, they're all at it.

47:43.040 --> 47:44.110
What the fuck!

47:46.080 --> 47:47.010
Fuck it.

48:27.290 --> 48:28.720
Where are you, Zade?

48:31.190 --> 48:32.320
May I help you?

48:32.330 --> 48:33.730
No, no.

48:35.500 --> 48:36.760
I'm here to see Zade.

48:37.430 --> 48:39.870
- Zade?
- Yeah. Zade. Uh...

48:40.400 --> 48:42.030
I think she works here.

48:42.040 --> 48:43.240
Well, that's funny

48:43.240 --> 48:46.570
'cause it's just my family
as far as I know

48:46.570 --> 48:49.140
and, well, some might
call that work, I...

48:49.140 --> 48:50.610
Sorry, um...

48:51.510 --> 48:52.840
Must be the wrong address.

48:53.450 --> 48:54.710
Kev?

48:55.550 --> 48:57.720
I told you to wait in the car.

48:57.720 --> 48:59.020
I'll be down in a minute.

49:02.320 --> 49:04.190
I think you should come in.

49:12.500 --> 49:18.570
Okay. Lemon juice,
sugar and water.

49:18.570 --> 49:21.040
Tell me if it needs
anything else.

49:22.480 --> 49:24.680
And how exactly
do you know Millie?

49:26.350 --> 49:27.280
Millie?

49:28.250 --> 49:30.780
Uh, Millicent, my daughter.

49:32.020 --> 49:33.420
Oh. Um...

49:33.420 --> 49:35.120
We met through a mutual friend.

49:35.120 --> 49:38.120
- Mutual friend.
- Uh, work friend, really.

49:38.130 --> 49:42.290
Kevin,
are you a rider, too?

49:42.860 --> 49:43.800
No.

49:44.760 --> 49:47.030
Well, what is it exactly
that you do?

49:48.270 --> 49:49.570
I'm in construction.

49:49.570 --> 49:53.170
Mmm. My daughter knows people
in construction?

49:53.170 --> 49:56.740
Well, a mutual friend
through party and then,

49:56.740 --> 49:59.440
and Millie was there.

49:59.450 --> 50:00.950
Was Monique there?

50:01.280 --> 50:02.310
No.

50:03.220 --> 50:08.150
Monique is a friend of Millie's.
Great tits.

50:08.160 --> 50:11.960
She used to come over
and do backstrokes in our pool
every afternoon.

50:11.960 --> 50:14.230
What a lovely way
to spend an hour.

50:14.230 --> 50:18.230
Watching her tits go up
and down the pool.

50:18.930 --> 50:21.970
Up and down, and flopping down.

50:23.140 --> 50:26.370
I'm actually getting out
of construction. Uh...

50:26.370 --> 50:27.740
Gonna start my own business.

50:27.740 --> 50:29.310
I'm gonna call it
"Trampoline World."

50:29.310 --> 50:32.580
It's gonna be
this amusement park
in the warehouse district.

50:32.580 --> 50:35.250
We're gonna have
Sky Slam basketball,

50:35.250 --> 50:36.880
uh, foam pits.

50:36.880 --> 50:39.820
-We actually have a lot of...
-Kevin, there's nothing wrong
with construction.

50:40.420 --> 50:41.720
We should split.

50:41.720 --> 50:43.320
If you'd like
I could send you
some literature.

50:43.320 --> 50:46.360
Trampolining is one
of the fastest growing sports
in America.

50:46.360 --> 50:49.590
It actually just got featured
in Delta's <i>Sky</i> magazine.

50:49.600 --> 50:51.630
Our friend's been arrested,
we should go.

50:51.630 --> 50:54.030
- Arrested, for what?
- Drugs.

50:54.030 --> 50:57.800
Millie has
such colorful friends.

50:57.810 --> 50:59.740
What's Monique doing these days?

50:59.740 --> 51:01.070
Okay, let's go.

51:01.080 --> 51:05.010
Thank you for the lemon stuff.

51:07.410 --> 51:09.550
- Shut up.
- I didn't say anything.

51:09.550 --> 51:11.880
- You were thinking it.
- Nope.

51:11.890 --> 51:16.620
I'm not a liar, I just
don't feel the need to tell
everyone everything.

51:16.620 --> 51:18.060
Okay.

51:18.060 --> 51:20.290
- Don't judge me.
- I'm not.

51:21.730 --> 51:22.930
You have
a beautiful home.

51:26.300 --> 51:27.500
It's really nice.

51:32.270 --> 51:35.110
You really shouldn't be
doing this, you know?

51:35.110 --> 51:38.280
I mean, any guy
with half a brain
would call you back.

51:39.180 --> 51:41.150
You could have,
like a really great job.

51:41.810 --> 51:43.150
I have a job.

51:43.980 --> 51:46.250
Yeah, but it's... it's dirty.

51:47.690 --> 51:49.320
It's not like you need
the money.

51:51.060 --> 51:53.660
Are you fucking kidding me?

51:53.660 --> 51:55.960
- What?
- You are judging me, asshole!

51:55.960 --> 51:58.900
The only reason you're
going through with any of this
is because of that check.

51:58.900 --> 52:03.240
Oh, and who is it that charges
a thousand dollars an hour
for their company?

52:03.240 --> 52:04.700
Parasites!

52:04.710 --> 52:06.740
Yeah, well, at least I'm not
pretending to be something
I'm not.

52:06.740 --> 52:10.040
Pretending to be some kind
of hooker or something,
it's rude to hookers.

52:10.040 --> 52:11.910
People don't work at McDonalds

52:11.910 --> 52:13.910
because they like it,
it's a job!

52:13.910 --> 52:16.550
-Your slumming
in it is bullshit.
-Fuck you.

52:18.080 --> 52:19.150
Tourist.

52:20.490 --> 52:22.850
I'm going to get Hank,
I'm driving him home,

52:22.860 --> 52:25.560
and then this whole
fucking shit is over.

52:29.200 --> 52:32.200
<i>♪ Nobody knows</i>

52:32.200 --> 52:34.370
<i>♪ The trouble I've seen</i>

52:34.370 --> 52:35.830
- Let's try that one more time.
-  -Okay.

52:35.840 --> 52:38.240
No! Okay.
One, two, three, four.

52:38.240 --> 52:43.380
<i>♪ Nobody knows</i>
<i>The trouble I've seen ♪</i>

52:43.380 --> 52:46.210
Fuck, we're good at this, man.
We should take this on the road.

52:46.210 --> 52:48.110
- You and me.
- Enough of this shit.

52:51.180 --> 52:56.820
Hey, isn't there something
we could do to expedite this?

52:56.820 --> 52:58.890
And who might you be?

52:59.730 --> 53:02.590
Um, I was hired by him.

53:05.700 --> 53:06.970
Lawyer?

53:06.970 --> 53:09.500
No. Personal adviser.

53:09.500 --> 53:13.410
Well, you need a lawyer
to be your personal adviser
in here.

53:13.410 --> 53:16.640
Why don't you take a seat,
and then the judge will see him
in an hour or so?

53:17.580 --> 53:18.580
Keep smiling.

53:21.650 --> 53:25.180
<i>No physical body contact</i>
<i>beyond initial</i>

53:25.190 --> 53:27.820
<i>and supporting embrace
will be tolerated,</i>

53:27.820 --> 53:30.490
and will result in termination
of the visit.

53:39.030 --> 53:40.200
You like barbecue?

53:41.130 --> 53:43.700
Might as well talk
since we're stuck here.

53:43.700 --> 53:44.940
My name's Sonny.

53:45.640 --> 53:47.470
I'm Zade.

53:47.470 --> 53:51.140
Hey man, why don't you just
give her a break, okay?
She's had a tough day.

53:51.910 --> 53:53.410
Zade, why not come sit here?

53:55.680 --> 53:57.350
I'm fine, thank you.

53:57.980 --> 54:00.690
She's fine, thank you.

54:00.690 --> 54:06.460
So, I got this sauce called
"Smokin but not Broken"

54:06.460 --> 54:08.360
Hey, don't, don't do that.
Don't touch her leg.

54:08.360 --> 54:11.100
It's not okay to touch...
people you don't know.

54:11.100 --> 54:13.500
<i>Occasional hand-holding</i>
<i>is acceptable.</i>

54:13.500 --> 54:17.140
Whoa there, brother. I didn't
even know y'all were together.

54:18.640 --> 54:21.340
We don't have to be together
to care about each other.

54:24.140 --> 54:25.310
I'm waiting in the car.

54:30.250 --> 54:33.250
It's not okay
to touch people
you don't know?

54:35.820 --> 54:37.460
So what kinda stuff
do you write?

54:38.760 --> 54:40.190
Stories.

54:40.990 --> 54:43.460
Short ones mostly.

54:43.460 --> 54:48.330
I'm writing one now
about this woman who is
having an affair with this guy,

54:48.340 --> 54:51.540
and then she finds out
that she is only one of many.

54:51.540 --> 54:54.440
It's called
"The other 'other' woman."

54:57.040 --> 54:58.540
I think you'd be a good writer.

55:00.710 --> 55:02.310
- You do?
- Sure.

55:02.320 --> 55:03.780
Why?

55:03.780 --> 55:04.980
'Cause you take chances,

55:04.990 --> 55:06.750
you say things
other people won't.

55:06.750 --> 55:08.820
You're different.

55:08.820 --> 55:10.490
You should feel good
about who you are.

55:13.960 --> 55:15.330
It's the death of romance.

55:17.530 --> 55:20.600
We're living through the murder
of romance.

55:20.600 --> 55:23.470
- Get it?
- I get you. Yeah.

55:23.470 --> 55:26.940
When you're in love,
people do things
they normally wouldn't.

55:26.940 --> 55:30.080
I was sitting there, imagining
the rest of our lives together.

55:30.080 --> 55:32.740
We get a villa in Italy,

55:32.750 --> 55:36.080
she makes the lunch,
I till the land.

55:37.120 --> 55:40.090
Our kids are running
through the sunflower field.

55:41.950 --> 55:43.520
That's fucking beautiful.

55:43.860 --> 55:44.790
Yeah.

55:48.630 --> 55:50.430
There will be
trampolines everywhere.

55:50.430 --> 55:55.170
People bouncing around,
just good clean American fun,
you know?

55:55.170 --> 55:59.440
You're a very strange person,
Kevin MacDonald.

56:00.510 --> 56:02.510
There is gonna be
a juice bar over there.

56:02.510 --> 56:04.540
A juice bar is not sexy.

56:04.540 --> 56:07.510
-It's not meant to be sexy.
-Well, then people aren't
gonna come.

56:08.210 --> 56:09.780
What are you calling it?

56:11.950 --> 56:13.120
Trampoline World.

56:14.290 --> 56:16.350
No, you're not calling it that.

56:16.360 --> 56:18.160
All right,
what would you call it?

56:18.160 --> 56:20.490
- Call it "Tramps."
- I like it.

56:20.490 --> 56:23.800
Get one of those big,
fluorescent signs.

56:23.800 --> 56:28.730
Maybe a bouncing stiletto,
slowly filling up
with champagne.

56:28.740 --> 56:29.800
- Nice.
- You know?

56:29.800 --> 56:31.270
And light bulbs for bubbles.

56:31.270 --> 56:33.570
You see, you are a good writer.

56:33.570 --> 56:36.270
No, I'm not. I just...

56:36.280 --> 56:38.610
write stuff that happens to me.

56:41.910 --> 56:44.620
So, you're
the "Other 'other' woman"?

56:45.850 --> 56:49.690
Don't look at me
with those sad dog eyes,
I knew what I was doing.

56:51.660 --> 56:53.290
I bet it was real interesting.

56:54.530 --> 56:55.660
How would you know?

56:56.600 --> 56:59.060
Oh, right,
because roofers don't read.

56:59.070 --> 57:02.870
But if I did read,
I'd rather read
about the rich girl who lies

57:02.870 --> 57:05.300
than the prostitute.

57:06.140 --> 57:07.810
And prostitutes are sad.

57:08.970 --> 57:11.080
You're rude,

57:11.080 --> 57:13.010
and angry,

57:13.010 --> 57:16.180
and... really, really spoiled

57:16.180 --> 57:19.180
but... you're not sad.

57:21.820 --> 57:24.890
And you're narcissistic,

57:24.890 --> 57:26.360
and indulgent,

57:28.230 --> 57:29.790
but you're not stupid.

57:31.660 --> 57:32.600
Thank you.

57:36.170 --> 57:37.300
What is that?

57:38.540 --> 57:40.040
A harmonica.

57:40.040 --> 57:41.940
- Really?
- Mmm.

57:41.940 --> 57:43.310
But it's so small.

57:44.110 --> 57:46.410
- Does it play?
- Yeah, it does.

57:49.450 --> 57:50.450
Wow.

57:53.050 --> 57:56.290
We should probably go hang.

57:56.860 --> 57:57.790
Okay.

58:02.730 --> 58:04.430
Anybody got the time over there?

58:05.430 --> 58:07.970
You working up there?

58:20.910 --> 58:21.910
So...

58:22.980 --> 58:24.650
What's a prolapse?

58:28.420 --> 58:31.620
It's when either your anus

58:31.630 --> 58:36.530
or your vagina are pushed
inside out of your body.

58:39.870 --> 58:40.970
That's a good word.

58:50.480 --> 58:51.610
Sorry.

58:56.680 --> 59:00.890
I never had any kids.
I always wanted 'em though.

59:00.890 --> 59:03.390
- How come?
- Ah, she wanted to wait.

59:03.820 --> 59:05.820
How dumb am I, huh?

59:05.830 --> 59:08.990
You know, I was never once
unfaithful to her. Not once.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.330
Nah, I loved her wholly,

59:12.330 --> 59:14.870
unabashedly from
the first day
I met her.

59:17.840 --> 59:19.270
She was my everything.

59:20.840 --> 59:22.570
Did she find someone else?

59:22.580 --> 59:24.380
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

59:25.280 --> 59:27.210
She said I was
an emotional cripple.

59:27.210 --> 59:30.550
That she couldn't remember
what she loved about me
in the first place.

59:30.550 --> 59:33.950
People make out like women are
the romantics but it's not true.

59:33.950 --> 59:37.420
We're the knights,
the last of the noble breed.

59:39.160 --> 59:40.690
I'm gonna die today.

59:43.630 --> 59:44.660
Who's after you?

59:46.670 --> 59:47.600
No one.

59:50.340 --> 59:54.870
Well, you let me know...
if somebody's after you,
because I got a guy for that.

59:59.210 --> 01:00:01.380
Well, looks
like I'm sprung, kid.

01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:04.280
Good luck to you.

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:05.650
Keep it in your pants.

01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:09.690
Thank you, sir.

01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:12.090
<i>Mes ami, superb.</i>

01:00:12.090 --> 01:00:13.960
<i>Salut Monsieur.</i>

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:15.630
The happy band are
back together.

01:00:16.330 --> 01:00:17.630
Was it terrible in jail?

01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:20.030
Ah, it was okay.
I met a nice kid.

01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:22.400
Oh, yeah? What was he in for?

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:24.940
He masturbated
on some girl in a bus.

01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:26.870
Jesus.

01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:28.640
Yeah, he got carried away.

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:31.680
I'd rather someone could come
on me than a booger.

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:34.950
-What?
-It's sterile. It's straight
from the testes.

01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:36.350
Booger is a waste.

01:00:36.350 --> 01:00:38.350
I bet you think
a blowjob is fine

01:00:38.350 --> 01:00:40.620
but you wouldn't blow your nose
in a girl's mouth.

01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:43.960
Enough! Let's go
find this Annie.

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:46.120
Let's just go home, Hank.
I think we're done for the day...

01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:48.130
No. No way. I'm not
giving up now.

01:00:48.130 --> 01:00:49.660
Hank, I... I really don't mind.

01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:52.400
Well, I do mind.
I just wasted
half my day in jail.

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:53.670
I'm finding Annie.

01:00:54.130 --> 01:00:55.500
It's Angie.

01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:57.870
It doesn't matter
what her name is.
I'm finding her.

01:00:57.870 --> 01:00:59.540
Maybe we could just take
like small break.

01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:03.240
No. Look, something's gotta
work here, okay?

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:05.980
I mean, love...
it has to mean something.

01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:07.780
I need to know

01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:11.550
that in this world it's not just
pure, disappointing shit.

01:01:11.550 --> 01:01:13.180
And I don't care
what you two do,

01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:14.450
but I'm going to Annie's.

01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:16.020
I got a plan.

01:01:19.730 --> 01:01:20.730
<i>Andale.</i>

01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:31.000
Just up here
on the left.

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:34.440
Maybe we should just ring
the doorbell.

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:36.540
You said she won't talk to you.

01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:39.240
- So, what are we doing here?
- Waiting?

01:01:39.250 --> 01:01:42.210
- For what?
- For someone to let us in.

01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:44.020
Burglars don't have balloons.

01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:49.550
I gotta piss. Hold on
to these, will you?

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:51.390
What...

01:01:52.890 --> 01:01:54.690
This is a bad idea.

01:01:54.690 --> 01:01:56.890
- Why?
- You don't even like her.

01:01:56.900 --> 01:01:59.000
You're just caught up
in the obsession.

01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:04.740
You think you're in love
but it's just this stab
of rejection.

01:02:06.610 --> 01:02:08.410
Do you wanna be with her?

01:02:09.010 --> 01:02:10.540
Really, with her?

01:02:19.250 --> 01:02:20.420
I'm going in.

01:02:21.650 --> 01:02:23.650
Why? What's so great about her?

01:02:26.730 --> 01:02:28.490
You don't have anything to say?

01:02:30.130 --> 01:02:31.100
Okay.

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:33.100
Well, good luck with that.

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:40.400
See? Magic.

01:02:40.410 --> 01:02:43.440
- Well, hello there.
How are you?
- Oh, is it my birthday?

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:45.180
It is, happy birthday, darling.

01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:47.850
Hey, I don't think
I want the balloons.

01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:50.750
Lose 'em. Come on.

01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:54.520
Is that it?

01:02:55.690 --> 01:02:57.220
- Well, go and knock then.
- I know.

01:02:58.220 --> 01:02:59.760
You got this.

01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:01.630
Be firm.

01:03:02.490 --> 01:03:03.800
Be aggressive, Kev.

01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:10.400
Angie.

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:12.840
Oh.

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:15.440
- What are you doing here?
- Okay, listen.

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:19.410
I've come to tell you
that I think that you're,
you're like sunsets

01:03:19.410 --> 01:03:20.710
- in Montana.
- Oh, god.

01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:22.310
- You're like...
- Kevin...

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:24.580
- No, just hear me out, okay?
- Who is that?

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:27.520
I'm no one.

01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:29.620
I'm proud of you.

01:03:31.290 --> 01:03:33.860
You're like the poetry or Rumi,

01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:35.760
and, and, you have
Einstein-Ian proportions,

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:39.030
and I like, I like
spending time with you.

01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:42.700
- And I treasure you, and...
- Hey, Angie. Uh...

01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:46.040
Five letter word,
starts with an 'L'
insect Steve...

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:47.510
Sounds like Steve.

01:03:50.810 --> 01:03:51.780
Is that...

01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:57.720
Steve.

01:03:59.150 --> 01:04:00.280
What are you doing here, Steve?

01:04:02.350 --> 01:04:03.890
Crossword.

01:04:03.890 --> 01:04:05.260
What are you doing here, Steve?

01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:06.660
What are you doing here?

01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:08.460
- What are you doing here, Steve?
- Well, she called me, and...

01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:11.060
- She needs some help with her...
- Just tell him.

01:04:11.930 --> 01:04:13.360
Listen.

01:04:13.370 --> 01:04:14.700
It just happened, Kev.

01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:16.030
You're sleeping with her?

01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:19.870
-This is just
a misunderstanding...
-Yeah, he is.

01:04:20.370 --> 01:04:21.470
We're in love.

01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:23.310
- Oh, you're in love with her?
- No!

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:26.240
We made some bad decisions and...

01:04:26.250 --> 01:04:27.310
Why didn't you tell me?

01:04:27.310 --> 01:04:29.010
Listen, we didn't want
to hurt you.

01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:32.980
You said she wasn't good enough
for me.

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:37.190
And you're right.

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:41.890
You're right. And you,

01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:43.690
I didn't mean all that shit
about Montana.

01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:45.560
Okay? Someone told me
to say that.

01:04:45.570 --> 01:04:49.700
And, uh... I got a blowjob
from that stripper because
I didn't love you enough.

01:05:06.350 --> 01:05:07.620
Fuck!

01:05:12.290 --> 01:05:13.460
Stupid.

01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:17.700
- Give me the keys.
- Bro, I'm so sorry.

01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:20.600
Listen, I'm gonna find you
the money for Trampoline World,
all right?

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:24.100
- I think it's a fucking great...
- Just give me the fucking keys.

01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:28.470
Here.

01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:31.040
You can never be a part
of Trampoline World.

01:05:46.290 --> 01:05:49.430
<i>Hello. Bet you didn't think
you'd hear from me today.</i>

01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:53.930
<i>I'm sorry, I don't know</i>
<i>what to say. I just...</i>
<i>I miss you.</i>

01:05:53.930 --> 01:05:55.930
<i>And I want you to know
that you were right</i>

01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:58.300
<i>about me being
in a wheelchair emotionally.</i>

01:06:06.610 --> 01:06:09.050
<i>I've learned now that...</i>

01:06:09.050 --> 01:06:11.080
<i>I wasn't good enough
for you, Karen.</i>

01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:15.790
<i>And I'm not even good enough
for this world anymore.</i>

01:06:15.790 --> 01:06:18.920
<i>Don't go
into the red room, okay?</i>

01:06:18.930 --> 01:06:20.830
<i>I keep all my records
in the bureau</i>

01:06:20.830 --> 01:06:22.890
<i>so that you can have
everything that you want.</i>

01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:26.200
<i>Take anything.
Leave what you don't want.</i>

01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:34.710
- Uh, Hank's phone?
- Hi, it's me.

01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:36.970
I am a giant asshole.

01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:39.710
All right? I made
a huge mistake, and I'd...

01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:41.750
<i>- like to take it all back.
- Is Hank with you?</i>

01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:46.850
I realize now that you are
more interesting than anything
in Montana.

01:06:46.850 --> 01:06:49.420
And that any movie
or any poetry written...

01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:51.220
Just shut up! Where's Hank?

01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:54.360
- What?
<i>- Something's wrong with Hank.</i>

01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:55.830
What's wrong with Hank?

01:06:55.830 --> 01:06:58.360
<i>You have to find him, Kevin.
He's gonna kill himself.</i>

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.300
<i>What?</i>

01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:02.730
I found a video on his phone.
He's gonna do it. Now. Today.

01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:06.300
What? That doesn't make
any sense. He was happy
when we left. He...

01:07:06.310 --> 01:07:07.940
<i>He thinks Angie
and I got back together.</i>

01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:09.970
That's worse.
That's what he wanted.

01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:12.810
<i>Go to the red room. He said
not to go into the red room.</i>

01:07:20.190 --> 01:07:21.220
Hank!

01:07:29.290 --> 01:07:30.230
Hank?

01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:33.300
Oh, my God, Hank!

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:39.240
Where is Hank?

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:43.770
Carl, he might hurt himself,
okay? I need to know
where he is.

01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:44.780
He's taking a nap.

01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:46.680
Just like everybody else!

01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:48.010
Just tell me where he is!

01:07:48.010 --> 01:07:50.410
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.
Shut up!

01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:53.220
What day is it?

01:07:54.250 --> 01:07:55.190
Friday.

01:07:55.650 --> 01:07:57.150
Oh, no, no, no.

01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:59.920
Oh, no, God. Oh, God.
That can't be good.

01:08:02.490 --> 01:08:04.360
Fuck, Carl! Where's Hank?

01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:07.530
I told you, motherfucker!

01:08:07.530 --> 01:08:09.100
He's taking a nap!

01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:14.370
Hank!

01:08:15.070 --> 01:08:16.010
Hank!

01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:17.779
Hank!

01:08:27.250 --> 01:08:28.250
Hank!

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:30.189
Are you out there?

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:34.960
I'm fine.

01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:38.000
I wanted to get
a little air is all.

01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:40.930
I'm coming up.

01:08:43.170 --> 01:08:44.970
It's a long way down, buddy.

01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:48.170
Hank, I'm a fucking roofer.

01:08:49.109 --> 01:08:50.210
Good point.

01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:54.810
I just... wanna talk.

01:09:00.990 --> 01:09:04.420
It's been a frantic
last few days, Kevin.

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:09.430
I'm not gonna kill myself
if that's what you're thinking.

01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:11.600
That's good.

01:09:12.330 --> 01:09:13.260
I just...

01:09:14.130 --> 01:09:16.470
wanted to hang out for a while.

01:09:16.470 --> 01:09:18.600
You didn't invite me
to this party, remember?

01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:24.310
How did it go with Angie?

01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:28.109
She was having sex
with my brother.

01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:29.880
What?

01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:32.850
That's basically it.

01:09:32.850 --> 01:09:35.149
Jesus.

01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:38.390
God, I am a waste of space, huh?

01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:42.160
And this.

01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:45.529
This pen, remember that?
I stole it from that nice nurse.

01:09:45.529 --> 01:09:47.630
I mean, I am a fucking asshole.

01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:49.800
That's not true.

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:54.370
It is true. I'm a dark hole.
I don't make anyone feel good.

01:09:54.370 --> 01:09:57.470
Hank, you probably just need
some sleep. Why don't you just
come back inside?

01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:03.250
Kevin...

01:10:05.050 --> 01:10:06.520
you're a good guy.

01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:08.820
You are.

01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:10.620
But we're not even
really friends.

01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:13.060
And how sad is that?

01:10:13.990 --> 01:10:16.790
Look who was at my party,
for example.

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:19.160
Got a bunch of guys
I've barely met,

01:10:19.170 --> 01:10:21.570
girls that I've paid for
and Carl.

01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:24.170
Carl, for Christ sakes.

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:27.670
I didn't want this.

01:10:31.810 --> 01:10:33.840
I just wanted to go out quietly,

01:10:33.850 --> 01:10:37.050
have something good happen
before I left.

01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:41.220
Something... Something good
is happening.

01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:43.420
What the fuck are you doing
up there?

01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:45.190
Zade!

01:10:47.590 --> 01:10:49.530
You wanna have sex with me?

01:10:49.530 --> 01:10:51.930
Get the fuck down from there!

01:10:51.930 --> 01:10:55.170
I should let you know
that I'm not hung up
on Angie anymore.

01:10:57.300 --> 01:11:00.100
I think I might
love... Millicent.

01:11:02.610 --> 01:11:03.670
Why?

01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:06.340
You're funny.

01:11:06.850 --> 01:11:08.180
You're smart.

01:11:09.650 --> 01:11:10.950
Brave.

01:11:11.850 --> 01:11:12.980
And?

01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:14.550
And beautiful.

01:11:14.550 --> 01:11:18.090
You're really beautiful
even when you're
being disgusting.

01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:22.190
You're an idiot.

01:11:22.190 --> 01:11:23.460
I know.

01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:25.730
I'd still really like
to have sex with you though.

01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:28.470
Not gonna happen.

01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:31.100
Damn it, Zade.

01:11:34.010 --> 01:11:36.170
Stop being such a fucking prude.

01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:41.110
Okay.

01:11:41.610 --> 01:11:42.550
See?

01:11:43.450 --> 01:11:44.950
Just come back inside

01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:48.390
so Zade and I can have
sexual intercourse.

01:11:48.390 --> 01:11:51.090
You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:53.320
Well...

01:11:54.430 --> 01:11:57.960
If you don't come back inside
and you jump

01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:00.500
Zade and I definitely won't
have sex.

01:12:02.970 --> 01:12:04.300
How about it?

01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:06.070
He jumps,

01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:07.570
are you still gonna do me?

01:12:08.510 --> 01:12:09.740
Definitely not.

01:12:13.710 --> 01:12:16.380
All right.
Enough of this shit, huh?

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:20.320
I don't wanna drink anyways.
Beer is flat.

01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:24.020
Wait, hold on!

01:12:24.020 --> 01:12:25.790
- Hank!
- Hank!

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.700
Pull me up, you son of a bitch!

01:13:00.090 --> 01:13:01.390
Is he asleep?

01:13:01.890 --> 01:13:03.290
I think so.

01:13:16.270 --> 01:13:18.780
There's clean sheets
in the walk-in closet.

01:13:19.710 --> 01:13:21.180
Swiss cotton.

01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:40.300
Are you sure
you want to do this?

01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:43.630
Oh, okay.

01:14:28.010 --> 01:14:29.710
You're clenching my feet.

01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:33.850
We broke the curse.

01:14:36.790 --> 01:14:38.220
So, can I call you?

01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:41.190
Well, why would you need
to call me?

01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:44.390
So we can see each other again.

01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:46.560
That will cost you.

01:14:49.270 --> 01:14:51.440
How much is a day pass
at Tramps again?

01:14:56.140 --> 01:14:57.640
Nothing bad happened.

01:14:58.040 --> 01:14:59.180
No.

01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:05.320
I think you should get that.

01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:08.290
Okay.

01:15:08.290 --> 01:15:10.590
If it's a stripper
don't let her in.

01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:11.520
Okay.

01:15:14.990 --> 01:15:16.760
Holy fucking shit!

01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:19.400
Are you okay?

01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:21.700
I'm okay. I'm okay.

01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:23.030
- I'm okay.
- Okay.

01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:24.370
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:15:24.670 --> 01:15:25.900
I'm okay.

01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:29.370
I'm not cursed. I'm not cursed.
I'm not cursed.

01:15:33.710 --> 01:15:34.750
Hello.
