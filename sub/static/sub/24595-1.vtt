MADRID
JUNE 15TH, 1991

00:54.542 --> 00:58.501
01:35 A.M.

00:58.709 --> 00:59.376
<i>It's okay.</i>

00:59.542 --> 01:01.251
<i>Please, calm down
so I can understand you.</i>

01:01.417 --> 01:03.126
<i>- What happened?
- Please, you have to come!</i>

01:03.292 --> 01:04.501
<i>He's inside! He's inside!</i>

01:11.417 --> 01:14.167
<i>Please, calm down.
Tell me what you're seeing.</i>

01:20.376 --> 01:22.917
Is there someone in your house?

01:23.542 --> 01:24.792
Hello!

01:30.709 --> 01:31.792
Detective!

01:31.959 --> 01:34.292
That's the building there, 3C.

01:42.042 --> 01:43.709
He's here.

01:54.959 --> 01:57.334
Mom! Mom!

01:59.584 --> 02:00.501
Detective!

02:00.667 --> 02:04.084
<i>We're going to send someone
right away. I need your address.</i>

02:04.251 --> 02:06.834
<i>8 Gerardo Núñez Street.</i>

02:08.959 --> 02:11.167
<i>Are you still there?</i>

02:11.334 --> 02:12.334
<i>Hello?</i>

02:14.209 --> 02:18.251
<i>Calling all units, we have a 402
at 8 Gerardo Núñez Street.</i>

02:18.417 --> 02:20.917
<i>Any available cars please respond.</i>

02:21.084 --> 02:23.417
<i>I repeat, 8 Gerardo Núñez Street.</i>

02:29.459 --> 02:32.042
EARLY MORNING, JUNE 15TH, 1991,

02:32.209 --> 02:34.584
MADRID POLICE STATION 02-12
RECEIVED AN EMERGENCY PHONE CALL.

02:48.626 --> 02:51.376
THIS STORY IS BASED
ON THE POLICE REPORT...

02:51.542 --> 02:53.417
...FILED BY THE DETECTIVE
IN CHARGE OF THE CASE.

02:54.917 --> 02:56.209
<i>It's confirmed.</i>

02:56.417 --> 02:58.751
<i>There are four kids,
two more are upstairs.</i>

THREE DAYS EARLIER

03:30.751 --> 03:36.292
THURSDAY, JUNE 12TH, 1991

03:47.834 --> 03:50.376
Irene,
you get the bathroom first.

04:00.417 --> 04:01.626
Lucia, let's go!

04:02.667 --> 04:03.667
Get up.

04:05.584 --> 04:07.251
Don't make any noise.

04:08.834 --> 04:10.417
Come on, buddy, get up.

04:13.459 --> 04:15.001
Let's go to school.

04:16.334 --> 04:18.291
I want to go to school.

04:18.625 --> 04:20.334
You want to go to school?

04:20.500 --> 04:21.709
Great.

04:23.501 --> 04:26.001
- You wet the bed again?!
- Yeah.

04:28.251 --> 04:29.459
Come here.

04:37.792 --> 04:39.709
Tell Irene
to clean you up in the bathroom.

04:43.334 --> 04:44.292
Vero!

04:44.459 --> 04:46.834
- What's wrong?
- Irene won't let me in.

04:52.376 --> 04:54.917
- I'm taking a shower!
- Stop yelling!

04:55.084 --> 04:58.042
He peed himself again.
Clean him up, you're older than him.

04:58.251 --> 04:59.084
Fine.

05:00.792 --> 05:03.709
I heard you.
I'm older, I came out first.

05:03.834 --> 05:05.792
- Did you heat the milk?
- No.

05:05.959 --> 05:07.459
Quite the older sister you are.

05:50.126 --> 05:52.542
Lucia!
Pay attention, please!

05:52.709 --> 05:55.584
The teacher said to bring
pictures to look at the eclipse.

05:55.751 --> 05:57.292
- Pictures?
- Yeah.

05:57.501 --> 06:02.292
Your turn. Not pictures.
Negatives, to shield our eyes.

06:02.459 --> 06:04.334
Gross!
The towel smells like chicken.

06:04.501 --> 06:06.459
You smell like wet chicken.

06:06.667 --> 06:09.209
- Stop it! Vero!
- Lucia, leave Irene alone.

06:09.542 --> 06:11.459
Take one of
the towels hanging outside.

06:12.126 --> 06:13.584
Your shoes are untied.

06:13.792 --> 06:16.001
You could have told me
about the pictures last night.

06:16.209 --> 06:19.501
- Me, me, me.
- Fine, you do it.

07:28.834 --> 07:31.584
- Everything OK?
- Yeah.

07:32.709 --> 07:35.959
We had a birthday party
and closed at 2 AM last night.

07:36.167 --> 07:38.042
I'm exhausted.

07:38.459 --> 07:40.834
I came to get
a picture for a class project.

07:41.459 --> 07:42.501
You rest.

07:43.126 --> 07:44.959
I'm going to sleep some more.

07:45.167 --> 07:46.584
I'll see you later.

07:58.292 --> 08:01.834
<i>I heard it was night.</i>

08:02.626 --> 08:06.542
<i>It's all magic.</i>

08:07.001 --> 08:13.126
<i>And a spirit
invited you to dream.</i>

08:13.542 --> 08:18.042
<i>I know that lately,</i>

08:18.792 --> 08:22.542
<i>I've barely stopped.</i>

08:23.251 --> 08:28.209
<i>I feel like I'm rambling...</i>

08:30.251 --> 08:34.001
<i>Dawn breaks so early,</i>

08:34.167 --> 08:37.792
<i>and I'm so alone,</i>

08:38.917 --> 08:44.208
<i>and I'm not sorry for yesterday.</i>

08:44.376 --> 08:48.667
<i>If the stars light you,</i>

08:49.251 --> 08:53.417
<i>today they're your guide.</i>

08:53.584 --> 08:58.126
<i>You feel so strong, you think,</i>

08:59.459 --> 09:03.792
<i>no one can touch you...</i>

09:19.167 --> 09:22.584
- What's up?
- I won't wet the bed tomorrow.

09:22.751 --> 09:25.751
- What?
- I won't wet the bed tomorrow!

09:25.917 --> 09:28.667
Good!
OK, go inside.

09:30.417 --> 09:32.251
- How are you?
- Fine.

09:32.417 --> 09:34.709
- You have fun?
- Yeah.

09:35.834 --> 09:39.917
You know the earth
always revolves around its own axis.

09:40.126 --> 09:42.334
It also revolves around the sun.

09:42.542 --> 09:44.834
But the moon,
which is a satellite,

09:45.084 --> 09:47.001
revolves around the earth.

09:47.209 --> 09:51.501
When the moon goes
between the sun and the earth,

09:51.709 --> 09:54.917
an astronomical phenomenon occurs,
and we call this a solar eclipse.

09:55.126 --> 09:58.667
The moon's shadow
is cast on the earth's surface.

09:59.542 --> 10:02.709
It's interesting,
because it's subjective.

10:02.834 --> 10:04.834
It depends on
the subject looking at it.

10:05.917 --> 10:08.751
What we see here today in Madrid...

10:08.917 --> 10:11.251
...is not what they see
in Barcelona, or in Paris.

10:11.417 --> 10:13.334
Next slide, please.

10:13.501 --> 10:16.667
We can clearly see two different areas:

10:16.834 --> 10:18.834
the shadow, or umbra area,

10:19.084 --> 10:20.501
and the penumbra area.

10:21.126 --> 10:23.709
The umbra has no light,

10:23.834 --> 10:25.126
in total darkness.

10:25.292 --> 10:26.042
Do YOU HAVE IT?

10:26.292 --> 10:29.376
The penumbra is
the fragile shadow area.

10:30.292 --> 10:37.417
Superstition has given
many explanations for eclipses.

10:37.626 --> 10:38.751
Next slide, please.

10:41.126 --> 10:42.917
Primitive cultures believed...

10:43.417 --> 10:46.834
...that the sky
reflected what happened on earth.

10:47.459 --> 10:50.251
So they believed
that during eclipses...

10:50.459 --> 10:52.959
...darkness reigned over light.

10:53.167 --> 10:56.501
In many cultures,
they thought that eclipses...

10:56.709 --> 10:59.667
...were a good time for sacrifices.

10:59.834 --> 11:01.251
Next slide, please.

11:01.417 --> 11:03.417
Even human sacrifices.

11:03.626 --> 11:05.709
In fact, they'll explain it
better in History class, but...

11:05.917 --> 11:09.167
...the Maya
believed that human blood was...

11:24.334 --> 11:25.501
Well, we're out of time.

11:25.667 --> 11:26.917
We have to go see the eclipse,

11:27.084 --> 11:29.709
but when we come back,
we'll talk about the different kinds.

11:29.834 --> 11:31.417
Sara,
help me with the window, please.

11:31.584 --> 11:34.834
If you don't have a picture,
take it from the box over there, OK?

11:35.084 --> 11:36.126
OK.

11:36.292 --> 11:39.167
And remember not to look at the sun,
only look through the negative.

11:49.751 --> 11:51.751
- Wait a minute.
- No, let's go.

11:51.917 --> 11:53.334
- Just a second.
- Girls, upstairs!

11:53.501 --> 11:55.917
- Rosa, turn the projector off.
- OK.

12:14.626 --> 12:15.709
Wait...

12:16.626 --> 12:17.834
What's wrong?

12:18.251 --> 12:19.834
We have to wait for Diana.

12:20.001 --> 12:21.459
The one
who got held back?

12:21.626 --> 12:24.126
Yeah, I told her what we were doing

12:24.334 --> 12:25.584
and she wants to come.

12:25.751 --> 12:29.042
Rosa, it was supposed
to be between the two of us.

12:29.251 --> 12:31.251
Well, now it's
between us, and Diana.

12:31.417 --> 12:32.417
She's really nice, anyway.

12:32.751 --> 12:33.917
Besides...

12:34.209 --> 12:37.459
Remember Manolo?
With the spiked hair?

12:37.792 --> 12:39.459
The one who died
in a motorcycle wreck!

12:39.626 --> 12:42.167
- He was her boyfriend.
- Why'd you have to tell her?

12:42.334 --> 12:43.917
Sorry, it just slipped out.

12:44.084 --> 12:47.167
But everybody knows
it works better with odd numbers.

12:48.334 --> 12:51.001
Everyone's upstairs.
The coast is clear now.

12:52.167 --> 12:53.667
Begoña,
what is this junk?

12:53.834 --> 12:54.834
Not with these!

12:59.584 --> 13:00.792
Girls!

13:02.251 --> 13:04.626
Get in place,
it's about to start.

13:04.834 --> 13:07.042
Come on,
over here.

13:07.251 --> 13:09.834
Look,
the negatives and the...

13:18.626 --> 13:20.042
Gross!

13:31.542 --> 13:32.834
Stay together.

13:33.209 --> 13:34.751
It's this way!

13:35.917 --> 13:37.501
Hey, wait for me!

13:54.834 --> 13:55.751
Here.

14:05.417 --> 14:08.834
This is disgusting.
Have you guys done this before?

14:09.001 --> 14:12.751
Yeah, in my village.
You said you have too, right?

14:12.917 --> 14:16.501
Yeah, but with
paper cut-outs, you know?

14:16.667 --> 14:19.667
Never with an official board.

14:21.417 --> 14:24.417
THE GREAT ENCYCLOPEDIA OF THE OCCULT

14:25.709 --> 14:28.001
They're dead, but that doesn't mean
they know everything, right?

14:34.667 --> 14:35.792
What did you bring?

14:36.001 --> 14:37.001
A picture.

14:37.209 --> 14:38.209
What is that?

14:39.626 --> 14:43.376
You need a personal item
of the person you want to contact.

14:43.584 --> 14:45.834
A picture
isn't a personal item!

14:46.584 --> 14:47.542
Of course it is!

14:47.751 --> 14:50.084
It's personal if it belongs
to the person in the picture.

14:52.001 --> 14:54.167
I didn't bring
any of Manolo's stuff.

14:55.792 --> 14:58.501
Can you see it?
The moon is going between.

14:59.417 --> 15:02.667
See the ring? See it?
Look, it's the solar ring.

15:02.834 --> 15:04.292
I can't believe it!

15:04.459 --> 15:08.251
Always look through...
Look at it with this, OK?

15:08.417 --> 15:09.501
It's so beautiful!

15:11.584 --> 15:14.167
<i>It says to put
your index finger on the glass.</i>

15:17.042 --> 15:19.459
- Close your eyes.
- Why?

15:20.459 --> 15:22.376
Because you
make contact faster.

15:50.626 --> 15:52.792
Is anyone with us?

16:17.209 --> 16:19.251
Is there
anyone here with us?

16:33.667 --> 16:35.042
It wasn't me, I swear!

16:41.459 --> 16:42.667
Who are you?

16:48.209 --> 16:49.959
You want
to talk to one of us?

17:02.917 --> 17:04.041
<i>Are you...?</i>

17:04.251 --> 17:05.751
<i>Are you Veronica's Dad?</i>

17:12.084 --> 17:14.291
Do you want
to talk to Veronica?

17:16.291 --> 17:17.291
S...

17:19.084 --> 17:19.916
P...

17:21.251 --> 17:22.126
Y...

17:24.291 --> 17:25.459
I spy.

17:25.626 --> 17:27.541
- What do you spy?
- With my little eye...

17:27.751 --> 17:30.501
- What are you, a dumbass?
- You're the dumbass!

17:30.667 --> 17:32.126
I know you're moving it.

17:42.376 --> 17:44.834
Vero,
did you move it?

17:54.376 --> 17:55.542
Who are you?

18:06.251 --> 18:07.751
It burns!

18:41.542 --> 18:43.459
Vero, are you OK?
What's happening?

18:45.834 --> 18:46.584
Vero!

18:46.751 --> 18:47.376
No!

18:51.376 --> 18:52.417
Vero!

18:52.584 --> 18:53.959
Please, Vero, let's go!

18:54.126 --> 18:55.626
Please, Vero!

19:04.126 --> 19:05.167
Find the flashlight!

19:05.334 --> 19:06.792
Diana, the flashlight!

19:06.959 --> 19:08.501
- Where is it?
- Over there!

19:08.709 --> 19:10.376
- Rosa, I can't see!
- Fuck!

19:10.834 --> 19:11.376
Here it is!

19:11.584 --> 19:13.459
I've got it,
I've got it here.

19:13.626 --> 19:14.459
I've got it.

19:22.834 --> 19:23.667
Fuck!

19:28.709 --> 19:30.126
The board is broken.

19:30.751 --> 19:32.001
Where's Veronica?

19:32.709 --> 19:33.667
Veronica?

19:35.626 --> 19:36.959
Veronica!

19:38.334 --> 19:42.084
- Diana, go get help now!
- We're gonna get in trouble.

19:42.417 --> 19:43.459
Just go! Shut up!

19:43.667 --> 19:44.751
Veronica.

19:46.584 --> 19:47.501
Veronica!

19:48.209 --> 19:49.167
What's wrong?

19:51.459 --> 19:53.001
What are you saying?

20:25.251 --> 20:26.209
<i>Veronica.</i>

20:28.459 --> 20:29.792
Can you hear me?

20:31.542 --> 20:32.751
What happened to me?

20:33.542 --> 20:35.167
You fainted.

20:36.792 --> 20:38.084
Follow my finger.

20:40.959 --> 20:44.084
We tried to call your Mom,
but we couldn't get ahold of her.

20:45.626 --> 20:47.042
She's working.

20:48.834 --> 20:50.834
Have you ever
fainted like this before?

20:51.417 --> 20:52.292
No.

20:53.751 --> 20:55.292
Did you eat breakfast?

20:56.334 --> 20:57.626
Yes.

21:00.167 --> 21:01.376
Are you diabetic?

21:02.959 --> 21:04.126
Veronica!

21:04.334 --> 21:05.792
Would you listen to me?

21:06.334 --> 21:07.834
Are you diabetic?

21:08.501 --> 21:09.417
I don't know.

21:09.626 --> 21:11.542
Blood sugar, any problems?

21:12.084 --> 21:13.584
I don't know.

21:14.667 --> 21:17.209
Family history with diabetes?

21:17.917 --> 21:19.417
I don't think so.

21:21.834 --> 21:23.834
Did you take any drugs?

21:26.126 --> 21:27.626
- Pot, pills...?
- No, no.

21:27.792 --> 21:29.292
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

21:33.001 --> 21:34.667
Are you on your period?

21:41.626 --> 21:44.376
- Veronica, how old are you?
- Fifteen.

21:46.334 --> 21:47.834
And you haven't
had your period?

22:01.751 --> 22:04.251
It's probably low blood pressure.

22:04.459 --> 22:06.792
You might have an iron deficiency.

22:09.251 --> 22:12.459
If you can,
I recommend eating red meat today.

22:17.126 --> 22:18.751
Rest here for a few minutes.

22:18.917 --> 22:20.917
Class is almost over.

22:27.834 --> 22:30.334
- That's so cool!
- <i>Girls!</i>

22:30.542 --> 22:33.042
We always have to wait for you!

22:33.251 --> 22:34.459
What happened to your hand?

22:34.626 --> 22:37.251
I cut it on
some glass during recess.

22:37.834 --> 22:39.001
Will you let me see?

22:39.167 --> 22:40.834
- Where's Rosa?
- They left already.

22:41.126 --> 22:43.626
- They didn't wait for me?
- You missed the eclipse.

22:43.792 --> 22:46.042
- The sun was totally dark.
- <i>The sun was black.</i>

22:46.209 --> 22:47.459
It was really cool.

22:48.126 --> 22:49.626
Why weren't you there?

22:49.834 --> 22:52.501
I was in the nurse's office.
Hey, don't tell Mom about this.

22:52.667 --> 22:54.376
- About what?
- About my cut, OK?

22:55.917 --> 22:58.751
- Zip your lips...
- Zip your lips...

22:58.876 --> 23:00.751
...zip your lips...

23:00.917 --> 23:04.626
...and throw away the key.

23:05.376 --> 23:06.376
Come on, let's go.

23:17.584 --> 23:20.584
- What's wrong, Irene?
- Sister Death is looking at you.

23:21.792 --> 23:24.584
But she's blind,
she can't see anything.

23:25.126 --> 23:26.584
<i>She's blind.</i>

23:28.084 --> 23:31.042
- Wasn't she deaf?
- No, blind, not deaf.

23:44.626 --> 23:46.917
BEST MOM IN THE WORLD

23:56.834 --> 23:59.042
- Hi, Mom!
- Hey there!

24:00.001 --> 24:01.834
Can I have
money to play Martians?

24:02.084 --> 24:03.042
Fine,
you take it.

24:03.876 --> 24:05.834
But just one round,
then you go home, OK?

24:06.626 --> 24:07.417
Mom?

24:07.584 --> 24:10.042
- Not in front of the kids, man!
- Mom!

24:11.959 --> 24:14.042
Give me
the desserts for the 7!

24:14.251 --> 24:15.626
Stop for a second, please.

24:17.167 --> 24:19.751
Why do you cover up
such a beautiful face?

24:19.876 --> 24:20.459
Mom!

24:20.626 --> 24:23.792
I'll give you Tupperware
with macaroni for tonight.

24:24.709 --> 24:25.501
Mom!

24:25.667 --> 24:27.751
Get Antoñito
and go home to eat.

24:28.834 --> 24:29.584
Come on!

24:32.251 --> 24:33.834
I'm starving,
my stomach is rumbling.

24:34.001 --> 24:36.084
- They're farts.
- You're the one farting.

24:36.251 --> 24:38.042
Farts, farts, farts...

24:38.209 --> 24:40.751
- Irene, heat up the food.
- Why me?

24:40.917 --> 24:43.834
- I always have to do it!
- Antoñito, go wash your hands.

24:44.001 --> 24:45.584
Because I'm the favorite.

25:08.042 --> 25:09.001
What's that?

25:10.834 --> 25:13.251
Nothing.
Go set the table.

26:44.667 --> 26:45.876
Vero!

26:46.459 --> 26:48.084
Didn't I tell you to set the table?

26:58.334 --> 26:59.667
You keep an eye on it.

27:11.584 --> 27:13.251
- This much?
- Yeah.

27:13.792 --> 27:17.667
Then, in front of
the sun, there was...

27:17.834 --> 27:22.126
- It was all black and dark.
- It was the moon!

27:22.917 --> 27:26.167
You didn't understand
what the science teacher said.

27:26.376 --> 27:31.667
Imagine a black ball
and then a yellow ball.

27:31.834 --> 27:36.667
The black one covers the yellow one,
which is the sun.

27:36.834 --> 27:38.459
-Irene, can you get some milk?
- You get it!

27:38.709 --> 27:39.709
Rock, paper or scissors?

27:39.834 --> 27:41.792
Rock, paper, scissors.

27:41.917 --> 27:44.042
One, two, three. Now!

27:44.917 --> 27:47.417
-I won!
- No, best two out of three.

27:47.626 --> 27:51.376
Rock, paper, scissors.
One, two, three. Now!

27:51.667 --> 27:54.917
Rock, paper, scissors.
One, two, three. Now!

27:55.126 --> 27:56.001
Crap!

27:56.209 --> 27:58.542
I beat you, I beat you, I beat you...

27:59.167 --> 28:03.417
- You cheated.
- I cheated? You cheated!

28:03.626 --> 28:06.501
I never complain when you win.

28:07.667 --> 28:09.792
There's no milk
left in the fridge, over.

28:09.917 --> 28:11.751
It's in the pantry, over.

28:33.084 --> 28:34.251
Veronica?

28:35.834 --> 28:36.834
Veronica?

28:37.501 --> 28:38.459
Hello?

28:42.042 --> 28:44.334
Irene, come here.
Veronica's all frozen up.

28:49.417 --> 28:50.417
Veronica?

29:03.751 --> 29:04.917
Veronica?

29:05.876 --> 29:07.709
- Veronica!
- Good thing it says easy-open.

29:07.834 --> 29:08.834
Veronica!

29:22.834 --> 29:23.834
What happened?

29:24.376 --> 29:25.667
You weren't moving.

29:25.834 --> 29:27.334
And you puked.

29:27.501 --> 29:29.001
Are you OK?

29:29.667 --> 29:32.792
I'm fine.
Clean this up, please.

30:11.584 --> 30:13.167
I'll get it.

30:19.126 --> 30:20.042
<i>Yeah, OK.</i>

30:20.209 --> 30:22.126
Yeah, I'll tell her.

30:22.834 --> 30:24.334
Bye-bye.

30:27.334 --> 30:28.126
Who was it?

30:28.334 --> 30:29.334
Rosa.

30:29.917 --> 30:31.584
Why didn't you give me the phone?

30:31.751 --> 30:33.042
She said she couldn't come,

30:33.251 --> 30:35.042
she has to run
some errands with her mom.

30:37.084 --> 30:38.751
She didn't ask to talk to me?

30:39.459 --> 30:40.417
No.

30:56.834 --> 30:57.834
<i>Hello?</i>

30:58.167 --> 31:00.334
Hi, it's Veronica.
Is Rosa there?

31:00.501 --> 31:02.376
<i>Hi, Vero.
No, she isn't here.</i>

31:02.542 --> 31:04.167
But she just called.

31:04.459 --> 31:07.542
<i>She just went out the door with Diana...</i>

31:07.751 --> 31:09.834
<i>I thought
all three of you were meeting.</i>

31:11.001 --> 31:11.751
<i>Vero.</i>

31:11.876 --> 31:14.251
Yeah, yeah.
I'm running late.

31:15.084 --> 31:17.709
<i>Tell her not to forget
that she has to be home by eight.</i>

31:17.876 --> 31:19.167
OK, I'll let her know.

31:19.376 --> 31:20.876
<i>Thanks, sweetheart.
See you soon.</i>

31:39.792 --> 31:42.501
<i>Centella gives me time to enjoy,</i>

31:43.751 --> 31:46.834
<i>Centella, Centella.</i>

31:47.584 --> 31:50.834
<i>Centella gives me time to enjoy...</i>

31:51.001 --> 31:52.834
Girls, put your PJs on.

31:54.376 --> 31:56.042
<i>Seven! You're in the bathroom!</i>

31:56.209 --> 31:58.167
Doesn't count!
Vero told.

31:58.376 --> 31:59.126
Let's start over.

31:59.334 --> 32:01.959
<i>Centella gives me time to enjoy...</i>

32:02.626 --> 32:05.542
Antoñito, that's enough!
You sound like a parrot!

32:05.709 --> 32:07.751
If you don't know the jingle,
why are you singing it?

32:10.167 --> 32:11.084
Yeah, yeah.

32:12.501 --> 32:13.917
I see you...

32:14.584 --> 32:17.251
<i>Oh, time to myself...</i>

32:17.751 --> 32:20.167
<i>Oh, time for life...</i>

32:20.626 --> 32:23.959
<i>Centella gives me time to enjoy...</i>

32:24.917 --> 32:26.542
<i>Centella...</i>

32:26.834 --> 32:28.542
Girls, behave.

32:37.584 --> 32:39.084
Scrub hard, I'll be right back.

32:43.376 --> 32:44.834
Girls, please.

32:45.417 --> 32:46.042
What?

32:53.959 --> 32:58.042
<i>Oh, time to myself, time for life...</i>

32:58.792 --> 33:01.709
<i>Centella gives me time to enjoy...</i>

33:16.501 --> 33:17.209
Vero.

33:17.792 --> 33:18.667
Vero!

33:20.209 --> 33:21.501
Antoñito!

33:22.584 --> 33:23.959
Antoñito!

33:24.417 --> 33:26.042
- Vero!
- Antoñito!

33:26.251 --> 33:27.209
Vero!

33:28.709 --> 33:29.542
Antoñito!

33:30.126 --> 33:31.167
Antoñito, what's wrong?

33:31.376 --> 33:32.001
It burns!

33:32.167 --> 33:32.834
What happened?

33:39.792 --> 33:40.751
What happened?

33:43.917 --> 33:46.042
- What is that?
- It burns.

33:46.667 --> 33:47.792
Did you touch the faucet?

33:49.876 --> 33:50.959
I didn't do anything.

33:59.209 --> 34:01.376
One, two, three, guess!

34:03.834 --> 34:05.626
- A bird.
- No.

34:16.417 --> 34:17.376
A flower.

34:17.667 --> 34:18.376
No.

34:18.542 --> 34:20.001
A dog.
Turn over.

34:28.958 --> 34:31.208
One, two, three, guess!

34:35.958 --> 34:38.542
- A balloon!
- Yes!

34:42.626 --> 34:44.626
I'm sorry
I put the water on so hot.

34:45.833 --> 34:47.126
It wasn't you.

34:48.708 --> 34:49.542
What?

34:49.708 --> 34:51.417
It wasn't you.

34:52.376 --> 34:53.667
What did you say?

34:55.583 --> 34:58.251
I won't wet the bed tomorrow.

35:35.917 --> 35:38.834
<i>Centella gives me time to enjoy,</i>

35:39.001 --> 35:41.709
<i>Centella, Centella.</i>

35:41.876 --> 35:44.876
<i>Centella gives me a shiny floor,</i>

35:45.042 --> 35:47.417
<i>Centella, Centella.</i>

35:47.626 --> 35:50.167
<i>Oh, time to myself,</i>

35:50.417 --> 35:51.917
<i>Time for life.</i>

35:52.084 --> 35:54.792
<i>Centella gives me time to enjoy,</i>

35:54.917 --> 35:58.001
<i>Centella, Centella.</i>

37:35.417 --> 37:37.251
<i>Let's go...</i>

37:37.501 --> 37:40.876
<i>...leave this room,
go to outer space...</i>

37:41.042 --> 37:44.792
<i>...your eyes glaze over...</i>

37:44.917 --> 37:49.917
<i>...all the same color.</i>

37:51.542 --> 37:56.167
<i>Let's go,
leave this room...</i>

37:56.376 --> 38:02.126
<i>...go to outer space,
your eyes glaze over...</i>

38:02.334 --> 38:07.459
<i>...all the same color.</i>

38:08.709 --> 38:12.667
<i>While nothing matters!</i>

38:14.626 --> 38:15.876
<i>Nine...</i>

38:16.042 --> 38:17.126
<i>Eight...</i>

38:17.334 --> 38:18.334
<i>Seven...</i>

38:18.501 --> 38:19.417
<i>Six...</i>

38:19.584 --> 38:20.501
<i>Five...</i>

38:20.667 --> 38:21.501
<i>Four...</i>

38:21.667 --> 38:22.542
<i>Three...</i>

38:22.709 --> 38:23.542
<i>Two...</i>

38:23.709 --> 38:24.751
<i>One!</i>

39:05.626 --> 39:06.709
Vero...

39:26.042 --> 39:27.251
What are you doing here?

39:30.959 --> 39:32.334
<i>Veronica...</i>

39:40.792 --> 39:42.376
Veronica...

39:43.084 --> 39:44.959
Veronica...

39:45.376 --> 39:46.834
Veronica...

40:01.501 --> 40:02.626
Dad?

40:40.167 --> 40:44.876
FRIDAY, JUNE 13TH, 1991

40:45.042 --> 40:47.542
08:29 A.M.

40:55.667 --> 40:57.334
Antoñito, what's wrong?

40:57.542 --> 40:59.001
It just leaked out.

41:07.667 --> 41:08.792
It's 8:30?

41:12.126 --> 41:15.167
- Come on, run!
- Why's it always Veronica's fault?

41:22.459 --> 41:24.834
- No, no, don't close!
- Please, just a second!

41:27.251 --> 41:28.959
- By the skin of your teeth.
- Thank you.

41:29.126 --> 41:30.167
Thank you!

41:32.042 --> 41:34.167
Becquer's "Legends" started...

41:34.334 --> 41:39.001
...with an introduction
to transport the reader back in time.

41:39.834 --> 41:45.459
A character would warn
the protagonist about a prohibition,

41:45.667 --> 41:50.667
and then, this main character
would cross the allowed limit...

41:50.876 --> 41:54.042
...and suffer
punishment for their infraction.

41:54.209 --> 41:57.417
Alonso and Beatriz
die because of Beatriz's imprudence...

41:57.584 --> 42:00.459
...when she forced Alonso
to go up of the Mount of Spirits...

42:00.626 --> 42:02.084
...on All Saints Day.

42:02.292 --> 42:04.834
In "The Kiss,"
Lope de Ayala attacks...

42:05.084 --> 42:08.584
...his captain for profaning
the statue of Doña Elvira.

42:08.792 --> 42:12.001
In short,
no one escapes the consequences...

42:12.209 --> 42:17.751
...of passing the limit
that divides reality from fantasy.

42:18.042 --> 42:20.542
Please open your copy of "Legends,"

42:20.751 --> 42:24.751
we're going to read
"The Mount of Spirits" together.

42:26.084 --> 42:28.667
So I'll start.

42:29.626 --> 42:32.792
"On the night of the dead,
the pealing of the bells...

42:33.042 --> 42:34.792
...woke me
at who knows what hour;

42:35.042 --> 42:37.501
the monotonous
and eternal tolling...

42:37.709 --> 42:40.084
...brought to mind this tradition..."

42:40.251 --> 42:41.501
- Yes?
- May I go to the bathroom?

42:41.667 --> 42:42.334
Of course.

42:43.709 --> 42:48.292
"Once prodded,
the imagination is a horse run wild ..."

43:34.459 --> 43:38.167
You know when you go inside a house,
and they've just made French toast?

43:40.917 --> 43:43.126
It's easy to tell the smell.

43:47.376 --> 43:49.001
That smell of cinnamon...

43:49.876 --> 43:51.209
Fried bread...

43:52.001 --> 43:53.417
Warm milk.

43:56.001 --> 43:57.667
If you close your eyes,

43:57.834 --> 43:59.709
it's like they're
on a dish in front of you.

44:01.251 --> 44:03.251
You could almost take a bite.

44:07.251 --> 44:09.584
I was
a Language and Lit teacher.

44:11.751 --> 44:14.292
The French toast is a metaphor.

44:17.084 --> 44:19.834
- What grade are you in?
- Ninth.

44:20.709 --> 44:23.126
So you know
what a metaphor is, right?

44:25.626 --> 44:28.334
And you also know
we aren't talking about desserts.

44:31.876 --> 44:34.251
- Do you smoke?
- No.

44:34.376 --> 44:35.417
Good.

44:39.376 --> 44:41.001
They call you Sister Death.

44:41.626 --> 44:42.376
I know.

44:44.042 --> 44:45.501
- That doesn't bother you?
- No.

44:49.459 --> 44:53.292
I like it.
Better than Sister Narcisa, right?

45:01.709 --> 45:03.167
What's in your hand?

45:04.626 --> 45:05.917
How do you know
I'm holding something?

45:08.376 --> 45:11.042
You don't
always need eyes to see.

45:12.667 --> 45:13.751
Can I see?

45:28.667 --> 45:31.501
What you did here
is really dangerous.

45:32.126 --> 45:33.751
I just wanted
to talk to my Dad.

45:33.917 --> 45:35.751
It's not who you want to talk to.

45:36.001 --> 45:37.376
It's who you talk to.

45:37.751 --> 45:39.209
If it isn't my Dad,
then who is it?

45:40.334 --> 45:42.501
- You have siblings, don't you?
- Three of them.

45:43.167 --> 45:44.876
You'll have to protect them.

45:51.167 --> 45:52.834
Protect them from what?

45:59.917 --> 46:01.542
You all stop moving!

46:01.917 --> 46:03.084
Stop moving!

46:04.001 --> 46:05.501
You all stop moving!

46:05.834 --> 46:07.167
Don't move!

46:08.209 --> 46:09.584
But I'm alone.

46:11.167 --> 46:12.042
No.

46:13.876 --> 46:15.167
You aren't alone.

46:16.501 --> 46:19.042
Someone answered your call.

46:20.876 --> 46:22.876
And now walks with you.

46:25.001 --> 46:26.084
Don't move.

46:36.126 --> 46:37.792
In the name of
our Lord Jesus Christ,

46:38.001 --> 46:40.042
leave this body
that does not belong to you.

46:40.209 --> 46:41.501
In the name of
our Lord Jesus Christ,

46:41.667 --> 46:43.751
leave this body
that does not belong to you.

47:06.376 --> 47:07.834
Recess is over, girl.

47:15.292 --> 47:17.501
Run, run, run.

47:18.751 --> 47:20.501
Maybe you'll get away.

47:40.876 --> 47:42.042
Rosa!

47:52.626 --> 47:53.584
Hi!

47:55.167 --> 47:56.167
Who's that?

47:56.584 --> 47:59.626
Felipe, my cousin's classmate
from trade school.

48:00.542 --> 48:03.001
- What did you want?
- You're mad at me.

48:03.251 --> 48:04.876
Vero,
why would I be mad at you?

48:05.126 --> 48:06.501
You didn't come over yesterday.

48:06.709 --> 48:09.584
I had to go with my Mom,
didn't your sister tell you?

48:10.126 --> 48:11.834
It's because of yesterday, isn't it?

48:14.501 --> 48:18.376
The ouija board is stupid.
You say dumb stuff and move a glass.

48:18.542 --> 48:19.584
You noticed something, too.

48:21.001 --> 48:21.876
Rosa!

48:26.251 --> 48:29.251
- You saw it, too, didn't you?
- Saw what, Vero?

48:29.376 --> 48:30.584
- Since yesterday, I've been seeing...
- Rosa!

48:30.792 --> 48:32.876
We have to go quick,
the store is going to close.

48:33.334 --> 48:35.001
- Are you coming?
- Where?

48:35.167 --> 48:39.417
We're throwing a party because
Rosa's parents are gone this weekend.

48:41.459 --> 48:43.042
Why didn't you tell me?

48:44.876 --> 48:46.667
Dude, she's telling you now.

48:47.459 --> 48:49.542
Besides,
I doubt you can come, right?

48:49.751 --> 48:51.792
You have to babysit
your brother and sisters.

48:52.792 --> 48:53.792
Let's go.

48:57.459 --> 48:58.501
Vero!

48:59.626 --> 49:02.376
- Drop by if you can.
- Come on, we're late!

49:21.334 --> 49:23.376
Lucia,
stop copying my homework!

49:23.542 --> 49:25.584
THE GREAT ENCYCLOPEDIA OF THE OCCULT

49:25.751 --> 49:28.667
This is boring!
It's always the same!

49:30.042 --> 49:31.584
Antoñito, that's enough!

49:31.792 --> 49:32.917
Go play in your room.

49:33.459 --> 49:37.126
Lucia, stop copying your
sister's homework, you won't learn!

49:37.334 --> 49:40.209
-I learn when I copy, too.
- You're such a piece of work.

49:40.334 --> 49:43.584
You're going to do it, anyway.
Why do you care? You're so selfish!

49:43.751 --> 49:45.251
You're always the same!

49:45.376 --> 49:47.542
Then you do it one day
and I'll copy!

49:47.709 --> 49:51.292
We could do rock, paper, scissors
but you do it better.

49:51.417 --> 49:53.001
It's not that I do it better...

49:53.167 --> 49:55.001
<i>You have siblings, don't you?</i>

49:55.334 --> 49:56.834
<i>You'll have to protect them.</i>

50:21.459 --> 50:23.834
VIKING SYMBOLS OF PROTECTION

50:30.167 --> 50:34.084
Representing Madrid,
Lucia Gomez, 19 years old...

50:34.292 --> 50:38.292
...she is a doctor,
lawyer, lifeguard and firefighter.

50:38.459 --> 50:41.667
But there's a secret
nobody knows about Miss Madrid:

50:41.834 --> 50:43.126
she's a robot!

50:43.292 --> 50:48.542
And the robot has super duper
smart artificial intelligence.

50:48.751 --> 50:52.876
Miss Madrid,
soon to be contender for Miss Spain.

50:53.084 --> 50:53.917
What's that?

50:54.167 --> 50:55.459
A thing we made in class.

50:56.001 --> 50:56.876
How ugly!

50:57.251 --> 50:58.501
Take that, Miss Madrid!

51:00.417 --> 51:04.167
Will you win
the crown as Miss Spain?

51:04.334 --> 51:05.126
Yes or no!

51:05.292 --> 51:06.792
Soon in theaters near you.

51:07.542 --> 51:11.126
Miss Madrid is 25 years old,
has 7 children...

51:13.084 --> 51:14.209
Who is it?

51:14.376 --> 51:15.334
Josefa.

51:20.167 --> 51:22.417
- Where's your Mom?
- At the bar.

51:22.584 --> 51:25.376
Uh-huh.
Wanna tell me what you all are up to?

51:26.042 --> 51:27.001
What's wrong?

51:27.167 --> 51:29.876
The lamps!
Are you dancing or what?

51:30.126 --> 51:31.251
The lamps won't stop shaking!

51:31.376 --> 51:33.376
- We're not doing anything.
- Really?

51:33.542 --> 51:35.751
It looks like my
ceiling is going to crash on me.

51:35.917 --> 51:37.251
Something else:

51:37.417 --> 51:40.626
I've got a huge black stain,
right on top of your bedroom.

51:41.709 --> 51:43.126
You have moisture problems?

51:43.292 --> 51:45.667
- I don't know, I'll tell my Mom later.
- Yeah, right!

51:45.876 --> 51:47.417
If you see her, that is, huh?

51:48.251 --> 51:51.001
You'll sleep well tonight
with all that running around.

51:51.751 --> 51:53.084
Fucking kids.

52:45.917 --> 52:46.834
Shit!

52:54.292 --> 52:55.376
<i>Veronica.</i>

52:57.126 --> 52:58.417
<i>Veronica.</i>

53:00.251 --> 53:01.501
What are you doing awake?

53:13.376 --> 53:15.792
Lucia, it isn't funny.
I can see your room from here.

53:18.376 --> 53:20.792
<i>Help us.
You're the one who called.</i>

53:24.167 --> 53:26.292
<i>Don't let it hurt us.</i>

54:37.584 --> 54:38.459
Irene!

54:45.167 --> 54:46.209
Lucia!

54:48.376 --> 54:49.667
Lucia!

54:50.542 --> 54:52.001
Girls, wake up!

54:55.251 --> 54:56.167
Lucia!

55:00.584 --> 55:02.251
Vero! Vero!

55:03.917 --> 55:05.334
What are you doing?

55:06.084 --> 55:08.292
There was someone here
who wanted to hurt you.

55:08.459 --> 55:09.917
There's no one in here!

55:10.126 --> 55:11.876
We can't see it,
but it's here.

55:13.001 --> 55:14.084
Look!

55:14.376 --> 55:16.042
The amulets got burned.

55:16.542 --> 55:18.459
Take your mattresses, let's go.

55:18.667 --> 55:20.417
We're sleeping
together in the living room.

55:22.876 --> 55:24.417
I'm getting Antoñito.

55:32.251 --> 55:33.542
It's Benahavis.

55:52.084 --> 55:52.876
Vero.

55:54.459 --> 55:55.834
Go to sleep.

55:57.209 --> 55:59.376
Why were you choking me?

56:01.126 --> 56:02.501
I wasn't choking you.

56:02.667 --> 56:03.834
I was protecting you.

56:05.501 --> 56:06.709
From who?

56:07.126 --> 56:09.084
From something bad
that came inside the house.

56:09.584 --> 56:12.584
Who came inside the house?
Josefa?

56:12.751 --> 56:13.459
No.

56:14.334 --> 56:15.876
A being from the other side.

56:16.126 --> 56:17.376
An evil being.

56:18.626 --> 56:20.126
A ghost?

56:21.167 --> 56:22.751
A spirit?

56:22.917 --> 56:25.334
Don't be scared.
I'll protect you guys.

56:26.001 --> 56:27.584
Because you're the oldest?

56:27.751 --> 56:30.459
I'm glad you're my big sister.

56:30.667 --> 56:32.251
I'm glad you're my little sister.

56:32.376 --> 56:34.626
I'm not little. I'm in the middle,

56:34.792 --> 56:36.501
because Irene came out after.

56:37.709 --> 56:39.001
That's right.

56:39.459 --> 56:42.376
Go to sleep.
I'll keep watch.

56:47.292 --> 56:51.292
<i>- Sorry, what's going on?
- It's a festival in Benahavis!</i>

57:17.459 --> 57:18.917
<i>Veronica...</i>

58:49.334 --> 58:51.334
Vero, what's wrong?

58:59.084 --> 59:00.376
What's going on?

59:01.626 --> 59:02.667
It's back.

59:23.834 --> 59:25.001
What's this?

59:25.167 --> 59:26.876
- Mommy!
- Mommy!

59:27.084 --> 59:29.042
Can you tell me
what's going on here?

59:29.209 --> 59:32.459
- A bad man wanted to kill Lucia.
- Lucia, are you OK?

59:32.667 --> 59:34.042
Someone came in the house?

59:34.209 --> 59:36.292
No, they didn't come inside.
They were already here.

59:37.209 --> 59:39.542
- Vero!
- Nothing happened, Mom.

59:39.709 --> 59:42.417
But was someone
in the house or not?

59:42.626 --> 59:44.042
- No.
- Yes.

59:44.751 --> 59:47.501
- I'm calling the police.
- A spirit.

59:48.709 --> 59:50.751
- What?
- Yeah, a ghost.

59:51.292 --> 59:53.834
I didn't see it, but Vero did.

01:00:00.626 --> 01:00:03.501
- Were you watching scary movies again?
- Kind of.

01:00:04.209 --> 01:00:07.917
Don't worry, Mom.
Vero protects us from the spirit.

01:00:08.709 --> 01:00:10.501
Come on, let's pick
all this up and go to bed.

01:00:10.667 --> 01:00:11.709
And you go to your room!

01:00:11.917 --> 01:00:14.251
- But, Mom...
- No buts! Go to your room.

01:00:23.167 --> 01:00:24.751
What happened?

01:00:27.251 --> 01:00:29.042
- Tell me!
- Nothing.

01:00:32.209 --> 01:00:35.542
Your sisters are little
and they've got a huge imagination.

01:00:35.751 --> 01:00:39.334
Don't give them weird ideas
because then they can't sleep.

01:00:39.542 --> 01:00:41.501
How do you know
if they can or can't sleep?

01:00:41.709 --> 01:00:43.792
You're never home!
You don't know what goes on here.

01:00:44.542 --> 01:00:46.001
So what goes on here?

01:00:46.542 --> 01:00:48.417
- He wants to hurt us!
- Who?!

01:00:48.584 --> 01:00:51.251
I don't know! I'm the one
who called him with the ouija board.

01:00:51.417 --> 01:00:53.084
You played
the ouija board with your sisters?

01:00:53.501 --> 01:00:55.209
- No, with Rosa!
- But...

01:00:55.834 --> 01:00:58.084
Why are you playing
with such dark things?

01:00:58.251 --> 01:00:59.542
I wanted to talk to Dad.

01:01:01.126 --> 01:01:02.417
I know you don't care.

01:01:02.584 --> 01:01:04.834
You stuffed his pictures in a box
so you don't have to look at him.

01:01:05.001 --> 01:01:05.917
Don't say that!

01:01:06.459 --> 01:01:08.459
- I just wanted to talk to him!
- That's enough!

01:01:09.126 --> 01:01:12.126
You're reading too much of that stuff,
and it's having an effect on you.

01:01:12.626 --> 01:01:14.001
It's the truth.

01:01:14.917 --> 01:01:15.751
Vero...

01:01:17.251 --> 01:01:18.917
I need you to grow up.

01:01:19.126 --> 01:01:21.042
I need
to be able to count on you.

01:01:21.251 --> 01:01:22.459
Because I'm on my own.

01:01:22.709 --> 01:01:24.001
I'm the one on my own.

01:01:31.042 --> 01:01:33.834
You're not making it easy.
I'm really tired.

01:01:35.417 --> 01:01:37.417
We'll talk more tomorrow.

01:02:13.917 --> 01:02:17.042
<i>Nine, eight, seven,</i>

01:02:17.209 --> 01:02:20.584
<i>six, five, four,</i>

01:02:20.751 --> 01:02:24.334
<i>three, two, one!</i>

01:02:40.126 --> 01:02:43.292
- Vero!
- Vero, get up!

01:02:43.459 --> 01:02:44.959
- Wake up!
- Come on!

01:02:45.126 --> 01:02:47.209
- Come on!
- Get up!

01:02:47.376 --> 01:02:48.584
Let's go!

01:02:48.792 --> 01:02:50.334
Leave me alone, let me sleep!

01:02:50.501 --> 01:02:52.834
- We're hungry!
- Come on!

01:02:53.042 --> 01:02:54.459
We've got lots to do!

01:02:54.626 --> 01:02:57.209
We're hungry!

01:02:57.417 --> 01:02:59.126
- What are you doing?
- We're hungry!

01:02:59.292 --> 01:03:00.292
Get out, leave me alone!

01:03:00.459 --> 01:03:01.834
- Come on!
- Get up!

01:03:02.042 --> 01:03:04.792
Let's play a game.
Give me your arm.

01:03:05.042 --> 01:03:06.459
What are you talking about?

01:03:07.042 --> 01:03:08.209
What are you doing?

01:03:15.709 --> 01:03:16.792
Stop it!

01:03:19.542 --> 01:03:20.501
Stop!

01:03:20.751 --> 01:03:21.626
Don't!

01:03:22.001 --> 01:03:26.334
Mom! Mom!
Help me, Mom!

01:03:26.501 --> 01:03:28.584
Mom, help me!

01:03:28.792 --> 01:03:31.334
Mom, Mom!

01:03:31.501 --> 01:03:32.459
Mom, Mom...

01:03:32.626 --> 01:03:34.459
Mom!

01:03:37.001 --> 01:03:39.751
Leave me alone!
Mom!

01:03:43.542 --> 01:03:44.501
Mom!

01:03:45.251 --> 01:03:47.209
Mom, help me!

01:03:48.542 --> 01:03:49.417
Mom...

01:03:49.834 --> 01:03:51.084
Help me, Mom.

01:03:51.251 --> 01:03:52.501
- I can't hear you.
- Mom!

01:03:53.834 --> 01:03:56.209
I need you to grow up.

01:03:56.584 --> 01:03:57.667
Mom...

01:03:59.667 --> 01:04:01.001
Mom!

01:04:02.126 --> 01:04:03.167
Mom...!

01:04:04.751 --> 01:04:06.126
Mom!

01:04:07.501 --> 01:04:09.251
Mom!

01:04:19.501 --> 01:04:24.042
SATURDAY, JUNE 14TH, 1991

01:04:24.209 --> 01:04:27.292
10:40 A.M.

01:06:04.834 --> 01:06:08.042
- Did you make breakfast?
- Wait for the show to finish.

01:06:08.209 --> 01:06:10.042
Always the same,
I'm sick of you guys!

01:06:10.209 --> 01:06:11.667
Wait.

01:06:14.292 --> 01:06:16.251
Why's this book here?
You don't know how to read!

01:06:16.417 --> 01:06:18.626
Dad came to read it to me.

01:06:21.251 --> 01:06:22.084
Come again?

01:06:22.292 --> 01:06:24.501
Dad came to read it to me.

01:06:25.501 --> 01:06:28.209
- Dad came?
- He's coming back again tonight.

01:06:31.709 --> 01:06:32.917
What else did he say?

01:06:33.709 --> 01:06:36.209
That he's going
to take me to where he lives.

01:06:41.792 --> 01:06:44.626
Antoñito, listen to me.

01:06:45.042 --> 01:06:46.251
Listen.

01:06:46.542 --> 01:06:49.001
If he comes back,
don't listen to him, OK?

01:06:49.167 --> 01:06:50.584
Plug your ears.

01:06:50.834 --> 01:06:52.417
How do you
plug your ears?

01:06:53.459 --> 01:06:54.959
Great, like that.

01:06:55.542 --> 01:06:57.376
And you call me, OK?

01:06:57.542 --> 01:06:59.584
Yell my name really loud.

01:06:59.792 --> 01:07:00.542
OK?

01:07:44.209 --> 01:07:46.292
Kids, let's go!

01:08:04.376 --> 01:08:05.834
- Hi, Mom!
- Hey there!

01:08:06.084 --> 01:08:08.376
- What are you doing here?
- I need to go to Rosa's house.

01:08:08.584 --> 01:08:11.251
- Right now?
- For homework. Can they stay here?

01:08:11.417 --> 01:08:14.251
- Yeah. But come back soon!
- OK!

01:08:25.501 --> 01:08:28.167
They're right.
You're a crazy old woman.

01:08:29.001 --> 01:08:32.501
- Then why are you back?
- You can see the shadows, like me!

01:08:33.126 --> 01:08:35.792
Maybe we're both crazy.

01:08:37.834 --> 01:08:40.709
I've been trying
to stop seeing them for a long time.

01:08:43.042 --> 01:08:45.167
I did this
to myself, you know?

01:08:48.251 --> 01:08:51.501
Back then I didn't know
you don't need eyes to see.

01:08:52.001 --> 01:08:53.709
I don't know how
to protect myself from them.

01:08:53.834 --> 01:08:56.292
Amulets and crosses
don't work, they don't scare them!

01:08:56.459 --> 01:08:59.459
Crosses?
God has got nothing to do with it.

01:08:59.667 --> 01:09:01.126
Leave Him out of it.

01:09:01.334 --> 01:09:02.834
How can I make them go away?

01:09:04.001 --> 01:09:06.792
The same way they came in.

01:09:06.959 --> 01:09:10.126
They have to go back
through the door you opened.

01:09:10.376 --> 01:09:12.001
Bid them farewell.

01:09:13.376 --> 01:09:15.584
Then you'll have to destroy it.

01:09:16.126 --> 01:09:18.417
- Destroy the ouija board?
- No, the door!

01:09:19.417 --> 01:09:22.417
You have to do right
what you did wrong.

01:09:29.709 --> 01:09:30.917
What's wrong?

01:09:36.792 --> 01:09:38.376
Sister, again?

01:09:39.834 --> 01:09:42.126
I don't know how you can
get all the way down here.

01:09:43.001 --> 01:09:44.459
What are you
doing here on a Saturday?

01:09:45.751 --> 01:09:47.459
Sister was
helping me with a project.

01:09:47.792 --> 01:09:49.251
She's in no condition
to help anyone.

01:09:49.417 --> 01:09:50.334
This way, Sister.

01:09:56.084 --> 01:09:58.626
The answer is in the books.

01:09:58.834 --> 01:10:00.751
Look what great advice she gives.

01:10:02.126 --> 01:10:04.417
You have to do right
what you did wrong.

01:10:04.959 --> 01:10:06.126
Careful, Sister.

01:10:06.792 --> 01:10:08.834
"You have to do right
what you did wrong."

01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:14.834
"You have to do right
what you did wrong."

01:10:20.042 --> 01:10:21.626
"You have to do right
what you did wrong."

01:10:28.209 --> 01:10:30.667
"You should never
end a séance without..."

01:10:31.334 --> 01:10:33.626
"You should never
end a séance without..."

01:10:35.542 --> 01:10:36.626
Without what?

01:10:43.376 --> 01:10:44.959
<i>"You have to do right
what you did wrong."</i>

01:10:45.626 --> 01:10:47.417
<i>"You have to do right
what you did wrong."</i>

01:10:48.209 --> 01:10:49.709
<i>"You have to do right
what you did wrong."</i>

01:10:50.459 --> 01:10:51.792
<i>"You have to do right...“</i>

01:10:55.792 --> 01:10:57.501
<i>"You have to do right
what you did wrong."</i>

01:10:57.667 --> 01:10:59.292
<i>"You have to do right
what you did wrong."</i>

01:11:25.792 --> 01:11:28.834
"You should never
end a séance without saying goodbye.

01:11:29.084 --> 01:11:31.459
Whatever you don't say
goodbye to, stays with you.

01:11:31.667 --> 01:11:34.626
If it doesn't work,
try again another time."

01:11:40.126 --> 01:11:42.376
"Whatever you don't say
goodbye to, stays with you."

01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:55.084
<i>You have to do right
what you did wrong.</i>

01:11:55.251 --> 01:11:56.584
"You have to do right
what you did wrong."

01:11:56.751 --> 01:11:57.834
<i>The answer is in the books.</i>

01:11:58.042 --> 01:11:59.376
"You have to do right
what you did wrong."

01:11:59.584 --> 01:12:01.376
"Whatever you don't say
goodbye to, stays with you."

01:12:01.584 --> 01:12:03.501
<i>You have to do right
what you did wrong.</i>

01:12:03.667 --> 01:12:05.334
"Whatever you don't say
goodbye to, stays with you."

01:12:05.542 --> 01:12:06.834
"You have to do right
what you did wrong."

01:12:07.001 --> 01:12:07.917
"You have to do right
what you did wrong."

01:12:08.084 --> 01:12:10.459
"You should never
end a séance without saying goodbye."

01:12:10.667 --> 01:12:12.667
"You have to do right
what you did wrong."

01:12:24.209 --> 01:12:25.042
Hi.

01:12:27.251 --> 01:12:28.834
You made it.

01:12:29.042 --> 01:12:30.751
Rosa,
I know what we have to do.

01:12:31.959 --> 01:12:34.167
- Why'd you bring that?
- We have to do it again!

01:12:34.376 --> 01:12:35.834
- What?
- We didn't say goodbye!

01:12:36.042 --> 01:12:38.167
Whatever you don't say
goodbye to, stays with you.

01:12:38.334 --> 01:12:39.709
- What?
- It says so right here.

01:12:39.917 --> 01:12:41.709
- Cut the bullshit.
- We have to do it again!

01:12:41.917 --> 01:12:43.126
- Put it away!
- Let's go to your room.

01:12:43.292 --> 01:12:44.167
Where's Diana?

01:12:44.334 --> 01:12:45.751
- Calm down!
- Where's Diana?

01:12:45.917 --> 01:12:47.542
- Put it away!
- Diana!

01:12:47.751 --> 01:12:49.667
- Let's go to your room. Diana!
- Veronica!

01:12:49.834 --> 01:12:50.417
Diana!

01:12:50.626 --> 01:12:53.792
Where's Diana,
have you seen her?

01:12:54.459 --> 01:12:56.334
- Veronica!
- Diana!

01:12:58.459 --> 01:12:59.542
Have you seen Diana?

01:13:00.542 --> 01:13:02.209
Have you seen Diana?

01:13:02.376 --> 01:13:03.501
What are you talking about?

01:13:04.501 --> 01:13:05.917
Diana!
Have you seen Diana?

01:13:06.334 --> 01:13:08.042
- No.
- Who is Diana?

01:13:08.251 --> 01:13:09.251
Diana!

01:13:09.917 --> 01:13:12.167
- Diana!
- No, what's your problem?

01:13:13.501 --> 01:13:14.334
Diana!

01:13:16.959 --> 01:13:19.417
- You haven't seen her?
- Veronica, please.

01:13:20.167 --> 01:13:21.084
Diana!

01:13:22.792 --> 01:13:23.626
Diana!

01:13:24.001 --> 01:13:24.792
Diana.

01:13:26.376 --> 01:13:27.501
Diana, come here.

01:13:27.751 --> 01:13:30.334
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Come on, we have to do it.

01:13:30.501 --> 01:13:32.709
- Do what?
- The three of us together.

01:13:32.834 --> 01:13:34.792
- Let me go, you're crazy!
- Come on, Diana!

01:13:34.959 --> 01:13:36.834
- Leave me alone!
- Let go of me!

01:13:37.001 --> 01:13:40.792
- Kicking you the hell out!
- Come on, Diana, Rosa!

01:13:40.959 --> 01:13:43.626
Rosa! Rosa!

01:13:49.917 --> 01:13:51.667
Rosa,
we have to do it again.

01:13:52.126 --> 01:13:56.376
- You don't remember, do you?
- Remember what?

01:13:59.751 --> 01:14:01.376
You whispered
something to me the other day.

01:14:01.542 --> 01:14:02.709
What did I say?

01:14:02.834 --> 01:14:04.292
Tell me, Rosa!

01:14:05.834 --> 01:14:07.334
You said
you were going to die today.

01:14:08.667 --> 01:14:11.292
- What?
- Vero, I'm sorry.

01:14:11.459 --> 01:14:14.042
- What did you say?
- We were scared, we didn't...

01:14:14.792 --> 01:14:16.001
What's that?

01:14:18.376 --> 01:14:20.209
Did you bite yourself?

01:14:20.542 --> 01:14:22.501
No, Rosa. I didn't.

01:14:26.334 --> 01:14:28.251
Come on, let's go.

01:14:32.334 --> 01:14:33.501
Rosa!

01:14:35.042 --> 01:14:36.209
Rosa!

01:14:37.334 --> 01:14:38.459
Rosa!

01:15:41.042 --> 01:15:41.834
Mom!

01:15:42.042 --> 01:15:44.292
Hey, you're in the way!

01:15:46.667 --> 01:15:48.126
Can we go home now?

01:15:48.292 --> 01:15:49.126
Wait.

01:15:49.292 --> 01:15:50.042
Mom!

01:15:51.292 --> 01:15:52.834
Where were you all day?

01:15:53.042 --> 01:15:55.709
Take the kids,
they can't stay here forever!

01:15:57.126 --> 01:15:59.709
Give me the leftovers for the kids.
Coming!

01:16:00.001 --> 01:16:01.667
This is always dirty.

01:16:02.084 --> 01:16:03.709
Because you always get it dirty.

01:16:03.834 --> 01:16:05.001
Mom!

01:16:06.584 --> 01:16:07.542
Mom!

01:16:07.709 --> 01:16:08.584
What?

01:16:08.792 --> 01:16:10.001
Mom, close the bar.

01:16:10.167 --> 01:16:12.042
Right now,
let's all go somewhere.

01:16:13.167 --> 01:16:14.501
What are you talking about?

01:16:14.667 --> 01:16:16.417
Mom, it doesn't
come when you're home.

01:16:20.042 --> 01:16:21.376
Here we go again...

01:16:21.834 --> 01:16:26.459
I'd love to close
and eat with you, but I can't.

01:16:26.709 --> 01:16:28.459
- Ana!
- Coming.

01:16:31.834 --> 01:16:33.167
Look...

01:16:34.292 --> 01:16:36.001
Want to go
to the park tomorrow?

01:16:36.167 --> 01:16:37.834
To spend the day, like before.

01:16:38.334 --> 01:16:40.709
What do you think?
I'll make sandwiches to eat there.

01:16:40.917 --> 01:16:41.751
You want to?

01:16:42.042 --> 01:16:44.126
Ana, the leftovers!

01:16:45.626 --> 01:16:46.667
You grab them.

01:16:49.376 --> 01:16:50.709
Kids, let's go.

01:16:50.834 --> 01:16:52.251
Finally!

01:16:52.834 --> 01:16:54.709
- Let's go.
- Are we going home?

01:16:54.834 --> 01:16:56.292
Let's go, sweetheart.

01:16:58.167 --> 01:16:59.459
Veronica!

01:17:01.292 --> 01:17:02.417
Veronica!

01:17:05.959 --> 01:17:07.251
Goal!

01:17:08.042 --> 01:17:11.501
<i>Pedro Riesco scored.
After Ribera's mistake,</i>

01:17:11.667 --> 01:17:13.084
<i>the first goal
in the game for the team...</i>

01:17:16.667 --> 01:17:18.667
<i>You have to do right
what you did wrong.</i>

01:18:15.751 --> 01:18:17.459
- We're going to play a game.
- What game?

01:18:19.584 --> 01:18:22.626
We're going to play a game
where you have to do what I say.

01:18:22.792 --> 01:18:24.834
This game sucks.

01:18:25.501 --> 01:18:27.792
Grab the candles
in the top drawer.

01:18:29.834 --> 01:18:33.626
Antoñito,
draw this on the hallway walls.

01:18:33.792 --> 01:18:34.917
- OK!
- Great.

01:18:36.292 --> 01:18:38.251
I get to draw on the wall.

01:18:39.001 --> 01:18:42.542
Mom's going to ground you
until you're at least 40.

01:18:43.001 --> 01:18:45.709
Move the furniture.
We need to have space.

01:18:48.334 --> 01:18:56.209
SATURDAY, JUNE 14TH, 1991
23:45

01:19:16.709 --> 01:19:18.876
VIKING SYMBOLS OF PROTECTION

01:19:23.417 --> 01:19:28.792
SYMBOLS OF INVOCATION

01:20:29.417 --> 01:20:31.251
Not you.
Just the three of us.

01:20:31.417 --> 01:20:32.834
Sit over there.

01:20:36.126 --> 01:20:38.542
You guys close your eyes.

01:20:45.292 --> 01:20:47.792
Is anyone here with us?

01:20:55.917 --> 01:20:57.792
Is there
anyone here with us?

01:21:00.542 --> 01:21:02.334
Who's here with us?

01:21:15.917 --> 01:21:17.209
Are you here?

01:21:22.876 --> 01:21:23.959
Yes.

01:21:24.251 --> 01:21:26.751
We're here
to say goodbye to you.

01:21:29.001 --> 01:21:30.667
You need to leave this place.

01:21:32.709 --> 01:21:33.459
No.

01:21:33.792 --> 01:21:35.959
We command you!
Repeat after me, girls.

01:21:36.167 --> 01:21:37.792
We command you!

01:21:40.834 --> 01:21:42.542
This isn't your house!

01:21:43.167 --> 01:21:44.376
Leave!

01:21:44.751 --> 01:21:46.251
This isn't your house!

01:21:48.126 --> 01:21:49.542
Leave!

01:21:49.709 --> 01:21:51.417
This isn't your house!

01:21:57.334 --> 01:22:00.042
"To properly conclude the séance
and bid farewell,

01:22:00.251 --> 01:22:03.542
participants should sing
a mantra or a soft song."

01:22:05.209 --> 01:22:08.209
- We didn't do that, either.
- What's a mantra?

01:22:09.834 --> 01:22:10.834
I don't know.

01:22:11.042 --> 01:22:13.167
But it says
a soft song works, too.

01:22:13.376 --> 01:22:14.292
Which one?

01:22:14.542 --> 01:22:16.001
One all three of us know.

01:22:16.709 --> 01:22:17.876
Centella.

01:22:22.626 --> 01:22:26.917
<i>Centella gives me time to enjoy...</i>

01:22:27.126 --> 01:22:30.459
<i>Centella, Centella.</i>

01:22:31.667 --> 01:22:36.251
<i>Centella gives me time to enjoy...</i>

01:22:36.417 --> 01:22:37.376
What is that?

01:22:40.459 --> 01:22:43.917
<i>Centella, Centella.</i>

01:22:44.084 --> 01:22:48.667
<i>Time to myself, time for life,</i>

01:22:49.167 --> 01:22:53.667
<i>Centella gives me time to enjoy...</i>

01:22:53.834 --> 01:22:57.334
<i>Centella, Centella.</i>

01:22:57.542 --> 01:23:00.042
Girls, keep going.
We can't stop.

01:23:00.209 --> 01:23:02.001
<i>Time for life...</i>

01:23:02.667 --> 01:23:07.334

<i>Centella,
Centella, time to myself...</i>

01:23:29.542 --> 01:23:31.709
Come on,
don't stop!

01:23:33.626 --> 01:23:38.376
<i>Centella gives me time to enjoy...</i>

01:23:38.542 --> 01:23:42.459
<i>Centella, Centella.</i>

01:23:44.334 --> 01:23:46.126
Gross, it stinks.

01:23:47.876 --> 01:23:50.751
<i>...time to enjoy, Centella, Centella.</i>

01:23:50.917 --> 01:23:53.001
Lucia, don't stop.

01:23:56.167 --> 01:24:04.959
<i>Centella gives me time to enjoy...
Centella, Centella.</i>

01:24:08.084 --> 01:24:09.167
Keep singing!

01:24:09.376 --> 01:24:10.751
Don't stop singing!

01:24:41.334 --> 01:24:43.292
Wait here.

01:24:49.001 --> 01:24:49.876
Don't leave.

01:27:16.709 --> 01:27:17.751
He's here!

01:27:23.792 --> 01:27:26.709
- <i>This is the police.</i>
- Help! Help, please!

01:27:26.876 --> 01:27:29.626
<i>Please, calm down
so I can understand you.</i>

01:27:29.751 --> 01:27:33.167
- <i>What happened?</i>
- Please, help us! He's inside!

01:27:33.376 --> 01:27:34.667
He's inside!

01:27:34.876 --> 01:27:36.167
<i>There's someone in the house?</i>

01:27:36.626 --> 01:27:39.876
<i>Calm down. We're going to send someone
right away. I need your address.</i>

01:27:40.084 --> 01:27:42.251

01:30:25.751 --> 01:30:27.542

01:31:10.126 --> 01:31:13.126
Mom! Mom! Mom!

01:31:14.459 --> 01:31:17.251
What happened? What happened?

01:31:18.001 --> 01:31:20.251
Where's Antoñito,
where's Vero?

01:31:21.126 --> 01:31:22.542
Where's Vero?

No, no, no, no.

01:33:38.667 --> 01:33:40.042
<i>If he comes back,</i>

01:33:40.209 --> 01:33:41.209
don't listen to him, OK?

01:33:41.376 --> 01:33:42.626
Plug your ears.

01:33:42.876 --> 01:33:44.667
And you call me, OK?

01:33:44.834 --> 01:33:46.626
Yell my name really loud.

01:33:46.751 --> 01:33:49.084
Vero, Vero, Vero...

01:33:49.292 --> 01:33:52.751
Vero, Vero, Vero...

01:34:03.667 --> 01:34:05.334
<i>You have siblings, don't you?</i>

01:34:05.667 --> 01:34:07.751
<i>You'll have to protect them.</i>

01:34:09.167 --> 01:34:12.042
<i>Don't worry, Mom.
Vero protects us from the spirit.</i>

01:34:12.251 --> 01:34:15.459
<i>You're reading too much of that stuff,
and it's having an effect on you.</i>

01:34:17.542 --> 01:34:19.209
<i>Vero! Vero!</i>

01:34:19.876 --> 01:34:21.209
What are you doing?

01:34:21.376 --> 01:34:22.917
We can't see it,
but it's here.

01:34:23.667 --> 01:34:25.167
Why were you choking me?

01:34:25.334 --> 01:34:27.417
<i>I wasn't choking you.</i>

01:34:27.626 --> 01:34:29.209
<i>I was protecting you.</i>

01:34:29.376 --> 01:34:30.751
- Did you touch the faucet?
- I didn't do anything.

01:34:31.001 --> 01:34:32.459
Antoñito!

01:34:32.751 --> 01:34:35.126
<i>I'm sorry I put the water on so hot.</i>

01:34:36.167 --> 01:34:37.292
Did you move it?

01:34:37.459 --> 01:34:39.042
Did you bite yourself?

01:34:39.209 --> 01:34:40.834
It wasn't you.

01:34:44.042 --> 01:34:45.876
<i>Someone answered your call.</i>

01:34:47.126 --> 01:34:48.917
<i>And now walks with you.</i>

01:34:49.209 --> 01:34:51.334
<i>If it isn't my Dad,
then who is it?</i>

01:35:01.459 --> 01:35:02.709
It's me.

01:35:05.876 --> 01:35:07.042
It's me.

01:35:14.542 --> 01:35:15.667
It's me.

01:35:17.709 --> 01:35:18.876

Buddy, come here. It's OK.

Come with me. That's it.

01:36:35.042 --> 01:36:36.792
- Where's Vero?
- Vero? She's fine.

01:36:36.959 --> 01:36:42.751
Pellicer, send the medics up.
I repeat, send the medics up.

01:37:13.084 --> 01:37:15.542
Vero! Vero!
