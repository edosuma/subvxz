00:01.571 --> 00:02.538
Previously on "the shield"...

00:02.473 --> 00:03.140
guillermo beltran ...

00:03.150 --> 00:03.707
The guerrero drug cartel

00:03.874 --> 00:04.441
head of security.

00:04.451 --> 00:05.142
The goal is getting him

00:05.377 --> 00:06.210
to trust you to the point

00:06.220 --> 00:06.877
where you have access to

00:06.887 --> 00:07.544
the cartel's inner workings.

00:07.554 --> 00:08.044
I've arranged a meet and

00:08.054 --> 00:08.679
greet with you and the

00:09.915 --> 00:10.748
black board of directors.

00:10.848 --> 00:11.615
I don't meet and greet.

00:11.816 --> 00:12.216
I'd be happy

00:12.751 --> 00:13.384
to negotiate terms.

00:13.394 --> 00:13.951
Shane vendrell hired you

00:15.220 --> 00:15.787
to kill gardocki?

00:15.797 --> 00:16.387
There's a reward for anyone

00:17.356 --> 00:18.023
who can deliver him.

00:18.033 --> 00:18.623
Your cop buddy's paying 10 g's

00:19.825 --> 00:20.458
for your head, ese.

00:20.468 --> 00:20.891
You got almost 100 grand

00:21.560 --> 00:21.860
in there.

00:21.870 --> 00:22.393
That's more than enough

00:22.795 --> 00:23.328
to keep walking.

00:23.338 --> 00:23.962
Since you caused us to lore

00:25.665 --> 00:26.398
all of our cash today,

00:26.408 --> 00:27.065
you're gonna replace it.

00:27.075 --> 00:27.599
My husband's giving vic

00:29.268 --> 00:29.768
a 5:00 deadline

00:29.769 --> 00:30.602
to come up with $100,000.

00:30.612 --> 00:31.203
Corrine is supposed to

00:32.372 --> 00:33.172
hand the money to shane.

00:33.182 --> 00:33.572
we just walked vic

00:34.473 --> 00:34.873
into a bust.

00:34.974 --> 00:35.441
code red.

00:36.710 --> 00:37.310
There's a package.

00:37.710 --> 00:38.377
You know what to do.

00:38.678 --> 00:38.978
Ronnie is

00:40.614 --> 00:41.380
his goddamn errand boy.

00:41.481 --> 00:41.948
We haven't got

00:42.516 --> 00:43.216
the real bastard yet.

00:43.226 --> 00:43.950
what if vic figured out

00:44.886 --> 00:45.819
that I was working with you?

00:45.829 --> 00:46.386
What's he gonna do to me

00:46.954 --> 00:47.554
when he finds out?

00:47.564 --> 00:48.122
What do you think of

00:48.132 --> 00:48.789
shane taking a pass on

00:49.723 --> 00:50.490
that bag of free money?

00:50.591 --> 00:50.991
Shane didn't

00:51.326 --> 00:51.792
show up today?

00:51.802 --> 00:52.325
It's time for me to pull my guy

00:53.561 --> 00:54.095
into this thing.

00:54.229 --> 00:54.629
Vic, I can't

00:54.662 --> 00:55.195
say yes to that.

00:55.262 --> 00:55.729
That's the way

00:55.964 --> 00:56.464
it's got to be!

00:56.474 --> 00:56.998
I'm trying to set us up

00:57.565 --> 00:58.098
with fed badges.

00:58.633 --> 00:59.100
I'm gonna run.

01:01.837 --> 01:02.704
If I fail, we'll both run.

01:04.873 --> 01:05.473
hey, hold up.

01:06.275 --> 01:06.541
Hold up.

How you doin'?

01:22.068 --> 01:22.625
You need something?

01:22.692 --> 01:23.159
I need to take

01:24.028 --> 01:24.694
some people's money.

01:27.698 --> 01:28.465
Omaha hi-lo is my game.

01:32.770 --> 01:33.237
Appreciate it.

01:55.628 --> 01:56.495
Daddy's coming back, baby.

01:56.505 --> 01:56.996
He's just getting us

02:03.537 --> 02:04.104
some money, okay?

02:15.916 --> 02:16.082
Trap!

02:16.985 --> 02:17.518
Hey h-hey, trap!

02:17.528 --> 02:18.152
You put your hand on me again,

02:20.121 --> 02:20.821
you're gonna lose it.

02:21.355 --> 02:22.089
You don't remember me?

02:23.491 --> 02:23.791
Oh, yeah.

02:23.859 --> 02:24.425
Yeah, um...sorry,

02:25.660 --> 02:26.527
I burnt too many of these.

02:26.695 --> 02:27.062
What is it?

02:27.196 --> 02:27.596
It's biddle.

02:28.030 --> 02:28.563
Marty's brother.

02:28.573 --> 02:29.297
Right. Right. Marty's ...

02:31.267 --> 02:32.300
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Yeah.

02:32.334 --> 02:32.901
It's feeling like

02:33.136 --> 02:33.769
one of those nights

02:33.779 --> 02:34.302
the tables are just itching

02:34.804 --> 02:35.470
to clear my pockets.

02:35.571 --> 02:36.138
I think I'm gonna

02:36.873 --> 02:37.807
find my old lady, get drunk,

02:39.108 --> 02:39.775
hold on to my money.

02:40.342 --> 02:40.709
Whoa, wait!

02:40.843 --> 02:41.277
Chuck's here.

02:42.245 --> 02:42.945
He'd want to see you.

02:43.145 --> 02:43.278
who?

02:43.980 --> 02:44.246
Come on.

02:45.548 --> 02:45.782
Oh! Oh!

02:49.420 --> 02:50.253
Damn, that son of a bitch

02:52.624 --> 02:53.557
is having a hell of a night!

02:53.591 --> 02:54.124
Hey, maybe he'll

02:54.858 --> 02:55.425
change your luck.

03:01.932 --> 03:02.566
Yeah, maybe he can.

03:03.034 --> 03:03.234
Chuck!

03:05.204 --> 03:06.104
Look who came back in town.

03:08.707 --> 03:08.974
No shit.

03:10.242 --> 03:10.975
It's been a long time.

03:11.576 --> 03:11.743
Yeah.

03:11.753 --> 03:12.143
So long he didn't

03:13.079 --> 03:13.479
remember me.

03:13.489 --> 03:13.845
We got some catching up

03:15.815 --> 03:16.015
to do!

03:16.783 --> 03:17.483
Party's at our place.

03:18.284 --> 03:19.117
As long as you're buying.

03:35.536 --> 03:36.103
Ahh, god damn it.

03:37.839 --> 03:38.839
It's gonna be my girl calling.

03:38.839 --> 03:39.372
Tell her to keep

03:40.040 --> 03:40.574
her legs spread.

03:40.574 --> 03:41.041
You'll be home

03:42.143 --> 03:42.509
eventually.

03:43.211 --> 03:43.544
Hey, baby.

03:43.554 --> 03:44.078
there's two

03:44.780 --> 03:45.280
of them, shane.

03:45.290 --> 03:45.813
How are you gonna

03:46.147 --> 03:46.647
take them both?

03:46.714 --> 03:47.048
I told you

03:47.049 --> 03:47.582
I was going out.

03:48.317 --> 03:48.983
Where are you going?

03:48.993 --> 03:49.551
I don't know what time

03:51.420 --> 03:52.020
i'm gonna be home.

03:52.021 --> 03:52.687
What about your gun?

03:52.697 --> 03:53.288
Yeah, well, um, I'll see

03:54.890 --> 03:55.524
you when I see you.

03:55.658 --> 03:56.091
Okay, I'll be

04:00.997 --> 04:01.563
right behind you.

04:08.004 --> 04:08.471
oh!

04:08.481 --> 04:08.971
Cut a few more, b.

04:10.507 --> 04:10.974
It's my night!

04:17.880 --> 04:18.748
And our buddy trap's back.

04:25.223 --> 04:25.390
Um...

04:25.423 --> 04:25.890
You know what,

04:26.958 --> 04:27.425
I think, uh...

04:27.435 --> 04:28.026
I think I'm gonna step out

04:29.361 --> 04:30.028
of here for a minute

04:30.195 --> 04:30.795
and grab some air.

04:30.805 --> 04:31.396
Your head's the last thing

04:31.964 --> 04:32.597
needs to get clear.

04:32.607 --> 04:33.231
You been lagging behind us.

04:34.233 --> 04:34.967
It's time to catch up.

04:34.977 --> 04:35.233
Just take me a second,

04:35.934 --> 04:36.068
man.

04:36.078 --> 04:36.568
hey, I thought you came here

04:38.570 --> 04:39.037
to party, man!

04:39.038 --> 04:39.671
Come on.

04:39.681 --> 04:40.339
There's plenty of time

04:41.941 --> 04:42.841
to get air after that, huh?

04:45.077 --> 04:45.344
Come on.

04:46.212 --> 04:46.545
Set it up!

04:47.613 --> 04:48.080
Yeah, come on.

04:51.351 --> 04:51.818
Your bad self.

05:02.029 --> 05:02.496
Not bad, yeah?

05:04.499 --> 05:05.032
Yeah. Hell yeah.

05:06.233 --> 05:06.466
So, uh,

05:08.302 --> 05:08.902
have another, huh?

05:10.205 --> 05:10.838
Come on.

05:12.440 --> 05:12.774
All right.

05:19.882 --> 05:20.482
There we go, trap!

05:21.784 --> 05:22.351
Now it's a party!

05:22.361 --> 05:22.785
Damn, I'm gonna need

05:25.254 --> 05:25.554
that air.

05:26.222 --> 05:26.922
Ahh. Dude, what'd you

05:29.292 --> 05:29.758
cut that with?

05:31.193 --> 05:31.393
Speed.

05:34.331 --> 05:34.531
Uh-oh.

05:34.565 --> 05:35.298
You seen marty lately?

05:35.833 --> 05:36.066
Uh, no.

05:37.368 --> 05:38.368
No, man, I haven't seen marty.

05:39.469 --> 05:39.936
How's he been?

05:40.271 --> 05:40.671
Not so good.

05:42.707 --> 05:43.774
The goddamn mexicans killed him.

05:44.242 --> 05:44.575
What, man?

05:44.585 --> 05:45.309
Yeah, they got him in chino,

05:46.912 --> 05:47.979
right in the middle of the yard.

05:49.281 --> 05:50.081
Right where you put him,

05:51.316 --> 05:51.883
goddamn vice cop.

05:54.252 --> 05:54.552
Hey, man.

05:54.562 --> 05:55.186
What are you talking about, man?

05:56.855 --> 05:57.555
I
- I'm not a cop, man.

06:33.227 --> 06:33.427
Shane!

06:35.096 --> 06:35.262
Mara!

06:35.997 --> 06:36.664
Chuck, I'm sleeping!

06:43.571 --> 06:43.738
Mara!

06:44.940 --> 06:45.107
Whoa.

06:50.847 --> 06:51.213
Oh, my god.

06:57.087 --> 06:57.654
Aah, my shoulder!

07:05.963 --> 07:06.596
Baby? Are you okay?

07:07.798 --> 07:08.231
Are you okay?

07:09.066 --> 07:09.766
It's okay. I'm sorry.

07:09.776 --> 07:10.200
Come here, baby.

07:11.202 --> 07:11.535
Come here.

07:15.407 --> 07:15.674
Hang on.

07:29.655 --> 07:29.955
Stand up.

07:29.965 --> 07:30.522
Give me the money!

07:33.326 --> 07:33.926
Give me the money!

07:37.364 --> 07:37.564
Shane!

07:41.502 --> 07:42.235
Let's get out of here!

07:53.152 --> 07:58.085
ran into a guy I hadn't seen
in ages. We started drinking.

07:58.786 --> 07:59.386
What was his name?

08:00.355 --> 08:00.522
Trap.

08:01.590 --> 08:02.390
After the bar shut down,

08:02.424 --> 08:02.991
we came back here

08:04.193 --> 08:04.993
to keep the party going.

08:04.994 --> 08:05.827
We're here about an hour,

08:05.837 --> 08:06.394
and this girl comes in

08:07.763 --> 08:08.363
and starts firing.

08:08.764 --> 08:09.198
Is this trap?

08:09.208 --> 08:09.698
Yeah, that's the asshole.

08:11.233 --> 08:11.666
Dude's a cop?

08:11.767 --> 08:12.200
you see

08:13.403 --> 08:14.069
what he was driving?

08:15.905 --> 08:16.272
Red t-bird.

08:19.108 --> 08:19.875
All right, stop moving.

08:20.009 --> 08:20.409
If you broke

08:20.677 --> 08:21.210
your collarbone,

08:21.220 --> 08:21.878
it could splinter off

08:24.114 --> 08:25.047
and pierce your heart, okay?

08:26.317 --> 08:26.650
Lean back.

08:31.589 --> 08:32.022
I didn't mean

08:33.457 --> 08:33.890
to shoot her.

08:33.900 --> 08:34.457
I thought you were

08:35.125 --> 08:35.692
in trouble, baby.

08:35.793 --> 08:36.126
It's okay.

08:37.095 --> 08:37.428
It's okay.

08:39.865 --> 08:40.298
No, it's not.

08:40.899 --> 08:41.332
I killed her.

08:41.342 --> 08:41.899
Baby, if you hadn't have

08:43.302 --> 08:44.001
come in when you did,

08:44.403 --> 08:45.269
they would have killed me.

08:45.671 --> 08:46.271
Let me see your ...

08:46.505 --> 08:47.238
Oh, god!

08:47.248 --> 08:47.805
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

08:48.841 --> 08:49.407
I'm really sorry.

08:49.417 --> 08:49.941
Even ... there's nothing

08:51.143 --> 08:51.643
I can do, baby.

08:51.977 --> 08:52.210
Even if

08:52.378 --> 08:53.111
we went to the doctor,

08:53.121 --> 08:53.645
all they would do

08:54.180 --> 08:54.847
is put it in a sling

08:54.857 --> 08:55.380
and then try to keep you

08:56.249 --> 08:56.749
from moving it.

08:56.759 --> 08:57.183
Give me something

08:57.450 --> 08:57.883
for the pain.

08:57.893 --> 08:58.551
The baby ... we don't know

09:00.020 --> 09:00.920
what pills could do to her.

09:01.088 --> 09:01.588
Please help me.

09:03.423 --> 09:04.356
I'll just take a little bit.

09:05.225 --> 09:05.392
Okay.

09:06.726 --> 09:07.059
I promise.

09:12.242 --> 09:12.733
daddy, could you

09:13.201 --> 09:13.634
play with me?

09:13.644 --> 09:14.068
What happened to you

09:15.169 --> 09:15.469
in there?

09:15.479 --> 09:15.936
Hold on, buddy.

09:16.671 --> 09:17.037
They, uh...

09:17.047 --> 09:17.604
They made me do some coke

09:19.306 --> 09:19.873
mixed with speed.

09:20.241 --> 09:20.441
It was

09:21.143 --> 09:21.876
some real strong shit.

09:22.310 --> 09:22.743
Jesus, shane.

09:22.843 --> 09:23.177
It's okay.

09:24.312 --> 09:24.745
I'm okay now.

09:25.013 --> 09:25.313
I'm gonna

09:27.183 --> 09:27.883
go get us some, uh...

09:28.483 --> 09:29.016
...some medicine

09:31.887 --> 09:32.354
and some food,

09:32.364 --> 09:32.654
and I will be right back,

09:34.790 --> 09:34.957
okay?

09:41.831 --> 09:42.365
What's going on?

09:42.375 --> 09:43.032
Sounds like a homicide

09:43.801 --> 09:44.701
took place late last night.

09:44.711 --> 09:45.100
Suspects are a caucasian couple,

09:46.602 --> 09:46.869
mid-30s.

09:46.870 --> 09:47.403
A pregnant woman

09:48.105 --> 09:48.638
was the shooter.

09:48.838 --> 09:49.205
Oh, christ.

09:49.215 --> 09:49.639
House is owned by

09:49.707 --> 09:50.307
the brother of one

09:51.442 --> 09:52.376
of shane's old vice collars.

09:52.386 --> 09:53.009
Guy's been put up three times

09:54.780 --> 09:55.646
on illegal gambling beefs.

09:55.656 --> 09:56.313
Shane probably thought he could

09:57.449 --> 09:58.249
take some money off him.

09:58.259 --> 09:58.815
Yeah, whatever the plan was,

09:59.350 --> 09:59.917
it went sideways.

09:59.927 --> 10:00.517
Witness says says that mara

10:01.253 --> 10:02.020
left the scene injured.

10:02.030 --> 10:02.453
They're coming off

10:03.521 --> 10:03.854
the rails.

10:03.888 --> 10:04.455
Yeah, and putting

10:05.156 --> 10:05.790
you and me on them.

10:05.824 --> 10:06.491
We got to get i.c.e.

10:08.394 --> 10:09.394
To start cutting us deals now.

10:09.729 --> 10:10.462
Nah, they won't do it.

10:10.472 --> 10:10.963
Not without a big, juicy

10:12.064 --> 10:12.531
takedown apple

10:12.541 --> 10:13.065
ready to be plucked

10:13.933 --> 10:14.600
off the cartel tree.

10:14.610 --> 10:15.233
What's the soonest we can get

10:15.702 --> 10:16.535
beltran to make his move?

10:16.545 --> 10:17.069
He doesn't plan on

10:17.103 --> 10:17.736
importing his drugs

10:19.506 --> 10:20.272
for another three days.

10:20.282 --> 10:20.873
Shane's not gonna keep it

10:22.475 --> 10:23.108
together that long.

10:23.410 --> 10:23.910
Not after this.

10:23.920 --> 10:24.644
Well, if we can get beltran

10:25.646 --> 10:26.546
to move his drugs tomorrow,

10:26.713 --> 10:27.080
then we can

10:27.648 --> 10:28.181
guarantee i.c.e.

10:28.415 --> 10:28.849
A cartel bust

10:29.817 --> 10:30.584
in the next 24 hours ...

10:30.585 --> 10:31.485
Put enough pressure on them

10:31.495 --> 10:31.952
to draft our immunity deals

10:33.787 --> 10:34.154
by tonight.

10:34.164 --> 10:34.788
How do we get beltran

10:37.792 --> 10:38.626
to move up his timetable?

10:38.636 --> 10:39.059
Shipment's got to be

10:40.495 --> 10:40.795
moved up.

10:40.805 --> 10:41.462
I don't need you to tell me

10:42.264 --> 10:43.030
how to move my product.

10:43.040 --> 10:43.698
Some of the gangs got mouthy

10:44.967 --> 10:45.867
about a shipment coming in.

10:45.877 --> 10:46.401
Cops have picked up

10:46.902 --> 10:47.402
on the chatter.

10:47.412 --> 10:47.836
My captain got a memo

10:48.170 --> 10:48.603
this morning.

10:48.613 --> 10:49.237
"be on the lookout for a big

10:50.940 --> 10:51.807
drug score in three days."

10:51.817 --> 10:52.307
I thought you had the blacks

10:53.075 --> 10:53.542
under control.

10:53.552 --> 10:54.142
I'm controlling the damage,

10:55.678 --> 10:56.478
and I'm saving your ass.

10:56.488 --> 10:56.978
And I brought you

10:58.314 --> 10:58.748
the solution.

10:58.758 --> 10:59.448
There's a presidential motorcade

11:00.350 --> 11:01.217
coming into town tomorrow,

11:01.227 --> 11:01.851
and that's gonna tie up

11:03.053 --> 11:03.786
every cop in the city.

11:03.796 --> 11:04.186
President lands at l.a.x.

11:05.455 --> 11:05.855
At 5:00 p.m.

11:05.865 --> 11:06.489
All extra eyes and hands will be

11:07.824 --> 11:08.691
stationed west of the 405.

11:08.725 --> 11:09.158
All that heat

11:09.960 --> 11:10.360
and manpower

11:10.370 --> 11:11.127
are focused on moving him

11:12.230 --> 11:13.196
safely through the west side.

11:13.206 --> 11:13.830
You'll move your weight

11:15.266 --> 11:15.966
through the east side

11:17.368 --> 11:18.068
unnoticed, untouched.

11:18.078 --> 11:18.669
Tomorrow ... two days ahead

11:23.808 --> 11:24.475
of the police intel.

11:26.679 --> 11:27.645
I presume that the shipment's

11:29.215 --> 11:29.948
coming in from mexico,

11:30.115 --> 11:30.549
so you better

11:31.817 --> 11:32.450
get it on the road.

11:35.722 --> 11:36.655
It's already in los angeles.

11:37.289 --> 11:37.922
Even better. Where?

11:38.156 --> 11:38.490
Sitting in

11:40.426 --> 11:40.992
a port container.

11:41.026 --> 11:41.493
But my customs

11:42.261 --> 11:42.728
rubber stamper

11:42.738 --> 11:43.161
isn't scheduled to work

11:44.396 --> 11:44.830
for two days.

11:44.830 --> 11:45.297
Work schedules

11:49.336 --> 11:49.702
can change.

11:49.712 --> 11:50.536
What if we could guarantee

11:50.546 --> 11:51.003
that the guy scheduled

11:52.306 --> 11:52.839
to work tomorrow

11:53.240 --> 11:54.007
was gonna call in sick?

11:54.017 --> 11:54.607
Could you get your guy there

11:55.409 --> 11:56.042
to stamp the drugs,

11:56.243 --> 11:56.643
help us make

11:57.377 --> 11:58.044
our window tomorrow?

11:58.054 --> 11:58.411
I'll call him

11:58.445 --> 11:58.779
right now.

12:00.047 --> 12:00.247
Great.

12:00.257 --> 12:00.981
We'll meet back here at midnight

12:01.750 --> 12:02.650
to go over the specifics ...

12:02.660 --> 12:03.150
How to run distribution

12:06.354 --> 12:06.787
to the gangs.

12:06.854 --> 12:07.454
I got to warn you.

12:07.464 --> 12:08.055
Things have changed

12:09.124 --> 12:09.924
a little bit around here

12:09.934 --> 12:10.625
the last couple of days.

12:10.792 --> 12:11.159
Sounds like

12:11.659 --> 12:12.159
for the better.

12:12.327 --> 12:12.694
Hey, dutch.

12:13.596 --> 12:14.096
We got to talk.

12:14.106 --> 12:14.729
Did you say hi to danny?

12:15.230 --> 12:15.363
hey.

12:15.564 --> 12:16.264
I need you for a sec.

12:16.274 --> 12:16.698
I better tell claudette

12:18.967 --> 12:19.267
i'm back.

12:19.970 --> 12:20.136
Okay.

12:20.136 --> 12:20.869
Look, I know it's been

12:21.804 --> 12:22.838
rough waters between us lately,

12:23.072 --> 12:23.706
but I need a favor.

12:23.716 --> 12:24.407
The department is threatening

12:25.242 --> 12:26.242
to countersue, claiming fraud.

12:26.252 --> 12:26.909
Now it's become a witch-hunt.

12:26.919 --> 12:27.443
I need you to throw me a

12:27.453 --> 12:28.043
lifeline, or these guys

12:29.079 --> 12:29.879
are gonna push me under.

12:29.913 --> 12:30.747
"detective steve billings

12:30.757 --> 12:31.146
"suffers from severe headaches,

12:33.183 --> 12:33.416

12:47.041 --> 12:47.565
It's just a statement

12:48.900 --> 12:49.533
I need you to sign.

12:49.935 --> 12:50.535
I can't sign this.

12:50.669 --> 12:51.402
Look, I lose this job,

12:51.412 --> 12:52.137
i'm just an unemployed guy with

12:53.005 --> 12:53.938
some empty vending machines.

12:54.306 --> 12:54.573
Or maybe

12:54.907 --> 12:55.607
that's what you want.

12:55.617 --> 12:55.973
When does it end with you,

12:57.676 --> 12:57.876
steve?

12:57.886 --> 12:58.510
If you're not gonna do it

13:00.746 --> 13:01.613
for me, do it for my kids.

13:01.613 --> 13:02.113
You heard about

13:03.549 --> 13:04.016
vic and shane?

13:04.918 --> 13:05.584
Yeah. Dutch told me.

13:05.594 --> 13:05.985
Glad I came back

13:07.586 --> 13:07.986
to help out.

13:11.524 --> 13:12.091
Glad to have you.

13:12.101 --> 13:12.625
Danny looks great,

13:13.226 --> 13:13.760
don't you think?

13:13.770 --> 13:14.394
Getting away from this place

13:18.166 --> 13:19.032
does wonders for a person.

13:20.601 --> 13:21.301
Uh, I need something.

13:21.311 --> 13:21.768
I
- I've tried to work it out

13:23.738 --> 13:24.104
with steve.

13:24.672 --> 13:25.239
You've seen that.

13:26.007 --> 13:26.907
But it's time for a change.

13:26.908 --> 13:27.475
Something happen?

13:28.543 --> 13:29.110
It's not working.

13:29.544 --> 13:30.311
We're not, um, meshing.

13:30.321 --> 13:30.911
Well, you're not paid to mesh.

13:32.848 --> 13:33.481
Try to work it out.

13:34.750 --> 13:35.484
All right, never mind.

13:35.851 --> 13:36.618
Forget I said anything.

13:36.628 --> 13:37.285
Dutch, if there's a real

13:40.056 --> 13:40.989
problem, you should tell me.

13:42.858 --> 13:43.258
As a friend?

13:46.862 --> 13:47.029
Sure.

13:48.164 --> 13:48.931
Steve's ex and daughter

13:50.133 --> 13:50.400
came in,

13:50.410 --> 13:50.900
told him they had

13:51.801 --> 13:52.268
a sex offender

13:52.402 --> 13:52.802
who moved in

13:53.537 --> 13:54.037
on their block.

13:54.104 --> 13:54.571
We drove over,

13:54.805 --> 13:55.472
checked the guy out.

13:55.482 --> 13:56.072
He was clean, reported

13:57.208 --> 13:58.008
every time he relocated.

13:58.042 --> 13:58.542
Steve ducks out

13:59.877 --> 14:00.411
for a few hours.

14:00.611 --> 14:01.278
Next thing you know,

14:01.288 --> 14:01.945
the guy's getting hauled away

14:02.780 --> 14:03.680
by north hollywood division

14:03.690 --> 14:04.415
because they found child

14:05.283 --> 14:06.183
pornography in his bedroom.

14:06.250 --> 14:06.683
You're saying

14:07.385 --> 14:07.852
he planted it?

14:07.862 --> 14:08.519
Not him. Somebody from north

14:08.986 --> 14:09.920
hollywood division may have.

14:10.321 --> 14:10.521
I wish

14:11.356 --> 14:12.156
you hadn't told me that.

14:12.166 --> 14:12.724
I can't prove anything.

14:14.158 --> 14:14.758
It's just a hunch.

14:14.760 --> 14:15.294
You participated

14:16.928 --> 14:17.595
in framing a suspect

14:18.696 --> 14:19.563
and engaged in a cover-up.

14:20.198 --> 14:20.298
no.

14:20.308 --> 14:20.966
But you just told me someone

14:22.068 --> 14:22.968
is sitting in a county jail

14:22.978 --> 14:23.702
for something he didn't do.

14:23.712 --> 14:24.403
It's bad enough vendrell

14:24.604 --> 14:25.471
and mackey running around.

14:25.471 --> 14:26.071
Do I have to worry

14:26.239 --> 14:26.872
about you now, too?

14:26.882 --> 14:27.539
I didn't do anything, and I was

14:28.875 --> 14:29.775
talking to you as a friend.

14:29.785 --> 14:30.443
I am a friend, but I also

14:32.346 --> 14:33.146
heard this as a captain,

14:33.156 --> 14:33.679
which now forces me

14:34.481 --> 14:35.014
to do something.

14:35.024 --> 14:35.447
Wait. I did not come in here

14:37.116 --> 14:37.550
to burn cops.

14:37.684 --> 14:38.150
You let me try

14:39.253 --> 14:39.886
and fix this first?

14:39.896 --> 14:40.454
Get this taken care of

14:41.755 --> 14:42.322
before I have to.

14:52.166 --> 14:52.366
Hello?

14:53.534 --> 14:53.934
Rita? Hello?

14:54.369 --> 14:54.869
New girlfriend?

14:56.104 --> 14:56.637
Uh, lloyd's mom.

14:56.647 --> 14:57.204
The boy who shot the kid

14:59.408 --> 15:00.108
in the home invasion.

15:00.118 --> 15:00.641
Three calls from her today,

15:01.977 --> 15:02.477
three hang ups.

15:02.487 --> 15:03.144
Send some unis over there,

15:04.514 --> 15:05.447
make sure everything's okay?

15:05.513 --> 15:05.846
Of course.

15:08.350 --> 15:08.583
Thanks.

15:08.784 --> 15:09.150
Hey, steve,

15:10.320 --> 15:10.886
you got a second?

15:12.355 --> 15:12.822
Call you back.

15:14.491 --> 15:14.824
What's up?

15:14.834 --> 15:15.492
You need to call your friends

15:16.226 --> 15:17.026
over in north hollywood,

15:17.293 --> 15:17.560
get them

15:18.028 --> 15:18.561
to release heap.

15:18.562 --> 15:19.362
And why would I do that?

15:19.372 --> 15:19.963
'cause if you don't, claudette's

15:20.831 --> 15:21.597
gonna move on you guys.

15:21.631 --> 15:22.164
And how did this

15:22.466 --> 15:23.033
get on her radar?

15:23.233 --> 15:23.599
I told her.

15:23.868 --> 15:24.434
Oh, jesus christ.

15:24.444 --> 15:25.135
Look, it came up in conversation

15:26.437 --> 15:27.304
and she shared my opinion.

15:27.314 --> 15:27.938
Oh, so she acted like a cop,

15:29.540 --> 15:30.407
not a friend or a partner.

15:30.417 --> 15:31.008
That sounds familiar.

15:31.018 --> 15:31.575
We need to fix this,

15:31.642 --> 15:32.242
or claudette will.

15:32.252 --> 15:32.876
I don't want that guy

15:33.111 --> 15:33.978
living on my kid's street.

15:34.112 --> 15:34.512
I don't care

15:34.713 --> 15:35.213
where he lives.

15:35.223 --> 15:35.746
Just get him released

15:35.756 --> 15:36.347
from county and get

15:36.714 --> 15:37.381
the charges dropped.

15:37.391 --> 15:37.949
You want to go over

15:37.959 --> 15:38.415
to no-ho and accuse them?

15:39.918 --> 15:40.451
You be my guest.

15:40.461 --> 15:41.186
Heap's innocent. He served

15:42.121 --> 15:43.188
his time. He's been clean since.

15:43.198 --> 15:43.788
Is he really worth burning

15:45.892 --> 15:46.658
cops' reputations over?

15:48.094 --> 15:48.794
I'm not unreasonable.

15:48.804 --> 15:49.361
You need something.

15:53.766 --> 15:54.333
I need something.

15:58.704 --> 15:58.871
Rita?

15:58.881 --> 15:59.338
Uh, no, I'm sorry.

16:01.375 --> 16:01.908
I thought, uh...

16:01.918 --> 16:02.709
Yeah, I can come right over.

16:04.311 --> 16:05.345
I'll be there in a few minutes.

16:06.413 --> 16:06.580
Okay.

16:14.121 --> 16:14.621
Hey. What's up?

16:14.655 --> 16:15.088
Are you gonna

16:15.790 --> 16:16.157
arrest vic?

16:16.167 --> 16:16.791
We're doing everything we can

16:17.926 --> 16:18.660
to stay on top of him.

16:18.670 --> 16:19.126
Well, are you gonna

16:20.661 --> 16:21.028
arrest him?

16:21.930 --> 16:22.563
Not yet.

16:22.764 --> 16:23.197
Vic is smart.

16:23.198 --> 16:23.765
He's been careful

16:24.600 --> 16:25.333
not to expose himself.

16:25.343 --> 16:25.833
That's why he sent ronnie

16:26.669 --> 16:27.135
the last time.

16:27.145 --> 16:27.703
Vic had a legitimate

16:27.713 --> 16:28.270
excuse for not showing

16:29.872 --> 16:30.472
up with the money.

16:30.482 --> 16:31.173
It doesn't do us any good

16:32.142 --> 16:33.142
until we have something solid.

16:33.152 --> 16:33.909
How long are we talking here?

16:35.445 --> 16:36.412
I mean, hours? Weeks? Months?

16:36.679 --> 16:36.946
Corrine,

16:38.515 --> 16:39.182
I know this is hard,

16:39.192 --> 16:39.716
but we're just gonna

16:40.651 --> 16:41.317
have to wait it out.

16:41.327 --> 16:41.717
I risked myself and my family

16:44.321 --> 16:44.721
to help you.

16:44.731 --> 16:45.221
If you wait too long

16:45.723 --> 16:46.189
to arrest him,

16:46.199 --> 16:46.823
he's gonna figure out

16:47.091 --> 16:47.824
what I'm doing to him.

16:47.890 --> 16:48.224
What then?

16:48.234 --> 16:48.691
We're not gonna

16:49.594 --> 16:50.127
let that happen.

16:50.137 --> 16:50.694
If ...  if we thought for a second

16:52.363 --> 16:52.930
vic had a clue ...

16:52.940 --> 16:53.363
What if you figure this out

16:54.332 --> 16:54.632
too late?

16:54.642 --> 16:55.332
No, no, you need to end this.

16:57.435 --> 16:58.269
You need to end this now.

16:58.603 --> 16:59.103
I have an idea.

16:59.504 --> 16:59.670
Shit.

17:00.438 --> 17:01.038
What did mara say?

17:01.048 --> 17:01.773
Well, she said that she and

17:02.708 --> 17:03.741
shane are coming for the money.

17:04.608 --> 17:04.775
When?

17:05.510 --> 17:05.776
Tonight.

17:06.044 --> 17:06.644
She said that, um,

17:06.654 --> 17:07.311
I should bring the money

17:08.381 --> 17:09.314
with a car and clean plates,

17:09.324 --> 17:10.015
and that it should have

17:10.915 --> 17:11.883
a car seat for jackson in it.

17:11.916 --> 17:12.450
She didn't sound

17:13.586 --> 17:14.185
like herself, vic.

17:15.655 --> 17:16.521
I mean, she sounded crazy.

17:16.531 --> 17:16.954
How am I supposed to

17:17.991 --> 17:18.324
get a car?

17:18.358 --> 17:19.125
I'll take care of that.

17:20.527 --> 17:21.560
Where do they want to meet you?

17:21.570 --> 17:22.428
Uh, they don't want to meet.

17:22.438 --> 17:22.962
She said she wants me

17:23.829 --> 17:24.364
to bring the car

17:24.374 --> 17:24.797
to the 10 overpass at alvarado,

17:27.534 --> 17:27.834
7:00 p.m.

17:27.844 --> 17:28.233
Mara said to put the money

17:29.436 --> 17:29.836
in the trunk

17:29.970 --> 17:30.370
and the keys

17:30.771 --> 17:31.304
in the tailpipe.

17:31.839 --> 17:32.039
Vic...

17:34.943 --> 17:35.843
I
- I don't want to go there.

17:35.853 --> 17:36.276
Um, mara really sounded crazy

17:38.579 --> 17:39.012
on the phone.

17:39.180 --> 17:39.747
don't worry.

17:39.757 --> 17:40.347
You won't have to go at all.

17:42.584 --> 17:43.350
I'll handle everything.

17:43.651 --> 17:44.318
After I get the car,

17:44.328 --> 17:44.852
i'll meet with you

17:46.221 --> 17:46.888
to pick up the cash.

17:46.955 --> 17:47.555
We'll meet at 4:00

17:50.226 --> 17:51.159
at st. Anthony's playground.

17:51.169 --> 17:51.960
Then I'll take everything

17:54.030 --> 17:55.064
to the alvarado overpass alone.

17:57.267 --> 17:58.000
Corrine...don't worry.

17:58.010 --> 17:58.501
I won't let anything

18:00.303 --> 18:00.769
happen to you.

18:02.973 --> 18:03.639
I'll go to the drop.

18:03.649 --> 18:04.340
You focus on finding that

18:05.342 --> 18:06.209
port guy we got to jam up.

18:06.219 --> 18:06.776
As desperate as shane is,

18:07.611 --> 18:08.344
this could be a setup.

18:08.354 --> 18:08.878
I'll come with you

18:08.888 --> 18:09.479
and cover your back.

18:09.489 --> 18:10.080
Shane is broke with

18:11.048 --> 18:11.848
an injured pregnant wife

18:11.858 --> 18:12.449
who just killed her last shot

18:13.484 --> 18:14.251
at getting out of this.

18:14.261 --> 18:14.685
He wants to get gone,

18:15.853 --> 18:16.153
trust me.

18:17.155 --> 18:17.988
At least let me tail you.

18:18.990 --> 18:19.790
Maybe I can take a shot.

18:19.800 --> 18:20.658
Forget about getting shane.

18:20.668 --> 18:21.392
We're betting everything

18:22.494 --> 18:23.394
on i.c.e. From here on out.

18:24.429 --> 18:25.295
Something spooked beltran.

18:25.305 --> 18:25.763
He's bringing in

18:27.933 --> 18:28.466
the drugs early.

18:29.133 --> 18:29.466
How early?

18:29.734 --> 18:30.034
Tomorrow.

18:30.044 --> 18:30.568
Me and ronnie are

18:30.578 --> 18:31.169
meeting him at midnight

18:32.304 --> 18:33.071
to go over the details.

18:33.206 --> 18:33.706
How much weight

18:34.073 --> 18:34.773
are we talking about?

18:34.783 --> 18:35.507
Enough so he bought his own

18:36.643 --> 18:37.710
warehouse to store all the shit.

18:37.720 --> 18:38.310
Give me a time and address.

18:40.679 --> 18:41.446
I'll bring the cavalry.

18:42.882 --> 18:43.782
First, we should talk about

18:43.983 --> 18:44.350
wrapping up

18:45.252 --> 18:45.985
me and ronnie's deals.

18:45.995 --> 18:46.419
I'll push on my talks

18:47.620 --> 18:47.920
with d.c.

18:48.088 --> 18:48.855
Well, you better hurry,

18:48.865 --> 18:49.489
because we're gonna need

18:50.224 --> 18:50.957
these deals in writing

18:51.125 --> 18:51.591
before we meet

18:52.092 --> 18:52.792
with beltran tonight.

18:52.802 --> 18:53.192
Just submitting

18:53.761 --> 18:54.161
that request

18:54.171 --> 18:54.594
could take weeks

18:59.867 --> 19:00.200
in itself.

19:00.234 --> 19:00.868
You weren't worried

19:01.803 --> 19:02.703
about bureaucratic bullshit

19:02.703 --> 19:03.303
when you needed me

19:04.706 --> 19:05.473
to get next to pezuela.

19:06.107 --> 19:06.841
I came through for you

19:08.310 --> 19:09.043
every step of the way.

19:09.053 --> 19:09.577
Now, all I'm asking

19:11.647 --> 19:12.313
is that ronnie and I

19:12.323 --> 19:13.147
get the protection we need

19:13.157 --> 19:13.715
before we put our asses

19:14.950 --> 19:15.684
on the shooting range.

19:15.694 --> 19:16.151
Vic, you've got my word.

19:17.286 --> 19:17.653
I will try.

19:18.421 --> 19:18.954
Not good enough.

19:18.964 --> 19:19.555
You'll tell washington

19:20.824 --> 19:21.624
that we need a guarantee

19:21.634 --> 19:22.191
of jobs, salaries,

19:24.394 --> 19:24.994
and full immunity.

19:25.595 --> 19:26.462
Immunity for what exactly?

19:26.472 --> 19:26.995
Look, when I was a cop,

19:30.333 --> 19:30.833
me and my team,

19:30.843 --> 19:31.367
we had to cut some corners

19:33.203 --> 19:33.869
to get the job done.

19:34.070 --> 19:34.437
Our methods

19:35.773 --> 19:36.473
gave me a reputation.

19:36.483 --> 19:36.906
Also got me on my old captain's

19:39.043 --> 19:39.376
shit list,

19:39.386 --> 19:39.943
same reputation you used

19:41.879 --> 19:42.479
to pull in pezuela

19:42.579 --> 19:43.013
and get close

19:43.381 --> 19:43.881
to beltran now.

19:43.891 --> 19:44.448
Putting the cuffs on him

19:45.016 --> 19:45.616
will go a long way

19:45.626 --> 19:46.417
to winning friends in here

19:47.819 --> 19:48.852
and getting wyms off your back.

19:49.387 --> 19:49.921
A bust this big?

19:49.931 --> 19:50.454
It can make people forget

19:51.323 --> 19:51.990
who did what to who.

19:52.391 --> 19:52.724
Meanwhile,

19:53.726 --> 19:54.626
she's still gunning for me.

19:55.527 --> 19:56.394
I need a guarantee ...  now.

19:56.528 --> 19:56.995
You are asking

19:57.930 --> 19:58.564
for the impossible.

19:58.574 --> 19:58.964
Well, then, you can

19:59.298 --> 19:59.698
kiss beltran

19:59.708 --> 20:00.265
and his international

20:02.902 --> 20:03.635
drug pipeline goodbye.

20:03.736 --> 20:04.303
I'm walking away,

20:07.040 --> 20:07.940
knowing I did right by you.

20:08.041 --> 20:08.608
There's something

20:10.010 --> 20:10.943
that you need to understand.

20:10.953 --> 20:11.477
The federal government

20:12.913 --> 20:13.446
is very patient,

20:13.456 --> 20:13.879
and if we don't get beltran

20:15.816 --> 20:16.116
tomorrow,

20:20.654 --> 20:21.488
we'll get him next month.

20:26.394 --> 20:27.094
I.c.e. Just boned me,

20:27.228 --> 20:27.728
and you're next

20:28.830 --> 20:29.563
on the chopping block.

20:29.573 --> 20:30.298
What are you talking about?

20:30.308 --> 20:30.865
Beltran's drug shipment

20:31.433 --> 20:32.000
arrives tomorrow.

20:32.134 --> 20:32.700
I briefed olivia,

20:33.869 --> 20:34.703
told her it had moved up,

20:34.713 --> 20:35.136
that I had everything

20:35.871 --> 20:36.171
in place.

20:36.181 --> 20:36.772
Instead of landing me

20:37.907 --> 20:38.707
that spot on the roster,

20:38.808 --> 20:39.408
she brushed me off

20:41.009 --> 20:41.876
with nothing but an i.o.u.

20:42.144 --> 20:42.477
Welcome to

20:42.779 --> 20:43.579
federal-government hell.

20:43.589 --> 20:44.179
Don't get too comfortable.

20:45.014 --> 20:45.781
I'm only the first cut.

20:45.791 --> 20:46.415
Hey, we agreed to look out

20:47.083 --> 20:47.950
for each other's end game.

20:47.984 --> 20:48.551
It's not my fault

20:49.419 --> 20:50.186
yours played out first.

20:50.921 --> 20:51.654
You're not hearing me.

20:52.122 --> 20:53.022
By working on her timeline,

20:53.032 --> 20:53.489
olivia is hanging us both

20:55.492 --> 20:55.859
out to dry.

20:55.926 --> 20:56.693
Or did you already sign

20:56.927 --> 20:57.394
that paperwork

20:58.262 --> 20:59.096
that you were waiting for

20:59.106 --> 20:59.696
clearing you of this whole

21:01.232 --> 21:01.899
pezuela-beltran mess

21:02.934 --> 21:03.734
before the city primary?

21:04.802 --> 21:05.168
Yeah, well,

21:06.905 --> 21:07.571
it's too late now...

21:07.581 --> 21:08.172
Because I'm pulling out

21:10.108 --> 21:10.908
of this i.c.e. Takedown.

21:11.242 --> 21:11.709
Wait a minute.

21:11.977 --> 21:12.510
If you terminate

21:13.212 --> 21:14.245
your relationship with beltran,

21:14.579 --> 21:14.946
those drugs

21:15.948 --> 21:16.814
are gonna hit the streets.

21:17.248 --> 21:18.048
It's not my job anymore,

21:18.283 --> 21:18.649
as you keep

21:19.585 --> 21:20.218
pointing out to me.

21:20.228 --> 21:20.919
I'm only here to warn you

21:23.656 --> 21:24.656
because we had an arrangement.

21:24.666 --> 21:25.090
Vic, if you walk away

21:25.825 --> 21:26.158
from this,

21:26.225 --> 21:26.659
you will only

21:27.325 --> 21:27.792
burn yourself.

21:28.393 --> 21:28.593
Maybe.

21:28.694 --> 21:29.161
But if beltran

21:29.896 --> 21:30.496
ever does go down,

21:30.506 --> 21:31.096
i.c.e. Is only gonna

21:32.899 --> 21:33.699
look after themselves ...

21:35.803 --> 21:36.536
Not me, not my family,

21:36.603 --> 21:37.036
certainly not

21:40.474 --> 21:40.941
you and yours.

21:41.842 --> 21:42.476
Better hunker down.

21:42.486 --> 21:43.277
Soon you and I are gonna be

21:45.880 --> 21:46.914
looking for a new line of work.

21:52.788 --> 21:53.421
what you

21:54.322 --> 21:55.088
lookin' for, white boy?

21:56.291 --> 21:57.091
depends on what you got.

21:57.225 --> 21:57.659
I got it all.

21:58.493 --> 21:59.093
I'm like wal-mart.

21:59.103 --> 21:59.660
Yeah? You got any, uh,

22:00.429 --> 22:01.029
anything for pain?

22:01.263 --> 22:01.563
Like, uh,

22:03.165 --> 22:03.665
oxy or seconal?

22:03.675 --> 22:04.098
I got shit put your ass

22:05.401 --> 22:05.701
in a coma

22:06.936 --> 22:07.770
and a smile on your face.

22:07.780 --> 22:08.370
Don't move. I'll blow

22:10.474 --> 22:11.274
your goddamn brains out.

22:12.409 --> 22:13.142
Hey, don't play games!

22:14.344 --> 22:14.677
I mean it.

22:15.813 --> 22:16.446
Everything you got.

22:16.456 --> 22:17.013
Empty your pockets right now,

22:22.419 --> 22:23.019
you piece of shit.

22:23.187 --> 22:23.754
People are right.

22:23.754 --> 22:24.354
Wal-mart does have

22:28.960 --> 22:29.760
the best prices in town.

22:29.761 --> 22:30.261
We need to talk

22:31.428 --> 22:31.895
about beltran.

22:31.905 --> 22:32.429
David, I've all but

22:32.964 --> 22:33.464
run out of ways

22:33.531 --> 22:34.031
to convince you

22:34.365 --> 22:34.931
of the importance

22:35.099 --> 22:35.499
of your role

22:36.335 --> 22:37.068
in this investigation.

22:37.202 --> 22:37.802
You mean takedown.

22:37.803 --> 22:38.603
'cause from what I hear,

22:39.004 --> 22:40.037
this could all be over tonight.

22:40.047 --> 22:40.538
The decisions made

22:41.206 --> 22:41.673
by this office

22:41.683 --> 22:42.173
are not mine alone,

22:42.608 --> 22:42.974
councilman.

22:42.984 --> 22:43.608
No, you're just a mouthpiece

22:44.744 --> 22:45.611
for a whole army of suits.

22:45.621 --> 22:46.278
You all got your police training

22:47.947 --> 22:48.847
from the halls of quantico,

22:48.880 --> 22:49.347
but I got mine

22:49.749 --> 22:50.216
in the street.

22:50.226 --> 22:50.916
And then couldn't wait to put

22:52.084 --> 22:52.918
your suit on fast enough.

22:53.185 --> 22:53.485
You know,

22:53.553 --> 22:54.253
in a sting operation,

22:54.263 --> 22:54.753
you listen to the man

22:56.323 --> 22:56.789
on the inside.

22:56.799 --> 22:57.423
Vic's the only lifeline you got

22:58.057 --> 22:58.924
to what's really going on.

22:59.058 --> 22:59.492
If you choose

23:00.494 --> 23:01.094
to ignore him now,

23:01.104 --> 23:01.795
your little cartel problem's

23:03.298 --> 23:04.298
only gonna get worse later on.

23:05.632 --> 23:06.432
I appreciate the advice.

23:06.734 --> 23:07.201
Vic's out now.

23:07.211 --> 23:07.634
We are still going to stop

23:10.171 --> 23:10.604
the cartel ...

23:12.173 --> 23:12.839
With or without vic.

23:12.849 --> 23:13.507
Then I'll just have to

23:15.910 --> 23:16.844
read about it in the papers,

23:16.854 --> 23:17.244
because if vic's out,

23:19.814 --> 23:20.081
so am i.

23:20.091 --> 23:20.648
I'm gonna handle this

23:21.650 --> 23:22.250
on the city level,

23:30.560 --> 23:31.426
where I have more control.

23:36.132 --> 23:36.299
Yeah?

23:36.433 --> 23:37.200
We want you to come in.

23:37.210 --> 23:37.734
Chaffee sold washington

23:39.236 --> 23:39.769
on your package.

23:41.537 --> 23:42.004
Job, immunity.

23:45.175 --> 23:45.641
Are you there?

23:47.110 --> 23:47.276
Yeah.

23:47.411 --> 23:47.911
Yeah, I'm here.

23:48.012 --> 23:48.579
Your beltran meet

23:51.549 --> 23:52.315
still set for midnight?

23:52.325 --> 23:52.782
He's just waiting

23:54.586 --> 23:54.952
on my word.

23:54.986 --> 23:55.619
Then get down here.

23:55.620 --> 23:56.387
Federal paperwork tends

23:57.322 --> 23:58.322
to be heavy on the fine print.

23:59.323 --> 23:59.690
Yeah, okay.

24:06.132 --> 24:07.032
Good news. I got an address

24:09.168 --> 24:10.235
on our port worker in san pedro.

24:10.369 --> 24:10.969
His name's nuÃ‘ez.

24:12.038 --> 24:13.105
I can head over there right now.

24:14.274 --> 24:14.740
Olivia called.

24:15.742 --> 24:16.475
She came through, man.

24:16.476 --> 24:17.109
Our immunity papers

24:18.812 --> 24:19.545
are just sitting there

24:19.580 --> 24:20.280
waiting to be signed.

24:20.290 --> 24:20.913
Feds are gonna pull us

24:21.981 --> 24:22.715
out of this quicksand,

24:22.882 --> 24:23.282
gonna pay us

24:25.619 --> 24:26.186
for our troubles.

24:26.196 --> 24:26.920
We can still take care of

24:27.522 --> 24:28.422
that shane thing right now.

24:28.422 --> 24:29.022
Well, once we sign

24:30.291 --> 24:30.924
that immunity deal,

24:31.025 --> 24:31.525
it won't matter

24:43.872 --> 24:44.672
what shane does ...  ever.

24:44.682 --> 24:45.373
I really appreciate this.

24:45.440 --> 24:45.974
You're gonna get

24:48.010 --> 24:48.643
your money's worth.

24:49.912 --> 24:50.412
I guarantee it.

24:54.216 --> 24:54.949
What is he doing here?

24:55.284 --> 24:55.550
You said

24:56.553 --> 24:57.186
our deal was ready.

24:57.196 --> 24:57.552
I said we had your deal ready ...

25:01.958 --> 25:02.258
Singular.

25:03.693 --> 25:04.393
Vic, um ... job offer.

25:04.461 --> 25:04.894
Your immunity

25:05.996 --> 25:06.563
is taken care of,

25:06.573 --> 25:07.297
but I couldn't get them

25:09.099 --> 25:10.166
to sign off on ronnie this fast.

25:12.670 --> 25:13.003
I'm sorry.

25:15.206 --> 25:15.940
There's no sorry here.

25:16.307 --> 25:16.574
The deal

25:18.209 --> 25:18.943
was for me and my guy.

25:20.012 --> 25:20.845
It's just you ...  for now.

25:23.114 --> 25:23.480
Tell me how

25:25.417 --> 25:25.984
I get this fixed.

25:26.185 --> 25:26.751
Not gonna happen.

25:26.761 --> 25:27.519
Your deal is on the table.

25:29.122 --> 25:30.122
That's all we can offer today.

25:30.132 --> 25:30.722
We can discuss detective

25:31.791 --> 25:32.591
gardocki at a later date

25:32.601 --> 25:33.359
after beltran's arrested

25:35.028 --> 25:36.028
and we have the drug shipment.

25:37.030 --> 25:37.596
This is bullshit.

25:37.606 --> 25:38.164
washington

25:38.665 --> 25:39.265
wasn't comfortable

25:39.275 --> 25:39.698
extending a deal beyond vic

25:40.467 --> 25:40.900
this quickly.

25:40.910 --> 25:41.434
We'd floated his job

25:42.369 --> 25:42.902
earlier to them.

25:43.036 --> 25:43.703
They don't know you.

25:43.713 --> 25:44.337
You've only just become a player

25:45.972 --> 25:46.706
in this investigation.

25:46.716 --> 25:47.206
Nothing I've done

25:47.407 --> 25:47.874
for you people

25:47.884 --> 25:48.408
could have been possible

25:50.877 --> 25:51.377
without ronnie.

25:51.387 --> 25:51.911
If ronnie shows us

25:52.980 --> 25:53.480
some good faith

25:53.490 --> 25:53.913
in this beltran takedown

25:55.115 --> 25:55.415
tomorrow,

25:55.425 --> 25:55.982
he'll be signing the same deal

26:00.254 --> 26:00.821
in a week's time.

26:01.623 --> 26:02.056
Vic, sign it.

26:02.066 --> 26:02.857
And let's grab these drugs

26:12.234 --> 26:13.267
before they get in circulation.

26:15.003 --> 26:15.703
I'm not signing shit.

26:15.737 --> 26:16.204
This was never

26:16.939 --> 26:17.406
about just me.

26:17.416 --> 26:17.872
This was about me and ronnie,

26:19.675 --> 26:20.042
both of us.

26:20.052 --> 26:20.609
You are making a mistake.

26:20.710 --> 26:21.177
You're the one

26:21.478 --> 26:22.044
making a mistake.

26:22.054 --> 26:22.511
I'm not handing you

26:23.746 --> 26:24.113
half a win,

26:24.123 --> 26:24.513
so I don't want

26:26.449 --> 26:26.849
half a deal.

26:26.859 --> 26:27.350
When you can offer

26:28.619 --> 26:29.085
the same thing

26:29.095 --> 26:29.652
at the same time to ronnie,

26:31.488 --> 26:32.055
then you call me.

26:32.065 --> 26:32.589
If that's before midnight

26:33.757 --> 26:34.257
tonight, great.

26:34.267 --> 26:34.858
If not, I know how patient

26:37.161 --> 26:37.828
you feds like to be.

26:47.510 --> 26:48.210
Never trust a blonde.

26:49.011 --> 26:49.711
Vic, I appreciate it.

26:50.046 --> 26:50.412
Don't, man.

26:52.248 --> 26:53.248
There wasn't any other choice.

26:57.086 --> 26:57.686
What do we do now?

26:57.696 --> 26:58.153
I got to get that car

26:58.855 --> 26:59.222
to corrine,

26:59.232 --> 26:59.655
and you got to get to nuÃ‘ez

27:01.158 --> 27:01.591
in san pedro.

27:01.601 --> 27:02.024
Make sure he calls in sick

27:04.594 --> 27:04.894
tomorrow.

27:06.831 --> 27:07.497
This ain't over yet.

27:13.037 --> 27:13.370
I told you

27:14.272 --> 27:14.972
to stay away from us.

27:15.673 --> 27:16.140
Is lloyd home?

27:16.150 --> 27:16.774
You know, it's been hard enough

27:17.542 --> 27:18.376
for me trying to help him

27:18.386 --> 27:19.110
get over your accusations

27:19.878 --> 27:20.945
without having to see your face.

27:20.955 --> 27:21.512
I'm sorry things happened

27:22.848 --> 27:23.414
the way they did.

27:23.516 --> 27:24.316
I was worried about you.

27:24.326 --> 27:24.883
Don't you dare pretend

27:26.385 --> 27:26.952
even for a second

27:26.962 --> 27:27.385
that you gave a damn

27:28.587 --> 27:28.887
about me.

27:28.897 --> 27:29.287
This is all about your obsession

27:30.388 --> 27:30.788
with my son.

27:30.789 --> 27:31.256
You're scared,

27:31.824 --> 27:32.191
aren't you?

27:32.201 --> 27:32.725
Had to be to call

27:33.893 --> 27:34.426
that many times.

27:35.127 --> 27:35.560
Is he inside?

27:36.963 --> 27:37.563
I didn't call you!

27:39.299 --> 27:39.632
You did...

27:41.067 --> 27:41.234
Uh...

27:46.106 --> 27:46.539
...six times.

27:46.773 --> 27:47.106
I want you

27:48.042 --> 27:48.742
to leave my property.

27:48.752 --> 27:49.342
You knock on my door again,

27:54.348 --> 27:55.148
i'm lodging a complaint.

27:59.154 --> 27:59.387
Julien.

28:00.789 --> 28:01.322
Red thunderbird.

28:01.332 --> 28:02.023
Excuse me. Those, uh, those egg

28:04.060 --> 28:05.060
sandwiches ... are they up yet?

28:06.161 --> 28:06.961
It'll be another minute.

28:07.629 --> 28:08.029
Right. Okay.

28:08.330 --> 28:08.663
California

28:15.538 --> 28:16.371
2-
frank-adam-nancy-3-2-1.

28:26.883 --> 28:27.016
god.

28:27.026 --> 28:27.617
License number's registered

28:30.053 --> 28:30.820
to a larry kristiansen,

28:30.821 --> 28:31.387
but it belongs on

28:32.623 --> 28:33.223
a 2005 gold acura.

28:33.233 --> 28:33.757
I'll check these stores.

28:45.704 --> 28:46.337
You go around back.

28:55.648 --> 28:56.114
Givee the gun.

28:56.949 --> 28:57.583
Hey, hey! Hey! Hey.

28:57.593 --> 28:58.150
Shut up. Don't make a sound.

28:59.385 --> 29:00.085
Tina, where's julien?

29:00.095 --> 29:00.585
Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey!

29:02.622 --> 29:03.089
Stop it, okay?

29:03.099 --> 29:03.555
I don't want to shoot you,

29:05.625 --> 29:05.992
but I will.

29:11.431 --> 29:12.198
I will shoot you, okay?

29:15.002 --> 29:15.502
Where's julien?

29:15.870 --> 29:16.304
Where is he?!

29:16.314 --> 29:16.837
He's inside looking through

29:17.839 --> 29:18.339
all the stores.

29:18.340 --> 29:18.940
What do they know?

29:20.308 --> 29:21.108
How much time do I have?

29:21.242 --> 29:22.109
Three minutes till backup,

29:22.243 --> 29:22.743
and I called in

29:25.781 --> 29:26.648
your stolen license plate.

29:26.658 --> 29:27.281
Look, they know what mara did ...

29:29.285 --> 29:30.118
That she shot that woman.

29:30.128 --> 29:30.485
And that woman's dead,

29:32.154 --> 29:32.354
shane.

29:33.189 --> 29:34.156
None of this is mara's fault.

29:35.124 --> 29:35.824
I believe that. I do.

29:35.834 --> 29:36.558
Why don't you just give me

29:37.494 --> 29:38.561
the gun and come in with me now?

29:38.695 --> 29:39.262
We can have a car

29:42.432 --> 29:43.299
pick up mara and your son,

29:46.570 --> 29:47.270
and they can be safe.

29:47.604 --> 29:48.437
Please, shane. Stop this.

29:48.805 --> 29:49.105
Hey, hey.

29:49.115 --> 29:49.672
My wife

29:55.079 --> 29:55.779
is not going to jail.

29:55.789 --> 29:56.146
I've always liked you,

29:57.715 --> 29:57.915
shane,

29:57.925 --> 29:58.315
but an innocent woman

30:00.484 --> 30:00.751
is dead.

30:00.761 --> 30:01.151
And this has gone

30:02.020 --> 30:02.420
way too far.

30:02.587 --> 30:03.254
You don't want this.

30:03.264 --> 30:03.788
I'm afraid that something bad

30:05.624 --> 30:06.257
will happen to you,

30:06.725 --> 30:07.492
or even worse, to mara.

30:07.793 --> 30:08.493
Think about your son.

30:08.827 --> 30:09.194
So, please,

30:14.900 --> 30:15.733
just come in with me now.

30:18.170 --> 30:18.770
No, it's too late.

30:20.039 --> 30:20.406
No, it's ...

30:22.141 --> 30:22.741
No, it's too late.

30:33.153 --> 30:33.887
Where the hell is vic?

30:34.121 --> 30:34.454
He's late,

30:51.706 --> 30:52.306
but he'll be here.

30:54.509 --> 30:54.976
oh, shit.

31:01.617 --> 31:02.251
Vic, where are you?

31:02.261 --> 31:02.650
The cops are there,

31:03.719 --> 31:03.986
corrine.

31:05.556 --> 31:06.256
They're watching you.

31:06.857 --> 31:07.690
The cops are watching me?

31:07.700 --> 31:08.191
How do you know?

31:10.026 --> 31:10.493
Where are you?

31:10.627 --> 31:11.161
How did he know?

31:11.171 --> 31:11.761
I was careful. I was

31:11.862 --> 31:12.662
sure nobody followed me.

31:12.672 --> 31:13.329
Did you hear anything strange

31:14.732 --> 31:15.665
on the phone call with mara?

31:15.675 --> 31:16.266
You think that, uh, they have

31:17.935 --> 31:18.702
a wire tap on my phone?

31:18.712 --> 31:19.168
Did you talk to anybody else

31:20.170 --> 31:20.537
about this?

31:21.172 --> 31:21.272
no.

31:21.282 --> 31:21.839
No, I wouldn't do that.

31:22.974 --> 31:23.507
I know better.

31:23.517 --> 31:24.040
If we don't have vic on tape,

31:24.976 --> 31:25.476
we got nothing.

31:25.743 --> 31:26.043
Vic, vic,

31:27.478 --> 31:28.045
what do I do now?

31:28.680 --> 31:29.380
Get up and walk away.

31:29.748 --> 31:29.981
Move in

31:30.182 --> 31:30.815
and arrest corrine.

31:30.849 --> 31:31.249
Move in now.

31:32.083 --> 31:32.516
Now, move in!

31:34.920 --> 31:35.086
Shit.

31:35.187 --> 31:35.720
am I in

31:36.422 --> 31:37.122
some sort of trouble?

31:37.132 --> 31:37.489
I mean, what's gonna happen

31:38.390 --> 31:38.590
to me?

31:38.591 --> 31:39.124
How do I explain

31:40.092 --> 31:40.592
all this money?

31:40.602 --> 31:41.092
Leave it. Leave the bag there

31:42.528 --> 31:42.995
and walk away.

31:43.005 --> 31:43.595
Go to your car as fast

31:44.898 --> 31:45.664
as you can and go home.

31:45.932 --> 31:46.532
The cops are here.

31:46.542 --> 31:47.266
They're coming after me.

31:48.335 --> 31:49.235
What do I do? Jesus christ.

31:49.245 --> 31:49.835
corrine mackey,

31:51.237 --> 31:51.904
you're under arrest.

31:52.038 --> 31:52.338
Vic? Vic?

31:54.674 --> 31:55.108
Hello? Hello?

31:55.775 --> 31:56.375
Okay, we got to go

31:56.385 --> 31:56.909
through the motions.

32:09.224 --> 32:09.890
Vic may be watching.

32:26.852 --> 32:26.985
hey.

32:29.622 --> 32:30.455
I'm sorry I took so long.

32:31.590 --> 32:31.923
How is it?

32:33.559 --> 32:33.926
It's awful!

32:34.761 --> 32:35.327
I couldn't get us

32:36.162 --> 32:36.662
anything to eat

32:36.672 --> 32:37.196
because the, uh, the cops ...

32:39.065 --> 32:39.598
They spotted me.

32:39.666 --> 32:40.266
Cops ... holy shit.

32:40.767 --> 32:40.934
Yeah,

32:42.135 --> 32:42.901
I had to ditch the car.

32:44.438 --> 32:44.871
Are you okay?

32:44.938 --> 32:45.505
Yeah, I-i'm fine.

32:46.674 --> 32:47.374
Don't worry about me.

32:49.276 --> 32:49.776
You just, uh...

32:51.779 --> 32:52.613
I want you to take these.

32:52.680 --> 32:53.147
What are they?

32:53.381 --> 32:53.714
They're ...

32:55.083 --> 32:55.650
They're seconals,

32:55.660 --> 32:56.150
and they will help

32:59.954 --> 33:00.421
with the pain.

33:00.620 --> 33:00.720
mm.

33:02.022 --> 33:02.189
Okay.

33:03.524 --> 33:03.624
oh.

33:05.761 --> 33:06.061
Oh, my...

33:08.831 --> 33:09.565
What else did you get?

33:09.575 --> 33:10.132
Um, just some, uh,

33:12.101 --> 33:12.668
some street shit.

33:13.069 --> 33:13.369
You know,

33:14.437 --> 33:15.304
some meth and weed, but ...

33:15.472 --> 33:16.072
And a little blow,

33:17.506 --> 33:18.473
but I-I had to do most of it.

33:19.075 --> 33:19.275
Shane.

33:19.285 --> 33:19.809
The stuff that they made me

33:20.810 --> 33:21.344
do last night ...

33:23.080 --> 33:23.613
I was cratering,

33:24.281 --> 33:25.148
and I need to stay focused

33:25.315 --> 33:25.749
so that I can

33:27.217 --> 33:27.850
get us out of this.

33:27.851 --> 33:28.417
You can't help us

33:29.954 --> 33:30.654
if you're high, baby.

33:30.688 --> 33:31.288
It was just enough

33:33.724 --> 33:34.424
to even me out, okay?

33:41.232 --> 33:41.565
I promise.

33:41.566 --> 33:42.132
any movement

33:44.202 --> 33:44.769
on ronnie's deal?

33:44.779 --> 33:45.369
Not in the timetable

33:49.107 --> 33:49.740
you're looking for.

33:49.841 --> 33:50.341
I want my deal,

33:52.778 --> 33:53.411
but I need a favor.

33:54.547 --> 33:55.213
It's not for ronnie.

33:56.548 --> 33:57.215
It's for my ex-wife.

33:57.482 --> 33:57.782
I got her

34:00.953 --> 34:01.553
into some trouble.

34:01.620 --> 34:02.087
She was trying

34:05.526 --> 34:06.192
to protect me today,

34:06.227 --> 34:06.927
and she did something

34:06.937 --> 34:07.594
that might be construed

34:08.728 --> 34:09.495
as aiding and abetting.

34:10.063 --> 34:10.697
Might be construed?

34:10.764 --> 34:11.398
She's a good woman.

34:13.000 --> 34:13.867
She raises our three kids.

34:13.934 --> 34:14.301
Two of them

34:14.868 --> 34:15.301
are autistic.

34:15.311 --> 34:15.802
I can't let anything

34:20.474 --> 34:20.940
happen to her.

34:21.443 --> 34:22.342
Look, you give me that deal

34:23.277 --> 34:24.178
in time to make the meeting

34:24.188 --> 34:24.911
and you give her a pass

34:25.681 --> 34:26.714
on this one aiding and abetting

34:26.724 --> 34:27.415
and I'll give you beltran

34:29.217 --> 34:30.184
and the whole goddamn cartel.

34:30.194 --> 34:30.618
Black board of directors

34:31.786 --> 34:32.219
on top of it.

34:32.230 --> 34:32.754
I can't do anything

34:37.592 --> 34:38.092
for ronnie yet.

34:38.159 --> 34:38.659
Ronnie can wait

34:40.963 --> 34:41.563
until next week...

34:43.699 --> 34:44.199
After the bust.

34:48.947 --> 34:49.606
your favorite

34:50.907 --> 34:51.806
child rapist is a free man.

34:51.817 --> 34:52.275
Hope your morals

34:52.743 --> 34:53.110
stay intact

34:53.120 --> 34:53.777
when some middle-school girl's

34:57.749 --> 34:58.649
asshole gets stretched out.

34:58.659 --> 34:59.383
"detective steve billings may

35:00.351 --> 35:01.284
have sustained a head injury

35:01.319 --> 35:01.885
"possibly leading

35:03.355 --> 35:04.121
to the lack of judgment

35:05.724 --> 35:06.590
and general irritability"?

35:06.992 --> 35:07.558
This is bullshit.

35:07.560 --> 35:08.293
My statement, accurate

35:08.860 --> 35:09.760
as I felt comfortable with.

35:09.961 --> 35:10.361
Well, thanks

35:10.696 --> 35:11.329
for dressing it up.

35:11.339 --> 35:11.829
You're a real stand-up guy,

35:14.766 --> 35:15.232
you know that?

35:15.501 --> 35:15.701
Danny?

35:16.368 --> 35:16.768
yeah?

35:16.778 --> 35:17.503
My kids are at the sitter's.

35:18.604 --> 35:19.637
They need to be picked up soon.

35:19.805 --> 35:20.272
Do you need me

35:21.708 --> 35:22.541
to call somebody for you?

35:23.610 --> 35:24.377
There's nobody to call.

35:24.578 --> 35:25.478
My sitter, she's a student,

35:25.488 --> 35:25.912
and I can't leave them there

35:28.414 --> 35:28.714
too late.

35:29.115 --> 35:29.415
Okay, uh,

35:31.352 --> 35:32.319
I get off in a few minutes.

35:32.329 --> 35:32.786
I guess I could bring them

35:33.520 --> 35:33.887
to my house

35:33.954 --> 35:34.588
and keep them there

35:35.790 --> 35:36.657
until you get out of here.

35:36.667 --> 35:37.523
That's really nice of you.

35:38.759 --> 35:39.559
sure, I'm happy to help.

35:45.333 --> 35:45.800
How you doing?

35:45.810 --> 35:46.366
How much longer do I have to

35:47.402 --> 35:47.969
stay in here for?

35:48.169 --> 35:48.503
Vic thinks

35:49.171 --> 35:49.704
you're arrested.

35:49.714 --> 35:50.505
If he hears anything, asks

35:52.808 --> 35:53.842
around, it's got to seem legit.

35:54.309 --> 35:54.476
Look,

35:54.477 --> 35:55.177
as bad as vic can be,

35:55.187 --> 35:55.744
he's not gonna let you

35:56.779 --> 35:57.345
rot away in here.

36:00.116 --> 36:00.516
dutch!

36:09.159 --> 36:10.092
We've got a location on vic.

36:11.427 --> 36:11.894
Any questions?

36:11.904 --> 36:12.394
I need to make sure

36:12.829 --> 36:13.295

36:13.429 --> 36:13.829
each section

36:13.930 --> 36:14.597

36:14.932 --> 36:15.298
Section "a"

36:16.300 --> 36:17.267
is your employment agreement.

36:17.277 --> 36:17.800
It's a three-year contract

36:18.969 --> 36:19.469
with the agency

36:19.636 --> 36:20.003
that begins

36:20.571 --> 36:21.237
as soon as you sign.

36:21.238 --> 36:21.805
Your compensation

36:23.006 --> 36:23.606

36:30.014 --> 36:30.581

36:30.882 --> 36:31.249
Section "b"

36:33.919 --> 36:34.819
is your immunity agreement.

36:34.829 --> 36:35.519
It states that in exchange

36:35.520 --> 36:36.120
for your continued

36:36.922 --> 36:37.689

36:37.699 --> 36:38.122
with the beltran

36:38.557 --> 36:38.990

36:39.000 --> 36:39.524

36:40.735 --> 36:41.159

36:41.961 --> 36:42.394

for any and all truthful

36:44.463 --> 36:45.397

36:45.697 --> 36:45.964
Anything

36:46.466 --> 36:47.166
you fail to disclose,

36:47.176 --> 36:47.599
or if your statements

36:48.568 --> 36:48.901
are false,

36:48.911 --> 36:49.535
or if you ever fail to provide

36:51.337 --> 36:52.204
your agreed-upon services,

36:52.238 --> 36:52.738
the entire deal

36:53.407 --> 36:53.907
will be voided.

36:54.041 --> 36:54.641
What about corrine

36:56.310 --> 36:57.210
on the aiding and abetting?

36:57.220 --> 36:57.743
Her immunity is covered

37:09.290 --> 37:09.790

37:34.016 --> 37:34.483
Your statement

37:35.018 --> 37:35.585

37:38.789 --> 37:39.222
but let's try

37:44.962 --> 37:45.895
to get through this quickly.

37:45.905 --> 37:46.429
Is there anything

37:47.097 --> 37:47.597
you want to say

37:47.607 --> 37:48.031
before I turn on

37:52.770 --> 37:53.203
the recorder?

37:56.542 --> 37:57.242
State your full name.

37:58.209 --> 37:58.909

38:03.648 --> 38:04.048

38:10.189 --> 38:10.889

38:15.361 --> 38:15.494
yes.

38:24.572 --> 38:25.272
Anytime you're ready.

38:58.542 --> 38:59.542
During a raid on a drug dealer

39:06.283 --> 39:06.850
named two-time...

39:10.254 --> 39:10.487
...i...

39:10.488 --> 39:11.088
...shot and killed

39:15.393 --> 39:16.193
detective terry crowley.

39:16.203 --> 39:16.760
you ... you killed

39:18.964 --> 39:19.530
a police officer?

39:19.731 --> 39:20.165
I planned it,

39:24.069 --> 39:24.769
and I carried it out.

39:24.870 --> 39:25.370
I shot him once

39:33.246 --> 39:33.880
just below the eye.

39:34.047 --> 39:34.547
Our strike team

39:37.017 --> 39:37.950
was committing criminal acts

39:38.185 --> 39:38.818
on a regular basis.

39:38.828 --> 39:39.419
At first it was just

39:42.857 --> 39:43.657
taking drugs from busts,

39:43.757 --> 39:44.357
turning it around,

39:45.126 --> 39:45.993
and selling it for profit.

39:46.003 --> 39:46.626
We were able to do this

39:47.462 --> 39:48.195
by making partnerships

39:48.205 --> 39:48.628
with local drug dealers

39:51.232 --> 39:51.565
and gangs,

39:51.575 --> 39:52.132
you know, that we knew

39:54.268 --> 39:54.868
we could leverage.

39:55.603 --> 39:56.237
You son of a bitch.

39:56.404 --> 39:56.938
I killed crowley

40:00.142 --> 40:01.009
to protect me and my guys.

40:01.019 --> 40:01.609
I shot him with two-time's gun

40:05.281 --> 40:05.947
to divert suspicion,

40:10.787 --> 40:11.353
but aceveda knew.

40:12.322 --> 40:12.955
So did kavanaugh ...

40:12.965 --> 40:13.522
The i.a.d. Investigator

40:16.560 --> 40:17.126
who was after us.

40:18.862 --> 40:19.795
They just couldn't prove it.

40:25.068 --> 40:25.568
I was too good.

40:32.877 --> 40:33.244
Is that it?

40:33.344 --> 40:33.844
How much memory

40:35.413 --> 40:36.046
has that thing got?

40:41.636 --> 40:44.529
My team and I left some marked
money for a guy named o'brien.

40:44.539 --> 40:45.163
The money had been stolen

40:47.433 --> 40:48.166
from the armenian mob.

40:49.801 --> 40:50.168
$2 million.

40:51.970 --> 40:52.570
We found out later

40:54.473 --> 40:54.906
it was, uh ...

40:54.941 --> 40:55.507
The cash was part

40:56.442 --> 40:57.076
of an investigation

40:57.086 --> 40:57.643
into the local armenian

41:01.348 --> 41:01.915
money laundering.

41:01.925 --> 41:02.716
It was only a matter of time

41:02.726 --> 41:03.450
before they connected o'brien

41:08.356 --> 41:09.423
to the cash and they killed him.

41:09.433 --> 41:09.823
Why did you plant the money

41:13.160 --> 41:13.394
on him?

41:13.404 --> 41:13.960
Couldn't let the armenians know

41:15.196 --> 41:15.929
that we'd stolen it...

41:17.532 --> 41:17.899
...could i?

41:17.909 --> 41:18.633
I'm captain claudette wyms.

41:20.702 --> 41:21.602
I'm looking for vic mackey.

41:22.403 --> 41:23.137
You found the bastard,

41:23.337 --> 41:23.704
but I guess

41:26.008 --> 41:26.708
now he's our bastard.

41:26.718 --> 41:27.308
the armenians didn't like

41:28.544 --> 41:29.177
getting ripped off,

41:29.187 --> 41:29.744
so they sent an old-school goon

41:32.181 --> 41:32.881
to find it ...  margos.

41:32.891 --> 41:33.582
He hacked off half the feet

41:35.952 --> 41:36.918
in farmington looking for it.

41:36.953 --> 41:37.519
Eventually things

41:38.555 --> 41:39.322
started pointing at us.

41:39.332 --> 41:39.721
It was the beginning of the end

41:40.990 --> 41:41.390
for my team.

41:41.400 --> 41:42.091
Shane vendrell's wife, mara,

41:45.062 --> 41:46.062
took some of the marked money.

41:46.072 --> 41:46.495
She gave it away.

41:49.132 --> 41:49.666
Lem's conscience

41:50.634 --> 41:51.400
started getting to him.

41:51.601 --> 41:52.001
It turned us

41:53.104 --> 41:53.737
against each other.

41:54.806 --> 41:55.606
What happened to margos?

41:59.844 --> 42:00.278
I killed him.

42:00.812 --> 42:01.545
I got the drop on him.

42:01.813 --> 42:02.146
I shot him

42:02.982 --> 42:03.782
when he dropped his gun,

42:03.792 --> 42:04.482
massaged the crime scene

42:05.317 --> 42:06.184
to make it look righteous.

42:06.194 --> 42:06.818
What kind of detective did you

42:08.387 --> 42:09.254
raise over there, captain?

42:09.255 --> 42:09.822
What kind of deal

42:12.390 --> 42:12.957
did you give him?

42:14.827 --> 42:15.294
Full immunity.

42:15.660 --> 42:15.960
On what?!

42:16.061 --> 42:16.494
On everything

42:17.930 --> 42:18.464
he confesses to.

42:18.464 --> 42:18.998
Shane killed lem

42:24.271 --> 42:24.771
with a grenade.

42:24.781 --> 42:25.204
I didn't find out

42:25.939 --> 42:26.272
about that

42:26.282 --> 42:27.007
until after I'd already tortured

42:29.410 --> 42:30.343
and killed our lead suspect,

42:30.678 --> 42:31.078
guardo lima.

42:31.088 --> 42:31.678
I eventually got emolia

42:33.581 --> 42:34.248
to recant her story,

42:38.520 --> 42:39.220
but it didn't matter.

42:42.491 --> 42:43.124
Lem was still gone.

42:43.134 --> 42:43.658
And our armenian problem

42:45.293 --> 42:45.927
was just beginning.

42:45.937 --> 42:46.427
The meeting with beltran

42:48.096 --> 42:48.562
is in an hour.

42:48.564 --> 42:49.231
I think we should ...

42:49.265 --> 42:49.931
Oh, we better hurry,

42:50.266 --> 42:51.099
because I got a lot more,

42:51.109 --> 42:51.867
and I'm not letting you wiggle

42:53.303 --> 42:54.303
out of this on a technicality,

42:54.313 --> 42:54.970
so you sit there and let me

42:57.040 --> 42:57.973
finish what I've got to say.

42:57.983 --> 42:58.607
Now, after I'd found out

43:02.445 --> 43:03.178
what shane had done...

43:04.981 --> 43:05.315
Claudette?

43:06.249 --> 43:06.949
After all they did ...

43:07.384 --> 43:07.684
I
- I know.

43:07.694 --> 43:08.084
And they just walk away

43:08.551 --> 43:08.818
with it!

43:08.828 --> 43:09.485
Look, he gave up ronnie,

43:10.688 --> 43:11.621
and we're gonna catch shane.

43:13.090 --> 43:13.357
But vic!

43:13.367 --> 43:13.790
Uh...you did the best

43:14.124 --> 43:14.457
you could.

43:14.467 --> 43:15.058
Yeah, which is more

43:15.226 --> 43:15.992
than I can say for you.

43:16.002 --> 43:16.559
You put a lot of careers

43:17.194 --> 43:17.761
in jeopardy today

43:17.862 --> 43:18.362
with that stunt

43:19.730 --> 43:20.530
you and billings pulled.

43:21.165 --> 43:21.365
What?!

43:21.933 --> 43:22.700
Oh, don't act innocent.

43:22.801 --> 43:23.468
You broke the rules,

43:23.478 --> 43:23.934
and it's gonna blow up

43:24.869 --> 43:25.235
in my face.

43:25.245 --> 43:25.803
I know you're upset

43:27.639 --> 43:28.206
about vic, but ...

43:28.216 --> 43:28.974
Don't tell me how I feel.

43:28.984 --> 43:29.407
Take some responsibility

43:30.542 --> 43:30.842
for once!

43:30.852 --> 43:31.376
If this is really

43:31.843 --> 43:32.343
about billings,

43:32.611 --> 43:32.911
i'll pull

43:33.011 --> 43:33.611
back my statement.

43:33.621 --> 43:34.179
Oh, you think by doing

43:35.247 --> 43:35.981
just one little thing,

43:35.991 --> 43:36.581
it's gonna make up for all

43:38.384 --> 43:39.184
your past indiscretions?

43:39.352 --> 43:40.152
We need to get you home.

43:40.162 --> 43:40.552
Oh, get your goddamn hands

43:43.056 --> 43:43.289
off me!

43:43.299 --> 43:43.823
You're fired, you sanctimonious

43:45.724 --> 43:46.224
son of a bitch!

43:46.426 --> 43:46.659
Fired?!

43:47.694 --> 43:48.027
You heard.

43:48.037 --> 43:48.661
Now go on back to the barn,

43:48.695 --> 43:49.295
pick up your shit,

43:50.196 --> 43:50.896
and get the hell out.

43:51.564 --> 43:51.897
Claudette!

43:53.333 --> 43:53.666
Claudette!

44:06.948 --> 44:07.448
This isn't you.

44:21.130 --> 44:21.830
Pills aren't working?

44:24.200 --> 44:24.300
no.

44:24.310 --> 44:24.700
It's like a knife

44:26.736 --> 44:27.136
in my chest.

44:27.146 --> 44:27.602
Maybe you should take

44:29.039 --> 44:29.405
a few more.

44:30.974 --> 44:31.507
I don't want to.

44:33.876 --> 44:34.243
The baby...

44:40.751 --> 44:41.484
How'd this all happen?

44:46.590 --> 44:47.124
I'm sorry, baby.

44:50.795 --> 44:51.228
I'm so sorry.

44:57.804 --> 44:58.470
I killed that woman.

45:01.140 --> 45:01.807
I killed her, shane.

45:03.876 --> 45:04.676
I can't do this anymore.

45:05.544 --> 45:05.878
No, don't.

45:06.045 --> 45:06.378
No, don't.

45:09.015 --> 45:09.482
Don't give up.

45:13.018 --> 45:13.318
We can't.

45:14.955 --> 45:15.388
I'm a murder.

45:16.624 --> 45:17.424
Don't say that. Don't...

45:17.434 --> 45:17.824
Don't say that,

45:19.526 --> 45:19.926
you hear me?

45:20.327 --> 45:21.094
That's not who you are.

45:21.161 --> 45:21.661
I never thought

45:22.563 --> 45:23.263
I could kill someone.

45:23.273 --> 45:23.663
Baby, I'll do anything

45:27.101 --> 45:27.368
for you.

45:27.635 --> 45:27.935
Anything.

45:33.942 --> 45:34.508
You just tell me.

45:38.614 --> 45:39.214
Just take me home.

45:42.418 --> 45:43.118
Please, take me home.

45:45.255 --> 45:46.088
Shane's still a fugitive.

45:46.422 --> 45:47.089
I was bringing a car

45:47.099 --> 45:47.790
and the money I ripped off

45:50.260 --> 45:51.127
from beltran's drug dealer

45:51.161 --> 45:51.661
when I saw them

45:55.032 --> 45:55.698
arresting corrine...

45:55.766 --> 45:56.232
...and I think

46:00.604 --> 46:01.104
that's the end.

46:07.311 --> 46:08.178
You've implicated gardocki

46:09.914 --> 46:10.380
in enough shit

46:10.515 --> 46:11.015
to put him away

46:12.918 --> 46:13.751
for the rest of his life.

46:16.488 --> 46:16.655
Yeah.

46:16.665 --> 46:17.222
But at least corrine's

46:18.490 --> 46:19.056
free of all this.

46:19.157 --> 46:19.624
Anyt less than

46:20.492 --> 46:21.192
the biggest drug bust

46:21.360 --> 46:22.127
this agency's ever seen

46:22.137 --> 46:22.727
will not be considered complete

46:24.964 --> 46:25.764
assistance on your part,

46:25.774 --> 46:26.197
and that will violate

46:27.733 --> 46:28.067
your deal.

46:28.368 --> 46:28.768
Don't worry.

46:28.778 --> 46:29.435
I'll give you beltran

46:31.104 --> 46:32.037
and his entire organization.

46:33.039 --> 46:33.872
You are our employee now.

46:33.939 --> 46:34.439
You do anything

46:34.808 --> 46:35.374
to warn ronnie ...

46:35.384 --> 46:36.042
You tell him to run ...

46:37.945 --> 46:38.878
That will violate your deal.

46:38.888 --> 46:39.512
You'll be prosecuted for

46:40.281 --> 46:41.147
everything you've told me.

46:41.448 --> 46:41.782
I need him

46:43.117 --> 46:43.817
to take down beltran.

46:43.827 --> 46:44.384
I'll string him along

46:48.956 --> 46:49.522
until we're done.

46:49.532 --> 46:49.923
You are a sick...

46:58.833 --> 46:59.233
Twisted man.

47:00.969 --> 47:01.435
Anything else?

47:05.974 --> 47:06.508
I got a meeting.

47:10.814 --> 47:11.480
Do you have any idea

47:14.583 --> 47:15.350
what you've done to me?

47:21.023 --> 47:21.557
I've done worse.

49:17.719 --> 49:20.386
Boss, we're two
continents behind schedule.

49:20.987 --> 49:21.721
Oh, hold your egg nog!

49:21.731 --> 49:23.656
I'm building my own
capital one credit card!

49:24.859 --> 49:25.626
I'll go with cash back,

49:26.927 --> 49:27.661
and a jolly good rate!

49:28.497 --> 49:30.931
But sir, the reindeer are getting antsy.

49:31.266 --> 49:33.966
Now I'm gonna upload a
photo from my beach house.

49:35.270 --> 49:36.803
Mrs. Claus is a lucky woman, sir.

49:37.705 --> 49:38.105
Yes, she is!

49:38.115 --> 49:40.374
Personalize your card
at capital one card lab.

49:40.384 --> 49:41.943
Choose your rewards, interest rate,

49:41.953 --> 49:44.312
even upload your own
image at capitalone.com.

51:45.878 --> 51:48.044
What's inyourwallet? Let's roll!
