00:30.239 --> 00:33.534
And remember,
don't give your heart to any boys.

00:34.159 --> 00:35.619
You're mine.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.120
Until you get married.

00:38.121 --> 00:39.665
Then you're still mine.

00:40.415 --> 00:42.251
Okay, Dad.

01:15.409 --> 01:16.618
Where are we going?

01:19.580 --> 01:21.081
It's gonna be fun. Come on.

02:11.173 --> 02:13.175
Nobody tells you
that once you get married,

02:13.258 --> 02:14.927
you will never fuck again.

02:15.719 --> 02:18.138
If you like fucking,
marriage ain't for you.

02:19.681 --> 02:21.725
Shit, I haven't fucked in seven years.

02:22.226 --> 02:23.685
I've had intercourse.

02:43.497 --> 02:44.498
Hi.

02:47.626 --> 02:48.627
Hi.

02:54.424 --> 02:55.425
Hi.

03:08.981 --> 03:11.608
-Mom, can I have some juice?
-Yes.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.485
-How was London?
-London was great.

03:13.569 --> 03:15.404
-Yeah?
-English guys are in for 20%.

03:15.487 --> 03:16.446
-Really?
-Yeah.

03:16.530 --> 03:17.698
-Well done.
-Thank you.

03:18.115 --> 03:21.660
We have to put a deposit down
on that house for July. That week in July.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.620
And I have to figure that out by tomorrow.

03:23.704 --> 03:27.124
Baby, I don't know what's happening then,
okay? Listen. But I'll check, okay?

03:27.207 --> 03:28.709
-Come here. Kisses. Come on.
-We're so late.

03:28.792 --> 03:31.670
And Jimmy's new restaurant.
Thursday or Friday?

03:31.753 --> 03:33.714
I just have to let him know
'cause they're really busy.

03:33.797 --> 03:34.631
Okay. Thursday.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.341
-Put your shoes on, please. Please.
-Bye.

03:36.425 --> 03:37.759
-I love you. Bye.
-Bye. Bye.

03:38.302 --> 03:39.678
-Come on, Theo.
-Hey.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.847
-Any more questions?
-Cute.

03:41.930 --> 03:44.224
-Please put your shoes on.
-I want the princess shoes.

03:44.308 --> 03:47.227
You gotta put your real shoes on.
We're so late, okay?

03:47.311 --> 03:48.437
-Okay.
-Okay.

03:48.896 --> 03:51.857
Okay. Sorry. Gotta go. Gotta go.

03:53.025 --> 03:54.026
Okay.

03:56.862 --> 03:58.739
-Did you finish your reading?
-Yeah.

03:58.822 --> 04:01.158
-Yeah?
-I finished my reading too.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.618
What? You did?

04:03.660 --> 04:06.163
-Mom, we're really late.
-Okay. Okay.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.540
-Hey, let's get coffee this weekend.
-Oh, yeah. For sure.

04:08.624 --> 04:11.543
Okay, okay.
Help Mommy, okay? Take your toy.

04:11.627 --> 04:12.878
Okay.

04:13.837 --> 04:15.047
I'll come fix it for you.

04:15.130 --> 04:16.214
Wait up for me!

04:18.216 --> 04:19.384
-Okay, have a good day.
-Bye.

04:19.468 --> 04:20.594
-Love you.
-Goodbye.

04:20.677 --> 04:21.720
-Bye. Bye.
-Bye.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.180
-Okay. Okay.
-Hi.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.973
-Hi.
-I know. I look awful.

04:25.057 --> 04:26.308
-No.
-I just had a peel.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.310
My face will be red and flaky for a week.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.604
But then it'll be so smooth,
you won't believe it.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.231
Okay. Okay. Let's go.

04:32.314 --> 04:34.942
Laura. What a stroke of luck.
Hi, little boo-boo.

04:35.859 --> 04:37.778
We need to have coffee.
I'm sure you don't have time.

04:37.861 --> 04:40.656
But we need to have coffee.
I'm seeing that guy again.

04:40.739 --> 04:42.324
-Are you?
-Yeah, it's happening.

04:42.407 --> 04:44.493
And I actually think it's fine.

04:44.576 --> 04:47.079
-Yeah.
-But for me, I cannot stop texting him.

04:47.162 --> 04:48.830
-Right.
-But then I text him, and I'm like,

04:48.914 --> 04:51.500
"I know that every time I text you,
I'm pushing you farther away."

04:51.583 --> 04:54.169
But then I do that, and I keep doing it.
I cannot stop myself.

04:54.253 --> 04:55.254
Right.

04:55.337 --> 04:59.174
And then I'm like, "Okay, you know what?
Be tender. Be tender with yourself."

04:59.258 --> 05:01.718
Because this is
a matter of the heart, you know?

05:01.802 --> 05:04.847
It's like,
we had an affair during Hurricane Sandy.

05:04.930 --> 05:07.099
Like, the entire thing is something

05:07.182 --> 05:10.477
that I'm trying to look at
with introspection and empathy. And--

05:10.561 --> 05:12.563
-I'm so sorry, but we actually have to go.
-Oh, no.

05:12.646 --> 05:15.023
-But I'll see you soon.
-I'm so sorry. I'll text you. Yeah.

05:15.107 --> 05:16.316
Okay. Bye.

05:20.112 --> 05:21.780
-Laura.
-Hi.

05:21.864 --> 05:22.906
Hi. I'm so late.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.950
-Okay. Talk to you later. Bye.
-Have a good one. Bye.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.034
Get in.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.372
Can you please
put on your seat belt for me?

05:32.583 --> 05:34.168
Read me another story.

05:34.835 --> 05:35.836
Go to sleep.

05:40.549 --> 05:42.384
-Can I ask you a weird question?
-Sure.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.303
Well, last night Dean got back.

05:44.386 --> 05:47.347
He was really out of it.
He takes Xanax on the plane.

05:48.849 --> 05:53.604
And he started kissing me,
and then he heard my voice.

05:53.687 --> 05:57.816
And it was like I woke him up.
He was surprised and stopped.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.069
It was almost like
he thought I was someone else.

06:01.153 --> 06:02.154
What?

06:03.071 --> 06:06.325
That's weird. But he was just out of it.

06:06.408 --> 06:07.701
Yeah, I guess.

06:07.784 --> 06:10.621
He's such a good guy. And he adores you.

06:11.163 --> 06:14.374
You know, he's traveling
with clients all the time, and...

06:15.209 --> 06:18.629
I'm just the buzzkill
waiting to schedule things. I--

06:19.338 --> 06:20.756
I can't even write.

06:21.089 --> 06:23.926
I should've never
sold a book before writing it.

06:24.009 --> 06:27.346
That's okay.
Give yourself a break. You have a toddler.

06:29.223 --> 06:31.433
And you'll get back to work
when you're ready.

07:37.583 --> 07:38.876
-All right, hang on.
-Yeah.

07:40.711 --> 07:42.004
I can hear you now.

07:42.087 --> 07:44.506
What do you think...
from a man's point of view?

07:46.091 --> 07:47.301
Am I crazy?

07:47.384 --> 07:50.095
No. He thought you were someone else.

07:50.179 --> 07:51.722
What? You think so?

07:51.805 --> 07:52.806
Absolutely.

07:54.057 --> 07:57.811
You're just dark and don't know anything
about a committed relationship.

07:57.895 --> 07:58.979
Really?

07:59.062 --> 08:00.063
Yes, really.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.524
You need to start thinking like a man.

08:02.608 --> 08:03.650
Felix!

08:03.734 --> 08:05.485
Thanks, Dad. That's really helpful.

08:06.236 --> 08:07.821
Is that a birthmark?

08:07.905 --> 08:11.074
You know, I don't know why
I asked you of all people. Never mind.

08:11.700 --> 08:13.493
If you need me, I'm here.

08:13.577 --> 08:14.578
Hang on, shorty.

08:20.709 --> 08:21.793
You there, shorty?

08:22.586 --> 08:25.380
Enjoy Paris. Have a French 76 for me.

08:25.464 --> 08:30.427
I can try. Call if you need anything.
I'll be back soon. I love you.

08:30.511 --> 08:31.512
Bye.

08:37.351 --> 08:39.852
Mommy! Mommy!

08:41.605 --> 08:43.148
Time for the llama's haircut?

08:43.232 --> 08:45.692
No. I have to wash her first.

08:47.653 --> 08:48.779
It's okay.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.160
First, I'm gonna give you a bath.

09:07.005 --> 09:08.340
We're gonna clean you up.

09:15.389 --> 09:17.140
I'm gonna brush your hair.

09:23.272 --> 09:25.941
I'm brushing your hair, little llama.

09:26.024 --> 09:28.485
Brush, brush, brush.

09:28.569 --> 09:30.988
Will I see you and the girls this weekend?

09:31.071 --> 09:33.156
-Your mother and sister are coming.
-Theo.

09:33.240 --> 09:37.286
You know what, Gran?
Can I-- Can I just call you back?

09:37.369 --> 09:39.413
I'm taking Theo to a class.

09:39.496 --> 09:40.497
See you then.

09:40.581 --> 09:43.375
Three, four, five, six.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.378
Got it. Good job.

09:49.381 --> 09:55.762
Wheels on the bus go round and round
All over town

09:55.846 --> 09:58.765
The horn on the bus goes
Beep, beep, beep

09:58.849 --> 10:00.684
-Hi.
-Beep, beep, beep

10:00.767 --> 10:01.894
Beep, beep, beep

10:08.192 --> 10:09.484
Head back. Head back.

10:10.152 --> 10:12.613
Face me. Face me. Face this way.
Here.

10:16.617 --> 10:17.784
I love you.

10:17.868 --> 10:20.746
Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream

10:21.538 --> 10:24.917
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
Life is but a dream

10:47.940 --> 10:50.067
-There you guys are. Hi. Cheers.
-Hi.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.151
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

10:51.235 --> 10:53.445
Hard at work, I see. Cheers, cheers.

10:53.529 --> 10:55.948
Love what you're wearing.
You're looking so hot.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.909
How's the food? Is it good? Is it good?

10:58.992 --> 11:00.202
-Hi.
-Hey.

11:00.285 --> 11:01.286
You look good.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.038
Thanks.

11:04.206 --> 11:05.290
Here. Meet the team.

11:05.374 --> 11:06.375
Team.

11:08.252 --> 11:10.754
-Oh, my God. Hi. You must be Laura.
-Baby, this is the team.

11:10.838 --> 11:11.880
Hey. Yeah.

11:11.964 --> 11:14.967
-Fiona. So good to finally meet you.
-I'll be right back.

11:15.050 --> 11:18.136
I'm sorry. Dean must've told you, there's
just so much going on here right now.

11:18.220 --> 11:20.556
-Yeah.
-Yeah, it's crazy with the--

11:20.639 --> 11:23.517
with the new offices opening
and everything, and--

11:25.602 --> 11:29.356
I heard that the guys from A24 were here.
I have to go speak with them.

11:30.649 --> 11:32.985
We just started working with the Ghosts.
Have you seen them?

11:33.068 --> 11:35.487
-No.
-Yeah. They're actually really good.

11:39.324 --> 11:40.826
Well, can I get you something?

11:40.909 --> 11:42.369
-I think I'm fine for now.
-Great.

11:42.452 --> 11:45.497
Jenna, Chase, this is Laura, Dean's wife.

11:45.581 --> 11:47.040
-Hi.
-Be right back.

11:47.124 --> 11:48.250
-Hi.
-Hi.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.460
So... you work here?

11:51.670 --> 11:54.590
Yeah.
I started a few months ago, so...

11:54.673 --> 11:57.176
Cool. Are you liking it so far?

11:58.218 --> 11:59.678
Yeah. Yeah.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.099
Dean's really great to work with.

12:05.809 --> 12:06.810
Great.

12:12.024 --> 12:15.694
Congrats! Guys! 500K!

12:16.862 --> 12:18.989
-Well done, team!
-Congrats.

12:19.072 --> 12:22.492
Five hundred K. It's all you. How sweet.

12:23.202 --> 12:24.286
All of us.

12:24.369 --> 12:26.413
-Thank you, guys. Thank you.
-Thank you.

12:26.496 --> 12:27.372
Yeah.

12:27.915 --> 12:29.041
-Well done.
-Thank you.

12:29.124 --> 12:31.919
-We made it this...
-Really did...

12:32.002 --> 12:33.045
I know.

12:33.629 --> 12:34.630
Great party.

12:34.713 --> 12:36.632
Told you
the party would go smoothly.

12:36.715 --> 12:38.550
-Why didn't you trust me?
-Okay.

12:38.634 --> 12:39.843
-All right!
-Bye!

12:41.512 --> 12:43.388
Babe, what a night.

12:43.805 --> 12:46.725
Five hundred thousand new followers.
We're killing it.

12:46.808 --> 12:50.187
The amount of engagement, the insight.
I mean, this is crazy.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.522
I mean...

12:51.605 --> 12:55.943
between our briefs, our team, the amount
of, like, the ROIs, return on investments,

12:56.026 --> 12:57.444
we're crushing it.

12:57.528 --> 12:58.946
-So great.
-Yeah.

13:01.615 --> 13:03.283
-Can I ask you something?
-Yeah.

13:05.202 --> 13:11.917
I found a woman's toiletry case
when I was unpacking your bag.

13:14.837 --> 13:15.963
That's Fiona's.

13:18.048 --> 13:21.093
She couldn't fit it in her carry-on,
so I put it in my luggage.

13:21.176 --> 13:22.761
I must've forgot about it, so...

13:24.096 --> 13:26.139
-Right.
-Yeah.

13:26.223 --> 13:29.142
I'll just bring it to her
tomorrow at the office. Thank you.

13:44.867 --> 13:48.370
Let me have it. Let me have it.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.581
Okay, okay. Ready.

13:51.039 --> 13:52.791
Did anyone see my brush?

13:52.875 --> 13:54.376
We're going to see Grandma.

13:54.459 --> 13:55.586
And Mommy's grandma.

13:55.669 --> 13:57.171
-Bye, babies.
-Bye.

13:57.254 --> 13:58.338
-Bye.
-Say bye.

13:58.422 --> 14:00.799
-Bye. Love you.
-Love you.

14:00.883 --> 14:03.552
-Have fun with your family.
-Yeah, right. Thanks.

14:03.635 --> 14:06.054
-Okay. Try to have fun with your family.
-Okay.

14:06.138 --> 14:08.140
Love you. If you need me,
I'll be at the office.

14:08.223 --> 14:09.224
-Okay.
-All right?

14:09.933 --> 14:10.934
Say bye.

14:11.018 --> 14:12.477
-Bye, girls.
-Bye.

14:12.561 --> 14:14.271
-I love you.
-Bye. Love you.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.355
Love you.

14:15.439 --> 14:16.440
-Bye.
-You too.

14:16.523 --> 14:17.649
Bye.

14:17.733 --> 14:21.320
-Hey, Gran. How are you?
-So glad you're here.

14:21.403 --> 14:26.491
I laid out on the terrace last night
looking at the stars. It was glorious.

14:26.575 --> 14:27.993
That's so nice.

14:29.578 --> 14:32.164
How's the apartment?
Did you finish the bedroom?

14:32.247 --> 14:35.334
They just finished, and it is so cheerful.

14:35.417 --> 14:40.214
I could be in there with five blizzards
and not get depressed.

14:40.297 --> 14:41.673
That's so nice.

14:41.757 --> 14:45.093
I just got a luscious cream rug
from Cogolin.

14:46.845 --> 14:48.055
You know, Laura...

14:48.889 --> 14:53.018
if you're going to dress that way,
you could make more of an effort.

14:53.101 --> 14:55.103
Please, Gran, I think she looks terrific.

14:55.521 --> 14:57.731
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

14:57.814 --> 15:00.692
I talked to Dad the other day.
He's in Paris.

15:00.776 --> 15:02.528
How is Felix?

15:02.611 --> 15:05.364
You know, his usual chipper self.

15:05.447 --> 15:06.615
I wonder what he's up to.

15:06.698 --> 15:09.910
Well, he does keep himself amused.

15:10.994 --> 15:13.705
He was always a handful,
since he was a little boy.

15:13.789 --> 15:16.792
He could never stay put for very long.

15:16.875 --> 15:18.794
Never really knew what he was thinking.

15:19.628 --> 15:21.004
I don't know how you can deal with him.

15:23.298 --> 15:24.842
Your father owes me a visit.

15:27.427 --> 15:30.764
Is Dean still traveling a lot
with that new assistant?

15:32.724 --> 15:33.809
Account manager.

15:34.226 --> 15:35.727
Yeah. She's--

15:36.103 --> 15:37.437
Yeah, she seems nice.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.439
She very attractive?

15:39.523 --> 15:42.526
I don't know.
I mean-- Yeah, she's attractive.

15:44.778 --> 15:47.322
New York is filled
with attractive women though.

15:47.739 --> 15:49.449
Well, okay.

15:50.576 --> 15:51.785
French fry?

15:51.869 --> 15:53.328
No. Thank you.

15:53.787 --> 15:54.997
They're so good.

15:58.208 --> 15:59.209
Come on.

16:01.545 --> 16:04.965
-Come on, Maya! Come on!
-You better not use my markers.

16:05.048 --> 16:07.426
-Mom says you have to share.
-Mom!

16:58.101 --> 16:59.895
Mom, she's pulling my hair!

17:01.104 --> 17:02.731
Don't do that! Stop!

17:03.148 --> 17:05.358
She's hurting me, Mom, Dad!

17:05.733 --> 17:06.733
Mommy!

17:07.528 --> 17:09.530
-Mommy!
-To be continued.

17:11.781 --> 17:13.200
Where's my toothbrush?

17:13.575 --> 17:15.742
Mom, did you remember
to check my homework?

17:16.368 --> 17:19.748
-Yes. It's on the bench in the hallway.
-Can you pick up my little guy?

17:19.829 --> 17:21.333
He's trying to get you.

17:22.709 --> 17:23.710
Brush, please.

17:24.127 --> 17:25.627
-Please brush.
-Okay.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.172
-Go get your book bag.
-Okay.

17:27.256 --> 17:28.674
Rinse, rinse, rinse.

17:30.467 --> 17:32.135
-Thank you.
-Hurry up!

17:33.178 --> 17:34.555
Can I have a cookie? Can I have a cookie?

17:34.638 --> 17:37.766
No, you cannot have a cookie.
We just had breakfast.

17:37.850 --> 17:40.769
And it's not just, like, a sexual thing.

17:40.853 --> 17:42.813
Because he's coming to me.

17:42.896 --> 17:44.773
I'm the one with the ideas
for our company.

17:44.857 --> 17:46.692
-Right.
-You know? And this whole thing started

17:46.775 --> 17:49.653
because I was like, "You know what?
Why are nails not more ornamental?"

17:49.736 --> 17:52.614
Obviously, they're functional. We need
them to hold our furniture together.

17:52.698 --> 17:54.700
But, you know, I was like,
"It's about these small details

17:54.783 --> 17:57.119
that actually aren't just details.
They can be treasures."

17:57.202 --> 17:59.621
And he was like, "That was really--
That's really inspiring."

17:59.705 --> 18:03.375
In fact, just having this conversation
is how we ended up being together.

18:03.458 --> 18:05.210
-Okay, see you later.
-Okay, bye, bye, bye.

18:07.337 --> 18:10.048
One, two, three,

18:10.132 --> 18:14.011
four, five, six, eight.

18:14.094 --> 18:19.266
...twinkle, little star
Like a diamond in the...

18:41.788 --> 18:42.789
Hey, kiddo.

18:45.083 --> 18:46.460
Feel like hopping in?

18:46.543 --> 18:47.794
Feel like scooting over?

18:51.840 --> 18:52.966
Hi, Dad.

18:54.927 --> 18:56.470
You can still break my ribs.

18:56.553 --> 18:59.556
-Hi, Musto.
-Hi, Laura. Nice to see you.

19:00.807 --> 19:03.769
Mus, you know that this one
is named after the song...

19:03.852 --> 19:09.274
Laura is the face in the misty night

19:09.900 --> 19:12.611
Footsteps that you hear down the hall

19:12.694 --> 19:13.862
You know this one, Musto?

19:13.946 --> 19:18.242
The laugh, Musto
That floats on a summer night

19:18.325 --> 19:23.705
That you can never quite recall

19:23.789 --> 19:25.999
-It's one of my favorites.
-Lead part, please.

19:30.003 --> 19:32.214
-I can't whistle.
-Come on.

19:32.798 --> 19:33.882
No, seriously.

19:38.178 --> 19:41.139
No, I can't anymore.
It's so weird. Ever since I had kids.

19:41.223 --> 19:43.684
No kid of mine is gonna stop whistling.

19:44.893 --> 19:46.478
We're working on this. Come on.

19:49.189 --> 19:50.399
Nice bracelet.

19:50.482 --> 19:51.483
Thank you.

19:52.693 --> 19:56.822
The bangle is a reminder
that women were once men's property.

19:57.322 --> 20:00.033
I'm sure that's exactly
what Dean was going for.

20:04.413 --> 20:06.164
Do you think I'm underdressed?

20:06.248 --> 20:07.875
You just show 'em your cute mug.

20:13.755 --> 20:15.591
Oh, my gosh, do you look beautiful.

20:18.177 --> 20:19.678
You're about to see Cliff.

20:20.596 --> 20:23.432
-Hello, Mr. Keane.
-Cliff. How's your mom's hip?

20:23.515 --> 20:24.975
-Good, thanks.
-Good.

20:25.058 --> 20:28.729
You tell her to do her exercises or she
may as well have kept the old one.

20:29.855 --> 20:31.231
Good afternoon, Mr. Keane.

20:31.315 --> 20:32.900
He thinks you're my girlfriend.

20:37.070 --> 20:40.908
Hey, I'll have a Cutty on the rocks
and a Bombay martini for the kid.

20:42.284 --> 20:43.410
Okay.

20:46.538 --> 20:47.956
You know what's interesting?

20:48.540 --> 20:51.585
Back when humans walked on all fours,

20:52.544 --> 20:57.174
it was the sight of the female haunches
that excited them.

20:57.966 --> 21:01.261
So that when
we finally stood up on two legs,

21:01.345 --> 21:05.682
it was the women with the rounded breasts
that mirrored the haunches

21:05.766 --> 21:07.935
that were most exciting to the males.

21:08.018 --> 21:10.395
So, they made babies with them,

21:10.479 --> 21:14.399
and eventually, that shape
evolved into what is our modern female.

21:14.483 --> 21:15.859
Wow.

21:15.943 --> 21:19.780
And men were attracted
to adolescent females

21:19.863 --> 21:23.867
because they were easier to catch,
therefore ultimately easier to mate.

21:25.160 --> 21:27.746
And slowly over time, these qualities...

21:28.622 --> 21:29.831
small size...

21:31.416 --> 21:32.709
smooth skin...

21:33.669 --> 21:34.920
high voice...

21:35.379 --> 21:37.089
little or no beard...

21:38.340 --> 21:41.134
evolved into the qualities
most desired today.

21:41.844 --> 21:44.847
So they prefer no beard? Good to know.

21:44.930 --> 21:46.306
Like you.

21:48.559 --> 21:49.560
Thank you.

21:52.980 --> 21:53.981
Ballet dancer.

21:56.108 --> 21:58.110
Yes. I studied at the Bolshoi.

22:02.030 --> 22:04.741
Dad, can we order? 'Cause I gotta get back
and pick up the kids.

22:04.825 --> 22:05.826
Sure.

22:06.535 --> 22:08.871
I'll have the rib eye,
well done, with spinach.

22:09.246 --> 22:11.582
I'll have the chopped salad, please.
Thank you.

22:14.376 --> 22:17.880
Can you ever just act normal
around any woman?

22:18.505 --> 22:21.133
She's a ballet dancer.
They love to be complimented.

22:24.136 --> 22:26.597
So, do you miss having the gallery?

22:26.680 --> 22:29.725
No.
I still have the odd deal here and there.

22:30.142 --> 22:32.686
Did I tell you I got a new assistant?
Few days.

22:32.769 --> 22:33.979
That's good.

22:36.231 --> 22:37.900
You know what's great about her?

22:39.318 --> 22:42.446
She doesn't talk. She just listens.

22:42.529 --> 22:44.823
That sounds perfect for you.

22:46.867 --> 22:49.703
So Dean's going away a lot?
On business trips?

22:49.786 --> 22:52.789
Dad, not everyone is like you.

22:52.873 --> 22:56.293
Where was he coming back from
when he was acting so strange?

22:56.376 --> 22:58.128
-London.
-London.

22:59.588 --> 23:00.589
Where was he staying?

23:01.173 --> 23:03.634
I think it was Blakes?

23:03.717 --> 23:07.095
-Blakes?
-Blakes. Yeah. Why?

23:08.013 --> 23:09.473
Blakes is a

23:09.932 --> 23:15.229
cozy, little off-the-beaten-track hotel

23:15.312 --> 23:18.732
that I wouldn't stay at
if I were on a business trip.

23:24.780 --> 23:30.744
I know a concierge over at Claridge's.
He knows all the concierges.

23:31.620 --> 23:32.704
When was he there?

23:33.455 --> 23:36.959
Last week,
but let's not get carried away, okay?

23:42.381 --> 23:43.799
There was something.

23:45.092 --> 23:46.093
What?

23:49.263 --> 23:50.264
Never mind.

23:52.516 --> 23:53.809
What?

23:58.021 --> 23:59.147
There were some...

24:00.774 --> 24:03.819
There were some of his
coworker's toiletries in his luggage.

24:04.403 --> 24:05.696
Sloppy move.

24:05.779 --> 24:10.117
But she couldn't put them
in her carry-on through security,

24:10.200 --> 24:13.245
so he offered to put them in his luggage.
That's it.

24:13.787 --> 24:16.290
Raise your hand if that sounds fishy.

24:16.373 --> 24:19.251
You know what?
I shouldn't have said anything. Forget it.

24:19.334 --> 24:21.545
-Have you checked his phone?
-No.

24:21.628 --> 24:24.506
Well, do yourself a favor,
check his text messages.

24:24.590 --> 24:29.511
If it's-- I mean, it may come to nothing,
but, you know, may as well make sure.

24:29.595 --> 24:31.889
Dean is not like you.

24:31.972 --> 24:34.600
Okay, he's a nerd.
He's a good guy. A great dad.

24:34.683 --> 24:36.810
He's a man. It's nature.

24:37.853 --> 24:43.734
Males are forced to fight to dominate
and to impregnate all females.

24:51.283 --> 24:52.326
Sorry.

24:53.493 --> 24:56.246
I remember the first time
I saw your mother.

24:56.330 --> 25:00.292
It was a beach party.
Back then, all the girls wore bikinis.

25:01.001 --> 25:06.465
Your mother walked out of the ocean
in a white one-piece swimming suit,

25:07.132 --> 25:09.009
and that was it for me. I was done.

25:10.385 --> 25:11.553
Staying on track...

25:12.930 --> 25:15.140
what does Dean have planned
for your birthday?

25:16.016 --> 25:17.893
He's not gonna be here for my birthday.

25:17.976 --> 25:21.146
What kind of guy
forgets his wife's birthday?

25:21.230 --> 25:22.523
He didn't forget.

25:22.606 --> 25:25.150
He has a work trip, but we're gonna
celebrate when he gets back.

25:25.234 --> 25:26.401
That's not the same.

25:28.237 --> 25:31.532
I traveled. I never missed a birthday.

25:31.615 --> 25:34.910
Right.
But you had some other shortcomings.

25:38.038 --> 25:39.081
Like what?

25:43.961 --> 25:44.962
Thank you.

25:51.844 --> 25:53.554
All right, I'm gonna take you to 21.

25:54.012 --> 25:56.348
Just do me a favor.
Check his texts, will you?

25:57.015 --> 25:59.852
And if there's anything else
you can think about London...

26:02.354 --> 26:05.232
At some point, we can make a decision
about whether to tap his phone.

26:05.315 --> 26:07.359
-No.
-Laura, come on.

26:07.442 --> 26:09.862
He should be worshipping
the ground you walk on,

26:09.945 --> 26:12.489
and if he's not, you need to know.

26:14.491 --> 26:16.201
Now, it's probably nothing, but...

26:23.750 --> 26:25.002
check his phone.

26:27.254 --> 26:28.714
Do I swim?

26:28.797 --> 26:29.882
Yes.

26:29.965 --> 26:31.758
Am I green?

26:31.842 --> 26:33.051
-Yes.
-Yes.

26:33.135 --> 26:36.305
Do I make this noise? Gribbit.

26:37.139 --> 26:38.265
Yes.

26:39.975 --> 26:42.269
No? Yes?

26:42.352 --> 26:43.854
Hey, did you change your password?

26:43.937 --> 26:45.314
You're sometimes green.

26:45.397 --> 26:48.483
I was trying to send
that cute picture of the girls to my mom.

26:50.027 --> 26:53.780
Yeah, there's a new
security protocol at work.

26:53.864 --> 26:57.159
They just change it up
for some reason, so... Here.

26:58.327 --> 27:00.370
You sure you don't wanna use your phone?

27:00.454 --> 27:02.122
No, I don't have that picture.

27:02.497 --> 27:03.874
-Okay.
-Thanks.

27:05.792 --> 27:06.793
-You good?
-Yeah.

27:06.877 --> 27:07.711
Okay.

27:07.794 --> 27:09.129
All right, girls. Daddy gotta get to work.

27:09.213 --> 27:10.797
-Bye.
-Gimme a kiss.

27:12.049 --> 27:13.884
Hey, be nice. And be nice to Mommy.

27:13.967 --> 27:15.093
-Bye, Daddy.
-I love you.

27:15.177 --> 27:16.637
-Love you.
-Love you.

27:17.179 --> 27:19.640
Sorry I'm not gonna be here
for your birthday.

27:19.723 --> 27:21.642
-I'll make it up soon as I get back, okay?
-Yeah.

27:21.725 --> 27:22.726
-All right.
-Okay.

27:23.685 --> 27:24.561
-Bye.
-Bye.

27:24.645 --> 27:26.855
I need to have some for breakfast.

27:29.024 --> 27:31.944
No! Definitely no.

27:50.170 --> 27:51.380
Grandpa!

27:52.214 --> 27:53.632
You can still fly.

27:54.466 --> 27:56.176
Where can I toss you folks out?

27:56.260 --> 27:57.261
Ready?

27:58.178 --> 28:00.806
-My God.
-We're going to ballet. 51 Walker Street.

28:00.889 --> 28:03.183
I'd love to.
You been working on your whistling?

28:03.267 --> 28:04.518
Not really.

28:04.601 --> 28:05.602
Shove over, tiny.

28:05.686 --> 28:08.522
-Hi, Musto.
-Hi, guys. Nice to see you again.

28:08.605 --> 28:09.898
You too.

28:09.982 --> 28:11.441
Honey, put your seat belt on.

28:12.067 --> 28:14.361
-All right, let's take it from the top.
-Okay.

28:16.572 --> 28:18.365
Emerald City. As quick as lightning.

28:18.448 --> 28:19.449
Just, like, air.

28:19.533 --> 28:22.911
It helps to have a little bit more belly.
Try to get it from the belly.

28:26.164 --> 28:27.583
It's useless.

28:28.208 --> 28:29.334
I'm sorry, hey.

28:29.418 --> 28:31.587
Sorry. Wanna go say hi?

28:31.670 --> 28:34.173
You did a really great job today.
Great job.

28:34.673 --> 28:36.383
-Hey.
-Hi.

28:36.758 --> 28:37.968
Hi.

28:38.051 --> 28:39.052
Hi.

28:39.136 --> 28:41.555
Maya, my precious.

28:42.598 --> 28:45.809
It's been too long.
I can't live without you.

28:46.143 --> 28:48.187
Are you gonna come take my class? Hey.

28:48.645 --> 28:49.938
You're in fourth position.

28:51.231 --> 28:52.608
Yeah. Yeah.

28:52.691 --> 28:54.026
Dad, this is Miss Mindy.

28:54.109 --> 28:56.111
Hello, Miss Mindy.

28:56.862 --> 28:58.697
-Goodbye, Miss Mindy. Thank you.
-Okay.

28:58.780 --> 29:00.073
-See you next week.
-Bye, Miss Mindy.

29:00.157 --> 29:01.867
-Say bye, Maya. Okay.
-Bye.

29:05.078 --> 29:08.749
Right this way, ladies. Ladies and ladies.

29:10.709 --> 29:12.753
-Musto, pull over a second.
-You got it.

29:12.836 --> 29:15.839
I want a unicorn balloon.
Yeah, yeah, the unicorn.

29:16.089 --> 29:18.717
A, you're adorable

29:18.800 --> 29:21.428
-B, you're so beautiful
-Come on, guys.

29:21.512 --> 29:25.307
-C, you're a cutie full of charm
-Okay.

29:25.390 --> 29:27.976
I'm gonna jump in the shower quick.
Can you just watch them?

29:28.060 --> 29:28.894
-Sure.
-Come on.

29:28.977 --> 29:30.854
-D, you're delightful
-You wanna watch something?

29:30.938 --> 29:33.357
-And E, you're exciting
-Let's go.

29:33.440 --> 29:37.361
And F, you smell like you own a farm

29:45.577 --> 29:47.246
Does my foot smell funny?

29:48.497 --> 29:51.375
-'Cause I was wondering--
-We're watching Breaking Bad.

29:51.458 --> 29:53.168
-What?
-It's really good.

29:53.252 --> 29:54.962
It's a great show. Have you seen it?

29:55.045 --> 29:58.048
Yes, I have seen it.
It's great. It's not for kids.

29:58.131 --> 30:00.008
What? Was there something bad on?

30:00.092 --> 30:01.552
No.

30:01.635 --> 30:03.512
-Yeah.
-Hey, look, I can shuffle.

30:04.513 --> 30:06.098
Wow. That's great.

30:06.181 --> 30:10.811
We learned that all young girls
should know how to shuffle. And how to...

30:10.894 --> 30:12.104
Bluff.

30:12.521 --> 30:14.189
Bluff. Right.

30:14.273 --> 30:15.357
And how do you bluff?

30:15.440 --> 30:17.234
-Poker face.
-Poker face.

30:18.026 --> 30:19.027
Poker face.

30:19.903 --> 30:20.904
Poker face.

30:21.321 --> 30:22.781
Nice, nice.

30:24.241 --> 30:27.035
And that girls should wear their hair
long and pretty, how boys like it.

30:27.119 --> 30:31.123
Or you can wear it short,
or however you wanna wear it.

30:31.206 --> 30:33.208
-Long and pretty.
-Long and pretty.

30:33.750 --> 30:35.335
Don't listen to him, okay?

30:35.419 --> 30:38.630
You're gonna grow up,
and you're gonna be strong women

30:38.714 --> 30:41.049
who get to wear their hair
however they like.

30:41.550 --> 30:43.886
Now it's dinnertime.
What were you drinking?

30:43.969 --> 30:45.304
We made egg creams.

30:45.387 --> 30:49.141
You were all out of Fox's U-bet.
But we made do.

30:49.641 --> 30:51.560
This is not good before dinner.

30:52.144 --> 30:53.979
Well, nobody wants one after dinner.

30:54.062 --> 30:55.063
Yeah.

30:55.147 --> 30:58.192
Time to wash our hands.
Let's go. Dinnertime.

30:58.275 --> 31:00.152
Let's get going. Jump over. Jump.

31:00.861 --> 31:02.321
Wash your feet too.

31:02.404 --> 31:06.116
You two guys drop food on the floor
too much.

31:06.200 --> 31:07.534
And it's wasteful.

31:07.618 --> 31:09.995
Clean toes, pop that back into your mouth.

31:10.078 --> 31:12.581
Ten-second rule. Learn to respect it.

31:13.707 --> 31:14.917
Can we have burgers?

31:15.000 --> 31:16.251
All right, I'm off.

31:16.335 --> 31:18.045
We're gonna talk
about your birthday tomorrow?

31:18.128 --> 31:19.796
Oh, yeah.

31:19.880 --> 31:23.258
Actually, I don't really feel like
celebrating my birthday this year.

31:23.342 --> 31:27.846
The celebration of the date of one's birth
was originally a pagan tradition.

31:28.347 --> 31:31.934
Historically, Christians didn't celebrate
for that very reason.

31:32.017 --> 31:33.727
Now, we're past that, aren't we?

31:34.728 --> 31:39.650
Kids. Do you want a mom who doesn't want
to get taken out for cake and ice cream?

31:39.733 --> 31:40.984
-Ice cream. Ice cream!
-Ice cream!

31:41.068 --> 31:43.362
-I just don't feel like it, okay?
-Please?

31:43.445 --> 31:44.988
We'll talk tomorrow, okay?

31:45.072 --> 31:46.823
-I love you all.
-Love you.

31:46.907 --> 31:50.452
The biggest one the most
and then in descending order.

31:50.994 --> 31:52.454
Keep up the good work.

31:52.955 --> 31:54.248
Bye, Grandpa!

31:54.331 --> 31:55.541
Bye, Grandpa.

31:58.585 --> 32:01.380
Hey, Felix. You're back in town.

32:01.463 --> 32:03.131
-I am.
-Yes, you are.

32:04.007 --> 32:05.092
Been busy?

32:05.175 --> 32:07.594
Yeah. Got a lot going on.

32:08.345 --> 32:09.346
Do you?

32:10.055 --> 32:11.056
Yeah.

32:12.015 --> 32:13.350
-Well.
-You good?

32:13.809 --> 32:15.352
-Yeah, I'm good.
-All right.

32:16.812 --> 32:18.605
-You?
-I'm great.

32:21.316 --> 32:23.068
-Good night.
-Good night.

32:29.867 --> 32:30.868
Where to?

32:33.620 --> 32:34.705
Let's go home.

33:26.965 --> 33:28.091
Here you go. Thank you.

33:29.885 --> 33:32.679
So, do you want anything
back from Los Angeles?

33:32.763 --> 33:34.598
Where do I start?

33:34.681 --> 33:36.350
Sounds expensive.

33:36.433 --> 33:37.726
-Love you.
-Love you.

33:37.809 --> 33:39.144
Hey, cheer up.

33:40.938 --> 33:41.939
-Bye.
-Bye, Dad.

33:43.440 --> 33:44.483
Have fun.

33:44.942 --> 33:46.902
-Bye.
-Can't have fun without you guys.

33:47.945 --> 33:49.404
That's my reality right now.

33:49.821 --> 33:54.451
And actually, now that I think about it,
perhaps she did show me some strength,

33:54.535 --> 33:57.037
because here I am,
standing in my own power.

33:57.663 --> 34:00.582
Those flowers are pretty. Wow.

34:00.666 --> 34:04.628
Wow. So pretty. Look at these flowers.

34:04.711 --> 34:07.297
-You can pull them out if you want to.
-They're so nice.

34:07.381 --> 34:10.300
-Yeah, if you wanna pull them out--
-Do you think they're from Daddy?

34:10.384 --> 34:11.552
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

34:12.553 --> 34:13.971
They're from my daddy.

34:17.391 --> 34:20.726
"Behind the speaker's platform
hung an oil painting, richly framed,

34:20.811 --> 34:26.525
depicting the mouse in Aesop's fable in
its heroic act of freeing a captive lion.

34:27.109 --> 34:28.819
Well, it's like this"--

34:30.152 --> 34:31.196
Look, it's Daddy.

34:38.620 --> 34:42.040
-Hi. Hi.
-Hi. Hi, birthday girl.

34:42.123 --> 34:43.125
Hi, babies.

34:43.208 --> 34:44.042
-Hi.
-Hi.

34:44.126 --> 34:45.543
Greetings from Hollywood.

34:46.210 --> 34:47.212
How's your birthday?

34:47.838 --> 34:50.174
Good. It's pretty mellow.
It's really nice.

34:50.257 --> 34:51.675
Nice. Good.

34:51.757 --> 34:55.179
Babies, go get the gift
that we wrapped for Mommy.

34:55.971 --> 34:57.054
I'm gonna get it.

34:57.139 --> 34:59.933
-Miss you guys so much.
-Miss you too.

35:00.392 --> 35:02.352
That's sneaky.

35:02.436 --> 35:04.396
-You guys planned this?
-Just a little.

35:04.479 --> 35:05.856
Do you think she's gonna like it?

35:05.939 --> 35:07.900
-You look good.
-Thanks.

35:07.983 --> 35:09.484
-How's it going?
-It's right there.

35:09.568 --> 35:10.819
Miss that little smile.

35:13.322 --> 35:17.117
Okay, now listen, the gift, I want you
to understand, it's a little different.

35:17.201 --> 35:20.078
What is this enormous box?

35:20.162 --> 35:21.955
It's nerdy, but it's actually really cool.

35:22.039 --> 35:23.498
Is this-- Do you wanna come help Mommy?

35:23.582 --> 35:25.626
-Here, you take that.
-The girls helped me wrap it.

35:25.709 --> 35:28.086
-Okay. Okay. Yeah.
-Got to take the tie off.

35:28.170 --> 35:30.380
-Start with the ribbon.
-Gonna help her open it?

35:30.464 --> 35:32.466
Baby, back up so I can see Mommy.

35:32.549 --> 35:34.092
What is it?

35:35.928 --> 35:37.513
All right, so this is different.

35:39.014 --> 35:40.015
Thermomix.

35:40.098 --> 35:42.309
Twelve different appliances
all rolled in one.

35:43.101 --> 35:48.023
It does, like, mixing, weighing,
kneading, chopping, everything.

35:48.106 --> 35:50.901
But, you know what,
it's perfect for, like, making things.

35:50.984 --> 35:53.612
Hey, guys,
you gonna make Mommy a big birthday pizza?

35:53.695 --> 35:55.447
-Yes.
-Yes.

35:55.531 --> 35:56.657
Thank you.

35:56.740 --> 36:00.452
There's one more part to your present,
but it's not ready yet. Okay?

36:00.536 --> 36:02.788
Can I call you back? I'm sorry.

36:02.871 --> 36:04.998
You know what, I got meetings.
I'll call you later. I love you.

36:05.082 --> 36:06.250
Bye. Love you.

36:08.794 --> 36:09.795
Hello?

36:09.878 --> 36:11.088
I'm down here.

36:12.673 --> 36:14.675
What? I told you I wasn't coming.

36:15.259 --> 36:17.052
Buzz me in.

36:17.135 --> 36:18.887
Yeah? Mama!

36:18.971 --> 36:20.806
Stop being so annoying.

36:22.099 --> 36:23.517
Get back in bed.

36:28.564 --> 36:30.190
Mommy.

36:30.274 --> 36:32.484
-Good night. Love you.
-Good night, Mom. Happy birthday.

36:32.568 --> 36:33.569
Thank you, honey.

36:36.280 --> 36:37.781
What are you...

36:38.866 --> 36:43.245
I'm taking you out.
You can't not celebrate your birthday.

36:43.328 --> 36:44.997
I don't have a babysitter.

36:45.581 --> 36:48.959
Musto. He's got four kids.
They're all still alive.

36:49.334 --> 36:51.628
Yeah, I'm sure he's great and everything,

36:51.712 --> 36:55.799
but you can't just show up here
and expect me to...

36:57.676 --> 36:59.469
I'm not taking

36:59.553 --> 37:03.098
"you just can't show up here
and expect me to"

37:03.182 --> 37:04.308
for an answer.

37:06.476 --> 37:07.519
Get dressed.

37:09.188 --> 37:13.150
Okay, I'll call Lucy,
the girl from downstairs,

37:13.233 --> 37:17.487
and I'll see if she's available,
but it's really, really short notice.

37:17.571 --> 37:19.740
So don't get excited.

37:22.409 --> 37:24.369
-Lucy, hi.
-Hi, Lucy!

37:24.453 --> 37:28.415
Hi. That's my dad. My dad's here.

37:29.249 --> 37:30.292
Yeah.

37:31.335 --> 37:35.547
Are you free by any chance to come over?
I just have this last-minute thing.

37:35.631 --> 37:39.718
I won't be too late.
Yeah. That'd be great.

37:39.801 --> 37:42.846
Thank you so much. Okay.

37:52.439 --> 37:53.440
Thank you.

37:56.235 --> 37:57.277
Hi, Musto.

37:57.361 --> 37:58.362
Hi, Laura.

38:05.911 --> 38:08.288
You look very lovely.

38:08.372 --> 38:09.456
Thank you.

38:10.874 --> 38:12.626
Musto, take us to 21.

38:12.709 --> 38:14.753
-21 it is.
-Thanks.

38:20.717 --> 38:22.344
So, did Dean take his trip?

38:22.845 --> 38:23.846
Yeah.

38:24.805 --> 38:26.431
Did he get you a nice present?

38:27.266 --> 38:28.475
He did, actually.

38:29.560 --> 38:30.561
Jewelry?

38:31.645 --> 38:36.275
No. He got me a nice present.
When are you gonna drop it about Dean?

38:37.609 --> 38:39.027
No little red box?

38:40.237 --> 38:41.655
What are you implying?

38:45.075 --> 38:49.663
I had him followed. Do you know
where he came from the other night?

38:49.746 --> 38:51.957
What? No, where?

38:53.250 --> 38:54.668
52nd and 5th.

38:55.210 --> 38:56.211
So?

38:57.337 --> 38:58.547
It's Cartier.

39:01.800 --> 39:03.760
You didn't get any present from there?

39:03.844 --> 39:04.845
No.

39:04.928 --> 39:06.430
At least we know he has taste.

39:07.472 --> 39:10.184
Now, what was he doing there?
Did you ever check his phone?

39:10.267 --> 39:13.187
Yes. There weren't any texts.

39:13.270 --> 39:15.439
Well, that's really suspicious.

39:15.522 --> 39:19.610
If you're working with someone,
you're in close contact. Unless...

39:21.528 --> 39:22.696
he erased 'em.

39:23.280 --> 39:24.698
That bastard.

39:25.365 --> 39:27.784
When did this acting strange start?

39:29.578 --> 39:32.581
He's just been distracted

39:32.664 --> 39:36.543
since he... started this company

39:36.627 --> 39:40.130
and started working with Fiona.

39:40.839 --> 39:42.674
Is Fiona Miss Toiletries?

39:44.343 --> 39:46.762
The tall business associate, yeah.

39:48.013 --> 39:51.850
I mean, how he could do this to you...
I could strangle him.

39:53.060 --> 39:55.646
Here's the Plaza.
This is the place to have an affair.

39:55.729 --> 39:57.022
It has the most exits.

39:57.105 --> 39:58.899
Exits on three streets.

39:58.982 --> 40:00.984
Can any man be monogamous?

40:01.693 --> 40:05.531
Monogamy and marriage
are based on the concept of property.

40:05.614 --> 40:08.283
I've been married for 20 years.

40:08.367 --> 40:09.409
See?

40:10.410 --> 40:14.248
Women, you can't live with 'em,
you can't live without 'em.

40:15.082 --> 40:17.209
That doesn't mean
you have to live with 'em.

40:19.628 --> 40:22.798
Bogart's table.
Where he proposed to Bacall.

40:23.257 --> 40:24.258
Really?

40:25.467 --> 40:27.678
Happy birthday, kiddo.

40:28.679 --> 40:29.680
Thank you.

40:37.521 --> 40:38.981
Your watch.

40:39.064 --> 40:40.524
I love this.

40:40.607 --> 40:44.278
You used to like to wear that. I think
it might fit you a little better now.

40:44.653 --> 40:46.488
I've always loved this watch.

40:47.489 --> 40:50.993
I bought that for myself
after my first big sale.

40:51.076 --> 40:52.327
A de Kooning woman.

40:52.953 --> 40:54.580
I love it. Thank you.

40:56.206 --> 41:00.210
I remember the first moment, the moment,

41:00.836 --> 41:04.256
when I first recognized you as a person.

41:05.007 --> 41:06.300
We were in the country.

41:06.383 --> 41:12.014
You were about nine months old,
and you were sitting on the ground,

41:12.097 --> 41:17.311
and I picked you up, and your diaper
was sopping wet with mud and water, and...

41:17.394 --> 41:21.273
we looked at each other
and just started laughing. And...

41:22.941 --> 41:25.277
there you were. I saw who you were.

41:28.071 --> 41:29.281
And here we are.

41:32.784 --> 41:35.704
What next? I think we should follow him.

41:35.787 --> 41:37.164
-What?
-Yeah.

41:37.247 --> 41:39.875
I think we should keep an eye on him.
See what he's up to.

41:39.958 --> 41:41.543
No, I can't do that.

41:41.627 --> 41:43.670
I think you better see him in action.

41:45.422 --> 41:49.218
Well, they have a work dinner on Friday.

41:49.301 --> 41:50.302
Great.

41:51.178 --> 41:53.805
I'll change car. We'll tail him.

41:54.223 --> 41:57.142
Can you just act
a little less excited about this?

41:57.226 --> 41:59.978
Because this is my life,
and it might be falling apart.

42:00.896 --> 42:04.775
We gotta get you out of this limbo.
We gotta ease your troubled mind.

42:06.193 --> 42:07.361
Hey, Greg.

42:08.403 --> 42:11.281
Could we bring the little girl
a belly buster, please?

42:12.449 --> 42:17.454
I'm not worried about you, kiddo.
You've got brains, beauty and character,

42:17.538 --> 42:20.165
which is the most important thing
a person can have.

42:20.999 --> 42:24.878
Do you know a woman is at her most
beautiful between the ages of 35 and 39?

42:25.712 --> 42:29.758
Great, so I have many months left.

42:29.842 --> 42:33.679
Women are like flowers.
They're all beautiful at any age.

42:34.304 --> 42:37.099
Even dried flowers. You know...

42:37.182 --> 42:39.434
I don't know why women
get plastic surgery.

42:39.518 --> 42:41.186
Because of men like you.

42:42.020 --> 42:43.814
I prefer the factory original.

42:44.982 --> 42:47.693
Yeah, and every other make and model.

42:49.278 --> 42:51.530
Thank you.
I'm gonna take that as a compliment.

42:52.072 --> 42:53.323
Are there two?

42:54.533 --> 42:55.617
Scared me.

42:58.287 --> 43:01.915
You know, I think everyone has a right
to their own privacy.

43:03.458 --> 43:06.420
But if he's doing something dishonorable,
you need to know

43:06.503 --> 43:09.923
and find out on your own terms,
so you can be prepared for anything.

43:10.007 --> 43:12.050
I don't think there's anything at all.
It may not be anything.

43:12.134 --> 43:14.303
We'll find out on Friday.
I'll pick you up, and we'll have some fun.

43:14.386 --> 43:15.387
No.

43:19.016 --> 43:21.393
And that way I'm, like,
I'm gonna take the risk.

43:21.476 --> 43:23.061
I'm gonna introduce him to Milo.

43:23.729 --> 43:25.939
-Yeah.
-It's, like, people to people meeting.

43:26.023 --> 43:28.942
Like, why does it have to be, like,
this guy that I'm sleeping with...

43:29.026 --> 43:30.027
-meets my son.
-Daddy!

43:30.110 --> 43:31.987
-Hey! Come here.
-You know what I mean?

43:32.070 --> 43:33.572
-Mom.
-I'm so sorry.

43:33.655 --> 43:34.698
-Is that crazy?
-I'm so sorry.

43:34.781 --> 43:35.782
-Mom!
-Hi!

43:35.866 --> 43:36.867
Hi, Dad!

43:36.950 --> 43:38.160
-How's my big girl?
-Daddy!

43:38.243 --> 43:41.330
-Hey, muffin! How's my baby?
-Hey.

43:41.413 --> 43:43.582
Hi, baby. How you doing?

43:43.665 --> 43:45.792
-Good.
-How's the birthday girl? How was the day?

43:45.876 --> 43:47.044
-You know.
-Yeah?

43:47.127 --> 43:51.006
-My dad. Lots of theories and stories.
-Okay.

43:53.050 --> 43:56.553
So, what do you say we go around
the corner and we can celebrate properly?

43:56.637 --> 43:57.763
Yeah, that sounds nice.

43:57.846 --> 43:59.014
-Okay, good.
-I'll call a sitter.

43:59.097 --> 44:00.098
All right.

44:00.182 --> 44:01.475
How was your trip?

44:03.101 --> 44:04.520
-How was your trip?
-The trip?

44:04.603 --> 44:06.104
-Yeah.
-Great. Very productive.

44:06.188 --> 44:08.106
-Yeah?
-Yep. Found an office,

44:08.190 --> 44:11.818
had some great meetings.
We found this really fun karaoke bar.

44:13.028 --> 44:14.446
We had so much fun.

44:17.783 --> 44:18.825
Yeah, it's really cool.

44:18.909 --> 44:20.744
They have these 3D-printed homes

44:20.827 --> 44:23.080
that they can put up for, like,
a few thousand dollars,

44:23.163 --> 44:24.831
and they can do it in, like, a day.

44:24.915 --> 44:27.459
It's really great.
Like, if there's a disaster or something,

44:27.543 --> 44:29.628
you can just rebuild an entire community.

44:29.711 --> 44:31.505
Wow. That's really cool.

44:31.588 --> 44:33.590
-Technology, man. It's crazy.
-Yeah.

44:36.510 --> 44:37.511
How's the thing?

44:37.594 --> 44:38.679
Writing?

44:42.015 --> 44:45.227
Yeah, I don't know.
I'm so used to writing at night.

44:45.310 --> 44:50.691
So, sitting at my desk during the day,
it just feels, like, creatively stifling.

44:51.692 --> 44:52.860
You just have to start.

44:53.944 --> 44:54.945
Yeah.

44:58.156 --> 45:00.617
Sorry,
I just gotta handle this thing for work.

45:00.701 --> 45:02.703
Make sure this text went through.

45:02.786 --> 45:05.998
We just landed another account.
It's crazy.

45:09.126 --> 45:14.006
You know, I'm just wondering, should we
enroll Theo in preschool this year?

45:14.089 --> 45:17.134
Because, you know, she's on the cusp,
and I don't wanna wait too long,

45:17.217 --> 45:18.635
and the deadline's soon.

45:18.719 --> 45:19.887
What do you think?

45:21.138 --> 45:22.973
Whatever. I mean, I trust you.

45:28.353 --> 45:29.688
Do you wanna go? It's loud.

45:29.771 --> 45:31.315
Yeah. Yeah.

45:32.482 --> 45:33.483
Excuse me.

45:33.984 --> 45:35.319
Yeah, let's get outta here.

45:39.198 --> 45:40.199
The wine was good.

45:40.282 --> 45:41.283
Yeah?

45:41.867 --> 45:43.076
Dinner was good.

45:57.257 --> 45:59.051
-I'm sorry. Did you want a cake?
-No.

45:59.134 --> 46:01.178
I thought you hate
when they do that in restaurants.

46:01.261 --> 46:03.055
-No, it's fine. It's fine.
-So I'm just--

46:03.138 --> 46:05.349
I didn't wanna embarrass you,
so I didn't get it.

46:05.432 --> 46:06.433
No. It's fine.

46:06.517 --> 46:08.101
-If you want cake, it's really simple.
-I don't.

46:08.185 --> 46:11.104
-I'm gonna get you a cake. Excuse me!
-No, Dean. I don't want one.

46:56.984 --> 47:00.070
Okay, you have to go to sleep.
Okay? Good night.

47:00.445 --> 47:02.114
-I love you.
-Good night. I love you.

47:02.197 --> 47:03.949
-Please go to sleep.
-Okay.

47:04.032 --> 47:08.328
Yes? Yes? You go to sleep. Go to sleep.

47:08.412 --> 47:09.621
-Okay.
-Love you.

47:12.749 --> 47:14.293
-Thank you so much.
-You're welcome.

47:14.376 --> 47:15.794
I'll just be a few hours.

47:15.878 --> 47:18.630
-Okay. Okay, sounds good.
-It's just a dinner thing. Okay.

47:18.714 --> 47:20.215
Thank you so much. Thanks.

47:25.053 --> 47:27.472
This is your idea of incognito?

47:27.848 --> 47:29.474
They'll never see us coming.

47:30.851 --> 47:32.102
We have supplies too.

47:33.478 --> 47:34.563
Hop in, cutie.

47:36.648 --> 47:38.609
Let's make a night of it.

47:52.206 --> 47:54.166
-Where are we going?
-Soho House.

47:54.249 --> 47:57.085
-Why is he at Soho House?
-I don't know.

47:57.169 --> 48:00.464
So many great clubs in New York,
architecturally.

48:00.547 --> 48:05.302
Knickerbocker. The readings alone
at the Knickerbocker, please.

48:29.326 --> 48:30.619
Okay, we beat 'em.

49:06.154 --> 49:08.323
My guy at Claridge's got back to me.

49:09.616 --> 49:15.414
He said that Dean went to J.Sheekey's,
where he had reserved a four-top...

49:16.957 --> 49:18.375
which is a good cover.

49:19.585 --> 49:21.795
Or maybe they just went with clients.

49:23.005 --> 49:24.256
That's a possibility too.

49:24.339 --> 49:25.299
I think there's a reservation.

49:25.382 --> 49:26.800
There they are.

49:30.429 --> 49:32.055
Is it the one with all the legs?

49:33.515 --> 49:35.434
No, I can see them from here.

49:35.517 --> 49:36.435
There you go.

49:36.518 --> 49:39.813
-Thanks. Chivalry is not dead.
-Yeah, that's Fiona.

49:40.272 --> 49:42.774
Did I ever tell you about
the Rockette that I dated?

49:43.984 --> 49:45.110
Yeah.

49:58.665 --> 49:59.833
You know...

50:02.753 --> 50:06.757
the Russians fed the cosmonauts beluga.

50:07.925 --> 50:09.134
High protein.

50:10.385 --> 50:15.390
Their waste was nothing but a...
slight touch of ash.

50:16.308 --> 50:17.351
Really?

50:18.810 --> 50:22.981
We can call this caviar because...
there's no more beluga.

50:23.065 --> 50:25.984
But this is American-made,
and it's pretty good.

50:28.612 --> 50:31.323
Can a man ever be satisfied
with one woman?

50:31.406 --> 50:32.407
Come on.

50:32.908 --> 50:34.201
That's hardwiring.

50:34.284 --> 50:36.870
Keeping the species alive.

50:36.954 --> 50:40.165
I mean, the woman
passes through an emotional filter.

50:40.958 --> 50:43.210
Man doesn't pass through
the emotional part.

50:43.293 --> 50:47.381
It goes directly from the eyes to the ass.

50:49.633 --> 50:51.134
And it's just that simple?

50:53.762 --> 50:54.930
Okay, hardwire,

50:55.013 --> 50:59.852
so then how does a woman
keep her desirability to a man?

51:02.604 --> 51:04.439
A woman that knows that she is.

51:05.566 --> 51:11.655
A woman that is confident
in her effect on you, that's sexy.

51:14.575 --> 51:19.580
The Corsican...
wanted me to pull her hair... hard.

51:20.372 --> 51:23.041
And that just wasn't me.

51:23.834 --> 51:24.835
The Corsican?

51:26.086 --> 51:27.796
My God. It's Dean.

51:28.338 --> 51:30.257
-Okay. Just--
-What do I do? What do I do?

51:30.340 --> 51:33.552
Take it, but be cool. Breathe.

51:33.635 --> 51:34.761
Hey.

51:35.804 --> 51:36.638
Cool.

51:36.722 --> 51:40.934
No, everything's-- everything's fine.
I'm just about to go to sleep.

51:44.730 --> 51:46.648
Yeah. No, that's fine.

51:47.983 --> 51:49.943
After midnight? Yeah, no problem.

51:50.027 --> 51:51.028
Okay.

51:53.947 --> 51:55.949
That was pretty good for your first time.

51:57.534 --> 52:00.746
Code red.
He's cutting her out of the herd.

52:01.538 --> 52:02.998
"Oh, golly goodness,

52:03.081 --> 52:06.293
I don't think my long legs
will fit in that cab with all of them."

52:12.090 --> 52:13.091
Taxi!

52:17.429 --> 52:18.972
-Good team.
-Are you coming?

52:19.056 --> 52:20.641
Okay. Scoot over.

52:21.099 --> 52:22.643
I can't believe this.

52:23.477 --> 52:25.812
All right. Let's get going.

52:25.896 --> 52:27.606
Hang on to those eggs. Here we go.

52:30.817 --> 52:32.361
Oh, my God. What are you doing?

52:32.444 --> 52:34.613
They're trying to lose us.
It's not gonna happen.

52:34.696 --> 52:36.198
We've got too much horsepower!

52:37.366 --> 52:38.867
You're driving crazy!

52:39.576 --> 52:40.953
Screw you, asshole!

52:41.036 --> 52:43.247
-Now, that wasn't nice. Thank you!
-Don't!

52:43.705 --> 52:44.706
Jerk!

52:45.040 --> 52:48.293
-Yeah, Jersey!
-Oh, God. Why are you driving like this?

52:48.377 --> 52:51.004
'Cause they're driving like this is why.
Hang on.

52:51.547 --> 52:52.840
Coming through!

52:54.842 --> 52:57.135
-You're--
-Come on. Not now. Not now.

52:57.928 --> 52:59.513
-Oh, my God.
-Hey. Come on, girl.

52:59.596 --> 53:03.725
Come on. Come on. Come on, darling.
There you go. Careful.

53:04.226 --> 53:06.520
-Brace yourself.
-Jesus. Dad.

53:06.603 --> 53:07.896
Nice. Nice.

53:07.980 --> 53:08.939
Oh, my God.

53:09.022 --> 53:10.357
You are all in my way!

53:10.440 --> 53:11.608
I'm gonna be sick.

53:11.692 --> 53:13.151
Lucky it's a convertible.

53:16.989 --> 53:19.366
Come on. There you go. There you go.

53:21.994 --> 53:23.662
They're turning! Hang on!

53:25.664 --> 53:26.915
Are you trying to kill us?

53:26.999 --> 53:29.168
He ran a red! And so did we!

53:33.005 --> 53:35.632
-Oops. We're gonna meet people.
-Oh, no.

53:35.716 --> 53:37.718
We're gonna make new friends, I'm afraid.

53:37.801 --> 53:38.886
Sir, please pull over.

53:38.969 --> 53:40.179
Nothing to worry about.

53:47.186 --> 53:48.187
There you go.

53:59.281 --> 54:01.116
Your license and registration, please.

54:01.200 --> 54:03.035
And I'm gonna need you
to turn the engine off.

54:03.118 --> 54:04.661
I'm afraid I can't do that.

54:05.078 --> 54:06.413
Sir, turn the engine off.

54:06.496 --> 54:09.333
Listen. Here's the deal.
I'm stuck down here in second.

54:09.416 --> 54:10.584
The starter's overheating.

54:10.667 --> 54:12.377
If I turn it off,
I'm gonna lose it, and that'll be that.

54:12.461 --> 54:13.962
Sir. Turn it off.

54:14.963 --> 54:17.966
Okay. All right. Let's say goodbye to it,
'cause it's not gonna come back.

54:18.050 --> 54:19.051
That's fine.

54:20.177 --> 54:21.178
Hear that?

54:21.762 --> 54:22.971
Sir, is that alcohol?

54:23.055 --> 54:27.809
Hell-- That's '98 Krug in the car,
but it's not open. We've yet to pop it.

54:27.893 --> 54:29.937
Okay. Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you
to step out of the car.

54:30.020 --> 54:31.438
Your lady friend can stay seated.

54:31.522 --> 54:33.357
This is like three times this week.

54:33.440 --> 54:36.068
You're very funny.
I'm charmed that you said that though.

54:36.151 --> 54:37.945
I mean, it's kinda flattering.

54:38.028 --> 54:40.405
But she's not exactly my lady friend.

54:40.489 --> 54:43.659
This is my daughter. Laura.
Who's your guy over here?

54:43.742 --> 54:44.743
That's Chris.

54:44.826 --> 54:47.037
Chris, my daughter Laura. How you doing?

54:47.621 --> 54:50.290
Laura. This is Officer...

54:52.084 --> 54:53.961
Are you Tommy O'Callaghan's kid?

54:55.546 --> 54:56.588
Sir?

54:56.672 --> 54:57.840
Is Tommy your pop?

54:58.549 --> 55:00.300
Tom, yes, that's my dad.

55:01.969 --> 55:04.930
Well, we go way back. I'm gonna call him.

55:05.013 --> 55:06.974
No, no, no.
Sir, please put the phone away.

55:07.516 --> 55:08.851
It's late. It's late.

55:08.934 --> 55:11.728
Yeah, it's late. I don't think my mom
would appreciate a phone call right now.

55:11.812 --> 55:14.398
That's right. She would brain him, not me.

55:14.481 --> 55:15.983
Yeah.

55:16.066 --> 55:18.485
Well, I know your pop. That was a guy.

55:19.027 --> 55:22.865
I went to Sergeant O'Callaghan, Timmy--

55:22.948 --> 55:25.075
I went to his beefsteak
for his retirement,

55:25.158 --> 55:27.786
and I don't know how we got home,
to be honest with you.

55:28.495 --> 55:29.580
That's my grandfather.

55:29.663 --> 55:30.998
That's right. That is correct.

55:31.081 --> 55:32.791
Gosh, I don't know why
I didn't make you right away.

55:32.875 --> 55:35.169
You are a ringer. Dead ringer.

55:35.252 --> 55:37.796
-Thank you.
-The eyes. Oh, my God.

55:39.339 --> 55:41.800
So, you still going upstate?
Going to the Adirondacks, what?

55:41.884 --> 55:43.510
We-- Well, when we can.

55:43.594 --> 55:44.636
Yeah?

55:44.720 --> 55:46.305
And you got kids of your own?

55:46.972 --> 55:49.266
-We're trying. Yeah.
-Attaboy. Attaboy.

55:49.349 --> 55:50.976
It's the trying
that's so much fun, isn't it?

55:51.059 --> 55:52.060
Yeah, isn't it?

55:53.061 --> 55:54.938
Well, it's good to see ya, man.
Really good to see ya.

55:55.022 --> 55:56.523
Nice to meet you, sir.
Good to meet you.

55:56.607 --> 55:58.400
And actually,
we could get you on your way,

55:58.483 --> 56:00.444
if you could be a little more careful
from now on, please.

56:00.527 --> 56:02.613
No, I was being careful,
that's why I ran the light,

56:02.696 --> 56:04.823
'cause I didn't wanna get stuck
in the intersection.

56:04.907 --> 56:05.741
That's all right.

56:05.824 --> 56:07.284
Hey, I need a little manpower.

56:07.367 --> 56:09.745
We need some beef. You only gotta
get it going about ten miles an hour.

56:09.828 --> 56:10.829
Okay.

56:10.913 --> 56:13.081
-It'll pop pretty easily in second.
-We're just gonna give him a push.

56:13.165 --> 56:14.374
I'll just pop it.

56:14.917 --> 56:16.710
-Thanks. Let me get the keys in.
-You in?

56:16.793 --> 56:17.961
Yeah, I'm in. Thanks.

56:19.338 --> 56:21.965
It must be very nice to be you.

56:23.050 --> 56:24.927
I wouldn't have it any other way.

56:25.010 --> 56:27.429
All right. On your mark. Get set. Go.

56:33.268 --> 56:36.146
New York's finest! Thanks, fellas.

57:00.546 --> 57:01.547
Felix?

57:03.423 --> 57:04.591
Hey.

57:07.427 --> 57:09.221
Wow, you look great.

57:09.304 --> 57:10.722
You look better.

57:11.932 --> 57:13.934
Yeah? Well, I'm with my daughter.

57:16.186 --> 57:17.479
Hi.

57:17.563 --> 57:18.564
Hey.

57:20.691 --> 57:23.026
I may be ready to sell the Hockney.

57:23.819 --> 57:25.445
You know how to get to me.

57:26.822 --> 57:28.198
You know where to call me.

57:28.282 --> 57:29.700
I keep funny hours.

57:31.243 --> 57:32.369
I remember.

57:42.296 --> 57:43.422
It's a client.

57:52.222 --> 57:53.807
I think I'm going deaf.

57:55.434 --> 57:56.435
Really?

57:57.561 --> 58:01.940
I can hear everything fine,
except women's voices.

58:03.400 --> 58:05.819
You can't go deaf just to women.

58:07.738 --> 58:08.989
It's the pitch.

58:14.036 --> 58:15.829
We're making some good progress.

58:17.080 --> 58:18.332
This is pathetic.

58:20.042 --> 58:22.169
We just need to get some more information.

58:24.254 --> 58:26.924
Maybe he's just not
interested in me anymore.

58:29.801 --> 58:30.844
Impossible.

58:32.846 --> 58:33.889
Thanks.

58:46.985 --> 58:48.820
You're gonna be all right, shorty.

59:28.861 --> 59:30.737
Turns out he was married.

59:31.196 --> 59:32.281
I'm so sorry.

59:33.407 --> 59:37.995
I know. It's such a strange bummer.

59:39.079 --> 59:43.876
And you know what?
Like, I have things to do.

59:44.585 --> 59:46.795
You know what I mean? I don't really
have time for other people's baggage.

59:46.879 --> 59:48.964
I'm sort of like, "Okay."

59:49.339 --> 59:53.218
Like, get on down the road if that's
sort of what you're gonna be like,

59:53.302 --> 59:55.137
-especially in our community.
-Sure. Sure.

59:55.220 --> 59:56.221
Which I think is like...

59:56.305 --> 59:58.765
Okay, I mean, he's basically
walking around with, like, a mask on,

59:58.849 --> 01:00:01.977
whereas I'm, like, so... open.

01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:06.690
-Yeah.
-I'm just, like, bare. Like, I'm naked.

01:00:07.733 --> 01:00:10.736
And I was--
You know, I was there with him naked.

01:00:10.819 --> 01:00:13.447
You would think two people naked together,
like, one of them might say,

01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:16.325
"By the way, like,
I have a wife and a family,

01:00:16.408 --> 01:00:19.119
and we own a home together, and we,
like, all sleep in the same house

01:00:19.203 --> 01:00:20.954
and use the same bathrooms, and we...

01:00:21.038 --> 01:00:24.458
have a family, and you're not in it
because you're not even my girlfriend.

01:00:24.541 --> 01:00:25.918
Because I have a wife."

01:00:27.544 --> 01:00:29.296
Okay, what's so important?

01:00:32.090 --> 01:00:33.383
Well, it's just a start.

01:00:37.137 --> 01:00:38.889
Oh, my God.

01:00:38.972 --> 01:00:40.140
What...

01:00:40.224 --> 01:00:41.975
-This is nothing.
-Laura.

01:00:42.059 --> 01:00:47.481
My God. What if what we find out is
that Dean's just busy, and I'm in a rut?

01:00:47.564 --> 01:00:48.565
That's it.

01:00:49.233 --> 01:00:51.276
God, I regret telling you anything.

01:00:52.319 --> 01:00:54.071
I talked to my man at Bones.

01:00:54.154 --> 01:00:58.367
Bones--
No, enough with the spy scenarios, okay?

01:00:59.368 --> 01:01:04.540
Did you really call me in here to show me
pictures of my husband eating a sandwich?

01:01:04.623 --> 01:01:07.960
There's more. We put a hotwatch on him.

01:01:10.212 --> 01:01:11.296
What's a hotwatch?

01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:15.133
They track his credit cards
and his whereabouts.

01:01:15.634 --> 01:01:17.052
Okay, and?

01:01:22.516 --> 01:01:24.935
May be nothing, but...

01:01:26.311 --> 01:01:27.354
What?

01:01:32.943 --> 01:01:34.736
He booked a trip to Manzanillo.

01:01:36.238 --> 01:01:38.156
You are so full of it.

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:40.659
He would tell me
if he was going to Mexico.

01:01:42.995 --> 01:01:45.414
We need to gather and evaluate.

01:01:46.456 --> 01:01:47.666
I have to get going.

01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:50.752
Wait, I can drop you. Quick stop.

01:01:51.378 --> 01:01:53.755
-No, I--
-Mrs. Morris at the Sherry. It's her 90th.

01:01:53.839 --> 01:01:55.215
I have to get home.

01:01:55.299 --> 01:01:57.509
Fast elevators, and she's got a Twombly.

01:02:03.599 --> 01:02:05.601
She did the Venice Biennale.

01:02:06.185 --> 01:02:09.396
With Storm King,
she's doing something so beautiful.

01:02:10.022 --> 01:02:15.027
It's beyond description.
It's a crescent. It's called Fallen Sky.

01:02:15.444 --> 01:02:19.031
Made of stainless steel,
and you have the reflection.

01:02:19.114 --> 01:02:22.993
And at Storm King, you know,
all these grotesque big things...

01:02:24.161 --> 01:02:25.829
Are you Felix's daughter?

01:02:26.163 --> 01:02:27.581
Yes, I'm Laura.

01:02:27.998 --> 01:02:29.416
You live in the city?

01:02:29.499 --> 01:02:30.501
I do.

01:02:30.959 --> 01:02:32.294
Are you married?

01:02:33.128 --> 01:02:34.254
Yes, I am.

01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:35.797
How is it?

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:40.135
Honestly, I'm not sure right now.

01:02:40.719 --> 01:02:43.138
And that was very entertaining.

01:02:43.222 --> 01:02:49.228
She makes rocks, huge ones, small ones,
but they're as light as a feather.

01:02:50.896 --> 01:02:54.566
You know what I think?
Marriage is like a bank account.

01:02:55.359 --> 01:02:57.903
You make deposits
for the first 20 or 30 years,

01:02:57.986 --> 01:03:02.366
and then, after that,
you have all this interest built up,

01:03:02.449 --> 01:03:05.202
and you can start making withdrawals.

01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:10.249
And... I don't forget costumes.

01:03:17.256 --> 01:03:18.340
So nice to meet you.

01:03:19.299 --> 01:03:20.384
Same here.

01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:28.225
I'm dying for that Twombly.

01:03:29.768 --> 01:03:32.521
She looks pretty healthy to me.
She might make it to 100.

01:03:33.564 --> 01:03:35.899
All right.
Don't get my blood pressure up, shorty.

01:03:35.983 --> 01:03:37.776
All right,
I wanna show you something special.

01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:40.696
But you have to walk backwards
so no one knows we're leaving.

01:03:52.749 --> 01:03:54.293
Where are we going?

01:03:54.376 --> 01:03:55.669
Hey! Where are we--

01:04:09.433 --> 01:04:10.976
That's something, isn't it?

01:04:11.852 --> 01:04:12.978
Beautiful.

01:04:16.315 --> 01:04:19.109
I remember the first time I saw them
at the Tuileries.

01:04:21.111 --> 01:04:24.656
The next day, your mom and I
drove out to the gardens at Giverny.

01:05:46.154 --> 01:05:47.239
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:50.742
How's writing going?

01:05:52.202 --> 01:05:55.789
I wish I had something exciting to report.

01:05:55.873 --> 01:05:58.834
I just-- I'm so stuck.

01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:01.670
I keep telling you...

01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:04.965
you have to make more time for yourself.

01:06:05.757 --> 01:06:08.927
Yeah, right. Like... take a trip.

01:06:09.011 --> 01:06:10.512
-Yeah.
-By myself.

01:06:12.014 --> 01:06:13.557
I forgot to tell you.

01:06:14.057 --> 01:06:16.226
I got invited to a conference
down in Mexico.

01:06:17.186 --> 01:06:19.646
It's kinda last minute,
but it's a really big deal.

01:06:22.191 --> 01:06:23.442
Who's going?

01:06:24.234 --> 01:06:26.987
Just the team, you know.
Me, John, Fifi, Rog--

01:06:27.070 --> 01:06:28.071
Fiona?

01:06:28.989 --> 01:06:30.282
Yeah. Fifi.

01:06:31.825 --> 01:06:32.826
Right.

01:06:38.415 --> 01:06:41.627
All right. I'm going to bed.

01:06:43.170 --> 01:06:44.171
Love you.

01:06:48.383 --> 01:06:51.929
Your Bones man was right.
They're headed to Mexico.

01:06:52.304 --> 01:06:53.305
I told you.

01:06:53.388 --> 01:06:55.516
All right, pack your bags. Call a sitter.

01:06:55.599 --> 01:06:57.017
I'll arrange everything else.

01:06:57.768 --> 01:07:02.231
Are you crazy? I'm not gonna leave
my kids for a few days with a babysitter.

01:07:02.648 --> 01:07:03.857
Call your mother.

01:07:04.358 --> 01:07:05.984
We're not just gonna hop--

01:07:06.443 --> 01:07:07.444
You know what?

01:07:07.528 --> 01:07:09.780
I'm just gonna talk to him.
I'm just gonna talk to him.

01:07:09.863 --> 01:07:11.323
I don't advise that.

01:07:11.865 --> 01:07:14.409
Look, you need to get ahead of this thing.

01:07:15.244 --> 01:07:16.995
It's only a few hours away.

01:07:17.704 --> 01:07:21.834
My friend's condo,
at the resort next door, is available.

01:07:21.917 --> 01:07:23.585
Got its own private entrance.

01:07:23.669 --> 01:07:25.838
And you deserve a little vacation.

01:07:25.921 --> 01:07:27.256
No way.

01:07:27.339 --> 01:07:28.674
Pack light.

01:07:37.057 --> 01:07:39.184
I got a map of the properties
from my travel agent.

01:07:39.268 --> 01:07:41.103
Who has a travel agent anymore?

01:07:41.186 --> 01:07:43.730
Their group is staying
at this place right over here.

01:07:44.231 --> 01:07:47.150
What do you say
we meet at the bar in, say, 45?

01:08:33.988 --> 01:08:37.117
Mexicali Rose

01:08:37.492 --> 01:08:41.287
Stop crying

01:08:42.162 --> 01:08:45.501
I'll come back to you

01:08:45.584 --> 01:08:49.171
Some sunny day

01:08:50.046 --> 01:08:53.800
You know every night

01:08:53.884 --> 01:08:57.888
That I'll be pining

01:08:58.970 --> 01:09:05.145
Every hour the year that I'm away

01:09:07.397 --> 01:09:11.234
Dry those big brown eyes

01:09:11.818 --> 01:09:15.113
And smile, dear

01:09:16.406 --> 01:09:22.996
Banish all those tears
And please don't sigh

01:09:24.247 --> 01:09:27.626
Kiss me once again

01:09:28.335 --> 01:09:33.048
And hold me

01:09:34.758 --> 01:09:41.723
Mexicali Rose

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:51.524
Goodbye

01:10:01.243 --> 01:10:03.996
-Gabi, Laura. Laura, Gabi.
-Hi.

01:10:04.079 --> 01:10:05.664
-My yoga instructor.
-Hi.

01:10:05.747 --> 01:10:07.124
-Charro.
-Hi.

01:10:07.207 --> 01:10:09.293
-Alejandro. Juan.
-Hi.

01:10:09.835 --> 01:10:10.961
This fella I didn't meet.

01:10:11.044 --> 01:10:14.339
Do you really have to make such
a big entrance everywhere you go?

01:10:14.423 --> 01:10:15.674
That was an exit.

01:10:15.757 --> 01:10:17.634
But if I do go missing,
check the yoga studio.

01:10:17.718 --> 01:10:18.927
Just don't break anything.

01:10:19.011 --> 01:10:20.262
-Hi.
-Hey.

01:10:20.345 --> 01:10:21.346
Carla.

01:10:22.681 --> 01:10:24.391
-Carla. This is her place.
-Welcome.

01:10:24.474 --> 01:10:25.851
It's so nice.

01:10:25.934 --> 01:10:26.935
Enjoy it.

01:10:27.603 --> 01:10:29.855
-And I'll think about the Hockney.
-Thank you.

01:10:30.397 --> 01:10:33.108
Wait. Is that why we're here?
Because you're making a deal?

01:10:33.192 --> 01:10:35.235
No. We're here 'cause we're here.

01:10:35.319 --> 01:10:36.361
She just might be someone

01:10:36.445 --> 01:10:38.989
who could be interested
in a very expensive piece of art.

01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:44.411
I can't believe I'm here.

01:10:45.537 --> 01:10:47.539
It's beautiful. Isn't it?

01:10:48.665 --> 01:10:49.666
It is.

01:10:54.796 --> 01:10:57.716
Do you know there's a cult up in Canada

01:10:58.425 --> 01:11:00.928
where women kidnap innocent men,

01:11:01.428 --> 01:11:04.431
and if they try to escape or resist
in any way,

01:11:05.224 --> 01:11:07.768
the women placate them with sex.

01:11:08.185 --> 01:11:09.728
It sounds like your fantasy.

01:11:10.229 --> 01:11:11.730
It's not unlike the bonobos.

01:11:12.689 --> 01:11:14.816
-You know who they are.
-The monkeys?

01:11:15.442 --> 01:11:19.112
Only mammals
where the females dominate the males.

01:11:21.907 --> 01:11:25.160
Why is it that when a woman has an affair,

01:11:25.244 --> 01:11:28.372
it's so wonderful that she found someone?

01:11:28.455 --> 01:11:32.209
But if a man has an affair,
he's banging his secretary?

01:11:34.336 --> 01:11:35.462
Why did you do it?

01:11:44.471 --> 01:11:48.350
When your mom and I were first together,
she was so amazing.

01:11:48.433 --> 01:11:51.436
I mean, she shone all her light on me.

01:11:52.771 --> 01:11:56.233
But when you guys came along,
all that light went to you two.

01:11:57.401 --> 01:12:00.279
And when someone
looked at me again like that...

01:12:02.573 --> 01:12:04.491
you know, I wanted that glow again.

01:12:05.868 --> 01:12:07.619
You're such a baby.

01:12:10.455 --> 01:12:12.457
We all just want to be loved.

01:12:12.958 --> 01:12:14.251
It's exhausting.

01:12:16.628 --> 01:12:17.629
Why?

01:12:19.006 --> 01:12:21.842
It's exhausting to try to love you enough.

01:12:24.219 --> 01:12:28.432
Your mother had all these things
she wanted to do all of a sudden.

01:12:28.515 --> 01:12:30.517
And all her friends.

01:12:30.601 --> 01:12:31.685
And she had you kids.

01:12:32.352 --> 01:12:35.522
You know, when Holly came along
and was so crazy about me,

01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:37.858
I wasn't used to it.

01:12:37.941 --> 01:12:40.068
So that's all it took?

01:12:40.152 --> 01:12:44.489
That was the appeal? That she just
looked at you with such adoration?

01:12:45.574 --> 01:12:49.536
Yeah, and your mom
didn't wanna travel with me anymore.

01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:52.122
I needed to travel. She wouldn't go.

01:12:52.206 --> 01:12:54.499
She suggested I take Holly.

01:12:54.583 --> 01:12:56.293
Holly had just started at the gallery.

01:12:59.129 --> 01:13:00.964
Did you know that she died this year?

01:13:04.676 --> 01:13:06.428
-No.
-She died.

01:13:08.889 --> 01:13:10.891
I never thought I'd outlive her.

01:13:13.268 --> 01:13:14.478
She was only...

01:13:15.437 --> 01:13:16.438
50.

01:13:17.898 --> 01:13:19.858
I don't really remember her.

01:13:21.652 --> 01:13:22.861
She was funny...

01:13:25.322 --> 01:13:26.615
and very smart...

01:13:29.576 --> 01:13:31.453
and a terrifically talented painter.

01:13:39.294 --> 01:13:40.963
I never got to say goodbye to her.

01:13:42.923 --> 01:13:46.051
After everything you put us through,
what it did to Mom,

01:13:46.969 --> 01:13:49.054
and then you didn't even stay with Holly.

01:13:50.097 --> 01:13:51.431
Was it worth it?

01:13:56.603 --> 01:13:57.771
It was heartbreaking...

01:13:59.815 --> 01:14:00.983
for everyone.

01:14:21.003 --> 01:14:22.171
Do you know where we are?

01:14:22.254 --> 01:14:24.423
All right.
We're gonna cut between these two.

01:14:26.341 --> 01:14:28.468
Come here.
Move it. Move it. Move it.

01:14:28.552 --> 01:14:29.636
Dig, dig.

01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:31.930
-Get down. Get down. Get down.
-Okay, okay! All right!

01:14:32.014 --> 01:14:34.892
No. Too late.
Stand up. Stand up. Stand up.

01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:36.768
-Put your arms around me.
-What?

01:14:38.437 --> 01:14:39.438
Gross.

01:14:40.981 --> 01:14:44.067
Yuck. That is truly a new low.

01:14:44.943 --> 01:14:47.321
Hey, you're welcome. It was effective.

01:14:48.030 --> 01:14:49.072
This is wartime.

01:14:49.406 --> 01:14:50.449
Where are we going?

01:14:51.450 --> 01:14:54.286
Mr. Wonderful's room is right over there.

01:14:54.369 --> 01:14:55.370
You sure?

01:14:55.454 --> 01:14:58.165
If you can hold
some of this... here.

01:14:59.208 --> 01:15:00.667
Can hold these.

01:15:02.169 --> 01:15:03.420
Don't crush those.

01:15:08.592 --> 01:15:10.093
-You okay?
-Yeah. Yeah.

01:15:10.177 --> 01:15:12.012
Can you hold these, please?

01:15:12.095 --> 01:15:13.096
Yeah.

01:15:18.477 --> 01:15:19.478
Where now?

01:15:22.689 --> 01:15:23.815
Are you okay?

01:15:23.899 --> 01:15:25.400
I'm doing great. I'm on fire.

01:15:25.484 --> 01:15:26.485
Let's go.

01:15:29.988 --> 01:15:33.367
I never got the point of infinity pools.

01:15:33.450 --> 01:15:35.619
Where the hell is the edge?
You don't even know.

01:15:35.702 --> 01:15:37.746
The damn thing makes me afraid

01:15:37.829 --> 01:15:40.666
that I'm gonna fall off
into some canyon or something.

01:15:41.124 --> 01:15:42.209
Just--

01:15:42.292 --> 01:15:44.962
-Wait a second.
-What? What do you see?

01:15:46.004 --> 01:15:47.381
There's a woman in the room.

01:15:48.841 --> 01:15:50.759
What? You sure?

01:15:52.469 --> 01:15:53.470
I'm sure.

01:15:59.643 --> 01:16:02.020
-Hey. Where you going?
-I can't believe this.

01:16:02.104 --> 01:16:03.355
Wait. Wait!

01:16:03.438 --> 01:16:05.148
I'm ending this shit right now.

01:16:05.232 --> 01:16:06.441
Wait. Don't do that.

01:16:06.525 --> 01:16:07.818
-Where is he?
-Wait up.

01:16:08.527 --> 01:16:09.570
Wait up. Wait up.

01:16:11.822 --> 01:16:13.991
Just a second. This is a bad idea.

01:16:14.074 --> 01:16:15.659
This is your bad idea.

01:16:16.827 --> 01:16:18.412
And that's bad too. Silence that.

01:16:18.495 --> 01:16:20.163
-You silence it. It's not mine.
-Shut it up.

01:16:20.247 --> 01:16:22.165
-It's not mine. It's not my ring.
-It's not--

01:16:22.249 --> 01:16:26.128
It's my ring, but you-- you have my phone.
Where's my phone? Where is it?

01:16:26.211 --> 01:16:28.005
-Grabbing isn't helping.
-Where is it?

01:16:29.298 --> 01:16:30.632
Where's my phone?

01:16:35.095 --> 01:16:37.222
Give it to me. Come on! Give it--

01:16:38.223 --> 01:16:39.725
-No, Dad.
-It's for you.

01:16:39.808 --> 01:16:41.852
It's for you. I wanna talk to this guy.

01:16:44.855 --> 01:16:45.856
Laura?

01:16:46.982 --> 01:16:49.067
Oh, my God! What--

01:16:50.068 --> 01:16:51.862
Fiona? What--

01:16:54.990 --> 01:16:56.241
Do you need to get that?

01:16:58.327 --> 01:16:59.995
One... second.

01:17:00.078 --> 01:17:01.788
-Hey.
-Hey. What's up?

01:17:02.581 --> 01:17:04.750
How you doing, baby? Guess what?

01:17:06.210 --> 01:17:07.711
I'm coming home.

01:17:07.794 --> 01:17:09.880
I got done early,
so I caught a flight home.

01:17:09.963 --> 01:17:11.882
-I'm on my way.
-What? When?

01:17:12.299 --> 01:17:13.926
I should be there in a half hour.

01:17:14.259 --> 01:17:16.762
So, you wanna order some Chinese?

01:17:17.304 --> 01:17:19.056
Maybe crack a bottle of wine?

01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:22.601
Well, I'm not home. My mom is with them.

01:17:23.227 --> 01:17:24.353
So...

01:17:24.436 --> 01:17:25.437
Where are you?

01:17:26.355 --> 01:17:28.148
Well, I can't wait to see you.

01:17:28.232 --> 01:17:30.192
-I love you. See you soon.
-I'll call you later.

01:17:30.275 --> 01:17:32.069
Were you trying to surprise Dean?

01:17:32.486 --> 01:17:33.487
Sort of, yeah.

01:17:33.570 --> 01:17:35.572
That's so romantic.

01:17:37.950 --> 01:17:40.035
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:17:41.245 --> 01:17:42.246
Oh, gosh.

01:17:44.039 --> 01:17:45.457
Is he with you?

01:17:49.586 --> 01:17:51.672
Yes. That's my dad.

01:17:52.256 --> 01:17:53.465
Come say hi, Dad.

01:17:53.549 --> 01:17:54.591
Hi.

01:17:55.050 --> 01:17:56.051
Felix Keane.

01:17:56.134 --> 01:17:58.554
Fiona Saunders. Nice to meet you.

01:17:58.971 --> 01:18:00.138
And this is my friend Mandy.

01:18:00.889 --> 01:18:02.057
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:04.852
So, Dean gave us his room.

01:18:04.935 --> 01:18:07.187
It's so nice, the ocean view, and just...

01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:09.398
Do you wanna come in and have a drink?

01:18:09.481 --> 01:18:11.483
-One drink.
-That's very nice, but no. No.

01:18:11.567 --> 01:18:13.068
We're-- Thank you.

01:18:13.151 --> 01:18:14.695
Thank you. No, we're gonna go.

01:18:14.778 --> 01:18:16.113
-Okay.
-Good to see you.

01:18:16.905 --> 01:18:17.948
Bye.

01:18:40.929 --> 01:18:42.806
You can slow down. There's a storm coming.

01:18:42.890 --> 01:18:45.267
I know. I just gotta get outta here.

01:18:45.809 --> 01:18:47.227
How could you bring me here?

01:18:48.395 --> 01:18:49.980
Hey. I'm on your side.

01:18:50.063 --> 01:18:54.067
I was such an idiot to let you
convince me to come here.

01:18:54.943 --> 01:18:58.238
You blew your own marriage,
and now you're gonna mess up mine?

01:18:58.322 --> 01:19:00.032
Can you let anybody be happy?

01:19:00.616 --> 01:19:02.743
You are so selfish.

01:19:05.746 --> 01:19:07.497
You can say it to my face now.

01:19:08.207 --> 01:19:09.333
I will.

01:19:10.626 --> 01:19:15.214
I am sick of you taking over everything,

01:19:15.881 --> 01:19:18.842
making it all about you
and what you want all the time.

01:19:20.177 --> 01:19:21.929
What you dragged us all through.

01:19:22.012 --> 01:19:23.597
You pushed Mom away.

01:19:25.390 --> 01:19:29.228
You can't go deaf to women's voices.
You know that, right?

01:19:30.562 --> 01:19:32.439
You have daughters and granddaughters,

01:19:32.523 --> 01:19:34.942
so you better start figuring out
how to hear them.

01:19:36.109 --> 01:19:37.236
You pushed Mom away.

01:19:38.362 --> 01:19:39.821
You wanna push us away too?

01:19:40.948 --> 01:19:43.200
It's shocking that as your daughter,

01:19:43.283 --> 01:19:47.120
I'm capable of having
any kind of relationship at all

01:19:47.204 --> 01:19:49.456
with anybody, with anyone respectful.

01:19:50.582 --> 01:19:52.084
You weren't even discreet.

01:19:53.001 --> 01:19:56.880
You couldn't even just be discreet
out of respect for Mom?

01:19:57.923 --> 01:19:58.924
And me?

01:19:59.758 --> 01:20:04.221
Do you know what it's like
to have to keep all of your secrets?

01:20:06.890 --> 01:20:08.141
Stupid theories.

01:20:08.851 --> 01:20:11.728
You are not an animal
with no self-control.

01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:14.648
You can control your own behavior.

01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:20.988
And can you be around a woman
without hitting on her?

01:20:22.197 --> 01:20:24.074
Because it's starting to get pathetic.

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:28.579
What happened to you?

01:20:30.122 --> 01:20:31.456
You used to be fun.

01:20:43.802 --> 01:20:47.139
Maybe something changed.
Can you please check? Any flight.

01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:49.141
Tomorrow morning?

01:20:50.475 --> 01:20:51.476
Please.

01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:54.021
I'm sorry, ma'am.
Those flights have been canceled.

01:20:54.104 --> 01:20:55.731
You can try going on standby.

01:22:02.256 --> 01:22:06.134
Ladies and gentlemen,
please check updated flight information

01:22:06.218 --> 01:22:08.971
because there are
multiple delays and cancellations.

01:22:09.054 --> 01:22:10.222
Thank you.

01:22:24.778 --> 01:22:25.863
Hi.

01:22:25.946 --> 01:22:27.072
-Mommy!
-Mama!

01:22:27.573 --> 01:22:28.740
Hi!

01:22:29.533 --> 01:22:30.826
-You made it.
-Thanks, Mom.

01:22:34.079 --> 01:22:36.164
Come on, girls. No, no. Let's go to bed.

01:22:36.248 --> 01:22:37.875
I don't wanna go to bed.

01:22:47.301 --> 01:22:48.844
Can we talk outside?

01:23:09.948 --> 01:23:10.949
All right.

01:23:11.575 --> 01:23:13.994
What are you thinking? What was that?

01:23:15.329 --> 01:23:16.330
My dad...

01:23:17.539 --> 01:23:19.791
You know, one of his crazy ideas.

01:23:21.001 --> 01:23:24.129
He thought it was a good idea
to follow you to Mexico...

01:23:25.589 --> 01:23:29.843
and if something was going on,
I could get ahead of it.

01:23:29.927 --> 01:23:32.679
-Why didn't you just ask me?
-I don't-- I don't know.

01:23:32.763 --> 01:23:35.224
I know I should have. I should have.

01:23:36.266 --> 01:23:37.476
-Yeah.
-I'm sorry.

01:23:38.810 --> 01:23:39.853
I just...

01:23:42.731 --> 01:23:45.526
I'm just not myself right now, and...

01:23:47.027 --> 01:23:48.529
I can't write,

01:23:49.154 --> 01:23:52.491
and I just feel like
you're not that into me.

01:23:52.574 --> 01:23:55.577
-Babe--
-And I... feel so boring.

01:23:56.036 --> 01:23:58.372
Hey. You are not boring.

01:24:01.250 --> 01:24:03.752
Okay. Maybe a little bit.

01:24:07.297 --> 01:24:09.174
I don't wanna be with anybody else.

01:24:09.258 --> 01:24:12.553
But it seems like you were
everywhere else except with me.

01:24:12.636 --> 01:24:13.637
I was working.

01:24:16.515 --> 01:24:18.892
All right. You know what? I'm sorry.

01:24:20.394 --> 01:24:23.313
I'm sorry. I'm sorry if I did anything
to make you feel that way.

01:24:23.397 --> 01:24:25.524
And I'm sorry I haven't been around more.

01:24:26.733 --> 01:24:28.694
I'm just trying to
make this company successful.

01:24:28.777 --> 01:24:30.028
I'm trying to impress you.

01:24:30.112 --> 01:24:31.738
-Impress me?
-I just--

01:24:31.822 --> 01:24:33.490
You don't have to impress me.

01:24:34.825 --> 01:24:36.368
I just wanna be enough for you.

01:24:38.245 --> 01:24:39.413
You do?

01:24:39.496 --> 01:24:41.748
-Enough for them.
-You are.

01:24:42.332 --> 01:24:43.250
I'm so--

01:24:44.334 --> 01:24:45.878
I'm so sorry.

01:24:47.504 --> 01:24:48.630
I'm sorry.

01:24:51.550 --> 01:24:54.511
I'm so stupid. It was stupid.

01:24:54.595 --> 01:24:55.596
Stupid as hell.

01:24:58.265 --> 01:24:59.850
-I love you.
-I love you.

01:25:00.684 --> 01:25:01.685
So much.

01:25:04.730 --> 01:25:05.731
Let's go home.

01:25:09.359 --> 01:25:11.778
I can't believe you went
all the way to Mexico.

01:25:11.862 --> 01:25:13.530
Trust me, it was not a vacation.

01:25:13.614 --> 01:25:15.032
You're such a stalker.

01:25:55.239 --> 01:25:57.157
Do you want some pancakes?

01:25:57.241 --> 01:25:58.242
No.

01:25:59.576 --> 01:26:00.577
Let me sleep.

01:26:18.303 --> 01:26:19.304
You got it.

01:26:21.056 --> 01:26:23.934
Very nice. You're great.

01:26:25.561 --> 01:26:28.230
Well, we got to the bottom of things.

01:26:30.774 --> 01:26:33.277
And I may have made a few mistakes.

01:26:34.319 --> 01:26:39.283
Next time just ask me
if you wanna spend some time together.

01:26:40.367 --> 01:26:42.369
Okay, I do. How about this?

01:26:42.452 --> 01:26:47.249
The QE2 leaves at 5:00.
You could still make it.

01:26:47.332 --> 01:26:49.084
I have the Princess Margaret suite.

01:26:49.168 --> 01:26:52.296
A little bit floral, but very nice.

01:26:52.379 --> 01:26:54.339
All-you-can-eat, all-you-can-drink,

01:26:54.423 --> 01:26:58.552
and it's a known fact that you can drink
a lot more on a ship in the open ocean.

01:26:58.635 --> 01:27:00.345
We could just get aboard,

01:27:00.429 --> 01:27:03.098
see how much we could handle
without falling overboard.

01:27:04.892 --> 01:27:07.811
Sounds fun, but I can't.

01:27:10.439 --> 01:27:12.191
You have your own adventure.

01:27:19.031 --> 01:27:20.282
I'll see you soon, kiddo.

01:27:32.544 --> 01:27:33.629
Bye, Dad.

01:27:37.049 --> 01:27:38.175
Bye.

01:27:54.733 --> 01:27:58.862
So, how's the writing going?
How many pages you do today?

01:27:58.946 --> 01:28:00.781
I am on page 64.

01:28:01.198 --> 01:28:02.366
Nice.

01:28:02.783 --> 01:28:04.868
I just don't really know where to go next.

01:28:06.119 --> 01:28:07.538
You'll get through it.

01:28:07.621 --> 01:28:10.499
At least we know you could write
a really good detective story.

01:28:12.543 --> 01:28:13.794
Or not so good.

01:28:15.629 --> 01:28:17.089
I can't believe you.

01:28:18.924 --> 01:28:19.925
Here.

01:28:22.302 --> 01:28:23.762
I got you a little something.

01:28:24.263 --> 01:28:26.181
It's the rest of your birthday present.

01:28:30.936 --> 01:28:31.937
Hope you like it.

01:29:05.429 --> 01:29:08.265
Sorry, I didn't realize
how long it takes to engrave.

01:29:26.617 --> 01:29:27.743
It's beautiful.

01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:29.411
Like you.

01:29:40.005 --> 01:29:41.507
It looks really nice on your wrist.

01:29:52.559 --> 01:29:53.810
Looks great.

01:29:53.894 --> 01:29:54.853
Love it.

01:29:55.938 --> 01:29:56.939
Thank you.

01:29:58.190 --> 01:29:59.650
Happy birthday, my love.

01:29:59.733 --> 01:30:01.026
Thank you.
