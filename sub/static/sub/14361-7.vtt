<i>(Frankie)</i>
<i>Out here in the Middle,</i>

00:04.958 --> 00:06.043
<i>if you're a sports star,</i>

00:06.180 --> 00:07.567
<i>the world is your oyster.</i>

00:07.721 --> 00:09.800
<i>Unless your sister</i>
<i>runs over your foot,</i>

00:09.993 --> 00:12.857
<i>and then you'd better</i>
<i>have something to fall back on.</i>

00:13.149 --> 00:15.113
<i>For Axl, it was the couch.</i>

00:15.213 --> 00:16.318
(TV playing indistinctly)
This is not fair!

00:16.434 --> 00:18.312
Not awesome things are not
supposed to happen to me.

00:18.405 --> 00:20.554
Not awesome things are supposed
to happen to other people.

00:20.673 --> 00:22.400
Can I get you
a sandwich or something?

00:22.520 --> 00:24.231
It hurts my foot
to eat sandwiches.

00:24.371 --> 00:25.488
I just want to be left alone.

00:25.671 --> 00:27.024
Stupid Sue.

00:27.114 --> 00:28.373
<i>Axl had pretty much</i>
<i>forgiven Sue</i>

00:28.483 --> 00:29.569
<i>for breaking his foot.</i>

00:29.686 --> 00:31.513
<i>But now and then,</i>
<i>his anger bubbled up.</i>

00:31.639 --> 00:32.965
(Thud)

00:33.996 --> 00:34.977
(Clang) Aah!

00:35.963 --> 00:37.798
(Shower running)

00:38.777 --> 00:39.512
(Door creaks)

00:39.869 --> 00:41.247
I didn't even think
my bones could break,

00:41.369 --> 00:42.447
they're so strong and thick.

00:42.559 --> 00:44.991
God! I drink so much milk!
I'm suing milk!

00:45.121 --> 00:47.080
You know, as long as
you're lying there anyway,

00:47.195 --> 00:48.597
maybe you could do
a little homework?

00:48.824 --> 00:50.674
Oh, my God. You are
the worst comforter ever.

00:50.872 --> 00:52.419
<i>(Sports game playing on TV)</i>

00:55.455 --> 00:57.608
Wait. What is this?

00:57.902 --> 00:59.715
Why are you both sitting down and
looking at me? (Turns off TV)

00:59.832 --> 01:01.078
Well, your mom
and I were talking,

01:01.201 --> 01:03.376
and in light
of your current foot situation,

01:03.572 --> 01:06.576
it might not be a bad idea to
stay on top of the grades thing.

01:06.691 --> 01:07.478
What?

01:07.631 --> 01:09.196
Southern's already revoked
their scholarship offer, Axl,

01:09.307 --> 01:10.993
and East Indy's
being pretty quiet.

01:11.120 --> 01:12.555
I'm just saying
we don't exactly know

01:12.699 --> 01:13.830
where they're at anymore,

01:13.960 --> 01:15.610
and we still gotta think
about getting you into college.

01:15.729 --> 01:17.447
Oh, my God. I'm healing.

01:17.574 --> 01:20.502
Look, we're just saying,
if the scholarship situation

01:20.623 --> 01:22.182
is not the lock
we thought it was gonna be,

01:22.309 --> 01:25.945
we might have to examine
the possibility of a plan B.

01:26.233 --> 01:28.354
So... what would that be?

01:28.529 --> 01:30.972
Well,
that you'd get into college

01:31.098 --> 01:32.667
on your own academic merit.

01:32.835 --> 01:33.735
(Scoffs) That's your plan B?

01:33.882 --> 01:35.938
That's all you got?!
I wanna hear another plan B!

01:36.069 --> 01:38.517
I wanna hear the plan B that
involves <i>you</i> doing something!

01:38.635 --> 01:40.692
Hey. We did do something.
We checked into it,

01:40.810 --> 01:42.728
and the school has tutors
that can help you.

01:42.846 --> 01:43.974
And now that you won't
have practice,

01:44.086 --> 01:45.900
you can use that time to study
and get your grades up.

01:46.017 --> 01:47.259
Let me get this straight--

01:47.434 --> 01:49.192
you have no faith
in my bone mending powers,

01:49.305 --> 01:50.765
I might not be getting
a free ride to college,

01:50.892 --> 01:52.450
and instead of sailing
through my senior year

01:52.547 --> 01:54.422
doing nothing but partying
and ruling the school

01:54.536 --> 01:55.999
as is my God-given right...

01:56.165 --> 01:58.568
you're saying
I have to study more?!

01:58.675 --> 02:00.562
Well, it's not really possible
for you to study less.

02:01.081 --> 02:01.939
You're dead!

02:02.381 --> 02:03.708
You are so dead!
(Gasps)

02:03.911 --> 02:05.202
Oh. Oh!

02:05.429 --> 02:06.425
(Groans)

02:07.275 --> 02:08.966
I'm too depressed to get up.

02:09.312 --> 02:10.548
<i>Well, Axl wasn't the only one</i>

02:10.672 --> 02:12.297
<i>who was gonna have to</i>
<i>start studying.</i>

02:12.459 --> 02:13.788
<i>'Cause the next day</i>
<i>was my first day</i>

02:13.904 --> 02:15.522
<i>of dental assisting school.</i>

02:15.634 --> 02:17.120
<i>Yep, I was back to school</i>

02:17.221 --> 02:18.984
<i>for the first time</i>
<i>in over 20 years.</i>

02:19.128 --> 02:20.000
Oh, Mike,

02:20.219 --> 02:21.755
take a picture of me
with my lunch

02:21.879 --> 02:23.224
like we always said we were
gonna do with the kids

02:23.344 --> 02:25.340
on their first day of school
but never did.

02:26.249 --> 02:27.006
(Clicks)

02:28.091 --> 02:29.543
Battery's dead.

02:29.770 --> 02:32.329
(Pipes groan)

02:32.690 --> 02:33.918
It's doing it again.

02:34.023 --> 02:34.903
Do we need a plumber?

02:35.014 --> 02:36.273
Oh, definitely.

02:36.427 --> 02:38.987
And a roof guy and a mold guy
and a bug guy.

02:39.098 --> 02:40.423
But instead,
we're paying tuition,

02:40.572 --> 02:42.174
and it's all gonna be worth it,
right, Frankie?

02:42.289 --> 02:43.867
Mike, this is not
just my second act.

02:43.995 --> 02:44.981
It's all of ours.

02:45.111 --> 02:46.656
The Hecks are taking risks.

02:46.814 --> 02:48.306
Yeah. We're on
the comeback trail.

02:48.558 --> 02:51.714
Well, four days,
and my hair is still syrupy.

02:51.975 --> 02:53.885
But it's okay.
I deserve it.

02:54.042 --> 02:56.541
I should bear the physical scars
of what I've done.

02:56.672 --> 02:58.741
And bright side,
it smells pretty nice.

02:58.882 --> 03:00.121
Except bees chase me.

03:00.348 --> 03:02.396
(Pipes groan)

03:02.564 --> 03:04.337
All right.
I'm shutting off the water.

03:04.463 --> 03:06.190
If anybody has to go,
now would be the time.

03:06.274 --> 03:08.602
Wait. I have to go again.
No, I'm all right.

03:08.735 --> 03:10.390
Well, maybe I do. Hang on.

03:10.610 --> 03:11.816
No. Okay. I'm good.

03:13.195 --> 03:15.199
Don't forget I have
social skills after school.

03:15.369 --> 03:16.647
We're working
on planning ahead.

03:16.774 --> 03:18.163
I was supposed to tell you
two weeks ago.

03:18.370 --> 03:20.246
And you're in charge
of bringing a healthy snack.

03:20.596 --> 03:21.650
Now?

03:21.942 --> 03:24.437
Now you're telling me this?
This is not a good time, Brick.

03:24.554 --> 03:26.257
- I gotta get to school.
- I'll do it.

03:26.433 --> 03:27.518
I will <i>so</i> do it.

03:27.673 --> 03:29.249
I want to make up
for running over Axl's foot

03:29.389 --> 03:30.600
and ruining everybody's lives.

03:30.749 --> 03:32.674
Okay. Here's 40 bucks.

03:32.812 --> 03:34.196
Now the snacks aren't
gonna cost that much,

03:34.316 --> 03:35.144
so bring back change.

03:35.310 --> 03:37.772
And peanut M&Ms don't count
as a healthy snack.

03:37.927 --> 03:39.454
Learned that one the hard way.

03:43.182 --> 03:44.720
This isn't about
handing out certificates

03:44.841 --> 03:45.963
and sending you on your way.

03:46.104 --> 03:49.613
This is about changing lives
one tooth at a time.

03:49.793 --> 03:51.301
Now I'm going to be
talking about this--

03:52.491 --> 03:55.367
Hi. Oh, sorry. Hi.

03:55.582 --> 03:57.624
(Laughs) Frankie Heck.
I am so sorry.

03:57.779 --> 03:59.170
I was a little nervous.
First day, you know,

03:59.297 --> 04:00.491
and my husband
turned off the water,

04:00.603 --> 04:02.826
so I had to stop
at the karate place to go...

04:02.949 --> 04:04.938
Well, that was too much
information. (Laughs)

04:05.081 --> 04:07.598
Well, you are one brave puppy
coming into my class late,

04:07.722 --> 04:08.844
Frankie Heck.

04:08.976 --> 04:10.562
As the rest of your classmates
already know,

04:10.712 --> 04:11.945
I'm Sandy Armwood,

04:12.071 --> 04:13.311
a thorough dental educator,

04:13.422 --> 04:14.731
according to
a recent Yelp review.

04:14.924 --> 04:17.560
Now dental assisting
is not pretty.

04:17.680 --> 04:19.387
There is going to be spit.

04:19.564 --> 04:20.447
There's going to be blood.

04:20.583 --> 04:22.407
There's going to be
serious gag reflexes.

04:22.560 --> 04:23.509
If you don't think
you're up for it,

04:23.637 --> 04:26.121
if it scares you people,
there's the door.

04:26.283 --> 04:28.139
(Blows raspberry)
I'm not scared. I'm a mom!

04:28.320 --> 04:29.341
(High-pitched laugh)

04:29.976 --> 04:31.509
All right, then,
let's get out our notebooks.

04:31.625 --> 04:34.308
Because it is my honor--
no, it is my duty,

04:35.001 --> 04:36.679
to share my knowledge with you.

04:37.498 --> 04:39.068
I'll start by introducing you
to the maxillary

04:39.213 --> 04:40.492
and mandibular arches.

04:41.157 --> 04:42.952
This is good.
I bought healthy snacks,

04:43.152 --> 04:44.925
I picked you up from school...

04:45.084 --> 04:47.269
I think I'll make
a pretty great mom someday.

04:47.437 --> 04:48.875
(Tires screech, horn honks)
Aah!

04:50.203 --> 04:52.169
Hey, Brick!
Look, a garage sale!

04:52.279 --> 04:53.633
Let's check it out.

04:54.949 --> 04:56.156
(Dog barking in distance)

04:57.369 --> 04:58.221
(Gasps)

04:58.652 --> 05:01.251
Oh... my... God.

05:01.612 --> 05:02.870
I saw something
exactly like this

05:02.995 --> 05:04.039
on Antiques Roadshow.

05:04.172 --> 05:05.965
You know, they appraised it
for a ton of money.

05:06.133 --> 05:07.267
Hmm, I don't know.

05:07.470 --> 05:08.981
It looks like it could
be a cheap copy.

05:09.161 --> 05:10.101
On American Pickers,

05:10.238 --> 05:11.896
I saw someone just throw
one of those away.

05:12.195 --> 05:14.694
You know,
we still have $20 left

05:14.817 --> 05:16.320
from the money
mom gave me for snacks.

05:16.458 --> 05:19.344
If this is worth something,
and we can flip it

05:19.470 --> 05:20.843
like on House Flippers, Miami,

05:20.982 --> 05:22.507
we can bring her back
even more money.

05:22.650 --> 05:25.050
Mom's not working, so we
gotta help out any way we can.

05:25.191 --> 05:26.248
True.

05:26.471 --> 05:29.519
I mean, how could we,
in good conscience, not do it?

05:29.706 --> 05:31.783
I think we have
a real opportunity here.

05:31.917 --> 05:34.986
I mean, clearly, this lady can't
tell things of value from junk.

05:35.113 --> 05:36.762
I learned that one
from watching Hoarders.

05:37.046 --> 05:38.665
The thing I learned
from watching Hoarders

05:38.802 --> 05:40.842
is that it does not usually
end well for the cats.

05:41.569 --> 05:43.610
<i>So while Sue was in heaven</i>
<i>at the garage sale,</i>

05:43.754 --> 05:44.975
<i>Axl was in hell,</i>

05:45.134 --> 05:47.409
<i>otherwise known</i>
<i>as tutor signups.</i>

05:50.025 --> 05:51.506
Hey. No cuts.

05:51.621 --> 05:53.351
You're behind my backpack.
It's holding my place.

05:53.474 --> 05:55.525
Sorry. There's no
holding places.

05:55.743 --> 05:57.389
Well, put it back.
(Backpack slides)

05:57.864 --> 05:59.667
It's my helper backpack.
I'm very injured.

05:59.804 --> 06:01.389
No, you're not.
You're just lazy.

06:01.524 --> 06:02.988
I saw you vault
over two trash cans

06:03.103 --> 06:04.066
on your way in here.

06:04.200 --> 06:07.822
(Scoffs) Are you saying
I'm faking? This is real.

06:07.996 --> 06:09.681
I might be out for the whole
rest of the football season.

06:09.797 --> 06:10.992
Everyone's freaking out.

06:11.129 --> 06:12.670
Oh, yeah. Me, too.

06:12.800 --> 06:15.318
I'm just hiding it
behind not caring at all.

06:15.431 --> 06:17.788
Well...
I probably don't care

06:17.896 --> 06:19.949
about whatever it is
you do, either, so...

06:20.095 --> 06:22.441
Actually, I'm co-founder
of the Green Club,

06:22.573 --> 06:23.932
photographer
on the school paper...

06:24.051 --> 06:24.822
Axl Heck?

06:24.955 --> 06:27.590
Your assigned tutor
is Cassidy Finch.

06:27.722 --> 06:29.450
Well, great. I see you two
have already started

06:29.564 --> 06:30.805
to get to know one another.

06:31.804 --> 06:35.747
Oh. And in my spare time,
I tutor dumb jocks.

06:37.000 --> 06:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:45.535 --> 06:46.654
I'll give you 40 bucks.

06:46.778 --> 06:48.232
<i>- Really?</i>
- Yep.

06:48.373 --> 06:51.871
Just give me one quick sec
to confer with my associate.

06:52.500 --> 06:55.698
- Oh, my God, that's so much money.
(Whispering) - Oh, my God!

06:55.826 --> 06:57.254
- I cannot believe it! Aah!
- We flipped it! Okay.

06:57.927 --> 06:59.403
Yes, I think that will do.

07:00.014 --> 07:01.514
(Cash register drawer opens)

07:02.904 --> 07:04.018
(Squeals)

07:04.800 --> 07:06.161
(Horn honks in distance)

07:06.284 --> 07:07.550
Sue! Hang on.

07:10.040 --> 07:12.083
I saw this exact safe
on Storage Wars.

07:12.212 --> 07:14.541
And when they opened it up,
there was a ton of money inside.

07:15.224 --> 07:17.247
No, Brick. We gotta quit
while we're ahead,

07:17.406 --> 07:19.529
like the smart ones do
on Deal Or No Deal.

07:19.648 --> 07:22.324
Look, $40 isn't gonna
change mom's life.

07:22.468 --> 07:24.325
But $40,000 could.

07:24.482 --> 07:26.224
There might be
pirate doubloons in there.

07:26.427 --> 07:29.043
What do you say, Sue?
Do you wanna let it ride?

07:30.069 --> 07:31.486
(Squeals)

07:31.833 --> 07:33.935
Okay. Let it ride!
(Laughs)

07:34.072 --> 07:37.148
(School bell rings) Okay, backpack boy.
Let's do this.

07:37.485 --> 07:38.306
Yeah, before we dive in,

07:38.422 --> 07:39.729
I wanna be clear
about my goals here.

07:39.894 --> 07:41.315
All right, I don't want
to get too smart,

07:41.449 --> 07:42.750
just smart enough
to get into college.

07:42.913 --> 07:45.287
I think we're safe there.
You ready to start?

07:45.520 --> 07:48.052
- Or do you need me to blow a whistle?
- Wow.

07:48.169 --> 07:49.848
You're making fun of me
for being an awesome athlete.

07:49.953 --> 07:51.632
Ouch. No cracks
about my thick, shiny hair,

07:51.758 --> 07:53.314
or I'll cry out
of my piercing blue eyes.

07:53.499 --> 07:56.048
Boy, you sure do love yourself
some <i>you,</i> don't ya?

07:56.261 --> 07:58.508
Look, I'm not sure I get
why you're hating on me so bad

07:58.623 --> 07:59.845
'cause I play sports.

07:59.953 --> 08:01.293
I don't think you realize
what a public service

08:01.424 --> 08:02.517
we do for this school.

08:02.651 --> 08:03.793
We're, like,
totally responsible

08:03.925 --> 08:05.743
for, like, all the caring,
and all the trophies,

08:05.896 --> 08:07.613
and all the coolness and stuff.

08:07.746 --> 08:10.430
Oh, my God. All the coolness
and stuff is you?

08:10.579 --> 08:12.170
Thanks so much.

08:12.561 --> 08:13.448
(Pen scribbling)

08:13.569 --> 08:14.622
You always this much fun?

08:14.746 --> 08:16.058
I'll have fun
next year at college,

08:16.158 --> 08:17.442
which you don't have a prayer
of getting into

08:17.575 --> 08:19.414
unless you open that book.

08:20.160 --> 08:21.832
(Sighs) So, what, are you
already accepted into...

08:21.937 --> 08:23.496
(Haughty voice)
<i>Harvard</i> or something?

08:23.649 --> 08:25.836
Vassar, actually.
(Laughs)

08:28.094 --> 08:29.314
Vassar?

08:29.994 --> 08:31.427
It has "ass" in it.

08:31.579 --> 08:33.793
Wow.
I feel sorry for you.

08:33.982 --> 08:36.302
Your whole identity is
this tiny locker room world

08:36.429 --> 08:37.464
you think you're king of.

08:37.585 --> 08:38.871
And now you're injured
and you're scared,

08:39.005 --> 08:40.609
so you're putting up
an imperious facade

08:40.744 --> 08:43.621
and overcompensating
for your insecurity.

08:44.629 --> 08:46.566
Okay, if you're trying
to insult me,

08:46.689 --> 08:48.310
you're gonna have to
use smaller words.

08:49.609 --> 08:52.068
<i>After a day at school,</i>
<i>I was beginning to understand</i>

08:52.202 --> 08:54.551
<i>Axl's love affair</i>
<i>with our couch.</i>

08:55.811 --> 08:57.099
- What are you doing?
- Shh!

08:57.508 --> 08:58.921
I saw this on Safe Crackers.

08:59.133 --> 09:00.056
Did it work?

09:00.226 --> 09:01.178
I don't know.

09:01.334 --> 09:03.283
After five minutes,
I switched over to Whale Wars.

09:03.426 --> 09:04.996
But I do feel fairly confident

09:05.121 --> 09:07.553
that I can commandeer
a Japanese harpoon ship.

09:07.681 --> 09:09.961
<i>Sue and Brick were making</i>
<i>as much progress with that safe</i>

09:10.089 --> 09:11.721
<i>as Axl was with his tutor.</i>

09:11.886 --> 09:14.784
So your score of 0 out of 20
on the quiz

09:14.913 --> 09:16.301
makes it pretty clear
that you read nothing

09:16.456 --> 09:18.085
about the Bay Of Pigs invasion.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.640
Well, in my defense,

09:19.762 --> 09:21.143
I was totally sitting down
to read this,

09:21.258 --> 09:23.250
when the guys called me
and invited me to the lake.

09:23.371 --> 09:24.857
(Laughs) Everyone was there.
(Pen clicks)

09:24.968 --> 09:27.310
And PS--
awesomeness ensued.

09:27.417 --> 09:28.248
(Pen clicks) Why didn't you go?

09:28.372 --> 09:29.571
See, this is why
I hate high school.

09:29.731 --> 09:31.614
All everyone does
is go to lame parties.

09:31.769 --> 09:33.479
And for your information,
I had to study.

09:33.661 --> 09:35.404
And so should you.
You have a test tomorrow.

09:35.525 --> 09:36.442
No. The teacher said
yesterday

09:36.554 --> 09:38.984
it was the day after tomorrow.

09:39.224 --> 09:42.607
Wow. God does not give
with both hands.

09:42.886 --> 09:43.968
And that means what?

09:44.324 --> 09:47.192
It means attractive people
are usually not that bright.

09:48.434 --> 09:50.036
You think I'm attractive?

09:50.167 --> 09:51.373
I didn't mean it that way.

09:51.516 --> 09:53.500
- Hmm.
- Okay, um, so where was I?

09:53.725 --> 09:56.632
The Bay Of Pigs. Right.
It's important 'cause, um,

09:56.765 --> 09:58.353
it was a crucial moment
in history.

09:58.553 --> 10:00.002
I mean, those three days
were fraught

10:00.145 --> 10:01.513
with confusion and tension.

10:01.688 --> 10:03.502
JFK had only been in office
a couple of months.

10:03.646 --> 10:04.925
He barely knew
what he was doing,

10:05.050 --> 10:06.812
and yet he knew
he had to take bold action.

10:06.979 --> 10:08.062
He deployed--

10:12.906 --> 10:14.773
How you like high school now?
(Clicks tongue)

10:14.928 --> 10:15.615
(Chuckles)

10:15.738 --> 10:16.915
Seriously?

10:17.320 --> 10:18.524
Oh, my God.
I have to go.

10:18.635 --> 10:21.409
What? Oh... you were vibing me
all these signals,

10:21.539 --> 10:22.748
and you were saying how
you never go to parties,

10:22.840 --> 10:23.582
and you were talking
about tension

10:23.696 --> 10:25.798
and deployment and stuff.
What was I supposed to do?

10:32.128 --> 10:34.325
<i>So I'd gotten off</i>
<i>to a bad start with my teacher.</i>

10:34.446 --> 10:35.511
<i>But if there's</i>
<i>one thing I'd learned</i>

10:35.638 --> 10:36.686
<i>from working at Ehlert's,</i>

10:36.811 --> 10:38.653
<i>it was the fine art</i>
<i>of sucking up.</i>

10:38.767 --> 10:41.648
Hi. I know. Late again.
What are the odds?

10:41.773 --> 10:43.408
But I made you
some snickerdoodles.

10:43.527 --> 10:45.008
Oh. (Laughs)

10:45.181 --> 10:46.594
Look, everybody.

10:46.807 --> 10:49.267
Gingivitis on a plate.

10:49.677 --> 10:51.527
(Thud) You know what those
cookies tell me, Frankie?

10:51.665 --> 10:53.726
You do not respect the tooth.

10:54.133 --> 10:56.709
(Glove snaps) Oh, I do.
I completely respect the tooth,

10:56.846 --> 10:58.143
so, so much.

10:58.269 --> 10:59.661
Ah. Well, good to hear it.

10:59.820 --> 11:01.316
And since you're not
in your seat,

11:01.457 --> 11:03.399
why don't you take
this one right here?

11:03.541 --> 11:04.678
- Oh--
- Attagirl.

11:04.807 --> 11:06.336
There we go. Going down.

11:06.463 --> 11:07.879
Okay. Well, you know what?
I think it would be better-- (Chair motor whirs)

11:08.019 --> 11:09.362
Wowzers!

11:09.486 --> 11:13.031
You have some seriously,
seriously inflamed gums.

11:13.162 --> 11:15.689
- Really? - I see you had a couple of
those cookies in the car, too, huh?

11:15.812 --> 11:17.463
Everybody, gather around!

11:18.253 --> 11:19.553
(Chairs scrape floor)

11:20.297 --> 11:22.744
This is an excellent example
of the oral carelessness

11:22.883 --> 11:24.192
we've been discussing today.

11:24.340 --> 11:25.938
Now I want everyone
to reach in there

11:26.086 --> 11:28.097
and feel that frenum.

11:28.915 --> 11:30.265
(Muffled voice)
Uh, hold on a sec.

11:30.389 --> 11:31.948
No. Come on, come on,
come on. Go, go.

11:32.040 --> 11:33.271
Really get in there. Don't be shy.
(Muffled shouting)

11:33.389 --> 11:34.797
<i>Yep, there's no doubt</i>
<i>about it--</i>

11:34.935 --> 11:35.975
<i>I was miserable...</i>
(Groans)

11:36.100 --> 11:38.650
<i>Axl was miserable...</i>
(Groans)

11:39.252 --> 11:40.941
<i>Even the house was miserable.</i>

11:41.087 --> 11:42.805
(Pipes groan)

11:42.910 --> 11:44.322
You're only
a few classes in, right?

11:44.444 --> 11:46.211
Is it too late to switch you
to plumbing school?

11:46.363 --> 11:49.003
Hey, I swallowed someone's
fake fingernail today.

11:49.136 --> 11:50.490
This is really not the time.

11:50.614 --> 11:51.636
Ugh!

11:51.861 --> 11:53.679
It's 10:00 and I still have
26 more pages!

11:53.794 --> 11:55.915
Mom, you gotta help me study.
Here...

11:56.056 --> 11:57.781
It's
the constitutional amendments.

11:57.892 --> 11:59.370
Just so you know,
those are Roman numerals.

11:59.500 --> 12:00.784
Turns out they're not
just for Super Bowls.

12:00.904 --> 12:04.078
Axl, I can't. I have
a huge anatomy test tomorrow.

12:04.205 --> 12:05.369
Uh, hello!

12:05.519 --> 12:07.086
You're always telling me
to ask you for help,

12:07.204 --> 12:08.805
and now I'm saying I need help,
and you won't?

12:08.948 --> 12:10.786
- This is so typical.
- You don't understand.

12:10.923 --> 12:12.779
My teacher's mean
and she hates me.

12:12.911 --> 12:14.972
That's what I tell you
all the time! And you tell me,

12:15.166 --> 12:16.309
"I'm sure she has a good heart.

12:16.450 --> 12:18.223
She's just trying
to make you be your best."

12:18.378 --> 12:20.983
Ugh. How do you live with me
if I say things like that?

12:21.106 --> 12:22.221
Shut up, Frankie.

12:22.358 --> 12:24.128
Look, we gotta get you
into college,

12:24.253 --> 12:25.865
and you out of college
and back into a job,

12:26.004 --> 12:27.529
so let's knock this out.

12:28.128 --> 12:32.523
Okay, what are
the mandibular incisors?

12:32.651 --> 12:34.093
Oh, my God.
I have no idea!

12:34.290 --> 12:35.755
That was for your mom.

12:35.907 --> 12:37.550
Oh, crap.
I have no idea, either.

12:37.685 --> 12:38.849
Pass.
(Sighs)

12:40.840 --> 12:42.716
What's
the 12th amendment revise?

12:42.841 --> 12:44.162
Can I have
the incisors question again?

12:45.403 --> 12:47.520
Seven layers of the tooth. Go.

12:47.721 --> 12:50.283
I don't know. Oh, my God, what
made me think I could do this?

12:50.421 --> 12:52.992
I'm too old. My brain is mush.
(Pills rattle)

12:53.115 --> 12:54.771
It doesn't hold
new thoughts anymore.

12:54.891 --> 12:55.789
Hey. Over here.

12:55.910 --> 12:57.208
Oh, you have a headache, too?

12:57.407 --> 12:58.757
Will you two man up?
(Pills rattle)

12:58.867 --> 13:00.025
I've had a headache
for ten years.

13:00.160 --> 13:01.393
You don't see me whining.

13:01.519 --> 13:03.189
Let's just do this,
and then you can go to bed.

13:03.326 --> 13:04.110
Everybody's tired.

13:04.226 --> 13:05.215
The only people getting
any sleep in this house

13:05.344 --> 13:06.315
are Sue and Brick.

13:07.093 --> 13:08.109
(Snaps) Ah.

13:09.007 --> 13:10.087
Cheese grater.

13:11.101 --> 13:12.754
I don't know.
I just don't know.

13:12.868 --> 13:14.376
Let me just close my eyes
for ten minutes,

13:14.549 --> 13:15.828
and I'll have the answer.

13:16.032 --> 13:18.703
Come on, Frankie.
What's with you? Suck it up!

13:18.831 --> 13:21.240
I know you're tired, but you got
a long way to go here.

13:21.403 --> 13:24.208
I'm just <i>so tired.</i>

13:26.242 --> 13:28.175
Wait, wait, wait.
Frankie, is this what you took?

13:28.320 --> 13:29.234
Yeah.

13:29.365 --> 13:30.642
It's Tylenol PM.

13:30.961 --> 13:33.095
PM-- that's why it's got
the moon and the stars on it.

13:33.200 --> 13:34.368
It's the kind
that makes you go to sleep.

13:34.506 --> 13:35.896
- What?
- Oh, my God.

13:36.073 --> 13:37.497
My mother drugged me?

13:37.778 --> 13:39.656
And I have a test
tomorrow on...

13:40.210 --> 13:41.842
I have no idea what I have
a test tomorrow on.

13:42.084 --> 13:43.555
(Moans)
Look, I'm all right, Mike.

13:43.691 --> 13:46.165
Just ask Rascal
his questions first,

13:46.306 --> 13:48.431
and I'll just rest my eyes.

13:48.621 --> 13:50.176
(Both grunting)

13:52.978 --> 13:54.299
Okay. That was good.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.559
Now let that sink in,
and I'll let you rest a second.

13:56.686 --> 13:59.000
Okay, Frankie, tell me
what you know about root canals.

13:59.125 --> 14:00.182
Other than they're
probably more fun

14:00.309 --> 14:01.450
than this night is for me.

14:01.574 --> 14:03.180
The root canals...

14:03.403 --> 14:06.682
in Venice are supposed to be
so pretty.

14:06.807 --> 14:08.971
We should go there.
Ah, we'll never go there.

14:09.122 --> 14:10.412
Hey, whoa. Whoa, whoa.

14:10.623 --> 14:12.906
Axl, come on, buddy.
Stay with me.

14:13.040 --> 14:16.265
My tutor is pretty
and smart and she hates me.

14:16.484 --> 14:17.442
(Exhales)

14:17.551 --> 14:20.113
I clogged the toilet
at the karate place.

14:21.613 --> 14:22.878
(Thud)

14:27.766 --> 14:28.505
Okay...

14:29.568 --> 14:30.785
One...

14:30.912 --> 14:32.088
Two...

14:32.393 --> 14:33.067
Three!

14:33.616 --> 14:34.493
(Clang)

14:35.103 --> 14:37.204
(Thud, debris clatters)

14:37.291 --> 14:38.330
Oh! Oh, my God.

14:38.433 --> 14:39.762
That did not just happen again.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.371
Mom is going to kill us!
(Breathes heavily)

14:43.228 --> 14:45.264
Hey, wait.
I see something.

14:45.396 --> 14:46.921
Yeah, I know, Brick.
I see it, too--

14:47.073 --> 14:48.152
a giant hole,

14:48.264 --> 14:50.266
right where
the old giant hole was.

14:50.435 --> 14:52.727
No. Look. It's open!

14:58.464 --> 14:59.472
(door creaks)

14:59.962 --> 15:01.458
There's nothing in here
except some maps

15:01.588 --> 15:04.619
and an old...
rental car receipt.

15:05.024 --> 15:05.788
Ugh!

15:07.427 --> 15:09.242
(Sighs) I knew we shouldn't
have bought the safe.

15:09.528 --> 15:11.573
I knew it! But I let you
talk me into it,

15:11.700 --> 15:13.497
and now we have nothing
to give back to mom.

15:13.622 --> 15:14.476
Nothing!

15:14.602 --> 15:16.387
Nothing
but this stupid receipt,

15:16.540 --> 15:20.172
signed by...
Ger-<i>ahld</i> Ford.

15:20.315 --> 15:22.353
The President?
Gerald Ford?

15:24.223 --> 15:27.247
It says it's from October 1974.

15:28.871 --> 15:30.831
Oh, my God.
Do you know what this means?

15:30.956 --> 15:32.446
I'm getting my Robot Butler!

15:32.566 --> 15:33.992
(Whispers) Robot Butler.

15:34.124 --> 15:35.410
Aah! Ha!

15:35.940 --> 15:38.064
(Gasps and kisses)

15:38.431 --> 15:40.369
You know, Rick,
according to my research,

15:40.514 --> 15:43.404
President Ford was
in Indianapolis in 1974

15:43.565 --> 15:45.701
trying to help Senator Lugar
get elected.

15:45.858 --> 15:48.512
So you see that it has
a real historical significance.

15:49.123 --> 15:50.240
I don't know.

15:51.184 --> 15:53.349
Guys, you really can't
make out the signature.

15:53.480 --> 15:55.802
There's no way to know
who this belonged to.

15:55.925 --> 15:57.180
And I'm pretty sure
the president

15:57.318 --> 15:59.255
wasn't renting an AMC gremlin.

15:59.706 --> 16:00.859
But I like you kids.

16:01.407 --> 16:03.647
So how 'bout me giving you
20 bucks for this?

16:04.098 --> 16:06.813
Um, we're gonna need a sidebar.

16:08.850 --> 16:10.281
(Lowered voice) It's clearly
not worth anything.

16:10.417 --> 16:12.926
So let's just take the $20,
which is what we started with,

16:13.099 --> 16:14.401
and cut our losses.

16:14.567 --> 16:15.641
(Lowered voice)
Brick, think about it--

16:15.762 --> 16:17.159
if that wasn't
the president's signature,

16:17.283 --> 16:18.977
he wouldn't be offering us
anything at all.

16:19.121 --> 16:21.043
Obviously, he thinks
it's worth way more.

16:21.176 --> 16:22.700
He's just trying to lowball us.

16:24.477 --> 16:26.476
Rick, we think
we can do better.

16:26.613 --> 16:28.129
Sorry, we're walking away.

16:30.529 --> 16:32.220
And pencils down.

16:32.408 --> 16:33.816
<i>Thank God that was over.</i>

16:33.948 --> 16:35.913
Now it's time for
the clinical part of our exam.

16:36.082 --> 16:38.168
Let's start with
our blood pressure skills.

16:38.332 --> 16:39.938
Frankie, roll 'em up.

16:42.112 --> 16:43.995
Uh, you know what?
I'd-- I'd rather not.

16:44.105 --> 16:45.800
I feel like I've been
hogging all the volunteering.

16:45.923 --> 16:48.736
I'm sure someone else
would like a chance...

16:48.837 --> 16:50.386
What is that?

16:51.653 --> 16:55.022
Hey. If you're really desperate,
I could hook you up.

16:55.151 --> 16:57.241
(Pen clicks) (Sighs)
Here's how you do it.

16:57.381 --> 17:00.766
All right. Okay. "Mesial..."

17:00.891 --> 17:02.428
(Laughs) That tickles.

17:02.559 --> 17:03.659
Let me explain.

17:03.785 --> 17:05.412
This wouldn't happen
under normal circumstances,

17:05.536 --> 17:08.152
- but my son and I were taking drugs
together-- - (Sighs) Frankie...

17:08.625 --> 17:09.865
Isn't it time?

17:10.125 --> 17:11.295
Isn't it time
you accept the fact

17:11.429 --> 17:12.915
that you don't have
what it takes to make it

17:13.040 --> 17:15.371
in the high-pressure world
of dental assisting?

17:15.554 --> 17:16.720
Why don't you
do yourself a favor?

17:16.845 --> 17:17.671
Why don't you
walk out that door

17:17.785 --> 17:19.501
and find something
more your speed, like...

17:19.883 --> 17:22.603
running a hair extension kiosk
at the mall?

17:24.029 --> 17:26.932
You think I'm just
gonna walk out of here?

17:27.414 --> 17:29.900
That I'm just gonna quit
because <i>you</i> told me to?

17:30.061 --> 17:32.543
Well, let me tell you
something about myself--

17:33.262 --> 17:34.439
I...

17:34.925 --> 17:36.158
am a quitter.

17:36.341 --> 17:38.123
A lifelong quitter.

17:38.455 --> 17:40.257
Girl Scouts? Quit.

17:40.467 --> 17:42.434
Piano lessons when they started
with two hands?

17:42.625 --> 17:43.492
Quit.

17:43.593 --> 17:44.245
Working out at Curves?

17:44.366 --> 17:46.679
Quit in the middle of signing up
for the membership.

17:46.947 --> 17:49.004
Every volunteer thing
at my kids' school,

17:49.137 --> 17:50.093
quit, quit, quit.

17:50.223 --> 17:52.740
Oh, and I only got
through 20 "shades of grey."

17:52.889 --> 17:55.720
So if I quit-- and yeah,
I might if it gets too hard--

17:55.881 --> 17:57.647
I'm gonna do it on <i>my</i> terms.

17:57.800 --> 17:59.108
It might be tomorrow.

17:59.264 --> 18:01.921
It might be next week.
It might be the week after!

18:02.081 --> 18:06.275
But definitely not today.

18:10.610 --> 18:11.985
Okay.

18:13.144 --> 18:15.081
Did you see Rick's face?

18:15.231 --> 18:16.973
He totally knew
what this thing was worth.

18:17.112 --> 18:19.066
Of course he did. But we're
gonna have the last laugh

18:19.205 --> 18:20.694
when this thing
is at the Smithsonian,

18:20.831 --> 18:22.905
and we're living in our mansion
in Orson Heights.

18:23.038 --> 18:24.199
(Laughs)

18:26.475 --> 18:27.875
Although...

18:28.010 --> 18:31.707
The L in Gerald kind of
looks more like an R.

18:31.907 --> 18:33.222
And the O in Ford

18:33.356 --> 18:35.198
kind of looks more like a U.

18:35.773 --> 18:38.512
In which case, we have
the 1974 rental car receipt

18:38.675 --> 18:40.163
of some guy named...

18:40.346 --> 18:42.242
Gerard Furd?

18:44.049 --> 18:47.158
Rick, we feel we have
a long-standing

18:47.308 --> 18:48.724
business relationship with you,

18:48.924 --> 18:51.126
and it's not just
about the money, so...

18:51.244 --> 18:52.698
- We'll take the $20.
- Yeah.

18:52.813 --> 18:53.670
I'll give you $10.

18:53.779 --> 18:55.454
- What?
- You offered us $20 before.

18:55.581 --> 18:58.168
- Okay, $9.
- Wait, you can't just <i>lower</i> your offer.

18:58.305 --> 19:00.541
- $7.
- Sell! Sell! Sell!

19:00.662 --> 19:02.593
- All right. All right. All right. We'll
take the $7. - It's Furd, for God sake.

19:02.905 --> 19:04.265
(Register drawer opens)

19:09.496 --> 19:11.342
Oh. Hey.

19:12.405 --> 19:13.507
Hey.

19:14.080 --> 19:15.152
Um...

19:16.702 --> 19:18.748
Look, I know I'm the last person
you wanna see,

19:18.908 --> 19:21.133
but, uh, I just wanted
to let you know

19:21.251 --> 19:24.053
I got a B
on that government test.

19:24.193 --> 19:25.278
Really?

19:25.440 --> 19:27.500
That's great, Axl.
Nice job.

19:27.627 --> 19:28.366
Yeah.

19:28.506 --> 19:30.026
Um, I know things are...

19:30.343 --> 19:33.640
kind of weird between us now
'cause of that... kiss thing.

19:33.769 --> 19:36.033
So I get it if you don't
want to tutor me anymore.

19:36.349 --> 19:38.137
It was lame of me.
(Chuckles nervously)

19:38.316 --> 19:40.501
You hated it.
Sorry and stuff.

19:40.653 --> 19:42.809
Um, so... (Clears throat)
Just to recap...

19:43.231 --> 19:45.517
(Chuckles) Me-- lame. Bye.

19:46.107 --> 19:47.526
I didn't hate it.

19:49.772 --> 19:50.782
You didn't?

19:51.121 --> 19:52.613
No, um...

19:53.034 --> 19:54.902
Actually, it was
kind of pleasant.

19:55.584 --> 19:57.664
But the thing is,
I have a boyfriend.

19:57.782 --> 20:00.590
He's away at college.
So it's moot.

20:00.814 --> 20:02.917
Cool. Cool. Yeah.

20:03.063 --> 20:06.153
Um... uh, yeah. Well...

20:06.452 --> 20:08.095
If you ever break up
with that moot guy,

20:08.897 --> 20:10.100
let me know.

20:12.180 --> 20:13.132
Ow.

20:14.085 --> 20:16.553
<i>Sometimes life knocks us down.</i>

20:17.187 --> 20:19.246
(Pipes groan) <i>Sometimes
it knocks us down a lot.</i>

20:19.385 --> 20:21.317
Okay, there it is.
(Sighs)

20:21.667 --> 20:22.657
I figured out the problem.

20:23.262 --> 20:24.651
The house is broken.

20:25.170 --> 20:26.231
Really?

20:26.346 --> 20:27.412
That's your expert opinion?

20:27.535 --> 20:29.871
Yeah. It's groaning
because it's tired,

20:30.090 --> 20:31.428
much like the people in it.

20:31.742 --> 20:33.854
Oh, see what
you're doing there?

20:34.010 --> 20:35.032
Grinding your teeth.

20:35.157 --> 20:37.281
Your mandibular molars,
to be exact.

20:37.789 --> 20:40.586
Oh, my God.
Mike, I learned something.

20:40.708 --> 20:42.090
I didn't used to
know that before.

20:42.463 --> 20:43.154
Oh!

20:43.767 --> 20:45.660
<i>But there's that</i>
<i>tiny glimmer of hope</i>

20:45.787 --> 20:48.175
<i>that lets us believe</i>
<i>that by some miracle,</i>

20:48.338 --> 20:49.577
<i>it'll all work out.</i>

20:51.167 --> 20:52.373
<i>And then again,</i>

20:52.498 --> 20:55.373
<i>sometimes we just</i>
<i>don't know when to quit.</i>
