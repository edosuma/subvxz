Morning!
God, I'm so late!

00:05.241 --> 00:07.642
I'm okay,
I just caught my shoe.

00:07.644 --> 00:09.577

00:33.670 --> 00:35.336
Everything's crooked.

Wow, he burns
down the barn?

01:13.009 --> 01:14.475
I did not see
that coming.

01:14.477 --> 01:17.144
Isaac, you wrote it.
How drunk were you last night?

01:17.146 --> 01:18.813
Eh, pretty drunk.

01:18.815 --> 01:20.481
Girl, you know
I am your number one fan,

01:20.483 --> 01:22.216
but nobody faints like that.

01:22.218 --> 01:24.518
Mimi, stuff like that faint
got me on the cover

01:24.520 --> 01:26.354
of "Cosmo en Español"
ten times.

01:26.356 --> 01:28.723
- Hugo!
- God.

01:28.725 --> 01:30.891
- Hugo!
- Oh.

01:30.893 --> 01:32.893
Got him.

01:32.895 --> 01:36.697
There you are, sugar butt.
Thanks, Ana.

01:36.699 --> 01:38.466
Why is the lady from
the network here?

01:38.468 --> 01:40.034
Is someone getting fired?

01:43.172 --> 01:45.106
Job security.

01:45.108 --> 01:46.274
I think I know why.

01:46.276 --> 01:47.808
We're getting
a new cast member.

01:47.810 --> 01:49.610
Oh, my God!

01:49.612 --> 01:51.912
You guys, I think
it's Enrique Iglesias.

01:51.914 --> 01:53.914
I've been asking the network
to let us work together.

01:53.916 --> 01:55.516
I love Enrique.

01:55.518 --> 01:56.851
He's who I think about
during our sex scenes.

01:56.853 --> 01:58.953
Oh, my God, me too!

01:58.955 --> 02:01.055
Ana, great scene.
Great faint.

02:01.057 --> 02:03.524
Oh, thanks, Stacey.

02:03.526 --> 02:05.960
What's going on, are we
getting a new cast member?

02:05.962 --> 02:08.262
We are.
He's here.

02:08.264 --> 02:10.631
And he is an old friend
of yours.

02:11.968 --> 02:14.735
Enrique!

02:14.737 --> 02:16.003
Xavi.

02:16.005 --> 02:18.306
Hello, Ana Sofia.

02:18.308 --> 02:19.340
Ahh.

02:21.444 --> 02:23.377
Now that was a faint.

Look, there's a new

I bet he hired Xavi to shake
things up, and you and Xavi

02:59.582 --> 03:01.315
were the world's most famous
Latino couple.

03:01.317 --> 03:03.083

Gael, aren't you upset
about this?

03:06.389 --> 03:09.023
Now you have another hot guy
to compete with.

03:09.025 --> 03:11.525
Well, now I am.

03:11.527 --> 03:13.027
I'm not gonna let this

03:41.190 --> 03:43.557
Xavi and I just had
a little disagreement.

I thought marriage was

You were so in love, then for
it all to come crashing down,

04:24.100 --> 04:25.566
and so publicly!

The big guns bringing your ex on

04:49.358 --> 04:52.259
because you can't carry a show
by yourself anymore.

04:52.261 --> 04:54.328

04:54.330 --> 04:57.397
Mira... why doesn't Isabela
like Ana?

04:57.399 --> 04:58.899
Isabela used to be
the leading lady,

04:58.901 --> 05:00.834
until the day Ana
took her place.

05:00.836 --> 05:02.436
She did not handle it well.

05:02.438 --> 05:04.438
They can't -- do this!

05:04.440 --> 05:07.441

that you've been seeing.

05:13.983 --> 05:16.316
Oh, wait.
You're alone.

05:18.521 --> 05:21.989
Hey, I know Isabela's crazy,
but is she right?

05:21.991 --> 05:23.657
They put Xavi here
'cause I'm not enough?

05:23.659 --> 05:27.294
Of course you're enough.
The fans love you.

05:27.296 --> 05:28.829
- Mimi!
- Hmm, hmm?

05:28.831 --> 05:30.464

05:30.466 --> 05:33.200
Oh, sweetie,
of course people love you.

05:33.202 --> 05:34.568
I mean, the fact
that anyone

05:34.570 --> 05:36.336
bought your Christmas album
proves that.

05:36.338 --> 05:38.305
Xavi is just here because
some stupid network president

05:38.307 --> 05:39.773
is trying
to make his mark.

05:39.775 --> 05:41.408
You guys are right.
This is no big deal.

05:41.410 --> 05:43.510
- Okay.
- I'm just gonna go about my day

05:43.512 --> 05:45.012
like he's not even here.

05:45.014 --> 05:47.381
- Ooh!
- Oh!

05:47.383 --> 05:49.316
You never look
where you're going.

05:49.318 --> 05:51.118
You were always
so freaking quiet.

05:51.120 --> 05:52.786
It was like living
with a Prius.

05:52.788 --> 05:54.721
All right, look, if we're
gonna work together,

05:54.723 --> 05:57.090
- we need to be more civil.
- Okay.

05:57.092 --> 05:58.592
Hey, how's the house
we bought together

05:58.594 --> 06:00.894
- but I don't get to live in?
- Great.

06:00.896 --> 06:02.329
How's the boat I spent
eight months redecorating

06:02.331 --> 06:04.364
until I realized
our marriage was a sham?

06:04.366 --> 06:06.700
- Super.
- Awesome catching up.

06:06.702 --> 06:08.702
So, this show
is a well-oiled machine.

06:08.704 --> 06:10.170
If you're gonna work here,

06:10.172 --> 06:11.505
you're gonna need
to follow some rules.

06:11.507 --> 06:13.240
First, always be on time.

06:13.242 --> 06:15.242
Second, no cell phones on set.

06:15.244 --> 06:17.344
I hate when people make mistakes
'cause they're texting a friend,

06:17.346 --> 06:20.180
"Oh, Ana's even prettier in
person," or you know, whatever.

06:20.182 --> 06:23.250
Shocker. My bossy ex-wife
has a lot of rules.

06:23.252 --> 06:26.854
Well, it is
"Las Leyes de Pasión."

06:26.856 --> 06:28.522
I'm Pasión.

06:28.524 --> 06:30.591
And one more thing.
We don't do gum on the show.

06:30.593 --> 06:32.159
I hate the sound.

06:36.398 --> 06:38.098
I really didn't
think that through.

06:43.439 --> 06:45.072
You think Xavier's
hotter than me?

06:45.074 --> 06:46.506
Gael, come on,
not this again.

06:46.508 --> 06:48.242
This is just like when
we had that horse on set

06:48.244 --> 06:50.110
and you were worried
it had better hair than you.

06:50.112 --> 06:51.178
I'm over that.

06:51.180 --> 06:53.480
I found out what shampoo
he uses.

06:53.482 --> 06:55.182
- Ow, ow, ow!
- Sorry.

06:55.184 --> 06:56.917
But if you had just
worn the one I already had ready

06:56.919 --> 06:58.986
instead of making me work on
this one last minute.

06:58.988 --> 07:00.921
It doesn't matter.
Gael's gonna rip it off me

07:00.923 --> 07:03.824
in the next scene anyway.

07:03.826 --> 07:05.759
He's on the phone!

07:05.761 --> 07:09.296
He's already
breaking my rules!

07:09.298 --> 07:10.297
Excuse me.

07:10.299 --> 07:11.798
No cell phones on set.

07:14.536 --> 07:16.603
He's ignoring me?

07:16.605 --> 07:19.039
Doesn't he know
who's on the post--

07:20.776 --> 07:22.476
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

07:22.478 --> 07:24.511
- Oh, my God.
<i>- Ay, Dios mio.</i>

07:29.495 --> 07:32.597
So it begins.

07:34.267 --> 07:35.733
Okay, okay, here I go.

07:37.370 --> 07:39.770
Okay, I'm doing morning
announcements,

07:39.772 --> 07:41.439
even if some people
aren't ready.

07:41.441 --> 07:43.341
I gotta go.

07:43.343 --> 07:45.710
Don't forget to sign the
get well card for Paco's mom.

07:45.712 --> 07:47.044
It's Paulo.

07:47.046 --> 07:48.513
Okay, we're gonna need
a new card.

07:48.515 --> 07:50.915
And Rodrigo is still
looking for volunteers

07:50.917 --> 07:52.950
to sing a capella
at the animal hospital.

07:52.952 --> 07:55.486
We're just short
two altos.

07:55.488 --> 07:57.355
All right, everybody,
let's have a great day!

07:58.791 --> 08:00.892
I'd like to make
an announcement too.

08:00.894 --> 08:04.328
I just, uh-- I want to thank you
all for having me here.

08:04.330 --> 08:06.464
Aw!

08:06.466 --> 08:07.565
Okay, all right.

08:07.567 --> 08:09.834
Yeah, one more announcement.

08:09.836 --> 08:11.469
Today's going to be amazing,

08:11.471 --> 08:14.605
so let's just all be focused
and professional.

08:14.607 --> 08:16.941
- Yep, professional.
- Like no phone calls.

08:16.943 --> 08:18.276
You're right.
You're right,

08:18.278 --> 08:21.178
but that call was
to my buddy Dwyane Wade.

08:21.180 --> 08:23.281
I got you all
Heat tickets, baby!

08:28.688 --> 08:30.655
Okay, hey!
Hey, hey, wait, wait!

08:30.657 --> 08:32.557
You know, what we want more
than basketball tickets

08:32.558 --> 08:34.357
is a little respect, huh?
Yeah.

08:34.360 --> 08:35.826
Do we get a choice?

08:35.828 --> 08:36.861
I'd rather have
basketball tickets.

08:36.863 --> 08:38.629
What? No?

08:41.034 --> 08:43.200
Hey, get back here!
What was that?

08:43.202 --> 08:44.569
Do you know what I love

08:44.571 --> 08:46.304
about not being married
to you anymore?

08:46.306 --> 08:47.672
I mean, besides not having
my eyebrows plucked

08:47.674 --> 08:49.273
when I'm sleeping?

08:49.275 --> 08:51.275
I love that I don't have
to listen to you anymore.

08:51.277 --> 08:53.177
You know, you just
do whatever you want, huh?

08:53.179 --> 08:55.112
First it's a phone call,
then it's skipping rehearsal,

08:55.114 --> 08:56.614
then it's you cheating
on me with Shakira.

08:56.616 --> 08:58.115
Aha! And there it is,
for the millionth time.

08:58.117 --> 08:59.517
I never slept with Shakira.

08:59.519 --> 09:01.352
- You're a liar.
- And you're ridiculous.

09:01.354 --> 09:04.522
Oh, you know our boat?
The one you decorated?

09:04.524 --> 09:05.990
I threw out all
the throw pillows.

09:05.992 --> 09:07.992
Get off my show!

09:07.994 --> 09:09.727
- Make me.
- Oh!

09:09.729 --> 09:10.861
Wait, wait!
Where are you going?

09:10.863 --> 09:13.197
That dress is just pinned on!

09:16.002 --> 09:17.702
We have a problem here.
I--

09:19.505 --> 09:21.472
I'll call you back.

09:21.474 --> 09:23.674
- Ana Sofia.
- Oh.

09:23.676 --> 09:25.977
You're the new
network president?

09:25.979 --> 09:27.812
Not what I was expecting.

09:27.814 --> 09:29.847
- Little whiter.
- Little bit.

09:41.094 --> 09:42.493
You know what?
We'll just keep it caszh.

09:42.495 --> 09:43.761
- Stick to English.
- Absolutely.

09:43.763 --> 09:46.297
- Please, have a seat.
- Okay.

09:46.299 --> 09:49.000
Listen, Mr. McMa-- aah!

09:49.002 --> 09:50.034
Oh.

09:51.537 --> 09:53.404
- Mr. McMann--
- James.

09:53.406 --> 09:56.407
Xavier joined the show.
I should've been told.

09:59.912 --> 10:02.246
Xavier-- Xavier was
a last minute ratings decision

10:02.248 --> 10:04.949
because people are dying to see
you two back together.

10:04.951 --> 10:06.817
Still, you should
have been informed.

10:06.819 --> 10:09.720
I paid a lot of lawyers-- aah!

10:09.722 --> 10:12.556
A lot of money to make sure
I never have to see Xavi again,

10:12.558 --> 10:14.525
and now you want me to
make love to him on camera?

10:14.527 --> 10:16.093
I mean, I have six
International Emmys,

10:16.095 --> 10:18.095
but even I can't act that well.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.767
Ana,

10:22.769 --> 10:25.503
you are incredibly valuable
to this network.

10:25.505 --> 10:27.171
- I will take care of it.
- Well,

10:27.173 --> 10:31.075
the sooner the better.

10:31.077 --> 10:32.476
- Of course.
- Yeah.

10:39.452 --> 10:41.419
You just need to--

10:41.421 --> 10:42.820
It's more of a--

- Nothing.

I just told the
network president I'd rather

11:45.618 --> 11:47.952
French kiss Isabela than
do a love scene with you.

11:47.954 --> 11:49.620
- Ana!
- What?

11:49.622 --> 11:50.788
Page 22.

11:52.859 --> 11:55.559
It's too much Spanish.
I can't read that fast.

11:55.561 --> 11:56.761

11:56.763 --> 11:58.763
Mom!

12:00.500 --> 12:02.099
Isn't this exciting?

12:02.101 --> 12:04.034
I mean, you've always been
like a mother to me,

12:04.036 --> 12:05.936
and now you really are!

12:05.938 --> 12:07.538
You got your wish.

12:07.540 --> 12:09.039
You're not playing
my love interest anymore.

12:09.041 --> 12:10.474
You're playing
my love interest's mom.

12:10.476 --> 12:12.042
Ay, yay!

12:12.044 --> 12:13.744
- What is happening?
- I don't know.

12:13.746 --> 12:17.548
I guess they'll have to change
the poster... again.

12:17.550 --> 12:20.251
Okay, wait, um...

12:20.253 --> 12:23.320

You don't have a turtle--

12:29.962 --> 12:31.328

- Okay! That's okay!

12:31.330 --> 12:32.663
That's okay!
I gotta go outside.

12:32.665 --> 12:35.399
I'm gonna go outside.
Oh, okay!

12:35.401 --> 12:38.002
Oh.

12:38.004 --> 12:39.737

to be Enrique Iglesias!

You know he still won't admit

13:28.515 --> 13:29.947
And I'm here suffering
while he's off

13:29.949 --> 13:31.816
partying on his dumb boat,

13:31.818 --> 13:33.451
a boat he doesn't deserve.

13:33.453 --> 13:35.720

to steal somebody's
private property.

13:46.366 --> 13:48.432

What if we go to jail?

This is crazy.

15:30.803 --> 15:33.070
I'm crazy.

15:33.072 --> 15:35.006
I've been blaming you for
everything wrong in my life,

15:35.008 --> 15:38.009
and clearly it's
my fault.

15:38.011 --> 15:41.345

Come again?

15:45.385 --> 15:48.185
I said I'm sorry, Ana.

15:48.187 --> 15:51.589
I never slept with Shakira,

15:51.591 --> 15:53.891
but I did sleep
with her cousin,

15:53.893 --> 15:57.294
and you were right,
I cheated on you.

15:57.296 --> 15:58.629
Yes!

15:58.631 --> 16:01.265
Yes! Yes!
Yes, yes, yes!

16:01.267 --> 16:02.833

I was expecting.

16:02.835 --> 16:04.368
I'm not crazy!

16:04.370 --> 16:07.171
I knew you cheated.
I just couldn't prove it.

16:07.173 --> 16:09.240
But now it is official.

16:09.242 --> 16:12.343
You cheated on me!

16:12.345 --> 16:14.311
Oh, my God.

16:14.313 --> 16:17.181
- You cheated on me.
- My bad.

16:17.183 --> 16:19.183
Well, why did you wait
three years to tell me?

16:19.185 --> 16:20.818
Maybe we could've
fixed it.

16:20.820 --> 16:22.887
I know.

16:22.889 --> 16:25.156
And if it's
any consolation, Ana,

16:25.158 --> 16:26.991
I really loved you.

16:29.162 --> 16:31.128
I loved you too.

16:36.235 --> 16:38.869
You know, it might've been fun
to play love interests again.

16:38.871 --> 16:42.640
Oh, yeah, well,
that'll never happen.

16:42.642 --> 16:44.075
Now that my breakdown
went viral,

16:44.077 --> 16:46.677
no one will ever see me
as a leading lady.

16:46.679 --> 16:47.978

aren't here now

this nice moment.

16:50.216 --> 16:52.450

the people what they want,

18:37.290 --> 18:40.090
"Guapa." Beautiful.

18:40.092 --> 18:41.392
He's not the only one.

18:41.394 --> 18:43.794
This kiss looked real to me.

Oh, you guys.

18:45.498 --> 18:47.898
Look, I don't love
that Xavi cheated,

18:47.900 --> 18:49.433
but once he finally
admitted it,

18:49.435 --> 18:51.869
I felt like we could
move past it.

18:51.871 --> 18:53.437
I mean, come on, Xavi is
the hottest guy I know.

18:53.439 --> 18:55.472
I mean,
those eyes?

18:55.474 --> 18:57.208
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

19:00.179 --> 19:01.812
They need you on set.

19:01.814 --> 19:03.747
<i>♪ uh huh, you see me</i>
<i>in the spotlight ♪</i>

19:03.749 --> 19:06.250

19:06.252 --> 19:08.219

19:12.692 --> 19:15.459
<i>♪ baby, I'm worth it</i>
<i>Uh huh, I'm worth it ♪</i>

19:15.461 --> 19:16.827
Great job on the script!

19:16.829 --> 19:18.095
When Pasión finds out
her real father--

19:18.097 --> 19:19.763
No spoilers, no spoilers,
no spoilers.

19:19.765 --> 19:22.066
- But you wrote it.
- La, la, la, la, la.

19:22.068 --> 19:24.068
<i>♪ baby, I'm worth it ♪</i>

19:24.070 --> 19:26.470
Uh.

19:26.472 --> 19:29.440

<i>I'm worth it ♪</i>

19:29.442 --> 19:31.429

19:32.278 --> 19:33.544
I don't understand.

19:33.546 --> 19:35.179
Oh, thank you.

19:35.181 --> 19:36.747
- Paulo?
- Yeah.

19:36.749 --> 19:38.782
Yes!

19:38.784 --> 19:40.951
Wait, wait, wait!

19:42.488 --> 19:44.588
Girl, that must have been
one hell of a kiss.

19:44.590 --> 19:46.290
It kind of was!

19:46.292 --> 19:47.925
I don't know,
maybe deep down inside

19:47.927 --> 19:50.527
I knew there was
still something between us.

19:56.869 --> 20:00.971
Tell me that is a sister I've
never seen, met, or heard about.

20:00.973 --> 20:03.173
That is not a sister.

20:03.175 --> 20:04.475
Places!

20:10.016 --> 20:11.115
Action!

20:11.379 --> 20:13.226
