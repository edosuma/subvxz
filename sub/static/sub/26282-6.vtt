WEBVTT

00:01.035 --> 00:02.570
Scrub in with The Resident.

00:02.603 --> 00:04.638
This is a business.
It's not a charity.

00:04.672 --> 00:06.574
Catch all-new episodes Mondays,

00:06.607 --> 00:08.542
and check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.576 --> 00:11.912
9-1-1, Lethal Weapon,
and Empire.

00:11.945 --> 00:14.248
We lost Empire,
but we are still here.

00:14.282 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.853
-Previously on The Resident...
-Tell me about your mom.

00:19.887 --> 00:22.690
-Nic.
-Mom or dad, you pick.

00:22.723 --> 00:25.426
Parents split, my dad
kept me from my mom.

00:25.459 --> 00:27.361
And then she passed away,
you know that.

00:27.395 --> 00:29.330
BELL:
The love of my life
turned out to be

00:29.363 --> 00:31.632
a psychopathic doctor
who poisoned her own patients.

00:33.767 --> 00:35.703
Oh, come on, Bell,
we all know

00:35.736 --> 00:37.138
you're the most eligible
bachelor.

00:38.439 --> 00:40.108
-Jessie.
-I screwed up.

00:42.110 --> 00:43.677
My sister. She OD'd on oxy.

00:43.711 --> 00:47.115
-She could've died.
-Eight months clean.

00:47.148 --> 00:49.583
Happiest I've been in forever.

00:49.617 --> 00:52.286
Just like that
I threw it all away.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.188
We got to get you better
for good this time.

00:54.222 --> 00:56.290
Whatever it takes.

00:56.324 --> 00:58.392
:
I'm such a liability.

01:26.854 --> 01:28.622
KIDS:
Trick or treat!

02:02.456 --> 02:04.792
KID'S VOICE:
Trick or treat.

02:22.810 --> 02:25.313
KID'S VOICE:
Trick or treat.

02:40.928 --> 02:42.830
Oh, please.

02:48.101 --> 02:49.237
Aah!

02:52.706 --> 02:53.874
Oh... oh, God.

02:56.277 --> 02:58.579
No!

03:04.918 --> 03:06.186
No!

03:06.220 --> 03:08.422
-No, no!
-She's having an episode.

03:09.390 --> 03:10.658
What's her name?

03:10.691 --> 03:12.726
Laurie Dante.

03:12.760 --> 03:15.195
-DEVON: Laurie, you're okay.

03:15.229 --> 03:17.030
Two of Lorazepam I-M
for sedation. Go, go.

03:17.064 --> 03:18.832
HUNDLEY:
She must have dozed off.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.768
She said she hadn't slept
in days.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.169
:
Oh, make them stop.
-All right, Laurie,

03:22.202 --> 03:24.238
Laurie.
You're okay. You're safe.

03:28.609 --> 03:30.444
Hey. Laurie.

03:30.478 --> 03:32.212
You're in the hospital.

03:32.246 --> 03:33.481
We'll take care of you, okay?

03:38.886 --> 03:40.621
Let's admit her
to the fifth floor.

03:40.654 --> 03:42.656
-And page Conrad, stat.
-Okay.

03:48.929 --> 03:50.931
*

04:02.776 --> 04:05.546
Guess what this is?

04:05.579 --> 04:07.415
I know what that is.

04:07.448 --> 04:09.116
Yeah, but have you ever
tasted it--

04:09.149 --> 04:10.918
the chocolate, caramel, nougat?

04:10.951 --> 04:13.787
You're hilarious.

04:13.821 --> 04:15.323
Let's break some rules,
Conrad Hawkins.

04:15.356 --> 04:17.291
-After all, it is Halloween.
-Mmm.

04:17.325 --> 04:18.659
I'm listening.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.594
Get a resident to cover for you.

04:20.628 --> 04:22.229
Pick a costume.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.766
I'm thinking something from
the Marvel universe.

04:25.799 --> 04:27.601
Come to Mina's party.

04:27.635 --> 04:29.470
And I can't believe
I'm gonna say this,

04:29.503 --> 04:32.072
but eat a bunch of candy
with me.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.842
That sounds scary.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.243
And amazing.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.145
I wish I could,

04:38.178 --> 04:40.147
-but I can't.
-Mm.

04:40.180 --> 04:42.683
We're understaffed.
It's Halloween night.

04:42.716 --> 04:44.117
You know how crazy it can get.

04:44.151 --> 04:46.487
-My dad.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.456
I was supposed to meet him
before work 45 minutes ago.

04:48.489 --> 04:51.024
That's strange.
Maybe he forgot.

04:51.058 --> 04:53.494
Yeah. Very strange.
He never forgets. Anything.

04:54.495 --> 04:55.863
Go.

04:55.896 --> 04:56.964
Get out of here.

04:56.997 --> 04:58.098
Have enough fun for both of us.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.401
Oh, I plan on it.

05:03.236 --> 05:04.972
Happy Halloween.

05:11.078 --> 05:12.646
I admitted Laurie Dante.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.114
Nightmare girl with
the psychotic breaks?

05:14.147 --> 05:15.215
Yep.

05:15.248 --> 05:16.484
How is she?

05:16.517 --> 05:17.885
Oh, she's scared.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.186
Conrad's on his way.

05:19.219 --> 05:20.688
Good. I'm off for the night.

05:20.721 --> 05:22.222
The place is all yours.

05:22.255 --> 05:24.291
First Halloween in the ER.
Enjoy.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.292
What are these?

05:25.325 --> 05:27.561
Costumes. For Mina's party.

05:27.595 --> 05:29.663
I have backups on hand

05:29.697 --> 05:32.065
because Mina must approve before
she lets you in the door.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.333
Last year I got rejected.

05:33.367 --> 05:35.569
Twice. But not this year, baby.

05:35.603 --> 05:37.237
This year, I'm money.

05:37.270 --> 05:38.506
What are you gonna be?

05:38.539 --> 05:40.541
Werewolf.

05:40.574 --> 05:42.710
Good luck, buddy.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.580
Concussion. Needs observation
for another four hours.

05:46.614 --> 05:48.181
I got it.

05:48.215 --> 05:50.217
Vampire in two should have stuck
to drinking blood.

05:50.250 --> 05:51.919
Hang two liters of saline
and discharge

05:51.952 --> 05:53.554
when he can count backwards
from ten.

05:53.587 --> 05:55.556
You suck for taking tonight off
and leaving me here

05:55.589 --> 05:58.325
with the most juvenile
med student in history.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.861
I can't argue with you on that
one, but here's the good news:

06:00.894 --> 06:03.564
Halloween is a notoriously
slow night in the ER.

06:03.597 --> 06:05.566
You're a terrible liar.
Now leave, please.

06:05.599 --> 06:06.900
PARAMEDIC:
Hey, right arm for reattachment.

06:06.934 --> 06:09.069
Patient is still
trapped in his vehicle.

06:09.102 --> 06:11.238
We have to get back to scene.
Dr. Feldman has the details.

06:11.271 --> 06:13.941
-Thank you.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.275
The call might have come in
about 15 minutes ago.

06:15.308 --> 06:16.510
I thought it would be
a fun surprise.

06:16.544 --> 06:19.246
You know, trick or treat?

06:19.279 --> 06:20.848
Let's get this arm on ice.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.282
Hold down the fort, Pravesh.

06:22.315 --> 06:24.918
Keep that arm viable
for reattachment.

06:24.952 --> 06:28.188
Hmm. Girlfriends?

06:28.221 --> 06:30.123
They're cool.
I got one myself.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.293
Isn't that your name?

06:33.326 --> 06:36.664
Yeah. What?

06:38.398 --> 06:41.068
I cannot believe that you made
these by yourself.

06:41.101 --> 06:42.302
Well, when you don't leave
the house very often,

06:42.335 --> 06:44.237
you look for things to do.

06:44.271 --> 06:46.073
How long has it been?

06:46.106 --> 06:48.041
Since I've had a wild night out

06:48.075 --> 06:49.910
or since I got sober?

06:49.943 --> 06:51.445
I'm kidding.

06:51.479 --> 06:52.880
Four weeks rehab.

06:52.913 --> 06:55.115
Two weeks sober living.

06:55.148 --> 06:56.650
One week on your couch.

06:56.684 --> 06:59.086
-Well, I am proud of you.
-Thank you.

06:59.119 --> 07:01.154
And thanks for inviting me
tonight. I'm really excited.

07:01.188 --> 07:03.123
Are you kidding me?
The costume's at Mina's

07:03.156 --> 07:05.258
Halloween parties are legendary.

07:05.292 --> 07:08.061
Everybody should experience it
at least once.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.464
Well, I know you're worried
about me staying

07:10.498 --> 07:12.165
son the straight and narrow,
but I just want to say,

07:12.199 --> 07:14.067
I'm not just doing this
for me anymore,

07:14.101 --> 07:15.603
I'm staying clean
for both of us. Okay?

07:15.636 --> 07:18.939
I'm not worried.
Do I look worried?

07:18.972 --> 07:21.509
Yeah, you have like a resting
worried face.

07:26.547 --> 07:29.483
Laurie, I'm Dr. Conrad Hawkins.

07:31.318 --> 07:32.853
I'm here to help, okay?

07:35.322 --> 07:37.124
I'm really sorry.

07:37.157 --> 07:40.928
This is embarrassing, actually.
I-I just have bad dreams.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.930
You have people
who need you. I...

07:42.963 --> 07:45.032
I'm not even sure I should have
come in. I'm-I'm fine.

07:45.065 --> 07:47.034
Laurie, I'm happy you're here,

07:47.067 --> 07:48.769
because I'd like to make sure
it's nothing serious.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.171
Sound like a plan?

07:51.204 --> 07:52.973
All right, tell me--

07:53.006 --> 07:56.443
when'd you start
having these episodes?

07:56.476 --> 07:58.546
Uh, couple weeks ago.

07:58.579 --> 08:01.381
I figured they'd just go away,
but they keep happening.

08:01.414 --> 08:02.950
Getting more intense.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.284
Now...

08:04.317 --> 08:07.988
I'm afraid to fall asleep.

08:08.021 --> 08:09.790
Go ahead--

08:09.823 --> 08:11.792
tell me to go home, that
there's nothing wrong with me.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.061
It's exactly what the other
three doctors said.

08:14.094 --> 08:16.196
Actually, women under 35 are
the most misdiagnosed subset

08:16.229 --> 08:18.331
of patients in the country,
so, no,

08:18.365 --> 08:20.133
I don't want to tell you that.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.636
Whatever you're experiencing
is taking a toll on you.

08:22.670 --> 08:24.404
That's very clear.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.475
Dang it.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.243
I'm sorry.

08:30.277 --> 08:33.513
Sorry, I don't know
why I'm crying.

08:33.547 --> 08:35.849
Because you're scared.

08:39.920 --> 08:43.557
Laurie, just tell me everything.

08:43.591 --> 08:44.858
Where you work.
The medications you're on.

08:44.892 --> 08:46.493
Don't leave anything out.

08:46.526 --> 08:49.329
The smallest of things
can lead me to a diagnosis.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.832
No meds.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.701
I don't have a regular job.

08:53.734 --> 08:57.237
I... nanny for a family
in Inman Park.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.272
-There's nothing wrong
with that.
-Says you.

08:59.306 --> 09:02.042
My family hates
the whole idea.

09:02.075 --> 09:04.778
We have a farm
near Statesboro.

09:04.812 --> 09:06.614
They didn't want me
moving to Atlanta.

09:06.647 --> 09:09.182
They think I'm gonna get into
trouble in the big city.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.218
We don't talk much anymore.

09:13.921 --> 09:17.591
Actually, we don't talk at all.

09:17.625 --> 09:20.260
That sounds difficult. That must
put a lot of stress on you.

09:20.293 --> 09:21.528
They're wrong.

09:21.561 --> 09:24.064
I can handle it.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.767
I'm gonna run some tests--
blood panel,

09:26.800 --> 09:28.902
lumbar puncture, MRI.

09:28.936 --> 09:30.671
We're gonna get to the bottom
of this together.

09:36.910 --> 09:40.213
What would cause a website
not to load on my computer?

09:40.247 --> 09:43.116
Uh, the hospital server
blocks porn.

09:43.150 --> 09:45.619
I'm the CEO of the hospital.

09:45.653 --> 09:47.154
I don't look at porn.

09:47.187 --> 09:48.756
Everyone looks at porn.

09:48.789 --> 09:50.123
I'm not watching porn.

09:50.157 --> 09:51.324
Right, 'cause it's blocked.

09:51.358 --> 09:54.561
Remind me why I hired you?

09:54.594 --> 09:56.296
Uh, 'cause your
last assistant quit

09:56.329 --> 09:57.798
and my dad is Zip Betournay.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.667
He owns the Crystal Springs
Golf Club.

09:59.700 --> 10:00.834
Pretty sure he jumped you
to the top

10:00.868 --> 10:01.935
of the wait-list to get in.

10:01.969 --> 10:03.570
That was rhetorical.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.572
Oh.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.690
There is nothing abnormal,
is there?

10:22.723 --> 10:24.524
Radiologist will have to give
the final read,

10:24.557 --> 10:26.293
-but it looks that way.

10:31.799 --> 10:35.035
-Have transpo
take her to her room.
-Okay.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.005
Dad.

10:38.038 --> 10:39.840
MARSHALL :
I'm sorry I missed you earlier.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.875
I had some business
to attend to.

10:41.909 --> 10:43.610
At 9:00 at night?

10:43.643 --> 10:46.213
Can I make it up to you?
I'll swing by Chastain later.

10:46.246 --> 10:47.715
I'm on a shift.

10:47.748 --> 10:48.882
Could be a long one.

10:48.916 --> 10:50.350
Of course.

10:50.383 --> 10:52.019
I understand.

10:52.052 --> 10:54.554
-It's gonna be okay.

10:54.587 --> 10:56.156
-Let me out of here.
-I got to go.
-I'll find you.

10:56.189 --> 10:57.691
I'm gonna take you
to your room, okay?

10:57.725 --> 10:59.292
No, t-take me out
of this building!

10:59.326 --> 11:00.794
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what's the problem?

11:00.828 --> 11:02.295
She wants to get discharged.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.164
You can't keep me here
against my will.

11:04.197 --> 11:06.399
Laurie, we talked about this.
I need to run some more tests

11:06.433 --> 11:07.968
so we can figure out
what's wrong.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.837
Who are you?

11:09.870 --> 11:12.539
I'm your doctor.

11:12.572 --> 11:14.207
No.

11:14.241 --> 11:16.209
My doctor is Conrad Hawkins.

11:16.243 --> 11:18.378
I just talked to him.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.916
I've never met you before
in my life.

11:32.425 --> 11:35.662
Pravesh, I got a page
about a reattachment surgery--

11:35.695 --> 11:38.665
a delicate operation
that demands my unique skills.

11:38.698 --> 11:39.833
Where's the arm?

11:39.867 --> 11:41.835
I'm keeping it cool on ice.

11:41.869 --> 11:44.571
Good. I'll start
its admission process.

11:44.604 --> 11:46.339
But you can't admit an arm.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.241
It's not alive.
It doesn't have insurance.

11:48.275 --> 11:49.576
Doesn't have a name.

11:49.609 --> 11:52.212
Okay, I'll give it a name.
Clyde.

11:52.245 --> 11:54.247
Clyde?
That's the best you can do?

11:54.281 --> 11:55.916
Well, it's uninspired,
but whatever.

11:55.949 --> 11:57.684
When I reattach Clyde
to the patient,

11:57.717 --> 12:00.187
it will be both alive
and insured.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.955
All right.

12:06.426 --> 12:07.660
I don't know who did that.

12:10.663 --> 12:12.632
It wasn't me.

12:12.665 --> 12:14.802
Relax.
Clyde has a sense of humor.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.770
I approve.

12:18.005 --> 12:19.272
NIC:
Okay.

12:25.012 --> 12:27.314
-* Bring it back now, baby *
-NIC: Wow.

12:27.347 --> 12:29.883
-You look amazing.
-Oh, thank you.

12:29.917 --> 12:33.320
And you look...

12:33.353 --> 12:34.788
homemade.

12:34.822 --> 12:37.224
That's a good thing, right?

12:37.257 --> 12:39.092
-She's very hard to read.
-Yeah.

12:39.126 --> 12:41.661
Uh, A-minus.

12:41.694 --> 12:43.630
-B-minus for effort.

12:43.663 --> 12:46.466
Plus, I like you both.
You may enter.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.501
* Bring it back now, babe *

12:48.535 --> 12:50.003
* I hate when I have
to watch you go *

12:50.037 --> 12:51.504
* Oh, Lord, I love *

12:51.538 --> 12:53.240
-* To watch you leave, I want *
-Roar!

12:53.273 --> 12:54.507
-* Your hands all over me *
-No.

12:54.541 --> 12:56.643
* Won't you bring it back? *

12:56.676 --> 12:59.146
Damn it.

12:59.179 --> 13:01.148
* Bring it back now, baby *

13:01.181 --> 13:03.416
* Bring it back now,
babe *

13:03.450 --> 13:05.418
* Bring it back now, baby *

13:05.452 --> 13:07.988
* Bring it back now,
babe *

13:08.021 --> 13:09.823
* Bring it back now, baby *

13:09.857 --> 13:12.492
* Bring it back now,
babe *

13:12.525 --> 13:14.261
* Bring it back now, baby *

13:14.294 --> 13:16.329
Oh.

13:18.365 --> 13:21.401
Hello. I'm a sucker
for a man in leopard skin.

13:22.469 --> 13:23.971
You know, for a bunch of doctors

13:24.004 --> 13:25.705
and nurses, I thought
this party would be...

13:25.738 --> 13:27.107
-No offense.

13:27.140 --> 13:30.677
No, nothing I do is tame.

13:30.710 --> 13:34.114
The prescription drugs
that you have for your clinic--

13:34.147 --> 13:36.183
are they
in the apartment tonight?

13:36.216 --> 13:38.551
Please give me some credit.
I'm not a fool.

13:41.922 --> 13:45.358
Perhaps you should
let go of Kitty's leash.

13:45.392 --> 13:47.560
* Bring it back now, baby *

13:47.594 --> 13:49.596
* Bring it back now, babe. *

13:53.233 --> 13:56.569
If you really are Dr. Hawkins,
why can't I recognize you?

13:56.603 --> 13:58.906
It's called Capgras syndrome.
It's very rare.

13:58.939 --> 14:01.741
People see a familiar face, but
the emotional charge necessary

14:01.774 --> 14:03.410
for recognition is lost.

14:03.443 --> 14:05.312
It's lost because the area
in the brain

14:05.345 --> 14:07.714
that controls emotions has
some sort of disconnect there.

14:07.747 --> 14:09.716
And that disconnect
is telling you

14:09.749 --> 14:12.052
that you are seeing an imposter
when you really aren't.

14:12.085 --> 14:13.753
But why is it happening?

14:13.786 --> 14:16.756
There's a number
of possible causes.

14:16.789 --> 14:20.593
Earlier, you told me
not to hold back.

14:20.627 --> 14:22.362
So you do the same.

14:22.395 --> 14:23.964
Just tell me the truth.

14:30.603 --> 14:33.773
Do you have any family history
of schizophrenia?

14:35.943 --> 14:38.745
Oh, God.

14:38.778 --> 14:40.280
My cousin was schizophrenic.

14:40.313 --> 14:41.714
H-He heard voices.
He couldn't take it.

14:41.748 --> 14:43.416
He jumped off
the Jackson Street Bridge

14:43.450 --> 14:45.518
-two years ago.
-Slow down. Hey, hey, hey.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.921
There is a lot of ground
to cover between where we are

14:47.955 --> 14:49.689
right now and diagnosing
what's really going on.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.891
I've paged a neurologist.

14:51.925 --> 14:53.560
He will be here very soon,

14:53.593 --> 14:56.129
and he will walk us
through everything.

15:04.004 --> 15:06.106
What a noob.

15:09.676 --> 15:12.879
Lag. Lag. Why is it lagging?
Okay...

15:12.912 --> 15:15.715
-Clear out your desk.

15:15.748 --> 15:18.618
-It's your first and last day.

15:18.651 --> 15:21.588
Wait, no, are... R

15:21.621 --> 15:23.156
This is called a job.

15:23.190 --> 15:24.992
You may not be familiar
with jobs.

15:25.025 --> 15:26.759
They usually entail work.

15:26.793 --> 15:28.795
You've done no work.

15:28.828 --> 15:29.997
You can break the news
to your dad.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.431
I'll find myself a new club.

15:31.464 --> 15:33.967
I get fired, he kills me.
For real.

15:34.001 --> 15:35.735
Well, that's something for you
to consider in your next job.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.737
If you ever get one.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.107
I can hook you up.

15:41.374 --> 15:42.342
-I've seen you

15:42.375 --> 15:43.810
swiping right all day.

15:43.843 --> 15:47.514
I can find you
a smoking hot date, tonight.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.116
Have you lost your mind?

15:49.149 --> 15:50.450
Look, just hear me out.

15:50.483 --> 15:51.918
I match people together, okay?

15:51.951 --> 15:53.520
It's a thing I do.
I have no skills

15:53.553 --> 15:55.188
in life whatsoever
except for my ability

15:55.222 --> 15:56.689
to put man and woman together.

15:56.723 --> 15:58.691
Sometimes man and man,
sometimes lady and lady.

15:58.725 --> 15:59.959
All types. Last-minute.

15:59.993 --> 16:01.628
Short-term, long-term, whatever.

16:01.661 --> 16:03.096
It's a gift that I have,
and it's a gift

16:03.130 --> 16:05.632
that I can give to you tonight.

16:05.665 --> 16:08.535
This is painfully inappropriate.

16:08.568 --> 16:09.802
Or it's delightfully perfect.

16:09.836 --> 16:12.039
Okay?
I-I have someone in mind.

16:21.714 --> 16:24.284
Capgras, huh?
Ah, that's a tough one.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.952
I have a few tests we should do.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.621
Rule out the possibility
of biological causes.

16:28.655 --> 16:31.858
Where's my patient?

16:31.891 --> 16:32.859
Laurie.

16:32.892 --> 16:34.194
Uh, she wanted to grab some air.

16:36.163 --> 16:38.965
Uh, did I do something wrong?

16:38.998 --> 16:41.000
*

16:58.017 --> 16:59.419
Laurie?

17:01.854 --> 17:04.424
Laurie?

17:08.928 --> 17:11.464
I'm never gonna be normal
again, am I?

17:15.034 --> 17:17.837
We don't know that.

17:17.870 --> 17:20.006
We only just started
doing tests.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.942
Let's give it some time.

17:23.943 --> 17:26.779
I don't know if I can.

17:26.813 --> 17:29.449
I'll be there with you
every step of the way.

17:29.482 --> 17:30.817
We'll do this.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.587
We'll do this together.

17:55.508 --> 17:59.479
-You're gonna be fine.
Hang in there.
-Mm-hmm, yeah.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.390
Okay, who did this?

18:10.423 --> 18:12.992
Wow.

18:13.025 --> 18:14.827
-No, it's not funny.
-Yeah, but don't look at me.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.463
The Raptor does not prank.

18:16.496 --> 18:19.098
-Although he appreciates pranks.

18:25.372 --> 18:26.906
A man lost his arm.

18:26.939 --> 18:29.509
And he could very well be dying,
for all we know.

18:29.542 --> 18:31.611
Still seem funny to you?
Is this why

18:31.644 --> 18:33.146
you wanted to become a doctor?

18:33.180 --> 18:34.581
Chill, Pravesh.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.416
I'll reattach Clyde the Arm

18:36.449 --> 18:40.320
to the living body it belongs to
as soon as it gets to Chastain.

18:40.353 --> 18:43.022
Incoming!
Left leg. Same patient.

18:43.055 --> 18:45.825
Patient is still trapped
at scene. 20 minute ETA.

18:48.828 --> 18:51.097
We're gonna need more surgeons.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.600
* I'm looking
for some good conversation *

18:53.633 --> 18:56.669
* Looking
for a little inspiration *

18:56.703 --> 18:58.705
* 'Cause you won't catch me out,
catch me out often *

18:58.738 --> 19:01.841
* But tonight I'm all about
participation, mm *

19:01.874 --> 19:04.143
* If you ain't makin' moves
then I'm off it *

19:04.177 --> 19:05.144
* Particular when it comes
to involvement *

19:05.178 --> 19:06.479
You're being codependent.

19:06.513 --> 19:08.681
How 'bout "Great party.
You having a good time?"

19:08.715 --> 19:11.984
I don't ask questions
I already know the answers to.

19:14.521 --> 19:18.325
* I'm-a work myself to death
if no one stop me *

19:18.358 --> 19:19.692
Emergency surgery.

19:19.726 --> 19:22.329
I have to go back to Chastain.

19:22.362 --> 19:23.463
Okay, you're in charge now.

19:23.496 --> 19:24.697
-Three things:

19:24.731 --> 19:26.499
one, don't let anyone throw up
on my rug;

19:26.533 --> 19:29.869
two, don't let Irving in
without a better costume;

19:29.902 --> 19:32.138
and, three, you can have
the weight of the world

19:32.171 --> 19:35.742
on your shoulders at Chastain
but not in my apartment.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.477
Not tonight.

19:37.510 --> 19:40.747
* I'm-a work myself to death
if no one stop me *

19:52.925 --> 19:54.327
All right.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.329
How about you fill in
all the numbers

19:56.363 --> 19:58.898
on this clock for me?

20:19.319 --> 20:21.621
CONRAD:
The fact that you drew
all the numbers

20:21.654 --> 20:23.222
on one side of the clock means

20:23.256 --> 20:24.891
that there's a biological basis
for your illness.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.893
This is actually good news.

20:26.926 --> 20:29.529
-Exactly. The test

20:29.562 --> 20:31.230
shows us that only
one half of your brain

20:31.264 --> 20:33.232
seems to be interacting
with the outside world.

20:33.266 --> 20:35.201
You don't know
what's causing it yet?

20:35.234 --> 20:37.437
No. There's still
something going on

20:37.470 --> 20:38.771
that our tests
didn't pick up yet.

20:38.805 --> 20:40.607
-Inflammation.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.975
Autoimmune diseases.
Toxins.

20:43.009 --> 20:44.744
I want to keep you
in the hospital overnight.

20:44.777 --> 20:46.646
We're gonna order an EEG,

20:46.679 --> 20:48.147
start you on empiric antibiotics

20:48.180 --> 20:50.082
to treat for possible
infectious causes.

20:50.116 --> 20:52.285
I keep thinking--

20:52.319 --> 20:53.986
I brought this on myself.

20:54.020 --> 20:57.424
I-I walked away from my family.

20:57.457 --> 20:59.826
Maybe it's karma or something.

20:59.859 --> 21:01.828
Had I never left,
maybe none of this would be

21:01.861 --> 21:04.497
happening to me.
I-I deserve the nightmares.

21:04.531 --> 21:07.500
Everyone gets nightmares.

21:07.534 --> 21:10.770
:
I get my own from time to time.

21:10.803 --> 21:14.341
You didn't bring this
upon yourself.

21:14.374 --> 21:17.076
We're gonna give you
a sedative through your IV.

21:17.109 --> 21:20.947
Should help you get
a good night's rest.

21:27.219 --> 21:29.188
Whatever's happening
in her brain,

21:29.221 --> 21:31.123
it's progressing quickly.

21:31.157 --> 21:33.693
We need to find
the source fast

21:33.726 --> 21:35.161
to avoid any permanent damage.

21:35.194 --> 21:36.529
Check her in an hour.
If she needs more meds,

21:36.563 --> 21:38.230
we'll do it then.

21:39.332 --> 21:41.133
She gonna be okay?

21:41.167 --> 21:42.969
Diagnosis is a needle
in a haystack.

21:43.002 --> 21:44.704
But I'll keep looking
till I find it.

21:44.737 --> 21:46.205
You seem tired.

21:46.238 --> 21:47.874
You sleeping much?

21:47.907 --> 21:50.309
Residents don't get to sleep.

21:50.343 --> 21:54.213
Son, when was the last time
you took just a few days off

21:54.246 --> 21:56.883
to recharge your batteries?

21:56.916 --> 21:58.485
I have no idea.

21:58.518 --> 22:00.820
I did the same thing
when I was your age.

22:00.853 --> 22:03.222
Burned it at both ends
until I burned out.

22:03.255 --> 22:04.657
You going somewhere with this?

22:04.691 --> 22:08.661
I'd like to go somewhere
together.

22:08.695 --> 22:10.363
You and me.

22:10.397 --> 22:13.466
I have a place in Anguilla.

22:13.500 --> 22:14.801
Condo by the beach.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.536
We could fly out
for a long weekend.

22:16.569 --> 22:18.638
Why didn't you show up
for coffee tonight?

22:18.671 --> 22:21.340
I told you,
I had business crosstown.

22:21.374 --> 22:23.042
Do you want to try
that explanation again?

22:23.075 --> 22:24.844
Because I have never known you
to miss an appointment.

22:37.356 --> 22:39.892
Riley, sweetie,
watch your sisters, okay?

22:39.926 --> 22:42.529
Where's my husband?

22:42.562 --> 22:44.030
Frank Tanner.

22:44.063 --> 22:46.198
-Uh, he was in a car accident.
-The tattoos.

22:46.232 --> 22:48.701
Riley, Gemma, Eve.

22:48.735 --> 22:50.102
Not lovers. Children.

22:50.136 --> 22:52.539
And I just got word:
Frank is one minute out.

22:52.572 --> 22:54.574
All right, I'll move them
to the waiting room.

22:54.607 --> 22:57.076
Ms. Tanner,
I'm Dr. Devon Pravesh.

22:57.109 --> 22:59.178
Come with me.
Your husband hasn't

22:59.211 --> 23:00.780
made it to the ER yet,
but the moment he does,

23:00.813 --> 23:02.381
we'll take care of him, okay?
Just wait there.

23:02.415 --> 23:04.250
-Okay. Girls.
-Guys, come on.

23:04.283 --> 23:08.020
PARAMEDIC:
46-year-old male.
Prolonged extrication.

23:08.054 --> 23:09.522
-Oh, my God, Frank!
-Suffered amputation
of his arm and leg.

23:09.556 --> 23:11.257
-Oh, my God!
-Multiple liters
of blood loss on scene.

23:11.290 --> 23:13.726
-HUNDLEY: Ten.
-Frank!
-Wait here.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.630
Okay.

23:17.664 --> 23:20.032
One, two, three.

23:20.066 --> 23:21.534
Get me cordis.

23:21.568 --> 23:22.935
Call out vitals.

23:22.969 --> 23:25.572
70/40. Pulse is 50 and falling.

23:25.605 --> 23:27.607
-Hey, he's about to code.
-I know.

23:27.640 --> 23:30.477
Start a rapid transfuser.
Hang two units of O neg now.

23:30.510 --> 23:32.579
-Heart rate dropping. 30.

23:33.245 --> 23:34.814
All right.

23:37.316 --> 23:39.952
One of epinephrine.
Get me the pacer pads.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.255
Heart rate at 20.

23:46.793 --> 23:48.127
Ten.

23:49.496 --> 23:51.464
Zero. All right,
somebody better start pumping.

23:51.498 --> 23:53.966
Let me do it. I can do this.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.434
Okay.

24:03.876 --> 24:07.246
Hold compressions. Check pulses.

24:07.279 --> 24:08.414
-Nothing.
-AUSTIN: Come on, Pravesh.

24:08.447 --> 24:09.849
Frank dies, I've got nobody

24:09.882 --> 24:11.283
to operate on tonight.

24:11.317 --> 24:13.553
Is he breathing?

24:18.491 --> 24:19.826
Shock him.

24:19.859 --> 24:21.327
HUNDLEY:
Charging.

24:21.360 --> 24:23.696
Clear.

24:28.367 --> 24:31.337
Nice. Frank lives.

24:31.370 --> 24:33.205
For now.
Send him for a pan-scan.

24:33.239 --> 24:36.242
OR Numero Uno is where I'll be.

24:39.679 --> 24:42.815
-* Why not take me away... *
-NIC: Hey. Hey!

24:42.849 --> 24:45.952
-Stop that. I mean...
Oh, my God, I...
-IRVING: Nic.

24:45.985 --> 24:48.387
My hero.
Thanks for letting me in.

24:48.420 --> 24:49.956
This party is epic.

24:49.989 --> 24:51.524
Is it, though?

24:51.558 --> 24:53.459
IRVING:
Uh, hello?

24:53.492 --> 24:56.195
There's a 40% chance
I'm making out with Bo-Peep.

24:56.228 --> 24:59.331
Uh, actually there's
a 100% chance that Bo-Peep

24:59.365 --> 25:02.669
-is making out with Hercules.
-IRVING: Oh.

25:02.702 --> 25:05.371
She'll come around.

25:05.404 --> 25:07.239
You okay?

25:07.273 --> 25:10.409
I will be once I find Jessie.
She's MIA.

25:10.442 --> 25:13.746
Check the closets.
Lots of activity in the closets.

25:15.014 --> 25:18.685
* Why not, why not *

25:18.718 --> 25:22.221
* Why not,
why not *

25:22.254 --> 25:24.156
* Why not,
what you got to lose *

25:24.190 --> 25:26.092
* I ain't like the molecule *

25:26.125 --> 25:29.395
* Why not, why not *

25:29.428 --> 25:31.030
* Why not, baby, why not *

25:31.063 --> 25:32.932
* I spot my type in the lineup *

25:32.965 --> 25:34.366
* I'm up on it
like we grinding *

25:34.400 --> 25:36.703
* But behind it
like your spine is *

25:36.736 --> 25:38.170
* I ain't go to college *

25:38.204 --> 25:40.439
* I was wiling
with them riders *

25:40.472 --> 25:42.441
-* Thank God
that I survived it... *

25:42.474 --> 25:44.176
Hey, not on the bed.
Off the bed.

25:44.210 --> 25:47.580
* I know *

25:47.614 --> 25:48.915
* Do you want to... *

25:48.948 --> 25:51.618
(muffled music
continues in distance)

25:51.651 --> 25:53.552
Mm!

25:55.588 --> 25:57.624
You, uh, want to make it
even better?

26:11.938 --> 26:14.340
I'm gonna save them
for later, okay?

26:18.778 --> 26:21.814
Occupied.

26:21.848 --> 26:25.051
-Jessie, come on, open up.
-Hey.

26:25.084 --> 26:27.754
-You first.
-I couldn't find you anywhere.
I was just...

26:27.787 --> 26:29.656
Following me around all night
and having zero fun?

26:29.689 --> 26:30.823
I'm making out with Tarzan.

26:30.857 --> 26:32.291
-Okay, you know what,

26:32.324 --> 26:33.793
this was a mistake. I shouldn't
have brought you here.

26:33.826 --> 26:35.561
-You said you trusted me.
-I guess I thought...

26:35.594 --> 26:37.329
I don't need a babysitter, Nic.
And you're not Mom.

26:37.363 --> 26:39.465
-Mom would never act like this.
You know why?
-Oh, come on.

26:39.498 --> 26:40.667
Because she actually
made things better.

26:40.700 --> 26:42.434
So why don't you leave me alone

26:42.468 --> 26:45.171
and go out there and drink
something with alcohol in it,

26:45.204 --> 26:46.839
and I'll drive us home
because, guess what,

26:46.873 --> 26:48.841
-I'm sober.
-Jess.

27:12.799 --> 27:15.802
KID'S VOICE:
Trick or treat.

27:33.152 --> 27:35.154
MAN :
Laurie!

27:35.187 --> 27:38.891
Lau...
Laurie.

27:38.925 --> 27:42.194
-No...
-Laurie! Laurie!

27:43.595 --> 27:46.365
Laurie!

27:46.398 --> 27:47.834
-Laurie!

27:54.506 --> 27:56.642
Laurie, stop!

27:56.675 --> 27:58.344
-It's okay. It's okay.

27:58.377 --> 27:59.645
-No, no, no, no, no!
-It's okay, it's okay.

27:59.678 --> 28:01.748
We can help you. John!

28:01.781 --> 28:03.549
-Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am...

28:13.425 --> 28:15.594
BELL:
Femoral bleed!

28:15.627 --> 28:17.529
Gauze, now!

28:20.399 --> 28:22.835
Hawkins, help me hold her down!

28:22.869 --> 28:25.071
I'm on it.

28:29.708 --> 28:33.012
I got her.
We're good, we're good.

28:33.045 --> 28:34.213
BOTH:
40 of ketamine.

28:37.449 --> 28:39.651
Come on. Ready?

28:40.652 --> 28:42.588
-Ready.
-All right,

28:42.621 --> 28:44.723
ready when you are.

28:54.500 --> 28:55.868
I got-I got pressure
on the artery.

28:55.902 --> 28:58.037
CT angio
and then prep for the OR.

28:58.070 --> 29:00.306
-Thought I did. It's unlike

29:00.339 --> 29:02.541
anything I've ever seen before.

29:02.574 --> 29:04.310
Well, find me
if you need fresh eyes.

29:04.343 --> 29:06.378
I will.

29:06.412 --> 29:09.281
-*

29:35.474 --> 29:37.844
Nic, what are you doing?

29:37.877 --> 29:41.013
-I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.
-Okay. Okay.

29:42.882 --> 29:44.583
Since when do you
have panic attacks?

29:44.616 --> 29:47.486
Hey, hey. Leave the room.
Genie, back in your bottle.

29:47.519 --> 29:49.621
-It's not something I advertise.

29:49.655 --> 29:51.090
Seriously

29:51.123 --> 29:52.524
Over a year.

29:52.558 --> 29:54.126
You can't just take care
of everyone except you,

29:54.160 --> 29:55.761
you know that, right?

29:55.794 --> 29:57.930
-Look, I'm managing.
Because you're sitting

29:57.964 --> 29:59.966
on a kitchen floor,
hyperventilating.

29:59.999 --> 30:01.433
I'm sorry.

30:01.467 --> 30:03.769
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

30:03.802 --> 30:06.772
-You're okay.

30:06.805 --> 30:10.542
You're okay. Just breathe.

30:10.576 --> 30:13.645
-I'm trying to.
-I know.

30:17.516 --> 30:20.152
It's so scary.

30:20.186 --> 30:23.689
I'm right here.
I'm right here, okay?

30:23.722 --> 30:26.025
Look who you're talking to.

30:26.058 --> 30:28.827
You're always here for me, Nic.
I'm here for you.

30:28.861 --> 30:30.863
-Lean back.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.644
NOLAN:
Bell told me what's up.

30:45.677 --> 30:47.079
Give me good news.

30:47.113 --> 30:49.048
Decent'll have to do.

30:49.081 --> 30:50.716
Surgery on Laurie's femoral
artery's gonna take about

30:50.749 --> 30:52.684
a half hour if there's no other
arteries or veins

30:52.718 --> 30:53.719
that are severed.

30:53.752 --> 30:55.487
All indications are they aren't.

30:55.521 --> 30:57.689
Let me know if that changes
once you get in the OR.

30:57.723 --> 30:59.525
Will do.

30:59.558 --> 31:01.160
Dr. Nolan.

31:01.193 --> 31:03.062
Check Laurie's lower abdomen

31:03.095 --> 31:06.232
while you're in there, between
the right hip and umbilicus.

31:06.265 --> 31:08.700
I'll be nearby, getting proximal
control for the repair,

31:08.734 --> 31:10.102
but I prefer to stay out
of her abdomen.

31:10.136 --> 31:13.105
Why do you want me to do that?

31:13.139 --> 31:15.074
Oh, that's-that's
an incidentaloma.

31:15.107 --> 31:17.043
-It's a benign growth.
It's nothing.
-Yeah, or it could be

31:17.076 --> 31:19.078
something that
explains everything.

31:20.646 --> 31:22.781
I'll give it a look.

31:43.769 --> 31:45.871
Dr. Bell.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.674
Vivian.

31:52.144 --> 31:54.880
Oh.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.248
Comes with the territory.

31:56.282 --> 31:58.650
You save their life?

31:58.684 --> 32:01.988
-I did.

32:02.021 --> 32:03.655
Save lives?

32:03.689 --> 32:07.093
Get set up on a blind date
by your assistant.

32:07.126 --> 32:08.794
Never.

32:08.827 --> 32:10.362
Me either.

32:11.830 --> 32:14.166
I'm not kicking myself
at the moment.

32:14.200 --> 32:16.802
Me either.

32:28.614 --> 32:30.649
Go save your patient.

32:32.651 --> 32:34.620
And I'll do my best

32:34.653 --> 32:37.123
to be patient.

32:43.729 --> 32:45.864
AUSTIN:
Dr. Bell. Sorry about
the 11th-hour page.

32:45.897 --> 32:47.666
I thought three surgeons
would do the trick.

32:47.699 --> 32:49.001
BELL:
You definitely need a fourth.

32:49.035 --> 32:51.270
I can go arm, leg,
or float between the two.

32:51.303 --> 32:52.604
I don't know,
Dr. Voss here is excited

32:52.638 --> 32:55.307
to reattach homeboy's missing
getaway stick.

32:55.341 --> 32:56.808
You and I will rock the arm,
all right?

32:56.842 --> 32:58.877
BELL:
Well, wouldn't it be great
if we could give

32:58.910 --> 33:01.047
this father of three the ability
to walk his daughter

33:01.080 --> 33:02.981
down the aisle one day?

33:03.015 --> 33:05.217
Hate to break your delicate
heart, Dr. Austin, but...

33:05.251 --> 33:06.618
I'll take Mina.
There, it's settled.

33:06.652 --> 33:09.688
AUSTIN:
Ladies on the leg.
All-stars on the arm.

33:09.721 --> 33:12.024
Is there a person
to go with the limbs, or...

33:14.893 --> 33:16.362
BELL:
He's crashing.

33:16.395 --> 33:18.197
Austin, you're on the scans.
Voss, circulation.

33:18.230 --> 33:20.966
KIT:
Pressure's 70/55.
Plummeting fast.

33:20.999 --> 33:24.002
-Uh, broken ribs, bruised lungs.

33:24.036 --> 33:25.804
Contained mediastinal bleeding
we need to watch.

33:25.837 --> 33:28.207
Abdomen and pelvis look good.
This is all hemorrhagic shock.

33:28.240 --> 33:30.642
Are we good with the massive
transfusion protocol?

33:30.676 --> 33:32.078
Got four units in the ER.

33:32.111 --> 33:33.579
Well, hang another two,
get the TXA ready,

33:33.612 --> 33:35.047
and call down to the blood bank.
We're gonna need everything

33:35.081 --> 33:36.848
-they've got.
-So much for walking
down the aisle.

33:36.882 --> 33:40.319
Let's make sure he lives
to see his children again.

33:41.887 --> 33:44.323
Quote:
"In nothing do men more nearly

33:44.356 --> 33:47.826
approach the gods
than in giving health to men."

33:47.859 --> 33:49.861
-Cicero.
-CONRAD: Quote:

33:49.895 --> 33:52.664
"Check Laurie's abdomen."

33:52.698 --> 33:55.367
Hawkins.

33:55.401 --> 33:58.104
Uh, Andy, I'm gonna need you

33:58.137 --> 34:01.740
to give me a little bit more
of that in this.

34:03.375 --> 34:05.043
How long has the leg
been severed?

34:05.077 --> 34:07.012
KIT:
Somewhere around five hours.

34:07.045 --> 34:10.382
I'm guessing 20 minutes before
that limb loses viability.

34:10.416 --> 34:11.783
Then perhaps the focus should be

34:11.817 --> 34:13.419
on the limb
you're trying to save.

34:13.452 --> 34:15.154
Uh, correction, lovey.
The limb we are saving.

34:17.556 --> 34:19.791
-Suction.

34:20.959 --> 34:22.394
Sponge.

34:22.428 --> 34:24.430
Clamp.

34:27.599 --> 34:28.900
BELL:
All right, keep transfusing.
Put him on

34:28.934 --> 34:31.103
Trendenlenburg.
He's bleeding out.

34:31.137 --> 34:32.904
KIT:
You're taking
too much blood away

34:32.938 --> 34:35.941
-from the leg. He'll necrose.
-We're losing the arm.

34:35.974 --> 34:37.943
-The artery was weakened.

34:37.976 --> 34:39.578
-AUSTIN: I don't know

34:39.611 --> 34:41.813
what you're talking about.
The problem's solved.

34:41.847 --> 34:44.483
New problem.

34:44.516 --> 34:46.885
He's bradying down.

34:46.918 --> 34:49.588
Get the ultrasound.

34:52.991 --> 34:56.128
Tamponade compressed his heart.

34:56.162 --> 34:58.164
The mediastinal bleed
must have opened up.

34:58.197 --> 35:01.567
Lacerated P-A.
Sternal saw to me.

35:03.869 --> 35:06.138
-No. We're good.

35:18.717 --> 35:20.286
Another two units PRBCs.

35:29.461 --> 35:31.363
Still trending down.

35:31.397 --> 35:33.532
I'm gonna need
more cardiac support.

35:33.565 --> 35:35.167
Slam that blood into him.

35:58.224 --> 36:01.693
(alarms stop,
monitor beeping steadily)

36:01.727 --> 36:04.463
-Vitals are improving.

36:04.496 --> 36:07.032
KIT and MINA:
Show-off.

36:07.065 --> 36:09.034
AUSTIN:
Hey, if you got it, flaunt it.

36:09.067 --> 36:10.636
BELL:
As we were.

36:10.669 --> 36:14.206
AUSTIN:
#TeamChastain, baby.

36:14.240 --> 36:16.575
NOLAN:
Laurie's recovering.
You were right.

36:16.608 --> 36:18.510
Checking the abdomen
was a good call.

36:21.947 --> 36:24.850
-This thing has teeth.
-It has a tooth.

36:24.883 --> 36:27.553
It's a teratoma.
It's not gonna bite you, Ricky.

36:27.586 --> 36:29.988
Teratomas are genetic anomalies
that reproduce organs,

36:30.021 --> 36:32.924
or sometimes bone or teeth,
all within a pocket of flesh.

36:32.958 --> 36:34.326
NOLAN:
Rare. Unpleasant.

36:34.360 --> 36:35.327
Perfectly appropriate discovery

36:35.361 --> 36:37.062
on All Hallows' Eve.

36:37.095 --> 36:38.997
Some teratomas create antibodies
that attack the brain,

36:39.030 --> 36:40.399
and this can lead
to encephalitis.

36:40.432 --> 36:42.033
-They can.
-We'll rerun her CSF panel

36:42.067 --> 36:45.571
for Anti-NMDA antibodies.

36:45.604 --> 36:47.606
I think we got this.

36:52.210 --> 36:53.579
Okay, that's enough.

37:04.256 --> 37:06.425
I'm really gonna be okay?

37:06.458 --> 37:08.226
Yes. Yes!

37:12.831 --> 37:16.201
Yeah. You have
Anti-NMDA encephalitis.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.736
It's a rare infection
of the brain.

37:17.769 --> 37:19.405
It was causing
all your symptoms.

37:19.438 --> 37:20.872
We're gonna give you
a combination

37:20.906 --> 37:22.474
of steroids and immunoglobulins.

37:22.508 --> 37:24.042
Your night terrors might persist
for a bit, but

37:24.075 --> 37:26.612
you should be back
to your normal life in no time.

37:26.645 --> 37:28.614
Ah. I haven't
spoken to my family

37:28.647 --> 37:32.551
in two years, but right now...

37:32.584 --> 37:34.820
can't wait to tell them
I'm gonna be okay.

37:34.853 --> 37:37.589
I just hope
they pick up the phone.

37:37.623 --> 37:38.990
Family is complicated.

37:39.024 --> 37:41.092
You just have to hope

37:41.126 --> 37:43.261
that they'll be there
for you in the end.

37:55.140 --> 37:57.643
You were right.

37:57.676 --> 38:01.279
I should string a few days
together, recharge my batteries.

38:01.313 --> 38:04.616
-Just say the word.
-I will.

38:04.650 --> 38:06.352
When you tell me the truth.

38:06.385 --> 38:08.520
Where were you today?

38:11.823 --> 38:14.259
Maybe when you stop lying to me,

38:14.292 --> 38:16.528
I'll consider going
to an island with you.

38:16.562 --> 38:20.131
Sharing everything all the time

38:20.165 --> 38:22.501
is not something
I'm interested in.

38:22.534 --> 38:24.770
Well, I am.

38:24.803 --> 38:26.638
Son, I'm a lot of things,

38:26.672 --> 38:29.375
but a hypocrite
isn't one of them.

38:29.408 --> 38:31.677
What's that supposed to mean?

38:31.710 --> 38:33.712
I'm not exactly sitting

38:33.745 --> 38:36.348
across from an open book.

38:36.382 --> 38:39.785
You left home and didn't tell me
where you were for ten years.

38:39.818 --> 38:42.988
I had to hire a private
investigator to track you down.

38:43.021 --> 38:46.191
So don't ask of me

38:46.224 --> 38:50.195
what you refuse
to ask of yourself.

38:54.165 --> 38:56.101
Get some rest.

39:10.215 --> 39:12.250
KIT:
Welcome back, Frank.

39:15.554 --> 39:17.589
What... what happened to me?

39:17.623 --> 39:20.025
Wee bit of a car accident.

39:20.058 --> 39:22.994
Dr. Voss and I were part
of the team that reattached

39:23.028 --> 39:25.931
your arm and your leg.

39:25.964 --> 39:27.733
Did

39:27.766 --> 39:29.768
Couple of times.

39:29.801 --> 39:32.538
The important thing
is you're here now.

39:32.571 --> 39:35.574
Yeah, m

39:35.607 --> 39:38.276
And daughters?

39:38.309 --> 39:40.412
Do

39:40.446 --> 39:44.249
Yeah. They're on their way
up here now.

39:50.456 --> 39:52.791
Hi.

39:52.824 --> 39:54.693
Hi. Um...

39:54.726 --> 39:58.129
Oh, it's-it's okay, sweetie.
It's okay.

39:58.163 --> 40:00.599
Daddy loves you, honey.

40:02.901 --> 40:05.904
Nice assist in the ER today,
Pravesh.

40:05.937 --> 40:07.439
Thanks, Dr. Austin.

40:07.473 --> 40:09.107
And what you pulled off
in the OR...

40:09.140 --> 40:11.777
Shh. I know what I did well.

40:11.810 --> 40:14.079
Isn't this the loveliest part
of the job?

40:14.112 --> 40:15.647
What part are we talking about?

40:15.681 --> 40:17.215
The part that makes you want

40:17.248 --> 40:19.317
to pick up the phone
and call your own kids.

40:19.350 --> 40:22.187
American Bobtail and a Maine
Coon are the only kids I got.

40:24.155 --> 40:26.157
Wait. You have human kids?

40:26.191 --> 40:28.293
Two, from my first marriage.

40:28.326 --> 40:29.928
All grown now.

40:29.961 --> 40:32.130
And one of my kids has a kid.

40:32.163 --> 40:34.432
Good night, chaps.

40:37.035 --> 40:39.237
Her kid has a kid.

40:39.270 --> 40:41.439
She's a grandmother.

40:46.778 --> 40:48.680
You know, I...

40:51.950 --> 40:54.085
You know, I was thinking

40:54.119 --> 40:56.588
that this indelible session

40:56.622 --> 40:58.289
would be...

40:58.323 --> 41:00.659
One time. No strings.

41:03.028 --> 41:05.631
I now find myself reconsidering.

41:05.664 --> 41:09.535
-Me too.
-Hmm.

41:09.568 --> 41:11.336
I got to say,
my new assistant was right

41:11.369 --> 41:13.038
about his matchmaking skills.

41:13.071 --> 41:15.006
We raised him right.

41:15.040 --> 41:19.110
My ex-husband is so hard on
Grayson, but I'm proud of him.

41:19.144 --> 41:21.312
He's a good son.

41:23.348 --> 41:25.416
What?

41:36.762 --> 41:38.797
Uh, where's Nic?

41:38.830 --> 41:40.832
Oh, I gave her the night off.

41:40.866 --> 41:43.001
So, the damage:

41:43.034 --> 41:46.572
three broken glasses,
a clogged sink, and...

41:46.605 --> 41:49.374
Holly Golightly spilled
a drink on your rug.

41:49.407 --> 41:51.376
It's never coming out.
I know. I'm sorry.

41:51.409 --> 41:54.145
Stop it.

41:54.179 --> 41:56.481
No, y stop it.

41:56.514 --> 41:58.717
You silly little minx.

41:58.750 --> 42:02.554
Oh, it's been going on
for a while.

42:02.588 --> 42:05.523
-It's actually kind of adorable.
Stop it.

42:05.557 --> 42:07.125
What a nightmare.

42:33.551 --> 42:34.620
Mom!

42:35.621 --> 42:36.622
Mom!

42:38.423 --> 42:41.559
MAN ;
Go now, boy.

42:41.593 --> 42:43.494
Get out of here, boy!

42:47.165 --> 42:50.368
Dad, no! Please!

42:50.401 --> 42:52.838
Please.

42:59.244 --> 43:01.279
Shh, shh. It's okay.

43:05.483 --> 43:07.485
Shh.

43:10.021 --> 43:12.023
Want to talk about it?

44:03.208 --> 44:05.176
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

44:07.312 --> 44:09.047
You survived your shift
with The Resident.

44:09.080 --> 44:11.649
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:14.085 --> 44:15.320
Buckle up, buttercup.

44:17.655 --> 44:19.991
It's real, and it pulls
people together.

44:20.025 --> 44:23.561
-* We're breaking waves
shooting star *

44:23.594 --> 44:27.165
* We live for glory
not forever *

44:27.198 --> 44:28.199
MAN: Touchdown!

44:28.233 --> 44:31.803
* Reach out *

44:31.837 --> 44:35.406
* Make this right here
right now *

44:35.440 --> 44:38.376
* Stand up *

44:39.244 --> 44:41.012
* Here right now *

44:41.046 --> 44:43.014
That sounds like fun.
