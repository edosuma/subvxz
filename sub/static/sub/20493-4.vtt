WEBVTT

00:06.867 --> 00:09.067
TONIGHT ON THE PROFIT...
I GO

00:06.867 --> 00:09.067
INSIDE ECO-ME, AN ALL-NATURAL

00:09.067 --> 00:12.167
CLEANING-PRODUCTS COMPANY RUN

00:09.067 --> 00:12.167
BY

00:09.067 --> 00:12.167
TWO LIFELONG FRIENDS.

00:12.167 --> 00:14.967
THIS BUSINESS IS RUNNING ON

00:12.167 --> 00:14.967
FUMES, AND IT CAN CLOSE ITS

00:14.967 --> 00:17.833
DOORS ANY DAY.

00:14.967 --> 00:17.833
WITHOUT ME, THIS BUSINESS

00:17.833 --> 00:21.200
DOESN'T MAKE IT.

00:17.833 --> 00:21.200
MY GOAL IS TO TURN ECO-ME

00:17.833 --> 00:21.200
INTO A

00:21.200 --> 00:24.800
$10 MILLION COMPANY, AND IN

00:21.200 --> 00:24.800
THAT

00:21.200 --> 00:24.800
PROCESS, I HAVE TO TEACH THESE

00:24.800 --> 00:27.633
TWO THAT BUSINESS ISN'T

00:24.800 --> 00:27.633
PERSONAL.

00:27.633 --> 00:29.167
YOU CAN'T FIRE ANY OF MY

00:27.633 --> 00:29.167
EMPLOYEES.

00:29.167 --> 00:31.633
IT'S A BUSINESS, ROBIN.

00:29.167 --> 00:31.633
IF THEY DON'T LISTEN...

00:31.633 --> 00:33.600
I'M SAYING "NO."

00:31.633 --> 00:33.600
MY NAME IS MARCUS LEMONIS, AND

00:33.600 --> 00:38.000
THIS COMPANY WILL CLOSE ITS

00:33.600 --> 00:38.000
DOORS.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.333
I FIX FAILING BUSINESSES.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.333
I'M WILLING TO WRITE A

00:40.333 --> 00:44.567
"HALF A MILLION DOLLAR" CHECK.

00:40.333 --> 00:44.567
I MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS.

00:44.567 --> 00:48.867
I'M NOT WILLING TO DO THE DEAL

00:44.567 --> 00:48.867
IF YOU'RE IN CHARGE OF SALES.

00:48.867 --> 00:52.067
BACK THEM UP WITH MY OWN CASH.

00:48.867 --> 00:52.067
IT'S NOT ALWAYS PRETTY.

00:52.067 --> 00:54.400
I'LL TAKE THE SHOWER.

00:52.067 --> 00:54.400
JEN, YOU TAKE THE TOILET.

00:54.400 --> 00:56.000
I DON'T DO THE TOILET IN MY

00:54.400 --> 00:56.000
OWN HOUSE.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.267
REALLY?

00:56.000 --> 00:58.267
BUT THIS IS BUSINESS.

00:58.267 --> 01:01.633
I DO IT TO SAVE JOBS, AND I DO

00:58.267 --> 01:01.633
IT TO MAKE MONEY.

01:01.633 --> 01:02.700
 THE PROFIT.

01:02.700 --> 01:03.700
[upbeat music]

01:03.700 --> 01:11.600
? 

01:14.033 --> 01:17.233
ECO-ME IS AN ALL-NATURAL

01:14.033 --> 01:17.233
CLEANING PRODUCT STARTED BY

01:17.233 --> 01:21.367
ROBIN KAY LEVINE IN 2006.

01:17.233 --> 01:21.367
WITH THE PARTNERSHIP OF HER

01:21.367 --> 01:25.733
CHILDHOOD FRIEND JEN MIHAJLOV,

01:21.367 --> 01:25.733
A 12% OWNER, THEY BUILT ECO-ME

01:25.733 --> 01:29.467
UP FROM A SMALL,

01:25.733 --> 01:29.467
DO-IT-YOURSELF

01:25.733 --> 01:29.467
CLEANING KIT TO A 17-PIECE

01:29.467 --> 01:31.767
CLEANING LINE, INCLUDING

01:29.467 --> 01:31.767
DOG-GROOMING PRODUCTS.

01:31.767 --> 01:34.800
THIS PRODUCT IS SOLD

01:31.767 --> 01:34.800
NATIONWIDE

01:31.767 --> 01:34.800
AT STORES LIKE WHOLE FOODS AND

01:34.800 --> 01:37.733
TARGET, AND LAST YEAR THEY DID

01:34.800 --> 01:37.733
A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS IN

01:37.733 --> 01:41.300
SALES, WITH ONLY SIX

01:37.733 --> 01:41.300
EMPLOYEES.

01:37.733 --> 01:41.300
I PERSONALLY USE THIS

01:41.300 --> 01:45.000
PRODUCT IN MY OWN HOME AND

01:41.300 --> 01:45.000
FIND

01:41.300 --> 01:45.000
THAT IT WORKS EXTREMELY WELL.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.900
TO STAY IN BUSINESS, ROBIN HAS

01:45.000 --> 01:47.900
LEVERAGED FRIENDS AND FAMILY

01:45.000 --> 01:47.900
TO

01:47.900 --> 01:51.067
FIND EVERY PENNY SHE CAN, AND

01:47.900 --> 01:51.067
THEY'RE NEARLY A HALF A

01:47.900 --> 01:51.067
MILLION

01:51.067 --> 01:53.900
DOLLARS IN DEBT.

01:51.067 --> 01:53.900
I'M REALLY FREAKING OUT

01:51.067 --> 01:53.900
RIGHT

01:53.900 --> 01:56.333
NOW.

01:53.900 --> 01:56.333
HOUSEHOLD CLEANING IS A

01:56.333 --> 01:59.767
MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR INDUSTRY,

01:56.333 --> 01:59.767
AND ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS

01:59.767 --> 02:02.367
PRODUCTS ARE BECOMING MORE

01:59.767 --> 02:02.367
POPULAR WITH CUSTOMERS EVERY

02:02.367 --> 02:05.100
DAY.

02:02.367 --> 02:05.100
ECO-ME HAS A GREAT

02:02.367 --> 02:05.100
ENVIRONMENTAL

02:05.100 --> 02:06.533
PRODUCT.

02:05.100 --> 02:06.533
AND IF THEY DON'T TURN AROUND

02:06.533 --> 02:09.032
THEIR FINANCES, THEY'RE GONNA

02:06.533 --> 02:09.032
HAVE TO CLOSE THEIR DOORS, AND

02:09.032 --> 02:12.000
ALL THEIR WORKERS WILL BE OUT

02:09.032 --> 02:12.000
OF

02:09.032 --> 02:12.000
JOBS.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.933
WITH THE RIGHT CHANGES, I CAN

02:12.000 --> 02:14.933
MAKE ECO-ME PROFITABLE AND

02:12.000 --> 02:14.933
TURN

02:14.933 --> 02:16.600
THIS INTO A

02:14.933 --> 02:16.600
MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR

02:16.600 --> 02:18.033
BUSINESS IN NO TIME.

02:18.033 --> 02:19.667
I SEE THE POTENTIAL TO MAKE A

02:19.667 --> 02:21.833
LOT OF MONEY.

02:29.667 --> 02:32.433
ECO-ME HAS A SMALL,

02:29.667 --> 02:32.433
2,000-SQUARE-FOOT WAREHOUSE,

02:29.667 --> 02:32.433
AND

02:32.433 --> 02:35.400
THERE ISN'T ANY SIGNIFICANT

02:32.433 --> 02:35.400
MACHINERY TO BE SEEN ANYWHERE.

02:35.400 --> 02:38.400
WHAT I SEE IS A LOT OF WORK

02:35.400 --> 02:38.400
BEING DONE MANUALLY.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.500
I ALREADY SEE BIG PROBLEMS.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.500
HI.

02:40.500 --> 02:42.967
HOW ARE YOU?

02:40.500 --> 02:42.967
WHERE DO I FIND ROBIN AND JEN?

02:42.967 --> 02:45.467
RIGHT THROUGH THIS DOOR.

02:42.967 --> 02:45.467
HOW ARE YOU?

02:45.467 --> 02:46.900

02:45.467 --> 02:46.900
I'M ROBIN.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.567
ROBIN, I'M MARCUS.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.567
VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.

02:48.567 --> 02:51.000
NICE TO MEET YOU TOO.

02:48.567 --> 02:51.000
YOU GUYS HAVE THIS PLACE

02:48.567 --> 02:51.000

02:51.000 --> 02:52.333

02:51.000 --> 02:52.333
THANKS.

02:52.333 --> 02:53.667
OH, THIS IS JEN.

02:52.333 --> 02:53.667
OH, HEY, JEN.

02:53.667 --> 02:55.667
HI.

02:53.667 --> 02:55.667
MARCUS.

02:55.667 --> 02:57.033
NICE TO MEET YOU.

02:55.667 --> 02:57.033
SO, IS THIS PRETTY MUCH...

02:57.033 --> 02:58.367
WELL, THIS IS THE FRONT

02:57.033 --> 02:58.367
OFFICE.

02:58.367 --> 02:59.833
OKAY.

02:58.367 --> 02:59.833
THIS IS MY OFFICE, AND WHEN

02:59.833 --> 03:01.700
JEN COMES INTO TOWN--'CAUSE

02:59.833 --> 03:01.700
SHE'S BASED OUT OF THE EAST

03:01.700 --> 03:02.367
COAST--

03:01.700 --> 03:02.367
MILES AWAY FROM WHERE OUR

03:02.367 --> 03:03.733
OH, WOW.

03:02.367 --> 03:03.733
AND SHE WORKS IN HERE ALSO.

03:03.733 --> 03:08.067
I CAN'T IMAGINE HAVING A

03:03.733 --> 03:08.067
CO-WORKER, AN EMPLOYEE 3,000

03:08.067 --> 03:10.400
BUSINESS IS.

03:08.067 --> 03:10.400
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND PHONE AND

03:10.400 --> 03:13.900
EMAIL, BUT NOTHING REPLACES

03:10.400 --> 03:13.900
HUMAN INTERACTION.

03:13.900 --> 03:16.233
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IS,

03:13.900 --> 03:16.233
WHY DID YOU START THE COMPANY?

03:16.233 --> 03:19.733
SO, IN 2005, MY SISTER WAS

03:16.233 --> 03:19.733
DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER.

03:19.733 --> 03:22.767
WE WERE LIKE, "HOW DID SHE

03:19.733 --> 03:22.767
EVEN

03:19.733 --> 03:22.767
GET CANCER IN THE FIRST

03:19.733 --> 03:22.767
PLACE?"

03:22.767 --> 03:25.000
I WENT BACK TO BE WITH MY

03:22.767 --> 03:25.000
FAMILY

03:22.767 --> 03:25.000
AND HELP MY SISTER THROUGH HER

03:25.000 --> 03:28.200
TREATMENTS, AND THERE WAS ONE

03:25.000 --> 03:28.200
DAY WHERE I SAID, "MOM, I'M

03:25.000 --> 03:28.200
NOT

03:28.200 --> 03:29.567
GONNA GO WITH YOU GUYS TO THE

03:28.200 --> 03:29.567
DOCTORS.

03:29.567 --> 03:31.100
I NEED A BREAK."

03:29.567 --> 03:31.100
AND SHE SAID, "YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:31.100 --> 03:33.367
YOUR SISTER DOESN'T GET A

03:31.100 --> 03:33.367
BREAK."

03:33.367 --> 03:35.633
AND I WAS LIKE, "WOW."

03:33.367 --> 03:35.633
TALK ABOUT, LIKE, A WATERWORKS

03:35.633 --> 03:37.200
MOMENT.

03:35.633 --> 03:37.200
AND SHE SAID, "WHY DON'T YOU

03:37.200 --> 03:39.200
JUST CLEAN HER APARTMENT?

03:37.200 --> 03:39.200
MAKE IT REALLY NICE.

03:39.200 --> 03:41.200
WHEN SHE COMES HOME, IT CAN BE

03:39.200 --> 03:41.200
NICE FOR HER."

03:41.200 --> 03:43.967
AND I WAS JUST OPENING UP THAT

03:41.200 --> 03:43.967
CABINET UNDER THE SINK, AND

03:41.200 --> 03:43.967
I'M

03:43.967 --> 03:47.433
JUST STARING AT ALL THE

03:43.967 --> 03:47.433
CHEMICAL

03:43.967 --> 03:47.433
STUFF AND THE SMELL OF IT, AND

03:47.433 --> 03:49.567
I SAID, "OH, MY GOD!

03:47.433 --> 03:49.567
I CAN'T CLEAN WITH THIS STUFF.

03:49.567 --> 03:51.533
I DON'T WANT HER TO CONTINUE

03:49.567 --> 03:51.533
TO

03:49.567 --> 03:51.533
GET SICKER."

03:51.533 --> 03:53.833
AND I WENT, AND I GOT VINEGAR,

03:51.533 --> 03:53.833
BAKING SODA, OLIVE OIL.

03:53.833 --> 03:56.433
I GOOGLED, LIKE, HOW TO MAKE

03:53.833 --> 03:56.433
YOUR OWN STUFF, WHAT TO DO,

03:53.833 --> 03:56.433
AND

03:56.433 --> 04:00.167
THAT JUST REALLY STARTED A

03:56.433 --> 04:00.167
SNOWBALL, AND I TOTALLY PULLED

04:00.167 --> 04:02.333
JEN IN--

04:00.167 --> 04:02.333
"I'VE NEVER DONE SALES AND

04:02.333 --> 04:04.100
MARKETING, BUT THAT'S YOUR

04:02.333 --> 04:04.100
BACKGROUND.

04:04.100 --> 04:06.567
YOU HAVE TO COME WITH ME."

04:04.100 --> 04:06.567
SO YOU OVERSEE SALES?

04:06.567 --> 04:08.167
YES.

04:06.567 --> 04:08.167
SO I WENT.

04:08.167 --> 04:09.500
SHE WENT.

04:08.167 --> 04:09.500
AND THAT WAS IT.

04:09.500 --> 04:10.833
I WAS HOOKED.

04:09.500 --> 04:10.833
SHE WAS HOOKED.

04:10.833 --> 04:13.133
ROBIN, SO THIS ISN'T REALLY

04:10.833 --> 04:13.133
JUST ABOUT THE PRODUCTS ON THE

04:13.133 --> 04:14.467
SHELF FOR YOU, IS IT?

04:13.133 --> 04:14.467
NO.

04:14.467 --> 04:15.800
NO.

04:14.467 --> 04:15.800
NO.

04:15.800 --> 04:19.533
ECO-ME IS PART MY IDENTITY.

04:15.800 --> 04:19.533
IT IS PART OF WHO I AM, AND WE

04:19.533 --> 04:22.633
WORK THESE DAYS TO OBVIOUSLY

04:19.533 --> 04:22.633
MAKE MONEY TO PUT IN OUR

04:19.533 --> 04:22.633
POCKET

04:22.633 --> 04:25.267
AND FEED OUR FAMILIES, BUT TO

04:22.633 --> 04:25.267
DO

04:22.633 --> 04:25.267
SOMETHING THAT MEANS MORE,

04:25.267 --> 04:27.233
IT'S PRETTY AWESOME TO BE A

04:25.267 --> 04:27.233
PART

04:25.267 --> 04:27.233
OF THAT.

04:27.233 --> 04:29.333
YOU GUYS HAVE A LOT OF YOUR

04:27.233 --> 04:29.333
OWN MONEY IN THE BUSINESS?

04:29.333 --> 04:31.167
YEAH.

04:29.333 --> 04:31.167
HOW MUCH DEBT IN TOTAL

04:31.167 --> 04:33.500
EXISTS?

04:31.167 --> 04:33.500
IF YOU WERE JUST ROUGH-BALLING

04:33.500 --> 04:35.900
IT?

04:33.500 --> 04:35.900
WELL, CLOSE TO $500,000.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.633
WOW.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.633
LAST YEAR WAS THE YEAR I

04:35.900 --> 04:37.633
WAS

04:37.633 --> 04:40.267
SUPPOSED TO GET PAID, AND IT

04:37.633 --> 04:40.267
DIDN'T HAPPEN, AND IT'S

04:40.267 --> 04:45.500
INCREDIBLY HARD FOR ME,

04:40.267 --> 04:45.500
FEELING

04:40.267 --> 04:45.500
THE RESPONSIBILITY, TO PULL

04:40.267 --> 04:45.500
ANY

04:45.500 --> 04:48.367
MONEY FROM THE COMPANY WHEN

04:45.500 --> 04:48.367
I KNOW THAT I HAVEN'T PAID

04:48.367 --> 04:50.633
PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING AND

04:48.367 --> 04:50.633
FOLLOWING MY LEAD.

04:50.633 --> 04:52.267
WHEN IS THE LAST TIME YOU

04:50.633 --> 04:52.267
GOT

04:50.633 --> 04:52.267
PAID?

04:52.267 --> 04:55.200
IT VARIES, BUT EVEN IF I--

04:52.267 --> 04:55.200
WE'RE BACK TO NOVEMBER

04:52.267 --> 04:55.200
STILL

04:55.200 --> 04:56.533
WITH YOU, THOUGH.

04:55.200 --> 04:56.533
YEAH. YEAH.

04:56.533 --> 05:00.133
WHAT'S YOUR BIGGEST FEAR?

04:56.533 --> 05:00.133
THAT THIS COMPANY WON'T

05:00.133 --> 05:01.967
SURVIVE.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.967
IF YOU DON'T RAISE MONEY,

05:00.133 --> 05:01.967
IS

05:01.967 --> 05:03.633
THAT A POSSIBILITY?

05:01.967 --> 05:03.633
YEAH.

05:03.633 --> 05:05.133
OF COURSE, YEAH.

05:03.633 --> 05:05.133
IT'S ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY.

05:05.133 --> 05:07.267
LOOK, ROBIN AND JEN HAVE A

05:05.133 --> 05:07.267
GREAT STARTING POINT WITH THIS

05:07.267 --> 05:10.033
COMPANY, AND AS YOU CAN TELL,

05:07.267 --> 05:10.033
THIS BUSINESS MEANS A LOT TO

05:10.033 --> 05:13.067
THEM, AND THEY'VE DONE A GOOD

05:10.033 --> 05:13.067
JOB, BUT IT'S TIME FOR ME TO

05:13.067 --> 05:15.900
DELVE INTO THE DETAILS AND

05:13.067 --> 05:15.900
LOOK

05:13.067 --> 05:15.900
AT PEOPLE, PROCESS, AND

05:13.067 --> 05:15.900
PRODUCT

05:15.900 --> 05:18.667
TO SEE WHAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED.

05:15.900 --> 05:18.667
I'D LIKE TO LEARN A LITTLE BIT

05:18.667 --> 05:21.300
MORE ABOUT THE PRODUCT.

05:18.667 --> 05:21.300
IT'S JUST VINEGAR WATER, A

05:21.300 --> 05:23.600
LITTLE SOLUBILIZER, AND OUR

05:21.300 --> 05:23.600
ESSENTIAL OILS.

05:23.600 --> 05:27.233
IT'S THE MOST SIMPLE, CLEAN,

05:23.600 --> 05:27.233
EFFECTIVE PRODUCT ON THE

05:23.600 --> 05:27.233
MARKET.

05:27.233 --> 05:30.867
EACH OF THE PRODUCT HAS A

05:27.233 --> 05:30.867
NAME.

05:27.233 --> 05:30.867
FOR INSTANCE, WHERE THEY PICK

05:27.233 --> 05:30.867
UP

05:30.867 --> 05:33.733
A FLOOR CLEANER, IT SAYS

05:30.867 --> 05:33.733
"DAVE,"

05:30.867 --> 05:33.733
AND THEY SAY, "OH, MY

05:33.733 --> 05:36.667
GRANDFATHER'S NAME WAS DAVE."

05:33.733 --> 05:36.667
PHIL IS--OUR TOILET BOWL

05:33.733 --> 05:36.667
CLEANER

05:36.667 --> 05:39.433
IS NAMED AFTER ONE OF OUR

05:36.667 --> 05:39.433
DISTRIBUTOR REPS, SO IT REALLY

05:39.433 --> 05:41.533
IS CATCHY, AND IT STICKS WITH

05:39.433 --> 05:41.533
THE CONSUMER.

05:41.533 --> 05:44.467
SO THE NAME OF THE PRODUCT

05:41.533 --> 05:44.467
IS EMMA OR ECO-ME OR--

05:44.467 --> 05:47.833
SO THE STORY IS THAT THERE

05:44.467 --> 05:47.833
IS AN EMMA, AND THESE ARE ALL

05:47.833 --> 05:49.167
NAMED AFTER OUR FRIENDS AND

05:47.833 --> 05:49.167
FAMILY--

05:49.167 --> 05:50.500
WHAT IS THE ACTUAL TRUTH?

05:49.167 --> 05:50.500
IS THERE AN EMMA?

05:50.500 --> 05:51.833
THERE IS AN EMMA, YEAH.

05:50.500 --> 05:51.833
THERE IS AN EMMA.

05:51.833 --> 05:53.867
A TOILET BOWL CLEANER

05:51.833 --> 05:53.867
CALLED

05:51.833 --> 05:53.867
PHIL?

05:53.867 --> 05:56.800
A LAUNDRY DETERGENT CALLED

05:53.867 --> 05:56.800
EMMA

05:53.867 --> 05:56.800
OR EMILY OR--I CAN'T EVEN KEEP

05:56.800 --> 05:59.333
IT STRAIGHT.

05:56.800 --> 05:59.333
I'VE NEVER SEEN A MARKETING

05:56.800 --> 05:59.333
PLAN

05:59.333 --> 06:01.500
THIS BAD.

05:59.333 --> 06:01.500
SO, ROBIN, I'M A BIG PEOPLE,

06:01.500 --> 06:05.933
PROCESS, PRODUCT GUY.

06:01.500 --> 06:05.933
THE PRODUCT ITSELF IS GOOD.

06:05.933 --> 06:10.633
IT HAS GOOD PURPOSE, A GOOD

06:05.933 --> 06:10.633
MISSION, AND IT WORKS, BUT AS

06:05.933 --> 06:10.633
A

06:10.633 --> 06:13.533
BUSINESS GUY, IT'S REALLY--

06:10.633 --> 06:13.533
I'M STRUGGLING WITH THIS.

06:13.533 --> 06:18.400
I THINK IT'S TERRIBLE.

06:13.533 --> 06:18.400
YOU GOT TO HAVE A BRAND, NOT

06:18.400 --> 06:21.300
KATE, JACK, EMMA, DAVE.

06:18.400 --> 06:21.300
IT'S JUST TOO MUCH.

06:21.300 --> 06:22.733
MM-HMM.

06:21.300 --> 06:22.733
MAKE SENSE?

06:22.733 --> 06:24.733
WE DON'T WANT TO BE LIKE

06:22.733 --> 06:24.733
EVERYBODY ELSE.

06:24.733 --> 06:27.967
THIS BRAND IS VERY PERSONAL TO

06:24.733 --> 06:27.967
ME, AND IT WAS BUILT ON OUR

06:27.967 --> 06:32.133
FRIENDS AND FAMILY, AND IN THE

06:27.967 --> 06:32.133
MARKETPLACE, PEOPLE KNOW EMMA.

06:32.133 --> 06:33.900
THEY KNOW BILL.

06:32.133 --> 06:33.900
WHAT MATTERS IS WHAT'S

06:33.900 --> 06:35.700
INSIDE.

06:33.900 --> 06:35.700
WHAT MATTERS IS WHAT THE

06:35.700 --> 06:37.633
CUSTOMER SEES ON THE SHELF.

06:35.700 --> 06:37.633
WELL, THE CUSTOMER'S NOT

06:37.633 --> 06:40.367
BUYING MUCH OF IT, SO...

06:37.633 --> 06:40.367
'CAUSE TO ME, PRIDE OF

06:40.367 --> 06:43.033
AUTHORSHIP IS A VERY DANGEROUS

06:40.367 --> 06:43.033
MISTAKE THAT PEOPLE MAKE IN

06:43.033 --> 06:45.200
BUSINESS.

06:43.033 --> 06:45.200
I KNOW YOU HAVE YOUR

06:43.033 --> 06:45.200
OPINION,

06:45.200 --> 06:48.833
AND I RESPECT THAT, BUT I

06:45.200 --> 06:48.833
DON'T

06:45.200 --> 06:48.833
FULLY AGREE WITH IT.

06:48.833 --> 06:51.667
IT'S GOOD TO BE PASSIONATE

06:48.833 --> 06:51.667
ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS, BUT WHEN

06:51.667 --> 06:54.733
YOU HAVE A PRIDE OF AUTHORSHIP

06:51.667 --> 06:54.733
THAT CLOUDS YOUR JUDGMENT,

06:54.733 --> 06:56.600
YOU'RE GONNA GET YOURSELF INTO

06:54.733 --> 06:56.600
REAL TROUBLE.

06:56.600 --> 06:58.733
THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND THEIR

06:56.600 --> 06:58.733
IDEA ISN'T WORKING.

06:58.733 --> 07:00.400
CAN YOU GUYS GIVE ME A TOUR?

06:58.733 --> 07:00.400
YEAH.

07:00.400 --> 07:01.800
SURE.

07:00.400 --> 07:01.800
THE OFFICE NEXT DOOR IS

07:01.800 --> 07:02.900
JOYCE FRENZEL, AND SHE'S OUR

07:01.800 --> 07:02.900

07:02.900 --> 07:04.300

07:07.733 --> 07:09.433

07:09.433 --> 07:10.933
THE CAMERAS ARE HERE?

07:09.433 --> 07:10.933
NO.

07:10.933 --> 07:12.367
MY BOSS IS RIGHT THERE.

07:10.933 --> 07:12.367
SHE SAID THAT BECAUSE I'M

07:12.367 --> 07:13.733
HERE.

07:12.367 --> 07:13.733
BECAUSE YOUR BOSS IS RIGHT

07:13.733 --> 07:16.733
THERE?

07:13.733 --> 07:16.733
YOU DON'T WANT TO GET FIRED.

07:16.733 --> 07:20.133
THIS IS OUR WAREHOUSE.

07:16.733 --> 07:20.133
WE BASICALLY HAVE DRUMS THAT

07:16.733 --> 07:20.133
WE

07:20.133 --> 07:22.400
DO ALL OUR BATCHING IN.

07:20.133 --> 07:22.400
SHOULD I THINK ABOUT THIS

07:22.400 --> 07:25.200
LIKE A BIG RECIPE BATCH...

07:22.400 --> 07:25.200
ABSOLUTELY.

07:25.200 --> 07:27.167
ADDING INGREDIENTS LIKE A

07:25.200 --> 07:27.167
MAD

07:25.200 --> 07:27.167
SCIENTIST?

07:27.167 --> 07:28.500
both: YES.

07:27.167 --> 07:28.500
OKAY.

07:28.500 --> 07:29.833
BUT WE'RE NOT MAD.

07:28.500 --> 07:29.833
WE'RE HAPPY.

07:29.833 --> 07:34.567
[laughter]

07:29.833 --> 07:34.567

07:34.567 --> 07:37.367
CASTILE SOAP, AND IT'S ONE OF

THE BEST CASTILE SOAPS YOU CAN

07:37.367 --> 07:38.967

07:37.367 --> 07:38.967
SO WHAT'S SOMETHING LIKE

07:38.967 --> 07:40.733
THIS COST?

07:38.967 --> 07:40.733
WHAT IS A TOTE?

07:40.733 --> 07:42.067

07:42.067 --> 07:43.400
YES.

07:43.400 --> 07:44.767
RIGHT.

07:43.400 --> 07:44.767
HOW MUCH PRODUCTION CAN YOU

07:44.767 --> 07:47.200
GET OUT OF THIS?

07:44.767 --> 07:47.200
JUST UNDER 5,000 UNITS.

WE DON'T HAVE A TON OF ROOM

07:47.200 --> 07:50.233

KNOW, 5,000 TO 10,000 UNITS.

07:53.467 --> 07:57.000
BUT SPACE IS ONE

07:57.000 --> 07:58.500
CONFINEMENT...

07:57.000 --> 07:58.500
YEAH.

07:58.500 --> 08:01.233
FOR NOT HAVING MORE OF

07:58.500 --> 08:01.233

YOUR BUSINESS THAT WAY IS...

08:08.567 --> 08:11.067
YEAH.

08:11.067 --> 08:12.833
NOT GOOD FOR YOU.

08:11.067 --> 08:12.833
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE

08:11.067 --> 08:12.833
BUSINESS.

08:12.833 --> 08:14.833
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR ANYBODY.

08:12.833 --> 08:14.833
IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE WORKING

08:14.833 --> 08:17.433
CAPITAL, IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE

08:14.833 --> 08:17.433
HUMAN CAPITAL...

CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR ABILITY

08:18.100 --> 08:20.467
TO

08:20.467 --> 08:21.800
YES.

08:20.467 --> 08:21.800
THIS BUSINESS IS FACING A

08:21.800 --> 08:25.233
SLEW OF ISSUES, INCLUDING THE

08:21.800 --> 08:25.233
PRODUCTION PROCESS, THE LACK

08:21.800 --> 08:25.233
OF

08:25.233 --> 08:29.867
MACHINERY, AND THE LACK OF

08:25.233 --> 08:29.867
MANPOWER, BUT I'M MOSTLY

08:29.867 --> 08:32.700
SELL.

08:29.867 --> 08:32.700
JEN IS A SALES TEAM OF ONE,

08:29.867 --> 08:32.700
AND

08:32.700 --> 08:36.100
SHE LIVES 3,000 MILES AWAY.

08:32.700 --> 08:36.100
LET ME MEET UP WITH THESE

08:32.700 --> 08:36.100
FOLKS

08:36.100 --> 08:36.767

08:36.100 --> 08:36.767
OKAY.

08:36.767 --> 08:38.100

HEY. HOW ARE YOU?

08:38.100 --> 08:40.133

08:41.467 --> 08:43.467
RAUL, NICE TO MEET YOU.

08:43.467 --> 08:45.533
both: NICE TO MEET YOU.

08:43.467 --> 08:45.533
ARE THERE EVER DAYS WHEN

08:43.467 --> 08:45.533
YOU

08:45.533 --> 08:47.767
COME IN HERE AND YOU WONDER,

08:45.533 --> 08:47.767
"CAN THE BUSINESS MAKE IT IN

08:47.767 --> 08:49.600
THIS TOUGH ECONOMY?"

08:47.767 --> 08:49.600
YEAH, THAT'S BEEN IN THE

08:47.767 --> 08:49.600
BACK

08:49.600 --> 08:52.367
OF MY MIND.

08:49.600 --> 08:52.367
I KNOW IT CAN GROW, BUT WILL

08:49.600 --> 08:52.367
IT

08:52.367 --> 08:54.000
GROW?

08:52.367 --> 08:54.000
SO TELL ME ABOUT YOUR

08:54.000 --> 08:56.100
PROCESS.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.100
COME GET THE BOTTLES.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.467
OKAY.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.467
SO WE GOT A BLANK BOTTLE.

08:57.467 --> 08:59.700
THEN WE TAKE IT TO LABEL

08:57.467 --> 08:59.700
IT.

08:57.467 --> 08:59.700
THESE LABELS ARE PROBABLY TOO

08:59.700 --> 09:01.500
BIG.

08:59.700 --> 09:01.500
THE ROLL IS TOO LONG, SO IT

08:59.700 --> 09:01.500
WILL

09:01.500 --> 09:03.600
NOT FIT ON THAT MACHINE HERE.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.600
WHAT ARE YOU, RIGGING THE

09:03.600 --> 09:05.267
THING?

09:03.600 --> 09:05.267
YEAH, BECAUSE THE ROLL IS

09:03.600 --> 09:05.267
TOO

09:05.267 --> 09:06.700
BIG.

09:05.267 --> 09:06.700
NOT ONLY DO YOU NOT HAVE

09:05.267 --> 09:06.700
THE

09:06.700 --> 09:09.633
AUTOMATED MACHINE, THIS

09:06.700 --> 09:09.633
MACHINE

09:06.700 --> 09:09.633
DOESN'T EVEN WORK FOR WHAT YOU

09:09.633 --> 09:11.000
HAVE.

09:09.633 --> 09:11.000
RIGHT.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.767
HOW LONG DOES THIS NORMALLY

09:11.000 --> 09:12.767
TAKE?

09:12.767 --> 09:14.467
ON A GOOD DAY, WE CAN

09:12.767 --> 09:14.467
PROBABLY GET MAYBE

09:14.467 --> 09:17.267
1,200 BOTTLES.

09:14.467 --> 09:17.267
THIS IS JUST A BULL[bleep]

09:17.267 --> 09:20.767
PROCESS.

09:17.267 --> 09:20.767
VERY LONG, VERY TEDIOUS.

09:20.767 --> 09:22.833
NOW LET'S SEE OVER HERE.

09:20.767 --> 09:22.833
WHAT HAPPENS OVER HERE?

09:22.833 --> 09:26.867
THIS IS THE FILLER MACHINE.

09:22.833 --> 09:26.867
ONE.

09:26.867 --> 09:30.367
WOW.

09:26.867 --> 09:30.367
THESE MACHINES ARE SMALL AND

09:30.367 --> 09:33.967
JERRY-RIGGED, AND THE WORKFLOW

09:30.367 --> 09:33.967
IS SLOW AND INEFFICIENT.

09:33.967 --> 09:37.567
IF THEY CAN ONLY FILL

09:33.967 --> 09:37.567
1,200 BOTTLES ON A GOOD DAY,

09:33.967 --> 09:37.567
IT

09:37.567 --> 09:41.233
WOULD TAKE THEM SEVERAL WEEKS

09:37.567 --> 09:41.233
TO

09:37.567 --> 09:41.233
FILL A 10,000-BOTTLE ORDER.

09:41.233 --> 09:42.567
THIS ISN'T GONNA WORK.

09:41.233 --> 09:42.567
YOU HAVE ONE.

09:42.567 --> 09:43.967
I WANT YOU TO TAKE ME THROUGH

09:42.567 --> 09:43.967
HOW THIS WORKS.

09:43.967 --> 09:45.733
YOU HAVE TO TURN ON THE

09:43.967 --> 09:45.733
MACHINE.

09:45.733 --> 09:50.233
[machine humming]

09:45.733 --> 09:50.233
YOU SET IT DOWN ON THE FLOOR.

09:50.233 --> 09:52.033
THIS IS HOW WE SET THE TIME

09:50.233 --> 09:52.033
FOR

09:50.233 --> 09:52.033
THE FILL.

09:52.033 --> 09:54.167
IT'S A GUESS, ISN'T IT?

09:52.033 --> 09:54.167
UNTIL WE GET IT ACCURATE,

09:54.167 --> 09:55.833
YES.

09:54.167 --> 09:55.833
THESE LOOK FULL, BUT NOT

09:55.833 --> 09:57.167
REALLY.

09:55.833 --> 09:57.167
NO.

09:57.167 --> 09:58.600
THEY'RE A LITTLE SHORT.

09:57.167 --> 09:58.600
THEY'D BE SHORT.

09:58.600 --> 10:00.100
SO WHAT DOES THIS NEED TO

09:58.600 --> 10:00.100
WEIGH?

10:00.100 --> 10:02.533
THESE SHOULD WEIGH ABOUT

10:00.100 --> 10:02.533
35 OUNCES.

10:02.533 --> 10:05.467
SEE, THAT'S OVER.

10:02.533 --> 10:05.467
SO, WHEN IT'S OVER, WHAT WE

10:05.467 --> 10:10.133
WOULD DO--POUR IT OUT.

10:05.467 --> 10:10.133
NOW YOU'RE STILL OVER.

10:10.133 --> 10:13.567
I'M OVER.

10:10.133 --> 10:13.567
SO I POUR A LITTLE BIT OUT.

10:13.567 --> 10:16.667
I'M STILL OVER.

10:13.567 --> 10:16.667
UH-HUH.

10:16.667 --> 10:20.100
THIS PROCESS IS CRAZY, AND

10:16.667 --> 10:20.100
IT'S

10:16.667 --> 10:20.100
INEFFICIENT.

10:20.100 --> 10:23.767
IT TOOK OVER A MINUTE TO FILL

10:20.100 --> 10:23.767
A

10:20.100 --> 10:23.767
SINGLE BOTTLE, AND THAT

10:20.100 --> 10:23.767
DOESN'T

10:23.767 --> 10:27.433
EVEN INCLUDE THE LABELING.

10:23.767 --> 10:27.433
INEFFICIENCY WILL KILL THIS

10:27.433 --> 10:29.500
BUSINESS.

10:27.433 --> 10:29.500
JOYCE, WHAT IS YOUR TITLE

10:27.433 --> 10:29.500
HERE?

10:29.500 --> 10:32.067
DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS.

10:29.500 --> 10:32.067
SO I OVERSEE ALL OF THE

10:32.067 --> 10:34.867
OPERATIONS.

10:32.067 --> 10:34.867
I'M BASICALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR

10:34.867 --> 10:36.967
EVERYTHING THAT TAKES PLACE ON

10:34.867 --> 10:36.967
THE PREMISES.

10:36.967 --> 10:38.900
IF YOU OWNED THE BUSINESS,

10:36.967 --> 10:38.900
WHAT WOULD YOU CHANGE IF YOU

10:38.900 --> 10:40.467
WERE ME?

10:38.900 --> 10:40.467
OH.

10:40.467 --> 10:42.600
ONE THING.

10:40.467 --> 10:42.600
DEFINITELY SALES IS WHAT

10:42.600 --> 10:45.233
CONCERNS ME THE MOST.

10:42.600 --> 10:45.233
DO YOU THINK JEN'S

10:42.600 --> 10:45.233
QUALIFIED

10:45.233 --> 10:48.000
TO RUN THAT SALES GROUP?

10:45.233 --> 10:48.000
YEAH?

10:48.000 --> 10:50.100
KIND OF?

10:48.000 --> 10:50.100
YOU KNOW, THIS IS ONLY THE

10:50.100 --> 10:51.667
THIRD TIME I'VE EVER MET HER.

10:50.100 --> 10:51.667
[chuckles]

10:51.667 --> 10:55.067
SO, TO BE HONEST, I HAVE NOT

10:51.667 --> 10:55.067
SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH HER.

10:55.067 --> 10:56.667
HOW MANY YEARS HAVE YOU

10:55.067 --> 10:56.667
BEEN

10:55.067 --> 10:56.667
HERE?

10:56.667 --> 10:58.200
FIVE YEARS.

10:56.667 --> 10:58.200
AND THIS IS ONLY THE THIRD

10:58.200 --> 10:59.767
TIME YOU'VE MET HER?

10:58.200 --> 10:59.767
CORRECT.

10:59.767 --> 11:02.200
THIS IS A SALES

10:59.767 --> 11:02.200
ORGANIZATION,

10:59.767 --> 11:02.200
RIGHT?

11:02.200 --> 11:03.900
YEAH.

11:02.200 --> 11:03.900
IT'S NOT ANYTHING ELSE, AND

11:03.900 --> 11:06.033
LIFE IS ABOUT SELLING.

11:03.900 --> 11:06.033
SO, IF YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR

11:03.900 --> 11:06.033
SALES

11:06.033 --> 11:07.467
STUFF IN ORDER...

11:06.033 --> 11:07.467
YEAH.

11:07.467 --> 11:09.267
THAT'S DEFINITELY THE

11:07.467 --> 11:09.267
NUMBER-ONE

11:07.467 --> 11:09.267
CONCERN.

11:09.267 --> 11:13.733
JOYCE HAS ONLY MET JEN

11:09.267 --> 11:13.733
THREE

11:09.267 --> 11:13.733
TIMES IN FIVE YEARS.

11:13.733 --> 11:16.600
HOW COULD YOU RUN A SALES

11:13.733 --> 11:16.600
ORGANIZATION FROM 3,000 MILES

11:16.600 --> 11:18.700
AWAY?

11:16.600 --> 11:18.700
IT SOUNDS TO ME THAT SALES

11:16.600 --> 11:18.700
ARE A

11:18.700 --> 11:21.000
MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM THAN

11:18.700 --> 11:21.000
I ORIGINALLY THOUGHT.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
YOUR ROLE IN THE COMPANY IS

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
THE

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
SALES.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.767
DO YOU THINK IT MATTERS THAT

11:23.000 --> 11:25.767
YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY IN

11:25.767 --> 11:27.533
CALIFORNIA WITH THE REST OF

11:25.767 --> 11:27.533
THE

11:25.767 --> 11:27.533
TEAM?

11:27.533 --> 11:28.933
YOU'RE IN NEW YORK.

11:27.533 --> 11:28.933
DO YOU THINK THAT MAKES A

11:28.933 --> 11:30.867
DIFFERENCE?

11:28.933 --> 11:30.867
NO.

11:30.867 --> 11:33.067
NO PROBLEM?

11:30.867 --> 11:33.067
NO.

11:33.067 --> 11:35.600
IT SEEMS ODD TO ME THAT

11:33.067 --> 11:35.600
SOMEBODY WOULD BE IN CHARGE OF

11:35.600 --> 11:38.333
SALES AND NOT BE WHERE THE

11:35.600 --> 11:38.333
PRODUCT IS AND NOT BE WHERE

11:35.600 --> 11:38.333
THE

11:38.333 --> 11:39.900
TEAM IS.

11:38.333 --> 11:39.900
DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE GOOD

11:38.333 --> 11:39.900
AT

11:39.900 --> 11:41.367
SALES?

11:39.900 --> 11:41.367
IS THIS SOMETHING THAT YOU

11:39.900 --> 11:41.367
FEEL

11:41.367 --> 11:42.867
LIKE IT'S A STRONG SUIT OF

11:41.367 --> 11:42.867
YOURS?

11:42.867 --> 11:46.133
YES, I DO!

11:42.867 --> 11:46.133
WHEN I GO TO DO THESE SHOWS

11:42.867 --> 11:46.133
AND

11:46.133 --> 11:50.967
I'M TALKING TO A BUYER, I

11:46.133 --> 11:50.967
COULD

11:46.133 --> 11:50.967
PRETTY MUCH HOLD ANY PRODUCT

11:46.133 --> 11:50.967
IN

11:50.967 --> 11:53.400
MY HAND AND SELL IT.

11:50.967 --> 11:53.400
ARE YOU FREAKED OUT A

11:50.967 --> 11:53.400
LITTLE

11:53.400 --> 11:57.167
BIT RIGHT NOW WITH WHERE THE

11:53.400 --> 11:57.167
COMPANY'S AT FINANCIALLY?

11:57.167 --> 12:00.100
UM, YEAH.

11:57.167 --> 12:00.100
I MEAN, IT'S JUST BEEN A

12:00.100 --> 12:05.067
TREMENDOUS ROLLER COASTER.

12:00.100 --> 12:05.067
IT'S JUST BEEN VERY DIFFICULT.

12:05.067 --> 12:08.033
LOOK, THERE ARE SOME FLAWS

12:05.067 --> 12:08.033
IN

12:05.067 --> 12:08.033
THIS BUSINESS, BUT I STILL

12:05.067 --> 12:08.033
LIKE

12:08.033 --> 12:10.467
THE PRODUCT.

12:08.033 --> 12:10.467
I'M GONNA GO IN AND TALK TO

12:10.467 --> 12:13.867
ROBIN, WHO APPEARS TO BE THE

12:10.467 --> 12:13.867
DECISION MAKER, TO SEE IF WE

12:10.467 --> 12:13.867
CAN

12:13.867 --> 12:17.833
CUT A DEAL TO SAVE ECO-ME.

12:13.867 --> 12:17.833
SO HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS.

12:17.833 --> 12:19.567
I BELIEVE IN THE PRODUCT.

12:17.833 --> 12:19.567
OKAY.

12:19.567 --> 12:22.367
I LOVE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

12:19.567 --> 12:22.367
HERE, BUT I THINK YOUR PROCESS

12:22.367 --> 12:25.633
IS TERRIBLE.

12:22.367 --> 12:25.633
I THINK YOU LACK EFFICIENCY

12:22.367 --> 12:25.633
AND

12:25.633 --> 12:27.533
EQUIPMENT.

12:25.633 --> 12:27.533
YOU ALSO NEED TO SELL MORE.

12:27.533 --> 12:30.533
SO HERE'S WHAT I HAVE IN MIND.

12:27.533 --> 12:30.533
NUMBER ONE, I WANT TO GET THIS

12:30.533 --> 12:32.967
COMPANY TO $10 MILLION IN

12:30.533 --> 12:32.967
SALES.

12:30.533 --> 12:32.967
NUMBER TWO, I WANT TO BE

12:32.967 --> 12:35.500
PROFITABLE IN A VERY SHORT

12:32.967 --> 12:35.500
PERIOD OF TIME.

12:35.500 --> 12:39.000
IT SOUNDS GREAT.

12:35.500 --> 12:39.000
I'M WILLING TO OFFER

12:35.500 --> 12:39.000
$500,000

12:39.000 --> 12:42.200
TO HELP THIS BUSINESS NOT ONLY

12:39.000 --> 12:42.200
SURVIVE, BUT SUCCEED.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.067
MM-HMM.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.067
I'LL FINANCE THE INVENTORY.

12:44.067 --> 12:46.733
I'LL FINANCE WHATEVER

12:44.067 --> 12:46.733
EQUIPMENT

12:44.067 --> 12:46.733
WE NEED FOR THE WAREHOUSE.

12:46.733 --> 12:51.300
I WILL PAY OFF THE DEBT AND

12:46.733 --> 12:51.300
FUND

12:46.733 --> 12:51.300
WORKING CAPITAL, BUT I WANT

12:46.733 --> 12:51.300
20%

12:51.300 --> 12:54.067
OF THE BUSINESS.

12:51.300 --> 12:54.067
THAT IS AN AWFUL DEAL.

12:54.067 --> 12:55.433
FOR WHO?

12:54.067 --> 12:55.433
FOR US.

12:55.433 --> 12:56.833
FOR ME?

12:55.433 --> 12:56.833
NO, YOU HAVE A GREAT DEAL!

12:56.833 --> 12:59.467
THAT'S A GREAT DEAL.

12:56.833 --> 12:59.467
YOU'RE CRAZY.

12:59.467 --> 13:02.400
YOU'RE ASKING ME TO GIVE UP

12:59.467 --> 13:02.400
20%

12:59.467 --> 13:02.400
OF THIS COMPANY, GIVE UP

13:02.400 --> 13:03.967
EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE WORKED

13:02.400 --> 13:03.967
FOR?

13:03.967 --> 13:05.700
YOU NEED MONEY.

13:03.967 --> 13:05.700
WE DO NEED MONEY.

13:05.700 --> 13:07.300
AND YOU NEED HELP.

13:05.700 --> 13:07.300
WE DO, BUT I WOULD SAY

13:07.300 --> 13:11.100
$250,000 IS EASILY WORTH 10%

13:07.300 --> 13:11.100
OF

13:07.300 --> 13:11.100
THE COMPANY, AND THAT GIVES

13:07.300 --> 13:11.100
YOU

13:11.100 --> 13:14.733
ENOUGH EQUITY IN THE COMPANY

13:11.100 --> 13:14.733
SO

13:11.100 --> 13:14.733
YOU FEEL SECURE THAT YOU'RE

13:11.100 --> 13:14.733
PART

13:14.733 --> 13:16.233
OF IT, BUT YOU'RE NOT TAKING--

13:14.733 --> 13:16.233
SO A COMPANY THAT DOES

13:16.233 --> 13:20.167
$500,000 A YEAR IN SALES AND

13:16.233 --> 13:20.167
LOSES $200,000 IS WORTH

13:20.167 --> 13:22.800
$2.5 MILLION TO YOU?

13:20.167 --> 13:22.800
THE VALUATION OF OUR

13:22.800 --> 13:24.167
COMPANY--

13:22.800 --> 13:24.167
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE

13:24.167 --> 13:25.500
VALUATION.

13:24.167 --> 13:25.500
YOU NEED MONEY.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.500
THIS IS MY CHILD.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.500
THIS IS MY COMPANY.

13:27.500 --> 13:29.500
IT'S EVERYTHING.

13:27.500 --> 13:29.500
I APPRECIATE HOW PERSONAL

13:27.500 --> 13:29.500
IT

13:29.500 --> 13:31.500
IS, BUT WITHOUT MY MONEY,

13:29.500 --> 13:31.500
THAT YOU LOVE--IT ALL WILL GO

13:31.500 --> 13:35.333
WITHOUT MY HELP, THIS BUSINESS

13:35.333 --> 13:40.133
AWAY VERY FAST.

13:35.333 --> 13:40.133
COMING UP...

13:40.133 --> 13:42.533
YOU CANNOT GET TO $1 MILLION,

13:40.133 --> 13:42.533
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOOD AT IT.

13:42.533 --> 13:44.100
NO, I AM GOOD AT IT.

13:42.533 --> 13:44.100
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

13:44.100 --> 13:45.333
THIS IS ABOUT PUTTING PEOPLE

13:44.100 --> 13:45.333
IN

13:45.333 --> 13:47.033
THE RIGHT PLACE.

13:47.033 --> 13:48.933
YOU ARE NOT A SALESPERSON.

13:55.600 --> 13:58.900
WITHOUT MY MONEY, WITHOUT

13:55.600 --> 13:58.900
MY

13:55.600 --> 13:58.900
HELP, THIS BUSINESS THAT YOU

13:58.900 --> 14:03.600
LOVE--IT ALL WILL GO AWAY VERY

13:58.900 --> 14:03.600
FAST.

14:03.600 --> 14:05.533
LOOK, ROBIN, THE DEAL IS VERY

14:03.600 --> 14:05.533
CLEAR TO ME.

14:05.533 --> 14:09.133
I WILL DO $250,000 IN DEBT...

14:05.533 --> 14:09.133
MM-HMM.

14:09.133 --> 14:11.033
WHICH MEANS THAT I'M

14:09.133 --> 14:11.033
ESSENTIALLY FUNDING THE

14:11.033 --> 14:12.367
EQUIPMENT...

14:11.033 --> 14:12.367
MM-HMM.

14:12.367 --> 14:14.300
AND FUNDING YOUR INVENTORY.

14:12.367 --> 14:14.300

14:14.300 --> 14:19.100
AND I WILL DO $250,000 IN

14:14.300 --> 14:19.100
EQUITY FOR 20%.

14:19.100 --> 14:23.067
THAT'S A TOTAL OF $500,000.

14:19.100 --> 14:23.067
THAT'S MY DEAL.

14:23.067 --> 14:28.033
THAT'S MY OFFER.

14:23.067 --> 14:28.033
TAKE IT, OR YOU LEAVE IT.

14:28.033 --> 14:30.900
EVERY INCH OF THIS

14:28.033 --> 14:30.900
BUSINESS,

14:28.033 --> 14:30.900
EVERY SECOND FROM BEGINNING TO

14:30.900 --> 14:33.767
END, IT'S ME, AND WHEN YOU

14:30.900 --> 14:33.767
SAY,

14:30.900 --> 14:33.767
LIKE, "OH, CAN YOU GIVE UP

14:33.767 --> 14:37.233
CONTROL OVER SOMETHING?"

14:33.767 --> 14:37.233
YEAH, I CAN, BUT I DON'T WANT

14:37.233 --> 14:39.733
TO.

14:37.233 --> 14:39.733
THIS BUSINESS IS IN MY BLOOD.

14:39.733 --> 14:43.200
SO, IF IT DOESN'T MAKE IT,

14:39.733 --> 14:43.200
IT'S

14:39.733 --> 14:43.200
DEVASTATING.

14:43.200 --> 14:45.600
I CANNOT IMAGINE A WORLD

14:43.200 --> 14:45.600
WITHOUT

14:43.200 --> 14:45.600
ECO-ME.

14:45.600 --> 14:50.367
I REALLY--I REALLY CAN'T.

14:45.600 --> 14:50.367
DO WE HAVE A DEAL?

14:50.367 --> 14:53.267

15:00.767 --> 15:02.700
YOU CAN'T FIRE ANY OF MY

15:00.767 --> 15:02.700
EMPLOYEES.

15:02.700 --> 15:05.633
BUT WHEN I TELL SOMEBODY

15:02.700 --> 15:05.633
THAT

15:02.700 --> 15:05.633
I'M IN CONTROL FOR A WEEK...

15:05.633 --> 15:07.000
MM-HMM.

15:05.633 --> 15:07.000
AND THEN THEY START

15:07.000 --> 15:09.667
BACKPEDALING AND TELLING ME,

15:07.000 --> 15:09.667
"WELL, BUT YOU CAN'T DO THIS,

15:09.667 --> 15:11.533
AND YOU CAN'T DO THAT, AND YOU

15:09.667 --> 15:11.533
CAN'T DO THIS"...

15:11.533 --> 15:14.167
I JUST HAD ONE STIPULATION.

15:11.533 --> 15:14.167
I KNOW, AND I'M SAYING NO.

15:14.167 --> 15:15.900
YEAH, BUT WE'VE JUST MET.

15:14.167 --> 15:15.900
BUT I'M JUST GIVING YOU

15:15.900 --> 15:18.667
$500,000, AND I'M ASKING YOU

15:15.900 --> 15:18.667
TO

15:15.900 --> 15:18.667
TRUST ME AFTER I TOLD YOU

15:18.667 --> 15:20.367
I WOULD TRUST YOU.

15:18.667 --> 15:20.367
BUT I'M TURNING OVER MY

15:20.367 --> 15:21.833
ENTIRE--MY CHILD.

15:20.367 --> 15:21.833
FOR A WEEK.

15:21.833 --> 15:23.167
MY CHILD.

15:21.833 --> 15:23.167
BUT FOR A WEEK.

15:23.167 --> 15:24.667
BUT FOR A WEEK.

15:23.167 --> 15:24.667
I'M BABYSITTING FOR A WEEK.

15:24.667 --> 15:26.033
I KNOW.

15:24.667 --> 15:26.033
LET ME TELL YOU THE THOUGHT

15:26.033 --> 15:28.233
PROCESS BEHIND THE EMPLOYEES.

15:26.033 --> 15:28.233
YOU COME IN, NOT EMOTIONAL.

15:28.233 --> 15:30.800
IT'S NOT YOUR BABY YET, AND

15:28.233 --> 15:30.800
YOU

15:28.233 --> 15:30.800
SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:30.800 --> 15:33.967
SO-AND-SO MIGHT BE BETTER IN A

15:30.800 --> 15:33.967
DIFFERENT POSITION, AND I

15:30.800 --> 15:33.967
DON'T

15:33.967 --> 15:35.800
KNOW IF WE'RE READY FOR THAT

15:33.967 --> 15:35.800
POSITION 'CAUSE I MIGHT WANT

15:33.967 --> 15:35.800
TO

15:35.800 --> 15:37.700
OUTSOURCE THAT."

15:35.800 --> 15:37.700
IT'S A BUSINESS, ROBIN.

15:37.700 --> 15:39.333
OF COURSE IT'S A BUSINESS,

15:37.700 --> 15:39.333
BUT THESE ARE PEOPLE'S

15:39.333 --> 15:41.467
LIVELIHOODS.

15:39.333 --> 15:41.467
SO YOU EITHER TRUST ME OR

15:41.467 --> 15:44.867
YOU DON'T, AND IF YOU CAN'T DO

15:41.467 --> 15:44.867
IT FOR A WEEK, I CAN'T DO THE

15:44.867 --> 15:49.333
DEAL.

15:44.867 --> 15:49.333
HEAR ME OUT FOR A SECOND,

15:44.867 --> 15:49.333
OKAY?

15:49.333 --> 15:50.667
OKAY.

15:49.333 --> 15:50.667
FOR ME TO GIVE YOU

15:50.667 --> 15:52.533
$500,000...

15:50.667 --> 15:52.533
MM-HMM.

15:52.533 --> 15:56.067
THAT TRUST HAS TO BE REALLY

15:52.533 --> 15:56.067
EARNED OVER A COURSE OF A

15:52.533 --> 15:56.067
WEEK.

15:56.067 --> 15:57.867
AND WHEN THE WEEK IS

15:56.067 --> 15:57.867
OVER...

15:56.067 --> 15:57.867
MM-HMM.

15:57.867 --> 15:59.500
THE KEYS ARE BACK TO ME?

15:57.867 --> 15:59.500
YES.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.633
OKAY.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.633
BUT AT THE END OF THE WEEK,

16:01.633 --> 16:04.967
IF YOU DON'T DO WHAT YOU SAY

16:01.633 --> 16:04.967
YOU'RE GONNA DO...

16:04.967 --> 16:07.100
MM-HMM.

16:04.967 --> 16:07.100
AND YOU DON'T FOLLOW

16:04.967 --> 16:07.100
THROUGH,

16:07.100 --> 16:11.433
MY $500,000 AND ME WILL BOTH

16:07.100 --> 16:11.433
EVAPORATE.

16:11.433 --> 16:14.033
OKAY.

16:11.433 --> 16:14.033
OKAY.

16:14.033 --> 16:17.867
SO MAKE IT OUT TO "ECO-ME"?

16:14.033 --> 16:17.867
ECO-ME.

16:17.867 --> 16:19.267
WE HAVE A DEAL.

16:17.867 --> 16:19.267
OKAY.

16:19.267 --> 16:22.033
THANK YOU.

16:19.267 --> 16:22.033
WOW.

16:22.033 --> 16:23.667
THAT'S CRAZY.

16:22.033 --> 16:23.667
THAT'S A REAL CHECK.

16:23.667 --> 16:25.833
[laughs]

16:23.667 --> 16:25.833
IT'S A VERY REAL CHECK.

16:25.833 --> 16:28.033
YEAH.

16:25.833 --> 16:28.033
IT'S EXCITING, BUT IT'S A

16:25.833 --> 16:28.033
LITTLE

16:28.033 --> 16:31.467
BIT UNNERVING.

16:28.033 --> 16:31.467
HE'S GOT SOME REALLY GOOD

16:28.033 --> 16:31.467
IDEAS,

16:31.467 --> 16:33.367
BUT HE HAS SOME IDEAS THAT

16:31.467 --> 16:33.367
I KNOW WE'RE GONNA BUTT HEADS

16:33.367 --> 16:37.200
ON, AND I HAVE CONCERNS,

16:33.367 --> 16:37.200
OBVIOUSLY, BUT WE DO NEED THE

16:37.200 --> 16:39.667
HELP.

16:37.200 --> 16:39.667
HEY, EVERYBODY, CAN I BORROW

16:37.200 --> 16:39.667
YOU

16:39.667 --> 16:41.267
FOR A SEC?

16:39.667 --> 16:41.267
GOOD MORNING.

16:41.267 --> 16:42.600
GOOD MORNING, MARCUS.

16:41.267 --> 16:42.600
MORNING.

16:42.600 --> 16:44.000
IF YOU COULD STAND OVER

16:42.600 --> 16:44.000
THERE

16:42.600 --> 16:44.000
WITH THE TEAM, THAT WOULD BE

16:44.000 --> 16:46.167
GREAT--THANK YOU.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.167
I'VE HAD A CHANCE TO MEET ALL

16:44.000 --> 16:46.167
OF

16:46.167 --> 16:48.500
YOU THIS MORNING.

16:46.167 --> 16:48.500
I WANTED TO TELL YOU THAT

16:46.167 --> 16:48.500
ROBIN

16:48.500 --> 16:51.600
AND I HAVE CUT A DEAL TO BE IN

16:48.500 --> 16:51.600
BUSINESS TOGETHER.

16:51.600 --> 16:53.533
I'VE COMMITTED TO PUT A HALF A

16:51.600 --> 16:53.533
MILLION DOLLARS IN YOUR

16:53.533 --> 16:55.533
BUSINESS.

16:53.533 --> 16:55.533
[claps]

16:55.533 --> 16:57.933
WOW.

16:55.533 --> 16:57.933
NOW, I KNOW THAT THE

16:55.533 --> 16:57.933
PROCESS

16:57.933 --> 17:00.300
IS BROKEN AND THE PRODUCT

16:57.933 --> 17:00.300
NEEDS

16:57.933 --> 17:00.300
SOME TWEAKING.

17:00.300 --> 17:03.100
THE PACKAGING IS BAD.

17:00.300 --> 17:03.100
BUT IT'S THE PEOPLE PROCESS

17:03.100 --> 17:05.700
I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

17:03.100 --> 17:05.700
THIS SALES TEAM--IT'S THE

17:05.700 --> 17:08.833
BIGGEST PROBLEM I SEE.

17:05.700 --> 17:08.833
ALL OF YOU HAVE A LOT TO LOSE,

17:08.833 --> 17:12.032
BUT IF WE EXECUTE ON THE

17:08.833 --> 17:12.032
THINGS

17:08.833 --> 17:12.032
THAT I'M TELLING YOU WE NEED

17:08.833 --> 17:12.032
TO

17:12.032 --> 17:16.032
DO, WE WILL GO FROM $500,000

17:12.032 --> 17:16.032
IN

17:12.032 --> 17:16.032
SALES TO $10 MILLION IN SALES.

17:16.032 --> 17:19.200
ECO-ME IS A GREAT PRODUCT.

17:16.032 --> 17:19.200
I LOVE IT.

17:19.200 --> 17:21.800
BUT IT'S POORLY, POORLY

17:19.200 --> 17:21.800
MARKETED.

17:21.800 --> 17:24.467
THE PACKAGING IS BAD.

17:21.800 --> 17:24.467
THE MERCHANDISING IS BAD.

17:24.467 --> 17:27.733
WE'RE GONNA REDO ALL OF IT.

17:24.467 --> 17:27.733
I DON'T WANT TO BE IN ONE

17:24.467 --> 17:27.733
STORE

17:27.733 --> 17:30.300
ON ONE SHELF.

17:27.733 --> 17:30.300
I WANT TO BE IN EVERY STORE ON

17:30.300 --> 17:33.000
EVERY SHELF.

17:30.300 --> 17:33.000
THE STRENGTH OF ANY

17:30.300 --> 17:33.000
ORGANIZATION

17:33.000 --> 17:36.700
IS ABOUT ITS PEOPLE, AND IN

17:33.000 --> 17:36.700
THIS

17:33.000 --> 17:36.700
ORGANIZATION, IT'S ABOUT ITS

17:36.700 --> 17:40.000
SALESPEOPLE.

17:36.700 --> 17:40.000
CAN JEN ACTUALLY HANDLE THIS

17:40.000 --> 17:42.800
JOB?

17:40.000 --> 17:42.800
CAN SHE DO IT FROM 3,000 MILES

17:42.800 --> 17:46.000
AWAY?

17:42.800 --> 17:46.000
I'M NOT SURE.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.967
AND LASTLY, OUR SUPPLY CHAIN

17:46.000 --> 17:48.967
IS

17:46.000 --> 17:48.967
BROKEN.

17:48.967 --> 17:51.800
WE NEED TO IMPROVE THE

17:48.967 --> 17:51.800
PROCESS.

17:48.967 --> 17:51.800
WE CAN'T USE A MACHINE THAT

17:48.967 --> 17:51.800
HAS

17:51.800 --> 17:54.800
A MAXIMUM CAPACITY OF 1,200

17:51.800 --> 17:54.800
BOTTLES A DAY.

17:54.800 --> 17:58.167
I'M GONNA INVEST IN EQUIPMENT

17:54.800 --> 17:58.167
THAT CAN TURN OUT 1,200

17:54.800 --> 17:58.167
BOTTLES

17:58.167 --> 18:00.733
IN 20 MINUTES.

17:58.167 --> 18:00.733
THIS WILL INCREASE PRODUCTION

18:00.733 --> 18:02.000
IMMEDIATELY AND PUT US ON THE

18:00.733 --> 18:02.000
WHAT?

18:02.000 --> 18:05.733
PATH TO GENERATE $10 MILLION

18:02.000 --> 18:05.733
IN

18:02.000 --> 18:05.733
SALES ANNUALLY.

18:05.733 --> 18:07.767
FOR THE NEXT WEEK, I HAVE

18:05.733 --> 18:07.767
COMPLETE CONTROL OF THE

18:07.767 --> 18:11.233
BUSINESS, 100% CONTROL.

18:07.767 --> 18:11.233
ANYBODY CAN BE FIRED.

18:11.233 --> 18:13.767
ANYBODY CAN BE DEMOTED.

18:11.233 --> 18:13.767
ANYBODY CAN BE PROMOTED.

18:13.767 --> 18:16.400
WHATEVER IT IS THAT I WANT TO

18:13.767 --> 18:16.400
DO, I'M GONNA DO.

18:16.400 --> 18:18.567
DOES ANYBODY HAVE A PROBLEM

18:16.400 --> 18:18.567
WITH

18:16.400 --> 18:18.567
THAT?

18:18.567 --> 18:20.867
'CAUSE TODAY IS THE DAY TO

18:18.567 --> 18:20.867
LEAVE

18:18.567 --> 18:20.867
IF YOU DO.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.700
NO.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.700
SO, IF YOU'RE READY TO GO

18:20.867 --> 18:22.700
TO

18:22.700 --> 18:25.333
WORK, I'M READY TO START.

18:22.700 --> 18:25.333
ABSOLUTELY.

18:25.333 --> 18:26.000
WE'RE READY.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.233
THANK YOU.

18:27.233 --> 18:28.267
GOOD LUCK.

18:28.267 --> 18:31.233
IT'S GONNA BE A BUMPY RIDE.

18:33.833 --> 18:36.333
THE FIRST THING I'M GONNA

18:33.833 --> 18:36.333
DO

18:33.833 --> 18:36.333
IS GET ECO-ME'S EQUIPMENT UP

18:33.833 --> 18:36.333
TO

18:36.333 --> 18:37.667
DATE.

18:36.333 --> 18:37.667
THIS IS WHERE WE MAKE

18:37.667 --> 18:40.367
HIGH-SPEED EQUIPMENT.

18:37.667 --> 18:40.367
I'M TAKING ROBIN AND JEN

18:37.667 --> 18:40.367
DOWN

18:40.367 --> 18:44.300
TO ACCUTEK, ONE OF THE PREMIER

18:40.367 --> 18:44.300
COMPANIES THAT PRODUCES

18:40.367 --> 18:44.300
BOTTLING

18:44.300 --> 18:49.667
EQUIPMENT.

18:44.300 --> 18:49.667
SO THIS IS THE MACHINE.

18:49.667 --> 18:51.800
THIS IS THE SAME TYPE OF HEAD

18:49.667 --> 18:51.800
RIGHT NOW THAT I THINK YOU

18:49.667 --> 18:51.800
HAVE,

18:51.800 --> 18:53.133
RIGHT?

18:51.800 --> 18:53.133
YEP.

18:53.133 --> 18:54.500
THIS IS A NECK GRABBER.

18:53.133 --> 18:54.500
WHAT IT DOES, IT ENSURES THAT

18:54.500 --> 18:56.767
THE BOTTLE NECK IS CENTERED TO

18:54.500 --> 18:56.767
THE NOZZLE SO YOU DON'T

18:56.767 --> 18:58.900
ACCIDENTALLY CRASH IN BETWEEN

18:56.767 --> 18:58.900
BOTTLES.

18:58.900 --> 19:01.400
RIGHT, OKAY.

18:58.900 --> 19:01.400
YOU COULD DO 60, 70 A

18:58.900 --> 19:01.400
MINUTE

19:01.400 --> 19:02.733
ON THIS...

19:01.400 --> 19:02.733
WOW!

19:02.733 --> 19:04.100
WITHOUT EVEN THINKING ABOUT

19:02.733 --> 19:04.100
IT.

19:04.100 --> 19:05.733
SO WHERE DO THE LABELS GO

19:04.100 --> 19:05.733
ON?

19:04.100 --> 19:05.733
AFTER THE BOTTLE'S BEEN

19:05.733 --> 19:08.733
CAPPED--WE'LL SEND ONE THROUGH

19:05.733 --> 19:08.733
HERE, AND THEN IT'S GONNA

19:05.733 --> 19:08.733
TRAVEL

19:08.733 --> 19:13.567
DOWN HERE THROUGH THE LABELING

19:08.733 --> 19:13.567
MACHINE, AND THAT WILL--LET ME

19:13.567 --> 19:14.900
CATCH THAT BOTTLE.

19:13.567 --> 19:14.900
OH, MY GOD.

19:14.900 --> 19:16.733
WHOA, THAT WAS AWESOME!

19:14.900 --> 19:16.733
OH, MY GOD!

19:16.733 --> 19:19.333
[laughter]

19:16.733 --> 19:19.333
GETTING THIS EQUIPMENT WILL

19:19.333 --> 19:23.433
IMMEDIATELY IMPROVE THE

19:19.333 --> 19:23.433
PRODUCTION BY 24 TIMES, WHICH

19:23.433 --> 19:26.567
MEANS THAT THEY'LL BE ABLE TO

19:23.433 --> 19:26.567
PRODUCE AS MANY AS 30,000

19:26.567 --> 19:30.000
BOTTLES IN A SINGLE DAY.

19:26.567 --> 19:30.000
WE NEED MORE BUSINESS, LIKE,

19:30.000 --> 19:31.733
YESTERDAY.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.733
YEAH.

19:31.733 --> 19:34.133
WE BETTER SELL MORE, AND IF

19:31.733 --> 19:34.133
YOU DON'T, I'M GONNA FIND

19:34.133 --> 19:37.467
SOMEBODY WHO CAN, 'CAUSE THIS

19:34.133 --> 19:37.467
$180,000 MACHINE IS GONNA

19:37.467 --> 19:41.000
REQUIRE US TO SELL ABOUT

19:37.467 --> 19:41.000
$4 MILLION OR $5 MILLION

19:41.000 --> 19:43.600
IMMEDIATELY, JUST TO MAKE THIS

19:41.000 --> 19:43.600
THING MAKE SENSE.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.167
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.167

19:47.833 --> 19:51.633
YEAH, NICE MEETING WITH

19:47.833 --> 19:51.633
YOU.

19:47.833 --> 19:51.633
EVERYTHING IS CODED AND

19:51.633 --> 19:53.700
DATED.

19:51.633 --> 19:53.700
CONNIE AND KELLY ARE MY TWO

19:53.700 --> 19:57.067
LEAD BUYERS FROM CAMPING

19:53.700 --> 19:57.067
WORLD,

19:53.700 --> 19:57.067
PRODUCT

19:57.067 --> 20:00.800

19:57.067 --> 20:00.800
I'M CONFIDENT THAT IF JEN CAN

20:00.800 --> 20:03.867
CONVINCE KELLY AND CONNIE TO

20:00.800 --> 20:03.867
THE PRODUCT, SHE'LL BE ABLE TO

20:03.867 --> 20:06.067
CONVINCE ANYBODY.

20:03.867 --> 20:06.067
BOO!

20:06.067 --> 20:08.233
IT'S US.

20:06.067 --> 20:08.233
HI.

20:08.233 --> 20:08.933
HOW ARE YOU?

20:08.233 --> 20:08.933
SCARY.

20:08.933 --> 20:11.267
GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?

20:08.933 --> 20:11.267
THIS IS CONNIE AND KELLY.

20:11.267 --> 20:13.167
THEY'RE MY TWO LEAD BUYERS.

20:11.267 --> 20:13.167
HI. NICE TO MEET YOU.

20:13.167 --> 20:14.500
JEN.

20:13.167 --> 20:14.500
HI.

20:14.500 --> 20:16.700
NICE TO MEET YOU.

20:14.500 --> 20:16.700
THEY SEE ABOUT 600 VENDORS

20:14.500 --> 20:16.700
A

20:16.700 --> 20:18.967
YEAR, AND THEY KNOW THAT

20:16.700 --> 20:18.967
THEY'RE

20:16.700 --> 20:18.967
TALKING TO ABOUT 6 MILLION

20:18.967 --> 20:20.400
CUSTOMERS.

20:18.967 --> 20:20.400
MM-HMM.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.433
SO, JEN, IF YOU CAN SHOW

20:20.400 --> 20:22.433
THEM

20:20.400 --> 20:22.433
SOME PRODUCTS, THAT WOULD BE

20:22.433 --> 20:23.767
GREAT.

20:22.433 --> 20:23.767
SURE. OKAY.

20:23.767 --> 20:24.633
HEY, ROBIN, CAN I SHOW YOU

20:23.767 --> 20:24.633
OKAY.

20:24.633 --> 20:26.533
SOMETHING INSIDE REAL QUICK?

20:24.633 --> 20:26.533
IN KINDERGARTEN, AND WE GREW

20:24.633 --> 20:26.533
UP

20:26.533 --> 20:30.233
I'LL JUST START.

20:26.533 --> 20:30.233
SO ROBIN AND I MET WHEN WE

20:26.533 --> 20:30.233
WERE

20:30.233 --> 20:32.400
TOGETHER.

20:30.233 --> 20:32.400
WE CAME TOGETHER BASED ON A

20:32.400 --> 20:34.400
NEED.

20:32.400 --> 20:34.400
THE NEED IS TO REMOVE HARMFUL

20:34.400 --> 20:37.033
CHEMICALS FROM OUR HOMES THAT

20:34.400 --> 20:37.033
WE

20:34.400 --> 20:37.033
USE EVERY SINGLE DAY.

20:37.033 --> 20:40.033
WE WANTED TO GROUP EVERYTHING

20:37.033 --> 20:40.033
TOGETHER AS OUR FAMILY LINE OF

20:40.033 --> 20:42.833
PRODUCTS.

20:40.033 --> 20:42.833
THAT WAS OUR INITIAL

20:40.033 --> 20:42.833
INTENT--TO

20:42.833 --> 20:46.333
MIX UP VERY NATURAL PRODUCTS

20:42.833 --> 20:46.333
FOR

20:42.833 --> 20:46.333
YOU AND YOUR FAMILY.

20:46.333 --> 20:48.233
JEN, CAN I INTERRUPT YOU

20:46.333 --> 20:48.233
JUST

20:46.333 --> 20:48.233
FOR A MOMENT?

20:48.233 --> 20:49.633
SURE.

20:48.233 --> 20:49.633
WHEN I LOOK AT YOUR

20:48.233 --> 20:49.633
PRODUCT,

20:49.633 --> 20:51.733
I SEE "ECO-ME..."

20:49.633 --> 20:51.733
MM-HMM.

20:51.733 --> 20:53.167
"ALL-PURPOSE CLEANER."

20:51.733 --> 20:53.167
MM-HMM.

20:53.167 --> 20:55.033
BUT IT DOESN'T TELL ME WHAT

20:53.167 --> 20:55.033
IT CLEANS.

20:55.033 --> 20:57.800
WELL, YOU KNOW, WE'RE

20:55.033 --> 20:57.800
SAYING

20:55.033 --> 20:57.800
THAT IT'S ALL-PURPOSE.

20:57.800 --> 21:00.733
I MEAN, IT REALLY CAN CLEAN

20:57.800 --> 21:00.733
ALMOST EVERYTHING IN YOUR

20:57.800 --> 21:00.733
HOME.

21:00.733 --> 21:03.733
WOOD?

21:00.733 --> 21:03.733
NOT WOOD.

21:03.733 --> 21:05.133
OKAY, SEE?

21:03.733 --> 21:05.133
RIGHT. MM-HMM.

21:05.133 --> 21:08.200
IT KILLS GERMS AND BACTERIA.

21:05.133 --> 21:08.200
IS THAT ON THERE?

21:08.200 --> 21:10.033
YEAH.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.033
I MEAN, OUR VINEGAR DOES.

21:10.033 --> 21:13.167
IT SAYS IT IN THE LABELING.

21:10.033 --> 21:13.167
DOES IT SMELL VINEGAR-Y?

21:13.167 --> 21:15.233
NO.

21:13.167 --> 21:15.233
WE WORKED VERY HARD ON THAT AS

21:15.233 --> 21:17.433
WELL.

21:15.233 --> 21:17.433
I SMELL THE VINEGAR.

21:17.433 --> 21:19.233
HOW ARE YOU GONNA COMPETE

21:17.433 --> 21:19.233
IN

21:17.433 --> 21:19.233
THE MARKET?

21:19.233 --> 21:21.967
I MEAN, 'CAUSE YOU REALLY

21:19.233 --> 21:21.967
CAN'T

21:19.233 --> 21:21.967
TELL ME ABOUT YOUR PRODUCT, OF

21:21.967 --> 21:23.733
REALLY WHAT IT DOES.

21:21.967 --> 21:23.733
YES, WE CAN.

21:23.733 --> 21:25.567
WE JUST HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT

21:23.733 --> 21:25.567
HOW

21:23.733 --> 21:25.567
TO DO THAT YET.

21:25.567 --> 21:26.967
WELL, WHEN ARE YOU GONNA

21:25.567 --> 21:26.967
FIGURE IT OUT?

21:26.967 --> 21:29.600
WE'RE WORKING ON IT NOW.

21:26.967 --> 21:29.600
I SEE "DAVE," AND I DON'T

21:29.600 --> 21:31.467
REALLY UNDERSTAND WHO DAVE IS.

21:29.600 --> 21:31.467
MM-HMM.

21:31.467 --> 21:33.567
WHO IS PHIL, DAVE, MATT,

21:31.467 --> 21:33.567
AND

21:31.467 --> 21:33.567
EMMA?

21:33.567 --> 21:34.933
I MEAN--

21:33.567 --> 21:34.933
THEY'RE OUR FRIENDS AND

21:34.933 --> 21:37.733
FAMILY, BASICALLY, AND THEY'RE

21:34.933 --> 21:37.733
SUPPOSED TO REPLACE YOUR

21:34.933 --> 21:37.733
FRIENDS

21:37.733 --> 21:39.533
AND FAMILY IN YOUR--

21:37.733 --> 21:39.533
I THINK WE'RE MISSING IT A

21:39.533 --> 21:40.867
LITTLE THERE.

21:39.533 --> 21:40.867
MM-HMM.

21:40.867 --> 21:42.733
THIS IS BROKE FOR OUR

21:40.867 --> 21:42.733
STORES

21:40.867 --> 21:42.733
AS FAR AS PACKAGING GOES.

21:42.733 --> 21:44.900
IT IS BROKE.

21:42.733 --> 21:44.900
I DON'T FEEL THAT YOU'RE READY

21:44.900 --> 21:48.200
AT ALL, AND THEN WHEN I'M

21:44.900 --> 21:48.200
ASKING

21:44.900 --> 21:48.200
YOU ABOUT YOUR PRODUCT, I

21:44.900 --> 21:48.200
DIDN'T

21:48.200 --> 21:51.133
GET A GOOD CLEAR ANSWER AS

21:48.200 --> 21:51.133
TO--

21:48.200 --> 21:51.133
YOU WOULD HAVE IF I KNEW

21:48.200 --> 21:51.133
THAT

21:51.133 --> 21:54.500
I WAS MEETING WITH YOU TODAY.

21:51.133 --> 21:54.500
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY I DO MY...

21:54.500 --> 21:56.300
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:54.500 --> 21:56.300
RESEARCH WHEN I COME

21:56.300 --> 21:57.633
PREPARED.

21:56.300 --> 21:57.633
I'M SORRY.

21:57.633 --> 22:01.667
YOU HAVE TO BE READY, OR

21:57.633 --> 22:01.667
YOU'RE

21:57.633 --> 22:01.667
NOT EVEN GONNA GET AN

21:57.633 --> 22:01.667
AUDIENCE.

22:01.667 --> 22:03.767
THAT'S HOW IT ROLLS IN RETAIL.

22:03.767 --> 22:07.800
I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT YOU CAN

22:03.767 --> 22:07.800
DO IT.

22:07.800 --> 22:10.467
COMING UP...

22:07.800 --> 22:10.467
THIS WOULD BE WHAT OUR MODEL

22:10.467 --> 22:12.300
WOULD LOOK LIKE.

22:10.467 --> 22:12.300
I REALLY DON'T LIKE THE

22:12.300 --> 22:14.033
COLORS.

22:12.300 --> 22:14.033
ROBIN, I DON'T GIVE A CRAP

22:14.033 --> 22:16.633
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

22:14.033 --> 22:16.633
WHAT I CARE ABOUT IS IT SELLS,

22:16.633 --> 22:19.900
AND THAT ISN'T SELLING.

22:16.633 --> 22:19.900
AND LATER...

22:19.900 --> 22:21.667
I'M NOT WILLING TO DO THE DEAL

22:21.667 --> 22:23.900
IF YOU'RE IN CHARGE OF SALES.

22:27.733 --> 22:29.133
THANK YOU, LADIES, FOR

22:27.733 --> 22:29.133
STOPPING BY.

22:29.133 --> 22:30.467
THANK YOU.

22:29.133 --> 22:30.467
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

22:30.467 --> 22:33.367
THANK YOU.

22:30.467 --> 22:33.367
THANK YOU.

22:33.367 --> 22:36.033
THANK YOU.

22:33.367 --> 22:36.033
SO I THINK THE TAKEAWAY IS,

22:36.033 --> 22:40.300
IF WE'RE GONNA GO FROM

22:36.033 --> 22:40.300
$500,000

22:36.033 --> 22:40.300
TO $10 MILLION, WE BETTER BE

22:40.300 --> 22:42.633
PREPARED.

22:40.300 --> 22:42.633
YOU CANNOT GET TO $1 MILLION,

22:42.633 --> 22:45.300
'CAUSE WE'RE NOT SELLING

22:42.633 --> 22:45.300
ENOUGH,

22:42.633 --> 22:45.300
ENOUGH IS BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT

22:45.300 --> 22:47.733
GOOD AT IT.

22:45.300 --> 22:47.733
NO, I AM GOOD AT IT.

22:47.733 --> 22:49.567
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

22:47.733 --> 22:49.567
YES, I AM.

22:49.567 --> 22:50.900
YES, SHE IS.

22:49.567 --> 22:50.900
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

22:50.900 --> 22:51.567
YES, SHE IS.

22:50.900 --> 22:51.567
AND THE REASON WE'RE NOT

22:50.900 --> 22:51.567
SELLING

22:51.567 --> 22:53.200
MARCUS, SHE HAS GROWN THIS

22:51.567 --> 22:53.200
COMPANY.

22:53.200 --> 22:54.633
IT'S DISRESPECTFUL.

22:53.200 --> 22:54.633
IT'S TOTALLY DISRESPECTFUL.

22:54.633 --> 22:56.000
IT'S NOT DISRESPECTFUL.

22:54.633 --> 22:56.000
IT IS!

22:56.000 --> 22:57.500
OF COURSE IT IS!

22:56.000 --> 22:57.500
TO JUST SAY I'M NOT GOOD AT

22:57.500 --> 22:59.500
IT--THAT'S A BUNCH OF B.S.

22:57.500 --> 22:59.500
NO, IT'S NOT.

22:59.500 --> 23:01.167
THAT'S A BUNCH OF CRAP, AND

22:59.500 --> 23:01.167
IT'S RUDE.

23:01.167 --> 23:02.667
NO, IT'S NOT RUDE.

23:01.167 --> 23:02.667
IT'S RUDE, AND IF YOU WANT

23:01.167 --> 23:02.667
TO

23:02.667 --> 23:04.167
BE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH US, WE

23:02.667 --> 23:04.167
CAN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF

23:04.167 --> 23:06.000
RELATIONSHIP.

23:04.167 --> 23:06.000
YOU'RE NOW DISRESPECTING MY

23:06.000 --> 23:09.300
PARTNER WHO HELPED ME BUILD

23:06.000 --> 23:09.300
THIS

23:06.000 --> 23:09.300
BUSINESS, AND IT'S NOT OKAY,

23:06.000 --> 23:09.300
AND

23:09.300 --> 23:11.367
I WILL FIGHT YOU BACK ON THAT,

23:09.300 --> 23:11.367
'CAUSE I THINK SHE DESERVES AN

23:11.367 --> 23:12.867
APOLOGY.

23:11.367 --> 23:12.867
IT'S NOT ABOUT A

23:11.367 --> 23:12.867
FRIENDSHIP.

23:12.867 --> 23:15.233
IT'S A BUSINESS.

23:12.867 --> 23:15.233
IT'S A PERSON AND THEIR JOB

23:15.233 --> 23:17.300
AND THEIR ROLE, SO IT IS

23:15.233 --> 23:17.300
DISRESPECTFUL.

23:17.300 --> 23:18.700
SO WHAT DID I DO TO HER

23:17.300 --> 23:18.700
THAT

23:17.300 --> 23:18.700
WAS DISRESPECTFUL?

23:18.700 --> 23:20.367
YOU JUST TOLD ME I WASN'T

23:18.700 --> 23:20.367
GOOD AT SOMETHING THAT I'VE

23:18.700 --> 23:20.367
BEEN

23:20.367 --> 23:22.800
DOING FOR SIX YEARS.

23:20.367 --> 23:22.800
REALLY?

23:22.800 --> 23:24.367
QUARTERBACKS GET CUT ALL

23:22.800 --> 23:24.367
THE

23:22.800 --> 23:24.367
TIME.

23:24.367 --> 23:27.100
THIS ISN'T THAT SITUATION.

23:24.367 --> 23:27.100
IT'S A BUSINESS.

23:27.100 --> 23:28.333
THIS IS ABOUT PUTTING PEOPLE

23:27.100 --> 23:28.333
IN

23:28.333 --> 23:30.100
THE RIGHT PLACE.

23:30.100 --> 23:32.900
YOU ARE NOT A SALESPERSON.

23:38.000 --> 23:42.233
CAMPING WORLD, HERE WE

23:38.000 --> 23:42.233
COME!

23:38.000 --> 23:42.233
I INVITED THE ECO-ME TEAM

23:38.000 --> 23:42.233
TO

23:42.233 --> 23:45.433
ONE OF MY CAMPING WORLD STORES

23:42.233 --> 23:45.433
TO SET UP A DISPLAY ON THE

23:42.233 --> 23:45.433
FLOOR

23:45.433 --> 23:48.100
AND SELL THEIR PRODUCTS.

23:45.433 --> 23:48.100
I WANTED TO SEE WHAT KIND OF

23:48.100 --> 23:50.267
REACTION POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS

23:48.100 --> 23:50.267
WOULD GIVE THEM.

23:50.267 --> 23:54.467
SO I'M GONNA INTRODUCE YOU TO

23:50.267 --> 23:54.467
JOHNNY, WHO HANDLES BUSINESS

23:54.467 --> 23:57.033
DEVELOPMENT FOR ME ACROSS ALL

23:54.467 --> 23:57.033
MY

23:54.467 --> 23:57.033
BUSINESSES.

23:57.033 --> 23:59.567
ALL RIGHT, COME ON OVER.

23:57.033 --> 23:59.567
YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND SET UP.

23:59.567 --> 24:02.067
WE'LL SEE HOW YOU MERCHANDISE

23:59.567 --> 24:02.067
IT, AND NOW WE NEED TO SEE

23:59.567 --> 24:02.067
WHAT

24:02.067 --> 24:03.200
OUR CUSTOMERS THINK OF IT,

24:02.067 --> 24:03.200
OKAY?

24:03.200 --> 24:03.867
ALL RIGHT, EXCELLENT.

24:03.867 --> 24:07.633
LET'S DO THIS!

24:07.633 --> 24:10.400
[metal clangs]

24:14.067 --> 24:16.000
THIS COMES OUT.

24:14.067 --> 24:16.000
I JUST DON'T WANT TO BREAK MY

24:16.000 --> 24:22.200
NAIL.

24:16.000 --> 24:22.200
OOPS, SORRY.

24:22.200 --> 24:24.133
THIS LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING

24:22.200 --> 24:24.133
YOU

24:22.200 --> 24:24.133
BOUGHT AT IKEA.

24:24.133 --> 24:28.333
THIS IS SOMETHING WE BOUGHT

24:24.133 --> 24:28.333
AT IKEA.

24:28.333 --> 24:31.967
OKAY, I'M ONE SCREW SHORT.

24:28.333 --> 24:31.967
YOU KNOW, ROBIN--

24:31.967 --> 24:35.267
I DIDN'T REALIZE ALL THIS

24:31.967 --> 24:35.267
WAS

24:31.967 --> 24:35.267
GONNA BE GETTING ASSEMBLED.

24:35.267 --> 24:38.033
THIS IS KIND OF ROUGH,

24:35.267 --> 24:38.033
BRINGING

24:35.267 --> 24:38.033
IT IN AND SET UP INSIDE

24:35.267 --> 24:38.033
STORE--

24:38.033 --> 24:39.867
BOXES OUT.

24:38.033 --> 24:39.867
YEAH, LET'S MAKE SURE WE DON'T

24:39.867 --> 24:43.000
GET IN THIS SPOT AGAIN.

24:39.867 --> 24:43.000
OKAY.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.667
HI. HOW ARE YOU?

24:43.000 --> 24:45.667
HI.

24:45.667 --> 24:48.367
WHAT YOU BUYING?

24:45.667 --> 24:48.367
I NEED TO GET SOME TOILET

24:48.367 --> 24:49.067
STUFF.

24:48.367 --> 24:49.067
HI.

24:49.067 --> 24:52.133
HI.

24:49.067 --> 24:52.133
CLEAN THAT WITH?

24:52.133 --> 24:56.300
HI, MA'AM.

24:52.133 --> 24:56.300
AND THEN WHAT ARE YOU GONNA

24:56.300 --> 24:59.800
[laughs]

24:56.300 --> 24:59.800
THIS BOTTLE RIGHT THERE.

24:59.800 --> 25:01.600
THIS ONE.

24:59.800 --> 25:01.600
THE ALL-PURPOSE CLEANER.

25:01.600 --> 25:03.767
DO YOU HAVE A PET?

25:01.600 --> 25:03.767
DO YOU HAVE A DOG?

25:03.767 --> 25:05.967
NO?

25:03.767 --> 25:05.967
OKAY.

25:05.967 --> 25:10.200
HEY, JEN, DO WE HAVE--OH!

25:05.967 --> 25:10.200
SO THIS LOOKS LIKE A LOT OF

25:10.200 --> 25:11.100
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING TO CLEAN

25:10.200 --> 25:11.100
CHEMICALS.

25:11.100 --> 25:14.133
WITH?

25:11.100 --> 25:14.133
DO YOU MIND IF I ASK?

25:14.133 --> 25:15.933
EVERYTHING?

25:14.133 --> 25:15.933
SO WHY DON'T YOU TRY THIS

25:14.133 --> 25:15.933
TODAY

25:15.933 --> 25:18.600
TOO?

25:15.933 --> 25:18.600
YOU KNOW, THIS--YOU'RE

25:15.933 --> 25:18.600
SPRAYING,

25:18.600 --> 25:21.833
YOU KNOW--YEAH.

25:18.600 --> 25:21.833
JEN IS BEING WAY TOO

25:21.833 --> 25:24.933
AGGRESSIVE WITH THE CUSTOMERS.

25:21.833 --> 25:24.933
INSTEAD OF SELLING THE VALUE

25:21.833 --> 25:24.933
OF

25:24.933 --> 25:28.767
HER PRODUCT, SHE'S TEARING

25:24.933 --> 25:28.767
DOWN

25:24.933 --> 25:28.767
THE OTHER PRODUCTS, AND ROBIN

25:24.933 --> 25:28.767
IS

25:28.767 --> 25:33.233
EVEN STRUGGLING TO HAVE A

25:28.767 --> 25:33.233
CONVERSATION WITH ANYBODY.

25:33.233 --> 25:36.200
SEEING THE ECO-ME TEAM IN

25:33.233 --> 25:36.200
ACTION

25:33.233 --> 25:36.200
WAS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT

25:36.200 --> 25:38.433
I BROUGHT THEM TO CAMPING

25:36.200 --> 25:38.433
WORLD.

25:36.200 --> 25:38.433
THE OTHER IS FOR THEM TO

25:38.433 --> 25:40.733
INTERACT WITH A FOCUS GROUP OF

25:38.433 --> 25:40.733
CUSTOMERS.

25:40.733 --> 25:42.633
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY,

25:40.733 --> 25:42.633
THANK YOU FOR COMING TODAY FOR

25:42.633 --> 25:45.467
OUR FOCUS GROUP.

25:42.633 --> 25:45.467
SO THE NAME "ECO-ME"--WHEN YOU

25:45.467 --> 25:47.933
THINK OF THAT, WHAT COMES TO

25:45.467 --> 25:47.933
MIND?

25:47.933 --> 25:50.867
WHEN YOU SAY "ECO-ME," WHAT

25:47.933 --> 25:50.867
THERE'S NO TIE-IN TO WHAT THE

25:50.867 --> 25:53.967
IS THAT?

25:50.867 --> 25:53.967
ACTUAL PRODUCT IS.

25:53.967 --> 25:58.533
IT'S A LITTLE CONFUSING.

25:53.967 --> 25:58.533
IF IT WAS IN A SUPER MARKET

25:58.533 --> 26:00.600
ON THE END AISLE, I'D WALK

25:58.533 --> 26:00.600
RIGHT

25:58.533 --> 26:00.600
PAST IT.

26:00.600 --> 26:03.400
IS IT BECAUSE THE WORD

26:00.600 --> 26:03.400
"ECO"?

26:00.600 --> 26:03.400
JUST BY THE NAME "ECO-ME,"

26:03.400 --> 26:05.967
AND THEN--I WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT

26:03.400 --> 26:05.967
IT WAS.

26:05.967 --> 26:07.767
WHAT DO THE NAMES MEAN ON

26:05.967 --> 26:07.767
THESE?

26:07.767 --> 26:10.467
OH, YEAH.

26:07.767 --> 26:10.467
"BY MIA"?

26:10.467 --> 26:11.600
SO WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?

26:10.467 --> 26:11.600
THIS ONE SAYS "BY MIA."

26:11.600 --> 26:18.433
IT MEANS NOTHING TO ME.

26:11.600 --> 26:18.433
I DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE.

26:18.433 --> 26:21.200
IT WAS MADE VERY CLEAR

26:18.433 --> 26:21.200
DURING

26:18.433 --> 26:21.200
THIS FOCUS GROUP THAT THE

26:21.200 --> 26:24.433
CUSTOMERS ARE EXTREMELY

26:21.200 --> 26:24.433
CONFUSED

26:21.200 --> 26:24.433
ABOUT THIS PACKAGE.

26:24.433 --> 26:27.800
WE CAN'T SELL A PRODUCT THAT

26:24.433 --> 26:27.800
PEOPLE ARE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY.

26:27.800 --> 26:30.700
WHAT I'M HOPING IS THAT ROBIN

26:27.800 --> 26:30.700
AND JEN GOT THAT MESSAGE.

26:30.700 --> 26:32.533
WELL...

26:30.700 --> 26:32.533
MM-HMM.

26:32.533 --> 26:35.000
THAT WAS KIND OF A BIG DEAL

26:32.533 --> 26:35.000
FOR ME.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.967
YEAH.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.967
THE CONSUMER IS SAYING, "IT

26:36.967 --> 26:38.600
DOESN'T WORK," SO WE ARE GOING

26:38.600 --> 26:39.400
TO CHANGE THE NAME.

26:39.400 --> 26:41.100
IT'S JUST OVERWHELMING.

26:41.100 --> 26:44.100
IT'S OVERWHELMING.

26:50.267 --> 26:54.200
YOU SEEM BEAT UP RIGHT NOW.

26:50.267 --> 26:54.200
I FEEL THE OVERWHELMING

26:54.200 --> 26:59.500
BURDEN OF--DID I MAKE THE

26:54.200 --> 26:59.500
WRONG

26:54.200 --> 26:59.500
CHOICES FOR THE BRAND?

26:59.500 --> 27:03.467
THE REASON THAT I CONTINUE

26:59.500 --> 27:03.467
TO

26:59.500 --> 27:03.467
MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS IS

27:03.467 --> 27:08.467
BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN YOU, BUT

27:03.467 --> 27:08.467
I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND, IN A

27:08.467 --> 27:12.433
POSITIVE WAY, AND I'M

27:08.467 --> 27:12.433
STRUGGLING, THE DYNAMIC OF

27:08.467 --> 27:12.433
JEN.

27:12.433 --> 27:16.700
I WATCH HER INTERACT WITH

27:12.433 --> 27:16.700
PEOPLE, AND INSTEAD OF

27:12.433 --> 27:16.700
SELLING,

27:16.700 --> 27:19.267
SHE'S DEFENSIVE.

27:16.700 --> 27:19.267
I'M NOT WILLING TO SIT HERE

27:19.267 --> 27:20.733
AND HAVE A CONVERSATION...

27:19.267 --> 27:20.733
YEAH.

27:20.733 --> 27:22.800
THAT PICKS APART OUR V.P.

27:20.733 --> 27:22.800
OF

27:20.733 --> 27:22.800
SALES AND MARKETING AND MY

27:22.800 --> 27:25.200
PARTNER.

27:22.800 --> 27:25.200
IT'S REALLY NOT OKAY BY ME.

27:25.200 --> 27:29.067
I THINK YOU HAVE A

27:25.200 --> 27:29.067
DIFFICULT

27:25.200 --> 27:29.067
TIME SEPARATING YOUR

27:25.200 --> 27:29.067
FRIENDSHIP

27:29.067 --> 27:33.100
FROM HER ROLE.

27:29.067 --> 27:33.100
YOU WOULD BE BETTER OFF JUST

27:33.100 --> 27:34.900
SAYING, "YOU KNOW, I NEVER

27:33.100 --> 27:34.900
THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT WAY."

27:34.900 --> 27:37.833
MM-HMM.

27:34.900 --> 27:37.833
"I'LL TALK TO MY PEOPLE,"

27:34.900 --> 27:37.833
AND

27:37.833 --> 27:40.500
SAY, "THANK YOU FOR THE

27:37.833 --> 27:40.500
FEEDBACK."

27:40.500 --> 27:44.000
I DON'T AGREE.

27:40.500 --> 27:44.000
ROBIN SEEMS RESISTANT TO

27:44.000 --> 27:46.667
CHANGE WITH THE TWO BIGGEST

27:44.000 --> 27:46.667
ISSUES THAT I THINK ARE

27:44.000 --> 27:46.667
HOLDING

27:46.667 --> 27:49.667
THEM BACK--

27:46.667 --> 27:49.667
PACKAGING AND THE SALES

27:46.667 --> 27:49.667
PROCESS.

27:49.667 --> 27:52.700
IF SHE WON'T COME AROUND,

27:49.667 --> 27:52.700
I CANNOT DO A DEAL AND RISK A

27:52.700 --> 27:57.633
HALF A MILLION DOLLARS.

27:52.700 --> 27:57.633
DEREK.

27:57.633 --> 27:58.967
HI, DEREK.

27:57.633 --> 27:58.967
DEREK, SAY HELLO TO

27:58.967 --> 27:59.633
EVERYBODY.

27:58.967 --> 27:59.633
I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO

27:59.633 --> 28:00.967
HI, EVERYONE.

27:59.633 --> 28:00.967
HI, DEREK.

28:00.967 --> 28:02.467
HOW ARE YOU GUYS?

28:00.967 --> 28:02.467
DEREK'S GONNA UNVEIL A

28:00.967 --> 28:02.467
COUPLE

28:02.467 --> 28:04.133
OF CONCEPTS.

28:02.467 --> 28:04.133
TODAY I'VE BROUGHT IN A

28:02.467 --> 28:04.133
GRAPHIC

28:04.133 --> 28:07.167
DESIGNER THAT'S COME UP WITH A

28:04.133 --> 28:07.167
NEW LOOK AND MESSAGE FOR

28:04.133 --> 28:07.167
ECO-ME.

28:07.167 --> 28:09.267
I TALKED TO THE TWO OF YOU

28:07.167 --> 28:09.267
YESTERDAY ABOUT HAVING AN

28:09.267 --> 28:10.800
IDENTIFIER.

28:09.267 --> 28:10.800
MM-HMM.

28:10.800 --> 28:12.800
SO, WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOUR

28:10.800 --> 28:12.800
SNEAKERS OR YOU LOOK AT A

28:10.800 --> 28:12.800
BOTTLE

28:12.800 --> 28:15.367
OR YOU LOOK AT SOMETHING, IT'S

28:12.800 --> 28:15.367
A LOGO FOR SOMETHING.

28:15.367 --> 28:19.033
THIS IS WHAT,

28:15.367 --> 28:19.033
CONCEPTUALLY--WHEN

28:15.367 --> 28:19.033
YOU SEE THE TREE, YOU THINK OF

28:19.033 --> 28:20.433
ECO-ME.

28:19.033 --> 28:20.433
YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE'S

28:20.433 --> 28:23.100
ACTUALLY ELEMENTS IN HERE OF

28:20.433 --> 28:23.100
THE

28:20.433 --> 28:23.100
BITS AND PIECES OF ALL THE

28:20.433 --> 28:23.100
STUFF

28:23.100 --> 28:25.367
THAT IT WOULD CLEAN.

28:23.100 --> 28:25.367
THIS WOULD BE WHAT OUR

28:23.100 --> 28:25.367
BOTTLE

28:25.367 --> 28:26.700
WOULD LOOK LIKE.

28:25.367 --> 28:26.700
WRAPPED?

28:26.700 --> 28:28.033
FULLY WRAPPED.

28:26.700 --> 28:28.033
WRAPPED.

28:28.033 --> 28:30.300
AND WE GOT RID OF ALL THE

28:28.033 --> 28:30.300
NAMES YOU USED TO USE.

28:30.300 --> 28:35.333
I REALLY DON'T LIKE THE

28:30.300 --> 28:35.333
COLORS.

28:35.333 --> 28:36.900
IT'S HARD.

28:35.333 --> 28:36.900
IT'S LIKE SELLING SOMEBODY

28:36.900 --> 28:39.400
ELSE'S VISION.

28:36.900 --> 28:39.400
THE GREEN TO YELLOW--THEY

28:36.900 --> 28:39.400
FEEL A

28:39.400 --> 28:42.400
LITTLE BIT GENERIC.

28:39.400 --> 28:42.400
I DON'T GET IT BEING ECO-ME.

28:42.400 --> 28:45.167
WE DON'T WANT TO BE NEAR

28:42.400 --> 28:45.167
THAT

28:42.400 --> 28:45.167
MUTED, YOU KNOW, PALETTE.

28:45.167 --> 28:47.633
THIS TYPE OF PRODUCT COULD BE

28:45.167 --> 28:47.633
ON

28:45.167 --> 28:47.633
THE SHELF NEXT TO OTHER

28:45.167 --> 28:47.633
PRODUCTS

28:47.633 --> 28:49.067
THAT ARE NICE AND BRIGHT AND

28:47.633 --> 28:49.067
GREEN.

28:49.067 --> 28:51.967
USUALLY WHEN YOU SEE BRIGHT

28:49.067 --> 28:51.967
PRIMARY COLORS, WHAT COMES TO

28:51.967 --> 28:56.000
MIND ARE FAST-FOOD JOINTS OR

28:51.967 --> 28:56.000
P&G

28:51.967 --> 28:56.000
BRANDING.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.667
P&G--THE $9 BILLION

28:56.000 --> 28:58.667
COMPANY?

28:56.000 --> 28:58.667
YEAH.

28:58.667 --> 29:02.733
OH.

28:58.667 --> 29:02.733
WE DON'T WANT TO BE SO NICHE-Y

29:02.733 --> 29:05.267
THAT WE'RE JUST SPEAKING TO

29:02.733 --> 29:05.267
PEOPLE WHO ARE ONLY

29:05.267 --> 29:07.300
ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS.

29:05.267 --> 29:07.300
WE WANT TO BE FAR MORE

29:07.300 --> 29:09.467
MAINSTREAM.

29:07.300 --> 29:09.467
WHETHER YELLOW IS RIGHT OR

29:09.467 --> 29:11.533
GREEN IS RIGHT OR PURPLE--I'M

29:09.467 --> 29:11.533
KIND OF CONFUSED.

29:11.533 --> 29:14.000
YOU DIDN'T WANT A LOT OF

29:11.533 --> 29:14.000
BRIGHT

29:11.533 --> 29:14.000
COLORS, BUT YOU DIDN'T SEEM TO

29:14.000 --> 29:16.033
MIND TO THROW UP ALL OVER YOUR

29:14.000 --> 29:16.033
BOTTLE.

29:16.033 --> 29:18.433
OKAY, SO I DON'T TAKE IT AS

29:16.033 --> 29:18.433
THROW-UP, SO, YOU KNOW, I--

29:18.433 --> 29:20.867
BUT, I MEAN, YOU JUST,

29:18.433 --> 29:20.867
RIGHT

29:18.433 --> 29:20.867
OUT OF THE GATE, JUST SAID TOO

29:20.867 --> 29:22.233
MANY--

29:20.867 --> 29:22.233
I SAID PRIMARY COLORS, BUT

29:22.233 --> 29:23.833
I SAID I DON'T LIKE--

29:22.233 --> 29:23.833
OH, SO, IF IT'S NOT--'CAUSE

29:23.833 --> 29:25.267
THIS IS OKAY 'CAUSE IT'S

29:23.833 --> 29:25.267
PASTELS?

29:25.267 --> 29:26.967
I WOULDN'T EVEN SAY THOSE

29:25.267 --> 29:26.967
ARE

29:25.267 --> 29:26.967
PASTELS, BUT I FEEL LIKE THESE

29:26.967 --> 29:30.600
PRIMARY COLORS SCREAM

29:26.967 --> 29:30.600
"MASS MARKET"--TOO EXTREME.

29:30.600 --> 29:33.533
DOES THAT MEAN BECAUSE IT'S

29:30.600 --> 29:33.533
NOT YOUR IDEA?

29:33.533 --> 29:35.633
ROBIN, I DON'T GIVE A CRAP

29:33.533 --> 29:35.633
WHAT

29:33.533 --> 29:35.633
IT LOOKS LIKE.

29:35.633 --> 29:38.367
WHAT I CARE ABOUT IS THAT IT

29:35.633 --> 29:38.367
SELLS, AND THAT ISN'T SELLING.

29:38.367 --> 29:41.933
I WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT I'M

29:38.367 --> 29:41.933
IN

29:38.367 --> 29:41.933
CHARGE AND THAT, DURING THIS

29:41.933 --> 29:44.900
PROCESS, YOUR FEEDBACK ISN'T

29:41.933 --> 29:44.900
ANY MORE IMPORTANT THAN

29:41.933 --> 29:44.900
ANYBODY

29:44.900 --> 29:45.733
ELSE'S.

29:44.900 --> 29:45.733
FUNCTION TOGETHER, BUT WE ARE

29:45.733 --> 29:47.967
WE'RE A TEAM, AND WE'RE GONNA

29:47.967 --> 29:51.100
GONNA MAKE A CHANGE.

29:47.967 --> 29:51.100
COMING UP...

29:51.100 --> 29:52.833
IT'S KIND OF A VIOLATION OF

29:51.100 --> 29:52.833
OUR

29:51.100 --> 29:52.833
AGREEMENT.

29:52.833 --> 29:54.967
YOU TOLD ME TO WORK WITH

29:52.833 --> 29:54.967
THE

29:52.833 --> 29:54.967
DESIGNER.

29:54.967 --> 29:56.300
BUT YOU DIDN'T!

29:54.967 --> 29:56.300
YOU ENDED UP--

29:56.300 --> 29:57.633
YEAH, WE DID.

29:56.300 --> 29:57.633
WELL, I JUST GOT OFF THE

29:57.633 --> 29:59.067
PHONE WITH THEM, AND THEY HAVE

29:57.633 --> 29:59.067
NO IDEA WHY THE FINAL PRODUCT

29:59.067 --> 30:02.500
LOOKS THAT WAY.

29:59.067 --> 30:02.500
AND LATER...

30:02.500 --> 30:07.567
IF YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO FIRE

30:02.500 --> 30:07.567
JEN FROM THIS SALES POSITION,

30:07.567 --> 30:09.033
I'M NOT WILLING TO PUT MY

30:07.567 --> 30:09.033
MONEY

30:09.033 --> 30:09.700
IN.

30:09.700 --> 30:11.600
IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE.

30:13.000 --> 30:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

30:20.400 --> 30:22.667
I'VE COME TO NEW YORK, AND

30:20.400 --> 30:22.667
I'VE SET UP A MEETING WITH JEN

30:22.667 --> 30:24.500
AND THE MANAGERS OF

30:22.667 --> 30:24.500
THE STRAND HOTEL.

30:24.500 --> 30:27.867
LANDING A MAJOR HOTEL CHAIN

30:24.500 --> 30:27.867
COULD REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE

30:27.867 --> 30:29.733
IN THIS BUSINESS.

30:27.867 --> 30:29.733
IT COULD BE AS MUCH AS THREE

30:29.733 --> 30:31.900
TIMES MORE THAN A TYPICAL

30:29.733 --> 30:31.900
RETAIL

30:29.733 --> 30:31.900
ACCOUNT.

30:31.900 --> 30:33.233
HI. HOW ARE YOU?

30:31.900 --> 30:33.233
I'M JEN.

30:33.233 --> 30:34.567
NICE TO MEET YOU.

30:33.233 --> 30:34.567
JOHN. PLEASURE.

30:34.567 --> 30:36.567
SO THANK YOU FOR MEETING

30:34.567 --> 30:36.567
WITH

30:34.567 --> 30:36.567
US.

30:36.567 --> 30:38.800
WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

30:36.567 --> 30:38.800
YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.

30:38.800 --> 30:40.733
WE'RE KNOWN FOR OUR

30:38.800 --> 30:40.733
CLEANLINESS,

30:38.800 --> 30:40.733
SO THIS IS IMPORTANT TO US.

30:40.733 --> 30:42.733
I CAN READ THAT.

30:40.733 --> 30:42.733
THIS IS A BIG MEETING FOR

30:42.733 --> 30:45.967
ECO-ME, AND I'M HOPEFUL JEN

30:42.733 --> 30:45.967
CAN

30:42.733 --> 30:45.967
RISE TO THE OCCASION.

30:45.967 --> 30:49.633
SO WE HAVE AN AMAZING LINE

30:45.967 --> 30:49.633
OF PRODUCTS THAT REALLY GET

30:45.967 --> 30:49.633
THE

30:49.633 --> 30:52.367
JOB DONE WITH THE MOST NATURAL

30:49.633 --> 30:52.367
INGREDIENTS POSSIBLE.

30:52.367 --> 30:54.833
WHICH OF YOUR PRODUCTS YOU

30:52.367 --> 30:54.833
WOULD USE AS A DISINFECTANT?

30:54.833 --> 30:57.400
WHICH OUR BIGGEST CONCERN.

30:54.833 --> 30:57.400
OUR ALL-PURPOSE CLEANER IS

30:54.833 --> 30:57.400
A

30:57.400 --> 30:59.733
DISINFECTANT.

30:57.400 --> 30:59.733
IT'S MADE WITH VINEGAR, WHICH

30:59.733 --> 31:02.967
KILLS UP TO 96% BACTERIA AND

30:59.733 --> 31:02.967
GERMS ALONE.

31:02.967 --> 31:05.633
ARE YOU GETTING THAT, IN

31:02.967 --> 31:05.633
TERMS OF AN AROMA?

31:05.633 --> 31:07.433
NO.

31:05.633 --> 31:07.433
AT ALL?

31:07.433 --> 31:10.700
YOU KNOW, A TINY BIT, BUT

31:07.433 --> 31:10.700
AMMONIUM BLEACH, THAT'S OKAY?

31:10.700 --> 31:13.067
[laughs]

31:10.700 --> 31:13.067
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST FUNNY TO

31:10.700 --> 31:13.067
ME.

31:13.067 --> 31:14.400
OKAY, INTERESTING.

31:13.067 --> 31:14.400
YEAH.

31:14.400 --> 31:16.767
SPEAK TO ME MORE A LITTLE

31:14.400 --> 31:16.767
ABOUT YOUR DILUTION SYSTEM.

31:16.767 --> 31:18.100
OKAY, EVERY--

31:16.767 --> 31:18.100
HOW DOES THAT WORK?

31:18.100 --> 31:20.033
YES.

31:18.100 --> 31:20.033
EVERYTHING ON--IT DEPENDS--

31:20.033 --> 31:23.533
YEP, WHAT IT IS THAT

31:20.033 --> 31:23.533
YOU'RE GONNA ORDER, AS FAR AS

31:23.533 --> 31:30.633
SIZE-WISE, OUR DILUTION,

31:23.533 --> 31:30.633
UM--SORRY.

31:30.633 --> 31:32.833
I'M WORRIED ABOUT JEN'S

31:30.633 --> 31:32.833
PRESENTATION SO FAR.

31:32.833 --> 31:36.100
SHE'S COMING ACROSS UNPREPARED

31:32.833 --> 31:36.100
AND UNENTHUSIASTIC.

31:36.100 --> 31:38.233
LOOK, IT'S ONE THING TO KNOW

31:36.100 --> 31:38.233
YOUR PRODUCT, BUT WHEN YOU'RE

31:38.233 --> 31:41.167
GONNA SELL TO A NATIONAL HOTEL

31:38.233 --> 31:41.167
CHAIN, YOU BETTER BRING YOUR

31:41.167 --> 31:42.767
"A" GAME.

31:41.167 --> 31:42.767
I MEAN, IT SOUNDS LIKE A

31:42.767 --> 31:44.333
GREAT PRODUCT.

31:42.767 --> 31:44.333
SO WE HAVE ONE OR TWO OTHER

31:44.333 --> 31:46.200
VENDORS THAT WE'RE

31:44.333 --> 31:46.200
ENTERTAINING,

31:44.333 --> 31:46.200
AND...

31:46.200 --> 31:47.533
GREAT.

31:46.200 --> 31:47.533
THANK YOU.

31:47.533 --> 31:48.867
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

31:47.533 --> 31:48.867
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

31:48.867 --> 31:50.233
HOLD ON A SECOND.

31:48.867 --> 31:50.233
I HAVE A QUESTION.

31:50.233 --> 31:51.700
WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO TO EARN

31:50.233 --> 31:51.700
YOUR BUSINESS TODAY?

31:51.700 --> 31:54.700
I MEAN, THAT'S OBVIOUSLY WHY

31:51.700 --> 31:54.700
WE'RE HERE.

31:54.700 --> 31:57.867
WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE

31:54.700 --> 31:57.867
OTHER PRODUCTS, BUT WHEN JEN

31:54.700 --> 31:57.867
AND

31:57.867 --> 32:03.567
I TALKED ABOUT COMING HERE, WE

31:57.867 --> 32:03.567
CAME TO ASK FOR THE SALE,

31:57.867 --> 32:03.567
SO...

32:03.567 --> 32:07.300
WELL, I THINK, YOU KNOW, IN

32:03.567 --> 32:07.300
SHORT, YOU KNOW, THE ONLY

32:07.300 --> 32:10.800
QUESTION THAT REALLY WILL MAKE

32:07.300 --> 32:10.800
SENSE IS TESTING THIS PRODUCT

32:10.800 --> 32:12.133
OUT.

32:10.800 --> 32:12.133
ABSOLUTELY.

32:12.133 --> 32:13.633
DO YOU HAVE A ROOM THAT WE

32:12.133 --> 32:13.633
CAN GO CLEAN RIGHT NOW?

32:13.633 --> 32:15.300
YES, OF COURSE.

32:13.633 --> 32:15.300
WE SHOULD DO THAT.

32:15.300 --> 32:17.533
WELL, WE'RE WILLING TO GO

32:15.300 --> 32:17.533
CLEAN TOILETS FOR YOU RIGHT

32:15.300 --> 32:17.533
NOW,

32:17.533 --> 32:19.300
SO LET'S--

32:17.533 --> 32:19.300
LET'S GIVE IT A SHOT.

32:19.300 --> 32:20.667
DO YOU HAVE A ROOM THAT WE

32:19.300 --> 32:20.667
CAN GO TEST THIS IN?

32:20.667 --> 32:22.000
ABSOLUTELY.

32:20.667 --> 32:22.000
OKAY, GREAT.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.233
LOOK, I DIDN'T COME HERE TO

32:22.000 --> 32:24.233
MAKE

32:22.000 --> 32:24.233
THIS MY SALES PRESENTATION,

32:22.000 --> 32:24.233
BUT

32:24.233 --> 32:26.533
IF JEN WON'T ASK FOR THE SALE,

32:24.233 --> 32:26.533
I WILL.

32:26.533 --> 32:28.900
I'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO

32:26.533 --> 32:28.900
MAKE SURE WE LAND THIS ORDER,

32:28.900 --> 32:32.400
INCLUDING GET MY HANDS DIRTY.

32:28.900 --> 32:32.400
[knock at door]

32:32.400 --> 32:35.800
HOUSEKEEPING.

32:32.400 --> 32:35.800
ALL RIGHT!

32:35.800 --> 32:38.167
I'LL TAKE THE SHOWER.

32:35.800 --> 32:38.167
JEN, YOU TAKE THE TOILET.

32:38.167 --> 32:39.700
I DON'T DO THE TOILET IN MY

32:38.167 --> 32:39.700
OWN HOUSE.

32:39.700 --> 32:41.967
REALLY?

32:39.700 --> 32:41.967
SO YOU'RE REALLY GOING IN

32:41.967 --> 32:43.833
THERE, HUH?

32:41.967 --> 32:43.833
HECK, YEAH, BECAUSE IF

32:43.833 --> 32:46.167
I DON'T BELIEVE IN THE

32:43.833 --> 32:46.167
PRODUCT,

32:43.833 --> 32:46.167
YOU WON'T BELIEVE IN THE

32:46.167 --> 32:48.200
PRODUCT.

32:46.167 --> 32:48.200
LOVE IT.

32:48.200 --> 32:50.367
COME ON, JEN!

32:48.200 --> 32:50.367
YOU'RE LIKE THE SUPERVISOR OR

32:50.367 --> 32:52.167
SOMETHING.

32:50.367 --> 32:52.167
DOES IT LEAVE ANY STREAKS,

32:50.367 --> 32:52.167
OR

32:52.167 --> 32:53.833
IS IT...?

32:52.167 --> 32:53.833
I'D LIKE TO HAVE A CHANCE

32:52.167 --> 32:53.833
TO

32:53.833 --> 32:55.267
FINISH MY JOB FIRST.

32:53.833 --> 32:55.267
OKAY.

32:55.267 --> 32:56.600
[laughs]

32:55.267 --> 32:56.600
OKAY, FAIR ENOUGH.

32:56.600 --> 32:57.967
OKAY?

32:56.600 --> 32:57.967
THIS GIVES YOU A CHANCE TO BE

32:57.967 --> 33:00.433
ENTHUSIASTIC AND EXCITED ABOUT

32:57.967 --> 33:00.433
YOUR PRODUCT.

33:00.433 --> 33:03.867
ANYTIME THE CUSTOMER CAN SEE

33:00.433 --> 33:03.867
THAT, THEIR CONFIDENCE BUILDS.

33:03.867 --> 33:05.967
WHAT I WANT YOU TO SEE IS THE

33:03.867 --> 33:05.967
CLEANLINESS OF THE GLASS, BUT

33:05.967 --> 33:07.733
MORE IMPORTANTLY, TAKE A

33:05.967 --> 33:07.733
SNIFF.

33:05.967 --> 33:07.733
I GET THE SCENT.

33:07.733 --> 33:09.067
SMELLS CLEAN.

33:07.733 --> 33:09.067
LIGHT.

33:09.067 --> 33:10.400
I GET THE SCENT.

33:09.067 --> 33:10.400
NO RESIDUE.

33:10.400 --> 33:11.867
THERE IS A FRESHNESS THAT'S

33:10.400 --> 33:11.867
IMPRESSIVE.

33:11.867 --> 33:13.367
YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE YOU

33:11.867 --> 33:13.367
WANT

33:11.867 --> 33:13.367
TO GET IN THERE.

33:13.367 --> 33:14.733
COME ON.

33:13.367 --> 33:14.733
I'M SO--I--

33:14.733 --> 33:16.133
LET ME SHOW YOU HOW TO

33:14.733 --> 33:16.133
CLEAN

33:14.733 --> 33:16.133
THE TOILET.

33:16.133 --> 33:18.133
ALL RIGHT.

33:16.133 --> 33:18.133
YOU GOT TO GET DOWN BECAUSE

33:18.133 --> 33:19.567
MOST OF THE RESIDUE--

33:18.133 --> 33:19.567
THAT'S WHERE ALL THE GROSS

33:19.567 --> 33:21.033
IS.

33:19.567 --> 33:21.033
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO TWIST

33:21.033 --> 33:24.100
JEN'S ARM TO SHOW THEM HOW

33:21.033 --> 33:24.100
GOOD

33:21.033 --> 33:24.100
ECO-ME PRODUCTS REALLY ARE.

33:24.100 --> 33:26.800
SHE SHOULD BE ACTIVELY

33:24.100 --> 33:26.800
PARTICIPATING IN SELLING.

33:26.800 --> 33:28.767
NICE.

33:26.800 --> 33:28.767
IF THEY SEE IT, THEY'LL

33:28.767 --> 33:30.667
BELIEVE IT.

33:28.767 --> 33:30.667
WELL, WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO

33:30.667 --> 33:32.133
YOUR FIRST ORDER.

33:30.667 --> 33:32.133
WE'RE EXCITED.

33:32.133 --> 33:33.800
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

33:32.133 --> 33:33.800
WE'LL HAVE THE BOX ON THE

33:33.800 --> 33:36.533
WAY.

33:33.800 --> 33:36.533
DESPITE JEN'S INABILITY TO

33:33.800 --> 33:36.533
SELL

33:36.533 --> 33:39.867
THE ECO-ME PRODUCT TO THE

33:36.533 --> 33:39.867
HOTEL,

33:36.533 --> 33:39.867
THE STRAND'S FEEDBACK WAS VERY

33:39.867 --> 33:42.133
POSITIVE, AND THINGS ARE

33:39.867 --> 33:42.133
LOOKING

33:39.867 --> 33:42.133
GOOD IN TERMS OF GETTING AN

33:42.133 --> 33:45.667
AN ORDER.

33:42.133 --> 33:45.667
YOU UNDERSTAND THE PRODUCT,

33:42.133 --> 33:45.667
AND

33:45.667 --> 33:50.267
YOU ARE A GREAT FACE OF THE

33:45.667 --> 33:50.267
COMPANY, BUT I STILL DON'T

33:45.667 --> 33:50.267
THINK

33:50.267 --> 33:52.233
THAT SALES IS YOUR CORE

33:50.267 --> 33:52.233
COMPETENCY.

33:52.233 --> 33:54.100
OKAY.

33:52.233 --> 33:54.100
I DISAGREE.

33:54.100 --> 33:57.300
I AM THE REASON WE HAVE SALES

33:54.100 --> 33:57.300
FOR THIS COMPANY.

33:57.300 --> 33:59.067
THERE'S NO ROOM FOR DISCUSSION

33:57.300 --> 33:59.067
HERE.

33:59.067 --> 34:00.667
YEAH, BUT THEN I'M NOT

33:59.067 --> 34:00.667
WRITING A "HALF A MILLION

34:00.667 --> 34:02.167
DOLLAR" CHECK.

34:00.667 --> 34:02.167
THE COMPANY'S ABOUT TO FIZZLE

34:02.167 --> 34:05.300
AWAY, AND I THINK WHERE I'M AT

34:02.167 --> 34:05.300
IS, I'M NOT WILLING TO DO THE

34:05.300 --> 34:09.167
DEAL IF YOU'RE IN CHARGE OF

34:05.300 --> 34:09.167
SALES.

34:09.167 --> 34:12.800
I'VE BEEN WORKING MY ASS

34:09.167 --> 34:12.800
OFF

34:09.167 --> 34:12.800
FOR SIX YEARS...

34:12.800 --> 34:14.833
NOBODY'S DOUBTING THAT.

34:12.800 --> 34:14.833
TO GET US ON THE MAP...

34:14.833 --> 34:16.400
MM-HMM.

34:14.833 --> 34:16.400
AND SOMEONE IS COMING IN

34:14.833 --> 34:16.400
AND

34:16.400 --> 34:19.667
SAYING, "PFFT, YOU SUCK."

34:16.400 --> 34:19.667
IF YOU WANT TO SAVE YOUR

34:19.667 --> 34:22.467
BUSINESS, YOUR REACTION TO

34:19.667 --> 34:22.467
CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM

34:19.667 --> 34:22.467
SHOULDN'T

34:22.467 --> 34:24.333
BE DEFENSIVE.

34:24.333 --> 34:25.733
YOU DON'T LIKE CONSTRUCTIVE

34:25.733 --> 34:26.667
CRITICISM.

34:26.667 --> 34:30.467
YOU JUST DON'T LIKE IT.

34:36.900 --> 34:38.400
WHY DOES THAT UPSET YOU?

34:36.900 --> 34:38.400
THERE'S NO ROOM FOR

34:38.400 --> 34:43.632
DISCUSSION HERE.

34:38.400 --> 34:43.632
[line trilling]

34:43.632 --> 34:48.100
I'M GONE.

34:43.632 --> 34:48.100
HEY, ROBIN.

34:48.100 --> 34:50.733
MARCUS.

34:48.100 --> 34:50.733
YOU GOT A MINUTE?

34:50.733 --> 34:54.167
SO I JUST SPENT AN HOUR WITH

34:50.733 --> 34:54.167
JEN AT THE STRAND HOTEL IN AN

34:54.167 --> 34:56.933
APPOINTMENT THAT I GOT SET UP.

34:54.167 --> 34:56.933
WE WENT UPSTAIRS TO ONE OF THE

34:56.933 --> 34:59.633
ROOMS.

34:56.933 --> 34:59.633
WE CLEANED IT, AND THEN I GAVE

34:59.633 --> 35:02.867
CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM.

34:59.633 --> 35:02.867
SHE BECAME UNGLUED.

35:02.867 --> 35:05.900
AND I SAID, "JEN, YOU CAN'T BE

35:02.867 --> 35:05.900
DEFENSIVE EVERY TIME SOMEBODY

35:05.900 --> 35:09.267
GIVES FEEDBACK.

35:05.900 --> 35:09.267
IT MAY BE TRUE THAT THE SALES

35:09.267 --> 35:12.633
THING IS NOT FOR YOU," AND AS

35:09.267 --> 35:12.633
YOU WOULD HAVE IMAGINED, SHE

35:09.267 --> 35:12.633
WAS

35:12.633 --> 35:14.567
NOT HAPPY ABOUT THAT.

35:14.567 --> 35:16.933
HOW DO WE BEST MOVE FORWARD SO

35:16.933 --> 35:19.700
THAT IT WORKS FOR EVERYBODY?

35:30.700 --> 35:35.600
YEAH.

35:30.700 --> 35:35.600
I ENCOURAGE YOU TO TALK TO JEN

35:35.600 --> 35:37.233
ABOUT OUR CONVERSATION, AND,

35:35.600 --> 35:37.233
YOU

35:37.233 --> 35:38.167
KNOW, I THINK IT'S ENOUGH

35:37.233 --> 35:38.167
ABOUT

35:38.167 --> 35:42.033
THAT, OKAY?

35:51.567 --> 35:53.800
WHY ARE YOU SO UPSET?

35:51.567 --> 35:53.800
BECAUSE THIS IS MY

35:53.800 --> 35:56.000
LIVELIHOOD, MARCUS.

35:53.800 --> 35:56.000
BUT I'M NOT TRYING TO TAKE

35:56.000 --> 35:57.333
YOUR LIVELIHOOD AWAY.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.333
YES.

35:57.333 --> 35:58.833
I'M TRYING TO SAVE IT.

35:57.333 --> 35:58.833
YOU SEEM LIKE YOU ARE.

35:58.833 --> 36:01.733
WITHOUT ME IN MIND, YOU SEEM

35:58.833 --> 36:01.733
LIKE YOU HAVE AN AGENDA, AND

36:01.733 --> 36:03.567
THAT'S WHY...

36:01.733 --> 36:03.567
HERE'S WHAT MY AGENDA IS.

36:03.567 --> 36:05.400
MY AGENDA IS TO SAVE YOUR

36:03.567 --> 36:05.400
BUSINESS.

36:05.400 --> 36:07.067
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

36:05.400 --> 36:07.067
YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN A

36:05.400 --> 36:07.067
PAYCHECK

36:07.067 --> 36:09.933
IN HOW LONG--TWO YEARS?

36:07.067 --> 36:09.933
THREE YEARS?

36:09.933 --> 36:12.100
OKAY.

36:09.933 --> 36:12.100
OKAY, YOU GOT TO LET ME

36:09.933 --> 36:12.100
HELP.

36:12.100 --> 36:13.767
I WANT YOU TO HELP.

36:12.100 --> 36:13.767
OKAY, I'M GONNA DO IT.

36:13.767 --> 36:16.833
BUT I WANT YOU TO

36:13.767 --> 36:16.833
UNDERSTAND

36:13.767 --> 36:16.833
THAT I DO DESERVE TO BE IN THE

36:16.833 --> 36:18.633
SALES BUSINESS.

36:16.833 --> 36:18.633
THIS IS ME.

36:18.633 --> 36:20.100
THIS IS WHAT I DO.

36:18.633 --> 36:20.100
SO ARE YOU--

36:20.100 --> 36:21.500
THIS IS WHAT I'VE ALWAYS

36:20.100 --> 36:21.500
DONE.

36:21.500 --> 36:22.933
ARE YOU WILLING TO BE

36:21.500 --> 36:22.933
COACHED

36:21.500 --> 36:22.933
THROUGH THAT PROCESS?

36:22.933 --> 36:24.267
YES!

36:22.933 --> 36:24.267
OKAY.

36:24.267 --> 36:27.400
I WILL GIVE YOU THE SUPPORT

36:24.267 --> 36:27.400
THAT

36:24.267 --> 36:27.400
YOU NEED, BUT YOU HAVE TO NOT

36:27.400 --> 36:29.067
GET EXPLOSIVE WITH ME.

36:27.400 --> 36:29.067
I--

36:29.067 --> 36:30.667
AND YOU HAVE TO TRUST THAT

36:29.067 --> 36:30.667
WHAT I'M TELLING YOU ISN'T TO

36:30.667 --> 36:33.533
HURT YOU--IT'S TO HELP YOU.

36:30.667 --> 36:33.533
YOU REALLY HAVE TO BELIEVE

36:30.667 --> 36:33.533
THAT.

36:33.533 --> 36:35.267
IS THAT A DEAL?

36:33.533 --> 36:35.267
YES, ABSOLUTELY.

36:35.267 --> 36:36.933
OKAY, CAN WE SHAKE ON THAT?

36:36.933 --> 36:38.100
COME ON.

36:38.100 --> 36:40.767
[sniffles]

36:43.233 --> 36:45.967
I'M BACK IN LOS ANGELES,

36:43.233 --> 36:45.967
AND

36:43.233 --> 36:45.967
I WAS ORIGINALLY ON MY WAY TO

36:45.967 --> 36:48.600
ECO-ME TO TALK TO ROBIN ABOUT

36:45.967 --> 36:48.600
JEN'S PERFORMANCE AT

36:48.600 --> 36:51.767
THE STRAND HOTEL IN NEW

36:48.600 --> 36:51.767
YORK...

36:48.600 --> 36:51.767
UNTIL I GOT A CALL FROM THE

36:51.767 --> 36:54.967
GRAPHIC DESIGNER TELLING ME

36:51.767 --> 36:54.967
THAT

36:51.767 --> 36:54.967
ROBIN CHANGED THE LABELS.

36:54.967 --> 37:00.100
THAT WAS WAY MORE PRESSING.

36:54.967 --> 37:00.100
ROBIN?

37:00.100 --> 37:02.667
SO I JUST GOT THROUGH FINDING

37:00.100 --> 37:02.667
OUT THAT YOU CHANGED THE

37:00.100 --> 37:02.667
LABELS.

37:02.667 --> 37:04.433
WE JUST DIDN'T LIKE THE

37:02.667 --> 37:04.433
DIRECTION IT WAS GOING.

37:04.433 --> 37:07.500
OUR DEAL WAS, WHEN I LEFT

37:04.433 --> 37:07.500
HERE, I TOLD YOU THAT I WAS IN

37:07.500 --> 37:08.833
CHARGE.

37:07.500 --> 37:08.833
MM-HMM.

37:08.833 --> 37:12.200
AND WHAT I HAVE TO START TO

37:08.833 --> 37:12.200
WONDER IS, DO YOU TAKE

37:08.833 --> 37:12.200
DIRECTION

37:12.200 --> 37:13.533
WELL?

37:12.200 --> 37:13.533
CAN I TRUST YOU?

37:13.533 --> 37:15.133
IT'S KIND OF A VIOLATION OF

37:13.533 --> 37:15.133
OUR

37:13.533 --> 37:15.133
AGREEMENT.

37:15.133 --> 37:17.233
YOU TOLD ME TO WORK WITH

37:15.133 --> 37:17.233
THE

37:15.133 --> 37:17.233
DESIGNER.

37:17.233 --> 37:18.567
BUT YOU DIDN'T!

37:17.233 --> 37:18.567
YOU ENDED UP--

37:18.567 --> 37:19.900
YEAH, WE DID.

37:18.567 --> 37:19.900
WELL, I JUST GOT OFF THE

37:19.900 --> 37:20.600
PHONE WITH THEM, AND THEY HAVE

37:19.900 --> 37:20.600
SO YOU JUST WENT ON YOUR

37:19.900 --> 37:20.600
OWN

37:20.600 --> 37:21.967
NO IDEA WHY THE FINAL PRODUCT

37:20.600 --> 37:21.967
LOOKS THAT WAY.

37:21.967 --> 37:23.667
BECAUSE WE WERE TRYING TO

37:21.967 --> 37:23.667
GET

37:21.967 --> 37:23.667
IT THAT WAY, AND THEY

37:21.967 --> 37:23.667
COULDN'T.

37:23.667 --> 37:27.333
SO, AT A CERTAIN POINT, WE PUT

37:23.667 --> 37:27.333
IT INTO THE CONTEXT OF WHAT

37:23.667 --> 37:27.333
IT--

37:27.333 --> 37:30.000
AND DID THAT?

37:27.333 --> 37:30.000
ARE THERE OTHER TIMES THIS IS

37:30.000 --> 37:31.333
GONNA HAPPEN?

37:30.000 --> 37:31.333
I MEAN, DO I HAVE TO BE

37:31.333 --> 37:33.067
WONDERING ALL THE TIME THAT

37:31.333 --> 37:33.067
WHEN

37:31.333 --> 37:33.067
WE AGREE ON SOMETHING, YOU'RE

37:33.067 --> 37:35.067
GONNA DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT?

37:33.067 --> 37:35.067
NO, BUT YOU HAVE TO

37:35.067 --> 37:37.967
UNDERSTAND THAT IF YOU'RE

37:35.067 --> 37:37.967
TRYING

37:35.067 --> 37:37.967
TO CHANGE THE ENTIRE LOOK OF

37:35.067 --> 37:37.967
MY

37:37.967 --> 37:41.100
COMPANY AND OF OUR BRAND--

37:37.967 --> 37:41.100
 COMPANY.

37:41.100 --> 37:43.700
 COMPANY, THAT

37:41.100 --> 37:43.700
SOMETIMES SOMEBODY MIGHT NEED

37:41.100 --> 37:43.700
TO

37:43.700 --> 37:45.300
GO OFF AND DO THEIR OWN THING,

37:43.700 --> 37:45.300
WHETHER--

37:45.300 --> 37:47.100
THAT'S NOT OKAY.

37:45.300 --> 37:47.100
WHEN WE STATE WHAT THE RULES

37:45.300 --> 37:47.100
OF

37:47.100 --> 37:49.100
ENGAGEMENT ARE--

37:47.100 --> 37:49.100
IT'S A BIG [bleep] DEAL,

37:47.100 --> 37:49.100
AND

37:49.100 --> 37:51.233
IF I'M GONNA MAKE DECISIONS,

37:49.100 --> 37:51.233
LET

37:49.100 --> 37:51.233
ME MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT MY

37:51.233 --> 37:53.333
COMPANY.

37:51.233 --> 37:53.333
WHEN WE MAKE AN AGREEMENT

37:51.233 --> 37:53.333
AND

37:53.333 --> 37:56.033
WE'RE GONNA WORK TOGETHER,

37:53.333 --> 37:56.033
I SHOULDN'T BE CHANGING

37:53.333 --> 37:56.033
THINGS,

37:56.033 --> 37:58.633
AND YOU SHOULDN'T BE CHANGING

37:56.033 --> 37:58.633
THINGS, 'CAUSE IT VIOLATES OUR

37:58.633 --> 38:01.967
TRUST.

37:58.633 --> 38:01.967
I FEEL LIKE YOU INCLUDE ME

37:58.633 --> 38:01.967
WHEN

38:01.967 --> 38:03.900
YOU NEED TO...

38:01.967 --> 38:03.900
MM-HMM.

38:03.900 --> 38:06.900
AND DON'T INCLUDE ME WHEN

38:03.900 --> 38:06.900
IT'S CONVENIENT.

38:06.900 --> 38:10.200
YEAH, I MEAN, I COULD SEE

38:06.900 --> 38:10.200
HOW

38:06.900 --> 38:10.200
WE MIGHT HAVE GONE ROGUE, AND

38:06.900 --> 38:10.200
IT

38:10.200 --> 38:11.900
SHOULD HAVE BEEN A

38:10.200 --> 38:11.900
CONVERSATION

38:10.200 --> 38:11.900
BEFORE WE--

38:11.900 --> 38:14.300
YEAH.

38:11.900 --> 38:14.300
I HAVE 6,000 EMPLOYEES, AND

38:14.300 --> 38:16.867
I WANT THEM TO HAVE THEIR OWN

38:14.300 --> 38:16.867
MINDS AND TAKE CHANCES, BUT

38:14.300 --> 38:16.867
WHEN

38:16.867 --> 38:18.333
WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT..

38:16.867 --> 38:18.333
MM-HMM.

38:18.333 --> 38:19.767
AND WE SHAKE HANDS...

38:18.333 --> 38:19.767
MM-HMM.

38:19.767 --> 38:21.733
I DON'T EVER WANT TO WONDER

38:19.767 --> 38:21.733
IF THAT'S GONNA CHANGE.

38:21.733 --> 38:25.433
YOU KNOW, AS MUCH AS I

38:21.733 --> 38:25.433
MIGHT

38:21.733 --> 38:25.433
BE A CONTROL FREAK AND MY TEAM

38:25.433 --> 38:27.367
SEES THAT AND I HAVE THAT

38:25.433 --> 38:27.367
FEEDBACK AND I KNOW I NEED TO

38:27.367 --> 38:29.500
WORK ON THAT, I CAN BE

38:27.367 --> 38:29.500
HUMBLED BY THIS.

38:29.500 --> 38:31.933
I KNOW WHEN I'VE DONE

38:29.500 --> 38:31.933
SOMETHING

38:29.500 --> 38:31.933
AND MAYBE THERE IS A BETTER

38:29.500 --> 38:31.933
WAY

38:31.933 --> 38:36.267
TO DO IT, AND, YES, 100%, MY

38:31.933 --> 38:36.267
APOLOGIES TO DEREK AND TO YOU.

38:36.267 --> 38:39.067
I'M A VERY CARING PERSON.

38:36.267 --> 38:39.067
I WOULD NEVER SET OUT TO DO

38:39.067 --> 38:42.300
ANYTHING THAT WOULD "A," PUT

38:39.067 --> 38:42.300
MY

38:39.067 --> 38:42.300
COMPANY AT HARM OR PEOPLE IN

38:42.300 --> 38:43.800
HARM THAT I WORK WITH.

38:42.300 --> 38:43.800
RIGHT.

38:43.800 --> 38:46.767
AND I DO SOMETIMES GET TOO

38:43.800 --> 38:46.767
STUCK IN MY HEAD AND STUBBORN.

38:46.767 --> 38:48.767
I KNOW MY FAULTS.

38:46.767 --> 38:48.767
BUT THAT'S WHAT I LIKE

38:46.767 --> 38:48.767
ABOUT

38:48.767 --> 38:50.100
YOU.

38:48.767 --> 38:50.100
SEE?

38:50.100 --> 38:53.800
IF YOU CAN JUST LET GO A

38:50.100 --> 38:53.800
LITTLE

38:50.100 --> 38:53.800
BUT BE THE DYNAMIC PERSON THAT

38:53.800 --> 38:55.200
YOU ARE...

38:53.800 --> 38:55.200
MM-HMM.

38:55.200 --> 38:57.000
THEN WE'RE GONNA MAKE A LOT

38:55.200 --> 38:57.000
OF MONEY.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.100
WE'RE GONNA MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.100
YOU AND I ARE GONNA BE FINE.

38:59.100 --> 39:01.233
I HAVE THICK SKIN.

38:59.100 --> 39:01.233
I'M USED TO ENTREPRENEURS LIKE

39:01.233 --> 39:02.567
YOU.

39:01.233 --> 39:02.567
I'M GONNA GO OUT IN THE

39:02.567 --> 39:04.200
WAREHOUSE AND SEE THE GUYS,

39:02.567 --> 39:04.200
AND

39:02.567 --> 39:04.200
I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU IN A

39:04.200 --> 39:04.867
LITTLE BIT.

39:04.867 --> 39:08.333
OKAY, THANK YOU.

39:04.867 --> 39:08.333
YEP.

39:08.333 --> 39:10.467
COMING UP...

39:08.333 --> 39:10.467
WHEN I FIRST MET YOU GUYS,

39:10.467 --> 39:13.100
I TOLD YOU WE WERE GONNA GO

39:10.467 --> 39:13.100
FROM

39:10.467 --> 39:13.100
$500,000 TO $10 MILLION.

39:13.100 --> 39:13.767
THIS IS SO PAINFUL.

39:13.767 --> 39:14.600
IT WAS ALMOST LIKE CUTTING

39:13.767 --> 39:14.600
OFF A

39:14.600 --> 39:16.500
LIMB.

39:25.400 --> 39:26.800
THIS IS OUR MACHINE RIGHT

39:25.400 --> 39:26.800
HERE, RIGHT NOW.

39:26.800 --> 39:28.233
RIGHT.

39:26.800 --> 39:28.233
HOW MANY DO YOU GUYS GET DONE

39:26.800 --> 39:28.233
IN

39:28.233 --> 39:29.867
A DAY?

39:28.233 --> 39:29.867
WE CAN PROBABLY GET 1,200.

39:29.867 --> 39:32.500
WITH THIS NEW MACHINERY,

39:29.867 --> 39:32.500
YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO GET 10

39:32.500 --> 39:36.100
TIMES THAT DONE--50 A MINUTE.

40:50.933 --> 40:55.167
[applause]

40:50.933 --> 40:55.167
YOU KNOW, ROBIN, WHEN WE FIRST

40:55.167 --> 40:58.567
MET, THE PRODUCT WAS SOLD IN

40:55.167 --> 40:58.567
MORE OF A NICHE-Y SPACE.

40:58.567 --> 41:01.700
IT DID WELL, $500,000 A YEAR,

40:58.567 --> 41:01.700
BUT AS WE'VE REDESIGNED THIS

41:01.700 --> 41:04.733
PACKAGING, WE CLARIFIED THE

41:01.700 --> 41:04.733
NAME, WE ESTABLISHED AND

41:04.733 --> 41:07.700
IDENTIFIED, WE'RE CLEAR

41:04.733 --> 41:07.700
ABOUT THE INGREDIENTS.

41:07.700 --> 41:10.500
WE'RE NOW TELLING THE STORY,

41:07.700 --> 41:10.500
ESPECIALLY THE BEST ONE--

41:10.500 --> 41:12.500
"MADE IN THE U.S.A."

41:10.500 --> 41:12.500
IT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE.

41:12.500 --> 41:14.300
FROM ACROSS THE ROOM, YOU CAN

41:12.500 --> 41:14.300
SEE THE BRAND.

41:14.300 --> 41:16.000
YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE

41:14.300 --> 41:16.000
PRODUCT IS.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.967
THERE'S NO QUESTIONING.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.967
THIS PACKAGE GOT US TO

41:16.000 --> 41:18.967

THIS PACKAGE GETS US TO

41:18.967 --> 41:21.033
$10 MILLION.

41:21.033 --> 41:22.800
HOW HARD WAS THIS PROCESS FOR

41:21.033 --> 41:22.800
YOU?

41:22.800 --> 41:25.567
THIS WAS SO PAINFUL.

41:22.800 --> 41:25.567
IT WAS ALMOST LIKE CUTTING

41:22.800 --> 41:25.567
OFF A

41:25.567 --> 41:28.200
LIMB.

41:25.567 --> 41:28.200
TO BE ABLE TO STEP BACK AND

41:28.200 --> 41:30.967
REALIZE THAT I HAD TO DO IT

41:28.200 --> 41:30.967
FOR

41:28.200 --> 41:30.967
THE COMPANY, AND THEN SEE HOW

41:30.967 --> 41:33.433
GREAT IT IS AND HOW MUCH

41:30.967 --> 41:33.433
BETTER

41:30.967 --> 41:33.433
IT IS?

41:33.433 --> 41:35.433
IT'S AMAZING.

41:33.433 --> 41:35.433
I GET IT NOW.

41:35.433 --> 41:38.300
PEOPLE WILL NOW KNOW ECO-ME

41:35.433 --> 41:38.300
INSTEAD OF BEING, "IS IT BILL?

41:38.300 --> 41:39.833

41:38.300 --> 41:39.833
I GET IT.

41:39.833 --> 41:42.233
AND I'M PROUD OF YOU,

41:39.833 --> 41:42.233
ROBIN.

41:39.833 --> 41:42.233
I'M GLAD THAT YOU SEE THAT

41:39.833 --> 41:42.233
THIS

41:42.233 --> 41:46.267
WAS REALLY A TRANSFORMATION OF

41:42.233 --> 41:46.267
ROBIN AS A LEADER, AS MUCH AS

41:42.233 --> 41:46.267
IT

41:46.267 --> 41:49.000
WAS A TRANSFORMATION ABOUT

41:46.267 --> 41:49.000
ECO-ME AS A COMPANY.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.933
AND THE FIRE THAT YOU HAVE IN

41:49.000 --> 41:51.933
YOUR BELLY IS THE REASON THAT

41:51.933 --> 41:54.733
THE BUSINESS HAS BEEN ABLE TO

41:51.933 --> 41:54.733
SURVIVE ALL THIS TIME.

41:54.733 --> 41:56.067
THANK YOU.

41:54.733 --> 41:56.067
IF YOU CAN JUST GET THAT

41:56.067 --> 41:58.233

41:56.067 --> 41:58.233
DIRECTION THAT TAKES US TO THE

41:58.233 --> 42:00.200
NEXT LEVEL, I'M CONFIDENT

GET US THERE.

42:00.200 --> 42:01.967
WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

42:00.200 --> 42:01.967
I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT

42:00.200 --> 42:01.967

42:01.967 --> 42:03.867
THIS HAS BEEN A GREAT

42:03.867 --> 42:07.733
EXPERIENCE AT ECO-ME.

42:03.867 --> 42:07.733
I ALWAYS FOCUS ON PEOPLE,

42:07.733 --> 42:10.867

42:07.733 --> 42:10.867
THIS CASE, THE PEOPLE HAVE

42:07.733 --> 42:10.867

42:10.867 --> 42:13.767
A REAL TURN.

42:26.667 --> 42:29.700
