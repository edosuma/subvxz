00:00.375 --> 00:02.753
Previously on Elementary...
WATSON:
Hannah Gregson just found

00:02.753 --> 00:03.962
her roommate strangled
in her house.

00:03.962 --> 00:07.132
Getting away with murder
is an incredible feeling.

00:07.132 --> 00:09.092
(grunting and groaning)

00:09.092 --> 00:10.636
Special Agent Mallick.
HOLMES:
So you're covering

00:10.636 --> 00:12.262
the Michael Rowan
investigation for the Bureau?

00:12.262 --> 00:16.141
You think I killed Michael. Why?
In a word-- obsession.

00:16.141 --> 00:18.894
I spent the better part of today
thinking that Michael's killer

00:18.894 --> 00:20.646
was Special Agent Mallick.

00:20.646 --> 00:23.440
No. It's Hannah,

00:23.440 --> 00:24.691
your daughter.

00:24.691 --> 00:26.401
You have to tell the FBI.

00:26.401 --> 00:29.947
You're the door that this
lunatic walked through, okay?

00:29.947 --> 00:31.990
If it weren't for you,

00:31.990 --> 00:34.201
Maddie Williams
would be alive today,

00:34.201 --> 00:36.495
and my little girl
wouldn't be a killer.

00:36.495 --> 00:37.788
HANNAH:
I never meant

00:37.788 --> 00:39.581
for any of this to
come down on Joan.

00:39.581 --> 00:41.792
What if we didn't do anything?
Just took our chances,

00:41.792 --> 00:43.919
see what happens?
MALLICK:
Your partner--

00:43.919 --> 00:45.379
he confessed to the murder.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.506
That's wrong.
Sherlock did not kill anyone.

00:47.506 --> 00:50.550
I'm the only one who could
confess without going to prison.

00:50.550 --> 00:52.844
MALLICK:
The Brits won't extradite him.
They made that very clear.

00:52.844 --> 00:55.347
He isn't allowed to set food
in the U.S. ever again.

00:55.347 --> 00:58.600
Sherlock Holmes isn't
America's problem anymore.

00:58.600 --> 01:01.853
(siren whooping)

01:15.409 --> 01:17.786
(whirring)

01:47.524 --> 01:51.028
HOLMES:
Bernardo "Beppo" Pugliesi.

01:51.028 --> 01:53.530
Welcome to Baker Street.

01:53.530 --> 01:57.326
Well, we both know why
you're here, so have at it.

02:21.391 --> 02:24.061
HOLMES:
The Black Pearl
of the Borgias.

02:24.061 --> 02:26.897
Centerpiece of Lucrezia Borgia's
favorite necklace.

02:26.897 --> 02:29.149
You stole it from a collector
in Rome little over a year ago.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.068
Quite a haul.

02:31.068 --> 02:33.779
If only you hadn't committed
a completely unrelated crime

02:33.779 --> 02:35.238
just one day later.

02:35.238 --> 02:37.449
Stabbed a man in a bar fight.

02:37.449 --> 02:39.451
And when the police

02:39.451 --> 02:41.370
tracked you to your brother's
ceramics factory,

02:41.370 --> 02:44.873
you hid the pearl in one
of exactly 1,000 busts

02:44.873 --> 02:49.086
he planned to sell at the
upcoming royal wedding.

02:49.086 --> 02:52.798
They were so ugly, of course,
he only managed to sell six.

02:52.798 --> 02:55.217
How do you know so much
about me, huh?

02:55.217 --> 02:57.344
You're a thief of some renown.

02:57.344 --> 02:59.304
You were long suspected
of stealing the pearl,

02:59.304 --> 03:01.098
but no one could ever prove it.

03:01.098 --> 03:03.517
Several weeks ago,
when someone

03:03.517 --> 03:05.394
started breaking into homes
and stealing nothing,

03:05.394 --> 03:07.729
but leaving a trail
of ceramic destruction,

03:07.729 --> 03:09.731
it all became clear.

03:09.731 --> 03:12.025
Your brother
sold six busts.

03:12.025 --> 03:15.737
After you were paroled,
you destroyed five of them.

03:15.737 --> 03:18.532
I couldn't be sure the pearl
was in that one, of course.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.784
You could've recovered it
at your last stop.

03:20.784 --> 03:22.285
But I bought it
all the same.

03:22.285 --> 03:24.579
I made quite
a show of it.

03:24.579 --> 03:27.374
I assumed you'd be keeping an
eye on the woman who owned it.

03:27.374 --> 03:29.709
Who are you?

03:29.709 --> 03:32.421
I'm the man who's going
to bring you to justice.

03:32.421 --> 03:34.631
Typically,

03:34.631 --> 03:36.967
I don't find your brand
of criminal worth my time.

03:36.967 --> 03:39.428
But when the owner of the
fifth bust discovered you

03:39.428 --> 03:42.472
in his home, you strangled him.

03:43.932 --> 03:45.934
That won't do, Beppo.

03:47.727 --> 03:51.189
Do you really think
you can stop me from leaving?

03:51.189 --> 03:54.151
(laughs)
I know I can.

03:54.151 --> 03:55.861
I mean, I'd much rather you

03:55.861 --> 03:57.529
surrendered peacefully,
of course.

03:57.529 --> 03:59.030
I suffer from

03:59.030 --> 04:01.408
post-concussion syndrome.

04:01.408 --> 04:04.828
A single blow to the head could
do terrible damage to my brain.

04:04.828 --> 04:06.705
Well, the thing is...

04:08.540 --> 04:11.084
I don't think you're
going to land a single blow.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.685
WOMAN:
I bet the owner's
gonna be happy

04:28.685 --> 04:30.729
to have that back.

04:30.729 --> 04:32.314
That's the only part of
the case I don't like.

04:32.314 --> 04:34.941
Jacopo Cremonesi ran
the Calabrian Mafia

04:34.941 --> 04:36.568
for a stretch in the '80s.

04:36.568 --> 04:38.528
This pearl was paid
for with blood.

04:38.528 --> 04:39.946
Watson.

04:41.031 --> 04:43.366
Nice of you to join us, Doc.

04:43.366 --> 04:45.202
I was working today
in Whitehall, remember?

04:45.202 --> 04:47.537
The Lucas homicide?
Just as well.

04:47.537 --> 04:50.665
Your partner obviously
didn't need any help tonight.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.876
Notice the absence
of bullet holes.

04:52.876 --> 04:54.419
When you don't
shoot the suspect,

04:54.419 --> 04:56.129
you can actually
send him to prison.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.672
Once again, just
because I'm American

04:57.672 --> 04:59.799
does not mean
that I love guns.

04:59.799 --> 05:02.052
Right. I suppose you don't call
football "soccer," either.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.053
(stammers)

05:06.056 --> 05:07.849
Just a bit of colored glass.

05:07.849 --> 05:10.060
A fake?
No, not exactly.

05:10.060 --> 05:13.313
The Black Pearl of the Borgias
was always made of glass.

05:13.313 --> 05:16.149
How else could Lucrezia Borgia
have hidden this inside it?

05:18.693 --> 05:20.904
Historians have long
suspected her

05:20.904 --> 05:23.573
in the poisoning deaths of
many of her family's enemies.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.659
When she fell out of favor

05:25.659 --> 05:27.661
with certain members of
the Vatican, it's rumored

05:27.661 --> 05:30.497
that she was urged to dispose
of her favorite murder weapon,

05:30.497 --> 05:32.874
a hollow ring

05:32.874 --> 05:36.086
which she used to put poison

05:36.086 --> 05:37.587
in her victims' drinks.

05:37.587 --> 05:40.715
Looks like she found
a way to keep it.

05:40.715 --> 05:42.717
My God, Holmes.

05:42.717 --> 05:46.596
You didn't get the goods on
one murderer tonight, but two.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.348
WATSON:
You're an idiot.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.724
If he had hit you...
He didn't.

05:49.724 --> 05:52.018
Yeah, but if he had...
But he didn't.

05:52.018 --> 05:54.854
Whitehall. The murder
of Eduardo Lucas.

05:54.854 --> 05:56.398
You didn't tell me,
uh, what happened.

05:56.398 --> 05:58.149
It's over. We closed it.

05:58.149 --> 05:59.734
Your hunch was correct?

05:59.734 --> 06:02.737
The killer wasn't Lady Hilda.
It was Eduardo's wife.

06:02.737 --> 06:04.573
She thought
he was having an affair.

06:04.573 --> 06:06.199
We found blood evidence
on a carpet.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.118
Outstanding.

06:08.118 --> 06:11.162
Yeah. I'm sure DCI Jones
will be very impressed.

06:11.162 --> 06:12.956
Watson, we've been
over this many times.

06:12.956 --> 06:14.749
Athelney Jones
is not your enemy.

06:14.749 --> 06:17.335
Do you hear the way she
calls me "Doc"? It's a dig.

06:17.335 --> 06:20.255
Is she a bit
of an Ameri-phobe? Yeah.
A bit?

06:20.255 --> 06:22.716
The point is, she respects
your work, which is outstanding.

06:22.716 --> 06:25.135
Think of the year
that we've had so far.

06:25.135 --> 06:26.803
We've had
the Boscombe Valley Mystery,

06:26.803 --> 06:28.638
that Adventure at Abbey Grange.

06:28.638 --> 06:30.307
We're just as productive
as we ever were in New York,

06:30.307 --> 06:32.225
if not more so.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.811
Keep going like this,
I might get knighted.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.313
You could be a dame.

06:38.982 --> 06:41.860
WOMAN:
Truth be told, it still hurts.

06:41.860 --> 06:44.863
Not as much as it did, but
there's still an ache, you know?

06:44.863 --> 06:47.198
Tonight? I can't.

06:47.198 --> 06:49.576
I'm going to a birthday party.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.536
My friend's daughter
is turning six.

06:51.536 --> 06:53.622
I just bought her
a very posh doll.

06:53.622 --> 06:55.040
MAN:
Miss?
Wets itself and everything.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.791
Excuse me, miss?
Are you talking to me?

06:56.791 --> 07:00.503
(screaming)

07:06.635 --> 07:08.428
(screaming continues; sizzling)

07:27.781 --> 07:29.199
NURSE: They've got her full
of hydromorphone,

07:29.199 --> 07:31.076
so she's sleeping now.
I shouldn't disturb her.

07:31.076 --> 07:32.786
I don't think
she got a good look

07:32.786 --> 07:35.205
at the man anyway.
What, did she say that?

07:35.205 --> 07:37.374
No. Ms. Quinn was in shock
when they wheeled her in,

07:37.374 --> 07:41.961
wasn't speaking
at all, but, well...

07:41.961 --> 07:45.590
Right. Hard to
imagine she saw much.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.676
NURSE:
She was a beautiful girl.
Such a shame.

07:47.676 --> 07:49.302
Could hardly recognize her.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.763
You know the victim?
You probably do, too,

07:51.763 --> 07:54.099
unless you fancy real news.

07:54.099 --> 07:55.892
She's Lola Quinn.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.686
She's a minor celebrity
in these parts,

07:57.686 --> 07:59.646
one of the last
tabloid models.

07:59.646 --> 08:02.273
Metro Flash still runs
them on page three.

08:02.273 --> 08:05.485
Lola's been a favorite
the past few years.
(phone ringing)

08:05.485 --> 08:07.237
Sorry. Have to get that.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.365
Excuse me, do you
have a moment?

08:10.365 --> 08:12.409
Yes.
Athelney Jones.

08:12.409 --> 08:15.245
This is Sherlock Holmes
and Joan Watson.

08:15.245 --> 08:17.288
Are you Ms. Quinn's
doctor?
Well, I'm one of them.

08:17.288 --> 08:19.749
Uh, Garret Halsey. I'm head
of plastic surgery here.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.376
How is she?

08:21.376 --> 08:23.753
Well, she's stable
now, but...

08:23.753 --> 08:26.172
she has first- and second-degree
chemical burns

08:26.172 --> 08:28.049
all over her face.

08:28.049 --> 08:30.844
She might lose the left eye,
and then there's the risk

08:30.844 --> 08:33.346
of infection.
Please tell me

08:33.346 --> 08:35.348
you have a lead on the bastard
who did this to her.

08:35.348 --> 08:36.975
I'm afraid not.

08:36.975 --> 08:39.185
The whole thing
was caught on CCTV,

08:39.185 --> 08:42.355
but there's nothing on tape
to help us make an I.D.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.898
Part of why we came.

08:43.898 --> 08:45.442
We were hoping
she could describe him.

08:45.442 --> 08:47.360
Do us a favor.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.820
She wakes up,
give us a call.

08:48.820 --> 08:50.238
We're gonna want
to talk to her.

08:50.238 --> 08:51.990
With all due respect,

08:51.990 --> 08:53.742
you lot have got
to do something about this.

08:53.742 --> 08:56.411
This plague. I get
called in to consult

08:56.411 --> 08:58.496
on another acid attack
every couple of months.

08:58.496 --> 09:00.248
It's bloody madness.

09:00.248 --> 09:02.709
We're gonna find the
person who did this.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.669
I promise you that.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.504
I'm afraid he's right.

09:06.504 --> 09:08.548
The city can't take
much more of this.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.300
There have been what,
over 200 acid attacks

09:10.300 --> 09:11.718
in London this year?

09:11.718 --> 09:13.720
First, it was
the religious zealots.

09:13.720 --> 09:14.637
Then the gangs picked it up.

09:14.637 --> 09:16.139
Now we've got muggers

09:16.139 --> 09:18.057
dousing people
for phones and handbags.

09:18.057 --> 09:19.893
Outcry's bound
to get worse

09:19.893 --> 09:21.686
now that a famous face
has been ruined.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.772
(elevator bell dings)
We need a quick closure.

09:23.772 --> 09:25.190
Think you can
give me that, Holmes?

09:25.190 --> 09:26.524
Doc.

09:31.196 --> 09:32.864
(door opens)

09:33.948 --> 09:36.117
(laughs)

09:36.117 --> 09:39.245
Detective Bell,
my favorite cop.

09:39.245 --> 09:41.414
Tony.

09:43.291 --> 09:46.085
So, why'd you call me in
this time, huh?

09:46.085 --> 09:48.546
BELL:
I've been keeping an eye
on your social media.

09:48.546 --> 09:49.923
Saw you were getting married.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.591
Wanted to say congrats
in person.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.259
Wasn't easy, you know?

09:53.259 --> 09:56.596
Falling in love again after
Yancy left me the way she did?

09:56.596 --> 09:59.224
Your wife didn't leave you,
Tony. She was murdered.

09:59.224 --> 10:01.100
You find her body
and not tell me, Detective?

10:01.100 --> 10:03.394
'Cause, uh, unless you did,
she left me,

10:03.394 --> 10:05.647
just like I told you a year ago.

10:05.647 --> 10:08.441
(sighs)

10:08.441 --> 10:10.902
I wanted to talk to you about
the anger management classes.

10:10.902 --> 10:12.570
This again?

10:12.570 --> 10:14.989
Seriously? Just 'cause a guy
takes some classes

10:14.989 --> 10:16.616
doesn't make him a killer.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.743
You were sentenced
to those classes.

10:18.743 --> 10:20.870
Yancy went to her sister's
to get away from you.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.789
You kicked her
front door in.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.707
I never laid a hand
on either of 'em.

10:25.917 --> 10:28.419
What's it gonna take
to convince you?

10:28.419 --> 10:32.131
I didn't kill my wife.

10:32.131 --> 10:33.675
I believe you.

10:36.052 --> 10:41.140
Your fiancée's last name,
"Tugnutt," isn't too common.

10:41.140 --> 10:44.060
When I saw it, I remembered
a double homicide

10:44.060 --> 10:46.396
at a Tugnutt Stationery
last year.

10:46.396 --> 10:49.566
The detective who caught it
liked a guy named Ray Tugnutt.

10:49.566 --> 10:52.360
The two vics, you see--
they were Ray's parents.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.779
A few months before, they
were supposed to retire

10:54.779 --> 10:56.239
and give their store to him,

10:56.239 --> 10:58.449
but then
they changed their minds.

10:58.449 --> 11:01.119
He got so angry,
he trashed the place.

11:01.119 --> 11:03.788
Got himself arrested
and sentenced to--

11:03.788 --> 11:06.249
wait for it--

11:06.249 --> 11:08.167
anger management classes.

11:08.167 --> 11:11.337
That's where you got
to know him, right?

11:11.337 --> 11:13.506
At some point,
he introduced you to his cousin.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.758
Now you're marrying her.

11:15.758 --> 11:19.387
I don't know which of you idiots
saw Strangers on a Train.

11:19.387 --> 11:22.140
I was always partial
to Throw Momma myself,

11:22.140 --> 11:24.350
but, obviously,
you traded murders.

11:24.350 --> 11:27.353
You killed his parents,
he killed Yancy.

11:27.353 --> 11:30.064
I'm talking to him next.

11:30.064 --> 11:34.777
Question is, if there's a shot
at a deal with the D.A.,

11:34.777 --> 11:37.322
which of you
is gonna flip first?

11:41.659 --> 11:44.495
Got him with five
days to spare.

11:44.495 --> 11:46.873
I remember a few months ago
when the federal hiring freeze

11:46.873 --> 11:48.875
slowed everything down
for you and the Marshals...

11:48.875 --> 11:50.084
My bags were
literally packed.

11:50.084 --> 11:51.669
Could you blame me
for being ticked?

11:51.669 --> 11:53.504
I said, "Marcus, think of
all the extra time

11:53.504 --> 11:55.465
"you're gonna have to nail
that piece of garbage.

11:55.465 --> 11:57.216
Think of how good
that's gonna feel."

11:57.216 --> 11:58.551
(laughing):
You were right, okay?

11:58.551 --> 12:00.595
It feels great.

12:00.595 --> 12:02.889
You sure you still want to go?

12:02.889 --> 12:05.558
I mean, look at everything
you're missing.

12:05.558 --> 12:08.227
The smells,
the stale coffee...

12:08.227 --> 12:10.855
fluorescent light bulbs
that won't stay lit.

12:10.855 --> 12:12.649
Ooh.

12:12.649 --> 12:14.776
(laughs)

12:14.776 --> 12:16.819
"Because every good
marshal needs one."

12:16.819 --> 12:18.988
Who's that from?

12:18.988 --> 12:21.366
Sherlock and Joan.

12:21.366 --> 12:24.869
Yeah. Should've known.

12:24.869 --> 12:27.288
Congrats, okay?

12:27.288 --> 12:29.624
WATSON:
I really miss Captain Gregson.

12:29.624 --> 12:31.584
He was never anything
but respectful,

12:31.584 --> 12:33.211
even before I became
a detective.

12:33.211 --> 12:35.046
But this DCI, I swear to God,

12:35.046 --> 12:37.924
if she calls me "Doc"
just one more time...

12:37.924 --> 12:39.968
I don't think I ever gave you
enough credit

12:39.968 --> 12:42.428
for your move to New York.

12:42.428 --> 12:45.932
I mean, working with police
you'd never met before.

12:45.932 --> 12:48.226
It's a lot harder
than I thought it'd be.

12:48.226 --> 12:49.602
What can I say?

12:49.602 --> 12:51.562
I am pretty great.

12:53.982 --> 12:55.775
Archie.

12:55.775 --> 12:58.695
Those are not to play with.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.154
(chuckles)

13:01.698 --> 13:04.075
I don't need an alibi, do I?

13:04.075 --> 13:05.493
Acid in the face.

13:05.493 --> 13:07.203
Sort of my M.O.

13:07.203 --> 13:10.498
Pretty sure that Lola Quinn
is not a serial killer.

13:11.833 --> 13:13.501
KITTY:
Poor thing.

13:13.501 --> 13:15.628
WATSON:
Do you want to work
this case with us?

13:15.628 --> 13:17.296
Wouldn't mind the company.

13:17.296 --> 13:20.383
Sorry. I've got my hands full
at work.

13:20.383 --> 13:23.011
There's no shortage
of missing girls out there.

13:23.011 --> 13:26.180
And all of my free time
goes to this guy.

13:26.180 --> 13:28.141
(toys clattering)

13:29.851 --> 13:31.894
So when are you gonna tell
Sherlock?

13:31.894 --> 13:33.021
Tell him what?

13:33.021 --> 13:34.814
That you aren't happy in London.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.357
I didn't say I wasn't happy.

13:36.357 --> 13:37.942
I just said I was having
a problem at work.

13:37.942 --> 13:39.485
Then explain the hair.

13:39.485 --> 13:40.737
W-What?

13:40.737 --> 13:42.363
I love it, don't get me wrong.

13:42.363 --> 13:44.365
But I know a woman looking
to shake things up

13:44.365 --> 13:45.867
when I see one.
Yeah, I'm sure you do.

13:45.867 --> 13:47.535
Every time you
look in the mirror.

13:47.535 --> 13:49.787
I did this on a dare,
and you know it.

13:49.787 --> 13:51.539
You loved it here
in the beginning.

13:51.539 --> 13:53.374
I mean, who wouldn't?
But I don't think

13:53.374 --> 13:56.169
I've seen you truly happy
in quite some time.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.171
I'm fine.

14:01.174 --> 14:04.510
Maybe it isn't New York
you're missing,

14:04.510 --> 14:06.846
but the idea
of starting a family.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.848
You put a lot
of work into it,

14:08.848 --> 14:11.100
then you walked away.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.311
I didn't just walk away.

14:13.311 --> 14:15.354
I decided long before I thought
about moving to London

14:15.354 --> 14:17.190
that I was not
going to adopt a baby.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.983
The work we do,
it's just too dangerous.

14:18.983 --> 14:20.735
Michael Rowan proved that.
(phone ringing)

14:20.735 --> 14:22.487
Hey.

14:22.487 --> 14:24.947
HOLMES: The getaway vehicle
used in the acid attack,

14:24.947 --> 14:26.949
it's been found.

14:28.659 --> 14:31.120
(siren wails)

14:34.373 --> 14:36.876
(dog barking nearby)

14:36.876 --> 14:38.544
Watson.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.463
We're sure it's
the same moped?

14:40.463 --> 14:42.757
There's no question.
It's over here.

14:42.757 --> 14:45.718
I thought no one at the scene
got a look at the license plate.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.178
That's true.

14:47.178 --> 14:49.764
But it's the same make,
model, color.

14:49.764 --> 14:52.058
And then there are
the handlebars.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.810
Or lack thereof.

14:53.810 --> 14:56.479
They've been dissolved
with sulfuric acid.

14:56.479 --> 14:58.231
That's one way to get rid
of fingerprints.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.191
I'd call it
an abundance of caution.

15:02.485 --> 15:04.737
WATSON:
These are from a midsize car.

15:04.737 --> 15:05.947
Did our guys make them?

15:05.947 --> 15:06.989
So it must've been him.

15:06.989 --> 15:08.699
It rained last night.

15:08.699 --> 15:10.493
I suppose he left it here
in advance.

15:10.493 --> 15:14.122
He must have always intended
to ditch the moped here.

15:14.122 --> 15:15.706
That's a pretty complicated plan
for a mugging.

15:15.706 --> 15:18.084
What is that smell?
Do you smell that?

15:18.084 --> 15:20.503
It smells like a forest.

15:20.503 --> 15:22.713
No. On top of that.

15:22.713 --> 15:26.926
I'm getting... dirt.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.845
With hints of other dirt.

15:36.519 --> 15:39.147
He poured acid over everything
in her purse?

15:40.439 --> 15:41.899
Including her phone.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.863
Was he determined to destroy
all evidence of his crime?

15:46.863 --> 15:48.906
I would think the phone
and the wallet

15:48.906 --> 15:50.658
were the whole point
of the crime.

15:50.658 --> 15:51.868
(phone ringing)

15:51.868 --> 15:54.370
Holmes, what have you got?

15:54.370 --> 15:56.497
Progress. We found some of
Lola Quinn's belongings.

15:56.497 --> 15:58.666
This wasn't a robbery
after all.

15:58.666 --> 15:59.876
We're going to have
to re-approach

15:59.876 --> 16:01.169
from a different angle.

16:01.169 --> 16:03.045
Doesn't sound like progress.

16:03.045 --> 16:04.505
Take heart, Chief Inspector.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.549
A motive more personal
than greed

16:06.549 --> 16:08.759
should narrow
our focus considerably.

16:08.759 --> 16:11.387
We need to speak to Lola Quinn
as soon as she wakes up.

16:11.387 --> 16:13.222
She may have some idea
who wanted to harm her.

16:13.222 --> 16:15.641
There's the problem, I'm afraid.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.894
We're never going to get
to speak to Ms. Quinn.

16:17.894 --> 16:19.562
She's dead.

16:20.938 --> 16:22.231
Doctor said she was stable.

16:22.231 --> 16:24.108
She didn't die from her wounds.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.321
She jumped down a lift shaft

16:28.321 --> 16:30.948
that's under repair
at the hospital.

16:30.948 --> 16:33.951
I suppose the thought of losing
her looks and her livelihood

16:33.951 --> 16:36.204
was too much to bear.

16:36.204 --> 16:40.875
So, if you're right, if someone
was just out to hurt her...

16:40.875 --> 16:43.836
they did a far better job of it
than they could have imagined.

16:51.552 --> 16:53.095
JONES: It's official.
Lola Quinn's moved

16:53.095 --> 16:54.388
from page three to page one.

16:54.388 --> 16:56.015
I'm getting calls
every five minutes

16:56.015 --> 16:57.683
from bosses I never knew I had.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.393
The press is breathing down
all our necks now.

16:59.393 --> 17:01.437
Yeah, we saw the
mob of reporters

17:01.437 --> 17:02.855
out front this morning.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.523
JONES:
It's an absolute frenzy.

17:04.523 --> 17:06.901
They've got the public
in a lather, too.

17:06.901 --> 17:08.527
Another day goes by
without an arrest,

17:08.527 --> 17:10.112
I half expect Elton John
will rewrite the lyrics

17:10.112 --> 17:11.948
to "Candle in the Wind" again.

17:11.948 --> 17:13.282
HOLMES: We don't need any
additional motivation.

17:13.282 --> 17:14.700
Ms. Quinn's case
has our full attention.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.702
A fat lot of good
that's done us so far.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.788
Everything they're saying
in the papers is true.

17:18.788 --> 17:20.706
We're nowhere.
It's been one day.

17:20.706 --> 17:22.667
We didn't find anything useful
at the crime scene,

17:22.667 --> 17:25.127
and CCTV didn't give us
anything to go on.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.879
We have the getaway vehicle,
we've got Ms. Quinn's

17:26.879 --> 17:28.714
stolen belongings,
and we've got a fingerprint

17:28.714 --> 17:30.341
which may well belong
to her assailant.

17:30.341 --> 17:32.093
A partial print, incomplete.

17:32.093 --> 17:33.511
And since it wasn't
in the system,

17:33.511 --> 17:35.388
it's of no use
for the time being.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.931
Nevertheless,
the fact that it was found

17:36.931 --> 17:39.517
on Ms. Quinn's handbag,
which was still stuffed

17:39.517 --> 17:41.811
with cash and credit cards,
is very telling.

17:41.811 --> 17:44.188
This acid attack is not
like all the others.

17:44.188 --> 17:46.607
He wasn't driven by ideology
or greed.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.651
Lola Quinn was targeted in a way

17:48.651 --> 17:50.569
that would disguise
a personal motive.

17:50.569 --> 17:53.739
HOLMES:
So we've lined up interviews
with her friends and family.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.741
Someone will know
who wanted to hurt her.

17:55.741 --> 17:58.536
DCC Forensics may be
a step ahead of you there.

17:58.536 --> 18:00.121
There was a threat made
against her online?

18:00.121 --> 18:01.497
The techs were able

18:01.497 --> 18:02.873
to access her e-mail.

18:02.873 --> 18:04.583
Last month, she got in a spat

18:04.583 --> 18:06.794
with a paparazzo
named Derek Casey.

18:06.794 --> 18:09.130
Lola sent him a note
out of the blue.

18:09.130 --> 18:12.008
Called him a tosser for
following her with his camera.

18:12.008 --> 18:14.051
He didn't take it so well.

18:14.051 --> 18:16.053
"Beauty is fleeting, dear.
Before you know it,

18:16.053 --> 18:18.097
people will see you
for what you really are."

18:18.097 --> 18:19.890
Sounds like someone

18:19.890 --> 18:22.351
we should invite
in for a chat.
JONES: I agree.

18:22.351 --> 18:24.186
At the very least,
it will reduce the number

18:24.186 --> 18:26.689
of agitators outside by one.

18:26.689 --> 18:28.316
REPORTER: Any leads
at all, Inspector?

18:28.316 --> 18:29.525
REPORTER 2: Right, Chief
Inspector Jones. Over here.

18:29.525 --> 18:31.277
Over here.
Do you have a suspect?

18:31.277 --> 18:33.237
What do you have to say to
Lola's fans, Chief Inspector?

18:33.237 --> 18:34.822
How long are they going
to have to wait?

18:34.822 --> 18:36.532
You going to answer
questions today, mum?

18:36.532 --> 18:39.785
No, son. You are.

18:40.995 --> 18:42.496
Hey, hold on.

18:42.496 --> 18:43.914
What's this about?
REPORTER 3: Come on!

18:43.914 --> 18:45.374
REPORTER 4:
Where are you taking him?

18:45.374 --> 18:47.626
You've been in my e-mails?
HOLMES: You seem troubled

18:47.626 --> 18:50.087
that someone's invaded
your privacy.

18:50.087 --> 18:52.423
I get it. It's quite rich
since I'm a pap, right?

18:52.423 --> 18:54.425
Yeah, well, there's a difference
between a journalist

18:54.425 --> 18:56.344
observing people
in public spaces

18:56.344 --> 18:59.096
and the government sniffing
their nose in your DMs.

18:59.096 --> 19:01.390
Nobody hacked into
your accounts, genius.

19:01.390 --> 19:04.560
But we have been reading
Lola Quinn's correspondence.

19:04.560 --> 19:06.604
The victim, who you threatened.

19:06.604 --> 19:08.022
I didn't threaten her.

19:08.022 --> 19:08.856
WATSON: What would
you call it, then?

19:11.025 --> 19:12.568
Last month, she
wrote you a note.

19:12.568 --> 19:15.571
"I heard you have a picture
of me after the premiere.

19:15.571 --> 19:17.573
What will it take
to buy it exclusive?"

19:17.573 --> 19:19.367
And you responded,
"Bugger off.

19:19.367 --> 19:20.993
You can't afford it."

19:20.993 --> 19:24.872
Your correspondence
got more heated from there.

19:24.872 --> 19:27.833
At one point, you
promised to ruin Lola.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.502
Someone surely did that.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.087
It wasn't me.

19:31.087 --> 19:33.631
That's not terribly convincing,
Derek.

19:33.631 --> 19:35.174
Look, I'm...

19:35.174 --> 19:37.009
I wish I hadn't have said
those things.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.886
Well, sure.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.638
You wouldn't be
here if you hadn't.

19:40.638 --> 19:43.599
Look, y-you can believe I'm
sorry for what I wrote or not,

19:43.599 --> 19:46.352
but I was with my girlfriend
and her dad the day it happened.

19:46.352 --> 19:48.854
We watched Arsenal lose
in the pub.

19:48.854 --> 19:51.649
Uh, Kings Road in Islington.
Go check.

19:51.649 --> 19:54.777
We will, but that doesn't prove
that you weren't involved.

19:54.777 --> 19:56.862
You could have paid someone

19:56.862 --> 19:57.947
to make good on
your threats.

19:57.947 --> 19:59.281
They weren't real threats.

19:59.281 --> 20:01.617
It was just...
I wanted her to drop it.

20:01.617 --> 20:04.412
Right, there was no way that I
was gonna sell her those photos.

20:04.412 --> 20:06.122
What were the photos of?

20:06.122 --> 20:07.748
Lola, sloshed, slinking into
the back of a limo

20:07.748 --> 20:09.625
after some film premiere.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.919
Her skirt wasn't doing its job,

20:11.919 --> 20:13.838
if you take my meaning.
She was a mess.

20:13.838 --> 20:16.841
You wouldn't let her buy the
pictures to bury them. Why not?

20:16.841 --> 20:18.801
She couldn't
afford your price?
Oh, come off it.

20:18.801 --> 20:20.428
She's not a real celebrity.

20:20.428 --> 20:22.471
The reason why the picture
was worth so much

20:22.471 --> 20:23.806
was who she was with.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.476
Ruby Carville.

20:27.476 --> 20:29.728
I got her pulling Lola
into the backseat with her.

20:29.728 --> 20:31.230
The Ruby Carville?

20:31.230 --> 20:32.898
Owner of The Metro Flash?

20:32.898 --> 20:35.067
Yeah. And about half
the other rags I sell to.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.694
(chuckling):
It was too perfect.

20:36.694 --> 20:39.447
Tabloid media's ice queen
romping with a page-three hussy.

20:39.447 --> 20:41.407
I don't believe you.

20:41.407 --> 20:43.284
You don't have to.

20:43.284 --> 20:45.077
You can see for yourself
if you give me my camera.

20:49.081 --> 20:54.044
Yeah, Ms. Carville's who
I sold 'em to.

20:54.044 --> 20:56.505
She thought she bought
every copy, but I kept some.

20:56.505 --> 20:58.924
Just in case.

20:58.924 --> 21:00.301
Smartest thing I ever did, huh?

21:02.136 --> 21:03.846
You know, it's been
whispered for ages

21:03.846 --> 21:05.764
that she runs around
on her husband

21:05.764 --> 21:07.016
with pretty young things.

21:07.016 --> 21:09.226
Nobody ever got proof before.

21:09.226 --> 21:11.770
All this proves is that she let
Lola into her car.

21:11.770 --> 21:14.565
You ask me,
she's your next stop.

21:14.565 --> 21:17.193
There's a reason they call her
the witchiest woman in England.

21:17.193 --> 21:20.029
And who knows how she treats her
toys when she's done with them.

21:20.029 --> 21:21.822
JONES:
I'm gonna warn you right now.

21:21.822 --> 21:24.158
Don't get too excited about
Ruby Carville as a suspect.

21:24.158 --> 21:26.243
Oh, it's too late. The woman
is practically a Bond villain.

21:26.243 --> 21:27.411
She's more than capable.

21:27.411 --> 21:29.038
And if she didn't do it,

21:29.038 --> 21:30.623
she's got plenty of
enemies who might have.

21:30.623 --> 21:31.957
Maybe, but she's also
got more lawyers

21:31.957 --> 21:33.792
than the Yard has officers.

21:33.792 --> 21:36.754
If we're gonna take aim at the
bear, we can't afford to miss.

21:36.754 --> 21:38.047
We don't miss, generally.

21:38.047 --> 21:39.381
I could approach
her quietly.

21:39.381 --> 21:41.592
She might...
You're not hearing me.

21:41.592 --> 21:43.969
I want you to promise me
you won't go near her

21:43.969 --> 21:46.388
till we have more evidence
she was involved.

21:46.388 --> 21:48.432
Holmes.

21:48.432 --> 21:50.809
Watson and I will not
approach Ruby Carville

21:50.809 --> 21:52.061
without your say-so.

21:52.061 --> 21:54.146
You have my word.

22:01.487 --> 22:03.948
Ice cream?

22:03.948 --> 22:05.366
Seriously?
I'm the boy's godfather.

22:05.366 --> 22:06.951
I can treat him
every now and again.

22:06.951 --> 22:08.369
It's 10:00 in the morning.

22:08.369 --> 22:09.662
How did it go?

22:09.662 --> 22:11.163
I did everything
you asked.

22:11.163 --> 22:13.290
I told the receptionist
that I was a housekeeper

22:13.290 --> 22:15.543
at Buckingham Palace and this
was the queen's rubbish.

22:15.543 --> 22:18.003
And I said
I would only open it for Ruby.

22:18.003 --> 22:20.506
Took some doing, but they
brought me to her office.

22:20.506 --> 22:22.716
And then, when she tried
to negotiate a price,

22:22.716 --> 22:24.385
I asked her about Lola Quinn
and said

22:24.385 --> 22:25.761
I'd heard a few rumors
about the two of them.

22:25.761 --> 22:27.972
And?
She just...

22:27.972 --> 22:30.558
stared at me a moment, daggers.

22:30.558 --> 22:33.310
And then she told me to get out,
take my rubbish with me.

22:33.310 --> 22:34.937
Suspicious.

22:34.937 --> 22:36.689
But not incriminating.

22:39.775 --> 22:41.777
(laughs)

22:44.154 --> 22:45.948
In you go.

22:45.948 --> 22:47.741
Mind your little head.

22:47.741 --> 22:50.452
There we go.

22:52.997 --> 22:55.332
You talk to Watson lately?

22:55.332 --> 22:56.917
She's my partner.
We talk all the time.

22:56.917 --> 23:00.129
No. I mean... talk to her.

23:00.129 --> 23:02.715
I said to her yesterday
that I didn't think

23:02.715 --> 23:04.717
she'd taken to London very well.

23:04.717 --> 23:06.176
Have you not been paying
attention the last 12 months?

23:06.176 --> 23:07.678
She's been thriving.

23:07.678 --> 23:09.263
I'm not talking about work.

23:09.263 --> 23:11.223
I'm talking
about everything else.

23:11.223 --> 23:12.808
Don't tell me
you haven't noticed.

23:12.808 --> 23:14.059
Does she occasionally
miss New York?

23:14.059 --> 23:15.853
Yes, of course she does.

23:15.853 --> 23:17.813
That's to be expected
after a major relocation.

23:17.813 --> 23:19.857
I know from experience.
My move to New York--

23:19.857 --> 23:22.109
it was challenging,
but as time wore on,

23:22.109 --> 23:24.737
I grew to love my new home.

23:24.737 --> 23:27.406
It's not the same thing--
what you did, what she's done.

23:27.406 --> 23:28.699
You were running away
from something.

23:28.699 --> 23:30.659
She's run to something.

23:30.659 --> 23:33.579
Watson doesn't run
to anything, let alone me.

23:33.579 --> 23:36.832
She came here so that
we could be partners again.

23:36.832 --> 23:39.418
I'm just saying, it's different.

23:41.629 --> 23:43.422
(car door opens)

23:45.883 --> 23:48.260
Thanks again
for helping me today.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.512
I know you want her here.

23:50.512 --> 23:52.056
I want her here, too.

23:52.056 --> 23:55.142
Doesn't mean
that she belongs here.

23:55.142 --> 23:57.144
(engine starts)

24:02.191 --> 24:04.401
(knocking, door opens)

24:04.401 --> 24:06.403
Got a minute?

24:06.403 --> 24:08.155
Yeah, sure.

24:15.454 --> 24:18.165
What's up? You okay?

24:20.042 --> 24:21.669
There's something
I've been wanting

24:21.669 --> 24:23.796
to talk to you about
for a while now.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.339
Keep putting it off,
and now I only have

24:25.339 --> 24:29.385
a few days left here, and I...

24:29.385 --> 24:31.929
What? Go ahead.

24:34.431 --> 24:36.141
Everything that went down

24:36.141 --> 24:38.435
between you
and Sherlock and Joan--

24:38.435 --> 24:40.688
you gotta get past it.

24:40.688 --> 24:42.523
More than that.
You gotta fix it.

24:42.523 --> 24:43.899
Marcus...
No.

24:43.899 --> 24:45.818
They never did anything
but right by us.

24:45.818 --> 24:47.861
Now, whenever anyone
mentions them,

24:47.861 --> 24:50.155
it's like nails
on a chalkboard to you.

24:50.155 --> 24:51.824
I'm supposed to be happy
that Sherlock

24:51.824 --> 24:53.492
confessed to killing
Michael Rowan?

24:53.492 --> 24:55.369
That he threw away
everything he had here?

24:55.369 --> 24:57.121
He was trying
to save his partner.

24:57.121 --> 24:59.039
The Feds' case against Joan
was a joke.

24:59.039 --> 25:01.542
You know it, I know it,
but would he listen? No.

25:01.542 --> 25:03.460
He had to do
what he always does.

25:03.460 --> 25:04.795
He had to play cowboy.

25:04.795 --> 25:06.296
I know, okay?

25:08.048 --> 25:11.260
I know.

25:11.260 --> 25:13.095
You know?

25:14.847 --> 25:16.724
You know what?

25:16.724 --> 25:20.018
I know who really
killed Michael Rowan.

25:23.981 --> 25:26.233
I don't know what
you're talking about.

25:26.233 --> 25:28.861
I'm not stupid.

25:28.861 --> 25:30.696
I was with you
when we got the news

25:30.696 --> 25:32.698
Sherlock confessed
to Rowan's murder.

25:32.698 --> 25:35.951
You were angry,
but you weren't surprised.

25:38.287 --> 25:41.290
We're not having
this conversation.
I figured,

25:41.290 --> 25:44.293
okay, maybe I shouldn't
have been surprised, either.

25:44.293 --> 25:46.378
Sherlock was
doing right by Joan.

25:46.378 --> 25:48.172
I didn't like it, but I got it.

25:48.172 --> 25:50.132
I accepted it. You?

25:50.132 --> 25:52.342
You acted like
they never existed.

25:52.342 --> 25:54.344
Like they weren't
part of our family.

25:54.344 --> 25:56.472
Took me a while, but I
finally figured it out.

25:56.472 --> 25:58.766
It wasn't anger
you were feeling.

25:58.766 --> 26:00.559
It was guilt.

26:01.935 --> 26:03.812
You were protecting
someone, too.

26:08.484 --> 26:10.736
I don't like anything about what
happened with the Rowan case.

26:10.736 --> 26:13.197
Not one damn thing.

26:14.698 --> 26:16.742
I hate knowing what I know.

26:17.951 --> 26:19.995
But I get it.

26:19.995 --> 26:21.789
And to be clear,

26:21.789 --> 26:25.793
I don't think anyone else
needs to know about it.

26:25.793 --> 26:29.713
But Sherlock and Joan,
they were your friends.

26:29.713 --> 26:32.466
They were there for you,

26:32.466 --> 26:38.263
for me, always.

26:38.263 --> 26:40.974
It's time you made things
right with them.

26:48.649 --> 26:51.276
How?

26:51.276 --> 26:54.363
How the hell am I supposed
to do that?

26:56.573 --> 26:59.034
I don't know.

26:59.034 --> 27:01.537
But I bet "I'm sorry"
would be a good start.

27:13.841 --> 27:16.218
Oh, hey. I was gonna
go to the store.

27:16.218 --> 27:17.511
Do you need anything?

27:17.511 --> 27:20.514
I'm not hungry,
but thank you.

27:20.514 --> 27:21.723
You okay?

27:21.723 --> 27:23.392
(motorcycle approaching)

27:30.065 --> 27:33.026
MAN: Oi, you Holmes
and Watson?
What's it to you?

27:35.988 --> 27:37.698
This is for you.

27:39.575 --> 27:41.326
You're not gonna take it?

27:41.326 --> 27:42.995
You can leave it there.

27:42.995 --> 27:44.913
What, in the street?
Yeah.

27:47.499 --> 27:50.168
On your way.

28:13.150 --> 28:16.111
It's from Ruby Carville.
She wants to talk.

28:18.363 --> 28:20.449
(footsteps approaching)

28:20.449 --> 28:22.409
Forgive the mess.

28:22.409 --> 28:25.245
This place hasn't seen much
attention since my father died.

28:25.245 --> 28:27.456
He used to host
orgies here

28:27.456 --> 28:29.333
for his decrepit friends.

28:29.333 --> 28:33.128
Think Eyes Wide Shut,
but with more ear hair.

28:33.128 --> 28:35.923
That would explain
some of the smells.

28:35.923 --> 28:37.883
To what do we owe the
pleasure, Ms. Carville?

28:37.883 --> 28:42.679
A strange but intriguing woman
tried to sell me a bag

28:42.679 --> 28:44.723
of Her Majesty's rubbish
this morning.

28:44.723 --> 28:46.600
When it became clear
it was just a pretense

28:46.600 --> 28:49.519
to ask me questions of
a very private nature,

28:49.519 --> 28:51.355
I told her to leave.

28:51.355 --> 28:53.357
Then I put it to some
of my reporters

28:53.357 --> 28:54.691
at The Metro Flash
to identify her.

28:54.691 --> 28:57.194
It may be a rag,
but it's an investigative rag.

28:57.194 --> 28:59.655
Her name led to your names,
and here we are.

28:59.655 --> 29:01.073
You know we're helping
Scotland Yard investigate

29:01.073 --> 29:02.866
what happened to Lola Quinn.

29:02.866 --> 29:05.202
That's why I wanted to meet
away from prying eyes.

29:05.202 --> 29:06.995
Your little helper

29:06.995 --> 29:10.290
made reference to some rumors
about Lola and me.

29:10.290 --> 29:13.085
I assume they're the reason
I'm a suspect.

29:13.085 --> 29:14.419
Do you deny you were lovers?

29:17.297 --> 29:21.218
Actually,
I did love Lola very much,

29:21.218 --> 29:23.220
but not in the way you think.

29:25.055 --> 29:26.598
She wasn't my lover, you see.

29:26.598 --> 29:30.060
She... she was my daughter.

29:37.275 --> 29:38.860
I never told anyone about Lola.

29:38.860 --> 29:41.697
Not for 25 years.
You gave her up for adoption?

29:41.697 --> 29:43.865
It was my third year
at Oxford.

29:43.865 --> 29:47.369
I was persuaded a baby
would ruin my life.

29:47.369 --> 29:49.246
Not a day goes by

29:49.246 --> 29:50.998
I don't wonder.

29:53.417 --> 29:55.293
You don't believe me.

29:55.293 --> 29:57.379
No, that would be
a horrible thing to lie about.

29:57.379 --> 29:59.798
Not as horrible as what
you've come to accuse me of.

30:01.508 --> 30:03.135
Proof, then.

30:03.135 --> 30:05.095
Her birth certificate.

30:09.474 --> 30:12.644
You were 18 during
your third year at Oxford?

30:12.644 --> 30:14.271
I was precocious,

30:14.271 --> 30:16.356
but my father said
I was still a child,

30:16.356 --> 30:17.983
that I couldn't raise her.

30:17.983 --> 30:19.901
It was a harsh truth, but then,

30:19.901 --> 30:21.778
that's how he made
our family fortune.

30:21.778 --> 30:23.447
Harsh truth is our brand.

30:23.447 --> 30:25.574
Children out of wedlock aren't.

30:25.574 --> 30:26.533
No one ever knew?

30:28.493 --> 30:30.579
Dad arranged for me
to study abroad for a term.

30:30.579 --> 30:31.997
They took her
from the delivery room.

30:31.997 --> 30:33.248
I never even saw her.

30:33.248 --> 30:35.333
Until?
Four years ago.

30:35.333 --> 30:38.211
She sent me a letter,
perfectly polite.

30:38.211 --> 30:41.840
No hard feelings.
She didn't even want my money.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.217
She just wanted to know me.

30:44.217 --> 30:46.303
I wanted to help her--
that's why I kept

30:46.303 --> 30:47.512
our page-three spreads going,

30:47.512 --> 30:49.014
so I could put her
in my newspapers.

30:49.014 --> 30:50.432
As a glamour model?

30:50.432 --> 30:52.100
Teaching her the value
of a chaste image

30:52.100 --> 30:53.685
didn't really feel
like my place.

30:53.685 --> 30:55.312
Still, she was a secret
you went to

30:55.312 --> 30:56.897
extraordinary lengths to keep.

30:56.897 --> 30:59.107
And that hasn't changed.

30:59.107 --> 31:01.068
She would never have exposed us.
Even if she had,

31:01.068 --> 31:02.694
I could never hurt my daughter.

31:02.694 --> 31:04.613
WATSON: You made a lot
of enemies lover the years.

31:04.613 --> 31:07.115
Can you think of anyone
who would want to harm Lola

31:07.115 --> 31:08.784
to get back at you?

31:08.784 --> 31:11.244
Nobody knew she existed.
Of that I'm quite certain.

31:11.244 --> 31:12.621
This isn't about
my relationships.

31:12.621 --> 31:14.289
It could be about hers.

31:14.289 --> 31:15.540
Bad boyfriend?

31:15.540 --> 31:18.794
She had terrible taste in men.

31:18.794 --> 31:20.212
Every single one
she took up with,

31:20.212 --> 31:21.755
they were uniformly awful.

31:21.755 --> 31:23.423
Violent?

31:23.423 --> 31:24.966
Mostly just dull.

31:24.966 --> 31:26.843
But there was one...

31:26.843 --> 31:29.971
Farid Khan.
He owns a few nightclubs.

31:29.971 --> 31:32.557
Lola was very taken with him

31:32.557 --> 31:35.102
until earlier this year,
when he started hitting her.

31:40.315 --> 31:41.900
There's the faint outline
of a bruise

31:41.900 --> 31:43.110
beneath her sunglasses.

31:44.736 --> 31:45.904
"With my guy at the movies."

31:45.904 --> 31:47.155
Check his feed

31:47.155 --> 31:48.115
or any of the gossip magazines.

31:48.115 --> 31:49.616
They were an item at the time.

31:49.616 --> 31:51.868
We'll look into him.
Good.

31:51.868 --> 31:54.079
If you come to believe
he did this

31:54.079 --> 31:55.747
but you can't quite prove it,
let me know.

31:57.415 --> 31:59.167
I've never had anyone
killed before,

31:59.167 --> 32:00.710
but I don't think I'm above it.

32:03.338 --> 32:05.549
So, Ruby Carville
was right.

32:05.549 --> 32:08.385
Farid Khan is a
loathsome human being.

32:08.385 --> 32:10.512
But he didn't have anything
to do with the attack.

32:10.512 --> 32:12.556
Alibi?

32:12.556 --> 32:14.599
Well, amongst other
disqualifying factors,

32:14.599 --> 32:16.726
he was at a meeting
at the time of the attack.

32:16.726 --> 32:18.770
He was signing a deal
to invest in a line

32:18.770 --> 32:20.730
of licorice-flavored vape juice.

32:20.730 --> 32:22.983
I think I am onto something.

32:22.983 --> 32:26.361
These are all from
Lola's social media?
Yeah.

32:26.361 --> 32:28.238
Watching Ruby scroll past
so many posts

32:28.238 --> 32:30.532
to find the one
that she showed us,

32:30.532 --> 32:33.118
it struck me how active
Lola was on this site.

32:33.118 --> 32:35.871
She posted at least
five times a day, every day.

32:35.871 --> 32:37.747
She was a model.

32:37.747 --> 32:40.876
Self-promotion is second
only to carbohydrate avoidance.

32:40.876 --> 32:42.419
It seemed like an opportunity.

32:42.419 --> 32:43.795
I thought we'd find
another suspect or two

32:43.795 --> 32:45.338
somewhere in her feed.

32:45.338 --> 32:46.923
Yet she doesn't seem
to have shared the lens

32:46.923 --> 32:48.967
with anyone else.

32:48.967 --> 32:51.595
Anything in the comments?

32:51.595 --> 32:53.805
Just a lot of thirsty guys
and eggplant emojis.

32:53.805 --> 32:56.308
But if you look long enough,
you'll catch something.

32:56.308 --> 33:01.188
She's been airing reruns
for her followers.

33:01.188 --> 33:02.939
HOLMES:
That most recent photo

33:02.939 --> 33:04.691
was posted in April.

33:04.691 --> 33:06.151
WATSON:
Yeah.

33:06.151 --> 33:07.861
That's not the only one.

33:07.861 --> 33:10.697
She hasn't posted a new photo
since two Fridays ago.

33:10.697 --> 33:12.240
I think that's when it started.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.451
So, for some reason,

33:14.451 --> 33:17.829
she didn't feel camera-ready
these last two weeks.

33:17.829 --> 33:19.623
I'd like to know why.

33:25.670 --> 33:27.255
You should know,

33:27.255 --> 33:29.466
I'm gonna have a conversation
with DCI Jones.

33:29.466 --> 33:32.135
The "Doc" business, it's...
it's got to stop.

33:32.135 --> 33:33.511
She can dislike Americans
on her own time.

33:33.511 --> 33:36.723
Our relationship
needs to be more professional.

33:36.723 --> 33:39.226
Thanks.
And the business

33:39.226 --> 33:42.938
with the water heater in 221A,
that's being addressed today.

33:42.938 --> 33:45.649
So your showers
will no longer be an adventure.

33:47.484 --> 33:49.402
Why you being so nice to me?

33:49.402 --> 33:51.780
Aren't I always nice to you?

33:53.073 --> 33:54.991
Did Kitty talk to you about me?

33:57.285 --> 33:59.955
We may have had a conversation
about you

33:59.955 --> 34:02.082
and concerns she has
about your well-being.

34:04.501 --> 34:06.670
So, is she right?

34:06.670 --> 34:09.130
Are you having second thoughts
about being here in London?

34:09.130 --> 34:12.050
It's not just about DCI Jones.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.802
What is it?
Well, you know,

34:13.802 --> 34:15.220
it's a lot of things.

34:15.220 --> 34:17.055
My family's in New York,
all my friends.

34:17.055 --> 34:19.015
You know what I mean.
Uh-huh.

34:21.351 --> 34:23.353
You know I can never go back
to New York.

34:23.353 --> 34:25.146
I'll be arrested
for the murder

34:25.146 --> 34:27.148
of Michael Rowan--
a murder that you might remember

34:27.148 --> 34:29.359
I did not commit.

34:29.359 --> 34:31.194
Well, no one asked you
to confess.

34:31.194 --> 34:32.529
Well, you didn't really give me
any choice.

34:32.529 --> 34:33.989
Excuse me?

34:33.989 --> 34:35.407
The FBI only had eyes for you,

34:35.407 --> 34:36.783
and you forbade me
from going to them

34:36.783 --> 34:38.702
and telling them that the killer
was Hannah Gregson.

34:38.702 --> 34:41.579
I mean, y-you were going to
end up in a federal prison.

34:41.579 --> 34:43.248
If you don't like
the nickname "Doc,"

34:43.248 --> 34:45.208
imagine the names
they would devise for you there.

34:45.208 --> 34:48.086
Wow. So is this
why you confessed?

34:48.086 --> 34:50.463
So you could hold it over
my head for the rest of my life?

34:50.463 --> 34:51.673
Of course not.

34:51.673 --> 34:52.757
Then what the hell is this?

34:52.757 --> 34:54.551
Uh...

34:54.551 --> 34:56.303
I just, I-I'm disappointed.

34:57.971 --> 35:00.849
You know,
L-London is... is my home.

35:00.849 --> 35:03.184
It-it means something to me.

35:03.184 --> 35:06.271
It's not just that I can't
go back to New York.

35:06.271 --> 35:08.273
It's that I'm happy here.

35:08.273 --> 35:10.859
You know,
it-it's where I want to be.

35:10.859 --> 35:14.237
Yeah, well,
that makes one of us.

35:17.282 --> 35:19.534
GREGSON:
Things that bad
between us?

35:19.534 --> 35:21.911
You're emptying out your
desk a few days early?

35:21.911 --> 35:24.289
Been at the 11th a long time.

35:24.289 --> 35:25.957
It's gonna take a few trips.

35:25.957 --> 35:28.126
This is just the first.
(elevator bell chimes)

35:34.507 --> 35:36.801
I'm gonna call them tomorrow.

35:36.801 --> 35:39.596
Apologize.

35:39.596 --> 35:42.474
See how it goes.

35:42.474 --> 35:45.352
That's good.

35:45.352 --> 35:47.604
Ever since this thing
with Rowan...

35:47.604 --> 35:51.149
We don't have to
talk about it, ever.

35:53.193 --> 35:55.737
Thank you.

35:55.737 --> 35:59.949
For what you said yesterday.

35:59.949 --> 36:03.495
I needed that.

36:03.495 --> 36:05.872
You know, it's funny,
I thought I knew exactly

36:05.872 --> 36:10.210
how much I was gonna miss you
when you were gone.

36:10.210 --> 36:11.878
I was wrong.
(elevator bell chimes)

36:11.878 --> 36:13.421
(doors open)

36:19.719 --> 36:22.305
(whirring)

36:24.599 --> 36:25.975
Virgin?

36:25.975 --> 36:28.353
Excuse me?

36:28.353 --> 36:30.939
He means the drink, Watson.
This is Chip.

36:30.939 --> 36:34.943
He's a bartender at
the Saticoy Hotel.

36:34.943 --> 36:36.736
I think a little
too much ginger.

36:36.736 --> 36:37.821
You think?

36:37.821 --> 36:39.322
Anyway, thanks for coming.

36:39.322 --> 36:41.074
And for the libations.

36:44.661 --> 36:46.663
Cheers, love.

36:48.039 --> 36:50.083
Is that why you invited me over?

36:50.083 --> 36:51.626
Libations?
(door closes)

36:51.626 --> 36:53.753
Chip is more than
a simple mixologist.

36:53.753 --> 36:55.839
He's also a witness
in our investigation.

36:55.839 --> 36:57.799
You were very
nearly correct

36:57.799 --> 37:01.428
when you said that all
of Lola's recent posts were old.

37:01.428 --> 37:03.054
There was one
exception.

37:03.054 --> 37:05.890
That's from a week ago.

37:05.890 --> 37:07.267
Whatever she was hiding
from her viewing public,

37:07.267 --> 37:08.309
it wasn't from
the waist down.

37:08.309 --> 37:10.478
When I
recognized that

37:10.478 --> 37:12.272
as the rooftop pool
at the Saticoy,

37:12.272 --> 37:13.565
I contacted the bar there.

37:13.565 --> 37:15.150
They connected me with Chip.

37:15.150 --> 37:17.026
He made her that
drink, you see.

37:17.026 --> 37:20.238
Right slap-bang in the middle of
her self-imposed media blackout.

37:20.238 --> 37:22.866
When I asked him about her,
he said that she had bandages

37:22.866 --> 37:24.492
on her face.

37:24.492 --> 37:27.078
Across her nose
and beneath her eyes.

37:27.078 --> 37:29.247
Very tidy bandages.

37:29.247 --> 37:31.791
She had plastic surgery.

37:31.791 --> 37:33.376
She shouldn't have.

37:33.376 --> 37:35.462
It's the reason she was killed.

37:49.058 --> 37:52.061
I was told this was just
an informational interview.

37:53.396 --> 37:56.065
Should I have
my solicitor here?

37:56.065 --> 37:57.192
JONES:
It's not necessary,
Dr. Halsey.

37:57.192 --> 37:59.402
This is an
informational interview.

37:59.402 --> 38:01.279
We are going
to lay out

38:01.279 --> 38:03.031
the case we have against you.

38:03.031 --> 38:04.824
You don't have to say a word
if you don't want to.

38:06.159 --> 38:07.494
I don't understand.

38:07.494 --> 38:09.078
What case?

38:09.078 --> 38:11.539
It was you who splashed
Lola Quinn with acid.

38:11.539 --> 38:13.416
We're certain of it.

38:13.416 --> 38:15.502
(scoffs)
Two weeks ago,

38:15.502 --> 38:17.921
on Friday the 11th,
Lola checked herself

38:17.921 --> 38:20.757
into the Dunsmuir
Outpatient Surgery Center.

38:20.757 --> 38:22.717
She was permitted to check in
under an assumed name

38:22.717 --> 38:24.511
for privacy, but of course,

38:24.511 --> 38:26.429
she used her National
Insurance number.

38:26.429 --> 38:29.182
Now, you are listed there

38:29.182 --> 38:31.059
as her surgeon.

38:31.059 --> 38:33.353
JONES: When we first met,
you failed to mention

38:33.353 --> 38:36.147
you'd recently performed
an elective procedure on her.

38:36.147 --> 38:38.399
I didn't see how
that was relevant.

38:38.399 --> 38:39.943
And I still don't.

38:39.943 --> 38:42.195
Oh, we can help you with that.

38:42.195 --> 38:44.948
Her intake form indicates she
was there for a blepharoplasty.

38:44.948 --> 38:47.784
She wanted to reduce
the bags under her eyes.

38:47.784 --> 38:49.077
Is that correct?

38:49.077 --> 38:51.246
I don't recall.

38:51.246 --> 38:54.791
"I don't recall" is a useful
phrase, but it's not true.

38:54.791 --> 38:57.126
You did not perform
a blepharoplasty on her.

38:57.126 --> 38:59.128
You did an entirely
different procedure.

38:59.128 --> 39:01.422
A rhinoplasty,
to reshape her nose.

39:01.422 --> 39:03.633
You performed the wrong surgery.

39:03.633 --> 39:05.134
HOLMES:
We think she
was beginning

39:05.134 --> 39:07.428
to suspect as much,
and might have mentioned

39:07.428 --> 39:09.681
her desire
to seek a second opinion.

39:09.681 --> 39:12.225
I'm sorry. Do you really think
something like that

39:12.225 --> 39:14.894
wouldn't have come to light
in all the time since?

39:14.894 --> 39:16.729
I mean, I get that
you're not doctors, but...

39:16.729 --> 39:18.147
Actually,
I used to be one.

39:18.147 --> 39:19.899
So I know that Lola

39:19.899 --> 39:21.526
would have come out
of anesthesia

39:21.526 --> 39:23.861
having no idea
what had been done to her.

39:23.861 --> 39:25.655
Both operations
would have left her

39:25.655 --> 39:27.448
with dull pain
in her face

39:27.448 --> 39:29.576
and stitches near
the bridge of her nose.

39:29.576 --> 39:31.369
There would be swelling,
bruises and bandages

39:31.369 --> 39:33.746
covering up what you had done.

39:33.746 --> 39:36.457
When you realized your mistake,
you considered your options.

39:36.457 --> 39:38.293
WATSON:
A malpractice suit
was a given.

39:38.293 --> 39:40.503
Your wallet and your reputation
would also take a hit.

39:41.921 --> 39:43.756
Look, this is all ridiculous.

39:43.756 --> 39:45.883
You don't...

39:45.883 --> 39:47.635
You don't have proof
of anything.

39:47.635 --> 39:49.596
That was the point
of the acid.

39:49.596 --> 39:50.888
You weren't angry at Lola,

39:50.888 --> 39:51.973
you weren't
ideologically motivated,

39:51.973 --> 39:54.100
and you didn't want to rob her.

39:54.100 --> 39:56.519
You wanted to destroy evidence
of your malpractice.

39:59.981 --> 40:03.568
I think we've strayed far enough
for an informational interview.

40:03.568 --> 40:05.820
This is
pure fiction.

40:05.820 --> 40:07.947
You share any of it
with the press, and I will sue.

40:07.947 --> 40:10.908
You shouldn't have
pointed at the DCI.

40:10.908 --> 40:12.744
Oh, what, now you're
the manners police, are you?

40:12.744 --> 40:14.996
I'm not accusing you
of being rude.

40:14.996 --> 40:17.290
We just got a very good look
at the chemical burn

40:17.290 --> 40:19.834
on your finger.

40:19.834 --> 40:21.586
You spilled some
of the acid on yourself.

40:21.586 --> 40:25.715
The fingerprint
we pulled off Lola's bag.

40:25.715 --> 40:27.300
We thought we just
had a partial.

40:27.300 --> 40:30.928
Turns out...
we had the whole thing.

40:39.354 --> 40:40.605
(knocking on door)

40:40.605 --> 40:41.981
Uh, come in.

40:41.981 --> 40:43.608
(door opens and closes)

40:43.608 --> 40:45.485
You wanted to see me?

40:45.485 --> 40:47.278
Those are for you.

40:48.529 --> 40:50.698
You got me flowers?

40:50.698 --> 40:52.075
No, not me.

40:52.075 --> 40:53.743
Chip.

40:53.743 --> 40:55.203
The bartender.

40:55.203 --> 40:57.246
Fancies you.

40:57.246 --> 40:59.415
Said he went to your place
earlier, but you weren't in.

40:59.415 --> 41:02.293
Thanks.

41:02.293 --> 41:04.379
I never expected you
to come to London.

41:05.672 --> 41:07.382
When I confessed
to killing Michael,

41:07.382 --> 41:09.300
I knew what I was doing.

41:09.300 --> 41:12.303
I knew what I was sacrificing,
and...

41:12.303 --> 41:15.264
I was ready to go it alone.

41:15.264 --> 41:17.433
Now...

41:21.437 --> 41:24.857
I didn't say I was leaving.
I said I was struggling.

41:24.857 --> 41:27.110
I just need a little time, okay?

41:27.110 --> 41:28.861
(phone ringing)

41:30.613 --> 41:32.198
WATSON:
What?

41:33.741 --> 41:34.701
What?

41:37.286 --> 41:39.205
Are you gonna answer it?

41:43.126 --> 41:45.378
Captain.

41:45.378 --> 41:48.172
BELL:
Actually, it's me, Marcus.

41:48.172 --> 41:50.091
Sorry I'm calling like this.
I'm just dialing

41:50.091 --> 41:52.301
everyone he's close to
that's in his phone.

41:52.301 --> 41:53.928
I didn't have all the numbers.

41:55.263 --> 41:57.306
The captain,

41:57.306 --> 41:59.976
he's been shot.

41:59.976 --> 42:02.812
It's bad.
How bad?

42:02.812 --> 42:06.190
They found him last night
on a street out in Flushing.

42:06.190 --> 42:08.651
Nobody saw
what happened.

42:08.651 --> 42:10.945
The doctors, they, uh...

42:10.945 --> 42:14.073
they're not sure
he's gonna pull through.

42:14.073 --> 42:15.700
Thought you guys should know.
