WEBVTT

00:08.209 --> 00:10.275
Come on, reggie!

00:10.277 --> 00:12.211
We are building
a rocket engine,

00:12.213 --> 00:14.380
And you put the gimbal block in
upside down.

00:14.382 --> 00:16.815
Don't you know anything
about gimbal blocks?

00:16.817 --> 00:18.650
No, i don't.

00:18.652 --> 00:20.486
And i'm sick of
doing science.

00:20.488 --> 00:21.787
I want to stop.

00:21.789 --> 00:25.524
Stop? When i'm this close to
perfecting the invention

00:25.526 --> 00:29.395
That will forever change the way
man lives on this planet?

00:29.397 --> 00:31.964
( sighs )
hate to break it to you,
dr. P,

00:31.966 --> 00:34.700
But someone's already
invented the shoe.

00:34.702 --> 00:37.302
This is not just a shoe.

00:37.304 --> 00:39.271
This is a rocket shoe.

00:39.273 --> 00:41.840
Lace these babies up, and they
can take you to the moon.

00:41.842 --> 00:43.342
I don't know how you're
gonna get back,

00:43.344 --> 00:45.210
But i'm working on
a sock for that.

00:46.947 --> 00:48.914
I'm all scienced out.

00:48.916 --> 00:51.233
Can't we just
do something regular,

00:51.234 --> 00:53.551
Like dig a hole
or drop some sticks
down the sewer?

00:53.554 --> 00:56.321
Look, when we're at your house,
we do what you want.

00:56.323 --> 00:58.557
So when we're at my house,
we do what i want.

00:58.559 --> 00:59.691
But we're never
at my house.

00:59.693 --> 01:01.860
Because we'd have to do
what you want!

01:01.862 --> 01:05.297
I have a pool
and a trampoline.

01:05.299 --> 01:06.265
What's wrong with you?

01:06.267 --> 01:08.300
Those are toys for kids!

01:08.302 --> 01:10.019
We are scientists!

01:10.020 --> 01:11.737
Scientists were kids before
they were scientists.

01:13.474 --> 01:15.407
Hey!

01:15.409 --> 01:16.775
Do either of you guys
want to play basketball?

01:16.777 --> 01:18.343
-No!
-Yes!

01:18.345 --> 01:20.345
Yes!

01:20.347 --> 01:21.447
With willow spending
all of her time

01:21.449 --> 01:23.382
Rehearsing with liv
and the band,

01:23.384 --> 01:24.550
And diggie, you know...

01:24.552 --> 01:26.819
Being a heartbreaking
jerk-face,

01:26.821 --> 01:29.488
I really haven't had anyone
to shoot hoops with.

01:29.490 --> 01:32.825
Reggie's as good a victim as
anyone.

01:32.827 --> 01:34.793
What? We've already
been through this.

01:34.795 --> 01:35.828
When we're at my house--

01:35.830 --> 01:37.463
But when we're
at maddie's house,

01:37.465 --> 01:39.364
We do what maddie wants.

01:39.366 --> 01:43.302
Seriously? You're choosing
my sister over me?

01:43.304 --> 01:45.370
It's not you, dr. P,
it's me.

01:45.372 --> 01:46.705
And me is sick of you.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.043

02:48.903 --> 02:50.569
Why are we bouncing?

02:50.571 --> 02:53.038
I'm just so excited
to tell you

02:53.040 --> 02:55.340
About my date with
holden last night.

02:55.342 --> 02:56.642
Date recap!

02:56.644 --> 02:57.776
Spill.

02:57.778 --> 03:00.712
Look at me, talking to
my good friend

03:00.714 --> 03:03.615
About the date she went on
with the guy i like.

03:03.617 --> 03:06.051
All kinds of mature.

03:06.053 --> 03:07.720
(sighs)

03:07.721 --> 03:09.388
You know, if i'm ever
gonna win an oscar,

03:09.390 --> 03:11.990
It's going to be for
best supporting friend.

03:11.992 --> 03:14.593
Holden picked me up,
and we drove to
the observatory.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.828
When we got there,
he surprised me
with a picnic!

03:16.830 --> 03:18.130
No!

03:18.132 --> 03:19.898
Oh! This is so romantic.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.401
Yeah, you'd think,
but once you finish
the potato salad,

03:22.403 --> 03:24.970
There's, like, nothing
really to do.

03:24.972 --> 03:29.641
So, i took him down
to the track where
my brother was racing!

03:32.112 --> 03:34.479
Okay, wait, but...

03:34.481 --> 03:37.916
Why would you leave a beautiful
picnic at the observatory

03:37.918 --> 03:40.085
To watch cars
drive in the mud?

03:41.956 --> 03:44.423
Holden asked me
the same question,

03:44.425 --> 03:45.891
Like, several times.

03:47.161 --> 03:48.827
But we weren't
just watching.

03:48.829 --> 03:51.463
-(giddy laugh)
-we were down in the pit

03:51.465 --> 03:54.399
Right next to the roar
of engines.

03:56.770 --> 03:59.538
(shouting)
hey, guys! What's up?

03:59.540 --> 04:00.672
Um...

04:00.674 --> 04:02.207
Holden, you're kinda yelling.

04:02.209 --> 04:04.576
What? I'm sorry,
i can't hear you!

04:04.578 --> 04:06.845
My hearing's shot
from last night.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.914
That happens the first couple
times you go to the track.

04:09.950 --> 04:13.752
Are you talking right now?
I can't really tell!

04:13.754 --> 04:15.904
There's willow.

04:15.905 --> 04:18.055
Gotta go tell her about
our magical evening!

04:19.093 --> 04:21.560
Did she say "magical"
or "tragical?"

04:21.562 --> 04:23.729
Because it was
extremely tragical.

04:23.731 --> 04:27.165
Um, andie told me
she had a really great
time with you last night.

04:27.167 --> 04:28.567
(regular voice)
i know.

04:28.569 --> 04:29.801
I'm beginning
to think

04:29.803 --> 04:32.738
We don't really have
that much in common...

04:32.740 --> 04:34.206
You know, other than you.

04:34.208 --> 04:36.675
(laughs nervously)

04:36.677 --> 04:38.577
Yes, that's me.

04:38.579 --> 04:39.878
The common denominator.

04:39.880 --> 04:42.714
Just...Friend to all.

04:42.716 --> 04:43.949
Guys!

04:43.951 --> 04:45.450
Our band just
booked a gig!

04:45.452 --> 04:47.586
The dream is gonna
be on tv!

04:47.588 --> 04:50.756
Oh! This is so awesome!
What show?

04:50.758 --> 04:52.224
<i>Nimbus at night.</i>

04:52.226 --> 04:55.027
Oh! This is so awesome!

04:57.531 --> 04:59.231
What is that?

04:59.232 --> 05:00.932
Oh, it's johnny nimbus'
new late night talk show.

05:00.934 --> 05:02.801
There's a live
studio audience,

05:02.803 --> 05:04.636
And everyone in town's
gonna be watching

05:04.638 --> 05:06.204
Because it airs right before
the crop report.

05:06.206 --> 05:09.641
(gasps)
this is so cool!

05:09.643 --> 05:11.576
That's awesome!

05:11.578 --> 05:13.745
(shouting) i have no idea
what willow said,

05:13.747 --> 05:15.514
But you guys look
really happy.

05:23.624 --> 05:24.956
Stupid curtain!

05:24.958 --> 05:27.042
I'm in no mood, people.

05:27.043 --> 05:29.127
Let's just get on with it
and run through the parrot bit.

05:29.129 --> 05:31.063
(bell rings)

05:31.065 --> 05:33.732
Unique new york.
Unique new york.
Unique new york.

05:33.734 --> 05:36.635
Hello, stevens point!

05:36.637 --> 05:38.603
It's your old pal
johnny nimbus,

05:38.605 --> 05:41.773
And i am happy to say it's time
for "parrot pet peeves."

05:41.775 --> 05:44.609
That's where i debate
the hot-button issues
of the day

05:44.611 --> 05:47.679
With everybody's
favorite parrot,
joanne squawkers.

05:47.681 --> 05:48.880
Hey, joanne.

05:48.882 --> 05:51.083
What are we squawking
about, johnny?

05:51.085 --> 05:53.819
Well, today's topic is...
Animals!

05:53.821 --> 05:55.587
Should they be
allowed to vote?

05:55.589 --> 05:57.673
I say yes!

05:57.674 --> 05:59.758
(squawks)
and they say
i'm the birdbrain.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.193
Oh. Ha ha.

06:01.195 --> 06:02.661
-You know what?
-What?

06:02.663 --> 06:04.696
I can't do this.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.665
I have a degree
from harvard.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.633
Harvard!

06:08.635 --> 06:10.535
(bell rings)

06:10.537 --> 06:11.670
Well, this is bad!

06:11.672 --> 06:13.271
Where are we going to
find a lady

06:13.273 --> 06:15.807
With a squeaky enough
voice to be the parrot?

06:15.809 --> 06:18.944
Excuse me. Excuse me,
man who lifts things.

06:18.946 --> 06:20.846
Do you know where
the men's room is?

06:22.649 --> 06:25.650
<i>I am interning at</i>
<i>nimbus at night</i>

06:25.652 --> 06:28.854
So i look more well-rounded
on my college application.

06:28.856 --> 06:32.991
Right now, all i can list
is a failed attempt
at jv badminton

06:32.993 --> 06:36.061
And an enviable collection
of kitty-cat t-shirts.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.229
Meow.

06:37.231 --> 06:39.264
Joey rooney!

06:39.266 --> 06:41.133
Your squeaky,
half-girl voice

06:41.135 --> 06:43.735
Just earned you
a promotion, young man.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.304
How would you like to be
the voice of joanne squawkers?

06:46.306 --> 06:49.808
Now, there's no money,
no health insurance,
no recognition--

06:49.810 --> 06:53.311
Mr. Nimbus, you can stop
the hard sell

06:53.313 --> 06:58.250
Because i am in!

06:58.252 --> 07:01.386
I am the voice
of a lady parrot.

07:01.388 --> 07:05.757
My college app is looking
better and better!

07:05.759 --> 07:08.593
So, joanne, how do you think
a rhinoceros would vote?

07:08.595 --> 07:11.196
I have no idea, johnny,

07:11.198 --> 07:14.766
But i know how
he pays for dinner.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.101
He charges.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.636
(laughs)

07:17.638 --> 07:18.770
Ha ha!

07:18.772 --> 07:19.972
I like that.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.173
You don't have to
tell me, johnny.

07:21.175 --> 07:22.274
I know it's great.

07:27.881 --> 07:29.881
Come on.
Come at me.

07:31.618 --> 07:32.818
Oh, yes!

07:32.820 --> 07:34.219
What's that thing you say?

07:34.221 --> 07:35.887
All right!
Bam what?

07:35.889 --> 07:37.756
Ha ha.

07:37.758 --> 07:39.791
(sighs)
you're really cute, but...

07:39.793 --> 07:41.059
Don't push it.

07:45.365 --> 07:46.765
Oh!

07:46.767 --> 07:48.800
Just apologize
to reggie.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.302
Absolutely not, mother.

07:50.304 --> 07:51.903
I still have my pride.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.638
(chuckles)
well, fine.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.207
While you're standing
at the sink,

07:55.209 --> 07:57.676
You and your pride
can wash some dishes.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.244
You know,
pride is overrated.

07:59.246 --> 08:01.746
I'll just go apologize.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.350
Hi, reggie.

08:05.352 --> 08:07.352
Oh.
Hey there...

08:07.354 --> 08:08.920
Maddie's little brother.

08:08.922 --> 08:12.958
Okay, that stung,
but i had it coming.

08:12.960 --> 08:16.728
Reggie, i'm sorry.

08:16.730 --> 08:19.097
Whoo! Weight lifted,
bridges mended,

08:19.099 --> 08:21.166
And we're friends again!

08:21.168 --> 08:24.135
Now let's build us
some rocket shoes!

08:24.137 --> 08:28.840
Wow. Way to totally phone in
that apology, little bro.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.276
It doesn't matter.
It was sent direct
to voicemail.

08:31.278 --> 08:33.845
Ooh!

08:33.847 --> 08:35.413
Hey, want to play
another game?

08:35.415 --> 08:38.116
Oh! Someone who cares
what i want.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.384
How refreshing.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.090
Oh!

08:45.092 --> 08:46.791
He's mine now.

08:51.899 --> 08:54.733
(piano melody)

09:03.443 --> 09:06.411
<i>♪ if i could do it</i>
<i>all over ♪</i>

09:06.413 --> 09:09.180
<i>♪ maybe i'd do it different ♪</i>

09:09.182 --> 09:10.482
-(crash)
-oh!

09:12.986 --> 09:14.986
(laughs nervously)

09:14.988 --> 09:16.855
Hey.

09:16.857 --> 09:19.424
Hmm.
Uh, what are you doing?

09:19.426 --> 09:21.159
Well, i was working
on something

09:21.160 --> 09:22.893
That i thought that we could
play on <i> nimbus at night.</i>

09:22.896 --> 09:25.046
Hmm.

09:25.047 --> 09:27.197
I couldn't get that song that
you sang at prom out of my head.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.000
Oh.
(chuckles)

09:29.002 --> 09:30.802
He means "true love."

09:30.804 --> 09:32.470
Right. The song that
reminds me

09:32.472 --> 09:35.774
That my good friend is
dating the guy that i like.

09:35.776 --> 09:39.377
Yeah, i can't really seem to
get that out of my head either.

09:39.379 --> 09:41.746
I was playing around with
the melody a little bit.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.181
So just let me know
what you think.

09:43.183 --> 09:44.215
Okay.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.351
(piano melody)

09:55.829 --> 09:58.930

10:59.860 --> 11:01.192
What's going on
in here?

11:01.194 --> 11:03.328
-Um...
-Yeah, what's going on in here?

11:04.197 --> 11:07.999
That duet
sounds amazing!

11:08.001 --> 11:09.934
We have to do it
on <i> nimbus at night.</i>

11:09.936 --> 11:12.937
Yeah, i'm not sure we want
to go down that road.

11:12.939 --> 11:14.506
No, it's killer.

11:14.508 --> 11:16.074
Let's work on
an arrangement.

11:16.076 --> 11:17.108
Tell you what,

11:17.110 --> 11:18.910
You and holden
work out the song

11:18.912 --> 11:21.196
As a couple.

11:21.197 --> 11:23.481
Liv and i will just work
on some vocal exercises.

11:23.483 --> 11:25.283
Okay, try this.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.485
(scale) ♪ no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no ♪

11:27.487 --> 11:29.454
No!

11:38.031 --> 11:40.498
Maddie, you have to
fix this.

11:40.500 --> 11:41.966
I just caught liv
and holden

11:41.968 --> 11:43.868
Singing to each other
all lovey-dovey.

11:43.870 --> 11:46.871
I swear there were cartoon
hearts and unicorns
circling their heads!

11:50.343 --> 11:53.378
Liv, is that true?

11:53.380 --> 11:55.013
I don't know.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.114
(scoffs)

11:57.217 --> 12:01.152
Maybe there was, like,
one unicorn.

12:01.154 --> 12:04.522
There were multiple
unicorns.

12:04.524 --> 12:07.926
Okay.

12:07.928 --> 12:08.960
Fine.

12:08.962 --> 12:10.995
Holden and i had...

12:10.997 --> 12:12.397
A romantic moment,

12:12.399 --> 12:15.266
And it was really intense.

12:16.503 --> 12:19.204
(sighs)
i don't know, guys.

12:19.206 --> 12:22.540
I really thought that
i had swept this crush

12:22.542 --> 12:24.008
That i have on holden
under a rug.

12:24.010 --> 12:27.145
But now there's just this
big, dusty, like...

12:27.147 --> 12:29.981
Rug bump of feelings.

12:29.983 --> 12:32.117
Then you take that rug out

12:32.119 --> 12:34.052
And you beat it
with a stick!

12:36.690 --> 12:40.125
Okay. So i think
we all just need to
calm down a little bit.

12:40.127 --> 12:43.328
Mostly willow
should calm down.

12:43.330 --> 12:47.432
I just have to shut those
feelings down for good,
that's all.

12:47.434 --> 12:51.035
It's open season
on unicorns.

12:52.205 --> 12:55.340
Okay, you, like, seriously
need to dial it down.

12:55.342 --> 12:57.275
I know.

13:00.580 --> 13:03.014
(cheers and applause)

13:03.016 --> 13:04.949
(laughing)
this is great.

13:04.951 --> 13:08.019
Okay, next topic.
Pie versus cake.

13:08.021 --> 13:09.053
Which one is better?

13:09.055 --> 13:10.655
I stand in the corner
of cake.

13:10.657 --> 13:12.724
Joanne, give me a slice
of your opinion.

13:12.726 --> 13:15.544
Squawk!

13:15.545 --> 13:18.363
Cake is the most overrated
of all the desserts.

13:18.365 --> 13:19.664
(audience groans)

13:19.666 --> 13:21.699
Anyone with half a brain

13:21.701 --> 13:24.035
Knows that pie
is better than cake.

13:24.037 --> 13:26.137
Squawk!

13:26.138 --> 13:28.238
Joanne squawkers,
if pie was better,

13:28.241 --> 13:30.041
You'd have it at birthday
parties.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.743
Have you ever heard of
a birthday pie?

13:31.745 --> 13:33.278
I don't think so!

13:33.280 --> 13:36.047
You just got nim-busted!

13:36.049 --> 13:37.549
(bell dings)

13:37.551 --> 13:39.017
(applause)

13:39.019 --> 13:40.418
Nimbus:
Now, we all know...

13:40.420 --> 13:41.986
Hey.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.988
Hi.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.191
I really think that we need
to talk abut what happened.

13:46.193 --> 13:47.559
Yeah, i've been
thinking about it.

13:47.561 --> 13:48.993
-Okay.
-Thinking about what?

13:48.995 --> 13:50.528
Uh, uh...

13:50.530 --> 13:52.197
Just thinking about...

13:52.199 --> 13:54.299
Blowing the roof
off this place!

13:54.301 --> 13:55.733
(imitates explosion)

13:55.735 --> 13:57.335
(liv laughs nervously)

13:57.337 --> 13:59.137
But, you know, it's just
gonna be so tough

13:59.139 --> 14:01.573
-Following
joanne squawkers.
-Yeah.

14:01.575 --> 14:03.408
Good talk, miss squawk.

14:03.410 --> 14:05.176
Hey, folks,
we'll be right back

14:05.178 --> 14:07.612
With local rock sensation
the dream!

14:07.614 --> 14:12.350
Right here on
<i>nimbus...At night.</i>

14:12.352 --> 14:13.751
(applause)

14:15.589 --> 14:17.055
Oh!

14:17.057 --> 14:19.324
I win again, reginald.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.628
How does that feel, huh?

14:23.630 --> 14:26.264
Does it burn?

14:26.266 --> 14:29.133
I think i see why nobody
wants to play with you.

14:29.135 --> 14:30.468
You rooneys are intense.

14:30.470 --> 14:31.636
(scoffs)

14:36.209 --> 14:38.042
What are you doing?

14:38.044 --> 14:40.311
Uhh...

14:40.313 --> 14:42.247
The dishes.

14:52.292 --> 14:55.093
(band playing, applause)

14:57.464 --> 14:59.230
Welcome back, stevens point!

14:59.232 --> 15:01.366
Boy, do i have
a treat for you.

15:01.368 --> 15:03.801
Joining me here tonight
is the winner

15:03.803 --> 15:06.070
Of this year's
battle of the bands,

15:06.072 --> 15:07.238
The dream!

15:07.240 --> 15:08.806
(cheers and applause)

15:08.808 --> 15:10.441
Hi!

15:10.443 --> 15:12.744
Gimme some!
All right!

15:12.746 --> 15:15.246
Hey!

15:15.248 --> 15:17.081
Welcome to the show, guys.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.250
Thank you.
Thank you so much
for having us.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.085
Now, liv rooney,

15:21.087 --> 15:23.238
You're kind of a big deal.

15:23.239 --> 15:25.390
Some would even say you're
the johnny nimbus of hollywood.

15:25.392 --> 15:28.226
(laughs)
aw.

15:28.228 --> 15:30.194
No one's ever
said that, johnny.

15:30.196 --> 15:33.131
Ha ha! Give it time, kid,
you'll get there.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.233
Now, my sources tell me

15:35.235 --> 15:38.703
There is a couple
in this band.

15:38.705 --> 15:39.737
(audience gasps)

15:39.739 --> 15:41.339
Liv, holden,

15:41.341 --> 15:42.807
How long have you been
deeply in love?

15:42.809 --> 15:45.276
(laughs)

15:45.278 --> 15:47.145
(laughs)

15:47.147 --> 15:48.746
-Actually...
-Actually...

15:48.748 --> 15:52.750
Johnny, holden and i
are the couple.

15:52.752 --> 15:55.586
And don't they make
a great one?

15:55.588 --> 15:56.888
They do!

15:56.890 --> 15:58.823
Come on,
stevens point,

15:58.824 --> 16:00.757
Put your hands together
for holden and andie.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.460
Handie!

16:03.430 --> 16:05.163
Hey!

16:05.165 --> 16:08.166
You know, old johnny cupid
should have said something
there,

16:08.168 --> 16:11.636
'cause i can tell andie
is one smitten kitten.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.137
Guilty.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.505
How about you, holden?

16:14.507 --> 16:16.841
Are you as smitten
as this kitten?

16:18.244 --> 16:19.877
Um...

16:19.879 --> 16:23.147
She's a great...Gal.

16:24.751 --> 16:26.784
Great gal?

16:26.786 --> 16:28.486
How about
"light of your life,"

16:28.488 --> 16:31.255
Or "apple of your eye,"
or "one and only"?

16:31.257 --> 16:33.224
Or stop me when you
hear one you like.

16:34.894 --> 16:37.495
I'm not sure i want to
talk about this on tv.

16:38.465 --> 16:41.799
It's okay, holden.
I don't mind.

16:43.303 --> 16:45.570
Um...

16:45.572 --> 16:47.605
Well, uh...

16:47.607 --> 16:49.640
Why are you being
so weird?

16:49.642 --> 16:51.175
Seriously.

16:51.177 --> 16:53.244
I haven't had a conversation
this awkward

16:53.246 --> 16:55.580
Since my first wife told me
she needed a break.

16:55.582 --> 16:57.715
(laughs nervously)

16:57.717 --> 17:00.318
Is that what's going on?

17:02.589 --> 17:04.822
Holden, are you...

17:04.824 --> 17:07.258
Are you breaking up
with me?

17:09.362 --> 17:11.963
Andie, i'm sorry.

17:11.965 --> 17:15.233
I didn't want to
tell you like this.

17:17.237 --> 17:19.504
Wow.

17:19.506 --> 17:21.606
Andie.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.574
I-i gotta go.

17:30.784 --> 17:32.350
Don't worry, mr. Nimbus.

17:32.352 --> 17:34.352
This may be my only chance
to be on tv.

17:34.354 --> 17:36.854
I'm not going anywhere.

17:41.928 --> 17:44.295
(band playing, applause)

17:45.632 --> 17:48.833
Ha! Oh, welcome back,
stevens point.

17:48.835 --> 17:50.301
Well, this was
the part of the show

17:50.303 --> 17:52.303
Where our musical guests,
the dream,

17:52.305 --> 17:53.337
Was supposed to perform.

17:53.339 --> 17:55.873
Squawk!
But they're all gone!

17:55.875 --> 18:00.411
This show's a disaster!

18:00.413 --> 18:02.380
Squawk!

18:02.382 --> 18:04.682
Joanne squawkers,
don't be so negative.

18:04.684 --> 18:05.917
We still got willow here.

18:05.919 --> 18:07.418
She'll sing for us,
won't you, willow?

18:07.420 --> 18:09.487
What? No, i can't
sing by myself.

18:10.723 --> 18:13.291
Well, fine. We'll have
joey sing with you.

18:13.293 --> 18:14.459
-Come up, joey.
-Joey?

18:14.461 --> 18:16.260
Joey. Joe--

18:16.262 --> 18:17.528
-Joey!
-What?

18:17.530 --> 18:18.563
I mean...

18:18.565 --> 18:20.264
<i>♪ no ♪</i>

18:20.266 --> 18:22.433

18:22.435 --> 18:24.602
I don't want to
freak you out,

18:24.603 --> 18:26.770
But i had this exact
scenario on my vision board.

18:28.308 --> 18:31.442
Everything's

18:57.437 --> 18:58.836
Oh, honey.

19:00.006 --> 19:02.473
I saw the show.
How's andie?

19:02.475 --> 19:04.842
Um...

19:04.844 --> 19:06.077
I was actually
just with her.

19:06.079 --> 19:07.812
You know,
she's pretty upset,

19:07.814 --> 19:09.680
But i think she's
gonna be okay.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.415
She went to the scrapyard

19:11.417 --> 19:13.918
And welded three minivans
into a monster truck.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.319
Well, that's good.

19:15.321 --> 19:17.889
The blowtorch does seem
to soothe her.

19:17.891 --> 19:19.757
-(doorbell rings)
-i got it.

19:25.999 --> 19:28.065
Holden.

19:28.067 --> 19:29.867
I need to talk to you.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.337
I'll give you guys
some privacy.

19:38.778 --> 19:41.445
What were you thinking?

19:41.447 --> 19:42.580
How could you do that
to andie?

19:42.582 --> 19:46.350
I never meant for it
to happen like that.

19:46.352 --> 19:47.852
I was gonna break it off
with her after the show,

19:47.854 --> 19:50.488
But when nimbus
put me on the spot...

19:50.490 --> 19:53.424
I couldn't lie.

19:53.426 --> 19:55.526
I have feelings
for someone else.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.061
-Holden--
-let me finish.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.404
When i first
moved back home,

20:06.406 --> 20:09.907
I felt something
between you and me.

20:09.909 --> 20:12.944
But i wasn't really sure
how you were feeling.

20:12.946 --> 20:15.479
And then andie
asked me to prom,

20:15.481 --> 20:17.648
And she's...

20:17.650 --> 20:18.983
Great.

20:21.487 --> 20:23.554
But the more time
i spent with her,

20:23.556 --> 20:26.424
The more i realized...

20:26.426 --> 20:28.025
She's not the one for me.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.966
Liv...

20:36.069 --> 20:37.802
I like you.

20:43.943 --> 20:46.043
Holden, i really
like you, too.

20:49.816 --> 20:52.817
And you're a really
great guy.

20:52.819 --> 20:54.051
But...

20:55.455 --> 20:57.088
But...

20:57.090 --> 21:00.625
But you know
i can't date you.

21:00.627 --> 21:02.059
I mean, andie's my friend,

21:02.061 --> 21:04.228
And she's hurting
a lot right now,

21:04.230 --> 21:07.598
And i'm not just gonna
hurt her more, you know?

21:09.035 --> 21:12.436
Friends don't do that
to each other.

21:14.474 --> 21:16.574
I'm sorry.

21:22.115 --> 21:23.614
I understand.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.616
Okay.

21:28.554 --> 21:30.488
Okay.

21:39.499 --> 21:40.631
(door closes)

21:42.001 --> 21:43.567
Now, i'm not
going to lie.

21:43.569 --> 21:46.837
I listened to that
entire conversation.

21:46.839 --> 21:49.874
I am so sorry, sweetie.

21:49.876 --> 21:51.642
Did i do the right thing?

21:51.644 --> 21:53.210
-You did.
-Okay.

21:53.212 --> 21:55.546
You're a good friend.

21:55.548 --> 21:57.715
Oh.

22:02.689 --> 22:04.121
It's 10 to 10.

22:04.123 --> 22:07.491
Next basket wins.

22:07.493 --> 22:08.893
Are you hearing me?

22:08.895 --> 22:11.495
(shouting)
are you hearing me?

22:12.565 --> 22:16.200
Whoa. And i thought
parker was crazy-pants.

22:16.202 --> 22:20.638
-Uh, reggie needs a timeout.
-You don't speak for me!

22:20.640 --> 22:22.006
I need a timeout.

22:24.711 --> 22:26.811
Still like playing
with my sister?

22:26.813 --> 22:28.946
Dude, all she does is
scream in my face.

22:28.948 --> 22:30.881
Well, i've got a way
for you to beat her.

22:30.883 --> 22:33.784
I'm all ears, dr. P.
I'll do science.
I'll do math.

22:33.786 --> 22:36.587
Just please, help me take
that crazy woman down.

22:41.027 --> 22:42.660
Behold.

22:42.662 --> 22:44.695
The rocket shoe.

22:44.697 --> 22:46.897
(dramatic music plays)

22:50.069 --> 22:51.535
You're not getting
past me, tiny.

22:51.537 --> 22:52.837
Come on.

22:52.839 --> 22:55.072
I don't have to,
'cause i'm going over you.

22:55.074 --> 22:56.173
(beep)

23:02.048 --> 23:04.048
(grunts)

23:05.284 --> 23:07.184
We did it, dr. P!
I win!

23:07.186 --> 23:09.754
Aagghh!

23:09.756 --> 23:12.656
Okay, but you cheated.

23:12.658 --> 23:14.825
There are no rocket shoes
in basketball.

23:14.827 --> 23:17.661
Too bad.
So sad.

23:17.663 --> 23:19.263
Let's go dig a hole, reggie.

23:19.265 --> 23:23.601
You make my heart cry,
dr. P.

23:23.603 --> 23:25.035
(beep)

23:31.677 --> 23:32.777
Joey:
Squawk!

23:33.946 --> 23:35.880
(boing)
