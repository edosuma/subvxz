WEBVTT

00:04.787 --> 00:06.354
- Morning.
- I don't know...

00:06.397 --> 00:07.659
- Hey!
- Hi, Dad.

00:07.703 --> 00:09.139
Sorry, Mom. I've got to go.

00:09.183 --> 00:10.377
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What'd I do?

00:10.401 --> 00:11.837
Nothing. You are perfect.

00:11.881 --> 00:15.145
- Bye, honey.
- Bye. See you this evening.

00:15.189 --> 00:16.668
- How are you feeling?
- Fantastic.

00:16.712 --> 00:19.367
They're giving me the steroids
in the infusion.

00:19.410 --> 00:22.065
So I feel like I could run
a marathon.

00:22.109 --> 00:23.632
Look what I found.

00:25.721 --> 00:27.853
Remember that trip we took
to Mackinac Island

00:27.897 --> 00:29.203
when Robin was three?

00:29.246 --> 00:31.640
No cars, nothing but horses.

00:31.683 --> 00:33.903
I remember
that "Rainbow Brite" t-shirt.

00:33.946 --> 00:36.471
Nothing but saltwater taffy
and ice cream.

00:36.514 --> 00:39.517
What a trip.
That was a great trip.

00:39.561 --> 00:42.738
No, it wasn't, Danny.
You were horribly depressed.

00:43.739 --> 00:46.350
You stayed in the hotel room,
laid in the bed,

00:46.394 --> 00:47.786
and stared at the ceiling.

00:47.830 --> 00:49.832
I kept telling Robin that
you wouldn't come down,

00:49.875 --> 00:52.878
because Daddy didn't feel good.

00:52.922 --> 00:54.402
Wow.

00:54.445 --> 00:59.363
I mean, I remember maybe
a couple of dark days.

00:59.407 --> 01:01.887
But, um, on the whole,
didn'tdidn't we have...

01:01.931 --> 01:04.977
Danny, what are you doing?

01:05.021 --> 01:08.068
I just thought you'd like
seeing these pictures.

01:08.111 --> 01:09.721
That's all, you know.

01:09.765 --> 01:13.725
I know you were trying
to rewrite history

01:13.769 --> 01:16.206
to paint a pretty picture

01:16.250 --> 01:18.250
of a happy marriage
and it wasn't always like that.

01:20.254 --> 01:22.299
It's pure fantasy, Danny.

01:24.475 --> 01:27.522
I know Med is not
a for-profit organization...

01:27.565 --> 01:30.046
But this report?

01:30.090 --> 01:31.439
If my board
saw numbers like this,

01:31.482 --> 01:33.702
they'd be calling for
a vote of no confidence.

01:34.398 --> 01:37.314
Mr. Rhodes, you can see
that one reason

01:37.358 --> 01:41.231
for our fiscal issues is
the E.D.'s Hybrid Room

01:41.275 --> 01:43.668
which you only partially funded.

01:46.280 --> 01:48.412
I think the rest of the Board
would agree with me

01:48.456 --> 01:50.762
that my contributions
have been more than generous.

01:50.806 --> 01:54.853
No, in fact, what I'm seeing is
a lot of your pet projects

01:54.897 --> 01:56.464
not working out so well.

01:56.507 --> 02:00.729
Let's look at the refurbishment
of the VIP wing.

02:00.772 --> 02:02.383
A lot of empty beds there.

02:02.426 --> 02:04.298
After Dr. Downey's death,

02:04.341 --> 02:07.257
we became less of aaa
destination hospital

02:07.301 --> 02:08.824
for our CT patients.

02:08.866 --> 02:11.827
We're still in the process
of re-branding.

02:11.870 --> 02:15.352
But in the meantime, since
you were such a vocal advocate

02:15.396 --> 02:18.355
of the Hybrid O.R., Sharon,

02:18.399 --> 02:20.966
it seems only fair that
you should find cuts

02:21.010 --> 02:25.188
in other departments to make up
for some of our losses.

02:25.232 --> 02:27.886
Well, I will certainly
take a look.

02:27.930 --> 02:31.194
But I'd hate to put us
in legal jeopardy

02:31.238 --> 02:32.674
or lose our reputation

02:32.717 --> 02:36.112
as the premier medical center
of the Midwest.

02:36.156 --> 02:39.507
Well said, Sharon.
Very, very well said.

02:39.550 --> 02:42.901
We certainly
would not want that.

02:44.512 --> 02:46.209
Mom, seriously, I'm fine.

02:46.253 --> 02:47.621
That's not what
you said this morning.

02:47.645 --> 02:49.169
You could hardly get out of bed.

02:49.212 --> 02:51.519
Jenny Simpson, 17.
Abdominal pain.

02:51.562 --> 02:53.477
Hi. I'm Dr. Manning.
This is Dr. Choi.

02:53.521 --> 02:54.304
Hi.

02:54.348 --> 02:55.697
Mom and dad?

02:55.740 --> 02:57.655
EEvie. That's my husband, Joel.

02:57.699 --> 02:59.004
Hi.

02:59.048 --> 03:00.789
This is so unnecessary.

03:00.832 --> 03:03.226
Itit was probably that
sketchy salad I had last night.

03:03.270 --> 03:05.054
Remember I said
it smelled weird?

03:05.097 --> 03:08.188
Jenny's been in pain since we
left Fort Wayne three days ago.

03:08.231 --> 03:09.667
Hoosiers? Winter getaway?

03:09.711 --> 03:12.322
College tour.
Jenny got into Northwestern.

03:12.366 --> 03:14.150
Perfect SATs.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.326
Wow, congratulations.

03:16.370 --> 03:18.328
Jenny, are you feeling
any nausea?

03:18.372 --> 03:21.331
I mean, a little
but I'm better now.

03:21.375 --> 03:23.290
I don't know why you guys
are freaking...

03:23.333 --> 03:25.205
Honey.

03:25.248 --> 03:26.902
We thought maybe appendicitis.

03:26.945 --> 03:28.295
No rebound tenderness.

03:28.338 --> 03:31.385
Heart rate 103.

03:31.428 --> 03:33.125
I told you itit's just
food poisoning.

03:33.169 --> 03:35.147
All right, well, I'd still
like to do a quick ultrasound

03:35.171 --> 03:37.236
just to see if I can get
a visual on the appendix, okay?

03:37.260 --> 03:38.870
An ultrasound?

03:38.914 --> 03:41.264
- It'll just take a second.
- No, II don't want that.

03:41.308 --> 03:43.440
- Honey.
- I want to go.

03:43.484 --> 03:45.660
Jenny, appendicitis is serious,

03:45.703 --> 03:48.706
but it's easily treatable
if we catch it early.

03:48.750 --> 03:51.231
But I have to take a look
to do that, okay?

03:54.103 --> 03:55.365
Jenny.

03:57.019 --> 03:59.761
Okay. I guess.

03:59.804 --> 04:01.371
Great.

04:03.000 --> 04:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:10.772 --> 04:13.253
Well, good news is, it
doesn't look like appendicitis.

04:13.296 --> 04:15.385
So what is it?

04:15.429 --> 04:17.300
Well, it's hard to tell
just yet.

04:17.344 --> 04:18.867
But I would like to run
some tests

04:18.910 --> 04:20.911
just to rule a few things out
if that's all right.

04:20.956 --> 04:22.914
- Of course.
- Yeah, absolutely.

04:22.958 --> 04:26.091
Monique, CBC, BMP, coags
and a quant hCG.

04:27.354 --> 04:28.485
We'll be back to check in

04:28.529 --> 04:30.052
once we get the test results in.

04:30.095 --> 04:31.923
Thank you.

04:33.664 --> 04:34.815
Did you see how scared she got

04:34.839 --> 04:36.580
when I mentioned the ultrasound?

04:36.624 --> 04:38.060
Yeah, she was pretty defensive.

04:38.103 --> 04:39.888
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Pregnancy?

04:39.931 --> 04:41.953
Thinking an endometrium,
but I didn't see an embryo.

04:41.977 --> 04:44.284
Well, she could've had
a miscarriage or an abortion.

04:44.327 --> 04:45.807
But whatever it is,

04:45.850 --> 04:47.959
she is definitely trying to
keep her parents in the dark.

04:47.983 --> 04:50.103
Yeah, but I don't think
that's going to be possible.

05:05.348 --> 05:07.437
Heads up, Maggie.

05:07.481 --> 05:08.675
There's probably going to be
more spending cuts coming down.

05:08.699 --> 05:10.222
More?

05:10.266 --> 05:12.790
Gwen hasn't met her goals
and she's feeling the heat.

05:12.834 --> 05:14.139
We're already short-staffed.

05:14.183 --> 05:15.813
We're using those cheapo
central line kits.

05:15.837 --> 05:17.142
What more does Gwen want?

05:17.186 --> 05:19.362
Speak of the devil.

05:19.406 --> 05:23.018
She's got a big fish
coming into the VIP wing.

05:23.061 --> 05:24.846
Ooh!

05:27.631 --> 05:29.459
Wow!

05:29.503 --> 05:31.069
Man, I love it.

05:31.113 --> 05:32.027
Thanks.

05:32.070 --> 05:34.203
It's a lot easier to manage.

05:37.380 --> 05:38.816
Hey.

05:38.860 --> 05:40.252
New hairdo?

05:40.296 --> 05:42.298
Hey.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.865
It looks good.

05:44.779 --> 05:47.434
So we still on?
Drinks for tonight?

05:50.611 --> 05:54.005
Um, I'm sorry.

05:54.049 --> 05:57.182
I can't. Something came up.

05:57.226 --> 05:59.489
Something?

05:59.533 --> 06:01.317
Yeah.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.363
Um, tomorrow then?

06:04.973 --> 06:07.062
That's not going to work either.

06:08.455 --> 06:10.021
This weekend?

06:10.065 --> 06:12.459
Can I let you know?

06:13.503 --> 06:15.723
Yeah. No big deal.

06:20.249 --> 06:22.120
New hairdo?

06:23.208 --> 06:25.863
Women don't do that
for no reason.

06:25.907 --> 06:27.125
I'm guessing there's a guy.

06:27.169 --> 06:29.301
You're suddenly an expert
on women.

06:29.345 --> 06:30.955
Too bad, Choi.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.526
I'll be using what's
called the "David Procedure"

06:36.570 --> 06:38.528
to resect your aneurysm.

06:38.572 --> 06:41.575
It will allow us to preserve
your native valve.

06:41.618 --> 06:43.620
Our Chief of CT, Dr. Latham,

06:43.664 --> 06:46.275
is going to be assisting me
on the operation.

06:46.318 --> 06:49.452
Do you have
any questions, concerns?

06:49.496 --> 06:53.108
No concerns.
My people did their research.

06:53.151 --> 06:54.718
You were at the top of the list,

06:54.762 --> 06:56.938
just under the late Dr. Downey.

06:56.981 --> 07:00.245
Dr. Rhodes was
Dr. Downey's star protégé.

07:00.289 --> 07:01.421
I'm aware.

07:01.464 --> 07:03.292
I wanted to let you know,
Mr. Montero,

07:03.335 --> 07:06.077
that as you recuperate, we can
offer you spa-like amenities.

07:06.121 --> 07:08.253
Massage, facials.

07:08.297 --> 07:10.386
With your doctor's
permission, of course.

07:12.214 --> 07:15.347
We also have a concierge
at your disposal.

07:15.391 --> 07:18.916
Here is a list of all
our personal services

07:18.960 --> 07:21.179
and our menu options.

07:23.965 --> 07:26.315
You can almost forget
you're in the hospital.

07:38.501 --> 07:41.461
Why is Dr. Rhodes scheduled
to operate on Mr. Montero?

07:41.504 --> 07:42.853
It's out of my hands.

07:42.897 --> 07:44.594
Dr. Rhodes is
on the trauma service.

07:44.638 --> 07:45.900
I'm the attending in CT.

07:45.943 --> 07:47.554
Mr. Montero's case
should've come to me.

07:47.597 --> 07:49.294
Dr. Bekker,

07:49.338 --> 07:53.037
Mr. Montero specifically
requested Dr. Rhodes

07:53.081 --> 07:56.388
and Mr. Montero
gets what he wants.

08:02.656 --> 08:05.180
Jenny Simpson's test results.

08:06.007 --> 08:08.488
What's going on with you
and Phillip?

08:08.531 --> 08:10.054
Are you seeing him?

08:10.098 --> 08:12.535
You know, like,
seeing him, seeing him?

08:14.537 --> 08:17.148
I thought it
was headed that way.

08:17.192 --> 08:20.021
He is a lovely guy, Maggie.

08:22.414 --> 08:24.068
But so is Big Red.

08:29.596 --> 08:31.815
It is way more complicated
than that and you know it.

08:37.342 --> 08:38.605
Ethan.

08:42.957 --> 08:45.046
Jenny, where are your parents?

08:45.089 --> 08:47.309
They went to get coffee.

08:48.223 --> 08:50.834
We have to ask you something.

08:50.878 --> 08:52.836
Jenny, we got
your blood work back

08:52.880 --> 08:54.795
and it indicates pregnancy.

08:54.838 --> 08:56.405
No, I'm not pregnant.

08:56.448 --> 08:59.495
- Let us explain.
- I'm not pregnant.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.976
We understand how hard this is.

09:02.019 --> 09:04.587
But your test results
and your symptoms

09:04.631 --> 09:07.285
shows that maybe you had
a miscarriage or...

09:07.329 --> 09:10.375
No. No, I didn't.
I don't want to talk about it.

09:10.419 --> 09:14.249
Jenny, in order for us
to treat you properly,

09:14.292 --> 09:16.207
we really need to know
what happened.

09:16.251 --> 09:19.254
Please, we are not here
to judge you.

09:19.297 --> 09:21.561
- No.
- We want to help you.

09:22.431 --> 09:25.695
The whole thing was stupid.

09:25.739 --> 09:28.524
So stupid.

09:29.394 --> 09:31.092
When I found out
that I was pregnant,

09:31.135 --> 09:33.355
I didn't know what to do.

09:33.398 --> 09:36.097
I'm finishing high school
and I'm going to college.

09:36.140 --> 09:37.620
I understand.

09:37.664 --> 09:40.971
So I went online andand
I read about these pills.

09:41.015 --> 09:42.625
And what were they?

09:42.669 --> 09:43.713
Mife-something.

09:43.757 --> 09:45.106
Mifepristone?

09:45.149 --> 09:47.499
Did you take the follow up pill
Misoprostol?

09:48.544 --> 09:51.416
I couldn't get it.
Not without a doctor.

09:51.460 --> 09:53.854
Jenny, that's why
you're in so much pain.

09:53.897 --> 09:56.770
Without the second pill,
you haven't fully aborted yet.

09:56.813 --> 09:58.902
Help me.

09:58.946 --> 10:00.338
Please.

10:00.382 --> 10:02.340
Just don't tell my parents.

10:02.384 --> 10:04.865
They'll hate me
and they'll never forgive me.

10:04.908 --> 10:06.344
Please.

10:06.388 --> 10:08.105
I think you might be
underestimating them.

10:08.129 --> 10:10.218
No, I know them
and you can't tell them.

10:10.261 --> 10:11.611
Jenny, I'm sorry...

10:11.654 --> 10:13.221
We're not going to tell
your parents

10:13.264 --> 10:14.918
but I am going to give you
the second pill

10:14.962 --> 10:17.834
so that you can expel whatever
is left in your uterus, okay?

10:17.878 --> 10:21.185
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

10:24.232 --> 10:25.886
Nat, she's a minor.

10:25.929 --> 10:28.584
We can't give her medications
without her parents' consent.

10:28.628 --> 10:29.672
Yes, we can.

10:29.716 --> 10:31.239
Dr. Manning?

10:31.282 --> 10:33.130
Have you found out what's wrong
with our daughter?

10:33.154 --> 10:35.286
We were actually
just discussing that.

10:35.330 --> 10:37.941
Unfortunately we're still
waiting on some test results.

10:37.985 --> 10:41.597
The best thing you can do
right now is just be patient.

10:41.641 --> 10:42.903
Waitwait, that's it?

10:42.946 --> 10:44.426
You have no idea?

10:44.469 --> 10:46.384
I know how frustrating
this must be

10:46.428 --> 10:49.083
but I promise you, we are doing
everything possible for Jenny.

10:49.126 --> 10:51.563
I'm sure that you are.

10:51.607 --> 10:53.174
Come on, hon.

10:56.830 --> 10:58.309
What do you think you're doing?

10:58.353 --> 11:00.181
I'm honoring
my patient's wishes.

11:00.224 --> 11:02.313
- And lying to her parents?
- I did not lie to them.

11:02.357 --> 11:03.880
You withheld the truth, Nat.

11:03.924 --> 11:05.708
They have a right to know.
A legal right.

11:05.752 --> 11:07.275
That's Jenny's call.

11:07.318 --> 11:09.494
If you have a problem with it,
take it up with Goodwin.

11:11.148 --> 11:13.673
Dr. Lanik, FBI medics
have landed.

11:13.716 --> 11:14.717
April, you're up.

11:17.459 --> 11:18.721
Special Agent Sam Pearson.

11:18.765 --> 11:20.331
Low speed motor vehicle
collision.

11:20.375 --> 11:23.857
GCS 10, LOC on site,
nasal airway in place.

11:23.900 --> 11:26.120
Hey, I know this guy.
Let me work him up.

11:26.163 --> 11:27.730
Self-starter.
Who am I to interfere?

11:30.037 --> 11:31.560
Okay, on my count.

11:31.603 --> 11:32.866
One, two, three.

11:35.085 --> 11:36.347
Hang in there, Sam. I got you.

11:36.391 --> 11:38.175
What's the story?
Air bags deployed,

11:38.219 --> 11:39.779
but his chest caught
most of the impact.

11:43.572 --> 11:45.158
He's not protecting
his airway, got to intubate.

11:45.182 --> 11:47.750
20 of etomidate, 100 of sux.
Get an x-ray in here.

11:53.016 --> 11:56.150
Meds are in.

11:56.193 --> 12:00.284
Heart rate 124, BP 132/88,
sats 95.

12:00.328 --> 12:02.025
I'm in. Bag him.

12:09.424 --> 12:11.774
Good breath sounds bilaterally.
Let's get that chest x-ray.

12:11.818 --> 12:14.646
Yes, Doctor.

12:16.605 --> 12:18.650
Clear.

12:18.694 --> 12:20.304
Chest shows multiple
rib fractures

12:20.348 --> 12:22.567
and bilateral pulmonary
contusions.

12:22.611 --> 12:24.700
I need a CBC, CMP, blood gas,
and coags.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.528
I'm seeing PVCs on the monitor.

12:26.571 --> 12:28.356
Got it.

12:30.401 --> 12:33.056
Is he going to be okay?

12:33.100 --> 12:34.797
Ingrid.

12:34.841 --> 12:36.799
He's in rough shape,
but stable for now.

12:36.843 --> 12:37.800
Were you with him?

12:37.844 --> 12:39.584
Yeah.

12:39.628 --> 12:41.673
- Let me check you out.
- No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

12:41.717 --> 12:44.981
Justjust keep my partner alive.

12:51.858 --> 12:54.121
Dr. Manning boxed us
into this situation.

12:54.164 --> 12:55.731
You want to talk about boxed in?

12:55.775 --> 12:57.341
The only reason
we're in this situation

12:57.385 --> 12:58.690
is because Jenny had no options.

12:58.734 --> 13:00.518
The family lives in Indiana.

13:00.562 --> 13:02.105
Where she would need
parental consent.

13:02.129 --> 13:03.652
And she was afraid
to talk to them,

13:03.695 --> 13:04.958
so there was nowhere else to go

13:05.001 --> 13:06.916
so she went online
to find medication.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.700
This generation's
back alley abortion.

13:08.744 --> 13:10.330
We don't make the laws
but we have to obey them.

13:10.354 --> 13:12.661
Jenny's a minor and that means
we have to tell her parents

13:12.704 --> 13:14.010
before we treat.

13:14.054 --> 13:15.882
No, her pregnancy test
is still positive.

13:15.925 --> 13:18.406
Therefore, under the law,
she is emancipated.

13:18.449 --> 13:19.799
She was pregnant. Not anymore.

13:19.842 --> 13:21.322
Technically she still is.

13:21.365 --> 13:22.584
Ms. Goodwin.

13:22.627 --> 13:24.673
I'll admit it's a thin argument.

13:24.716 --> 13:27.676
Emancipation covers
a woman's decisions

13:27.719 --> 13:29.417
regarding her pregnancy,

13:29.460 --> 13:31.027
but, my understanding

13:31.071 --> 13:35.118
is that Ms. Simpson
has already made her choice.

13:35.162 --> 13:36.903
So we betray this girl's trust?

13:36.946 --> 13:39.383
Well, that's not what
I'm suggesting.

13:39.427 --> 13:41.516
We have to obey the law
and tell her parents.

13:41.559 --> 13:43.431
That's not exactly right either.

13:43.474 --> 13:46.347
If we had provided
a medical abortion,

13:46.390 --> 13:48.175
which we didn't, then yes.

13:48.218 --> 13:49.611
The state of Illinois says

13:49.654 --> 13:51.743
we're obligated to inform
the parents.

13:51.787 --> 13:55.791
But since she obtained
the medication herself

13:55.835 --> 13:59.229
out-of state, I'm not so sure.

14:00.404 --> 14:02.754
So you intend to keep
the parents in the dark

14:02.798 --> 14:04.495
based on a technicality?

14:04.539 --> 14:06.933
No, because our patient asked
us to keep it confidential.

14:06.976 --> 14:09.631
Look, I would suggest
you continue to treat her

14:09.674 --> 14:11.720
according to her wishes

14:11.763 --> 14:14.810
until our lawyers make
a determination.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.769
Thank you, Ms. Goodwin.

14:25.603 --> 14:28.737
Why are you here?

14:28.780 --> 14:30.304
I'm scrubbing in
on your surgery.

14:30.347 --> 14:32.088
No, Dr. Latham is assisting.

14:32.132 --> 14:33.133
He reconsidered.

14:33.176 --> 14:35.178
So just like that,
he pulled out.

14:35.222 --> 14:36.919
What did you say to him?
Really, Connor?

14:36.963 --> 14:38.312
Why wasn't I consulted?

14:38.355 --> 14:39.942
Don't worry.
It's been made very clear to me

14:39.966 --> 14:41.445
that Mr. Montero is
your patient.

14:41.489 --> 14:43.273
I'm only here as
your humble assistant.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.711
By the way,
I had my last HIV test.

14:46.755 --> 14:49.671
I'm clear.

14:49.714 --> 14:51.064
I'm glad to hear it.

14:51.107 --> 14:52.911
Since you were the one who
so carelessly cut me,

14:52.935 --> 14:54.284
I thought you might be.

15:03.554 --> 15:05.600
How is she?

15:05.643 --> 15:07.819
Cuts and scrapes.
Nothing serious.

15:13.129 --> 15:14.391
Ingrid.

15:14.435 --> 15:16.567
How's Sam?

15:16.611 --> 15:18.743
Wait and see right now.

15:20.484 --> 15:22.269
Can I get you anything?

15:22.312 --> 15:25.098
No.

15:27.274 --> 15:30.277
Haven't seen you at
the dog park lately.

15:30.320 --> 15:32.279
It'swork.

15:36.979 --> 15:38.850
I'll keep you posted on Sam.

15:46.336 --> 15:47.685
Where are we?

15:47.729 --> 15:49.165
The PVCs were all unifocal,

15:49.209 --> 15:51.994
but his airway pressures
are bad.

15:52.038 --> 15:55.345
PaO2's at 50
and peak pressure's at 55.

15:55.389 --> 15:57.043
All this from a car crash?

15:57.086 --> 15:59.654
They said he wasn't
even going that fast.

15:59.697 --> 16:01.221
He shouldn't be this sick.

16:01.264 --> 16:03.832
Crank the O2 and
increase his PEEP to 12.

16:03.875 --> 16:05.486
See if we can improve
his oxygenation.

16:05.529 --> 16:06.704
Okay.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.279
These bruises.

16:16.323 --> 16:17.996
They don't look like
they're from an air bag.

16:18.020 --> 16:19.413
They're too extensive.

16:19.456 --> 16:22.111
The air bag shouldn't have
touched his legs.

16:22.155 --> 16:24.026
We still waiting
on those CT scans?

16:24.070 --> 16:25.525
Radiology's been slammed
all morning.

16:25.549 --> 16:27.266
Get him moved up.
Don't take no for an answer.

16:27.290 --> 16:28.683
These injuries
just don't add up.

16:28.726 --> 16:29.945
You got it.

16:36.691 --> 16:38.780
Proximal anastomosis done.

16:38.823 --> 16:40.042
I'm working on the distal now.

16:40.086 --> 16:42.044
Temp's coming up. 33 degrees.

16:43.045 --> 16:44.438
We need to move faster.

16:44.481 --> 16:45.743
Look, I realize that,

16:45.787 --> 16:47.702
but the graft is
coming down unevenly.

16:47.745 --> 16:50.748
If I keep tugging,
I could tear the aorta.

16:52.402 --> 16:54.709
A suggestion?

16:54.752 --> 16:56.232
What?

16:56.276 --> 16:58.234
Try pulling on the
non-coronary commissure.

16:58.278 --> 17:00.584
I think that'll move the graft
into proper position.

17:00.628 --> 17:02.282
Okay.

17:04.762 --> 17:06.373
That did it, thank you.

17:06.415 --> 17:07.896
Of course.

17:07.939 --> 17:09.593
All right,
let's finish the anastomosis.

17:09.637 --> 17:13.118
No, I haven't told him, but
I don't feel good about it.

17:13.162 --> 17:15.208
Don't you think he has
a right to know?

17:15.251 --> 17:18.166
I've got to go.
I'll talk to you later.

17:19.429 --> 17:21.127
You need something?

17:22.650 --> 17:24.347
No.

17:24.391 --> 17:25.957
Okay.

17:26.784 --> 17:29.874
Help! Dr. Manning! Dr. Choi!

17:31.659 --> 17:33.095
My God.

17:33.139 --> 17:34.923
- Help her!
- I feel dizzy.

17:34.966 --> 17:37.404
Jenny, keep looking at me.
Keep talking, okay?

17:37.447 --> 17:38.840
Mom.

17:38.883 --> 17:40.383
You'll be okay, honey.
Mommy is right here.

17:40.407 --> 17:41.930
- I don't feel good.
- God.

17:41.973 --> 17:43.366
What is happening
to my daughter?

17:43.410 --> 17:44.324
There's so much blood.

17:44.367 --> 17:45.716
It's a gynecologic hemorrhage.

17:45.760 --> 17:46.954
She's passing retained tissue...

17:46.978 --> 17:49.111
We need to control the bleed.

17:49.155 --> 17:51.374
Monique, hang a unit of typed
and crossed-matched blood,

17:51.418 --> 17:53.724
give her 0.2 milligrams
of methergine IM,

17:53.768 --> 17:55.987
and I need a stat CBC and coags.

17:57.467 --> 17:59.600
Wait, we need
her parental consent.

17:59.643 --> 18:01.167
Ethan.

18:01.210 --> 18:03.952
To start the transfusion
and administer the medication.

18:03.995 --> 18:05.606
Yeah, whwhatever you need to do.

18:07.695 --> 18:09.305
Go ahead.

18:16.878 --> 18:20.055
I may have distorted the
graft with that last stitch.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.492
I'm doing this backhand.
Do you have a better angle?

18:22.536 --> 18:24.146
I think so.

18:30.196 --> 18:31.632
Dr. Rhodes's phone.

18:31.675 --> 18:32.981
Take a message.

18:33.024 --> 18:34.306
All right,
last couple of stitches

18:34.330 --> 18:35.853
then we're coming off pump.

18:35.897 --> 18:38.943
- Dr. Rhodes?
- I said take a message.

18:38.987 --> 18:41.120
Dr. Rhodes, he says
it's an emergency.

18:42.077 --> 18:43.557
All right.

18:45.341 --> 18:48.344
Look, I'm in the middle
of an operation.

18:48.388 --> 18:50.172
What?

18:50.216 --> 18:52.566
Is this some kind of joke?

18:53.567 --> 18:55.351
How do I know that?

18:57.223 --> 19:00.008
All right. All right, all right.

19:00.051 --> 19:01.575
Whatwhat do you want me to do?

19:01.618 --> 19:03.316
What is it?

19:03.359 --> 19:05.231
Okay, yeah, okay.

19:05.274 --> 19:07.189
Yeah, look.

19:07.233 --> 19:09.539
No, I won't hang up. I promise.

19:11.715 --> 19:13.456
- I have to leave.
- What?

19:13.500 --> 19:15.023
Finish the anastomosis.

19:15.066 --> 19:16.503
Check the competency
of the valve.

19:16.546 --> 19:17.939
Connor, no!

19:17.982 --> 19:19.612
You've done this before.
You'll be fine.

19:19.636 --> 19:20.985
- That's not...
- No!

19:21.029 --> 19:22.596
I'm notl'm not hanging up.
I promise.

19:22.639 --> 19:24.269
All right, we have
a patient on the table.

19:24.293 --> 19:25.686
Let's get back to work.

19:27.035 --> 19:28.689
I just left the operating room.

19:28.732 --> 19:30.038
I'm headed out now.

19:30.081 --> 19:31.518
You finished already,
Dr. Rhodes?

19:31.561 --> 19:33.346
No, I'm still here.
Okay, I won't hang up.

19:33.389 --> 19:34.564
Dr. Rhodes?

19:45.488 --> 19:46.924
No, I'm still here.
I'm still here.

19:46.968 --> 19:48.883
The elevator is really slow.

19:50.798 --> 19:53.627
Look, I'm moving as fast
as I can, man, I promise.

19:55.759 --> 19:58.022
Can I talk to her?

19:58.066 --> 20:00.199
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

20:01.635 --> 20:03.376
I'll do whatever you say.

20:04.725 --> 20:06.683
All right, I'm leaving now.

20:06.727 --> 20:08.076
Just please, don't hurt her.

20:08.119 --> 20:09.556
Robin, it's Dad.

20:09.599 --> 20:11.732
Can you, um, can you call me
as soon as you get this?

20:11.775 --> 20:14.735
My bank is on the corner
of LaSalle and Van Buren.

20:14.778 --> 20:16.171
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

20:31.882 --> 20:34.276
Trudy, it's Dan Charles.

20:34.320 --> 20:37.497
I-I need to speak
to Hank Voight immediately.

20:43.938 --> 20:45.896
What the hell is going on
with Dr. Rhodes?

20:45.940 --> 20:47.289
What do you mean?

20:47.333 --> 20:48.701
Halfway through
Mr. Montero's surgery,

20:48.725 --> 20:50.466
he left the O.R.
and the hospital.

20:50.510 --> 20:51.772
What?

20:51.815 --> 20:53.730
You know how important
this patient is to us

20:53.774 --> 20:55.428
and if his outcome is less
than perfect,

20:55.471 --> 20:57.386
I will fire Dr. Rhodes

20:57.430 --> 20:59.345
and that'll be the least
of his problems.

20:59.388 --> 21:02.478
I'll sue him and then
I'll bring him up on charges.

21:02.522 --> 21:05.351
I know there is a reasonable
explanation for this.

21:05.394 --> 21:07.831
If this blows up, Sharon,

21:07.875 --> 21:10.660
he won't be the only one
without a job.

21:18.320 --> 21:19.974
I'm heading east on Lake.

21:20.017 --> 21:22.324
You're lateyou said you'd
be there in 20 minutes.

21:22.368 --> 21:23.804
I can't help the traffic.

21:23.847 --> 21:25.327
Are you playing games with me?

21:25.371 --> 21:27.895
I am doing the best I can!

21:27.938 --> 21:30.332
Whatever happens to Robin,
that's on you, man!

21:30.376 --> 21:33.161
Justjust don't touch her!

21:36.860 --> 21:38.645
Move! Move!

21:52.572 --> 21:55.357
Since your patient,
Jenny Simpson, is a minor,

21:55.401 --> 21:58.012
legal is concerned
about liability.

21:58.055 --> 21:59.361
Of course they are.

21:59.405 --> 22:01.711
Bottom line,
if you feel the need

22:01.755 --> 22:03.496
for any further
medical procedures,

22:03.539 --> 22:06.063
you must obtain
parental consent.

22:06.107 --> 22:07.717
Good, thank you.

22:10.416 --> 22:11.982
This isn't right.

22:12.026 --> 22:15.377
I'm sorry, Dr. Manning, but
you've given her Methergine.

22:15.421 --> 22:16.683
- Yes?
- Yes.

22:16.726 --> 22:19.033
So let's hope she passes
any retained tissue

22:19.076 --> 22:21.905
and that should take care of it.

22:24.386 --> 22:25.735
Hi.

22:25.779 --> 22:27.998
Could we have a moment
to examine Jenny?

22:28.042 --> 22:29.217
Of course.

22:29.260 --> 22:30.586
When are we going
to know something?

22:30.610 --> 22:33.177
Honey, let them do their job.

22:33.221 --> 22:35.005
Come on.

22:35.049 --> 22:36.790
Thank you.

22:38.052 --> 22:39.923
How are you feeling, Jenny?

22:39.967 --> 22:41.403
Not good?

22:41.447 --> 22:43.120
Well, I'm going to do
an internal exam, okay?

22:43.144 --> 22:45.538
So I just need you to lift up
your legs just like that

22:45.581 --> 22:48.105
and then just let them
fall open.

22:48.149 --> 22:49.759
Perfect. Um, and I apologize.

22:49.803 --> 22:52.588
This is going to be
a little uncomfortable, okay?

22:52.632 --> 22:54.024
Thank you.

22:54.068 --> 22:55.896
All right, you ready?

22:58.986 --> 23:00.727
You okay?

23:04.339 --> 23:06.428
What is it?

23:07.473 --> 23:09.475
Well, your body hasn't
expelled all the tissue

23:09.518 --> 23:11.433
related to the pregnancy.

23:11.477 --> 23:13.479
The medication we gave you
is supposed to help

23:13.522 --> 23:15.263
but unfortunately,
you're still bleeding.

23:15.306 --> 23:18.701
It means you're going to need
a D&C, dilation and curettage,

23:18.745 --> 23:21.574
a surgical procedure
to remove the tissue.

23:21.617 --> 23:24.664
But we do need your parents'
permission for this.

23:24.707 --> 23:27.275
N-no. You can't tell them.

23:27.318 --> 23:28.581
We have to.

23:28.624 --> 23:30.036
Jenny, your temperature
is elevated,

23:30.060 --> 23:32.715
which means you could be
developing endometritis,

23:32.759 --> 23:35.152
which is a very serious
infection.

23:35.196 --> 23:36.589
It could be life-threatening.

23:36.632 --> 23:39.026
No. No, no!

23:39.069 --> 23:41.550
Jenny, I know you're afraid
of what your parents will say,

23:41.594 --> 23:46.468
but they love you and they
would never want to lose you.

23:48.731 --> 23:51.778
So I'm going to go talk
to them, okay?

23:51.821 --> 23:52.953
Wait.

23:55.999 --> 23:58.393
My mom...

23:58.437 --> 24:00.221
Ask my mom to come in.

24:00.264 --> 24:01.918
Okay.

24:04.834 --> 24:07.794
Mrs. Simpson, Jenny would like
to talk to you.

24:09.535 --> 24:13.364
Um, hey, why don't you,
go get a cup of coffee?

24:13.408 --> 24:16.977
I-I think this is
mother-daughter talk.

24:17.020 --> 24:19.327
No, it'll be okay.

24:28.075 --> 24:30.120
Agent Pearson's CT results.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.128
Is something wrong?

24:42.568 --> 24:45.571
Sam's CAT scan.

24:45.614 --> 24:48.008
Bilateral diffuse
pulmonary white out,

24:48.051 --> 24:50.184
bilateral subclinical
pneumothoraces,

24:50.227 --> 24:53.013
sternal fracture,
subcapsular liver hematoma...

24:53.056 --> 24:54.580
What does all that mean?

24:54.623 --> 24:57.147
Looks like blast lung.

24:57.191 --> 24:59.672
These injuries were
not caused by a car crash.

24:59.715 --> 25:02.022
Ingrid, what really happened?

25:03.719 --> 25:05.852
Tell me.

25:05.895 --> 25:07.636
Will it affect
how you treat him?

25:07.680 --> 25:09.333
Of course it will!

25:11.771 --> 25:13.947
- What happened?
- Okay.

25:13.990 --> 25:18.386
Wethere was an explosion
and Sam took the brunt of it.

25:18.429 --> 25:20.214
What kind of explosion?

25:20.257 --> 25:21.694
A meth lab.

25:21.737 --> 25:23.086
What are we talking about then?

25:23.130 --> 25:26.437
Acetone peroxide?
Red phosphorus?

25:26.481 --> 25:28.222
Yes.

25:28.265 --> 25:29.571
What else can you tell us?

25:32.792 --> 25:33.880
Ingrid!

25:33.923 --> 25:35.577
God's sakes, Will,
isn't that enough?

25:37.187 --> 25:39.146
Convert him to lung
protective ventilation.

25:39.189 --> 25:42.323
Drop the tidal volume to 4 cc's
per kilo and up his rate to 28.

25:42.366 --> 25:44.064
On it.

25:56.642 --> 25:58.644
You. I knew it.

25:58.687 --> 26:00.733
I knew it all along.

26:00.776 --> 26:03.344
You had no right
to keep this from us.

26:03.387 --> 26:04.737
It was Jenny's wish.

26:04.780 --> 26:07.435
Well, of course she didn't
want us to find out.

26:07.478 --> 26:09.611
She knew it was wrong.

26:09.655 --> 26:13.484
What she did waswas murder.

26:13.528 --> 26:15.008
Mrs. Simpson, um,

26:15.051 --> 26:17.706
you should know that Jenny
didn't want to tell you

26:17.750 --> 26:20.143
because she was afraid you
wouldn't love her anymore.

26:21.884 --> 26:23.582
No...

26:25.192 --> 26:27.107
No.

26:27.150 --> 26:28.412
No, no, no.

26:28.456 --> 26:30.632
Listen, no matter what
your beliefs are,

26:30.676 --> 26:34.157
that's your daughter
and she's very sick.

26:36.986 --> 26:40.076
Look, can I give
the consent for the D&C

26:40.120 --> 26:41.556
without my husband?

26:41.600 --> 26:43.036
Yes.

26:44.385 --> 26:47.518
Do whatever you have to do
to save my daughter.

26:47.562 --> 26:49.216
Just don't tell Joel
what happened.

26:49.259 --> 26:51.435
I don't want this
to destroy my family.

26:51.479 --> 26:54.264
But doesn't he have
the right to know?

26:54.308 --> 26:55.483
He's her father.

26:57.050 --> 26:58.573
Actually...

26:58.617 --> 27:00.967
Actually, he isn't.

27:02.490 --> 27:05.145
And no, I never told him.

27:19.463 --> 27:20.726
All right, I'm here.

27:23.119 --> 27:25.513
Ginny, Ginny, hi. Hi.

27:25.556 --> 27:27.689
Hello, Dr. Rhodes,
what can I do for you?

27:27.733 --> 27:29.473
I need to take $50,000

27:29.517 --> 27:31.562
out of my money market account
in cash.

27:31.606 --> 27:33.086
Cash?

27:33.129 --> 27:35.001
Yes and please,
I am in a bit of a hurry.

27:35.044 --> 27:36.698
It'll take a few minutes.

27:36.742 --> 27:38.918
I'm not sure the tellers
have that much on hand.

27:38.961 --> 27:41.181
I may need to go into the vault.

27:41.224 --> 27:43.487
Ginny, whatever it takes,
just please do it. Thank you.

27:46.447 --> 27:47.840
All right, did you hear that?

27:47.883 --> 27:50.407
It's going to take awhile.

27:50.451 --> 27:52.366
No. No, no, no, no, no.

27:52.409 --> 27:54.542
I-I-I-I didn't call them.
I swear!

27:54.585 --> 27:57.763
No, no. No, no, no. They...
Theythey can't be outside!

27:57.806 --> 27:59.634
I didn't call them!
Please! Please!

27:59.678 --> 28:00.983
No, no, no! Don't hang up!

28:01.027 --> 28:02.724
I am getting you the money!

28:02.768 --> 28:06.728
Hello? Hello, you there?
Youhello?

28:06.772 --> 28:09.470
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

28:09.513 --> 28:10.776
No!

28:14.867 --> 28:16.607
No! No, no, no, no!

28:16.651 --> 28:18.174
I told you not
to call the police!

28:18.218 --> 28:19.543
They saw you!
They're going to kill her!

28:19.567 --> 28:20.936
- They're not.
- You don't know that.

28:20.960 --> 28:22.135
- Yes, I do.
- Dr. Rhodes.

28:22.178 --> 28:23.440
Robin was never kidnapped.

28:23.484 --> 28:24.679
No, she was.
I-I-I-I-I heard her.

28:24.703 --> 28:25.921
I heard her scream!

28:25.965 --> 28:29.708
- It wasn't her, buddy.
- No, it's a scam.

28:29.751 --> 28:31.710
Dr. Rhodes, it's a scam.

28:31.753 --> 28:32.928
Scam?

28:32.972 --> 28:34.321
When I finally reached Robin,

28:34.364 --> 28:36.584
she had no idea what
I was talking about.

28:36.627 --> 28:39.848
Youyou spoke to her
and she's fine?

28:39.892 --> 28:41.894
Was never in any danger.

28:56.517 --> 28:59.389
Watch out.

28:59.433 --> 29:02.392
BP 92 over 56. Heart rate 48.

29:02.436 --> 29:04.830
Sats 73 and dropping.

29:06.092 --> 29:07.615
He's bradying down.

29:09.138 --> 29:10.879
Bilateral tension
pneumothoraces.

29:10.923 --> 29:12.098
Two needle kits?

29:12.141 --> 29:13.664
Yeah, gotta decompress
his chest.

29:13.708 --> 29:14.970
What's happening?

29:15.014 --> 29:16.842
Air's leaking into his
chest from his lungs.

29:16.885 --> 29:18.017
Now his lungs can't inflate.

29:21.672 --> 29:23.892
Second needle?

29:28.636 --> 29:30.072
Sats and heart rate climbing.

29:30.116 --> 29:31.595
Set up for bilateral
chest tubes.

29:31.639 --> 29:33.815
Otherwise his lungs are just
going to collapse again.

29:33.859 --> 29:35.425
Right.

29:35.469 --> 29:37.664
We'll need to send him up to
the ICU and get him on ECMO.

29:37.688 --> 29:39.299
Is this because you didn't know?

29:39.342 --> 29:41.823
It didn't help, Ingrid.

29:52.007 --> 29:53.617
Evie.

29:53.661 --> 29:55.619
What's happening?
Where are they taking her?

29:55.663 --> 29:57.578
They'll explain.

29:58.579 --> 30:01.582
We're starting your daughter
on broad spectrum antibiotics

30:01.625 --> 30:03.714
and we're taking her up
to surgery.

30:03.758 --> 30:05.455
Why?

30:05.499 --> 30:08.589
Wewe were unable
to stop her bleeding,

30:08.632 --> 30:12.549
and also we were concerned
she could become septic.

30:12.593 --> 30:14.029
God.

30:14.073 --> 30:17.772
The procedure to address
this is simple, very low-risk.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.078
In all likelihood,

30:19.121 --> 30:21.123
she'll be able to go home
with you tomorrow.

30:21.167 --> 30:23.865
Okay.

30:23.909 --> 30:25.867
I'm still not clear.

30:25.911 --> 30:27.390
This procedure...

30:27.434 --> 30:29.262
It's to remove
degenerating tissue

30:29.305 --> 30:30.698
that's trapped in her uterus.

30:30.741 --> 30:32.874
- Her uterus?
- That's right.

30:37.270 --> 30:41.187
Okay, as long as she's
going to be all right.

30:41.230 --> 30:42.753
Yeah.

30:42.797 --> 30:44.799
Do you have
any further questions?

30:47.541 --> 30:50.849
- No. No.
- Okay.

30:50.892 --> 30:53.677
Then why don't we have
someone take you up

30:53.721 --> 30:55.157
to the waiting area?

30:55.201 --> 30:58.334
Monique, take Mr. Simpson
upstairs to join his wife.

30:58.378 --> 31:00.423
Sure. This way, sir.

31:00.467 --> 31:01.903
Thank you.

31:10.216 --> 31:11.608
Robin.

31:11.652 --> 31:13.045
- Hey.
- My God.

31:13.088 --> 31:15.395
It's okay. I'm fine.

31:15.438 --> 31:18.180
I wasuh, I-I was just
so worried.

31:18.224 --> 31:21.923
You knowDad, you know
I go swimming during lunch.

31:21.967 --> 31:24.404
Do I know that?

31:24.447 --> 31:25.709
I don't think I know that.

31:25.753 --> 31:27.929
Yeah, well,
maybe you should listen.

31:27.973 --> 31:29.515
How were they even able
to pull this off?

31:29.539 --> 31:31.411
I mean, they must've known
so much about you.

31:31.454 --> 31:33.282
The cops said they
must've hacked my email.

31:33.326 --> 31:36.416
I mean, apparently this sort of
scam has been happening a lot.

31:38.940 --> 31:40.159
I'm really sorry.

31:40.202 --> 31:41.397
I-I-I've got
to get back to the O.R.

31:41.421 --> 31:43.771
I'm fine, Connor. Go.

31:43.814 --> 31:46.992
- Okay, thank you.
- And change your passwords.

31:51.474 --> 31:53.041
Dr. Rhodes?

31:53.085 --> 31:54.889
Ms. Goodwin, I will explain
everything when I can

31:54.913 --> 31:57.045
but Iright now I have got
to get back to the O.R.

31:57.089 --> 31:59.265
There's no hurry.

32:00.396 --> 32:02.050
- Mr. Montero?
- Did fine.

32:02.094 --> 32:03.965
They're closing him up now.

32:05.053 --> 32:07.142
Um...

32:07.186 --> 32:08.578
that's good.

32:08.622 --> 32:10.580
Since you ran out in
the middle of the surgery,

32:10.624 --> 32:12.974
I'd say it's very good.

32:13.018 --> 32:15.672
And now you have time
to tell me what happened.

32:22.636 --> 32:23.767
Hey.

32:23.811 --> 32:27.946
Sam is stable, on ECMO.

32:27.989 --> 32:30.687
That'll take the strain off
his lungs so they can heal.

32:30.731 --> 32:34.387
He's got a long road ahead of
him but he should pull through.

32:34.430 --> 32:36.128
Good.

32:36.171 --> 32:39.000
And look, I'm sorry.

32:39.044 --> 32:41.742
Even if I had known earlier
what caused his injuries,

32:41.785 --> 32:44.440
I don't think it would have
made a difference.

32:44.484 --> 32:46.486
Thank you.

32:47.400 --> 32:49.097
You can go and see him.

32:50.707 --> 32:52.100
Okay.

32:52.144 --> 32:55.277
You're still not gonna
tell me what happened?

33:16.951 --> 33:19.388
We're fortunate Dr. Bekker
was able to take over

33:19.432 --> 33:23.262
for Dr. Rhodes when
he became incapacitated.

33:23.305 --> 33:25.786
She is a brilliant surgeon

33:25.829 --> 33:29.659
and she's proven herself a
worthy successor to Dr. Downey.

33:33.315 --> 33:35.056
Thank you.

33:35.100 --> 33:37.667
You're most welcome.

33:43.847 --> 33:47.634
I think we can all agree
that, thanks to Dr. Bekker,

33:47.677 --> 33:49.027
we're on our way to becoming

33:49.070 --> 33:50.637
a destination hospital
once again.

33:59.124 --> 34:00.821
I heard what happened.

34:00.864 --> 34:02.649
That's awful.

34:02.692 --> 34:05.043
But Robin's okay?
It was just a scam?

34:05.869 --> 34:08.697
- Yeah.
- So cruel.

34:08.742 --> 34:10.483
Well, thank you for stepping in.

34:10.525 --> 34:12.485
Of course.

34:12.527 --> 34:14.574
I'm going to go
write up my notes.

34:18.012 --> 34:20.406
Looks like it all worked out
well for her.

34:22.842 --> 34:24.322
Yeah.

34:37.597 --> 34:39.599
Dr. Choi, Dr. Manning.

34:39.641 --> 34:41.688
I thought Jenny might be hungry.

34:43.168 --> 34:44.908
And I wanted to thank you.

34:44.952 --> 34:46.693
The OB said she's gonna be fine.

34:46.735 --> 34:48.563
Yes, everything went well.

34:48.608 --> 34:51.437
Yeah. She's a good girl.

34:51.480 --> 34:53.699
Mr. Simpson.

34:55.440 --> 34:56.746
Take care.

34:56.790 --> 34:58.705
I will. Thanks.

34:59.923 --> 35:04.798
That man's being lied to
by us, his wife, his daughter.

35:04.841 --> 35:07.017
I don't get you, Ethan.

35:07.061 --> 35:09.281
You believe that everyone
has a right to make decisions

35:09.324 --> 35:10.499
about their own body.

35:10.543 --> 35:12.806
It's not that.
It's the dishonesty.

35:12.849 --> 35:15.417
Listen, some people
don't want honesty.

35:15.461 --> 35:18.681
They find living with a lie
to be a lot easier.

35:20.379 --> 35:23.033
Not me.

35:28.343 --> 35:30.258
April?

35:31.868 --> 35:33.566
April, it's Ethan.

35:33.609 --> 35:35.785
Ethan, what are you doing?

35:35.829 --> 35:37.918
Ifif you're seeing another guy,

35:37.961 --> 35:40.050
just tell me the truth.

35:40.094 --> 35:42.401
Yyou have no right
to come to my apartment

35:42.444 --> 35:44.098
demanding anything.

35:44.142 --> 35:46.709
You keep making excuses.
You cut your hair.

35:46.753 --> 35:49.756
My hair? So what?

35:49.799 --> 35:53.020
Just be honest with me.
I can handle it.

35:53.063 --> 35:55.196
You're going to wake the baby.

35:55.240 --> 35:56.937
Emily.

35:57.807 --> 36:00.245
Why don't you come in?

36:20.482 --> 36:23.964
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:24.007 --> 36:26.880
They're probably not going
to extubate him for a few days.

36:26.923 --> 36:29.448
You should go home,
get some rest.

36:29.491 --> 36:31.101
Okay.

36:37.107 --> 36:40.328
Will, it wasn't
because of security

36:40.372 --> 36:42.417
that I didn't tell you.

36:42.461 --> 36:43.766
I trust you.

36:45.464 --> 36:46.813
Then why?

36:49.294 --> 36:51.861
I just didn't want
to burden you with it.

36:52.949 --> 36:54.342
Ingrid.

36:57.084 --> 37:00.218
I'm not really good
at letting people in,

37:00.261 --> 37:02.307
but I do know...

37:02.350 --> 37:06.049
sometimes burdens are easier
to bear if they're shared.

37:07.834 --> 37:10.097
You can tell me.

37:14.101 --> 37:15.624
Tell me.

37:18.845 --> 37:21.978
That raid on the meth lab?

37:22.022 --> 37:24.938
The suspect was supposed
to be alone,

37:24.981 --> 37:27.549
but he had his kids with him.

37:27.593 --> 37:30.291
Twins, girls, six years old.

37:30.335 --> 37:35.775
And, um, rather than surrender,
he lit a match.

37:38.734 --> 37:40.823
Um...

37:42.347 --> 37:46.612
After the explosion when
the smoke started to clear,

37:46.655 --> 37:49.876
I could see that Sam was down.

37:49.919 --> 37:52.313
And then I, um...

37:53.749 --> 37:56.361
I just saw bits of them
everywhere

37:58.188 --> 38:01.366
and then in the middle
of all it...

38:01.409 --> 38:06.153
I-I saw a little girl's toy,
a pink unicorn.

38:06.196 --> 38:08.503
It was perfect.

38:08.547 --> 38:12.159
There wasn't a scratch on it.

38:22.256 --> 38:23.823
I got you.

38:28.393 --> 38:30.046
Bernie just needs some time.

38:30.090 --> 38:32.222
So April said I could
stay with her.

38:32.266 --> 38:33.591
But what's he doing at
his wife's?

38:33.615 --> 38:35.487
- He left her.
- He did.

38:35.530 --> 38:39.099
But he misses her
and he misses his daughter.

38:39.142 --> 38:40.642
So we talked about it
and thought it would be good

38:40.666 --> 38:43.799
if they spent some time
together and, you know,

38:43.843 --> 38:45.410
just work things out.

38:45.453 --> 38:47.194
Work what things out?
He has a baby.

38:47.237 --> 38:49.588
- Your baby.
- She knows that.

38:49.631 --> 38:51.241
Obviously you're fine with this.

38:51.285 --> 38:53.243
They're doing the best
they can, Ethan.

38:53.287 --> 38:55.420
It doesn't sound that way to me.

38:56.812 --> 38:59.511
See, this is why I didn't
want him to know.

38:59.554 --> 39:00.947
Okay, come here.

39:00.990 --> 39:03.515
Don't you want
to meet your nephew?

39:03.558 --> 39:05.386
Come here, Em.

39:05.430 --> 39:07.910
Come on.

39:14.439 --> 39:15.701
His name is Vincent.

39:18.312 --> 39:19.748
Vincent.

39:21.446 --> 39:23.230
After Grandpa.

39:26.538 --> 39:30.498
You know, I did cut
my hair because of a guy.

39:31.760 --> 39:33.936
Vincent likes to pull on it.

39:37.940 --> 39:40.465
Yes, I got that.

39:40.508 --> 39:41.814
Hey, Ma?

39:41.857 --> 39:43.685
So Dad has had a bit of
a rough day

39:43.729 --> 39:46.819
and wants to know if we can
all go out to dinner together.

39:46.862 --> 39:49.169
So why isn't
he asking me himself?

39:49.212 --> 39:51.867
I wouldn't want you to think

39:51.911 --> 39:53.695
that I was being manipulative.

39:56.045 --> 39:57.830
Tell him I like steak.

40:00.485 --> 40:03.749
Not for nothing, you were
absolutely right this morning

40:03.792 --> 40:05.359
about Mackinac Island.

40:05.403 --> 40:07.492
Okay, now you're being
really manipulative.
