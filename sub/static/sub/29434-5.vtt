WEBVTT

00:05.296 --> 00:07.799
It's unorthodox
to give a forensic result

00:07.882 --> 00:09.426
to a family member.

00:09.509 --> 00:11.428
I'm a federal agent.
I can handle it.

00:11.511 --> 00:13.430
You can.
But should you?

00:13.513 --> 00:16.015
There are a lot of reasons
this is a bad idea, Chris.

00:16.099 --> 00:19.436
This investigation
being the least of them.

00:19.519 --> 00:21.980
No one will blame you

00:22.063 --> 00:24.441
or judge you for
handing this off.

00:24.524 --> 00:26.943
I appreciate your concern,

00:27.026 --> 00:30.613
both of you, but I need to find
my brother's killers.

00:30.697 --> 00:34.075
All right? I let him down.
I... got to square it.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.925
The fire did
superficial damage.

00:52.177 --> 00:54.179
Because of the humidity
of the area

00:54.262 --> 00:55.430
where the body was placed,

00:55.513 --> 00:57.932
there was ample tissue left

00:58.016 --> 00:59.934
to ascertain that

01:00.018 --> 01:02.854
he was stabbed three times.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.483
Could it have been
a fight gone wrong?

01:06.566 --> 01:08.359
It's unlikely.

01:08.443 --> 01:10.653
Vital organs
were targeted.

01:10.737 --> 01:12.489
In my professional opinion,
this was someone

01:12.572 --> 01:13.823
who knew what they were doing

01:13.907 --> 01:16.493
and had intent. Uh...

01:16.576 --> 01:18.495
The end would have come
very quickly.

01:16.576 --> 01:18.495
LASALLE: You're thinking

01:18.578 --> 01:21.039
it was an assassin?

01:22.582 --> 01:24.793
I can't say for sure,
but the suspect

01:24.876 --> 01:28.379
had training, experience.

01:30.882 --> 01:33.510
Did you find anything else

01:33.593 --> 01:35.595
that might help us,
Miss Loretta?

01:36.679 --> 01:38.723
Uh, the body...

01:41.601 --> 01:43.520
Cade was set on the ground

01:43.603 --> 01:45.897
before the fire
was set.

01:45.980 --> 01:48.316
The condition of the skin

01:48.399 --> 01:49.692
that was in contact
with the ground

01:49.776 --> 01:53.655
and protected
from the flame...

01:54.781 --> 01:56.533
...indicates that,

01:56.616 --> 01:59.244
uh, his body bled out
someplace else

01:59.327 --> 02:01.621
and then moved to the woods.

02:06.125 --> 02:07.502
Christopher.

02:07.585 --> 02:08.586
I'm good.

02:08.670 --> 02:09.587
Well, I'm not.

02:09.671 --> 02:11.714
Can I give you a hug?

02:21.307 --> 02:23.601
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom ♪

02:23.685 --> 02:26.229
♪ Bang, bang, bang, bang ♪

02:26.312 --> 02:28.523
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom ♪

02:28.606 --> 02:29.774
♪ How, how, how, how ♪

02:29.858 --> 02:33.111
♪ Hey, hey ♪

02:38.157 --> 02:39.701

02:41.494 --> 02:44.581
WILL:
No. No.

02:44.664 --> 02:46.207
No.

02:46.291 --> 02:48.960
No.

02:49.043 --> 02:51.588
I'm-I'm sorry. I can't find him.

02:51.671 --> 02:54.048
Okay. Let's take a break.

02:51.671 --> 02:54.048
I want to keep going.

02:54.132 --> 02:57.010
It's my fault Cade went to talk
to him in the first place.

02:57.093 --> 02:59.053
It's not your fault.
It's the fault of a guy

02:59.137 --> 03:01.389
that got you caught up in
something illegal to begin with.

03:01.472 --> 03:03.933
Isn't there an easier way
that we could find him?

03:04.017 --> 03:05.560
HANNAH: There was
a security camera at the park,

03:05.643 --> 03:07.520
but someone vandalized it.

03:07.604 --> 03:10.064
Probably because of the business
that was going on there.

03:10.148 --> 03:12.233
Can't we just hack into all
the kids' phones or something?

03:12.317 --> 03:15.945
Without a warrant, which we have
no way to get right now,

03:16.029 --> 03:17.447
that would be illegal.

03:17.530 --> 03:19.657
SEBASTIAN:
Will is halfway to a great idea.

03:22.201 --> 03:23.453
How'd you get these?

03:23.536 --> 03:24.704
Oh, it's called geotagging.

03:24.787 --> 03:26.581
These kids put
their entire lives online.

03:26.664 --> 03:28.833
I just did a social media search
for the basketball court.

03:28.917 --> 03:32.045
Will, see if you can identify
Shorty in any of those pictures.

03:35.715 --> 03:38.426
WILL:
Stop.

03:38.509 --> 03:40.303
The guy in the back
with the cell phone.

03:40.386 --> 03:42.305
That's Shorty.

03:42.388 --> 03:44.015
Nice work.

03:42.388 --> 03:44.015
All right, I'll get with Patton,

03:44.098 --> 03:45.642
start facial recognition.

03:44.098 --> 03:45.642
Yeah.

03:45.725 --> 03:48.144
I helped?

03:45.725 --> 03:48.144
Yeah. Enough to
earn you a donut.

03:48.227 --> 03:50.188
Come on.

03:51.439 --> 03:52.941
ROY:
You folks have a walk-in.

03:53.024 --> 03:55.026
I'm, uh, Lieutenant Landry,

03:55.109 --> 03:56.486
Aviation Maintenance Duty
Officer out of Stennis,

03:56.569 --> 03:58.446
Special Projects.

03:58.529 --> 03:59.864
And I'm Special Agent Hannah
Khoury. How can we help you?

03:59.948 --> 04:04.494
I'm working on
a top secret project and, um...

04:05.578 --> 04:06.996
Uh...

04:07.080 --> 04:09.958
This-this was a bad idea.
I'm so sorry.

04:10.041 --> 04:13.336
No. Something brought you
in here, something important.

04:13.419 --> 04:15.922
Yes, uh, but
it's complicated.

04:18.257 --> 04:20.885
Whatever it is, it's probably
better that you to come to us

04:20.969 --> 04:22.387
instead of wait
until we come and find you.

04:22.470 --> 04:26.432
I just... I-I just
don't want it to be true.

04:26.516 --> 04:28.893
You don't want what to be true?

04:30.561 --> 04:33.523
I think my girlfriend
is spying on me.

04:37.610 --> 04:40.029
Thank you.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.532
Her name's Rina Rollins.

04:42.615 --> 04:46.661
She's funny
and smart and driven.

04:47.662 --> 04:49.539
Yeah, she makes
me laugh.

04:49.622 --> 04:52.542
She's kind sometimes and other
times she's as tough as nails.

04:52.625 --> 04:54.419
From the moment we first met,
it was like

04:54.502 --> 04:55.878
we were meant for each other.

04:54.502 --> 04:55.878
That's great,

04:55.962 --> 04:57.213
but we need to know
a little bit more

04:57.296 --> 04:58.715
about why you think
she might be spying.

05:04.679 --> 05:06.639
I found these photos
on her laptop.

05:07.724 --> 05:10.393
What were you doing
on her laptop?

05:10.476 --> 05:12.854
MAX: I-I was trying
to take a look at her schedule.

05:12.937 --> 05:14.689
I was, uh...

05:14.772 --> 05:17.525
going to propose to her
and I wanted to make sure

05:17.608 --> 05:19.569
I picked a good evening
for us to go out.

05:22.113 --> 05:24.615
What's this a photo of?

05:24.699 --> 05:26.409
It's a page from the manual
for the room-temperature

05:26.492 --> 05:28.077
superconductor
we're both working on.

05:28.161 --> 05:31.873
Whoa.

05:28.161 --> 05:31.873
I'm guessing the super
thing has military value?

05:31.956 --> 05:33.207
Yeah, I mean, this-this
could pave the way

05:33.291 --> 05:35.209
for-for sustainable energy,

05:35.293 --> 05:36.961
artificial intelligence,
quantum computers.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.463
Right?
Magnetic levitation trains.

05:38.546 --> 05:42.884
I mean, if someone can
make this work, i-it'll be huge.

05:42.967 --> 05:44.969
Yeah.

05:42.967 --> 05:44.969
HANNAH: Well, if she has

05:45.053 --> 05:47.889
top secret clearance,
then what's the problem?

05:47.972 --> 05:49.140
She doesn't.

05:50.308 --> 05:52.101
Rina's tasked to develop
the emission system,

05:52.185 --> 05:54.437
which doesn't require
a clearance.

05:54.520 --> 05:58.232
I'm writing the manual for
the machine itself, which does.

05:58.316 --> 06:01.110
So then she got these images
from you?

06:02.653 --> 06:03.946
I-I know how
this looks.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.281
But there are
a lot of other ways

06:05.364 --> 06:06.574
she could have gotten
these photos.

06:06.657 --> 06:08.493
Maybe she borrowed
a flash drive or maybe

06:08.576 --> 06:11.162
I accidentally put them
on a cloud folder.

06:11.245 --> 06:13.498
Would you be that sloppy
with top secret information?

06:14.540 --> 06:15.583
Look,

06:15.666 --> 06:18.336
I have my regularly-scheduled
polygraph next week,

06:18.419 --> 06:21.506
and I don't want to fail it
because of my suspicions.

06:21.589 --> 06:23.800
I just want you
to prove Rina's clean so I can

06:23.883 --> 06:25.593
pass my test
and ask her

06:25.676 --> 06:27.678
to spend the rest
of her life with me.

06:33.768 --> 06:36.145
First comes love,
then comes polygraph.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.480
Those pictures
shouldn't be anywhere

06:37.563 --> 06:39.482
but on a secure system
or a laptop.

06:39.565 --> 06:41.651
But that isn't enough
to make a definitive judgement.

06:41.734 --> 06:44.487
If we got her computer, we could
put this to bed really quickly.

06:44.570 --> 06:46.030
PRIDE:
Yeah, if the girlfriend
is spying,

06:46.114 --> 06:48.574
we need to try
and get to her handlers.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.493
We should keep her in the dark
as long as possible.

06:50.576 --> 06:52.703
You know, we can't keep him if
he gets spooked and wants to go.

06:52.787 --> 06:54.789
You think he's gonna be able
to handle the pressure?

06:54.872 --> 06:56.791
(phone beeping)

06:54.872 --> 06:56.791
He loves her. It's hard to know.

06:56.874 --> 06:58.334
Ah.

06:58.417 --> 07:01.295
Okay, Patton
got a hit on Shorty.

07:01.379 --> 07:04.674
Real name is Charles Goggins.

07:04.757 --> 07:07.468
He lives in Mobile.

07:07.552 --> 07:09.679
Go ahead.

07:09.762 --> 07:11.013
We can handle this.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.224
Yeah.
I know you can.

07:13.307 --> 07:14.809
Thanks.
We, uh...

07:14.892 --> 07:17.103
(keys jingling)

07:17.186 --> 07:20.064
We need to have
Lasalle's back on this one.

07:23.734 --> 07:25.403
What's your gut saying?

07:25.486 --> 07:27.572
Well, they knew right away
they were perfect for each other

07:27.655 --> 07:29.615
because she researched
and crafted

07:29.699 --> 07:31.534
the perfect personality
to lure him in.

07:31.617 --> 07:33.035
That's cynical,
even for you.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.370
Yeah, because I've been there.

07:34.453 --> 07:35.997
My so very wrong for me
ex-husband

07:36.080 --> 07:38.207
didn't do anything he hadn't
perfectly planned first.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.042
This is gonna up the same way.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.377
Look, if anyone if there's
anyone who has reason to believe

07:41.460 --> 07:43.171
that the person they're dating
is holding

07:43.254 --> 07:45.715
some sort of terrible secret,
then it's me.

07:45.798 --> 07:46.716
Are you talking about

07:46.799 --> 07:48.676
your high school girlfriend
who unknowingly

07:48.759 --> 07:49.844
showed up in business
with your...

07:49.927 --> 07:52.180
No, no. He's talking about
the one who needed our help

07:52.263 --> 07:55.558
to find the pirate treasure
so she could steal it.

07:52.263 --> 07:55.558
I'm actually...

07:55.641 --> 07:57.768
I'm talking about the one who
turned out to be a British spy,

07:57.852 --> 07:58.728
but it's fine.
Whatever.

07:58.811 --> 08:00.563
The point is that this job--
I feel like

08:00.646 --> 08:04.025
sometimes it can just...
it can rob us of all hope

08:04.108 --> 08:05.067
and-and wonder

08:05.151 --> 08:06.527
and...

08:06.611 --> 08:08.070
you know.

08:08.154 --> 08:09.197
Yeah.

08:10.114 --> 08:11.240
Yeah.

08:11.324 --> 08:14.493
Okay, I change my mind.

08:14.577 --> 08:18.331
My gut instinct is I'm full
of hope and wonder.

08:22.501 --> 08:25.046
Okay, get with Patton,

08:25.129 --> 08:26.422
build a digital map
on Rina Rollins.

08:26.505 --> 08:27.924
See if it jives with what, uh,

08:28.007 --> 08:29.550
lover boy has to say about her.

08:29.634 --> 08:30.843
Okay.

08:33.888 --> 08:35.640
(chuckles softly)

08:38.643 --> 08:40.561
Chris, before we go in...

08:38.643 --> 08:40.561
I know.

08:40.645 --> 08:42.772
I know, all right? The main
concern is crafting a case

08:42.855 --> 08:45.983
that holds for Cade.
By the book.

08:46.067 --> 08:48.444
You're already investigating
your own brother's murder.

08:48.527 --> 08:50.279
We're way off-book.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.781
So I need to be sure...

08:51.864 --> 08:53.491
Pride, I can do this.

08:53.574 --> 08:54.867
All right?

08:54.951 --> 08:56.577
So let me.

08:59.914 --> 09:01.958
Okay.

09:02.041 --> 09:03.960
Once we clear a path
to the backyard,

09:04.043 --> 09:05.795
we should split up
to keep it covered.

09:05.878 --> 09:07.463
I'll take the front.

09:16.639 --> 09:18.641
(sizzling)

09:18.724 --> 09:21.477
What do you think you're
doing in my backyard?

09:21.560 --> 09:22.645
I'm NCIS.

09:22.728 --> 09:24.647
Special Agent
Christopher Lasalle.

09:24.730 --> 09:27.316
NCIS?
What the heck is that?

09:27.400 --> 09:29.193
Are you Charles Goggins?

09:29.277 --> 09:30.945
You probably already know that.

09:31.028 --> 09:32.446
Are you alone?

09:35.574 --> 09:36.325
Why would you ask that?

09:35.574 --> 09:36.325
'Cause you

09:36.409 --> 09:38.577
sound like you're from
some fake agency

09:38.661 --> 09:41.455
and you look like you're
some kind of scam artist.

09:41.539 --> 09:43.207
I'm here on
a homicide investigation.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.710
Does the name Cade Lasalle
ring a bell?

09:45.793 --> 09:48.129
He would have come to you
trying to get a kid

09:48.212 --> 09:51.048
named Will out of your racket.

09:53.050 --> 09:54.719
Pride, he's rabbiting!

09:56.304 --> 09:58.180
Did you kill my brother? Huh?

09:56.304 --> 09:58.180
No! No! I...

10:00.599 --> 10:02.143
Did you kill my brother?!

10:00.599 --> 10:02.143
I didn't kill anybody.

10:02.226 --> 10:04.145
Huh? Tell me! Tell me about it!

10:02.226 --> 10:04.145
PRIDE:
Chris, hey!

10:04.228 --> 10:06.647
Did you kill him? Tell me
what you know about Cade!

10:04.228 --> 10:06.647
Chris. Chris.

10:06.731 --> 10:08.190
He's not resisting. Chris.

10:08.274 --> 10:09.525
What'd you do to Cade?

10:08.274 --> 10:09.525
Please.

10:09.608 --> 10:12.445
Not in front of my little girl.

10:09.608 --> 10:12.445
Huh? Why you...

10:16.782 --> 10:18.492
We need him to talk to us.

10:18.576 --> 10:20.202
All right, get off him
so he can talk.

10:20.286 --> 10:21.704
Tell him you'll talk, Charles.

10:20.286 --> 10:21.704
I will.

10:21.787 --> 10:24.206
I will.

10:21.787 --> 10:24.206
Come on.

10:24.290 --> 10:25.791
Get up, get up.

10:39.930 --> 10:42.016
I didn't kill
your brother.

10:42.099 --> 10:43.476
I told you.

10:44.935 --> 10:46.020
All right.

10:47.688 --> 10:49.732
I wasn't listening earlier.

10:51.859 --> 10:53.652
I'm listening now.

10:55.071 --> 10:58.574
Why don't you start
when Cade first contacted you.

10:58.657 --> 10:59.950
He found me.

11:00.034 --> 11:01.869
Said that kid
pointed me out.

11:01.952 --> 11:02.912
Will?

11:02.995 --> 11:05.414
I guess. Look,

11:05.498 --> 11:08.250
these kids who get involved with
me, they mostly don't have dads.

11:08.334 --> 11:10.378
They come to me to make
a couple of bucks

11:10.461 --> 11:12.254
so they feel like
they're helping out at home.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.715
They don't ask me questions,
I don't ask them questions.

11:14.799 --> 11:15.716
Look, I don't
care about

11:15.800 --> 11:16.926
your drug operation.

11:17.009 --> 11:18.052
Tell me about Cade.

11:18.135 --> 11:21.389
He wanted to get Will
out of this thing.

11:21.472 --> 11:22.807
Said he was willing to pay
to get it done.

11:22.890 --> 11:25.142
Pay?

11:22.890 --> 11:25.142
To make good.

11:25.226 --> 11:27.853
Will lost a package.
That's not okay.

11:27.937 --> 11:29.980
A package isn't worth
a man's life.

11:30.064 --> 11:31.607
So, Cade

11:31.690 --> 11:33.776
came to you.

11:33.859 --> 11:34.944
What'd you do?

11:35.027 --> 11:37.446
I gave him a phone.
What else could I do?

11:37.530 --> 11:39.615
He said he was gonna involve
some federal agent.

11:39.698 --> 11:41.283
Me.

11:42.535 --> 11:45.246
I'm that federal agent.

11:45.329 --> 11:48.457
So you thought it'd be better to
leave law enforcement out of it?

11:48.541 --> 11:50.000
For sure.
If he could work it out

11:50.084 --> 11:52.628
with the bosses and everybody
walked away happy,

11:52.711 --> 11:54.171
I saw that as a happy ending.

11:54.255 --> 11:56.674
Instead, you got a man killed.

11:54.255 --> 11:56.674
Not the way I see it.

11:56.757 --> 11:58.759
Way I see it,
he got himself killed.

11:59.885 --> 12:03.764
So you're just
the phone guy.

12:03.848 --> 12:06.600
You get batches of phones,
and you gave one to Cade.

12:06.684 --> 12:08.644
That's it, man.

12:08.727 --> 12:10.813
That's all.

12:10.896 --> 12:12.148
PRIDE:
So was the phone

12:12.231 --> 12:14.400
that you gave him
out of this batch?

12:19.029 --> 12:20.948
PATTON:
<i>Rina Rollins.</i>

12:21.031 --> 12:22.992
More sexy librarian
than red sparrow.

12:23.075 --> 12:24.869
SEBASTIAN:
Yeah, she's got a doctorate
in energy systems

12:24.952 --> 12:26.454
and climate change,
and during her studies,

12:26.537 --> 12:29.206
she volunteered in Africa
working with an NGO to install

12:29.290 --> 12:31.500
solar water
purification systems.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.669
So, in short,
she's totally cool

12:33.752 --> 12:35.546
and doesn't sound nefarious
in any way.

12:35.629 --> 12:37.465
Well, the water project
was in Uganda,

12:37.548 --> 12:39.467
which has ties
to the Russian regime.

12:39.550 --> 12:41.010
And if she did spend
all those years

12:41.093 --> 12:42.928
getting a doctorate
in climate change,

12:43.012 --> 12:44.346
she probably
isn't too pleased

12:44.430 --> 12:45.890
that our government
isn't doing much about it.

12:45.973 --> 12:47.850
Not to mention all the
applications Sebastian told us

12:47.933 --> 12:49.143
the machine is capable of.

12:49.226 --> 12:50.352
I mean, it's worth
hundreds of millions,

12:50.436 --> 12:53.314
if not billions, it's good
enough reasons to dupe a guy.

12:53.397 --> 12:55.858
Yeah, way to go with the hope
and wonder there, guys.

12:55.941 --> 12:56.692
HANNAH:
Patton, did you get
everything you could

12:56.775 --> 12:58.402
from her car and her phone?

12:56.775 --> 12:58.402
Yeah.

12:58.486 --> 12:59.487
HANNAH:
Okay, well, then,

12:59.570 --> 13:01.739
you guys know what to do.

13:05.117 --> 13:07.369
We accessed Rina's
phone and car records

13:07.453 --> 13:10.331
to put together a digital map
of Rina's movements.

13:10.414 --> 13:12.208
Movements?

13:12.291 --> 13:15.544
That seems illegal
and incredibly intrusive.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.213
Well, she signed
a Navy contract

13:17.296 --> 13:18.839
to work on sensitive
information,

13:18.923 --> 13:19.965
and that includes
giving us permission

13:20.049 --> 13:21.217
to scrutinize
things like this.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.677
Well, yeah, but we don't know
that she did anything wrong.

13:23.761 --> 13:25.679
Look, I get that you're
being protective, okay?

13:25.763 --> 13:28.224
It's just we... I mean,
we got to run this down.

13:28.307 --> 13:29.558
I shouldn't have
come to you guys.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.435
What-what if I-if I just
talk to her?

13:31.519 --> 13:32.937
It's too late for that.

13:33.020 --> 13:33.979
If you leave now,

13:34.063 --> 13:35.856
we'll have no choice
but to go to her directly.

13:35.940 --> 13:36.815
She'll never forgive me.

13:36.899 --> 13:38.901
Then let's hope the pictures
on her computer

13:38.984 --> 13:40.736
are nothing to be worried about.

13:40.819 --> 13:43.572
What does she tell you
she does after work?

13:43.656 --> 13:44.949
What do you mean, "tell me"?

13:45.032 --> 13:46.283
You're treating this
like she's already guilty.

13:50.996 --> 13:53.040
After work, she goes to the gym,

13:53.123 --> 13:55.125
and if it's a night we're
spending together, which is

13:55.209 --> 13:58.921
most nights, we take turns going
shopping and making dinner.

13:59.004 --> 14:01.924
How many nights do you guys
spend together versus apart?

14:02.007 --> 14:04.760
We are together every night.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.305
Except for the
Thursday exception.

14:08.389 --> 14:10.224
What's that?

14:10.307 --> 14:11.600
When we started to get serious,

14:11.684 --> 14:14.103
she suggested we carve out
Thursdays as a day

14:14.186 --> 14:16.230
where we can spend time alone

14:16.313 --> 14:17.940
or separately
with friends.

14:18.023 --> 14:20.901
I mean, three weeks out of four,
we just end up together anyway.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.778
So, wait, on a monthly basis,

14:22.861 --> 14:25.739
she has a night where you're
not allowed to question her?

14:25.823 --> 14:27.116
I-I'm allowed.

14:27.199 --> 14:28.742
Do you?

14:27.199 --> 14:28.742
I wanted her to feel

14:28.826 --> 14:30.786
like I trusted her.

14:28.826 --> 14:30.786
Max.

14:30.869 --> 14:32.454
Today is Thursday.

14:32.538 --> 14:34.623
What is she doing after work?

14:34.707 --> 14:37.876
There's no backing out
now, Lieutenant.

14:40.129 --> 14:42.548
She's meeting some friends

14:42.631 --> 14:45.843
in the Quarter
for an early dinner.

14:52.224 --> 14:54.768
Chris, you said
that you were okay...

14:54.852 --> 14:57.813
and you weren't.

14:54.852 --> 14:57.813
I know. And I'm sorry.

14:57.896 --> 14:59.648
You're lucky
he tried to run.

14:59.732 --> 15:00.858
Otherwise, we might've...

15:00.941 --> 15:04.320
Compromised the case.
Look, I get it.

15:04.403 --> 15:05.863
No, let me finish, Christopher,

15:05.946 --> 15:08.949
because we played it your way,
and we almost got burned.

15:09.033 --> 15:12.119
We need to focus
on getting justice,

15:12.202 --> 15:13.912
which means no mistakes.

15:25.966 --> 15:28.636
Are you two okay?

15:28.719 --> 15:31.013
We're fine, Miss Rose.

15:31.096 --> 15:32.389
Pride's pointing out
the fact

15:32.473 --> 15:36.018
that I'm not being as
professional as he'd like.

15:36.101 --> 15:38.687
Of course you're not.
You lost your brother.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.898
(cell phone buzzing)

15:38.771 --> 15:40.898
And it hasn't been that long

15:40.981 --> 15:42.983
since we lost
your father.

15:43.067 --> 15:45.694
Sorry, I need to...
I need to check in.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.529
Excuse me.

15:49.073 --> 15:51.367
Long as Dwayne's known you,

15:51.450 --> 15:53.869
I would think he'd have
figured out the quickest way

15:53.952 --> 15:55.371
to upset a Lasalle

15:55.454 --> 15:57.873
is to hint he might not
be up to a task,

15:57.956 --> 15:59.375
isn't that right?

15:59.458 --> 16:02.378
But you know that's
not what he's saying.

16:02.461 --> 16:05.798
He cares about you.
We all do.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.050
I know it.

16:09.510 --> 16:11.053
I know he's right, too.

16:13.681 --> 16:15.766
I let my anger
take over today.

16:17.267 --> 16:20.896
But something else
is bothering me.

16:20.979 --> 16:22.898
What's bothering you, Chris?

16:22.981 --> 16:26.485
Cade had a whole life going.

16:26.568 --> 16:29.613
Something real.

16:29.697 --> 16:31.782
Kelly, his girlfriend.

16:31.865 --> 16:33.742
Her son, Will.

16:35.786 --> 16:37.079
I didn't even know him.

16:38.664 --> 16:41.083
That's because
he reached out to you

16:41.166 --> 16:44.086
from a place of trouble
so many times.

16:44.169 --> 16:47.589
He wanted to take care
of what was going on himself,

16:47.673 --> 16:49.591
and prove to you
how much he had changed.

16:50.884 --> 16:52.761
You understand that?

16:53.971 --> 16:55.389
I'm trying.

16:58.892 --> 17:01.937
Patton got a hit
on Goggins' phone guy.

17:03.689 --> 17:04.773
Sorry, Miss Rose.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.108
It's all right.

17:06.191 --> 17:07.651
Go find out who killed my boy,

17:08.569 --> 17:09.945
So we can get busy

17:10.028 --> 17:12.489
healing the family
we've got left.

17:28.547 --> 17:30.966
This is the best
Patton could do?

17:31.049 --> 17:32.968
(tablet clatters)

17:33.051 --> 17:34.887
He got us a match

17:34.970 --> 17:37.514
to the location where
the cell phones were bought.

17:37.598 --> 17:40.642
Not his fault the store
has old security cameras.

17:42.102 --> 17:43.771
It's just...

17:43.854 --> 17:47.316
if we don't find this dude
who bought the phones,

17:47.399 --> 17:49.860
how's he gonna lead us
to whoever Cade talked to?

17:49.943 --> 17:51.612
We're not gonna
give up, Chris.

17:51.695 --> 17:54.656
No matter what this guy
does or doesn't tell us.

17:58.535 --> 18:00.788
I messed up.

18:00.871 --> 18:02.122
Big-time.

18:03.957 --> 18:05.793
I take your feedback to heart,

18:05.876 --> 18:07.795
and...

18:07.878 --> 18:09.505
I want you to know that.

18:11.256 --> 18:12.925
What happened earlier today...

18:15.260 --> 18:17.304
...it won't happen again.

18:20.057 --> 18:22.184
Thank you...

18:22.267 --> 18:24.269
for having my back.

18:28.565 --> 18:30.567
Always.

18:35.906 --> 18:37.658
I spent years

18:37.741 --> 18:40.410
thinking about my dad,

18:40.494 --> 18:43.163
all the ways
he failed me.

18:43.247 --> 18:47.334
But to make my life work,

18:47.417 --> 18:51.171
I had to figure out a way
to forgive him some things

18:51.255 --> 18:53.924
and make peace
with the rest of it.

18:54.007 --> 18:55.717
And the truth is,

18:55.801 --> 18:58.679
who he was

18:58.762 --> 19:01.098
made me who I am.

19:05.644 --> 19:08.814
All those miles
you and Cade walked together

19:08.897 --> 19:10.774
helped form him.

19:10.858 --> 19:12.609
Made it possible
for him

19:12.693 --> 19:16.029
to make a life for himself,
despite real challenges.

19:19.491 --> 19:21.201
(bell jingles)

19:25.831 --> 19:28.876
Well, maybe this isn't
such a bad photo after all.

19:42.347 --> 19:43.265
Excuse me.

19:43.348 --> 19:45.350
NCIS, Special A...

19:51.023 --> 19:52.858
(bus honks)

19:55.027 --> 19:57.321
(siren wailing)

20:00.866 --> 20:03.577
(car horns honking)

20:21.720 --> 20:22.971
Crap!

20:28.894 --> 20:30.938
We got lucky, and...

20:31.021 --> 20:32.648
then he got lucky.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.650
I was so close.

20:34.733 --> 20:36.985
Well...

20:37.069 --> 20:38.528
at least he left behind
what let's hope is

20:38.612 --> 20:41.823
a key piece of evidence.

20:41.907 --> 20:43.325
Huh?

20:43.408 --> 20:45.702
Come on, let's get it back
to Sebastian immediately.

20:45.786 --> 20:48.830
(panting)

20:48.914 --> 20:50.165
♪ ♪

20:52.793 --> 20:55.170
(indistinct conversations)

20:55.253 --> 20:57.422
I just... I don't think that
spies have that many friends.

20:57.506 --> 20:59.716
Sure they do.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.551
But they don't
enjoy them like that.

21:01.635 --> 21:03.679
This whole
"hope and wonder" thing--

21:03.762 --> 21:06.682
what's it all about?

21:03.762 --> 21:06.682
Huh? Oh. Yeah, I... You know.

21:06.765 --> 21:09.685
It's just... I'm in my 30s,

21:09.768 --> 21:11.353
living with my best friend.
Which is great.

21:11.436 --> 21:12.562
It's great.

21:11.436 --> 21:12.562
It's totally great.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.149
But?

21:16.233 --> 21:17.526
But, you know,

21:17.609 --> 21:19.695
I think I want more, eventually.

21:19.778 --> 21:20.779
I guess. I don't know.
I don't want to be

21:20.862 --> 21:23.198
a-a grumpy old man
living with a grumpy old woman.

21:24.157 --> 21:25.283
What?

21:25.367 --> 21:26.159
You're a grumpy
young woman,

21:26.243 --> 21:27.369
you're gonna be
a grumpy old woman.

21:27.452 --> 21:28.912
You can't deny that.

21:27.452 --> 21:28.912
You're rude.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.206
I'm sorry.

21:34.918 --> 21:37.337
So you want to believe that
there's a true love story here

21:37.421 --> 21:40.048
so that there's still
a true love story ahead for you?

21:37.421 --> 21:40.048
Yes.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.508
Exactly. Is that
so wrong?

21:40.132 --> 21:41.508
Okay. No.

21:41.591 --> 21:43.051
You know, can't a guy
root for a happy ending?

21:43.135 --> 21:44.553
Sure. It's fine.

21:44.636 --> 21:46.888
All right. Thank you.
I appreciate that.

21:46.972 --> 21:49.349
Even though she's walking
in the opposite direction

21:49.433 --> 21:51.309
of her car right now.

21:49.433 --> 21:51.309
What...

21:51.393 --> 21:52.686
Damn it.

21:52.769 --> 21:54.021
I'll go on foot.

21:52.769 --> 21:54.021
All right.

21:54.104 --> 21:55.564
I'll get ahead of her
in the car.

21:55.647 --> 21:57.024
(engine starts)

22:10.829 --> 22:12.581
GREGORIO:
She just got in

22:12.664 --> 22:14.416
a red and white pedicab
heading your way.

22:14.499 --> 22:15.751
SEBASTIAN (over comms):
Okay, I'm on it.

22:16.793 --> 22:18.628
She just made a drop.
I'm moving in.

22:18.712 --> 22:19.755
Hey! Rina Rollins!

22:19.838 --> 22:22.758
Federal Agent!
Hands up!

22:25.552 --> 22:27.929
Get down.

22:25.552 --> 22:27.929
You're making a mistake.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.014
GREGORIO:
Oh, yeah?

22:29.097 --> 22:30.974
Well, whatever you were trying
to pass off on this

22:31.058 --> 22:32.434
was the mistake.

22:34.644 --> 22:36.605
Sorry that took so long.

22:36.688 --> 22:38.732
I was busy arresting
a suspected spy.

22:38.815 --> 22:41.109
So the boyfriend was right
to be suspicious?

22:41.193 --> 22:42.611
Oh, yeah,
photos from the manual,

22:42.694 --> 22:46.031
secret drop, hidden flash drive,
it's not looking good.

22:46.114 --> 22:47.240
All right, well,
thanks for coming.

22:46.114 --> 22:47.240
Yeah.

22:47.324 --> 22:51.661
We got this backpack off the
main suspect in Lasalle's case.

22:51.745 --> 22:54.748
Okay. Well, let's hope it's not
just filled with homework.

22:54.831 --> 22:55.832
(chuckles)

22:56.750 --> 22:59.419
Oh. What is that?

22:59.503 --> 23:00.629
Sebastian,

23:00.712 --> 23:02.089
could fentanyl
be in the bag?

23:02.172 --> 23:04.091
I don't know, it c...

23:04.174 --> 23:06.593
Hey, hey!
Get me a Narcan shot now.

23:06.676 --> 23:08.595
Go!

23:06.676 --> 23:08.595
Hold on, Sebastian, hold on.

23:18.897 --> 23:21.483
Are you sure
you're okay?

23:21.566 --> 23:24.528
Yeah, it wasn't, like, a-a
head injury kind of fainting.

23:24.611 --> 23:27.697
No, a mere overdose
kind of fainting

23:27.781 --> 23:29.449
from fentanyl-laced
stickers.

23:29.533 --> 23:33.161
I'm fine. Really. I am.
I-I want to help Lasalle.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.330
I can do that all
from a-a seated position

23:35.413 --> 23:37.541
Look, I'm glad
my team is gung ho,

23:37.624 --> 23:39.459
but I think I need
to have a talk

23:39.543 --> 23:42.170
with all of you about self-care.

23:42.254 --> 23:43.839
Yeah, that'll go well.

23:46.133 --> 23:48.343
Little pot calling
the kettle black?

23:48.426 --> 23:51.388
Feel like that's
a trick question.

23:51.471 --> 23:53.306
Looks like
Wade was right.

23:53.390 --> 23:57.394
The stickers are a transdermal
system for synthetic opioids.

23:57.477 --> 24:00.355
So getting high
has never been easier.

24:00.438 --> 24:02.190
I ran a search
on the stickers.

24:02.274 --> 24:04.192
Found reports
of overdoses

24:04.276 --> 24:07.279
all along the Gulf Coast
going back months.

24:08.363 --> 24:10.699
Oh, here we go.

24:10.782 --> 24:12.534
'Cause this is a synthetic
opioid, I thought that maybe it,

24:12.617 --> 24:14.995
uh, came from somewhere else,
and looks like I was right.

24:15.078 --> 24:17.706
The molecular analysis
matches a drug baseline

24:17.789 --> 24:18.999
for a patent application.

24:19.082 --> 24:21.042
PRIDE:
From a lab in Alabama.

24:21.126 --> 24:22.043
That can't be
a coincidence.

24:22.127 --> 24:23.545
They were patenting

24:23.628 --> 24:26.882
a less addictive
synthetic opioid?

24:26.965 --> 24:29.259
Yeah. Identifying what
made it less addictive

24:29.342 --> 24:31.386
allowed the network
to adjust the formula

24:31.469 --> 24:34.055
for their synthetic fentanyl,
make it more addictive.

24:34.139 --> 24:37.058
And deadly.
Ruining lives for profit.

24:37.142 --> 24:39.227
And it looks like Cade
got in the way.

24:39.311 --> 24:41.229
Send me the details
on the patent.

24:41.313 --> 24:43.857
I'll drop by the lab
on my way back to Alabama.

24:43.940 --> 24:47.360
See if they've got any idea
who stole their formula.

24:47.444 --> 24:49.070
RINA:
<i>I want to</i>

24:49.154 --> 24:50.822
talk to Max,
please.

24:50.906 --> 24:52.240
I can't let it end like this.

24:50.906 --> 24:52.240
Oh, honey,

24:52.324 --> 24:53.241
this is just
the beginning for you.

24:53.325 --> 24:55.410
You need to talk to us
before you talk to Max.

24:55.493 --> 24:57.037
That's if he wants
to talk to you at all.

24:57.120 --> 24:58.747
He'll never forgive me.

24:57.120 --> 24:58.747
Why should he?

24:58.830 --> 25:01.583
You used him.

24:58.830 --> 25:01.583
That's not what happened.

25:01.666 --> 25:03.710
Please, I need to talk to him.

25:03.793 --> 25:06.254
And we need to know
who told you to target Max,

25:06.338 --> 25:07.797
who you were
leaving the USB for,

25:07.881 --> 25:09.424
and how much damage
you've already done

25:09.507 --> 25:11.593
to the superconductor project.

25:11.676 --> 25:14.095
Look, I was spying,

25:14.179 --> 25:15.847
but I was forced to.

25:15.931 --> 25:18.099
And my relationship
with Max is real.

25:18.183 --> 25:21.186
I was never told to target him.
He was a surprise.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.898
Okay.

25:24.981 --> 25:26.524
We're listening.

25:28.652 --> 25:31.613
I went to Uganda
for my doctoral thesis,

25:31.696 --> 25:33.448
a water purification system.

25:33.531 --> 25:35.408
Yeah, we know that.

25:35.492 --> 25:37.619
I was approached by this guy.

25:37.702 --> 25:39.913
He said he worked for a NGO.

25:39.996 --> 25:41.414
He was upset that
the company I was

25:41.498 --> 25:42.749
working with was keeping
their patent secret,

25:42.832 --> 25:45.460
just because they wanted
to make more money.

25:45.543 --> 25:46.503
I mean, we were in

25:46.586 --> 25:49.130
a part of the world
where people are suffering.

25:49.214 --> 25:51.675
Probably bought you a few
drinks, had so much in common.

25:51.758 --> 25:53.301
Said all the things
you wanted to hear.

25:53.385 --> 25:54.302
He made a lot of sense.

25:54.386 --> 25:57.764
Made me feel like I'd be
a hero if I helped him.

25:57.847 --> 26:00.976
He just wanted a peek
at the engineering plans.

26:01.059 --> 26:03.311
And so you committed
industrial espionage.

26:03.395 --> 26:04.396
HANNAH:
And as soon as you helped,

26:04.479 --> 26:06.523
the guy who seemed normal
turned out to be working

26:06.606 --> 26:08.984
for a foreign government.

26:06.606 --> 26:08.984
I'm gonna guess Russia.

26:09.067 --> 26:11.820
And threatened to turn you in if
you didn't pull another mission.

26:11.903 --> 26:14.322
You make it sound like...

26:11.903 --> 26:14.322
It happens all the time.

26:14.406 --> 26:15.824
It does.

26:15.907 --> 26:17.284
And then you took
what he did to you

26:17.367 --> 26:19.327
and you did it to Max.
It's not that complicated.

26:19.411 --> 26:22.747
The Russians forced me
to apply for this Navy contract.

26:22.831 --> 26:23.999
I got the job.

26:24.082 --> 26:25.750
I didn't want to spy,

26:25.834 --> 26:28.503
but I was scared of spending
the rest of my life in prison.

26:28.586 --> 26:29.504
You were scared?

26:29.587 --> 26:31.673
You weren't scared enough
to turn yourself in

26:31.756 --> 26:33.675
and work this out, right?

26:33.758 --> 26:35.510
I thought about it.

26:36.428 --> 26:37.887
But then I met Max,

26:37.971 --> 26:40.557
and it was like we were
made for each other.

26:40.640 --> 26:43.143
And then I had
even more to lose.

26:46.896 --> 26:48.648
It's a nice story,

26:48.732 --> 26:50.525
but we have a USB
filled with

26:50.608 --> 26:54.029
classified information that you
passed along to your handlers.

26:54.112 --> 26:55.071
Not exactly.

26:55.155 --> 26:58.366
I manipulated the images,
fed them false intel.

26:58.450 --> 27:01.161
Max's machine is safe.

27:02.662 --> 27:04.998
You tricked the Russians.

27:05.081 --> 27:07.459
Just trying to buy time.

27:07.542 --> 27:10.378
Figure out how to get out
from underneath their thumb,

27:10.462 --> 27:12.380
but then time ran out.

27:13.965 --> 27:16.384
Please...

27:16.468 --> 27:19.387
let Max know how sorry I am.

27:22.849 --> 27:23.892
Okay.

27:23.975 --> 27:27.562
I want you to write down
everything you can remember,

27:27.645 --> 27:29.564
including the name
of all your handlers

27:29.647 --> 27:31.316
and how you contacted them.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.532
What's your gut
telling you now?

27:39.616 --> 27:41.242
She's a highly
intelligent woman

27:41.326 --> 27:43.578
who just admitted to doing
a string of dumb stuff.

27:43.661 --> 27:45.246
That doesn't mean
she isn't telling the truth.

27:45.330 --> 27:46.206
Doesn't mean she is either.

27:46.289 --> 27:48.583
Okay, fair enough.

27:48.666 --> 27:51.211
I'm thoroughly confused myself
at this point.

27:51.294 --> 27:53.046
The only thing we're sure of
is the USB.

27:53.129 --> 27:54.255
I'll run it up the flagpole

27:54.339 --> 27:56.091
in case the project
has been compromised.

27:54.339 --> 27:56.091
All right,

27:56.174 --> 27:57.759
I'll bring it to Patton
to analyze what's on the drive.

27:57.842 --> 28:00.387
Okay.

28:09.229 --> 28:10.730
ROSE:
Morning.

28:10.814 --> 28:12.565
Oh, didn't mean to startle you.

28:14.359 --> 28:15.276
I'm, uh...

28:15.360 --> 28:17.112
A thousand miles away?

28:17.195 --> 28:19.406
More like a thousand years.

28:19.489 --> 28:22.117
Ah. Lost in memories.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.284
I know the feeling.

28:23.368 --> 28:26.287
I'd say a cup of coffee will
bring you back to the present,

28:26.371 --> 28:27.747
but you don't indulge.

28:30.667 --> 28:33.294
I know it's hard, sweetheart.

28:33.378 --> 28:36.506
Harder than I thought
it would be.

28:36.589 --> 28:38.508
When this is over,

28:38.591 --> 28:40.301
come back home

28:40.385 --> 28:43.847
and we'll honor him properly.

28:43.930 --> 28:44.848
Neither of us

28:44.931 --> 28:46.975
should go through this alone.

28:48.393 --> 28:50.270
PRIDE:
Hey there. Let myself in.

28:50.353 --> 28:53.314
Miss Rose, you mind if I borrow
Christopher for a minute?

28:53.398 --> 28:54.524
Please.
(chuckles)

28:54.607 --> 28:56.943
I hope you had breakfast already
'cause we got work to do.

28:57.026 --> 28:58.778
You run down the patent holder
on the fentanyl

28:58.862 --> 29:00.155
from the backpack?

28:58.862 --> 29:00.155
I did.

29:00.238 --> 29:02.282
Dropped in on Dr. Francie Neary

29:02.365 --> 29:04.117
early this morning
on my way here.

29:04.200 --> 29:05.785
She was very forthcoming

29:05.869 --> 29:07.245
once I told her
her patent was being used

29:07.328 --> 29:09.289
to deal illegal narcotics.

29:09.372 --> 29:11.666
She have an idea
who stole the patent?

29:09.372 --> 29:11.666
She had someone

29:11.749 --> 29:13.668
who came to mind immediately--

29:13.751 --> 29:17.088
a disgruntled lab assistant
who'd been fired for negligence.

29:17.172 --> 29:18.423
You get a name?

29:18.506 --> 29:20.633
Name, address, phone number,

29:20.717 --> 29:22.177
social security,
license plate number,

29:22.260 --> 29:25.221
and a picture of Stan Jenkins.

29:25.305 --> 29:27.182
Let's go get him.

29:30.059 --> 29:32.187
Hey.

29:32.270 --> 29:35.023
Good you're all here.
We got a major problem.

29:35.106 --> 29:36.107
Dude, you're not
supposed to let

29:36.191 --> 29:38.568
people in custody out.

29:36.191 --> 29:38.568
I think she needs to see this.

29:38.651 --> 29:40.987
I mirrored Rina's
smartphone to monitor

29:41.070 --> 29:43.573
incoming communication,
and she just got this.

29:46.326 --> 29:47.952
Oh, no.

29:48.036 --> 29:49.037
MAN: Rina,

29:49.120 --> 29:52.540
you've been a naughty girl.
When you signaled a drop

29:52.624 --> 29:55.251
and there wasn't anything there,
we took a closer look

29:55.335 --> 29:56.711
at the information
you've been passing us. Shh.

29:56.794 --> 30:00.256
(muffled shouting)

30:00.340 --> 30:02.550
We want all the real,
undoctored information

30:02.634 --> 30:04.761
by this afternoon,

30:04.844 --> 30:08.181
and I think the "or else"

30:08.264 --> 30:11.643
is pretty obvious.

30:24.364 --> 30:25.532
I knew it was just
a matter of time

30:25.615 --> 30:28.576
before my handlers found out
I was passing bad information.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.119
Did you think they
were gonna do this?

30:30.203 --> 30:32.455
No. I thought
they'd take it out on me.

30:32.539 --> 30:34.207
They probably would've
if I wasn't here.

30:34.290 --> 30:36.084
There is good news here.

30:34.290 --> 30:36.084
What?

30:36.167 --> 30:37.252
They don't know about us.
I don't think

30:37.335 --> 30:38.586
they knew you were picked up.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.046
Well, then we got to set
a meeting immediately,

30:40.129 --> 30:41.089
before they figure out
that we got her.

30:41.172 --> 30:42.840
I love Max.

30:43.675 --> 30:44.926
Trade me for him.

30:45.009 --> 30:46.761
That is not how this works.

30:46.844 --> 30:49.389
We can't just turn over
somebody in our custody

30:49.472 --> 30:50.932
to be murdered by the Russians.

30:51.015 --> 30:51.933
RINA:
I don't care

30:52.016 --> 30:53.142
what happens to me.

30:53.226 --> 30:54.561
Max is the good guy here.

30:54.644 --> 30:56.479
Save him.

30:57.522 --> 30:59.607
The superconductor needs him.

30:59.691 --> 31:01.109
GREGORIO:
We can do this, Hannah.

31:01.192 --> 31:02.110
We know who we're looking for.

31:02.193 --> 31:03.903
They don't know we're looking.

31:05.321 --> 31:06.781
Please.

31:06.864 --> 31:08.491
(exhales)
Okay.

31:08.575 --> 31:09.492
I'll double-check
with Pride.

31:09.576 --> 31:11.452
But you have to do

31:11.536 --> 31:13.746
exactly what we say.

31:16.874 --> 31:19.294
PRIDE:
We followed Stan Jenkins
to that warehouse.

31:19.377 --> 31:21.254
He entered roughly
20 minutes ago.

31:21.337 --> 31:23.089
LASALLE:
Clearly, the suspect
we tried to apprehend

31:23.172 --> 31:25.091
outside the
convenience store

31:25.174 --> 31:26.426
let them know
we were on their trail.

31:26.509 --> 31:27.802
They knew the moment
we found the stickers

31:27.885 --> 31:29.596
in his backpack,

31:29.679 --> 31:32.015
it would just be a matter
of time before we found the lab.

31:32.098 --> 31:34.809
So we're talking possible
flammable materials inside,

31:34.892 --> 31:36.477
and suspects who may
have killed before?

31:34.892 --> 31:36.477
Correct.

31:36.561 --> 31:39.022
We got it.

31:36.561 --> 31:39.022
And there's one more thing.

31:39.105 --> 31:40.690
We need Jenkins alive.

31:40.773 --> 31:42.984
He has critical information
about my brother's murder.

31:43.067 --> 31:45.486
We have questions
only he can answer.

31:45.570 --> 31:46.571
I'll show the guys.

31:59.083 --> 32:00.960
Federal agents!
Get your hands up!

32:02.587 --> 32:04.505
Drop it!

32:04.589 --> 32:06.841
Easy. Hands on the truck.

32:14.223 --> 32:16.976
Jenkins!

32:18.936 --> 32:21.147
Jenkins! Come out
with your hands up!

32:21.230 --> 32:22.815
We got you surrounded!

32:24.233 --> 32:25.318
Put it down!

32:25.401 --> 32:27.153
Drop your weapon!

32:25.401 --> 32:27.153
No.

32:29.155 --> 32:30.990
No! No!

32:33.618 --> 32:35.870
Hold your fire! Federal agent!

32:37.080 --> 32:38.331
Jenkins!

32:38.414 --> 32:40.958
No. Jenkins.

32:41.042 --> 32:42.543
Come on, Jenkins.

32:42.627 --> 32:44.420
Who killed my brother?
Who killed Cade?

32:44.504 --> 32:45.713
He's gone.

32:44.504 --> 32:45.713
Jenkins!

32:45.797 --> 32:47.757
Chris, he's...

32:47.840 --> 32:49.967
he's gone.

32:55.807 --> 32:58.059
GREGORIO:
<i>Play it one more time.</i>

32:58.142 --> 33:01.479
MAN: At exactly 11:48, you will
get on the first elevator

33:01.562 --> 33:03.940
and press the button
for the top floor.

33:04.023 --> 33:06.192
We will handle
everything from there.

33:06.275 --> 33:08.111
RINA:
Yes, sir. Can you tell Ma...

33:08.194 --> 33:09.237
SEBASTIAN:
W-What's so special

33:09.320 --> 33:10.613
about the first elevator?

33:09.320 --> 33:10.613
Nothing.

33:10.697 --> 33:12.198
They just want to know
exactly where she is

33:12.281 --> 33:13.408
so they can meet her
on any floor they choose.

33:13.491 --> 33:15.034
Right. And an
elevator's contained,

33:15.118 --> 33:16.661
so it can't be watched
from the outside.

33:16.744 --> 33:18.871
Guys, involving Rina's
too dangerous.

33:18.955 --> 33:21.958
I don't care.

33:18.955 --> 33:21.958
Pride and I think
it's our best option.

33:22.041 --> 33:23.209
NOPD's gonna help us

33:23.292 --> 33:25.420
with surveillance inside
the hotel itself.

33:25.503 --> 33:26.921
This can go bad
in a lot of ways.

33:27.004 --> 33:28.881
If it does,

33:28.965 --> 33:31.008
can you tell Max
everything that I said?

33:31.092 --> 33:32.218
That I would've

33:32.301 --> 33:34.137
said yes when he asked me?

33:35.513 --> 33:37.932
We're gonna let you
tell him yourself.

33:51.529 --> 33:52.780
♪ ♪

34:12.550 --> 34:14.510
I'm so sorry.

34:15.553 --> 34:17.472
Please, don't do this.

34:17.555 --> 34:18.848
MAN:
It's too late.

34:22.018 --> 34:24.687
I'm sorry.

34:24.771 --> 34:26.731
They told me everything.

34:28.566 --> 34:31.527
But I just wish
I heard it from you.

34:31.611 --> 34:32.779
MAN:
I'm glad you finally saw

34:32.862 --> 34:34.030
the error in
your ways.

34:34.113 --> 34:37.158
You're free to go.

34:37.241 --> 34:40.244
For now.

34:47.126 --> 34:49.003
What happens now?

34:49.086 --> 34:51.214
I don't know.
I just know there's no time.

34:51.297 --> 34:53.841
But please believe me
when I say I love you.

35:01.599 --> 35:03.017
(gun cocks)

35:03.100 --> 35:04.852
Drop your weapon.

35:16.614 --> 35:18.533
Rina, I...

35:18.616 --> 35:19.659
never imagined
I would be

35:19.742 --> 35:22.370
doing this here, but...

35:22.453 --> 35:25.456
Rina Rollins...

35:27.250 --> 35:29.669
...will you marry me?

35:31.462 --> 35:33.339
Yes.

35:31.462 --> 35:33.339
Yeah?

35:33.422 --> 35:34.340
Yeah?

35:33.422 --> 35:34.340
Yes, of course!

35:38.177 --> 35:39.554
You happy now?

35:39.637 --> 35:41.639
Yeah.

35:52.400 --> 35:53.526
Thank you.

35:54.944 --> 35:57.738
I spoke to CSU.

35:57.822 --> 36:01.200
The lab equipment they're
seizing is worth millions.

36:02.827 --> 36:05.121
How does that help me
find Cade's killers?

36:05.204 --> 36:07.081
It means Jenkins wasn't
the last rung on this ladder.

36:07.164 --> 36:09.375
No way he could
finance all this.

36:09.458 --> 36:11.502
He's working for someone.

36:11.586 --> 36:14.255
Back to square one again.

36:11.586 --> 36:14.255
Chris.

36:14.338 --> 36:17.258
Come on.
We're gonna do what we do.

36:21.178 --> 36:23.097
Okay.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.099
Run me through what you
think we still have.

36:25.182 --> 36:30.021
Stan Jenkins was fired
from his job over a year ago

36:30.104 --> 36:32.273
and there's no record
of employment since then.

36:32.356 --> 36:34.275
So it'd be impossible for him

36:34.358 --> 36:37.278
to finance a drug lab
out of thin air.

36:37.361 --> 36:39.947
Which means we have
a new prime suspect:

36:40.031 --> 36:42.450
someone who could
have killed Cade

36:42.533 --> 36:44.327
to protect their investment.

36:44.410 --> 36:45.953
OFFICER:
Special Agents Pride
and Lasalle.

36:46.037 --> 36:46.913
What's up, Officer?

36:46.037 --> 36:46.913
Just got a call

36:46.996 --> 36:49.582
from the main station.
Someone showed up

36:49.665 --> 36:51.500
saying he wants to confess
to your brother's murder.

36:54.670 --> 36:56.088
DOLAN:
<i>And he called me</i>

36:56.172 --> 37:00.259
on the burner phone
an associate gave him,

37:00.343 --> 37:01.344
said that he wanted to
pay off Will's debt.

37:01.427 --> 37:04.805
So I arranged to meet with him.

37:04.889 --> 37:06.724
Once he'd handed
over the money, I...

37:06.807 --> 37:08.434
I stuck him.

37:08.517 --> 37:09.685
Three times,

37:09.769 --> 37:10.978
aiming
for vital organs.

37:11.062 --> 37:12.480
I wanted
to get done quick.

37:12.563 --> 37:14.440
And then what?

37:14.523 --> 37:16.150
Set the body on fire,

37:16.233 --> 37:17.485
hide the evidence.

37:17.568 --> 37:20.112
But I can't
live with what I did.

37:20.196 --> 37:22.198
I can't eat,
I can't sleep.

37:22.281 --> 37:23.199
I'm so sorry.

37:23.282 --> 37:25.993
I just want this
to be over with.

37:27.536 --> 37:29.705
Why did you kill Cade Lasalle?

37:29.789 --> 37:33.292
Every cent I had
was sunk into that lab.

37:33.376 --> 37:36.170
I was afraid he was gonna get...

37:33.376 --> 37:36.170
This makes no sense.

37:36.253 --> 37:38.172
PRIDE:
Do you really think
he has the money

37:38.255 --> 37:40.299
to spend on that lab?

37:38.255 --> 37:40.299
(whispers):
I don't know.

37:40.383 --> 37:43.552
How about a history
of violence--

37:43.636 --> 37:45.680
has he ever done anything
like this before?

37:45.763 --> 37:48.683
No. He's mostly been picked up
on drug-related offenses.

37:48.766 --> 37:51.310
This stinks, Mr. Walsh.

37:51.394 --> 37:54.188
We haven't analyzed
the knife yet.

37:54.271 --> 37:55.690
But if that is
your brother's blood

37:55.773 --> 37:57.191
and those are
Mr. Dolan's fingerprints,

37:57.274 --> 37:59.193
then I don't see
why I need to be looking

37:59.277 --> 38:01.278
for somebody else
to charge with this crime.

38:01.362 --> 38:02.321
PRIDE:
I've been an investigator

38:02.405 --> 38:05.366
for a long time.

38:05.449 --> 38:06.826
I know

38:06.909 --> 38:08.703
when someone sounds coached.

38:08.786 --> 38:10.329
I appreciate
your experience,

38:10.413 --> 38:13.374
but this is now under my
purview now, Special Agent.

38:13.457 --> 38:15.376
And if he didn't do it,

38:15.459 --> 38:19.255
and the person who did
is still out there?

38:19.338 --> 38:22.049
I understand this has been
difficult for you.

38:22.133 --> 38:24.176
But you need to understand
that you've made my job

38:24.260 --> 38:27.430
more difficult by involving
yourself in this investigation.

38:28.639 --> 38:30.224
You need to back off.

38:33.519 --> 38:35.563
I'll keep you updated.

38:38.274 --> 38:40.359
(door closes)

38:43.279 --> 38:44.363
(Sebastian exhales)

38:46.032 --> 38:47.908
Look, I know that Rina is guilty
of industrial espionage,

38:47.992 --> 38:49.410
I know she's got to go to jail.

38:49.493 --> 38:51.203
Yeah, it's kind of a big deal.

38:49.493 --> 38:51.203
I know, I know.

38:51.287 --> 38:53.205
I just hope the fact
that she didn't actually

38:53.289 --> 38:55.249
turn over any classified intel,

38:55.332 --> 38:57.752
helped rescue Max
and got her handlers arrested,

38:57.835 --> 38:59.795
you know, I hope that helps
keep her sentence low.

38:59.879 --> 39:01.422
Yeah,

39:01.505 --> 39:04.050
well, I'm gonna write
a letter to the judge, so...

39:04.133 --> 39:05.092
Yeah, me, too.

39:05.176 --> 39:06.469
Yeah.

39:10.681 --> 39:12.433
You think Max
is gonna wait for her?

39:12.516 --> 39:14.769
Do you really want to know
what I think?

39:14.852 --> 39:17.646
Uh... Y-Yeah.

39:20.066 --> 39:22.276
Yeah.

39:22.359 --> 39:24.070
I do think he's gonna
wait for her.

39:24.153 --> 39:27.615
Because I think the best things
in life are worth waiting for.

39:27.698 --> 39:29.575
Aw.

39:29.658 --> 39:31.285
Well, what about you?
You think there's anyone

39:31.368 --> 39:32.328
still out there for you?

39:32.411 --> 39:34.163
Maybe.

39:34.246 --> 39:35.956
But right now,
I'm happy as I am.

39:36.040 --> 39:37.625
Yeah.

39:36.040 --> 39:37.625
But I do think

39:37.708 --> 39:39.627
there's someone great
out there waiting

39:39.710 --> 39:41.462
for a wonderful,
smart, funny guy

39:41.545 --> 39:43.255
to come into her life.

39:41.545 --> 39:43.255
Me?

39:43.339 --> 39:44.799
You.

39:43.339 --> 39:44.799
Yeah.

39:44.882 --> 39:47.134
And when that happens...

39:47.218 --> 39:49.011
you're gonna have to
fight me for our house,

39:49.095 --> 39:50.596
'cause it's a sick house
and I want it.

39:50.679 --> 39:51.972
I bought the house.

39:50.679 --> 39:51.972
Yeah, but I pay
just as much rent.

39:52.056 --> 39:54.433
You're my tenant.
That's how that...

39:52.056 --> 39:54.433
Yeah, but you get the cool girl.

39:54.517 --> 39:55.434
You could have a cool girl, too.
You just said

39:55.518 --> 39:56.685
you're happy as you are.

39:56.769 --> 39:58.771
I'm just gonna chill...

39:56.769 --> 39:58.771
Now I'm annoyed.
Get out of my face.

40:01.899 --> 40:04.151
That guy's a minion.
You know that.

40:04.235 --> 40:05.820
He's got bosses, I agree.

40:05.903 --> 40:07.196
Yeah, but the D.A.
doesn't care.

40:07.279 --> 40:10.157
He just sees an easy conviction,
and that's it.

40:10.241 --> 40:11.158
I know, Christopher.

40:11.242 --> 40:13.661
So what are we gonna
do about it?

40:13.744 --> 40:16.997
Well, I think that
Dolan's bosses put him up

40:17.081 --> 40:20.626
to the confession thinking that
we'd stop going after them.

40:20.709 --> 40:24.255
And?

40:20.709 --> 40:24.255
And I think they achieved
the exact opposite.

40:25.297 --> 40:27.967
You and I aren't going anywhere.

40:28.050 --> 40:30.845
We're still on this case, and
we're gonna stay on this case

40:30.928 --> 40:33.180
until we find out what
really happened to Cade

40:33.264 --> 40:35.182
and then we're gonna
make them pay.

40:35.266 --> 40:37.268
That's why you're the King.
