Raven's Home <i> was filmed in front</i>
<i>of a live studio audience.</i>

00:04.904 --> 00:07.891
Okay, we haven't had
Chelsea's cooking in months,

00:07.979 --> 00:10.202
so we're gonna drink this milk
to coat our stomachs.

00:10.290 --> 00:11.508
- Everybody ready?
- Yeah.

00:11.595 --> 00:13.204
Okay, bottoms up!

00:19.009 --> 00:22.149
Okay, I thought we'd start
with an amuse-bouche.

00:22.237 --> 00:24.665
These are medjool dates
stuffed with goat cheese.

00:24.753 --> 00:25.797
Aunt Chelsea, I'll pass.

00:25.885 --> 00:27.618
I don't eat anything
I can't pronounce.

00:28.395 --> 00:29.909
I don't eat dates,

00:30.137 --> 00:31.782
I just go on 'em.

00:33.517 --> 00:35.923
Staring at Rihanna posters
isn't a date.

00:36.455 --> 00:38.054
Listen, you guys,

00:38.142 --> 00:40.696
I know I was
a horrible cook before,

00:40.784 --> 00:42.599
but on the cruise ship
I studied with, like,

00:42.687 --> 00:45.321
all the famous French chefs,
including...

00:45.674 --> 00:47.298
Chef Pierre.

00:48.634 --> 00:50.680
Anyway, um...

00:51.415 --> 00:52.530
Bon appetite!

00:52.618 --> 00:55.071
- Come on, guys. Let's give it a try.
- Yeah.

00:56.930 --> 00:58.977
- This is delicious!
- Yeah?

00:59.639 --> 01:01.171
Who are you?

01:03.002 --> 01:05.095
And what have you
done with my mother?

01:06.552 --> 01:08.608
- Hey, Aunt Chelsea, this is bomb.
- Yeah?

01:08.696 --> 01:10.397
Aunt Chelsea,
as the French say,

01:10.485 --> 01:11.850
this is yum-yum-yum!

01:11.938 --> 01:13.088
Thank you!

01:13.176 --> 01:14.984
Really, Chels? It took you
six months to learn

01:15.072 --> 01:16.796
how to stick some goat cheese
inside of date

01:16.884 --> 01:19.014
and call it a amu-am-am,
call it a ama-ama...

01:19.102 --> 01:20.290
No.

01:21.099 --> 01:23.516
I'm also preparing
a 14-course meal.

01:23.604 --> 01:25.617
Raven,
would like to be my sous chef?

01:25.705 --> 01:26.970
Come on!

01:29.268 --> 01:31.990

eating this good, then yes.

Tess, you making beats
or babysitting police dogs?

02:34.421 --> 02:35.602
I'm making beats.

02:35.681 --> 02:38.430
We're gonna need them to win
that Radio Eclipse Live contest.

02:38.517 --> 02:40.866
That better be good enough

02:40.953 --> 02:43.751

02:46.458 --> 02:48.939
Ignore the camera.

02:49.321 --> 02:51.110
I'm getting BTS.

02:52.126 --> 02:54.813
That's "behind the scenes"
in director talk.

02:54.900 --> 02:56.405
Behind the scenes of what?

02:56.493 --> 02:57.883
I mean, we don't even
have a name yet.

02:57.970 --> 02:59.751
Uh, we do have a name.

02:59.839 --> 03:02.040
"Booker and the Bookettes."

03:04.134 --> 03:05.814
That's funny.

03:06.040 --> 03:07.407
Oh, you're serious?

03:08.625 --> 03:10.124
- No.
- No.

03:10.907 --> 03:13.124
And they're not even called
"groups" anymore, you know?

03:13.212 --> 03:14.833
They're more like "collectives."

03:14.920 --> 03:17.835
- Like a collection of talents.
- Oh, that's what's up, Nia!

03:17.923 --> 03:20.672
- Yeah, we take... we take "Chicago"...
- Mm-hmm.

03:20.759 --> 03:23.132
And "collective,"
we put it together...

03:23.220 --> 03:25.257
- Yeah?
- And we're the "Chi-lective."

03:25.352 --> 03:27.171
- Oh!
- Yeah, I bring the beats.

03:27.259 --> 03:29.312
- Okay.
- Nia brings the vocals.

03:29.400 --> 03:31.550
And, Booker,
you bring the swag.

03:31.637 --> 03:32.684
And, Levi...

03:33.025 --> 03:34.673
what do you do again?

03:34.918 --> 03:36.484
I'm gonna direct the video.

03:37.142 --> 03:39.110
For free.

03:39.845 --> 03:41.015
Okay, let's get started.

03:41.103 --> 03:42.694
How long do we have
your place for?

03:42.781 --> 03:44.275
Yeah, don't worry
about it, small fry.

03:44.383 --> 03:45.599
My mom's working a double,

03:45.687 --> 03:47.250
and my dad's got
a night drive to Georgia.

03:47.337 --> 03:51.503
Wait, you mean, you have the whole
place to yourself, without any parents?

03:51.590 --> 03:53.343
Yeah, but let's keep
that between us.

03:53.431 --> 03:56.306
Okay? 'Cause my parents don't
want anyone up in our business.

03:56.441 --> 03:57.655
Hey, I love it.

03:57.743 --> 04:00.905
No parents, and we can hang here
and finish this.

04:00.993 --> 04:04.132
Yeah, I mean, Mom is
definitely not gonna love it.

04:04.220 --> 04:07.634
- Yeah, well, Mom's not gonna know.
- Agreed?

04:07.814 --> 04:08.995
- Okay...
- Okay? Good.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.798
But first, some ground rules.

04:10.886 --> 04:13.134
Don't... spill...

04:13.368 --> 04:16.329
or touch... anything.

04:16.671 --> 04:20.281
Can... we... breathe?

04:21.940 --> 04:25.860
Oh, Rae, we haven't
laid out like this in forever!

04:25.948 --> 04:28.405
- Just us girls!
- Yeah!

04:28.493 --> 04:29.916
So, what's the haps, huh?

04:30.003 --> 04:31.272
What's the tea?
Spill it.

04:31.413 --> 04:34.531
Okay, well... oh!
My dad came to visit.

04:36.909 --> 04:39.291
I'm sorry, I just got
the funniest text

04:39.379 --> 04:41.626
from Nikos from Mykonos.

04:41.714 --> 04:43.071
Anyway, what else happened?

04:43.159 --> 04:44.259
Oh, well, um...

04:44.347 --> 04:47.233
One Halloween, Booker and I,
we switched bodies for a minute.

04:47.321 --> 04:48.935
What? That's crazy!

04:49.022 --> 04:51.838
- I know!
- No, Nikos just sent me a text

04:51.925 --> 04:55.159
of the sunset we shared
on the Canary Islands.

04:56.133 --> 04:59.150
Guess what. No canaries.

05:00.733 --> 05:02.948
Like I was saying, um...

05:03.239 --> 05:05.384
Let's see... I switched bodies.

05:06.117 --> 05:07.290
I had a huge fashion

05:07.378 --> 05:10.087
- show, too.
- Oh! Nikos is a fashion model!

05:10.175 --> 05:11.694
Yeah.
Or he plays one

05:11.782 --> 05:14.626
and his evil twin
on a Greek soap opera.

05:14.892 --> 05:16.523
- You know what's funny about that, Chels?
- What?

05:16.610 --> 05:18.189
I didn't ask.

05:21.622 --> 05:24.502
Wow, Rae, you seem
really stressed.

05:24.590 --> 05:27.506
On the boat we would use
mindful meditation to relax.

05:27.594 --> 05:29.728
- You know what we do in Chicago to relax?
- Hmm?

05:29.816 --> 05:32.065
We dream about
being on a cruise,

05:32.153 --> 05:34.634

we're raising a bunch of kids.

around in smoke.

Smoke? Well, that's bad.

No. No, no, no,

06:17.845 --> 06:21.360

- Booker, that wasn't a vision.

06:21.838 --> 06:23.970

08:02.649 --> 08:04.949
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

08:10.543 --> 08:11.630
- Hey, Rae!
- Hey!

08:11.718 --> 08:13.305
Hey, I noticed you
cleaned out the closet.

08:13.392 --> 08:15.374
Did you move my wedding dress?
I can't find it.

08:15.694 --> 08:17.663
Oh, uh, which, um...

08:17.829 --> 08:19.765
which... which...
Which wedding, uh...

08:19.853 --> 08:22.354
which wedding dress
are you, uh, speaking of?

08:24.217 --> 08:26.098
The only wedding dress I have.

08:26.186 --> 08:28.253
I wear it every Valentine's Day.

08:29.992 --> 08:31.106
Right, right.

08:31.194 --> 08:33.610
Hey, Chels, remember
that jacket that I made

08:33.703 --> 08:35.636
for the British girl group
Little Mix?

08:35.725 --> 08:37.052
Oh yeah, yeah!

08:37.140 --> 08:40.114
Those jackets
with the Alencon lace.

08:40.202 --> 08:42.193
What? Wait, no!

08:42.288 --> 08:44.382
I repurposed it.
You're welcome.

08:44.814 --> 08:46.483
How could you do that?!

08:46.772 --> 08:47.981
Easy, with some scissors.

08:48.069 --> 08:49.398
No...

08:49.632 --> 08:51.177
You know that's not
what I meant!

08:51.265 --> 08:54.278
I'm sorry, Chels, while you
were sunbathing on a cruise,

08:54.366 --> 08:56.270
I was here with the kids,

08:56.358 --> 08:58.460
trying to raise them
and stay afloat.

08:58.600 --> 09:01.677
Listen, I know my seminars
were kind of unsuccessful,

09:01.765 --> 09:03.098
but I did send back
some money.

09:03.201 --> 09:06.257
Yeah,
and I used that to buy the scissors.

09:07.021 --> 09:09.194
You know what?
Whatever, Rae!

09:11.742 --> 09:14.645
Hey, where's my panini press?
I can't find that either.

09:14.733 --> 09:17.350
Where's my 13-course meal, huh?

09:18.347 --> 09:21.130
French cooking is a mood, okay?

09:21.218 --> 09:23.333
And right now, I am not in it!

09:23.421 --> 09:25.286
Seriously, where's
my panini press, huh? Huh?

09:25.374 --> 09:26.702
What did you do?
Did you cut that up

09:26.789 --> 09:28.822
and make a helmet for Lady Gaga?

09:29.926 --> 09:31.460
- You know what?
- What?

09:31.594 --> 09:33.341
Great idea, Chels!
I wish I did!

09:33.429 --> 09:35.679
Listen, what is going on, okay?

09:35.772 --> 09:38.169
I thought we had all that
bonding time on the Jet Ski.

09:38.257 --> 09:41.304
- I thought we were cool.
- I thought we were going to die.

09:42.023 --> 09:45.692
Listen, all I know is I was
excited to come back, you know?

09:45.780 --> 09:47.450
Levi and my bestie?

09:47.538 --> 09:48.991
But what did I come back to?

09:49.078 --> 09:51.827
A cut-up wedding dress, you
know, a missing panini press,

09:51.914 --> 09:54.697
and just a whole
lot of stress, okay?!

09:55.671 --> 09:57.193
You know what?
Why don't you answer it, Chels?

09:57.280 --> 09:59.513
Go ahead and answer it.
I'm know Nikos is probably texting you.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.288
Oh, Nikos...

10:03.100 --> 10:05.856
'Cause even when you're here,
you're not here, Chels.

10:05.944 --> 10:08.663
Mom, that's not Aunt Chelsea's
phone, that's mine.

10:10.933 --> 10:13.309
Tess just wants to know
when we're headed back over.

10:13.397 --> 10:15.077
I think now would be
a good time.

10:15.202 --> 10:17.387
- If you'll just excuse me.
- Wait a second. Hold up.

10:17.475 --> 10:20.022
Wait, wait, hold on.
Hold it! Hold it!

10:20.202 --> 10:22.309
Now, Tess's mom
seemed really annoyed.

10:22.397 --> 10:24.982
Are you sure it's okay that you guys are
shooting that music video over there?

10:25.069 --> 10:27.059
- Yeah, she just keeps to herself.
- Mm-hmm.

10:27.147 --> 10:29.505
If anything, it's almost
like she's not even there.

10:32.029 --> 10:33.879
<i>Hey Levi,
what are you working on?</i>

10:33.967 --> 10:35.905
I'm sketching out my ideas.

10:36.155 --> 10:38.787
That's what us true artists do.

10:39.428 --> 10:42.162
Yeah, a true artist
doesn't draw stick figures.

10:42.389 --> 10:46.819
Actually, Picasso used stick
figures in <i> Don Quixote.</i> -

10:49.884 --> 10:52.147
All right guys, focus.

10:52.358 --> 10:53.722
The lyrics are good.

10:53.916 --> 10:55.889
But are the semi-finals good?

10:56.600 --> 10:59.827
Smoky flow, big picture.

11:00.016 --> 11:02.272
What is the story we're telling?

11:02.518 --> 11:06.655
The who, the what, the why.

11:07.326 --> 11:12.215
Um, maybe it's about the creative
flow that we've got between us.

11:12.303 --> 11:14.109
You know, when I think
of smoky flow,

11:14.303 --> 11:15.717
I think of smoke.

11:15.898 --> 11:18.998
And, and... I think of flow.

11:19.402 --> 11:22.651
And how we spit that hot fire.

11:22.738 --> 11:23.936
That's it!

11:24.024 --> 11:25.839
- How we spit those flames!

turn it off now.

15:40.428 --> 15:41.858
I already did.

15:46.935 --> 15:49.046

15:51.292 --> 15:52.506
We can use this.

15:52.641 --> 15:54.780
This video's gonna be on fire!

15:54.868 --> 15:55.551
Yeah!

15:55.639 --> 15:57.692
That's not the only thing
that's gonna be on fire.

15:57.780 --> 16:01.257
It's okay, my mom stocks
the fridge when she's away.

16:01.650 --> 16:02.698
Uh-oh.

16:03.151 --> 16:05.251
Oh, your mom's not here?

16:05.999 --> 16:10.491
Ooh, y'all gonna get it!

16:17.239 --> 16:19.187
You guys were in here alone?

16:19.281 --> 16:21.096
You could've burned
the whole building down!

16:21.199 --> 16:23.714
I wanted to tell
you that Tess's parents

16:23.802 --> 16:25.943
are working all the time...

16:28.142 --> 16:30.124
but they told me if I did...

16:30.406 --> 16:35.146
I couldn't direct the video!

16:35.451 --> 16:37.513
What? We did not say that.

16:37.601 --> 16:41.709
And now you're lying about
lying on top of lying.

16:43.438 --> 16:48.193
Sometimes my priorities
get mixed up!

16:49.406 --> 16:51.955
Hey, Levi, cool it
with the fake tears, bruh.

16:52.113 --> 16:54.839
Yeah, your
Auntie Rae's right.

16:54.927 --> 16:58.326
- We're not buying it.
- Why did you kids lie?

16:58.435 --> 16:59.560
Mom...

16:59.805 --> 17:01.586
We didn't lie. No.

17:01.743 --> 17:05.551
I mean, Tess impersonated
her mom, and she lied for us.

17:06.415 --> 17:08.829
Nia, did you just
throw me under the bus?

17:08.916 --> 17:11.943
Hey, sometimes a girl's gotta do
what a girl's gotta do, Tess.

17:12.276 --> 17:14.435
I need everyone to go home.
I need to talk to Tess.

17:14.522 --> 17:16.171
That's right. Come on.
Move it, move it.

17:16.258 --> 17:17.318
Move it, move it.

17:17.406 --> 17:19.442
But we have to figure out
our outfits for the video.

17:19.529 --> 17:22.569
You're talking like somebody who's not
in trouble. Get out, get out, get out!

17:22.954 --> 17:24.936
Tess, where do you
think you're going?

17:25.227 --> 17:27.045
- With them.
- No, sit down.

17:29.328 --> 17:31.576
What is going on
with your parents, Tess?

17:31.664 --> 17:33.638
And why didn't you tell me
you were here alone?

17:34.865 --> 17:36.162
I don't know.

17:36.250 --> 17:37.896
I was embarrassed.

17:38.091 --> 17:40.613
My mom had to work
extra shifts at the hospital

17:40.701 --> 17:42.107
to help with the bills,

17:42.675 --> 17:45.646
because my dad isn't
making the money he used to.

17:47.157 --> 17:49.654
Tess, that's nothing to be
embarrassed about, sweetheart.

17:49.881 --> 17:51.834
There's a lot
of people struggling.

17:52.528 --> 17:54.543
But what I don't understand
is why you didn't tell me

17:54.630 --> 17:56.146
you were here alone.

17:56.331 --> 17:58.185
You could've stayed with us.

17:58.783 --> 18:00.349
We're struggling a little bit.

18:01.183 --> 18:04.091
My parents, they don't
want anybody to know.

18:04.720 --> 18:06.535
We're not anybody, Tess.

18:06.724 --> 18:09.631
We're your family,
and we love you.

18:10.555 --> 18:12.443
So you're gonna stay with us

18:12.531 --> 18:14.154
until your mom
and dad get back, cool?

18:14.242 --> 18:16.006
- Cool.
- Okay.

18:16.249 --> 18:19.029
But I'm not gonna get it
like Booker and Nia, right?

18:19.780 --> 18:21.646
Oh, no, you gon' get it!

18:24.334 --> 18:26.267
I don't get
disciplined too much.

18:27.641 --> 18:29.763
- Thanks, Ms. B.
- You're welcome.

18:34.473 --> 18:37.035
Chelsea, listen, I am tired
of the silent treatment, okay?

18:37.123 --> 18:38.853
I'm sorry I ripped up
your wedding dress.

18:38.941 --> 18:41.279
Oh yeah? Well,
I'm sorry you only have one wig.

18:41.404 --> 18:43.068
No, I don't. I got like...

18:44.613 --> 18:46.599
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

18:47.761 --> 18:49.409
That's okay, that's okay.

18:49.606 --> 18:51.087
Just from this point on,

18:51.175 --> 18:53.023
we have to promise
to be open and honest

18:53.111 --> 18:55.568
and stop keeping things
from each other.

18:55.966 --> 18:57.232
Okay.

19:01.212 --> 19:04.646
It just got to be too much,
Rae, you know?

19:05.788 --> 19:07.443
I lost everything.

19:07.872 --> 19:11.162
My money, my house, my marriage.

19:11.552 --> 19:13.802
I could've come back
sooner, but I...

19:14.045 --> 19:16.545
I stayed on the ship
so long because I...

19:17.089 --> 19:19.865
I needed to get away,
you know?

19:20.701 --> 19:23.607
Thank you so much for taking
such good care of Levi.

19:23.826 --> 19:25.693
Yeah, listen, um...

19:25.781 --> 19:28.225
Now's a really good time
to tell you that

19:28.313 --> 19:30.228
while you were gone,
I, um...

19:30.492 --> 19:32.818
I left Levi at the mall
for two hours.

19:33.202 --> 19:36.351
I wasn't trying to get away.
I just...

19:36.698 --> 19:38.465
I just drove away.

19:40.120 --> 19:43.633
Well, the important thing is,
you know, you went back to get him.

19:46.051 --> 19:47.773
The cop had to drop
him off at home.

19:47.861 --> 19:48.865
Rae...

19:48.953 --> 19:50.788
While we're being honest, right?
And, you know,

19:50.875 --> 19:53.008
the rest of the time,
I took real good care of him.

19:53.810 --> 19:55.125
Yeah.

19:55.213 --> 19:58.951
Well, it looks like a lot's
changed in the last six months.

19:59.039 --> 20:01.351
- Yeah.
- But you know what hasn't changed?

20:01.637 --> 20:03.552
You're still my bestie, Rae.

20:03.679 --> 20:05.141
Always.

20:05.229 --> 20:06.607
- Always.
- Always.

20:06.695 --> 20:08.703
And I would do it all again.

20:08.804 --> 20:09.844
I love you.

20:09.932 --> 20:11.331
I love you.

20:12.692 --> 20:14.231
Okay, so show me Nikos.

20:14.319 --> 20:17.053
Okay, all right. Let me get a picture.
