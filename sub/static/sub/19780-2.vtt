00:08.345 --> 00:09.731
This is what you do when someone is sick.

00:09.733 --> 00:11.332
You make them smoothies.

00:11.334 --> 00:14.135
I think you mean soup, and she's not sick.

00:14.137 --> 00:15.970
She could have a parasitic worm
in her brain,

00:15.972 --> 00:17.438
causing her to behave erratically.

00:19.375 --> 00:20.708
What are you doing?

00:20.710 --> 00:23.578
I got this key the last time
I dropped off Luke.

00:23.580 --> 00:25.046
The nanny gave it to me.

00:25.048 --> 00:26.814
She's new. I took advantage.

00:28.717 --> 00:29.817
It's been four weeks

00:29.819 --> 00:31.486
since she turned down Charlie's proposal.

00:31.488 --> 00:32.720
She's been distant and glum ever since,

00:32.722 --> 00:33.888
and that's not Alex.

00:33.890 --> 00:36.157
They'll sort it out, Shahir. They always do.

00:36.159 --> 00:39.327
Look, I'm Team ShAlex.
It's my job to be here.

00:39.329 --> 00:41.095
You can leave if you want.

00:41.097 --> 00:42.463
Your smoothies taste like vomit.

00:43.732 --> 00:45.867
Alex? It's Maggie and Shahir.

00:45.869 --> 00:47.902
You better not be naked.

00:47.904 --> 00:50.238
Alex?

00:55.845 --> 00:57.845
Charlie! Medic!

00:57.847 --> 01:00.548
I see ghosts.

01:00.550 --> 01:03.818
This is insane. I feel like I'm going crazy.

01:03.820 --> 01:05.053
No, no.

01:05.055 --> 01:08.089
I'll fight for us, I'll...
I'll fight for you.

01:08.091 --> 01:10.091
I know. That's the problem.

01:10.093 --> 01:14.262
It's me. I'm cursed.

01:14.264 --> 01:16.664
I will stay away from him, I swear.

01:16.666 --> 01:17.732
Just please...

01:17.734 --> 01:20.568
Please, please, please let him live.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.074

01:38.955 --> 01:41.289
Maybe it's a midlife crisis.

01:41.291 --> 01:43.458
No. She's not old enough.

01:43.460 --> 01:45.293
How old do you have to be?

01:45.295 --> 01:46.561
Between 43 and 45.

01:46.563 --> 01:48.896
Oh, fun fact... did you know
the male midlife crisis

01:48.898 --> 01:50.665
lasts anywhere between 3 to 10 years

01:50.667 --> 01:52.500
while females only suffer from 2 to 5?

01:52.502 --> 01:54.022
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

01:54.108 --> 01:57.271
Shahir, everything's gonna be just fine.

01:57.273 --> 01:58.806
Oh, my God.

02:01.744 --> 02:04.779
Alex? What's wrong?

02:04.781 --> 02:07.181
I think I did something really stupid.

02:08.917 --> 02:11.152
Okay. It's fine.

02:11.154 --> 02:13.020
We'll just pin it back.

02:13.022 --> 02:14.094
Oh, my God.

02:14.144 --> 02:18.092
Alex. Smoothie.

02:18.094 --> 02:20.561
Yeah, I could use one. Thank you.

02:23.907 --> 02:26.037
We use the microtome
to study the cancer cells.

02:26.087 --> 02:26.992
If they stop dividing,

02:27.042 --> 02:28.407
we know that our gene therapy is working.

02:28.457 --> 02:31.590
And then we use chemo to blast
the existing cancer, and...

02:31.640 --> 02:33.406
And your patients get better.

02:33.456 --> 02:35.442
That's the plan. Any questions?

02:35.492 --> 02:36.610
Yeah.

02:37.080 --> 02:39.171
What's going on
with that little piece of hair?

02:40.598 --> 02:43.684
Uh, I have a short list
of potential candidates.

02:43.686 --> 02:45.153
I just need to run them through Alex,

02:45.155 --> 02:46.220
and then we'll be good to go.

02:46.222 --> 02:47.588
Well, choose wisely.

02:47.590 --> 02:50.525
A study can live or die
by patient selection.

02:50.527 --> 02:51.626
I just think that

02:51.628 --> 02:53.461
if you were to kind of cut it on an angle,

02:53.463 --> 02:55.763
it would kind of highlight
your features better.

02:58.802 --> 03:00.168
Can I talk to you for a sec?

03:00.170 --> 03:02.069
There was this little issue about a thing.

03:04.406 --> 03:06.674
That dating profile we started for you...

03:06.676 --> 03:08.976
I thought that was a bad dream.

03:08.978 --> 03:12.046
Please do not let me drink gin
when I'm feeling vulnerable.

03:12.048 --> 03:14.348
But you only drink gin when
you're feeling vulnerable.

03:14.350 --> 03:15.716
Then don't let me drink gin!

03:15.718 --> 03:18.753
Your profile's had two dozen
hits in the past 48 hours.

03:18.755 --> 03:20.188
Sure, some of them are freaks,

03:20.190 --> 03:22.590
but some of them actually
check off a few of your boxes.

03:22.592 --> 03:24.192
That does not look promising.

03:24.194 --> 03:25.257
Okay, you're not gonna find someone

03:25.307 --> 03:26.732
to check every single one of your boxes.

03:26.782 --> 03:27.650
Nobody's that perfect.

03:27.700 --> 03:30.398
Except Dawn. Anyway.

03:30.400 --> 03:32.266
I have to focus on my cancer study.

03:32.268 --> 03:34.469
Especially now that Alex is so preoccupied.

03:34.471 --> 03:37.104
Yeah, what's going on there
between her and Chuckles?

03:37.106 --> 03:38.406
Eh, just another detour

03:38.408 --> 03:40.608
on their way to "happily ever after."

03:41.877 --> 03:43.478
Looks like your office is all set up.

03:43.480 --> 03:45.346
Let me know if you need anything else, okay?

03:45.348 --> 03:46.673
- Thank you.
- We're good.

03:46.723 --> 03:47.782
Maggie?

03:47.832 --> 03:50.095
Hello, Dr. Palmer.

03:50.145 --> 03:52.660
- Should I put him on the list?
- There is no list.

03:53.490 --> 03:54.989
- Morning.
- Doctor.

03:54.991 --> 03:57.291
But if there was...

03:59.437 --> 04:00.462
You got to woo her, Charlie...

04:00.464 --> 04:02.163
flowers, chocolates, courtside seats.

04:02.165 --> 04:03.765
Whatever it takes to win her back.

04:03.767 --> 04:05.266
She hasn't gone anywhere, Coach.

04:05.268 --> 04:07.302
We're just taking some time
so that she can...

04:07.573 --> 04:08.582
I don't know what.

04:08.632 --> 04:09.604
How long's that gonna take?

04:09.606 --> 04:11.473
Who knows?
Which is why it's important

04:11.475 --> 04:13.541
I get back in the O.R. as soon as possible.

04:13.543 --> 04:15.543
All right, you got knee replacements down.

04:15.545 --> 04:17.445
Let's do something to really test that arm.

04:18.439 --> 04:20.081
But could you cover me up first?
It's freaking me out.

04:20.083 --> 04:21.649
Yeah. Right. Sorry.

04:21.651 --> 04:24.119
Um...

04:24.121 --> 04:25.987
Okay.

04:25.989 --> 04:27.088
Okay.

04:27.090 --> 04:29.424
Why don't I stabilize the sacroiliac joint

04:29.426 --> 04:31.326
using an S.I. screw?

04:31.328 --> 04:34.963
Show me what you got.

04:37.000 --> 04:42.237
On second thought...
let's try a real challenge.

04:42.239 --> 04:44.039
No one likes a show-off, Charlie.

04:44.041 --> 04:45.240
Mm-hmm.

04:50.679 --> 04:52.047
How's the arm?

04:52.049 --> 04:53.748
Hey.

04:53.750 --> 04:55.717
Never better.

04:55.719 --> 04:57.052
Really?

04:57.054 --> 05:00.055
'Cause I could have sworn
you got shot four weeks ago.

05:00.057 --> 05:02.323
Yeah. Well, I'm a fast healer.

05:06.830 --> 05:09.864
Alex. Isn't it time I came home?

05:09.866 --> 05:10.965
Charlie...

05:10.967 --> 05:14.702
Dr. Harris, I'd like to go over your scans.

05:14.704 --> 05:16.771
You want to do it in front of Dr. Reid?

05:16.773 --> 05:18.706
I mean, I can come back if you want.

05:18.708 --> 05:20.942
It's... It's all right.

05:20.944 --> 05:24.012
Um... yeah, we can talk later, okay?

05:26.715 --> 05:28.716
Back on the bench, I guess.

05:32.254 --> 05:33.855
Bree Hannigan and Violet Jackson.

05:33.857 --> 05:35.857
Got sideswiped by a tow truck.

05:37.993 --> 05:38.993
Dr. Reid, Dr. Lin.

05:38.995 --> 05:40.762
This is Bree and this is Violet.

05:40.764 --> 05:42.197
- Hi.
- So, what happened?

05:42.199 --> 05:46.234
We were just sitting at a light,
I was mid-Kelly Clarkson,

05:46.236 --> 05:48.937
like, really going for it,
and then... pfft! wham!

05:48.939 --> 05:50.842
- This...
- The truck hit my side,

05:50.892 --> 05:52.125
and the window shattered.

05:52.175 --> 05:53.875
Should we divide and conquer?

05:53.877 --> 05:56.177
Yes.

05:56.179 --> 05:57.312
The way I see it,

05:57.314 --> 05:59.147
I'm the front-runner
for Chief Surgical Resident,

05:59.149 --> 06:00.715
but I don't want you to let me win

06:00.717 --> 06:02.050
just 'cause we're sleeping together.

06:02.052 --> 06:03.118
Slept together.

06:03.120 --> 06:04.285
We slept together, Cassie.

06:04.287 --> 06:05.687
We're not sleeping together.

06:05.689 --> 06:07.522
Okay. Sure. Whatever.

06:07.524 --> 06:09.390
Thank you.

06:09.392 --> 06:12.093
But the sex was, like, really good.

06:12.095 --> 06:13.294
Way better than before.

06:13.296 --> 06:14.729
So, why would we stop?

06:14.731 --> 06:16.564
So you can focus on being Chief Resident?

06:16.566 --> 06:18.133
I mean, you are the front-runner.

06:18.135 --> 06:20.668
Dr. Sekara. Dr. Williams.

06:20.670 --> 06:21.703
Dr. Kinney.

06:21.705 --> 06:22.904
Good morning. How are you?

06:22.906 --> 06:25.406
Uh, under-caffeinated. Oh.

06:25.408 --> 06:27.976
Thank you, Dr. Williams.

06:27.978 --> 06:31.045
Ugh. A touch too sweet.

06:31.047 --> 06:32.313
Okay, we've got incoming MVCs.

06:32.315 --> 06:33.781
I'm Trauma team leader.

06:33.783 --> 06:36.584
I want you guys scrubbed and
ready to go when we hit the O.R.

06:36.586 --> 06:37.785
Let's go.

06:37.787 --> 06:39.387
Dana, you sure you're ready
to get in the trenches?

06:39.389 --> 06:40.455
What's the matter?

06:40.457 --> 06:41.756
You worried you'll lose our bet?

06:41.758 --> 06:44.159
- Mm, no. You?
- No.

06:44.161 --> 06:46.127
Two more glorious weeks in Trauma,

06:46.129 --> 06:47.729
and I've got you where I want you.

06:47.731 --> 06:48.796
Can't wait.

06:48.798 --> 06:50.031
This one's gonna be nasty.

06:50.033 --> 06:51.065
Yes, indeed.

06:51.067 --> 06:52.901
Okay, let's clear the way to the bay.

06:52.903 --> 06:54.269
- Giddy up.
- Clear the way!

06:54.271 --> 06:55.637
Fernando Esperanza. 19 years old.

06:55.639 --> 06:56.905
Pulse is thready, hypotensive,

06:56.907 --> 06:58.606
third-degree abrasions to his entire torso.

06:59.943 --> 07:01.075
All right, Fernando,
we've got you now.

07:01.077 --> 07:02.577
Okay, let's get this sheet off.

07:02.579 --> 07:03.845
- Oh, boy.
- Aah!

07:03.847 --> 07:05.747
How much morphine is he on?

07:05.749 --> 07:08.216
- Not enough.
- Push 15 more milligrams.

07:08.218 --> 07:09.417
We didn't take his helmet off just in case.

07:09.419 --> 07:11.219
Smart. Somebody call Shahir.

07:11.221 --> 07:12.220
How can I help?

07:12.222 --> 07:13.955
- Check the extremities.
- On it.

07:13.957 --> 07:16.024
Fernando, I need you to look right...

07:16.026 --> 07:17.058
There we go. Good job.

07:17.060 --> 07:19.427
Oh. Fibula's gone, tibia's a mess.

07:19.429 --> 07:21.262
- We need Charlie.
- He's not cleared.

07:21.264 --> 07:23.331
I just watched him put
an S.I. screw by hand.

07:23.333 --> 07:25.533
His arm's fine.

07:25.535 --> 07:27.502
You think anyone else can fix this leg,

07:27.504 --> 07:28.636
go ahead and call them.

07:28.638 --> 07:30.305
His pulse is bottoming out.

07:30.307 --> 07:31.739
Make the call. We got to move.

07:34.211 --> 07:36.244
Somebody page Charlie.

07:36.246 --> 07:37.645
All right, Fernando, stay with me.

07:37.647 --> 07:38.846
It hurts.

07:38.848 --> 07:40.014
Just a little longer.

07:40.016 --> 07:42.617
Once you get to the O.R.,
you won't feel a thing.

07:42.619 --> 07:44.018
It's bad.

07:45.322 --> 07:47.188
- Rails up. Let's move.
- Watch out, watch out.

07:53.362 --> 07:56.998
Game on, Charlie.

08:03.428 --> 08:04.661
Violet, are you ready?

08:04.663 --> 08:06.630
Do you know when Bree will be back?

08:06.632 --> 08:08.265
As soon as her CT scan is done,

08:08.267 --> 08:10.000
Dr. Lin will bring her right back.

08:10.002 --> 08:11.168
But she's okay, right?

08:11.170 --> 08:12.736
Yes. It's just a precaution

08:12.738 --> 08:14.538
because of the seatbelt bruising.

08:14.540 --> 08:17.507
Then maybe I could just
meet her when I get home.

08:17.509 --> 08:19.710
I'm sure she won't take that long.

08:19.712 --> 08:21.778
I... I have a lot to do.

08:21.780 --> 08:23.380
Yeah?

08:23.382 --> 08:24.581
We're getting married.

08:24.583 --> 08:26.116
I'm... I'm trying to plan.

08:26.118 --> 08:27.784
Congratulations.

08:27.786 --> 08:29.920
Yeah, thanks.

08:29.922 --> 08:31.488
We were actually on our way back

08:31.490 --> 08:33.357
from a cake tasting when this happened.

08:33.359 --> 08:35.025
Oh, yeah?
Which one did you choose?

08:35.027 --> 08:36.360
Bree liked the red velvet

08:36.361 --> 08:38.028
until I told her it's made of bugs.

08:39.231 --> 08:40.397
Crushed-up beetles.

08:40.399 --> 08:42.631
That's how they get the red coloring.

08:42.634 --> 08:43.767
That's disgusting.

08:43.769 --> 08:46.370
One last piece.

08:46.372 --> 08:48.305
That's the last one. Good job.

08:48.307 --> 08:50.841
I'm going to go
and get you some bandages.

08:50.843 --> 08:51.975
Don't bother.

08:51.977 --> 08:54.244
I'll... I got lots at home.

08:54.246 --> 08:56.813
Dr. Reid, did you know these two
are getting married?

08:56.815 --> 08:58.415
I did.

08:58.417 --> 08:59.783
You guys should come.

08:59.785 --> 09:01.918
March 19th, the Berkeley Church.

09:01.920 --> 09:03.153
What do you say?

09:03.155 --> 09:04.588
You probably don't want me there.

09:04.590 --> 09:05.822
I'm bad luck with weddings.

09:05.824 --> 09:08.225
We want the biggest party we can get.

09:08.227 --> 09:10.761
But our guest list is still pretty thin.

09:10.763 --> 09:12.796
Our hometown is kind of small.

09:12.798 --> 09:15.565
And we're the only two weirdos
in the village,

09:15.567 --> 09:17.734
so it didn't take us long
to find each other.

09:17.736 --> 09:18.835
Whoa! Oh! Bree!

09:18.837 --> 09:20.504
Bree! What's wrong?

09:20.506 --> 09:22.239
Sit back up here. Talk to me.

09:22.241 --> 09:24.141
Talk to me. Are you in any pain?

09:24.143 --> 09:25.876
Uh, my chest. My chest.

09:25.878 --> 09:27.277
Okay, let's have a listen.

09:27.279 --> 09:29.146
- It hurts when I inhale.
- Okay.

09:29.148 --> 09:31.748
Is it a sharp pain or a dull pain?

09:31.750 --> 09:34.251
Sharp. I have a cramp in my leg.

09:34.253 --> 09:36.586
Why does her leg hurt
if she can't breathe?

09:36.588 --> 09:39.289
Could be a P.E., but we need
a CT angio to confirm.

09:39.291 --> 09:40.390
Okay, right up to I.R.

09:40.392 --> 09:41.958
Yeah. Someone page Dr. Palmer.

09:41.960 --> 09:43.960
Tell him we'll be on our way.

09:43.962 --> 09:46.163
All right, I need you to have
a seat, honey, all right?

09:46.165 --> 09:48.098
Take it easy. We're gonna
take good care of you.

09:48.100 --> 09:49.566
- Got it?
- See you up there.

09:49.568 --> 09:50.567
Yep.

09:50.569 --> 09:51.535
I'm gonna have somebody

09:51.537 --> 09:52.969
bring you to a waiting room on 4,

09:52.971 --> 09:54.104
and I will come and find you

09:54.106 --> 09:55.705
as soon as I know anything, all right?

09:55.707 --> 09:59.943
Man on P.A. system:
Dr. Palmer to I.R. Dr. Palmer to I.R.

10:13.124 --> 10:14.191
All clear.

10:14.193 --> 10:15.308
Okay, let's get back to work.

10:15.358 --> 10:17.027
Dr. Kinney on irrigation.

10:17.077 --> 10:19.930
The skull is intact.

10:19.932 --> 10:20.955
Pupillary response is good.

10:21.005 --> 10:23.433
Can we get a collar on him?

10:23.435 --> 10:25.235
Okay, I need you to go faster.

10:25.237 --> 10:27.237
Well, I'm trying,
but this debris is...

10:27.239 --> 10:28.472
Try faster.

10:28.474 --> 10:30.373
Sekara, flex those pipes.

10:42.220 --> 10:45.388
Uhp! Clamp!

10:45.390 --> 10:46.656
I must have dislodged a clot.

10:46.658 --> 10:48.158
Dr. Williams, I need help over here.

10:51.496 --> 10:54.030
- How's that?
- Perfect.

10:54.032 --> 10:57.134
Hello? Hello!

10:57.136 --> 10:59.870
Can anyone see me?

10:59.872 --> 11:04.441
You? You can see me?

11:04.443 --> 11:06.176
Please. You got to help me, okay?

11:06.178 --> 11:07.277
I think I'm going nuts.

11:07.279 --> 11:08.712
One minute, I'm on my bike,

11:08.714 --> 11:10.747
and the next, I'm trapped in this hospital.

11:12.416 --> 11:15.619
That's my helmet.

11:15.621 --> 11:17.621
Oh, geez. Is... is that me?

11:19.891 --> 11:21.658
Am I dying?

11:23.961 --> 11:25.729
Bree?

11:25.731 --> 11:27.664
Bree, you have a clot in your lung

11:27.666 --> 11:29.533
that's inhibiting your breathing,

11:29.535 --> 11:31.935
but Dr. Palmer is gonna
remove it, all right?

11:31.937 --> 11:34.738
And lucky for you, I am
really good at my job.

11:34.740 --> 11:36.907
I'm scared.

11:36.909 --> 11:37.974
Don't be scared.

11:37.976 --> 11:38.975
Just focus on your breathing

11:38.977 --> 11:40.477
and let us take care of the rest.

11:40.479 --> 11:41.978
You're gonna be all right.

11:47.118 --> 11:49.853
Dr. Reid. How is she?

11:49.855 --> 11:53.823
Bree's having a procedure
to clear her lungs.

11:53.825 --> 11:55.792
Once she's done, we'll move
her to a ward room,

11:55.794 --> 11:57.327
and then you guys can be together.

11:57.329 --> 11:58.562
How did this happen?

11:58.564 --> 12:01.131
We're not quite sure.

12:01.133 --> 12:05.168
If you'll excuse me a moment.

12:05.170 --> 12:06.136
Hey.

12:06.138 --> 12:08.038
Dr. Palmer found something.

12:08.040 --> 12:09.105
Another clot?

12:09.107 --> 12:11.775
A spot on Bree's chest.

12:11.777 --> 12:13.176
A mass.

12:13.178 --> 12:15.612
Cancer could cause
spontaneous pulmonary emboli.

12:15.614 --> 12:17.847
And if it's big enough to see
with a C-arm...

12:17.849 --> 12:19.349
It's probably metastasized.

12:19.351 --> 12:20.817
- Right.
- Dr. Lin, your scans.

12:20.819 --> 12:22.485
Thank you.

12:25.923 --> 12:27.257
It's already in the lung.

12:28.626 --> 12:31.361
What? What's wrong?

12:32.563 --> 12:33.697
Is it that bad?

12:33.699 --> 12:35.365
Violet, we really can't...

12:35.367 --> 12:37.000
Please. Don't do that.

12:37.002 --> 12:38.602
Bree shares everything with me.

12:38.604 --> 12:40.136
Just tell me what's going on.

12:40.138 --> 12:43.540
What do you know about
her family's medical history?

12:43.542 --> 12:47.677
Her mother died of ovarian cancer.

12:51.449 --> 12:54.684
Oh, my God. Is that it?

12:54.686 --> 12:55.852
She has cancer?

12:55.854 --> 12:58.188
Bree has some spots on her breast and lungs.

12:58.190 --> 12:59.489
And we need to do a biopsy.

12:59.491 --> 13:02.292
This can't be happening.

13:02.294 --> 13:03.560
Not today.

13:03.562 --> 13:04.828
Violet, let's not jump
to conclusions, all right?

13:04.830 --> 13:06.396
I have to go.

13:06.398 --> 13:08.098
You're leaving?

13:08.100 --> 13:09.666
At the cake thing this morning, I decided

13:09.668 --> 13:11.167
that I was gonna call off the engagement

13:11.169 --> 13:13.236
as soon as we got home, and then
that stupid tow truck...

13:13.238 --> 13:15.505
Take a deep breath. You're just in shock.

13:19.310 --> 13:20.810
Violet!

13:23.562 --> 13:24.332
Keep debriding.

13:24.382 --> 13:25.713
Get that saline gauze on these wounds.

13:25.763 --> 13:27.397
We don't want him losing any more fluid.

13:27.454 --> 13:28.565
Wayne, how's he doing?

13:28.567 --> 13:30.467
Considering how much of this kid is missing,

13:30.469 --> 13:31.668
pretty good, actually.

13:31.670 --> 13:33.703
Okay, there's 2 inches of bone lost.

13:33.705 --> 13:36.339
I'm gonna need to shorten
the leg to reattach the tibia.

13:36.341 --> 13:38.475
Can we get the pins for the ex-fix, please?

13:38.477 --> 13:40.443
You're gonna have to restore
the blood flow, Charlie.

13:40.445 --> 13:41.878
That leg's been clamped off too long.

13:41.880 --> 13:43.380
Not with these bone shards
sticking out, we won't.

13:43.382 --> 13:45.615
Well, do the vascular work now
while he's stable.

13:45.617 --> 13:47.384
Well, we can't keep him stable
if he's bleeding out

13:47.386 --> 13:49.019
from a laceration
that you should have closed

13:49.021 --> 13:50.020
- five minutes ago.
- Ugh.

13:50.022 --> 13:51.521
My sutures keep tearing the skin.

13:51.523 --> 13:53.023
No, you're trying to do two jobs at once.

13:53.025 --> 13:54.257
Time's up.

13:54.259 --> 13:56.226
Dr. Sekara, take over
for Dr. Kinney, please.

13:56.228 --> 13:57.594
He most certainly will not.

13:57.596 --> 13:59.462
You said it yourself,
the vascular work can't wait.

13:59.464 --> 14:00.497
Go and help Charlie.

14:00.499 --> 14:01.698
- Page Plastics!
- You're here.

14:01.700 --> 14:03.033
Sekara, what are you waiting for?

14:03.035 --> 14:04.968
I'm so sorry. I...

14:04.970 --> 14:06.903
Well, move!

14:06.905 --> 14:10.006
I need a vascular tray
and a boatload of 5-0 sutures.

14:11.475 --> 14:13.343
Please. Tell me what's going on.

14:13.345 --> 14:16.413
I'm gonna give you some space
while you do the vein graft.

14:22.787 --> 14:25.722
We're gonna put a rush on the biopsy results

14:25.724 --> 14:28.425
so we can talk options before you leave.

14:28.427 --> 14:32.062
Dr. Lin, can we talk about
something else, please?

14:32.064 --> 14:33.830
I can't.

14:33.832 --> 14:35.565
We can talk about whatever you like.

14:39.937 --> 14:42.038
Well, we don't have a ton of money,

14:42.040 --> 14:44.074
but for our honeymoon, we're going

14:44.076 --> 14:47.077
to this little poolside resort
just north of the city.

14:47.079 --> 14:49.079
We'll have a couple of margaritas,

14:49.081 --> 14:51.614
and we're hoping it'll be
just like the Dinah.

14:51.616 --> 14:52.882
That sounds lovely.

14:55.253 --> 14:56.853
We ready to go?

14:56.855 --> 14:58.088
Oh, we should wait for Violet.

14:58.090 --> 14:59.155
She'll want to be here.

14:59.157 --> 15:01.357
We can brief her when she gets back.

15:01.359 --> 15:02.792
Oh, where did she go?

15:02.794 --> 15:05.361
She went home to get a few things.

15:05.363 --> 15:07.664
I'm sure she'll be right back.

15:07.666 --> 15:08.865
Oh.

15:14.872 --> 15:17.107
I want to put Bree in the study.

15:17.109 --> 15:18.141
Based on what?

15:18.143 --> 15:19.742
She has metastatic breast cancer.

15:19.744 --> 15:21.044
That's one qualifier.

15:21.046 --> 15:23.079
And her family history suggests
she's BRCA-1 positive.

15:23.081 --> 15:24.347
- That's the second.
- Yes.

15:24.349 --> 15:26.483
But we don't have confirmation
on that just yet.

15:26.485 --> 15:28.051
Her mother died of ovarian cancer.

15:28.053 --> 15:29.085
A strong support system

15:29.087 --> 15:30.587
is key in these kinds of studies.

15:30.589 --> 15:32.856
Okay, we are not gonna give up
on her just because...

15:32.858 --> 15:34.958
Because her only family
just walked out the door?

15:34.960 --> 15:36.126
Violet will come back.

15:36.128 --> 15:37.160
What if she doesn't?

15:37.162 --> 15:39.162
Well, whether she does or she doesn't,

15:39.164 --> 15:40.897
we're putting Bree in the study.

15:40.899 --> 15:42.398
- Because you say so?
- Yes.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.501
If someone needs to be the deciding vote,

15:44.503 --> 15:45.602
it should be me.

15:45.604 --> 15:47.003
Because it's your study, it was your pitch,

15:47.005 --> 15:48.304
and I'm just along for the ride?

15:48.306 --> 15:50.039
You tanked the pitch for your study,

15:50.041 --> 15:51.608
and I let you piggyback on mine.

15:51.610 --> 15:53.643
You know what? Let's not do this here.

15:53.645 --> 15:55.478
I'll put a rush on the biopsy results,

15:55.480 --> 15:57.046
and we can meet in our office.

16:02.419 --> 16:06.189
I need someone to call my dad.

16:06.191 --> 16:08.091
He was waiting for me. He'll be worried.

16:10.995 --> 16:13.129
Have we tried to get ahold of the family

16:13.131 --> 16:14.430
of the patient in O.R. 1?

16:14.432 --> 16:15.865
Yes. His mother's on her way.

16:15.867 --> 16:17.700
What about the father?

16:17.702 --> 16:18.635
He's not in the picture,

16:18.637 --> 16:19.836
according to the mother, anyway.

16:19.838 --> 16:22.071
That's not true, okay? She's lying.

16:24.042 --> 16:25.441
He's asystolic.

16:25.443 --> 16:27.610
Dr. Williams, Dr. Sekara,
look at the monitors.

16:27.612 --> 16:28.711
Assess what's wrong.

16:28.713 --> 16:30.313
He's going into hemorrhagic shock.

16:30.315 --> 16:31.648
No. We just hung another I.V.

16:31.650 --> 16:33.149
It means he's still losing fluid.

16:33.151 --> 16:34.150
It's hypovolemic shock.

16:34.152 --> 16:35.318
Dr. Williams, what next?

16:35.320 --> 16:37.253
Prep the paddles and get me an amp of epi.

16:37.255 --> 16:39.389
Stop!

16:39.391 --> 16:41.491
You missed about three steps.

16:41.493 --> 16:43.326
Hold that open.

16:44.763 --> 16:45.628
Don't worry about the ribs.

16:45.630 --> 16:46.829
We've got bigger problems.

16:46.831 --> 16:48.665
I forgot about cardiac massage.

16:48.667 --> 16:49.766
That's right.

16:49.768 --> 16:51.000
I'll take that amp of epi now, please.

16:53.771 --> 16:56.272
Try the father for me, please.

16:56.274 --> 16:57.340
Okay.

16:57.342 --> 16:58.775
Look.

16:58.777 --> 17:02.312
We'll keep trying him
until we get him, all right?

17:02.314 --> 17:05.682
But in the meantime,
don't go towards the light

17:05.684 --> 17:08.483
or anything vaguely
resembling a tunnel, okay?

17:08.486 --> 17:10.153
Just keep fighting.

17:10.155 --> 17:12.255
Only if you promise me that no matter what,

17:12.257 --> 17:13.323
you won't take my leg.

17:13.325 --> 17:15.090
Your leg is not a priority.

17:15.093 --> 17:16.559
It is to me.

17:16.560 --> 17:17.660
Why would that be?

17:20.064 --> 17:22.665
He left me when I was 6. Okay?

17:22.666 --> 17:25.401
When I was 12, I hopped on a bus

17:25.403 --> 17:27.670
and traveled 500 miles,

17:27.672 --> 17:29.839
and he put me right back on it.

17:29.841 --> 17:32.842
He didn't want to see me. Okay?

17:32.844 --> 17:36.079
This time, I'm not going on a bus.

17:36.081 --> 17:38.615
The motorcycle.

17:38.617 --> 17:40.583
That's his thing.

17:40.585 --> 17:42.919
Riding. And now it's mine, too.

17:42.921 --> 17:45.255
We're supposed to ride Route 66 together.

17:45.257 --> 17:47.523
You take my leg, and that dream is over.

17:47.525 --> 17:50.660
Okay, I know what's it like
to grow up without a father.

17:50.662 --> 17:53.129
Then help me get mine back.

17:53.131 --> 17:55.698
Fix my leg.

18:10.514 --> 18:11.814
Your heart's beating again.

18:24.729 --> 18:27.096
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:27.098 --> 18:29.132
What ya doing?

18:29.134 --> 18:31.534
Oh, you know, stewing.

18:31.536 --> 18:33.369
I've never known you to stew.

18:33.371 --> 18:35.171
Pout, yes. Occasional glower.

18:35.173 --> 18:38.808
Alex and I had our first
professional disagreement

18:38.810 --> 18:41.044
over whether or not to let
a patient into our study.

18:41.046 --> 18:42.979
Mm. I'm sure you'll figure it out.

18:42.981 --> 18:44.681
Will we? Because I can barely

18:44.683 --> 18:46.249
get her to look at this list, let alone...

18:46.251 --> 18:47.250
Ugh, it's the worst

18:47.252 --> 18:48.851
when people won't look at your lists.

18:48.853 --> 18:51.954
Zach, you have to let
this online-dating thing go.

18:51.956 --> 18:53.122
I will.

18:53.124 --> 18:54.791
You just have to pick somebody,
and I'll stop.

18:54.793 --> 18:58.795
Fine. I pick Matilda McPhee.

19:00.597 --> 19:02.765
I don't think she's on my list.

19:02.767 --> 19:05.234
Hmm. She's on mine.

19:05.236 --> 19:06.869
Okay, let's review.

19:06.871 --> 19:09.772
Why did the patient's heart stop?

19:09.774 --> 19:10.840
He's losing too much fluid.

19:10.842 --> 19:11.974
- Dr. Williams?
- Because...

19:11.976 --> 19:13.743
Half the skin on his torso is missing.

19:13.745 --> 19:16.045
You want to keep him stable,
you're gonna have to cover

19:16.047 --> 19:17.980
those wounds with
something more substantial

19:17.982 --> 19:18.981
than saline gauze.

19:18.983 --> 19:20.917
Just from a Plastics perspective.

19:20.919 --> 19:23.720
Any idea on how we do that?

19:23.722 --> 19:25.521
We could use cadaveric skin grafts.

19:25.523 --> 19:27.623
That's a bad idea. A patient this unstable

19:27.625 --> 19:29.826
is gonna reject whatever graft
you use first,

19:29.828 --> 19:32.395
so it's better to waste
synthetic ones than real skin.

19:32.397 --> 19:33.463
Dr. Williams, go and find

19:33.465 --> 19:35.131
all the synthetic grafts that you can.

19:35.133 --> 19:37.867
You want me to leave the O.R.
to collect supplies?

19:37.869 --> 19:39.469
Are you here to help or not?

19:42.339 --> 19:43.706
Done the vein.

19:43.708 --> 19:45.141
Great. Let me do the ex-fix

19:45.143 --> 19:46.476
before you move on to the artery.

19:46.478 --> 19:47.643
Yep.

19:53.817 --> 19:55.551
What is it?

19:55.553 --> 19:58.755
It's nothing.

20:00.458 --> 20:01.858
Still ice cold and pale.

20:01.860 --> 20:03.259
I hate to say it, but...

20:03.261 --> 20:04.360
Then don't.

20:04.362 --> 20:05.695
Well, we can talk about amputation now

20:05.697 --> 20:06.729
or in a few hours

20:06.731 --> 20:08.197
when the foot's complete ischemic.

20:08.199 --> 20:09.932
Well, you do the arterial graft.

20:09.934 --> 20:12.201
If there's still no pulse, then we'll talk.

20:13.837 --> 20:15.505
I'm not giving up on this kid yet.

20:22.800 --> 20:23.676
Look, I get it.

20:23.726 --> 20:26.269
Her partner left and you feel
bad, but you heard Dawn.

20:26.271 --> 20:27.471
We have to be selective.

20:27.473 --> 20:28.905
Bree is a good candidate.

20:28.955 --> 20:29.715
Speaking of which,

20:29.765 --> 20:32.709
Matilda McPhee is coming in
next week to be enrolled.

20:32.711 --> 20:33.977
I haven't looked at her chart.

20:33.979 --> 20:35.345
I know things are complicated

20:35.347 --> 20:37.447
and that you and Charlie
are taking a time-out...

20:37.449 --> 20:38.615
We're not 4 years old.

20:38.617 --> 20:40.484
Well, whatever it is, you're preoccupied.

20:40.486 --> 20:42.284
Why are you cutting off chunks of your hair,

20:42.334 --> 20:44.054
and why is Charlie in a hotel?

20:44.056 --> 20:45.155
Maggie, my personal life

20:45.157 --> 20:46.790
has nothing to do with the study, all right?

20:46.792 --> 20:49.459
Alex. May I speak with you, please?

20:49.461 --> 20:51.294
Shahir, whatever it is,
it's gonna have to wait.

20:51.296 --> 20:52.496
I need to go to the lab.

20:55.066 --> 20:57.234
Yes, I still think
everything is gonna be fine.

20:57.236 --> 20:58.335
Okay?

21:07.145 --> 21:08.879
I come bearing good news.

21:08.881 --> 21:12.282
That seems impossible,
considering the day I'm having.

21:12.284 --> 21:14.951
Well, you meet all the criteria
for the gene therapy study

21:14.953 --> 21:16.486
I've been doing with Dr. Lin.

21:16.488 --> 21:18.421
Oh. What's gene therapy?

21:18.423 --> 21:20.423
We give you a pill every three days.

21:20.425 --> 21:23.393
The pill stops the protein
which causes cell division.

21:23.395 --> 21:26.129
That should stop your cancer from spreading.

21:26.131 --> 21:27.697
We couple that with some chemotherapy,

21:27.699 --> 21:29.299
and it's your best shot at beating this.

21:29.301 --> 21:33.837
Okay. I have to talk it over
with Violet first.

21:33.839 --> 21:37.207
I think you should consider moving on

21:37.209 --> 21:39.910
with or without Violet.

21:39.912 --> 21:41.545
Why would I do that?

21:41.547 --> 21:42.746
In these types of cases,

21:42.748 --> 21:44.414
it's important to move quickly.

21:44.416 --> 21:46.316
I'm sure she'll be back soon.

21:46.318 --> 21:48.818
We can't count on that.

21:48.820 --> 21:51.521
Did she say something to you?

21:51.523 --> 21:53.423
She wasn't thinking clearly.

21:53.425 --> 21:55.592
Dr. Reid, tell me what she said.

21:57.295 --> 21:59.896
She said that she had been
thinking about leaving

21:59.898 --> 22:01.831
even before all of this happened.

22:05.236 --> 22:09.439
But... but we're getting married.

22:09.441 --> 22:11.474
Bree, I'm sorry.

22:14.545 --> 22:18.081
Bree. What's wrong?

22:18.083 --> 22:20.150
You came back.

22:20.152 --> 22:23.019
I got lost coming back from the gift shop.

22:23.021 --> 22:24.888
I didn't know how long you'd be here,

22:24.890 --> 22:27.424
so I just bought everything
I thought you might like.

22:27.426 --> 22:31.761
There are some magazines, some chocolate,

22:31.763 --> 22:36.633
a puzzle, and this guy was on sale,

22:36.635 --> 22:39.002
but he's still pretty cute.

22:41.038 --> 22:42.005
Leave.

22:43.841 --> 22:46.543
I'll come back once you two
have had a moment to talk.

22:46.545 --> 22:48.745
No, I don't want you to be
my doctor anymore.

22:48.747 --> 22:51.381
I don't want to be in your study.

22:51.383 --> 22:53.683
The only thing I want from you
is to leave us alone.

23:04.428 --> 23:05.695
Maggie.

23:05.697 --> 23:07.364
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:07.366 --> 23:09.666
James Wallace.

23:09.668 --> 23:12.402
6', 180 pounds, face like an angel.

23:12.404 --> 23:13.937
You printed them out?

23:13.939 --> 23:15.639
Architect.

23:15.641 --> 23:17.674
His toddler is eating a crayon
in the background.

23:17.676 --> 23:19.809
He might have noticed
if he wasn't flexing so hard.

23:19.811 --> 23:22.078
Mm-hmm.

23:22.080 --> 23:23.413
Ooh.

23:23.415 --> 23:24.547
Kirsten Followes.

23:24.549 --> 23:26.616
Says her fiery hair matches her personality.

23:26.618 --> 23:28.285
The last time I slept with a redhead,

23:28.287 --> 23:29.653
she turned out to be engaged

23:29.655 --> 23:30.745
and promptly moved to Israel.

23:30.795 --> 23:31.430
Well, you are in luck,

23:31.480 --> 23:32.636
because she's not a natural redhead.

23:32.686 --> 23:34.261
- I can tell by the roots.
- Nope.

23:34.311 --> 23:36.359
How about this guy? Hmm?

23:36.361 --> 23:39.396
Huh. Maggie.

23:39.398 --> 23:41.698
Just pick someone.

23:41.940 --> 23:44.501
Oh, I tried, and you rejected me.

23:44.503 --> 23:46.369
Not my fault you feel guilty
about that, Zach.

23:46.371 --> 23:47.771
No...

23:57.782 --> 24:00.050
Ugh! Damn it.

24:08.492 --> 24:10.560
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:10.562 --> 24:13.496
You know, you're actually
probably doing the hospital

24:13.498 --> 24:14.764
a big favor right now.

24:14.766 --> 24:15.899
Who knows the last time

24:15.901 --> 24:17.667
these floors were cleaned properly?

24:17.669 --> 24:19.235
Yeah.

24:19.237 --> 24:20.804
How's Bree?

24:20.806 --> 24:23.373
Well, I told her that her fiancée left her,

24:23.375 --> 24:25.875
and then her fiancée walked into the room.

24:25.877 --> 24:27.577
It's an unorthodox move.

24:27.579 --> 24:29.846
I'm sure you had your reasons.

24:29.848 --> 24:33.016
Oh, and she has cancer,
but you already knew that.

24:33.018 --> 24:35.118
I do. I do know that.

24:35.120 --> 24:37.487
Is she, um...

24:37.489 --> 24:38.888
Is she eligible for your study?

24:38.890 --> 24:41.758
Yeah. But I screwed that up, too.

24:41.760 --> 24:43.626
So, you've just been on one big roll

24:43.628 --> 24:44.728
since I last saw you?

24:44.730 --> 24:46.796
It's a mess.

24:46.798 --> 24:48.231
I'm a mess.

24:48.233 --> 24:50.900
Adversity introduces man to himself.

24:50.902 --> 24:53.703
I mean, well, in this case, a woman, but...

24:53.705 --> 24:56.506
You aren't seriously
quoting Einstein, are you?

24:56.508 --> 24:58.842
I am. I am quoting Einstein.

24:58.844 --> 25:00.577
But my point is

25:00.579 --> 25:03.246
that you do not strike me
as the kind of person

25:03.248 --> 25:05.849
that would let some
adversity keep them down.

25:13.859 --> 25:15.692
Hey. Have you seen Zach?

25:15.694 --> 25:18.094
I thought he was in Dawn's office.

25:19.997 --> 25:22.065
Are you okay?

25:22.067 --> 25:25.735
Yes. No.

25:25.737 --> 25:27.504
It's complicated.

25:27.506 --> 25:29.305
Anything I can do?

25:29.307 --> 25:31.007
Fall in love, start a family.

25:32.944 --> 25:35.378
Oh, you're serious.

25:35.380 --> 25:39.082
Okay. What's up?

25:39.084 --> 25:42.385
You know, when I was diagnosed
with Asperger's,

25:42.387 --> 25:45.989
I saw a lot of counselors,

25:45.991 --> 25:48.358
but the one who helped the most
was a behaviorist.

25:48.360 --> 25:50.593
At least that's what he called himself.

25:50.595 --> 25:52.095
What did he do for you?

25:52.097 --> 25:54.764
We'd role-play different scenarios...

25:54.766 --> 25:58.501
coffee with a friend or a first date.

25:58.503 --> 26:02.305
He'd teach me
the right things to say.

26:02.307 --> 26:05.475
You know, how normal people react to a joke

26:05.477 --> 26:06.676
or a sad story.

26:06.678 --> 26:09.612
How to... how to have empathy.

26:09.614 --> 26:11.614
You have empathy, Shahir.

26:11.616 --> 26:14.250
Yeah, because I studied it, I practiced it.

26:14.252 --> 26:15.652
Just like I practiced

26:15.654 --> 26:18.221
being in a relationship with Jonathan.

26:20.357 --> 26:23.059
I love him.

26:23.061 --> 26:24.527
I love him very much.

26:24.529 --> 26:26.930
Then, what's the problem?

26:26.932 --> 26:31.835
Well, if Charlie and Alex can't make it,

26:31.837 --> 26:34.003
then what chance do I have?

26:34.005 --> 26:35.772
Shahir.

26:45.049 --> 26:46.683
Violet.

26:49.253 --> 26:51.254
I didn't want to tell her.

26:51.256 --> 26:53.356
I think deep down she knows.

26:53.358 --> 26:56.059
She's just better than me at pretending.

26:56.061 --> 26:57.961
Can I ask why?

27:00.498 --> 27:02.532
We fight all the time...

27:02.534 --> 27:04.400
about everything.

27:04.402 --> 27:07.036
I used to think it was
our town or our families

27:07.038 --> 27:09.572
that was making everything
so hard, but then,

27:09.574 --> 27:12.609
we moved here and nothing changed.

27:12.611 --> 27:14.477
Why'd you stay together?

27:14.479 --> 27:18.581
Our whole lives,
it's been Violet and Bree,

27:18.583 --> 27:20.583
Bree and Violet.

27:20.585 --> 27:24.320
We're so young, and I need
to figure things out

27:24.322 --> 27:27.957
because I don't know who I am without her.

27:27.959 --> 27:31.327
This must be really difficult for you.

27:31.329 --> 27:34.197
What choice do I have? She's sick.

27:34.199 --> 27:36.499
Violet, we're gonna do everything we can

27:36.501 --> 27:37.534
to make her well.

27:42.506 --> 27:45.174
Her mother weighed 90 pounds when she died.

27:45.176 --> 27:52.048
She would wail all day and
night, she was in so much pain.

27:52.050 --> 27:55.919
I can't let her go through that alone.

27:55.921 --> 28:00.023
Even if I have to fake it
for 5 or 25 more years.

28:04.395 --> 28:08.164
If she signs up for your study,

28:08.166 --> 28:09.866
that means you'll look after her, right?

28:12.303 --> 28:14.003
Yes.

28:16.106 --> 28:19.876
Good. I'll make sure she does.

28:30.688 --> 28:32.455
And artery's done. Go.

28:32.457 --> 28:33.489
Doppler.

28:38.228 --> 28:40.063
- No pulse.
- Anywhere?

28:45.369 --> 28:46.769
Still nothing.

28:46.771 --> 28:48.504
Then the foot's dead and we need to amputate

28:48.506 --> 28:49.872
before he becomes unstable again.

28:49.874 --> 28:52.008
Go ahead. Cut it off.

28:52.010 --> 28:53.743
Just do it already.

28:53.745 --> 28:55.078
Charlie, make a decision.

28:55.080 --> 28:56.086
We need to get him to the ICU

28:56.136 --> 28:57.374
before he loses any more fluid.

28:57.424 --> 28:59.171
Go on. Let me down.

28:59.221 --> 29:00.680
I'm used to it.

29:00.730 --> 29:02.518
There's something else going on here.

29:05.055 --> 29:08.891
Pulsating in the vessels,
but it stops right there.

29:10.527 --> 29:12.562
There's an injury to the tibial artery.

29:12.564 --> 29:13.630
How did we miss that?

29:13.632 --> 29:14.998
Injury to the leg was masking it.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.200
We couldn't see it till
the blood flow was restored.

29:17.202 --> 29:20.536
I'm gonna need a new 15-blade.

29:30.247 --> 29:33.850
Okay, we'll need two bulldogs
and some 5-0 monofilament.

29:33.852 --> 29:36.519
Sekara, Williams, it's been a long day.

29:36.521 --> 29:37.854
You two can scrub out.

29:37.856 --> 29:39.722
- I'd like to stay.
- Me, too.

29:41.458 --> 29:44.260
There's damage to the intima.

29:44.262 --> 29:46.429
I'm going to tack it up.

29:57.808 --> 29:58.841
You okay?

29:58.843 --> 30:01.411
Long day.

30:01.413 --> 30:03.446
Yeah.

30:06.884 --> 30:08.351
Snips.

30:11.255 --> 30:12.488
Moment of truth.

30:12.490 --> 30:14.090
Doppler.

30:14.092 --> 30:16.492
Let's check for a pulse.

30:22.766 --> 30:24.534
Turn the monitors down, please.

30:46.558 --> 30:47.757
Oh, my God.

30:49.027 --> 30:50.426
Charlie!

30:50.428 --> 30:52.562
- Oh!
- Whoo!

30:56.267 --> 30:58.835
It worked?

31:00.839 --> 31:02.105
Charlie, you did it?

31:18.676 --> 31:22.700
You're right. I do feel guilty, Maggs.

31:22.702 --> 31:24.902
And that sucks 'cause I don't want

31:24.904 --> 31:27.171
to feel guilty when I'm around you.

31:27.173 --> 31:28.973
That is a terrible apology.

31:28.975 --> 31:31.675
So, I pushed this whole
online-dating thing on you

31:31.677 --> 31:33.143
to make myself feel better.

31:33.145 --> 31:37.047
But more than that is,
I want some lucky bastard

31:37.049 --> 31:40.150
or lady bastard to see
how truly awesome you are.

31:40.152 --> 31:41.785
That's better.

31:41.787 --> 31:44.455
I want someone to love you like I love you.

31:44.457 --> 31:46.890
But better than I love you.

31:46.892 --> 31:49.827
And with the sex parts.

31:51.564 --> 31:54.031
I probably could have stopped
two sentences ago.

31:54.033 --> 31:57.401
The point is, I'm sorry, Maggie.

31:59.337 --> 32:00.804
I need more.

32:02.440 --> 32:04.975
Okay.

32:04.977 --> 32:09.480
Remember how you put yourself
through med school?

32:09.482 --> 32:12.783
No. You said you wouldn't bring this up.

32:28.700 --> 32:31.368
Tell her.

32:31.370 --> 32:32.903
- Yeah, I just...
- Okay.

32:32.905 --> 32:37.674
Um, when I went to med school,
I had a couple odd jobs

32:37.676 --> 32:40.878
to pay the bills, and one of them

32:40.880 --> 32:44.681
was working... at Supercuts.

32:45.884 --> 32:48.318
I was really good.

32:48.320 --> 32:50.354
And I'm here to help.

33:02.233 --> 33:04.034
I'm in pretty rough shape, huh?

33:04.036 --> 33:09.306
Well, down but not out, you know?

33:11.543 --> 33:13.944
It's gonna be a long road, Fernando,

33:13.946 --> 33:15.913
but if everything goes well,

33:15.915 --> 33:18.949
you should be able to ride again.

33:18.951 --> 33:23.821
Maybe motorcycles aren't for me.

33:25.924 --> 33:28.692
I thought you wanted to go
on that ride with your dad.

33:28.694 --> 33:33.764
I guess I'm saying, he can
take me or leave me how I am.

33:33.766 --> 33:37.468
You saved my leg, but now it's time

33:37.470 --> 33:39.403
I stand on my own two feet, you know?

33:42.073 --> 33:44.942
Yeah. Screwed-up dads.

33:44.944 --> 33:46.910
Everyone seems to have one.

33:48.680 --> 33:52.015
I don't know. Luke did all right.

33:54.819 --> 33:56.286
I'm gonna go sit with her.

33:56.288 --> 33:58.922
She's always been there
for me no matter what.

34:01.292 --> 34:02.993
The ones who really love you,

34:02.995 --> 34:05.229
they're the ones who will fight for you.

34:21.746 --> 34:23.981
That arm is not okay.

34:23.983 --> 34:27.150
Uh, Palmer says it's healing.

34:27.152 --> 34:29.820
Healing. Not healed.

34:29.822 --> 34:32.121
Come on. Don't be an idiot, Charlie.

34:32.123 --> 34:33.489
I'll keep your secret,

34:33.492 --> 34:36.360
but you stay out of the O.R.
until it's healed.

34:36.362 --> 34:39.795
You're too good to piss it all away.

34:41.900 --> 34:45.302
Thank you... I think.

34:47.705 --> 34:49.406
So, how are things with Alex?

34:49.408 --> 34:51.574
Uh, I think you would know better than me.

34:51.577 --> 34:53.510
That girl.

34:55.713 --> 34:56.847
Well, she loves you.

34:56.849 --> 34:58.849
And if she's taking this much time,

34:58.851 --> 35:00.884
it's because she wants
to find the right words.

35:00.886 --> 35:03.086
Hmm. Yeah.

35:03.088 --> 35:05.889
In the meantime, I'll just
stay here in the dark.

35:05.891 --> 35:08.425
Yeah. Sucks.

35:08.427 --> 35:12.162
Maybe, um...

35:12.164 --> 35:14.264
Maybe it's time to force her hand.

35:14.266 --> 35:16.934
You know, sit her down, make her talk,

35:16.936 --> 35:19.436
right words or not. Just...

35:23.141 --> 35:25.976
God, I felt like a first-year
med student today.

35:25.978 --> 35:27.744
Total amateur hour.

35:27.746 --> 35:31.381
Give me your foot. Come on.

35:31.383 --> 35:32.916
It's Dr. Kinney, you know?

35:32.918 --> 35:35.219
She gets in my head, throws me off my game.

35:35.221 --> 35:37.287
Oh.

35:37.289 --> 35:39.456
God, that feels amazing.

35:39.458 --> 35:42.092
I say we go to the pub,
drink a couple pints...

35:42.094 --> 35:46.330
Or we could skip all that
and just go back to my place.

35:46.332 --> 35:48.198
That's a great idea.

35:48.200 --> 35:49.866
- Shoe.
- Yeah.

35:49.868 --> 35:52.502
Ugh. What a day, huh?

35:52.504 --> 35:53.971
Tell me about it.

35:53.973 --> 35:56.540
- You were great, though.
- Hey.

35:56.542 --> 35:59.076
Just trying to keep up with you two.

35:59.078 --> 36:01.311
Have a good night, Dr. Kinney.

36:01.313 --> 36:03.313
Yeah.

36:06.818 --> 36:08.352
Oh, God.

36:15.059 --> 36:16.460
Tired?

36:16.462 --> 36:17.995
Oh!

36:21.767 --> 36:23.166
No. No, no.

36:23.168 --> 36:24.268
Never better.

36:24.270 --> 36:26.737
Thinking about hitting the gym.

36:30.008 --> 36:31.174
Oh.

36:31.176 --> 36:33.944
Dana, that vascular work
that you did today...

36:33.946 --> 36:35.912
You were a Plastics superstar.

36:35.914 --> 36:37.981
I am not going back to Plastics.

36:37.983 --> 36:41.051
Look at you. You're exhausted.

36:41.053 --> 36:43.820
All right. I will concede one thing.

36:43.822 --> 36:45.255
Trauma is hell.

36:45.257 --> 36:48.392
But I haven't felt a buzz
like this in years.

36:48.394 --> 36:50.927
Okay.

36:50.929 --> 36:53.397
You're on Trauma call tomorrow.

36:55.166 --> 36:57.634
And every fourth day until I say so.

36:57.636 --> 36:59.469
Buzz, buzz.

36:59.471 --> 37:02.039
I'm looking forward to it.

37:02.041 --> 37:03.707
Mm-hmm.

37:20.959 --> 37:23.527
Hi, Jonathan?

37:23.529 --> 37:25.096
It's fine.

37:25.098 --> 37:27.932
I just wanted to hear your voice.

37:27.934 --> 37:30.434
Can you tell me about your day?

37:41.981 --> 37:43.381
This is gonna look great.

38:27.126 --> 38:30.728
Come in.

38:35.734 --> 38:36.767
Hey.

38:36.769 --> 38:38.502
Hi.

38:38.504 --> 38:42.540
You, uh, cut your hair.

38:42.542 --> 38:44.308
It looks good.

38:44.310 --> 38:47.912
Thanks. Kind of spur of the moment.

38:47.914 --> 38:49.680
Do you want a drink?

38:49.682 --> 38:52.116
Oh, yeah.

38:58.190 --> 39:02.393
Uh, the nanny took Luke swimming.

39:02.395 --> 39:04.528
He fell asleep in his spaghetti.

39:04.530 --> 39:07.098
That's, uh... that's my boy.

39:09.067 --> 39:10.734
So, what's going on, Alex?

39:10.736 --> 39:12.603
What's, uh, what's happening?

39:17.843 --> 39:20.311
I think I deserve an explanation.

39:20.313 --> 39:24.515
An honest one.

39:27.153 --> 39:33.224
I... I can't marry you because...

39:33.226 --> 39:39.964
because I made a promise...
to God or whoever,

39:39.966 --> 39:43.567
whatever's out there.

39:43.569 --> 39:47.571
What are you talking about?

39:49.909 --> 39:55.079
When Shahir was removing
your tumor, you, uh...

39:55.081 --> 39:58.115
you flatlined on the table.

39:58.117 --> 40:00.317
And I-I was terrified.

40:00.319 --> 40:02.086
I was desperate.

40:02.088 --> 40:05.189
I... I got down on my knees,
and I made a promise

40:05.191 --> 40:09.193
that I would stay away from you
forever if you lived.

40:09.195 --> 40:12.663
And you lived.

40:12.665 --> 40:15.599
You lived.

40:15.601 --> 40:18.002
And so, maybe that's a sign
that we need to stay apart

40:18.004 --> 40:21.805
because... because I'm bad luck.

40:21.807 --> 40:25.109
Baby, that's... that's insane.

40:27.078 --> 40:29.313
Says the man who talks to ghosts.

40:29.315 --> 40:30.514
Okay.

40:30.516 --> 40:31.782
Well, that's not the first time
you brought that up,

40:31.784 --> 40:33.117
so is that what this is about?

40:33.119 --> 40:34.218
No, you're not listening to me.

40:34.220 --> 40:35.452
No, I am listening to you. I just...

40:35.454 --> 40:37.154
I want to hear something
that makes some sense, okay?

40:37.156 --> 40:38.556
I just want to hear the truth.
What's the truth?

40:38.558 --> 40:39.790
You don't... You don't want the truth.

40:39.792 --> 40:40.991
- Yes, I do want the...
- You want an apology.

40:40.993 --> 40:42.626
No, I... I thought you were
okay with all of that!

40:42.628 --> 40:43.727
I was, I am!

40:43.729 --> 40:45.296
And that you're supportive of me.

40:45.298 --> 40:46.630
I am supportive of you!

40:46.632 --> 40:48.832
I have always been supportive of you.

40:48.834 --> 40:50.301
From the moment we got together,

40:50.303 --> 40:51.802
I have always stood by your side.

40:51.804 --> 40:53.571
When you were Chief and I was a resident.

40:53.573 --> 40:54.905
When you were in a coma,

40:54.907 --> 40:57.374
you couldn't have found a more supportive...

40:57.376 --> 41:00.044
What? What were you gonna say?

41:00.046 --> 41:02.246
Finish it.

41:02.248 --> 41:04.515
A more supportive what?

41:04.517 --> 41:06.283
Wife?

41:06.285 --> 41:07.918
But you're not my wife, Alex.

41:07.920 --> 41:11.188
Because I asked you, and you said no.

41:11.190 --> 41:14.024
Because I... I can't.

41:16.228 --> 41:17.294
Baby.

41:17.296 --> 41:19.063
If there's something broken between us,

41:19.065 --> 41:21.031
just tell me what it is. I'll fix it.

41:21.033 --> 41:22.566
Unless you don't want me to.

41:22.568 --> 41:23.467
Don't you see?

41:23.469 --> 41:24.835
Whenever we're together,

41:24.837 --> 41:27.271
we have these little pockets of happiness,

41:27.273 --> 41:30.107
and then disaster strikes.

41:30.109 --> 41:32.843
That's not a coincidence.

41:32.845 --> 41:34.545
Okay. Okay.

41:39.218 --> 41:41.452
You know what?

41:41.454 --> 41:44.722
I know you had a tough time growing up.

41:44.724 --> 41:47.157
And I know that your mom
put you through the ringer.

41:47.159 --> 41:51.061
I am not her, Alex.

41:51.063 --> 41:52.296
I'm not her.

41:52.298 --> 41:55.199
I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna
pay for her mistakes.

41:55.201 --> 41:56.567
Okay?

41:56.569 --> 41:58.402
Charlie.

41:58.404 --> 42:00.704
You know what?

42:00.706 --> 42:04.074
If you don't believe that
you deserve to be happy,

42:04.076 --> 42:06.243
then maybe you're right.
