00:47.637 --> 00:48.637
Hey.

00:49.455 --> 00:52.087
What are you doing here?
You said the place was gonna be empty.

00:53.220 --> 00:54.353
Change of plans.

00:54.545 --> 00:55.812
I decided to help out.

00:55.918 --> 00:59.458
- You're the boss.
- That's right; I'm the boss. Wait...

01:00.235 --> 01:01.568
Did you wipe your feet?

01:01.875 --> 01:04.542
Yes, sir.
I wiped 'em outside like you said.

01:05.385 --> 01:06.385
Good.

01:07.194 --> 01:08.194
Then let's do it.

01:08.693 --> 01:11.764
- Get started with these right here.
- So, um...

01:13.060 --> 01:16.802
How's this work? I mean,
when do you call the insurance company?

01:18.421 --> 01:20.837
I won't be calling
the insurance company.

01:22.974 --> 01:24.794
- What's that?
- This?

01:25.400 --> 01:26.800
This is your gun, Dewey.

01:27.484 --> 01:28.484
My gun?

01:29.414 --> 01:30.414
This one's mine.

01:31.188 --> 01:33.500
This is the one
I kill the intruder with.

01:33.551 --> 01:34.584
Intruder?

01:36.400 --> 01:37.400
Rob?

01:38.082 --> 01:40.032
What was that?
Are you all right?

01:40.933 --> 01:42.849
I'm fine, ann. Everything's fine.

01:45.197 --> 01:46.197
Better come down.

01:54.742 --> 01:56.037
It sounded like a gun.

02:02.998 --> 02:05.041
- It was.
- Oh, my God.

02:06.357 --> 02:07.457
Rob, is he dead?

02:09.470 --> 02:10.470
What did you do?

02:10.984 --> 02:12.618
He had a gun... this one.

02:14.113 --> 02:15.463
No, wait.

02:17.040 --> 02:18.106
This one.

03:19.189 --> 03:20.272
Oh my God!

03:21.566 --> 03:24.180
You've got to help me. It's my wife...

03:24.679 --> 03:25.829
She's been shot.

03:28.500 --> 03:32.000

04:28.023 --> 04:29.173
It's eight fifteen.

04:29.423 --> 04:31.189
That's it,
I'm officially late for school.

04:31.323 --> 04:33.575
Sweetie, I'm sorry.
I can't just leave. This is my job.

04:33.622 --> 04:35.396
Well, what about Tim?
It's not fair to him.

04:35.454 --> 04:36.773
Don't worry about me, ms. Teeger.

04:36.806 --> 04:39.652
I already finished all my homework...
And all of my classwork.

04:39.687 --> 04:41.254
I told you he was a genius.

04:41.418 --> 04:43.635
But what about me?
This is my third tardy in two weeks.

04:43.674 --> 04:46.096
Ugh, all right, all right, all right.
You're right. okay.

04:46.228 --> 04:48.145
One second. I'll take care of it.

04:50.011 --> 04:52.344
"Dear Mr. Franklin,

04:53.035 --> 04:57.267
"please excuse my daughter Julie
and her boyfriend... "

04:57.317 --> 05:02.398
- Mom.
- Sorry... "Friend, Tim Sussman.

05:03.154 --> 05:05.621
They are late to school today

05:06.083 --> 05:10.983
because as I was driving them
my boss was called in

05:11.155 --> 05:13.939
to the scene of a double homicide.

05:14.559 --> 05:18.175
Thank you, natalie Teeger. 
All right, so

05:18.291 --> 05:20.557
if he has any questions
just have him call me.

05:20.660 --> 05:21.660
I'm sure he will.

05:23.931 --> 05:26.131
- You're not wearing that t-shirt.
- Why not?

05:26.165 --> 05:28.647
Because it's not appropriate honey.
You're in high school now.

05:28.685 --> 05:30.070
I can't take it off.

05:30.504 --> 05:32.254
And I promised him
I'd wear it every day.

05:32.541 --> 05:34.824
- For how long?
- Til I die.

05:35.309 --> 05:37.143
You're gonna wear
that t-shirt until you die?

05:37.393 --> 05:38.393
That's the plan.

05:45.058 --> 05:46.070
Did you know him?

05:49.310 --> 05:50.476
His name is Jordan.

05:50.860 --> 05:52.554
Dewey Jordan. Ring a bell?

05:54.959 --> 05:56.184
Did you ever kill anyone?

05:57.685 --> 05:58.702
Yes, I have.

06:00.158 --> 06:01.829
It's not like in the movies, is it?

06:01.993 --> 06:04.369
- Sorry about this.
- About what?

06:04.628 --> 06:06.061
About calling you in on this one.

06:06.095 --> 06:08.583
Obviously pretty open and shut.
Justifiable homicide. is it?

06:08.616 --> 06:09.633
Isn't it?

06:09.924 --> 06:11.708
When did you buy the gun?

06:13.137 --> 06:15.924
Five months ago. There were
some break-ins down the street.

06:21.120 --> 06:22.587
It's a lucky thing you did

06:23.270 --> 06:25.704
because he would've killed you too.
That's for sure.

06:28.447 --> 06:29.580
I don't feel lucky.

06:29.713 --> 06:31.991
All right, we id'd the bodies. A kid...

06:32.042 --> 06:34.571
A punk named Dewey Jordan.
He lives in Cole Valley.

06:35.242 --> 06:37.985
About 4:00 am,
parks in the driveway right out front.

06:38.535 --> 06:40.018
Point of entry: side patio door.

06:40.052 --> 06:42.528
He parked in the driveway?
That's kind of risky.

06:42.562 --> 06:44.489
- Probably figured he'd be in and out.
- Maybe.

06:44.622 --> 06:48.819
The husband Robert Sherman and
his wife pam, they're upstairs in bed.

06:48.852 --> 06:50.345
She wakes up, says she's cold.

06:50.378 --> 06:52.478
She comes downstairs
to adjust the thermostat.

06:52.582 --> 06:54.682
- Thermostat.
- Yeah, it's right over there.

06:55.195 --> 06:56.506
She confronts the intruder.

06:57.093 --> 06:59.638
He shoots her. One shot, .38 caliber.

06:59.908 --> 07:03.687
Husband hears the shot he grabs his gun.
It's a 9-millimeter glock.

07:03.737 --> 07:06.086
- It's registered we already checked.
- Where was the gun?

07:06.104 --> 07:08.670
Upstairs in a lockbox near the bed.

07:09.020 --> 07:10.507
So he comes running downstairs.

07:10.945 --> 07:14.745
The intruder fires, misses,
hits the wall.

07:15.093 --> 07:20.097
Husband returns fire.
Bang... One shot. End of story.

07:21.485 --> 07:24.085
One shot. Bang...

07:25.512 --> 07:26.529
End of...

07:27.434 --> 07:28.501
Story.

07:29.148 --> 07:31.048
The soles of his shoes are clean.

07:32.348 --> 07:35.483
- So?
- He cut through the garden out back.

07:37.597 --> 07:38.737
You think he wiped his feet?

07:38.772 --> 07:40.929
Well, it makes sense.
He did want to leave footprints.

07:40.945 --> 07:44.287
But he did leave footprints
on the patio. I saw them when I came in.

07:45.428 --> 07:47.195
Why would he wipe his feet?

07:47.778 --> 07:48.802
You wiped your feet.

07:49.075 --> 07:50.121
But I'm me.

07:50.292 --> 07:51.408
That doesn't count.

07:51.625 --> 07:53.583
Why would a kid...
A burglar...

07:54.844 --> 07:57.338
Stop and wipe his feet?
That doesn't make any sense.

07:57.944 --> 07:59.427
Hey, excuse me.

07:59.668 --> 08:01.102
Hello? yeah, you.

08:01.332 --> 08:02.866
Right, yeah. Did you wipe your feet?

08:02.922 --> 08:05.722
Did I... Wipe your feet?
It's a $23,000 rug.

08:05.946 --> 08:09.370
Yes, sir.
I wiped them when I came in.. Ten times.

08:09.837 --> 08:11.026
I don't believe we've met.

08:11.103 --> 08:13.025
Rob Sherman, this is Adrian Monk.

08:13.075 --> 08:15.391
He's a consultant with us,
and I can assure you

08:15.442 --> 08:17.182
that Mr. Monk's feet are clean.

08:17.324 --> 08:19.174
In fact, you could probably
eat off them.

08:20.611 --> 08:23.478
It's nothing personal. It's just...
It was my wife's favorite rug.

08:23.513 --> 08:24.563
I understand.

08:25.210 --> 08:27.440
- Sorry for your loss.
- I guess it, uh...

08:29.445 --> 08:32.370
- Hasn't completely sunk in.
- It will.

08:32.974 --> 08:34.006
It'll sink in.

08:34.357 --> 08:35.357
Completely.

08:35.474 --> 08:37.460
Do you mind if I check upstairs?

09:07.716 --> 09:08.716
how's it going?

09:09.165 --> 09:10.982
Somebody unplugged the phone.

09:12.924 --> 09:14.508
He kept the gun in here?

09:15.224 --> 09:17.391
yeah, Is this how you found it?

09:18.091 --> 09:19.757
Yeah, we locked the place down.

09:21.187 --> 09:22.887
He heard his wife screaming.

09:23.153 --> 09:26.736
- Opened the box, he grabbed the gun.
- Yeah, that's what the man said.

09:27.319 --> 09:29.502
The box is closed, latched.

09:30.086 --> 09:34.475
If I heard my wife screaming, I wouldn't
stop and close the box. Would you?

09:34.925 --> 09:35.942
Oh, I'm not married.

09:39.377 --> 09:40.494
Her slippers.

09:42.077 --> 09:44.827
According to the husband,
she went downstairs

09:45.260 --> 09:46.852
because she was cold.

09:46.960 --> 09:49.041
If she was cold,
why didn't she put on her slippers?

09:49.727 --> 09:51.221
That's a good question.

09:51.377 --> 09:53.877
Yeah... You'll get the next one.

09:54.110 --> 09:56.859
What are you doing?
We're supposed to wait by the car.

09:56.909 --> 09:59.047
It's the final dive.
It's all up to Sussman.

09:59.587 --> 10:00.737
You line your feet up.

10:01.471 --> 10:04.579
You visualize the dive.
And...

10:07.688 --> 10:08.882
8.6.

10:08.971 --> 10:11.353
8.6? Are you kidding me?
That was perfect.

10:11.399 --> 10:14.149
Excuse me.
This is private property here, okay?

10:14.266 --> 10:15.566
Shouldn't you guys be in school?

10:16.480 --> 10:18.307
We're with my mom.
Natalie Teeger.

10:18.686 --> 10:21.263
- She's here with Mr. Monk.
- Yeah, she just went in to get him.

10:21.863 --> 10:22.863
And you are?

10:22.984 --> 10:23.984
I'm...

10:24.793 --> 10:25.859
I'm nobody.

10:26.467 --> 10:28.789
His name is Tim. He's my boyfriend.

10:29.866 --> 10:31.680
Yeah, I can see that from the shirt.

10:32.950 --> 10:36.183
So where were you guys...
Some amusement park?

10:36.248 --> 10:37.685
Um, yeah, the bay city pier.

10:37.756 --> 10:38.756
He works there.

10:38.789 --> 10:42.092
Guess there's no such thing
as dress codes anymore, huh?

10:42.579 --> 10:43.675
Mr. Sherman.

10:44.709 --> 10:46.203
We appreciate your patience.

10:46.230 --> 10:47.547
You can have your house back now.

10:47.630 --> 10:50.254
Do you have any family?
Is there somebody that you can call?

10:50.314 --> 10:51.587
I'll be fine. Thank you.

10:53.346 --> 10:55.030
So what happens now?

10:55.063 --> 10:56.909
Well, the d.A. Will file a report.

10:56.953 --> 10:58.930
And I don't think
have anything to worry about.

10:58.965 --> 11:01.792
Kid broke into your house.
You had every right to defend yourself.

11:02.836 --> 11:06.237
I'm not supposed to say this,
but  I would've done the same thing.

11:06.272 --> 11:09.005
In fact, I would've emptied
my gun into the creep.

11:09.072 --> 11:10.155
Why didn't you?

11:11.235 --> 11:12.984
- Why didn't I what?
- Empty your gun.

11:13.050 --> 11:15.500
You only fired once.
I would think in the heat of the moment.

11:15.534 --> 11:18.417
That's all I needed... one shot.

11:18.983 --> 11:20.200
That's all he need.

11:23.098 --> 11:27.815
I guess that's it. Thank you very much.

11:30.500 --> 11:31.666
Mr. Monk.

11:33.928 --> 11:36.546
- What do you think?
- I think he's the man.

11:37.553 --> 11:38.974
I don't think he's the man.

11:39.789 --> 11:40.939
I think he's the guy.

11:44.431 --> 11:46.831
Okay, let's do it again... from the top.

11:47.853 --> 11:50.547
Husband, Robert Sherman.
Owns expensive rug.

11:50.631 --> 11:52.564
Intruders shoes indicate
that he wiped his feet.

11:52.614 --> 11:54.735
why would a kid breaking and entering
wipe his feet?

11:54.770 --> 11:58.634
Because he wasn't breaking and entering.
They knew each other. It was a setup.

11:58.751 --> 12:01.713
- Maybe...
- Maybe the kid... The intruder...

12:01.801 --> 12:03.734
Was planning on stealing the rug

12:03.951 --> 12:05.451
and he didn't want to scuff it up.

12:05.759 --> 12:07.442
- Thank you.
- Any time.

12:09.528 --> 12:11.828
Maybe he was planning
on stealing the rug.

12:11.928 --> 12:14.728
All right, how about this one?
The phone in the bedroom was unplugged.

12:14.778 --> 12:16.095
That doesn't mean anything.

12:16.191 --> 12:18.126
I unplug my phone all the time...

12:18.282 --> 12:20.749
If I want to sleep late
or if I'm working.

12:20.810 --> 12:22.982
She's right. Doesn't mean anything.

12:23.042 --> 12:24.925
Well, here's another one.
The wife's slippers.

12:24.970 --> 12:27.454
The husband said she was cold.
That's why she went downstairs.

12:27.504 --> 12:29.447
Why wouldn't she put on her slippers?

12:35.515 --> 12:39.584
She wasn't really cold.
She was just saying she was cold.

12:39.617 --> 12:43.008
She went downstairs to get a bite of
that chocolate cake in the refrigerator.

12:43.046 --> 12:45.146
What chocolate cake?
Who are you?

12:45.179 --> 12:48.429
This is rita depask,
aka the lovely rita.

12:48.479 --> 12:50.790
She's a material witness
in a knife fight downtown.

12:50.824 --> 12:52.990
Allegedknife fight.

12:53.058 --> 12:55.599
Alleged. I love that word.

12:56.222 --> 13:00.089
The lovely rita has a point,
amazingly enough.

13:00.522 --> 13:03.556
Any hotshot lawyer could explain
away that entire notebook.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.155
That's true, that's true.
But if you add it all up,

13:06.222 --> 13:08.108
if you look at the big picture.

13:08.205 --> 13:11.801
I mean, it's plain as day. He's the guy.

13:11.933 --> 13:14.100
- Was the wife insured?
- No.

13:14.166 --> 13:15.283
So where's your motive?

13:15.536 --> 13:16.557
Wake up!

13:19.762 --> 13:22.862
You got two people
living under the same roof.

13:23.079 --> 13:24.745
One of them wants the other one dead.

13:24.945 --> 13:26.695
Believe me, I know.

13:27.831 --> 13:29.905
Yeah, he didn't love her.

13:30.180 --> 13:33.069
I was there when the m.E.
Wheeled out the wife.

13:33.269 --> 13:35.236
All he was thinking about was the rug.

13:35.513 --> 13:36.580
You're cute.

13:38.087 --> 13:40.587
- No, I'm not.
- You ever unbutton that top button?

13:40.604 --> 13:41.921
Nah, not... No.

13:42.126 --> 13:44.360
There is one problem with your theory.

13:44.526 --> 13:45.710
They never met.

13:45.976 --> 13:47.147
We checked their records.

13:47.198 --> 13:49.854
The bank records, their phone records.
We talked to their friends.

13:49.898 --> 13:53.432
There is no connection between
Rob Sherman and Dewey Jordan.

13:53.622 --> 13:55.472
I know I've seen them together.

13:55.914 --> 13:58.498
- Where?
- I don't know where! somewhere.

13:58.614 --> 13:59.981
It's driving me crazy.

14:00.181 --> 14:02.581
Well, they lived in different worlds.

14:02.771 --> 14:04.696
Here's Dewey Jordan's rap sheet.

14:04.746 --> 14:08.396
19 arrests, 12 convictions,
bad checks, drugs,

14:08.430 --> 14:09.874
couple of burglaries.

14:10.043 --> 14:11.709
And in sharp contrast,

14:12.159 --> 14:15.893
here is Mr. Sherman's jacket.

14:16.002 --> 14:17.002
One arrest.

14:17.489 --> 14:20.256
One in his entire life.

14:21.231 --> 14:23.181
Driving with a suspended license.

14:32.129 --> 14:33.379
Wait, wait, wait...

14:34.910 --> 14:38.215
- There is a connection.
- Hey, we did it!

14:38.816 --> 14:40.649
You'll mention this to the D.A., right?

14:49.854 --> 14:51.345
Fine, okay.

14:53.678 --> 14:55.878
Oh, my God! It's Clay Bridges.

14:56.077 --> 14:59.005
- Like he even knows who we are.
- Julie, he's so cute!

14:59.165 --> 15:01.569
Is he looking at us? Oh, my God.

15:01.818 --> 15:05.626
- What's he doing?
- He's coming over here.

15:05.873 --> 15:06.997
You're Julie Teeger, right?

15:06.998 --> 15:07.998
I'm Lisa.

15:09.028 --> 15:10.028
Hi.

15:10.178 --> 15:11.278
I've seen you around.

15:11.905 --> 15:13.736
- You have?
- Yeah. I'm Clay.

15:14.093 --> 15:16.785
We know... You had
a great game last Saturday.

15:17.107 --> 15:18.107
Thanks.

15:18.389 --> 15:19.914
You're in honors spanish, right?

15:20.278 --> 15:22.058
I'm taking spanish one and I just...

15:22.098 --> 15:23.470
I can't seem to get it.

15:23.533 --> 15:26.903
You know, some sort of mental block
or something. I was thinking, um,

15:27.168 --> 15:28.536
maybe you could tutor me?

15:29.447 --> 15:32.280
Um, well, actually, I'm getting ab.
But I could recommend somebody...

15:32.330 --> 15:34.180
Oh, no, I'm asking you.

15:36.388 --> 15:37.388
Yes or no?

15:37.886 --> 15:38.886
Moment of truth.

15:41.581 --> 15:44.617
- Okay. Sure.
- Cool. All right.

15:47.031 --> 15:48.101
Hang on.

15:48.312 --> 15:49.322
Who is that?

15:49.808 --> 15:51.187
My boyfriend... Tim Sussman.

15:51.204 --> 15:54.006
Yeah, I know him.
He's, he's in the band or something.

15:54.109 --> 15:55.192
The swim team.

15:56.292 --> 15:58.229
- I don't remember him.
- He's a diver.

15:59.210 --> 16:03.165
Coach doesn't really use him very much.
Towel boy, huh?

16:17.086 --> 16:19.753
This doesn't feel right.
Meeting him here.

16:20.170 --> 16:21.670
What choice did we have?

16:22.372 --> 16:25.462
He wouldn't see me at his office,
and he's not returning my phone calls.

16:25.512 --> 16:27.429
Yeah, I know, but this is his wife.

16:27.817 --> 16:29.467
Who he killed in cold blood.

16:29.522 --> 16:30.722
Don't forget that.

16:34.002 --> 16:36.986
Gosh. I remember when
Mitch's father was cremated.

16:37.160 --> 16:39.265
We went to carolina and spread his ashes

16:39.476 --> 16:41.093
on the beach.

16:44.826 --> 16:46.438
I'm gonna be buried next to Trudy.

16:47.998 --> 16:49.098
I can't wait.

16:49.455 --> 16:52.214
I'm really missing Mitch lately.

16:53.282 --> 16:55.515
You know?
He would know what to do with Julie.

16:57.097 --> 17:00.021
She started tutoring
this older kid in spanish.

17:00.055 --> 17:03.051
- This senior... A big football star.
- Right.

17:03.118 --> 17:05.554
Just yesterday she was
crawling around in diapers.

17:05.589 --> 17:09.911
And today I'm worried about
some 17-year-old quarterback named Clay.

17:10.878 --> 17:12.731
- Right.
- What did you do?

17:14.151 --> 17:15.522
Skinny, fat, skinny, fat.

17:15.579 --> 17:17.963
Skinny believe me; this is the way
they would've wanted it.

17:17.997 --> 17:18.997
Yeah, but Mr. Monk...

17:19.112 --> 17:21.412
No, what are you doing?
The name tags are all mixed up.

17:21.444 --> 17:23.373
- Yeah, I know, but...
- No I know that this one

17:23.414 --> 17:24.929
- went over here.
- No, this is her.

17:24.979 --> 17:26.391
- This one.
- All right, I got it.

17:26.450 --> 17:27.821
No, I got it...

17:30.375 --> 17:31.492
That's no good.

17:31.780 --> 17:32.780
I got it.

17:43.043 --> 17:45.002
- What are you doing?
- Separating them.

17:45.052 --> 17:47.323
- What, you could tell?
- I can tell...

17:47.461 --> 17:50.345
More or less. Just don't sneeze.

17:51.106 --> 17:52.443
Somebody's coming.

17:59.364 --> 18:01.528
- What are you doing?
- It's uneven.

18:01.570 --> 18:04.127
Mr. Monk, those are people!
Maybe they weren't the same size.

18:04.177 --> 18:05.310
Well, they are now.

18:22.582 --> 18:23.614
Mr. Monk.

18:23.665 --> 18:25.448
- Hello!
- Hello again.

18:26.130 --> 18:28.297
- What are you doing here?
- Are you family?

18:29.814 --> 18:32.598
No, we are, uh... We're with the police.

18:32.852 --> 18:36.284
Mr. Sherman, I'm sorry about this.
I've been trying to call you all day.

18:36.317 --> 18:38.584
Yeah, so I've heard.
You got a problem with me Mr. Monk?

18:38.600 --> 18:41.529
No... Just a couple of questions.
Part of the investigation.

18:41.579 --> 18:44.045
What investigation?
I spoke with the district attorney.

18:44.078 --> 18:46.700
- He said the case was closed.
- What happened here?

18:47.270 --> 18:48.270
The wind.

18:48.320 --> 18:50.298
- Just a draft.
- Like a tunnel.

18:50.331 --> 18:51.841
Table's a little wobbly.

18:51.882 --> 18:54.132
You might want to put a matchbook.
But we cleaned it up.

18:54.198 --> 18:55.693
- A draft?
- It's no problem.

18:56.801 --> 19:01.696
You... You told the police that you
didn't know Dewey Jordan, the man

19:01.728 --> 19:04.018
- you killed you said you never met him.
- That's right.

19:04.068 --> 19:06.651
But you were in traffic court
four weeks ago,

19:06.701 --> 19:10.369
august 14th, 8:00 am,
the vinton street courthouse.

19:11.975 --> 19:17.708
And this is Dewey's rap sheet.
He was at a bail reduction hearing.

19:18.100 --> 19:19.784
Same courthouse.

19:20.084 --> 19:22.717
Same day, 8:00 am.

19:23.154 --> 19:24.638
Is that where you met him?

19:26.465 --> 19:27.582
Mr. Sherman.

19:28.198 --> 19:29.262
Is there a problem?

19:29.625 --> 19:31.652
No... No, there's no problem.

19:31.686 --> 19:35.190
No problem at all.
This is my, secretary, allison clark.

19:35.257 --> 19:36.986
Well, you're right, Mr. Monk.

19:37.021 --> 19:40.182
It appears that Mr. Jordan
and I were in the same building.

19:40.219 --> 19:41.836
On the same day

19:42.461 --> 19:46.870
a few weeks before he was shot.
And I don't believe in coincidence.

19:46.903 --> 19:47.916
No, neither do I.

19:48.966 --> 19:50.382
Maybe that's where he saw me.

19:50.922 --> 19:53.756
- Excuse me.
- Maybe he saw me pull up in my bmw.

19:53.822 --> 19:57.039
Wearing this suit and this $5,000

19:57.078 --> 20:00.006
rolex watch and that's where he decided
to try and rob me.

20:00.920 --> 20:03.806
Now, that's possible. Isn't it?

20:09.520 --> 20:12.971
- I'm sorry; I couldn't hear you.
- Yes, it's possible.

20:13.502 --> 20:14.619
Uh, we have to go.

20:20.035 --> 20:21.201
Is that her?

20:23.425 --> 20:24.530
That's... Mostly her.

20:26.545 --> 20:28.159
Anything else, Mr. Monk?

20:30.039 --> 20:31.039
I didn't think so.

20:42.082 --> 20:46.575
Megu... Me gusta mi hermano.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.931
No,mi hermana, remember?

20:49.348 --> 20:51.898
Feminine words end in "a." it's easy.

20:51.964 --> 20:55.007
No... Screen passes are easy.
This is hard.

20:55.641 --> 21:00.358
Okay, and masculine words end in "o."
likemi amigo.

21:01.615 --> 21:02.615
I hope so.

21:03.819 --> 21:08.119
I was actually hoping we could be more

21:08.168 --> 21:09.168
thanamigos.

21:09.263 --> 21:11.980
Honey, it's 10:30. Didn't you say you
wanted to get to bed early?

21:13.135 --> 21:15.052
No... No, I didn't.

21:15.094 --> 21:17.858
Well, it's probably a good idea.
You have a big day tomorrow.

21:18.024 --> 21:20.141
Clay, see you maniana.

21:21.314 --> 21:22.314
What?

21:22.384 --> 21:25.651
- Tomorrow.
- I guess that's my cue.

21:27.198 --> 21:28.250
I'll see you around.

21:29.352 --> 21:31.782
Hey, you've got study hall
second period, right?

21:32.620 --> 21:34.137
Yeah, how'd you know that?

21:34.570 --> 21:36.453
Well, quarterback has to see
the whole field.

21:52.888 --> 21:56.138
- It's me. I just left her.
- It's only 10:30.

21:56.253 --> 21:57.835
Her mom kicked me out, but don't worry.

21:57.869 --> 21:58.969
It's going fine.

21:59.216 --> 22:01.648
She's hooked. I can tell.
I just gotta reel her in.

22:02.639 --> 22:04.455
Well, reel her in quick.

22:07.426 --> 22:10.907
- Did he ask her out?
- Not yet. Maybe tomorrow.

22:11.855 --> 22:15.353
Relax. She likes him. It's gonna happen.

22:15.991 --> 22:17.858
Just like you planned.

22:25.094 --> 22:28.387
I'm not saying no. I'm just saying
that I have to think about it.

22:28.587 --> 22:30.673
When did he ask you?

22:31.350 --> 22:34.816
- Just now. Like, ten minutes ago.
- I didn't hear the phone ring.

22:34.900 --> 22:36.450
It's called a text message.

22:36.767 --> 22:38.500
Welcome to the 21st century, mom.

22:39.050 --> 22:41.253
It's just one party. It's no big deal.

22:41.303 --> 22:43.537
Okay, then how would you get there.

22:43.870 --> 22:44.996
He would drive me.

22:45.137 --> 22:48.670
Clay is, like, the most popular
uy in school, and he really likes me.

22:48.890 --> 22:52.170
And if you don't let me go,
then I'm never gonna talk to you again.

22:52.861 --> 22:54.214
Sweetie, what are you doing?

22:54.497 --> 22:57.121
This is stuff Tim gave me.
I'm getting rid of it.

22:59.164 --> 23:01.099
You're breaking up?
We already did. When?

23:01.192 --> 23:02.719
- Just now!
- I don't believe it.

23:02.746 --> 23:04.474
You don't, huh? Well, keep watching.

23:04.574 --> 23:06.202
Why? Tim was so great.

23:06.235 --> 23:08.786
Of course you liked him.
Mothers love Tim.

23:08.843 --> 23:10.773
He's... He's safe and he's polite..

23:10.806 --> 23:12.903
And smart, and he's cute,
and he's on the swim team.

23:12.939 --> 23:15.212
Great! Why don't you date him?

23:15.699 --> 23:16.749
Wait, what are you doing?

23:16.782 --> 23:19.182
Don't... Don't do that.
Come on, let's just talk about this.

23:19.248 --> 23:21.428
It's my life, mom.
Yeah, I know it is, honey.

23:21.478 --> 23:22.828
Well, you don't act like it.

23:22.978 --> 23:26.636
And just rember, in
four and a half months, I'm gonna be 16!

23:28.909 --> 23:30.325
What does that mean?

23:51.850 --> 23:53.134
How long did he live here?

23:53.433 --> 23:54.550
Ten months.

23:55.024 --> 23:57.024
I should've known
he was gonna be trouble.

23:57.291 --> 23:59.941
Always late with the rent.
Always coming and going.

24:00.924 --> 24:04.934
I mean, is it true what they're saying?
He broke in and killed the guy's wife?

24:05.442 --> 24:07.209
I don't know.

24:08.366 --> 24:09.799
I don't think so.

24:10.744 --> 24:12.544
She'll be 16. Four and a half months.

24:12.577 --> 24:17.108
Stop torturing yourself.
It doesn't mean anything.

24:17.342 --> 24:18.589
- You think so?
- Of course.

24:18.622 --> 24:21.940
She's looking forward to her birthday.
It's no big deal.

24:22.523 --> 24:24.191
- This is your daughter?
- Yeah.

24:32.706 --> 24:33.939
What is it?

24:34.756 --> 24:36.072
This air vent...

24:36.640 --> 24:38.795
- It's rusty.
- So?

24:39.076 --> 24:40.526
The screws are brand new.

24:40.716 --> 24:41.983
Do you have a screwdriver?

24:44.840 --> 24:47.912
Mr. Monk, I just don't think
you're getting it. He's a senior.

24:47.979 --> 24:51.597
He's like an adult. He invited her
to a party on Saturday night.

24:51.630 --> 24:54.532
- There will be college kids there.
- She'll be fine.

24:54.678 --> 24:56.736
There'll be a lot
of other people around, right?

24:56.786 --> 25:00.019
No, I'm not worried about the party.
I'm worried about after the party.

25:00.552 --> 25:01.785
Oh, God, Mitch.

25:02.428 --> 25:03.765
I miss you.

25:05.782 --> 25:08.176
Mr. Monk? Will you talk to her?

25:09.391 --> 25:10.724
- Me?
- Please,

25:10.824 --> 25:13.644
I don't know who else to ask.
There's no man in her life.

25:14.809 --> 25:15.809
What about him?

25:16.559 --> 25:17.642
Who, Mr. Morrissey?

25:18.175 --> 25:20.108
Kids respect landlords.

25:20.456 --> 25:22.239
I think it's the keys.

25:28.849 --> 25:29.849
What is it?

25:30.972 --> 25:32.155
It's a.22.

25:34.652 --> 25:36.315
Why didn't he bring this gun?

25:36.959 --> 25:38.476
So he had another gun.

25:38.993 --> 25:42.693
But there's no ammo for a.38 caliber.

25:43.519 --> 25:44.969
It's all for this gun.

25:46.452 --> 25:49.526
I don't think he had another gun.
Mr. Monk, please.

25:49.616 --> 25:50.831
This is important to me.

25:50.931 --> 25:53.435
Julie loves you.
You're like family... You know that.

25:53.466 --> 25:56.066
Just... I-can't... I just can't.

25:56.478 --> 25:59.611
Why don't you ask the Captain
or anybody else.

25:59.853 --> 26:02.661
When it comes to this particular issue,

26:03.641 --> 26:06.993
I'm probably the least qualified
person in north america.

26:07.026 --> 26:08.658
That's what makes you perfect.

26:08.875 --> 26:11.404
You waited for Trudy. You were faithful.

26:11.520 --> 26:14.470
You respected her.
You're a wonderful role model.

26:15.491 --> 26:16.957
In this particular case.

26:17.917 --> 26:20.484
Why don't you just give it a few weeks?

26:20.601 --> 26:21.984
See how it goes.

26:22.168 --> 26:25.701
I always find doing nothing
and never mentioning it again

26:26.088 --> 26:27.454
is always the best policy.

26:27.561 --> 26:29.895
Mr. Monk, two weeks will be too late.

26:30.128 --> 26:32.961
Please, please talk to her.

26:33.470 --> 26:34.603
It's my daughter.

26:35.298 --> 26:36.548
My little girl.

26:50.352 --> 26:53.237
- Mr. Monk, are you still here?
- Yeah, I just...

26:55.165 --> 26:56.210
Do you have a minute?

26:56.845 --> 26:57.912
Sure.

26:58.144 --> 27:01.784
Um, Julie, your mother...

27:02.065 --> 27:04.515
Is, uh, very worried about you.

27:10.044 --> 27:11.061
What's going on?

27:11.261 --> 27:12.811
She wanted me to talk to you about...

27:14.644 --> 27:16.228
Certain things about life.

27:16.922 --> 27:19.339
And, uh... And things...

27:25.094 --> 27:26.811
She thought it might be helpful

27:27.510 --> 27:30.423
if you had someone you could talk to.

27:30.518 --> 27:32.376
I'm supposed
to be giving you the big talk.

27:32.652 --> 27:33.652
Why?

27:33.961 --> 27:35.364
Because you're dating an older boy.

27:35.484 --> 27:36.484
No, I mean why you?

27:36.816 --> 27:38.520
That's what I said.

27:39.449 --> 27:45.266
See, Julie, the years between 14 and 32

27:45.443 --> 27:48.541
are a very confusing time
for a young girl.

27:48.591 --> 27:50.024
I really appreciate this.

27:50.474 --> 27:52.926
It'll just be
a couple more minutes, okay?

27:54.209 --> 27:56.924
You know, you're body's changing.

27:57.596 --> 27:59.732
You're gonna start
feeling things... New things.

27:59.862 --> 28:03.479
And you're gonna wonder
how to act and what to do.

28:05.848 --> 28:09.064
It might be best just to wait...

28:09.497 --> 28:11.414
Until you meet the right person.

28:11.797 --> 28:14.997
Or you don't have to do anything, right?

28:15.364 --> 28:17.931
Until... Until you're sure.

28:20.077 --> 28:21.670
You have any questions? no?

28:23.137 --> 28:26.204
Great, well, I'm-I'm-I'm glad
we had this little talk.

28:26.533 --> 28:30.100
I can tell that it's been
very helpful to you.

28:31.448 --> 28:36.898
We certainly had a positive,
very, very productive talk.

28:37.617 --> 28:39.301
This is the end of the talk.

28:40.234 --> 28:41.317
Wait, Mr. Monk.

28:42.084 --> 28:43.267
How do you know if...

28:44.112 --> 28:45.645
What you're feeling is real?

28:45.979 --> 28:48.049
- What are you doing?
- No, I'm serious.

28:48.907 --> 28:50.808
When you met Trudy...

28:51.026 --> 28:54.164
- How did you know?
- Listen. This is not real.

28:54.543 --> 28:56.660
I'm not really here, okay?

28:57.326 --> 28:58.826
This is just for your mother.

28:59.860 --> 29:04.454
Don't cry. you can't cry.

29:04.629 --> 29:06.394
I can't leave if you're crying.

29:06.772 --> 29:10.772
What you're feeling is perfectly normal.
What you're feeling is probably normal.

29:12.772 --> 29:16.272
It's just... How did you know?

29:20.604 --> 29:21.954
Okay, look...

29:27.033 --> 29:28.717
I used to wonder the same thing.

29:31.505 --> 29:35.722
When I met Trudy, I said, "now I see.

29:37.005 --> 29:41.760
- Now I see why I'm here."
- was it wonderful?

29:41.945 --> 29:42.945
Yeah.

29:43.203 --> 29:45.686
I loved falling in love with her.

29:46.253 --> 29:50.627
Every day, every morning,
I fell in love with her again.

29:52.554 --> 29:57.412
I think what your mother has been
trying to say is just don't worry.

29:58.419 --> 30:01.351
All your dreams will come true.

30:03.453 --> 30:06.653
They don't have to come true
this weekend.

30:07.400 --> 30:08.417
Right?

30:08.900 --> 30:10.467
You can take your time.

30:11.584 --> 30:13.917
You can wait. Until I find Trudy.

30:14.751 --> 30:15.834
Just wait for Trudy.

30:16.890 --> 30:18.090
Believe in Trudy.

30:19.198 --> 30:20.423
Trudy will come.

30:22.497 --> 30:24.097
Now stop crying...

30:24.938 --> 30:25.997
And let me out of here.

30:34.488 --> 30:35.488
Captain.

30:36.879 --> 30:38.230
Make yourself at home, randy.

30:38.279 --> 30:39.479
Door was open.

30:39.810 --> 30:42.099
- What's going on?
- I think Monk was right.

30:42.194 --> 30:45.079
It looks like Rob Sherman and
Dewey Jordan did meet at the courthouse.

30:45.844 --> 30:49.261
This is the security camera from the
main lobby, august 14th, 8:00 a.M.

30:50.479 --> 30:51.745
I can't see anything.

30:52.779 --> 30:54.912
This is Rob Sherman;
that's Dewey Jordan.

30:56.265 --> 30:57.265
Where?

30:57.565 --> 30:59.581
Right there. Here.

31:00.319 --> 31:01.786
Here and there.

31:02.570 --> 31:05.316
Randy, they're two blurs.
Even for blurs, they're blurry.

31:06.116 --> 31:08.155
- Can you make it bigger?
- It's already enhanced.

31:09.345 --> 31:12.807
Well, that could be anybody. That
could be fred astaire and ginger rogers.

31:13.373 --> 31:14.394
But they're both dead.

31:14.680 --> 31:16.130
Ginger rogers is not dead.

31:16.180 --> 31:18.415
Yeah, I'm pretty sure she is dead.
I'm sorry.

31:18.628 --> 31:20.654
Even if she wasn't,
what would fred and ginger

31:20.713 --> 31:21.981
be doing in the courthouse?

31:22.039 --> 31:24.858
I'm not saying it is fred and ginger,
I'm just saying

31:24.906 --> 31:26.808
that you can't tell who
or what they are.

31:27.415 --> 31:28.615
Yeah, look...

31:31.082 --> 31:32.082
Right...

31:32.394 --> 31:33.394
There.

31:34.329 --> 31:35.329
See?

31:35.445 --> 31:38.161
He comes in, they shake hands.

31:38.702 --> 31:40.435
That is definitely Rob Sherman.

31:41.952 --> 31:43.502
Is that a permanent marker?

31:45.681 --> 31:46.748
No, it'll come off.

31:51.614 --> 31:52.831
I don't think so.

32:05.605 --> 32:08.859
Have you seen the new screens?
Pretty beautiful.

32:08.943 --> 32:09.989
Flat.

32:11.253 --> 32:12.541
You're worse than Monk.

32:19.651 --> 32:21.818
Well, I just wanted to thank you again.

32:21.868 --> 32:24.218
Oh, I'm glad I could help.

32:24.372 --> 32:26.250
Be careful,
I don't want them to get wrinkled.

32:26.294 --> 32:28.865
Oh, sorry.

32:29.328 --> 32:33.449
Well, Julie told me about how you talked
about Trudy and how you met.

32:33.505 --> 32:37.060
She just said it was really,
really sweet. So, thank you.

32:38.103 --> 32:41.087
- What lesen?
- That's Clay!

32:41.470 --> 32:42.470
Is that Julie?

32:43.887 --> 32:45.620
What did you say to her?

32:50.952 --> 32:52.019
Excuse me.

32:52.702 --> 32:53.702
Ms. Teeger.

32:54.826 --> 32:57.956
Sorry... Does Julie know about this?

32:58.273 --> 32:59.387
Who's Julie?

32:59.555 --> 33:01.049
This is not what you think.

33:01.763 --> 33:02.780
Or what you think.

33:03.809 --> 33:06.230
Somebody hired me
to go out with her daughter.

33:06.910 --> 33:08.803
- You said get a job!
- Somebody hired you?

33:10.541 --> 33:11.824
Your sister, karen.

33:12.299 --> 33:13.299
Aunt karen?

33:14.116 --> 33:16.192
She said she didn't like
Julie's boyfriend so she

33:16.248 --> 33:18.115
paid me $500 to break them up.

33:18.182 --> 33:21.352
- Clay, I don't have a sister.
- No, it's true. I can prove it.

33:21.386 --> 33:23.494
I still got the money. Most of it.

33:24.818 --> 33:28.718
Excuse me. Can I see that? Careful.

33:34.642 --> 33:37.775
This woman, this aunt karen...
What did she look like?

33:38.125 --> 33:40.542
Uh, pretty, long dark hair.

33:40.609 --> 33:41.625
With glasses?

33:41.812 --> 33:42.812
How'd you know?

33:44.181 --> 33:49.615
Natalie I know what's going on.
Julie, the murder...

33:50.381 --> 33:52.056
It's all connected.

34:00.039 --> 34:02.231
- Is this it?
- The bay city pier.

34:02.537 --> 34:05.744
- Who are all these people?
- I don't know, Mr. Monk.

34:07.978 --> 34:10.687
- Who's he?
- I don't know, Mr. Monk.

34:10.837 --> 34:12.976
Is he bothering you?
You want me to ask him to leave?

34:13.010 --> 34:15.331
You better not. He might get mad.

34:15.494 --> 34:18.202
The Captain will be here any minute.
Maybe we should just wait here.

34:18.235 --> 34:19.418
Mrs. Teeger!

34:20.085 --> 34:21.629
Mrs. Teeger, what are you doing here?

34:22.657 --> 34:24.014
Hey, right here!

34:26.810 --> 34:29.514
Hey, you guys, what are you doing here?
Is Julie here?

34:29.547 --> 34:30.746
No, we're here on a job.

34:30.781 --> 34:32.469
You might want
to give her a call though,

34:32.540 --> 34:34.793
because I'm pretty sure
she's gonna break up with Clay.

34:34.818 --> 34:37.889
- She is? Did she say that?
- No, not yet.

34:37.960 --> 34:39.909
- Can I tell him?
- I don't think you should.

34:39.956 --> 34:41.964
- I'm gonna tell him.
- Why do you bother asking?

34:42.034 --> 34:44.049
Clay Bridges never liked Julie.
Not really.

34:44.065 --> 34:47.565
- Somebody paid him to go out with her.
- Somebody paid him?

34:47.699 --> 34:48.801
Who?

34:50.210 --> 34:51.210
He did.

34:53.143 --> 34:54.143
Mr. Sherman?

34:54.203 --> 34:55.308
What's he doing here?

34:55.562 --> 34:58.078
- He's not here to play skeeball.
- I better follow him.

34:58.800 --> 35:00.538
Stay here and wait for the Captain.

35:48.595 --> 35:49.795
Julie's t-shirt?

35:49.828 --> 35:51.620
That's what this whole thing
has been about.

35:51.655 --> 35:53.896
Her t-shirt? I don't understand.

35:54.013 --> 35:58.200
Tim, I've been waiting a long time
to say this. Here's what happened.

35:58.539 --> 36:00.223
We know Dewey Jordan has been here.

36:00.289 --> 36:02.747
Mr. Monk noticed some game coupons
in his apartment.

36:03.032 --> 36:06.437
Mr. Sherman and Dewey Jordan met
a couple weeks ago at the courthouse.

36:06.504 --> 36:09.821
Sherman probably told Dewey he was
pulling some kind of insurance scam

36:09.887 --> 36:13.035
but they had to meet again
some place to work out the details.

36:13.139 --> 36:16.024
They met here at the pier.
It was perfect...

36:16.107 --> 36:18.910
Noisy, a big crowd,
nobody would notice them.

36:19.469 --> 36:21.919
I don't understand. What does all
this have to do with Julie?

36:21.969 --> 36:25.440
It was the same day you and Julie
were here getting your picture taken.

36:35.223 --> 36:39.006
That's where Mr. Monk had seen them
together. On Julie's t-shirt.

36:39.065 --> 36:41.589
They were in the background
the whole time.

36:44.407 --> 36:46.582
That's why he was acting so
weird that day we met him.

36:46.618 --> 36:49.332
When Mr. Sherman saw that t-shirt
he knew he was in trouble.

36:49.416 --> 36:52.554
He saw Julie hanging out
with Mr. Monk, the Captain, and randy.

36:52.587 --> 36:54.837
It was only a matter of time
before somebody noticed it.

36:54.871 --> 36:56.854
I know, but why didn't he
just try to steal it?

36:56.904 --> 36:58.004
Much too risky.

36:58.097 --> 36:59.987
Remember, he didn't have
to destroy the shirt.

37:00.037 --> 37:01.969
He just wanted Julie to stop wearing it.

37:02.069 --> 37:04.436
So he had his girlfriend contact Clay.

37:04.525 --> 37:07.686
- She pretended to be Julie's aunt.
- I get it.

37:07.886 --> 37:10.287
Julie breaks up with me and
she never wears the shirt again.

37:10.353 --> 37:13.170
She's right, you are pretty smart.
That's why we're here.

37:13.223 --> 37:14.773
The Captain's getting a search warrant.

37:14.823 --> 37:17.407
The photo booth keeps backup
copies of all the pictures.

37:18.377 --> 37:21.679
Uh, copy... Why do you need a copy?
Where's the t-shirt?

37:21.748 --> 37:22.748
Julie burned it.

37:22.872 --> 37:24.155
She what? sorry.

39:22.987 --> 39:24.795
Guess you can't win them all,
detective, huh?

39:33.812 --> 39:36.104
- Tim!
- You okay?

39:36.696 --> 39:38.371
I got them.

39:38.929 --> 39:40.488
That's Julie boyfriend.

39:42.335 --> 39:43.813
He's on the swim team.

39:49.164 --> 39:50.614
Thanks, Tim!

39:55.376 --> 39:56.576
Back up disc.

39:56.820 --> 39:58.226
And I printed off a copy.

39:59.877 --> 40:04.891
Well, you and your friend take
a very nice, very incriminating picture.

40:05.084 --> 40:06.451
I put it on a mug too.

40:07.472 --> 40:08.488
What for?

40:08.518 --> 40:10.084
I figured the jury would appreciate it.

40:10.251 --> 40:11.547
They're human, the get thirsty.

40:12.030 --> 40:13.630
Exhibit a, thank you very much.

40:15.352 --> 40:16.635
Mmm... Guilty.

40:19.156 --> 40:20.539
How are you guys doing?

40:21.090 --> 40:22.140
I think we're okay.

40:22.190 --> 40:24.332
We were just listening to the news.
You're a hero.

40:24.342 --> 40:25.772
I don't feel like a hero.

40:25.910 --> 40:28.473
- Well, you are.
- Thanks, mrs. Teeger.

40:28.961 --> 40:30.828
Tim and I are gonna
hang out here for a while.

40:31.030 --> 40:32.138
I mean, if that's okay.

40:32.279 --> 40:33.729
Sure, go ahead. have fun.

40:33.825 --> 40:34.825
Have fun.

40:36.879 --> 40:38.827
What... What's that for?

40:39.160 --> 40:40.443
Our little talk.

40:44.274 --> 40:45.390
Wipe.

40:45.734 --> 40:47.134
- No.
- Natalie.

40:47.301 --> 40:48.946
No, that one stays on.

40:49.279 --> 40:51.562
- For how long?
- Maybe forever.

40:51.822 --> 40:53.600
- I can feel it.
- Good.

40:53.646 --> 40:55.975
Come on, I'm not gonna wipe it off.
I'm just gonna dab it.

40:56.031 --> 40:57.114
You.
