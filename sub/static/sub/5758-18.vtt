WEBVTT

00:00.990 --> 00:03.314
- Previously on pretty little liars.
- You Aria?

00:02.498 --> 00:04.598
- Not now, Wes.
- And that was?

00:05.648 --> 00:07.254
That's Wesley. My brother.

00:08.815 --> 00:10.027
How long have you known?

00:13.116 --> 00:15.631
It's for you. I don't know
a James family in Chicago.

00:15.632 --> 00:17.292
Wasn't that Nate's real name?

00:17.564 --> 00:19.779
And this is definitely
Alison's handwriting.

00:19.780 --> 00:21.635
"You need to tell the
beach hottie tonight."

00:21.636 --> 00:22.657
What are they talking about?

00:22.658 --> 00:25.444
Who is the beach hottie?
Ali never told me.

00:25.445 --> 00:27.509
Just tell me that there's
more to this story,

00:27.510 --> 00:29.586
that's there's something
that I don't know.

00:29.806 --> 00:31.055
Please, Toby!

00:31.657 --> 00:33.348
I'm late. Have you told him?

00:33.349 --> 00:35.176
If he finds out, he's gonna kill me.

00:35.462 --> 00:37.479
Are you okay? I'm about to meet my son.

00:39.527 --> 00:41.866
What does this go to? That's what
I would like you to find out.

00:41.867 --> 00:44.591
And if you follow him,
he'll lead you there.

00:45.248 --> 00:47.660
Emily... you did the right thing.

00:47.661 --> 00:48.227
What's wrong?

00:49.336 --> 00:50.980
Look who else was in cape bay.

00:56.677 --> 00:57.351
Nothing?

00:58.919 --> 01:00.211
Nothing since he left.

01:00.803 --> 01:02.959
Well, he sent an "I got here" text.

01:03.409 --> 01:04.430
Well, that counts...

01:05.069 --> 01:05.966
If you want it to.

01:07.161 --> 01:08.528
I mean, I know he's doing the right thing,

01:08.529 --> 01:11.173
it's just the idea that
something's happening

01:11.174 --> 01:13.395
hundreds of Miles away that's
gonna change everything.

01:19.810 --> 01:22.331
This is cold. I'm just
gonna go get a refill.

01:24.142 --> 01:26.224
Do you think Wilden read
that notebook by now?

01:26.884 --> 01:27.710
He must have.

01:28.270 --> 01:29.600
So he knows what we know.

01:30.251 --> 01:31.874
And what exactly do we know?

01:32.836 --> 01:34.421
It's just Cece's version of things.

01:35.150 --> 01:36.698
There was a picture of him in cape bay.

01:37.599 --> 01:39.438
I'm going back to the police
station after school,

01:39.751 --> 01:41.110
take a snap of it on my phone.

01:52.704 --> 01:53.660
Thanks.

01:54.577 --> 01:55.414
Spencer.

01:56.424 --> 01:57.491
Hey. Jason.

01:58.057 --> 01:59.176
I've got some news.

02:00.009 --> 02:01.282
We're keeping this kind of quiet,

02:01.283 --> 02:04.327
but they've released Ali's
remains to my family.

02:05.144 --> 02:07.730
There's gonna be a re-interment.
She's being buried again?

02:07.731 --> 02:10.019
Not in the ground. In the mausoleum.

02:10.588 --> 02:12.292
There'll be a service, family only,

02:12.293 --> 02:14.346
but I've arranged for you

02:14.347 --> 02:17.308
guys to have some time
after my parents leave.

02:17.886 --> 02:19.290
Thank you. There's something else.

02:20.724 --> 02:24.119
The things we put in the casket
with Ali, they're still missing.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.661
The state police think
whoever opened the grave

02:26.662 --> 02:29.406
is keeping them as some
kind of sick souvenirs.

02:29.971 --> 02:31.570
The cops figure when they find those,

02:31.571 --> 02:33.073
they'll find the creeps who did this.

02:33.654 --> 02:34.811
I think they're right.

02:37.244 --> 02:39.007
Look, I just wanted you
guys to hear it from me.

02:39.590 --> 02:40.308
I'll text you when I know

02:40.309 --> 02:42.039
the details about saying good-bye to Ali.

02:42.040 --> 02:45.319
Don't bother. I've said all the
good-byes I want to say.

02:45.909 --> 02:47.533
Spencer. What?

02:47.797 --> 02:49.262
She's Saint Ali now?

02:49.424 --> 02:51.150
Are her bones fully relics or something?

02:51.151 --> 02:52.548
You need to dial it back.

02:52.549 --> 02:53.958
No, you dial it back.

02:53.959 --> 02:55.633
I'm finished with all of this.

02:56.191 --> 02:58.678
You guys want to pay a visit to
the crypt keeper, that's fine,

02:58.679 --> 03:00.792
it's your business, but keep me out of it!

03:09.597 --> 03:10.421
We'll be there.

03:28.075 --> 03:32.975
<font color="#40bfff">Sync by YYeTS</font> <font color="#40bfff">Corrections by
<font color="#FFA500">wilson0804</font></font> <font color="#40bfff">www.Addic7ed.com</font>

03:33.437 --> 03:34.830
Me and you are the only ones

03:34.831 --> 03:37.037
- with something from Ali's casket.
- I know.

03:37.531 --> 03:38.555
So I say we get rid of them.

03:38.808 --> 03:40.092
I'll ditch the ouija board thingie,

03:40.093 --> 03:41.370
and then you chuck those earrings.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.660
I'm not sure about that.
Not sure about what?

03:43.958 --> 03:45.688
Every time we react to something like this

03:45.689 --> 03:47.430
it comes back to bite us on the ass.

03:47.700 --> 03:49.104
It's like we're being

03:49.105 --> 03:51.397
maneuvered into doing the
absolute wrong thing.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.742
I don't want to end up back
in an orange jumpsuit again.

03:53.743 --> 03:54.863
You think that I do?

03:55.153 --> 03:57.036
Believe me, one size does not fit all.

03:57.292 --> 03:58.284
So what do we do?

03:59.736 --> 04:01.777
I'm gonna go to Ezra's
apartment after school,

04:01.778 --> 04:03.134
so we'll just talk later.

04:04.144 --> 04:05.412
Why are you going to Ezra's?

04:06.531 --> 04:08.848
Because I... Water the
plants, stuff like that.

04:10.260 --> 04:11.796
Oh. And do you do that
while wearing his shirt?

04:12.056 --> 04:13.111
I'm going now.

04:24.341 --> 04:25.406
Morning, Spencer.

04:28.374 --> 04:30.457
Okay, someone's in a mood.

04:31.350 --> 04:32.277
I just came by to remind

04:32.278 --> 04:34.343
you that the decathlon's only a week away.

04:34.925 --> 04:37.701
So in here is your schedule,

04:37.702 --> 04:39.735
hotel information, practice questions,

04:39.994 --> 04:41.209
and permission slip.

04:46.901 --> 04:48.297
Look, Spencer...

04:49.075 --> 04:50.594
I know this is a touchy subject,

04:50.595 --> 04:52.845
but as team Captain, I have to tell you

04:53.591 --> 04:55.249
you've been off your a-game lately.

04:57.507 --> 05:01.116
Yeah. This is the biggest
competition of the year,

05:01.117 --> 05:03.767
and I can't let your slip-and-slide
affect the whole team.

05:04.816 --> 05:06.960
Let me make something clear to you, Mona.

05:07.526 --> 05:10.601
This is not a game to me... at all.

05:11.071 --> 05:14.592
Good. Because I'd hate to see poor Toby

05:14.593 --> 05:16.353
travel all that way for you

05:16.922 --> 05:18.924
only to be left cheering for me.

05:39.305 --> 05:39.935
Caleb.

05:40.107 --> 05:41.734
Hey. From my mom.

05:42.886 --> 05:43.860
Is everything okay?

05:44.639 --> 05:45.425
Yeah, she's fine,

05:45.426 --> 05:46.380
it's just, uh...

05:47.542 --> 05:48.714
I don't know, it's weird.

05:49.749 --> 05:50.460
What is?

05:50.969 --> 05:52.199
My aunt moved to Australia.

05:52.435 --> 05:53.429
What's weird about that?

05:54.993 --> 05:56.591
It's my father's sister.

05:57.542 --> 05:58.793
The one my mom left me with.

05:59.599 --> 06:01.266
The one who put you in foster care?

06:02.246 --> 06:04.715
I guess my mom started looking for
all of her broken connections,

06:04.716 --> 06:07.292
and she finally found my aunt,

06:07.293 --> 06:08.914
and my aunt is moving to brisbane.

06:09.416 --> 06:10.651
They're closing her house.

06:11.199 --> 06:12.818
Wait. The one you were
in when you were little?

06:13.663 --> 06:17.195
Yeah. They're cleaning
it out, tearing it down.

06:17.779 --> 06:20.450
My mom said if I want to see the place,

06:20.721 --> 06:21.942
see if I want anything from it,

06:21.943 --> 06:24.362
I should... I should go now.

06:25.715 --> 06:26.943
Are you thinking about going?

06:29.533 --> 06:32.390
No. I'm not thinking about
it, and I'm not going.

06:32.761 --> 06:34.659
Caleb, if they tear it down...
I don't care.

06:35.673 --> 06:36.552
Let 'em.

06:58.719 --> 06:59.231
Hi.

07:00.124 --> 07:00.943
Hi.

07:01.510 --> 07:03.251
I, uh, I didn't know anyone would be here.

07:04.447 --> 07:06.046
Is Ezra back? No, he's not.

07:06.047 --> 07:07.200
I was just checking on his place.

07:09.029 --> 07:09.869
Oh. Come in.

07:10.811 --> 07:11.574
Thanks.

07:14.446 --> 07:16.452
Ezra said I could use the
place if he was away.

07:19.322 --> 07:20.898
You knew that he was gone.

07:21.520 --> 07:23.060
He called me on his way to Delaware.

07:23.674 --> 07:24.573
He was a little vague about

07:24.574 --> 07:26.088
how he found out about Maggie and Malcolm.

07:26.382 --> 07:28.002
It wasn't vague, it was messy.

07:29.736 --> 07:31.266
But the point is, he found out.

07:31.527 --> 07:33.315
I should have taken the hit. No. It...

07:33.804 --> 07:36.404
look, he knows, he went there,

07:37.712 --> 07:38.855
and now he's talking to her.

07:39.776 --> 07:42.637
So, do we have a problem, me staying
here for a couple of nights?

07:42.824 --> 07:44.147
What? No.

07:45.301 --> 07:46.819
Don't you have classes, though?

07:47.051 --> 07:49.855
No. They're, uh, fumigating the dorms.

07:50.150 --> 07:52.271
First time since the
Clinton administration.

07:54.955 --> 07:55.836
Stay.

07:57.427 --> 07:58.817
I mean, Ezra invited you.

08:00.601 --> 08:02.383
That way I don't have to
worry about the plants.

08:02.928 --> 08:04.822
Okay. Thanks.

08:06.269 --> 08:08.509
Okay. Well, I will get out of your way.

08:18.318 --> 08:20.089
Maybe you should still check the plants.

08:20.779 --> 08:24.225
I mean, I'm not too good about that.
I once killed a cactus.

08:24.546 --> 08:26.548
I thought the only way you
could do that was with a gun.

08:29.200 --> 08:30.114
Okay.

08:30.965 --> 08:33.597
Yeah, um, I'll call before I stop by.

08:35.063 --> 08:35.828
Bye.

08:38.861 --> 08:40.817
Four days ago, the kid bought a sandwich,

08:40.818 --> 08:42.629
thank of gas, and hydrangeas.

08:42.912 --> 08:44.555
Hydrangeas? Yeah.

08:44.834 --> 08:46.849
Sixty-five dollars of hydrangeas.

08:48.035 --> 08:49.236
You know this...?

08:49.969 --> 08:51.124
I'm tracking his credit card.

08:51.761 --> 08:53.612
Okay, what about three days ago?

08:54.421 --> 08:56.234
Three days ago he switched to cash.

08:56.521 --> 08:58.872
Someday he'll run out and I'll
start tracking him again.

08:58.873 --> 09:00.553
Do you want to hear about the key? Yeah.

09:01.157 --> 09:02.867
This wasn't easy, but I

09:02.868 --> 09:05.278
traced the numerical code
to the manufacturer,

09:05.601 --> 09:09.124
manufacturer to a series of buildings
on the West Side of town...

09:09.125 --> 09:09.861
And?

09:11.035 --> 09:13.985
And if you want me to narrow
it to a single doorway,

09:13.986 --> 09:17.208
I'll need a bit more... encouragement.

09:21.887 --> 09:23.282
You're wondering if it's worth it?

09:24.596 --> 09:26.390
No. Not "it."

09:27.591 --> 09:28.308
You.

09:33.495 --> 09:36.034
Can I give you a piece
of professional advice?

09:36.721 --> 09:38.945
My line of work, the people I follow...

09:39.514 --> 09:42.824
criminals. Scumbags, lowlifes, all of 'em.

09:43.745 --> 09:44.950
Okay, so?

09:45.247 --> 09:48.687
So never once have any of
those guys bought hydrangeas

09:48.961 --> 09:50.144
before skipping town.

09:52.558 --> 09:54.062
You let me know about the key.

10:12.983 --> 10:13.761
Emily?

10:16.291 --> 10:17.640
What are you doing here, honey?

10:17.898 --> 10:20.240
I thought I'd see if you wanted
me to grab something for dinner.

10:20.525 --> 10:23.755
Oh! Yes, please. I had
corn nuts for lunch.

10:24.358 --> 10:26.398
From a vending machine? Yeah.

10:26.693 --> 10:28.362
I mistook it for actual food.

10:28.363 --> 10:30.488
Like, say, corn or nuts?

10:31.683 --> 10:33.048
I'm just gonna get my wallet.

10:43.372 --> 10:45.092
You know what? Change of plans.

10:46.595 --> 10:48.979
Let's just go out to dinner.
I'll clock out early.

10:50.158 --> 10:51.184
Are you sure that's okay?

10:51.991 --> 10:53.114
What are they gonna do, arrest me?

10:56.999 --> 10:58.359
Where did this come from?

10:59.095 --> 11:02.772
Oh. Uh, that's mine. I left it
on the counter this morning.

11:03.202 --> 11:04.689
You must have put it in
your bag by accident.

11:04.983 --> 11:07.347
All right, well, let me go sign out.

11:07.348 --> 11:08.304
I'll be right back.

11:26.882 --> 11:27.560
He was gone.

11:27.793 --> 11:28.739
Wilden read the notebook.

11:28.740 --> 11:29.695
He knows we're onto him.

11:33.597 --> 11:36.212
What exactly brings you to my office?

11:38.409 --> 11:40.769
Look, I know you're in a funk, okay?

11:40.770 --> 11:42.886
I was the first one to
hear about your break-up.

11:42.987 --> 11:45.159
And I didn't tell anyone
until I knew you were ready.

11:46.274 --> 11:48.777
I'm on your side here. I know.

11:53.176 --> 11:54.825
Is this what you left in Ali's casket?

11:55.426 --> 11:57.664
That and twenty-four other postcards.

11:58.366 --> 12:00.028
Someone put this in my mom's bag.

12:01.405 --> 12:02.355
Aria thought it was bad

12:02.356 --> 12:04.177
getting those earrings
back one at a time...

12:05.241 --> 12:07.746
"a" has twenty-five
opportunities to set me up.

12:16.522 --> 12:17.883
Does that mean he murdered Ali?

12:17.884 --> 12:19.310
Or that he's part of "A's" entourage?

12:19.409 --> 12:20.729
That is not what this message says.

12:22.315 --> 12:25.107
"LA police" are "capable de murder."

12:25.865 --> 12:27.042
I took French, Spencer.

12:27.541 --> 12:28.738
For a semester.

12:30.390 --> 12:31.524
"Arrete de creuser.

12:31.882 --> 12:33.424
"LA police sait deja que c'est toi

12:33.425 --> 12:34.924
qui est capable de meurtre."

12:35.569 --> 12:37.447
Translation: "Stop digging."

12:38.247 --> 12:40.669
"The police already know it's you

12:40.922 --> 12:42.001
who is capable of murder."

12:42.571 --> 12:45.685
Wow. That sounded so
much better in French.

12:48.284 --> 12:48.935
They mean Nate.

12:48.936 --> 12:50.957
Look, you didn't do anything wrong.

12:51.498 --> 12:53.113
Okay? Even the police know that.

12:54.307 --> 12:56.839
Emily, that freak was
gonna kill you and Paige.

12:57.806 --> 12:58.993
Thank you for the French lesson.

12:59.512 --> 13:01.049
I ha to go to work soon, so....

13:01.966 --> 13:02.547
Emily.

13:11.838 --> 13:13.144
I meant to throw that out already.

13:19.947 --> 13:20.469
That too.

13:26.323 --> 13:28.314
I don't know what happened
with you and Toby...

13:30.322 --> 13:31.920
And I know you're not
ready to talk about it.

13:32.374 --> 13:35.156
But I am here for you.
We're all here for you.

13:35.951 --> 13:37.606
You can't just push us away that easily.

13:39.220 --> 13:41.941
Last week Hanna saw Paige
with another girl.

13:42.973 --> 13:44.181
She assumed the worst.

13:44.625 --> 13:46.619
She thought that Paige
was seeing someone else.

13:47.849 --> 13:48.432
She wasn't.

13:49.858 --> 13:52.262
I talked to her, and she was
trying to help us figure out

13:52.263 --> 13:54.562
who bought that queen of
hearts costume on Halloween.

13:56.383 --> 13:59.629
The girl that Hanna was so worried
about works at a costume shop.

14:01.167 --> 14:03.648
She was a flirt, not a threat.

14:04.983 --> 14:07.777
Did she find out who bought it? Not yet.

14:08.591 --> 14:12.082
The point is, sometimes things
look bad, and they're really not.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.754
Sometimes there's another
explanation for what's going on.

14:16.522 --> 14:18.823
And what if that
explanation is even worse?

14:21.859 --> 14:23.444
So what's he like? The brother.

14:24.403 --> 14:27.231
He's all right. A little bit
full of himself, though.

14:27.862 --> 14:28.504
Is he cute?

14:29.997 --> 14:30.969
He's kinda cute.

14:32.381 --> 14:33.994
He's just way too comfortable

14:33.995 --> 14:35.599
living off of his trust fund, though.

14:35.677 --> 14:37.818
I would not mind getting
cozy with one of those.

14:39.509 --> 14:40.204
Trust fund.

14:40.877 --> 14:42.863
Look, I gotta go. I gotta
make Caleb dinner.

14:43.617 --> 14:46.158
Huh-ho! So is that how you bribed

14:46.159 --> 14:48.148
Caleb into going out to his
aunt's house tomorrow?

14:48.408 --> 14:50.424
A little. I just explained that

14:50.425 --> 14:51.953
this might be his only
chance to say good-bye.

14:53.195 --> 14:56.075
Hey, give me the earrings.
I'll take them tonight.

14:56.384 --> 14:58.566
Um, I'm not ready to do that.

14:59.290 --> 15:00.183
Well, you don't have to.

15:00.648 --> 15:01.939
I'll get rid of them with
the ouija board piece.

15:01.940 --> 15:04.745
Okay, you can do whatever you
want, but I'm gonna wait.

15:05.501 --> 15:06.845
Look Aria, you're making a mistake.

15:07.363 --> 15:08.375
Well, it's my mistake.

15:17.288 --> 15:18.163
Is this a new couch?

15:18.898 --> 15:21.542
It's a rental. Just about
everything here is.

15:22.295 --> 15:24.301
I wanted to make a fresh
start in a new office.

15:24.864 --> 15:26.150
I'm here until I find the right one.

15:28.007 --> 15:30.417
I don't officially start
seeing people until next week.

15:30.689 --> 15:31.957
Well, thanks for letting me come in.

15:35.055 --> 15:35.945
Mona's back at school.

15:37.171 --> 15:39.587
Like you said, therapy and the right meds

15:39.588 --> 15:41.253
and she'd be ready to rejoin society.

15:42.979 --> 15:44.376
Did you come here to talk about Mona?

15:45.748 --> 15:46.561
I came because...

15:49.053 --> 15:51.145
Not talking isn't working.

15:56.018 --> 15:57.403
You may have heard I killed a guy.

15:58.632 --> 16:01.461
I heard that you and a classmate
were attacked by someone,

16:02.013 --> 16:03.523
the same person who killed Maya.

16:05.335 --> 16:08.668
You were defending yourself, Emily.
What you did was incredibly...

16:08.669 --> 16:11.322
Dr. Sullivan, no. That's not what I said.

16:12.010 --> 16:13.308
That's not what I want to talk about.

16:14.931 --> 16:17.336
Everyone wants to talk about
how I'm some kind of hero.

16:18.291 --> 16:19.358
Everyone tells me I...

16:23.113 --> 16:24.287
I killed someone.

16:25.301 --> 16:26.499
Someone had a life,

16:27.205 --> 16:29.404
someone was a living, breathing person,

16:29.405 --> 16:30.201
and I...

16:32.565 --> 16:33.703
you killed someone.

16:35.426 --> 16:37.138
I know what he was planning to do,

16:38.341 --> 16:39.193
who he really was.

16:41.123 --> 16:41.996
In my head, I know.

16:45.761 --> 16:49.332
But then I close my eyes
and I can see myself...

16:50.650 --> 16:51.799
Holding that knife...

16:53.797 --> 16:54.831
It was in my han

16:55.755 --> 16:58.137
and I can still feel what
it felt like when it...

17:01.705 --> 17:03.726
Emily, have you ever thought
about trying hypnotherapy?

17:05.464 --> 17:07.646
I remember what happened, Dr. Sullivan.

17:08.808 --> 17:11.923
That's the problem... I remember
exactly what happened.

17:11.999 --> 17:13.154
Hypnotherapy isn't just

17:13.155 --> 17:15.227
about bringing back
memories we've repressed.

17:15.779 --> 17:18.041
Sometimes it's about
re-framing the ones we have,

17:18.891 --> 17:20.452
the ones that are controlling our lives,

17:21.278 --> 17:23.132
controlling the way we see ourselves.

17:31.085 --> 17:32.346
How soon can we start?

18:34.085 --> 18:36.354
Hello? Hi. It's Spencer.

18:37.601 --> 18:40.397
Um, how much more
"encouragement" do you need?

18:41.318 --> 18:42.475
Five hundred...

18:44.165 --> 18:45.073
Cash.

18:46.206 --> 18:48.477
Fine. Keep looking.

19:12.503 --> 19:14.734
You're looking at about a
hundred years' worth of stuff.

19:16.192 --> 19:17.617
Did you grow up here, Mr. Doyle?

19:18.369 --> 19:19.598
Jamie. Yeah, I did.

19:20.489 --> 19:22.377
My sister Patty, Caleb's aunt,

19:22.378 --> 19:22.968
stayed and took care of

19:22.969 --> 19:25.519
our folks when they got old.
I was long gone.

19:26.535 --> 19:27.982
And so was Caleb's dad?

19:29.136 --> 19:30.186
Yeah. He was gone too.

19:32.024 --> 19:33.731
Patty was surprised to hear from your mom.

19:35.240 --> 19:36.179
Yeah, I bet she was.

19:44.316 --> 19:45.468
Are you being rude on purpose?

19:46.225 --> 19:46.776
I just don't want to be

19:46.777 --> 19:48.571
here all day going
through this crap, okay?

19:48.768 --> 19:50.891
Well, at least look at the stuff
before you throw it away.

19:58.407 --> 20:00.016
How long has it been since
you've seen your Uncle?

20:00.957 --> 20:01.865
A long time.

20:02.273 --> 20:04.606
I only saw him like once or
twice a year when I was a kid.

20:04.821 --> 20:06.746
Took me to a few Phillies games.

20:07.294 --> 20:08.663
That must have been nice.

20:09.278 --> 20:11.865
He just felt guilty that
his brother ran out on me.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.420
That's a decent chunk of change.

20:24.150 --> 20:26.610
The other girls are coming by the
cemetery tonight around seven.

20:26.611 --> 20:28.294
Sounds like a real party.

20:29.810 --> 20:31.420
Hey, what is your problem, Spencer?

20:31.421 --> 20:33.087
You got a prior engagement or something?

20:33.088 --> 20:34.661
She was your best friend.

20:38.969 --> 20:40.565
Look, if you got something to say, say it.

20:40.566 --> 20:42.728
You don't want to have
this fight with me, Jason.

20:43.026 --> 20:46.765
Not now. I'll win, and it won't
feel good for either of us.

20:53.326 --> 20:56.170
No! Wait. You can donate
these books to a library.

20:56.469 --> 20:58.169
Come on, they're all moldy.

20:58.170 --> 21:01.143
I used to love picture books.
I might want to keep 'em.

21:08.658 --> 21:11.742
Uh, if you happen to find Mike
mulligan's steam shovel in there,

21:11.743 --> 21:12.888
I'll take it.

21:12.996 --> 21:13.897
Deal.

21:17.427 --> 21:19.203
He turned into a good-looking young man.

21:22.979 --> 21:24.077
He treat you right?

21:25.982 --> 21:26.937
He does.

21:28.547 --> 21:29.445
Good.

21:32.437 --> 21:34.262
Do you ever hear from his father?

21:35.359 --> 21:38.353
Uh... Nobody does.

21:40.094 --> 21:43.047
It's no great loss. He's not
the sort of man people miss.

21:43.976 --> 21:46.403
Caleb's never really
talked about family much,

21:47.003 --> 21:47.970
and then his mom found him,

21:47.971 --> 21:51.505
and it kind of... changed things.

21:52.181 --> 21:53.584
I'm glad she found him.

21:54.481 --> 21:57.574
I've never met her. Did you know her?

21:59.272 --> 22:02.217
Yes. Uh... she deserved better.

22:03.777 --> 22:05.574
Most people deserve better than they get.

22:06.652 --> 22:10.518
So you saw them together?
Caleb's mom and dad.

22:11.062 --> 22:12.000
Yeah.

22:12.608 --> 22:14.084
Did they love each other?

22:15.340 --> 22:16.796
Even for a little while?

22:18.179 --> 22:19.206
I think so.

22:20.097 --> 22:21.769
Then why would he leave them?

22:23.314 --> 22:26.794
Yeah... He said he needed some space.

22:28.277 --> 22:32.168
Figured he'd come back when
he could handle being a dad.

22:34.439 --> 22:36.977
The thing is, when you walk
out, the people you leave...

22:38.043 --> 22:39.782
They keep on having a life.

22:40.328 --> 22:41.906
They don't wait for you to come back.

22:54.522 --> 22:57.986
You're in a safe space, Emily.
No one can harm you here.

22:58.638 --> 23:01.887
When I tell you to wake up,
you will remember everything,

23:02.129 --> 23:04.295
then you will tell me what you remember.

23:04.674 --> 23:06.032
Okay, wake up.

23:08.858 --> 23:11.590
I want you to tell me everything
that happened that night.

23:11.614 --> 23:14.248
That night. At the lighthouse.

23:14.812 --> 23:16.668
You and your friend were in danger.

23:17.511 --> 23:20.223
Are you there now? Yes.

23:20.677 --> 23:21.667
Good.

23:26.963 --> 23:29.356
Hey. The plants have been
calling out for you.

23:29.363 --> 23:32.095
I know, I heard them crying for
me all the way down the hall.

23:33.829 --> 23:35.188
Have you heard from him?

23:35.533 --> 23:39.046
No. That doesn't mean he
isn't thinking about you.

23:39.047 --> 23:40.722
Yeah? What does it mean?

23:46.003 --> 23:47.288
Are you gonna get that?

23:50.290 --> 23:51.827
Probably just a junk call.

23:52.223 --> 23:54.422
No, it could be Ezra. He
knows that you're here.

23:59.781 --> 24:00.715
Hello.

24:10.155 --> 24:11.245
Wrong number.

24:13.583 --> 24:14.803
Hey, you hungry?

24:15.326 --> 24:16.565
Yeah, I guess so.

24:16.652 --> 24:18.956
All right, come on. I
need some air anyway.

24:19.656 --> 24:20.690
Okay.

24:28.151 --> 24:29.668
Tell me what you see.

24:32.197 --> 24:33.336
I'm walking...

24:34.823 --> 24:36.272
I don't know where I am.

24:37.106 --> 24:38.218
It's dark...

24:39.016 --> 24:40.147
Really dark.

24:40.651 --> 24:43.544
Take a look around, Emily.
Do you see the lighthouse?

24:44.781 --> 24:46.705
Someone just turned on the sprinklers.

24:48.650 --> 24:52.604
Is there anyone else there with you?
I see her.

24:52.605 --> 24:53.985
You see Paige?

24:57.399 --> 25:01.199
She's looking at me. I think
she knows she's gonna die.

25:02.257 --> 25:03.654
We shouldn't be here.

25:04.072 --> 25:06.429
This is bad. We shouldn't be doing this.

25:06.568 --> 25:07.805
Oh, my God.

25:08.581 --> 25:10.481
No! Please, no!

25:10.482 --> 25:12.019
Tell me what you see.

25:12.251 --> 25:13.300
I'd like to wake up now!

25:13.301 --> 25:16.832
Emily, you're in a safe space.
Tell me what you see.

25:18.700 --> 25:19.960
I see...

25:21.157 --> 25:22.512
The murder weapon.

25:25.480 --> 25:27.036
You have to stop!

25:27.907 --> 25:29.848
What do you think you're doing?!

25:30.854 --> 25:32.484
You can't do this!

25:33.996 --> 25:36.262
Stop! Stop!!!

25:36.263 --> 25:38.156
Stop!!!

25:51.685 --> 25:52.829
What happened?

25:53.536 --> 25:55.463
You broke out of the hypnosis.

25:55.464 --> 25:56.927
Do you remember what you saw?

25:57.668 --> 26:00.319
You were talking about Nate,
you saw the murder weapon,

26:00.320 --> 26:02.207
and then you just started yelling.

26:05.742 --> 26:06.762
Emily.

26:07.911 --> 26:08.927
Emily!

26:10.146 --> 26:12.418
Sorry. I have to go.

26:20.212 --> 26:22.479
All right, I'm gonna put this
stuff in the car and we can

26:24.681 --> 26:25.870
bye, Uncle Jamie.

26:26.782 --> 26:27.942
Bye, Caleb.

26:30.861 --> 26:32.781
Thank you, Mr. Doyle.

26:32.967 --> 26:34.765
Or... Jamie.

26:35.134 --> 26:36.116
Yeah.

26:36.275 --> 26:37.971
You sure you kids don't want to

26:38.111 --> 26:40.942
go down the road, get a hamburger?
I'm buying.

26:41.104 --> 26:43.236
I think Caleb really wants to get going.

26:44.201 --> 26:45.144
Right.

26:46.844 --> 26:47.762
Hanna.

26:56.723 --> 26:59.418
I found this over there,
bottom of a dresser.

27:01.336 --> 27:02.642
Look on the back.

27:05.752 --> 27:07.488
"Caleb 6 months."

27:10.191 --> 27:11.068
Yeah.

27:12.754 --> 27:15.971
The way he's feeling, I'm not
sure he'd want it right now,

27:16.020 --> 27:18.241
so maybe you could hold onto it for him.

27:19.544 --> 27:22.714
Just until he wants to see it. Yeah.

27:23.265 --> 27:24.965
Yeah, I will. Thank you.

27:26.595 --> 27:27.595
Hanna.

27:28.122 --> 27:31.151
Um... I've gotta get going.

27:31.636 --> 27:35.827
Yeah. You make sure he takes care of you.

27:38.619 --> 27:39.945
Yeah, he will.

27:52.967 --> 27:55.515
Hey, you've reached Hanna's phone.
Leave a message.

28:22.616 --> 28:24.224
We're supposed to be studying.

28:29.477 --> 28:30.986
Are you planning a trip?

28:32.369 --> 28:34.376
You and me and sweet paree?

28:35.130 --> 28:36.654
How does that sound?

28:38.924 --> 28:42.078
Maybe we should learn how to
parle francai before we go.

28:43.174 --> 28:45.620
Well, we could start in
the South of France,

28:46.368 --> 28:48.523
dancing through sunflower fields,

28:49.625 --> 28:52.795
lounging around in our bikinis
in the French riviera.

28:54.908 --> 28:57.572
You'd look so good on top
of the eiffel tower...

28:58.790 --> 29:00.154
Wind in your hair...

29:11.646 --> 29:13.420
How long are we going away for?

29:20.249 --> 29:21.644
How about forever?

29:27.879 --> 29:30.084
Hey. When'd you get back?

29:30.085 --> 29:31.767
Uh, a little while ago.

29:33.444 --> 29:34.365
Honey?

29:35.425 --> 29:37.469
No. I can't let you do that.

29:37.712 --> 29:40.218
Do what? Act like I'm innocent.

29:40.374 --> 29:43.276
Like I'm still the same sweet
little girl that I've always been.

29:43.428 --> 29:45.841
I'm not. I can't be.

29:46.668 --> 29:49.225
Sweetheart, I know who you are,

29:49.226 --> 29:49.817
and you would never

29:49.818 --> 29:52.767
deliberately do anything
to hurt another person.

29:52.768 --> 29:54.648
I'm not so sure about that anymore.

29:57.137 --> 29:58.163
Emily!

29:58.766 --> 30:00.616
Emily, I am your mother,

30:00.969 --> 30:03.568
and that means that I can
see you, all of you,

30:03.569 --> 30:05.496
sometimes better than
you can see yourself,

30:06.130 --> 30:07.751
and there's only good there.

30:08.013 --> 30:09.311
Look... look at me!

30:10.293 --> 30:14.391
I promise you, there's only good there.

30:28.394 --> 30:30.800
It's a unit in a small
building on Mayflower Hill.

30:34.593 --> 30:36.473
What do you think's
behind the door, Spencer?

30:38.600 --> 30:39.507
I don't know.

30:41.164 --> 30:42.660
Okay, what do you hope is behind the door?

30:47.128 --> 30:50.161
We had a secret, him and me...

30:51.495 --> 30:53.758
And this will tell me whether he kept it.

30:56.507 --> 31:00.365
Did you ever play the game with
the flowers when you were little,

31:00.366 --> 31:01.865
"he loves me, he loves me not"?

31:03.884 --> 31:05.636
He loves me, he loves me not...

31:07.565 --> 31:08.269
The trick is, you just

31:08.270 --> 31:10.201
find a flower with the
odd number of petals.

31:10.202 --> 31:11.085
Buttercups.

31:13.059 --> 31:14.130
Marigolds.

31:15.413 --> 31:17.386
How many petals are on a hydrangea?

31:22.863 --> 31:23.733
So, you...

31:24.800 --> 31:26.063
Open the door, and...

31:26.926 --> 31:27.901
I open the door,

31:27.902 --> 31:30.017
and if it's full of the
things that I think it is,

31:30.018 --> 31:31.405
then it means that there's hope.

31:33.070 --> 31:34.670
That means that he loves me,

31:35.260 --> 31:38.718
and that I wasn't wrong about us.

31:42.958 --> 31:44.521
And if not... if not...

31:47.228 --> 31:48.443
It's time to let him go.

32:01.707 --> 32:03.871
Ezra taught me to drive when I was twelve.

32:03.872 --> 32:06.138
He taught you to drive
when you were twelve?

32:06.536 --> 32:08.688
He said I should learn to
do it right the first time.

32:08.689 --> 32:09.745
Fitzgerald.

32:11.113 --> 32:12.357
I been lookin' for you.

32:13.209 --> 32:15.799
Your mother fixed the board,
but she can't buy me off.

32:15.800 --> 32:17.887
Mr. Kaplan, funny running
into you like this.

32:17.888 --> 32:18.823
Let's see that pretty smile

32:18.824 --> 32:20.743
after I bounce your face off the curb.

32:22.957 --> 32:23.736
Come on!

32:30.757 --> 32:31.527
Wait. Wait.

32:32.053 --> 32:33.142
Who the hell was that?

32:33.716 --> 32:35.155
My physics teacher's husband.

32:35.886 --> 32:37.431
What kind of school do you go to?

32:44.249 --> 32:45.971
Why was the husband of
your physics teacher

32:45.972 --> 32:47.418
trying to *** to you?

32:47.419 --> 32:48.195
If you want to blame somebody,

32:48.196 --> 32:49.526
you can blame my mother.

32:50.112 --> 32:50.945
Oh, I'd love to,

32:50.946 --> 32:53.631
but what exactly would
I be blaming her for?

32:54.114 --> 32:55.144
Ezra taught me how to drive,

32:55.145 --> 32:57.469
but he never taught me how
to get away from our family.

32:59.582 --> 33:02.463
I thought you liked your world.
I thought so too.

33:04.432 --> 33:08.096
When Ezra left home, our
mom was furious. So was I.

33:08.619 --> 33:09.621
It took me a long time to realize

33:09.622 --> 33:11.329
I wasn't angry at him for leaving.

33:11.330 --> 33:13.172
I was pissed because he
didn't take me with him.

33:13.761 --> 33:15.047
Why did you want to go with him?

33:15.623 --> 33:17.514
Because he's not the only one with dreams.

33:18.888 --> 33:21.381
But if I was gonna get free,
I'd have to do it on my own.

33:22.043 --> 33:23.728
So I thought getting
thrown out of prep school

33:23.729 --> 33:24.849
would be a good start.

33:25.217 --> 33:28.074
If I failed enough courses,
broke enough rules...

33:28.075 --> 33:30.899
What happened? My mother made
every infraction disappear

33:30.900 --> 33:32.506
with the wave of her checkbook.

33:33.863 --> 33:35.311
Still brings us back to

33:35.312 --> 33:38.038
the man that you hit
with our leftover pizza.

33:38.333 --> 33:40.674
Yeah, desperate times call
for desperate measures.

33:41.105 --> 33:43.289
I went for the one really
crazy thing I knew

33:43.290 --> 33:45.082
would cause maximum trouble.

33:45.648 --> 33:49.188
You hit on your physics teacher.
Who is very attractive,

33:49.586 --> 33:51.866
in an intellectual cougar sort of way.

33:52.729 --> 33:54.473
Well, did it work?

33:55.458 --> 33:57.881
Academic suspension and an irate husband.

33:58.720 --> 33:59.845
That's why I'm hiding here.

34:01.406 --> 34:03.283
That's the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

34:05.350 --> 34:09.123
Look, before Ezra, my family was
as predictable as the tides.

34:09.543 --> 34:12.085
One day Ezra just had
enough and walked out.

34:12.438 --> 34:14.996
My mom hurled lightning
bolts, but he survived.

34:15.889 --> 34:17.565
And more important, he found you.

34:19.371 --> 34:21.788
He found you and said,
"that's who I want."

34:23.754 --> 34:25.434
You're the most amazing part of this.

34:25.435 --> 34:26.841
That's why my mother hates you.

34:28.408 --> 34:29.126
Why?

34:30.242 --> 34:31.443
Because you're unexpected.

34:36.618 --> 34:37.835
That was a day shot.

34:38.831 --> 34:40.371
I don't really know what
you were expecting.

34:42.326 --> 34:46.025
Just thought that you could
have a chance to... Reconnect.

34:46.989 --> 34:50.650
Well, silence your inner Oprah, okay?
It's just an old house.

34:52.306 --> 34:53.579
Your Uncle was nice.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.005
Yeah, I thought they were all nice,

34:56.005 --> 34:57.463
until they shipped me off.

34:57.464 --> 34:59.106
You could have asked
him why they did that.

34:59.855 --> 35:01.967
Some things you're better off not knowing.

35:02.541 --> 35:03.508
I suppose.

35:05.608 --> 35:07.499
Besides, it wasn't his call, okay?

35:17.056 --> 35:17.829
Caleb...

35:18.649 --> 35:19.705
If I show you something,

35:19.706 --> 35:21.501
can you promise not to get angry?

35:29.081 --> 35:29.918
That's you...

35:31.662 --> 35:32.782
When you were a baby.

35:40.959 --> 35:42.218
Where did you get this?

35:43.081 --> 35:45.447
Your Uncle Jamie gave it to
me when we were leaving.

35:46.753 --> 35:48.997
He wanted to make sure that
you didn't throw it away.

35:52.801 --> 35:55.423
Um... W-where was it?

35:56.525 --> 35:57.706
In the shed someplace?

35:58.742 --> 35:59.664
I don't think so.

36:02.415 --> 36:04.221
You see how the edges are kind of bent?

36:06.940 --> 36:08.591
I think he took it from his wallet.

36:10.580 --> 36:12.410
Why would have a picture
of me in his wallet?

36:14.841 --> 36:16.198
I can think of a reason.

36:21.509 --> 36:23.213
The man holding you...

36:25.017 --> 36:25.894
That ring...

36:29.191 --> 36:31.562
Jamie had the same ring on today.

36:34.177 --> 36:36.166
He knew you before you were five.

36:47.986 --> 36:48.954
Not a chance.

37:03.769 --> 37:05.001
Dr. Sullivan!

37:05.475 --> 37:07.594
I was hoping I'd catch you.

37:07.595 --> 37:09.238
Mona, what are you doing here?

37:09.239 --> 37:10.923
I heard you were reopening your practice,

37:10.924 --> 37:13.068
so I thought I'd come
by and give you this.

37:13.920 --> 37:16.610
It's a housewarming present
for the new office.

37:16.902 --> 37:19.954
And I just wanted you to know
that I'm doing so much better.

37:21.231 --> 37:22.402
I'm glad to hear it.

37:22.959 --> 37:25.310
Oh, what a cute little space!

37:25.311 --> 37:28.695
I bet the orchid would look
great on that windowsill.

37:29.467 --> 37:31.548
I'm actually leaving for a few days,

37:31.549 --> 37:33.953
so I will make sure it gets some water.

37:35.457 --> 37:36.336
Good thinking.

37:37.980 --> 37:39.721
It was very thoughtful of you, Mona.

37:39.722 --> 37:40.829
Oh, it's nothing.

37:41.331 --> 37:44.085
I could never really repay
you for what you did.

37:47.285 --> 37:48.077
Bye.

38:46.734 --> 38:48.897
So shall we just wait, or...?

38:49.964 --> 38:51.448
I'm pretty sure she's not coming.

39:01.262 --> 39:04.644
"Unable are the loved to die,
for love is immortality."

39:05.183 --> 39:09.026
That's creepy. It's Emily Dickinson.

39:09.455 --> 39:11.884
I don't care if it's Santa
Claus, consider me creeped.

39:12.726 --> 39:16.291
It's okay. It is a touch creepy in here.

39:16.677 --> 39:18.518
My parents barely stayed two minutes.

39:21.494 --> 39:23.102
Hey, you okay?

39:25.886 --> 39:27.995
Spencer. You changed your mind.

39:27.996 --> 39:30.595
No. I just knew that I
could find you here.

39:30.596 --> 39:32.826
I do have something to say to you.
Spencer.

39:32.827 --> 39:35.317
Ali was pregnant when she died. What?

39:35.318 --> 39:37.150
What is she talking about? Is this true?

39:37.151 --> 39:39.189
We can't know for sure.
Emily looked it up,

39:39.190 --> 39:41.307
and her early pregnancy wouldn't
have shown up in an autopsy.

39:41.308 --> 39:41.881
Isn't that right, em?

39:41.882 --> 39:43.307
You have no idea what
you're saying right now.

39:43.308 --> 39:45.382
What the hell is wrong with you?
How do you know about this?

39:45.383 --> 39:47.511
I mean, who would she
have... who's the father?

39:47.512 --> 39:50.454
Oh, that's the best part. Who, Spencer?

39:50.455 --> 39:52.289
Spencer, don't. I don't care!

39:52.290 --> 39:54.263
Don't do this. Not here, Spencer.

39:58.033 --> 39:59.258
Detective Wilden.

40:00.096 --> 40:01.519
One of Rosewood's finest.

40:07.474 --> 40:09.966
Please tell me this is part of
some brilliant Spencer plan.

40:09.967 --> 40:10.953
It's not.

40:11.230 --> 40:13.588
She's just hurting and wants
us to hurt just as bad.

40:13.589 --> 40:15.759
We're your friends, we're
not your punching bags.

40:26.682 --> 40:30.294
Okay, so how are we gonna fix this?
What are we telling Jason?

40:30.295 --> 40:33.604
Forget Jason. There's something
really wrong with Spencer.

40:34.005 --> 40:36.825
I mean, this is bigger than Toby leaving.

40:37.290 --> 40:40.216
I'm heartbroken too, but she just seems...

40:40.217 --> 40:40.978
Broken.

40:42.738 --> 40:44.933
It's one thing to doubt
the person you're with...

40:45.629 --> 40:48.009
if they ever loved you, if they didn't...

40:49.014 --> 40:51.611
it's something else entirely when
you start to doubt yourself.

40:55.224 --> 40:56.382
Do you hear that?

40:56.383 --> 40:57.584
You mean the sprinklers?

41:00.376 --> 41:04.357
I heard it that night. Not
in Ali's yard, at her grave.

41:06.661 --> 41:08.273
I mixed up the nightmares.

41:12.956 --> 41:14.336
We shouldn't be here.

41:14.900 --> 41:17.779
This is bad. We shouldn't be doing this.

41:18.393 --> 41:19.658
You have to stop!

41:20.424 --> 41:22.984
What do you think you're doing?!
You can't do this!

41:22.985 --> 41:24.917
Stop! Stop!

41:24.918 --> 41:25.977
Stop!!!

41:28.546 --> 41:31.173
The girl... the girl in the red coat.

41:34.020 --> 41:35.513
It all happened right here.

41:36.501 --> 41:37.548
I didn't hurt her.

41:38.623 --> 41:39.966
Ali? Of course not.

41:39.967 --> 41:40.839
Wait, so this was after

41:40.840 --> 41:42.833
Jenna and Noel picked
you up from the diner?

41:43.228 --> 41:45.437
I don't know. It could have been before.

41:45.847 --> 41:48.209
I know this sounds ridiculous,
but someone has to ask...

41:49.333 --> 41:51.027
do you think it was
Alison in the red coat?

41:51.028 --> 41:53.200
Alison digging up her own grave?

41:53.201 --> 41:55.080
I said it was ridiculous.
And you were right.

41:55.081 --> 41:57.082
All I know is that it was a woman,

41:57.083 --> 41:59.808
she was blond, and she
was wearing a red coat.

41:59.809 --> 42:00.605
And...

42:02.385 --> 42:03.094
What?

42:04.440 --> 42:05.985
She's the one in charge.

43:25.596 --> 43:26.451
Hey, Dave.

43:27.086 --> 43:28.437
Make sure you see an I.D.

43:31.841 --> 43:33.926
I'll get the rest of this
order on the loading dock.
