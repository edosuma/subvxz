WEBVTT

00:03.241 --> 00:04.344
- Previously
on "Hit the Floor"...

00:04.413 --> 00:05.827
- Will you marry me?
- Yes.

00:05.896 --> 00:09.551
- My last boyfriend was stage 4
and didn't tell me.

00:09.620 --> 00:11.482
He was taken from me
without a good-bye.

00:11.551 --> 00:13.000
- There may come
a time when you

00:13.068 --> 00:15.137
could use
my help around here

00:15.206 --> 00:18.068
or I could use yours.
- I'm not what you need.

00:18.137 --> 00:20.137
- You know, when they call
your name out there,

00:20.206 --> 00:22.517
they might not be shouting it
the way you want.

00:24.103 --> 00:25.862
- Go to hell, Pastor.

00:25.931 --> 00:29.034
- You, me, a date?

00:29.103 --> 00:30.517
- I'm not dating
anyone right now.

00:30.586 --> 00:32.896
I'm taking time
to work on myself

00:32.965 --> 00:35.620
and what I need to get done
the rest of this season.

00:35.689 --> 00:37.448
- I never thought
there'd come a time

00:37.517 --> 00:39.310
that I'd feel something again.

00:39.379 --> 00:42.448
- You want to take the shot?
- Yeah.

00:42.517 --> 00:45.344
- I started something,
and I need to see it through.

00:48.896 --> 00:50.758
- Does that offer still stand?

00:50.827 --> 00:52.137
- Come in.

01:13.655 --> 01:16.793
- All right, now.

01:19.586 --> 01:22.344
- Okay.
Now I really should leave.

01:22.413 --> 01:24.586
- Wait, wait, wait.

01:25.413 --> 01:28.310
We don't have
to go separately.

01:28.379 --> 01:30.620
Let's go to the arena together.

01:30.689 --> 01:34.689
- Together, like,
together-together?

01:35.896 --> 01:37.413
- We are, aren't we?

01:45.931 --> 01:48.896
- Kyle didn't want a piece
of next season's dance team.

01:48.965 --> 01:53.758
Well, she didn't want to do
what it took to get it.

01:53.827 --> 01:56.344
You're clearly smarter.

01:56.413 --> 01:59.482
- That's just icing
on the cake.

01:59.551 --> 02:03.655
I'm as motivated as you are
to do some damage.

02:05.310 --> 02:06.448
And the Devils
are getting closer

02:06.517 --> 02:08.965
to winning the title, so...

02:09.034 --> 02:10.137
what's the plan?

02:10.206 --> 02:12.344
- For reasons
I won't get into,

02:12.413 --> 02:15.448
my badge has been deactivated
at the arena.

02:15.517 --> 02:17.655
I won't be at today's game.

02:17.724 --> 02:20.448
But I can operate
inside the arena

02:20.517 --> 02:22.241
with a different set of hands.

02:22.310 --> 02:24.413
- What do you want me to do?

02:24.482 --> 02:26.172
- I've been given
some information.

02:26.241 --> 02:28.413
I haven't been able
to do anything with it

02:28.482 --> 02:30.689
because I have no proof.

02:31.827 --> 02:33.689
You could get it for me.

02:33.758 --> 02:35.344
- What information?

02:35.413 --> 02:39.724
- It involves Jude Kinkade
and Derek Roman.

02:39.793 --> 02:42.896
I'm told Jude used
to get Derek coke.

02:44.655 --> 02:47.310
Jude? No.

02:47.379 --> 02:49.724
- Yes.
It's definitely true.

02:49.793 --> 02:52.000
I got it from the best.

02:52.068 --> 02:55.586
Now I just need someone close
to them to get the final nail.

02:56.551 --> 02:59.448
Jude's with Noah,
isn't he?

02:59.517 --> 03:02.793
- I'm not interested
in using my friend.

03:04.103 --> 03:05.689
- My boyfriend dealt coke.

03:05.758 --> 03:07.482
I wouldn't think
you'd be much of a friend

03:07.551 --> 03:09.241
if you didn't tell me.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.827
But all right,

03:13.896 --> 03:16.862
if not Noah,
maybe someone close to Derek.

03:18.379 --> 03:21.689
German, maybe.

03:21.758 --> 03:23.448
Or London.

03:24.758 --> 03:27.896
No one's closer
to Derek right now than London.

03:28.931 --> 03:31.275
- I'll figure it out.

03:36.965 --> 03:38.275
- Devils!

03:43.172 --> 03:45.344
- You got this.
- I do now.

03:47.620 --> 03:49.068
- A PDA.

03:49.137 --> 03:51.206
Finally pulling your love train
out of the station, huh?

03:51.275 --> 03:53.206
- And onto the red carpet.

03:53.275 --> 03:54.586
A big movie premiere
tomorrow night.

03:54.655 --> 03:56.862
- Get it!

04:00.689 --> 04:02.517
- It's the final seconds
of the Western Conference.

04:02.586 --> 04:04.758
It's anybody's game.

04:08.137 --> 04:10.448
The Devils are going
to the final!

04:16.413 --> 04:18.862
- Hello, baby's first finals.

04:18.931 --> 04:20.620
- Yeah, it's great.

04:20.689 --> 04:22.310
- Hey, what's going on
with you?

04:22.379 --> 04:25.896
- Are you asking as my friend
or my manager?

04:25.965 --> 04:27.827
- Whichever one
gets me the answer.

04:27.896 --> 04:30.310
- I-I'll get it together
for finals.

04:30.379 --> 04:32.827
- Okay.

04:38.310 --> 04:39.448
- Derek's playing lights out.

04:39.517 --> 04:40.827
I've never seen him
play harder.

04:40.896 --> 04:42.344
- Wonder why.

04:42.413 --> 04:44.000
- What do you know?

04:44.068 --> 04:46.517
- I don't know anything.

04:46.586 --> 04:49.137
I'd be curious the last time
he was drug tested, though.

04:49.206 --> 04:51.448
- You think he dopes?

04:51.517 --> 04:52.931
- I think he parties.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.310
At least he used to.
- Everyone knows that.

04:57.551 --> 05:00.724
- Does everyone know
Jude brought the party?

05:03.655 --> 05:06.413
Jude used to score coke
for Derek.

05:06.482 --> 05:08.724
- Who told you that?

05:08.793 --> 05:10.448
- When Jude was just
an assistant,

05:10.517 --> 05:12.724
he hitched his wagon
to Derek's star.

05:12.793 --> 05:15.206
He became his go-to
for everything.

05:15.275 --> 05:17.344
- Including coke?

05:17.413 --> 05:19.206
- Being Derek's go-to
helped get

05:19.275 --> 05:20.586
Jude promoted to junior agent.

05:20.655 --> 05:23.103
It helped him get his start.

05:23.172 --> 05:25.482
Maybe you don't know your guy
as well as you think.

05:25.551 --> 05:27.517
- Or maybe Derek's not
your guy anymore

05:27.586 --> 05:28.862
and that's why
you're telling me this.

05:28.931 --> 05:31.931
- I'm telling you this
because you're my guy.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.413
- And the fact
that I'm a reporter.

05:33.482 --> 05:35.310
- Puts you in a position
to check it out

05:35.379 --> 05:38.000
and judge for yourself.

05:38.068 --> 05:40.034
But that's on you.

05:52.103 --> 05:54.517
- Hey.
I got your text.

05:54.586 --> 05:57.862
Something wrong?
- Yeah, now I know what it is.

06:04.655 --> 06:07.137
This is the week
your brother Marcus died.

06:08.103 --> 06:11.655
- Not one person's
brought him up to me.

06:13.068 --> 06:14.689
He should be in the finals.

06:14.758 --> 06:15.793
- But not you?

06:15.862 --> 06:18.758
- I'm playing for my brother.

06:18.827 --> 06:22.517
If I don't deliver--
- You already have.

06:22.586 --> 06:24.551
You and Derek brought
the team this far.

06:24.620 --> 06:28.517
These are your finals,
not Marcus'.

06:31.103 --> 06:32.758
- I gotta go.

06:41.137 --> 06:44.137
- The Devils have a 50-50 shot
at winning the title.

06:44.206 --> 06:46.965
That means that you have
a 50-50 shot of walking away

06:47.034 --> 06:49.551
with egg on your face
if you insist on keeping

06:49.620 --> 06:51.655
this campaign
against them going.

06:51.724 --> 06:53.862
- So you think I should
call a truce?

06:53.931 --> 06:55.655
- I think you should look
at the bigger picture.

06:55.724 --> 06:57.172
Warren, the Devils
making the finals

06:57.241 --> 07:00.965
is a feel-good story.
It's been great for the League.

07:01.034 --> 07:04.586
- I just need to get through
this season in peace.

07:04.655 --> 07:06.896
- If the Devils win,
the first person Jude

07:06.965 --> 07:10.931
wants Derek to thank in front
of millions of people is you.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.344
For all your support.

07:12.413 --> 07:14.620
Sounds pretty peaceful to me.

07:17.344 --> 07:19.620
I'll see myself out.

07:22.206 --> 07:23.724
Eve.

07:24.620 --> 07:25.931
- What was she doing here?

07:26.000 --> 07:27.689
- Making a good argument
for dropping

07:27.758 --> 07:29.241
my ultimatum
against the Devils.

07:29.310 --> 07:31.655
- You can't be
considering that.

07:32.931 --> 07:35.068
- I'm more than considering it.

07:35.137 --> 07:38.724
- I don't care what she said--
- Enough.

07:38.793 --> 07:41.275
I'm taking you off time-out.

07:41.344 --> 07:43.517
And off payroll.

07:43.586 --> 07:45.482
Eve, you're fired.

07:51.896 --> 07:53.793
- Hey, you coming
to the premiere?

07:53.862 --> 07:56.724
- Mm, can't afford
a free movie.

07:56.793 --> 07:59.517
But I'm glad you came by.

07:59.586 --> 08:02.793
I need a maid of honor.
You game?

08:03.896 --> 08:07.137
- Wow.
Kyle, I'm honored.

08:07.206 --> 08:10.413
But I've never planned
that kind of party.

08:10.482 --> 08:13.206
Maybe you want someone with
a little bit more experience.

08:13.275 --> 08:15.310
- We only have enough money
for 12 beach chairs

08:15.379 --> 08:16.655
and some bug spray.

08:16.724 --> 08:19.413
Think you can handle that.
- Can you?

08:19.482 --> 08:22.793
Marry a guy with no money?

08:22.862 --> 08:24.827
I thought you'd wait
for the big score.

08:26.413 --> 08:28.689
I scored Beau.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.206
But if you want to launch
a Kickstarter

08:30.275 --> 08:32.413
for our honeymoon,
please, start kicking.

08:46.655 --> 08:49.034
- Miami just won
home-court advantage.

08:49.103 --> 08:50.482
- That's rough,

08:50.551 --> 08:51.965
opening finals on the road.

08:52.034 --> 08:54.379
- I'm good with it.
They blew up our house.

08:54.448 --> 08:55.862
Now we tear down theirs.

08:55.931 --> 08:57.862
- Maybe this time, their coach
gets the concussion.

08:59.137 --> 09:00.448
- It wasn't too long ago
you were trying

09:00.517 --> 09:02.241
to give each other concussions.

09:02.310 --> 09:05.827
Now you're running up hills
fetching pails of water.

09:05.896 --> 09:08.206
Hard to imagine what could have
torn you boys apart.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.862
- Things happen.

09:13.931 --> 09:15.310
- Right.

09:15.379 --> 09:19.000
- I got a date to get to.
You two kids have fun.

09:21.793 --> 09:24.758
- Are we having fun?
My night's wide open.

09:25.517 --> 09:27.482
- I can't.

09:27.551 --> 09:29.586
Sorry.

09:29.655 --> 09:31.482
- Everything okay?

09:31.551 --> 09:33.206
- Totally.

09:33.275 --> 09:35.241
I'm just...

09:35.310 --> 09:36.689
trying to get ahead.

09:54.689 --> 09:57.689
- I heard you were fired.
- And you came to gloat.

10:01.310 --> 10:04.103
I came to congratulate you.

10:04.172 --> 10:06.241
You're free.

10:07.241 --> 10:08.689
- I feel free.

10:08.758 --> 10:11.310
I almost lost a heel
running through the field.

10:11.379 --> 10:14.206
- Hey, you're lucky I didn't
come here to kick your ass.

10:14.275 --> 10:16.000
You came after my friend.

10:16.068 --> 10:18.172
Jude's entire life
is the Devils.

10:18.241 --> 10:21.862
- Your loyalty never ceases
to amaze me.

10:22.793 --> 10:24.689
- That's what loyalty does.

10:24.758 --> 10:27.620
- Sometimes it horrifies.

10:27.689 --> 10:30.275
Everyone in that arena
knew the truth

10:30.344 --> 10:33.344
about German and my mother.

10:33.413 --> 10:35.241
Did you?

10:35.310 --> 10:36.689
- I just found out.

10:38.689 --> 10:42.000
I can only imagine
how you must feel.

10:42.068 --> 10:43.620
- You're right.

10:43.689 --> 10:45.896
You can only imagine.

10:45.965 --> 10:48.931
- I do know how desperate
and alone I felt

10:49.000 --> 10:52.137
when I went to Oscar
for help once.

10:52.206 --> 10:54.000
It almost destroyed me.

10:56.827 --> 10:58.793
- There's nothing left
to destroy.

10:58.862 --> 11:01.241
- That's not true.

11:03.103 --> 11:06.379
I can help you find a new job,
new goals.

11:06.448 --> 11:09.413
You don't have to be alone.

11:09.482 --> 11:11.758
I could be loyal to you.

11:12.862 --> 11:14.344
If you let me.

11:24.620 --> 11:25.862
Eve.

11:27.862 --> 11:30.379
Whatever this is...

11:30.448 --> 11:32.241
I can't know.

11:32.310 --> 11:34.896
Not until you let go
of this vendetta.

11:37.275 --> 11:38.413
Will you?

12:01.896 --> 12:04.241
- Derek, London, over here!
- Derek!

12:04.310 --> 12:06.758
- So, D-Ro, London,
what is this now?

12:06.827 --> 12:09.620
- Derek, a little to the left.

12:09.689 --> 12:10.793
- Right this way, please!

12:10.862 --> 12:12.862
- I'm glad
we made it official.

12:12.931 --> 12:14.689
- Should have done it sooner.

12:15.965 --> 12:17.896
- Guys, right this way!

12:17.965 --> 12:20.689
- Not me.
- Oh, yeah, black girl magic!

12:20.758 --> 12:22.724
- Pastor Curtis!
- Any statements?

12:22.793 --> 12:24.172
Pastor Curtis.
- Can we get a minute

12:24.241 --> 12:26.241
of your time?
- Jamie, over here, over here!

12:26.310 --> 12:27.344
Questions, questions.

12:27.413 --> 12:28.586
- Over this way. This way!
- Jamie.

12:28.655 --> 12:29.655
Pastor Curtis, please.

12:29.724 --> 12:31.379
- Pastor Curtis, over here.

12:40.724 --> 12:43.034
- What the hell are you doing?
- Are you jealous?

12:44.655 --> 12:46.689
- How did you even meet him?

12:46.758 --> 12:49.034
- Christian Mingle.

12:49.103 --> 12:52.862
You're having your date.
I'm having mine.

12:52.931 --> 12:54.758
- I thought you were better
than this.

12:54.827 --> 12:56.862
- Well, I guess
you thought wrong.

13:00.586 --> 13:03.827
- Just when I thought
you couldn't sink any lower,

13:03.896 --> 13:05.965
you find a new pile of shit
to limbo under.

13:06.034 --> 13:07.931
- Oh, I'm not sinking, London.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.517
I'm finally lifting myself
back up.

13:09.586 --> 13:10.689
I'd think you'd
be happy for me.

13:10.758 --> 13:12.103
- You don't think,

13:12.172 --> 13:14.000
or else you wouldn't
be here with her.

13:14.068 --> 13:17.344
- Oh, it was an invitation
I couldn't refuse.

13:17.413 --> 13:19.103
- Much like my gag reflex
right now.

13:19.172 --> 13:20.965
- Or maybe she saw something
in me.

13:21.034 --> 13:23.172
Same thing you see.
- I have Derek now.

13:23.241 --> 13:25.758
- Yeah, but does Derek
have you?

13:25.827 --> 13:27.586
Does he know you like I do?

13:27.655 --> 13:29.206
Has he seen you cry?

13:30.206 --> 13:32.413
Does he know all your secrets?

13:32.482 --> 13:35.379
- A real man
protects his woman.

13:35.448 --> 13:38.793
You threw yours to the wolves
and hid like a bitch.

13:38.862 --> 13:41.551
You're lucky
there are cameras here.

13:41.620 --> 13:45.482
- I hope this wasn't
too awkward for you.

13:45.551 --> 13:47.310
Enjoy the show.

13:54.517 --> 13:56.103
- Are you okay?

13:56.172 --> 13:57.551
- Don't worry about me.

13:57.620 --> 13:59.655
Worry about her.

14:06.413 --> 14:07.931
- Eve.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.482
You always pick
the most out-of-the-way places.

14:11.551 --> 14:14.310
It's like you're ashamed of me.

14:14.379 --> 14:16.275
- Pierce.

14:16.344 --> 14:18.965
I need dirt on someone.

14:19.034 --> 14:20.137
- Who?

14:20.206 --> 14:23.103
- Commissioner Matthews.

14:23.172 --> 14:25.862
- I am losing track
of your hit list.

14:25.931 --> 14:28.275
- Fortunately,
that's not your job.

14:28.344 --> 14:31.000
- It is, actually.

14:31.068 --> 14:34.482
I'll tell you what.
I'll do this for you.

14:34.551 --> 14:37.275
But you have
to do something for me.

14:39.551 --> 14:41.241
Tit for tat.

14:45.344 --> 14:46.931
- What do you want?

14:47.000 --> 14:50.206
- I want to know
what exactly...

14:50.275 --> 14:52.482
you've got going on,

14:52.551 --> 14:55.172
what your endgame is.

14:55.241 --> 14:57.551
- I'm not that cheap.

14:57.620 --> 14:59.206
- Neither am I.

15:04.068 --> 15:06.620
- Team jet leaves in an hour,
fellas.

15:06.689 --> 15:09.206
You want to play game one,
be on it.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.862
Let's go, let's go.
Hustle up.

15:16.517 --> 15:19.068
- German.
Hey.

15:19.137 --> 15:20.206
- Noah.

15:22.172 --> 15:24.586
- Are we alone?

15:24.655 --> 15:27.344
- Yeah.
What's up?

15:27.413 --> 15:30.137
- I was doing some research
on a Derek-Jude thing,

15:30.206 --> 15:33.482
and I stumbled on
a Derek-German thing.

15:33.551 --> 15:35.068
- Derek-German?

15:35.137 --> 15:37.931
- Did you guys control the
spread in a game this season?

15:39.103 --> 15:41.517
- Come on, Noah.

15:41.586 --> 15:43.517
- So it didn't happen?

15:43.586 --> 15:45.896
- Stumbled on how?

15:45.965 --> 15:47.931
- You're not answering
the question.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.793
- There's nothing to answer.

15:49.862 --> 15:52.103
Somebody would be a fool
to admit to that.

15:52.172 --> 15:54.068
- Somebody would be a fool
to lie,

15:54.137 --> 15:56.482
especially if I could
connect them

15:56.551 --> 15:58.344
to someone shady
from Derek's past

15:58.413 --> 16:02.172
who made a big bet on a game
LA played against Portland.

16:02.241 --> 16:05.068
I pulled the tape.
Derek held the ball.

16:07.620 --> 16:10.379
- It didn't have anything
to do with Derek.

16:10.448 --> 16:11.965
It was me.

16:12.034 --> 16:14.896
I had this thing
that needed to happen.

16:14.965 --> 16:17.206
Just ten points in a game.

16:17.275 --> 16:19.379
Derek was only helping me
out of a jam.

16:19.448 --> 16:21.551
Trust me.

16:21.620 --> 16:23.310
It affected nothing.

16:23.379 --> 16:26.551
Just one game
at the beginning of the season.

16:26.620 --> 16:28.448
I swear,
it's nothing.

16:30.827 --> 16:32.275
- Okay.

16:32.344 --> 16:34.000
I figured there had
to be an explanation.

16:34.068 --> 16:36.068
That's why I came to you first.

16:36.137 --> 16:38.482
- Thank you for that.
I appreciate it.

16:38.551 --> 16:40.931
- Sure.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.655
Slaughter them in Miami.

16:42.724 --> 16:44.172
- We'll do our best.

16:53.862 --> 16:55.241
It was me.

16:55.310 --> 16:58.206
I had this thing
that needed to happen.

16:58.275 --> 17:00.413
Just ten points in a game.

17:00.482 --> 17:03.206
Derek was only helping me
out of a jam.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.896
- Hurry up, Kyle's gonna
be here any minute.

17:09.965 --> 17:12.896
- Ooh, love is in the air.

17:24.034 --> 17:26.241
- Oh, you little Devils!

17:26.310 --> 17:27.896
- Surprise.

17:27.965 --> 17:30.689
- Desiree! You're here!

17:30.758 --> 17:31.862
Oh!

17:31.931 --> 17:32.965
- Kyle Hart's
bachelorette party,

17:33.034 --> 17:34.172
where else would I be?

17:35.517 --> 17:36.758
You are full of surprises.

17:36.827 --> 17:39.482
- And I've got one more.
- Mm.

17:39.551 --> 17:41.241
- No one knows we're here.

17:41.310 --> 17:43.310
I only had a budget
for a lockpick.

17:44.379 --> 17:46.724
- You broke
into the Playground?

17:46.793 --> 17:48.862
Oh, I have raised my girls
so well.

17:50.620 --> 17:52.275
Okay. It's time.

17:54.344 --> 17:56.793
- Oh.

17:56.862 --> 17:58.724
Uh-uh.

18:00.241 --> 18:01.724
Okay, I don't know
what kind of lady boner

18:01.793 --> 18:03.862
y'all are trying to give me,
but have at it.

18:03.931 --> 18:04.931
Come on.

18:08.586 --> 18:12.413
So far, this is the laziest
dance y'all have ever done.

18:27.827 --> 18:28.793
- Oh, yeah!

19:19.862 --> 19:20.793
- Oh, my God!

20:19.689 --> 20:23.758
- Yes!

20:30.000 --> 20:31.862
- Yes!

20:36.896 --> 20:39.000
- I love me some party favors.

20:39.068 --> 20:42.068
- You could go home
with a goody bag.

20:43.103 --> 20:44.862
- Keep your goodies
in your bag, Valentino.

20:44.931 --> 20:47.344
I'm a proper wife-to-be.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.206
- Oh!

20:49.275 --> 20:51.655
- Okay, what's going on?

20:51.724 --> 20:52.965
- What?

20:53.034 --> 20:55.000
- We all saw Jamie
with the pastor.

20:55.068 --> 20:56.275
You're here.
She's right there.

20:56.344 --> 20:58.172
Her ass is thoroughly
unkicked.

20:58.241 --> 21:00.827
- Tonight is your night, Kyle.

21:00.896 --> 21:02.724
- And tomorrow?

21:02.793 --> 21:05.241
- Tomorrow you'll be gone.

21:05.310 --> 21:07.620
I want her ass kicked...

21:07.689 --> 21:09.241
out of the Devil Girls.

21:25.206 --> 21:26.931
- You look amazing.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.344
- Thanks.

21:28.413 --> 21:30.862
- You looked amazing
on that red carpet too.

21:30.931 --> 21:34.241
- Hey--
- Don't bother.

21:38.482 --> 21:40.344
- London.
Hey.

21:40.413 --> 21:42.068
- Hey, you ready?

21:42.137 --> 21:44.034
- Uh, I am.
Yeah.

21:44.103 --> 21:45.379
Kyle, not so sure.

21:45.448 --> 21:48.103
She's been in that cabana
for an hour.

21:48.172 --> 21:49.586
Been looking for holes
around the beach

21:49.655 --> 21:50.896
to see if she Shawshanked.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.068
- Could you get her?

21:55.137 --> 21:57.172
- On it.
- Yeah, please.

21:59.724 --> 22:01.862
- Derek.

22:01.931 --> 22:04.896
- Save it.
- I wanna explain.

22:04.965 --> 22:06.206
- You wanna save your ass,

22:06.275 --> 22:07.551
and you'll say anything
to do it.

22:07.620 --> 22:09.379
- That's right, I will.

22:09.448 --> 22:12.241
Because being a Devil Girl
is all I've got,

22:12.310 --> 22:15.448
and you're the only one
who can help me stay one.

22:15.517 --> 22:17.137
- Why should I?

22:17.206 --> 22:19.655
- Because you humped
and dumped me, for starters.

22:19.724 --> 22:21.655
How about that?

22:21.724 --> 22:24.965
How did you think
that would make me feel, hmm?

22:25.034 --> 22:26.689
You didn't.

22:26.758 --> 22:28.724
'Cause you had something better
to run off to.

22:28.793 --> 22:30.379
- Not better.

22:30.448 --> 22:32.689
- You know, after
the at least friendship

22:32.758 --> 22:34.241
I thought we had...

22:35.862 --> 22:38.655
You told me once
I was a fighter.

22:38.724 --> 22:40.000
And you were right.

22:40.068 --> 22:42.827
When you grow up dirty,
you fight dirty.

22:42.896 --> 22:44.620
Everything was being
taken from me.

22:44.689 --> 22:46.344
I just...

22:46.413 --> 22:48.344
wanted to take something back,

22:48.413 --> 22:51.241
even if it was just my pride.

22:51.310 --> 22:53.482
- Did you get it?

22:53.551 --> 22:54.896
- No.

22:58.344 --> 23:00.137
I'll see what I can do.

23:00.206 --> 23:02.068
But this is it.

23:02.137 --> 23:04.344
Your last save.

23:08.586 --> 23:10.586
- Kyle?

23:10.655 --> 23:13.482
- Leave a message
after the beep.

23:13.551 --> 23:17.310
Beep.
- Should I send Beau in?

23:17.379 --> 23:19.379
- I'm just gonna need a minute.

23:21.068 --> 23:22.793
- You've had 60.

23:22.862 --> 23:25.931
- I'm having...

23:26.000 --> 23:27.206
thoughts.

23:27.275 --> 23:28.965
- Like second thoughts?

23:29.034 --> 23:30.758
- No, pretty much
just the one.

23:34.551 --> 23:37.068
I'm never gonna have sex
with another man again.

23:40.551 --> 23:42.827
Whew, I'm sweating

23:42.896 --> 23:44.275
and cold
and dizzy all at once.

23:44.344 --> 23:46.655
I--
Do you hear that ringing?

23:47.931 --> 23:49.068
Okay.

23:49.137 --> 23:50.793
- So let me ask you this.
- Mm.

23:50.862 --> 23:53.206
- If you could only
have sex with one man

23:53.275 --> 23:55.275
for the rest of your life,
who would it be?

24:05.310 --> 24:06.793
- I talked to Eve.

24:06.862 --> 24:09.275
- I hope you had better luck
getting through to her.

24:12.620 --> 24:14.689
Did something happen
between you two?

24:16.724 --> 24:18.517
- We kissed.

24:20.862 --> 24:22.275
Lionel...

24:22.344 --> 24:25.000
she's messed with all of us.
You can't trust her.

24:25.068 --> 24:26.241
- Are you telling me
to back away

24:26.310 --> 24:27.793
because you don't want me
to have her

24:27.862 --> 24:30.172
or because you don't want her
to have me?

24:32.517 --> 24:34.275
- I know you can't
keep a secret,

24:34.344 --> 24:35.586
but I can't keep one from you,

24:35.655 --> 24:38.724
not after what you told me
about your ex.

24:38.793 --> 24:41.655
So I have to risk it.

24:41.724 --> 24:45.793
When you asked
about me and Derek,

24:45.862 --> 24:47.000
I danced around it.

24:47.068 --> 24:49.103
There's more to it.

24:49.172 --> 24:51.724
When I was starting out...

24:51.793 --> 24:54.379
I would do anything to have
a seat at that table.

24:54.448 --> 24:57.689
And part of that involved...

24:57.758 --> 25:00.310
me getting Derek something.

25:04.689 --> 25:06.551
Getting Derek coke.

25:07.724 --> 25:09.000
Look, I was young,

25:09.068 --> 25:11.344
but I knew what I was doing.

25:11.413 --> 25:13.310
We had a falling-out about it,

25:13.379 --> 25:16.379
and it was just...

25:16.448 --> 25:18.620
- Thank you for telling me.

25:22.827 --> 25:24.931
- Well, that's not all.

25:26.137 --> 25:28.517
The big secret
going around here

25:28.586 --> 25:30.206
involves the commissioner.

25:30.275 --> 25:31.517
He gave us an ultimatum.

25:31.586 --> 25:34.275
We either win the title,
or we're done.

25:34.344 --> 25:37.241
The League will yank
our franchise and...

25:37.310 --> 25:40.344
bring a new team to LA.

25:40.413 --> 25:43.103
Eve Vincent stirred him up.

25:43.172 --> 25:45.241
She has it out for everyone.

25:45.310 --> 25:47.655
She did from the minute
she got here.

25:49.206 --> 25:51.000
- It all makes sense,

25:51.068 --> 25:53.103
why you've been working
so hard.

25:53.172 --> 25:56.206
- Well, you've been
working hard too.

25:56.275 --> 25:57.793
- Yeah...

25:59.655 --> 26:03.000
I've been working on a story.

26:03.068 --> 26:04.517
But...

26:06.551 --> 26:09.448
It's not a stone
I want to turn anymore.

26:09.517 --> 26:11.758
So I'm dropping it.

26:11.827 --> 26:14.551
- Since when do you stop
pursuing a story?

26:16.103 --> 26:19.344
- When it could hurt someone
who doesn't deserve it.

26:26.275 --> 26:29.344
- Noah.
- Jude.

26:30.793 --> 26:32.482
- I knew it.
It's what I told you.

26:32.551 --> 26:35.034
- It's not what you said.

26:35.103 --> 26:36.482
It's...

26:38.034 --> 26:39.827
That doesn't even scratch
the surface

26:39.896 --> 26:41.655
of what you hold on to.

26:43.068 --> 26:45.862
You're so secretive.

26:47.827 --> 26:49.517
It's second nature.

26:49.586 --> 26:51.448
It's just who you are.

26:51.517 --> 26:53.241
- I'll be better.

26:53.310 --> 26:54.931
- You're perfect.

26:56.965 --> 26:58.862
You're just not perfect
for me.

27:01.413 --> 27:04.068
I don't blame you.

27:04.137 --> 27:05.655
I just...

27:07.551 --> 27:09.000
I just can't love you.

27:11.482 --> 27:13.379
I'm sorry.

27:32.517 --> 27:35.000
- Okay.
Kyle's coming.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.103
What?

27:39.172 --> 27:40.724
- I need to talk to you.

27:40.793 --> 27:42.275
About Jamie.

27:42.344 --> 27:44.310
- Oh, did she drown?
Did I miss it?

27:44.379 --> 27:46.275
- I need her to stay
on the team.

27:47.517 --> 27:49.724
I'm not excusing what she did.

27:50.724 --> 27:52.344
But she's had a tough life.
She knows she screwed up.

27:52.413 --> 27:54.413
And some of that
may be my fault.

27:55.793 --> 27:58.448
But that's it.
After this, she's on her own.

27:59.517 --> 28:00.965
I hope you can understand.

28:03.586 --> 28:06.448
- You're a good man,
Derek Roman.

28:13.620 --> 28:15.310
- Tide's coming in, bitches.

28:15.379 --> 28:16.931
Let's get this show
on the road.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.551
- You look incredible.
- I know.

28:28.620 --> 28:30.758
Where's the officiant?

28:30.827 --> 28:32.103
- Here.

28:32.172 --> 28:34.862
- Excuse me?
- It took five minutes online.

28:34.931 --> 28:36.344
- Come on, now.
- Here I come.

28:36.413 --> 28:37.965
You know it.
All right, all right.

28:40.793 --> 28:42.896
- He's a cool-ass dude, right?

28:42.965 --> 28:44.793
- Hell yeah.

28:44.862 --> 28:46.862
- She's a bomb-ass chick,
right?

28:46.931 --> 28:48.482
- The bombest.

28:48.551 --> 28:49.896
- Then by the power
vested in me,

28:49.965 --> 28:51.931
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.862
I don't want to see
any lipstick left.

29:09.034 --> 29:11.517
- Guys.

29:11.586 --> 29:13.586
You got a permit
for all this?

29:14.896 --> 29:16.448
- Time to hot step, y'all.

29:16.517 --> 29:18.344
Hey, don't forget
the presents!

29:18.413 --> 29:20.551
Okay, thanks.
- Thanks, buddy.

29:30.931 --> 29:33.172
- What you did was messed up.

29:37.310 --> 29:38.551
- I've been a friend to you.

29:38.620 --> 29:40.413
- Oh, that's crap,
and we both know it.

29:41.620 --> 29:44.482
We're something,
but it's not friends.

29:44.551 --> 29:47.172
But you keep me around
to what?

29:47.241 --> 29:48.586
Help your ego?

29:48.655 --> 29:51.344
Have something to wag
in front of Derek?

29:53.137 --> 29:55.241
And to go to the premiere
with the pastor?

29:55.310 --> 29:58.172
- Sometimes you have to make
strong moves to be great.

29:58.241 --> 29:59.551
- You think that was strong?

29:59.620 --> 30:02.068
That was sloppy.

30:02.137 --> 30:03.724
You made this whole scene,

30:03.793 --> 30:06.206
and the only thing people saw
was a mess.

30:06.275 --> 30:09.379
No one saw you,
but I see you.

30:09.448 --> 30:10.862
You're so scared.

30:10.931 --> 30:14.034
People will take from you,
hurt you, leave you--

30:14.103 --> 30:15.586
- Because they do.

30:15.655 --> 30:17.862
- You hold on so tight,

30:17.931 --> 30:20.517
but you have a guy
standing in front of you

30:20.586 --> 30:22.896
that you don't have to worry
about holding on to

30:22.965 --> 30:25.206
because he'll never
let go of you,

30:25.275 --> 30:28.896
and I've had every reason to.

30:28.965 --> 30:30.517
But I'm here.

30:34.448 --> 30:36.827
I'm here.

31:47.275 --> 31:48.793
Excuse me, mister.

31:48.862 --> 31:50.620
I just gave you
a triple orgasm.

31:50.689 --> 31:53.862
I'ma need a bigger
smile than that.

31:53.931 --> 31:56.379
- I'm happy.

31:57.206 --> 31:59.517
I am. I just feel...

32:01.241 --> 32:03.758
- Feel what?

32:03.827 --> 32:05.655
- Guilty.

32:05.724 --> 32:08.344
You married someone broke.

32:08.413 --> 32:09.827
I know it was a sacrifice,

32:09.896 --> 32:12.344
and don't deny that I needed
the jaws of life

32:12.413 --> 32:14.724
to get you
out of that cabana.

32:16.034 --> 32:18.793
- Beau.
Hey.

32:18.862 --> 32:22.379
Nothing could keep me
from marrying you.

32:22.448 --> 32:24.379
That's what really
freaked me out.

32:24.448 --> 32:26.482
I knew.

32:26.551 --> 32:28.482
You had me.

32:28.551 --> 32:30.827
Body and soul.

32:30.896 --> 32:32.724
And body.

32:34.965 --> 32:38.965
I'd rather be poor with you
than rich with anyone else.

32:39.034 --> 32:40.896
- I love you, Kyle.

32:40.965 --> 32:43.103
- I love you too.

32:43.172 --> 32:44.655
You son of a bitch.

33:03.103 --> 33:04.965
- Your stuff's right there.

33:07.931 --> 33:10.344
Um...

33:10.413 --> 33:12.172
so...

33:12.241 --> 33:14.000
somewhere between...

33:14.068 --> 33:16.517
last night
and this morning--

33:16.586 --> 33:18.620
- Can we not?

33:18.689 --> 33:20.793
- You're freaking out.

33:20.862 --> 33:23.310
All right, I get it.
It's okay.

33:23.379 --> 33:25.448
- Pax...

33:25.517 --> 33:27.586
you're a good guy.

33:27.655 --> 33:30.137
I don't want to hurt you.

33:30.206 --> 33:32.379
- Do I look hurt?

33:32.448 --> 33:34.206
I told you

33:34.275 --> 33:36.482
I wouldn't let go.

33:36.551 --> 33:38.655
And I meant it.

33:40.034 --> 33:42.827
You deserve to go
the distance with someone.

33:42.896 --> 33:45.896
- I did go the distance
with someone.

33:48.068 --> 33:49.448
Derek.

33:54.965 --> 33:57.482
Right.

34:06.724 --> 34:08.586
- You spoke to Noah?

34:08.655 --> 34:11.655
- Yeah, the coke story
was a dead end.

34:11.724 --> 34:13.448
There was something else,
but that's dead too.

34:13.517 --> 34:15.206
- What something else?

34:15.275 --> 34:17.275
- Noah thought Derek
may have helped German

34:17.344 --> 34:18.724
fix a spread
against Portland.

34:18.793 --> 34:20.586
But it all wound up being

34:20.655 --> 34:22.379
a great big pile of nothing.

34:22.448 --> 34:24.586
We're out of moves.

34:25.724 --> 34:28.896
- We're not out of moves.

34:36.896 --> 34:38.310
- If you're looking
for a tearful good-bye,

34:38.379 --> 34:39.586
you've wasted your time.

34:40.896 --> 34:42.344
I don't need your tears
or good-bye.

34:42.413 --> 34:43.689
I'm staying.

34:46.379 --> 34:47.724
- You're what?

34:47.793 --> 34:49.689
- I wanted you to be
the first to know.

34:49.758 --> 34:52.724
I'm restarting my church in LA.

34:52.793 --> 34:55.965
Hollywood loves
a good redemption story.

34:56.034 --> 34:57.448
You got yours.

34:57.517 --> 35:00.172
Now I'ma get mine.

35:00.241 --> 35:02.000
Be seeing you around, London.

35:02.068 --> 35:03.758
A lot.

35:09.655 --> 35:12.068
- One game down.
- Three to go.

35:13.206 --> 35:14.655
- You okay?

35:14.724 --> 35:15.724
- Yeah.

35:15.793 --> 35:17.310
And thanks to you,

35:17.379 --> 35:19.241
Commissioner Matthews
is looking to ease up on us.

35:19.310 --> 35:20.586
- One more to go around?

35:20.655 --> 35:22.689
- How'd you get past security?

35:22.758 --> 35:24.793
- I came in on
the commissioner's badge.

35:24.862 --> 35:26.758
- He fired you.

35:26.827 --> 35:29.000
- Fired and rehired

35:29.068 --> 35:32.137
when he realized he made
a terrible mistake.

35:32.206 --> 35:34.586
It helped to learn
his wife's infidelity

35:34.655 --> 35:36.689
wasn't limited to Pax.

35:36.758 --> 35:40.827
Turns out she slept
with seven different players

35:40.896 --> 35:43.068
from seven different teams.

35:43.137 --> 35:46.482
Faced with either
a career-ending scandal

35:46.551 --> 35:48.482
or a week in Hawaii,

35:48.551 --> 35:50.344
Warren chose the latter.

35:50.413 --> 35:53.137
He'll be spending some time
there with the missus,

35:53.206 --> 35:57.068
trying to repair
that freak show of a marriage.

35:57.137 --> 36:01.000
While he's gone,
I'll be representing him here.

36:02.413 --> 36:04.000
- You chose blackmail.

36:05.689 --> 36:08.517
- The Devils have
no safety net.

36:08.586 --> 36:11.551
No reprieve.

36:11.620 --> 36:14.724
It's title or game over.

36:22.586 --> 36:24.034
- Late workout?

36:26.000 --> 36:27.655
- Not in the mood for a chat.

36:27.724 --> 36:30.793
- Wasn't asking permission.

36:30.862 --> 36:33.862
You cried to Derek and got him
to come to your rescue.

36:33.931 --> 36:36.310
I told him
I was okay with that.

36:36.379 --> 36:37.896
We're both liars.

36:37.965 --> 36:40.241
So if you think got away
with that little stunt,

36:40.310 --> 36:41.724
you didn't.

36:41.793 --> 36:45.068
- I can't help it
if Derek is such a softy.

36:46.241 --> 36:49.413
Well, he wasn't
a few weeks ago

36:49.482 --> 36:52.172
when we had sex.
- Derek told me.

36:53.896 --> 36:57.034
That was the same day
it was over, right?

36:58.241 --> 37:01.448
Apparently,
you like all my hand-me-downs.

37:01.517 --> 37:03.000
Keep the pastor.

37:03.068 --> 37:05.103
He's going straight to hell,

37:05.172 --> 37:07.758
and so will you.

37:13.241 --> 37:16.965
- I've been waiting for you
to do that for so long.

37:21.379 --> 37:23.172
- Hello, Pax.

37:25.793 --> 37:27.965
- I got nothing to say to you.

37:28.034 --> 37:29.620
- Not even a "thank you"?

37:29.689 --> 37:32.724
- "Thank you"?
For what?

37:32.793 --> 37:34.862
Trying to get me cut
from the team?

37:34.931 --> 37:36.965
- Actually, yes.

37:37.034 --> 37:39.068
- I heard you were crazy.

37:39.137 --> 37:43.344
- I'm sure you heard I was
a whole bunch of things.

37:43.413 --> 37:45.758
I tried to get you out.

37:45.827 --> 37:47.344
But you hanging on

37:47.413 --> 37:50.517
might wind up being
the best thing for both of us.

37:50.586 --> 37:52.310
- What are you talking about?

37:52.379 --> 37:54.000
- You can help me.

37:54.931 --> 37:57.241
To do what's right.

37:57.310 --> 37:58.862
You have integrity

37:58.931 --> 38:01.965
where the others don't, Pax.

38:02.034 --> 38:04.379
Including your idol, Derek.

38:04.448 --> 38:07.000
- You don't know Derek.

38:07.068 --> 38:09.586
- I know he fixed
a game with your coach

38:09.655 --> 38:11.241
to meet a ten-point spread.

38:13.448 --> 38:17.448
- Good night.
- An early game. Portland?

38:20.517 --> 38:23.275
Let me guess.

38:23.344 --> 38:28.344
You're remembering a moment
when he held on to the ball.

38:29.758 --> 38:32.586
What was the score?

38:32.655 --> 38:35.103
- 106 to 96.

38:35.172 --> 38:38.896
- Derek cheated while you were
on the court.

38:39.827 --> 38:42.379
He played fast and loose
with the rules

38:42.448 --> 38:43.896
and with your career.

38:43.965 --> 38:46.310
This tarnishes you now.

38:46.379 --> 38:49.275
The Devils
don't deserve a title.

38:50.620 --> 38:55.068
Derek Roman shouldn't be
celebrated by everyone

38:55.137 --> 38:57.896
while good people,
like your brother,

38:57.965 --> 39:01.000
are forgotten.

39:02.896 --> 39:06.310
Marcus never would have played
the game dirty like that.

39:09.034 --> 39:10.344
I can make it

39:10.413 --> 39:14.206
so your brother's legacy
lives on forever.

39:16.517 --> 39:18.965
- How?

39:19.034 --> 39:23.241
- When a new team comes to LA,

39:23.310 --> 39:25.724
I'll make sure
it's his name on the arena.

39:25.793 --> 39:27.241
- You can do that?

39:28.896 --> 39:31.137
- You just have
to help me make sure

39:31.206 --> 39:33.413
the Devils
don't win the title.

39:35.068 --> 39:38.000
The Devils are going down.

39:39.103 --> 39:41.517
Question is...

39:41.586 --> 39:45.344
whose side will you
be on when they do?

39:45.413 --> 39:48.310
Derek...

39:48.379 --> 39:49.793
or Marcus?

39:57.758 --> 39:59.310
- Marcus.

40:06.137 --> 40:08.724
- Next time, on the season
finale of "Hit the Floor"...

40:08.793 --> 40:10.448
- It's title or game over.

40:10.517 --> 40:12.310
- It's either I win
my first title as a head coach

40:12.379 --> 40:14.068
or I coached the last season
of the Devils ever.

40:14.137 --> 40:15.655
- You're on your own.
- I hate secrets,

40:15.724 --> 40:17.344
and I was keeping
the biggest secret of all.

40:17.413 --> 40:19.000
- One more thing,
something I've been

40:19.068 --> 40:20.793
afraid to tell you,
but I have to.

40:20.862 --> 40:22.724
- Someone has to lose.
- What the hell is this?

40:22.793 --> 40:24.344
- I protected you!

40:24.413 --> 40:25.931
- Let's see what the headlines
are tomorrow.

40:32.034 --> 40:34.206
Devils Nation will fall.
