of Rastafari holidays --

00:31.232 --> 00:35.336

former emperor of Ethiopia,

00:35.369 --> 00:38.706
and, to some Rastafari,
the Messiah.

00:50.284 --> 00:53.254
The Rastafari movement was born
out of Jamaica's struggle

00:53.287 --> 00:55.756
to free itself
of the cultural suppression

00:55.789 --> 00:59.059
and slavery imposed
by European imperialism.

01:07.435 --> 01:09.470
A main pillar of its ideology

is the acceptance of all people,
regardless of creed or color.

point for our exploration

Well, Rastafari, we are
the Children of His Majesty.

of the legacy of slavery.

03:21.835 --> 03:22.903

We said,
"We are no slaves.

We were the first
Children of the Most High."

03:28.008 --> 03:33.013
Within our liberty, we look
at the Christian doctrine

03:33.046 --> 03:35.816
as they put it to us
through the Bible.

03:35.849 --> 03:39.019
And when we decide for the
Bible, we realized that a lot

03:39.052 --> 03:42.690
of the things are not correct
as they put it in the Bible.

03:42.723 --> 03:47.295
So we have adopted
different Bible texts,

03:47.328 --> 03:49.630
and we have gone even beyond
even the Bible texts.

03:49.663 --> 03:53.801
We have adapted what we call
an Ital lifestyle.

03:53.834 --> 03:58.706
So we try to eat
as close to natural as possible.

03:58.739 --> 04:01.642
And we try to live
a certain life.

04:01.675 --> 04:05.546
And this is why we say
the color of a man's skin

as the color of his eyes.

04:22.896 --> 04:25.733
Homosexuality,
we don't believe in,

that you're not pro-life.

Condemnation and protests
from activists abroad

against some of these messages.

And in 2012, Beenie Man,
known as the King of Dancehall,

11:15.976 --> 11:18.445
was forced to publicly address
certain songs

11:18.478 --> 11:20.213
from earlier in his career.

I have nothing against no one.

Nice to meet you.

11:50.177 --> 11:53.246
Obviously, so many people
are very familiar with reggae.

11:53.280 --> 11:56.249
I think they're less familiar
with dancehall.

12:11.298 --> 12:13.901
Did the themes of the music
change from, like,

12:13.934 --> 12:15.202
the -- the message

12:15.235 --> 12:18.138

-Yeah, but. Yeah...

12:32.152 --> 12:33.854
Right.

13:05.886 --> 13:08.255
Right. Right. Right.

13:11.959 --> 13:13.460
Well, because
you have to understand

13:13.493 --> 13:14.995
that dancehall has

13:15.028 --> 13:17.397
Well, it has
very extreme influence.

Yeah?

It's not judgment.

-Mm-hmm.

They're suffering violence,
depression, shame.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.391
That's all.

13:54.601 --> 13:58.105
I know, but we heard lots
of stories that, you know...

13:58.138 --> 13:59.973
I don't think --
That's -- That's fine.

14:00.007 --> 14:02.042
I don't think it's a lie,
but --

14:07.915 --> 14:09.883
It seems to be,
you know, really hard

14:09.917 --> 14:12.419

or lesbian here.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.221
Really hard.

you know, change for people?

-Right.
-You'd...

14:24.331 --> 14:27.067
You'd love her, right?
Yeah.

down the street, marry them.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.410

14:37.444 --> 14:40.113
And I understand that,
as a protective father,

14:40.147 --> 14:42.315
to not -- to not want
your daughter to be hurt.

14:42.349 --> 14:45.152
I'm saying, wouldn't you
just wish that for her,

14:45.185 --> 14:47.187

to the media backlash,

15:25.758 --> 15:28.395
perhaps
for purely commercial reasons,

15:28.428 --> 15:32.032
or because some may actually
have become more accepting,

15:32.065 --> 15:35.002
in the past few years,
most major dancehall artists

15:35.035 --> 15:37.170
have stopped writing
anti-gay lyrics.

15:37.204 --> 15:39.106
**

15:39.139 --> 15:42.342
The one thing possibly more
influential than the music here

15:42.375 --> 15:44.244
is religion.

15:44.277 --> 15:48.448
First brought to the island by
the Spanish over 500 years ago,

15:48.481 --> 15:51.618
the power of religion
reaches far here.

15:51.651 --> 15:53.253
It's even been claimed

15:53.286 --> 15:55.755
that Jamaica has more churches
per square mile

15:55.788 --> 15:58.658
than any other country
in the world.

15:58.691 --> 16:01.194
So we want to speak
with Bishop Alvin Bailey

16:01.228 --> 16:03.496
of the Portmore Holiness
Christian Church

16:03.530 --> 16:05.098
to help us understand

16:05.132 --> 16:08.735
the religion's perspective
on being queer.

16:08.768 --> 16:11.504
DANIEL: So, how does the Church
feel about homosexuality?

16:11.538 --> 16:14.141
All Christian denominations
in Jamaica

16:14.174 --> 16:17.077
not feel the Bible teaches
that homosexuality,

16:17.110 --> 16:19.479
the practice of homosexuality,
is sin.

16:19.512 --> 16:23.383
But the homosexual person
is God's divine creation,

16:23.416 --> 16:26.419
like every one of us, to be
redeemed by the power of God,

16:26.453 --> 16:28.055
and we believe
that God can do that.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.489
Is your belief
that people

16:29.522 --> 16:32.659
who are -- who -- who are gay
aren't born gay?

16:32.692 --> 16:35.062
We have no evidence
in Scripture to suggest

16:35.095 --> 16:37.197
that God created any person
a homosexual,

16:37.230 --> 16:38.531
in pretty much the same way

16:38.565 --> 16:40.400
that He has never created anyone
an adulterer.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.335
Have you -- Do you know some
other practice,

16:42.369 --> 16:43.736
for example,
of some of the gays?

16:43.770 --> 16:46.039
Do you know about things
like fisting and slurching

16:46.073 --> 16:48.041
and those kinds of behaviors
that are not human,

16:48.075 --> 16:50.110
that are not normal
for most persons?

16:50.143 --> 16:51.811
-I would actually say
there are straight people...
-Straight people.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.580
...that, also,
for sure fist,

16:53.613 --> 16:55.182
and I would say there's
a lot of gay people who don't.

16:55.215 --> 16:56.783
What was the other term
that you said?

16:56.816 --> 16:58.718
I'm sorry, you said something
after fisting.

16:58.751 --> 17:00.387
I've never heard that word
before.

17:00.420 --> 17:01.621
-Slurching.
-Slurching?

17:01.654 --> 17:03.356
-Yeah, what's slurching?
-What is that?

17:03.390 --> 17:06.259
Slurching is -- is -- is -- is
the discharging in the anus

17:06.293 --> 17:08.795
and then suck it from the anus
of the individual.

17:08.828 --> 17:11.298
-Mm.
-Like, oh, with your mouth?

17:11.331 --> 17:14.667
Yes. We are not used to that
kind of practices for two men.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.704
Even the whole business
of French kissing in public

17:17.737 --> 17:20.307
might be okay
for a heterosexual couple.

17:20.340 --> 17:22.775
In our society,
we are not totally used to

17:22.809 --> 17:25.078
that kind of thing,
maybe as yet.

17:25.112 --> 17:27.414
So, then do you think at some
point the LGBT community

17:27.447 --> 17:29.816
could potentially align
with your church?

17:29.849 --> 17:32.119
It is never likely
that any church

17:32.152 --> 17:34.721
is going to be aligned
to any homosexual group

17:34.754 --> 17:38.391
to the point
where we become synchronized.

may have gained independence

17:47.134 --> 17:51.271
from the British in 1962,
but remnants of colonialism

17:51.304 --> 17:55.142
still significantly impact
the queer community.

17:55.175 --> 17:59.779
Most notably, the so-called
"buggery law" is still in place.

17:59.812 --> 18:03.583
It's a set of articles
which deems sodomy illegal,

18:03.616 --> 18:04.851
carrying a punishment

18:04.884 --> 18:07.654
of 10 years' hard labor
or imprisonment.

18:07.687 --> 18:11.324
To this day, the law
has not been overturned,

18:11.358 --> 18:14.394
despite the best efforts
of human rights groups

18:14.427 --> 18:17.397
and an appeal
by the United Nations.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.732
We are meeting with Jamaica's
Minister of Justice,

18:19.766 --> 18:22.135
Mark Golding, to find out more.

18:22.169 --> 18:24.337
We're just wondering,
from your perspective,

18:24.371 --> 18:25.772
how you see the buggery law,

18:25.805 --> 18:27.440
because it's a symbol
that there is some sort

18:27.474 --> 18:31.378
of government-sanctioned form
of discrimination.

18:31.411 --> 18:35.515
It's a hot potato
to attempt to touch it.

18:35.548 --> 18:38.885
And the feeling is that
it would be counterproductive

18:38.918 --> 18:40.687
to have a debate like that

18:40.720 --> 18:43.690
if the result would not be
to move forward...

18:43.723 --> 18:45.358
Sure.
-...you know?

18:45.392 --> 18:48.461
It would be sort of like 2016,
a reaffirmation

18:48.495 --> 18:52.432
of an 1861, I think it is,
Victorian statute.

18:52.465 --> 18:56.536
Do you think that the buggery
law will ever be repealed?

18:56.569 --> 18:57.804
I do.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.606
-Yeah?
-I do think it will be.

18:59.639 --> 19:03.210
One thing I would say is I
believe people need to respect

19:03.243 --> 19:06.646
countries' and societies'
feelings on these issues.

19:06.679 --> 19:11.884
You know, America, for example,
only recently got to the point

19:11.918 --> 19:15.522
where gay marriage has been held
by their highest court.

19:15.555 --> 19:17.657
They have evolved
at their own pace.

19:17.690 --> 19:21.561
So countries like ours,
there's a resistance to that.

19:21.594 --> 19:24.331
We don't really see it
as the role of other countries

19:24.364 --> 19:26.399
to tell us
at what pace we must evolve.

19:26.433 --> 19:29.436
Is there any controversy
against the Pride events

19:29.469 --> 19:33.340
that are happening, and what
do you think will happen when...

19:33.373 --> 19:36.776
Um, it's the first time
Jamaica is having this done.

19:36.809 --> 19:39.646
I'm a little nervous,
I must tell you.

19:39.679 --> 19:42.749
But I would like it
to go through smoothly,

19:42.782 --> 19:44.384
without incident.

that it will go quietly.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.992
that a country can only change
at its own pace,

19:53.025 --> 19:55.762
but until then,
it isn't just the buggery law.

19:55.795 --> 19:58.531
It's the complete absence
of legal protection

19:58.565 --> 20:00.367
for queer citizens

20:00.400 --> 20:04.003
that renders them invisible
in the eyes of the government.

It's been estimated that 32,000
Jamaicans are living with HIV

20:09.342 --> 20:13.012
and as many as half of them
are unaware of their status.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.548
And of those
who know they've been infected,

20:15.582 --> 20:19.319
the power of the church, the
laws that criminalize sex acts,

20:19.352 --> 20:20.853
and the threat of violence

20:20.887 --> 20:23.790
is often enough to keep them
from seeking treatment.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.658
To learn more about this issue,

20:25.692 --> 20:27.860
we are visiting
Kandasi Levermore

20:27.894 --> 20:31.931
of the pioneering organization
Jamaica AIDS Support for Life.

20:31.964 --> 20:37.304
Our focus is bringing the
information for HIV to everyone,

20:37.337 --> 20:42.375
from HIV prevention, treatment,
care, and support services.

20:42.409 --> 20:46.546
But any type of communication
around understanding

20:46.579 --> 20:49.716
homosexuality
and sexual orientation

20:49.749 --> 20:53.986
is seen as pro-gay and
putting forward a gay agenda.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.688
And the challenge
that we have

20:55.722 --> 20:58.958
is that we cannot work
with young people.

20:58.991 --> 21:00.627
I would have to report

21:00.660 --> 21:03.696
when someone under the age of 18
comes to my clinic.

21:03.730 --> 21:05.365
-Mm.
-So there's a disparity.

21:05.398 --> 21:07.634
Because age of consent
is 16, but the age

21:07.667 --> 21:10.570
at which they can access
services on their own is 18.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.038
They can come.

21:12.071 --> 21:13.940
It's just that they have to come
with their parents.

21:13.973 --> 21:15.742
-Oh, wow.
-Now, what that does,

21:15.775 --> 21:17.810
it -- it pushes people away
from service.

21:17.844 --> 21:19.312
They don't
want to come out.

21:19.346 --> 21:21.080
So you're are young
and having sex.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.082
That alone is a challenge.
-Mm-hmm.

21:23.115 --> 21:26.519
But then you're having sex
with same sex, whoa,

21:26.553 --> 21:28.821
it's just very difficult
for them.

21:28.855 --> 21:30.823
And I imagine, even,
just the thought

21:30.857 --> 21:33.960
of coming to get treatment,
that's a risk unto itself.
-Yeah.

21:33.993 --> 21:35.895
So, we call it
the double stigma.

21:35.928 --> 21:37.664
We call it a catch-22.

21:37.697 --> 21:40.600
What is so horrific
is potentially a young man here

21:40.633 --> 21:43.336
would tell
his, you know, parents

21:43.370 --> 21:45.372
and be kicked out
of the house.

21:45.405 --> 21:46.873
In some instances,

21:46.906 --> 21:49.809
it's not just the parents
that force gay people to leave.

21:49.842 --> 21:51.511
It's the community.
-Mm.

21:51.544 --> 21:53.746
The stares, the -- the --
the -- the -- the shouts,

21:53.780 --> 21:57.417
the -- the name-calling, the
bullying activities that we see.

21:57.450 --> 21:58.851
I think, really,

21:58.885 --> 22:00.787
the biggest stumbling block
in our way as our country

22:00.820 --> 22:05.392
is stigma and discrimination
for persons living with HIV,

22:05.425 --> 22:06.793

this particular woman.

You know, I always suggest
you go and meet persons,

32:53.139 --> 32:54.673
you do it in public,
carry a friend.

32:54.706 --> 32:57.309
I didn't do the public, but
I did the carry a friend part,

you know, at least I was safe

32:59.678 --> 33:01.213

We went to meet
the -- the -- the woman.

33:02.748 --> 33:05.584
We got to her community,
gave her a call,

33:05.617 --> 33:08.087
and she says she's gonna ask
her stepbrother to come for us.

33:08.120 --> 33:09.488
So her stepbrother comes.

33:09.521 --> 33:12.158

at one point

33:12.191 --> 33:15.427
and seeing this person running
along the path towards us.

33:15.461 --> 33:18.097
He has a tam on his head and
a handkerchief up to his eyes

33:18.130 --> 33:19.531
and a gun in his hand.

33:19.565 --> 33:21.800
And I stood there
and I was like, "Jesus Christ."

33:21.833 --> 33:24.070
"Okay. Life is done"
kind of thing.

33:24.103 --> 33:28.207
And so I was forced to do
oral sex on the gunman,

33:28.240 --> 33:31.377
on the stepbrother,
and on my friend.

33:31.410 --> 33:34.346
She had to do oral sex

33:34.380 --> 33:38.217
on the gunman
and on the stepbrother.

33:39.418 --> 33:44.256
And then I had to watch
as she was raped by both men.

33:46.525 --> 33:49.161
When I got home, I went into the
house and I called the police.

33:49.195 --> 33:51.597
And I said, "What do I do
if I've been raped?"

33:51.630 --> 33:54.166
-Mm.
-The first response I got
from the police was,

33:54.200 --> 33:56.335
"You should leave this lifestyle
and go back to church."

33:56.368 --> 33:58.337
And because
that was the response,

33:58.370 --> 34:00.606
my dad helped me
and we got to the police

34:00.639 --> 34:03.242
in the parish where the rape
actually happened.

34:03.275 --> 34:05.644
And that was where
the process went forward.

34:05.677 --> 34:08.380

that your attacker faced?

34:08.414 --> 34:09.848
Out of 20-something years,

34:09.881 --> 34:12.251
only two to four years
for violating my body --

34:12.284 --> 34:15.154
only to realize in 2013
that the case was appealed

34:15.187 --> 34:17.289
and he was not --
he was not serving time.

34:17.323 --> 34:19.691
This person's out
on the streets. I was mad.

34:19.725 --> 34:21.693

on Facebook,

34:21.727 --> 34:23.662

34:23.695 --> 34:27.433

was there any backlash?

34:27.466 --> 34:28.467

34:28.500 --> 34:29.668
-No?
-Wow.

34:29.701 --> 34:31.770

"Thank you for speaking up,

34:31.803 --> 34:34.206

of your sexual orientation."

34:34.240 --> 34:36.508

34:36.542 --> 34:38.644

moving forward

or gender identity.

It's about education,
research, activism.

35:12.711 --> 35:15.514
So we've done self-defense
training, because the research

35:15.547 --> 35:18.284
said that women wanted to know
how to defend themselves.

35:18.317 --> 35:21.287

is silent protests.
