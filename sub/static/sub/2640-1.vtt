02:04.751 --> 02:06.295
I'm really excited to be here.

02:07.254 --> 02:11.216
We have something really special
to share with you today.

02:11.883 --> 02:15.887
In total, between iMac and PowerBook lines,

02:16.596 --> 02:20.225
we have sold over three million units this year.

02:25.397 --> 02:26.940
Okay. That's it.

02:28.358 --> 02:30.319
Well, maybe there's one more thing.

02:31.194 --> 02:34.197
I'm about to show you
something that's amazing.

02:34.489 --> 02:38.952
Something that no one else in the world
has seen yet.

02:39.286 --> 02:42.581
Now, Jony, myself and a small team

02:43.165 --> 02:47.252
have been working really hard
on a secret project,

02:47.836 --> 02:49.254
which is something I've been known to do

02:49.338 --> 02:50.573
from time to time.

02:51.381 --> 02:54.551
The device I'm about to introduce to you

02:54.634 --> 02:57.804
is gonna revolutionize an entire industry.

02:58.972 --> 03:00.766
It's a music playing device.

03:01.433 --> 03:02.726
Okay.

03:03.101 --> 03:04.895
We'll get to that in a minute.

03:05.437 --> 03:09.775
Because what it represents is
as important as what it is.

03:11.318 --> 03:14.905
It's a tool for the heart.

03:15.906 --> 03:20.077
And when you can touch someone's heart,

03:21.119 --> 03:22.788
that's limitless.

03:24.331 --> 03:27.250
If I do say so myself, it's insanely cool.

03:29.795 --> 03:31.463
It's a music player.

03:32.422 --> 03:38.136
It's a thousand songs in your pocket.

03:43.809 --> 03:45.435
I'd like to introduce you

03:47.312 --> 03:48.814
to the iPod.

04:29.980 --> 04:31.022
Hey, Jobs.

04:31.356 --> 04:33.108
Get up, man. Wake up.

04:35.026 --> 04:36.486
I'm up.

04:40.532 --> 04:41.867
I'm up.

04:47.956 --> 04:49.040
I'm up.

05:03.889 --> 05:04.890
Steve.

05:05.056 --> 05:07.225
- Hey, Daniel.
- Hey, what's going on?

05:07.726 --> 05:09.936
<i>- Are you reading Be Here Now?
- Yeah, it's amazing.</i>

05:10.020 --> 05:11.813
I'm reading that right now.
It's unbelievable.

05:11.897 --> 05:14.149
<i>It's the next level.
Hey, speaking of Be Here,</i>

05:14.232 --> 05:16.234
what happened to you last night?
Where'd you go?

05:16.401 --> 05:18.737
I had to study. I know, I know.

05:18.820 --> 05:21.990
You know, I'm not dismissing
the value of higher education,

05:22.073 --> 05:24.201
I'm just saying it comes
at the expense of experience.

05:24.284 --> 05:26.328
The system can only produce the system.

05:26.411 --> 05:28.413
I don't want to be a part of that.
Neither should you.

05:28.497 --> 05:31.333
I agree with you.
It takes balls to drop out like you did.

05:31.416 --> 05:33.001
That's why you should.

05:33.084 --> 05:35.003
- I mean...
- Steven.

05:36.254 --> 05:37.631
Might I borrow you for a moment?

05:38.381 --> 05:39.841
- I'll see you in, see you later.
- Sure.

05:39.925 --> 05:41.927
Thank you. Thanks.
I hope I'm not interrupting.

05:42.886 --> 05:44.095
What about your classes?

05:44.429 --> 05:45.847
I'm not a student anymore, Jack.

05:45.931 --> 05:47.682
Well, you're here, and you're learning.

05:47.766 --> 05:49.434
Sure sounds like a student to me.

05:49.851 --> 05:51.353
If you want me gone...

05:51.436 --> 05:53.188
Why would I want you gone, Steven?

05:53.688 --> 05:55.023
I'm glad that you're here.

05:55.106 --> 05:56.775
Whether you're paying or not.

05:57.192 --> 05:58.860
Now, you're always carrying
this notebook around.

05:58.944 --> 06:01.404
You obviously fancy yourself as an artist.

06:01.488 --> 06:03.865
Why don't you sit in on some design classes?

06:03.949 --> 06:08.286
No. Well, I like the idea of art, the beauty.
But only in the right context.

06:08.370 --> 06:10.413
Just not as a career.
I don't have the necessary talents.

06:10.497 --> 06:12.582
But aren't you interested in electronics?
What about engineering?

06:12.666 --> 06:16.378
There's a growing market for qualified technicians.
What about that?

06:16.461 --> 06:18.088
I don't want to spend my parents' money

06:18.171 --> 06:19.756
to get a degree and become something

06:19.839 --> 06:21.174
as forgettable as an electrician.

06:21.299 --> 06:24.344
Excuse me, what, a degree
is a waste of time now? So...

06:24.427 --> 06:30.100
For some. For others it offers validation.
Job security.

06:30.642 --> 06:31.977
- Steve...
- I'll see you around.

06:32.811 --> 06:36.523
Steven. To be continued.

06:46.950 --> 06:48.743
What are you working on?

06:50.078 --> 06:53.832
Nothing, really.
It's homework for calligraphy class.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.001
It's beautiful.

06:57.919 --> 06:59.838
Yeah, the teacher's this monk, or something.

07:01.006 --> 07:02.048
A monk?

07:02.299 --> 07:04.259
Yeah. Robert Palladino.

07:04.467 --> 07:06.678
He's totally inspiring.

07:07.887 --> 07:09.514
My name's Julie.

07:17.022 --> 07:18.189
Are you leaving?

07:18.356 --> 07:19.524
Yeah. I have to go.

07:24.195 --> 07:25.447
You want a hit?

07:26.865 --> 07:27.866
Yes.

07:29.659 --> 07:31.036
Yes, I do.

07:33.204 --> 07:34.706
Can I take a couple?

07:34.789 --> 07:36.750
- Sure.
- For my friends.

07:37.083 --> 07:40.712
Well, my friend, and my girlfriend.

07:49.763 --> 07:51.723
It's so beautiful.

07:52.766 --> 07:55.894
Like a window to the world.

07:58.480 --> 08:01.358
What do you think it's like in space?

08:02.400 --> 08:03.485
It's...

08:04.361 --> 08:06.571
beyond understanding.

08:07.864 --> 08:09.115
Yeah.

08:10.825 --> 08:13.328
Who has a baby,

08:14.746 --> 08:17.582
and then just throws it away
like it's nothing?

08:20.460 --> 08:23.004
You talking about your birth parents?

08:23.713 --> 08:26.007
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

08:26.466 --> 08:31.054
That's bad. Yeah.
That's making me really sad. I...

08:31.971 --> 08:35.850
Sorry that my life is ruining your high.

08:36.851 --> 08:38.186
It's okay.

08:41.272 --> 08:43.732
I miss you when you're not around.

08:53.284 --> 08:54.994
I love you, Steve.

08:58.248 --> 08:59.791
I love you.

09:04.379 --> 09:06.965
Space. The endless black deep.

09:07.716 --> 09:10.885
What was it that that guru
used to tell us?

09:18.560 --> 09:20.645
There is no time to waste.

09:21.020 --> 09:22.230
Do you hear that?

09:22.731 --> 09:24.149
What?

09:38.163 --> 09:39.998
There he goes again.

10:00.143 --> 10:04.606
Calligraphy is the artful
and visual expression of communication.

10:04.689 --> 10:06.649
Take Garamond, for example.

10:06.733 --> 10:11.029
A typeface specifically designed
to make the very act of reading

10:11.279 --> 10:12.781
more natural.

10:25.418 --> 10:28.797
Computers are inherently designed
to make your lives easier.

10:28.963 --> 10:32.091
Theoretically there's no limit
to what computers can do.

10:49.651 --> 10:52.320
It is not who you were at birth that matters

10:52.695 --> 10:55.740
but what you do with the time you are given.

10:56.115 --> 10:58.576
The moment of your death is fixed.

10:58.785 --> 11:02.914
Life is but a journey to serenity,
to its completion.

11:15.093 --> 11:17.095
Be as simple as you can be.

11:17.637 --> 11:19.764
You'll be astonished to see how uncomplicated

11:19.848 --> 11:21.975
<i>and happy your life can become.</i>

11:42.871 --> 11:46.332
I don't even know what I'm gonna do
when I go back home.

11:47.542 --> 11:48.835
What about you?

11:49.085 --> 11:52.088
What are you gonna do
when you get back to The Valley?

11:52.255 --> 11:53.506
Steve?

11:54.465 --> 11:56.467
Steve? You okay?

12:07.937 --> 12:12.358
No. No, no! No.
It's still black and white.

12:13.651 --> 12:15.028
People want color.

12:15.320 --> 12:17.238
<i>- Pong didn't have color.
- So?</i>

12:17.322 --> 12:18.865
Let's do something better.

12:18.948 --> 12:20.658
It can't do color.

12:20.742 --> 12:21.784
Says who?

12:22.076 --> 12:24.203
Okay, you refuse to do anything

12:24.287 --> 12:26.331
that vaguely escapes your comfort zone.

12:26.414 --> 12:27.624
You're not even my boss.

12:27.707 --> 12:28.875
Well, I damn sure should be.

12:28.958 --> 12:30.168
Hey, Jobs!

12:31.085 --> 12:32.128
What're you doing, Steve?

12:32.211 --> 12:33.254
He's an idiot.

12:33.504 --> 12:35.673
You know, and half the people around here

12:35.757 --> 12:38.134
don't know how to design shit.

12:40.678 --> 12:43.056
People are complaining about your behavior.

12:43.431 --> 12:45.099
- Okay? And, yeah.
- About mine?

12:45.183 --> 12:47.977
And your odor.

12:48.436 --> 12:49.771
Are you showering like we discussed?

12:49.854 --> 12:50.939
I'm wearing shoes. You asked me

12:51.022 --> 12:52.190
to wear shoes, and I've got them on.

12:52.273 --> 12:53.733
That's not part of the deal, Steve.

12:53.816 --> 12:55.735
You've gotta learn how to work well
with other people.

12:58.696 --> 13:00.239
I'm just trying to do it right, Al.

13:00.323 --> 13:01.532
I know you are.

13:01.616 --> 13:02.700
Then let me.

13:02.784 --> 13:04.369
Listen, Steve!

13:04.953 --> 13:07.372
You're good. You're damn good.

13:08.623 --> 13:09.874
But you're an asshole.

13:12.418 --> 13:13.461
Well, that...

13:13.544 --> 13:14.545
Hey. Let me finish.

13:15.797 --> 13:18.341
I want you here. I really do.

13:20.009 --> 13:21.552
Something's gotta change.

13:24.514 --> 13:26.307
- Give me my own project.
- What?

13:26.391 --> 13:27.892
Give me my own project.

13:28.601 --> 13:30.353
I'll do it on my own.

13:30.436 --> 13:33.606
And I'll make the best damn game
you have ever seen.

13:34.440 --> 13:35.566
You're serious.

13:38.152 --> 13:39.237
Okay, Steve.

13:40.279 --> 13:41.948
I need someone to reprogram a troublesome game.

13:42.031 --> 13:43.199
But I'm on a tight deadline.

13:43.741 --> 13:45.743
So if you can deliver,

13:46.160 --> 13:47.745
we'll pay you up to $5,000.

13:49.789 --> 13:50.924
$5,000?

13:52.834 --> 13:53.835
Okay.

13:54.293 --> 13:58.423
And as for your personal issues,
I think I may have a solution.

14:05.013 --> 14:06.723
So many circuits.

14:28.202 --> 14:30.079
Woz? Hey, it's Steve.

14:44.761 --> 14:46.471
Thanks for saving my ass.

14:48.890 --> 14:53.770
Of course. We're friends.
That's, that's what friends do.

15:00.568 --> 15:03.321
I just can't work for other people.

15:06.991 --> 15:11.746
I guess I need my independence.
If that makes any sense.

15:14.332 --> 15:16.542
That makes perfect sense.

15:21.172 --> 15:23.633
I'm sorry for ruining your Friday night.

15:25.093 --> 15:27.595
Are you kidding me? This is great.

15:28.054 --> 15:30.640
I'd do this for free. I really would.

15:31.766 --> 15:34.519
But just out of curiosity,
how much are we getting paid?

15:36.020 --> 15:37.222
$700.

15:39.565 --> 15:42.276
Some big bucks there.

15:53.663 --> 15:54.747
<i>Shit.</i>

15:55.456 --> 15:57.917
This is good. Really good.

15:58.584 --> 15:59.710
I know.

16:02.337 --> 16:04.298
Four days. You aren't kidding around.

16:04.799 --> 16:08.469
I'll have to show it to Nolan,
but this is, this is good.

16:23.943 --> 16:24.986
Woz?

16:25.069 --> 16:26.487
Hi. Hi.

16:29.031 --> 16:30.158
Woz!

16:30.241 --> 16:32.618
Hi! Yeah, I'm in the living room.

16:32.743 --> 16:34.495
Hey. Good news.

16:35.179 --> 16:36.998
Let me guess, your bosses
liked the video game.

16:37.081 --> 16:38.199
They loved it!

16:39.041 --> 16:41.294
$350... That's not bad.

16:41.377 --> 16:43.254
Not bad? It's great.

16:44.589 --> 16:45.840
What are you working on?

16:46.507 --> 16:48.509
I'm writing jokes for my dial-a-joke machine.

16:48.593 --> 16:51.929
I've got some really good funny Polish jokes,
which work because I'm Polish.

16:52.054 --> 16:53.848
Hang out and tell me
what you think of this one.

16:53.931 --> 16:55.016
Ready? Ready?

16:55.099 --> 16:58.853
<i>What is long, and hard, that a Polish bride
gets on her wedding night?</i>

16:58.936 --> 17:00.688
<i>A new last name.</i>

17:04.775 --> 17:05.859
That's hilarious.

17:05.943 --> 17:07.778
Pretty good, isn't it?

17:07.862 --> 17:10.239
What do you call a beautiful
Polish girl? Lucky.

17:14.868 --> 17:15.869
What's that?

17:21.709 --> 17:25.546
That. Now that is gonna be cool.

17:26.631 --> 17:28.633
It's a computer terminal board
I'm working on.

17:29.383 --> 17:32.303
Hooks up to the TV for the display.

17:34.096 --> 17:36.265
What is it like, a kit?
What do you mean?

17:36.724 --> 17:37.725
Well, well...

17:37.808 --> 17:38.976
The code is still buggy,

17:39.060 --> 17:42.271
but in theory it'll display
whatever you're working on. Like...

17:42.355 --> 17:43.606
Show me.

17:44.065 --> 17:45.691
Show you. Okay.

18:23.980 --> 18:26.732
<i>I don't care if HP didn't like it.
It matters.</i>

18:26.816 --> 18:28.025
<i>Yeah. It's got potential.</i>

18:28.109 --> 18:31.570
<i>No, the Sex Pistols have potential.
This is the wheel.</i>

18:31.654 --> 18:32.863
It's the Industrial Revolution.

18:32.947 --> 18:35.157
No more decks, no more mainframes.

18:35.241 --> 18:36.409
That changes everything.

18:36.492 --> 18:37.576
It's pretty cool, I guess.

18:37.660 --> 18:38.786
- Hi, Charlene. Hello.
- Hey.

18:38.869 --> 18:42.748
Cool. It's profound.
How could you not tell me about this before?

18:42.832 --> 18:45.209
I don't know. I was just working on it for my own.
It, it was a hobby.

18:45.293 --> 18:48.170
Exactly. Exactly. For your own. For you.

18:48.379 --> 18:52.300
It's what you wanted.
It's what your gut, your instinct wanted.

18:52.383 --> 18:55.344
Your big evolved brain
wanted something that didn't exist,

18:55.428 --> 18:58.222
so you just willed it into existence.

18:59.348 --> 19:00.599
It's, what do you call the system?

19:00.683 --> 19:01.726
The operating system?

19:01.851 --> 19:03.894
- The operating, and it just shows you...
- That's what I call it.

19:03.978 --> 19:06.355
Yeah, it's just a real time display
of current operations.

19:06.439 --> 19:09.483
You can see what you're working on
while you're working on it.

19:09.567 --> 19:10.818
Okay. Look...

19:10.901 --> 19:12.028
Don't you get this? This is freedom.

19:12.111 --> 19:15.656
This is freedom to create,
and to do, and to build,

19:15.781 --> 19:17.616
- as artists, as individuals.
- Look, look, look.

19:17.700 --> 19:19.535
But look, you're overreacting.

19:19.618 --> 19:23.414
Even if you were developing this
for freaks like us, and I doubt you are,

19:23.497 --> 19:26.334
nobody wants to buy a computer. Nobody.

19:26.417 --> 19:30.004
How does somebody know what they want
if they've never even seen it?

19:33.716 --> 19:35.092
We're going to Homebrew.

19:36.594 --> 19:38.095
No...

19:39.430 --> 19:41.307
I am not presenting anything at Homebrew.

19:41.390 --> 19:43.184
I'm... No.

19:45.061 --> 19:48.105
Why do people drive so slow?
Get out! Move!

19:48.189 --> 19:50.066
I'm telling you right now,
I've been to Homebrew.

19:50.149 --> 19:52.693
I understand the caliber of people
who speak there.

19:52.777 --> 19:54.236
I'm not one of those people.

19:54.362 --> 19:56.697
- I'm telling you this thing is amazing.
- I'm not...

19:56.781 --> 19:58.366
You're gonna be great, Woz.

19:58.449 --> 20:00.951
Steve, could you do me a favor,
could you just please

20:01.035 --> 20:02.536
slow down a little bit
so that I feel like

20:02.620 --> 20:05.581
there's a chance we might
actually get there alive.

20:05.664 --> 20:08.125
I want to get there first
so we present first.

20:09.794 --> 20:11.045
You know if we're gonna do this thing,

20:11.128 --> 20:12.254
we need to come up with a name.

20:12.380 --> 20:14.006
- Yeah, I know.
- Something catchy. Something...

20:14.131 --> 20:15.257
I've been thinking about it.

20:15.341 --> 20:16.467
electric.

20:16.884 --> 20:19.011
It needs to feel like...
I don't know.

20:19.136 --> 20:21.180
What about Enterprise Computers?

20:21.263 --> 20:22.264
No.

20:22.348 --> 20:23.849
<i>No Star Trek names. I swear.</i>

20:23.933 --> 20:25.142
What about Kirk Enterprises?

20:25.226 --> 20:26.394
I will drive this car
right off this road.

20:26.477 --> 20:27.478
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine!

20:27.561 --> 20:28.729
I will run the car
right off the road.

20:28.813 --> 20:30.731
Jesus! Calm down! Seriously.

20:30.815 --> 20:32.983
Okay. Nothing Trekkie. Jesus.

20:33.317 --> 20:36.946
It just needs to be, like,
something that people will relate to, you know?

20:37.029 --> 20:38.739
Like, it needs to be something that you see,

20:38.823 --> 20:41.575
and you're just, like,
"Man, I just gotta have it."

20:45.246 --> 20:46.414
Apple.

20:47.331 --> 20:48.624
Excuse me?

20:50.000 --> 20:52.169
- Apple.
- Apple, like the fruit?

20:52.420 --> 20:55.923
The fruit of creation. Apple.
It's simple but sophisticated.

20:56.006 --> 20:58.676
It comes before Atari in the phone book, too.

20:58.759 --> 21:04.014
That is so much better
than Phaser Beam Computers.

21:05.099 --> 21:06.767
It's naming it after a fruit.

21:06.851 --> 21:08.477
Apple. Apple Computer.

21:09.186 --> 21:11.063
But, what about Apple Records?

21:11.522 --> 21:13.274
- Apple Records?
- The Beatles' label, stu...

21:13.357 --> 21:14.775
What, they own the word "apple"?

21:14.859 --> 21:16.026
Why do you always hate The Beatles?

21:16.110 --> 21:17.153
Well, I do not hate The Beatles.

21:17.278 --> 21:18.988
- Yes, you do. You always...
- I do not hate The Beatles.

21:19.071 --> 21:20.990
They're just, they're not Dylan,
and you know that.

21:21.073 --> 21:23.033
Okay, and that's a comparison
that you always make.

21:23.117 --> 21:24.285
Well, I... 'Cause it's obvious.

21:24.368 --> 21:25.536
And I don't think it's fair.

21:26.704 --> 21:28.414
Apple. Really? Apple?

21:29.206 --> 21:31.667
Right, listen. If we come up with
something better, we'll change it.

21:31.750 --> 21:34.545
Let's just go with it
and see if it sticks.

21:43.053 --> 21:47.057
<i>It will display up to 192 memory locations</i>

21:47.141 --> 21:49.477
<i>on the monitor simultaneously.</i>

21:50.102 --> 21:54.607
Allow me to explain because
it's quite fascinating, actually.

21:56.567 --> 21:59.403
The logic board is rather complex,
especially compared to some of

22:00.404 --> 22:02.740
the other boards here,
including of course,

22:03.407 --> 22:05.493
the Altair.

22:07.828 --> 22:09.038
And as you can see...

22:09.455 --> 22:13.209
it's much smaller, and cheaper
to manufacture and build...

22:13.667 --> 22:17.379
which, by using dynamic RAM, I was able...

22:18.756 --> 22:23.260
We were able to shrink
the size of the board substantially.

22:23.344 --> 22:25.262
So, it works with your television?

22:25.346 --> 22:27.097
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

22:27.598 --> 22:31.352
It will work on any television,
or video monitor.

22:31.435 --> 22:35.022
All you need is a radio frequency converter

22:35.856 --> 22:38.901
to display the images from your microprocessor

22:38.984 --> 22:40.986
to your set output device.

22:42.613 --> 22:44.448
And it'll run BASIC.

22:48.035 --> 22:52.289
It will also run BASIC,
which I think could be a great...

22:53.541 --> 22:57.378
So I guess that wraps it up.
Thank you very much for your time.

22:57.628 --> 23:00.839
This was terrific. Fuck.

23:01.632 --> 23:03.133
Tough crowd.

23:05.427 --> 23:06.887
Good evening, gentlemen. I'm Frank.

23:06.971 --> 23:08.013
I'm Lutz.

23:08.097 --> 23:12.142
And we're here with reduced instruction
set computing CPU.

23:19.483 --> 23:22.903
Excuse me. Name is Paul Terrell.

23:25.072 --> 23:26.490
Saw your presentation.

23:26.949 --> 23:27.992
And?

23:28.075 --> 23:29.702
And I'd like to talk business.

23:31.370 --> 23:33.247
- What can I do for you?
- Well...

23:33.330 --> 23:36.584
I own a local computer parts store,
in Mountain View.

23:36.667 --> 23:37.793
The Byte Shop?

23:37.876 --> 23:39.086
You buy computer parts.

23:39.169 --> 23:42.631
Yeah. We sell transistors, boards,
soldering equipment, monitors.

23:42.715 --> 23:44.174
You know, hobbyist types.

23:44.258 --> 23:45.384
Like Radio Shack?

23:46.010 --> 23:47.177
No.

23:47.344 --> 23:51.140
Listen, why don't you stop by
and talk to me some time.

23:51.223 --> 23:53.434
There's my card. Give me a call.

23:54.059 --> 23:55.102
Great.

23:55.185 --> 23:56.478
It was nice meeting you.

23:56.979 --> 23:58.063
Steve Jobs.

23:58.188 --> 23:59.648
Steve Jobs. All right.

24:03.777 --> 24:05.362
Who was that?

24:06.614 --> 24:07.965
It's Paul Terrell.

24:09.742 --> 24:11.118
Who?

24:47.446 --> 24:49.657
So what kind of investment
are we talking about here?

24:49.740 --> 24:53.535
Jesus, Steve.
I said I was interested, not buying.

24:53.619 --> 24:57.081
I know. But you're also
not the only interested party.

24:57.164 --> 24:58.874
- Oh, really? I'm not?
- No.

24:58.957 --> 25:00.000
You're not.

25:00.084 --> 25:01.168
That's interesting.

25:01.251 --> 25:03.379
Because it sure seemed that way
the other night at Homebrew.

25:03.462 --> 25:06.090
You think that's the first stop
that we made?

25:06.882 --> 25:08.300
We've been all over The Valley.

25:08.384 --> 25:11.595
Oh, well, then you already have a retailer.

25:11.929 --> 25:12.930
I got offers.

25:13.013 --> 25:17.351
Look, Paul. My middle name's Paul.
My dad's name is Paul.

25:17.476 --> 25:19.228
Bunch of Pauls. I'm...

25:19.311 --> 25:20.813
I think we're kindred spirits here.

25:21.605 --> 25:24.483
We're both businessmen
that operate from our gut.

25:25.067 --> 25:28.070
And my gut tells me to give you this opportunity.

25:32.074 --> 25:36.704
I'm thinking $400 per machine, for 50 units,
paid at the time of delivery.

25:38.789 --> 25:40.791
$400 for a hundred units,
a third up front.

25:40.874 --> 25:42.000
We're not negotiating.

25:42.084 --> 25:43.127
Yes, we are.

25:45.921 --> 25:51.427
Okay. I'll pay $450 per machine. $450.

25:52.344 --> 25:56.223
On delivery, nothing up front.
I know it's asking a lot, Steve.

25:56.306 --> 25:58.892
But it's a big payoff if you deliver.

25:59.309 --> 26:00.978
When I deliver.

26:04.648 --> 26:07.359
$500 per unit and you've got a deal.

26:10.654 --> 26:13.741
All right. You got 90 days.

26:14.992 --> 26:16.535
I'll have it in 60.

26:22.082 --> 26:24.877
Daniel and I just didn't have room
at our place, so...

26:24.960 --> 26:26.920
No, no. I'm glad you asked.

26:29.673 --> 26:32.426
We could move some things around,
give it a good cleaning.

26:32.509 --> 26:35.262
I could move most of my tools to the shed.

26:35.846 --> 26:37.639
Maybe get you boys a fan
when it gets hot.

26:40.309 --> 26:41.977
What do you think?

26:42.519 --> 26:43.854
It's great, Dad.

26:43.937 --> 26:46.482
Yes. It is. This is perfect.

26:46.565 --> 26:50.235
Good. Well, it'll be good
to see you building something.

26:51.028 --> 26:56.158
Good. Hey, keep it neat.

26:56.867 --> 26:57.951
Inside and out.

26:59.411 --> 27:00.596
Thanks, Mr. J.

27:06.919 --> 27:08.253
We got a shop.

27:08.796 --> 27:10.923
Yes, we do.

27:25.229 --> 27:26.313
How's it going?

27:32.611 --> 27:33.779
<i>And voilà.</i>

27:35.697 --> 27:39.159
It's gotta be straighter.
These have to be more symmetrical.

27:40.369 --> 27:42.037
We have 60 days to complete 50 of these,

27:42.120 --> 27:43.539
and you're worried about the symmetry?

27:43.622 --> 27:46.041
Steve, nobody cares
about the look of the board.

27:46.124 --> 27:48.085
- I care.
- Well, that's just great.

27:48.335 --> 27:50.754
But we were out of time
the minute you made that stupid promise.

27:53.799 --> 27:54.925
You're right.

27:56.510 --> 27:58.095
Need help.

28:00.180 --> 28:01.223
Woz.

28:02.391 --> 28:03.551
We got a problem.

28:05.477 --> 28:07.896
We got to figure out what to do
with all these employees.

28:09.231 --> 28:10.274
- You know Bill?
- Bill.

28:10.357 --> 28:12.025
- Too long, Woz.
- How are you?

28:12.109 --> 28:13.360
Good to see you. How is everyone?

28:13.443 --> 28:14.570
Oh, this is my friend Daniel Kottke.

28:14.653 --> 28:15.988
Hey. I've heard a lot about you.
How're you doing?

28:16.405 --> 28:19.741
Kottke? Kottke from India, of course.

28:19.825 --> 28:21.201
I've heard a lot about you, too.

28:21.285 --> 28:22.953
Don't touch that.

28:23.245 --> 28:25.914
That's Chris Espinosa.
Kid down the street I was telling you about?

28:25.998 --> 28:28.166
Nice to meet you, fella.
This is gonna be so cool.

28:28.750 --> 28:31.962
Great. I'm so glad that you're excited

28:32.045 --> 28:33.630
about this thing we're doing here.

28:33.714 --> 28:34.840
Can I talk to you for a second?

28:34.923 --> 28:35.966
Yeah.

28:36.049 --> 28:38.719
Excuse me, just please stop.
And go over there.

28:38.802 --> 28:41.138
Just out of the way, over there.

28:46.184 --> 28:50.355
We can't afford to pay three people right now.

28:52.107 --> 28:56.361
We can't afford to pay ourselves,
unless we deliver.

28:57.195 --> 29:00.449
And don't worry about Chris. He's just a kid.
So he just wants to help.

29:02.784 --> 29:03.911
You're just a kid.

29:04.786 --> 29:06.038
Cheese!

29:09.625 --> 29:11.001
Thanks, Mom.

29:11.877 --> 29:13.295
So embarrassing.

30:32.708 --> 30:34.876
- All right.
- As promised.

30:36.169 --> 30:38.005
Nice board.

30:45.637 --> 30:46.847
Where's the rest?

30:47.931 --> 30:50.183
The rest? This is all of them.

30:50.642 --> 30:52.185
I asked for 50 computers.

30:52.269 --> 30:56.023
That's keyboards, cases, monitors,
and power included.

30:56.106 --> 30:57.899
Not just boards.

30:58.316 --> 31:02.612
Just boards? Excuse me? Just boards?
These are state-of-the-art.

31:02.696 --> 31:06.992
The logic boards alone are...
Nobody's making anything like this.

31:07.075 --> 31:09.745
They're, what, how dare you!
How dare you!

31:09.828 --> 31:13.623
I think what my colleague is saying is that...

31:14.541 --> 31:16.835
You're not seeing the possibilities here.

31:16.918 --> 31:20.047
That is indeed one unbelievably
kick ass computer.

31:20.130 --> 31:22.090
Not to the consumer.

31:22.174 --> 31:23.467
Well, then maybe your consumer

31:23.550 --> 31:25.093
should start to learn how to...

31:25.177 --> 31:26.303
How to even work that, don't you think?

31:26.386 --> 31:28.013
Listen, boys.

31:28.430 --> 31:33.060
You sold me on a home computer.
That's a keyboard and monitor.

31:33.143 --> 31:34.686
This is a board.

31:35.187 --> 31:37.064
Now, I'm sure this makes
a very capable starter kit,

31:37.147 --> 31:38.565
but the everyday person,

31:38.648 --> 31:40.692
the kind of person that's not an engineer,

31:40.776 --> 31:42.944
or in a computer club like you,

31:43.028 --> 31:45.405
they're not gonna know
what the hell this is.

31:45.489 --> 31:48.617
The average Joe doesn't want to build
their own computer.

31:48.700 --> 31:50.035
They just want to buy it.

31:50.118 --> 31:52.454
They want to take it out of the box,
plug it in,

31:52.537 --> 31:54.372
and have it work.

31:54.581 --> 31:55.624
Steve.

31:56.875 --> 31:58.794
Are you listening to me?

31:59.252 --> 32:03.507
Yeah. These are your boards.

32:04.674 --> 32:06.384
And they will sell.

32:06.468 --> 32:08.845
I can promise you that.

32:09.846 --> 32:11.640
You saw our demo at Homebrew.

32:11.723 --> 32:13.767
You know what it's capable of
with the right components,

32:13.850 --> 32:17.062
which, by the way, all of which you sell.

32:19.397 --> 32:21.525
So, demo it to the consumer.

32:21.608 --> 32:23.735
And market the components separately.

32:23.860 --> 32:26.029
You show them your keyboards,
and your monitors.

32:26.113 --> 32:27.739
You'll move more inventory that way,

32:27.823 --> 32:29.658
and you'll make a hell
of a lot more cash.

32:31.868 --> 32:33.286
You got me.

32:38.166 --> 32:39.626
All right, Steve.

32:40.335 --> 32:41.503
I'll try to sell them.

32:42.546 --> 32:46.299
But if I don't,
I'm not making another order.

32:46.383 --> 32:48.468
Okay. That's fine.

32:48.552 --> 32:52.055
But I think that you might be really interested
in our second model.

32:52.139 --> 32:53.849
What's the second model?

32:55.100 --> 32:57.144
What are you talking about?

32:58.645 --> 33:00.063
All-in-one.

33:33.180 --> 33:34.681
Can I help you?

33:34.764 --> 33:36.266
Yeah, I'm Rod Holt.

33:37.726 --> 33:40.312
The technician. We talked on the phone.

33:40.687 --> 33:42.981
Of course. It's Rod.

33:46.943 --> 33:48.862
Glad you could stop by.

33:50.197 --> 33:52.115
Welcome to Apple Computer.

33:54.701 --> 33:56.161
All right.

33:58.413 --> 34:01.333
Show me this revolutionary piece of shit.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.376
The Apple II.

34:04.836 --> 34:08.465
It's the first ever all-in-one
personal home computer.

34:09.132 --> 34:10.300
And you called me because?

34:11.801 --> 34:16.097
We need a heat efficient power supply.
In the case.

34:16.505 --> 34:18.641
That's impossible, but don't mind me.

34:18.725 --> 34:20.685
I'm just, you know, an engineer.

34:21.268 --> 34:22.395
What's the wattage?

34:22.478 --> 34:24.773
40 watts. And quiet.

34:25.607 --> 34:27.650
- What the hell do you mean, quiet?
- I mean silent.

34:27.775 --> 34:29.610
There's no such thing.

34:29.985 --> 34:32.405
These things run hot.
They need fans in them.

34:32.489 --> 34:33.822
Those bitches ain't quiet.

34:36.076 --> 34:38.078
That's exactly why we need you.

34:38.911 --> 34:40.455
To redesign it.

34:40.996 --> 34:42.206
Redesign what?

34:42.290 --> 34:44.583
The power supply. From scratch.

34:46.127 --> 34:48.797
It can't have a fan, it can't overheat.

34:49.005 --> 34:52.676
And it needs to fit inside a box this size.

35:03.353 --> 35:06.106
Don't do that. Please, don't do...

35:06.189 --> 35:08.525
Whatever. Do whatever you want.

35:19.202 --> 35:21.037
My rate is $200 a day.

35:21.454 --> 35:23.957
And if I ever think things
aren't working out, I walk.

35:25.375 --> 35:26.668
Are we clear?

35:27.711 --> 35:29.170
We're clear.

35:32.549 --> 35:34.342
We're talking about the future.

35:34.426 --> 35:37.220
We're working in a market
that doesn't even exist yet.

35:37.721 --> 35:39.806
What Intel has done for the microprocessor,

35:40.056 --> 35:42.600
we are gonna do for the home computer.

35:46.604 --> 35:49.190
How can you not know
what I'm talking about?

35:52.360 --> 35:55.780
No, ma'am. But it runs on a TV monitor.

35:57.073 --> 35:59.743
Yes, like a television set. Exactly.

36:00.452 --> 36:04.748
I don't think you understand. It's not a TV.
It's a personal computer.

36:05.373 --> 36:07.667
Okay, do you own a typewriter?

36:08.251 --> 36:11.963
Great. Okay, now do you use it? Perfect.

36:12.088 --> 36:16.509
So imagine combining your typewriter
with your television set.

36:19.220 --> 36:21.181
No. Don't... Wait. Wait!

36:21.264 --> 36:24.100
Wait. Please, sir, don't, don't hang up.

36:25.894 --> 36:29.939
Yes. We are small right now, but we...

36:31.274 --> 36:34.235
How do you know we're working
out of our garage?

36:34.444 --> 36:36.404
Who told you that?

36:42.077 --> 36:43.953
Yes. Yes.

36:44.120 --> 36:46.539
Well, thank you for taking the time.

36:49.125 --> 36:52.545
Yes, sir. Apple Computer.

36:53.797 --> 36:56.883
Apple? Yes, like the fruit.

36:59.302 --> 37:00.637
Who's that?

37:02.472 --> 37:06.142
No. No. All I'm asking is
that you come visit us.

37:06.559 --> 37:09.771
One meeting and I promise
you'll be on board.

37:10.688 --> 37:13.775
Around $50,000 would be my guess.

37:15.610 --> 37:16.945
Hello?

37:24.494 --> 37:26.162
What did they say?

37:48.476 --> 37:50.854
What the hell is the matter with people?

37:51.229 --> 37:52.522
Take it the call went well.

37:54.816 --> 37:58.194
I would say I hope you choke,
but that burrito is gonna kill you either way.

37:58.361 --> 37:59.821
Oh, come on, Steve.

37:59.904 --> 38:01.739
Cool your jets, man.

38:02.240 --> 38:03.324
Excuse you?

38:03.825 --> 38:05.994
Just, you know, you're so stressed, you know?

38:06.077 --> 38:08.037
It's, like, relax for a change.

38:08.413 --> 38:11.541
For a change... Why? Why?
So I can be more like you two assholes?

38:11.624 --> 38:15.128
Hey. I'm studying integrated
circuit design here, man.

38:15.211 --> 38:16.379
Are you?

38:17.839 --> 38:19.007
We each do our part.

38:19.090 --> 38:22.719
Really? Then why do I suddenly feel
like your part is expendable?

38:24.053 --> 38:27.682
Out here smokin' up like we're in India.
Well, wake up! We're not.

38:30.685 --> 38:31.769
What happened to you?

38:32.020 --> 38:33.521
- You used to be...
- What? I used to be what?

38:33.605 --> 38:35.190
- Motivated.
- I am motivated.

38:35.273 --> 38:36.566
Really? Then show me.

38:37.066 --> 38:38.943
This is a business, Daniel.

38:39.277 --> 38:41.863
And I can't help you
if you don't help yourself.

38:43.615 --> 38:46.242
I'm in there making a hundred phone calls.

38:46.326 --> 38:48.870
Rod is slaving away.

38:49.245 --> 38:51.080
The kid always finds something to do,

38:51.164 --> 38:52.415
and God knows Woz pulls his weight.

38:52.499 --> 38:53.541
Thank you.

38:53.625 --> 38:55.084
And that's a whole lot of weight.

38:55.168 --> 38:57.587
That really...
That kind of hurts my feelings.

39:11.142 --> 39:14.270
Is this the right...

39:15.730 --> 39:16.856
Apple Computer?

39:17.815 --> 39:19.400
- Yeah, this is us.
- Yeah.

39:19.484 --> 39:20.610
You expecting something else?

39:22.737 --> 39:26.908
Uh, no. Well, yeah, maybe something
a little less Manson Family.

39:28.368 --> 39:29.702
- It's a startup.
- Yeah.

39:30.036 --> 39:31.496
I'm Mike Markkula.

39:32.497 --> 39:33.998
Steve. Jobs.

39:34.249 --> 39:36.209
Steve. I heard a lot about you.

39:36.417 --> 39:38.836
You spoke to Don Valentine on the phone.

39:38.920 --> 39:40.588
He and I are old colleagues of sorts.

39:41.089 --> 39:42.882
The VC from Atari.

39:43.007 --> 39:45.802
Yeah, Valentine.
He said you called him 150 times.

39:45.885 --> 39:47.220
Jesus.

39:47.303 --> 39:50.223
He practically begged me to come
and look at your outfit here.

39:50.306 --> 39:51.724
Called in a personal favor.

39:52.559 --> 39:53.643
Well, Mark.

39:53.726 --> 39:54.811
Mike.

39:54.894 --> 39:56.354
Mike.

39:58.189 --> 39:59.649
Welcome to Apple Computer.

40:00.358 --> 40:02.652
Thank you. Yeah, is this...

40:03.486 --> 40:04.487
This is everything?

40:04.571 --> 40:05.822
- Yes.
- No.

40:05.905 --> 40:08.283
No. We're, we're in six stores
in the greater area.

40:08.783 --> 40:11.327
We'll be launching the Apple II
in about a month.

40:11.411 --> 40:13.413
- In a few months.
- It's close.

40:13.496 --> 40:16.666
Gentlemen, is there some place we can talk?

40:21.671 --> 40:23.089
Here you are, fellas.

40:23.590 --> 40:24.757
For you.

40:25.925 --> 40:29.304
Steve's a fruitarian.
He will only eat fruit.

40:30.471 --> 40:33.433
Okay, boys. I'll leave you to your business.

40:33.516 --> 40:34.559
Thank you.

40:34.684 --> 40:36.311
- Thanks, Mom.
- Thanks, Mrs. J.

40:36.394 --> 40:37.645
You're the best.

40:37.729 --> 40:41.065
Yeah. So where were we?

40:41.149 --> 40:45.028
I'm sorry, don't take this the wrong way,
but what's your angle?

40:46.237 --> 40:47.780
What my colleague is trying to say is...

40:47.864 --> 40:49.198
Where was your last employment?

40:54.037 --> 40:55.079
Intel.

40:58.207 --> 40:59.626
So how much are we talking about here?

40:59.792 --> 41:01.628
- What, the investment?
- That's what you came here for.

41:01.711 --> 41:03.838
Foreplay is not Steve's strong suit.

41:03.921 --> 41:05.131
Isn't it?

41:06.215 --> 41:07.634
Yeah, well,

41:09.427 --> 41:13.556
I've been looking for something
to really sink my teeth into.

41:21.439 --> 41:24.067
Look, Steve. I'm willing to take the risk.

41:24.651 --> 41:27.070
And, this certainly qualifies.

41:27.362 --> 41:29.238
But risk disguised as promise.

41:29.405 --> 41:31.616
And you've shown promise.
I've seen it in your eye,

41:31.741 --> 41:33.910
and I know that look
because I've had it myself.

41:35.244 --> 41:37.205
Tells me you're on to something big.

41:45.088 --> 41:46.923
Yeah. Okay. To the point.

41:47.090 --> 41:48.925
I think we should start
with around 90 grand,

41:49.008 --> 41:51.094
see where that takes us.

41:52.595 --> 41:55.556
Okay, I'm sorry. Could you repeat that?

41:55.640 --> 41:56.933
I'm sorry.

41:57.600 --> 41:59.394
$90,000 isn't gonna get it done.

42:00.177 --> 42:01.646
Wait. Steve, one second.

42:01.771 --> 42:03.981
I don't see anybody else
coming in your garage with a checkbook.

42:04.107 --> 42:05.274
Oh, no, no.

42:05.358 --> 42:07.777
Ninety grand gets it done for us.

42:07.860 --> 42:10.196
I just don't think it gets it done for you.

42:11.364 --> 42:13.616
We'll do the $90,000 investment.

42:13.700 --> 42:15.910
At a $300,000 valuation.

42:15.993 --> 42:18.454
But I also want you to kick
in a $250,000 credit line

42:18.538 --> 42:20.873
with 10% interest to be paid back in full

42:20.957 --> 42:23.626
once we meet net revenue positive.

42:32.969 --> 42:34.137
Okay.

42:38.516 --> 42:39.767
What I mean is, okay.

42:42.103 --> 42:43.187
Yeah.

42:45.314 --> 42:47.400
Now, the first thing you need to do

42:47.483 --> 42:51.487
is incorporate, so that you two as owners
can protect your interest.

42:53.197 --> 42:56.451
And that is, of course,
if you'll have me aboard.

42:58.536 --> 42:59.829
Thank you very much, Mr. Markkula.

42:59.912 --> 43:01.706
Of course. Mike. Yeah.

43:01.831 --> 43:02.999
- How're you doing?
- Yeah, put her there.

43:03.082 --> 43:04.333
- Bill.
- Bill?

43:04.417 --> 43:05.418
- Fernandez.
- Yeah.

43:05.501 --> 43:07.003
- Oh, thanks, Mike.
- Yeah.

43:07.086 --> 43:09.130
Steve. Here's to you, pal.

43:20.475 --> 43:22.393
<i>Are you even listening to me?</i>

43:23.019 --> 43:24.645
I'm pregnant.

43:27.857 --> 43:29.442
Steve, you have to talk to me.

43:31.235 --> 43:33.529
This is your responsibility, too.

43:36.240 --> 43:37.867
Don't you dare

43:38.618 --> 43:39.869
blame this on me.

43:42.747 --> 43:43.840
I'm not.

43:45.875 --> 43:49.212
We both had our moments of...

43:49.754 --> 43:51.255
What? What the hell are you talking about?

43:51.380 --> 43:52.548
You.

43:52.799 --> 43:58.763
When I was in India,
you were with, you know.

43:59.096 --> 44:01.766
Steve? Are you crazy?
You cannot put this all on me.

44:01.849 --> 44:05.311
You can't do this to me right now.
Not now.

44:05.728 --> 44:08.064
Well, I'm sorry this isn't part of your plan.

44:08.147 --> 44:10.483
I'm sorry you have a problem.

44:11.943 --> 44:13.611
But it's not happening to me.

44:14.070 --> 44:16.239
- But this is your...
- No!

44:19.408 --> 44:20.451
Get out of my house.

44:20.743 --> 44:21.953
- What?
- Now!

44:25.790 --> 44:27.583
Oh, Jesus. Here we go.

44:37.343 --> 44:39.971
Hey. Is everything okay out here?

44:40.763 --> 44:43.641
Steven, he's kicking me out.

44:45.768 --> 44:47.937
He doesn't want anything to do with me.

44:52.316 --> 44:54.610
Maybe it's for the best.

44:54.694 --> 44:57.947
You don't deserve to be treated
the way he treats you.

44:58.114 --> 44:59.949
I'm pregnant, Daniel.

45:00.825 --> 45:02.076
What? You're...

45:03.536 --> 45:06.038
He says it's not his,
but I would never...

45:10.376 --> 45:11.919
What did I do wrong?

45:16.757 --> 45:18.009
You didn't do anything wrong.

45:19.927 --> 45:21.178
It's Steve.

45:22.179 --> 45:23.806
That's just him.

45:27.852 --> 45:29.186
He changed.

46:49.183 --> 46:51.769
Hook them right to your television.

46:59.276 --> 47:00.987
His, yeah.

47:07.410 --> 47:09.704
What do you think, J? Ready?

47:23.300 --> 47:26.095
Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Steve Jobs.

47:27.138 --> 47:28.973
When I founded this company,

47:29.432 --> 47:31.225
I had one goal in mind.

47:31.809 --> 47:35.187
And that was to do what nobody else
considered possible.

47:35.896 --> 47:38.232
To put the power and the beauty

47:38.315 --> 47:40.609
of the world's most advanced technology

47:41.068 --> 47:44.613
in the hands and homes of people
just like you and me.

47:45.448 --> 47:48.409
And I can promise you that after today,

47:49.285 --> 47:52.038
you will never look at computers
the same way again.

47:53.205 --> 47:57.293
So I am proud to introduce to you,
and the world,

47:57.960 --> 48:00.588
the future of personal computing.

48:01.422 --> 48:03.924
The revolutionary Apple II.

49:25.965 --> 49:30.010
Gotta just start over.
It has to be intuitive.

49:30.678 --> 49:33.973
Precognitive. I mean,
I want it to know what you want to do

49:34.056 --> 49:35.891
before you even know
you want to do it.

49:36.016 --> 49:37.810
Wait, are we still talking
about the command prompts?

49:37.893 --> 49:41.230
Bill, we're talking about everything.
The whole thing.

49:41.856 --> 49:45.734
Lisa. Guys, it's the future.
I'm telling you right now.

49:45.818 --> 49:49.697
I mean, Lisa's gonna do for the next 10 years

49:49.780 --> 49:51.824
what the Apple II did for the last three.

49:52.241 --> 49:54.076
I can tell you that right now.

49:54.660 --> 49:56.912
Do you know why people buy an Apple?

49:57.329 --> 49:59.748
Why do they buy an Apple,
not the competitor?

50:01.584 --> 50:03.085
Because it's got bravado.

50:03.752 --> 50:05.504
It's social status.

50:05.588 --> 50:07.006
No, you know what?
It's even more than that.

50:07.089 --> 50:08.424
It's social currency.

50:09.091 --> 50:10.676
We've raised the bar.

50:11.051 --> 50:16.515
And if we want to stay there,
we gotta risk everything.

50:17.600 --> 50:22.938
Great artists, Dylan, Picasso, Newton,
they risk failure.

50:23.606 --> 50:27.234
And if we want to be great,
we've gotta risk it, too.

50:27.735 --> 50:28.819
On the command bar?

50:28.903 --> 50:29.945
On everything.

50:29.987 --> 50:32.156
- What...
- And it starts with the little things.

50:32.239 --> 50:33.866
There's over 20 different functions

50:33.949 --> 50:36.327
tied to every single variation
of the command bar,

50:36.410 --> 50:38.495
which by the way, takes weeks to program.

50:38.579 --> 50:41.790
We're not doing anything that IBM's
not already doing.

50:42.708 --> 50:45.461
And I would rather gamble on our vision

50:45.961 --> 50:48.714
than make a me-too product.

50:48.797 --> 50:52.843
We got to make the small things
just unforgettable.

50:53.344 --> 50:55.596
Let's just start with something simple.
LisaWrite.

50:55.679 --> 50:58.474
What happens if I click
on one of these tabs?

50:58.557 --> 51:01.143
You get a drop-down menu,
and then there's preferences,

51:01.227 --> 51:02.436
and page options.

51:02.519 --> 51:04.063
Okay. Exactly.

51:04.897 --> 51:09.610
Now, which tab do I click on
to get different font styles?

51:14.031 --> 51:19.161
How many custom typefaces
are there on LisaWrite?

51:20.496 --> 51:23.123
That's actually something that I wanted
to talk to you about, Steve, is...

51:23.207 --> 51:25.167
I've been asking for the fonts for months.

51:25.251 --> 51:27.461
But everything we're talking about is conceptual.

51:27.544 --> 51:32.383
And I'm sorry, but typeface,
it isn't exactly a pressing issue right now.

51:34.385 --> 51:37.846
Everything is a pressing issue.

51:39.014 --> 51:42.851
If we want to make
the vision for Lisa a reality,

51:43.852 --> 51:47.189
we gotta put in the hours
and make something great.

51:47.273 --> 51:50.317
Yeah, but we have a hard date
on this software,

51:50.401 --> 51:53.237
and I'm sorry, but adding pretty fonts
is not gonna change that.

51:54.780 --> 51:55.906
Well, Bill?

51:57.366 --> 52:00.953
If you don't share our enthusiasm,

52:01.704 --> 52:05.499
and care for the vision of this company...

52:05.582 --> 52:07.293
No, no, no, no.
I just, I'm not understanding...

52:07.376 --> 52:08.752
- Get out.
- What?

52:10.212 --> 52:12.256
- Get your shit and get out.
- What, wait...

52:12.339 --> 52:13.799
- You're done.
- What, you...

52:13.882 --> 52:15.134
What, are you gonna,
you're gonna fire me?

52:15.217 --> 52:16.343
No!

52:16.427 --> 52:18.429
I already fired you!

52:19.930 --> 52:21.974
Why are you still here?

52:29.773 --> 52:32.234
Steve, he was our best programmer
in the division.

52:32.318 --> 52:35.821
He's the best programmer
that doesn't care about our vision.

52:36.864 --> 52:38.782
Okay. Look, I know it's not my place
to say it, but...

52:38.866 --> 52:40.492
Then shut the hell up, Bill!

52:40.743 --> 52:41.785
Yeah.

52:42.328 --> 52:44.330
So sorry to interrupt you, Mr. Jobs,

52:44.413 --> 52:47.041
but your attorney is here for your 8:00.

52:47.750 --> 52:49.126
All right.

52:51.045 --> 52:53.589
I want to see samples this afternoon.

52:53.672 --> 52:58.969
Somehow we managed to design a word processor
that doesn't have fonts.

52:59.720 --> 53:02.097
And it can't happen again.

53:03.474 --> 53:05.184
So fix it!

53:19.073 --> 53:22.201
2:00 to 3:00. And your 10:00 is waiting for you.

53:25.788 --> 53:27.498
Steve. Steve, hey.

53:27.998 --> 53:29.958
Daniel. Hey.

53:30.042 --> 53:32.336
Do you have a second to talk?

53:35.047 --> 53:37.049
I thought we rescheduled.

53:37.466 --> 53:39.343
It'll only take a second.

53:40.177 --> 53:41.595
That's what everyone says.

53:41.678 --> 53:42.763
Steve.

53:48.602 --> 53:49.812
Fine.

53:50.979 --> 53:54.608
I don't have a lunch, so,
meet me at Good Earth at noon.

53:55.317 --> 53:56.902
- Okay. Cool.
- Okay.

53:57.611 --> 53:58.821
What are you working on these days?

54:00.781 --> 54:02.950
Apple II Plus repairs, mainly.

54:04.368 --> 54:05.536
Right.

54:13.627 --> 54:14.920
<i>I need you to sign this.</i>

54:15.003 --> 54:16.505
<i>It legally preserves your visitation rights.</i>

54:16.588 --> 54:20.968
<i>I don't want them.
Lisa Brennan is not my child.</i>

54:21.552 --> 54:23.137
<i>The courts disagree.</i>

54:23.220 --> 54:27.433
Chris-Ann is a lunatic. It's impossible.
At the very least, improbable.

54:27.516 --> 54:28.767
You knew going into this

54:28.851 --> 54:31.854
the paternity test could prove
that you were the father.

54:32.563 --> 54:34.314
There are 24 million people in California.

54:34.398 --> 54:36.108
That test has a five percent margin of error.

54:36.191 --> 54:39.528
That's 1.2 million people
that could be the father of that child.

54:39.611 --> 54:41.488
It's not me.

54:43.198 --> 54:47.244
You don't need to convince me.
But you do need to sign this.

54:47.828 --> 54:50.622
Miss Brennan is entitled
to your child support

54:50.706 --> 54:53.500
regardless of whether you sign it or not.

54:53.792 --> 54:57.045
Do you really want to give up
the rights to see your...

54:57.129 --> 54:59.840
To see her child in the future?

54:59.923 --> 55:01.800
I don't have time.

55:02.384 --> 55:03.427
Not now.

55:03.510 --> 55:06.972
Steven, as a father,
I implore you to sign this.

55:07.598 --> 55:10.809
Regardless of whether you think
Lisa is your daughter or not.

55:11.477 --> 55:13.562
There's no risk in signing.

55:14.021 --> 55:16.565
Only the regret if you don't.

55:26.742 --> 55:29.661
<i>Frederick Rodney Holt, he recently made</i>

55:29.953 --> 55:32.080
an additional preferred purchase

55:32.164 --> 55:36.919
of 106,656 shares at 19 cents a share.

55:37.419 --> 55:39.129
Right, and to be clear, this new purchase,

55:39.213 --> 55:41.089
it does not affect Mr. Holt's entitlement to

55:41.507 --> 55:42.925
founder stock.

55:43.008 --> 55:44.843
No, not at all. Steve?

55:44.927 --> 55:47.054
No, no, no. Rod gets his due.

55:47.930 --> 55:48.972
Daniel Kottke,

55:49.056 --> 55:53.185
<i>engineering technician, founding employee.
Now, at our last meeting I,</i>

55:53.852 --> 55:55.771
I don't believe that we met a consensus

55:55.854 --> 55:59.650
as to Mr. Kottke's entitlement
to founder stock.

56:00.692 --> 56:02.903
Well, in all honesty, to be rewarding Daniel

56:02.986 --> 56:05.155
with the same amount of stock as Rod seems

56:05.239 --> 56:07.407
a bit unfair. Doesn't it?

56:08.909 --> 56:11.495
Yes. Daniel gets nothing.

56:11.995 --> 56:13.080
Nothing?

56:13.622 --> 56:14.706
Don't you think you should

56:14.790 --> 56:16.833
think about what you're doing,
for a second?

56:17.125 --> 56:20.295
I have thought about it.
Daniel gets nothing.

56:21.255 --> 56:22.339
Yes, sir.

56:22.422 --> 56:23.882
It's noted.

56:24.967 --> 56:26.343
What?

56:26.718 --> 56:29.388
Any low grade technician
could do his job.

56:29.471 --> 56:32.432
I've been feeding him for years.
It's not personal.

56:32.516 --> 56:34.893
Don't give me that bullshit, Steve.
Of course it's personal.

56:34.977 --> 56:36.186
He can barely do his job.

56:36.270 --> 56:37.479
If we give Daniel preferred stock,

56:37.563 --> 56:40.399
some engineer with 10 times his talent
gets nothing.

56:40.482 --> 56:41.567
Then what happens?

56:41.650 --> 56:43.694
Then we just draw this line
right here, right now, okay?

56:43.777 --> 56:45.862
So you, what are you talking about?
Management, or...

56:45.946 --> 56:47.239
Management and engineers.

56:47.322 --> 56:48.323
Yeah, this means...

56:48.407 --> 56:50.492
I know what it means, Mike.

56:50.951 --> 56:52.160
Thanks.

56:53.537 --> 56:55.789
- No, he's...
- You know what, I don't...

56:57.207 --> 56:59.084
Okay then. Shall we continue?

57:00.127 --> 57:01.712
<i>We can assume that Bill Fernandez,</i>

57:01.795 --> 57:03.088
Randy Wiggington

57:03.171 --> 57:04.965
and Chris Espinosa will not

57:05.048 --> 57:06.425
<i>be receiving</i>

57:06.508 --> 57:08.051
any options?

57:30.741 --> 57:32.200
Drinking a beer, huh?

57:35.370 --> 57:36.788
Tomorrow's a big day for you.

57:38.040 --> 57:39.416
For us.

57:40.417 --> 57:41.710
For us.

57:43.712 --> 57:48.258
Mike told me about what happened
with Bill and Dan

57:49.635 --> 57:54.431
and Chris. And, Steve...

57:56.475 --> 57:57.684
Why'd you do it?

57:57.934 --> 58:00.187
The company outgrew them.

58:00.270 --> 58:03.106
They're not management.
They're not project leads.

58:03.815 --> 58:05.400
It's not my job to be nice to people.

58:05.484 --> 58:07.069
It's my job to make them better.

58:07.486 --> 58:08.862
They don't deserve it.

58:08.945 --> 58:10.822
Then who the hell does?

58:10.906 --> 58:12.157
Do you know how this company works?

58:12.949 --> 58:14.159
Do you want to know?

58:14.284 --> 58:16.912
I'd be happy to teach you,
if you want to know.

58:19.081 --> 58:22.250
Do you know why I started this company with you?

58:23.418 --> 58:27.506
Why I left the safety of HP for this?

58:27.589 --> 58:30.300
I doubt you do. You never asked.

58:32.427 --> 58:34.638
I left because this was my thing.

58:35.097 --> 58:37.599
And you guys thought it was cool.

58:38.266 --> 58:40.852
I just wanted to be one of the guys.

58:43.605 --> 58:48.777
And of all the guys I knew,
you were the coolest.

58:49.986 --> 58:52.447
You were smart, quick-witted.

58:53.532 --> 58:56.451
And this was my chance
to do what I loved.

58:57.953 --> 59:00.288
And to do it for fun.

59:02.207 --> 59:04.626
That's all, that's all I ever wanted.

59:05.711 --> 59:08.004
I thought that's what you wanted, too.

59:12.134 --> 59:14.636
Something's happened to you, Steve.

59:16.054 --> 59:17.723
I'm grown up, Woz.

59:19.891 --> 59:23.145
No. No, you're not.

59:50.797 --> 59:52.883
<i>And now, turning to big news in business,</i>

59:52.966 --> 59:55.802
<i>Apple Incorporated is making headlines
once again.</i>

59:55.886 --> 59:57.512
<i>On Wall Street the tech titan Apple</i>

59:57.596 --> 01:00:00.098
<i>went public this morning,
to incredible market interest,</i>

01:00:00.182 --> 01:00:03.268
<i>as four point six million shares
of its IPO</i>

01:00:03.351 --> 01:00:05.395
<i>were sold within an hour
of the opening bell.</i>

01:00:05.729 --> 01:00:07.856
<i>Wall Street executives had forecast the big day</i>

01:00:07.939 --> 01:00:09.441
<i>for the growing technology company,</i>

01:00:09.524 --> 01:00:11.443
<i>but experts now say Apple's day</i>

01:00:11.526 --> 01:00:13.361
<i>exceeded the market's wildest expectations.</i>

01:00:13.695 --> 01:00:15.030
<i>It was the most over...</i>

01:00:33.715 --> 01:00:35.467
Hey, hey. Here he is!

01:00:36.343 --> 01:00:38.720
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, terrific.

01:00:47.395 --> 01:00:49.022
Yeah, you did it.

01:00:49.397 --> 01:00:50.857
Let's help them move that stock.

01:00:51.066 --> 01:00:52.275
Hey, pal.

01:00:52.692 --> 01:00:54.236
Oh, hey, thank you.

01:00:56.738 --> 01:00:57.948
Business as usual, guys.

01:01:08.375 --> 01:01:09.876
There's work to be done, people.

01:01:10.293 --> 01:01:13.797
Thank you. I had some fun ideas.

01:01:14.756 --> 01:01:16.800
This is it for me, Bill.
I'll see you when I see you.

01:01:16.883 --> 01:01:18.301
I'm gonna get out of here.

01:01:18.385 --> 01:01:19.594
I'll call you later.

01:01:19.678 --> 01:01:20.887
All right.

01:01:40.407 --> 01:01:43.827
Hi. Could you please tell Mr. Markkula
we're here. Thank you.

01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:45.745
Yes, sir, Mr. Rock.

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:53.044
Gentlemen.

01:01:53.128 --> 01:01:54.796
Mike. Please.

01:01:56.965 --> 01:01:58.216
Have a seat.

01:02:00.343 --> 01:02:01.678
There's something we need to talk about,

01:02:01.761 --> 01:02:04.639
and I don't think you're gonna like it.

01:02:05.348 --> 01:02:06.892
It's Steve.

01:02:06.975 --> 01:02:09.185
He's hemorrhaging the company's dollar

01:02:09.311 --> 01:02:12.606
on fantasies that simply are not possible
with the Lisa computer.

01:02:13.773 --> 01:02:15.734
Yeah, but Steve's been doing the impossible

01:02:15.817 --> 01:02:17.777
ever since this company was in a garage.

01:02:18.194 --> 01:02:21.615
<i>Mike, I love everything Steve represents.
You know that.</i>

01:02:21.865 --> 01:02:25.285
<i>But he's like a kid in a candy store,
and we've given him the keys.</i>

01:02:25.668 --> 01:02:28.830
Yeah. But, it's his candy store.

01:02:29.164 --> 01:02:31.541
You're never gonna see a personal computer

01:02:31.875 --> 01:02:34.085
where the keyboard is attached
to the machine again.

01:02:34.169 --> 01:02:35.795
<i>Mike, it's a problem.</i>

01:02:35.879 --> 01:02:39.549
The bigger problem is that
he is ridiculing IBM.

01:02:39.674 --> 01:02:43.637
<i>Jobs took out a full page ad
in The Wall Street Journal</i>

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:46.973
taunting the biggest computer company
on the planet.

01:02:47.515 --> 01:02:50.393
"Congratulations on your first personal computer."

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:53.480
He's trying to start a war with IB fucking M!

01:02:53.772 --> 01:02:55.231
I'm fully aware of the ad.

01:02:55.315 --> 01:02:56.650
Then do something about it!

01:02:56.733 --> 01:02:59.027
Listen, Arthur, you know he's right.

01:02:59.152 --> 01:03:02.238
Three years ago IBM had no interest
in the personal computer

01:03:02.322 --> 01:03:03.615
and now look at 'em!

01:03:03.698 --> 01:03:05.992
They followed us. Think about it.

01:03:06.159 --> 01:03:07.369
We have, Mike.

01:03:07.744 --> 01:03:09.996
And I'm sorry, but the Board is unanimous.

01:03:10.538 --> 01:03:13.208
Steve will no longer be involved
in Lisa's development. Period.

01:03:14.042 --> 01:03:17.712
<i>What is this, Arthur?
Some sort of power play?</i>

01:03:18.213 --> 01:03:20.256
<i>For 18 months now
you've offered nothing but support.</i>

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:23.760
And now you want to try
and take Jobs off of his own team?

01:03:26.554 --> 01:03:29.015
I don't want any of this, Mike.

01:03:29.599 --> 01:03:30.809
But you have to try to look at it

01:03:30.892 --> 01:03:32.811
from the shareholder's perspective.

01:03:32.894 --> 01:03:34.229
Steve is great.

01:03:34.771 --> 01:03:36.856
- He's great.
- Yeah, he's great.

01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:38.400
But he's a time bomb.

01:03:39.234 --> 01:03:41.361
And it's our job to diffuse him.

01:03:42.737 --> 01:03:44.030
So take care of it.

01:03:47.242 --> 01:03:49.452
I don't give a shit what the Board thinks.

01:03:49.577 --> 01:03:52.956
It's the time you're taking. Your perfectionism.
It's, it's, it...

01:03:53.081 --> 01:03:54.666
They're looking at losses in the millions

01:03:54.749 --> 01:03:56.292
before this thing even gets off the ground.

01:03:58.545 --> 01:04:01.464
They're not seeing the big picture.

01:04:01.548 --> 01:04:04.092
That's right. The shareholders
don't see past their own shadows.

01:04:04.175 --> 01:04:05.969
They're only concerned
about the here and the now.

01:04:06.052 --> 01:04:07.804
And the Board has got blinders on.

01:04:07.929 --> 01:04:08.972
If they could see you they'd take them off,

01:04:09.097 --> 01:04:10.306
they'd see you the way I see you.

01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:11.516
The way your employees see you.

01:04:11.599 --> 01:04:13.601
Lisa is my project.

01:04:14.561 --> 01:04:15.562
It's mine.

01:04:16.146 --> 01:04:18.815
And they're taking it away from me?

01:04:22.402 --> 01:04:24.195
You're letting them take it away from me.

01:04:24.779 --> 01:04:26.698
Bullshit, Steve.
You know that's not true.

01:04:29.951 --> 01:04:31.286
Shit.

01:04:43.381 --> 01:04:45.175
<i>in more schools than any other computer...</i>

01:04:47.093 --> 01:04:50.305
<i>Everything from alphabet lessons for preschool,</i>

01:04:50.388 --> 01:04:53.141
<i>to science programs for graduate school.</i>

01:04:53.808 --> 01:04:55.810
<i>So whatever Brian wants to be,</i>

01:04:56.269 --> 01:04:57.562
<i>an Apple personal computer</i>

01:04:58.605 --> 01:05:00.398
<i>can help him be it.</i>

01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:03.902
<i>The Apple II. There's no telling
how far it can take you.</i>

01:05:21.753 --> 01:05:23.171
<i>Now that doesn't make any sense.</i>

01:05:23.254 --> 01:05:26.758
<i>Well, you haven't seen
as much of murder as I have, Mr. Cross.</i>

01:05:26.841 --> 01:05:30.303
<i>I'd rather have a judge give me the works
than have to do it myself.</i>

01:05:30.678 --> 01:05:31.930
<i>Right here in solitary.</i>

01:05:32.013 --> 01:05:33.098
<i>So what?</i>

01:05:33.181 --> 01:05:36.768
<i>So you go right on punishing yourself.
You can't get away with it.</i>

01:05:41.314 --> 01:05:42.607
<i>Hi, I'm Gabe Kaplan.</i>

01:05:42.816 --> 01:05:45.276
<i>Take the Pepsi Challenge.
Let your taste decide.</i>

01:05:45.443 --> 01:05:47.946
<i>Right, guys?
Okay, now why don't you tell me</i>

01:05:48.029 --> 01:05:50.532
<i>which one you chose. Pepsi Cola.</i>

01:05:51.282 --> 01:05:53.034
<i>- Yeah?
- Hey, Steve. It's Mike.</i>

01:05:53.368 --> 01:05:54.452
Hey.

01:05:54.536 --> 01:05:57.539
<i>Hey. I think I may have found
a project for you.</i>

01:05:57.705 --> 01:05:59.624
<i>It's more of an R&D outcast than anything,</i>

01:05:59.707 --> 01:06:02.001
<i>but it's actually a project
you approved some time back.</i>

01:06:02.085 --> 01:06:03.878
<i>Why don't you look into it?</i>

01:06:10.218 --> 01:06:12.011
So this is the Macintosh team.

01:06:13.555 --> 01:06:15.098
Oh, Jesus.

01:06:15.181 --> 01:06:17.058
Nope. It's just Steve.

01:06:17.559 --> 01:06:19.435
It's really good to see you, Steve.

01:06:20.228 --> 01:06:23.648
Bill Atkinson. It's good to see
they got A players over here.

01:06:24.131 --> 01:06:25.567
Hey. Get up.

01:06:30.613 --> 01:06:32.198
Hi, Steve Jobs.

01:06:32.282 --> 01:06:33.324
What's your name?

01:06:33.408 --> 01:06:34.993
Burr... Burrell Smith.

01:06:35.076 --> 01:06:36.327
Burrell Smith.

01:06:36.995 --> 01:06:38.037
Oh, sorry for the mess.

01:06:38.121 --> 01:06:40.665
We're just a bunch of degenerates. So...

01:06:40.832 --> 01:06:42.250
It's okay. I like degenerates.

01:06:42.333 --> 01:06:43.376
Yeah.

01:06:44.294 --> 01:06:45.336
Who's your project lead?

01:06:45.628 --> 01:06:47.046
Uh, Jef Raskin...

01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:50.550
I don't know where he is.

01:06:50.633 --> 01:06:52.135
Jef Raskin.

01:06:53.469 --> 01:06:57.432
Okay. I'll deal with that one.
I'll be taking over now.

01:06:59.516 --> 01:07:03.479
Sorry, taking over, like,
the entire Macintosh project?

01:07:04.230 --> 01:07:05.982
- Yeah.
- Awesome.

01:07:07.859 --> 01:07:09.819
Where's your design team?

01:07:12.614 --> 01:07:14.032
Team? I don't...

01:07:15.408 --> 01:07:16.826
Show me your current build.

01:07:19.787 --> 01:07:22.373
Well, obviously ease of use
is a big feature here.

01:07:22.457 --> 01:07:24.083
We're trying to develop a simpler interface

01:07:24.167 --> 01:07:27.045
that's geared towards
the real layman end user.

01:07:28.296 --> 01:07:31.591
But, we're kind of struggling with the interface,
and, to be frank...

01:07:31.674 --> 01:07:33.259
The results have been...

01:07:33.676 --> 01:07:35.053
- Shit.
- Yeah.

01:07:35.136 --> 01:07:36.137
What's it got under the hood?

01:07:37.347 --> 01:07:38.598
Standard kick ass stuff.

01:07:38.681 --> 01:07:39.891
Sixty-four K RAM...

01:07:39.974 --> 01:07:42.852
Two fifty-six bitmap display, Motorola 6809.

01:07:43.603 --> 01:07:45.396
We're gonna run the 68000.

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:47.899
But dude, that's Lisa's processor.

01:07:47.982 --> 01:07:50.318
That's correct. Dude.

01:07:51.236 --> 01:07:53.488
I don't care what the budget is.
Give me their processor.

01:07:54.822 --> 01:07:56.115
Done.

01:07:56.324 --> 01:07:57.909
Hey, Steve.

01:07:58.201 --> 01:07:59.369
How are you, man?

01:08:02.121 --> 01:08:03.206
Chris, it has been a...

01:08:03.289 --> 01:08:04.290
Yep.

01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:06.668
- You're working on the Macintosh?
- Yeah.

01:08:07.710 --> 01:08:08.962
Good.

01:08:09.754 --> 01:08:11.506
Good, this is gonna be fun.

01:08:18.554 --> 01:08:21.099
Okay. Let's go back to what
you were saying before.

01:08:21.182 --> 01:08:24.102
This thing is for the everyman. Right?

01:08:24.435 --> 01:08:25.853
That's our end user.

01:08:27.313 --> 01:08:29.107
It's the school teacher.

01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:30.566
It's the garbage man.

01:08:30.649 --> 01:08:35.071
It's the kid.
It's some grandma out in Nebraska. Right?

01:08:35.571 --> 01:08:38.992
So we need to make this thing simple.

01:08:39.783 --> 01:08:42.370
It's gotta work like...

01:08:43.871 --> 01:08:45.540
like an appliance.

01:08:48.167 --> 01:08:49.460
Hey, Jef.

01:08:49.544 --> 01:08:50.795
Steve Jobs is here.

01:08:51.796 --> 01:08:54.090
Since you weren't around...

01:08:55.008 --> 01:08:58.970
Some of the project leads
were having a meeting with Motorola.

01:08:59.970 --> 01:09:01.264
Why exactly are you here?

01:09:02.348 --> 01:09:05.393
I'm here to help build the Macintosh.

01:09:06.018 --> 01:09:09.063
I'm not sure that that's practical for us.

01:09:09.147 --> 01:09:12.066
We're actually trying to avoid this project

01:09:12.149 --> 01:09:14.902
becoming another over bloated disaster.

01:09:20.116 --> 01:09:21.743
Okay, Jef.

01:09:25.412 --> 01:09:26.956
You got my attention.

01:09:29.709 --> 01:09:30.917
Look, Steve.

01:09:32.252 --> 01:09:34.756
You didn't want to be involved
back when we started this thing,

01:09:34.839 --> 01:09:37.050
and that was fine by me.

01:09:37.341 --> 01:09:39.676
I just wanted you to cut the checks.

01:09:39.761 --> 01:09:42.346
Be involved, just don't turn Macintosh

01:09:42.430 --> 01:09:44.932
into a measure of revenge for you.

01:09:45.558 --> 01:09:48.728
Everyone knows about your fallout
with Team Lisa.

01:09:48.810 --> 01:09:53.149
So trust me when I say,
we're doing fine.

01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:57.153
Okay, Jef.

01:09:59.947 --> 01:10:01.366
Let's get a couple things straight.

01:10:04.035 --> 01:10:06.662
We don't do fine.

01:10:07.538 --> 01:10:09.999
And we don't accept things
the way that they are,

01:10:10.083 --> 01:10:13.378
and we don't stop innovating.

01:10:14.712 --> 01:10:17.048
Now, your machine lacks power.

01:10:17.298 --> 01:10:19.801
And your little interface, it needs work.

01:10:19.884 --> 01:10:21.260
And I'm here to help with that.

01:10:21.844 --> 01:10:25.515
Now, I'm not trying to take Macintosh
away from you.

01:10:25.807 --> 01:10:28.684
I want you on this team.

01:10:28.976 --> 01:10:32.980
But you can either get on board,
or you can get the fuck out.

01:10:41.155 --> 01:10:44.450
Okay. Now, we've got a lot of work to do.
So, let's get to it.

01:10:44.534 --> 01:10:45.993
Bill, you come with me.

01:10:46.077 --> 01:10:47.745
Okay. Where are we going?

01:10:47.829 --> 01:10:48.871
Recruiting.

01:10:49.956 --> 01:10:51.124
Shit.

01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:55.628
- Hey, Steve.
- Hold these for a second.

01:10:55.711 --> 01:10:57.171
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

01:10:57.255 --> 01:10:59.549
What, what's going on?
What are you doing?

01:11:00.591 --> 01:11:02.301
- Steve?
- You're on the Macintosh Team now.

01:11:02.385 --> 01:11:06.264
What, Ste... What's a Macintosh?

01:11:09.058 --> 01:11:10.476
Andy Hertzfeld.

01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:11.936
Are you good?

01:11:12.019 --> 01:11:14.689
I only want good people working on Macintosh,

01:11:15.148 --> 01:11:16.899
and I'm not sure if you're good enough.

01:11:18.109 --> 01:11:19.110
Excuse me?

01:11:19.193 --> 01:11:21.571
Bill Atkinson says that you're good.

01:11:22.029 --> 01:11:24.532
I... Yes. I think I'm pretty good.

01:11:24.657 --> 01:11:25.658
Are you creative?

01:11:25.741 --> 01:11:26.868
I... I... I think so.

01:11:26.951 --> 01:11:29.412
Welcome to the Macintosh Team.

01:11:37.170 --> 01:11:38.629
I'm tired of saving your ass, kid.

01:11:38.713 --> 01:11:40.047
You love saving my ass.

01:11:40.131 --> 01:11:41.841
I want my own engineering team.

01:11:41.924 --> 01:11:43.634
You can pick them yourself.

01:11:44.093 --> 01:11:47.305
And I am done working under the gun

01:11:47.388 --> 01:11:50.558
of your ridiculous deadline bullshit.

01:11:50.725 --> 01:11:53.227
You might as well be asking
for a date with her.

01:11:53.561 --> 01:11:55.038
I want that, too.

01:11:55.521 --> 01:11:56.814
Done.

01:11:56.898 --> 01:11:58.399
Serious, Steve.

01:12:00.651 --> 01:12:03.237
So what is this, Steve?
Some sort of performance review?

01:12:03.321 --> 01:12:04.405
How are things going on the IIE?

01:12:04.906 --> 01:12:07.325
Things are great. Really great.

01:12:07.408 --> 01:12:08.659
You're bored to death, aren't you?

01:12:08.743 --> 01:12:10.161
Yes. Yes I am.

01:12:13.247 --> 01:12:14.582
You want to come work with me
on the Mac Team?

01:12:14.665 --> 01:12:17.418
You're trying to recruit me
for the Mac Team, aren't you?

01:12:17.502 --> 01:12:19.003
Okay, I'm in.

01:12:24.634 --> 01:12:27.512
You've gotta have a problem
that you want to solve.

01:12:27.595 --> 01:12:29.263
A wrong that you want to right.

01:12:29.388 --> 01:12:31.557
And it's gotta be something
that you're passionate about,

01:12:31.641 --> 01:12:34.602
because otherwise you won't have
the perseverance to see it through.

01:12:34.769 --> 01:12:38.022
I don't ever want to hear you tell me
that you can't make it faster.

01:12:38.105 --> 01:12:40.733
I mean, millions of people
are gonna buy this machine.

01:12:40.816 --> 01:12:42.944
And we can't look at the competition

01:12:43.027 --> 01:12:45.029
and say we're gonna do it better.

01:12:45.112 --> 01:12:48.741
We have to look at the competition
and say we're gonna do it differently.

01:12:49.116 --> 01:12:53.621
We have an opportunity to build
a revolutionary machine.

01:12:53.913 --> 01:12:56.624
<i>And in your life you only get to do
so many things.</i>

01:12:56.791 --> 01:13:00.253
<i>Right now we've chosen to do this.</i>

01:13:00.461 --> 01:13:02.505
<i>So let's make it great.</i>

01:13:30.324 --> 01:13:31.492
It's great.

01:13:34.704 --> 01:13:36.622
No. It's not.

01:13:37.873 --> 01:13:39.667
It's insanely great.

01:13:47.508 --> 01:13:49.552
We should try to get more memory into it
if we can.

01:13:51.053 --> 01:13:52.430
We can still hit the timeline.

01:13:53.973 --> 01:13:55.224
Take a look at it.

01:13:56.350 --> 01:13:59.145
This little Macintosh side project
has gotten out of hand, Steve.

01:13:59.228 --> 01:14:00.730
Way beyond the pale.

01:14:01.439 --> 01:14:04.900
First you created a $10,000 monstrosity with Lisa,

01:14:04.984 --> 01:14:06.819
and now you've poured millions

01:14:06.902 --> 01:14:08.696
into what was supposed
to be a minor diversion.

01:14:09.447 --> 01:14:11.282
You've missed multiple ship dates,

01:14:11.699 --> 01:14:14.577
and meanwhile, IBM is just purring along.

01:14:15.077 --> 01:14:16.329
Steve...

01:14:16.412 --> 01:14:19.081
People don't use computers
the way you think they do.

01:14:19.498 --> 01:14:22.168
How are we even supposed
to market the Macintosh?

01:14:22.543 --> 01:14:23.794
We don't.

01:14:25.296 --> 01:14:28.382
You give me five candidates for CEO.
You're gonna let me choose.

01:14:28.466 --> 01:14:30.343
I say we choose someone
with a marketing background

01:14:30.426 --> 01:14:32.136
to help us sell what's never been sold.

01:14:32.511 --> 01:14:35.848
Now, while I would like
to run my own company,

01:14:35.931 --> 01:14:40.394
Mike has helped me understand
that you don't think I'm ready.

01:14:41.103 --> 01:14:42.647
Yes, because you're not.

01:14:42.730 --> 01:14:43.773
Okay.

01:14:44.273 --> 01:14:45.650
I want John Sculley.

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:47.568
John Sculley?

01:14:47.652 --> 01:14:49.195
President of Pepsi Cola.

01:14:49.278 --> 01:14:50.404
The Pepsi Challenge guy.

01:14:50.613 --> 01:14:53.407
He's smart, he's a marketing genius

01:14:53.908 --> 01:14:55.576
and he'll do whatever it takes to succeed.

01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:57.370
Steve, Sculley is a tough get.

01:14:57.828 --> 01:14:59.205
Maybe the toughest on our list.

01:14:59.747 --> 01:15:02.124
What the hell makes you think
you can get him?

01:15:03.751 --> 01:15:05.419
Why would he ever leave Pepsi?

01:15:08.297 --> 01:15:11.592
Nobody remembers the world's
best soda salesman.

01:15:28.609 --> 01:15:30.277
I need somebody I can trust.

01:15:33.531 --> 01:15:35.783
<i>You can make a great product.</i>

01:15:37.076 --> 01:15:38.494
But you have to convince people

01:15:38.577 --> 01:15:41.205
that what you're selling is greater.

01:15:41.664 --> 01:15:45.334
We're not selling computers.
We're selling what they can do

01:15:46.001 --> 01:15:47.628
with a computer.

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:50.005
A tool for the mind.

01:15:51.632 --> 01:15:54.301
And that, ladies and gentlemen,

01:15:55.010 --> 01:15:56.762
is limitless.

01:15:57.430 --> 01:15:59.390
Because people will never stop believing

01:15:59.473 --> 01:16:01.434
that they could get more out of something,

01:16:02.143 --> 01:16:05.980
whether it be their jobs,
their marriage, their money,

01:16:06.147 --> 01:16:07.940
their lives.

01:16:08.023 --> 01:16:10.276
That's what you have to do with the Mac.

01:16:10.818 --> 01:16:12.987
It's the belief in the limitless.

01:16:13.946 --> 01:16:15.656
The impossible.

01:16:15.865 --> 01:16:19.493
That no matter what you dream,
you can do it.

01:16:20.369 --> 01:16:22.204
And Mac will help you get there.

01:16:23.414 --> 01:16:26.375
A few months ago, when Steve
was visiting me in Manhattan,

01:16:26.459 --> 01:16:29.545
he asked me a very important question.
He said,

01:16:31.005 --> 01:16:33.257
"Do you want to sell sugar water
for the rest of your life,

01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:37.428
"or come with me, and change the world?"

01:16:41.182 --> 01:16:42.516
Well,

01:16:43.476 --> 01:16:46.228
here I am. Thank you.

01:17:09.710 --> 01:17:12.880
<i>It is now 1984.</i>

01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:17.301
<i>It appears IBM wants it all.</i>

01:17:18.010 --> 01:17:20.596
<i>Apple is perceived to be the only hope</i>

01:17:20.679 --> 01:17:23.224
<i>to offer IBM a run for its money.</i>

01:17:23.724 --> 01:17:28.020
<i>Will Big Blue dominate
the entire computer industry?</i>

01:17:28.354 --> 01:17:29.396
No!

01:17:30.064 --> 01:17:32.399
<i>The entire information age?</i>

01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:33.901
No!

01:17:34.652 --> 01:17:39.240
<i>Was George Orwell right about 1984?</i>

01:17:39.990 --> 01:17:41.059
No!

01:17:42.034 --> 01:17:43.661
<i>Today we celebrate the first</i>

01:17:44.245 --> 01:17:48.249
<i>glorious anniversary of the
Information Purification Directives.</i>

01:17:50.835 --> 01:17:52.253
<i>For the first time in all history,</i>

01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:55.923
<i>a garden of pure ideology,</i>

01:17:56.257 --> 01:17:58.425
<i>where each worker may bloom,</i>

01:17:58.509 --> 01:18:00.427
<i>secure from the pests.</i>

01:18:00.594 --> 01:18:02.930
<i>Our enemies shall talk themselves to death.</i>

01:18:09.103 --> 01:18:10.938
<i>First time in all history.</i>

01:18:12.439 --> 01:18:13.774
<i>We shall...</i>

01:18:14.441 --> 01:18:15.734
<i>prevail.</i>

01:18:17.069 --> 01:18:21.365
<i>On January 24th, Apple Computer
will introduce Macintosh</i>

01:18:21.615 --> 01:18:26.745
<i>and you'll see why 1984
won't be like 1984.</i>

01:18:59.403 --> 01:19:00.696
Good work.

01:19:07.995 --> 01:19:09.580
Some response, huh?
I can't believe it.

01:19:09.663 --> 01:19:10.873
It's a revolution. It's a revolution.

01:19:10.998 --> 01:19:12.249
The thing's a game changer.

01:19:12.333 --> 01:19:14.209
You really outdid yourself, Steve.

01:19:14.293 --> 01:19:17.338
Hey. Why don't you give me a call?

01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:20.132
- Grab some dinner or something.
- Yeah.

01:19:20.215 --> 01:19:22.176
- Okay.
- I'd like that.

01:19:22.885 --> 01:19:24.219
- Steve.
- Arthur.

01:19:24.345 --> 01:19:25.429
Great job up there.

01:19:25.512 --> 01:19:26.680
Thank you.

01:19:27.765 --> 01:19:30.935
Steve, I want you to know
that we believe in you.

01:19:32.394 --> 01:19:33.854
I hope you know that.

01:19:35.230 --> 01:19:37.024
Thank you, Arthur.

01:19:47.409 --> 01:19:48.619
Hey.

01:19:49.203 --> 01:19:50.204
What was that?

01:19:50.829 --> 01:19:51.914
What...

01:19:51.997 --> 01:19:53.082
Rock. He just...

01:19:54.208 --> 01:19:55.709
Said something, "we believe in you."

01:19:56.543 --> 01:19:58.379
What's going on?

01:19:58.712 --> 01:19:59.964
It's the Macintosh.

01:20:00.047 --> 01:20:01.548
You know, we had them run the numbers

01:20:01.632 --> 01:20:03.050
100 different ways, 100 times over...

01:20:03.175 --> 01:20:04.969
- You're marking up the Macintosh.
- Yep.

01:20:05.052 --> 01:20:08.055
If we keep it as is,
we'll be hemorrhaging money by launch date.

01:20:11.767 --> 01:20:13.727
You're gonna price out the consumer.

01:20:14.061 --> 01:20:15.646
Well, we can't take the risk
of flattening our profits.

01:20:15.729 --> 01:20:16.814
No.

01:20:16.897 --> 01:20:18.357
We can't have it both ways.

01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:20.985
I mean, you insisted on the most expensive hardware.

01:20:21.068 --> 01:20:22.653
The Mac was originally much cheaper.

01:20:22.736 --> 01:20:25.656
Jef Raskin designed a $1,000 box.

01:20:25.739 --> 01:20:27.032
I made it great.

01:20:27.116 --> 01:20:28.993
If you want the company
to remain profitable...

01:20:29.076 --> 01:20:30.577
Whose idea was this?

01:20:35.916 --> 01:20:37.292
It's a group decision.

01:20:38.585 --> 01:20:40.462
Whose idea was this?

01:20:43.132 --> 01:20:47.511
It was mine.
Not Michael's, not the Board. It was me.

01:20:50.305 --> 01:20:54.393
We don't do this, John.
IBM does this shit.

01:20:54.476 --> 01:20:56.395
- Steve...
- Not Apple. Not me.

01:20:56.478 --> 01:20:58.147
Look, don't make me the villain because

01:20:58.230 --> 01:21:00.566
I'm looking out for our
company's best interests.

01:21:00.649 --> 01:21:01.900
Steve.

01:21:04.278 --> 01:21:06.196
Some things have to change.

01:21:09.533 --> 01:21:12.077
If you keep heading down this path,

01:21:12.745 --> 01:21:14.621
I will not be able to protect you.

01:21:16.915 --> 01:21:18.625
They got to you.

01:21:25.299 --> 01:21:26.425
They?

01:21:52.868 --> 01:21:54.244
How'd you get this?

01:21:54.828 --> 01:21:59.416
Arrived yesterday.
It's pre-beta, obviously, but it's all...

01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:01.376
It's a blatant rip-off.

01:22:11.053 --> 01:22:13.472
Get me Bill Gates on the phone.

01:22:13.931 --> 01:22:17.935
Let me make this perfectly clear, Bill.

01:22:18.477 --> 01:22:23.440
So that when I'm finished,
you can still see through those

01:22:23.524 --> 01:22:28.195
thick pretentious glasses, you psychopathic,
unimaginative criminal.

01:22:31.281 --> 01:22:37.788
You stole my software,
and I can prove it in court.

01:22:38.705 --> 01:22:43.544
And I'm gonna sue you for every cent
that you have ever made.

01:22:43.961 --> 01:22:48.132
And I will make it my life's mission
to see to it that you never,

01:22:48.590 --> 01:22:49.675
never,

01:22:49.758 --> 01:22:53.720
ever make another dollar that
I don't first take 90 cents.

01:22:56.932 --> 01:23:00.352
I can only assume that you
are all as irate as I am,

01:23:00.435 --> 01:23:03.605
and you're simply too dumbfounded to speak.

01:23:03.897 --> 01:23:06.400
Mr. Jobs promised us a million units.

01:23:06.567 --> 01:23:08.235
We have yet to reach a quarter of that.

01:23:08.485 --> 01:23:10.112
Something has to change.

01:23:10.404 --> 01:23:13.532
With two failed projects, overextended R&Ds,

01:23:13.615 --> 01:23:14.992
and that Microsoft fiasco,

01:23:15.284 --> 01:23:18.453
we're about to experience the first
quarterly loss in company history.

01:23:18.787 --> 01:23:20.747
IBM beat us to market by two years

01:23:20.831 --> 01:23:23.125
with a better product and better sales.

01:23:23.250 --> 01:23:26.253
The Macintosh is not even a toy.
It's a joke.

01:23:26.753 --> 01:23:29.256
IBM has now moved on to mini decks.

01:23:29.965 --> 01:23:31.425
And so should we.

01:23:33.260 --> 01:23:35.470
What are you getting at, Arthur?

01:23:36.305 --> 01:23:39.057
Gentlemen, I believe it's time to reconsider

01:23:39.141 --> 01:23:41.852
the viability of the personal computer.

01:23:45.814 --> 01:23:47.774
Steve, anything to say?

01:23:51.820 --> 01:23:53.530
What would you have me say, Arthur?

01:23:55.115 --> 01:23:56.450
You raised our price.

01:23:57.576 --> 01:23:58.952
Don't put that on me.

01:23:59.036 --> 01:24:02.748
The problem is not the price, Steve.
It's your product.

01:24:03.123 --> 01:24:04.541
You over-hyped the Mac.

01:24:04.708 --> 01:24:08.670
You told people to wait.
You sold the future of the Macintosh.

01:24:09.338 --> 01:24:11.506
And as a result we lost two years of sales.

01:24:11.590 --> 01:24:12.925
It's not my fault.

01:24:13.008 --> 01:24:14.968
Well, it sure as shit is somebody's fault.

01:24:15.135 --> 01:24:16.803
Well, I'm not receiving any support.

01:24:17.846 --> 01:24:19.723
You're stripping me of my resources,

01:24:19.806 --> 01:24:21.475
and dumping millions into the Apple II.

01:24:21.558 --> 01:24:24.269
Do you know why we keep dumping millions
into the Apple II?

01:24:24.353 --> 01:24:29.316
Because it sells. It's 70% of our revenue.
How's the Mac doing?

01:24:29.399 --> 01:24:32.110
I made my opinion perfectly clear.

01:24:32.194 --> 01:24:35.822
If you want to keep sucking on the tailpipe of IBM,
then I can't stop you.

01:24:36.031 --> 01:24:39.785
But I will not take the blame
for the failures of some court jester.

01:24:40.535 --> 01:24:41.745
All right, this is crazy, Steve...

01:24:41.828 --> 01:24:44.665
No. No, no.
To whom are you referring, Steve?

01:24:45.332 --> 01:24:46.917
I don't know, Arthur.

01:24:47.042 --> 01:24:48.585
You tell me.

01:24:53.674 --> 01:24:55.842
John, you're awfully quiet.

01:24:58.929 --> 01:25:00.472
Yeah. I'm sorry.

01:25:02.599 --> 01:25:04.518
I guess I'm just at a loss for words.

01:25:05.727 --> 01:25:08.897
Head of marketing. Pepsi genius.

01:25:09.231 --> 01:25:10.857
Loss for words.

01:25:11.608 --> 01:25:14.861
It's him. Not the Mac.

01:25:18.031 --> 01:25:19.658
But the cost of that process...

01:25:26.081 --> 01:25:30.419
$10,000 price tag. That price tag...

01:25:38.176 --> 01:25:40.220
Goes against him, and not against Mac.

01:25:40.971 --> 01:25:42.764
It's ironic, isn't it?

01:25:44.975 --> 01:25:48.562
You chose Dylan, I chose,
I chose The Beatles.

01:25:48.645 --> 01:25:50.522
Seems so backward now.

01:25:50.605 --> 01:25:51.732
Woz.

01:25:52.482 --> 01:25:54.151
What are you doing here?

01:25:55.777 --> 01:25:57.487
Good to see you, too, Steve.

01:25:57.571 --> 01:26:00.073
I'm... I'm a little bit busy.

01:26:00.741 --> 01:26:02.826
Just, do you mind if we talk later?

01:26:02.909 --> 01:26:05.954
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
This'll only take a minute.

01:26:07.706 --> 01:26:08.915
I, uh...

01:26:09.624 --> 01:26:11.460
I'm leaving, Steve.

01:26:12.753 --> 01:26:13.962
Okay.

01:26:15.088 --> 01:26:16.923
No. No, Steve.

01:26:18.759 --> 01:26:20.218
I'm leaving Apple.

01:26:22.054 --> 01:26:25.057
For good. Actually, I already did. I just...

01:26:25.766 --> 01:26:28.685
I thought I should come back
and tell you first.

01:26:29.561 --> 01:26:30.854
Why?

01:26:34.858 --> 01:26:38.612
We both knew this was coming for some time.
I don't even...

01:26:38.695 --> 01:26:41.198
I don't even remember
the last time we talked.

01:26:43.533 --> 01:26:45.035
What do you want from me, then?

01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:49.289
Not everyone has an agenda, Steve.

01:26:51.291 --> 01:26:52.584
Right.

01:26:56.004 --> 01:26:59.466
You know, I can still remember
when we were just kids,

01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:02.094
back in your dad's garage.

01:27:04.304 --> 01:27:05.555
And we just wanted to

01:27:05.639 --> 01:27:09.267
create cool toys for people like us.
You remember that?

01:27:10.644 --> 01:27:11.853
Yeah.

01:27:12.270 --> 01:27:15.315
Now it's not about people anymore for you.

01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:17.692
No, it's about the product.

01:27:19.111 --> 01:27:20.987
Worst of all, it's...

01:27:22.739 --> 01:27:23.990
It's about yourself.

01:27:25.617 --> 01:27:29.246
You're the beginning and end
of your own world, Steve.

01:27:31.164 --> 01:27:35.585
And it's so small. So sad.

01:27:37.963 --> 01:27:41.383
And it's... it's gotta be lonely.

01:27:43.176 --> 01:27:45.512
And I know you're gonna say

01:27:46.179 --> 01:27:48.515
that the product and the person

01:27:48.598 --> 01:27:50.851
need to be connected and all that,

01:27:50.934 --> 01:27:54.813
but it will never be
what you think it will.

01:27:56.231 --> 01:27:58.024
It just won't.

01:27:59.025 --> 01:28:01.820
No, not, not for a long time at least.

01:28:03.321 --> 01:28:07.075
I don't know what you think
is going on, Steve, but I do.

01:28:07.576 --> 01:28:09.995
And it doesn't end well for you.

01:28:12.581 --> 01:28:14.583
And I'm not...

01:28:15.917 --> 01:28:18.503
I'm not sticking around to watch.

01:28:22.299 --> 01:28:24.301
It's been a journey.

01:28:28.472 --> 01:28:30.724
And for the record,

01:28:34.769 --> 01:28:36.521
I love what we did.

01:29:32.369 --> 01:29:35.705
<i>Hi. You've reached John Sculley.
Please leave a message.</i>

01:29:36.456 --> 01:29:39.125
Hey, John. It's Steve.

01:29:41.127 --> 01:29:42.587
I just...

01:29:47.217 --> 01:29:50.095
We're still partners, John, you and I.

01:29:50.804 --> 01:29:52.973
We are, we're in this together.

01:29:53.139 --> 01:29:54.299
And I...

01:29:58.478 --> 01:30:00.398
You just give me a call back?
That'd be great.

01:30:13.285 --> 01:30:15.287
Hey, Mike. It's Steve.

01:30:17.998 --> 01:30:20.375
Would you give me a call back?

01:30:22.168 --> 01:30:23.503
Please?

01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:34.055
John, you have to take control now.

01:30:34.180 --> 01:30:36.975
Do you have any idea how close
our shareholders are to a panic?

01:30:37.058 --> 01:30:39.519
The implications of your inaction?

01:30:40.562 --> 01:30:43.857
Forget your job,
the entire company is at stake here.

01:30:43.982 --> 01:30:45.400
This could ruin everyone.

01:30:45.650 --> 01:30:47.986
I know, Arthur, but I still think
that we can salvage this.

01:30:48.069 --> 01:30:50.196
Can't salvage anything.

01:30:50.697 --> 01:30:51.906
I doubt...

01:30:51.990 --> 01:30:53.283
Steve.

01:30:54.868 --> 01:30:55.869
Mike.

01:30:56.411 --> 01:30:57.621
John.

01:30:57.704 --> 01:30:58.705
Steve.

01:30:58.872 --> 01:31:00.373
Arthur.

01:31:00.874 --> 01:31:02.626
What the hell are you doing here so early?

01:31:03.335 --> 01:31:05.587
I could ask you the same question.

01:31:07.005 --> 01:31:08.673
This is good.

01:31:08.757 --> 01:31:12.177
Steve, why don't you join us this time?
Have a seat.

01:31:12.385 --> 01:31:13.595
This time?

01:31:13.678 --> 01:31:15.889
Steve, have a seat.

01:31:24.564 --> 01:31:25.732
John?

01:31:27.609 --> 01:31:29.110
- Arthur, I don't want to.
- Yes.

01:31:29.444 --> 01:31:32.405
You do. Say it.

01:31:44.709 --> 01:31:46.836
Tell him what you've told me.

01:31:51.341 --> 01:31:54.928
I find it increasingly difficult
to do my job

01:31:56.930 --> 01:31:59.933
when the greatest obstacle in my path

01:32:01.559 --> 01:32:04.270
casts a looming shadow
over everything I try to do.

01:32:11.945 --> 01:32:13.113
What did you say?

01:32:14.656 --> 01:32:16.157
Steve...

01:32:18.410 --> 01:32:20.537
You are your own worst enemy.

01:32:23.331 --> 01:32:25.792
And this company's.

01:32:32.590 --> 01:32:34.968
This... It's unbelievable.

01:32:36.302 --> 01:32:38.388
Who do you think you are?

01:32:43.643 --> 01:32:46.479
I'm CEO of Apple Computer.

01:32:52.902 --> 01:32:54.279
Hiring you

01:32:54.904 --> 01:32:59.492
was the worst mistake
I have ever made.

01:33:03.455 --> 01:33:05.373
Steve, it doesn't have to be this way.

01:33:10.962 --> 01:33:12.505
Okay. That's done.

01:33:13.339 --> 01:33:15.425
<i>Boards don't run companies.</i>

01:33:15.592 --> 01:33:18.928
The people who create the product
run the company.

01:33:19.012 --> 01:33:21.431
He has the nerve to tell me
we should have used the 512.

01:33:21.514 --> 01:33:22.766
We told them that it needed a 512.

01:33:22.849 --> 01:33:24.768
We said not to use the 128.

01:33:24.851 --> 01:33:28.104
We knew 128 kilobytes wasn't gonna get it done
when we built it.

01:33:28.188 --> 01:33:30.440
Sculley is leaving for China tonight.

01:33:30.523 --> 01:33:32.776
He's gonna be there for a week,
so we got time.

01:33:32.859 --> 01:33:34.152
We just gotta recruit.

01:33:34.235 --> 01:33:35.779
Steve, Sculley's gonna find out.

01:33:35.862 --> 01:33:38.114
And then what happens, you know?

01:33:38.198 --> 01:33:39.616
He's the CEO of the company now.

01:33:39.699 --> 01:33:40.825
Well, for now.

01:33:40.909 --> 01:33:43.453
But we have the people who make Apple.

01:33:44.621 --> 01:33:45.705
Oh, hey, Mike.

01:33:45.997 --> 01:33:47.999
We're just getting started.

01:33:51.377 --> 01:33:53.463
Guys, give us a second.

01:33:59.385 --> 01:34:00.678
John's canceled his trip.

01:34:02.472 --> 01:34:06.226
He's having an executive staff meeting
first thing tomorrow.

01:34:09.729 --> 01:34:12.899
So I didn't come to join your revolution.
I came to warn you.

01:34:14.484 --> 01:34:16.152
He wants to make absolutely sure

01:34:16.236 --> 01:34:18.071
you're nothing more than a figurehead.

01:34:19.531 --> 01:34:21.115
No power, no title.

01:34:21.658 --> 01:34:22.867
No team.

01:34:29.749 --> 01:34:34.963
I remember thinking when we first met,
that you were remarkable.

01:34:36.422 --> 01:34:38.842
You wanted to do something truly great.

01:34:40.176 --> 01:34:41.803
And I did, too.

01:34:42.887 --> 01:34:44.556
I still do.

01:34:45.598 --> 01:34:49.811
Raise the white flag. Concede to Sculley.
I'm begging you.

01:34:50.270 --> 01:34:51.312
No.

01:34:51.729 --> 01:34:53.022
You can't win this one.

01:34:53.106 --> 01:34:55.942
Whose side are you on, Mike?

01:34:56.734 --> 01:34:58.444
Because there are sides now.

01:34:58.528 --> 01:35:01.281
And you're either with me
or you're against me.

01:35:03.908 --> 01:35:05.869
Are you with me, Mike?

01:35:08.079 --> 01:35:10.915
Yes, Steve. I'm with you.

01:35:12.542 --> 01:35:13.626
Okay.

01:35:16.462 --> 01:35:17.630
Okay.

01:35:25.471 --> 01:35:27.932
Those in favor of John Sculley.

01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:44.657
All in favor of Steve Jobs.

01:35:56.336 --> 01:35:57.629
Mike.

01:35:57.712 --> 01:36:00.798
Every Board member's vote
must be accounted for.

01:36:08.848 --> 01:36:10.141
Mike?

01:36:18.149 --> 01:36:19.400
Sculley.

01:36:23.613 --> 01:36:25.365
I vote for Sculley.

01:36:58.898 --> 01:37:03.277
So, now what do we do?

01:39:15.910 --> 01:39:18.538
<i>Apple's market value has eroded
in the past several years,</i>

01:39:18.621 --> 01:39:22.291
<i>which led to the ousting
of former chief John Sculley in 1993.</i>

01:39:26.420 --> 01:39:28.339
<i>Ed Woolard, former CEO of DuPont,</i>

01:39:28.422 --> 01:39:30.258
<i>has joined Apple as Chairman of the Board.</i>

01:39:32.135 --> 01:39:35.763
<i>New CEO Gil Amelio says
sweeping changes are necessary.</i>

01:39:37.682 --> 01:39:41.144
<i>Jobs' computer software company NEXT,
has entered into buyout talks</i>

01:39:41.227 --> 01:39:43.146
<i>with his former company, Apple Computer.</i>

01:40:22.810 --> 01:40:26.105
Hey, will you wake up Lisa and see
if she wants breakfast?

01:40:26.564 --> 01:40:27.773
Yeah.

01:40:30.276 --> 01:40:31.569
Lisa?

01:40:33.946 --> 01:40:36.157
Lisa? Come on.

01:40:36.574 --> 01:40:38.784
Are you gonna sleep all day, huh?

01:40:39.076 --> 01:40:40.536
Oh, go away.

01:40:40.620 --> 01:40:43.289
Why? I say all day because it's 10:00.

01:40:43.998 --> 01:40:45.249
Laurene made you breakfast.

01:40:45.583 --> 01:40:47.293
I'm not hungry.

01:40:48.044 --> 01:40:51.297
Well, you can't sleep all winter break.

01:40:51.756 --> 01:40:52.965
Yes, I can.

01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:04.185
Reed! Reed!

01:41:05.061 --> 01:41:07.647
Can we not run in the garden? Please?

01:41:09.106 --> 01:41:10.942
Thank you.

01:41:13.027 --> 01:41:14.695
Were you able to get Lisa up?

01:41:17.073 --> 01:41:22.411
Well, how can a human being
sleep that much?

01:41:25.248 --> 01:41:28.417
She... I don't know if she's coming or not.

01:41:29.293 --> 01:41:33.506
I'm going to the farmer's market today.
Just gonna get a few things.

01:41:34.173 --> 01:41:35.883
You have any plans?
You want to come with me?

01:41:43.557 --> 01:41:45.309
I said do you have plans?

01:41:45.393 --> 01:41:46.435
Today?

01:41:46.936 --> 01:41:50.856
Well, Gil Amelio is gonna stop by.

01:41:52.733 --> 01:41:55.403
They're transitioning in some of our software.

01:41:58.781 --> 01:41:59.949
Okay.

01:42:01.367 --> 01:42:04.829
I'm... I'm just helping them out.
They just need a little help.

01:42:09.208 --> 01:42:10.543
Oh, boy.

01:42:11.836 --> 01:42:13.838
I'm in trouble, aren't I?

01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:18.050
Steve, what can I do
to convince you to come back?

01:42:18.134 --> 01:42:19.385
What can you do to convince me

01:42:19.468 --> 01:42:22.430
<i>I wouldn't be boarding the Titanic, Gil?</i>

01:42:24.015 --> 01:42:29.437
Because I know how you feel about Apple.
What NEXT could never be.

01:42:30.980 --> 01:42:33.274
Plus, you know, considering that you now own

01:42:33.357 --> 01:42:35.526
a million and a half shares of Apple,

01:42:35.609 --> 01:42:38.612
I mean, that's a tangible investment, too.

01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:41.198
You guys must be pretty desperate.

01:42:42.450 --> 01:42:44.160
We're not desperate.

01:42:45.786 --> 01:42:47.913
How are things going with the Newton?

01:42:48.664 --> 01:42:51.208
Look, don't blame me for the failures
of the last regime.

01:42:51.292 --> 01:42:53.252
It's not as bad as you think.

01:42:54.503 --> 01:42:56.839
You're overseeing massive layoffs.

01:42:56.922 --> 01:42:59.133
Apple stock just set another record low.

01:42:59.842 --> 01:43:02.845
And you're four months from insolvency, Gil.

01:43:03.179 --> 01:43:04.555
I'd say that's pretty bad.

01:43:05.181 --> 01:43:07.308
Well, yeah. In order to fix what's broken,

01:43:07.391 --> 01:43:09.602
some sacrifices are necessary. All right?

01:43:09.685 --> 01:43:12.355
Steve, what do you need?

01:43:13.230 --> 01:43:14.273
Name it.

01:43:37.463 --> 01:43:39.173
- Steve.
- Gil.

01:43:42.259 --> 01:43:43.260
Steve.

01:43:44.470 --> 01:43:45.596
Mike.

01:43:45.971 --> 01:43:47.473
It's nice to see you.

01:43:54.230 --> 01:43:55.564
Come on, I'll show you around.

01:43:55.648 --> 01:43:57.858
No, Gil, don't worry about it.
I'll give him the tour.

01:43:58.275 --> 01:43:59.276
You sure?

01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:01.821
Yeah, sure. No problem. Come on.

01:44:01.904 --> 01:44:03.406
That's great.

01:44:04.907 --> 01:44:06.617
You guys go ahead. I'll...

01:44:07.993 --> 01:44:09.662
I'll catch up.

01:44:11.330 --> 01:44:13.499
<i>There's something I always
wanted you to know, Steve.</i>

01:44:15.501 --> 01:44:17.253
It was never my call.

01:44:17.628 --> 01:44:18.879
Let's not do this, Mike.

01:44:18.963 --> 01:44:22.091
No, this is important.
You know, I tried.

01:44:23.843 --> 01:44:26.303
I wanted you here. I always did.

01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:29.807
It's too bad it took me so long
to get you back.

01:44:30.516 --> 01:44:31.892
Oh, I'm not back.

01:44:32.985 --> 01:44:34.520
Yeah. You will be.

01:44:35.229 --> 01:44:36.439
We'll see about that.

01:44:36.522 --> 01:44:41.485
You know, I'm gonna show myself around.
I'll take it from here.

01:44:46.782 --> 01:44:48.325
Son of a bitch.

01:45:25.738 --> 01:45:27.281
Who did these?

01:45:28.532 --> 01:45:30.117
I did, sir.

01:45:34.788 --> 01:45:35.873
Who are you?

01:45:36.790 --> 01:45:40.044
Jonathan Ive. I'm Director of Industrial Design.

01:45:42.004 --> 01:45:43.756
Why are you still here?

01:45:45.090 --> 01:45:46.842
It's 11:00 a.m. on a Monday.

01:45:47.092 --> 01:45:48.135
No.

01:45:48.677 --> 01:45:52.932
Why are you still here at Apple?

01:45:53.807 --> 01:45:56.143
This isn't the company I built.

01:45:56.227 --> 01:45:59.063
There's no taste, no style.

01:46:00.022 --> 01:46:01.732
No design.

01:46:01.941 --> 01:46:06.111
So unless they're shackling you here,
why do you stay?

01:46:09.865 --> 01:46:14.203
Well, sir, I guess I would say
there are still

01:46:14.286 --> 01:46:16.330
those of us that believe
in what Apple stood for.

01:46:18.249 --> 01:46:19.625
What you stood for.

01:46:20.626 --> 01:46:22.503
What do you think I stood for?

01:46:24.296 --> 01:46:25.756
I think...

01:46:28.425 --> 01:46:31.720
I think you believe that the computer,

01:46:31.804 --> 01:46:35.099
or the Walkman, or whatever it may be,

01:46:35.766 --> 01:46:38.519
should be a natural extension of the individual.

01:46:39.478 --> 01:46:41.480
And it's that mission,

01:46:41.730 --> 01:46:47.111
that devotion to quality,
and ideals, and heart...

01:46:49.321 --> 01:46:53.659
That's what keeps us here.
That we might do it once more.

01:47:24.481 --> 01:47:26.859
Okay. Whatever you're working on,

01:47:27.526 --> 01:47:29.278
the rest of the day
I want you to forget it.

01:47:31.322 --> 01:47:34.283
I want everyone to design something new.

01:47:34.908 --> 01:47:36.994
I don't care what it is,
I don't care if it's technology,

01:47:37.077 --> 01:47:39.622
just create something.

01:47:41.707 --> 01:47:43.292
Something useful.

01:47:44.293 --> 01:47:45.711
Something you care about.

01:47:54.637 --> 01:47:55.721
Steve.

01:47:58.349 --> 01:48:00.225
We're glad you're back.

01:48:01.894 --> 01:48:03.395
I'm not back.

01:48:07.775 --> 01:48:08.984
Yet.

01:48:21.830 --> 01:48:23.123
Steve.

01:48:31.632 --> 01:48:32.800
Junk.

01:48:32.883 --> 01:48:34.968
Steve, you met our Chairman, Ed Woolard.

01:48:35.302 --> 01:48:37.012
- Steve.
- Hi.

01:48:40.641 --> 01:48:41.709
Look...

01:48:41.975 --> 01:48:44.895
I know all about the bad blood
you must taste.

01:48:44.978 --> 01:48:50.317
And I understand your hesitation to trust me.
But I just want you to know

01:48:51.110 --> 01:48:54.530
I am not Arthur Rock. I'm your friend.

01:48:56.573 --> 01:48:57.658
Okay.

01:48:59.201 --> 01:49:01.787
So, can we take a minute to talk?

01:49:02.496 --> 01:49:03.497
Apparently.

01:49:03.706 --> 01:49:04.748
Today's paper.

01:49:05.416 --> 01:49:07.543
I'm sure you've seen the news.

01:49:08.377 --> 01:49:10.629
I'm sorry, Ed, you're gonna have
to be more specific.

01:49:11.046 --> 01:49:15.384
Our shares dropped 7.5% overnight.

01:49:16.009 --> 01:49:17.970
It's the lowest it's been in 10 years.

01:49:18.220 --> 01:49:20.806
Last week an unidentified investor

01:49:21.390 --> 01:49:23.642
dropped one point five million shares.

01:49:25.018 --> 01:49:27.938
Put a real scare into the marketplace, Steve.

01:49:28.689 --> 01:49:30.234
One point five million shares?

01:49:33.902 --> 01:49:36.822
I guess the stockholders
must be getting restless.

01:49:38.782 --> 01:49:40.367
<i>We want you here, Steve.</i>

01:49:40.826 --> 01:49:43.287
I'm here. As a consultant.

01:49:43.787 --> 01:49:45.289
As CEO.

01:49:47.458 --> 01:49:48.709
- CEO?
- Yeah.

01:49:48.792 --> 01:49:50.127
At least in the interim.

01:49:51.295 --> 01:49:52.463
And Gil?

01:49:52.546 --> 01:49:54.506
Yeah, well, Gil's halfway out the door.

01:49:54.882 --> 01:49:57.134
He has to see the writing on the wall.

01:49:57.217 --> 01:49:59.428
At least if he's not too proud to admit it.

01:49:59.511 --> 01:50:03.599
Oh, he's going to try to force you out,
and make a case against you.

01:50:03.682 --> 01:50:05.726
Where have I seen this before?

01:50:06.393 --> 01:50:08.479
Gil's on the ledge.
He doesn't have a play here.

01:50:08.562 --> 01:50:11.064
All we need is a little push from you.

01:50:11.398 --> 01:50:14.026
If you want to get back what you lost,
this is the time.

01:50:16.403 --> 01:50:20.157
I never lost it.
It was stolen from me.

01:50:27.414 --> 01:50:31.210
There's no sex left in computers.
No curves.

01:50:32.336 --> 01:50:35.464
Now, if computers are for art, and beauty,

01:50:35.547 --> 01:50:38.759
and global interconnectivity,
why are they so ugly?

01:50:39.802 --> 01:50:43.138
You know, it should be artful.
But no one cares.

01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:48.644
The world may mistakenly see computers
only in black and white,

01:50:49.645 --> 01:50:53.565
but we live, and we dream
and we paint in color.

01:50:55.234 --> 01:50:57.694
And we think the computer should, too.

01:51:04.284 --> 01:51:05.536
What do you think?

01:51:10.999 --> 01:51:15.087
Jony, I always want you to be honest with me.

01:51:17.923 --> 01:51:19.383
No matter what.

01:51:20.259 --> 01:51:22.469
Just be brutally honest.

01:51:24.972 --> 01:51:26.265
Understand?

01:51:26.682 --> 01:51:28.225
Understand.

01:51:30.769 --> 01:51:32.563
What do you think?

01:51:34.439 --> 01:51:36.817
I think, I think the blue,

01:51:39.528 --> 01:51:40.696
it's not quite right.

01:51:43.115 --> 01:51:46.827
Here's a dopey idea.
What if we put the speakers inside?

01:51:49.705 --> 01:51:51.915
Yeah, Steve, Gil Amelio and the board

01:51:51.999 --> 01:51:54.167
are not gonna allow that. No way.

01:51:57.296 --> 01:51:59.923
We're not gonna ask for permission.

01:52:01.341 --> 01:52:03.302
Steve's done an admirable job assisting me

01:52:03.385 --> 01:52:06.054
as an advisor during this, this period.

01:52:06.305 --> 01:52:11.101
And while I commend his actions,
and his initiatives,

01:52:11.602 --> 01:52:14.897
I believe it's now
in our best interest to move on,

01:52:15.063 --> 01:52:18.817
and relieve Steve of his advisory role
in this company.

01:52:20.402 --> 01:52:21.403
I agree, Gil.

01:52:22.988 --> 01:52:24.072
You do?

01:52:24.156 --> 01:52:27.993
I do think it's time Steve step out
of his current role, yes.

01:52:29.119 --> 01:52:30.120
Steve?

01:52:30.787 --> 01:52:31.788
Thank you, Ed.

01:52:33.457 --> 01:52:37.586
I'd like to present the Board
my vision for the future of Apple.

01:52:38.837 --> 01:52:41.131
We're not Microsoft or Dell.

01:52:41.673 --> 01:52:44.343
So we need to stop trying to be that.

01:52:46.178 --> 01:52:51.391
We need to go back to who we are,
and what we do best,

01:52:51.475 --> 01:52:53.936
and throw away everything else.

01:52:54.394 --> 01:52:55.437
Here's how we're gonna do it.

01:52:55.520 --> 01:52:57.314
We're gonna build a new line of computers

01:52:57.397 --> 01:52:59.191
for the home, and for the office.

01:53:00.025 --> 01:53:03.028
We're gonna build a new operating system
on the backbone of NEXT.

01:53:04.446 --> 01:53:06.740
The next generation of Macintosh.

01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:10.035
And we're gonna kill every other project.

01:53:10.994 --> 01:53:12.120
Everything.

01:53:12.204 --> 01:53:15.791
This company will not make shit anymore.

01:53:16.708 --> 01:53:19.086
We're also gonna double down
on the advertising budget.

01:53:19.169 --> 01:53:22.673
Chiat Day will be the only
advertising agency we use.

01:53:22.839 --> 01:53:24.800
Just like back in the old days.

01:53:25.550 --> 01:53:26.760
In short,

01:53:28.053 --> 01:53:29.930
we're gonna make Apple cool again.

01:53:31.306 --> 01:53:33.433
But I will not be able to move forward

01:53:34.559 --> 01:53:39.022
without the Board's permission
to operate under complete autonomy.

01:53:39.856 --> 01:53:43.694
I'll be made a full voting member of the Board.
And lastly...

01:53:46.488 --> 01:53:48.073
Interim CEO.

01:53:51.076 --> 01:53:52.452
Now, hold on.

01:53:53.829 --> 01:53:56.832
I'm the CEO, and this is...

01:53:58.875 --> 01:54:01.169
Look, you put me in this position.

01:54:01.628 --> 01:54:06.008
Apple is like a ship with a hole in the bottom,
and it's leaking water.

01:54:06.091 --> 01:54:08.051
And it's my job to make sure that

01:54:08.135 --> 01:54:10.220
we point the ship in the right direction.

01:54:10.303 --> 01:54:12.973
So why don't you let me do my job?

01:54:13.432 --> 01:54:15.684
All right, let's put this to a vote.

01:54:17.060 --> 01:54:18.562
Those in favor?

01:54:26.570 --> 01:54:28.196
What the hell?

01:54:29.364 --> 01:54:30.365
Ed?

01:54:32.576 --> 01:54:33.577
Mike?

01:54:34.202 --> 01:54:37.164
Sorry, Gil. Nothing personal.

01:54:46.923 --> 01:54:49.718
<i>When you grow up,
you tend to get told</i>

01:54:49.801 --> 01:54:52.596
<i>the world is the way that it is,</i>

01:54:52.971 --> 01:54:55.849
<i>your life is just to live your life
inside the world</i>

01:54:56.433 --> 01:54:59.478
<i>and try not to bash into the walls too much.</i>

01:54:59.686 --> 01:55:01.897
<i>But that's a very limited life.</i>

01:55:02.272 --> 01:55:04.191
<i>Life can be much broader,</i>

01:55:04.274 --> 01:55:07.235
<i>once you discover one simple fact.</i>

01:55:08.111 --> 01:55:10.572
<i>And that is that everything around you</i>

01:55:10.864 --> 01:55:12.365
<i>that you call life</i>

01:55:12.699 --> 01:55:15.869
<i>was made up by people that
are no smarter than you.</i>

01:55:16.453 --> 01:55:19.414
<i>And you can change it.
You can influence it.</i>

01:55:19.498 --> 01:55:23.085
<i>You can build your own things,
that other people can use.</i>

01:55:23.168 --> 01:55:26.463
<i>It's to shake off this erroneous notion</i>

01:55:26.546 --> 01:55:27.964
<i>that life is just there,</i>

01:55:28.048 --> 01:55:30.717
<i>and you're just gonna live in it,
versus embrace it.</i>

01:55:30.801 --> 01:55:34.471
<i>Change it. Improve it.
Make your mark upon it.</i>

01:55:34.554 --> 01:55:38.892
<i>And once you learn that,
you'll never be the same again.</i>

01:55:40.727 --> 01:55:42.604
But in our cash position...

01:55:42.687 --> 01:55:44.022
Mr. CEO.

01:55:44.773 --> 01:55:45.857
Mike.

01:55:45.941 --> 01:55:48.026
You wanted to talk to me?

01:55:48.151 --> 01:55:50.445
Welcome. Please. Have a seat.

01:55:50.987 --> 01:55:52.781
Ed. Hey, Gareth.

01:55:53.240 --> 01:55:54.241
Mike.

01:55:58.787 --> 01:55:59.913
What's this?

01:56:00.539 --> 01:56:01.665
It's an opportunity.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.461
I haven't seen Bernard around
for a few days.

01:56:06.545 --> 01:56:08.755
Where's Katherine, Delano?

01:56:08.922 --> 01:56:12.300
Mr. Lewis and Mrs. Hudson
made a difficult decision easier

01:56:12.801 --> 01:56:15.220
by agreeing to step down from the Board.

01:56:15.512 --> 01:56:16.513
Really?

01:56:16.596 --> 01:56:20.767
They both agreed to accept
incredibly generous golden parachutes.

01:56:21.393 --> 01:56:24.646
The same opportunity is detailed
inside that envelope.

01:56:25.522 --> 01:56:27.399
So you're forcing us out?

01:56:27.816 --> 01:56:28.900
With good reason.

01:56:28.984 --> 01:56:30.110
And what's that?

01:56:30.193 --> 01:56:31.820
The current arrangement is

01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:34.322
inhibiting.

01:56:35.407 --> 01:56:37.993
I can't hold everyone's hand
while we cross the street, Mike.

01:56:38.076 --> 01:56:40.871
And so your next big move
is to eradicate your Board?

01:56:40.954 --> 01:56:42.455
And you think you can just do that?

01:56:42.539 --> 01:56:46.334
I'm sorry, Mike. But it's time.

01:56:47.252 --> 01:56:49.963
Take the parachute. It's more than fair.

01:56:57.971 --> 01:56:59.723
Twenty years.

01:57:03.435 --> 01:57:05.562
You know, I told myself
I'd be out of here

01:57:05.645 --> 01:57:07.731
while I was still in my thirties.

01:57:08.899 --> 01:57:13.111
And now look at me.
I'm practically an old man.

01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:23.246
Gentlemen.

01:57:23.997 --> 01:57:25.207
Thanks, Mike.

01:57:38.511 --> 01:57:39.596
So...

01:57:40.847 --> 01:57:43.183
What are we gonna do now?

01:57:50.899 --> 01:57:53.568
We're gonna put a dent in the universe.

01:58:03.328 --> 01:58:04.579
Here's to the crazy ones.

01:58:06.706 --> 01:58:08.708
<i>The misfits,</i>

01:58:09.125 --> 01:58:10.710
<i>the rebels,</i>

01:58:11.628 --> 01:58:13.338
<i>the troublemakers,</i>

01:58:13.838 --> 01:58:16.383
<i>the round pegs in the square holes,</i>

01:58:17.425 --> 01:58:20.011
the ones who see things differently.

01:58:20.720 --> 01:58:22.514
<i>They're not fond of rules,</i>

01:58:23.056 --> 01:58:26.184
<i>and they have no respect
for the status quo.</i>

01:58:27.811 --> 01:58:29.896
You can quote them,

01:58:29.980 --> 01:58:31.773
<i>disagree with them,</i>

01:58:31.856 --> 01:58:33.900
<i>glorify or vilify them.</i>

01:58:34.943 --> 01:58:36.569
<i>About the only thing you can't do</i>

01:58:37.237 --> 01:58:39.197
<i>is ignore them.</i>

01:58:39.531 --> 01:58:41.241
<i>Because they change things.</i>

01:58:41.908 --> 01:58:44.286
They push the human race forward.

01:58:45.745 --> 01:58:47.956
<i>And while some may see them
as the crazy ones,</i>

01:58:51.042 --> 01:58:52.711
<i>we see genius.</i>

01:58:53.878 --> 01:58:56.256
Because the people who are crazy enough

01:58:56.339 --> 01:58:58.675
to think they can change the world

01:59:00.385 --> 01:59:02.178
are the ones who do.

01:59:10.186 --> 01:59:11.771
How was that?
