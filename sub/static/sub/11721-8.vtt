Look out!

00:35.301 --> 00:36.539
Oh, my God!

00:36.541 --> 00:38.371
Did we hit it?

00:38.373 --> 00:39.907
Looks okay to me.

00:39.909 --> 00:41.811
This is Riley.
The Kealoha's dog.

00:41.813 --> 00:42.876
Babe, we should go.

00:42.878 --> 00:44.812
We can't just leave him.

00:44.814 --> 00:46.748
Hello?

00:46.750 --> 00:47.884
Mrs. Kealoha?

00:47.886 --> 00:49.189
We found Riley.
Are you home?

00:49.191 --> 00:50.717
Hello?

00:50.719 --> 00:52.453
Is anybody home?

00:52.455 --> 00:54.294
Hello?

00:54.296 --> 00:55.590
Mrs. Kealoha?

00:55.592 --> 00:57.727
Are you home?

00:57.729 --> 00:58.927
Anybody?

01:00.233 --> 01:02.600
Hello?

01:02.602 --> 01:04.641
Hello? Mrs. Kealoha?

01:04.643 --> 01:06.842
Are you home?

Hey!

Oh-ho!

02:21.474 --> 02:23.345
Aloha, Stevie.

02:23.347 --> 02:25.977
Oh.
Oh, it's so good to see you, Aunt Deb.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.114
It's so good to see you.
Oh, honey.

02:27.116 --> 02:29.084
Well, it's good to be seen.

02:29.086 --> 02:31.020
Oh, honey, before you ask,

02:31.022 --> 02:33.092
I-I don't know where
your mother is.

02:33.094 --> 02:35.092
Your sister said
that you called.

02:35.094 --> 02:36.996
She doesn't know where
Doris is, either.

02:36.998 --> 02:38.492
I'm so sorry.
No, it's...

02:40.462 --> 02:42.628
Tell me about your trip.
How was it? Was it good?

02:42.630 --> 02:43.996
It was amazing!

02:43.998 --> 02:46.405
Here, I was a little worried
because we booked it

02:46.407 --> 02:49.541
after my last round of
chemo and I-I didn't know

02:49.543 --> 02:52.278
if I'd be up to the
trip, but, sweetheart,

02:52.280 --> 02:56.151
that sea air is
just what I needed.

02:56.153 --> 02:57.447
Treatments were rough, huh?

02:57.449 --> 02:59.951
Kiddo, “rough” doesn't
begin to describe it, but

02:59.953 --> 03:02.656
the doc says the
tumor in my brain

03:02.658 --> 03:04.592
has shrunk half its size.

03:04.594 --> 03:06.864
So I guess the poison works.

03:06.866 --> 03:07.864
Well, you look great.

03:07.866 --> 03:09.496
A little makeup and a good wig

03:09.498 --> 03:12.136
hides a multitude of sins.

03:12.138 --> 03:13.369
Listen, I'm so glad

03:13.371 --> 03:14.969
you decided to fight back, Deb.

03:14.971 --> 03:16.873
You can thank Leonard for that.

03:16.875 --> 03:18.505
He's the one who
talked me into

03:18.507 --> 03:20.376
getting into the ring.
Where is he by the way?

03:20.378 --> 03:22.345
Honey? Ooh-hoo.

03:22.347 --> 03:23.681
Over here.

03:24.651 --> 03:27.850
And you file
that subpoena, Stan.

03:27.852 --> 03:30.650
Your old boss
owes you the money.

03:30.652 --> 03:33.522
I thought your boyfriend
was a shop teacher.

03:33.524 --> 03:34.954
Why's he, uh,

03:34.956 --> 03:36.690
why's he handing out
legal advice?

03:36.692 --> 03:38.498
Well, he just likes
to be helpful, that's all.

03:38.500 --> 03:39.763
Sweetheart!

03:40.765 --> 03:42.867
Darling?

03:42.869 --> 03:44.099
This is Steve.

03:44.101 --> 03:45.299
Steve?

03:45.301 --> 03:46.371
Leonard Cassano.

03:46.373 --> 03:47.707
Nice to meet you, Leonard.

03:47.709 --> 03:48.675
Welcome to Hawaii.

03:48.677 --> 03:50.876
I finally made it to paradise.

03:53.710 --> 03:56.716
Honey, we're on land
five minutes already.

03:56.718 --> 03:58.583
When are you gonna
give him the news?

03:58.585 --> 03:59.889
What news?

03:59.891 --> 04:01.122
Oh...

04:01.997 --> 04:03.766
Well, short version.

04:03.768 --> 04:05.671
Leonard popped the question

04:05.673 --> 04:08.274
and I said yes!

04:08.276 --> 04:09.876
You're engaged?
Yeah.

04:09.878 --> 04:11.516
Well, you've been dating
for a couple months.

04:11.518 --> 04:12.814
What's the rush?

04:12.816 --> 04:14.886
Oh, my pragmatic nephew.

04:14.888 --> 04:17.654
Never one for romance
or the grand gesture.

04:17.656 --> 04:20.221
Honey, you know that
country western song

04:20.224 --> 04:22.590
“Live Like You Were Dying”?

04:22.592 --> 04:24.927
Yeah.
Well, it makes more sense

04:24.929 --> 04:26.799
when you're actually dying.

04:26.801 --> 04:28.663
I've got my tumor.

04:28.665 --> 04:30.935
Leonard is stage IV leukemia.

04:31.737 --> 04:33.808
We've got no time to waste.

04:33.810 --> 04:35.472
And I knew Deb was the one.

04:35.474 --> 04:38.712
The moment I saw her
at that cancer support group.

04:38.714 --> 04:40.512
Okay, so you're
gonna have a nice

04:40.514 --> 04:41.817
long engagement though, right?

04:41.819 --> 04:42.881
Make some plans.

04:42.883 --> 04:44.385
Plans are made.
We're tying the knot

04:44.387 --> 04:46.785
tomorrow at 6:00 p.m.

04:46.787 --> 04:47.953
Okay, hold on. Hold...

04:47.955 --> 04:49.657
Excuse me. Hold on
just a second now.

04:49.659 --> 04:51.194
Um...

04:51.196 --> 04:54.426
Because Mary will be devastated.

04:54.428 --> 04:56.194
Your sister already
gave us her blessing.

04:56.196 --> 04:58.530
And she can't come anyway
because little Joanie

04:58.532 --> 04:59.738
has an ear infection.

04:59.740 --> 05:00.938
Sonny?

05:02.740 --> 05:06.178
Can you do me a solid and grab
our bags for us, would you?

05:09.475 --> 05:11.649
Mahalo.

05:11.651 --> 05:12.850
You just made his year.

05:12.852 --> 05:14.218
Can't take it
with you, right?

05:15.916 --> 05:17.753
Right.

05:17.755 --> 05:19.121
Excuse me for a sec.

05:19.123 --> 05:21.585
Yeah, Chin.

05:21.587 --> 05:24.288
Work. He's got to go.
That was work.

05:24.290 --> 05:25.423
I got to go.
It's okay.

05:25.425 --> 05:26.759
We can get ourselves
to the hotel.

05:26.761 --> 05:28.063
And you'll call me later?
Of course.

05:28.065 --> 05:30.263
I love you.
I love you.

05:31.697 --> 05:33.063
Leonard, nice to meet you.

05:34.369 --> 05:36.535
Pleasure's all mine.

05:39.104 --> 05:41.638
So, good news is
Deb's feeling better and she's in love.

05:41.640 --> 05:42.973
Bad news is you don't
like her boyfriend...

05:42.975 --> 05:44.206
Fiancé, fiancé, okay?

05:44.208 --> 05:45.742
Soon to be husband.
Tomorrow actually.

05:45.744 --> 05:47.078
All right?
Mm-hmm.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.182
It's not that I don't
like him.

05:48.184 --> 05:49.317
There's something
off about him.

05:49.319 --> 05:50.678
Off, off.
What do you mean “off”?

05:50.680 --> 05:53.454
He's a retired teacher
and he tips like a rapper.

05:53.456 --> 05:55.254
Oh, well, you can't
take it with you, right?

05:55.256 --> 05:56.318
That's what he said!

05:56.320 --> 05:58.454
And since when does
a retired shop teacher

05:58.456 --> 05:59.526
hand out legal advice?

05:59.528 --> 06:00.558
I don't know.

06:00.560 --> 06:01.958
Maybe he's a big fan
of Judge Judy.

06:01.960 --> 06:03.327
You know what else?
What?

06:03.329 --> 06:04.694
His hands.
His hands?

06:04.696 --> 06:05.998
His hands were smooth.
They're beautiful.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.334
It's like...

06:07.336 --> 06:09.134
They should be rough.
He works with tools, right?

06:09.136 --> 06:11.166
Ah, you just said
he was retired.

06:11.168 --> 06:13.271
Okay, I think personally that
you are looking for trouble.

06:13.273 --> 06:15.071
But if you are
really concerned,

06:15.073 --> 06:17.310
I would say maybe put somebody
on it, ease your mind.

06:17.312 --> 06:18.510
I already got Jerry on it.

06:18.512 --> 06:20.078
Oh, Mr. Conspiracy.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.646
That ought to ease
your mind for sure.

06:21.648 --> 06:23.518
Nice work.

06:23.520 --> 06:25.183
Yo.
Hey.

06:25.185 --> 06:28.053
So, our victim's names are
David and Kate Kealoha.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.117
It looks like

06:29.119 --> 06:30.485
they were sitting down
to watch some TV,

06:30.487 --> 06:32.389
and someone came in the back
with a shotgun,

06:32.391 --> 06:33.925
got very generous
with the ammo.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.997
Hollow core slugs

06:37.999 --> 06:39.462
filled with buckshot.

06:39.464 --> 06:41.965
Designed to do maximum damage.

06:41.967 --> 06:43.037
These people were massacred.

06:43.039 --> 06:44.373
A hyperbolic,

06:44.375 --> 06:47.543
and yet also an astute
assessment, Detective Williams.

06:47.545 --> 06:49.511
The firepower
that was utilized

06:49.513 --> 06:51.743
is a very clear definition
of overkill.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.784
What else do we know, Max?
Our male victim,

06:53.786 --> 06:55.480
David Kealoha, was first shot

06:55.482 --> 06:56.816
in the back of the head.

06:56.818 --> 06:58.255
He was seated,
no defensive wounds.

06:58.257 --> 07:00.255
Guy never knew
what hit him.

07:00.257 --> 07:02.087
All right, what about the lady?

07:02.089 --> 07:03.359
The blood spatter on her blouse
indicates she was

07:03.361 --> 07:05.095
beside her husband
when he was shot.

07:05.097 --> 07:07.232
All right, so her husband's hit.
She stands up, turns around

07:07.234 --> 07:09.328
and immediately takes one
center mass.

07:09.330 --> 07:12.600
Both shots were fired
from the lanai entry as well.

07:14.274 --> 07:15.904
Okay, so whoever did this

07:15.906 --> 07:17.208
never even came inside.
We're gonna get

07:17.210 --> 07:18.977
no fingerprints, no DNA.

07:18.979 --> 07:20.545
Good call. So far,
CSU's come up empty.

07:20.547 --> 07:21.745
But we're pulling
traffic cam footage,

07:21.747 --> 07:24.081
hoping that we get
a hit on a vehicle.

07:24.083 --> 07:25.384
Gentlemen, if there's
nothing else,

07:25.386 --> 07:27.080
I'll finish my prelims
and get back to you

07:27.082 --> 07:28.648
with a full report
later today.

07:28.650 --> 07:30.816
Hey.

07:31.923 --> 07:33.225
Where are the kids?

07:33.227 --> 07:34.921
Slept at a friend's
house last night.

07:34.923 --> 07:37.560
HPD picked them up an hour ago.

07:38.666 --> 07:40.232
Travis, Jake?

07:40.234 --> 07:42.329
I'm Steve McGarrett,
this is Detective Williams.

07:42.331 --> 07:43.329
Why can't we go inside?

07:43.331 --> 07:44.665
Why can't we see our parents?

07:44.667 --> 07:45.833
Ah, it's for your own good.

07:45.835 --> 07:47.105
What about Riley?

07:47.107 --> 07:48.505
Our dog. Is he okay?

07:48.507 --> 07:49.609
You still got the dog up top?

07:49.611 --> 07:50.978
Grab the dog, please.

07:50.980 --> 07:52.306
When was the last
time you boys

07:52.308 --> 07:53.610
saw your parents?
Uh...

07:54.580 --> 07:55.778
Around 9:00 last night.

07:55.780 --> 07:57.416
That's when Jake and I
went to Tai's house.

07:57.418 --> 07:58.447
Tai?

07:58.449 --> 07:59.678
He's a friend from school.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.675
Okay, you guys, you
were there all night?

08:01.677 --> 08:03.777
Yeah, just hanging out as usual.

08:03.779 --> 08:04.943
What does that have
to do with anything?

08:04.945 --> 08:06.078
Gentlemen?

08:06.080 --> 08:07.677
Boys, would you
excuse us, please?

08:07.679 --> 08:09.812
I'm Eugene Goodman,
the family attorney.

08:09.814 --> 08:11.546
This is inappropriate.

08:11.548 --> 08:13.450
The boys are
obviously distraught.

08:13.452 --> 08:14.482
I'd like
to take them with me.

08:14.484 --> 08:15.786
Yeah, that's fine.

08:15.788 --> 08:17.082
Uh, we're gonna need to speak
to them a little later.

08:17.084 --> 08:18.818
Well, call my office,
make an appointment

08:18.820 --> 08:20.986
so I can be present.

08:20.988 --> 08:22.090
What, do you think these
boys need an attorney?

08:22.092 --> 08:23.858
That depends.

08:23.860 --> 08:25.290
Are they suspects?

08:26.700 --> 08:28.466
What's the matter, boy?

08:28.468 --> 08:29.963
Why's he acting like that?
What's wrong with him?

08:29.965 --> 08:32.099
Riley.

08:32.101 --> 08:34.034
Hey! Riley!

08:35.308 --> 08:37.410
You think the dog's trying
to tell us something?

08:38.373 --> 08:40.443
Yeah, I do.

08:49.325 --> 08:51.127
So I ran Jake
and Travis Kealoha.

08:51.128 --> 08:52.494
They've never been in
any trouble before.

08:52.496 --> 08:54.463
And there's no records of them
purchasing a shotgun

08:54.465 --> 08:55.535
or shells.

08:55.537 --> 08:56.599
But as it turns out,

08:56.601 --> 08:57.631
there's a whole lot of people

08:57.633 --> 08:58.671
who would've wanted to see

08:58.673 --> 09:00.471
David Kealoha dead.

09:00.473 --> 09:02.375
How many's “a whole lot”?

09:02.377 --> 09:04.111
About 250.
250?

09:04.113 --> 09:06.975
David Kealoha made his money
as an investment banker,

09:06.977 --> 09:08.783
and he was very successful
for a long time,

09:08.785 --> 09:10.551
but then the economy
took a downturn.

09:10.553 --> 09:12.079
Well, Kealoha took
some heavy losses,

09:12.081 --> 09:13.814
but rather than deal
with unhappy clients,

09:13.816 --> 09:16.390
he tried to cover them with
an elaborate pyramid scheme.

09:16.392 --> 09:18.190
But of course
it all fell apart.

09:18.192 --> 09:20.526
SEC was investigating
the guy for over a year.

09:20.528 --> 09:21.694
His company went bankrupt--

09:21.696 --> 09:22.926
all the investments
are gone.

09:22.928 --> 09:24.863
He ruined
a lot of lives.

09:24.865 --> 09:26.199
Yeah, and he
was going to prison.

09:26.201 --> 09:28.432
The SEC was just about
to send their evidence

09:28.434 --> 09:29.832
over to the U.S.
Attorney's office.

09:29.834 --> 09:31.536
Within the month,
he would have been arrested,

09:31.538 --> 09:32.936
his accounts frozen,

09:32.938 --> 09:34.135
and anything he
still owned repossessed.

09:34.137 --> 09:35.439
Maybe one of Kealoha's
swindled clients

09:35.441 --> 09:37.543
didn't think that was
punishment enough

09:37.545 --> 09:39.007
and took matters
into his own hands.

09:39.009 --> 09:40.415
Yeah, well, most live
on the mainland,

09:40.417 --> 09:42.447
but there is one
who's pretty close to home.

09:43.281 --> 09:44.919
That's Tai Gable...

09:44.921 --> 09:46.183
Hold on. Tai Gable?

09:46.185 --> 09:47.486
That's the house
that Jake and Travis

09:47.488 --> 09:49.990
- Kealoha spent last night.
- Yeah. The Gables

09:49.992 --> 09:51.726
are going through
a very nasty divorce.

09:51.728 --> 09:53.526
Jason Gable, as a part
of the settlement,

09:53.528 --> 09:55.726
agreed to supersize
the kid's college funds.

09:55.728 --> 09:58.364
Tai was about eight months away
from collecting his.

09:58.366 --> 10:01.059
David Kealoha lost all of it.
How much?

10:01.061 --> 10:02.109
Over half a mil.

10:02.133 --> 10:04.100
I know if my
best friend's dad stole my money

10:04.101 --> 10:05.731
I'd be pretty pissed.

10:05.733 --> 10:07.003
A double shotgun blast?

10:07.005 --> 10:09.139
Definitely the work
of a pissed-off individual.

10:09.141 --> 10:10.906
Tai Gable's mother
alibi'd those kids.

10:10.908 --> 10:13.970
I mean, she said all three boys
were home from 9:00 p.m.

10:13.972 --> 10:16.610
to when HPD woke them up this morning.
Steve...

10:16.612 --> 10:18.282
take it from me--

10:18.284 --> 10:20.618
if there's one thing
a teenager knows how to do,

10:20.620 --> 10:22.546
is sneak out of the house
when they want.

10:22.548 --> 10:24.018
But we pulled
the traffic footage

10:24.020 --> 10:25.154
from around the Kealoha house.

10:25.156 --> 10:26.618
Tai wasn't in it.
What about

10:26.620 --> 10:28.154
traffic footage
from around the Gable house?

10:28.156 --> 10:29.554
HPD's going through that
right now.

10:29.556 --> 10:31.426
We're gonna go light
a fire under them.

10:31.428 --> 10:32.993
All right. Get them.

10:32.995 --> 10:34.961
Hey. Caught these two trying
to bust through security

10:34.963 --> 10:37.799
out the front.
Sorry to pop in unexpectedly,

10:37.801 --> 10:39.692
but we were across the
street at the courthouse

10:39.694 --> 10:42.330
getting our license, so we thought
we'd come by and say hi.

10:42.332 --> 10:44.330
I'm glad you did.
I'm so glad that they did, too,

10:44.332 --> 10:45.930
'cause I get to hear
all about their cruise

10:45.932 --> 10:47.266
they just took--
this place is amazing.

10:47.268 --> 10:48.602
They had mini golf,

10:48.604 --> 10:50.570
zip line, spa treatments.

10:50.572 --> 10:51.617
This guy's hands--

10:51.641 --> 10:53.171
smoothest hands I ever
felt in my entire life.

10:53.172 --> 10:55.474
Deb insisted we both
get Mani-pedis

10:55.476 --> 10:56.842
before the ceremony.

10:56.844 --> 10:57.978
Danny here was

10:57.980 --> 11:01.314
- busting my chops.
- Yeah, he does that.

11:01.316 --> 11:02.314
Well,
I don't care.

11:02.316 --> 11:03.650
This our one and
only wedding,

11:03.652 --> 11:07.133
and I just figured we
ought to look our best, hands and feet.

11:07.134 --> 11:08.986
Makes sense to me.
Make sense to you?

11:08.988 --> 11:09.922
Complete sense.

11:09.924 --> 11:10.994
Hey, if you're free

11:10.996 --> 11:12.458
for lunch, I'm buying, Steve.

11:12.460 --> 11:14.058
Oh, I'd love
it for my two

11:14.060 --> 11:16.329
favorite guys to get to know
each other better, huh?

11:16.331 --> 11:17.465
I would love that, too.

11:17.467 --> 11:18.729
Unfortunately,
I'm right in the middle

11:18.731 --> 11:20.065
of this case,
uh, right now.

11:20.067 --> 11:21.168
Hey, Lou,
you remember, uh...

11:21.170 --> 11:22.705
Aunt Deb, you remember Lou Grover?
Oh.

11:22.707 --> 11:23.937
Yeah, yeah. Hi.

11:23.939 --> 11:25.601
And, Lou, this
is Leonard.

11:25.603 --> 11:26.902
- Leonard, nice to meet you.
- Lou. Lou.

11:26.904 --> 11:28.774
Well, I hope maybe
you'll be able to come

11:28.776 --> 11:30.310
to our wedding tomorrow--
Royal Hawaiian.

11:30.312 --> 11:31.478
What do you mean, “maybe”?

11:31.480 --> 11:32.942
I wouldn't miss that
for the world.

11:32.944 --> 11:34.974
Of course I'll be there.
Thank you.

11:34.976 --> 11:36.645
There you go.
Listen, now, that, uh,

11:36.647 --> 11:37.981
traffic cam thing,
it worked out.

11:37.983 --> 11:40.581
Okay, we got a lead here.
I got a lead on the case.

11:40.583 --> 11:41.813
Okay, okay.
Thank you.

11:41.815 --> 11:44.189
He loves me.

11:44.191 --> 11:46.421
I knew he would.

11:47.823 --> 11:49.893
Okay, I don't know,
but I think I might have

11:49.895 --> 11:51.429
cracked the mystery
of the smooth hands.

11:51.431 --> 11:52.693
For you I did that, so...

11:52.695 --> 11:53.932
You know what?

11:53.934 --> 11:55.028
Thank you.

11:55.030 --> 11:56.932
You-you're a big help
to me, Nancy Drew.

11:56.934 --> 11:58.068
Listen, listen,
listen, now.

11:58.070 --> 11:59.700
I just got off
the phone with HPD.

11:59.702 --> 12:00.900
This is what they sent me.

12:00.902 --> 12:02.668
Now, there's no clear
picture of the driver,

12:02.670 --> 12:03.837
but I ran the plate.

12:03.839 --> 12:05.709
This car is registered
to Tai Gable.

12:07.543 --> 12:09.741
Okay, well, either Tai Gable
is lying to his mother

12:09.743 --> 12:12.045
about going out last night,
or she's lying to you.

12:12.047 --> 12:14.117
Well, I say we go ask him.

12:21.560 --> 12:22.894
Hey!

12:22.896 --> 12:24.758
Slow down.
But what, do you take

12:24.760 --> 12:26.366
driving lessons
from McGarrett or what?

12:26.368 --> 12:27.566
You ever been to Chicago?

12:27.568 --> 12:29.502
I've been to Chicago.
Well, in Chicago,

12:29.504 --> 12:31.568
when we tell somebody to
drive, this is how we drive.

12:31.570 --> 12:33.474
And in the snow.

12:33.476 --> 12:35.010
<i>Steve, he's making</i>
<i>a left on Puahi Street.</i>

12:35.012 --> 12:36.378
<i>I got him.</i>

12:48.224 --> 12:49.224
Move, move, move!

12:49.225 --> 12:50.487
Get out of the way!

13:22.526 --> 13:24.060
Tai Gable...

13:24.062 --> 13:25.795
you're under arrest
for murder

13:25.797 --> 13:27.363
and reckless
endangerment.

13:27.365 --> 13:29.563
And messing up my SUV.

13:32.637 --> 13:34.507
Are you insane, man?

13:34.509 --> 13:36.603
I had nothing to do with
the Kealohas getting killed.

13:36.605 --> 13:37.843
Then why'd you run?

13:37.845 --> 13:39.675
When we came to talk
to you, you ran.

13:41.277 --> 13:44.612
The customer I was with,
I was selling him some weed.

13:44.614 --> 13:46.948
Tourists rent scoots,
and sometimes they're looking

13:46.950 --> 13:49.189
to make the drive
to Laniakea Beach

13:49.191 --> 13:53.293
a little bit more scenic,
if you get my meaning.

13:54.127 --> 13:55.829
Please don't tell my boss.

13:57.263 --> 14:00.365
You... I'm sorry, you sell
people, uh, marijuana,

14:00.367 --> 14:01.533
and then you
rent them scooters,

14:01.535 --> 14:03.101
and then you let them
drive around this island

14:03.103 --> 14:04.301
that they've never
been on before,

14:04.303 --> 14:05.869
to crash into things and
potentially kill people?

14:05.871 --> 14:07.373
Is that what you're
saying to me?

14:07.375 --> 14:09.037
We're telling your boss.
We're telling your boss.

14:09.039 --> 14:11.412
Ah, man, this day is the worst.

14:11.414 --> 14:12.780
Today is worse
than when

14:12.782 --> 14:15.148
Mr. Kealoha stole half
a million dollars from you?

14:15.150 --> 14:17.348
He blew my college fund.
So what?

14:17.350 --> 14:20.148
My dad's got plenty more
where that came from.

14:20.150 --> 14:23.524
I'm not exactly
university material, man.

14:23.526 --> 14:25.492
Oh, my God.

14:25.494 --> 14:26.956
Okay, genius.

14:26.958 --> 14:29.092
We still have to know
where you were last night.

14:29.094 --> 14:30.060
Me?
No, I want to know

14:30.062 --> 14:31.532
where he was
last night.

14:31.534 --> 14:32.628
Yes, you.
Nowhere.

14:32.630 --> 14:33.732
Hey, Cheech.

14:33.734 --> 14:34.732
We got traffic video

14:34.734 --> 14:36.004
of your car
blowing a red light

14:36.006 --> 14:37.436
at 20 after midnight.

14:37.438 --> 14:38.468
Where were you?

14:38.470 --> 14:40.405
Maybe, but it wasn't me
driving it.

14:40.407 --> 14:42.973
I smoked a bowl
and fell asleep at 11:00.

14:42.975 --> 14:44.245
Anyone in the house

14:44.247 --> 14:46.509
could have taken my
ride once I was asleep.

14:46.511 --> 14:47.613
Like Jake and Travis?

14:47.615 --> 14:49.381
They ever borrow your
car without asking?

14:51.584 --> 14:52.950
Yeah.

14:52.952 --> 14:54.454
Sometimes.

14:54.456 --> 14:55.686
Sometimes.

14:55.688 --> 14:57.494
Okay.

14:59.528 --> 15:02.463
<i>Thank you for bringing</i>
<i>Tai home.</i>

15:02.465 --> 15:06.070
I promise I'll speak to him
about the drugs.

15:06.072 --> 15:10.573
Although, in Colorado,
it is legal now.

15:10.575 --> 15:13.605
Not if you're under 21,
and not to sell.

15:13.607 --> 15:15.277
Oh.

15:15.279 --> 15:16.773
It's been hard on Tai.

15:16.775 --> 15:18.509
Both my kids.

15:18.511 --> 15:21.317
With their father leaving
last year, so...

15:21.319 --> 15:25.389
I just try to be...
understanding.

15:25.391 --> 15:27.317
Okay. I get it.

15:27.319 --> 15:29.357
You think, uh, maybe they need
a friend more than a mother.

15:29.359 --> 15:32.261
Yeah. Exactly.
I disagree.

15:32.263 --> 15:33.996
Don't cover
for your son.

15:33.998 --> 15:35.164
Don't cover for the
Kealoha boys, either.

15:35.166 --> 15:36.061
I don't understand.

15:36.063 --> 15:37.197
We spoke to
their lawyer.

15:37.199 --> 15:39.100
Both Jake and Travis
say they didn't take

15:39.102 --> 15:40.164
Tai's car out last night.

15:40.166 --> 15:41.364
So, are you saying
that they're lying?

15:41.366 --> 15:43.039
Well, you know,
if you didn't take it,

15:43.041 --> 15:45.272
Tai didn't take it, they didn't
take it, somebody's lying.

15:45.274 --> 15:46.882
Jake and Travis are good kids.

15:46.884 --> 15:48.282
Yeah, well,
sometimes good kids

15:48.284 --> 15:49.419
have bad problems, right?

15:49.421 --> 15:51.053
Jake said they
stayed here a lot.

15:51.055 --> 15:52.485
Was there, uh,

15:52.487 --> 15:54.085
trouble at home?

15:54.087 --> 15:57.725
They just need
a break sometimes.

15:57.727 --> 16:00.092
Their dad could be... demanding.

16:00.094 --> 16:01.596
Demanding in what way?

16:01.598 --> 16:03.427
David wanted them
to be successful.

16:03.429 --> 16:05.930
And for him, success meant
making tons of money.

16:05.932 --> 16:09.370
Nothing was worth doing
if you didn't get paid.

16:09.372 --> 16:11.434
What about their mother?

16:13.444 --> 16:16.411
Kate was more sensitive.

16:16.413 --> 16:18.275
She had a conscience.

16:18.277 --> 16:20.451
When we found out
that David had stolen

16:20.453 --> 16:23.084
my kids' college fund,
it was Kate

16:23.086 --> 16:25.420
who came over here
begging for forgiveness.

16:25.422 --> 16:27.253
I had to forgive her.

16:27.255 --> 16:29.861
I wasn't angry at her anymore,
'cause she had no idea

16:29.863 --> 16:31.595
that her husband
was doing such a thing.

16:31.597 --> 16:34.258
Positive about that?
Oh, yeah.

16:34.260 --> 16:35.963
She was devastated
when she found out.

16:35.965 --> 16:38.470
She felt like their whole
life together had been a lie.

16:38.472 --> 16:41.778
Then, two months ago,
I dropped by unexpectedly,

16:41.780 --> 16:44.581
and I found her unconscious
on the sofa.

16:44.583 --> 16:48.656
She'd-she'd taken a handful
of prescription sleeping pills.

16:48.658 --> 16:50.930
I put her
in a cold shower,

16:50.932 --> 16:52.427
she came around, and I told her,

16:52.429 --> 16:55.035
“You need to be strong
for your sons.

16:55.037 --> 16:56.835
Think about them.”

16:58.037 --> 17:01.203
And she promised me
that she would.

17:02.709 --> 17:05.443
The three of them were so close.

17:05.444 --> 17:06.979
And that's the thing.

17:06.981 --> 17:09.209
The horrible way
that she died.

17:09.211 --> 17:10.311
The violence.

17:10.314 --> 17:11.512
There's no way

17:11.513 --> 17:13.544
that those boys
could have done that to her.

17:13.546 --> 17:15.079
No way.

17:15.080 --> 17:17.151
All right, that woman
is a hot mess.

17:17.153 --> 17:18.855
Think so?
But she makes a good point.

17:18.857 --> 17:20.151
Maybe the kids
hated their dad,

17:20.153 --> 17:21.854
but why would they
kill their mom, too?

17:21.856 --> 17:22.958
I don't know.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.686
Look, with the government
taking everything,

17:24.689 --> 17:26.191
there's zero
inheritance, right?

17:26.193 --> 17:30.167
So the money as a motive
is completely out.

17:30.169 --> 17:31.295
Jerry, what's up?

17:31.297 --> 17:32.567
What's up is it looks like

17:32.569 --> 17:33.735
your Spidey-sense
was right again.

17:33.737 --> 17:35.671
Your aunt's fiancé,
Leonard Cassano,

17:35.673 --> 17:38.504
is not a retired shop teacher
from Queens, New York.

17:38.506 --> 17:41.115
His full name
is Bruce Leonard Cassano.

17:41.117 --> 17:42.643
He's a mob lawyer.

17:42.645 --> 17:44.179
Son of a bitch.

17:44.181 --> 17:45.883
Cassano represented

17:45.885 --> 17:47.715
the Leone family in New York.

17:47.717 --> 17:50.218
And he really came through
for his clients.

17:50.220 --> 17:53.122
Gino Leone beat three
murder raps in ten years.

17:53.124 --> 17:55.258
All right, but everybody's
entitled to a defense, right?

17:55.260 --> 17:57.130
Even a creep like Leone.
Why would Leonard lie

17:57.132 --> 17:58.730
to my Aunt Deb
about who he is?

17:58.732 --> 18:00.834
Yeah, that's probably 'cause of
the evidence tampering.

18:00.836 --> 18:03.834
Nothing was proven,
but the FBI claims

18:03.836 --> 18:06.202
to have wiretaps
of the Leone brothers

18:06.204 --> 18:08.371
discussing a weapon
that Gino used

18:08.373 --> 18:10.707
to murder Andre Ochoa in 2010.

18:10.709 --> 18:14.747
Gino said Cassano
got rid of it for him.

18:26.858 --> 18:28.224
Thank you very much.

18:30.459 --> 18:33.729
So I just hung up the phone with
Kealoha's insurance company.

18:33.731 --> 18:35.569
Even though David was about
to lose everything,

18:35.571 --> 18:37.233
he was still paying
the monthly premium

18:37.235 --> 18:39.503
on a $10 million
life insurance policy.

18:39.505 --> 18:41.687
The beneficiaries on that
policy are Jake and Travis.

18:41.688 --> 18:44.573
Okay, wait a minute. Isn't the government
just gonna take that cash

18:44.575 --> 18:46.437
like they're going to take everything else?
That's what you'd think,

18:46.439 --> 18:48.036
but it actually goes
into a protected trust

18:48.038 --> 18:49.140
that the government can't touch.

18:49.142 --> 18:50.780
And six weeks ago,

18:50.782 --> 18:52.212
they upgraded their policy
to include

18:52.214 --> 18:54.612
a double indemnity clause,
which pays out twice the cash

18:54.614 --> 18:56.884
in the case
of David's accidental death.

18:56.886 --> 18:58.316
That includes death by murder.

18:58.318 --> 19:00.916
Well, nothing says murder like
a shotgun blast to the dome,

19:00.918 --> 19:02.252
right?
All right, so that policy's now worth

19:02.254 --> 19:04.260
$20 million?
Yep.

19:04.262 --> 19:05.756
There's our motive.

19:05.758 --> 19:07.459
It keeps pointing back
to the kids.

19:07.461 --> 19:08.723
Okay, I promise you,

19:08.725 --> 19:09.827
we get those kids alone,

19:09.829 --> 19:11.363
put a scare into one of 'em,

19:11.365 --> 19:12.699
he will rat, they will crack.

19:12.701 --> 19:14.131
I guarantee you.
Yeah,

19:14.133 --> 19:16.098
but that lawyer, he's never gonna let us
get those kids alone.

19:16.100 --> 19:18.834
I'd like to talk to the dog. You should've
seen the dog went after these kids.

19:18.836 --> 19:21.002
It was like a canine
lie detector.

19:22.812 --> 19:24.474
I don't
understand.

19:24.476 --> 19:25.978
You want us to take a polygraph?

19:25.980 --> 19:26.978
Absolutely not.

19:26.980 --> 19:28.281
Hang on a second.

19:28.283 --> 19:30.448
We didn't know anything
about that insurance policy.

19:30.450 --> 19:32.344
And as executor
of the estate,

19:32.346 --> 19:33.584
I can vouch for that.

19:33.586 --> 19:34.679
That's nice. Thank you.

19:34.681 --> 19:36.087
Uh, nothing.
Your parents never

19:36.089 --> 19:37.685
- mentioned anything?
- No.

19:37.687 --> 19:39.116
They never talked
about that stuff with us.

19:39.118 --> 19:40.451
Pass the polygraph,

19:40.453 --> 19:42.052
- we'll believe you.
- This is ridiculous.

19:42.054 --> 19:44.724
As your attorney, I strongly
advise you not to participate.

19:44.726 --> 19:46.356
I advise you
to shut up.

19:46.358 --> 19:47.660
Zip it.
Let these kids think.

19:47.662 --> 19:49.228
Okay? Guys?

19:49.966 --> 19:51.900
Look, somewhere
out there

19:51.902 --> 19:53.564
is the guy
that killed our parents,

19:53.566 --> 19:55.132
but you're not even looking
for him.

19:55.134 --> 19:57.004
We're following the evidence,
Jake.

19:57.006 --> 20:00.141
And you want evidence
that we didn't do it.

20:04.614 --> 20:06.876
So fine.

20:06.878 --> 20:07.916
We'll take the test.

20:07.918 --> 20:09.381
All right. Travis?

20:09.383 --> 20:11.013
Yeah.

20:11.015 --> 20:13.223
Okay.

20:13.225 --> 20:15.693
Okay. We'll set it up.

20:21.870 --> 20:24.003
So?
All right. I mean, Jake's confident.

20:24.005 --> 20:25.875
Did you see the
look on Travis's face?

20:25.877 --> 20:28.107
The kid's scared to
death he's gonna fail.

20:28.109 --> 20:29.675
Maybe the older brother
acted alone, okay?

20:29.677 --> 20:30.979
But pass or fail,
I hate polygraphs.

20:30.981 --> 20:32.179
They're inadmissible in court.

20:32.181 --> 20:33.411
We need something more solid.

20:33.413 --> 20:34.811
Travis doesn't want
to take the test.

20:34.813 --> 20:36.483
Let's see how far he'll
go to get out of it.

20:36.485 --> 20:38.147
By the way, I need
to take an hour

20:38.149 --> 20:39.387
while you wire up Jake.
Is that all right?

20:39.389 --> 20:41.155
I got to go, uh, talk
to my Aunt Deb.

20:41.157 --> 20:42.587
Okay. You sure you want
to do that?

20:42.589 --> 20:44.459
Yeah, she deserves
the truth.

20:44.461 --> 20:45.859
She deserves to be happy, too.
Just my opinion.

20:45.861 --> 20:48.163
But you do...
Good luck. Good luck.

20:48.165 --> 20:50.827
Your lawyer said
we can use this room.

20:52.837 --> 20:54.331
You need anything
while you wait?

20:54.333 --> 20:55.803
Uh, no.

20:55.805 --> 20:57.635
No, I'm okay.
Okay.

21:08.252 --> 21:10.314
It's me.

21:10.316 --> 21:13.050
We have a problem.

21:13.052 --> 21:15.522
Just relax, Mr. Kealoha.

21:15.524 --> 21:17.754
Okay.

21:17.756 --> 21:20.322
Did you take Tai Gable's
car out last night?

21:20.324 --> 21:22.226
No.

21:22.228 --> 21:24.930
Is your name
Jake Kealoha?

21:24.932 --> 21:27.233
Yes.

21:27.235 --> 21:29.401
Did you kill
your parents?

21:29.403 --> 21:31.632
No.

21:43.680 --> 21:45.918
My favorite auntie.

21:45.920 --> 21:48.854
Oh. Oh, honey,
thank you so much,

21:48.856 --> 21:50.886
but I've had lunch already.
I can't.

21:50.888 --> 21:52.822
You have to have a little room
for my delicious

21:52.824 --> 21:54.454
shrimp casserole.

21:54.456 --> 21:58.030
Since you were so rudely denied
the opportunity at Thanksgiving.

21:58.032 --> 21:59.758
I'm pretty sure
she said she's full.

21:59.760 --> 22:01.630
But you know what,
I'll take it. I got some

22:01.632 --> 22:03.230
of those shrimp bucks left over
from the poker game.

22:03.232 --> 22:04.229
They're good from...

22:04.231 --> 22:05.797
2:00 to 4:00
every day, right?

22:05.799 --> 22:08.404
No, no, no, no.
Those expired, sorry.

22:08.406 --> 22:09.468
Bye, Auntie.

22:09.470 --> 22:12.372
Shrimp casserole,
half price.

22:12.374 --> 22:13.707
Come and get it!

22:13.709 --> 22:14.707
Hi.

22:14.709 --> 22:15.842
Is everything okay?

22:15.844 --> 22:18.145
You sounded pretty
serious on the phone.

22:18.147 --> 22:19.881
Well, I-I didn't mean
to worry you, Deb,

22:19.883 --> 22:20.881
but it is serious.

22:20.883 --> 22:22.449
It's about Leonard.

22:22.451 --> 22:24.785
He's lying to you.

22:24.787 --> 22:27.584
He-he's not, he's not
a shop teacher from Queens.

22:27.586 --> 22:29.816
I know, I know.

22:29.818 --> 22:31.992
I know exactly
who he is.

22:31.994 --> 22:34.288
And Leonard isn't
lying to me.

22:34.290 --> 22:36.097
I've been lying to you.
What?

22:38.028 --> 22:39.235
I was afraid you
wouldn't approve

22:39.237 --> 22:41.068
if you knew who
he really was.

22:41.070 --> 22:42.670
Deb, he's involved
with some very bad people.

22:42.672 --> 22:45.278
You know, there's allegations
that he helped destroy evidence.

22:45.280 --> 22:46.407
Leonard says he didn't.

22:46.409 --> 22:48.447
Well, I mean...
And as for the rest of it,

22:48.449 --> 22:49.911
his clients,
all of that,

22:49.913 --> 22:51.718
it's long over.

22:53.552 --> 22:54.814
Look.

22:54.816 --> 22:56.182
Honey...

22:56.184 --> 22:58.254
I know you're
worried about me,

22:58.256 --> 23:00.158
but I can take
care of myself.

23:00.160 --> 23:03.358
And I know from
disappointment.

23:04.928 --> 23:08.966
I thought I was gonna
have a singing career.

23:08.968 --> 23:10.470
It never happened.

23:10.472 --> 23:12.535
And then I
thought maybe...

23:12.537 --> 23:14.175
someday I might
get married

23:14.177 --> 23:16.543
and have babies.

23:16.545 --> 23:18.807
But it was never
the right time.

23:20.578 --> 23:22.480
But you know,
it's okay.

23:22.482 --> 23:24.919
I have no regrets.

23:24.921 --> 23:29.152
But, Steve, the one thing
I never gave up on...

23:29.154 --> 23:31.224
was love.

23:31.226 --> 23:35.592
And I guess it never gave up
on me either because here he is.

23:35.594 --> 23:37.792
At long last.

23:39.631 --> 23:42.628
And now, you know,

23:42.630 --> 23:44.100
I can leave
this earth,

23:44.102 --> 23:48.771
knowing that I have
experienced the most profound

23:48.773 --> 23:52.274
and life-altering
thing a person can.

23:52.276 --> 23:55.274
I just hope
that someday

23:55.276 --> 23:57.810
you'll know how
wonderful that feels.

23:59.244 --> 24:02.178
Steve, you're so willing
to risk your life.

24:02.180 --> 24:04.849
When are you gonna be
willing to risk your heart?

24:04.851 --> 24:06.952
I did.

24:06.954 --> 24:10.390
Then where's Catherine?

24:10.392 --> 24:13.353
She's in Afghanistan, Deb.

24:13.355 --> 24:15.352
Why?

24:15.354 --> 24:16.856
We went over there together,

24:16.858 --> 24:18.792
<i>looking for</i>
<i>a little boy she knew</i>

24:18.794 --> 24:21.760
<i>from her time in the country;</i>
<i>his name is Najib.</i>

24:21.762 --> 24:23.864
<i>He'd been kidnapped</i>
<i>by the Taliban.</i>

24:23.866 --> 24:24.896
Catherine found him.

24:24.898 --> 24:27.632
He's okay, but...

24:27.634 --> 24:29.832
she's worried that
the Taliban will come back,

24:29.834 --> 24:32.503
so she decided to stay a while.

24:32.505 --> 24:34.407
Try to protect these kids
in the village.

24:34.409 --> 24:38.375
She's teaching at
a little school.

24:38.377 --> 24:42.815
Uh... she's making a life.

24:42.817 --> 24:45.583
So she's not
coming back?

24:49.219 --> 24:51.225
She said to me
I shouldn't wait for her,

24:51.227 --> 24:55.097
that she's found her place.

24:55.099 --> 24:57.561
Honey, I'm so sorry.

24:57.563 --> 24:59.361
Listen, we were supposed
to be talking about you.

24:59.363 --> 25:01.697
Me? Hey, I'm fine.

25:01.699 --> 25:03.465
I just need one thing.

25:03.467 --> 25:05.305
What's that?

25:05.307 --> 25:07.969
Someone to walk me
down the aisle.

25:11.780 --> 25:13.315
You know anybody?

25:13.317 --> 25:14.650
I do know someone.

25:16.516 --> 25:19.954
<i>Jake is telling the truth</i>

25:19.956 --> 25:22.122
when he says
he didn't kill his parents.

25:22.124 --> 25:24.026
Okay.

25:24.028 --> 25:26.194
Does he know anything
about the murder at all?

25:26.196 --> 25:27.730
Not according to the machine.

25:27.732 --> 25:29.259
I hope this means Jake is

25:29.261 --> 25:31.563
no longer a person of
interest, Detective.

25:31.565 --> 25:34.299
Let me put a wire on Travis,
then make my decision. Come on.

25:39.573 --> 25:41.446
Travis?
Hey.

25:41.448 --> 25:42.712
Travis?

25:42.714 --> 25:44.555
Does this go down to
the parking lot?

25:44.557 --> 25:45.620
Yeah.

25:45.622 --> 25:47.462
This action is in no way
an admission of guilt

25:47.464 --> 25:48.495
on the part of my client.

25:48.497 --> 25:51.330
You're the reason
I hate lawyers.

25:51.332 --> 25:52.371
Chin, you got him?

25:52.373 --> 25:53.571
We got him.

25:53.573 --> 25:55.036
You guys were right
about this kid.

25:55.038 --> 25:56.846
Travis slipped out
a couple of minutes ago

25:56.848 --> 25:58.383
and jumped into a cab.

25:58.385 --> 26:00.512
All right,
let me know where he lands.

26:10.063 --> 26:13.868
Okay, he just pulled into the
Aloha Motel on Beach Walk.

26:34.450 --> 26:35.887
Listen,

26:35.889 --> 26:39.317
I know you're scared, but
I can't cover for you anymore.

26:39.319 --> 26:41.284
What are we gonna do?

26:41.286 --> 26:42.523
Hands! Hands!

26:42.525 --> 26:43.787
Get 'em up!

26:43.789 --> 26:45.419
Turn around,
get on your knees.

26:45.421 --> 26:46.555
Put your hands
behind your head,

26:46.557 --> 26:48.523
interlock your
fingers, right now.

26:48.525 --> 26:49.459
Running out

26:49.461 --> 26:50.595
on us like
that, Travis.

26:50.597 --> 26:52.131
That wasn't nice.

26:52.965 --> 26:54.963
Look who we found.

26:54.965 --> 26:56.635
Come here.

27:11.818 --> 27:14.169
All right, so here's what
we think happened, Travis.

27:14.170 --> 27:15.812
You're young,
you're impressionable,

27:15.813 --> 27:17.307
you've been going
through a rough time.

27:17.309 --> 27:18.475
Patti's an older woman,

27:18.477 --> 27:20.411
she's a divorcée.
She's looking for someone

27:20.413 --> 27:22.051
to take care of her.

27:22.053 --> 27:23.483
Someone with money.

27:23.485 --> 27:24.915
Only, you don't have any.

27:24.917 --> 27:26.419
Not while your parents
are alive, right?

27:26.421 --> 27:29.258
So let me ask you.

27:29.260 --> 27:32.923
Did you come up with the plan
to kill them, or did she?

27:32.925 --> 27:34.194
That's not
what happened.

27:34.196 --> 27:35.458
Then why did you run?

27:35.460 --> 27:37.562
You hiding something?

27:42.700 --> 27:46.938
It was Patti and me who
took Tai's car last night.

27:48.076 --> 27:49.441
We lied to you.

27:49.443 --> 27:51.241
We just wanted
to be alone.

27:51.243 --> 27:53.345
- We needed to talk.
- In a motel?

27:53.347 --> 27:54.609
About what?

27:54.611 --> 27:57.049
He wanted to tell
his parents about us,

27:57.051 --> 27:58.985
but I said that
we couldn't.

27:58.987 --> 28:01.089
Not now.

28:01.091 --> 28:03.585
Maybe not ever.
Why not?

28:03.587 --> 28:07.057
Patti's ex wants full
custody of their daughter.

28:07.059 --> 28:09.561
If he found out
that Patti was sleeping with

28:09.563 --> 28:13.161
their son's best friend,
he would use it in court.

28:14.467 --> 28:15.969
No one could know.

28:15.971 --> 28:18.569
You knew you'd fail
the polygraph, so you ran.

28:22.779 --> 28:25.074
I love Patti.

28:25.076 --> 28:28.312
I wanted to protect her.

28:28.314 --> 28:31.075
But I wish I'd gone back
to the house last night

28:31.077 --> 28:32.377
and told my parents everything.

28:32.379 --> 28:34.608
I wish...

28:34.610 --> 28:38.016
we'd had the biggest
blowout fight of all time.

28:38.018 --> 28:40.816
Because if there were people in
the house, if there was yelling,

28:40.818 --> 28:43.952
then maybe the guy who killed
them wouldn't have ever come in.

28:45.722 --> 28:48.328
Maybe my folks would
still be alive.

29:02.073 --> 29:05.143
Kid seems genuinely broken up.

29:05.145 --> 29:06.439
Yeah, and
you got to admit,

29:06.441 --> 29:08.375
Mrs. Robinson does have
a valid reason why

29:08.377 --> 29:09.975
she and her boy toy
would lie to us.

29:09.977 --> 29:12.015
Trouble is, they still
don't have an alibi.

29:12.017 --> 29:13.319
Yeah, which means we can't
rule them out just yet.

29:13.321 --> 29:14.751
I think we can all agree

29:14.753 --> 29:17.119
that we like them less and
less for the two murders.

29:17.121 --> 29:18.751
All right, so where
do we go from here?

29:18.753 --> 29:21.126
You know, there is someone
we haven't considered.

29:21.128 --> 29:23.221
Goodman?

29:23.223 --> 29:24.557
What makes you think
he's involved?

29:24.559 --> 29:27.525
He's the executor
of the Kealoha estate.

29:27.527 --> 29:28.997
Which means he had
a strong financial motive

29:28.999 --> 29:30.702
for killing them.
How do you figure?

29:30.704 --> 29:31.670
Fees.

29:31.672 --> 29:33.838
That estate is worth
$20 million now.

29:33.840 --> 29:36.206
And as executor, Goodman's
entitled to a piece of that.

29:36.208 --> 29:37.270
That's right.

29:37.272 --> 29:38.839
Think about it.

29:38.841 --> 29:40.207
Put yourself in his shoes.

29:40.209 --> 29:42.815
The Kealohas used to
pay Goodman a big retainer.

29:42.817 --> 29:45.479
Now, if they go to prison,
that money is gone.

29:45.481 --> 29:47.080
But if they go to the morgue...

29:47.082 --> 29:48.752
Money just keeps
rolling in.

29:48.754 --> 29:50.888
We need to start getting
into this man's life.

29:52.026 --> 29:54.056
All right?
Yeah.

30:07.305 --> 30:08.640
Hey.

30:08.642 --> 30:09.672
Thanks for coming.

30:09.674 --> 30:11.240
Yeah, what can
I do for you?

30:11.242 --> 30:12.312
As soon as Deb told me

30:12.314 --> 30:15.047
what her nephew did
for a living,

30:15.049 --> 30:16.447
I figured we'd have some issues.

30:16.449 --> 30:20.014
I got no issue with you
being a lawyer, Leonard.

30:20.016 --> 30:21.086
You just don't like my client.

30:21.088 --> 30:23.254
I worked for
Gino Leone, yeah,

30:23.256 --> 30:26.221
but I felt like my real job

30:26.223 --> 30:28.053
was to keep the government
accountable.

30:28.055 --> 30:30.261
There were times
they overreached

30:30.263 --> 30:32.189
trying to put Gino behind bars.

30:32.191 --> 30:33.597
Yeah, because they
knew he was guilty.

30:33.599 --> 30:34.933
But if Gino Leone
doesn't have

30:34.935 --> 30:36.933
the same right to privacy

30:36.935 --> 30:39.701
and self-incrimination
as the rest of us,

30:39.703 --> 30:43.004
sooner or later, none of us
will have those rights.

30:43.006 --> 30:45.476
So I gave him my best defense.

30:45.478 --> 30:46.476
Apparently, you gave him

30:46.478 --> 30:47.940
a little more than
your best defense.

30:47.942 --> 30:49.780
The word is that you
helped him bury evidence.

30:49.782 --> 30:51.180
I checked you out.

30:51.182 --> 30:52.348
I knew you would.

30:52.350 --> 30:54.180
That's why I brought this.

30:58.757 --> 31:01.888
One morning, an envelope
was dropped at my office.

31:01.890 --> 31:03.383
Inside was a key

31:03.385 --> 31:07.050
to a locker in the Penn Station
and a note that read,

31:07.052 --> 31:09.521
“Destroy anything you find.”

31:09.523 --> 31:11.586
This box was
in the locker.

31:11.588 --> 31:12.890
What's in it?

31:12.892 --> 31:15.458
I don't know.

31:15.460 --> 31:17.994
If I had opened this box,
and there was evidence,

31:17.996 --> 31:20.034
morally I would have
been compelled

31:20.036 --> 31:21.834
to share it
with the prosecution.

31:21.836 --> 31:24.138
So I didn't open it.

31:24.140 --> 31:26.802
But I didn't destroy it either.

31:26.804 --> 31:29.473
I would never do that.

31:29.475 --> 31:32.577
What do you want me
to do with it?

31:32.579 --> 31:35.177
Do whatever you think is right.

31:35.179 --> 31:36.913
I ended my treatment

31:36.915 --> 31:38.848
the day before Deb and I
got on the boat.

31:38.850 --> 31:41.720
There's nothing more
they can do.

31:41.722 --> 31:44.288
I'm feeling pretty good
right now, but...

31:44.290 --> 31:48.560
in a month or so, I'm going to
take a turn for the worse.

31:48.562 --> 31:51.560
All I really want to do is
spend whatever time I have left

31:51.562 --> 31:55.864
making your aunt
the happiest woman in the world.

31:55.866 --> 31:57.968
We're getting
married tomorrow,

31:57.970 --> 32:00.168
but I know it wouldn't
feel right to her

32:00.170 --> 32:01.504
unless you were there.

32:01.506 --> 32:04.704
Appreciate
you hearing me out.

32:24.960 --> 32:26.997
I really want to know
what's in the box.

32:28.095 --> 32:30.902
If it's a murder weapon,

32:30.904 --> 32:33.366
I-I got to give it to the
New York D.A. right away.

32:33.368 --> 32:36.438
I mean, they're gonna
figure out where I got it.

32:36.440 --> 32:38.742
It's definitely gonna cut
Deb and Leonard's honeymoon

32:38.744 --> 32:39.805
a bit short.

32:39.807 --> 32:41.509
Right, now that...
that is trouble

32:41.511 --> 32:42.941
I did not go
looking for.

32:42.943 --> 32:44.413
That trouble was
dropped at my door.

32:44.415 --> 32:46.877
No, technic...
no, not technically.

32:46.879 --> 32:49.285
Specifically,
this trouble exists only

32:49.287 --> 32:51.421
because you went
looking for trouble

32:51.423 --> 32:53.853
by thinking Leonard was
a bad guy and looking into him.

32:53.855 --> 32:55.525
Quiet as kept.

32:57.559 --> 32:59.428
Ladies,
if you don't mind.

33:01.631 --> 33:05.468
So, Goodman's alibi
checks out.

33:05.470 --> 33:07.636
Okay. So maybe he didn't
pull the trigger.

33:07.638 --> 33:08.604
He could've
hired someone.

33:08.606 --> 33:10.436
I thought
about that, too.

33:10.438 --> 33:11.668
But we looked
through his financials;

33:11.670 --> 33:12.804
there's nothing
here that indicates

33:12.806 --> 33:14.140
a payout
to a hit man.

33:14.142 --> 33:14.876
Check you out.

33:14.878 --> 33:15.972
You're getting,
uh...

33:15.974 --> 33:17.780
the moves, right?
Yeah, yeah.

33:17.782 --> 33:19.180
That's old-school, baby.

33:19.182 --> 33:20.548
You looking at the Lincoln
Avenue air hockey champ.

33:20.550 --> 33:21.948
Is that right?
That's right.

33:21.950 --> 33:23.652
Look-look
at this, now.

33:23.654 --> 33:24.820
You look at
the paperwork,

33:24.822 --> 33:26.652
you don't see any
large withdrawals,

33:26.654 --> 33:28.788
there's no curious
wire transfers.

33:28.790 --> 33:30.092
All right, hold on.

33:30.094 --> 33:31.388
This guy's a lawyer,
he's smart, right?

33:31.390 --> 33:32.860
He's gonna cover
his tracks.

33:32.862 --> 33:34.828
He's not gonna take the money
out of his own account.

33:34.830 --> 33:36.764
All right, then.
From where?

33:36.766 --> 33:40.163
How about from
the Kealohas themselves?

33:40.165 --> 33:41.403
Turns out that Goodman's firm

33:41.405 --> 33:42.899
had access to
an old bank account

33:42.901 --> 33:45.067
in Kate Kealoha's
maiden name.

33:45.069 --> 33:46.874
It was before
it was seized

33:46.876 --> 33:48.506
by the SEC.

33:48.508 --> 33:50.378
Now, when
the investigation started,

33:50.380 --> 33:51.745
the Kealohas gave Goodman

33:51.747 --> 33:53.546
power of attorney
over all of their accounts,

33:53.548 --> 33:55.082
which of course
gave him the ability

33:55.084 --> 33:56.450
to authorize withdrawals.

33:56.452 --> 33:58.650
They must've really
trusted him.

33:58.652 --> 33:59.818
Mm-hmm.
Maybe a little too much,

33:59.820 --> 34:00.882
because when I looked through

34:00.884 --> 34:02.522
the recent transactions,

34:02.524 --> 34:04.922
I found a wire transfer
in the amount of $100,000

34:04.924 --> 34:06.226
to an off-shore account

34:06.228 --> 34:07.226
to this guy.

34:07.228 --> 34:09.592
Greg Barber.

34:09.594 --> 34:10.897
He's an old client of Goodman's

34:10.899 --> 34:12.193
with ties
to organized crime.

34:12.195 --> 34:14.266
Fits the profile
of a gun for hire.

34:14.268 --> 34:15.530
So Goodman used his own

34:15.532 --> 34:17.737
clients' money
to hire a hit man?

34:22.741 --> 34:24.379
Take cover!

34:56.501 --> 34:57.792
Cover me.

34:57.793 --> 34:58.634
Seriously?

34:58.658 --> 35:00.097
Hey, we're about
to run out of ammo.

35:00.098 --> 35:02.032
Then what?

35:02.034 --> 35:03.832
I prefer the
glass half-full

35:03.834 --> 35:06.736
scenario where
one of my shots hits him.

35:08.042 --> 35:09.105
Good luck with that.

35:09.107 --> 35:12.145
You'll get
used to it.

35:23.154 --> 35:24.984
Barber. Don't do it.

35:32.362 --> 35:34.567
All clear.

35:37.833 --> 35:39.199
HPD checked
Barber's car.

35:39.201 --> 35:41.567
We got no shotgun and no
hollow core slugs-- nothing.

35:41.569 --> 35:43.039
All right, we're
striking out in here, too.

35:43.041 --> 35:44.575
But I'm thinking he wouldn't
have been stupid enough

35:44.577 --> 35:45.943
to leave the murder weapon here.

35:45.945 --> 35:47.911
All right, look, we have got
to tie Barber directly

35:47.913 --> 35:50.215
to this murder or our 100K
theory is out the window.

35:50.217 --> 35:53.279
Hey, guys, I found
this on his laptop.

35:53.281 --> 35:54.847
All right, they're photos
of the Kealoha house.

35:54.849 --> 35:56.087
That's right.

35:56.089 --> 35:58.055
So he did some recon
beforehand-- so what?

35:58.057 --> 35:59.254
Yes, but he didn't take
these pictures.

35:59.256 --> 36:00.390
They were
e-mailed to him.

36:00.392 --> 36:02.958
Must've been
from Eugene Goodman.

36:02.960 --> 36:04.158
No, not
Goodman.

36:04.160 --> 36:06.158
These were taken
by Kate Kealoha.

36:06.160 --> 36:08.366
Our victim.

36:11.632 --> 36:13.301
You're telling us

36:13.303 --> 36:16.269
our mother hired someone
to kill her and our father?

36:17.975 --> 36:20.844
I don't understand.
Why would she do that?

36:22.446 --> 36:24.946
We think it's because she wanted
you and Jake to inherit

36:24.948 --> 36:27.144
the $20 million
in insurance money.

36:27.146 --> 36:28.943
Give you guys a fresh start.

36:36.952 --> 36:38.782
Fresh start? I...

36:38.784 --> 36:41.886
Travis...

36:41.888 --> 36:43.989
I know this is hard
to accept,

36:43.991 --> 36:44.957
but it's what happened.

36:44.959 --> 36:46.757
Your mother had access
to the account

36:46.759 --> 36:48.124
that Barber
was paid from.

36:48.126 --> 36:50.731
She e-mailed Barber
photographs of your house

36:50.733 --> 36:52.963
so he'd know how to get in.
We took a blood sample

36:52.965 --> 36:54.299
from your dog
and we found

36:54.301 --> 36:55.963
traces of your mother's
sleeping pill medication

36:55.965 --> 36:57.603
in your
dog's blood.

36:57.605 --> 37:00.306
She drugged Riley so he'd
sleep through the murders.

37:02.244 --> 37:04.440
I'm so sorry.

37:15.557 --> 37:18.189
That's why he was so
freaked out this morning.

37:21.834 --> 37:23.864
How could she think that
we would want the money

37:23.866 --> 37:25.832
more than having them here?

37:25.834 --> 37:28.039
They always cared too much
about the money.

37:28.041 --> 37:30.502
They didn't know how to see
what was important anymore.

37:30.504 --> 37:32.310
Boys, there's
something else

37:32.312 --> 37:34.511
you, uh,
you should know.

37:34.513 --> 37:37.711
Even though your mother
was so careful

37:37.713 --> 37:39.247
with the planning of all this,

37:39.249 --> 37:41.719
this insurance company may still
refuse to pay out on the policy.

37:41.721 --> 37:43.719
It's blood money.

37:43.721 --> 37:45.690
We would just give it away to
the people our father cheated.

37:45.692 --> 37:47.796
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey.

37:47.798 --> 37:49.303
The boys are upset,

37:49.305 --> 37:51.368
but the fact is
David Kealoha knew nothing

37:51.370 --> 37:53.338
of his wife's intent
to murder him.

37:53.340 --> 37:55.507
The direct beneficiaries, his
sons, not only did not know

37:55.509 --> 37:57.747
about the murder, they didn't
even know there was a policy

37:57.749 --> 37:59.715
in effect. There's
no conspiracy here.

37:59.717 --> 38:02.651
The insurance company
will lose this battle.

38:02.653 --> 38:04.115
Well, I-I don't
think your

38:04.117 --> 38:06.250
battle's gonna be with
the insurance company.

38:06.252 --> 38:08.258
I think it's gonna be
with these two boys.

38:08.260 --> 38:10.459
I think he's right.

38:10.461 --> 38:12.494
These boys have got
too much honor

38:12.496 --> 38:15.200
to take something
that's not rightfully theirs.

38:18.013 --> 38:21.614
Travis, I misjudged you.

38:21.616 --> 38:23.782
I'm really sorry about that.

38:23.784 --> 38:26.253
And we're both
deeply sorry

38:26.255 --> 38:29.052
for your loss, both of you.

38:57.404 --> 38:58.874
So...

38:58.876 --> 39:00.809
what are you gonna
do with that thing?

39:03.179 --> 39:04.441
You know what?

39:04.443 --> 39:06.344
I think I'm gonna
put it in a locker

39:06.346 --> 39:08.344
for a couple of months and...

39:08.346 --> 39:09.616
accidentally forget about it

39:09.618 --> 39:11.952
and then I'm gonna give
it to the New York D.A.

39:11.954 --> 39:14.552
Ah. That's very nice, I think.

39:14.554 --> 39:16.424
You know, Leonard never
has to deal with it.

39:16.426 --> 39:18.456
You know what,
man, you were right.

39:18.458 --> 39:20.392
My aunt deserves to be happy.

39:20.394 --> 39:23.296
She does.

39:24.762 --> 39:26.368
Come on, now, we gonna
do this thing or what?

39:26.370 --> 39:28.968
I got on my monkey suit, man,
I'm ready to party, baby.

39:28.970 --> 39:31.090
I'm going, you see, I'm putting
on my shoes. Let's go.

39:32.242 --> 39:33.808
Here's the thing--

39:33.810 --> 39:35.944
No, I'm never gonna know what's
in Leonard Cassano's heart.

39:35.946 --> 39:38.439
But he loves my aunt and my
aunt loves him, all right?

39:38.441 --> 39:39.775
That's got to be
good enough for me.

39:39.777 --> 39:40.743
Yes, we're gonna do this.

39:40.745 --> 39:42.383
All right? You
look great.

39:42.385 --> 39:43.583
You know what you are?
You're like

39:43.585 --> 39:45.447
a big marshmallow filled
with testosterone.

39:45.449 --> 39:47.455
You'd have done the exact same thing.
I would have done the same

39:47.457 --> 39:49.487
thing-- that is because
I am known for my warmth.

39:49.489 --> 39:51.222
Oh, yeah, really?
What am I known for?

39:51.224 --> 39:52.726
You? You're known
for, uh, you know,

39:52.728 --> 39:54.326
bad driving and being cheap.
You know what? Uh, uh...

39:54.328 --> 39:55.990
Bad driving...
...better not be all this

39:55.992 --> 39:57.359
fighting all the way
to the thing, man,

39:57.361 --> 39:58.495
'cause I can't handle it.

39:58.497 --> 40:00.695
Don't make me give
you two a time out.

40:28.330 --> 40:30.264
Everybody, please rise.

40:35.403 --> 40:38.105
This is your last chance
to make a run for it.

40:38.107 --> 40:40.307
No way.

41:00.973 --> 41:04.475
Please be seated
so we can start the show.

41:04.477 --> 41:06.779
He's got the authority
to do this?

41:06.781 --> 41:08.033
You can get anything
on the Internet.

41:08.057 --> 41:08.612
Ah.

41:08.613 --> 41:09.851
Ladies and
gentlemen,

41:09.853 --> 41:11.346
we're gathered
here today

41:11.348 --> 41:12.985
to witness
the marriage

41:12.987 --> 41:15.150
of Deb and Leonard.

41:15.152 --> 41:17.148
A couple of months
ago they were just

41:17.150 --> 41:18.451
strangers in the night,

41:18.453 --> 41:20.250
but now they know
their love is

41:20.252 --> 41:21.416
here to stay.

41:21.418 --> 41:22.952
And they're
gonna be together

41:22.954 --> 41:24.584
come rain or come shine,

41:24.586 --> 41:27.119
because for Deb and Leonard  truly...
Your boy Sinatra needs some new material.

41:27.121 --> 41:28.591
Yeah, tell me about it.

41:28.593 --> 41:31.023
...the best is yet to come.

41:31.897 --> 41:32.959
Who here presents

41:32.961 --> 41:35.359
this lovely bride to be

41:35.361 --> 41:36.759
married
to this man?

41:40.401 --> 41:41.969
I do.

41:41.971 --> 41:43.202
Thank you.

41:43.204 --> 41:45.737
Before we start
with the vow-taking,

41:45.739 --> 41:47.438
the bride and groom
would like

41:47.440 --> 41:48.805
to say a few words

41:48.807 --> 41:49.972
to each other.

41:49.974 --> 41:51.203
Leonard?

41:54.075 --> 41:55.512
My beautiful Deb.

41:55.514 --> 41:57.841
I can't believe
that a diagnosis

41:57.843 --> 42:00.886
of stage IV cancer could make me
the happiest man in the world,

42:00.888 --> 42:03.857
but it's... it's true.

42:03.859 --> 42:07.196
You held my hand
through chemo,

42:07.198 --> 42:09.734
but you were
my real treatment.

42:09.736 --> 42:12.205
I can't even
remember my life

42:12.207 --> 42:13.803
before you came
along and changed

42:13.805 --> 42:15.243
everything.

42:15.245 --> 42:17.338
You are my angel,

42:17.340 --> 42:20.344
my one in a million...
and all I want is

42:20.346 --> 42:22.040
to be your husband.

42:22.042 --> 42:27.184
To cherish every moment
we have together.

42:27.186 --> 42:29.016
I love you.

42:29.018 --> 42:31.120
I love you.

42:31.122 --> 42:32.288
I don't have

42:32.290 --> 42:33.624
a way with words the way

42:33.626 --> 42:34.856
my darling Leonard has,

42:34.858 --> 42:36.024
so, uh,

42:36.026 --> 42:37.825
I've chosen to rely

42:37.827 --> 42:39.993
