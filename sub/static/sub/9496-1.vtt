01:33.910 --> 01:35.537
All clear.

02:15.985 --> 02:17.748
Shh.

02:17.921 --> 02:19.320
Ali.

03:37.700 --> 03:41.007
<i>Do we belong there?
Do we not?</i>

03:41.437 --> 03:43.530
<i>It doesn't matter</i>
<i>how you would answer that...</i>

03:43.706 --> 03:48.040
<i>... because we are there.</i>
<i>We're tired, and we can't see the end.</i>

03:48.645 --> 03:52.877
<i>We can't even console ourselves</i>
<i>that our enemy is just as tired as we are.</i>

03:53.683 --> 03:55.173
<i>Because they're not.</i>

03:58.187 --> 04:04.092
<i>It is a fallacy that prolonged war</i>
<i>will weaken an occupied enemy.</i>

04:04.260 --> 04:05.284
He's dead.

04:05.461 --> 04:08.794
<i>It most likely</i>
<i>will make your enemy stronger.</i>

04:08.965 --> 04:12.526
<i>They get used to the deprivation,</i>
<i>and they adapt and respond accordingly.</i>

04:14.237 --> 04:15.932
While here at home...

04:16.105 --> 04:20.507
<i>The explosion occurred in one of</i>
<i>Manchester's heavily Asian neighborhoods.</i>

04:20.677 --> 04:22.269
...with every death reported...

04:22.445 --> 04:26.745
...we have to deal with a public-opinion
trajectory that slides rapidly...

04:26.916 --> 04:30.750
...from supportive to negative
to downright hostile.

04:31.387 --> 04:35.448
People just get sick and tired
of a moment's silence at a ball game.

04:36.225 --> 04:38.284
They just wanna be told that it's over.

04:38.461 --> 04:40.929
<i>Police and emergency</i>
<i>workers in Manchester...</i>

04:41.097 --> 04:43.964
<i>... are still combing through what is left</i>
<i>of this block of flats.</i>

04:44.133 --> 04:45.725
<i>They say this was not the target.</i>

04:45.902 --> 04:49.531
<i>Had the bombs being constructed here</i>
<i>found their eventual intended target...</i>

04:49.706 --> 04:50.900
<i>... the devastation could...</i>

04:51.074 --> 04:52.735
Despite the fact...

04:52.909 --> 04:55.935
...we have markedly increased
our operational intensity...

04:56.713 --> 04:58.613
...we're not seeing any progress.

04:59.682 --> 05:01.616
What we're dealing with here...

05:01.784 --> 05:05.015
...is potentially a global conflagration...

05:05.188 --> 05:08.988
...that requires constant diligence
in order to suppress.

05:10.460 --> 05:12.451
Now, you see...

05:12.996 --> 05:16.022
...because our enemy...

05:16.199 --> 05:21.193
...has realized that they are fighting guys
from the future.

05:22.071 --> 05:26.735
Now, ahem, it is brilliant
as it is infuriating.

05:26.909 --> 05:31.369
If you live like it's the past,
and you behave like it's the past...

05:31.547 --> 05:34.880
...then guys from the future
find it very hard to see you.

05:35.051 --> 05:38.578
If you throw away your cell phone,
shut down your e-mail...

05:38.755 --> 05:42.816
<i>... pass all your instructions face-to-face,</i>
<i>hand-to-hand...</i>

05:42.992 --> 05:46.257
<i>... turn your back on technology</i>
<i>and just disappear into the crowd...</i>

05:46.429 --> 05:49.262
<i>No flags. No uniforms.</i>

05:50.366 --> 05:52.561
<i>You got your basic grunts</i>
<i>on the ground there.</i>

05:52.735 --> 05:55.067
<i>They're looking going,</i>
<i>"Who is it we're fighting?"</i>

05:55.238 --> 05:59.868
<i>In a situation like this,</i>
<i>your friends dress just like your enemies...</i>

06:00.043 --> 06:02.534
<i>... and your enemies dress</i>
<i>like your friends.</i>

06:03.112 --> 06:07.913
What I need you to fully understand is that
these people, they do not wanna negotiate.

06:08.084 --> 06:09.574
Not at all.

06:09.752 --> 06:13.984
<i>They want the universal caliphate</i>
<i>established across the face of the Earth...</i>

06:15.324 --> 06:19.727
<i>... and they want every infidel converted</i>
<i>or dead.</i>

06:22.565 --> 06:24.760
So, what's changed...

06:25.101 --> 06:28.537
...is that our
allegedly unsophisticated enemy...

06:28.704 --> 06:32.037
...has cottoned on
to the factually unsophisticated truth...

06:32.208 --> 06:33.539
...we're an easy target.

06:33.709 --> 06:36.439
<i>We are an easy target...</i>

06:36.612 --> 06:40.139
<i>... and our world as we know it</i>
<i>is a lot simpler...</i>

06:40.316 --> 06:43.410
...to put to an end than you might think.

06:44.253 --> 06:47.654
We take our foot off the throat
of this enemy for one minute...

06:47.824 --> 06:50.088
...and our world changes completely.

06:50.259 --> 06:52.124
Thank you, Mr. Hoffman.

07:04.373 --> 07:05.635
BASSAM

07:06.242 --> 07:07.903
I'm coming.

07:14.517 --> 07:16.144
You're early.

07:17.153 --> 07:18.620
Big boss man, what's happening?

07:21.390 --> 07:23.085
What's the story?

07:23.259 --> 07:24.556
Rules of the day.

07:24.727 --> 07:26.991
If the car gets immobilized,
start shooting.

07:27.163 --> 07:29.324
Nobody gets traded. Everybody dies.

07:29.499 --> 07:31.262
So same as every day?

07:31.434 --> 07:34.267
- You got it. Want some breakfast?
- Hell, yes.

07:35.271 --> 07:36.295
Thanks.

07:37.673 --> 07:39.038
All right. Tell me something real.

07:39.675 --> 07:41.905
<i>Oh, all I got is real, man. You know me.</i>

07:42.078 --> 07:43.306
All right, let's hear it.

07:43.479 --> 07:47.074
All right, a guy named Nizar.

07:47.250 --> 07:49.445
He's from Aquiz up near Tikrit, right?

07:49.619 --> 07:53.077
So he gets all fucked in his head
after the invasion, you know?

07:53.256 --> 07:55.884
He starts working with the Baathists,
then the jihadists.

07:56.058 --> 07:59.186
But he is scared shitless now, man.

07:59.362 --> 08:01.762
He's supposed
to do a martyrdom operation...

08:01.931 --> 08:03.990
...but he doesn't wanna fucking die.

08:04.167 --> 08:06.294
So he's coming to us.

08:06.469 --> 08:07.834
- He's coming to us?
- Mm-hm.

08:09.338 --> 08:10.965
For chrissakes, move the donkey.

08:13.009 --> 08:15.842
Move it, let's go.
Get these guys moving. Let's go.

08:16.012 --> 08:18.344
Come on, come on.

08:18.514 --> 08:21.244
Oh, my God. Just get the...
Buy the fucking flowers.

08:23.719 --> 08:25.619
Come on, come on.

08:25.788 --> 08:28.552
So, what are the chances
your man's playing both sides?

08:28.724 --> 08:30.851
I don't know. What are they with me?

08:31.027 --> 08:32.995
Three to one.

08:33.162 --> 08:34.527
All right. Let's slow down.

08:34.697 --> 08:36.164
Is this it?

08:36.332 --> 08:39.460
Yeah. This is it.

08:39.635 --> 08:42.695
Nitrate 37 slewing to target ports now.

08:42.871 --> 08:44.396
01 L2MDT.

08:44.574 --> 08:46.701
On target, 15:31 Zulu.

08:46.876 --> 08:48.810
Cell phone linked to moving vehicle.

08:48.978 --> 08:50.639
<i>Stop right up here.</i>

08:50.813 --> 08:54.112
Right up here. Let me take a look.

08:57.320 --> 08:59.948
- I don't see anything.
- I'm gonna call him.

09:00.122 --> 09:01.987
All right, call him.

09:06.596 --> 09:07.620
<i>Bassam.</i>

09:07.797 --> 09:09.424
Yeah, Nizar.

09:12.935 --> 09:13.959
NIZAR:

09:14.136 --> 09:15.296
Huh?

09:15.471 --> 09:17.166
NIZAR:

09:17.340 --> 09:18.500
IR 3.9.

09:18.674 --> 09:22.201
- He says he wants one of us to come in.
- He is to meet inside the car.

09:22.378 --> 09:24.869
Inside the car.
If he wants to talk, it's in the car.

09:25.047 --> 09:27.743
You have to come to us, Nizar.

09:27.917 --> 09:30.511
- I'm coming to you.
- Do the fuck what I said. Go.

09:31.621 --> 09:33.452
Hey, hey. Listen to me.

09:33.623 --> 09:35.887
I am not getting my head cut off
on the Internet.

09:36.058 --> 09:37.525
If something happens, shoot me.

09:37.693 --> 09:40.856
- Will you shoot me?
- Fuck that shit. I will shoot you right now.

09:41.030 --> 09:43.225
- I'm not kidding.
- Quit being a pussy.

09:47.403 --> 09:48.597
Nizar.

09:50.906 --> 09:52.498
Zooming in.

09:52.675 --> 09:54.233
Visual confirmed.

09:54.944 --> 09:56.844
Long wave 10.7.

10:06.188 --> 10:07.382
Shit.

10:07.556 --> 10:10.525
- I can't talk right now, Larry.
- She wants the house.

10:10.693 --> 10:13.287
<i>Give her the house.</i>
<i>It's a piece of shit, all right?</i>

10:13.462 --> 10:15.623
- We're getting this, sir.
- We're getting it.

10:15.798 --> 10:18.596
She can ask for whatever she wants,
but I'm not listening.

10:18.768 --> 10:21.259
<i>What the hell are you calling for?</i>
<i>Hang up the phone.</i>

10:21.437 --> 10:22.904
Hang up the phone.

10:24.974 --> 10:26.464
Are you on the line?

10:26.642 --> 10:29.338
I can see you now, all right?
You are attracting attention.

10:29.512 --> 10:32.879
Get the fuck out of here right now.
I will handle this on my own.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.277
Roger that. Off target.

10:35.117 --> 10:37.677
Copy. Off target, 3-10.

10:42.525 --> 10:43.719
FERRIS

10:44.393 --> 10:45.519
Yes.

10:45.695 --> 10:47.094
Good, good, good.

10:50.166 --> 10:53.465
You want an orange? You hungry?

10:53.636 --> 10:54.762
No.

10:58.341 --> 11:00.775
So, Nizar...

11:00.943 --> 11:02.740
...why'd you come to me, huh?

11:03.312 --> 11:05.280
I know too many things.

11:06.782 --> 11:09.376
They prepared me to go outside Iraq.

11:10.686 --> 11:13.416
What do you mean by "outside Iraq"?

11:13.589 --> 11:16.956
They said they need me
to become shahid...

11:17.126 --> 11:19.151
...for martyrdom.

11:19.328 --> 11:22.786
When a man knows too much,
they say martyrdom.

11:22.965 --> 11:26.765
Who do you mean by "they," Nizar? Hm?

11:32.541 --> 11:34.736
I don't want to die.

11:36.912 --> 11:39.142
I want to go to America.

11:39.949 --> 11:42.144
I have a Ph.D., you know?

11:42.318 --> 11:45.185
And they want me...
They want me to blow myself up.

11:45.688 --> 11:48.486
- Ph.D. in what, chemistry?
- No.

11:48.657 --> 11:50.818
What do you know
about radiological materials?

11:50.993 --> 11:54.087
Linguistic. I speak five languages.
Five, you know?

11:54.263 --> 11:56.390
Nobody should say "martyr" to me.
Nobody.

11:56.565 --> 11:59.159
- You are a rare and a delicate flower.
- Yes, I am.

11:59.335 --> 12:00.359
- Yes.
- Yes.

12:00.536 --> 12:03.369
So you don't wanna kill the Jews
and the Crusaders, huh?

12:04.940 --> 12:06.737
What do you know about our pain?

12:07.810 --> 12:09.368
Cut the bullshit, all right?

12:09.545 --> 12:11.638
Give me some information.
What do you know?

12:17.253 --> 12:20.381
You know,
I know enough to be martyred.

12:20.556 --> 12:23.855
But with you,
I know enough to stay alive.

12:29.698 --> 12:31.723
You have a computer?

12:49.418 --> 12:51.443
- Yup.
<i>- Hey, Ed, it's me.</i>

12:51.620 --> 12:54.418
I got an Iraqi walk-in, up near Samarra.

12:54.590 --> 12:58.287
He's got a communiqué video here that
somebody walked across the Iranian border.

12:58.461 --> 13:00.292
I'm watching it right now, sir.

13:00.930 --> 13:03.023
- Can you see his face?
- <i>Yes, captain.</i>

13:03.199 --> 13:05.133
<i>I am looking at the white whale.</i>

13:05.601 --> 13:07.933
- It is Al-Saleem.
- <i>What's he saying?</i>

13:08.103 --> 13:09.365
<i>Well, it's gotta be current.</i>

13:09.538 --> 13:11.802
He mentions the Sheffield bus bombings
a week ago.

13:11.974 --> 13:15.671
He's telling the brothers to prepare for
a UK operation's already planned...

13:15.845 --> 13:19.372
...which is the bombing these people
fucked up in Manchester this morning.

13:19.815 --> 13:22.443
<i>Let me translate this part</i>
<i>for you directly.</i>

13:25.488 --> 13:29.515
"We will avenge the America wars
on the Muslim world.

13:31.327 --> 13:33.659
We will come at them everywhere.

13:34.296 --> 13:39.233
<i>We will strike at random, across Europe,</i>
<i>then America, continually.</i>

13:39.401 --> 13:41.266
We have bled.

13:41.437 --> 13:45.237
Now they will bleed. And bleed.

13:45.841 --> 13:47.741
Until they are bled out."

13:50.012 --> 13:51.479
Ed.

13:51.647 --> 13:54.241
It's 6:00 in the morning.

13:54.416 --> 13:56.145
Saving civilization, honey.

13:56.318 --> 13:58.115
<i>Disks are passed from hand to hand.</i>

13:58.287 --> 14:00.847
The communiqués are not transmitted,
not copied.

14:01.023 --> 14:04.481
My man says that real orders
are verbal or in code on paper.

14:04.660 --> 14:06.787
Is there any indication of where he is?

14:06.962 --> 14:10.420
No, sir.
He definitely does not have his location.

14:10.900 --> 14:13.960
But he did mention there's a safe house
up north, near Balad...

14:14.136 --> 14:15.728
<i>... where Al-Saleem may have been.</i>

14:15.905 --> 14:17.532
Dad?

14:17.706 --> 14:19.037
Hey.

14:19.208 --> 14:22.177
They're killing anyone who knows anything.
He's scared.

14:22.344 --> 14:24.812
<i>We need to debrief him very carefully.</i>

14:24.980 --> 14:27.448
- All right, so do it.
- <i>In the States.</i>

14:27.616 --> 14:28.947
No. Ahem.

14:29.118 --> 14:31.643
They're onto him.
That's the reason he's running.

14:31.820 --> 14:34.152
- On the toilet, not the floor.
- <i>You hear me, right?</i>

14:34.323 --> 14:36.814
So he wants to come to America
in one piece...

14:36.992 --> 14:39.187
...instead of going to paradise
in a thousand.

14:39.361 --> 14:41.158
He should've thought of that before.

14:41.330 --> 14:44.857
I'm telling you.
They will kill him within a few days, Ed.

14:45.034 --> 14:47.594
Yep. And if they do, that's all right...

14:47.770 --> 14:50.330
...because we can be there
to see who pulls the trigger.

14:50.506 --> 14:52.804
Now, get back to bed. Good night.

14:52.975 --> 14:56.638
- Am I missing the point?
- I just offered him asylum.

14:56.812 --> 14:58.473
<i>Well, you lied, buddy.</i>

14:59.281 --> 15:02.512
So just cut him loose...

15:02.685 --> 15:04.983
<i>... and put him back on the street.</i>

15:05.688 --> 15:06.712
All right.

15:15.064 --> 15:17.897
Okay, so everything's fine.
No, no, no problem. No problem.

15:18.067 --> 15:22.163
We just have to ask you a few more
questions, and then we can go.

15:22.338 --> 15:24.602
No, no more questions.
Take me to the Green Zone.

15:24.773 --> 15:28.106
Maybe we could help. We have
a few questions. Everything will be fine.

15:28.277 --> 15:31.303
Trust me. Okay? It's okay. Sit down.

15:33.248 --> 15:35.739
You're a liar. You're a liar. You fucking d...

15:35.918 --> 15:38.580
Get on the fucking... Back the fuck up!
Step back!

15:38.754 --> 15:41.689
I talk to you! I talk to you!
And that's all you want!

15:41.857 --> 15:45.349
- You want to see who kills me, huh?
- Bassam. Search him. Get his phone.

15:46.795 --> 15:49.525
Now you've seen our faces.
You know what that means.

15:49.698 --> 15:50.722
Computer.

15:50.899 --> 15:53.333
Guantanamo?
You threaten me with Guantanamo?

15:53.502 --> 15:55.470
If you don't do exactly what I say...

15:55.638 --> 15:58.038
...I will execute you right here.
Do you understand?

15:59.074 --> 16:03.010
Listen, we are your friends, okay?
We're your friends.

16:03.178 --> 16:05.703
We're here to watch you.
We're here to protect you.

16:06.248 --> 16:08.045
You can't even protect yourselves.

16:18.827 --> 16:20.954
<i>Boss?</i>
<i>- Yeah, I'm right here.</i>

16:21.130 --> 16:22.791
<i>I got a visual on him.</i>

16:22.965 --> 16:25.024
<i>Okay, where's he coming from?</i>

16:25.200 --> 16:27.259
He's riding up right now.
Coming right to us.

16:27.436 --> 16:29.461
<i>Yes. I see him. I see him.</i>

16:29.638 --> 16:32.664
He's coming down the street.
He's coming north towards the square.

16:32.841 --> 16:36.140
- I'm gonna hang back.
- <i>All right, I'll let you know what he's doing.</i>

16:36.311 --> 16:39.246
Keep an eye on him for me.
- He stopped in front of the café.

16:39.415 --> 16:41.110
He's walking right up.

16:42.985 --> 16:45.010
- <i>Listen, Bassam?</i>
- Yeah?

16:45.187 --> 16:51.217
There is a black van heading this way
with some pretty dangerous-looking guys.

16:51.393 --> 16:54.954
- <i>They're staring right at him.</i>
- Yeah, I see it.

16:55.130 --> 16:57.496
<i>Tell me what it does.</i>
<i>- All right.</i>

16:57.666 --> 17:01.568
Looks like it's parking right up ahead.
Yeah, it stopped. The van stopped.

17:01.737 --> 17:02.931
<i>Can I turn around?</i>

17:03.105 --> 17:05.300
Yeah, yeah, Nizar's getting on his bike.

17:05.473 --> 17:08.136
<i>There's like four or five guys</i>
<i>getting out of that van.</i>

17:08.310 --> 17:11.768
<i>Can you identify any of these guys?</i>
- I've never seen these guys before.

17:11.946 --> 17:12.971
We gotta move.

17:32.134 --> 17:33.658
Did you see a flash?
- What?

17:34.136 --> 17:35.467
Did somebody get hit?

17:35.637 --> 17:38.299
Let's see a playback on that.
- Stay with him.

17:40.175 --> 17:43.406
Hello.
- In case you didn't see it, I executed him.

17:43.579 --> 17:44.841
<i>You did what you had to do.</i>

17:45.013 --> 17:49.177
If you hadn't, he would be describing you
down to your eyebrows to them right now.

17:49.351 --> 17:51.649
I did it, all right? It's done. I killed him.

17:51.820 --> 17:54.254
<i>He was always gonna get killed</i>
<i>no matter what he did.</i>

17:54.423 --> 17:56.857
Besides, you'd milked him and he was dry.

17:57.025 --> 17:58.788
Excuse me.

17:59.762 --> 18:01.127
<i>Ferris?</i>

18:01.296 --> 18:03.196
Is your silence supposed
to say something?

18:03.365 --> 18:05.629
Because you do know we're at war, right?

18:05.801 --> 18:09.760
Your friend, who you must have had some
intense cross-cultural eye contact with...

18:09.938 --> 18:12.907
...was a terrorist a-hole,
who turned out to be a coward...

18:13.075 --> 18:14.736
...who wanted to go to Disneyland.

18:14.910 --> 18:18.209
Listen, Ed, we're going north now,
do you hear me?

18:18.380 --> 18:22.180
- <i>We're going north to the Balad safe house.</i>
- No, no, no, buddy. No, you're not.

18:22.351 --> 18:24.046
You're blown. There's chatter.

18:24.219 --> 18:27.347
Well, if I'm blown, Ed, that means
you should've sent a team here...

18:27.523 --> 18:31.584
...the minute Nizar got shot,
but you didn't send a team, did you?

18:31.760 --> 18:33.955
Well, not since we've been talking, Ferris.

18:34.129 --> 18:37.189
You and I, we're going to that safe house,
you understand? Now.

18:37.366 --> 18:39.129
- <i>Ferris?</i>
- Where's the goddamn car, huh?

18:39.301 --> 18:40.325
Let's get out of here.

19:10.732 --> 19:13.826
It's time to move.
I'm coming back to you, all right?

19:16.572 --> 19:18.767
If something happens,
you'll shoot me, right?

19:18.941 --> 19:21.273
- Yep.
- Good.

20:06.722 --> 20:08.212
Got you.

20:08.390 --> 20:09.948
Don't you fucking do it.

20:11.627 --> 20:13.151
Hassan! Hassan!

20:22.871 --> 20:27.831
Urgent request you dispatch Chili, Speck
or Nitrate to these coordinates.

20:36.485 --> 20:39.921
North, 34 degrees, 20 minutes,
16.8 seconds.

20:40.088 --> 20:43.421
<i>East, 44 degrees, 24 minutes,</i>
<i>14.4 seconds.</i>

20:43.592 --> 20:47.323
This is a live target, a known
operational base of an Al-Saleem cell.

20:47.496 --> 20:50.056
- A high-value target.
- Copy that, on approach.

21:13.221 --> 21:15.416
Aah! Get back!

21:25.901 --> 21:27.801
Come on!

21:27.970 --> 21:30.905
- Gotta go! Gotta go!
- I'm getting the intel!

21:32.240 --> 21:36.768
Get in the fucking car, man!
Come on! Come on!

21:42.384 --> 21:44.011
Go! Go!

21:53.362 --> 21:56.263
I've got guys coming down
the hill! Two trucks! On the right!

21:56.431 --> 21:58.023
I got it.

21:58.834 --> 21:59.892
Keep moving!

22:25.127 --> 22:26.151
Fuck.

22:26.328 --> 22:29.058
We're in some serious
fucking trouble here.

22:29.231 --> 22:32.826
We're on Highway 1, south of Samarra.
We're being pursued by two vehicles.

22:33.001 --> 22:35.697
<i>We have valuable intel in our possession!</i>

22:35.871 --> 22:38.704
We're in a black Nissan.
Where the fuck are you people?

22:38.874 --> 22:41.365
- I see them!
<i>- We're right on their six.</i>

22:44.179 --> 22:46.875
- <i>Have visual, will engage.</i>
- Copy that. Engage at will.

22:59.828 --> 23:01.853
RPG. Take them out now.

23:07.869 --> 23:09.336
<i>Fire!</i>

23:09.504 --> 23:10.971
RPG!

23:14.643 --> 23:16.304
<i>Nine, one, two, six, one.</i>

23:23.485 --> 23:25.248
Let's go!

23:27.022 --> 23:29.752
- Fuel tank is ruptured!
- I got him! Get the driver out!

23:29.925 --> 23:33.019
I can't! He's in pieces!
- Then get the bag! Get the intel!

23:34.096 --> 23:35.529
Bassam! Bassam!

23:36.198 --> 23:39.167
Stay with them. We are tracking.

23:40.569 --> 23:42.434
- Bassam!
Get his legs!

23:43.271 --> 23:46.331
No!
- Intel secure!

23:46.508 --> 23:48.271
Let's go! Stay down.

23:49.244 --> 23:50.506
Come on, buddy.

23:51.079 --> 23:53.047
Come on. Get him out, now!

24:08.263 --> 24:10.026
<i>He's dead.</i>

24:14.402 --> 24:15.801
Who are you?

24:15.971 --> 24:17.097
What's your name?

24:17.272 --> 24:20.207
Do you know where you are? Come on!

24:21.042 --> 24:22.634
Fuck.

24:37.092 --> 24:38.582
What's that?

24:38.760 --> 24:40.284
Bone fragments.

24:40.729 --> 24:42.390
Not yours.

24:49.004 --> 24:52.462
- They get that stuff I sent out?
- All uploaded to Langley.

24:52.641 --> 24:54.370
Mr. Hoffman.

24:56.478 --> 24:58.878
- Hey, Ed.
<i>- Ferris.</i>

24:59.047 --> 25:03.040
- <i>Christmas came early, buddy.</i>
- Oh, yeah? What'd I get for Christmas, Ed?

25:03.218 --> 25:07.154
Well, 15 pages of this, 40 pages of that.

25:07.322 --> 25:11.816
I got, like, about 712 phone numbers
that are new to us...

25:11.993 --> 25:13.824
...that we can strip and evaluate...

25:13.995 --> 25:17.089
...and amongst other things,
a safe house in Amman.

25:17.265 --> 25:19.733
I've got jihadists coming and going
from this place...

25:19.901 --> 25:21.869
...like it's happy hour at the Cat House.

25:22.504 --> 25:23.664
You gotta see this place.

25:24.306 --> 25:28.504
Before we get into that, I wanna know
what you're doing for Bassam's family, Ed.

25:28.677 --> 25:30.167
I didn't know the man.

25:30.345 --> 25:32.905
What are you doing for Bassam's family?
He was your guy.

25:33.081 --> 25:34.605
<i>So now you don't know him, huh?</i>

25:35.984 --> 25:39.613
<i>You'll be going to Amman</i>
<i>as acting station chief.</i>

25:39.788 --> 25:43.053
You'll outrank Holiday. No matter
what he says, you're the show-runner.

25:43.225 --> 25:47.457
<i>You'll liaise with Jordanian GID,</i>
<i>who are as hot for Al-Saleem as we are.</i>

25:47.629 --> 25:49.893
You'll be working with
a guy named Hani Salaam...

25:50.065 --> 25:52.590
...who is not your run-of-the-mill
fingernail-puller.

25:52.767 --> 25:54.166
Hani is a professional.

25:54.336 --> 25:56.327
And will I be sharing information
with him?

25:56.504 --> 25:59.371
<i>Let me say this about that: No.</i>

26:00.141 --> 26:03.269
Now, you wanna take a few weeks off
and go bang the wife?

26:03.445 --> 26:07.142
I'm getting a divorce, Ed. You know that.
You know more about it than I do.

26:07.315 --> 26:10.375
<i>Everybody around here screws up</i>
<i>their marriage, buddy. Why not you?</i>

26:11.453 --> 26:12.647
So you'll go to Amman?

26:15.991 --> 26:19.085
I will go to Amman. I'll call you later.

26:58.767 --> 27:02.703
This car is a real pile of shit.
Is this the best they could afford?

27:02.871 --> 27:06.432
I brought this car in case you wanted
to cruise the safe house now, you know?

27:06.608 --> 27:10.009
No one cruises that safe house, all right?

27:10.178 --> 27:13.341
I need to take a shit, I need a shower
and an Internet connection...

27:13.515 --> 27:16.211
...so just take me to my apartment,
all right?

27:17.152 --> 27:19.586
Got you in a high-rise.

27:19.754 --> 27:22.552
Hot and cold water. And you can drink it.

27:22.724 --> 27:24.453
- Great.
- There's not much local color.

27:25.026 --> 27:27.392
I've had it with the local color.
Thank you.

27:43.511 --> 27:45.672
Cheap-ass motherfuckers.

27:51.086 --> 27:52.917
Morning, sir.

27:53.588 --> 27:54.680
He's clear.

27:57.292 --> 27:59.692
NSA is listening to the phones
and computer links...

27:59.861 --> 28:01.692
...of anyone who's been near the house.

28:01.863 --> 28:05.629
Look, they don't have to be geniuses
to stop using their e-mail and cell phones.

28:05.800 --> 28:08.064
I don't understand why
you haven't figured out...

28:08.236 --> 28:11.069
...that they're not communicating
electronically anymore.

28:12.273 --> 28:14.673
The house is owned
by a family named Alousi.

28:14.843 --> 28:18.176
And in my opinion, it just seems
like a normal Jordanian family...

28:18.346 --> 28:20.041
...with a lot of country relatives.

28:20.215 --> 28:21.580
Normal Jordanian family.

28:21.750 --> 28:27.746
But all of them are unmarried males
between the ages of 18 and 35, correct?

28:27.922 --> 28:30.322
Listen, kid,
whatever information you got in Iraq...

28:30.492 --> 28:33.552
...I just don't think this house
is what you think it is.

28:33.728 --> 28:37.687
These boys drink alcohol, they chase girls,
they smoke hash, and...

28:37.866 --> 28:39.333
So did Mohamed Atta, right?

28:39.501 --> 28:41.867
- It's Takfir methodology.
- Takfir methodology.

28:42.470 --> 28:45.837
Correct. It's permitted in order
to deceive the infidel.

28:46.307 --> 28:49.538
You've had guys watching them
go in and out of this safe house here...

28:49.711 --> 28:50.905
...but what I don't get...

28:51.079 --> 28:53.877
...is why you haven't had anyone
monitoring them after.

28:54.048 --> 28:56.573
Well, there's so much activity
at this location...

28:56.751 --> 29:00.209
...that we have exhausted the station's
indigenous-appearing manpower.

29:00.388 --> 29:03.619
So you don't have enough good Arab guys
to follow the bad Arab guys...

29:03.792 --> 29:05.657
...is what you're saying.
- That's right.

29:05.827 --> 29:08.523
Well, you're gonna need
some more human surveillance...

29:08.696 --> 29:10.857
...loaners from Jordanian Intelligence.

29:11.366 --> 29:12.526
All right. Skip, get out.

29:20.175 --> 29:22.837
Now, I am in receipt of a directive...

29:23.011 --> 29:27.607
...which tells me that I am
to make myself useful to you...

29:27.782 --> 29:31.718
...in whichever way
that you request or require.

29:31.886 --> 29:35.845
But it is my feeling that to involve
the Jordanian secret service...

29:36.024 --> 29:38.288
...is a breach of operational integrity.

29:38.460 --> 29:41.725
You don't need to tell me
about Jordanian Intelligence, all right?

29:41.896 --> 29:44.956
They are doing a far superior job
than you are, my friend.

29:45.133 --> 29:46.760
You've read that directive there...

29:46.935 --> 29:49.802
...which clearly states that I am in charge
of this operation.

29:49.971 --> 29:52.963
So, what I need you to do
is leave this office immediately...

29:53.141 --> 29:55.075
...and hand your entire staff over to me.

29:57.946 --> 30:02.144
You know, we've all watched your rise
in the Near East Division.

30:03.084 --> 30:04.574
I'll see you on the way down.

30:05.720 --> 30:07.551
You and Hoffman both.

30:18.500 --> 30:21.697
I need you to help me out
and get me a fresh pot of coffee, please...

30:21.870 --> 30:24.930
...and a full staff meeting
within the next 15 minutes, all right?

30:25.106 --> 30:27.074
To be fair to Mr. Holiday, Mr. Ferris...

30:27.242 --> 30:29.938
...Mr. Hoffman never told us
this would be such a big deal.

30:30.111 --> 30:32.443
Ed Hoffman is the head
of the Near East Division.

30:32.614 --> 30:36.846
But he does not know shit until he steals it
from the guy on the ground, and that's me.

30:37.018 --> 30:39.543
Now, please stop acting
like such a fucking ingénue...

30:39.721 --> 30:43.418
...and try to get me a meeting
with Hani Salaam. Thanks.

30:59.707 --> 31:01.607
Mr. Ferris.

31:15.690 --> 31:17.021
Hani Pasha.

31:17.191 --> 31:19.625
Pasha? That is an Ottoman term.

31:19.794 --> 31:23.025
Well, I hear you like it, sir.
Pleasure to meet you.

31:23.565 --> 31:26.864
- Mr. Ferris, please take a seat.
- Thank you, sir.

31:29.637 --> 31:33.073
- Welcome to our promising country.
- Thank you so much.

31:33.241 --> 31:37.803
As reliable as your Ed Hoffman would call
a "towelhead monarchy" can be.

31:37.979 --> 31:40.880
Well, we'll leave that to Ed Hoffman, sir.

31:41.583 --> 31:43.050
Mm.

31:45.887 --> 31:47.980
What have you heard about this building?

31:48.156 --> 31:52.650
Well, to be quite honest,
I hear they call it the fingernail factory.

31:53.528 --> 31:55.928
But no one close to you would say that,
of course.

31:56.097 --> 31:57.564
No.

31:58.066 --> 32:00.534
But people are stupid.

32:01.469 --> 32:05.030
Torture doesn't work.

32:05.640 --> 32:09.940
Under torture, a man will say
almost anything to make the pain stop.

32:11.613 --> 32:13.740
You have experience with this, I am sure.

32:16.818 --> 32:18.342
Mr. Ferris, here in Jordan...

32:18.519 --> 32:21.955
...to the fundamentalists, you see,
I am, myself, the enemy.

32:22.724 --> 32:24.749
Perhaps the worst kind.

32:25.827 --> 32:30.127
Take not the Jews and Christians as allies.
Do you know it, Mr. Ferris?

32:36.738 --> 32:39.138
The dar-al-Harb. Very good.

32:39.307 --> 32:43.073
We are together, Hani Pasha,
in this House of War, yes.

32:43.244 --> 32:46.236
You are smarter than the Americans
who are usually sent to Amman.

32:46.414 --> 32:50.009
- Thank you, sir.
- I knew this, of course, before you came.

32:50.518 --> 32:53.919
You are young,
but you respect your elders.

32:54.088 --> 32:56.488
- You speak Arabic...
- Mm.

32:56.691 --> 32:59.353
...so you are a secret Arab.
- Mm.

33:07.435 --> 33:08.629
Now, ahem...

33:08.803 --> 33:11.636
We've recently discovered
a large Al-Saleem safe house...

33:11.806 --> 33:13.967
...and training cell here in Amman.

33:14.142 --> 33:16.235
I would need your help
with surveillance, sir.

33:17.745 --> 33:20.646
Now, this is what we know so far.

33:21.783 --> 33:22.807
This is unusual.

33:24.385 --> 33:27.616
Your Ed Hoffman would rather have less
information than share with me.

33:28.523 --> 33:31.856
Well, this is not Ed Hoffman.
This is not my predecessor.

33:32.026 --> 33:34.859
This is me, sir. Please, have a look.

33:47.275 --> 33:49.106
I have one rule...

33:49.277 --> 33:51.871
...if we are to cooperate, my dear.

33:52.880 --> 33:54.313
Never lie to me.

33:56.484 --> 33:58.315
Understand?

33:58.486 --> 34:00.283
Never lie to me.

34:04.859 --> 34:06.690
You shall have your agents.

34:06.861 --> 34:08.658
Thank you, sir.

34:09.630 --> 34:12.155
Agent Ferris is arriving at the site now.

34:12.333 --> 34:13.766
Thank you.

34:13.935 --> 34:16.960
Tracking now.
- Roger that, I'll reposition the aircraft.

34:17.138 --> 34:18.536
Slewing to 2.5.

34:28.248 --> 34:32.208
There it is. That's it.
That's the safe house.

34:37.725 --> 34:39.192
Come on.

34:45.199 --> 34:47.463
- What do you wanna do with this guy?
- Just watch.

34:47.635 --> 34:50.331
Watch him and what else?
- Nothing else.

34:51.639 --> 34:53.902
I'm not sure about this GID surveillance.

34:54.574 --> 34:57.874
- I can't see any of Hani's guys.
- Well, I've spotted a few so far.

34:58.045 --> 35:01.537
You see the two by the doorway there
in front of the safe house?

35:01.716 --> 35:03.183
There's one more selling radios.

35:03.351 --> 35:06.081
And there's one behind me
with a striped shirt.

35:06.254 --> 35:07.744
That's what I've clocked so far.

35:10.658 --> 35:13.252
Who's this? Who just sat down?

35:13.427 --> 35:15.019
That's one of our guys.

35:15.196 --> 35:18.393
- One of your guys? What do you...?
- A station asset.

35:18.566 --> 35:19.760
Zayed Ibishi.

35:20.201 --> 35:22.931
He's one of our contacts
from the Palestinian camps.

35:23.104 --> 35:24.833
Station asset, huh?

35:25.006 --> 35:27.440
What the fuck is he doing
making contact right now?

35:27.608 --> 35:31.066
- And how come I don't know about this?
- I don't know. I don't know.

35:31.612 --> 35:35.708
If he makes that jihadist suspicious,
they will shut down that house and leave.

35:35.883 --> 35:39.319
- He's gonna get that guy killed.
- He's gonna blow this whole operation.

35:40.188 --> 35:41.883
Not again. Fucking Hoffman!

35:48.663 --> 35:50.995
- Oops.
- Continue tracking.

35:51.165 --> 35:52.325
Area expanded.

35:52.500 --> 35:53.933
Tracking.

36:05.446 --> 36:07.505
Head him off! Head him off!

36:10.651 --> 36:12.778
Going down the alley.
- Adjusting coverage.

36:12.954 --> 36:13.978
Boost image factor.

36:20.161 --> 36:22.152
Switching to SAR.
- Stay with sweep.

36:25.700 --> 36:27.793
Hold image?
- Image locked.

36:30.171 --> 36:31.297
Ah!

36:55.529 --> 36:58.259
Skip. I got him.

36:58.432 --> 37:00.866
I need you to come pick me up, all right?

37:01.035 --> 37:05.062
I got bit by fucking diseased dogs,
goddamn it.

37:05.239 --> 37:07.207
I'm by the clearing.

37:07.375 --> 37:09.570
Yeah, just look out for me.

37:18.252 --> 37:21.221
You gotta be kidding me.
Come on, take me to a real hospital.

37:21.389 --> 37:23.584
- Take me to the embassy.
- That's like an hour.

37:23.758 --> 37:27.819
Rabies around here is no joke. You're gonna
need a jab in there, ASAP. Let's go.

37:27.995 --> 37:29.485
Let's go.

37:34.835 --> 37:37.861
Let's get you vaccinated. Aisha.

37:54.221 --> 37:55.245
AISHA

37:57.625 --> 37:59.058
Let me see.

38:02.129 --> 38:03.892
These are not bite wounds.

38:04.532 --> 38:07.296
- A snowboarding accident.
- Snowboarding.

38:07.468 --> 38:10.960
- Mm.
- You're accident prone, huh?

38:11.138 --> 38:15.074
Well, I mean,
I'm sure it looks that way. Yeah.

38:15.242 --> 38:17.142
Okay.

38:23.751 --> 38:25.514
Relax.

38:26.687 --> 38:29.781
All right. Let me...

38:35.262 --> 38:38.288
My father was Iranian.

38:39.433 --> 38:41.731
I live in Amman now.

38:45.373 --> 38:47.307
Okay.

38:48.175 --> 38:50.143
This is going to hurt.

38:50.444 --> 38:52.378
Mm. I don't like needles.

38:52.546 --> 38:54.844
Just think about something else, hm?

38:58.719 --> 38:59.743
Okay.

39:01.422 --> 39:05.984
This is the first of five anti-rabies injections
you'll need over the next month.

39:06.160 --> 39:07.684
You don't need to come back here.

39:07.862 --> 39:12.026
You can get them at any clinic.
One each week, right?

39:12.566 --> 39:15.126
- So we're done?
- Yeah, we're done.

39:15.302 --> 39:18.100
And someone will come
to bandage your wounds.

39:19.507 --> 39:21.168
Thank you.

39:21.442 --> 39:24.570
<i>You fucking cocksucker. How did</i>
<i>you expect me to run an operation...</i>

39:24.745 --> 39:27.839
<i>... when you're running a side operation</i>
<i>which fucks up my own?</i>

39:28.015 --> 39:31.382
Listen, you want me to run Amman,
let me run Amman, all right?

39:31.552 --> 39:34.578
I have made promises to Hani Salaam.
Do you understand that?

39:34.755 --> 39:36.245
Uh-huh. What's your point?

39:36.424 --> 39:40.019
<i>My point is, Ed, you can't pull</i>
<i>your normal bullshit here, all right?</i>

39:40.194 --> 39:44.221
- We have to respect what he wants.
- I do respect him. What kind of thing?

39:44.398 --> 39:49.062
Look, you keep fucking around like this, and
you are gonna blow this Amman operation.

39:49.236 --> 39:51.636
- I love you. Bye.
- I love you too.

39:51.806 --> 39:55.367
They'll vacate their only known safe house,
and we'll never hear from them.

39:55.543 --> 39:57.943
- Do you understand?
- I'm just trying to back you up.

39:58.112 --> 40:00.171
It's a dangerous,
dangerous world out there.

40:00.347 --> 40:03.248
Well, don't back me up,
because I don't need it, all right?

40:03.784 --> 40:06.719
- Hani.
- I gotta go deal with this Hani bullshit.

40:06.887 --> 40:10.254
- So go fuck yourself.
- All right, whatever.

40:11.659 --> 40:13.524
You ready to go?

40:13.694 --> 40:15.594
Whatever.

40:32.613 --> 40:35.514
Hani Pasha, if you would give me
an opportunity to ex...

40:36.884 --> 40:39.045
Fortunately the safe house is still there.

40:40.955 --> 40:43.981
As for the man you killed,
you were right.

40:44.158 --> 40:45.955
You made a good decision.

40:46.527 --> 40:50.327
The jihadists believe it was a robbery.
There are many robberies in that district.

40:50.498 --> 40:53.160
So you have been very clever, my dear.

40:53.334 --> 40:55.700
Well, that's good news, sir.

40:55.870 --> 40:57.394
Listen, Ed Hoffman had...

40:57.571 --> 41:00.699
I have spoken to Mr. Hoffman
very sharply.

41:00.875 --> 41:03.742
Now, we will explain
the king's espionage laws to his agent.

41:24.131 --> 41:27.532
I thought you didn't believe in torture,
Hani Pasha.

41:27.701 --> 41:31.296
This is punishment, my dear.
It's a very different thing.

41:35.976 --> 41:37.876
Keep watching.

41:39.079 --> 41:41.138
Tell Edward what you have seen.

42:57.591 --> 43:00.082
<i>Another deadly attack on innocent civilians.</i>

43:00.261 --> 43:04.197
<i>This time in one of Amsterdam's</i>
<i>most crowded tourist districts.</i>

43:04.365 --> 43:07.926
<i>The images of the bombing were captured</i>
<i>on location surveillance cameras.</i>

43:08.102 --> 43:10.229
<i>The blast felt for miles.</i>

43:10.404 --> 43:13.703
<i>What was once a block-long farmer market</i>
<i>vibrant with color...</i>

43:13.874 --> 43:15.501
<i>... is now in ruins and covered with ash.</i>

43:18.279 --> 43:20.144
<i>The exact number of casualties</i>
<i>is not yet known...</i>

43:20.314 --> 43:22.839
<i>... as emergency crews</i>
<i>are still pulling victims from the rubble.</i>

43:23.017 --> 43:27.010
<i>But officials are saying it will certainly be</i>
<i>in triple figures.</i>

43:27.521 --> 43:31.457
<i>KLPD antiterror-unit investigators</i>
<i>have arrived...</i>

43:31.625 --> 43:35.322
<i>... and are examining bomb fragments</i>
<i>in the hope of determining if this...</i>

43:35.496 --> 43:39.762
<i>... and the other recent bombings on the</i>
<i>continent and in the UK are connected.</i>

43:39.933 --> 43:44.302
<i>The consequence of a new bombing</i>
<i>will no doubt have a devastating effect...</i>

43:44.471 --> 43:46.769
<i>... on Europe's tourist business.</i>

43:46.940 --> 43:50.467
<i>Let's go now</i>
<i>to Amsterdam's chief of police.</i>

43:50.644 --> 43:55.411
<i>We will do whatever we can</i>
<i>to keep everyone safe...</i>

43:55.582 --> 43:59.018
<i>... for you to live every day</i>
<i>without being afraid.</i>

43:59.186 --> 44:01.381
<i>But we must be realistic.</i>

44:01.555 --> 44:07.084
<i>Terrorist threats are real, present,</i>
<i>deadly and persistent.</i>

44:10.064 --> 44:12.498
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

44:14.635 --> 44:15.659
Where are we going?

44:15.836 --> 44:17.736
We are going fishing.

44:17.905 --> 44:19.463
Get in.

44:26.780 --> 44:29.112
Since no credit was claimed
for the bombing...

44:29.283 --> 44:32.047
...we believe it to be the work
of Al-Saleem.

44:32.219 --> 44:34.687
That's his signature. Anonymity.

44:35.723 --> 44:38.123
So, what we need is... May I say we?

44:38.292 --> 44:41.750
Of course.
As long as we keep it between us.

44:42.429 --> 44:44.761
We need a man inside the Amman cell.

44:44.932 --> 44:46.399
We do. Yes.

44:46.567 --> 44:48.159
And we shall have the man we need.

44:48.335 --> 44:51.998
- How's that?
- Because you gave him to me.

44:53.640 --> 44:56.973
<i>His name is Mustafa Karami.</i>
<i>I've known him since he was a teenager...</i>

44:57.144 --> 45:00.011
<i>... selling boom boxes</i>
<i>from the back of a stolen truck.</i>

45:00.180 --> 45:02.876
<i>Now he's al Qaeda. In my country.</i>

45:04.218 --> 45:05.845
<i>Watch and learn, my dear.</i>

45:06.019 --> 45:07.281
Watch and learn.

45:43.323 --> 45:44.654
KARAMI:

45:46.126 --> 45:48.993
You did not think to tell Hani Salaam
you are a jihadist?

45:50.197 --> 45:53.462
You have become a religious man, hm?

45:53.634 --> 45:55.226
No longer a thief.

45:56.170 --> 45:57.933
Can it be true?

45:59.072 --> 46:00.232
Here.

46:02.109 --> 46:03.303
Take the phone.

46:03.477 --> 46:05.911
Take it and talk to your mother.

46:06.547 --> 46:08.014
Talk.

46:11.084 --> 46:13.245
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>
- Hello.

46:14.955 --> 46:18.288
His mother was in the Palestinian camps.

46:18.459 --> 46:22.020
Now she has a fine apartment
and a beautiful garden.

46:22.196 --> 46:25.529
She can watch the sun set over the hills.

46:25.699 --> 46:30.796
She has a refrigerator, couch,
even a television set.

46:30.971 --> 46:34.839
She will tell him she is proud of him, that
she always knew he would be a success...

46:35.008 --> 46:37.533
...even when he was a little boy
in the refugee camps.

46:37.711 --> 46:39.645
And now he has sent her money.

46:39.813 --> 46:41.974
She is glad he is no longer mixed up
with the radicals.

46:56.196 --> 46:59.290
You are God's blessing to your mother,
Mustafa.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.935
You have done none of these things for her.
But you should have.

47:03.770 --> 47:06.671
A mother is worth more
than anything they have told you.

47:06.840 --> 47:11.209
You know, you will be better in the future
because we have sent her many gifts...

47:11.378 --> 47:13.972
...and we have told her these gifts come
from her son.

47:18.452 --> 47:19.885
HANI:

47:20.721 --> 47:23.246
Continue your life with your brothers
in al Qaeda.

47:23.423 --> 47:25.618
We will devise a way to talk. Come.

47:27.294 --> 47:30.422
Come. No, no, no. Come, come, come.

47:30.597 --> 47:33.293
Up, up, up.

47:36.303 --> 47:37.600
Go.

47:44.044 --> 47:47.605
And so we throw him back into the sea,
to swim where he naturally swims...

47:47.781 --> 47:50.545
...to learn what he naturally learns...

47:50.717 --> 47:53.447
...and see how long he remembers
my benevolence.

47:54.922 --> 47:56.321
And what if he forgets?

47:57.491 --> 48:01.655
If he forgets, I remind him that I have
the power of life and death over him...

48:01.828 --> 48:06.231
...because, you see, any time I wish,
I can let them know he works for me.

48:07.467 --> 48:08.764
Hm.

48:11.538 --> 48:12.664
<i>Ed?</i>

48:12.839 --> 48:14.704
<i>So tell me about Hani's guy.</i>

48:14.875 --> 48:16.775
- Who?
- <i>Karami, the guy on the bike.</i>

48:16.944 --> 48:19.378
<i>What do you think I do in my spare time,</i>
<i>play tennis?</i>

48:19.546 --> 48:22.709
- <i>I look like a tennis player to you?</i>
- It's not gonna happen, Ed.

48:22.883 --> 48:26.785
<i>Buddy, we're a results-oriented</i>
<i>organization, and we need results now...</i>

48:26.954 --> 48:28.854
<i>... because otherwise I will be unhappy.</i>

48:29.022 --> 48:31.286
You'll be unhappy, and he'll say, <i>"Insa."</i>

48:31.458 --> 48:32.550
<i>What does that mean?</i>

48:32.726 --> 48:34.557
Means "too fucking bad,"
is what it means.

48:34.728 --> 48:38.095
<i>Too fucking bad?</i>
<i>Europe is getting hammered, boy. All right?</i>

48:38.265 --> 48:40.358
<i>Nobody knows where the next bomb</i>
<i>is going off.</i>

48:40.534 --> 48:42.525
<i>There's 75 dead in Amsterdam.</i>

48:42.703 --> 48:45.137
<i>You can call me sentimental</i>
<i>if you want to, buddy...</i>

48:45.305 --> 48:47.034
Ed, listen, Hani does not trust you.

48:47.207 --> 48:49.198
Arabs will only help you if they trust you.

48:49.376 --> 48:51.344
We need to earn that trust,
you understand?

48:51.511 --> 48:52.705
<i>What are you, moving here?</i>

48:52.879 --> 48:57.077
<i>I don't care about cultural insecurity issues.</i>
<i>I don't care if Hani trusts me or not.</i>

48:57.250 --> 48:59.912
<i>What he will do is he will thank me</i>
<i>in the long run. Fuck.</i>

49:00.087 --> 49:02.078
<i>Hold on. Hold on.</i>

49:03.724 --> 49:05.521
Buddy, you're home.

49:06.927 --> 49:09.828
Jesus Christ, Ed,
you scared the shit out of me.

49:09.997 --> 49:12.761
They say that you should
never drink red wine in the desert.

49:12.933 --> 49:14.901
That's what did in the Babylonians, right?

49:15.068 --> 49:18.902
Well, a couple of bottles of that
and we'll be speaking Babylonian.

49:19.072 --> 49:21.939
So how was your flight?

49:22.109 --> 49:25.943
Oh, it was fine. It was fine.
Yeah. I watched that <i>Poseidon.</i>

49:27.314 --> 49:30.442
I see you've made yourself at home.

49:44.931 --> 49:47.491
In the words of the great Sam Snead:

49:47.668 --> 49:51.764
"If you're not thinking about pussy,
you're just not concentrating."

49:51.938 --> 49:53.098
My dear.

49:53.273 --> 49:55.070
Jesus Christ. Come on.

49:57.811 --> 49:59.369
Hani Pasha.

49:59.546 --> 50:00.979
Thank you for your time.

50:01.148 --> 50:02.410
Please.

50:03.050 --> 50:06.542
I'm gonna need a piece of this guy you got
here in this Amman cell.

50:06.720 --> 50:09.280
Don't look at buddy.
Buddy didn't say nothing.

50:09.456 --> 50:13.324
These jihadists might not use their cell
phones, Hani, but you do use yours, right?

50:13.994 --> 50:15.018
Please.

50:15.195 --> 50:18.130
Now, don't say no before I say anything.

50:18.298 --> 50:20.926
Just let me say
what I've come here to say.

50:21.868 --> 50:27.101
Thank you. You have done an incredible job
developing this guy Karoobi.

50:28.008 --> 50:29.236
Katoomi.

50:29.409 --> 50:31.036
- Karami.
- Karami.

50:31.211 --> 50:35.705
Now, we develop these assets
to use them as needed.

50:35.882 --> 50:37.110
And I have a need.

50:38.018 --> 50:39.849
No.

50:42.856 --> 50:46.348
- I'm just gonna get all frustrated here.
- Why are you frustrated, Edward?

50:46.526 --> 50:48.187
Because we have a partnership.

50:48.361 --> 50:50.693
You have something that I need
that will help me...

50:50.864 --> 50:52.491
...and you won't allow that to happen.

50:52.666 --> 50:55.829
And I'm trying to impress upon you
a sense of urgency.

50:56.002 --> 51:00.496
Urgency does not call for changing methods
that work for methods that do not work.

51:01.374 --> 51:03.433
Now, who pays the bills around here?

51:03.610 --> 51:06.477
I would hate to have to have my president
call your king.

51:06.646 --> 51:09.206
Because that's just gonna
be embarrassing for all of us.

51:09.382 --> 51:13.148
In matters of intelligence, Edward,
you are speaking to the king.

51:13.320 --> 51:15.083
- Is that right?
- Mm.

51:15.889 --> 51:19.655
Well, Your Highness, I want control.

51:19.826 --> 51:23.523
- As a favor to the United States.
- You can't have it.

51:24.664 --> 51:28.725
I could tell you we will run him jointly,
but it would not be the truth.

51:28.902 --> 51:33.134
Real intelligence operations,
they remain secret forever.

51:34.141 --> 51:39.272
You Americans, you are incapable
of secrecy because you are a democracy.

51:39.446 --> 51:42.609
Now, I know my business.

51:42.783 --> 51:45.217
I have never failed you, have I?

51:45.385 --> 51:50.652
No, you have not. Are you sure
you wanna make this the first time?

51:50.857 --> 51:53.690
Edward, you're missing the point.

51:53.860 --> 51:55.725
Karami, he doesn't know anything.

51:55.896 --> 51:58.364
That is not the way
the organization operates.

51:58.532 --> 52:02.730
I will ask him what he knows
when it is time.

52:02.903 --> 52:06.270
- Now, are you happy?
- I'm getting there.

52:08.074 --> 52:10.372
Now, you guys
might have invented algebra...

52:10.544 --> 52:12.876
...but we're the guys
that found out how to use it.

52:13.046 --> 52:16.106
I presume you know who that is?

52:16.283 --> 52:18.183
It's a recent photograph of Al-Saleem.

52:18.351 --> 52:20.615
You didn't have that one, did you?

52:20.787 --> 52:23.551
Well, that's yours.
You can keep that because we're partners.

52:23.723 --> 52:27.591
All right? Now, I'm fulfilling my side
of the bargain, okay?

52:27.761 --> 52:31.197
Now's the time for some reciprocity.

52:32.732 --> 52:34.597
You need to give me Karami.

52:40.640 --> 52:41.664
<i>Insa.</i>

52:42.943 --> 52:47.744
- That's, "Too fucking bad."
- I know what that means.

52:48.615 --> 52:50.810
Well, that was
fucking embarrassing, hm?

52:51.718 --> 52:53.709
You still thinking about pussy, Ed?

52:53.887 --> 52:58.153
Don't be a smart aleck.
Thing about that Hani, he's bright.

52:58.325 --> 53:00.725
But he's also arrogant.
That's gonna be his undoing.

53:00.894 --> 53:03.124
You're talking about him, right?

53:03.296 --> 53:04.490
Just flow with me, buddy.

53:04.664 --> 53:08.361
Jesus Christ. You have a recent photograph
of Al-Saleem.

53:08.535 --> 53:11.163
Don't you think I could've used intel
like that, Ed?

53:11.338 --> 53:13.806
What the hell else
are you holding back from me?

53:13.974 --> 53:15.032
What do you wanna know?

53:15.208 --> 53:17.176
Well, for one thing, what's his real name?

53:17.344 --> 53:20.006
Kareem Al-Shams.

53:20.780 --> 53:22.213
His birthplace?

53:22.382 --> 53:25.283
Syria. Hama.

53:26.386 --> 53:28.081
Background?

53:28.255 --> 53:32.658
Well, his loving middle-class family
got killed by Hafez Assad...

53:32.826 --> 53:35.124
<i>... so he moved to Saudi Arabia.</i>

53:35.295 --> 53:39.755
<i>Studied physics and engineering in Riyadh,</i>
<i>then here in Amman.</i>

53:39.933 --> 53:43.733
<i>Post-graduate study at the University of</i>
<i>North Carolina. He's a Tar Heel like you.</i>

53:43.904 --> 53:47.772
<i>Now, he prides himself on his humility</i>
<i>and not having to take the credit.</i>

53:47.941 --> 53:51.399
<i>Yet this is the same man who will go</i>
<i>on videotape with his brothers...</i>

53:51.578 --> 53:54.308
<i>... describing what he's done</i>
<i>and what's gonna come.</i>

53:54.481 --> 53:57.507
<i>His is a false humility.</i>
<i>It's a false modesty.</i>

53:57.684 --> 54:01.211
<i>His ego is more powerful than his beliefs,</i>
<i>more dangerous.</i>

54:01.388 --> 54:03.049
<i>And that is his weakness.</i>

54:03.223 --> 54:08.752
<i>Now, all we got to do, Ferris,</i>
<i>is just get that fucker on the phone.</i>

54:13.199 --> 54:14.223
Ed?

54:14.401 --> 54:16.028
Yeah.

54:16.202 --> 54:20.639
Don't do anything about Karami, huh?
Don't try to flip him or anything like that.

54:20.807 --> 54:22.968
Hani will throw me out.
I promise you that.

54:23.143 --> 54:24.872
This operation will be over.

54:25.979 --> 54:29.676
You cannot trust Hani. Am I clear?

54:30.550 --> 54:32.381
You're clear.

54:33.720 --> 54:36.917
Good. You and I gotta get drunk
because I need to sleep on the plane.

54:37.090 --> 54:40.491
I have to take the kids
to <i>The Lion King.</i> Again.

54:41.761 --> 54:43.023
Never have kids.

54:44.364 --> 54:47.856
- Ed, did you hear what I said, right?
- Oh, yeah.

54:48.034 --> 54:52.334
- Don't... Don't touch Karami.
- All right.

54:52.872 --> 54:54.772
Never.

55:11.191 --> 55:13.557
That's Karami. We're on. Get the van.

55:45.492 --> 55:47.653
Move the fucking van!

55:50.130 --> 55:52.496
Go! Go, go, go!

55:59.272 --> 56:00.296
Fuck!

56:11.818 --> 56:15.481
I thought I told you
you could get this at any clinic.

56:15.655 --> 56:20.115
And you should have had
your injection yesterday.

56:20.293 --> 56:22.557
You weren't on duty yesterday.

56:22.729 --> 56:26.859
Besides, when you find a good doctor,
you don't change, right?

56:27.033 --> 56:28.227
I'm not a doctor.

56:32.605 --> 56:34.505
The same thing. You don't change.

56:35.875 --> 56:36.899
Wife.

56:37.077 --> 56:39.978
Well, I don't have a ring.

56:40.146 --> 56:42.671
No, but you did last week.

56:42.882 --> 56:45.248
Ah. So you noticed?

56:46.619 --> 56:48.086
Bad husband.

56:48.822 --> 56:51.950
Ah! Yes. Ahem.
Yes, I was a bad husband.

56:52.125 --> 56:54.423
And she was an even worse wife...

56:54.594 --> 56:57.461
...which is why we're divorced now.

56:57.630 --> 56:58.654
It's over.

57:01.835 --> 57:04.360
And now you're looking
for something else, huh?

57:05.071 --> 57:08.097
Something as different from her
as you can find.

57:08.274 --> 57:11.937
Something close to impossible.

57:12.112 --> 57:13.739
We're done.

57:14.681 --> 57:16.171
Till next week.

57:24.157 --> 57:25.784
May I?

57:25.959 --> 57:28.154
Yes.

57:29.062 --> 57:31.553
I was wondering if maybe...

57:31.731 --> 57:35.667
...you wanted to have a conversation
sooner than next week.

57:35.835 --> 57:39.202
Maybe, <i>inshallah,</i> later this afternoon...

57:39.372 --> 57:41.567
...if that wouldn't make you
uncomfortable.

57:42.942 --> 57:47.038
Well, for you and me
to be able to do that...

57:47.213 --> 57:49.647
...first we would have
to have a conversation...

57:49.816 --> 57:52.580
...about the proper way
to have a conversation.

57:53.686 --> 57:55.677
Anyway, where I'm going
this afternoon...

57:55.855 --> 57:59.052
...would make you more uncomfortable
than me.

57:59.225 --> 58:02.217
Well, I doubt that.

58:02.395 --> 58:04.226
I don't.

58:34.260 --> 58:35.352
WOMAN

58:42.001 --> 58:45.732
If you're trying to figure out how far I'll go
in order to express my interest...

58:45.905 --> 58:48.339
...I think you have the answer.

58:49.175 --> 58:51.405
- Do I?
- Mm.

58:51.578 --> 58:54.843
What else are you supposed to do
at this point? Leave here alone?

58:55.415 --> 58:58.350
You're safer with me and you know it.

58:58.518 --> 59:00.486
What are you asking?

59:00.653 --> 59:03.121
I'm asking what you do here.

59:03.823 --> 59:05.518
Well, I'm a political adviser.

59:06.859 --> 59:08.451
Who snowboards in Amman.

59:08.628 --> 59:11.153
- That's right.
- Yeah, yeah.

59:11.331 --> 59:15.267
Listen, I have a thing to tell you,
an important one.

59:15.435 --> 59:18.768
A man is not his job.

59:18.938 --> 59:22.203
I mean, he's apart from his job. The man.

59:22.375 --> 59:24.206
I understand.

59:24.377 --> 59:27.369
No, I just want you
to know my feeling, my...

59:27.547 --> 59:30.380
My understanding of you.

59:30.550 --> 59:32.882
- Well, thank you.
- You're welcome.

59:42.295 --> 59:44.786
May I see you again, Aisha?

59:53.306 --> 59:55.672
When you wish
and with your permission, of course.

59:55.842 --> 59:59.403
Where did you learn to speak Arabic
like this?

01:00:00.313 --> 01:00:02.907
Yeah, yeah, we are friends.

01:00:03.082 --> 01:00:04.344
We may talk again.

01:00:05.351 --> 01:00:07.012
We may.

01:00:07.186 --> 01:00:09.450
Well, thank you.

01:00:25.038 --> 01:00:26.733
He's my friend.

01:00:28.675 --> 01:00:31.371
- It's fine. It's fine.
- You sure?

01:00:32.578 --> 01:00:33.909
It's fine.

01:00:35.581 --> 01:00:36.741
What's this all about?

01:02:07.073 --> 01:02:09.633
Marwan showed you the burning house?

01:02:10.543 --> 01:02:11.805
Do you know what happened?

01:02:11.978 --> 01:02:14.344
I have absolutely no idea.

01:02:15.515 --> 01:02:19.417
You see, you could have said
to me yes or no. Simply that.

01:02:19.585 --> 01:02:23.749
When a man says to me more
than yes or no, then I begin to wonder.

01:02:23.923 --> 01:02:27.017
I don't know what happened, Hani.

01:02:29.495 --> 01:02:34.023
We had the advantage.
That house could have led us to Al-Saleem.

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:36.760
Now it is gone.
Everything inside it is gone.

01:02:36.936 --> 01:02:38.665
Here. Kneel.
- Hani, listen to me, I...

01:02:38.838 --> 01:02:41.363
I told you never to lie to me.

01:02:41.541 --> 01:02:43.338
I am not lying to you, Hani.

01:02:43.509 --> 01:02:46.774
You did not know that this man,
after everything I said to you...

01:02:46.946 --> 01:02:50.109
...everything I said to Edward,
that he tried to take Karami?

01:02:51.350 --> 01:02:53.682
He did not know.

01:02:53.853 --> 01:02:56.083
When I want to speak with you,
I will look at you.

01:02:57.623 --> 01:02:59.090
Now I am talking to Mr. Ferris.

01:03:00.126 --> 01:03:02.959
So in as few words as possible...

01:03:03.596 --> 01:03:04.927
...did you know?

01:03:05.665 --> 01:03:07.428
No.

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:09.625
I don't believe you.

01:03:10.403 --> 01:03:12.735
You have 12 hours to leave Jordan.

01:03:12.905 --> 01:03:16.204
If I find you here,
I will not be responsible for your safety.

01:03:16.375 --> 01:03:17.842
Do you understand me?

01:03:33.726 --> 01:03:36.422
Now, you knew you needed
to adapt to this environment.

01:03:36.596 --> 01:03:39.087
Ferris, I know, but, you know, I...

01:03:46.439 --> 01:03:47.633
Ferris!

01:03:53.913 --> 01:03:55.380
Ferris!

01:04:12.698 --> 01:04:16.190
Well, hey, buddy. Back from the sandbox?

01:04:16.369 --> 01:04:18.667
Enjoying civilization?
You wanna get a hot dog?

01:04:18.838 --> 01:04:22.205
How do you expect me to operate, Ed,
when you're keeping all the cards?

01:04:22.375 --> 01:04:25.208
- What about an ice cream?
- All Hani wanted was patience, Ed.

01:04:25.378 --> 01:04:28.040
- Patience. Not as a personal quality...
- I don't care.

01:04:28.214 --> 01:04:31.877
Not as a personal quality, but an operational
requirement, and you can't do it?

01:04:32.051 --> 01:04:35.509
You're too power hungry and greedy.
You fucked this whole operation up!

01:04:35.688 --> 01:04:38.020
For chrissakes,
I thought Hani wanted to kill me!

01:04:38.190 --> 01:04:39.350
Oh, don't exaggerate.

01:04:39.525 --> 01:04:43.188
Hani don't want to kill you.
He likes you. He likes you a lot.

01:04:43.362 --> 01:04:47.526
And who is he gonna get over there
better for him than you? Nobody.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.026
Don't worry. You're gonna
be back in Jordan before you know it.

01:04:51.203 --> 01:04:53.364
Back with your Jordanian
piece of poontang...

01:04:53.539 --> 01:04:56.303
...that you think I don't know about,
but I do.

01:04:56.475 --> 01:04:59.171
You're a fat fucking piece of shit,
you know that, Ed?

01:04:59.345 --> 01:05:02.143
We do this shit for a living,
go on a diet, for chrissakes.

01:05:02.315 --> 01:05:06.649
Are you quite finished?
Now, I did what I had to do.

01:05:07.853 --> 01:05:10.447
I ain't got time to play
Patience, <i>Sidi,</i> Patience...

01:05:10.623 --> 01:05:12.887
...and sit around eating couscous.

01:05:15.461 --> 01:05:19.056
Hani's interests extend only
to his own little fiefdom.

01:05:19.231 --> 01:05:20.664
Mine are global.

01:05:22.335 --> 01:05:23.825
Now, having said that...

01:05:24.003 --> 01:05:29.305
...I admit that perhaps, possibly, I should
have, from an operational standpoint...

01:05:29.475 --> 01:05:31.670
...brought you into what I was doing.
- Exactly.

01:05:31.844 --> 01:05:35.211
What you should've done was listen
to what Hani said, and you know that.

01:05:38.784 --> 01:05:41.582
You know, 10 years ago,
I could've beat the crap out of you.

01:05:41.754 --> 01:05:44.018
Should've taken the shot
when you had the chance.

01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:46.385
Maybe I should've. Can't do it now.

01:05:47.493 --> 01:05:51.020
What we need to do,
with or without the cooperation of Hani...

01:05:51.197 --> 01:05:54.997
...is get our own man
inside Al-Saleem's tent.

01:05:56.268 --> 01:05:59.203
We could penetrate every goddamn
Salafi mosque in the world...

01:05:59.372 --> 01:06:01.602
...and still not even get close.

01:06:06.178 --> 01:06:08.738
- But Al-Saleem doesn't know that, right?
- What?

01:06:08.914 --> 01:06:12.907
He doesn't know that.
I mean, he doesn't know what we can't do.

01:06:13.085 --> 01:06:15.110
He doesn't know how close
or how far we are.

01:06:15.287 --> 01:06:17.187
He doesn't know what's true
or what isn't.

01:06:17.356 --> 01:06:21.224
I mean... Look, Osama fed Zarqawi
to the dogs...

01:06:21.394 --> 01:06:23.487
...because he was getting
too powerful, right?

01:06:23.663 --> 01:06:25.961
- Right.
- What if instead of tracking Al-Saleem...

01:06:26.132 --> 01:06:29.260
...like we're doing right now
with absolutely no results...

01:06:29.435 --> 01:06:33.235
...we make it appear that there
is another terrorist operation out there...

01:06:33.406 --> 01:06:35.101
...just as effective as his own?

01:06:35.274 --> 01:06:39.176
I mean, how would Al-Saleem react
to that kind of challenge to his stats?

01:06:39.345 --> 01:06:41.836
- What would he do?
- He would get paranoid.

01:06:42.014 --> 01:06:44.608
- He might rejoice. Maybe both.
- Exactly.

01:06:44.784 --> 01:06:47.548
But either way,
he'd try to get in contact with them, right?

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:50.245
- Right.
- Which would be us.

01:06:51.257 --> 01:06:53.122
That would be us.

01:06:54.393 --> 01:06:57.419
You're a devious SOB.

01:06:57.596 --> 01:07:01.088
- We can't do this out of Langley.
- No. No, sir.

01:07:21.554 --> 01:07:24.614
Garland. Roger Ferris.
Pleased to meet you.

01:07:24.790 --> 01:07:26.189
Where's Hoffman?

01:07:26.358 --> 01:07:28.622
I don't know. Ben & Jerry's.

01:07:31.697 --> 01:07:33.722
He trusts you.

01:07:33.899 --> 01:07:38.768
I don't trust him. Every time we run
an operation and I don't see Hoffman...

01:07:38.938 --> 01:07:41.873
...it means he's running
another operation. Coffee?

01:07:42.041 --> 01:07:44.839
Yes, please. Black. Thank you.

01:07:45.711 --> 01:07:49.374
- Fruit? Strawberries, plums, apples?
- No, thanks.

01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:53.878
We're tracking a cell in Syria.
Last night, they were in Damascus.

01:07:54.053 --> 01:07:58.183
Today, Dayr Az-Zawr and the Iraqi border.

01:07:58.357 --> 01:08:01.554
But something tells me
they won't make it to Hasbaya.

01:08:01.727 --> 01:08:06.255
We have ninjas waiting.

01:08:06.432 --> 01:08:09.196
Who do these ninjas work for?

01:08:09.368 --> 01:08:10.801
Me.

01:08:10.970 --> 01:08:12.699
Shall we?

01:08:20.412 --> 01:08:23.609
So where is everyone?

01:08:23.783 --> 01:08:25.716
Absolutely no idea what you mean.

01:08:25.885 --> 01:08:31.551
- What? You mean it's just you?
- No. It's me and you.

01:08:31.724 --> 01:08:34.658
Did you think there'd be some
war room with lights flashing...

01:08:34.827 --> 01:08:36.225
...and people with clipboards?

01:08:36.395 --> 01:08:39.488
No, it's all here and here and here.
And here.

01:08:39.665 --> 01:08:42.361
Sure you won't have a strawberry?
They're really delicious.

01:08:42.535 --> 01:08:44.901
Yeah, no, I'm positive.

01:08:45.069 --> 01:08:49.200
Look, I'm gonna need some really, really
low-level al Qaeda contacts, all right?

01:08:49.375 --> 01:08:53.175
No one too extreme. Picture somewhere
in between Osama and Oprah.

01:08:53.345 --> 01:08:54.470
You get my drift?

01:08:54.647 --> 01:08:57.912
I'm gonna need a security consultant,
a lawyer.

01:08:58.082 --> 01:09:01.211
I'm gonna need an Arab who travels
throughout the region, all right?

01:09:01.386 --> 01:09:05.756
A businessman. Someone who fits the role
of jihadist without actually being jihadist.

01:09:05.925 --> 01:09:07.085
A straw man.

01:09:08.493 --> 01:09:12.225
Receiving money, making plans.

01:09:12.398 --> 01:09:14.298
That kind of thing.

01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:17.125
Okay, no.

01:09:17.303 --> 01:09:19.032
No.

01:09:19.205 --> 01:09:20.433
No.

01:09:21.941 --> 01:09:24.603
Hang on. There you go.
Second from the top.

01:09:24.777 --> 01:09:27.644
Omar Sadiki. He's Jordanian.
He's an architect.

01:09:28.546 --> 01:09:32.448
Most of his commissions
are from charitable Islamic groups...

01:09:32.618 --> 01:09:34.483
...who then give money to the jihadists.

01:09:34.653 --> 01:09:37.121
So he ticks all the jihadist boxes...

01:09:37.288 --> 01:09:40.156
...except he's innocent.

01:09:40.326 --> 01:09:43.193
So he touches his head to the floor
five times a day.

01:09:43.362 --> 01:09:45.921
He believes in God.

01:09:46.098 --> 01:09:49.328
So why would he trade
with an infidel like myself?

01:09:51.337 --> 01:09:52.497
Money.

01:10:14.894 --> 01:10:17.124
Mr. Sadiki.

01:10:19.765 --> 01:10:21.392
Hello, Mr. Sadiki.

01:10:21.567 --> 01:10:24.866
Mr. Sadiki, it's Brad Scanlon
from Hayes Andover Bank.

01:10:25.037 --> 01:10:27.335
I'm following up on my email.

01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:28.964
Yeah.

01:10:29.141 --> 01:10:31.974
Yeah, well, listen,
I got into Dubai a little bit early.

01:10:32.144 --> 01:10:38.105
I'm staying at the Jumeirah Emirates
Towers, but I can meet you anywhere.

01:10:38.284 --> 01:10:39.979
Well, fantastic.

01:10:47.359 --> 01:10:48.792
Anything else to know?

01:10:48.961 --> 01:10:50.553
Exactly as we discussed.

01:10:50.996 --> 01:10:52.020
I'm cool with that.

01:10:52.197 --> 01:10:54.665
- I'm used to knowing nothing.
- I'm sure you are, Tony.

01:10:54.833 --> 01:10:57.427
- Just get in position.
- Okay, boss.

01:10:59.571 --> 01:11:01.368
Mr. Sadiki.
- Yeah.

01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:06.409
Hayes Andover's option to buy this property
is gonna expire by the end of the month.

01:11:06.578 --> 01:11:08.739
We're hoping to get some sketches
and a bid...

01:11:08.914 --> 01:11:11.610
...by, say, next Thursday
before the Islamic weekend.

01:11:11.784 --> 01:11:13.718
Well, I think...

01:11:13.886 --> 01:11:15.251
- Yes, certainly.
- Hm.

01:11:15.421 --> 01:11:18.390
You'll also have to sign a letter of intent
with Mr. Al-Masri...

01:11:18.557 --> 01:11:20.115
...if that's okay with you.

01:11:20.292 --> 01:11:21.884
- Makes no difference to me.
- Great.

01:11:22.061 --> 01:11:26.896
- Allah will decide if I get the job or not.
- Fantastic.

01:11:27.066 --> 01:11:28.863
Mr. Al-Masri?

01:11:29.401 --> 01:11:30.425
Mr. Omar Sadiki.

01:11:37.076 --> 01:11:39.636
- Would anyone like some coffee?
- Yes, please. Thank you.

01:11:39.812 --> 01:11:43.145
<i>Ed, Al-Masri</i>
<i>is a lawyer we found with al Qaeda ties.</i>

01:11:43.315 --> 01:11:46.216
<i>He's fairly low on the map,</i>
<i>but he is on the map...</i>

01:11:46.385 --> 01:11:50.014
<i>... enough for a photograph</i>
<i>to suggest Sadiki's guilt by association.</i>

01:11:50.189 --> 01:11:52.384
Mm-hm. You have his computer?

01:11:53.125 --> 01:11:55.184
Yeah, look,
I'm gonna go get it right now.

01:11:55.361 --> 01:11:58.057
He's going to the Cyclone Club.
He loves the Russian girls.

01:11:58.230 --> 01:12:00.790
I'll call you soon. Call you soon.

01:12:02.067 --> 01:12:03.728
Three-sixteen.

01:12:46.912 --> 01:12:47.970
Come on, baby.

01:12:53.886 --> 01:12:55.217
- Garland?
- Yeah?

01:12:55.387 --> 01:12:57.150
<i>Stand by. All right?</i>

01:12:58.490 --> 01:13:01.152
Just getting in right now.

01:13:11.236 --> 01:13:14.228
Ah. This is useful.

01:13:14.907 --> 01:13:17.068
Very useful.

01:13:17.242 --> 01:13:22.111
I have an e-mail list of the members
of the Brothers of Awareness.

01:13:22.281 --> 01:13:24.340
<i>The Brothers of who-the-fuck?</i>

01:13:24.516 --> 01:13:28.179
The Ikhwan Ishfan. They're just a study
group of believers at his local mosque.

01:13:28.353 --> 01:13:30.321
But I can make it look like anything.

01:13:30.489 --> 01:13:33.686
All right. Let's make it look
like everything, huh?

01:13:41.533 --> 01:13:45.162
Now, make fake accounts
for half a dozen of the brothers...

01:13:45.337 --> 01:13:49.205
<i>... and start transferring money to them</i>
<i>from Sadiki's fake receiver account.</i>

01:13:49.374 --> 01:13:51.274
<i>Just small operational sums.</i>

01:13:51.443 --> 01:13:52.740
Okay.

01:13:56.415 --> 01:14:00.078
The Saudis will pick up the money moving,
and everything they pick up...

01:14:00.252 --> 01:14:02.686
They'll leak to the jihadists.

01:14:02.855 --> 01:14:06.621
- <i>You got it, my friend.</i>
- It's coming up. Now it's done.

01:14:44.496 --> 01:14:46.293
Dad! Dad!

01:14:47.166 --> 01:14:49.464
Hey, baby. Hold on. Oh.

01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:54.470
<i>Hey, Ed, you there?</i>
- Where are you?

01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:57.006
Dubai International. I'm on my way back.

01:14:57.176 --> 01:15:00.077
No, no, no. No, you're not.
You're going back to Amman.

01:15:00.646 --> 01:15:03.342
- Hani called, asked where you were.
- Jesus Christ.

01:15:03.515 --> 01:15:06.541
If you don't go back,
he's gonna wonder why you didn't go back.

01:15:06.718 --> 01:15:08.913
I think he likes you, buddy.
Change your ticket.

01:15:09.087 --> 01:15:12.056
- All right, Ed. I'm on my way.
- All right.

01:15:12.224 --> 01:15:14.988
- Oh, hey. Can I get that for you?
- Thank you.

01:15:22.534 --> 01:15:25.094
Mr. Ferris. Welcome.

01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:27.431
- Thank you.
- Come.

01:15:38.617 --> 01:15:43.554
I wanted to see you to tell you
I was sorry how we left things.

01:15:44.022 --> 01:15:47.480
- I was upset.
- Well, you had every right to be upset, sir.

01:15:47.659 --> 01:15:49.490
I apologize for what happened.

01:15:50.529 --> 01:15:52.588
But I am happy you are back.

01:15:53.398 --> 01:15:55.866
Miss Aisha, too, I think,
will be happy you are back.

01:15:56.735 --> 01:16:01.001
Don't worry, we're not watching you.
We're watching out for you.

01:16:01.740 --> 01:16:05.369
But I need you to understand, you
cannot afford any more mistakes in Jordan.

01:16:06.411 --> 01:16:09.642
This is a part of the world
where friendship matters.

01:16:10.449 --> 01:16:12.383
It can save your life.

01:16:12.584 --> 01:16:16.486
Why don't I call you back in about
15 minutes with all the information?

01:16:16.655 --> 01:16:18.919
Well, thanks so much, Mr. Sadiki.

01:16:20.025 --> 01:16:21.890
Let's get something clear, all right?

01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:24.187
I'm not tolerating any more
of your bullshit.

01:16:24.363 --> 01:16:26.388
- No, it's cool.
- Who do you work for?

01:16:26.565 --> 01:16:29.659
- I work for you. I got the call, I got briefed.
- All right, good.

01:16:29.835 --> 01:16:32.429
- Front? Back?
- Take my bag.

01:16:43.715 --> 01:16:48.345
If you're going to insist on coming here
to see me...

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:50.954
...which is what you're doing...

01:16:51.123 --> 01:16:54.718
...my sister's going to want to meet you.

01:16:56.395 --> 01:16:57.953
Your sister?

01:16:58.130 --> 01:17:02.794
Yeah, my sister looks after me
in matters that are non-medical.

01:17:04.903 --> 01:17:09.203
Oh, so she has to approve of me
before you will begin to.

01:17:10.509 --> 01:17:14.206
I would like her to think so,
whenever I can.

01:17:16.381 --> 01:17:17.405
Okay.

01:17:52.383 --> 01:17:54.078
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:17:54.252 --> 01:17:55.583
I'm still cooking.

01:17:55.753 --> 01:17:58.449
- Come in.
- I brought some dessert, pastry.

01:17:58.623 --> 01:18:00.784
Oh, the kids are going to love it.

01:18:00.958 --> 01:18:02.084
- The kids?
- Yeah.

01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:04.785
- Aha.
- Come.

01:18:07.165 --> 01:18:10.396
This is my sister, Cala.

01:18:12.070 --> 01:18:13.094
Mr. Ferris.

01:18:14.539 --> 01:18:18.873
And these are my nephews,
Yousef and Rowley.

01:18:19.043 --> 01:18:20.567
Hello.

01:18:20.745 --> 01:18:22.303
Yousef. Rowley. Hey.

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:23.879
Hi.
- Hi.

01:18:24.048 --> 01:18:26.608
- Nephews.
- Yeah, my nephews.

01:18:32.757 --> 01:18:35.021
Smells good in there, huh?

01:18:35.193 --> 01:18:37.218
It's not good.

01:18:40.131 --> 01:18:41.496
It's not good?

01:18:41.666 --> 01:18:44.635
- You don't like your mother's cooking?
- No, not really.

01:18:44.969 --> 01:18:45.993
Oh.

01:18:52.343 --> 01:18:54.470
What kind of food do you like?

01:18:54.645 --> 01:18:56.135
Hamburgers.

01:18:56.314 --> 01:18:58.544
- You?
- Spaghettis.

01:18:58.716 --> 01:19:00.411
Me too.

01:19:00.585 --> 01:19:04.715
So if there's anything that I wouldn't like,
would you two let me know?

01:19:06.624 --> 01:19:07.886
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:19:08.059 --> 01:19:09.117
Cool.

01:19:22.406 --> 01:19:25.603
So, Mr. Ferris...

01:19:26.144 --> 01:19:28.271
...how long are you in Amman?

01:19:29.046 --> 01:19:30.104
Oh, uh, ahem.

01:19:30.281 --> 01:19:34.240
Well, I think I'm gonna be for a while.
I hope so, anyway.

01:19:36.954 --> 01:19:39.184
Where were you stationed before?

01:19:40.625 --> 01:19:41.683
Riyadh.

01:19:42.727 --> 01:19:43.921
- Riyadh?
- Hm.

01:19:48.599 --> 01:19:50.999
What do you do exactly?

01:19:51.235 --> 01:19:55.296
I told you, Cala, he's a political adviser.

01:19:55.473 --> 01:19:57.532
Political adviser.

01:19:57.708 --> 01:20:00.905
But what does that mean?
Forgive my ignorance.

01:20:01.078 --> 01:20:03.842
- It means, uh...
- It means that I...

01:20:04.015 --> 01:20:08.748
Well, I offer my assistance to
His Majesty's advisers whenever they ask.

01:20:14.625 --> 01:20:17.594
But you do this now, not before the war.

01:20:17.762 --> 01:20:20.595
Before you didn't consult with us at all.

01:20:20.765 --> 01:20:24.030
- Cala, please, we are just having lunch.
- It's okay.

01:20:24.202 --> 01:20:25.567
- It's okay.
- We can talk...

01:20:25.736 --> 01:20:28.603
- I'm talking with your friend.
- Talk about another subject.

01:20:28.773 --> 01:20:30.536
It's quite all right. I understand.

01:20:30.708 --> 01:20:34.041
And we understand
that the situation in Iraq...

01:20:34.212 --> 01:20:38.308
...has created many hardships
for the Jordanian people.

01:20:38.983 --> 01:20:40.974
- The situation?
- You mean, the war.

01:20:41.152 --> 01:20:43.643
- He means war.
- No, no, no, he says the situation.

01:20:43.821 --> 01:20:45.516
- What do you mean?
- You know what...

01:20:45.690 --> 01:20:46.952
Please.

01:20:47.124 --> 01:20:51.060
I mean the roadside bombings,
the assassination of Iraqi police...

01:20:51.229 --> 01:20:53.697
...the kidnappings,
the crowded marketplaces...

01:20:53.864 --> 01:20:57.231
...and innocent families that have
been wiped off the face of the Earth.

01:20:57.401 --> 01:20:59.733
That's what I mean
by the situation in Iraq.

01:21:03.774 --> 01:21:06.607
I can tell you what
His Majesty's thinking.

01:21:07.745 --> 01:21:11.203
His Majesty believes the best hope
for the war is that it ends.

01:21:11.782 --> 01:21:14.273
Well, I can tell you
that is my hope as well.

01:21:14.952 --> 01:21:16.943
I hope so too. Huh?

01:21:17.121 --> 01:21:21.057
Cala? Hey. Peace.

01:21:21.225 --> 01:21:23.921
- Let's have lunch, huh?
- Okay.

01:21:24.095 --> 01:21:25.619
Enjoy.

01:21:25.796 --> 01:21:27.354
Thank you.

01:21:30.568 --> 01:21:33.059
- Well, sorry about that.
- Ah, so am I.

01:21:33.237 --> 01:21:36.900
I probably should've kept my mouth shut.
After all, I was a guest in your home.

01:21:37.074 --> 01:21:39.304
So is she. It didn't stop her, you know?

01:21:39.477 --> 01:21:42.810
She suffered a lot during Iran-Iraq war.

01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:47.007
And the funny thing
is that she wants to live in America.

01:21:47.184 --> 01:21:48.242
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:21:48.419 --> 01:21:51.752
Well, tell her I'll switch passports with her.
It'll make us both happy.

01:21:51.922 --> 01:21:53.822
Don't joke about these kind of things.

01:21:53.991 --> 01:21:58.758
I'm not joking. I'm perfectly serious.
I may stay here forever. Really.

01:22:00.398 --> 01:22:03.663
Well, anyway, I'm glad I made friends
with her boys. I like them a lot.

01:22:03.834 --> 01:22:05.665
Yeah, they're great, aren't they?

01:22:05.836 --> 01:22:09.067
But not very good spies, you know?
Neither are you.

01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:10.264
What do you mean?

01:22:10.441 --> 01:22:11.908
- At the table, you know?
- Oh.

01:22:12.677 --> 01:22:15.510
So you noticed. All right. I'm busted.

01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:18.672
Well, thank you, Aisha,
for inviting me in your home.

01:22:19.350 --> 01:22:20.442
Um...

01:22:26.223 --> 01:22:27.884
Sorry.

01:22:28.693 --> 01:22:30.888
- I had a really nice time.
- Sorry. Yeah, me too.

01:22:31.762 --> 01:22:34.959
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.

01:22:45.076 --> 01:22:49.274
The photograph was taken last week
in the Cyclone Club in Dubai.

01:22:49.447 --> 01:22:51.039
One is Al-Masri, a lawyer...

01:22:51.215 --> 01:22:56.152
...a low-level al Qaeda financier,
if that's not a contradiction in terms.

01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:58.754
The other is a Jordanian.

01:22:58.923 --> 01:23:01.619
An architect named Omar Sadiki.

01:23:02.893 --> 01:23:04.588
No known terrorist ties.

01:23:04.762 --> 01:23:10.632
Now, the question I ask myself is,
is what are they doing together?

01:23:15.506 --> 01:23:18.498
Is this Sadiki more than he claims to be?

01:23:19.110 --> 01:23:20.270
He travels a lot.

01:23:20.711 --> 01:23:23.646
He builds mosques and shopping malls.

01:23:23.814 --> 01:23:26.749
At the very least,
he bears examination by us.

01:23:26.917 --> 01:23:28.908
Or by we.

01:23:29.353 --> 01:23:30.786
Hm.

01:23:32.423 --> 01:23:33.685
Where'd you get these?

01:23:34.692 --> 01:23:36.956
- A friend in Saudi Intelligence.
- Mm.

01:23:37.661 --> 01:23:39.094
Useful friend, huh?

01:23:48.272 --> 01:23:49.705
No, keep it.

01:23:50.374 --> 01:23:52.433
I want you to have it.

01:23:52.610 --> 01:23:55.977
We are partners. Allies, no?

01:23:57.014 --> 01:23:59.847
Why would we not want
to help each other?

01:24:00.017 --> 01:24:03.111
Right. Thank you.

01:24:03.587 --> 01:24:05.350
<i>Garland.</i>
<i>- Yeah?</i>

01:24:05.523 --> 01:24:08.583
<i>Pull up an Arabic keyboard</i>
<i>and write down this message, you ready?</i>

01:24:08.759 --> 01:24:09.783
Okay.

01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:12.428
In the name of Go...
No, you know what, strike that.

01:24:12.596 --> 01:24:14.996
In the name of God the merciful...

01:24:15.166 --> 01:24:17.657
<i>... we praise our brothers</i>
<i>who shall carry out...</i>

01:24:17.835 --> 01:24:20.201
<i>... this heroic act in the fig orchard...</i>

01:24:20.371 --> 01:24:23.465
...and beg God to give us strength
for our continuing struggle.

01:24:23.641 --> 01:24:25.871
The time is at hand. All right?

01:24:26.043 --> 01:24:30.002
Now, that's absolutely delightful Arabic,
but what the fuck is the fig orchard?

01:24:30.181 --> 01:24:33.150
<i>I can't let you in on that yet.</i>
<i>Let's just say it's developing.</i>

01:24:33.317 --> 01:24:34.511
It'll create chatter...

01:24:34.685 --> 01:24:38.143
...but it's gotta be big enough
for Al-Saleem, to get his attention.

01:24:38.589 --> 01:24:39.749
Oh, it'll be big.

01:24:39.924 --> 01:24:42.757
Now, send that off
from Sadiki's fake e-mail address...

01:24:42.927 --> 01:24:44.588
<i>... and we are in business.</i>

01:24:44.762 --> 01:24:46.024
Okay. Done.

01:24:59.610 --> 01:25:01.737
<i>Advise when you're on the deck.</i>

01:25:12.723 --> 01:25:15.692
<i>Hello there, Mr. Sadiki.</i>
<i>It's Brad Scanlon.</i>

01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:19.523
I'm fine. Thanks so much for asking.
But we've got a bit of a problem.

01:25:19.697 --> 01:25:22.495
You see, our chief engineer,
who's based out of Ankara...

01:25:22.666 --> 01:25:26.227
...he's raised some issues
about the insulation.

01:25:26.403 --> 01:25:29.201
I realize it's the same stuff
that you use in Saudi Arabia...

01:25:29.373 --> 01:25:32.934
...but he's asked
to meet with you immediately.

01:25:33.110 --> 01:25:36.045
No, I'm sorry, sir.
He cannot fly up to see you.

01:25:36.213 --> 01:25:39.410
And the only time he can meet
is tomorrow afternoon.

01:25:39.583 --> 01:25:43.485
But the good news is, we have a car
ready to pick you up in about...

01:25:43.654 --> 01:25:48.318
...oh, six hours, and a plane ticket to Turkey
waiting for you at the airport.

01:25:49.126 --> 01:25:52.095
No, I'm sorry, sir.
First class was not available.

01:25:53.197 --> 01:25:55.392
<i>Ed, Sadiki just landed in Turkey.</i>

01:25:55.566 --> 01:25:57.397
<i>He's being met by one of our guys.</i>

01:25:57.568 --> 01:26:01.095
<i>An engineer to discuss business</i>
<i>and to show him a good time.</i>

01:26:01.272 --> 01:26:03.706
<i>All we need is to establish</i>
<i>that he is there.</i>

01:26:03.908 --> 01:26:05.899
- Mm-hm.
- <i>Now, the barracks at the base...</i>

01:26:06.076 --> 01:26:08.044
<i>... have been cleared out of all personnel.</i>

01:26:08.212 --> 01:26:10.305
<i>Bodies from the morgue</i>
<i>have been brought in.</i>

01:26:10.481 --> 01:26:13.382
<i>They'll be our so-called casualties.</i>

01:26:13.551 --> 01:26:17.920
<i>Now, Garland will send out a message</i>
<i>from Sadiki hinting that a strike is prepared.</i>

01:26:18.088 --> 01:26:19.487
And when the strike is done...

01:26:19.657 --> 01:26:23.252
...he'll post another message taking
responsibility for our little event.

01:26:23.427 --> 01:26:25.395
- You got that?
- Uh-huh.

01:26:25.563 --> 01:26:26.825
<i>After that...</i>

01:26:26.997 --> 01:26:30.694
...hopefully a buzz of messages
will then pass among jihadists' networks...

01:26:30.868 --> 01:26:34.964
<i>... announcing the Brothers of Awareness</i>
<i>as a new player.</i>

01:26:35.139 --> 01:26:37.801
And our Sadiki as its leader.
You got that?

01:26:37.975 --> 01:26:39.636
<i>All right, Ferris. Thank you.</i>

01:26:39.810 --> 01:26:41.175
<i>Tony, you have a go.</i>

01:26:48.619 --> 01:26:50.382
<i>We have a special report.</i>

01:26:50.554 --> 01:26:53.614
<i>A massive explosion</i>
<i>has taken place in Incirlik, Turkey.</i>

01:26:53.791 --> 01:26:56.919
<i>Officials have confirmed the</i>
<i>target of the blast to be the U.S. Air Base...</i>

01:26:58.295 --> 01:27:01.992
<i>... at Incirlik, Turkey. The bomb ripped</i>
<i>through the Bachelor Officers' Quarters...</i>

01:27:02.166 --> 01:27:04.327
<i>... at 3:00 this morning,</i>
<i>quickly engulfing it in flames.</i>

01:27:05.869 --> 01:27:08.497
<i>No one yet has claimed responsibility</i>
<i>for the attack.</i>

01:27:08.672 --> 01:27:12.369
<i>But terror experts are already speculating</i>
<i>this is the work of a new...</i>

01:27:12.543 --> 01:27:16.138
<i>... much more sophisticated and much</i>
<i>better financed offshoot of al Qaeda...</i>

01:27:16.313 --> 01:27:18.747
<i>... than that which is responsible</i>
<i>for the bombings...</i>

01:27:18.916 --> 01:27:21.680
<i>... in Amsterdam, London</i>
<i>and other European cities.</i>

01:27:21.852 --> 01:27:23.683
<i>In contrast to these recent bombings...</i>

01:27:23.854 --> 01:27:27.312
<i>... this is the first attack</i>
<i>to occur on American property.</i>

01:27:27.491 --> 01:27:28.753
- <i>The Pentagon...</i>
- Honey.

01:27:28.926 --> 01:27:32.453
<i>... will not release the names of the dead</i>
<i>until notification of next of kin.</i>

01:27:32.630 --> 01:27:35.360
<i>We're also being told that there</i>
<i>may never be a public announcement...</i>

01:27:35.532 --> 01:27:36.556
Honey.

01:27:36.734 --> 01:27:38.861
<i>... of the list of casualties</i>
<i>since some of the men killed...</i>

01:27:39.036 --> 01:27:41.903
<i>... may have been stationed at Incirlik</i>
<i>on classified missions.</i>

01:27:42.072 --> 01:27:45.940
<i>Incirlik, which in Turkish means fig orchard,</i>
<i>has served since September the 11 th...</i>

01:27:46.110 --> 01:27:49.568
<i>... as a primary hub in the wars</i>
<i>in Afghanistan and Iraq.</i>

01:27:49.747 --> 01:27:53.205
All right, now send out the message
taking credit.

01:27:53.384 --> 01:27:57.081
But make the responses go back
to Sadiki's actual account.

01:27:57.254 --> 01:27:59.745
- <i>You got that?</i>
- Okay.

01:28:04.728 --> 01:28:09.358
I can't say it's been real,
but you know what I mean.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:11.058
Yeah.

01:28:27.818 --> 01:28:31.777
AL-SALEEM

01:29:03.218 --> 01:29:05.345
SADIKI:

01:31:45.247 --> 01:31:46.942
<i>Hey there, little buddy.</i>

01:31:47.482 --> 01:31:51.248
<i>Well done. You did it.</i>
<i>NSA 's picking up all kinds of chatter.</i>

01:31:51.420 --> 01:31:52.580
<i>Haven't heard for years.</i>

01:31:52.754 --> 01:31:56.713
One voice on a world phone out of Vienna
sounds a lot like Al-Saleem himself.

01:31:56.892 --> 01:32:00.419
<i>Saying something along the lines of,</i>
<i>"Who the damn heck is Omar Sadiki?"</i>

01:32:00.595 --> 01:32:04.759
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Listen,
I made a decision, Ed. I'm bringing him in.

01:32:04.933 --> 01:32:07.595
- <i>Who?</i>
- Omar Sadiki, that's who.

01:32:07.769 --> 01:32:09.327
Oh, come on. No, no, no.

01:32:09.504 --> 01:32:13.133
When they find him, they are gonna
torture him and they are gonna kill him.

01:32:13.308 --> 01:32:17.005
You gotta decide which side of the cross
you're on. I need nailers, not hangers.

01:32:17.179 --> 01:32:19.511
Decision's already done, Ed.
I'm bringing him in.

01:32:19.681 --> 01:32:22.650
Ain't nobody innocent
in this shit, Ferris. Okay?

01:32:23.885 --> 01:32:24.909
Ferris.

01:32:25.754 --> 01:32:28.552
All right, don't move until I say, all right?

01:32:34.329 --> 01:32:35.796
<i>You got me?</i>

01:32:42.504 --> 01:32:43.994
Omar.

01:32:44.172 --> 01:32:46.936
It's Brad Scanlon.
We need to have a conversation. Come on.

01:32:47.109 --> 01:32:49.009
What are you doing here?

01:32:54.216 --> 01:32:57.276
Fuck! Omar! Omar, open the door!

01:32:57.452 --> 01:32:58.510
Let's go!

01:32:58.687 --> 01:33:01.053
Omar, listen to me!

01:33:01.223 --> 01:33:02.815
Omar! Omar!

01:33:03.492 --> 01:33:05.722
Let's go! Go, go, go!

01:33:18.473 --> 01:33:19.963
Fuck!

01:33:27.516 --> 01:33:30.383
This is Roger Ferris. I need an ambulance.

01:34:40.589 --> 01:34:42.580
LIEUTENANT:

01:35:31.907 --> 01:35:33.670
Yeah.

01:35:33.842 --> 01:35:35.969
<i>Sadiki is dead.</i>

01:35:36.945 --> 01:35:38.606
<i>You there?</i>

01:35:38.780 --> 01:35:40.145
Yeah, I'm here.

01:35:40.315 --> 01:35:42.215
I didn't kill him, buddy.

01:35:42.384 --> 01:35:43.544
<i>I know you didn't, Ed.</i>

01:35:45.220 --> 01:35:46.744
I did.

01:35:46.922 --> 01:35:50.517
Oh, buddy.
Buddy, that's just not constructive. Okay?

01:35:50.692 --> 01:35:53.627
- Then what is?
- Doing exactly what you're doing.

01:35:53.795 --> 01:35:57.561
And how are you measuring that? By how
much closer you've gotten to Al-Saleem?

01:35:57.732 --> 01:36:00.997
I bet you heard a shitload of chatter,
then it stopped, didn't it?

01:36:01.169 --> 01:36:02.466
That's right.

01:36:02.637 --> 01:36:04.628
<i>Well, then where is Al-Saleem?</i>

01:36:05.540 --> 01:36:08.008
- Hm?
- Ferris.

01:36:08.710 --> 01:36:11.042
You know what? I've had it.

01:36:11.212 --> 01:36:13.146
I've had it. I can't do this anymore.

01:36:13.915 --> 01:36:14.939
Yes, you can.

01:36:15.116 --> 01:36:17.744
Now, you just get yourself
a couple of hours' sleep.

01:36:17.919 --> 01:36:19.819
And call me
when you're thinking straight.

01:36:19.988 --> 01:36:23.924
You know what? I am thinking straight.
You're not, all right?

01:36:24.092 --> 01:36:26.822
You can't, because you're
a million fucking miles away.

01:36:26.995 --> 01:36:28.462
I'm here, Ed, every day.

01:36:28.630 --> 01:36:30.962
And I see the unnecessary travesties
of this war...

01:36:31.132 --> 01:36:34.568
<i>... that the rest of you backstabbing</i>
<i>political fucking bureaucrats...</i>

01:36:34.736 --> 01:36:36.033
<i>... only look at pictures of.</i>

01:36:36.204 --> 01:36:39.503
So don't you dare tell me
I am not fucking thinking straight!

01:36:41.610 --> 01:36:43.271
This is not working, all right?

01:36:43.445 --> 01:36:45.504
<i>It's not working. I'm out.</i>

01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:47.671
Ferris?

01:36:47.849 --> 01:36:49.840
Ferris?

01:36:53.121 --> 01:36:55.146
I should pack.

01:37:13.675 --> 01:37:15.734
Fuck.

01:37:21.282 --> 01:37:22.874
Fuck!

01:37:42.237 --> 01:37:43.795
Shit!

01:37:44.472 --> 01:37:46.463
Move the fucking car!

01:38:54.175 --> 01:38:55.904
- Where's Marwan? Marwan?
- Mr. Ferris.

01:38:56.077 --> 01:38:57.635
Please.

01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:01.844
Please, please.
I just need a moment of his time, all right?

01:39:02.016 --> 01:39:03.813
Okay.

01:39:09.524 --> 01:39:11.048
Please?

01:39:12.794 --> 01:39:14.728
Please excuse me.

01:39:21.603 --> 01:39:23.366
What is it?

01:39:29.644 --> 01:39:32.670
I invented Omar Sadiki.

01:39:32.847 --> 01:39:36.010
It was my operation.
He is not a jihadist, all right?

01:39:36.184 --> 01:39:40.280
I moved him around, I moved money around,
and then I lost him.

01:39:40.455 --> 01:39:42.855
- That is impossible.
- Why?

01:39:43.024 --> 01:39:47.085
Because it will mean that you sat
in my office and you lied to my face.

01:39:47.262 --> 01:39:51.062
Hani, I promise I will share
all the information with you, all right?

01:39:51.232 --> 01:39:54.565
But they have kidnapped a friend of mine
in order to get to me.

01:39:54.736 --> 01:39:57.136
Now, you know exactly
who I'm talking about, Hani.

01:39:57.305 --> 01:40:00.741
Please, they're gonna execute her,
all right?

01:40:00.909 --> 01:40:03.377
Please, help me broker a deal, her for me.

01:40:03.545 --> 01:40:05.513
You lied to me.

01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:07.147
I will not help you.

01:40:07.315 --> 01:40:09.613
- The answer is no.
- Please, Hani.

01:40:09.784 --> 01:40:12.252
Hani. Hani!

01:40:30.905 --> 01:40:32.338
Ed.

01:40:32.507 --> 01:40:35.476
You should've told me about the girl.
We could've watched her.

01:40:35.643 --> 01:40:37.543
They left the phone.
I know how this goes.

01:40:37.712 --> 01:40:39.839
They've got Aisha
and they want someone.

01:40:40.014 --> 01:40:43.780
- If she's alive.
- She has to be alive, right?

01:40:44.252 --> 01:40:47.346
Well, she's probably alive.
At least, they want you to think so.

01:40:47.522 --> 01:40:49.717
- That's the good part.
- And what's the bad part?

01:40:49.891 --> 01:40:51.358
They know about you.

01:40:51.526 --> 01:40:54.654
They know you work for the agency.
That tells me two things.

01:40:54.829 --> 01:40:57.354
One, the people that have Aisha
are running the show...

01:40:57.532 --> 01:40:59.056
...so they're close to Al-Saleem.

01:40:59.234 --> 01:41:02.294
Two, they have learned enough
from Aisha to know she's your pal.

01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:04.438
- She's been interrogated.
- Goddamn it.

01:41:04.606 --> 01:41:07.006
- You cannot take this to Hani, right?
- Right. Right.

01:41:07.175 --> 01:41:10.770
- Does that mean you already have?
- Yes. Yes, sir, I have.

01:41:10.945 --> 01:41:11.969
Why would you do that?

01:41:12.146 --> 01:41:14.046
I have to trust everyone I can right now.

01:41:14.215 --> 01:41:16.615
All you gotta do is trust me.

01:41:17.151 --> 01:41:18.584
- What'd he say?
- He said, <i>"Ma'alesh."</i>

01:41:18.753 --> 01:41:20.721
Because I lied to him,
he's not gonna help.

01:41:28.596 --> 01:41:30.996
Okay. We set this up,
we're gonna do it right.

01:41:31.165 --> 01:41:34.225
- It's not just about you and your girlfriend.
- All right.

01:41:36.504 --> 01:41:40.304
This is Roger Ferris.
Will you put Aisha on the phone?

01:41:40.475 --> 01:41:43.308
<i>Okay, mister. Thanks God you are calling.</i>

01:41:43.478 --> 01:41:46.811
<i>I have a question</i>
<i>to make sure you are you. Please.</i>

01:41:46.981 --> 01:41:48.005
Fine.

01:41:48.182 --> 01:41:50.412
<i>Where do you meet Miss Aisha first time?</i>

01:41:50.585 --> 01:41:55.181
<i>At a medical clinic in Amman.</i>
<i>She's a nurse.</i>

01:41:55.356 --> 01:41:58.291
<i>Where do you take Miss Aisha</i>
<i>for dinner first time?</i>

01:41:58.459 --> 01:42:00.256
Go, go.

01:42:00.461 --> 01:42:01.792
Uh...

01:42:01.963 --> 01:42:05.899
I didn't. She invited me
to her apartment for dinner.

01:42:06.067 --> 01:42:07.557
<i>Did you bring anything?</i>

01:42:09.304 --> 01:42:11.033
<i>I did.</i>

01:42:11.839 --> 01:42:14.603
A dessert pastry.

01:42:14.776 --> 01:42:17.870
<i>If you want to see Miss Aisha,</i>
<i>you must go where I say.</i>

01:42:18.513 --> 01:42:22.472
<i>Trade you for her.</i>
<i>No trick or Miss Aisha will die.</i>

01:42:22.650 --> 01:42:24.242
Tell me where I'm to go.

01:42:24.719 --> 01:42:26.277
<i>I'll tell you where to go.</i>

01:42:26.454 --> 01:42:29.389
<i>It is near the border. Highway 15.</i>

01:42:29.557 --> 01:42:32.583
<i>Between Al-Saidi and Mahbrouk.</i>

01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:34.591
<i>That's where you go. Bye.</i>

01:43:12.867 --> 01:43:14.232
Passport.

01:45:06.747 --> 01:45:07.941
Bring up Pacman feed.

01:45:08.116 --> 01:45:09.845
Increase magnification eight time.

01:45:10.017 --> 01:45:12.076
Eight-time mag.

01:45:13.121 --> 01:45:14.281
Enhance resolution.

01:45:31.973 --> 01:45:35.431
Holding at mid-altitude orbit, 12,500...

01:45:44.852 --> 01:45:46.752
<i>Still holding for vector angle.</i>

01:45:57.932 --> 01:46:00.628
Still holding for vector angle.
- Switching over to SAR.

01:46:23.324 --> 01:46:25.121
Which one do you want us to follow?

01:46:29.463 --> 01:46:30.930
Which one, sir?

01:46:32.233 --> 01:46:34.326
<i>Sir?</i>

01:46:34.502 --> 01:46:36.493
Sorry, buddy.

01:48:06.127 --> 01:48:09.528
Salaam, CIA.

01:48:13.901 --> 01:48:15.391
I am not the sheik.

01:48:15.569 --> 01:48:18.936
The sheik, God praise him,
is the sheik who always was.

01:48:19.106 --> 01:48:20.903
I am his servant.

01:48:22.810 --> 01:48:25.040
Where is the girl?

01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:27.541
Either you're trying to be clever...

01:48:27.715 --> 01:48:31.845
...or someone has done to you
what you so often do to them.

01:48:32.019 --> 01:48:33.850
Lie.

01:48:34.588 --> 01:48:36.920
So you paid for me? Hm?

01:48:37.091 --> 01:48:38.718
Not as much as I would have.

01:48:39.327 --> 01:48:42.626
Such a bargain for such a catch as you.

01:48:42.797 --> 01:48:47.234
Well, it wasn't a bargain, because
no one's gonna negotiate with you for me.

01:48:47.401 --> 01:48:51.167
That's not our policy. There will be
no exchanges. You understand that, right?

01:48:51.339 --> 01:48:54.968
There will be no negotiation,
but not because you say so.

01:48:55.776 --> 01:48:58.472
I have an agent of the CIA.

01:48:59.046 --> 01:49:03.483
And that's what I came to see.
And that's what matters.

01:49:04.885 --> 01:49:06.147
In this world...

01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:11.417
...there's enough poverty and frustration
and anger and passion.

01:49:11.592 --> 01:49:14.356
There will never be a shortage of martyrs.

01:49:15.129 --> 01:49:18.758
Just like these men, huh?
These men who are dispensable to you.

01:49:18.933 --> 01:49:22.334
These men who blow themselves up
in the name of Allah...

01:49:22.503 --> 01:49:25.028
...who kill their own
brothers and sisters, huh?

01:49:25.206 --> 01:49:29.199
There is no place in the Koran for
the murder of innocent people and suicide.

01:49:29.377 --> 01:49:31.504
- You know that.
- It's a good try.

01:49:31.946 --> 01:49:36.610
But the Koran's sayings...
You speak Arabic, no?

01:49:47.194 --> 01:49:51.130
So you misinterpret the one book
you believe in, hm?

01:49:51.565 --> 01:49:53.157
But are you pure...

01:49:53.334 --> 01:49:57.771
...or are you just as corrupt as the capitalist
Westerners that you despise?

01:49:57.938 --> 01:50:00.031
To me, you are fucking slaves.

01:50:00.207 --> 01:50:04.268
You're slaves to the Saudi oil sheiks
and the Wahabi oil money that funds you.

01:50:04.445 --> 01:50:06.572
And when that oil money runs out,
my friends...

01:50:06.747 --> 01:50:10.877
...you will all fucking disappear
into the ashes of history.

01:50:11.051 --> 01:50:14.111
I am not going to torture you, Mr. Ferris.

01:50:14.288 --> 01:50:18.554
I see you're not going to read
what is prepared for you on paper.

01:50:18.726 --> 01:50:19.750
It's all right.

01:50:20.494 --> 01:50:24.260
All I need from you, I already have.

01:50:24.432 --> 01:50:26.957
You know what that camera is for?

01:50:27.535 --> 01:50:31.096
It's not for this. This...
This is intermission.

01:50:31.772 --> 01:50:37.574
It's for what comes after this.
For what comes now.

01:50:47.087 --> 01:50:48.520
Kareem.

01:50:49.423 --> 01:50:51.414
But you paid who for me?

01:50:51.592 --> 01:50:54.288
An intermediary who works for who?

01:50:54.462 --> 01:50:57.022
You don't know who
and that should concern you.

01:50:57.198 --> 01:51:00.258
- Do I look concerned?
- Well, that's what surprises me.

01:51:00.434 --> 01:51:02.698
I thought you were
a lot smarter than that.

01:51:03.370 --> 01:51:06.965
Someone has betrayed you.

01:51:07.141 --> 01:51:09.575
He works for the head
of Jordanian Intelligence...

01:51:09.743 --> 01:51:11.506
...which means he works for us...

01:51:11.679 --> 01:51:17.709
...which means...
Which means you work for us.

01:51:19.854 --> 01:51:22.982
I work for you.

01:51:34.101 --> 01:51:35.159
Are you comfortable?

01:51:35.870 --> 01:51:37.735
Can I make you...

01:51:37.905 --> 01:51:40.305
...more comfortable?

01:51:46.447 --> 01:51:49.245
I'm not lying to you, Kareem.
I'm not lying to you.

01:51:50.284 --> 01:51:53.913
We know... We know where you are!

01:51:55.189 --> 01:51:57.214
Where am I?

01:51:57.391 --> 01:52:00.360
You... You... You are in the light.

01:52:00.528 --> 01:52:03.429
The light is on you. Look at it.

01:52:04.498 --> 01:52:06.329
No, no, no.

01:52:06.500 --> 01:52:10.197
The light...
The light is on you, motherfucker.

01:52:15.509 --> 01:52:18.000
What do you think is happening here,
Mr. Ferris?

01:52:18.178 --> 01:52:20.646
Do you think the cavalry
is coming for you?

01:52:21.782 --> 01:52:23.545
Let's wait.

01:52:25.653 --> 01:52:28.247
Nobody's coming for you.

01:52:28.422 --> 01:52:30.515
Welcome to Guantanamo.

01:52:33.494 --> 01:52:35.724
God! Fuck!

01:53:18.472 --> 01:53:20.167
MAN

01:53:41.528 --> 01:53:42.586
MAN:

01:54:24.872 --> 01:54:25.964
MEN:

01:55:05.312 --> 01:55:06.336
MARWAN:

01:55:29.603 --> 01:55:31.594
You can tell who cares
about you the most...

01:55:31.772 --> 01:55:34.673
...by who comes first
to visit you in the hospital.

01:55:34.842 --> 01:55:37.402
And I believe I am the first.

01:55:37.578 --> 01:55:40.240
That is not difficult,
because nobody knows where you are.

01:55:40.414 --> 01:55:41.972
Yeah.

01:55:42.149 --> 01:55:44.140
And where am I, Hani?

01:55:44.318 --> 01:55:46.377
You're home, in Amman.

01:55:48.889 --> 01:55:53.724
So it was your man I spoke to
on the phone...

01:55:54.628 --> 01:55:57.654
...your men who took Aisha...

01:55:57.831 --> 01:56:00.527
...your men who dropped me off
in the desert.

01:56:00.701 --> 01:56:03.727
I was of some assistance, I admit.

01:56:03.904 --> 01:56:07.670
But it was not me
that picked you up in the desert.

01:56:07.841 --> 01:56:09.365
Edward could not find you.

01:56:09.943 --> 01:56:13.538
Not with all his aircraft, all his people,
all his money...

01:56:13.714 --> 01:56:16.342
...and joie de vivre.

01:56:16.517 --> 01:56:18.747
So how, I wonder, did I do it?

01:56:18.919 --> 01:56:22.377
- Karami.
- Very good. You remember him?

01:56:22.556 --> 01:56:27.118
Yes, I remember him, Hani.
He was in the fucking room with me.

01:56:27.294 --> 01:56:31.094
He was in the room
because I put him there.

01:56:31.265 --> 01:56:33.699
I'm just sorry
I wasn't there a few minutes sooner.

01:56:33.867 --> 01:56:37.359
Right. What would've happened
if you were a few minutes later, Hani?

01:56:37.538 --> 01:56:40.234
- Then I shudder to think.
- No, I shudder to think.

01:56:42.176 --> 01:56:45.577
How badly did you hurt Aisha
when you took her, huh?

01:56:45.746 --> 01:56:48.271
- That's what I wanna know.
- Aisha, not at all.

01:56:49.449 --> 01:56:52.043
The room we messed up
after we took her.

01:56:52.219 --> 01:56:53.948
Bullshit, Hani, bullshit!

01:56:54.121 --> 01:56:57.090
All right. We tested that blood! All right?
It was hers!

01:56:57.257 --> 01:56:59.885
She is a nurse.
She gives blood every month.

01:57:00.060 --> 01:57:02.585
Now, please, let go of the jacket.
Thank you.

01:57:04.731 --> 01:57:08.098
You're trying to tell me
you didn't tell her, Hani?

01:57:08.268 --> 01:57:11.499
I told her what I could,
which I admit was not very much...

01:57:11.672 --> 01:57:14.072
...because these are matters
of state security.

01:57:14.241 --> 01:57:16.505
So she doesn't know anything
about what happened?

01:57:16.677 --> 01:57:19.669
She knows what everybody
who knows me knows.

01:57:19.847 --> 01:57:23.874
That I am an exceedingly polite gentleman
and a very good conversationalist.

01:57:24.051 --> 01:57:25.518
Huh.

01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:29.289
If I may be so fucking impolite, Hani...

01:57:29.456 --> 01:57:32.084
...I almost died in that goddamn room.

01:57:32.259 --> 01:57:35.888
And if you had died,
I would have told her what you did for her.

01:57:36.063 --> 01:57:40.261
And she...
She would have loved you forever.

01:57:40.934 --> 01:57:44.301
Whereas now you are going
to have to earn that right.

01:57:44.972 --> 01:57:47.463
That's great news.

01:57:49.943 --> 01:57:51.968
Fantastic work, Hani.

01:57:52.145 --> 01:57:54.170
Really. Excellent.

01:57:55.182 --> 01:57:57.343
So you now have Al-Saleem, right?

01:57:58.185 --> 01:58:00.050
That was the plan, my dear.

01:58:01.855 --> 01:58:05.552
And I presume he's not giving you
any information.

01:58:05.726 --> 01:58:07.284
Not yet.

01:58:19.273 --> 01:58:21.400
Your work's done here, buddy.

01:58:21.842 --> 01:58:24.242
You're gonna come back.
I got you a corner office...

01:58:24.411 --> 01:58:26.538
...just down the hall from mine.

01:58:26.713 --> 01:58:29.978
As soon as I get the guy who's in it
out of it, it's all yours.

01:58:30.150 --> 01:58:32.380
More money, a fancy title.

01:58:32.552 --> 01:58:36.352
No sunscreen, no couscous,
unless you really want it.

01:58:36.523 --> 01:58:40.254
- Right down the hall from you, huh, Ed?
- Right down the hall from me.

01:58:40.427 --> 01:58:44.523
Well, I think we both know you'd be
more comfortable without me there.

01:58:45.265 --> 01:58:48.200
Now, don't think about it too long,
because I'll take that as a slight.

01:58:48.368 --> 01:58:49.767
Hm.

01:58:49.937 --> 01:58:54.499
Besides, what else are you gonna do?
Stay here?

01:58:54.675 --> 01:58:57.701
Maybe for a little while, huh?
I mean, why wouldn't I?

01:58:57.878 --> 01:58:59.903
Why would you?

01:59:00.180 --> 01:59:02.239
What if I like the Middle East?

01:59:03.784 --> 01:59:07.584
Ain't nobody likes the Middle East, buddy.
There's nothing here to like.

01:59:08.055 --> 01:59:09.613
Hmm.

01:59:10.023 --> 01:59:13.117
Well, maybe that's the problem right there,
isn't it, Ed?

01:59:14.628 --> 01:59:15.993
Hm.

01:59:16.330 --> 01:59:18.355
Oh, buddy, buddy, buddy.

01:59:18.532 --> 01:59:22.696
You know, you're the best I got.

01:59:22.869 --> 01:59:24.598
And you know it hurts me to say that.

01:59:27.607 --> 01:59:30.667
Good luck on winning this war, Ed.

01:59:30.844 --> 01:59:34.575
I hope everyone thinks
you did it all by yourself, huh?

01:59:39.886 --> 01:59:41.786
You're not safe here.

01:59:41.955 --> 01:59:43.718
I'm not safe anywhere.

01:59:43.890 --> 01:59:45.983
You walk out on me,
you know what that means.

01:59:46.159 --> 01:59:48.059
What does that mean?

01:59:49.129 --> 01:59:51.063
That means you're giving up
on America.

01:59:51.732 --> 01:59:55.327
Just be careful calling yourself
America, huh, Ed?

01:59:56.203 --> 02:00:00.867
Listen, you have a safe flight home.
Say hey to the wife and kids.

02:00:01.041 --> 02:00:03.441
Nobody's innocent in this shit, Ferris.

02:01:23.423 --> 02:01:24.447
<i>What's he doing?</i>

02:01:24.624 --> 02:01:26.353
<i>Nothing. Buying vegetables.</i>

02:01:27.494 --> 02:01:30.395
<i>What about us, sir?</i>
<i>What do you want us to do?</i>

02:01:30.564 --> 02:01:32.156
<i>Are we staying with him?</i>

02:01:32.332 --> 02:01:35.199
No. Buddy's done.

02:01:35.368 --> 02:01:36.926
He's all by himself.

02:01:37.104 --> 02:01:40.471
<i>Copy that. Cleared off target.</i>

02:08:12.799 --> 02:08:14.790
