(clapping)

01:39.249 --> 01:40.082
(sucking lips)

01:40.082 --> 01:43.875
- Aye, she clapping for you,
you ain't gonna say nothing?

01:43.875 --> 01:44.708
(speaking in foreign language)

01:44.708 --> 01:46.530
- Don't gotta say nothing to me,

01:46.530 --> 01:48.263
I'm here to show good behavior.

01:49.460 --> 01:52.757
She can be stuck up all she want to.

01:52.757 --> 01:57.140
(speaking in foreign language)

01:57.140 --> 01:58.756
- What did she say?

01:58.756 --> 02:00.806
- She said, "She don't know me, I crazy."

02:02.154 --> 02:02.987
(chuckling)

02:02.987 --> 02:06.023
- Well hey, at least you
look the part, right?

02:07.040 --> 02:09.170
- Y'all better stop messing with her,

02:09.170 --> 02:11.270
she gonna send all y'all to hell.

02:11.270 --> 02:14.963
- Hey, the jokes on her, we already here.

02:15.892 --> 02:16.725
- That's right.
- If she can do that

02:16.725 --> 02:17.590
- she definitely needs to go see

02:17.590 --> 02:20.513
my baby daddy, he needs
to go straight to hell.

02:21.474 --> 02:22.708
- Who shine?

02:22.708 --> 02:23.541
- [Mya] Okay.

02:23.541 --> 02:24.458
- Ha, yeah.

02:26.640 --> 02:27.473
- Hey, ladies.
- But I was trying

02:27.473 --> 02:29.500
to tell her
- My name is Shantel Cross,

02:29.500 --> 02:30.334
and I...

02:30.334 --> 02:31.167
- [Mya] Better than that.

02:31.167 --> 02:32.360
- 'cause I need her hair done like that.

02:32.360 --> 02:37.203
- Excuse me, ladies, please,
excuse me, ladies, please.

02:38.147 --> 02:39.891
- You gonna have to do better than that.

02:39.891 --> 02:42.380
- Yeah, we had a good time.
- Can I have your attention?

02:42.380 --> 02:43.213
Please!

02:44.210 --> 02:45.043
Thank you.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.273
My name is Shan--

02:47.273 --> 02:52.273
- Shantel, I can read,
where they get you from?

02:52.450 --> 02:54.500
- Well, I'm originally from Pulaski.

02:54.500 --> 02:57.290
- My cousin Poochie from
there, you know him?

02:57.290 --> 02:59.920
- No, I don't.

02:59.920 --> 03:02.150
- Does she look like she
know any of your cousins?

03:02.150 --> 03:04.193
Poochie, Luchi, or Gucci?

03:05.449 --> 03:07.280
- [Tonya] Shut up.

03:07.280 --> 03:08.400
- You got kids?

03:08.400 --> 03:10.450
- Yes, I have two boys.

03:10.450 --> 03:12.620
- Ah, I got two boys too.

03:12.620 --> 03:14.320
- She ain't seen 'em in two years.

03:15.830 --> 03:17.393
- Tonya! Really?

03:18.930 --> 03:20.180
- What, Lisa?

03:20.180 --> 03:22.380
The girl got a mattress full of bed bugs,

03:22.380 --> 03:24.510
she's got tracks all over her arms,

03:24.510 --> 03:28.000
and she's serving a 10 year sentence, ah.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.060
- So you're just gonna put
her business out like that.

03:30.060 --> 03:31.760
- I'm just keeping it real.

03:31.760 --> 03:33.630
So, what?

03:33.630 --> 03:36.110
I guess you're gonna tell
her God loves her too?

03:36.110 --> 03:37.842
- Yes, He does.

03:37.842 --> 03:38.854
- Pssh.

03:38.854 --> 03:40.830
- Well, he sure loves you.

03:40.830 --> 03:43.067
You all educated and sanctified looking.

03:43.067 --> 03:45.790
- And a sinner saved by grace.

03:45.790 --> 03:47.300
You just see the cover of this book,

03:47.300 --> 03:48.630
you don't know the story.

03:48.630 --> 03:50.600
- Your story can't be all that bad.

03:50.600 --> 03:54.000
- The only difference
between all of you and me

03:54.000 --> 03:55.909
is that I didn't get caught.

03:55.909 --> 03:56.742
- Shut up!

03:57.670 --> 03:58.503
- You?

03:58.503 --> 04:00.637
Nah, I don't believe that.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.030
- Don't let these clothes fool you.

04:09.350 --> 04:10.367
- No way.

04:10.367 --> 04:12.600
- You ain't even about that life.

04:12.600 --> 04:17.460
- No, not anymore, I'm about His life.

04:17.460 --> 04:21.470
Jesus' way of life, He's
teaching me to walk every day.

04:21.470 --> 04:23.793
He is the way, the truth, and the life.

04:25.210 --> 04:27.500
- So what exactly was you doing?

04:27.500 --> 04:29.930
- Okay, for starters, I've been clean

04:29.930 --> 04:32.904
for 19 years from crack cocaine.

04:32.904 --> 04:33.737
- Crack,

04:33.737 --> 04:35.434
crack,
- What, crack?

04:35.434 --> 04:36.340
- crack?
- Uh-uh.

04:36.340 --> 04:38.370
- No.
- Yeah, me.

04:38.370 --> 04:41.460
- Miss Stuck Up used to be a crackhead.

04:41.460 --> 04:44.310
- Nah, (speaking in foreign
language), I don't see it.

04:44.310 --> 04:46.160
- I used to be one of
those people who said

04:46.160 --> 04:49.570
I would never do this
and that, and eventually

04:49.570 --> 04:53.800
I found myself doing things
that I said I would never do.

04:53.800 --> 04:56.460
I lived in a small
town, I loved attention,

04:56.460 --> 04:57.996
and did things to get it.

04:57.996 --> 05:00.585
And I'm afraid it's what
started me to having parties

05:00.585 --> 05:01.910
in which attracted trouble

05:01.910 --> 05:02.990
of all sorts.
- Hello?

05:02.990 --> 05:07.143
- Yes, I'm Ms. Dixon, I would
like to report my neighbor.

05:07.143 --> 05:08.640
(upbeat hip-hop music)

05:08.640 --> 05:12.250
Yes, she's having loud
music, and having gangsters

05:12.250 --> 05:13.920
all over her house.

05:13.920 --> 05:17.693
I think she's selling
drugs and doing the coke.

05:19.070 --> 05:21.423
Oh, okay, you'll send some officers out?

05:22.700 --> 05:26.227
Thank you so much, God bless you.

05:28.194 --> 05:30.810
- [Woman] Oh, hey!
- [Man] It's good up in here!

05:30.810 --> 05:32.943
- [Woman] I know it,
hey, where the party at?

05:32.943 --> 05:34.147
(upbeat hip-hop music)

05:34.147 --> 05:36.730
(all cheering)

05:42.872 --> 05:43.705
- [Shantel] We're not doing that,

05:43.705 --> 05:45.554
you do not care to be my daddy.

05:45.554 --> 05:47.039
- [Thomas] I thought I was your daddy.

05:47.039 --> 05:49.207
- [Shantel] You are, you're my big daddy.

05:49.207 --> 05:50.657
- [Chris] I like that.

05:50.657 --> 05:51.490
Don't keep me waiting, now.

05:51.490 --> 05:52.450
(phone ringing)

05:52.450 --> 05:56.370
- All right, hello, hello?

05:56.370 --> 05:58.050
Hold on a second, I can't hear you.

05:58.050 --> 06:00.156
Hey, turn the music
down, I'm on the phone.

06:00.156 --> 06:00.989
- What?

06:00.989 --> 06:02.778
- Renee, turn the music
down, I'm on the phone.

06:02.778 --> 06:04.350
- Well, get off the phone.

06:04.350 --> 06:06.850
- Renee, turn the music
down or the party is over.

06:13.420 --> 06:15.280
- You happy, Your Majesty.

06:15.280 --> 06:16.173
- Love you.

06:17.340 --> 06:18.820
Wait, what?

06:18.820 --> 06:20.020
- What took you so long?

06:21.300 --> 06:23.350
- Sorry, Renee was playing
the music really loud

06:23.350 --> 06:25.381
and I couldn't hear you.

06:25.381 --> 06:27.140
- Old crazy Renee, huh?

06:27.140 --> 06:28.780
So how my girl been doing?

06:28.780 --> 06:29.960
- Oh, so now I'm your girl, huh?

06:29.960 --> 06:32.300
- You always gonna be my girl.

06:32.300 --> 06:36.261
Listen, I've been up in there
thinking some things through

06:36.261 --> 06:38.573
and one thing that's for sure is you.

06:39.684 --> 06:41.284
Look, Shantel, I need you, baby.

06:42.890 --> 06:46.650
- Well I couldn't tell, you
know, with how we left off.

06:46.650 --> 06:48.543
- Listen, look, I'm a changed man.

06:49.810 --> 06:52.463
- Well, it's a little too
late for that now, Terrance.

06:53.340 --> 06:54.969
I've moved on.

06:54.969 --> 06:56.505
- Moved on, with who?

06:56.505 --> 06:58.100
- That's none of your business.

06:58.100 --> 06:58.933
(scoffing)

06:58.933 --> 07:01.834
- Look, please don't tell me
it's Can't Get Right Thomas.

07:01.834 --> 07:04.330
(laughing)

07:04.330 --> 07:06.920
Listen, I got breaking news for you, baby,

07:06.920 --> 07:08.320
that ain't even real.

07:08.320 --> 07:09.830
We real!

07:09.830 --> 07:10.800
Now say it.

07:10.800 --> 07:12.002
- Say what?

07:12.002 --> 07:13.159
- We real!

07:13.159 --> 07:14.473
- That's stupid.

07:14.473 --> 07:17.070
- Uh-huh, I'm waiting.

07:17.070 --> 07:18.800
- Whatever, we're real.

07:18.800 --> 07:21.180
- Yeah, that's my girl.

07:21.180 --> 07:22.523
- You need anything?

07:22.523 --> 07:23.702
- Yeah.

07:23.702 --> 07:25.200
But nothing you can
give me over the phone.

07:25.200 --> 07:27.143
- Eh, Terrance!

07:28.670 --> 07:31.640
Well, you know when you
get out I'm all yours.

07:31.640 --> 07:33.440
- Yeah, you better be.

07:33.440 --> 07:35.270
- [Shantel] I miss you.

07:35.270 --> 07:37.420
- Yeah, I know, I gotta go.

07:37.420 --> 07:40.220
- Okay, I love you, T.

07:40.220 --> 07:41.610
- Yeah, you better.

07:41.610 --> 07:42.806
- [Shantel] What?

07:42.806 --> 07:44.386
- What?

07:44.386 --> 07:45.219
(laughing)

07:45.219 --> 07:46.780
Look, I'm just playing with you.

07:46.780 --> 07:48.948
I love you too, I gotta go.

07:48.948 --> 07:51.781
(people chatting)

07:55.286 --> 07:57.474
- Let's crank this party back up in here!

07:57.474 --> 08:00.057
(all cheering)

08:01.859 --> 08:04.460
(upbeat hip-hop music)

08:04.460 --> 08:08.291
- Jesus, oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho,

08:08.291 --> 08:10.330
I thought you were supposed
to be showing me something?

08:10.330 --> 08:13.103
- Sorry, but that show has been canceled.

08:13.103 --> 08:14.635
- What?

08:14.635 --> 08:15.980
- I could still show you
the door if you want?

08:15.980 --> 08:17.030
- Oh, it's like that?

08:18.540 --> 08:20.400
Was that T on the phone?

08:20.400 --> 08:23.170
So we been kicking it all this
time, but as soon as he call

08:23.170 --> 08:24.940

08:24.940 --> 08:25.940
- Us?

08:25.940 --> 08:27.040
Sweetie, sorry to break it to you,

08:27.040 --> 08:28.683
but there never was an us.

08:29.890 --> 08:31.117
- Look, you ain't gonna just lead me on

08:31.117 --> 08:34.090
and just play me like that.
- You better let go of my arm!

08:34.090 --> 08:36.440
- [Renee] You better let
go of my sister's arm!

08:36.440 --> 08:37.273
- Or what?

08:38.291 --> 08:39.124
(gun clicking)

08:39.124 --> 08:39.957
- Or me.

08:41.732 --> 08:44.332
Hey, you know you need to
get up off my sister, cuz.

08:48.080 --> 08:48.950
- Big man with the gun, huh?

08:48.950 --> 08:52.393
- Nah, more like big brother
looking out for little sister.

08:52.393 --> 08:53.883
Now you need to roll.

08:58.050 --> 09:00.468
- Shantel, don't you call me again.

09:00.468 --> 09:01.301
- Bye.

09:03.110 --> 09:04.820
- [Thomas] You better watch your back.

09:04.820 --> 09:06.230
- How 'bout I put a couple in yours

09:06.230 --> 09:07.980
if you ain't out the door in three?

09:09.870 --> 09:10.720
- Get out my way.

09:16.890 --> 09:17.900
- Look, you gotta stop

09:17.900 --> 09:19.730
leading these fools on like that, sis.

09:19.730 --> 09:20.920
- Look, it's fine, he all right.

09:20.920 --> 09:21.753
- Nah, for real, for real,

09:21.753 --> 09:23.130
they don't be playing around
like that, stop doing--

09:23.130 --> 09:25.380
- Look, Ray, it's fine, I
didn't ask you to save me

09:25.380 --> 09:26.483
in the first place!

09:26.483 --> 09:29.310
- All right, let's get
this party back going.

09:29.310 --> 09:30.676
- Yay!
- Yeah!

09:30.676 --> 09:33.412
- It's definitely!
- Come on, come on.

09:33.412 --> 09:35.632
(all screaming)

09:35.632 --> 09:38.132
(gun blaring)

09:39.107 --> 09:40.994
(children crying)

09:40.994 --> 09:42.179
(tires squealing)

09:42.179 --> 09:45.096
(people screaming)

09:49.280 --> 09:52.574
- [Shantel] It's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

09:52.574 --> 09:53.746
- Freeze!

09:53.746 --> 09:55.334
- Man, how'd y'all get here so fast?

09:55.334 --> 09:58.251
(people screaming)

10:02.225 --> 10:04.765
- What's gonna happen to Ray?

10:04.765 --> 10:06.270
- I don't know.

10:06.270 --> 10:08.080
- It was self-defense.

10:08.080 --> 10:09.600
He was protecting us, right?

10:09.600 --> 10:12.550
- Of course he was, but they're
not gonna see it like that.

10:14.600 --> 10:16.860
- This is all so crazy!

10:16.860 --> 10:18.938
I mean, Curt told me right, he--

10:18.938 --> 10:20.855
- Mm-mm, don't do that.

10:22.830 --> 10:25.040
- Hey, should we pray?

10:25.040 --> 10:26.140
- Pray?

10:26.140 --> 10:29.180
- Yeah, yeah, we should pray.

10:29.180 --> 10:30.093
Ne, you pray.

10:31.025 --> 10:32.383
- Shantel, you know I don't know how--

10:32.383 --> 10:34.453
- Well try, I need you to try, come on.

10:43.680 --> 10:44.623
- Hey, God.

10:46.850 --> 10:47.693
How you doing?

10:48.752 --> 10:51.620
(clearing throat)

10:51.620 --> 10:53.853
Can you please watch over my brother?

10:56.550 --> 11:01.550
He did save us, so, that means
he did something good, right?

11:03.990 --> 11:06.290
Please make sure the
police don't beat him up.

11:07.310 --> 11:08.143
Amen.

11:08.982 --> 11:10.182
- You have to say Jesus.

11:11.290 --> 11:12.123
- What?

11:12.123 --> 11:12.956
- Say Jesus, Renee.

11:14.890 --> 11:16.283
- Amen, Jesus.

11:19.882 --> 11:22.799
(knocking on door)

11:30.780 --> 11:32.280
- [Mrs. Peterson] Mrs. Taylor?

11:32.280 --> 11:33.390
- [Shantel] Yeah.

11:33.390 --> 11:35.810
- [Mrs. Peterson] I'm Mrs. Peterson.

11:35.810 --> 11:36.643
- [Shantel] Why do I care?

11:36.643 --> 11:37.930
- [Mrs. Peterson] May I come in?

11:37.930 --> 11:40.930
(suspenseful music)

11:47.043 --> 11:48.819
- What, where is he going?

11:48.819 --> 11:49.652
What, where is he go--

11:49.652 --> 11:50.485
- Excuse me, Ms. Taylor.

11:50.485 --> 11:53.130
- Mrs. Taylor, I am here
because your children

11:53.130 --> 11:55.210
was in an unsafe environment

11:55.210 --> 11:57.420
that had a devastating development occur.

11:57.420 --> 11:59.280
- Unsafe, devastating?

11:59.280 --> 12:01.470
- Yes, very unsafe, Mrs. Taylor.

12:01.470 --> 12:04.420
The police reported the
usage of drug paraphernalia

12:04.420 --> 12:06.740
and gunshots, that type of environment

12:06.740 --> 12:08.530
is extremely unsafe for your children.

12:08.530 --> 12:09.865
- Yo, who the hell is this woman?

12:09.865 --> 12:10.698
- [Renee] Calm down.

12:10.698 --> 12:13.230
- Mrs. Taylor, that's what
I'm trying to tell you!

12:13.230 --> 12:15.500
You've been relinquished
custody of your children.

12:15.500 --> 12:16.621
- Relinquished?

12:16.621 --> 12:18.163
- [Child] Mama, mama!

12:18.163 --> 12:18.996
- Oh my God,

12:18.996 --> 12:20.300

- Get away from me!

12:20.300 --> 12:21.262
Get him off!

12:23.055 --> 12:23.888
(all clamoring)

12:23.888 --> 12:24.721
- Look, ma'am.

12:24.721 --> 12:26.107
- Ms. Taylor, let go.
- Let go of him!

12:26.107 --> 12:27.485
Let go of him!
- Ms. Taylor.

12:27.485 --> 12:30.792
Ms. Taylor.
- We'll get him back.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.065
- Ms. Taylor.
- Come on, baby.

12:32.065 --> 12:32.898
- [Officer] Ms. Taylor,

12:32.898 --> 12:35.742
Ms. Taylor.
- No, let go of him!

12:35.742 --> 12:36.575
Get off of me,

12:36.575 --> 12:37.735
you can't do this!
- Settle down.

12:37.735 --> 12:40.540
- No, this woman crazy, think
she about to take my kids.

12:40.540 --> 12:41.373
Get off of me,

12:41.373 --> 12:44.347
y'all can't do this to me.
- Ms. Taylor!

12:44.347 --> 12:45.730
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Taylor,

12:45.730 --> 12:46.860
but their father has been notified.

12:46.860 --> 12:49.870
- I don't care who you
called, go out there

12:49.870 --> 12:51.070
and bring my kids back!

12:51.070 --> 12:53.560
- How you gonna take her kids away,

12:53.560 --> 12:54.824
what kinda monsters are you?

12:54.824 --> 12:56.872
Right in front of her face, really?

12:56.872 --> 12:57.705
(groaning)

12:57.705 --> 12:59.530
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Taylor,
but they have been put

12:59.530 --> 13:01.626
in the custody of their
new legal guardian.

13:01.626 --> 13:03.151
- Legal, my guardian, my--

13:03.151 --> 13:04.156
- [Officer] Mrs. Taylor.

13:04.156 --> 13:06.545
- I'm their legal guardian,
I care about them.

13:06.545 --> 13:09.889
They're mine, they're mine, don't go, no!

13:09.889 --> 13:11.806
No, no, I'm right here!

13:12.981 --> 13:14.819
No, let go of me.
- Stop.

13:14.819 --> 13:16.360
It's okay.
- Let go of me.

13:16.360 --> 13:17.880
- [Renee] You're okay,

13:17.880 --> 13:19.205
we're gonna work this out.

13:19.205 --> 13:20.145
- [Kira] Stop, we're gonna

13:20.145 --> 13:22.466
figure this out.
- No, not my kids!

13:22.466 --> 13:24.850
I can't believe they
took them from me, me,

13:24.850 --> 13:28.220
their mom, and they didn't even tell me.

13:28.220 --> 13:31.153
And Ray, Ray's in jail.

13:36.077 --> 13:37.493
(phone ringing)

13:37.493 --> 13:38.326
- [Chris] Who dis?

13:38.326 --> 13:39.159
- Who dis?

13:39.159 --> 13:41.260
The mother of your kids, that's who.

13:41.260 --> 13:42.890
- Oh, this the woman who
almost got my kids shot?

13:42.890 --> 13:44.450
- [Shantel] I didn't, I...

13:44.450 --> 13:45.283
Look, are they all right?

13:45.283 --> 13:46.608
- Yeah, they fine now.

13:46.608 --> 13:47.850
- Let me speak to them.
- Can I speak to mama?

13:47.850 --> 13:48.850
- No, they don't wanna talk to you.

13:48.850 --> 13:50.020
- [Child] Can I speak to mom?

13:50.020 --> 13:52.180
- Man, y'all shut up and go to your rooms!

13:52.180 --> 13:54.610
- Baby, it's all right, mommy's here.

13:54.610 --> 13:56.460
- Look, I've been appointed custody,

13:56.460 --> 14:00.020
so I'm gonna do what you
couldn't, take care of my kids.

14:00.020 --> 14:02.670
- Look, I am more than capable
of taking care of my kids.

14:02.670 --> 14:03.625
You can't do--

14:03.625 --> 14:04.458
(phone clicking)

14:04.458 --> 14:06.300
Hello? Hello?

14:06.300 --> 14:09.520
Chris, Chris, Chris, pick up the phone.

14:09.520 --> 14:10.549
Chris, you can't do me--

14:10.549 --> 14:11.382

14:12.430 --> 14:14.500

14:14.500 --> 14:15.333

14:15.333 --> 14:17.013
- Hang up the phone.

14:17.920 --> 14:18.753
Now.

14:25.130 --> 14:26.880
Shay, come in here and sit with us.

14:32.290 --> 14:33.460

14:35.090 --> 14:35.973
Just sit down.

14:43.250 --> 14:47.090
- Look, girl, you need
to hit some of this.

14:47.090 --> 14:47.923
- What is it?

14:47.923 --> 14:50.150
- It's just a laced blunt.

14:50.150 --> 14:51.223
- What is it laced with?

14:51.223 --> 14:54.330
- It's laced with the
good good, powder, girl.

14:54.330 --> 14:56.103
- Powder? Like cocaine?

14:56.970 --> 14:58.433
- Look, you need to forget.

14:59.300 --> 15:00.450
All right?

15:00.450 --> 15:02.340
This will help you do that.

15:02.340 --> 15:03.970
- How can I forget?

15:03.970 --> 15:04.803
- You will.

15:05.826 --> 15:07.120
- [Kira] Mm-hmm.

15:07.120 --> 15:08.210
- Just take a couple puffs,

15:08.210 --> 15:09.043
come on.
- Come on, come on.

15:09.043 --> 15:11.321
(soft music)

15:18.830 --> 15:19.663
- Is that it?

15:21.460 --> 15:23.880
- First of all, you need to do it again,

15:23.880 --> 15:28.500
and this time do it for

15:28.500 --> 15:31.183
Come on, it's the good

(coughing)

15:36.732 --> 15:39.315
(all laughing)

15:45.352 --> 15:47.484
Ooh, I think she likes it.

15:47.484 --> 15:48.920
- Mm-hmm, uh-huh.

15:48.920 --> 15:49.753
- You know what?

15:49.753 --> 15:52.653
How 'bout we leave her
with a bag over here?

15:53.830 --> 15:55.533
She need to get through all this,

15:55.533 --> 15:56.707
this gonna help her.

15:58.887 --> 16:01.554
- [Renee] She like that feeling.

16:03.830 --> 16:08.240
- This feeling, I need this feeling.

16:32.285 --> 16:34.368
(crying)

16:54.974 --> 16:57.391
(soft music)

17:30.143 --> 17:32.393
(coughing)

18:45.689 --> 18:48.439
(dramatic music)

19:24.865 --> 19:27.532
(phone ringing)

19:29.960 --> 19:31.470
Hello?

19:31.470 --> 19:33.020
- Hey girl, how you holding up?

19:34.170 --> 19:36.150
- I'm surviving.

19:36.150 --> 19:36.983
- I hear that.

19:40.070 --> 19:42.630
Please tell me you ain't smoked
up all that stuff already?

19:42.630 --> 19:44.230
- I couldn't help it.

19:44.230 --> 19:46.103
- Wow, all of it, huh?

19:48.449 --> 19:50.140
- That baby daddy of yours,
did he have a problem

19:50.140 --> 19:52.570
with you staying out late last night?

19:52.570 --> 19:56.650
- No, but he was getting onto
me about hanging around you.

19:56.650 --> 19:59.500
I'm like, you just want
me to dis my sister?

19:59.500 --> 20:00.770
- What he say?

20:00.770 --> 20:04.377
- Girl, he was like,
"She'll be all right."

20:04.377 --> 20:06.247
"She's trouble for you right now."

20:07.190 --> 20:08.950
- Hater, he just mad

20:08.950 --> 20:10.630
because he can't have as much fun as you

20:10.630 --> 20:12.210
working that third shift job.

20:12.210 --> 20:13.503
- I know, right?

20:14.630 --> 20:17.533
He has such a bad attitude sometimes.

20:19.420 --> 20:22.643
So, when you plan on
throwing another party?

20:24.260 --> 20:28.160
- I don't know, the place
barely survived the last one.

20:28.160 --> 20:30.810
Plus, I plan to go see my boo today.

20:30.810 --> 20:32.480
I really need to see him.

20:32.480 --> 20:34.070
- Who? Terrance?

20:34.070 --> 20:35.650
Girl, stop!

20:35.650 --> 20:37.430
- No, I'm serious.

20:37.430 --> 20:38.530
I know he's doing a little time,

20:38.530 --> 20:40.810
but I'm a ride or die
chick, so you already know.

20:40.810 --> 20:41.963
- Y'all crazy.

20:42.880 --> 20:44.280
Why are you taking him back?

20:45.200 --> 20:46.600
What did he do to you?

20:46.600 --> 20:50.370
- We connected or something,
I can't really explain it.

20:50.370 --> 20:54.600
But, he told me he loved
me yesterday on the phone.

20:54.600 --> 20:56.870
- That's why that dude flipped out on you,

20:56.870 --> 20:59.390
when you got off the phone, mm-hmm.

20:59.390 --> 21:02.710
- [Curt] Renee, I thought
you made something to eat.

21:02.710 --> 21:04.060
- Look in the refrigerator.

21:05.767 --> 21:07.100
- [Curt] I don't see it.

21:07.100 --> 21:09.720
- On the bottom shelf in the back, stupid.

21:11.393 --> 21:14.039
- [Curt] Is this supposed to be greens?

21:14.039 --> 21:14.960
(sighing)

21:14.960 --> 21:16.221
- Girl, let me get off this phone

21:16.221 --> 21:18.708
before this man eat something
that is gonna kill him.

21:18.708 --> 21:19.740
(chuckling)

21:19.740 --> 21:21.008
- You should let him.

21:21.008 --> 21:21.841
- Ooh.

21:21.841 --> 21:23.104
- [Shantel] All right, talk to you laters.

21:23.104 --> 21:24.208
- All right.

21:24.208 --> 21:25.041
- [Shantel] See you.

21:25.041 --> 21:26.041
- Okay, bye.

21:27.325 --> 21:29.492
(sighing)

21:31.847 --> 21:34.514
(phone ringing)

21:38.840 --> 21:39.673
- I accept.

21:41.920 --> 21:43.546
- What's up, gorgeous?

21:43.546 --> 21:44.951
- I'm good.

21:44.951 --> 21:46.190
- That's good to hear.

21:46.190 --> 21:48.530
I'm glad you came to
visit me the other day.

21:48.530 --> 21:50.670
- You were looking real good.

21:50.670 --> 21:53.540
- Look, aye, slow down,
don't get me excited, now.

21:53.540 --> 21:54.373
I miss you too.

21:56.832 --> 21:58.440
But Shantel, I got
something I need to ask you.

21:58.440 --> 21:59.960
- What is it, T?

21:59.960 --> 22:01.045
- You love me?

22:01.045 --> 22:02.220
- [Shantel] What?

22:02.220 --> 22:03.280
- Do you love me?

22:03.280 --> 22:05.980
- [Shantel] You know I do,
Terrance, why you ask that?

22:07.970 --> 22:08.803
- Well prove it.

22:09.905 --> 22:10.738
Marry me.

22:10.738 --> 22:12.190
- What?

22:12.190 --> 22:13.023
How?

22:13.023 --> 22:14.440
- We can get married in here.

22:14.440 --> 22:15.440
- [Shantel] Are you serious?

22:15.440 --> 22:16.860
- Yeah, this weekend.

22:16.860 --> 22:17.743
- This weekend?

22:19.140 --> 22:20.280
Isn't that a little...

22:20.280 --> 22:22.390
- [Terrance] Look, do you love me?

22:22.390 --> 22:23.430
- Yes, but...

22:23.430 --> 22:25.170
- Ain't no buts to it, Shantel.

22:25.170 --> 22:27.370
Listen, I told you, I'm
a changed man, baby.

22:28.400 --> 22:29.970
And I'm serious.

22:29.970 --> 22:32.503
Listen, we real and we work.

22:38.820 --> 22:40.170
Yes.

22:40.170 --> 22:42.221
Yes, Terrance, I'll marry you.

22:42.221 --> 22:44.170

you marrying my brother.

But just remember, in
case something goes down

23:16.270 --> 23:19.930

- Yo, where you going?

24:07.290 --> 24:09.079

24:26.220 --> 24:28.579

24:31.030 --> 24:33.762
How you get outta jail anyway?

24:33.762 --> 24:35.507
- You know they can't hold me down.

24:35.507 --> 24:37.301
It was self-defense.

24:37.301 --> 24:39.070

24:39.070 --> 24:41.593
- Yeah, for possession of a weapon.

24:42.680 --> 24:44.220

24:44.220 --> 24:45.721
- I got another one.

24:45.721 --> 24:48.160

You know he got them defective
gun fresh off the boat.

24:52.853 --> 24:55.983
Oh no, man, you think
I'm a end up like Thomas?

24:55.983 --> 24:57.691

I was calling you because--

27:52.800 --> 27:54.380
- What is it, Slick?

27:54.380 --> 27:56.320
- I may have let something over there,

27:56.320 --> 27:57.810
did you come across it?

27:57.810 --> 27:59.473
- What, Slick?

27:59.473 --> 28:00.306
- You know.

28:00.306 --> 28:02.520
- Slick, spit it out.

28:02.520 --> 28:04.620
- I may have left some product over there,

28:05.506 --> 28:06.729
you come across it?

28:06.729 --> 28:07.562
- No.

28:08.485 --> 28:09.900
- That musta been one
heck of a conversation

28:09.900 --> 28:10.910
you was having with Chris.

28:10.910 --> 28:12.070

28:49.280 --> 28:50.610
- I did, ain't nobody answered.

28:50.610 --> 28:52.260

Help me lift this chair up.

29:06.880 --> 29:08.770
Shoot, where is it?

29:08.770 --> 29:09.993
- Where is what?

29:11.600 --> 29:12.433
- Kitchen.

29:21.320 --> 29:24.170
- Look, I don't know what's
going on with you sis, but...

29:25.020 --> 29:26.820
Oh my God, this kitchen's a mess!

29:26.820 --> 29:28.360

29:28.360 --> 29:31.293
- For real, you doing that now, sis?

29:32.290 --> 29:34.065
Look, this little habit
of yours is starting

29:34.065 --> 29:34.898
to get a little--

29:34.898 --> 29:35.731
- Is what?

29:35.731 --> 29:36.564
This little habit is what?

29:36.564 --> 29:38.790
Holding me together right now.

29:38.790 --> 29:41.613
- Look, I'm just worried about you, sis.

29:43.050 --> 29:45.300
- How 'bout you stop worrying, Ray?

29:45.300 --> 29:46.720
I'm 'bout sick of you, okay.

29:46.720 --> 29:51.230
My kids are gone, my income is gone,

29:51.230 --> 29:54.233
my fiance is in prison and I'm alone.

29:55.470 --> 29:57.113
I feel so alone, Ray.

29:58.510 --> 30:02.227
- Look, you're not alone,
I got your back, sis,

30:03.080 --> 30:04.513
and I always will.

30:05.711 --> 30:06.544
You know that, right?

30:06.544 --> 30:07.650
(soft music)

30:07.650 --> 30:08.723
- Yeah, I know.

30:08.723 --> 30:11.053
I'm sorry, Ray, I love you.

30:12.159 --> 30:15.047
- Look, I should be apologizing to you,

30:16.179 --> 30:17.920
I feel like this is
all my fault, you know?

30:17.920 --> 30:18.753
If I woulda just--

30:18.753 --> 30:20.953
- I'm getting married tomorrow, Ray.

31:43.830 --> 31:46.710
their faith to each
other, I now pronounce you

31:46.710 --> 31:49.713
husband and wife, you may kiss your bride.

31:52.213 --> 31:54.463
(clapping)

31:59.436 --> 32:01.853
(soft music)

32:05.720 --> 32:08.440
- So, how does it feel to be a new bride?

32:08.440 --> 32:11.650

like a void has been filled.

32:11.650 --> 32:13.080
- Yes.

32:13.080 --> 32:14.270
What's wrong with you, Renee?

32:14.270 --> 32:16.113
Why you looking like that?

32:17.980 --> 32:19.933
- Look, it's been fun,

32:20.927 --> 32:22.830
but I can't hang around you two anymore.

32:22.830 --> 32:24.690
- Can't or don't want to?

32:24.690 --> 32:26.713
- It's not like that Shay, it's not.

32:29.580 --> 32:33.470
Curt keeps saying how you two
are a bad influence on me.

32:33.470 --> 32:35.410
- We're a bad influence on you?

32:35.410 --> 32:36.243
Really?

32:36.243 --> 32:38.840
- Well, I only wanna do those
things when I'm with y'all.

32:38.840 --> 32:41.800
When I'm with him it's not like that.

32:41.800 --> 32:43.440
- You're joking, right?

32:43.440 --> 32:45.420
Girl, this is just your way of hating.

32:45.420 --> 32:46.253
- Hating?

32:46.253 --> 32:48.960
- Yes, Shay is married
now, and guess what?

32:48.960 --> 32:50.000
You're not.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.580
- This has nothing to do with it.

32:51.580 --> 32:52.413
- [Kira] Oh really?

32:52.413 --> 32:54.773
- I could care less about her
little locked up marriage.

32:54.773 --> 32:55.940
- Ah!

32:55.940 --> 33:00.293
- Thing is, I'm moving outta
state, and I'm glad now.

33:01.730 --> 33:04.190
I don't need to be around a
bunch of hood rats anyway.

33:04.190 --> 33:05.507
- Girl, I will smack the taste out--

33:05.507 --> 33:07.620
- Chill, Kira, it's okay.

33:07.620 --> 33:09.310
'Cause see, it's my wedding day.

33:09.310 --> 33:11.230
And I'm not gonna be
pulled down to your level.

33:11.230 --> 33:12.200
You know why?

33:12.200 --> 33:14.845
'Cause see, I's married now!

33:14.845 --> 33:17.151
(both laughing)

33:17.151 --> 33:17.993
Married!

33:17.993 --> 33:19.241
(both laughing)

33:19.241 --> 33:20.960
She trying to talk about me.
- Yes, girl.

33:20.960 --> 33:23.208
I know, is she talking
about us? I was tripping.

33:23.208 --> 33:26.550
I don't know why I was
tripping. (soft music)

33:27.600 --> 33:28.593
- Yeah, you are.

33:31.073 --> 33:31.906
Bye Shay.

33:35.021 --> 33:37.188
I'm really gonna miss you.

33:42.770 --> 33:44.780
- I didn't know you could
get married in prisons,

33:44.780 --> 33:46.650
when we get outta here I'm calling Hector.

33:46.650 --> 33:50.610
- Yeah, disturb him, while
he's with his side chick.

33:50.610 --> 33:52.790
- Don't talk about Hector
like that, he's a good man.

33:52.790 --> 33:55.400
- I'm just saying, I don't trust him.

33:55.400 --> 33:58.250
- And I'm just saying, he
may not be your favorite,

33:58.250 --> 34:01.370
but he's mine, and we're
going to be married.

34:01.370 --> 34:02.435
- Good luck with that

34:02.435 --> 34:03.268
(speaking in foreign language)

34:03.268 --> 34:06.250
- What, he's definitely
not Papi Pablo, huh?

34:06.250 --> 34:08.635
- You know, marriage ain't
all it's cracked up to be.

34:08.635 --> 34:10.495
(scoffing)

34:10.495 --> 34:12.970
- I don't know, I like the idea

34:12.970 --> 34:15.870
of two people finding each other.

34:15.870 --> 34:19.360
Guess I'm just a hopeless
romantic that way.

34:19.360 --> 34:21.440
- Did it help with the loneliness

34:21.440 --> 34:22.870
even though he was locked up?

34:22.870 --> 34:26.040
- It was a temporary happiness
knowing I had a husband.

34:26.040 --> 34:28.270
He also sent money to hold me off.

34:28.270 --> 34:29.300
- How?

34:29.300 --> 34:30.740
- He was running the block at the time

34:30.740 --> 34:33.460
so he still had people making drops.

34:33.460 --> 34:35.880
- This just gets better and better.

34:35.880 --> 34:37.450
- Seems like you got a little judgment

34:37.450 --> 34:39.140
in your tone, Mya.

34:39.140 --> 34:41.560
- Yeah, I picked up on that too.

34:41.560 --> 34:44.170
- No judgment, I'm just saying.

34:44.170 --> 34:46.320
- It's fine, I'm used to it,

34:46.320 --> 34:47.963
Jesus had to pull me through it.

34:49.080 --> 34:50.800
- Jesus did that for you?

34:50.800 --> 34:53.620
- You mean this change you see now?

34:53.620 --> 34:55.200
Yes.

34:55.200 --> 34:56.550
- How?

34:56.550 --> 34:59.810
I tried God, He didn't work for me.

34:59.810 --> 35:01.790
And it really pisses
me off when people say

35:01.790 --> 35:03.340
Jesus did this and that.

35:03.340 --> 35:05.720
- And don't forget, "Won't He do it?"

35:05.720 --> 35:07.670
- Yeah, I know, right.

35:07.670 --> 35:09.740
Know, He won't.

35:09.740 --> 35:14.740
- Whoa, looks like finally
Ms. Muffinen coming into

35:15.090 --> 35:16.500
her true colors.

35:16.500 --> 35:17.697
- Shut up, Tonya.

35:17.697 --> 35:19.530
(laughing)

35:19.530 --> 35:22.410
- Woo, hoo-hoo, she bites.

35:22.410 --> 35:25.530
- You better watch
yourself, she on a rampage.

35:25.530 --> 35:29.410
- All right, ladies, look,
Mya, I'm only telling you

35:29.410 --> 35:32.690
how He helped me and opened
my eyes to deception.

35:32.690 --> 35:33.670
- Deception?

35:33.670 --> 35:36.470
- Yes, deception, it's also a drug

35:36.470 --> 35:38.340
that we can become addicted to.

35:38.340 --> 35:41.340
For example, you'll believe
a lie over the truth

35:41.340 --> 35:42.930
even when you know the truth.

35:42.930 --> 35:45.470
- Yeah, like Hector is a good man.

35:45.470 --> 35:48.080
- Shut up, Lisa, you leave him outta this!

35:48.080 --> 35:51.490
- I'm just saying, I think
you're deceiving yourself

35:51.490 --> 35:53.760
and you know it, he's no good.

35:53.760 --> 35:55.020
- Well, I was deceived by people

35:55.020 --> 35:57.100
that call themself Christians.

35:57.100 --> 35:59.610
- Have you ever been deceived by men?

35:59.610 --> 36:01.530
- Yeah, of course.

36:01.530 --> 36:02.880
What young girl hasn't?

36:02.880 --> 36:04.900
- And do you still like men?

36:04.900 --> 36:07.464
- If not, you know you can come see me.

36:07.464 --> 36:10.170
(sucking lips)

36:10.170 --> 36:11.003
- [Mya] Yeah.

36:11.970 --> 36:15.180
- And you still give
them chance after chance.

36:15.180 --> 36:16.930
- Yeah, but I'm more aware now

36:16.930 --> 36:19.420
on who's running game and what's real.

36:19.420 --> 36:21.420
- And that's the same thing with God,

36:21.420 --> 36:24.070
transfer that awareness,
and you'll know what's real.

36:24.960 --> 36:27.330
Sad to say there are those out there

36:27.330 --> 36:28.670
who try and take advantage.

36:28.670 --> 36:31.683
But, there are also those
out there who are true.

36:32.730 --> 36:36.370
Unfortunately for me, I was
deceiving myself at that age.

36:36.370 --> 36:39.803
Drugs were a God to me and
it was only getting worse.

37:17.730 --> 37:21.643
- So, I told him, don't have
my baby around that girl.

37:22.520 --> 37:25.610
She is too disrespectful
and I don't like her.

37:25.610 --> 37:27.750
He always claiming he's not with her,

37:27.750 --> 37:29.333
but he's over there every day.

37:30.320 --> 37:32.732
You know what I'm talking about, girl?

37:32.732 --> 37:35.093
Shantel, Shantel, what's wrong?

37:35.988 --> 37:37.241
- Can't you see it?

37:37.241 --> 37:38.074
- [Kira] See what?

37:38.074 --> 37:39.453
- My skin.

37:39.453 --> 37:41.710
- Your skin, is there something on it?

37:41.710 --> 37:43.310
- No, it's not there, it's gone!

37:44.150 --> 37:45.323
- [Kira] What is gone?

37:46.960 --> 37:49.974
- Turn the car around,
turn the car around now!

37:49.974 --> 37:53.910
- Shantel, you are
tripping, you are tripping.

37:53.910 --> 37:56.713
- I can't make it come
back, it's not a dream.

37:57.610 --> 38:00.660
Take me home, take me home now, I'm dying!

38:00.660 --> 38:01.493
- You're dying?

38:01.493 --> 38:02.650
Shay, what are you talking?

38:02.650 --> 38:04.970
You're scaring me, what's wrong with you?

38:04.970 --> 38:07.640
Please tell me, what
are you talking about?

38:07.640 --> 38:08.667
- [Shantel] Call my brother.

38:08.667 --> 38:09.500
- [Kira] What?

38:09.500 --> 38:11.403
- Call my brother, I'm dying!

38:12.709 --> 38:14.876
(gasping)

38:15.980 --> 38:18.081
(whimpering)

38:18.081 --> 38:19.994
(dramatic music)

38:19.994 --> 38:22.161
(panting)

38:36.789 --> 38:39.039
(coughing)

39:01.620 --> 39:03.613
- Hey, hey you, is this yours?

39:07.920 --> 39:08.903
- You can keep it.

39:12.290 --> 39:13.290
- Do you know Slick?

39:15.100 --> 39:16.083
- Excuse me?

39:17.200 --> 39:18.754
- You know him?

39:18.754 --> 39:19.587
- Edie!

39:20.880 --> 39:23.210
You opted out of the
program, you are well aware

39:23.210 --> 39:25.204
that you need to leave the premises.

39:25.204 --> 39:27.220
- I was just asking her for some gum.

39:27.220 --> 39:29.850
You think you know everything,
Ms. Tina, but you don't.

39:29.850 --> 39:31.750
Wasn't I just asking you for some gum?

39:33.780 --> 39:34.653
- Leave!

39:41.868 --> 39:43.530
(sighing)

39:43.530 --> 39:46.360
I'm sorry you had to witness that Shantel.

39:46.360 --> 39:48.153
Everybody isn't ready to change.

39:51.700 --> 39:53.860
Well, I need to go to the back

39:53.860 --> 39:55.360
to get the rest of your paperwork together

39:55.360 --> 39:57.943
and make sure your space is ready for you.

39:59.260 --> 40:00.860
I'll be back to get you shortly.

40:01.890 --> 40:04.150
- Ms. Tina, is it?

40:04.150 --> 40:04.983
- [Tina] Yes.

40:06.080 --> 40:08.370
- I don't think I'm a drug addict.

40:08.370 --> 40:13.240
I mean, sure, I do smoke,
but, I'm nothing like that.

40:15.120 --> 40:19.010
- I see, why don't you
read those pamphlets

40:19.010 --> 40:20.870
and decide for yourself?

40:20.870 --> 40:23.390
The treatment is completely optional.

40:23.390 --> 40:24.223
- Okay.

40:28.477 --> 40:29.730
"Why are you a drug addict?"

40:29.730 --> 40:31.493
I don't know, you tell me.

40:33.467 --> 40:35.627
"If you answer yes to
any of these questions

40:35.627 --> 40:36.787
"you are an addict."

40:37.890 --> 40:38.723
Okay.

40:41.777 --> 40:44.290
"Do you do drugs alone?"

40:44.290 --> 40:45.303
Not all the time.

40:47.357 --> 40:49.859
"Have you ever lied or stolen for drugs?"

40:49.859 --> 40:51.923
Of course, how else am I gonna get it.

40:53.927 --> 40:58.027
"Are doing drugs effecting
your life's happiness?"

40:59.430 --> 41:02.203
I don't know, I can't feel
anything when I'm on them.

41:03.857 --> 41:06.007
"Is doing drugs making you careless

41:06.007 --> 41:08.007
"about your family's welfare?"

41:15.780 --> 41:17.470
I mean, I know I haven't
been a good mother,

41:17.470 --> 41:19.320
but does that mean I'm a drug addict?

41:28.180 --> 41:29.470
- Hey!

41:29.470 --> 41:31.414
- Girl, you better go
on, they gonna catch you.

41:31.414 --> 41:33.689
- Do you know Slick?

41:33.689 --> 41:34.573
(whimsical music)

41:34.573 --> 41:37.490
(roommate snoring)

42:19.117 --> 42:21.784
(hip-hop music)

42:31.380 --> 42:32.580
- Got a package for you.

42:34.280 --> 42:35.830
- Thanks for coming through for me.

42:35.830 --> 42:37.110
- No doubt.

42:37.110 --> 42:38.630
But doesn't that defeat the purpose?

42:38.630 --> 42:40.100
- Look, you don't understand, okay?

42:40.100 --> 42:42.370
The food's bad, these females crazy.

42:42.370 --> 42:44.260
My roommate snores, and I'm
trying to fight the urge

42:44.260 --> 42:46.283
not to smother her in her sleep.

42:47.546 --> 42:50.090
By the way, I met a fan of yours in here.

42:50.090 --> 42:52.783
- I'm pretty sure you'll
meet a lotta my fans in here.

42:53.950 --> 42:55.465
- You know Amy?

42:55.465 --> 42:56.876
- What?

42:56.876 --> 43:00.430
- Amy, that's her name,
she was asking about you.

43:00.430 --> 43:01.373
- Schizo Amy?

43:03.840 --> 43:05.093
Yeah, I know her.

43:06.756 --> 43:08.256
- I'm sure you do.

43:14.847 --> 43:15.980
- Shantel!

43:15.980 --> 43:16.820
What are you doing?

43:16.820 --> 43:17.934
- Gotta go.

43:17.934 --> 43:18.920
- Aye!

43:18.920 --> 43:21.120
Make sure get me some
business in here, man.

43:48.432 --> 43:50.700
(knocking)

43:50.700 --> 43:51.733
- Yes, come in.

43:54.160 --> 43:57.510
- Hi, Ms. Tina, I hope
I'm not bothering you.

43:57.510 --> 44:00.093
- No, we have an open door policy.

44:03.110 --> 44:04.243
- That's good to know.

44:08.500 --> 44:10.800
I need to tell you something.

44:10.800 --> 44:13.723
- What's going on, are you quitting?

44:19.120 --> 44:21.660
- I got high last night.

44:21.660 --> 44:23.300
- What, last night?

44:23.300 --> 44:25.640
Where, and was anyone with you?

44:25.640 --> 44:26.526
- No.

44:26.526 --> 44:27.480
(scoffing)

44:27.480 --> 44:29.410
- It was that guy you snuck
off to see, wasn't it?

44:29.410 --> 44:32.370
- Look, I'm really sorry,
it was just a slip up.

44:32.370 --> 44:34.770
But I really do wanna finish the program.

44:34.770 --> 44:37.120
- Well you won't be finishing it here.

44:37.120 --> 44:37.993
I can't allow it.

44:39.750 --> 44:42.070
You could've put someone's
life on the line.

44:42.070 --> 44:44.190
- I know, I feel bad.

44:44.190 --> 44:45.163
- You should.

44:46.370 --> 44:47.283
We work hard here.

44:48.240 --> 44:50.853
Some of us used to be addicts too.

44:52.392 --> 44:56.510
We put our names and our own
lives on the line every day

44:56.510 --> 44:59.193
to help those who want to be helped.

45:01.270 --> 45:02.103
I'm sorry.

45:02.103 --> 45:04.620
- Please, please, I'm sorry,
please give me another chance,

45:04.620 --> 45:05.833
I will do anything.

45:08.460 --> 45:12.150
I can't leave here the same way I came in.

45:12.150 --> 45:14.263
If I do I'm going to die.

45:17.030 --> 45:19.263
- All right, all right.

45:20.830 --> 45:22.653
I'm gonna give you one more chance.

45:23.850 --> 45:26.300
But I'm going to place
you on heavy restrictions.

45:28.280 --> 45:29.323
- Heavy what?

45:33.930 --> 45:36.140
- There's no food allowed
in the dorm rooms,

45:36.140 --> 45:38.470
no visitors after 6:00 p.m.

45:38.470 --> 45:41.910
And there will be no tolerance
for any fighting in there,

45:41.910 --> 45:42.950
do you understand?

45:42.950 --> 45:43.783
- Yes, ma'am.

45:43.783 --> 45:46.470
- Oh, did you make your family aware

45:46.470 --> 45:47.660
that you're going to be here?

45:47.660 --> 45:48.493
- Yes, ma'am.

45:48.493 --> 45:49.900
- Okay, one more thing.

45:49.900 --> 45:53.540
If you do not follow these rules,

45:53.540 --> 45:56.083
we will dismiss you immediately!

45:57.406 --> 45:58.239
Okay?

45:58.239 --> 45:59.630
- Yes, ma'am.

45:59.630 --> 46:01.810
- This is your study guide.

46:01.810 --> 46:02.643
- The Bible?

46:03.950 --> 46:07.310
- Is that a little too unfamiliar for you?

46:07.310 --> 46:09.330
- I coulda read a Bible before I got here.

46:09.330 --> 46:10.183
- Well, did you?

46:12.510 --> 46:14.730
- So I'm not gonna be given any NA books

46:14.730 --> 46:16.440
to help me with stepworks.

46:16.440 --> 46:19.280
- Your journey is a little
different from everyone else's.

46:19.280 --> 46:22.550
Your steps come straight from the Bible.

46:22.550 --> 46:27.170
And when we strengthen you,
first, we do it spiritually,

46:27.170 --> 46:28.853
mentally, physically.

46:29.860 --> 46:32.650
And if you need any help, or
don't understand something,

46:32.650 --> 46:35.253
I am here for you, I'll help you.

46:36.430 --> 46:40.267
- The scripture says in Hosea
chapter four verse six that,

46:40.267 --> 46:43.910
"My people are being destroyed
for a lack of knowledge."

46:43.910 --> 46:46.350
That word knowledge is
a very powerful word.

46:46.350 --> 46:50.350
It comes from the word yada, Y-A-D-A.

46:50.350 --> 46:52.620
Which has to do with kinsmenship,

46:52.620 --> 46:55.540
friendship, relationship.

46:55.540 --> 46:57.250
And so, what he's saying
in this scripture,

46:57.250 --> 47:00.860
what he's telling us is
that, in order for us

47:00.860 --> 47:03.600
to have a good life and not be destroyed,

47:03.600 --> 47:06.320
we have to gain wisdom and knowledge.

47:06.320 --> 47:11.320
Knowledge with Him,
relationship, knowing who He is

47:11.367 --> 47:14.173
and the benefits He has for
each and every one of us.

47:15.130 --> 47:17.540
It's time to stop being selfish.

47:17.540 --> 47:19.040
It's time to think about other people

47:19.040 --> 47:22.033
who are depending on us to
make the right decisions.

47:23.810 --> 47:26.870
As a matter of fact, tomorrow
night I'm gonna be speaking

47:26.870 --> 47:29.670
at an event and I wanna
make a personal invitation

47:29.670 --> 47:30.953
to each one of you,

47:30.953 --> 47:33.750
I want you to come and
be my special guests.

47:33.750 --> 47:35.423
It's gonna be an awesome event.

47:36.640 --> 47:40.830
Young lady, God has a
calling on your life.

47:40.830 --> 47:42.020
- What, me?

47:42.020 --> 47:42.853
- [Pastor] Yes, you.

47:42.853 --> 47:43.686
- Who's calling me?

47:43.686 --> 47:44.638
- [Pastor] God's calling you.

47:44.638 --> 47:45.471
(scoffing)

47:45.471 --> 47:47.210
- No, I don't think so.

47:47.210 --> 47:49.860
I'm definitely not someone
Jesus would wanna talk to.

47:49.860 --> 47:51.690
- Well, the thing is,
that's what He wants to do,

47:51.690 --> 47:53.560
He wants to talk to you.

47:53.560 --> 47:57.360
But the key is you being
ready to receive Him.

47:57.360 --> 47:58.320
- Him?

47:58.320 --> 47:59.860
- [Pastor] Yes, Jesus.

47:59.860 --> 48:02.780
- Nah, I don't even know Jesus like that.

48:02.780 --> 48:04.450
I mean, not yet.

48:04.450 --> 48:06.560
- Well, the thing is, He knows you.

48:06.560 --> 48:09.193
And eventually, you're
gonna wanna know Him.

48:10.400 --> 48:13.540
So everybody, I look forward
to seeing y'all tomorrow night.

48:13.540 --> 48:16.190
It's gonna be a awesome time
together, God bless you.

48:23.710 --> 48:27.353
- Young lady, take this seriously,

48:28.440 --> 48:30.290
God has a major calling in your life.

50:13.860 --> 50:15.793

50:46.774 --> 50:48.947
the spirit of the Lord
is on you right now.

50:50.161 --> 50:52.620
The spirit of the Lord
is up on you right now.

50:52.620 --> 50:55.413
This is the transformation
you've been praying for.

50:56.330 --> 50:59.220
This is what your
family's been praying for.

50:59.220 --> 51:01.363
This is the moment you've cried about.

51:02.730 --> 51:07.210
Cried out to God and you
asked God to bring this season

51:07.210 --> 51:10.650
into your life, and this
is your season right now.

51:10.650 --> 51:13.283
Chains are being broken
off of you right now.

51:14.150 --> 51:17.340
Generational curses are being
broken off of you right now.

51:17.340 --> 51:22.252
This is your season, this is
your moment for a turnaround.

51:22.252 --> 51:27.099
God has arrested this moment
for you to have victory.

51:27.099 --> 51:32.099
For you to have freedom, for
you to walk into your destiny,

51:32.106 --> 51:33.798
your God given destiny!

51:33.798 --> 51:36.541
Give Him praise right now,
everybody, lift up your hands

51:36.541 --> 51:37.778
and bless His name.

51:37.778 --> 51:38.611
- Thank you, Jesus.

51:38.611 --> 51:39.634
- [Pastor] Celebrate
for my sister right now.

51:39.634 --> 51:40.750
- [Shantel] Thank you!

51:40.750 --> 51:44.530
- Receive, receive blessings.

51:44.530 --> 51:47.366
Receive right now in Jesus' name.

51:47.366 --> 51:50.150
Devil I dare you to touch my sister again.

51:50.150 --> 51:52.888
I rebuke you in the name of Jesus.

51:52.888 --> 51:55.940
Loose my sister and set her free.

51:55.940 --> 51:57.460
Loose her from her past.

51:57.460 --> 52:01.950
God, I pray that You would
propel her into her future.

52:01.950 --> 52:04.234
Into her God given destiny.

52:04.234 --> 52:07.330
There won't be no hex, no curse,

52:07.330 --> 52:08.527
no nothing that will keep you

52:08.527 --> 52:12.540
from walking into what God
has called you to walk into.

52:12.540 --> 52:15.433
Rejoice with my sister one more time.

52:17.475 --> 52:21.725
- Thank you, Jesus, thank
you Jesus for everything.

52:23.447 --> 52:25.302
- I don't know how this
work, but Freda can't wait

52:25.302 --> 52:26.135
to get outta here.

52:26.135 --> 52:27.242
- Me too.

52:27.242 --> 52:28.583
- We need to go get our nails done.

52:28.583 --> 52:29.611
- Yes!

52:29.611 --> 52:30.569
- You ain't lying.
- That's what we need to do.

52:30.569 --> 52:32.236
- That'd be awesome.

52:33.616 --> 52:34.850
- What in the hell?
- What in the hell?

52:34.850 --> 52:37.467
- What?
- In the world.

52:37.467 --> 52:38.798
- You know what?

52:38.798 --> 52:39.704
She always doing something.

52:39.704 --> 52:42.121
- I don't know, I ain't even.

52:44.612 --> 52:45.445
- Jessica.

52:46.522 --> 52:47.355
- What?

52:47.355 --> 52:48.970
- I got the Holy Ghost.

52:48.970 --> 52:50.410
- The Holy Ghost? Great.

52:50.410 --> 52:52.167
- No, I went to Bible study last night,

52:52.167 --> 52:54.620
it was so awesome and so amazing.

52:54.620 --> 52:55.927
Oh my God!

52:55.927 --> 52:58.260
(screaming)

53:02.600 --> 53:04.507
Tammy, I got the Holy Ghost!

53:04.507 --> 53:06.840
(screaming)

53:13.857 --> 53:15.104
I got the Holy Ghost!

53:15.104 --> 53:17.437
(screaming)

53:25.169 --> 53:26.819
Pat, I got the Holy Ghost!

53:26.819 --> 53:29.152
(squealing)

53:37.338 --> 53:41.150
- Hey, Shantel, we have pizza,
are you coming to join us?

53:41.150 --> 53:42.790
- Oh, no thanks.

53:42.790 --> 53:46.680
- Anything wrong, I haven't
seen you eat for days, girl?

53:46.680 --> 53:50.710
- I'm eating, it's just
a different type of food.

53:50.710 --> 53:53.340
- Oh, okay, well, I'm not going to argue

53:53.340 --> 53:54.783
with a woman on a mission.

53:55.900 --> 53:56.900
- [Girl] Y'all crazy.

53:56.900 --> 53:58.125
I'm gonna do
- Excuse me,

53:58.125 --> 53:59.327
excuse me.
- what I wanna do!

53:59.327 --> 54:01.592
- Girl, put this shirt back on!

54:01.592 --> 54:05.683
Don't you take this off young
lady, and stop it, stop it!

54:11.370 --> 54:12.730
- I think you're doing a great job

54:12.730 --> 54:15.150
in Spiritual Developmental Courses.

54:15.150 --> 54:17.710
So, we would like to know how you feel

54:17.710 --> 54:19.852
about teaching others the Word of God?

54:19.852 --> 54:22.110
(laughing)

54:22.110 --> 54:22.943
- Me?

54:22.943 --> 54:24.520
Oh, God, no, no.

54:24.520 --> 54:25.603
Lord, not me.

54:26.550 --> 54:27.600
- Why not you?

54:27.600 --> 54:28.490
- Why not me?

54:28.490 --> 54:29.730
How can I teach people how to live

54:29.730 --> 54:31.293
when I'm still in rehab?

54:32.710 --> 54:35.560
- I cannot deny that there's
a calling on your life.

54:35.560 --> 54:38.710
And I cannot deny what the
Spirit has led me to tell you,

54:38.710 --> 54:39.793
and that's teaching.

54:40.730 --> 54:44.730
- I done grew up around arguing,
fighting, cussing, killing.

54:44.730 --> 54:46.900
I've seen mothers sell their furniture

54:46.900 --> 54:50.023
and their kid's toys just
to get high and by, okay?

54:50.023 --> 54:52.820
I don't know nothing about no preaching.

54:52.820 --> 54:56.173
- What you just said
right there will preach.

54:57.680 --> 55:00.535
Look, just sleep on it awhile.

55:00.535 --> 55:01.490
(soft music)

55:01.490 --> 55:05.493
Also there's a Bible
verse, Ephesians 1:17-19,

55:06.330 --> 55:07.680
I want you to meditate on it.

55:07.680 --> 55:08.810
- What's it about?

55:08.810 --> 55:12.173
- Study it, and then you
come back and tell me.

55:13.120 --> 55:16.083
In the meantime, think about my offer.

55:17.090 --> 55:18.670
- All right.

55:18.670 --> 55:21.270
- Don't be afraid of the
calling on your life.

55:21.270 --> 55:23.393
You have a strong testimony.

55:25.130 --> 55:28.763
Just think of how many
people, women, you will help.

55:37.170 --> 55:39.280
Just remember, you can't hang around

55:39.280 --> 55:40.933
with the same bad influences.

55:41.870 --> 55:45.347
- Funny, someone told
me the exact same thing.

55:45.347 --> 55:47.930
(all laughing)

55:49.580 --> 55:53.430
- You should be proud, you
came from a long, difficult,

55:53.430 --> 55:55.530
and a very hard place.

55:55.530 --> 55:58.466
So now you can make something
good out of yourself!

55:58.466 --> 55:59.957
- Yes, girl!

55:59.957 --> 56:01.683
Thank you Ms. Margaret.

56:03.076 --> 56:05.743
(all screaming)

56:07.763 --> 56:12.526
I'll still see you.

56:12.526 --> 56:13.359
Kira!

56:14.526 --> 56:15.359
- Hey.

56:16.252 --> 56:17.085
- What you?

56:17.085 --> 56:18.834
Girl, here, take my bag, come on now.

56:18.834 --> 56:19.667
Ah ha!

56:21.339 --> 56:24.006
(hip-hop music)

56:27.010 --> 56:29.630
- Look, just because
you decided to get clean

56:29.630 --> 56:31.430
it doesn't mean I'm gonna get clean.

56:32.410 --> 56:35.833
I'm just saying, I'm not
gonna stop smoking, I'm not.

56:39.350 --> 56:40.583
What is so funny?

56:42.150 --> 56:43.860
- Nothing, nothing's funny.

56:47.160 --> 56:50.103
Thanks for picking me up,
I really appreciate it.

56:51.160 --> 56:52.953
Thanks for being a really good friend.

56:53.930 --> 56:54.780

57:30.290 --> 57:32.640
And I want her to come and
share from the Word of the Lord,

57:32.640 --> 57:36.922
would y'all please make some
noise and celebrate my sis,

57:36.922 --> 57:39.095
Shantel as she comes to minister today.

57:39.095 --> 57:43.345
(audience cheering and applauding)

57:46.060 --> 57:47.543
- Amen, amen.

57:52.120 --> 57:54.510
Hallelujah, is there
anyone else who's grateful

57:54.510 --> 57:57.520
that even in my mess God
sees a calling on my life?

57:57.520 --> 57:58.978
That God will still use you?

57:58.978 --> 58:02.290
(audience cheering and applauding)

58:02.290 --> 58:06.770
My name is Shantel Taylor, I
am very unqualified on paper,

58:06.770 --> 58:10.050
but I am so grateful that
God qualifies the called.

58:10.050 --> 58:11.250
And I answered the call.

58:14.070 --> 58:17.630
I feel the power of the Holy
Spirit, I thought it was fear.

58:17.630 --> 58:19.090
But when it says the
Spirit of the Lord is here,

58:19.090 --> 58:19.923
there is liberty.

58:19.923 --> 58:21.920
So right now I'ma give
every demon in this room

58:21.920 --> 58:23.860
five seconds to get out.

58:23.860 --> 58:25.740
Because if I'm getting free that means

58:25.740 --> 58:27.760
everyone connected to
me is getting free too,

58:27.760 --> 58:29.123
so you got five, four,

58:30.800 --> 58:35.309
three, two, one, I'ma
lift up a shout of praise

58:35.309 --> 58:37.810
because if I can get
free from crack cocaine

58:37.810 --> 58:39.460
what can you get free from?

58:39.460 --> 58:41.070
You can get free from free.

58:41.070 --> 58:43.380
You can get free from
lust, you can get free

58:43.380 --> 58:45.520
from drug addiction,
homosex, whatever it is,

58:45.520 --> 58:48.023
if I can get free you
can get free as well.

58:50.053 --> 58:50.886
Holy Spirit.

58:52.543 --> 58:56.660
I'ma hit you real quick with
a wham bam, thank you ma'am.

58:56.660 --> 59:01.660
And get out, I'm speaking
from Mark 5, versus 5-8.

59:01.690 --> 59:04.957
It says, "Day and night he
wandered among the burial caves

59:04.957 --> 59:07.747
"and in the hills howling
and cutting himself

59:07.747 --> 59:09.347
"with sharp stones."

59:09.347 --> 59:13.867
"When Jesus was still some
distance away the man saw him,

59:13.867 --> 59:17.830
"ran to meet him, and
bowed low before him."

59:17.830 --> 59:19.197
The title of my sermon is

59:19.197 --> 59:22.110
"Prepare to Come Out of Dark Places."

59:22.110 --> 59:24.920
Would you bow your heads with me briefly?

59:24.920 --> 59:27.870
Father God, I magnify Your holy name.

59:27.870 --> 59:30.180
Father I lift You up, I also decrease

59:30.180 --> 59:31.840
so that You may increase, Lord.

59:31.840 --> 59:34.370
Please make my tongue a ready sword

59:34.370 --> 59:36.890
to cut against the enemy
and every demonic voice

59:36.890 --> 59:39.560
that is trying to keep
your people in bondage.

59:39.560 --> 59:42.120
I ask that the Holy Spirit
infect this place, Lord,

59:42.120 --> 59:43.440
release the fire of God.

59:43.440 --> 59:45.408
In Jesus name I pray, amen.

59:45.408 --> 59:46.241
- [Congregation] Amen.

59:46.241 --> 59:47.370
- Have you made preparations

59:47.370 --> 59:49.410
to come out of your dark places?

59:49.410 --> 59:53.080
You know, your caves where
you handle your depression,

59:53.080 --> 59:56.030
your isolation, your sadness.

59:56.030 --> 59:58.830
What do your hands touch in your cave?

59:58.830 --> 1:00:01.500
Who do drag in your dark places?

1:00:01.500 --> 1:00:04.970
For me, how I dealt with
my break-ups was finding

1:00:04.970 --> 1:00:06.490
another man to save.

1:00:06.490 --> 1:00:09.950
Oh, but God, he needs
me, I can change him.

1:00:09.950 --> 1:00:12.190
How many of you are looking for projects?

1:00:12.190 --> 1:00:14.240
How many of you are in
ungodly relationships

1:00:14.240 --> 1:00:16.110
simply because that person was available.

1:00:16.110 --> 1:00:18.420
What are you doing in your cave?

1:00:18.420 --> 1:00:20.530
How do you handle your sadness?

1:00:20.530 --> 1:00:23.360
I'm here to tell you that the
Bible talks about dark places.

1:00:23.360 --> 1:00:26.187
In Psalms 23:4 it says,
"Ye, though I would through

1:00:26.187 --> 1:00:27.850
"the valley of the shadow of death."

1:00:27.850 --> 1:00:29.480
Let's stop right there, valley.

1:00:29.480 --> 1:00:30.670
If there's a valley that means

1:00:30.670 --> 1:00:33.890
there's a peak before me and behind me.

1:00:33.890 --> 1:00:36.540
And if there's a shadow, in
order for a shadow to exist

1:00:36.540 --> 1:00:39.750
that means there has to be
light in the mid of darkness.

1:00:39.750 --> 1:00:42.148
For those of you who are in
some darkness I need you to know

1:00:42.148 --> 1:00:44.330
there's a present help,
there is a present light

1:00:44.330 --> 1:00:46.470
right next to you, but
you gotta keep walking.

1:00:46.470 --> 1:00:49.150
Do not get content in your dark places.

1:00:49.150 --> 1:00:51.810
I need you to understand,
don't pitch a tent in hell.

1:00:51.810 --> 1:00:54.070
Some of you are content
with your family conflict,

1:00:54.070 --> 1:00:55.620
you are content that you and your daughter

1:00:55.620 --> 1:00:57.720
don't speak anymore, pack up your tent

1:00:57.720 --> 1:00:59.000
and get ready to walk.

1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:00.650
The only way you gonna
get out of dark places

1:01:00.650 --> 1:01:02.196
is if keep moving to the light.

1:01:02.196 --> 1:01:04.530
And I need to let you know,
if I could keep walking

1:01:04.530 --> 1:01:07.120
even though I stumbled
I gave myself permission

1:01:07.120 --> 1:01:08.280
to try again.

1:01:08.280 --> 1:01:10.777
Give yourself permission to try again.

1:01:10.777 --> 1:01:13.000
"How do you get outta
dark places, Shantel?"

1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:14.800
I'm glad you asked.

1:01:14.800 --> 1:01:18.857
James 5:16 says, "Confess
your sins to one another

1:01:18.857 --> 1:01:21.447
"and pray for each other
so that you may be healed,"

1:01:21.447 --> 1:01:22.847
"for the prayers of a good man

1:01:22.847 --> 1:01:24.360
"are both righteous and effective."

1:01:24.360 --> 1:01:25.193
So what does that mean?

1:01:25.193 --> 1:01:26.257
Some of you keep coming here,

1:01:26.257 --> 1:01:28.770
and you are suffering in silence.

1:01:28.770 --> 1:01:30.820
Nobody knows what you're going through.

1:01:30.820 --> 1:01:33.617
You are lying convincingly when
someone says, "How are you?"

1:01:33.617 --> 1:01:34.950
And you say, "Okay."

1:01:34.950 --> 1:01:37.020
And that silence is the enemy

1:01:37.020 --> 1:01:39.310
putting a muzzle on your mouth of shame,

1:01:39.310 --> 1:01:41.430
and shame is why you go in your cave.

1:01:41.430 --> 1:01:44.090
Shame is why I was doing crack in my cave.

1:01:44.090 --> 1:01:45.900
What are you doing in your cave?

1:01:45.900 --> 1:01:49.000
Come to the light, you gotta
talk to somebody about it.

1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:50.350
And under the sound of my voice

1:01:50.350 --> 1:01:51.960
whatever God is revealing to you,

1:01:51.960 --> 1:01:54.060
He wants to release it from you.

1:01:54.060 --> 1:01:56.520
Whatever He is revealing
to you He wants to

1:01:56.520 --> 1:01:58.490
release it from you in the name of Jesus.

1:01:58.490 --> 1:02:00.247
Some of you are looking
at me, "Who is she?"

1:02:00.247 --> 1:02:01.100
"Why is she talking?"

1:02:01.100 --> 1:02:02.960
I'm somebody who's been
clean from crack cocaine

1:02:02.960 --> 1:02:04.630
from seven months right now.

1:02:04.630 --> 1:02:09.510
I'm somebody, I grew up in
a household and a community

1:02:09.510 --> 1:02:12.250
of women selling their
furniture for drugs,

1:02:12.250 --> 1:02:14.300
selling their kids toys for drugs,

1:02:14.300 --> 1:02:16.040
watching drug dealers take the money

1:02:16.040 --> 1:02:17.400
knowing that they're killing other people,

1:02:17.400 --> 1:02:18.233
but you know what?

1:02:18.233 --> 1:02:21.120
When we are in dark
places we lack empathy.

1:02:21.120 --> 1:02:24.513
'Cause when we are in a cave
we are a victim and a villain.

1:02:26.017 --> 1:02:26.960
Who are you hurting

1:02:26.960 --> 1:02:29.750
because you choose to
stay in your dark places?

1:02:29.750 --> 1:02:32.143
My God, I'm here to let you know

1:02:32.143 --> 1:02:34.700
that you cannot be selfish
with your testimony.

1:02:34.700 --> 1:02:36.360
Someone's life is dependent on it,

1:02:36.360 --> 1:02:37.760
people are not relating to you

1:02:37.760 --> 1:02:39.530
simply because you've overcome,

1:02:39.530 --> 1:02:41.770
I need to know that you
struggled with something

1:02:41.770 --> 1:02:44.580
and you got through, that's
what's gonna keep me encouraged

1:02:44.580 --> 1:02:46.640
and some of you, you
gotta open your mouth.

1:02:46.640 --> 1:02:49.840
Stop suffering in silence,
the prayers of a good man

1:02:49.840 --> 1:02:51.190
are righteous and effective.

1:02:51.190 --> 1:02:55.307
And as it says in Ezekiel
33:6, "If I see the sword

1:02:55.307 --> 1:02:57.817
"and I do not blow the trumpet your blood

1:02:57.817 --> 1:02:58.820
"will be on my hands."

1:02:58.820 --> 1:03:00.330
I don't want your blood on my hands,

1:03:00.330 --> 1:03:03.070
I shared my word, I shared my word.

1:03:03.070 --> 1:03:05.749
You go share your word
too, thank you, Jesus.

1:03:05.749 --> 1:03:08.725
(audience cheering and applauding)

1:03:08.725 --> 1:03:11.308
(upbeat music)

1:03:12.287 --> 1:03:13.120
Thank you!

1:03:17.974 --> 1:03:19.800
- Don't tell me you're crying.

1:03:19.800 --> 1:03:22.520
- Chill, leave her alone.

1:03:22.520 --> 1:03:23.353
Here, mommy.

1:03:24.930 --> 1:03:25.763
- Ew!

1:03:29.150 --> 1:03:32.910
- All this time I never
thought about how I was living,

1:03:32.910 --> 1:03:34.820
or if I was really even living.

1:03:34.820 --> 1:03:37.340
- Yeah, it hit me like that too.

1:03:37.340 --> 1:03:40.880
Change was destined to happen,
God had a plan for my life

1:03:40.880 --> 1:03:43.170
and I finally started to listen.

1:03:43.170 --> 1:03:44.880
Something my father wanted.

1:03:44.880 --> 1:03:47.000
- What about your parents?

1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:49.440
Did they ever come to see you?

1:03:49.440 --> 1:03:51.380
- My mom was locked up.

1:03:51.380 --> 1:03:54.580
She was the quiet type,
always kept to herself,

1:03:54.580 --> 1:03:58.470
but, one day, the wrong man
rubbed her the wrong way,

1:03:58.470 --> 1:04:00.685
and (clucking tongue) she shot him.

1:04:00.685 --> 1:04:01.518
- Whoa!

1:04:03.880 --> 1:04:06.720
See, them quiet people can be deadly.

1:04:06.720 --> 1:04:08.853
So, what was your dad?

1:04:09.690 --> 1:04:12.970
Let me guess, I bet he
was a big time gangster.

1:04:12.970 --> 1:04:14.788
- Actually, he was a deacon.

1:04:14.788 --> 1:04:16.480
- Girl!

1:04:16.480 --> 1:04:18.970
What, for real?

1:04:18.970 --> 1:04:21.560
- He always tried to
get me to go to church

1:04:21.560 --> 1:04:25.080
but I just wanted to get
high, so we had an agreement,

1:04:25.080 --> 1:04:26.350
he would leave me alone

1:04:26.350 --> 1:04:29.090
as long as he could
take the kids to church.

1:04:29.090 --> 1:04:31.220
He kept his distance
and just prayed for me.

1:04:31.220 --> 1:04:32.920
- And how would you know that?

1:04:32.920 --> 1:04:34.380
- My kids would tell me.

1:04:34.380 --> 1:04:35.260
They would also tell me

1:04:35.260 --> 1:04:37.320
that they were praying for me as well.

1:04:37.320 --> 1:04:39.180
I'm sure it was their prayers

1:04:39.180 --> 1:04:41.880
that kept me saved many of nights.

1:04:41.880 --> 1:04:43.820
- My kids pray for me.

1:04:43.820 --> 1:04:47.120
Matter of fact, they call me every day

1:04:47.120 --> 1:04:48.900
just to tell me they love me.

1:04:49.890 --> 1:04:50.723
- Okay.

1:04:51.620 --> 1:04:54.420
I mean, how long has
your man been locked up?

1:04:54.420 --> 1:04:55.740
Shouldn't he be out by now?

1:04:55.740 --> 1:04:57.702
- Crazy thing, he been out.

1:04:57.702 --> 1:04:59.600
- Huh?
- What?

1:04:59.600 --> 1:05:02.533
- He got out for a little
while and didn't even tell me.

1:05:03.926 --> 1:05:06.883
- How can someone who say
they love you do that to you?

1:05:07.920 --> 1:05:10.960
- Well, the last time we had
a visit we had an argument.

1:05:10.960 --> 1:05:14.650
He didn't like me
telling him how to change

1:05:14.650 --> 1:05:18.670
and he said he didn't want
anything to do with me or God.

1:05:18.670 --> 1:05:20.960
So I got mad and I said,
well, if you don't want God,

1:05:20.960 --> 1:05:22.260
then you don't want me.

1:05:22.260 --> 1:05:25.450
I thought eventually he
would change his mind.

1:05:25.450 --> 1:05:28.500
- That's too bad, you thought wrong.

1:05:28.500 --> 1:05:29.650
- [Terrance] Look, I just need somebody

1:05:29.650 --> 1:05:30.483
that's gonna hold me down

1:05:30.483 --> 1:05:31.330
like I hold them down, you know?

1:05:31.330 --> 1:05:32.480
- [Woman] Okay.

1:05:32.480 --> 1:05:34.562
- You know, if you with it, let's get it.

1:05:34.562 --> 1:05:36.114
I'm for real, let's get it.

1:05:36.114 --> 1:05:36.947
Hold up.

1:05:37.841 --> 1:05:38.924
Ah, hell naw.

1:05:41.577 --> 1:05:43.210
Everything gonna be cool,
don't worry about nothing,

1:05:43.210 --> 1:05:44.997
just stay right here, all right.

1:05:48.980 --> 1:05:51.630
- I should cut your genitals
off and FedEx them to your mom.

1:05:51.630 --> 1:05:52.735
- My what?

1:05:52.735 --> 1:05:54.320
- What are you doing, what
are you doing, Terrance?

1:05:54.320 --> 1:05:55.480
- Look, man, cool out.

1:05:55.480 --> 1:05:58.010
- So it's bad enough you got
outta jail and didn't tell me,

1:05:58.010 --> 1:05:59.533
and now you up here with some hoochie.

1:05:59.533 --> 1:06:00.366
- She ain't

1:06:00.366 --> 1:06:01.199
no hoochie.
- Hoochie,

1:06:01.199 --> 1:06:02.032
you know he married, right?

1:06:02.032 --> 1:06:02.865
- He didn't tell me
- She ain't no hoochie.

1:06:02.865 --> 1:06:03.698
- he was married!

1:06:03.698 --> 1:06:04.531
- Who you talking?

1:06:04.531 --> 1:06:05.607
Say something else, say
something else smart to me

1:06:05.607 --> 1:06:07.209
so I can rip your tongue
- Aye, Shantel!

1:06:07.209 --> 1:06:08.220
out from your mouth.

1:06:08.220 --> 1:06:09.682
- You a preacher, remember?

1:06:09.682 --> 1:06:10.515
You need to cool out.

1:06:10.515 --> 1:06:11.650
- Why you got me out here looking stupid?

1:06:11.650 --> 1:06:12.550
- I ain't got you out here looking stupid.

1:06:12.550 --> 1:06:13.870
- What, you want a divorce?

1:06:13.870 --> 1:06:14.703
- Nah.

1:06:14.703 --> 1:06:17.063
- Then why you acting like it, Terrance.

1:06:17.063 --> 1:06:20.081
- Good for nothing, nigga, don't call me!

1:06:20.081 --> 1:06:22.557
(Terrance stammering)

1:06:22.557 --> 1:06:23.390
- Aye!

1:06:23.390 --> 1:06:24.240
(Shantel stammering)

1:06:24.240 --> 1:06:26.130
- You don't even know her name, do you.

1:06:26.130 --> 1:06:26.963
- Man, shut up.

1:06:26.963 --> 1:06:28.780
- Aye!
- Shame.

1:06:28.780 --> 1:06:29.613
- Yo.

1:06:30.756 --> 1:06:31.589
Shantel!

1:06:32.455 --> 1:06:33.288
Aye!

1:06:35.160 --> 1:06:36.320
Yo.

1:06:36.320 --> 1:06:38.170
Aye, y'all quit walking away from me.

1:06:43.565 --> 1:06:44.398
Shantel!

1:06:47.629 --> 1:06:48.462
Aye!

1:06:49.910 --> 1:06:52.790
- So, he was talking
about trying something new

1:06:52.790 --> 1:06:54.417
like skydiving, right?

I told him, you're not leaving me broke.

1:07:02.180 --> 1:07:04.850
You better go sign some
life insurance papers,

1:07:04.850 --> 1:07:08.327
and then, you can go and sky die.

1:07:08.327 --> 1:07:10.700
(all laughing)

1:07:10.700 --> 1:07:13.836

severe, don't you think?

- No.

1:07:15.251 --> 1:07:16.330

1:08:35.890 --> 1:08:37.640
for having us over for Bible study.

1:08:38.680 --> 1:08:41.957
Even though we got a bit
off, it was still good.

1:08:41.957 --> 1:08:43.363

1:09:58.042 --> 1:10:00.459

1:10:09.970 --> 1:10:10.870

- So you don't believe me?

1:10:26.963 --> 1:10:28.530

1:10:28.530 --> 1:10:29.480

1:10:29.480 --> 1:10:32.880
- Please don't call Tasha, you
know she's gonna act crazy.

1:10:32.880 --> 1:10:35.906
- Yeah, you know Tasha
would kick your butt.

1:10:35.906 --> 1:10:38.923
- Hey, look, you ain't never
gotta worry about that again.

1:10:40.100 --> 1:10:41.480

1:11:32.179 --> 1:11:33.240
- What, you was talking
about the praying seat?

1:11:33.240 --> 1:11:35.140
- Girl, I'm saying, she can't be up there

1:11:35.140 --> 1:11:36.540
with a mouthful of cavities

1:11:36.540 --> 1:11:38.456
with red lipstick on her teeth,

1:11:38.456 --> 1:11:39.321

1:11:42.370 --> 1:11:44.670
I was just telling her
about it yesterday too.

1:11:45.851 --> 1:11:46.684
- Is this enough?

1:11:46.684 --> 1:11:47.517
- Yeah, that's enough.
- Shantel, I need to go

1:11:47.517 --> 1:11:48.970

1:11:48.970 --> 1:11:49.803
- Wait, it's--

1:11:49.803 --> 1:11:50.713

- Better be good too.

1:11:51.546 --> 1:11:53.370
- Yeah, you better move on.
- [Shantel] Get out.

1:11:53.370 --> 1:11:54.819
- [Woman] Excuse me.

1:11:54.819 --> 1:11:56.410
Shoot, won't be back.

1:11:56.410 --> 1:11:58.320
(dramatic music)

1:11:58.320 --> 1:12:00.470
- Look man, don't be running
my clients out like that.

1:12:00.470 --> 1:12:02.773
- And you know you can't be
doing that mess in my house!

1:12:02.773 --> 1:12:05.160
- Well this mess putting
money in your pocket, right?

1:12:05.160 --> 1:12:06.580
This mess been paying the bills up in here

1:12:06.580 --> 1:12:07.960
since I been locked up.

1:12:07.960 --> 1:12:09.220
Where you think that money came from?

1:12:09.220 --> 1:12:12.070
- Little boy, I don't
need your drug money,

1:12:12.070 --> 1:12:14.147
and I don't need you, you can go.

1:12:14.147 --> 1:12:16.210
- Oh, I can go now, huh?

1:12:16.210 --> 1:12:17.900
Oh, I could leave, huh?

1:12:17.900 --> 1:12:21.930
What happened to the, "Oh,
T, how am I gonna get by?"

1:12:21.930 --> 1:12:23.053
- I grew up.

1:12:24.200 --> 1:12:25.950
- Too bad your bank account didn't.

1:12:27.290 --> 1:12:30.740
- I don't need your drug
money and I don't need you,

1:12:30.740 --> 1:12:31.803
you can bounce!

1:12:33.170 --> 1:12:35.570
- Look, I pay the bills up in
here, I ain't going nowhere.

1:12:35.570 --> 1:12:36.770
You can go if you wanna.

1:12:38.220 --> 1:12:39.053
Matter of fact

1:12:39.053 --> 1:12:40.029
you can leave right now.
- Get your hands off me,

1:12:40.029 --> 1:12:41.533

1:12:47.719 --> 1:12:49.787
- Man, what's wrong with you?

1:12:49.787 --> 1:12:50.933
You know anything I do
now is self-defense?

1:12:50.933 --> 1:12:53.123
- I don't think it works like that.

1:12:54.550 --> 1:12:55.639
- The way it ain't gonna work is

1:12:55.639 --> 1:12:56.887
you running my clients outta here

1:12:56.887 --> 1:12:57.783
and telling me how to do my business.

1:12:57.783 --> 1:12:59.373
- This is my house, mine!

1:13:00.340 --> 1:13:02.090
Go do your business somewhere else.

1:13:06.110 --> 1:13:08.870
That's self-defense.

1:13:08.870 --> 1:13:10.287
No more, no more Terrance,

1:13:10.287 --> 1:13:12.250
I'm not doing this with you no more.

1:13:17.500 --> 1:13:19.754
- Tell me how to run my
business, mess with my money?

1:13:19.754 --> 1:13:20.587
(Shantel groaning)

1:13:20.587 --> 1:13:21.420
Hmm, what?

1:13:22.995 --> 1:13:23.828
- Jesus!

1:13:28.050 --> 1:13:30.295

1:13:30.295 --> 1:13:33.295

1:13:42.992 --> 1:13:45.742

1:13:53.240 --> 1:13:55.350

I'll make you a plate.

1:13:57.443 --> 1:13:58.793
- [Shantel] I'm not hungry.

1:14:00.110 --> 1:14:01.690
(Terrance sighing)

1:14:01.690 --> 1:14:05.240
- Look, Shantel, yesterday
got a little outta hand.

1:14:05.240 --> 1:14:06.303
Look, I'm sorry.

1:14:07.197 --> 1:14:10.180
But I made breakfast, so,
let me make it up to you.

1:14:10.180 --> 1:14:12.660
- [Shantel] I said, I'm not hungry.

1:14:12.660 --> 1:14:14.510
- Look, I said I'm sorry, all right?

1:14:14.510 --> 1:14:16.660
I made breakfast, let
me make it up to you!

1:14:23.562 --> 1:14:24.458
- I hate you,

1:14:24.458 --> 1:14:25.945
I hate you.
- You ungrateful.

1:14:25.945 --> 1:14:26.778
- Nothing I do is--

1:14:26.778 --> 1:14:27.611
(knocking on door)

1:14:27.611 --> 1:14:30.058
- Man, who the hell you
got coming over here?

1:14:30.058 --> 1:14:31.141
- Get off me!

1:14:35.836 --> 1:14:38.330
- [Carol] Hey, Shantel.

1:14:38.330 --> 1:14:40.670
- [Shantel] Hey, Carol,
what brings you by?

1:14:40.670 --> 1:14:43.940
- Pastor Green called

1:14:43.940 --> 1:14:45.530
is everything okay?

1:14:45.530 --> 1:14:46.810
- Everything good, what's going on?

1:14:46.810 --> 1:14:49.190
- Shantel and I need to talk alone.

1:14:49.190 --> 1:14:50.023
- Nah, this is my house.

1:14:50.023 --> 1:14:51.750
Anything you gotta say you
can say right here right now.

1:14:51.750 --> 1:14:53.320
- Terrance.

1:14:53.320 --> 1:14:54.153
It's all right.

1:14:56.270 --> 1:14:57.537
- I gotta handle some business,

1:14:57.537 --> 1:14:59.837
but she better be gone
by the time I get back.

1:15:03.593 --> 1:15:05.640
- I'm so sorry you had to experience that.

1:15:05.640 --> 1:15:06.843
- It's okay.

1:15:08.173 --> 1:15:12.030
Shantel, if you ever need
anything, anyone just to talk to,

1:15:12.030 --> 1:15:13.643
I'm always here.

1:15:15.160 --> 1:15:16.970
- Thanks, Carol, I really appreciate that.

1:15:16.970 --> 1:15:17.803
- Of course.

1:15:30.960 --> 1:15:32.410
- Where your little buddy go?

1:15:34.080 --> 1:15:35.803
- Drunk, in front of me?

1:15:37.750 --> 1:15:39.350
- Oh, you talking about me, huh?

1:15:40.793 --> 1:15:43.243
You talking about me, huh?

1:15:43.243 --> 1:15:46.550
I'm not your little church
friend, Sister Somebody.

1:15:46.550 --> 1:15:47.383
- I'm not doing this with you right now.

1:15:47.383 --> 1:15:50.510
- Aye, aye, hold up, think
you is high and mighty?

1:15:50.510 --> 1:15:51.860
Don't forget who pay the bills up in here.

1:15:51.860 --> 1:15:52.809
- This is my house!

1:15:52.809 --> 1:15:53.642
- This my house!

1:15:53.642 --> 1:15:55.220
- This is my house, I didn't
have to let you come back

1:15:55.220 --> 1:15:56.270
in the first place!

1:15:56.270 --> 1:15:58.044
- Who you talking to?

1:15:58.044 --> 1:16:00.708
You better talk to me with some respect.

1:16:00.708 --> 1:16:01.817
(laughing)

1:16:01.817 --> 1:16:04.205
You think you're better
than me, don't you?

1:16:04.205 --> 1:16:05.240
- What you gonna do?

1:16:05.240 --> 1:16:06.626
- You think you better than me.

1:16:06.626 --> 1:16:08.760
- What you gone do?

1:16:08.760 --> 1:16:09.593
Nothing.

1:16:10.428 --> 1:16:11.419
Ouch!

1:16:11.419 --> 1:16:12.252
Stupid.

1:16:12.252 --> 1:16:15.570
(dramatic music)

1:16:15.570 --> 1:16:17.302
Get outta my house.
- [Terrance] No, you get out.

1:16:17.302 --> 1:16:18.135
- Get outta my house.

1:16:18.135 --> 1:16:18.968
- No, you get out

1:16:18.968 --> 1:16:20.433
my house.
- Get outta my, ow!

1:16:20.433 --> 1:16:22.099
Get off me, are you crazy?

1:16:22.099 --> 1:16:23.266
Get off of me.

1:16:24.159 --> 1:16:24.992
- Let's go.

1:16:24.992 --> 1:16:27.825
- Get off me, and don't come back!

1:16:36.458 --> 1:16:39.803
Come on, Ray, pick up
the phone, I need you.

1:16:39.803 --> 1:16:41.800
Come on, pick up the phone.

1:16:41.800 --> 1:16:42.700
- Hello?

1:16:42.700 --> 1:16:45.530
- Ray, come quick, he's gone crazy!

1:16:45.530 --> 1:16:48.330
- Yeah, yeah, I know, I'm
already pulling up, all right.

1:16:54.030 --> 1:16:57.307
- Look Shantel, look, I ain't
trying to do this with you.

1:16:57.307 --> 1:16:59.640
But you keep pushing me to the edge.

1:16:59.640 --> 1:17:01.140
Look, I'm trying--
- It's a spirit

1:17:01.140 --> 1:17:02.390
controlling you, making you--

1:17:02.390 --> 1:17:04.255
- Look, I'm not trying to
hear nothing about no spirit.

1:17:04.255 --> 1:17:05.088
- You're not

1:17:05.088 --> 1:17:06.093
in your right mind.
- Man, what spirit?

1:17:06.927 --> 1:17:07.943
- Shay, what's going on in here?

1:17:07.943 --> 1:17:08.776
- Man!

1:17:09.610 --> 1:17:10.830
Oh, all right.

1:17:10.830 --> 1:17:11.852
Oh, all right.

1:17:11.852 --> 1:17:13.990
(dramatic music)

1:17:13.990 --> 1:17:16.850
- We've been arguing all
day, he's been drinking,

1:17:16.850 --> 1:17:18.913
I have never seen him like this before.

1:17:19.850 --> 1:17:22.540
- You gonna come up in my house like that?

1:17:22.540 --> 1:17:24.040
He come up in here, you call him

1:17:24.040 --> 1:17:26.120
to come get me or something, huh?

1:17:26.120 --> 1:17:27.880
The house I pay the bills at?

1:17:27.880 --> 1:17:29.430
- Terrance, what are you doing?

1:17:31.200 --> 1:17:33.220
- Let's leave, let's go, let's go.

1:17:33.220 --> 1:17:36.693
- Nah, sis, we ain't going
nowhere, you gotta roll, cuz.

1:17:56.544 --> 1:17:57.810
(sighing)

1:17:57.810 --> 1:18:01.110
- I'm so sorry, I didn't
know he had a gun.

1:18:01.110 --> 1:18:02.240
Look, I'ma call the police right now

1:18:02.240 --> 1:18:04.143
to make sure he doesn't come back here.

1:18:20.720 --> 1:18:22.970
- Evening, Ms. Taylor,
my name's Officer Harper,

1:18:22.970 --> 1:18:25.040
I'm responding to a call
about an individual,

1:18:25.040 --> 1:18:27.020
is he still around here?

1:18:27.020 --> 1:18:29.320
- No, no, he's not.

1:18:29.320 --> 1:18:30.830
- Well, we're here to help,

1:18:30.830 --> 1:18:32.410
but if there's anything
you're holding back,

1:18:32.410 --> 1:18:34.620
there's not much we can do for you.

1:18:34.620 --> 1:18:38.160
- Yeah, I understand, I really
don't know where he went.

1:18:38.160 --> 1:18:39.797
- You let us know if he comes back

1:18:39.797 --> 1:18:43.325
'cause we want this to
stop before it gets worse.

1:18:43.325 --> 1:18:44.353
- And he won't be able to get in

1:18:44.353 --> 1:18:46.740
because he left his keys inside.

1:18:46.740 --> 1:18:48.520
- Well, we'll leave an
undercover patrol car

1:18:48.520 --> 1:18:50.590
in the neighborhood just in case.

1:18:50.590 --> 1:18:52.030
But you take care of yourself, Ms. Taylor.

1:18:52.030 --> 1:18:53.089
- All right, thank you,

1:18:53.089 --> 1:18:55.672
Officer Harper.
- Not a problem.

1:19:06.209 --> 1:19:07.042
(dramatic music)

1:19:07.042 --> 1:19:07.930
- Not now, okay.

1:19:07.930 --> 1:19:08.763
- Not now?

1:19:08.763 --> 1:19:11.780
Girl, listen to me, Terrance
is at my house right now

1:19:11.780 --> 1:19:13.630
and he is going off.

1:19:13.630 --> 1:19:16.330
Robert's egging him on, what
in the world is going on?

1:19:16.330 --> 1:19:18.010
- Look, your brother is a maniac.

1:19:18.010 --> 1:19:19.330
- Girl, what are you talking about?

1:19:19.330 --> 1:19:23.543
- Kira, he put hands on me and
he pulled a gun out on Ray.

1:19:26.860 --> 1:19:30.326
- I'm sorry, I didn't know.

1:19:30.326 --> 1:19:32.023
I didn't know, girl, I'm sorry.

1:19:33.725 --> 1:19:34.558
I didn't know.

1:19:40.210 --> 1:19:41.543
Let's go.
- Get on in here.

1:19:49.720 --> 1:19:53.070
- Oh my God, a mess in
here, ugh, goodness.

1:19:54.237 --> 1:19:56.101
- [Ray] Yeah, it's back through here.

1:19:56.101 --> 1:19:59.756
Hey, get under here.

1:19:59.756 --> 1:20:00.589
- [Kira] Got it.

1:20:00.589 --> 1:20:01.422
- [Ray] You good?

1:20:01.422 --> 1:20:03.004
- [Kira] Yeah, thank you.

1:20:03.004 --> 1:20:04.585
- [Ray] Boy, it's quiet in here.

1:20:04.585 --> 1:20:05.418
- [Kira] I know it.

1:20:05.418 --> 1:20:07.610
- Aye, aye, can we get some
real music in here, please?

1:20:07.610 --> 1:20:08.443
- Ah, ah, ah, ah

1:20:08.443 --> 1:20:09.276
okay.
- Right.

1:20:09.276 --> 1:20:10.770
- I don't want all that
cursing up in my house now.

1:20:10.770 --> 1:20:11.603
- Cursing?

1:20:11.603 --> 1:20:12.520
- What?

1:20:12.520 --> 1:20:14.000
Girl, you are tripping,

1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:15.579
we need to hear something up in here.

1:20:15.579 --> 1:20:16.412
- [Ray] Something.

1:20:16.412 --> 1:20:17.245
- For real.

1:20:17.245 --> 1:20:18.078
- Well, I'll go get my gospel albums.

1:20:18.078 --> 1:20:19.810
- Hold on, gospel, come on now.

1:20:19.810 --> 1:20:20.800
Ain't nobody trying to hear

1:20:20.800 --> 1:20:22.687
them old Negro spirituals
you be playing all the time.

1:20:22.687 --> 1:20:23.563
(all laughing)

1:20:23.563 --> 1:20:26.120
Look, man, I got some Maxwell in the car.

1:20:26.120 --> 1:20:27.203
You still like Maxwell, don't you?

1:20:27.203 --> 1:20:28.036
- Oh, yes.

1:20:28.950 --> 1:20:32.600
Shay, you used to love Maxwell,
come on, you are tripping.

1:20:32.600 --> 1:20:33.433
Come on.

1:20:33.433 --> 1:20:38.433
- Like I said, I'll go get
my gospel albums, okay.

1:20:38.460 --> 1:20:42.353
Holy Ghost filled, church household.

1:20:43.690 --> 1:20:46.469
- Please go to the car
and get them cds for me.

1:20:46.469 --> 1:20:47.302
I'll take care
- Good idea.

1:20:47.302 --> 1:20:48.323
- of the wipe down.

1:20:48.323 --> 1:20:49.156
- Yes, thank you.

1:20:49.156 --> 1:20:53.656
- All right, I'll take care
of this floor for you too.

1:21:13.537 --> 1:21:16.901
(dramatic music)

1:21:16.901 --> 1:21:17.998
(knocking on door)

1:21:17.998 --> 1:21:18.831
- Shantel!

1:21:19.764 --> 1:21:21.140
Shantel!

1:21:21.140 --> 1:21:22.456
Man, open the door!

1:21:22.456 --> 1:21:23.289
Shantel!

1:21:24.201 --> 1:21:26.118
I need to get my stuff.

1:21:28.797 --> 1:21:29.630
Shantel!

1:21:32.070 --> 1:21:33.232
- [Shantel] Go away, Terrance.

1:21:33.232 --> 1:21:35.628
- [Terrance] I need to get my stuff!

1:21:35.628 --> 1:21:36.628
- Calm down!

1:21:38.307 --> 1:21:41.850
(knocking on door)

1:21:41.850 --> 1:21:43.050
- [Shantel] I gotta
have him get his stuff,

1:21:43.050 --> 1:21:44.650
at least he'll be out the house.

1:21:47.733 --> 1:21:48.566
- [Terrance] Taking all
day to open the door for?

1:21:48.566 --> 1:21:50.510
- What you banging on
the door like that for?

1:21:54.071 --> 1:21:54.904
Ray, wait, don't!

1:21:54.904 --> 1:21:58.447
(dramatic music)

1:21:58.447 --> 1:22:03.417
- Robert, Robert, no,
Robert, look, leave 'em.

1:22:04.765 --> 1:22:06.963
- Ray no, no!

1:22:06.963 --> 1:22:07.796
(screaming)

1:22:07.796 --> 1:22:08.713
- Terrance!

1:22:11.517 --> 1:22:12.350
No!

1:22:13.651 --> 1:22:16.234
(Ray groaning)

1:22:18.668 --> 1:22:19.668
- [Ray] God.

1:22:21.618 --> 1:22:22.960
- Get down!

1:22:22.960 --> 1:22:23.886
Get down!

1:22:23.886 --> 1:22:26.861
(guns blaring)

1:22:26.861 --> 1:22:29.278
(soft music)

1:22:31.871 --> 1:22:34.371
(Kira crying)

1:22:39.078 --> 1:22:41.091
(Ray coughing)

1:22:41.091 --> 1:22:44.170
(Kira crying)

1:22:44.170 --> 1:22:46.420
(groaning)

1:22:48.029 --> 1:22:50.577
I don't wanna die, oh my God.

1:22:50.577 --> 1:22:53.160
(somber music)

1:23:07.343 --> 1:23:08.383
- Mrs. Taylor?

1:23:10.350 --> 1:23:11.283
Mrs. Taylor.

1:23:12.960 --> 1:23:14.293
Mrs. Taylor!

1:23:15.660 --> 1:23:17.500
I need you to start from
the beginning, please.

1:23:17.500 --> 1:23:18.800
- What?

1:23:18.800 --> 1:23:20.193
- How did it all start?

1:23:23.190 --> 1:23:24.190
Ms. Taylor?

1:23:25.710 --> 1:23:28.353
Ms. Taylor, the incident,

1:23:29.480 --> 1:23:32.460
I need for you to tell
me, how did it start?

1:23:32.460 --> 1:23:34.605
- [Shantel] Yes, yes, ma'am.

1:23:34.605 --> 1:23:39.605
- What happened?

1:23:42.675 --> 1:23:45.297
- Me and my husband, we eat eggs.

1:23:48.020 --> 1:23:49.620
- [Woman] Was there an argument?

1:23:51.940 --> 1:23:53.333
- I should get outta there,

1:23:56.558 --> 1:23:58.680
I should get Pastor.

1:23:58.680 --> 1:23:59.513
- Pastor?

1:24:01.160 --> 1:24:02.070
Mrs. Taylor, are you all right?

1:24:02.070 --> 1:24:03.453
- And my brother.

1:24:04.860 --> 1:24:07.035
And my brother, where is my brother?

1:24:07.035 --> 1:24:07.868
Is he okay?

1:24:07.868 --> 1:24:11.090
- Your brother is in
the ICU, but right now

1:24:11.090 --> 1:24:13.140
I need to know what happened.

1:24:13.140 --> 1:24:15.310
- Is he going to be okay?

1:24:15.310 --> 1:24:17.220
- [Woman] I am certain that the hospital

1:24:17.220 --> 1:24:19.270
is doing the very best that they can,

1:24:19.270 --> 1:24:23.630
but right now Ms. Taylor, I
need to know how did this start?

1:24:23.630 --> 1:24:24.463
- No!

1:24:26.118 --> 1:24:26.951
No.

1:24:29.720 --> 1:24:33.380
Jesus, Jesus, please keep him alive.

1:24:33.380 --> 1:24:37.930
Please keep Ray alive,
in the name of Jesus.

1:24:37.930 --> 1:24:38.913
- Mrs. Taylor,

1:24:41.340 --> 1:24:43.990
take your moment, I'll be
back in just a few minutes.

1:24:47.346 --> 1:24:48.179
Ray.

1:24:48.179 --> 1:24:51.082
(praying softly)

1:24:51.082 --> 1:24:54.362
(somber music)

1:24:54.362 --> 1:24:56.637
(Kira crying)

1:24:56.637 --> 1:24:58.887
(groaning)

1:25:00.205 --> 1:25:03.455
- I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die!

1:25:17.099 --> 1:25:19.510
- Tell me how to run my
business, mess with my money?

1:25:19.510 --> 1:25:20.343
Hmm, what?

1:25:22.247 --> 1:25:23.080
- Jesus!

1:25:25.358 --> 1:25:26.191
Lord,

1:25:27.183 --> 1:25:28.016
I need help.

1:25:29.860 --> 1:25:31.273
I need change.

1:25:32.910 --> 1:25:37.910
Please send something, anything,
I can't take this anymore.

1:25:39.580 --> 1:25:41.767
I can't take this anymore, please.

1:26:01.325 --> 1:26:03.742
(soft music)

1:26:08.670 --> 1:26:10.707
"Dear Mrs. Taylor,

1:26:10.707 --> 1:26:12.617
"we have heard of your
exceptional preaching

1:26:12.617 --> 1:26:14.867
"and would like to know
if you would fill in

1:26:14.867 --> 1:26:18.587
"for our pastor in
Murfreesboro, Tennessee."

1:26:18.587 --> 1:26:21.157
"We would pay for all
of your moving expenses

1:26:21.157 --> 1:26:23.437
"and your transition."

1:26:23.437 --> 1:26:25.691
"Please contact Julie within the next."

1:26:25.691 --> 1:26:28.608
(knocking on door)

1:26:46.600 --> 1:26:47.606
(wincing)

1:26:47.606 --> 1:26:49.856
(coughing)

1:26:55.220 --> 1:26:56.533
Divorce papers!

1:26:59.600 --> 1:27:00.433
Wait.

1:27:02.520 --> 1:27:05.683
God can still save our marriage,
he can still change you.

1:27:10.060 --> 1:27:12.117
- I'll be back for my stuff later.

1:27:57.110 --> 1:28:01.183
- Hi, can I speak to Julie, please?

1:28:07.825 --> 1:28:09.825
- What happened to Kira?

1:28:10.760 --> 1:28:11.810
- She didn't make it.

1:28:13.200 --> 1:28:17.503
The bullet passed through a
major artery and she bled out.

1:28:21.750 --> 1:28:24.550
I loved her so much.

1:28:24.550 --> 1:28:27.973
She was always there, she was
my sister, my best friend.

1:28:33.350 --> 1:28:35.563
- So, what happened to your brother?

1:28:36.610 --> 1:28:39.190
- He was lucky, but, not so lucky.

1:28:39.190 --> 1:28:43.520
He survived the gunshot but
he got a one life sentence

1:28:43.520 --> 1:28:44.633
for attempted murder.

1:28:46.400 --> 1:28:48.280
- At least your husband pulled through.

1:28:48.280 --> 1:28:52.033
- Yeah, it was amazing, God
still had plans for him.

1:28:52.943 --> 1:28:55.973
- Oh, so, I mean, getting
shot up wasn't good enough?

1:28:56.830 --> 1:29:00.880
- That was Satan's plan,
God had plans for his soul.

1:29:00.880 --> 1:29:03.990
- So God had plans for
his soul, not his body?

1:29:03.990 --> 1:29:05.650
I don't get it.

1:29:05.650 --> 1:29:08.340
- We have free will to
do whatever we want.

1:29:08.340 --> 1:29:11.553
Therefore, God will not
force us to follow His will.

1:29:13.010 --> 1:29:14.160
- I still don't get it.

1:29:15.070 --> 1:29:16.330
- You have kids, right?

1:29:16.330 --> 1:29:17.380
- [Lisa] Yeah.

1:29:17.380 --> 1:29:20.200
- And you raise them to the
best of your ability, right?

1:29:20.200 --> 1:29:24.190
- Most definitely, nobody
loves my babies more than me.

1:29:24.190 --> 1:29:25.460
- And when they become of age

1:29:25.460 --> 1:29:27.320
you hope they make the best decisions

1:29:27.320 --> 1:29:30.150
and don't get into trouble,
but even if they do,

1:29:30.150 --> 1:29:31.690
you'll still be there for them, right?

1:29:31.690 --> 1:29:34.030
- Yeah, of course.

1:29:34.030 --> 1:29:36.290
They're my children no matter what.

1:29:36.290 --> 1:29:37.493
I'll always love them.

1:29:39.770 --> 1:29:40.603
- Get it now?

1:29:44.480 --> 1:29:46.343
Lisa, did you come closer?

1:29:47.340 --> 1:29:48.173
- She did too.

1:29:50.163 --> 1:29:51.963
Plus, the chair was hurting my butt.

1:29:54.470 --> 1:29:55.580
- Okay.

1:29:55.580 --> 1:29:59.753
- Speaking of kids, how are
yours doing during all of this?

1:30:01.820 --> 1:30:04.810
- They came along, it was difficult.

1:30:04.810 --> 1:30:07.460
I sat my boys down and
I apologized to them

1:30:07.460 --> 1:30:11.350
without any excuses for not
being the mother they deserved.

1:30:11.350 --> 1:30:14.460
Then I heard them tell
me how my drug addiction

1:30:14.460 --> 1:30:19.460
and distancing made them feel,
which put a hole in my soul.

1:30:19.480 --> 1:30:20.993
- I can only imagine.

1:30:22.220 --> 1:30:25.900
- Afterwards, they forgave
me and I promised them

1:30:25.900 --> 1:30:28.783
I would be the best mother
I could possibly be.

1:30:29.690 --> 1:30:32.350
We agreed that this was a part of our past

1:30:32.350 --> 1:30:34.330
and it was not gonna be brought up anymore

1:30:34.330 --> 1:30:36.680
unless it was gonna be
used as a testimony.

1:30:36.680 --> 1:30:38.350
And to this day my boys

1:30:38.350 --> 1:30:41.059
have not thrown this back in my face.

1:30:41.059 --> 1:30:46.059
- That is wonderful, I hope
my kids forgive me like that.

1:30:48.070 --> 1:30:51.460
- It's difficult, but we have
to let our children open up

1:30:51.460 --> 1:30:53.810
and hear them out no
matter how much it hurts,

1:30:53.810 --> 1:30:55.110
for them to be healed too.

1:30:56.340 --> 1:30:58.480
- I don't understand, why are you sad

1:30:58.480 --> 1:31:00.130
about leaving an abusive husband?

1:31:01.317 --> 1:31:03.430
- Because that was her husband,

1:31:03.430 --> 1:31:05.133
that bond took years to make.

1:31:06.940 --> 1:31:11.150
- Yeah, leaving always
seems like the best option

1:31:11.150 --> 1:31:14.210
but it feels like the
worse while it's happening.

1:31:14.210 --> 1:31:16.500
- So please tell me you got over him.

1:31:16.500 --> 1:31:20.570
- In time, yes, but I had
to move and start new.

1:31:20.570 --> 1:31:24.110
So I packed my stuff up
and answered the calling.

1:31:24.110 --> 1:31:25.930
- The church letter calling?

1:31:25.930 --> 1:31:28.160
- God knew what he was
doing when he did it.

1:31:28.160 --> 1:31:29.490
Terrance gave me a way out,

1:31:29.490 --> 1:31:31.223
and the letter gave me direction.

1:31:32.250 --> 1:31:34.430
- Seems he did you a favor.

1:31:34.430 --> 1:31:38.480
- Yeah, but, he also
suffered in our relationship.

1:31:38.480 --> 1:31:39.760
- How's that?

1:31:39.760 --> 1:31:42.910
- He lost family members,
and his mother, brother,

1:31:42.910 --> 1:31:45.370
and cousins were emotionally destroyed.

1:31:45.370 --> 1:31:47.810
- But please, tell me you got outta there?

1:31:47.810 --> 1:31:50.690
- I did, in 2003 I was evangelizing

1:31:50.690 --> 1:31:53.650
in Murfreesboro, Tennessee,
I went back to school,

1:31:53.650 --> 1:31:57.460
I got a degree, I got a good
job, and I started mentoring.

1:31:57.460 --> 1:32:01.679
But late one night I got a
phone call from guess who?

1:32:01.679 --> 1:32:03.401
(speaking in foreign language)

1:32:03.401 --> 1:32:04.234
- Wow.

1:32:04.234 --> 1:32:05.067
- Oh man.

1:32:11.437 --> 1:32:14.104
(phone ringing)

1:32:17.734 --> 1:32:20.151
(soft music)

1:32:22.355 --> 1:32:23.805
- Hello.

1:32:23.805 --> 1:32:26.380
- I'm in the hospital.

1:32:26.380 --> 1:32:27.213
- Terrance.

1:32:28.399 --> 1:32:30.560
- Shantel, they say it's pneumonia.

1:32:30.560 --> 1:32:31.473
- Pneumonia,

1:32:33.700 --> 1:32:34.873
that's serious.

1:32:36.656 --> 1:32:39.020
Well, I'll keep you in my prayers.

1:32:39.020 --> 1:32:40.083
- Can you,

1:32:44.134 --> 1:32:45.684
Shantel, can you come visit me?

1:32:46.520 --> 1:32:48.737
I'm at the Vanderbilt
Hospital in Nashville.

1:32:52.900 --> 1:32:53.733
Hello?

1:32:55.730 --> 1:32:56.630
You still there?

1:32:56.630 --> 1:32:58.530
- Terrance, I...

1:33:00.940 --> 1:33:04.543
- Hey, just think about it, if you can.

1:33:09.700 --> 1:33:10.533
- Okay.

1:33:11.772 --> 1:33:13.160
(knocking on door)

1:33:13.160 --> 1:33:15.110
- Mr. Taylor, I'm here to check on you.

1:33:15.960 --> 1:33:18.226
Let's check out your IV.

1:33:18.226 --> 1:33:20.309
See if it's running okay.

1:33:21.245 --> 1:33:23.020
I'll listen to your lungs and your heart.

1:33:23.020 --> 1:33:24.253
- Well, I gotta go.

1:33:39.660 --> 1:33:44.240
- I can't do this, I can't do this.

1:33:49.383 --> 1:33:50.890
I can't, I just...

1:33:52.160 --> 1:33:52.993
- Are you okay?

1:33:54.380 --> 1:33:55.780
- Yes, I'm fine.

1:33:55.780 --> 1:33:57.080
- Who are you here to see?

1:33:57.970 --> 1:33:59.470
- Terrance Taylor.

1:33:59.470 --> 1:34:01.410
- That's his room right there.

1:34:01.410 --> 1:34:02.243
- Thank you.

1:34:05.291 --> 1:34:07.708
(soft music)

1:34:14.810 --> 1:34:17.963
Lord, please give me the
strength to do Your will,

1:34:19.010 --> 1:34:20.010
in Jesus name, amen.

1:34:29.056 --> 1:34:30.806
- [Terrance] Come in.

1:34:35.930 --> 1:34:37.465
- Who is she?

1:34:37.465 --> 1:34:39.130
- You came.

1:34:39.130 --> 1:34:41.773
- Hey, yeah, I guess so.

1:34:43.420 --> 1:34:45.920
- Hello, who is she?

1:34:45.920 --> 1:34:49.370
- Look, Jackie, this is
Shantel, Shantel, this Jackie.

1:34:49.370 --> 1:34:50.450
- Shantel?
- Hey, Jackie.

1:34:50.450 --> 1:34:52.360
- You are not even supposed to be here.

1:34:52.360 --> 1:34:53.814
- Look, nah, it's cool, I want her here.

1:34:53.814 --> 1:34:54.754
- You want her here?

1:34:54.754 --> 1:34:55.587
- Yeah.

1:34:55.587 --> 1:34:56.420
- You want her here?

1:34:56.420 --> 1:34:57.750
The dreaded Shantel,

1:34:57.750 --> 1:35:00.963
the one that I had to hear so much about.

1:35:00.963 --> 1:35:01.796
- Jackie.

1:35:01.796 --> 1:35:02.790
- How she broke your heart.

1:35:02.790 --> 1:35:07.790
Oh, oh, and let's not forget
how she, she, she got you shot.

1:35:09.150 --> 1:35:12.560
This, this is what you want?

1:35:12.560 --> 1:35:13.733
- I'm just here to pray for him.

1:35:13.733 --> 1:35:17.120
- I don't give a, you know what?

1:35:17.120 --> 1:35:18.173
I almost.

1:35:19.080 --> 1:35:20.870
You, you!

1:35:20.870 --> 1:35:21.703
- Jackie.

1:35:21.703 --> 1:35:25.899
- If you want her here, you
definitely don't want me here.

1:35:25.899 --> 1:35:26.732
- Jackie.

1:35:26.732 --> 1:35:31.370
- No, no, you got me in here
looking like a darn fool.

1:35:31.370 --> 1:35:34.470
Sister coming in here so you
just forget about everything.

1:35:34.470 --> 1:35:35.840
Yeah, you know what?

1:35:35.840 --> 1:35:37.730
She coming to pray, she better pray.

1:35:37.730 --> 1:35:39.952
You better pray I don't come back

1:35:39.952 --> 1:35:42.712
and mess all y'all up in here,
that's what you better do.

1:35:42.712 --> 1:35:45.129
(soft music)

1:36:00.767 --> 1:36:02.122
- I pray, Jesus, I ask that you.

1:36:02.122 --> 1:36:03.880
(praying softly)

1:36:03.880 --> 1:36:05.830
- Look, I'm sorry about that.

1:36:08.320 --> 1:36:10.700
But, I'm glad you came.

1:36:10.700 --> 1:36:14.060
- It wasn't easy, I turned
around several times,

1:36:14.060 --> 1:36:15.960
and I thought about not coming at all.

1:36:17.432 --> 1:36:19.320
- Well, I'm glad you did.

1:36:19.320 --> 1:36:21.193
- Well, thank the Lord.

1:36:24.200 --> 1:36:25.079
He even gave me--

1:36:25.079 --> 1:36:25.912
- Shantel.

1:36:29.950 --> 1:36:30.783
I'm dying.

1:36:37.160 --> 1:36:40.896
Every day life goes on, you know?

1:36:40.896 --> 1:36:41.729
And,

1:36:45.250 --> 1:36:47.103
mine grows shorter.

1:36:56.060 --> 1:36:57.170
- Well, do you wanna keep living

1:36:57.170 --> 1:36:58.770
the same way you've been living?

1:37:01.290 --> 1:37:02.123
- No.

1:37:03.060 --> 1:37:04.183
Not like this.

1:37:08.100 --> 1:37:10.653
- Well, do you wanna be
changed in Christ's image?

1:37:13.566 --> 1:37:16.343
- Shantel, I don't know, I
don't even know what that means.

1:37:17.490 --> 1:37:22.040
- You'll start to have peace
of mind, body, and soul.

1:37:22.040 --> 1:37:24.407
Heavy burdens will feel lifted off of you.

1:37:25.632 --> 1:37:28.417
And the warm love of
God will overtake you.

1:37:32.079 --> 1:37:33.679
- That's the peace in your eyes.

1:37:36.880 --> 1:37:38.650
And this whole time I
thought it was that pastor

1:37:38.650 --> 1:37:40.173
that made you feel like this.

1:37:41.561 --> 1:37:42.394
- No.

1:37:43.277 --> 1:37:44.110
It was Jesus.

1:37:46.544 --> 1:37:49.063
- That's what I need, I need Jesus.

1:37:50.823 --> 1:37:51.656
(crying)

1:37:51.656 --> 1:37:56.272
I don't know what to do, I need Him.

1:37:56.272 --> 1:37:58.022
I need that, Shantel.

1:37:59.366 --> 1:38:01.449
(crying)

1:38:13.967 --> 1:38:14.800
You okay?

1:38:19.012 --> 1:38:20.429
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1:38:29.583 --> 1:38:32.957
Do you accept Jesus Christ
as your Lord and savior?

1:38:34.720 --> 1:38:35.947
- I don't even know Him.

1:38:37.170 --> 1:38:39.710
- Well, I'm willing to
spend some time with you

1:38:39.710 --> 1:38:43.163
and teach you about Him, if you let me.

1:38:50.463 --> 1:38:52.720
- You don't think it's too late.

1:38:52.720 --> 1:38:55.867
- No, God has been waiting for you.

1:38:59.228 --> 1:39:00.061
- Yes,

1:39:01.460 --> 1:39:02.819
please teach me.

1:39:02.819 --> 1:39:04.159
- Okay.

1:39:04.159 --> 1:39:05.294
(crying)

1:39:05.294 --> 1:39:07.711
(soft music)

1:39:56.720 --> 1:39:58.820
- Does forgiveness really do that for you?

1:39:59.760 --> 1:40:00.593
- Do what?

1:40:01.500 --> 1:40:04.070
- Give you peace and joy like that?

1:40:04.070 --> 1:40:06.573
- Yes, that and much more.

1:40:13.360 --> 1:40:14.663
- Reverend Thomas,

1:40:17.130 --> 1:40:18.403
I forgive you.

1:40:21.345 --> 1:40:24.904
I forgive you!

1:40:24.904 --> 1:40:26.530
I forgive you!

1:40:26.530 --> 1:40:28.613
(crying)

1:40:32.774 --> 1:40:36.400
- I forgive you, (speaking
in foreign language)

1:40:36.400 --> 1:40:39.373
I know I haven't been a good daughter.

1:40:39.373 --> 1:40:41.488
You abused me and you left me.

1:40:41.488 --> 1:40:43.571
(crying)

1:40:44.946 --> 1:40:48.043
But I forgive you, I forgive you.

1:40:48.043 --> 1:40:53.043
- I just want my babies to
forgive me for leaving them.

1:40:54.270 --> 1:40:56.160
Do you think they'll forgive me?

1:40:56.160 --> 1:40:57.300
- Yes!

1:40:57.300 --> 1:41:00.480
You're their mother, your
heart will always beat for them

1:41:00.480 --> 1:41:02.510
and their heart for yours.

1:41:02.510 --> 1:41:05.210
They may be mad, but that's
only because they're hurt.

1:41:11.760 --> 1:41:15.730
- Shantel, I mean, I'm sorry,

1:41:15.730 --> 1:41:16.667
Mrs. Cross,

1:41:17.810 --> 1:41:19.133
I wanna be saved.

1:41:21.250 --> 1:41:23.983
I've always wanted a
relationship with God,

1:41:25.796 --> 1:41:27.367
but it was just so many people around me

1:41:27.367 --> 1:41:31.673
and I couldn't trust
anyone, but I trust you.

1:41:36.660 --> 1:41:38.260
- I need about 15 minutes.

1:41:46.360 --> 1:41:49.580
- Thank you, Lord,
hallelujah, Lord, thank you.

1:41:50.597 --> 1:41:52.527
Oh, I believe you, Lord,

1:41:52.527 --> 1:41:57.120
I receive it right now
God, in the name of Jesus.

1:41:57.120 --> 1:42:00.277
I receive it, I believe right now.

1:42:01.199 --> 1:42:02.376
- Thank you God.

1:42:02.376 --> 1:42:04.959
(all clapping)

1:42:08.101 --> 1:42:08.934
- You're going to heaven.

1:42:08.934 --> 1:42:11.700
(speaking in foreign language)

1:42:11.700 --> 1:42:12.617
- Right on.

1:42:17.730 --> 1:42:19.383
- Mrs. Cross, excuse me.

1:42:21.530 --> 1:42:26.530
You know, after all you been through

1:42:26.578 --> 1:42:30.373
I just can't believe
that you still got joy.

1:42:31.360 --> 1:42:35.423
- Still have joy, stupid, why
is English so hard for you?

1:42:36.470 --> 1:42:37.880
- Lisa, really?

1:42:39.140 --> 1:42:40.670
- I'm sorry.

1:42:40.670 --> 1:42:41.503
Hug.

1:42:43.500 --> 1:42:47.520
- That's okay, you can give
me a better apology later.

1:42:47.520 --> 1:42:48.887
- Get off me.
- Tonya.

1:42:48.887 --> 1:42:52.527
- [Tonya] I'm sorry, I was
just playing, I got joy now.

1:42:53.370 --> 1:42:54.800
- [Lisa] You crazy, you know that?

1:42:54.800 --> 1:42:57.740
- Well, there's more to the story.

1:42:57.740 --> 1:42:58.760
- What?

1:42:58.760 --> 1:43:00.940
- Next time I come I'll explain.

1:43:00.940 --> 1:43:01.803
- That's fine.

1:43:02.993 --> 1:43:07.318
I mean, I do wanna hear
more but, I'm okay.

1:43:07.318 --> 1:43:08.968
I mean, you're just gonna see me,

1:43:09.890 --> 1:43:12.483
I mean, come see us some more

1:43:12.483 --> 1:43:14.487
and talk to us, right?

1:43:14.487 --> 1:43:15.320
- Right.
