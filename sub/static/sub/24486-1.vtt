02:47.887 --> 02:50.557
Hey, now, Joe, hurry
up and save that thing!

02:56.663 --> 02:58.798
Now get in the car
before we all get killed!

03:02.135 --> 03:03.536
I always try
to hold onto the feeling

03:03.637 --> 03:05.639
I had when I was six.

03:05.739 --> 03:07.941
How excited I was.

03:08.041 --> 03:08.975
Did you see that thing?

03:09.075 --> 03:10.610
Saved another turtle!

03:10.710 --> 03:11.978
He doesn't care, Joe!

03:12.078 --> 03:13.513
The kid has one
thing on his brain!

03:13.613 --> 03:15.315
You know, Gator Land
could sure use my skills.

03:17.517 --> 03:18.685
The turtle okay?

03:18.785 --> 03:22.689
Hell's bells, Joe, just
drive, for God's sake.

03:24.024 --> 03:26.826
There will be no Hoppy
if you do not sit down!

03:26.926 --> 03:30.530
We will get to Old Time
Fun Town, all together!

03:30.630 --> 03:32.932
Now, no amount
of turtles or armadillos

03:33.033 --> 03:35.602
or any potential roadkill
could top what was to come.

03:40.707 --> 03:42.809
Sit down right now, buckle up,

03:42.909 --> 03:45.679
be quiet, or we are
turning this van around!

03:47.013 --> 03:49.049
Oh, that's not me.

03:49.149 --> 03:51.985
That's just some random kid
that has what I once had,

03:52.085 --> 03:54.988
that oh-so-fantastic feeling
I'm still desperately

03:55.088 --> 03:56.623
trying to hold onto.

03:56.723 --> 04:00.694
Old Time Fun
Town is now open for business.

04:08.435 --> 04:09.169
Freeze!

04:18.244 --> 04:21.314
Yep, that's me.

04:21.414 --> 04:23.016
Get down, get down!

04:28.421 --> 04:29.956
Hell's bells, Joe!

have a happy day

04:33.960 --> 04:36.229

04:41.801 --> 04:44.704

all right, okay.

04:44.804 --> 04:45.939
Sit down!

04:54.948 --> 04:57.117
Come on, let's go.

04:58.318 --> 05:00.220
I have a long history
of humiliating myself

05:00.320 --> 05:02.722
in front of other people.

05:02.822 --> 05:05.492
There was that one time
in Mr. Cupper's class,

05:05.592 --> 05:07.794
during a fascinating
science lesson,

05:07.894 --> 05:09.662
where my habit of eating
breakfast burritos

05:09.763 --> 05:11.931
finally caught up with me.

05:13.266 --> 05:15.068
Knowing this was going
to be a thunderbolt

05:15.168 --> 05:17.303
and I only had
seconds till ignition,

05:17.404 --> 05:19.139
I quickly devised a plan

05:19.239 --> 05:21.841
to brilliantly use today's
lesson of cause and effect.

05:23.510 --> 05:25.845
I would simply drop
the book onto the floor

05:25.945 --> 05:30.016
and time my release
perfectly with the loud bang.

05:47.901 --> 05:49.335
Nice one, Pooter!

05:51.104 --> 05:53.506
Well, you know what they say,

05:53.606 --> 05:55.275
timing is everything.

05:55.375 --> 05:59.279
So I really should start at
the beginning of this summer.

05:59.379 --> 06:00.180
AA degree!

06:00.280 --> 06:02.849
Yeah, we did it, Pooter!

06:02.949 --> 06:04.350
It's Tucker.

06:04.451 --> 06:06.286
I mean, you don't have to
keep calling me Pooter.

06:06.386 --> 06:07.620
Hey, uh, Amber.

06:08.521 --> 06:10.523
Congratulations.

06:10.623 --> 06:11.458
Aw...

06:12.425 --> 06:13.560
Thanks, Pooter.

06:15.528 --> 06:16.362
Pooter!

06:18.331 --> 06:19.299
What?

06:20.233 --> 06:21.067
What?

06:22.302 --> 06:24.971
You're a weird guy, Pooter.

06:29.008 --> 06:31.010
Tucker, oh!

06:31.110 --> 06:34.581
My little Tucker, oh,
come here, my baby boy.

06:34.681 --> 06:36.082
Oh, we're so proud!

06:36.182 --> 06:37.717
You'd think I'd
won the Nobel Peace Prize,

06:37.817 --> 06:39.586
as far as my mom was concerned.

06:39.686 --> 06:40.520
Oh, hi!

06:40.620 --> 06:41.988
Here, here, take our picture!

06:42.088 --> 06:43.456
One last little
embarrassment for the road,

06:43.556 --> 06:46.960
topped off by the classic
Ostrowski family picture pose.

06:47.060 --> 06:50.163
Smile!

06:51.631 --> 06:53.099
Junior college was behind me,

06:53.199 --> 06:57.370
and with a clean slate, I
was off to pursue my dream.

07:09.816 --> 07:11.451
♪ The only way to get there

07:11.551 --> 07:14.053
♪ Is to take that step

07:14.154 --> 07:16.823
♪ To the other side of life

07:16.923 --> 07:20.059
Yep, things were finally
gonna happen for me.

07:20.160 --> 07:22.195
I got accepted into CalArts,

07:22.295 --> 07:24.597
the school Walt
Disney himself built,

07:24.697 --> 07:26.332
and the only place that
could nurture my love

07:26.432 --> 07:29.869
of animation, theme
park design, and music.

07:29.969 --> 07:32.071
Call me retro, but
I can't get enough

07:32.171 --> 07:35.341
of groups like the
Who, the Moody Blues.

07:35.441 --> 07:37.844
Just one little downside
to my whole plan...

07:37.944 --> 07:40.780
My parents filed for personal
bankruptcy last week.

07:42.448 --> 07:43.683
Gosh.

07:43.783 --> 07:45.218
Hi, Tucker, dear, your
dad and I are heading

07:45.318 --> 07:47.086
over to Pawn Road on 192.

07:47.187 --> 07:47.921
Again?

07:48.021 --> 07:49.656
Do you want to come?

07:49.756 --> 07:52.959
Okay, well, we're just going
to need to borrow a few things.

07:53.059 --> 07:55.728
Okay, get that, that
should cover the mortgage,

07:55.828 --> 07:58.665
and that, the cash from that
might cover the power and food.

07:58.765 --> 08:00.033
We need food.

08:00.133 --> 08:01.267
Bye, dear!

08:01.367 --> 08:02.402
Yeah, they have a great attitude

08:02.502 --> 08:04.003
about the situation,

08:04.103 --> 08:06.072
but it doesn't help
pay for CalArts.

08:06.172 --> 08:08.208
Now, you'd think that working
for Disney or Universal

08:08.308 --> 08:10.777
would be the natural
thing for me to do, right?

08:10.877 --> 08:13.279
But my other little
downside was,

08:13.379 --> 08:16.416
a few years back, I had
this great creative idea

08:16.516 --> 08:19.385
to produce an
Ostrowski mega-mural.

08:19.485 --> 08:21.254
But it kind of
pissed off the owner

08:21.354 --> 08:23.723
of the movie theater,
who called the cops.

08:23.823 --> 08:27.093
Looks like you're
going to jail, boy.

08:29.062 --> 08:30.430
And these days, the big parks

08:30.530 --> 08:33.332
do a little thing called
a background check.

08:33.433 --> 08:35.335
Turn right.

08:35.434 --> 08:36.602
Your other right.

08:36.703 --> 08:37.837
Now, I only had another two months

08:37.937 --> 08:40.073
before that got
wiped off my record,

08:40.173 --> 08:42.442
thanks to a little
community service,

08:42.542 --> 08:45.812
helping undo other people's art,

08:45.912 --> 08:47.780
but that didn't
help me at the time.

08:47.880 --> 08:51.484
I convinced myself, no
need to dwell on the past.

08:51.584 --> 08:53.886
Time to get out
there, get a job,

08:53.987 --> 08:56.322
and make some tuition money.

08:58.057 --> 08:58.891
Hm.

09:00.627 --> 09:01.427
Hm.

09:02.895 --> 09:03.630
Uh, well,

09:03.730 --> 09:05.098
cute.

09:05.198 --> 09:06.766
But we're architects here,

09:06.866 --> 09:10.136
and we just filled our
last summer intern slot.

09:10.236 --> 09:12.005
Oh, thank you, Amber.

09:14.507 --> 09:15.842
Amber Freeman?

09:16.843 --> 09:18.411
Bye, Pooter.

09:22.949 --> 09:25.385
Pontius, Ostroswki, Arnold.

09:26.219 --> 09:27.687
This is a tough job.

09:27.787 --> 09:29.689
It's gonna take
muscle and hard work.

09:29.789 --> 09:31.958
I got room for two of you.

09:35.628 --> 09:37.597
You don't have any
experience working

09:37.697 --> 09:39.932
Asian fusion kitchen like this.

09:43.770 --> 09:44.937
Thank you.

10:37.256 --> 10:38.091
Perfect.

10:40.293 --> 10:42.061
It was the job I'd
been looking for.

10:43.429 --> 10:46.199
Why hadn't I thought of
this in the first place?

10:46.299 --> 10:48.568
Working in a smaller theme park,

10:48.668 --> 10:50.169
getting to know the business
that would be my life

10:50.269 --> 10:52.472
without a pesky
background check.

10:52.572 --> 10:56.576
It ain't Disney, but I was
willing to do anything.

10:56.676 --> 10:57.510
Anything.

11:01.814 --> 11:05.051
Your skins are over
in the character room.

11:05.151 --> 11:06.552
Uh...

11:06.652 --> 11:09.388
Okay, thank you so
much, Mr. Lloyd.

11:09.489 --> 11:13.025
Uh, is there some kind of
orientation thing, or...

11:13.126 --> 11:14.393
You're orientated.

11:14.494 --> 11:16.028
You want the job or not?

11:16.129 --> 11:17.196
Absolutely!

11:18.731 --> 11:21.567
Uh, so just the
room right over...

11:22.468 --> 11:23.302
Okay.

11:24.570 --> 11:28.040
Yes, nailed the interview!

11:29.408 --> 11:32.745
It was goodbye resume,
hello lifelong career.

11:33.946 --> 11:35.515
As soon as I figured
out what a skin was.

11:46.192 --> 11:47.026
Hoppy.

11:51.831 --> 11:54.400
Oh, man, it is hot out there!

11:56.335 --> 11:58.371
Yo, you mind unzipping me, bro?

11:58.471 --> 11:59.338
Sure.

11:59.439 --> 12:00.773
This was a moment in my life

12:00.873 --> 12:02.675
that will forever be
burned into my senses.

12:04.577 --> 12:07.880
Unzipping that costume was
like opening a pressure cooker.

12:07.980 --> 12:10.283
When that steamed sweat hit me,

12:10.383 --> 12:13.152
I think I blacked
out for a minute.

12:13.252 --> 12:15.788
Oh, man, you're gonna get
used to that, don't worry.

12:15.888 --> 12:17.223
It's good to meet you.

12:17.323 --> 12:18.691
I'm Jerry, or as I'm
known around these parts,

12:18.791 --> 12:20.626
Captain Jack's Parrot.

12:21.828 --> 12:23.429
Captain Jack Sparrow?

12:23.529 --> 12:25.898
Oh, no, no, no, man, what,
are you trying to get us sued?

12:25.998 --> 12:28.801
It's Captain Jack's Parrot.

12:28.901 --> 12:30.069
It's a new character.

12:30.169 --> 12:32.205
I'm still working
on the name thing.

12:32.305 --> 12:33.940
Oh, uh, hi, Tucker.

12:36.042 --> 12:38.144
That Mr. Lloyd was worthless,

12:38.244 --> 12:41.380
but Jerry, he
showed me the ropes.

12:41.480 --> 12:43.449
Now Jerry got me started.

12:43.549 --> 12:44.817
How to suit up.

12:46.352 --> 12:48.421
How to move like the character.

12:48.521 --> 12:49.488
The schedule.

12:49.589 --> 12:50.723
Out for 30 minutes,

12:50.823 --> 12:53.426
then back in to
rest for 30 minutes.

12:53.526 --> 12:56.229
Now, sometimes, it's
easier to keep a costume on

12:56.329 --> 12:58.297
for your break than to go
through the whole process

12:58.397 --> 13:00.233
of putting on the feet,

13:00.333 --> 13:02.401
putting on the gloves,

13:02.501 --> 13:04.070
putting on the body.

13:05.905 --> 13:08.441
No, no, no, dude, no, no.

13:08.541 --> 13:10.076
Now, that's what
you do, all right?

13:10.176 --> 13:12.311
Now this is what you don't do.

13:12.411 --> 13:14.213
And I'm speaking
from experience.

13:14.313 --> 13:15.648
Son of a!

13:16.983 --> 13:19.852
Don't talk, it ruins
the illusion, man.

13:20.686 --> 13:22.488
Don't pick up the kids.

13:23.789 --> 13:25.157
They're slippery little suckers.

13:25.258 --> 13:27.026
If some kid shakes your
hand and tries to break it,

13:27.126 --> 13:29.395
do not squeeze back.

13:29.495 --> 13:30.630
Nah, never mind.

13:30.730 --> 13:31.998
Go ahead and bust
his little fingers.

13:34.300 --> 13:36.235
And remember, it
may sound corny,

13:36.335 --> 13:38.271
but most kids really
love the characters.

13:38.371 --> 13:41.207
We mean something to 'em,
so try to make it special.

13:41.307 --> 13:43.242
Jerry really knew his stuff.

13:43.342 --> 13:44.777
Not that he'd worked
here very long.

13:44.877 --> 13:46.379
This was just his second week,

13:46.479 --> 13:48.547
but I guess he'd
been a school mascot,

13:48.648 --> 13:51.217
the Fighting Aardvarks
or something like that.

13:53.019 --> 13:54.153
And in two weeks, he'd learned

13:54.253 --> 13:55.955
the Old Time Fun Town
characters' routine

13:56.055 --> 13:57.223
enough to help me out.

13:57.323 --> 13:58.224
Finally, it's your moment...

13:58.324 --> 13:59.425
Wait just a second, wait.

13:59.525 --> 14:00.626
How long do I stay in here?

14:00.726 --> 14:01.894
30 minutes, bro.

14:01.994 --> 14:03.796
Yeah, but how will I know
that my 30 minutes is up?

14:03.896 --> 14:06.465
There's a watch taped
inside of the head.

14:06.565 --> 14:07.833
What if I gotta sneeze?

14:07.934 --> 14:10.002
Man, you can't, no
reaching up under the neck,

14:10.102 --> 14:11.270
that just looks wrong.

14:11.370 --> 14:12.271
So suck it up!

14:12.371 --> 14:13.639
It's only 30 minutes!

14:13.739 --> 14:14.473
You can do it!

14:14.573 --> 14:15.308
Wait, wait!

14:15.408 --> 14:16.342
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

14:16.442 --> 14:17.510
Man, get out there!

14:17.610 --> 14:18.778
Okay, but doesn't somebody,
like, walk me around,

14:18.878 --> 14:19.779
like an escort?

14:19.879 --> 14:24.116
That's a good one.

14:24.216 --> 14:25.584
This is Old Time Fun Town.

14:25.685 --> 14:27.153
You're on your own.

14:45.271 --> 14:45.472
Oh, my God.

14:47.107 --> 14:48.542
I'm Hoppy.

15:06.727 --> 15:09.062
See ya, Pooter.

15:18.639 --> 15:19.373
Hoppy?

15:21.508 --> 15:22.943
Hoppy the Kangaroo was there

15:23.043 --> 15:25.245
in my hour of need.

15:25.345 --> 15:27.514
Thanks, Hoppy, you're awesome!

15:27.614 --> 15:29.650
And you're right, I
can be awesome too!

15:33.520 --> 15:34.354
I'm Hoppy.

15:36.056 --> 15:37.624
I'm Hoppy the Kangaroo.

15:37.724 --> 15:40.460
I'm Hoppy, I'm Hoppy, I'm Hoppy.

15:40.560 --> 15:41.294
G'day, mate.

15:42.229 --> 15:43.830
Hoppy the Kangaroo.

15:44.998 --> 15:47.134
Hoppy the Kangaroo,
I'm Hoppy, I'm Hoppy.

15:47.234 --> 15:49.136
You're Hoppy.

15:49.236 --> 15:51.605
It was time for me
to meet the people.

16:08.155 --> 16:12.225
I wasn't exactly sure
where I was supposed to go.

16:16.897 --> 16:19.066
Stop talking, keep moving.

16:30.277 --> 16:31.111
What?

16:31.211 --> 16:33.413
It had only been two minutes?

16:33.513 --> 16:34.481
28 more to go.

16:34.581 --> 16:35.415
Hoppy!

16:39.086 --> 16:40.320
Oh, how sweet!

16:40.420 --> 16:42.889
Let's get our picture
taken with the bunny!

16:42.989 --> 16:45.158
First lesson...
Kneel to the kid's level

16:45.258 --> 16:46.960
or pay the consequences.

16:47.060 --> 16:48.328
A kangaroo

16:48.428 --> 16:49.896
should always watch his sack.

16:53.867 --> 16:57.237
Ready, everybody, smile!

16:57.337 --> 16:58.905
Okay, are you ready?

16:59.005 --> 16:59.739
Say cheese!

16:59.840 --> 17:00.907
Ready, smile!

17:06.713 --> 17:09.415
Hoppy!

17:09.516 --> 17:10.817
Hoppy!

17:18.892 --> 17:20.160
Guys, look, it's a dog!

17:20.260 --> 17:22.095
It's not a dog,
it has long ears.

17:22.194 --> 17:23.563
Then it's gotta be
a rabbit, obviously,

17:23.663 --> 17:24.798
just look at its long ears.

17:24.897 --> 17:26.133
I know, I know what it is!

17:26.233 --> 17:27.099
No, you don't!

17:27.200 --> 17:28.300
Be quiet!

17:28.401 --> 17:29.436
Dogs can have long ears.

17:29.536 --> 17:30.537
It's gotta be a possum,

17:30.637 --> 17:32.706
I mean, look at its pockets.

17:32.806 --> 17:34.174
Dogs can have pockets?

17:34.274 --> 17:35.542
Yes, any...

17:35.642 --> 17:36.710
They'll argue over
anything, it doesn't matter.

17:36.810 --> 17:38.278
It's ridiculous!

17:38.378 --> 17:39.513
Can't you shut up already?

17:39.613 --> 17:40.780
Enough, already!

17:40.881 --> 17:42.949
Can't you tell it's an
armadillo, you morons?

17:43.049 --> 17:44.284
Just take the picture!

17:44.384 --> 17:46.486
Whatever!
Fine!

17:51.324 --> 17:52.993
Smile!

17:54.194 --> 17:56.530
Hoppy, can I have your autograph?

17:56.630 --> 18:00.467
Okay, I told
MYSELF: I can do this.

18:03.236 --> 18:04.437
Tucker?

18:04.538 --> 18:06.673
Lots of lessons that first day.

18:06.773 --> 18:08.909
Hoppy, Hoppy, come here.

18:09.009 --> 18:11.144
I had been out for 45 minutes.

18:11.244 --> 18:13.180
I had blown half of my break,

18:13.280 --> 18:15.315
and I didn't know how
to get out of there.

18:15.415 --> 18:17.851
All right,
everybody smile for the camera!

18:21.421 --> 18:22.756
Hoppy!

18:23.957 --> 18:25.792
Where'd he go?

18:31.531 --> 18:32.866
Yo, it's noon, man.

18:32.966 --> 18:34.835
Thanks for covering my shift.

18:36.703 --> 18:39.306
Now, get back out there,
it's your turn again!

18:41.341 --> 18:43.743
Yo, I'm just kidding.

18:43.844 --> 18:46.580
But you gotta manage your
time, plan your escapes.

18:46.680 --> 18:49.349
You're gonna die out there, man!

18:56.923 --> 18:58.425
Yo, sports drinks will be
your friend, my brother.

19:02.362 --> 19:03.196
Okay.

19:07.467 --> 19:09.502
You gotta remember to
eat something, too, man.

19:09.603 --> 19:10.704
I don't think I can.

19:10.804 --> 19:12.239
Well, go ahead and hurl,
we got a whole department

19:12.339 --> 19:13.573
here to take care of spew.

19:13.673 --> 19:17.544
Yo, come back, guys, we got
a protein spill in progress.

19:18.712 --> 19:21.848
Oh, man, they must
have the worst jobs.

19:23.383 --> 19:24.517
Nope.

19:24.618 --> 19:26.019
It is debatable that
most people think

19:26.119 --> 19:27.654
that we actually have the
worst jobs in the park.

19:27.754 --> 19:30.023
Yo, Kangaroo, meet Bear.

19:30.123 --> 19:31.791
I'm Stu, I'm a
colorful polar bear.

19:31.892 --> 19:32.759
Yo, say it right.

19:32.859 --> 19:34.561
I'm Paws, the Pink Polar Bear!

19:34.661 --> 19:36.663
Nice to meet you, uh, Tucker.

19:36.763 --> 19:37.597
Or Hoppy?

19:39.199 --> 19:40.300
How many of us are there?

19:40.400 --> 19:42.369
Well, right now, there's
just the four of us.

19:42.469 --> 19:45.705
It's me, you, Stu, and
Sam, who's off today.

19:45.805 --> 19:48.508
Sam's actually
Bowser the Bulldog.

19:48.608 --> 19:49.910
Uh, Bowser the Bulldog.

19:50.010 --> 19:52.045
What's the, uh, what's
the pecking order?

19:52.145 --> 19:54.614
Well, there's the
janitors, right, George?

19:54.714 --> 19:56.182
My man!

19:56.283 --> 19:58.852
Then there's us, the scum at
the bottom of the scum pit.

19:58.952 --> 19:59.953
Then there's food service.

20:00.053 --> 20:00.954
They're pretty low,

20:01.054 --> 20:02.088
but they do get free food.

20:04.424 --> 20:05.592
Then there's merchandise.

20:05.692 --> 20:07.060
They won't speak
to you, by the way.

20:07.160 --> 20:08.328
Yeah, in order to
work in merchandise,

20:08.428 --> 20:10.030
You gotta have the three P's:

20:10.130 --> 20:12.699
Pretty, pretty bored,

20:12.799 --> 20:14.467
pretty pissy.

20:14.567 --> 20:16.303
Then after that, it's the
one group I actually like...

20:16.403 --> 20:17.470
The landscapers.

20:17.570 --> 20:18.705
They not only
handle the greenery

20:18.805 --> 20:20.407
but take care of the
petting zoo also.

20:21.675 --> 20:23.943
Yo, and those guys,
they're crazy.

20:25.512 --> 20:28.615
I think it's because
they grow their own.

20:34.354 --> 20:35.555
Aw, man!

20:35.655 --> 20:38.224
They look identical.

20:38.325 --> 20:41.494
No, yes, maybe.

20:41.594 --> 20:43.163
Poop roulette!

20:43.263 --> 20:45.131
Poop candy, no, no.
Try it?

20:45.231 --> 20:46.132
How about you?

20:46.232 --> 20:47.100
No, I'm good, man.

20:47.200 --> 20:47.867
Try it?

20:47.968 --> 20:48.702
Oh, yeah.

20:48.802 --> 20:49.536
Come on.

20:50.570 --> 20:51.338
Who's a good boy?

20:51.438 --> 20:54.240
Uh oh.

21:04.551 --> 21:06.987
So who's at the top
of the food chain?

21:07.087 --> 21:08.722
Are you an animator?

21:08.822 --> 21:11.658
Oh, no, I mean, kind of I am.

21:11.758 --> 21:14.227
Uh, not, nobody
would pay for this,

21:14.327 --> 21:15.228
but, I, uh,

21:16.396 --> 21:18.198
you know, what I
really want to do?

21:18.298 --> 21:19.366
What's that?

21:19.466 --> 21:20.867
I want to be a
theme park designer.

21:20.967 --> 21:23.603
You know, like design
lands and dark rides.

21:23.703 --> 21:24.571
Nice, man.

21:24.671 --> 21:26.773
Yeah, thank you, definitely.

21:26.873 --> 21:27.807
Uh, so, uh,

21:30.276 --> 21:32.045
so who's at the top
of the food chain?

21:37.984 --> 21:40.720
The operations team runs this park,

21:40.820 --> 21:43.456
Ops, they run the rides,
they set the schedule,

21:43.556 --> 21:46.893
and report all activities
to the general manager.

21:46.993 --> 21:48.928
They are total control freaks.

21:50.130 --> 21:52.499
You got something to say, boys?

21:52.599 --> 21:55.135
No, uh, no, we're
good, yeah, we're good.

21:55.235 --> 21:57.137
Because you're stinking
up the break area.

21:57.237 --> 21:59.606
Why don't you head back to
your sweaty little closet?

21:59.706 --> 22:00.507
Yes, sir,

22:00.607 --> 22:01.574
um, Richard.

22:02.675 --> 22:03.543
Can we call you Dick?

22:11.084 --> 22:13.586
Yo, those guys are dicks.

22:13.686 --> 22:14.821
They're douchebags.

22:14.921 --> 22:16.089
Yeah, but there's no
complaining about it,

22:16.189 --> 22:17.490
'cause they're in
tight with the GM.

22:17.590 --> 22:19.559
Don't piss off
the GM, he's Khan.

22:19.659 --> 22:21.060
He's Vader.

22:21.161 --> 22:23.863
No, he's like Darth Vader's
boss, um, you know, uh...

22:23.963 --> 22:24.798
Palpatine.

22:24.898 --> 22:28.234
Emperor Palpatine, yeah.

22:29.736 --> 22:31.438
The general manager
of Old Time Fun Town

22:31.538 --> 22:33.706
was Benjamin Fletcher.

22:33.807 --> 22:35.241
Not so much the evil ruler

22:35.341 --> 22:37.710
of the Galactic Empire,

22:37.811 --> 22:40.747
but there was something about
this guy that seemed shady.

22:47.587 --> 22:50.757
It may have been how he added
a Y to every employee's name.

22:50.857 --> 22:53.259
Susy, Johnny, Sally, Annie,

22:54.594 --> 22:55.762
Bobby, Scotty,

22:57.197 --> 22:58.798
Georgie, pick that up.

22:58.898 --> 23:00.467
But I'll give him one thing...

23:00.567 --> 23:02.268
He knew everyone's name.

23:02.368 --> 23:05.104
I mean, everyone's name.

23:05.205 --> 23:06.573
That is impressive.

23:06.673 --> 23:08.374
Creepy, but impressive.

23:08.475 --> 23:09.709
Jeffrey!

23:09.809 --> 23:11.277
Ha, ha, nice try, kid.

23:11.377 --> 23:12.979
One more balloon, you
would have won a prize.

23:13.079 --> 23:14.280
Wanna try again?

23:14.380 --> 23:15.949
Five bucks.

23:16.049 --> 23:17.784
This guy was King Rat.

23:17.884 --> 23:20.253
He had all kinds of
connections who met with him

23:20.353 --> 23:22.455
once a week for a
high-stakes poker game.

23:22.555 --> 23:26.259
I'll see your 35
redemption tickets

23:26.359 --> 23:27.861
and I'll raise you

23:28.828 --> 23:30.330
a blue whale.

23:30.430 --> 23:32.665
I'm out.

23:32.765 --> 23:34.000
Out.

23:34.100 --> 23:34.934
All in.

23:35.034 --> 23:35.869
Jerry said he knew

23:35.969 --> 23:38.104
some really notorious types.

23:39.138 --> 23:40.874
Read 'em and weep.

23:40.974 --> 23:43.276
I need to buy back in.

23:43.376 --> 23:45.445
Well, then, I suggest
you hit the skee-ball.

23:48.047 --> 23:49.215
Ready, smile!

23:49.315 --> 23:50.984
But as far as I was concerned,

23:51.084 --> 23:53.052
he had dreamed up the
characters program here.

23:53.153 --> 23:54.454
Okay, smile!

23:54.554 --> 23:56.756
And without him,
I wouldn't have a job.

23:56.856 --> 23:59.692
A little closer, smile!

23:59.792 --> 24:02.228
I want to see your teeth, smile!

24:02.328 --> 24:04.197
Smile.

24:04.297 --> 24:05.932
Okay, smile.

24:06.032 --> 24:07.667
Smile!

24:07.767 --> 24:09.769
Smile.

24:09.869 --> 24:12.739
How was your first day of work, honey?

24:15.441 --> 24:17.110
Tucker, we sold
the bed to keep us

24:17.210 --> 24:18.811
in the house for another week.

24:18.912 --> 24:21.147
I've got the couch
all set up for you.

24:28.288 --> 24:29.389
Hey, I can't believe
you came back

24:29.489 --> 24:30.657
for a second day,
man, how you feeling?

24:30.757 --> 24:31.925
I'm all right.

24:32.025 --> 24:35.795
I just feel like I got
lockjaw or something.

24:35.895 --> 24:37.230
Lockjaw?

24:37.330 --> 24:38.998
Are you smiling every time
someone takes a picture of you?

24:39.098 --> 24:41.634
Are you smiling every
time someone takes a picture?

24:41.734 --> 24:43.670
I blame my parents for this.

24:43.770 --> 24:45.138
They had me trained
at a young age

24:45.238 --> 24:47.473
to show my teeth every
time a picture was taken.

24:47.574 --> 24:49.475
I had the same stupid
smile on my face

24:49.576 --> 24:53.079
from birth to graduation
and I was holding that face

24:53.179 --> 24:55.615
for eight hours in
a kangaroo suit.

24:55.715 --> 24:59.452
Yes, can I help you?

24:59.552 --> 25:01.087
Uh, yes, Ma'am, I'm Daryl Meyers

25:01.187 --> 25:02.589
from the Scare Zone attraction.

25:02.689 --> 25:03.856
Welcome to our
mansion, there's a...

25:03.957 --> 25:07.360
Okay, double, um, I have
a family to get home to.

25:07.460 --> 25:08.995
Actually, no, just...

25:09.095 --> 25:11.364
You two idiots are...

25:11.464 --> 25:12.932
Unsuspecting victims that are...

25:13.032 --> 25:14.601
Screwed, and you don't even...

25:14.701 --> 25:15.735
Know it.

25:15.835 --> 25:16.569
Now let's go to the...

25:16.669 --> 25:17.770
It's my 30, I'm up.

25:17.870 --> 25:19.072
Where you going?

25:19.172 --> 25:20.540
Gotta go out the main drag.

25:20.640 --> 25:22.375
Hey, zip me up, will you?
A string

25:22.475 --> 25:24.444
Sure. Of daring daylight robberies.

25:24.544 --> 25:25.578
Thanks, man.
Yeah.

25:25.678 --> 25:26.813
Investigators baffled.

25:26.913 --> 25:28.581
Elaborately disguised
is the only description

25:28.681 --> 25:30.350
Detective Michael
Arafat released

25:30.450 --> 25:32.085
in a statement calling
them serial bandits.

25:32.185 --> 25:33.620
Oh, hey, I've got a question.

25:33.720 --> 25:35.154
What's up, man?

25:36.222 --> 25:37.557
Why are we characters
start at nine,

25:37.657 --> 25:39.192
but this park
didn't open till 10?

25:39.292 --> 25:41.628
Oh, well, we gotta go out
the main drag and advertise.

25:41.728 --> 25:42.895
Huh.

25:42.996 --> 25:44.397
Yeah.

25:44.497 --> 25:47.934
Oh, like the guy on the
corner dressed as an enchilada

25:48.034 --> 25:48.935
promoting the Fuzzy Taco.

25:49.035 --> 25:50.169
You got it, Smiley, yeah.

25:50.269 --> 25:51.337
Oh.

25:51.437 --> 25:53.006
Hey, now help Sam
out the Bowser costume.

25:53.106 --> 25:54.140
I'll catch you later.

25:54.240 --> 25:55.074
Okay.

25:58.544 --> 25:59.879
Hi, Sam.

25:59.979 --> 26:02.582
Uh, Tucker.

26:02.682 --> 26:03.416
Uh, okay.

26:03.516 --> 26:04.684
Front.

26:04.784 --> 26:08.154
Sorry, uh, I'm new
here, I didn't...

26:08.254 --> 26:10.456
I didn't realize that some of
these unzip from the, whoa!

26:12.558 --> 26:13.693
Shocking, aren't they?

26:13.793 --> 26:14.927
I try to flatten
out these suckers,

26:15.028 --> 26:18.698
but there's always one
kid that finds them.

26:18.798 --> 26:19.999
Uh,

26:20.099 --> 26:21.234
I'm so sorry.

26:21.334 --> 26:24.003
Jerry, Jerry mentioned
that a Sam worked here.

26:24.103 --> 26:25.672
I didn't, I didn't think that...

26:25.772 --> 26:26.906
That a girl could do this?

26:27.006 --> 26:29.442
Well, that a girl
would want to do...

26:29.542 --> 26:30.510
Oh, I love it.

26:30.610 --> 26:31.711
All this sweat?

26:31.811 --> 26:33.713
I haven't gained a
pound since I started.

26:33.813 --> 26:37.417
I mean, I can eat
whatever I want, kind of.

26:40.019 --> 26:43.256
Uh, you're, like, you're
full-time here, then?

26:43.356 --> 26:44.490
No, part-time.

26:44.590 --> 26:46.426
My real job is dealing
with some other kids

26:46.526 --> 26:47.860
down the street at
the Haven House.

26:47.960 --> 26:51.230
You love working with children.

26:51.330 --> 26:52.331
All kinds.

26:53.299 --> 26:55.034
Mm-hm, oh, yeah.

26:56.369 --> 26:57.403
Yo, guys, we just
got an all-call.

26:58.771 --> 27:00.373
I didn't know what an all-call was,

27:00.473 --> 27:02.608
but it seemed important
and dangerous.

27:02.709 --> 27:06.379
As we rushed forward like lemmings
towards an uncertain fate

27:06.479 --> 27:08.815
I felt like I was
in the Hunger Games,

27:08.915 --> 27:10.516
heading to the reaping.

27:10.616 --> 27:11.584
Okay, so the GM wants to talk

27:11.684 --> 27:13.186
to all of us about something.

27:13.286 --> 27:15.288
I'm told when he does this,
it's usually something major.

27:34.874 --> 27:36.809
Pop, pop, popsicles.

27:36.909 --> 27:38.978
Ice, ice, icicles, test, test,

27:39.078 --> 27:40.913
testing one-two-three.

27:42.415 --> 27:43.816
Nice one, boss.

27:54.193 --> 27:56.395
Introducing the general manager

27:56.496 --> 27:58.798
of Old Time Fun
Town Enterprises,

27:58.898 --> 28:00.733
Mr. Benjamin Fletcher!

28:04.570 --> 28:06.472
Thank you, thank you.

28:11.844 --> 28:13.913
Looks like you have many
park employees here today,

28:14.013 --> 28:14.847
and that

28:16.048 --> 28:17.383
is just awesome.

28:18.518 --> 28:19.786
Since the park will
be opening soon,

28:19.886 --> 28:21.821
I'll keep my remarks brief.

28:21.921 --> 28:24.624
When I joined you as
general manager last summer,

28:24.724 --> 28:27.226
my goal was to
increase attendance

28:27.326 --> 28:30.163
by offering quality
games, rides, food,

28:30.263 --> 28:32.999
and merchandise to
our park guests.

28:33.099 --> 28:35.535
Hey, man, just filter out
the massive amounts of BS

28:35.635 --> 28:36.903
and you'll get the gist
of what he's saying.

28:37.003 --> 28:39.872
Per caps increased
by a respectable margin

28:39.972 --> 28:44.443
and monthly projections
met annual expectations.

28:44.544 --> 28:45.678
And through my efforts,

28:45.778 --> 28:47.113
we did about the same attendance

28:47.213 --> 28:49.282
as we did the year before.

28:49.382 --> 28:53.152
Now, I justified it to
our board of directors,

28:53.252 --> 28:56.322
that their investments
probably stopped a down-turn

28:56.422 --> 29:00.126
in attendance and that
breaking even was a good thing.

29:00.226 --> 29:03.362
Well, they bought that,
but that did not get me my

29:03.462 --> 29:06.299
much-deserved
bonus, so this year,

29:07.500 --> 29:10.703
I've devised a plan to
cash in on this place.

29:13.639 --> 29:14.807
Well, he's motivated.

29:14.907 --> 29:16.609
Yeah, he's a piece of work,

29:16.709 --> 29:19.011
but I am liking
those t-shirt girls.

29:20.313 --> 29:23.983
Okay, I can sum up
that plan in one word:

29:24.083 --> 29:25.251
Entertainment.

29:26.719 --> 29:30.089
As you know, Old Time Fun
Town was a successful park

29:30.189 --> 29:31.691
about 15 years ago when they

29:31.791 --> 29:35.294
introduced Hoppy the
Kangaroo and Friends.

29:38.297 --> 29:41.534
Since Hoppy's tragically
untimely death

29:42.735 --> 29:43.970
12 years ago...

29:47.807 --> 29:49.575
See ya, Pooter.

29:53.679 --> 29:54.914
Hoppy?

30:00.186 --> 30:02.121
Hoppy?

30:04.357 --> 30:06.993
Hoppy?

30:07.093 --> 30:09.395
Thanks, Hoppy, you're awesome!

30:09.495 --> 30:12.832
And you're right, I
can be awesome, too!

30:15.701 --> 30:19.872
And there hasn't been a
character in this park since,

30:20.806 --> 30:21.641
until this

30:22.642 --> 30:24.010
summer!

30:24.110 --> 30:26.979
After hundreds of applicants
and grueling auditions,

30:27.079 --> 30:30.182
we have assembled the new
Old Time Fun Town Characterz,

30:30.283 --> 30:31.117
with a Z.

30:34.887 --> 30:36.822
My grueling audition
is that I showed up.

30:36.923 --> 30:38.057
Yeah, mine too.

30:38.157 --> 30:41.227
Jerry, Sam, Tucky,
come on up here.

30:42.361 --> 30:44.363
There, Sammy, over here.

30:46.532 --> 30:47.633
Where is Stuey?

30:47.733 --> 30:48.901
Oh, he's off today.

30:49.001 --> 30:51.404
No, no, I'm here, I'm
here, I'm here, sorry.

30:51.504 --> 30:54.373
Even on my day off,
I'm that dedicated.

30:54.473 --> 30:55.241
You're standing in my light.

30:55.341 --> 30:56.442
Sorry, sir.

30:57.810 --> 31:01.714
Introducing Hoppy!

31:03.049 --> 31:06.485
Newly designed by our fabulous
in-house art director,

31:06.585 --> 31:08.120
Don Cluff.

31:08.220 --> 31:10.723
Donnie for old Walt, uh, what,

31:10.823 --> 31:13.059
maybe a hundred years
ago or so, Donnie?

31:13.159 --> 31:17.763
Yeah, Walt is dead and I'm
not feeling so good myself.

31:17.863 --> 31:19.632
Artist turned animator

31:19.732 --> 31:22.535
turned theme park
designer extraordinaire,

31:22.635 --> 31:26.806
who took my simple vision
and turned it into wonder,

31:28.207 --> 31:31.844
smothered it in magic, and
sprinkled it with pixie dust.

31:33.012 --> 31:35.014
And the rest of
the Kangaroo Krew,

31:35.114 --> 31:39.452
spelled with a K, of course,
Cap' Jack the Parrot!

31:39.552 --> 31:41.620
Man, I knew he'd screw that up.

31:41.721 --> 31:46.592
Bowser the Bulldog, and
Paws the Pink Polar Bear.

31:46.692 --> 31:51.097
So let's put our hands together
for the new Kangaroo Krew!

31:53.632 --> 31:55.901
These characters
will be everywhere

31:56.002 --> 31:58.504
doing promotional
visits, TV spots,

31:58.604 --> 32:01.540
and even a parade
through the park.

32:02.608 --> 32:04.010
A parade of four characters?

32:04.110 --> 32:06.245
Man, that sounds like
a death march to me.

32:06.345 --> 32:09.582
This is all to support this
summer's marketing slogan:

32:09.682 --> 32:13.986
"Have a whale of a time
at Old Time Fun Town."

32:14.086 --> 32:15.755
Had to cap it off,
well, to be honest,

32:15.855 --> 32:18.658
this was really Donnie's idea.

32:18.758 --> 32:22.428
Donnie, come up and
tell them your big idea.

32:24.196 --> 32:25.031
Oh.

32:26.966 --> 32:29.735
I said, "Now, you
want me to design

32:29.835 --> 32:32.405
"you a freaking whale costume?"

32:35.007 --> 32:36.509
Brilliant, yeah.

32:38.978 --> 32:41.247
And now for the big reveal.

32:42.748 --> 32:43.816
Wanna get out of here?

32:46.385 --> 32:47.520
Girls?

32:54.226 --> 32:57.630
Whoever can handle this
costume gets a 10% raise.

32:57.730 --> 32:59.131
Good luck.

32:59.231 --> 33:01.000
And introducing our
newest character

33:01.100 --> 33:03.569
and marketing opportunity:

33:03.669 --> 33:06.172
Doby Mick, the Big Blue Whale!

33:08.007 --> 33:09.341
Doby Mick will be premiering

33:09.442 --> 33:12.244
at the park's Fourth
of July celebrations.

33:12.344 --> 33:14.246
So who wants a t-shirt?

33:34.935 --> 33:36.269
Toby the Whale?

33:36.369 --> 33:38.972
No, no, no, man, it's
Doby Mick the Whale, get it?

33:39.072 --> 33:40.240
Wait, are we still
the Kangaroo Krew

33:40.340 --> 33:41.908
or is the whale
running stuff now?

33:42.008 --> 33:43.543
Um, separate checks, please.

33:43.643 --> 33:45.412
Oh, like we're Moby's dicks,

33:45.512 --> 33:47.047
like, he's Moby and we're
dicks and that's how the...

33:47.147 --> 33:49.249
No, no, Stu, you still don't,

33:49.349 --> 33:50.984
it's Doby, forget it, man.

33:51.084 --> 33:53.553
Hey, uh, where's Sam?

33:53.653 --> 33:55.722
Ooh, Sam.

33:55.822 --> 33:57.991
Samantha, ooh, ooh, ooh.

♪ When Sam came into your life

34:03.663 --> 34:04.498

How goes it at your little park?

34:11.138 --> 34:12.371
Who was that?

34:12.472 --> 34:13.607
Just one of the most successful

34:13.706 --> 34:14.841
costume characters
in the business.

34:14.940 --> 34:16.342
Where was your comeback, man?

34:16.443 --> 34:19.212
Stu, he's head of the union.

34:19.312 --> 34:21.047
I'm not working for a whale.

34:21.148 --> 34:23.984
Better than working for a mouse.

34:33.693 --> 34:34.761
Let's do this.

34:36.763 --> 34:37.764
♪ I sense the room goin' tight

Little crew is not

35:11.097 --> 35:12.532
We need a ringer.

35:21.441 --> 35:25.245
Franklin Jefferson Washington.

35:25.345 --> 35:27.914
Legend had it this guy was
a pro basketball player

35:28.014 --> 35:29.382
that got injured.

35:29.482 --> 35:33.420
Oh, yeah!

35:35.422 --> 35:37.557
Then he became
the team's mascot,

35:37.657 --> 35:39.593
a huge Brahma Bull.

35:39.693 --> 35:41.895
He became so popular
that the Mouse House

35:41.995 --> 35:46.166
stole him away to play one of
their tall core characters.

35:48.335 --> 35:52.505
Then he went off to start
his own delivery business.

35:53.940 --> 35:56.543
The only reason he would
possibly be doing this job

35:56.643 --> 36:01.514
is that he owed Fletcher a ton
of money in gambling debts.

36:01.615 --> 36:03.149
If he was forced to be here,

36:03.250 --> 36:05.619
you'd never know it.
Oh, yeah.

36:05.719 --> 36:07.153
He was that cool.

36:10.857 --> 36:12.192
Let's do this.

36:13.360 --> 36:15.128
Even his voice was cool.

36:31.011 --> 36:31.845
Wow.

36:32.946 --> 36:35.148
This guy's a machine.

36:59.873 --> 37:01.641
At that moment,

37:01.741 --> 37:03.209
I resolved to be
a better character

37:03.310 --> 37:06.112
for the next group of
kids that came along.

37:07.647 --> 37:10.884
That's when I first
encountered the Red Tide.

37:15.422 --> 37:17.657
During weekdays, Fletcher
would let day campers

37:17.757 --> 37:19.759
into the park for
practically nothing

37:19.859 --> 37:23.029
if they bought lunch in an
Old Time Fun Town red t-shirt.

37:39.179 --> 37:40.413
Whoa, hey, hey!

38:02.869 --> 38:04.237
Get him out, get him out!

38:04.337 --> 38:05.438
You have to get
the head off first!

38:05.538 --> 38:09.409
They touched me, I
mean, they touched me.

38:09.509 --> 38:10.744
Why did they touch me like that?

38:10.844 --> 38:13.313
You're one of the lucky ones.

38:13.413 --> 38:16.883
You could have ended up
like Tommy the Turtle.

38:16.983 --> 38:20.887
Well, what happened
to Tommy the Turtle?

38:20.987 --> 38:23.723
The Red Shirts surrounded Tommy.

38:25.358 --> 38:28.194
He tried to protect himself by
turning his shell toward 'em.

38:28.294 --> 38:32.465
But the Red Shirts pushed him
into the Bumper Boat Pond.

38:33.533 --> 38:36.035
That turtle sank like a stone.

38:37.337 --> 38:38.505
Oh, my gosh.

38:39.439 --> 38:40.774
Was he all right?

38:40.874 --> 38:42.108
Nobody knows.

38:43.276 --> 38:46.046
They dredged the pond,
but all they found

38:46.146 --> 38:49.816
was a few pieces of fun fur
and somebody's rettainer,

38:49.916 --> 38:52.786
but I don't think
that was Tommy's.

38:52.886 --> 38:55.789
But they say he's
still down there.

38:58.258 --> 39:01.061
Um, that Bumper Boat
Pond is more like

39:01.161 --> 39:05.632
a chlorinated pool that's
only two feet deep, so...

39:05.732 --> 39:06.566
Exactly.

39:09.836 --> 39:12.038
Wait, no, that's not
the end of the story,

39:12.138 --> 39:13.573
you guys not care about this?

39:13.673 --> 39:16.409
Wait, there's fun fur, but you
know it doesn't have fun fur,

39:16.509 --> 39:18.912
it can't, because it's a turtle.

39:19.012 --> 39:20.213
Are you okay?

39:20.313 --> 39:21.147
Yeah.

39:22.415 --> 39:23.583
I just feel so violated.

39:23.683 --> 39:25.351
Are you kidding me?

39:25.452 --> 39:27.120
Do you know how many times
I've gotten my boobs grabbed

39:27.220 --> 39:28.521
or my butt pinched?

39:28.621 --> 39:31.591
And that's just at my other job.

39:31.691 --> 39:32.425
Huh?

39:32.525 --> 39:33.893
Look, you're all right.

39:33.993 --> 39:36.696
Those kids aren't even that
bad, so snap out of it.

39:36.796 --> 39:39.265
Ooh, tell you what, you should
come to the Haven House.

39:39.365 --> 39:41.367
It's on Grand Avenue
and Celebration Place.

39:41.468 --> 39:45.872
I bet you'll come away with
a whole new perspective.

39:45.972 --> 39:47.674
Sure, yeah.

39:47.774 --> 39:48.942
I mean, maybe.

39:51.578 --> 39:54.147
Yes.

39:54.247 --> 39:55.415
The Haven House at Artisan Park

39:55.515 --> 39:57.517
was only a few
blocks from my house,

39:57.617 --> 39:59.219
but it took me an
hour to get there,

39:59.319 --> 40:01.888
stopping every three feet
to build up my courage.

40:01.988 --> 40:03.389
I was such a wuss.

40:06.392 --> 40:08.061
Linda, sit down.

40:08.161 --> 40:11.664
No, don't eat that
paste, Daniel, come on.

40:12.999 --> 40:13.833
Tucker!

40:15.235 --> 40:17.237
Oh, my God, I can't believe
you actually showed up.

40:17.337 --> 40:18.171
Wow.

40:19.172 --> 40:19.973
You look...

40:20.073 --> 40:22.008
Oh, blow dried, yeah.

40:22.108 --> 40:24.844
Crazy things happen when you
take a shower.

40:24.944 --> 40:26.813
Uh, am I interrupting or...

40:26.913 --> 40:27.981
No!
I can come back...

40:28.081 --> 40:29.182
No, no, no, no, no, it's good,

40:29.282 --> 40:32.785
we're just doing crafts
right now, come on.

40:36.756 --> 40:38.191
Kids.

40:38.291 --> 40:39.626
Yeah, my kids.

40:52.138 --> 40:53.006
Cute kids.

40:53.106 --> 40:54.908
I know, they're the best.

40:55.008 --> 40:57.777
Here, this is Don and Jenny

40:57.877 --> 40:59.946
and Madame Dorothy.

41:00.046 --> 41:02.348
And how is Your
Majesty doing today?

41:02.448 --> 41:05.552
Absolutely splendid, my dear.

41:05.652 --> 41:07.020
Very good.

41:07.120 --> 41:08.354
This is normal.

41:09.556 --> 41:11.624
And here is Miss Abigail.

41:12.692 --> 41:14.961
Abigail, that's
beautiful, what is that?

41:15.061 --> 41:16.863
I have no fricking idea.

41:16.963 --> 41:20.166
Contemporary art, I
love it, I love it.

41:20.266 --> 41:21.801
Oh, Miss Patty,
this is Miss Patty,

41:21.901 --> 41:23.803
she pretty much runs
the whole place.

41:23.903 --> 41:24.871
Tucker, right?

41:24.971 --> 41:26.806
I've heard a lot about you.

41:26.906 --> 41:28.207
Okay, no more words.

41:28.308 --> 41:30.410
And over here, excuse me.

41:32.679 --> 41:35.915
Daniel, Daniel, don't
eat the paste, please.

41:36.015 --> 41:37.450
Ah, come on, Sam.

41:37.550 --> 41:39.652
I'm old, I'm not stupid.

41:39.752 --> 41:43.923
I'm having a little fun
with Miss Priss over there.

41:44.958 --> 41:46.292
Oh!

41:46.392 --> 41:47.493
Lucinda.

41:47.594 --> 41:50.396
I'm working on getting
her into the sack.

41:50.496 --> 41:52.632
Gals like a guy
that's different.

41:52.732 --> 41:55.868
Well, you certainly
are different, Daniel.

41:55.969 --> 41:58.238
For my next move,

41:58.338 --> 42:00.707
I'm gonna wear my
underwear on the outside.

42:05.111 --> 42:06.846
Who's the dude?

42:06.946 --> 42:08.114
Oh, this is Tucker.

42:08.214 --> 42:11.217
I work with him at
Old Time Fun Town.

42:11.317 --> 42:12.385
Hello.

42:12.485 --> 42:14.320
Outside the pants,
it'll laugh them right...

42:14.420 --> 42:17.690
Okay, thank you,
we're done, all right.

42:22.061 --> 42:24.163
And this is the backyard.

42:27.367 --> 42:28.701
It's not used much.

42:28.801 --> 42:30.770
I wish we could use it more.

42:30.870 --> 42:35.141
All this space and nothing
but a bunch of weeds.

42:35.241 --> 42:36.876
Oh, hey, Lyle.

42:36.976 --> 42:38.978
You're not doing crafts?

42:40.446 --> 42:42.649
Maybe you can join us later
when we do other activities.

42:42.749 --> 42:45.718
Daniel's taking his pants
off in the hall, again.

42:45.818 --> 42:46.653
Okay.

42:54.694 --> 42:55.528
Hi.

43:02.568 --> 43:03.403
Tucker.

43:07.240 --> 43:10.309
I work with Sam at
Old Time Fun Town.

43:12.545 --> 43:14.180
She's a dog.

43:14.280 --> 43:17.116
I mean, she wears
the dog costume.

43:18.484 --> 43:19.719
I'm a kangaroo.

43:22.922 --> 43:24.457
Kangaroo?

43:24.557 --> 43:27.660
Yeah, yeah, I wear
a kangaroo costume.

43:27.760 --> 43:31.164
I was attacked by a
kangaroo two nights ago!

43:31.264 --> 43:34.267
He hopped up to me at
the ATM on 5th Street

43:34.367 --> 43:36.869
and he robbed me of 400 bucks!

43:38.338 --> 43:39.405
Was that you?

43:40.273 --> 43:43.242
Nope, no, no, no, it wasn't.

43:43.342 --> 43:44.911
Beware!

43:45.011 --> 43:48.081
The kangaroo, beware, kangaroo!

43:48.181 --> 43:50.783
Okay, it's okay,
Lyle, it's okay.

43:50.883 --> 43:52.752
Sit down, okay?

43:52.852 --> 43:54.987
Sorry, Lyle was apparently
mugged a few days ago

43:55.088 --> 43:56.823
and it was really
traumatic for him.

43:56.923 --> 43:58.157
The kangaroo.

43:58.257 --> 43:59.625
I know, I know.

43:59.726 --> 44:02.361
He was doing fine, but I
guess something set him off,

44:02.462 --> 44:03.329
I don't know.

44:03.429 --> 44:05.031
Kangaroo!
I know.

44:05.131 --> 44:06.766
Maybe I should go.

44:06.866 --> 44:08.434
Uh, sure, okay.

44:08.534 --> 44:11.938
Um, yeah, you can just go out
the back gate there, okay?

44:12.038 --> 44:13.172
And he punched me.

44:13.272 --> 44:15.041
That's what kangaroos
do, you know.

44:15.141 --> 44:16.008
I know.

44:17.176 --> 44:18.611
Coming through!

44:19.779 --> 44:22.115
And he had a pouch,
just like that!

44:22.215 --> 44:22.982
Daniel!

44:24.016 --> 44:26.085
Okay, settle down, people!

44:27.153 --> 44:27.887
Daniel!

44:43.870 --> 44:45.538
Stop the drumming!

44:46.739 --> 44:48.541
Well, don't quit practicing.

44:48.641 --> 44:52.645
Go parade between that
tree and that tree.

44:52.745 --> 44:53.579
What?

44:54.647 --> 44:57.850
Oh, I just see
something over there.

44:57.950 --> 44:59.852
Like, I get it.

44:59.952 --> 45:02.121
I get it, like, I have boxing
gloves, I'm a kangaroo.

45:02.221 --> 45:03.656
Uh huh, yeah.

45:03.756 --> 45:04.757
Why do you have binoculars?

45:04.857 --> 45:06.459
I'm people-watching, man.

45:06.559 --> 45:07.894
Yeah, but you're a parrot.

45:07.994 --> 45:10.029
Shouldn't you have, like,
that spyglass thing?

45:10.129 --> 45:11.430
Don't overthink it, man.

45:11.531 --> 45:13.533
Don't forget, this
is Old Time Fun Town.

45:13.633 --> 45:16.836
Yeah, but you're a parrot,
you should do that pirate...

45:16.936 --> 45:19.739
Okay, so I juggle these.

45:19.839 --> 45:21.174
But shouldn't they be pink?

45:21.274 --> 45:22.708
They're snowballs, Stu.

45:22.809 --> 45:23.643
Wait, does that go with this?

45:23.743 --> 45:25.878
No, this is my bone baton.

45:25.978 --> 45:29.582
One of your balls is
bigger than the other.

45:32.985 --> 45:35.321
So, can I throw these now?

45:36.189 --> 45:38.357
Not now, tomorrow,

45:38.457 --> 45:43.095
when there are actually people
here to catch them.

45:43.196 --> 45:44.096
Oh, okay.

45:45.364 --> 45:47.934
How about we do like
they do in New Orleans?

45:48.034 --> 45:49.769
I toss them to you
and you lift your...

45:49.869 --> 45:51.537
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

45:51.637 --> 45:54.373
Doesn't Universal's Mardi
Gras parade throw beads?

45:54.474 --> 45:55.808
Isn't that kind of copying?

45:55.908 --> 45:58.044
No, they're not beads, Jerry.

45:58.144 --> 46:00.279
It's a string of
iridescent pearls

46:00.379 --> 46:02.548
from the blue
whale's magic grotto.

46:02.648 --> 46:03.483
Oh.

46:04.684 --> 46:05.518
Okay.

46:06.719 --> 46:07.753
Ready, guys?

46:07.854 --> 46:08.688
Most parades One, two...

46:08.788 --> 46:10.256
Have floats and big balloons

46:10.356 --> 46:12.124
and lots of people and things.

46:12.225 --> 46:15.027
Oh, well, everyone seemed
to be enjoying themselves,

46:15.127 --> 46:17.964
except the drummers who
quit that afternoon,

46:18.064 --> 46:19.465
but the show must go on

46:19.565 --> 46:22.401
because the Fourth
of July was upon us.

46:32.546 --> 46:33.580
All right, now
listen to me, we've

46:34.615 --> 46:35.949
got Channels 6, 9, and 2,

46:36.049 --> 46:37.818
two newspapers and
three radio stations,

46:37.918 --> 46:40.454
as well as nine bloggers
coming in on this bus.

46:40.554 --> 46:43.523
Whatever you do, keep
them away from Donnie.

46:43.624 --> 46:44.925
Don't let them
interview him, okay?

46:45.025 --> 46:46.426
He's a loose cannon.

46:46.526 --> 46:48.195
Not even he knows what kind
of inappropriate offensiveness

46:48.295 --> 46:50.497
might come out of his mouth.

46:50.597 --> 46:51.331
Do you got it?

46:51.431 --> 46:52.599
Got it, boss.

46:52.699 --> 46:54.902
All right, good, go
get 'em, go get 'em!

46:55.002 --> 46:56.303
Be safe out there.

47:23.230 --> 47:24.631
When do we go on?

47:24.731 --> 47:26.633
Like they said, not until
the press walks the park

47:26.733 --> 47:29.503
and gets positioned in the VIP
section of the parade round.

47:29.603 --> 47:31.104
Sam will get the call from ops.

47:31.204 --> 47:33.273
How did I get
elected to do this?

47:33.373 --> 47:35.776
Bravo, Tango, Harry, we
have an anxious Hoppy

47:35.876 --> 47:38.278
ready to strut his stuff, over.

47:38.378 --> 47:40.781
Parade characters, do you read?

47:40.881 --> 47:43.750
Loud and clear, over.

47:43.850 --> 47:46.053
Press is at the front gate right now.

47:46.153 --> 47:49.423
ETA for the parade, 20 minutes.

47:49.523 --> 47:52.159
10-4, uh, good buddy.

47:59.466 --> 48:00.467
Is that...

48:02.035 --> 48:02.869
No.

48:04.338 --> 48:07.007
It is a beautiful day and it
looks like Old Time Fun Town

48:07.107 --> 48:10.310
is a good old
place to go to town

48:10.410 --> 48:12.512
and have a fun time this summer.

48:14.247 --> 48:15.449
Excuse me, sir.

48:15.549 --> 48:18.285
Hi, I'm Josh Earnest with PSTV,

48:18.385 --> 48:20.487
Pre-School Television.

48:20.587 --> 48:21.421
Cable 27?

48:22.422 --> 48:24.458
You are with the park?

48:24.558 --> 48:26.994
Yes, I'm a designer here.

48:27.094 --> 48:29.629
Make sure you stay
inside the line, Joe.

48:29.730 --> 48:32.833
Well, it certainly
is a whimsical display.

48:32.933 --> 48:35.135
Yeah, it's for the
kids, it's a kid theme,

48:35.235 --> 48:39.139
with a whale and a dog and
a rainbow there, you know.

48:39.239 --> 48:43.310
Well, the rainbow is very
nice, and I see a rabbit...

48:43.410 --> 48:44.578
Kangaroo!

48:44.678 --> 48:46.346
And a kangaroo,

48:46.446 --> 48:47.681
and, look kids,

48:48.582 --> 48:50.817
a piratical parrot!

48:50.917 --> 48:52.819
And while I've got you here,

48:52.919 --> 48:55.188
why is the polar bear pink?

48:56.423 --> 48:57.958
Hell, what do I know?

48:58.058 --> 49:00.927
Maybe because it's a
freaking drag queen...

49:01.028 --> 49:01.862
No!

49:11.738 --> 49:12.806
Did I hear "drag queen"?

49:12.906 --> 49:13.807
Is that drag queen?

49:13.907 --> 49:14.875
Someone get him out of here!

49:14.975 --> 49:15.642
Someone get him...

49:15.742 --> 49:17.277
I sense a slight delay.

49:17.377 --> 49:18.779
That interview ended up getting

49:18.879 --> 49:21.915
about a million hits, and
for the next couple of days,

49:22.015 --> 49:24.651
attendance actually picked up.

49:24.751 --> 49:27.687
I guess there is no
such thing as bad PR.

49:27.788 --> 49:30.891
It was during that delay I
thought I'd grow a pair and

49:30.991 --> 49:35.162
strike up a conversation with
Franklin Jefferson Washington.

49:36.530 --> 49:38.732
Uh, Mr. Washington,
can I ask you a question?

49:38.832 --> 49:39.533
No.

49:39.633 --> 49:40.767
Okay.

49:40.867 --> 49:42.969
Not until you call
me by my first name.

49:43.070 --> 49:44.538
Man, who do you think I am?

49:44.638 --> 49:47.174
I'm wearing a bright blue
fuzzy-wuzzy whale costume.

49:47.274 --> 49:48.942
Call me Frank.

49:49.042 --> 49:50.010
Okay, Frank.

49:50.110 --> 49:52.279
And I'll call you Pooter.

49:52.379 --> 49:53.613
I'm just messing with you, man,

49:53.713 --> 49:56.283
I heard that was your
nickname in high school.

49:56.383 --> 49:57.350
Tucker, right?

49:57.451 --> 49:58.718
Yeah, yeah.

49:58.819 --> 49:59.553
What's your question?

49:59.653 --> 50:00.487
Give it to me.

50:00.587 --> 50:01.855
Uh, okay, um,

50:03.056 --> 50:06.426
you're really good,
I mean, really good.

50:06.526 --> 50:09.596
Yeah, I know.

50:09.696 --> 50:11.965
I just, I wanna be better.

50:12.065 --> 50:14.401
You know, I think
I need advice on...

50:14.501 --> 50:16.603
Don't work for
your costume, man.

50:16.703 --> 50:19.973
Make your costume work for you.

50:20.073 --> 50:22.142
Don't work for
your costume, man.

50:22.242 --> 50:24.845
Make your costume work for you.

50:26.446 --> 50:27.280
Yeah.

50:28.982 --> 50:31.418
I have no idea
what you're saying.

50:31.518 --> 50:34.121
Modify your character.

50:34.221 --> 50:37.023
Oh, you mean like, make
Hoppy a different type...

50:37.124 --> 50:38.692
No, man.

50:38.792 --> 50:40.293
Modify it.

50:40.393 --> 50:41.461
Look in here.

50:43.497 --> 50:44.431
Look inside

50:45.532 --> 50:46.900
and see the magic.

50:49.402 --> 50:51.705
It was amazing!

50:51.805 --> 50:54.107
All the tricks,
right in front of me.

50:54.207 --> 50:56.543
How did he stay so energetic?

50:56.643 --> 50:58.478
Headphones with music.

51:00.313 --> 51:03.016
If he needed a
snack, a food holder,

51:03.116 --> 51:06.786
jelly beans, peanuts,
even chicken teriyaki.

51:08.989 --> 51:10.123
And with this costume,

51:10.223 --> 51:12.726
hands-free was what
it was all about.

51:12.826 --> 51:14.594
Hey, there, little fella.

51:14.694 --> 51:15.595
Having a good day?

51:15.695 --> 51:16.696
I know I am.

51:17.998 --> 51:20.367
Watch a game or
text a friend, done.

51:20.467 --> 51:22.068
Even a fan at the
top of the head

51:22.169 --> 51:24.137
sucked hot air out
of the costume.

51:24.237 --> 51:28.775
And, an ashtray for one of
those foot longs he smoked.

51:28.875 --> 51:33.580
Now, I thought to myself,
he wouldn't, he couldn't.

51:36.616 --> 51:37.984
We're on in five minutes.

51:38.084 --> 51:40.487
Let's get to our starting
points and suit up, everybody!

52:01.107 --> 52:02.542
Let's do this.

52:25.765 --> 52:29.536
That's the shortest
parade we've ever seen.

52:30.837 --> 52:32.405
What is that smell?

52:33.573 --> 52:36.643
Is that smoke coming
out of the whale?

52:39.479 --> 52:42.749
Fire!
That thing's on fire!

52:42.849 --> 52:44.751
Call the fire department!

52:44.851 --> 52:47.554
It's burning, that's on fire!

52:47.654 --> 52:50.323
Wait, that's not a gas can!

53:02.802 --> 53:06.206
Goodnight, Sir
Lyle, sweet dreams.

53:06.306 --> 53:08.408
Goodnight, Sam, coming in?

53:08.508 --> 53:09.409
In a bit.

53:14.214 --> 53:15.048
Ka-kaw!

53:16.449 --> 53:17.250
Ka-kaw!

53:19.552 --> 53:22.756
The coast is clear, you
big chicken, Lyle's inside.

53:22.856 --> 53:23.957
Oh, I mean,

53:25.592 --> 53:28.194
I can do a big chicken
if you want me to.

53:28.295 --> 53:29.829
Go for it.

53:31.431 --> 53:34.668
That did not
sound like a big chicken.

53:34.768 --> 53:36.036
Did you bring the stuff?

53:36.136 --> 53:37.037
Uh, yeah.

53:38.471 --> 53:39.973
Ooh, you da man.

53:43.043 --> 53:45.712
I'm ready for the show.

53:45.812 --> 53:47.347
Oh, yeah,

53:47.447 --> 53:49.549
right, right, right.

53:49.649 --> 53:50.483
Uh...

53:51.484 --> 53:52.218
All right.

53:52.319 --> 53:53.053
Okay.

53:53.153 --> 53:54.054
You ready?

53:54.154 --> 53:54.988
Uh huh.

53:55.088 --> 53:55.922
So this is the first.

53:56.022 --> 53:57.490
Okay.

53:57.590 --> 53:58.591
Oh, so cool!

54:02.662 --> 54:04.965
All right, and this
is the second one I did.

54:05.065 --> 54:06.132
This is, like, me at work.

54:06.232 --> 54:07.801
Uh huh, of course.

54:07.901 --> 54:09.336
Yes!
And little Jerry.

54:09.436 --> 54:10.437
That's Jerry?
Yeah!

54:10.537 --> 54:12.906
He's so tiny!

54:13.006 --> 54:14.074
And that's me!

54:14.174 --> 54:15.375
Are you serious?

54:15.475 --> 54:18.545
Oh, my God!

54:19.713 --> 54:21.314
That is so cool, you did that?

54:21.414 --> 54:22.182
Yeah.

54:22.282 --> 54:23.583
That is so cool.

54:23.683 --> 54:24.517
Thanks.

54:25.919 --> 54:28.722
I tell you what, if I ever
stop being a sweaty character,

54:28.822 --> 54:30.390
I would be a fat girl.

54:30.490 --> 54:31.424
Oh, yeah.

54:33.159 --> 54:36.196
I mean, like, not, oh, no,
no, I didn't mean it like...

54:36.296 --> 54:38.898
It's okay.

54:38.998 --> 54:40.066
Big day today.

54:40.166 --> 54:44.237
Did Franklin get...

54:44.337 --> 54:47.040
No, no, you know what?

54:47.140 --> 54:50.143
He claimed what he was
smoking was for medical use.

54:50.243 --> 54:51.544
I know, when they
tried to find him,

54:51.644 --> 54:53.847
he already snuck out the back.

54:53.947 --> 54:55.181
You know, I was like this close

54:55.281 --> 54:56.449
to being his best friend, too.

54:56.549 --> 54:59.619
Oh, yeah, like so close.

54:59.719 --> 55:02.856
Well, you still have
Stu and Jerry and me,

55:02.956 --> 55:05.258
at least for a little while.

55:06.359 --> 55:08.461
What, you're leaving?

55:08.561 --> 55:09.829
I think so.

55:09.929 --> 55:13.700
Gerontological nurse
practitioner program.

55:13.800 --> 55:15.168
Old people nurse.

55:15.268 --> 55:18.171
I'm supposed to hear back
from them anytime now,

55:18.271 --> 55:21.341
and I fly out and get a campus
tour and if it looks good,

55:21.441 --> 55:24.844
then I would start
right after Labor Day.

55:25.712 --> 55:26.546
Wow.

55:27.680 --> 55:28.681
Yeah.

55:28.782 --> 55:29.716
It's a really cool place.

55:29.816 --> 55:31.284
It's in LA.

55:31.384 --> 55:33.086
Oh, really, I'm going to LA!

55:33.186 --> 55:33.920
Really?

55:34.020 --> 55:35.855
No, no, no, I'm not.

55:37.290 --> 55:39.959
Once I factor in all this
scholarship money that I won

55:40.059 --> 55:43.530
and what I've saved, I'll
be, you know, I don't know,

55:43.630 --> 55:47.000
a million dollars away
from making my tuition.

55:47.100 --> 55:48.435
What is it that you want to do?

55:48.535 --> 55:50.303
A girl that wanted to listen to me

55:50.403 --> 55:52.705
blab on about what I
wanted to do with my life

55:52.806 --> 55:55.975
and actually showed
interest and enthusiasm?

55:56.075 --> 55:57.510
I was in.

55:57.610 --> 56:02.282
So I gave it to her, my love
of art, design, comic books.

56:02.382 --> 56:03.550
I almost lost her at comic books

56:04.884 --> 56:06.019
but I got her back
with theme parks

56:06.119 --> 56:08.922
and master planning and
rides and attractions

56:09.022 --> 56:10.490
and the theme park greats,

56:10.590 --> 56:12.992
Walt, George, Gary,

56:13.092 --> 56:14.894
the true unsung heroes,

56:14.994 --> 56:16.463
about how I'm
going to bring back

56:16.563 --> 56:19.966
the classics, the Steeple
Chase, the Helter Skelter,

56:20.066 --> 56:21.367
the Tunnel of Love.

56:21.468 --> 56:22.502
You know what I want?

56:22.602 --> 56:23.870
What?

56:23.970 --> 56:25.605
You know what I want?

56:25.705 --> 56:27.507
No, what do you want?

56:27.607 --> 56:31.911
I want all of my kids
in there to feel this.

56:32.011 --> 56:35.582
This, this, they
need to feel this.

56:35.682 --> 56:37.383
They can't go to theme parks.

56:37.484 --> 56:39.486
They can't go to Coney Island.

56:39.586 --> 56:43.523
They are stuck here and
that's why they're here.

56:43.623 --> 56:46.493
They can't travel anymore,
they can't live anymore.

56:46.593 --> 56:50.029
I mean, all they have is this
house, a cruddy backyard,

56:50.129 --> 56:51.898
and a few people like me.

56:51.998 --> 56:54.501
And the TV, of
course, thank God,

56:54.601 --> 56:57.871
or the boob tube, as Daniel
calls it, Mr. Underwear.

56:59.572 --> 57:02.308
I'm so worried about him.

57:02.408 --> 57:04.711
He's refused dialysis.

57:04.811 --> 57:07.313
He hates it, he's so stubborn.

57:08.715 --> 57:09.549
Anyway.

57:12.785 --> 57:14.287
They need to feel.

57:16.456 --> 57:18.591
They need to experience
true joy and wonder

57:18.691 --> 57:20.894
one more time before they go.

57:20.994 --> 57:25.098
So, come up with a
theme park for seniors

57:25.198 --> 57:28.468
and I'll declare you
one of the greats.

57:34.440 --> 57:36.342
Ready, set, go, baby, go!

57:52.425 --> 57:56.162
Those landscapers
always have a good time.

57:56.262 --> 57:57.564
They're just happy.

57:57.664 --> 58:00.700
Yeah, man, they enjoy life.

58:00.800 --> 58:04.070
Yeah, but not everyone
experiences this,

58:04.170 --> 58:05.405
you know, this.

58:09.409 --> 58:11.411
How could everyone
be that giddy?

58:11.511 --> 58:12.745
You okay, dude?

58:12.845 --> 58:13.913
You're talking like a girl.

58:14.013 --> 58:15.682
Yeah, man.

58:15.782 --> 58:17.150
I gotta talk to Sam
when she gets in.

58:17.250 --> 58:19.752
Yo, you gotta wait
a week for that.

58:19.852 --> 58:22.288
Yeah, man, she's off
to California this week

58:22.388 --> 58:24.424
to visit the facility
and find an apartment

58:24.524 --> 58:26.192
and, you know, what?

58:27.260 --> 58:29.262
Wow, she got the call.

58:30.196 --> 58:31.297
Don't worry, Tucker,

58:31.397 --> 58:32.532
your girlfriend's
coming back next week.

58:32.632 --> 58:33.900
She's not my girlfriend.

58:34.000 --> 58:35.435
And I have a very
important cosplay convention

58:35.535 --> 58:38.104
to attend this weekend, so
you have to cover for me.

58:38.204 --> 58:39.172
What?

58:39.272 --> 58:40.106
Yeah, I'm going as Aang, so...

58:40.206 --> 58:41.274
Aang?

58:41.374 --> 58:43.009
It's from Avatar, Jerry.

58:43.109 --> 58:45.912
Oh, I love that movie,
man, with the blue people!

58:46.012 --> 58:48.948
No, not, it's a different...

58:49.048 --> 58:50.783
Wait, aren't you going
to have to shave your head?

58:50.883 --> 58:53.253
No, I can do, like, effects
and stuff, it'll be fine.

58:53.353 --> 58:54.754
Well, yeah, man, you
gotta cover for Stu

58:54.854 --> 58:57.657
because we've been booked for
an off-site event tonight.

58:57.757 --> 59:00.026
Yeah.

59:00.126 --> 59:02.629
It's at a private party at
a residence in Winter Park,

59:02.729 --> 59:03.963
and they specifically requested

59:04.063 --> 59:07.433
"the toucan and
the hot pink bear."

59:07.533 --> 59:09.102
Oh, house party, woot, woot!

59:09.202 --> 59:10.036
Thanks for covering for me.

59:11.070 --> 59:11.904
Wearing Stu's costume

59:12.005 --> 59:13.640
without any time to clean it?

59:13.740 --> 59:15.975
We didn't call him
Sweaty Stu for nothing.

59:16.075 --> 59:18.244
We constantly had fans going,

59:18.344 --> 59:21.681
trying to air out the
costumes, but Stu?

59:22.582 --> 59:25.451
He's part man, part fountain.

59:25.551 --> 59:28.888
What Pig Pen is to
dirt, Stu was to sweat,

59:28.988 --> 59:31.891
and strangely proud of it.

59:31.991 --> 59:34.160
It's hot out there, man.

59:36.295 --> 59:38.965
Once a week, we
tear apart each costume,

59:39.065 --> 59:42.268
wash the skin, take
the padding outside

59:42.368 --> 59:43.970
and pressure wash
the crap out of it.

59:44.070 --> 59:46.172
Not me, man, spray the suit!

59:46.272 --> 59:48.508
Then we crop
dust it with disinfectant

59:48.608 --> 59:52.578
and air purifiers and
still, Stu's big pink bear

59:52.679 --> 59:55.114
smelled as ripe as if he
just stepped out of it.

59:56.949 --> 59:59.952
Yo, and this one doesn't
even start till nine tonight.

01:00:00.053 --> 01:00:02.021
Just take the costumes
and dress in the van.

01:00:06.159 --> 01:00:09.028
George, oh man,
he won again, oh.

01:00:29.917 --> 01:00:31.852
Yo, come on, man,
this is an easy gig.

01:00:31.952 --> 01:00:33.554
We just stand outside the
house on the lawn here

01:00:33.654 --> 01:00:35.923
and welcome people
as they come in.

01:00:36.023 --> 01:00:37.324
Is it a birthday party?

01:00:37.424 --> 01:00:39.460
No, it's like a
costume party, I guess.

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:42.329
So let's get suited up, come on!

01:00:42.429 --> 01:00:43.764
It's like a pink nightmare.

01:00:43.864 --> 01:00:46.500
Yo, Tuck, I did it once
and it's not that bad.

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:48.035
You just have to go for it.

01:00:48.135 --> 01:00:49.970
Just jump into it fast and
let your sweat take over,

01:00:50.070 --> 01:00:51.105
become one with it.

01:00:51.205 --> 01:00:52.106
No.

01:00:52.206 --> 01:00:53.173
You can do it.
No.

01:00:53.273 --> 01:00:53.941
Come on, man.

01:00:54.041 --> 01:00:55.743
He's so gross.

01:00:55.843 --> 01:00:57.678
Dude, suit up!

01:00:57.778 --> 01:01:00.280
Okay, okay, I'm gonna do it.

01:01:01.415 --> 01:01:03.717
I'm gonna do it,
I'm gonna do it.

01:01:03.817 --> 01:01:06.587
Cold and clammy,

01:01:06.687 --> 01:01:08.021
cold and clammy.

01:01:08.922 --> 01:01:10.791
That's another sensory sensation

01:01:10.891 --> 01:01:13.727
that will stay with me
the rest of my life.

01:01:17.831 --> 01:01:19.199
Hey, ladies.

01:01:19.299 --> 01:01:22.236
Gonna go party
with the Fire Lord.

01:01:22.336 --> 01:01:23.670
Care to join me?

01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:38.585
Oh, my, you look fabulous!

01:01:40.053 --> 01:01:41.622
Oh, and right on time, too!

01:01:41.722 --> 01:01:45.025
Oh, come close so I can tell
you what you have to do.

01:01:45.125 --> 01:01:47.261
It's quite simple, really.

01:01:47.361 --> 01:01:50.664
All you have to do is stand
at the edge of the walkway

01:01:50.764 --> 01:01:53.100
and greet our lovely guests.

01:01:54.168 --> 01:01:57.104
Oh, you don't talk, charming.

01:01:57.204 --> 01:02:00.073
There are about 50
of my friends coming.

01:02:00.174 --> 01:02:03.076
Once everyone has arrived,

01:02:03.177 --> 01:02:06.580
you are more than welcome
to join the party.

01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:07.514
Yeah?

01:02:08.882 --> 01:02:11.451
Oh, here they come, TTFN, TTFN!

01:02:13.787 --> 01:02:14.621
Oh, dear.

01:02:17.825 --> 01:02:18.659
TTFN?

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:21.962
That means ta-ta for now.

01:02:22.062 --> 01:02:22.963
First, how did you know that?

01:02:24.298 --> 01:02:26.533
Second, what have
you got me into?

01:02:26.633 --> 01:02:28.869
Here they come.

01:02:28.969 --> 01:02:30.771
The costume was
starting to warm up,

01:02:30.871 --> 01:02:32.272
which helped a lot,

01:02:32.372 --> 01:02:35.275
and I was soon distracted
by the arriving guests.

01:02:35.375 --> 01:02:37.644
Oh, look at this,
looks like a pink bear.

01:02:37.744 --> 01:02:38.478
Meow!

01:02:50.090 --> 01:02:51.325
Don't you see that?

01:02:51.425 --> 01:02:53.393
They've got better
costumes than we do.

01:02:53.494 --> 01:02:55.662
Man, I'm picturing Sam
underneath that leather!

01:02:55.762 --> 01:02:56.997
Shut up.

01:02:57.097 --> 01:02:59.533
We know you got a
thing for her, man.

01:02:59.633 --> 01:03:01.034
Yo, check it out!

01:03:02.903 --> 01:03:05.205
Ooh, pink bear, so cute.

01:03:05.305 --> 01:03:07.841
You coming into the party?

01:03:07.941 --> 01:03:10.844
Aw, come on, I'll
see you in there.

01:03:13.814 --> 01:03:14.548
You see that?

01:03:14.648 --> 01:03:15.482
What?

01:03:15.582 --> 01:03:16.984
She pinched my bird butt.

01:03:17.084 --> 01:03:20.654
I know, I think they want
us to join the, oh, my God.

01:03:21.688 --> 01:03:23.690
Stu, it's me, Bear Man.

01:03:23.790 --> 01:03:25.926
Give it up for Bear Man!

01:03:26.026 --> 01:03:27.127
Tucker.

01:03:27.227 --> 01:03:28.061
Tucker?

01:03:28.161 --> 01:03:29.830
It's me, Jose, from landscaping.

01:03:29.930 --> 01:03:31.298
I didn't know you
were into this.

01:03:31.398 --> 01:03:32.266
Jose!

01:03:32.366 --> 01:03:34.201
Oh, you're here!

01:03:34.301 --> 01:03:35.903
Now the party can
officially begin.

01:03:36.003 --> 01:03:37.571
Party time.

01:03:37.671 --> 01:03:39.873
Come on, Jose!

01:03:39.973 --> 01:03:41.308
I'm out.

01:03:41.408 --> 01:03:44.978
Yo, no, no, no, no, chill,
chill, man, stay here, come on.

01:03:46.413 --> 01:03:47.247
Oh, sh!

01:03:55.489 --> 01:03:58.492
It was starting to
get interesting.

01:03:58.592 --> 01:04:00.494
We were quite a hit.

01:04:00.594 --> 01:04:02.663
Dude, I think this
is a furry party.

01:04:02.763 --> 01:04:03.997
Oh, you think?

01:04:04.097 --> 01:04:06.166
Yeah, I hear these
get-togethers get pretty wild.

01:04:07.167 --> 01:04:08.302
You need to get out more

01:04:08.402 --> 01:04:09.536
because that gives
furries a bad name.

01:04:09.636 --> 01:04:11.705
I suppose you're right.

01:04:12.839 --> 01:04:15.208
Yo, I think our
shift's almost over.

01:04:15.309 --> 01:04:16.143
Incoming!

01:04:20.447 --> 01:04:21.448
Hi, honey.

01:04:29.523 --> 01:04:31.224
Perhaps just a peek around back.

01:04:31.325 --> 01:04:33.527
I mean, we were invited.

01:04:33.627 --> 01:04:35.295
Yeah, to the pool!

01:04:42.169 --> 01:04:43.971
I can't see with
these lights in my face.

01:04:44.071 --> 01:04:45.639
Then we gotta lift
up our heads, man.

01:04:45.739 --> 01:04:46.473
I can't do it.

01:04:46.573 --> 01:04:47.674
Just do it.

01:04:53.313 --> 01:04:55.415
And the winner, with
the best plushie,

01:04:55.515 --> 01:04:56.984
is Dante!

01:04:58.952 --> 01:05:01.688
Good job, it even
looks just like you.

01:05:01.788 --> 01:05:05.325
Now, who's ready for a great
game of Cards Against Humanity?

01:05:10.998 --> 01:05:13.000
Not what I expected.

01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:14.034
Oh, boys.

01:05:15.469 --> 01:05:18.772
Those furballs don't know
how to have a good time.

01:05:18.872 --> 01:05:19.973
Come next door.

01:05:20.073 --> 01:05:22.175
Things are in full swing.

01:05:23.477 --> 01:05:26.179
I'd never seen
real swingers before.

01:05:26.279 --> 01:05:27.881
Now I'll never be
able to un-see them.

01:05:27.981 --> 01:05:30.784
Yo, you don't see
that every day.

01:05:30.884 --> 01:05:33.553
Jerry, one of those ladies
works at the grocery store

01:05:33.653 --> 01:05:34.855
in the produce section.

01:05:34.955 --> 01:05:35.856
You know...

01:05:35.956 --> 01:05:37.491
No zucchini jokes, please.

01:05:42.195 --> 01:05:44.064
A balmy 82 degrees.

01:05:44.164 --> 01:05:47.934
Top of the news hour, with
your local WPAX report.

01:05:48.035 --> 01:05:50.637
Earlier this evening, the
sixth in a string of robberies

01:05:50.737 --> 01:05:53.040
appears to be the most
brazen as thieves have gone

01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:56.343
from targeting ATMs, joggers,
and convenience stores

01:05:56.443 --> 01:05:58.078
to their first bank heist.

01:05:58.178 --> 01:05:59.880
Yo, they're talking...

01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:02.449
Feeling that
releasing any information

01:06:02.549 --> 01:06:04.584
may cause copycat robberies.

01:06:04.684 --> 01:06:06.920
We'll be right back
after this message

01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:09.523
from the new Old Time Fun Town.

01:06:11.425 --> 01:06:13.360
♪ You're sure to
have a happy day

01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:15.662
♪ At Old Time Fun Town

01:06:15.762 --> 01:06:18.031
♪ So many things to see and do

01:06:19.466 --> 01:06:21.868
♪ It's humongous
It's humongous!

01:06:23.904 --> 01:06:25.238
It's so small.

01:06:41.354 --> 01:06:42.956
Even with Sam gone for a week

01:06:43.056 --> 01:06:44.858
and Stu at a cosplay convention,

01:06:44.958 --> 01:06:49.362
I managed to talk Mr. Lloyd
into giving me a day off.

01:06:49.463 --> 01:06:50.597
And yep,

01:06:50.697 --> 01:06:51.665
Fletcher's parade
was pretty much

01:06:51.765 --> 01:06:54.367
a parrot, some t-shirt girls,

01:06:54.468 --> 01:06:57.137
whichever stilt-walker
showed up,

01:06:57.237 --> 01:06:58.905
and a stuffed whale.

01:06:59.005 --> 01:07:01.108
This is as bad as that
Scare Zone thing they did

01:07:01.208 --> 01:07:02.242
on Halloween.

01:07:02.342 --> 01:07:03.910
Worse.

01:07:10.117 --> 01:07:12.519
Oh, oh, my God.

01:07:22.696 --> 01:07:23.597
But I wasn't gonna let

01:07:23.697 --> 01:07:24.865
the guilt distract me.

01:07:24.965 --> 01:07:27.300
Nope, I had a more
important mission,

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:31.571
even if it was going to set me
back a couple hundred bucks.

01:07:35.142 --> 01:07:36.076
Hey, Mom?

01:07:37.144 --> 01:07:39.546
Where's the electric
screwdriver?

01:07:39.646 --> 01:07:42.449
We sold it, honey!

01:07:42.549 --> 01:07:44.518
The circular saw?

01:07:44.618 --> 01:07:47.154
Sold that, too.

01:07:47.254 --> 01:07:48.355
The drill?

01:07:48.455 --> 01:07:49.923
Sold it.

01:07:50.023 --> 01:07:52.726
Like I said, I had a mission,

01:07:52.826 --> 01:07:56.496
even if it was going to set
me back another 370 bucks.

01:07:56.596 --> 01:07:58.064
Meanwhile in the park...

01:07:58.165 --> 01:08:00.233
Empty your pockets.

01:08:00.333 --> 01:08:03.103
Not those pockets,
your jacket pockets.

01:08:03.203 --> 01:08:05.138
Oh, you got something
to say, punk?

01:08:05.238 --> 01:08:07.340
Then empty those pockets.

01:08:08.742 --> 01:08:11.344
You're not even supposed
to bring food in this park.

01:08:11.444 --> 01:08:14.948
You have to eat our food,
next pocket, now, come on.

01:08:15.048 --> 01:08:18.385
Oh, a dart from the
balloon buster game.

01:08:20.153 --> 01:08:21.921
You like stealing
our property, kid?

01:08:22.022 --> 01:08:23.857
Yeah, you do, in fact,

01:08:24.791 --> 01:08:26.026
hold still.

01:08:26.126 --> 01:08:28.261
Hold perfectly still.

01:08:28.361 --> 01:08:30.296
You like stealing our stuff.

01:08:30.397 --> 01:08:32.098
You like stealing
from our games.

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:34.868
I've got a little game for you.

01:08:34.968 --> 01:08:36.937
It's called Dart to the Brain.

01:08:42.908 --> 01:08:44.611
Ah, let's get out of here.

01:08:46.246 --> 01:08:48.314
Give me the broom, just...

01:08:49.683 --> 01:08:51.117
With summer in full swing,

01:08:51.218 --> 01:08:53.353
Fletcher had his marketing
plan in high gear,

01:08:53.453 --> 01:08:55.322
and we were a big part of it.

01:08:55.421 --> 01:08:58.091
We got to take one of his
convertibles out to the highway,

01:08:58.191 --> 01:09:00.093
where we teamed up with
a highly aggressive

01:09:00.193 --> 01:09:04.029
and super-motivated sales
rep to do anything possible

01:09:04.130 --> 01:09:05.866
to bring in business.

01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:09.970
That dreaded 6:00 to 8:00
morning drive time shift

01:09:10.069 --> 01:09:12.872
was grueling, at least
for the character.

01:09:22.381 --> 01:09:24.718
Between parades, each
character had to promote

01:09:24.818 --> 01:09:27.921
the sales of his or
her animal character.

01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:29.456
Fletcher had the bright idea

01:09:29.555 --> 01:09:33.158
that Hoppy could have a baby
Hoppy come out of its pouch,

01:09:35.795 --> 01:09:37.529
that that would somehow appeal

01:09:37.631 --> 01:09:41.234
to a potential female
buyer's motherly instinct.

01:09:41.334 --> 01:09:44.004
That idea looked
better on paper.

01:09:44.104 --> 01:09:47.006
And in the evenings, I would
crank up my man, Justin Hayward

01:09:50.076 --> 01:09:51.411
and hammer away.

01:09:56.783 --> 01:09:57.617
Mom!

01:10:09.162 --> 01:10:10.530
Excuse me.

01:10:10.630 --> 01:10:11.398
Oh, okay.

01:10:13.466 --> 01:10:15.001
What, dude, did you
party last night?

01:10:15.101 --> 01:10:18.271
No, I pulled an all-nighter
trying to finish this project

01:10:18.371 --> 01:10:19.806
with nothing but hand tools

01:10:19.906 --> 01:10:22.542
and my car headlights
to see what I was doing.

01:10:22.642 --> 01:10:24.277
Oh!
Yeah!

01:10:24.377 --> 01:10:26.313
Now I gotta move all this
stuff, I have to set it up,

01:10:26.413 --> 01:10:28.248
I mean, there's no way.

01:10:28.348 --> 01:10:31.952
Well, what project
are you talking about?

01:10:34.921 --> 01:10:37.057
Whoa, did you design this?

01:10:37.157 --> 01:10:37.991
Yup.

01:10:38.992 --> 01:10:40.427
But, I mean, I'll never
get it done in time.

01:10:40.527 --> 01:10:41.594
I don't know what
I was thinking,

01:10:41.695 --> 01:10:43.396
I mean, it's just
not going to happen.

01:10:43.496 --> 01:10:45.732
Yo, what are friends for?

01:10:45.832 --> 01:10:47.000
You'll help me?

01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:50.170
No, but this looks like
it takes place outdoors.

01:10:50.270 --> 01:10:51.471
Yeah.

01:10:51.571 --> 01:10:53.306
Well, you need to
call on the pros.

01:10:53.406 --> 01:10:54.874
It's time you meet the crew.

01:11:36.716 --> 01:11:39.085
Yeah, my little
project needed much more

01:11:39.185 --> 01:11:41.421
than I could build to fill
up hundreds of square feet

01:11:41.521 --> 01:11:45.058
of grass, weeds,
and cement driveway,

01:11:45.158 --> 01:11:47.794
but the landscapers
had a great idea:

01:11:47.894 --> 01:11:49.262
We could borrow some stuff

01:11:49.362 --> 01:11:51.464
that hadn't been
used for decades.

01:11:51.564 --> 01:11:52.966
Surely that was okay.

01:11:53.066 --> 01:11:54.901
Wait, Jerry, it's okay, right?

01:11:55.001 --> 01:11:56.569
Yeah, man, it's not
like we're stealing.

01:11:56.669 --> 01:11:59.706
We're just putting this
junk to good use.

01:11:59.806 --> 01:12:02.442
I mean, they have
everything except, uh...

01:12:08.047 --> 01:12:10.550
Oh, well, now I guess
they got that, too.

01:12:10.650 --> 01:12:11.484
Okay.

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:16.923
Man, so much stuff
everywhere, gosh.

01:12:20.293 --> 01:12:22.395
Whoa, the original Hoppy?

01:12:24.297 --> 01:12:25.398
No way.

01:12:25.498 --> 01:12:27.333
Check it out, man,
there's a spare bear.

01:12:27.434 --> 01:12:29.269
Huh, you mean I
didn't have to climb

01:12:29.369 --> 01:12:31.037
into Sweaty Stu's
disgusting bear?

01:12:31.137 --> 01:12:33.273
I guess these are
backups just in case.

01:12:33.373 --> 01:12:35.341
Oh, yo, look at that!

01:12:35.442 --> 01:12:38.445
Awesome, yeah,
yeah, that'll work.

01:12:38.545 --> 01:12:39.712
I'll take that, what is this?

01:12:39.813 --> 01:12:41.815
Let's see this, ooh,
I love these things,

01:12:41.915 --> 01:12:45.051
these are great, take all
that, perfect, thank you.

01:12:45.151 --> 01:12:47.053
Uh, hey, the ice cream?

01:12:48.254 --> 01:12:51.624
Bring this, uh, this
can go, that can go.

01:12:51.724 --> 01:12:53.493
What is this?

01:12:53.593 --> 01:12:54.427
No way!

01:12:55.595 --> 01:12:57.030
What?

01:12:57.130 --> 01:12:57.964
Yes!

01:12:58.064 --> 01:13:00.667
Dude, so cool, that's so cool!

01:13:01.734 --> 01:13:02.802
We gotta bring this.

01:13:25.558 --> 01:13:27.660
Hey, Sam.

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:28.495
Goodnight, Sam.

01:13:28.595 --> 01:13:30.063
Hi, bye.

01:13:30.163 --> 01:13:31.064
What's going on here?

01:13:31.164 --> 01:13:32.532
You've gotta check on Daniel.

01:13:38.271 --> 01:13:41.574
It's been five days
since his last dialysis,

01:13:41.674 --> 01:13:43.376
and it's shutting down.

01:13:43.476 --> 01:13:47.013
It hasn't effected his
bad attitude, though.

01:13:47.113 --> 01:13:49.148
Daniel, why are you doing this?

01:13:49.249 --> 01:13:51.651
I'm just trying
to go peacefully.

01:13:51.751 --> 01:13:53.653
There's this dang-blasted
racket going on

01:13:53.753 --> 01:13:57.056
in the backyard, all
dang-blasted day.

01:13:57.157 --> 01:14:01.327
I think you guys need to
come outside and see this.

01:14:09.536 --> 01:14:10.937
Tucker?

01:14:11.037 --> 01:14:13.673
I should have known you had
something to do with this!

01:14:13.773 --> 01:14:15.642
Oh, pipe down, old man.

01:14:15.742 --> 01:14:19.479
The kid's got
something to show you.

01:14:19.579 --> 01:14:20.413
Jerry.

01:14:22.849 --> 01:14:24.250
Jerry?

01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:25.752
Lights, please.

01:14:31.791 --> 01:14:32.792
Wow.

01:14:43.269 --> 01:14:44.103
Patty.

01:14:53.446 --> 01:14:54.280

Total success, bro,
you are the man.

01:17:19.126 --> 01:17:22.262
So now, tell me how
the ride was with Sam.

01:17:22.362 --> 01:17:23.263
It was fine.

01:17:23.363 --> 01:17:24.264
Fine?

01:17:24.364 --> 01:17:25.599
Well, how was the first kiss?

01:17:25.699 --> 01:17:28.235
There was no kiss.

01:17:28.335 --> 01:17:30.370
I know, I know, there
was this perfect moment

01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:32.272
and I just got nervous.

01:17:32.372 --> 01:17:33.707
I blew it.

01:17:33.807 --> 01:17:36.243
Tuck, yo, she likes
you, I know she likes you.

01:17:36.343 --> 01:17:40.147
You just gotta tell
her how you feel.

01:17:40.247 --> 01:17:41.081
No.

01:17:42.482 --> 01:17:46.086
Yeah, no, no, no, I don't see
that going over very well.

01:17:46.186 --> 01:17:47.521
Just tell her.

01:17:55.162 --> 01:17:56.329
Sam.

01:17:56.429 --> 01:17:57.497
Hello.

01:17:57.597 --> 01:17:58.431
No.

01:18:00.066 --> 01:18:00.901
Hey, Sam.

01:18:02.769 --> 01:18:05.105
No, that's my daddy.

01:18:05.205 --> 01:18:07.174
Hey, Sam, last night was great,

01:18:07.274 --> 01:18:09.910
and you're really great,
and it'd be really great.

01:18:10.010 --> 01:18:11.378
No, no!

01:18:11.478 --> 01:18:12.412
No, no, no.

01:18:14.447 --> 01:18:16.016
Uh, Sam.

01:18:16.116 --> 01:18:17.184
So, Samantha.

01:18:19.152 --> 01:18:21.254
Some good times last night, eh?

01:18:21.354 --> 01:18:22.355
No.

01:18:22.455 --> 01:18:23.290
Uh, hello,

01:18:24.357 --> 01:18:25.525
'sup, God, no.

01:18:30.564 --> 01:18:33.533
Poppy, look, it's a koala bear.

01:18:33.633 --> 01:18:36.670
Oh, man, it was happening again.

01:18:36.770 --> 01:18:39.539
Another round of
guess the species.

01:18:39.639 --> 01:18:42.909
Ha, well, you got
his homeland right,

01:18:44.211 --> 01:18:46.079
but, you see, long ears?

01:18:46.179 --> 01:18:47.614
Long ears.

01:18:47.714 --> 01:18:48.582
And a pouch?

01:18:48.682 --> 01:18:49.716
And a pouch.

01:18:49.816 --> 01:18:50.817
Makes him a kangaroo.

01:18:50.917 --> 01:18:52.485
Kangaroo?
Yup.

01:18:52.586 --> 01:18:54.321
Oh, hallelujah!

01:18:54.421 --> 01:18:56.122
The tourist got it right!

01:18:56.223 --> 01:18:58.124
And you know where
kangaroos come from?

01:18:58.225 --> 01:18:59.492
England?

01:18:59.593 --> 01:19:01.995
No, that's where we come from.

01:19:02.095 --> 01:19:04.598
Hoppy here comes from Australia.

01:19:04.698 --> 01:19:07.434
Oh, I wanted to kiss the guy.

01:19:07.534 --> 01:19:08.702
Poppy and Hoppy.

01:19:08.802 --> 01:19:12.572
Nice to meet you,
Hoppy from Australia.

01:19:12.672 --> 01:19:16.209
Can I please have
your autograph?

01:19:16.309 --> 01:19:18.044
Not you, Fido.

01:19:18.144 --> 01:19:20.380
Mr. Edge, can we please
get your autograph?

01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:22.883
Oh, it'll be my pleasure.

01:19:22.983 --> 01:19:23.817
Edge?

01:19:26.253 --> 01:19:27.621
Holy crap!

01:19:27.721 --> 01:19:30.924
I wanted to yell, "It's Graeme
Edge of the Moody Blues!"

01:19:31.024 --> 01:19:33.260
Poppy, Hoppy knows your name!

01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:34.261
Well, okay.

01:19:34.361 --> 01:19:35.195
Oops.

01:19:36.396 --> 01:19:40.233
Let's say bye-bye to
Hoppy and we'll go.

01:19:40.333 --> 01:19:41.601
We'll go-ho-ho.

01:19:42.736 --> 01:19:44.304
Okay, nobody moves.

01:19:46.306 --> 01:19:49.276
Could I borrow your pen again?

01:19:49.376 --> 01:19:50.210
Thank you.

01:19:51.444 --> 01:19:52.679
Does anybody have
a piece of paper?

01:19:52.779 --> 01:19:56.316
Ah, that will do
nicely, thank you.

01:19:56.416 --> 01:19:58.585
Okay, oh, no, come on.

01:19:58.685 --> 01:20:00.820
Let's do this the
old-fashioned way.

01:20:03.657 --> 01:20:06.092
Okay, Hoppy, have a great day

01:20:07.193 --> 01:20:09.062
at the Old Time Fun Town.

01:20:09.162 --> 01:20:11.431
Ah, oh, oh, my biggest fan.

01:20:13.433 --> 01:20:14.434
Can I have my pen back?

01:20:14.534 --> 01:20:16.569
Jerry, I did it, I did it!

01:20:16.670 --> 01:20:18.538
Oh, man, when you were
screaming, "I did it,"

01:20:18.638 --> 01:20:21.207
I thought you had found at least
one ball and talked to Sam.

01:20:21.308 --> 01:20:23.777
Instead, you show me a
crumpled up park map?

01:20:23.877 --> 01:20:27.113
Look, Jerry, you don't get it.

01:20:27.213 --> 01:20:28.882
This is Graeme Edge!

01:20:29.716 --> 01:20:30.817
Moody Blues?

01:20:30.917 --> 01:20:33.253
Graeme Edge, you're
talking gibberish, man.

01:20:33.353 --> 01:20:35.488
Now focus, we're
talking about Sam, here.

01:20:35.588 --> 01:20:37.357
Now, do you want me
to tell her or what?

01:20:37.457 --> 01:20:38.858
No, Jerry, I'd die.

01:20:38.959 --> 01:20:41.227
Well then, man up and find
the right moment to tell her.

01:20:41.328 --> 01:20:43.196
You owe me, I went through
hell helping you build

01:20:43.296 --> 01:20:45.532
and operate Backyard
Theme Park World

01:20:45.632 --> 01:20:46.833
for you to impress that girl.

01:20:46.933 --> 01:20:50.570
Seriously, man, you
can't fail me now!

01:20:50.670 --> 01:20:51.838
Just tell her.

01:20:56.109 --> 01:20:58.445
Man, I can do this.

01:20:58.545 --> 01:20:59.980
I can do this.

01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:01.114
I just, Sam.

01:21:02.749 --> 01:21:05.151
Sam, I just, I just want to...

01:21:09.089 --> 01:21:09.923
Um,

01:21:11.091 --> 01:21:12.192
listen, listen,

01:21:12.292 --> 01:21:16.463
I gotta say something to you.

01:21:18.431 --> 01:21:19.366
I like you,

01:21:20.467 --> 01:21:21.301
a lot.

01:21:22.635 --> 01:21:24.938
And last night was
almost perfect.

01:21:25.038 --> 01:21:28.208
I just, I just forgot
to do one thing.

01:21:31.644 --> 01:21:33.012
Well, this is awkward.

01:21:38.184 --> 01:21:40.086
Why are you wearing Bowser?

01:21:40.186 --> 01:21:41.488
Covering for Sam.

01:21:41.588 --> 01:21:43.490
You covered for me,
covering for her.

01:21:43.590 --> 01:21:44.758
Well, where is she?

01:21:44.858 --> 01:21:48.294
I don't know, I'm not Match.com.

01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:55.969
Stu, thank you so much
for covering for me!

01:21:57.904 --> 01:21:58.938
Everybody wants me today.

01:21:59.039 --> 01:22:00.673
Tucker, Tucker, you did it!

01:22:00.774 --> 01:22:02.208
You did it, Daniel
isn't quitting,

01:22:02.308 --> 01:22:04.277
I took him to dialysis this
morning, I could just...

Losers.

01:24:06.332 --> 01:24:07.834
Okay, guys, look.

01:24:07.934 --> 01:24:09.169
Everybody stay calm.

01:24:09.269 --> 01:24:10.937
We took the stuff from the
warehouse for the old people

01:24:11.037 --> 01:24:12.772
and for Sam and we're
going to return it.

01:24:12.872 --> 01:24:15.041
It was all for a good
cause, so everybody chill

01:24:15.141 --> 01:24:17.143
and I'll do the talking.

01:24:34.527 --> 01:24:35.662
It was them, they did it,

01:24:35.762 --> 01:24:37.230
they stole that stuff
from the warehouse.

01:24:37.330 --> 01:24:40.500
I'm innocent, I was at
a cosplay convention.

01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:42.735
A what convention?

01:24:42.835 --> 01:24:44.103
Never mind.

01:24:44.204 --> 01:24:46.005
I'll tell you what,
I'll take your statement

01:24:46.105 --> 01:24:47.674
about the warehouse
robbery later.

01:24:47.774 --> 01:24:50.443
Right now, what I need you to do

01:24:50.543 --> 01:24:52.745
is to turn that
off, turn off the,

01:24:55.882 --> 01:24:57.383
turn it off, man, just this,

01:24:58.585 --> 01:24:59.319
no drips.

01:24:59.419 --> 01:25:00.253
But I...

01:25:00.353 --> 01:25:02.488
Oh, ah, zip it, just, mm,

01:25:04.691 --> 01:25:05.592
you zip it.

01:25:06.926 --> 01:25:09.596
And you, you look damn familiar.

01:25:12.231 --> 01:25:16.369
Lady and gentlemen, I
have something I'd like

01:25:16.469 --> 01:25:19.105
for the four of you
to take a look at.

01:25:19.205 --> 01:25:21.207
Viola, otherwise, voilà.

01:26:05.852 --> 01:26:08.688
Do you have any idea

01:26:08.788 --> 01:26:11.124
how much trouble you are in?

01:26:12.158 --> 01:26:13.559
We didn't do this.

01:26:13.660 --> 01:26:15.094
Oh, cut this, cut this,

01:26:15.194 --> 01:26:18.131
"I'm so innocent as a little
baby green puppy, I didn't.

01:26:20.033 --> 01:26:22.068
"I'm innocent, I swear to God!"

01:26:27.573 --> 01:26:29.942
I ain't buying, baby.

01:26:30.043 --> 01:26:32.378
But I am, we are innocent.

01:26:33.646 --> 01:26:36.215
And you are just
the happy little

01:26:36.316 --> 01:26:38.084
toucan camper,
aren't you, with the,

01:26:42.088 --> 01:26:43.389
with the bird stuff, man.

01:26:43.489 --> 01:26:46.125
What up with the
bird stuff, toucan?

01:26:46.225 --> 01:26:48.461
Man, I'm a, I'm a parrot.

01:26:49.796 --> 01:26:52.031
And you, I have no
idea what you sound like.

01:26:53.833 --> 01:26:55.334
Sir, don't we get a phone call?

01:26:55.435 --> 01:26:57.503
Oh, you do get your
phone call, Hoppy.

01:26:57.603 --> 01:26:59.072
You're gonna get
your phone call,

01:26:59.172 --> 01:27:01.340
but you gotta understand something,
it's gonna be more like,

01:27:03.576 --> 01:27:04.811
"Hello, hello?"

01:27:04.911 --> 01:27:07.080
"I'm sorry but Hoppy
is going to prison

01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:09.348
"for a very, very long time,

01:27:09.449 --> 01:27:12.251
"for more information,
please press pound,

01:27:12.352 --> 01:27:16.155
"oh, press pound again."

01:27:16.255 --> 01:27:19.726
By the way, are you sure I
don't know you from somewhere?

01:27:19.826 --> 01:27:21.194
Uh, excuse me, sir?

01:27:21.294 --> 01:27:22.128
Yes?

01:27:23.463 --> 01:27:25.665
Could you please play
that one more time?

01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:28.367
Seriously?

01:27:28.468 --> 01:27:30.136
You want me to play this again?

01:27:30.236 --> 01:27:31.771
You all get off on
doing stuff to people?

01:27:31.871 --> 01:27:33.539
You all get off on this,
is that what this is?

01:27:33.639 --> 01:27:36.309
Is this like a, like a,
like a quadro-freaky thing?

01:27:36.409 --> 01:27:37.910
Sure, why not?

01:27:38.010 --> 01:27:42.181
Y'all must be getting off on
crimes and hurting people.

01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:03.237
I can't believe you guys
used my costume for a crime.

01:28:03.337 --> 01:28:05.739
When did these happen?

01:28:05.839 --> 01:28:09.109
How about you let me ask
the questions, shall we?

01:28:09.209 --> 01:28:12.212
Where were you at 4:55 PM yesterday?

01:28:13.914 --> 01:28:15.149
We were at a party...

01:28:18.385 --> 01:28:20.020
No, we weren't there!

01:28:22.122 --> 01:28:23.157
Excuse me, Detective,

01:28:23.257 --> 01:28:24.691
we need to see you for
a minute over here.

01:28:24.792 --> 01:28:25.626
Stay.

01:28:29.429 --> 01:28:30.164
Thanks a lot.

01:28:30.264 --> 01:28:31.365
I cannot believe that.

01:28:31.465 --> 01:28:34.601
Why would you tell him that...

01:28:34.701 --> 01:28:35.436
It wasn't us!

01:28:37.538 --> 01:28:40.140
Okay, here's the news.

01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:41.708
The three of you's
alibis check out

01:28:41.809 --> 01:28:45.012
and you are very
lucky, graffiti boy.

01:28:46.113 --> 01:28:47.347
I know you now.

01:28:48.615 --> 01:28:51.018
What are you three
sitting around here for?

01:28:51.118 --> 01:28:52.119
You are free to go.

01:28:53.053 --> 01:28:54.388
Let's go, scoot.

01:28:55.489 --> 01:28:56.223
Scoot, scoot, scoot.

01:28:56.323 --> 01:28:57.925
Not you, stay here.

01:28:59.927 --> 01:29:02.396
Cosplay is not even a real word.

01:29:02.496 --> 01:29:03.630
You're up to something,

01:29:03.730 --> 01:29:05.966
and I'm gonna figure
out what this is.

01:29:06.066 --> 01:29:06.900
Karma!

01:29:08.101 --> 01:29:09.436
So when we were borrowing props

01:29:09.536 --> 01:29:11.805
from the old warehouse, we
found these duplicate costumes.

01:29:11.905 --> 01:29:14.408
Oh, those film-flammers
needed a disguise

01:29:14.508 --> 01:29:15.876
to do the crimes.

01:29:15.976 --> 01:29:17.544
Yeah, you know, it didn't
make sense at the time

01:29:17.644 --> 01:29:20.747
until we saw the hand gestures
from the surveillance video.

01:29:20.848 --> 01:29:22.850
The ops guys were setting us up.

01:29:22.950 --> 01:29:25.052
They were giving you
the old rigmarole.

01:29:25.152 --> 01:29:28.222
You dumb mugs were
the perfect patsies.

01:29:28.322 --> 01:29:31.325
Luckily, your story
was bought by the dick.

01:29:31.425 --> 01:29:33.260
Let's just say detective.

01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:34.828
We gotta clear Stu.

01:29:34.928 --> 01:29:36.063
Do we?

01:29:36.163 --> 01:29:37.464
Let's get back to the
21st century, all right?

01:29:37.564 --> 01:29:39.900
These were duplicate costumes
that we've never worn.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.068
Think about how much we sweat?

01:29:41.168 --> 01:29:42.669
You're right, man,
those costumes have got

01:29:42.769 --> 01:29:44.204
to be dripping with their DNA.

01:29:44.304 --> 01:29:46.440
We get the costumes to the
cops, they do a forensics.

01:29:46.540 --> 01:29:48.508
Yeah, so let's go
back, we'll suit up,

01:29:48.609 --> 01:29:50.010
and just act like
nothing ever happened.

01:29:50.110 --> 01:29:51.445
That's a suicide mission.

01:29:51.545 --> 01:29:53.046
Yeah, there's no way
they're gonna let us back

01:29:53.146 --> 01:29:54.848
into the warehouse now.

01:29:54.948 --> 01:29:56.350
They're probably
watching it like a...

01:29:56.450 --> 01:29:58.886
But with a little diversion
from our friends here...

01:29:58.986 --> 01:30:00.420
We're in!

01:30:10.063 --> 01:30:12.165
The kittens are handed.

01:30:17.437 --> 01:30:21.508
What time does the three
o'clock parade start?

01:30:21.608 --> 01:30:22.342
What?

01:30:23.477 --> 01:30:25.512
What time does the three...

01:32:01.441 --> 01:32:03.243
Let's go, put it
in the bag, put it.

01:32:03.343 --> 01:32:04.111
Okay.

01:32:04.211 --> 01:32:04.945
Hurry up.

01:32:06.246 --> 01:32:08.281
Well, well, well,
looks like the felons

01:32:08.382 --> 01:32:10.350
have returned to the
scene of the crime.

01:32:10.450 --> 01:32:11.818
Oh, thanks for bagging
that up for us.

01:32:11.918 --> 01:32:13.654
They have a date
with the incinerator.

01:32:13.754 --> 01:32:15.088
I don't think so, man.

01:32:15.188 --> 01:32:16.857
Stu's at the general
manager's office right now

01:32:16.957 --> 01:32:18.492
telling Mr. Fletcher
that it was you guys

01:32:18.592 --> 01:32:22.062
robbing people blind with
your little hand gestures.

01:32:22.162 --> 01:32:23.930
Yeah.
Right.

01:32:24.031 --> 01:32:24.865
Great job, guys.

01:32:24.965 --> 01:32:25.799
Yes!

01:32:27.768 --> 01:32:29.269
Not you, idiots.

01:32:30.604 --> 01:32:31.938
Great job, guys.

01:32:36.109 --> 01:32:37.677
You know, it was...

01:32:38.879 --> 01:32:40.247
You know it has
always been my plan

01:32:40.347 --> 01:32:41.748
to cash in on this joint,

01:32:41.848 --> 01:32:43.383
a little skimming, a
little book-making,

01:32:43.483 --> 01:32:46.720
they were all well and
good as far as they went,

01:32:46.820 --> 01:32:48.221
but nothing has
been as lucrative

01:32:48.321 --> 01:32:51.792
as our little
character crime spree.

01:32:51.892 --> 01:32:53.660
Robbing the bank was
a little over the top,

01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:56.696
and we will have
a chat about that.

01:32:58.732 --> 01:32:59.833
And I would have
gotten away with it,

01:32:59.933 --> 01:33:02.536
if it hadn't been for
you meddling kids.

01:33:02.636 --> 01:33:03.737
Ruh-roh.

01:33:03.837 --> 01:33:06.673
But hey, thanks for
doing your part.

01:33:06.773 --> 01:33:09.776
We have made obscene
amounts of money,

01:33:09.876 --> 01:33:12.412
and now it's time for us to
ride off into the sunset,

01:33:12.512 --> 01:33:14.414
and for you to disappear.

01:33:14.514 --> 01:33:16.750
George, you're in my light.

01:33:19.052 --> 01:33:21.655
And now I've lost my train
of thought altogether.

01:33:21.755 --> 01:33:24.124
Fine, you, go get the
van, bring it around.

01:33:24.224 --> 01:33:28.395
The rest of you clean up this
mess and vanish this janitor.

01:33:55.222 --> 01:33:56.790
Freeze!

01:33:56.890 --> 01:33:59.059
Ringleader, he goes.

01:33:59.159 --> 01:34:01.728
Anybody with a blue shirt goes.

01:34:03.096 --> 01:34:05.165
Hey, man, is that wedgie?

01:34:07.167 --> 01:34:08.602
The rest of the summer

01:34:08.702 --> 01:34:10.504
wasn't nearly as exciting,

01:34:10.604 --> 01:34:13.540
and since the cops took
the costumes as evidence,

01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:14.975
we were forced to work with

01:34:15.075 --> 01:34:17.711
whatever we could
get our hands on.

01:34:17.811 --> 01:34:20.147
Hoppy's Kangaroo Krew
was back together.

01:34:20.247 --> 01:34:21.882
Even though some of the costumes

01:34:21.982 --> 01:34:26.520
came from unusual sources,
the kids still loved us,

01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:30.190
and before we knew it,
the summer was over.

01:34:31.658 --> 01:34:36.029
That fall, Stu started his own
furry cosplay costume company

01:34:36.129 --> 01:34:40.200
and his products are a huge
hit with the alternative crowd.

01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:43.537
And you won't believe who
Stu's top sales agents are.

01:34:43.637 --> 01:34:45.772
Bonus checks.

01:34:45.872 --> 01:34:46.706
Yeah!

01:34:48.575 --> 01:34:50.911
Ladies, five, six, seven, eight.

01:34:51.011 --> 01:34:52.779
Even though the park was mothballed

01:34:52.879 --> 01:34:56.483
for the winter, Jerry was
asked to stay on full-time

01:34:56.583 --> 01:35:00.453
and got a promotion to
Director of Entertainment.

01:35:00.554 --> 01:35:01.421
Ha, my man!

01:35:02.822 --> 01:35:05.158
The next summer, he
created a hit musical

01:35:05.258 --> 01:35:06.893
on Fletcher's old stage.

01:35:06.993 --> 01:35:09.596
George, love it, give me some!

01:35:09.696 --> 01:35:10.864
Sam?

01:35:10.964 --> 01:35:12.199
Well, she went off to California

01:35:12.299 --> 01:35:14.901
and is working on her
degree in elder care,

01:35:15.001 --> 01:35:17.304
and I made it to
California, too.

01:35:17.404 --> 01:35:18.638
How, you ask?

01:35:18.738 --> 01:35:21.241
Turns out I have some
fans that started

01:35:21.341 --> 01:35:23.977
the Tucker Goes to
CalArts Scholarship Fund.

01:35:24.077 --> 01:35:24.911
Whoa!

01:35:26.613 --> 01:35:28.381
Thank you, sir, guys!

01:35:32.385 --> 01:35:34.221
Oh, no, Daniel, this
is way too much.

01:35:34.321 --> 01:35:35.455
Ah, keep it, kid.

01:35:35.555 --> 01:35:37.157
We're not in here
because we're bored.

01:35:37.257 --> 01:35:38.491
We're just old.

01:35:38.592 --> 01:35:39.693
Yeah.

01:35:41.261 --> 01:35:43.830
So, life is good.

01:35:43.930 --> 01:35:45.832
I'm not sure what
the future holds

01:35:45.932 --> 01:35:48.368
or what kind of adults
we'll turn out to be,

01:35:48.468 --> 01:35:50.370
but I know that, deep down,

01:35:50.470 --> 01:35:52.706
we'll always be Characterz.

01:35:53.974 --> 01:35:55.242
Yeah, with a Z.

01:38:36.269 --> 01:38:38.338
That turtle sank like a stone.

01:38:40.006 --> 01:38:40.840
Oh!

01:38:48.815 --> 01:38:50.950
Do you remember writing this?

01:38:51.050 --> 01:38:52.986
I don't remember this part.

01:38:53.086 --> 01:38:54.921
"Oh, my gosh, was he all right?

01:38:55.021 --> 01:38:57.123
"Insert funny line here."
