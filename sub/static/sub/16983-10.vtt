WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:03.502
If the theory of evolution is correct,

00:03.537 --> 00:06.372
we should see a steady,
slow progression.

00:06.407 --> 00:08.073
We're actually not seeing that.

00:08.109 --> 00:09.875
What we're seeing, really,

00:09.910 --> 00:12.811
is something like out of
The Lord of the Rings.

00:12.847 --> 00:15.647
You have a group of people indigenous

00:15.683 --> 00:17.716
to this planet,
and you really can't trace

00:17.752 --> 00:19.184
what their ancestry was.

00:19.220 --> 00:23.222
The planet has been an experimental lab.

00:23.257 --> 00:25.491
At this point, we don't know exactly why

00:25.526 --> 00:27.659
these other species died off.

00:29.864 --> 00:31.296
Could this be an experiment

00:31.332 --> 00:34.099
by extraterrestrials where, in the end,

00:34.135 --> 00:36.502
only Homo sapiens survived?

00:36.537 --> 00:39.905
Since the dawn of civilization,

00:39.940 --> 00:43.942
mankind has credited its origins to gods

00:43.978 --> 00:46.311
and other visitors from the stars.

00:46.347 --> 00:48.814
What if it were true?

00:48.849 --> 00:51.984
Did extraterrestrial beings

00:52.019 --> 00:55.087
really help to shape our history?

00:55.122 --> 00:58.590
And if so, might the proof be found

00:58.626 --> 01:02.361
by investigating the prototypes?

# Ancient Aliens 11x10 #
The Prototypes
Original Air Date on July 22, 2016

01:33.327 --> 01:38.030
Temple University, Philadelphia. 1992.

01:38.065 --> 01:40.899
History professor Dr. David Jacobs

01:40.935 --> 01:44.470
releases his book Secret Life.

01:46.507 --> 01:50.542
After over 30 years of
collecting research data

01:50.578 --> 01:53.345
and interviewing hundreds of individuals

01:53.380 --> 01:57.015
claiming to have been abducted
by extraterrestrials,

01:57.051 --> 02:00.786
Jacobs became convinced
that aliens were using Earth

02:00.821 --> 02:02.654
as a genetic laboratory

02:02.690 --> 02:07.426
to create a new species
of alien-human hybrids.

02:09.497 --> 02:12.164
I've looked at about 1,150,

02:12.199 --> 02:14.733
1,175 different abduction events,

02:14.768 --> 02:20.105
and I became convinced
that this was the real item,

02:20.141 --> 02:22.541
that the people actually
were being abducted.

02:22.576 --> 02:26.712
And they all say the same thing,
and it's global.

02:26.747 --> 02:28.580
They're put on a table,

02:28.616 --> 02:31.950
there are procedures
that are applied to them.

02:31.986 --> 02:34.553
Men have sperm taken from them;

02:34.588 --> 02:37.289
women have eggs taken from them.

02:39.260 --> 02:42.761
Very often, they're
taken into other rooms

02:42.796 --> 02:47.499
where they see babies who look odd,

02:47.535 --> 02:50.736
look sort of like a cross
between human and alien babies.

02:50.771 --> 02:54.806
The question is:
are humans being manipulated

02:54.842 --> 02:59.311
to become a hybrid species themselves?

03:03.450 --> 03:05.450
Although critics acknowledge

03:05.486 --> 03:09.521
that Dr. Jacobs' research
is meticulous and methodical,

03:09.557 --> 03:14.226
they continue to dismiss the
abduction phenomenon entirely.

03:14.261 --> 03:16.962
But could it be that extraterrestrials

03:16.997 --> 03:19.665
are actually using human DNA

03:19.700 --> 03:23.402
to add a new branch
to the evolutionary tree?

03:23.437 --> 03:26.805
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes,

03:26.840 --> 03:28.740
and they suggest that,

03:28.776 --> 03:31.977
while modern-day abduction
stories are compelling,

03:32.012 --> 03:34.546
the answer might best be found

03:34.582 --> 03:38.050
by examining mankind's very beginnings

03:38.085 --> 03:41.720
and the numerous other
human-like species

03:41.755 --> 03:44.156
with whom we once shared the Earth.

03:53.767 --> 03:56.835
Gauteng Province, South Africa.

03:56.870 --> 04:00.472
September 13, 2013.

04:00.507 --> 04:05.043
Recreational spelunkers unearth a trove

04:05.079 --> 04:08.747
of human-like fossils
deposited deep inside a cavern

04:08.782 --> 04:12.050
known as the Rising Star Cave.

04:12.086 --> 04:15.854
Paleoanthropologists
determine that the bones

04:15.889 --> 04:17.456
are remarkably distinctive

04:17.491 --> 04:21.627
from any previously found
early human remains,

04:21.661 --> 04:23.662
and upon further examination,

04:23.697 --> 04:28.033
decide that they are
actually not human at all,

04:28.068 --> 04:33.171
adding a startling new piece
to the evolutionary puzzle.

04:33.207 --> 04:37.109
They call this new species Homo naledi

04:37.144 --> 04:41.013
to correspond with the Dinaledi
chamber it was discovered in,

04:41.048 --> 04:44.650
which translates to
"chamber of stars".

04:47.321 --> 04:49.588
What is remarkable about these hominids

04:49.623 --> 04:52.424
is that they are a distinctive mix

04:52.459 --> 04:55.160
of both primitive

04:55.195 --> 04:58.196
and more advanced
hominid characteristics.

04:58.232 --> 05:00.999
So there are some elements
of Homo naledi,

05:01.035 --> 05:04.503
like the shape of the skull,
the size of the teeth,

05:04.538 --> 05:09.541
the feet, the ankles,
that are very human-like.

05:09.576 --> 05:12.711
There are other characteristics,
like the brain size,

05:12.746 --> 05:14.746
only about 500 ccs,

05:14.782 --> 05:17.449
so about a third of
modern human brain size,

05:17.484 --> 05:20.118
and also aspects of
the shoulder and the trunk

05:20.154 --> 05:22.788
that are much more primitive,

05:22.823 --> 05:27.526
much more similar to our
earlier hominin ancestors.

05:27.561 --> 05:29.728
The original thought is this might be,

05:29.763 --> 05:31.763
really, the first humans of Africa,

05:31.799 --> 05:34.032
seven to three million years ago.

05:34.068 --> 05:35.667
But this cave seemed newer.

05:35.703 --> 05:40.505
The way the bodies were placed
seemed almost too regular.

05:40.541 --> 05:43.608
It looked as if there was
at least ceremony

05:43.644 --> 05:45.577
to what was being done.

05:45.612 --> 05:49.147
And that, of course, suggests
this would be a fairly well-on

05:49.183 --> 05:50.649
evolutionary advanced creature.

05:53.487 --> 05:55.654
Finding the Homo naledi bones

05:55.689 --> 05:58.190
is considered the most astonishing

05:58.225 --> 06:02.694
human fossil discovery
of the last 50 years,

06:02.730 --> 06:07.566
as it adds a baffling new branch
to the human family tree.

06:10.637 --> 06:13.238
This is a tremendously exciting time.

06:13.273 --> 06:15.741
Both the fossil and the genetic evidence

06:15.776 --> 06:19.478
really underscore that there
is much more diversity

06:19.513 --> 06:21.646
in human forms in our evolutionary past

06:21.682 --> 06:23.248
than we previously recognized.

06:25.152 --> 06:27.052
The hominin, or hominid,

06:27.087 --> 06:31.022
branch of the evolutionary tree
includes modern humans,

06:31.058 --> 06:33.992
as well as the extinct
human predecessors

06:34.027 --> 06:37.195
such as Neanderthal,

06:37.231 --> 06:40.665
Homo habilis, Homo erectus,

06:40.701 --> 06:43.535
and other early,
intelligent standing primates

06:43.570 --> 06:46.638
that have long since vanished.

06:46.673 --> 06:49.508
And despite many years
of thinking otherwise,

06:49.543 --> 06:52.110
scientists are now discovering

06:52.146 --> 06:54.946
that many of these species co-existed.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.284
What we're seeing, really,

06:59.319 --> 07:01.953
is something like out of
The Lord of the Rings,

07:01.989 --> 07:07.626
where we have all kinds
of different humanoids

07:07.661 --> 07:10.729
who are tall and short,

07:10.764 --> 07:15.133
who have different color skins,
different types of hair.

07:15.169 --> 07:19.104
Even their brains
are slightly different.

07:19.139 --> 07:22.140
Some are more animals or apes.

07:22.176 --> 07:24.409
Others are more refined.

07:27.581 --> 07:29.714
Some researchers suggest

07:29.750 --> 07:33.518
that these recent discoveries
may require a retooling

07:33.554 --> 07:35.387
of Darwin's theory of evolution,

07:35.422 --> 07:39.558
which was first proposed in 1859.

07:39.593 --> 07:42.794
In his work On the Origin of Species,

07:42.830 --> 07:46.765
Darwin laid out the foundation
for evolutionary theory

07:46.800 --> 07:50.836
by proposing that gradual
multigenerational changes,

07:50.871 --> 07:53.705
occurring due to natural selection,

07:53.740 --> 07:57.609
would result in the modification
of existing species.

08:00.547 --> 08:02.948
If the theory of evolution is correct,

08:02.983 --> 08:05.684
we should see a steady,
slow progression.

08:05.719 --> 08:08.220
We're actually not seeing that.

08:08.255 --> 08:11.923
We're seeing the sudden
surfacing of early humans

08:11.959 --> 08:15.694
who are actually very highly evolved.

08:15.729 --> 08:18.597
The scientific community
explains everything away

08:18.632 --> 08:20.232
by nothing else

08:20.267 --> 08:23.301
but natural selection and coincidence.

08:23.337 --> 08:25.470
And the intelligent design camp

08:25.506 --> 08:29.341
suggests everything was done by God.

08:29.376 --> 08:33.979
What if this external force
did in fact exist?

08:34.014 --> 08:37.381
But it may have been
an extraterrestrial.

08:41.755 --> 08:44.623
Could it be that the
evolution of humans,

08:44.658 --> 08:46.658
and even prehuman hominin,

08:46.693 --> 08:50.328
might not be entirely
what Darwin proposed?

08:52.332 --> 08:56.134
Might there be an even
more profound explanation

08:56.169 --> 08:59.304
for the different species
of intelligent hominin

08:59.339 --> 09:02.374
that once existed on Earth?

09:02.409 --> 09:06.778
Perhaps clues can be found
by exploring the details

09:06.813 --> 09:10.215
contained within some of
humanity's earliest stories

09:10.250 --> 09:12.350
of our creation.

09:14.988 --> 09:17.923
We have this notion that the people

09:17.958 --> 09:21.026
that were the earliest
examples of a civilization

09:21.061 --> 09:24.396
were not the first attempts,

09:24.431 --> 09:27.198
that there were failures
that came before,

09:27.234 --> 09:29.834
and finally they would come up
with something better,

09:29.870 --> 09:32.904
and that would be the prototype
that became the people.

09:32.940 --> 09:36.308
Sumerian texts speak of deformed humans

09:36.343 --> 09:39.277
created by Enki and
the mother goddess Ninhursag

09:39.313 --> 09:43.381
in the course of their efforts
to fashion a perfect person.

09:43.417 --> 09:45.750
In all, six protohumans were made

09:45.786 --> 09:49.487
before they came up
with what they wanted.

09:49.523 --> 09:53.858
In the Mayan text the Popol Vuh,
"the Book of the People",

09:53.894 --> 09:56.461
it is said that there were
three attempts to make people.

10:01.768 --> 10:04.102
Could the stories of gods creating

10:04.137 --> 10:05.937
multiple versions of man--

10:05.973 --> 10:09.341
which can be found in
the Mayan Popol Vuh,

10:09.376 --> 10:13.178
the ancient Sumerian texts
and other writings--

10:13.213 --> 10:16.281
be accounts of what
actually happened on Earth

10:16.316 --> 10:18.984
in the distant past?

10:19.019 --> 10:22.420
And if so, just who were these gods?

10:24.992 --> 10:29.060
There's a very good chance
that early humans were possibly

10:29.096 --> 10:33.064
genetically manipulated by
advanced extraterrestrials

10:33.100 --> 10:37.502
trying to formulate and create
the ultimate human species.

10:39.640 --> 10:43.875
What if at the heart
of it is the concept

10:43.910 --> 10:48.313
that the planet itself has
been an experimental lab,

10:48.348 --> 10:50.281
an experimental garden,

10:50.317 --> 10:53.351
and that all of these different
models getting to Homo sapien,

10:53.387 --> 10:56.354
that there had been all kinds of models,

10:56.390 --> 11:00.058
all for different reasons,
all part of tests,

11:00.093 --> 11:04.863
all done by DNA manipulation by nonhumans

11:04.898 --> 11:07.298
in the extraterrestrial category.

11:09.069 --> 11:11.002
Could the widespread mythologies

11:11.038 --> 11:14.873
about the creation of
various human prototypes

11:14.908 --> 11:17.909
be real accounts of
an extraterrestrial experiment,

11:17.944 --> 11:22.147
an experiment that
continues to this day?

11:22.182 --> 11:25.917
Perhaps further clues can be found

11:25.952 --> 11:29.254
by examining the fossil discovery

11:29.289 --> 11:31.556
of real-life hobbits.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.261
There is a new species

11:36.296 --> 11:40.265
that's come straight
out of the incubator.

11:40.300 --> 11:43.968
Some people have
suggested that this island

11:44.004 --> 11:46.171
served as some type of a petri dish.

11:48.000 --> 11:48.500
_

11:53.705 --> 11:56.339
The Indonesian island of Flores,

11:56.375 --> 11:58.208
just north of Australia.

11:58.243 --> 12:02.045
September 6, 2003.

12:02.080 --> 12:04.381
Archaeologists seeking evidence

12:04.416 --> 12:07.984
for the first Homo sapiens
migration to Indonesia

12:08.020 --> 12:12.322
come upon what they believe
is the skull of a human child,

12:12.357 --> 12:14.057
embedded in the earth

12:14.092 --> 12:18.928
20 feet beneath the surface
of Liang Bua Cave.

12:18.964 --> 12:22.399
After several days
of careful excavation,

12:22.434 --> 12:26.002
enough of the cranium
and mandible are exposed

12:26.038 --> 12:29.105
to reveal that the teeth
belong not to a child,

12:29.141 --> 12:32.142
but to a fully grown adult.

12:32.177 --> 12:36.046
The skull, along with
the skeletal remains

12:36.081 --> 12:39.783
that were recovered weeks later,
belong to an ancient hominin

12:39.818 --> 12:42.952
that stood only
three-and-a-half feet tall.

12:42.988 --> 12:47.357
Scientists name the species
Homo floresiensis,

12:47.392 --> 12:51.227
but they are more commonly
referred to as "the hobbits".

12:54.566 --> 12:58.501
The Flores hominids date to
16,000 to 18,000 years ago,

12:58.537 --> 13:01.571
a time period when, we thought,

13:01.606 --> 13:05.075
only anatomically modern humans existed.

13:05.110 --> 13:08.478
What is remarkable about
the Flores remains

13:08.513 --> 13:11.047
is their tiny, tiny body size.

13:11.083 --> 13:15.351
And as well, at least one of
the specimens has a brain size

13:15.387 --> 13:19.756
that is only about the size
of a chimpanzee, 300 to 400 ccs.

13:19.791 --> 13:23.259
And yet you have tools
that are consistent

13:23.295 --> 13:25.595
with anatomically modern humans.

13:25.630 --> 13:29.399
How to reconcile that
is still an open question.

13:29.434 --> 13:32.902
The recent discoveries of these hobbits

13:32.938 --> 13:35.672
on the island of Flores in Indonesia

13:35.707 --> 13:39.709
has really rocked the
anthropological world.

13:39.744 --> 13:43.880
And anthropologists
were really not aware

13:43.915 --> 13:46.382
and didn't think that there would be

13:46.418 --> 13:49.119
this miniature type of person,

13:49.154 --> 13:53.123
who's a distinct species
from Homo sapiens.

13:57.696 --> 13:59.562
Prehistoric stone tools

13:59.598 --> 14:01.898
found on the island of Flores

14:01.933 --> 14:04.300
suggest that these so-called hobbits

14:04.336 --> 14:07.737
may have arrived there
800,000 years prior.

14:12.177 --> 14:16.112
How did this species get to the island?

14:16.148 --> 14:19.582
So there are two options
how this could have happened.

14:19.618 --> 14:25.221
One is that these hobbit people
arrived there on boats,

14:25.257 --> 14:28.625
or they were planted there

14:28.660 --> 14:33.062
by extraterrestrials in the remote past.

14:33.098 --> 14:36.299
Some people even have suggested
that this island served

14:36.334 --> 14:40.336
as some type of a petri dish
because of its isolation.

14:45.310 --> 14:48.745
Seven years after the
initial Flores discovery,

14:48.780 --> 14:52.315
archaeologists stumble across
yet another new species

14:52.350 --> 14:53.917
8,000 miles away

14:53.952 --> 14:58.388
in the remote
Altai Mountains of Siberia.

14:58.423 --> 15:00.256
Isolated in a cave

15:00.292 --> 15:04.394
at an elevation over
2,400 feet above sea level,

15:04.429 --> 15:08.498
scientists discover a finger
bone fragment and tooth

15:08.533 --> 15:10.900
of a previously unknown prehuman

15:10.936 --> 15:14.904
that existed at least 40,000 years ago.

15:14.940 --> 15:18.041
They name the species Denisovan,

15:18.076 --> 15:21.277
after the name of the cave
that the bones were found in.

15:23.415 --> 15:25.782
It's particularly fascinating
that when we look

15:25.817 --> 15:28.885
at the geographical distribution
of the early humans,

15:28.920 --> 15:31.888
they're in different parts of the world.

15:31.923 --> 15:35.158
We have the Denisovans
in Siberia and Russia.

15:35.193 --> 15:38.294
We have Homo floresiensis
on the island of Flores.

15:38.330 --> 15:40.797
And the list goes on.

15:40.832 --> 15:44.567
It begs the question:
How would that happen?

15:44.603 --> 15:46.536
Why would it not be the case

15:46.571 --> 15:49.005
that multiple different types of human

15:49.040 --> 15:50.406
would appear in multiple areas?

15:50.442 --> 15:53.509
But they had their own
geographical location.

15:57.148 --> 16:00.183
Discoveries made in just
the last two decades

16:00.218 --> 16:03.152
paint a picture of at least
four distinct groups

16:03.188 --> 16:05.054
of intelligent hominins

16:05.090 --> 16:09.092
existing in isolated
pockets of the world:

16:09.127 --> 16:13.696
Homo floresiensis, isolated
on the island of Flores,

16:13.732 --> 16:18.568
Denisovans being found in the
Altai Mountains of Siberia,

16:18.603 --> 16:23.106
Neanderthal found occupying
Western Europe,

16:23.141 --> 16:26.843
and anatomically modern humans
evolving in Africa.

16:29.881 --> 16:31.848
Scientists don't entirely understand

16:31.883 --> 16:33.783
the role of geographic isolation,

16:33.818 --> 16:38.788
but what we know from studies
of island populations

16:38.823 --> 16:42.659
of both humans and
nonhuman species today

16:42.694 --> 16:45.662
is that isolated environments
are fertile ground

16:45.697 --> 16:50.166
for producing unique and
distinctive adaptations

16:50.201 --> 16:53.636
and also extremes in body size.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.674
In 1972,

16:57.709 --> 17:01.411
renowned evolutionary theorist
Dr. Stephen Jay Gould

17:01.446 --> 17:06.214
proposed a modification to
the standard model of evolution.

17:06.251 --> 17:11.119
His punctuated equilibrium
theory addressed evidence

17:11.156 --> 17:13.156
that changes in the fossil record

17:13.191 --> 17:16.559
came not as a steady
process of gradual evolution,

17:16.594 --> 17:19.628
as proposed by Darwin,

17:19.664 --> 17:22.265
but rather in fits and starts.

17:23.902 --> 17:27.603
And these rapid changes
seemed to primarily occur

17:27.638 --> 17:30.506
in situations of isolation.

17:30.542 --> 17:35.545
His theory continues to be
considered controversial,

17:35.580 --> 17:38.481
as it also suggested
that there must've been

17:38.516 --> 17:40.750
an unknown mechanism at play.

17:40.785 --> 17:43.720
But his research stops short of defining

17:43.755 --> 17:46.589
what this could have been.

17:50.228 --> 17:54.130
We don't have the step-by-step changes

17:54.165 --> 17:57.100
that we were expecting to find.

17:57.135 --> 17:59.302
So we have to ask ourselves,
is there really

17:59.337 --> 18:02.638
this slow random evolution?

18:02.674 --> 18:05.942
Or are there sudden leaps,

18:05.977 --> 18:10.446
where suddenly there is
a new kind of species

18:10.482 --> 18:14.350
that's just come straight
out of the incubator?

18:14.386 --> 18:19.021
And so it's like we have these
different species of humans

18:19.057 --> 18:21.424
that are being developed in isolation

18:21.459 --> 18:23.893
in different parts of the world.

18:23.928 --> 18:25.728
Extraterrestrials would

18:25.764 --> 18:29.065
use islands for one experiment,

18:29.100 --> 18:31.968
tops of mountains
for another experiment.

18:32.003 --> 18:36.706
But they would control what
they were doing by keeping

18:36.741 --> 18:39.742
their different experiments
separated from each other--

18:39.778 --> 18:42.612
oceans, mountains,

18:42.647 --> 18:45.481
islands, peninsulas.

18:45.517 --> 18:48.584
If you subscribe to the zoo hypothesis,

18:48.620 --> 18:52.422
which suggests that this
entire planet is nothing else

18:52.457 --> 18:55.491
but an experiment for
extraterrestrial entities,

18:55.527 --> 18:57.593
then one has to wonder:

18:57.629 --> 19:00.763
Could this be an experiment
by extraterrestrials

19:00.799 --> 19:04.934
where, in the end, only
Homo sapiens survived?

19:08.273 --> 19:10.706
Could remote areas of the globe

19:10.742 --> 19:13.976
have served as extraterrestrial
incubation sites

19:14.012 --> 19:16.779
for protohuman development?

19:16.815 --> 19:20.483
If so, was the experiment eradicated

19:20.518 --> 19:23.953
to make room for the
growth of Homo sapiens?

19:23.988 --> 19:26.889
Perhaps further clues
can be found by taking

19:26.925 --> 19:31.661
a closer examination of our
nearest evolutionary cousin--

19:31.696 --> 19:33.963
the Neanderthal.

19:36.568 --> 19:40.803
It doesn't look like
a lack of intelligence led

19:40.839 --> 19:42.672
to the demise of Neanderthals.

19:42.707 --> 19:44.740
This was extraterrestrial intervention

19:44.776 --> 19:48.277
wiping out early humans
and starting over.

19:50.000 --> 19:50.500
_

19:52.391 --> 19:57.561
Sima de las Palomas, Spain. 2011.

19:57.596 --> 20:01.164
Archaeologists unearth
a prehistoric grave

20:01.200 --> 20:03.166
containing three individuals

20:03.202 --> 20:06.269
buried side-by-side
with their arms folded

20:06.305 --> 20:08.772
in a ritualistic fashion.

20:08.807 --> 20:11.508
Because of the manner of their burial,

20:11.543 --> 20:15.011
the archaeologists
assume the remains are human,

20:15.047 --> 20:18.081
but are surprised to discover
that they are actually

20:18.117 --> 20:21.818
our evolutionary cousin, Neanderthal.

20:26.058 --> 20:29.726
It takes a good deal of
imagination to prepare the dead.

20:29.762 --> 20:33.296
It suggests some kind of
notion of an afterlife.

20:33.332 --> 20:35.399
If there is that,

20:35.434 --> 20:39.002
there is usually a notion
of a deity of some kind.

20:39.037 --> 20:41.204
That is fairly complicated
religious thinking,

20:41.240 --> 20:44.775
suggesting that the
Neanderthals had a capacity

20:44.810 --> 20:48.278
for symbolic reasoning
and the formation of culture.

20:48.313 --> 20:51.348
This suggests a level of civilization,

20:51.383 --> 20:54.684
or at least the proto-culture,

20:54.720 --> 20:58.922
that is further along
than we used to think.

20:58.957 --> 21:02.159
Neanderthals, unfortunately,
because of early discoveries

21:02.194 --> 21:04.995
that made them look
like a brutish caveman,

21:05.030 --> 21:07.998
not intelligent, that they're
very, very different from us.

21:08.033 --> 21:12.002
They were shorter and stockier,
but they had huge brains.

21:12.037 --> 21:14.237
They clearly had clothing.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.373
They cared for their sick and elderly.

21:16.408 --> 21:18.742
They were very intelligent.

21:22.448 --> 21:24.414
In 2014,

21:24.450 --> 21:26.583
scientists analyzed materials

21:26.618 --> 21:28.852
from 40 different archaeological sites

21:28.887 --> 21:31.721
to determine a reliable extinction date

21:31.757 --> 21:33.790
for Neanderthals.

21:33.826 --> 21:38.094
The date they came up with
is 40,000 years ago,

21:38.130 --> 21:41.865
suggesting they coexisted
with Homo sapiens

21:41.900 --> 21:45.068
for at least 1,000 years.

21:45.103 --> 21:48.772
But just why did they die off?

21:51.977 --> 21:54.444
At this point,
we don't know exactly why

21:54.480 --> 21:56.780
these other species died off.

21:56.815 --> 22:00.350
Certainly, it does broadly coincide with

22:00.385 --> 22:04.120
the expansion of
anatomically modern humans

22:04.156 --> 22:06.223
to all parts of the globe.

22:06.258 --> 22:09.359
But contrary to our
notions from the past,

22:09.394 --> 22:13.763
it doesn't look like it was
a lack of intelligence

22:13.799 --> 22:17.801
that led to the demise of Neanderthals.

22:20.906 --> 22:23.773
Although Neanderthals are long extinct,

22:23.809 --> 22:28.478
in 2013, evolutionary
geneticists discovered

22:28.514 --> 22:30.347
select modern human populations

22:30.382 --> 22:34.551
carry genomes from both
Neanderthal and Denisovans,

22:34.586 --> 22:39.055
suggesting that, at some point,
interbreeding occurred.

22:39.091 --> 22:43.827
Neanderthal genetic markers
are concentrated in populations

22:43.862 --> 22:47.464
in Europe and parts of the Middle East.

22:47.499 --> 22:49.566
Denisovan markers can be found

22:49.601 --> 22:51.868
in the mainland Asian populations,

22:51.904 --> 22:54.804
as well as Pacific Islander,
New Guineans

22:54.840 --> 22:57.240
and Australian Aborigines.

22:59.244 --> 23:02.379
According to some
ancient astronaut theorists,

23:02.414 --> 23:05.949
this interbreeding may be
the key to understanding

23:05.984 --> 23:09.119
the demise of the other
intelligent hominin species

23:09.154 --> 23:12.522
that once shared the planet with humans.

23:15.193 --> 23:19.396
Consider the possibility that
these different hominid strains

23:19.431 --> 23:21.031
were meant to be kept

23:21.066 --> 23:24.467
geologically separated from each other,

23:24.503 --> 23:28.405
across tracts of land that
were considered to be too vast

23:28.440 --> 23:31.575
for them to ultimately come
into contact with one another.

23:31.610 --> 23:35.979
Is it possible that
interbreeding was frowned upon,

23:36.014 --> 23:37.547
and that once interbreeding
with Neanderthals started

23:37.583 --> 23:39.282
to take place,

23:39.318 --> 23:42.586
it was damaging the very
essence of the experiment?

23:42.621 --> 23:44.554
And because of that,
the Neanderthal strain

23:44.590 --> 23:47.924
had to be terminated
or removed from the planet

23:47.960 --> 23:49.859
to stop this from happening.

23:49.895 --> 23:52.996
When we look at ancient texts,

23:53.031 --> 23:55.899
particularly religious texts,
from millennia ago,

23:55.934 --> 24:00.971
what we find is the idea
of the gods or a god

24:01.006 --> 24:03.573
wanting to create a human that was pure,

24:03.609 --> 24:06.343
sort of physically and morally.

24:06.378 --> 24:08.511
What we also find

24:08.547 --> 24:12.248
are accounts where the wrath
of God or the wrath of the gods

24:12.284 --> 24:15.018
hammered down on us

24:15.053 --> 24:19.022
for essentially going
off the rails, so to speak.

24:19.057 --> 24:23.193
And we could make a case
that this was some example

24:23.228 --> 24:27.597
of extraterrestrial intervention
to essentially try

24:27.633 --> 24:30.600
and purify again the species,

24:30.636 --> 24:34.337
and that might have involved
wiping out significant portions

24:34.373 --> 24:37.440
of early humans and starting over.

24:40.345 --> 24:43.580
It's very possible
that the aliens decided

24:43.615 --> 24:46.416
that in order to cleanse the planet,

24:46.451 --> 24:49.753
they needed to do things
of huge magnitude,

24:49.788 --> 24:52.922
like the flood that
the Bible talks about.

24:55.661 --> 24:58.995
The flood was geared to
primarily eradicating the people

24:59.031 --> 25:01.064
that were on the planet at that time.

25:01.099 --> 25:04.034
Well, God could have been
the extraterrestrials,

25:04.069 --> 25:06.202
could have created that somehow.

25:06.238 --> 25:08.038
It's very possible and very likely

25:08.073 --> 25:11.508
that in order to eradicate a species

25:11.543 --> 25:13.243
that they may have genetically
altered themselves

25:13.278 --> 25:14.911
and screwed up with,

25:14.946 --> 25:17.947
that they needed to get rid of
them and start all over again.

25:23.221 --> 25:25.855
Did extraterrestrials eradicate

25:25.891 --> 25:27.957
various prehuman species

25:27.993 --> 25:32.362
in an attempt to keep
the human genetic line clean?

25:32.397 --> 25:35.932
Could the evolutionary
bottlenecks in our prehistory

25:35.967 --> 25:38.568
support this theory?

25:38.603 --> 25:41.471
And just as evidence of interbreeding

25:41.506 --> 25:43.773
exists in our genetic signature,

25:43.809 --> 25:47.977
might there also have been
unintended survivors?

25:51.917 --> 25:53.883
There is no connection

25:53.919 --> 25:55.685
between these two groups.
We couldn't understand

25:55.721 --> 25:58.121
why they're so different,
these X haplogroups.

25:58.156 --> 26:00.423
You have people
indigenous to this planet,

26:00.459 --> 26:03.727
and you really can't trace
what their ancestry was.

26:05.500 --> 26:06.000
_

26:07.865 --> 26:09.499
Emory University.

26:10.534 --> 26:13.203
Atlanta, Georgia. 1998.

26:15.207 --> 26:17.574
Researchers analyze DNA data

26:17.609 --> 26:20.810
collected from various
Native American populations,

26:20.846 --> 26:24.147
in an effort to trace back
their ancestral descent

26:24.182 --> 26:26.983
through the Bering Strait.

26:27.018 --> 26:30.854
The lineages are categorized
into four haplogroups:

26:30.889 --> 26:34.491
A, B, C or D.

26:34.526 --> 26:37.761
Each line representing
a different migration

26:37.796 --> 26:39.262
off the Asian continent

26:39.297 --> 26:42.232
between 20,000 to 30,000 years ago.

26:44.035 --> 26:45.602
But what they also find

26:45.637 --> 26:48.805
is that a small portion
of the Native population

26:48.840 --> 26:53.109
falls completely outside any
previously known genetic group.

26:53.145 --> 26:57.614
They can trace the ancestry
back 36,000 years,

26:57.649 --> 26:59.816
but not to the Bering Strait.

26:59.851 --> 27:05.855
Scientists dub it the X lineage.

27:05.891 --> 27:08.591
Among human haplogroups, one stands out:

27:08.627 --> 27:10.360
the X lineage, which is found

27:10.395 --> 27:13.797
in about 2.5 percent of some
Native American groups,

27:13.832 --> 27:15.732
and also in a small population

27:15.767 --> 27:19.736
of northern Europeans
and the Middle East.

27:19.771 --> 27:22.672
And there is no connection
between these groups.

27:22.707 --> 27:24.574
We couldn't understand
why they're so different,

27:24.609 --> 27:26.342
these X haplogroups.

27:26.378 --> 27:30.013
Isn't it amazing that
you have a group of people

27:30.048 --> 27:32.882
indigenous, we think, to this planet

27:32.918 --> 27:37.120
and you really can't trace
what their ancestry was?

27:37.155 --> 27:39.689
Scientists throw up their hands
and they simply say,

27:39.724 --> 27:43.092
"I don't know how this can be,
because these people

27:43.128 --> 27:45.862
"aren't somehow related to these people.

27:45.897 --> 27:47.630
How can this be?"

27:49.234 --> 27:51.234
While the source of this X lineage

27:51.269 --> 27:55.038
remains a mystery, some ancient
astronaut theorists believe

27:55.073 --> 27:58.908
it might be connected
to a lost race of people

27:58.944 --> 28:02.212
that were said to have existed
throughout the world,

28:02.247 --> 28:06.082
including North America.

28:06.117 --> 28:09.752
It's possible that this X lineage gene

28:09.788 --> 28:13.556
is related to the giants

28:13.592 --> 28:17.026
that were reported throughout the world.

28:17.062 --> 28:20.864
Starting in the mid-1800s,

28:20.899 --> 28:24.801
in America,
archaeologists began excavating

28:24.836 --> 28:26.736
skeletons of giants who were

28:26.771 --> 28:30.273
seven to eight feet tall in many cases.

28:34.346 --> 28:36.713
In the 1800s,

28:36.748 --> 28:39.749
Smithsonian archaeologists
unearthed dozens

28:39.784 --> 28:42.919
of oversized skeletons contained
within the burial mounds

28:42.954 --> 28:46.322
of the ancient Adena Indian tribe.

28:46.358 --> 28:49.759
The highest concentration of which

28:49.794 --> 28:53.263
were found in the Kanawha Valley
of West Virginia,

28:53.298 --> 28:59.469
an area known to researchers
as the valley of the giants.

28:59.504 --> 29:02.405
Author and researcher William Henry

29:02.440 --> 29:05.642
is meeting up with a local
Adena Indian researcher,

29:05.677 --> 29:07.777
Jason Jarrell, to have a look

29:07.812 --> 29:10.947
at one of these ancient earthworks.

29:10.982 --> 29:14.350
This is the Criel Mound,
and this mound was excavated

29:14.386 --> 29:16.185
by the Smithsonian Institution

29:16.221 --> 29:18.554
in November of 1883.

29:18.590 --> 29:21.391
The Smithsonian sank a circular shaft

29:21.426 --> 29:23.126
from the top of this mound

29:23.161 --> 29:25.962
down through the center
to the bottom. Wow.

29:25.997 --> 29:30.667
And that's where they
found an elaborate tomb.

29:30.702 --> 29:33.269
This structure contained 11 burials.

29:33.305 --> 29:35.505
Ten of these burials were arranged

29:35.540 --> 29:39.275
in a semi-circular fashion
around a central personage.

29:39.311 --> 29:41.311
So you have ten people
around a central figure.

29:41.346 --> 29:43.680
What was significant
about this central figure?

29:43.715 --> 29:45.415
According to A.R. Sines, who assisted

29:45.450 --> 29:47.483
in the excavation of this mound,

29:47.519 --> 29:50.753
the central burial,
when measured in the tomb,

29:50.789 --> 29:53.957
was six-foot-eight and three quarters.

29:53.992 --> 29:56.993
Now, the skull had been
pulverized by the excavation,

29:57.028 --> 29:59.429
so a complete measurement
wasn't possible.

29:59.464 --> 30:01.864
So, in all likelihood, this individual

30:01.900 --> 30:04.100
was probably around seven feet tall.

30:04.135 --> 30:05.435
That's a giant.

30:05.470 --> 30:07.437
It's a gigantic humanoid.

30:07.472 --> 30:10.273
So we're saying the Smithsonian

30:10.308 --> 30:12.308
came here in 1883

30:12.344 --> 30:15.178
and discovered a giant?

30:15.213 --> 30:17.814
That's correct.
In fact, they discovered giants

30:17.849 --> 30:20.016
in many of the mounds
here in Charleston.

30:20.051 --> 30:21.918
There were originally 50 burial mounds

30:21.953 --> 30:23.987
-in this valley.
-Wow.

30:24.022 --> 30:26.389
And I've actually got some
documentation here to show you.

30:26.424 --> 30:29.525
-Let's see.
-This is the manuscript

30:29.561 --> 30:33.463
of the agent of the Smithsonian
who excavated these mounds.

30:33.498 --> 30:35.965
And this represents
his day-to-day journal

30:36.001 --> 30:38.868
of his excavations, including
the one that's mentioned

30:38.903 --> 30:41.037
on this page, which is measured as

30:41.072 --> 30:42.305
seven foot, six inches in length.

30:42.340 --> 30:44.107
Incredible.

30:44.142 --> 30:46.442
So wait a minute,
this is a government worker...

30:46.478 --> 30:48.511
-Correct. Correct.
-...who's out doing a job,

30:48.546 --> 30:52.015
excavating a mound,
and he discovers giants?

30:52.050 --> 30:54.217
Multiple gigantic skeletons.

30:54.252 --> 30:55.551
The ones in this valley

30:55.587 --> 30:57.920
being between seven and eight feet tall.

30:57.956 --> 31:00.456
That is incredible. So why
don't we all know about it?

31:00.492 --> 31:01.891
How come it's not in history books?

31:01.926 --> 31:04.961
Well, the policy of denial
of the discovery

31:04.996 --> 31:07.196
of gigantic human skeletons actually

31:07.232 --> 31:09.799
wasn't enacted until about 1920.

31:09.834 --> 31:12.502
Uh, before that time period,
the Smithsonian

31:12.537 --> 31:14.837
acknowledged these giants
in their own reports.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.639
Absolutely amazing.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.877
For years, I've been hearing stories,

31:20.912 --> 31:23.012
Native American legends about giants.

31:23.048 --> 31:25.214
It appears that we've
unearthed evidence,

31:25.250 --> 31:28.518
proof of their existence,
here in West Virginia.

31:28.553 --> 31:31.187
But, for whatever reason,
that proof was suppressed.

31:31.222 --> 31:33.189
It probably has to do with the fact that

31:33.224 --> 31:36.526
it doesn't fit with our
model of human evolution.

31:36.561 --> 31:38.361
We have to ask:

31:38.396 --> 31:41.064
Is there an extraterrestrial connection?

31:41.099 --> 31:44.333
You have these Biblical
stories of the watchers

31:44.369 --> 31:46.302
and the sons of God

31:46.337 --> 31:49.005
coming to Earth, breeding with humans

31:49.040 --> 31:52.075
to create this new race of giants,

31:52.110 --> 31:54.343
the Nephilim.

31:54.379 --> 31:56.679
These giant skeletons

31:56.714 --> 31:59.282
seem to be evidence of-of the watchers

31:59.317 --> 32:01.017
and the Nephilim.

32:01.052 --> 32:03.186
We have to ask ourselves

32:03.221 --> 32:07.123
who these seven, eight-foot giants were.

32:07.158 --> 32:11.961
Were they somehow the vestiges
of these giants of the Bible?

32:11.996 --> 32:15.531
It's a mystery that
archeologists have yet to solve.

32:15.567 --> 32:20.136
And part of the answer
may be extraterrestrial DNA

32:20.171 --> 32:22.205
that's part of these giants.

32:25.376 --> 32:27.710
Is it possible that the remains

32:27.745 --> 32:30.713
of a giant-sized population
were discovered

32:30.748 --> 32:35.051
on the North American continent
over 100 years ago?

32:35.086 --> 32:38.354
If so, were these beings a variation

32:38.389 --> 32:40.590
of Homo sapiens,

32:40.625 --> 32:43.659
an ancient intelligent hominin,

32:43.695 --> 32:47.530
or an otherworldly species altogether?

32:47.565 --> 32:50.399
Perhaps further clues can be found

32:50.435 --> 32:52.935
by examining the rarest

32:52.971 --> 32:56.439
and most mysterious
human blood type on Earth.

33:00.044 --> 33:03.379
Rh-negative people may have been evolved

33:03.414 --> 33:05.882
from a different kind of species.

33:05.917 --> 33:07.717
There is a danger

33:07.752 --> 33:10.987
because these two blood types
can't interbreed.

33:13.500 --> 33:14.000
_

33:16.569 --> 33:20.171
Located between the
border of Spain and France

33:20.206 --> 33:23.574
is the Pyrenees Mountain Range.

33:23.609 --> 33:27.244
The people that occupy this
isolated region are known

33:27.280 --> 33:29.280
as the Basque,

33:29.315 --> 33:33.451
and they have long confounded
anthropologists and historians.

33:35.488 --> 33:38.889
The language spoken by
the enclave is not related

33:38.925 --> 33:43.094
to any other in that part of the world.

33:43.129 --> 33:46.497
And the population also has
the highest concentration

33:46.532 --> 33:50.101
of Rh-negative blood type in the world.

33:53.072 --> 33:57.641
Up to 35% of Basque people
have Rh-negative blood.

33:57.677 --> 34:03.314
And Rh-negative blood is one
of the most unusual blood types.

34:03.349 --> 34:07.318
And it's the one blood type
that is least likely

34:07.353 --> 34:11.989
to mutate or interact
with other blood types.

34:13.726 --> 34:16.226
Human blood types are grouped

34:16.262 --> 34:22.399
into four distinct designations
that include O, A, B and AB.

34:22.435 --> 34:25.969
Additionally, there is another
variance between blood types

34:26.005 --> 34:30.440
known as the Rh-factor,
or Rhesus factor,

34:30.476 --> 34:32.176
which is a measure

34:32.210 --> 34:35.279
of Rhesus-based antigens in the blood.

34:35.313 --> 34:37.481
The name comes from a monkey from India

34:37.516 --> 34:40.284
and other parts of Asia,
which is the rhesus macaque.

34:40.319 --> 34:43.654
And this monkey was used in experiments,

34:43.688 --> 34:45.121
looking at blood transfusions.

34:45.158 --> 34:49.293
How blood was received
from recipients varied.

34:49.328 --> 34:52.096
And it was discovered that

34:52.130 --> 34:55.399
the Rhesus factor could be
positive or negative.

34:55.434 --> 34:58.435
Most humans in the world
are Rhesus positive.

35:03.709 --> 35:07.812
85% of humans in the
world are Rh-positive

35:07.847 --> 35:10.047
and have no issues receiving blood

35:10.082 --> 35:12.683
from positive or negative donors.

35:14.754 --> 35:17.288
But for the Rh-negative population,

35:17.323 --> 35:22.193
receiving Rh-positive
blood may be fatal,

35:22.228 --> 35:26.864
as the body will try to
destroy the foreign antigens.

35:26.899 --> 35:29.834
And for women that are Rh-negative,

35:29.869 --> 35:32.436
mating with a Rh-positive partner

35:32.471 --> 35:35.539
could be detrimental to the fetus.

35:40.379 --> 35:44.281
If a Rhesus positive and
a Rhesus negative parents

35:44.317 --> 35:45.850
were to have an offspring,

35:45.885 --> 35:49.320
there is a potential danger
to the offspring,

35:49.355 --> 35:52.523
because these two blood types
can't interbreed, basically.

35:52.558 --> 35:54.725
Medical intervention is needed.

35:54.760 --> 35:57.528
It's why actually, in the past,
people had to have a blood test

35:57.563 --> 35:59.797
before they were allowed to get married.

35:59.832 --> 36:03.400
The very fact that
an Rh-negative mother,

36:03.436 --> 36:08.272
her body would actually try
to kill an Rh-positive baby

36:08.307 --> 36:11.208
generates bizarre scenarios.

36:11.244 --> 36:13.544
How on earth could this happen?

36:13.579 --> 36:15.613
It suggests somewhere in our lineage

36:15.648 --> 36:19.750
that the Rh-negatives and
the Rh-positives are perceived

36:19.785 --> 36:21.585
as being profoundly different.

36:21.621 --> 36:25.756
And also, studies of
Rh-negatives suggest that

36:25.791 --> 36:28.459
they have lower than
normal blood pressure,

36:28.494 --> 36:30.361
lower than normal pulse.

36:30.396 --> 36:31.829
In a number of cases,

36:31.864 --> 36:34.431
they have an extra
vertebra in their back.

36:36.636 --> 36:39.403
Rh-negative is very rare.

36:39.438 --> 36:41.338
Most of the world didn't have it

36:41.374 --> 36:44.942
until colonization started
in the 15th century.

36:44.977 --> 36:48.045
Rh-negative didn't exist
in the Americas,

36:48.080 --> 36:49.613
and it didn't exist in southern Africa,

36:49.649 --> 36:51.282
it didn't exist in Asia.

36:51.317 --> 36:54.852
It was only in Europe,
so it spread out from there.

36:54.887 --> 36:58.689
Out of Africa, that theory has it

36:58.724 --> 37:01.792
that all human beings
originated in Africa,

37:01.827 --> 37:03.594
southern Africa, sub Sahara.

37:03.629 --> 37:06.096
They're all Rh-positive.

37:06.132 --> 37:07.865
They don't have any Rh-negative.

37:07.900 --> 37:10.200
Where did Rh-negative evolve, then?

37:10.236 --> 37:14.772
15% of the humans have
Rh-negative blood.

37:14.807 --> 37:16.774
Fifteen percent.

37:16.809 --> 37:20.644
And scientists have no idea
where it came from.

37:20.680 --> 37:23.781
What they do believe
is that if you have that,

37:23.816 --> 37:25.916
you may have been evolved

37:25.952 --> 37:28.919
from a different kind of
species on this planet.

37:28.955 --> 37:34.158
Now was that species put here,
genetically altered?

37:34.193 --> 37:36.961
Or was it just a natural formation

37:36.996 --> 37:40.331
of the planet in its evolutionary stage?

37:40.366 --> 37:44.234
Who knows? But the fact is
that Rh-negative people--

37:44.270 --> 37:47.171
and again, there's 15%
of them on this planet--

37:47.206 --> 37:50.207
may have come from outside sources.

37:52.545 --> 37:55.379
Could the Rh-negative blood type

37:55.414 --> 37:59.283
offer evidence of a vastly
different prehuman evolution

37:59.318 --> 38:02.453
than what we are led to believe
in our history books?

38:02.488 --> 38:05.322
Might it offer indisputable proof

38:05.358 --> 38:09.660
of extraterrestrial intervention
in the remote past?

38:09.695 --> 38:12.863
But if so, is the experimentation

38:12.898 --> 38:15.199
with intelligent hominin over,

38:15.234 --> 38:18.402
or is it still taking place?

38:20.500 --> 38:21.000
_

38:25.986 --> 38:27.820
A decade and a half

38:27.855 --> 38:30.522
after Dr. David Jacobs wrote his book

38:30.558 --> 38:33.559
proposing that aliens are
experimenting on humans,

38:33.594 --> 38:38.831
anthropologist Dr. John Hawkes
publishes research suggesting

38:38.866 --> 38:42.034
that humans have
inexplicably experienced

38:42.069 --> 38:45.237
an accelerated evolution
in recent history.

38:50.544 --> 38:52.678
Humanity entered into

38:52.713 --> 38:55.714
a supercharged period of evolution.

38:55.750 --> 39:01.386
If you look at DNA from a human
walking around in 3,000 B.C.,

39:01.422 --> 39:03.889
and you compare it
to what we have today,

39:03.924 --> 39:06.892
it is seven percent different.

39:06.927 --> 39:08.894
What is this telling us?

39:08.929 --> 39:11.296
It could be that
extraterrestrials are involved

39:11.332 --> 39:15.267
in that process, shepherding our
genetic change through contact,

39:15.302 --> 39:18.904
through genetic work
that they are doing.

39:20.908 --> 39:24.576
Millions of people
report being abducted.

39:24.612 --> 39:26.145
They can't all be wrong.

39:26.180 --> 39:28.514
Something is happening to these people.

39:28.549 --> 39:31.283
And if you assume for a moment

39:31.318 --> 39:34.386
that we may be the
test tube of the universe,

39:34.421 --> 39:36.355
where they experiment

39:36.390 --> 39:39.324
and genetically manipulate
and change things,

39:39.360 --> 39:43.595
it's very possible that
the experiment continues.

39:43.631 --> 39:46.498
Young children are changing.

39:46.534 --> 39:48.767
They're smarter, they're more mature,

39:48.803 --> 39:50.869
they're growing up much faster

39:50.905 --> 39:53.372
than we did when we were children.

39:53.407 --> 39:55.808
What will it be like 50 years from now

39:55.843 --> 39:59.444
or a 100 years from now
is anybody's guess.

39:59.480 --> 40:02.114
Could it be--

40:02.149 --> 40:04.516
as ancient astronaut theorists suggest--

40:04.552 --> 40:08.654
that evolution is not just
the result of natural selection,

40:08.689 --> 40:12.124
but also alien manipulation?

40:14.161 --> 40:16.795
And that humans are quickly becoming

40:16.831 --> 40:18.864
an entirely new species,

40:18.899 --> 40:22.334
designed to replace Homo sapiens?

40:28.509 --> 40:31.810
What we will begin to see
in the coming decades

40:31.846 --> 40:35.447
is the fulfillment of a plan
by extraterrestrials

40:35.482 --> 40:39.751
to ultimately transform humans
into celestial beings.

40:39.787 --> 40:43.522
The ultimate goal is
to make us better suited

40:43.557 --> 40:47.960
for traveling in space
and the return to the stars.

40:47.995 --> 40:51.496
Are we now being replaced

40:51.532 --> 40:57.169
by a brand-new hybridized species?

40:59.073 --> 41:01.907
One of the things that
I think about often now:

41:01.942 --> 41:05.677
Neanderthals never knew

41:05.713 --> 41:09.348
they were going to be
replaced by Homo sapiens.

41:12.620 --> 41:14.353
Is mankind the result

41:14.388 --> 41:17.556
of an extraterrestrial experiment?

41:17.591 --> 41:22.527
Could isolated regions of Earth
have served as laboratories

41:22.563 --> 41:27.366
until the time when one species
was chosen to continue?

41:27.401 --> 41:30.535
And might this genetic manipulation

41:30.571 --> 41:34.640
still be ongoing even to this day?

41:34.675 --> 41:37.309
Perhaps it will soon be revealed

41:37.344 --> 41:40.979
that we, too, are experimental humans,

41:41.015 --> 41:44.416
serving as the latest link in the chain

41:44.451 --> 41:47.019
of a directed evolution,

41:47.054 --> 41:49.488
and being prepared for a future

41:49.523 --> 41:53.725
alongside our alien ancestors.
