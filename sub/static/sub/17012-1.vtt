Ruth. Hey, Ruth.

00:51.656 --> 00:53.589
Where are you going? Home.

00:53.591 --> 00:55.391
Home's the other way. Not mine.

00:55.393 --> 00:58.127
Are you going back
to your mom's?

00:58.129 --> 01:02.031
It's a 15-mile walk.
I know how far it is.

01:02.033 --> 01:03.933
All right. Well, then,
I'll just walk with you.

01:03.935 --> 01:06.068
You do whatever you want.
What I want to do is take you

01:06.070 --> 01:07.736
back to our house.
Why did you tell Freddy you

01:07.738 --> 01:09.672
were gonna strike out
on your own?

01:09.674 --> 01:12.608
I don't think I said that, but

01:12.610 --> 01:15.411
if I did, when I say, "on my
own," I mean you and me.

01:15.413 --> 01:19.114
I always mean you and me.

01:19.116 --> 01:25.621
Hey. You gonna leave me?

01:25.623 --> 01:27.856
No, I'm not gonna leave you.
Nobody's leaving any...

01:27.858 --> 01:30.025
'cause I will leave you first.

01:30.027 --> 01:34.630
It's not... Funny.

I'm not gonna leave you.
You're not gonna leave me.

Because if you do, I'll just
follow you.

Not going to jail.

And that shack ain't a home.
Well, I'm working on it.

01:59.290 --> 02:05.728
And I think I'm gonna have a

to do, is sing songs.
Just talk.

You come after me.
That's how it's gonna be.

No. We can make it.
We can make it if we run.

We can't make it, Ruth.
Yeah, we can.

And Bob.
Only Bob don't got a choice.

I'm confused, Ruth.
I took you kids in, raised you

07:48.372 --> 07:52.808
and Bob like you were my own.
How do you go and do a thing

07:52.810 --> 07:57.546
like this?
We were just doing what you

07:57.548 --> 08:04.786
taught us to do.
Is that a boy or a girl?

08:04.788 --> 08:12.327
Do you know yet? I don't know.

08:12.329 --> 08:17.065
So, what do you want to do,
Ruth?

08:17.067 --> 08:24.473
I'm gonna wait for him.
Dear Ruth...

08:24.475 --> 08:27.542
I dreamed about you again last
night.

08:27.544 --> 08:33.315
I guess I dream about you every
night... and most days, too.

08:33.317 --> 08:37.519
I hold your face in my mind.
I put your voice together in my

08:37.520 --> 08:40.054
head. I think about your hair

08:40.057 --> 08:42.491
getting longer.
I think about your belly

08:42.493 --> 08:46.094
getting bigger.
I hear people talk about regret,

08:46.096 --> 08:49.731
but I haven't got any.
I don't think poorly on the

08:49.733 --> 08:53.802

We did what we did, and that is

08:53.804 --> 08:56.271
who we are.

sentence before you get to read
it, but I know you know what it

08:59.076 --> 09:02.144
says.
Every day, I wake up thinking

09:02.146 --> 09:05.647
today's the day I'm gonna see
you, and one of these days, it

09:05.649 --> 09:08.150
will be so.
And until then, I'll keep

09:08.152 --> 09:10.852
writing you.
I'll write you every day.

09:10.854 --> 09:14.356
And someday you'll get a letter
from me, and you will look up,

09:14.358 --> 09:18.226
and it'll be me who's handing it
to you.

09:18.228 --> 09:20.896
And then we can forget about
words, and I'll touch your face

09:20.898 --> 09:24.132
and I'll kiss you.

13:29.546 --> 13:32.847
What'd you find? Kitties!

13:32.849 --> 13:35.650
Where did these come from?
I don't know.

13:35.652 --> 13:38.119
How many are you?

13:38.121 --> 13:42.357
You're just a tiny little thing.
Aren't you tiny?

13:42.359 --> 13:45.427
Where's your mama at?

13:45.429 --> 13:47.462
What are you crying for? Huh?

13:47.464 --> 13:50.799
Maybe he wants me. What?

13:50.801 --> 13:54.436
Maybe he wants me.
Maybe he does.

13:54.438 --> 13:57.105
But you still have two more
bites.

13:57.107 --> 14:00.175
"And the little horse ran and"

14:00.177 --> 14:04.045
ran, and foxes chased him, and
he could hear them barking.

14:04.047 --> 14:07.849
And the wolves ran after him,
and he could hear them howling,

14:07.851 --> 14:10.185
"but he knew they couldn't
catch him."

14:10.187 --> 14:13.088
Bear.
Yeah, there's that baby bear.

14:13.090 --> 14:15.590
Your daddy loves bears.
He used to wrestle with them.

14:15.592 --> 14:18.727
He'd tackle them down.
He'd bop them on the nose.

14:25.769 --> 14:33.769
Sylvie, put your shoes on.

14:53.230 --> 14:57.432
Okay.

14:57.434 --> 15:04.139
Hey. Morning, miss Guthrie.

15:04.141 --> 15:07.642
I was hoping to catch you
before work.

15:07.644 --> 15:10.779
Is something wrong?
I was hoping for a word.

15:10.781 --> 15:13.248
How many cats you got? Four.

15:13.250 --> 15:17.218
Yeah? What's this one's name?
Willow.

15:17.220 --> 15:22.223
He looks like a Jimmy to me.

15:22.225 --> 15:26.261
How'd you get those cats?

15:26.263 --> 15:29.130
Get down. Found them out back.

15:29.132 --> 15:33.034
Oh, thank you.
Mama was long gone, I guess.

15:33.036 --> 15:36.704
Well, you need someone to
take a few of them off your

15:36.706 --> 15:38.540
hands?
I can handle some kittens, at

15:38.542 --> 15:42.510
least.

15:42.512 --> 15:49.250
Like I said, uh...
They're setting to get ready to

15:49.252 --> 15:55.156
call you down to the station,
and, uh, it's gonna be all over

15:55.158 --> 15:58.860
the news later.
Thought best if you hear this

15:58.862 --> 16:03.031
from a friend. Hear what?

16:05.969 --> 16:13.969
Bob tried to escape five
times already.

16:18.882 --> 16:23.218
Did you know that? No, sir.

16:23.220 --> 16:25.920
Well, maybe six times is the
charm.

16:25.922 --> 16:30.058
The boys he broke free with got
caught trying to hop a train up

16:30.060 --> 16:34.529
near bartlesville, heading
north.

16:34.531 --> 16:42.337
Maybe Bob's doing likewise.
Maybe he's already long gone.

16:42.339 --> 16:45.907
Maybe. What do you think?

16:45.909 --> 16:50.712
I don't know.
Anybody asking about him...

16:50.714 --> 16:55.150
anybody at all? Nope.

16:55.152 --> 17:00.355
What about those letters?
Everyone read them before

17:00.357 --> 17:03.791
they even got sent.
They don't say anything.

17:03.793 --> 17:06.861
You want to just bring them
in anyway?

17:06.863 --> 17:10.999
I'll do whatever you want,
but he won't come back.

17:11.001 --> 17:15.236
He's not coming back for me if
that's what you're thinking.

17:15.238 --> 17:15.738
Ruth!

17:26.616 --> 17:34.616
Did she tell you anything?
Did she tell you anything?

17:40.363 --> 17:42.864
No, gene.
She didn't say a damn thing.

17:42.866 --> 17:45.733
I'm surprised.
I thought she'd like you better

17:45.735 --> 17:49.237
than me.
Let me have this one, huh?

17:49.239 --> 17:51.339
Well, hell, pat.
You're the one he shot.

17:51.341 --> 17:53.608
I'm gonna let you catch the son
of a bitch.

17:53.610 --> 17:56.844
Yep. Sorry I'm late.

17:56.846 --> 18:00.248
She had to have a time-out.
She got in a fight with Miles.

18:00.250 --> 18:03.651
Why did you get into a fight
with those boys?

18:03.653 --> 18:06.721
They called me names.
You need to have a better

18:06.723 --> 18:08.723
reason than that.

18:08.725 --> 18:16.725

Well, you got your birthday list
put together yet?

You better get on that.
Get your mama to help you.

18:47.464 --> 18:53.167
I heard the news.
Anything you want to talk about?

18:53.169 --> 18:56.137
Everyone thinks I got
something to tell them.

18:56.139 --> 19:02.277
I don't have a goddamn thing.
They say they traced him to

You think he's in Montana?

see what I can do about putting

24:47.757 --> 24:51.325
I said, "I'm gonna just walk
right out the door."

24:51.327 --> 24:54.695
And he said they'd stop me.
And I said, "no, sir."

24:54.697 --> 24:58.799
I've got better things to do."
And he said, "well, that's not

24:58.801 --> 25:01.769
how it works."
And I said, "well, it only works

25:01.771 --> 25:04.205
that way 'cause you think it has
to.

25:04.207 --> 25:08.342
See, I've got a higher calling.
I've got a wife and a little

25:08.344 --> 25:13.814
girl who needs her daddy."
And he asked me what I know

25:13.816 --> 25:16.250
about higher callings... says
even if I do get out, I'm gonna

25:16.252 --> 25:21.255
have to answer to God and the
devil for the things I done.

25:21.257 --> 25:26.594
I tell him... Shoot.

25:26.596 --> 25:33.601
I tell him...
I tell him, "sir..."

25:33.603 --> 25:39.140
I used to be the devil.
Now I'm just a man."

25:39.142 --> 25:44.311
As the days tick by...
10, 9, 8...

25:44.313 --> 25:52.313
and on the last day...
The bars open up, and I walk

25:52.855 --> 25:57.725
right out.
News says you jumped off a

25:57.727 --> 26:05.727
work truck. Yeah.

26:06.235 --> 26:13.140
Well...

26:15.144 --> 26:23.144
Man, have you got anything to
eat?

26:23.786 --> 26:27.922
I'm still a little bit hungry.

26:27.924 --> 26:33.494
Well, I'll find something.

26:33.496 --> 26:40.134
Have you seen Ruth lately?
Nope. It's been a while.

26:40.136 --> 26:46.207
She don't live with her mama no
more.

26:46.209 --> 26:50.377
Got a new house. A new house?

26:50.379 --> 26:53.948
Mm-hmm. Skerritt's been
looking after her.

26:53.950 --> 26:57.818
He got her all set up.
Guess I should tell you got a

26:57.820 --> 27:01.355
call the other day asking about
you.

27:01.357 --> 27:03.524
Oh, yeah? What'd you tell 'em?

27:03.526 --> 27:07.194
I told them I hadn't seen
you, which I hadn't.

27:07.196 --> 27:10.364
Didn't think I'd be seeing you

27:10.366 --> 27:12.533
so soon. That's the truth.

29:38.347 --> 29:46.347
I guess that's about... that's
about what I owe you.

29:55.131 --> 29:58.399
Where'd this come from?

29:58.401 --> 30:03.137
All over. Whose is it?

30:03.139 --> 30:06.373
It's mine.

30:12.381 --> 30:17.384
Sounds like that wood's gone
soft.

30:17.386 --> 30:21.555
Yeah, I expect you're right.
More nails just won't hold it.

30:21.557 --> 30:24.358
The whole gutter just comes off
the house every time it rains

30:24.360 --> 30:26.126
like this.
You know, I go out there and

30:26.128 --> 30:28.195
nail it back up.
Next thing you know, it's back

30:28.197 --> 30:30.164
off.
Well, you can either do that

30:30.166 --> 30:32.166
or get more buckets.

30:32.168 --> 30:35.002
Yeah, I could do that.
That'd be easier in the

30:35.004 --> 30:37.371
short-term, for sure.
Then I'd have to haul that water

30:37.373 --> 30:39.139
out every time it rains.
I don't know.

30:39.141 --> 30:41.475
Howdy! Howdy to you.

30:43.179 --> 30:46.447
Yeah, all this rain we've
been having reminds me of that

30:46.449 --> 30:50.617
one march, it was.
We'd get 101/2 inches in a day.

30:50.619 --> 30:54.021
Man.
Oh, my middle tank out there has

30:54.023 --> 30:56.357
gone dry, and the other two...
say, can you tell me just

30:56.359 --> 31:00.828
what town we're in, exactly?
This is meridian.

31:00.830 --> 31:04.398
Okay. See, we passed through

31:04.400 --> 31:07.167
Glen rose, but we didn't see a
sign... didn't know if we'd gone

31:07.169 --> 31:10.504
too far, not far enough.
Well, that depends on where

31:10.506 --> 31:14.808
you're headed.
We're headed here.

31:14.810 --> 31:18.178
You, uh, plan to hunt some
deer?

31:18.180 --> 31:21.882
Thinking about it.
Anyway, it rained so much, it

31:21.884 --> 31:24.218
filled up them tanks, and my
wife walked up there to check

31:24.220 --> 31:26.653
'em the next day, and there was
catfish lyin' there.

31:26.655 --> 31:29.423
That thing filled up, and it was
spillin', and it had come out in

31:29.425 --> 31:30.657
the spill.

31:30.659 --> 31:33.160
Are these real? Come again?

31:33.162 --> 31:37.998
Are these real? You bet.

31:38.000 --> 31:42.603
How old are they?
Well, that pistol goes back

31:42.605 --> 31:46.240
125 years. You don't say.

31:46.242 --> 31:50.477
See that scrap of paper there

31:50.479 --> 31:53.914
next to it?

31:53.916 --> 31:59.586
That there is a list...
Of every poor son of a bitch who

31:59.588 --> 32:04.892
met his end at the barrel of it.

32:04.894 --> 32:08.162
Sounds like a bunch of
bullshit to me.

32:08.164 --> 32:14.468
Yeah, probably is.
Can I help you gentlemen find

32:14.470 --> 32:20.240
something in particular?
Nah. Just looking around.

32:22.411 --> 32:30.411
Is there any news?

32:37.526 --> 32:40.561
No, not today. Uh...

32:40.563 --> 32:48.563
Figured you want these back.
They're just gathering dust.

32:49.572 --> 32:52.639
You read 'em? No, ma'am.

32:52.641 --> 32:55.909
Why not? Everyone else has.

32:55.911 --> 32:59.012
They're not mine to read.

32:59.014 --> 33:07.014
Can I ask you something?
Mm, sure.

33:12.595 --> 33:15.095
Do you mean what you said
about Bob not coming back for

33:15.097 --> 33:21.034
you? Yeah, I did.

33:21.036 --> 33:24.738
Well, I was thinking maybe
you all'd want to get out of

33:24.740 --> 33:30.544
town until all this blows over.
You mean till he gets caught?

33:30.546 --> 33:37.751
Where would we go?
Someplace safe.

33:37.753 --> 33:44.158
Would you come?
Someone would come with you.

33:44.160 --> 33:52.160
I think I'll just stay here.
You know, I got to work, and

33:53.135 --> 33:56.203
sylvie's got her birthday.
We'll be just fine.

33:56.205 --> 33:58.639
Yeah, sure. She's gonna be 4.

33:58.641 --> 34:00.574
Is that right? Yep.

34:00.576 --> 34:04.678
Yeah. What's she want?

34:04.680 --> 34:07.648
She wants a horse.
Like, a real horse?

34:07.650 --> 34:12.686
Yep. Yeah?

34:12.688 --> 34:15.956
Where you gonna put it?

34:15.958 --> 34:18.225
You know what?
I know a man who... who could

34:18.226 --> 34:20.327
sell you one for... for not a
bad price.

34:20.329 --> 34:21.995
You do? I do.

34:21.996 --> 34:27.167
I can't take care of no horse.

34:27.168 --> 34:31.905
Well... No horse.
Maybe I could, uh... maybe I

34:31.907 --> 34:35.175
could bring her something. Why?

34:35.177 --> 34:39.612
Well, I was just doing some
cleaning, and...

34:39.614 --> 34:42.949
I-I may have a few deals just
floating around that maybe,

34:42.952 --> 34:44.518
uh... maybe she'd take to,
you know?

34:44.520 --> 34:46.420
Just... A few deals, huh?

34:46.422 --> 34:47.821
A few deals.

34:47.822 --> 34:55.822
Dear Ruth...
I don't know how to start this

34:59.868 --> 35:02.703
letter.
I have got a million things on

35:02.705 --> 35:05.138
my mind, and I need to get them
out.

35:05.140 --> 35:07.841
I know you know I am out, and I
hope you know I am coming for

35:07.843 --> 35:12.112
you, just like I always said.
Just like I always said I was

35:12.114 --> 35:15.983
going to do, I am coming for
you.

35:15.985 --> 35:19.286
I wish I were standing at your
side, whispering in your ear,

35:19.288 --> 35:22.789
but that's not so.
I came across the woods and

35:22.791 --> 35:29.763
mountains with no shoes on.
I traveled high and far, and now

35:29.765 --> 35:33.934
I am close.
I'm so close to you, I can

35:33.936 --> 35:37.004
almost reach out and touch your
cheek.

36:19.682 --> 36:27.682
Here you go, don.

36:43.305 --> 36:51.305
You boys take it easy, now.

36:52.481 --> 37:00.481
Well... Look at you, Bob.

37:07.096 --> 37:10.864
Break out of parson and head
straight back here.

37:10.866 --> 37:16.203
Maybe not the smartest move.
Long as you don't turn me in.

37:16.205 --> 37:24.205
Where's Miles? Miles is gone.

37:34.890 --> 37:38.992
Gone? Gladys is gone, too.

37:38.994 --> 37:46.994
It's just me now.
Well, who's running the show?

37:47.369 --> 37:54.341
No show to run... not anymore.

37:54.343 --> 37:59.813
Didn't this belong to Freddy?
Doubt it.

37:59.815 --> 38:07.053
I remember playing with this.
And all those little Indians...

38:07.055 --> 38:09.156
have you got those Indians
someplace?

38:09.158 --> 38:15.328
Anything of Freddy's is long
gone.

38:15.330 --> 38:20.066
Hmm. What do you want, Bob?

38:20.068 --> 38:22.869
I was just wondering if you'd
heard anything.

38:22.871 --> 38:29.910
About what?
About that local man who

38:29.912 --> 38:35.148
escaped from the penitentiary.
Gene dentler and a bunch of

38:35.150 --> 38:38.385
his deputies come over a few
days ago for a chat.

38:38.387 --> 38:41.254
I told them I could think of at
least six sons of bitches who've

38:41.256 --> 38:46.526
got a mind to see you dead but
that it'd be more fun to sit

38:46.528 --> 38:52.098
back and take bets on who gets
you first.

38:52.100 --> 38:55.368
You fucked over your share of
people in your day.

38:55.370 --> 39:01.074
Yeah, and then I got caught.
Not by them, you didn't.

39:01.076 --> 39:04.277
Well, they might as well quit
looking.

39:04.279 --> 39:08.548
Old Bob muldoon's about to
disappear.

39:08.550 --> 39:12.285
And where's old Bob muldoon
gonna disappear to?

39:12.287 --> 39:19.459
I'm thinking about settling
down, build a little house, open

39:19.461 --> 39:23.396
a shop. I don't know.

39:23.398 --> 39:31.271
Get old. Like you.

39:31.273 --> 39:34.140
On your own?

39:34.142 --> 39:42.142
Oh. So, I heard you bought
Ruth a house.

39:44.486 --> 39:47.654
I'm letting her stay in one
of my old places.

39:47.656 --> 39:51.224
It's got a big old yard where
her little girl can play.

39:51.226 --> 39:54.661
Hey, that's my little girl,
too.

39:54.663 --> 40:00.233
Man, I'll tell you
she's about cute enough to make

40:00.235 --> 40:06.506
you want to give up.
You did one thing right.

40:06.508 --> 40:10.510
I'll give you that.
I do what I can to look after

40:10.512 --> 40:14.648
both of them. Yeah.

40:14.650 --> 40:18.318
Well, I guess I'll handle it
from here.

40:18.320 --> 40:22.289
Oh, you think so? Yes, sir.

40:22.291 --> 40:30.291
Well, I'll tell you what.
You do whatever you want.

40:30.532 --> 40:35.268
You take all your money and you
get yourself as far away from

40:35.270 --> 40:38.972
here as you possibly can.
But you listen to me when I tell

40:38.974 --> 40:46.012
you...
You leave those girls alone.

40:46.014 --> 40:53.119
I can't do that. Yeah, you can.

40:53.121 --> 40:59.492
And why would I?
Well, now, think about it,

40:59.494 --> 41:04.297
Bob.
If you got any trouble coming

41:04.299 --> 41:07.200
your way...
They sure as hell don't need

41:07.202 --> 41:15.202
that. What trouble is that?

41:16.044 --> 41:22.549
You got out.
What more do you want?

41:22.551 --> 41:24.951
I want my family.

41:24.953 --> 41:32.953
So do I. But I don't got it.

41:33.829 --> 41:38.064
Now, this is how it works.
I will never hurt you more than

41:38.066 --> 41:41.801
I'm hurting you now.
I will never lay another hand to

41:41.803 --> 41:46.106
you or prick your finger or
pinch your cheek.

41:46.108 --> 41:49.442
I won't call the sheriff, and I
won't tell them where you've

41:49.444 --> 41:52.612
been. But if I hear that

41:52.614 --> 41:57.150
old Bob muldoon has been talking
to Ruth Guthrie...

41:57.152 --> 42:03.089
You asked me about trouble.
I will make sure you got some.

42:03.091 --> 42:11.091
Freddy was the one who shot

42:23.545 --> 42:27.881
first that day.
Nobody would have gotten hurt if

42:27.883 --> 42:33.086
he hadn't done that.
Go on, Bob.

42:33.088 --> 42:38.892
I got to unlock my door.
Get out of here before someone

42:38.894 --> 42:41.895
sees you.
Find yourself someplace safe.

42:41.897 --> 42:46.900
Where are the keys?

42:46.902 --> 42:48.802
In the truck. The keys?

42:48.804 --> 42:52.839
I'm gonna give her trouble?
I'm gonna give her trouble?

42:52.841 --> 42:56.176
He thinks he can buy her a
house?

42:56.178 --> 42:57.811
No, sir.
I don't think that's how it

42:57.813 --> 43:00.413
works.
Ruth will walk away from that

43:00.415 --> 43:04.851
house like it was on fire.

43:04.853 --> 43:07.153
Pen... I need a pen.

43:07.155 --> 43:10.156
Give me a pen.

43:10.158 --> 43:16.763
No damn sense.

43:16.765 --> 43:17.445
Excuse me.

43:40.889 --> 43:41.569
Come here.

44:53.528 --> 45:01.528
I was thinking...
Maybe we could go on a trip...

45:06.975 --> 45:12.278
After your birthday.
What do you think about that...

45:12.280 --> 45:18.318
going someplace new?
Just get in the car and drive

45:18.320 --> 45:22.288
and drive. Be real fun.

45:22.290 --> 45:30.290
Hey!

45:30.599 --> 45:33.867
Hey, hold on.

45:35.871 --> 45:43.871
Let me see that. Give it here.

45:54.356 --> 46:02.356
There you go. Come on. Go.

46:16.344 --> 46:24.117
What do you think about me
closin' up... take you for a

46:24.119 --> 46:27.887
ride somewhere...
Get away for a little bit?

46:27.889 --> 46:30.323
Hmm?

46:33.361 --> 46:36.896
Hey, sweetie.

46:36.898 --> 46:40.400
How you been? Just fine.

46:40.402 --> 46:44.837
Break the law or something?

46:44.839 --> 46:48.107
No.
I just hadn't seen you around in

46:48.109 --> 46:51.911
years, it feels like.
I stay put.

46:51.913 --> 46:55.515
You want something to drink?
No, sir. Thank you.

46:55.517 --> 46:58.785
We're looking for an old friend
of yours.

46:58.787 --> 47:02.355
I'm sure you heard the news.
Yeah. Yeah.

47:02.357 --> 47:05.658
A couple cops came by from
Monroe's asking questions.

47:05.660 --> 47:10.363
All right. Have you seen him?

47:10.365 --> 47:14.567
Sure haven't. Look, all right.

47:14.569 --> 47:19.038
You mind if I take a look
around?

47:19.040 --> 47:24.177
Billy, mind the bar?
Hope we can make this quick.

47:24.179 --> 47:27.180
Don't want to rile up my
customers.

47:27.182 --> 47:31.451
Haven't heard from him since

47:31.453 --> 47:33.386
last winter.
He sent me a letter.

47:33.388 --> 47:37.757
You write him back? Nope.

47:37.759 --> 47:40.693
Weren't you part of his old
gang... Bob muldoon,

47:40.695 --> 47:43.796
Ruth Guthrie, Freddy?
Nope. Got out of that racket.

47:43.798 --> 47:49.335
Got myself this business.

47:49.337 --> 47:57.337
Hell.
Left the darn key downstairs.

47:59.080 --> 48:02.448
Well... Hold up.

48:19.501 --> 48:27.501
I'm gonna need to get back to
the register before too long.

48:33.148 --> 48:41.148
Been using it as a bookmark.
I guess I lost my place.

48:53.234 --> 48:56.903
Ruth give it to you?
She mailed it.

48:56.905 --> 49:02.909
Asked me, uh... asked me to send
it on to Bob.

49:02.911 --> 49:06.579
You never did.
Like I said, I'm bad with

49:06.581 --> 49:11.651
correspondence. How long ago?

49:11.653 --> 49:17.123
How old's the little girl?
3, going on 4.

49:17.125 --> 49:22.829
About that long, then. Okay.

49:22.831 --> 49:28.134
Uh, mind if I hang on to this?
By all means.

49:28.136 --> 49:30.870
I'm sure you'll call us if
you hear anything.

49:30.872 --> 49:32.872
Sure bet.

49:32.874 --> 49:40.874
Look at this.

49:41.716 --> 49:48.988
This is the first thing you ever
wore, the day you were born.

49:48.990 --> 49:56.990
You were so tiny.
Look how small it is.

49:57.065 --> 50:00.299
I brought you home, and you
slept and slept for hours.

50:00.301 --> 50:05.838
You were such a good little
girl.

50:05.840 --> 50:11.310
I'll bring this with us just
because...

50:11.312 --> 50:17.116
We might need it someday.
"And the little horse picked up"

50:17.118 --> 50:22.355
his shoes and ran until he was
out of the dark woods.

50:22.357 --> 50:24.590
He came to the river where the
fish had been.

50:24.592 --> 50:27.627
The fish was gone now, and there
was no one there to stop him

50:27.629 --> 50:31.664
from crossing.
He crossed the river and climbed

50:31.666 --> 50:37.837
"the hill, and before too long,
he could see home."

50:37.839 --> 50:44.010
What's wrong, sweet girl?
Why are you so quiet?

50:44.012 --> 50:49.081
Everything's gonna be fine.
You just wait and see, okay?

50:51.186 --> 50:59.186
Have you heard from Bob?

52:23.778 --> 52:27.113
Why don't you come in? No.

52:27.115 --> 52:31.751
I know Bob's been around.
Will you see to it that he gets

52:31.753 --> 52:36.155
this? What is it?

52:36.157 --> 52:41.894
You can read it if you want.
I figure you will anyway.

52:41.896 --> 52:49.502
If you see him...
Can you tell him...

52:49.504 --> 52:51.671
Just... just give it to him.

52:51.673 --> 52:59.673
Dear Bob...
I hope you never get this.

53:15.797 --> 53:19.231
I want you to come through that
door, take us away just like you

53:19.233 --> 53:27.233
always said. But you can't.

53:27.508 --> 53:32.745
You can't come here... not right
now.

53:32.747 --> 53:37.817
And I can't go with you.
If you come here, they'll catch

53:37.819 --> 53:41.487
you.
If we go with you, they'll find

53:41.489 --> 53:46.058
us. It can't end like that.

53:46.060 --> 53:50.463
I can't let it end like that,
not for us...

53:50.465 --> 53:56.335
And not for sylvie.
I can't let that happen.

53:56.337 --> 54:03.909
So, we're gonna go.
If you come looking for us here,

54:03.911 --> 54:08.147
we'll be gone.
I'll go somewhere where no one

54:08.149 --> 54:14.920
knows who we are, or we can wait
for the time to be right and the

54:14.922 --> 54:20.793
world to forget about us.
I don't know how to explain this

54:20.795 --> 54:26.832
any better, but I know you know
what I'm talking about.

54:26.834 --> 54:30.770
We've waited so long.
We've just got to wait a little

54:30.772 --> 54:33.773
longer.

54:33.775 --> 54:40.212
Come find us. I know you will.

54:40.214 --> 54:48.214
I hope you will.
We'll find each other.

54:48.289 --> 54:52.258
I love you so much. I do.

54:52.260 --> 55:00.260
It's time to wake up, baby girl.

55:18.286 --> 55:26.286
Sweet pea...

55:28.596 --> 55:33.399
Good morning. Happy Birthday.

56:40.401 --> 56:41.285
You seen him?

58:12.193 --> 58:19.765
We stopped by his girl's place.

58:19.767 --> 58:27.767
Hartigan said to tell you
something if we ran into you.

58:33.714 --> 58:37.816
What's that?

58:37.818 --> 58:43.455
Shit, I forgot. Oh.

58:43.457 --> 58:48.193
Let me tell you something.
You take that and do what you

58:48.195 --> 58:53.198
will.
And if you don't find him...

58:53.200 --> 58:56.135
That don't give you cause to
come back here.

58:56.137 --> 59:01.306
You understand?
Don't think I'm washing my hands

59:01.308 --> 59:05.844
of all this.
And if you set foot in this town

59:05.846 --> 59:10.349
again...
If you even think about bringing

59:10.351 --> 59:16.121
those girls into this...
I'll kill you.

59:16.123 --> 59:19.892
And that'll be that. Dude.

59:22.897 --> 59:27.399
Warren Miller.
Who makes up the names?

59:27.401 --> 59:30.202
They ain't made up.
They're real folks.

59:30.204 --> 59:33.372
I mean, they're dead, but...
They're real.

59:33.374 --> 59:36.775
Oh, really? Mm-hmm.

59:36.777 --> 59:39.545
So I'm told.
Ruth and sylvie, too?

59:39.547 --> 59:44.450
Yep. Nobody's gonna be asking

59:44.452 --> 59:47.820
after us? Not anymore.

59:47.822 --> 59:50.189
Good job.

59:50.191 --> 59:53.559
You make a wish?
What did you wish for?

59:53.561 --> 59:56.228
I'm not telling. All right.

59:56.230 --> 59:58.931
You keep your little secret,
huh?

01:00:01.102 --> 01:00:09.102
How do I look?
You look like you.

01:00:31.966 --> 01:00:37.836
Then that'll do.
The way I see it, I didn't waste

01:00:37.838 --> 01:00:41.173
my time.
You remember old Joe cranston?

01:00:41.175 --> 01:00:44.910
Yep.
Remember that time he and I

01:00:44.912 --> 01:00:46.578
went up to St. Louis? Mm-hmm.

01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:49.815
He spent about three hours
getting prettied up before we

01:00:49.817 --> 01:00:50.983
got in the car to go up there.
I said, "Joe, what are you"

01:00:50.985 --> 01:00:54.787
doing?"
He said, "well, in case anything

01:00:54.789 --> 01:00:59.057
happens to me, I want to make
sure my mama can recognize me."

01:00:59.059 --> 01:01:01.727
So he put on this coat he had
when he was 12 years old, and he

01:01:01.729 --> 01:01:04.096
tried to button it up, and he
was a big old boy, and it ripped

01:01:04.098 --> 01:01:07.766
right out the back.
And he kept that thing on all

01:01:07.768 --> 01:01:10.702
the way up to St. Louis and back
down to Texas.

01:01:10.704 --> 01:01:13.205
He looked like a damn
raggedy Ann.

01:01:13.207 --> 01:01:16.141
And when we got back, I said,
"Joe, you know your mama would

01:01:16.143 --> 01:01:18.477
have recognized you if something
happened to you."

01:01:18.479 --> 01:01:21.380
He said, "yeah, 'cause I had my
coat on."

01:01:21.382 --> 01:01:23.882
I mean, he didn't get it.
You see, people... they don't

01:01:23.884 --> 01:01:26.251
know things the way that they
think they know them.

01:01:29.757 --> 01:01:36.628
Sylvie... she's gonna know me.

01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:43.335
She'll know me without looking
at me.

01:01:43.337 --> 01:01:49.274
And Ruth... by God, she'll feel
me coming down the street.

01:01:49.276 --> 01:01:54.847
I mean, we always just been...
You know, just two parts of the

01:01:54.849 --> 01:02:00.252
same.
I mean, we would fight, and we'd

01:02:00.254 --> 01:02:05.324
fight like two kids with a ball.
And she'd rip through the house

01:02:05.326 --> 01:02:09.328
like she was on fire, and I'd
just want to hold her.

01:02:09.330 --> 01:02:11.330
I'd just want to hold her.

01:02:11.332 --> 01:02:13.398
But she'd be yelling and
flapping around so quick, it was

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:20.439
like a hummingbird.
I'd say, "Ruth..."

01:02:20.441 --> 01:02:23.709
You can scream at me till your
voice is gone...

01:02:23.711 --> 01:02:27.346
But it doesn't make much
difference...

01:02:27.348 --> 01:02:31.083
Because when you're all done
screaming...

01:02:31.085 --> 01:02:36.054
"It's just gonna be you and me
sitting here in a room."

01:02:36.056 --> 01:02:40.859
And she said, "that's right.
It's always just gonna be the"

01:02:40.861 --> 01:02:45.864
"two of us."

01:02:45.866 --> 01:02:53.866
Look how pretty that is.
You like that?

01:03:01.348 --> 01:03:04.750
Happy Birthday.

01:03:04.752 --> 01:03:11.490
Well, there's, uh, one
last... Surprise, I suppose.

01:03:11.492 --> 01:03:15.127

01:03:15.129 --> 01:03:18.797

Yeah.

Ruth.

01:11:15.575 --> 01:11:21.045
I want to tell you something.
This has been, uh, weighing on

01:11:21.047 --> 01:11:26.484
me for some time.
Uh... When I was in the hospital,

01:11:26.486 --> 01:11:32.857
I wasn't, uh... I wasn't sitting
there making plans or anything.

01:11:32.859 --> 01:11:36.127
You know, I got nothing against
Bob.

01:11:36.129 --> 01:11:39.130
And what happened... I mean,
that's the risk.

01:11:39.132 --> 01:11:42.967
That's... that's part of my job.
And beyond that, I don't hold it

01:11:42.969 --> 01:11:46.237
against him to be who he was or
do what he was doing, and I

01:11:46.239 --> 01:11:49.841
still don't.
I'm glad to be alive.

01:11:49.843 --> 01:11:53.945
I'm glad to know you.
And if you weren't who you were

01:11:53.947 --> 01:11:58.650
and had never been with him and
somehow we had still come

01:11:58.652 --> 01:12:06.652
together right here, right now,
I wouldn't feel any different.

01:12:06.893 --> 01:12:13.598

You remember that day?

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:17.135

I remember feeling like I'm

getting punched in the shoulder,
seeing the big old Texas sky.

01:12:21.041 --> 01:12:25.009
I remember that, but, uh...
Did you see me?

01:12:25.011 --> 01:12:29.047
No, ma'am.

01:12:29.049 --> 01:12:34.953
after? I read your statement.

01:12:34.955 --> 01:12:38.957
It wasn't all true, you know.
I wasn't just a little girl who

01:12:38.959 --> 01:12:42.126
got dragged in over her head.
I knew what I was doing.

01:12:42.128 --> 01:12:47.499
Well... I think that, uh...

01:12:47.501 --> 01:12:53.104
A lot of things were said that
might not have been true.

So did he.

01:15:52.352 --> 01:16:00.352
Ugh.

01:16:04.264 --> 01:16:12.264
God damn it.

01:16:18.278 --> 01:16:26.278
You shot me.
Why'd you shoot me?

01:16:27.587 --> 01:16:31.122
I've never even seen you.
No, sir.

01:16:31.124 --> 01:16:34.592
What's this about... money?

01:16:34.594 --> 01:16:42.594
You... it's about you.
You and the girl.

01:16:42.635 --> 01:16:50.635
Everything you tried to do.

01:16:51.377 --> 01:16:59.377
You gonna shoot me?

01:17:33.453 --> 01:17:41.453
I don't want you to think I

01:17:42.695 --> 01:17:46.330
owe you anything.
No, you don't.

01:17:46.332 --> 01:17:49.867
The only person I owe
anything to is Bob.

01:17:49.869 --> 01:17:56.908
That's not so.
I've been storing things up

01:17:56.910 --> 01:18:02.013
all this time...
Sitting awake at night, thinking

01:18:02.015 --> 01:18:06.784
of all the things I want to say
to him.

01:18:06.786 --> 01:18:10.221
Except now I have so many
things, I don't know how I'd

01:18:10.223 --> 01:18:15.259
ever start.
All I had was sylvie and I.

01:18:15.261 --> 01:18:18.563
I didn't know how to write about
her.

01:18:18.565 --> 01:18:23.868
How do you write about something
like that?

01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:29.507
I remember the day she was born.
I was so scared, and I tried to

01:18:29.509 --> 01:18:36.280
keep her from coming, but she
came anyway.

01:18:36.282 --> 01:18:38.316
And when they put her in my
arms...

01:18:38.318 --> 01:18:40.718
Ugh!

01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:44.488
We just stared at one
another, and I thought I would

01:18:44.490 --> 01:18:49.427
die from all that love.
And I tried to write to him

01:18:49.429 --> 01:18:52.930
about it so he'd know what it
was like, but... but I just

01:18:52.932 --> 01:18:55.733
couldn't find the words to do it
right.

01:18:55.735 --> 01:18:59.871
So, I just stopped... stopped
writing to him.

01:18:59.873 --> 01:19:05.276
I figured that I'd just tell him
all at once when I saw him.

01:19:05.278 --> 01:19:09.313
He'd walk through the door, and
I'd know exactly what to say to

01:19:09.315 --> 01:19:12.283
him, and things would be the way
they used to be.

01:19:12.285 --> 01:19:16.287
That's why I've been saving
every little thing.

01:19:16.289 --> 01:19:24.289
And I haven't slept in four
years...

01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:34.900
And I'm tired.
I'm just so goddamn tired.

01:19:35.608 --> 01:19:41.112
Then rest.
Will you wait with me while I

01:19:41.114 --> 01:19:43.281
do?

01:20:06.372 --> 01:20:14.372
Are you all right? Okay?
Hey, what are you... what are

01:20:14.948 --> 01:20:16.781
you doing? Drive, man. Drive.

01:20:16.783 --> 01:20:19.483
Please, just take the keys.
Step on the gas, man!

01:20:19.485 --> 01:20:21.986
Step on the gas!

01:20:21.988 --> 01:20:23.721
All right.

01:20:23.723 --> 01:20:26.891
And just stick to the highway.
When you get to highway 6, you

01:20:26.893 --> 01:20:29.026
turn right.
I-I'm just trying to go see

01:20:29.028 --> 01:20:31.162
my family, okay?
I'm just trying to get home.

01:20:31.164 --> 01:20:33.731
I ain't gonna put up a fight.
I'll do whatever you want.

01:20:33.733 --> 01:20:35.800
I just want to make sure I get
home to them.

01:20:35.802 --> 01:20:40.371
I just want you to drive.

What? What family have you got?

01:20:50.450 --> 01:20:55.519
You have a wife and kids? No.

01:20:55.521 --> 01:21:00.391
No, I'm going to see my parents.
Your parents?

01:21:00.393 --> 01:21:02.960
Mom and dad? Yeah.

01:21:02.962 --> 01:21:06.597
What's your name?

01:21:06.599 --> 01:21:12.403
Will. Will's your name?

01:21:12.405 --> 01:21:16.007
Yeah.
Will, do you have anything to

01:21:16.009 --> 01:21:20.044
drink? No.

01:21:20.046 --> 01:21:22.813
You don't? Unh-unh.

01:21:22.815 --> 01:21:27.118
Shoot.
I could go for some water.

01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:34.959
You need to... you need to go

01:21:34.961 --> 01:21:38.896
to a hospital or something?
No, man.

01:21:38.898 --> 01:21:42.099
Just stay on the highway.
Turn at highway number 6.

01:21:42.101 --> 01:21:46.771
Yes, sir.

01:21:46.773 --> 01:21:54.773
Well, I guess you can tell I got

01:21:54.914 --> 01:21:57.448
shot. Yep.

01:21:57.450 --> 01:22:03.521
These men came looking for me.

01:22:03.523 --> 01:22:09.994
They wanted to put me under.
Somebody sent them, and they

01:22:09.996 --> 01:22:15.866
came from somewhere, and they
got me.

01:22:15.868 --> 01:22:21.639
They got me pretty good.
They didn't get me good enough.

01:22:28.014 --> 01:22:33.884
See... Ohh.

01:22:33.886 --> 01:22:36.887

ride to today.

01:22:36.889 --> 01:22:37.569
Okay. Who?

Hey!

Drop it!

01:24:27.633 --> 01:24:32.136
It's all right.

01:24:32.138 --> 01:24:37.141
You remember...

01:24:37.143 --> 01:24:41.612
Remember the first run you ever
did for me?

01:24:41.614 --> 01:24:47.618
Huh? Heh. You and Freddy.

01:24:47.620 --> 01:24:52.957
The very first one.
Nah, I never did nothing for

01:24:52.959 --> 01:24:56.193
you, sir.

01:24:56.195 --> 01:25:04.195
You both thought you were so
tough.

01:25:05.805 --> 01:25:13.805
You were little boys.

01:25:14.213 --> 01:25:22.213
Ohh.

01:25:38.938 --> 01:25:46.938
I want to go home.
I was on the line with Morgan

01:26:16.275 --> 01:26:18.208
10 minutes ago... told him how
it happened.

01:26:18.210 --> 01:26:20.010
No, no, no.
You get 'em back on the phone

01:26:20.012 --> 01:26:22.146
'till they come down here.
I don't know who did what to

01:26:22.148 --> 01:26:23.714
who. Did you get an I.D. Yet?

01:26:23.716 --> 01:26:27.117
No.
I mean, yeah, but he was just

01:26:27.119 --> 01:26:28.886
some son of a bitch up near
burleson.

01:26:28.888 --> 01:26:32.956
Who knows?
Skerritt went out like a sucker,

01:26:32.958 --> 01:26:37.528
huh?
I'm gonna take Ruth on home.

01:26:37.530 --> 01:26:42.700
No, I got Teddy doing that.
Yeah, I'm gonna take her.

01:26:42.702 --> 01:26:50.702
Wait here.

01:27:20.139 --> 01:27:28.139

It's okay. It's okay.

Stop it. That tickles.
I thought that's what we're

01:28:30.509 --> 01:28:37.648
supposed to do... sing to 'em.
Just talk.

01:28:37.650 --> 01:28:44.188
Well...
Let me tell you about something.

01:28:44.190 --> 01:28:47.991
I'm gonna tell you about the
future.

In the future, I'm a very old
man.

01:28:52.131 --> 01:28:57.367
And I'm standing in the door.
We're in a house.

01:28:57.369 --> 01:29:03.407
It's our house, somewhere far
away from here, where everything

01:29:03.409 --> 01:29:07.478
is green and the sun is almost
set.

01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:11.248
And where we're standing, the
way I see it, we're waving to

01:29:11.250 --> 01:29:18.188
somebody.
And maybe that somebody is you,

01:29:18.190 --> 01:29:24.394
come to see us after a long time
gone.

01:29:24.396 --> 01:29:31.301
If it is you...
We are very happy to see you.

Hey, sweetie.

Tell me more about that house.

I'm not talking to you.

01:30:10.943 --> 01:30:15.646
It's big... Maybe a farm.

01:30:15.648 --> 01:30:22.586
It's old. It's older than us.

like maybe I built it.
