00:20.688 --> 00:22.388
Now, that's pretty darn good.

I think this deserves
a piece of chocolate.

Hi! Chocolate's out.
Must be a good day of work.

00:44.011 --> 00:45.077
Had a bit
of a breakthrough.

00:45.112 --> 00:45.878
Ooh!

00:45.913 --> 00:48.313
Well, Luke did
escape his captors

00:48.349 --> 00:49.915
and he's on his
way back to Abby.

00:49.950 --> 00:50.916
Oh! At last.

00:50.951 --> 00:51.984
Yes! But--

00:52.019 --> 00:52.985
will Abby have
the courage

00:53.020 --> 00:53.952
to give up
her safe world

00:53.988 --> 00:54.987
and accept
his love?

00:55.022 --> 00:56.455
That is
the question.

00:56.490 --> 00:57.456
I vote for love.

00:57.491 --> 00:58.457
You always do.

00:59.994 --> 01:01.527
Especially
in the real world.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.595
Mm, no thanks.
It's enough to write about it,

01:03.631 --> 01:05.129
and to give
my best friend advice about

01:05.166 --> 01:06.865
what to get her boyfriend
for his birthday, which--

01:06.901 --> 01:09.501

the Yankees tickets.

01:09.537 --> 01:10.669
Thank you very much.

01:10.704 --> 01:11.770
I knew it.

Outsider's clarity

01:18.746 --> 01:20.479
Nobody should be

People who can see romance
with clear eyes

01:26.754 --> 01:28.554
and then recreate it
for people like you.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.789
Or you could try living it.

01:30.825 --> 01:32.324
-Did that.
-Once.

Once was enough.

The "uh-oh" face.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.710
It's my publisher, Diana.

01:51.745 --> 01:52.911
Why aren't
you answering?

01:52.947 --> 01:54.713
'Cause she
never calls me.

01:54.748 --> 01:56.882
It's always her assistant
or my ex-editor.

What was his name?

01:58.385 --> 02:00.519
We don't mention him, either.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.588
Okay, seriously, answer.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.089
No, this can't be good news.

You are adorably
frustrating sometimes.

02:17.071 --> 02:18.103
I know.

the new draft of my book.

was premature.

02:41.128 --> 02:42.127
Well, yeah, I'm pretty sure

02:42.163 --> 02:44.897
this has to do with
the whole editing fiasco.

02:44.932 --> 02:47.166
I thought we didn't
talk about that.

02:47.201 --> 02:49.001
Well, I do have
this impromptu meeting

02:49.036 --> 02:51.103

from the last book.

as your last book,

03:03.217 --> 03:04.750
and, let's face it,
my last book was--

03:04.785 --> 03:06.251
ah!

03:06.287 --> 03:07.486
Ohh!

03:07.521 --> 03:09.121

from potential injury!

03:11.025 --> 03:14.092

down a sidewalk!

03:14.128 --> 03:16.028
Danger can come from
any direction and at any moment.

03:16.063 --> 03:18.263
Yeah, like from
an iced mocha

03:18.299 --> 03:20.132
and a stranger
with a hero complex?

03:20.167 --> 03:22.267
Or from a skateboarder
and a distracted pedestrian.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.203
What skateboarder?

03:24.238 --> 03:25.304
Exactly.

I know.

03:48.329 --> 03:49.228
And I suppose,
if there had been one,

03:49.263 --> 03:51.730
then your actions
would have been warranted.

03:51.765 --> 03:53.398
I think the words
you're looking for

03:53.434 --> 03:55.167
are "thank"
and "you".

A gentleman always holds
the door for a lady.

04:17.124 --> 04:18.156

this lady prefers

04:18.192 --> 04:19.156
to hold her own door,

04:19.192 --> 04:20.259
so I'm good.

04:20.293 --> 04:21.860

at the same time.

let this go, can you?

for <i> flames of desire.</i>

04:50.758 --> 04:53.959

as I always say,

04:53.994 --> 04:55.861
those who can, write,

04:55.896 --> 04:57.863

-All right.

05:00.467 --> 05:01.333
And the readers.

05:01.368 --> 05:02.901
Here's the thing.
There were some facts

05:02.936 --> 05:04.036
that were a little off
about the firefighters--

05:04.071 --> 05:05.270

05:05.306 --> 05:06.872
But it's
the editor's job

05:06.907 --> 05:07.773
to catch that.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.075
And that's why
the editor is now gone.

05:10.110 --> 05:11.209
Mm! Problem solved!

05:11.245 --> 05:12.944
Mm. No.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.646
That wasn't the only problem.

05:14.682 --> 05:16.615
Oh. Really?

05:16.650 --> 05:17.916
Jo, I bought

05:17.951 --> 05:19.251
your first book

05:19.286 --> 05:21.386
because your voice
was fresh.

05:21.422 --> 05:24.556
It was exciting
and engaged.

05:24.591 --> 05:26.892
Today,
you're none of those things,

05:26.927 --> 05:28.260
and it shows.

05:29.630 --> 05:30.829
That was blunt.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.064
I could be
blunter.

05:32.099 --> 05:32.964
No, I'm good.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
I read the first draft
of <i> sealed,</i>

05:35.035 --> 05:36.968
and, frankly,
you're on the same road

05:37.004 --> 05:39.004
to making the same mistakes
you made in <i> flames.</i>

05:39.039 --> 05:40.072
Well, but it--

05:40.107 --> 05:40.906
it's a first draft.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.774
Just as you said,
we will get there.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.676
Yes, we will get it,
and we're gonna get it now.

05:44.712 --> 05:47.279
Only, this time, we need
to do things differently.

05:47.314 --> 05:49.114
We need to take
a different approach.

05:49.149 --> 05:51.650
Sales on your last two books
have been down.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.685
We cannot afford
another disaster.

05:53.721 --> 05:56.421
You cannot afford
another disaster.

05:56.457 --> 05:58.423
Well, that was
really ominous, Diana.

05:58.459 --> 05:59.524
Good.

05:59.560 --> 06:02.327
Because we are three months
away from publication,

06:02.363 --> 06:05.597
and, Jo, your next pass
has to be darn near perfect.

06:05.632 --> 06:07.299
What, "or else"?

06:07.334 --> 06:08.800
Yes. Or else.

06:11.205 --> 06:13.071
What do you suggest?

06:16.009 --> 06:17.209
A consultant?

06:17.244 --> 06:19.811
Not just any consultant.
A retired Navy seal.

06:19.847 --> 06:20.846
Highly-decorated.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.014
Silver star,
several bronze stars.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.549
You get to learn
from the source,

06:24.585 --> 06:25.650
immerse yourself
in the world.

06:25.686 --> 06:26.885
Immerse myself?

06:26.920 --> 06:28.387
That's right, you're
gonna do what they do,

06:28.422 --> 06:30.122
breathe the same air.
Crawl in the mud.

06:30.157 --> 06:31.456
-The mud?
-The mud.

06:31.492 --> 06:33.992
This is not googleland
anymore, Jo.

06:34.027 --> 06:35.460
This is hands-on
research.

06:35.496 --> 06:38.530
Okay, fine.
So, who is this guy?

06:38.565 --> 06:40.966
Captain Colin Kelly
at your service.

06:41.001 --> 06:42.968
[Chuckles]

06:43.003 --> 06:44.035
Of course you are.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.203
Have you two
already met?

06:45.239 --> 06:46.238
Not officially.

06:46.273 --> 06:48.039
Until now, Ms. payden.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.307
Captain Kelly.

06:49.343 --> 06:50.475
"Kelly." Wait.

06:50.511 --> 06:51.543
That's right, Jo.

06:51.578 --> 06:54.346
This is my younger
brother, Colin.

06:54.381 --> 06:56.948
Great!

06:59.686 --> 07:01.520
Well, did you read it?

07:01.555 --> 07:03.054
I did.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.890
Ahem. And?

07:04.925 --> 07:07.058
We have our work
cut out for us.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.493
We?

07:08.529 --> 07:10.929
Yes. You, me. "We".

07:10.964 --> 07:12.898
Did you do any research?

07:12.933 --> 07:14.433
I always do my research,

07:14.468 --> 07:15.567
but just so you know,

07:15.602 --> 07:18.103
the main focus
is the love story.

07:18.138 --> 07:19.237
Yeah, that's a problem, too.

07:19.273 --> 07:20.739
I'm sorry?

07:20.774 --> 07:23.275
Why on earth would
these two fall for each other?

07:23.310 --> 07:24.910
They're total opposites.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.945
Right, but deep down,
see, they're very similar.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.113
Neh.

07:28.148 --> 07:29.948
Neh?
Did you just "neh" my romance?

07:29.983 --> 07:30.916
Realistically,

07:30.951 --> 07:33.118
they'd break up in six months,
a year tops.

He's a man of action,

07:34.621 --> 07:37.055
and she's a florist
who hasn't left Tulsa.

07:37.090 --> 07:38.757
Okay.

07:38.792 --> 07:39.925
They're yin
and Yang.

07:39.960 --> 07:43.228
Well, at least you didn't say
they complete each other.

07:43.263 --> 07:45.263
Okay, captain cynical.

07:45.299 --> 07:46.698
Your job is gonna be
to make sure

07:46.733 --> 07:48.233
that the seal parts
are accurate.

07:48.268 --> 07:49.534
I will do the writing.

07:49.570 --> 07:50.535
And for the record,

07:50.571 --> 07:53.872
I am only here
because Diana asked me to be.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.407
Well, we have
one thing in common.

07:57.277 --> 07:58.710
Tomorrow morning.

07:58.745 --> 08:00.946
5:30 A.M. be there.

08:02.916 --> 08:06.151
And how is this supposed
to help me writing my book?

08:06.186 --> 08:08.220
If you're gonna write
with any authenticity

08:08.255 --> 08:09.754
about the Navy seals,

08:09.790 --> 08:12.390
you need to get to know them
at the most basic level.

08:12.426 --> 08:14.159
I promise...

08:14.194 --> 08:16.528
This will be
quite the introduction.

08:17.931 --> 08:19.865
You're on.

08:23.103 --> 08:26.104
"Training seals
before they're seals." Hmm.

08:27.441 --> 08:30.942
I bet that read better
in his head.

08:34.648 --> 08:35.914
You sure about this?

08:35.948 --> 08:37.082
Are you?

08:37.116 --> 08:38.250
It's a big ask.

08:38.284 --> 08:39.518
I think I can
handle the Princess.

08:39.553 --> 08:40.784
Princess?

08:40.821 --> 08:42.587
I read her bio.

08:42.623 --> 08:44.089
Both her parents are professors,

08:44.124 --> 08:46.525
she grew up in the ivory towers
of the Ivy league,

08:46.560 --> 08:48.426
probably hasn't done
a hard work in her life.

08:48.462 --> 08:49.694
Princess.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.429
First thing I learned
as a publisher

08:51.465 --> 08:53.965
is you never believe
everything you read.

08:54.001 --> 08:55.333
I'll keep you
updated.

08:55.369 --> 08:58.103
Just do me a favor.
Do not kill her.

08:58.138 --> 08:59.437
I need to have
this book finished.

08:59.473 --> 09:02.140
No promises.

09:05.812 --> 09:07.379
[Alarm beeping]

09:07.414 --> 09:08.647
Oh...

09:08.682 --> 09:09.748
Oh, no.

09:10.851 --> 09:12.183
[Stops alarm]

09:16.823 --> 09:19.157
Ohh.

09:19.192 --> 09:21.660
[Whimpers]: It's early.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.330
[Sighs darkly]

09:26.700 --> 09:29.167
[Bugle plays "reveille"]

09:29.202 --> 09:32.137
[♪♪♪]

09:37.411 --> 09:40.812
Ohh. I seriously prefer
Google research.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.850
Wow.

09:45.886 --> 09:48.086
If we're gonna work out
at the crack of dawn,

09:48.121 --> 09:50.021
I figured I should wear
reflective clothing.

09:50.057 --> 09:51.556
You know,
safety first.

09:51.592 --> 09:52.991
Yep, there'd be
no missing you.

09:53.026 --> 09:55.093
Wow. You're peppy today.

09:55.128 --> 09:57.095
Always am after
my morning workout.

09:57.130 --> 09:59.197
[Scoffs] You've already
had a workout?

09:59.232 --> 10:01.266
4:30. Every morning.

10:01.301 --> 10:04.169
Discipline is the foundation
of being a seal.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.338
After you.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.611
This is your place, huh?

10:12.646 --> 10:14.579
Yes. One of four I created.

10:14.615 --> 10:17.682
We prepare recruits who plan
to be seals for buds.

10:17.718 --> 10:19.451
"Basic underwater
demolition seals,"

10:19.486 --> 10:21.553
the 24-week
seal-training course.

10:21.588 --> 10:22.854
See? I did some research.

10:22.889 --> 10:24.422
That's good to know.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.024
Um, you don't
expect me to do this

10:26.059 --> 10:27.692
for 24 weeks,
though, right?

10:27.728 --> 10:29.194
Because that's
not possible.

10:29.229 --> 10:31.630
Seals accomplish the impossible
for breakfast,

10:31.665 --> 10:33.398
and the improbable
for lunch.

10:33.433 --> 10:34.866
Ralph,
this is Jo payden.

10:34.901 --> 10:36.368
I figured that.

10:36.403 --> 10:38.570
Jo, this is Ralph lodell,
one of my instructors.

10:38.605 --> 10:40.772
Just fyi...

10:40.807 --> 10:42.307
Um, I am not here
for the impossible,

10:42.342 --> 10:44.042
I'm just here for
a little research.

10:44.077 --> 10:46.244
Research is
the accumulation of facts.

10:46.279 --> 10:49.047
Your task is to understand
what it means to be a seal.

10:49.082 --> 10:51.416
Mm-hmm. And your task
is to teach me.

10:51.451 --> 10:53.018
Oh, I intend to.

10:54.087 --> 10:54.919
Good.

10:56.657 --> 10:58.089
Let's get you
a change of clothes.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.124
Oh, no, thanks.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.292
I feel pretty
cozy as-is.

11:01.328 --> 11:02.627
We have a different style.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.665
[♪♪♪]

11:06.700 --> 11:09.467
Oh, I can't wear those.
There's no arch support.

11:09.503 --> 11:11.236
Plus, I pronate,
so I'm gonna need

11:11.271 --> 11:12.837
something with
a little more structure.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.639
We all do it.
You can, too.

11:14.675 --> 11:16.274
But... but--
[Grunts]

11:16.309 --> 11:17.676
Are these even
in my size?

11:17.711 --> 11:20.245
[Ralph]: Seven and a half.
Narrow.

11:20.280 --> 11:21.946
You're not
my first lady recruit.

11:21.982 --> 11:23.181
But I thought there
were no female seals.

11:23.216 --> 11:25.116
Not yet, but
we don't discriminate.

11:25.152 --> 11:27.318
We'll prep recruits for
army and air force, too.

11:27.354 --> 11:28.186
Oh.

11:28.221 --> 11:29.788
Now it's time for you
to meet your team.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.122
[Gasps]
I have a team?

11:31.158 --> 11:32.357
You have
to change first.

11:32.392 --> 11:36.327
Oh.

11:37.664 --> 11:39.264
[Chuckles]

11:39.299 --> 11:40.665
Oh, boy.

11:42.669 --> 11:44.035
Learning to be
part of a team

11:44.071 --> 11:46.471
is one of, if not
<i> the</i> most important part

11:46.506 --> 11:47.872
of being a seal,

11:47.908 --> 11:49.307
so consider this
lesson number one.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.342
[Shouts]: Team delta,
step forward!

11:53.313 --> 11:55.013
At ease!

11:55.048 --> 11:56.948
This is
Josephine payden.

11:56.983 --> 11:57.916
Hello.

11:57.951 --> 12:01.119
[Colin]: This is pj salizar,
seal recruit.

12:01.154 --> 12:03.688
Carlie Jonas,
army recruit.

12:03.724 --> 12:06.658
And Barry klimpkie,
seal recruit.

12:06.693 --> 12:08.860
He goes by "tiny".
It's ironic.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.395
Yeah, I got it.

12:10.430 --> 12:11.996
Delta team!

12:12.032 --> 12:13.565
How do we greet payden?

12:13.600 --> 12:14.733
[Recruits]: Hooyah!

12:14.768 --> 12:16.167
Oh! Cute! [Giggles]

12:16.203 --> 12:17.769
"Hoo-yah" back.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.043
[Colin]: Tadpoles!

12:25.078 --> 12:26.811
Before you enter buds,

12:26.847 --> 12:29.080
you will be expected
to do the following--

12:29.116 --> 12:30.749
70 push-ups,

12:30.784 --> 12:32.217
two minutes,

12:32.252 --> 12:34.586
60 curl-ups
in two minutes,

12:34.621 --> 12:36.821
10 pull-ups
in two minutes,

12:36.857 --> 12:40.358
run four miles
with your pants and boots

12:40.393 --> 12:42.160
in 28 minutes,

12:42.195 --> 12:44.195
swim 1,000 yards...

12:44.231 --> 12:46.197
In--

12:46.233 --> 12:48.666
this is not interactive.

12:48.702 --> 12:49.534
No. I know.

12:49.569 --> 12:51.369
I just think
this might be a good time

12:51.404 --> 12:53.538
for me to mention
that I can't swim, so.

12:53.573 --> 12:56.007
We're the Navy seals.

12:56.042 --> 12:57.876
"Navy" means water.

12:57.911 --> 12:59.410
You have to swim.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.679
Right.
Well, I can't,

13:01.715 --> 13:02.914
so unless you want
to call your sister

13:02.949 --> 13:03.815
and let her know

13:03.850 --> 13:05.750
that I won't be
delivering my rewrite

13:05.786 --> 13:07.685
because I drowned...

13:09.256 --> 13:10.588
[Sighs]

13:10.624 --> 13:12.590
We'll find a workaround.

13:12.626 --> 13:13.758
Okay. Thanks.

13:13.794 --> 13:15.226
[Colin]: For now.

13:15.262 --> 13:17.295
[Barks]:
All right, tadpoles!

13:17.330 --> 13:19.931
Follow instructor lodell!

13:19.966 --> 13:21.566
He's gonna get
this party started.

13:21.601 --> 13:23.835
Let's move!

13:26.106 --> 13:28.206
[♪♪♪]

13:28.241 --> 13:29.407
[Ralph]: Move!

13:29.442 --> 13:30.909
You want me to run?

13:30.944 --> 13:32.143
Oh, yeah.

13:32.179 --> 13:33.745
Okay. Oh, could you guys
wait one sec?

13:33.780 --> 13:36.181
Here I come!

13:37.951 --> 13:38.883
[Sighs]

13:38.919 --> 13:41.085
Guys?

13:41.121 --> 13:42.821
[♪♪♪]

13:42.856 --> 13:44.556
As some of you know--

13:44.591 --> 13:47.559
behind me is a Navy seal
obstacle course.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.894
You'll be expected
to complete it in 12 minutes.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.162
Of course,
none of you will.

13:51.198 --> 13:54.065
But the journey of 1,000 miles
begins with the first step.

13:54.100 --> 13:56.100
This is your first step.

13:56.136 --> 13:57.602
Let's move.

13:57.637 --> 13:59.304
[Ralph, roars]: Move!

13:59.339 --> 14:02.640

[♪♪♪]

14:54.527 --> 14:56.527
You gotta be kidding me.

That wall represents
fear, payden.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.966
Okay.

Oops.

I'm just gonna...

15:07.207 --> 15:09.073
[Grunts]

15:09.109 --> 15:09.841
Next time.

15:09.876 --> 15:12.510
You must conquer it
to move ahead!

15:12.545 --> 15:14.012
Must you shout?

15:14.047 --> 15:15.847
[Bellows]:
I'm not shouting!

15:15.882 --> 15:17.849
This is my
"get it done" voice!

15:17.884 --> 15:19.417
Now get it done!

15:19.452 --> 15:23.721
Maybe you want me
to get you a cappuccino!

15:23.757 --> 15:25.323
Ralph? Americano?

15:25.358 --> 15:27.358
-What do you think?
-Extra-hot?

15:27.394 --> 15:28.826
Extra-hot!

15:37.570 --> 15:38.736
Congratulations.

15:38.772 --> 15:41.039
Today's spa day.
Get in the mud!

15:42.142 --> 15:43.274
Let's go!

15:43.310 --> 15:45.009
[Yelps apprehensively]

15:45.045 --> 15:46.811
Oh...

15:50.283 --> 15:53.084
This is hard.
I'm Jo, by the way.

15:53.119 --> 15:54.919
I'm focused.

15:54.955 --> 15:56.587
I can see that.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.523
I think you'll make
a very good recruit.

15:59.893 --> 16:02.627
You got time to talk,
you got time to walk.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.128
Team delta, give me
another mile and a half.

16:04.164 --> 16:06.130
What? No, no, no!
It wasn't them, it was me.

16:06.166 --> 16:07.532
Where you go, they go,
vice versa.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.133
That is not fair!

16:09.169 --> 16:11.803
Fair?
No one mentioned fair.

16:11.838 --> 16:13.972
Let's make it three miles.

16:14.007 --> 16:15.940
Way to go.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.744
You heard him.
Let's move! Move it! Move!

16:21.681 --> 16:23.681
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

16:27.787 --> 16:28.786
Oh!

16:28.822 --> 16:30.555
Hey, everybody.

16:32.692 --> 16:33.691
Um...

16:36.796 --> 16:38.496
Well, that's great.

16:38.531 --> 16:41.499
So my entire team
treats me like a pariah,

16:41.534 --> 16:43.267
I could barely
make it through

16:43.303 --> 16:45.970
one of the obstacles
on the obstacle course,

16:46.006 --> 16:47.171
and I can't really
feel my legs.

16:47.207 --> 16:49.841
So, you want to explain to me
what any of this has to do

16:49.876 --> 16:51.576
with me learning
about being a seal?

16:51.611 --> 16:53.578
You really need me
to spell it out for you?

16:53.613 --> 16:55.613
[Weary sigh] Apparently.

16:55.648 --> 16:56.981
Teamwork.

16:57.017 --> 16:59.584
Teamwork
is crucial for seals.

16:59.619 --> 17:01.619
The strengths of others
helps each of us,

17:01.654 --> 17:03.254
and you have to trust
the strength of those around you

17:03.289 --> 17:05.289
before you go
into any situation.

17:05.325 --> 17:06.858
But... you're a writer,

17:06.893 --> 17:08.192
so that'd
be hard for you.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.328
Uh, what's that
supposed to mean?

17:10.363 --> 17:11.762
Writers are solitary.

17:11.798 --> 17:12.730
That's not true,
'cause writers

17:12.766 --> 17:15.500
have to have a full team
of people around them

17:15.535 --> 17:16.701
to get their book published.

17:16.736 --> 17:18.202
And one of the reasons
i am in this mess

17:18.238 --> 17:20.471
is because my ex-editor
dropped the ball.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.473
So, it's the ex-editor's fault?

17:22.509 --> 17:24.675
[Chuckles] Wow.

17:24.711 --> 17:27.345
Uh, no, I said
one of the reasons.

17:27.380 --> 17:30.148
And you do realize what this
means for you, don't you?

17:31.684 --> 17:33.885
It means that you are now,
officially,

17:33.920 --> 17:35.486
on my team.

17:35.522 --> 17:37.955
Team <i> sealed with a kiss.</i>

17:37.991 --> 17:40.024
Please,
don't say that out loud.

17:40.060 --> 17:41.392
All right.
Well, at some point,

17:41.428 --> 17:44.462
I am gonna need to get
some non-cardio-induced

17:44.497 --> 17:45.496
information
from you, I guess.

17:45.532 --> 17:46.464
Fine.

17:46.499 --> 17:47.365
Fine.

17:49.569 --> 17:50.535
Ow.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.679
[Alarm starts beeping]

18:02.982 --> 18:04.482
[Gasps] Ow...

18:04.517 --> 18:05.950
[Whimpers]: Ow!

18:05.985 --> 18:06.984

18:08.755 --> 18:10.488

18:10.523 --> 18:12.423
Ow-w-w-w-w...

18:13.993 --> 18:15.860
Ow.

18:16.996 --> 18:18.896
[♪♪♪]

18:18.932 --> 18:19.897
Oh...

18:19.933 --> 18:21.866
Oh. Ow...

18:25.872 --> 18:27.538
All this from one day?

18:27.574 --> 18:28.739
Oh, you have no idea.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.374
I was so sore when
i woke up this morning,

18:30.410 --> 18:31.509
I could barely move.

18:31.544 --> 18:33.044
Thank you so much

18:33.079 --> 18:34.979
for coming over here
and saving me.

18:35.014 --> 18:37.982
How could I not?
You sounded so sad on the phone.

18:38.017 --> 18:38.950
I am sad.

18:38.985 --> 18:42.653
Besides, Charlie was
getting on my nerves.

18:42.689 --> 18:44.255
Oh! Has the bloom
already fallen

18:44.290 --> 18:45.990
from that
particular rose?

18:46.025 --> 18:47.892
A little wilty.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.362
When you were dating
the guy we don't talk about,

18:51.397 --> 18:53.264
did he go on and on

18:53.299 --> 18:55.099
about getting enough
billable hours?

18:55.135 --> 18:57.401
Oh, I mean, it's just
one of the many things

18:57.437 --> 18:59.670
that I do not miss.

18:59.706 --> 19:01.939
What do you miss?

19:01.975 --> 19:04.609
Honestly, I can't
think of a thing.

19:04.644 --> 19:05.877
Uh-huh.

19:05.912 --> 19:07.612
There has to be
something.

19:07.647 --> 19:08.613
You dated
for nearly a year.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.681
For you,
that is a record.

19:10.717 --> 19:13.417
Yeah, one I intend
to never break.

19:13.453 --> 19:14.519
Jo.

19:14.554 --> 19:15.620
Molly, please,

19:15.655 --> 19:17.622
I'm in enough pain as-is.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.757
Oh.

19:19.792 --> 19:20.858
Potassium tablets.

19:20.894 --> 19:21.726
Thank you.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.194
Don't forget to take
them tomorrow, too.

19:23.229 --> 19:25.129
The second day
is always worse.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.732
[Whimpers]: Oh.
Are you serious?

19:27.767 --> 19:29.200
Do you want me
to read back

19:29.235 --> 19:30.401
the last paragraph?

19:30.436 --> 19:31.802
Yes. That
would be great.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.137
If you could also do
all my typing...

19:33.173 --> 19:35.239
I think all my fingers
are bruised.

19:35.275 --> 19:36.240
Ha.

19:36.276 --> 19:39.243
This way I get to find out
what happens next.

19:40.947 --> 19:42.880
"He crouched behind a rock,

19:42.916 --> 19:45.416
"waiting for nightfall
before he made his next move.

19:45.451 --> 19:48.152
"Fear coursed through his veins,
but he tamped it down.

19:48.188 --> 19:49.620
With only his flashlight
to guide him he--"

19:49.656 --> 19:51.122
flashlight?

19:51.157 --> 19:52.590
What? How did you--?

19:52.625 --> 19:54.659
Why not have a klieg light,

19:54.694 --> 19:57.562
make it even easier
for the enemy to spot him?

19:57.597 --> 20:00.164
Or-- or, better yet, he should
stand up and announce,

20:00.200 --> 20:02.099
"love has made me stupid.

20:02.135 --> 20:03.100
"Please...

20:03.136 --> 20:04.569
Take me away."

20:04.604 --> 20:06.270
Molly, Colin.

20:06.306 --> 20:07.271
Colin, Molly.

20:07.307 --> 20:08.272
Hi.

20:08.308 --> 20:09.974
Hi, Molly.

20:10.009 --> 20:11.842
Do you know
what you don't do

20:11.878 --> 20:13.744
when you're behind
enemy territory at night

20:13.780 --> 20:15.079
and you're trying to escape
with your life?

20:16.549 --> 20:18.149
-Use a flashlight?
-Bingo!

20:18.184 --> 20:19.951
Molly, you make it
to the next round!

20:19.986 --> 20:21.052
You, however, do not.

20:23.223 --> 20:24.322
Where were you this morning?

20:24.357 --> 20:25.856
Um... mm,
lying around,

20:25.892 --> 20:27.692
groaning
in pain. Why?

20:27.727 --> 20:29.427
Because you were supposed
to be at bootcamp.

20:29.462 --> 20:32.163
You cannot honestly
expect me to be functional

20:32.198 --> 20:33.598
after yesterday.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.633
I can, and I do.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.802
We had team activities planned.

20:37.837 --> 20:40.605
Team delta was a woman short.

20:41.708 --> 20:43.274
Oh... oh, no.

20:43.309 --> 20:44.809
Oh, yes.

20:44.844 --> 20:46.477
Oh, do they
hate me?

20:46.512 --> 20:48.279
You're not their favorite.

20:48.314 --> 20:49.313
[Exhales, dejected]

20:49.349 --> 20:50.514
She can go
tomorrow, right?

20:50.550 --> 20:52.516
Wait a minute! You said
it was gonna be worse tomorrow,

20:52.552 --> 20:54.552
and I can barely walk today.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.020
[Colin]:
You should try this.

20:56.055 --> 20:58.522
It's protein powder,
amino acids, and minerals.

20:58.558 --> 21:00.291
And she's saved from tomorrow.

21:00.326 --> 21:01.959
We're under repair.
But the next day...

21:01.995 --> 21:03.995
Oh, she'll be there.

21:04.030 --> 21:06.330
Whose side are you on?

21:06.366 --> 21:08.799
You'll need to flush out
the toxins and stretch,

21:08.835 --> 21:10.735
and that means...

21:10.770 --> 21:11.636
Yoga.

21:11.671 --> 21:13.170
Yoga?

21:13.206 --> 21:14.672
Yeah, Molly teaches yoga.

21:14.707 --> 21:16.507
Vinyasa.
You ever tried it?

21:16.542 --> 21:17.808
[Chuckling]

21:17.844 --> 21:19.210
Yeah. Right.

21:19.245 --> 21:21.145
You're not
scared, are you?

21:22.248 --> 21:24.982
Afraid of yoga?

21:25.018 --> 21:27.885
Raise your right foot
into your left thigh...

21:29.389 --> 21:30.888
Hands into prayer.

21:32.358 --> 21:33.658
Deep breath in...

21:34.761 --> 21:35.693
And exhale.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.765
And release.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.067
Take hold of the inner-arch
of your right foot.

21:43.102 --> 21:45.536
Breathe in,
raise your left arm,

21:45.571 --> 21:47.171
and, as you exhale,

21:47.206 --> 21:49.740
lean forward...

21:49.776 --> 21:51.042
Kick your foot back,

21:51.077 --> 21:53.311
reach your heart
to the sky.

21:54.714 --> 21:56.614
How long
do I have to hold this?

21:56.649 --> 21:57.915
Two minutes.

21:59.886 --> 22:02.286
I'm never gonna need this
in the real world.

22:02.322 --> 22:03.421
Come on!

22:04.824 --> 22:06.390
Namaste.

22:07.727 --> 22:11.395
I feel so much better.
Thank you. That was fun.

22:11.431 --> 22:13.898
I don't think he shares
the same sentiment.

22:16.602 --> 22:18.636
[Hushed]: Yeah. That's
what makes it fun.

22:18.671 --> 22:21.472
[Chuckles] Glad I could
help you feel better.

22:21.507 --> 22:22.973
Bye, Colin!

22:23.009 --> 22:24.141
Yeah.

22:24.177 --> 22:25.409
Bye.

22:25.445 --> 22:27.611
So, what did you
think of yoga?

22:29.449 --> 22:30.414
Well, actually,

22:30.450 --> 22:32.883
I prefer my exercise to be
a bit more active.

22:32.919 --> 22:33.951
Well, you seemed
pretty active

22:33.986 --> 22:35.786
every time you tipped over.

22:37.190 --> 22:38.422
Ahem.

22:39.592 --> 22:41.592
[Chuckles] Colin.

22:41.627 --> 22:43.494
Hey, Colin, wait. Um...

22:43.529 --> 22:45.930
Do you have lunch plans?

22:45.965 --> 22:48.632
Why? You got some wheatgrass
and granola you want me to try?

22:48.668 --> 22:51.769
Ha-ha. No, but I do have
some questions about the seals

22:51.804 --> 22:52.703
that I'd love to ask you,

22:52.739 --> 22:54.939
if you're up for
a little writer-pestering.

22:56.042 --> 22:58.976
Okay.

22:59.011 --> 23:01.212
But on one condition.

23:06.986 --> 23:08.919
So much better than yoga.

23:08.955 --> 23:09.854
[Laughs]

23:09.889 --> 23:11.922
So you were telling me
about the mission.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.924
Right.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.760
Before a seal goes
on any mission,

23:15.795 --> 23:17.261
we prepare.

23:17.296 --> 23:18.696
And then we prepare
some more,

23:18.731 --> 23:20.097
and then we prepare again,

23:20.133 --> 23:22.299
until, when we go
wherever it is we're going,

23:22.335 --> 23:24.168
we already know so much
about what we're going to do,

23:24.203 --> 23:25.169
it seems old hat.

23:25.204 --> 23:27.271
But mistakes happen?

23:27.306 --> 23:28.305
All the time.

23:28.341 --> 23:29.507
Like with your Luke.

23:29.542 --> 23:32.376
Great! So what
i wrote is possible?

23:32.412 --> 23:34.311
Yes and no.

23:35.548 --> 23:37.715
Absolutely,
the helo could've crashed,

23:37.750 --> 23:38.883
but where you went wrong

23:38.918 --> 23:41.986
is having Luke's team leave
without searching for him.

23:42.021 --> 23:44.955
When you bond with someone,
you never leave them behind.

23:44.991 --> 23:47.458
Okay. I can fix that.
Short-term.

23:47.493 --> 23:48.959
But it's just, like,
Luke's character

23:48.995 --> 23:51.462
is so solitary
by nature, you know?

23:51.497 --> 23:53.197
You can bond
with your seal brothers

23:53.232 --> 23:54.465
and still be solitary.

23:56.102 --> 23:58.469
Would that describe you?

23:59.906 --> 24:01.639
I thought we were talking about
the characters in your book.

24:01.674 --> 24:02.740
Whoa.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.542
Characters are
just amalgamations

24:04.577 --> 24:06.076
of other people's stories,

24:06.112 --> 24:07.845
and every little bit helps,

24:07.880 --> 24:09.146
so...

24:09.182 --> 24:12.216
Okay. I-- I wouldn't
consider myself solitary

24:12.251 --> 24:15.553
as much as...
I'm always on the move.

24:15.588 --> 24:18.189
By yourself.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.992
Yes.

24:22.028 --> 24:23.594
Hmm.

24:23.629 --> 24:25.029
You know,
i read somewhere

24:25.064 --> 24:26.230
that some seals
have trouble

24:26.265 --> 24:27.731
adjusting
to civilian life.

24:27.767 --> 24:30.267
I guess that's true.

24:30.303 --> 24:32.269
But I've been retired
now for a few years,

24:32.305 --> 24:34.171
and I'm good.

24:34.207 --> 24:37.074
Yeah. But, you know,
you never stop moving.

24:37.109 --> 24:38.876
Old habits.

24:38.911 --> 24:40.511
Actually, I'm heading out
in a couple months

24:40.546 --> 24:43.447
to open up a new bootcamp
in Auckland, New Zealand.

24:43.483 --> 24:44.882
My first international venture.

24:44.917 --> 24:46.016
Wow!

24:46.052 --> 24:48.385
Congrats.
Was Mars not available?

24:48.421 --> 24:49.553
[Laughs]

24:49.589 --> 24:51.956
Yeah, it's far.

24:51.991 --> 24:54.758
But I am, uh, not tied down,
so why not?

24:57.497 --> 24:59.530
Yeah, sure.
I mean, makes sense.

24:59.565 --> 25:01.365
You'd actually have
to physically be in one place

25:01.400 --> 25:02.833
long enough
to get tied down.

25:05.137 --> 25:06.203
Are you gonna
finish the pizza?

25:06.239 --> 25:07.905
Oh, no.

25:07.940 --> 25:09.540
It's for Ralph.

25:09.575 --> 25:10.975
Okay.

25:11.010 --> 25:12.877
Thank you.

25:12.912 --> 25:14.645
Oh! Uh...

25:14.680 --> 25:16.313
Remember,
we're closed Monday,

25:16.349 --> 25:18.148
but Tuesday A.M.,
where will you be?

25:18.184 --> 25:20.551
Bootcamp, sir!
Bright and early.

25:20.586 --> 25:21.552
Hooyah!

25:21.587 --> 25:22.786
Okay. Gah!

25:24.257 --> 25:25.956
He says that so much.

25:28.361 --> 25:31.262
Well, if the goal is to make
every part of my body hurt?

25:31.297 --> 25:32.630
Progressing nicely.

25:32.665 --> 25:34.231
I meant with the rewrite.

25:34.267 --> 25:36.100
I know. Yeah, it is.
Actually, I'm learning a lot.

25:36.135 --> 25:37.268
Good!

25:37.303 --> 25:38.769
Because I am throwing
a prelaunch party

25:38.804 --> 25:39.803
for the book.

25:39.839 --> 25:41.405
Really? So soon?

25:41.440 --> 25:42.573
Well, we have
to do something

25:42.608 --> 25:43.908
to show that
we're behind this,

25:43.943 --> 25:45.643
behind you.

25:45.678 --> 25:47.811
All the critics who didn't
like <i> flames</i> will be there,

25:47.847 --> 25:48.979
so it's a sign of confidence.

25:49.015 --> 25:50.447
When?

25:50.483 --> 25:51.448
A couple of weeks.

25:51.484 --> 25:53.851
The earlier before the release,
the better.

25:53.886 --> 25:57.454
Shows confidence,
and it creates buzz.

25:57.490 --> 25:58.789
Mm. So you're bluffing?

25:58.824 --> 26:01.191
Hmm, only partially.

26:01.227 --> 26:05.129
I am confident
in your talent, Jo.

26:05.164 --> 26:07.431
Nobody can write romance
like you can,

26:07.466 --> 26:08.532
when you want to,

26:08.568 --> 26:10.968
but it's just that,
over these last couple of books,

26:11.003 --> 26:13.704
it's like
you've stopped believing in it.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.472
Of course,
i believe in romance!

26:15.508 --> 26:17.675
Come on! It's me!

26:17.710 --> 26:19.276
Hearts, flowers...

26:19.312 --> 26:21.645
You know, like...

26:21.681 --> 26:23.013
Blah, blah, blah.

26:23.049 --> 26:24.381
Mm. "Blah,
blah, blah."

26:24.417 --> 26:25.549
When was
the last time

26:25.585 --> 26:27.351
you seriously dated someone?

26:27.386 --> 26:29.386
Like, a couple years ago.

26:29.422 --> 26:31.655
Okay. Didn't you bring him
to a book-signing?

26:31.691 --> 26:32.556
Uh, "Todd"?

26:32.592 --> 26:34.658
Yeah, but I don't really
talk about him.

26:34.694 --> 26:36.293
Maybe you should.

26:37.530 --> 26:39.496
Is this turning into
a therapy session, Diana?

26:39.532 --> 26:40.631
No.

26:40.666 --> 26:41.665
It's just that
you would not be

26:41.701 --> 26:42.967
the first author
to get hurt

26:43.002 --> 26:44.201
and then hide
behind their writing.

26:44.236 --> 26:45.703
Jo, you're smart,

26:45.738 --> 26:47.338
you're creative,
and you're attractive,

26:47.373 --> 26:49.640
and it would be a real shame
if you did that.

26:49.675 --> 26:51.809
A shame for me,
or a shame for my writing?

26:51.844 --> 26:53.243
Both.

26:53.279 --> 26:54.745
Okay, I'll tell you what.

26:54.780 --> 26:55.846
I'll make you a deal.

26:55.881 --> 26:59.149
How about, first, I focus on
becoming a Navy seal--

26:59.185 --> 27:00.050
thanks for that, by the way--

27:00.086 --> 27:03.220
second, I finish my novel,
and then...

27:03.255 --> 27:04.822
I work on
my own personal romance?

27:04.857 --> 27:05.823
How's that?

27:05.858 --> 27:07.024
Deal.

27:07.059 --> 27:08.158
Great.

27:08.194 --> 27:09.893
Bye.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.666
[Exhales]

27:15.701 --> 27:17.635
[Under breath]: Okay.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.173
Hey, guys...

27:23.209 --> 27:25.075
Listen, um...

27:25.111 --> 27:27.277
I'm really sorry
about the other day.

27:27.313 --> 27:29.179
I promise--
it's not gonna happen again.

27:29.215 --> 27:30.080
You gotta understand.

27:30.116 --> 27:31.949
This is important to us.

27:31.984 --> 27:34.184
We're not just doing this
for book research.

27:35.421 --> 27:36.520
This is our life.

27:36.555 --> 27:38.055
I get it. I'm sorry.

27:38.090 --> 27:40.391
I promise I'll respect
your time in the future.

27:41.460 --> 27:43.460
Um, but, for now...

27:43.496 --> 27:45.896
How about just a little token?

27:45.931 --> 27:47.965
Flower.
That's for you.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.368
Orange--to bring out
the colors in your cheeks.

27:51.404 --> 27:52.403
Happy spring!

27:52.438 --> 27:53.470
You know?

27:53.506 --> 27:55.439
So... yeah!

27:56.575 --> 27:59.710
Go, team, right?

28:00.780 --> 28:01.912
Cool.

28:03.082 --> 28:06.183
[♪♪♪]

28:11.624 --> 28:13.223
Knock-knock!

28:14.360 --> 28:15.759
-Good morning!
-Morning.

28:17.496 --> 28:18.796
What is that?

28:18.831 --> 28:20.564
You may
recognize these.

28:20.599 --> 28:22.966
They are
called "flowers."

28:24.270 --> 28:26.470
This really isn't the place
for flowers.

28:26.505 --> 28:27.504
Why are they here?

28:27.540 --> 28:28.839
To brighten the place up!

28:28.874 --> 28:30.074
You know, when
things get tough,

28:30.109 --> 28:32.342
remind people that
spring has sprung.

28:32.378 --> 28:33.677
[Ralph]:
Oh, those are pretty!

28:33.713 --> 28:35.846
Gerbera daisies
are Lucy's favorite.

28:35.881 --> 28:36.980
[Jo]: What?
Who's Lucy?

28:37.016 --> 28:39.316
[Ralph]:
My wife. 20 years.

28:39.351 --> 28:40.551
This... [trails off]

28:41.887 --> 28:45.155
Saturday's our anniversary.

28:45.191 --> 28:46.790
You wouldn't happen to have
the flor--

28:46.826 --> 28:48.125
[exhales deeply]

28:48.160 --> 28:49.259
Thanks, Jo.

28:49.295 --> 28:50.194
You're welcome.

28:50.229 --> 28:52.763
Oh, boy.

28:52.798 --> 28:54.098
And...

28:54.133 --> 28:56.333
You are welcome.

29:04.543 --> 29:06.877
[Colin]:
The purpose of log pt--

29:06.912 --> 29:09.646
or "physical training"
for the newbie--

29:09.682 --> 29:12.549
is to build team cohesion.

29:12.585 --> 29:15.385
You're only as good
as your weakest member,

29:15.421 --> 29:17.654
so you want to make sure

29:17.690 --> 29:20.157
you have the right people
by your side.

29:22.361 --> 29:24.495
Keep it up!

29:27.366 --> 29:30.667
Okay, tiny, can you just maybe
lower your arms a little bit?

29:30.703 --> 29:33.804
The angle's really tough
from back here.

29:33.839 --> 29:35.506
If I do,
i can't lock my elbows.

29:35.541 --> 29:37.641
We just need
to outlast team Alpha, guys.

29:40.346 --> 29:41.645
I don't know how much longer
i can hold on.

29:41.680 --> 29:43.180
No, no, we can do this!
We can do this.

29:43.215 --> 29:44.515
Tiny, just slow
your breathing a little.

29:45.684 --> 29:46.884
How else am i
supposed to breathe?

29:46.919 --> 29:48.051
Try yoga breathing.

29:48.087 --> 29:49.720
Did she just say
"Yoda breathing"?

29:49.755 --> 29:52.055
<i> Yoga.</i> With a "g".

29:52.091 --> 29:54.324
You know, it's good
for when you're stressed out.

29:54.360 --> 29:56.026
You mean, like lamaze?

29:56.061 --> 29:57.227
Sorta.

29:57.263 --> 29:59.496
My sister has four kids.

29:59.532 --> 30:01.832
She says breathing
helps with the pain.

30:01.867 --> 30:02.833
I'll do anything.

30:02.868 --> 30:03.867
I'm in!

30:03.903 --> 30:05.669
Good. Take a deep breath,
in through the nose...

30:05.704 --> 30:07.070
[All inhaling]

30:07.106 --> 30:09.873
...and out through the mouth.
[Exhales]

30:09.909 --> 30:11.241
Again! Deep breath.

30:11.277 --> 30:13.210
In through the nose...

30:13.245 --> 30:14.344
Out through the mouth...

30:14.380 --> 30:15.879
Very good!

30:15.915 --> 30:17.514
In through your nose...

30:17.550 --> 30:18.615
[Breathing in unison]

30:18.651 --> 30:20.050
...and out through your mouth.

30:20.085 --> 30:22.252
She's got team delta
doing yoga breathing.

30:23.722 --> 30:25.589
<i> You</i> know
yoga breathing?

30:26.792 --> 30:28.225
Yeah. Kinda sorta.

30:28.260 --> 30:29.860
Kundalini
or bikram?

30:29.895 --> 30:31.728
Vin-something.

30:31.764 --> 30:32.763
Vinyasa.

30:32.798 --> 30:33.897
Yeah.

30:33.933 --> 30:35.566
Ahh. That stuff--

30:35.601 --> 30:37.801
[shouts]: No resting the log
on your heads!

30:37.837 --> 30:40.037
...really
helped my shoulder.

30:40.072 --> 30:41.638
See?

30:41.674 --> 30:43.040
How long have you
been doing it?

30:43.075 --> 30:44.241
A few years now.

30:44.276 --> 30:45.542
Lucy got me into it

30:45.578 --> 30:47.244
when my blood
pressure got--

30:47.279 --> 30:49.713
[Ralph, shouts]:
No slacking!

30:49.748 --> 30:50.881
...too high.

30:50.916 --> 30:53.083
Worked like a charm.

30:53.118 --> 30:55.118
How come you never
mentioned it before?

30:55.154 --> 30:57.487
Oh, thought
you'd laugh.

30:57.523 --> 31:00.257
You're right.

31:00.292 --> 31:01.792
[Team Alpha groaning intensely]

31:03.996 --> 31:06.296
All right, team Alpha is out!

31:06.332 --> 31:08.432
Which means, team delta,
you win!

31:08.467 --> 31:10.100
As your reward...

31:10.135 --> 31:12.302
You get to put the log down.

31:12.338 --> 31:13.637
[Relieved grunting]

31:13.672 --> 31:15.372
-Oh!
-Thank you.

31:16.642 --> 31:18.976
Alpha, delta,
don't get too comfortable.

31:19.011 --> 31:19.943
We're going
through the mud.

31:19.979 --> 31:20.944
Yeah!

31:20.980 --> 31:22.646
-Yeah!
-Team!

31:22.681 --> 31:24.948
Teams are good.

31:26.151 --> 31:28.652
Nice job.

31:30.689 --> 31:32.289
She's cute.

31:32.324 --> 31:33.457
Who's she?

31:33.492 --> 31:35.058
Annalise.

31:37.029 --> 31:38.462
We've been friends
since we were kids.

31:38.497 --> 31:40.430
Want to ask
her out, but...

31:40.466 --> 31:42.966
But...?

31:43.002 --> 31:45.369
She's just way
outta my league.

31:45.404 --> 31:47.471
[Laughing] Pj,
are you kidding me?

31:47.506 --> 31:49.940
I'm s-- I have
watched you

31:49.975 --> 31:51.708
scale a 13-foot wall

31:51.744 --> 31:53.777
like you were walking
up a stepladder.

31:53.812 --> 31:55.312
I watched you crawl
through a pit

31:55.347 --> 31:57.180
that was covered
in barbed wire

31:57.216 --> 31:58.282
like it was nothing.

31:58.317 --> 31:59.650
I cannot believe
you're afraid

31:59.685 --> 32:02.152
to ask out some girl.

32:02.187 --> 32:05.022
I mean...
Love's scary.

32:06.592 --> 32:08.225
Okay,
i have an idea.

32:08.260 --> 32:10.027
How about we come
up with a plan?

32:10.062 --> 32:12.562
We will call it...

32:12.598 --> 32:15.032
"Operation:
Ask out Annalise."

32:15.067 --> 32:17.634
[Both laughing]

32:17.670 --> 32:18.869
It'll be good.

32:18.904 --> 32:20.203
Okay, you got a deal.

32:20.239 --> 32:21.438
Okay, great.

32:23.342 --> 32:24.308
Hey.

32:24.343 --> 32:25.475
Oh, hey!

32:25.511 --> 32:26.810
I meant
to give you these earlier.

32:26.845 --> 32:28.245
What's that?

32:28.280 --> 32:29.546
My notes.

32:32.284 --> 32:33.817
Oh...

32:33.852 --> 32:36.386
No, Colin, this chapter
is all about Abby.

32:36.422 --> 32:37.821
Yeah. She's problematic.

32:37.856 --> 32:39.222
I'm sorry?

32:39.258 --> 32:40.724
She's way too much
of a dreamer

32:40.759 --> 32:41.825
in comparison to Luke,

32:41.860 --> 32:43.160
who, let's face it,

32:43.195 --> 32:45.195
is way too much of a realist
for her.

32:45.230 --> 32:47.197
I mean, she hasn't even
flown internationally.

32:47.232 --> 32:48.365
It's 2017.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.834
Why doesn't fly internationally?
I mean, even to Canada.

32:50.869 --> 32:53.103
Um... I haven't.

32:53.138 --> 32:54.404
What?

32:54.440 --> 32:55.739
What are you afraid of?

32:55.774 --> 32:58.342
I'm not afraid of anything.

32:58.377 --> 33:00.277
There just hasn't been
any need for me to go.

33:00.312 --> 33:01.511
Everything
that I could ever desire

33:01.547 --> 33:02.546
is right here,

33:02.581 --> 33:03.780
in the tri-state area.

33:03.816 --> 33:05.349
How do you know that?

33:05.384 --> 33:07.050
That's why people
go on adventures,

33:07.086 --> 33:09.453
to find things they never
knew were out there.

33:09.488 --> 33:10.587
I'll tell you what.

33:10.622 --> 33:12.055
I think it would be best

33:12.091 --> 33:14.358
if you just stuck
to your area of expertise.

33:14.393 --> 33:18.195
International travel
is my area of expertise.

33:18.230 --> 33:21.298
Well, writing romance novels
is mine, so.

33:21.333 --> 33:22.866
Tch.

33:24.136 --> 33:25.202
Okay, Colin, you know what?

33:25.237 --> 33:27.104
If I need your advice,
I'm gonna ask for it. Okay?

33:28.307 --> 33:30.507
Why do I doubt that?

33:40.753 --> 33:43.453
[♪♪♪]

33:48.794 --> 33:49.960
"We should
go out sometime."

33:49.995 --> 33:50.994
It's a little general.

33:51.030 --> 33:53.230
You don't want it to go
into the friend-zone.

33:53.265 --> 33:54.664
I would ask her out
to something really specific.

33:54.700 --> 33:55.899
Like what?

33:55.934 --> 33:57.100
Um...

33:57.136 --> 33:58.835
Like, what kind of stuff
does she like?

33:58.871 --> 34:00.437
She works for an airline,
so she's gone a lot.

34:00.472 --> 34:01.505
Mm-hmm.

34:01.540 --> 34:02.472
She mentioned that
she'd like to do

34:02.508 --> 34:03.907
a staycation

34:03.942 --> 34:05.675
and see stuff
she never gets to see.

34:05.711 --> 34:07.411
Ooh! What about, like,
the twilight ferry cruise?

34:07.446 --> 34:08.978
And then she can get
a view of the city,

34:09.014 --> 34:10.480
and it doesn't
break the bank.

34:10.516 --> 34:12.983
I like that!

34:15.219 --> 34:18.155
And, sometimes, it gets
a little cold on the boat,

34:18.190 --> 34:19.523
so you might just
have to snuggle.

34:19.558 --> 34:20.956
I really like that!

34:20.993 --> 34:22.125
Up top, payden!

34:27.632 --> 34:29.632
[Taking deep breaths]

34:29.668 --> 34:32.101
Okay. I got this.

34:32.137 --> 34:34.504
[♪♪♪]

34:37.009 --> 34:38.975
Eek! Oh.

34:41.679 --> 34:43.780
Oh...

34:45.818 --> 34:47.150
Next time.

34:47.186 --> 34:49.453
Ow. Okay.

34:49.487 --> 34:50.654
We need to talk
about your wardrobe.

34:50.688 --> 34:52.389
What's wrong with my style?

34:52.424 --> 34:54.824
Oh, you have so much to learn,
my little padawan.

34:54.860 --> 34:56.827
Really?

34:58.530 --> 35:00.564
Think they were
talking fashion.

35:00.599 --> 35:02.132
I think so.

35:07.506 --> 35:09.005
Hmm.

35:10.008 --> 35:10.874
So?

35:10.909 --> 35:13.243
I've always thought
you were talented.

35:13.278 --> 35:15.479
But...?

35:15.514 --> 35:17.681
But your details
are much stronger now.

35:17.716 --> 35:19.749
And Luke's struggle

35:19.785 --> 35:20.984
with being alone
versus loving Abby

35:21.019 --> 35:22.419
is believable.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.054
But...?

35:24.089 --> 35:25.055
I mean, I'm just sensing

35:25.090 --> 35:26.823
that there's, like,
another "but" in there,

35:26.859 --> 35:28.258
kind of lurking.

35:28.293 --> 35:30.994
I want more romance!

35:31.029 --> 35:32.929
Oh! I knew it!

35:32.965 --> 35:34.931
I have lost my romance mojo!

35:34.967 --> 35:36.900
-That's ridiculous.
-No! It's not!

35:36.935 --> 35:39.402
Diana says she thinks
I'm so burned out by love.

35:39.471 --> 35:41.538
That it's now
affecting my work. I...

35:41.573 --> 35:43.540
Can we talk about it now?

35:43.575 --> 35:46.443
Yes. Yes.

35:46.478 --> 35:48.378
I've got to figure this out.

35:48.413 --> 35:52.182
As your friend,
it's been hard to watch.

35:52.217 --> 35:55.152
Especially for a guy
who wasn't worth it.

35:57.723 --> 35:59.523
You guys
never laughed together.

35:59.558 --> 36:01.458
Well, yeah,
'cause he's not funny.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.393
[Laughs] He's so not funny.

36:04.897 --> 36:08.431
I guess I just want so badly
to have what my parents have.

36:08.467 --> 36:10.767
You know? Do you know
what my dad did for my mom,

36:10.802 --> 36:12.202
for her birthday last week?

36:12.237 --> 36:13.703
No, but I'm sure

36:13.739 --> 36:15.305
it set the bar
incredibly high--

36:15.340 --> 36:18.241
get this.
Hot-air balloon ride.

36:18.277 --> 36:20.377
A picnic.
All at sunset.

36:20.412 --> 36:22.279
I mean, so romantic.

36:22.314 --> 36:23.813
Do you know they still write
each other love notes

36:23.849 --> 36:25.115
after 30-plus years?

36:25.150 --> 36:27.250
See? This tells me

36:27.286 --> 36:30.253
you are the same romantic
you have always been.

36:30.289 --> 36:33.223
You just hold your parents
at such a high standard,

36:33.258 --> 36:35.258
that no one
can live up to that.

36:35.294 --> 36:37.394
Mm.

36:37.429 --> 36:38.662
Maybe. Maybe.

36:38.697 --> 36:40.830
No "maybe".
You know I'm right.

36:40.866 --> 36:45.435
Oh... it's your humility that
I've always found so endearing.

36:45.470 --> 36:46.469
Ha! [Scoffs]

36:46.505 --> 36:47.404
Okay, back to you.

36:47.439 --> 36:48.505
Oh.

36:48.540 --> 36:51.141
It's been two years
since Todd.

36:51.176 --> 36:52.576
-I know!
-It's enough.

36:52.611 --> 36:54.578
You have to give it
another try.

36:57.182 --> 36:58.748
Is there anyone
on the horizon?

37:01.653 --> 37:03.286
How about captain hottie?

37:03.322 --> 37:05.522
[Laughs]

37:05.557 --> 37:07.290
Please.

37:07.326 --> 37:08.491
And I mean, come--

37:08.527 --> 37:09.960
don't be delusional!

37:09.995 --> 37:11.361
Not an outright rejection.

37:11.396 --> 37:12.362
I'm sorry,

37:12.397 --> 37:15.265
I believe "delusional"
constitutes a rejection.

37:16.401 --> 37:18.602
Too bad.

37:18.637 --> 37:22.639
Because his name
is the first in years

37:22.674 --> 37:24.674
that has
made you light up.

37:27.012 --> 37:28.945
[Dismissive chuckle]

37:32.985 --> 37:35.785
[♪♪♪]

38:09.588 --> 38:11.288
There you go.
Thank you.

38:21.066 --> 38:23.800
Oh, I'll take one of those.
Thank you.

38:23.835 --> 38:25.802
I'm fine.
Thank you.

38:25.837 --> 38:26.870
Camo pants, huh?

38:26.905 --> 38:29.005
Yes. I thought
the military theme

38:29.041 --> 38:30.040
would put people
in the mood.

38:30.075 --> 38:31.675
No, it's a nice touch.

38:31.710 --> 38:33.209
Thank you.

38:33.245 --> 38:35.178
Lowell Bingley.

38:36.848 --> 38:38.748
Isn't he the critic
from the "Manhattan monitor"--

38:38.784 --> 38:40.650
-...who said--
...Called <i> flames...</i>

38:40.686 --> 38:42.485
..."blazingly inept"?
Uh-huh.

38:43.855 --> 38:45.355
Lowell!

38:45.390 --> 38:47.157
So good of you
to come.

38:47.192 --> 38:48.758
Oh. You've certainly
gone all out.

38:48.794 --> 38:49.893
Yes. Nothing,
but the best.

38:49.928 --> 38:51.161
Uh, speaking of,

38:51.196 --> 38:52.896
have you met
the lady of the moment?

38:52.931 --> 38:53.930
Josephine payden.

38:53.965 --> 38:55.065
Hello.

38:55.100 --> 38:57.000
I wasn't sure
you'd be here.

38:57.035 --> 38:59.369
Well... I am.

38:59.404 --> 39:03.206
We are all so excited
about <i> sealed with a kiss.</i>

39:03.241 --> 39:04.607
I gather, from the title,

39:04.643 --> 39:06.676
and from the way
the wait staff is dressed,

39:06.712 --> 39:09.846
that this latest love Tome
is military-themed?

39:09.881 --> 39:10.747
Yes. It is.

39:10.782 --> 39:11.848
Hmm.

39:11.883 --> 39:13.783
Is that a problem?

39:13.819 --> 39:15.352
My son is in the Navy.

39:15.387 --> 39:18.088
I don't really care to see
such an important institution

39:18.123 --> 39:21.958
reduced in
such a trivial arena.

39:21.993 --> 39:24.761
The romance genre
is the biggest-selling

39:24.796 --> 39:26.096
in all of fiction.

39:26.131 --> 39:27.464
I mean, it's worth billions.

39:27.499 --> 39:29.265
Not to mention,
we might have

39:29.301 --> 39:31.434
an opportunity to reach
tons of people

39:31.470 --> 39:34.204
who might not ever know
what Navy seals do.

39:34.239 --> 39:36.606
I mean,
that's hardly trivial.

39:36.641 --> 39:38.575
No one is disputing
the reach.

39:38.610 --> 39:41.211
It's the message
that worries me.

39:41.246 --> 39:42.812
You have my word

39:42.848 --> 39:45.548
that no other publishing house
or author

39:45.584 --> 39:47.617
will ever be more diligent
about making sure

39:47.652 --> 39:50.086
that Navy seals
are portrayed accurately

39:50.122 --> 39:51.755
and with
the utmost respect.

39:51.790 --> 39:53.156
Fair enough.

39:53.191 --> 39:54.891
But I will
be reading carefully,

39:54.926 --> 39:56.126
and any more mistakes...

39:56.161 --> 39:57.594
There'll be
no mistakes.

39:57.629 --> 39:59.996
...or superficial coverage,

40:00.031 --> 40:02.232
and, uh, I will
call you out.

40:02.267 --> 40:03.600
Again.

40:03.635 --> 40:06.002
Fair enough.

40:06.037 --> 40:07.270
Diana.

40:07.305 --> 40:08.838
Yes.

40:08.874 --> 40:10.907
Lowell.

40:10.942 --> 40:12.409
Nicely done.

40:12.444 --> 40:15.178
Now, only a dozen
or so more to go.

40:15.213 --> 40:17.347
Oh, I just saw
margo marcoux.

40:17.382 --> 40:19.082
She was absolutely
vicious about <i> flames.</i>

40:19.117 --> 40:20.083
Listen to me.

40:20.118 --> 40:21.017
Do not talk to her

40:21.052 --> 40:22.852
until I warm her up
with a chocolate eclair.

40:22.888 --> 40:23.820
No problem.

40:25.457 --> 40:27.724
Hi.

40:29.795 --> 40:31.594
Hello.

40:31.630 --> 40:33.329
Oh, there she is...

40:33.365 --> 40:35.331
The Princess who won't
fly internationally

40:35.367 --> 40:36.800
and can't swim.

40:36.835 --> 40:38.268
You know, it's
a real testament

40:38.303 --> 40:40.036
to how much I don't
want to be here

40:40.071 --> 40:42.272
that your company
is preferable to theirs.

40:42.307 --> 40:44.674
Plus, I am hardly
a Princess.

40:44.709 --> 40:46.976
Right now, you could
give Kate middleton

40:47.012 --> 40:48.278
a run for her money.

40:48.313 --> 40:49.679
It's so odd hearing
"Kate middleton"

40:49.714 --> 40:51.147
come out
of your mouth.

40:51.183 --> 40:53.216
Well, I had an ex
that was a royal-watcher.

40:53.251 --> 40:54.117
[Laughs]

40:54.152 --> 40:56.820
Yeah, and, yes,
our lack of compatibility

40:56.855 --> 40:58.621
was a big factor
in the break-up.

40:58.657 --> 41:00.290
I bet! [Chuckles]

41:00.325 --> 41:02.192
How long ago was that?

41:02.227 --> 41:04.861
Long enough for her
to get married and have kids.

41:04.896 --> 41:06.162
Oh. You miss her?

41:06.198 --> 41:07.197
Uh, I'm happy for her.

41:07.232 --> 41:09.833
She got exactly what she wanted,
to settle down.

41:09.868 --> 41:11.234
Is that what you want?

41:11.269 --> 41:14.070
I was on active duty.
It wasn't an option.

41:14.105 --> 41:16.306
But, I mean,
you're retired now,

41:16.341 --> 41:17.540
so it is...

41:17.576 --> 41:19.142
Isn't it?

41:19.177 --> 41:21.711
Do you two not spend
enough time together?

41:21.746 --> 41:23.713
Oh, not with me
all gussied up

41:23.748 --> 41:25.582
and her dazzled
by my beauty.

41:25.617 --> 41:27.217
[Diana]: Oh! Yes,
you do look pretty.

41:27.252 --> 41:29.018
And speaking of which,

41:29.054 --> 41:30.320
we are gonna
shoot the cover next week,

41:30.355 --> 41:32.021
so I will send you
all the details,

41:32.057 --> 41:33.690
if you would like to join me
here at my house.

41:33.725 --> 41:34.691
Yes, absolutely.

41:34.726 --> 41:35.825
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

41:35.861 --> 41:36.759
Please tell me
you at least got a guy

41:36.795 --> 41:38.394
who looks like
he is military

41:38.430 --> 41:40.930
and not just
been going to the gym.

41:40.966 --> 41:43.166
Before we get into
that always-fun topic,

41:43.201 --> 41:44.200
I do want to make sure

41:44.236 --> 41:46.002
that my author is not hiding

41:46.037 --> 41:48.371
from the very people
she's here to win over.

41:49.574 --> 41:51.541
Yeah. Excuse us.

41:52.878 --> 41:54.844
Good luck, Princess.

42:00.318 --> 42:03.686
Oh, absolutely.
Yes. So true.

42:07.993 --> 42:09.158
I'm sure it will be fine.

42:13.398 --> 42:17.400
[♪♪♪]

42:17.435 --> 42:18.434
[Diana]: Once again,

42:18.470 --> 42:20.403
I want to thank you all
for coming here today.

42:20.438 --> 42:22.605
I believe
that we have a special book

42:22.641 --> 42:23.873
from a special author,

42:23.909 --> 42:28.111
and it happens to be in an arena
that is very dear to my heart.

42:28.146 --> 42:29.245
You might not know this,

42:29.281 --> 42:31.281
but my brother, Colin,

42:31.316 --> 42:34.284
is a highly-decorated Navy seal,
<i> and...</i>

42:34.319 --> 42:36.986
He has been
a consultant on this book.

42:37.022 --> 42:38.955
I also want you to know

42:38.990 --> 42:40.290
that Josephine payden

42:40.325 --> 42:42.058
has been so dedicated

42:42.093 --> 42:43.793
to making sure
that her story reflects

42:43.828 --> 42:45.261
the truth of seal life,

42:45.297 --> 42:46.563
that she has been

42:46.598 --> 42:50.066
training for weeks
with actual recruits.

42:50.101 --> 42:51.301
So, please...

42:51.336 --> 42:53.436
Let's take a moment
and thank

42:53.471 --> 42:57.006
our very brave men and women
of the U.S. military.

42:57.042 --> 42:58.408
Thank you.

43:02.047 --> 43:05.081
And I cannot wait for you all
to read <i> sealed with a kiss!</i>

43:05.116 --> 43:06.583
Thank you so much!

43:07.986 --> 43:10.153
[Colin]: You weren't
supposed to do that.

43:10.188 --> 43:11.654
And I hope
you enjoy the book.

43:23.335 --> 43:25.301
Leaving so soon?

43:25.337 --> 43:27.337
I just spent hours

43:27.372 --> 43:29.272
playing nice with
my harshest critics.

43:29.307 --> 43:30.673
I deserve a medal.

43:30.709 --> 43:33.109
Yeah, you did go
above and beyond.

43:33.144 --> 43:36.312
Oh? Were you
watching?

43:36.348 --> 43:38.114
Maybe.

43:38.149 --> 43:40.116
And, uh... [sighs]

43:40.151 --> 43:41.484
About earlier,

43:41.519 --> 43:43.853
when I gave you notes
on Abby,

43:43.888 --> 43:45.688
I might have been...

43:45.724 --> 43:47.957
You know... wrong.

43:47.993 --> 43:51.060
Oh. I'm so sorry.
What was that?

43:51.096 --> 43:52.862
I was wrong.

43:52.897 --> 43:55.198
Mm. That's what
i thought you said.

43:55.233 --> 43:57.300
Bye.

43:57.335 --> 43:59.969
[♪♪♪]

44:06.444 --> 44:08.811
What's going on
with you and Jo?

44:10.048 --> 44:12.582
We're just working together,
like you asked.

44:12.617 --> 44:14.684
Mm. So, i-I'm just imagining

44:14.719 --> 44:16.819
the flirtation
between the two of you?

44:16.855 --> 44:18.755
Absolutely.

44:18.790 --> 44:21.524
It's just an interaction
between colleagues.

44:21.559 --> 44:23.026
I'm gonna hold you to that,

44:23.061 --> 44:25.762
because I cannot have
one of my biggest authors

44:25.797 --> 44:27.030
distracted
at this critical time.

44:27.065 --> 44:28.064
Am I clear?

44:28.099 --> 44:29.232
Yes, ma'am.

44:29.267 --> 44:30.900
That's not funny,
Colin, I'm serious.

44:30.935 --> 44:33.503
She needs to focus
on that rewrite.

44:33.538 --> 44:34.570
Besides, you're leaving town.

44:34.606 --> 44:35.805
You're going to place

44:35.840 --> 44:38.875
that doesn't exactly encourage
long-distance relationships.

44:38.910 --> 44:40.176
Down-shift, sis.

44:40.211 --> 44:41.878
Jo and I are not
in a relationship.

44:41.913 --> 44:43.012
Good.

44:43.048 --> 44:46.015
Because she has a lot riding
on getting this book right.

44:46.051 --> 44:46.983
We all do.

44:54.259 --> 44:55.558
Gorgeous.
You look fabulous.

44:55.593 --> 44:59.062
[♪♪♪]

44:59.097 --> 45:00.396
You're gorgeous.

45:00.432 --> 45:01.564
Beautiful!

45:01.599 --> 45:03.166
[♪♪♪]

45:03.201 --> 45:04.634
[Jo]: It's gonna look good.

45:04.669 --> 45:05.635
I think so.
It's just the hair.

45:05.670 --> 45:06.936
-That one side looks--
-yeah.

45:06.971 --> 45:07.937
Ooh.

45:07.972 --> 45:08.938
Wait. You're here.

45:08.973 --> 45:09.939
Well, I had to check out

45:09.974 --> 45:11.607
what version of fabio
you guys came up with.

45:11.643 --> 45:13.509
Yeah. Ridiculous.

45:13.545 --> 45:15.978
He's not even wearing
the right uniform!

45:16.014 --> 45:17.980
That's for the marines,
not Navy!

45:18.016 --> 45:19.482
[Jo]: Oh, my gosh.
He's right.

45:19.517 --> 45:20.817
How did we not see this?

45:20.852 --> 45:22.285
Well, they're
very similar.

45:22.320 --> 45:23.653
Not to the trained eye.

45:23.688 --> 45:25.955
Excuse me! Do we have
a Navy uniform?

45:27.459 --> 45:28.925
That's all that I got.

45:28.960 --> 45:30.293
Does it matter?

45:30.328 --> 45:32.261
[In unison]: Yes!

45:32.297 --> 45:33.329
All right, we're gonna
take a break.

45:33.364 --> 45:35.631
[Diana sighs]

45:36.801 --> 45:38.501
This is a disaster.

45:38.536 --> 45:40.002
How am I going to find
a Navy uniform?

45:40.038 --> 45:41.104
Well, I have
one in my car,

45:41.139 --> 45:43.473
but it's never
gonna fit that guy.

45:43.508 --> 45:45.007
You could wear it.

45:45.043 --> 45:47.276
Of course, I could wear it,
it's mine.

45:47.312 --> 45:49.278
No...

45:49.314 --> 45:50.246
I'm saying...

45:51.382 --> 45:53.516
<i>You</i> could wear it.

45:55.854 --> 45:57.120
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

45:57.155 --> 45:58.521
It's not gonna happen.

45:58.556 --> 45:59.455
That's a great idea.

45:59.491 --> 46:00.790
It's a terrible idea, d.

46:00.825 --> 46:02.058
You say yourself,

46:02.093 --> 46:04.060
that these big
book-cover models,

46:04.095 --> 46:05.661
they don't look
like real military.

46:05.697 --> 46:07.296
Well, you are real military.

46:07.332 --> 46:08.464
Reschedule.

46:08.500 --> 46:09.499
We don't have
enough time.

46:09.534 --> 46:10.666
Stock footage.

46:10.702 --> 46:12.702
It's just gonna end up being
some version of this guy--

46:12.737 --> 46:13.703
who, you're right,

46:13.738 --> 46:16.706
doesn't capture the essence
of a Navy seal.

46:16.741 --> 46:18.541
But you do.

46:21.112 --> 46:22.378
She's right.

46:23.414 --> 46:24.814
No.

46:24.849 --> 46:26.516
Please?

46:27.585 --> 46:28.484
No.

46:28.520 --> 46:31.287
[♪♪♪]

46:40.799 --> 46:42.532
All right, all right, stop.

46:48.740 --> 46:50.706
Wow.

46:52.911 --> 46:54.377
It's okay...

46:54.412 --> 46:55.745
You kidding me?

46:55.780 --> 46:57.013
No.

46:57.048 --> 46:58.447
Not the lips.

46:58.483 --> 46:59.549
Now...

46:59.584 --> 47:00.716
Look at me.

47:02.053 --> 47:04.253
Chin down.

47:04.289 --> 47:06.556
Oh, he's just
not comfortable.

47:06.591 --> 47:07.623
Yeah, I know,

47:07.659 --> 47:08.758
but it's just
his first time

47:08.793 --> 47:09.692
doing one
of these things.

47:09.727 --> 47:11.661
Which is irrelevant
to the finished product.

47:18.069 --> 47:19.802
He's so handsome.
It'll work.

47:19.838 --> 47:21.704
Handsome?

47:21.739 --> 47:23.940
Yeah, you know,
objectively.

47:23.975 --> 47:25.708
Speaking as
an outside observer.

47:25.743 --> 47:27.410
You know, it's really
more of a compliment

47:27.445 --> 47:28.945
to your gene pool,

47:28.980 --> 47:31.647
so congrats
to your mom.

47:31.683 --> 47:32.815
Not that
you're handsome.

47:32.851 --> 47:34.150
It's just that, um...

47:34.185 --> 47:35.651
[Diana]: Jo,

47:35.687 --> 47:37.153
listen.

47:37.188 --> 47:38.788
Now, when I spoke
to you earlier, about dating,

47:38.823 --> 47:39.722
what I was actually meaning--

47:39.757 --> 47:41.390
-...was after the book is done.
-Right.

47:41.426 --> 47:42.325
Just because you don't
want to be distracted--

47:42.360 --> 47:44.293
what's she
doing to him?

47:46.865 --> 47:49.565
[Sighs]

47:49.601 --> 47:50.666
What are you doing?

47:50.702 --> 47:52.501
Unbuttoning your jacket
so we can see your chest.

47:52.537 --> 47:53.569
For what?

47:53.605 --> 47:55.071
So that it looks--

47:55.106 --> 47:57.173
no, we're not doing that.
Absolutely not.

47:57.208 --> 47:58.774
Thank you.
Thank you.

47:58.810 --> 47:59.675
I got it.
Thanks so much.

47:59.711 --> 48:00.776
Sure.

48:00.812 --> 48:01.811
You're doing
a great job.

48:01.846 --> 48:02.745
No problem.
I'll just go.

48:02.780 --> 48:03.746
I'm so sorry.

48:03.781 --> 48:06.315
I'm sorry. Here.

48:06.351 --> 48:08.417
Thank you.

48:23.401 --> 48:25.134
Okay.
Think we're...

48:25.169 --> 48:27.336
You can
keep going. Okay.

48:29.007 --> 48:31.674
[♪♪♪]

48:32.810 --> 48:34.443
So, that was...

48:34.479 --> 48:35.678
Awful.

48:35.713 --> 48:37.947
A learning experience?
[Chuckles]

48:37.982 --> 48:39.482
The photographer
is really happy.

48:39.517 --> 48:40.650
She is?

48:40.685 --> 48:42.685
Yeah, she said
she got some great shots.

48:42.720 --> 48:43.886
I can't see how.

48:43.922 --> 48:45.187
Oh, well, you can
do a lot these days

48:45.223 --> 48:46.989
with filters,
processing.

48:47.025 --> 48:48.391
[Laughs]

48:48.426 --> 48:50.526
Um, I saw this little
place up the road,

48:50.561 --> 48:51.961
if you want to go,
grab a bite.

48:51.996 --> 48:54.497
You know, just...
Talk seals?

48:54.532 --> 48:56.032
Hooyah.

48:56.067 --> 48:57.867
Great. Um, I'm just
gonna grab my stuff.

48:57.902 --> 48:58.868
I'll meet you out front?

48:58.903 --> 48:59.869
Okay. I'll drive.

48:59.904 --> 49:01.804
We'll take two cars.

49:04.943 --> 49:06.542
Thank you.

49:06.577 --> 49:09.078
So why did you want
to be a Navy seal?

49:09.113 --> 49:11.047
I wanted
to protect people.

49:11.082 --> 49:13.182
From what?

49:13.217 --> 49:15.718
When I was 10 years old,
my parents passed.

49:15.753 --> 49:16.986
Oh, I'm sorry.

49:17.021 --> 49:18.721
Yeah.

49:18.756 --> 49:20.890
Diana had just
graduated from college,

49:20.925 --> 49:22.091
so you can imagine

49:22.126 --> 49:24.560
the idea of raising
her little brother

49:24.595 --> 49:27.663
wasn't exactly what
she envisioned for her life.

49:27.699 --> 49:28.931
But she did it.

49:28.967 --> 49:30.533
That's why you two
are so close.

49:30.568 --> 49:32.935
I owe everything to her.

49:32.971 --> 49:34.537
And I wasn't
the easiest kid to raise.

49:34.572 --> 49:36.906
I got into some trouble
when I was a teenager.

49:36.941 --> 49:38.741
'Kay, it wasn't
anything serious,

49:38.776 --> 49:40.276
but it was enough
for d to suggest

49:40.311 --> 49:42.345
the high school's r.O.T.C.,

49:42.380 --> 49:44.046
for some discipline.

49:44.082 --> 49:46.415
Right. And was it
love at first sight?

49:46.484 --> 49:49.251
Mm! Hardly.

49:49.287 --> 49:51.454
But... when
it got there,

49:51.489 --> 49:53.255
it stuck.

49:53.291 --> 49:54.423
Especially
when I realized

49:54.459 --> 49:56.025
I could save people.

49:56.060 --> 49:57.293
Ah...

49:57.328 --> 50:00.229
So, you know, what now?

50:00.264 --> 50:02.198
-Now?
-Well, yeah.

50:02.233 --> 50:03.299
You're retired.

50:03.334 --> 50:05.034
What does superman do
once he's hung up his cape?

50:06.237 --> 50:07.169
He starts schools

50:07.205 --> 50:08.938
for other would-be superheroes,
of course.

50:08.973 --> 50:10.139
No, seriously.

50:10.174 --> 50:11.707
It's something
i had planned.

50:11.743 --> 50:13.909
Get into the seals,
retire,

50:13.945 --> 50:15.811
and then start bootcamps.

50:15.847 --> 50:17.213
That's great.

50:19.951 --> 50:21.117
So, do any, um...

50:21.152 --> 50:23.652
Missions really
pop in your mind?

50:23.688 --> 50:26.155
Like, when
you think back?

50:26.190 --> 50:28.190
Kenya. 2008.

50:29.360 --> 50:31.460
Six missionaries
were captured by pirates.

50:31.496 --> 50:32.661
They were held at sea,

50:32.697 --> 50:34.830
so they called us in
to extract them.

50:34.866 --> 50:37.900
James, who was
one of the people rescued,

50:37.935 --> 50:41.103
he had a wife
who was nine months pregnant,

50:41.139 --> 50:42.772
and seeing them
reunited

50:42.807 --> 50:45.007
was the most
amazing feeling.

50:45.043 --> 50:46.642
I bet.

50:46.677 --> 50:48.644
And that's when you earned
your silver star, right?

50:48.679 --> 50:49.645
Oh, look at you,

50:49.680 --> 50:50.479
you did do research.

50:50.515 --> 50:52.915
I told you,
i always do research.

50:52.950 --> 50:53.983
But seriously,

50:54.018 --> 50:55.284
a silver star
is a big deal.

50:55.319 --> 50:56.852
You should
be very proud.

50:56.888 --> 50:58.687
I think medals
are for trackmeets,

50:58.723 --> 51:01.690
but it is important
to recognize the sacrifices

51:01.726 --> 51:03.492
that the Navy seals make.

51:03.528 --> 51:06.629
Yeah. I bet Diana
was super-proud.

51:06.664 --> 51:08.431
Oh, she was.

51:09.801 --> 51:10.966
You two
are really sweet.

51:11.002 --> 51:13.035
Makes me kinda wish
i had a sibling.

51:13.071 --> 51:14.837
I mean, Molly is sort of
like a sister to me,

51:14.872 --> 51:15.838
but it's, like, every time

51:15.873 --> 51:17.006
she starts dating
a new guy,

51:17.041 --> 51:18.674
she sort of disappears.

51:18.709 --> 51:20.142
Is that what you're like
when you date?

51:20.178 --> 51:22.344
Disappear?

51:22.380 --> 51:24.346
No.

51:24.382 --> 51:26.649
No. But Molly says

51:26.684 --> 51:29.285
that's because I'm never
really into the guy.

51:29.320 --> 51:30.486
Never?

51:30.521 --> 51:31.854
Well...

51:31.889 --> 51:34.690
There was
this one guy. Todd.

51:34.725 --> 51:35.624
We dated
for, like, a year.

51:35.660 --> 51:37.460
Until?

51:37.495 --> 51:38.427
Until...

51:38.463 --> 51:40.529
I found out
that I was not the only person

51:40.565 --> 51:42.565
he was dating at the time.

51:42.600 --> 51:43.866
I'm sorry.

51:43.901 --> 51:45.334
Yeah.

51:45.369 --> 51:46.502
Were you hurt badly?

51:47.672 --> 51:49.405
I thought I was.

51:49.440 --> 51:52.741
But, actually, I think I was
just using him to hide behind,

51:52.777 --> 51:54.410
you know,
kind of like a shield.

51:54.445 --> 51:56.011
It's just...

51:56.047 --> 51:58.280
I want fireworks.

51:59.417 --> 52:01.884
Like I write about.

52:01.919 --> 52:03.319
And I want that,
and I don't think

52:03.354 --> 52:05.087
that I should
have to compromise.

52:05.123 --> 52:06.856
No. You shouldn't have to.

52:06.891 --> 52:08.691
Thank you.

52:08.726 --> 52:10.392
And there's, um...

52:10.428 --> 52:11.160
One other thing
that I don't think

52:11.195 --> 52:13.162
you should have
to compromise on.

52:13.197 --> 52:14.563
What's that?

52:14.599 --> 52:16.866
Saturday afternoon,
at 3:00...

52:16.901 --> 52:17.933
Uh-huh?

52:17.969 --> 52:19.168
I would like it
if you would meet me

52:19.203 --> 52:20.836
at the community pool.

52:20.872 --> 52:21.937
Oh, no...

52:21.973 --> 52:22.938
Oh, yes.

52:22.974 --> 52:23.939
No. I can't.

52:23.975 --> 52:24.974
Okay, Jo.

52:25.009 --> 52:29.445
I posed in front of strangers
with makeup on.

52:29.480 --> 52:31.213
Yeah. You can do this.

52:42.193 --> 52:43.826
I don't suppose

52:43.861 --> 52:44.793
the first lesson could be

52:44.829 --> 52:47.263
more of, like,
a visualization-type thing?

52:47.298 --> 52:49.331
Well, that's
excellent mental tool,

52:49.367 --> 52:51.000
one I use myself,

52:51.035 --> 52:53.102
but you're gonna
have to get in the water.

52:53.137 --> 52:55.137
Well, at least, you know,
turn around.

52:55.173 --> 52:56.138
Close your eyes.

52:56.174 --> 52:58.707
Okay, just, um...

52:58.743 --> 53:01.343
Take my hand,
I'll guide you into the water.

53:02.580 --> 53:03.512
You know, I just want
to point out

53:03.548 --> 53:05.481
that this should show you
how dedicated I am

53:05.516 --> 53:07.683
to getting the details accurate
in the story.

53:07.718 --> 53:08.751
I-i can see that.

53:08.786 --> 53:11.554
Well, not literally,
because my eyes are closed,

53:11.589 --> 53:13.856
but you've gone
above and beyond.

53:13.891 --> 53:15.357

53:15.393 --> 53:17.193
Now, Jo? Take my hand.

53:31.909 --> 53:33.375
One step
at a time. Good.

53:33.411 --> 53:35.711
All right, can I open my eyes?

53:35.746 --> 53:37.546
Uh, yeah.

53:38.683 --> 53:40.182
You're in the water.

53:40.218 --> 53:41.717
Mm-hmm.

53:44.222 --> 53:45.354
[Exhales] Okay!

53:45.389 --> 53:46.589
That's enough
for the first lesson.

53:46.624 --> 53:48.190
No. No.

53:50.261 --> 53:51.260
Are you scared?

53:51.295 --> 53:54.563
Um, no, just, you know,
a little apprehensive,

53:54.599 --> 53:56.098
when you try something new.

53:56.133 --> 53:57.900
It's like that
for most people,

53:57.935 --> 53:59.101
the first time
they try anything.

53:59.136 --> 54:00.703
Yeah.

54:00.738 --> 54:03.272
Of course, you could always
just not try things.

54:03.307 --> 54:04.473
Well, then
you'd be avoiding life,

54:04.508 --> 54:06.775
and you don't want to avoid
your life, now, do you, Jo?

54:06.811 --> 54:08.877
Only the scary parts.

54:08.913 --> 54:10.512
[Chuckles]

54:10.548 --> 54:11.880
Ahem.

54:11.916 --> 54:13.749
So I don't suppose
the pools are this warm

54:13.784 --> 54:15.951
when you do
all your seal training?

54:15.987 --> 54:17.519
No. Not even close.

54:17.555 --> 54:20.623
We'd have to tread water
for hours, in a circle,

54:20.658 --> 54:22.691
passing weights
to each other.

54:22.727 --> 54:24.593
It's to build stamina.

54:24.629 --> 54:27.363
I think
I'll skip that lesson.

54:27.398 --> 54:29.765
So how come
you never learned how to swim?

54:29.800 --> 54:31.400
Uh, have you
heard of the term

54:31.435 --> 54:33.035
"absent-minded
professor"?

54:33.070 --> 54:34.937
Well, I had two of those
for parents.

54:34.972 --> 54:38.407
And don't get me wrong,
they're great, they're great.

54:38.442 --> 54:41.076
But sometimes they'd get
so caught up in academia,

54:41.112 --> 54:44.280
that they'd forget to teach me
sort of basic parenting things.

54:44.315 --> 54:45.381
Like swimming?

54:45.416 --> 54:46.348
Yeah, like swimming.

54:46.384 --> 54:48.917
But it's okay,
it's why I became a writer.

54:48.953 --> 54:51.053
They would be so involved
with their math problems,

54:51.088 --> 54:52.955
that I would just throw myself
into books,

54:52.990 --> 54:55.424
and I would create
whole new worlds in my mind,

54:55.459 --> 54:57.793
and then, eventually,
i put it in my novels.

54:57.828 --> 55:00.329
And you made me tell that story
to distract me,

55:00.364 --> 55:01.563
to get me into the deep end?

55:01.599 --> 55:03.432
-Didn't you?
-Yeah. And it worked.

55:03.467 --> 55:05.334
It sure did.

55:05.369 --> 55:06.735
Okay...

55:06.771 --> 55:08.070
You all right?

55:08.105 --> 55:11.040
Yeah, I feel...
You know, wet, but fine.

55:13.477 --> 55:16.011
Okay. What's next?

55:16.047 --> 55:18.280
Floating.

55:18.316 --> 55:19.415
Floating?

55:19.450 --> 55:20.449
You can do this.

55:20.484 --> 55:21.784
Do you trust me?

55:23.054 --> 55:24.486
Yeah.

55:24.522 --> 55:25.487
Don't let go.

55:25.523 --> 55:26.455
I won't let go.

55:26.490 --> 55:27.523
Don't let go.

55:27.558 --> 55:28.957
I won't. I want you
to lean back.

55:28.993 --> 55:30.092
Okay.

55:30.127 --> 55:31.660
Breathe nice and easy.

55:31.696 --> 55:32.628
Okay, don't--
don't let go.

55:32.663 --> 55:34.196
I won't, I won't.

55:34.231 --> 55:35.431
When you're ready,
you let go.

55:35.466 --> 55:36.632
Okay.

55:36.667 --> 55:38.033
All right.

55:38.069 --> 55:39.268
Good!
Good, good, good, good.

55:39.303 --> 55:40.336
Okay.

55:40.371 --> 55:42.938
I got you.
Just relax.

55:44.308 --> 55:45.941
Nice and easy.

55:45.976 --> 55:48.444
Breathing,
breathing, and...

55:48.479 --> 55:50.512
You're doing it!

55:50.548 --> 55:52.648
Great job!

55:52.683 --> 55:53.782
That's fantastic.

55:53.818 --> 55:54.783
[Doors bang]

55:54.819 --> 55:55.751
[Yelps]

55:56.854 --> 55:58.354
It's okay,
it's okay.

55:58.389 --> 55:59.722
It's okay,
i got you.

55:59.757 --> 56:00.789
You're safe.

56:00.825 --> 56:02.858
[♪♪♪]

56:05.329 --> 56:09.798
I think maybe that's
enough for one day.

56:09.834 --> 56:12.101
Yeah. Yeah.

56:14.505 --> 56:15.904
I got you.

56:15.940 --> 56:16.972
You got me?

56:17.007 --> 56:18.574
-I got you.
-Okay.

56:18.609 --> 56:21.176
How did you not kiss him
in that moment?

56:21.212 --> 56:23.379
I don't know! I just--
i got flustered, 'Kay, Molly?

56:23.414 --> 56:25.414
Yeah. Because you like him.

56:25.449 --> 56:28.550
Fine. All right?
I like him.

56:28.586 --> 56:30.085
But it really doesn't matter,

56:30.121 --> 56:31.487
because Colin's
gonna be gone in a month,

56:31.522 --> 56:34.356
and, plus,
he's my boss's brother.

56:34.392 --> 56:36.024
So what are you gonna do?

56:36.060 --> 56:38.360
The only thing I can do--

56:38.396 --> 56:40.996
throw myself into work
and ignore the whole thing.

56:41.031 --> 56:42.431
Yeah, that's healthy.

56:42.466 --> 56:43.866
Look, it's all gonna
be over in a month.

56:43.901 --> 56:45.200
My book's gonna be published.

56:45.236 --> 56:47.403
Colin gonna's be in New Zealand,

56:47.438 --> 56:49.204
and I'm just gonna be here.

56:49.240 --> 56:50.806
Like I always am.

56:52.276 --> 56:53.742
Unless you go to New Zealand.

56:53.778 --> 56:55.043
Your laptop
is portable.

56:55.079 --> 56:56.845
You can write
from anywhere.

56:56.881 --> 56:58.380
I think we're getting
ahead of ourselves.

56:58.416 --> 57:00.015
We haven't even kissed yet.

57:00.050 --> 57:01.817
"Yet"?

57:03.454 --> 57:05.888
I'm gonna go work
on the Luke and Abby reunion.

57:07.458 --> 57:08.924
I bet <i> they</i> kiss.

57:08.959 --> 57:10.359
I'm over you.

57:11.962 --> 57:14.029
Tch. [Sighs]

57:15.733 --> 57:17.900
[Deep breath]

57:17.935 --> 57:19.401
[Sighs]

57:20.771 --> 57:22.771
[Giggles]

57:26.410 --> 57:27.409
Ahem.

57:30.347 --> 57:32.781
Ohh,
it's so close.

57:32.817 --> 57:35.451
All the details are accurate.
I had Colin check.

57:35.486 --> 57:36.552
Yes, I know.

57:36.587 --> 57:37.953
I can see that.
It's just...

57:37.988 --> 57:40.222
When we start to go deep,

57:40.257 --> 57:42.825
about how Luke and Abby feel,

57:42.860 --> 57:46.462
we just fall short
of what could be amazing.

57:46.497 --> 57:48.964
[Sighs] I mean, these two,
they can't be together,

57:48.999 --> 57:50.065
so it should feel
like torture.

57:51.669 --> 57:53.001
They should be together.

57:53.037 --> 57:54.236
What?

57:54.271 --> 57:55.270
What?

57:55.306 --> 57:56.271
Are you okay?

57:56.307 --> 57:57.739
You're not...

57:57.775 --> 57:59.975
You know,
distracted by anything?

58:00.010 --> 58:01.944
Or anyone?

58:01.979 --> 58:03.078
What? No!

58:03.113 --> 58:05.280
Yes. No. I'm good.

58:05.316 --> 58:07.349
I'm great!

58:07.384 --> 58:08.617
Pain, love, torture.
I got it.

58:08.652 --> 58:09.985
It's already written.
You're welcome.

58:13.958 --> 58:15.557
Good.

58:16.660 --> 58:17.993
Thanks.

58:18.028 --> 58:19.428
Colin?

58:19.463 --> 58:20.462
[Laughs]

58:20.498 --> 58:21.797
Alexis!

58:21.832 --> 58:23.098
Hi!

58:23.133 --> 58:24.600
What brings you here?

58:24.635 --> 58:26.435
My sister's office
is next door.

58:26.470 --> 58:29.438
I thought I'd be spontaneous
and visit her.

58:29.473 --> 58:31.273
And friend.

58:31.308 --> 58:32.808
[Chuckles]

58:34.044 --> 58:35.511
So when they say
"permanent marker,"

58:35.546 --> 58:37.045
they aren't kidding!

58:37.081 --> 58:38.614
We had to get Doug
a whole new briefcase.

58:38.649 --> 58:40.015
Oh, man.

58:40.050 --> 58:41.650
Cute kids, though.

58:41.685 --> 58:43.185
You know, your name
came up in conversation

58:43.220 --> 58:44.319
the other day.

58:44.355 --> 58:45.888
Do I want to know?

58:45.923 --> 58:47.055
Oh, it's all good.
I was just recounting

58:47.091 --> 58:49.024
your love of
the royal family.

58:49.059 --> 58:50.893
[Laughing]
That's right.

58:50.928 --> 58:52.361
I made you watch
the wedding.

58:52.396 --> 58:53.428
Yes, you did.

58:53.464 --> 58:55.464
I'm surprised you didn't
break up with me right away.

58:55.499 --> 58:56.965
Oh, I wanted to.

58:57.001 --> 58:58.534
I believe you used

58:58.569 --> 59:00.836
the "I'm being sent
to Istanbul" excuse.

59:00.871 --> 59:02.704
I was sent to Istanbul.

59:02.740 --> 59:04.306
Well, you were
always going off

59:04.341 --> 59:05.340
somewhere else.

59:05.376 --> 59:06.575
-Mm.
-So!

59:06.610 --> 59:09.511
Where's your next
big adventure?

59:09.547 --> 59:10.879
New Zealand.

59:10.915 --> 59:12.814
Are you going alone?

59:12.850 --> 59:13.849
Yeah.

59:13.884 --> 59:14.750
Why?

59:14.785 --> 59:15.751
It's just...

59:15.786 --> 59:17.419
You're such
a catch, Colin.

59:17.454 --> 59:19.521
Ah, I don't know
about that.

59:19.557 --> 59:21.490
Is there someone?

59:23.394 --> 59:26.428
I'm not sure.

59:26.463 --> 59:27.930
Was this the "friend"

59:27.965 --> 59:30.198
that you were being
spontaneous for?

59:31.302 --> 59:32.734
Yeah.

59:32.770 --> 59:35.003
Huh. Interesting.

59:35.039 --> 59:36.104
Why?

59:36.140 --> 59:37.839
You were never
spontaneous.

59:37.875 --> 59:38.740
I was spontaneous!

59:38.776 --> 59:41.243
You planned everything
to the last detail,

59:41.278 --> 59:43.011
and you never deviated,

59:43.047 --> 59:44.446
when we dated.

59:44.481 --> 59:46.114
It's what made you
a great seal,

59:46.150 --> 59:48.283
but a terrible boyfriend.

59:48.319 --> 59:49.918
I never thought
about that.

59:49.954 --> 59:51.453
It doesn't matter.

59:51.488 --> 59:53.689
I'm gone
in a few weeks,

59:53.724 --> 59:55.691
and I've never been
a stay-in-one-place kinda guy.

59:55.726 --> 59:57.125
First of all,

59:57.161 --> 59:58.894
love always matters.

59:58.929 --> 01:00:00.195
And secondly,

01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:02.230
settling down
doesn't have to be a place.

01:00:02.266 --> 01:00:03.765
It can be a person.

01:00:03.801 --> 01:00:06.468
Doug and I and the kids,
i mean, we travel all the time,

01:00:06.503 --> 01:00:09.071
and I know that,
wherever they are,

01:00:09.106 --> 01:00:10.305
that's my home.

01:00:10.341 --> 01:00:13.241

you must complete this course

Seriously, I can't.

01:01:05.396 --> 01:01:06.595
If you had let me
keep that attitude,

01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:09.031
I wouldn't be going on a date
with Annalise this Saturday!

01:01:09.066 --> 01:01:10.799
What? She said yes?
That's awesome!

01:01:10.834 --> 01:01:12.034
-I know!
-Focus, payden.

01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:14.503
It's too high.

01:01:14.538 --> 01:01:16.571
Go back a couple yards.
Come on.

Oh...

01:01:40.264 --> 01:01:42.531
Put your left foot down.
Now the other foot down.

01:01:42.566 --> 01:01:43.932
Look down here.

01:01:45.502 --> 01:01:46.668

now fall in my arms. Ready?

-Okay!

Without a doubt,

01:02:19.436 --> 01:02:24.706
the worst recorded time
in seal obstacle history.

01:02:24.742 --> 01:02:27.042
But you did it as a team.

01:02:27.077 --> 01:02:29.077

01:02:58.942 --> 01:03:00.776
Oh, hey!

01:03:00.811 --> 01:03:02.711
Congrats on finally
getting over the high wall.

01:03:02.746 --> 01:03:04.112
Thanks.

01:03:04.148 --> 01:03:05.814
I read the new pages

01:03:05.849 --> 01:03:07.449
with the Luke and Abby reunion,
and i--

01:03:07.484 --> 01:03:09.217
were the seal parts accurate?

01:03:10.521 --> 01:03:11.653
They were.

01:03:11.688 --> 01:03:13.421
Great.

01:03:13.457 --> 01:03:15.791
Jo! Hang on.

01:03:15.826 --> 01:03:17.459
Is everything okay?

01:03:17.494 --> 01:03:18.627
Yeah. Fine.
I'm just really busy.

01:03:18.662 --> 01:03:20.929
Actually, I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

01:03:20.964 --> 01:03:22.264
This will be my last bootcamp.

01:03:22.299 --> 01:03:23.398
There are no more seal parts
to my book,

01:03:23.433 --> 01:03:25.867
and I really need to buckle down
and meet my deadline.

01:03:27.938 --> 01:03:29.171
Just like that?

01:03:29.206 --> 01:03:32.107
We both knew
this was temporary.

Right. Well...
[Forced chuckle]

01:03:35.846 --> 01:03:37.846
Let's at least
go out to celebrate.

01:03:37.881 --> 01:03:38.914
You've put in
a lot of hard work.

01:03:38.949 --> 01:03:41.116
I've got something planned
already with the team.

01:03:41.151 --> 01:03:41.983
I don't want to bother you.

01:03:42.019 --> 01:03:43.785
You've already gone
above and beyond.

01:03:43.821 --> 01:03:46.588
And this way,
you have time to get ready

01:03:46.623 --> 01:03:48.256
for your next great adventure.

01:03:48.292 --> 01:03:50.292
I'm sure I'll see you,
maybe once before you go.

01:03:50.327 --> 01:03:52.194
Sure.

01:03:52.229 --> 01:03:54.296
The boys are ready.

01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:56.598
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

01:03:57.701 --> 01:04:00.168
[♪♪♪]

01:04:08.078 --> 01:04:09.344
Oh...

01:04:09.379 --> 01:04:10.912
Don't you look cheery.

01:04:12.249 --> 01:04:14.182
Hey.

01:04:15.552 --> 01:04:18.119
Having second thoughts
about leaving?

01:04:18.155 --> 01:04:20.655
Well, the new bootcamp
has to be opened,

01:04:20.691 --> 01:04:23.458
and the investors won't be happy
if I skipped it.

01:04:23.493 --> 01:04:26.194
Okay. That doesn't
answer my question,

01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:28.730
which, you know,
answers my question.

01:04:28.765 --> 01:04:30.632
And also
raises another...

01:04:30.667 --> 01:04:33.335
What does this have to do
with Jo?

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:34.636
What makes you think--

01:04:34.671 --> 01:04:36.571
don't.

01:04:36.607 --> 01:04:39.841
You've been my responsibility
since you were 10.

01:04:39.877 --> 01:04:42.043
I know every expression
in your repertoire.

01:04:42.079 --> 01:04:43.478
You cannot surprise me.

01:04:43.513 --> 01:04:45.280
I think
I'm in love with her.

01:04:46.683 --> 01:04:48.850
Until now.

01:04:48.886 --> 01:04:51.019
Wow.

01:04:51.054 --> 01:04:53.822
I've never heard you
say those words before.

01:04:53.857 --> 01:04:55.290
Are you sure?

01:04:57.094 --> 01:04:58.660
No.

01:04:58.695 --> 01:05:01.162
No.

01:05:01.198 --> 01:05:03.832
But...

01:05:03.867 --> 01:05:06.201
I can't stop
thinking about her.

01:05:06.236 --> 01:05:07.669
It's like there's

01:05:07.704 --> 01:05:10.105
this Jo payden loop
playing in my head.

01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:11.940
Part of me
wants to turn it off,

01:05:11.975 --> 01:05:13.742
but another part of me
wants to...

01:05:13.777 --> 01:05:16.711
Let it play on forever.

01:05:16.747 --> 01:05:19.781
The craziest part is,
we haven't even...

01:05:19.816 --> 01:05:21.516
Haven't even kissed.

01:05:21.551 --> 01:05:22.684
Really?

01:05:22.719 --> 01:05:23.752
Yeah.

01:05:23.787 --> 01:05:25.720
Nothing makes sense,

01:05:25.756 --> 01:05:27.722
but, from the first moment,

01:05:27.758 --> 01:05:30.191
my heart beat faster.

01:05:30.227 --> 01:05:32.560
When she's not there,
i look for her,

01:05:32.596 --> 01:05:34.195
and when she is there,

01:05:34.231 --> 01:05:37.032
I have to stop myself
from staring.

01:05:37.067 --> 01:05:39.567
You sound
like a romance novel.

01:05:39.603 --> 01:05:41.536
I know.

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:45.440
Well, have you told her
any of this?

01:05:46.843 --> 01:05:48.209
I don't know where to begin.

01:05:48.245 --> 01:05:50.578
You get in your car,

01:05:50.614 --> 01:05:51.780
you drive to her place,

01:05:51.815 --> 01:05:52.914
you knock on the door.

01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:54.382
When she answers,
you say,

01:05:54.418 --> 01:05:55.450
"Jo...

01:05:55.485 --> 01:05:56.918
"I have feelings for you,

01:05:56.954 --> 01:05:58.586
"but I'm leaving.

01:05:58.622 --> 01:06:01.723
So what exactly are
your thoughts on this subject?"

01:06:01.758 --> 01:06:03.458
That sounds academic, d.

01:06:03.493 --> 01:06:04.893
Well, then, you use
your own words,

01:06:04.928 --> 01:06:06.394
but you do it.

01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:09.898
I'm older than mom and dad were
when they passed.

01:06:09.933 --> 01:06:12.600
You're almost there.

01:06:12.636 --> 01:06:15.303
Life is
so short, Colin.

01:06:15.339 --> 01:06:16.905
If you're in love with her,

01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:19.307
or even if you think
you might be,

01:06:19.343 --> 01:06:21.743
you have to tell her.

01:06:21.778 --> 01:06:24.112
What about your rewrite?

01:06:25.615 --> 01:06:27.949
You're more important
than the rewrite.

01:06:29.353 --> 01:06:30.285
But if you
could maybe not

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.854
get her so upset
that she can't finish it ...

01:06:32.889 --> 01:06:34.122
[Chuckles]

01:06:36.226 --> 01:06:37.492
Mwah.

01:06:37.527 --> 01:06:39.094
Get going.

01:06:39.129 --> 01:06:40.228
Yeah.

01:06:44.234 --> 01:06:46.634
"He appeared
as if out of a dream,

01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:49.604
raising more questions
than he answered..."

01:06:52.843 --> 01:06:55.176

01:07:03.987 --> 01:07:04.919
Hi.

01:07:04.955 --> 01:07:07.622
Colin, hey.
Uh... what are you doing here?

01:07:07.657 --> 01:07:09.657
You mind if I come in?

01:07:09.693 --> 01:07:11.292
S-- uh, sure.

01:07:11.328 --> 01:07:13.261
Thanks.

01:07:16.733 --> 01:07:18.500
Uh, this feels like

01:07:18.535 --> 01:07:20.735
the first time I went through

01:07:20.771 --> 01:07:22.871
"drown-proof" training
in buds.

01:07:22.906 --> 01:07:23.938
Oh, that's where

01:07:23.974 --> 01:07:25.573
they tie your arms
and your legs together, right?

01:07:25.609 --> 01:07:26.574
Yeah.
-And you...

01:07:26.610 --> 01:07:28.143
And you jump
in the pool.

01:07:28.178 --> 01:07:31.012
Yeah, glad we didn't
get to that exercise.

01:07:31.048 --> 01:07:32.514
[Laughs]

01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:35.550
Look, Jo, um...

01:07:35.585 --> 01:07:37.585
The thing is...

01:07:37.621 --> 01:07:39.854
Uh...

01:07:39.890 --> 01:07:41.022
Are you okay?

01:07:41.058 --> 01:07:42.524
Y-yeah, yeah.

01:07:42.559 --> 01:07:45.326
I'm sorry.
It's just, uh,

01:07:45.362 --> 01:07:48.063
I wanted to tell you something
before I leave.

01:07:49.299 --> 01:07:50.665
Um, Colin, let me--
let me start.

01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:51.800
I just want to say

01:07:51.835 --> 01:07:55.537
that I am so glad that Diana
paired us up together.

01:07:55.572 --> 01:07:57.172
So am I.

01:07:57.207 --> 01:07:59.374
And if you had
told me on day one,

01:07:59.409 --> 01:08:01.209
when I spilled coffee
all over you,

01:08:01.244 --> 01:08:03.411
after you "saved me"
from a skateboarder

01:08:03.447 --> 01:08:04.879
that may or may not
have existed--

01:08:04.915 --> 01:08:06.581
he existed.

01:08:06.616 --> 01:08:09.751
...that you and I would have
ended up, uh, ahem, friends...

01:08:09.786 --> 01:08:12.654
I wouldn't have
believed it.

01:08:13.924 --> 01:08:15.290
"Friends."

01:08:15.325 --> 01:08:17.792
And I'm so grateful
to you, you know.

01:08:17.828 --> 01:08:19.694
And not just for your help
with the book,

01:08:19.729 --> 01:08:21.863
but for bootcamp.

01:08:21.898 --> 01:08:24.032
That is an experience
i will never forget.

01:08:24.067 --> 01:08:27.234
I mean,
i was part of a team. Me!

01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:30.939
And I accomplished more than
i ever even thought possible,

01:08:30.974 --> 01:08:33.575
so... thank you.

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:35.376
I'm glad it helped.

01:08:35.412 --> 01:08:36.578
It did.

01:08:36.613 --> 01:08:37.779
Immensely.

01:08:39.816 --> 01:08:41.549

get back to whatever it was
you were doing.

get together

they've been through.

pain, torture, love.

Oh. A surprise.

It was the best photo.

01:10:44.241 --> 01:10:46.374
Ohh...

01:10:46.409 --> 01:10:49.711
But my book covers
usually just feature the man.

01:10:49.746 --> 01:10:52.080
Yeah, well, I felt we'd make
a little exception.

01:10:53.283 --> 01:10:54.849
Has Colin seen it?

01:10:54.884 --> 01:10:56.684
No, he's not.

01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:59.020
He's been very busy,
getting ready for New Zealand.

01:10:59.055 --> 01:11:02.190
Oh, yeah.
He must be really excited.

01:11:02.225 --> 01:11:04.559
No, it's work,
it's not a vacation.

01:11:04.594 --> 01:11:05.593
And if he didn't have to go,

01:11:05.629 --> 01:11:07.695
I know for a fact
that he would stay right here.

01:11:07.731 --> 01:11:09.297
Why do you say that?
Is something wrong?

01:11:09.332 --> 01:11:10.431
Not at all!

01:11:10.467 --> 01:11:12.967
But, you know, you could
phone him yourself and find out.

01:11:13.003 --> 01:11:15.069
Well, I'm a smidge busy

01:11:15.105 --> 01:11:16.738

01:11:16.773 --> 01:11:18.706

part about this book is,

01:11:18.742 --> 01:11:20.975
it's real.

01:11:21.011 --> 01:11:23.578
I think it's probably the best
thing you've ever written.

01:11:23.613 --> 01:11:24.612
Really?

01:11:24.648 --> 01:11:27.282

When he came by,

01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:17.865
you should've asked him

01:12:17.901 --> 01:12:19.267
who that woman was
or something.

01:12:19.302 --> 01:12:20.935

We are not dating.

01:12:21.838 --> 01:12:23.137
I didn't have the right
to be mad at him

01:12:23.173 --> 01:12:24.772
for seeing someone else.

01:12:24.808 --> 01:12:27.275

it doesn't hurt.

You liked him more than
I've seen you like anyone.

01:12:31.214 --> 01:12:32.780
Even Todd.

01:12:33.983 --> 01:12:36.050
I think
i more than liked him.

01:12:36.086 --> 01:12:38.820
Oh, honey.

01:12:38.855 --> 01:12:41.389
Pj's right.

01:12:41.424 --> 01:12:43.725
Love is scary.

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:45.626
I don't know,
i just feel like

01:12:45.662 --> 01:12:47.195
I waited so long
to find somebody

01:12:47.230 --> 01:12:49.297
who makes me feel...

01:12:52.035 --> 01:12:53.868
[Tearfully]:
Who makes me feel.

01:12:55.939 --> 01:12:57.171
You should
say that to him.

01:12:57.207 --> 01:12:58.139
No, I can't.

01:12:58.174 --> 01:12:59.240
Why not?

01:12:59.275 --> 01:13:00.375
Because what if
he laughs at me,

01:13:00.410 --> 01:13:02.577
or, worse,
what if he pities me?

01:13:02.612 --> 01:13:03.845
I mean...

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:06.180
Every person who has
ever fallen in love

01:13:06.216 --> 01:13:08.883
has felt that exact
same way at least once,

01:13:08.918 --> 01:13:11.986
including
your perfect parents.

01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:16.591
I've had mine
stomped on,

01:13:16.626 --> 01:13:18.693
crushed...

01:13:18.728 --> 01:13:20.528
But at least I tried.

01:13:22.031 --> 01:13:23.364
I mean, I tried.

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:25.533
A little.

01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:30.738
Not enough.

01:13:30.774 --> 01:13:32.907
[Choking up]:
I'm such a coward.

01:13:34.210 --> 01:13:37.245
Oh, sweetie. No.

01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:39.347
[♪♪♪]

01:13:48.224 --> 01:13:50.191
[♪♪♪]

01:14:01.738 --> 01:14:03.070
There you go.

01:14:03.106 --> 01:14:04.472
Thanks.

01:14:04.507 --> 01:14:06.541
Hi.

01:14:06.576 --> 01:14:08.209
Hey!

01:14:08.244 --> 01:14:09.243
Hi.

01:14:09.279 --> 01:14:10.878
You're here.

01:14:10.914 --> 01:14:13.481
I wouldn't miss the book launch
of my favorite author.

01:14:13.516 --> 01:14:15.216
Ohh.

01:14:15.251 --> 01:14:17.552
-Look.
-What's going on here?

01:14:17.587 --> 01:14:18.953
Did you see
the acknowledgements?

01:14:18.988 --> 01:14:20.721
Yeah, d showed me.

01:14:20.757 --> 01:14:21.989
That's very nice.
Thank you.

01:14:22.025 --> 01:14:23.591
So when do you leave?

01:14:23.626 --> 01:14:24.926
I fly out in a few hours.

01:14:24.961 --> 01:14:28.129
But I changed my ticket
so I could be here,

01:14:28.164 --> 01:14:29.697
and give you this.

01:14:32.168 --> 01:14:34.101
Do you want me to sign it?

01:14:34.137 --> 01:14:36.504
No.

01:14:36.539 --> 01:14:38.673
I actually wrote something
for you inside,

01:14:38.708 --> 01:14:41.409
but don't read it
now, please.

01:14:41.444 --> 01:14:44.979
It's... what I couldn't say
to you the other night.

01:14:48.985 --> 01:14:51.919
So you did come over,
planning to say something?

01:14:51.955 --> 01:14:53.754
But I choked.

01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:55.756
Like a new recruit.

01:14:58.528 --> 01:14:59.961
But it's in here.

01:15:05.034 --> 01:15:07.568
[♪♪♪]

01:15:10.173 --> 01:15:12.106
[Diana clears her throat]

01:15:14.878 --> 01:15:17.278
Anyway, um...
Congratulations.

01:15:17.313 --> 01:15:18.980
This is great.

01:15:19.015 --> 01:15:21.148
Thank you. Have a--
have a great trip.

01:15:21.184 --> 01:15:22.850
[Colin]: Thank you.

01:15:22.886 --> 01:15:25.219
Goodbye, Jo.

01:15:25.255 --> 01:15:26.787
Bye.

01:15:28.658 --> 01:15:30.224
See you, sis.

01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:31.759
Bye, Molly.

01:15:32.896 --> 01:15:34.829
Hi! How are you?

01:15:34.864 --> 01:15:36.998
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:15:37.033 --> 01:15:38.332
[Colin]: Good to see you.

01:15:39.502 --> 01:15:41.335
You too.

01:15:41.371 --> 01:15:43.871
-Enjoy.
-Okay.

01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:49.410
I'm sorry. Who do i
make it out to, again?

01:15:49.445 --> 01:15:50.378
Yeah.

01:15:53.383 --> 01:15:55.917
[Jo]: Thank you.

01:15:55.952 --> 01:15:57.518
Hi! I'm Alexis.

01:15:57.554 --> 01:16:00.121
I'm an old friend of Colin's
and I'm a huge fan.

01:16:00.156 --> 01:16:02.390
Alexis?

01:16:02.425 --> 01:16:04.725
Yeah, when we ran
into each other a few weeks ago,

01:16:04.761 --> 01:16:06.561
Colin said that you two
were working together

01:16:06.596 --> 01:16:08.129
and I nearly died!

01:16:08.164 --> 01:16:10.064
I loved <i> dangerous in blue.</i>

01:16:10.099 --> 01:16:11.699
Oh, thank you
so much.

01:16:11.734 --> 01:16:13.868
That's so nice
of you to say.

01:16:13.903 --> 01:16:17.471
So, you and Colin are...
Are dating now?

01:16:17.507 --> 01:16:19.140
What? Oh...

01:16:19.175 --> 01:16:22.977
No, no.
I've been married for years.

01:16:23.012 --> 01:16:25.746
Oh, Colin and I did date
for, like, a microsecond,

01:16:25.782 --> 01:16:28.215
back when I made him
watch the royal wedding.

01:16:28.251 --> 01:16:29.750
Kate middleton.

01:16:29.786 --> 01:16:31.719
Oh, I love her!

01:16:31.754 --> 01:16:34.455
I thought you two were dating.
Maybe?

01:16:34.490 --> 01:16:36.390
Why?

01:16:36.426 --> 01:16:38.392
Well, it was the way
he was talking about you,

01:16:38.428 --> 01:16:39.627
like his tone.

01:16:39.662 --> 01:16:42.330
Even when it was just about
how he helped consult on this.

01:16:42.365 --> 01:16:43.998
He clearly thinks
the world of you.

01:16:44.033 --> 01:16:47.335
It was really sweet
and romantic, you know?

01:16:47.370 --> 01:16:48.369
What am I talking about?
Of course, you know!

01:16:48.404 --> 01:16:51.005
This is the stuff
you write about all the time!

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:53.608
Yeah.

01:16:53.643 --> 01:16:55.743
Oh. There you go.

01:16:55.778 --> 01:16:57.778
Thank you so much.
You're so awesome.

01:17:01.050 --> 01:17:03.084
I'm sorry,
just give me one...

01:17:03.119 --> 01:17:05.086
One second.

01:17:07.557 --> 01:17:10.458
I think I need
a minute.

01:17:10.493 --> 01:17:12.093
Are you okay?

01:17:12.128 --> 01:17:13.894
I don't know.

01:17:14.998 --> 01:17:17.698
[♪♪♪]

01:17:27.710 --> 01:17:29.076
[Colin]: "Jo.

01:17:29.112 --> 01:17:31.379
"I'm no writer,
so please be kind.

01:17:31.414 --> 01:17:33.381
"I've been on missions
around the world,

01:17:33.416 --> 01:17:35.416
"but I've never been
as scared as I was

01:17:35.451 --> 01:17:38.753
"when I tried to tell you
how special you are to me,

01:17:38.788 --> 01:17:41.522
"and how I wish
i was staying here with you,

01:17:41.557 --> 01:17:43.658
"so we could have a chance...

01:17:43.693 --> 01:17:46.494
"Instead of leaving.

01:17:46.529 --> 01:17:49.664
"And I realize that 'home'
isn't a location.

01:17:49.699 --> 01:17:51.732
"It's a person.

01:17:51.768 --> 01:17:53.834
"And, for me,
you're that person.

01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:56.504
Love, Colin."

01:18:01.544 --> 01:18:03.577
You're not gonna
fight for him?

01:18:03.613 --> 01:18:04.945
Fight--?

01:18:04.981 --> 01:18:07.782
What do you...
What do you mean, fight for him?

01:18:07.817 --> 01:18:09.684
What kind of
romance writer

01:18:09.719 --> 01:18:11.185
are you, payden?

01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:12.453
This is exactly

01:18:12.488 --> 01:18:14.689
when the heroine goes after
her true love.

01:18:14.724 --> 01:18:17.024
It's in almost every book.

01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:18.726
What?

01:18:18.761 --> 01:18:19.994
I love romance.

01:18:21.164 --> 01:18:22.296
She's right.

01:18:22.331 --> 01:18:23.531
I mean, you wouldn't
let me get away

01:18:23.566 --> 01:18:25.366
with that
about Annalise.

01:18:25.401 --> 01:18:28.636
Well-- [Sighs] Okay, no.
But it's different, because--

01:18:28.671 --> 01:18:30.471
-okay, here's--
-do the Yoda breathing.

01:18:30.506 --> 01:18:32.440
Thank you, tiny.

01:18:32.475 --> 01:18:34.909
You said
you wished you'd tried.

01:18:34.944 --> 01:18:37.912
Now you have a small window
for a second chance.

01:18:37.947 --> 01:18:39.080
Try.

01:18:39.115 --> 01:18:40.548
[Pj]:
It's totally worth it.

01:18:40.583 --> 01:18:41.582
You can do it, payden!

01:18:41.617 --> 01:18:44.085
Climb the wall.

01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:45.252
They have a point.

01:18:46.422 --> 01:18:49.323
I have been trying to stay
neutral through all of this,

01:18:49.358 --> 01:18:51.392
because I am your boss
and I am Colin's sister,

01:18:51.427 --> 01:18:52.426
but the book is done now,

01:18:52.462 --> 01:18:54.995
and I just watched my brother
walk out of here,

01:18:55.031 --> 01:18:57.832
looking forlorn
when he should be happy,

01:18:57.867 --> 01:19:00.067
so I'm gonna be blunt.

01:19:00.103 --> 01:19:02.303
Do you want to be with Colin
or not?

01:19:03.506 --> 01:19:05.272
Yeah, I do.

01:19:05.308 --> 01:19:07.141
Then what are you
still doing here?

01:19:07.176 --> 01:19:08.676
[Laughs]

01:19:08.711 --> 01:19:10.678
I don't know.

01:19:10.713 --> 01:19:12.646
Blue diamond air.

01:19:12.682 --> 01:19:15.149
Flight 725, departs at 9:30.

01:19:15.184 --> 01:19:17.485
So you'd be okay
with me just leaving here?

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:19.453
There's a big part of me
that is not happy

01:19:19.489 --> 01:19:21.856
you two did not
sort this out sooner

01:19:21.891 --> 01:19:24.792
so that I'm not stuck
in this situation,

01:19:24.827 --> 01:19:26.794
but there's bigger part

01:19:26.829 --> 01:19:29.497
that wants you to just to go
and get him already.

01:19:29.532 --> 01:19:31.265
And you're good with me
dating your brother?

01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:33.467
I am now that the book's
published, yes.

01:19:33.503 --> 01:19:35.169
And I also have a feeling

01:19:35.204 --> 01:19:37.471
the next one
is gonna be even better.

01:19:37.507 --> 01:19:39.039
Thanks, Diana.

01:19:39.075 --> 01:19:42.343
Go make Colin happy,
and I will sort out this mess.

01:19:43.813 --> 01:19:47.882
One-way ticket
to Auckland on flight 725...

01:19:47.917 --> 01:19:49.316
Is booked.

01:19:49.352 --> 01:19:50.351
Oh, my gosh.

01:19:50.386 --> 01:19:53.120
I have literally written
this scene so many times.

01:19:53.156 --> 01:19:56.123
I never thought that I would be
the one running to the airport!

01:19:56.159 --> 01:19:57.491
How does it feel?

01:19:57.527 --> 01:19:58.959
I don't have
anything I need.

01:19:58.995 --> 01:20:00.127
I don't have
a change of clothes.

01:20:00.163 --> 01:20:01.128
I don't have
a toothbrush.

01:20:01.164 --> 01:20:02.730
-I don't have the right shoes.
-What's this?

01:20:02.765 --> 01:20:03.798
It's my purse.

01:20:03.833 --> 01:20:04.799
And this?

01:20:04.834 --> 01:20:05.733
My wallet.

01:20:05.768 --> 01:20:06.867
Oh...

01:20:06.903 --> 01:20:07.835
Okay, it's my credit card.

01:20:07.870 --> 01:20:08.869
I understand
where you're going with this.

01:20:08.905 --> 01:20:09.937
Thank you.
Thank you.

01:20:09.972 --> 01:20:12.139
Jo, it's not the moon.
You're going on an adventure.

01:20:12.175 --> 01:20:13.841
A real one.

01:20:13.876 --> 01:20:15.042
I am, aren't I?

01:20:15.077 --> 01:20:16.076
Yep.

01:20:16.112 --> 01:20:17.378
Thank you, guys.

01:20:17.413 --> 01:20:20.581
Thank you for helping me
climb that wall.

01:20:20.616 --> 01:20:22.716
Love you guys.

01:20:22.752 --> 01:20:25.553
-Love you.
-I'm so proud of you.

01:20:25.588 --> 01:20:27.855
[Squeals]

01:20:30.726 --> 01:20:31.992
Bye.

01:20:32.028 --> 01:20:33.227
[Arms clap sides]

01:20:33.262 --> 01:20:34.228
[In unison]: Hooyah!

01:20:34.263 --> 01:20:36.831
[Giggles] That's still
really cute, you guys.

01:20:36.866 --> 01:20:38.499
Hooyah.

01:20:38.534 --> 01:20:40.167
Excuse me.

01:20:40.203 --> 01:20:41.769
Excuse me.
Excuse me, sorry.

01:20:41.804 --> 01:20:44.839
Oh, great.

01:20:48.377 --> 01:20:49.710
Hi.

01:20:49.745 --> 01:20:51.912
Hi. Wait. What?
What are you doing here?

01:20:51.948 --> 01:20:53.380
Don't you have
a flight to catch?

01:20:53.416 --> 01:20:55.282
Don't you have
a book-signing?

01:20:55.318 --> 01:20:59.787
Colin, I read what you wrote.
I couldn't stay.

01:20:59.822 --> 01:21:02.223
You're on my team.

01:21:02.258 --> 01:21:03.524
I shouldn't have let you go.

01:21:03.559 --> 01:21:05.459
I should've made sure
you were by my side.

01:21:05.494 --> 01:21:07.127
I'm so sorry.

01:21:07.163 --> 01:21:08.395
Don't apologize.

01:21:08.431 --> 01:21:09.763
When you bond with someone...

01:21:09.799 --> 01:21:11.365
You never leave them behind,

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:13.200
and I nearly did.

01:21:13.236 --> 01:21:15.302
What about your plans?

01:21:15.338 --> 01:21:17.805
Seals know
that you can plan all you want,

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:19.240
but once the boots
hit the ground,

01:21:19.275 --> 01:21:20.908
everything flies out the window.

01:21:20.943 --> 01:21:24.211
You gotta adapt
to the new situation.

01:21:24.247 --> 01:21:25.913
I was heading to the airport,

01:21:25.982 --> 01:21:26.947
and all I could think about

01:21:26.983 --> 01:21:29.717
was how much I wished
that you were with me.

01:21:29.752 --> 01:21:32.419
So I'm changing my plans.

01:21:34.523 --> 01:21:36.557
I couldn't leave without you.

01:21:41.197 --> 01:21:43.664
Well, my plans have kind of
changed a little bit, too.

01:21:43.699 --> 01:21:45.065
Um...

01:21:45.101 --> 01:21:47.401
I have a ticket

01:21:47.436 --> 01:21:49.069
to New Zealand.

01:21:50.873 --> 01:21:53.173
Really?

01:21:53.209 --> 01:21:54.508
Are you sure?

01:21:54.543 --> 01:21:56.944
Yeah.

01:21:56.979 --> 01:21:59.013
I'm so sure.

01:21:59.048 --> 01:22:01.916
I think it's about time that
i traveled internationally.

01:22:01.951 --> 01:22:04.084
Yes.

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:06.320
And fell in love.

01:22:09.458 --> 01:22:10.758
Yeah.

01:22:12.061 --> 01:22:14.795
[♪♪♪]

01:22:22.972 --> 01:22:24.104
Let's do this!

01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:25.806
Yeah! Okay.

01:22:27.376 --> 01:22:28.375
On three...

01:22:28.411 --> 01:22:29.510
Two...

01:22:29.545 --> 01:22:30.778
One...

01:22:30.813 --> 01:22:32.146
[Laughing]

01:22:32.181 --> 01:22:34.481
[Engine starting]

01:22:35.651 --> 01:22:37.918
[♪♪♪]

01:22:43.326 --> 01:22:48.362
[Jo]: <i> And so,</i>
<i> they walked away together,</i>

01:22:48.397 --> 01:22:49.964
<i> reunited as a team,</i>

01:22:49.999 --> 01:22:52.466
<i>with a shared sense of purpose,</i>

01:22:52.501 --> 01:22:58.672
<i> as they embarked on</i>
<i>their greatest adventure ever...</i>

01:22:58.708 --> 01:23:00.641
<i> True love.</i>

01:23:11.287 --> 01:23:15.189
