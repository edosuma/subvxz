WEBVTT

00:09.767 --> 00:11.333
- Yo! X Games!

00:11.433 --> 00:12.733
What the hell's up, man?

00:12.833 --> 00:14.000
This is Blake H.

00:14.100 --> 00:15.500
And right over here is...

00:15.600 --> 00:17.300
- Ders H.!

00:17.400 --> 00:19.700
And we're here to tell you
that you need to consider

00:19.800 --> 00:21.700
our new sport
for this summer's X Games.

00:21.800 --> 00:23.500
- Freaking don't
even consider it.

00:23.600 --> 00:24.900
Just take it,
you idiots.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.667
It's brilliant, all right?
- Duh.

00:26.767 --> 00:29.533
- Basically what we've done
is taken the sickest

00:29.633 --> 00:33.700
and gnar-gnarest, most epic
sports and mixed them together.

00:33.800 --> 00:37.000
I'm talking rollerblading,
I'm talking skateboard combined

00:37.100 --> 00:40.200
to make Roller-skating...2.

00:40.300 --> 00:43.167
- The New Class.
- Sick.

00:43.267 --> 00:44.167
What?

00:44.267 --> 00:46.033
DeMampsa, what up, bro?

00:46.133 --> 00:47.500
Are you ready to rip?

00:47.600 --> 00:49.033
- I'm ready to rip!

00:49.133 --> 00:50.567
Actually, I'm very nervous.

00:50.667 --> 00:52.233
I don't think I'm wearing
enough padding,

00:52.333 --> 00:54.967
but I will die for you guys!

00:55.067 --> 00:56.633
- Freaking rock on.
Ders, light it up.

00:56.733 --> 00:57.633
Let's do this.

00:57.733 --> 00:58.900
- Ready to go?
- Ow!

00:59.000 --> 01:00.900
- Little worried.
- Ow!

01:01.067 --> 01:02.200
- Whoo!

01:02.300 --> 01:03.533
- All right,
you got this, DeMamp!

01:03.633 --> 01:05.433
- [yelling]
- Ders, punch it!

01:05.533 --> 01:07.800
We're about to hit the jump!
- [screaming]

01:10.367 --> 01:12.200
- Whoa, dude!
- Whoo!

01:12.300 --> 01:14.100
- How did you land that, dude?
- [laughing]

01:14.200 --> 01:15.367
- Blake, tell me
you got the shot.

01:15.467 --> 01:16.533
- I got it--
- You got the shot?

01:16.633 --> 01:17.533
- Oh! Ah!
[cracking]

01:17.633 --> 01:18.967
Ow!

01:19.067 --> 01:21.367
- Great, Blake.
I hope you're happy.

01:21.467 --> 01:23.633
You lost the footie, and the
X Games are in like four days.

01:23.733 --> 01:25.933
Now we're gonna have to get a
new cameraman for the next run.

01:26.067 --> 01:27.667
- No. Next run?
There's not a next run.

01:27.767 --> 01:29.500
Blake's hurt, man.
- Yeah, didn't you hear him?

01:29.600 --> 01:31.667
I, like, fractured it
in, like, six places.

01:31.767 --> 01:33.367
I don't think my wrist
will ever walk again.

01:33.467 --> 01:34.833
- Fine.

01:34.933 --> 01:37.933
I'll freaking text Karl,
have him film it.

01:38.067 --> 01:40.300
He's not gonna be a bitch
about it and go to the hospital

01:40.400 --> 01:41.533
for no good reason.

01:41.633 --> 01:43.700
- Yeah, um, again,
serious injury.

01:43.800 --> 01:46.633
But it's okay 'cause I like
to ride in ambulances.

01:46.733 --> 01:47.867
[whispering]
I'm gonna steal drugs!

01:47.967 --> 01:49.533
- Get him out of my face!

01:49.633 --> 01:51.100
- I mean, I knew today was gonna
end with an ambulance ride.

01:51.200 --> 01:52.933
I just didn't think Blake
would be the one in it.

01:53.067 --> 01:54.367
- What's that supposed
to mean?

01:54.467 --> 01:56.367
- It means, like,
you're always getting hurt.

01:56.467 --> 01:58.300
[ambulance beeping]
- Yeah. Yeah, right, Ders.

01:58.400 --> 01:59.333
I get hurt all the time.

01:59.433 --> 02:01.067
[thudding]
- Dude! Hey!

02:01.100 --> 02:02.367
Whoa, guys!
Hey!

02:02.467 --> 02:05.400
[ambulance sirens wailing]

02:07.467 --> 02:09.067
[sighs]

02:09.167 --> 02:10.267
Hi, 911?

02:10.367 --> 02:11.800
Yeah, it's Anders again.

02:11.900 --> 02:14.267
Uh, look, can you tell
your boy to flip a B?

02:14.367 --> 02:15.467
We got another.

02:15.567 --> 02:18.467
[The Skinny Boys' "Jock Box"]

02:18.567 --> 02:19.567
*

02:19.667 --> 02:22.100
- * I'm fresh

02:22.200 --> 02:24.100
* You gotta, you gotta,
you gotta *

02:24.200 --> 02:26.133
* Gotta be fresh

02:27.767 --> 02:29.733
- God, man, I can't believe
I broke my wrist

02:29.833 --> 02:31.433
on my scratching hand.

02:31.533 --> 02:33.567
Ders, will you just give me
one little finger, please?

02:33.667 --> 02:34.967
- Dude, scratch
your own butt.

02:35.067 --> 02:36.500
I'm worried about Adam.

02:36.600 --> 02:38.400
He probably should've
gotten in the ambulance.

02:38.500 --> 02:40.100
He's got a concussion.
- He's fine, dude.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.900
- No, he's not, he's showing
all the symptoms--

02:42.067 --> 02:44.067
nausea, memory loss,
mood swings.

02:44.100 --> 02:47.067
- [vomits loudly]

02:50.067 --> 02:51.900
Ew!

02:52.067 --> 02:52.967
Who puked?

02:53.067 --> 02:54.467
[giggles]

02:54.567 --> 02:55.633
Answer me!

02:55.733 --> 02:57.167
- That was you.
You just did it.

02:57.267 --> 02:59.567
- All right.
Listen up, everybody.

02:59.667 --> 03:02.167
Because of the little stunt
these three morons pulled

03:02.267 --> 03:03.833
in the parking lot,

03:03.933 --> 03:07.067
corporate now wants us to take
an online safety course,

03:07.167 --> 03:09.133
which sounds super fun.

03:09.233 --> 03:11.367
So it'll take about
three hours, so after lunch,

03:11.467 --> 03:12.700
just get to your cubicles--

03:12.800 --> 03:14.067
- Who's the coolest?
- [choking]

03:14.167 --> 03:16.133
- Who's the coolest?
Who's the coolest?

03:16.233 --> 03:17.533
Can't hear you.
Going to sleep.

03:17.633 --> 03:19.133
Oh, good night.

03:19.233 --> 03:20.533
I'm her sister.

03:20.633 --> 03:23.067
I'm Juliette.
It's all good.

03:23.167 --> 03:25.400
Oh, God,
I think I'm still drunk.

03:25.500 --> 03:29.267
Me and B-Rad just did a 12-hour
shift at Spearmint Rhino.

03:29.367 --> 03:31.633
That pig is still there
just crushing hot wings.

03:31.733 --> 03:33.067
- Sick.
- B-Rad.

03:33.133 --> 03:34.233
- That's sick.
- I miss that guy.

03:34.333 --> 03:36.400
- Classic sleeper hold, huh?

03:36.500 --> 03:37.900
- Still funny.

03:38.067 --> 03:40.433
- I see that you've met
my sister, Juliette.

03:40.533 --> 03:42.467
She's going to be
filling in for Jillian

03:42.567 --> 03:44.567
while she's on
National Guard duty.

03:44.667 --> 03:46.867
- Cool. Freaking sick.
- Yeah.

03:46.967 --> 03:48.933
- What the hell was I saying?

03:49.067 --> 03:51.633
- You were doing some BS speech
about safety or something.

03:51.733 --> 03:54.267
Dude, I knew this job was gonna
be a complete dookie fountain.

03:54.367 --> 03:56.100
- Dookie fountain.
- [laughing]

03:56.200 --> 03:58.567
- All right, well, this is how
much fun we're gonna have.

03:58.667 --> 04:01.967
Because if everybody passes
their online safety course,

04:02.067 --> 04:04.700
I'm gonna take you
on a nature hike.

04:04.800 --> 04:06.367
- Go walking?
- That's lame.

04:06.467 --> 04:07.700
I have a better idea.

04:07.800 --> 04:09.200
I used to date
this chick in the Navy.

04:09.300 --> 04:10.533
She has a jump plane.

04:10.633 --> 04:11.867
We can go skydiving.

04:11.967 --> 04:13.533
- Are you serious?
- What?

04:13.633 --> 04:15.333
- Oh, we should go skydiving!
- Finally.

04:15.433 --> 04:17.067
- Let's go skydiving!

04:17.100 --> 04:19.933
Let's go skydiving.
- Guys. Come on, skydiving?

04:20.067 --> 04:21.833
That's--that's not cool.

04:21.933 --> 04:24.067
It's, like, so '90s.

04:24.133 --> 04:26.167
- What, are you kidding me?
The '90s were awesome.

04:26.267 --> 04:29.733
Like "Space Jam,"
"Doug," Lark Voorhies.

04:29.833 --> 04:31.333
- Yup.
"Real World: Seattle."

04:31.433 --> 04:32.733
When Stephen slapped Irene?

04:32.833 --> 04:34.333
That was off the hook.

04:34.433 --> 04:36.267
- It was.
- Uh, Blink 182.

04:36.367 --> 04:37.700
"What's My Age Again?"

04:37.800 --> 04:39.233
- Yeah.
- What is my age again?

04:39.333 --> 04:41.167
- Are you serious?
- How old am I?

04:41.267 --> 04:43.067
- [chanting] Skydiving...

04:43.100 --> 04:45.500
- Don't start chanting, please--
all: Skydiving!

04:45.600 --> 04:47.567
Skydiving!

04:47.667 --> 04:50.067
Skydiving!
- All right, okay, fine!

04:50.133 --> 04:53.067
If you wanna go freaking
skydiving, we'll go skydiving.

04:53.167 --> 04:55.900
[all cheering]

04:56.067 --> 04:58.733
- Yes! Yes!

04:58.833 --> 05:01.333
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Yes!

05:01.433 --> 05:02.667
- [laughing]
Yes, yes, yes.

05:02.767 --> 05:04.967
- Ew!
Who puked?

05:05.067 --> 05:06.600
[laughs]

05:06.700 --> 05:08.067
Yeah!

05:08.100 --> 05:10.067
This freaking safety test
is impossible.

05:10.167 --> 05:14.667
- Adam, ple--okay, well,
you are on farmersonly.com

05:14.767 --> 05:16.467
You're not even taking
the test right now.

05:16.567 --> 05:18.067
We just--
we need to concentrate.

05:18.100 --> 05:19.700
Do you not want to go
on the field trip, dude?

05:19.800 --> 05:21.633
Come on,
it's gonna be super fun.

05:21.733 --> 05:24.167
- Dude, you know what happens
on field trips.

05:24.267 --> 05:26.067
Bus ride hookups.

05:26.133 --> 05:27.900
- [laughs]
- This guy knows. Look.

05:28.067 --> 05:31.367
You get your Starter jacket out,
put your hand underneath,

05:31.467 --> 05:33.067
and you make the pussy queef.

05:33.167 --> 05:34.367
- You don't have to tell me.

05:34.467 --> 05:35.367
I've got history.

05:35.467 --> 05:36.900
Ninth grade, yeah.

05:37.067 --> 05:39.533
We took a field trip
to "Fiddler on the Roof,"

05:39.633 --> 05:42.900
and I "diddler" on the bus,
is what I did.

05:43.067 --> 05:44.367
- That's awesome.
- Hi.

05:44.467 --> 05:46.067
Uh, just taking a shot
in the dark here,

05:46.167 --> 05:49.067
but you drug addicts
definitely have drugs, right?

05:49.167 --> 05:50.533
- Uh...

05:50.633 --> 05:52.667
Uh...yes.
- Ahem.

05:52.767 --> 05:54.567
- I can't hear you.
- We got the hookup.

05:54.667 --> 05:56.300
Yeah, I can't--
it's just, your sister's

05:56.400 --> 05:58.067
just kind of watching us
like a hawk, so...

05:58.167 --> 06:00.267
- You're worried about Alice?
She's obsessed with me.

06:00.367 --> 06:01.700
She'll do anything
for my approval.

06:01.800 --> 06:03.267
Watch this.

06:03.367 --> 06:06.433
Hey, Alice, these guys
over here are doing drugs.

06:06.533 --> 06:07.767
- What?
- Cocaine, you name it.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.533
- No, no.
- Just kidding.

06:09.633 --> 06:11.333
I just didn't want to walk
all the way over there.

06:11.433 --> 06:13.933
So what are you getting me
for lunch, peachy?

06:14.067 --> 06:18.367
- Well, actually, I was going to
let this be a surprise,

06:18.467 --> 06:22.267
but we're gonna get some
El Pollo Loco tacos.

06:22.367 --> 06:25.100
- Uh, the thing about that is
I'd rather have balls

06:25.200 --> 06:27.200
in my mouth
than eat their tacos.

06:27.300 --> 06:28.267
- 'Cause she's a lesbian.

06:28.367 --> 06:29.800
- Sick.
- Thanks.

06:29.900 --> 06:31.633
Go to Tina's Tacos.
They're the best.

06:31.733 --> 06:34.667
Tell Tina you know me and she'll
give you that extra guac hookup.

06:34.767 --> 06:37.767
- Stop touching my breast.
- Vamonos. Mami's hungry.

06:37.867 --> 06:40.200
Mm!
- Smoking in Alice's office.

06:40.300 --> 06:41.533
- Okay, so you all passed.

06:41.633 --> 06:43.133
- Man, this sucks that
you're only gonna

06:43.233 --> 06:44.200
work here for two weeks.

06:44.300 --> 06:45.833
I really love you.
- Yeah.

06:45.933 --> 06:47.800
- No, two weeks--that's
my limit on any job, dude.

06:47.900 --> 06:49.667
- Mm.
- Whoa.

06:49.767 --> 06:52.767
You guys didn't tell me that a
famous actress worked here.

06:52.867 --> 06:54.067
- What, Didi?
- Yeah.

06:54.133 --> 06:56.433
- Oh, no, she's not
a famous actress.

06:56.533 --> 06:57.867
- No, it's Didi.
- Oh...

06:57.967 --> 07:00.433
- Yeah, she's a lizard.
- She used to be.

07:00.533 --> 07:03.067
Look at this.
Check this out.

07:03.133 --> 07:06.067
- Ooh. She is one bad
mama-jamma.

07:06.133 --> 07:09.767
- Didi's, like,
a lesbian icon.

07:09.867 --> 07:11.967
- What, bitch?
You gonna stand there and stare

07:12.067 --> 07:14.433
or you gonna sock it to my
pocket like a space rocket?

07:14.533 --> 07:17.800
- Oh, my stars.
You weren't kidding.

07:17.900 --> 07:19.600
- Nope.
- That's her, isn't it?

07:19.700 --> 07:21.933
- All your friends are dead.
Now you are too.

07:22.067 --> 07:25.767
[gunshots]

07:25.867 --> 07:27.833
- Dude, this puts Didi
in a whole new light.

07:27.933 --> 07:29.667
I think I just found my...

07:29.767 --> 07:31.300
bus ride hookup.

07:31.400 --> 07:34.300
- [coughs and grunts]

07:34.400 --> 07:36.600
- [laughs]
Oh, no, no, no, no, Ders.

07:36.700 --> 07:38.767
I'm the one who's gonna be
slipping Didi my digits.

07:38.867 --> 07:40.433
And I'm not talking about
my phone number.

07:40.533 --> 07:41.967
- I just called her, okay?

07:42.067 --> 07:43.767
Are we really about to have
this manversation?

07:43.867 --> 07:46.100
- Okay, yeah, actually we are.
I need some manswers, dude,

07:46.200 --> 07:47.900
and I'm sorry to talk about this
in front of you.

07:48.067 --> 07:49.567
It's just guy stuff.
- I mean, I'm fine with it.

07:49.667 --> 07:51.100
Dude, it's a field trip.

07:51.200 --> 07:52.400
I'm definitely finger-banging
a TelAmeri-vag.

07:52.500 --> 07:53.633
- [laughs]
- Yeah.

07:53.733 --> 07:55.233
- Yeah, but I called Didi.
- No--

07:55.333 --> 07:57.267
- Well, guys, I don't have time
for this buffoonery

07:57.367 --> 07:58.967
because I actually have
a meeting with Karl

07:59.067 --> 08:00.533
in the parking lot right now.

08:00.633 --> 08:03.300
- What? About what?
- I don't know, Anders!

08:03.400 --> 08:06.333
[clattering]

08:06.433 --> 08:07.533
- Okay.

08:07.633 --> 08:13.333
*

08:13.433 --> 08:15.367
[The Skinny Boys' "Jock Box"]

08:15.467 --> 08:18.267
- Hey, Didi, uh, could you help
me with something real quick?

08:18.367 --> 08:19.633
[wheels squeaking]
- Huh?

08:19.733 --> 08:21.467
- Yeah.
- What the--what's going on?

08:21.567 --> 08:23.667
- I just wanted to show you a
little something with my, uh,

08:23.767 --> 08:25.267
finger skateboard.

08:25.367 --> 08:28.167
Thought maybe you could watch me
shred some gnar tricks.

08:28.267 --> 08:31.267
Tell me how you like
my finger skills.

08:31.367 --> 08:34.767
Sit back, relax,
and enjoy the sho--oh!

08:34.867 --> 08:37.533
Oh, do you like
the way I ollie?

08:37.633 --> 08:38.967
Oh, that's weird,
I'm so good,

08:39.067 --> 08:40.667
and this isn't even
my good hand.

08:40.767 --> 08:42.500
I'm actually left-handed.
- [strums banjo]

08:42.600 --> 08:44.067
- If you get what I'm saying.

08:44.100 --> 08:47.067
- [strums banjo]
- What the hell's that?

08:47.133 --> 08:48.267
- Can you do this?

08:48.367 --> 08:49.867
What's up, Didi?
Check it.

08:49.967 --> 08:52.067
[plays upbeat bluegrass tune]
Ooh!

08:52.100 --> 08:53.067
Yeah!

08:53.167 --> 08:57.867
*

08:57.967 --> 08:59.533
They call them "licks"
for a reason.

08:59.633 --> 09:00.933
- [giggles]

09:01.067 --> 09:03.400
*

09:03.500 --> 09:04.633
- Yeah,
you're pretty cool.

09:04.733 --> 09:06.800
Honor.
- Okay. Yeah, no.

09:06.900 --> 09:08.900
And you can go lick off,
Steve Martin.

09:09.067 --> 09:11.100
Why don't you go put a arrow
through your head, you idiot?

09:11.200 --> 09:14.600
'Cause I was just about
to show her my final trick.

09:14.700 --> 09:16.833
- Oh, hey, finger skater boy.

09:16.933 --> 09:19.133
I said, see you later, boy.

09:19.233 --> 09:21.100
You're not good enough for her.

09:21.200 --> 09:23.067
- Okay, well, that's funny you
should say that,

09:23.167 --> 09:25.933
because it's gonna be pretty
hard for her to refuse my love

09:26.067 --> 09:28.600
when I can do this.
- Oh, oh!

09:28.700 --> 09:30.633
So it's time to battle?
- Watch this.

09:30.733 --> 09:32.733
- * She'll be coming around
the mountain when she comes *

09:32.833 --> 09:34.267
- Stop!
Obviously.

09:34.367 --> 09:36.633
- See you later, guys.
- What are you doing?

09:36.733 --> 09:38.333
- What?
It's an old-fashioned duel.

09:38.433 --> 09:40.467
Except instead of real guns,
we're using finger guns.

09:40.567 --> 09:42.267
- Oh, this isn't a duel, Ders,
okay?

09:42.367 --> 09:44.233
'Cause you don't stand a chance,
all right?

09:44.333 --> 09:46.767
'Cause I'm gonna be the one
at the back of the bus

09:46.867 --> 09:49.900
rocking Didi's world
with some erotic...

09:50.067 --> 09:50.933
pawing.

09:51.067 --> 09:52.400
[meowing]

09:52.500 --> 09:54.667
Am I getting right under
little kitty's chin?

09:54.767 --> 09:58.100
And then guess what.
While she's not looking...

09:58.200 --> 10:00.000
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, my God.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.333
Is that how you think you're
supposed to finger a girl?

10:02.433 --> 10:04.900
- Yeah. What, you think that's
how you finger a girl?

10:05.000 --> 10:06.900
Dude, you're a dummy--you don't
even have any cool moves.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.133
I got a cool move.

10:08.233 --> 10:10.067
You basically make
the shadow puppet dog,

10:10.167 --> 10:12.467
but then you shove it in, right?
And then it just bites the meat.

10:12.567 --> 10:14.067
- Ding-dong, ding-dong,
ding-dong, ding-dong.

10:14.167 --> 10:15.567
Let me in, ma'am,
I got a vacuum to sell ya.

10:15.667 --> 10:17.133
- Okay, this is what
I call the twister--

10:17.233 --> 10:18.467
- Okay, you guys!
Okay, stop.

10:18.567 --> 10:21.067
Come, follow me.
- What?

10:21.167 --> 10:22.433
- Working up a sweat.

10:22.533 --> 10:24.800
- Okay, that's secure.
Excellent.

10:24.900 --> 10:26.267
Oh, dude!

10:26.367 --> 10:29.333
Goons the [beep]-Eater
strikes again, man.

10:29.433 --> 10:31.167
[laughs]
That is funny.

10:31.267 --> 10:33.000
Oh, uh, talent on set.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.267
Okay, everybody, let's gather
round, let's do this.

10:35.367 --> 10:38.000
- Whoo!
Let's go, okay!

10:38.100 --> 10:39.267
Yeah!

10:39.367 --> 10:40.633
- You're lucky
we even showed up

10:40.733 --> 10:41.900
'cause we're a busy crew.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.367
We got back-to-back quinceañeras

10:43.467 --> 10:45.067
later on this afternoon,
so let's get to it.

10:45.167 --> 10:46.300
Time is money, all right?

10:46.400 --> 10:48.000
- [retches]

10:48.100 --> 10:49.667
Okay.
Yeah, let's do this.

10:49.767 --> 10:51.167
- Okay, let's roll camera.

10:51.267 --> 10:52.633
Roll sound.
- Rolling!

10:52.733 --> 10:55.333
- Good.
And...

10:55.433 --> 10:56.700
[mouthing]
Action.

11:00.733 --> 11:02.300
Adam--okay, man.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.733
Look, if you're nervous,
just use that emotion.

11:04.833 --> 11:06.233
Think about the script.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.767
Say your lines
with that emotion.

11:08.867 --> 11:09.933
It's gonna be great.

11:10.067 --> 11:11.633
- All right.

11:11.733 --> 11:13.100
Where's the script?

11:13.200 --> 11:14.567
- Okay, cut.

11:14.667 --> 11:16.067
Okay, we don't work
without a script,

11:16.167 --> 11:17.600
so if you'll excuse us,
we need to go watch

11:17.700 --> 11:20.567
two beautiful, young Mexican
females turn into

11:20.667 --> 11:23.600
two beautiful,
old Mexican women.

11:23.700 --> 11:26.067
So buh-buh-bye.

11:26.133 --> 11:28.067
- Oh, don't you turn
your backs on me!

11:28.133 --> 11:29.633
Don't you--

11:29.733 --> 11:31.100
I'll break everything
that you own!

11:31.200 --> 11:32.600
I will break you!

11:32.700 --> 11:35.467
I will ruin you
and your whole squadron!

11:35.567 --> 11:38.067
I'm gonna fight one
of these women right here.

11:38.167 --> 11:41.367
I'm gonna beat the shit
out of this girl right here.

11:41.467 --> 11:44.467
Yeah, the big one.
I'm coming for you--

11:44.567 --> 11:46.300
- Ooh!

11:46.400 --> 11:47.533
Homeless Mike,
are you okay?

11:47.633 --> 11:49.500
- Okay, lesson number one.

11:49.600 --> 11:51.467
Clitoris is on the top
of the kiwi.

11:51.567 --> 11:52.933
Copy that?
- Yeah.

11:53.067 --> 11:54.533
- Butthole is on the bottom.
- [giggling]

11:54.633 --> 11:56.133
- Just avoid that
unless she says not to.

11:56.233 --> 11:57.367
- Okay, okay.
- She's gonna say not to.

11:57.467 --> 11:58.667
So just calm down.

11:58.767 --> 12:00.067
I want you to just
go up and down,

12:00.100 --> 12:02.700
gently massage the clitoris.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.400
- Okay, and the clitoris
is in here?

12:04.500 --> 12:05.933
- Yes--oh! No!
- So get in there--

12:06.067 --> 12:07.333
- Yeah, get it, boy.
- Okay, stop. Stop.

12:07.433 --> 12:08.733
- Oh, look,
I'm making the Jell-O.

12:08.833 --> 12:10.200
- Here, let me just--
I'll show you.

12:10.300 --> 12:11.200
- At least there's liquid
coming out.

12:11.300 --> 12:12.500
I heard that's good.

12:12.600 --> 12:13.600
- When do we get to go
to the butthole?

12:13.700 --> 12:15.367
- Hi there.
- Hi.

12:15.467 --> 12:18.767
- So, uh, I actually found
something interesting.

12:18.867 --> 12:20.867
Um, I just went
on my computer

12:20.967 --> 12:22.833
and I checked
the safety course scores,

12:22.933 --> 12:27.400
and funny, it looks like you two
and Adam all scored a 69.

12:27.500 --> 12:28.600
- Oh, good for you guys.

12:28.700 --> 12:30.067
- Frickin' triple 69.
- Nice.

12:30.100 --> 12:31.533
- We've always wanted
to do that.

12:31.633 --> 12:33.067
- That's awesome!
- I'm not buying it.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.500
She put you up to this,
didn't she?

12:34.600 --> 12:36.167
- Look, we got those scores
on our own.

12:36.267 --> 12:38.067
I mean why--do you want a cup
for your hater-ade?

12:38.133 --> 12:39.867
'Cause that's what
you're drinking.

12:39.967 --> 12:41.967
Do you want a cup for it?
- That's a dirty cup though.

12:42.067 --> 12:44.167
- You should've seen
the other girl.

12:44.267 --> 12:45.567
- What?

12:45.667 --> 12:46.933
- I got in a fight
in the parking lot.

12:47.067 --> 12:48.067
I think I beat up a woman.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.233
- You know what?
That is it!

12:49.333 --> 12:50.467
Skydiving is cancelled.
- Ohh!

12:50.567 --> 12:52.267
- Okay? No!

12:52.367 --> 12:55.100
You are too much of a liability,
and I am not taking the risk.

12:55.200 --> 12:58.067
We are going with my plan,
and we're gonna go hiking.

12:58.100 --> 13:00.300
And it's gonna be fun.
Deer.

13:00.400 --> 13:01.733
- Deer?
Deers are pretty.

13:01.833 --> 13:03.367
- I'm supposed to diddle Didi!

13:03.467 --> 13:05.167
I can't do that if we're
going to Rancho Hills.

13:05.267 --> 13:07.067
That's like six minutes away.
How am I supposed

13:07.100 --> 13:08.667
to diddle Didi in six minutes?

13:08.767 --> 13:10.133
It's gonna take me
at least a half hour

13:10.233 --> 13:11.900
to find a clit
on the butthole.

13:12.067 --> 13:14.500
- I don't know why you guys
are talking to each other

13:14.600 --> 13:17.800
in that tone, and I don't know
why I'm in the kitchen.

13:17.900 --> 13:19.133
- Okay, everyone
just calm down.

13:19.233 --> 13:20.900
We're gonna go skydiving.

13:21.067 --> 13:23.733
I've been manipulating Alice
my entire life, all right?

13:23.833 --> 13:26.533
All we have to do is apologize,
do some grand gesture,

13:26.633 --> 13:27.667
and she's gonna fold.

13:27.767 --> 13:29.200
Okay?
- Yeah, no doubt.

13:29.300 --> 13:32.233
*

13:35.500 --> 13:37.400
- * Kick it

13:37.500 --> 13:38.700
- Here she comes,
here she comes.

13:38.800 --> 13:40.133
- Shh.
Everyone, be professional.

13:40.233 --> 13:41.833
- What the hell
are you guys doing in here?

13:41.933 --> 13:43.400
Get back to to work.

13:43.500 --> 13:45.567
- First of all, we want to say
that we are sorry

13:45.667 --> 13:47.567
and that we take safety
very seriously.

13:47.667 --> 13:49.200
And to show that--
have a seat--

13:49.300 --> 13:51.700
we put together
a little presentation.

13:51.800 --> 13:55.367
- Yes, welcome
to our presentation of...

13:55.467 --> 13:58.967
"Office Safety: It's Very
Important and We Get That."

13:59.067 --> 14:00.800
I'd love to run some stats
by you.

14:00.900 --> 14:04.067
Recent studies have shown
that the most dangerous things

14:04.167 --> 14:06.933
you can do are retreats
on earth.

14:07.067 --> 14:08.367
On the ground.

14:08.467 --> 14:10.867
Here's a great example
of what might happen

14:10.967 --> 14:12.767
on an outside work retreat.

14:12.867 --> 14:14.767
Juliette,
watch out for that cliff!

14:14.867 --> 14:17.800
- Cliff? What cliff?
[trailing off]

14:17.900 --> 14:21.967
- We shall celebrate our--
our bountiful harvest

14:22.067 --> 14:24.367
with our new native friends...

14:24.467 --> 14:28.200
by feasting and giving strength.

14:28.300 --> 14:29.967
Uh--thanks.

14:30.067 --> 14:32.800
And we shall call this day
"Thanksgiving."

14:32.900 --> 14:34.200
- Adam, wrong--
no, this is--

14:34.300 --> 14:36.167
wrong performance.
This is a safety presentation.

14:36.267 --> 14:40.167
- Your words make no sense
to me, noble Indian.

14:40.267 --> 14:42.833
But I shall thank you
and your people

14:42.933 --> 14:44.867
for the corn and the blankets.

14:44.967 --> 14:46.167
- What the hell
is wrong with him?

14:46.267 --> 14:47.967
- Corn.
So, okay.

14:48.067 --> 14:50.433
Say we're on the hike
and we're picking wild corn.

14:50.533 --> 14:52.100
Okay, and what's that?
Ah! Rattlesnake!

14:52.200 --> 14:53.667
Rattlesnake to the neck!

14:53.767 --> 14:55.800
I've now been bit, the venom
is coursing through me.

14:55.900 --> 14:57.500
If someone doesn't
suck the venom out soon,

14:57.600 --> 14:59.267
I will have a casualty.
Who, hm?

14:59.367 --> 15:00.533
Who should do it?
Maybe Didi.

15:00.633 --> 15:01.833
Get over here
and work my neck, girl.

15:01.933 --> 15:04.400
- Didi?
Oh, ow! More corn snakes!

15:04.500 --> 15:05.700
Bit me in the neck!
So, Didi, you're gonna

15:05.800 --> 15:07.200
have to suck on my neck too.

15:07.300 --> 15:08.500
- Well, me first
'cause I got bit first, so...

15:08.600 --> 15:10.333
- I need it.

15:10.433 --> 15:12.233
It's been a while since
I've had a snake bite me.

15:12.333 --> 15:13.567
- But I'm a pilot
in the next scene.

15:13.667 --> 15:14.567
I switched with Gary.

15:14.667 --> 15:16.900
- What?
Okay, no recasting.

15:17.067 --> 15:19.067
- What needs sucking?
- Uh...

15:19.100 --> 15:21.100
- Okay, I can see
what you guys are doing

15:21.200 --> 15:22.467
and it is not happening, okay?

15:22.567 --> 15:24.400
We are not going skydiving.

15:24.500 --> 15:26.333
We are going hiking,
and that is final.

15:26.433 --> 15:28.333
- Can you please just be cool
for once in your life?

15:28.433 --> 15:29.833
- Right?
- Try it?

15:29.933 --> 15:31.433
- Okay, do you wanna know
what's cool?

15:31.533 --> 15:33.400
Consistency and leadership.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.900
You think what she does is cool?

15:36.067 --> 15:38.767
She just, like,
goes from job to job

15:38.867 --> 15:41.667
and girl to girl and has
no responsibilities

15:41.767 --> 15:43.233
and isn't tied down.

15:43.333 --> 15:44.900
That's not cool, okay?

15:45.067 --> 15:46.433
- Alice, that's the definition
of cool

15:46.533 --> 15:48.467
and I think
you're just jealous

15:48.567 --> 15:50.767
and it's not
a good look on you.

15:50.867 --> 15:52.433
- I am not jealous.

15:52.533 --> 15:54.500
- Oh, my gosh, this is sad.

15:54.600 --> 15:55.967
You won't even let us
have any fun

15:56.067 --> 15:58.967
just so you can win some
stupid family squabble?

15:59.067 --> 16:02.200
I'm disappointed in you.

16:02.300 --> 16:04.967
- All right. Fine.
Fine, you know what?

16:05.067 --> 16:06.900
You know what,
you're probably right.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.367
All right?
I am not cool.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.467
I'm never gonna be
as cool as Juliette.

16:10.567 --> 16:12.233
She's always been the cool one.

16:12.333 --> 16:14.400
So you know what, if you want
to go and hang out with her

16:14.500 --> 16:17.633
and go skydiving and not
hang out with me on a hike--

16:17.733 --> 16:21.467
your Alice--
fine, I can't stop you.

16:21.567 --> 16:22.733
- Yeah, we do.
- Yeah.

16:22.833 --> 16:23.767
- Sick! All right!
- Awesome.

16:23.867 --> 16:25.133
- Yeah, we did it!

16:25.233 --> 16:27.300
- Okay, so for
the X Games submission,

16:27.400 --> 16:30.400
I'm gonna Roller-skate 2: The
New Class out of an airplane.

16:30.500 --> 16:31.867
That's cool, right?
- Yeah.

16:31.967 --> 16:33.300
- And then I'll be
the first person

16:33.400 --> 16:36.433
to Roller-skate 2:
The New Class midair.

16:36.533 --> 16:37.967
Which is cool, right?
- Yeah.

16:38.067 --> 16:39.567
- Okay, so I need you guys
to help me film it.

16:39.667 --> 16:41.067
- Yeah, I mean, we're in.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.433
I think we're just glad
to see you back

16:42.533 --> 16:44.533
to your good, old,
normal self.

16:44.633 --> 16:45.967
- Oh, well, I didn't die
in my sleep,

16:46.067 --> 16:47.400
which the doctor said
is a good sign.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.067
- Yeah, that is.
- That's huge.

16:49.167 --> 16:51.067
- But I gotta wear this helmet
because evidently,

16:51.133 --> 16:53.067
if I get one more concussion,
I'll get brain damage.

16:53.167 --> 16:54.200
But for now, I'm fine.

16:54.300 --> 16:55.533
- One second.
- Right on.

16:55.633 --> 16:56.800
- Hey, guys,
the van's out back.

16:56.900 --> 16:58.067
- Just save me
a seat next to you.

16:58.167 --> 16:59.767
- I want to sit next to you.

16:59.867 --> 17:01.467
- I don't understand
what the big deal is.

17:01.567 --> 17:03.867
- I'd love to just talk
on the bus.

17:03.967 --> 17:05.300
- No, no, no, this is--

17:05.400 --> 17:07.433
this is fine,
this is just fine.

17:07.533 --> 17:09.067
It's actually very typical
of you.

17:09.133 --> 17:10.500
I mean, you promised
an entire office

17:10.600 --> 17:12.100
that you'd take them skydiving,

17:12.200 --> 17:14.700
and now you're bailing
on them for some girl.

17:14.800 --> 17:17.233
I mean, cool.
- Yeah, what is the problem?

17:17.333 --> 17:18.867
- The problem is is that
the van is going to be here

17:18.967 --> 17:20.100
in five minutes.

17:20.200 --> 17:22.233
What am I supposed
to tell them?

17:22.333 --> 17:24.167
- Make something up.
I don't know.

17:24.267 --> 17:27.667
Tell them that I got my period
and that my tampon will fly out.

17:27.767 --> 17:29.067
- No.

17:29.100 --> 17:32.067
No, I am done
covering for you, okay?

17:32.100 --> 17:34.367
You know what, I really thought
you'd changed.

17:34.467 --> 17:36.533
But you're still the same flake
that you've always been.

17:36.633 --> 17:38.200
- Oh, God.
- And I'm over it.

17:38.300 --> 17:40.067
So get the hell out
of my call center.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.600
- Jesus!

17:41.700 --> 17:43.767
- Ahem.
Uh, attention, everyone.

17:43.867 --> 17:47.333
Uh...unfortunately,
I have some bad news.

17:47.433 --> 17:49.567
Seems that Juliette
is not going to be able

17:49.667 --> 17:51.233
to take you skydiving today.

17:51.333 --> 17:54.067
So, um, she...

17:54.100 --> 17:55.567
started her period.

17:55.667 --> 17:57.500
- Ooh, I know how bad
that can get.

17:57.600 --> 18:00.633
- Well, I mean everybody knows
that at that altitude,

18:00.733 --> 18:02.967
I mean, your tampon
can just fly out of you.

18:03.067 --> 18:04.500
- No, that's true.

18:04.600 --> 18:07.267
A lot of lesbians
have medical issues because

18:07.367 --> 18:08.733
they don't have dicks
inside of them.

18:08.833 --> 18:10.300
- Yeah, sure.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.533
- This is ridiculous!
- I'm sorry, you guys.

18:12.633 --> 18:14.167
- Thanks, Alice.

18:14.267 --> 18:15.633
Real cool.

18:15.733 --> 18:16.800
- But you know what?

18:16.900 --> 18:18.733
Hey, what if I....

18:18.833 --> 18:20.867
I don't know, what if I
take you guys skydiving?

18:20.967 --> 18:23.233
- Okay, are you being serious
right now?

18:23.333 --> 18:24.867
- Yeah.
- Yes! Alice freaking rocks.

18:24.967 --> 18:26.167
- Yeah!
- Alice!

18:26.267 --> 18:29.633
[all chanting]
Alice! Alice! Alice!

18:29.733 --> 18:31.900
- All right, yes, okay,
thank you, that is very sweet.

18:32.067 --> 18:34.633
But let's just get on the van
before I change my mind, okay?

18:34.733 --> 18:36.667
- Shotgun!
- I don't think so.

18:36.767 --> 18:38.200
- Okay.
- Hey, um, Alice?

18:38.300 --> 18:39.467
- We're gonna go skydiving!
- What?

18:39.567 --> 18:40.533
- We heard
the whole conversation

18:40.633 --> 18:42.067
with you and Juliette.

18:42.167 --> 18:44.233
And we know that she's not
on her period.

18:44.333 --> 18:47.067
And it's pretty cool for you
to step up for the office, so...

18:47.100 --> 18:48.533
- Yeah, that's really
freaking cool.

18:48.633 --> 18:50.333
I'd even go to say, uh...

18:50.433 --> 18:52.067
you're the coolest
Murphy sister.

18:52.100 --> 18:54.200
- Thanks, Blake.
- Right?

18:54.300 --> 18:56.067
- Seriously, thank you
for saying that.

18:56.167 --> 18:58.700
That really means
a lot to me.

18:58.800 --> 19:00.367
I just feel like
I've always grown up

19:00.467 --> 19:02.100
in the shadow of my sister.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.133
She always makes me feel
so small, you know?

19:04.233 --> 19:06.800
- [giggling]
- Just makes me feel this big.

19:06.900 --> 19:08.567
- Are you crying
right now?

19:08.667 --> 19:10.533
Oh, my God,
that is so weak!

19:10.633 --> 19:12.700
- Why are you crying?
- That's such a weak emotion.

19:12.800 --> 19:14.567
- Yeah, you cry?
[laughter]

19:14.667 --> 19:16.100
Ew, that's not
a good look on you.

19:16.200 --> 19:17.233
- You got issues.
- Oh, my God.

19:17.333 --> 19:19.200
- Crybaby.

19:19.300 --> 19:20.767
- "My sister!"

19:20.867 --> 19:22.200
No, I want Didi!
- Stop!

19:22.300 --> 19:23.767
- Get out of my way.
- Please, just stop.

19:23.867 --> 19:25.733
I need this, okay?
- Uh, that's my seat.

19:25.833 --> 19:27.533
- That's me.
- What? No.

19:27.633 --> 19:28.733
Sit somewhere else.

19:32.367 --> 19:34.667
- Hey, uh...
- What?

19:37.700 --> 19:39.100
- I brought a kiwi.

19:39.200 --> 19:41.633
If you wanted to,
I don't know, like...

19:41.733 --> 19:43.633
pretend on the way there.

19:43.733 --> 19:45.633
- Great.

19:45.733 --> 19:47.433
- Imagination is
a powerful thing.

19:47.533 --> 19:49.933
[dramatic music]

19:50.067 --> 19:52.600
- Yeah.
Yeah, thanks.

19:52.700 --> 19:54.633
- This could've been you, Didi.

19:54.733 --> 19:56.767
- When you guys are done
finger-banging that kiwi,

19:56.867 --> 19:57.967
can I get it?

19:58.067 --> 19:59.433
I'm starving.

19:59.533 --> 20:01.733
- You got it.

20:01.833 --> 20:03.767
[clears throat]

20:03.867 --> 20:09.767
[The Skinny Boys' "Jock Box"]

20:09.867 --> 20:12.767
[The Skinny Boys' "Jock Box"]

20:12.867 --> 20:14.533
- Okay, you're all set!

20:14.633 --> 20:17.867
- I'm sorry, but isn't it
illegal to allow someone

20:17.967 --> 20:20.233
to jump alone
on their first time?

20:20.333 --> 20:21.933
- Yeah, technically you're
supposed to have

20:22.033 --> 20:24.067
25 jumps in first.

20:24.167 --> 20:26.967
But we're not a legal
skydiving company.

20:27.067 --> 20:29.533
I'm just a chick with a plane
who used to bang your sister!

20:29.633 --> 20:30.633
- What? What?

20:30.733 --> 20:31.867
No! No!

20:31.967 --> 20:33.900
[screams]
- Ooh, whoa!

20:34.000 --> 20:35.300
- All right, who's up next?
- All right!

20:35.400 --> 20:37.033
- Me?
Cool.

20:37.133 --> 20:38.767
- Ooh-rah!
- Okay.

20:38.867 --> 20:40.267
Whoa!

20:40.367 --> 20:42.267
- Whoa!
[laughing]

20:42.367 --> 20:44.267
Jumping, jumping!

20:44.367 --> 20:46.300
- Oh, what am I doing?

20:46.400 --> 20:48.267
They don't even wear helmets
in the X Games.

20:48.367 --> 20:50.600
- Roller-skate guy,
you're up!

20:50.700 --> 20:53.267
- [screaming]

20:53.367 --> 20:54.433
- No!

20:54.533 --> 20:56.267
- My little baby!

20:56.367 --> 20:58.933
[suspenseful music]

20:59.033 --> 21:00.067
- Oh, no, no,
no, no, no.

21:00.100 --> 21:01.367
- Let him land!

21:01.467 --> 21:03.433
Lord, please let him land
in the lake.

Adam!

[screaming]

21:08.667 --> 21:10.567
- Nice!

21:15.467 --> 21:17.367
- They actually--they don't have
the muscles inside

21:17.467 --> 21:19.100
of their vaginas 'cause they're
not used to the penetration

21:19.200 --> 21:21.667
of the penis,
and the vagina grips ahold

21:21.767 --> 21:25.067
of the penis and actually
it forms muscles.

21:25.100 --> 21:26.733
- The vagina, it forms--
- So lesbians--

21:26.833 --> 21:27.800
things just fall out of 'em
all the time.
