Campers and counsellors,
I believe that you will

12:33.253 --> 12:35.920
agree with me
that after last summer's

12:35.922 --> 12:39.824
bold musical re-imagining
of <i> The Vagina Monologues,</i>

12:39.826 --> 12:42.761
this young man has
established himself

12:42.763 --> 12:47.098
as the next Hal Prince.
Here he is now,

12:47.100 --> 12:49.300
the director of this summer's

12:49.302 --> 12:51.736
Limelight showcase,

12:51.738 --> 12:54.139
Artie Getz!

12:59.578 --> 13:01.513
Artie will be announcing

13:01.515 --> 13:03.748
this summer's Limelight production.

13:33.579 --> 13:36.881
<i>Haunting Of The Opera!</i>

13:49.028 --> 13:51.729
I think he thinks it
could help his career.

13:51.731 --> 13:54.632
What career? He hasn't
produced anything in 10 years.

13:54.634 --> 13:56.768
Well, if doing the play
again can help him

13:56.770 --> 13:59.270
get back to New York,
that's a good thing.

13:59.272 --> 14:02.106
- For all of us.
- You always seem to forget:

14:02.108 --> 14:03.808
he's not our father.

14:05.744 --> 14:08.413
Maybe I could even audition.

14:08.415 --> 14:11.149
You actually wanna compete
with those theatre geeks?

14:11.151 --> 14:14.219
Those kids aren't normal, Cam.
Look at them.

14:14.221 --> 14:17.422
The entire musical theatre
canon is just begging -

14:17.424 --> 14:22.393
begging! - for its themes
to be exploded outwards.

14:22.395 --> 14:24.729
Watch, I bet he casts
himself as Alfonso.

14:24.731 --> 14:28.433
Uh, for those of you wondering,
yes, I will be playing Alfonso.

14:28.435 --> 14:31.736
- Yep.
- It's probably 'cause he
wants you to play Opera Ghost.

14:31.738 --> 14:34.739
- Or 'cause he wants
to make out with me again.
- ...which is the very essence

14:34.741 --> 14:38.376
of post-structuralism
in theatre today, and that's why

14:38.378 --> 14:40.745
our production of <i> Haunting...</i>

14:40.747 --> 14:43.414
will take place...

14:43.416 --> 14:45.850

What are you doing here?
Let's go, dinner's at 5.

20:31.731 --> 20:34.398
Hey, Rog, a word? Hey.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.101
Who's directing this show, huh?
We had a deal.

20:37.103 --> 20:39.770
- OK. Shh, shh, shh.
- Full creative control.
That's what we talked about.

20:39.772 --> 20:42.039
OK, OK, shh.

20:42.041 --> 20:45.476
Camilla, you know camp policy.

20:45.478 --> 20:48.045
I can't start making exceptions...

20:48.047 --> 20:50.047
I know, I know.

20:50.049 --> 20:51.983
And you never have,

20:51.985 --> 20:53.584
but this...

20:53.586 --> 20:56.053
is different.

20:56.055 --> 20:59.023
- Your mother's role?
- You said yourself

20:59.025 --> 21:01.225
she would be proud.

21:09.234 --> 21:11.002
I will allow the audition.

21:13.639 --> 21:15.373
But she will be

21:15.375 --> 21:19.477
treated like every other camper.
There is a process.

21:19.479 --> 21:23.014
This is bullshit!

21:58.751 --> 22:00.751
Let me see! Move!

22:00.753 --> 22:05.323
You two, I knew you were
gonna get them. I knew it!

22:37.522 --> 22:39.824
That is her.
She's one of the cooks.

22:41.727 --> 22:45.229
- Buddy!
- Congratulations.

- Those what?

23:11.890 --> 23:13.624
Mom was a theatre geek.

23:13.626 --> 23:15.793
Kylie Swanson slept with
so many people on Broadway

23:15.795 --> 23:17.995
they called her
The Great White Lay.

23:17.997 --> 23:20.765

<i>Welcome to</i>

25:41.774 --> 25:44.875
Limelight!

25:44.877 --> 25:46.877
For those of you who are new,

25:46.879 --> 25:49.213
I'm your stage manager,
David Martin.

25:49.215 --> 25:52.316
I'm here to make sure that
the show goes on no matter what,

25:52.318 --> 25:53.751
and I will do

25:53.753 --> 25:56.053
whatever it takes.

25:56.055 --> 25:58.289
Well, except go on stage -
I don't do that.

25:58.291 --> 26:01.692
Hello, stage fright.

26:01.694 --> 26:06.130
But backstage, make no mistake: I run
the space and you will feel my wrath.

26:06.132 --> 26:08.132
J/K, I love you guys.

26:08.134 --> 26:11.268
- Oh, my god!
- But there is a process,

26:11.270 --> 26:14.238
and without further ado,
Herr Director.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.240
Woo!

26:16.242 --> 26:18.576
Woo!

26:18.578 --> 26:21.345
What is at the heart of <i> Haunting?</i>

26:23.415 --> 26:27.184
- A love thtory about...
- It's about covering.

26:27.186 --> 26:30.554
Covering up who you really are.

26:30.556 --> 26:33.257
And isn't that the scariest

26:33.259 --> 26:36.527
thing of all? That's why I'm
going to reinvent this entire

26:36.529 --> 26:38.963
production and cover it

26:38.965 --> 26:41.699
with a postmodern face.
Now, who can tell me...

26:41.701 --> 26:45.235
what Japanese tradition
involves covering...

26:45.237 --> 26:48.472
your face all in white?

26:48.474 --> 26:51.976
Bukkake.

26:51.978 --> 26:53.777
Kabuki?

26:53.779 --> 26:59.216
And that is why my version
of Opera Ghost will wear

26:59.218 --> 27:01.218
not just any mask,

27:01.220 --> 27:03.253
but a kabuki mask.

27:03.255 --> 27:05.155
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you

27:05.157 --> 27:07.491
the new face of <i> Opera Ghost.</i>
Whitney?

27:22.107 --> 27:25.142
OK, everybody. That's it.
Remember: off-book by Thursday.

27:25.144 --> 27:27.511
Camilla, do you have a second?

27:27.513 --> 27:29.580
I want to show you something.

27:53.972 --> 27:56.473

27:56.475 --> 27:59.943

yesterday.

28:01.880 --> 28:03.847

28:03.849 --> 28:07.251

if I go back to my bunk now?

39:02.740 --> 39:06.376
Are you gonna be mad if I put
Liz onstage tomorrow night?

39:12.116 --> 39:14.484
Disgusting. Ugh.

39:16.922 --> 39:19.456
No, but really, it's a tough call.

39:19.458 --> 39:21.391
Screw you!

39:23.327 --> 39:26.396
I'll lock up! Psh.

39:30.735 --> 39:32.302
Cam?

39:38.176 --> 39:39.976
Cam, is that you?

39:50.088 --> 39:52.055
Cam?

39:52.057 --> 39:55.058
Artieeeeee.

39:55.060 --> 39:56.826
Is that you?

40:01.900 --> 40:05.568
Artieeeeee.

41:14.738 --> 41:17.307
Ah!

41:28.152 --> 41:31.254
- Break a leg!
- Ahhh!

41:43.300 --> 41:48.638
<i>♪ Hallelujah ♪</i>

42:27.311 --> 42:31.481
Yeahhhhhhh!

43:00.544 --> 43:05.081
- There has been an accident.
- I heard a light fell on him.

43:05.083 --> 43:07.617
Cam. Camilla.

43:07.619 --> 43:10.286
I heard his foot was ripped off.

43:10.288 --> 43:12.255
What happened?

43:12.257 --> 43:14.257
Bunk 8 campers found

43:14.259 --> 43:16.893
Artie Getz in pieces
on the stage this morning.

43:22.232 --> 43:26.169
Roger's calling it an accident,
but Sam's costume is missing.

43:26.171 --> 43:29.672
Cam, do you think this is
connected to your mom?

43:29.674 --> 43:32.375
What?

43:32.377 --> 43:34.277
Maybe this show is cursed.

43:34.279 --> 43:36.980
McCall tries to produce this
10 years ago

43:36.982 --> 43:39.382
and his starlet is killed
on opening night.

43:39.384 --> 43:42.151
He tries again,
and the director gets killed.

43:42.153 --> 43:44.187
Maybe there's somebody out there

43:44.189 --> 43:47.857
that really doesn't want him
to put on this play.

43:47.859 --> 43:51.194
Like I said before,

43:51.196 --> 43:54.631
the sheriff is on his way.

43:56.734 --> 43:59.869
I can make you this promise:
that whatever

43:59.871 --> 44:03.706
that accident was,
it will not occur again.

44:03.708 --> 44:05.274
Hey.

44:11.081 --> 44:12.815
You OK?

44:15.052 --> 44:17.053
I told you not to get
involved with their crowd

44:17.055 --> 44:20.023
- in the first place.
- What does that have to do with anything?

44:20.025 --> 44:23.192
Nothing! I'm just saying, this summer, ever
since you decided to be in their show...

44:23.194 --> 44:25.228
I just thought I should try it.

44:29.033 --> 44:31.934
I think about Mom a lot,

44:31.936 --> 44:33.936
and when I got my chance

44:33.938 --> 44:36.372
and I was up there,
singing her songs,

44:36.374 --> 44:40.176
for the first time in my life
I thought,

44:40.178 --> 44:42.679
"Maybe this is what I'm
supposed to do".

44:45.082 --> 44:48.751
I don't expect you to know
what I'm talking about.

44:52.656 --> 44:54.757
I do.

44:54.759 --> 44:56.759
I saw you rehearse.

44:56.761 --> 45:00.263
You were good.

45:00.265 --> 45:02.265
You think so?

45:02.267 --> 45:04.000
Yeah.

45:04.002 --> 45:06.069
Really good.

45:10.007 --> 45:12.975
Right now I just want to leave.

45:12.977 --> 45:15.978
This camp, the play, everything.

45:20.417 --> 45:22.185
So let's go.

45:30.128 --> 45:33.896
No. No, no, no.
David, control them.

45:33.898 --> 45:36.966
I gotta call the sheriff.
I gotta call the sheriff!

45:49.747 --> 45:52.949
Fuck. Fuck!

45:52.951 --> 45:55.518
Ah! Oh.

46:00.057 --> 46:02.558
- Center Stage.
- Roger McCall, please.

46:02.560 --> 46:04.894
Who am I speaking with?

46:04.896 --> 46:06.395
Victor Brady,

46:06.397 --> 46:09.031
42nd Street Productions.
Who am I speaking with?

46:10.968 --> 46:14.537
Oh, Mr. Brady. This is Roger
McCall. Thank you so much.

46:14.539 --> 46:16.539
I don't know if you remember me
or not...

46:16.541 --> 46:18.040
Yes, I do recall.

46:18.042 --> 46:20.243
So, tell me about this showcase
you have planned.

46:20.245 --> 46:22.879
We're reviving <i> Haunting.</i>

46:22.881 --> 46:26.015
It is set in feudal Japan,
it is kabuki...

46:26.017 --> 46:27.550
Did you say kabuki?

46:30.187 --> 46:31.687
Uh...

46:33.658 --> 46:35.391
Oh, that's a riot.

46:35.393 --> 46:38.795
Yes, sir, what a riot!

46:38.797 --> 46:41.998
But, sir, you'll be blown away
by this cast.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.466
I need to talk to you.

46:43.468 --> 46:46.169
Is that so?
Who's your Sofia?

46:46.171 --> 46:49.505
I mean, I hate to stoke
the fires, but...

46:49.507 --> 46:53.543
I always felt that if Kylie Swanson
hadn't been killed that night,

46:53.545 --> 46:56.012
the show would've run
a lot longer than it did.

46:58.549 --> 47:00.716
Of course.

47:00.718 --> 47:02.718
I agree.

47:02.720 --> 47:06.722
But we have the perfect
successor: her daughter,

47:06.724 --> 47:08.357
Camilla.

47:08.359 --> 47:11.227
Tonight at eight?

47:11.229 --> 47:13.229
My assistant has the address?

47:13.231 --> 47:15.898
- Yes, sir. Of course, sir.
- See you then.

47:20.470 --> 47:22.772
Camilla, I think you need

47:22.774 --> 47:25.641
to get some rest before
your big performance tonight.

47:29.213 --> 47:31.214
Buddy and I are moving out.

47:31.216 --> 47:34.217
Do you know who was on that phone?

47:34.219 --> 47:36.085
That was Victor Brady,

47:36.087 --> 47:39.722
42nd Street Productions,
and he's coming tonight

47:39.724 --> 47:41.524
to see you.

47:41.526 --> 47:44.861
Well, he's just gonna have
to see Liz instead.

47:44.863 --> 47:47.930
I know you're still shaken
about the accident...

47:47.932 --> 47:50.299
No, it's not that. I just...

47:50.301 --> 47:53.603
I've just realized that
this whole thing is not for me.

47:55.539 --> 48:00.176
Camilla, what about everything
you've worked so hard on?

48:00.178 --> 48:01.777
What about Artie?

48:04.381 --> 48:05.948
What about him?

48:08.752 --> 48:11.454
He wanted you to play Sofia.

48:11.456 --> 48:14.423
He always did.
He told me so.

48:14.425 --> 48:16.125
No, he didn't.

48:16.127 --> 48:17.627
He did.

48:17.629 --> 48:20.029
He told me...

48:20.031 --> 48:23.032
he'd seen you transform
on that stage

48:23.034 --> 48:27.270
as if you were meant to be Sofia.

48:27.272 --> 48:30.773
But, of course... you get it

48:30.775 --> 48:32.541
from your mother.

48:34.478 --> 48:37.647
Take tonight.

48:37.649 --> 48:40.149
Give Sofia one last chance.

48:40.151 --> 48:42.885
I'm calling my mom back!

48:42.887 --> 48:45.521
No, no, please.
No, no, no, no.

48:45.523 --> 48:47.657
If I don't call my dad,
he is going to kill me!

48:47.659 --> 48:50.860
- Get them down and get them to shut up.
- Quiet!

48:53.530 --> 48:55.998
Quiet!

48:56.000 --> 48:57.967
Thank you.

49:00.671 --> 49:03.105
So, is Limelight cancelled?

49:08.578 --> 49:11.380
You have a decision to make:

49:11.382 --> 49:14.016
if you go in

49:14.018 --> 49:16.018
and use that phone,

49:16.020 --> 49:18.020
the show's over,

49:18.022 --> 49:19.722
camp's over,

49:19.724 --> 49:21.991
and you go home -

49:21.993 --> 49:23.993
to your parents.

49:23.995 --> 49:26.629
Unless!

49:29.232 --> 49:32.234
Unless we wait.

49:32.236 --> 49:34.737
One day.

49:34.739 --> 49:36.305
Just one more day.

49:38.241 --> 49:42.411
And we do the show,
as planned, tonight.

49:42.413 --> 49:44.680
But...

49:44.682 --> 49:47.249
isn't it wrong to sing and dance

49:47.251 --> 49:50.386
- when someone just died?
- Yeah.

49:50.388 --> 49:55.157
- Isn't that illegal?
- What about the sheriff?

50:01.565 --> 50:04.066
Do you remember the first time

50:04.068 --> 50:06.502
you ever saw a musical play?

50:08.672 --> 50:12.408
Do you remember the first time
that you ever got swept away?

50:12.410 --> 50:16.746
No matter what bad stuff
happened that day,

50:16.748 --> 50:20.683
when that show was over,
you probably felt OK.

50:20.685 --> 50:22.618
That's why

50:22.620 --> 50:26.956
theatre has been around so long.

50:26.958 --> 50:31.560
That's why we need musical songs.

50:31.562 --> 50:35.564

You sure about this?

53:39.483 --> 53:43.552
I'm still gonna move out
with you - don't worry.

53:43.554 --> 53:46.522
Is the prima donna ready?

53:46.524 --> 53:49.124
I found ginger and
lemon, but no honey.

53:49.126 --> 53:51.794
Oh, I got us covered.
Come on.

54:11.448 --> 54:14.383
- Where's the stage manager?
- Right here, sir.

54:14.385 --> 54:17.686
This is a real opportunity
for you to step it up.

54:17.688 --> 54:20.456
We're all counting on you.

54:20.458 --> 54:22.424
You take this show

54:22.426 --> 54:25.094
all the way to the curtain call,
got it?

54:25.096 --> 54:27.196
You got it.

55:12.742 --> 55:14.910
David Martin to Joel.

55:14.912 --> 55:17.012
Where are you, Joel?

55:17.014 --> 55:18.580
Joel?

55:22.552 --> 55:26.422
I wanna make sure you know
how to be your best, so:

55:26.424 --> 55:29.425
throat coat. Performers' secret.

55:29.427 --> 55:32.361
Before all your big solos,
for sure.

55:32.363 --> 55:36.832
Honey. Just eat
the whole thing. Mmm.

55:36.834 --> 55:39.902
Hey! You can't do the show tonight.

55:39.904 --> 55:43.005
Get out, Joel, we're warming up.

55:45.242 --> 55:48.243
Cam, come on, you have
to listen to me OK?

55:48.245 --> 55:50.179
There is a killer at this camp.

55:50.181 --> 55:54.416
- Zeeeaaaayyyyy, ahhhh...
- Would you shut up?!

55:54.418 --> 55:56.518
You're not listening.

55:58.955 --> 56:00.622
Artie was killed.

56:00.624 --> 56:02.624
Get out, Joel.

56:02.626 --> 56:05.327
Warming up is, like,
really important!

56:12.302 --> 56:14.670
Now, my vocal coach taught me
this trick.

56:14.672 --> 56:16.805
You steam up the whole room,

56:16.807 --> 56:20.809
and then you can come in here at
any point in the show and just,
like, moisten your vocal cords.

56:22.480 --> 56:26.548
Eeeeaaayyyy, eeeayyyyy, ahhhh!

56:31.087 --> 56:32.755
Joel?

56:32.757 --> 56:37.092
Last call for Joel Hopton.
Is anyone using these things?

56:37.094 --> 56:38.594
Hello?

56:38.596 --> 56:41.029
Nice!

56:41.031 --> 56:45.634
Oh, awesome work, Whitney.
It's good as new. OK,

56:45.636 --> 56:47.603
you can't be here during the show.

56:47.605 --> 56:49.605
I have a quick-change
and I need this area clear.

56:49.607 --> 56:55.544
So, just do your janitor thing
somewhere else, all right?

<i>- You shouldn't be here, Buddy.</i>

01:13:19.763 --> 01:13:22.397
I told you not to come in here,

01:13:22.399 --> 01:13:24.399
but you didn't listen

01:13:24.401 --> 01:13:26.734
and your mother had an accident

01:14:09.345 --> 01:14:10.912

01:18:57.900 --> 01:19:00.401

Oh-ho-ho. Oh, Cammy,

01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:13.380
- don't be silly. Put that down.
- No!

01:19:13.382 --> 01:19:17.318
Put that down. I'm not
gonna hurt my little star.

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:21.789
I'm not gonna hurt my sweet
little Broadway star.

01:19:21.791 --> 01:19:23.691
No!

01:19:23.693 --> 01:19:26.527

01:19:30.566 --> 01:19:33.033

01:19:35.337 --> 01:19:38.472

01:21:41.230 --> 01:21:43.831
Wooo!

01:22:10.159 --> 01:22:14.995
We are here for the opening night of the
Broadway revival of <i> The Haunting of the Opera</i>

01:22:14.997 --> 01:22:16.563
and curtain is about to go up.

01:22:16.565 --> 01:22:19.733
Now, it's been a year
since the Center Stage massacre.

01:22:19.735 --> 01:22:21.902
What can you tell us?

01:22:21.904 --> 01:22:25.906
Well, it's like I've said
to Camilla since day one:

01:22:25.908 --> 01:22:27.908
you can't change the past.

01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:30.010
As much as you may want to,
you can't.

01:22:30.012 --> 01:22:33.147
But what you can do,
to move forward,

01:22:33.149 --> 01:22:36.083
is to do just this: a musical.

01:22:36.085 --> 01:22:39.887
And if you don't do it,
someone else will.

01:22:41.923 --> 01:22:44.625
Knock, knock!

01:22:44.627 --> 01:22:46.627
Hey guess what?

01:22:46.629 --> 01:22:49.797
The <i> Times</i> showed up,
and the President of the NYDCC.

01:22:52.901 --> 01:22:55.803
Hey. You all right?

01:22:58.239 --> 01:23:00.240
I'll be fine.

01:23:00.242 --> 01:23:02.076
Atta girl.

01:23:02.078 --> 01:23:05.012
Don't forget,
the party's tonight, OK?

01:23:05.014 --> 01:23:07.081
We're gonna celebrate.

01:23:10.251 --> 01:23:13.654
Sweetheart, you're gonna
be great. I know it.
