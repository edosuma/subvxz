to do something great, something unique,

02:45.750 --> 02:49.721
something that only you were born to do.

02:49.821 --> 02:53.124
Only you can give.
So, what is your calling?

02:53.224 --> 02:54.726
I definitely know what mine is.

02:54.826 --> 02:58.396
This show is about helping
all of you who are watching us.

02:58.496 --> 03:02.306
Think about and then figure out,
'cause that's your real job, to figure out

03:02.406 --> 03:05.437
what is your calling,
and then begin to honor it.

03:05.537 --> 03:07.293
Hundreds of people in this audience...

04:07.064 --> 04:10.004
I'm going to have to check on her. Yeah.

04:20.353 --> 04:24.049
I should... head out.
I'm... It was nice to meet you.

04:24.149 --> 04:26.584
- Alice.
- Alice.

04:26.684 --> 04:28.687
Take care, Alice.

04:31.121 --> 04:33.558
- Who was that?
- I don't know.

04:33.658 --> 04:37.229
She asked if there was a rape
in A Tale of Two Cities.

04:38.129 --> 04:40.232
<i>If maybe, well, one that's just for you.</i>

04:40.332 --> 04:43.268
<i>Just a phone call, but hopefully
a new start for your friendships.</i>

04:43.368 --> 04:45.771
<i>And hopefully those of you
who haven't made the call,</i>

04:45.871 --> 04:48.590
<i>in six years, ten years, twelve,
will get the nerve from this show</i>

04:48.690 --> 04:52.674

Do that for yourself.</i>

06:32.111 --> 06:34.913

06:35.013 --> 06:40.001
<i>If you're calling to report a winning,

06:56.533 --> 06:59.764
<i>Yesterday was a very lucky day
for Alice Klieg,</i>

06:59.864 --> 07:02.007
<i>a Palm Desert woman
who holds the winning ticket</i>

07:02.107 --> 07:06.277
<i>for an $86 million California

07:06.377 --> 07:10.770
Oh, my... That's my...
That's my friend! Oh, my God!

07:11.587 --> 07:14.380
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

07:14.480 --> 07:17.022
<i>I'd like to read
from a prepared statement.</i>

07:17.122 --> 07:22.427
<i>I was a summer baby, born in the year
1971 in Simi Valley, California.</i>

07:22.727 --> 07:26.431
<i>My mother was a nutritionist
and my father was a commercial baker.</i>

07:26.731 --> 07:29.699
<i>And I've been using masturbation
as a sedative since 1991.</i>

07:32.236 --> 07:34.719
<i>We're unable to show you the rest.</i>

07:34.819 --> 07:36.541
<i>Yesterday was a...</i>

07:37.165 --> 07:39.199
They cut me off.

07:42.913 --> 07:44.315
- Hello?
- What...

07:44.415 --> 07:47.452
Hi, Ted. Alice, it's Ted.

07:47.978 --> 07:49.654
He saw you on the news.

07:49.754 --> 07:53.091
- They cut me off.
- Yeah, she's mad they cut her speech off.

07:53.191 --> 07:57.102
- <i>She sounds bad.</i>
- She's about a 7.5 and climbing.

07:58.729 --> 08:00.551
- <i>You don't have to stay.</i>
- Somebody has to stay.

08:00.651 --> 08:03.835
- They cut me off.
- Okay. Later, tater.

08:05.188 --> 08:06.989
Alice?

08:10.541 --> 08:12.846
You hungry?

08:12.946 --> 08:15.454
I'm going to take an iodine bath.

08:39.736 --> 08:44.008
It's my new thing. I'm managing my moods
by living a high protein lifestyle.

08:45.242 --> 08:47.095
What's going on with the Abilify?

08:51.515 --> 08:53.156
I have a prepared statement.

08:54.581 --> 08:56.615
Okay.

08:59.256 --> 09:02.560
"Dear Daryl, it's been
a good run, Daryl,

09:02.660 --> 09:06.864
"but as I will no longer be collecting
disability from the State of California,

09:06.964 --> 09:09.834
"our visits are no longer mandatory.

09:09.934 --> 09:12.537
"I appreciate everything
you have done for me,

09:12.637 --> 09:14.672
"but as a new member
of the rich and famous,

09:14.772 --> 09:17.690
I simply don't have time for the pain."

09:20.043 --> 09:23.245
Well, I have something
I'd like to read, too.

09:24.915 --> 09:26.057
"My dear Alice,

09:26.257 --> 09:30.259
I would be happy to discuss the logistical
details of our new relationship,

09:30.859 --> 09:33.929
"a relationship which gives me great pride
when I reflect on the ground

09:34.029 --> 09:35.311
that we have covered.

09:35.411 --> 09:39.770
"Since the psycho-pharmacological
value of string cheese in the treatment

"I would encourage you to reconsider
walking away from the good

09:49.529 --> 09:52.885
and necessary work that we do."

09:53.411 --> 09:55.928
Why did you stop your medication?

09:56.028 --> 09:58.252
It's a new era.

09:59.416 --> 10:02.101
Eighty-six million-dollar Alice.

10:05.256 --> 10:07.158
Do you really want to stop seeing me?

10:07.758 --> 10:09.584
No.

10:11.042 --> 10:12.930
Yes.

10:14.751 --> 10:15.681
No.

10:18.668 --> 10:21.437
What do you want to do, Alice?

10:24.774 --> 10:27.144
Something really big.

10:27.644 --> 10:30.414
I'm moving today.

10:32.180 --> 10:34.039
Nice.

10:34.139 --> 10:35.771
Good.

10:38.355 --> 10:40.874
If I paid you...

10:42.292 --> 10:45.890
would you give me
a clean-bill health, mentally?

11:14.925 --> 11:16.894
Thanks for choosing
our casino, Miss Klieg.

11:17.256 --> 11:21.210
- So, how long do you plan on staying?
- Indefinitely.

11:21.310 --> 11:22.669
Do you allow pets here?

11:22.769 --> 11:24.402
Well, I'm sure we can work
something out.

11:24.502 --> 11:26.575
- Do you have a dog?
- No.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.250
What's the matter, sweetie?

11:39.350 --> 11:41.720
<i>Located at the beautiful
Palm Springs area.</i>

11:42.920 --> 11:44.665
Nothing.

11:50.306 --> 11:54.284
What I'm suggesting,
is a more of a less idea.

11:54.984 --> 11:57.635
A five-dollar tip for you.

11:57.935 --> 12:02.673
Just ask Ted for a little advice,
small amount,

12:02.773 --> 12:06.352
- about what to do with your money.
- I don't need any help, Mommy.

12:07.378 --> 12:11.743
No hand? Oh, thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

12:13.202 --> 12:14.850
- Sorry, Mom.
- It's all right.

12:16.491 --> 12:18.393
Teddy.

12:19.099 --> 12:22.480
- Welcome to my new home.
- This must be your Alice.

12:22.580 --> 12:25.297
- This is Derick.
- Hi, it's so nice to fina... Okay.

12:26.497 --> 12:28.366
This is... this is my best friend, Gina.

12:28.466 --> 12:31.776
- I'm her Gina. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

12:32.737 --> 12:35.540
Those two sour pussies
over there are my parents.

12:35.640 --> 12:38.480
This is Derick, Ted's male lover.
Isn't that good?

12:38.580 --> 12:41.179
- Hi, hi.
- Hi.

12:42.008 --> 12:45.567
If it weren't for you,
I don't know what we would do.

12:47.617 --> 12:50.121
- I always knew about Ted.
- What?

12:50.221 --> 12:52.741
When we were married.
By the way he fucked me.

12:54.959 --> 12:56.287
I get it.

12:58.728 --> 13:00.364
So...

13:00.464 --> 13:03.743
how does it feel to be a millionaire?

13:05.168 --> 13:07.694
I have a prepared statement.

13:07.794 --> 13:10.732
Prepared statement.

13:11.574 --> 13:13.384
Okay.

13:17.013 --> 13:19.070
Here's what I want to say.

13:20.024 --> 13:23.141
Cause. Okay?

13:23.241 --> 13:26.157
Effect. Okay?

13:26.257 --> 13:28.226
"I want each of you
to understand that...

13:28.326 --> 13:31.229
"you can have what I have right now
if you really believe it.

13:31.929 --> 13:35.957
- You too can have a new life."
- New life.

13:36.057 --> 13:38.100
New life.

13:40.570 --> 13:42.373
"And as I begin my new life,

13:42.473 --> 13:46.677
I must reflect on the love and inspiration
each of you has given me."

13:47.827 --> 13:51.382
I love you, guys.
Shit, I didn't want to cry until the end.

13:51.482 --> 13:55.707
A toast to Alice and her new life.

13:55.807 --> 13:58.966
New life.

13:59.066 --> 14:01.077
To my new life.

14:02.626 --> 14:04.719
Let's hope.

14:15.104 --> 14:16.641
I'm going to get shrimp.

14:16.891 --> 14:19.477
<i>...it's harvested in Ecuador,</i>

14:19.577 --> 14:22.265
<i>where the locals call it</i> La Madre

<i>or The Mother.</i>

14:24.515 --> 14:28.625
<i>Smoothies are such a great way
to load up on powerful nutrition.</i>

14:28.725 --> 14:32.018
<i>Every single particle of Live Alchemy

14:32.118 --> 14:34.850
<i>that actually rewrite your DNA.</i>

14:34.950 --> 14:37.226
<i>So, who's ready for a new life?</i>

14:39.030 --> 14:42.952
<i>This has been a live broadcast from the
headquarters of New Vibrance Studios.</i>

<i>Live for Palm Desert, California,
welcome to Live Alchemy.</i>

14:54.695 --> 14:58.693
You can't put yogurt
in waste baskets. Okay?

14:59.249 --> 15:03.924
I know, but then, you can't just
let it be there. It's disgusting.

15:06.324 --> 15:09.349
Good to see you.
Welcome to Live Alchemy.

15:09.449 --> 15:10.739
I'm Gabe Ruskin.

15:10.939 --> 15:13.370
Now, what if I were to tell you

15:13.470 --> 15:18.121
<i>one teaspoon of Live Alchemy
contains more usable protein</i>

15:18.221 --> 15:20.471
<i>than a 16-ounce sirloin steak.</i>

15:20.671 --> 15:23.574
- Well, get ready to pan to the audience.
- <i>It's true. What if I were to tell you...</i>

15:23.674 --> 15:28.512
...that in 100 years, our main source
of food would be algae?

15:28.946 --> 15:30.813
Now.

15:31.257 --> 15:33.404
I would believe it.

15:33.504 --> 15:35.717
Hey, hey, wow. We got a live one.

15:37.221 --> 15:40.286
And I wouldn't lie to you. Now...

15:40.386 --> 15:44.762
<i>We're all used to healthy food
tasting like dirt, right?</i>

15:44.862 --> 15:46.347
Frank, pull away please.

15:46.447 --> 15:49.222
<i>Right, I mean, it's really bad. Well...</i>

15:49.322 --> 15:50.901
I'd like to get a volunteer
from the audience

15:51.001 --> 15:55.339
to come taste my chocolate amaretto
smoothie with Live Alchemy.

15:55.439 --> 15:57.533
Who's curious?

15:58.976 --> 16:02.836
No, no. Come on.
Not the crazy bitch. Gabe.

16:02.936 --> 16:07.519
Who's game? You want to come up?
Right up here. Welcome. Yeah, it's good.

16:08.419 --> 16:10.955
Thanks for being brave, yeah.

16:11.355 --> 16:13.864
Very courageous of you.

16:20.864 --> 16:23.233
Would you believe me?

16:24.918 --> 16:29.504
Most people, they hear "algae"
and they say "yuck".

16:31.390 --> 16:34.812
I'm not afraid of anything, Gabe.
Including success.

16:35.312 --> 16:37.281
Oh, what's your name?

16:37.381 --> 16:39.201
My name is Alice Klieg.

16:39.501 --> 16:41.784
I watch you when I sleep.

16:43.882 --> 16:45.356
What... what was that?

16:45.756 --> 16:47.811
<i>Is that so?</i>

16:54.030 --> 16:55.733
This is my second time on TV this week.

16:56.233 --> 16:58.542
- Oh, your second time, really?
- Yes, Gabe.

16:58.852 --> 17:03.379
I won the California Stack Sweepstakes.
Eighty-six million dollars.

17:07.609 --> 17:10.714
I did a press conference that aired
on all of the stations in this area.

17:10.814 --> 17:12.916
That's incredible. You are a lucky lady.

17:13.017 --> 17:16.053
And we're lucky to have you here
to be our guinea pig to try...

17:16.153 --> 17:18.888
- Winning has nothing to do with luck.
- It doesn't?

17:19.289 --> 17:21.325
<i>No. It's all mental training.</i>

17:21.974 --> 17:24.060
Dawn, what the hell?

17:24.161 --> 17:27.018
Well, why don't you ask your brother?
He seems to be...

17:27.117 --> 17:30.701
- Are we in control here or what?
- Not currently.

17:30.901 --> 17:35.339
Oprah says that everything in our world
is created on a DNA level by what we think.

17:35.439 --> 17:38.907
I thought I was a winner.
I won $86 million.

17:43.312 --> 17:45.629
- All right, give me the word, Rich.
- Wait.

17:46.129 --> 17:49.020
- <i>That is just great.</i>
- <i>I didn't always think of myself as a winner.</i>

17:49.520 --> 17:51.925
When I was 16, I was diagnosed
with manic depression.

17:53.491 --> 17:56.460
In my 20s, it was called
rapid cycling bipolar disorder.

17:57.636 --> 18:00.798
Now it's just called
borderline personality disorder.

18:01.493 --> 18:04.032
- Alice, maybe come back to your seat.
- No!

18:07.871 --> 18:11.585
Now it's just called
borderline personality disorder.

18:11.685 --> 18:13.945
Who can keep up?

18:14.545 --> 18:18.779
For most of my life,
I let my diagnosis define who I was.

18:18.879 --> 18:20.752
Big mistake.

18:20.852 --> 18:25.956
At a certain point, I realized I had
to get back to me... before my illness.

18:26.480 --> 18:27.927
Oh, my God.

18:29.293 --> 18:32.406
Oh, my... Why are we following her?

18:37.800 --> 18:42.940
I was a summer baby born in 1971
in Simi Valley, California.

18:43.240 --> 18:45.843
<i>And I've been using masturbation
as a sedative since 1991.</i>

18:45.943 --> 18:48.846
- We have to kill this, Rich.
- Okay, kill it.

18:48.946 --> 18:51.549
- Kill it, please.
- <i>My father was a commercial baker.</i>

18:51.649 --> 18:55.219
<i>Introducing Essentis,
luxury hair care system</i>

18:55.319 --> 18:57.688
<i>formulated with natural
and organic components...</i>

18:58.088 --> 19:00.924
Do you think she really won the lottery?

19:01.024 --> 19:04.695
Seriously. Can someone Google that?
What was her name?

19:05.733 --> 19:10.567
Oh, my God. Gabe, that was the best
experience of my whole entire life.

19:11.728 --> 19:13.904
You didn't have to buy me out.

19:14.004 --> 19:15.562
I need the protein.

19:15.662 --> 19:17.575
Hey.

19:17.675 --> 19:20.344
You must be the big winner.
Hi, I'm Rich.

19:20.444 --> 19:21.887
Me, too.

19:21.987 --> 19:24.215
I'm Gabe's brother.

19:24.315 --> 19:28.249
- So, you own all of this?
- Gabe and I sure do, yeah.

19:29.652 --> 19:34.224
- I have an idea for a show.
- What kind of show?

19:34.324 --> 19:35.659
How about this?
You want to come in tomorrow,

19:35.759 --> 19:37.428
we'll sit down,
we have an official meeting,

19:37.528 --> 19:40.965
and we can hear all about this show
of yours. I'm sure it's a knockout.

19:41.065 --> 19:42.800
- Okay, yeah.
- Does that sound good?

19:42.900 --> 19:44.034
- Yeah.
- Great.

19:44.634 --> 19:48.370
It's a mindset, right?
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

19:53.377 --> 19:55.746
Anything she wants.

19:56.346 --> 19:58.364
Anything.

19:58.464 --> 19:59.646
Okay.

19:59.746 --> 20:02.500
You realize that's where we are, right?

20:02.600 --> 20:04.751
It's that bad?

20:05.623 --> 20:09.627
We run a company together.
Jesus Christ, where the hell are you?

20:09.727 --> 20:14.042
- Wait. I thought we were doing okay.
- We were doing okay in the '90s.

20:14.142 --> 20:17.350
Not so much now. We're going to have
to start laying people off again.

20:17.450 --> 20:18.715
No, no.

20:19.670 --> 20:22.773
So, they thought I had this virus
that only cats get,

20:23.550 --> 20:26.043
but it turned out to just be IBS.

20:27.001 --> 20:29.380
So I couldn't have any orgasms.

20:30.691 --> 20:34.281
I was in the hospital for three weeks.

20:35.518 --> 20:37.652
But I feel so much better now.

20:39.655 --> 20:42.693
That is so great, Alice.

20:42.793 --> 20:44.777
- Should I just bring it in?
- Sure.

20:44.877 --> 20:47.397
Great. Pastrami's mine.

20:48.758 --> 20:50.298
Why don't we get to your idea?

20:53.235 --> 20:55.804
I want a talk show with me as the host.

20:57.607 --> 21:02.820
Okay. Well, it wouldn't... be our
first foray into vanity programming.

21:02.920 --> 21:05.616
That's true. Last year
we did that hobby show.

21:05.716 --> 21:07.551
I think Alice wants
to take over for Oprah.

21:09.367 --> 21:11.021
- Good deal.
- That's crazy.

21:11.121 --> 21:13.924
So, you want to talk
about current events?

21:14.424 --> 21:15.460
No.

21:15.560 --> 21:18.985
A show with guests and do interviews?

21:19.085 --> 21:20.048
No.

21:20.156 --> 21:21.963
What kind of stuff
do you want to talk about?

21:23.699 --> 21:25.953
Me.

21:26.053 --> 21:28.539
I'm still not getting
what the show is going to be.

21:28.639 --> 21:30.273
Let me, Deb.

21:30.373 --> 21:35.190
Alice directing, shooting, editing,
sets, costume design,

21:35.290 --> 21:36.814
- hair and makeup.
- Yeah. I want all that.

21:36.914 --> 21:41.221
All these things add up to making,
creating your own show extremely expensive.

21:41.321 --> 21:43.987
Yeah, particularly when you're not
offsetting those costs

21:44.087 --> 21:45.956
with income from selling products.

21:46.056 --> 21:48.993
- Are we talking about a half hour or...
- Two hours.

21:49.993 --> 21:54.214
- How much would that cost?
- Two hours?

21:54.314 --> 21:56.470
You're looking at $100,000 an episode.

21:56.570 --> 21:59.300
I'd say more like 150.

22:04.006 --> 22:06.574
And that times a hundred would be...

22:08.077 --> 22:10.204
That's $15 million.

22:10.304 --> 22:12.580
$15 million.

22:20.590 --> 22:23.180
My business stuff.

22:42.978 --> 22:46.180
Oh, and I want to come in
on a swan boat.

22:56.025 --> 22:57.661
$15 million.

22:58.624 --> 23:00.097
Guys, we're doing this.

23:00.597 --> 23:02.399
$15 million.

23:02.499 --> 23:06.413
- Yes. Come on, it'll be fun.
- Like a nervous breakdown is fun?

23:07.013 --> 23:09.175
Dawn, everyone...

23:09.275 --> 23:11.606
we do this show or we start
laying people off again.

23:11.706 --> 23:14.712
Have you thought about how this
is going to affect the other brands?

23:14.812 --> 23:17.715
Well, Live Alchemy hasn't turned
a profit in two and a half years.

23:17.815 --> 23:19.970
Same with Viva Ceramica, San Tropez,

23:20.070 --> 23:22.893
Neo Regenerative. Neo Regenerative
has never turned a profit.

23:22.993 --> 23:25.790
- Neo Regenetif. It's French.
- Is that how you say it? Shut up.

23:26.790 --> 23:30.654
Here's the deal. We are dead
in the water without this woman.

23:54.948 --> 23:56.403
The almonds.

23:56.503 --> 23:59.457
Leave the almonds on the floor.
I can clean them up after the session.

23:59.557 --> 24:01.792
Would it make you feel better
if you were eating, too?

24:01.892 --> 24:06.764
This eating is not working for me.
The food is distracting from the work.

24:06.964 --> 24:09.600
I have to eat because
of my new relationship with glucose.

24:09.700 --> 24:12.569
All right. You can have
a snack at five of two

24:12.669 --> 24:16.004
and another one at 2:50.
Please stop eating in session.

24:23.280 --> 24:24.478
So...

24:24.578 --> 24:27.830
like Oprah, but with a swan boat.

24:27.930 --> 24:29.862
Talk show.

24:30.454 --> 24:32.092
Hosted by...

24:32.192 --> 24:34.191
Me.

24:34.291 --> 24:37.227
- Hosted by you.
- Yeah.

24:38.566 --> 24:40.164
All right.
Well, how about a little recap?

24:40.264 --> 24:43.587
In case you missed last week's episode
of the Alice Klieg Show...

24:43.687 --> 24:45.402
That's not what it's called.

24:45.802 --> 24:48.038
That's not the name of it.

24:48.638 --> 24:52.810
You're off your meds,
you just spent $15 million,

24:52.910 --> 24:56.911
you're living in a reservation casino,
and you're hosting your own talk show.

25:00.782 --> 25:03.220
I thought I asked you not to eat.

25:03.320 --> 25:04.485
It's a banana.

25:06.555 --> 25:08.823
It's in its own container.

25:09.959 --> 25:12.760
I come out... on the swan boat.

25:27.176 --> 25:29.677
And then I talk about myself.

25:31.948 --> 25:36.486
Is there a show that's kind of like
what you want your show to be?

25:36.986 --> 25:38.489
Oprah.

25:38.589 --> 25:41.224
So, maybe we should watch
some old Oprahs

25:41.324 --> 25:44.628
and pay special attention
to how each show has a topic.

25:44.728 --> 25:46.001
I have a topic.

25:46.101 --> 25:48.291
- Which is?
- Me.

25:49.599 --> 25:52.870
- What does that mean?
- You know, just what I love.

25:52.970 --> 25:55.439
My hopes, my dreams. What I like to eat.

25:55.539 --> 25:59.397
Who I think is a cunt. My spirituality.

26:00.442 --> 26:01.432
Me.

26:02.679 --> 26:05.385
We need to figure out
how to break this down into segments.

26:05.515 --> 26:08.085
- This is going be live.
- Yeah, okay.

26:08.185 --> 26:13.356
Well... we have regulating your moods
with a high protein lifestyle.

26:14.824 --> 26:18.528
- I want to do a reenactment.
- About what?

26:18.628 --> 26:20.831
- Jordana.
- Jordana who?

26:21.452 --> 26:24.799
- Jordana Spangler.
- Who is Jordana Spangler?

26:30.272 --> 26:31.306
A liar.

26:38.647 --> 26:40.981
Donna Keever.

26:42.952 --> 26:45.021
We'll be right with you.

26:45.121 --> 26:47.667
Alice's. For the reenactments.

26:47.767 --> 26:52.292
- Oh, right. Where is she?
- In the booth, recording her theme song.

27:00.636 --> 27:03.073
You should hear these segment ideas.

27:03.173 --> 27:05.809
- "Matching Colors to Emotions."
- Okay. What else?

27:05.909 --> 27:08.211
"To Be a Woman." That one's a song.

27:08.311 --> 27:10.781
Something called
"I Can Still Smell You."

27:10.881 --> 27:13.483
"Lucky Foods", "You Got Everything,
I Got Nothing."

27:13.583 --> 27:17.220
Can we please... talk about this?

27:17.320 --> 27:19.956
Talk about what?

27:20.056 --> 27:22.859
I don't feel great
about where this is going.

27:22.959 --> 27:26.026
How do you feel
about where this is going?

27:30.166 --> 27:33.644
I'm glad we got to do this.
I got work to do.

27:46.582 --> 27:49.085
Poor sad eyes.

27:49.185 --> 27:50.854
I miss being around dogs.

27:59.328 --> 28:01.198
I'll take Godzilla over here.

28:01.498 --> 28:03.409
Get in.

28:13.642 --> 28:14.888
You want to talk camera?

28:16.212 --> 28:18.815
That's the zoom. That's the focus.

28:19.015 --> 28:21.166
Here's the pan.

28:22.351 --> 28:25.397
Yeah? And the tilt.

28:29.491 --> 28:33.162
And up here's the tally light.
When that's on, you know it's recording.

28:33.262 --> 28:37.066
- Do you want to have dinner?
- I can't.

28:37.166 --> 28:39.681
Can it be a work dinner?

28:39.781 --> 28:42.340
Can it not be a work dinner?

28:48.244 --> 28:51.312
It's just a restraining order.
It's not a big deal.

28:52.181 --> 28:54.918
- Sounds like cops.
- It's real.

28:55.018 --> 28:58.802
I can't go within 50 feet of her.
Or Souplantation.

29:02.391 --> 29:04.861
I've been divorced twice.

29:04.961 --> 29:07.030
Really?

29:07.630 --> 29:09.499
Yeah.

29:09.599 --> 29:11.366
Not twice. I mean three times.

29:12.835 --> 29:15.769
I... I love too much.

29:19.470 --> 29:20.675
It's not a good thing.

29:23.111 --> 29:25.490
I have a swing over my bed.

29:26.448 --> 29:28.551
I mean, I...

29:28.651 --> 29:32.556
I used to... It's in the garage now.

29:32.656 --> 29:34.755
Can I make an observation?

29:35.958 --> 29:37.194
Sure.

29:37.294 --> 29:39.443
I want you to fuck me so bad.

29:47.636 --> 29:49.620
Hang over.

30:00.616 --> 30:02.503
Hey.

30:13.495 --> 30:15.162
I'm going in there, you guys.

30:19.435 --> 30:21.271
Alice?

30:21.371 --> 30:23.240
We need you in hair and makeup.

30:23.340 --> 30:25.878
We're all very proud of you.

30:28.010 --> 30:29.146
Me, too.

30:30.452 --> 30:32.882
You are ready.

30:32.982 --> 30:35.151
You are beautiful.

30:35.251 --> 30:37.321
You are great.

30:37.421 --> 30:40.918
- You are nice.
- In front of the... lips.

30:42.958 --> 30:45.025
You are edible.

30:52.167 --> 30:55.409
This is the best
I can do for you, honey.

30:57.373 --> 31:00.910
- You should go now, Alice.
- Good luck.

31:01.010 --> 31:04.103
- It's not about luck.
- Okay.

31:06.782 --> 31:10.351
Thirty seconds to air.
Camera two to your mark.

31:12.988 --> 31:16.660
Does anyone know where she is?
We need her in the bird.

31:16.760 --> 31:19.763
- We need to get you in the bird.
- <i>Okay, Grace has got her.</i>

31:19.863 --> 31:22.051
<i>An Aeroknife,
no force or strength or pressure.</i>

31:22.151 --> 31:24.801
She's doing the best she can.

31:24.901 --> 31:26.836
Do you have any questions?

31:26.936 --> 31:31.105
Yeah, when people see me on TV, is my face
switched around or on the right side?

31:33.075 --> 31:34.778
- You're going to look great.
- Thanks.

31:34.878 --> 31:36.851
Have fun.

31:44.086 --> 31:48.158
We go live in five, four, three.

31:48.258 --> 31:51.825
Everybody, she is on her way.

32:03.873 --> 32:07.187
<i>From Palm Desert, California,
New Vibrance Studios,</i>

32:07.287 --> 32:12.679
<i>it's Welcome To Me,
with your host, Alice Klieg.</i>

32:32.168 --> 32:34.151
She's doing a lot with her hands.

32:48.650 --> 32:52.052
- What is she doing?
- I think she's a little frozen.

32:57.593 --> 33:01.596
- Come on.
- Say something, Alice. Say something.

33:07.069 --> 33:09.409
You're on TV now.

33:12.141 --> 33:15.342
Hello. I'm Alice Klieg,
and Welcome To Me.

33:19.647 --> 33:21.716
And so it begins.

33:23.485 --> 33:26.420
Lose it. Twenty to the insert.

33:30.759 --> 33:32.996
This morning I woke up and there was
a pubic hair on my pillow

33:33.096 --> 33:34.632
shaped like a question mark.

33:35.336 --> 33:38.335
<i>And it really got me thinking
of unanswered questions.</i>

33:38.535 --> 33:41.288
Like all the times in my life when I was
supposed to feel something,

33:41.488 --> 33:43.240
but I felt nothing.

33:43.340 --> 33:44.790
And all the other times in my life

33:44.890 --> 33:48.207
where I wasn't supposed to feel anything,
but I felt too much,

33:48.307 --> 33:51.481
and the people around me weren't
really ready for all of my feelings.

33:51.881 --> 33:54.250
How many episodes did she buy?

33:54.350 --> 33:56.219
To me, it's worse than heroin.

33:56.319 --> 33:59.722
Worse than any childhood
sexual abuse. You name it.

33:59.822 --> 34:01.891
It wasn't until
I got off the sugar wheel

34:01.991 --> 34:04.694
that I really took control
of my life for the first time.

34:04.794 --> 34:06.163
Then I went off my meds.

34:06.963 --> 34:08.965
<i>Grape tomatoes. They're low glycemic...</i>

34:09.065 --> 34:11.293
Did you know that?

34:12.735 --> 34:16.639
Ladies and gentlemen, meatloaf cake
with mashed sweet potato icing.

34:16.938 --> 34:20.743
With only 433 calories,
52 grams of protein,

34:20.842 --> 34:25.748
and only five carbohydrants.
I think I'm going to have a slice.

34:26.148 --> 34:28.551
Is it carbohydrates or carbohydrants?

34:28.650 --> 34:30.685
It's carbohydrates.

34:49.971 --> 34:52.976
- What's the next piece?
- No, we're on this for a while.

34:53.376 --> 34:55.712
Can Frank tell her to move it along?

34:55.812 --> 34:58.782
No, this is what she wanted.
She wanted to...

34:58.882 --> 35:00.245
She wanted to sit and eat
the cake for an hour?

35:00.345 --> 35:04.518
Yes. Not an hour.
I think it's a good five minutes, though.

35:14.496 --> 35:16.997
So good.

35:20.669 --> 35:22.639
Sometimes I really wonder about people.

35:23.139 --> 35:26.576
Whether they stop maturing emotionally
because of a traumatic event,

35:26.676 --> 35:28.111
maybe a birth defect.

35:28.811 --> 35:32.706
We may never know what twisted the soul
of the daughter of a California dentist,

35:32.806 --> 35:35.485
and to the cruel and malicious
betrayer she became.

35:36.185 --> 35:38.054
<i>Come with me.
I want to show you something.</i>

35:38.154 --> 35:40.588
<i>I'm going to ride my bike.
Come, tag along.</i>

35:44.926 --> 35:47.530
Your sandwich has Cheddar cheese,

35:47.630 --> 35:49.999
also lettuce and some mayonnaise.

35:50.099 --> 35:52.935
Good, good. That's what I want.

35:53.035 --> 35:56.906
Now, in the manner of girls,
let's share some secrets. You start.

35:57.606 --> 36:00.410
What a relief.
Now I can let my hair down.

36:00.510 --> 36:03.179
And by hair I mean defense mechanisms.

36:03.279 --> 36:07.250
And now that you feel safe,
you can tell me anything.

36:07.350 --> 36:10.394
When I was 19, I went to live
with a minister and his family

36:10.494 --> 36:11.751
as an exchange student.

36:11.854 --> 36:13.548
One day we went to the zoo

36:13.648 --> 36:17.156
and I saw a swan choke on a pretzel bite
before my very eyes.

36:17.256 --> 36:19.162
You told everyone at school
I was borderline.

36:19.262 --> 36:21.398
And when I asked you,
you denied telling anyone.

36:21.498 --> 36:24.667
But every single person that I talked to
told me that you said I was.

36:25.367 --> 36:29.236
Everything was different after that.
And it really hurt me.

36:57.432 --> 36:59.700
<i>Fuck you to death, Jordana.</i>

37:04.005 --> 37:06.283
Why did it end like that?

37:06.875 --> 37:09.112
We have a few bumps to iron out.

37:09.812 --> 37:11.414
Why does it look so inexpensive?

37:12.014 --> 37:14.651
Well, Alice, we got you
up and running pretty quickly,

37:14.751 --> 37:17.581
- so we're still trying to...
- And why doesn't it look like Oprah?

37:17.681 --> 37:21.057
Because you ate a cake
made out of hamburger and started crying.

37:22.057 --> 37:24.427
Oprah had the highest production
values in the business.

37:24.527 --> 37:27.310
She had the best graphics,
the best lighting, sets, sound.

37:27.410 --> 37:29.481
She had everything.

37:29.581 --> 37:31.732
I'd like that.

37:34.136 --> 37:36.039
This is all doable.

37:36.139 --> 37:38.607
Oh, I want a new opening,

37:38.707 --> 37:41.110
and a new Alice.

37:41.210 --> 37:44.413
And I'd like more swans, too.
I can bring those from home.

37:45.568 --> 37:49.319
Yeah. I want to talk to people.
You know, like Larry King.

37:50.219 --> 37:52.820
- What was wrong with the girl who played you?
- She just wasn't me.

37:55.957 --> 37:58.291
Can someone give me a lift?

37:58.894 --> 38:00.555
Sure.

38:08.236 --> 38:10.507
I don't even know
where to begin. Really.

38:10.907 --> 38:13.242
Why don't we try to get the swans?

38:13.342 --> 38:15.511
She has them at home.
She said she's bringing...

38:15.611 --> 38:18.379
I'm not buying one fucking swan.

38:22.185 --> 38:24.187
You left the TV on.

38:24.287 --> 38:26.753
It's been on for 11 years.

38:30.258 --> 38:32.993
I should have them
take you to the studio.

38:34.830 --> 38:38.933
Thanks for driving me. This is my old house
from when I was a different person.

38:50.078 --> 38:54.881
I see you... got everything by color.

38:55.684 --> 38:57.888
Colors help me keep
my emotions separate.

38:59.088 --> 39:01.522
Yeah, I can never keep
my emotions separate.

39:15.804 --> 39:18.338
Have you ever done it in a bag?

39:19.474 --> 39:21.308
No.

39:25.247 --> 39:28.482
- Shall I take this off?
- No, no.

39:34.890 --> 39:36.795
<i>If you're embarrassed about your feet,</i>

39:36.895 --> 39:41.130
<i>tired of tearing pantyhose,
or sick of messy scrapers that hurt,</i>

39:41.230 --> 39:45.665
<i>then you need Ped Egg,
the number one selling ultimate way...</i>

40:09.858 --> 40:14.102
Good morning. My name is Alice Klieg,
and Welcome To Me.

40:15.263 --> 40:19.068
<i>Live from New Vibrance Studios
in Palm Desert, California,</i>

40:19.168 --> 40:21.370
<i>it's Welcome To Me.</i>

40:21.470 --> 40:23.871
<i>With your host, Alice Klieg.</i>

40:26.775 --> 40:28.978
That corn is pretty.

40:29.078 --> 40:31.612
Let's get ready to track and dissolve.

40:40.788 --> 40:43.192
Water. Thank you, baby.

40:43.292 --> 40:45.826
<i>No problem, baby.
It's all working for you.</i>

40:48.563 --> 40:51.931
<i>And rotate set.</i>

40:58.139 --> 41:01.608
Come with me. Enjoy another time
that happened to me.

41:15.590 --> 41:17.391
<i>Big Bear, 1991.</i>

41:22.297 --> 41:24.000
<i>Thief!</i>

41:24.400 --> 41:26.781
<i>Keep going.</i>

41:28.536 --> 41:31.445
<i>Buy your own makeup, Josie Gaston.</i>

41:31.545 --> 41:32.573
Yes.

41:35.176 --> 41:38.444
Oh, my gosh.

41:40.215 --> 41:43.052
Someone's been tampering
with my makeup bag.

41:43.152 --> 41:46.422
Really loud. You have to yell. Yell it.

41:46.522 --> 41:48.075
Someone!

41:50.760 --> 41:54.763
Someone's been tampering
with my makeup bag!

41:55.406 --> 41:59.101
- How in this world.
- How in this world!

41:59.201 --> 42:04.373
Someone's been tampering
with my makeup... bag!

42:05.073 --> 42:06.149
She's got problems.

42:06.249 --> 42:09.412
<i>I know, it's very upsetting.
I was very upset.</i>

42:10.352 --> 42:13.679
I cried for so many days.

42:20.322 --> 42:22.125
<i>You said Bill looked like a drug addict</i>

42:22.225 --> 42:25.261
<i>and that he had no business
working around people.</i>

42:25.361 --> 42:29.198
- Her Mom is kicking her ass.
- But she's not paying attention, clearly.

42:29.898 --> 42:32.899
<i>You remember what you want to remember.</i>

42:35.171 --> 42:36.940
Now we're all paying attention.

42:37.119 --> 42:40.743
<i>Grape tomatoes. They're low glycemic
and full of phytonutrients.</i>

42:40.843 --> 42:42.845
- <i>Alice?</i>
- Yes, hi. Thanks for calling.

42:43.245 --> 42:45.381
- I think you're a genius.
- <i>You do?</i>

42:45.481 --> 42:48.717
Yeah. I attended
your last show, actually.

42:48.917 --> 42:52.152
Godzilla, come here, come here.
Godzilla, come here.

42:56.390 --> 42:59.528
- That's for menopause.
- I like it.

42:59.628 --> 43:01.797
Why don't you get a titty-kini?

43:01.897 --> 43:04.099
I look horrible in those.

43:04.199 --> 43:05.902
What do you mean
you're not a bikini type?

43:06.202 --> 43:10.673
You know. Bikini types. One piece types.

43:10.773 --> 43:12.642
You got it all wrong, Gina.

43:12.742 --> 43:15.878
If you want to wear a two-piece,
the decision lies with you.

43:15.978 --> 43:18.814
And nobody has the right
to tell you otherwise.

43:19.214 --> 43:21.650
Come on, love yourself.

43:22.250 --> 43:24.274
I sure do.

43:25.621 --> 43:28.176
This is the one I chose.

43:39.767 --> 43:41.537
Nothing. Nothing.

43:41.637 --> 43:45.674
There are two times in my life I've performed
oral sex on a man twice my age.

43:45.774 --> 43:47.655
Jesus.

43:49.344 --> 43:51.981
<i>And that's when I found out
you were a hermaphrodite.</i>

43:52.081 --> 43:55.353
<i>You're a liar, Jordana Spangler.</i>

43:55.651 --> 43:58.220
- <i>You're on TV.
- I don't want to be on TV.</i>

43:58.320 --> 44:00.389
Everybody wants to be on TV.

44:00.489 --> 44:05.191
<i>Not everyone
is an emotional exhibitionist.</i>

44:13.668 --> 44:16.772
<i>Good morning. My name is Alice Klieg,
and Welcome To Me.</i>

44:16.872 --> 44:19.175
<i>Welcome To Me.
Welcome To Me. Me, me, me.</i>

44:19.475 --> 44:21.097
And Welcome To Me.

44:26.315 --> 44:28.818
<i>I knew if I bit him again,
he would beat me.</i>

44:29.958 --> 44:32.955
And I don't mean, like,
on Thanksgiving, you know,

44:33.055 --> 44:36.539
like a sexy beating.
I mean like a real beating.

44:38.227 --> 44:41.297
He would say, "That's just how we do things
in Gaithersburg, Maryland."

44:41.397 --> 44:44.630
<i>Like he was Mr. Big Man,
and he really wasn't.</i>

44:46.868 --> 44:51.870
I was a superior wrestler, even though
I didn't have the training he did.

45:19.300 --> 45:21.570
I should let you know

45:21.670 --> 45:24.876
that I tried to have you put
on psychiatric hold last week.

45:25.376 --> 45:26.409
And what is that?

45:26.509 --> 45:30.410
It means having you involuntarily
committed for an observation period.

45:35.776 --> 45:38.253
- Well, thank you.
- You're welcome.

45:38.353 --> 45:41.357
I'm very worried about you.

45:41.457 --> 45:44.660
I feel like you are
a danger to yourself.

45:45.160 --> 45:47.294
Maybe I'm not what you think I am.

45:51.032 --> 45:53.869
I'm going to read a list of symptoms

45:53.969 --> 45:56.806
common to people getting off of Abilify.

45:56.906 --> 45:59.575
Tell me if you are experiencing
any of this, okay?

45:59.675 --> 46:02.565
Do you have anything to say

46:02.665 --> 46:05.581
before you are sentenced?

46:05.681 --> 46:08.551
I am innocent.

46:08.751 --> 46:12.788
But your wantonness and perversion

46:13.188 --> 46:16.859
have threatened the sanctity of Canada.

46:16.959 --> 46:20.913
But I never asked for these or this.

46:21.413 --> 46:26.168
Alice Klieg, you are found guilty.

46:26.268 --> 46:28.471
Guilty, guilty.

46:28.571 --> 46:30.737
No.

46:32.640 --> 46:34.412
<i>Mama.</i>

46:34.512 --> 46:39.779
<i>It's so dark. Mama. I can see
the pommel horse, mama.</i>

46:42.650 --> 46:45.053
Yeah, yeah, I got Alice.

46:45.153 --> 46:47.248
Yeah, copy that.

46:49.924 --> 46:51.925
Miss Klieg.

46:53.661 --> 46:56.632
- Who are you?
- Hi. I'm Rainer.

46:56.832 --> 46:59.719
- I actually called during your last show.
- I remember.

46:59.819 --> 47:04.340
Yeah. I just want to say I thought
this was, like, your best show yet.

47:04.440 --> 47:07.710
- Really?
- Yeah, you should do five shows a week.

47:08.010 --> 47:10.613
- I hate waiting.
- Like Oprah.

47:10.713 --> 47:12.715
Yeah, I don't know.
I'm writing this paper about you,

47:12.815 --> 47:14.917
about your invention
of the narrative infomercial,

47:15.017 --> 47:18.587
and I was wondering if maybe
you would want to be interviewed.

47:18.687 --> 47:21.764
- Okay.
- Yeah?

47:23.691 --> 47:26.256
Same stuff here.

47:32.633 --> 47:34.070
- Hey, Alice.
- <i>Guess what.</i>

47:34.170 --> 47:37.562
<i>They picked up my show
for five days a week.</i>

47:37.662 --> 47:38.656
Wow, that's great.

47:38.756 --> 47:41.810
And I'm recording my song
with a European orchestra,

47:41.910 --> 47:44.246
and they're studying me in school.

47:44.546 --> 47:47.850
<i>This grad student came to my show.
He was wearing a tuxedo.</i>

47:47.950 --> 47:51.186
That's... so great, Alice.

47:51.286 --> 47:52.688
It just, you know, for the record,

47:52.788 --> 47:56.492
I just want to say that I don't...
I don't like bikinis.

47:56.592 --> 47:59.661
<i>It's not that I think that I'm fat
or anything. I just I don't...</i>

47:59.761 --> 48:01.964
- They're ready to start.
- You know what? I got to go.

48:02.064 --> 48:03.899
- Sorry, I'm at work.
- <i>Okay.</i>

48:09.573 --> 48:12.274
Cindy Sherman.

48:12.374 --> 48:14.843
Yeah, from Laverne and Shirley?

48:15.443 --> 48:18.162
No, no. She's a photographer.

48:19.982 --> 48:21.401
Man, the fact that you don't know
who she is,

48:21.501 --> 48:25.754
makes you, like, 75 million times
more radical than you already are.

48:25.854 --> 48:28.590
- Do you mind if I...
- No. Not at all.

48:28.990 --> 48:30.759
I love your facial expressions.

48:31.359 --> 48:33.032
Well, thank you.

48:33.132 --> 48:35.664
I've never been interviewed before.

48:35.764 --> 48:39.265
- Well, yeah, cheers.
- Congratulations.

48:43.871 --> 48:46.541
- Oh, is it not good?
- I don't drink.

48:46.641 --> 48:49.215
Cool. So, I'm interviewing you

48:49.315 --> 48:52.014
for this class that I'm in right now
called Memoir in Performance,

48:52.114 --> 48:54.548
- and when I saw your reenactments...
- I love you.

48:58.919 --> 49:01.524
I love the way that you play with gender

49:01.624 --> 49:05.728
and race and time
and perception in your work.

49:05.828 --> 49:09.031
I'm just wondering, what's behind
the color-blind casting for you?

49:09.331 --> 49:12.434
Oh, you mean the skier in "Someone's
been tampering with my makeup bag?"

49:12.534 --> 49:16.004
- Yeah.
- She was the prettiest that day.

49:16.104 --> 49:18.912
I was prettier back then.

49:19.641 --> 49:22.211
Do you think I'm pretty now?

49:22.611 --> 49:25.505
<i>- That's what you said.
- I said...</i>

49:27.282 --> 49:29.918
It's got 170,000 hits already.

49:30.018 --> 49:34.056
- How did you know I was on here?
- I'm monitoring your web presence.

49:35.108 --> 49:39.191
You've got some copycats, too.
But they're not you.

49:43.631 --> 49:46.168
I don't feel so good.

49:47.068 --> 49:48.804
You're not supposed to swallow it.

49:49.505 --> 49:52.071
Am I supposed to swallow you?

49:54.809 --> 49:56.642
Alice.

49:57.492 --> 49:59.519
Oh, my God.

50:27.374 --> 50:29.011
<i>Birth.</i>

50:29.111 --> 50:30.846
<i>Purpose.</i>

50:30.946 --> 50:32.481
<i>Destiny.</i>

50:42.858 --> 50:45.561
<i>showing, and growing.</i>

50:45.961 --> 50:48.747
<i>Thank you for choosing Welcome To Me.</i>

50:48.847 --> 50:53.366
<i>Fasten your safety belts
and prepare for take-off.</i>

50:54.235 --> 50:58.037
<i>And now, your host, Alice Klieg.</i>

51:13.754 --> 51:16.192
<i>Alice? Are you still there?</i>

51:16.292 --> 51:21.297
- Yeah, I'm here.
- <i>I hear... noises in the background there.</i>

51:21.997 --> 51:24.566
- Oh, I'm at the airport.
- <i>Where are you flying to?</i>

51:24.666 --> 51:27.669
Oh, I'm not. I just...
I had to mail something.

51:27.769 --> 51:29.405
<i>Okay.</i>

51:29.505 --> 51:32.674
<i>So, are you planning on seeing...</i>

51:32.774 --> 51:35.144
- <i>his name...</i>
- Rainer?

51:35.244 --> 51:37.811
<i>Are you s... Are you planning
on seeing Rainer again?</i>

51:40.915 --> 51:42.323
<i>Hello?</i>

51:46.754 --> 51:49.079
- I want you to know I'm not mad at you anymore.
- <i>About what?</i>

51:49.179 --> 51:51.893
Remember the other day
when you yelled at me?

51:51.993 --> 51:55.898
<i>Alice, please reconsider
getting back on your regimen.</i>

51:55.998 --> 51:59.735
<i>If it's a dosage thing,
we can figure it out, make adjustments.</i>

51:59.835 --> 52:02.368
<i>Okay, our time is up.</i>

52:10.277 --> 52:13.148
We've got red kidney beans, ground beef,

52:13.248 --> 52:15.984
low sugar tomato sauce,
herbs and spices,

52:16.084 --> 52:20.055
bringing us in at only nine grams
of carbohydrants per serving.

52:20.155 --> 52:22.121
Now, that's a low glycemic meal.

52:28.364 --> 52:32.268
- <i>Dawn? Frank? Can you see this?</i>
- Not really, Alice.

52:32.368 --> 52:36.038
Why don't you bring it on down
so the audience can take a look?

52:36.538 --> 52:39.772
- Good idea, baby.
- <i>No problem, baby.</i>

52:42.618 --> 52:44.871
Oh, my God, I'm burning.

52:44.971 --> 52:47.949
- Oh, my God. I'm burning.
- Grace, go help her get that off.

52:48.532 --> 52:51.053
Oh, my... Get away from me.

52:51.153 --> 52:54.741
How did this happen? Help me!

52:58.553 --> 53:02.996
Whose job is this? Help me! Gabe!

53:04.765 --> 53:08.437
- You should try Gabe again.
- I'll try him in a little bit.

53:08.537 --> 53:12.541
- Did you tell him I'm in the burn unit?
- Yeah, I already did.

53:13.141 --> 53:15.110
Will it be a lot of damage?

53:15.210 --> 53:18.016
Only second-degree burns.

53:18.747 --> 53:20.546
Why did this happen to me?

53:23.417 --> 53:25.806
Lady Gym is closing.

53:28.956 --> 53:30.957
Do you think I should sue the station?

53:33.260 --> 53:35.664
I lost my job.

53:36.161 --> 53:38.500
You'll find one.

53:39.340 --> 53:41.200
I can't feel my tits.

53:45.072 --> 53:46.975
Oh, don't go. Please.

53:47.075 --> 53:49.945
I got to get a few hours sleep
or I'll be useless tomorrow.

53:50.045 --> 53:51.913
I have four interviews lined up.

53:52.613 --> 53:54.080
Okay.

54:03.924 --> 54:07.994
Can someone please
turn my fucking TV on?

54:24.145 --> 54:27.515
- You didn't answer the front door.
- That's right, I didn't.

54:27.815 --> 54:29.551
I saw the show.

54:30.289 --> 54:32.020
Which one?

54:32.120 --> 54:34.220
The one that I was on.

54:36.557 --> 54:38.624
- I should've let you know.
- Yes, you should have.

54:41.362 --> 54:43.420
Where are you going?

54:43.866 --> 54:47.202
These are all well respected doctors,
a couple of whom I know personally.

54:47.302 --> 54:49.204
They'd be happy to consider
taking you on as a patient.

54:49.304 --> 54:51.239
- You're firing me?
- I'm not firing you.

54:51.339 --> 54:54.640
I'm seeing to my own safety.
You should try it.

54:56.310 --> 54:58.093
Daryl?

55:00.314 --> 55:01.959
Daryl?

55:02.759 --> 55:04.927
Come back.

55:11.592 --> 55:16.095
No, I'm just eating a cheese sandwich.

55:17.131 --> 55:19.178
Alice.

55:20.134 --> 55:22.003
There she is.

55:22.103 --> 55:23.639
- Welcome back.
- Thanks.

55:23.739 --> 55:26.641
I've got something
that might cheer you up.

55:26.741 --> 55:28.710
Turn to page 31.

55:28.810 --> 55:32.180
Not only did somebody make the ratings,

55:32.280 --> 55:34.313
somebody beat
the Fresh Prince of Bel Air.

55:36.917 --> 55:39.888
And I just got a call
from KPXN San Bernardino.

55:39.988 --> 55:41.323
They want you for a time-buy.

55:41.823 --> 55:44.125
Congrats, Alice.

55:44.725 --> 55:46.620
Thanks.

55:47.329 --> 55:49.364
So, what's on for Monday?

55:49.764 --> 55:51.397
I want to neuter a dog.

55:54.458 --> 55:55.668
On TV?

55:59.874 --> 56:02.243
- Deb's walking.
- Walking?

56:02.343 --> 56:04.212
Quitting.

56:04.658 --> 56:06.079
No, no, no, no.

56:09.350 --> 56:11.417
Deborah.

56:13.120 --> 56:15.056
She's a menace, Rich.

56:15.156 --> 56:16.858
I can't believe
you're letting her come back.

56:16.958 --> 56:19.461
Oh, wait, yeah. Of course I can.

56:19.561 --> 56:22.195
'Cause you are a greedy twat.

56:28.502 --> 56:30.836
She has a point.

56:33.507 --> 56:36.037
Go have fun with your girlfriend.

56:36.977 --> 56:38.820
I'm done.

56:40.547 --> 56:42.184
Go home. I'll finish up with Alice.

56:42.284 --> 56:45.350
- No, I mean really done.
- Go home, Gabe!

56:49.690 --> 56:52.007
You like being a bully?

56:52.793 --> 56:54.363
You seem a little tense, Gabriel.

56:54.463 --> 56:56.829
Why don't you get married
and divorced again?

57:02.503 --> 57:05.707
- She's rubbing off on you.
- You don't respect me.

57:05.807 --> 57:07.843
You never have.
I want you to buy me out.

57:08.243 --> 57:12.511
- Oh, you're so superior.
- I'll have Barb draw everything up.

57:17.251 --> 57:19.085
Jesus.

57:25.793 --> 57:28.664
<i>I was a veterinary nurse for six years,</i>

57:28.764 --> 57:31.366
<i>and assisted in hundreds
of these "pro-said-ures".</i>

57:32.566 --> 57:35.203
Once again the reckless copulation

57:35.303 --> 57:38.840
of our animal kingdom
leaves us with a "tis-nammi"

57:38.940 --> 57:40.877
of puppies and kitties.

57:41.977 --> 57:45.581
Over the next few weeks,
I plan to neuter my own pets,

57:45.981 --> 57:49.982
<i>and any pets any viewers
would like to bring by the studio.</i>

57:51.351 --> 57:54.198
- It's a public service.
- <i>As you can see,</i>

57:54.298 --> 57:58.760
Godzilla is receiving a mixture
of oxygen and isofluorine gas.

57:58.860 --> 58:01.329
It's really important, as you know,
to remove all the hair

58:01.429 --> 58:04.299
from the penis and walnuts
before we begin.

58:04.399 --> 58:05.842
Let's castrate.

58:09.236 --> 58:10.680
First cut is the deepest.

58:14.550 --> 58:19.579
We're going to want to remove
the walnuts from the other tissue.

58:23.250 --> 58:25.484
Now I'm going to tie it off
with the monofilament.

58:30.291 --> 58:32.974
This is called a subcuticular suture.

58:34.429 --> 58:38.100
And it's going to dissolve in case
the doggie licks the little wound.

58:38.200 --> 58:41.234
<i>If you have a dog that needs
to be neutered, please contact...</i>

58:42.803 --> 58:45.707
- How are you doing, George?
- I'm... need water.

58:46.107 --> 58:48.273
We're doing a good thing.

58:51.445 --> 58:53.646
Doing this all week.

59:34.888 --> 59:36.826
Let's start with the easy stuff.

59:38.326 --> 59:40.893
Here's what Gabe wants.

59:41.896 --> 59:44.232
That's just hurtful. What about Landon?

59:44.332 --> 59:47.402
- He's still on the fence.
- He's crackpot. Never hit him.

59:47.502 --> 59:50.870
Not the point. If he decides
to sue, he will win.

59:53.306 --> 59:56.539
What are you playing at here, Richard?

59:57.278 --> 59:58.711
She wants to be televised.

01:00:01.715 --> 01:00:06.154
She calls this guy "taker,"
said he was a "prostitute of the mind."

01:00:06.354 --> 01:00:08.824
Accused this married mother of three

01:00:08.924 --> 01:00:13.495
of stealing assorted cosmetic
products from her in 1991.

01:00:13.595 --> 01:00:17.332
And the list just goes on and on and on.

01:00:17.632 --> 01:00:19.751
- How much they all want?
- I'm not done.

01:00:19.851 --> 01:00:23.939
The ASPCA is going to be here tomorrow
about what she's doing to those dogs.

01:00:24.039 --> 01:00:26.806
- Okay. Thank you, Barb.
- Richard.

01:00:29.076 --> 01:00:31.477
They're going to shut
your ass down, Richard.

01:00:35.215 --> 01:00:37.385
- What's going on?
- I'll be brief.

01:00:37.485 --> 01:00:40.288
No more neuterings, okay?
All this shit has got to go by tomorrow.

01:00:40.388 --> 01:00:43.332
Take the fucking dogs out of here.
I can't house them anymore.

01:00:43.432 --> 01:00:46.094
I can't do it. All right?
That's just health code stuff.

01:00:47.064 --> 01:00:51.410
Does he know we're live?
Should I say something?

01:00:54.601 --> 01:00:57.438
There are 31 lawsuits
filed against New Vibrance

01:00:57.538 --> 01:00:59.341
from people you slandered on the air.

01:00:59.641 --> 01:01:02.043
So you better get that pretty binder out
and make all these go away

01:01:02.143 --> 01:01:06.548
or a lot of good hard working
non-psychotic people will lose their jobs.

01:01:06.648 --> 01:01:10.418
If you hurt or come close to hurting
someone in my employ again,

01:01:10.518 --> 01:01:14.353
you can find somewhere else to do
this nonsense. No discussion.

01:01:16.423 --> 01:01:20.862
Also, stop screwing my brother.
That's probably best for everybody.

01:01:20.962 --> 01:01:23.431
Have a fantastic show.

01:01:24.699 --> 01:01:26.232
No, this is not the show!

01:01:28.735 --> 01:01:30.002
Okay.

01:02:09.476 --> 01:02:10.979
That's all for today.

01:02:11.779 --> 01:02:14.682
Alice, you have another 40 minutes.

01:02:14.782 --> 01:02:17.118
I'm done for today.

01:02:17.218 --> 01:02:19.054
Can someone please get my dogs?

01:02:19.154 --> 01:02:23.456
Let's get Alice her doggies.
And you heard the lady, that's a wrap.

01:02:29.073 --> 01:02:30.729
Can I go home, too?

01:02:34.234 --> 01:02:36.301
Come on, guys.

01:02:37.403 --> 01:02:39.374
Where's my car?

01:02:39.474 --> 01:02:41.643
- He's coming later.
- Why later?

01:02:41.743 --> 01:02:44.543
- You finished up early today.
- Oh, yeah.

01:02:51.618 --> 01:02:55.057
<i>Hi, this is Gina.
I'm sorry I wasn't able...</i>

01:02:55.490 --> 01:02:58.491
<i>Sorry I wasn't able to pick up the phone.
Please leave me a message.</i>

01:03:01.061 --> 01:03:03.931
I need to cancel my chauffeur today.

01:03:04.841 --> 01:03:07.032
This whole week, actually.

01:03:08.302 --> 01:03:11.570
- Room service.
- Leave it outside!

01:03:17.911 --> 01:03:20.448
<i>This next story is a perfect example
of true friendship.</i>

01:03:20.748 --> 01:03:22.018
Go away!

01:03:22.118 --> 01:03:25.286
<i>Hi, this is Gina. I'm sorry
I wasn't able to come to the phone.</i>

01:03:25.886 --> 01:03:28.690
And I explained this to you guys before,

01:03:28.790 --> 01:03:31.559
and now I have
a thousand packets of protein

01:03:31.659 --> 01:03:35.596
with... 32 grams of carbohydrants,

01:03:35.696 --> 01:03:40.368
and... at 16 grams of straight glucose,

01:03:40.468 --> 01:03:43.269
and I can't, yeah, I can't use that.

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:49.835
<i>I want everybody, everybody in the audience
and all of you at home right now,</i>

01:03:49.935 --> 01:03:53.343
<i>no matter what are you doing,
I want you to take a deep breath.</i>

01:03:53.949 --> 01:03:57.085
<i>In and out. Thank you so much.</i>

01:03:57.185 --> 01:04:00.855
<i>Again. In and out.</i>

01:04:01.355 --> 01:04:03.889
<i>Just relax for the next hour.</i>

01:04:10.631 --> 01:04:13.000
<i>Ms. Klieg, are you still there?</i>

01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:15.381
I'm all alone.

01:04:25.846 --> 01:04:27.972
Please.

01:04:28.649 --> 01:04:31.170
Please. I'm all alone.

01:04:36.190 --> 01:04:38.823
I live in a casino.

01:06:04.410 --> 01:06:06.548
Oh, thank God. Thank God.

01:06:06.648 --> 01:06:10.240
Oh, gosh, you're the only
normal person I've seen.

01:06:19.092 --> 01:06:22.830
Back on the happy pills.
Look out, world.

01:06:22.930 --> 01:06:25.466
When do you get out?

01:06:26.887 --> 01:06:28.267
24 hours.

01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:32.473
I haven't talked to you
since the burn unit.

01:06:32.573 --> 01:06:35.476
I've called you, like, a million times.

01:06:35.576 --> 01:06:37.882
Look, it's better.

01:06:39.379 --> 01:06:41.282
Aren't you happy to see me?

01:06:41.382 --> 01:06:44.085
- Ted has the dogs.
- Oh, my God, I forgot.

01:06:44.385 --> 01:06:48.256
As soon as they let you out, you need
to get them. He can't keep them.

01:06:49.556 --> 01:06:51.681
Wait, you're leaving?

01:06:54.294 --> 01:06:56.658
You're a terrible friend.

01:06:57.198 --> 01:07:00.635
You only care about your own pain.

01:07:00.735 --> 01:07:03.604
I'm sorry you hurt so bad,

01:07:03.904 --> 01:07:08.189
but that doesn't mean other people
aren't vulnerable or sensitive.

01:07:08.459 --> 01:07:10.044
And just because you made
a career out of it

01:07:10.144 --> 01:07:13.048
doesn't mean that other people
don't have feelings.

01:07:13.448 --> 01:07:18.316
You don't get to fucking cry right now.
I am crying right now.

01:07:20.754 --> 01:07:22.690
I lost my job.

01:07:22.790 --> 01:07:26.427
And I told, and you haven't
asked me once if I was okay

01:07:26.527 --> 01:07:29.130
- or if I needed any help.
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:07:29.230 --> 01:07:31.932
I'm sorry. If you want,
I can give you money.

01:07:32.032 --> 01:07:34.586
I don't want money.

01:07:37.304 --> 01:07:39.874
I just want my friend.

01:07:40.374 --> 01:07:43.448
Gina, wait. Gina.

01:07:43.548 --> 01:07:47.279
Fuck you for making me fat
on your stupid show.

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:09.737
What? That's all I have left?

01:08:10.237 --> 01:08:14.041
When you win $86 million,
you don't actually get $86 million.

01:08:14.441 --> 01:08:17.879
So, conservatively speaking,
that's all I have left.

01:08:17.979 --> 01:08:20.515
That's a fortune. It's still a fortune.

01:08:20.615 --> 01:08:24.316
If I were you, I would put this
in a safe place right away.

01:08:27.053 --> 01:08:32.055
- It's in the bank.
- I mean to invest it. I will help you.

01:08:35.228 --> 01:08:37.832
If you make a few smart choices,

01:08:37.932 --> 01:08:41.466
you can have a very comfortable life.

01:08:50.176 --> 01:08:52.645
Did you get our flowers?

01:08:52.746 --> 01:08:56.050
Yes. They were very nice, thank you.

01:08:56.649 --> 01:08:58.419
You feeling better?

01:08:58.519 --> 01:09:01.287
Much. Yeah.

01:09:01.388 --> 01:09:04.947
- Back on my meds.
- Oh, good.

01:09:05.459 --> 01:09:07.694
So, what's on your mind?

01:09:07.795 --> 01:09:12.934
I have six shows left,
but I want to do one long one.

01:09:13.533 --> 01:09:17.102
- Well, we just assumed you were done.
- Almost.

01:09:18.705 --> 01:09:20.138
What did you have in mind?

01:09:21.441 --> 01:09:22.707
Something big.

01:09:27.479 --> 01:09:29.982
Oh, we can do big.

01:09:37.615 --> 01:09:38.725
<i>Alice.</i>

01:09:39.426 --> 01:09:42.093
I know you're mad at me.

01:09:42.662 --> 01:09:46.131
And I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

01:09:47.701 --> 01:09:49.542
<i>I accept your apology.</i>

01:09:51.136 --> 01:09:53.001
Okay.

01:09:57.377 --> 01:09:58.803
<i>I do hope for you, Alice.</i>

01:10:01.381 --> 01:10:02.758
<i>I hope you have a good life.</i>

01:10:04.284 --> 01:10:06.120
Thanks.

01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:08.289
<i>Goodbye, Alice.</i>

01:10:09.675 --> 01:10:11.384
Can I come in?

01:10:20.166 --> 01:10:23.671
Hey, Gina. It's me. I know
I'm not supposed to be calling you,

01:10:23.771 --> 01:10:27.708
but I just wanted you to know
that I'm having one last final show

01:10:27.808 --> 01:10:32.379
and I want... I would be honored
if you were there.

01:10:32.479 --> 01:10:34.402
So...

01:10:34.502 --> 01:10:37.082
please come. Please come.

01:11:10.783 --> 01:11:15.887
Five, four, three, two.

01:11:18.525 --> 01:11:22.094
<i>Live, from beautiful
Palm Desert, California.</i>

01:11:23.697 --> 01:11:26.634
<i>A special encore presentation</i>

01:11:26.734 --> 01:11:30.502
<i>with your host, Alice Klieg.</i>

01:11:35.408 --> 01:11:37.311
Thank you. Thank you.

01:11:38.102 --> 01:11:40.354
Thank you so much.

01:11:41.248 --> 01:11:43.784
Thank you for tuning in
to Welcome to Me,

01:11:43.884 --> 01:11:48.555
"The Legend of a Swan,
A Telethon for Change."

01:11:48.655 --> 01:11:50.522
My name is Alice Klieg.

01:11:57.997 --> 01:12:02.770
Hey, guys. You want
your balls back. I know.

01:12:03.170 --> 01:12:05.973
There are a lot of things
I wish I could change, too.

01:12:07.311 --> 01:12:08.810
I almost burnt my tits off,

01:12:09.210 --> 01:12:13.778
<i>and let a lot of people that I care about
feel like they weren't important to me.</i>

01:12:15.548 --> 01:12:19.120
I hurt a lot of American families,
but I'm learning.

01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:23.254
And tonight, I'm going to make it right.

01:12:24.591 --> 01:12:27.294
Anyone who adopts
any of these loving friends,

01:12:27.394 --> 01:12:29.664
<i>gets a year's worth
of dog food and treats,</i>

01:12:29.864 --> 01:12:33.634
<i>a doggy bed, and a luxury travel crate.</i>

01:12:34.534 --> 01:12:36.277
<i>Do we have the number
on the bottom of the screen, Dawn?</i>

01:12:36.377 --> 01:12:39.471
- Yes, we do, baby.
- <i>Thank you, baby.</i>

01:12:45.244 --> 01:12:46.547
What's going on, Dawn?

01:12:46.947 --> 01:12:50.151
Alice, if I'm not mistaken,

01:12:50.251 --> 01:12:53.053
<i>that's the Carousel of Life.</i>

01:12:54.722 --> 01:12:57.258
- That looks pretty damn good.
- It does.

01:12:57.658 --> 01:12:59.091
Cue the turntable.

01:13:19.779 --> 01:13:22.714
She's off to a really great start.

01:13:24.518 --> 01:13:28.372
- Do we have Gina yet?
- No Gina.

01:13:28.472 --> 01:13:30.224
<i>There are so many things
to be thankful for.</i>

01:13:30.424 --> 01:13:32.626
But right now I would like
to express some gratitude

01:13:32.926 --> 01:13:37.129
towards a certain artistic fellow.
Is Rainer Ybarra in the house?

01:13:48.742 --> 01:13:51.679
<i>I wanted to thank you
for calling me an artist,</i>

01:13:51.779 --> 01:13:55.015
<i>because the moment you did,
so many lost years had meaning.</i>

01:13:55.715 --> 01:13:58.016
Could I just say something?

01:13:58.316 --> 01:14:01.657
- No?
- You need to go back to your seat.

01:14:06.392 --> 01:14:08.160
This is when I pretended to drown.

01:14:22.342 --> 01:14:26.678
- She's going to be just fine.
- She really is.

01:14:29.884 --> 01:14:34.979
And now I would like to honor a genuine
love-maker who I really care about.

01:14:35.079 --> 01:14:38.156
Gabriel Ruskin, would you join me
by the Carousel of Life?

01:14:45.731 --> 01:14:48.302
<i>Once in a blue moon,
life gives you a one-way ticket</i>

01:14:48.602 --> 01:14:51.572
<i>to that deep erotic play land
that only exists inside of us.</i>

01:14:52.472 --> 01:14:55.614
Shining captain on a sea of takers,

01:14:55.714 --> 01:14:58.410
you docked in my port
and it wasn't even raining.

01:15:11.023 --> 01:15:12.893
Go sit down.

01:15:12.993 --> 01:15:16.230
- Still no Gina.
- Should we use a reenactor?

01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:19.355
- Use a reenactor. Use a reenactor.
- Yeah.

01:15:19.455 --> 01:15:24.004
Get Gina reenactor ready
for New Apartment 45 to the roll.

01:15:24.104 --> 01:15:26.941
She's going to be devastated.

01:15:27.041 --> 01:15:28.709
How are we doing in adoptions, Dawn?

01:15:28.809 --> 01:15:34.379
<i>Nothing yet, but the lines are open
and operators are standing by.</i>

01:15:41.654 --> 01:15:42.721
This is for Gina.

01:15:47.093 --> 01:15:51.148
Well, I think your new apartment
is great, Alice.

01:15:51.248 --> 01:15:53.267
I don't know if I can do this.

01:15:53.367 --> 01:15:57.638
Maybe I should go back to the halfway house
where I have been living for most of 1996

01:15:57.738 --> 01:16:00.805
after losing my job
at Palm Desert Animal Control.

01:16:02.508 --> 01:16:05.412
You're ready to have
your own place, Alice.

01:16:05.712 --> 01:16:10.217
I, Gina Selway, just know that you are.

01:16:10.417 --> 01:16:15.055
It's almost as if you believe in me
more than I believe in myself.

01:16:15.155 --> 01:16:17.756
I really do.

01:16:34.607 --> 01:16:36.210
<i>Hey, Grace, Miss Selway has arrived.</i>

01:16:36.310 --> 01:16:39.811
- Oh, my God, Gina's here.
- What!

01:17:27.693 --> 01:17:30.221
I'd like to read
from a prepared statement.

01:17:35.134 --> 01:17:36.837
"Dear Gina,

01:17:36.937 --> 01:17:39.841
"thank you for being the only girl
who would speak to me in the sixth grade.

01:17:40.741 --> 01:17:42.410
"Thank you for letting me sleep
holding on to you

01:17:42.510 --> 01:17:45.193
"during that really bad period in 1989.

01:17:45.612 --> 01:17:48.482
"Without you, I could never
have made it through my 20s,

01:17:48.682 --> 01:17:52.119
"much less become a millionaire
and talk-show host.

01:17:53.019 --> 01:17:55.823
"You are the kindest,
most patient person I know.

01:17:56.323 --> 01:18:00.194
"I don't deserve a friend as loyal as you,
but I sure am lucky to have one.

01:18:00.594 --> 01:18:04.731
"You could have given up on me
seven million times, but you didn't.

01:18:04.831 --> 01:18:09.534
And for all those times, I would like
to present you with the following."

01:19:35.621 --> 01:19:38.525
And we're out in ten,

01:19:38.625 --> 01:19:42.762
nine, eight, seven, six,

01:19:42.862 --> 01:19:44.931
five, four,

01:19:45.031 --> 01:19:48.366
three, two, one.

01:20:17.463 --> 01:20:19.897
You want me to stay?

01:20:21.135 --> 01:20:24.001
You know, I think I'd better bond
with the beast.

01:20:25.971 --> 01:20:28.975
Oh, I got you a present.

01:20:34.847 --> 01:20:37.417
What am I supposed to do with this?

01:20:39.241 --> 01:20:41.780
Anything you want.

01:20:43.888 --> 01:20:45.826
Okay, I'm going to go ahead.

01:20:45.926 --> 01:20:47.995
You go ahead, do your thing.
I'll call you tomorrow.

01:20:48.095 --> 01:20:50.061
Okay.

01:20:59.105 --> 01:21:01.072
Bye.
