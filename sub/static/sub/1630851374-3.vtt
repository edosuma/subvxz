11:20.638 --> 11:22.682
He's-he's ice fishing
with my uncle.

11:22.723 --> 11:24.892
He's ice fishing? He's not home.

Michael, you're gonna borrow
your dad's car.

11:31.732 --> 11:33.234
You're gonna

11:44.328 --> 11:47.039
I used to be like you
when I was a kid.

11:47.081 --> 11:49.750
I was so worried about my
parents getting mad at me

11:49.792 --> 11:51.711
for literally everything.

11:51.752 --> 11:54.797
And then, I went blind,

11:54.839 --> 11:58.384
and I was like,
"What is the point?"

12:00.302 --> 12:02.388
Yeah, but I-I'm not blind,

12:02.430 --> 12:04.557
so that argument
doesn't really apply here.

12:04.598 --> 12:08.519
My point is, it was a relief
to let go of the pressure.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.104

22:34.061 --> 22:35.812
He's innocent!

22:35.854 --> 22:38.899
You left this
at the gas station.

22:38.940 --> 22:41.193
♪ Take on me... ♪

22:41.234 --> 22:43.070
What?

22:43.111 --> 22:45.280
Sorry, I didn't mean
to startle you guys.

22:45.322 --> 22:46.740
She left her ID.

22:46.782 --> 22:48.950
♪ Take on me... ♪

22:48.992 --> 22:50.869
Yep, it's your ID.

22:50.911 --> 22:52.746
Uh, you guys
all right?

22:52.788 --> 22:55.332
Um, oh, we're, uh, we're fine.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.000
Do you want me to
call someone, uh...?

22:57.042 --> 22:58.627
No, please don't call anyone.
An ambulance, police?

22:58.668 --> 23:00.587
Don't call anyone, thank you.
No, thank you.

23:00.629 --> 23:03.298
Uh, you got it.

23:07.511 --> 23:09.221
Why did you tell me to speed up?

23:10.180 --> 23:11.807
I don't know...
I don't know why.

23:11.848 --> 23:14.101
I thought it was someone else.

23:14.142 --> 23:16.395
Michael.

23:18.021 --> 23:20.273
Michael!

23:20.315 --> 23:22.109
Oh, my God.

23:22.150 --> 23:24.069
(coughs)

23:24.111 --> 23:25.612
Oh, my God.

23:25.654 --> 23:27.614
Michael, it's
gonna be okay.

23:27.656 --> 23:29.241
How is it gonna be okay?

23:29.282 --> 23:31.535
My parents are going to kill me!

23:33.036 --> 23:34.955
This is what I get, right?
It's like a, um...

23:34.996 --> 23:37.040
a punishment from
God or something.

23:37.082 --> 23:39.251
It's not a punishment from God.
It just happened.

23:39.292 --> 23:41.711
Y-Yeah, it just-just
happened, thank you.

23:41.753 --> 23:43.964
That's very helpful.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.009
You were just trying
to be a good person.

23:48.051 --> 23:51.012
I was trying to get laid!

23:51.054 --> 23:53.223
And I used
your dead grandma's funeral

23:53.265 --> 23:56.351
as an excuse to smoke weed
and lose my virginity!

23:56.393 --> 23:58.895
Lorri, that's how bad
of a person I am!

23:58.937 --> 24:01.106
(stammers) And-and
the worst part is,

24:01.148 --> 24:03.650
I didn't even get you there.
It didn't even matter.

24:03.692 --> 24:05.610
You just wanted to say goodbye
to your grandma,

24:05.652 --> 24:08.363
and I couldn't even keep
my dad's car on the road!

24:08.405 --> 24:11.032
Michael...
My-my parents are,
they're gonna find out

24:11.074 --> 24:13.034
that I took their Camaro
and they're gonna find out

24:13.076 --> 24:14.494
that I crashed it and
they're gonna find out

24:14.536 --> 24:16.663
that I skipped school
and-and for what?

24:16.705 --> 24:19.249
Literally nothing!
Michael, you need to go home.

24:21.543 --> 24:23.628
You need to go home.

24:25.088 --> 24:28.133
You have no idea what I...

24:29.885 --> 24:33.096
...what I got you into and you,
and you need to go back, okay?

24:33.138 --> 24:34.389
(sniffles)

24:34.431 --> 24:36.683
Just trust me.

24:38.226 --> 24:39.519
I mean,
your parents don't have

24:39.561 --> 24:40.896
to find out
about anything, okay?

24:40.937 --> 24:42.189
We can wipe down the car.

24:43.440 --> 24:45.025
All right?

24:45.066 --> 24:46.776
It will just look
like the car was stolen

24:46.818 --> 24:48.195
while you were at school.
It's like,

24:48.236 --> 24:50.447
it'll be like none
of it ever happened.

24:53.575 --> 24:55.660
No, what are you gonna do?

24:55.702 --> 24:56.912
'Cause there's no way
you're gonna make it

24:56.953 --> 24:58.163
to that funeral on time.

24:59.331 --> 25:00.999
I'll hitchhike.

25:01.041 --> 25:03.335
Hopefully find someone
as nice as you, all right?

25:03.376 --> 25:05.587
I'll be fine.

25:09.591 --> 25:11.468
Okay.

25:17.807 --> 25:19.434
You actually like this stuff?

25:19.476 --> 25:22.020
Eh, you get used to it.

25:22.062 --> 25:23.772
When I get older,
I'm only gonna drink, like, um,

25:23.813 --> 25:26.066
nice cocktails, right?

25:26.107 --> 25:28.527
You've really gotten gayer
as the day has gone on.

25:30.445 --> 25:32.447
The cab's here.

25:32.489 --> 25:34.950
Okay, can you just get me,
uh, situated with my stuff?

25:34.991 --> 25:36.993
Yeah.
Okay, oh.

25:37.035 --> 25:39.162
Thanks.
Okay.

25:40.372 --> 25:42.624
This was fun.
(laughs)

25:42.666 --> 25:45.544
Yeah, it was fun.

25:45.585 --> 25:47.837
Okay, you got it?
Oh, thanks, yeah.

25:47.879 --> 25:49.965
Um, goodbye.

25:50.006 --> 25:52.384
I guess.

25:52.425 --> 25:55.095
Goodbye.

25:59.266 --> 26:01.601
Oh. (chuckles)

26:03.770 --> 26:06.022
Thank you.

26:08.900 --> 26:11.653
Ready to go.

26:11.695 --> 26:13.780
Is she coming?

26:13.822 --> 26:15.907
No, it's just me.

26:41.182 --> 26:42.976
Hey!

26:47.063 --> 26:49.149
(Pretzel whimpering)

26:50.233 --> 26:52.319
I'm sorry, buddy,
I know.

26:54.362 --> 26:57.365
Michael got the munchies,
he ate all our chips.

26:57.407 --> 27:00.577
Okay.
(car approaching)

27:00.619 --> 27:02.037
Hang on.

27:02.078 --> 27:03.622
Excuse me?

27:03.663 --> 27:05.206
Stop!

27:06.499 --> 27:09.586
Oh... oh.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.046
(car door opens)

27:11.087 --> 27:12.422
MICHAEL:
Lorri?

27:12.464 --> 27:14.090
Michael?

27:15.675 --> 27:17.802
What are you doing?
You forget something?

27:17.844 --> 27:21.306
No, I just, um, I-I saw you
from the back window of the cab

27:21.348 --> 27:24.017
and, look, you looked
so sad-- I can't,

27:24.059 --> 27:25.435
I can't leave you here,
okay?

27:25.477 --> 27:27.312
No-- yes, you can, you can.

27:27.354 --> 27:29.397
Call the cab back,
call the cab back!
No, listen, listen!

27:29.439 --> 27:30.815
I'm getting you to Thunder Bay.

27:30.857 --> 27:32.442
I promised you I would,

27:32.484 --> 27:34.027
and I'm-I'm keeping my word.

27:34.069 --> 27:36.196
Okay, I-I need to do this.

27:36.237 --> 27:38.239
That's really
nice of you.

27:38.281 --> 27:39.991
But we don't have enough money
to get a cab the rest of the way

27:40.033 --> 27:41.701
there and I don't want you
calling that pedophile

27:41.743 --> 27:43.662
from your gay app!
No, listen, listen!

27:43.703 --> 27:45.413
We don't have to,
okay, because...

27:46.539 --> 27:48.583
...I called my mom.

27:48.625 --> 27:49.876
Yep.

27:49.918 --> 27:52.087
You called your mom?
Yep.

27:52.128 --> 27:54.631
Michael.
And I told her that I got
into an accident.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.257
No!
And I need her to come
pick me up right away.

27:56.299 --> 27:59.052
No, no, no, Michael.
Listen, listen, okay?

27:59.094 --> 28:01.471
These past few hours with you
have been more exhilarating

28:01.513 --> 28:04.057
than the entirety of my life
up until this point.

28:04.099 --> 28:05.475
And that was because I was,

28:05.517 --> 28:07.894
like, I-I was,
I was actually being me!

28:07.936 --> 28:09.604
Okay, so, you know what?

28:09.646 --> 28:11.189
I-I'm gonna tell
my mom that I'm gay.

28:11.231 --> 28:13.149
And I'm gonna tell her
why I took my dad's car.

28:13.191 --> 28:15.860
And I'm gonna tell her that
I'm so sick of pretending to be

28:15.902 --> 28:17.987
so perfect all the time, okay?

28:18.029 --> 28:20.323
And I'm gonna tell her that she
needs to get you to Thunder Bay.

28:20.365 --> 28:22.742
Michael.

28:22.784 --> 28:24.119
That-that's all great.

28:24.160 --> 28:25.787
But y-you need to...

28:25.829 --> 28:27.163
you need to really think
about this.

28:27.205 --> 28:28.665
Like really think about it.

28:28.707 --> 28:31.042
'Cause I know I told you
you can do whatever

28:31.084 --> 28:32.794
and that, and
that nothing bad

28:32.836 --> 28:34.254
would happen...

28:34.295 --> 28:36.339
Bad things happen, they do.
No, look...

28:36.381 --> 28:38.341
No, trust me, Lorri.
It can't be any worse

28:38.383 --> 28:40.593
than the constant
stress I live under

28:40.635 --> 28:42.512
every day pretending
to be so perfect

28:42.554 --> 28:44.764
all the time-- I'm sick of it!

28:44.806 --> 28:47.225
I'm just sick of it, so,
so you know what?

28:47.267 --> 28:49.144
I-I'm gonna tell her
and I'm afraid

28:49.185 --> 28:51.479
that if I don't do it now,
I never will.

28:57.736 --> 28:59.195
You sure about this?

28:59.237 --> 29:00.905
Yes! Yes, I am.

29:00.947 --> 29:04.033
(stammers) I mean, like,
I had, a whole two minutes

29:04.075 --> 29:06.703
to think about it,
so I-I think I'm good.

29:06.745 --> 29:09.539
I do.

29:09.581 --> 29:11.499
Okay?

29:11.541 --> 29:13.209
Okay.
Okay!

29:13.251 --> 29:14.377
Deal!

29:14.419 --> 29:15.962
Let's do it.

29:16.004 --> 29:17.922
Do you think your mom will
actually drive you, though?

29:17.964 --> 29:19.507
'Cause, I mean, the way
you described her, I'd probably

29:19.549 --> 29:21.176
skip her house
if I was trick or treating.

29:21.217 --> 29:23.136
Yeah, I would, too, but, look.

29:23.178 --> 29:24.929
I-I'm not getting
in that car with her

29:24.971 --> 29:26.556
until she agrees to, okay?

29:26.598 --> 29:28.391
I promise.

29:30.852 --> 29:32.937
Okay.

29:36.816 --> 29:38.026
MURPHY:
Stop it.

29:38.067 --> 29:39.652
Hmm?

29:39.694 --> 29:41.529
You're shaking
the entire swing set.

29:41.571 --> 29:43.448
Oh, sorry.

29:43.490 --> 29:45.283
I'm just, uh,
anxious, sorry.

29:45.325 --> 29:47.243
You should've had
more vodka.

29:47.285 --> 29:49.287
(laughs)

29:49.329 --> 29:51.831
By the way, I-I can't switch
this to Canadian settings.

29:51.873 --> 29:54.542
I think it's a,
uh, carrier issue.

29:54.584 --> 29:56.503
What does that mean?

29:56.544 --> 29:58.963
That unless you get a new SIM
card, it's not gonna work here.

29:59.005 --> 30:01.382
You should do that when
you get to Thunder Bay, okay?

30:05.136 --> 30:06.262
(sighs)

30:06.304 --> 30:07.388
Here she is.

30:07.430 --> 30:09.098
She's here?
Yeah.

30:09.140 --> 30:10.642
All right.
You got this.

30:10.683 --> 30:12.018
Yeah, I got this.

30:12.060 --> 30:13.728
You got this.
Oh, she's gonna freak out

30:13.770 --> 30:14.938
about that car. Oh, man.
You got this.

30:14.979 --> 30:16.022
MARY:
Michael.

30:16.064 --> 30:18.399
Yeah.
What happened?

30:18.441 --> 30:21.277
Well, I, uh...

30:21.319 --> 30:23.321
I-I ran away, and, um...

30:23.363 --> 30:25.532
Well, I lost control
of the car, and then it...

30:25.573 --> 30:26.783
I-I crashed it.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.993
Are you okay?

30:29.035 --> 30:32.121
What?
Oh, my God. I was so scared.

30:32.163 --> 30:35.750
I'm so relieved
you're in one piece.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.337
I love you.

30:39.379 --> 30:41.840
Love you too, Mom.

30:46.094 --> 30:48.054
Who's this woman?

30:48.096 --> 30:50.098
Hi.

30:50.139 --> 30:52.016
Uh, your son was very nice

30:52.058 --> 30:55.979
and, uh, offered me
a ride to Thunder Bay.

30:56.020 --> 30:57.730
Obviously...

30:57.772 --> 31:00.733
little, uh,
fender bender there.

31:00.775 --> 31:02.861
Did she force you into this?

31:04.237 --> 31:06.489
'Cause this whole
thing is just...

31:06.531 --> 31:09.617
It's just so
unlike you.

31:09.659 --> 31:10.994
(clears throat)

31:11.035 --> 31:13.079
MURPHY:
Well, might not

31:13.121 --> 31:15.790
know your son as well
as you think you do.

31:15.832 --> 31:18.585
Michael, tell me what happened
right this instant.

31:25.091 --> 31:27.051
Well, um...

31:27.093 --> 31:30.346
Uh, sh-she did kind of force me.

31:30.388 --> 31:32.140
Like, I just wanted
to go to school,

31:32.181 --> 31:33.850
and she wouldn't
let me, and...

31:33.892 --> 31:35.310
MARY:
Oh, my God.

31:35.351 --> 31:36.686
MICHAEL: It... I mean,
it wasn't too big of a...

31:36.728 --> 31:39.397
Why-why do you smell
like marijuana?

31:40.732 --> 31:43.318
Um...

31:46.279 --> 31:49.657
She smoked a joint in the car.

31:49.699 --> 31:53.369
You kidnapped my son and then
did drugs in front of him?

31:53.411 --> 31:55.413
Yeah, I guess I did.

31:55.455 --> 31:57.624
Sure did.

31:58.541 --> 32:00.710
Okay, that's it.
I'm calling the police.

32:00.752 --> 32:03.046
No, no, no. Mom, Mom, Mom.
Don't call the police.
Yeah, no. No.

32:03.087 --> 32:04.923
You should be arrested, ma'am.
Please. Please, Mom.
Let's just go home.

32:04.964 --> 32:06.507
Come on, please. Please.

32:06.549 --> 32:09.636
MARY:
Fine. Just get in the car.

32:10.929 --> 32:12.847
Now.

32:14.349 --> 32:15.767
(seat belt buckles)
Buckled?

32:15.808 --> 32:17.560
Yeah.
(clears throat)

32:17.602 --> 32:19.562
(engine starts)

32:19.604 --> 32:21.397
I should've
had that woman pay

32:21.439 --> 32:24.525
to have your father's car towed
all the way back to the house.

32:24.567 --> 32:27.028
I hope insurance
covers that, too.
Wait, wait, wait. Mom, Mom, Mom.

32:27.070 --> 32:28.863
Please. Come on.
Uh, I-I have her phone.
What?

32:28.905 --> 32:31.240
So, could you...
could you just l-let me out,

32:31.282 --> 32:32.742
and I can, um...
No. No.

32:32.784 --> 32:35.495
I am not wasting
another minute on that woman.

32:52.971 --> 32:54.931
MURPHY:
Stop!

32:54.973 --> 32:57.016
Please, help me!

33:00.019 --> 33:01.562
Wait!
(vehicle passes)

33:03.856 --> 33:05.817
Stop! Please!

Murphy! Murphy.

Jess?

Yes! Yes.

Jess. Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

35:03.810 --> 35:06.521
Oh, my God.

35:07.438 --> 35:10.149
How did you find me?
I... Well, I...

35:10.191 --> 35:13.277
I put a tracking device in-in
here, in this stuffed animal.

35:13.319 --> 35:15.780
See?
Oh, my God.

35:15.822 --> 35:18.783
Yeah. I always need
to know where you are.

35:18.825 --> 35:21.160
Murphy, what the hell?
What are you doing?

35:21.202 --> 35:23.287
I told you not to leave
the bus station.
I know. I...

35:23.329 --> 35:25.915
I waited for a long time.

35:25.957 --> 35:28.501
I waited for a
really long time.
Yeah.

35:28.543 --> 35:30.002
And you never came.
Where were you?

35:30.044 --> 35:31.212
What happened? I panicked.
I know.

35:31.254 --> 35:33.381
I... It's fine.

35:33.422 --> 35:35.133
I don't want to talk about it.
It's fine. It's fine.

35:35.174 --> 35:36.801
I'm okay.
(exhales)

35:36.843 --> 35:38.219
Yeah.

35:38.261 --> 35:40.638
I was so scared.
I know.

35:40.680 --> 35:43.015
I know. I was scared, too.
(crying):
I was...

35:43.057 --> 35:45.685
Oh, my God.

35:45.726 --> 35:48.521
Oh, my God.
What are you doing here?

35:48.563 --> 35:51.107
(groans)
Well, I was...

35:51.149 --> 35:53.151
I-I thought something bad
happened to you,

35:53.192 --> 35:54.944
so I was trying to get to Felix
before his plane

35:54.986 --> 35:56.821
took off.
Okay, what? Fe...
(chuckles)

35:56.863 --> 35:59.240
Is his plane taking off from...

35:59.282 --> 36:01.159
an abandoned playground?
(chuckles)

36:01.200 --> 36:03.244
No, no. But I-I...

36:03.286 --> 36:04.996
I... My phone wasn't working,
and I...

36:05.037 --> 36:06.747
And I didn't have enough money
for an Uber, and...

36:06.789 --> 36:08.332
So, I met this kid, and he...

36:08.374 --> 36:10.042
I convinced him to drive me
to Thunder Bay,

36:10.084 --> 36:12.170
but he's gay, and he hasn't
come out to his mom yet.

36:12.211 --> 36:14.213
And so then we got
in this accident,

36:14.255 --> 36:15.673
and he called his mom,

36:15.715 --> 36:17.300
and he was gonna tell her,
"I'm gay,"

36:17.341 --> 36:18.759
and then he couldn't do it.

36:18.801 --> 36:20.428
And then the whole plan
fell apart,

36:20.469 --> 36:23.264
and-and I... and I fell asleep.
I fell asleep.

36:23.306 --> 36:25.224
So, you thought
something bad happened to me,

36:25.266 --> 36:27.226
and you fell asleep?

36:27.268 --> 36:29.979
This is a joke.

36:30.021 --> 36:32.148
What?
This is a joke.

36:32.190 --> 36:34.192
Why? What?

36:34.233 --> 36:35.484
What is a joke?

36:35.526 --> 36:37.028
What?

36:37.945 --> 36:39.947
What? What did I do?

36:41.449 --> 36:44.702
You still don't care.

36:44.744 --> 36:47.538
It's unbelievable, really.
Jess.

36:47.580 --> 36:51.000
Jess, I care about you

36:51.042 --> 36:52.418
more than anyone.

36:52.460 --> 36:53.920
No, you don't.
Yes, I do.

36:53.961 --> 36:56.214
No, you don't.

36:57.173 --> 36:59.133
(scoffs)

36:59.175 --> 37:04.096
Look at the insane lengths
that I go for you.

37:05.181 --> 37:08.809
And then you just...
(laughs)

37:08.851 --> 37:11.604
Thank you for putting
a-a-a tracking device

37:11.646 --> 37:14.607
in my stuffed animal?
That's not what
I'm talking about.

37:21.572 --> 37:23.866
I didn't ask you to kill Nia.

37:25.409 --> 37:27.620
You wouldn't have to ask me,
Murphy,

37:27.662 --> 37:29.330
because I would do anything.

37:29.372 --> 37:31.082
I've always, since we were kids,

37:31.123 --> 37:33.584
done everything for you.

37:33.626 --> 37:36.128
And it hurts me...

37:37.630 --> 37:41.259
...so much that you don't feel
the same way.

37:41.300 --> 37:42.927
I do feel the same way, Jess!

37:42.969 --> 37:44.971
I obviously feel the same way.

37:45.012 --> 37:47.556
But I wasn't...
I will never be the same

37:47.598 --> 37:49.517
after what I did. Ever,

37:49.558 --> 37:51.352
Murphy.
I understand, but no one...

37:51.394 --> 37:53.187
It's no one's fault.
I... What was
my other option?

37:53.229 --> 37:54.855
Explain to me, then.
What was my other option?

37:54.897 --> 37:57.942
I don't know. I mean,
you're so bent out of shape.

37:57.984 --> 37:59.443
It sounds like you were...

37:59.485 --> 38:01.153
Should have just left me there
to die,

38:01.195 --> 38:02.905
and you would've been bet...
(grunts)

38:02.947 --> 38:04.740
(groans)

38:04.782 --> 38:06.909
Oh, my God.

38:07.910 --> 38:09.829
Don't ever say that to me again.

38:09.870 --> 38:11.414
(groans)

38:12.373 --> 38:14.875
(exhales)
Ow.

38:14.917 --> 38:16.585
Geez.

38:16.627 --> 38:18.713
Sorry.

38:20.047 --> 38:21.799
I'm sorry. Ow, I'm sorry.

38:21.841 --> 38:24.010
Can we just...

38:24.051 --> 38:25.511
Can we just hang on
for a second?

38:25.553 --> 38:27.847
I mean...

38:27.888 --> 38:30.766
Everything's fine. You found me.

38:30.808 --> 38:32.184
You're here.

38:32.226 --> 38:34.937
I was freaking out,
and you found me.

38:34.979 --> 38:37.148
I'm not here.

38:38.107 --> 38:39.775
What?

38:41.193 --> 38:44.030
Look at me.

38:44.989 --> 38:46.282
Jess.

38:46.324 --> 38:48.868
I'm serious. Just look at me.

38:48.909 --> 38:50.536
I can't.

38:50.578 --> 38:52.079
Just do it.

40:28.008 --> 40:29.844
Wait, wait, wait. Just tell...

40:29.885 --> 40:31.637
Just tell me what he
wants from me, please.

40:31.679 --> 40:33.139
Please, just...

40:33.180 --> 40:34.932
tell me what he wants me...
No! No! No!

40:34.974 --> 40:36.475
No!

40:36.517 --> 40:39.061

Please, let me out!
