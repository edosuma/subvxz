WEBVTT

00:01.080 --> 00:02.080
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.120 --> 00:03.216
I don't think you
should be carrying

00:03.240 --> 00:04.376
this stick around all the time.

00:04.400 --> 00:05.576
Look what happened
when those guys

00:05.600 --> 00:06.896
tried to take
the stick away from you.

00:06.920 --> 00:08.160
It acted defensively.

00:08.240 --> 00:09.241
What are you doing?

00:09.320 --> 00:11.680
It should be with me. I don't
think that's such a good idea.

00:12.840 --> 00:15.810
I can see it. Little pictures
and some strange writing.

00:15.880 --> 00:17.370
Can you draw what you're seeing?

00:17.440 --> 00:18.930
I've never seen
anything like this.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.047
Me, neither.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.281
He's coming after me.

00:21.360 --> 00:23.696
If you don't go back, he's gonna
be coming after both of us.

00:23.720 --> 00:25.449
Bastard got
everything he wanted.

00:25.960 --> 00:27.610
I want Burkhardt found.

01:22.120 --> 01:23.976
We should've killed Renard
when we had the chance.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.161
We never had the chance.

01:25.240 --> 01:26.480
Hey, guys.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.240
Cops were just here.

01:28.320 --> 01:29.321
Well, did they leave?

01:29.440 --> 01:32.011
Not before they checked out the shop.
Like, fully.

01:32.080 --> 01:33.525
What if they come
back and break in?

01:33.600 --> 01:34.816
Nick, you need
to get out of here.

01:34.840 --> 01:35.841
I'm going with you.

01:35.920 --> 01:37.888
What's to stop Renard from
coming after all of us?

01:37.960 --> 01:38.960
Nothing.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.456
Renard will assume
we know where you are.

01:40.480 --> 01:42.360
Well, then I guess it's
good we're out of there.

01:42.400 --> 01:43.496
What do you mean,
"Out of there"?

01:43.520 --> 01:45.456
Renard wants our resignations
first thing in the morning.

01:45.480 --> 01:46.720
He's cleaning house.

01:46.800 --> 01:48.086
Let's go.

01:48.160 --> 01:49.161
Leave Diana's drawing,

01:49.200 --> 01:51.567
we'll keep trying to figure it out.

01:52.080 --> 01:53.127
We should've killed Renard

01:53.200 --> 01:54.964
when we didn't have the chance.

01:58.600 --> 02:00.284
Do not take this ring off

02:00.360 --> 02:03.330
because it would be
extremely painful

02:03.400 --> 02:04.731
for your children.

02:07.160 --> 02:08.286
And how was your day?

02:08.360 --> 02:09.360
Not very good.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.161
That's too bad.

02:12.040 --> 02:13.326
If anything happens to Nick...

02:13.400 --> 02:15.528
Yes, I've heard it all before.

02:16.240 --> 02:17.456
I really think you
should be more worried

02:17.480 --> 02:18.845
about what happens to you.

02:18.920 --> 02:20.570
How are we supposed
to make this work?

02:20.640 --> 02:23.564
I'm not concerned about "we making
this work." It's your problem.

02:25.240 --> 02:27.163
Like it or not,

02:27.240 --> 02:28.730
you are stuck with me.

02:29.720 --> 02:32.724
And you better get with the
program before I take office.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.044
I expect a lot of support

02:37.120 --> 02:39.168
from the First Lady
of this city.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.286
You're doing the right thing.

03:11.560 --> 03:13.289
What is it? Nothing.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.362
That didn't look
like nothing to me.

03:15.440 --> 03:16.965
You felt something.

03:19.720 --> 03:21.131
I didn't wanna put it back.

03:21.600 --> 03:22.601
Why?

03:22.840 --> 03:24.444
I don't know.

03:25.120 --> 03:27.043
It felt like I needed it.

03:27.120 --> 03:28.246
Do you?

03:29.240 --> 03:30.844
Well, it saved my life.

03:30.920 --> 03:32.160
And mine.

03:34.400 --> 03:35.845
You love Adalind.

03:39.480 --> 03:40.686
Why are you asking?

03:40.760 --> 03:42.125
I'm not.

03:42.240 --> 03:43.480
I can feel it.

03:54.320 --> 03:56.402
Got my resignation done. You?

03:56.480 --> 03:58.209
Just printing it up.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.480
What happened to Nick's stuff?

04:00.320 --> 04:02.163
IA confiscated
everything this morning.

04:02.760 --> 04:04.336
What the hell do they
think they're gonna find?

04:04.360 --> 04:06.044
They are wiping the slate clean.

04:06.160 --> 04:07.924
- All right, that'll be all.
- Yes, sir.

04:08.680 --> 04:10.170
Yeah. Okay.

04:12.400 --> 04:14.050
I want you both out
by the end of the day.

04:14.120 --> 04:15.690
No problem.

04:16.720 --> 04:18.370
Here's my resignation.

04:20.560 --> 04:21.560
And yours?

04:21.800 --> 04:22.816
Actually, there's a problem.

04:22.840 --> 04:24.763
Wu... This is not right.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.162
I really don't care
what you think, Sergeant.

04:28.240 --> 04:30.447
I want your resignation,
I want you off the premises.

04:30.520 --> 04:33.967
Or if you'd like,
we can escort you out.

04:42.280 --> 04:43.645
Thank you.

04:45.280 --> 04:46.770
Now, get out.

04:48.720 --> 04:49.801
This is not right.

04:49.880 --> 04:52.645
Wu, back it down. You're
starting to... No, no!

04:52.720 --> 04:55.240
Pull yourself together. This is
not the place you wanna do this.

04:56.120 --> 04:58.122
Wu, stop.

05:02.880 --> 05:04.006
Do you hear me?

05:10.440 --> 05:12.488
Yeah.

05:12.560 --> 05:13.641
Yeah.

05:18.760 --> 05:21.809
Now grab your stuff, and let's
get the hell out of here.

05:28.680 --> 05:29.806
These were the symbols I saw

05:29.880 --> 05:32.087
on the dead guy's face in hell,

05:32.160 --> 05:33.730
or wherever it was he took me.

05:33.800 --> 05:36.280
Everything else
is what Diana saw.

05:36.360 --> 05:38.056
Did the Crusaders make
these marks on the cloth

05:38.080 --> 05:39.920
or were they already there
when they got to it?

05:40.080 --> 05:41.366
I don't know if the cloth

05:41.440 --> 05:43.408
was with the stick
when they found it,

05:43.480 --> 05:45.482
but none of this was visible
with spectral imaging.

05:46.280 --> 05:48.203
How could Diana see it?

05:51.000 --> 05:53.401
You remember what your mother
said to us about Diana?

05:53.880 --> 05:57.248
This child has
an extraordinary destiny.

05:57.320 --> 05:59.209
In the wrong hands,
it could do great evil.

05:59.280 --> 06:01.965
But in the right hands,
it could do great good.

06:02.360 --> 06:03.361
So we're talking, like,

06:03.440 --> 06:06.125
"changing the course of
history" kind of a person.

06:07.360 --> 06:10.842
Diana's power is far greater
than anything Renard has.

06:15.120 --> 06:16.121
Do you hear something?

06:16.280 --> 06:17.281
Someone's coming.

06:17.960 --> 06:19.530
More than one.

06:24.840 --> 06:26.490
Nick, it's me and Wu.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.641
We got some sandwiches, water

06:29.720 --> 06:32.451
and some other stuff
that'll last a long time.

06:32.520 --> 06:33.931
You guys hand in
your resignations?

06:34.000 --> 06:35.081
We did.

06:35.160 --> 06:37.049
We are officially unemployed.

06:37.120 --> 06:39.566
Bet Renard was pretty broken
up to see you guys go.

06:39.640 --> 06:40.640
Oh, yeah.

06:40.680 --> 06:41.920
We're a threat to him.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.656
Well, we better figure out how
we're gonna deal with this,

06:43.680 --> 06:45.921
because I do not plan on living
down here with you guys.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.240
As long as Renard is captain,

06:47.320 --> 06:48.731
he'll only have the precinct.

06:48.800 --> 06:49.926
But when he becomes mayor...

06:50.000 --> 06:51.081
He'll have all of Portland.

06:51.160 --> 06:52.216
There's gotta be
a way to stop him

06:52.240 --> 06:53.401
before he becomes mayor.

06:53.480 --> 06:54.640
Yeah, we'll just convince him

06:54.680 --> 06:55.896
the best thing to do is resign.

06:55.920 --> 06:57.176
Well, that shouldn't
be very hard,

06:57.200 --> 06:58.361
he's a reasonable dickwad.

06:58.480 --> 07:00.130
And what if we don't
have to convince him?

07:00.200 --> 07:02.726
I don't think he'll do it
if we just ask politely.

07:02.800 --> 07:04.245
Or, we don't ask.

07:04.360 --> 07:05.486
We do it.

07:05.560 --> 07:07.927
Same way Eve got all the
information from Rachel.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.490
Well, Eve slept with Rachel.

07:09.560 --> 07:10.971
I was Renard at the time.

07:11.040 --> 07:13.122
Yeah, but who are
you gonna be this time?

07:13.200 --> 07:15.362
Rachel's dead, and we can't
have two Renards out there.

07:15.440 --> 07:16.441
And why not?

07:16.520 --> 07:19.364
Nick, really, one Renard out
there is more than enough.

07:19.440 --> 07:22.091
Well, not if one of
them is one of us.

07:23.240 --> 07:24.280
Do you still have the hat?

07:24.520 --> 07:26.010
Yeah, I have it,
but I don't know

07:26.080 --> 07:27.605
if I can go through that again.

07:27.680 --> 07:29.762
No, not you, me.

07:29.840 --> 07:31.888
You want me to
turn you into Renard?

07:31.960 --> 07:34.645
How else are we gonna get him
to agree to what we want?

07:34.720 --> 07:36.927
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

07:38.880 --> 07:40.564
But I think I like it.

08:00.440 --> 08:01.726
Jeremiah.

08:02.240 --> 08:03.480
Well, this is a surprise.

08:03.560 --> 08:04.561
We need to talk.

08:04.640 --> 08:05.766
Yeah, of course, come on in.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.081
Something about the campaign?

08:09.240 --> 08:11.322
No, I don't wanna talk
about the campaign!

08:11.400 --> 08:12.401
Shut the door.

08:12.480 --> 08:13.845
All right.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.921
What's the problem? Rachel Wood.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.764
You were arrested
for her murder.

08:24.760 --> 08:27.206
Now, look, I had nothing
to do with her death.

08:27.280 --> 08:29.600
As you may have heard, the
charges were completely dropped.

08:29.920 --> 08:31.410
You were having
an affair with her.

08:32.960 --> 08:34.015
And that is none
of your business.

08:34.039 --> 08:35.849
It certainly is my business!

08:35.919 --> 08:37.284
We were friends,
I worked with her,

08:37.360 --> 08:39.124
we helped to get you elected.

08:39.200 --> 08:40.280
What's this about?

08:40.919 --> 08:42.206
I was there that night.

08:42.280 --> 08:43.280
Were you?

08:43.360 --> 08:45.408
I saw you go into her apartment.

08:45.800 --> 08:49.009
When I went in after you
left, she was dead.

08:50.440 --> 08:51.680
I found her body.

08:51.800 --> 08:53.211
Look, I didn't kill Rachel.

08:53.280 --> 08:55.601
I loved her, and you killed her!

08:58.400 --> 09:00.448
What do you want? Justice.

09:01.240 --> 09:02.730
And how do you expect
to get that?

09:02.800 --> 09:07.044
Why don't you think about how much
it'll cost to keep my mouth shut?

09:09.240 --> 09:10.890
You got 24 hours.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.247
Hello?

09:29.320 --> 09:30.731
It's me, can you talk?

09:30.840 --> 09:32.729
Yeah, I'm just
at the park with the kids.

09:32.840 --> 09:33.966
Are you okay?

09:34.040 --> 09:36.247
Yeah, are you?

09:36.320 --> 09:38.766
There may be a way to stop
Renard from becoming mayor.

09:38.840 --> 09:40.205
What? How?

09:40.280 --> 09:42.169
The Verfluchte
Zwillingsschwester.

09:42.240 --> 09:44.527
I can't do that,
I'm with the kids.

09:44.760 --> 09:46.171
No. Um...

09:46.240 --> 09:48.322
Eve is gonna do it for me.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.241
Oh. Um...

09:51.360 --> 09:53.576
So you're gonna need some of his hair.
When do you need it?

09:53.600 --> 09:54.965
As soon as possible.

09:55.040 --> 09:56.280
Where's Renard now?

09:56.360 --> 09:57.691
At the precinct, I think.

09:57.760 --> 09:58.966
Okay, go home.

09:59.040 --> 10:00.371
I'll send Monroe to you.

10:00.440 --> 10:01.536
He'll call before he comes up,

10:01.560 --> 10:03.289
but you have to be very careful.

10:03.360 --> 10:05.522
Renard can't know you had
anything to do with this-

10:06.160 --> 10:08.367
Nick, this better work.

10:08.440 --> 10:10.602
I can't spend another
night at that house.

10:10.680 --> 10:11.840
Hopefully, you won't have to.

10:15.040 --> 10:16.121
We're good.

10:16.200 --> 10:17.896
As you know, the new
captain of this precinct

10:17.920 --> 10:20.161
will be reporting directly
to the mayor's office.

10:20.240 --> 10:21.526
I understand.

10:21.640 --> 10:23.404
It would be an honor
to succeed you, sir.

10:23.480 --> 10:24.891
Yes, I know.

10:25.560 --> 10:29.087
Before I announce my decision, you're
gonna have to prove your loyalty.

10:30.240 --> 10:32.846
And not just
to the mayor's office,

10:32.920 --> 10:34.046
but to me.

10:36.720 --> 10:39.246
I'm ready anytime, sir.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.651
You got everything you need?

10:41.720 --> 10:42.846
Except for the hair.

10:42.920 --> 10:44.456
Are you sure you should be
handling all this stuff?

10:44.480 --> 10:45.760
I mean, now that
you're pregnant?

10:45.960 --> 10:49.248
I think I should be fine as long as
I don't breathe through the hat.

10:49.680 --> 10:52.365
And, seriously, is this even a
good idea in the first place?

10:52.440 --> 10:53.736
I mean, the last
time we did this,

10:53.760 --> 10:56.161
Juliette turned into a
pretty wicked Hexenbiest.

10:56.920 --> 10:59.571
I mean, not that it was
her fault, by the way.

10:59.640 --> 11:01.404
Adalind should be home
by now, you should go.

11:01.480 --> 11:03.642
Okay. How much hair do you need?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.207
Adalind will know, but get
back here as soon as you can.

11:06.600 --> 11:07.965
Okay, Okay.

11:08.360 --> 11:09.600
I'm out.

11:26.200 --> 11:27.247
What're you doing here?

11:27.320 --> 11:29.049
I have what you asked for.

11:29.840 --> 11:30.966
How much?

11:32.600 --> 11:34.284
If you want it, open the door.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.489
I guess you don't trust me.

11:45.440 --> 11:46.441
Show me the money.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.003
Now, how do I know
you'll stop threatening me?

11:55.080 --> 11:56.730
You killed the woman I love,

11:56.800 --> 11:58.456
you don't deserve an
answer to that question.

11:58.480 --> 12:00.369
I did not kill Rachel.

12:01.240 --> 12:03.925
If you're innocent, then
you wouldn't have paid.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.126
Oh, I'm not paying.

12:08.600 --> 12:09.647
You are.

12:33.560 --> 12:35.289
Sorry about the blood, sir.

12:38.360 --> 12:39.361
It'll wash out.

12:40.880 --> 12:43.804
Congratulations on
your promotion, Captain.

12:46.840 --> 12:49.446
And when you're
done cleaning up,

12:49.520 --> 12:51.045
come meet me
back at the precinct.

12:51.480 --> 12:53.209
Thank you for the
opportunity, sir.

13:11.920 --> 13:13.001
Monroe? Where are you?

13:13.080 --> 13:14.520
I'm across the street.
Are you alone?

13:14.560 --> 13:16.056
It's just me and the kids,
but they're asleep.

13:16.080 --> 13:19.004
Front door is open, I'm upstairs,
first door on the right.

13:19.080 --> 13:20.206
Okay-

13:27.040 --> 13:28.041
Okay-

13:30.560 --> 13:31.971
Adalind, get the hair? Oh. Yeah.

13:32.080 --> 13:33.650
Okay. Sure this is enough?

13:33.720 --> 13:35.006
It's all I could get. Okay.

13:35.080 --> 13:36.416
Where are you going?
The Spice Shop!

13:36.440 --> 13:37.726
Clothes!

13:37.800 --> 13:38.801
So, what's Eve gonna do?

13:38.920 --> 13:41.216
What do you mean, "What's Eve gonna
do?" She's gonna make the potion.

13:41.240 --> 13:42.376
I mean, after she
makes the potion,

13:42.400 --> 13:43.536
when she turns into the Captain.

13:43.560 --> 13:45.642
She's not turning into
the Captain, Nick is.

13:45.760 --> 13:46.841
Nick is?

13:46.920 --> 13:48.136
It'll be more believable,
you know,

13:48.160 --> 13:49.296
Nick being a cop and everything.

13:49.320 --> 13:50.376
Come on, I gotta get going!

13:50.400 --> 13:51.925
Wait, wait, wait! Shoes and tie.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.128
Ties are in the back.
Right. Okay.

13:54.560 --> 13:56.562
Oh! Blue or red? What?

13:56.640 --> 13:58.336
I don't know, blue might be
the smarter choice, you know,

13:58.360 --> 14:00.256
but I gotta say, a lot of people
like red, it's a power color,

14:00.280 --> 14:01.850
but Nick's not really
a tie type of guy,

14:01.920 --> 14:03.376
but then again, it's not
actually gonna be Nick...

14:03.400 --> 14:05.129
Oh, my God, just pick one!
Right. Right.

14:05.240 --> 14:07.129
I'll take them both.
Okay, hurry!

14:08.040 --> 14:09.800
Oh! Don't forget to keep
Renard home tonight.

14:09.840 --> 14:10.841
For how long?

14:10.920 --> 14:13.296
Nick just said he wants you to make
sure Renard sees the 7:00 news.

14:13.320 --> 14:14.321
Why?

14:14.400 --> 14:15.896
There's gonna be
some kind of announcement.

14:15.920 --> 14:16.967
Okay, just go!

14:20.360 --> 14:22.089
Somebody's here. Who's here?

14:24.200 --> 14:25.406
Crap, it's Sean.

14:25.480 --> 14:26.576
Well, how do I get out of here?

14:26.600 --> 14:27.601
You don't.

14:29.120 --> 14:30.565
Get in the closet. What?

14:30.680 --> 14:31.966
Just go!

14:32.880 --> 14:34.928
Oh, my God, are you serious?

14:35.000 --> 14:37.207
I don't like this idea one bit.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.564
Why are you home?

14:45.640 --> 14:46.641
I need a shirt.

14:47.040 --> 14:48.166
Is that blood?

14:48.400 --> 14:49.447
It's not important.

14:49.520 --> 14:50.931
Are you hurt? No.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.047
What happened?

14:52.160 --> 14:53.924
Well, someone thought
I killed Rachel.

14:54.240 --> 14:56.561
Thought it'd be worth a lot
of money not to say anything.

14:56.640 --> 14:58.529
So, that's not your blood.

14:58.600 --> 14:59.886
No.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.650
Blackmail is a risky business.

15:01.720 --> 15:03.927
Here, give it to me,
I'll get you a new shirt.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.161
No, I got it.

15:05.240 --> 15:08.210
I think there's some
blood in your hair, too.

15:08.280 --> 15:09.566
What? Where?

15:09.640 --> 15:11.165
Why don't you
just go take a shower.

15:11.720 --> 15:14.246
You don't want Diana to
see blood in your hair,

15:14.320 --> 15:16.049
or anyone else, either.

15:19.160 --> 15:20.844
Hang on a second.

15:22.680 --> 15:24.170
Why are you being so nice to me?

15:25.120 --> 15:27.361
Just trying to get
with the program.

15:44.680 --> 15:45.920
Go. Now.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.525
Oh, my God.

16:00.800 --> 16:03.485
It's almost ready, we need Renard's hair.
Where's Monroe?

16:03.560 --> 16:05.050
I'll call him.

16:07.800 --> 16:08.801
How much longer?

16:08.880 --> 16:10.325
Monroe's not back
yet with the hair.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.209
I'm calling him now.

16:13.600 --> 16:15.170
That better be you calling.

16:15.240 --> 16:16.241
What happened?

16:17.280 --> 16:19.760
Renard came home
while I was there.

16:19.840 --> 16:21.842
Did he see you? No, Adalind
hid me in the closet.

16:21.920 --> 16:23.570
Man, I gotta tell you,
she saved my ass.

16:23.640 --> 16:25.376
What was he doing home
in the middle of the day?

16:25.400 --> 16:26.536
Needed to come home
to change his shirt

16:26.560 --> 16:27.971
'cause there was blood on it.

16:28.040 --> 16:30.296
Something about a guy blackmailing
him because Rachel was killed.

16:30.320 --> 16:31.560
I think if we think about it,

16:31.640 --> 16:33.688
we could figure out
how the blood got there.

16:33.760 --> 16:34.886
Did you get the hair?

16:34.960 --> 16:36.121
Yeah, right here!

16:37.680 --> 16:39.170
Are you ready?

16:40.080 --> 16:41.206
Anything I should know?

16:41.680 --> 16:44.160
Just breathe deeply three times.

16:52.440 --> 16:53.440
Wait, wait!

16:53.480 --> 16:54.641
What?

16:54.720 --> 16:58.566
I'm just thinking, has this ever
been done on a Grimm before?

16:58.640 --> 16:59.687
I don't know.

16:59.760 --> 17:01.536
Well, we should look at the
books just to be safe.

17:01.560 --> 17:02.561
No, there's no time.

17:04.960 --> 17:05.961
Wait!

17:06.119 --> 17:07.121
What now?

17:07.240 --> 17:09.119
Your clothes. You should
probably take them off.

17:11.400 --> 17:12.481
Renard is bigger than you,

17:12.560 --> 17:13.576
the clothes that you're wearing

17:13.599 --> 17:14.880
are gonna be a little bit tight.

17:53.880 --> 17:55.644
Do you feel anything?

17:56.480 --> 17:58.050
No, not really.

17:59.880 --> 18:01.609
Shouldn't this be
happening by now?

18:01.680 --> 18:03.170
Maybe it doesn't
work on a Grimm.

18:03.240 --> 18:04.526
Maybe we mixed it wrong.

18:04.960 --> 18:06.564
I'll look at the books.

18:27.360 --> 18:29.089
Should it be
happening like this?

18:29.160 --> 18:30.161
It's working.

18:54.720 --> 18:56.688
Oh, my God!

19:06.920 --> 19:08.649
I don't think that's right.

19:08.720 --> 19:10.324
What's not right?

19:10.400 --> 19:11.925
You should take a look.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.729
Oh, no.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.241
I'm Woged?

19:19.320 --> 19:20.526
You cannot go out like that.

19:20.600 --> 19:21.726
How do I get rid of this?

19:21.760 --> 19:23.683
- You have to relax.
- Relax?

19:23.760 --> 19:25.056
You just turned me
into a Zauberbiest!

19:25.080 --> 19:27.367
You can't get out of
it until you calm down.

19:27.440 --> 19:28.616
You need to take
some deep breaths.

19:28.640 --> 19:29.687
Nick, Nick.

19:29.760 --> 19:30.761
Nick, listen to me!

19:30.840 --> 19:32.496
You can control this,
you just have to, like,

19:32.520 --> 19:34.409
let yourself
go emotionally, right?

19:34.480 --> 19:35.896
And then just, like,
Zen yourself out.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.445
Okay, that's not...
No, not helping.

19:37.560 --> 19:39.005
Easy, easy. Mmm-hmm.

19:39.080 --> 19:40.127
Mmm-hmm.

19:40.240 --> 19:41.605
You're gonna let it go, okay?

19:42.840 --> 19:44.524
Breathe.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.728
And breathe.

19:47.760 --> 19:48.841
Yeah.

19:48.920 --> 19:50.046
There you go.

19:51.560 --> 19:52.607
Yes!

19:53.640 --> 19:54.880
Oh, wow! That...

19:54.960 --> 19:56.007
That felt so weird.

19:57.280 --> 19:59.400
I gotta say, I've never been
this happy to see Renard.

19:59.440 --> 20:01.442
It's 6:30.

20:01.520 --> 20:03.096
You don't have much time,
you need to get dressed.

20:03.120 --> 20:04.884
Yeah. Yeah.

20:04.960 --> 20:06.849
Several large
newspapers across the nation

20:06.920 --> 20:08.604
have announced layoffs this week

20:08.680 --> 20:10.569
from their print
media divisions.

20:10.640 --> 20:11.640
The papers all report

20:11.680 --> 20:13.648
dwindling sales numbers
as the reason for the...

20:13.720 --> 20:16.405
Now that you're here, why
don't you just stay home?

20:16.480 --> 20:17.925
Gotta get back to the office.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.082
Why? We can make dinner!

20:20.400 --> 20:21.526
Can't.

20:21.880 --> 20:23.291
Sean, if you want
this to work out,

20:23.360 --> 20:25.176
we're gonna have to be
spending more time together.

20:25.200 --> 20:27.567
I understand, just not tonight.

20:27.640 --> 20:29.136
Well, there are things
we need to talk about.

20:29.160 --> 20:30.730
Like what? Well, your
daughter, for one.

20:30.800 --> 20:32.256
Diana? Why, has she
killed somebody else?

20:32.280 --> 20:35.170
No, Sean, she hasn't killed anyone
else, but she has other issues.

20:35.240 --> 20:36.856
Look, can we just talk
about this later, please?

20:36.880 --> 20:38.696
You wanna put off talking
about your own daughter?

20:38.720 --> 20:40.120
I mean, what kind
of father are you?

20:40.160 --> 20:42.527
Okay. All right. What?

20:43.120 --> 20:46.010
Well, her education for one.

20:46.720 --> 20:48.290
Her education?

20:48.360 --> 20:50.647
What about it? I mean,
she's gonna go to school.

20:50.720 --> 20:53.121
Of course, she's going
to go to school, but, where?

20:53.200 --> 20:54.611
I don't know, just pick a place.

20:54.680 --> 20:56.330
It's Diana, it's not that easy!

20:56.440 --> 20:58.656
I mean, what if she gets into a
fight with a kid on the playground?

20:58.680 --> 21:01.206
Or what if one of her teachers
gives her a time out?

21:01.320 --> 21:03.288
That might be a forever
time out for the teacher.

21:03.360 --> 21:04.616
Well, we'll just
have to explain to her

21:04.640 --> 21:06.936
that there are certain boundaries,
all right? We'll work it out.

21:06.960 --> 21:08.928
No, I mean, she can't
go to public school,

21:09.000 --> 21:10.096
she can't go to private school,

21:10.120 --> 21:11.296
we certainly
can't home school her,

21:11.320 --> 21:13.016
I would go insane...
Can we deal with this later?

21:13.040 --> 21:14.816
But if she doesn't go to school,
she'll have no friends.

21:14.840 --> 21:16.729
I mean,
she'll have no sleepovers,

21:16.800 --> 21:18.609
no play-dates, she'll
have zero social skills!

21:18.680 --> 21:19.736
How are we gonna deal with this?

21:19.760 --> 21:21.285
Okay, all right, I get it!

21:21.360 --> 21:22.441
Okay?

21:24.040 --> 21:26.281
I guess, I could
be a little late.

21:26.360 --> 21:27.486
What's on your mind?

21:28.840 --> 21:30.649
Well, a lot of stuff.

21:35.280 --> 21:36.281
Wow!

21:36.920 --> 21:38.809
You look exactly like him.

21:38.880 --> 21:42.407
Yeah, exactly. I mean,
every hair is perfect.

21:43.360 --> 21:46.489
Oh. A little weird
being this tall.

21:47.320 --> 21:48.321
Hmm.

21:51.600 --> 21:53.807
Something wrong?
The way you move.

21:53.880 --> 21:54.927
What do you mean?

21:55.040 --> 21:56.087
It's a little off.

21:56.160 --> 21:57.525
"Off"? Off how?

21:57.600 --> 22:00.570
It's, uh, not quite
Renard enough.

22:00.640 --> 22:01.641
Yeah. Yeah.

22:01.720 --> 22:04.963
You need to be a
little more Renardy.

22:07.240 --> 22:08.366
More full of yourself.

22:08.480 --> 22:09.686
Oh.

22:10.240 --> 22:11.401
A lot more.

22:13.960 --> 22:15.405
Oh! Exactly.

22:15.520 --> 22:17.443
Like you were just elected
Mayor of Portland.

22:17.560 --> 22:19.324
Mmm-hmm. And you think
you deserve it.

22:21.920 --> 22:23.604
And you want
Nick Burkhardt dead.

22:25.480 --> 22:26.520
That's it! That's perfect.

22:26.560 --> 22:27.641
There you go! Nailed it!

22:27.720 --> 22:29.688
Monroe? Rosalee?

22:29.760 --> 22:31.125
Hank, back here!

22:32.920 --> 22:34.524
I told you to give
me your resignation!

22:34.600 --> 22:36.250
I gave you my damn resignation!

22:40.080 --> 22:41.206
Pretty good, huh?

22:43.000 --> 22:44.809
Nick? Yeah, sorry.

22:45.040 --> 22:48.840
No, no! No, that's...
That had to hurt.

22:48.920 --> 22:50.809
Oh, yeah, yeah.

22:50.880 --> 22:53.884
Okay, let's do this.

22:55.960 --> 22:57.371
It's time for Live at Seven.

22:57.480 --> 22:58.720
All right, look,

22:58.800 --> 23:00.689
maybe I haven't given
Diana's education

23:00.760 --> 23:01.816
a lot of thought, all right?

23:01.840 --> 23:03.444
But considering everything

23:03.520 --> 23:04.851
that's been going on recently...

23:04.920 --> 23:06.604
I mean, look.

23:06.680 --> 23:10.127
Look, her education is just as
important to me as it is to you,

23:10.240 --> 23:12.686
but right now I have to go.

23:12.760 --> 23:16.560
You don't know how happy that
makes me to hear you say that.

23:16.640 --> 23:17.880
Adalind, please, I have to go.

23:18.000 --> 23:23.245
I know you have to go and
that is why it is so amazing

23:23.320 --> 23:26.085
that you've stayed here
to talk about our daughter.

23:26.160 --> 23:27.161
Mmm-hmm.

23:27.240 --> 23:29.368
You are an amazing father!

23:29.440 --> 23:31.761
Okay. It's... Yeah, I just...
And...

23:31.840 --> 23:33.330
Citizens of Portland,

23:34.240 --> 23:37.449
it is with great sadness that
I stand before you tonight-

23:39.600 --> 23:42.251
Now, I wish to say that
I am profoundly grateful

23:42.320 --> 23:44.687
to the people of this wonderful
city... What the hell?

23:44.760 --> 23:46.922
For electing me their mayor.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.800
But it has become apparent that the
recent attack on the North Precinct

23:50.880 --> 23:52.848
will require my full attention,

23:52.920 --> 23:56.447
and I am, therefore,
abdicating the mayorship.

23:56.520 --> 23:57.521
What?

23:57.600 --> 23:59.284
I cannot, in good conscience,

23:59.360 --> 24:02.204
leave the police department
at its time of greatest need.

24:02.280 --> 24:05.568
And I truly believe that I can
best serve the City of Port/and...

24:05.640 --> 24:06.971
When did you record this?

24:07.040 --> 24:09.441
I didn't record this, it's live!

24:09.520 --> 24:12.444
The recent manhunt
for Detective Nick Burkhardt

24:12.520 --> 24:15.126
was actually
an undercover investigation

24:15.200 --> 24:17.646
staged to bring the
real killer to justice.

24:17.720 --> 24:19.927
And now, since this is
an ongoing investigation,

24:20.000 --> 24:21.490
I cannot further comment,

24:21.560 --> 24:24.006
but I would like to
thank Detective Burkhardt

24:24.720 --> 24:26.688
for his exemplary work

24:26.760 --> 24:30.606
and congratulate him
on a job well done.

24:30.680 --> 24:33.445
No, no, no! No! No!

24:44.280 --> 24:48.001
If I find out that you had
anything to do with this...

25:11.000 --> 25:13.082
You were unbelievable
on the news!

25:13.160 --> 25:14.207
The whole precinct saw it.

25:14.280 --> 25:15.850
This is Nick, right?
Yeah, it's me.

25:15.920 --> 25:18.127
Okay, great. Because
that was amazing.

25:18.200 --> 25:20.362
You were so him, Nick, Renard
must be going ballistic.

25:20.720 --> 25:22.484
Hey,
just got a text from Adalind.

25:22.560 --> 25:25.291
She says Renard saw the whole
thing, he's on his way here.

25:25.360 --> 25:26.441
We don't have much time.

25:26.520 --> 25:27.521
All right, wait here,

25:27.600 --> 25:29.443
stop him if he comes this way.

25:32.800 --> 25:34.370
Looking forward to it.

25:35.720 --> 25:37.245
Welcome back, Captain.

25:37.320 --> 25:38.810
That man is a class act!

25:41.640 --> 25:43.096
You get his computer,
I'll get his files.

25:43.120 --> 25:45.646
All right, don't you mean your
files and your computer, sir?

25:45.720 --> 25:47.006
Right. Sorry.

25:56.960 --> 25:58.803
Can I have a word
with you, Captain?

25:59.680 --> 26:01.170
Can you tell me
what this is about?

26:01.240 --> 26:03.561
It's about the operation
we discussed earlier, sir.

26:06.880 --> 26:08.041
It's important.

26:10.160 --> 26:11.207
Sure.

26:11.280 --> 26:12.805
Detective,
would you give me a minute?

26:12.880 --> 26:15.247
Don't forget you have that
meeting you can't be late for?

26:15.320 --> 26:16.651
Be right there.

26:23.800 --> 26:26.849
What the hell is going on?
We had a deal.

26:27.680 --> 26:28.841
What about it?

26:29.760 --> 26:31.364
I proved my loyalty-

26:32.240 --> 26:33.241
Uh-huh.

26:35.400 --> 26:38.529
I got rid of the body, I wiped
down the whole damn house.

26:38.880 --> 26:40.086
To prove your loyalty.

26:40.200 --> 26:42.202
Yes, to prove my loyalty.

26:43.080 --> 26:44.491
And you did.

26:44.560 --> 26:49.088
Look, if I don't take
over this department,

26:49.160 --> 26:50.525
you and I are gonna
have a problem.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.288
Because you were gonna
take over as captain.

26:54.360 --> 26:55.566
That was the deal.

26:55.640 --> 26:57.802
Now, I killed the man
in front of you,

26:57.880 --> 26:59.450
I kept my part of the bargain.

26:59.520 --> 27:00.965
And then you got
blood on my shirt.

27:01.040 --> 27:02.451
Seriously?

27:02.520 --> 27:04.536
I tear the throat out of a
man who's blackmailing you,

27:04.560 --> 27:06.680
you're complaining about a
little blood on your shirt?

27:06.840 --> 27:11.641
Well, that's what I consider a deal
breaker, Lieutenant Grossante.

27:11.720 --> 27:13.404
So unless you wanna
be arrested for murder,

27:13.480 --> 27:15.528
I suggest that you get the
hell out of my office.

27:20.760 --> 27:22.683
Or you could die right here.

27:30.680 --> 27:31.966
I won't forget this.

27:32.040 --> 27:35.249
And neither will I, Lieutenant.
Neither will I.

27:40.760 --> 27:41.921
What was that about?

27:43.200 --> 27:44.960
Apparently, he was gonna
be your new captain.

27:48.440 --> 27:49.487
What's wrong?

27:52.800 --> 27:53.961
I think I'm turning back.

27:54.080 --> 27:56.162
We need to get you out of here.
Yeah.

27:57.440 --> 28:00.011
Good morning,
I'm from Springwells.

28:00.080 --> 28:01.809
Captain! Captain!

28:01.880 --> 28:03.370
Captain! Just a moment!

28:03.440 --> 28:04.487
Captain, wait!

28:06.200 --> 28:07.406
Captain, can you tell us more

28:07.480 --> 28:08.891
about abdicating the mayorship?

28:08.960 --> 28:11.201
Has an arrest been made
in the North Precinct attack?

28:11.280 --> 28:13.851
How difficult a decision was
it to remain on the force?

28:26.160 --> 28:27.241
Captain!

28:27.320 --> 28:28.481
Get out of my way.

28:28.600 --> 28:30.329
You don't wanna go in there.

28:30.400 --> 28:32.767
'Cause you're already in there.

28:32.840 --> 28:34.922
Might be a little awkward.

28:35.880 --> 28:36.961
Just saying.

28:42.800 --> 28:45.883
I have no intention of ever
running for mayor again,

28:45.960 --> 28:48.327
or any other political office.

28:48.400 --> 28:50.482
So, uh, this is where I'm needed

28:50.560 --> 28:53.040
and this is where
I'm gonna stay.

28:53.120 --> 28:54.246
If you'll excuse me.

28:54.320 --> 28:57.244
Can you tell us anything else
about the undercover operation?

28:57.320 --> 28:59.891
Actually, yes, only that
Detective Burkhardt

28:59.960 --> 29:01.769
and his partner,
Detective Griffin,

29:01.840 --> 29:03.763
and of course Sergeant Wu

29:03.840 --> 29:04.921
did an exemplary job.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.256
Captain, we really
do need to go.

29:06.280 --> 29:08.408
Yes. Thank you, thank you all.

29:08.480 --> 29:10.608
All right.
The press in this city

29:10.680 --> 29:13.206
has been outstanding. Thank you.

29:15.320 --> 29:17.084
You will not get away with this.

29:17.160 --> 29:18.336
Sure gonna be interesting to see

29:18.360 --> 29:21.330
how you handle this, sir.

29:31.480 --> 29:33.767
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

29:33.840 --> 29:36.411
The people of this city
elected me as mayor!

29:36.480 --> 29:38.801
And they'll be forever
grateful for my efforts.

29:38.920 --> 29:40.649
I did the right thing.

29:40.720 --> 29:43.291
I put the best interests of
this city ahead of my own.

29:43.360 --> 29:44.646
Shut up, you're not me!

29:45.080 --> 29:46.605
- Wu, start the car!
- He's still here!

29:46.720 --> 29:48.760
Captain! The citizens
of Portland deserve to know...

29:48.800 --> 29:51.087
Be careful. My
reputation's on the line.

29:51.160 --> 29:52.616
How long was this
undercover operation...

29:52.640 --> 29:54.160
Any idea who will
replace you as mayor?

29:54.760 --> 29:57.001
Look, I'm not abdicating the mayorship,
all right?

29:57.080 --> 29:58.684
I have no intention
of stepping down.

29:58.760 --> 30:01.331
Can you clarify
your position, sir?

30:01.400 --> 30:02.686
Yeah, that wasn't me!

30:02.760 --> 30:03.966
Then who was it?

30:06.400 --> 30:09.563
Weren't you just wearing
a different tie, sir?

30:12.880 --> 30:14.041
They're here.

30:18.080 --> 30:19.081
Come on, come on.

30:19.160 --> 30:21.367
You were great! We
watched the whole thing.

30:21.440 --> 30:22.851
Yeah, I believed every word.

30:23.840 --> 30:25.160
Couldn't have
done it without you.

30:26.560 --> 30:29.086
I'll start going through
Renard's computer and files.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.401
Get the names of every person
he's been in contact with

30:31.480 --> 30:33.084
since Dixon was assassinated.

30:33.160 --> 30:34.605
When's this gonna
wear off, anyway?

30:34.680 --> 30:35.776
Are you starting
to feel anything?

30:35.800 --> 30:36.801
Oh, yeah.

30:36.880 --> 30:38.723
I got hammered back
in Renard's office.

30:38.800 --> 30:40.040
Felt like I got hit by a truck.

30:40.080 --> 30:42.003
What? Yeah, it nearly
knocked him down.

30:42.080 --> 30:43.161
Nothing else happened?

30:43.240 --> 30:45.561
No, no. I came straight here.

30:48.640 --> 30:49.641
What?

30:49.800 --> 30:51.768
That was your body
trying to turn back.

30:52.040 --> 30:53.166
What do you mean?

30:53.240 --> 30:55.607
The pain Nick felt was
the spell wearing off.

30:55.680 --> 30:57.444
- But it didn't wear off.
- So what happened?

30:57.520 --> 30:58.726
Or didn't happen?

30:58.800 --> 30:59.801
I don't know.

30:59.920 --> 31:01.604
Unless

31:01.680 --> 31:03.205
it's because you're a Grimm.

31:03.960 --> 31:05.041
Wait a minute.

31:05.120 --> 31:06.849
Are you saying Nick might be,

31:06.920 --> 31:09.924
like, stuck as Renard forever?

31:24.120 --> 31:26.088
Where the hell is my computer?

31:29.480 --> 31:31.130
Where the hell is my briefcase?

31:31.800 --> 31:33.296
There's probably
something in Nick's DNA

31:33.320 --> 31:35.402
that isn't allowing him
to turn back into himself.

31:35.480 --> 31:37.403
There must be some way
to reverse this effect.

31:37.480 --> 31:38.776
I know the thought
of looking like Renard

31:38.800 --> 31:41.121
for the rest of your life
is kind of daunting,

31:41.200 --> 31:43.931
but nobody's saying
this is permanent. Yet.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.401
He's right. Nick, look, there
must be all kinds of spells

31:46.480 --> 31:48.130
that could work
great on reversing

31:48.200 --> 31:50.202
whatever's going
on here, right, Eve?

31:50.280 --> 31:51.611
I know. I'm looking.

31:51.720 --> 31:53.484
I'm gonna help you.
Just don't panic, okay?

31:53.560 --> 31:55.847
Whatever you do. We're
gonna figure this out.

31:56.560 --> 31:57.561
It's Renard.

31:59.040 --> 32:01.441
Hey, Captain. How you doing?

32:01.520 --> 32:02.760
Put him on the phone.

32:03.920 --> 32:05.160
He wants to talk to you.

32:13.080 --> 32:14.445
Thought I might hear from you.

32:14.520 --> 32:15.965
So it hasn't worn off yet?

32:16.040 --> 32:17.610
Nope, it hasn't worn off yet.

32:17.680 --> 32:20.570
And it won't unless we
come to an agreement.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.480
"And it won't unless we
come to an agreement."

32:23.560 --> 32:26.450
You think it's pretty
clever what you did.

32:26.520 --> 32:28.966
But this little game
is over as of right now.

32:29.040 --> 32:31.122
It's not a game,
and it's not over.

32:31.200 --> 32:32.496
Now, if you think
Portland's big enough

32:32.520 --> 32:34.648
for two Sean Renards,
think again.

32:34.720 --> 32:36.404
You'll always be
contradicting yourself,

32:36.480 --> 32:37.696
no one is ever
gonna believe you.

32:37.720 --> 32:40.007
They might just think you're
crazy and lock you up.

32:40.080 --> 32:42.082
Well, then I better
have a talk with myself.

32:42.160 --> 32:43.446
Face to face.

32:43.520 --> 32:46.444
My loft, 20 minutes.
I'll be on the roof.

32:50.200 --> 32:53.329
Renard only has one thing
he can use against you.

32:53.400 --> 32:54.401
My son.

32:55.880 --> 32:57.696
Can you get Adalind and the
kids, bring them back here?

32:57.720 --> 32:58.976
Look, I should go with you.
No, no.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.206
I'll know if he's not alone.

33:00.280 --> 33:01.645
He doesn't know
about the tunnels.

33:01.720 --> 33:04.849
You go with Hank in case
Renard put someone on Adalind.

33:04.960 --> 33:06.530
We'll find a way
to get you back.

33:11.560 --> 33:12.686
Be careful.

33:46.160 --> 33:48.527
So, if I shoot you, is
that considered suicide?

33:49.160 --> 33:51.162
I thought we were here to talk.

33:53.120 --> 33:55.441
At least one of me
is good for my word.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.256
I really think there's only room

34:01.280 --> 34:03.203
for one of me in this city.

34:08.600 --> 34:10.806
Which one is that gonna be?

34:17.800 --> 34:19.484
Thought I'd give you that one.

34:20.159 --> 34:22.161
I know how much you're
hurting right now.

34:40.480 --> 34:41.686
Knew that was coming.

34:41.760 --> 34:43.922
What did you expect?
A fair fight?

34:44.199 --> 34:45.850
Not from you.

35:16.560 --> 35:19.131
There has to be
some way to bring him back.

35:19.480 --> 35:21.130
If there is, it isn't here.

35:21.200 --> 35:22.770
Not finding anything
in any of the books

35:22.840 --> 35:26.003
about a Grimm going through a
spell of any kind without dying.

35:26.440 --> 35:28.249
Well, maybe we just...

35:28.320 --> 35:29.481
We start over, okay?

35:29.560 --> 35:30.766
We just do the spell on Nick

35:30.840 --> 35:32.360
like we're doing it
for the first time,

35:32.400 --> 35:34.209
except we'll turn
the Captain into Nick.

35:34.280 --> 35:36.336
That's a great idea. Then all
we need is some of Nick's hair.

35:36.360 --> 35:38.647
That won't work. We would
be doing a spell on a spell

35:38.720 --> 35:40.848
and there's still no guarantee
it wouldn't kill Nick.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.286
She fell asleep in the car.

35:43.360 --> 35:45.010
I made up the cot.

35:51.960 --> 35:53.405
Where's Nick?

35:53.480 --> 35:54.481
Uh...

35:54.760 --> 35:56.683
He's, uh, still with Renard.

35:56.800 --> 35:58.325
The spell didn't wear off.

35:58.400 --> 36:00.721
What? Nick is still Renard?

36:00.800 --> 36:03.201
We think it has something to
do with him being a Grimm.

36:03.280 --> 36:05.123
You know more about these
spells than anyone.

36:05.440 --> 36:08.091
Walk me through
exactly what you did.

36:18.480 --> 36:19.481
Oh!

36:21.160 --> 36:22.525
We could do this all night.

36:22.600 --> 36:24.284
It won't change a damn thing.

36:24.360 --> 36:25.850
No, it won't.

36:26.600 --> 36:28.011
I want my life back!

36:28.120 --> 36:29.360
Yeah, so do I.

36:30.480 --> 36:31.811
But I get to be mayor.

36:32.600 --> 36:33.761
Not gonna happen.

36:34.760 --> 36:37.286
You already quit. And everybody
in Portland knows it.

36:37.640 --> 36:39.961
HW is dead in Portland, Nick.

36:40.040 --> 36:41.610
So you got no one
backing you up.

36:41.960 --> 36:45.328
Yeah, so is Black Claw, Sean.

36:45.400 --> 36:48.563
With Bonaparte dead, you got
no one to back you up, either.

36:48.640 --> 36:52.122
Yeah, well, someone's going down
for the North Precinct attack,

36:52.200 --> 36:53.611
and that's not gonna be me.

36:53.680 --> 36:56.684
Yeah, well, someone's going
down for killing Bonaparte,

36:56.760 --> 36:57.886
and it's not gonna be me.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.411
So, how do we do this?

37:02.080 --> 37:04.321
Blame the North Precinct
attack on Bonaparte.

37:04.560 --> 37:05.561
How does that work?

37:05.640 --> 37:08.803
Corrupt oops under Bonaparte's
control got greedy.

37:09.320 --> 37:11.084
They went after him,
he went after them.

37:11.160 --> 37:12.810
That's why you resigned
the mayorship.

37:12.880 --> 37:14.848
You wanted to lead
this investigation.

37:18.280 --> 37:20.248
You really think we can go
back to the way it was?

37:21.480 --> 37:24.290
No, but we'll figure out
a way to make it work.

37:25.320 --> 37:26.481
For both of us.

37:27.480 --> 37:28.845
It's the only way.

37:32.680 --> 37:34.250
I suppose you want
your old job back.

37:34.320 --> 37:36.800
Not just me. Wu and Hank, too.

37:36.880 --> 37:38.370
Sure. Anything else?

37:38.440 --> 37:39.771
Yeah, I raise my son.

37:39.840 --> 37:41.205
I raise my daughter.

37:42.440 --> 37:43.930
And Adalind comes with me.

37:47.680 --> 37:48.727
Eh, take her.

37:50.880 --> 37:54.202
But-just remember,
Diana loves her daddy.

37:54.280 --> 37:57.489
And she would hate it if anything
bad were to ever happen to him.

38:02.880 --> 38:07.283
And if I ever see another me
again, this deal is dead.

38:08.360 --> 38:09.486
And so are you.

38:13.680 --> 38:15.091
You did everything right.

38:15.160 --> 38:16.456
Nick should've
turned back by now.

38:16.480 --> 38:18.608
Then it has to be
because he's a Grimm.

38:18.680 --> 38:20.011
Then what are we gonna do?

38:20.080 --> 38:21.161
There's nothing we can do.

38:21.280 --> 38:23.216
What are we gonna tell him? We
have to tell him the truth.

38:23.240 --> 38:25.811
If Nick is stuck as the Captain
for the rest of his life,

38:25.880 --> 38:28.121
he's gonna blow his brains out.

38:28.840 --> 38:30.126
Hey, Nick.

38:30.480 --> 38:32.448
Not yet.

38:32.760 --> 38:33.761
What happened?

38:34.720 --> 38:36.563
We came to an understanding.

38:36.640 --> 38:37.687
Yeah, looks like it.

38:37.760 --> 38:39.000
So, what's the deal?

38:39.080 --> 38:41.401
Renard's gonna stick to what
I said on the news tonight.

38:41.480 --> 38:42.845
And you're no longer on the run?

38:42.920 --> 38:44.001
That's the deal.

38:44.080 --> 38:45.880
What about us? NICK: We
all get our jobs back.

38:45.920 --> 38:48.571
And Renard's the captain.
That'll be interesting.

38:48.680 --> 38:50.409
One big happy family.

38:50.480 --> 38:51.925
Do I have to go
back with Renard?

38:52.000 --> 38:53.889
No. You're coming with me.

38:55.800 --> 38:57.609
But he wants Diana with him.

38:58.360 --> 38:59.771
I'm not giving up my daughter.

38:59.840 --> 39:00.841
You don't have to,

39:00.920 --> 39:02.280
but you're gonna
have to share her.

39:03.640 --> 39:04.976
If you try to keep
her away from him,

39:05.000 --> 39:06.604
it might only make things worse.

39:06.960 --> 39:11.010
Um, small question, don't
wanna rock any boats here,

39:11.080 --> 39:12.650
but how do we know
this is really Nick

39:12.720 --> 39:14.688
and not the Captain
trying to trick us?

39:14.760 --> 39:17.366
Oh, he's right.
Nick could be dead.

39:19.520 --> 39:22.729
It's not Renard, it's me.
I just can't get out of this.

39:22.800 --> 39:24.006
That sounds good,

39:24.080 --> 39:26.606
but that's exactly
what Renard would say.

39:28.840 --> 39:31.730
We need to ask him a question
only Nick would know.

39:31.800 --> 39:33.325
Where was our first kiss?

39:38.320 --> 39:40.368
At the table in my loft.

39:40.480 --> 39:43.131
Or at the Bremen Ruins
where I took your powers.

39:44.400 --> 39:46.801
That was not a kiss.

39:47.120 --> 39:48.201
It's Nick.

39:49.680 --> 39:50.720
I wanna hug you right now,

39:50.760 --> 39:54.207
but I can't hug this.

39:54.520 --> 39:57.126
Has someone figured out a way
to get me out of this?

40:01.080 --> 40:02.206
I take it that's a no.

40:02.480 --> 40:04.130
It might be
because of who you are.

40:04.200 --> 40:05.725
There might not be
a way out of it.

40:05.840 --> 40:07.171
Well, I can't stay like this.

40:07.240 --> 40:09.004
Nick, we're not
going to give up.

40:10.520 --> 40:11.806
Daddy?

40:18.320 --> 40:20.163
What happened to your face?

40:22.240 --> 40:25.005
Daddy just had
a little accident, honey.

40:26.600 --> 40:28.125
Yeah, I, uh...

40:32.200 --> 40:33.440
I'm okay.

40:43.320 --> 40:44.731
You're not my daddy!

40:48.920 --> 40:50.445
No, honey, honey.

40:50.520 --> 40:53.444
Nick is just trapped in Daddy's
body, it's not his fault.

41:15.800 --> 41:16.801
Nick?

41:19.480 --> 41:20.686
Yeah.

41:55.600 --> 41:58.604
So, how did it go?

42:05.120 --> 42:06.724
I tried to tell you.

42:16.280 --> 42:18.248
You chose the wrong side, Sean.
