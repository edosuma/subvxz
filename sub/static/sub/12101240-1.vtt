Jj

01:25.085 --> 01:27.076
Jj

04:25.098 --> 04:27.089
Jj

04:34.858 --> 04:37.349
Damon hickey, America's top cop,

04:37.444 --> 04:40.561
was gunned down on the front steps
of his home this morning.

04:40.655 --> 04:44.694
Authorities believe it might be
retribution from a drug cartel.

04:44.785 --> 04:48.369
He is listed
in extremely critical condition.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.446
Jj

05:16.733 --> 05:19.725
Jj

05:19.820 --> 05:22.983
Damon hickey, America's
police commisioner, was released today

05:23.073 --> 05:26.315
after making a miraculous recovery
from a gunshot wound.

05:29.329 --> 05:33.368
Unfortunately, hickey will be confined
to a wheelchair for the rest of his life.

05:33.458 --> 05:36.950
He spoke to reporters as he was released
and seemed in good spirits.

05:37.045 --> 05:39.036
Jj

06:33.018 --> 06:35.634
Jj

06:37.397 --> 06:40.514
Bless me, father,
for I have sinned.

06:44.696 --> 06:48.564
It's been two weeks
since my last confession.

06:50.035 --> 06:51.366
Proceed.

06:53.121 --> 06:56.409
You already know my sins, Tom.

06:56.499 --> 06:57.909
I do.

06:58.001 --> 06:59.457
And also already know

06:59.544 --> 07:02.752
that I've stepped off the righteous path.

07:04.799 --> 07:07.256
Well, we all have.

07:07.344 --> 07:09.926
A million six from the south side.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.173
Drug money was a little light this month,

07:14.267 --> 07:18.977
and prostitution was down a little too,
under 800,000.

07:19.064 --> 07:23.478
Gambling's up. The skim was
a million one last month.

07:25.737 --> 07:29.229
Is there any way to come back to the path?

07:30.367 --> 07:31.777
Are you serious?

07:36.456 --> 07:37.866
I'm not sure.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.374
But it feels good to contemplate it.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.792
I am a friend,

07:42.879 --> 07:46.497
and I do not have the spiritual answer

07:46.591 --> 07:48.798
you're looking for.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.628
There's a woman...

07:55.767 --> 07:58.099
- Your caretaker?
- Yes.

08:00.105 --> 08:03.097
- Are you having impure thoughts?
- No, no, no.

08:03.191 --> 08:06.854
She's in a tough spot with her daughter.

08:08.697 --> 08:11.234
And you want to help.

08:12.367 --> 08:14.699
It would help me to help her.

08:18.206 --> 08:21.619
- How about the pickups?
- Same spots.

08:23.294 --> 08:25.330
I hear there's a problem.

08:27.090 --> 08:29.502
- Same problem?
- Yes.

08:29.592 --> 08:32.674
Ahem. That rumor's been around forever.

08:32.761 --> 08:37.927
Yeah, but I understand this time
they're taking it very seriously.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.259
So let them.

08:42.522 --> 08:46.765
All these things going on
and you can sleep at night?

08:47.777 --> 08:49.813
I keep everyone else awake.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.022
I sleep just fine.

09:24.981 --> 09:27.017
You hit him too hard.

09:27.108 --> 09:31.568
I don't believe
we hit him hard enough.

09:31.654 --> 09:33.440
Don't be nodding out on us.

09:37.202 --> 09:39.568
Wake up! Wake up!

09:43.041 --> 09:45.202
What if we're wrong
about this guy?

09:47.378 --> 09:49.744
If we're wrong, we're just wrong.

09:49.839 --> 09:52.455
If he comes out of his coma,
he's gonna lawyer up.

09:52.550 --> 09:55.166
He's gonna go after all of us.

09:58.973 --> 10:01.180
I don't think he's coming out of anything.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.928
Shit.

10:04.729 --> 10:07.436
Fuck! What did you do?

10:07.524 --> 10:09.640
What did / do?

10:09.734 --> 10:11.895
You mean what did we do.

10:11.986 --> 10:14.102
Don't start that shit, boy.

10:14.197 --> 10:15.812
We're in this thing together.

10:15.907 --> 10:20.150
You... you need to remember
who your friends are.

10:20.245 --> 10:22.531
Don't get soft on us now.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.954
Remember, you begged us
to let you in on this.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.245
- Hey, guys.
- Not now.

10:28.336 --> 10:29.997
- Fuck!
- Guys...

10:30.213 --> 10:31.544
Not now, b.J.

10:31.840 --> 10:34.377
He's got to have
hidden it on him somewhere.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.628
Check his pants. Check his pants.

10:36.719 --> 10:38.550
I'm not doing that.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.263
Jj

10:44.269 --> 10:45.349
Kehoe!

10:45.436 --> 10:46.516
Shut up!

10:48.356 --> 10:49.356
Guys...

10:49.440 --> 10:50.555
I said, "shut up!"

10:54.154 --> 10:55.154
Kehoe!

10:58.074 --> 11:00.565
Fuck! It 'aint here!

11:00.660 --> 11:02.805
Maybe you should fish around
down there a little bit more.

11:02.829 --> 11:03.944
Fuck you!

11:04.038 --> 11:05.653
Hey!

11:05.748 --> 11:07.454
Looking for this?

11:07.542 --> 11:10.204
Son of a bitch.

11:10.295 --> 11:11.501
Where did you find that?

11:11.588 --> 11:12.828
In his locker.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.418
Nice fucking timing, b.J.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.752
It's a good find.

11:21.055 --> 11:22.261
Thank you.

11:22.348 --> 11:23.884
You were right.

11:25.059 --> 11:27.220
Son of a bitch was gonna rat us out.

11:28.229 --> 11:30.345
I'm always right.
That's why I'm in charge.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.305
This ain't over, you know?

11:32.400 --> 11:34.015
There has to be other tapes.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.850
We don't know who else
he's been talking to.

11:35.945 --> 11:38.732
Why don't you leave that to me

11:38.823 --> 11:41.906
and people above your pay grade,
Stevens?

11:45.330 --> 11:47.161
Now get his ass out of here.

11:47.248 --> 11:48.408
Got it.

11:53.087 --> 11:56.079
Jj

12:26.579 --> 12:28.444
Hello?

12:29.457 --> 12:30.867
Hey, it's kehoe.

12:30.959 --> 12:32.290
(Go ahead.

12:33.294 --> 12:36.411
Well, it ain't good.
He was wearing a wire.

12:36.506 --> 12:38.121
Fuck.

12:39.133 --> 12:41.374
All right, well, you better get over
to his house.

12:41.469 --> 12:44.051
Won't be long before some other agency
gets wind of this,

12:44.138 --> 12:45.594
if they haven't already.

12:46.599 --> 12:47.884
You bet.

12:47.976 --> 12:51.093
What are we going to do about the pickups?

12:51.187 --> 12:52.927
I just have to figure something out.

12:53.022 --> 12:54.387
Send one of us.

12:54.482 --> 12:57.019
No, no, absolutely not.
Don't know who's watching.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.642
Who the hell can we trust?

13:01.948 --> 13:03.028
I et me handle it.

13:08.997 --> 13:11.488
Hey, Damon.

13:11.582 --> 13:13.664
I'm sorry we're late.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.207
No worries.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.503
How's my sweet little angel?

13:24.012 --> 13:25.843
Something wrong, honey?

13:25.930 --> 13:27.921
Jj

13:29.809 --> 13:31.845
Let's make you some dinner, huh?

13:33.521 --> 13:34.636
Okay.

13:36.733 --> 13:38.269
Come on, baby.

14:15.271 --> 14:16.636
Hey, baby...

14:16.731 --> 14:19.393
Everything's gonna be okay, I promise.

14:19.484 --> 14:21.349
- Okay.
- All right, so how about mom

14:21.444 --> 14:23.044
does some cooking tonight and you watch?

14:23.112 --> 14:24.443
- Yeah!
- You like that?

14:24.530 --> 14:26.191
- Yup!
- All right.

14:28.576 --> 14:30.441
See what we got!

14:41.547 --> 14:42.547
Thank you.

14:54.644 --> 14:57.056
- Yeah.
- So I sent b.J. To Rick's place.

14:58.064 --> 15:00.646
It was covered in feds.

15:00.733 --> 15:01.848
All right, get lost.

15:01.943 --> 15:04.309
I'm just worried
they're gonna find something.

15:06.322 --> 15:08.404
You forget who you're talking to?

15:08.491 --> 15:11.483
I've got a long reach. Stop worrying.

15:11.577 --> 15:13.533
All right. You're the boss.

15:15.748 --> 15:16.783
Son of a bitch.

15:19.794 --> 15:22.160
Jj

15:39.564 --> 15:41.555
Vicky!

15:44.527 --> 15:45.937
Vicky?

15:47.738 --> 15:49.603
Can we talk for a minute?

15:49.699 --> 15:51.690
Yeah, of course.

15:53.119 --> 15:54.529
I'll be right back, okay?

16:06.966 --> 16:08.706
What's going on?

16:12.180 --> 16:13.420
Tell me.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.547
Did you get bad news?

16:16.642 --> 16:17.802
Yeah.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.393
Let me help you.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.268
Damon... I hope you realize

16:25.359 --> 16:28.476
how appreciative we are
of everything you've done for us.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.105
Truly. Thank you.

16:33.451 --> 16:36.909
Unfortunately, this is just one thing
you can't help us with.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.702
Yes, I can.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.407
It's bad.

16:43.586 --> 16:46.077
And no one even knows
for sure what it really is.

16:46.172 --> 16:49.915
It's just test after test
and doctor after doctor.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.125
We'll figure it out.

16:52.220 --> 16:53.835
Together.

16:55.515 --> 16:58.006
You know that she's the first thing
that I ever did right?

16:59.018 --> 17:00.849
And she's perfect!

17:03.564 --> 17:04.804
It's just unfair.

17:06.943 --> 17:08.148
No, it isn't.

17:11.071 --> 17:12.858
Sometimes I wonder if...

17:12.949 --> 17:17.157
God is just punishing me for all the
terrible things that I've done in my life.

17:17.244 --> 17:19.452
It's not a nice feeling.

17:19.539 --> 17:22.155
I don't think god works that way.

17:24.167 --> 17:26.159
Maybe not, but...

17:28.172 --> 17:29.662
If he did, I just...

17:31.467 --> 17:33.003
I wish he would make me suffer.

17:34.470 --> 17:36.256
That, I could handle.

17:36.347 --> 17:38.338
That would actually make sense.

17:40.518 --> 17:42.224
But not her.

17:42.311 --> 17:44.051
Let me pay for it.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.441
You two are about all I have left.

17:50.528 --> 17:51.813
Damon...

17:55.992 --> 17:57.983
I would need something in return.

17:59.036 --> 18:00.822
Of course!

18:00.913 --> 18:03.199
Damon, I would do anything
for you, regardless.

18:03.291 --> 18:05.077
Just name it.

18:08.337 --> 18:10.202
It would involve...

18:11.674 --> 18:13.585
Using some of your old skills.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.590
I need you tonight.

18:20.182 --> 18:22.673
Five stops. Five pickups.

18:22.768 --> 18:23.883
Pickups?

18:23.978 --> 18:25.764
What kind of pickups?

18:25.855 --> 18:28.562
Money. Lots of it.

18:31.527 --> 18:34.018
I don't think I understand
where this conversation is going.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.353
You don't?

18:36.532 --> 18:37.863
Or you don't want to?

18:39.118 --> 18:40.449
Oh, come on!

18:40.536 --> 18:41.867
You didn't think for one minute

18:41.954 --> 18:46.038
that I got all of this from my injury.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.116
I never questioned it.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.702
You never wanted to.

18:52.006 --> 18:54.873
I'm sure you heard things about me.

18:55.885 --> 18:57.091
Of course!

18:57.178 --> 19:00.716
But the difference is, I know you,
so I never believed any of it.

19:00.806 --> 19:02.137
Believe it.

19:03.476 --> 19:04.511
All of it.

19:05.770 --> 19:07.806
Jj

19:07.897 --> 19:11.515
You are the only person I know

19:11.609 --> 19:13.770
I can completely trust.

19:13.861 --> 19:15.021
I need you to stop.

19:16.322 --> 19:19.314
I can't even be having this conversation.

19:20.743 --> 19:23.075
I can't do that for you.

19:23.162 --> 19:26.905
I will take care of you and Lily.

19:26.999 --> 19:30.992
I made myself a promise
that I would never do this again.

19:32.004 --> 19:34.791
I don't see that you have much choice.

19:34.882 --> 19:37.999
You're right, I don't have a choice.

19:38.094 --> 19:42.554
I have Lily, and it is
not safe for me out there.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.409
There are too many people
that are waiting for me

19:44.433 --> 19:46.594
to make this exact mistake.

19:47.603 --> 19:49.639
I'll find another way.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.846
Because if something
were to happen to me...

19:51.941 --> 19:53.522
See that it doesn't.

19:55.820 --> 19:59.563
Victoria, I know I needn't remind you

19:59.657 --> 20:02.615
that you have your daughter
because of me.

20:04.495 --> 20:06.736
You would be in jail,

20:06.831 --> 20:08.992
she would be in a state facility.

20:12.878 --> 20:15.585
Take a minute. Think about it.

20:15.673 --> 20:18.665
Jj

20:32.773 --> 20:34.855
Of all the nights for this to happen...

20:35.860 --> 20:37.145
Maybe we dodged a bullet.

20:39.071 --> 20:42.154
This money goes all the way
to the governor tonight.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.447
And if she got implicated...

20:43.534 --> 20:44.854
Oh, lord, don't go there!

20:46.537 --> 20:48.297
You know, you may be right.

20:49.665 --> 20:52.498
Hell, we may all get lucky.

20:59.884 --> 21:01.795
Well?

21:01.886 --> 21:03.968
I can't.

21:04.054 --> 21:05.590
I have a daughter now.

21:07.892 --> 21:10.679
Oh, and Damon?
Cook your own damn dinner.

21:11.687 --> 21:12.722
Lily!

21:13.731 --> 21:15.596
Lillian?

21:15.691 --> 21:18.683
Jj

21:27.286 --> 21:28.446
Where is she?

21:31.123 --> 21:32.613
Where is she?

21:32.708 --> 21:34.323
She's safe.

21:34.418 --> 21:35.908
I will cut out your heart.

21:37.004 --> 21:39.211
Now, Vicky.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.914
There's no need for any of this.

21:43.719 --> 21:44.719
See?

21:46.555 --> 21:48.420
Now think about it.

21:48.516 --> 21:51.553
If you kill me,
you'll never be able to find her.

21:52.812 --> 21:55.394
You do what I tell you to do,

21:55.481 --> 21:57.767
and everything will be just fine.

21:57.858 --> 22:00.440
I promise.

22:00.528 --> 22:02.109
Well...

22:06.325 --> 22:08.156
Good.

22:08.244 --> 22:11.031
Let's get you suited up, shall we?

22:11.121 --> 22:14.113
Jj

22:18.629 --> 22:20.165
Help yourself.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.767
There's a bodycam there. Take it.

22:35.855 --> 22:38.346
And there's a camera on your helmet.

22:39.733 --> 22:43.317
I'll give you each stop, one at a time.

22:44.321 --> 22:46.983
You bring the money back,
I give you the next stop.

22:47.074 --> 22:49.065
That's how it goes. Okay?

22:52.580 --> 22:53.820
Okay.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.990
Just in case it wasn't clear...

22:58.085 --> 23:01.122
When this is over, so are we.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.204
I know.

23:06.051 --> 23:08.042
Jj

23:16.520 --> 23:19.512
Jj

23:31.035 --> 23:34.903
All right, your first stop
is 751 Keller St.

23:34.997 --> 23:36.658
German night club.

23:36.749 --> 23:38.029
Do you speak German?

23:39.043 --> 23:43.377
A little bit. My German
isn't perfect but I understand everything.

23:43.464 --> 23:45.580
I'm sure you'll get by.

23:45.674 --> 23:48.256
Jj

23:56.435 --> 23:58.551
Evening, detectives.

23:58.646 --> 24:00.386
B.j.

24:05.152 --> 24:08.861
So you're telling me that Rick's place
was covered in feds.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.984
- Yeah.
- You know one of them?

24:11.075 --> 24:14.363
- Yes, I do.
- Which one?

24:14.453 --> 24:16.284
The one running the show.

24:17.456 --> 24:18.456
And?

24:19.500 --> 24:22.207
And what? Will he play ball?

24:22.294 --> 24:24.000
I don't know.

24:24.088 --> 24:27.376
Maybe. Maybe not.

24:27.466 --> 24:28.797
You're so helpful.

24:28.884 --> 24:30.340
I can't speak for him, can I?

24:30.427 --> 24:32.292
Listen, Damon ain't worried.

24:32.388 --> 24:33.423
He never worries.

24:34.598 --> 24:36.660
It only takes one fuckin' boy scout
to take down that enterprise.

24:36.684 --> 24:38.174
That can't happen.

24:38.268 --> 24:41.351
They won't allow it.
Too many people'd get hurt.

24:41.438 --> 24:43.724
Use your head!

24:43.816 --> 24:46.523
So you're telling me
that you know one of these guys.

24:46.610 --> 24:47.610
Yeah.

24:48.904 --> 24:50.485
If you want, I can talk to him for you.

24:52.116 --> 24:53.572
I want him on our team.

24:56.328 --> 24:57.909
All right.

24:59.498 --> 25:02.490
Jj

25:07.923 --> 25:12.292
I made myself a promise
that I would never do this again.

25:12.386 --> 25:14.217
Mom?

25:14.304 --> 25:17.467
I don't see
that you have much choice.

25:20.144 --> 25:23.636
Five stops. Five pickups.

25:23.731 --> 25:25.000
What kind of pickups?

25:25.024 --> 25:27.515
Money. Lots of it.

25:27.609 --> 25:29.019
Mom?

25:30.946 --> 25:32.231
Help me!

25:33.240 --> 25:37.859
Kill me,
and you'll never be able to find her.

25:37.953 --> 25:40.410
You do what I tell you to do...

25:40.497 --> 25:44.035
And everything will be just fine.
I promise.

25:45.419 --> 25:47.705
I'll cut out your heart.

25:47.796 --> 25:50.788
Jj

25:53.594 --> 25:56.427
When this is over, so are we.

25:59.641 --> 26:01.097
I know.

26:07.608 --> 26:10.600
Jj

26:43.811 --> 26:46.393
Turn your helmet
so that it faces the door.

26:46.480 --> 26:48.812
Let's keep everybody honest.

26:48.899 --> 26:50.890
Jj

26:52.319 --> 26:53.980
Did you have trouble here?

26:54.071 --> 26:55.686
There's trouble everywhere.

26:55.781 --> 26:58.272
Rival gangs, sticky fingers...

26:58.367 --> 26:59.527
Plus you're a woman.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.825
Ha. Funny.

27:03.747 --> 27:05.988
All right. What do I say?

27:06.083 --> 27:07.869
You're there to see Erik.

27:13.841 --> 27:15.422
Frik.

27:15.509 --> 27:18.717
- What about him?
- Don't waste my fucking time.

27:20.305 --> 27:23.297
Jj

28:01.805 --> 28:05.389
For me, there should be a little
less of that dress. Ja?

28:07.186 --> 28:09.677
That'll cost you

28:09.771 --> 28:11.727
okay.

28:12.733 --> 28:15.270
Meet Damon's new errand boy!

28:16.278 --> 28:18.860
Girl, asshole!

28:25.287 --> 28:26.287
Everything.

28:47.392 --> 28:50.384
Jj

29:01.615 --> 29:03.071
I know you.

29:09.998 --> 29:11.363
Your brother.

29:13.919 --> 29:16.080
Yes, and what?

29:17.089 --> 29:21.549
You used to have long flowing locks
of Chestnut hair.

29:26.390 --> 29:27.390
Didn't you?

29:32.104 --> 29:33.594
What the hell was that?

29:41.780 --> 29:43.816
Answer me! What the hell was that?

29:57.004 --> 29:59.211
Get me out of here, please!

30:00.215 --> 30:01.625
Uh...

30:01.717 --> 30:03.673
- Tell me there's a back way out.
- No.

30:03.760 --> 30:04.795
The doors are chained.

30:04.886 --> 30:06.296
What the hell are you doing?

30:06.388 --> 30:07.503
That was worth a try.

30:08.515 --> 30:09.515
You ready?

30:10.642 --> 30:11.802
I et's do this.

30:17.190 --> 30:19.168
We're just gonna go out there
and act like we're talking.

30:19.192 --> 30:20.477
- Okay?
- Yeah.

30:20.569 --> 30:23.356
You know what? Can you pretend
that I'm really funny?

30:23.447 --> 30:25.688
- I'm a prostitute.
- Touché.

30:25.782 --> 30:29.570
And I'm gonna get you to carry this
just in case I need both my hands.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.526
- You ready? Let's do it.
- Mm.

30:38.211 --> 30:40.327
Jj

31:00.108 --> 31:03.100
Jj

31:16.208 --> 31:18.119
Shit... Max!

31:35.394 --> 31:38.056
- Hello.
- Who is this crazy bitch

31:38.146 --> 31:40.762
shooting up my cousin's club?

31:40.857 --> 31:44.099
- A late replacement.
- I'll kill her.

31:44.194 --> 31:46.310
Calm down.

31:46.405 --> 31:48.521
My cousin is dead!

31:48.615 --> 31:49.900
Condolences.

31:49.991 --> 31:52.277
Are you making a joke?

31:52.369 --> 31:54.610
No, no, not at all.

31:54.704 --> 31:57.912
But it seems that the club
now belongs to you.

32:02.337 --> 32:03.622
Who is she?

32:06.258 --> 32:07.998
You know who she is.

32:10.137 --> 32:12.378
The deal was,

32:12.472 --> 32:16.385
no harm comes to her
as long as you keep her in her cage.

32:18.728 --> 32:20.059
She got out.

32:20.147 --> 32:23.935
Well, then it's open season!

32:24.025 --> 32:25.856
Just stay out of her way.

32:27.154 --> 32:30.567
You know I'm not the only one
that would like to see her dead.

32:30.657 --> 32:32.443
Yeah...

32:32.534 --> 32:36.072
A long, undistinguished list.

32:38.290 --> 32:41.282
Jj

32:51.761 --> 32:55.470
Let me help you. Please.

32:57.476 --> 32:59.012
Yeah.

33:02.063 --> 33:05.055
Jj

33:43.021 --> 33:46.809
Don't make this more complicated
than it needs to be.

33:46.900 --> 33:50.438
What can I say? She needed help.

33:50.529 --> 33:53.236
This is no time for personal wars,
Victoria.

33:53.323 --> 33:56.941
Wow! That is rich coming from you.

33:57.035 --> 33:59.447
Let's not forget
who made this personal, hmm?

34:00.455 --> 34:02.662
He said he knew you. How?

34:02.749 --> 34:04.705
What's it to you, anyway?

34:04.793 --> 34:07.785
Well, they're gonna
be out all night looking for you.

34:07.879 --> 34:09.619
Sooner or later, they'll come here.

34:09.714 --> 34:12.080
Pity!

34:12.175 --> 34:14.291
How does he know you?

34:16.221 --> 34:17.822
That's what happens
when you put me in a room

34:17.847 --> 34:20.179
with the piece of shit
that killed my brother. We good?

34:23.311 --> 34:26.268
1000 east end.

34:35.907 --> 34:38.899
Jj

35:30.170 --> 35:33.162
Jj

35:43.558 --> 35:44.968
That's the place.

35:47.145 --> 35:48.760
Be careful in there.

35:49.773 --> 35:52.765
Jj

35:58.573 --> 36:01.235
What the hell is this place?

36:01.326 --> 36:04.989
It's like a bad dream, isn't it?

36:05.080 --> 36:06.820
This whole thing is like a bad dream.

37:07.434 --> 37:09.425
Jj

37:33.168 --> 37:36.160
Jj

37:53.480 --> 37:57.143
You're running a little... late.

38:22.300 --> 38:23.790
Seriously?

38:40.151 --> 38:42.392
Jj

38:48.827 --> 38:50.158
They're stalling.

38:51.996 --> 38:54.783
Something's not right.

38:56.167 --> 38:58.158
- Get out of there.
- Ahem.

38:58.253 --> 38:59.333
Gget out of there.

39:07.303 --> 39:09.214
All right, time's up.

39:09.305 --> 39:10.590
Stop the machine.

39:19.399 --> 39:22.983
Hm. Stop the fucking machines.
Fill the bag.

39:23.069 --> 39:25.731
Hey... baby...

39:25.822 --> 39:27.778
It's cool.

39:28.783 --> 39:30.523
All right, this creepy ass
place you have?

39:30.618 --> 39:31.858
It makes me hauseous.

39:31.953 --> 39:33.739
And so does your calling me "baby."

39:36.207 --> 39:37.788
Now fill the bag.

39:45.550 --> 39:47.040
What's your boy's name?

39:47.135 --> 39:48.545
The one with the Jenny Craig.

39:53.391 --> 39:55.177
Billy smalls.

39:56.519 --> 39:57.679
Wait, really?

39:58.688 --> 40:00.053
Mr. smalls?

40:01.524 --> 40:03.043
You gotta admit, it kind of lends itself

40:03.067 --> 40:04.853
to, like, a dozen inappropriate jokes.

40:04.944 --> 40:07.026
Am I right, fellas? Huh?

40:13.286 --> 40:14.776
All right, it's a tough crowd.

40:14.871 --> 40:15.991
You win some, you lose some.

40:16.080 --> 40:18.036
Get the fuck up.

40:25.214 --> 40:27.079
Can he go any slower?

40:27.175 --> 40:29.131
Because if he can,
I will have to kill him.

40:42.899 --> 40:44.264
It's not personal.

40:47.820 --> 40:49.401
Fill the bag.

40:53.660 --> 40:55.025
Do it.

40:58.164 --> 40:59.574
Do it!

41:10.176 --> 41:11.837
Now zip it up.

41:15.765 --> 41:18.131
Be a gentleman and hand it to Mr. smalls.

41:18.226 --> 41:21.218
Jj

41:24.691 --> 41:25.691
He's got a gun.

41:26.567 --> 41:28.808
Oh, I wouldn't do that.

41:28.903 --> 41:30.234
I'm a really good shot

41:30.321 --> 41:32.983
and, uh, your boy here is a...
He's a pretty big target.

41:33.992 --> 41:35.027
Hey, it's cool.

41:36.035 --> 41:38.321
No one here needs to die.

41:38.413 --> 41:40.950
Yeah. We agree on something.

41:41.040 --> 41:42.905
Pleasure, boys.

41:50.425 --> 41:51.756
Vic...

41:53.803 --> 41:54.883
Victoria...

41:56.514 --> 41:59.005
It looks like this is your stop.
Hand me the bag.

41:59.100 --> 42:02.092
Jj

42:15.074 --> 42:16.234
Vicky...

42:19.912 --> 42:21.072
Fuck.

42:23.708 --> 42:25.494
So, we meet again.

42:28.421 --> 42:30.412
I don't know whether I should kill you...

42:32.550 --> 42:33.756
Or hire you.

42:39.182 --> 42:41.514
This is Damon's money.

42:50.359 --> 42:51.644
Hello, Damon!

42:53.780 --> 42:55.691
Damon!

42:58.409 --> 42:59.689
Hey, buddy.

43:01.162 --> 43:02.368
Ready for my closeup.

43:04.540 --> 43:05.700
As fun as that was to watch,

43:05.792 --> 43:07.999
you, uh, might want me
to turn it on first.

43:11.464 --> 43:13.580
Hello, Damon!

43:13.674 --> 43:16.086
I'm ready for my closeup!

43:23.392 --> 43:25.132
Get out of there.

43:25.228 --> 43:26.638
Get out of there!

43:29.065 --> 43:30.065
Victoria?

43:32.777 --> 43:33.777
Vicky?

43:43.746 --> 43:45.907
Jj

43:49.961 --> 43:51.121
Can you hear me now?

43:51.212 --> 43:53.043
These German fuckers are after me.

43:54.340 --> 43:55.204
I isten to me.

43:55.299 --> 43:56.835
You're good. You're good.

44:01.722 --> 44:02.962
Make a left here!

44:07.478 --> 44:08.718
One is gone.

44:08.813 --> 44:10.223
Left, left.

44:11.524 --> 44:13.515
Jj

44:22.368 --> 44:24.199
Up ahead, hard right, hard right.

44:27.331 --> 44:28.946
Cut her off!

44:31.627 --> 44:34.619
Jj

44:45.975 --> 44:46.975
Take a left.

45:07.121 --> 45:08.611
Hello?

45:08.706 --> 45:10.242
What's going on out there?

45:10.333 --> 45:12.574
You know
what's going on out there.

45:13.669 --> 45:15.955
I know she took out Erik and his crew.

45:16.047 --> 45:19.084
Well, it turns out
that he killed her brother.

45:19.175 --> 45:20.631
And you didn't know that?

45:20.718 --> 45:23.801
Well, I wasn't as sure as I am now.

45:24.889 --> 45:25.889
Well...

45:26.933 --> 45:28.969
I think these federal agents
are wanting to meet.

45:29.060 --> 45:32.928
Told you, everybody has a price.

45:33.022 --> 45:34.978
She done made another mess
on the east side.

45:36.317 --> 45:38.808
Now that was Max. He controls them.

45:38.903 --> 45:41.269
He must have called ahead.

45:41.364 --> 45:43.855
Well, tell your girl no more fireworks.

45:43.950 --> 45:45.736
Tell Max to butt out.

45:45.826 --> 45:48.693
Like he gonna listen to me?

45:48.788 --> 45:49.994
Make him.

45:57.755 --> 45:59.746
Jj

46:25.741 --> 46:27.151
Hey, it's me again.

46:27.243 --> 46:28.595
I just got off the phone with Damon.

46:28.619 --> 46:30.109
You've got to let her go.

46:30.204 --> 46:33.446
No! I'm gonna kill this bitch right now.

46:33.541 --> 46:36.283
Jj

46:45.136 --> 46:47.172
You need to get yourself turned around.

46:51.225 --> 46:53.216
Jj

47:12.121 --> 47:14.112
Jj

47:18.419 --> 47:19.454
You're trapped.

47:40.649 --> 47:41.649
Fuck.

48:10.805 --> 48:13.296
Get the truck and block the exit.

48:22.900 --> 48:23.900
Okay, up ahead.

48:26.821 --> 48:28.812
Jj

48:37.206 --> 48:39.071
All right, the exit's just ahead.

48:40.793 --> 48:43.785
Jj

48:49.427 --> 48:50.507
Shit.

49:10.531 --> 49:12.146
Oh, shit.

49:23.878 --> 49:24.878
No!

49:33.179 --> 49:34.179
All right.

49:38.893 --> 49:41.885
Jj

50:15.221 --> 50:17.212
Jj

50:21.393 --> 50:23.054
How do you feel?

50:26.607 --> 50:28.188
I'm tired.

50:29.193 --> 50:31.354
I'm always tired.

50:32.655 --> 50:34.065
Me too.

50:35.741 --> 50:39.279
Well, your mother will be back soon.

50:40.996 --> 50:42.486
Get some sleep.

50:47.920 --> 50:50.912
Jj

51:04.270 --> 51:05.806
My, my, my.

51:06.814 --> 51:08.475
That was quite a show.

51:10.859 --> 51:12.724
Where's Lily?

51:12.820 --> 51:14.060
Still safe.

51:15.906 --> 51:17.442
I need to know where she is.

51:17.533 --> 51:19.023
You've got three more stops.

51:20.035 --> 51:21.696
Fuck this!

51:21.787 --> 51:23.277
Just tell me where she is.

51:23.372 --> 51:25.738
Three more stops.

51:25.833 --> 51:28.061
I can't believe that I actually thought
for the first time in my life

51:28.085 --> 51:29.871
that someone gave a damn about us.

51:29.962 --> 51:33.250
So if you're not going to tell me
where she is, then tell me why.

51:33.340 --> 51:35.001
Why, Damon?

51:35.092 --> 51:37.583
You ran drugs for the Russians.

51:37.678 --> 51:40.761
You were a courier in and out of Moscow.

51:41.765 --> 51:45.508
You and your brother are suspected
of even more, including murder.

51:47.479 --> 51:49.765
So stop with the babe
in the woods routine, okay?

51:50.941 --> 51:53.148
You've got three more stops.

51:53.235 --> 51:55.226
Why did I have you on a pedestal?

51:56.947 --> 51:58.528
Three more stops.

52:00.075 --> 52:03.442
America's police commissioner. Wow.

52:06.248 --> 52:08.455
Three. More. Stops.

52:11.378 --> 52:13.039
If anything happens to her,

52:13.130 --> 52:16.088
if there's a single scratch on her body,
I swear to god...

52:31.273 --> 52:34.265
Jj

53:16.860 --> 53:18.771
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

53:18.862 --> 53:21.194
Is this a crooked cop convention?

53:23.575 --> 53:26.362
Oof!

53:26.453 --> 53:28.193
So how much we talking about here?

53:31.542 --> 53:33.533
That would depend on what's on them tapes.

53:34.837 --> 53:36.623
Well, they're not good.

53:36.714 --> 53:39.205
Big mess for everyone involved.

53:39.299 --> 53:41.130
Even the little we've heard.

53:42.845 --> 53:44.210
Oh, yeah?

53:45.305 --> 53:48.092
So what have you heard?
How detailed is it?

53:52.229 --> 53:54.595
I would say that they are detailed enough.

53:55.649 --> 53:57.310
You got names?

53:58.819 --> 54:01.686
Oh, we certainly do, detective kehoe.

54:01.780 --> 54:03.862
The problem is, is that, uh,

54:03.949 --> 54:05.940
he wasn't just wearing a wire.

54:07.286 --> 54:08.901
He was taping phone calls.

54:10.414 --> 54:13.747
Phone calls and wires
going back two years.

54:13.834 --> 54:15.665
We're talking the governor on down.

54:17.880 --> 54:20.087
- And?
- And?

54:21.925 --> 54:25.088
Well, "and" is that I just don't know.

54:26.263 --> 54:29.596
I mean, this could be
the biggest case of my career, man.

54:29.683 --> 54:32.595
Cush job in Washington.

54:32.686 --> 54:34.972
A talking head on t.V., I mean...

54:36.148 --> 54:37.763
Just look at this face, huh?

54:39.693 --> 54:41.399
I belong on television, don't I?

54:45.115 --> 54:47.197
Yeah. I suppose.

54:47.284 --> 54:48.740
Well, ahem...

54:50.621 --> 54:52.737
Taking that into consideration...

54:54.291 --> 54:58.500
The deal that we might strike would have
to make a whole hell lot of sense.

55:02.466 --> 55:04.457
Jj

55:05.511 --> 55:07.342
Oh, it makes sense.

55:14.561 --> 55:16.802
I'm gonna make a call.

55:16.897 --> 55:18.888
Jj

55:53.267 --> 55:56.259
Jj

56:32.014 --> 56:34.005
What kind of a priest are you?

56:37.227 --> 56:40.139
I stopped being a priest a long time ago.

56:54.244 --> 56:56.030
Don't go back the way you came.

56:57.039 --> 56:59.826
They're over at your bike.

56:59.917 --> 57:00.997
Be safe.

57:08.425 --> 57:10.837
I know Damon cares about you.

57:12.429 --> 57:14.841
- Bullshit.
- And your daughter.

57:19.019 --> 57:21.010
Jj

57:31.490 --> 57:32.855
Hey, baby.

57:36.078 --> 57:37.659
That was easy.

57:52.344 --> 57:55.336
Jj

58:30.007 --> 58:31.047
This Nazi won't let it go.

58:34.845 --> 58:37.131
Any suggestions, Damon?

58:37.222 --> 58:38.507
Left, two blocks.

58:39.808 --> 58:40.888
There's a back alley.

58:42.436 --> 58:44.427
Now he won't be able to follow you there.

58:55.198 --> 58:56.278
Where the fuck is it?

58:56.366 --> 58:57.606
Take a left!

58:58.660 --> 59:00.070
How many times can I turn left?

59:00.162 --> 59:01.777
As many times as needed.

59:01.872 --> 59:03.863
Jj

59:05.459 --> 59:06.869
I'm gonna be back at square one.

59:06.960 --> 59:08.075
Left, left.

59:08.170 --> 59:10.252
Fuck you and your left.

59:10.338 --> 59:12.329
Jj

59:29.316 --> 59:31.352
Nicely done.

59:35.405 --> 59:36.736
Fucking shit!

59:46.333 --> 59:49.325
Jj

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:17.613
Hey!

01:00:21.868 --> 01:00:23.859
Who the hell is this guy?

01:00:23.954 --> 01:00:25.740
What does it matter?

01:00:32.254 --> 01:00:33.664
He's a cop.

01:00:33.755 --> 01:00:35.040
Dirty cop.

01:00:37.467 --> 01:00:39.423
Is there any other kind in this city?

01:00:39.511 --> 01:00:42.344
He was particularly bad.

01:00:44.266 --> 01:00:46.552
Well, what the fuck are you?

01:00:46.643 --> 01:00:48.554
Again, what does it matter?

01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:51.762
It matters because the only person
that's allowed to kill you is me,

01:00:51.857 --> 01:00:53.643
after I get my daughter back.

01:00:53.733 --> 01:00:55.018
It's none of your concern.

01:00:55.110 --> 01:00:57.601
Everything is my concern.

01:00:57.696 --> 01:00:59.232
You've got two more stops.

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:02.481
All right, I can play this game.

01:01:03.743 --> 01:01:05.199
Hmm.

01:01:05.287 --> 01:01:08.074
I put money on him being your partner.

01:01:08.165 --> 01:01:11.657
So there's only two options...
Greed or double-cross.

01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:14.500
Which one was it?

01:01:14.588 --> 01:01:16.954
It doesn't concern you.

01:01:17.048 --> 01:01:18.458
I need to get my daughter back!

01:01:20.468 --> 01:01:24.586
He probably thought his youth
and strength would help him.

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:26.922
It's no match
for age and cunning, is it?

01:01:28.935 --> 01:01:32.769
In a couple of hours,
you'll be totally free of all of this.

01:01:32.856 --> 01:01:34.892
Are you insane?

01:01:34.983 --> 01:01:36.519
We will never be free of this!

01:01:36.610 --> 01:01:38.817
You're making damn sure of that!

01:01:38.904 --> 01:01:40.064
Trust me.

01:01:40.155 --> 01:01:42.362
All right?

01:01:42.449 --> 01:01:43.689
Two more stops.

01:01:50.165 --> 01:01:53.407
And get rid of that for me.

01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:02.041
Jj

01:02:09.434 --> 01:02:10.719
Mom!

01:02:22.656 --> 01:02:25.022
Help me!

01:02:29.371 --> 01:02:32.363
Jj

01:03:18.753 --> 01:03:21.244
Well, hot damn!

01:03:22.590 --> 01:03:24.922
You must be the infamous runner du jour.

01:03:26.761 --> 01:03:28.126
How you doin', honey?

01:03:29.723 --> 01:03:31.259
My name is rayo.

01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:33.681
It's not that hard to say-o0. Okay-0?

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.056
Is that Damon?

01:03:38.773 --> 01:03:40.513
Hisies!

01:03:40.608 --> 01:03:42.098
How ya doin', tiger?

01:03:42.193 --> 01:03:45.060
Wish you were here and all that shit.

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:49.318
Well, you've had quite an evening.

01:03:50.327 --> 01:03:53.740
I heard you killed more people
than Quentin Tarantino.

01:03:56.333 --> 01:03:58.039
Fancy a mint julep?

01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:01.626
No.

01:04:01.713 --> 01:04:04.796
Oh, come on. Let your hair down.

01:04:04.883 --> 01:04:08.091
Metaphorically,
'cause you ain't got much there.

01:04:09.679 --> 01:04:13.171
After all that murder and mayhem,

01:04:13.266 --> 01:04:15.598
I mean, you'd think that you'd be parched.

01:04:17.854 --> 01:04:20.561
C'mon, have a little sippy sip.

01:04:20.648 --> 01:04:22.513
Mommy don't like to drink alone.

01:04:24.611 --> 01:04:25.817
Oh, hush.

01:04:27.155 --> 01:04:29.396
What, you don't trust little old me?

01:04:29.491 --> 01:04:31.027
I don't trust anybody.

01:04:32.369 --> 01:04:34.405
But I'll take a water.

01:04:34.496 --> 01:04:37.579
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, I'll take that then.

01:04:37.665 --> 01:04:38.871
Cheers.

01:04:41.252 --> 01:04:42.833
Keep an eye on him.

01:04:42.921 --> 01:04:44.457
He's a snake.

01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:46.128
These are my boys.

01:04:48.635 --> 01:04:53.550
This is boy cock, man cock, robo cock.

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:56.928
Money!

01:04:57.018 --> 01:04:59.725
Oh, boys, not that you ain't money,

01:04:59.813 --> 01:05:01.599
but you ain't.

01:05:03.733 --> 01:05:05.269
Ah, boys, hello.

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:07.316
This here, is miss...

01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:09.861
I'm not here to socialize. Ahem.

01:05:09.948 --> 01:05:11.654
I'm here to get this.

01:05:12.659 --> 01:05:13.990
Okay.

01:05:14.077 --> 01:05:16.443
You are strong.

01:05:16.538 --> 01:05:18.494
You are strong...

01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:19.912
You are strong...

01:05:21.167 --> 01:05:22.828
- Shit.
- You should be.

01:05:22.919 --> 01:05:27.083
- You are strong...
- Kicking in right about...

01:05:27.173 --> 01:05:28.913
- Kicking in...
- Now...

01:05:29.008 --> 01:05:30.873
- You're strong...
- Right about...

01:05:35.265 --> 01:05:37.176
Vicky?

01:05:37.267 --> 01:05:40.350
Vicky?

01:05:40.437 --> 01:05:43.804
I told you!
It was the best in town.

01:05:43.898 --> 01:05:47.061
Vicky, don't pass out.

01:05:47.152 --> 01:05:50.235
Stay awake. Stay awake.

01:05:50.321 --> 01:05:51.961
- Don't pass out.
- It's the best in town.

01:05:52.031 --> 01:05:53.862
In town...

01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:59.403
I can't believe you don't remember me.

01:05:59.497 --> 01:06:02.284
I knew your brother quite well.

01:06:02.375 --> 01:06:04.912
Don't pass out, Vicky.
Don't pass out.

01:06:05.003 --> 01:06:08.291
He worked for me multiple times
and even ripped me off...

01:06:08.381 --> 01:06:10.918
Rippped me off...

01:06:14.053 --> 01:06:15.964
This was before he worked for Damon.

01:06:16.055 --> 01:06:18.011
Listen to my voice.

01:06:18.099 --> 01:06:19.760
Stay with me.

01:06:19.851 --> 01:06:23.890
Now before you tell me
you don't know anything about this...

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:25.833
- Don't pass out, Vicky.
- I went to your brother's place...

01:06:25.857 --> 01:06:27.768
And you were there.

01:06:27.859 --> 01:06:31.397
I questioned him and questioned him.

01:06:31.488 --> 01:06:33.649
He claimed that he knew
nothing about anything.

01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:35.355
Don't pass out.

01:06:35.450 --> 01:06:37.190
- But you and I both know...
- Stay awake.

01:06:37.285 --> 01:06:39.617
That is bull-fucking-shit.

01:06:39.704 --> 01:06:42.070
Damn it, Vicky, don't... don't pass out.

01:06:42.165 --> 01:06:45.032
My friend had an arms deal...

01:06:45.126 --> 01:06:47.242
A million dollars that I helped broker.

01:06:47.337 --> 01:06:49.231
- Fight it! Fight it, Vicky!
- The last thing I heard from him

01:06:49.255 --> 01:06:53.999
is that he met a beautiful Australian
woman in a bar in Berlin.

01:06:54.093 --> 01:06:55.424
In Berlin.

01:06:55.512 --> 01:06:57.173
Damn it, Vic, don't pass out.

01:06:57.263 --> 01:06:58.543
- Stay with me.
- Sound familiar?

01:06:59.516 --> 01:07:02.303
The description matches you toa t.

01:07:02.393 --> 01:07:03.473
Fight it, Vic.

01:07:03.561 --> 01:07:05.392
I never saw my friend again.

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:08.893
Nor the money.

01:07:08.983 --> 01:07:11.565
Later I learned that that was
what you and brother did.

01:07:11.653 --> 01:07:16.363
You guys stole cash from couriers
that were moving it back and forth.

01:07:16.449 --> 01:07:19.031
You seduced he-rod.

01:07:19.118 --> 01:07:21.484
Imagine how happy I was

01:07:21.579 --> 01:07:23.899
when I heard
you were going to be here tonight.

01:07:25.124 --> 01:07:26.660
Vicky. Vicky.

01:07:26.751 --> 01:07:27.831
The coke.

01:07:28.962 --> 01:07:31.203
The coke!

01:07:31.297 --> 01:07:32.503
Oh, are you trying to talk?

01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:35.832
Ooh, I can't hear you.

01:07:37.971 --> 01:07:39.131
Nol

01:07:39.222 --> 01:07:41.213
jj

01:08:08.042 --> 01:08:09.042
Vicky.

01:08:27.937 --> 01:08:30.349
They say that shit will kill you.

01:09:11.773 --> 01:09:12.888
So?

01:09:15.068 --> 01:09:17.524
You have no idea how lucky you are.

01:09:18.529 --> 01:09:20.770
Okay, why is that?

01:09:20.865 --> 01:09:23.356
Well, the officer that bit it tonight?

01:09:23.451 --> 01:09:26.818
You're lucky you took him out
when you did.

01:09:26.912 --> 01:09:28.153
And, uh...

01:09:29.791 --> 01:09:32.908
You're lucky to have the FBI
as your new partners.

01:09:37.715 --> 01:09:40.502
All right, so what's this gonna cost?

01:09:40.593 --> 01:09:43.710
Well, you know, peace of mind
don't come cheap.

01:09:47.517 --> 01:09:49.178
I didn't think it would.

01:09:50.812 --> 01:09:53.975
They were just about to go to the DEA.

01:09:54.064 --> 01:09:55.305
They?

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:58.938
Homeland security,
the whole nine yards.

01:09:59.028 --> 01:10:01.394
No, no, no, now you said they.
Who's they?

01:10:01.489 --> 01:10:04.652
Well, before we get into that,

01:10:04.742 --> 01:10:07.154
you and I are gonna have
to have an understanding.

01:10:10.623 --> 01:10:12.238
All right, let's talk.

01:10:13.918 --> 01:10:15.158
We want half.

01:10:16.587 --> 01:10:18.498
- Yeah.
- Half?

01:10:18.589 --> 01:10:19.795
He wants half.

01:10:22.719 --> 01:10:24.505
Half the whole operation.

01:10:25.513 --> 01:10:27.504
Jj

01:10:28.641 --> 01:10:29.881
You know what?

01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:35.470
If I was a bettin' man, which I am...

01:10:38.443 --> 01:10:40.434
I'd bet that's not gonna happen.

01:10:45.616 --> 01:10:49.200
Well, if I was you,
I would make it happen.

01:10:50.872 --> 01:10:54.535
If I was you, I'd be worried
about all the scumbags

01:10:54.625 --> 01:10:56.581
that might get their feelings hurt

01:10:56.669 --> 01:10:58.397
when they find out
what you allowed to go down

01:10:58.421 --> 01:11:00.833
right under your goddamn
crooked cop nose.

01:11:08.848 --> 01:11:10.839
Do we have a deal?

01:11:15.897 --> 01:11:17.478
It ain't entirely up to me.

01:11:17.565 --> 01:11:19.226
Well, then, you know,

01:11:19.317 --> 01:11:21.933
I guess I'll just send the tapes on
up the chain, right?

01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:38.537
Time is not your friend, friend.

01:11:57.313 --> 01:11:58.974
Hello.

01:11:59.065 --> 01:12:00.180
Damon?

01:12:01.192 --> 01:12:03.023
That's right.

01:12:04.737 --> 01:12:06.853
What are you doing
answering Childs' phone?

01:12:06.948 --> 01:12:08.188
Well he's dead.

01:12:08.282 --> 01:12:10.022
He's what?!

01:12:11.035 --> 01:12:12.400
Yeah. I shot him.

01:12:13.496 --> 01:12:14.906
And he's dead?

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:18.031
I'm pretty sure.

01:12:19.752 --> 01:12:22.585
You're kidding me! What happened?

01:12:22.672 --> 01:12:24.833
Well, you'd have to ask him.

01:12:25.883 --> 01:12:27.874
So you're not gonna elaborate?

01:12:29.554 --> 01:12:31.010
He came into my home,

01:12:31.097 --> 01:12:34.089
didn't say a word, pulled a gun on me,
so I shot him.

01:12:35.685 --> 01:12:38.176
And you had no idea?

01:12:38.271 --> 01:12:41.354
I'm sure he had a good reason.
We just didn't have time to talk.

01:12:46.362 --> 01:12:49.354
Well, the feds said Rick has a partner.

01:12:49.448 --> 01:12:52.906
Hmm... maybe Childs.

01:12:52.994 --> 01:12:54.734
I never liked him.

01:12:54.829 --> 01:12:56.535
Trusted him even less.

01:12:56.622 --> 01:12:59.238
Okay, well, they want half of everything.

01:13:00.751 --> 01:13:03.208
Well, they could have asked for more.

01:13:04.797 --> 01:13:06.378
And you're good with that?

01:13:07.592 --> 01:13:09.002
You've got my vote.

01:13:13.639 --> 01:13:15.095
Well, okay.

01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:20.263
So I guess everybody
is gonna have to weigh in.

01:13:20.354 --> 01:13:25.314
Hmm. Well, get the tapes, start listening.

01:13:25.401 --> 01:13:27.062
We'll figure it all out.

01:13:51.636 --> 01:13:53.217
Almost done.

01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:55.670
One more stop.

01:13:57.975 --> 01:13:59.511
Where?

01:14:00.519 --> 01:14:02.055
The convention center.

01:14:02.146 --> 01:14:05.434
Marcel gauthier.

01:14:10.154 --> 01:14:11.894
The union boss?

01:14:12.907 --> 01:14:13.817
Hmm.

01:14:13.908 --> 01:14:16.445
You saved the best for last, huh?

01:14:16.535 --> 01:14:19.948
When you get back,
I'll tell you how to find Lillian.

01:14:32.927 --> 01:14:35.919
Jj

01:15:42.913 --> 01:15:45.495
Park and leave your bike there.

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:55.550
Vicky...

01:15:59.555 --> 01:16:01.216
It's been a while, Vicky!

01:16:04.435 --> 01:16:05.550
What's that?

01:16:06.562 --> 01:16:07.562
Cocaine?

01:16:08.397 --> 01:16:10.183
Just arriving from a party.

01:16:11.192 --> 01:16:12.728
Nice.

01:16:12.818 --> 01:16:14.649
Where's the money?

01:16:18.574 --> 01:16:20.064
That's Damon, right?

01:16:23.412 --> 01:16:26.495
The money is in the truck.

01:16:34.215 --> 01:16:36.672
You remember
I speak French. Interesting.

01:16:38.677 --> 01:16:40.557
I actually remember
a lot of things.

01:16:41.305 --> 01:16:42.545
I remember your brother.

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:44.596
He could speak lots of languages,
like you.

01:16:45.601 --> 01:16:47.913
Like he could say
"fuck off" like in, I don't know,

01:16:47.937 --> 01:16:49.393
dozens of languages.

01:16:58.447 --> 01:17:00.062
See where it took him.

01:17:01.075 --> 01:17:02.360
He was a funny guy!

01:17:03.869 --> 01:17:05.450
Very charming.

01:17:05.538 --> 01:17:07.654
Very crooked too.

01:17:10.167 --> 01:17:11.247
You were a good team.

01:17:13.712 --> 01:17:15.668
Eh, you talk too much.

01:17:17.883 --> 01:17:20.295
Do you remember
that delivery in Morocco?

01:17:21.303 --> 01:17:24.511
Yeah, you know, I don't remember that.

01:17:24.598 --> 01:17:25.963
Really?

01:17:28.644 --> 01:17:31.181
Nope.

01:17:31.272 --> 01:17:32.672
It didn't go too well.

01:17:35.234 --> 01:17:37.771
You know you're only alive
because of your friend, Damon.

01:17:41.782 --> 01:17:44.239
And I'm gonna say that
to the both of you.

01:17:44.326 --> 01:17:45.406
I could kill you right now.

01:17:45.494 --> 01:17:46.734
It's a trap.

01:17:46.829 --> 01:17:48.569
Your remains disappear.

01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:49.995
Get out of there.

01:17:50.082 --> 01:17:51.572
And what could he do about it?

01:17:51.667 --> 01:17:54.704
How much time does he
have left to protect you?

01:17:54.795 --> 01:17:56.251
You and your daughter.

01:18:04.388 --> 01:18:05.428
Get the hell out of there.

01:18:06.682 --> 01:18:09.674
Jj

01:18:12.062 --> 01:18:13.062
(get out.

01:18:22.656 --> 01:18:23.656
Keep going.

01:19:07.159 --> 01:19:10.151
Jj

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.841
You really fucked up my night.

01:19:36.772 --> 01:19:39.764
Jj

01:19:40.776 --> 01:19:42.687
We're good.

01:19:42.778 --> 01:19:43.778
Get up.

01:19:52.788 --> 01:19:54.198
Sit down.

01:19:56.875 --> 01:19:59.241
- Anything else, governor?
- Thanks.

01:20:03.799 --> 01:20:06.791
Jj

01:20:28.991 --> 01:20:31.528
Here, it's just water. Drink it.

01:20:49.553 --> 01:20:53.137
I need to figure out whether you and Damon
are in on this together.

01:20:58.729 --> 01:21:00.765
In on what?

01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:03.347
Well, nearly every enemy
that you've ever had,

01:21:03.442 --> 01:21:05.728
you've managed to eliminate in one night.

01:21:05.819 --> 01:21:09.528
Yeah, well, ahem,
I'm a good at my job and I'm a good shot.

01:21:09.615 --> 01:21:12.231
- What's your... what's your point?
- Come on, Victoria.

01:21:12.326 --> 01:21:14.942
That's not an accident.
That's been designed.

01:21:15.037 --> 01:21:17.028
Ah, designed.

01:21:18.457 --> 01:21:21.369
Clearly, yes, by Damon.

01:21:22.503 --> 01:21:24.118
Why tonight?

01:21:25.422 --> 01:21:27.708
- L-i don't know.
- Bullshit.

01:21:28.717 --> 01:21:31.925
He's never asked for your help before,

01:21:32.012 --> 01:21:35.504
and then tonight, of all nights,
he chooses to clean house?

01:21:36.725 --> 01:21:38.716
What's so special about this evening?

01:21:44.233 --> 01:21:45.710
Do you know that Damon's been recording

01:21:45.734 --> 01:21:47.565
everything with his partners
Rick and Childs?

01:21:48.904 --> 01:21:51.190
No, no, no, no...

01:21:51.281 --> 01:21:54.648
Ahem, that doesn't make any sense
because Childs tr-tried to kill Damon.

01:21:54.743 --> 01:21:56.734
Of course. He got cold feet,

01:21:56.829 --> 01:21:58.820
and tried to come over to our side.

01:21:58.914 --> 01:22:03.032
Damon was planning to turn
the tapes over to the FBI.

01:22:03.127 --> 01:22:05.368
But we've taken care of that.

01:22:05.462 --> 01:22:06.982
And we'll be taking care of Damon too.

01:22:09.133 --> 01:22:12.045
You can't hurt Damon.

01:22:12.136 --> 01:22:15.253
Uh, I'd be more concerned
about myself if I were you.

01:22:15.347 --> 01:22:18.339
I am thinking of myself!

01:22:18.434 --> 01:22:21.676
Look, Damon has my daughter.

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:24.762
And if something happens to him,
I will not know what he did with her.

01:22:26.942 --> 01:22:27.942
Hmm.

01:22:35.909 --> 01:22:38.867
I have a lucrative proposition
to offer you.

01:22:40.456 --> 01:22:43.323
We want you to come over to our side.

01:22:43.417 --> 01:22:46.784
Find out where your daughter is
and then go get rid of Damon.

01:22:48.172 --> 01:22:51.380
We'll also give your daughter
all the medical attention she needs.

01:22:51.467 --> 01:22:55.380
The best doctors in the world.
The ones you can't afford.

01:22:57.181 --> 01:22:59.638
Yeah, we know all about that too.

01:23:02.603 --> 01:23:06.516
This is for you, not Damon.

01:23:06.607 --> 01:23:08.723
He's not gonna be able to spend it
where he's going.

01:23:12.279 --> 01:23:14.486
Take care of us, we'll take care of you.

01:23:18.702 --> 01:23:22.911
I need to know right now.
Are you in or are you out?

01:23:26.001 --> 01:23:27.992
What are you asking me to do?

01:23:30.088 --> 01:23:31.919
I want you to kill the motherfucker.

01:23:34.426 --> 01:23:36.417
Jj

01:23:39.348 --> 01:23:40.348
Shit.

01:23:41.934 --> 01:23:43.390
I'm gonna need a car.

01:23:44.394 --> 01:23:46.555
Oh, and, uh, my... my guns back

01:23:46.647 --> 01:23:49.855
and that sweet whiskey
that you had before.

01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:53.691
Very smart.

01:23:57.741 --> 01:24:00.733
Jj

01:24:15.467 --> 01:24:16.707
So?

01:24:18.303 --> 01:24:20.294
So what, baby boy?

01:24:31.191 --> 01:24:34.183
Jj

01:24:36.071 --> 01:24:37.686
Governor Driscoll?

01:24:41.785 --> 01:24:43.321
Oh, shit!

01:24:50.961 --> 01:24:53.953
Jj

01:25:34.254 --> 01:25:37.246
Jj

01:25:56.943 --> 01:25:59.275
- Hi.
- Hi, mom.

01:25:59.363 --> 01:26:01.695
Get ready, honey, we're leaving.

01:26:08.372 --> 01:26:09.908
They're coming for you.

01:26:09.998 --> 01:26:11.158
Hmm.

01:26:13.126 --> 01:26:14.991
That's the idea.

01:26:18.006 --> 01:26:19.587
This is all behind you now.

01:26:20.592 --> 01:26:24.084
The money is yours. All of it.

01:26:24.179 --> 01:26:25.794
What do you mean?

01:26:30.602 --> 01:26:32.513
You're coming with me.

01:26:32.604 --> 01:26:35.311
No, no, I have to stay here.

01:26:35.399 --> 01:26:37.685
A few loose ends I have to wrap up.

01:26:37.776 --> 01:26:40.939
- I can do that.
- No, no.

01:26:41.029 --> 01:26:42.894
This is something I have to do...

01:26:42.989 --> 01:26:44.945
For myself.

01:26:45.033 --> 01:26:46.318
Why?

01:26:49.329 --> 01:26:51.320
I've had enough.

01:26:52.666 --> 01:26:55.658
Jj

01:27:00.507 --> 01:27:02.338
Now go.

01:27:08.807 --> 01:27:10.638
You have to make her well.

01:27:13.103 --> 01:27:15.094
I liked my plan better.
