WEBVTT

00:01.732 --> 00:02.203
SAM.
AAH!

00:02.203 --> 00:04.705
IS THIS A CARJACKING?
ARE YOU CARJACKING ME?

00:04.705 --> 00:06.137
I'M THE DEVIL.
[SCREAMS]

00:06.137 --> 00:07.178
[GRUNTS]

00:07.178 --> 00:08.039
BEFORE YOU WERE BORN,

00:08.039 --> 00:10.441
YOUR MOM AND I SOLD
YOUR SOUL TO THE DEVIL.

00:10.441 --> 00:11.642
YOU GOING
TO TELL ANDI?

00:11.642 --> 00:12.613
NO. I'M NOT GOING
TO TELL ANDI.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.045
IF SHE KNOWS,
SHE'LL THINK
I'M A FREAK.

00:14.045 --> 00:14.785
SHE'LL NEVER GO OUT
WITH ME.

00:14.785 --> 00:15.786
YOU CAN MAKE HER
GO OUT WITH YOU, DAMIEN.

00:15.786 --> 00:17.048
YOU'RE JUST GOING
TO BRING ESCAPED SOULS

00:17.048 --> 00:19.090
BACK TO HELL.
THAT'S COOL, RIGHT?

00:19.090 --> 00:20.121
Sam: BUT HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO CAPTURE THEM?

00:20.121 --> 00:24.525
Devil: THIS WILL HELP--
A VESSEL HAND-CRAFTED
IN THE BOWELS OF PERDITION

00:24.525 --> 00:26.026
BY THE INIQUITOUS
AND THE VILE.

00:26.026 --> 00:28.659
THAT WILL WORK.
WORD OF CAUTION--

00:28.659 --> 00:29.760
I DON'T ACCEPT FAILURE.

00:29.760 --> 00:32.403
Sock: YOU FINALLY FOUND
THE ONE THING THAT
YOU'RE GOOD AT.

00:32.403 --> 00:36.307
YOU SENT AN ESCAPED SOUL
BACK TO HELL.

00:39.670 --> 00:41.041
CADY. HEY, IT'S ME.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.274
UM, I HAVEN'T TALKED TO YOU
SINCE YOU LEFT.

00:43.274 --> 00:45.816
I HOPE EVERYTHING'S OK.
UM...

00:45.816 --> 00:47.578
GIVE ME A CALL
WHEN YOU GET THIS.

00:47.578 --> 00:50.081
ALL RIGHT. BYE-BYE.

00:50.081 --> 00:51.622
ARE--
ARE WE REALLY GOING
TO DISCUSS THIS?

00:51.622 --> 00:56.157
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY,
BENJI, WE ARE LIVING
NEXT DOOR TO 2 DEMONS.

00:56.157 --> 00:59.130
DEMONS. ALL RIGHT.
AS CUDDLY AND CUTE
AS THEY ARE,

00:59.130 --> 01:00.331
I CANNOT LIVE
IN THE SAME BUILDING

01:00.331 --> 01:03.094
WITH 2 CAT-EATING,
HORNY FREAKS, ALL RIGHT?

01:03.094 --> 01:05.236
WE'RE MOVING OUT ASAP.
MOVING OUT WHERE?

01:05.236 --> 01:08.269
OK, YOUR MOM
DOESN'T WANT YOU LIVING
IN THE HOUSE ANYMORE,

01:08.269 --> 01:11.342
AND I DON'T HAVE
ANOTHER PLACE LINED UP.

01:11.342 --> 01:12.143
WHAT ABOUT YOU, SAM?

01:12.143 --> 01:15.176
LOOK, I'M THE LAST PERSON
WHO WANTS TO LIVE
NEXT TO DEMONS.

01:15.176 --> 01:15.646
THANK YOU.

01:15.646 --> 01:16.707
BUT WE SIGNED A LEASE
ON THIS CONDO.

01:16.707 --> 01:18.309
WE BREAK IT,
WE DON'T GET
OUR DEPOSIT BACK.

01:18.309 --> 01:20.551
OH, MONEY. MONEY,
SCHMONEY. COME ON.

01:20.551 --> 01:22.253
IF I HAD BEEN WORRIED
ABOUT MONEY
MY WHOLE LIFE,

01:22.253 --> 01:23.414
WHERE DO YOU THINK
I'D BE?

01:23.414 --> 01:25.356
YOU'D NOT BE BROKE,
RIGHT?

01:25.356 --> 01:26.687
THEY DO DO
OUR LAUNDRY, THOUGH.

01:26.687 --> 01:29.220
I LOVE WHEN MY BOXERS
SMELL LIKE LEMONGRASS.

01:29.220 --> 01:31.122
AND THAT
BEER TASTING PARTY
ON SATURDAY?

01:31.122 --> 01:33.394
THAT MAY HAVE BEEN
THE BEST NIGHT
OF MY LIFE.

01:33.394 --> 01:35.826
THEY DEFINITELY AMPED UP
OUR STYLE.

01:35.826 --> 01:37.598
DUDE,
CHECK THIS SWEATER OUT

01:37.598 --> 01:39.670
THAT THEY GOT ME
FOR MY BIRTHDAY.

01:39.670 --> 01:40.731
FOR YOUR--
WHAT?

01:40.731 --> 01:41.832
WHEN WAS
YOUR BIRTHDAY?

01:41.832 --> 01:44.235
MONDAY.
OH. WE TOTALLY SPACED.

01:44.235 --> 01:45.336
WHY DIDN'T YOU
SAY ANYTHING, DUDE?

01:45.336 --> 01:47.578
IT'S FINE.
I MEAN, STEVE AND TONY
TOOK ME OUT

01:47.578 --> 01:51.512
TO THIS
AWESOME BAR CALLED
GEORGE ULTRA LOUNGE.

01:51.512 --> 01:53.544
DUDE, THAT'S A GAY BAR.

01:53.544 --> 01:54.415
[LAUGHS]

01:54.415 --> 01:57.148
OH. YEAH.
THAT EXPLAINS A LOT.

01:57.148 --> 01:59.490
OK. LOOK,
WE'RE GETTING
OFF TOPIC HERE.

01:59.490 --> 02:01.692
YES. STEVE AND TONY
SMELL TERRIFIC,

02:01.692 --> 02:03.894
AND YES, THEY HAVE
GREAT TASTE IN BEER,

02:03.894 --> 02:05.826
BUT THEY ARE DEMONS.

02:05.826 --> 02:07.598
LET'S JUST TRY
TO AVOID THEM.

02:07.598 --> 02:08.359
YEAH. YEAH. YOU KNOW,

02:08.359 --> 02:10.631
LET'S JUST CHILL OUT
THIS RELATIONSHIP,

02:10.631 --> 02:12.563
PUT A LITTLE SEPARATION
BETWEEN US.

02:12.563 --> 02:13.664
ALL RIGHT.
FINE. WHATEVER.

02:13.664 --> 02:16.607
WHAT, IT TAKES 3
OF YOU LADIES TO GET
A STAIN OUT OF MY CHAIR?

02:16.607 --> 02:18.138
IT DOES
IF YOU WANT IT
DONE RIGHT,

02:18.138 --> 02:20.211
WHICH IS
THE ONLY WAY WE KNOW
HOW TO DO IT.

02:20.211 --> 02:20.811
YOU NO LIKEY?

02:20.811 --> 02:22.743
GET OUT ON THE FLOOR
RIGHT NOW, YOU NIMRODS.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.275
YOU'RE DONE IN HERE.
LET'S GO.

02:24.275 --> 02:26.277
HERE YOU GO.
SHE'S READY.

02:26.277 --> 02:28.919
NIMRODS?
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

02:32.183 --> 02:33.184
OOH.

02:33.184 --> 02:34.725
WHOA!

02:34.725 --> 02:35.686
HELLO.

02:35.686 --> 02:36.527
GOOD JOB, SIR.
GOOD JOB.

02:36.527 --> 02:38.489
GOT TED WITH
THE OLD SLIP
AND SLIDE, HUH?

02:38.489 --> 02:40.361
HEY, SAM,
CAN I BORROW YOU
A SECOND?

02:40.361 --> 02:40.831
YEAH, YEAH.

02:40.831 --> 02:42.233
Ted: ENOUGH OF THOSE
SHENANIGANS, GUYS.

02:42.233 --> 02:43.864
THAT'S THE THIRD TIME
THIS WEEK.

02:43.864 --> 02:47.167
SO. SO, WHAT'S UP?

02:47.167 --> 02:47.868
I JUST WANTED
TO APOLOGIZE

02:47.868 --> 02:51.642
FOR WHAT I SAID ABOUT CADY
THE OTHER DAY,
FOR BEING WEIRD.

02:51.642 --> 02:52.903
I WAS TOTALLY
OUT OF LINE.

02:52.903 --> 02:54.845
NO, NO.
IT'S OK. SHE'S...

02:54.845 --> 02:56.747
SHE'S VISITING HER MOM
IN NEW MEXICO.

02:56.747 --> 02:59.179
WE'RE TRYING
TO WORK STUFF OUT.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.611
OH. OK. GOOD.

03:00.611 --> 03:02.883
AND I KNOW
YOU'RE JUST TRYING
TO BE A GOOD FRIEND.

03:02.883 --> 03:05.786
THAT'S THE THING, SAM.

03:05.786 --> 03:07.288
UM...

03:07.288 --> 03:08.719
I WASN'T TRYING
TO BE A GOOD FRIEND.

03:08.719 --> 03:11.492
ACTUALLY,
I WASN'T EVEN BEING
A FRIEND TO YOU AT ALL.

03:11.492 --> 03:13.864
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

03:15.226 --> 03:18.669
I TRIED TO DENY IT
IN THE BEGINNING
BECAUSE I REALLY--

03:18.669 --> 03:20.871
I DON'T WANT TO RUIN
THIS FRIENDSHIP.

03:20.871 --> 03:23.834
AND--GOD.
IT'S KIND OF EMBARRASSING,
BECAUSE IT--

03:23.834 --> 03:26.807
IT TOOK ME SEEING
YOU WITH CADY

03:26.807 --> 03:29.910
FOR ME TO REALIZE
THE TRUTH, AND...

03:29.910 --> 03:31.882
THE THING IS THAT

03:31.882 --> 03:34.845
I SEE YOU AS MORE
THAN A FRIEND.

03:34.845 --> 03:37.217
I LIKE YOU.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.351
I LIKE YOU.

03:44.255 --> 03:46.827
I...I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.699
THERE'S NOTHING TO SAY.

03:48.699 --> 03:49.530
I'M SORRY.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:49.530 --> 03:53.003
I JUST REALLY NEEDED
TO GET THAT OFF MY CHEST.
THAT'S ALL.

03:53.003 --> 03:55.866
IT'S NOTHING.

03:58.269 --> 03:59.870
WHAT?

04:09.420 --> 04:11.852
THIS IS
THE THIRD TEXT
FROM STEVE AND TONY.

04:11.852 --> 04:12.653
OHH.

04:12.653 --> 04:13.584
MAYBE I SHOULD WRITE BACK.

04:13.584 --> 04:15.956
NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT.
STAY STRONG, OK?

04:15.956 --> 04:17.728
YEAH, BUT I MISS
STEVE AND TONY.

04:17.728 --> 04:19.890
I MEAN, THEY'RE LIKE
OUR COOL, FUN UNCLES.

04:19.890 --> 04:23.033
BENJI,
HAVE YOU EVER HAD
A COOL, FUN UNCLE?

04:23.033 --> 04:24.435
UNCLE HECTOR.

04:24.435 --> 04:25.996
UNCLES ARE CREEPY
BY DEFINITION, OK?

04:25.996 --> 04:28.869
HAVE YOU
NOT BEEN WATCHING
YOUR S.V.U. ?

04:28.869 --> 04:31.302
HEY.
HEY.

04:31.302 --> 04:31.972
WHERE YOU BEEN?

04:31.972 --> 04:34.975
UH, I WAS DRIVING AROUND
A BIT.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.777

YEAH, I'M FINE.

04:36.777 --> 04:37.578
AH, HE MISSES CADY.

04:37.578 --> 04:40.311
OH, IS THAT IT?
YOU MISS
YOUR GIRLFRIEND, SAM?

04:40.311 --> 04:41.582
IT'S COOL
TO ADMIT IT, YOU KNOW.

04:41.582 --> 04:44.014
YEAH. REAL MEN SHARE
THEIR FEELINGS, OK?

04:44.014 --> 04:44.915
THAT'S WHAT TONY SAYS.

04:44.915 --> 04:46.887
ACTUALLY, ANDI--
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

04:46.887 --> 04:47.888
NOT IT.

04:54.965 --> 04:56.597

04:56.597 --> 04:58.429
[NO AUDIO]

04:59.370 --> 05:00.401
WE--

05:00.401 --> 05:02.533
HEY, GUYS, WHAT'S UP!

05:02.533 --> 05:03.604
HEY. WE WERE IN
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

05:03.604 --> 05:05.836
WE THOUGHT WE'D STOP BY,
SAY BONJOUR.

05:05.836 --> 05:07.378
BONJOUR!
FRENCH.

05:07.378 --> 05:08.879
IS NOW A BAD TIME?

05:08.879 --> 05:10.711
IS IT A--
WHAT TIME IS IT?

05:10.711 --> 05:12.543
[BOTH TALK AT ONCE]
OH, IT'S--PHEW!

05:12.543 --> 05:14.645
WE MADE SOME APRICOT--
[INDISTINCT] MUFFINS.

05:14.645 --> 05:17.988
YOU BOYS MIGHT LIKE THEM.
THEY'RE DELICIOUS
AND NUTRITIOUS.

05:17.988 --> 05:19.550
HOT STUFF
COMING THROUGH.

05:19.550 --> 05:21.892
OH, YEAH.
GO AHEAD. YEAH.

05:21.892 --> 05:22.893
SO.

05:22.893 --> 05:24.925
HAVEN'T SEEN
YOU GUYS AROUND
IN A WHILE.

05:24.925 --> 05:27.928
[ALL TALK AT ONCE]
[LAUGHTER]

05:27.928 --> 05:28.999
SOMETHING WRONG?

05:28.999 --> 05:31.662
WRONG?
WHAT WOULD BE WRONG?

05:31.662 --> 05:32.933
WELL,
YOU'VE IGNORED
MY TEXTS.

05:32.933 --> 05:33.964
YOU AVOIDED ME
IN THE PARKING LOT,
SAM.

05:33.964 --> 05:36.537
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO DO
SOME YOGA THE OTHER DAY,

05:36.537 --> 05:39.870
BUT I WOUND UP DOING
DOWNWARD-FACING DOG
ALL BY MYSELF.

05:39.870 --> 05:42.072
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT. I FORGOT.

05:42.072 --> 05:43.914
I GUESS WE'RE JUST
A LITTLE CONFUSED

05:43.914 --> 05:46.977
BECAUSE WE THOUGHT
WE'RE HAVING
A GREAT TIME,

05:46.977 --> 05:49.750
THINGS ARE GOING WELL.
AND WHAT HAPPENED?

05:49.750 --> 05:52.383
IS IT SOMETHING WE DID?
SOMETHING WE SAID?

05:52.383 --> 05:54.054
NO. NO.

05:55.756 --> 05:58.859
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
LOOK. UH--

05:58.859 --> 06:00.961
THIS IS TOUGH
FOR ALL OF US, OK?

06:00.961 --> 06:05.035
BUT YOU 2 DESERVE TO
HEAR THIS IN PERSON,
I THINK.

06:05.035 --> 06:07.738
RIGHT NOW,
RIGHT HERE...

06:08.599 --> 06:10.100
FROM SAM.

06:10.901 --> 06:12.102

06:12.102 --> 06:15.045
[SIGHS] UM...

06:15.045 --> 06:16.947
LOOK. STEVE, TONY...

06:16.947 --> 06:19.980
YOU GUYS ARE GREAT GUYS.
THANK YOU, SAM.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.653
IT'S JUST WE'RE--

06:22.653 --> 06:26.016
WE'RE JUST GOING THROUGH
SOME THINGS RIGHT NOW.

06:26.016 --> 06:26.657
YEAH.
WACKO.

06:26.657 --> 06:30.961
WE JUST THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE BEST IF,
FOR RIGHT NOW,

06:30.961 --> 06:34.024
IF WE DIDN'T
HANG OUT AS MUCH.

06:34.024 --> 06:35.065
ARE YOU DUMPING US?

06:35.065 --> 06:37.498
AND IT'S NOT YOU.
IT'S US.

06:37.498 --> 06:38.168
OH, MAN.
IT'S US.

06:38.168 --> 06:43.133
I MEAN, WE NEED TIME
FOR OURSELVES, SPACE,
TO THINK ABOUT THINGS.

06:43.133 --> 06:44.735
THAT WAS A MISTAKE.
OH, GOD.

06:44.735 --> 06:45.606
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

06:45.606 --> 06:46.877
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE
DONE THIS IN PERSON.

06:46.877 --> 06:48.579
WE SHOULD HAVE DONE
THIS OVER THE PHONE

06:48.579 --> 06:49.409
OR TEXT MESSAGING,

06:49.409 --> 06:51.411
SOMETHING LESS
PERSONAL AND BRAVE.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.914
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE'RE LEAVING.

06:54.585 --> 06:56.917
BEFORE
WE DO SOMETHING...

06:57.488 --> 06:59.620
THAT WE REGRET.

07:00.150 --> 07:01.492
SAM.

07:01.492 --> 07:03.023
LIKE WHAT?

07:03.023 --> 07:05.526
COME ON, STEVEN.

07:08.759 --> 07:10.931

07:10.931 --> 07:12.533
SORRY.

07:14.134 --> 07:15.205
OH, MAN.
WOW.

07:15.205 --> 07:16.436
I'M GOING TO BARF.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.708
SOMETHING
WE'LL REGRET?

07:17.708 --> 07:18.809
WHAT THE HELL
DOES THAT MEAN?

07:18.809 --> 07:21.742
THAT MEANS
WE'RE ABOUT THIS CLOSE
TO BECOMING DEMON DINNER.

07:21.742 --> 07:24.074
HEY, YOU GUYS WANT
A SOCK, SAM,
AND BEN MUFFIN?

07:24.074 --> 07:26.847
THEY'RE DELICIOUS
AND NUTRITIOUS.

07:26.847 --> 07:28.879
WE REALLY GOT
TO FIND A NEW PLACE.

07:28.879 --> 07:33.183
I THINK I HEARD
STEVE CRYING THROUGH
THE WALL LAST NIGHT.

07:33.183 --> 07:34.955
NO. NO, YOU DIDN'T.

07:34.955 --> 07:35.956
THAT WAS TONY.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.558
HE'S GOT THAT WEIRD
NASALLY, QUIVERY

07:37.558 --> 07:39.660
STREISAND THING HE DOES

07:39.660 --> 07:40.961
BUT THEY ARE DEMONS,
ALL RIGHT?

07:40.961 --> 07:43.994
I'VE GOT TO STAY STRONG
ON THIS ONE.

07:43.994 --> 07:46.196
I'M NOT GOING
TO BREAK.

07:46.196 --> 07:46.997
IT'S HARD, MAN.

07:46.997 --> 07:48.899
SAMMY, WOULD YOU PLEASE
DO SOMETHING?

07:48.899 --> 07:52.042
OH, DUDE!
[ALL TALK AT ONCE]

07:52.042 --> 07:52.973

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:53.974 --> 07:54.905
SORRY, MAN.

07:54.905 --> 07:56.046

LAST NIGHT.

37:00.389 --> 37:01.390
WELL, GET USED TO IT,
KIDDO.

37:01.390 --> 37:04.693

NO. NOT ANDI.

37:05.924 --> 37:06.925

TO PROTECT HER.

OH, WILL YOU STOP
WITH ALL
THE LOVEY-DOVEY CRAP?

37:09.528 --> 37:12.000
JUST TAKE
WHAT YOU CAN GET
IN LIFE.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.702
LOVE 'EM AND LEAVE 'EM.

37:13.702 --> 37:14.933
NO STRINGS ATTACHED.

37:14.933 --> 37:16.465
SHOULDN'T BE LIKE THAT.

37:16.465 --> 37:17.966
OH, COME ON.
A LIFETIME

37:17.966 --> 37:20.339
OF MEANINGLESS, CHEAP
ONE-NIGHT STANDS

37:20.339 --> 37:20.939
WON'T BE SO BAD.

IN TIME, YOU MAY LEARN
TO ENJOY YOURSELF,

TO ENOUGH IN YOUR LIFETIME,

37:50.299 --> 37:52.371
YOU HAVE A GREATER CHANCE
OF DEVELOPING

37:52.371 --> 37:52.971
COOL MUTANT POWERS.

37:52.971 --> 37:55.874
THING IS, I DON'T
REALLY THINK I WANT
MUTANT POWERS, SOCK.

37:55.874 --> 37:57.906
WELL,
WE'RE JUST GLAD YOU'RE OK.

37:57.906 --> 37:59.778

LAST NIGHT?

38:18.897 --> 38:21.670
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

38:21.670 --> 38:23.031
IT WAS
A CAR ACCIDENT.

38:23.031 --> 38:24.473
NO, NO, NO.

38:24.473 --> 38:26.835
THAT WOMAN,

38:26.835 --> 38:29.578
YOU HAVE
A CONCUSSION.

38:29.578 --> 38:31.940
I KNOW WHAT I SAW.

38:33.011 --> 38:36.815
YOU NEED SOME REST, OK?
I'LL COME BACK LATER.

I ALMOST GOT YOU KILLED.

38:50.829 --> 38:53.001
NO.

LOOK.

38:56.004 --> 38:57.436
THERE'S THINGS THAT...

38:57.436 --> 39:00.439
I WON'T EVER BE ABLE
TO TELL YOU.

39:00.839 --> 39:04.072
LOSING YOU IS A RISK
I'M NOT WILLING TO TAKE.

39:04.072 --> 39:06.945
I'M SORRY.
