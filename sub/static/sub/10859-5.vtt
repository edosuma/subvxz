WEBVTT

00:02.532 --> 00:07.052
Get out of sterling fast. And I want
every barrel of oil you can find.

00:07.052 --> 00:09.132
I don't care what it costs.

00:09.132 --> 00:11.452
It'll be worth twice as much by
lunchtime.

00:13.052 --> 00:16.812
Lloyd, I need that information on the
Price Cooper acquisition.

00:16.812 --> 00:19.212
Go round to my flat. The paperwork's
there somewhere.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:58.572 --> 01:01.492
"Mr Richard, I have the papers."

01:01.492 --> 01:04.852
And can I just say that your new
piece is tremendous?

01:04.852 --> 01:08.132
I haven't acquired anything in
months. I love the light effect.

01:08.132 --> 01:10.932
Can I touch it?
Never touch the investments, Lloyd.

01:10.932 --> 01:13.492
Sorry, sir. I'll have the papers
sent straight over.

01:18.812 --> 01:20.612
Now, that is cool.

01:47.092 --> 01:49.732
Crazy.

02:13.332 --> 02:15.372
Yes, what is it now?

02:15.372 --> 02:17.292
I... Argh!

02:17.292 --> 02:20.052
Come on, man, I haven't got all day.

02:23.532 --> 02:26.692
Lloyd, you're fired!

03:14.932 --> 03:16.732
Morning.

03:28.652 --> 03:29.852
Ahem!

03:30.572 --> 03:32.252
Urgh!

03:32.252 --> 03:35.172
Do you always bring this much stuff
to work? Er...

03:35.172 --> 03:36.612
Yes.

03:36.612 --> 03:39.132
I like to be prepared.

03:39.132 --> 03:41.692
I know some of the creatures can be
frightening,

03:41.692 --> 03:45.092
but surely this many pairs of
underpants is overdoing it?

03:57.012 --> 03:58.972
Nancy, where's Sid gone?

03:58.972 --> 04:02.332
Talk to me.
We have an intruder in Sector Seven.

04:02.332 --> 04:04.292
No identification as yet.

04:04.292 --> 04:06.532
Is it small and ugly in a kind of
cute way?

04:07.412 --> 04:09.412
Just a guess.

04:15.052 --> 04:16.452
Helen?

04:18.411 --> 04:20.372
Prepare to shoot on sight.

04:23.452 --> 04:25.572
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I don't believe it!

04:25.572 --> 04:28.172
You've really got to do something
about your security.

04:39.852 --> 04:41.772
How did you get in?

04:41.772 --> 04:44.812
Jumped the perimeter fence and
kicked in a fire door. It was easy.

04:44.812 --> 04:46.692
What the hell are you doing here?

04:46.692 --> 04:49.252
It's my ambition to fight dinosaurs,
save the world.

04:50.412 --> 04:53.532
Look, I just want to help, that's
all.

04:53.532 --> 04:56.852
I warned you to stay away from this.
I thought you were flirting.

04:56.852 --> 04:59.572
It's hard to read women today.
Can you pistol whip him?

04:59.572 --> 05:01.572
Sir?
Just a thought.

05:01.572 --> 05:04.052
Mr Quinn...
It's um, Danny.

05:04.052 --> 05:06.372
Mr Quinn,

05:06.372 --> 05:10.292
the fate of the nation, possibly the
world, hangs on what we do here.

05:10.292 --> 05:13.932
It's not a place for chancers and
wide boys.

05:13.932 --> 05:16.092
My brother was killed by a creature.

05:17.132 --> 05:19.372
Don't ask me to pretend it didn't
happen.

05:19.372 --> 05:21.572
You've seen what I can do,
and I want in.

05:26.172 --> 05:27.692
Lloyd!

05:34.532 --> 05:36.372
Urgh!

05:44.292 --> 05:46.012
Idiot!

05:52.212 --> 05:55.532
Pollution's getting worse every day,
isn't it, sir? It's the traffic.

05:55.532 --> 05:57.692
Find a shortcut. I can't be late for
my train.

05:57.692 --> 06:00.372
Turn the heating up, would you?

06:00.372 --> 06:02.332
I'm freezing.

06:10.892 --> 06:12.372
Sid!

06:22.212 --> 06:25.492
Connor, I think I've found something.
Show me.

06:27.932 --> 06:30.052
It's like some kind of lettering.

06:31.692 --> 06:34.172
No, it's a sequence of numbers.

06:34.172 --> 06:36.292
OK. Some kind of code?
Yes, but to what?

06:51.332 --> 06:53.252
Connor, come in and shut the door.

06:53.252 --> 06:56.492
Really?
Yeah. This new lab is amazing.

06:57.412 --> 07:00.532
The temperature and humidity
settings are exactly right

07:00.532 --> 07:03.852
and the plants flowered...overnight.

07:06.292 --> 07:08.452
That was your cue to tell me how
clever I am.

07:09.572 --> 07:11.532
You're brilliant.

07:15.012 --> 07:17.892
How's it going, staying at your
mate's place?

07:19.292 --> 07:21.252
It's good, yeah. All that's...

07:21.252 --> 07:23.812
You know what it's like when old
friends get together.

07:23.812 --> 07:26.812
How about you? How is it living with
your baby brother?

07:29.012 --> 07:31.092
You missing me yet?

07:35.932 --> 07:38.092
What's he doing here?

07:38.092 --> 07:41.372
Ah... It's cleaning day at my mate's
house.

07:41.372 --> 07:43.692
It's a nightmare. I had to bring
them to work.

07:43.692 --> 07:47.732
This is a climate-controlled lab.
You can't treat it like a pet's
adventure playground.

07:47.732 --> 07:52.092
I know, but you just trying looking
after them for one day. It's like
Prison Break with...

07:52.092 --> 07:53.372
beavers.

07:55.772 --> 07:59.372
You're going nowhere until we decide
what to do with you.

07:59.372 --> 08:02.252
Don't get too comfortable.

08:02.252 --> 08:04.452
Karma must really work, eh, Danny?

08:04.452 --> 08:08.572
It's not too long ago that you had
me banged up. Look at you now.

08:08.572 --> 08:11.772
The fact that I saved your life
doesn't win me any credit? No.

08:11.772 --> 08:13.972
What does that machine do, then?

08:13.972 --> 08:16.692
You're not even supposed to be
looking at that machine.

08:16.692 --> 08:18.812
It's top secret, innit?

08:20.212 --> 08:23.012
But it is brilliant. And, you know,
it's completely unique.

08:23.012 --> 08:25.732
Well, I bet you're wondering who
invented it?

08:27.852 --> 08:30.572
Le Connor Temple.
What?

08:30.572 --> 08:34.371
Connor Temple.
That's... I invented it.

08:34.371 --> 08:37.092
So... Why is that screen jumping
around, then?

08:37.092 --> 08:38.491
Jumping?

08:46.372 --> 08:48.332
Oh, my God!

08:56.427 --> 08:59.147
Lester, before you shout at me,
I'm really sorry.

08:59.147 --> 09:02.187
I'll get the hard drive memory back
up and running in seconds.

09:02.187 --> 09:05.107
At the risk of sounding like someone
from the Old Testament,

09:05.107 --> 09:08.907
is there any sane reason why you're
keeping animals in the ARC?

09:11.107 --> 09:13.627
We must have missed an anomaly while
it was offline.

09:14.987 --> 09:17.387
It closed an hour ago. I'll get the
location.

09:17.387 --> 09:20.547
Yes, would you do that? Because that
would be extremely helpful!

09:20.547 --> 09:23.347
Christine Johnson is here to see
you. Here?

09:23.347 --> 09:26.187
James. This isn't a bad time,
I hope?

09:26.187 --> 09:28.747
Christine, what an unexpected
pleasure.

09:30.187 --> 09:32.987
Do we know where Jenny is?
No, sir.

09:32.987 --> 09:35.747
Could you find her for me, please?
Yes, sir.

09:36.987 --> 09:38.627
Now?
Now.

09:40.227 --> 09:42.307
Nothing wrong I hope, James?
Not at all.

09:42.307 --> 09:45.267
Don't you have something you should
be getting on with?

09:49.507 --> 09:52.027
Excuse me, Miss Lewis?

09:52.027 --> 09:54.427
We didn't know what to do with these.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.627
Professor Cutter had no family.

10:20.707 --> 10:22.747
When was that taken?

10:22.747 --> 10:24.907
It wasn't.

10:25.987 --> 10:29.027
It's not me. It's Claudia Brown.

10:29.867 --> 10:33.107
Oh my God, Sarah. I used to be
somebody else.

10:33.107 --> 10:35.307
Jenny, anomaly alert.

10:35.307 --> 10:37.827
I'll cover it.
No. No, I'm fine.

11:07.187 --> 11:09.707
Wow, nice view.

11:11.787 --> 11:14.387
Nice place, if you can afford it.

11:20.067 --> 11:22.747
You know what...?

11:24.587 --> 11:28.747
I know a lot about art, but I don't
really know what I like.

11:30.187 --> 11:32.987
OK, the flat belongs to a Sir
Richard Bentley.

11:32.987 --> 11:35.147
He's the Chairman of the ABS Finance
Group.

11:35.147 --> 11:37.907
First, we need to find out what this
is.

11:37.907 --> 11:40.267
Is it fungal?
Whoa! Whoa, whoa.

11:41.627 --> 11:42.907
Maybe.

11:46.267 --> 11:48.067
Ooh...

11:48.067 --> 11:49.987
Nice!
Mmm.

11:52.347 --> 11:55.547
And you need to go and analyse it,
quick.

11:58.507 --> 12:00.667
Thanks very much.
That's OK.

12:00.667 --> 12:03.827
Armoury to your left, gym to your
right. Research labs are there.

12:04.947 --> 12:07.667
And the operations area you already
know.

12:07.667 --> 12:10.667
Anything else?
Yes, there is just one more thing.

12:10.667 --> 12:12.547
In private.

12:13.867 --> 12:16.747
Tell the Chuckle Brothers not to
touch anything.

12:16.747 --> 12:20.507
I don't think you've met my
colleague Mark Baker, and this is
Captain Wilder.

12:20.507 --> 12:22.587
Delighted.

12:22.587 --> 12:24.467
Shall we?

12:25.307 --> 12:27.507
Oi, trouble, don't think you're going
anywhere.

12:27.507 --> 12:29.267
Make yourself useful. Come with me.

12:38.307 --> 12:41.907
We have good reason to believe that
Helen Cutter had this object
with her.

12:41.907 --> 12:44.667
I'd very much like to find out what
it is.

12:44.667 --> 12:47.427
Why is it so important?
Well, it might not be.

12:47.427 --> 12:49.587
We'd like to be sure.

12:49.587 --> 12:52.507
Never seen it in my life. Perhaps it
was destroyed in the fire.

12:53.867 --> 12:55.747
Perhaps.

12:57.027 --> 13:00.787
So tell me, how is the search for
Cutter's replacement going?

13:00.787 --> 13:03.467
Very well. We have a number of
excellent candidates.

13:03.467 --> 13:06.147
I think I have just the man for you.
Captain Wilder.

13:06.147 --> 13:09.387
He's a fine soldier and an excellent
leader of men.

13:09.387 --> 13:11.987
I'll bear him in mind.
The Minister is very keen on him.

13:11.987 --> 13:15.547
Please do send in his CV. I'll add it
to the pile.

13:38.827 --> 13:40.307
Radical!

13:44.627 --> 13:47.427
Jenny, you have to get out of there!

13:47.427 --> 13:49.347
Quarantine the whole block now!

13:51.467 --> 13:55.507
This fungus is toxic.
It's incredibly aggressive.

13:55.507 --> 13:57.947
You need to trace anybody who's been
exposed to it.

13:57.947 --> 14:00.867
We need to find Sir Richard now.

14:16.947 --> 14:20.827
If I was still a copper, I'd say
that bloke was acting suspiciously.

14:20.827 --> 14:22.427
Mmm.

14:24.067 --> 14:26.027
Where are you going?

14:27.307 --> 14:30.747
You've got two choices - you can
trust me or you can call in the heav
mob.

14:30.747 --> 14:33.787
And why would I trust you, Danny?
Cos if I was going to cause trouble,

14:33.787 --> 14:35.627
I'd have done it a long time ago.

14:35.627 --> 14:38.187
And I've got an honest face.

14:41.187 --> 14:42.867
Thank you. Bye-bye.

14:42.867 --> 14:46.507
OK, that was his office. He's
catching a train. He'll be at St
Pancras any minute.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.347
That's our guy.

16:12.907 --> 16:15.507
What exactly did you do in there?
I didn't do anything.

16:15.507 --> 16:17.547
He's still alive.
We've got to get him out.

16:17.547 --> 16:21.107
Forget it. I'm handling this. I've
had biohazard training. So have I.

16:22.547 --> 16:23.867
Fine.

16:24.627 --> 16:26.987
What's going on?
Everything under control?

16:26.987 --> 16:29.227
Everything is fine.

16:29.227 --> 16:31.227
He's helping me.
Right.

17:01.627 --> 17:03.587
You've killed one of my men.

17:03.587 --> 17:06.666
Care to explain why he was
trespassing in a security zone?

17:06.666 --> 17:09.666
We'll send you a full report when the
post-mortem is in.

17:09.666 --> 17:12.387
Now, for your own safety, I suggest
you leave.

17:19.666 --> 17:21.747
How many of our men do we have
inside here?

17:21.747 --> 17:25.107
Two, on the maintenance staff. I want
every inch under surveillance.

17:25.107 --> 17:28.747
Do you think Lester was lying about
the artefact? Of course he was lying.

17:46.707 --> 17:49.227
Excuse me, have you seen this man?

17:50.387 --> 17:54.307
OK, the train that's departing from
the platform at the far end.

18:04.467 --> 18:06.427
Excuse me.

18:06.427 --> 18:08.787
Guys, we need to rethink this.

18:10.747 --> 18:13.307
Becker, you check inside the train.
Right.

18:13.307 --> 18:16.227
Better make plans to evacuate.
We could be lucky.

18:16.227 --> 18:18.187
Maybe he hasn't been contaminated.

18:24.387 --> 18:26.307
Sir Richard?

18:36.747 --> 18:38.747
It must have come through the
anomaly.

18:41.147 --> 18:43.547
Past or future?
Does it matter?

18:46.027 --> 18:49.267
Can you kill it?
I'll have to do some more tests.

18:49.267 --> 18:53.067
Unless we find out how to stop it,
there's going to be a lot more
infected people.

18:53.067 --> 18:55.427
Yes, thank you, Danny.
I do realise that.

18:59.667 --> 19:01.587
He's not on the train.
I don't get it.

19:01.587 --> 19:03.707
I'm telling you, I saw him here a
minute ago.

19:06.547 --> 19:08.027
Over there.

19:21.867 --> 19:25.107
I'm going to get out of this thing.
What are you doing? Are you mad?

19:25.107 --> 19:28.747
When did you actually have biohazard
training?

19:33.347 --> 19:34.987
Connor!

19:35.907 --> 19:37.107
Danny!

19:40.747 --> 19:42.507
What's she saying?

19:44.267 --> 19:45.787
Turn around.

19:58.627 --> 20:01.107
Come on, guys!

20:01.107 --> 20:02.747
Come on!

20:11.187 --> 20:13.147
What is that?

20:16.827 --> 20:18.827
What is that?

21:05.067 --> 21:06.827
Sir Richard?

21:12.147 --> 21:15.147
Well, this could be tricky to
explain to the next of kin.

21:16.107 --> 21:18.227
Good news, he's not technically dead.

21:18.227 --> 21:21.147
The bad news, he's turned into a
mushroom.

21:23.307 --> 21:26.027
What are we going to do with it?
I don't know.

21:26.867 --> 21:29.867
This all happened when it reacted
with the saline solution.

21:29.867 --> 21:32.867
Well, all fungi like damp
environments, right?

21:32.867 --> 21:35.267
Why don't we try drying it out?
Bake the hell out of it.

21:35.267 --> 21:37.507
We'll see what happens.

21:54.827 --> 21:57.107
These tunnels must go on for miles.

21:57.107 --> 21:59.267
We're going to need some light.

22:04.427 --> 22:06.387
It's not responding.

22:07.547 --> 22:10.267
Right. So come on, what's our plan B?

22:14.787 --> 22:18.907
You know, just once...
just once would be nice.

22:38.707 --> 22:40.347
Look...

22:40.347 --> 22:42.227
Something's happening.

22:50.467 --> 22:52.107
Aaargh!

22:54.267 --> 22:56.027
Result!

22:56.027 --> 22:57.467
Yes!

23:12.467 --> 23:14.467
Abby!

23:21.107 --> 23:22.827
Take it out, now!

23:30.907 --> 23:32.947
Stay back!

23:32.947 --> 23:34.907
Don't touch him!

23:38.787 --> 23:41.667
We need a containment unit down here
straight away.

23:50.904 --> 23:53.424
If baking worked, burning's going to
be even better.

23:53.424 --> 23:55.384
We're going to incinerate it.
- Makes sense.

23:56.424 --> 23:58.384
Whoa, what do you think you're doing?

23:58.384 --> 24:00.664
What does it look like?
Oh, that's a great idea.

24:00.664 --> 24:03.384
Let's send a criminal onto the
streets with a flame thrower!

24:03.384 --> 24:05.664
I'm not a criminal.
Well, you broke in here.

24:05.664 --> 24:07.824
Yeah, well, I didn't steal anything,
did I?

24:07.824 --> 24:12.184
You're splitting hairs. The point is,
a) you should be in custody,
b) you're not part of the team.

24:12.184 --> 24:14.424
He's done a pretty good job for us.
Twice.

24:15.144 --> 24:18.784
Three times. We need all the help we
can get. We should trust him.

24:18.784 --> 24:22.544
Fantastic! You've been here five
minutes and I've already got a mutiny
on my hands.

24:22.544 --> 24:26.024
Do you know how to use that thing?
No, but I mean how hard can it be?

24:26.024 --> 24:29.784
Right, he goes,
you two geniuses stay here.

24:29.784 --> 24:32.384
You're kidding?
I so wanted to fire this.

24:32.384 --> 24:35.024
Find a way to stop this
before it infects anyone else.

24:35.024 --> 24:37.304
I don't want any more Fungus the
Bogeymen!

24:38.864 --> 24:42.904
The management accepts no
responsibility for personal loss
or injury!

24:42.904 --> 24:44.304
Good luck!

24:46.584 --> 24:49.744
Basically, it's a fungus.

24:49.744 --> 24:52.184
And it likes damp and dark places.

24:52.184 --> 24:54.584
Chances are it's still in here
somewhere.

24:54.584 --> 24:58.384
Look, don't let any of your men get
near it. I can't risk anyone else
being infected.

24:58.384 --> 25:02.624
How are we supposed to contain this
thing when our gunfire is completely
ineffective?

25:02.624 --> 25:05.424
Well, Danny's on his way down with
the flame throwers.

25:06.944 --> 25:08.864
Danny?
He volunteered.

25:10.824 --> 25:14.024
He's keen.
Yeah, that's one way of putting it.

25:16.704 --> 25:18.944
Just look at those plants.

25:18.944 --> 25:21.024
Abby is so going to kill me.

25:21.024 --> 25:22.424
Yep.

25:26.184 --> 25:28.184
Sid? That's where you are.

25:29.464 --> 25:31.424
Great, now I have to go back in.

25:32.624 --> 25:34.584
This day just keeps getting better!

25:42.744 --> 25:46.144
Are you sure this is going to work?
100%. Come on, let's go.

25:46.144 --> 25:49.104
Excuse me! Er, sorry,
who put you in charge?

25:49.104 --> 25:52.864
Look, if I'm going to go in there
first, then I'm going to call the
shots, all right?

25:52.864 --> 25:55.024
OK, follow him, but at a distance.

25:55.024 --> 25:57.704
So, look, we corner it and then we
grill it, right?

25:57.704 --> 25:59.624
Isn't that cruel?
What?

25:59.624 --> 26:03.064
Well, that thing was a man
not long ago.

26:03.064 --> 26:05.384
Suppose he's still in there
somewhere?

26:05.384 --> 26:09.584
OK, so we ask it nicely,
and then we grill it, right?

26:09.584 --> 26:11.264
Thank you.

26:23.264 --> 26:24.904
Sid!

26:24.904 --> 26:27.184
What are you doing?
Stop messing about.

26:28.744 --> 26:30.904
Come down from there, 
come on.

26:30.904 --> 26:32.944
It's not funny.

26:32.944 --> 26:35.144
Sid, this is not a game!

26:56.504 --> 26:58.824
Dark and damp, just like I said.

26:58.824 --> 27:00.904
Yeah, bingo.

27:03.864 --> 27:06.744
Split into two teams.

27:18.104 --> 27:19.984
Connor, get out of there now!

27:19.984 --> 27:22.744
What we thought was ash was just
millions of spores.

27:22.744 --> 27:26.024
It's reproducing itself. If it gets
into the ARC, we're finished.

27:26.024 --> 27:28.104
So fire won't kill it?
Listen...

27:28.104 --> 27:30.304
No, tell Danny
if he tries to burn it,

27:30.304 --> 27:33.144
it's going to spread
through half of London.

27:57.984 --> 28:00.784
Sarah?
Jenny, don't use the flame throwers.

28:02.304 --> 28:04.264
I can't hear you.

28:05.264 --> 28:09.144
What? You're breaking up, I can't
hear what you're saying.

28:11.744 --> 28:13.744
Anything?
Nothing.

28:13.744 --> 28:15.624
Are you saying to go ahead?
No!

28:15.624 --> 28:17.624
No, listen...

28:17.624 --> 28:19.824
Cut off.

28:23.144 --> 28:25.384
Becker, get down here.

28:25.384 --> 28:27.904
We've got him cornered, he's got
nowhere to go.

28:40.784 --> 28:43.384
It looks like someone's sneezed.

28:44.184 --> 28:46.264
Sarah?
Ready!

28:46.264 --> 28:49.064
Do not use the flame throwers!
Stop!

28:49.064 --> 28:52.344
What? Fire doesn't work.
Stay away from it.

28:52.904 --> 28:55.264
There it goes!
Don't lose it!

28:57.384 --> 28:59.744
We've got to drive it upstairs,
contain it.

28:59.744 --> 29:03.064
David Lodge? Have you still got that
truck?

29:08.264 --> 29:11.064
What is it now?

29:11.064 --> 29:13.384
Heat, it likes heat.

29:13.384 --> 29:15.184
So...

29:16.064 --> 29:18.024
Logically...

29:29.704 --> 29:31.624
We can freeze it.

29:31.624 --> 29:33.464
Sarah, we can freeze it.

29:33.464 --> 29:35.904
Turn the temperature gauge down to
as low as it will go.

29:35.904 --> 29:38.384
What about you?
You'll freeze to death. - Do it.

29:38.384 --> 29:40.144
I'll be fine.

29:57.946 --> 30:00.026
Danny, it's gone up the stairs.

30:03.466 --> 30:05.626
Has the truck arrived?
- Seconds away.

30:05.626 --> 30:08.146
Then what?
- I'll get back to you.

30:09.026 --> 30:11.706
For a minute, I thought he knew what
he was doing.

30:18.666 --> 30:20.666
Keep going!

30:36.586 --> 30:39.306
Move, move! Come on, quickly!
Whoa, whoa!

30:57.426 --> 31:00.586
Come on, Connor, give us a sign.
It's dying.

31:08.386 --> 31:10.346
Right, get him out of there.

31:12.626 --> 31:15.066
Where's those blankets? Come on!

31:16.626 --> 31:18.786
Connor?
I'm fine.

31:18.786 --> 31:20.786
Let's get a refrigerator truck over
there.

31:23.066 --> 31:27.306
James, OK, we've got it cornered.
But there's no chance of holding it
here. It's too dangerous.

31:27.306 --> 31:30.386
Listen, the longer we wait, the more
people get infected.

31:30.386 --> 31:34.546
Just...keep it busy until the freezer
truck arrives.

31:34.546 --> 31:37.826
What do you suggest?
Give it the Financial Times to read
while we wait?

31:37.826 --> 31:41.266
Look, we're bringing it to the ARC.
So just get everything ready,
all right?

31:41.266 --> 31:43.106
No... Hello?

31:43.106 --> 31:44.986
I don't believe that!

32:00.866 --> 32:03.746
I'll see you there!
Oh, OK.

32:06.146 --> 32:08.626
He's really overdoing the Alpha male
bit, isn't he?

32:08.626 --> 32:10.906
Something's wrong.

32:12.386 --> 32:14.746
No Sat Nav!
Show us the way to the ARC.

32:33.946 --> 32:35.866
Sarah, you're on!

32:39.506 --> 32:41.786
Yes! It's working.

32:41.786 --> 32:45.226
In a few minutes' time,
this place is going to be colder
than the North Pole.

32:48.106 --> 32:50.186
I hope someone's paid the Congestion
Charge.

32:50.186 --> 32:52.466
You're actually enjoying yourself,
aren't you?

32:52.466 --> 32:55.906
Well, you only live once.
Not in my case, apparently.

32:55.906 --> 32:58.066
Come again?
Long story.

32:58.066 --> 33:00.186
Well, try me.

33:00.186 --> 33:04.466
No offence, Danny, but there was
only one man who understood and he's
not here any more, so...

33:04.466 --> 33:06.466
Shut up!

33:11.786 --> 33:14.186
Please tell me this is someone with
a plan.

33:14.186 --> 33:17.746
That's everybody out now.
We're dropping the temperature
in the main room.

33:17.746 --> 33:20.586
You need to hold the creature until
we're ready. No problem.

33:20.586 --> 33:23.066
When I give the word, Danny, release
the creature.

33:23.066 --> 33:25.826
We need to get it into the
operations area so we can freeze it.

33:25.826 --> 33:28.266
Yeah, you make it sound so simple.

33:28.266 --> 33:31.546
We're going to need
a bit more time. I reckon five
minutes should do.

33:31.546 --> 33:33.466
You've got it.

33:35.346 --> 33:37.626
What about thirty seconds?
Huh?

33:48.466 --> 33:51.346
We've lost it.
You what?

33:51.346 --> 33:54.586
Well, on a positive note, at least
we've got it in the building.

33:54.586 --> 33:56.946
It's definitely in here.
We just don't know where.

34:05.666 --> 34:08.946
Guys, listen up, the creature's
going to be hiding somewhere dark.

34:08.946 --> 34:11.786
We need to force it down this
corridor, through those doors.

34:11.786 --> 34:13.826
How do we do that?
Freezing carbon dioxide.

34:15.985 --> 34:18.226
Whatever you do,
don't let it touch you.

34:18.226 --> 34:21.025
I wasn't gonna shake hands with it.
Let's find this thing!

34:21.025 --> 34:23.746
Right, there's two extinguishers in
the Ops Area.

34:32.186 --> 34:33.545
Ooh...

34:34.585 --> 34:37.985
The temperature is dropping, fast.
Yeah.

34:37.985 --> 34:41.065
All right, let's find these fire
extinguishers and get out of here.

34:58.746 --> 35:01.986
Where does that vent lead to?
Back into the cooling system.

35:03.066 --> 35:07.106
The only other access point is
through the Operations Room.

35:07.106 --> 35:09.066
It's heading exactly where we need
it to go.

35:11.226 --> 35:13.306
Go ahead.

35:15.866 --> 35:17.986
Danny, hi.
Jen, good news.

35:17.986 --> 35:20.626
It's heading directly back to the
Operations Room.

35:20.626 --> 35:23.746
But I'm still in here.
Jen, get out of there.

35:23.746 --> 35:25.626
Get out of there now!

35:48.626 --> 35:50.386
Jenny!

35:56.786 --> 35:59.186
Abby, stay there! It's too
dangerous!

36:11.106 --> 36:13.066
What's going on?

36:14.826 --> 36:17.746
The creature's searching for heat.
But it's freezing in there!

36:17.746 --> 36:20.226
It's Jen's body heat. It's drawing
it towards her.

36:26.666 --> 36:28.146
Come on!

36:40.186 --> 36:41.866
Jenny!

36:41.866 --> 36:43.386
Jenny!

36:43.386 --> 36:45.106
No, no, no...

36:45.106 --> 36:46.986
No, no, stay on your feet, Jenny!

36:48.306 --> 36:50.586
Jenny!

37:01.106 --> 37:03.226
It's going to kill her.
Turn off the cold air.

37:03.226 --> 37:05.906
The creature's not dead.
Jenny's going to die if we don't!

37:16.106 --> 37:18.706
Give me a minute.
Danny!

37:18.706 --> 37:20.906
Oi!

37:20.906 --> 37:23.226
What's he doing?
Over here!

37:29.626 --> 37:31.626
Come and have a go at someone your
own size!

37:45.066 --> 37:46.986
It's working.
Come on.

37:50.346 --> 37:52.826
The creature's freezing.
It's...it's dying.

37:58.066 --> 38:00.386
Go, go, go, go!

38:01.986 --> 38:03.906
Let's get her out of here!

38:03.906 --> 38:07.826
No, don't touch her! The only chance
she's got is if the cold kills the fungus.

38:07.826 --> 38:09.706
We wait, OK?

38:09.706 --> 38:11.106
Yeah.

38:17.026 --> 38:19.226
Come on.

38:19.226 --> 38:21.626
No!
Danny, listen to me!

38:21.626 --> 38:25.586
It's killing her! But if we take her
out now, she'll end up like that.

38:25.586 --> 38:28.266
Trust me, please.

38:33.306 --> 38:34.866
Come on...

38:49.426 --> 38:52.906
OK, OK, she's clear.
I've got her.

38:52.906 --> 38:54.066
OK.

38:55.426 --> 38:57.506
Bring her through here.

38:58.666 --> 39:00.786
Take her head, take her head.

39:01.666 --> 39:04.826
If she's been frozen quickly, there's
a chance we can bring her back.

39:04.826 --> 39:06.546
Keep warming her.

39:07.386 --> 39:10.026
Here we go.
Come on, Jenny.

39:12.666 --> 39:15.586
Anything?
No pulse.

39:19.626 --> 39:21.986
Come on, Jen. Come on.

39:23.306 --> 39:25.106
Not again.

39:25.106 --> 39:27.666
If she stays like this for a few
minutes, we've lost her.

39:27.666 --> 39:29.426
Not again. Please, not again.

39:30.346 --> 39:32.106
Come on. Don't bail on us now.

39:40.426 --> 39:42.266
Anything?

39:44.186 --> 39:47.386
I've got a pulse.

39:47.386 --> 39:49.826
Yes!

39:52.026 --> 39:53.906
Here she comes. Hey, hey.

39:53.906 --> 39:55.146
Nick...

39:56.626 --> 39:59.586
He's gone. Remember?

40:06.706 --> 40:09.586
You can let go of my hand now.

40:09.586 --> 40:11.546
Oh, sorry, sorry.

40:12.826 --> 40:15.146
Hey, welcome back.

40:16.826 --> 40:19.386
You scared us.

40:32.306 --> 40:34.266
You all right?

40:35.426 --> 40:37.386
I'm fine.

40:39.306 --> 40:42.626
You know, I'll never look at
athlete's foot the same way again.

40:45.306 --> 40:48.826
James, there's something I need to
discuss with you.

40:52.506 --> 40:55.946
Glad you could drop by at such short
notice.

40:55.946 --> 40:59.786
Now, Christine, I wanted you to be
the first to know.

40:59.786 --> 41:04.746
You're right, I am going to need a
man just like Captain Wilder to
replace Cutter.

41:04.746 --> 41:07.586
I'm glad you've come round to my way
of thinking.

41:07.586 --> 41:10.866
Oh, not Wilder himself, of course.
No, he's...

41:10.866 --> 41:13.106
playing much too vital a role on your
own staff.

41:13.106 --> 41:15.626
But Danny Quinn here
is just like him.

41:15.626 --> 41:19.346
Background in the police, firearms
training, management skills.

41:19.346 --> 41:22.946
The perfect choice. I've already
cleared it with the Minister.

41:31.586 --> 41:35.306
Congratulations. I'm sure we'll be
seeing a lot of each other.

41:44.866 --> 41:47.746
I trust that's all right with you?
If it's OK with these guys,

41:47.746 --> 41:49.946
then it's all right with me.
Their idea.

41:50.786 --> 41:52.826
Jenny, most of all.

41:54.226 --> 41:56.106
Um, Guv...

41:56.106 --> 41:58.706
What's the pay?

41:59.746 --> 42:01.786
Next to nothing.

42:01.786 --> 42:03.986
Seems fair.

42:03.986 --> 42:07.466
Try not to make a complete dog's
breakfast of this, won't you?

42:11.426 --> 42:13.386
Where's Jenny?

42:16.106 --> 42:18.426
Guys, is there something you're not
telling me?

42:20.386 --> 42:22.306
What's going on?

42:28.026 --> 42:30.106
You can't leave.

42:30.106 --> 42:32.306
I have to.
It's your team.

42:34.106 --> 42:35.586
No.

42:35.586 --> 42:39.066
It was Cutter's, and now it's yours.

42:40.466 --> 42:43.146
I don't belong here any more.
Course you do.

42:43.146 --> 42:45.586
Danny, I died today.

42:45.586 --> 42:47.986
I think I should really quit
while I'm ahead.

42:49.466 --> 42:52.906
I know you, and I know all about
Claudia Brown.

42:52.906 --> 42:57.306
And I'm sure there's some perfectly
rational explanation.

42:57.306 --> 42:59.986
Yeah, that's what I used to think.

42:59.986 --> 43:02.106
Maybe we've all lived other lives,

43:02.106 --> 43:05.626
but what's important is who we are
right now.

43:05.626 --> 43:07.586
You're absolutely right.

43:08.746 --> 43:10.986
And that's exactly why I have to go.

43:10.986 --> 43:12.986
Danny, if I stay here,

43:12.986 --> 43:15.946
I'll always be looking back,
wondering who I really am.

43:15.946 --> 43:20.226
I just want to go and try and forget
about the ARC

43:20.226 --> 43:22.786
and forget about the creatures and
the anomalies.

43:22.786 --> 43:24.866
And most of all,

43:24.866 --> 43:29.666
I really want to try and forget
about Nick Cutter and Claudia Brown.

43:29.666 --> 43:31.906
You said it yourself, you only live
once.

43:32.866 --> 43:36.106
You can try to forget him, Jenny,
but you never will.

43:46.746 --> 43:48.466
Good luck.

44:43.130 --> 44:45.290
Sweet dreams, guys. Eh?

44:55.050 --> 44:56.930
Are you living here?

45:00.530 --> 45:02.450
Yes.

45:02.450 --> 45:04.650
But it's strictly temporary.

45:04.650 --> 45:08.330
You know how many clauses of the
Health and Safety guidelines this
breaches?

45:08.330 --> 45:10.010
Sorry.

45:11.250 --> 45:16.690
Oh, look, I've got a small place in
the City I use during the week.

45:16.690 --> 45:18.770
You can um...

45:18.770 --> 45:20.650
stay there.

45:20.650 --> 45:22.610
Till you find something.

45:22.610 --> 45:24.290
Really?

45:24.290 --> 45:26.530
Yes. And Connor?

45:26.530 --> 45:29.770
Yes?
Put some trousers on.

45:35.770 --> 45:38.370
I've got a feeling I'm going to
profoundly regret this.

45:45.450 --> 45:48.290
I don't take orders from you.
You do now.

45:48.290 --> 45:50.570
She knows we've got it.
We've got five minutes.

45:50.570 --> 45:52.690
I hope you know what you're doing!

45:53.450 --> 45:54.770
Stop!

46:02.090 --> 46:04.250
We're not going to give up
without a fight, are we?
