JANJA: Come on, fur brains!
Move it!

01:08.302 --> 01:10.269
Before the Lion Guard
shows up.

01:10.304 --> 01:12.071
Right! Move it, melon!

01:13.207 --> 01:16.308
Janja! This melon's
got water inside it.

01:16.343 --> 01:18.243
They all do, fur-brain.

01:18.279 --> 01:19.945
That's why we're takin' 'em.

01:19.980 --> 01:23.082
Really? Ooh, good.
I'm thirsty.

01:24.351 --> 01:25.984
(STRUGGLING)

01:28.022 --> 01:30.322
Enough messin' around.
Let's go!

01:30.357 --> 01:32.291
KION: Stop right there, Janja!

01:32.326 --> 01:34.426
Those melons are
for the elephants!

01:34.462 --> 01:39.131
Oh, are they?
Well, don't worry, Kion.
We'll bring 'em right back.

01:39.166 --> 01:41.100
After we drink
all their water.

01:41.135 --> 01:42.267
Move it, fellas!

01:44.004 --> 01:45.104
We gotta stop them!

01:45.139 --> 01:46.105
Come on!

01:47.308 --> 01:49.274
Faster, fellas!

01:49.310 --> 01:51.977
You want fast?
You got it!<i> Huwezi!</i>

01:52.346 --> 01:53.345
(GRUNTS)

01:53.380 --> 01:55.147
Hey! (GRUNTS)

01:58.185 --> 01:59.184
That's one!

01:59.220 --> 02:01.019
Give back that
melon, Chungu!

02:01.055 --> 02:02.087
Uh-uh.

02:02.123 --> 02:03.989
I stole it fair and square!

02:05.059 --> 02:06.325
(GROANS)

02:06.360 --> 02:09.061
There's nothing fair
about stealing!

02:09.096 --> 02:11.196
Bunga! We've got a loose one!

02:11.232 --> 02:13.966
<i> Zuka Zama!</i>
That's two!

02:15.102 --> 02:16.201
Give it up, Janja!

02:16.237 --> 02:17.336
(GRUNTS)

02:17.371 --> 02:19.972
Somebody grab
that last melon!

02:20.007 --> 02:22.141
I got it! I got it!
(GRUNTS)

02:23.210 --> 02:24.376
I don't got it.

02:25.412 --> 02:27.079
BESHTE: Good try, Little B.

02:27.114 --> 02:28.413
At least we saved
the other ones.

02:28.449 --> 02:31.350
How'd the hyenas even find
the elephants' melon patch?

02:31.385 --> 02:33.218
(SCOFFS) Luck,
I'm guessing.

02:33.254 --> 02:36.121
Gotta be. The patch
is really well hidden.

02:36.157 --> 02:38.357
Indeed. It's even difficult
for me to see!

02:38.392 --> 02:42.060
We'll have to keep
a close eye on them,
in case the hyenas come back.

02:42.096 --> 02:43.428
We gotta guard fruit?

02:43.464 --> 02:46.298
The melons help
give the elephants
the water they need

02:46.333 --> 02:48.133
to make it through
the dry season.

02:48.169 --> 02:49.334
Common knowledge, really.

02:49.370 --> 02:51.370
It's all part of
the Circle of Life.

02:51.405 --> 02:54.339
And defending it is our job.

02:54.375 --> 02:57.276
JANJA: (SIGHS)
<i> Another one of</i>
<i> my brilliant plans,</i>

02:57.311 --> 02:59.278
ruined by the Lion Guard!

02:59.313 --> 03:02.214
Yeah. Those guys are always
gettin' in our way.

03:02.249 --> 03:04.183
Huh? No! (HISSES)

03:04.218 --> 03:06.051
(ALL GRUNT)

03:06.086 --> 03:09.087

03:09.123 --> 03:11.990
Excuse me?
Watch your step!

SCAR: Enough!

03:13.160 --> 03:14.359
(ROARING)

03:16.197 --> 03:17.262
Hi, Scar.

03:17.298 --> 03:20.265
What happened this time?

03:20.301 --> 03:24.102
We stumbled onto
some Tikiti melons
and was gonna take 'em.

03:24.138 --> 03:28.407
But then the Lion Guard
stumbled onto us, and, uh...

03:28.442 --> 03:30.375
Tikiti melons!

03:30.411 --> 03:32.978
Ah, yes.

03:33.013 --> 03:35.113
Did you know
they got water
inside 'em?

03:35.149 --> 03:37.950
Yes. Precious water.

03:37.985 --> 03:40.285
The Pride Lands' elephants
would be vulnerable

03:40.321 --> 03:42.221
without those melons.

03:42.256 --> 03:45.090
Especially during
the dry season.

03:45.125 --> 03:47.159
Hyenas!
(ALL WHIMPER)

03:47.194 --> 03:50.429
Go back and take all
of the Tikiti melons.

03:50.464 --> 03:53.131
If the elephants don't
have enough water,

03:53.167 --> 03:56.034
it will mean the
end of their herd!

03:56.070 --> 03:59.338
And perhaps
the Circle of Life, as well!

03:59.373 --> 04:00.973
(CHUCKLES MENACINGLY)

04:01.008 --> 04:04.209
Uh, Scar?
We totally wanna help.

04:04.245 --> 04:07.279
But the Lion Guard's
just gonna stop us again.

04:07.314 --> 04:10.315
I know a lizard who can
stop the Lion Guard.

04:10.351 --> 04:14.152
Then you'll have plenty
of time to steal the melons.

04:14.188 --> 04:17.155
A lizard? You mean,
like one of those skinks?

04:17.191 --> 04:18.957

little lizard gonna
stop the Lion Guard?

04:22.263 --> 04:26.331
Trust me, my friend
is not a little lizard.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.066
He's very big.

04:28.102 --> 04:29.201

06:23.217 --> 06:24.950
Certainly.

06:25.419 --> 06:27.018
And, hyenas?

06:27.087 --> 06:28.387
Whatever you do,

06:28.422 --> 06:31.256
don't call Kenge
a "little lizard."

06:32.059 --> 06:33.091
Why's that?

06:33.127 --> 06:35.160
You don't want to know.

Uh, a big lizard!

06:50.978 --> 06:53.245
(STAMMERS) You're
a very big, big lizard!

06:53.280 --> 06:55.947
That's right.
And don't forget it.

06:57.317 --> 06:59.951
I wouldn't want
to be his enemy.

06:59.987 --> 07:01.953
I don't even wanna
be his friend!

07:01.989 --> 07:04.923
Don't worry.
We're not friends.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.124

Enough chit-chat!
Time to find the Lion Guard.

07:10.330 --> 07:13.165
Find 'em?
How you gonna do that?

07:13.200 --> 07:17.002
I'm going to let them find me!

07:17.037 --> 07:19.371
Kion, how much longer are
we gonna stick around here?

07:19.406 --> 07:22.340
You really think
the hyenas'll come back
knowin' we're around?

07:22.376 --> 07:25.143
Not too smart,
if you ask me.

07:25.179 --> 07:27.379
Hyenas aren't smart.
Remember?

07:27.414 --> 07:29.948
Yeah, yeah, I know.

07:29.983 --> 07:31.316
Fuli's right, Bunga.

07:31.351 --> 07:32.384
Janja might come back

07:32.419 --> 07:35.020
and we can't risk
losing these melons.

07:35.055 --> 07:36.321
Ono? Take another look?

07:36.356 --> 07:38.023
Affirmative!

07:38.959 --> 07:41.226
I don't see any hyenas.

07:41.261 --> 07:42.260
But...

07:43.997 --> 07:45.096
<i> Hapana!</i>

07:45.132 --> 07:47.232
Animals are being attacked
at the watering hole!

07:47.267 --> 07:49.100
Attacked? By who?

07:49.136 --> 07:52.237
I can't tell.
There's too much chaos!

07:52.272 --> 07:55.207
But whatever it is,
it's fast. And big!

07:55.242 --> 07:56.975
Then we've gotta stop it!

07:57.010 --> 07:59.344
Ono? Be sure to keep an eye
on the melons, too.

07:59.379 --> 08:00.879
Affirmative!

08:00.914 --> 08:03.181
Now let's go.
Till the Pride Lands end...

08:03.217 --> 08:05.150
ALL: Lion Guard defend!

08:11.225 --> 08:14.025
(LAUGHS) That's right!

Run away from the big lizard!

Stop this attack! Now!

08:24.271 --> 08:26.137
Well, fun's over.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.272
I don't know
who you are,

08:27.307 --> 08:30.108
but this is not
how we do things
in the Pride Lands!

08:30.143 --> 08:33.245
Yeah! Around here we
respect the Circle of Life!

08:33.280 --> 08:36.014
You must be the Lion Guard.

08:36.049 --> 08:39.217
That's right.
Protectors of
the Pride Lands!

08:39.253 --> 08:42.320
Yeah. They said
you talked like that.

08:42.356 --> 08:45.056
Then I bet you're not
happy to see us!

08:45.092 --> 08:47.192
Actually, I'm thrilled.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.961
Bring it on.

08:49.997 --> 08:51.196
You asked for it.

08:51.231 --> 08:52.230

Ow!

09:03.343 --> 09:06.111
My legs!
What's going on?

09:06.146 --> 09:07.913
Kion!
What's wrong?

09:07.948 --> 09:09.981
I don't feel so good!

09:10.017 --> 09:11.316
(GRUNTS)

09:11.351 --> 09:14.019
Ushari was right
about Kenge.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.220
He's takin' 'em down!

09:15.255 --> 09:16.888
Yeah! (CACKLES)

09:16.924 --> 09:18.290
Down and out!

09:18.325 --> 09:20.225
Come on, I dare you!

09:20.260 --> 09:23.261
(LAUGHS) Listen
to the honey badger!

09:23.330 --> 09:26.031
He thinks he's brave enough
to fight Kenge!

09:26.066 --> 09:28.333
Biggest lizard
in the Outlands!

09:28.368 --> 09:31.002
I don't just think it!
I know it!

09:31.038 --> 09:34.272
Really? I smell fear.

09:34.308 --> 09:37.075
I'll give you
something to smell!

09:37.110 --> 09:38.376
(BUNGA FARTS)

09:45.352 --> 09:47.052

09:47.387 --> 09:49.988
Smells like victory.

09:50.357 --> 09:51.923
Are you guys okay?

09:51.959 --> 09:53.058
Yeah, but...

09:53.093 --> 09:56.194
(GRUNTS)
My legs won't move!

09:56.229 --> 09:58.196
(GRUNTS) Neither will mine!

09:58.231 --> 10:00.098
I can't even feel them.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.933
They're just numb.

10:01.969 --> 10:05.136
Of course. Kenge must
be a monitor lizard!

10:05.172 --> 10:07.005
I've never seen one
until now!

10:07.040 --> 10:09.140
What does that have to do
with our legs being numb?

10:09.176 --> 10:12.944
A monitor lizard's bite
contains venom
which causes paralysis.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.179
Common knowledge, really.

10:14.214 --> 10:16.147
So that's why
our legs won't move?

10:16.183 --> 10:17.415
Yes, but don't worry.

10:17.451 --> 10:20.185
The venom will wear off
and your legs will go
back to normal.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.386
Great! When?

10:21.421 --> 10:24.422
(GASPS) I have no idea.

10:24.458 --> 10:27.192
Well, we can't
just sit here!

10:27.227 --> 10:29.327
That lizard is roaming
the Pride Lands!

10:29.363 --> 10:31.096
He could bite someone else!

10:31.131 --> 10:33.098
Ono, get Rafiki.

10:33.133 --> 10:36.101
Maybe he has a remedy that
can heal our legs faster.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.069
Affirmative!

10:38.105 --> 10:40.305
Don't worry.
I'll stay here
and protect you

10:40.340 --> 10:42.340
in case that lizard
comes back.

10:42.376 --> 10:43.975
Ugh!

10:45.045 --> 10:47.312
Rafiki? Rafiki!

10:47.347 --> 10:50.415
Oh, please be home,
please be home. Rafiki?

10:52.085 --> 10:54.252
Oh, hi, Ono!
Rafiki's gone for the day.

10:54.287 --> 10:55.453
I'm watching his tree.

10:55.489 --> 10:58.456
Well, I'm not really
watching it, I'm more like...

10:58.492 --> 11:01.092
A monitor lizard bit
Kion, Fuli and Beshte!

11:01.128 --> 11:02.961
Their legs won't move!

11:02.996 --> 11:06.965
Oh, no! If they can't move,
then they can't protect
the Pride Lands.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.299
And if they can't protect
the Pride Lands,

11:08.335 --> 11:10.235
then the Pride Lands
are unprotected, and...

11:10.270 --> 11:12.037
The venom will wear off.

11:12.072 --> 11:15.173
We were hoping
Rafiki had a remedy
to help them heal faster.

11:15.208 --> 11:19.044
Oh, I'm sure he does!
Oh, but he's not here.
Oh, but I'm here.

11:19.079 --> 11:22.947
And Rafiki's teaching me
all about remedies.
So maybe I can help!

11:22.983 --> 11:25.283
But, we were...
Or, I mean, I can try to help.

11:25.318 --> 11:27.352
I've never actually
made a remedy before.

11:27.387 --> 11:28.953
I've watched him
do it, though.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.388
Thanks, Makini.

11:30.424 --> 11:33.992
The Lion Guard has
to stop that lizard before
he bites someone else!

11:34.027 --> 11:35.260
Who's the fastest now, Fuli?

11:35.295 --> 11:37.295
Huh? Huh?
Who's the fastest now?

11:38.098 --> 11:39.330
Still me.

11:39.366 --> 11:42.400
Yeah, okay.
But I'm still
the bravest!

11:42.436 --> 11:44.102
ONO: Everyone! Everyone!

11:44.137 --> 11:46.171
Rafiki's gone all day...

11:46.206 --> 11:47.405
But I'm here!

11:47.441 --> 11:50.208
And I'm going to find a way
to help your legs heal faster!

11:50.243 --> 11:52.343
Or, I'm gonna try.

11:52.379 --> 11:53.378
Thanks, Makini!

11:53.413 --> 11:55.413
Yeah! We've gotta
get back on our feet

11:55.449 --> 11:57.048
and catch that lizard!

11:57.084 --> 11:58.450
We really need your help.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.085
But no pressure.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.920
Okay, now, let's see.

12:01.955 --> 12:04.923
I remember Rafiki telling me
something that can help heal.

12:04.958 --> 12:08.393
I think it was Ghanda root!
Or the kioo stone.

12:08.428 --> 12:11.029
Or maybe kupona sap?

12:11.064 --> 12:12.163
She's still learning.

12:12.199 --> 12:16.201
(GASPS) Oh, oh, I know!
Ponya flowers!

12:16.236 --> 12:20.038
I'm almost totally sure
that's what Rafiki said
can help!

12:20.073 --> 12:21.306
Okay!
Great!

12:21.341 --> 12:25.243
Oh. But I don't have
any Ponya flowers. Do you?

12:25.278 --> 12:27.112
Uh, no.

12:27.147 --> 12:28.980
I can find
the flowers, Makini.

12:29.015 --> 12:30.215
I am the keenest of sight.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.283
Oh, thank you, Ono!
That would be great.

12:32.319 --> 12:35.987
Especially because
I don't know what
Ponya flowers look like!

12:36.022 --> 12:37.355
Well, they're bright red...

12:37.390 --> 12:38.389
Hmm.

12:40.293 --> 12:42.427
And there's a big bush
of them by Big Springs!

12:42.462 --> 12:44.262
(HYENAS CACKLING)
Wait a tick.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.332
(GASPS)<i> Hapana!</i>

12:47.367 --> 12:50.001
Everyone! Janja,
Cheezi and Chungu

12:50.036 --> 12:51.436
are heading back
to the melon patch.

12:51.471 --> 12:53.171
And Kenge's with them!

12:53.206 --> 12:55.039
<i> Heyvi kabisa!</i>

12:55.075 --> 12:57.342
The hyenas
and the monitor lizard?

12:57.377 --> 12:59.077
They must be working together!

12:59.112 --> 13:00.078
But why?

13:00.113 --> 13:02.914
Janja must have
asked Kenge to bite us

13:02.949 --> 13:05.250
so we couldn't stop them
from taking the melons!

13:05.285 --> 13:07.952
Wait till I get my legs back.

13:07.988 --> 13:08.987
And you will!

13:09.022 --> 13:11.089
As soon as I get
the Ponya flowers!

13:11.124 --> 13:15.059
Bunga. Ono. You've gotta
stop Kenge and the hyenas.

13:15.095 --> 13:16.261
No problem, Kion.

13:16.296 --> 13:19.164
They'll be sorry they
ever left the Outlands.

13:19.199 --> 13:21.299
(STAMMERS)
But, you mean, just us?

13:21.334 --> 13:24.068
Sure! We've got
brains and bravery!

13:24.104 --> 13:25.170
What more do we need?

13:25.205 --> 13:27.405
Hmm. I guess
there's no other choice.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.340
Till the Pride Lands end...

13:29.376 --> 13:31.342
BUNGA: Lion Guard defend!

13:33.180 --> 13:36.381
Remember, this time
we gotta take all the melons.

13:36.416 --> 13:39.117
Then the elephants
won't have nothin' to drink

13:39.152 --> 13:41.352
when their
watering holes go dry.

13:41.388 --> 13:44.088
(CACKLING)

13:44.124 --> 13:45.123
Hey, lizard!

13:45.158 --> 13:47.125
You wanna give us
a little help here or what?

13:47.160 --> 13:48.159
Little?

13:48.228 --> 13:49.360
(SNARLING)

13:49.396 --> 13:53.231
Okay, how 'bout
some big help then?

13:53.266 --> 13:56.000
You think you're
in charge here?

13:56.036 --> 13:59.037
Me? Uh, maybe?

13:59.072 --> 14:01.206
But, uh, maybe not.

14:02.242 --> 14:05.076
Janja! You say
that all the time!

14:05.111 --> 14:06.144
Yeah!

14:06.179 --> 14:09.080
BOTH: "I'm in charge!
I'm in charge!"

14:09.115 --> 14:11.115
Maybe you're
in charge of them.

14:11.151 --> 14:14.085
But you're not
in charge of me!

14:14.120 --> 14:15.987
(SNARLS)

14:16.022 --> 14:18.256
Now we start rolling!

14:18.291 --> 14:19.290
Yeah, yeah.

14:19.326 --> 14:21.092
Okay!
Sure!

14:21.127 --> 14:23.328
My venom won't stall
the Lion Guard forever.

14:23.363 --> 14:26.364
We'll need to get
to the Outlands before
they recover!

14:27.267 --> 14:29.100
Too late for that, lizard.

14:29.135 --> 14:32.136
The Lion Guard's already
here to stop you!

14:32.172 --> 14:33.371
What Lion Guard?

14:33.406 --> 14:37.108
Most of you
ain't even here,
thanks to Kenge.

14:37.143 --> 14:39.377
Uh, the very big Kenge!

14:39.412 --> 14:41.179
That's right.

14:41.214 --> 14:44.015
You two can't
possibly stop us.

That was the plan.

16:20.246 --> 16:22.246

those Ponya flowers.

to smell the flowers?

the bad news is.

Well, I think these
Ponya flowers are

feel better. Right, guys?

Uh, sure.

kind of got away.

Unfortunately, yes.

the melons to the Outlands!

gonna do, Kion?

the elephants won't
survive the dry season!

the hyenas taking
to the Outlands?

toward Embamba Canyon.

narrow pass.

it'll work.

(HYENAS GRUNTING)

19:57.030 --> 19:59.130
How ya gonna bite me if
you can't even catch me?

19:59.165 --> 20:02.066
Ow! What'd I do?

20:02.101 --> 20:03.301
(GROANS)

20:03.336 --> 20:05.269
What's the matter,
little lizard?

20:05.305 --> 20:07.371
Can't tell a hyena
from a honey badger?

20:09.042 --> 20:11.275
(YELLS) Gee, I guess he can't.

20:13.279 --> 20:16.080
Hey, hey, hey!
Leave me out of this!

20:16.115 --> 20:18.349
See? I knew you couldn't
catch me... Huh?

20:18.384 --> 20:20.051
(STRUGGLING)

20:20.086 --> 20:22.220
Don't make me use
my stink on you, Janja!

20:22.255 --> 20:25.122
This time I'm not
just gonna bite you,

20:25.158 --> 20:27.158
little honey badger.

20:27.193 --> 20:29.126
I'm gonna eat you too!

20:31.064 --> 20:32.330
(GASPS)
(LAUGHING)

20:32.365 --> 20:34.332
Oh, this ain't fair!

20:35.368 --> 20:37.368
Who threw that melon?

20:38.238 --> 20:39.437
You!

20:39.472 --> 20:42.340
Uh, get away,
lizard! (GRUNTS)

20:42.375 --> 20:44.075
(GRUNTS)

20:44.110 --> 20:46.444
(SIGHS) There goes
another staff.

20:46.479 --> 20:48.446
Bunga, hurry!

20:48.481 --> 20:50.381
Now, Kion! Now!

20:50.416 --> 20:52.116
What?

20:52.151 --> 20:54.151
CHEEZI: The Lion Guard?

20:54.187 --> 20:58.990
Uh, Janja?
Ain't you gonna tell us
to "Run, fur-brains"?

20:59.025 --> 21:01.292
If we could, I would.

21:01.327 --> 21:03.327
Time to go home, Kenge!

21:04.130 --> 21:05.196
(ROARING)

21:05.231 --> 21:07.131
ALL: Whoa!

21:10.403 --> 21:12.236
And stay out!

21:12.272 --> 21:14.939
Yeah!

21:14.974 --> 21:19.310
<i> Poa!</i> Kion, your roar
blew them all the way
back to the Outlands!

21:19.345 --> 21:22.013
Now let's make sure
the melons are safe!

21:23.416 --> 21:26.417
Kion, that was
un-Bunga-lievable!

21:26.452 --> 21:30.054
Your legs
are working again!
The flowers helped!

21:30.089 --> 21:32.123
They sure did, Makini.
They healed us.

21:32.158 --> 21:33.224
You healed us.

21:33.259 --> 21:36.127
Yay! I wish I knew
how I did that.

21:36.162 --> 21:39.297
What about the melons?
Bunga, are they okay?

21:39.332 --> 21:41.132
Sure are!

21:41.167 --> 21:44.201
Now the elephants will have
enough water to make it
through the dry season.

21:44.270 --> 21:45.269
Come on, everyone.

21:45.305 --> 21:49.073
Let's get the melons
back to the patch.

21:49.108 --> 21:51.175
BUNGA: I sure am glad
you all can move again.

21:51.210 --> 21:54.345
Taking on Kenge and the hyenas
by myself is one thing,

21:54.380 --> 21:56.180
but movin'
all these melons?

21:56.215 --> 21:57.315
That's hard work!

21:57.350 --> 21:59.350
(ALL LAUGH)
