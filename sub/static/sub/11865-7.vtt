01:08.103 --> 01:10.919
I know there are billions of stars in the sky,

01:12.334 --> 01:13.914
and they're all twinkling.

01:15.594 --> 01:19.050
I wonder what makes one star more important than another?

01:20.514 --> 01:23.981
I mean, why does one star become part of the big dipper,

01:24.247 --> 01:26.785
and another just flame out?

01:27.456 --> 01:28.102
Wow.

01:29.413 --> 01:30.609
See that shooting star?

01:33.969 --> 01:35.106
My name's Vance.

01:36.136 --> 01:37.881
You told me that already.

01:38.694 --> 01:39.530
Right.

01:40.132 --> 01:42.199
I'm just a little nervous tonight.

01:42.573 --> 01:43.535
You should be.

01:47.828 --> 01:48.932
Is that me?

01:50.722 --> 01:51.617
Shit!

01:52.739 --> 01:54.301
I only took one hit.

01:56.041 --> 01:57.296
How stupid is that?

01:57.804 --> 01:59.990
Well, they don't call it dope for nothing.

02:01.198 --> 02:03.496
So... what happens next?

02:04.433 --> 02:05.330
Do I go up there?

02:06.117 --> 02:08.453
You're asking the wrong girl.

02:09.329 --> 02:12.104
Some people believe there's something bigger out there...

02:13.885 --> 02:16.117
that there's something protecting us,

02:17.173 --> 02:19.384
watching over us as we change.

02:24.434 --> 02:28.375
I guess it's comforting to think that someone is looking in on us.

02:32.297 --> 02:34.012
Reggie. Reggie, let's go.

02:36.255 --> 02:38.379
Come on, come on. Hurry up.

02:43.853 --> 02:46.377
- Where are we going?
- Just be quiet. Just get in the car.

02:46.464 --> 02:47.212
Morning!

02:48.747 --> 02:50.441
Sorry. We--we wake you up?

02:51.676 --> 02:53.406
What are you doing on my house?

02:53.458 --> 02:55.835
Don't mind her, Hank.

02:56.013 --> 02:58.301
Last to rise, first to worry.

02:58.384 --> 03:00.369
Mother! What are you doing?

03:00.806 --> 03:02.956
Joy, dear, did you honestly think

03:03.007 --> 03:06.013
that I was just going to write you a check for fixing this roof

03:06.068 --> 03:08.271
without looking at it myself first?

03:08.429 --> 03:11.782
I always warned you this house is in lousy shape.

03:11.855 --> 03:14.516
No, you actually used to say that about my marriage.

03:14.604 --> 03:17.082
You see? Right on both counts.

03:17.763 --> 03:20.896
- Hi, Reggie!
- Hi, grandma.

03:21.126 --> 03:24.087
Come on-- Hank, would you mind putting the bags over there?

03:24.132 --> 03:25.126
- Sure.
- Thanks.

03:27.429 --> 03:28.280
Well...

03:29.428 --> 03:33.415
That man has the most amazing hindquarters.

03:36.399 --> 03:38.597
Reggie, you need to, uh, go get ready for school.

03:38.658 --> 03:40.891
Oh, relax, Joy. We're all women here.

03:42.303 --> 03:43.456
I mean it, Reggie.

03:44.725 --> 03:47.689
Clancy had such a flat ass.

03:47.914 --> 03:50.146
You really can't trust a man with a flat ass.

03:50.322 --> 03:50.966
Mom.

03:51.125 --> 03:55.596
Nothing to hold on to. You know who has the best ass?

03:55.979 --> 03:58.520
Derek jeter.  Tch-ka, tch-ka, tch-ka.

03:59.317 --> 04:02.686
You--you--this-- you can't be here.

04:02.768 --> 04:04.790
The thing is, joy, I am here.

04:04.837 --> 04:07.807
I should've been here before, but I was respecting your wishes.

04:07.868 --> 04:11.048
So, at the end of the day, what has that accomplished?

04:11.186 --> 04:12.425
You not being here.

04:12.594 --> 04:14.428
Oh. Oh...

04:17.401 --> 04:18.721
Here's the estimate for the roof.

04:19.249 --> 04:21.410
- Thanks, Hank.
- Don't mention it, Phyllis.

04:25.413 --> 04:27.520
I have an estimate!

04:27.626 --> 04:32.060
And I'm sure it's twice as much as what Hank is going to charge you.

04:32.152 --> 04:36.022
Face it, Joy. You never liked to get your hands dirty.

04:36.386 --> 04:41.700
Whereas these hands... they love the dirt.

04:48.316 --> 04:50.646
Some repairs, you can get an estimate for...

04:54.299 --> 04:55.558
and some repairs,

04:56.691 --> 04:58.321
you can't put a price on.

05:00.917 --> 05:03.487
People always say, "you can't take it with you."

05:05.238 --> 05:09.672
But try dying and then coming back, see if you don't try to hold onto something...

05:11.961 --> 05:13.748
something important.

05:16.723 --> 05:19.364
"Where I sit, thou hast no right to stand."

05:19.554 --> 05:20.763
That doesn't make sense.

05:20.932 --> 05:22.969
Why would I want to stand where you sit?

05:23.024 --> 05:26.302
So Moses just told Death to get lost, and Death just went?

05:26.373 --> 05:28.401
That's some freeze-dried bullshit, Daisy.

05:28.465 --> 05:31.462
Yeah, I can't see Death giving up that easily.

05:31.524 --> 05:32.936
I don't care if it's Ghandi.

05:32.999 --> 05:36.393
If I have a post-it, I'm taking his bony brown butt out.

05:36.459 --> 05:37.980
See, Death didn't actually take Moses.

05:38.036 --> 05:39.127
God kissed him.

05:39.777 --> 05:42.875
- God kissed moses?
- Mm-hmm, when it was his time,

05:42.999 --> 05:46.232
God kissed him, and that's how he went. It's beautiful.

05:46.300 --> 05:48.804
Did you get to the part where God hates Death

05:48.922 --> 05:51.053
and promises he'll banish us from heaven?

05:51.744 --> 05:52.495
May I?

06:01.119 --> 06:03.114
There's no place for you in here, sweetness.

06:06.908 --> 06:08.159
I don't know what this is.

06:08.221 --> 06:09.688
I don't understand why I don't get this one.

06:09.745 --> 06:12.074
Say what you want about my beliefs, but I'm professional.

06:12.126 --> 06:13.744
I'm punctual and I get the job done.

06:13.796 --> 06:16.099
That's it, Rube. That's the last goddamn straw.

06:16.135 --> 06:18.072
This is fucking bullshit, that's what it is.

06:18.111 --> 06:19.438
She's just a kid, Rube.

06:19.495 --> 06:20.595
She can't handle it.

06:20.662 --> 06:22.545
Fuck that! I can handle this.

06:23.487 --> 06:24.097
What is it?

06:24.153 --> 06:27.148
No offense, Georgie girl, but how long have you been in this business?

06:27.215 --> 06:30.129
A fucking year at the most? I mean, I've worked my fucking-- worked--

06:30.333 --> 06:31.920
It's not a negotiation.

06:32.878 --> 06:34.040
George has got the letter.

06:34.106 --> 06:35.176
All these fireworks?

06:35.243 --> 06:38.939
Let's just assume that's already happened and help our young friend with her situation.

06:39.031 --> 06:39.815
Thank  you.

06:41.250 --> 06:42.483
What's my situation?

06:42.550 --> 06:45.867
- V.I.P.R.
- "Very important person reap."

06:45.929 --> 06:47.543
I.D.G.I.

06:49.421 --> 06:50.460
"I  don't get it."

06:50.512 --> 06:51.633
Open it already.

06:56.422 --> 06:57.511
Did I win a prize?

06:57.951 --> 06:58.734
Keep going.

07:01.167 --> 07:02.344
K. Lowerdeck?

07:02.426 --> 07:04.095
Kyle lowerdeck, the singer?

07:04.233 --> 07:07.669
Come on! This has got to be some unholy fucking mess-up,

07:07.725 --> 07:10.475
because this is my reap. I was born to do this reap.

07:10.552 --> 07:16.009
I was put on this Earth, and in this place, der the waffle haus, to fucking do this reap.

07:22.562 --> 07:23.731
Please don't.

07:24.909 --> 07:26.675
I was born to be a rock star.

07:27.396 --> 07:28.410
If I could sing.

07:31.077 --> 07:32.270
He's cute.

07:32.533 --> 07:35.487
He's not as cute as my first V.I.P.R.-- James dean.

07:35.953 --> 07:40.284
Beautiful Porsche. These really delicate lips. But he was so confused.

07:40.331 --> 07:43.150
- Did he try to nail you?
- No. I don't know why.

07:43.340 --> 07:44.149
I do.

07:46.060 --> 07:46.750
You.

07:47.953 --> 07:48.747
And you.

07:49.863 --> 07:50.687
Fine.

07:51.010 --> 07:55.378
Okay... why don't you just get a big lead pole, and stick it right up my ass?

07:55.455 --> 07:57.687
Same location, different reap.

07:57.814 --> 07:59.233
You got sloppy seconds.

07:59.510 --> 08:04.107
I'm going to be calm. Why does she get the cool reap?

08:04.185 --> 08:05.557
Probably because you're a fuck-up.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.741
Congratulations, Georgia.

08:08.808 --> 08:11.029
You've arrived. Excuse me.

08:14.133 --> 08:17.578
I could've been James Dean, you know, if I could act... or drive.

08:17.988 --> 08:20.477
- You up for this?
- Yeah, sure, why not?

08:20.527 --> 08:21.833
She's going to fuck it up.

08:21.904 --> 08:24.798
Hey, someone thinks I'm doing a good job. Right?

08:25.856 --> 08:27.491
Am I right or am I right?

08:27.681 --> 08:29.769
Okay, rich girl, breakfast is on you.

08:30.644 --> 08:33.235
Roxy! Roxy. Oh...

08:35.306 --> 08:36.389
Listen, uh...

08:37.746 --> 08:40.193
- George is going to need help.
- She'll be fine.

08:42.571 --> 08:43.337
Well, uh...

08:43.602 --> 08:44.739
an event like that,

08:45.853 --> 08:47.715
probably going to have police security, right?

08:47.768 --> 08:48.852
You can stop right there.

08:48.938 --> 08:50.869
I'm not losing my job over this.

08:50.920 --> 08:53.587
In case you haven't noticed, I'm a police officer.

08:53.654 --> 08:54.761
I swore an oath.

08:54.801 --> 08:56.541
I don't care if you donated a kidney.

08:56.803 --> 08:57.827
What you are is a reaper.

08:57.884 --> 09:00.552
That's the job you're not going to lose, whether you want to or not.

09:01.190 --> 09:02.466
What if I say no?

09:02.588 --> 09:05.036
- Say no.
- No.

09:07.797 --> 09:10.310
All right, Reggie gets out of school at 2:30,

09:10.669 --> 09:13.085
so if you're really going to do this, I need to have--

09:14.872 --> 09:16.519
Oh, god.

09:17.120 --> 09:19.244
You know, mom, you can't take care of Reggie

09:19.306 --> 09:22.347
and channel Hiawatha at the same time.

09:23.351 --> 09:25.757
Reggie isn't ready for your...

09:26.095 --> 09:27.953
version of the healing process.

09:28.015 --> 09:30.687
Reggie is old enough to make her own decisions.

09:30.785 --> 09:32.530
No, mother, she's not.

09:32.592 --> 09:34.271
All right? She's 11.

09:34.681 --> 09:39.550
"The path of care is the one we carve for ourselves."

09:40.241 --> 09:42.082
You've been saying that for as long as I've worn a bra,

09:42.183 --> 09:43.636
and I still have no clue what it means.

09:43.703 --> 09:48.561
Just, please, leave Reggie out of... your hocus pocus.

09:49.078 --> 09:53.176
Rules are the first step toward tyranny of the soul.

09:54.951 --> 09:56.216
You're right.

09:56.282 --> 10:00.327
The rules are just getting in the way. Ah, that's good.

10:00.440 --> 10:03.404
Reggie, you know all that stuff about going to school

10:03.476 --> 10:05.586
and brushing your teeth, not talking to strangers?

10:05.637 --> 10:07.019
Just forget about all that, okay?

10:07.074 --> 10:08.268
You can just do whatever you want.

10:08.335 --> 10:09.692
Do you need some money for drugs?

10:10.239 --> 10:11.755
Why are you such a freak?

10:12.119 --> 10:13.276
Ask your grandmother.

10:15.585 --> 10:16.681
Where's she going?

10:16.819 --> 10:17.853
I don't know.

10:18.463 --> 10:21.273
Your mother was never very good about sharing.

10:22.446 --> 10:23.777
You have to take me to school.

10:23.834 --> 10:26.660
Oh, you're not going to school today.

10:27.433 --> 10:28.631
What am I doing?

10:29.147 --> 10:30.454
Can you keep a secret?

10:31.048 --> 10:32.475
I had a secret...

10:34.263 --> 10:37.003
I  had a date with a rock star...

10:38.707 --> 10:40.422
and nobody knew.

10:41.787 --> 10:44.559
Well, well so I can die easy

10:44.601 --> 10:46.347
jesus gonna make up

10:46.413 --> 10:47.954
jesus gonna make up

10:48.047 --> 10:51.764
sweet jesus gonna make up my dying bed

10:51.859 --> 10:53.534
Holy smoke! What the fuck?

10:53.925 --> 10:54.671
Sorry!

10:55.419 --> 11:00.759
Lord, in my time of dying don't want nobody to cry...

11:01.153 --> 11:01.974
What are you doing?

11:02.055 --> 11:05.612
It's Lowerdeck, from "lowerdeck"-- "in all his glory."

11:05.921 --> 11:07.061
Oh, you're a fan?

11:07.148 --> 11:09.150
Oh, I'm a fan. I'm a big fan.

11:11.384 --> 11:13.227
Oh, Misty, please don't.

11:13.318 --> 11:16.293
- Do you have any?
- I, uh... no.

11:16.493 --> 11:19.468
Millie, um, I was wondering if you could--

11:21.470 --> 11:22.919
Excuse me.

11:25.560 --> 11:26.728
Are you watching tonight?

11:26.856 --> 11:28.233
It's going to be totally live.

11:28.320 --> 11:30.686
I know. I'm... going.

11:30.854 --> 11:33.374
It's impossible. It's like one of those unplugged sessions.

11:33.824 --> 11:34.940
No one gets in.

11:35.719 --> 11:37.603
Well, I guess I'm lucky.

11:37.670 --> 11:40.174
You're going to be near him, and now I'm near you.

11:40.962 --> 11:43.056
It's no big deal, really. I--  oh!

11:55.049 --> 11:59.936
- I'm not a lesbian.
- Millie, we've all experimented.

12:00.009 --> 12:04.370
-  You--I haven't.
- It's not as if I didn't go to college.

12:04.416 --> 12:08.304
- We've all put our big toe in that water.
- I really haven't.

12:12.509 --> 12:13.484
Delores?

12:18.409 --> 12:20.761
You know, when you're young like you are, Millie,

12:21.216 --> 12:22.025
it's easy.

12:22.894 --> 12:25.306
Man, woman, bottom, top...

12:25.367 --> 12:29.474
sex is this big buffet, and you're just a fat man with a fork,

12:29.547 --> 12:31.235
but as you get older,

12:31.825 --> 12:33.510
it's harder to get a fork.

12:36.448 --> 12:37.482
Okay. Thanks.

12:37.580 --> 12:40.728
Um, I have to leave early today.

12:40.938 --> 12:42.705
- Another doctor's appointment?
- No.

12:42.757 --> 12:44.024
- A.A. Meeting?
- No.

12:44.379 --> 12:46.370
- What, then?
- A rock concert.

12:49.574 --> 12:53.672
- Enjoy the buffet, Millie.
- Yeah. Okay, thanks. Bye.

12:57.461 --> 13:01.132
I'd like to get a ticket for the Kyle Lowerdeck concert.

13:01.361 --> 13:02.361
Sold out.

13:04.577 --> 13:06.180
I have $500?

13:06.241 --> 13:08.502
Oh, well, in that case... sold out.

13:09.886 --> 13:10.911
Asshole.

13:13.199 --> 13:14.752
That sensation you're feeling...

13:14.803 --> 13:17.179
wouldn't be the sensation of utter failure, would it?

13:17.234 --> 13:19.507
- What are you doing here?
- I've come to save your ass.

13:19.753 --> 13:20.807
Let's go to the concert.

13:20.890 --> 13:22.861
- You scored tickets?
- No.

13:23.275 --> 13:26.624
Then I'm screwed! Seriously, I'm royally fucked.

13:26.706 --> 13:28.954
Roxy's downstairs. Police escort.

13:29.225 --> 13:30.274
C ool.

13:46.228 --> 13:47.949
- Those are mom's.
- I know.

13:48.712 --> 13:50.600
Do you ever look at these when she's not home?

13:53.140 --> 13:54.964
It's all right to be curious, Reggie.

13:55.310 --> 13:57.452
Death is the biggest mystery in life.

13:57.518 --> 13:59.899
I'd be worried about you if you weren't curious.

14:04.964 --> 14:06.816
Have you ever been to that place, Reggie?

14:07.216 --> 14:08.768
That place where George died?

14:09.069 --> 14:12.054
It's an important place in her life.

14:12.121 --> 14:14.794
It should be an important place in yours, too.

14:17.856 --> 14:18.782
I know.

14:19.294 --> 14:24.348
We have to find the things and the places that keep George alive.

14:24.420 --> 14:25.397
They're everywhere.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.394
Her--her spirit...

14:28.142 --> 14:31.378
it's all around us.

14:35.556 --> 14:38.766
Sometimes... I hear things.

14:40.696 --> 14:42.462
Me, too.

14:44.874 --> 14:46.897
Me, too.

14:50.102 --> 14:52.098
Are these all of your cool tops?

14:52.258 --> 14:54.296
Some of them are dirty. You want to see those?

14:54.433 --> 14:57.414
I loved riding in the front seat of that police cruiser.

14:57.473 --> 14:59.261
It was my first time without handcuffs.

14:59.491 --> 15:00.899
It's a day of firsts.

15:04.284 --> 15:05.252
This is cute.

15:05.656 --> 15:08.477
- Is this blood?
- No. Brain.

15:08.549 --> 15:11.431
Last Tuesday, that guy who took the shotgun to the face.

15:11.631 --> 15:15.292
Daisy swore she could get it out. Promises, promises.

15:15.375 --> 15:18.108
I also loved the fact you were in the back seat, George.

15:18.230 --> 15:19.593
You looked just like a perp.

15:20.343 --> 15:24.841
You are just so pissed off that I got a rock star and you didn't.

15:24.892 --> 15:26.356
You just wish you were me, don't you?

15:26.429 --> 15:28.098
She's a cocky little thing, isn't she?

15:28.194 --> 15:30.627
I'm not cocky. I'm just cooler than you are.

15:30.785 --> 15:32.905
I got a rock'n'roll reap.

15:32.997 --> 15:33.776
Up yours.

15:33.878 --> 15:35.127
There's nothing to wear to it.

15:35.204 --> 15:38.153
My only V.I.P. Reap was Charlton Heston.

15:38.210 --> 15:40.626
- He isn't dead.
- Yeah, but isn't he really?

15:40.698 --> 15:43.570
Did rube get a lot of big reaps? I bet he has.

15:43.646 --> 15:45.602
Rube is so fucking old, he reaped Jesus.

15:46.161 --> 15:48.854
Come on, guys, I don't see what these clothes have got to do

15:48.916 --> 15:51.050
with getting tickets to the fucking rock concert.

15:51.229 --> 15:52.423
George is a girl.

15:52.494 --> 15:54.353
Looking good is her ticket.

15:54.507 --> 15:57.047
You have a police badge and a bloody gun!

15:57.118 --> 15:59.099
And George is young and cute.

16:00.472 --> 16:01.982
Are these all your tops?

16:02.090 --> 16:04.264
Hey, a dead girl has got to make do with very little.

16:04.327 --> 16:06.733
I need something racy and clingy.

16:06.806 --> 16:09.604
- You still got that $500?
- Most of it.

16:09.673 --> 16:11.996
- Ooh, are we going to go scalping?
- Shopping.

16:12.098 --> 16:13.875
- And you're on your own.
- What?

16:13.943 --> 16:16.677
I don't like your fucking attitude. You're on your own.

16:16.743 --> 16:18.120
You're joking! What?

16:18.827 --> 16:20.701
No, but-- well, I'm just--

16:20.752 --> 16:24.321
Do you twon think I really need you to get into a rock'n'roll establishment?

16:24.955 --> 16:26.005
No, I don't.

16:26.445 --> 16:28.826
I was born in a rock'n'roll establishment.

16:29.923 --> 16:31.110
I actually was.

16:31.606 --> 16:33.255
Behind the amps, backstage.

16:34.259 --> 16:35.260
Roxy?

16:38.436 --> 16:40.448
I'm so viciously fucked.

16:55.082 --> 16:58.563
- Father Matthias?
- Confession is closed.

16:58.968 --> 17:00.428
I know, I just...

17:02.234 --> 17:04.063
Well, it's occupied anyway.

17:04.113 --> 17:07.564
A boy and a girl are actually desecrating the confessional.

17:09.710 --> 17:12.429
They are fruitful and multiplying...

17:15.101 --> 17:16.719
Are you drunk, father?

17:17.026 --> 17:19.683
I'm sorry. I'm not being a very good priest.

17:19.765 --> 17:21.183
No, you certainly aren't.

17:22.071 --> 17:23.016
I know you.

17:23.713 --> 17:26.145
Were you here for confession a couple of weeks ago?

17:26.830 --> 17:27.928
I was.

17:28.239 --> 17:31.092
Were you the one who stole a cross from a dead woman?

17:31.680 --> 17:33.964
Well, if you want to put it that way, fine.

17:44.736 --> 17:47.030
- It's very beautiful.
- Thank you.

17:49.769 --> 17:50.854
So are you.

17:51.407 --> 17:52.365
Father...

17:53.066 --> 17:54.391
tsk, tsk.

17:54.714 --> 17:56.065
Well, I've done the drinking.

17:56.553 --> 17:58.227
And the coveting, that's a given.

17:58.468 --> 17:59.846
But that's where I stop.

18:03.654 --> 18:04.596
What's your name?

18:05.506 --> 18:06.614
Daisy adair.

18:07.028 --> 18:08.678
My parish is poor.

18:09.220 --> 18:11.258
I've spent a lifetime trying to

18:11.463 --> 18:13.204
bring hope to the hopeless,

18:13.455 --> 18:16.536
convincing them that there's some great reward ahead.

18:17.366 --> 18:20.330
I worry about the hearts of men, Daisy.

18:20.857 --> 18:21.912
So do I.

18:25.130 --> 18:29.614
Would you like to know the secrets of the universe, Daisy?

18:37.485 --> 18:38.655
We are born.

18:40.244 --> 18:41.594
We die.

18:43.007 --> 18:44.031
We rot.

18:51.556 --> 18:53.933
It's all one big cosmic joke!

19:20.858 --> 19:22.084
Oh, my lord...

19:34.423 --> 19:36.025
I'm with the band, mate. Cheers.

19:36.686 --> 19:38.872
Uh, excuse me, hello. I'm with the band.

19:39.241 --> 19:40.542
Why don't you understand me?

19:40.602 --> 19:42.762
I'm... with... the... band.

19:43.429 --> 19:45.024
What do you think Kyle's going to say when he says,

19:45.125 --> 19:46.726
"where's my bloody guitar?"

19:46.792 --> 19:50.572
And I say, "the fat bloody security person held me up at the gate"?

19:51.350 --> 19:53.547
All right. I'm friends with the drummer.

19:53.788 --> 19:54.800
What's the drummer's name?

19:55.353 --> 19:57.472
I call him by his nickname, you know, Sticks.

19:57.566 --> 19:58.481
Hit the road, Jack.

19:58.656 --> 19:59.921
Roxy, thank god, man.

20:00.029 --> 20:01.984
Fucking--you don't know what I've been through here.

20:02.045 --> 20:03.956
I mean, in the good old days, you used to be able to just--

20:04.013 --> 20:05.809
- Sir, step aside.
- What?

20:05.866 --> 20:09.179
Sir, don't let me have to ask you again. Step aside.

20:09.240 --> 20:10.453
Don't pull this on me, Roxy.

20:10.715 --> 20:13.821
Don't--no, don't get your little friend to come over and arrest me or anything,

20:13.954 --> 20:15.296
because you're not going to--roxy!

20:15.357 --> 20:16.669
You have not heard the last of this!

20:16.781 --> 20:17.678
Don't I know it.

20:22.889 --> 20:23.974
She's with the band.

20:25.700 --> 20:27.435
Look, she's pretending not to know me!

20:27.677 --> 20:28.951
You're on your own, kid.

20:29.249 --> 20:30.523
Don't  fuck this up.

20:30.871 --> 20:32.362
Roxy, you're a bugger.

20:33.406 --> 20:35.496
You know that dream where you're sitting in class,

20:35.587 --> 20:37.507
and all of a sudden you realize you're naked?

20:37.814 --> 20:39.305
Well, I never had that dream.

20:43.037 --> 20:44.353
Until now.

20:47.773 --> 20:50.287
Hey, Don, get someone to clear the fucking step, hey?

20:50.958 --> 20:51.847
Are you all right?

20:52.258 --> 20:53.727
Someone's going to die around here.

20:54.291 --> 20:55.647
I think you're right.

20:56.631 --> 20:58.136
Hey, I'm Jeannie,

20:58.453 --> 20:59.795
and I'm going to get you a drink.

21:00.179 --> 21:03.061
I'm George, and I'm not going to argue.

21:04.417 --> 21:06.487
So I haven't seen you around here before.

21:07.040 --> 21:10.951
- I'm with the network.
- Oh. Cool. What do you do?

21:11.391 --> 21:15.360
Okay, you're supposed to be here, but have no responsibilities.

21:15.682 --> 21:17.408
I'm an... intern.

21:18.406 --> 21:19.276
Nice.

21:21.887 --> 21:25.404
- So have you met Kyle?
- Not yet.

21:25.595 --> 21:29.515
Well, two years ago, Kyle's biggest gig was his step-dad's garage.

21:29.696 --> 21:31.315
He was waiting tables at the daily grill,

21:31.396 --> 21:33.719
and this fucking agent finds him.

21:33.879 --> 21:36.706
She's a vampire. Really has fangs.

21:37.612 --> 21:40.258
Anyway, just like that, no one can get near him.

21:42.256 --> 21:43.658
No one can touch him.

21:44.125 --> 21:45.562
I need to touch him.

21:46.367 --> 21:49.312
Yeah, well, his new girlfriend will kill you first.

21:51.256 --> 21:53.130
I'm going to touch him tonight.

21:53.504 --> 21:54.795
Yeah, well, George,

21:55.153 --> 21:56.595
live hard, die young,

21:56.776 --> 21:58.359
leave a fucking beautiful corpse.

21:58.416 --> 21:59.662
Amen to that, sister.

22:00.330 --> 22:02.316
"Amen to that, sister?"

22:02.998 --> 22:03.740
One more.

22:03.996 --> 22:06.412
Just like that, I was a rocker chick.

22:06.883 --> 22:07.595
Cheers.

22:12.427 --> 22:13.330
Excuse me.

22:14.175 --> 22:15.076
Yoo-hoo.

22:17.215 --> 22:18.005
The thing is,

22:18.175 --> 22:19.652
I've got this little package for Kyle,

22:19.714 --> 22:21.101
you know, it's a performance enhancer.

22:21.157 --> 22:22.927
If you're lucky, you can get a bit on the side--

22:24.683 --> 22:27.460
I've been clean 15 years, lowlife.

22:27.803 --> 22:28.576
Fuck you.

22:28.915 --> 22:30.491
You're going to be hearing from my bloody lawyer.

22:30.533 --> 22:31.566
Do you know what I mean?

22:31.607 --> 22:33.012
I mean, that's going to cost you, big time.

22:33.052 --> 22:35.304
If you give me 50 bucks now, we'll forget about the whole thing.

22:35.458 --> 22:36.780
How much to break both your legs?

22:48.282 --> 22:50.497
Oh, come on! This isn't rock'n'roll.

22:57.998 --> 22:59.543
What do you smell like?

23:00.367 --> 23:00.919
Uh...

23:02.431 --> 23:05.524
Oh, come on, since when does a man need to shower to be rock and roll, eh?

23:06.542 --> 23:08.144
You smell like death.

23:08.901 --> 23:12.169
You are not exactly a bouquet of fucking roses either, love, all right?

23:25.755 --> 23:26.678
Oh, fuck off.

23:29.422 --> 23:31.396
- Have a good evening, sir.
- Huh?

23:34.386 --> 23:35.470
Sweet!

23:46.118 --> 23:47.737
Oh, mama, I'm home.

23:48.967 --> 23:49.587
Come on.

23:50.425 --> 23:51.802
Bandar wants to meet you.

23:52.325 --> 23:53.820
- What's your name?
- Mason.

23:55.049 --> 23:59.535
When Kyle used to play, it was like... a happening, you know?

23:59.704 --> 24:02.274
None of this manufactured crap.

24:02.776 --> 24:05.775
Wherever he played, people would just hear about it and come,

24:05.961 --> 24:06.969
you know what I'm saying?

24:07.107 --> 24:07.794
Sure.

24:08.596 --> 24:10.434
Well, it's not like that anymore.

24:10.564 --> 24:12.180
It used to be all about rock.

24:12.299 --> 24:14.091
Now it's all about the rock star.

24:14.193 --> 24:16.348
Yeah, um, can you introduce me now?

24:16.790 --> 24:21.126
Mm, I think there're a few other people who want to meet you first.

24:23.306 --> 24:24.213
What's their deal?

24:24.510 --> 24:27.531
I believe the deal is that you're hot.

24:28.235 --> 24:30.444
- I am?
- Yeah.

24:30.550 --> 24:31.889
You're actually Kyle's type.

24:31.935 --> 24:34.065
You know, that effortless cool look.

24:34.156 --> 24:37.059
Although, you could use a little lip gloss.

24:39.194 --> 24:40.177
Do me.

24:46.132 --> 24:47.443
Yeah, you wish, dude.

24:49.333 --> 24:51.313
What the hell do they think?

24:51.902 --> 24:53.944
- Let's go check out the buffet.
- Okay.

24:56.935 --> 24:59.608
I died in 1938.

25:00.295 --> 25:04.727
Which interrupted a very promising career on the silver screen.

25:06.110 --> 25:09.623
So now I stay here, and I help other people go.

25:10.575 --> 25:13.596
And they do go somewhere, I know that much.

25:18.700 --> 25:21.107
I don't know if there's a heaven or a hell,

25:21.941 --> 25:25.929
but I believe there's more.

25:28.215 --> 25:29.622
My whole life...

25:29.693 --> 25:30.769
my whole death,

25:31.251 --> 25:33.630
shows me that there's more.

25:34.497 --> 25:36.186
I just don't know what it is.

25:37.545 --> 25:38.372
Thank you.

25:44.951 --> 25:46.451
You can't tell anyone.

25:48.214 --> 25:50.475
I have to, I have to tell them.

25:51.505 --> 25:52.509
Yeah.

25:53.796 --> 25:55.074
I know you do.

26:05.887 --> 26:07.986
Thank you for giving me back my faith.

26:18.826 --> 26:19.548
So...

26:21.110 --> 26:22.020
is it true?

26:22.261 --> 26:24.218
I don't know what the hell she's talking about, Band-aid,

26:24.274 --> 26:26.706
but I do want a bit more tequila. Do you know what I mean?

26:26.802 --> 26:28.364
It's Bandar, motherfucker.

26:28.580 --> 26:31.298
Look into his eyes. He's dead.

26:31.775 --> 26:33.244
You're dead, right?

26:33.571 --> 26:35.655
No, man, I'm deathly attracted to you.

26:35.707 --> 26:38.497
I'm dead on arrival at your doorstep. I'm dead serious.

26:40.579 --> 26:42.834
Don't you get it? You're with friends now.

26:42.889 --> 26:47.328
Just answer the question. Are you dead?

26:49.157 --> 26:53.202
I was dead. And now I'm not.

26:54.529 --> 26:55.946
I'm a grim reaper.

26:58.123 --> 27:00.498
I take people's souls before they die.

27:01.972 --> 27:02.945
I knew it.

27:03.417 --> 27:05.285
What is it like to take someone's soul?

27:07.154 --> 27:10.749
All right, Bandar, you know when you're piss drunk,

27:11.229 --> 27:13.068
and you collapse on the floor,

27:13.230 --> 27:17.163
and someone comes to wake you up because the police are just about to arrive, yeah?

27:17.506 --> 27:18.796
Well, I'm that someone.

27:19.639 --> 27:21.367
And at first,

27:22.437 --> 27:25.140
they don't know where they are or who they are,

27:25.213 --> 27:27.019
and they're a little bit confused.

27:27.748 --> 27:30.040
Well, that's why I'm there, 'cause I'm there to...

27:31.012 --> 27:32.477
I'm there to reassure them.

27:32.523 --> 27:36.497
I'm there to make them believe everything's all right.

27:38.800 --> 27:39.841
To death.

27:42.088 --> 27:43.598
Ah... nice.

27:43.720 --> 27:44.705
To death.

27:44.873 --> 27:45.728
Tonight.

27:53.174 --> 27:53.916
Thank you.

27:55.277 --> 27:56.082
Thank you!

27:56.768 --> 27:58.540
Thank you. Thank you.

27:58.626 --> 28:01.099
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

28:03.976 --> 28:04.883
Who's there?

28:05.138 --> 28:06.966
Tommy Ryan,

28:07.067 --> 28:10.316
if that's you rmaking out with Cindy Stevens again in my confessional,

28:10.376 --> 28:11.871
there'll be hell to pay!

28:12.168 --> 28:15.082
Cindy stevens? You asshole!

28:19.255 --> 28:20.133
Afternoon.

28:21.369 --> 28:22.911
Uh, we were-- we were just--

28:22.976 --> 28:25.429
Don't lie, Tommy. Not on this day.

28:25.567 --> 28:29.536
This is a holy day, for I have seen something wonderful.

28:29.648 --> 28:31.839
Now, fall to your knees and ask for his forgiveness.

28:31.901 --> 28:32.679
Jesus, father!

28:32.741 --> 28:36.877
Do not use his name in vain! For he is real!

28:37.031 --> 28:39.408
Chill, father. You're freaking me out.

28:39.472 --> 28:40.216
Wait!

28:40.380 --> 28:44.101
Listen to me, I have seen something wonderful!

28:44.246 --> 28:45.823
Tommy! No, wait!

28:46.042 --> 28:48.536
Wait! Tommy! No, wait! Wait! Wait, I--

29:03.704 --> 29:04.720
So...

29:05.801 --> 29:07.300
is that all there is?

29:07.618 --> 29:08.407
No.

29:09.169 --> 29:10.537
This is only the start.

29:12.490 --> 29:13.481
Look.

29:26.537 --> 29:28.804
- Father?
- Yes?

29:29.400 --> 29:30.847
Is it all they say it is?

29:32.564 --> 29:34.595
I'm as curious as you are, Daisy.

29:49.815 --> 29:52.169
I know there's a much better place out there.

29:52.911 --> 29:55.538
If I could only figure out how to access it.

29:56.412 --> 29:58.451
The better place out there, in my mind?

29:59.623 --> 30:01.179
It's the V.I.P. Room.

30:01.630 --> 30:02.526
And tonight...

30:03.212 --> 30:05.040
I'm finally getting in.

30:11.726 --> 30:12.981
Ready to meet Kyle?

30:13.090 --> 30:14.988
Ready for your brush with immortality?

30:15.397 --> 30:17.516
Yeah, a brush sounds right about now.

30:17.589 --> 30:18.946
- Hey, Jeannie.
- Hey, Kyle.

30:19.365 --> 30:21.592
I saw your mom. She says hi.

30:21.911 --> 30:23.334
Oh. Thanks.

30:23.476 --> 30:26.032
Um, this is George. She's with the network.

30:26.626 --> 30:28.080
Actually, I'm an intern.

30:28.173 --> 30:29.130
Uh, Jenny...

30:29.601 --> 30:31.934
- It's Jeannie.
- Yeah.

30:32.043 --> 30:34.834
Kyle doesn't do meet-and-greets this close to performance.

30:34.982 --> 30:36.383
Please try to respect that.

30:38.899 --> 30:40.486
Oh...kay.

30:40.543 --> 30:42.965
She just totally rock-blocked us. That wasn't cool.

30:43.383 --> 30:44.551
Well, let's blow.

30:44.991 --> 30:46.399
I'm going to stick around a while.

30:46.523 --> 30:48.320
He's not really immortal, you know.

30:48.482 --> 30:51.472
You can touch him, but nothing's going to brush off on you.

30:53.035 --> 30:54.684
It's one thing to show up,

30:54.771 --> 30:57.249
take a soul, get on with your afterlife.

30:57.648 --> 31:00.515
You can think of yourself like some kind of...

31:00.961 --> 31:01.918
accident.

31:02.778 --> 31:05.625
But when you have to work at it, it feels more like...

31:06.625 --> 31:07.463
murder.

31:33.486 --> 31:35.082
Offer you a lift home?

31:37.256 --> 31:41.046
Why, Rube, is there a gentleman lurking underneath that cold demeanor?

31:46.727 --> 31:48.311
Where's your cross?

31:49.792 --> 31:51.706
He's a priest, for God's sake.

31:53.401 --> 31:57.124
I wanted golden trumpets and angels singing.

31:57.181 --> 31:59.717
I just expected it to be far more glamorous.

32:01.788 --> 32:05.720
There's a place in Bombay.

32:07.302 --> 32:09.483
It's called the tower of silence.

32:11.578 --> 32:15.822
When somebody dies, they have no more use for this body,

32:15.888 --> 32:18.335
for this vessel,

32:18.582 --> 32:21.177
so they put the body at the top of the tower

32:21.229 --> 32:23.563
and let the vultures have at it.

32:26.943 --> 32:28.759
Our endings, Daisy...

32:29.867 --> 32:31.351
they are what they are.

32:31.837 --> 32:32.564
Great.

32:38.569 --> 32:39.389
So?

32:42.610 --> 32:43.741
Find what you're looking for?

33:06.812 --> 33:08.696
I knew we'd find you here.

33:10.091 --> 33:11.026
What...

33:12.265 --> 33:13.437
what are you doing?

33:13.857 --> 33:17.144
I'm bringing Reggie to visit her sister.

33:18.579 --> 33:20.431
Reggie, did you even go to school today?

33:20.938 --> 33:22.005
The truth, Reggie.

33:27.106 --> 33:27.958
Mom.

33:28.748 --> 33:29.791
We did yoga.

33:30.712 --> 33:32.381
Oh. Good god.

33:33.493 --> 33:36.878
Mother, what color is the sky on your planet?

33:36.985 --> 33:39.499
It's a very bright blue.

33:41.091 --> 33:42.315
Oh, I can't...

33:42.479 --> 33:44.701
I can't do this right now.

33:44.853 --> 33:45.596
Reggie, let's go.

33:46.425 --> 33:49.764
I've never been here before. I want to stay.

33:50.317 --> 33:51.054
Reggie...

33:51.163 --> 33:54.260
She's never been here before, Joy.

33:56.303 --> 33:58.777
All right, fine. Let's be here.

34:17.214 --> 34:20.117
How do I become a reaper?

34:20.630 --> 34:21.534
How do you...

34:22.283 --> 34:23.699
Bandar, first of all,

34:23.761 --> 34:28.570
you have to experience the inconvenience of dying.

34:30.545 --> 34:31.683
I can do that.

34:35.428 --> 34:37.909
Don't you think this is a bit bloody morbid, though?

34:37.969 --> 34:41.202
It's like, I can promise you, death will find you.

34:42.001 --> 34:43.772
You don't have to invite it in.

34:44.268 --> 34:47.878
You're never more alive until you're closest to death.

34:48.195 --> 34:51.493
Very, very right.

34:51.768 --> 34:54.589
Oh, my goodness. Get off. Oh...

34:59.423 --> 35:01.850
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me

35:02.614 --> 35:05.767
meet me in the middle of the air

35:06.684 --> 35:09.873
if these wings should fail me lord,

35:09.940 --> 35:12.710
won't you meet me with another pair?

35:15.404 --> 35:16.779
That's all you guys get right now.

35:21.317 --> 35:22.924
Well, let's have a great night, guys.

35:23.047 --> 35:24.254
Maybe this is our time.

35:24.333 --> 35:25.577
Maybe this is our moment.

35:25.858 --> 35:27.251
Let's enjoy. Cheers.

35:27.345 --> 35:28.523
- All right!
- All right!

35:30.149 --> 35:31.373
It's always the same,

35:31.563 --> 35:33.159
whether it's asking someone out,

35:33.236 --> 35:35.704
jumping in the water, or losing your virginity.

35:36.144 --> 35:37.726
They always say the same thing:

35:38.063 --> 35:39.277
just do it.

35:39.902 --> 35:41.882
My very important problem was,

35:42.447 --> 35:45.238
I'd never done any of those very important things.

36:03.087 --> 36:04.161
Hi. I'm George.

36:05.703 --> 36:07.718
Hi. I'm Kyle.

36:08.032 --> 36:10.705
I was just, you know, taking a moment...

36:12.424 --> 36:14.606
Take as many as you can.

36:14.677 --> 36:15.840
You excited about tonight?

36:17.555 --> 36:19.865
- Mostly nervous.
- Me too.

36:20.198 --> 36:21.784
I mean, I don't want to disappoint them.

36:24.093 --> 36:26.975
I've never done a live concert on T.V. before.

36:33.795 --> 36:35.670
There's going to be a lot of people watching tonight.

36:35.793 --> 36:38.768
I don't know why, but for some reason, I've been picked to do this.

36:38.987 --> 36:41.629
It's crazy. It's way too much responsibility, you know?

36:42.126 --> 36:44.762
- You're going to be great. 
- Give me luck.

37:00.451 --> 37:03.978
You know what, guys, it has been such a treat, but I've got things to do.

37:04.081 --> 37:05.658
Okay, I'll see you around, all right?

37:06.231 --> 37:07.721
Wait. No. What is that?

37:07.772 --> 37:09.380
You have to give that back to me, all right?

37:11.771 --> 37:12.903
I'm going to die tonight.

37:15.125 --> 37:18.171
And you are going to take my soul.

37:25.668 --> 37:28.642
- What's your name?
- I am Bandar.

37:28.713 --> 37:30.945
Your real name, stupid asshole.

37:31.714 --> 37:35.922
It's Fred. It's Fred Swirsky.

37:51.180 --> 37:54.615
I'm fucking with you guys, man. I'm not a fucking grim reaper.

37:54.743 --> 37:57.186
Jesus christ. I don't know where this death wish comes in,

37:57.258 --> 37:58.369
but it's stupid.

37:58.511 --> 38:00.233
I don't think you know how stupid it is.

38:00.361 --> 38:02.044
You need to get a life, Fred.

38:02.142 --> 38:03.585
You all need to get some color.

38:03.653 --> 38:05.213
Maybe a little rouge around the cheeks.

38:05.270 --> 38:06.944
Some sunshine, all right?

38:07.027 --> 38:09.168
You, stay chalky. You're gorgeous.

38:12.772 --> 38:13.457
See you.

38:16.908 --> 38:18.353
Thank you very much, you guys.

38:18.691 --> 38:19.970
Thanks for coming out this evening.

38:28.246 --> 38:31.531
Now, in my time of dying

38:32.028 --> 38:34.798
I don't want nobody to mourn

38:35.863 --> 38:39.386
all I want my friends to do

38:39.427 --> 38:42.252
comin' for my dying arms

38:42.303 --> 38:43.890
well, well, well

38:43.932 --> 38:45.914
so I can die easy

38:45.980 --> 38:47.546
well, well, well

38:47.578 --> 38:49.539
so I can die young

38:49.667 --> 38:51.238
well, well, well

38:51.285 --> 38:53.271
So I can die easy

38:53.337 --> 38:55.201
Jesus gonna make up

38:55.258 --> 38:56.809
Jesus gonna make up

38:56.860 --> 38:58.566
Jesus gonna make up

38:58.616 --> 39:00.772
my dying bed--

39:12.425 --> 39:15.020
No, don't. Please.

39:21.759 --> 39:22.855
Wow.

39:26.711 --> 39:28.389
What's this girl's name? What is her name?

39:28.436 --> 39:29.639
Uh, Jeannie Bead.

39:30.253 --> 39:31.031
Fuck!

39:48.235 --> 39:50.554
Don't... don't touch me.

40:09.621 --> 40:12.728
- What's this?
- It's for you.

40:14.439 --> 40:15.412
Wow.

40:16.328 --> 40:19.173
- Does everyone get this?
- No.

40:19.671 --> 40:20.553
Did you get this?

40:21.809 --> 40:23.967
No, no lights for me.

40:24.802 --> 40:25.740
Not yet.

40:26.682 --> 40:28.780
Every day, I watch people die.

40:29.702 --> 40:32.155
Why one death means more than another,

40:32.245 --> 40:33.434
I have no idea.

40:48.568 --> 40:51.857
I think people need something familiar.

40:52.445 --> 40:53.362
Reggie?

40:54.679 --> 40:55.528
Mom?

40:56.137 --> 40:58.493
Something they can remember.

41:00.694 --> 41:02.276
Whatcha doing there, Reggie?

41:03.556 --> 41:05.783
Grandma's helping George with her bardo.

41:06.403 --> 41:07.606
Is that right?

41:07.795 --> 41:12.404
The bardo is the way the tibetans help the dead sort out reality.

41:12.501 --> 41:15.787
It's an ancient and respected ritual, Joy.

41:16.320 --> 41:19.541
Well, I brought another ancient and respected ritual.

41:20.016 --> 41:21.388
Chunky monkey.

41:22.578 --> 41:25.818
Reggie, why don't you go scoop us up a few bowls?

41:34.512 --> 41:37.716
You know, you're not the only one who's lost George.

41:38.633 --> 41:40.972
The whole world has lost a soul.

41:41.086 --> 41:42.867
She was my daughter.

41:43.830 --> 41:44.753
Mine.

41:46.417 --> 41:48.269
She was me, mom.

41:49.539 --> 41:52.800
The same way that you're me.

41:54.316 --> 41:55.724
And I miss you.

41:56.810 --> 41:58.811
Both of you.

42:09.319 --> 42:10.259
You see it out there?

42:11.028 --> 42:12.329
George did good.

42:15.432 --> 42:16.486
She did fine.

42:18.447 --> 42:19.599
What's going on, Rox?

42:22.425 --> 42:23.853
I had to shoot someone.

42:27.335 --> 42:28.472
Someone died.

42:29.486 --> 42:32.020
- Did your job.
- Mine and Mason's.

42:32.082 --> 42:33.208
I meant your other job...

42:33.858 --> 42:35.209
officer.

42:38.375 --> 42:39.960
I'm just stating a fact.

42:45.445 --> 42:46.771
Did somebody important die?

42:47.611 --> 42:48.999
Today, every day.

42:49.259 --> 42:50.540
What kind of pie you got tonight?

42:51.000 --> 42:51.874
It's pecan.

42:52.357 --> 42:55.767
I saved you a piece, for my very important customer.

43:04.635 --> 43:07.461
- George?
- Yeah, she did really well.

43:13.687 --> 43:15.514
I can't go in there tonight

43:16.502 --> 43:18.040
and face the boss man.

43:22.146 --> 43:23.539
Do me a favor and...

43:24.578 --> 43:27.317
tell him I'm piss drunk somewhere in the gutter.

43:39.534 --> 43:41.540
Don't make more of it than it is.

43:42.277 --> 43:43.132
I won't.

43:45.028 --> 43:46.593
Come on inside. I'm buying.

43:52.329 --> 43:55.507
Maybe it's easier to mourn someone you never really knew.

43:56.669 --> 43:58.124
I'm not sure I get it,

43:58.217 --> 43:59.839
all this shared pain...

44:03.326 --> 44:05.497
I guess it's a place to leave a sign,

44:07.790 --> 44:10.350
a way of saying that you lost someone, too.

44:11.856 --> 44:13.504
Everyone was connecting.

44:14.952 --> 44:17.207
Everyone, of course, except me.

44:18.220 --> 44:19.433
Okay, Rube, I blew it.

44:19.551 --> 44:21.400
I completely blew it, and believe me,

44:21.446 --> 44:25.680
I'm so painfully, painfully aware of my failures this evening,

44:26.413 --> 44:27.666
but, saying that,

44:27.703 --> 44:30.165
bring on more pain, because, no doubt, I deserve it, okay?

44:33.457 --> 44:34.353
Pecan.

44:35.685 --> 44:36.868
Not bad, either.

44:40.954 --> 44:43.957
Think of it as a get-out-of-jail-free card.

44:46.441 --> 44:48.925
- Nice shot, Roxy.
- Thanks.

44:49.003 --> 44:49.851
Here she is.

44:51.101 --> 44:54.747
Look at you! Nice going.

44:55.023 --> 44:59.088
Yeah, it was crazy in there.

44:59.170 --> 45:00.138
I like your outfit.

45:00.656 --> 45:03.879
Thank you, Daisy. Roxy picked it out.

45:05.803 --> 45:07.956
Ain't nothing but woman under this uniform.

45:09.540 --> 45:11.101
What the fuck you laughing at?

45:14.409 --> 45:16.876
Not every death gets a candlelight vigil.

45:22.510 --> 45:23.654
Most deaths,

45:24.275 --> 45:26.573
they just got a sky full of stars.

45:26.988 --> 45:28.258
That's not bad...

45:28.729 --> 45:31.100
for a nobody like me.

45:42.305 --> 45:48.291
