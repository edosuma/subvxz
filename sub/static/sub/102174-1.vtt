00:36.236 --> 00:38.238
<i>That's an expensive process.</i>

00:38.272 --> 00:40.542
<i>No one wants to hear
they're going to die.</i>

00:40.575 --> 00:44.111

available for the...</i>

01:30.892 --> 01:32.527
Okay, so I have
your prescription for you,

01:32.560 --> 01:36.664
- but I still have to see some sort of ID or insurance...
- I don't have it on me,

01:36.698 --> 01:37.865
but you know me.
I always come back.

01:37.899 --> 01:39.266
- Just let me take the medication.
- I'm happy to help,

01:39.299 --> 01:42.369
- but I just... I need to see something...
- I need my medication.

01:42.402 --> 01:43.538
I'll... I'll give you
my necklace.

01:43.571 --> 01:45.405
- No, we're happy to give it to you, sweetie...
- Look.

01:45.439 --> 01:46.741
- Why don't you just...
- Okay, I have...

01:46.774 --> 01:48.042
I'll give you my necklace.

01:48.076 --> 01:50.612
- I'll take half.
- Why don't you step to the side? We'll let him...

01:50.645 --> 01:52.179
You have everything.

01:52.212 --> 01:53.881
- Okay, um...
- Or fill...

01:53.915 --> 01:56.183
So we can't...
We can't accept this.

01:56.216 --> 01:57.451
Um, we're doing this again.

01:57.484 --> 02:00.688
So, the doctor signed this
for me. Luke Hart.

02:11.933 --> 02:13.768
Right.
No, I totally understand.

02:13.801 --> 02:16.203
- It's not about...
- Looks like you've changed the quantity.

02:16.236 --> 02:18.506
- Can I just give it to you?
- Why don't you give the doctor a call?

02:18.539 --> 02:20.474
- Why would I give the doctor a call...
- Get a valid...

02:20.508 --> 02:22.275
...when you are the pharmacists?

02:22.309 --> 02:23.778
- Come on.
- Okay, who's your doctor?

02:23.811 --> 02:26.246
- It's the same doctor. He's here every fucking week.
- Who's the doctor?

02:26.279 --> 02:28.315
I swear...

02:38.559 --> 02:40.260
...so this time...

02:40.293 --> 02:42.462
It's just...

02:42.496 --> 02:44.899
- You've got to come back.
- Yeah, come back.

02:47.869 --> 02:49.504
All of you
get the fuck down!

02:53.841 --> 02:55.510
Yes, call 911.

02:58.278 --> 02:59.681
I'm the lead pharmacist.

02:59.714 --> 03:01.181
Just don't hurt anybody.

03:28.509 --> 03:30.712
Okay, man. Okay, man.

03:37.384 --> 03:38.820
This guy was trying
to fucking run.

03:43.825 --> 03:46.426
All right, uh,
just take your clothes off.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.030
What?

03:49.063 --> 03:50.330
Just fucking
take your clothes off.

03:51.398 --> 03:52.967
Why?

03:53.000 --> 03:54.969
Dude, take off
your fucking clothes.

04:00.440 --> 04:01.509
What's your name?

04:02.543 --> 04:03.611
Luke.

04:04.846 --> 04:08.950
I would have run, too, but
probably wouldn't have made it.

04:08.983 --> 04:11.819
Now you can wait for
LAPD to save you.

04:11.853 --> 04:15.056

04:31.338 --> 04:33.373
Hey, this is from
little kids' book.

04:34.509 --> 04:35.910
It's from
when I left home.

04:37.078 --> 04:38.613
Used to be my lucky shirt.

04:39.547 --> 04:40.915
When did it stop being lucky?

04:41.816 --> 04:43.283
When you stole it.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.362
Yo, what the fuck are you doing?

04:55.395 --> 04:56.998
Can't you hear the sirens?
We gotta go.

05:04.672 --> 05:05.673
Are you sick?

05:07.440 --> 05:08.441
Yeah.

05:16.483 --> 05:17.819
All of you get the fuck out!

05:42.977 --> 05:44.979
Bobby. Bobby, Bobby, quick.

05:52.186 --> 05:53.855
Why are you wearing
those kids' clothes?

08:07.321 --> 08:09.090
Hey, easy, all right? Come on.

08:09.123 --> 08:10.191
I like them so much.

08:13.227 --> 08:15.596
I put two for you
in the back of the car.

08:15.629 --> 08:17.765
All right, well, just
save some for us, okay?

08:17.798 --> 08:20.034
No, I mean,
why would I even do this?

08:20.067 --> 08:22.036
Hey, don't give them
all of them, all right?

08:40.154 --> 08:41.155
You good?

08:52.867 --> 08:54.769
Look, the only person I could
have got it from was you.

08:54.802 --> 08:56.937
So I'm gonna go on
'cause I love you, but...

08:56.971 --> 08:58.739
Cole.

08:58.773 --> 09:00.174
They need to see you
in the office.

09:08.015 --> 09:09.850
Blake, are you all right?

09:12.253 --> 09:15.056
Come on. Let's go in my office.
Come on.

09:26.901 --> 09:27.968
<i>Mija.</i>

09:30.638 --> 09:32.706
Oh, and you can take that
mask off in here.

09:34.675 --> 09:37.044
Thank you for this.

09:37.078 --> 09:40.281
You don't know how many people
this is going to help.

09:40.314 --> 09:43.684
What you two did,
it took a lot of courage,

09:43.717 --> 09:46.720
but you've got to...
Honey, honey, honey...

09:48.189 --> 09:50.291
It's going to be okay.

09:50.324 --> 09:52.893
First things first,
we get the results...

09:55.429 --> 09:58.099
Have you had sex with anyone
else since you've been tested?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.769
Use any needles
since you've been tested?

10:02.670 --> 10:03.671
No.

10:05.306 --> 10:06.373
Good.

10:10.344 --> 10:12.246
I just, um...
I thought the point of this

10:12.279 --> 10:15.816
was to help other people, you
know, like, if I could just not...

10:15.850 --> 10:20.287
Hey, you can't help anyone
unless you help yourself.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.225
- <i>Bien?</i>
- Mmm-hmm.

10:25.459 --> 10:26.660
<i>Bien.</i>

10:26.694 --> 10:32.199
Okay, so let's get these meds
to the doctor in Free City.

10:32.233 --> 10:35.736
This is the address where you're gonna
drop off the medication, all right?

10:35.769 --> 10:37.805
Joe will make
the introduction.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.340
Cole's worried if, um...

10:39.373 --> 10:45.379
If we give it all away, then there
won't be anything left for him or us.

10:45.412 --> 10:48.048
Cole's what got you
in this room.

10:48.082 --> 10:51.152
Now, Joe's the man
who knows the doctor.

10:51.185 --> 10:52.953
He used to live in Free City,

10:52.987 --> 10:54.822
where they don't
have medication.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.090
Is he sick, too?

10:56.123 --> 10:57.791
It's not your concern.

10:57.825 --> 10:59.093
You meet Joe...

11:00.127 --> 11:01.428
you deliver the meds...

11:02.229 --> 11:05.332
and you haul your ass
to Mexico.

11:06.734 --> 11:08.035
And don't worry about Cole.

11:09.370 --> 11:11.238
I'll bring him out to you.

11:11.272 --> 11:12.840
Send the next person in.

11:16.443 --> 11:18.112
Here, take a condom.
It's free.

11:18.145 --> 11:21.448
I'll take the mask...

I need another cake.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.783
<i>We don't have any white,
we only have dark, and we don't deliver.</i>

<i>How much chocolate?</i>

11:59.019 --> 12:02.456
Uh, 1/8 chocolate
is about what I got.

12:02.489 --> 12:04.291
<i>We're only doing
pick-ups for you now.</i>

12:04.325 --> 12:06.260
Okay. Yeah, well,
I'll be there in 10.

12:06.293 --> 12:07.294
Okay.

12:22.409 --> 12:26.046
Hey, I'm sorry
that took so long.

12:26.080 --> 12:29.083
I have the next one.
It's supposed to be on Rosewood.

12:29.116 --> 12:31.118
And then we're supposed
to meet this Joe guy,

12:31.151 --> 12:33.220
and he'll take us
down to the last drop.

12:37.391 --> 12:40.828
I'm gonna open it
when we get there, the end.

12:44.064 --> 12:47.101

What the fuck?

13:23.070 --> 13:25.507
- Hey, I just...
- Are you the robber from the fucking pharmacy?

13:25.540 --> 13:28.510
- Dude, I just brought your meds and your T-shirt.
- Get the fuck away from me.

13:34.448 --> 13:36.950
Hey, Bobby! What the fuck
are you doing?

Fuck!

14:26.668 --> 14:28.402

14:28.435 --> 14:30.437
That's how I know
where you live.

14:30.471 --> 14:33.608
- I don't give a shit!
- Okay, we have to get you out of there.

14:33.641 --> 14:36.009
- We're gonna open the trunk again...
- Open!

15:06.440 --> 15:08.041

- I don't need meds.

- Just calm down.

15:39.072 --> 15:41.609
- Please. Please just take the fucking cash...
- I have these for you.

15:43.745 --> 15:44.813

16:07.502 --> 16:09.671
Can you tell this little girl
to give me my shit back?

16:09.704 --> 16:12.105
I can't believe you fucking
trade those when we...

16:12.139 --> 16:17.144
Okay, look. All this shit, okay,
it's a money-making operation.

16:17.177 --> 16:19.246
They don't fucking work.
They're selling you sugar pills.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.448
- You don't fucking know that...
- Yes, they're a corporate company.

16:21.482 --> 16:23.217

off of you.

You know how I fucking know?
I'm a junkie.

16:33.661 --> 16:35.797

I won't call the cops

way that you did at that place.

16:39.634 --> 16:42.236
Just let me go,
because if you don't give me that shit,

16:42.269 --> 16:45.339
leave me with that, I'm gonna be sick.
I'm gonna be throwing up.

16:45.372 --> 16:47.575
Okay, fine.
Bobby, start the car.

- What is she doing?

16:54.616 --> 16:55.750
Fuck!

17:01.355 --> 17:02.557
Fuck.

17:15.102 --> 17:21.074
You don't know what I did to get
that shit... The fucking cake.

17:21.108 --> 17:23.310
I wish you saw what we
went through to get that.

17:23.343 --> 17:27.682
- Look, I'm sorry, but I...
- You don't know what I did, so either fucking kill me...

17:28.616 --> 17:29.784
or help me.

17:31.553 --> 17:33.655
Okay, look.
We can help you, but...

17:34.756 --> 17:36.423
Just...

but if you come with us

we're going to, okay...

17:42.329 --> 17:44.197
you can help us,
and I will find a way.

17:44.231 --> 17:46.768
I'll figure it out.
I will help you, okay? I promise.

17:49.904 --> 17:52.774
I'm really sorry
she did that. But...

17:53.675 --> 17:55.543
We'll figure it out. Just...

17:57.712 --> 17:59.279
I know it's weird
to ask you to trust me

17:59.313 --> 18:02.249
'cause you don't
fucking know me, but I will...

18:02.282 --> 18:04.318
I will find a way
to help you, okay?

- Yeah, cough syrup.

19:20.494 --> 19:22.362
- We don't have water. Sorry.
- Okay.

19:38.613 --> 19:40.948
But I don't want water.
I was just asking.

19:42.416 --> 19:45.485
- Just that, please. And this...
- Yes, thank you.

Mexican, um, peanut butter... thing.

20:52.086 --> 20:54.321

the banana chocolate shake.

20:54.354 --> 20:56.389
Oh, of course.
I'll make that for her.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.760
- Very good. Okay
- Okay.

21:20.915 --> 21:23.684
<i>Police are searching for
Luke Hart, a 22-year-old man,</i>

21:23.718 --> 21:27.054
<i>one of the victims in the pharmacy
robbery that took place earlier today.</i>

21:27.088 --> 21:30.323
<i>Police were already en route to
Mr. Hart's house for questioning...</i>

21:32.593 --> 21:34.796
Why are they saying
drug-related?

21:34.829 --> 21:39.700
<i>Mr. Hart was thrown in the trunk of
a gray Buick, leaving behind a cake.</i>

21:39.734 --> 21:41.636
She's talking
about the cake.

21:41.669 --> 21:43.538
The one that you knocked out
of my hands.

21:43.938 --> 21:45.338
The heroin?

21:48.709 --> 21:51.846
<i>...feature the architects
Bob Jones and Alister MacKenzie</i>

22:03.891 --> 22:05.358
<i>leaving behind a cake...</i>

22:14.434 --> 22:17.370
<i>...and that she can still
hear him screaming for help.</i>

22:17.404 --> 22:19.674
We're in heaven.
We're in heaven.

22:26.581 --> 22:27.849
I'm gonna throw up.

22:29.116 --> 22:30.885
Blake?

22:30.918 --> 22:32.887
Yeah, I'm... I'm Blake.

22:32.920 --> 22:36.791
Nice to meet you.
Uh, who's your crew?

22:36.824 --> 22:38.726
That's, uh, Bobby in the front.

22:38.759 --> 22:40.828
And that's Luke.
He's kind of sick right now.

22:40.862 --> 22:45.398
Yeah. Seems the city's
spitting people out in pieces.

22:46.100 --> 22:47.635
Well, uh, come on in.

22:47.668 --> 22:49.937
Uh, everybody
except Luke there.

22:49.971 --> 22:53.040
He can put on a mask
before he comes into my place.

22:53.074 --> 22:54.575
Come on, come on. Come on in.

22:58.079 --> 22:59.780
Hey, you want a drink?

22:59.814 --> 23:01.549
No, I'm good. Thank you.

23:01.582 --> 23:02.550
Smell that?

23:02.583 --> 23:05.086
Smell that? That's a beautiful
smell, ain't it?

23:05.753 --> 23:06.754
Oh.

23:14.795 --> 23:16.631
Do you need help
with something?

23:28.843 --> 23:30.477
How long have you lived here?

23:31.646 --> 23:32.713
Uh...

23:34.682 --> 23:36.751
long time.

23:36.784 --> 23:40.154
I like, um, your furniture. It's really comfortable.

23:40.187 --> 23:42.089
It's my Mamaw's.

23:42.123 --> 23:43.991
- Oh, yeah?
- We called her Mamaw. Yeah, Mamaw's.

23:44.025 --> 23:45.458
She was a tough lady.

23:45.492 --> 23:46.560
Yep.

23:49.130 --> 23:50.831
Yeah.

23:52.566 --> 23:53.634
What's wrong?

23:54.101 --> 23:55.970
Um, with what?

23:56.003 --> 23:57.171
What's wrong with...
your friend?

23:57.204 --> 24:00.708
No, no.
Your friend Luke, outside.

24:00.741 --> 24:03.476
Oh, he's fine. He just needs to...
He'll be okay.

24:03.511 --> 24:05.046
Well, good. Good.

24:05.079 --> 24:06.847
What's wrong with him, though?

24:06.881 --> 24:08.950
He just needs some fresh air.

24:08.983 --> 24:10.017
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

24:10.051 --> 24:11.552
Yeah.

24:11.585 --> 24:14.855
Fresh air. Contagious?

24:14.889 --> 24:17.091
I mean, he might have
some kind of flu or something.

24:17.124 --> 24:19.961
Wait, wait, wait.
You gotta put this on him.

24:20.995 --> 24:24.799
I mean, I'm, uh...

24:24.832 --> 24:29.203
Trying to get dinner ready, so, you know, I
want to stay healthy for us all. You know.

24:32.673 --> 24:35.876
Health first, right?

24:36.444 --> 24:37.645
Okay.

24:41.048 --> 24:42.116
You want a drink?

24:42.149 --> 24:43.651
May I make a suggestion?

24:45.553 --> 24:48.723
This new grape drink
I'm really taking to.

24:48.756 --> 24:49.824
You want grape?

24:51.559 --> 24:52.626
Yeah.

24:53.227 --> 24:54.695
Oh, God.

24:57.064 --> 24:58.866
She don't talk much, does she?

24:58.899 --> 25:00.500
She lost her voice.

25:32.867 --> 25:34.135
I fucking love this creature.

25:35.336 --> 25:37.605
You know, I don't have
a lady to share it with, but...

25:37.638 --> 25:39.607
Fuck it.
You don't go bad fashion

25:39.640 --> 25:41.809
so that I can get a fucking girl
over here, anyway.

25:41.842 --> 25:45.613
So I'm just fucking happy to
share it with you guys, right?

25:45.646 --> 25:47.948
Well, Rosa said
you were gonna take us

25:47.982 --> 25:51.085
- down to the Free City, introduce us to the doctor.
- Oh.

25:51.118 --> 25:54.855
It's waiting game out here, you know.
You have to wait a while.

25:54.889 --> 25:58.592
I don't know what you mean. She said,
um, that they knew we were coming,

25:58.626 --> 26:00.928
and they needed it,
what we're bringing.

26:00.961 --> 26:03.030
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

26:03.064 --> 26:05.332
Hey, hey, man. Hey, I don't want
you around this... This food, man.

26:05.366 --> 26:07.001
Not around this crab.

26:07.034 --> 26:10.071
You know, you got to keep him
in the living room.

26:10.104 --> 26:13.874
No. Sit down. LUKE: Come on, now.
Where's the bathroom?

26:13.908 --> 26:17.678
Bathroom is right around
the corner on the right.

26:17.711 --> 26:20.347
- Put on your mask.
- Fuck you.

26:26.720 --> 26:28.689
You know, I've seen
that kind of sick before.

26:30.958 --> 26:32.793
You get sick,
waiting like that.

26:39.733 --> 26:42.136
Kinda messy, right?

26:42.169 --> 26:46.807
But, you know,
all good things are messy.

26:46.841 --> 26:49.210
You haven't come out
to this town before, have you?

26:49.243 --> 26:52.813
There's a reason why Rosa
wanted you to meet with me

26:52.847 --> 26:56.417
so I can drive it in safely.

26:56.450 --> 27:01.122
You know?
'Cause, uh, I got guns.

27:01.155 --> 27:02.723
And guns are
what you need out here.

27:10.831 --> 27:12.967
<i>...sedate Mr. Hart,</i>

27:13.000 --> 27:15.402
<i>then throw him in the trunk
of a gray Buick.</i>

27:20.374 --> 27:24.345
<i>The Hart family has offered
a reward of $10,000.</i>

27:24.378 --> 27:25.846
So, um...

27:27.948 --> 27:29.950
how much medication
have you got for us, huh?

27:29.984 --> 27:31.285
Let's see it.

27:31.318 --> 27:33.020
We have enough
from the doctor.

27:41.896 --> 27:43.430
I mean, why don't you guys
just stay here for the night?

27:43.464 --> 27:44.465
We'll go meet the doctor
in the morning.

27:44.498 --> 27:46.800
Rosa said you were gonna
call him in or something.

27:48.068 --> 27:49.970
Call him?

27:50.004 --> 27:52.873
How am I gonna call him?
Huh?

27:52.907 --> 27:55.009
I mean, they don't have phones
out there.

27:55.042 --> 27:57.111
I know. I tried to bring
a fucking phone out there,

27:57.144 --> 27:59.046
but I was the only one
at the phone.

27:59.980 --> 28:01.182
He ain't at the phone.

28:01.215 --> 28:03.417
- There's no fucking phone out there, man.
- I'm sorry.

28:03.450 --> 28:05.052
We actually have to go. Um...

28:05.085 --> 28:06.954
No, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

28:06.987 --> 28:10.224
Look. You know,
there's another thing I like about crab.

28:10.257 --> 28:12.226
When they catch
these sons of bitches,

28:12.259 --> 28:15.863
they throw them all in one
bucket, keep them alive and fresh.

28:15.896 --> 28:17.398
And those crabs must know
they're gonna get eaten,

28:17.431 --> 28:20.201
because when one of them tries
to get out, the other ones...

28:20.234 --> 28:23.437
They pinch at it. They pinch at it.
They pinch at it.

28:23.470 --> 28:25.472
They pull it back in.

28:25.507 --> 28:29.376
Right? They think, "If we ain't
getting out, you ain't getting out.

28:29.410 --> 28:31.145
"If you ain't getting out...

28:31.178 --> 28:37.952
"We swimming
in one big bucket."

28:42.223 --> 28:43.791
Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

28:43.824 --> 28:45.459
- Are you okay?
- I need medication.

28:45.492 --> 28:47.861
That's it. We all do. See?

28:47.895 --> 28:49.797
We're all need the medication
right now.

28:49.830 --> 28:51.232
Go count it, boy.

28:57.838 --> 28:59.073
What the fuck's going on?

28:59.106 --> 29:00.508
My name is...

29:00.542 --> 29:02.309
I think he's gonna
call the cops.

29:02.343 --> 29:04.178
What?

29:04.211 --> 29:05.346
There was a radio in there.

29:05.379 --> 29:08.015
He knows that
you guys took me.

29:08.048 --> 29:09.183
- Let's, um...
- Fucking go.

29:09.216 --> 29:10.784
Yeah. Okay, okay. Yeah.

29:17.224 --> 29:19.561
Crabby son of a bitch.

29:19.594 --> 29:23.364
The hell you think you're doing,
huh, leaving with that sick kid?

29:23.397 --> 29:25.833
Leave him right here
with the medication pills.

29:25.866 --> 29:28.035
Leave him here
with that medication.

29:45.486 --> 29:49.023
<i>But, Jack,
you let her leave.</i>

29:49.056 --> 29:51.458
<i>You let the fucking meds go.</i>

29:51.492 --> 29:54.962
<i>This is what happens when you
chase the problem and not the cure.</i>

29:54.995 --> 29:56.196
<i>Look what you've done now.</i>

29:56.230 --> 29:59.500
<i>I don't need mutes
and drug addicts stealing meds.</i>

29:59.534 --> 30:02.236
How about I take down
this little illegal robbery

30:02.269 --> 30:04.471
<i>pharmaceutical operation
you got going on here</i>

30:04.506 --> 30:07.174
<i>and I get me some</i>
<i>fucking reward money?</i>

30:16.050 --> 30:18.452
<i>But, Blake,
you can't go there by yourself.</i>

30:18.485 --> 30:20.087
<i>It's dangerous.</i>

30:20.120 --> 30:24.391
<i>He used to practice medicine in the
Free City. He helped so many people.</i>

30:24.425 --> 30:27.494
<i>I'll call Joe for you
and find out.</i>

30:27.529 --> 30:31.198
Yeah, but he fucking tried
to rob us or set us up.

30:31.231 --> 30:32.900
<i>Just tell me where you are.</i>

30:32.933 --> 30:35.969
Don't tell her where we are.

30:36.003 --> 30:39.206
- <i>I'll send Cole to get you, okay? He's almost done.</i>
- No. Just, um...

30:39.239 --> 30:41.576
No, just tell him
I'm coming back, okay?

30:41.609 --> 30:42.876
<i>Blake.</i>

30:43.944 --> 30:45.012
Who?

30:49.617 --> 30:52.453
The guy who was
at the pharmacy with me.

30:52.486 --> 30:55.322
So, the guy you robbed
the pharmacy with,

30:55.356 --> 30:58.492
who fucking threw me
in the back room

30:58.526 --> 31:01.428
that you then robbed
to give the drugs to the doctor.

31:01.462 --> 31:02.496
That's not what was
supposed to happen.

31:02.530 --> 31:03.698
We were supposed
to give them away.

31:03.732 --> 31:06.534
But he then wanted to fucking
keep them all for himself.

31:07.635 --> 31:09.136
To sell them?

31:09.704 --> 31:11.405
No. Um...

31:12.574 --> 31:14.274
He...
He's pretty sick, actually.

31:14.843 --> 31:16.944
Thinks it's my fault.

31:16.977 --> 31:18.112
Is it your fault?

31:19.213 --> 31:20.214
No.

31:21.215 --> 31:22.550
So where is he now?

31:23.384 --> 31:26.053
He's at the clinic,
waiting for me.

31:28.188 --> 31:29.624
Don't trust too many people.

31:37.565 --> 31:38.966
Excuse me, ma'am.

31:40.401 --> 31:43.103
Um, we're trying
to find a doctor.

31:44.405 --> 31:45.472
We have an appointment.

31:46.440 --> 31:47.642
This ain't a hospital.

31:52.980 --> 31:55.949
You need to talk to Emerald
about Jack.

31:55.983 --> 31:57.985
She's been waiting for you.

31:58.586 --> 32:00.154
Okay, where is she?

32:01.388 --> 32:03.658
She's in the Free City.

32:03.691 --> 32:07.428
You're in the $35
a night city, you know.

32:07.461 --> 32:10.431
If he's gonna be bumping into
stuff, he can't be in here.

32:10.464 --> 32:13.267
He just can't be in here if
he's gonna be stumbling around.

32:13.300 --> 32:14.968
I saw him
right when he came in.

32:16.571 --> 32:18.138
What month is it?

32:18.172 --> 32:21.576
It's... June.

32:21.609 --> 32:24.512
Uh, wait, July. It's July.

32:25.547 --> 32:26.413
Could you call her?

32:31.151 --> 32:32.554
Any other local?

32:32.587 --> 32:36.658
This is local.
You just have to listen to it.

32:36.691 --> 32:40.461
Really, really listen.

32:40.494 --> 32:43.230
<i>With a two shot
lead, Grady hits a driver</i>

32:43.263 --> 32:44.766
<i>way to the right on 15.</i>

32:49.671 --> 32:51.071
I'm gonna
fucking die.

32:56.711 --> 32:58.680
How many bags you guys got?

32:58.713 --> 33:01.148
I can take them for you
if you want.

33:02.550 --> 33:03.718
That's a wet map.

33:05.653 --> 33:06.987
It's okay.

33:07.822 --> 33:09.557
I only need...

33:12.159 --> 33:13.661
All right.

33:13.695 --> 33:17.297
Luke, why don't you take
this out to Bobby?

33:17.331 --> 33:20.635
Snitches get stitches,
the thieves feed the trees.

33:20.668 --> 33:23.571
At least that's what happened
to my friend last week.

33:23.605 --> 33:26.708
Yeah, well, you know,
we stole this from her friend.

33:27.341 --> 33:30.244
He was a desert fisherman.

33:30.277 --> 33:31.478
I think she needs
some new friends.

33:31.513 --> 33:32.714
Why don't you go, um...

33:32.747 --> 33:34.314
Yeah, maybe some people who...

33:34.348 --> 33:37.017
Okay, do you wanna go outside?

33:37.886 --> 33:40.555
Um, our hotel
is full right now,

33:40.588 --> 33:44.191
so you need to go
and stay with Emerald,

33:44.224 --> 33:45.660
stay in the camp.

33:45.693 --> 33:47.529
You've got a nice wet map.

33:47.562 --> 33:49.329
You know what to do.

33:49.363 --> 33:51.533
Start at East Jesus.

33:51.566 --> 33:52.600
East Jesus.

33:52.634 --> 33:55.068
Well, you keep
coming on back, now.

33:55.102 --> 33:58.640
And bring a friend,
if you have any lady.

33:58.673 --> 34:02.075
If not, I'll be your friend.

34:03.210 --> 34:04.846
Okay, thank you.

34:52.894 --> 34:55.462
Where the fuck is he gonna sleep?

34:55.495 --> 34:57.297
Hey, can you wake up?
We need your help.

35:15.449 --> 35:16.751
Hey! Hey, excuse me!

35:18.352 --> 35:19.854
Yo! Yo, come to my camp!

35:20.855 --> 35:21.889
Over here.

35:41.408 --> 35:42.409
Luke.

35:48.315 --> 35:49.483
Let's go. We're stuck.

36:00.360 --> 36:01.929
There's a guy
who's gonna help us.

36:20.347 --> 36:21.649
Welcome to the camp.

36:23.951 --> 36:25.318
Would dig your car out.

36:25.352 --> 36:27.254
Let's smoke first and relax.

36:30.725 --> 36:32.694
- Hey, guys.
- Mmm.

36:32.727 --> 36:33.761
Welcome.

36:34.562 --> 36:36.931
Um, so...

36:36.964 --> 36:39.834
if, uh, people get stuck here
all the time,

36:39.867 --> 36:41.669
why don't you put up
a sign or something?

36:41.703 --> 36:43.504
'Cause that sucks.

36:43.538 --> 36:46.708
Well, then we wouldn't meet
nice people like yourself.

36:46.741 --> 36:48.876
It takes about...
About an hour

36:48.910 --> 36:50.812
for city folks
of detox out here.

36:53.648 --> 36:55.983
- Do you use detoxing?
- So what's your name?

36:56.017 --> 36:58.853
- Who the fuck are you?
- Emerald.

36:58.886 --> 37:01.756
Oh, my God.
Um, the girl at the hotel,

37:01.789 --> 37:05.760
um, told us to talk to you about
this meeting we have with the doctor.

37:06.961 --> 37:08.361
- The doctor?
- She did?

37:08.395 --> 37:09.997
Yeah. Do you know him?

37:10.798 --> 37:12.399
Yeah, I know the doctor.

37:14.434 --> 37:15.837
Do you guys know this Joe guy?

37:15.870 --> 37:17.872
That was who was supposed
to take us here.

37:17.905 --> 37:19.874
- Joe?
- I know a Jack.

37:19.907 --> 37:21.743
I only know a guy named Jack.

37:21.776 --> 37:23.477
I don't know a Joe.

37:23.511 --> 37:25.913
He lived in a phone booth
out here for 10 years

37:25.947 --> 37:28.448
and talked to everyone
that called it,

37:28.482 --> 37:30.985
- mostly wrong numbers, but...
- It doesn't work anymore.

37:31.018 --> 37:32.252
That's the only people
he talked to.

37:32.285 --> 37:34.622
- Someone burned it.
- And, uh, these were his dreadlocks.

37:34.655 --> 37:36.758
I'm trying to grow mine out
in honor of him.

37:39.894 --> 37:41.394
Where's the mute girl going?

37:44.331 --> 37:47.602
We have to swim in order to survive.

37:49.336 --> 37:50.938
In order to survive.

37:52.372 --> 37:53.741
We need to swim.

37:57.444 --> 37:58.813
You don't know how to swim?

37:58.846 --> 38:03.483
Well, I'm sorry, but...
you're lost.

38:11.526 --> 38:12.827
Did you bring anything?

38:13.828 --> 38:15.530
What, like food and water?

38:15.563 --> 38:16.931
We brought fucking meds.

38:19.634 --> 38:21.869
Okay? And she went
through hell to get it here.

38:21.903 --> 38:23.370
- And I need methadone.
- Out here?

38:23.403 --> 38:25.072
Do you guys have that here?

38:25.106 --> 38:26.473
We have the real thing.

38:28.576 --> 38:29.710
That's what he needs.

38:30.878 --> 38:32.814
Have the real thing.

38:32.847 --> 38:34.916
Look, we have the meds,

38:34.949 --> 38:37.819
but we're only gonna
trade it for methadone, okay?

38:37.852 --> 38:43.024
Uh, or, I got cash,
so how much do...

38:43.057 --> 38:44.959
<i>Cash doesn't do
anything out here.</i>

38:55.036 --> 38:56.804
Okay, if you guys
don't know this doctor,

38:56.838 --> 38:59.540
do you at least know someone
that can take us?

38:59.574 --> 39:01.042
To someone that knows, like...

39:01.075 --> 39:03.077
Yo, I'm the doctor,
God damn it.

39:03.110 --> 39:05.546
We're gonna get down
to trade in what I want.

39:05.580 --> 39:07.648
Are you ready?
Trade for what I want?

39:07.682 --> 39:09.449
Do you not want cash?

39:24.532 --> 39:26.534
We're all
waiting out here.

39:26.567 --> 39:28.102
We're all waiting.

39:51.458 --> 39:53.895
- Hi... I am so sorry.
- Hi.

39:53.928 --> 39:55.096
It's just that place,
you know?

39:55.129 --> 39:58.465
It's like it's so weird
in there, right?

39:58.498 --> 40:02.069
And I guess, you know,
just strangers in this place,

40:02.103 --> 40:04.437
just sometimes
you never know, right?

40:04.471 --> 40:06.107
You just have to be careful
and make sure that...

40:06.140 --> 40:08.776
- Thanks.
- I'm good.

40:08.809 --> 40:12.046
You sure you should be
doing that right now?

40:12.079 --> 40:13.413
I don't care.

40:17.718 --> 40:21.522
I'm sorry about what I said
about the meds.

40:21.555 --> 40:24.592
They... They may work.

40:24.625 --> 40:25.993
I don't know. I'm fucked up.

40:31.599 --> 40:33.567
Are you sure you don't wanna
know the results?

40:34.936 --> 40:35.970
Yeah.

40:37.905 --> 40:39.774
We both risked our lives.

40:39.807 --> 40:42.076
Just different drugs,
but same high.

40:42.109 --> 40:44.011
No, I risked my life
to help others.

40:44.045 --> 40:45.947
There's a big difference.

40:45.980 --> 40:47.882
Happy when you get
your fix like me.

40:49.116 --> 40:51.953
No, I mean,
you willingly take yours.

40:53.120 --> 40:55.723
Mine was given to me.
It's different.

40:58.025 --> 41:00.528
Well, I think, um...

41:00.561 --> 41:04.598
that both
people were risking their lives,

41:04.632 --> 41:05.967
do it to numb out...

41:07.535 --> 41:09.203
You know.

41:09.236 --> 41:11.639
It's like we all get
pricked by something.

41:11.672 --> 41:13.140
Sometimes it's dangerous.

41:14.542 --> 41:16.110
That's all going to kill us
in the end.

41:16.143 --> 41:18.079
I would just rather take
a hot shot of heroin

41:18.112 --> 41:19.146
and have sex with someone

41:19.180 --> 41:21.816
who may have a disease,
and make me die slower.

41:21.849 --> 41:23.918
Sounds like a waste of life.

41:23.951 --> 41:25.853
It's kinda selfish.

41:25.886 --> 41:28.990
Kinda selfish to think
that you can fix everyone.

41:29.023 --> 41:30.791
It's narcissistic, actually.

41:32.560 --> 41:33.961
I don't think
I can fix everyone.

41:33.995 --> 41:36.564
I just like... I can't sit
in a room with people

41:36.597 --> 41:38.165
that are in pain
and not do anything.

41:38.199 --> 41:39.834
I mean, I have to help.

41:40.968 --> 41:43.004
- What?
- It's still kind of selfish.

41:43.037 --> 41:44.572
- How?
- It's still kind of selfish,

41:44.605 --> 41:47.575
because you're uncomfortable
sitting in a room

41:47.608 --> 41:51.212
when there's someone in pain,
but it's your uncomfort, you know.

41:51.245 --> 41:52.813
It's like...
It's about your uncomfort.

41:52.847 --> 41:56.017
What are you... So you can't even be
comfortable just sitting here by a fire.

41:56.050 --> 41:57.818
I mean, nothing's wrong,
you know?

41:57.852 --> 41:59.286
You're like...

41:59.320 --> 42:02.490
You're hot, you're cold.
You want that, well...

42:03.290 --> 42:04.959
Wow. No.

42:06.594 --> 42:08.829
You gotta eat.

42:08.863 --> 42:12.533
Do you know where
you're staying tonight?

42:18.806 --> 42:22.710
Would you like to stay
in my dead bus?

42:22.743 --> 42:24.278
What is that?

42:24.311 --> 42:25.946
All right. Okay, it's a...

42:25.980 --> 42:28.315
It's a mattress.
It's roofed, there's light.

42:28.349 --> 42:31.052
And then Bobby can stay
with me if she wants.

42:33.220 --> 42:34.755
It sounds really good.

42:34.789 --> 42:36.590
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

42:36.624 --> 42:38.325
He probably needs to lie down.

42:42.730 --> 42:44.932
Good.

42:44.965 --> 42:48.069
Everyone, you just grab a torch
because it is very, very dark.

42:50.871 --> 42:53.040
Um, also, quick warning.

42:53.074 --> 42:55.876
My little friend Cody
is gonna...

42:55.910 --> 43:00.748
be so excited if he sees you,
because he always celebrates his birthday

43:00.781 --> 43:03.284
every single day of the year.

43:03.317 --> 43:05.119
But he never shows up.

43:11.392 --> 43:13.794
Hey, you left my fliers
to my birthday.

43:13.828 --> 43:15.296
Oh, Cody.

43:15.329 --> 43:16.397
Cool.

43:16.430 --> 43:18.032
- When's this?
- Tonight.

43:18.065 --> 43:20.668
- Tonight? All right.
- We're coming.

43:20.701 --> 43:23.804
I promise you. I'll just need
to give them some new clothes.

43:23.838 --> 43:25.106
You wanna go?

43:25.139 --> 43:27.408
I'm not gonna go.
I don't feel good.

43:27.441 --> 43:30.277
Hey, Emerald, is there a place
he could lay down?

43:30.311 --> 43:32.213
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

43:33.013 --> 43:34.281
Luke.

43:34.315 --> 43:37.418
Are you sure you don't
wanna come to my party?

43:37.451 --> 43:39.687
- I'm sure, man.
- You suck.

43:39.720 --> 43:41.155
This little shit.

43:41.188 --> 43:44.125
Okay, just put
your torches down.

43:45.893 --> 43:47.394
All right.

43:48.162 --> 43:49.697
Welcome.

43:49.730 --> 43:53.267
Uh, almost everything you need
will be in this bus.

43:53.300 --> 43:55.736
I will get some more
stuff for him.

43:55.769 --> 44:00.941
And then we can
get ready for...

44:00.975 --> 44:03.077
- My party!
- ...Cody's birthday party.

44:04.178 --> 44:05.779
Okay, I'll see you in a bit.

44:13.454 --> 44:17.191
Bobby, Emerald wants to
show you where you're sleeping.

44:21.295 --> 44:23.230
- Hey, are you okay?
- Mmm.

44:24.231 --> 44:26.033
All right.

44:26.066 --> 44:27.801
I hope he feels better.

44:52.459 --> 44:54.395
It doesn't look
so scary to me.

44:54.428 --> 44:55.530
He's got a sword on it.

44:55.564 --> 44:58.165
It's the ace of spades.

44:58.199 --> 44:59.867
- Oh, wow. Holy shit.
- Wow.

44:59.900 --> 45:01.802
That sounds good.

45:01.835 --> 45:04.071
And it means focus and clarity.

45:04.104 --> 45:06.407
So clear your mind, man,
and focus.

45:07.542 --> 45:09.143
I guess we're both fucked.

45:14.415 --> 45:15.716
You feel better now?

45:15.983 --> 45:16.984
Yeah.

45:19.486 --> 45:22.089
I don't know
it exists in me, but...

45:22.122 --> 45:24.758
I think it's like gasoline.

45:24.792 --> 45:27.461
It's highly...

45:27.494 --> 45:30.831
Highly volatile,
but it mellows out when I shoot up.

45:32.066 --> 45:34.235
It sounds very scary.

45:34.268 --> 45:36.870
It's not scary to people
who have it in their veins.

45:38.272 --> 45:40.441
It's only scary to those
who don't.

45:41.543 --> 45:43.844
Everything exists in you.

45:54.188 --> 45:56.190
You know,
there's a kid I know that...

45:56.223 --> 45:59.893
He OD'd and died of, like, uh...
Over the summer.

45:59.927 --> 46:01.563
Um, this kid, Russell,

46:01.596 --> 46:05.332
and I feel like if he could have found a
place like this, he would have been okay.

46:05.366 --> 46:07.101
But he was, like,
really trapped.

46:09.403 --> 46:12.072
It's just really opened
my eyes to the reality,

46:12.106 --> 46:14.375
and like, how fucked up
reality can be.

46:15.943 --> 46:18.513
- Did you meet Bobby?
- No.

46:18.546 --> 46:20.014
- What's up, buddy?
- Hi.

46:23.017 --> 46:24.118
You okay?

46:25.886 --> 46:27.321
Yeah, I'm... I'm okay.

46:30.224 --> 46:31.959
You don't look like it.

46:33.961 --> 46:35.029
What's up?

46:40.968 --> 46:42.604
This car rolls up
and it was just like,

46:42.637 --> 46:45.439
out the window, like,
all four windows rolled down.

46:45.472 --> 46:48.409
And like, AKs, like shotguns
come out the window

46:48.442 --> 46:51.979
and they just light this kid up,
like, 24 years old, man.

46:52.012 --> 46:53.480
Like, I almost got hit
by the car,

46:53.515 --> 46:55.449
the car that was there
in the drive by.

46:55.482 --> 46:57.552
And I looked in...
I looked at them for a bit of a glance,

46:57.585 --> 47:00.487
and I looked at their faces,
and none of them...

47:00.522 --> 47:02.222
It was like they were just
riding down the road.

47:02.256 --> 47:03.525
They shot this kid to death.

47:03.558 --> 47:06.594
Rolled away, and were just
driving like nothing happened.

47:07.461 --> 47:08.462
Hey.

47:10.030 --> 47:13.901
- Hey.
- You're the girl from the hotel.

47:13.934 --> 47:18.238
Yeah. You're the sick kid,
and his girlfriend.

47:19.607 --> 47:21.442
You find that room or what?

47:21.475 --> 47:24.244
Yeah. Yeah, we did.
She's taken care of us.

47:24.278 --> 47:27.615
That's great, right?

47:27.649 --> 47:33.253
You know, um, if you need a place to
stay, you just let me know, okay?

47:34.622 --> 47:37.024
Okay? Great.

47:37.057 --> 47:38.258
See you later.

47:40.060 --> 47:41.061
Want some?

47:41.962 --> 47:44.264
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

47:46.133 --> 47:47.201
Bye.

47:51.238 --> 47:53.140
I get a weird vibe...

48:00.180 --> 48:02.015
It's all kind of a vibe.

48:31.044 --> 48:32.913
You're so funny.

48:34.014 --> 48:35.349
Are you teething?

48:43.591 --> 48:45.058
Do you need help?

48:45.092 --> 48:46.728
Thanks, guys,
I really appreciate it.

48:46.761 --> 48:48.328
- No problem.
- What's your name?

48:48.362 --> 48:50.063
- My name is Ryan.
- Hi, Ryan. I'm Blake.

48:50.097 --> 48:51.398
What do you normally
sell on this?

48:51.432 --> 48:54.134
Oh, we have chickens and
ducks, and we sell their eggs.

48:54.168 --> 48:55.670
And then they don't use
money here, right?

48:55.703 --> 48:57.539
So you trade?

48:57.572 --> 48:58.706
- We trade for things, yeah.
- That's cool.

48:58.740 --> 49:01.175
Didn't expect to work out today, huh?

49:01.208 --> 49:03.511
I don't expect to work out
any day, really.

49:03.545 --> 49:04.646
Hello, sir.

49:06.514 --> 49:07.682
He's got the hair.

49:07.715 --> 49:09.082
Welcome.

49:09.116 --> 49:11.185
Thank you.

49:11.218 --> 49:13.187
- Wow.
- Welcome right inside.

49:14.388 --> 49:16.156
Thank you
for letting us...

49:16.190 --> 49:17.458
Thanks for helping me.

49:17.491 --> 49:19.493
- Did you build all this?
- Yeah. Bit by bit.

49:19.527 --> 49:20.528
Uh, all the pieces that...

49:21.128 --> 49:23.163
Hat. Okay.

49:24.465 --> 49:25.533
Cowboy.

49:25.999 --> 49:27.367
You met a cowboy?

49:31.573 --> 49:34.308
Needles and shit...
Yeah. He's a junkie?

49:34.341 --> 49:36.376
The cowboy j...
The cowboy junkie!

49:36.410 --> 49:38.479
Okay. Yeah, I...
I know who he... Yeah.

49:38.513 --> 49:41.014
I m... I saw him
at the skate park.

49:41.048 --> 49:43.150
Uh, all this water
waters the gardens.

49:43.183 --> 49:46.754
Uh, we have peppers growing,
and tomatoes, loofah sponge.

49:46.788 --> 49:48.556
- How did you learn how to do this?
- Yeah.

49:48.590 --> 49:49.624
Slowly but surely.

49:49.657 --> 49:50.792
I like him.

49:50.825 --> 49:53.227
Can you bring him over later?

49:53.260 --> 49:55.597
You can bring him over?
So I'll be around.

49:55.964 --> 49:57.397
Go that way.

49:57.431 --> 49:59.399
These are the little ones.
They're all rescues.

49:59.433 --> 50:02.269
- Oh. cool.
- We brought all the chickens in from other places around.

50:02.302 --> 50:04.071
People that couldn't keep
their chickens any longer

50:04.104 --> 50:07.040
or didn't realize how hard it is
to keep chickens in the desert.

50:07.074 --> 50:08.576
- Mmm-hmm.
- Um, so...

50:08.610 --> 50:10.377
- Do you guys have eggs?
- Yeah, we do.

50:10.410 --> 50:12.179
- Oh, wow.
- Oh, you really do.

50:12.780 --> 50:13.781
Emerald.

50:16.651 --> 50:18.418
- Hey!
- There she is.

50:19.419 --> 50:20.588
Where's Blake and Luke?

50:21.421 --> 50:22.757
Well, they're somewhere.

50:22.790 --> 50:25.092
They left her
at the skate park.

50:28.830 --> 50:30.397
Found one,
I see, that's stamped.

50:30.430 --> 50:31.533
Yeah, what's...
How's that... LUKE: Yeah.

50:31.566 --> 50:33.100
They don't
come out that way.

50:33.133 --> 50:35.603
What I often do is I put in a store-bought
egg if they haven't been laying,

50:35.637 --> 50:37.672
'cause it'll entice the other
chickens to lay an egg.

50:37.705 --> 50:42.644
They're gonna come over later.
But Luke is gonna come see me...

50:42.677 --> 50:45.112
- after he sees you, okay?
- All right.

50:45.145 --> 50:47.281
So just... don't let him
forget, okay?

50:47.314 --> 50:48.583
- I won't.
- All right.

50:48.616 --> 50:50.450
You have fun in there.

50:50.484 --> 50:52.452
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

50:52.486 --> 50:53.521
Hey, this is my house.

50:53.555 --> 50:55.289
Buy anything from the cart?

50:56.356 --> 50:57.825
Eggs and art.

50:57.859 --> 50:59.459
Have an egg on the house.

50:59.493 --> 51:00.494
Enjoy your eggs.

51:02.496 --> 51:05.667
I don't think
there's anyone on the bus.

51:05.700 --> 51:07.835
Is there ever anyone on the bus?

51:08.736 --> 51:09.771
Hi.

51:09.804 --> 51:12.239
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

51:12.272 --> 51:14.776
We have some wares for trade,
if you want to trade anything.

51:14.809 --> 51:16.243
And we have fresh eggs also.

51:16.276 --> 51:17.779
I don't have anything on me,

51:17.812 --> 51:20.848
but I'm... I'm desperate
for some eggs.

51:20.882 --> 51:24.284
- Okay. Well, uh...
- Yeah, I like this.

51:24.318 --> 51:25.452
That's really pretty.

51:25.485 --> 51:26.788
Well, that's like four eggs.

51:26.821 --> 51:28.221
- Five.
- Five eggs?

51:28.255 --> 51:29.657
That's, like, five eggs.

51:29.691 --> 51:31.258
We'll trade you for something.

51:32.259 --> 51:33.761
- Okay. For real?
- Yeah.

51:33.795 --> 51:35.797
- Okay.
- Do you want that, if we trade?

51:35.830 --> 51:36.798
Yeah.

51:36.831 --> 51:38.900
- Yeah. It's really pretty.
- So it's six eggs,

51:38.933 --> 51:40.602
- like I said before.
- You did not.

51:40.635 --> 51:43.203
- You said four eggs.
- No, I said six eggs.

51:43.236 --> 51:44.906
- I never lie.
- That's all we have.

51:44.939 --> 51:46.040
How's this?
What if we give you...

51:46.074 --> 51:49.176
What if we give you four eggs
and one egg for free?

51:49.209 --> 51:51.746
Well, man, this is...
This is all I got.

51:53.280 --> 51:54.616
Can you hold all...
All of those?

51:54.649 --> 51:56.818
- I got pockets. I got... Look.
- Okay.

51:56.851 --> 51:59.520
- Okay.
- These are my egg pockets.

51:59.554 --> 52:01.923
Because you will...
Because you want this for real.

52:01.956 --> 52:03.290
Okay, thank you.

52:03.323 --> 52:04.659
Thank you.

52:04.692 --> 52:06.661
Can we have the necklace now?

52:06.694 --> 52:08.428
Oh, the necklace. Oh.

52:09.831 --> 52:10.898
I almost forgot.

52:10.932 --> 52:12.667
You were gonna
give us for four.

52:12.700 --> 52:14.267
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

52:14.301 --> 52:15.837
- Well, thanks, guys.
- Yeah.

52:15.870 --> 52:16.904
- You're welcome.
- Bye.

52:19.439 --> 52:21.308
Thank you for getting
this for me.

52:22.309 --> 52:24.846
I didn't do much.

52:24.879 --> 52:26.848
- You should probably thank the chickens.
- I know.

52:27.949 --> 52:29.316
- Hey.
- Hey.

52:30.283 --> 52:32.720
You guys just left Bobby.

52:33.521 --> 52:35.355
I'm sorry, Bobby.

52:35.389 --> 52:38.358
All right, well,
welcome to my house.

52:39.794 --> 52:43.230
Uh, and I got some good news.
We got hot water.

52:43.263 --> 52:45.566
- Well, really, for tea?
- No, for a shower.

52:45.600 --> 52:47.969
Um, but we...
Like, only six minutes

52:48.002 --> 52:50.237
'cause we need
the rest for the tea.

52:50.270 --> 52:53.975
Um, and then Bobby wants
to show Luke to some friends.

52:54.008 --> 52:55.275
I'm good.

52:55.308 --> 52:57.377
Okay, sit down.

52:57.411 --> 53:00.515
This is the craziest shower
I've ever...

53:01.582 --> 53:02.917
I feel like an ape.

54:03.611 --> 54:06.346
What if I give it to you?

54:09.784 --> 54:10.852
Okay.

54:15.022 --> 54:16.023
But...

54:17.091 --> 54:18.726
we can't do it in here.

55:12.947 --> 55:14.515
Puppy.

55:22.957 --> 55:24.357
You want a cigarette?

55:31.933 --> 55:33.333
Do you want anything?

55:41.776 --> 55:44.579
Are you, like, angry
all the time or something?

55:44.612 --> 55:46.547
It seems like you are, you know.

55:53.721 --> 55:54.889
You gotta breathe in.

56:02.730 --> 56:04.131
See?

56:04.165 --> 56:06.701
Doesn't always
have to be out.

56:24.619 --> 56:25.720
Where are we going?

56:28.890 --> 56:29.891
Why?

56:36.631 --> 56:37.999
Uh, uh, uh?

56:50.645 --> 56:52.546
(MELODIOUS SONG PLAYING)

59:34.075 --> 59:36.310
<i>The tiger

59:36.343 --> 59:39.380
<i>Then you know it burns.
Is that lucky?</i>

59:39.413 --> 59:41.148
Fuck. Fuck.

59:45.986 --> 59:48.756
<i>Who gave you this shirt?</i>

59:51.358 --> 59:52.960
<i>I would picture
that burning tiger</i>

59:52.993 --> 59:54.962
<i>with the one
on the shirt you stole.</i>

59:54.995 --> 59:57.932
<i>That's not why
it's lucky, though.</i>

59:57.965 --> 1:00:01.302

the shirt that put me to sleep.</i>

1:00:01.335 --> 1:00:03.037

1:00:03.070 --> 1:00:05.005

- Yeah.
- Noah's Ark is lost.

1:00:55.456 --> 1:00:57.258
Let's all swim.

1:04:09.350 --> 1:04:10.384
Howdy.

1:04:11.352 --> 1:04:12.486
Hello.

1:04:14.021 --> 1:04:15.923
I need a safe place to stay.

1:04:17.424 --> 1:04:20.894
Hey, hey, I got water,
beef jerky, granola bars.

1:04:20.928 --> 1:04:23.631
I know your story.

1:04:24.666 --> 1:04:27.101
We're all waiting here, man.

1:04:27.134 --> 1:04:29.269
You need a room or what?

1:04:29.303 --> 1:04:32.607
How many bags you got?
I can take them for you.

1:04:38.946 --> 1:04:41.048
I got a sick daughter
who's with a boyfriend

1:04:41.081 --> 1:04:44.218
and this girl
who lost her voice.

1:04:44.652 --> 1:04:46.286
You seen them?

1:04:46.320 --> 1:04:48.690
I see a lot of people
check in here.

1:04:48.723 --> 1:04:50.592
A lot of them can't talk.

1:04:50.625 --> 1:04:53.193
Do you know where you are?
You need a map?

1:04:53.227 --> 1:04:57.297
Yeah. Yeah.
You know, I lived here once.

1:04:57.331 --> 1:04:58.999
How long have you
been stuck here?

1:04:59.032 --> 1:05:01.301
Oh, I'm not stuck here.
I like it here.

1:05:01.335 --> 1:05:04.271
Not the motel, but this city.

1:05:05.072 --> 1:05:06.541
What's you name, Jack?

1:05:08.510 --> 1:05:09.943
Name's Joe.

1:05:11.613 --> 1:05:13.380
You need a ride to your camp?

1:05:14.982 --> 1:05:17.951
What, do you want to give me
a ride to my camp or what?

1:05:17.985 --> 1:05:20.722
- I do indeed. I do indeed.
- You do indeed.

1:05:20.755 --> 1:05:21.955
I do indeed.

1:05:22.757 --> 1:05:24.458
How do you do, mister?

1:05:25.259 --> 1:05:26.594
We got a mission.

1:05:27.695 --> 1:05:29.263
I need a partner.

1:05:31.131 --> 1:05:32.466
I need details.

1:05:33.434 --> 1:05:34.569
Let's get.

1:05:35.703 --> 1:05:36.937
Fuck.

1:05:42.109 --> 1:05:44.344
Oh, fuck, we're all gonna burn
in hell, man.

1:05:44.378 --> 1:05:46.280
Ow!

1:05:46.313 --> 1:05:48.115
Just a matter of time, fellas.

1:05:48.148 --> 1:05:50.050
Almost there.

1:05:50.083 --> 1:05:52.453
Burn in hell!

1:05:52.486 --> 1:05:55.355
Or fly off to heaven, you know.
We got a choice.

1:05:55.389 --> 1:05:58.258
One way ticket is fair enough, though.

1:05:58.292 --> 1:06:00.227
One way ticket is fair enough.

1:06:00.260 --> 1:06:02.496
I'll save you a seat.

1:06:02.530 --> 1:06:04.131
Fair enough, see.

1:06:04.164 --> 1:06:06.166
You ain't gotta pay for it.

1:06:06.200 --> 1:06:10.070
Just save me a seat, brother,
or a train to anywhere.

1:06:15.275 --> 1:06:17.244
Look at these fucking idiots.

1:06:20.113 --> 1:06:23.651
Look, you did your mission.
Let me do mine.

1:06:24.619 --> 1:06:26.621
I see.

1:06:26.654 --> 1:06:28.723
It sounds like you're trying
to make money.

1:06:32.359 --> 1:06:36.396
I'm just trying to get these drugs
to people who deserve to live.

1:06:36.430 --> 1:06:41.536
Not... people
at the end of the road.

1:06:41.569 --> 1:06:44.071
Listen, you...
You've been away a long time, you know.

1:06:44.104 --> 1:06:47.542
You've got a lot of people
who wanna see you and shit.

1:06:47.575 --> 1:06:51.613
It's been a long time, and I have changed.

1:06:53.280 --> 1:06:55.048
How's that?

1:06:55.082 --> 1:06:58.653
I'm joking, man.

1:06:58.686 --> 1:07:01.355
Let's go get the fucking meds, man.

1:07:01.388 --> 1:07:03.190
We're all just waiting...

1:07:05.693 --> 1:07:07.461
for some...

1:07:09.162 --> 1:07:13.768
For a rich white kid to die.

1:07:13.801 --> 1:07:16.036
It's crazy, but it's true.

1:07:18.506 --> 1:07:19.807
Our time will come.

1:07:20.508 --> 1:07:21.676
I guarantee it.

1:07:21.709 --> 1:07:22.744
Oh, boy.

1:07:42.129 --> 1:07:43.631
If you had people here...

1:07:43.665 --> 1:07:46.834
Sometimes... Somebody tries to steal
them 'cause they don't have shoes,

1:07:46.868 --> 1:07:50.638
and I'm like, "You can't take my...
My walls."

1:07:50.672 --> 1:07:53.407
Um, did you see
my homecoming pics?

1:07:55.309 --> 1:07:58.312
They're, like,
all from homecoming.

1:07:59.479 --> 1:08:00.548
Yeah.

1:08:00.582 --> 1:08:03.417
- You know, um, Tammie?
- Mmm-hmm.

1:08:03.450 --> 1:08:10.123
She has, like, a family album
with photos of the same people

1:08:10.157 --> 1:08:12.125
in different times and places.

1:08:14.394 --> 1:08:15.897
I wish I had
that instead, but...

1:08:15.930 --> 1:08:17.599
No, these are cool.

1:08:17.632 --> 1:08:19.299
I've never seen
homecoming photos

1:08:19.333 --> 1:08:22.604
without, like, all the makeup
and the dresses.

1:08:22.637 --> 1:08:23.638
Makeup?

1:08:26.239 --> 1:08:29.777
Yeah, like, um,
lipstick or... blush.

1:08:29.811 --> 1:08:32.614
- You don't know...
- No. What? What?

1:08:32.647 --> 1:08:36.450
It's like...
Like a face paint or something.

1:08:39.286 --> 1:08:45.192
But why makeup our faces
when they're already maked up?

1:08:45.225 --> 1:08:46.728
You're right. I don't under...

1:08:46.761 --> 1:08:49.463
People do it to, like,
look different or... Hey.

1:08:49.964 --> 1:08:51.532
Um...

1:08:51.566 --> 1:08:52.767
Ooh. Well...

1:08:54.434 --> 1:08:56.503
I wanna try it.

1:08:56.537 --> 1:08:57.772
We can do it tonight.

1:08:57.805 --> 1:08:59.406
What's tonight?

1:08:59.907 --> 1:09:01.274
Homecoming night!

1:09:01.308 --> 1:09:02.442
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

1:09:02.476 --> 1:09:03.911
- I love homecoming.
- You do?

1:09:03.945 --> 1:09:05.412
Okay, sweet.

1:09:05.445 --> 1:09:06.614
You cannot wear
that shirt, though.

1:09:07.447 --> 1:09:09.884
Well, he burned
his other one.

1:09:09.917 --> 1:09:11.385
- His lucky shirt.
- Wh...

1:09:11.418 --> 1:09:13.755
Why would you burn it?

1:09:13.788 --> 1:09:15.890
It was unlucky.

1:09:15.923 --> 1:09:19.794
Okay, but why'd you burn it when
you could have just given it away?

1:09:20.895 --> 1:09:22.730
Hmm.

1:09:22.764 --> 1:09:25.667
What do you have over there?
Maybe you have something for him?

1:09:25.700 --> 1:09:27.035
Um, yes.

1:09:27.068 --> 1:09:31.973
Okay. Uh, feel free to, like,
put on anything, touch anything.

1:09:32.006 --> 1:09:35.576
Whatever you want is...
It's yours.

1:09:35.610 --> 1:09:38.278
Um, do you think
I should wear that?

1:09:38.311 --> 1:09:40.480
Doesn't look like there's
many male options in here.

1:09:40.515 --> 1:09:41.983
We're gonna
find something.

1:09:42.016 --> 1:09:43.051
- I don't think I've ever worn it.
- Doesn't matter, I guess.

1:09:43.084 --> 1:09:45.887
There's no difference.
You can wear...

1:09:45.920 --> 1:09:47.889
I like that shirt...

1:09:49.489 --> 1:09:52.292
I always find
so much inspiration, like,

1:09:52.325 --> 1:09:55.362
for my dresses
when I look at these pictures.

1:09:55.395 --> 1:09:57.965
It kinda makes me sick, Emerald.

1:09:57.999 --> 1:09:59.867
Did you make them, or did...

1:09:59.901 --> 1:10:02.235
- Yes.
- Oh.

1:10:02.269 --> 1:10:03.604
I'm sorry.

1:10:03.638 --> 1:10:06.339
- It's all right.
- Is this a homecoming shirt?

1:10:06.373 --> 1:10:07.608
That's the homecoming shirt.

1:10:07.642 --> 1:10:09.577
Leave a little bit
of the chest hair out.

1:10:15.717 --> 1:10:17.785
- I saw you with Blake.
- Oh.

1:10:19.721 --> 1:10:20.988
Mmm-hmm.

1:10:28.896 --> 1:10:33.568
<i>And this, people do
to look different?</i>

1:10:33.601 --> 1:10:34.702
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

1:10:38.039 --> 1:10:40.007
<i>Emerald,
when does the dance start?</i>

1:10:40.041 --> 1:10:42.810
<i>It starts
when we get there.</i>

1:10:45.046 --> 1:10:47.849
<i>And then
see the stars</i>

1:10:47.882 --> 1:10:52.285
<i>and point to the shooting stars
and the constellations.</i>

1:10:52.319 --> 1:10:55.757
<i>And then see the sunrise
over the beach.</i>

1:10:57.925 --> 1:10:59.961
<i>It's burning red hot.</i>

1:11:01.529 --> 1:11:02.964
Welcome. Welcome.

1:11:05.566 --> 1:11:06.834
Choose a card.

1:11:11.038 --> 1:11:13.641
<i>We should probably
get going soon, though...</i>

1:11:14.976 --> 1:11:16.878
<i>so we get the whole night.</i>

1:11:17.845 --> 1:11:19.312
Oh, my.

1:11:19.346 --> 1:11:21.314
Where are you going?

1:11:21.348 --> 1:11:23.551
Um, I'm not sure
right now.

1:11:23.584 --> 1:11:24.919
- Can you tell me?
- Interesting.

1:11:24.952 --> 1:11:26.821
I can't.
The cards don't even know.

1:11:26.854 --> 1:11:29.090
You pulled a card of confusion.

1:11:29.123 --> 1:11:30.992
The Lord of Swiftness.

1:11:32.627 --> 1:11:33.961
You're on the move.

1:11:42.103 --> 1:11:43.303
Hey!

1:11:45.840 --> 1:11:47.008
Hey! Hey!

1:11:49.644 --> 1:11:50.711
What is it?

1:11:55.850 --> 1:11:57.484
Oops.

1:11:58.886 --> 1:11:59.887
I feel like a doctor.

1:12:02.657 --> 1:12:04.525
<i>Or a painter.</i>

1:12:05.927 --> 1:12:08.763
<i>It's so nice to have people
in the house.</i>

1:12:09.864 --> 1:12:11.098
Mmm.

1:12:12.767 --> 1:12:15.603
<i>I love picking seashells.</i>

1:12:15.636 --> 1:12:18.438
I feel like I could fall asleep.

1:12:21.042 --> 1:12:23.778
<i>Is there someone there
that will take a picture of us?</i>

1:12:23.811 --> 1:12:24.946
<i>I hope so.</i>

1:12:27.815 --> 1:12:30.518
<i>I need one for my collection.</i>

1:12:30.551 --> 1:12:33.855
<i>And this time it...
It will be me coming with real people</i>

1:12:33.888 --> 1:12:35.990
and not just the dogs.

1:12:37.091 --> 1:12:38.559
Luke?

1:12:40.862 --> 1:12:43.030
Luke. Wake up.

1:12:43.064 --> 1:12:44.464
<i>With the sun,
there's fire behind you,</i>

1:12:44.497 --> 1:12:48.435
<i>and sometimes you tend to get burned
by your own fire and strength.</i>

1:12:48.468 --> 1:12:49.871
<i>You can't let that happen.</i>

1:12:49.904 --> 1:12:51.505
<i>Pull another one.</i>

1:12:52.506 --> 1:12:53.507
Go ahead.

1:13:06.020 --> 1:13:08.189
Wow. This is such
an interesting reading.

1:13:08.222 --> 1:13:10.191
You got The High Priestess.

1:13:10.224 --> 1:13:12.894
So, The High Priestess
is a very interesting card.

1:13:12.927 --> 1:13:15.196
Uh, divine femininity.

1:13:15.229 --> 1:13:17.932
There's a lot of power
in the direction you're going.

1:13:17.965 --> 1:13:22.103
Even though you may be lost,
you'll find your path, or it will find you.

1:13:23.470 --> 1:13:26.741
You guys seem like you're gonna
need some guidance on your trip...

1:13:27.308 --> 1:13:28.709
wherever that may be.

1:13:36.483 --> 1:13:37.919
<i>I don't know,
sometimes I make up stories</i>

1:13:37.952 --> 1:13:41.222
about someone I've never
even met before, like, um...

1:13:41.255 --> 1:13:44.659
I don't know, it's not real.
Just something special about them.

1:13:44.692 --> 1:13:46.227
It's like a fantasy.

1:13:46.260 --> 1:13:47.895
- A fantasy?
- Yeah.

1:13:47.929 --> 1:13:50.765
Blink once for "no"
and twice for "yes."

1:13:51.198 --> 1:13:52.733
A fantasy love?

1:13:52.767 --> 1:13:53.768
Yeah.

1:13:54.268 --> 1:13:55.736
I wanna try that.

1:13:55.770 --> 1:13:57.772
Do you like eating human food?

1:13:59.974 --> 1:14:01.542
Are you in love?

1:14:02.677 --> 1:14:05.112
With the fantasy one
or the real one?

1:14:08.516 --> 1:14:11.852
Can you howl?

The God's honest truth

and you do this to me.

1:15:55.689 --> 1:15:58.092
You owe me everything,
and I continue to die for you.

1:16:03.197 --> 1:16:04.198
Miss.

1:16:08.002 --> 1:16:10.838
Well, I just wanna know...
I wanna get on your team,

1:16:10.871 --> 1:16:13.207
'cause I think we can
kinda work something out.

1:16:14.942 --> 1:16:16.644
Did you burn those meds?

1:16:16.677 --> 1:16:17.912
Did you burn 'em in the car?

1:16:17.945 --> 1:16:19.380
Would l really burn them?

1:16:19.413 --> 1:16:22.616
- You think I would burn them?
- I didn't believe that you'd burn them.

1:16:22.650 --> 1:16:24.285
Um, that's Jack.

1:16:27.021 --> 1:16:28.956
We have... We have to go.
We have to go now.

1:16:44.205 --> 1:16:46.107
Just tell me. Come on.

1:17:05.192 --> 1:17:06.894
Oh, my God.

1:17:06.927 --> 1:17:08.195
Pack up our stuff.

1:17:31.085 --> 1:17:35.356
Hey, let's take off the makeup.

1:17:35.389 --> 1:17:37.324
I don't really think I liked it.

1:17:37.691 --> 1:17:40.694
Okay, um...

1:17:41.929 --> 1:17:43.197
Thank you.

1:17:59.213 --> 1:18:00.681
What are you doing?

1:18:02.850 --> 1:18:06.253
We're just getting ready
for bed, I think.

1:18:06.287 --> 1:18:08.122
What are you talking about?
We have to go.

1:18:08.889 --> 1:18:10.391
No...

1:18:11.458 --> 1:18:12.960
No.

1:18:13.394 --> 1:18:14.461
We have to wait.

1:18:14.495 --> 1:18:16.730
What are
we waiting for, Emerald?

1:18:19.099 --> 1:18:21.435
I have to go find Luke.

1:18:21.468 --> 1:18:24.371
- What the hell just happened...
- Luke is sick, okay?

1:18:26.774 --> 1:18:29.009
<i>But not like us.</i>

1:18:29.043 --> 1:18:32.813
The bad kind of sick.
The forgotten kind of sick.

1:18:32.846 --> 1:18:34.715
Wake up, sick.

1:18:39.486 --> 1:18:40.655
Where are the fucking pills?

1:18:40.689 --> 1:18:44.458
We know you didn't burn them.
You didn't burn them meds.

1:18:44.491 --> 1:18:46.827
You're a fucking thief!

1:18:46.860 --> 1:18:48.195
They're in the car, man.

1:18:48.229 --> 1:18:50.798
See, you know,
you burned that fucking car.

1:18:50.831 --> 1:18:53.867
My mother, she was sick, too,
so she...

1:18:53.901 --> 1:18:57.204
She went into the bathroom,
right there, where you just were,

1:18:57.238 --> 1:19:01.976
um, and...
And shot herself with a .38.

1:19:02.611 --> 1:19:04.845
<i>Yeah.</i>

1:19:04.878 --> 1:19:07.214
<i>She didn't die right away.</i>

1:19:07.248 --> 1:19:14.121
Then, I think I was there for...
For two hours before my dad found us.

1:19:16.190 --> 1:19:21.862
But it was me alive
and her dead.

1:19:23.063 --> 1:19:25.833
He... He thinks that I did it.

1:19:25.866 --> 1:19:30.104
<i>Yeah, he says I'm the reason for,
you know, putting poison in her.</i>

1:19:30.137 --> 1:19:32.906
<i>That I've been killing her
for nine months.</i>

1:19:32.940 --> 1:19:34.108
<i>Yeah.</i>

1:19:35.075 --> 1:19:39.346
But my dad also told me that...
That God...

1:19:39.380 --> 1:19:42.883
He makes us all in these
big, big batches, right?

1:19:42.916 --> 1:19:47.955
<i>But he lets one or two stars
just slip by, you know.</i>

1:19:47.988 --> 1:19:49.823
<i>And they're...</i>

1:19:49.857 --> 1:19:53.861
<i>They're just too magical
for this world.</i>

1:19:54.962 --> 1:19:57.364
<i>They're too bright, even.</i>

1:19:57.398 --> 1:20:03.937
<i>And they're so sensitive
that they just burn up quickly.</i>

1:20:10.612 --> 1:20:12.179
Stop. Stop.

1:20:15.949 --> 1:20:16.950
Do it.

1:20:18.385 --> 1:20:19.887
Yeah, that's right.

1:20:19.920 --> 1:20:21.922
- Do it.
- No, man, I'm not gonna shoot.

1:20:21.955 --> 1:20:23.157
Shoot me.

1:20:24.425 --> 1:20:25.560
Do it!

1:20:27.127 --> 1:20:28.262
Do it!

1:20:51.985 --> 1:20:54.054
<i>I used to
think that...</i>

1:20:54.088 --> 1:20:58.258
<i>That it must have been God who put
me in her stomach to poison her.</i>

1:21:03.063 --> 1:21:08.502
<i>But then, I think my dad
chose to poison himself by...</i>

1:21:08.536 --> 1:21:12.206
<i>By putting a needle
in his arm.</i>

1:21:29.624 --> 1:21:33.327
But I also know that I'm...
I'm not poison.

1:21:34.662 --> 1:21:35.996
<i>You know, maybe...</i>

1:21:37.398 --> 1:21:40.535
<i>Maybe I am just like her.</i>

1:21:41.335 --> 1:21:44.639
<i>That I am so sensitive</i>

1:21:44.672 --> 1:21:48.342
<i>that it makes all the other people
that surround me, uncomfortable,</i>

1:21:48.375 --> 1:21:50.978
because my bright magic
comes at times

1:21:51.011 --> 1:21:52.580
when it is truly needed,
you know.

1:21:55.717 --> 1:21:59.086
But it's that same magic
that burns itself up.

1:22:10.130 --> 1:22:13.367
<i>And so, we need to take care
of those people.</i>

1:22:13.400 --> 1:22:16.403
And when it's their time to
burn, we have to let them burn.

1:22:38.660 --> 1:22:40.461
I'm gonna go, um...

1:22:43.598 --> 1:22:45.332
<i>find Luke, okay?</i>

1:22:45.365 --> 1:22:48.101
Luke has already left you.

1:22:48.135 --> 1:22:49.604
You don't know that.

1:22:51.071 --> 1:22:52.406
Bobby knows.

1:22:53.641 --> 1:22:56.176
<i>What do you...
What do you mean?</i>

1:22:57.579 --> 1:22:59.146
<i>We both know.</i>

1:23:21.536 --> 1:23:22.737
<i>Hey.</i>

1:23:22.770 --> 1:23:25.072
<i>Bobby, what are you doing?</i>

1:23:27.074 --> 1:23:30.244
What are you guys doing?
What the fuck are you doing?

1:23:30.277 --> 1:23:31.613
What the fuck are you doing?

1:23:49.363 --> 1:23:50.497
Luke.

1:23:52.199 --> 1:23:53.367
Luke.

1:23:53.400 --> 1:23:56.203
Who's Luke?
The kid from the pharmacy?

1:23:58.238 --> 1:24:00.542
Like, you just fucking left me
in there in that clinic.

1:24:01.475 --> 1:24:04.679
You put me in there.

1:24:08.683 --> 1:24:10.117
Well,
if you're here to find him,

1:24:10.150 --> 1:24:11.753
the doctor
already took care of him.

1:24:15.188 --> 1:24:16.390
Luke...

1:24:35.677 --> 1:24:37.177
No. No, no, no. Wait. Wait.

1:25:34.869 --> 1:25:37.471
<i>You need to get out.
I told you last time...</i>

1:26:19.279 --> 1:26:21.549
<i>It was given to me
by someone special.</i>

1:26:21.582 --> 1:26:23.785
<i>When I forgot the poem,
the person was gone.</i>

1:26:24.585 --> 1:26:25.887
<i>I had it memorized.</i>

1:27:16.804 --> 1:27:18.506
<i>Just say a part of it.</i>

1:27:19.807 --> 1:27:21.509
<i>I remember
the rest of the poem.</i>

1:27:22.877 --> 1:27:24.545
<i>"And what shoulder & what art</i>

1:27:24.579 --> 1:27:26.514
<i>"Could twist the sinews
of thy heart?</i>

1:27:26.547 --> 1:27:28.281
<i>"And when thy heart
began to beat</i>

1:27:28.315 --> 1:27:30.685
<i>"What dread hand?
& what dread feet?</i>

1:27:30.718 --> 1:27:32.486
<i>"What the hammer?
what the chain</i>

1:27:32.520 --> 1:27:34.555
<i>"In what furnace
was thy brain?</i>

1:27:34.589 --> 1:27:36.924
<i>"What the anvil?
what dread grasp</i>

1:27:36.958 --> 1:27:39.459
<i>"Dare its deadly terrors clasp!</i>

1:27:39.493 --> 1:27:41.028
<i>"Smile his work to see?</i>

1:27:41.062 --> 1:27:43.831
<i>"Did he who made
the Lamb make thee?</i>

1:27:43.865 --> 1:27:45.733
<i>"Tyger Tyger burning bright</i>

1:27:45.767 --> 1:27:47.769
<i>"In the forests of the night</i>

1:27:47.802 --> 1:27:49.537
<i>"What immortal hand or eye</i>

1:27:49.570 --> 1:27:51.806
<i>"Dare frame
thy fearful symmetry?"</i>

1:28:55.770 --> 1:28:57.038
See you next week.

1:29:02.143 --> 1:29:03.410
Blake.

1:29:03.711 --> 1:29:04.812
Yeah.

1:29:09.650 --> 1:29:12.019
Blake, the doctor's ready
for you. Come on back.

1:29:16.023 --> 1:29:17.058
You want me
to go with you?

1:29:17.091 --> 1:29:18.659
No, um, I'm good.

1:29:20.828 --> 1:29:23.965
Okay, I get that.

1:29:23.998 --> 1:29:26.968
- Those people... Those people have done this 40 times.
- Those people...

1:29:27.001 --> 1:29:28.870
- They have.
- Where's the mute girl going?

1:29:28.903 --> 1:29:30.171
There are multiple
people that come in here

1:29:30.204 --> 1:29:32.573
time and time again,
trying to get their prescription pills.

1:29:32.607 --> 1:29:35.843
Take these pills twice
a day and drink plenty of water.

1:29:35.877 --> 1:29:37.612
I have everything
that you need.

1:29:37.645 --> 1:29:38.980
I know. WOMAN 2: Blake,
the doctor's waiting for you.

1:29:39.013 --> 1:29:40.548
You can't leave yet.

1:29:40.581 --> 1:29:42.183
It just
doesn't work that way.

1:29:42.216 --> 1:29:45.418
I've given you the lab results 20
times now. Can't you, just this once...

1:29:45.452 --> 1:29:47.521
- Remember, I came here last week.
- I can't, this once.

1:29:47.555 --> 1:29:51.626
'Cause if I this once with you,
I have to this once with everybody.

1:30:25.159 --> 1:30:26.594
What the fuck are you doing?
