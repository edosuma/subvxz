00:01.180 --> 00:03.710
I don't get why you're boxing up
this wine I recommended.

00:03.735 --> 00:06.285
It's got everything you need...
grapes, et cetera.

00:06.318 --> 00:08.921
Because, Miggy, according
to this letter from the FDA,

00:08.946 --> 00:10.256
this wine with goat on the bottle

00:10.288 --> 00:11.905
also has goat <i> in</i> the bottle.

00:11.945 --> 00:13.980
The hair or the meat?
How much goat we talking?

00:14.013 --> 00:15.582
Isn't <i> any</i> amount of goat bad?

00:15.614 --> 00:17.250
- Mm...
- Look, we're not doing this.

00:17.283 --> 00:18.718
- I gotta get it off the shelves.
- 'Kay.

00:18.751 --> 00:21.087
And now Rory's giving me
his "Where's my snack?" eyes.

00:21.120 --> 00:22.321
Daddy hungry.

00:22.355 --> 00:26.493
There she is... Poppy,
the May to my December.

00:26.525 --> 00:29.228
There <i> he</i> is... Douglas, my sexy, eh...

00:29.262 --> 00:30.431
lighthouse.

00:30.463 --> 00:32.399
Hey, why don't we, uh, skip out of here

00:32.432 --> 00:34.033
and spend the afternoon together, huh?

00:34.067 --> 00:36.811
I gotta blow off steam
after this three-day work week.

00:36.836 --> 00:38.104
I would love to,

00:38.137 --> 00:40.106
but I've got a busy day
carting Rory around.

00:40.140 --> 00:42.109
Plus, now I've got a goat situation.

00:42.142 --> 00:43.210
There's hoof in the wine.

00:43.243 --> 00:44.411
Yeah.

00:44.444 --> 00:45.712
Okay. That's my cue.

00:45.744 --> 00:49.115
I'm gonna go to the club
and maybe hop in a golf cart,

00:49.149 --> 00:51.518
nod off, and just see where I wake up.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.020
- Mm.
- You know, rich guy weekend.

00:53.052 --> 00:54.454
Mm-hmm. Bye.

00:54.487 --> 00:56.089
Ah, sir, a moment?

00:56.122 --> 00:57.957
Thanks. Hi.

00:57.990 --> 00:59.292
Couldn't help but overhear

00:59.326 --> 01:02.628
you totally dropping the ball
with your girlfriend!

01:02.661 --> 01:05.063
She clearly needs your help here.

01:05.096 --> 01:06.599
If she wanted help, she would've asked.

01:06.632 --> 01:07.634
That's what grown-ups do.

01:07.667 --> 01:09.736
Shush! Sweet child.

01:09.769 --> 01:11.737
- Shush.
- Don't shush me.

01:11.771 --> 01:13.239
My mother would never ask for help.

01:13.272 --> 01:14.807
That's not who she is.

01:14.840 --> 01:17.310
But go ahead. End up like Davey.

01:17.343 --> 01:19.445
- Who's Davey?
- Who's Davey?

01:19.478 --> 01:21.548
Her last serious boyfriend.

01:21.581 --> 01:24.084
He was great.
Tall like you, maybe taller.

01:24.117 --> 01:25.618
Oh, taller than me is too tall.

01:25.652 --> 01:29.289
Anyway, he never helped her,
and she never asked him to,

01:29.322 --> 01:30.557
so now he's dead.

01:30.590 --> 01:31.625
To her.

01:31.658 --> 01:33.659
But... I get it.

01:33.692 --> 01:35.628
You're totally incapable of pitching in.

01:35.662 --> 01:37.131
Incapable? It's a choice.

01:37.164 --> 01:39.966
That's why I hired a 60-year-old
butler 30 years ago.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.135
Well, you keep those hands clean, Davey.

01:42.168 --> 01:43.269
I mean, Douglas.

01:43.302 --> 01:45.004
Damn you!

01:45.037 --> 01:46.606
Poppy?

01:46.640 --> 01:48.242
Uh, let me help you out.

01:48.275 --> 01:50.109
Why don't I take Rory for the day?

01:50.143 --> 01:52.679
Really? No, no, no, no. I could
never ask you to do that.

01:52.712 --> 01:55.015
Eh, you're not <i> asking.</i>
I'm <i> offering.</i> Come on.

01:55.048 --> 01:56.483
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

01:56.516 --> 01:57.784
Because I can just... I can...

01:57.816 --> 01:59.619
No, really, it'll be a breeze.

01:59.653 --> 02:03.757
And I can tell that you have
your hands full with, uh...

02:03.790 --> 02:04.925
Ohhh, Poppy.

02:04.957 --> 02:07.461
I-I think my tum-tums
got the rumb-rumbs!

02:07.493 --> 02:09.830
But it's okay. I'm gonna wash it
down with some more wine.

02:09.862 --> 02:11.465
No, Miggy.

02:13.651 --> 02:15.227
02x11 - <i>The Angie-Man</i>

02:16.823 --> 02:18.425
Ohh. 40 years. Wow.

02:18.459 --> 02:19.930
Your parents have been married
for, like,

02:19.955 --> 02:21.529
over two-thirds of Douglas.

02:21.561 --> 02:22.863
Yeah, if you'd told me a month ago

02:22.896 --> 02:24.265
we'd be celebrating their anniversary,

02:24.299 --> 02:25.700
I would've said "Buzzer sound!"

02:25.733 --> 02:26.935
'Cause I had a really sore throat

02:26.967 --> 02:28.536
and it would've hurt
to make an actual buzzer sound.

02:28.568 --> 02:30.571
But also because I thought
their marriage was doomed.

02:30.604 --> 02:31.705
Right. Right.

02:31.739 --> 02:33.208
Because when you were
giving my son the...

02:33.240 --> 02:34.541
sex talk, you learned...

02:34.574 --> 02:36.411
A fact about sex that I <i> didn't</i> know...

02:36.443 --> 02:38.713
my father was having it
with someone besides my mother.

02:38.745 --> 02:39.880
And not just anyone.

02:39.913 --> 02:42.049
His fellow health teacher,
Ms. Sugars Hawthorne.

02:42.083 --> 02:43.752
Ah, two health teachers.

02:43.785 --> 02:46.988
Do you think it was, like,
super hot or super clinical?

02:47.020 --> 02:50.125
I confronted him about it,
and he talked to my mom,

02:50.157 --> 02:51.458
and clearly, they worked things out

02:51.491 --> 02:53.494
because here we are,
celebrating their love.

02:53.527 --> 02:55.829
I don't trust anyone
who works through problems.

02:55.863 --> 02:57.065
It's not a real thing.

02:57.097 --> 02:58.399
But I do love your parents.

02:58.432 --> 02:59.601
They're the only people

02:59.633 --> 03:01.469
still using technology
that I can help with.

03:01.501 --> 03:03.070
Yeah. Well, they really love <i> you.</i>

03:03.103 --> 03:04.571
And the free tech support.

03:04.604 --> 03:06.407
Hey, you should actually stay
for the party.

03:06.441 --> 03:08.943
Ah, you don't need me.
I mean, won't Tracy be here?

03:08.976 --> 03:11.645
No, she got called into work.
A big story broke.

03:11.679 --> 03:14.249
Apparently, a group of cats took
over a sushi restaurant.

03:14.281 --> 03:15.416
It's pretty funny.

03:15.449 --> 03:16.650
It's an anniversary party.

03:16.684 --> 03:18.319
It's gonna be all couples. Smells datey.

03:18.352 --> 03:20.321
I'm gonna head out.

03:20.354 --> 03:23.191
I came, I saw, helped set up,

03:23.223 --> 03:25.859
- ate all the mini grilled cheeses.
- Thank you for that.

03:25.893 --> 03:27.929
- This is a wrap on D'Amato.
- All right.

03:27.961 --> 03:29.130
Look who's here!

03:29.162 --> 03:30.698
- Whoo!
- Your two favorite palindromes...

03:30.732 --> 03:32.032
Mom and Dad!

03:33.067 --> 03:34.703
I'll take one large hug, please,

03:34.735 --> 03:35.804
hold the pickles.

03:35.836 --> 03:36.704
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

03:36.738 --> 03:37.938
Hey.

03:37.971 --> 03:38.939
Ohhhh!

03:38.972 --> 03:40.007
Happy anniversary.

03:40.041 --> 03:41.276
Yeah.

03:41.309 --> 03:42.276
Ohh!

03:42.310 --> 03:43.944
Look at you.

03:43.977 --> 03:46.214
- Oh, it's good to see you.
- You, too.

03:46.246 --> 03:48.549
Listen, my Garmin is on the fritz again.

03:48.583 --> 03:50.352
- Again? Ugh.
- I know. Yeah.

03:50.384 --> 03:51.731
What's with the purse?

03:51.756 --> 03:53.154
You're gonna stay for the party,
aren't you?

03:53.186 --> 03:54.722
Oh. Uh...

03:56.390 --> 03:57.925
Uh...

03:59.160 --> 04:00.395
Yeah. Sure.

04:00.428 --> 04:01.829
Of course.

04:01.863 --> 04:04.366
I mean, who am I? Meghan Markle?
Where do I gotta be?

04:06.067 --> 04:08.336
Aah! Staying!

04:09.370 --> 04:11.563
She just threw it over there.

04:11.594 --> 04:12.874
What's wrong with Tony?

04:12.906 --> 04:14.508
Cassandra dumped him again.

04:14.542 --> 04:16.577
This time, she ain't coming back.

04:16.611 --> 04:19.714
I know that look. Tony's in pain.

04:19.745 --> 04:22.083
There's only one way
to make that man whole again.

04:22.116 --> 04:23.518
He needs a woman.

04:23.551 --> 04:24.886
Should we call his mom?

04:24.919 --> 04:27.155
Tony used to babysit <i> Elvis.</i>

04:27.188 --> 04:29.591
You think his mom's still alive?

04:29.624 --> 04:31.025
I'll get the shovels.

04:31.058 --> 04:32.360
Won't be the first time.

04:32.393 --> 04:34.863
Ladies, I'm not talking about a mom.

04:34.895 --> 04:37.265
I'm talking about
a special kind of friend.

04:37.297 --> 04:41.001
I don't mean to be crass,
but we need to get this man...

04:41.035 --> 04:42.237
hugged.

04:42.270 --> 04:44.773
Well, no one's gonna hug him
looking like <i> that.</i>

04:46.573 --> 04:47.841
Come on.

04:47.874 --> 04:50.711
Let's put in a new backsplash
and flip this house.

04:50.744 --> 04:52.112
All right. We did it.

04:52.145 --> 04:53.181
Three farmer's markets,

04:53.213 --> 04:55.015
two laps around the ointment district,

04:55.049 --> 04:58.219
and a very confusing stop
at a Judaica store.

04:58.251 --> 05:00.754
Okay, they have <i> the</i> best candles,

05:00.787 --> 05:02.556
and you just know nothing
about atmosphere.

05:02.590 --> 05:05.626
Yeah? Why don't you tell that
to my $30,000 chandelier,

05:05.660 --> 05:07.095
you scrub?

05:07.128 --> 05:08.530
I'm exhausted.

05:08.563 --> 05:10.932
How long have I been
watching you? Two, three weeks?

05:10.965 --> 05:12.467
- It's been four hours.
- Really?

05:12.499 --> 05:14.869
I don't know how
your mom does this every day.

05:14.902 --> 05:17.038
All right, here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna take a soft 20.

05:17.071 --> 05:18.907
Do you have a <i> Wall Street
Journal</i> lying around?

05:18.939 --> 05:20.707
Don't you dare check the markets now.

05:20.741 --> 05:22.710
You still have to take me
to go get my new tap shoes.

05:22.742 --> 05:24.044
Okay, now, I know for a fact

05:24.078 --> 05:26.448
you have seven different pairs
in your closet.

05:26.480 --> 05:28.248
I've turned on them all.

05:28.282 --> 05:29.417
And they on <i> me.</i>

05:29.450 --> 05:31.486
Well, then you're gonna
have to dance barefoot.

05:31.518 --> 05:33.220
You can make the sounds with your mouth.

05:33.253 --> 05:35.989
"Click-clack-tap." See? It's easy.

05:36.023 --> 05:37.926
Well, guess I should be grateful.

05:37.958 --> 05:39.626
Least I didn't get kidnapped.

05:39.660 --> 05:42.597
Let me just text my mom.

05:42.629 --> 05:45.432
Hey, Siri, send message to Poppy.

05:45.465 --> 05:47.167
"Douglas dropping the ball, period.

05:47.200 --> 05:48.570
Couldn't provide help, period.

05:48.602 --> 05:50.304
Suggestions, question mark."

05:50.338 --> 05:52.172
A-A-At ease, Sarah.

05:52.205 --> 05:53.741
All right, fine.

05:53.773 --> 05:56.343
You want shoes? I know the guy
at the Ferragamo store.

05:56.376 --> 05:58.780
He can get us the illegal stuff.

05:58.813 --> 06:00.014
Oh, no, no, no.

06:00.047 --> 06:02.015
I only get <i> my</i> dance shoes

06:02.049 --> 06:05.487
from Foot Clothes for
Number One Best Music Moving.

06:06.653 --> 06:08.188
It's foreign-owned.

06:10.191 --> 06:12.193
Well, thank you all for coming.

06:12.225 --> 06:16.029
Uh, boy, being married to me
for all those years,

06:16.063 --> 06:18.199
well, it couldn't have been easy.

06:18.232 --> 06:19.333
No.

06:19.366 --> 06:22.338
My, uh, hair-plug trial
nearly ruined us.

06:23.371 --> 06:25.472
Uh, my weight fluctuates 70 pounds

06:25.506 --> 06:27.375
in each direction every six months,

06:27.407 --> 06:29.443
and I don't go to Burning Man,

06:29.477 --> 06:31.880
but I talk about it...

06:31.912 --> 06:33.347
all the time.

06:33.381 --> 06:35.183
Oh, and also, honey,

06:35.215 --> 06:37.684
don't forget you banged
the girls' health teacher.

06:37.717 --> 06:39.520
Oh. That was a big one.

06:39.554 --> 06:40.821
They're incredible.

06:40.854 --> 06:42.890
They've had both their arms
ripped off by a gorilla,

06:42.924 --> 06:44.392
and they're still pitching
a perfect game.

06:44.424 --> 06:45.526
I don't know how they did it.

06:45.559 --> 06:47.362
You're probably wondering how we did it.

06:47.395 --> 06:48.563
Well, we sought the help

06:48.595 --> 06:50.497
of a licensed marriage counselor.

06:50.530 --> 06:54.001
And then an <i> unlicensed</i> one
whose office had better parking.

06:56.903 --> 06:58.572
But what we found most helpful...

06:58.605 --> 07:02.175
was how inspired we were
by a very special couple.

07:02.208 --> 07:04.078
Yes. They're best friends.

07:04.111 --> 07:06.914
They're co-captains of the <i> S.S. Romance.</i>

07:06.948 --> 07:11.152
They're partners in the law firm
of Smooch, Hug, and Feingold.

07:11.184 --> 07:12.152
That's right.

07:12.186 --> 07:14.322
We're talking about our son Will.

07:14.354 --> 07:17.025
And his girlfriend, Angie.

07:18.225 --> 07:19.727
To Will and Angie.

07:19.760 --> 07:21.563
Will and Angie!

07:21.595 --> 07:23.564
Wait. What is happening?
Why are they throwing to us?

07:23.597 --> 07:24.932
Do they want us to say
the name of the couple?

07:24.965 --> 07:26.501
The couple <i> is</i> us, Angie.

07:26.534 --> 07:27.569
Terrible twist...

07:27.602 --> 07:29.871
the toast is coming
from inside the house.

07:29.903 --> 07:31.109
Oh.

07:33.298 --> 07:35.935
Hey, guys. A note about your toast...

07:35.967 --> 07:37.282
Yeah, less of a note,
more of just, like,

07:37.307 --> 07:38.520
a "What-chu talkin' 'bout, Willis?"

07:38.552 --> 07:40.004
That's a synonym for note.

07:40.029 --> 07:41.620
Mom, Dad, uh...

07:41.645 --> 07:43.580
- the thing about Angie and I is that we...
- I'm sorry.

07:43.605 --> 07:44.974
Did we embarrass you,

07:45.007 --> 07:47.619
Mr. Big Shot Weatherman
Public Personality?

07:47.644 --> 07:49.113
So, sue us.

07:49.163 --> 07:51.532
We're very proud
that you found true love.

07:51.565 --> 07:54.168
We're parents. We brag. It's what we do.

07:54.200 --> 07:55.969
No, Mom, we're not...

07:56.003 --> 07:58.139
We didn't want to get
bogged down in details

07:58.171 --> 08:01.007
in front of our friends,
but the truth is...

08:01.041 --> 08:03.743
we were <i> this</i> close to a divorce.

08:03.777 --> 08:05.479
- Oh.
- My bags were packed.

08:05.512 --> 08:07.348
Your father grew a soul patch.

08:07.380 --> 08:09.983
I was one click away
from a black leather couch.

08:10.017 --> 08:12.185
Started wearing my wedding ring
on my thumb.

08:12.219 --> 08:15.589
But in our darkest times,
when it just feels

08:15.623 --> 08:18.492
like there is <i> no</i> point
in trying anymore,

08:18.524 --> 08:20.861
that one ray of light

08:20.894 --> 08:24.566
that cuts through the blackness
and it gives us hope.

08:25.632 --> 08:28.168
- Me and Angie?
- Us?

08:28.202 --> 08:30.071
Yes, you're so inspiring,

08:30.103 --> 08:32.438
the way you communicate
and support each other.

08:32.472 --> 08:34.842
Look, we understand it might not
make any sense to you,

08:34.875 --> 08:37.409
- but it makes sense to <i> us.</i>
- Yeah.

08:37.443 --> 08:40.212
So, Will's relationship with <i> me</i>

08:40.246 --> 08:43.284
is what's keeping <i> you...</i>

08:43.317 --> 08:46.386
- from... a divorce?
- Boop.

08:46.419 --> 08:47.854
- Perfectly said.
- Yes.

08:47.888 --> 08:49.123
Will, hang on to this one.

08:49.155 --> 08:50.625
She has a knack for summaries,

08:50.658 --> 08:53.628
and she can figure out the tabs
on your Netscape!

08:53.660 --> 08:57.765
And your sexual chemistry
is the stuff of volcanoes.

09:01.135 --> 09:02.870
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna stop you right there.

09:02.903 --> 09:05.239
While it is true that I, myself,

09:05.271 --> 09:07.707
ooze sexuality all over the place,

09:07.741 --> 09:09.376
uh, Will and I...

09:09.409 --> 09:10.477
Babe?

09:10.510 --> 09:11.745
A mo'?

09:11.779 --> 09:14.148
Oh!

09:14.181 --> 09:16.617
I think that was short for moment.

09:16.649 --> 09:18.385
Ugh, your hand is soaking wet.

09:18.418 --> 09:20.000
Because I'm nervous, okay?

09:20.032 --> 09:21.997
The only thing keeping my
parents' real marriage together

09:22.021 --> 09:23.089
is our fake relationship.

09:23.122 --> 09:24.257
We have to play along.

09:24.290 --> 09:27.260
Okay, dude.
You are a grown man, all right?

09:27.293 --> 09:28.795
You can handle your parents
getting divorced.

09:28.828 --> 09:30.130
The thing you should
really be upset about

09:30.164 --> 09:31.798
is that they are going to die.

09:31.832 --> 09:33.266
Not today, but soon.

09:33.299 --> 09:35.969
Come on, all we have to do is
convince a bunch of old people

09:36.002 --> 09:37.671
that we're in love for like two hours,

09:37.711 --> 09:40.044
just until the sun sets, and they
return home to watch "Jeopardy!"

09:40.069 --> 09:42.009
- It'll be easy.
- That's what <i> you</i> think.

09:42.042 --> 09:44.245
No one's gonna buy
that you scored this hot piece.

09:44.278 --> 09:46.647
What?! I'm on TV. I'm a local celebrity.

09:46.679 --> 09:47.814
Women look at me

09:47.847 --> 09:49.649
and they salivate
like I'm a rotisserie chicken.

09:49.683 --> 09:52.352
The fan mail I get, Angie... insane.

09:52.385 --> 09:54.988
Most of it's from prison, but the things
they say they want to do to me...

09:55.021 --> 09:56.456
You're not writing them back, are you?

09:56.490 --> 09:57.825
It would be rude if I didn't,
but I <i> am</i> worried

09:57.857 --> 09:59.800
I'm getting in too deep
and can't get out of it.

09:59.824 --> 10:01.626
Anyway, please just pretend
to be my girlfriend.

10:01.627 --> 10:03.963
Don't you think
that this is all a bit much?

10:03.996 --> 10:05.466
I don't like it either, okay?

10:05.499 --> 10:07.368
But I can't let my mom and dad
get divorced.

10:07.400 --> 10:09.135
Divorce is what happens to <i> other</i> people

10:09.168 --> 10:11.471
and to me personally,
but not to my parents.

10:11.505 --> 10:15.609
Ohh! Bud and Lucy spoke about
the two of you so beautifully.

10:15.641 --> 10:18.178
- Oh!
- So, tell us, what's your secret?

10:19.346 --> 10:20.648
Um...

10:25.052 --> 10:27.388
- Honey.
- Mm-hmm?

10:27.420 --> 10:28.455
I'll take this one.

10:28.489 --> 10:29.657
Okay.

10:29.689 --> 10:31.124
When I come home from work,

10:31.158 --> 10:33.627
there are three things
he has waiting for me.

10:33.659 --> 10:35.195
Number one, a hot meal,

10:35.228 --> 10:36.896
number two, an ice-cold martini...

10:36.929 --> 10:39.331
...and number three,
foot rub so intense,

10:39.356 --> 10:40.362
Mama sees angels.

10:40.387 --> 10:42.902
A-A-Also, we like beaches.

10:42.936 --> 10:44.638
The movie <i> and</i> the place.

10:46.173 --> 10:47.475
How you feeling?

10:47.508 --> 10:49.210
I'm gonna find that goat

10:49.242 --> 10:51.345
and make it drink a wine made out of <i> me.</i>

10:52.578 --> 10:54.414
Well, I finished boxing up
the goat wine.

10:54.447 --> 10:56.149
So, guess I should go get Rory.

10:56.183 --> 10:59.653
He probably has Douglas
in some kind of outfit by now.

10:59.686 --> 11:01.555
O-Or, since he offered to help,

11:01.587 --> 11:03.890
you ask Douglas to keep watching Rory.

11:03.923 --> 11:04.991
You deserve a break.

11:05.024 --> 11:07.227
To do what? Sit around and enjoy myself?

11:07.260 --> 11:08.228
Who am I? Angie?

11:08.261 --> 11:10.330
Come on! Let Douglas help you.

11:10.364 --> 11:11.565
You don't want another Davey.

11:11.597 --> 11:13.000
Ooh! Davey!

11:13.033 --> 11:14.502
- He was useless.
- Useless.

11:14.534 --> 11:15.836
- But boy, was he tall.
- Tall.

11:15.869 --> 11:17.838
I once saw him eat a leaf off a tree

11:17.870 --> 11:19.273
like a brontosaurus.

11:19.306 --> 11:20.708
Hunh.

11:20.741 --> 11:22.109
But you're right. I should do this.

11:22.141 --> 11:23.376
- How should I do it?
- Okay.

11:23.409 --> 11:24.844
So, you text Douglas

11:24.877 --> 11:27.347
and ask him to keep Rory
for the rest of the afternoon

11:27.380 --> 11:29.616
while you go shopping... for <i> you!</i>

11:29.649 --> 11:31.751
And maybe for <i> me,</i> if you feel
so inclined.

11:31.784 --> 11:32.752
- I don't.
- Okay.

11:32.785 --> 11:33.853
But okay.

11:33.886 --> 11:35.755
Um... you know what?

11:35.789 --> 11:38.391
Just gonna text him "I'm tied up."

11:38.424 --> 11:39.526
Right? I mean, why start a thing?

11:39.559 --> 11:40.627
Yeah, close enough.

11:40.660 --> 11:41.761
All right. Let's hit the mall.

11:41.794 --> 11:43.963
I want to see teens and old people

11:43.996 --> 11:46.399
comfortably co-exist.

11:46.433 --> 11:48.068
How did we meet? Uh...

11:48.101 --> 11:51.371
Well, buckle up, because it is a yarn.

11:51.404 --> 11:52.439
Remember, darling?

11:52.472 --> 11:54.407
Uh, like it was yesterday, buttercup.

11:54.441 --> 11:56.877
Uh, we met on a...

11:56.909 --> 11:58.145
- ski trip...
- Hot August night.

11:59.145 --> 12:02.116
Because we both love water skiing...

12:02.149 --> 12:03.250
in the dark.

12:03.283 --> 12:04.752
- It's actually safer.
- Yeah.

12:04.784 --> 12:06.986
Here we go.

12:07.019 --> 12:08.588
Watch me. They have to match.

12:08.621 --> 12:10.089
Believe me, I know symmetry.

12:10.122 --> 12:12.725
Tony! Hold still!

12:12.759 --> 12:15.629
So, next thing we know, this knucklehead

12:15.662 --> 12:18.232
has signed us up
for the pair skiing competition

12:18.265 --> 12:20.800
at the Lake Winnipesaukee Olympics!

12:20.833 --> 12:22.435
- And we win!
- Wha!

12:22.468 --> 12:23.603
What did you win?

12:23.636 --> 12:25.472
- $50,000!
- Fish dinner.

12:26.673 --> 12:28.976
It's an easy mistake
because, you know what?

12:29.009 --> 12:31.946
To look into this man's eyes
while he is eating...

12:31.978 --> 12:35.333
makes you feel
like you have won $50,000.

12:35.358 --> 12:37.650
I do eat fish very sexually.

12:37.683 --> 12:39.986
Watch me, Tony!

12:41.487 --> 12:43.357
You missed a spot!

12:43.382 --> 12:44.752
So, now we're back at our cabin,

12:44.785 --> 12:46.153
first place trophy on the mantel,

12:46.185 --> 12:47.669
our bellies full of catfish...

12:47.701 --> 12:48.896
Our hearts full of love.

12:48.921 --> 12:50.324
And at the exact same time,

12:50.357 --> 12:51.858
we look at one another and we say...

12:51.892 --> 12:52.993
"I love you.

12:53.026 --> 12:54.527
Would you like to go out
on a second date?"

13:02.268 --> 13:03.436
And then what happened?

13:03.469 --> 13:05.071
You know what, Betty? Calm down.

13:05.104 --> 13:06.239
C'mon, you big chimney.

13:06.272 --> 13:07.707
Now that we have my shoes,

13:07.741 --> 13:10.010
only six more stops until dance class.

13:10.042 --> 13:11.110
Could we take a break?

13:11.143 --> 13:12.579
I've done everything you wanted
and more.

13:12.613 --> 13:13.914
I even pulled over coming here

13:13.946 --> 13:16.382
because you thought you saw
Jennifer Lawrence at a Rite Aid.

13:16.416 --> 13:20.054
Okay, it was Jennifer <i> Lopez,</i>
and it also... wasn't her.

13:20.086 --> 13:21.421
That was my B.

13:21.454 --> 13:24.224
Now let's go to a deli.
I haven't eaten in 45 minutes.

13:24.257 --> 13:25.358
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.

13:25.392 --> 13:27.527
You ate 45 minutes ago?
I haven't eaten all day.

13:27.560 --> 13:28.929
Let's sit, huh?

13:28.961 --> 13:30.697
My mom hasn't sat in 10 years.

13:30.730 --> 13:32.365
Do you know how hard that woman works?

13:32.398 --> 13:34.701
Whoo! We're wearing
everything we bought!

13:34.734 --> 13:36.135
Two for leisure, please.

13:40.272 --> 13:42.041
It's not what you think.

13:42.075 --> 13:44.411
Lady, you forgot your alto saxophone.

13:44.444 --> 13:45.613
Ssst!

13:47.079 --> 13:48.214
Here he is!

13:48.248 --> 13:50.883
Men want to be him,
women want to hug him.

13:50.916 --> 13:52.853
Tony!

13:58.791 --> 13:59.892
All that's left to do

13:59.926 --> 14:02.530
is to get this show pony to the rodeo.

14:03.796 --> 14:05.199
Now somebody wake him up.

14:08.368 --> 14:10.337
See? Look how happy they are.

14:10.369 --> 14:11.772
If only there was some music playing,

14:11.805 --> 14:13.007
they wouldn't seem so crazy.

14:14.675 --> 14:18.178
Hey, uh, thank you for...
being my pretend girlfriend.

14:18.210 --> 14:19.812
Oh. Pfft. No problem.

14:19.845 --> 14:21.548
It was actually...

14:23.215 --> 14:24.317
Easy.

14:25.484 --> 14:26.653
Yeah.

14:28.689 --> 14:31.858
I'm gonna go double-napkin
some cake to take home.

14:31.892 --> 14:33.994
Delicious.

14:36.363 --> 14:38.498
Son, you really dressed this party up,

14:38.531 --> 14:40.834
but Angie strutted it down the runway.

14:40.867 --> 14:42.469
Oh, yeah. That's my lady.

14:42.502 --> 14:44.371
The ol' ball and chain. My one and only.

14:44.403 --> 14:45.538
Ohh!

14:45.571 --> 14:47.206
I am <i> so</i> sorry I'm late.

14:47.239 --> 14:49.176
I had to shower twice just to get off

14:49.209 --> 14:50.611
- all the sake and fur.
- H...

14:50.643 --> 14:51.678
- Oh, hi.
- Hi!

14:51.711 --> 14:53.112
Mmm!

14:56.349 --> 14:59.853
♪ Angie's walkin' backwards ♪

14:59.886 --> 15:02.477
♪ Tryin' to leave the room ♪

15:02.626 --> 15:05.766
Ah. Okay, so, that's just
a kiss that we do

15:05.821 --> 15:07.047
that everybody's cool with.

15:07.079 --> 15:08.930
Uh, Angie, do you want
to take Tracy into the kitchen,

15:09.026 --> 15:10.561
show her that kangaroo-shaped
soap dispenser

15:10.594 --> 15:11.996
where the soap comes out of the mouth

15:12.028 --> 15:13.364
but you put the sponge in
the pouch, like a little joey?

15:13.397 --> 15:14.398
Thank you.

15:14.431 --> 15:16.667
I am going to take these parents of mine

15:16.700 --> 15:19.070
into a room that is not this one.

15:19.103 --> 15:20.537
Guys.

15:20.571 --> 15:23.225
Let's throw another soap on the spongy.

15:23.250 --> 15:26.210
- What are you...
- Just come see it.

15:26.243 --> 15:28.412
Kissing another woman?

15:28.445 --> 15:30.748
In your own home?
It's brazen. It's brazen!

15:30.781 --> 15:32.016
He got this from you.

15:32.048 --> 15:33.350
Those might as well be <i> your</i> lips.

15:33.383 --> 15:36.052
Ah. You got <i> my</i> ass,
but you got <i> his</i> lips!

15:36.085 --> 15:37.187
Damn it, Lucy,

15:37.220 --> 15:39.056
I take responsibility for my own mouth,

15:39.089 --> 15:40.191
no one else's!

15:40.224 --> 15:42.259
Okay, guys, I have
a lot of info to get out,

15:42.292 --> 15:44.294
so I need you to put on
your young-people brains, okay?

15:44.327 --> 15:45.730
Yes, you saw me kissing a woman.

15:45.763 --> 15:48.232
That woman, known as Tracy,
is my actual girlfriend.

15:48.264 --> 15:49.566
- What?
- Angie is <i> not</i> my girlfriend,

15:49.600 --> 15:51.234
but when you thought she was,
we went along with it

15:51.268 --> 15:53.370
because you said our relationship
was saving your marriage.

15:53.403 --> 15:55.750
And it's true... my <i> friendship</i>
with Angie is very inspiring,

15:55.775 --> 15:57.211
but I have a great thing
going with Tracy,

15:57.236 --> 15:58.868
and not to build it up
too much... hopefully,

15:58.893 --> 16:00.577
<i>that</i> will be the relationship
that keeps you guys together.

16:00.610 --> 16:02.046
Any questions?

16:02.779 --> 16:04.081
Mom, there's three people in this room.

16:04.114 --> 16:05.449
You don't have to raise your hand.

16:05.481 --> 16:06.916
- Do you always lie to us?
- How long have you known Tracy?

16:06.950 --> 16:08.219
- Was your marriage to Mia real?
- Are you intimate?

16:08.252 --> 16:09.553
- And is Sophie still Sophie?
- Where's her family from?

16:09.585 --> 16:11.321
O-Okay, obviously,
we <i> do</i> need to raise hands,

16:11.355 --> 16:13.057
and, Mom, I saw yours first.

16:13.090 --> 16:15.725
Actually, mine <i> was</i> raised,
but it was low, so... okay.

16:15.758 --> 16:17.561
Is this the Tracy from work?

16:17.594 --> 16:18.896
Yes. She's my boss.

16:18.928 --> 16:21.731
Follow-up question...
do we think that's a good idea?

16:21.764 --> 16:23.167
So, it's two questions per hand raise?

16:23.200 --> 16:24.302
It's good to know.

16:24.335 --> 16:25.469
Everyone will get their turn.

16:25.502 --> 16:27.071
Yes, Tracy is my boss,

16:27.104 --> 16:28.571
but we are navigating the tricky waters

16:28.605 --> 16:30.106
of a modern office romance very well,

16:30.139 --> 16:32.042
and she means a lot to me.

16:33.143 --> 16:34.244
Yes, Father?

16:34.278 --> 16:35.613
Well, what were we supposed to think?

16:35.646 --> 16:37.181
We've never even met Tracy,

16:37.214 --> 16:39.110
and we've been to where
Angie went to elementary school.

16:39.135 --> 16:40.063
We didn't want to go,

16:40.087 --> 16:41.194
- but she took us there anyway.
- Not at all.

16:41.219 --> 16:43.486
Look, Angie is a good fr...

16:43.519 --> 16:44.922
a <i> great</i> friend.

16:44.955 --> 16:47.858
Honestly, she's... my <i> best</i> friend.

16:47.890 --> 16:50.193
Caught between two women.

16:50.226 --> 16:52.062
Sounds familiar.

16:53.497 --> 16:55.633
I was referencing my own affair.

16:55.666 --> 16:56.801
You're not that deep.

16:56.834 --> 16:58.502
Yeah, Dad, we were able
to crack the code.

17:01.071 --> 17:02.039
Yes, Mother?

17:02.071 --> 17:04.140
Is Tracy Presbyterian?

17:04.174 --> 17:05.676
Are <i> we</i> Presbyterian?

17:07.477 --> 17:08.978
See, you push on the head,

17:09.012 --> 17:11.214
and it barfs out the soap, which <i> I</i> love.

17:11.247 --> 17:13.849
Angie... what are you doing?

17:15.351 --> 17:17.119
See, you push on the head,

17:17.154 --> 17:19.290
and it barfs out the soap, which <i> I</i> love.

17:19.321 --> 17:20.957
Okay, Angie.

17:20.991 --> 17:23.560
Look...

17:23.593 --> 17:26.563
It's weird that I'm here.

17:26.597 --> 17:30.901
And not just today,
but... all the times.

17:30.934 --> 17:32.869
And that can't be fun for you.

17:32.902 --> 17:34.971
You're right. It's...

17:35.004 --> 17:36.741
it's not.

17:40.010 --> 17:41.311
See, you push on the head,

17:41.344 --> 17:43.480
and it barfs out the soap, which <i> I</i> love.

17:43.513 --> 17:45.750
Sorry. I'm re-reading your text.

17:45.783 --> 17:47.984
"Still up to my ears in goat wine.

17:48.017 --> 17:50.687
Miggy continues to complain
of rumb-rumbs.

17:50.721 --> 17:52.690
No end in sight."

17:52.723 --> 17:53.858
Yeah. Yeah.

17:53.890 --> 17:55.058
And get this...

17:55.091 --> 17:56.927
the only store
that sells rumb-rumb medicine

17:56.959 --> 17:59.629
keeps woodwinds by the register
for impulse buys.

18:00.930 --> 18:02.533
All right. I'm sorry.

18:02.565 --> 18:04.534
I just... I wanted
to take an afternoon off,

18:04.568 --> 18:06.337
and I couldn't bring myself to ask you.

18:06.369 --> 18:07.737
Look, Poppy, you shouldn't be afraid

18:07.771 --> 18:11.008
to ask me to do anything,
especially if it involves Rory.

18:12.909 --> 18:15.379
Douglas, can you please take Rory

18:15.411 --> 18:17.213
for the rest of the day

18:17.246 --> 18:19.917
so that I can have the afternoon off?

18:19.949 --> 18:21.184
Just for me?

18:21.217 --> 18:22.919
It would be my pleasure.

18:22.953 --> 18:25.122
Click-clack, click-clack,
click-clickity-clack,

18:25.155 --> 18:26.891
clack-clack-, clack-clack,
click-clickity-clack,

18:26.924 --> 18:29.707
clackity-clack, clackity-clack,
clack-clack-clack-clack.

18:29.739 --> 18:32.675
Son of a bitch
isn't even wearing the shoes.

18:35.511 --> 18:36.945
Angie.

18:36.979 --> 18:38.514
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:38.547 --> 18:41.050
I'm leaving, but are you okay?

18:41.082 --> 18:42.484
Not really.

18:42.518 --> 18:45.655
Pretty sure my parents' marriage
is screwed.

18:46.688 --> 18:48.156
It's a lot to process.

18:48.189 --> 18:49.991
Do you think that
maybe I could call you later

18:50.024 --> 18:51.660
- and we could...
- Will, I love hanging out with you,

18:51.694 --> 18:53.229
but we need to do less of it.

18:53.262 --> 18:55.031
For Tracy's sake and...

18:56.999 --> 18:58.735
...for everything.

18:59.835 --> 19:01.337
Okay. Yeah.

19:01.369 --> 19:03.939
No, you're... you're probably right.

19:04.906 --> 19:06.641
So, are <i> we</i> getting divorced, or...

19:06.675 --> 19:07.976
Is this like a best-friend divorce?

19:08.010 --> 19:10.012
Oh, no, that would...
that'd crush Betty.

19:10.044 --> 19:11.380
Yeah. Yeah.

19:11.414 --> 19:14.050
No, let's just call it
a best-friend trial separation.

19:14.082 --> 19:15.752
Okay.

19:15.784 --> 19:17.486
But I gotta live my life.

19:17.520 --> 19:19.155
I'm gonna be best friends
with other people.

19:19.187 --> 19:21.323
Hey, we're separated.

19:21.357 --> 19:22.724
None of my business.

19:24.000 --> 19:30.074

19:33.135 --> 19:35.171
We'll always have Lake Winnipesaukee.

19:35.204 --> 19:37.205
Ah. First place.

19:45.481 --> 19:47.383
Oh. Cool. You guys have met.

19:47.416 --> 19:48.618
No, we missed our window,

19:48.650 --> 19:51.019
and now we're stuck
in uncomfortable silence.

19:51.052 --> 19:53.955
Okay. Even better,
because I want to do the honors.

19:53.989 --> 19:55.591
Mom, Dad,

19:55.624 --> 19:58.227
<i>this</i> is my girlfriend, Tracy Freeze.

19:58.260 --> 19:59.929
Hi.

19:59.962 --> 20:01.531
Lovely to meet you.

20:01.563 --> 20:03.398
Uh... now, correct me if I'm wrong,

20:03.432 --> 20:06.102
but is "Freeze" Methodist?

20:06.135 --> 20:09.105
I don't know if a name
can be Methodist...

20:09.137 --> 20:11.240
...but my family's Presbyterian.

20:11.272 --> 20:13.408
I knew it.

20:15.845 --> 20:17.506
We're Episcopalian.

20:18.960 --> 20:22.686
Okay. We've done everything
we can. It's up to him now.

20:22.741 --> 20:24.076
Come on, Tony.

20:24.101 --> 20:27.204
Spread those cheeks and...
let the smile do the talking.

20:27.237 --> 20:30.373
Yeah. Take a lap. Check out the talent.

20:30.407 --> 20:31.976
Good.

20:32.008 --> 20:33.544
Good.

20:33.576 --> 20:35.011
Yeah.

20:35.045 --> 20:37.581
Now perch and let the birds flock.

20:41.852 --> 20:43.521
Here you go.

20:47.724 --> 20:48.893
Oh, my gosh!

20:48.926 --> 20:51.929
Guys, look at my arm.

20:51.961 --> 20:53.064
I'm shaking.

20:54.931 --> 20:56.766
Goodbye, Cassandra.

20:56.799 --> 21:00.003
He's found a new woman,
and he's gonna hug her forever.

21:00.036 --> 21:01.572
Just think of the wedding.

21:01.604 --> 21:03.873
Something small and intimate.

21:03.907 --> 21:05.876
By the sea.

21:09.412 --> 21:11.047
What have we done?

21:11.081 --> 21:12.349
Oh, my God.

21:12.381 --> 21:14.718
We've created a hug ho!

21:16.285 --> 21:17.720
Guys, Tony's asleep.

21:17.754 --> 21:20.945
Tony!
