00:03.339 --> 00:04.639
<i>So, we take orders</i>
<i>from you</i> now?

00:04.705 --> 00:08.241
Think of me as Gabriel,
but...prettier.

00:08.536 --> 00:12.140
Coming to you live from the home
of the Secretary of Defense.

00:12.208 --> 00:14.109
<i>The prime minister</i>
<i>fully supports your efforts</i>

00:14.176 --> 00:16.444
<i>to build a ballistic missile shield,</i>

00:16.512 --> 00:20.181
<i>provided it covers Europe,</i>
<i>as well as the United States.</i>

00:20.249 --> 00:22.350
We're just starting out here.
You're starting out.

00:22.418 --> 00:23.785
The day you forced me to work for you,

00:23.852 --> 00:25.186
my life got very scary.

00:25.254 --> 00:27.655
I was 17 when I joined the KGB.

00:27.723 --> 00:30.358
When we got here, I was 22 years old,

00:30.426 --> 00:33.929
living in a strange house
in a strange country

00:33.996 --> 00:35.463
with a strange man.

00:35.531 --> 00:37.598
It never really happened for us,

00:37.666 --> 00:40.068
but I feel like it's happening now.

00:40.136 --> 00:43.271
<i>Tensions escalated</i>
<i>on the Polish border</i>

00:43.339 --> 00:46.674
<i>as Soviet troops continued</i>
<i>their show of force</i>

00:46.742 --> 00:48.509
<i>in response to growing unrest</i>

00:48.577 --> 00:51.512
<i>inspired by the solidarity</i>
<i>trade union movement.</i>

00:51.580 --> 00:54.615
<i>Government sources called</i>
<i>the Russian military exercises</i>

00:54.683 --> 00:56.717
<i>troubling and destabilizing.</i>
<i>Where's Poland?</i>

00:56.785 --> 00:58.386
It's part of Russia.

00:58.454 --> 00:59.821
Oh.

00:59.888 --> 01:01.889
Is that what Mr. Henrickson
is teaching you?

01:01.958 --> 01:04.525
Uh, yeah.
Same neighborhood.

01:04.593 --> 01:06.962
You guys, we have to go.
Come on.

01:07.029 --> 01:09.297
You need to eat something.
I'm not hungry.

01:09.365 --> 01:11.232
Here.
Take this with you.

01:11.300 --> 01:13.634
Come on, Henry.
Okay.

01:13.702 --> 01:16.637
Um...are we still on,
or...?

01:16.705 --> 01:18.840
Yeah, of course.
Okay.

01:18.907 --> 01:20.075
Uh, on for what?

01:20.142 --> 01:21.977
None of your business.
Let's go.

01:22.044 --> 01:24.179
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
Henry, lunch.

01:24.246 --> 01:27.148
Oh, yeah.
Thank you.

01:27.216 --> 01:30.651
- <i>...both Poland and potentially 
the entire eastern bloc.</i> - <i>No, you</i> do.

01:30.719 --> 01:33.855
So, gentlemen, customs just stopped

01:33.922 --> 01:36.757
the son of the Romanian
Deputy Chief of Mission

01:36.825 --> 01:40.395
on his way back to Bucharest
with three pounds of marijuana.

01:40.463 --> 01:41.829
Three pounds?

01:41.897 --> 01:43.417
Well, he either really likes the stuff,

01:43.432 --> 01:45.733
or that's a commie
with a little business instinct.

01:45.801 --> 01:47.735
They're swinging him by here
before they do their paperwork.

01:47.803 --> 01:50.705
Do you know what they do
with drug dealers in Romania?

01:50.772 --> 01:52.573
Why don't you guys take a run at him,

01:52.641 --> 01:54.342
see if he wants to keep his balls.

For making us take the afternoon off.

03:58.855 --> 04:00.856
Hmm.

04:06.896 --> 04:08.831
That's what you want to thank me for?

04:08.898 --> 04:09.832
Mm-hmm.

04:23.313 --> 04:25.581
and what they've been doing
for the past 24 hours.

04:25.649 --> 04:27.583
Peters.
On it.

04:27.651 --> 04:28.751
Get everything you can from
secret service about the shooter.

04:28.818 --> 04:30.019
I need to know if he has

04:30.086 --> 04:31.521
any Soviet connection whatsoever.

04:31.588 --> 04:33.523
This guy said "Nyet" once
in the past 10 years,

04:33.590 --> 04:34.857
we're gonna find out when and where.

04:34.924 --> 04:37.460
Yes, sir.
Team on the embassy, sir?

04:37.528 --> 04:38.861
Yeah, but not you.

04:38.928 --> 04:40.630
<i>The bullet is believed to,</i>

04:40.697 --> 04:42.831
<i>- uh, be a .22-caliber bullet.</i>

04:42.899 --> 04:46.035
I'm just hearing.
<i>Possibly as many as six shots...</i>

04:46.102 --> 04:48.371
<i>- from the .22-caliber weapon were fired...</i>
<i>- It's awful.</i>

04:48.438 --> 04:50.673
<i>...we're told by law-enforcement officers...</i>

04:50.740 --> 04:52.775
<i>...just outside</i>
<i>the Washington Hilton Hotel,</i>

04:58.582 --> 05:02.151
<i>Constitutionally, gentlemen,

<i>the vice president,</i>
<i>and the secretary of state,</i>

05:05.055 --> 05:07.990

05:11.228 --> 05:12.895

<i>- What is --</i>

05:12.962 --> 05:17.733
<i>As of now, I am in control here</i>

05:17.801 --> 05:19.368

05:21.071 --> 05:23.005
<i>If something came up,</i>
<i>I would check with him.</i>

05:23.073 --> 05:24.139
What's happening?

05:24.208 --> 05:26.175
The president's been shot.

05:26.243 --> 05:27.976
Oh, my God.
Is he okay?

05:28.044 --> 05:30.379
Nobody knows.
News says he's in surgery.

05:30.447 --> 05:35.384
<i>James Brady, the 40-year-old
White House Press Secretary...</i>

05:35.452 --> 05:38.221
I'll find Charles.
I'll check the signal site

05:38.288 --> 05:40.055
and go home and check the shortwave.

05:40.123 --> 05:42.425
I'll see you at home.

05:46.129 --> 05:47.530
Where are you on the shooter?

05:47.598 --> 05:48.997
Eighth floor is in the process

05:49.065 --> 05:50.766
of putting together a bio and profile.

05:50.834 --> 05:53.001
Is he a KGB operative?

05:53.069 --> 05:54.837
The eighth floor will
soon let us all know

05:54.904 --> 05:57.206
that Hinckley worked
at 31 flavors when he was 16.

05:57.274 --> 05:58.608
Please, look for connections

05:58.675 --> 06:03.412
to the Soviet Union
and the Communist Party.

06:09.353 --> 06:13.522
I want you to set up a meet
A.S.A.P. with your friend.

06:13.590 --> 06:15.691
The Rezidentura are gonna be
all over their people.

06:15.759 --> 06:17.126
I'm aware of the risks.

06:17.193 --> 06:18.761
But our number-one priority
is finding out

06:18.828 --> 06:21.029
what the KGB knows about this.

06:21.097 --> 06:22.632
All right, I'll leave a signal

06:22.699 --> 06:24.300
for her to meet in the next 24 hours.

06:24.368 --> 06:27.136
Agent Beeman, we're operating
on a tight time frame.

06:27.203 --> 06:29.238
24 hours is like two weeks.

06:29.306 --> 06:30.773
I understand that, sir,

06:30.840 --> 06:33.142
but she's living her life
in a tight time frame, too.

06:33.209 --> 06:35.311
It gets even shorter
if we're not careful.

06:35.379 --> 06:36.646
I get it that you don't want to

06:36.713 --> 06:38.381
send her to the slaughterhouse.

06:38.448 --> 06:41.917
But if the president has been
shot by a KGB operative,

06:41.985 --> 06:44.219
I want to know
before nuclear missiles start

06:44.288 --> 06:45.655
whistling over my head.

06:45.722 --> 06:48.223
You get to your girl.
You get to her now.

06:51.227 --> 06:55.164
Do you think what's on the news is true?

06:55.231 --> 06:58.167
Sam Donaldson was there when the
gun was fired. I believe him.

06:58.234 --> 07:02.805
But since they closed the doors
at George Washington,

07:02.872 --> 07:04.907
no actual information's getting out.

07:04.974 --> 07:08.143
It's all completely sanitized
by the White House press office.

07:08.211 --> 07:10.313
Can you get the real story?

07:10.380 --> 07:12.748
Not today.

07:12.816 --> 07:16.285
Look, Reagan's cronies love me.

07:16.353 --> 07:17.687
There's nothing better

07:17.754 --> 07:19.288
than a former socialist
turned conservative

07:19.356 --> 07:22.925
raising the hue and cry
about the evils of communism,

07:22.992 --> 07:25.160
but I am still a member of the press.

07:25.228 --> 07:28.631
Today, I have no access at all.

07:28.699 --> 07:31.634
What about the names
of the nursing staff --

07:31.702 --> 07:34.002
those who were around the president?

07:34.070 --> 07:35.438
Can you get me those?

07:35.505 --> 07:36.839
That I could do.

07:36.906 --> 07:38.374
Say I was writing a piece,

07:38.442 --> 07:40.202
but those people aren't
going to talk to you.

07:40.243 --> 07:42.445
Just get me the names.

07:44.414 --> 07:48.016
Frankly, I hope

07:48.084 --> 07:51.019
the bastard bleeds to death
on the operating table.

07:51.087 --> 07:58.227
Your commitment to the struggle
always was...total.

07:58.294 --> 08:01.497
<i>White House press
secretary James Brady is dead.</i>

08:01.565 --> 08:04.500
<i>Jim Brady, 40 years old,</i>
<i>shot in the head in the attack</i>

08:04.568 --> 08:07.002
<i>by what apparently was</i>
<i>one of the first bullets fired.</i>

08:07.070 --> 08:10.205
<i>Having looked at videotape</i>
<i>so many times already,</i>

08:10.273 --> 08:11.306
<i>that is the report.</i>

08:11.375 --> 08:13.308
<i>And from congressional sources,</i>

08:13.377 --> 08:17.045
<i>James Brady has not survived his wounds.</i>

08:26.956 --> 08:29.525
No time for signals today, I'm afraid.

08:29.593 --> 08:32.895
Philip's with Sparrow right now.
Good.

08:32.962 --> 08:35.631
You need to gather your supplies
for operation Christopher.

08:37.601 --> 08:39.668
I've heard so much about you,
Elizabeth --

08:39.736 --> 08:41.003
what you've done.

08:41.070 --> 08:44.607
I think we'll do great things together.

08:44.674 --> 08:46.942
I really wish we didn't
have to start this way.

08:47.010 --> 08:50.746
I never asked. What are
we supposed to call you?

08:50.814 --> 08:52.381
Claudia.

08:52.449 --> 08:53.883
Claudia.

08:53.950 --> 08:56.786
Did <i>we</i> do this?
I don't think so,

08:56.853 --> 08:58.287
but they may try to pin it on us.

08:58.354 --> 08:59.955
And we have no idea

09:00.023 --> 09:01.957
who's going to seize control
of the American government now.

09:02.025 --> 09:04.192
I've also heard rumors
the red army might move

09:04.260 --> 09:06.395
into Poland in the next 24 hours.

09:06.463 --> 09:08.798
But Operation Christopher?

09:08.865 --> 09:11.266
You think this is headed
toward guerrilla warfare?

09:11.334 --> 09:13.268
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

09:13.336 --> 09:14.703
First, we need you to find out

09:14.771 --> 09:16.371
how the president is really doing.

09:16.440 --> 09:18.574
We need to know who's in control
of the American government.

09:18.642 --> 09:20.810
And we need
up-to-date intelligence

09:20.877 --> 09:24.212
on any efforts to blame us
for the assassination attempt.

09:24.280 --> 09:26.214
Things are gonna happen fast.

09:26.282 --> 09:30.619
The Rezidentura will be
worthless, slow, unreliable.

09:30.687 --> 09:33.121
We both know it.
I can say it.

09:33.189 --> 09:36.124
We'll get as much information as we can,

09:36.192 --> 09:38.761
start preparations
for Christopher immediately.

09:38.829 --> 09:41.396
I know I can count on you.

09:41.465 --> 09:47.235
I fought behind enemy lines
in Stalingrad -- two years.

09:47.303 --> 09:48.971
I didn't have any experience,
training --

09:49.038 --> 09:51.607
none of what you have.

09:51.675 --> 09:56.011
If it happens...

09:56.079 --> 09:57.813
you'll do well.

10:20.236 --> 10:24.006
<i>The rumors about --</i>

This is not a good day.

10:37.621 --> 10:39.788

problems we're dealing with here.

10:39.856 --> 10:43.392

14:41.809 --> 14:46.647
♪ should have got it right tonight ♪

14:54.055 --> 14:55.989
I got names.
Did orders come in?

14:56.057 --> 14:57.591
Yeah, but not on the radio.

14:57.659 --> 14:59.826
In person.
What's going on?

15:03.765 --> 15:06.900
They want us ready
for Operation Christopher.

15:06.968 --> 15:08.068
This could be a coup.

15:08.135 --> 15:10.037
Is that what they think?

15:10.104 --> 15:11.672
You saw Haig on TV.

15:11.739 --> 15:14.675
Where are the kids?

15:14.742 --> 15:16.910
Beemans. Watching TV.
Sandra's there.

15:18.279 --> 15:20.513
We're gonna need a government car.

15:20.582 --> 15:22.983
I'll signal Gregory.

15:34.528 --> 15:36.296
<i>Looking</i>
<i>at the footage again...</i>

15:36.363 --> 15:39.733
They keep showing
the same thing over and over.

15:39.801 --> 15:41.935
What are they supposed to show?

15:42.003 --> 15:43.870
I don't know.

15:43.938 --> 15:45.072
But there's just something ghoulish

15:45.139 --> 15:47.074
about constantly showing this.

15:47.141 --> 15:48.475
Ghoulish?

15:48.542 --> 15:50.711
I mean, it's not gonna change

15:50.778 --> 15:54.114
just because they showed it
over and over and over.

15:54.181 --> 15:55.381
Oh, my God!

15:55.449 --> 15:57.918
Finally, the bullet missed!

15:57.986 --> 16:01.554
The president could die, you know.

16:01.623 --> 16:04.725
I mean, any one of those guys
that got shot could die.

16:04.792 --> 16:07.393
Isn't that pretty ghoulish?

16:18.072 --> 16:21.241
How are you doing?

16:21.308 --> 16:22.442
When do you need it back?

16:22.510 --> 16:25.278
Two hours. Tops.

16:25.346 --> 16:29.683
Hey, listen. Don't bring it back
dinged, all right?

16:36.557 --> 16:38.491
<i>We continue</i>
<i>to receive contradictory</i>

16:38.559 --> 16:41.494
<i>and confusing reports</i>
<i>about the gunman himself.</i>

16:41.562 --> 16:44.330
<i>We know he was subdued at the scene.</i>

17:27.742 --> 17:30.077
David.

17:36.250 --> 17:38.985
That's her.

17:55.469 --> 17:57.237
Dana Simon?

17:57.304 --> 18:00.073
I'm Justin Nezer.
This is Kelly Mainstill.

18:00.141 --> 18:03.009
We're deputy chiefs of staff
for the vice president's office.

18:03.077 --> 18:04.611
We need to talk to you.

18:04.678 --> 18:08.381
Oh. Okay.

18:08.449 --> 18:10.016
First of all,

18:10.084 --> 18:12.018
the vice president would like
to personally thank you

18:12.086 --> 18:14.020
for everything you did today.

18:14.088 --> 18:16.123
I was just...
doing my job.

18:16.190 --> 18:19.392
Dana, can we talk confidentially?

18:19.460 --> 18:22.395
Yes. Of course.

18:22.463 --> 18:24.798
We've had our share of political crises,

18:24.866 --> 18:26.867
but this one's about as political

18:26.934 --> 18:28.101
as a crisis can get.

18:28.169 --> 18:29.770
On a day like today, there can be

18:29.837 --> 18:31.905
a lot of miscommunication
and misinformation,

18:31.973 --> 18:34.440
and it's our job
to make absolutely certain

18:34.508 --> 18:37.443
that the vice president knows
what's going on.

18:37.511 --> 18:39.780
We're quietly checking
with everybody to make sure

18:39.847 --> 18:42.115
what we're hearing
about the president's condition

18:42.183 --> 18:43.116
is true.

18:43.184 --> 18:46.319
Yes. Yes.

18:46.387 --> 18:48.755
He's okay.
He's gonna pull through.

18:48.823 --> 18:51.925
Good. Good. We're very
relieved to hear that.

18:51.993 --> 18:53.493
We're really hoping
that we can count on you

18:53.560 --> 18:54.995
to keep this meeting confidential.

18:55.062 --> 18:56.963
Today's events don't
need to be politicized

18:57.031 --> 18:58.471
any more than they already have been.

18:58.499 --> 19:01.401
I understand.
Absolutely.

19:01.468 --> 19:04.604
You can reach us here 24 hours a day.

19:04.672 --> 19:06.739
They'll get a message to either of us.

19:06.808 --> 19:08.408
If anything changes,

19:08.475 --> 19:09.910
or if you there's anything
you think we should know,

19:09.977 --> 19:11.278
please give us a call.

19:11.345 --> 19:12.745
Yeah.

19:12.814 --> 19:15.248
Here's a pin from
the vice president's office.

19:16.417 --> 19:17.951
Thank you.

19:18.019 --> 19:19.052
Okay.

19:33.201 --> 19:35.401
We're on.

20:58.585 --> 21:03.890
7-4-E, 8-3-F,
7-4-2, 7-2-2.

21:03.958 --> 21:09.095
F-66. 3-4-2.

21:09.163 --> 21:12.865
C-22.

21:12.934 --> 21:17.737
8-3-f, 7-4-2,
14-1-9,

21:17.805 --> 21:20.706
3-42.

21:20.774 --> 21:22.909
Hopefully that's that.

21:22.977 --> 21:24.911
Let's check the site again.

21:24.979 --> 21:27.314
Look, the president is okay.
We confirmed it.

21:27.381 --> 21:28.781
I don't think, reasonably speaking,

21:28.782 --> 21:30.083
that anyone can still believe

21:30.151 --> 21:31.651
that someone's gonna
take over the government.

21:31.718 --> 21:34.187
Can we just check the site?

21:38.059 --> 21:39.625
<i>Secretary of State Haig</i>

21:39.693 --> 21:42.262
<i>did say he is in control</i>
<i>at the White House.</i>

21:42.330 --> 21:45.231
<i>Sources have been unable</i>
<i>to get an official statement</i>

21:45.299 --> 21:47.067
<i>from the vice president as of yet.</i>

21:47.134 --> 21:49.569
<i>However, we understand</i>
<i>Vice President Bush</i>

21:49.636 --> 21:51.171
<i>is going directly to the White House.</i>

21:51.238 --> 21:54.174
We need to map our targets.
Oh, my God.

21:54.241 --> 21:56.242
Can you just stay with me here?

21:56.310 --> 21:59.179
Stay with you and what?
We're in the middle of a crisis.

21:59.246 --> 22:01.314
Yeah, and you don't think Moscow's
overreacting just a little?

22:01.382 --> 22:03.249
Well, you almost defected
a few weeks ago, Philip,

22:03.317 --> 22:05.151
so maybe you're not the one
to be passing judgment

22:05.219 --> 22:07.587
on whether or not
Moscow is overreacting.

22:07.654 --> 22:10.923
Do you think you could
just do what we need to do?

22:10.992 --> 22:13.426
<i>Though, of course,</i>
<i>we anxiously await word...</i>

22:13.494 --> 22:15.495
<i>...on president Reagan's</i>
<i>condition.</i>

22:15.562 --> 22:18.931
<i>Constitutionally, gentlemen,</i>
<i>you have the president...</i>

22:19.000 --> 22:21.334
The line of succession runs
through the vice president

22:21.402 --> 22:23.003
and speaker of the house.

22:23.070 --> 22:25.438
Well, not according to
Al "I'm in control here" Haig.

22:25.506 --> 22:26.672
It may not be legal,

22:26.740 --> 22:28.441
but it reflects a political reality.

22:28.509 --> 22:31.011
What? Seizing power?
Bush is on a plane.

22:31.078 --> 22:33.846
Someone has to step up to the
plate. Why don't you two relax?

22:33.914 --> 22:36.049
The president's been shot,
and your boss is out of control!

22:36.117 --> 22:38.051
At least my boss
isn't sitting on his ass.

22:38.119 --> 22:39.519
You want to get into this right now?

22:39.553 --> 22:42.489
Guys, guys, guys!
Jesus, sit down. Sit!

22:46.060 --> 22:50.397
<i>A single bullet that entered
just underneath his left arm...</i>

22:50.464 --> 22:52.232
Hi.

22:52.299 --> 22:54.300
Hey.

22:58.239 --> 23:00.006
I'm sorry.

23:00.074 --> 23:02.642
Oh, you don't have anything
to apologize for.

23:02.709 --> 23:05.045
No, I do.

23:05.112 --> 23:06.879
I've been thinking.

23:06.947 --> 23:09.082
It wasn't just the president
who got shot.

23:09.150 --> 23:10.517
Yeah?

23:10.584 --> 23:13.686
I've been watching it
over and over again.

23:13.754 --> 23:16.856
The footage
of that secret-service agent --

23:16.924 --> 23:19.492
he just turns and puts himself
in front of the gun

23:19.560 --> 23:21.094
and gets shot.

23:21.162 --> 23:22.995
It's horrible.

23:23.064 --> 23:25.865
It kind of makes me think
about your dad's job.

23:25.933 --> 23:27.200
Yeah.

23:27.268 --> 23:28.834
I try not to think about it too much,

23:28.902 --> 23:31.071
but today was hard.

23:31.138 --> 23:32.338
I'm sorry.

23:32.406 --> 23:34.541
And I'm sorry about what I said before.

23:34.608 --> 23:36.742
My dad doesn't do stuff like that.

23:36.810 --> 23:38.711
He's just a travel agent.

23:38.779 --> 23:44.084
Travel agenting is
more dangerous than you think.

23:44.151 --> 23:47.287
Yeah.
Planes get delayed.

23:47.354 --> 23:48.621
Boats leak.

23:48.689 --> 23:49.855
I can't stand it

23:49.923 --> 23:51.857
when there's gum stuck to my seat.

23:51.925 --> 23:56.429
Travel agenting is
a world filled with peril.

23:56.497 --> 23:59.799
I'll say.

24:14.215 --> 24:15.615
Anything on it?

24:15.682 --> 24:17.617
Yeah, it looks like at least an hour.

24:17.684 --> 24:19.619
So unless the Weinbergers were fighting,

24:19.686 --> 24:22.322
we'll have something to listen to.

24:22.389 --> 24:24.657
I got it.

24:30.797 --> 24:35.335
Neighborhood security.
First pass.

24:35.402 --> 24:37.337
If Weinberger's car is parked out front,

24:37.404 --> 24:39.339
you've got six seconds from front door.

24:39.406 --> 24:41.341
If he's blocked
by three security guards,

24:41.408 --> 24:43.343
I can still make two shots.

24:43.410 --> 24:48.080
Let's go map the rest of the targets.

24:48.149 --> 24:49.915
He's coming back.

24:49.983 --> 24:52.818
I got this.

24:56.590 --> 25:00.960
Oh. Hi.

25:01.028 --> 25:03.029
I'm -- I'm so glad I found you,
officer.

25:03.096 --> 25:05.365
I-I've got myself
totally turned around.

25:05.432 --> 25:06.666
I was trying to get
to the Key Bridge, um,

25:06.733 --> 25:08.334
get back over the --

25:08.402 --> 25:10.136
I keep making this turn,
and then I end up here.

25:10.204 --> 25:11.684
I'll be happy to give you directions,

25:11.738 --> 25:13.673
but I'm gonna need you
to step over to my car first.

25:13.740 --> 25:16.509
Oh. Sure. Of course.

25:16.577 --> 25:19.779
Um, can -- can you just tell me
what this is about?

25:19.846 --> 25:22.014
We've had a run of break-ins
in the neighborhood.

25:22.082 --> 25:24.617
Is there someone in the van with you?
Just my husband.

25:24.685 --> 25:26.619
Look, we're just
trying to get to Washington.

25:26.687 --> 25:28.354
I'm sorry for the inconvenience, ma'am.

25:28.422 --> 25:30.456
I'm gonna need identification
from both of you.

25:30.524 --> 25:34.860
Sure. Yes. Of course.

25:34.928 --> 25:37.630
I'm gonna need to call this in.

25:37.698 --> 25:40.400
The McLean Police
are gonna want to swing by

25:40.467 --> 25:43.002
just to ask you a few routine questions,

25:43.070 --> 25:44.704
take a look inside the van.

25:44.771 --> 25:46.739
Oh, God. Is there any way
you can do it?

25:46.807 --> 25:48.575
No can do.
Company policy.

25:48.642 --> 25:51.844
Sorry, ma'am,
you don't look like a burglar,

25:51.912 --> 25:53.813
but we've got to call in
on every vehicle parked

25:53.880 --> 25:56.015
along the side of the road.

25:56.083 --> 25:59.085
It won't take more
than 15 minutes, I promise.

26:30.744 --> 26:33.715
Well, if there is a war, we
might have the first shot...

26:34.183 --> 26:35.157
If there is a war,

26:35.168 --> 26:36.568
we're not the ones who started it.

26:38.064 --> 26:39.304
We just killed a security guard

26:39.342 --> 26:41.181
down the street
from the secretary of defense.

26:41.743 --> 26:43.176
We're riding around
with enough explosives

26:43.245 --> 26:44.811
to blow up half
the government buildings in D.C.

26:44.879 --> 26:47.381
We're mapping sniper shots
to take out key U.S. leadership.

26:47.449 --> 26:49.983
If anyone's escalated things, it's us.

26:50.051 --> 26:51.852
I'm not making the decisions.

26:51.919 --> 26:53.454
No, but you agree with them.

26:53.521 --> 26:55.122
I think the Americans
are capable of anything.

26:55.189 --> 26:57.725
Do you listen to what they say?
What they say about us?

26:57.792 --> 27:00.661
Do you listen to <i>yourself</i>
when you talk about them?

27:00.729 --> 27:01.962
What is that supposed to mean?

27:02.029 --> 27:05.432
Nothing. Forget it.

27:16.378 --> 27:18.712
Are you clean?

27:18.780 --> 27:21.348
I hope so.

27:21.416 --> 27:23.550
Are you all right?
You can't do that!

27:23.618 --> 27:25.486
You can't call me at the embassy ever!

27:25.553 --> 27:29.390
Everyone is --
it's crazy.

27:29.457 --> 27:32.593
Are you trying to get me killed?

27:32.661 --> 27:34.361
Is that what you want?!
You want to get me killed?!

27:34.429 --> 27:35.562
It's gonna be all right.

27:35.630 --> 27:38.766
I promise you it's gonna be okay.

27:38.833 --> 27:41.402
How do you know?

27:41.469 --> 27:42.869
I called you from a line

27:42.937 --> 27:44.438
that will trace back
to the Kennedy Center.

27:44.506 --> 27:46.873
What if you were followed?
I wasn't.

27:46.941 --> 27:49.276
How do you know?
How can you be sure?

27:49.344 --> 27:51.512
Because I'm the one
who does the following.

27:51.579 --> 27:53.781
It's what I do.

27:59.253 --> 28:01.789
What do you know
about the assassination attempt?

28:01.856 --> 28:05.025
I don't know anything.

28:05.092 --> 28:08.228
Everyone is freaking out.

28:08.296 --> 28:10.798
We're all running around
like cut-off chickens.

28:10.865 --> 28:13.266
"With their heads cut off."

28:13.335 --> 28:15.536
What?

28:15.603 --> 28:17.270
The expression is,

28:17.339 --> 28:19.940
"Running around like chickens
with their heads cut off."

28:20.007 --> 28:21.942
You think this is a joke.

28:22.009 --> 28:25.446
No, I don't think this is a joke, Nina.

28:28.350 --> 28:32.720
Why is the KGB running around
like cut-off chickens?

28:32.787 --> 28:37.725
Because they're afraid you'll
try and stick Hinckley on us.

28:37.792 --> 28:39.560
Why would we do that?

28:39.627 --> 28:41.161
To justify the coup.

28:41.229 --> 28:42.596
What coup?

28:42.664 --> 28:44.598
The one your General Haig announced.

28:44.666 --> 28:47.067
You're serious.

28:47.134 --> 28:49.102
He's one of your top generals,

28:49.170 --> 28:51.638
and he's announced he's taking control.

28:51.706 --> 28:53.073
What would you call that?

28:53.140 --> 28:54.508
No, that's not what happened.

28:54.576 --> 28:57.845
Both sides have their fingers
on the trigger,

28:57.912 --> 28:59.780
and that's how it happens.

28:59.848 --> 29:02.516
How it happens?

29:02.584 --> 29:05.753
One mistake.

29:05.820 --> 29:08.889
That's all it takes.

29:18.833 --> 29:21.635
Hmm.

29:21.703 --> 29:24.471
<i>I-I don't know...</i>

29:24.539 --> 29:25.873
<i>...coming back</i>
<i>or if they even...</i>

29:27.174 --> 29:28.509
Security radios, interference.

29:30.578 --> 29:32.345
<i>Can we get</i>
<i>some refreshments in here?</i>

29:32.414 --> 29:34.681
<i>We're expecting them in about...</i>

29:36.551 --> 29:39.953
Great. Now we'll never know
what refreshments they served.

29:40.021 --> 29:41.354
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>and they should go on alert</i>

29:41.423 --> 29:42.989
<i>or be ready to go on alert.</i>

29:43.057 --> 29:45.626
<i>They're not on...alert?</i>

29:45.693 --> 29:47.461
<i>The crews who are normally on alert</i>

29:47.529 --> 29:49.863
<i>24 hours a day</i>
<i>are moving from the base...</i>

29:49.931 --> 29:51.565
<i>...Planes, which saves</i>

29:51.633 --> 29:55.168
<i>3 1/2 to 4 minutes</i>
<i>if they need to get in the air.</i>

29:55.236 --> 29:56.804
<i>The nearest submarine is...</i>

29:56.871 --> 29:58.672
<i>...minutes,</i>
<i>44 seconds off,</i>

29:58.740 --> 30:00.874
<i>which is about, uh,</i>
<i>two minutes closer than normal.</i>

30:02.444 --> 30:03.811
<i>Nearest Soviet sub...</i>

30:03.878 --> 30:06.179
<i>Cap...minutes, 57 seconds.</i>

30:06.247 --> 30:12.218
<i>How the hell did</i>
<i>Haig get...nuclear football?</i>

30:14.288 --> 30:16.389
Are you convinced now?

30:19.126 --> 30:22.262
No, I'm not.
Because it's not clear.

30:22.330 --> 30:25.098
He sounded upset.

30:25.166 --> 30:26.733
He said,
"General Haig get..."

30:26.801 --> 30:28.535
And he made a reference

30:28.603 --> 30:30.537
to the copy of the briefcase
with the missile-launch codes

30:30.605 --> 30:32.405
that could authorize a nuclear attack.

30:32.474 --> 30:34.775
Yeah.
We need to get this to Moscow.

30:34.843 --> 30:37.010
Okay, but let's check it out and get

30:37.078 --> 30:38.679
some more information first.

30:38.746 --> 30:41.515
More infor-- he's getting ready
to make a move.

30:41.583 --> 30:43.350
Nobody can challenge him
if he has the capability

30:43.417 --> 30:44.618
to launch America's nuclear arsenal.

30:46.153 --> 30:47.921
What more do you need,
a written manifesto?

30:47.989 --> 30:49.723
Is there one available?

30:49.791 --> 30:52.726
Philip, please. Philip.

30:52.794 --> 30:54.427
Can we please move on this now?

30:54.496 --> 30:57.063
He's holding a copy
of the nuclear football.

30:57.131 --> 31:00.701
We need to transmit.

31:00.768 --> 31:02.536
All these years walking these streets,

31:02.604 --> 31:04.938
living with these people,

31:05.006 --> 31:07.975
you still really don't
understand this place.

31:08.042 --> 31:10.377
Haig could have 10 nuclear footballs.

31:10.444 --> 31:11.945
This still wouldn't be a coup.

31:12.013 --> 31:14.381
Really?
Yes, really.

31:14.448 --> 31:17.484
And if we send that to Moscow,
they will go on high alert.

31:17.552 --> 31:19.319
And our command control
isn't quite state-of-the-art.

31:19.387 --> 31:20.387
We will escalate.

31:20.454 --> 31:21.622
They will escalate.

31:21.689 --> 31:22.723
This thing will spin out of control.

31:22.790 --> 31:24.124
So could you please --

31:24.191 --> 31:27.961
can you please just try and get yourself

31:28.029 --> 31:30.130
in a different way
of looking at it for one minute?

31:30.197 --> 31:32.499
You think you understand things
so much better than I do.

31:32.567 --> 31:34.167
Why?

31:34.235 --> 31:37.004
Because you look good in an American suit?
What?

31:37.071 --> 31:39.991
Because everybody loves talking to you
because you think like the kids do?

31:40.041 --> 31:42.242
No, that's not what I think --
Because I fit in just fine,

31:42.309 --> 31:44.845
but I remember
where I came from --

31:44.913 --> 31:47.480
not having all of these things,

31:47.549 --> 31:50.283
it being about something bigger
than just myself.

31:50.351 --> 31:51.397
I remember, too.

31:51.517 --> 31:53.153
That doesn't blind me
to what's in front of my face.

31:53.220 --> 31:54.688
I know how the Americans do things,

31:54.756 --> 31:57.257
and Al Haig isn't taking over
the government.

31:57.324 --> 31:58.645
You don't think they're all about

31:58.693 --> 32:00.497
lies and conspiracy
like everybody else?!

32:00.617 --> 32:01.553
Because they are!

32:01.673 --> 32:04.276
Why do you think that they're so
different, that they're so pure?!

32:04.396 --> 32:07.500
I don't. But the last two times
our leaders died,

32:07.569 --> 32:09.859
our government pretended
they weren't dead for weeks.

32:09.979 --> 32:11.421
Things are different here.

32:11.651 --> 32:13.285
Philip.
Look, you're the one

32:13.353 --> 32:14.954
who keeps saying
how dangerous things are

32:15.133 --> 32:16.454
and how we're at the edge of war.

32:16.485 --> 32:19.384
I say our job is to try
and stop that from happening.

32:19.504 --> 32:22.327
And you know
what we're gonna do for once?

32:22.396 --> 32:24.387
We're gonna do it my way.

32:39.579 --> 32:43.247
Are you sure?
The Soviets have nothing to do with anything.

32:43.367 --> 32:45.034
The A.G.'s
on the line for you.

32:45.102 --> 32:47.069
They want all the division heads
on for this conference call.

32:47.137 --> 32:48.705
When they get all
the division heads at once,

32:48.773 --> 32:50.840
it means nothing's happening.

32:50.908 --> 32:53.543
Gaad. Yes.

32:53.611 --> 32:55.745
<i>Sources</i>
<i>at George Washington Hospital</i>

32:55.813 --> 32:58.381
<i>tell us that President Reagan</i>
<i>came out of surgery...</i>

33:02.286 --> 33:04.220
Look, if you've got something to say...

33:04.288 --> 33:06.055
I'm good.

33:06.123 --> 33:07.424
I saw the car.

33:07.491 --> 33:08.825
There was glare from the streetlight.

33:08.893 --> 33:10.059
I-I couldn't see
their faces.

33:10.127 --> 33:11.528
I couldn't see the license plate,

33:11.595 --> 33:12.929
but I saw the car.
Look, you know what, Chris?

33:12.996 --> 33:15.097
Next time you get glare
kicked back at you,

33:15.165 --> 33:16.699
just put it out on the radio.

33:16.767 --> 33:17.834
I'll act accordingly.

33:23.073 --> 33:24.607
<i>While the president</i>
<i>remains in recovery,</i>

33:24.675 --> 33:26.443
<i>tensions continue around the world.</i>

33:26.510 --> 33:28.277

33:30.147 --> 33:31.714

33:45.362 --> 33:47.530

<i>It's billions of lives</i>

33:58.776 --> 34:02.111
Hey, dad. When were
37 million people killed?

34:02.179 --> 34:04.246
You don't have to worry about that.

34:04.314 --> 34:05.882
It's history, which repeats itself,

34:05.950 --> 34:07.951
so he does have to worry about it.

34:08.018 --> 34:09.619
<i>Cloud cover over Eastern Europe</i>

34:19.029 --> 34:20.396
Stan's home.

34:20.464 --> 34:21.797
Maybe we should go over there

34:21.866 --> 34:24.634
and see how they got through the day.

34:24.702 --> 34:28.337
Sure.

34:28.405 --> 34:31.340
Stan?
Ohh, what a day, huh?

34:31.408 --> 34:33.576
I just --
I can't even believe it.

34:33.643 --> 34:34.978
Yeah, how are you guys doing?
Come in. Have some wine.

34:35.045 --> 34:36.178
Oh, we're good.
How are you guys?

34:36.246 --> 34:37.580
Uh, are the kids all right?

34:37.648 --> 34:39.181
Yeah, I mean, Henry's still so young.

34:39.248 --> 34:40.617
I don't think he really even gets it,

34:40.684 --> 34:42.018
which is fine.

34:42.085 --> 34:44.286
And Paige is a teenager,
so, you know, who knows?

34:44.353 --> 34:46.688
Well, that's good.
I remember with Kennedy, I --

34:46.757 --> 34:49.826
a guy in a sandwich shop told me
what had happened,

34:49.893 --> 34:51.460
and I-I just jumped in my car
and drove to my parents' house.

34:51.529 --> 34:53.161
I just --
I just wanted to be home.

34:53.230 --> 34:57.166
Yeah. Nothing really
felt safe after that.

34:57.234 --> 34:58.701
Yeah.
Yeah.

34:58.769 --> 35:02.705
So, were -- were you involved
in this at work?

35:02.773 --> 35:05.542
Oh, yeah, yeah, we all were.
Right. Thanks.

35:05.609 --> 35:08.144
Do you think it's gonna be all right?

35:08.211 --> 35:09.979
What do you mean?

35:10.047 --> 35:13.550
Just -- I mean,
we were just watching the news,

35:13.617 --> 35:14.851
and they--
they're talking about war.

35:14.919 --> 35:16.719
I mean, how worried do we need to be?

35:16.787 --> 35:19.722
Oh, no, no.
This is all gonna blow over.

35:19.790 --> 35:22.158
I got to, uh,
peek at the file of the guy

35:22.225 --> 35:23.492
who shot the president --
Hinckley.

35:23.561 --> 35:26.062
And he is totally nuts, 100%.

35:26.129 --> 35:27.697
Really?

35:27.765 --> 35:30.132
Yeah, he actually thought
that he was going to impress

35:30.200 --> 35:33.970
this movie star, Jodie Foster.

35:34.038 --> 35:36.372
But -- I'm sorry, by doing what,
shooting the president?

35:36.440 --> 35:38.841
Like I said, he's 100% nuts.
I mean, certifiably looney.

35:38.909 --> 35:42.579
Wow. So you got
to investigate him.

35:42.646 --> 35:46.883
I thought -- d-didn't --
I thought you worked against spies.

35:46.951 --> 35:48.752
Counterintelligence, yeah,
but we were worried

35:48.786 --> 35:50.553
that the Russians
might have been involved,

35:50.621 --> 35:51.988
so we had to check that out.

35:52.056 --> 35:53.590
Oh, my God.

35:53.657 --> 35:56.425
But i-it turns out that they --
they weren't.

35:56.493 --> 35:59.696
Which is a good thing because,
you know, that, uh...

35:59.763 --> 36:02.031
Well, that could have started
World War III.

36:02.099 --> 36:05.468
Yeah.

37:30.220 --> 37:31.988
You all right?

37:32.056 --> 37:33.489
Sure. Yeah.

37:35.525 --> 37:37.093
Oh.

37:37.161 --> 37:39.295
Man, it's a hell of a day, huh?

37:39.362 --> 37:40.763
Yeah.

37:47.104 --> 37:49.271
What is it?

37:51.108 --> 37:53.275
What?

37:53.343 --> 37:55.277
No, never mind.

37:55.345 --> 37:56.813
Feels sort of petty

37:56.880 --> 37:58.815
to even think about
that kind of thing right now.

37:58.882 --> 38:01.450
Think about what?
I don't know what you're talking about, Sandra.

38:01.518 --> 38:02.852
It's kind of my point.

38:04.855 --> 38:07.890
Okay, I'm feeling like I need a
crystal ball for this conversation.

38:11.195 --> 38:13.529
Okay. Uh...

38:16.533 --> 38:17.834
You know, I was happy.

38:17.901 --> 38:20.469
I was happy
when we were in St. Louis.

38:20.537 --> 38:21.871
Matthew and I,

38:21.939 --> 38:23.639
we made a life for ourselves
when you were away.

38:23.707 --> 38:26.743
I mean, I had a job.
I had friends, like...

38:26.810 --> 38:28.177
Matthew liked his school.

38:28.245 --> 38:30.246
We were kind of close to my parents,

38:30.313 --> 38:32.715
and the only thing
that was missing was you.

38:32.783 --> 38:36.219
And then your assignment
was finally over

38:36.286 --> 38:38.654
and  you're back.

38:38.722 --> 38:41.057
Or...

38:41.125 --> 38:43.559
some version of you is back.

38:45.629 --> 38:49.766
And then we just, you know,
suddenly move here

38:49.833 --> 38:51.734
and start this whole life and...

38:51.802 --> 38:53.569
I thought you wanted me
to take this job,

38:53.637 --> 38:54.937
to come to D.C.

38:55.005 --> 38:56.438
I did.

38:56.506 --> 38:58.174
I did, but I thought
we were gonna get the chance

38:58.242 --> 39:00.609
to get to know each other again,
living in the same house.

39:00.677 --> 39:02.044
Well, that's what we're doing.

39:02.112 --> 39:04.213
Stan.
What?

39:04.281 --> 39:06.615
You never talk to me.

39:10.620 --> 39:12.955
Why is it so hard?

39:13.023 --> 39:15.691
I don't know.

39:15.759 --> 39:19.896
Just tell me.

39:19.963 --> 39:23.299
I was living with psycho
militants for too long, okay?

39:23.366 --> 39:24.667
I don't know.

39:33.877 --> 39:36.813
I don't know how to...

39:36.880 --> 39:39.081
How to what?

39:39.149 --> 39:42.384
It just doesn't feel like it did before.

39:51.235 --> 39:52.895
I'm trying.

40:02.072 --> 40:04.640
It's okay. I'm awake.

40:04.708 --> 40:09.578
Site was clear.
Transmission was good.

40:09.646 --> 40:12.414
Radio news was quiet on the way home.

40:12.482 --> 40:13.749
Good.

40:20.858 --> 40:22.992
I, um...

40:23.060 --> 40:24.360
I...

40:29.933 --> 40:32.368
I just, uh...

40:35.339 --> 40:38.107
I'm glad we did it your way this time.

40:38.175 --> 40:41.010
It all worked out.

40:42.712 --> 40:46.715
The center was lucky to have you
on the ground today.

40:49.419 --> 40:53.189
If Moscow ever finds out we sat
on the Haig intelligence,

40:53.257 --> 40:55.091
we're finished.

41:06.870 --> 41:09.705
I won't tell if you won't.
