WEBVTT

00:01.275 --> 00:03.441
Sometimes I get up in
the middle of the night,

00:03.472 --> 00:06.343
and just... walk around the house

00:06.710 --> 00:08.055
for hours.

00:08.093 --> 00:09.526
(Marty) You're gettin' old.

00:09.825 --> 00:12.260
The older we get, the less we sleep.

00:12.294 --> 00:15.830
I sleep 45 minutes a night now, tops.

00:15.864 --> 00:16.964
Ser... seriously, Marty?

00:16.999 --> 00:19.161
You... you only sleep
for 45 minutes a night?

00:19.281 --> 00:20.475
Tops.

00:20.475 --> 00:22.055
And how long do you spend in the steam?

00:22.086 --> 00:25.308
I try to get anywhere
between eight and ten hours.

00:25.832 --> 00:27.741
I'm gonna get a smoothie.

00:27.749 --> 00:30.510
You know, Marty, I'm realizing,
I don't know much about you.

00:30.630 --> 00:32.503
It seems like all our exchanges are limited

00:32.543 --> 00:34.130
to you telling me to shut the
steam room door. (Chuckles)

00:34.170 --> 00:35.640
(Chuckles) Yeah.

00:35.760 --> 00:37.637
(Door closes)

00:38.839 --> 00:41.708
Okay. Well... (Clears
throat) have a great day.

00:41.742 --> 00:43.015
I've worked the same job,

00:43.007 --> 00:45.267
lived in the same house,
and ate the same breakfast

00:45.282 --> 00:47.644
every day for the past 50 years.

00:48.065 --> 00:49.177
The... the same breakfast?

00:49.177 --> 00:50.843
Corned beef hash and eggs.

00:50.858 --> 00:53.861
And I've worn the same
shirt every damn day... 

00:53.877 --> 00:56.322
a solid Oxford button-down.

00:56.356 --> 00:59.692
And I never set one
foot outside of Chatswin.

00:59.727 --> 01:00.843
You're kidding.

01:00.878 --> 01:02.278
I'm not a kidder.

01:02.312 --> 01:04.147
Y... wh... why not?

01:04.181 --> 01:05.963
Oh, my parents never joked.

01:05.968 --> 01:08.705
No, no. Why didn't you ever leave Chatswin?

01:08.721 --> 01:11.575
Didn't you... I don't know,
ever want to travel or... 

01:11.588 --> 01:12.855
Of course I did,

01:12.890 --> 01:15.157
but I had to wait for
the right time, George.

01:15.446 --> 01:18.801
I've got 3,000 vacation days saved up

01:19.028 --> 01:21.366
and a closet full of non-Oxfords.

01:21.382 --> 01:24.049
Prints, plaids, Hawaiians... 

01:24.033 --> 01:26.043
some real whimsical (Bleep).

01:26.446 --> 01:28.108
This time next year,

01:28.154 --> 01:31.082
I'll be exploring the great wide open.

01:31.541 --> 01:34.450
That... that sounds great, Marty.

01:34.487 --> 01:35.412
Yep.

01:35.834 --> 01:38.540
The best years of my life are ahead of me.

01:38.574 --> 01:40.174
(Emergency radio chatter)

01:40.294 --> 01:41.493
(Siren wailing)

01:41.527 --> 01:43.044
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

01:43.866 --> 01:45.501
There's nothing you coulda done, buddy.

01:45.621 --> 01:49.161
<i>Marty is schvitzing in the
big steam room in the sky now.</i>

01:49.654 --> 01:51.367
<i>(Tessa) George wasn't the only one</i>

01:51.374 --> 01:52.602
<i>who had blindsided.</i>

01:52.657 --> 01:55.785
I can't believe Ryan lied... to me.

01:55.777 --> 01:56.670
And you're just as guilty.

01:56.678 --> 01:58.578
You let me believe that
he was at an away game

01:58.578 --> 01:59.477
instead of... 

02:00.111 --> 02:02.013
wherever he was.

02:02.048 --> 02:04.076
Tessa, when you first
started dating my brother,

02:04.130 --> 02:05.952
you put me in a very awkward place.

02:05.937 --> 02:08.384
You think you know somebody.
You wear their letterman jacket.

02:08.505 --> 02:10.270
You put your tongue on top of their tongue

02:10.255 --> 02:11.631
and you move it around,

02:11.670 --> 02:14.579
only to find out that they are a lying liar

02:14.699 --> 02:17.207
who lies their lies directly to your face.

02:17.231 --> 02:18.844
Look, I know how you feel.

02:18.849 --> 02:20.531
I experienced the same sense of betrayal

02:20.524 --> 02:23.261
when I found out the real deal
about high fructose corn syrup.

02:23.381 --> 02:25.998
I mean, sugar is sugar.

02:26.772 --> 02:27.750

02:40.753 --> 02:42.272
Is that what I think it is?

02:42.296 --> 02:44.345
If you think it's chocolate cake, then yes.

02:44.353 --> 02:45.933
Otherwise, no.

02:46.053 --> 02:47.692
I specifically asked for no chocolate cake.

02:47.700 --> 02:48.880
Marty hated chocolate cake.

02:48.912 --> 02:51.101
He did? I thought he loved chocolate cake.

02:51.977 --> 02:53.659
Well, hold on.

02:53.779 --> 02:55.347
Now you've got me second-guessing myself.

02:55.348 --> 02:56.670
Did he love chocolate cake?

02:56.701 --> 02:58.258
You know what? Now I'm backpedaling.

02:58.289 --> 02:59.337
I love chocolate cake.

02:59.345 --> 03:01.355
Maybe I just assumed Marty did, too.

03:01.362 --> 03:03.108
Well, it's not like we can ask him.

03:03.142 --> 03:05.227
(Laughs)

03:05.977 --> 03:07.659
Maybe I should just take the cake home

03:07.651 --> 03:09.082
and enjoy it with my family.

03:09.202 --> 03:12.375
No. I think we both know he
wouldn't have wanted that.

03:12.391 --> 03:14.065
(Whispers) Why don't
we just set it right... 

03:14.088 --> 03:16.387
(Dishes clatter)

03:17.349 --> 03:19.680
(George) Oh, hash and eggs.

03:19.696 --> 03:21.447
Hey. What's that buddy?

03:21.567 --> 03:22.261
(Clears throat) Oh, nothing.

03:22.253 --> 03:24.122
It's just, we should have
had corned beef hash and eggs.

03:24.106 --> 03:25.319
It was Marty's favorite.

03:25.366 --> 03:27.681
It was? I didn't know that.

03:28.150 --> 03:31.677

03:36.533 --> 03:38.574
You're not allowed in here

03:38.694 --> 03:40.146
Then what's your excuse?

03:40.177 --> 03:41.421
<i>(Chuckles) Burn.</i>

03:41.460 --> 03:42.719
Shut up, Jason.

03:42.688 --> 03:44.737
You pee sitting down like a girl.

03:45.113 --> 03:46.427
I'm pooing, you idiot.

03:46.466 --> 03:49.008
It doesn't sound like you're pooing to me.

03:49.128 --> 03:50.595
'Cause I'm on antibiotics.

03:50.715 --> 03:52.246
Okay, maybe this isn't the best place

03:52.300 --> 03:54.083
- to get into this. Oh, hold on.
- Hold on. Tessa, wait. Wait.

03:54.099 --> 03:55.804
Tessa, wait. Just let me explain.

03:55.804 --> 03:57.548
I'm sorry I lied about where I was,

03:57.548 --> 03:58.252
but it's not my fault.

03:58.267 --> 03:59.206
I'm being pursued.

03:59.206 --> 04:00.605
Oh, let me guess. Some stupid cheerleader

04:00.590 --> 04:03.233
or that foreign exchange
student with the braless perkies?

04:03.225 --> 04:04.492
What? No, Tessa.

04:04.508 --> 04:06.314
I'm not being pursued by girls.

04:06.434 --> 04:07.933
Well, I am, but that's
not what I was off doing.

04:07.949 --> 04:09.857
I'm being pursued by colleges

04:09.904 --> 04:11.578
for football.

04:12.164 --> 04:13.305
(Sighs)

04:13.321 --> 04:15.230
Oh. (Exhales)

04:16.387 --> 04:18.194
I mean... 

04:18.505 --> 04:19.899
Oh!

04:19.946 --> 04:21.524
That's great.

04:21.877 --> 04:24.255
Why did you lie to me about that?

04:25.016 --> 04:27.820
I wasn't sure how you'd
feel about me going away.

04:28.109 --> 04:31.066
Well, give me some credit, Ryan.

04:31.081 --> 04:32.880
So how do you feel?

04:33.000 --> 04:35.062
(Sighs deeply)

04:35.593 --> 04:37.361
I feel great about it.

04:37.481 --> 04:40.498
I mean, I'm... I'm fine with it.

04:40.618 --> 04:43.236
Of course you're going
away. I'm going away, too.

04:43.290 --> 04:45.957
That's what kids do.

04:46.304 --> 04:48.372

Friends... (Clears throat)

05:58.033 --> 05:59.261
We've gathered here

05:59.277 --> 06:02.475
to celebrate the life of a great man,

06:02.919 --> 06:05.815
of a kind man, a caring man.

06:06.808 --> 06:09.008
But first, a little housekeeping.

06:09.042 --> 06:12.119
Um, Kathy Greenspan
misplaced a pearl earring.

06:12.150 --> 06:14.379
So let's all keep an eye out for that.

06:14.499 --> 06:16.045
(Mouths word) A last-minute reminder,

06:16.066 --> 06:17.616
the pool reopens next week.

06:17.650 --> 06:20.186
And speaking of strokes,

06:20.220 --> 06:22.955
let's get back to Marty's
memorial. (Chuckles)

Trust me. Tried it my first year at Brown.

06:39.180 --> 06:40.040

06:40.063 --> 06:42.675
And besides, as soon as
you get out of Chatswin,

06:42.730 --> 06:45.210
you're gonna have a whole new perspective.

06:45.249 --> 06:46.735
Hey, guys.

06:46.985 --> 06:49.762
Tessa, I want you to meet
two more Chatswin refugees.

Mr. George Altman.

07:34.914 --> 07:36.458
I barely knew the guy.
What do you want me to say?

07:36.578 --> 07:37.818
(Whispering) Look, this
is pathetic, George.

07:37.850 --> 07:39.868
I can't have a postal
worker eulogize Marty.

07:39.902 --> 07:41.136
Tell that story.

07:41.170 --> 07:42.770
The story you told me earlier,

07:42.805 --> 07:45.673
the great one about
the... corned beef hash.

07:45.708 --> 07:47.579
What great story, that he used to eat it?

07:47.595 --> 07:49.060
That's the one.

07:49.111 --> 07:51.794
Look, I would do this myself
except that I'm too emotional.

07:51.787 --> 07:54.235
I'm still grappling with my loss of Carmen.

07:54.289 --> 07:55.717
(Chuckles) The loss of Carmen?

07:55.751 --> 07:57.653
Noah, your housekeeper didn't die.

07:57.652 --> 07:59.303
She's just working for another family.

07:59.357 --> 08:00.288
(Speaks inaudibly)

08:00.306 --> 08:02.040

Hi.

08:06.628 --> 08:08.062
Hi, George!

08:09.251 --> 08:11.386
Well, uh, what can I say about Marty?

08:11.589 --> 08:13.622
I know what he liked to eat for breakfast.

08:13.742 --> 08:15.922
I know how much he loved to steam.

08:19.356 --> 08:20.959
But the truth is... 

08:20.993 --> 08:23.610
I didn't know Marty.

08:25.189 --> 08:27.515
I guess none of us did.

08:28.396 --> 08:32.370
And as... as touching
as Dalia's tribute was... 

08:32.807 --> 08:34.839
I'm not sure they ever even met.

08:34.874 --> 08:36.457
We didn't.

08:38.460 --> 08:41.312
The fact that we didn't know Marty... 

08:41.347 --> 08:43.131
(Sighs)

08:43.442 --> 08:46.000
that might be the biggest tragedy of all.

08:48.304 --> 08:50.434
(Clapping)

08:53.679 --> 08:55.727
- Here.
- What's this?

08:55.778 --> 08:56.895
It's Marty.

08:56.946 --> 08:58.308
The club wants you to have him.

08:58.308 --> 08:59.531
Oh.

08:59.565 --> 09:00.866
Me?

09:00.920 --> 09:02.625
Of all the people who didn't know him,

09:02.657 --> 09:04.285
you didn't know him the least.

09:04.320 --> 09:05.472
Oh, come on.

09:05.454 --> 09:06.574
There's gotta be a more meaningful

09:06.559 --> 09:08.780
final resting place for Marty than with me.

09:08.811 --> 09:11.543
Perhaps, but no backsies.

09:11.577 --> 09:13.161
Uh, o... okay.

09:13.605 --> 09:16.331
Seriously, no backsies.

09:27.612 --> 09:29.075
Did she break up with you?

09:29.130 --> 09:30.225
It was hard to tell.

09:30.345 --> 09:31.929
Well, did she say,

09:31.937 --> 09:34.166
"I don't want to go out with you anymore"?

09:34.213 --> 09:36.020
Not with her words.

09:36.325 --> 09:37.780
Hey, maybe I should defer for a year

09:37.803 --> 09:39.086
and stay in Chatswin.

09:39.109 --> 09:40.728
Then I can apply to whatever
school she's going to,

09:40.736 --> 09:42.182
and we can be together.

09:42.302 --> 09:43.316
Mnh-mnh. That's not gonna work.

09:43.436 --> 09:43.943
Oh.

09:43.966 --> 09:45.671
Yeah, Tessa's gonna attend a school

09:45.679 --> 09:47.720
that values a curious mind,

09:47.840 --> 09:49.691
creativity, hard work,

09:49.714 --> 09:51.161
intellect.

09:51.281 --> 09:53.750
Whereas, you're most likely going to attend

09:53.773 --> 09:55.111
the university of Florida.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.049
Damn, this perfect body!

09:57.472 --> 09:59.084
Life would be so much simpler

09:59.092 --> 10:01.570
if I were soft and
misshapen like you, Lisa.

10:06.686 --> 10:08.969
The lord has given you a gift.

10:09.290 --> 10:12.434
You have a perfect body.
That's your cross to bear.

10:13.342 --> 10:14.827
Mine's that I'm a lady in the street

10:14.851 --> 10:17.197
and a freak in the bed.

10:22.685 --> 10:24.335
(Door opens)

10:24.370 --> 10:25.970
(Dallas) Midday to you,
George. (Door closes)

10:26.021 --> 10:27.459
Really? Is it midday already?

10:27.579 --> 10:29.441
It sure is.

10:29.475 --> 10:30.861
How about a little... 

10:30.884 --> 10:32.002
afternoon delight?

10:31.995 --> 10:33.347
D... Dallas, please.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.062
Marty is right here.

10:35.081 --> 10:37.115
Oh. Hey, Marty.

10:37.149 --> 10:38.933
Did he say "hey" back?

10:38.968 --> 10:40.988
He doesn't communicate through me.

10:41.108 --> 10:43.061
I'm just in charge of his ashes somehow.

10:43.444 --> 10:46.509
Oh. Well, should we take
Marty's ashes to a movie?

10:46.532 --> 10:47.174
I don't know.

10:47.166 --> 10:48.222
Frankly, I have no idea

10:48.276 --> 10:50.404
where Marty would want his ashes to be.

10:50.693 --> 10:54.150
This... this whole thing is weighing on me.

10:54.597 --> 10:57.833
I mean, I'm in charge of
his final resting place?

10:57.867 --> 10:59.668
(Chuckles) Me?

10:59.719 --> 11:02.020
I... I don't know where he'd want to rest.

11:02.054 --> 11:04.721
Well, how about the club?

11:04.723 --> 11:06.608
It was his favorite place to be.

11:06.643 --> 11:09.025
<i>(Dallas) You could leave
Marty's ashes in his locker.</i>

11:09.072 --> 11:10.579
I feel weird about this.

11:10.613 --> 11:12.614
We're breaking into a dead man's locker.

11:12.622 --> 11:15.148
Yeah, but we have the
dead man here with us,

11:15.140 --> 11:16.435
and he's cool with it.

11:18.555 --> 11:20.656
You're cool with it, aren't ya, Marty?

11:22.809 --> 11:24.400
Did he say he was cool with it?

11:24.376 --> 11:26.104
He doesn't speak through me.

11:27.247 --> 11:29.498
(Sighs) Okay.

11:32.519 --> 11:34.347
(Grunts) Break it.

11:34.394 --> 11:35.505
(Wood cracking) (Grunts)

11:35.896 --> 11:36.905
Mm!

11:39.055 --> 11:39.876
Yeesh.

11:39.892 --> 11:40.932
(Crowbar clanks)

11:40.955 --> 11:42.621
Foot powder, tooth powder,

11:42.741 --> 11:43.911
medicated powder... 

11:44.031 --> 11:45.913
who knew that Marty was a man

11:45.940 --> 11:48.058
<i>of this many powders?</i>

11:48.533 --> 11:50.785
And now ironically, he himself is a powder.

11:50.832 --> 11:53.230
You know what? I... I don't
feel comfortable with this.

11:53.264 --> 11:56.166
I can't believe there
wasn't anyone in his life

11:56.286 --> 11:58.118
that he was close to.

12:00.061 --> 12:02.105
Hey. Check it out.

12:02.139 --> 12:03.251
What?

12:03.274 --> 12:04.724
Bora Bora.

12:05.074 --> 12:06.919
Well done, Mr. Krupp.

12:07.895 --> 12:10.664
And there's a second ticket.

12:10.698 --> 12:13.434
A second ticket? You know what that means.

12:13.465 --> 12:17.102
You and I are going to Bora Bora! (Laughs)

12:17.222 --> 12:18.712
- No.
- No?

12:18.720 --> 12:21.293
No, it means there was
someone in Marty's life.

12:21.293 --> 12:23.076
Someone he wanted to travel with.

12:23.115 --> 12:25.548
Someone that would know what
to do with Marty's ashes.

12:25.563 --> 12:26.728
And that someone

12:26.768 --> 12:30.498
is Fatima... Smadja.

12:31.843 --> 12:33.595
Perfect.

12:35.526 --> 12:38.178
Well, what a pleasant surprise.

12:38.381 --> 12:39.726
What brings the Shay train

12:39.757 --> 12:42.682
ambling through the Jarrison Station today?

12:42.721 --> 12:44.105
Can I ask you a question?

12:44.128 --> 12:46.623
So long as it's not
about the trial. (Laughs)

12:46.743 --> 12:48.109
J.K.

12:48.485 --> 12:49.924
If someone gives you a gift,

12:49.924 --> 12:51.550
does it mean you have to keep it?

12:51.887 --> 12:55.132
Well, it depends. Who's the gift from?

12:55.320 --> 12:56.774
The lord.

12:56.894 --> 12:58.456
I see.

12:58.576 --> 13:00.293
And did you keep the receipt?

13:00.413 --> 13:02.514
(Chuckles)

13:03.515 --> 13:05.596
What?

13:17.085 --> 13:19.329
<i>(Tessa) It was easy to
imagine my life without Ryan.</i>

13:19.314 --> 13:20.737
<i>Too easy.</i>

13:20.745 --> 13:23.818
So should we go to the
Ingmar Bergman retrospective

13:23.834 --> 13:26.868
or check out the Matisse
exhibit at the Met?

13:26.876 --> 13:28.964
Let's do both.

13:29.434 --> 13:31.827
♪

13:32.124 --> 13:36.715
(Subway car clattering, whistle blows)

13:36.835 --> 13:38.271
<i>It was inevitable.</i>

13:38.271 --> 13:40.664
<i>Ryan and I were destined
for different things,</i>

13:40.698 --> 13:42.917
<i>and it was only a matter of time.</i>

13:42.968 --> 13:45.114
<i>But it wasn't that time.</i>

13:45.333 --> 13:47.238
<i>Not yet.</i>

13:49.923 --> 13:52.176
Ryan! (Sighs)

13:52.210 --> 13:53.677
I'm so glad to see you.

13:53.695 --> 13:55.015
Tessa, I don't wanna scare you off

13:55.054 --> 13:56.730
by bringing up the "L" word,

13:56.765 --> 13:59.269
so I'm just gonna say that... 

13:59.389 --> 14:01.107
I love you.

14:01.740 --> 14:04.517
I'm in love with you,
and I love loving you.

14:07.192 --> 14:09.260
Wait. Which "L" word
were you talking about?

14:09.294 --> 14:10.461
Leaving.

14:10.495 --> 14:12.408
For college.

14:12.806 --> 14:15.449
Crap! I wasn't... I wasn't
gonna say that word, but... 

14:15.484 --> 14:17.318
you don't have to worry.

14:17.352 --> 14:19.470
I'm not gonna do it.

14:19.504 --> 14:21.925
I'm not gonna let my
perfectly chiseled physique

14:21.957 --> 14:23.491
come between us.

14:23.881 --> 14:25.906
I'm gonna stay here in Chatswin
and I'm gonna get fat with you.

14:25.906 --> 14:26.719
No, Ryan,

14:26.735 --> 14:28.612
I can't let you jeopardize
everything you've worked for

14:28.628 --> 14:31.169
just because the two of us are dating.

14:31.289 --> 14:32.766
I already jeopardized it.

14:33.250 --> 14:35.917
I jeopardized the hell out
of it so we could be together.

14:36.037 --> 14:37.071
What does that mean?

14:37.105 --> 14:38.889
Ryan... 

14:39.343 --> 14:41.282
did you do something stupid?

14:41.845 --> 14:43.879
I think we both know the answer to that.

14:49.301 --> 14:52.469
(Sighs)

14:53.091 --> 14:55.756
Excuse me. We're looking
for a Fatima Smadja?

14:56.392 --> 14:57.666
Thank you.

14:57.786 --> 14:59.527
(Indistinct conversations)

14:59.561 --> 15:02.374
- Fatima?
- I'm on break.

15:02.600 --> 15:05.736
Uh, Fatima, I'm sorry,
but we have some sad news.

15:06.049 --> 15:08.615
I'm afraid it's Marty.

15:09.006 --> 15:10.593
He's passed away.

15:13.193 --> 15:14.327
Who?

15:14.629 --> 15:16.162
M-Marty?

15:16.196 --> 15:17.413
This old guy?

15:17.431 --> 15:19.081
Bald? Frowned a lot?

15:19.099 --> 15:21.317
Came in here every day
for the last 50 years?

15:21.351 --> 15:24.120
You just described 90% of my customers.

15:24.154 --> 15:26.946
Well, it must've been some other Smadja

15:26.954 --> 15:28.839
that was slingin' Marty's hash and eggs.

15:28.854 --> 15:31.091
Hash and eggs? Hash and eggs died?!

15:31.211 --> 15:33.867
Oh, no, not hash and eggs!

15:33.891 --> 15:36.323
Why, lord? Hash and eggs was a good man.

15:36.331 --> 15:38.951
I'm sorry. But the good news is,

15:38.982 --> 15:42.564
I am able to reunite you two lovebirds.

15:43.103 --> 15:45.989
Lovebirds?! What the
hell you talking about?

15:46.109 --> 15:48.406
Hash and eggs never spoke two words to me

15:48.397 --> 15:50.094
other than "check, please."

15:50.399 --> 15:52.222
But he bought this ticket for you.

15:52.206 --> 15:54.036
He wanted to travel with you.

15:54.156 --> 15:56.632
Oh. Well, he should've
made his move. (Laughs)

15:56.617 --> 15:59.769
I might've taken hash and eggs up on it.

16:00.050 --> 16:02.389
But now it's too late. He's dead.

16:02.420 --> 16:03.828
And the lunch rush... (Pats countertop)

16:03.820 --> 16:05.228
is about to start.

16:05.348 --> 16:06.557
Okay. Hold on.

16:06.799 --> 16:09.834
Is there a soup that we should know about?

16:10.029 --> 16:12.321
You know what? (Paper rustles)

16:12.765 --> 16:14.032
Here.

16:14.066 --> 16:16.278
I think Marty would've
wanted you to have these.

16:16.398 --> 16:19.195
I don't suppose you'd want
to take Marty with you?

16:19.471 --> 16:20.743
I would, but... 

16:20.863 --> 16:23.488
I feel like they might
give me trouble in customs.

16:23.608 --> 16:25.193
(Lowered voice) They probably will.

16:25.670 --> 16:28.432
W... wait, wait. At least let me say thanks.

16:34.403 --> 16:35.670
Mmm.

16:35.721 --> 16:37.089
Mmm!

16:37.081 --> 16:38.536
Mwah!

16:38.896 --> 16:40.640
<i>(Whispers) That was way... </i>

16:40.827 --> 16:43.178
way more erotic than it should've been.

16:43.212 --> 16:45.246
Okay. Well... 

16:45.998 --> 16:47.282
Good-bye, Fatima.

16:47.316 --> 16:49.601
Good-bye, hash and eggs. (Kisses)

16:51.126 --> 16:53.171
What a sad ending to a sad story.

16:53.189 --> 16:57.142
He really didn't have
anyone who cared about him.

16:57.176 --> 16:59.252
Yeah, he did.

17:00.112 --> 17:01.598
Yeah, he did.

17:02.294 --> 17:04.269
Who?

17:05.497 --> 17:06.240
<i>(Jarrison) Hello?</i>

17:06.219 --> 17:08.203
Oh, thank God! This is Tessa.

<i>Just kiddin' around, silly.</i>

17:09.618 --> 17:11.026

<i>I'll get back to you. (Beep)</i>

17:15.273 --> 17:16.439
Yes, hi.

17:16.559 --> 17:20.426
Uh, this Tessa Altman.
I'm Ryan Shay's girlfriend.

17:20.678 --> 17:24.531
And I know he asked you
to hobble him recently,

17:24.556 --> 17:26.034
but he's changed his mind.

17:26.041 --> 17:28.323
He would like to maintain
full use of his body,

17:28.357 --> 17:32.197
so please don't do
anything to jeopardize it.

17:32.705 --> 17:36.099
Copy that and call off the hit.

17:37.492 --> 17:39.760
(Beep) I think we're good.

17:40.143 --> 17:42.004
(Sighs) Okay. Good.

17:42.124 --> 17:42.888
(Sighs deeply)

17:42.919 --> 17:44.522
Oh, lord, please forgive me!

17:44.569 --> 17:46.696
Aah! Aah! Aah!

17:46.751 --> 17:48.847
(Gasps) Aah! Aah!

17:48.967 --> 17:50.693
(Inhales sharply)

17:50.967 --> 17:51.968
No, I'm good.

17:51.976 --> 17:53.109
(Laughing) Yeah.

17:53.649 --> 17:55.870
<i>It's really weird. It's
actually hurtin' my hand.</i>

17:55.893 --> 17:58.881
It's like, mm, really in pain, actually.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.254
(Sniffles) Mm.

18:00.288 --> 18:01.360
Well, uh, you two have a nice night,

18:01.368 --> 18:03.588
and I'm sorry I couldn't help
you out with your problem.

18:03.708 --> 18:07.435
Mm-hmm. I left you a message
saying that he changed his mind.

18:07.795 --> 18:09.164
Oh, I don't check my messages, sweetie.

18:09.148 --> 18:11.205
Well, you were right there in the bushes.

18:11.325 --> 18:14.161
You had to hear me leave the message saying

18:14.153 --> 18:15.780
he didn't want you to do it.

18:15.900 --> 18:17.727
I heard what now?

18:18.314 --> 18:19.949
Never mind.

18:20.069 --> 18:21.654
Will do.

18:21.774 --> 18:23.124
Oh, wait. Before I forget,

18:23.132 --> 18:25.767
next week, I'm running
a sale at the photo shop.

18:25.887 --> 18:29.717
All the wallet-sized prints
are gonna be half-off.

18:30.053 --> 18:31.813
Okay.

18:32.654 --> 18:34.339
You want a wallet-sized of me

18:34.394 --> 18:36.044
to look at while you're off at college?

18:36.067 --> 18:39.743
Mm, no. I want a life-sized of you.

18:39.778 --> 18:42.511
Well, you have one right here.

18:42.879 --> 18:44.013
Aah!

18:44.133 --> 18:45.783
Wow!

18:48.205 --> 18:49.018
Still good.

18:49.057 --> 18:50.293
- Oh, dang!
- Yeah.

18:50.316 --> 18:51.982
(Chuckles) I really didn't
wanna let you down, Ryan.

18:51.990 --> 18:54.758
We said we called it off.

18:54.793 --> 18:55.728
Hmm?

18:55.848 --> 18:57.903
Mm?

19:06.795 --> 19:07.858
What's this?

19:07.874 --> 19:10.228
I feel really bad that
I lied to you, Tessa,

19:10.212 --> 19:11.542
about where Ryan was,

19:11.597 --> 19:13.630
so I made you this apology cake.

19:14.005 --> 19:15.319
(Chuckles) Wow.

19:15.335 --> 19:17.384
Thanks. It looks delicious.

19:17.504 --> 19:19.932
Oh, it's not. My mom stopped
keeping sugar in the house,

19:19.932 --> 19:21.426
so I had to use cumin.

19:21.442 --> 19:22.670
Oh.

19:22.881 --> 19:25.289
So I guess I'm sorry about two things.

19:26.455 --> 19:30.200
Did you hear my clown
song at Marty's funeral?

19:30.320 --> 19:32.179
Uh, y... yeah.

19:32.226 --> 19:33.289
Thanks.

19:33.409 --> 19:35.706
It was partly about us.

19:37.505 --> 19:39.679
(Glasses clatter) I can't really see.

19:39.694 --> 19:42.111
Marty's death got me thinking, Evan.

19:42.231 --> 19:44.387
<i>And in this crazy, meshuggah world,</i>

19:44.379 --> 19:46.092

19:46.131 --> 19:48.688
<i>not to know your b'shert

19:48.808 --> 19:51.199
Dalia, did you learn yiddish for me?

19:51.319 --> 19:52.825
I don't care

19:52.802 --> 19:55.602
<i>if your abba has an aneurysm.</i>

19:56.179 --> 19:57.855
I want you.

19:59.238 --> 20:00.783
Bad.

20:06.746 --> 20:09.756
(Gasping)

20:11.551 --> 20:14.698
<i>(Whispers) You're so turned on right now.</i>

You know what? Let Marty be a lesson to us.

He knew what he wanted
and he went after it.

21:23.136 --> 21:24.730
No, you're right.

21:24.968 --> 21:27.620
You have to go after what you want in life.

21:27.677 --> 21:29.679
Otherwise, what's the point?

21:34.208 --> 21:36.166
I'm in love with Carmen.

What?!
