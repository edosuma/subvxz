01:52.738 --> 01:54.832
- I think I'll just...
- Okay.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.755
You've got the euros.

02:08.836 --> 02:10.884
I've got the euros, have I?

02:11.048 --> 02:13.142
Don't start.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.102
You never lose anything.

02:16.178 --> 02:18.476
I'll lose you in a minute.

02:22.434 --> 02:23.481
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

02:23.560 --> 02:27.315
<i>- you can now purchase metro tickets...</i>
- Thank you.

02:27.397 --> 02:30.321
<i>...from our buffet between
coaches six and 13,</i>

02:30.400 --> 02:33.574
<i>as well as a Paris pass giving you
access to museums and access to...</i>

02:33.654 --> 02:35.247
<i>Pardon, monsieur.</i>

02:35.322 --> 02:36.762
<i>We also sell discounted...</i>

02:45.666 --> 02:48.886
This is exactly what I needed.
Can't we have lunch immediately?

02:49.002 --> 02:51.846
- Are you starving?
- I'm practically dribbling.

02:51.922 --> 02:54.016
I like a man who knows
how to dribble.

03:04.476 --> 03:05.602
Rue Myrha.

03:05.686 --> 03:08.781
This is Chateau Rouge.
We've come out here.

03:10.816 --> 03:12.864
- Ah, Montmartre.
- Ah.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.241
Merci.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.949
Practically fluent.

03:18.323 --> 03:20.746
- I'm thinking in French now.
- You look French.

03:20.826 --> 03:22.078
Oh, <i>pardon.</i>

03:22.160 --> 03:23.833
- Oh, it was you.
- Oh, yeah.

03:25.747 --> 03:27.841
Spritely.

03:28.166 --> 03:31.045
Once you get in the rhythm,
you've got to keep going.

03:31.128 --> 03:33.051
You're just showing off now.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.729
Surely not.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.483
They've tarted it up a bit.

03:45.851 --> 03:47.899
They have?

03:57.654 --> 03:59.327
All right?

03:59.406 --> 04:00.953
Yep.

04:09.791 --> 04:12.715
I reckon if you stood on
tiptoe with a telescope,

04:12.794 --> 04:15.798
you could see the Hunchback
of Notre Dame's arse.

04:16.464 --> 04:18.559
It's, um.

04:20.135 --> 04:21.762
Beige.

04:24.181 --> 04:27.606
There's a certain
light-brownness about it, yes.

04:30.812 --> 04:31.938
Meg.

04:32.022 --> 04:34.070
Meg, don't do this, Meg.

04:36.985 --> 04:39.079
Last time,
when we were here before,

04:40.155 --> 04:43.955
it was bigger, plus grand, different
colour, <i>différente couleur.</i>

04:44.034 --> 04:46.833
So you recommend we
should redecorate?

04:46.912 --> 04:50.507
I can't do that.

04:53.877 --> 04:55.424
<i>Merde.</i>

04:56.213 --> 04:57.965
- Meg.
- Sorry, sir.

04:58.048 --> 05:01.018
How can you do...
How can you treat... Meg!

05:01.885 --> 05:03.137
Meg!

05:03.220 --> 05:05.018
- I'm really sorry, sir.
- Meg!

05:05.096 --> 05:06.518
- Taxi!
- Don't.

05:07.098 --> 05:09.817
- Taxi!
- We do have a complimentary breakfast

05:09.893 --> 05:11.645
- if you'd like to try...
- Wait! Wait!

05:11.770 --> 05:13.818
- Sir?
- Wait, wait, wait!

05:14.064 --> 05:16.112
We have croissants, sir.

05:16.191 --> 05:18.285
This was your idea.

05:18.360 --> 05:22.160
- How terrible to be in Paris.
- You want us to sleep in a coffin.

05:22.447 --> 05:24.541
- Give me the euros.
- What?

05:25.033 --> 05:26.660
Give me the euros.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.495
Wow.

05:31.623 --> 05:34.342
Oh, Meg. Stupid...

05:34.918 --> 05:37.171
Let's get started.

05:37.254 --> 05:39.256
Meg!

05:42.509 --> 05:44.227
Look, look, look!

05:51.142 --> 05:52.644
Ah. Paris.

05:58.233 --> 06:00.281
- Meg, stop it.
<i>- Merci.</i>

06:00.360 --> 06:01.828
Fuck's sake.

06:05.991 --> 06:09.370
What are we doing?
Why are we doing it? Where are we going?

06:09.452 --> 06:12.331
Why? What?
Ooh, what? We're in Paris!

06:12.414 --> 06:14.132
Yes, exactly.
Why don't we just stop and enjoy it?

06:14.207 --> 06:15.208
Just look!

06:31.349 --> 06:32.942
You'll need this.

06:33.018 --> 06:34.486
Okay.

06:34.561 --> 06:35.858
<i>Merci.</i>

06:35.937 --> 06:38.531
Meg! No! Please!

06:39.691 --> 06:41.534
<i>Bonjour.</i>

06:48.617 --> 06:52.042
No, no, no, no, no.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.168
<i>Non.</i>

07:06.718 --> 07:09.392
<i>Pardon. Monsieur, non, non.</i>

07:10.639 --> 07:12.061
Jesus.

07:14.976 --> 07:17.274
Meg? Meg!

07:21.107 --> 07:23.201
Whatever it costs is fine.

07:24.069 --> 07:26.071
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

07:26.154 --> 07:29.533
I'm so sorry, madame, but
unless you made a reservation,

07:29.616 --> 07:31.835
we are completely and utterly full.

07:31.910 --> 07:33.082
You see?

07:37.999 --> 07:40.172
They've taken our bags.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.475
- What now? Back on the train?
- Good idea.

07:48.843 --> 07:51.062
Get a taxi to the Gare du Nord.

07:51.763 --> 07:53.936
Sit in silence all the way
back to Moseley

07:54.015 --> 07:56.109
before killing ourselves
in a suicide pact.

07:56.184 --> 07:57.777
Perfect.

08:00.563 --> 08:02.816
I knew this trip would
be a fucking disaster.

08:02.899 --> 08:05.152
- You didn't even want to try.
- I did.

08:05.902 --> 08:08.246
But why did you book
that dreadful place?

08:08.321 --> 08:10.415
I was foolish enough
to want to try and please you.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.288
You actually said you
wanted to go back.

08:12.367 --> 08:13.835
- Not that far.
- Madame?

08:13.910 --> 08:15.503
- Anyway, it was the wrong place.
- It wasn't.

08:15.578 --> 08:16.750
It was.
it wasn't.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.457
They'd just redecorated.
That's all.

08:18.540 --> 08:21.134
Madame, there is one possibility.

08:23.211 --> 08:25.509
- There is?
- As a special offer,

08:25.588 --> 08:28.842
we have a prestige suite
available for two nights.

08:29.551 --> 08:32.270
In fact,
Tony Blair once slept there.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.894
Well?

08:37.100 --> 08:39.398
As long as they changed the sheets.

08:40.477 --> 08:42.105
Thank you.

08:45.567 --> 08:48.491
May I have your passports,
and a credit card, of course?

08:48.570 --> 08:50.743
Of course.
You've got the passports.

08:50.822 --> 08:52.244
Passports.

08:52.323 --> 08:53.996
Bang goes the bathroom.

08:54.075 --> 08:56.248
Just close your eyes
when you go in.

08:56.327 --> 08:58.921
My only remaining ambition
was to have a bidet.

08:58.997 --> 09:01.967
Well, I think we've
earned a very good time.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.594
You know I'm anxious about money.

09:05.336 --> 09:08.135
We might live for ages
as a burden to others.

09:08.214 --> 09:11.058
I've taken up Zumba.
I'm redesigning my body.

09:11.134 --> 09:13.637
Why?
Who's going to see it?

09:13.970 --> 09:15.062
Meg?

09:15.138 --> 09:17.232
- The keys, sir.
- Oh. Merci.

09:18.850 --> 09:20.898
- Anything else, sir?
<i>- Non, non.</i>

09:20.977 --> 09:23.071
Merci, ca va.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.608
Do you want me to
show you the room?

09:26.316 --> 09:29.365
No, no, it'll be all right. Thank you.
Merci, ca va, ca va.

09:29.444 --> 09:31.572
- Thank you, sir.
- <i>Merci.</i>

09:32.322 --> 09:34.416
Thank you, sir.

09:35.325 --> 09:37.748
See you later, no doubt.
<i>Au revoir.</i>

09:45.835 --> 09:49.009
On, my God!

09:49.089 --> 09:50.887
Oh!

09:54.094 --> 09:56.722
It really is wonderful.

09:57.847 --> 09:59.941
Quite spectacular.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.814
Time for some refreshment,
don't you think?

10:02.894 --> 10:04.237
Right.

10:21.663 --> 10:23.882
Meg, Meg, stop.
We're not that thirsty.

10:30.130 --> 10:33.009
So far this city is a brilliantly
designed machine

10:33.091 --> 10:35.389
for extracting all our money.

10:35.885 --> 10:37.137
What are you saying?

10:38.972 --> 10:40.189
What I'm saying is that

10:41.766 --> 10:46.272
we can't proceed with the bathroom until
you've made a decision about the tiles.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.362
What's that got to do with this?

10:51.109 --> 10:54.454
Well, I thought that now
we're in Paris together,

10:54.529 --> 10:56.372
we could discuss important things.

10:57.866 --> 10:58.958
Like tiles?

11:01.286 --> 11:02.663
It has to be done.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.088
Suppose I want you
to choose the tiles?

11:07.792 --> 11:09.009
Aren't you interested?

11:09.085 --> 11:11.964
I'm not sure I am, actually, no.

11:22.974 --> 11:25.068
Here's to us.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.272
- I love you.
- Lots of love, darling.

11:32.650 --> 11:33.697
Mmm.

11:39.157 --> 11:41.956
- Can I touch you?
- What for?

11:45.246 --> 11:46.748
This last five to ten years

11:46.831 --> 11:49.675
your vagina has become
something of a closed book.

11:49.751 --> 11:51.799
Now we've paid all this money,

11:51.878 --> 11:55.974
I'd rather see the Eiffel Tower
than your partially erect sausage.

11:56.799 --> 11:59.268
See both at the same time.
Wouldn't take a moment.

12:04.015 --> 12:07.144
I was thinking,

12:07.227 --> 12:10.572
we could try taking our lovemaking
into another dimension.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.652
What did you have in mind?

12:17.237 --> 12:20.286
I thought we could
pretend to be other people.

12:32.418 --> 12:35.137
A man who still wants
to make love to his wife.

12:35.755 --> 12:39.225
That's unusual,
if not a far-out perversion.

12:39.717 --> 12:41.890
I might do it for you later.

12:42.136 --> 12:44.434
- Really?
- If you stay awake.

12:55.316 --> 12:57.785
Last time we did this,
we could breathe.

13:03.032 --> 13:05.455
- Have your knees gone yet?
- Not yet.

13:07.245 --> 13:08.337
Nothing's gone yet.

13:23.344 --> 13:25.346
Who'd want to live
anywhere else?

13:27.098 --> 13:29.066
Let's do it.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.019
What?

13:31.102 --> 13:33.196
Sell up, get a
little apartment here.

13:34.022 --> 13:36.070
You'll find we'd still
have to earn money.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.320
Haven't we worked
for long enough?

13:41.446 --> 13:43.448
What else would we do?

13:44.615 --> 13:46.709
We could be artists.

13:47.076 --> 13:49.750
Nick, we're from Birmingham.

13:49.954 --> 13:51.922
Not by birth.

13:56.586 --> 13:59.180
- Hello.
<i>- Hi, Dad, it's me.</i>

13:59.255 --> 14:00.598
Hi, man!

14:00.673 --> 14:02.641
<i>Dad, are you at home?</i>

14:02.717 --> 14:04.719
No, we're on the continent.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.348
In France, in Paris.

14:09.932 --> 14:12.276
No, we haven't argued yet.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.650
Not at all, no.
It's wonderful.

14:15.813 --> 14:18.487
I'm falling in love with your
mother all over again.

14:20.568 --> 14:22.286
What?

14:22.653 --> 14:24.701
- Another one? Oh, fuck!
- Yeah, another one.

14:24.781 --> 14:26.624
- What's going on?
<i>- The place is teeming with them.</i>

14:26.699 --> 14:28.372
I'm going inside.

14:28.451 --> 14:30.954
- It's important.
<i>- Dad? Dad?</i>

14:31.037 --> 14:33.085
- It's a rat's nest.
<i>- Oh...</i>

14:33.164 --> 14:35.132
<i>And I don't know
what to do about it.</i>

14:35.208 --> 14:37.882
- Have you spoken to the estate agent?
- No, not yet.

14:37.960 --> 14:41.590
- You should, that's the first thing to do.
<i>- Think they'll be able to help?</i>

14:41.672 --> 14:42.764
Yeah.

14:49.305 --> 14:50.773
Hmm.

14:50.848 --> 14:52.850
Definitely not.

14:54.477 --> 14:56.479
Come on, Meg,
it's an emergency.

14:58.356 --> 15:02.281
How can you let them stay in a house
full of rats with a three-month-old baby?

15:02.360 --> 15:04.203
We just got rid of them.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.407
You know what she's like.

15:07.865 --> 15:10.960
She makes his life even more
intolerable than you make mine.

15:11.035 --> 15:13.834
You make my blood boil
like nobody else!

15:13.913 --> 15:15.961
That's the sign
of a deep connection.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.418
Meg! Meg!

15:18.501 --> 15:21.129
Do not mock or patronise me!

15:22.380 --> 15:24.098
Come on.

15:24.715 --> 15:26.717
He's our son.

15:28.636 --> 15:30.764
- Come on.
- Stop!

15:34.058 --> 15:36.186
Why won't you ever
let me touch you?

15:36.269 --> 15:39.694
It's not love.
It's like being arrested.

15:43.901 --> 15:45.903
I'm a phobic object for you.

15:50.992 --> 15:52.994
Kiss me now, then.

16:00.460 --> 16:01.882
Go on.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.342
God!

16:09.886 --> 16:11.046
That's us in ten years.

16:11.554 --> 16:14.057
- Is that the height of your ambition?
- Huh?

16:15.141 --> 16:16.661
- Ow!
- We're in Paris, give us a kiss.

16:16.726 --> 16:18.148
God!
What the fuck are you doing?

16:18.227 --> 16:19.524
Don't you like to be spanked?

16:19.604 --> 16:21.732
No! Don't you know me at all?

16:21.814 --> 16:23.407
Whoa! Ow!

16:23.483 --> 16:25.531
Oh, God, Nick!

16:25.610 --> 16:27.704
Nick, I'm sorry.

16:27.778 --> 16:31.078
- Sorry, are you okay?
- No, no, leave it. Leave it, it's my knee.

16:31.157 --> 16:33.251
Oh, come on, old fella.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.169
Take me to Casualty.
Stop it. Stop it!

16:35.244 --> 16:36.791
Don't be such a girl.

16:36.871 --> 16:40.626
No, really... It really hurts.

16:40.708 --> 16:43.587
Oh, God, Nick,
can't you be a man for once?

16:43.669 --> 16:45.922
- I'll leave you here.
- You do that. Go on.

16:46.255 --> 16:48.758
Jesus, God! Oh!

16:49.759 --> 16:51.557
Oh...

16:53.221 --> 16:54.973
Ah! Oh...

17:00.394 --> 17:02.021
It really hurts!

17:02.730 --> 17:04.949
I'm serious.

17:09.569 --> 17:11.742
It's not a terrible limp!

17:13.574 --> 17:14.951
Here?

17:15.701 --> 17:19.001
You choose lunch, I choose dinner.
Usual arrangement.

17:19.747 --> 17:21.875
How's your knee?

17:23.626 --> 17:25.753
Let's keep walking.

17:28.339 --> 17:29.807
Good boy.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.685
Too modern.

17:38.975 --> 17:40.773
Too empty.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.607
Too empty.

17:45.314 --> 17:47.157
Too touristy.

17:47.233 --> 17:49.235
And they've
got an English menu.

17:50.820 --> 17:53.243
- We have lift off.
- You sure?

17:53.739 --> 17:55.332
Good.

17:56.284 --> 18:00.084
<i>- Madame, monsieur, bonjour.
- Bonjour.</i>

18:00.162 --> 18:01.755
Bliss.

18:11.591 --> 18:14.140
<i>- Madame, monsieur, le menu.
- Merci.</i>

18:22.560 --> 18:24.028
<i>Merci.</i>

18:24.103 --> 18:27.607
I can't think when I've ever had
a harder decision to make.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.238
<i>Monsieur?</i>

18:30.318 --> 18:31.786
Madame.

18:42.830 --> 18:45.504
<i>Vivant.</i>

18:45.583 --> 18:47.506
Rosé.

18:56.927 --> 18:59.225
It's the nicest thing
I've ever put in my mouth.

19:08.356 --> 19:09.949
Listen.

19:10.608 --> 19:12.610
Thanks for bringing me.

19:15.112 --> 19:16.659
Try.

19:19.241 --> 19:20.538
Mmm!

19:26.165 --> 19:28.167
Oh, God.

19:31.253 --> 19:34.473
I was sceptical.
But I'm so glad we did this.

19:34.548 --> 19:36.550
Why sceptical?

19:37.009 --> 19:39.728
You've been attacking
me a lot, lately.

19:41.972 --> 19:43.440
Do you know why?

19:43.516 --> 19:44.984
DO you?

19:49.105 --> 19:51.073
You're making that noise.

19:51.941 --> 19:53.909
Am I?

19:53.984 --> 19:55.702
Have I always done it?

19:55.778 --> 19:57.121
Like an old horse at the trough.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.868
Enjoyment, some people call it.

20:03.786 --> 20:06.539
Lack of inhibition, freedom.

20:06.622 --> 20:09.216
Are you free?

20:10.084 --> 20:12.086
I'd love not to give a fuck.

20:15.131 --> 20:17.133
This is it, isn't it, my love?

20:18.384 --> 20:20.386
This is where I want to be forever.

20:21.178 --> 20:24.352
You always did edit out
the arguments and misery.

20:26.392 --> 20:29.111
You can't not love and
hate the same person.

20:29.979 --> 20:33.324
Usually within the space of
five minutes, in my experience.

20:33.858 --> 20:37.158
But you like things steady.

20:39.447 --> 20:41.541
Too steady.

20:43.659 --> 20:45.707
Why have you got your
constipated face on?

20:53.294 --> 20:55.296
The fact of the matter...

21:02.052 --> 21:03.429
Actually...

21:04.847 --> 21:06.849
What's happened...

21:08.392 --> 21:11.896
About a month ago, the college
insisted I take early retirement.

21:12.563 --> 21:14.782
Oh, Nick.

21:15.149 --> 21:16.776
Oh, fuck.

21:17.777 --> 21:20.075
One of the students
made an official complaint.

21:23.491 --> 21:24.743
What did you say?

21:24.825 --> 21:28.375
I said, "if you spent as much time on
your studies as you do on your hair,

21:28.454 --> 21:31.549
"you might have a chance of
escaping your background."

21:35.002 --> 21:36.754
She complained to the dean.

21:37.171 --> 21:41.267
Apparently her hair is her history,

21:41.634 --> 21:44.387
her identity.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.848
And something else, I forget what.

21:48.974 --> 21:51.022
Ah, <i>oui.</i>

21:51.101 --> 21:53.103
Yes, yes, we're finished.

21:58.692 --> 22:00.160
Why didn't you tell me before?

22:02.029 --> 22:04.327
I wanted it to be a surprise.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.705
I couldn't think about it.

22:18.420 --> 22:20.718
- It's just here.
- I hope it's dirty.

22:20.798 --> 22:22.516
I could do with cheering up.

22:22.591 --> 22:24.218
Definitely earthy.

22:25.094 --> 22:27.222
Is this it?

22:27.304 --> 22:28.806
Are you expecting me to die?

22:28.889 --> 22:31.813
Unfortunately, I'm expecting
you to live forever.

22:33.978 --> 22:38.484
Baudelaire, Soutine,
Sartre, Beckett...

22:39.650 --> 22:41.823
Your heroes.

22:41.902 --> 22:43.654
They're all here.

22:43.737 --> 22:47.082
But it's not as though
they're actually here, is it?

22:47.157 --> 22:49.000
Don't panic.

22:49.076 --> 22:51.078
It's only dust and bones.

22:51.161 --> 22:53.163
That's the problem.

22:53.956 --> 22:55.833
As Beckett says,

22:55.916 --> 22:58.044
"Do we mean love
when we say love?"

22:58.127 --> 23:00.846
What else do we mean?
That's stupid.

23:02.548 --> 23:06.143
I think he means there's more to
love than loving or being loved.

23:10.431 --> 23:13.184
Come on, where's Sartre?
This is fun!

23:15.978 --> 23:17.275
I was brilliant at school.

23:18.439 --> 23:20.862
Bit of a star at university.

23:22.234 --> 23:25.704
I have to say, I'm amazed by how
mediocre I've turned out to be.

23:26.322 --> 23:29.542
You can draw, you're musical.

23:30.576 --> 23:32.795
You can explain Wittgenstein
to the illiterate.

23:34.288 --> 23:38.543
You contrived to chuck them
away, your numerous talents.

23:38.959 --> 23:41.963
I did?
Why would I do that?

23:43.547 --> 23:44.548
Masochism?

23:46.133 --> 23:49.057
It's not too late for you
to find another direction.

23:50.387 --> 23:52.060
Why don't you think about it?

23:53.474 --> 23:54.851
Do you think so?

23:59.813 --> 24:01.281
People don't change.

24:02.232 --> 24:04.075
They do.

24:04.151 --> 24:05.528
They can get worse!

24:06.278 --> 24:08.656
Why have you
cheered up so much?

24:09.990 --> 24:12.334
What is wrong with you?

24:12.409 --> 24:14.252
Come on.

24:38.644 --> 24:40.646
Can you see anything there?

24:42.189 --> 24:45.284
- Have I got skin cancer?
- Yes.

24:45.985 --> 24:47.987
I knew it.

24:50.406 --> 24:54.582
You also mentioned early onset
Alzheimer's and stomach cancer.

24:54.660 --> 24:56.537
That's right.

24:56.620 --> 24:58.622
And a lazy eye.

25:01.709 --> 25:03.711
What else?

25:04.378 --> 25:07.552
You'll be sorry that you
never loved me enough.

25:15.514 --> 25:16.891
Mmm.

25:32.823 --> 25:34.825
<i>♪ Kidding you</i>

25:37.453 --> 25:41.083
<i>♪ You used to laugh about</i>

25:43.042 --> 25:46.763

25:47.087 --> 25:50.591

25:52.384 --> 25:55.763

26:14.656 --> 26:16.954

26:19.453 --> 26:22.206

26:24.750 --> 26:26.878
I've got the key.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.213
Hold on. Hold on.
Where are my keys?

26:30.631 --> 26:33.100
We're not at home.
Even you might have noticed.

26:33.175 --> 26:35.644
I get anxious if I don't
know where they are.

26:36.386 --> 26:40.607
I help you find things all the time,
even when it's futile and stupid.

26:40.682 --> 26:43.401
And don't use my toothbrush.
You'll give me gum disease.

26:43.477 --> 26:45.354
- That's not even yours.
- It bloody is!

26:45.646 --> 26:47.865
- The blue one.
-  Oh, yes.

26:47.940 --> 26:50.784
- Blue toothbrushes.
- It's a panda welcome.

26:50.859 --> 26:52.861
The welcoming committee.

26:53.654 --> 26:55.952
Why's that panda
staring at me?

26:56.782 --> 26:59.581
- I'm worried.
<i>- Bonjour, monsieur. Bonjour.</i>

27:00.327 --> 27:02.125
Catch me!

27:04.039 --> 27:05.382
Pardon.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.645
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

27:24.768 --> 27:26.816
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

27:42.578 --> 27:45.081
They'll take our last penny.

27:45.164 --> 27:48.213
If it's the end of the world,
I want to go down gulping oysters.

27:49.168 --> 27:51.296
Come on.

27:51.378 --> 27:53.472
I love it when you're in this mood!

27:53.922 --> 27:56.971
- Do you think you're bi-polar?
Tri-polar, possibly.

27:58.135 --> 27:59.728
Do you think that

27:59.803 --> 28:03.307
part of the reason you invited
Jack and Angie back into the house

28:03.390 --> 28:06.360
was because you can't bear
being alone with me?

28:08.562 --> 28:09.939
I can't bear to be apart from you.

28:10.939 --> 28:13.442
Well, you are
pathetically dependent.

28:15.277 --> 28:17.450
Why don't you want to
help young people?

28:17.529 --> 28:19.657
Shut up.

28:19.740 --> 28:21.162
Idiot!

28:23.577 --> 28:25.329
You're a fucking idiot, sometimes.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.052
I want a new start.

28:37.758 --> 28:39.226
Sorry?

28:41.386 --> 28:43.138
I wanted to tell you.

28:43.222 --> 28:45.566
I've gone as far as I
want to at the school.

28:45.849 --> 28:48.648
I'm fed up teaching Biology GCSE.

28:48.936 --> 28:51.109
I don't want to run the department.

28:52.439 --> 28:54.112
That's mad.
What would you do instead?

28:56.443 --> 28:58.571
I don't know.

28:59.905 --> 29:03.876
I want to learn Italian,
play the piano,

29:03.951 --> 29:05.953
dance the tango.

29:12.459 --> 29:14.632
Is it such a terrible idea?

29:18.340 --> 29:20.809
Once the kids have gone...

29:25.222 --> 29:27.224
What's left of us?

29:35.440 --> 29:38.364
You've picked our
anniversary to dump me?

29:39.903 --> 29:42.406
We must at least be
able to talk about it.

29:44.116 --> 29:45.743
Right?

29:47.035 --> 29:48.332
Of course.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.593
Come on, love.

29:55.669 --> 29:57.671
Let's enjoy our dinner.

30:11.101 --> 30:13.479
Come on.
Let's talk about the bathroom.

30:14.438 --> 30:16.440
I've got some good ideas.

30:21.153 --> 30:22.780
Nick?

30:31.788 --> 30:34.007
The least you can do
is buy me a last supper.

30:34.291 --> 30:35.292
My pleasure.

30:56.563 --> 30:58.531
Go outside and smoke.

30:58.607 --> 31:01.030
- I don't smoke.
- And wait.

31:02.569 --> 31:04.867
Get your coat.

31:04.946 --> 31:07.415
And get my coat too.

31:08.825 --> 31:11.123
That's all you have to do.

31:12.079 --> 31:13.831
Right.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.625
Fucking hell.

31:17.125 --> 31:18.672
Right.

31:23.090 --> 31:24.933
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>
My coat, please.

31:25.008 --> 31:26.100
Of course.

31:26.176 --> 31:27.849
ls everything
okay for you, madam?

31:27.928 --> 31:30.431
- Yes, great, thanks.
- Thank you.

31:49.574 --> 31:51.793
<i>Ah, excusez-moi.</i>

31:51.868 --> 31:53.870
Pardon.

32:46.465 --> 32:48.934
Nick!

32:49.009 --> 32:51.307
Nick! Over here!

32:57.851 --> 32:59.534
For Christ's sake,
what are you doing?

32:59.560 --> 33:01.631
Get this thing.
They've plastic on it.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.197
Come on!

33:03.273 --> 33:06.402
Come on,
give it a really good pull!

33:07.986 --> 33:09.579
Yes!

33:10.822 --> 33:11.869
Ah!

33:19.581 --> 33:22.084
God! Come on.

33:32.302 --> 33:34.396
Rock and fucking roll!

33:36.973 --> 33:38.566
Don't tell the kids.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.568
<i>Merci.</i>

33:42.103 --> 33:44.322
Come on. Come on.

33:45.023 --> 33:47.367
- Let's do it all again.
- What do you mean?

33:47.442 --> 33:50.491
Try me again and I promise
it'll be more fun this time.

33:59.079 --> 34:00.581
Get a room!

34:00.664 --> 34:02.837
Hey, Nick Burrows!

34:04.626 --> 34:07.470
It is. Nick Burrows?

34:07.671 --> 34:13.223
No. Is that really you, under all
that terribly un-English passion?

34:13.301 --> 34:15.770
My God! Good God, hello there!

34:15.844 --> 34:20.100
Yes, hi, how are you? How the damn
devil in the entire world are you?

34:20.350 --> 34:23.149
Tell me everything!

34:24.312 --> 34:27.565
- Wow!
- Great. Good.

34:27.774 --> 34:29.617
Um... Not bad.

34:29.693 --> 34:31.491
- Well, then, this is my wife, Meg.
- Hello.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.163
- Meg, Morgan. Morgan, Meg.
- Your wife?

34:33.237 --> 34:36.333
I've never seen a man
kiss his wife like that.

34:36.408 --> 34:39.411
Well, look at her.
She's so... She's so beautiful.

34:39.494 --> 34:43.465
May I... I gotta try a little of...
A little of that. Hello, Meg.

34:43.956 --> 34:46.880
Let's see.
Wow, that's just delightful!

34:46.960 --> 34:49.257
Well, what are the two of you
up to around here?

34:49.337 --> 34:51.385
The weekend, you know, in Paris.

34:51.464 --> 34:52.886
- Oh, really?
- For old times' sake.

34:52.966 --> 34:55.139
What about you?
I thought you lived in New York.

34:55.217 --> 34:57.016
Yeah. I know, I thought I did too.

34:57.094 --> 35:00.895
But I'm back here and I've got a
brand new wife, as a matter of fact.

35:00.974 --> 35:03.978
I'm scribbling and, you know,
prostituting myself as usual.

35:04.060 --> 35:06.563
Economics, politics,
the whole collapse.

35:06.646 --> 35:09.115
I understand it, apparently.
Who am I to disagree?

35:09.190 --> 35:11.158
Hey, listen...

35:11.234 --> 35:13.282
We're having a little
thing tomorrow.

35:13.361 --> 35:15.580
I'd love it if the two
of you could come along.

35:15.655 --> 35:17.095
- I don't know.
- I think we're free.

35:17.157 --> 35:19.080
You are?
That's great. May I?

35:19.159 --> 35:21.833
May I write a little something?

35:21.911 --> 35:23.879
Seriously, Nick,
this must be synchronicity.

35:23.955 --> 35:27.300
We gotta catch up on so many things.
Thank you, Meg.

35:27.375 --> 35:29.298
Mmm.
There's so much to talk about.

35:29.377 --> 35:30.503
There is?

35:30.587 --> 35:31.839
- Thanks.
- Eight o'clock.

35:31.921 --> 35:34.765
You can be unfashionably on
time for once in your life.

35:36.301 --> 35:37.928
Wow!

35:38.303 --> 35:40.021
Tomorrow.

35:40.096 --> 35:42.269
Tomorrow, oh, my God!

35:42.349 --> 35:45.444
Nick... Burrows!

35:49.939 --> 35:52.408
Rue de Rivoli. Wow!

35:53.401 --> 35:55.779
We were at Cambridge together.

35:55.862 --> 35:58.331
Haven't you got his
book by the bed?

35:58.573 --> 35:59.699
Possibly.

35:59.783 --> 36:02.411
You read it twice and said it was
a bad day for the English language.

36:02.494 --> 36:04.997
It was very well received.
It was a sensation.

36:08.041 --> 36:10.043
He was in the year below me.

36:10.126 --> 36:11.969
I introduced him to everybody.

36:12.796 --> 36:14.969
What happened?

36:15.382 --> 36:17.009
Life happened.

36:20.303 --> 36:21.976
That's mine.

36:24.015 --> 36:25.642
- Give it to me!
- No.

36:27.477 --> 36:29.696
You're gonna
get gum disease!

36:29.771 --> 36:32.240
Yeah, I'll give you gum disease.

36:32.691 --> 36:34.864
- Ow!
- Give it to me!

36:35.860 --> 36:37.487
Oh, sorry.

36:42.659 --> 36:44.161
Blood.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.168
Show me your breasts.

37:35.754 --> 37:37.973
Are you sleeping?

37:38.548 --> 37:40.676
Awaiting your noises.

37:43.803 --> 37:46.397
What are you thinking?

37:48.767 --> 37:53.273
Should I have had the creme brulée
instead of the poires belle Hélene?

37:54.314 --> 37:56.692
It'll be my dying thought.

38:01.321 --> 38:03.824
- Would it be okay...
- Mmm?

38:04.365 --> 38:07.710
...for me to briefly mount you...

38:07.827 --> 38:08.874
Mmm-hmm.

38:08.953 --> 38:13.174
...and soon after ejaculate
a miniscule amount?

38:14.542 --> 38:16.795
I'm dropping off.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.175
Nick?

39:35.415 --> 39:36.712
Nick?

39:45.758 --> 39:47.226
Nick?

40:21.920 --> 40:24.423
What is it?
What's happened?

40:24.756 --> 40:25.973
I thought you'd gone.

40:27.342 --> 40:29.470
Wasn't that what you wanted?

40:31.554 --> 40:32.726
Hold me.

40:35.058 --> 40:37.607
I've got you, darling.
I've got you.

40:38.019 --> 40:40.260
- I thought you'd gone.
- It's all right, it's all right.

40:40.313 --> 40:42.691
I've got you. I've got you.

40:46.486 --> 40:48.955
I never read short
stories in the papers at home.

40:54.869 --> 40:55.870
It's good.

40:59.415 --> 41:01.588
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour, madame.

41:02.877 --> 41:04.629
Over here?

41:11.135 --> 41:13.979
You know,
Morgan seems to really like you.

41:15.390 --> 41:18.064
He wasn't joking.
He really does want to see you.

41:20.645 --> 41:21.988
Why?

41:22.647 --> 41:24.945
What have I got that he
could possibly want?

41:25.024 --> 41:27.026
Me, for a start.

41:29.862 --> 41:32.706
- Oh.
- Couldn't he help you?

41:36.661 --> 41:38.880
- I like your collage.
- You do?

41:38.955 --> 41:41.458
Yeah, it looks great.

41:41.541 --> 41:43.635
- You look great.
- Thanks.

41:43.710 --> 41:46.133
You've always
had elegance and grace.

41:46.212 --> 41:47.589
You've always had class.

41:47.672 --> 41:49.094
Thank you!

41:50.633 --> 41:52.101
Well?

41:52.760 --> 41:54.762
Well... Thanks.

41:55.263 --> 41:57.982
- What about me?
- What about you, what?

41:58.641 --> 42:01.485
Have I got class?

42:01.561 --> 42:02.653
What?

42:02.729 --> 42:04.982
I want to do the ultimate
Cambridge novel.

42:05.064 --> 42:06.407
God!

42:06.482 --> 42:08.234
Beginning in the '70s.

42:08.317 --> 42:12.038
Orgies, drugs, work, kids,

42:12.113 --> 42:13.660
divorce,

42:13.740 --> 42:16.334
multiple sclerosis,

42:16.409 --> 42:18.457
assisted death...

42:18.536 --> 42:20.880
I'd rather stick
pins in my breasts.

42:20.955 --> 42:23.003
Haven't you got any
less tired ideas?

42:24.167 --> 42:25.794
Don't put me down.

42:25.877 --> 42:28.801
Mistress Realism, you used
to call me. You liked that.

42:28.880 --> 42:30.302
Up to a point.

42:48.024 --> 42:49.492
What are you doing?

42:50.276 --> 42:52.404
Come on.
Take what you want.

42:53.196 --> 42:54.994
You can cut out the pictures.

42:55.073 --> 42:57.201
I'll pay.

43:10.379 --> 43:12.302
Be kind, don't look.

43:13.591 --> 43:17.721
Every time I take off my knickers,
I think there's going to be an eclipse.

43:17.804 --> 43:20.057
I love to look at you.

43:21.265 --> 43:24.485
Slightly chubby in
places now. Voluptuous.

43:24.560 --> 43:28.110
I don't want to be fucking
chubby in places. Any places.

43:29.899 --> 43:31.822
I thought you'd like
to be appreciated.

43:31.901 --> 43:33.699
Well, I am.

43:34.987 --> 43:38.161
The other day, I'll have
you know, a young man,

43:38.241 --> 43:40.243
not entirely retarded,

43:40.326 --> 43:42.920
tried to pick me up in Waterstones.

43:44.163 --> 43:47.042
Doesn't surprise me.
You're hot.

43:47.750 --> 43:49.468
Thank you.

43:50.336 --> 43:52.213
Hot but cold.

43:54.006 --> 43:56.600
Our generation was
into weird living:

43:58.010 --> 44:00.934
Communes,

44:01.013 --> 44:03.311
vegetarianism,

44:03.391 --> 44:05.268
lesbianism.

44:06.894 --> 44:09.443
Nothing straight where possible.

44:10.231 --> 44:13.906
But I'm glad we got married. That's why
I wanted to celebrate this weekend.

44:15.319 --> 44:17.742
It's the commitment...

44:17.822 --> 44:20.917
The sacrifice of other
pleasures that makes it work.

44:21.450 --> 44:23.293
You're terrified.

44:25.454 --> 44:27.752
- Of what?
- Being left alone.

44:27.832 --> 44:31.382
You follow me round the house
like a child with a popped balloon.

44:31.752 --> 44:35.802
You really are becoming more
self-obsessed, Nick. It's getting worse.

44:35.882 --> 44:38.681
Some people brag about
their ability to be alone.

44:41.721 --> 44:45.817
But I've started to feel a sort
of physical dread of desertion.

44:45.892 --> 44:47.894
Oh, come on!

44:48.477 --> 44:51.401
Why doesn't anybody
want my company?

45:07.538 --> 45:09.586
Do you like the shoes?

45:12.001 --> 45:14.220
Do I please you, monsieur?

45:16.464 --> 45:19.138
Tell me who you bought
those shoes for.

45:19.717 --> 45:21.560
What do you mean?
You know who.

45:23.763 --> 45:25.185
Who, for me?

45:26.307 --> 45:28.605
For you?
For me, you idiot.

45:32.355 --> 45:34.323
I've decided to give
up everything I like.

45:34.899 --> 45:36.867
- Why?
- It's a discipline,

45:36.943 --> 45:38.866
the only advantage of masochism.

45:38.945 --> 45:41.869
I want to stop desiring
things which are impossible.

45:45.910 --> 45:47.036
You won't like this, then.

45:48.746 --> 45:49.747
What?

45:53.751 --> 45:54.752
What?

45:59.548 --> 46:00.595
Get down.

46:26.033 --> 46:27.125
Look.

46:34.667 --> 46:36.169
Can you see?

46:51.350 --> 46:53.273
Let me smell you.

46:57.982 --> 47:00.656
Please... Just a sniff.

47:05.239 --> 47:06.707
You're a naughty dog.

47:11.078 --> 47:13.080
Get ready while I put my dress on.

47:21.964 --> 47:24.592
Haven't got any...
Anything to get ready in.

47:26.677 --> 47:29.271
Stay here, then,
and write your masterpiece.

47:36.520 --> 47:38.522
Just leave it, like Jack does.

47:39.774 --> 47:42.277
I wouldn't rely on him in
matters of the head.

47:42.568 --> 47:44.161
You envied him.

47:44.737 --> 47:47.035
You made sure he had
more of you than I did.

47:47.114 --> 47:50.038
He was the child.
Now you want him back in the house.

47:50.618 --> 47:52.245
You can't let anyone go.

47:53.079 --> 47:55.173
I haven't seen this since
I read Gramsci

47:55.247 --> 47:58.046
and contemplated kidnapping
a captain of industry.

48:21.440 --> 48:23.442
<i>This is the last time
I save you.</i>

48:24.985 --> 48:26.237
What?

48:29.281 --> 48:30.783
On the room, madame?

48:30.866 --> 48:33.210
Always on the room.
It's my new mantra.

48:33.452 --> 48:34.920
"On the room."

48:36.622 --> 48:38.090
Everything on the room.

48:49.844 --> 48:55.726
I think I'm gonna ask Morgan to help you
get your philosophy book published.

48:56.559 --> 48:58.061
I'm not ready to start that.

49:00.604 --> 49:02.277
What's so amusing?

49:03.232 --> 49:09.114
You are always about to write a book
or about to decorate the bathroom

49:09.196 --> 49:14.293
or about to tell me something
which will alter our lives forever.

49:15.161 --> 49:17.129
But you know what you are?

49:17.204 --> 49:19.172
A potential Nobel laureate?

49:19.748 --> 49:22.968
You are the postman
who never knocks.

49:23.627 --> 49:25.595
And you know why that is?

49:25.671 --> 49:29.266
Please, darling, lighten
my burden of ignorance.

49:29.341 --> 49:31.343
I'm not sure you've got any balls.

49:34.096 --> 49:36.895
When we met,
you were part of the feminist Taliban

49:36.974 --> 49:39.602
and you insisted I
contact my feminine side.

49:39.685 --> 49:41.608
Have I not contacted
it sufficiently?

49:41.687 --> 49:43.030
Contacted it?

49:43.105 --> 49:45.107
You practically married it.

49:50.988 --> 49:54.868
Perhaps one day I'll
be as tall and manly

49:55.576 --> 49:58.580
and as nifty with
Microsoft Word as Melik.

49:59.455 --> 50:00.581
Melik.

50:05.127 --> 50:07.255
The computer guy? Melik?

50:07.338 --> 50:08.681
Yes, Melik.

50:10.132 --> 50:12.726
Well? Are you going to admit it?

50:13.844 --> 50:15.096
Admit what?

50:16.055 --> 50:17.147
Your lover.

50:21.143 --> 50:23.191
Yes?

50:27.816 --> 50:29.693
That kid?

50:30.277 --> 50:34.248
That bald, sweaty nerd
in a badly-fitting T-shirt?

50:34.323 --> 50:35.950
Are you having a nervous breakdown?

50:36.033 --> 50:37.159
Admit it.

50:37.243 --> 50:40.203
How many times do you expect me to
believe your bloody laptop can go wrong?

50:40.204 --> 50:41.581
Admit it!

50:45.793 --> 50:48.216
You're ill!

50:59.139 --> 51:01.562
I saw how you were with him.
Tell me the truth.

51:01.642 --> 51:04.111
You're an idiot.
I've had enough of you.

51:04.478 --> 51:06.901
Meg, tell me the truth.

51:06.981 --> 51:10.155
Have I ever lied to you? Ever?

51:11.443 --> 51:13.366
What on earth was I thinking of,

51:13.445 --> 51:17.700
depriving myself of love, of sex,
of male company,

51:17.783 --> 51:19.456
to keep this pathetic thing going?

51:19.535 --> 51:21.378
I thought you were interested
in someone else.

51:21.453 --> 51:25.003
- It's me I want more of!
- Why? What for?

51:25.082 --> 51:27.460
- I want to sell the house.
- What?

51:27.543 --> 51:29.386
I'm to be thrown out
of my own home?

51:29.461 --> 51:31.964
- Get a flat.
- I don't have an income.

51:32.339 --> 51:34.558
Divorce happens
to everyone now.

51:35.718 --> 51:37.470
You went with a student!

51:37.553 --> 51:40.227
Fifteen years ago. How could
you bring that up now?

51:40.306 --> 51:42.400
Just as Jack was having
all those problems at school,

51:42.474 --> 51:46.695
all you said was, "He'll be fine."
I was out of my mind with worry.

51:47.104 --> 51:49.573
You couldn't believe that
any child of yours

51:49.648 --> 51:52.322
could possibly have
anything wrong with him.

51:52.401 --> 51:54.870
I was isolated.
You preferred the boys to me.

51:54.945 --> 51:56.447
Do you blame me?

51:57.364 --> 51:59.492
Meg. Meg...

52:00.034 --> 52:02.913
If we go in there, our lives will
never be the same again.

52:02.995 --> 52:06.124
Great! Let's hurry,
let's open the door.

52:07.791 --> 52:11.216
In fact, why don't you stay out here
whingeing and complaining as usual?

52:11.295 --> 52:13.718
I actually want to go to a party.

52:13.797 --> 52:15.549
Come on, Meg!

52:16.008 --> 52:17.351
Meg, please.

52:18.719 --> 52:20.767
Fucking apologise!

52:22.097 --> 52:23.895
Why should I?

52:23.974 --> 52:27.945
You dressed up for him. You took him tea.
You hung around wearing that scent.

52:31.023 --> 52:32.696
I love you, Meg.

52:33.734 --> 52:35.327
Take that seriously.

52:38.656 --> 52:40.374
Love dies.

52:40.449 --> 52:41.917
Only if you kill it.

52:41.992 --> 52:44.495
- Fool, you really are.
- Call me paranoid.

52:44.578 --> 52:46.751
You are, you must be.
Melik!

52:46.830 --> 52:48.503
Cold, you.
You're frozen inside.

52:48.582 --> 52:49.925
Frankly, you'd freeze a penguin.

52:50.000 --> 52:51.752
- Ha, ha. That's not fuckin' funny.
- You're weak.

52:51.835 --> 52:55.089
You won't even get through this
evening without a nervous breakdown.

52:55.172 --> 52:57.300
- Welcome!
- Ah!

52:57.383 --> 52:59.852
Thank goodness, you made it.
That's so wonderful.

53:00.469 --> 53:02.392
- Ah! There we are.
- Hi.

53:02.471 --> 53:04.189
Not far to go.
Good evening.

53:04.264 --> 53:06.312
Welcome. Here, would you
like some champagne?

53:06.392 --> 53:08.394
- Thank you.
- Please. Come on in, come on in.

53:08.477 --> 53:10.605
I was worried you guys
weren't gonna make it.

53:10.688 --> 53:12.565
I almost had a thrombo.
Come on, come on.

53:12.648 --> 53:14.241
There are some great
people in here,

53:14.316 --> 53:15.943
and they're dying to meet you.
I've been talking you up.

53:16.026 --> 53:17.243
Thank you, Stéphane.

53:17.319 --> 53:18.759
I've been thinking
about you all day.

53:18.779 --> 53:19.826
You have?

53:21.031 --> 53:23.125
What gorgeous hell is this?

53:23.200 --> 53:24.827
<i>- Merci.
- Merci.</i>

53:25.744 --> 53:27.371
Go on, go in.

53:27.454 --> 53:29.957
They're French. I'm sure
their lives are awful too.

53:30.290 --> 53:31.792
Don't leave me on my own.

53:31.875 --> 53:33.673
Isn't that what you want?

53:34.336 --> 53:35.588
There we are.

53:35.671 --> 53:37.344
Thought I'd lost you.
Come on in.

53:37.423 --> 53:39.801
I didn't see... Oh, look at that.
Come on in, I'll introduce you.

53:39.883 --> 53:43.808
I didn't see that black lacy...
I wish I had my sketch pad.

53:44.388 --> 53:48.063
May I introduce you
to all these talkative types?

53:48.142 --> 53:51.487
Hey, this is, uh, Nick, everybody.

53:51.562 --> 53:55.112
Well, here's Robert and Dominique
Ertel, my long-suffering publishers.

53:55.190 --> 53:56.737
They do all my stuff
here in France.

53:56.817 --> 54:01.448
This is my great old friend,
Nick Burrows, and his wife, Meg.

54:01.530 --> 54:04.409
They're from London.
He's a professor of philosophy.

54:04.491 --> 54:08.371
Meg, I'm so sorry, I didn't ask you.
Tell me what you do.

54:08.454 --> 54:10.172
- Writer?
- I'm a teacher.

54:10.247 --> 54:11.999
That's so interesting.
I wanna hear all about that.

54:12.082 --> 54:15.177
Jean-Pierre.
May I introduce our expert on Proust?

54:15.252 --> 54:17.095
- He's exaggerating.
- Not true.

54:17.171 --> 54:20.266
He's so good. And you're
currently translating Dickens.

54:20.340 --> 54:21.887
<i>Yeah. Bleak House.</i>

54:21.967 --> 54:23.890
- Oh!
<i>- Bleak House.</i>

54:23.969 --> 54:27.439
Oh, yeah. Victoire Lachapelle,
the novelist, I'm sure you know,

54:27.514 --> 54:30.267
Américain, very successful...

54:31.101 --> 54:33.069
And Harry Rose, the sculptor,

54:33.145 --> 54:35.239
who's got a very interesting
show of drawings.

54:35.314 --> 54:38.363
- Where is that gallery?
- Think and Do Gallery, St Honoré.

54:38.442 --> 54:40.911
I saw it, it's fantastic.
I highly recommend it.

54:40.986 --> 54:43.660
- Christophe Aragues.
- Ara-gueth.

54:43.739 --> 54:44.991
Ara-gueth.

54:45.073 --> 54:47.872
He's a professor of
economics at the Sorbonne.

54:47.951 --> 54:51.626
And Valentin Lefevre, who's an
economist at <i>Le Monde.</i>

54:51.705 --> 54:53.048
<i>Financial Times.</i>

54:53.123 --> 54:56.844
<i>The Financial Times.
Perhaps you've run into his stuff.</i>

54:56.919 --> 55:01.049
And the Mona Lisa over there,
can you see, is my wife Eve.

55:01.131 --> 55:04.761
Hello, my darling.
Nick Burrows and Meg.

55:05.886 --> 55:06.887
Thank you.

55:06.970 --> 55:09.974
So there you go.
Hey, come with me, Nick.

55:10.057 --> 55:12.606
Can I steal your sweet husband away
for a sec?

55:12.684 --> 55:14.903
- Take him, do.
- What are you gonna say?

55:14.978 --> 55:16.104
Yeah, right.

55:16.188 --> 55:20.113
There you go. Okay.

55:30.327 --> 55:32.295
There you go.

55:32.371 --> 55:33.839
There you go, Nick.

55:34.456 --> 55:36.959
Oh, if I may.

55:37.251 --> 55:39.970
Thanks. Can't wait to read it.

55:40.254 --> 55:44.134
Oh, well, you know, it's actually
just a rehash of my old articles.

55:44.216 --> 55:48.221
But, you know, they put it into this book
and it took off for some reason.

55:48.303 --> 55:51.147
I got lucky, I guess.
It could happen to anybody.

55:51.223 --> 55:54.898
- It didn't happen to me.
- Well, you're too serious.

55:54.977 --> 55:58.777
You know, have you ever even said
anything slight in your whole life?

55:58.856 --> 56:02.110
I don't think so, not in the time
that I knew you. Here have a...

56:02.192 --> 56:04.069
Please have a seat.

56:04.653 --> 56:08.283
Over the years that I've sat in desks
like this and, you know,

56:08.365 --> 56:11.869
in those times when I've tried to
convince myself I had some kind of brain

56:11.952 --> 56:16.879
or just a little bit of
rigour and integrity,

56:16.957 --> 56:19.380
you know what I've thought
so often to myself?

56:19.459 --> 56:21.302
"What would Nick Burrows do now?

56:23.213 --> 56:24.965
"What would Nick say now?"

56:26.592 --> 56:28.060
- You have?
- Yes.

56:28.552 --> 56:30.552
Thank you so much.
Would you like something to eat?

56:30.971 --> 56:33.599
- No, merci.
- Are you sure? Thank you.

56:33.974 --> 56:35.692
Thank you. Is it, Ju...

56:35.767 --> 56:38.270
- Julie.
- Julie?

56:38.687 --> 56:40.314
Thank you, Julie.

56:44.818 --> 56:45.944
Eve.

56:46.945 --> 56:48.947
She's gonna eat me alive.

56:50.240 --> 56:52.413
You know, I'm not...
I'm not a total idiot.

56:53.452 --> 56:54.453
But...

56:54.536 --> 57:00.009
Nick, I was so depressed and I was
just suffocating and I was dying.

57:00.500 --> 57:03.629
I was seeing every psychiatrist
on the Upper West Side.

57:04.630 --> 57:09.557
Until I finally found one who, of course,
told me what I wanted to hear

57:10.177 --> 57:12.350
and he released me

57:13.305 --> 57:16.058
and I slipped away from
my wife one morning

57:16.141 --> 57:18.109
without even taking my toothbrush.

57:19.061 --> 57:22.156
It was totally insane.
And I wound up here.

57:22.230 --> 57:26.155
But then, I decided to do the
whole thing all over again.

57:26.234 --> 57:28.578
Love, marriage and kids.

57:28.654 --> 57:31.624
And so now here I am...

57:32.574 --> 57:33.575
Mmm.

57:33.867 --> 57:35.790
Enjoying...

57:36.536 --> 57:39.380
Keeping the Mona Lisa fascinated.

57:40.457 --> 57:41.629
And she adores me.

57:42.459 --> 57:44.632
Can't see through me... Yet.

57:44.878 --> 57:46.380
But we know she will.

57:47.130 --> 57:48.723
I mean, she will.

57:50.926 --> 57:54.726
So am I brave or am I foolish?

57:55.973 --> 57:58.476
Why would you put yourself
through all that again?

58:01.770 --> 58:03.568
Because I'm vain.

58:03.647 --> 58:06.651
Because I'm just ridiculously vain.

58:06.733 --> 58:10.863
I wanna be adored and waited for

58:11.530 --> 58:12.998
and listened to.

58:13.782 --> 58:14.999
Don't you?

58:16.368 --> 58:17.961
I don't share your delusion.

58:19.663 --> 58:22.086
What do you mean, delusion?
How am I deluded?

58:24.710 --> 58:27.054
That by giving up on
someone, you're free.

58:30.966 --> 58:32.809
No, no, no.

58:33.260 --> 58:34.853
No, no. Mmm.

58:36.054 --> 58:37.351
Mmm!

58:38.098 --> 58:40.021
Do you know what I
just flashed on?

58:40.100 --> 58:42.319
Do you remember
those mornings at dawn

58:42.728 --> 58:48.701
that we would get up to sell those
newspapers in front of the factory gates?

58:48.775 --> 58:52.905
I think we sold about four of them before
the working-class heroes chased us away.

58:54.156 --> 58:56.784
I'll bet those factories
aren't even there any more.

58:57.117 --> 58:59.370
How about the Brecht play,

58:59.453 --> 59:02.957
that you put on at the ADC
with the Pink Floyd music?

59:03.040 --> 59:05.213
Very brilliant. Very brilliant.

59:06.293 --> 59:07.715
Were those the days?

59:10.338 --> 59:11.555
Oh!

59:12.340 --> 59:13.512
Wow!

59:14.676 --> 59:17.771
I mean, we grew up so safe
and easy, that's the truth.

59:18.513 --> 59:22.814
You know, it's been just
a breeze for guys like us.

59:22.893 --> 59:25.487
- It has?
- Well, look at you, you know.

59:26.021 --> 59:29.025
Sitting comfortably in some
15th-century room,

59:29.608 --> 59:33.784
with your spectacularly
striking, beautiful wife.

59:34.196 --> 59:38.246
A weekend cottage ¡n the
Cotswolds, I'll bet, and a Labrador,

59:40.160 --> 59:43.209
the royalties from all your books and
a big pension at the end of all of it.

59:43.288 --> 59:45.165
Am I getting my serve
in the ballpark?

59:45.248 --> 59:48.752
And you've got smart, bearded friends
with whom you can discuss politics

59:48.835 --> 59:52.135
and philosophy while you all sing
along to Joni Mitchell records?

59:52.214 --> 59:54.416
- You see me more clearly
than I see myself.

59:55.383 --> 59:59.388
I can... You know,
I can do a little thing.

59:59.471 --> 01:00:00.597
You know...

01:00:01.556 --> 01:00:04.480
I think we've taken
too much out of the world.

01:00:05.143 --> 01:00:08.522
We were the spark. The '60s
and '70s lit the fuse, baby.

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:09.697
Really?

01:00:10.315 --> 01:00:13.489
Yeah. Feminism, racial equality,
human rights, all that stuff.

01:00:14.361 --> 01:00:17.991
Yeah, I wanna ignite
some kind of blaze, you know.

01:00:18.073 --> 01:00:22.374
I wanna go into the banlieues with
some good people and some money

01:00:22.869 --> 01:00:27.124
and, you know, have discussions,
political, literary, but shake things up.

01:00:27.207 --> 01:00:29.005
Do you wanna come with me?

01:00:29.084 --> 01:00:30.427
Me?

01:00:30.502 --> 01:00:34.848
I could put you down for, you know, 2K.
Neither of us'll miss that kind of money.

01:00:37.175 --> 01:00:38.643
Make it four.

01:00:38.718 --> 01:00:41.767
Make it 4K, I'll put a cheque
in the post tomorrow.

01:00:43.265 --> 01:00:44.608
Nick Burrows.

01:00:46.101 --> 01:00:47.523
I knew you'd get it.

01:00:48.979 --> 01:00:50.947
Oh, I knew it.

01:00:53.275 --> 01:00:54.902
Here's to the future.

01:01:07.622 --> 01:01:09.750
- Are you an artist?
- I wish.

01:01:10.834 --> 01:01:12.836
Well, you...
You look like an artist.

01:01:14.254 --> 01:01:17.133
Perhaps it's your hair.

01:01:23.221 --> 01:01:25.599
So, what are you doing here?

01:01:26.266 --> 01:01:28.143
Yes, that's a good question.

01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:31.108
No, I mean,
what are you doing here in Paris?

01:01:31.188 --> 01:01:33.407
Oh, it's our wedding anniversary.

01:01:33.481 --> 01:01:36.655
Really?
Wow, how long?

01:01:37.736 --> 01:01:40.410
- Thirty years.
- That's amazing.

01:01:40.488 --> 01:01:42.081
Yes, it is, isn't it?

01:01:42.157 --> 01:01:45.252
Our children have left home.
Nearly.

01:01:45.744 --> 01:01:47.371
So now, we're alone together.

01:01:47.454 --> 01:01:49.798
And now you will have
time just for each other.

01:01:49.873 --> 01:01:51.466
Mmm.

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:55.212
I know it's awful.

01:01:57.047 --> 01:02:00.802
I can't wait to be with him
every minute of the day.

01:02:01.843 --> 01:02:04.767
He knows everything.
I will never be bored by him.

01:02:04.846 --> 01:02:06.848
Suppose he's bored by you?

01:02:08.391 --> 01:02:10.393
Really? You think?

01:02:10.477 --> 01:02:12.320
I don't believe in that.

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:13.521
"The one."

01:02:14.022 --> 01:02:17.196
There are many ones.
That's the problem.

01:02:17.275 --> 01:02:20.199
People start to murder you.
You have to be ruthless.

01:02:22.822 --> 01:02:25.200
My husband claimed
I was unfaithful.

01:02:25.367 --> 01:02:26.664
And what did you say?

01:02:29.537 --> 01:02:31.084
I thought,

01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:33.508
"What a waste.

01:02:34.167 --> 01:02:38.513
"To be accused of being a
whore and to be so innocent."

01:02:42.842 --> 01:02:44.310
I'm sorry.

01:02:44.386 --> 01:02:46.559
When's the baby due?

01:02:46.638 --> 01:02:48.732
Oh, it's for April.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.448
Sorry.

01:03:42.527 --> 01:03:44.029
Who are you?

01:03:44.112 --> 01:03:46.114
Nick. I'm Nick.

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:52.662
Do you like that music?

01:03:54.372 --> 01:03:57.251
Uh... I like all music.

01:03:58.501 --> 01:03:59.753
I give it a go.

01:04:01.171 --> 01:04:03.265
Good for you.

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:04.432
Do you want a drink?

01:04:12.891 --> 01:04:15.735
Aren't you, um,
enjoying the party?

01:04:16.353 --> 01:04:18.947
I'm not sure enjoyment's
really my thing.

01:04:20.148 --> 01:04:21.741
I don't quite fit in.

01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:25.745
Even on my own, I don't fit in,
let alone with anyone else.

01:04:28.365 --> 01:04:31.585
- You live here?
- Oh, I'm just here for the weekend.

01:04:34.579 --> 01:04:36.422
I live in New York.

01:04:36.498 --> 01:04:38.546
- Crikey.
- Yeah, Morgan's my dad.

01:04:39.125 --> 01:04:40.752
Oh, right.

01:04:43.421 --> 01:04:45.423
How's that? Not too bad?

01:04:47.425 --> 01:04:49.268
Does he talk in a loud
voice all the time?

01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:56.059
Even his emails are loud.

01:05:02.816 --> 01:05:03.863
Hi.

01:05:05.610 --> 01:05:07.578
- Hi.
- Can I join you?

01:05:07.654 --> 01:05:09.656
Please do.

01:05:12.242 --> 01:05:14.244
- It's high up, yes?
- Yeah.

01:05:14.327 --> 01:05:16.045
It is.

01:05:21.334 --> 01:05:23.086
Do you know Paris well?

01:05:23.169 --> 01:05:25.388
No. No, not well.

01:05:27.799 --> 01:05:30.393
So we have, over there, the Louvre,

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:34.890
la Gare d'Orsay and the Tour
Montparnasse over there.

01:05:34.973 --> 01:05:37.772
- Mmm-hmm.
- Les Invalides.

01:05:37.851 --> 01:05:40.695
- L'Assemblée nationale.
- Oh, yes.

01:05:41.312 --> 01:05:42.564
L'Obelisk.

01:05:42.647 --> 01:05:45.366
- You see l'Obelisk?
- It's pretty.

01:05:49.863 --> 01:05:53.834
I mean, a weekend in Paris.
What a drag!

01:05:56.077 --> 01:05:58.079
The more out of it I am,
the better.

01:05:59.038 --> 01:06:01.587
You've obviously never
been to Birmingham.

01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:04.969
I'd make the most of
this city, if I were you.

01:06:05.962 --> 01:06:08.681
- That's what my dad says.
- He does?

01:06:11.885 --> 01:06:14.138
He and I don't really

01:06:14.596 --> 01:06:16.394
share that many interests.

01:06:16.473 --> 01:06:19.943
That's not unusual.

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:23.610
I mean, he likes the
idea of me being around.

01:06:25.064 --> 01:06:27.533
He sends me air tickets,

01:06:27.609 --> 01:06:31.830
but he really freaks out if we're
ever stuck in the same room together.

01:06:31.905 --> 01:06:35.409
He feels bad, guilty, I suppose.

01:06:36.576 --> 01:06:38.874
He hates being hated.

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:43.082
What about your mum?

01:06:43.958 --> 01:06:45.960
She's okay.

01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:48.922
She tried to,
you know, kill herself.

01:06:49.005 --> 01:06:50.723
Oh, fuck!

01:06:50.798 --> 01:06:53.176
Yeah, she, like,

01:06:53.259 --> 01:06:55.182
threw herself out of a window.

01:06:55.261 --> 01:06:57.605
Oh, my God!

01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:00.274
Yeah, but she's okay.

01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:02.352
She's over that now.

01:07:07.023 --> 01:07:08.384
<i>What are you thinking?</i>

01:07:08.483 --> 01:07:10.156
Sorry?

01:07:10.235 --> 01:07:12.658
What are you thinking
at this moment?

01:07:20.995 --> 01:07:24.875
The, um, situation of
a woman like me.

01:07:27.669 --> 01:07:30.923
Boredom, dissatisfaction...

01:07:32.924 --> 01:07:34.551
Fury.

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:38.183
And the clock ticking by.

01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:46.029
What a great thing.

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:49.403
What?

01:07:50.525 --> 01:07:54.155
To be so attuned to
your own unhappiness.

01:08:01.452 --> 01:08:03.079
Look...

01:08:03.162 --> 01:08:05.961
You see La... La Rue de Rivoli?

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:10.511
Around the corner,
there is a little bar

01:08:10.587 --> 01:08:13.386
where we could have
a drink, if you like.

01:08:19.636 --> 01:08:21.229
When?

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:26.398
Now, if you like.

01:08:50.501 --> 01:08:51.718
What do you do?

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:55.430
- I'm a teacher.
- A teacher?

01:08:55.506 --> 01:08:57.508
Yes, really.

01:09:13.316 --> 01:09:14.863
Jesus!

01:09:16.694 --> 01:09:19.868
Is that a fucking monkey
I see before me?

01:09:34.252 --> 01:09:36.846
Do you know what my
problem has been?

01:09:42.136 --> 01:09:46.767
I am one of those
unfortunate people

01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:50.149
who is congenitally
faithful to his wife.

01:09:53.606 --> 01:09:58.328
Unlike the rest of the population,
I don't want to go to bed with strangers.

01:09:59.278 --> 01:10:01.531
I only like her.

01:10:04.867 --> 01:10:08.337
For me, there's never been sex
without an attempt at love.

01:10:10.164 --> 01:10:12.132
Uh-huh?

01:10:14.168 --> 01:10:16.170
Love is the only interesting thing.

01:10:17.922 --> 01:10:21.392
It's far,
far more difficult to do than sex.

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:25.396
What is wrong with me?

01:10:29.142 --> 01:10:30.485
What's he telling you?

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:34.281
Urn, to be honest, it's
difficult to make sense of it.

01:10:36.357 --> 01:10:37.904
They want us to eat.

01:10:38.359 --> 01:10:39.736
Having a good time?

01:10:41.654 --> 01:10:43.452
A man asked me to
have a drink with him.

01:10:45.158 --> 01:10:47.035
Did he?

01:10:47.452 --> 01:10:48.795
What did you say?

01:10:51.873 --> 01:10:53.466
I said yes.

01:10:57.336 --> 01:10:58.963
When?

01:10:59.046 --> 01:11:01.048
Later tonight.

01:11:03.426 --> 01:11:05.849
Don't do that.
Please don't do that.

01:11:08.514 --> 01:11:10.687
I want to go.

01:11:19.025 --> 01:11:22.404
Um... Here, you should take these.

01:11:22.487 --> 01:11:24.489
You might need them.

01:11:25.281 --> 01:11:30.082
We are all here to celebrate
the brilliance of this.

01:11:30.495 --> 01:11:32.175
Ah!

01:11:32.246 --> 01:11:33.919
Bravo!

01:11:35.833 --> 01:11:37.801
Bravo! Bravo!

01:11:37.877 --> 01:11:39.174
No...

01:11:39.253 --> 01:11:44.134
Yeah, which he wrote while working,
while running our lives,

01:11:44.467 --> 01:11:46.344
attending to me,

01:11:46.427 --> 01:11:49.431
buying art and learning Russian.

01:11:49.514 --> 01:11:51.482
Yeah, that's true.

01:11:51.557 --> 01:11:55.061
Yeah, he has the
energy of 100 teenagers.

01:11:55.144 --> 01:11:56.646
Yes.

01:11:56.729 --> 01:11:59.573
But wait. He's dark.
He's moody.

01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:01.117
Moody?

01:12:01.192 --> 01:12:02.660
Yes.

01:12:02.735 --> 01:12:05.454
He talks all the time,
all through breakfast.

01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:10.080
In fact, he talks even
when he's on the toilet.

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:12.537
I'm stunned.
That's dessert talk.

01:12:13.704 --> 01:12:17.174
Yeah, he has more exes, I think,
than Pére-Lachaise.

01:12:18.751 --> 01:12:22.631
But I... I agreed to take him on.

01:12:23.005 --> 01:12:25.724
<i>Mmm, pourquoi? Pourquoi?</i>

01:12:26.175 --> 01:12:27.301
idiocy.

01:12:28.386 --> 01:12:29.683
Idiocy? idiocy?

01:12:31.472 --> 01:12:32.473
No, love.

01:12:34.892 --> 01:12:36.565
Yes, love.

01:12:41.065 --> 01:12:42.612
To you, my love.

01:12:43.359 --> 01:12:45.077
To Morgan.

01:12:45.653 --> 01:12:47.326
Cheers. <i>Santé.</i>

01:12:47.405 --> 01:12:50.329
- Santé. Cheers.
- Thank you. Thank you.

01:12:51.534 --> 01:12:54.413
Thank you, sweet. Let me say it quick.
Let me get this over with.

01:12:54.495 --> 01:12:58.796
Thank you. What have I done to deserve
such love, and from my wife of all people?

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.798
Oh, my golly!

01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:02.962
Well, just very quickly,
thank you all for coming.

01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:06.219
Those books, by the way,
they're gonna be in a box in the hall.

01:13:06.299 --> 01:13:08.802
So on your way out, take five or ten,
as many as you want.

01:13:08.885 --> 01:13:12.014
Some are even unsigned.
I think that makes them more valuable.

01:13:12.513 --> 01:13:16.768
But may I take this opportunity not to say
anything more about that lousy little book,

01:13:16.851 --> 01:13:19.445
which already is,
frankly, wildly out of date,

01:13:19.812 --> 01:13:22.406
but about this fella right here?

01:13:23.190 --> 01:13:28.117
Nick Burrows, who I found yesterday,
as you do so often with old friends,

01:13:28.195 --> 01:13:30.869
kissing a woman
passionately in the street.

01:13:30.948 --> 01:13:32.825
He later claimed that
that woman was his wife.

01:13:38.664 --> 01:13:40.416
But, no, you know.

01:13:40.499 --> 01:13:46.427
I'm thinking back right now, uh, on a
time when you and I were skulking around

01:13:47.089 --> 01:13:50.810
and loitering in
gloomy Cambridge pubs,

01:13:51.093 --> 01:13:53.312
presuming to figure out
how to fix the world.

01:13:53.804 --> 01:13:57.354
I made him take me
on as his disciple

01:13:57.934 --> 01:14:02.235
and stalked him at meetings
and followed him around

01:14:02.647 --> 01:14:06.527
to these little bring-your-own-bottle
parties in bedsits

01:14:06.609 --> 01:14:10.159
and grubby little restaurants
with names like Eros

01:14:10.237 --> 01:14:12.331
and The Whim.

01:14:12.406 --> 01:14:17.412
He started to shame me
into reading real things.

01:14:18.079 --> 01:14:22.050
You made me concentrate for more
than five minutes at a time.

01:14:22.375 --> 01:14:26.630
And he made me say true things

01:14:27.338 --> 01:14:33.095
for the first time in my short and
well-upholstered Yankee life.

01:14:35.346 --> 01:14:36.598
My gosh.

01:14:37.723 --> 01:14:41.978
I thank you publicly
for keeping the torch burning,

01:14:43.187 --> 01:14:47.237
as you have done so
magnificently over these years.

01:14:47.817 --> 01:14:52.448
Ladies and gents,
may we raise a glass

01:14:52.655 --> 01:14:56.000
to my friend Nick Burrows.

01:14:56.951 --> 01:14:58.248
Thank you, Nick.

01:14:58.327 --> 01:15:00.125
To Nick Burrows.

01:15:00.204 --> 01:15:01.922
<i>Santé.</i>

01:15:02.456 --> 01:15:05.335
Thank you, my friend.

01:15:07.837 --> 01:15:10.056
Fuck.

01:15:11.966 --> 01:15:13.639
Shit... Um...

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:16.971
Fucking hell.

01:15:17.304 --> 01:15:19.557
Thank you for that, Morgan.

01:15:21.267 --> 01:15:23.269
I'm grateful for what you said.

01:15:23.936 --> 01:15:25.233
Um...

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:30.944
I'm surprised, too,
and taken aback, quite far back.

01:15:32.236 --> 01:15:33.658
But I was reminded of something.

01:15:36.699 --> 01:15:38.292
Of myself.

01:15:41.078 --> 01:15:43.501
Of the self

01:15:43.581 --> 01:15:45.800
I hide in myself.

01:15:49.128 --> 01:15:52.223
I'm still an anarchist
of the left, I suppose.

01:15:53.132 --> 01:15:54.850
I'm still a fool for the truth.

01:15:55.593 --> 01:15:57.812
Always my weak point.

01:15:59.513 --> 01:16:02.733
So I suppose I should,
on that basis, point out

01:16:03.059 --> 01:16:06.063
that the university where I teach
is not a proper university,

01:16:06.145 --> 01:16:11.493
but it's an ex-polytechnic, which is now
a factory on the outskirts of Birmingham,

01:16:12.651 --> 01:16:16.246
set up to produce only idiocy.

01:16:19.450 --> 01:16:22.545
I should point out that
I have just been sacked

01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:28.673
for apparently speaking inappropriately
to a female black student.

01:16:31.087 --> 01:16:36.810
My older son is a pot-head with rats
in the house that we bought for him

01:16:37.176 --> 01:16:39.395
with the last of our savings.

01:16:40.554 --> 01:16:43.774
His chosen profession is to watch
television in the afternoons.

01:16:44.975 --> 01:16:45.976
I'm broke.

01:16:47.311 --> 01:16:50.315
Every bone and muscle in my
body screams with agony

01:16:50.397 --> 01:16:52.399
when I attempt to tie my shoelaces.

01:16:55.528 --> 01:16:59.829
I'm near shitting myself with fear
and anxiety every moment of the day.

01:17:07.998 --> 01:17:11.047
Plus the fact my wife is well aware

01:17:11.127 --> 01:17:16.805
that I only cling to her like a
drowning man to a shelf of melting ice

01:17:18.509 --> 01:17:20.603
because no one else would touch me.

01:17:23.848 --> 01:17:26.772
She's planning, in fact,
to give me the slip later this evening

01:17:26.851 --> 01:17:29.024
in order to be with another man.
Well, good for her.

01:17:29.854 --> 01:17:31.481
And good for him, too.

01:17:32.356 --> 01:17:36.953
So think of me as
falling out of a window...

01:17:39.572 --> 01:17:41.165
Forever.

01:17:43.617 --> 01:17:45.915
For I am truly fucked.

01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:01.014
Oh, man, that was awesome.

01:18:09.435 --> 01:18:11.733
Is that it?
Did I leave anything out?

01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:20.788
Can I say something, please?

01:18:21.238 --> 01:18:23.240
Go ahead, please.

01:18:25.534 --> 01:18:28.629
I was on the balcony just now
talking to Jean-Pierre.

01:18:32.041 --> 01:18:35.215
I remembered something
from the other day,

01:18:36.045 --> 01:18:39.470
when I was with a friend.

01:18:40.382 --> 01:18:42.384
And my phone rang.

01:18:45.137 --> 01:18:46.639
And, um.

01:18:46.722 --> 01:18:50.397
I spoke with the person.

01:18:51.310 --> 01:18:54.655
And at the end of the call,
she said,

01:18:55.814 --> 01:18:57.566
"Who was that?

01:18:58.609 --> 01:18:59.952
"Was it your secret lover?

01:19:02.363 --> 01:19:04.957
"You sounded so pleased
to hear from them,

01:19:07.034 --> 01:19:08.377
"and you kept laughing."

01:19:11.872 --> 01:19:14.341
I was astonished.
I said,

01:19:14.541 --> 01:19:16.543
"What do you mean?

01:19:17.336 --> 01:19:19.338
"It was my husband."

01:19:25.052 --> 01:19:27.054
it was my husband.

01:19:36.021 --> 01:19:38.023
Nick?

01:19:38.732 --> 01:19:40.734
Are you guys...
Oh, are you...

01:19:40.943 --> 01:19:42.195
Are you heading out?

01:19:42.278 --> 01:19:45.498
That was genius.
Genius, as always.

01:19:46.323 --> 01:19:49.327
Gee, I wish you didn't
have to rush away.

01:19:49.410 --> 01:19:52.835
I'm so sorry if I...
Did I say something possibly...

01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:55.833
How long are you guys
gonna be here for?

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.846
Because I know you said the weekend,
but I don't know specifically.

01:20:00.587 --> 01:20:02.305
Do you still have my number?

01:20:02.381 --> 01:20:04.725
Did you transfer, uh...

01:20:05.884 --> 01:20:09.354
'Cause you can text me.
We don't even have to speak.

01:20:12.599 --> 01:20:14.522
I love you!

01:20:24.570 --> 01:20:26.572
You fucking idiot.

01:20:27.531 --> 01:20:29.374
You genius.

01:20:29.450 --> 01:20:31.452
How could you do that?

01:20:33.162 --> 01:20:35.631
Talent.

01:20:35.706 --> 01:20:38.129
I nearly...

01:20:38.208 --> 01:20:39.755
Puked.

01:20:40.210 --> 01:20:41.678
Thank you.

01:20:44.923 --> 01:20:45.924
<i>You know what?</i>

01:20:47.343 --> 01:20:51.894
The other day at that
dinner at Ellie's,

01:20:51.972 --> 01:20:54.191
you did this thing.

01:20:54.975 --> 01:21:00.027
You came over and you kissed
me on the side of the head.

01:21:01.732 --> 01:21:03.575
Just casually.

01:21:04.902 --> 01:21:07.246
But I thought it was
the loveliest thing.

01:21:07.571 --> 01:21:10.040
Thanks.

01:21:12.826 --> 01:21:14.453
Now.

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:16.789
Again, do it again.

01:21:42.648 --> 01:21:44.742
Time to pack, I guess.

01:21:45.359 --> 01:21:48.033
French stairs, my abiding memory.

01:21:48.821 --> 01:21:50.789
You can get the lift.

01:21:57.079 --> 01:21:58.877
- What's going on?
- Madame, I'm sorry.

01:21:58.956 --> 01:22:01.076
We have instructions to refuse
you entry to this room.

01:22:01.083 --> 01:22:03.836
- You've been checked out.
- Why? It's not midday.

01:22:05.671 --> 01:22:08.720
You are forbidden to touch anything
in here. Again, I apologise.

01:22:08.799 --> 01:22:11.427
Please, give me that hat, ma'am.
Come on, give it to me.

01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:14.764
- It's an outrage! It's ridiculous!
- Give it to me. Come on.

01:22:14.847 --> 01:22:16.770
- Ha ha!
- Wahey!

01:22:18.767 --> 01:22:20.110
Come on!

01:22:20.185 --> 01:22:21.528
Quickly!

01:22:23.313 --> 01:22:24.940
<i>Pardon.</i>

01:22:32.197 --> 01:22:34.165
<i>Pardon, monsieur.
Pardon, pardon.</i>

01:22:34.241 --> 01:22:35.788
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

01:22:35.868 --> 01:22:37.620
<i>Merci, merci.</i>

01:22:39.746 --> 01:22:41.123
Pardon.

01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:43.792
<i>Pardon, monsieur.</i>

01:22:44.084 --> 01:22:46.086
<i>Excusez-moi,
pardon, pardon.</i>

01:22:47.129 --> 01:22:48.972
<i>Excusez-moi. Merci.</i>

01:22:52.759 --> 01:22:54.853
Ah, Mr and Mrs Burrows.

01:22:54.928 --> 01:22:58.307
Please accept my deepest apology
for our little difficulty.

01:22:58.390 --> 01:23:01.610
But I'm sure we can sort
everything out very quickly.

01:23:02.561 --> 01:23:04.734
- Will you please follow me?
- Yeah.

01:23:07.608 --> 01:23:10.031
Of course, we have your
passports in our safe.

01:23:10.110 --> 01:23:11.236
But why?

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:14.119
The credit card you gave
us is beyond its limit.

01:23:14.198 --> 01:23:16.417
See... Here's the bill.

01:23:17.242 --> 01:23:18.915
Right.

01:23:20.621 --> 01:23:22.123
Mmm-hmm.

01:23:23.999 --> 01:23:26.343
Oh, yes, that's, um...

01:23:26.418 --> 01:23:28.762
Yes, that is quite a lot of money.

01:23:28.837 --> 01:23:32.933
Yeah. There is also the matter,
I fear, of the damage to the room.

01:23:33.008 --> 01:23:34.806
- There is?
- Yes.

01:23:35.093 --> 01:23:36.345
Plus the tax, of course.

01:23:37.095 --> 01:23:40.190
- It looks like we got carried away.
- Oh?

01:23:41.141 --> 01:23:43.360
- It was worth it.
- Yeah.

01:23:43.435 --> 01:23:45.984
Mr Burrows,
you have another carol?

01:23:47.606 --> 01:23:49.233
Only my bus pass, I'm afraid.

01:23:49.399 --> 01:23:52.403
And how do you intend to pay?

01:23:54.446 --> 01:23:56.869
With our lives?

01:23:57.658 --> 01:24:00.207
Unfortunately, it's no longer
a matter of laughing, madam.

01:24:01.036 --> 01:24:03.164
In fact, it's a very
serious matter indeed.

01:24:03.664 --> 01:24:05.587
- A very serious matter.
- Yeah.

01:24:05.666 --> 01:24:07.509
I'm not listening to
any more of this.

01:24:25.143 --> 01:24:27.111
That's me bust.

01:24:34.361 --> 01:24:36.580
- What are you doing?
- Texting Morgan.

01:24:38.073 --> 01:24:39.325
Why?

01:24:39.408 --> 01:24:41.126
He's our only hope, isn't he?

01:24:41.201 --> 01:24:42.953
Oh, shit.

01:24:43.036 --> 01:24:45.209
- Hi, Jack.
<i>- Hey, Dad. Having a lovely time?</i>

01:24:45.289 --> 01:24:47.883
- We're having a fine time.
<i>- Making friends with many frogs?</i>

01:24:47.958 --> 01:24:50.711
No, we haven't met any
French people yet, no.

01:24:50.794 --> 01:24:52.137
<i>Have you come to a decision?</i>

01:24:52.212 --> 01:24:53.885
Well, yes and no.

01:24:53.964 --> 01:24:55.807
Your mother says
it wouldn't be a good idea

01:24:55.882 --> 01:24:57.759
for you to move back in with us.

01:24:57.843 --> 01:25:00.221
You'll be better off
staying with a mate.

01:25:01.346 --> 01:25:02.814
Yeah.

01:25:02.889 --> 01:25:05.392
Yeah, we're enjoying
being on our own now.

01:25:06.643 --> 01:25:08.941
Well, we hope to be back soon.

01:25:09.187 --> 01:25:11.565
- But you do realise...
- No, sorry.

01:25:11.648 --> 01:25:12.945
Sorry.

01:25:13.025 --> 01:25:14.993
Hello? Hello?

01:25:15.068 --> 01:25:17.287
- Are you there? Can you hear me?
<i>- Hello?</i>

01:25:17.362 --> 01:25:19.706
- Hello? Hello?
- Dad?

01:25:21.325 --> 01:25:23.043
We got cut off.

01:25:36.298 --> 01:25:38.016
Yes!

01:25:38.091 --> 01:25:39.638
What?

01:25:44.222 --> 01:25:46.600
I said you had the euros.

01:25:51.104 --> 01:25:53.198
<i>- Voilà, monsieur.</i>
- Merci.

01:25:56.276 --> 01:25:59.496
We can't do a runner from this place,
we'd get beaten to death.

01:26:02.282 --> 01:26:04.284
It's been the best time.

01:26:07.371 --> 01:26:09.373
The best.

01:26:59.589 --> 01:27:00.966
Oh!

01:27:01.508 --> 01:27:04.808
Oh, my God, are you kidding?
My pleasure!

01:27:04.886 --> 01:27:06.854
What... What's happening?

01:27:06.930 --> 01:27:09.774
Well, we've had...
A couple of little problems.

01:27:09.850 --> 01:27:12.399
- Really? Like what?
- Well...

01:27:12.477 --> 01:27:16.823
You guys have just been
having like a great, great time.

01:27:16.898 --> 01:27:18.616
We certainly have.

01:27:18.692 --> 01:27:20.035
I guess you have.

01:27:21.528 --> 01:27:24.782
I think you'd better stay at my
place till you sort yourself out,

01:27:24.865 --> 01:27:26.663
which could take a while.

01:27:26.742 --> 01:27:29.211
- Thanks, that's kind.
- Yes, yes, my pleasure.

01:27:29.286 --> 01:27:33.291
I'll get some food and we'll
have a great evening in.

01:27:34.332 --> 01:27:39.088
Do you like that idea?
We'll play music and dance.

01:27:39.171 --> 01:27:41.799
Yeah. Would you like to
sing, by any chance?

01:27:41.882 --> 01:27:44.510
- I'd love to sing.
- I'd love to hear you sing.

01:27:45.305 --> 01:27:51.388
