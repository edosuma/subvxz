WEBVTT

00:01.302 --> 00:02.573
HEY, WHO WANTS TO DO
SOMETHING FUN?

00:02.573 --> 00:04.035
I DO!
ME!

00:04.035 --> 00:05.306
GREAT. WE'RE GONNA GO
TO MY DAD'S HOUSE

00:05.306 --> 00:07.138
AND HELP HIM FIND HIS GLASSES.

00:07.138 --> 00:09.280
I THOUGHT IF I SAID IT IN
A HAPPY TONE, YOU'D BE EXCITED.

00:09.280 --> 00:10.611
DID NOT WORK.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.543
ELLIE, ARE YOU OKAY?
YOU SEEM WIPED OUT.

00:12.543 --> 00:14.745
I WAS BOOK MOM AT STAN'S CLASS
YESTERDAY,

00:14.745 --> 00:16.787
SO I HAD TO GET UP AT 8:00 A.M.

00:16.787 --> 00:18.289
WHAT AM I, A COAL MINER?

00:18.289 --> 00:20.051
AND IT'S FLU SEASON.

00:20.051 --> 00:22.353
MOST OF THOSE LITTLE BRATS WERE
SNOTTY, WHINY MESSES.

00:23.694 --> 00:26.097
YOU... DIDN'T CATCH ANYTHING,
DID YOU?

00:26.097 --> 00:28.699
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
ELLIE IS CRAZY WHEN SHE'S SICK.

00:28.699 --> 00:31.502
REMEMBER THE GREAT STOMACH VIRUS
OF '09,

00:31.502 --> 00:33.134
WHEN SHE BURNED DOWN THE SHED?

00:33.134 --> 00:34.565
OR THE TIME SHE GOT
STREP THROAT

00:34.565 --> 00:36.507
AND SERVED ME
WITH DIVORCE PAPERS?

00:36.507 --> 00:38.539
I CALLED IT OFF.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.371
I HAD TO PAY 2 GRAND
IN LEGAL FEES!

00:40.371 --> 00:42.243
I FEEL OKAY.

00:43.644 --> 00:45.116
SHE'S WARM.

00:47.248 --> 00:49.180
JUST MORE FOR US.

00:49.180 --> 00:54.185
в™Єв™Єв™Є

00:54.185 --> 00:57.428
FOUND 'EM. IT WAS UNDER
A "TV GUIDE" FROM 1985.

00:57.428 --> 00:59.790
MICHAEL LANDON CAN TAKE
A HIGHWAY TO MY HOUSE. MMM!

00:59.790 --> 01:01.762
OKAY. THANKS.

01:01.762 --> 01:04.795
COME ON, DAD. HAVE YOU BEEN
SITTING HERE ALL DAY?

01:04.795 --> 01:06.737
COME ON,
LET'S GO DO SOMETHING.

01:06.737 --> 01:09.300
I'M WATCHING
A HOME REPAIR SHOW.

01:09.300 --> 01:11.302
THEY'RE GONNA PAINT
THAT FENCE.

01:11.302 --> 01:13.444
WHY DON'T WE GO TO
THAT NEW TAPAS RESTAURANT?

01:13.444 --> 01:14.775
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE GREAT.

01:14.775 --> 01:16.777
I DON'T CARE FOR HEALTH FOOD.

01:16.777 --> 01:19.710
OH! I KNOW.
TEACH ME THE JITTERBUG.

01:19.710 --> 01:21.612
REMEMBER YOU WANTED ME TO
LEARN AS A KID?

01:21.612 --> 01:24.084
COME ON.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.456
ISN'T THIS FUN?

01:25.456 --> 01:27.658
YOU'RE BLOCKING THE TV.

01:30.561 --> 01:32.423
EVER SINCE
HIS ALZHEIMER'S DIAGNOSIS,

01:32.423 --> 01:35.266
HE'S JUST BEEN SITTING AROUND,
DOING NOTHING.

01:35.266 --> 01:37.468
I WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING
I COULD DO TO GET HIM EXCITED.

01:37.468 --> 01:39.170
SIGN HIM UP AT
THE SENIOR CENTER.

01:39.170 --> 01:41.872
OLD PEOPLE ARE REALLY
PROMISCUOUS THESE DAYS.

01:41.872 --> 01:43.834
HE'D HAVE A BLAST.

01:43.834 --> 01:45.636
GROSS. GRANDPA DOESN'T WANNA
SLUT IT UP

01:45.636 --> 01:48.108
WITH A BUNCH OF OLD BIDDIES.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.540
OKAY, HE PROBABLY DOES.
BUT STILL... GROSS.

01:49.540 --> 01:51.312
WHAT ABOUT AN ART CLASS?

01:51.312 --> 01:53.884
OR AN ACTING CLASS.
I COULD AUDIT ONE WITH HIM.

01:53.884 --> 01:56.287
OH, DO YOU STILL WANT
TO BE AN ACTOR?

01:56.287 --> 01:58.249
TOO BAD YOU'RE TERRIBLE
AT ACTING.

01:58.249 --> 02:00.391
E-TRAIN, SHOULD YOU BE DRINKING
WINE IF YOU'RE SICK?

02:00.391 --> 02:02.623
I PUT, UM, FLU MEDICINE IN HERE.
(door opens)

02:03.824 --> 02:07.258
MY JOB AS MAYOR OF GULFHAVEN
IS IN SERIOUS JEOPARDY!

02:07.258 --> 02:11.162
I WAS CAUGHT FALLING ASLEEP
AT A TOWN HALL MEETING.

02:11.162 --> 02:13.364
(Jules laughing) "SNORRES"!
THAT'S HYSTERICAL!

02:13.364 --> 02:15.766
(slaps leg)
WHY DIDN'T WE THINK OF THAT?

02:15.766 --> 02:17.608
ALL THIS TIME, I'VE BEEN
CALLING HIM "BORRES."

02:17.608 --> 02:19.170
(Jules laughs)

02:19.170 --> 02:20.541
OH, HEY,
I REALLY DON'T APPRECIATE

02:20.541 --> 02:22.513
YOU GUYS MAKING FUN
OF MY BEST FRIEND.

02:22.513 --> 02:23.874
(mouths word)
OH!

02:23.874 --> 02:26.847
BECAUSE YOUR NAME IS TORRES
AND IT RHYMES!

02:26.847 --> 02:28.419
(all laughing)

02:28.419 --> 02:30.881
(Jules) SNORRES!
(snores)

02:30.881 --> 02:32.383
(Jules) OH!

02:32.383 --> 02:33.754
HEY, BABE, WILL YOU PASS ME
A NAPKIN?

02:33.754 --> 02:35.186
SURE THING, BABE.

02:35.186 --> 02:36.487
WHAT'S WITH
THE "BABE" SANDWICH?

02:36.487 --> 02:37.858
TRAVIS AND I ARE TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

02:37.858 --> 02:39.860
OUR RELATIONSHIP PET NAMES.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.432
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, BABE?

02:41.432 --> 02:43.163
YOU KNOW IT, BABE.
MMM.

02:43.163 --> 02:46.267
DON'T USE "BABE," OKAY?
THAT'S HORRIBLE.

02:46.267 --> 02:48.599
ALSO, THAT'S JULES' AND MINE.

02:48.599 --> 02:51.742
G-MAN, I PICKED UP
A LOCAL THEATER MAGAZINE.

02:51.742 --> 02:53.604
THE GIRL ON THE COVER HAD
BIG BOOBIES.

02:53.604 --> 02:57.448
AND LISTEN TO THIS--
AN AUDITION FOR A COMMERCIAL.

02:57.448 --> 03:01.282
"MEN OVER 40, RUGGED GOOD LOOKS,
AND IN GREAT SHAPE."

03:01.282 --> 03:02.783
(taps magazine)
THAT'S YOU!

03:02.783 --> 03:04.585
I DON'T KNOW, BOBBY.

03:04.585 --> 03:06.487
I THINK IT MIGHT BE TIME FOR ME
TO GIVE UP ON MY ACTING DREAM.

03:06.487 --> 03:07.858
NEVER GIVE UP ON A DREAM, MAN.

03:07.858 --> 03:10.190
JUST LOOK AT HARRY POTTER.
HE NEVER GAVE UP.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.592
YOU READ THOSE BOOKS?

03:11.592 --> 03:14.465
BOOKS? I'M TALKING ABOUT
MY OLD NEIGHBOR HARRY.

03:14.465 --> 03:16.797
RIGHT? HE USED TO LIVE IN
A BUICK PARKED NEXT TO THE BOAT.

03:16.797 --> 03:19.230
AND THEN HE INVENTED
THE "POTTER SQUATTER."

03:19.230 --> 03:20.531
WHAT'S THE POTTER SQUATTER?

03:20.531 --> 03:21.932
IT'S A MOBILE POOPER.

03:21.932 --> 03:23.574
NOW HARRY LIVES IN A MANSION,

03:23.574 --> 03:24.875
WHILE HIS SISTER PATTY
WENT TO JAIL.

03:24.875 --> 03:27.408
WHY? 'CAUSE SHE GAVE UP
ON HER DREAMS.

03:27.408 --> 03:29.780
SHE ALSO LIKED TO STEAL WALLETS
AND PURSES.

03:29.780 --> 03:32.643
PATTY POTTER PICKED POCKETS?

03:32.643 --> 03:34.285
AND PURSES.

03:34.285 --> 03:36.317
JUST GO ON AN AUDITION, MAN.

03:36.317 --> 03:39.790
IF YOU BELIEVE YOU CAN GET IT,
YOU CAN.

03:39.790 --> 03:42.353
YEAH. WHY NOT? THANKS, BOBBY.

03:42.353 --> 03:45.456
YOU WANNA SPLIT
SOME POTATO SKINS, POODLE?
MNH-MNH.

03:45.456 --> 03:46.727
MUFFIN?
NO.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.228
PUG BUTT?
WHAT?

03:48.228 --> 03:50.801
I WISH I KNEW A WAY
TO GET MY DAD EXCITED.

03:50.801 --> 03:52.663
MAYBE I SHOULD GET HIM
A PET.

03:52.663 --> 03:54.565
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA, JULES.

03:54.565 --> 03:56.407
I JUST NEED TO FIND SOMETHING
TO KEEP THE PUBLIC DISTRACTED

03:56.407 --> 03:58.269
FROM MY POLITICAL SCANDAL.

03:58.269 --> 03:59.640
WAIT. DID YOU JUST SWITCH
THE CONVERSATION

03:59.640 --> 04:01.372
FROM MY THING TO YOUR THING?

04:01.372 --> 04:02.943
I THOUGHT I COULD DO IT IN A WAY
NO ONE WOULD NOTICE.

04:02.943 --> 04:04.415
EPIC FAIL!

04:04.415 --> 04:05.646
I HAVE THREE PUPPIES.

04:05.646 --> 04:07.278
YOU'D GIVE CHICK
ONE OF YOUR PUPPIES?

04:07.278 --> 04:08.879
(laughs) HUH? OH, SORRY..
I WAS ON ANDY'S THING.

04:08.879 --> 04:11.382
I WAS GONNA SUGGEST
A PUPPY RACE.

04:11.382 --> 04:14.655
PUPPY RACE?
YOU'RE THE DUMBEST PERSON EVER.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.527
WAIT! THAT'S THE ANSWER!
A RACE!

04:16.527 --> 04:18.489
OH, I CAN ORGANIZE
A GULFHAVEN 5K.

04:18.489 --> 04:20.531
PEOPLE GO CRAZY
FOR THAT KIND OF STUFF.

04:20.531 --> 04:23.294
WOULD YOU QUIT STEPPING
ON MY THING FOR YOUR THING?

04:23.294 --> 04:25.296
WAIT. A RACE! (gasps)

04:25.296 --> 04:27.538
I THINK YOUR THING
JUST ANSWERED MY THING!

04:27.538 --> 04:29.600
CHICK WAS A TRACK COACH.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.442
IF WE ALL SAY THAT
WE'RE GONNA RUN A 5K

04:31.442 --> 04:34.475
AND ASK HIM FOR HIS HELP,
HE'D BE THRILLED.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.847
"US"?
WELL, IF I'M RUNNING,
YOU'RE RUNNING.

04:36.847 --> 04:38.409
(scoffs) ARE YOU NEW
TO THIS GROUP?

04:38.409 --> 04:39.950
(groans)

04:39.950 --> 04:42.052
NOT YOU, ELLIE. YOU GET ON
THAT COUCH, PUT YOUR FEET UP.

04:42.052 --> 04:43.854
NO EXERCISE FOR YOU.

04:43.854 --> 04:45.916
I SHOULD, SHOULDN'T I?
(Andy) OOH!

04:45.916 --> 04:48.459
(whines)

04:48.459 --> 04:52.292
OKAY, LET ME MAKE YOU
ANOTHER COUGH-TAIL.

04:54.895 --> 04:56.567
BOBBY COBB,
YOU SON OF A BITCH!

04:56.567 --> 04:57.968
HUH? WH--

04:57.968 --> 04:59.670
YOU HAD SEX WITH MY SISTER,
DIDN'T YOU?!

04:59.670 --> 05:01.001
YOU GOT HER PREGNANT,

05:01.001 --> 05:03.404
AND NOW YOU'RE DENYING
YOU'RE THE FATHER?!

05:03.404 --> 05:04.975
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
I'M SORRY, MAN!

05:04.975 --> 05:06.507
I'LL--I'LL--I'LL DO THE RIGHT
THING, MAN. I'LL MARRY HER.

05:06.507 --> 05:07.878
(laughs) RELAX, BOBBY.

05:07.878 --> 05:09.380
I WAS JUST ACTING.

05:09.380 --> 05:11.742
OH, MAN! YOU HAD ME GOIN'.

05:11.742 --> 05:13.984
WELL, WAIT A MINUTE.
DOES THIS MEAN...

05:13.984 --> 05:16.647
I GOT IT! (laughing)
YEAH! NEAT, DUDE!

05:16.647 --> 05:18.018
WHAT'S THE COMMERCIAL FOR?

05:18.018 --> 05:19.520
IT'S FOR
THIS SPORTS DEODORANT.

05:19.520 --> 05:20.821
I PLAY THIS ATHLETIC STUD

05:20.821 --> 05:22.793
WHO SPIKES VOLLEYBALLS
AND WORKS OUT.

05:22.793 --> 05:25.055
AND THEN I GET SEEN BY
THIS TOTALLY HOT BEACH BUNNY,

05:25.055 --> 05:26.797
AND IT IS ON!

05:26.797 --> 05:28.429
I WANT THAT PRODUCT.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.631
THANKS FOR BELIEVING IN ME,
BOBBY.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.533
BUT IF YOU EVER TOUCH
MY SISTER...

05:32.533 --> 05:33.764
I WON'T! I PROMISE!

05:33.764 --> 05:35.065
AW!

05:35.065 --> 05:37.067
(both laugh)

05:42.373 --> 05:43.674
(gasps)

05:44.945 --> 05:46.647
EE! OHH. (breathes deeply)

05:46.647 --> 05:48.348
OH, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE DEAD.

05:48.348 --> 05:52.022
DEAD?
I'VE NEVER FELT MORE ALIVE.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.886
IS A POPSICLE GOOD
FOR THE FLU?

05:55.886 --> 05:57.928
IT IS WHEN IT'S FROZEN RED WINE
AND COUGH SYRUP.

05:57.928 --> 05:59.560
(coughs)

06:00.861 --> 06:02.433
ELLIE, YOU'RE AS COLD
AS A CORPSE.

06:02.433 --> 06:04.565
LET ME GET YOU A BLANKET.

06:04.565 --> 06:06.036
(hisses)

06:06.036 --> 06:09.400
SORRY. I'LL JUST... GO NOW.

06:11.902 --> 06:13.444
THIS IS GONNA BE AWFUL.

06:13.444 --> 06:14.805
THE LAST TIME I RAN

06:14.805 --> 06:16.507
WAS WHEN I PUNCHED THAT FLAMINGO
AT BUSCH GARDENS.

06:16.507 --> 06:17.878
IN MY DEFENSE,

06:17.878 --> 06:19.710
IT DID STEAL THE HOT DOG
RIGHT OUT OF MY HAND,

06:19.710 --> 06:22.613
AND YOU CAN'T DO THAT TO
A FORMER FOSTER KID.

06:22.613 --> 06:24.054
RIGHT, TATER TOT?

06:24.054 --> 06:25.856
AH! LET'S NOT GO
BLURTIN' OUT PET NAMES

06:25.856 --> 06:27.117
BEFORE THEY'RE OFFICIAL.

06:27.117 --> 06:28.759
WE DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO STICK.

06:28.759 --> 06:30.120
TOO LATE, TATER TOT.

06:30.120 --> 06:32.022
HA HA!

06:32.022 --> 06:33.724
IT'S JUST A 5K. HOW TOUGH
COULD THE TRAINING BE?

06:33.724 --> 06:35.566
OW!
I'LL TELL YOU HOW TOUGH
IT CAN BE

06:35.566 --> 06:37.628
AFTER YOU GIVE ME 50 CRUNCHES.

06:37.628 --> 06:39.169
DOWN!

06:41.872 --> 06:43.474
(lowered voice) THANK YOU
FOR LETTING ME

06:43.474 --> 06:44.835
BE PART OF THE TEAM,
JUNEBUG.
(chuckles)

06:44.835 --> 06:46.637
WHAT ARE YOU ALL GAWKING AT?

06:46.637 --> 06:48.178
500 JUMPING JACKS! GO!

06:48.178 --> 06:50.410
I'M WINDING UP BESSIE...

06:50.410 --> 06:52.583
NO!
OKAY.

06:52.583 --> 06:55.415
(panting) JULES,
YOUR DAD COACHED TRACK?

06:55.415 --> 06:57.548
YEAH. TRACK, SOCCER, FOOTBALL...

06:57.548 --> 06:59.119
BACK BEFORE THEY HAD HELMETS.

06:59.119 --> 07:02.853
AW, MAN. THIS IS GONNA SUCK.

07:02.853 --> 07:04.424
OW! MOTHER! MM!

07:04.424 --> 07:06.457
COME ON! GET WITH IT!

07:08.899 --> 07:11.131
THERE'S DIRT IN MY EYE!
I'M A BRAIN SURGEON!

07:11.131 --> 07:14.605
ALL I CAN HEAR IS
"WAH! WAH! WAH!"

07:14.605 --> 07:16.537
I FORGOT HOW TOUGH
CHICK COULD BE.

07:16.537 --> 07:17.938
HOW COULD YOU UNLEASH THIS
ON US?

07:17.938 --> 07:20.010
WELL, WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO,
TATER TOT?

07:20.010 --> 07:22.943
JUST SIT BACK AND WATCH HIM
GIVE UP ON LIFE?

07:22.943 --> 07:24.575
COME ON, WE CAN DO THIS.

07:24.575 --> 07:27.748
I'LL JUST TELL HIM TO BACK OFF
A LITTLE BIT.

07:27.748 --> 07:30.481
HEY, DAD,
WE DON'T NEED TO WORK TOO HARD.

07:30.481 --> 07:32.022
IT'S JUST A 5K.

07:32.022 --> 07:34.925
I HAVE TWO COACHING SPEEDS--
ZERO AND TURBO.

07:34.925 --> 07:36.627
IF YOU WOULD PREFER ZERO,

07:36.627 --> 07:38.789
I'LL BE HAPPY TO TURN AROUND
AND GO HOME.

07:38.789 --> 07:41.461
NO, NO. PLEASE DON'T GO.
WE'LL DO TURBO.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.994
I WAS HOPING YOU'D SAY THAT.

07:43.994 --> 07:45.465
(blows whistle)

07:45.465 --> 07:47.638
LINE UP FOR WIND SPRINTS,
LOSERS.

07:47.638 --> 07:50.100
COME ON.
(Andy and Travis groan)

07:53.103 --> 07:55.746
(panting)
I HAVEN'T HURT THIS BAD

07:55.746 --> 07:59.109
SINCE I HAD TO PUSH MY
CHILDHOOD HOME TO A GAS STATION.

07:59.109 --> 08:01.582
I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING
TO STOP.

08:01.582 --> 08:02.913
(raspy voice) ANYTHING?

08:02.913 --> 08:06.857
AAH! ELLIE! YOU SCARED THE CRAP
OUT OF ME!

08:06.857 --> 08:08.859
WHY ARE YOU TALKING
LIKE THAT?

08:08.859 --> 08:10.691
(normal voice) SORE THROAT.

08:10.691 --> 08:15.265
MY ILLNESS HAS OPENED UP
A WHOLE NEW WORLD FOR ME.

08:15.265 --> 08:18.799
I LIE AROUND ALL DAY
WATCHING TV,

08:18.799 --> 08:21.201
SUCKING ON WINE-SICLES,

08:21.201 --> 08:23.073
NOT TRAINING.

08:23.073 --> 08:24.875
I CAN MAKE YOU LIKE ME.

08:24.875 --> 08:26.276
BUT...

08:26.276 --> 08:28.579
JULES NEEDS ME.

08:28.579 --> 08:30.581
I'M VERY CONTAGIOUS.

08:30.581 --> 08:33.513
ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS BREATHE ON YOU.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.215
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO...

08:35.215 --> 08:36.717
(whispers) IS LET ME.

08:38.749 --> 08:40.621
(imitates British accent)
THE TALENT HAS ARRIVED.

08:40.621 --> 08:42.292
I'M HERE FOR
MY WARDROBE FITTING.

08:42.292 --> 08:45.896
HMM. CHEERIO.

08:47.928 --> 08:50.561
(normal voice) OH, UH,
EXCUSE ME. UM... (chuckles)

08:50.561 --> 08:52.633
WHAT'S WITH ALL THE SNOW BIRDS?
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

08:52.633 --> 08:54.534
AM I IN THE RIGHT PLACE
FOR TURBO-T?

08:54.534 --> 08:55.936
THE, UH,
DEODORANT COMMERCIAL.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.307
DEODORANT?

08:57.307 --> 08:59.570
TURBO-T IS
A PRESCRIPTION GEL

08:59.570 --> 09:01.772
FOR MEN
WITH LOW TESTOSTERONE.

09:01.772 --> 09:04.875
YOU MUST BE GRAYSON.
I'M YOUR DIRECTOR.

09:04.875 --> 09:06.176
AND THAT LOVELY LADY
OVER THERE

09:06.176 --> 09:10.080
IS PLAYING
YOUR ROMANTIC CONQUEST.

09:10.080 --> 09:13.784
(Rizzle Kicks'
"Mama Do the Hump" playing)

09:13.784 --> 09:15.125
в™Є MAMA, WON'T YOU PLEASE
LET ME? в™Є

09:15.125 --> 09:16.326
в™Є MAMA,
WON'T YOU PLEASE, LET ME? в™Є

09:16.326 --> 09:17.858
в™Є MAMA, WON'T YOU PLEASE,
LET ME? в™Є

09:17.858 --> 09:19.590
в™Є MAMA,
WON'T YOU PLEASE, LET ME? в™Є

09:19.590 --> 09:22.833
(groans)

09:22.833 --> 09:26.937
в™Є YO, COMING IN WITH A SOUND
FRESHER THAN CUT GRASS в™Є
в™Є FUN STARTS в™Є

09:26.937 --> 09:28.769
в™Є SECOND THAT WE ENTER
IF YOU MUST ASK в™Є
в™Є RUSH PAST в™Є

09:28.769 --> 09:30.200
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ONE.

09:30.200 --> 09:31.702
THAT'S ONE.

09:31.702 --> 09:32.943
KISS THE GROUND!

09:32.943 --> 09:34.274
(strained voice) ONE!

09:34.274 --> 09:36.947
THAT CRUSTY OLD BASTARD'S
GONNA KILL ME.

09:36.947 --> 09:38.649
в™Є NOT CALL IT A NIGHT, LUV в™Є

09:38.649 --> 09:39.910
в™Є AND I MIGHT JUST JOIN
THE MILE HIGH CLUB в™Є

09:39.910 --> 09:42.052
(caps explode)

09:42.052 --> 09:43.614
в™Є COULDN'T GIVE
A FLYING (bleep) в™Є

09:43.614 --> 09:45.315
в™Є YEAH, LET ME TOUCH BACK DOWN в™Є

09:45.315 --> 09:49.159
BUT, SUGAR, IF I HAVE THE FLU,
I CAN'T RUN THE 5K.

09:49.159 --> 09:50.791
(raspy voice) EXACTLY.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.793
в™Є OTHER HALF JIVING,
I LOVE THAT SOUND в™Є

09:52.793 --> 09:54.725
(sobbing loudly)

09:54.725 --> 09:57.167
AAH! (sobs)

09:57.167 --> 09:59.870
I'M READY.

09:59.870 --> 10:01.331
TAKE ME INSIDE YOU.

10:01.331 --> 10:03.734
в™Є DO THE HUMP HUMP в™Є

10:03.734 --> 10:06.136
HAVE A LICK
OF MY LEFTOVERS.

10:08.709 --> 10:11.011
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER
I CAN KEEP THIS UP.

10:11.011 --> 10:14.244
DON'T YOU QUIT ON ME.
YOU'RE ALL I'VE GOT LEFT.

10:14.244 --> 10:15.846
(blows whistle)

10:15.846 --> 10:17.217
GREAT. LET'S CALL IT A DAY.

10:17.217 --> 10:19.189
WE'RE DONE WHEN I SAY
WE'RE DONE.

10:19.189 --> 10:21.151
(whines) COME ON, DAD,
WE'RE SO EXHAUSTED.

10:21.151 --> 10:23.293
AND MY THIGHS ARE
REALLY CHAFFED.

10:25.856 --> 10:29.099
(singsongy) HEY, HEY,
MAMA'S BOY, MAMA'S BOY.

10:29.099 --> 10:32.102
I BET YOU'RE GONNA CRY.

10:32.102 --> 10:34.865
SQUIRT OUT A FEW.
COME ON! CRY!

10:34.865 --> 10:37.067
ONE, TWO, THREE, CRY.

10:37.067 --> 10:40.671
ONE, TWO, THREE, CRY.

10:40.671 --> 10:42.212
(door closes)
BOBBY,

10:42.212 --> 10:45.045
I JUST CAME BY TO SAY...
(coughs) UGH!

10:45.045 --> 10:46.416
THIS HOUSE SMELLS LIKE

10:46.416 --> 10:49.019
SWEAT SOCKS FILLED WITH
BLEU CHEESE.

10:49.019 --> 10:50.280
IT WAS HIM.

10:50.280 --> 10:52.122
IT WAS ME.

10:52.122 --> 10:54.354
(raspy voice)
IT'S SO GREAT HERE, GRAYSON.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.226
YOU SHOULD JOIN US.

10:56.226 --> 10:57.788
COUGH-SICLE?

10:57.788 --> 10:59.659
(coughs and wheezes)

10:59.659 --> 11:01.161
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY, BOBBY.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.433
THE WARDROBE FITTING
FOR MY NEW COMMERCIAL

11:03.433 --> 11:04.965
WAS HUMILIATING!

11:04.965 --> 11:07.197
TURBO-T ISN'T A DEODORANT.

11:07.197 --> 11:10.971
IT'S AN UNDERARM CREAM FOR
MEN WITH LOW TESTOSTERONE.

11:10.971 --> 11:13.303
THEY HAD ME RIDING BIKES
WITH 60-YEAR-OLDS

11:13.303 --> 11:14.975
AND BEDDING HER.

11:14.975 --> 11:18.909
(high-pitched cackle)

11:18.909 --> 11:20.350
WHAT? IT WAS FUNNY.

11:20.350 --> 11:23.353
DUDE, BUDDY, I DIDN'T KNOW.

11:23.353 --> 11:26.987
I WAS HAPPY BARTENDING, AND THEN
YOU HAD TO GET MY HOPES UP.

11:26.987 --> 11:29.920
I'M NOT AN ACTOR.
I'M A JOKE.

11:29.920 --> 11:31.822
(door opens)

11:34.024 --> 11:35.695
CHICK IS AN ANIMAL.
(door closes)

11:35.695 --> 11:37.798
YOU GUYS ARE SO LUCKY
YOU'RE SICK.

11:37.798 --> 11:39.930
(raspy voice) IT WASN'T LUCK.

11:39.930 --> 11:41.231
YOU GUYS GOT SICK ON PURPOSE?!

11:41.231 --> 11:42.803
I'M TELLING JULES!

11:42.803 --> 11:46.406
(raspy voice) YOU'LL HAVE TO
GET OUT FIRST.

11:46.406 --> 11:49.339
GUYS? THIS IS NOT FUNNY.

11:50.811 --> 11:53.243
KNOCK IT OFF!
(hisses)

11:53.243 --> 11:55.946
NO! NO, I DON'T--LEAVE ME ALONE!
I DON'T WANT TO BE LIKE YOU!

11:55.946 --> 11:57.447
(hisses)
(shouts indistinctly)

11:57.447 --> 11:59.890
NO!

11:59.890 --> 12:03.423
A CELL PHONE COMMERCIAL?
WHY COULDN'T I HAVE GOTTEN THAT?
(TV playing indistinctly)

12:03.423 --> 12:06.226
I LOOK AMAZING
TALKING ON THE PHONE.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.358
(woman speaking indistinctly)

12:08.358 --> 12:10.861
(groans)

12:10.861 --> 12:12.062
YOU OKAY, BABE?

12:12.062 --> 12:13.503
NO, NO! DON'T TOUCH ME.

12:13.503 --> 12:15.235
EVERYTHING HURTS.

12:15.235 --> 12:18.108
JUST TURN THE LIGHTS OUT,
PLEASE.

12:18.108 --> 12:20.811
(turns off TV)

12:20.811 --> 12:22.072
(click)

12:24.074 --> 12:25.816
(air horn blows)

12:25.816 --> 12:27.177
5:00 A.M.!

12:27.177 --> 12:29.850
TRAINING TIME!

12:29.850 --> 12:31.882
WHERE ARE THE OTHER TURDS?

12:31.882 --> 12:33.483
THEY ALL GOT SICK
WITH ELLIE'S FLU.

12:33.483 --> 12:35.926
GOOD. THEY WERE
HOLDING US BACK.

12:35.926 --> 12:37.788
YOU KNOW, I'M PRETTY TIRED
TODAY, TOO, DAD.

12:37.788 --> 12:39.029
CAN WE JUST TAKE IT EASY?

12:39.029 --> 12:41.031
THAT SOUNDS LIKE LOSER TALK.

12:41.031 --> 12:42.292
NO, NO. I REALLY AM TIRED.

12:42.292 --> 12:44.034
FIVE, FOUR, THR--

12:44.034 --> 12:45.395
YOU POP ME
WITH THAT TOWEL AGAIN,

12:45.395 --> 12:47.037
AND I WILL CHOKE YOU
WITH IT.

12:47.037 --> 12:48.768
OH. I'M JUST TRYING TO--

12:48.768 --> 12:51.301
WELL, STOP!
THIS IS A HUGE MISTAKE!

12:51.301 --> 12:53.904
YOU'RE A BULLY AND YOU'RE
A HORRIBLE COACH!

12:53.904 --> 12:56.506
AND I WISH I'D NEVER ASKED YOU
TO HELP ME IN THE FIRST PLACE!

13:02.412 --> 13:04.284
WOW. THIS IS THE MOST CONSCIOUS
I'VE SEEN YOU ALL WEEK.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.817
I TRIED TO WAKE YOU UP
FIVE TIMES LAST NIGHT.

13:06.817 --> 13:08.388
WOULDN'T BUDGE.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.190
I HAD A FIGHT WITH MY DAD.

13:10.190 --> 13:13.393
I MEAN, THIS WHOLE TRAINING
THING HAS BEEN A HUGE BUST.

13:13.393 --> 13:16.196
BUT ON THE POSITIVE SIDE,
I DON'T HAVE TO RUN THE 5K.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.568
WHAT, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
RUN THE RACE?
WHAT'S THE POINT?

13:18.568 --> 13:21.571
JULES, THE REASON YOU STARTED
THIS WAS TO MOTIVATE YOUR DAD.

13:21.571 --> 13:23.904
SAY WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT
HIS COACHING METHODS,

13:23.904 --> 13:25.936
CHICK WAS DEFINITELY
MOTIVATED.

13:25.936 --> 13:27.908
BUT HE'S TOO MOTIVATED.
IT'S AWFUL.

13:27.908 --> 13:30.510
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY TOWEL SNAP
MARKS I HAVE ON MY ASS?

13:30.510 --> 13:33.043
I ACTUALLY DO. I COUNTED LAST
NIGHT WHEN YOU WOULDN'T WAKE UP.

13:33.043 --> 13:35.485
LOOK, I KNOW THINGS GOT HARD
WITH CHICK,

13:35.485 --> 13:38.248
BUT YOU WANTED TO CONVINCE HIM
NOT TO QUIT WHEN LIFE GOT TOUGH.

13:38.248 --> 13:39.850
RIGHT?
IF YOU BAIL ON THE RACE,

13:39.850 --> 13:42.522
IT'S NOT EXACTLY SETTING
A GREAT EXAMPLE.

13:42.522 --> 13:44.294
YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:44.294 --> 13:46.857
CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR?
YOU WANT ME TO CALL CHICK?

13:46.857 --> 13:48.859
NO. WILL YOU LIFT THAT GLASS
TO MY LIPS?

13:48.859 --> 13:51.061
MY ARMS ARE DEAD.

13:51.061 --> 13:52.362
SURE. HERE YOU GO.

13:52.362 --> 13:55.105
SIPPY-SIPPY.
MMM.

13:55.105 --> 13:57.167
HEY, G-MAN.

13:57.167 --> 14:00.140
I JUST HAD TO COME SAY
I'M SORRY.

14:00.140 --> 14:02.842
JUST GONNA WEAR THAT ROBE
EVERYWHERE, HUH?

14:02.842 --> 14:05.345
LOOK, MAN, I'M THE ONE
WHO NEEDS TO APOLOGIZE, OKAY?

14:05.345 --> 14:07.417
YOU WERE JUST TRYING
TO ENCOURAGE ME.

14:07.417 --> 14:09.849
BESIDES, I DON'T BELIEVE
I'M GONNA BE A MOVIE STAR

14:09.849 --> 14:12.983
ANY MORE THAN YOU BELIEVE YOU'RE
GONNA WIN A HEISMAN TROPHY.

14:12.983 --> 14:15.225
WHY CAN'T I WIN
A HEISMAN TROPHY?

14:15.225 --> 14:18.028
'CAUSE YOU HAVE TO...
BE A FOOTBALL PLAYER.

14:18.028 --> 14:19.389
IN COLLEGE.

14:19.389 --> 14:21.431
OH. PFFT. EXCUSES, EXCUSES.

14:21.431 --> 14:24.634
LOOK... MAYBE I GOT MY HEAD
IN THE CLOUDS,

14:24.634 --> 14:27.397
BUT THE SECOND YOU START LISTING
REASONS A DREAM WON'T HAPPEN,

14:27.397 --> 14:29.169
IT'S AS GOOD AS DEAD.

14:29.169 --> 14:31.241
YOU WANNA HEAR ANOTHER DREAM
OF MINE,

14:31.241 --> 14:33.203
ONE THAT I'VE NEVER
TOLD ANYONE?

14:33.203 --> 14:35.175
LET'S SEE.
I'M GONNA GO WITH...

14:35.175 --> 14:38.578
LIVE OUT THE PLOT OF
ANY BURT REYNOLDS MOVIE.

14:38.578 --> 14:41.381
IT'S TO GET MARRIED AGAIN.

14:41.381 --> 14:44.014
AND I KNOW I'M--I'M BROKE

14:44.014 --> 14:45.515
AND I LIVE ON A BOAT
IN A PARKING LOT,

14:45.515 --> 14:48.058
BUT I'D RATHER HAVE
A FAR-FETCHED DREAM

14:48.058 --> 14:50.120
THAN NO DREAM AT ALL.

14:50.120 --> 14:52.592
THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.224
I MEAN, I JUST WISH
I DIDN'T GET PICKED

14:54.224 --> 14:56.566
FOR SUCH AN EMBARRASSING
PRODUCT.

14:56.566 --> 14:58.368
BUDDY,
THEY PICKED YOU BECAUSE

14:58.368 --> 15:01.601
YOU'RE THE YOUNG STUD THAT
ALL THOSE OLD DUDES WANNA BE.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.473
SO I SAY GO IN THERE

15:03.473 --> 15:06.236
AND SHOW 'EM WHAT
REAL TESTOSTERONE LOOKS LIKE.

15:06.236 --> 15:07.507
YEAH!
YEAH!

15:07.507 --> 15:09.379
YEAH! I AM A STUD!
YEAH! (laughs)

15:09.379 --> 15:10.981
YEAH, YOU ARE!
NOW GO GET IT!

15:10.981 --> 15:13.213
ALL RIGHT!
(laughs)

15:13.213 --> 15:14.684
SHOOT'S NOT FOR, LIKE,
AN HOUR,

15:14.684 --> 15:17.547
SO I'LL PROBABLY JUST
HANG HERE UNTIL I GOTTA GO.

15:17.547 --> 15:19.149
DAD, ARE YOU HERE?

15:32.402 --> 15:35.035
HOW'D YOU KNOW I WAS HERE?

15:35.035 --> 15:37.067
BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE
I WOULD COME AS A KID

15:37.067 --> 15:39.339
WHENEVER WE'D
GET INTO A FIGHT.

15:39.339 --> 15:43.273
AND... YOU'D FIND ME
AND GIVE ME A BIG HUG.

15:43.273 --> 15:45.075
AND YOU'D SPIN ME AROUND,

15:45.075 --> 15:47.617
AND ALL MY PROBLEMS
WOULD GO AWAY.

15:47.617 --> 15:49.219
I'M SORRY I BLEW UP AT YOU.

15:49.219 --> 15:51.151
I'M SORRY I WAS SO ROUGH
ON YOU.

15:51.151 --> 15:53.483
I WAS EXCITED AT GETTING
TO COACH AGAIN.

15:53.483 --> 15:56.987
AND I... GOT CARRIED AWAY.

15:56.987 --> 15:58.688
I FORGOT HOW TIGHT
YOU ROLL A TOWEL.

15:58.688 --> 16:04.594
ANY TIME I WAS EVER TOUGH
WITH YOU AS A COACH OR AS A DAD,

16:04.594 --> 16:08.138
IT WAS ONLY BECAUSE
I WANTED YOU TO SUCCEED.

16:08.138 --> 16:10.470
THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOU
SUCH A GREAT DAD.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.472
I MEAN,
YOU CAN BE TOUGH, BUT...

16:12.472 --> 16:16.446
I ALWAYS KNEW THAT YOU CARED.

16:16.446 --> 16:19.709
AND THAT'S WHY I WANTED
TO INSPIRE YOU,

16:19.709 --> 16:22.382
'CAUSE I'M NOT READY
TO LOSE YOU.

16:22.382 --> 16:25.655
HONEY, YOU DID INSPIRE ME.

16:25.655 --> 16:30.660
I NEEDED SOMEBODY TO SNAP ME OUT
OF THE FUNK I WAS IN,

16:30.660 --> 16:33.063
AND YOU DID.

16:33.063 --> 16:36.026
YOU DIDN'T GIVE UP ON ME,

16:36.026 --> 16:38.768
BECAUSE MY GIRL DOESN'T QUIT.

16:41.531 --> 16:43.773
YOU WANT A SPIN?

16:43.773 --> 16:46.336
(scoffs) YOU KNOW I DO.

16:51.581 --> 16:53.143
WHAT IS THIS, SUNDAY BRUNCH?

16:53.143 --> 16:54.444
(grunts)
GET THE LEAD OUT.

16:54.444 --> 16:56.316
(laughing)
LET'S GO!

16:56.316 --> 16:58.017
THERE YOU ARE.

17:01.791 --> 17:05.024
(nasal voice) BEING SICK
IS AMAZING. (wheezes)

17:05.024 --> 17:07.227
IT'S HOUR FIVE OF
THIS "TELETUBBIES" MARATHON,

17:07.227 --> 17:09.399
AND NOBODY CAN JUDGE US.

17:09.399 --> 17:12.302
GO TO SLEEP, TINKY-WINKY.
(door opens)

17:12.302 --> 17:14.464
WAIT. THAT'S ACTUALLY
A REALLY GOOD PET NAME.
(door closes)

17:14.464 --> 17:16.766
HEY, GUYS,
BROUGHT YOU SOME SOUP.

17:16.766 --> 17:19.038
WOW. THIS PLACE SMELLS LIKE
MY NANA'S HOUSE.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.671
SHE USED TO ALWAYS PERM HER HAIR
AND NEVER CLEANED THE CAT BOX.

17:21.671 --> 17:24.114
NO, I DON'T THINK
WE CAN SMELL ANYTHING.

17:24.114 --> 17:25.515
(nasal voice) HEY, JULES,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:25.515 --> 17:27.647
ELLIE WAS GETTING EVERYONE--OOF!

17:27.647 --> 17:29.219
I'M SO SORRY YOU'RE ALL SICK

17:29.219 --> 17:31.221
AND I CAN'T BE HERE
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU.

17:31.221 --> 17:34.084
I'LL PICK UP SOME FLU MEDICINE
ON THE WAY BACK FROM THE 5K.

17:34.084 --> 17:35.425
YOU'RE STILL GONNA
DO THE RUN?

17:35.425 --> 17:37.287
YEAH. I MEAN, TECHNICALLY,
I'M OFF THE HOOK,

17:37.287 --> 17:41.191
BUT I CAN'T EXACTLY PREACH TO MY
DAD ABOUT NOT QUITTING ON LIFE

17:41.191 --> 17:43.393
AND THEN QUIT
ON THIS LITTLE RACE.

17:43.393 --> 17:44.764
LOVE YOU, GUYS.

17:44.764 --> 17:46.236
WISH ME LUCK.

17:46.236 --> 17:47.737
(all) GOOD LUCK.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.243
(door closes)

17:54.604 --> 17:57.507
THERE'S A THESPIAN
IN THE BUILDING!

17:57.507 --> 18:01.251
I HOPE YOU PEOPLE ARE READY
TO SEE A TOUR DE FORCE,

18:01.251 --> 18:05.185
BECAUSE I'M HERE TO
ACT MY ASS OFF!

18:05.185 --> 18:08.188
(laughs) NOW WHICH ONE OF
YOU LITTLE PUNKS' JOB IS IT

18:08.188 --> 18:10.220
TO FETCH ME A SODA?

18:10.220 --> 18:11.761
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR
THE LOW TESTOSTERONE SPOT?

18:11.761 --> 18:13.863
YES, I AM.
THAT'S NEXT DOOR.

18:13.863 --> 18:16.166
IT'S... OH. GOT...

18:16.166 --> 18:18.698
(chuckles) OH! THANK YOU.
THAT'S...

18:18.698 --> 18:21.501
VERY KIND. (chuckles) NEXT DOOR.

18:21.501 --> 18:24.504
(Bear Mountain's "Congo"
playing)

18:24.504 --> 18:26.536
I'M PROUD OF YOU, HONEY.

18:26.536 --> 18:28.638
YOU SURE YOU FEEL UP TO THIS?
HELL, YEAH.

18:28.638 --> 18:31.341
NEXT TIME YOU SEE ME, I'LL BE
DASHING ACROSS THAT FINISH LINE.

18:31.341 --> 18:32.642
YEAH.

18:32.642 --> 18:34.184
(fires starter pistol)

18:34.184 --> 18:35.545
OH!

18:35.545 --> 18:38.648
(cheering)

18:38.648 --> 18:43.193
в™Єв™Єв™Є

18:43.193 --> 18:44.494
OH.

18:46.156 --> 18:48.698
IT'S OKAY, JULES.
YOU CAN DO THIS.

18:48.698 --> 18:50.730
IT ONLY FEELS LIKE
YOU GOT SHOT IN THE KNEE.

18:50.730 --> 18:52.832
в™Єв™Єв™Є

18:52.832 --> 18:55.235
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

18:55.235 --> 18:57.136
YOU'RE TOUGH, JULES,
BUT I KNOW YOU'RE HURTING.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.739
IT'S OKAY IF YOU WANT
TO SIT THIS OUT.

18:59.739 --> 19:01.341
NOT A CHANCE.
I'M NOT QUITTING.

19:01.341 --> 19:03.843
THAT'S MY GIRL.
THEN LET'S DO THIS.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.845
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU CAME
TO SUPPORT ME.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.417
(voice breaking) DON'T GET
ALL WEEPY ON ME.

19:07.417 --> 19:09.749
IF YOU START CRYING,
THEN I'M GONNA LOSE IT, TOO.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.351
(voice breaking)
I CAN'T HELP IT. I JUST--

19:11.351 --> 19:13.152
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.725
I LOVE YOU, TOO, JUNEBUG.
(cries)

19:15.725 --> 19:19.789
OH, CRAP. I CAN'T SEE
THROUGH THE TEARS IN MY EYES.

19:19.789 --> 19:21.891
(crash)
(crowd) AAH!

19:21.891 --> 19:23.863
KEEP GOING, JULES!

19:23.863 --> 19:26.296
YOU CAN DO IT!

19:26.296 --> 19:28.298
SUNSCREEN'S IN MY EYES!

19:28.298 --> 19:31.541
I'M BLIND!

19:31.541 --> 19:33.703
OH, MY GOD.

19:33.703 --> 19:35.605
I CAN SEE DEAD PEOPLE.

19:35.605 --> 19:37.607
GRANDPA?

19:37.607 --> 19:38.848
OH!

19:38.848 --> 19:40.410
OH! OHH!

19:40.410 --> 19:41.681
(grunts) COME ON,
WE CAN DO IT, J-BIRD!

19:41.681 --> 19:43.253
(groans) HANG IN THERE, MOM.

19:43.253 --> 19:44.614
(Jules groans)

19:44.614 --> 19:47.387
в™Єв™Єв™Є

19:47.387 --> 19:49.959
(panting)

19:49.959 --> 19:52.722
OHH. OH! ELLIE.

19:52.722 --> 19:55.295
TATER TOT.
(chuckles)

19:55.295 --> 19:56.926
YOU'RE ALL HERE!

19:56.926 --> 19:58.668
WHOSE HAND IS ON MY ASS?

19:58.668 --> 20:00.570
JUST TRYING TO HELP WITH
THE GLUTES.
OH.

20:00.570 --> 20:04.504
SWEETIE, I'M SO SORRY
WE WEREN'T HERE ALL ALONG.

20:04.504 --> 20:07.577
IT'S OKAY.
I'M JUST GLAD IT'S OVER.

20:07.577 --> 20:09.379
I FEEL DELIRIOUS.

20:09.379 --> 20:12.582
SO IF I CONFESS TO YOU THAT
I GOT EVERYBODY SICK ON PURPOSE,

20:12.582 --> 20:14.213
YOU MIGHT NOT REMEMBER?

20:14.213 --> 20:16.816
IT'S OKAY.
I'M JUST GLAD IT'S OVER.

20:16.816 --> 20:18.648
I FEEL DELIRIOUS.

20:18.648 --> 20:20.720
LET'S GET HER SOME FLUIDS.
(Bobby) ALL RIGHT.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.222
OH, NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, NO. LET'S GET YOU...

20:25.395 --> 20:27.257
(jazz playing)
(man) MOODY? LOW ENERGY?

20:27.257 --> 20:28.858
TROUBLE MAINTAINING
AN ERECTION?

20:28.858 --> 20:31.901
YOU MAY HAVE
LOW TESTOSTERONE.

20:31.901 --> 20:34.534
LOW TESTOSTERONE CAN AFFECT

20:34.534 --> 20:36.936
ALL AREAS OF YOUR LIFE.

20:36.936 --> 20:39.339
BUT TURBO-T GEL, USED DAILY,

20:39.339 --> 20:40.710
CAN SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY

20:40.710 --> 20:42.241
ELEVATE
YOUR TESTOSTERONE LEVELS...

20:42.241 --> 20:44.874
ON THE COURT

20:44.874 --> 20:46.976
AND EVERYWHERE ELSE.

20:46.976 --> 20:50.550
BOOST YOUR ENERGY,
RAISE YOUR PERFORMANCE,

20:50.550 --> 20:52.782
PUT THE BANG BACK IN YOUR GAME

20:52.782 --> 20:54.954
WITH TURBO-T.
