00:00.333 --> 00:03.369
            I want to sanction
            you off the books.

00:03.371 --> 00:05.738
            I'll supply you
            with whatever
            resources you need.

00:05.740 --> 00:08.774
Did joe try to contact
anyone while he was here?

00:08.776 --> 00:11.076
    All I know is she was
    a friend in the fbi.

00:11.078 --> 00:13.012
            You made me give up
            the fbi.

00:13.014 --> 00:14.179
Please, jana.

00:14.181 --> 00:15.447
Carroll, voice-over:
Tell me about korban.

00:15.449 --> 00:17.616
            Korban? Well,
            it's still there

00:17.618 --> 00:18.584
            As far as I know.

00:18.586 --> 00:19.985
        I know out in the world
        you're a big deal

00:19.987 --> 00:21.887
        With a killer cult
        and a bunch
        of followers,

00:21.889 --> 00:24.256
        But in here,
        you're the follower.

00:24.258 --> 00:25.991
            I need your help.

00:25.993 --> 00:27.726
            I want
            to kill people.

00:27.728 --> 00:30.963
        You're the reporter
        that's writing the book.

00:30.965 --> 00:31.897
Carrie cooke.

00:31.899 --> 00:34.066
I think there's
a bigger story here,

00:34.068 --> 00:35.067
And it's all mine.

00:35.069 --> 00:37.169
With or without you,
I'm gonna find lily gray.

00:37.171 --> 00:40.139
You tell me.
What are you gonna do
when you find joe?

00:40.141 --> 00:42.708
Revenge doesn't
fix anything. I know.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.943
            But you're
            here anyway.

00:44.945 --> 00:45.744
        Aagh!

00:45.746 --> 00:47.079
            You're ok. Hang on.

00:47.081 --> 00:48.414
[wheezing]

00:48.416 --> 00:49.982
Thank you.

00:49.984 --> 00:51.216
            This is god's will.

00:51.218 --> 00:52.818
You abused your power,
micah.

00:52.820 --> 00:53.919
You killed
your own people!

00:53.921 --> 00:56.321
Why didn't you tell me
that you were doing this?

00:56.323 --> 00:57.523
            I love you
            too much, julia.

00:57.525 --> 00:58.724
            I don't want to
            lose you.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.159
            Take her away,
            take her away.

01:00.161 --> 01:01.593
    Micah, no, no, no.

01:01.595 --> 01:03.729
It's time we tell
the whole world

01:03.731 --> 01:07.266
That joe carroll
is alive.

01:09.335 --> 01:10.536
        Anyone looking
        for an update

01:10.538 --> 01:12.237
    On the murderous rampage
        of lily gray

01:12.239 --> 01:14.406
    Need to look no further
    than our very own reporter

01:14.408 --> 01:17.943
    And best-selling author
    of "the havenport tragedy"

01:17.945 --> 01:18.710
        Carrie cooke.

01:18.712 --> 01:19.812
        Carrie: Good morning,
        everyone.

01:19.814 --> 01:21.413
            Ah. Good morning,
            miss cooke.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.916
This carrie cooke
is all over the news.

01:23.918 --> 01:26.251
She's making a lot
of money off you.

01:26.253 --> 01:27.853
            Well, I suppose
            someone should.

01:27.855 --> 01:29.388
...And her family
of psychopaths?

01:29.390 --> 01:32.324
        Lily gray suffers
        from a loss of identity.

01:32.326 --> 01:33.759
        She was an abused orphan

01:33.761 --> 01:35.060
        Adopted
        by a wealthy man,

01:35.062 --> 01:38.097
        Raised in a privileged
        world she could
        never belong to,

01:38.099 --> 01:40.132
        So she created
        her own family.

01:40.134 --> 01:42.768
Hmm. And how does
joe carroll fit
into this?

01:42.770 --> 01:46.605
        Their murder spree
        has been a tribute
        to carroll's legacy,

01:46.607 --> 01:49.475
        But lily gray
        is creating
        her own legacy.

01:49.477 --> 01:51.844
        Her psychopathy is
        much more complicated

01:51.846 --> 01:53.779
        Than carroll's ever was.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.080
Micah: Yes! Her!
Lily gray!

01:55.082 --> 01:57.149
She's the perfect example.
She's huge.

01:57.151 --> 01:59.852
I want to make a splash
like she has.

01:59.854 --> 02:01.720
            I made a splash,
            micah.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.922
Yes, of course you did
back then,

02:03.924 --> 02:05.991
But she's
in the news now.

02:05.993 --> 02:08.227
You're dead, remember?

02:08.229 --> 02:09.828
            Heh.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.930
            You got a phone
            I could use?

02:11.932 --> 02:13.332
Yes. Who you gonna call?

02:13.334 --> 02:15.601
            Well, if you want
            to make a splash,

02:15.603 --> 02:17.836
            You're gonna need
            help in that,

02:17.838 --> 02:19.838
            And I have this
            contact who has

02:19.840 --> 02:21.306
            Proven most
            resourceful

02:21.308 --> 02:24.376

            such as these.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.068
Joe, are you ok?

02:50.070 --> 02:51.303
            Yes, yes. Fine.

02:51.305 --> 02:54.206
            Jana, it appears
            that I might be

02:54.208 --> 02:57.142
            Needing your help
            again.

03:03.349 --> 03:06.351
Carrie: I didn't mention
anything about strauss
or joe carroll.

03:06.353 --> 03:09.321
I talked mainly
about lily gray.

03:09.323 --> 03:10.722
So what do you
have for me?

03:10.724 --> 03:11.790
        Strauss is being held

03:11.792 --> 03:13.425
        At an nsa terrorist
        unit downtown.

03:13.427 --> 03:14.960
        They've sent specialists
        from d.C.

03:14.962 --> 03:17.496
        In the process
        of interrogating
        him right now.

03:17.498 --> 03:20.098
        That's all I know.

03:20.100 --> 03:21.433
And what about
joe carroll?

03:21.435 --> 03:23.535
        I haven't found
        him yet.

03:23.537 --> 03:26.405
But you'll notify me
the second you
know something.

03:26.407 --> 03:27.539
        Or the second after.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.741
That's the way
this works, ryan.

03:29.743 --> 03:30.776
I keep my mouth shut,

03:30.778 --> 03:33.412
But you feed me
the bigger story.

03:33.414 --> 03:35.414

03:35.416 --> 03:38.050
Let's have dinner
tonight.

03:39.886 --> 03:40.652
            I can't.

03:40.654 --> 03:44.289
You can't,
or you won't?

03:44.291 --> 03:46.725
It's just dinner.

03:46.727 --> 03:50.095
            I doubt dinner is
            ever just dinner
            with you.

03:50.097 --> 03:52.397
Now you're paranoid.

03:52.399 --> 03:53.999
You saved my life.

03:54.001 --> 03:55.500
Can't I buy you
dinner?

03:55.502 --> 03:57.803
Does it sound
that crazy?

03:57.805 --> 04:01.206
            Uh, yeah, it does.

04:01.208 --> 04:04.309
            I'll call you if

            Ok. Well, uh, you
            should have said
            something.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.922
Yeah. I was going to,
and then your phone rang,

04:50.924 --> 04:52.491
And you answered it,
and it was your mother,

04:52.493 --> 04:53.659
So I--I waited,

04:53.661 --> 04:55.027
But then you dropped
your towel,

04:55.029 --> 04:56.762
And things got creepy.

04:56.764 --> 04:57.629
            Creepy?

04:57.631 --> 04:58.530
Yeah, creepy because

04:58.532 --> 04:59.865
You're on the phone
with your mother,

04:59.867 --> 05:01.900
And it's--you're naked.
It's weird.

05:01.902 --> 05:02.868
Where's ryan?

05:02.870 --> 05:04.002
        He went to go meet
        carrie cooke,

05:04.004 --> 05:06.071
        And you're the only
        one here acting weird.

05:06.073 --> 05:08.974
            Ok. Sorry.
            Uh...Ahem.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.276
            Let's start over.

05:14.380 --> 05:16.648
            I brought coffee.

05:18.618 --> 05:20.585
            How are you?

05:21.721 --> 05:24.156
I don't know.

05:25.191 --> 05:28.160
I'm ok, I guess.

05:28.162 --> 05:31.697
Thank you for asking.

05:31.699 --> 05:33.765
        I may have something
        on the fbi leak.

05:33.767 --> 05:36.034
        Ryan forwarded me
        a report from franklin

05:36.036 --> 05:38.070
        With info on all
        female agents

05:38.072 --> 05:39.571
        With possible access.

05:39.573 --> 05:40.672
How extensive is
the list?

05:40.674 --> 05:42.641
        2,663 names,
        but we can eliminate

05:42.643 --> 05:44.509
        90% simply by
        access and intel.

05:44.511 --> 05:45.844
Ok. What if you
cross referenced

05:45.846 --> 05:47.279
The agents' caseloads
and locals

05:47.281 --> 05:49.381
With carroll-related
incidents in the past year

05:49.383 --> 05:50.882
When the security
breach happened?

05:50.884 --> 05:51.817
            Way ahead of you.

05:51.819 --> 05:53.151
            Narrowed it
            to 6 women.

05:53.153 --> 05:54.019
            -6?
            -Yeah.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.787
            Keep in mind this
            is a rush job,

05:55.789 --> 06:00.726
            It's inaccurate,
            unfounded, and...

06:00.728 --> 06:03.762
            There's a lot
            of room for error.

06:19.078 --> 06:21.246
    It is time for the world
        to realize

06:21.248 --> 06:23.815
    That the beginning is near,

06:23.817 --> 06:26.118
        Um, the beginning
        of the end,

06:26.120 --> 06:30.455
    For the alpha and omega
        are upon us.

06:30.457 --> 06:31.656
    Cut. That's not right.

06:31.658 --> 06:32.858
    I messed up again, joe.

06:32.860 --> 06:36.094
            Yeah. It's, uh, it's
            "the end is near,"

06:36.096 --> 06:38.163
            Not--not
            "the beginning,"

06:38.165 --> 06:39.998
            And alpha and omega
            is the beginning

06:40.000 --> 06:43.201
            And the end,
            not the beginning

06:43.203 --> 06:45.704
            Of the end.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.773
            Do you want to take
            another look

06:47.775 --> 06:48.774
            Over the lines,
            or...

06:48.776 --> 06:50.509
        I'm better
    when I just feel it.

06:50.511 --> 06:54.546
            Yeah. Right. I'm--
            I'm sure you are.

07:13.767 --> 07:16.668
        We've gone over it
        again and again.

            Oh, one last thing.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.938
            I've decided
            to add lance.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.807
            He'll be very
            helpful.

07:21.809 --> 07:25.210
Yeah. I-I-I'm sorry.
Lance? Who's lance?

07:25.212 --> 07:27.546
            I told you you're
            not the first killer

07:27.548 --> 07:29.748
            To seek
            shelter here.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.216
            You're gonna love
            lance,

07:31.218 --> 07:32.717
            And he's
            superexcited to get

07:32.719 --> 07:33.685
            Out of the hole.

07:33.687 --> 07:35.053
Why's he still
down the hole?

07:35.055 --> 07:36.721
            He was serving
            penance ever since

07:36.723 --> 07:38.290
            He sliced
            a girl's ear off

07:38.292 --> 07:39.791
            6 months ago.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.260
    A girl here?

07:42.262 --> 07:43.061
    What did she do?

07:43.063 --> 07:44.930
            He didn't like
            the way she looked.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.264
            He was making
            a point.

07:46.266 --> 07:48.767
            Trust me. Lance is
            perfect to accompany

07:48.769 --> 07:50.368
            You two to new york,

07:50.370 --> 07:52.904
            And he's very
            devoted to me.

07:52.906 --> 07:54.139
            Oh! The weapons!

07:54.141 --> 07:55.540
            Can't forget those.

07:55.542 --> 07:57.709
            Come on, robert.

07:58.044 --> 08:00.545
            Come on.
            Come with me.

08:02.582 --> 08:04.282
I--I think I've
just about had

08:04.284 --> 08:06.051
My fill of micah.

08:06.053 --> 08:07.719
Uh--lance?

08:07.721 --> 08:11.690
I do not like
surprises.

08:11.692 --> 08:12.858
            How crazy is he?

08:12.860 --> 08:15.093
Oh. Bipolar, delusional.

08:15.095 --> 08:18.296
I'm seeing strong signs
of disassociative
identity disorder,

08:18.298 --> 08:20.165
But then what do I know?

08:20.167 --> 08:22.834
I'm not a doctor.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.269
Do you really want
to do this?

08:24.271 --> 08:27.205
            There's no one else
            to do it.

08:28.674 --> 08:30.675
            Don't worry.

08:30.677 --> 08:31.910
            I'm not the same
            little girl

08:31.912 --> 08:34.679
            You remember
            from a year ago.

08:36.883 --> 08:39.417
            It'll be dangerous.

08:39.419 --> 08:41.152
So am I.

08:43.222 --> 08:45.357
            Yes, you are.

08:45.359 --> 08:47.092
            Ryan: I don't
            believe it.

08:47.094 --> 08:48.827
            My gut tells me
            she's innocent.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.529
        Her security codes
    were used 6 times last year

08:50.531 --> 08:51.930
        To access
    debra parker's e-mail.

08:51.932 --> 08:53.565
        Are we absolutely
        certain about this?

08:53.567 --> 08:56.334
    Nothing is certain here.
    I'm a little limited,

08:56.336 --> 08:58.036
    But maybe 80% sure.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.838
            Mike: She did
            her dissertation
            on carroll

08:59.840 --> 09:01.072
            At the academy.

09:01.074 --> 09:02.007
        So did you.

09:02.009 --> 09:03.341
        What do we know
    about her personal life?

09:03.343 --> 09:05.777
She's been separated
just over a year

09:05.779 --> 09:08.413
From jana murphy,
a retired fbi analyst.

09:08.415 --> 09:09.648
            -A woman.
            -Yeah.

09:09.650 --> 09:10.582
            I didn't know.

09:10.584 --> 09:12.117
            Max: They have
            two kids together.

09:12.119 --> 09:12.951
        Where is she?

09:12.953 --> 09:14.185
    Stay-at-home mom
    in the suburbs.

09:14.187 --> 09:15.720
    She's been inactive
    since the first kid.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.122
But truth is,
we don't know anything

09:17.124 --> 09:18.523
About mendez
beyond the file.

09:18.525 --> 09:22.193
If she's innocent,
let's prove it.

09:23.996 --> 09:25.797
    I'm 10 minutes away.

09:25.799 --> 09:27.966
        Had to run home
        and shower.

09:27.968 --> 09:30.168
        All right.
    I'll be right there.

09:30.170 --> 09:31.570
        Oh!

09:31.572 --> 09:33.605
        Sorry.

09:33.607 --> 09:36.408
        Oh. Just--
        you know what?

09:36.410 --> 09:38.944
    Let me call you back.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.078
Hi, gina.

09:40.080 --> 09:40.912
            Hey, ryan.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.080
            What are you
            doing here?

09:42.082 --> 09:43.515
I was hoping
we could talk.

09:43.517 --> 09:45.150
            Well, franklin said
            that you were out,

09:45.152 --> 09:46.518
            So what's this
            about?

09:46.520 --> 09:47.586
            Is it mike?
            Is he ok?

09:47.588 --> 09:50.322
I pulled your
security clearance.

09:50.324 --> 09:52.490
Why do you have
personal firewalls

09:52.492 --> 09:53.758
On your passcodes?

09:53.760 --> 09:55.026
            For protection.

09:55.028 --> 09:56.094
            Tread lightly, ryan.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.096
Why did you access
debra parker's e-mail account

09:58.098 --> 10:01.099
6 times last year?

10:01.101 --> 10:03.435
            I did no such thing.

10:03.437 --> 10:05.670
        Look. You're on
        a fishing expedition,

10:05.672 --> 10:06.805
        And it's not gonna work

10:06.807 --> 10:07.906
        Because I'm
        not the leak.

10:07.908 --> 10:10.909
        How dare you question
        my loyalty.

10:10.911 --> 10:13.211
        Go to hell.

10:25.558 --> 10:27.692
What's she doing?

10:28.361 --> 10:31.930
            She's at her car,

10:31.932 --> 10:33.264
            And she's mad.

10:33.266 --> 10:34.466
            What'd you say
            to her?

10:34.468 --> 10:37.569
I went for it.
I accused her.

10:46.012 --> 10:48.079
Mike: She just ditched
her cell.

10:48.081 --> 10:50.181
            Max: She's still
            wearing my trace.

10:50.183 --> 10:52.784
I got it.
Nicely done.

10:52.786 --> 10:54.519
            Thank you.

11:10.002 --> 11:12.504
            She's ditching
            her car.

11:18.644 --> 11:24.215
            She's paranoid,
            and she's heading
            towards you.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.551
        Guess I was wrong.

11:27.553 --> 11:30.055
        That's too bad.

11:42.201 --> 11:44.602
            Robert, I want
            you to take care
            of emma for me.

11:44.604 --> 11:47.005
Don't you think it's
the other way around?

11:47.007 --> 11:49.040
            Heh heh.

11:49.742 --> 11:51.009
So what did you
tell mandy?

11:51.011 --> 11:52.944
I'm keeping her
in the dark for now.

11:52.946 --> 11:54.946
She's prone to worry.

11:54.948 --> 11:57.382
You ready for this?

11:57.384 --> 12:00.051
            Go big or go home.

12:07.293 --> 12:08.393
            Something wrong?

12:08.395 --> 12:12.697
No. It's just your...
Timing.

12:12.699 --> 12:14.666
    Lance, meet everyone.

12:14.668 --> 12:18.136
This is joe,
robert, emma.

12:20.372 --> 12:24.909
Hi. Can I have
the backseat?

12:26.912 --> 12:28.847
            Sure.

12:30.549 --> 12:33.084
        Oh, uh, don't forget
        micah's message.

12:33.086 --> 12:36.287
        He, uh, he finished it.

12:36.289 --> 12:39.457
            Well, you kids
            have fun!

12:47.867 --> 12:50.034
So lance is a freak.

12:50.036 --> 12:52.537
            I agree.

12:52.539 --> 12:55.273
            So, uh...

12:55.275 --> 12:58.810
            You and joe
            are a thing?

12:58.812 --> 13:01.246
It's complicated.

13:02.948 --> 13:04.883
Don't look disappointed.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.151
            No. I...

13:06.153 --> 13:07.619
If it's any consolation,

13:07.621 --> 13:11.422
I don't believe
in relationships.

13:11.424 --> 13:14.559
Someone always
ends up dead.

13:29.975 --> 13:30.842
            Hi, mom!

13:30.844 --> 13:33.812
                Hey, sweetie.
                Mmm.

13:33.814 --> 13:34.946
            Where's your mom?

13:34.948 --> 13:37.882
                In there!
                Bye, mom!

13:43.489 --> 13:46.224
        Gina, hey.

13:46.226 --> 13:47.025
Hey, lisa.

13:47.027 --> 13:48.459
            This is
        a nice surprise.

13:48.461 --> 13:50.728
Hey, sweetie.

13:50.730 --> 13:51.830
    Do you know carol?

13:51.832 --> 13:53.398
No, I don't.
It's nice to meet you.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.432
Where's jana?

13:54.434 --> 13:58.269
        Oh. The new blond
        in the house.

13:58.271 --> 14:00.605
Ahh. Oh!

14:00.607 --> 14:03.141
Do we have something
scheduled that I forgot?

14:03.143 --> 14:05.610
        No. I just needed
        to talk to you.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.912
There's a little thing
called a telephone.

14:07.914 --> 14:10.648
        It'll only take
        a minute.

14:10.650 --> 14:13.585
    Lisa: Should we go?

14:13.587 --> 14:17.422
Of course not.
Who needs more wine?

14:17.424 --> 14:19.023
Here you guys go.

14:19.025 --> 14:21.926
Kids! Pizza!

14:21.928 --> 14:23.328
            I really need
            to talk to you.

14:23.330 --> 14:27.932
What is it?
Pizza! Come and get it!

14:29.268 --> 14:33.638
Spit it out.
I have company.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.707
            Alone.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.851
            [sighs]

14:53.192 --> 14:55.226
            Oh.

14:55.228 --> 14:58.029
            I've been praying

14:58.031 --> 15:00.198
            About julia.

15:00.200 --> 15:03.201
Oh. I see.

15:03.203 --> 15:06.838
            I was seeking
            guidance.

15:06.840 --> 15:08.406
        Did you get any?

15:08.408 --> 15:10.975
I love her, joe.

15:10.977 --> 15:13.778
What do I do?

15:13.780 --> 15:14.946
            I killed my wife,

15:14.948 --> 15:18.750
        So probably not
        the best person to ask.

15:18.752 --> 15:22.020
        Not with my own hands,
        mind you,

15:22.022 --> 15:24.656
        But indirectly, hmm.

15:24.658 --> 15:28.126
Did you love her?

15:28.128 --> 15:31.396
            Heart and soul.

15:31.398 --> 15:33.831
            Claire is my--

15:33.833 --> 15:37.335
            She's my one
            true regret.

15:40.806 --> 15:42.974
I could never harm julia.

15:42.976 --> 15:46.311
            No, no.
            Of course not.

15:50.316 --> 15:52.917
            I understand.

15:56.989 --> 15:58.256
            Here's your pizza.

15:58.258 --> 16:00.625
        Are you done
        dodging me?

16:00.627 --> 16:03.328
I have company,
people I care about.

16:03.330 --> 16:06.331
Might not be your
fancy fbi world,

16:06.333 --> 16:07.565
But it matters to me.

16:07.567 --> 16:08.900
            Ok. Listen, jana.
            We need to have

16:08.902 --> 16:10.468
            A real conversation
            right now.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.637
Did you even notice
I colored my hair?

16:12.639 --> 16:14.906
            Jana, please.

16:14.908 --> 16:16.541
[sighs]

16:16.543 --> 16:17.508
Fine. What?

16:17.510 --> 16:18.977
            After andrea
            was born

16:18.979 --> 16:20.578
            And you had
            your episode--

16:20.580 --> 16:22.814
Why are you
bringing that up?

16:22.816 --> 16:25.316
It was
postpartum depression.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.719
Women who give up
their careers

16:27.721 --> 16:30.855
To have children
sometimes experience that.

16:30.857 --> 16:32.991
            We called it that
            because of work.

16:32.993 --> 16:35.727
            You had a psychotic
            break, jana.

16:35.729 --> 16:37.061
            You were
            hospitalized.

16:37.063 --> 16:40.898
I had an emotional reaction
to childbirth.

16:40.900 --> 16:42.667
            You killed
            the neighbor's dog.

16:42.669 --> 16:45.770
It was a vicious,
unstable dog!

16:45.772 --> 16:49.674
It was attacking everyone
in the neighborhood!

16:50.709 --> 16:54.045
            Oh, god.

16:54.047 --> 16:58.016
            Oh, jana.
            You're not ok.

16:58.018 --> 16:59.784
I am ok.

16:59.786 --> 17:02.120
            Joe carroll?

17:02.122 --> 17:04.155
            I know.

17:04.156 --> 17:05.823
            You were obsessed
            with him.

17:05.825 --> 17:07.290
            You were obsessed
            with carroll.

17:07.292 --> 17:08.893
With--with the case.

17:08.895 --> 17:10.428
Everyone was back then.

17:10.430 --> 17:11.863
Why are you bringing
this up?

17:11.865 --> 17:16.501
        You have been using
        my security clearance!

17:16.502 --> 17:20.570
Ok. You know what?
I'm not doing this.

17:20.573 --> 17:21.571
We're done.

17:21.574 --> 17:22.773
            You're done?

17:22.776 --> 17:25.076
Yes!

17:25.078 --> 17:28.445
            Oh, god!

17:28.448 --> 17:30.048
            You know what?

17:30.050 --> 17:32.016
You ruined my life once,

17:32.018 --> 17:35.753
But you're not gonna
do it again.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.722
            Unh!

            -Yeah!

Are you ok?
Where's gina?

18:26.773 --> 18:32.076
            Oh. She is
            in the garage
            cooling off.

18:32.078 --> 18:35.813
            I had no idea
            she was showing
            up today.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.081
            I'm so sorry,
            you guys.

18:37.083 --> 18:38.049

18:38.051 --> 18:40.418
        Um, I have to
        run upstairs
        for a minute.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.887
    Can you just watch
    billy for me?

18:42.889 --> 18:43.855
        Great.

            of gina's.

Hmm. And I'm married
sadly.

19:30.637 --> 19:32.403
Sorry. Day drinking.

19:32.405 --> 19:33.905
            You said she was
            in the garage?

19:33.907 --> 19:35.039
            Which way is that?

19:35.041 --> 19:36.807

            where he is?

    Yes, ryan, I know.

            Where's joe?

        The world is
        falling apart,

    And all you can say
    is, "where's joe?"

    It doesn't matter...

22:24.410 --> 22:25.409
            How do you think?

22:25.411 --> 22:28.045
        I've been locked in
        a cabin by my husband.

22:28.047 --> 22:30.314
        The world that I spent
        my life creating

22:30.316 --> 22:33.017
        Has shunned me.

22:36.455 --> 22:38.322
        What the hell did you
        tell everyone?

22:38.324 --> 22:42.693
The truth,
that you defied me
and our beliefs.

22:42.695 --> 22:43.728
        You defied our beliefs,

22:43.730 --> 22:44.895
        Everything that
        we stand for.

22:44.897 --> 22:46.697
        You have gone way
        beyond the realm

22:46.699 --> 22:49.367
Ok. So I was hoping to have
a rational conversation,

22:49.369 --> 22:51.669
But if you're just
gonna call me crazy again--

22:51.671 --> 22:53.704
        Joe carroll is
        manipulating you.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.239
        How do you not see that?

22:55.241 --> 22:59.210
He's helping me.
To find my true self.

22:59.212 --> 23:02.380
How do you know he's not
a prophet that's been sent

23:02.382 --> 23:03.881
Here to guide us?

23:03.883 --> 23:06.050
        We're not killers.

23:06.052 --> 23:07.585
        You're not a killer.

23:07.587 --> 23:09.487
I have killed.

23:09.489 --> 23:12.723
Have I not hurt people
in the name of korban?

23:12.725 --> 23:15.359
        But you channeled
        the spirit.

23:15.361 --> 23:16.727
        That's completely
        different.

        We're not monsters.
        You and I,
        we have faith.

to believe in me.

to us, julia?

            Why did you do this?

24:18.724 --> 24:19.857
Because I had to

24:19.859 --> 24:22.827
            Test your faith.

24:22.829 --> 24:26.964

        off of her computer.

        it to max,

    With the sacrifice of blood,

    death is no longer revered.

34:10.849 --> 34:16.820
        Well, I have come
    to restore that reverence.

34:16.822 --> 34:20.456
        In the coming days,
    more blood will be spilled,
