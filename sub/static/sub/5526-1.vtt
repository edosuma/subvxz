00:35.536 --> 00:37.913
(music playing)

00:37.955 --> 00:40.374
Hey, yo, that's the, uh,

00:37.955 --> 00:40.374
food, oh? Go grab that.

00:40.415 --> 00:41.792
Give me the money.

00:43.293 --> 00:45.546
Go grab

00:43.293 --> 00:45.546
that, man.

00:45.587 --> 00:47.422
What 'bout Chris?

00:45.587 --> 00:47.422
He in the bathroom.

00:47.464 --> 00:48.757
That's your

00:47.464 --> 00:48.757
cousin.

00:48.799 --> 00:49.758
He's not my blood.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.519
You back again?

01:00.561 --> 01:01.937
How much money

01:00.561 --> 01:01.937
you trying to lose?

01:01.979 --> 01:03.022
None.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.025
(groans)

01:31.258 --> 01:32.217
No.

01:42.477 --> 01:44.396
(alarm clock ringing)

01:51.862 --> 01:53.864
RADIO D.J.: Wake up, Little Joe

01:51.862 --> 01:53.864
here. Rise and shine.

01:53.906 --> 01:55.407
It's your host

01:53.906 --> 01:55.407
with the most.

01:55.449 --> 01:56.992
JACKIE: This is my

01:55.449 --> 01:56.992
older brother, Eric,

01:57.034 --> 02:00.161
but we call him June,

01:57.034 --> 02:00.161
short for Junior.

02:00.203 --> 02:02.873
He's been taking care of us

02:00.203 --> 02:02.873
ever since our dad died.

02:02.915 --> 02:04.374
He thought he was gonna

02:02.915 --> 02:04.374
be a ballplayer

02:04.416 --> 02:07.544
but life had other plans.

02:07.586 --> 02:08.836
Our dad used to say,

02:08.878 --> 02:11.715
"We do what we have to do."

02:11.757 --> 02:15.052
Well, he's been holding down

02:11.757 --> 02:15.052
at our house since he was 15.

02:16.887 --> 02:21.600
("Lovely Day,"

02:16.887 --> 02:21.600
by Jill Scott, playing)

02:27.689 --> 02:29.817
JUNE: Serg, get up,

02:27.689 --> 02:29.817
you know what it is.

02:29.858 --> 02:30.901
Time to go.

02:32.444 --> 02:34.154
Hey, I know

02:32.444 --> 02:34.154
you heard me.

02:38.199 --> 02:39.159
Get your ass up.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.120
SERGIO: Oh, man.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.163
JUNE: Hey, boy, you can't

02:41.161 --> 02:43.163
sleep your dreams down, man,

02:43.204 --> 02:45.165
you got to chase

02:43.204 --> 02:45.165
it. Get up, boy.

02:45.206 --> 02:47.501
Hey, I'm putting this money up

02:45.206 --> 02:47.501
here on the dresser, all right?

02:47.542 --> 02:50.838
JACKIE: His dreams are now in

02:47.542 --> 02:50.838
my twin brother, Sergio.

02:50.879 --> 02:53.715
Our mom says, Sergio's

02:50.879 --> 02:53.715
first word was "Kobe."

02:53.757 --> 02:55.383
Our dad was a musician,

02:55.425 --> 02:58.470
but he was the biggest

02:55.425 --> 02:58.470
76ers fan ever.

02:58.512 --> 03:01.056
Doc, Barkley, Iverson,

03:01.098 --> 03:02.850
they were our heroes.

03:02.891 --> 03:04.768
Sergio was ranked one

03:02.891 --> 03:04.768
of the top ten high school

03:04.810 --> 03:06.812
players in the nation.

03:11.525 --> 03:14.486
Which brings us to me, Jackie.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.404
JUNE: Wake up.

03:16.446 --> 03:19.908
6:00 and I don't wanna be

03:16.446 --> 03:19.908
in that bathroom all day.

03:19.950 --> 03:21.160
Jack, get up!

03:21.200 --> 03:22.285
JACKIE: I

03:21.200 --> 03:22.285
heard you.

03:22.327 --> 03:23.829
I'm up.

03:28.249 --> 03:30.585
I grew up listening

03:28.249 --> 03:30.585
to all the Philly greats,

03:30.627 --> 03:34.255
Jill Scott, Boyz II Men,

03:30.627 --> 03:34.255
Musiq Soulchild.

03:34.297 --> 03:37.092
Our dad used to play drums

03:34.297 --> 03:37.092
for a lot of those groups.

03:37.134 --> 03:40.637
When I was a kid I used to sit

03:37.134 --> 03:40.637
in on some of the sessions.

03:40.679 --> 03:43.306
I've been hooked

03:40.679 --> 03:43.306
on music ever since.

03:43.348 --> 03:45.308
("Lovely Day,"

03:43.348 --> 03:45.308
by Jill Scott, playing)

03:50.438 --> 03:52.858
Damn. Jack.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.693
Jack, come on, man. It's

03:52.900 --> 03:54.693
been a half hour already.

03:56.528 --> 03:57.487
Serg.

03:57.529 --> 03:58.906
What?

03:58.947 --> 04:00.782
Get some money from June

03:58.947 --> 04:00.782
for me before he leaves.

04:00.824 --> 04:02.617
Please. Like 50.

04:02.659 --> 04:03.911
Thanks, baby.

04:05.412 --> 04:06.371
Jackie needs

04:05.412 --> 04:06.371
some bread.

04:07.789 --> 04:09.041
Yeah?

04:09.083 --> 04:10.834
How much?

04:10.876 --> 04:12.127
Half a man.

04:12.169 --> 04:13.837
I just gave her

04:12.169 --> 04:13.837
50 yesterday, yo.

04:13.879 --> 04:15.214
Well, tell her I

04:13.879 --> 04:15.214
said, "Get a job."

04:17.841 --> 04:19.968
DEZ:

04:17.841 --> 04:19.968
Hey, look, let me get

04:17.841 --> 04:19.968
half of that apple, though.

04:20.010 --> 04:22.012
Where your hooping gear?

04:20.010 --> 04:22.012
You know we got practice,

04:20.010 --> 04:22.012
player.

04:22.053 --> 04:24.223
JACKIE: Sergio's best

04:22.053 --> 04:24.223
friends, Sean and Dez,

04:24.264 --> 04:25.891
were always getting

04:24.264 --> 04:25.891
him in trouble.

04:25.933 --> 04:28.476
He knew better, but to

04:25.933 --> 04:28.476
tell you the truth,

04:28.518 --> 04:30.104
he probably would have been

04:28.518 --> 04:30.104
bored without them.

04:30.145 --> 04:32.022
Hey, bro. So, look,

04:30.145 --> 04:32.022
it's a girl in there,

04:32.064 --> 04:34.024
so when she come out, you're

04:32.064 --> 04:34.024
going--you're going run in.

04:34.066 --> 04:36.068
What she look like?

04:36.110 --> 04:38.862
DEZ: Chill with all that. Be

04:36.110 --> 04:38.862
worried about these snacks, bro.

04:36.110 --> 04:38.862
All right.

04:38.904 --> 04:40.948
All right.

04:38.904 --> 04:40.948
Here she come.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.657
Hey, cutie.

04:44.701 --> 04:46.120
No hoes.

04:46.161 --> 04:47.328
All right. Go ahead,

04:46.161 --> 04:47.328
go for it. Go, go, go.

04:47.370 --> 04:48.580
Hold that.

04:50.331 --> 04:51.875
DEZ:

04:50.331 --> 04:51.875
Grab me some

04:50.331 --> 04:51.875
Skittles, dog.

04:55.254 --> 04:59.258
DEZ:

04:55.254 --> 04:59.258
Okay. Got some

04:55.254 --> 04:59.258
barbeque jawn,

04:59.299 --> 05:01.635
some Skittle jawn.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.888
Oh, dang.

05:04.930 --> 05:07.515
(music playing)

05:07.557 --> 05:08.516
MANAGER:

05:07.557 --> 05:08.516
Come on!

05:08.558 --> 05:09.810
Come on!

05:13.981 --> 05:16.650
JACKIE:

05:13.981 --> 05:16.650
Our neighborhood was divided

05:13.981 --> 05:16.650
into two sections,

05:16.691 --> 05:19.945
the hilltop and the bottom,

05:16.691 --> 05:19.945
where we're from.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.780
The kids on the hill always

05:19.987 --> 05:21.780
thought they were better

05:21.822 --> 05:23.490
because they had

05:21.822 --> 05:23.490
a little more money,

05:23.531 --> 05:26.034
but we had all

05:23.531 --> 05:26.034
the same problems,

05:26.076 --> 05:29.788
drugs, crime, and

05:26.076 --> 05:29.788
everything else.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.290
Even though our

05:29.830 --> 05:31.290
neighborhood was divided,

05:31.331 --> 05:33.583
we all attended

05:31.331 --> 05:33.583
the same school.

05:33.625 --> 05:37.378
Overbrook High,

05:33.625 --> 05:37.378
the castle on the hill.

05:37.420 --> 05:40.257
It's located in the center

05:37.420 --> 05:40.257
of all the drama.

05:44.303 --> 05:46.429
We were always beefing.

05:46.471 --> 05:49.850
There was a constant war

05:46.471 --> 05:49.850
between them and us.

05:52.227 --> 05:54.604
My two best friends

05:52.227 --> 05:54.604
were Trina

05:54.646 --> 05:57.607
and my brother June's

05:54.646 --> 05:57.607
girlfriend, Simone.

05:57.649 --> 06:00.777
Simone and June

05:57.649 --> 06:00.777
have a son together.

06:00.819 --> 06:02.196
TRINA: You don't have

06:00.819 --> 06:02.196
to do that.

06:00.819 --> 06:02.196
SIMONE: They'll try you.

06:02.237 --> 06:04.156
TRINA:

06:02.237 --> 06:04.156
They will shoot

06:02.237 --> 06:04.156
all the time.

06:04.198 --> 06:05.699
Hey, Jack, you do

06:04.198 --> 06:05.699
your math homework?

06:05.740 --> 06:06.700
JACKIE: Uh-huh. Why?

06:06.741 --> 06:07.659
Let me see

06:06.741 --> 06:07.659
that jawn.

06:09.744 --> 06:12.039
I'm glad we ain't

06:09.744 --> 06:12.039
got cheerleading

06:09.744 --> 06:12.039
practice today.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.748
I am not in the mood.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.748
TRINA: Oh, that's right.

06:13.790 --> 06:16.126
Girl, you better start doing

06:13.790 --> 06:16.126
your own homework, Trina.

06:16.168 --> 06:17.961
Why? I know you're

06:16.168 --> 06:17.961
gonna do yours.

06:18.003 --> 06:19.504
Ain't that what

06:18.003 --> 06:19.504
friends are for?

06:21.673 --> 06:23.424
Jack, I need

06:21.673 --> 06:23.424
you to babysit

06:21.673 --> 06:23.424
for me tonight.

06:23.466 --> 06:24.885
I'm trying to go

06:23.466 --> 06:24.885
to Peanut' party?

06:24.926 --> 06:26.887
I love my nephew, but

06:24.926 --> 06:26.887
I do not have kids.

06:26.928 --> 06:28.805
Plus, I might be busy.

06:32.351 --> 06:33.518
Yeah, right.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.355
Never mind, I'll

06:33.560 --> 06:36.355
ask your mom.

06:36.395 --> 06:38.481
Oh. Y'all see

06:36.395 --> 06:38.481
Chris' new car?

06:38.523 --> 06:39.691
Who?

06:39.733 --> 06:40.734
Chris.

06:40.775 --> 06:42.569
Girl, that boy is fine.

06:42.610 --> 06:45.280
Last I checked

06:42.610 --> 06:45.280
he was from the

06:42.610 --> 06:45.280
hill, am I right?

06:45.322 --> 06:48.700
So what? I will

06:45.322 --> 06:48.700
break his ass down.

06:51.619 --> 06:54.915
Right? But the dance

06:51.619 --> 06:54.915
is coming up.

06:54.956 --> 06:56.666
I'm thinking, date,

06:54.956 --> 06:56.666
Jack, huh, Moni?

06:56.708 --> 06:58.168
Uh-uh. Nope.

06:58.210 --> 07:00.212
No. Uh-uh. I ain't

06:58.210 --> 07:00.212
co-signing that one.

07:00.254 --> 07:01.546
I ain't thinking

07:00.254 --> 07:01.546
about no dance.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.422
I could care less.

07:03.464 --> 07:05.342
All right. Whatever.

07:03.464 --> 07:05.342
I'm just trying to look

07:03.464 --> 07:05.342
out for a sister.

07:05.384 --> 07:07.677
I'm going to the

07:05.384 --> 07:07.677
library where some

07:05.384 --> 07:07.677
of y'all need to be.

07:07.719 --> 07:09.179
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:07.719 --> 07:09.179
Meet me at my locker

07:07.719 --> 07:09.179
after school.

07:09.221 --> 07:11.390
SIMONE:

07:09.221 --> 07:11.390
Yeah, and call me

07:09.221 --> 07:11.390
if you could babysit.

07:38.292 --> 07:40.668
CHRIS: What you

07:38.292 --> 07:40.668
reading, sis?

07:40.710 --> 07:42.503
You wouldn't

07:40.710 --> 07:42.503
know it.

07:42.545 --> 07:44.756
Well, try me.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.633
Makes Me Wanna Holler.

07:46.674 --> 07:48.635
By Nathan McCall.

07:48.676 --> 07:50.511
You're spending all this

07:48.676 --> 07:50.511
time in the library

07:50.553 --> 07:52.180
and you're still judging

07:50.553 --> 07:52.180
a book by its cover.

07:52.222 --> 07:53.514
I just thought.

07:53.556 --> 07:55.183
CHRIS: What?

07:53.556 --> 07:55.183
That I was lost?

07:55.225 --> 07:56.476
No.

07:56.517 --> 07:59.354
I read it and a few

07:56.517 --> 07:59.354
others like it.

08:00.730 --> 08:02.274
You're June's

08:00.730 --> 08:02.274
sister, right?

08:02.316 --> 08:03.608
Yeah, that's me.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.485
And you and Sergio,

08:03.650 --> 08:05.485
y'all are twins.

08:06.861 --> 08:07.988
Okay.

08:08.029 --> 08:09.072
You did your homework.

08:12.784 --> 08:14.286
You know, I be

08:12.784 --> 08:14.286
seeing you at the game

08:14.328 --> 08:15.703
doing your

08:14.328 --> 08:15.703
cheerleadin' thing.

08:15.745 --> 08:17.956
I always thought

08:15.745 --> 08:17.956
you was cute

08:17.998 --> 08:20.583
but I don't never

08:17.998 --> 08:20.583
see you with no dudes.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.920
You got a boyfriend?

08:23.962 --> 08:25.546
These little boys

08:23.962 --> 08:25.546
right here?

08:25.588 --> 08:27.215
Yeah, right.

08:27.257 --> 08:29.676
Plus, they all act like

08:27.257 --> 08:29.676
they' scared of June.

08:29.717 --> 08:30.677
Shh.

08:38.477 --> 08:40.061
Don't you live somewhere

08:38.477 --> 08:40.061
down the bottom?

08:40.102 --> 08:41.355
Yeah. And?

08:41.395 --> 08:43.398
Not like that, but...

08:43.440 --> 08:46.985
I drive that way

08:43.440 --> 08:46.985
when I go way home.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.153
I'd love to give

08:47.027 --> 08:48.153
you a ride.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.739
I'm asking

08:50.030 --> 08:51.739
if you want.

08:51.781 --> 08:54.159
I'm literally parked

08:51.781 --> 08:54.159
right in front

08:51.781 --> 08:54.159
of the school.

08:55.535 --> 08:58.663
So maybe we

08:55.535 --> 08:58.663
can meet there

08:58.705 --> 09:00.915
and finish

08:58.705 --> 09:00.915
talking?

09:00.957 --> 09:02.542
Yeah? No?

09:04.169 --> 09:05.837
I'll see you later.

09:18.433 --> 09:19.393
Let's go.

09:18.433 --> 09:19.393
Let's go.

("What We Do,"

09:21.478 --> 09:24.105

09:24.147 --> 09:26.441
JACKIE: Serg has always

09:24.147 --> 09:26.441
been special to me.

09:26.483 --> 09:28.360
As divided as our

09:26.483 --> 09:28.360
neighborhood is,

09:28.402 --> 09:31.821
Serg is the only thing that

09:28.402 --> 09:31.821
seems to bring us all together.

09:31.863 --> 09:33.990
("What We Do,"

09:31.863 --> 09:33.990

09:34.032 --> 09:35.658
Yeah, that's what

09:34.032 --> 09:35.658
I'm talking about.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.577
COACH: That's what

09:35.700 --> 09:37.577
I'm talking about.

09:37.618 --> 09:41.873
("What We Do,"

09:37.618 --> 09:41.873
by Freeway, playing)

09:41.915 --> 09:42.832
Yeah!

09:49.797 --> 09:52.259
Man, I'm tired

09:49.797 --> 09:52.259
as hell.

09:52.300 --> 09:53.760
You better

09:52.300 --> 09:53.760
get your rest.

09:53.801 --> 09:56.721
It's going down

09:53.801 --> 09:56.721
tonight, cousin.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.765
Hey, you all going

09:56.763 --> 09:58.765
to Nut' party tonight?

09:58.806 --> 10:01.017
MAN: Hell, yeah.

10:01.059 --> 10:02.477
So what you're

10:01.059 --> 10:02.477
gonna do, Serg?

10:02.519 --> 10:04.104
Yeah, I'm going.

10:02.519 --> 10:04.104
You kidding me, man?

10:04.145 --> 10:07.232
No, man. I mean, like,

10:04.145 --> 10:07.232
after we graduate.

10:10.151 --> 10:13.071
No, I mean, hopefully

10:10.151 --> 10:13.071
go to a D 1 college.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.364
You know, everybody

10:13.113 --> 10:14.364
say I'm good enough,

10:14.406 --> 10:16.116
but you never know

10:14.406 --> 10:16.116
what can happen

10:16.157 --> 10:18.159
between now and

10:16.157 --> 10:18.159
then, you know

10:16.157 --> 10:18.159
what I mean?

10:18.201 --> 10:19.160
Yeah, you right.

10:21.037 --> 10:22.663
Crazy thing

10:21.037 --> 10:22.663
is though, man,

10:22.705 --> 10:25.208
you're gonna get so

10:22.705 --> 10:25.208
much better by then.

10:27.168 --> 10:30.464
I'm thinking about

10:27.168 --> 10:30.464
trying to go to

10:27.168 --> 10:30.464
college too.

10:30.505 --> 10:32.632
That's cool, bro.

10:32.673 --> 10:33.967
And you definitely

10:32.673 --> 10:33.967
could do it.

10:34.008 --> 10:36.219
You think so?

10:34.008 --> 10:36.219
SERGIO: Yeah.

10:36.261 --> 10:38.138
I bet you could

10:36.261 --> 10:38.138
do anything.

10:38.179 --> 10:39.556
But first

10:38.179 --> 10:39.556
things first.

10:39.598 --> 10:41.182
Look, I already

10:39.598 --> 10:41.182
know, man,

10:41.224 --> 10:42.809
we got Bartram

10:41.224 --> 10:42.809
this Friday

10:42.850 --> 10:45.019
and you got to worry

10:42.850 --> 10:45.019
about it.

10:42.850 --> 10:45.019
Uh-uh.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.480
You got Bartram

10:45.061 --> 10:46.480
to worry about.

10:46.521 --> 10:48.356
I don't worry.

10:46.521 --> 10:48.356
I win.

10:48.398 --> 10:50.150
Come on, man. And I

10:48.398 --> 10:50.150
know you heard

10:50.191 --> 10:51.859
about Nate Richards

10:50.191 --> 10:51.859
committin' to Georgetown.

10:51.901 --> 10:53.069
You better step

10:51.901 --> 10:53.069
your game up.

10:53.111 --> 10:54.488
So?

10:54.529 --> 10:57.031
He's 30

10:54.529 --> 10:57.031
and he's

10:54.529 --> 10:57.031
a senior.

10:57.073 --> 10:59.200
It's his third

10:57.073 --> 10:59.200
year as a senior.

10:59.242 --> 11:01.411
All them scouts that's

10:59.242 --> 11:01.411
gonna be there, bro,

11:01.453 --> 11:03.704
I'm getting in my bag,

11:01.453 --> 11:03.704
I'm dropping like

11:01.453 --> 11:03.704
50 on 'em, count it.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.499
"He's 30 years old.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.499
I'm getting in my bag."

11:05.540 --> 11:08.168
Look man, he gonna bust

11:05.540 --> 11:08.168
all of us up and drop 50

11:08.209 --> 11:09.710
if you don't lock him up.

11:09.752 --> 11:10.711
That's all I'm saying.

11:12.713 --> 11:17.594

11:21.764 --> 11:23.600
JACKIE: June has been

11:21.764 --> 11:23.600
best friends with

11:21.764 --> 11:23.600
these two brothers,

11:23.642 --> 11:25.726
Peanut and Bunch

11:23.642 --> 11:25.726
since he was five.

11:25.768 --> 11:28.522
The three of them were

11:25.768 --> 11:28.522
always up to no good.

11:28.563 --> 11:30.190
But June takes care of them

11:30.231 --> 11:32.066
like he takes care

11:30.231 --> 11:32.066
of Serg and me.

11:32.108 --> 11:33.067
Peanut.

11:33.109 --> 11:34.611
Yo.

11:34.653 --> 11:35.903
You get my stash from Ty?

11:35.945 --> 11:37.864
Yeah, yeah.

11:37.905 --> 11:39.533
He said he needs four

11:37.905 --> 11:39.533
a half by tonight.

11:39.574 --> 11:40.783
Word? That's

11:39.574 --> 11:40.783
what he said?

11:40.825 --> 11:43.370
All right.

11:43.411 --> 11:44.745
Yo, is this my CD?

11:44.787 --> 11:46.705
It was.

11:46.747 --> 11:48.542
Shit, you had my Drake

11:46.747 --> 11:48.542

11:48.583 --> 11:49.750
Man, sit down.

11:49.792 --> 11:50.793
Nigga, you drawin'.

11:50.835 --> 11:52.003
Wiz for Drake?

11:52.045 --> 11:53.963
How the fuck

11:52.045 --> 11:53.963

11:54.005 --> 11:55.549
I'm bringing your shit

11:54.005 --> 11:55.549

11:55.590 --> 11:58.051
Yo, you seen that

11:55.590 --> 11:58.051

11:58.092 --> 11:59.718
Hell, yeah,

11:59.760 --> 12:01.429
I'm gonna take

11:59.760 --> 12:01.429

12:01.471 --> 12:03.431
Word. I think it was

12:01.471 --> 12:03.431
the eight cylinder jawn.

12:03.473 --> 12:04.849
That was that

12:03.473 --> 12:04.849
six cylinder.

12:04.891 --> 12:07.185
He just had that

12:04.891 --> 12:07.185
AMG kid on that.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.103
He didn't spend no

12:07.227 --> 12:09.103
60 "Gs" on that.

12:09.145 --> 12:11.022
PEANUT:

12:09.145 --> 12:11.022
I can say if anybody

12:09.145 --> 12:11.022
know, you know, huh?

12:11.064 --> 12:12.691
You know I know.

12:12.731 --> 12:15.276
Say, what's the word

12:12.731 --> 12:15.276
on that homicide

12:12.731 --> 12:15.276
last night?

12:15.318 --> 12:16.903
Same shit.

12:16.944 --> 12:18.905
Niggas on the hill

12:16.944 --> 12:18.905
tripping about it.

12:18.946 --> 12:20.615
Yeah, it's about

12:18.946 --> 12:20.615
to get crazy out here.

12:20.657 --> 12:22.909
You know all they like

12:22.950 --> 12:24.536

12:24.578 --> 12:26.829
No shit. But they can do

12:24.578 --> 12:26.829
it however they wanna do.

12:28.540 --> 12:31.292
Man, I say, we just stay

12:28.540 --> 12:31.292
focus on this cheese.

12:31.334 --> 12:32.835
Everything going

12:32.877 --> 12:34.588
We don't need no dumb

12:34.629 --> 12:36.089
You know what

12:34.629 --> 12:36.089

12:36.130 --> 12:37.131
Yeah, don't worry

12:36.130 --> 12:37.131

12:59.987 --> 13:02.282

12:59.987 --> 13:02.282

Yeah, yeah.

13:30.685 --> 13:33.438
I go to work

13:30.685 --> 13:33.438

anymore, for

13:35.022 --> 13:36.399
real, brother.

13:36.441 --> 13:37.484

19:36.425 --> 19:38.636
money and I'm trying

19:36.425 --> 19:38.636
to do it like that.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.638
Plus, I'm on a fixed

19:38.678 --> 19:40.638
income already, man.

19:40.680 --> 19:41.931
What's that?

19:41.973 --> 19:43.265
It mean I got

19:41.973 --> 19:43.265
to fix it,

19:43.307 --> 19:46.310
so I could get

19:43.307 --> 19:46.310
some income, nigga.

19:46.352 --> 19:48.980
Now, look, man, I ain't

19:46.352 --> 19:48.980
got no hoop dreams

19:49.022 --> 19:51.065
or whatever like

19:49.022 --> 19:51.065
y'all got, all right?

19:51.107 --> 19:52.775
I got to grind for mine.

19:52.817 --> 19:55.402
So I'm doing this shit

19:52.817 --> 19:55.402
with or without y'all.

19:55.444 --> 19:57.655
You know I could use

19:55.444 --> 19:57.655
that extra paper, man.

19:57.697 --> 20:00.616
See, now that's what

19:57.697 --> 20:00.616
I'm talking about.

20:00.658 --> 20:02.660
They leavin'

20:00.658 --> 20:02.660
the same week

20:00.658 --> 20:02.660
as the dance.

20:02.702 --> 20:05.454
So the way I see

20:02.702 --> 20:05.454
it, you know,

20:05.496 --> 20:06.831
we hit it the

20:05.496 --> 20:06.831
same night.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.875
You really think

20:06.873 --> 20:08.875
this could work?

20:08.916 --> 20:11.044
Not only do I think

20:08.916 --> 20:11.044
it could work,

20:11.085 --> 20:13.379
we got the perfect alibi.

20:13.420 --> 20:15.756
The dance.

20:15.798 --> 20:17.424
(telephone rings)

20:20.178 --> 20:21.137
Hello?

20:21.179 --> 20:22.889
Jack, what happened?

20:22.930 --> 20:25.432
Where were you?

20:22.930 --> 20:25.432
I waited for you and

20:22.930 --> 20:25.432
almost missed the bus.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.560
JACKIE: My phone

20:25.474 --> 20:27.560
died. My phone.

20:27.601 --> 20:29.269
You ain't gonna believe

20:27.601 --> 20:29.269
who drove me home.

20:29.311 --> 20:30.730
Jack, I don't care

20:29.311 --> 20:30.730
if Lil Wayne

20:30.771 --> 20:32.398
picked your ass up

20:30.771 --> 20:32.398
and drove you home.

20:32.439 --> 20:34.067
You just--you don't do

20:32.439 --> 20:34.067
that kind of thing.

20:34.108 --> 20:35.068
That boy, Chris.

20:37.444 --> 20:38.696
Chris, who?

20:38.738 --> 20:39.697
Chris, Chris?

20:39.739 --> 20:40.781
Yes.

20:40.823 --> 20:42.950
Oh, shit. How'd

20:40.823 --> 20:42.950
that happen?

20:42.992 --> 20:44.702
I met him in the

20:42.992 --> 20:44.702
library today.

20:44.744 --> 20:45.912
All right. Well, how

20:44.744 --> 20:45.912
the hell did you get

20:45.953 --> 20:47.538
from the library

20:45.953 --> 20:47.538
to your house?

20:47.580 --> 20:49.289
Well, we talked

20:47.580 --> 20:49.289
for a little bit

20:49.331 --> 20:52.919
and he offered me a

20:49.331 --> 20:52.919
ride home from school.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.795
Mm-hmm. You ain't

20:52.960 --> 20:54.795
got to wait until

20:52.960 --> 20:54.795
after school

20:54.837 --> 20:56.005
to let him give

20:54.837 --> 20:56.005
you a ride.

20:56.047 --> 20:57.882
You're so

20:56.047 --> 20:57.882
damn nasty.

20:59.550 --> 21:00.801
He gave me his

20:59.550 --> 21:00.801
number too.

21:00.843 --> 21:02.011
All right. Well,

21:00.843 --> 21:02.011
did you call him?

21:02.053 --> 21:03.012
You think I

21:02.053 --> 21:03.012
should call him?

21:03.054 --> 21:04.013
Jack, after I almost

21:04.055 --> 21:05.056
missed the bus

21:04.055 --> 21:05.056
for y'all,

21:05.098 --> 21:06.265
you better call him.

21:06.306 --> 21:07.266
Well, give me

21:06.306 --> 21:07.266
one good reason

21:07.307 --> 21:08.434
why I should

21:07.307 --> 21:08.434
call him.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.478
Okay. I'll give

21:09.602 --> 21:11.478
you three.

21:11.520 --> 21:14.023
Number one, you

21:11.520 --> 21:14.023
ain't about to

21:11.520 --> 21:14.023
be calling my ass

21:14.065 --> 21:15.566
every half hour

21:14.065 --> 21:15.566
this evening,

21:15.608 --> 21:17.276
talking about some,

21:15.608 --> 21:17.276
"I'm bored."

21:17.317 --> 21:19.445
number two, if you

21:17.317 --> 21:19.445
don't call him,

21:19.486 --> 21:21.488
I'm gonna come

21:19.486 --> 21:21.488
over there and

21:19.486 --> 21:21.488
beat your ass.

21:21.530 --> 21:23.116
Okay, whatever.

21:21.530 --> 21:23.116
TRINA: And number three,

21:23.157 --> 21:24.450
if you don't call him,

21:24.491 --> 21:26.244
I'm coming over and

21:24.491 --> 21:26.244
beating that ass.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.703
As a matter of fact,

21:26.285 --> 21:27.703
I'ma get Bunch

21:27.745 --> 21:29.371
to come over and

21:27.745 --> 21:29.371
beat that ass.

21:27.745 --> 21:29.371
How about that?

21:29.413 --> 21:31.249
TRINA: Yeah, uh-huh.

21:29.413 --> 21:31.249
That's what I thought.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.417
Hang up this

21:31.290 --> 21:33.417
phone right now

21:31.290 --> 21:33.417
and call that boy.

21:33.459 --> 21:34.877
Okay, bye.

21:36.670 --> 21:38.338
(telephone rings)

21:39.840 --> 21:41.134
Hello?

21:41.175 --> 21:42.927
Hey, is Chris there?

21:42.969 --> 21:44.178
Yeah, this is Chris.

21:42.969 --> 21:44.178
Who is this?

21:44.220 --> 21:45.179
Jackie from school.

21:47.347 --> 21:48.933
CHRIS: Hey, what's up?

21:47.347 --> 21:48.933
Hold on one second.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.231
Hello?

21:55.273 --> 21:56.482
You all right?

21:56.523 --> 21:58.525
Yeah, I'm cool.

21:58.567 --> 22:00.111
You decided to call me?

22:00.153 --> 22:01.862
It was the book

22:00.153 --> 22:01.862
thing, you know.

22:01.904 --> 22:04.824
You surprised

22:01.904 --> 22:04.824
me with that.

22:04.865 --> 22:07.743
You know what's

22:04.865 --> 22:07.743
funny? I was actually

22:04.865 --> 22:07.743
reading that book

22:07.785 --> 22:09.369
since you mentioned

22:07.785 --> 22:09.369
it earlier.

22:09.411 --> 22:10.871
JACKIE: Oh, yeah?

22:09.411 --> 22:10.871
Yeah.

22:10.913 --> 22:12.165
I mean, know you

22:10.913 --> 22:12.165
probably thought

22:12.206 --> 22:14.125
I was joking earlier

22:14.167 --> 22:16.376
but I don't know if...

22:14.167 --> 22:16.376
How you wanna do it,

22:14.167 --> 22:16.376
but I can...

22:16.418 --> 22:19.880
I can always...

22:16.418 --> 22:19.880
Wait, are you

22:16.418 --> 22:19.880
allowed company?

22:19.922 --> 22:22.382
Trust me, you don't

22:19.922 --> 22:22.382
wanna do that.

22:22.424 --> 22:23.801
Okay.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.719
I mean, you can always

22:23.843 --> 22:25.719
come to my house.

22:25.761 --> 22:27.680
Your house? Oh,

22:25.761 --> 22:27.680
I don't know.

22:27.721 --> 22:29.015
I don't really know

22:27.721 --> 22:29.015
you like that.

22:29.056 --> 22:30.348
I'm just trying

22:29.056 --> 22:30.348
to help.

22:30.390 --> 22:32.185
I mean, I know

22:30.390 --> 22:32.185
it's the weekend.

22:32.226 --> 22:34.145
You probably going out, right?

22:34.187 --> 22:35.229
I'm not about to pull

22:34.187 --> 22:35.229
your leg about it

22:35.271 --> 22:36.605
but I'm just

22:35.271 --> 22:36.605
saying.

22:36.647 --> 22:38.316
All right.

22:38.356 --> 22:40.901
Look, meet me at the

22:38.356 --> 22:40.901
Sugar Bowl at like, 8:00.

22:40.943 --> 22:42.569
Don't have me

22:40.943 --> 22:42.569
looking stupid.

22:42.611 --> 22:44.947
I couldn't do that

22:42.611 --> 22:44.947
if I tried.

22:44.989 --> 22:46.324
DEZ:

22:44.989 --> 22:46.324
Yeah, yeah. You

22:44.989 --> 22:46.324

22:46.364 --> 22:47.533
SEAN:

22:46.364 --> 22:47.533
Oh, yeah, yeah.

22:46.364 --> 22:47.533
I need that.

22:47.574 --> 22:49.035
Yo.

22:47.574 --> 22:49.035
DEZ: Yeah, no, I got you.

22:49.076 --> 22:50.119
What's up y'all?

22:49.076 --> 22:50.119
Hey, what up, bro?

How many y'all going

22:53.455 --> 22:54.915
You better come

22:53.455 --> 22:54.915

22:54.957 --> 22:56.334
Yeah. You're right,

22:54.957 --> 22:56.334
you're right.

22:56.374 --> 22:57.877
Hold on one second,

22:57.918 --> 22:59.212
No, you good, man.

DEZ: You sure?

22:59.253 --> 23:00.838
Yeah, I'm sure.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.464
All right, bro.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.464
Yup. No problem.

23:02.506 --> 23:03.632
I better see you

23:02.506 --> 23:03.632

23:03.674 --> 23:05.051
I will.

23:03.674 --> 23:05.051
Yeah.

23:05.092 --> 23:07.053
("Real One,"

23:05.092 --> 23:07.053

23:07.094 --> 23:08.929
D.J.: Oh, shit.

23:19.940 --> 23:22.276
("Real One,"

23:19.940 --> 23:22.276

23:31.160 --> 23:32.912
JACKIE:

You live here?

23:32.953 --> 23:35.039
CHRIS: No, we just broke

23:32.953 --> 23:35.039
in somebody' house.

23:35.081 --> 23:36.582
About to go

23:35.081 --> 23:36.582
chill for a minute.

23:36.623 --> 23:37.666
(laughs sarcastically)

23:37.708 --> 23:38.918
Smarty pants.

23:38.959 --> 23:40.961
I'm just saying

23:38.959 --> 23:40.961
it's nice.

23:41.003 --> 23:43.589
Thank you.

23:41.003 --> 23:43.589
Appreciate it.

23:43.630 --> 23:45.591
Where your peoples?

23:45.632 --> 23:47.425
You know, my dad that

but my mom, who tell

23:47.467 --> 23:50.888

You wanna, um, start

23:50.930 --> 23:52.932
on this book report

23:52.973 --> 23:55.184
or listen to

23:52.973 --> 23:55.184
some music?

23:55.226 --> 23:57.644
Oh my--what?

23:55.226 --> 23:57.644
You do know her.

23:57.686 --> 23:59.437
You wasn't lying.

23:57.686 --> 23:59.437
Told you.

23:59.479 --> 24:00.689
I wanna go to the

23:59.479 --> 24:00.689
Philadelphia

24:00.731 --> 24:03.150
Music Academy

24:00.731 --> 24:03.150
when we graduate.

24:03.192 --> 24:04.610
How you start

24:03.192 --> 24:04.610
doing that?

24:04.651 --> 24:06.862
You know, my dad,

24:04.651 --> 24:06.862
he manages groups

24:04.651 --> 24:06.862
and stuff

24:06.904 --> 24:08.614
so that's--well,

24:06.904 --> 24:08.614
that's pretty much it.

24:08.655 --> 24:10.448
You know, I'm around

24:08.655 --> 24:10.448
the studio,

24:10.490 --> 24:13.119
helpin' 'em write

24:10.490 --> 24:13.119
songs, lyrics,

24:13.160 --> 24:15.204
the groups end up

24:13.160 --> 24:15.204
liking 'em.

24:15.246 --> 24:16.789
Hey, and I'm involved.

24:16.830 --> 24:17.790
They pay you?

24:17.831 --> 24:18.958
Do they pay me?

24:18.999 --> 24:20.126
You see my car?

24:21.543 --> 24:23.421
Well, I'm impressed.

24:23.461 --> 24:24.964
You know, I heard

24:23.461 --> 24:24.964

24:25.005 --> 24:27.300
like a really

24:25.005 --> 24:27.300
good singer.

24:27.341 --> 24:28.926
Who told you that?

24:28.968 --> 24:32.138
You know, how you

24:28.968 --> 24:32.138
hear stuff about me?

24:32.179 --> 24:33.555
I hear stuff

24:32.179 --> 24:33.555
about you.

24:35.099 --> 24:36.683
I guess.

24:36.725 --> 24:39.853
That's what I wanna

24:36.725 --> 24:39.853
do and I'm focused.

24:39.895 --> 24:43.023
Well, why don't we

24:39.895 --> 24:43.023
do a collaboration?

24:43.065 --> 24:45.192
Like a Bobby and

24:43.065 --> 24:45.192
Whitney type deal.

24:45.234 --> 24:46.444
Okay, not Bobby

24:45.234 --> 24:46.444
and Whitney

24:46.484 --> 24:47.445
but you know what

24:46.484 --> 24:47.445
I'm talking about.

24:47.485 --> 24:48.446
Something like it.

24:52.241 --> 24:54.743
You know, I heard about

24:52.241 --> 24:54.743
your cousin, Omar,

24:54.785 --> 24:56.662
and I'm real

24:54.785 --> 24:56.662
sorry about that.

24:59.290 --> 25:00.624
Oh, yeah.

25:02.293 --> 25:03.794
Yeah, he was like

25:02.293 --> 25:03.794
my brother.

25:07.547 --> 25:09.175
I'm still trying

25:07.547 --> 25:09.175
to figure how to

25:09.216 --> 25:10.843
get it all together,

25:09.216 --> 25:10.843
you know?

25:15.555 --> 25:17.475
I'll be all

25:15.555 --> 25:17.475
right, though.

25:22.146 --> 25:23.397
Okay.

25:23.439 --> 25:25.941
So where your

25:23.439 --> 25:25.941
girlfriend?

25:25.983 --> 25:27.818
I don't have

25:25.983 --> 25:27.818
a girlfriend.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.527
I was hoping

25:27.860 --> 25:29.527
you would be

25:27.860 --> 25:29.527
interested in that.

25:29.569 --> 25:31.697
With all those girls

25:29.569 --> 25:31.697
that'd be chasing you?

25:31.738 --> 25:33.699
I think I might

25:31.738 --> 25:33.699
save myself

25:31.738 --> 25:33.699
the trouble.

25:33.740 --> 25:35.326
All those girls,

25:33.740 --> 25:35.326
really?

25:35.368 --> 25:36.952
Whoever you're getting

25:35.368 --> 25:36.952
your information from

25:36.994 --> 25:39.621
is really spinning

25:36.994 --> 25:39.621
you in this wrong

25:36.994 --> 25:39.621
direction about me

25:39.663 --> 25:41.874
because it ain't

25:39.663 --> 25:41.874
even like that.

25:41.915 --> 25:44.210
Look, don't get

25:41.915 --> 25:44.210
me wrong.

25:44.251 --> 25:45.711
I think you're

25:44.251 --> 25:45.711
cute or whatever,

25:45.752 --> 25:47.505
but I have plans

25:47.545 --> 25:49.048
and I don't have time

25:47.545 --> 25:49.048
to be sidetracked

25:49.089 --> 25:50.883
by some gaming

25:49.089 --> 25:50.883
ass nigga.

25:50.924 --> 25:52.592
Game?

25:52.634 --> 25:54.094
Jack, I think you're

25:52.634 --> 25:54.094
a really cool chick

25:54.136 --> 25:57.056
but it's like I

25:54.136 --> 25:57.056
see you around

25:57.097 --> 25:59.933
and I'm like I really

25:57.097 --> 25:59.933
wanna get to know

25:57.097 --> 25:59.933
this girl.

25:59.975 --> 26:01.352
I mean, to be honest,

26:01.394 --> 26:03.937
I got a lot of stuff

26:01.394 --> 26:03.937
on my hands as well.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.439
But all this name

26:03.979 --> 26:05.439
calling you're doing,

26:05.481 --> 26:08.192
I really don't think

26:05.481 --> 26:08.192
I deserve all that.

26:08.234 --> 26:11.237
I don't. And I don't

26:08.234 --> 26:11.237
wanna even hold

26:08.234 --> 26:11.237
you up either.

26:13.697 --> 26:15.199
You ready to go?

26:17.201 --> 26:19.370
I thought you was

26:17.201 --> 26:19.370
gonna help me with

26:17.201 --> 26:19.370
my book report.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.419
I was up there

26:24.917 --> 26:26.419
slaying that ass.

26:26.460 --> 26:28.586
I want you all

26:26.460 --> 26:28.586
to call me Conan

26:26.460 --> 26:28.586
from now on.

26:28.628 --> 26:30.047
Oh, this dude

26:28.628 --> 26:30.047
Conan, huh?

26:30.089 --> 26:31.757
Well, Conan, if you

26:30.089 --> 26:31.757
focus on your work

26:31.798 --> 26:33.759
more than you do

26:31.798 --> 26:33.759
these hoes, we'd

26:31.798 --> 26:33.759
all be driving

26:33.800 --> 26:35.052
Bentleys out this

26:33.800 --> 26:35.052
bitch, man.

26:35.094 --> 26:36.678
Man, just because

26:35.094 --> 26:36.678
you on lock down,

26:36.720 --> 26:37.971
don't be

26:36.720 --> 26:37.971
hating on me.

26:38.013 --> 26:40.015
Nigga 22 acting

26:38.013 --> 26:40.015
like he's 35.

26:40.057 --> 26:41.475
(laughing)

26:41.517 --> 26:43.436
Man, You got to realize

26:41.517 --> 26:43.436
what we got, man.

26:43.477 --> 26:45.354
Shit, I'm out here

26:43.477 --> 26:45.354
making sure we eat, man.

26:45.396 --> 26:46.897
While you all motherfuckers

26:45.396 --> 26:46.897
out here running around

26:46.939 --> 26:48.482
and acting like

26:46.939 --> 26:48.482
y'all rich.

26:48.524 --> 26:50.401
Come on, man. Y'all

26:48.524 --> 26:50.401
got to tighten up, man.

26:50.443 --> 26:53.487
These motherfuckers

26:50.443 --> 26:53.487
out here want what

26:50.443 --> 26:53.487
y'all got.

26:53.529 --> 26:55.781
They want what

26:53.529 --> 26:55.781
I got, man.

26:55.822 --> 26:57.157
But they can't

26:55.822 --> 26:57.157
get that shit

26:57.199 --> 26:58.867
and I ain't

26:57.199 --> 26:58.867
gonna let them.

26:58.909 --> 26:59.952
But y'all got

26:58.909 --> 26:59.952
to remember,

26:59.993 --> 27:01.495
shit just got

26:59.993 --> 27:01.495
real, man.

27:01.537 --> 27:02.913
Well, shit, all right.

27:01.537 --> 27:02.913
Keep my blinky on me.

27:02.955 --> 27:04.498
Oh, that's

27:02.955 --> 27:04.498
what you do?

27:04.540 --> 27:06.166
Don't give a fuck, nigga.

27:04.540 --> 27:06.166
Put that shit up.

27:06.208 --> 27:07.418
You'll shoot

27:06.208 --> 27:07.418
your damn self.

27:07.460 --> 27:08.710
MAN: June.

27:08.752 --> 27:10.254
You know that boy

27:08.752 --> 27:10.254
from the center in here?

27:12.172 --> 27:14.174
(music plays)

27:20.431 --> 27:22.015
(music plays)

27:27.813 --> 27:29.315
Hey, nigga, why you

27:27.813 --> 27:29.315
turn the music off?

27:29.356 --> 27:31.108
Nigga, what the fuck?

27:29.356 --> 27:31.108
Nigga, that.

27:31.150 --> 27:32.151
MAN: Talk that now, huh.

27:32.192 --> 27:33.152
June!

27:34.361 --> 27:35.862
MAN: Yeah, talk that now.

27:35.904 --> 27:37.697
Talk that now.

27:37.739 --> 27:38.698
Cut my party?

27:41.368 --> 27:44.288
Well, I hope you

27:41.368 --> 27:44.288
get a good grade

27:44.330 --> 27:46.123
on this book report.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.416
I think that depends

27:46.165 --> 27:47.416
on if you knew

27:47.458 --> 27:50.043
what you was talking

27:47.458 --> 27:50.043
about, right?

27:50.085 --> 27:51.044
I guess so.

27:52.546 --> 27:56.091
So, what are

27:52.546 --> 27:56.091
you, uh...

27:56.133 --> 27:57.759
what are you

27:56.133 --> 27:57.759
doing tomorrow?

27:59.303 --> 28:00.804
Our game is Friday.

28:02.306 --> 28:03.723
Okay. What about

28:02.306 --> 28:03.723
after the game?

28:03.765 --> 28:05.892
You know my brother June

28:03.765 --> 28:05.892
gonna be there, right?

28:05.934 --> 28:07.478
What that mean?

28:11.982 --> 28:15.068
Fuck. I'ma

28:11.982 --> 28:15.068
call you.

28:15.110 --> 28:16.612
Fuck.

28:18.822 --> 28:22.535
(basketball bouncing)

28:22.576 --> 28:24.702
JACKIE: By the time

28:22.576 --> 28:24.702
Friday rolled around,

28:24.744 --> 28:26.872
all I could think

28:24.744 --> 28:26.872
about was Chris.

28:26.913 --> 28:28.706
I figured if Chris

28:26.913 --> 28:28.706
didn't care

28:28.748 --> 28:32.794
what June would think seeing

28:28.748 --> 28:32.794
the two of us together,

28:32.836 --> 28:34.796
let him take the chance.

28:38.217 --> 28:40.427
("Flipside,"

28:38.217 --> 28:40.427
by Freeway, playing)

28:49.353 --> 28:52.022
(crowd chattering)

29:03.783 --> 29:05.661
SIMONE:

29:03.783 --> 29:05.661
You want this?

29:22.094 --> 29:24.096
What's up, sis.

29:24.137 --> 29:25.097
You all right?

29:25.138 --> 29:26.765
What up, man?

29:32.271 --> 29:33.522
What's going on?

29:32.271 --> 29:33.522
How's it going?

29:33.564 --> 29:34.523
JUNE: Real good.

29:35.857 --> 29:36.816
You enjoy the game?

29:36.858 --> 29:37.817
Game was all right.

29:41.238 --> 29:42.615
Serg did his thing.

29:44.324 --> 29:45.659
Y'alls' boy right there.

29:45.701 --> 29:47.453
All right.

29:45.701 --> 29:47.453
Okay.

29:47.494 --> 29:49.580
Let me talk to

29:47.494 --> 29:49.580
you outside for

29:47.494 --> 29:49.580
a second, pal.

29:49.622 --> 29:51.498
Come on.

29:49.622 --> 29:51.498
We'll be right

29:49.622 --> 29:51.498
back, J.

29:51.540 --> 29:53.459
("Flipside,"

29:51.540 --> 29:53.459
by Freeway, playing)

30:00.424 --> 30:01.550
("Flipside,"

30:00.424 --> 30:01.550
by Freeway, playing)

30:05.053 --> 30:07.180
So what you got

30:05.053 --> 30:07.180
on your mind,

30:05.053 --> 30:07.180
young blood?

30:07.222 --> 30:08.641
What you talking

30:07.222 --> 30:08.641
about?

30:08.682 --> 30:10.016
You want me

30:08.682 --> 30:10.016
to spell it out

30:08.682 --> 30:10.016
for you, man?

30:10.058 --> 30:11.268
I heard you came

30:10.058 --> 30:11.268
down to the house

30:10.058 --> 30:11.268
earlier.

30:11.310 --> 30:14.354
Oh, yeah. I drove

30:11.310 --> 30:14.354
Jackie home.

30:14.396 --> 30:15.814
Is that right?

30:14.396 --> 30:15.814
That's it.

30:15.855 --> 30:17.524
Okay. Look, you should

30:15.855 --> 30:17.524
be more careful

30:17.566 --> 30:18.858
coming down

30:17.566 --> 30:18.858
here, you know.

30:18.900 --> 30:19.943
It can get a little

30:18.900 --> 30:19.943
dangerous, man.

30:19.985 --> 30:21.069
You know I'm

30:19.985 --> 30:21.069
a big boy.

30:21.111 --> 30:22.780
I'm just...

30:21.111 --> 30:22.780
I figured

30:22.821 --> 30:24.823
I could handle

30:22.821 --> 30:24.823
anything coming

30:22.821 --> 30:24.823
my way.

30:24.864 --> 30:26.492
Look, I'm just saying.

30:26.533 --> 30:28.452
It's a whole different

30:26.533 --> 30:28.452
vibe going on down here

30:28.494 --> 30:29.869
than what's going

30:28.494 --> 30:29.869
on on the Hill

30:28.494 --> 30:29.869
or whatever.

30:29.911 --> 30:31.955
You feel me?

30:31.997 --> 30:33.499
And I know you know

30:31.997 --> 30:33.499
there's a war

30:33.540 --> 30:35.542
going on right

30:33.540 --> 30:35.542
now between us

30:33.540 --> 30:35.542
and y'all.

30:35.584 --> 30:37.795
Yeah. But, you know,

30:35.584 --> 30:37.795
I don't have nothing

30:35.584 --> 30:37.795
to do with that.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.463
Look here, man,

30:39.505 --> 30:43.133
I'm gonna keep it 100

30:39.505 --> 30:43.133
with you right now, yo.

30:43.175 --> 30:44.510
I'm not really

30:43.175 --> 30:44.510
feeling this

30:43.175 --> 30:44.510
thing you got

30:44.551 --> 30:46.011
going on with my

30:44.551 --> 30:46.011
sister right now.

30:46.052 --> 30:48.013
(indistinct chatter)

30:48.054 --> 30:50.182
I don't know if you

30:48.054 --> 30:50.182
know enough but I

30:48.054 --> 30:50.182
respect you, man.

30:50.223 --> 30:52.184
I'm not trying

30:50.223 --> 30:52.184
to start no

30:50.223 --> 30:52.184
shit with you.

30:53.686 --> 30:55.145
I got three words

30:53.686 --> 30:55.145
for you, okay?

30:57.564 --> 30:59.232
Don't get comfortable.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.611
You got that?

31:19.002 --> 31:20.546
Hey, baby,

31:20.587 --> 31:22.922
I heard about

31:20.587 --> 31:22.922
your game last night.

31:25.551 --> 31:27.511
You're gonna

31:25.551 --> 31:27.511
be a star.

31:29.929 --> 31:31.640
But I knew it

31:29.929 --> 31:31.640
when the doctor

31:31.682 --> 31:32.808
handed you over to me.

31:32.850 --> 31:35.853
I said look at

31:32.850 --> 31:35.853
those long arms,

31:37.604 --> 31:38.772
and I said to myself

31:38.814 --> 31:41.400
I got me a ballplayer

31:41.441 --> 31:43.235
to save this family.

31:46.613 --> 31:48.490
You should have

31:46.613 --> 31:48.490
been there.

31:50.116 --> 31:53.078
I got you some eggs.

31:53.119 --> 31:54.705
Why don't you get

31:53.119 --> 31:54.705
something to eat

31:54.747 --> 31:55.706
before you run

31:54.747 --> 31:55.706
out of here?

31:55.748 --> 31:57.499
I'm late.

31:57.541 --> 31:58.751
Gotta be at the shop

31:58.792 --> 32:00.460
so I'm gonna

31:58.792 --> 32:00.460
just eat this.

32:00.502 --> 32:03.129
Well, get some money

32:00.502 --> 32:03.129
from you brother.

32:07.008 --> 32:08.552
Tell your uncle

32:07.008 --> 32:08.552
I said hi.

32:08.594 --> 32:10.095
SERGIO: All right.

32:12.180 --> 32:13.432
MAN: Look man,

32:12.180 --> 32:13.432
all I'm trying to say

32:13.473 --> 32:15.225
is everything ain't that easy.

32:15.267 --> 32:18.061
You can't control

32:15.267 --> 32:18.061
everything in your

32:15.267 --> 32:18.061
life, Ron.

32:18.103 --> 32:21.690
Things come at

32:18.103 --> 32:21.690
you sometimes

32:18.103 --> 32:21.690
unexpectedly.

32:21.732 --> 32:23.942
UNCLE RON:That's true

32:21.732 --> 32:23.942
but you can control

32:23.983 --> 32:25.569
how you handle

32:23.983 --> 32:25.569
the situation.

32:25.611 --> 32:28.071
You ain't got

32:25.611 --> 32:28.071
to be no fool.

32:28.113 --> 32:29.406
You ain't gonna

32:28.113 --> 32:29.406
go ahead

32:29.448 --> 32:30.699
with your head

32:29.448 --> 32:30.699
all cut off

32:30.741 --> 32:31.867
and hollering

32:30.741 --> 32:31.867
at people.

32:31.909 --> 32:33.869
You can control

32:31.909 --> 32:33.869
that, huh?

32:33.911 --> 32:35.662
That's easier said

32:33.911 --> 32:35.662
than done, Ronny.

32:35.704 --> 32:36.914
Oh, man.

32:35.704 --> 32:36.914
Come on.

32:36.955 --> 32:38.874
Oh, hey, hey,

32:36.955 --> 32:38.874
hey, hey.

32:38.916 --> 32:39.875
I got no change.

32:39.917 --> 32:41.293
That's you, man.

32:41.334 --> 32:42.836
All right? I'll see

32:41.334 --> 32:42.836
you next week.

32:42.878 --> 32:44.045
All right,

32:42.878 --> 32:44.045
black man. Okay.

32:44.087 --> 32:45.380
Thanks, man.

32:45.422 --> 32:47.048
All right.

32:47.090 --> 32:48.049
Serg.

32:47.090 --> 32:48.049
SERGIO: Man.

32:48.091 --> 32:49.843
What up, young bull?

32:49.885 --> 32:50.844
You do your thing, man.

32:50.886 --> 32:52.053
I appreciate it.

32:52.095 --> 32:53.639
You stay safe, love it.

32:52.095 --> 32:53.639
Yes, sir.

32:53.680 --> 32:55.891
UNCLE RON:

32:53.680 --> 32:55.891
Look what the

32:53.680 --> 32:55.891
wind blow in.

32:55.933 --> 32:57.810
Look what the

32:55.933 --> 32:57.810
wind blow in.

32:57.851 --> 32:59.478
(laughing)

32:59.519 --> 33:00.854
Man, what are you--

32:59.519 --> 33:00.854
throw it up, man.

33:00.896 --> 33:01.980
What's up?

33:00.896 --> 33:01.980
What's up Uncle Ron?

33:02.021 --> 33:03.022
What's up, man?

33:03.064 --> 33:04.232
Ah, look at that hair.

33:04.274 --> 33:05.275
Look at that hair

33:04.274 --> 33:05.275
blowing up.

33:05.317 --> 33:06.318
What are--your

33:05.317 --> 33:06.318
floating

33:06.359 --> 33:07.486
this mother

33:06.359 --> 33:07.486
fucker.

33:07.527 --> 33:09.362
I know you saw

33:07.527 --> 33:09.362
me last night.

33:09.404 --> 33:11.824
Ain't gonna miss no game,

33:09.404 --> 33:11.824
no, you know that.

33:11.865 --> 33:14.326
Your daddy'd be

33:11.865 --> 33:14.326
proud of you,

33:11.865 --> 33:14.326
you know that.

33:14.367 --> 33:15.828
I know.

33:14.367 --> 33:15.828
I wish he coulda seen that game.

33:15.869 --> 33:17.162
Boy, that was gold can.

33:17.203 --> 33:18.455
Yes, sir, I know.

33:18.497 --> 33:19.665
I ain't seen you

33:18.497 --> 33:19.665
in a while, man.

33:19.706 --> 33:20.958
You know, where were

33:19.706 --> 33:20.958
you? Are you busy?

33:20.999 --> 33:23.168
No. It's just school

33:23.209 --> 33:24.670
and then

33:23.209 --> 33:24.670
basketball practice

33:24.711 --> 33:26.171
and then school

33:26.212 --> 33:28.089
and then basketball

33:26.212 --> 33:28.089
practice. I'm just busy.

33:28.131 --> 33:30.008
You know how it it's

33:28.131 --> 33:30.008
like when you

33:28.131 --> 33:30.008
young, Uncle Ron.

33:30.049 --> 33:31.426
That's what I'm trying

33:30.049 --> 33:31.426
to tell you.

33:31.468 --> 33:33.345
See, the foundation

33:31.468 --> 33:33.345
you're making right now

33:33.386 --> 33:36.222
is for who you gonna

33:33.386 --> 33:36.222
be in the future.

33:36.264 --> 33:38.016
So when you walk down

33:36.264 --> 33:38.016
these streets in Philly,

33:38.057 --> 33:40.853
they go, "There he go,

33:38.057 --> 33:40.853
there goes Sergio."

33:40.894 --> 33:43.188
Went to college, pro ball,

33:43.229 --> 33:44.982
bought his uncle

33:43.229 --> 33:44.982
a Rolls-Royce.

33:45.064 --> 33:46.525
(laughs)

33:46.566 --> 33:48.193
I done walked

33:46.566 --> 33:48.193
by a college

33:46.566 --> 33:48.193
or two, now.

33:48.234 --> 33:49.569
(laughs)

33:49.611 --> 33:50.779
I get it. And I

33:49.611 --> 33:50.779
appreciate the fact

33:50.821 --> 33:52.447
that you concerned,

33:50.821 --> 33:52.447
you know,

33:52.489 --> 33:54.533
but we got this, like me

33:52.489 --> 33:54.533
and June got a plan.

33:54.574 --> 33:56.409
We got a map and

33:54.574 --> 33:56.409
it's working.

33:56.451 --> 33:57.452
Is it not working?

33:57.494 --> 33:59.538
I understand all of that.

33:59.579 --> 34:02.749
I done seen this hood

33:59.579 --> 34:02.749
take down the best.

34:02.791 --> 34:04.376
Hmm?

34:04.417 --> 34:06.003
Bucky,

34:06.044 --> 34:08.714
or Pretty Tone...

34:08.755 --> 34:11.216
Frog, huh?

34:11.257 --> 34:12.509
Will Smith.

34:12.551 --> 34:14.887
And Will Smith went

34:12.551 --> 34:14.887
to Overbrook.

34:14.928 --> 34:17.263
And he stayed focused.

34:17.304 --> 34:18.431
You see what I'm saying?

34:20.016 --> 34:22.561
The hood ain't nothing

34:20.016 --> 34:22.561
but a breeding ground

34:22.601 --> 34:24.353
for young

34:22.601 --> 34:24.353
black talent.

34:24.396 --> 34:25.688
There's talent

34:24.396 --> 34:25.688
everywhere.

34:25.731 --> 34:27.273
There's a Michael Jordan

34:25.731 --> 34:27.273
down the street.

34:27.315 --> 34:29.860
There's a Mike Tyson

34:27.315 --> 34:29.860
over here.

34:29.902 --> 34:31.652
There's a Biggie Smalls

34:31.695 --> 34:33.321
working at (indistinct).

34:33.362 --> 34:36.783
But the hood has

34:33.362 --> 34:36.783
a way of knocking

34:33.362 --> 34:36.783
you off your square.

34:36.824 --> 34:41.746
See, the hood got

34:36.824 --> 34:41.746
a way of catering

34:36.824 --> 34:41.746
to your wants.

34:41.788 --> 34:43.415
Just like your brother,

34:41.788 --> 34:43.415
for instance.

34:43.456 --> 34:46.125
Your brother can be

34:43.456 --> 34:46.125
anything he wanna be,

34:46.167 --> 34:48.335
what he wanted,

34:46.167 --> 34:48.335
he gonna go get it.

34:48.378 --> 34:52.215
Not the right way

34:48.378 --> 34:52.215
by earning it, he

34:48.378 --> 34:52.215
gonna take it, huh?

34:52.257 --> 34:53.884
Just like his daddy.

34:53.926 --> 34:55.092
You can stop me

34:53.926 --> 34:55.092
when I'm lying.

34:55.134 --> 34:56.428
Are you gonna stop

34:55.134 --> 34:56.428
when I'm lying?

34:56.469 --> 34:57.763
But I'm not

34:56.469 --> 34:57.763
that naive

34:57.804 --> 34:59.222
and I'm doing

34:57.804 --> 34:59.222
what I got to do.

34:59.264 --> 35:01.850
I understand that.

34:59.264 --> 35:01.850
That's why I'm talking.

35:01.892 --> 35:05.144
I don't talk to these

35:01.892 --> 35:05.144
niggas, I don't talk

35:01.892 --> 35:05.144
to your brother like this.

35:05.186 --> 35:07.898
Your character is gonna

35:05.186 --> 35:07.898
determine your fate,

35:07.940 --> 35:09.733
not your talent.

35:17.657 --> 35:19.367
("Throw it in the Bag,"

35:17.657 --> 35:19.367
by Fabulous, playing)

35:19.409 --> 35:21.870
JACKIE: June thought

35:19.409 --> 35:21.870
Saturday was like Christmas.

35:21.912 --> 35:23.956
He always said,

35:23.997 --> 35:26.332
"What's the sense of money

35:23.997 --> 35:26.332
if you're not gonna use it?"

35:26.374 --> 35:29.669
He loved seeing

35:26.374 --> 35:29.669
everyone happy,

35:29.711 --> 35:32.672
especially if he was

35:29.711 --> 35:32.672
the one making them happy.

35:32.714 --> 35:34.215
He wanted to make sure

35:32.714 --> 35:34.215
we all had everything

35:34.257 --> 35:36.384
we need and more.

35:38.011 --> 35:40.013
He thought of his crew

35:38.011 --> 35:40.013
as his brothers.

35:40.055 --> 35:43.683
And he wanted for his brothers

35:40.055 --> 35:43.683
what he wanted for himself,

35:43.725 --> 35:45.310
to live good.

35:52.818 --> 35:54.653

35:56.279 --> 35:57.405
I don't know. You just

35:56.279 --> 35:57.405
don't seem like

35:57.447 --> 35:58.949
the boyfriend

35:57.447 --> 35:58.949
type to me.

35:58.991 --> 36:00.867
You really think I'm

35:58.991 --> 36:00.867
this player type?

36:00.909 --> 36:02.410
Can we hang out

36:00.909 --> 36:02.410
for a little bit?

36:02.452 --> 36:03.495
I wanna take you somewhere.

36:03.536 --> 36:05.163
I really should

36:03.536 --> 36:05.163
stay in.

36:05.204 --> 36:06.915
Things are getting

36:05.204 --> 36:06.915
a little crazy out here.

36:06.957 --> 36:10.043
But you'll be safe

36:06.957 --> 36:10.043
with me, I promise.

36:10.085 --> 36:11.962
I got to get

36:10.085 --> 36:11.962
dressed, though.

36:12.004 --> 36:13.046
All right.

36:13.088 --> 36:14.297
I got to go ahead downtown,

36:14.339 --> 36:16.466
so how about

36:14.339 --> 36:16.466
you meet me

36:16.508 --> 36:18.217
at the store

36:16.508 --> 36:18.217
by the theater?

36:18.259 --> 36:19.344
Why over there?

36:19.385 --> 36:20.428
Can you just

36:19.385 --> 36:20.428
meet me there?

36:22.722 --> 36:24.223
What time?

36:24.265 --> 36:25.475
JUNE: I run

36:24.265 --> 36:25.475
these streets, boy.

36:25.517 --> 36:26.685
Look at you.

36:25.517 --> 36:26.685
Look at you.

36:26.726 --> 36:27.894
JUNE:

36:26.726 --> 36:27.894
Who do you think

36:26.726 --> 36:27.894
taught you?

36:27.936 --> 36:29.270
JUNE:

36:27.936 --> 36:29.270
Check this out.

36:29.312 --> 36:30.814
JUNE: Oh!

36:30.856 --> 36:32.565
SERGIO:

36:30.856 --> 36:32.565
All right. But

36:30.856 --> 36:32.565
you still slow.

36:32.607 --> 36:34.192
Look, you're too small.

36:32.607 --> 36:34.192
Get back, Serg.

36:34.233 --> 36:36.153
Get out of here, boy.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.696
Look at that

36:36.194 --> 36:37.696
three, boy.

36:37.737 --> 36:39.197
You too old.

36:39.238 --> 36:40.740
Oh, I'm going

36:39.238 --> 36:40.740
to Baja!

36:43.535 --> 36:45.120
JUNE: You got lucky, yo.

36:45.162 --> 36:46.371
SERGIO: I didn't

36:45.162 --> 36:46.371
get lucky, you drawin'.

36:46.412 --> 36:47.998
You got lucky.

36:48.040 --> 36:49.582
Come on, stop it.

36:48.040 --> 36:49.582
What? You drawin'!

36:49.624 --> 36:52.044
Whatever, man. I taught

36:49.624 --> 36:52.044
you well, baby boy.

36:52.085 --> 36:55.714
Look you can go as

36:52.085 --> 36:55.714
far as you want

36:52.085 --> 36:55.714
with this, Serg.

36:55.755 --> 36:57.674
You really

36:55.755 --> 36:57.674
think so, though?

36:57.716 --> 37:00.177
It just feels like

36:57.716 --> 37:00.177
a dream sometimes.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.179
Shit, nigga

37:00.218 --> 37:02.179
this is a dream

37:02.220 --> 37:03.596
and you living

Where?

40:27.926 --> 40:29.344
It's a surprise.

40:29.386 --> 40:31.263
What surprise?

40:31.304 --> 40:34.974
Ain't that why they

40:31.304 --> 40:34.974

40:35.016 --> 40:36.726
Yeah, whatever.

40:45.402 --> 40:46.778
JACKIE: What is this place?

40:46.819 --> 40:48.405

your eyes close,

40:49.739 --> 40:52.325

Keep going.

40:55.453 --> 40:56.913
Chris.

40:56.955 --> 40:58.748
Keep walking, keep walking.

40:56.955 --> 40:58.748
We're almost there.

41:01.209 --> 41:02.585
Okay. Now open.

41:05.338 --> 41:07.966
What are we

41:05.338 --> 41:07.966

41:08.007 --> 41:10.551
I got you

41:16.682 --> 41:18.601
Wrote you a song.

41:26.318 --> 41:27.860
Yo, Paul, you

41:27.902 --> 41:30.280
Yeah, I'm ready when

41:27.902 --> 41:30.280
you are Chris.

41:27.902 --> 41:30.280
All right.

41:32.865 --> 41:34.659
You all right?

41:32.865 --> 41:34.659
All right.

41:34.700 --> 41:36.328
Paul, this is my

41:34.700 --> 41:36.328
girl, Jackie.

41:36.369 --> 41:37.370
Jackie,

41:36.369 --> 41:37.370
this is Paul.

41:37.412 --> 41:39.164
Hey nice to meet you.

41:37.412 --> 41:39.164
Hi.

41:39.205 --> 41:41.749
He's gonna be the engineer

41:39.205 --> 41:41.749
for the night, all right?

41:41.791 --> 41:43.793
I can't

41:41.791 --> 41:43.793
believe this.

41:43.835 --> 41:45.795
Look, we're just

41:43.835 --> 41:45.795
gonna practice

41:43.835 --> 41:45.795
these lyrics,

41:45.837 --> 41:47.088
it's gonna be easy,

41:47.130 --> 41:48.881
you gonna knock

41:47.130 --> 41:48.881
this out, all right?

41:50.508 --> 41:52.969
(music playing)

42:08.109 --> 42:13.031
Oh, love is the song we sing

42:13.072 --> 42:15.533
It's all love

42:15.574 --> 42:18.536
Till we failed

42:15.574 --> 42:18.536
and lost the key

42:18.577 --> 42:21.039
Oh, love

42:21.080 --> 42:22.748
Such a game

42:22.790 --> 42:26.002
Where I have no luck

42:26.044 --> 42:29.005
No luck

42:29.047 --> 42:31.549
It was so perfect yesterday

42:31.590 --> 42:34.093
Out of the blue

42:31.590 --> 42:34.093
you walked away

42:34.135 --> 42:37.972
The story I keep

42:34.135 --> 42:37.972
living over again

42:38.014 --> 42:40.016
I pray

42:40.058 --> 42:44.562
Having love would

42:40.058 --> 42:44.562
be all we need

42:44.603 --> 42:47.065
But it's not true, no

42:47.106 --> 42:49.608
Never true, no

42:49.650 --> 42:55.031
So I don't want no love

42:55.073 --> 42:57.575
Gettin' my heart

42:55.073 --> 42:57.575
wrapped up so tight

42:57.616 --> 43:00.203
Then crash to the ground

42:57.616 --> 43:00.203
from way up high

43:00.245 --> 43:04.707
I don't want no love

43:04.749 --> 43:06.501
You fall in love

43:06.543 --> 43:08.169
It's not our fate

43:08.211 --> 43:13.258
'Cause whatever

43:08.211 --> 43:13.258
falls break

43:13.299 --> 43:14.426
Ooh, love

43:14.467 --> 43:17.011
Baby, you sound

43:14.467 --> 43:17.011
so good.

43:17.053 --> 43:19.180
You really think so?

43:17.053 --> 43:19.180
What?

43:19.222 --> 43:20.515
Paul, how'd

43:19.222 --> 43:20.515
she sound?

43:20.557 --> 43:21.558
You sound phenomenal.

43:21.599 --> 43:22.559
It's not even

43:21.599 --> 43:22.559
mixed yet.

43:22.600 --> 43:24.310
It's gonna be great.

43:24.352 --> 43:26.354
I'm telling you.

43:24.352 --> 43:26.354
Paul, let me get

43:24.352 --> 43:26.354
a little bit,

43:26.396 --> 43:27.480
I just want to

43:26.396 --> 43:27.480
talk to her.

43:27.522 --> 43:28.898
Sure. I'll be

43:27.522 --> 43:28.898
the lounge.

43:35.821 --> 43:39.117
Honestly, you

43:35.821 --> 43:39.117
like it?

43:39.158 --> 43:40.618
I guess so.

43:40.659 --> 43:42.454
What do you think?

43:42.495 --> 43:44.663
I mean, your voice

43:44.705 --> 43:47.917
just riding over that

43:44.705 --> 43:47.917
beat was perfect.

43:47.959 --> 43:48.918
You sound amazing.

43:50.836 --> 43:54.632
No one's ever done

43:50.836 --> 43:54.632
anything like this

43:50.836 --> 43:54.632
for me before.

43:54.673 --> 43:56.259
You really

43:54.673 --> 43:56.259
believe in me.

43:58.303 --> 44:01.598
You know, that's

43:58.303 --> 44:01.598
not my voice over

43:58.303 --> 44:01.598
that track,

44:01.639 --> 44:04.809
it's yours because

44:01.639 --> 44:04.809
you're pure talent,

44:01.639 --> 44:04.809
I'm telling you.

44:04.850 --> 44:06.644
This is what

44:04.850 --> 44:06.644
you're supposed

44:04.850 --> 44:06.644
to be doing, Jack.

44:06.685 --> 44:10.523
Yeah, but this ain't

44:06.685 --> 44:10.523
my studio and that's

44:06.685 --> 44:10.523
not my song.

44:10.565 --> 44:13.401
Don't look at

44:10.565 --> 44:13.401
it like that

44:13.443 --> 44:15.153
because I'm gonna

44:13.443 --> 44:15.153
do whatever I can

44:13.443 --> 44:15.153
whenever I can

44:15.194 --> 44:16.904
to help you

44:15.194 --> 44:16.904
out, okay?

44:20.950 --> 44:23.244
So what do

44:20.950 --> 44:23.244
we do now?

44:23.286 --> 44:24.996
I'm gonna get

44:23.286 --> 44:24.996
it mixed,

44:25.037 --> 44:27.206
You gonna put it

44:25.037 --> 44:27.206
out, keep it pushing.

44:27.248 --> 44:29.750
You gotta start

44:27.248 --> 44:29.750
living your dream

44:27.248 --> 44:29.750
someday, right?

44:33.630 --> 44:35.006
I wanna tell

44:33.630 --> 44:35.006
you something.

44:35.047 --> 44:36.633
What?

44:38.593 --> 44:40.094
Never mind.

44:41.513 --> 44:43.515
Tell me.

44:41.513 --> 44:43.515
No.

44:43.556 --> 44:45.308
Please?

44:48.894 --> 44:51.022

44:51.063 --> 44:53.358

I care about

44:55.276 --> 44:57.069

45:19.800 --> 45:21.844

45:19.800 --> 45:21.844

45:27.099 --> 45:29.477
(music playing)

45:36.568 --> 45:39.028
MAN: Fucking Jack,

45:36.568 --> 45:39.028
Little Jack right there.

45:39.070 --> 45:40.446
JACKIE:

45:39.070 --> 45:40.446
What's wrong?

45:40.488 --> 45:42.365
What's wrong? What

45:40.488 --> 45:42.365
happened to you?

45:42.407 --> 45:43.824
JUNE: Some guy

45:42.407 --> 45:43.824
robbed the house.

45:43.866 --> 45:45.702
Mom got shot, Jack.

45:43.866 --> 45:45.702
What? Where is she?

45:45.742 --> 45:47.537
JUNE: She on the way

45:45.742 --> 45:47.537
to the hospital.

45:47.579 --> 45:48.913
It's gonna be all

You're dropping off

45:55.503 --> 45:56.837

45:56.879 --> 45:58.297
He took me to the

45:56.879 --> 45:58.297

45:58.339 --> 45:59.632
I don't give a fuck

45:58.339 --> 45:59.632

45:59.674 --> 46:01.467
Yow, June, relax, man.

46:07.432 --> 46:08.849
MAN:

46:08.891 --> 46:10.351
JACKIE: You need to

46:08.891 --> 46:10.351

46:10.393 --> 46:12.019
Please.

46:10.393 --> 46:12.019
JUNE: You think he's cute. Huh?

46:12.061 --> 46:13.354
This shit is over.

46:12.061 --> 46:13.354
This ain't no game.

46:13.396 --> 46:14.564
Take your fucking

46:13.396 --> 46:14.564

46:14.606 --> 46:15.940
But June.

46:14.606 --> 46:15.940
Look, I don't care.

46:15.981 --> 46:17.900
Whatever y'all had

46:15.981 --> 46:17.900

46:17.942 --> 46:20.612
I ain't playing

46:17.942 --> 46:20.612

46:17.942 --> 46:20.612

46:24.990 --> 46:27.410
What's going on?

46:24.990 --> 46:27.410
Oh, shit.

46:27.452 --> 46:29.828
Oh, hold on,

46:36.001 --> 46:37.962
Slow down, man, slow down.

No, you're bullshitting

46:39.838 --> 46:41.840

46:46.304 --> 46:48.097
Who did it?

46:50.516 --> 46:52.059
All right, bro.

46:53.352 --> 46:54.520
June, what's up?

46:56.230 --> 46:57.732
Let me see your gun, man.

46:57.774 --> 47:00.859
Shit, for real?

46:57.774 --> 47:00.859
All right, what we doin'?

47:00.901 --> 47:02.779
Give me the gun now.

47:02.819 --> 47:04.697
Now, give me the gun.

47:13.539 --> 47:15.792
It's your brother, man.

47:20.296 --> 47:22.465
They killed your

47:20.296 --> 47:22.465

47:25.468 --> 47:27.470
Killed my fucking

47:25.468 --> 47:27.470

47:48.741 --> 47:51.744
JUNE: No, man.

47:48.741 --> 47:51.744

47:51.786 --> 47:53.412

47:51.786 --> 47:53.412

47:56.207 --> 47:59.293
Fuck, fuck, fuck, man!

48:03.047 --> 48:06.008
(music playing)

48:55.558 --> 48:56.768
Where are you going?

48:55.558 --> 48:56.768
Sit down, Serg.

48:56.809 --> 48:59.978
I gotta talk to you.

48:56.809 --> 48:59.978
Sit down. Sit down.

49:00.020 --> 49:01.606
I need to talk to y'all

49:00.020 --> 49:01.606
about a few things.

49:01.647 --> 49:03.608
Now, look, I don't no extra

49:01.647 --> 49:03.608
shit going on around here,

49:03.649 --> 49:05.401
I want y'all to stick

49:03.649 --> 49:05.401
by the house for a

49:03.649 --> 49:05.401
little bit, all right?

49:05.443 --> 49:07.278
What you mean?

49:05.443 --> 49:07.278
What you mean what I mean?

49:07.319 --> 49:08.529
I want you all to stick around

49:07.319 --> 49:08.529
the house for a little while.

49:08.571 --> 49:10.406
I know what I'm

49:08.571 --> 49:10.406
talking about, Jack.

49:10.448 --> 49:12.032
But what about practice?

49:10.448 --> 49:12.032
I can't miss that

49:10.448 --> 49:12.032
because of this.

49:12.074 --> 49:13.785
I got you. I'm gonna

49:12.074 --> 49:13.785
take you to practice

49:13.826 --> 49:14.827
and I'm gonna pick you up.

49:14.869 --> 49:16.621
All right.

49:14.869 --> 49:16.621
Two things,

49:16.662 --> 49:18.664
money's tight

49:16.662 --> 49:18.664
around here

49:18.706 --> 49:20.082
so we can't be doing

49:18.706 --> 49:20.082
this extra spending,

49:20.124 --> 49:21.417
look, not on everything.

49:21.459 --> 49:22.585
Why? Because

49:21.459 --> 49:22.585
of this war?

49:22.627 --> 49:23.878
Look, it's not

49:22.627 --> 49:23.878
because of that.

49:23.920 --> 49:25.671
We just gotta let stuff

49:23.920 --> 49:25.671
simmer down, okay?

49:25.713 --> 49:27.673
I got to get my

49:25.713 --> 49:27.673
money back up, Serg.

49:27.715 --> 49:29.300
I can get a job

49:27.715 --> 49:29.300
after school if

49:27.715 --> 49:29.300
that's the case, bro.

49:29.341 --> 49:31.009
No, you can't get

49:29.341 --> 49:31.009
a job after school.

49:31.051 --> 49:32.303
I want you

49:31.051 --> 49:32.303
to concentrate,

49:32.344 --> 49:34.472
focus on what I

49:32.344 --> 49:34.472
told you, basketball.

49:34.513 --> 49:38.350
And last, I don't want

49:34.513 --> 49:38.350
all them people

49:34.513 --> 49:38.350
in my house, Jackie.

49:38.392 --> 49:40.144
That means Chris,

49:38.392 --> 49:40.144
too, yes.

49:40.185 --> 49:42.979
JACKIE:

49:40.185 --> 49:42.979
Look. I'm usually down

49:40.185 --> 49:42.979
to take your advice,

49:43.021 --> 49:44.607
but I feel like you're

49:43.021 --> 49:44.607
going a bit overboard.

49:44.649 --> 49:46.859
I mean, I don't feel

49:44.649 --> 49:46.859
like hearing none of this.

49:46.901 --> 49:48.319
The Brook Ball

49:46.901 --> 49:48.319
is coming up soon.

49:48.360 --> 49:49.737
That nigga is

49:48.360 --> 49:49.737
from the hill

49:49.779 --> 49:50.987
and you know how

49:49.779 --> 49:50.987
it get down.

49:51.029 --> 49:52.406
I don't want to

49:51.029 --> 49:52.406
even play that shit.

49:52.448 --> 49:54.325
You can't blame your

49:52.448 --> 49:54.325
issues on somebody else.

49:54.366 --> 49:56.076
Oh, my issues.

49:56.118 --> 49:59.079
We got to hold

49:56.118 --> 49:59.079
it down, okay?

49:59.121 --> 50:00.997
I'm taking care of shit

49:59.121 --> 50:00.997
around the house right now.

50:01.039 --> 50:02.750
Serg.

50:02.792 --> 50:03.876
All right now, y'all

50:02.792 --> 50:03.876
got to listen to me.

50:03.918 --> 50:05.085
I know what

50:03.918 --> 50:05.085
I'm saying, Jack.

50:05.127 --> 50:06.504
Look, Serg and

50:05.127 --> 50:06.504
I ain't got

50:06.545 --> 50:08.213
nothing to do with

50:06.545 --> 50:08.213
what's going on.

50:08.255 --> 50:09.966
You can't stop our life

50:08.255 --> 50:09.966
because of your problems.

50:10.006 --> 50:12.468
Look, I'm not gonna

50:10.006 --> 50:12.468
argue with you,

50:10.006 --> 50:12.468
Jackie, okay?

50:12.510 --> 50:13.469
You heard

50:12.510 --> 50:13.469
what I said.

50:13.511 --> 50:14.553
You heard

50:13.511 --> 50:14.553
what I said.

50:14.595 --> 50:15.721
You're not

50:14.595 --> 50:15.721
my father.

50:15.763 --> 50:17.682
Oh, I'm not your father,

50:17.723 --> 50:18.850
but I can buy

50:17.723 --> 50:18.850
you everything

50:18.891 --> 50:20.893
like I am your father

50:18.891 --> 50:20.893
though, right?

50:20.935 --> 50:23.187
Let me tell you

50:20.935 --> 50:23.187
something, girl,

50:23.228 --> 50:25.314
as long as I keep

50:23.228 --> 50:25.314
the lights on up

50:23.228 --> 50:25.314
in this motherfucker,

50:25.356 --> 50:26.649
I am your

50:25.356 --> 50:26.649
father.

50:26.691 --> 50:28.400
I don't need

50:26.691 --> 50:28.400
your money.

50:28.442 --> 50:29.986
Come on, Jack.

50:28.442 --> 50:29.986
Jack, get back here.

50:30.026 --> 50:31.612
June.

50:30.026 --> 50:31.612
Jack, get in here.

50:33.739 --> 50:36.784
DEZ: Hey, look, man,

50:33.739 --> 50:36.784
I heard about what

50:33.739 --> 50:36.784
happened with your moms.

50:36.826 --> 50:38.243
Is she all right?

50:41.706 --> 50:44.667
She'll recover

50:41.706 --> 50:44.667
in a few weeks,

50:44.709 --> 50:46.878
so the doctor said

50:46.919 --> 50:48.337
we got to wait

50:46.919 --> 50:48.337
this whole shit out.

50:50.756 --> 50:53.676
You know, they, um,

50:50.756 --> 50:53.676
they cleaned June out.

50:56.679 --> 51:00.056
They took a lot

50:56.679 --> 51:00.056
of bread, bro.

51:00.098 --> 51:02.100
See, this thing we got

51:00.098 --> 51:02.100
couldn't have came

51:02.142 --> 51:03.602
at a more

51:02.142 --> 51:03.602
perfect time.

51:03.644 --> 51:05.103
I mean, shit, man,

51:05.145 --> 51:07.314
maybe it could be you

51:05.145 --> 51:07.314
helping out for once.

51:09.942 --> 51:12.904
Look, bro, I'm

51:09.942 --> 51:12.904
just trying to look

51:09.942 --> 51:12.904
out for you, man.

51:12.945 --> 51:14.739
Think about it,

51:12.945 --> 51:14.739
all right?

51:18.951 --> 51:21.245
Hey, Serg,

51:21.286 --> 51:23.121
hey, we need you, man.

51:37.428 --> 51:39.471
(bell rings)

51:44.977 --> 51:46.645
TRINA:

51:44.977 --> 51:46.645
Well, well, well,

51:46.687 --> 51:48.522
it's not

51:46.687 --> 51:48.522
Ms. Jackie Taylor.

51:48.564 --> 51:51.025
Oh, shut up.

51:48.564 --> 51:51.025
Hey, girl.

51:51.067 --> 51:53.277
Hey, girl.

51:53.318 --> 51:54.779
How's your

51:53.318 --> 51:54.779
mom doing?

51:54.820 --> 51:57.281
She's doing

51:54.820 --> 51:57.281
better, stable.

51:57.322 --> 51:59.867
Good.

51:59.909 --> 52:02.244
That must have

51:59.909 --> 52:02.244
been scary.

52:02.286 --> 52:05.081
You don't even

52:02.286 --> 52:05.081
want to know.

52:05.121 --> 52:06.498
Wow, Jack.

52:09.543 --> 52:11.295
Why you ain't riding

52:09.543 --> 52:11.295
home with Chris?

52:11.336 --> 52:13.631
He wasn't here

52:11.336 --> 52:13.631
today. I haven't

52:11.336 --> 52:13.631
talked to him.

52:13.672 --> 52:15.633
Y'all are so

52:13.672 --> 52:15.633
cute together.

52:15.674 --> 52:17.468
Someone should

52:15.674 --> 52:17.468
tell June that.

52:17.509 --> 52:19.678
I wish this whole

52:17.509 --> 52:19.678
"Bottom and Hill"

52:17.509 --> 52:19.678
shit would stop.

52:19.720 --> 52:21.597
Me too, girl. Don't

52:19.720 --> 52:21.597
even worry about June.

52:21.639 --> 52:23.057
He'll get over it.

52:24.558 --> 52:26.894
I never met anybody

52:24.558 --> 52:26.894
like him before.

52:26.936 --> 52:28.604
He really cares

52:26.936 --> 52:28.604
about me.

52:30.022 --> 52:31.607
Real comfortable

52:30.022 --> 52:31.607
with him, you know.

52:35.402 --> 52:38.614
OMG, did you

52:35.402 --> 52:38.614
let him hit it?

52:38.656 --> 52:40.908
Shut up.

52:40.950 --> 52:42.660
Are you serious?

52:40.950 --> 52:42.660
Can you calm down?

52:42.701 --> 52:43.661
I can't calm down.

52:43.702 --> 52:44.662
Please?

52:44.703 --> 52:46.538
I'm sorry,

52:44.703 --> 52:46.538
I'm sorry.

52:46.580 --> 52:48.082
At least you picked

52:46.580 --> 52:48.082
a winner for your

52:46.580 --> 52:48.082
first time,

52:48.124 --> 52:50.208
you know, someone

52:48.124 --> 52:50.208
who can help you out,

52:50.250 --> 52:51.502
buy you some clothes,

52:50.250 --> 52:51.502
take you to K.O.P.

52:51.543 --> 52:53.420
No, it's not

52:51.543 --> 52:53.420
even like that.

52:53.462 --> 52:54.839
Is that all,

52:53.462 --> 52:54.839
you know?

52:54.880 --> 52:55.923
I mean.

52:55.965 --> 52:57.173
We just get

52:55.965 --> 52:57.173
along good.

52:57.215 --> 52:58.550
Okay.

52:58.592 --> 53:00.176
I could care

52:58.592 --> 53:00.176
less about that.

53:00.218 --> 53:01.929
Mm-hmm,

53:01.971 --> 53:03.514
you going to

53:01.971 --> 53:03.514
care if your

53:01.971 --> 53:03.514
ass get a box

53:03.555 --> 53:06.350
of CVS candy and

53:03.555 --> 53:06.350
a little plastic

53:03.555 --> 53:06.350
rose for Christmas.

53:06.391 --> 53:08.102
So silly.

53:08.144 --> 53:10.437
I'm just trying

53:08.144 --> 53:10.437
to cheer you up.

53:10.479 --> 53:11.897
I know.

53:11.939 --> 53:13.398
Look, with all

53:11.939 --> 53:13.398
the craziness

53:13.440 --> 53:14.984
with my mom

53:13.440 --> 53:14.984
and June,

53:15.026 --> 53:16.986
Chris is just

53:15.026 --> 53:16.986
necessary.

53:19.488 --> 53:21.782
Trust me, Jack,

53:21.824 --> 53:23.868
it's gonna be okay.

53:23.909 --> 53:26.202
Everything's gonna

53:23.909 --> 53:26.202
work out just fine.

53:27.746 --> 53:29.081
Doesn't it always?

53:30.749 --> 53:32.208
I guess.

53:43.762 --> 53:45.221
Where's your brother

53:43.762 --> 53:45.221
and sister?

53:45.263 --> 53:47.599
They were here.

53:47.641 --> 53:49.018
They went to school.

53:50.477 --> 53:52.188
You're always

53:50.477 --> 53:52.188
looking out.

53:55.607 --> 53:56.817
I don't know. This time,

53:56.859 --> 53:59.945
it just--it didn't

53:56.859 --> 53:59.945
go so well, ma.

53:59.987 --> 54:02.656
Well you can't control

53:59.987 --> 54:02.656
everything, baby.

54:03.741 --> 54:05.241
I'm sorry.

54:05.283 --> 54:06.827
MRS. TAYLOR: It's

54:05.283 --> 54:06.827
not your fault.

54:08.787 --> 54:10.288
These boys are

54:08.787 --> 54:10.288
out of control,

54:10.330 --> 54:12.290
it's just one

54:10.330 --> 54:12.290
of those things.

54:14.292 --> 54:15.711
I'm fine.

54:17.963 --> 54:19.090
But I don't want

54:17.963 --> 54:19.090
you going out

54:19.131 --> 54:21.133
doing nothing

54:19.131 --> 54:21.133
stupid, okay?

54:22.718 --> 54:24.553
What happened to Bunch

54:22.718 --> 54:24.553
hurt all of us,

54:26.430 --> 54:30.059
but God...

54:30.101 --> 54:33.187
has a way of settling

54:30.101 --> 54:33.187
things, okay?

54:34.605 --> 54:36.899
So, you let

54:34.605 --> 54:36.899
him do that,

54:40.819 --> 54:41.779
all right?

54:41.820 --> 54:43.072
Yes.

54:44.615 --> 54:47.826
I remember when

54:44.615 --> 54:47.826
you were seven,

54:47.868 --> 54:50.579
and I took you to

54:47.868 --> 54:50.579
market with me,

54:50.621 --> 54:53.749
we must have had

54:50.621 --> 54:53.749
four or five bags,

54:53.791 --> 54:56.210
four or five

54:53.791 --> 54:56.210
heavy bags,

54:56.252 --> 54:58.212
and you walked

54:56.252 --> 54:58.212
all the way

54:58.254 --> 55:00.256
to the top

54:58.254 --> 55:00.256
of the block.

55:00.296 --> 55:03.175
All them bags. And

55:00.296 --> 55:03.175
after a while,

55:03.217 --> 55:05.301
they got too heavy,

55:05.343 --> 55:07.805
but you wouldn't stop.

55:07.846 --> 55:10.306
So, I had to

55:07.846 --> 55:10.306
convince you

55:10.348 --> 55:11.809
to give me the

55:10.348 --> 55:11.809
smallest bag

55:11.850 --> 55:13.309
by telling you

55:13.351 --> 55:15.229
I had to get

55:13.351 --> 55:15.229
something out of it.

55:15.271 --> 55:17.189
I remember

55:15.271 --> 55:17.189
that, Ma, yeah.

55:29.701 --> 55:30.661
Look at me.

55:37.709 --> 55:38.669
Jackie,

55:40.504 --> 55:42.965
she's such

55:40.504 --> 55:42.965
a smart girl.

55:47.761 --> 55:51.182
I want you to let up

55:47.761 --> 55:51.182
on her a little bit,

55:51.223 --> 55:53.391
let her live

55:51.223 --> 55:53.391
a little

55:53.433 --> 55:56.520
or she'll grow

55:53.433 --> 55:56.520
to despise you.

55:56.561 --> 55:59.648
Trust me when

55:56.561 --> 55:59.648
I tell you.

56:02.776 --> 56:04.862
All right.

56:04.903 --> 56:06.280
I'm gonna do that.

56:11.743 --> 56:14.163
So, you go on and

56:11.743 --> 56:14.163
handle your business now.

56:15.789 --> 56:17.708
I'm all right here.

56:17.749 --> 56:19.877
I've been through

56:17.749 --> 56:19.877
much worse.

56:22.880 --> 56:24.923
I love you.

56:29.553 --> 56:31.429

That's an eternity

57:30.822 --> 57:32.449

57:32.490 --> 57:36.036
Do not let Richardson

57:32.490 --> 57:36.036

57:36.078 --> 57:38.414
Do not let Richardson

57:36.078 --> 57:38.414

57:38.455 --> 57:40.416
We can do this.

Yo, why are we always

59:25.729 --> 59:27.731
taking this route?

59:27.772 --> 59:29.941
Because I'm always

59:27.772 --> 59:29.941
doing pedaling

59:29.983 --> 59:31.860
so I take a shortcut.

59:31.902 --> 59:34.279
You know, I'm gonna let you

59:31.902 --> 59:34.279
slide. You did hit 60 points.

59:34.321 --> 59:36.407
That came out of nowhere.

59:36.448 --> 59:38.325
I know. They probably wanted

59:36.448 --> 59:38.325
to hit into tomorrow.

59:38.367 --> 59:40.244
Yow, we're the

59:40.285 --> 59:42.371
Yeah.

59:42.413 --> 59:44.956
Oh, I know. I was like,

59:42.413 --> 59:44.956
"Oh, my God."

59:44.998 --> 59:46.583
Whoa.

59:44.998 --> 59:46.583
Shit.

59:46.624 --> 59:48.419
Shit, baby.

01:00:00.972 --> 01:00:03.641

01:00:03.683 --> 01:00:05.102
But real talk,

I could use that money.

01:00:11.108 --> 01:00:12.443
Me, too.

01:00:14.319 --> 01:00:15.987
Money tighter

01:00:14.319 --> 01:00:15.987

Good, man. What you got to

01:00:25.038 --> 01:00:28.333

Because I'm hungry as hell.

01:00:28.375 --> 01:00:30.877
Nigga, I don't know.

01:00:28.375 --> 01:00:30.877
I hope she cooked.

01:01:04.702 --> 01:01:05.745

01:01:05.787 --> 01:01:07.789
Come on, come on. Silence.

01:01:07.831 --> 01:01:09.416
Listen up, y'all, hold on.

01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:12.669
Look here, y'all,

Look, as a family.

We came a long way

01:01:24.389 --> 01:01:26.558

01:01:24.389 --> 01:01:26.558

01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:31.271
I love y'all. I do.

01:01:31.313 --> 01:01:33.023
We love you, too.

01:01:33.064 --> 01:01:35.900
(laughs)

01:01:35.942 --> 01:01:38.236
Serg, I'm so fucking

01:01:35.942 --> 01:01:38.236
proud of you, bro.

01:01:38.278 --> 01:01:41.698
You've been working on your game

01:01:38.278 --> 01:01:41.698
since you were six-years-old.

01:01:41.739 --> 01:01:43.325
And if anyone knows, I know.

01:01:43.367 --> 01:01:44.909
I taught you

01:01:43.367 --> 01:01:44.909
all your moves, man,

01:01:44.951 --> 01:01:46.828
left hand, right hand,

01:01:44.951 --> 01:01:46.828
you know, that's me.

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:48.246
SEAN:

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:48.246
Uh, hold on

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:48.246
a second, I mean,

01:01:48.288 --> 01:01:50.915
I may know a little

01:01:48.288 --> 01:01:50.915
something too, you know.

01:01:50.957 --> 01:01:52.876
(laughs)

01:01:52.917 --> 01:01:54.503
Sean was there, too.

01:01:54.545 --> 01:01:56.421
My man.

01:01:56.463 --> 01:01:58.715
But look, hard work pays off,

01:01:58.756 --> 01:02:00.300
and I just need you

01:01:58.756 --> 01:02:00.300
to stick with it

01:02:00.342 --> 01:02:03.345
and be patient it's gonna

01:02:00.342 --> 01:02:03.345
happen, all right?

01:02:03.387 --> 01:02:05.138
And, Jackie,

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:06.682
baby girl, you so beautiful.

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:09.851
Damn. Not once around here

01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:13.355
have you gave me

01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:13.355
any problems. Not one time.

01:02:13.397 --> 01:02:15.940
I took all of that for you.

01:02:15.982 --> 01:02:18.109
I took it all for you. Yeah.

01:02:18.151 --> 01:02:22.406
But keep up the good work, okay?

01:02:22.447 --> 01:02:25.116
And don't ever give up

01:02:22.447 --> 01:02:25.116
on your dreams,

01:02:25.158 --> 01:02:26.951
never.

01:02:26.993 --> 01:02:28.995
So cheers. Keep the party going.

01:02:29.037 --> 01:02:31.289
Cheers.

01:02:29.037 --> 01:02:31.289
Give it up, y'all.

01:02:29.037 --> 01:02:31.289
Come on, now.

01:02:31.331 --> 01:02:34.959
One time for Bunch, man.

01:02:35.001 --> 01:02:36.753
(music plays)

01:02:36.794 --> 01:02:39.715
(indistinct chatter)

01:02:44.135 --> 01:02:45.679
(music plays)

01:02:47.847 --> 01:02:49.433
I'm gonna get the door.

01:02:47.847 --> 01:02:49.433
I'll be back.

01:02:58.483 --> 01:03:00.694
What's up, June?

01:03:00.736 --> 01:03:01.819
Can I talk to you

01:03:00.736 --> 01:03:01.819
for a minute?

01:03:01.861 --> 01:03:03.614
What's the trail,

01:03:01.861 --> 01:03:03.614
young blood?

01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:06.950
I just wanna say

01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:06.950
I'm sorry about

01:03:06.991 --> 01:03:08.201
everything that

01:03:06.991 --> 01:03:08.201
happened with your mom

01:03:08.243 --> 01:03:10.203
and everything that night.

01:03:10.245 --> 01:03:12.872
Is she okay?

01:03:10.245 --> 01:03:12.872
Is she doing good?

01:03:12.914 --> 01:03:14.207
Yeah, she'll be all right.

01:03:14.249 --> 01:03:16.000
That's good.

01:03:16.042 --> 01:03:18.295
You know, I didn't mean...

01:03:16.042 --> 01:03:18.295
Look, I didn't mean...

01:03:18.336 --> 01:03:20.631
Go ahead.

01:03:20.672 --> 01:03:23.925
Look, man, I know shit got crazy

01:03:20.672 --> 01:03:23.925
around there that night, man,

01:03:23.967 --> 01:03:25.677
and I ain't mean

01:03:23.967 --> 01:03:25.677
to flip the lid on you, but,

01:03:25.719 --> 01:03:27.304
you know I had to, you know,

01:03:27.345 --> 01:03:28.764
put it down, man, but, um...

01:03:27.345 --> 01:03:28.764
It's kind of crazy, man.

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:30.181
It's real crazy.

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:30.181
It's kind of crazy,

01:03:30.223 --> 01:03:31.391
but I know it was all

01:03:30.223 --> 01:03:31.391
about nothing, so.

01:03:31.433 --> 01:03:33.226
It's all about nothing, bro.

01:03:33.268 --> 01:03:36.020
But I did talk

01:03:33.268 --> 01:03:36.020
to some people

01:03:36.062 --> 01:03:38.815
about what happened.

01:03:36.062 --> 01:03:38.815
Word?

01:03:38.856 --> 01:03:41.025
I kind of came up

01:03:38.856 --> 01:03:41.025
on some information.

01:03:43.903 --> 01:03:46.281
CHRIS: They usually do

01:03:43.903 --> 01:03:46.281
a little hustle thing at...

01:03:46.323 --> 01:03:49.117
that bar, you know,

01:03:46.323 --> 01:03:49.117
on 63rd and Lebanon.

01:03:50.786 --> 01:03:52.829
How much I owe you

01:03:50.786 --> 01:03:52.829
for this, man?

01:03:54.956 --> 01:03:57.459
You don't owe me, man.

01:03:57.501 --> 01:03:58.918
I just thought

01:03:57.501 --> 01:03:58.918
you would like to know.

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:00.170
And that, I'd like to know.

01:04:00.211 --> 01:04:01.379
Well good luck on this man.

01:04:01.421 --> 01:04:02.547
I owe you something.

01:04:01.421 --> 01:04:02.547
No.

01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:04.132
Look, anything you need,

01:04:04.174 --> 01:04:05.592
you know, I want shit around...

01:04:04.174 --> 01:04:05.592
JACKIE: June, who is it?

01:04:13.642 --> 01:04:14.892
Y'all just gonna

01:04:13.642 --> 01:04:14.892
stand there?

01:04:14.934 --> 01:04:16.311
Gonna stand right

01:04:14.934 --> 01:04:16.311
in the doorway?

01:04:16.353 --> 01:04:18.605
Get in here, man.

01:04:16.353 --> 01:04:18.605
We're having a party.

01:04:18.647 --> 01:04:20.732
Talking about you,

01:04:18.647 --> 01:04:20.732
you know you're happy now.

01:04:20.774 --> 01:04:23.443
All right.

01:04:23.485 --> 01:04:25.320
(laughs)

01:04:25.362 --> 01:04:26.697
SEAN:

01:04:25.362 --> 01:04:26.697
All right, bro,

01:04:25.362 --> 01:04:26.697
I'm gonna see you tomorrow?

01:04:26.738 --> 01:04:27.698
Hey, thank you.

01:04:26.738 --> 01:04:27.698
Got my baby.

01:04:27.739 --> 01:04:29.491
Thank you. No, no, no.

01:04:29.533 --> 01:04:31.075
JACKIE:

01:04:29.533 --> 01:04:31.075
Okay. It was nice

01:04:29.533 --> 01:04:31.075
having you. Okay, baby.

01:04:31.117 --> 01:04:32.160
Ooh.

01:04:32.202 --> 01:04:33.620
Serg, I am so proud of you.

01:04:33.662 --> 01:04:35.288
Don't let this go

01:04:33.662 --> 01:04:35.288
to your head, okay?

01:04:35.330 --> 01:04:36.581
Thank you. Hey.

01:04:35.330 --> 01:04:36.581
All right?

01:04:36.623 --> 01:04:38.166
It's already big enough.

01:04:36.623 --> 01:04:38.166
Jackie,

01:04:38.208 --> 01:04:39.334
I'm gonna do your

01:04:38.208 --> 01:04:39.334
make up when you graduate.

01:04:39.376 --> 01:04:40.836
JACKIE:

01:04:39.376 --> 01:04:40.836
Yeah, we miss you.

01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:43.421
Enough already.

01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:43.421
You're too much. Once again.

01:04:43.463 --> 01:04:44.922
You 'bout to pick up the rug.

01:04:44.964 --> 01:04:46.800
Mom would kill you.

01:04:51.929 --> 01:04:54.974
You ready to put the bite

01:04:51.929 --> 01:04:54.974
down on these niggas, man?

01:04:55.016 --> 01:04:57.310
That's what

01:04:55.016 --> 01:04:57.310
I'm here to do.

01:04:57.352 --> 01:04:58.478
All right.

01:05:00.146 --> 01:05:03.066
I don't give a fuck

01:05:00.146 --> 01:05:03.066
right now, dawg.

01:05:06.110 --> 01:05:08.321
I hate these cop shows.

01:05:08.363 --> 01:05:11.032
All they do

01:05:08.363 --> 01:05:11.032
is lockup Black kids.

01:05:11.074 --> 01:05:12.283
Who else they gonna lockup?

01:05:12.325 --> 01:05:14.118
That ain't funny.

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.829
I wasn't trying to be funny.

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.829
And I bet you didn't know

01:05:15.871 --> 01:05:19.207
that most of these prisons

01:05:15.871 --> 01:05:19.207
are privately owned anyway.

01:05:19.249 --> 01:05:20.958
And?

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.169
And that means that

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.169
the jails are companies,

01:05:23.211 --> 01:05:25.171
which means

01:05:23.211 --> 01:05:25.171
they make a profit

01:05:25.213 --> 01:05:26.798
so the more people

01:05:25.213 --> 01:05:26.798
go to jail,

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:28.341
the more money

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:28.341
they make.

01:05:28.383 --> 01:05:29.885
And the fucked up thing

01:05:28.383 --> 01:05:29.885
is that the government

01:05:29.926 --> 01:05:31.887
is the ones that's

01:05:29.926 --> 01:05:31.887
giving them the money

01:05:31.928 --> 01:05:34.890
and then they get these

01:05:31.928 --> 01:05:34.890
contracts from these

01:05:31.928 --> 01:05:34.890
other companies

01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:37.308
and they get the inmates

01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:37.308
to do all the labor.

01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:38.935
That almost sounds

01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:38.935
like slavery.

01:05:38.976 --> 01:05:40.645
No, no,

01:05:40.687 --> 01:05:42.272
that's definitely slavery.

01:05:48.152 --> 01:05:50.864
What was you and

01:05:48.152 --> 01:05:50.864
my brother talking about?

01:05:50.906 --> 01:05:53.366
Just basketball stuff.

01:05:50.906 --> 01:05:53.366
He is in love with the Sixers.

01:05:53.408 --> 01:05:55.952
I'm like I'm an LA guy,

01:05:53.408 --> 01:05:55.952
it's the Lakers.

01:05:55.993 --> 01:05:58.079
I'm not talking about Serg.

01:05:58.121 --> 01:06:00.331
I'm talking about June.

01:06:00.373 --> 01:06:02.333
I mean, June is cool.

01:06:02.375 --> 01:06:03.376
We didn't talk

01:06:02.375 --> 01:06:03.376
about nothing.

01:06:03.418 --> 01:06:05.545
Do I look like I'm stupid?

01:06:05.587 --> 01:06:07.046
Well. Oh.

01:06:07.088 --> 01:06:08.924
Let me tell you something

01:06:07.088 --> 01:06:08.924
about my brother.

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:10.341
He'll do anything for you,

01:06:10.383 --> 01:06:12.552
but as soon as you

01:06:10.383 --> 01:06:12.552
piss him off,

01:06:12.594 --> 01:06:14.638
you got big problems.

01:06:14.679 --> 01:06:17.223
JACKIE:

01:06:14.679 --> 01:06:17.223
Don't get me wrong,

01:06:14.679 --> 01:06:17.223
I love my brother,

01:06:17.265 --> 01:06:19.935
but you don't to be

01:06:17.265 --> 01:06:19.935
hanging around with him

01:06:17.265 --> 01:06:19.935
and his friends.

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:22.854
You ain't nothing like him.

01:06:22.896 --> 01:06:25.273
They're gangsters, Chris.

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:26.608
And he takes care

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:26.608
of his business

01:06:26.650 --> 01:06:28.819
and us by any means.

01:06:30.904 --> 01:06:32.155
They don't fuck around.

01:06:33.657 --> 01:06:35.325
(gunshots)

01:06:50.715 --> 01:06:51.842
(groans)

01:07:34.509 --> 01:07:37.428
(indistinct chatter)

01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:40.682
WOMAN: Hey, girl.

01:07:40.724 --> 01:07:42.141
MAN: Hello, Serg.

01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:45.520
("Best of Me,"

01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:45.520
by Anthony Hamilton, playing)

01:07:53.194 --> 01:07:55.530
("Best of Me,"

01:07:53.194 --> 01:07:55.530
by Anthony Hamilton, playing)

01:08:14.173 --> 01:08:16.509
("Best of Me,"

01:08:14.173 --> 01:08:16.509
by Anthony Hamilton, playing)

01:08:33.734 --> 01:08:35.862
(upbeat music plays)

01:08:40.658 --> 01:08:42.953
Attention, attention, attention.

01:08:42.993 --> 01:08:46.081
Students, no more

01:08:42.993 --> 01:08:46.081
of that dirty dancing,

01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:47.540
young man, I'm watching you.

01:08:47.582 --> 01:08:49.166
I'm watching you.

01:08:49.207 --> 01:08:51.586
All right. I hate

01:08:49.207 --> 01:08:51.586
to disturb the fun

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:55.506
but as we celebrate

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:55.506
the 25th Annual...

01:08:55.548 --> 01:08:57.508
Brook Ball.

01:08:57.550 --> 01:08:59.636
All right?

01:08:59.676 --> 01:09:02.138
Twenty-five years,

01:09:02.179 --> 01:09:04.057
and...

01:09:04.099 --> 01:09:05.809
we've had an awesome year

01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:08.394
starting with

01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:08.394
the accomplishments of our...

01:09:08.435 --> 01:09:09.604
basketball team.

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:11.564
(cheers and applauses)

01:09:13.274 --> 01:09:14.818
Very...

01:09:14.859 --> 01:09:17.069
I'm very, very proud

01:09:14.859 --> 01:09:17.069
of these young men,

01:09:17.112 --> 01:09:21.073
but undoubtedly they could not

01:09:17.112 --> 01:09:21.073
have done it without...

01:09:21.116 --> 01:09:24.618
focus, lots of focus, right?

01:09:24.661 --> 01:09:26.328
So...

01:09:26.370 --> 01:09:28.372
without any further

01:09:26.370 --> 01:09:28.372
ado or delay,

01:09:28.413 --> 01:09:31.584
ladies and gentlemen,

01:09:28.413 --> 01:09:31.584
let's get right to...

01:09:31.626 --> 01:09:33.544
our Brook Ball...

01:09:33.586 --> 01:09:36.506
King and Queen for this year.

01:09:36.546 --> 01:09:38.091
Okay.

01:09:38.133 --> 01:09:39.801
My boy Serg.

01:09:39.843 --> 01:09:42.386
So ladies and gentlemen,

01:09:42.428 --> 01:09:45.430
please put your hands

01:09:42.428 --> 01:09:45.430

01:09:45.473 --> 01:09:47.642
Brook Ball King,

01:09:47.684 --> 01:09:50.728
Mr. Chris Collins.

01:09:50.770 --> 01:09:53.689
(cheers and applauses)

01:10:10.498 --> 01:10:13.751
And this next young lady,

01:10:10.498 --> 01:10:13.751
I'm so proud of her.

01:10:13.793 --> 01:10:15.461
She's been through a lot, but...

01:10:15.503 --> 01:10:18.339
she has shown

01:10:15.503 --> 01:10:18.339
tremendous character,

01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:20.341
tremendous intelligence

01:10:20.383 --> 01:10:22.552
and Stick-to-itiveness

01:10:20.383 --> 01:10:22.552
most importantly

01:10:22.593 --> 01:10:24.512
ladies and gentlemen please

01:10:22.593 --> 01:10:24.512
put your hands together

01:10:24.554 --> 01:10:27.640
for the Brook Ball Queen,

01:10:27.682 --> 01:10:29.100
Jackie Taylor, baby.

01:10:29.142 --> 01:10:32.062
(cheers and applauses)

01:10:37.525 --> 01:10:38.860
All right. Give it up.

01:10:37.525 --> 01:10:38.860
SERGIO:

01:10:37.525 --> 01:10:38.860
Did you push her back?

01:10:38.902 --> 01:10:40.987
Give it up. Give it up.

01:10:56.002 --> 01:10:58.838
So in the illustrious words

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:01.298
of our Lord and Savior,

01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:03.259
party on, dude.

01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:06.221
(cheers and applauses)

01:11:11.726 --> 01:11:12.852
Yeah. Hey, give it up.

01:11:12.894 --> 01:11:15.230
Give it up. Come on, give it up.

01:11:27.324 --> 01:11:28.868
DEZ:

01:11:27.324 --> 01:11:28.868
All right, look,

01:11:27.324 --> 01:11:28.868
if we leave right now,

01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:31.246
we'll still make it back

01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:31.246
before it's over.

01:11:32.997 --> 01:11:35.208
Are you ready?

01:11:35.250 --> 01:11:37.710
I don't know. Really--

01:11:35.250 --> 01:11:37.710
I really haven't even

01:11:35.250 --> 01:11:37.710
thought about this shit.

01:11:37.752 --> 01:11:39.378
I really don't, though.

01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:42.339
Look, Serg, I know

01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:42.339
you don't wanna do this shit.

01:11:42.381 --> 01:11:44.884
I don't wanna do this shit,

01:11:42.381 --> 01:11:44.884
but we need this money.

01:11:44.926 --> 01:11:47.553
All you got to do is help us

01:11:44.926 --> 01:11:47.553
carry some things out the house

01:11:47.595 --> 01:11:49.764
and we'll still split

01:11:47.595 --> 01:11:49.764
the money three-ways.

01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:57.939
All right.

01:17:05.079 --> 01:17:06.956
No strings attached.

01:17:06.997 --> 01:17:09.333
You know, June, when I...

01:17:09.375 --> 01:17:11.210

I thought it would be easy.

01:17:14.130 --> 01:17:15.965
What you mean, man?

01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:23.639

MAN: All right.

01:18:00.593 --> 01:18:02.219
JUNE: Yo, yo, yo,

01:18:00.593 --> 01:18:02.219
yo, hold up, bro.

01:18:02.261 --> 01:18:03.720
What the fuck y'all

01:18:02.261 --> 01:18:03.720
doing under the table, man?

01:18:03.762 --> 01:18:04.930
Y'all think I'm slow, man?

01:18:04.972 --> 01:18:06.682
What the fuck

01:18:04.972 --> 01:18:06.682
is you talking about?

01:18:06.723 --> 01:18:08.601
Look, you know what the fuck

01:18:06.723 --> 01:18:08.601
I'm talking about, bro.

01:18:08.643 --> 01:18:09.810
Y'all niggas'

01:18:08.643 --> 01:18:09.810
cheating, man.

01:18:09.852 --> 01:18:11.270
(doorbell rings)

01:18:11.312 --> 01:18:12.938
Nobody gotta

01:18:11.312 --> 01:18:12.938
cheat you, dawg.

01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:14.815
You on our

01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:14.815
side of the bridge,

01:18:14.857 --> 01:18:16.692
stop acting like

01:18:14.857 --> 01:18:16.692
a little bitch.

01:18:16.733 --> 01:18:18.653
Fuck y'all little

01:18:16.733 --> 01:18:18.653
card game, nigga.

01:18:18.694 --> 01:18:20.154
(laughing)

01:18:20.196 --> 01:18:21.405
Hey, yo, June,

01:18:21.447 --> 01:18:23.199
when you come back,

01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:25.493
make sure you bring

01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:25.493
some more money, all right?

01:18:28.704 --> 01:18:30.289
You back again?

01:18:30.331 --> 01:18:31.957
How much money

01:18:30.331 --> 01:18:31.957
you trying to lose?

01:18:31.999 --> 01:18:33.125
None.

01:18:52.895 --> 01:18:54.230
Come on, man,

01:18:54.271 --> 01:18:55.648
we was just

01:18:54.271 --> 01:18:55.648
playing.

01:19:12.248 --> 01:19:13.583
You June's sister, right?

01:19:13.624 --> 01:19:14.625
Yeah.

01:19:17.211 --> 01:19:19.004
So this is where

01:19:17.211 --> 01:19:19.004
the magic happens, huh?

01:19:19.046 --> 01:19:20.256
I guess so.

01:19:23.259 --> 01:19:25.386
Do you know how long I've been

01:19:23.259 --> 01:19:25.386
waiting for you? Where were you?

01:19:25.428 --> 01:19:27.638
I had to put

01:19:25.428 --> 01:19:27.638
together something.

01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:30.015
(gunshot)

01:19:30.057 --> 01:19:31.100
June.

01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:34.978
(sirens wailing)

01:19:51.287 --> 01:19:54.206
JACKIE:

01:19:51.287 --> 01:19:54.206
I love you.

01:19:51.287 --> 01:19:54.206
I love you. Oh, June.

01:19:55.291 --> 01:19:57.460
Please, please, please.

01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:05.676
JACKIE:

01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:05.676
I couldn't believe it.

01:20:05.718 --> 01:20:07.595
Our brother was gone.

01:20:07.637 --> 01:20:11.181
All I could think about was,

01:20:07.637 --> 01:20:11.181
"God, please wake me up,"

01:20:11.223 --> 01:20:13.559
but he didn't. It was real.

01:20:15.770 --> 01:20:18.522
People make choices

01:20:15.770 --> 01:20:18.522
that we know aren't right,

01:20:18.564 --> 01:20:20.816
but we still do 'em.

01:20:20.857 --> 01:20:23.193
And we live with

01:20:20.857 --> 01:20:23.193
the consequences.

01:20:33.621 --> 01:20:35.164
Hey.

01:20:35.205 --> 01:20:36.791
Hey.

01:20:36.832 --> 01:20:38.375
You okay?

01:20:38.417 --> 01:20:39.960
Yeah, I'm good.

01:20:42.838 --> 01:20:44.799
You got some mail.

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:47.050
From who?

01:20:47.092 --> 01:20:48.302
You know who.

01:20:51.472 --> 01:20:53.474
SERGIO:

01:20:51.472 --> 01:20:53.474
Hey, hey. We gonna

01:20:51.472 --> 01:20:53.474
go see grandma.

01:20:57.812 --> 01:20:59.855
JACKIE:

01:20:57.812 --> 01:20:59.855
Serg,

01:20:59.896 --> 01:21:02.316
I'm proud of you.

01:21:02.358 --> 01:21:03.400
We all are.

01:21:04.901 --> 01:21:06.529
I love you.

01:21:06.570 --> 01:21:08.447
I love you, too.

01:21:08.489 --> 01:21:10.533
Let's go see grandma.

01:21:10.574 --> 01:21:12.159
Let's go see grandma.

01:21:28.925 --> 01:21:31.178
CHRIS: Dear Jackie,

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:33.305
it's been two years,

01:21:33.347 --> 01:21:34.807
six months, and four days

01:21:34.849 --> 01:21:37.351
since I last seen

01:21:34.849 --> 01:21:37.351
or heard from you.

01:21:37.393 --> 01:21:40.521
I've written what seems to be

01:21:37.393 --> 01:21:40.521
hundreds of letters and...

01:21:40.563 --> 01:21:43.232
Not even sure if you've

01:21:40.563 --> 01:21:43.232
read one of them, but...

01:21:43.273 --> 01:21:45.150
I'll still write them.

01:21:45.192 --> 01:21:47.361
Every night I replay

01:21:45.192 --> 01:21:47.361
the chain of events

01:21:47.403 --> 01:21:49.112
that led me to where I'm at.

01:21:49.154 --> 01:21:51.073
When June killed

01:21:49.154 --> 01:21:51.073
my cousin Omar,

01:21:51.114 --> 01:21:53.534
I knew I was supposed

01:21:51.114 --> 01:21:53.534
to die right there with him.

01:21:53.576 --> 01:21:56.161
He would have killed me

01:21:53.576 --> 01:21:56.161
with no hesitation.

01:21:56.203 --> 01:21:58.664
I was so upset that

01:21:56.203 --> 01:21:58.664
I vowed to get him.

01:21:58.706 --> 01:22:00.708
I know you won't

01:21:58.706 --> 01:22:00.708
understand, but...

01:22:00.750 --> 01:22:02.459
Omar was like my bother.

01:22:02.501 --> 01:22:04.545
I loved him so much

01:22:04.587 --> 01:22:06.589
just as much

01:22:04.587 --> 01:22:06.589
as you loved June.

01:22:06.630 --> 01:22:08.591
The more I replay it,

01:22:06.630 --> 01:22:08.591
the more...

01:22:08.632 --> 01:22:10.384
I know I shouldn't

01:22:08.632 --> 01:22:10.384
have done it.

01:22:10.426 --> 01:22:12.845
At the time,

01:22:10.426 --> 01:22:12.845
I was so caught up...

01:22:12.887 --> 01:22:14.179
with all the hurt,

01:22:14.221 --> 01:22:15.890
oh, just crazy I ended up

01:22:15.931 --> 01:22:18.058
bringing the same pain

01:22:15.931 --> 01:22:18.058
to you and your and your family

01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:20.102
and I'm sorry for that.

01:22:20.143 --> 01:22:23.397
I know I can't do nothing to

01:22:20.143 --> 01:22:23.397
change my situation now, but...

01:22:23.439 --> 01:22:25.524
I hope you can move on

01:22:23.439 --> 01:22:25.524
with your life.

01:22:25.566 --> 01:22:28.026
I dream about us

01:22:25.566 --> 01:22:28.026
all the time, Jackie,

01:22:28.068 --> 01:22:30.905
us getting married,

01:22:28.068 --> 01:22:30.905
bein' successful,

01:22:30.946 --> 01:22:32.865
and maybe even having a kid.

01:22:32.907 --> 01:22:34.909
But I know it was just a dream,

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:36.993
which is all I have in here.

01:22:37.035 --> 01:22:39.955
That, and, of course

01:22:37.035 --> 01:22:39.955
the time we spent together.

01:22:39.996 --> 01:22:41.916
I see Serg went to the league.

01:22:41.957 --> 01:22:43.459
I knew he was gonna make it.

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:45.544
I saw his first

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:45.544
game the other night.

01:22:45.586 --> 01:22:47.337
He killed it.

01:22:47.379 --> 01:22:49.506
But I'm not gonna

01:22:47.379 --> 01:22:49.506
hold you up much longer.

01:22:49.548 --> 01:22:51.634
But before I go,

01:22:51.675 --> 01:22:53.051
I wanna say, Jackie,

01:22:53.093 --> 01:22:55.095
live your dreams, baby,

01:22:55.137 --> 01:22:57.013
live your dreams.

01:22:57.055 --> 01:22:59.266
And know that

01:22:57.055 --> 01:22:59.266
I'll always love you.

01:22:59.308 --> 01:23:01.351
I know I never

01:22:59.308 --> 01:23:01.351
said it before,

01:23:01.393 --> 01:23:02.978
but I always meant to...

01:23:04.187 --> 01:23:05.522
everyday.

01:23:08.651 --> 01:23:11.570
(cries)
