Congratulations.
You're the new manager.

I'm done with this plate.

01:00.443 --> 01:02.321
Ugh. I wish
I didn't have to leave,

01:02.356 --> 01:04.536
but I have to get up
so early tomorrow.

Show choir's performing

01:05.555 --> 01:08.017
at the Little Betty Snack
cake factory in the morning.

01:08.052 --> 01:09.821
We get to wear hairnets
and everything.

01:10.175 --> 01:11.061
Lucky!

01:12.314 --> 01:15.334
Well...

01:30.178 --> 01:32.370
I just don't understand
Christmas.

01:32.445 --> 01:34.197
It's like we're
supposed to be happy,

01:34.232 --> 01:35.944
but how can
we possibly enjoy it

01:36.004 --> 01:38.517
knowing that
it's all so... fleeting?

01:38.918 --> 01:40.354
(whispers)
<i>Fleeting.</i>

01:40.820 --> 01:43.179
Brick, what are you
talkin' about?

01:43.214 --> 01:45.034
You <i>love</i> Christmas.

01:45.566 --> 01:46.593
(normal voice) Do I?

01:48.236 --> 01:51.196
<i>Ah, the first tradition</i>
<i>of the holiday season--</i>

01:51.231 --> 01:53.154
<i>The putting off</i>

01:54.562 --> 01:55.986

01:56.266 --> 01:58.381
¶ La la la la la la la ¶

01:58.416 --> 01:59.393
(whispering) But he's 8.

01:59.394 --> 02:01.862
8-year-olds are supposed
to be happy at Christmas.

02:02.292 --> 02:04.531
¶ La la la la la la la ¶

02:04.566 --> 02:06.733
Plus he's whispering
to himself more often.

02:07.079 --> 02:08.353
(whispering)
Don't let it stress you out.

02:08.364 --> 02:09.449
Yeah, that's easy
for you to say.

02:09.484 --> 02:11.821
You don't have kids.
Trust me, as a parent,

02:11.856 --> 02:14.237
you're only as happy
as your least happy kid.

02:14.645 --> 02:17.800
¶ La la la la la la la ¶

02:17.835 --> 02:20.358
- Thank God I don't have kids.
MAN: I'm so proud of you.

02:20.359 --> 02:23.237
- I just roam the Earth alone.
MAN: Shh!

02:24.381 --> 02:25.966
Eyes on me, please,
people.

02:26.032 --> 02:28.690
Thank you. As you know,
next week we'll be having

02:28.725 --> 02:30.557
tryouts for
the midnight mass solo.

02:30.703 --> 02:33.139
I don't know why they even
bother with tryouts.

02:33.174 --> 02:35.589
Everybody knows Melanie Howard's
just gonna get it anyway.

02:35.661 --> 02:38.062
(scoffs) Tell me about it.
Voice like an angel

02:38.097 --> 02:40.246
and married to an orthodontist.
She's so friggin' blessed.

02:40.281 --> 02:42.131
MAN: (whispers) Shh! Quiet.
MAN: I'll see you at the tryouts.

02:42.166 --> 02:45.191
Oh, and I have
some sad news.

02:46.616 --> 02:48.837
Melanie Howard
has throat polyps!

02:48.872 --> 02:49.476
(whispers) Yes!

02:50.264 --> 02:52.237
You didn't get this excited
when my uncle had 'em.

02:52.272 --> 02:55.796
Ohh. I have been in
that choir for 15 years,

02:55.831 --> 03:00.020
and for 15 years, Melanie Howard
has hogged all the solos.

03:00.340 --> 03:03.813
Now she has polyps,
and the field is <i>wide</i> open.

03:04.685 --> 03:05.797
Oh. There you are.

03:05.838 --> 03:07.262
Oh, ahoy, matey!

03:07.406 --> 03:09.172
So I signed you up
to bring in pies

03:09.207 --> 03:11.861
for the Team Christmas party,
which is tonight at 8:00, and, uh...

03:11.911 --> 03:13.569
I'm out of underwear.
(chuckles)

03:15.014 --> 03:16.335
But you said you would
take me to the mall

03:16.336 --> 03:17.630
to pick out
Brad's Christmas present.

03:18.063 --> 03:21.260
He said he wanted body scrub
with papaya and ylang-ylang.

03:22.221 --> 03:24.089
Okay, I'll take you
to the mall.

03:24.220 --> 03:24.874
Thank you.

03:25.491 --> 03:26.494
(sighs)

03:26.892 --> 03:30.218
Who am I kidding? There's no way
I can try out for that solo.

03:30.600 --> 03:31.133
Why not?

03:31.685 --> 03:34.068
Because a s-solo involves
a lot of extra practices,

03:34.103 --> 03:35.806
and I just can't
take that on right now.

03:35.835 --> 03:38.606
It's Christmas! It's the most
stressful holiday of the year.

03:38.641 --> 03:40.803
- I can do it.
- Do what?

03:41.140 --> 03:42.638
Handle Christmas.

03:42.673 --> 03:45.104
Oh, right.
You can handle Christmas?

03:45.569 --> 03:47.485
(chuckles)
You can't handle Christmas.

03:48.467 --> 03:50.772
All you gotta do
is get organized.

03:51.047 --> 03:52.924
Your problem is
you're not organized.

03:53.276 --> 03:54.252
You don't even make lists.

03:54.601 --> 03:56.980
Right, that's my problem.
I'm not organized.

03:56.981 --> 04:00.402
I happen to have a pocketful of
Post-Its that says otherwise.

04:00.962 --> 04:01.542
Trust me, Mike,

04:01.961 --> 04:05.305
you have no idea
what Christmas involves.

04:05.340 --> 04:09.106
There is shopping, wrapping,
baking, taking the aunts

04:09.141 --> 04:11.143
to the Assisted Living
Christmas dance.

04:11.178 --> 04:12.542
Sounds like
a piece of cake.

04:12.543 --> 04:15.797
I'm on a holiday schedule
till New Year's. Bring it <i>on.</i>

04:15.800 --> 04:16.926
What was
the first thing--

04:16.961 --> 04:17.878
- Shopping?
- Yeah.

04:17.928 --> 04:21.438
Hey, Axl, I'm going to the mall.
Did you do your Christmas list?

04:21.892 --> 04:23.928
Cash, a cell phone
and to be left alone.

04:25.312 --> 04:25.916
Brick.

04:26.589 --> 04:27.993
Did you make your list
for Santa?

04:29.003 --> 04:31.526
What I really want this year
are some answers.

04:31.682 --> 04:32.024
(door closes)

04:32.059 --> 04:34.063
What's the true meaning
of Christmas?

04:34.626 --> 04:36.079
Are we here
for a reason?

04:36.754 --> 04:38.293
What is
the purpose of life?

04:39.322 --> 04:40.576
How about a bike?

04:43.061 --> 04:44.960
(0rgan playing)

04:44.961 --> 04:46.596
(lowers voice) Hey, Mom,
can I ask you something?

04:46.597 --> 04:47.069
Sure.

04:47.591 --> 04:50.260
The thing is, Brad and I have
been going out for a month now,

04:50.611 --> 04:52.065
and he still
hasn't kissed me.

04:52.407 --> 04:53.554
(lowers voice)
I sure like that kid.

04:54.166 --> 04:57.849
(lowers voice)
Well, maybe he's just shy,

04:58.689 --> 05:01.028
or, you know,
a gentleman.

05:02.164 --> 05:04.527
Yeah.
Yeah, that's probably it.

05:04.674 --> 05:06.935
Did you know he owns
his own top hat and tails?

05:07.811 --> 05:09.297
- Wow.
- Oh, nice.

05:09.990 --> 05:12.486
<i>Maybe we should have told Sue</i>
<i>the truth about Brad.</i>

05:12.877 --> 05:13.805
<i>But it was</i>
<i>a little hard to do</i>

05:13.840 --> 05:15.761
<i>when Brad didn't even</i>
<i>know the truth yet.</i>

05:17.086 --> 05:18.539
Welcome, friends.

05:19.055 --> 05:22.092
Before we begin,
please join me in praying

05:22.153 --> 05:25.195
for a member of our congregation--
Melanie Howard.

05:25.495 --> 05:29.991
May she make a quick recovery
from her throat polyps.

05:35.017 --> 05:36.663
<i>People talk about</i>
<i>the power of prayer.</i>

05:37.073 --> 05:38.077
<i>But there's something</i>
<i>to be said</i>

05:38.137 --> 05:40.022
<i>for the power</i>
<i>of not prayer as well.</i>

05:40.171 --> 05:43.045
Hey, everybody!
I got the solo! Whoo-hoo!

05:43.046 --> 05:44.542
- Hey, that's great!
- Yeah, baby! (claps hands)

05:44.732 --> 05:46.852
- Congratulations.
- Ohh.

05:47.750 --> 05:47.931
(pats back)

05:48.708 --> 05:51.495
Mike...
you put up the tree?

05:51.496 --> 05:53.417
Yep.
Took me 20 minutes.

05:53.418 --> 05:55.140
I don't know why it
always takes you so long.

05:55.992 --> 05:57.742
But I like putting up
the tree.

05:57.822 --> 05:59.728
It's one of
my favorite things.

05:59.729 --> 06:01.465
It's something
we all do together.

06:01.931 --> 06:03.875
Hey, did everyone
break an arm?

06:03.876 --> 06:05.965
How come I'm the only one
decorating the tree?

06:08.304 --> 06:09.990
Just think of
all the time I saved you.

06:09.991 --> 06:12.300
I should check this
off the list.

06:12.942 --> 06:14.779
Tree... check.

06:15.570 --> 06:17.069
I'm kicking Christmas' ass.

06:17.614 --> 06:20.049
<i>Well, Mike was handling</i>
<i>Christmas all right.</i>

06:20.446 --> 06:22.680
<i>Problem was he was</i>
<i>handling it a little too well.</i>

06:22.819 --> 06:25.541
Mike, why is there a snowman
in the front yard?

06:25.789 --> 06:26.582
You're welcome.

06:27.624 --> 06:30.004
But I <i>love</i>
making the snowman.

06:30.039 --> 06:31.388
It is my favorite thing,

06:31.423 --> 06:33.334
something
we all do together.

06:34.411 --> 06:36.890
In case anybody cares,
I just made the damn snowman.

06:38.868 --> 06:40.772
Hey, you said you wanted me
to take care of Christmas.

06:40.807 --> 06:42.035
I'm taking care
of Christmas.

06:43.140 --> 06:45.272
Hey, Dad!

06:45.408 --> 06:48.006
Major upgrade
on the snowman.

06:48.486 --> 06:49.821
Think I might actually
wait a few days

06:49.892 --> 06:51.839
before I smash it
with my baseball bat.

06:52.622 --> 06:54.064
Thanks, buddy.
How's work?

06:54.517 --> 06:57.440
Awesome. My friends came by
and called me a seaman.

06:58.093 --> 06:59.564
Livin' the dream.

06:59.822 --> 07:00.949
(sighs)

07:02.492 --> 07:03.448
FRANKIE: Brick?

07:04.504 --> 07:06.007
Brick, what are you doing
under there?

07:06.596 --> 07:10.009
Looking at the lights, but their
beauty just makes me sad.

07:10.433 --> 07:12.029
I know what will get you
in the Christmas spirit.

07:12.030 --> 07:13.444
How about a visit
with Santa Claus?

07:13.479 --> 07:15.187
Sure.
It's worth a shot.

07:15.538 --> 07:18.067
Wait. You're taking him
to see Santa?

07:18.348 --> 07:19.405
It's next on my list.

07:19.607 --> 07:20.836
I'm tellin' ya,
the way I'm going,

07:20.897 --> 07:22.576
I could have Christmas
wrapped up two days early.

07:22.577 --> 07:23.790
I don't know what you're
always complaining about.

07:23.791 --> 07:26.760
No, hang on.
I'm taking Brick to see Santa.

07:26.761 --> 07:29.300
You can't go doing
all the fun stuff, Mike.

07:29.952 --> 07:31.494
I never looked at it
that way.

07:32.719 --> 07:35.447
I guess it is all
sort of futile, isn't it?

07:37.660 --> 07:38.502
(sighs)

07:42.298 --> 07:44.446
Here, taste this. I want to see
if there's enough cinnamon.

07:44.481 --> 07:45.218
Okay.

07:49.101 --> 07:49.890
Don't move.

07:56.012 --> 07:57.314
Your lips
are really chapped.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.258
(grunts)

08:00.271 --> 08:01.837
Is that lipstick?

08:02.529 --> 08:04.303
God, why does everybody
always ask me that?

08:04.374 --> 08:05.744
It is glossy chapstick.

08:07.523 --> 08:09.007
- (door slides open)
- (sighs)

08:09.390 --> 08:09.893
Hi, kids.

08:09.944 --> 08:11.233
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, Mrs. Heck.

08:12.261 --> 08:14.599
- (door slides close)
- Oh, my God. Mike!

08:15.473 --> 08:16.489
The Christmas village?

08:16.490 --> 08:18.637
I love setting up
the Christmas village.

08:20.943 --> 08:23.458
All right, this is chaos.

08:24.093 --> 08:25.010
The guy
with the newspaper

08:25.099 --> 08:26.477
is supposed to go
in front of the bakery.

08:26.482 --> 08:27.498
You got him lurking
around the school

08:27.549 --> 08:28.825
like he's some kind
of pedophile.

08:28.826 --> 08:31.028
And look, you got the carolers
on the train track--

08:31.063 --> 08:32.822
like that's gonna end well.

08:33.472 --> 08:34.691
Did you want
my help or not?

08:34.692 --> 08:37.058
Well, yes, but I can't leave
the house for a second

08:37.150 --> 08:39.628
to go to work or practice
without you churning out

08:39.663 --> 08:40.934
some other
Christmas tradition.

08:41.163 --> 08:42.929
I just wanted you to do
the crummy stuff, you know?

08:42.931 --> 08:44.986
Go to the grocery,
stand in line at the post office

08:45.056 --> 08:45.767
for the Christmas stamps.

08:45.828 --> 08:48.106
I don't want you hogging up
all the fun stuff.

08:48.107 --> 08:50.813
How am I supposed to know
what you think is fun?

08:50.848 --> 08:52.532
Well, okay. You know
how there are songs

08:52.567 --> 08:54.436
about decorating a tree
or building a snowman?

08:54.612 --> 08:57.496
That's how you know.
If it's in a song, don't do it.

08:57.746 --> 09:00.068
So no chestnuts roasting
on an open fire.

09:00.069 --> 09:01.611
- No.
- No dashing through the snow.

09:01.663 --> 09:03.218
No, that's all out.

09:03.219 --> 09:04.496
Okay, but you know
what you <i>can</i> do?

09:04.853 --> 09:07.484
Fix Brick.
He is bumming everyone out.

09:07.519 --> 09:09.070
He even brought down Santa.

09:09.350 --> 09:11.224
"Fix Brick."
It's on the list.

09:12.460 --> 09:14.131
(whispers indistinctly)

09:14.552 --> 09:16.015
Ohh.
I liked it the other way.

09:16.287 --> 09:17.632
<i>Not a moment too soon,</i>

09:17.667 --> 09:20.334
<i>because Christmas Eve was here,</i>
<i>and there was no stopping it.</i>

09:22.573 --> 09:25.757
I have just come from rehearsal,
and I can safely say

09:25.792 --> 09:28.952
that I am going to blow the roof
off that church tonight.

09:30.819 --> 09:32.584
Hey, Brick!
You ready for Santa?

09:34.738 --> 09:35.366
I...

09:35.852 --> 09:37.143
Brick, what's the matter?

09:43.716 --> 09:45.612
(marker squeaks)

09:53.926 --> 09:54.345
Mike.

09:55.341 --> 09:56.895
Why isn't Brick talking?

09:58.119 --> 09:59.916
Yeah, I thought you might
ask about that.

09:59.996 --> 10:01.646
I had that little chat
with him,

10:02.014 --> 10:03.266
trying to get him
out of his funk.

10:03.917 --> 10:05.792
Hey, buddy.
We need to talk.

10:10.123 --> 10:11.116
(grunts)

10:11.940 --> 10:12.856
What's going on?

10:12.955 --> 10:14.308
Your mom and I
are worried about you.

10:14.427 --> 10:16.212
I'm just a little melancholy.

10:17.116 --> 10:18.936
(whispers)
<i>Melancholy.</i>

10:19.132 --> 10:20.394
When did all this start?

10:20.867 --> 10:22.553
(normal voice) You know
that Santa Pez dispenser I got

10:22.603 --> 10:24.680
two years ago, where the candy
comes out of his beard?

10:25.531 --> 10:27.363
I just started thinking
about how I had it,

10:27.398 --> 10:29.819
and then one day,
it was just... gone.

10:30.126 --> 10:32.427
And then I started thinking
that someday, you'll be gone,

10:32.488 --> 10:34.637
and I'll be gone
and we'll all be gone.

10:35.114 --> 10:37.212
Well, sure.
Everybody worries about death.

10:37.274 --> 10:39.702
It's terrifying.
But you know what we do?

10:39.952 --> 10:41.578
We shove it
out of our minds.

10:41.921 --> 10:43.940
That's why we have
books and candy

10:43.975 --> 10:46.371
and water parks and TV.

10:46.726 --> 10:49.740
It's all just a big,
old distraction from death.

10:51.335 --> 10:52.663
So all better?

10:52.999 --> 10:53.891
Okay.

10:54.667 --> 10:56.053
(whispers) <i>Okay.</i>

10:56.369 --> 10:58.326
<i>And then, because he</i>
<i>thought he was on a roll,</i>

10:58.638 --> 10:59.739
<i>Mike got greedy.</i>

11:00.473 --> 11:02.866
Oh, and you know, if you keep
on whispering to yourself,

11:02.905 --> 11:04.674
Santa's not gonna
bring you any presents.

11:12.084 --> 11:13.571
I thought
it was worth a shot.

11:17.501 --> 11:19.962
You told Brick Santa wouldn't
bring him any presents

11:20.033 --> 11:22.363
if he doesn't stop
whispering to himself?

11:23.076 --> 11:23.937
What were you thinking?

11:24.007 --> 11:25.872
Hey, we've used Santa
as motivation before--

11:26.166 --> 11:28.499
It's time to give up pacifiers,
potty training,

11:28.534 --> 11:29.520
"Hannah Montana."

11:30.080 --> 11:32.026
I thought I could slip
the whispering thing in there.

11:32.282 --> 11:34.782
So now Brick's afraid that
if he talks at all, he'll whisper,

11:34.817 --> 11:36.921
and then Santa won't come.
That's great.

11:37.173 --> 11:39.051
I ask you to fix him,
and you busted him.

11:39.132 --> 11:40.538
And you know why?

11:40.993 --> 11:43.494
Because you rushed through it
like everything else

11:43.627 --> 11:46.696
just so you could check it off
your stupid list.

11:46.731 --> 11:48.250
Hey, I was just trying
to help.

11:48.251 --> 11:50.248
I mean, maybe I didn't
handle it exactly right,

11:50.283 --> 11:52.198
but while you're off
at choir practice,

11:52.267 --> 11:54.399
I'm here busting my butt
getting Christmas together,

11:54.490 --> 11:56.074
and let me tell you something.
Christmas is...

12:00.941 --> 12:02.666
Christmas is what, Mike?
Hmm?

12:03.200 --> 12:04.346
<i>Hard?</i>

12:04.683 --> 12:05.385
It's not hard.

12:06.218 --> 12:08.316
Admit it!
Christmas is hard.

12:08.638 --> 12:10.694
- (mouthful) It's not hard.
- Say it. Say it!

12:10.729 --> 12:13.038
Christmas is stressful
and exhausting and horrible.

12:13.073 --> 12:13.983
Say it!

12:14.018 --> 12:16.585
Ah, now it's starting
to feel like Christmas.

12:16.695 --> 12:18.021
(horn honks in distance)

12:18.364 --> 12:19.038
(sighs)

12:19.499 --> 12:21.638
Great. Now Bob's here
to pick me up.

12:25.069 --> 12:27.713
Look, Mike,
it's Christmas Eve.

12:28.214 --> 12:30.757
It's my big night. I just--
I don't want to fight.

12:30.792 --> 12:31.425
Me neither.

12:32.578 --> 12:34.488
I know you were trying.
I'm sorry.

12:34.876 --> 12:36.895
Okay. You gotta go.
You're gonna be great.

12:37.983 --> 12:41.251
Okay, listen up. Everybody
has to be there by 11:00

12:41.286 --> 12:42.534
to get a good seat.

12:43.222 --> 12:45.798
And remember, the "I only go
at Easter and Christmas" crowd

12:45.833 --> 12:47.558
is gonna be there
hogging all the seats.

12:47.628 --> 12:49.686
- So it's gonna be crowded.
- We'll be there.

12:49.979 --> 12:50.781
I love you.

12:50.816 --> 12:53.970
Just <i>please</i> be there
on time.

12:54.299 --> 12:56.019
Wouldn't miss it
for the world.

12:56.468 --> 13:00.439
- <i>("Silent Night" playing on TV)</i>
- (snoring)

13:03.675 --> 13:07.354
Oh, sorry, these are saved.
It's for my family.

13:07.389 --> 13:08.483
They're on their way.

13:12.351 --> 13:14.919
No, no. (chuckles)
You gotta get here early.

13:15.147 --> 13:16.752
You would have known
if you came more often.

13:18.824 --> 13:21.212
MAN: <i>It's 11:45</i>
<i>on Christmas Eve,</i>

13:21.247 --> 13:21.846
<i>and you're watching</i>

13:21.916 --> 13:23.000
- <i>the log channel.</i>
- Oh, no!

13:23.331 --> 13:24.392
- Oh, no!
MAN: <i>Merry Christmas.</i>

13:25.033 --> 13:26.513
Sue, Axl, Brick, get up!
We're late!

13:26.765 --> 13:29.583
What? Ooh--oh!

13:29.618 --> 13:31.119
Nice, Dad!

13:31.593 --> 13:32.532
Classic.

13:32.771 --> 13:33.847
Oh, no.

13:34.606 --> 13:35.696
Are we gonna miss it?

13:36.230 --> 13:36.942
(grunts)

13:37.204 --> 13:38.584
I'm not dressed for church!

13:38.619 --> 13:41.165
No time. Throw something on,
and let's go! Now!

13:41.467 --> 13:43.155
Oh, but what about
our present?

13:43.190 --> 13:45.329
Mom always lets us open
one present on Christmas Eve.

13:45.364 --> 13:46.649
You can open it
when we get back.

13:46.927 --> 13:48.333
Keys.
Where are my keys?

13:48.413 --> 13:49.882
But then it won't be
Christmas Eve anymore.

13:49.944 --> 13:52.621
- It'll be Christmas day!
- But she said... mm!

13:52.624 --> 13:53.598
(groans)

13:54.000 --> 13:55.607
Grab a present.
You can open it in the car.

13:55.642 --> 13:56.626
Just let's move!

13:58.219 --> 13:59.547
There are no tags
on these!

13:59.582 --> 14:02.502
Tags wasn't on my list.
Just throw 'em all in the car.

14:02.537 --> 14:04.437
We can sort 'em out on the way.
Let's just move!

14:06.161 --> 14:07.369
Brick, head for the car!

14:09.566 --> 14:10.589
I'm covered in...

14:11.510 --> 14:12.441
Come on, let's go.

14:14.747 --> 14:17.001
If your mom asks,
we couldn't find a parking spot.

14:18.104 --> 14:18.844
(yawns)

14:19.727 --> 14:20.996
This one's for Brick.

14:22.383 --> 14:23.518
Don't get too into
that book.

14:23.519 --> 14:25.549
We're all jumping out as soon
as we get to the church.

14:25.889 --> 14:26.612
(gasps)

14:26.806 --> 14:28.911
Oh, my god!
A cell phone?

14:29.058 --> 14:33.083
- Uh, that's for Axl.
- <i>Oh,</i> my God!

14:33.517 --> 14:36.775
Gimme that! This totally
doesn't suck. This is awesome.

14:37.144 --> 14:39.074
Ooh.
I gotta call Darren.

14:39.268 --> 14:41.293
Uh, not so fast. You can
only call your family,

14:41.364 --> 14:42.765
'cause you're
on the family plan.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.900
You want to call your friends,
you can pay for that yourself.

14:44.901 --> 14:48.029
- You got a job.
- Uh... I-I quit that.

14:48.125 --> 14:49.283
You quit your job? Why?

14:50.467 --> 14:52.291
It was interfering with
my studies. I don't know.

14:52.326 --> 14:53.066
What do you want
to hear?

14:55.046 --> 14:57.143
There's no present
here for me.

14:57.520 --> 15:00.161
- Did you even get me anything?
- Yes, of course we did!

15:00.389 --> 15:02.424
You got a Rihanna CD
and a "Twilight"--

15:02.576 --> 15:04.326
Well, don't tell me
what you got me!

15:06.917 --> 15:08.458
I wish
Mom had done Christmas.

15:08.493 --> 15:09.502
Well, get in line.

15:10.132 --> 15:14.163
And let us now
rejoice in song.

15:14.604 --> 15:16.492
Can we just hold
on the rejoicing

15:16.527 --> 15:18.475
just for one minute?
'Cause of my family.

15:18.476 --> 15:21.172
Listen, can you j-just go tell them
they're gonna be here.

15:21.207 --> 15:22.669
- I'm gonna try to...
- You can't do this!

15:22.843 --> 15:25.424
My family was supposed
to be here at 11:00,

15:25.459 --> 15:26.160
and they said
they would come,

15:26.195 --> 15:28.047
but I don't know why
they're not here yet. So--

15:28.271 --> 15:29.508
They said
they would be on time.

15:29.776 --> 15:31.774
Is there any way
we can just hold for...

15:32.722 --> 15:36.771
¶ O come, all ye faithful ¶

15:36.872 --> 15:40.495
¶ Joyful and triumphant ¶

15:40.563 --> 15:45.494
¶ O come ye,
o come ye to ¶

15:45.529 --> 15:49.454
FRANKIE AND CHOIR:
¶ To Bethlehem ¶

15:50.138 --> 15:54.124
¶ Come and behold him ¶

15:54.527 --> 15:58.074
¶ Born the king of angels ¶

15:58.134 --> 16:02.272
¶ O come let us adore him ¶

16:02.307 --> 16:06.695
¶ O come let us adore him ¶

16:06.730 --> 16:12.014
CHOIR:
¶ O come let us adore him ¶

16:12.087 --> 16:16.419
¶ Christ the Lord ¶

16:17.753 --> 16:19.265
(whispering)
That was beautiful.

16:19.300 --> 16:20.480
(whispers) Oh, please.

16:26.119 --> 16:27.567
<i>How</i> could you be late?

16:27.643 --> 16:29.098
It was Dad's fault.
He fell asleep.

16:29.513 --> 16:32.043
Why is that, Mike? Is it
because you were exhausted?

16:32.078 --> 16:34.009
Is it because
Christmas is <i>hard?</i>

16:34.119 --> 16:36.155
It's not hard, and we would
have been there sooner,

16:36.213 --> 16:37.996
but the kids
had to open a gift.

16:38.031 --> 16:40.659
Oh, some gift! I've
only got family minutes!

16:40.690 --> 16:41.554
- Why would I ever want to talk
- You know what?

16:41.633 --> 16:42.126
to my family?

16:42.196 --> 16:44.738
- The phone is going back anyway.
- And you opened a cell phone without me?

16:45.083 --> 16:46.388
- Mike!
- He quit his job.

16:46.468 --> 16:47.944
You quit your job?

16:47.945 --> 16:50.875
Oh, do you have any idea
how disgusting it is

16:50.947 --> 16:52.193
to have to clean up
after other people?

16:52.263 --> 16:53.600
I have some idea, yeah.

16:53.736 --> 16:55.554
Everybody stop yelling!

16:55.971 --> 16:57.309
(whispers) <i>Yelling.</i>

16:58.415 --> 17:00.570
(normal voice) Oh, no!
(whispers) <i>Oh, no!</i>

17:00.643 --> 17:03.178
(normal voice) Oh, no!
(whispers) <i>Oh, no!</i>

17:03.245 --> 17:06.823
(normal voice) I can't stop!
(whispers) <i>I can't stop!</i>

17:06.858 --> 17:09.320
- See what you did?
- What I did? What did I do?

17:09.385 --> 17:12.249
(all shouting at once)

17:12.588 --> 17:15.608
- (crunch)
- (all screaming)

17:16.492 --> 17:18.382
- Whoa!
- (gasps)

17:21.266 --> 17:23.131
- Nice driving, Dad!
- Well, you distracted him!

17:23.199 --> 17:25.805
(all shouting at once)

17:26.161 --> 17:29.204
- (thud)
- (all screaming)

17:29.517 --> 17:30.726
(tires screech)

17:30.727 --> 17:32.633
- (honk blaring)
- (gasps)

17:33.821 --> 17:35.143
(gasps)

17:35.610 --> 17:38.297
(Brick whimpers)

17:42.875 --> 17:45.332
Beautiful solo, Mom.

17:47.216 --> 17:48.321
Thank you, Sue.

17:49.725 --> 17:51.445
I, uh...
(clears throat)

17:52.323 --> 17:53.806
I like my cell phone, Dad.

17:54.860 --> 17:55.808
You're welcome, son.

17:58.357 --> 18:01.196
Frankie,
Christmas is hard.

18:02.592 --> 18:03.708
Thank you.

18:04.230 --> 18:06.553
That's all
I wanted to hear.

18:09.178 --> 18:10.835
Hey, look what I found--

18:11.480 --> 18:13.427
My Santa Pez dispenser!

18:13.549 --> 18:15.345
It slid out from
underneath the seat

18:15.380 --> 18:19.274
the second time we almost died.
It's a Christmas miracle!

18:19.815 --> 18:22.935
<i>So almost dying--twice--</i>
<i>had made the rest of us</i>

18:22.970 --> 18:24.620
<i>start thinking</i>
<i>about our own existence.</i>

18:24.940 --> 18:27.973
<i>But for Brick,</i>
<i>it made him... stop.</i>

18:28.859 --> 18:30.424
Hey, there's candy
in it!

18:30.633 --> 18:32.578
Don't eat that!
It's, like, two years...

18:33.410 --> 18:34.163
(exhales)

18:35.014 --> 18:36.255
Go ahead.

18:37.268 --> 18:39.434
<i>Was the 2-year-old</i>
<i>Pez dispenser sliding out</i>

18:39.474 --> 18:41.568
<i>from under the dirty,</i>
<i>crud-encrusted bottom</i>

18:41.569 --> 18:43.607
<i>of our car seat</i>
<i>a Christmas miracle?</i>

18:44.139 --> 18:44.953
<i>Who knows?</i>

18:45.614 --> 18:48.317
<i>I'd like to think yes,</i>
<i>'cause Brick was</i>

18:48.352 --> 18:50.522
<i>the happiest I've ever</i>
<i>seen him at Christmas.</i>

18:51.970 --> 18:53.688
No way!

18:54.046 --> 18:57.394
Santa brought me a sparkly bag
for my Pez dispenser!

18:57.526 --> 19:01.005
Uh, sorry, buddy. I think
you found one of Sue's.

19:01.630 --> 19:02.842
(mouths word)

19:02.998 --> 19:07.004
No, it was sweet.
But, uh, anyway, I gotta bounce.

19:07.325 --> 19:08.288
Hit me back later.

19:08.760 --> 19:10.411
(laughs)

19:10.951 --> 19:12.462
Oh! Bye, Aunt Edie.

19:12.497 --> 19:13.335
(beep)

19:13.806 --> 19:16.242
<i>My present was seeing Brick</i>
<i>acting normal again--</i>

19:16.554 --> 19:17.718
<i>Well, Brick normal.</i>

19:17.719 --> 19:19.467
<i>'Cause you really are</i>
<i>only as happy</i>

19:19.527 --> 19:20.928
<i>as your least happy kid.</i>

19:23.566 --> 19:26.031
(voice breaking) Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

19:26.808 --> 19:27.913
Honey, what's wrong?

19:28.324 --> 19:30.105
I went to Brad's
early this morning

19:30.140 --> 19:31.415
to give him
his Christmas present,

19:31.660 --> 19:34.638
and I found him out back
behind the shed

19:34.931 --> 19:36.252
with another boy!

19:36.866 --> 19:38.903
Uh, hey, Brick?
Why don't you go to your room?

19:39.005 --> 19:40.647
- (crying)
- Go. Go.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.398
And they were out
in the bushes,

19:44.777 --> 19:46.355
and they were taking turns--

19:46.390 --> 19:48.844
Honey, I am so sorry.
We should have said something.

19:49.186 --> 19:51.586
And they were...
And they were...

19:52.081 --> 19:53.707
smoking!

19:57.450 --> 19:59.959
- Oh!
- Oh!

20:00.556 --> 20:02.134
Wait. You knew?

20:02.691 --> 20:04.260
You knew
he was a smoker?

20:04.694 --> 20:06.338
We had our suspicions.

20:06.996 --> 20:09.738
I'll bet that's why
he didn't kiss you.

20:09.798 --> 20:12.469
He didn't want you to notice
his smoker's breath.

20:12.501 --> 20:14.445
Oh, yeah.

20:15.635 --> 20:17.962
Well, there's no way
I'm gonna date him now.

20:18.865 --> 20:20.599
And I really,
really liked him, too.

20:20.634 --> 20:22.271
Oh, come here, baby.

20:23.661 --> 20:25.340
Maybe I can get him
to quit?

20:28.262 --> 20:29.832
I wouldn't count on it,
honey.

20:30.614 --> 20:31.200
Come on.

20:32.788 --> 20:35.596
<i>"Don't get me wrong.</i>
<i>Christmas is hard.</i>

20:35.939 --> 20:37.315
<i>"But no matter</i>
<i>how stressed you are,</i>

20:37.375 --> 20:39.514
<i>"the 25th rolls around,</i>
<i>and it's great</i>

20:39.575 --> 20:41.609
<i>"and wonderful</i>
<i>and the best Christmas ever.</i>

20:42.390 --> 20:44.522
<i>"It's like giving birth--</i>
<i>you forget the pain,</i>

20:44.612 --> 20:46.435
<i>"and can't wait</i>
<i>to do it again next year.</i>

20:47.810 --> 20:50.305
<i>Happy holidays.</i>
<i>Love, the Hecks."</i>
