WEBVTT

00:05.739 --> 00:07.975
Man:
PREVIOUSLY ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.076 --> 00:10.178
MY FATHER HAS ALWAYS
BEEN THERE FOR ME.

00:10.278 --> 00:12.113
HIS STUDIO WAS AT HOME,

00:12.213 --> 00:14.415
SO THERE WERE A LOT OF
MODELS WALKING AROUND NAKED.

00:14.515 --> 00:17.017
- THEY WERE HAVING SEX.
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?

00:17.118 --> 00:20.221
- I SAW THEM.
- WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER TELL
YOUR MOTHER WHAT YOU SAW?

00:20.321 --> 00:23.391
IT'S NOT MY JOB
TO MAKE HER FACE REALITY!

00:23.491 --> 00:27.161
I'M THE CHILD!
SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BE
SMARTER THAN ME.

00:27.261 --> 00:28.862
SOPHIE, IN ALL THE WEEKS
THAT WE'VE BEEN IN THERAPY,

00:28.962 --> 00:31.332
YOU'VE NEVER ONCE
ALLOWED YOURSELF TO BE
ANGRY AT YOUR FATHER.

00:31.432 --> 00:34.268
I THINK THAT YOUR FATHER
MADE YOU HIS ACCOMPLICE

00:34.368 --> 00:36.470
AND HE DROVE THIS WEDGE
BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR MOTHER.

00:36.570 --> 00:37.971
WHY CAN'T YOU LET YOURSELF
BE ANGRY AT HIM?

00:38.072 --> 00:40.441
WHY SHOULD I BE ANGRY AT HIM?

00:40.541 --> 00:42.710
SHE'S THE ONE WHO--

00:42.810 --> 00:44.245
- WHO PISSES ME OFF!
- WHY?

00:44.345 --> 00:46.714
BECAUSE SHE'S PATHETIC
AND ANNOYING AND--

00:46.814 --> 00:49.117
AND SHE'S ALWAYS AROUND.

00:54.622 --> 00:57.325
( birds twittering )

00:57.425 --> 01:00.994
- Olivia: WHAT'D I TELL YA?
- Sophie: IT'S NOT 4:00.

01:01.095 --> 01:02.830
IT'S FIVE MINUTES TO.

01:02.930 --> 01:04.365
YOU SAID WE'D BE ON TIME.

01:04.465 --> 01:05.999
WE'RE EARLY.

01:06.100 --> 01:08.502
( laughs )
MY APOLOGIES.

01:11.472 --> 01:13.107
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO WAIT FOR ME.

01:13.207 --> 01:15.409
OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

01:15.509 --> 01:18.112
I'LL TAKE A WALK.
I LIKE THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:20.381 --> 01:23.651
OKAY. WHATEVER.
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.325
YOUR HAIR LOOKS
LOVELY LIKE THIS.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.627
REALLY.

01:33.727 --> 01:37.030
IT LOOKS LOVELY DOWN TOO,
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING REALLY

01:37.131 --> 01:40.234
GREAT ABOUT IT
WHEN IT'S UP LIKE THIS.

01:52.246 --> 01:54.415
- MOM--
- I WAS GONNA SAY--

01:54.515 --> 01:56.450
NO, WHAT-- WHAT
WERE YOU GONNA SAY?

01:56.550 --> 01:58.652
IT WAS NOTHING.
WHAT WERE YOU GONNA SAY?

02:01.088 --> 02:03.123
WELL, I WAS
JUST THINKING THAT

02:03.224 --> 02:05.993
AFTER YOUR SESSION,
IF YOU WEREN'T BUSY,

02:06.093 --> 02:07.661
THAT MAYBE WE
COULD DO SOMETHING.

02:07.761 --> 02:10.364
I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE
THE SHOES THAT I BOUGHT YOU,

02:10.464 --> 02:12.833
BUT MAYBE WE COULD
GO GET A DIFFERENT PAIR.

02:12.933 --> 02:15.903
OR GO GET COFFEE.

02:21.775 --> 02:23.411
WHAT'S WRONG?

02:23.511 --> 02:25.246
I'M FINE.

02:27.047 --> 02:28.516
TELL ME WHAT YOU
WERE GONNA SAY BEFORE.

02:28.616 --> 02:31.885
I HAVE TO GO.
I'M GOING TO BE LATE.

02:37.425 --> 02:39.760
( theme music playing )

02:56.277 --> 02:57.811
( crying )

02:57.911 --> 02:59.813
( blowing )

03:17.130 --> 03:19.467
EVERYTHING IS GOING TO SHIT.

03:21.134 --> 03:24.338
I TRIED TALKING
TO MY MOM ALL WEEK.

03:24.438 --> 03:26.240
I JUST TRIED AGAIN
IN THE CAR

03:26.340 --> 03:28.409
AND I CAN'T SAY
ANYTHING TO HER.

03:30.411 --> 03:32.380
I LITERALLY CAN'T.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.148
I FEEL LIKE THERE'S
THIS LUMP IN MY THROAT

03:35.249 --> 03:37.685
ALL THE TIME NOW.

03:37.785 --> 03:40.488
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'D LIKE TO SAY TO HER?

03:41.755 --> 03:43.491
I DON'T EVEN KNOW.

03:44.492 --> 03:46.193
IT'S NOT JUST ONE THING.

03:46.294 --> 03:48.429
I JUST WANT
TO TALK TO HER LIKE--

03:58.205 --> 04:00.107
MY DAD'S BEEN CALLING

04:00.207 --> 04:02.976
CONSTANTLY
EVERY DAY THIS WEEK,

04:03.076 --> 04:04.545
LIKE HE'S SUDDENLY
COMPETING FOR

04:04.645 --> 04:07.548
MOST ATTENTIVE FATHER
OF THE YEAR AWARD.

04:07.648 --> 04:09.216
I HAVEN'T
CALLED HIM BACK ONCE.

04:09.317 --> 04:11.952
- WHY NOT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

04:16.223 --> 04:17.891
WHY DO YOU THINK
HE'S CALLING SO OFTEN?

04:17.991 --> 04:19.893
PAUL, STOP.

04:19.993 --> 04:21.261
I DON'T KNOW, OKAY?

04:21.362 --> 04:24.798
I CAN'T. JUST GIVE ME
A FUCKING BREAK.

04:28.902 --> 04:30.771
YESTERDAY ON BEAM...

04:32.272 --> 04:34.475
MY LEGS STARTED TO SHAKE--

04:36.444 --> 04:39.680
LIKE A SPASM OR SOMETHING.

04:39.780 --> 04:43.183
I'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN
TO SOME OF THE YOUNGER GIRLS
WHEN THEY GET SCARED.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.919
I'VE NEVER BEEN
SCARED ON THE BEAM.

04:46.019 --> 04:49.723
CY WAS WATCHING,
SO HE'LL PROBABLY PULL
ME OUT OF THE MEET.

04:49.823 --> 04:52.159
I PROBABLY WON'T
EVEN GET TO COMPETE.

04:52.259 --> 04:54.261
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

04:54.362 --> 04:56.864
WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT?

05:00.934 --> 05:04.505
EVEN IF I DO COMPETE,
HOW THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED
TO ACE A NATIONAL TRYOUT

05:04.605 --> 05:07.007
IF I'M SHAKING
LIKE AN EPILEPTIC?

05:08.742 --> 05:11.078
I'LL FALL APART ON THE BEAM
AND BECOME A JOKE.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.286
THERE'S SOMETHING
SERIOUSLY WRONG WITH ME.

05:19.387 --> 05:22.956
SO WE'RE GOING
BACK TO THIS THEN?

05:23.056 --> 05:26.394
THAT IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT,
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING
SERIOUSLY WRONG WITH YOU?

05:26.494 --> 05:27.895
( crying )
THERE IS.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.063
I'M ALL FUCKED UP.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.833
IN WHAT WAY IS THAT?

05:32.933 --> 05:35.002
GEE, I DON'T KNOW, PAUL.

05:35.102 --> 05:36.770
I RAN MY BIKE INTO A CAR.

05:36.870 --> 05:39.540
THEN AS SOON AS THEY
WANTED TO TAKE MY CAST OFF,

05:39.640 --> 05:42.376
MY NECK MYSTERIOUSLY
WIGGED OUT.

05:43.243 --> 05:44.945
THEN I TOOK YOUR PILLS.

05:45.045 --> 05:47.247
AND NOW I HAVE SOME
SORT OF A FLESH-EATING DISEASE.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.349
I MEAN, LOOK.

05:52.786 --> 05:55.689
DIDN'T YOUR DERMATOLOGIST
SAY THERE WASN'T ANYTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT?

05:55.789 --> 05:57.991
WHAT IN THE HELL
DOES SHE KNOW?

06:00.661 --> 06:03.631
SHE DIDN'T SAY THAT IT
MIGHT BE STRESS-RELATED?

06:05.032 --> 06:06.800
YOU KNOW THAT ANXIETY
CAN MANIFEST ITSELF

06:06.900 --> 06:09.036
IN ALL KINDS
OF PHYSICAL WAYS.

06:09.136 --> 06:12.840
SOME PEOPLE
CAN GET CRAMPS,

06:12.940 --> 06:15.576
MIGRAINES, A RASH.

06:17.478 --> 06:20.013
SO I'M JUST
A LITTLE WORRIED?

06:20.113 --> 06:21.749
OKAY, ALL BETTER.

06:21.849 --> 06:24.251
SOPHIE, YOU'RE TRYING TO DO
TWO BIG THINGS AT THE MOMENT.

06:24.351 --> 06:26.286
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE TALKING
TO YOUR MOTHER.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.489
YOU'RE NOT JUST BERATING HER
LIKE YOU USED TO DO.

06:28.589 --> 06:32.259
YOU'RE-- YOU'RE ACTUALLY
TRYING TO TALK TO HER.

06:32.359 --> 06:36.664
AND YOU ARE AVOIDING
YOUR FATHER.

06:36.764 --> 06:39.232
THESE ARE EXTREMELY
DIFFICULT THINGS TO DO

06:39.332 --> 06:42.302
BECAUSE YOU'VE NEVER
DONE THEM BEFORE.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.705
AND...

06:44.805 --> 06:47.675
THEY COULD LEAD
TO PAINFUL PLACES.

06:47.775 --> 06:50.978
LIKE TELLING YOUR MOTHER
YOUR FATHER'S SECRETS

06:51.078 --> 06:54.748
AND TELLING YOUR DAD
THAT YOU'RE ANGRY WITH HIM.

06:54.848 --> 06:57.718
DON'T YOU THINK THAT
COULD BE CAUSING YOU
A LOT OF ANXIETY?

06:58.852 --> 07:01.288
AND THAT YOUR BODY IS
SENDING UP THESE KIND OF

07:01.388 --> 07:04.157
FLARES IN THE FORM
OF A RASH?

07:05.593 --> 07:07.394
I'M ALMOST CERTAIN, SOPHIE,

07:07.495 --> 07:10.531
THAT THERE IS NOTHING
PHYSICALLY WRONG WITH YOU.

07:12.399 --> 07:15.603
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

07:15.703 --> 07:18.606
I REMEMBER ONCE
YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS
STARTING MY PRACTICE,

07:18.706 --> 07:22.342
I MOVED TO THE CITY
AND GOT A NEW APARTMENT.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.945
EVERYTHING WAS GOING
REALLY WELL.

07:25.045 --> 07:27.280
VERY HAPPY, I THOUGHT.

07:27.380 --> 07:30.417
AND THEN ONE DAY
I WAS WITH A PATIENT

07:30.518 --> 07:32.886
AND FOR NO REASON
MY HEART STARTED TO POUND.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.354
I COULDN'T BREATHE.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.956
I HAD THIS
RINGING IN MY EARS

07:36.056 --> 07:38.458
WHEN SUDDENLY MY TONGUE
STARTED TO SWELL UP.

07:38.559 --> 07:40.327
SO THIS PATIENT
CALLED THE AMBULANCE

07:40.427 --> 07:42.563
AND THEY-- THEY TOOK ME
TO THE HOSPITAL.

07:42.663 --> 07:45.933
TOOK ME TO THIS ROOM,
DID ALL THESE KINDS OF TESTS.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.671
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY
FOUND IN THE END?

07:52.372 --> 07:53.774
WHAT?

07:54.575 --> 07:56.677
NOTHING.

07:56.777 --> 08:00.247
I'D HAD WHAT THEY
CALL AN ANXIETY ATTACK.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.351
( chuckles )
GUESS I WAS MORE...

08:04.451 --> 08:06.787
OVERWHELMED AND STRESSED
THAN I THOUGHT I WAS.

08:07.588 --> 08:10.524
I THINK THAT'S BULLSHIT.

08:10.624 --> 08:13.493
DOES THIS LOOK LIKE A LITTLE
ANXIETY RASH TO YOU?

08:13.594 --> 08:16.129
( crying )
WELL, DOCTOR?

08:16.229 --> 08:17.565
HELLO?

08:17.665 --> 08:19.332
LOOK AT ME, YOU SHIT!

08:19.432 --> 08:22.936
AM I THAT MUCH OF A FREAK
THAT YOU CAN'T EVEN LOOK AT ME?

08:23.036 --> 08:26.239
WHAT'S THE MATTER, PAUL?
AM I EMBARRASSING YOU?

08:26.339 --> 08:28.375
CROSSING YOUR BOUNDARIES?

08:28.475 --> 08:32.079
YOU WANT TO DISAPPEAR
WHEN SOMEBODY ELSE WANTS
SOMETHING FROM YOU?

08:38.318 --> 08:40.287
DO I STILL SEEM
NORMAL TO YOU?

08:42.890 --> 08:44.725
MM-HMM.

08:50.397 --> 08:52.633
I SHOCKED YOU.

08:54.101 --> 08:55.769
YOU'RE SHOCKED.

09:00.173 --> 09:03.210
MY TITTIES SCARED YOU.

09:03.310 --> 09:06.580
HOW CAN THEY?
THEY'RE JUST THESE
TINY LITTLE THINGS.

09:09.282 --> 09:11.218
DOES THE SIZE
OF YOUR BREASTS

09:11.318 --> 09:13.253
UPSET YOU, SOPHIE?

09:13.353 --> 09:15.656
OF COURSE NOT.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.825
IT'S JUST WHAT
HAPPENS TO GYMNASTS.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.728
IT'S THE DIET.

09:20.828 --> 09:24.632
WHEN GIRLS STOP TRAINING
THEY EXPLODE.

09:24.732 --> 09:27.701
THEY GAIN WEIGHT,
GROW A GREAT BIG
RACK AND ASS,

09:27.801 --> 09:29.737
GET FULL PERIODS.

09:29.837 --> 09:32.239
THEY BECOME NORMAL.

09:32.339 --> 09:35.275
I KNOW IT'S NOT NORMAL
TO BE LIKE THIS, I GET THAT.

09:36.777 --> 09:39.079
I'D SAY THAT YOU
HAD THE BODY OF A--

09:39.179 --> 09:40.981
A FUCKING FREAK.

09:43.751 --> 09:46.954
I HAVE THE BODY
OF A CHILD.

09:47.054 --> 09:50.257
BUT I'M NOT A CHILD.
CHILDREN DON'T WANT
TO KILL THEMSELVES.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.996
THAT'S TRUE.

10:03.236 --> 10:06.306
ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT DEATH
AGAIN, SOPHIE?

10:11.578 --> 10:13.313
DO YOU KNOW WHY?

10:13.413 --> 10:17.017
BECAUSE EVERYTHING
IS FALLING APART AROUND ME.

10:17.117 --> 10:20.353
IT'S WHAT I'M TRYING
TO TELL YOU.

10:20.453 --> 10:23.423
IT'S LIKE THAT DREAM
I USED TO HAVE

10:23.523 --> 10:25.225
WHERE THE PRETTY MEADOW
TURNS TO ASH

10:25.325 --> 10:27.127
RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY EYES.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.162
EXCEPT I'M AWAKE

10:29.262 --> 10:30.998
AND I CAN'T MAKE IT STOP.

10:40.073 --> 10:42.342
YOU KNOW, I WAS REMEMBERING
SOMETHING THAT YOU TOLD ME.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.847
THE TIME WHEN YOU
WERE IN THE AMBULANCE.

10:46.947 --> 10:50.050
YOU REMEMBER?
YOU WANTED TO PUT
THE MIRROR OUTSIDE

10:50.150 --> 10:52.119
SO THAT YOU COULD SEE
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

10:52.219 --> 10:54.988
YOU COULDN'T SEE
ANYTHING EXCEPT YOURSELF.

10:55.088 --> 10:57.190
- DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?
- SO WHAT?

10:57.290 --> 10:59.893
WELL, I THINK SOMETIMES
WHEN THINGS GO WRONG

10:59.993 --> 11:02.896
IN YOUR LIFE, SOPHIE,
YOU BLAME YOURSELF.

11:04.231 --> 11:06.299
WHENEVER A SITUATION
SEEMS DIFFICULT,

11:06.399 --> 11:10.337
YOU ASSUME THAT IT'S--
THAT IT'S YOUR FAULT.

11:10.437 --> 11:13.240
YOU BUILT THIS SURROGATE HOME
WITH CY AND DARLENE

11:13.340 --> 11:14.775
AND IT FELL APART FOR YOU.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.977
AND YOU BLAMED YOURSELF,

11:17.077 --> 11:18.879
NOT CY.

11:18.979 --> 11:20.647
AND YOU DECIDED
TO PUNISH YOURSELF

11:20.748 --> 11:23.450
BY RIDING YOUR
BICYCLE INTO A CAR.

11:23.550 --> 11:26.920
SEE, THE THING IS,
IF YOU SEE YOURSELF
ALWAYS AS THE PROBLEM,

11:27.020 --> 11:29.790
YOU'RE GOING
TO CREATE DISCORD

11:29.890 --> 11:33.626
IN-- IN THE MOST
PERFECT PLACES.

11:33.727 --> 11:35.195
DID IT EVER
OCCUR TO YOU

11:35.295 --> 11:38.365
THAT CY WAS THE PERSON
RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAPPENED?

11:38.465 --> 11:41.401
- IT WAS MY FAULT.
- BUT WHY DOES IT
HAVE TO BE YOUR FAULT?

11:41.501 --> 11:44.805
BECAUSE IT IS.
THAT'S THE SECOND
TIME IT'S HAPPENED.

11:44.905 --> 11:47.274
YOU MEAN IT'S
THE SECOND TIME
YOUR HOME FELL APART.

11:47.374 --> 11:50.143
BUT WHY WOULD YOU THINK
THAT THAT WAS YOUR FAULT?

11:52.045 --> 11:53.881
- I DON'T KNOW. IT JUST WAS.
- NO, I NEED YOU TO TELL ME.

11:53.981 --> 11:56.016
- I DON'T KNOW.
- NO, IT'S IMPORTANT
FOR YOU--

11:56.116 --> 11:58.185
- I DON'T KNOW, PAUL.
- NO, BUT--

11:58.285 --> 12:00.220
STOP IT!

12:00.320 --> 12:04.057
YOU WANT ME TO HAVE
SOME BIG BREAKTHROUGH TODAY,
I CAN SEE THAT.

12:08.962 --> 12:11.431
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
TELL ME WHAT THE ANSWER IS

12:11.531 --> 12:12.966
AND I'LL REPEAT IT
BACK TO YOU

12:13.066 --> 12:15.335
AND YOU CAN PUT A GOLD STAR
ON MY FOREHEAD?

12:15.435 --> 12:17.737
WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IS
HELP YOU FIND YOUR OWN ANSWERS.

12:17.838 --> 12:19.773
AND I THINK THAT YOU ARE

12:19.873 --> 12:22.342
REALLY CLOSE TO THAT.

12:23.610 --> 12:26.079
AND I UNDERSTAND
HOW SCARY THAT MUST BE.

12:37.991 --> 12:39.860
HAVE YOU EVER READ THE BIBLE?

12:41.494 --> 12:44.865
ISN'T THAT LIKE ILLEGAL
FOR YOU TO ASK ME THAT?

12:44.965 --> 12:48.168
( laughs )
NOT REALLY.

12:48.268 --> 12:51.972
IT'S REALLY JUST
A SUBJECT LIKE ANY OTHER.

12:52.072 --> 12:55.809
YOU CAN CHOOSE
TO TALK ABOUT IT OR NOT.

12:55.909 --> 12:57.144
ANYWAY,
IN THE NEW TESTAMENT

12:57.244 --> 12:59.279
GOD IS ALWAYS
PORTRAYED AS BEING GOOD

12:59.379 --> 13:01.581
AND WICKEDNESS
AND EVIL IS A HUMAN THING,

13:01.681 --> 13:03.083
A HUMAN PROBLEM.

13:03.183 --> 13:04.784
ACTUALLY, IT'S ONE
OF THE THINGS

13:04.885 --> 13:07.787
THAT'S HELPED CHRISTIANITY
TO SPREAD VERY QUICKLY.

13:09.556 --> 13:12.192
CAN YOU--
CAN YOU THINK WHY?

13:14.527 --> 13:16.629
BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE TO FEEL
SHITTY ABOUT THEMSELVES?

13:16.729 --> 13:19.432
THAT'S IT. EXACTLY.

13:19.532 --> 13:22.302
WE PREFER TO LIVE
IN A WORLD WHERE GOD IS GOOD

13:22.402 --> 13:25.973
AND MAN IS BAD
RATHER THAN A WORLD
WHERE GOD IS BAD.

13:26.073 --> 13:28.341
SO AN EVIL AUTHORITY,
AN UNFAIR GOVERNMENT,

13:28.441 --> 13:31.478
NEGLECTFUL PARENTS--
THAT'S A PRETTY SCARY CONCEPT.

13:31.578 --> 13:33.680
MAKES YOUR WHOLE LIFE SEEM

13:33.780 --> 13:35.382
KIND OF SCARY
AND MEANINGLESS.

13:35.482 --> 13:39.252
IT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY
CHILDREN WILL BLAME THEMSELVES

13:39.352 --> 13:41.154
BEFORE THEIR PARENTS.

13:46.626 --> 13:48.929
YOU TOLD ME ONCE
THAT YOU WANTED TO MOVE
ACROSS THE COUNTRY

13:49.029 --> 13:51.298
TO BE WITH YOUR DAD
AND HIS NEW WIFE,
BUT THAT THEY--

13:51.398 --> 13:54.968
THEY DIDN'T HAVE
A ROOM FOR YOU
IN HER HOUSE.

13:55.068 --> 13:56.970
YOU SAID THAT
THEY ARGUED ABOUT IT

13:57.070 --> 13:59.072
AND THAT EVENTUALLY
HE LEFT HER, RIGHT?

13:59.172 --> 14:01.875
- RIGHT.
- HOW LONG DID IT TAKE HIM

14:01.975 --> 14:04.411
TO-- TO LEAVE HER?

14:06.713 --> 14:08.581
I DON'T KNOW,
OVER TWO YEARS.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.184
HMM.

14:11.284 --> 14:14.487
AND DURING THAT WHOLE TIME,
YOUR MOTHER WAS DEPRESSED

14:14.587 --> 14:16.423
AND CRYING CONSTANTLY, YEAH?

14:16.523 --> 14:19.359
AND YOU WANTED TO MOVE
TO YOUR DAD AND BE WITH HIM,

14:19.459 --> 14:20.693
BUT YOU COULDN'T.

14:20.793 --> 14:22.762
TWO YEARS IS A LONG TIME
FOR A CHILD

14:22.862 --> 14:25.899
TO BE WITHOUT
A SAFE PLACE TO CALL HOME.

14:25.999 --> 14:28.969
I TOLD YOU, HE LEFT HER
BECAUSE OF THAT.

14:29.069 --> 14:31.071
AFTER TWO YEARS, SOPHIE.

14:43.016 --> 14:44.884
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

14:48.121 --> 14:50.490
HOW COULD HE
JUST STOP LOVING ME?

14:50.590 --> 14:51.992
WHAT DID I DO?

14:52.092 --> 14:54.161
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.965
ISN'T THERE
A LAW SOMEWHERE

14:58.065 --> 15:00.867
THAT SAYS PARENTS HAVE
TO LOVE THEIR KIDS FOREVER?

15:00.968 --> 15:05.872
YOU'RE RIGHT, BUT YOU
MUST'VE SCREWED UP SOMEWHERE.

15:05.973 --> 15:07.574
OTHERWISE, HOW COULD THEY
TREAT YOU LIKE THIS?

15:07.674 --> 15:11.544
A FATHER CAN'T JUST ABANDON
HIS PERFECTLY NORMAL DAUGHTER,

15:11.644 --> 15:13.613
SWAP HER FOR A NEW FAMILY.

15:13.713 --> 15:17.517
A MOTHER CAN'T
JUST FALL INTO A DEEP
DEPRESSION AND IGNORE HER.

15:18.818 --> 15:20.420
MUST BE YOUR FAULT.

15:28.728 --> 15:30.897
MAYBE IF I HAD TOLD
MY MOTHER ABOUT THE CHEATING

15:30.998 --> 15:33.066
THEN AT LEAST THINGS
WOULD BE BETTER WITH HER.

15:33.166 --> 15:35.102
SOPHIE, THAT IS NOT
THE SORT OF RESPONSIBILITY

15:35.202 --> 15:37.037
A CHILD SHOULD
BE ASKED TO HANDLE.

15:37.137 --> 15:38.738
YOUR FATHER CHEATED
ON YOUR MOTHER,

15:38.838 --> 15:40.974
YOU DIDN'T TELL HER,
THEN HE LEFT.

15:41.074 --> 15:44.077
YOU NEEDED THAT
ORDER OF EVENTS
TO SOMEHOW MAKE SENSE

15:44.177 --> 15:46.079
SO YOU BLAMED YOURSELF

15:46.179 --> 15:48.948
BECAUSE NOTHING ELSE
MADE SENSE.

15:52.552 --> 15:54.121
( sniffs )

15:58.591 --> 16:00.327
SOPHIE...

16:02.662 --> 16:05.565
LISTEN TO ME.

16:05.665 --> 16:09.202
YOU SAW YOUR DAD CHEATING
AND YOU DIDN'T TELL YOUR MOM.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.104
NOW DO YOU HONESTLY THINK

16:11.204 --> 16:13.540
THAT THAT'S A REASON
FOR YOU TO BE ABANDONED?

16:31.558 --> 16:34.061
I FOUND MY DIARY
FROM FOURTH GRADE.

16:35.695 --> 16:38.098
I USED TO WRITE
IN THIS THING CONSTANTLY.

16:39.232 --> 16:40.867
DID YOU EVER KEEP A DIARY?

16:40.967 --> 16:42.602
NO.

16:46.206 --> 16:47.674
I TOOK IT OUT
BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE

16:47.774 --> 16:49.442
IF YOU WERE RIGHT

16:49.542 --> 16:52.379
ABOUT HOW HARD IT WAS
FOR ME TO LIE TO MY MOTHER.

16:56.049 --> 16:58.051
DO YOU WANT ME
TO READ YOU WHAT I FOUND?

16:59.719 --> 17:01.521
I'D BE HONORED.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.674
"DEAR HERMIONE"--
I PRETENDED THAT I WAS

17:21.774 --> 17:23.543
WRITING TO HERMIONE GRANGER.

17:23.643 --> 17:27.114
- WHO'S THAT?
- YOU KNOW, FROM
"HARRY POTTER."

17:27.947 --> 17:29.649
TELL ME YOU'VE READ THOSE.

17:30.517 --> 17:31.984
ARE YOU INSANE?

17:32.085 --> 17:35.288
I JUST HAVEN'T
GOTTEN AROUND TO IT YET.

17:35.388 --> 17:38.225
- THEY'VE BEEN OUT
FOR 10 YEARS.
- I KNOW I KNOW I KNOW.

17:38.325 --> 17:39.859
I'LL BRING YOU MY SET
NEXT WEEK, OKAY?

17:39.959 --> 17:41.828
NO, THAT'S NOT
NECESSARY, HONESTLY.

17:41.928 --> 17:44.131
MY KIDS HAVE THEM.

17:44.231 --> 17:45.765
- THEY'VE READ THEM?
- UH-HUH.

17:45.865 --> 17:47.934
AND-- AND THEY
REALLY LOVE THEM.

17:48.034 --> 17:49.869
OKAY.

17:49.969 --> 17:51.604
MAYBE YOU'RE NOT
SUCH A FUCKED-UP PARENT.

17:51.704 --> 17:54.307
( chuckles )
THANK YOU.

17:55.642 --> 17:57.210
"DEAR HERMIONE,

17:57.310 --> 17:59.112
IT WAS A TERRIBLE DAY TODAY.

17:59.212 --> 18:01.314
I AM SO SAD.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.283
I'M SORRY I HAVEN'T
WRITTEN TO YOU IN A WHILE.

18:03.383 --> 18:05.952
I KNOW YOU MUST
BE ANGRY AND MISS ME.

18:06.052 --> 18:08.221
I MISS YOU TOO.

18:08.321 --> 18:09.956
I WANTED TO TELL YOU
EVERYTHING,

18:10.056 --> 18:11.391
BUT I KNOW I MUST
HIDE THINGS FROM YOU

18:11.491 --> 18:13.860
BECAUSE SHE
MIGHT READ IT.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.262
I'M AFRAID FROM NOW ON

18:15.362 --> 18:17.497
YOU AND I MUST
SUSTAIN OURSELVES."

18:21.067 --> 18:23.002
WHAT IS IT?

18:23.102 --> 18:25.672
I WROTE "SUSTAINED"
INSTEAD OF "RESTRAINED."

18:29.142 --> 18:31.278
WHERE DID YOU
KEEP THIS DIARY?

18:31.378 --> 18:33.813
ON MY NIGHT TABLE.

18:33.913 --> 18:35.482
NOT HIDDEN AWAY?

18:40.520 --> 18:42.589
YOU KNOW,
IT'S A WONDERFUL GIFT,

18:42.689 --> 18:44.791
THIS DIARY.

18:44.891 --> 18:46.526
IT'S A REAL CLUE

18:46.626 --> 18:48.094
TO WHO YOU ARE.

18:48.195 --> 18:50.397
THERE YOU ARE
IN FOURTH GRADE,

18:50.497 --> 18:52.665
YOU'RE ALREADY PULLING
AWAY FROM YOUR WORLD.

18:52.765 --> 18:55.168
YOU'RE ESTABLISHING
A RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEBODY

18:55.268 --> 18:56.936
WHO CANNOT LET YOU DOWN--

18:57.036 --> 18:58.705
HERMIONE.

18:59.739 --> 19:02.242
YOU'RE CONFIDING IN HER.

19:02.342 --> 19:06.779
BUT YOU'RE STILL HOPING
THAT YOUR MOTHER WILL NOTICE.

19:08.781 --> 19:10.817
YOU THINK I WANTED HER
TO FIND THE DIARY?

19:10.917 --> 19:13.220
I THINK SO.

19:14.487 --> 19:18.925
AND YOU WANTED HER
TO ASK WHAT YOU'RE HIDING.

19:26.799 --> 19:28.167
YOU SAID THERE, UM,

19:28.268 --> 19:30.270
IT WAS A TERRIBLE DAY.
WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT?

19:30.370 --> 19:33.806
OH. IT WAS
SEPTEMBER 11th.

19:37.810 --> 19:39.546
WOW.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.751
( stammers )
GO ON. PLEASE.

19:46.286 --> 19:48.921
DO I HAVE TO READ IT?
IT'S SO FUCKING NAIVE.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.723
I'D LIKE TO HEAR IT.

19:57.630 --> 20:00.233
"TODAY, BAD MEN
FROM OTHER COUNTRIES

20:00.333 --> 20:02.201
HIJACKED AIRPLANES
AND FLEW THEM

20:02.302 --> 20:05.071
INTO IMPORTANT
AMERICAN BUILDINGS.

20:05.171 --> 20:06.739
THERE WERE PEOPLE INSIDE

20:06.839 --> 20:08.608
THE PLANES AND BUILDINGS.

20:09.942 --> 20:11.478
GOOD PEOPLE.

20:11.578 --> 20:14.447
DAD SAYS I'M GOING
TO INHERIT AN EVIL WORLD."

20:19.919 --> 20:21.988
I HATE HIM SO MUCH.

20:22.088 --> 20:23.823
I HATE HIM
SO MUCH.

20:23.923 --> 20:26.493
WHAT KIND OF A FUCKING IDIOT
TELLS A FOURTH-GRADER

20:26.593 --> 20:28.895
THAT SHE'S GOING
TO INHERIT AN EVIL WORLD?

20:28.995 --> 20:30.530
IF HE REALLY BELIEVED THAT,

20:30.630 --> 20:32.832
THEN WHY DIDN'T HE DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT

20:32.932 --> 20:35.935
INSTEAD OF RUNNING OFF
TO L.A. TO PHOTOGRAPH BIMBOS?

20:38.705 --> 20:40.239
HMM.

20:41.774 --> 20:45.545
- SO YOU'RE NOT
PICKING UP HIS CALLS?
- NO WAY.

20:45.645 --> 20:48.014
SO HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
THAT YOU'RE ANGRY AT HIM?

20:49.316 --> 20:51.050
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THIS NOW.

20:51.150 --> 20:52.852
OKAY.

20:52.952 --> 20:57.457
BUT WHEN YOU'RE READY,
WE'LL TALK ABOUT WHAT
YOU WANT TO SAY TO HIM.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.527
OKAY?

21:02.962 --> 21:04.497
OKAY.

21:08.167 --> 21:11.671
SO YOU REALLY THINK
THE RASH AND SPASMS
ARE COMING FROM MY HEAD?

21:11.771 --> 21:14.974
MM-HMM, BUT THAT DOESN'T
MEAN THEY'RE NOT REAL.

21:15.074 --> 21:18.678
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S--
THAT IT'S A DISEASE.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.916
SO WHAT DO I DO ABOUT IT?

21:24.016 --> 21:26.519
I THINK YOU NEED TO START
TO FORGIVE YOURSELF.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.821
FORGIVE MYSELF FOR WHAT?

21:28.921 --> 21:31.358
FOR NOT TELLING YOUR MOTHER
ABOUT YOUR FATHER'S AFFAIR.

21:31.458 --> 21:33.360
YOU KNOW, WHAT YOU
HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT

21:33.460 --> 21:36.062
THEY WERE GONNA
BREAK UP ANYWAY

21:36.162 --> 21:37.597
NO MATTER WHAT YOU DID.

21:37.697 --> 21:41.901
YOU ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE
FOR YOUR PARENTS' ACTIONS.

21:42.001 --> 21:46.005
THE ONLY ACTIONS THAT
WE CAN CONTROL ARE OUR OWN.

21:46.105 --> 21:50.943
AND THE ONLY POWER WE HAVE
IS HOW WE TREAT OTHER PEOPLE

21:51.043 --> 21:54.013
AND HOW WE TREAT OURSELVES.

21:54.113 --> 21:58.084
SO YOU WANT ME
TO FORGIVE MYSELF?

21:58.184 --> 22:00.620
MM-HMM.

22:03.089 --> 22:04.824
HOW?

22:04.924 --> 22:06.526
SLOWLY.

22:07.694 --> 22:09.929
IT'S GONNA TAKE A WHILE.

22:10.029 --> 22:11.698
IT'S TAKEN YOU A FEW YEARS
TO FALL INTO THIS

22:11.798 --> 22:14.867
AND IT'S PROBABLY
GONNA TAKE YOU A WHILE

22:14.967 --> 22:16.569
TO GET OUT OF IT.

22:18.405 --> 22:20.940
BUT YOU HAVE TO
START TRYING NOW.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.044
'CAUSE YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

22:26.446 --> 22:28.481
YOU DESERVE TO BE HAPPY.

22:48.334 --> 22:50.737
QUE LASTIMA.

22:50.837 --> 22:52.672
HMM?

22:52.772 --> 22:56.008
IT'S FROM A SPANISH SONG.
IT MEANS WHAT A SHAME.

22:56.108 --> 22:58.478
AH.
QUE-- QUE LASTIMA.

23:00.580 --> 23:04.751
( speaks Spanish )

23:06.218 --> 23:08.988
WOW.
MY SPANISH IS DREADFUL.

23:09.088 --> 23:10.523
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

23:10.623 --> 23:14.093
IT MEANS IN A CERTAIN LIGHT,
YOU LOOK LIKE A MOVIE STAR.

23:14.193 --> 23:15.995
OOH.

23:16.095 --> 23:18.197
WELL, GRACIAS.

23:18.297 --> 23:20.533
( both laugh )

23:27.006 --> 23:29.809
THE COMPETITION
IS ON FRIDAY.
SHOULD I GO?

23:29.909 --> 23:32.344
I THINK SO.

23:32.445 --> 23:34.681
I THINK THAT YOU
REALLY WANT TO AND...

23:34.781 --> 23:36.783
I AGREE THAT YOU SHOULD GO.

23:44.557 --> 23:46.626
- I HAVE TO GO.
- OKAY.

23:47.794 --> 23:50.396
MY MOM'S WAITING
FOR ME IN THE CAR.

23:50.497 --> 23:52.264
SHE WANTS
TO TAKE ME SHOPPING.

23:52.364 --> 23:55.502
OH, SHOPPING.
WOW, THAT SOUNDS ROUGH.

23:55.602 --> 23:58.170
( clears throat )
LISTEN, IF YOU DECIDE
TO COMPETE

23:58.270 --> 24:00.239
AND YOU START
TO FEEL ANXIOUS,

24:00.339 --> 24:01.708
I WANT YOU TO CALL ME, OKAY?

24:01.808 --> 24:04.343
YOU KNOW,
DON'T BE SHY.

24:04.443 --> 24:07.146
I'M NEVER SHY.

24:07.246 --> 24:09.616
SOMETIMES,
I'M CIRCUMSPECT

24:09.716 --> 24:11.217
OR WARY,
BUT NOT SHY.

24:11.317 --> 24:12.919
I STAND CORRECTED.

24:13.019 --> 24:14.621
AND LISTEN,
IF YOU'RE UP ON THE BEAM

24:14.721 --> 24:17.156
AND YOUR LEGS
START TO SHAKE,

24:17.256 --> 24:19.826
TRY SAYING
THIS TO YOURSELF:

24:19.926 --> 24:22.895
"I AM MAKING THIS HAPPEN.
IT IS COMING FROM INSIDE ME

24:22.995 --> 24:24.631
AND BECAUSE I AM
MAKING IT HAPPEN,

24:24.731 --> 24:28.000
I CAN MAKE IT STOP."

24:31.037 --> 24:32.071
DOES THAT REALLY WORK?

24:32.171 --> 24:34.607
MMM, I THINK IT CAN, YEAH.

24:34.707 --> 24:37.209
I USED IT ON MYSELF
A FEW YEARS AGO

24:37.309 --> 24:40.012
AND IT DID WORK.

24:41.313 --> 24:43.249
- OKAY, I'LL TRY IT.
- OKAY.

25:04.436 --> 25:07.006
( birds twittering )

25:21.988 --> 25:24.123
WHERE TO?

25:24.223 --> 25:26.759
WHEREVER YOU'D LIKE--
THE MALL, THE MOVIES...

25:28.027 --> 25:29.696
LET'S GO HOME.

25:31.230 --> 25:32.832
OKAY.

25:39.371 --> 25:42.041
WE CAN STOP FOR COFFEE
SOMEWHERE IF YOU WANTED TO.

25:47.013 --> 25:48.748
- WHAT'S WRONG?
- NOTHING.

25:48.848 --> 25:50.983
- ( laughs )
- WE DON'T HAVE TO.

25:51.083 --> 25:53.786
NO, WE SHOULD.
WE SHOULD DO THAT.

25:59.325 --> 26:01.093
( car starts )

26:16.609 --> 26:19.078
( theme music playing )
