WEBVTT

00:33.910 --> 00:35.443
Next.

00:35.577 --> 00:39.781
Hey I'm uh Evan Kleinman reading
for the role of Jose Perez.

00:42.251 --> 00:44.287
Oh...

00:44.419 --> 00:46.454
Cristina I, uh...

00:48.224 --> 00:51.961
I really like you and I've
been waiting to do this for

00:53.095 --> 00:55.898
some time...

01:00.435 --> 01:04.307
Well, the kiss?

01:04.439 --> 01:05.975
Go.

01:06.775 --> 01:09.178
Just kiss her, come on.

01:12.248 --> 01:13.215
Um...

01:13.349 --> 01:14.783
Go

01:14.917 --> 01:18.187
Kiss her, come on.

01:20.256 --> 01:21.790
Okay uh, thank you.

01:21.924 --> 01:23.625
Can I just go
out and come back in?

01:23.758 --> 01:25.560
No.
That's not gonna work. Nah I'm sorry,

01:25.694 --> 01:28.998
We're not gonna call you, it's
not gonna happen. I'm sorry.

01:29.131 --> 01:31.133
Yeah, that wasn't good.

01:54.957 --> 01:57.559
You made out
with someone who had herpes?

01:57.692 --> 02:02.164
Hahahaha! You loser!

02:02.999 --> 02:04.733
Has this happened to you?

02:04.866 --> 02:06.701
Actually sir can
you just drop me off right here

02:06.835 --> 02:09.637
on this corner. Yeah, thank you.

02:09.771 --> 02:13.175
Yeah you know what
sir I'm actually gonna get out too.

02:16.979 --> 02:18.580
What kind of car do you drive?

02:18.713 --> 02:20.883
This is not
suitable for Gluber pool.

02:21.017 --> 02:23.219
It says here your
drop off is in the valley.

02:24.786 --> 02:27.856
I'm just gonna
walk up Laurel Canyon drive.

02:27.990 --> 02:31.027
Just please
give me five stars. Please?

02:37.199 --> 02:38.000
Hey dad.

02:38.134 --> 02:39.435
What's up, son?

02:39.567 --> 02:41.070
Uh, I just
got out of an audition.

02:41.203 --> 02:43.406
Actually, yeah, I think
I'm gonna get a callback.

02:43.538 --> 02:45.474
What's the pay?

02:45.607 --> 02:46.876
Copy, credit, meal...

02:47.009 --> 02:48.511
Listen! It's not good enough.

02:48.643 --> 02:51.047
We've been through this a
million times! I'm an actor!

02:51.180 --> 02:54.283
Why don't you come back
home and work with your old man?

02:54.417 --> 02:56.684
Mom and I cannot
see you struggling like that.

02:56.818 --> 03:01.290
I love you. I gotta go.
Okay? Oh, one last thing!

03:02.557 --> 03:04.026
Can you wire me some money?

03:04.160 --> 03:06.661
I have a couple
bills I need to take care of.

03:06.795 --> 03:09.899
Listen and listen
good! This is the last time.

03:10.032 --> 03:12.034
Of course, of course Dad.

03:12.168 --> 03:15.237
Thank you so much. I love you.

03:17.506 --> 03:21.444
Hey guys! Evan here. I
just got out of an audition and

03:21.576 --> 03:26.315
it went amazing! I'll keep
you guys posted if I got it.

03:26.449 --> 03:28.783
Evan out!

04:16.499 --> 04:18.633
Oh, about time!

04:19.168 --> 04:22.171
Hello Evan.

04:25.608 --> 04:28.177
VR mode starting.

04:28.310 --> 04:29.145
My God...

04:31.646 --> 04:34.350
Oh Evan...

04:36.585 --> 04:38.653
I'm so horny.

04:43.325 --> 04:47.729
Before we start making
out, do you wanna dance?

04:48.330 --> 04:49.999
I'd love to.

05:16.425 --> 05:18.427
Let me make you happy.

05:18.561 --> 05:20.095
Yes.

05:46.188 --> 05:49.558
The country of
Allur was founded in 1894

05:49.692 --> 05:51.327
by two hot people.

05:51.460 --> 05:54.230
No one is certain of its
exact geographical location

05:54.363 --> 05:57.399
but many speculate
it is in the Middle East.

05:57.533 --> 06:01.203
The kingdom of Allur was
in such financial crisis that

06:01.337 --> 06:05.840
the royal guards had
to wear Halloween costumes.

06:06.375 --> 06:10.679
The kingdom of Allur.
A naturally beautiful country.

06:10.812 --> 06:13.549
From its scenic
views and flowing rivers

06:13.682 --> 06:15.484
to its gorgeous natives.

06:15.618 --> 06:18.887
Our land will transport
you to a world rich with romance

06:19.021 --> 06:23.025
and passion all
provided by Zuku Zuku.

06:23.559 --> 06:27.096
For decades Allur has been
the leader in the sacred art

06:27.229 --> 06:31.934
of love making. Not even the
Kama Sutra knows of such lust.

06:32.701 --> 06:37.772
Allur, the land of Zuku Zuku.
Travel packages now available.

06:39.241 --> 06:42.244
Cut!

06:45.147 --> 06:50.519
This is what we do?
This is shit! This is purely shit!

06:51.853 --> 06:56.258
Calm down!
Imagining a big lollypop!

06:56.392 --> 06:57.259
Lollypop?

06:57.393 --> 06:58.227
Lollypop!

06:58.360 --> 06:59.361
Did you guys like it?

06:59.495 --> 07:00.663
I loved it! it's great!

07:00.795 --> 07:03.666
Yes it is fantastic work!

07:03.798 --> 07:05.634
But we are going
with the other plan.

07:05.768 --> 07:08.270
You know the Zuku Zuku
doesn't work well anymore anyways.

07:08.404 --> 07:10.606
All these western hipsters
care about these days is

07:10.739 --> 07:12.741
quick bang bang sploosh!

07:14.943 --> 07:18.013
Your royal highness,
Prince Ahmed and Prince Ali!

07:18.147 --> 07:20.949
Mommy.

07:21.083 --> 07:23.052
Father.

07:24.753 --> 07:28.691
Khalid, Khalid!
You made sure my third son is

07:28.823 --> 07:30.159
occupied
during this meeting?

07:30.292 --> 07:33.362
Oh yes your majesty,
nothing to worry about.

07:41.303 --> 07:42.971
Darwin Coming!

07:43.105 --> 07:48.177
Darwin you are so
brave, why don't I just untie you

07:48.310 --> 07:50.179
and we go back to bed?

07:50.312 --> 07:54.316
If we ever get out of this,
that villain is going to pay!

07:54.450 --> 07:59.388
Oh Mister Darwin!
You are so handsome!

08:01.523 --> 08:03.192
Oh ok, tea time!

08:03.325 --> 08:06.328
Just come lay with me!

08:06.462 --> 08:09.531
Our time for today is
over. I have a family meeting.

08:09.665 --> 08:10.532
I gotta go!

08:10.666 --> 08:12.067
Where's the mirror?

08:12.201 --> 08:15.471
There are no mirrors
here. Let me tell you my story.

08:15.604 --> 08:20.075
Once upon a time I
was born, like I am now, I was

08:20.209 --> 08:22.544
incredibly handsome...

08:23.779 --> 08:26.749
It must never leave the palace

08:26.882 --> 08:31.420
What is this? This is dangerous.

08:31.553 --> 08:32.888
Is it a baby?

08:33.021 --> 08:37.760
In fact a witch decreed that if
I ever saw myself in the mirror

08:37.893 --> 08:39.428
I would turn ugly.

08:39.561 --> 08:41.230
We made this?

08:41.363 --> 08:43.365
That's why
there are no mirrors here.

08:43.499 --> 08:46.735
How unlucky it is that
you'll never be able to witness

08:46.869 --> 08:48.170
your own beauty?

08:48.303 --> 08:51.573
And what is more
important than being handsome?

08:51.707 --> 08:53.108
Nothing my prince.

08:53.242 --> 08:54.810
The prince must go now.

08:54.943 --> 08:56.979
It has been decided. We will
complete a two billion dollar

08:57.112 --> 08:59.281
deal with hip new
energy out in California.

08:59.415 --> 09:02.651
Prince Ali and Prince Ahmed will
leave tomorrow to seal the deal

09:02.785 --> 09:05.254
and deliver the
bags of money to Los Angeles.

09:05.387 --> 09:06.989
Why don't you wire the money?

09:07.122 --> 09:09.625
Because they want to charge
me a thirty dollar wiring fee!

09:09.758 --> 09:11.126
What a rip off!

09:11.260 --> 09:14.496
Sons, this is our last
resort to save the country.

09:14.630 --> 09:19.334
I trust you to take
care of this. Good day.

09:20.602 --> 09:22.805
The royal
Highnesses, Prince Fahad!

09:22.938 --> 09:25.607
What is this father? I'm
hearing about Los Angeles.

09:25.741 --> 09:27.877
I have been asking years
to send me to Hollywood.

09:28.010 --> 09:31.013
I'm sending your brothers
Ali and Ahmed to California

09:31.146 --> 09:33.081
to invest
in new forms of energy.

09:33.215 --> 09:35.885
Energy is our
business after all.

09:36.018 --> 09:38.353
I have been
wasting my talents here.

09:38.487 --> 09:40.823
Your only talent is
having sex and watching

09:40.956 --> 09:43.559
that stupid
Darwin action movie!

09:43.692 --> 09:44.626
Darwin action films!

09:44.760 --> 09:45.627
Silence!

09:45.761 --> 09:46.995
Please father.

09:47.129 --> 09:49.465
Enough! You're
forbidden to leave this palace.

09:49.598 --> 09:52.434
The world is full of mirrors
Fahad, and you know what

09:52.568 --> 09:54.169
happens when
you look into one.

09:54.303 --> 09:56.438
I know what's gonna
happen. I will become ugly

09:56.572 --> 09:58.307
and I will be sent
to live with the cows.

09:58.440 --> 10:02.311
Exactly, you have no self
control. You can't be trusted.

10:02.444 --> 10:04.480
This is for your own safety.

10:04.613 --> 10:06.916
We are simply trying
to protect you, Fahad.

10:07.049 --> 10:10.819
Protect me from what my
mom? I'm wasting my time here.

10:12.254 --> 10:15.524
Meeting adjourned!

10:17.159 --> 10:20.462
Khalid! Khalid!

10:22.197 --> 10:24.333
Yes, your majesty.

10:24.466 --> 10:26.335
I have an important job for you.

10:26.468 --> 10:28.036
Right hand man
kind of important?

10:28.170 --> 10:30.339
I need you to
keep Prince Fahad safe.

10:30.472 --> 10:33.208
Of course your majesty,
that has always been my job.

10:33.342 --> 10:36.345
You understand
he's always been different.

10:36.478 --> 10:39.949
It is true. The Prince marches
to the beat of his own drum.

10:40.082 --> 10:42.518
He's damned ugly!

10:42.651 --> 10:44.820
Oh yes, that.

10:44.954 --> 10:47.756
Don't let him ruin the
opportunity to save the country.

10:47.891 --> 10:49.291
I will not fail you my king.

10:49.424 --> 10:51.693
Of course you won't.
Otherwise you will be hung.

10:51.827 --> 10:53.562
Wait, I thought we
don't do that anymore!

10:53.695 --> 10:56.865
You're right. We
will cut off your testicles.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.767
Both of them?

10:58.935 --> 11:00.569
Both of them!

11:16.051 --> 11:18.620
Oh my god...

11:21.723 --> 11:25.093
Oh! What?

11:26.896 --> 11:28.932
What is that?

11:29.064 --> 11:30.732
Oh you found the new prototype.

11:30.866 --> 11:33.702
Yeah, I'm testing out
this new hydrocarbon silicone

11:33.835 --> 11:35.470
polymer composite.

11:35.604 --> 11:38.473
Wait, so it's a
head that gives head?

11:38.607 --> 11:39.841
That's the idea.

11:39.976 --> 11:41.443
Is this a sex toy?

11:41.577 --> 11:42.611
Mhm.

11:42.744 --> 11:44.746
Dude you can
make a full robot of her.

11:44.881 --> 11:48.083
I would so love that. I mean,
just imagine. You and me, we'll

11:48.216 --> 11:50.419
be able to get with the most
beautiful women in the world

11:50.552 --> 11:53.622
even if we look like
bridge trolls, which we don't

11:53.755 --> 11:54.756
by the way.

11:54.891 --> 11:56.825
And the sex will be real.

11:56.960 --> 11:58.928
It's sex and the future!

11:59.062 --> 12:03.699
So this is your plan? Your plan
to finally lose your virginity.

12:03.832 --> 12:06.435
Nice work
buddy. I'm proud of you.

12:06.568 --> 12:09.973
But it's
complicated. I'm low on funds.

12:10.105 --> 12:12.976
So how was last night with that
chick from your acting class?

12:13.108 --> 12:14.643
Am I good or am I good?

12:14.776 --> 12:18.447
Ah man, the file, it skipped
a little bit, but otherwise

12:18.580 --> 12:21.050
incredible.
Barry you're a genius.

12:21.183 --> 12:24.519
Just wait once I figure out this
sex-bot thing. All I need is

12:24.653 --> 12:27.155
one pathetic rich guy who's
willing to cough over some

12:27.289 --> 12:29.491
major mulah...

12:31.193 --> 12:32.761
Ah!

12:57.987 --> 12:58.955
You poisoned them?

12:59.088 --> 12:59.956
They are asleep.

13:00.089 --> 13:01.356
You took my Xanax.

13:01.490 --> 13:03.492
Khalid we must go, quickly.

13:03.625 --> 13:05.160
But I have to
speak to your father

13:05.293 --> 13:06.528
and brothers
before their flight.

13:06.662 --> 13:08.263
They are not going. We are.

13:08.397 --> 13:09.498
No we cannot!

13:09.631 --> 13:11.000
Khalid.

13:11.134 --> 13:13.502
The jet is ready for take off. I
am going, either you are going

13:13.635 --> 13:16.039
with me or you will be hung.

13:40.395 --> 13:42.831
Follow your partner.

13:43.865 --> 13:47.769
Watch them. Connect.

13:47.904 --> 13:51.941
Feel the flow.

13:52.274 --> 13:55.078
This is the best acting class.

13:55.210 --> 13:59.781
You should be honored
that I share my time with you.

14:01.450 --> 14:04.486
Stephanie and Evan focus!

14:05.554 --> 14:09.725
You haven't paid me
for this class or the last one.

14:09.858 --> 14:14.663
Yeah about that. My
dad's going to pay, tomorrow?

14:14.796 --> 14:15.764
Your father?

14:15.898 --> 14:18.433
Yeah, yeah,
yeah. Soon, very soon.

14:18.567 --> 14:21.403
Daddy's gonna pay it soon!

14:22.804 --> 14:26.241
Back when I was doing
a production of 11th Night...

14:26.374 --> 14:27.944
I wish I was a millionaire.

14:28.077 --> 14:29.979
Can you imagine
yourself as a millionaire?

14:30.113 --> 14:31.847
You'd be cocky and unbearable.

14:31.981 --> 14:34.816
Yeah I know I would
and I'd like to try it anyway.

14:34.951 --> 14:39.287
Switch partners.
Rachel you're with Evan.

14:39.421 --> 14:42.158
Stephanie you are with Aaron.

14:43.391 --> 14:48.663
And everyone on their feet.
Come on. Let's go. Breathing.

14:49.132 --> 14:51.867
Very important. Breathing.

14:54.402 --> 14:56.973
Harrumph!

14:57.106 --> 14:58.640
Evan?

15:01.010 --> 15:03.411
Evan? What is this?

15:03.545 --> 15:05.714
Did I ask you to do this?
What is this?

15:05.915 --> 15:10.019
This is not part of the
breathing exercise. Ready?

15:10.153 --> 15:11.954
Ready, yeah.

15:18.060 --> 15:19.828
Where did you
pick up that bad habit?

15:19.962 --> 15:21.030
Um..

15:21.164 --> 15:22.631
Yo, that teacher's a dick.

15:22.764 --> 15:24.666
Yeah he made you cry dude.

15:24.800 --> 15:29.638
I'm over it. Yo Throw
rooftop tonight? All the celebrities are

15:29.771 --> 15:32.641
gonna be there.
Rachel's gonna come with us.

15:32.774 --> 15:33.675
Sweet.

15:33.809 --> 15:35.377
Oh yeah, I've been there.

15:35.510 --> 15:37.712
Is there
something going on tonight?

15:37.846 --> 15:40.950
Depends,
how many followers do you have?

15:41.483 --> 15:45.453
Um.. like 20...

15:47.789 --> 15:49.357
20,000 isn't enough.

15:49.491 --> 15:50.859
Bro, you need 100,000.

15:50.993 --> 15:52.561
Oh.

15:52.694 --> 15:55.664
I got 110. She's got
300. She's blowing up.

15:55.797 --> 15:58.633
Yeah, Let's ditch this loser.

16:10.545 --> 16:12.681
She's cute.

16:13.015 --> 16:14.783
That's my mom.

16:14.917 --> 16:17.752
At least you
know your followers are real.

16:18.221 --> 16:20.388
Ten of them are bots, actually.

16:22.925 --> 16:26.028
I better go, bro. See ya...

16:40.243 --> 16:43.712
Who
the hell are these guys?

16:45.114 --> 16:48.017
Woo! Lets go lets go!
Fast Fast.

16:48.150 --> 16:51.753
We don't have
time. Yeah this one.

16:53.022 --> 16:57.759
Okay! Okay!
I'm going. Okay!

17:01.796 --> 17:06.701
Let's go! We are here!
Woohoo! Go fast!

17:09.238 --> 17:10.472
What brings you to LA?

17:10.605 --> 17:12.741
We are here to
begin my acting career.

17:12.874 --> 17:16.145
No way, that's interesting.
Actually...

17:16.279 --> 17:17.914
I do a little acting myself.

17:18.047 --> 17:23.019
That's interesting. Do you
know Darwin? The action star.

17:23.152 --> 17:26.755
Um, no, no.
Can't say that I do.

17:26.889 --> 17:28.024
Haven't had the pleasure yet.

17:28.157 --> 17:29.058
Fahad!

17:29.191 --> 17:30.558
Khalid! We are in America!

17:30.692 --> 17:33.963
Do not call me
Fahad. Call me Darwin.

17:34.429 --> 17:36.299
So mister actor driver.

17:36.431 --> 17:37.732
It's Evan.

17:37.866 --> 17:42.038
Yes Evan, you
are an actor and an Uber driver?

17:42.171 --> 17:43.872
Yeah, yeah that's right.

17:44.006 --> 17:46.042
Have you been in
anything we might have seen?

17:46.175 --> 17:47.842
No. No.

17:47.977 --> 17:51.981
I'm still trying
to get thing on track.

17:52.315 --> 17:55.784
But I do take classes down at
Tantrum Acting Studios though.

17:55.918 --> 17:58.453
Thats amazing.
Khalid write this down.

17:58.586 --> 18:00.455
Write it down. We're
gonna go to this class.

18:00.588 --> 18:01.456
Fahad.

18:01.589 --> 18:02.959
Darwin. Darwin. Darwin.

18:03.092 --> 18:06.128
Darwin, we must prioritize,
first securing the

18:06.262 --> 18:08.931
investment before we
enroll you in any classes.

18:09.065 --> 18:12.667
What's this investment
you guys are talking about?

18:12.801 --> 18:17.539
Tech. So what
is hot out here in LA?

18:17.672 --> 18:20.443
The women.
That's the hottest thing.

18:20.575 --> 18:23.112
Oh and vegan cheese.

18:23.245 --> 18:25.414
What? That's disgusting.

18:25.547 --> 18:27.350
Ew.

18:34.190 --> 18:38.094
Wow, wow
this is just the beginning!

18:41.297 --> 18:44.166
Thank you so much Mr. Actor Evan
Driver. Here you go.

18:44.300 --> 18:48.371
Thank you. Oh I'm
so sorry if I offended you.

18:48.503 --> 18:50.906
Please take this as well!

18:53.042 --> 18:53.909
Thank you.

18:54.043 --> 18:54.910
Thank you.

18:55.044 --> 18:57.046
Thank you.

18:58.314 --> 19:00.049
Fahad!

19:13.062 --> 19:15.297
Woohoo!

19:15.431 --> 19:17.066
Wow!

19:17.199 --> 19:20.069
Darwin!! Woohoo!!!

19:20.202 --> 19:24.073
Yeah. Yeah. Freeze!

19:24.206 --> 19:26.708
It is I Darwin!

19:37.186 --> 19:42.391
Okay, alright. Alright. Yes.

19:42.624 --> 19:47.163
Oh it feels so good.

19:52.334 --> 19:56.539
Where did it go? It's
gone, they'll chop my head off!

19:56.671 --> 19:58.207
Fahad!

19:58.340 --> 20:03.112
Fahad! Where are you? Fahad!
There was another bag like this,

20:03.245 --> 20:04.113
did you see it?

20:04.246 --> 20:05.448
What?

20:05.580 --> 20:07.782
There was another
bag like this, did you see it?

20:07.917 --> 20:10.286
I only remember bringing one.

20:17.493 --> 20:19.161
Fahad, where is that bag?

20:19.295 --> 20:21.130
Fahad that bag
had a lot of money in it.

20:21.263 --> 20:23.566
The money your brothers were
going to use to secure that deal

20:23.698 --> 20:26.235
they had in place. The deal
that would have saved our

20:26.368 --> 20:28.471
country and
bought us time out here!

20:30.638 --> 20:33.741
What's going on there?
Why am I looking at the sky?

20:33.876 --> 20:35.643
Your majesty, it's
so good to see you again.

20:35.777 --> 20:38.514
You promised me quick returns
on my energy investment deal.

20:38.646 --> 20:41.350
Why is hip new energy
calling me about the money?

20:41.484 --> 20:44.553
Uh, your majesty it's very early
morning out here and people in

20:44.686 --> 20:46.188
LA go hiking.

20:46.322 --> 20:50.459
All you had to do was hand them
the money and sign the papers!

20:53.661 --> 20:55.898
You hung up on the king?

20:56.865 --> 21:00.102
You hung up on the King?

21:00.236 --> 21:02.972
You hung up on-
You Hung up on the King!

21:03.105 --> 21:05.608
Relax Khalid. Everything will
be fine. We're going to do the

21:05.740 --> 21:09.844
investment and I will be a movie
star. Someone will find the

21:09.979 --> 21:12.647
money and bring it
back. I am sure about that.

21:26.529 --> 21:31.534
A suitcase,
let's see if there's some dirty panties.

21:35.337 --> 21:37.339
The actor driver!

22:05.833 --> 22:06.801
This is it?

22:06.936 --> 22:09.905
Yes this is the acting school.

22:13.375 --> 22:17.213
Your headshot needs to say
everything about you in one

22:17.346 --> 22:22.750
quick glance. It needs to say
you're young but old at the same

22:24.019 --> 22:27.755
time. You're elegant,
yet you're mean.

22:27.890 --> 22:31.060
You're mean, yet educated.

22:31.193 --> 22:34.096
Sneaky, but educated.

22:34.230 --> 22:37.132
But mentally ill!
Very important!

22:37.266 --> 22:41.070
Wait outside, wait outside!

22:44.506 --> 22:46.642
Excuse me.

22:46.976 --> 22:48.711
My client
wants to take your class but he

22:48.843 --> 22:50.246
does not like mirrors.

22:50.379 --> 22:54.383
Listen pal this is the
world's greatest acting class

22:54.516 --> 22:57.953
taught by the world's
greatest acting teacher.

22:58.087 --> 23:01.023
You think you can just waltz...

23:04.426 --> 23:05.294
Carry on!

23:05.427 --> 23:06.462
You wait right here.

23:06.595 --> 23:11.000
Headshots. Evan, your headshot?

23:13.702 --> 23:16.705
Mr. Evan actor driver sir did we
happen to leave a bag of money

23:16.838 --> 23:18.007
in your car?

23:18.140 --> 23:21.644
Uh I
don't think so, no. I'm sorry.

23:21.910 --> 23:23.879
Who is your agent?

23:24.013 --> 23:27.116
Oh, you mean
FBI agent? I don't think so.

23:27.249 --> 23:28.484
How'd you find him?

23:28.617 --> 23:30.119
Oh, my father hired him.

23:30.252 --> 23:31.253
Who's your friend?

23:31.387 --> 23:33.455
Oh I'll
introduce you, come on.

23:34.590 --> 23:35.724
Hey! I'm Steph.

23:35.857 --> 23:36.925
Hi, nice to meet you.

23:37.059 --> 23:38.460
Nice to meet you too.

23:38.594 --> 23:41.930
Wow. Wow. Woo.

23:42.064 --> 23:45.833
Hi, my name
is Darwin. You can call me

23:45.968 --> 23:49.738
D-R-O-O-N-S-N-Y-O

23:49.871 --> 23:52.141
Okay, Hi Darwin.

23:52.274 --> 23:55.144
Okay party people
back to the headshots!

23:55.277 --> 23:56.745
Come Fahad we must go!

23:56.879 --> 23:58.681
Darwin! Call me Darwin!

23:58.813 --> 24:00.149
Darwin we
must go find the money!

24:00.282 --> 24:01.684
I'm not going
anywhere, you can go.

24:01.816 --> 24:05.454
You did pay for it. I'm
gonna take this class. Just go.

24:06.722 --> 24:08.590
Did you bring a headshot?

24:08.724 --> 24:09.892
What does that mean?

24:10.025 --> 24:11.694
A headshot.
A picture of yourself

24:11.826 --> 24:13.462
Oh, no.

24:26.308 --> 24:29.378
So remember keep
working on your scenes privately

24:29.511 --> 24:34.216
with your partners an as a
special bonus I have a casting

24:34.350 --> 24:36.585
director from a major major

24:36.719 --> 24:39.388
major studio coming to
see your final presentations.

24:42.291 --> 24:46.195
And one last
thing. My new all organic vegan

24:46.328 --> 24:48.797
gluten free diet has become
very expensive, so effective

24:48.931 --> 24:54.169
immediately the prices for
these classes has gone up 60%.

24:55.003 --> 24:58.774
Beat it! Get out of here.

24:58.907 --> 25:03.545
And Evan this might be
a good time to call daddy.

25:05.347 --> 25:09.218
And Fahad great
work! I'm very impressed!

25:09.351 --> 25:10.819
Is Khalid coming back?

25:10.953 --> 25:11.820
I don't think so.

25:11.954 --> 25:13.622
Okay.

25:14.556 --> 25:17.426
I've learned so
much already today and scene!

25:17.559 --> 25:19.495
Woohoo! I love it!

25:19.628 --> 25:22.231
Well Tommy is the
greatest actor of all time

25:22.364 --> 25:23.899
as he constantly reminds us.

25:24.032 --> 25:25.701
We're doomed!

25:25.834 --> 25:28.570
Oh, wow, this guys looks
like he needs a drink.

25:28.704 --> 25:29.705
Yeah

25:29.838 --> 25:30.939
I agree with you.

25:31.073 --> 25:32.107
You guys
wanna go to my place?

25:32.241 --> 25:33.709
Yeah let's go.

25:33.842 --> 25:35.411
Cool. Follow me.

25:50.592 --> 25:52.795
Barry! We have company!

25:52.928 --> 25:54.663
Come on in.

25:57.800 --> 25:59.935
Oh.
Hello hello!

26:00.068 --> 26:01.637
Ugh, Barry.

26:01.770 --> 26:03.472
How are you?

26:05.207 --> 26:08.477
You look awfully
familiar. Have we met?

26:08.610 --> 26:09.778
Oh no no no.

26:09.913 --> 26:11.480
It's not who you
think it is. No it's not her.

26:11.613 --> 26:13.282
You're the
chick from the VR machine!

26:13.415 --> 26:16.285
No, no, that's not her!
Barry just let that one go.

26:16.418 --> 26:17.887
Just be quiet.
Rachel, Steph.

26:18.020 --> 26:19.955
Do you guys mind giving me
a few minutes you guys can

26:20.088 --> 26:21.290
wait in my room. Thank you!

26:21.423 --> 26:22.758
Evan,
I'm like 99.9 percent sure.

26:22.892 --> 26:24.493
It's not her. Let it go.

26:24.626 --> 26:28.864
Jeez Evan.

26:31.433 --> 26:36.171
Oh my God. You
think he likes himself?

26:37.639 --> 26:40.409
He's so pretty.

26:41.878 --> 26:43.545
What is this?

26:43.679 --> 26:47.049
It's like VR.
It's like a video game.

26:55.324 --> 26:56.658
Dude you got her to move.

26:56.792 --> 26:58.660
Yeah, she even talks.

26:59.394 --> 27:01.096
Are you the
head that gives head?

27:01.230 --> 27:03.866
I certainly am.
Would you like a blowjob now?

27:03.999 --> 27:06.668
Yeah, so I solved all the
complexities and just built her.

27:06.802 --> 27:07.669
What do you think?

27:07.803 --> 27:08.871
Spectacular.

27:09.004 --> 27:10.606
Would you like a blowjob now?

27:10.739 --> 27:15.377
Yes, I want one. It's been two
days without any romance. Wow!

27:15.777 --> 27:18.347
I think she's
my soulmate. I'm in love!

27:18.480 --> 27:19.681
Come on man. Don't be stupid.

27:19.815 --> 27:22.784
You can't
fall in love with a robot.

27:26.355 --> 27:30.425
Oh, Evan I'm
so glad you're here.

27:30.559 --> 27:32.494
Oh my God!

27:33.362 --> 27:35.430
I'm so horny.

27:35.564 --> 27:37.533
What?

27:39.034 --> 27:42.237
Oh my. Oh my. Oh my god.

27:42.371 --> 27:44.373
How much will you
need for full body prototypes?

27:44.506 --> 27:46.542
Oh, I'll take over from here.
No, I got this. I got this.

27:46.675 --> 27:50.579
Um as the spokesperson
for, uh, Evan Advanced

27:50.712 --> 27:54.383
Robotics Corporation. We'll need
a minimum investment of ten

27:54.516 --> 27:58.687
million dollars for a single
prototype and a retainer fee for

27:58.820 --> 28:00.088
further production.

28:00.222 --> 28:01.590
I have an idea.
I'm going to call the king.

28:01.723 --> 28:02.391
Deal!

28:02.524 --> 28:03.927
Beautiful. Thank you!

28:04.059 --> 28:05.060
What is this?

28:05.193 --> 28:06.395
No, Rachel, take that off!

28:06.528 --> 28:09.631
Hey turn it off,
turn it off! Is it off?

28:11.266 --> 28:14.003
It's for acting class
I'm a method actor.

28:14.136 --> 28:15.671
What?

28:15.804 --> 28:18.840
It's not real. Just go back to
my room. Back to my room.

28:18.975 --> 28:21.076
I knew it was her!

28:23.046 --> 28:24.981
Can you believe they
made me park my boat on the

28:25.113 --> 28:29.886
other side of the port? I had to
walk 30 meters to my golf cart.

28:30.652 --> 28:33.188
Tell me about it,
my son just spent a fortune on

28:33.322 --> 28:37.693
sex robots. Can
you believe that? Sex robots.

28:37.826 --> 28:39.161
Sex robots?

28:39.294 --> 28:40.862
I am truly embarrassed.

28:40.997 --> 28:43.967
I have been very interested in
artificial intelligence for some

28:44.099 --> 28:47.803
time now. The implications.

28:48.972 --> 28:51.373
They are sending me a prototype.

28:53.809 --> 28:58.580
Can you tell
your son to send two. Twenty!

29:05.654 --> 29:07.556
Khalid had found a way to save

29:07.689 --> 29:10.893
his ass from
losing that briefcase.

29:12.794 --> 29:16.798
Well, well wow. Wow!

29:16.933 --> 29:19.334
Barry! Barry!

29:19.468 --> 29:20.802
What are you working on buddy?

29:20.937 --> 29:25.340
Just this new
prototype. Hi everyone.

29:25.807 --> 29:27.342
This place is...

29:27.476 --> 29:29.012
Where stars are born!

29:37.819 --> 29:39.855
Everything's okay!

29:39.989 --> 29:42.491
This is very
unprofessional in my opinion.

29:42.624 --> 29:46.662
Don't use the jacket. We
paid good money for that!

29:46.963 --> 29:49.197
Khalid, should we run?

29:49.331 --> 29:50.699
You run. I stay.

29:50.832 --> 29:54.202
I'm running.

30:48.657 --> 30:52.260
Welcome to Evanbots! This is the
assembly room where every part

30:52.394 --> 30:54.197
is hand assembled.

30:54.362 --> 30:57.833
First here at our nail painting
station is my buddy Barry.

30:57.967 --> 31:01.703
After assembly
every part then moves on to

31:01.837 --> 31:05.975
rigorous testing for movement.
This here is my buddy Dale,

31:06.109 --> 31:10.079
our handshake specialist
manning the hand job.

31:10.213 --> 31:13.116
Thank you sir. Up next

31:13.248 --> 31:16.518
we go to our breast augmentation
station. We have over 1500

31:16.651 --> 31:21.157
different types of boobs for
your choosing. How are you sir?

31:21.289 --> 31:22.925
You're doing great pal.

31:23.059 --> 31:25.460
Now I'd like for you to follow
me to quality control.

31:25.594 --> 31:26.528
Come this way.

31:26.661 --> 31:28.797
This is a private testing area.

31:28.931 --> 31:32.467
I've got 10
more of these to test today!

31:32.601 --> 31:35.370
You get the
idea. Quality control.

31:35.504 --> 31:39.775
At Evanbots, we love
you and our robots do too.

31:39.909 --> 31:43.146
Here at Evanbots
even you can get laid.

31:43.278 --> 31:46.615
At Evanbots
satisfaction guaranteed.

31:46.748 --> 31:49.085
The customer comes first.

31:49.218 --> 31:54.157
Women aren't robots.
They're not sex toys.

31:54.289 --> 31:56.491
They're
thinking, feeling people.

31:56.625 --> 31:58.827
Don't you see the
damage this does to people?

31:58.961 --> 32:00.062
They are just dolls.

32:00.196 --> 32:02.497
With perfect
bodies, willing to do anything

32:02.631 --> 32:05.201
they're
programmed by a man to do.

32:05.333 --> 32:07.402
I see
what you're saying.

32:07.970 --> 32:09.105
Do you?

32:09.238 --> 32:12.909
Barry how smart
is the artificial intelligence

32:13.042 --> 32:14.643
of these robot women.

32:14.776 --> 32:17.280
Pretty smart, I
programmed them so they learn at

32:17.412 --> 32:21.650
a high level. The idea is they
evolve and the sexual experience

32:21.783 --> 32:23.652
are new and
more satisfying every time.

32:23.785 --> 32:27.422
Wow, that's amazing! High five.

32:27.656 --> 32:30.592
Alright see you. Wow.

32:32.228 --> 32:33.095
Sex sound.

32:36.865 --> 32:39.868
Fahad waited like
a creep until everyone left

32:40.002 --> 32:41.336
the factory that night.

32:41.469 --> 32:46.541
Well, well, well.
Woo! Wow. I love that.

32:46.675 --> 32:48.911
WOO! Hoo, Hoo. Bark, Bark!

32:49.045 --> 32:51.546
Time to put the final
ingredient together.

32:51.680 --> 32:53.548
Ladies and gentlemen.

32:53.682 --> 32:57.652
Haha there are no
gentlemen. Ladies,

32:57.786 --> 33:01.023
You are going
to my home the kingdom of Allur.

33:01.157 --> 33:05.261
You might be aware of our
tradition of zuku zuku. Zuku

33:05.393 --> 33:10.599
zuku is more than love. Zuku
zuku is more than romance.

33:10.933 --> 33:13.668
Zuku zuku is more than sex.

33:13.835 --> 33:17.539
1,000 orgasms working as one.

33:17.907 --> 33:19.175
Zuku Zuku!

33:19.308 --> 33:20.910
Zuku Zuku!

33:21.043 --> 33:23.212
Wow, Zuku Zuku.

33:23.346 --> 33:24.412
Zuku Zuku!

33:24.546 --> 33:26.883
Lets do it!

33:36.058 --> 33:37.792
Wow, Wow. Woo Hoo, hoo!

34:25.573 --> 34:27.109
Good evening. I'm Talia Kaplan.

34:27.243 --> 34:29.245
Joining us tonight
is Evan Kleinman, the

34:29.378 --> 34:33.015
CEO of Evan Advanced Robotics
corporation, which is now

34:33.149 --> 34:36.218
bringing the tiny kingdom
of Allur back from bankruptcy.

34:36.352 --> 34:40.588
Thank you very much for joining
us. So why sex robots and why

34:40.722 --> 34:42.124
only the kingdom of Allur?

34:42.258 --> 34:43.525
Okay, First, things first.

34:43.658 --> 34:45.394
Is my
Instagram handle down there?

34:45.527 --> 34:46.929
Yeah, it is?

34:47.063 --> 34:51.033
I'm sorry, what was your
question? Right. Sex robots.

34:51.167 --> 34:53.868
Of course. Um,
yeah sex robots. It

34:54.003 --> 34:56.272
was an idea that I've had
brewing in the back of my head

34:56.405 --> 35:00.943
for, gosh, quite some time and
it's a concept I've come back

35:01.077 --> 35:05.348
to over and over again. You know
something I really believed in.

35:05.480 --> 35:09.185
You build all your robots right
here in Los Angeles yet you ship

35:09.318 --> 35:12.821
every single one to the
kingdom of Allur. Why?

35:12.955 --> 35:14.522
Well
you know I thought it would be a

35:14.656 --> 35:17.659
good place to start. I saw their
country really struggling and

35:17.792 --> 35:20.829
this was an opportunity
to get them back on track.

35:20.963 --> 35:23.232
You know at Evanbots
we're all about giving back.

35:23.366 --> 35:25.834
Alright, well when do you plan
to expand and when will you

35:25.968 --> 35:28.570
start selling these robots
right here in the United States.

35:28.703 --> 35:29.704
Soon, very soon.

35:29.838 --> 35:31.673
The contracts are in place and

35:31.806 --> 35:34.576
soon we will
have worldwide distribution.

35:34.709 --> 35:36.278
Alright, well that's all the

35:36.412 --> 35:38.747
time we have for tonight thank
you very much Evan Kleinman.

35:38.881 --> 35:41.250
Hold on, is my Instagram
handle down there? Yeah?

35:41.384 --> 35:43.119
Can you confirm, is it there?

35:43.252 --> 35:44.853
Alright,
well everybody have a good

35:44.987 --> 35:47.957
night. Thank you
so much for joining us.

35:49.425 --> 35:52.560
Wow, I love that.

35:55.965 --> 35:59.368
Yo that was awesome! Did
you guys see me! My followers

35:59.502 --> 36:01.037
are going through the roof.

36:01.170 --> 36:02.938
Barry we gotta
start production on

36:03.072 --> 36:04.839
these beautiful
babies immediately.

36:04.974 --> 36:07.877
You completely left me out.
You gave me no credit at all.

36:08.010 --> 36:11.180
Dude, I didn't wanna complicate
things, okay?

36:11.313 --> 36:13.215
We know you're the real deal.
Let the people think what they

36:13.349 --> 36:16.318
want. We're gonna need 10,000 of
these by the end of the month.

36:16.452 --> 36:17.420
Can you make that happen?

36:17.552 --> 36:18.421
Wait, wait, 10,000?

36:18.553 --> 36:19.455
Yes.

36:19.587 --> 36:20.855
Allur already has enough.

36:21.957 --> 36:23.225
You weren't serious about
what you said on the TV

36:23.359 --> 36:24.826
show right?
We're not expanding to America.

36:24.960 --> 36:26.362
If we bring the
robots here then what makes

36:26.495 --> 36:28.164
Allur so special,
what brings in the tourists?

36:28.297 --> 36:30.632
Look you didn't think we could
limit this to just one

36:30.765 --> 36:32.301
dinky little country did you?

36:32.435 --> 36:35.037
If we don't make and sell
these here somebody else will.

36:35.171 --> 36:39.942
Believe me, and what
good does that do Allur? Right?

36:40.076 --> 36:44.180
Okay, I saved your
kingdom dude. You're welcome.

36:44.313 --> 36:45.247
Thank you.

36:45.381 --> 36:47.615
Just trust me.

36:49.285 --> 36:53.788
I often ask
myself: is technology enough?

36:53.923 --> 36:56.125
If it isn't human...

36:56.758 --> 36:59.395
If it doesn't touch you...

36:59.528 --> 37:01.830
If it doesn't feel you up...

37:01.964 --> 37:06.601
and down, then
what is technology?

37:06.734 --> 37:08.703
But one more gizmo

37:08.837 --> 37:13.242
on the road to a
cold hard gizmo-ocracy.

37:13.375 --> 37:15.610
Let me put it this way.

37:15.945 --> 37:20.349
Sexual satisfaction. What is it?

37:21.317 --> 37:24.954
Can you touch it?
Can you hold it?

37:25.087 --> 37:29.657
You sure as hell can! Ladies
and gentleman introducing the

37:29.791 --> 37:33.262
Evanbots for the
American marketplace!

37:41.437 --> 37:43.973
And just like that the robots

37:44.106 --> 37:48.310
were sweeping horny Americans
all over the country.

37:48.444 --> 37:51.846
Yo I hear those robots perform
that zuku zuku shit man.

37:51.981 --> 37:55.317
This is what
we needed in America.

38:21.210 --> 38:24.446
Cheers to Evanbots and me
finally moving out of Barry's

38:24.580 --> 38:25.881
crappy apartment.

38:26.015 --> 38:28.217
Hey! Why
would you say that?

38:29.351 --> 38:30.452
I'm Evan!

38:30.586 --> 38:32.288
Oh.

38:32.421 --> 38:33.522
What's your name?

38:33.656 --> 38:35.624
I don't know.

38:35.757 --> 38:37.159
You
don't know your own name?

38:37.293 --> 38:40.563
No, I don't know if I
want to tell you my name.

38:40.695 --> 38:43.432
Oh, well maybe you do. I'm Evan

38:43.566 --> 38:47.236
of Evanbots and we're
kind of a hot company right now.

38:47.369 --> 38:50.406
Well, what do you
do, or make, or whatever?

38:50.539 --> 38:52.308
We make sex robots!

38:52.441 --> 38:55.344
Ew.

38:58.647 --> 39:01.217
What did you tell her?

39:01.716 --> 39:03.252
I don't know.

39:03.385 --> 39:07.523
Anyway, Steph you want to
run lines with me tomorrow?

39:07.656 --> 39:09.391
Sorry, I got a protest to

39:09.525 --> 39:12.328
attend outside
your factory tomorrow.

39:12.461 --> 39:14.330
Steph, come on.

39:14.463 --> 39:17.333
Okay, Wednesday!

39:18.534 --> 39:22.905
Oh, hey! Got here
quicker than I expected.

39:25.207 --> 39:28.810
Guys this is my cousin Vanessa.
Here have a seat.

39:29.478 --> 39:31.480
This is Evan.

39:33.215 --> 39:34.617
Well I have to go. I have some

39:34.749 --> 39:37.286
coding to get through
before I call it a night.

39:37.419 --> 39:39.888
Okay good night.
Oh, I gotta go to

39:40.022 --> 39:42.757
I'll see you guys.
Good night.

39:54.970 --> 39:57.506
What's your name?

39:57.640 --> 39:58.641
Vanessa.

39:58.773 --> 40:00.042
What is it?

40:00.175 --> 40:01.710
Vanessa.

40:01.843 --> 40:03.979
Oh.

40:04.913 --> 40:09.585
Although he was now
rich, Evan was still a bitch.

40:09.718 --> 40:12.388
We are better
than this as a society.

40:14.256 --> 40:16.325
When
men and women aren't equal this

40:16.458 --> 40:20.562
kind of grotesque
objectification will not stand!

40:22.531 --> 40:27.136
We aren't against sex. We aren't
against sexuality but we insist

40:27.269 --> 40:29.071
on two consenting adults to

40:29.204 --> 40:32.908
equal consent. Don't go! Shit!

40:36.278 --> 40:39.315
Wow, Steph, Steph. Steph.

40:39.448 --> 40:42.685
Again where
are all the protestors?

40:42.817 --> 40:44.219
It's not that funny.

40:44.353 --> 40:46.955
We are providing maximum
pleasures to people who have

40:47.089 --> 40:49.024
difficulty finding pleasure.

40:49.158 --> 40:52.695
It's for poor man who is
suffering from anxiety and

40:52.827 --> 40:55.264
doesn't have confidence
and good looks.

40:55.397 --> 40:56.532
What?

40:56.665 --> 40:58.367
It's for man who want to have
sex with women!

40:58.500 --> 41:02.870
And by the way no
one has good looks like me.

41:03.005 --> 41:04.707
It's a blessing from God!

41:04.839 --> 41:06.375
Hey Fahad!

41:06.508 --> 41:10.045
I got to go and good
luck with the protestors!

41:12.981 --> 41:15.751
Things were
going great for Evanbots.

41:15.884 --> 41:17.453
They got a Jew and an Asian guy

41:17.586 --> 41:20.189
with a gray wig to
give them additional funding for

41:20.322 --> 41:22.257
mass production
across the world.

41:41.744 --> 41:44.380
Barry look
at the ratio here. It's a bar

41:44.513 --> 41:48.550
full of women. How is it
possible, you're alone again?

41:50.753 --> 41:53.422
Look, do you plan on being
a virgin for the rest of your

41:53.555 --> 41:56.358
life?

41:56.992 --> 41:59.361
God.

41:59.495 --> 42:04.133
You know
you have really nice eyes.

42:04.366 --> 42:07.236
Nice eyes? That's all?

42:07.369 --> 42:11.640
Oh, and the
bags underneath them.

42:11.774 --> 42:13.242
Oh.

42:13.375 --> 42:16.078
I'm sorry I'm just not used to
being around somebody

42:16.211 --> 42:18.180
so beautiful.

42:18.313 --> 42:19.681
You know. You're a lot more

42:19.815 --> 42:22.017
charming than
you give yourself credit for.

42:22.151 --> 42:24.319
Evan, I'm so glad you made it.

42:24.453 --> 42:25.154
Hey!

42:25.287 --> 42:26.221
Isn't this place awesome?

42:26.355 --> 42:28.557
Yeah, yeah it's incredible.

42:28.690 --> 42:30.292
I'm Rachel, who are you?

42:30.426 --> 42:32.694
Vanessa.

42:32.928 --> 42:34.596
You lucky girl. Evan must have

42:34.730 --> 42:36.799
shown you his
VR toy in his bedroom.

42:36.932 --> 42:39.701
Oh no, no, no, no.
That's just...

42:39.835 --> 42:43.272
Yeah, uh anyway,
good seeing you and sorry for

42:43.405 --> 42:46.275
interrupting, but a bunch of us
are going golfing tomorrow with

42:46.408 --> 42:47.810
the real stars of Instagram and

42:47.943 --> 42:50.612
since you're way over 500k,
would you want to come?

42:50.746 --> 42:53.015
Yes! That would be awesome.

42:53.148 --> 42:54.616
Vanessa will join me.

42:54.750 --> 42:58.353
Yeah. Yeah.

43:00.122 --> 43:02.892
Yo bro. I love your robots!

43:03.025 --> 43:04.259
Thank you!

43:04.393 --> 43:05.794
Dude, four hours last night
with one.

43:05.929 --> 43:08.163
We aim to please.
It's in our mission statement.

43:08.297 --> 43:09.465
Do you follow me on Instagram?

43:09.598 --> 43:11.033
Of course I
follow you on Instagram.

43:11.166 --> 43:12.701
Wait for the updates on the
future bots.

43:12.835 --> 43:14.803
It's gonna blow your mind.

43:14.938 --> 43:16.505
Dude I love your selfies!

43:16.638 --> 43:17.706
Thank you.

43:17.840 --> 43:19.174
Evan Kleinman!

43:19.308 --> 43:21.176
Show him the present.

43:22.778 --> 43:25.647
Um, we baked
you a special cupcake.

43:27.149 --> 43:31.220
Um, thank you?

43:31.653 --> 43:33.322
Yeah, thanks.

43:33.455 --> 43:36.525
You're welcome bro.
Let's get out of here.

43:36.658 --> 43:39.127
See you guys.

43:40.462 --> 43:42.264
Do
you want to get out of here?

43:42.397 --> 43:44.032
Yes.

44:09.491 --> 44:12.227
That special cupcake had LSD,

44:12.361 --> 44:16.565
CBD, Propecia and Viagra in it.

44:40.522 --> 44:42.391
Hey Virgin.

44:43.158 --> 44:44.928
What?

44:45.060 --> 44:50.132
Virgin! Virgin! Virgin!

44:52.234 --> 44:54.603
Virgin Virgin Virgin!

44:54.736 --> 44:56.805
I said stop it!

45:13.923 --> 45:15.757
Hey Mate, you got a light?

45:18.360 --> 45:20.562
Hey mister, I don't bite.

45:29.973 --> 45:31.975
Mate you alright?

45:32.107 --> 45:34.176
You don't bite?

45:38.280 --> 45:42.451
Looks like you need a little
BP. Barry Penis.

45:42.584 --> 45:44.319
Say hello to little Barry.

45:48.457 --> 45:50.392
Come to the Barry.

46:03.271 --> 46:04.740
This is unacceptable.

46:04.873 --> 46:08.477
My client is clearly guilty!
I mean innocent!

46:08.610 --> 46:10.479
You need to
resign immediately otherwise the

46:10.612 --> 46:12.180
entire company will be
in jeopardy.

46:12.314 --> 46:14.616
I didn't know what was going on,
I don't remember any of this.

46:14.750 --> 46:17.887
It's all over Facebook,
Instagram, Snapchat.

46:18.021 --> 46:19.287
I mean even Twitter.

46:19.421 --> 46:21.223
Someone's out to get me.
Evan just tell the media

46:21.356 --> 46:22.925
someone's out to get me.

46:23.059 --> 46:24.660
Well I'm afraid
that's not going to cut it.

46:24.793 --> 46:28.898
Khalid, tell
them this isn't me. Tell them!

46:29.231 --> 46:31.233
It looks like you.

46:31.366 --> 46:32.300
Fahad?

46:32.434 --> 46:34.202
Not you, definitely not you.

46:34.336 --> 46:36.204
Evan will vouch
for me, won't you Evan?

46:36.338 --> 46:38.707
You sexually
assaulted a paparazzo, bro!

46:38.840 --> 46:41.044
I created this!

46:41.777 --> 46:44.346
Look, we got a
golf game to get to.

46:44.479 --> 46:48.850
Get rid of him. Do it quick.
Nothing personal, Barry.

46:51.020 --> 46:53.221
That's not cool!

46:54.856 --> 46:56.825
Don't touch me!

47:20.682 --> 47:24.553
Freeze! Darwin here.

47:26.688 --> 47:29.691
Oh, will you marry me Maria?

47:29.825 --> 47:32.995
My name isn't Maria, but yes.

47:33.129 --> 47:34.563
Yes.

47:40.569 --> 47:45.774
And last but not
least, Steph and Evan.

47:57.519 --> 47:59.454
You had your
chance Jonathan.

47:59.588 --> 48:01.790
I've moved on.

48:04.693 --> 48:07.930
One last time Elizabeth, that's
all I ask. Do the snake

48:08.064 --> 48:11.466
dance for me and I'll leave you
alone forever.

48:14.170 --> 48:18.373
One last time.

48:37.960 --> 48:41.363
Wow, Bravo! Bravo!

48:41.863 --> 48:45.433
Okay,
apparently Evan decided to

48:45.567 --> 48:49.138
take the knee on tonight's
performance.

48:49.272 --> 48:51.107
But one more question
before we conclude our

48:51.240 --> 48:55.410
evening of horrible theatre.
How many people here noticed

48:55.544 --> 48:58.513
that I've lost weight?

49:04.786 --> 49:08.024
How could he do this to me?

49:08.323 --> 49:10.927
Steph, the scene is over.

49:11.060 --> 49:13.595
And remember,
you have an opportunity

49:13.728 --> 49:17.133
to get back at him
on national TV tomorrow.

49:17.266 --> 49:19.367
Oh shit, the debate is tomorrow.

49:19.501 --> 49:20.735
Yes!

49:20.869 --> 49:21.736
Screw it.

49:21.870 --> 49:22.537
What?

49:22.671 --> 49:23.538
I want to get drunk.

49:23.672 --> 49:26.075
Oh. Oh, no no.

49:32.081 --> 49:35.218
You're kinda cute,
you know that?

49:35.350 --> 49:37.086
Yes I know that.

49:37.220 --> 49:39.088
You do?

49:39.222 --> 49:41.090
Of course I do.

49:42.724 --> 49:47.429
Do you maybe
want to come back to my place?

49:47.562 --> 49:50.665
Steph,
you have tremendous talent but

49:50.799 --> 49:52.034
Fahad needs to be with the

49:52.168 --> 49:56.005
prettiest
girl in the world! I'm sorry.

49:58.840 --> 50:02.044
You're talking about yourself
in the third person now?

50:02.178 --> 50:03.812
It's the king.
Fahad, we must go at once.

50:03.946 --> 50:06.349
Oh, the king,
okay. Take revenge!

50:06.481 --> 50:11.287
Oh, okay the king. Cheerio,
governor, pinkies up! Pip pip.

50:12.420 --> 50:17.626
Welcome to access Taliwood
with my co-host Rick Rainbow.

50:17.792 --> 50:19.295
Hi!

50:19.427 --> 50:22.864
Today show is solely dedicated
to talking about Evan Kleinman.

50:22.999 --> 50:26.434
That Evan
Kleinman is so hot right now.

50:26.568 --> 50:29.972
Yeah and guys he
is blowing up on social media.

50:30.106 --> 50:33.075
I just want to gobble
him up. Yum yum yum yum.

50:33.209 --> 50:37.179
This is great news! Are you guys
seeing this? This is incredible.

50:37.313 --> 50:38.747
Alright, I got to go.

50:38.881 --> 50:41.317
Wait a minute. I want
to talk to you about Steph.

50:41.449 --> 50:43.551
She's the only thing
on my mind right now, okay?

50:43.685 --> 50:45.354
But you stood
her up at the showcase.

50:45.487 --> 50:47.023
And she'll get over it.

50:47.156 --> 50:50.960
Oh really? You can really
be a dick sometimes. Asshole!

50:51.961 --> 50:53.195
So rude.

50:53.329 --> 50:55.131
You know what makes me
the most mad? Is that at the

50:55.264 --> 50:57.166
end of this I'm the stupid one
because I thought I'd give him

50:57.300 --> 50:58.800
him a chance to actually
come back and apologize

50:58.935 --> 51:00.702
and maybe try to talk
things out, but no, I'm

51:00.835 --> 51:02.972
the stupid one. He's
late to his own stupid show that

51:03.105 --> 51:03.805
I agreed to be on.

51:03.940 --> 51:04.974
He's coming.

51:05.107 --> 51:06.976
Unbelievable.

51:07.109 --> 51:08.010
Hey!

51:08.144 --> 51:09.979
Hey? Where
were you yesterday?

51:10.112 --> 51:11.247
Look, Steph.

51:11.380 --> 51:13.382
You know how important
that showcase was to me.

51:13.515 --> 51:16.185
I know and I'm sorry. Okay?

51:16.319 --> 51:18.653
Look I have a
million other things that are

51:18.787 --> 51:21.023
more important on
my plate right now.

51:21.190 --> 51:23.125
Other things
like your new friends?

51:23.259 --> 51:26.028
I was playing golf with the real
stars of Instagram. Me!

51:26.162 --> 51:29.165
Think about that for a
second. How incredible is that?

51:29.298 --> 51:30.632
Wow that's just...

51:30.765 --> 51:31.833
You're an asshole!

51:31.968 --> 51:33.802
And I fell asleep.
I had a snooze.

51:33.936 --> 51:35.737
That's
your excuse? Fatigue?

51:35.870 --> 51:38.074
Look the whole
world doesn't revolve around

51:38.207 --> 51:40.742
you and your stupid little
theatre scene. Okay?

51:40.876 --> 51:42.411
And in case you haven't noticed.
Wait!

51:42.544 --> 51:43.812
I don't even
show up to that anymore!

51:43.946 --> 51:45.348
We used
to be friends, remember?

51:45.480 --> 51:46.614
Yeah, when I was nobody.

51:46.748 --> 51:48.483
Oh, you are somebody, alright!

51:48.616 --> 51:50.152
I have followers now!

51:50.286 --> 51:53.322
Yeah, you have herpes following
you from your little girlfriend.

51:55.157 --> 51:57.826
Good evening and thank you for
watching talking with Talia.

51:57.960 --> 52:01.063
Joining us tonight is Evan
Kleinman the CEO of Evan

52:01.197 --> 52:04.433
Advanced Robotics Corporation
and we also have Sarah

52:04.566 --> 52:06.534
Stein-Goldberg, the
president of the

52:06.668 --> 52:09.871
feminist empowerment mission
advanced level experience, aka

52:10.006 --> 52:13.109
female. Thank you both
so very much for joining us.

52:13.242 --> 52:17.179
You, a man, don't have the right
to say that your robot girl toys

52:17.313 --> 52:18.713
aren't sexist.

52:18.847 --> 52:20.849
We're providing entertainment.

52:20.983 --> 52:23.452
For men. And what
kind of real man would prefer a

52:23.585 --> 52:25.988
doll to a living
breathing woman?

52:26.122 --> 52:29.691
Me! That'd be awesome.

52:29.992 --> 52:33.095
There's one guy.
You know you wouldn't believe

52:33.229 --> 52:36.531
how realistic the
breathing in our products are.

52:36.664 --> 52:39.868
Ugh, aren't you afraid these
plastic computers are going to

52:40.002 --> 52:42.405
get hacked, jeopardizing
the lives of millions?

52:42.537 --> 52:45.740
No our servers are triple secure

52:45.874 --> 52:49.078
and besides
there's a kill switch.

52:49.211 --> 52:50.379
A kill switch?

52:50.513 --> 52:51.646
That's right, with
one click of a button we can

52:51.780 --> 52:53.149
shut them all down.

52:53.282 --> 52:57.319
So if your hotbots aren't
sexist, why do you only

52:57.453 --> 52:59.221
manufacture female robots, huh?

52:59.355 --> 53:02.058
Why not make male
robots for the females to enjoy?

53:02.191 --> 53:05.895
You're right, you're right!
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

53:06.028 --> 53:07.897
We will immediately
begin development on

53:08.030 --> 53:09.731
male bots for the market.

53:09.864 --> 53:12.600
Follow me on Instagram at
Evan the CEO

53:12.734 --> 53:14.970
for updates on male bots!

53:15.104 --> 53:17.907
Ah, I'll definitely be trying
one of those! Well that's all

53:18.040 --> 53:20.342
the time we have for tonight
folks. Thank you for watching

53:20.476 --> 53:21.609
and have a good night.

53:21.743 --> 53:22.912
Thank you Steph!

53:23.045 --> 53:24.280
Why did you say that?

53:24.413 --> 53:26.916
We never discussed making
male robots and

53:27.049 --> 53:28.918
that's the sort of
thing you need to take to the-

53:29.051 --> 53:33.089
Shut up! Alright you work
for me! Look, I was challenged

53:33.222 --> 53:36.926
and I took up that challenge.
My followers demand it.

53:37.059 --> 53:38.327
This is way
too complicated.

53:38.461 --> 53:40.129
The job description
said all we'd have to do

53:40.262 --> 53:42.864
is have sex with robots.

53:42.998 --> 53:46.135
You know, Barry never really
told us what he was up to.

53:46.268 --> 53:49.238
He didn't exactly share.

53:49.405 --> 53:51.806
What the
hell am I paying you guys for?

53:51.941 --> 53:55.643
Maybe it is in our best
interest in bringing Barry back.

53:56.078 --> 54:00.116
I agree. One hundred percent.

54:02.084 --> 54:05.354
That Evan Kleinman
is so hot right now!

54:05.488 --> 54:09.158
Yeah, and guys he
is blowing up on social media.

54:09.291 --> 54:13.195
I just want to gobble him up.
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

54:22.304 --> 54:25.207
Hello?

54:28.978 --> 54:32.181
No, I'd love to come back.

54:50.499 --> 54:52.535
This or this?

54:52.667 --> 54:55.171
Do you think he's going to come?

54:55.638 --> 54:58.140
I don't know. We'll see.

55:12.154 --> 55:14.089
Thanks for coming
man, I appreciate it.

55:14.223 --> 55:16.091
No Problem.

55:16.225 --> 55:20.029
I bet you're
still mad at me, huh?

55:20.162 --> 55:24.400
I understand. It
wasn't personal.

55:24.732 --> 55:28.170
Exactly, it wasn't. So let's get
back to work man!

55:28.304 --> 55:30.239
You got a company
to build. Let's go.

55:30.372 --> 55:32.308
Let's!

55:40.382 --> 55:41.951
Yeah.

55:49.391 --> 55:51.060
I have never felt

55:51.193 --> 55:54.563
so uncomfortable
making a bot before.

55:54.697 --> 55:58.100
Especially the genitals.

55:58.733 --> 56:01.136
Would you like a massage?

56:11.413 --> 56:14.749
This is what
we needed in America!

56:21.390 --> 56:22.925
That's what I'm saying.

56:23.058 --> 56:24.893
All he does all day
is pay attention to me.

56:25.027 --> 56:27.296
It's creeping me out!

56:27.429 --> 56:28.897
Hello.

56:29.031 --> 56:31.300
I gotta go.

56:34.703 --> 56:35.837
What?

56:35.971 --> 56:38.307
Do you need a hug?

56:38.440 --> 56:40.109
I do not.

56:40.242 --> 56:43.712
Do you want to tell me
fascinating stories about the

56:43.845 --> 56:48.450
good times you've had with your
female friends. I'm all ears.

56:49.251 --> 56:50.919
No I want you to ignore me.

56:51.053 --> 56:54.256
Go watch
football on TV, away from me.

56:54.390 --> 56:57.126
But I'm
designed to only look at you.

56:57.259 --> 56:59.628
I give you the night
off! You are free to go.

56:59.762 --> 57:03.666
Go have fun with your friends,
get drunk, come home late.

57:03.798 --> 57:06.035
Oh, you want to have sex?

57:06.168 --> 57:08.270
No. Oh my god. Where's the box.

57:08.404 --> 57:11.373
I'm sending you back.
I need my money back.

57:11.507 --> 57:14.877
80 percent of the man bots are
being returned! I need a real

57:15.010 --> 57:18.681
man! That's what
she says, I need a real man.

57:18.813 --> 57:20.149
Don't they work right?

57:20.282 --> 57:21.884
I've heard the sex is fantastic.

57:22.017 --> 57:23.352
They work fine!

57:23.485 --> 57:25.954
The sex is fine!
It's not a technical issue.

57:26.088 --> 57:27.489
It's their attitude.

57:33.162 --> 57:37.166
Okay, I get it. I get it!
The man bots were a bust.

57:37.299 --> 57:39.168
You know,
Steph knew this would happen.

57:39.301 --> 57:40.502
She tricked me into this.

57:40.636 --> 57:43.372
Hey! Don't
blame this on Steph, okay?

57:43.505 --> 57:44.973
Right, We gotta go.

57:45.107 --> 57:46.742
Where are you going?

57:46.874 --> 57:50.779
The big show. Couple of the
year. Homosapian magazine!

57:52.581 --> 57:55.984
Homo... Sapians.

57:56.118 --> 57:58.187
You'll all be watching. I hope.

57:58.320 --> 57:59.955
Okay good luck.

58:00.089 --> 58:04.026
Oh, Barry, what are you doing?

58:04.326 --> 58:06.662
Figuring out how
to be able to remotely access

58:06.795 --> 58:09.698
neuro-structures of mammals
to be able to send customized

58:09.832 --> 58:11.734
signals spinally and ultimately

58:11.866 --> 58:13.902
modify the hypothalamus!

58:17.872 --> 58:19.742
Control their minds.

58:19.874 --> 58:21.009
Control their minds?

58:21.143 --> 58:22.344
Hhm, hmmm.

58:22.478 --> 58:25.514
Wow. Okay,
I gotta go to meet Steph.

58:25.647 --> 58:28.083
I'll see you.

58:46.902 --> 58:47.936
Hello!

58:48.070 --> 58:48.937
Hey!

58:49.071 --> 58:50.439
Welcome, come on in.

58:50.572 --> 58:52.975
Wow. Cool place.

58:53.108 --> 58:55.511
Oh, thank you. Woo.

58:57.846 --> 58:59.948
Hey, I really enjoyed
your script by the way.

59:00.082 --> 59:02.251
Oh, thank you,
I owe it to myself.

59:02.384 --> 59:04.153
By the way,
Evan and Vanessa are on

59:04.286 --> 59:05.854
TV, we
should probably watch them.

59:05.988 --> 59:07.156
Ugh, do we have to?

59:07.289 --> 59:09.925
Yes it's background noise.

59:10.058 --> 59:14.630
Fine, but the second he gets
obnoxious we turn it off right?

59:24.273 --> 59:26.742
Oh, we're gonna miss it.

59:26.876 --> 59:30.145
Right, um, that way?

59:30.279 --> 59:31.480
The TV is this way.

59:31.613 --> 59:32.347
Cool.

59:32.481 --> 59:35.150
Okay.
I'll be back!

59:38.954 --> 59:43.659
Dang, swanky place.

59:43.792 --> 59:45.360
I wish my
parents could get me something

59:45.494 --> 59:50.499
like this. What's this?
A big ass photo of you.

59:51.633 --> 59:53.735
Oh.

1:00:00.442 --> 1:00:03.512
Hey Steph, here is our scene.

1:00:06.215 --> 1:00:09.318
Oh. Ohhhh.

1:00:11.987 --> 1:00:14.556
Fahad, something wrong?

1:00:17.159 --> 1:00:18.694
Is this a mirror?

1:00:18.827 --> 1:00:20.195
Fahad, are you okay?

1:00:20.329 --> 1:00:21.530
Is this a mirror?

1:00:21.663 --> 1:00:22.932
Uh, yeah?

1:00:23.065 --> 1:00:25.033
Is this my face?

1:00:25.167 --> 1:00:26.668
You're joking right?

1:00:26.802 --> 1:00:27.937
Is this me?

1:00:28.070 --> 1:00:30.539
Uh, yeah?

1:00:30.672 --> 1:00:32.741
No! It's not me!

1:00:33.208 --> 1:00:36.645
No. Is it a mirror?

1:00:36.778 --> 1:00:38.213
Are you okay?

1:00:38.347 --> 1:00:40.048
It's not me. No it cannot be.

1:00:40.182 --> 1:00:41.717
Are you like
having a stroke or something?

1:00:41.850 --> 1:00:42.886
This me?

1:00:43.018 --> 1:00:44.219
Fahad, what is it?

1:00:44.353 --> 1:00:48.023
No! What did you do?

1:00:48.156 --> 1:00:49.558
That mirror was
covered for a reason!

1:00:49.691 --> 1:00:51.560
What? I didn't know!

1:00:54.096 --> 1:00:56.231
Fahad, Fahad
we have to talk.

1:00:56.365 --> 1:00:58.734
There is nothing you can say.

1:00:59.368 --> 1:01:02.371
I will never
star in any action movies!

1:01:02.504 --> 1:01:07.010
Fahad, we need to talk. You
have always looked this way.

1:01:07.142 --> 1:01:10.178
No! My mom told me that my
father told me that. Everyone

1:01:10.312 --> 1:01:12.714
told me do not look in mirror.

1:01:12.848 --> 1:01:17.386
Look at me now. I cannot
believe this is my face.

1:01:17.519 --> 1:01:19.755
Fahad you have
always looked this way.

1:01:19.889 --> 1:01:23.292
The mirror did not make you
ugly. It's just a mirror.

1:01:24.126 --> 1:01:25.227
There is no curse.

1:01:25.360 --> 1:01:28.031
No curse?
This is me? Is this me?

1:01:28.163 --> 1:01:30.499
It's always been me?

1:01:32.301 --> 1:01:33.335
No, no, no!

1:01:33.468 --> 1:01:34.938
No, no Fahad. No, no, no!

1:01:35.070 --> 1:01:38.140
I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you from all my heart!

1:01:38.273 --> 1:01:39.408
Fahad?

1:01:39.541 --> 1:01:40.742
He looked in the
mirror its not my fault!

1:01:40.877 --> 1:01:41.945
I swear it's not my fault!

1:01:42.077 --> 1:01:43.779
You lied to me, why?

1:01:43.913 --> 1:01:48.417
You are beautiful on the inside.

1:01:48.550 --> 1:01:50.719
Fahad, we were
trying to protect you.

1:01:50.852 --> 1:01:53.422
Your mother, she
wanted you to be happy.

1:01:53.555 --> 1:01:57.026
By hiding me from my own image?
Screw everything. Screw the

1:01:57.159 --> 1:01:59.761
Screw the company.
Screw the kingdom.

1:01:59.896 --> 1:02:04.266
Do not ever call
me again. Do not call me.

1:02:05.500 --> 1:02:09.705
Never. Do not call me!

1:02:21.583 --> 1:02:23.585
Come on Evan, pick up!

1:02:23.719 --> 1:02:27.456
Evans phone here.
Do you follow me on Instagram?

1:02:27.589 --> 1:02:32.794
If you don't I will not call you
back. At Evan the CEO.

1:02:36.531 --> 1:02:40.636
Despite the companies failure
with the manbots, Evan's stardom

1:02:40.769 --> 1:02:45.140
and relationship with Vanessa
rose to new levels of fame.

1:02:45.273 --> 1:02:48.477
Good evening everyone! And thank
you for watching goodnight with

1:02:48.610 --> 1:02:53.016
Talia. We have a fantastic
guest for you tonight, Evanessa!

1:02:53.148 --> 1:02:54.483
Couple of the year,

1:02:54.616 --> 1:02:57.887
welcome, welcome.
Hi, nice to meet you.

1:02:58.021 --> 1:03:01.490
Nice to see you again. Thank
you for being here and folks

1:03:01.623 --> 1:03:04.760
we are breaking every records
rating for a Tuesday night in

1:03:04.894 --> 1:03:08.031
July. Congratulations on being
named couple of the year.

1:03:08.163 --> 1:03:09.032
Thank you.

1:03:09.164 --> 1:03:10.900
Please have a seat.

1:03:11.034 --> 1:03:12.868
So tell me Evan how
did you guys first meet?

1:03:13.002 --> 1:03:15.905
Well we actually
met through her cousin, Barry.

1:03:16.039 --> 1:03:20.308
Probably the strangest, funniest
looking little guy I've ever

1:03:20.442 --> 1:03:23.612
known and he's Vanessa's
cousin and we were at

1:03:23.745 --> 1:03:26.515
Throw rooftop lounge one
night and she was there to meet

1:03:26.648 --> 1:03:28.717
him and
we've hit it off ever since.

1:03:28.850 --> 1:03:30.786
Oh, how romantic.

1:03:30.920 --> 1:03:33.855
Well, your robots, they are so
real why date a

1:03:33.990 --> 1:03:35.390
real woman, no offense.

1:03:35.524 --> 1:03:38.460
Well, yes our
robots are perfect,

1:03:38.593 --> 1:03:41.263
I mean perfection
personified but, uh-

1:03:42.065 --> 1:03:44.466
it's Vanessa's flaws
that I'm in love with.

1:03:44.599 --> 1:03:46.535
Ohhhh....

1:03:46.668 --> 1:03:48.837
Well, how does
it feel to be so famous, so

1:03:48.971 --> 1:03:53.241
beautiful, so successful, toast
of the town. Couple of the year.

1:03:53.375 --> 1:03:55.078
It feels
sensational Tamara. Just-

1:03:55.210 --> 1:03:56.445
Talia.

1:03:56.578 --> 1:03:59.015
Whatever, Tamara.
It's sensational and it

1:03:59.148 --> 1:04:01.550
feels really, really good.

1:04:01.683 --> 1:04:04.219
Yeah and there's a lot of people
I'd like to thank, uh,

1:04:04.352 --> 1:04:07.222
starting with, um,

1:04:07.355 --> 1:04:09.058
whatever, it doesn't matter
I don't remember their names

1:04:09.192 --> 1:04:14.596
anyways. But there is one thing
I would like to add.

1:04:15.397 --> 1:04:18.968
Vanessa, you
would be the perfect addition-

1:04:19.102 --> 1:04:20.903
to my portfolio.

1:04:21.037 --> 1:04:24.773
Oh my goodness,
it appears we have a proposal.

1:04:24.907 --> 1:04:26.109
What do you say?

1:04:26.241 --> 1:04:28.610
Will you marry me?

1:04:29.178 --> 1:04:30.579
Buenisimo.

1:04:30.712 --> 1:04:32.115
Oh, you speak Spanish.

1:04:32.247 --> 1:04:35.450
Suburashi. Zeh Tov Maod!

1:04:35.584 --> 1:04:38.587
Marhabban Marhabban Marhabban.

1:04:38.720 --> 1:04:42.024
Yes proceed to the
route. In and Out burger.

1:04:42.158 --> 1:04:43.291
Should we go to the sahara tent?

1:04:43.425 --> 1:04:44.359
Vanessa, the
whole world is watching.

1:04:44.493 --> 1:04:45.393
What are you doing?

1:04:45.527 --> 1:04:47.897
Pie equals 3.14159265359.

1:04:48.030 --> 1:04:50.099
Baby, baby, baby...

1:04:51.934 --> 1:04:53.936
Vanessa. Vanessa.

1:04:54.070 --> 1:04:58.673
Oh, my goodness! Breaking news
Vanessa is a robot!

1:05:00.243 --> 1:05:03.278
No! No!

1:05:03.411 --> 1:05:06.115
Evan, you're
a cheat. You're a fraud.

1:05:06.249 --> 1:05:08.151
No, no, no, no, no.
Get that off!

1:05:08.283 --> 1:05:10.219
You saw it here first guys.

1:05:10.352 --> 1:05:12.821
No! Vanessa, hey!

1:05:13.956 --> 1:05:15.057
Can you believe it?

1:05:15.191 --> 1:05:18.393
She was a robot
and he didn't even notice it.

1:05:18.527 --> 1:05:21.863
What an idiot!

1:05:24.133 --> 1:05:27.836
Ooh. Ooh.

1:05:31.773 --> 1:05:36.845
Señorita? Uh, hello? Help! Help!

1:05:39.282 --> 1:05:41.483
Hello, anyone? Help?

1:05:48.456 --> 1:05:50.893
All around the
world the robots were shutting

1:05:51.027 --> 1:05:52.895
off, but who did it?

1:05:53.029 --> 1:05:54.997
Even the
few remaining male bots

1:05:55.131 --> 1:05:57.599
were shutting down as well.

1:06:37.706 --> 1:06:40.442
It doesn't sicken
you to sit with someone so ugly?

1:06:40.575 --> 1:06:42.711
You're not ugly.

1:06:42.844 --> 1:06:46.715
Thank you, but
you are wrong about that.

1:06:47.950 --> 1:06:49.718
Looks aren't everything.
Haven't you ever heard

1:06:49.851 --> 1:06:51.586
don't judge a
book by it's cover.

1:06:51.720 --> 1:06:54.891
Writers say this,
publishers know it's not true.

1:06:55.024 --> 1:06:57.726
Well, your script
has nothing to do with looks and

1:06:57.859 --> 1:07:01.197
it's very good.
Beautiful in fact.

1:07:01.330 --> 1:07:05.101
What is this? Why
you didn't tell me I was ugly?

1:07:05.234 --> 1:07:08.337
Why? Why! What is this?

1:07:08.470 --> 1:07:11.040
You didn't ask.

1:07:14.210 --> 1:07:18.147
I was attracted to you
because of your attitude anyway.

1:07:20.082 --> 1:07:22.885
Confidence is hot.

1:07:24.186 --> 1:07:28.423
Really? I like that.

1:07:29.091 --> 1:07:30.859
I like this.

1:07:31.894 --> 1:07:33.963
What is this?
What is this?

1:07:45.107 --> 1:07:47.742
Hey, Good morning.

1:07:50.012 --> 1:07:51.380
Morning.

1:07:51.513 --> 1:07:53.581
Son, did you sleep well?

1:07:53.715 --> 1:07:56.185
Do you still fit into your bed?

1:07:57.119 --> 1:07:58.421
Yeah.

1:07:58.553 --> 1:08:02.224
Listen, you know
we're very proud of you.

1:08:03.591 --> 1:08:05.127
Don't be.

1:08:05.261 --> 1:08:08.397
What are you talking about? You
made so much money and you went

1:08:08.530 --> 1:08:09.798
after what you wanted.

1:08:09.932 --> 1:08:11.800
Yeah, I abandoned all my friends

1:08:11.934 --> 1:08:16.405
to fall in love with a robot
and now I'm left with nothing.

1:08:16.538 --> 1:08:19.474
I know that this is what you
don't want to be right now,

1:08:19.607 --> 1:08:23.812
back home with your parents.
What you had is what you wanted,

1:08:23.946 --> 1:08:27.216
were you ever actually happy?

1:08:28.483 --> 1:08:32.989
Yeah, I thought I was, you know.

1:08:33.122 --> 1:08:35.958
But looking back at it,
Vanessa, just

1:08:36.092 --> 1:08:39.996
did whatever I wanted and
agreed with everything I said.

1:08:40.129 --> 1:08:42.697
And
you know she never did fart.

1:08:42.965 --> 1:08:45.734
Farting is not good
for relationships.

1:08:45.867 --> 1:08:47.403
Listen to me,

1:08:47.535 --> 1:08:51.440
I know that you and I haven't
seen eye to eye and I know I've

1:08:51.573 --> 1:08:53.242
been very tough on you, but this

1:08:53.376 --> 1:08:56.745
is the best advice
I can give you right now.

1:09:05.187 --> 1:09:06.489
Listen to me,

1:09:06.621 --> 1:09:10.558
fame and success can give you a
sense of false confidence.

1:09:12.061 --> 1:09:14.997
Here you have the fame.
Here you have the success.

1:09:15.131 --> 1:09:17.732
You have an opportunity here!

1:09:17.866 --> 1:09:19.868
Which is what?

1:09:20.336 --> 1:09:23.638
From everything bad something
good comes out.

1:09:23.772 --> 1:09:26.608
Use your notoriety
for good things.

1:09:26.741 --> 1:09:29.345
Heal your inner wounds.

1:09:29.478 --> 1:09:32.081
Amend your wrong doing.

1:09:32.214 --> 1:09:35.885
And make it up to your
friends by doing something good.

1:09:36.018 --> 1:09:41.090
Isn't that all what the bots are
about, helping lonely men?

1:09:41.790 --> 1:09:45.995
I mean, Yeah I guess.
In a way, sure.

1:09:51.033 --> 1:09:54.437
Oh my God, I hate my life.

1:10:05.780 --> 1:10:09.385
Ah! I can't feel
the zuku zuku with you.

1:10:09.518 --> 1:10:11.353
Excuse me, the what?

1:10:11.487 --> 1:10:16.292
I would love to be alone,
would you please just leave?

1:10:17.126 --> 1:10:20.196
My pleasure.

1:10:22.064 --> 1:10:24.300
I know you
are a hot girl...

1:10:26.268 --> 1:10:28.370
Sorry.

1:10:29.371 --> 1:10:31.307
Hey! Fahad around?

1:10:31.440 --> 1:10:32.707
Oh, that looks good.

1:10:32.841 --> 1:10:35.677
I know. Just don't touch.

1:10:35.978 --> 1:10:40.648
I'm so beautiful, woohoo!

1:10:41.450 --> 1:10:42.817
So beautiful!

1:10:42.952 --> 1:10:45.154
Someone's feeling better.

1:10:45.521 --> 1:10:47.356
Oh guys, I have news from Allur.

1:10:47.490 --> 1:10:50.493
With the robots gone, tourism is
back up a tad, but-

1:10:50.625 --> 1:10:52.495
it's still a bad situation.

1:10:52.694 --> 1:10:56.265
My movie could have saved
Allur, but we don't have money.

1:10:56.398 --> 1:10:58.334
No money. No honey.

1:10:58.467 --> 1:10:59.701
No.

1:10:59.834 --> 1:11:02.104
No? We didn't
lose all that money?

1:11:02.238 --> 1:11:04.974
Do you think I'm some kind
of dummy? I cashed in our

1:11:05.107 --> 1:11:07.709
investment after we made a
killing on the American Launch.

1:11:07.842 --> 1:11:10.712
Wow! Wow!
Wow! So amazing!

1:11:10.845 --> 1:11:13.048
Man you are so beautiful.

1:11:13.182 --> 1:11:14.483
So are you.

1:11:14.617 --> 1:11:17.319
So Khalid if you guys sold your
stake in Evanbots like forever

1:11:17.453 --> 1:11:19.588
ago, what were
you guys still doing there?

1:11:19.721 --> 1:11:22.657
I liked having friends.

1:11:22.992 --> 1:11:25.427
Plus it was a way to keep
Fahad away from mirrors.

1:11:25.561 --> 1:11:29.331
Yeah. I know who's going
to be the star in my movie.

1:11:29.465 --> 1:11:32.535
Well. You're going to have
talk to my agent about that.

1:11:32.700 --> 1:11:34.203
I thought you
were my agent too.

1:11:34.336 --> 1:11:36.405
I'm nobody's agent.

1:11:39.807 --> 1:11:43.179
Bye Fahad!

1:11:45.347 --> 1:11:46.382
Who's this?

1:11:46.515 --> 1:11:50.319
She is no one.

1:11:50.452 --> 1:11:51.887
Where are you going?

1:11:52.021 --> 1:11:54.323
Hey come on Steph!

1:11:55.224 --> 1:12:00.029
What did I do, what with
all the girls. Oh my...

1:12:01.497 --> 1:12:03.365
Oh, she brought this for me?

1:12:03.499 --> 1:12:07.069
Uh huh, enjoy.

1:12:07.369 --> 1:12:09.038
Wow, Steph!

1:12:09.171 --> 1:12:11.706
You know just last
week I was having a heart to

1:12:11.839 --> 1:12:16.912
heart with my weed smoking
construction working dad the

1:12:17.046 --> 1:12:20.616
other day and it made me realize

1:12:20.748 --> 1:12:25.820
that what I thought
I wanted wasn't in fact true.

1:12:25.955 --> 1:12:28.057
I was just
seeking fame for all the wrong

1:12:28.190 --> 1:12:32.928
reasons and I realized that I,
me, myself.

1:12:33.062 --> 1:12:34.930
Was enough and I didn't

1:12:35.064 --> 1:12:38.267
need Instagram followers to feel

1:12:38.400 --> 1:12:42.938
complete and um, you
know I quickly realized

1:12:43.072 --> 1:12:46.175
that farting in relationships
that was important,

1:12:46.308 --> 1:12:49.744
not the fame, not the followers.

1:12:49.878 --> 1:12:54.416
And I really owe my dad for that
one. Even if he is a stoner.

1:12:55.918 --> 1:12:59.555
Thank you so much, I'll take
any questions you might have.

1:12:59.688 --> 1:13:01.290
Yeah, you in the front.

1:13:01.423 --> 1:13:04.426
Um, what was it like when you
realized you hit your lowest.

1:13:04.560 --> 1:13:06.729
My lowest?

1:13:07.229 --> 1:13:10.966
I'm horny!

1:13:11.233 --> 1:13:15.170
Um that's not really a
question, but okay. You there!

1:13:15.304 --> 1:13:17.172
I'm horny, too!

1:13:17.306 --> 1:13:19.375
Babe what are you doing?
We just got back from Cabo.

1:13:19.508 --> 1:13:22.411
Also not a question.
These aren't questions!

1:13:22.544 --> 1:13:25.047
Fahad! Get out of here!

1:13:25.180 --> 1:13:27.182
Fahad! The warehouse!

1:13:27.316 --> 1:13:30.519
I'm horny! I'm horny. I'm horny.

1:13:38.627 --> 1:13:41.263
Hi Steph.

1:13:42.598 --> 1:13:46.001
I liked the cake.

1:13:46.135 --> 1:13:49.972
You probably
think I'm a sexist asshole.

1:13:51.006 --> 1:13:55.277
Steph when
I found out I was ugly,

1:13:55.411 --> 1:13:58.147
I wasn't sure if I
could be attractive anymore.

1:13:58.280 --> 1:14:01.317
So you had to get
your dick wet to test it out.

1:14:01.717 --> 1:14:03.919
Yes.

1:14:04.153 --> 1:14:06.854
How'd that work out for you?

1:14:06.989 --> 1:14:09.358
Terrible.

1:14:09.491 --> 1:14:11.360
Good.

1:14:11.493 --> 1:14:13.362
Steph,

1:14:15.064 --> 1:14:18.634
I feel
different when I'm around you.

1:14:18.901 --> 1:14:20.369
You do?

1:14:20.502 --> 1:14:24.807
Yes, I do. Because you
accepted me for who I am and

1:14:24.940 --> 1:14:30.245
allowed me to accept myself. You
make me feel like I'm enough.

1:14:34.183 --> 1:14:38.087
That eyebrow is enough.

1:14:45.027 --> 1:14:49.698
I'm so horny. I'm so horny.

1:14:49.832 --> 1:14:51.400
I'm so horny. I'm so horny.

1:14:51.533 --> 1:14:52.534
No, no, no, no!

1:14:52.668 --> 1:14:53.569
Woah, woah, woah.

1:14:53.702 --> 1:14:54.937
I'm so horny. So horny.

1:14:55.070 --> 1:14:57.039
No, no, no, no!
Woah, woah, woah!

1:14:57.172 --> 1:14:58.807
So horny. So horny!

1:14:58.941 --> 1:15:00.409
It's not the right place.

1:15:00.542 --> 1:15:02.544
Oh, huh, ho.

1:15:02.678 --> 1:15:04.747
What are you doing?
It's not the right place.

1:15:04.880 --> 1:15:06.281
Oh!

1:15:06.415 --> 1:15:09.418
Quite the overactive
hypothalamus she has there.

1:15:09.551 --> 1:15:11.253
Barry,

1:15:11.387 --> 1:15:14.957
Barry, to the warehouse.
Barry-

1:15:15.090 --> 1:15:16.291
Barry!

1:15:16.425 --> 1:15:18.227
Fahad help!

1:15:18.360 --> 1:15:22.564
You go save yourself,
it's too late for me!

1:15:24.099 --> 1:15:25.601
State and
local officials are warning

1:15:25.734 --> 1:15:28.904
everyone to stay inside lock
your doors and close your

1:15:29.037 --> 1:15:32.574
windows. Or don't.

1:15:33.175 --> 1:15:37.579
Ooh, It's getting hot in here.
Ooh.

1:15:37.713 --> 1:15:38.847
You know what?

1:15:38.981 --> 1:15:41.316
That's all the time we have for-

1:15:41.450 --> 1:15:43.051
Gotta go!

1:15:56.265 --> 1:16:00.869
Barry! Barry! Barry!
The switch. Barry!

1:16:01.003 --> 1:16:02.337
You!
What are you doing here?

1:16:02.471 --> 1:16:03.572
Darwin.

1:16:03.705 --> 1:16:05.340
Do not call me Darwin.
I am not Darwin anymore.

1:16:05.474 --> 1:16:06.742
Okay! Douchebag!

1:16:06.876 --> 1:16:09.945
I knew that you were
causing all these problems.

1:16:10.078 --> 1:16:11.079
Me?
Yes, you!

1:16:11.213 --> 1:16:12.448
Me?
Yes, you!

1:16:12.581 --> 1:16:14.216
You're the one who
destroyed this company,

1:16:14.349 --> 1:16:16.718
ruined my life by hitting the
kill switch and now

1:16:16.852 --> 1:16:17.887
you want to torment me further?

1:16:18.020 --> 1:16:18.922
I didn't do that.

1:16:19.054 --> 1:16:19.889
It was you.

1:16:20.022 --> 1:16:21.623
No! Darwin, It was you.

1:16:21.757 --> 1:16:25.929
You and your disgusting moles
and stupid singular eyebrow.

1:16:26.061 --> 1:16:27.763
Hey guys.

1:16:42.444 --> 1:16:45.113
Long time, no see my friends!

1:16:45.247 --> 1:16:47.182
Welcome back to Evanbots.

1:16:47.316 --> 1:16:50.619
Or should I say Barry Bots.

1:16:50.752 --> 1:16:54.823
The company,
The company that I created!

1:16:54.958 --> 1:16:56.525
Oh you have nothing to say?

1:16:56.658 --> 1:16:57.526
Oh, oh.

1:17:00.462 --> 1:17:02.531
You didn't
tell me Vanessa was a robot.

1:17:02.664 --> 1:17:04.934
Whoah!

1:17:05.868 --> 1:17:08.737
I created Vanessa
to amp up your self esteem.

1:17:08.871 --> 1:17:10.940
Hey! You're welcome.

1:17:11.073 --> 1:17:15.344
Also you said no one could
ever fall in love with a robot.

1:17:15.477 --> 1:17:18.313
Well you did, didn't you.

1:17:18.447 --> 1:17:19.114
Boop!

1:17:19.248 --> 1:17:20.415
Ah go to Hell.

1:17:20.549 --> 1:17:22.818
I thought we were friends.

1:17:22.952 --> 1:17:25.889
And then you kicked me
out of my own company!

1:17:26.021 --> 1:17:28.223
And because you two ruined me

1:17:28.357 --> 1:17:31.560
I was the one who
shut everything down.

1:17:31.693 --> 1:17:34.363
What? You didn't do it?

1:17:34.496 --> 1:17:37.099
I just told
you, I didn't do this.

1:17:37.466 --> 1:17:41.336
Shhhh.

1:17:42.838 --> 1:17:44.974
I wanted you two
to witness me losing my

1:17:45.107 --> 1:17:47.543
virginity first hand.

1:17:47.676 --> 1:17:48.810
Drumroll please.

1:17:48.945 --> 1:17:50.445
Oh!

1:17:50.579 --> 1:17:52.080
Wooo!!

1:17:52.214 --> 1:17:54.583
I created a bioweapon

1:17:54.716 --> 1:17:57.386
that affects the neurons in
women and

1:17:57.519 --> 1:18:01.623
allows me to control them.

1:18:04.126 --> 1:18:08.797
Barry! Barry Barry Barry Barry!

1:18:15.237 --> 1:18:16.738
Holy shit.

1:18:16.872 --> 1:18:20.475
Yes! Every woman in the
world now wants to have sex

1:18:20.609 --> 1:18:25.814
with me. Real women, not rubber.

1:18:25.982 --> 1:18:30.987
No no no no, No!
Oh fudge.

1:18:31.520 --> 1:18:33.855
Enjoy the show boys.

1:18:40.629 --> 1:18:43.732
Barry! Barry! Barry. Barry.

1:18:52.641 --> 1:18:53.508
Darwin.

1:18:53.642 --> 1:18:54.676
I'm not Darwin.

1:18:54.810 --> 1:18:58.113
You are Darwin.
You've always been Darwin.

1:18:58.246 --> 1:19:00.984
Darwin, think!

1:19:01.116 --> 1:19:02.317
Hi. I'm Steph.

1:19:02.451 --> 1:19:03.452
Steph, nice to meet you.

1:19:03.585 --> 1:19:05.021
Nice to meet you too.

1:19:05.153 --> 1:19:08.091
I was attracted to you
because of your attitude anyway.

1:19:08.223 --> 1:19:10.927
I feel different
when I'm around you.

1:19:11.060 --> 1:19:13.829
Wow. Bravo, bravo.

1:19:13.963 --> 1:19:17.265
STEPH; Your kinda
cute you know that.

1:19:22.471 --> 1:19:26.009
It is I, Darwin to the rescue.

1:19:26.141 --> 1:19:28.377
Now bite the rope off.

1:19:28.510 --> 1:19:29.811
Why am I doing the biting?

1:19:29.946 --> 1:19:31.914
Because you have
those nice American teeth.

1:19:32.048 --> 1:19:32.982
Do it!

1:19:33.116 --> 1:19:35.283
Alright, alright!

1:19:35.417 --> 1:19:38.787
Oh no! Noooo!

1:19:38.921 --> 1:19:43.458
Barry! Barry! Barry!

1:19:49.331 --> 1:19:51.600
Woooohooo!

1:19:51.733 --> 1:19:55.303
Yes, Untie me.
Darwin untie me. Go!

1:19:56.171 --> 1:19:57.706
Darwin Save us!

1:19:57.839 --> 1:20:01.376
What if? What if?

1:20:07.516 --> 1:20:11.219
What happened?
What's going on? What?

1:20:13.455 --> 1:20:14.723
Where are you going?

1:20:14.856 --> 1:20:15.524
Where are we?

1:20:15.657 --> 1:20:16.926
Who the hell are you?

1:20:17.060 --> 1:20:18.794
Ew, what a creep.
Let's get out of here.

1:20:18.928 --> 1:20:20.328
Come back!

1:20:20.462 --> 1:20:23.066
Barry! Of course it was
you. You and your virginity.

1:20:23.198 --> 1:20:24.067
Evan.

1:20:24.199 --> 1:20:25.068
I knew it was you.

1:20:25.200 --> 1:20:26.069
I didn't mean to do it.

1:20:28.203 --> 1:20:29.738
Steph?

1:20:29.871 --> 1:20:30.940
Where's Fahad?

1:20:31.074 --> 1:20:31.941
In here.

1:20:32.075 --> 1:20:33.876
Fahad!

1:20:34.010 --> 1:20:36.645
Fahad! Fahad!

1:20:39.481 --> 1:20:41.550
Oh my God.
I'm so glad you're okay.

1:20:41.683 --> 1:20:45.754
Yeah, I'm okay.
I'm so happy to see you.

1:20:45.888 --> 1:20:48.490
I'm so happy too.

1:20:48.623 --> 1:20:51.860
Don't move. It's over.

1:20:52.561 --> 1:20:54.563
Hey you guys!
Oh my god I'm so happy to

1:20:54.696 --> 1:20:57.100
see you. Look I
was such a dick and

1:20:57.232 --> 1:21:00.469
I'm sorry I can see that now.
Okay, the fame, it just,

1:21:00.602 --> 1:21:02.138
it went to my head.

1:21:02.270 --> 1:21:05.208
Alright? I don't know how else
to put this, but you guys are my

1:21:05.340 --> 1:21:07.076
best friends.
Will you forgive me?

1:21:07.210 --> 1:21:09.611
Oh Fahad. I love you buddy.

1:21:09.745 --> 1:21:11.948
You are beautiful.
Thank you so much.

1:21:12.081 --> 1:21:13.983
Don't be a
dick sometimes.

1:21:14.117 --> 1:21:15.051
I love you.

1:21:15.184 --> 1:21:17.419
It's good to have you back.

1:21:17.552 --> 1:21:19.055
Darwin you saved us.

1:21:19.188 --> 1:21:21.924
I'm not
Darwin. I'm Fahad.

1:21:22.390 --> 1:21:23.993
I love you guys.

1:21:24.127 --> 1:21:25.995
We love you too.

1:22:02.098 --> 1:22:04.066
I don't get it.
Aren't they like royal?

1:22:04.200 --> 1:22:05.902
Why are they getting
married in her backyard?

1:22:06.035 --> 1:22:09.939
It's a jewish wedding. The
bride side pays for everything.

1:22:10.106 --> 1:22:13.575
We are gathered here
today to witness the generic

1:22:13.708 --> 1:22:18.580
non-denominational union of two
beautiful people, Fahad and

1:22:18.713 --> 1:22:23.052
Steph, who I had the great
pleasure to meet just last week.

1:22:26.321 --> 1:22:27.355
Oh father!

1:22:27.489 --> 1:22:28.356
Fahad!

1:22:28.490 --> 1:22:29.724
What are you doing here?

1:22:29.858 --> 1:22:31.827
You saved the kingdom!
Everybody wants to come

1:22:31.961 --> 1:22:35.231
to Allur to see famous
action Hollywood movie star

1:22:35.363 --> 1:22:37.432
Fahad Bin Alawi!

1:22:37.566 --> 1:22:38.700
The country is abuzz.

1:22:38.834 --> 1:22:41.003
Tourism is back
and stronger than ever.

1:22:41.137 --> 1:22:42.337
Woo! That's incredible!

1:22:42.470 --> 1:22:44.106
Fahad, you're incredible.

1:22:44.240 --> 1:22:46.876
Thank you. Thank you.

1:22:47.009 --> 1:22:49.011
Kiss the bride.

1:22:49.145 --> 1:22:51.580
You may now kiss the bride.

1:22:53.481 --> 1:22:57.220
And so Fahad did it.
He became a famous action movie

1:22:57.352 --> 1:23:01.891
star and he saved his country
all at the same time.

1:23:02.024 --> 1:23:05.493
Life was good
for the ugly fellow.

1:23:11.167 --> 1:23:12.034
Hello.

1:23:12.168 --> 1:23:13.903
Hi, Congratulations.

1:23:14.036 --> 1:23:15.104
Thank you.

1:23:15.238 --> 1:23:16.705
Where are you two
going on your honeymoon?

1:23:16.838 --> 1:23:19.708
Oh, we
are going to North Dakota.

1:23:19.841 --> 1:23:22.711
Oh yes, the
obvious choice of course.

1:23:22.844 --> 1:23:24.779
For the opening of
Sex Action the movie.

1:23:24.914 --> 1:23:26.715
Oh, we won't be
there for a long time because

1:23:26.848 --> 1:23:29.919
we are going to open
movie studios in Allur.

1:23:30.052 --> 1:23:33.588
You're saying there's going
to be a sequel to the remake of

1:23:33.722 --> 1:23:35.490
the adaptation
of the television show?

1:23:35.624 --> 1:23:37.059
Absolutely.

1:23:37.193 --> 1:23:38.727
Well who's going to be
in it except for you, of course.

1:23:38.860 --> 1:23:40.729
Oh, you will
have to ask my agent.

1:23:40.862 --> 1:23:42.731
No, no, no. My
client deserves 10 times that

1:23:42.864 --> 1:23:44.733
amount are you crazy?

1:23:44.866 --> 1:23:47.370
I will tell you
one thing. There will be a big

1:23:47.535 --> 1:23:50.472
part for my friend Evan!

1:23:52.174 --> 1:23:56.279
Fahad, no no no.
I'm done with the spotlight man.

1:23:56.411 --> 1:23:57.479
It's over.

1:23:57.612 --> 1:24:00.548
Is that Darwin? Hi!

1:24:00.682 --> 1:24:02.817
Hi ladies. How you doing?

1:24:02.952 --> 1:24:04.954
My God, sorry. Can we take a
picture with you? Please...

1:24:05.087 --> 1:24:06.222
Yeah, of course.

1:24:06.355 --> 1:24:07.622
Oh my God. I can't
believe this is happening.

1:24:07.756 --> 1:24:10.059
Thank you so much!

1:24:10.192 --> 1:24:12.295
Darwin! Wow, Wow, Wow!!

1:24:12.427 --> 1:24:14.297
Darwin here. I can't believe it!

1:24:14.429 --> 1:24:17.666
Fahad, I'm so proud of you, you
showed the world that you can be

1:24:17.799 --> 1:24:20.403
not hot and
still be an action movie star.

1:24:20.535 --> 1:24:21.971
Yes.

1:24:23.571 --> 1:24:25.874
That's awesome, Darwin!

1:24:29.979 --> 1:24:30.845
Hey.

1:24:30.980 --> 1:24:31.646
Hi.

1:24:31.780 --> 1:24:32.847
How's it going?

1:24:32.982 --> 1:24:33.682
Good.

1:24:33.815 --> 1:24:34.849
Pretty good wedding, huh?

1:24:34.984 --> 1:24:36.851
Mhm, yeah.

1:24:37.353 --> 1:24:38.620
Um-

1:24:38.753 --> 1:24:40.923
Before we flirt any further,

1:24:41.057 --> 1:24:45.328
you, you aren't a
robot by chance are you?

1:24:45.460 --> 1:24:46.861
No.

1:24:46.996 --> 1:24:47.862
No?

1:24:47.997 --> 1:24:49.398
No.

1:24:49.531 --> 1:24:50.433
Do you want to dance?

1:24:50.565 --> 1:24:51.833
Yeah.

1:24:51.968 --> 1:24:55.470
Thank you. Meet
me on the dance floor. Come on.
