- A terrible lawyer.

- Jimmy, you never won a case.
- I'm right for this one.

00:24.991 --> 00:28.494
You gave the tobacco case
to Lindsay even though
she'd never done a jury trial.

00:28.561 --> 00:30.463
You had a feeling
and you went with it.

You took this
court-appointed, right?
Mm-hmm.

That means your fee tops
at 700.

leap <i>to the conclusion...</i>

01:22.014 --> 01:25.150
that Kenny Tripp is a pimp.

01:29.354 --> 01:32.224
What kind of evidence
is that?

[ Prosecutor ]
Now, what kind of story
was his?

01:34.926 --> 01:39.498
"She was paying off
on a football bet."
That's what Kenny Tripp says.

<i>A woman is observed</i>
<i>orally copulating a man.</i>

01:43.435 --> 01:46.505

with two previous convictions
for running a prostitution ring.

01:53.278 --> 01:56.348
And he says
she was paying him...

01:56.415 --> 02:01.285
because the Dolphins
didn't cover against
the Patriots.

02:01.353 --> 02:03.688
No offense, but I liked
his closing better than yours.

02:03.755 --> 02:06.558
Look, this case is
completely circumstantial.
We have a very good shot.

02:06.625 --> 02:09.259
Plus, we have grounds
for an appeal.
Let's not forget that.

02:09.327 --> 02:11.530
Yeah, but I still think
if we put in I got a girlfriend,

02:11.596 --> 02:13.632
it would have made me look
loving and caring.

02:13.698 --> 02:16.100
We were limited by the
fact that you don't have
a girlfriend, Kenny.

02:16.167 --> 02:19.337
Yeah, but if you had put it in,
I would have got one.
How'd it go?

02:19.403 --> 02:21.572
Great for the D.A.
I gotta pee.

02:21.639 --> 02:25.343
Listen, they're not gonna
follow me in there and, like,
give me a urine test, are they?

02:25.409 --> 02:28.512
- I think you're safe.
- Okay.

Oh, damn right I did.

02:39.257 --> 02:42.360
The thought of beating you

for me to resist. Hey, Ellie.

- How you doin', Renee?
- But you won't beat me.

02:45.129 --> 02:47.531

is one eyewitness.

Um, I know you're excellent
defending armed robbers,

Mm-hmm.

03:08.386 --> 03:10.387
Uh, don't bet him,

No, no, no.

Nothing. I told him
I couldn't talk to him,
but it's still communication.

06:10.064 --> 06:13.033
I had a communication
with a juror. I gotta go
to the judge.

- But you didn't
communicate with him.
- But even so,

not to Kenny.

any money?

there he was again.

09:25.123 --> 09:27.825

You knew the exact time.
You provide a lot of detail.

10:06.130 --> 10:08.399
But when it came time
to describing the suspect,

10:08.465 --> 10:11.668
you just said,
"Black," "one leg."

10:11.735 --> 10:13.404
<i>That's it.</i>

10:13.470 --> 10:16.640
I think that description limits
the field, Mr. Young.
Yes.

10:16.707 --> 10:20.411
But you don't describe
anything about his face,
except the color.

10:20.477 --> 10:24.281

23:30.155 --> 23:33.192
Obviously, we made
a considerable misjudgment.

23:33.258 --> 23:36.561
- For which we feel the client--
- I'm not overturning
the conviction.

23:36.628 --> 23:39.598
Your client participated
in this dishonesty.

23:39.664 --> 23:42.434
And I'm certainly not going
to reward him for it.

23:42.501 --> 23:44.636
The guilty verdict stands.

23:44.703 --> 23:47.071
So as not
to punish him unduly...

23:47.138 --> 23:50.842
for the blatant and illegal
action of his attorneys,

23:50.909 --> 23:52.911
I'll sentence him
to six months--

23:52.977 --> 23:56.481
the same term that the D.A.
was offering.

23:56.548 --> 24:00.184
Thank you.
As for the two of you,

24:00.251 --> 24:03.455
I'll be referring you to
the Board of Bar Overseers.

24:03.522 --> 24:05.657
And I'll be recommending
immediate disbarment.

24:08.192 --> 24:11.395
Don't you-- Don't you think
that's a little severe?

24:11.462 --> 24:13.598
Not a bit.

24:15.166 --> 24:17.635
That's all.

24:23.407 --> 24:26.177
The defense calls
Theodore Maynard.

24:35.819 --> 24:37.921
Your Honor, may I approach?

24:44.662 --> 24:47.565
Your Honor,
as an officer of the court,

24:47.631 --> 24:51.169
I have to let my client
testify in the narrative.

24:51.235 --> 24:54.405
Did you try to dissuade him
from testifying, counsel?

24:54.472 --> 24:55.806
I did.
Yeah, right.

24:55.873 --> 24:57.575
I did!

24:57.641 --> 25:00.911
- He insisted.
- Step back.

25:03.981 --> 25:08.986
Members of the jury,
a little departure
from the norm.

25:09.052 --> 25:14.291
Mr. Maynard,
instead of testifying
in the usual "Q" and "A" form,

25:14.357 --> 25:18.929
is simply going to state
his version of the events
in the narrative form.

25:18.996 --> 25:23.066
Now this is done sometimes.
It's just a different style.

25:23.133 --> 25:26.770
Okay, sir.
Please state your name
for the record.

25:26.837 --> 25:29.606
And then you may begin.

25:29.672 --> 25:33.977
My name's Theodore Maynard,
though everybody that knows me
just calls me Teddy.

25:34.044 --> 25:36.880
Shall I tell 'em now
about how I lost my leg,
or just stick to this case?

25:36.947 --> 25:41.051
- The case.
- Oh. All right.

25:41.118 --> 25:45.122
It was a cold, dark night.
Kind of a clammy night.

25:45.188 --> 25:48.691
Kind of night where
you just knew somethin' bad
was gonna happen.

25:50.393 --> 25:53.196
[ Jimmy ]
Just a couple questions,
Dr. Manheim.

25:53.263 --> 25:56.899
I appreciate
you taking the time.
Certainly.

25:56.966 --> 25:59.969
Your dog,
his name is Ross?
<i>Yes.</i>

26:00.036 --> 26:02.839
I had an Uncle Ross once.
Dead.

26:02.905 --> 26:06.142
Got the gout.
It isn't relevant to this here.

26:06.208 --> 26:08.545
<i>He's a rottweiler?</i>
<i>[ Dr. Manheim ]</i>
<i>Yes, he is.</i>

26:08.611 --> 26:11.648
<i>[ Jimmy ]</i>
<i>Beautiful dogs,</i>
<i>if you like the big kind.</i>

26:11.714 --> 26:15.918
Now, when your rottweiler
bit Susan Stevenson, did you
actually see what happened, sir?

26:15.985 --> 26:20.723
Well, I was talking to somebody
else in the park, so my eyes
were going back and forth.

26:20.790 --> 26:23.760
Mm-hmm. Who would this
other person be, sir?

26:23.826 --> 26:26.195
It was a woman.
Someone I just met,
actually.

26:26.262 --> 26:30.066
She was walking her dog
as well. Both animals were
on a leash, by the way.

26:30.132 --> 26:32.601
I see.
Uh, you say you just met?

26:32.668 --> 26:36.105
Uh, you wouldn't have gotten
her name, would you?
Maybe a phone number?

26:36.172 --> 26:38.140
- Actually, yes, I did.
- Oh, good.

26:38.207 --> 26:41.277
That makes things easier.
I'll get that later.
Uh, her dog.

26:41.343 --> 26:43.579
What kind was that?
I think it was a shar-pei.

26:43.645 --> 26:47.783
Shar-pei?
An old girlfriend told me
I looked like a shar-pei.

26:47.849 --> 26:50.952
Personally, I didn't see it.

26:51.020 --> 26:53.255
It isn't relevant
to this here.

26:53.322 --> 26:57.393
Perhaps... since we're all
busy people, you could stick
to what is relevant here.

26:57.459 --> 27:00.929
Of course.
Uh, you said, uh, you were
looking back and forth.

27:00.996 --> 27:02.964
What did you see,
if you remember?

27:03.031 --> 27:07.135
Well, I noticed a young girl
looking at Ross.

27:07.202 --> 27:11.740
I think she then
made a sudden movement,
as if to pet him.

27:11.807 --> 27:14.242
And I think she startled him.
That's when he nipped her.

27:14.309 --> 27:17.078
Is, uh, your dog fixed?

27:17.145 --> 27:20.315
Or, uh, you know,
are you planning puppies?

27:20.381 --> 27:23.619
Neither.
When did you get
this dog, Doctor?

27:23.685 --> 27:25.721
About three years ago.

27:25.787 --> 27:29.090
That's in the interrogatories,
as are all the answers
to these questions.

27:29.157 --> 27:31.627
I know. Uh, sorry.

27:31.693 --> 27:35.797
I was doing some checking,
and I noticed your condo
on the North End...

27:35.864 --> 27:38.834
got robbed a week before
you got this rottweiler.

27:38.900 --> 27:42.437
Would that be
a coincidence?
Not exactly.

27:42.503 --> 27:46.141
[ Jimmy ]
You got this dog for some kind
of security thing.

27:46.207 --> 27:49.677
In part. Also as a pet.
Ever take it to any
dog obedience school?

27:49.744 --> 27:51.846
No, I trained him myself.
Oh.

27:51.913 --> 27:55.216
So, uh, you would be aware on
the behavior of these animals?

27:55.283 --> 27:59.220
- Come on, counsel.
- Well, I-- No, I don't mean,
like, you're an expert.

27:59.287 --> 28:01.089
Just some basic things.

28:01.156 --> 28:03.991
Are you aware
that rottweilers are
an aggressive breed?

28:04.058 --> 28:07.362
More aggressive
than average, yes.

28:07.428 --> 28:11.198
And you'd know that males,
especially un-neutered males,
are most aggressive.

28:11.266 --> 28:16.170
I don't think I knew that,
but I believe you
if you say it's so.

28:16.236 --> 28:18.806
Now, you said
you saw the little girl
looking at the dog.

28:18.873 --> 28:20.775
Did you know that looking
into a dog's eyes...

28:20.841 --> 28:24.178
is likely to be interpreted
by the animal
as an aggressive challenge?

28:25.580 --> 28:27.414
No, I didn't know that.
Okay.

28:27.482 --> 28:31.586
Uh, what kind of, uh, food
do you give him, generally?

28:31.652 --> 28:34.789
Dog food! Scraps
from the table sometimes.

28:34.855 --> 28:37.324
High on protein?
I haven't any idea.

28:37.391 --> 28:39.827
Do you know
that a high protein diet...

28:39.894 --> 28:42.863
for these kinds of animals
can make 'em more aggressive?

28:42.930 --> 28:45.432
No, I didn't
know that, counsel.

28:45.499 --> 28:47.935
This is kind
of a dangerous animal
you got, Doctor.

28:48.002 --> 28:50.204
<i>I'd think you'd check up</i>
<i>on some of these things.</i>

28:50.270 --> 28:53.207
Could we just please
ask questions?

28:53.273 --> 28:57.677
The woman you met at the park--
By the way, did you ever
see her again?

28:57.744 --> 29:00.114
Yes, we had dinner
a few times.

29:00.180 --> 29:03.917
I think I'll take her name
and number now.

29:11.325 --> 29:14.261
Hey. How'd it go?

29:18.332 --> 29:20.900
<i>How'd it go?</i>
<i>[ Door Closes ]</i>

29:20.967 --> 29:25.839
What? Oh, uh,
Kenny got six months.

29:25.905 --> 29:28.241
<i>He's, um--</i>

29:28.307 --> 29:31.210
He's out, pending appeal
on the probable cause issue.

29:31.277 --> 29:35.682
With any luck, uh,
we'll get him out altogether.
Ah, cool.

29:35.749 --> 29:38.084
We, on the other hand, uh--

29:39.686 --> 29:42.622
What?

29:42.689 --> 29:44.658
Things didn't go
so good for us.

29:44.724 --> 29:47.226
What happened?

29:49.829 --> 29:52.331
We're getting disbarred.
And it's her fault.

29:52.398 --> 29:54.467
- What?
- I should have never
listened to you.

29:54.533 --> 29:56.936
- What?
- You know, "Don't tell!
Don't tell!"

29:57.003 --> 29:59.906
- We were both
in on this, Lindsay.
- You kept saying, "Don't tell."

29:59.973 --> 30:01.607
[ Ellenor ]
Don't put the whole thing
off on me!

30:01.674 --> 30:04.477
- Hey!
- You're the one
who talked to the juror!

30:04.543 --> 30:07.180
There's a deposition
goin' on in here.
What's goin' on?

30:07.246 --> 30:10.616
You tell him.
No, you tell him.
That way you can allocate blame.

30:10.683 --> 30:13.252
I was saying from the start
we shouldn't take the chance.
You could have recused yourself.

30:13.319 --> 30:15.888
- You could have gone forward
on your own accord.
- <i>Hey!</i>

30:15.954 --> 30:18.257
Let's go to my office...
now.

30:20.593 --> 30:23.662
It's not that she wouldn't
give me the change.

30:23.729 --> 30:26.164
I get rejection every day.

30:26.231 --> 30:29.001
But the way she wouldn't
even look at me,

30:29.067 --> 30:31.770
like it would bring her down
to acknowledge I was there.

30:31.837 --> 30:35.408
Now, I joke about things
all the time.

30:35.474 --> 30:37.943
In fact, that's how I get by.
I make jokes.
[ Chuckles ]

30:38.010 --> 30:41.680
See, usually I can make
everything a joke.

30:41.747 --> 30:44.617
But this one
kind of stuck with me.

30:44.683 --> 30:48.854
<i>Anyway, I went around</i>
<i>the corner on Tremont,</i>

30:48.921 --> 30:50.856
where we all kinda hang out.

30:50.923 --> 30:54.526
You know, panhandler central.
And Joey Free, the guy
I told you about earlier?

30:54.592 --> 30:58.663
He's also got one leg.
He starts yellin' at me
for bein' a victim.

30:58.730 --> 31:01.900
Sayin' feelin' sorry for myself
was my worst problem.

31:01.967 --> 31:06.638
And I just snapped back, "Easy
for you to say, Mr. Crutch.
I can't even afford crutches!"

31:06.704 --> 31:11.109
And Joey, he just jumps up,
throws his crutches
to the ground and hops off.

31:11.176 --> 31:15.313
About a minute later,
he comes back, throws a wallet
at me and says, "See?

31:15.380 --> 31:17.282
I'm no victim."

31:17.349 --> 31:20.552
The man had jumped up and
snatched that woman's wallet.

31:20.618 --> 31:23.155
Now, I had it
when the police came.
I certainly did.

31:23.221 --> 31:25.923
But I didn't take it.
It was Joey Free.

31:25.990 --> 31:31.829
'Cept Free is not
his real last name. I kinda
don't want to turn him in.

31:31.896 --> 31:34.966
There's certain codes
we gotta live by.

31:35.032 --> 31:37.769
But I'll be honest about this,

31:37.835 --> 31:41.338
though I'm sure my lawyer
will probably berate me
for it later.

31:42.974 --> 31:45.643
I wish it was me.

31:45.710 --> 31:49.213
I wish I was
the guy that jumped up
and took that woman's money.

31:49.280 --> 31:53.885
I'd be sittin' here prouder
today if I hopped up to that
woman and said, "I exist!"

31:53.951 --> 31:56.287
Now, I don't believe
in stealin'.

31:56.353 --> 32:00.457
But if she was keepin' in her
wallet the idea that some people
are less worthy than her,

32:00.524 --> 32:02.459
then I'm glad she lost it.

32:02.526 --> 32:04.495
Now, I didn't take it.

32:04.561 --> 32:08.065
But I'd be proud to sit here
and say that I did.

32:08.132 --> 32:10.234
And that's the truth.

32:19.243 --> 32:21.078
Why didn't you come
to me with this?

32:21.145 --> 32:24.548
Because you would have gone
along with it. And then you'd
be in the same trouble we are.

32:24.615 --> 32:26.983
I wouldn't have gone along!
I would have told the judge!

32:27.050 --> 32:30.020
- Oh, please, Bobby!
You never would--
- It was jury tampering!

32:30.086 --> 32:33.424
- We didn't tamper.
We only withheld--
- Ellenor, for God's sake,

32:33.490 --> 32:36.092
communication with a juror,
you go straight to the judge!

32:36.159 --> 32:37.928
- No question.
- Even if we're gonna forfeit--

32:37.994 --> 32:40.130
No question!

32:41.532 --> 32:44.334
This is--
This is beyond stupid.

32:44.401 --> 32:48.271
You risked your careers.
You completely jeopardized the
reputation of this entire firm.

32:48.338 --> 32:51.074
<i>What the hell could</i>
<i>you have been thinking?</i>

32:51.141 --> 32:53.043
- "The reputation of this firm."
- What?

32:53.109 --> 32:56.146
- Nothing.
- Hey!

32:57.781 --> 33:00.050
The reputation of this firm
doesn't matter to you?

33:00.116 --> 33:02.686
Bobby, all we did
was live up to your example.

33:04.554 --> 33:08.391
You just sold out a client--
Lyle Roberts.
Let's not forget that.

33:08.458 --> 33:13.563
You just finished arguing
jury nullification.

33:13.629 --> 33:16.900
You got a murderer off
on the moral integrity...

33:16.967 --> 33:19.469
of his cold-blooded execution.

33:21.537 --> 33:24.107
What exactly do you think
our reputation is here, Bobby?

33:24.174 --> 33:26.509
I mean, who are you kidding?

And what Lindsay and I did
may not have been ethical,

33:45.728 --> 33:50.199
it was completely
in the spirit and the tradition
of Bobby Donnell.

through the walls.

She's not I.D.'ing
the man who held her up.

36:07.868 --> 36:10.938
She's identifying the man
she saw in police custody.

36:11.004 --> 36:14.174
She sees a one-legged man
in the lineup,
she figures it must be him.

36:14.241 --> 36:16.476
<i>She wants it to be the guy.</i>

36:16.543 --> 36:19.680
We all do,
so that we can feel safe--

36:19.747 --> 36:22.883
that the bad guy
is off the street.

36:22.950 --> 36:26.053
<i>What are the chances</i>
<i>there could have been</i>
<i>somebody else...</i>

36:26.119 --> 36:28.822
there that night
with just one leg?

36:28.889 --> 36:32.759
Of course she was going
to conclude that the man
they had must be the guy.

36:32.825 --> 36:37.530
But remember,
she really couldn't identify
the man's face.

36:37.597 --> 36:42.502
She didn't give the police
any description other than
"Black, one leg." That was it.

36:42.569 --> 36:45.872
- Objection. This is too much.
- <i>Counsel, get up here.</i>

36:52.745 --> 36:56.283
I'm sorry, Your Honor,
but this goes
way over the line.

36:56.349 --> 36:58.150
I mean,
to recruit black amputees...

36:58.218 --> 37:01.454
to walk into the room
in the middle of
his closing argument?

37:01.521 --> 37:04.256
I mean, that--
that's unbelievable,
even for him.

37:04.324 --> 37:06.459
I'm shocked.

37:06.526 --> 37:08.961
Did you enlist those
one-legged black people?

37:09.028 --> 37:12.331
Your Honor, my client is
in an amputee support group.

37:12.398 --> 37:15.735
- His friends came to his trial.
- Oh, right.

37:15.802 --> 37:17.870
What do you think of me?

37:17.937 --> 37:20.239
- Counsel--
- They could have used crutches.

37:20.306 --> 37:23.375
Or, I don't know,
maybe a wheelchair?

37:23.442 --> 37:26.245
He deliberately
had them hop.

37:26.312 --> 37:28.214
I'm not sure this is something
you can appeal.

37:28.280 --> 37:33.485
Now, let him finish
his closing. Please.

37:35.187 --> 37:37.289
Step back.

37:38.457 --> 37:41.560
200,000? Yesterday,
you said 75,000.

37:41.627 --> 37:43.662
- Well, today I got more facts.
- Oh, you've got more facts?

37:43.729 --> 37:46.265
I've got more facts.
Let's hear your "facts."

37:46.332 --> 37:48.800
The facts are your guy
bought a security dog--

37:48.867 --> 37:52.338
a dangerous instrument
he took no steps to train
or even learn about.

37:52.404 --> 37:55.341
Either he didn't know
the risks of this animal,
which makes him negligent,

37:55.407 --> 37:57.609
or he did, which
makes him reckless--
your pick.

37:57.676 --> 37:59.978
So, 200,000--
I'm not finished
with my facts.

38:00.045 --> 38:03.249
Oh. Oh, well, go ahead.
You want me to go ahead?

38:03.315 --> 38:06.818
I said, "go ahead."
This was preventable.

38:06.885 --> 38:09.287
Dogs like this need
to be socialized.
This one wasn't.

38:09.355 --> 38:12.791
Dogs like this need to be
taught submissive behavior.
This one wasn't.

38:12.858 --> 38:15.961
Dogs like this should
be fed low protein.
This one wasn't.

38:16.027 --> 38:19.430
If he chooses to dispense
with these precautions, fine.

38:19.498 --> 38:22.400
It's his choice.
He takes the risk.

38:22.467 --> 38:24.903
But if he's
gonna go to a park--
a children's park--

38:24.970 --> 38:27.606
and hit up on women
and not even pay attention...

38:27.673 --> 38:32.077
when he knows a child
is two feet from
his security rottweiler,

38:32.143 --> 38:34.379
he puts the child
at risk too.

38:34.445 --> 38:36.581
She lost her face.

38:36.647 --> 38:39.785
He got a phone number
and a couple of dinner dates.

38:39.851 --> 38:42.153
That's what
the jury's gonna hear.

38:42.220 --> 38:45.223
Is that right?
That's right.

38:45.290 --> 38:49.027
200,000. Nothing less.

38:49.094 --> 38:51.997
I'll see you in court.

38:52.063 --> 38:53.898
I doubt it.

38:56.767 --> 38:58.569
What is this?

38:59.837 --> 39:04.509
Um, hi.
Yes, hi.

39:04.575 --> 39:07.077
[ Sighs ]
One alternative offer.

39:07.144 --> 39:09.347
What? What? What?

39:09.414 --> 39:13.818
150,000 and whatever
it takes to fix her face.

39:13.884 --> 39:16.654
Excuse me?
Your client's a doctor
at Mass General.

39:16.721 --> 39:18.656
I'm sure he's got lots
of colleagues.

39:18.723 --> 39:21.426
And I'm not talking
about one operation.

39:21.492 --> 39:27.164
It's whatever it takes
to make her the pretty girl
she was pre-rottweiler.

39:27.231 --> 39:31.501
That could turn out to be
cheaper than 200,000
if he gets the right doctors.

39:31.569 --> 39:36.106
150,000 and her smile.

39:36.173 --> 39:38.075
Final offer.

39:40.945 --> 39:43.480
Tell Eugene he can wait here.
He doesn't have to
wait down at court.

39:43.547 --> 39:45.349
Bobby, he expects
the jury back any minute.

39:45.415 --> 39:47.818
This doesn't even
involve Eugene.
This does involve Eugene.

39:47.885 --> 39:50.855
This is a meeting
about this firm. Eugene
is a member of this firm.

39:50.921 --> 39:53.690
Fine.
Ellenor!

39:53.757 --> 39:56.293
Look, let's just start.
He gets here when
he gets here, okay?

39:56.360 --> 40:00.297
Okay, first,
the disbarment proceeding,
I will represent both of you.

40:00.364 --> 40:02.732
We shouldn't
get independent counsel?
We probably should,

40:02.799 --> 40:06.070
but on this, I think
I can be more persuasive.

40:06.136 --> 40:08.138
Okay, now,

40:08.205 --> 40:12.108
let's clear the air
about all this being
in the spirit of <i>my</i> tradition.

40:12.176 --> 40:15.345
Ellenor.
I cleared my air
yesterday, Bobby.

40:15.412 --> 40:20.884
We bend, we fold, we mutilate
all the rules around here.
It's like our motto.

40:20.950 --> 40:23.387
Would you agree with that,
Lindsay?

40:23.453 --> 40:25.354
Well, pretty much.

40:25.422 --> 40:27.390
Jimmy?

40:27.457 --> 40:29.826
I don't know.

40:29.893 --> 40:33.497
<i>Truth is,</i>
<i>I don't know what we are.</i>

40:33.563 --> 40:36.533
I think what we are
and what we could be
are two different things.

40:36.600 --> 40:40.036
- Meaning?
- Meaning we've been a firm
that'll represent anybody.

40:40.103 --> 40:42.906
Financially, we've had to.
And the clientele we have--
You know, let's face it.

40:42.972 --> 40:46.142
The "reputation"
that we're honorable,
that we play by the rules,

40:46.209 --> 40:48.812
that would cost us
our clients.

40:48.878 --> 40:52.715
<i>The Kenny Tripps which make</i>
<i>up this practice, they rely</i>
<i>on us to cheat a little.</i>

40:52.782 --> 40:54.783
To stick up for them first,
the rules second.

40:54.851 --> 40:57.453
You know, they might love us,
but to the legal community,

40:57.520 --> 40:59.555
we're the lawyers
who give lawyers a bad name.

40:59.622 --> 41:02.291
The bread and butter
that's kept us afloat,

41:02.358 --> 41:05.061
it's mainly been
the drug dealers,
the Kenny Tripps.

41:05.128 --> 41:07.630
How do we just abandon them?
[ Ellenor ]
Look, we abandon them...

41:07.696 --> 41:11.334
because there are plenty
of other lawyers who are
desperate to do that work.

41:11.400 --> 41:14.703
We're not that
desperate anymore.

41:16.239 --> 41:19.342
Or maybe you're more desperate
than you could ever know.

41:19.408 --> 41:21.209
And what's that
supposed to mean?

41:21.277 --> 41:24.012
It means maybe you like
it here in the trenches.

41:24.079 --> 41:27.316
You know, maybe you
don't want to climb out.

41:27.383 --> 41:31.920
But if so, be honest about it
so we can get out while
we still have the chance.

41:34.156 --> 41:37.460
In the matter
ofCommonwealth versus
Theodore Maynard,

41:37.526 --> 41:40.996
on charge 62434,

41:41.063 --> 41:43.398
we, the jury,
find the defendant...

41:43.465 --> 41:45.601
not guilty.

41:45.668 --> 41:48.771

All right!
- <i>[ Maynard Laughing ]</i>

41:48.837 --> 41:50.939
Thank you, Mr. Young.
You were awesome, man.

41:51.006 --> 41:55.110
- I'm even gonna pay you.
- Oh, that's nice,
but, Teddy--

41:55.177 --> 41:58.881
Look. Look, I know, all right?
I'm gonna stay clear
from this kind of crap.

41:58.947 --> 42:01.950
I need to grow up.
I'm gonna.

Does it ever bother you...

42:07.990 --> 42:12.360

off on acquittals

Oh.

42:22.036 --> 42:25.707

pay off some of this debt
by taking you to dinner.

You're... separated, Eugene.

for his dad to be

Anyway, congratulations, again,
on your wonderful victory.

43:10.985 --> 43:14.288
Um, I'll...

43:14.355 --> 43:16.557
Yeah.

<i>[ Door Closes ]</i>

43:26.600 --> 43:28.602
I don't--
I don't believe it!

43:28.669 --> 43:32.939
I'm still in
a little shock myself.
$140,000!

43:33.006 --> 43:35.776
Plus as many operations
as it takes
to fix her smile.

43:36.943 --> 43:41.314
I-- I don't know
what to say.

43:41.382 --> 43:45.486
- Well, you gotta say "yes"
before I go--
- Oh, well, yes! My God, yes!

43:45.552 --> 43:48.054
I-- I-I--
I'd like to go tell her.

43:51.391 --> 43:54.360
Oh, and they know that I--
I don't have medical
insurance and--

43:54.427 --> 43:57.430
No hospital costs,
period.
I'll get it in writing.

43:57.497 --> 44:02.002
We can make appointments
for her to meet with the plastic
surgeon as soon as we close.

44:02.068 --> 44:05.638
Well, I owe you all
a big apology because...

44:05.705 --> 44:08.208
you don't know what
I was thinkin' of you all.

44:13.213 --> 44:15.815
This is really true?

44:15.882 --> 44:18.418
- All true.
- [ Laughs ]

44:18.484 --> 44:20.353
Thank you.

44:26.359 --> 44:29.662
Am I to understand that
instead of accepting 200,000,

44:29.729 --> 44:33.133
you settled on 140,000,
plus hospital care?

44:33.199 --> 44:37.203
- Yeah.
- You realize we can't take a
contingency on a girl's smile?

44:37.270 --> 44:39.905
If you had settled for 200,000
on a straight cash deal,

44:39.972 --> 44:42.775
this firm would have made
an extra $16,000.

44:42.976 --> 44:46.942
You do know that?
It crossed my mind.

you don't know
