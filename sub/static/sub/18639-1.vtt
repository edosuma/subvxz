00:30.513 --> 00:32.933
<i>The Hindenburg is coming again.</i>

00:33.033 --> 00:35.352
<i>That's what all the excitement is about.</i>

00:35.452 --> 00:37.229
<i>In spite of protests like this...</i>

00:37.329 --> 00:40.983
<i>the pride of Germany is due here
on the morning of May 6.</i>

00:41.083 --> 00:43.068
<i>During the 1937 season...</i>

00:43.168 --> 00:46.363
<i>the giant airship is scheduled
to make 18 round trips...</i>

00:46.463 --> 00:48.907
<i>from Frankfurt to Lakehurst, New Jersey.</i>

00:49.407 --> 00:52.886
<i>Just 150 years ago,
the Montgolfier brothers, two Frenchmen...</i>

00:52.986 --> 00:55.956
<i>made the first controlled flight
in a hot-air balloon.</i>

00:56.056 --> 00:59.835
<i>This rock-a-bye baby is perkin' along
with a new gas: hydrogen.</i>

00:59.935 --> 01:03.464
<i>Soon, an airborne banana split
with four scoops.</i>

01:03.564 --> 01:06.675
<i>In the Gay Nineties,
ballooning really got off the ground.</i>

01:06.775 --> 01:10.179
<i>Ladies, check the balloon sleeves on
those stylish aeronauts in the basket.</i>

01:10.279 --> 01:12.681
<i>By the early 1900s everyone agreed...</i>

01:12.781 --> 01:15.267
<i>an airship should be shaped
like a cigar.</i>

01:15.367 --> 01:18.812
<i>Yes, sir, what the world needed
was a good five-cent flying machine.</i>

01:18.912 --> 01:22.274
<i>Alberto Santos-Dumont,
a young Brazilian in Paris...</i>

01:22.374 --> 01:24.193
<i>achieved a major breakthrough...</i>

01:24.293 --> 01:27.738
<i>when he hooked a two-cylinder
gasoline motor to the basket.</i>

01:27.838 --> 01:29.490
<i>Flat tire, Alberto?</i>

01:29.590 --> 01:32.618
<i>All the same, he went on to win
the 100,000-franc prize...</i>

01:32.718 --> 01:36.723
<i>for circling the Eiffel Tower
in his 80-foot Tootsie Roll.</i>

01:38.640 --> 01:40.542
<i>Next came the semirigid airship...</i>

01:40.642 --> 01:42.836
<i>with a light metal frame supported by...</i>

01:42.936 --> 01:44.563
<i>Oops!</i>

01:47.149 --> 01:48.550
<i>Things are looking up.</i>

01:48.650 --> 01:52.012
<i>These early birds have
more varieties than Heinz.</i>

01:52.112 --> 01:54.765
<i>Bigger and better airships,
all of them air-conditioned...</i>

01:54.865 --> 01:58.727
<i>continued to pop up
before the World War.</i>

01:58.827 --> 02:00.020
<i>The outdoor types.</i>

02:00.120 --> 02:02.397
<i>With a girl along,
that probably was more fun...</i>

02:02.497 --> 02:04.733
<i>than the rumble seat of a Stutz Bearcat.</i>

02:04.833 --> 02:07.903
<i>Around this time,
a retired German army officer...</i>

02:08.002 --> 02:10.948
<i>known as the crazy old
Count von Zeppelin...</i>

02:11.048 --> 02:16.119
<i>flew a 400-foot sausage equipped
with two marine motors for 20 miles.</i>

02:16.219 --> 02:18.914
<i>But seriously, folks,
after this amazing feat...</i>

02:19.014 --> 02:22.167
<i>everyone wanted to be associated
with the Zeppelin Company.</i>

02:22.267 --> 02:25.546
<i>The count and a young associate,
Dr. Hugo Eckener...</i>

02:25.646 --> 02:29.132
<i>founded the world's first
air passenger line.</i>

02:29.232 --> 02:30.884
<i>In 1924...</i>

02:30.984 --> 02:33.679
<i>the Zeppelin Company built
an airship for the U.S. Navy...</i>

02:33.779 --> 02:37.224
<i>the LZ 126,
rechristened "The Los Angeles".</i>

02:37.324 --> 02:39.393
<i>Until last year the Graf Zeppelin...</i>

02:39.493 --> 02:41.562
<i>was considered the marvel of the age.</i>

02:41.662 --> 02:46.567
<i>Since 1928 she has carried 13,000
passengers over a million miles...</i>

02:46.667 --> 02:48.652
<i>without a single mishap.</i>

02:48.752 --> 02:52.364
<i>But then, at the Zeppelin Company
works in Friedrichshafen...</i>

02:52.464 --> 02:57.119
<i>German genius created
the airship supreme: the Hindenburg.</i>

02:57.219 --> 03:01.290
<i>Her vast, cathedral-like hull,
almost three football fields long...</i>

03:01.390 --> 03:05.544
<i>is an intricate web spun from more
than ten miles of duralumin girders.</i>

03:05.644 --> 03:07.254
<i>Fifteen stories high...</i>

03:07.354 --> 03:12.301
<i>it houses 16 giant cells containing
over 7 million cubic feet of hydrogen...</i>

03:12.401 --> 03:16.388
<i>which lifts her 242 tons
of luxury into the clouds.</i>

03:16.488 --> 03:19.933
<i>She is the climax of man's
dream to conquer the air...</i>

03:20.033 --> 03:22.252
<i>the new queen of the skies.</i>

06:45.655 --> 06:49.810
The embassy received hundreds of letters
like that last year, Mr. Ambassador.

06:49.910 --> 06:54.481
Mostly from cranks.
We can expect many more this season.

06:54.581 --> 06:58.235
Mrs. Rauch's letter is different.
It's specific.

06:58.335 --> 07:02.364
She spells out how and where
the zeppelin will be destroyed.

07:02.464 --> 07:05.809
A time bomb over American territory.

07:59.062 --> 08:01.064
- Franz.
- Erwin.

08:01.690 --> 08:03.633
Showing us how you do it in Spain?

08:03.733 --> 08:06.094
I'm afraid I don't fly very much there.

08:06.194 --> 08:08.179
Good to have you back, Franz.

08:08.279 --> 08:11.433
We hear they're giving you
a Knight's Cross to your Iron Cross.

08:11.533 --> 08:14.227
For writing up dossiers, I suppose.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.354
Half the time on our own people.

08:16.454 --> 08:18.940
They're turning us
into a Gestapo, Erwin.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.985
Get me out of Intelligence.
Get me back my Reconnaissance command.

08:22.085 --> 08:24.154
That might not be easy, Franz.

08:24.254 --> 08:26.656
Why not? All you have to do
is sign the order.

08:26.756 --> 08:30.386
You've been brought back for
a special problem which we've inherited.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.504
We've had our suspicions, Colonel...

08:41.604 --> 08:47.135
and now that letter confirms there is a plot
to sabotage the LZ 129 on this flight.

08:47.235 --> 08:50.889
Obviously, Dr. Goebbels, the sane thing
to do is to cancel the flight...

08:50.989 --> 08:53.266
until the Gestapo uncovers the plot.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.768
Sane but weak.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.562
The propaganda value of the LZ 129
is highly important.

08:57.662 --> 09:00.815
From a military standpoint,
she's a flying dinosaur.

09:00.915 --> 09:05.111
Colonel, the LZ 129
is a world symbol of Nazi power.

09:05.211 --> 09:08.990
It is an honor to guard her safety,
and you've been chosen.

09:09.090 --> 09:13.453
My field is the estimation of enemy
air operations, it's not espionage.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.081
A zeppelin ride should be
a vacation compared to Spain.

09:16.181 --> 09:19.084
You're being loaned to the LZ 129...

09:19.184 --> 09:21.670
as the officer in charge
of security for this trip.

09:21.770 --> 09:24.172
You will have the power to do
anything you think necessary...

09:24.272 --> 09:26.675
but quietly and discreetly...

09:26.775 --> 09:28.927
or it might appear
we have internal opposition.

09:29.027 --> 09:32.514
Ah. And you're afraid it might
strengthen the resistance movement.

09:32.614 --> 09:36.164
There is no
resistance movement, Colonel.

09:36.785 --> 09:41.006
That's reassuring coming
from the Minister of Propaganda.

09:44.459 --> 09:47.554
I mustn't keep you
from your next appointment.

09:49.839 --> 09:54.828
Let us hope that you will change
your opinion of our "flying dinosaur."

09:54.928 --> 09:59.183
Perhaps I will, unless there's
an egg hatching in her.

10:09.526 --> 10:12.387
The Hindenburg is scheduled
to leave in two days, Colonel.

10:12.487 --> 10:14.931
Why did the Gestapo
wait till now to show us this?

10:15.031 --> 10:18.476
It's inexcusable that our passengers have
to make other travel arrangements this late.

10:18.576 --> 10:22.547
- The flight hasn't been canceled.
- Not canceled? I thought...

10:23.456 --> 10:25.734
- Why are you here?
- I'll be aboard.

10:25.834 --> 10:27.527
A sort of special security officer.

10:27.627 --> 10:31.239
I'd like you along, Captain Lehmann,
as senior airship observer.

10:31.339 --> 10:35.014
You may have to work with the Gestapo,
Colonel, but I don't.

10:35.552 --> 10:38.038
You built the Hindenburg, Dr. Eckener.
Don't you want to protect your interests?

10:38.138 --> 10:42.000
I've protected them for 40 years
by taking no risks.

10:42.100 --> 10:45.003
Even if I wanted to go,
you'd never be able to clear it.

10:45.103 --> 10:47.881
Dr. Eckener and I are out of favor
at the chancellery.

10:47.981 --> 10:52.010
I refused to name the
Hindenburg after the Fuhrer.

10:52.110 --> 10:55.305
Captain Pruss, the new commander,
is an excellent airshipman.

10:55.405 --> 10:56.681
We trained him.

10:56.781 --> 10:59.267
Don't embarrass yourself
by requesting me, Colonel.

10:59.367 --> 11:02.854
They won't allow it,
and I prefer to leave it that way.

11:02.954 --> 11:06.584
It's all arranged.
I'll see you at the airfield Monday.

11:14.382 --> 11:17.352
Give me a break. Give me a break.

11:23.099 --> 11:27.128
These stupid S.S. men crawling
through our ship morning till night...

11:27.228 --> 11:28.838
with dirt on their shoes.

11:28.938 --> 11:32.842
If we hid an elephant in the lounge,
they couldn't find it.

11:32.942 --> 11:35.365
They weren't looking for an elephant.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.098
Did you see Karl
when the S.S. dog barked?

11:38.198 --> 11:41.793
He jumped ten feet, and the dog
bit him in the brains... here!

11:43.119 --> 11:45.918
Better than being bitten by the S.S.

11:52.629 --> 11:55.428
You should've refused
to go on that whale.

11:56.466 --> 11:58.701
The crew might think I'm a Jonah.

11:58.801 --> 12:03.665
I can't bear it.
Alfred, then Spain, now this.

12:03.765 --> 12:06.000
We aren't far from Switzerland, Franz.

12:06.100 --> 12:09.087
- I was walking along the river today and...
- No.

12:09.187 --> 12:11.798
But you hate what you're doing now.

12:11.898 --> 12:14.259
What would you have me
tell them in Switzerland?

12:14.359 --> 12:17.762
That yesterday I was a colonel
in the German Air Force?

12:17.862 --> 12:22.725
No. It'd be different if we were
Jews or pacifists, or even Communists.

12:22.825 --> 12:25.770
- Uncle Gustaf is in Geneva.
- I can't.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.838
I'd be a deserter.

12:29.040 --> 12:32.152
Listen to me, Eleanore.
I spoke to Erwin.

12:32.252 --> 12:35.321
He says he'll try to
get my old group back.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.890
We could live in the south,
far from Berlin.

12:38.424 --> 12:40.176
Poor Franz.

12:43.513 --> 12:49.486
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten!

12:50.186 --> 12:51.813
The winner!

12:54.232 --> 12:56.426
You'll be drunk, Karl!

12:56.526 --> 12:59.200
We'll be dry for two days
on board, woman.

13:00.071 --> 13:03.450
Please, Karl. Not tonight.

13:06.619 --> 13:11.733
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!

13:11.833 --> 13:14.712
Behave yourselves. You act like Gypsies.

13:20.300 --> 13:23.053
Good night. Good night.

13:23.594 --> 13:25.813
Stewardess, we're going to bed.

13:26.347 --> 13:28.725
We'll ring if we need anything.

13:35.106 --> 13:37.717
Excuse me. Excuse me. I beg your pardon.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.865
I'm just a poor Gypsy.

13:43.072 --> 13:45.642
That Freda Halle.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.644
She's a loose woman.

13:47.744 --> 13:51.606
They say she works for foreigners.
Some French bank in Frankfurt.

13:51.706 --> 13:53.233
We should report it, Frau Knorr.

13:53.333 --> 13:57.528
Look, it's women's gossip.
I mean, we're all loyal Germans.

13:57.628 --> 14:01.474
Besides, that Karl is no fool.
Enough now.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.953
I drink to the one I love.

14:05.053 --> 14:07.226
The Hindenburg.

14:28.284 --> 14:31.037
That song is going to make me sick.

15:14.330 --> 15:17.925
Charlie! Yoo-hoo! We're over here!

15:25.508 --> 15:29.746
It has wrecked more men,
blasted more lives...

15:29.846 --> 15:32.623
and dishonored more ladies...

15:32.723 --> 15:35.772
than any other scourge on this earth.

15:36.519 --> 15:40.256
I wish you'd forget this zeppelin crap
and come on over to the coronation.

15:40.356 --> 15:43.259
Quaky's rented a duke's palace
outside London.

15:43.359 --> 15:46.346
Not for us, Hattie.
Reed's finished the score on his new show.

15:46.446 --> 15:49.349
- Rehearsals start the 12th.
- We couldn't possibly.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.268
Besides, British quarantine
won't let Heidi into the country.

15:52.368 --> 15:54.354
You should've had children
instead of dogs.

15:54.454 --> 15:58.149
The evil spell's been lifted.
Bess is pregnant.

15:58.249 --> 16:00.297
At your age?

16:01.461 --> 16:05.239
- Finally.
- No rooftop announcements just yet. We...

16:05.339 --> 16:07.116
We don't want to push our luck.

16:07.216 --> 16:09.685
- Oh, Bess.
- Isn't it wonderful?

16:14.807 --> 16:16.793
How long will you be
away from us, Countess?

16:16.893 --> 16:19.420
I suppose until I get homesick.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.506
What is the purpose of your trip?

16:21.606 --> 16:26.260
- To visit my daughter at school in Boston.
- Where will you be staying?

16:26.360 --> 16:29.222
With friends.
Mr. and Mrs. Alden Winthrop.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.915
In Boston?

16:31.407 --> 16:34.185
Yes. And at their place on Cape Cod.

16:34.285 --> 16:36.208
What does he do?

16:36.913 --> 16:39.148
His occupation.

16:39.248 --> 16:41.192
He's with the Winthrop
First National Bank...

16:41.292 --> 16:44.637
and I can assure you, Major,
he is not the doorman.

16:46.923 --> 16:48.616
Estelle, I've been looking
all over for you.

16:48.716 --> 16:52.328
Mr. Edward Douglas.
Cablegram for Mr. Douglas...

16:52.428 --> 16:55.415
- I'm Mr. Douglas.
- Here, sir.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.062
Thank you.

16:59.769 --> 17:04.900
Will Mr. Kenji Shimura
please come to the information desk.

17:06.817 --> 17:11.806
Mr. Kenji Shimura,
please come to the information desk.

17:11.906 --> 17:14.308
Looks like we'll get off a little late.

17:14.407 --> 17:16.786
Yeah. What's the holdup?

17:17.994 --> 17:20.815
- Let's get this show on the road.
- I know I had it.

17:20.915 --> 17:24.152
We're keeping all passports
this trip, Countess.

17:24.252 --> 17:27.320
They will be returned to you
when we arrive at Lakehurst.

17:27.421 --> 17:29.139
Oh. I see.

17:29.799 --> 17:33.269
Your lighter will be returned
after we've landed at Lakehurst.

17:34.136 --> 17:36.080
The official photographer
should know better.

17:36.180 --> 17:38.749
If you'll just step into the booth
for a body search.

17:38.849 --> 17:40.692
It's company policy.

17:41.352 --> 17:43.629
- Stay up here with me.
- Stay together.

17:43.729 --> 17:47.175
Oh, Paul. So clumsy.

17:47.275 --> 17:49.403
- Help Daddy.
- Thank you.

17:50.152 --> 17:52.138
Your name is familiar, Mr. Breslau.

17:52.238 --> 17:53.973
Do you have relatives in Germany?

17:54.073 --> 17:56.809
Many friends and associates,
but no relatives.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.811
Well, now, you might have, Albert.

17:58.911 --> 18:02.565
I've always been sure our name
once had a "von." Von Breslau.

18:02.665 --> 18:05.610
- That's Prussian nobility.
- That's where I've heard it.

18:05.710 --> 18:08.654
Too bad, Mildred. The "von" doesn't
count when you're born in the States.

18:08.754 --> 18:11.115
- We all were.
- Me too.

18:11.215 --> 18:13.075
Couple of cowboys, huh?

18:13.175 --> 18:16.037
Come on, boys. Stay together.
Watch where you're going.

18:16.137 --> 18:19.123
- Over here.
- That's a handsome cane, sir.

18:19.223 --> 18:20.374
May I see it?

18:20.474 --> 18:23.961
You wouldn't admire it so much
if you were crippled.

18:24.061 --> 18:25.796
I don't intend to be.

18:25.896 --> 18:29.050
Would you tape the end of Mr. Bajetta's cane
and return it to him, please?

18:29.150 --> 18:32.803
- Yes, sir.
- You must be the special security officer.

18:32.903 --> 18:34.430
It's a good thing too.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.724
You know this ruddy blimp
is filled with hydrogen?

18:36.824 --> 18:38.518
I'll make a note of that. Thank you.

18:38.618 --> 18:41.270
You call that dumb Dutchman
a security man?

18:41.370 --> 18:44.815
The tape is for your own safety, sir.
The steel tip could strike sparks.

18:44.915 --> 18:47.485
I'd expect more courtesy
on a cattle boat.

18:47.585 --> 18:51.010
- Just do as you're told.
- May I help, Countess?

18:51.589 --> 18:53.057
Franz.

18:53.883 --> 18:55.952
- Are you on board?
- Yes.

18:56.052 --> 18:57.703
What's wrong this trip?

18:57.803 --> 19:00.498
These people insist upon going through
all of my luggage and my trunk.

19:00.598 --> 19:04.068
- Will you speak to them, please?
- Certainly.

19:07.229 --> 19:10.633
Search it. Strip the lining.
Remove the metal corners.

19:10.733 --> 19:14.783
If you run out of time,
ship it to the countess on the Bremen.

19:15.946 --> 19:19.016
Not very gallant, was it, Colonel?

19:19.116 --> 19:22.837
The German Air Force
is not at all what it used to be.

19:23.371 --> 19:25.439
But then nothing is these days.

19:25.539 --> 19:27.257
Nothing.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.593
Hi! Nice dog!

20:12.586 --> 20:14.634
Heil! Heil!

20:19.468 --> 20:20.936
No, no.

20:22.430 --> 20:24.524
Your papers, please.

20:26.517 --> 20:29.879
Introducing the world's greatest,
the one and only.

20:29.979 --> 20:33.883
Here's my passport and ticket.
All in order.

20:33.983 --> 20:36.827
Throw the bag on the zep, my boy.

20:46.746 --> 20:49.590
Oh, goody. We are going to play doctor.

20:50.374 --> 20:51.796
Why not?

20:52.376 --> 20:55.446
Give it a thorough examination.
Also the suitcase.

20:55.546 --> 20:58.449
Will Miss Breslau please write down
her correct weight?

20:58.549 --> 21:00.368
- I did. 106.
- Keep the pen.

21:00.468 --> 21:02.328
It's a present
from relatives in Germany.

21:02.428 --> 21:05.206
Not a word to your father until
after you've sailed. He'll understand.

21:05.306 --> 21:08.355
We don't have any relatives in Germany.

21:32.833 --> 21:34.735
My God, Lehmann.

21:34.835 --> 21:37.488
- Are you suggesting I disobey orders?
- No, Pruss.

21:37.588 --> 21:40.491
I'm saying the captain
has the authority to cancel a flight...

21:40.591 --> 21:42.535
any time he doesn't think it's safe.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.787
- You know our situation.
- I know that I don't believe much of it.

21:44.887 --> 21:47.790
If you say there's a weakness
on the new wrist pin on engine four...

21:47.890 --> 21:50.751
you have a valid reason for not
taking off. I'll back you up on it.

21:50.851 --> 21:52.336
Number four is perfectly reliable now.

21:52.436 --> 21:55.506
The rest of your ship may not be.

21:55.606 --> 21:58.092
No. It's out of the question, Lehmann.

21:58.192 --> 22:00.261
The ship was searched twice today.

22:00.361 --> 22:02.722
At least two Gestapo men
on board that I know of.

22:02.822 --> 22:04.974
And we have Colonel Ritter with us.

22:05.074 --> 22:07.476
I'd look like a fool, or worse. No.

22:07.576 --> 22:10.187
Oh, Ritter, come board with us.

22:10.287 --> 22:15.025
Colonel, did you know we have the pleasure
of Capt. Lehmann for this voyage?

22:15.125 --> 22:19.488
- Just as an observer, Captain.
- And as a diplomat.

22:19.588 --> 22:21.991
A worried diplomat.

22:22.091 --> 22:25.453
Seems I'm to go to Washington
to try to get us helium.

22:25.553 --> 22:27.476
I wish we had it this trip.

23:02.715 --> 23:05.844
To the right, please, Countess.
Excuse us, sir.

23:07.303 --> 23:08.829
We'd like to look around a bit first.

23:08.929 --> 23:11.398
Yes, ma'am.
I'll just put these in your cabin.

23:18.314 --> 23:21.318
Come on. Let's go look in here.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.826
I had no idea.

23:41.795 --> 23:45.157
This is my favorite room.
Now if we could get a drink...

23:45.257 --> 23:47.225
It has windows!

23:53.349 --> 23:56.819
Colonel Ritter,
your party has been contacted.

24:04.234 --> 24:06.554
- I had to see you again.
- Yes?

24:06.654 --> 24:10.079
I'll be back in six days.
Then we'll talk.

24:28.509 --> 24:30.432
Everything's in order, sir.

24:36.392 --> 24:39.145
Prepare to weigh off.

25:39.496 --> 25:41.498
- Bye now!
- Have fun!

25:45.961 --> 25:47.713
Drop lines.

25:50.299 --> 25:51.596
Up ship!

26:06.940 --> 26:10.945
Cable New York, Mitzi.
Remember, it's six hours different.

26:12.029 --> 26:13.656
Happy landing!

26:26.293 --> 26:27.987
Colonel Ritter.

26:28.087 --> 26:30.698
Martin Vogel. Did you know?
We're cabin mates.

26:30.798 --> 26:33.200
- Are we?
- Yes. I feel honored.

26:33.300 --> 26:35.661
I hope the colonel doesn't
mind sharing quarters with me.

26:35.761 --> 26:37.388
Delighted.

27:07.626 --> 27:09.111
Weather over the Channel.

27:09.211 --> 27:10.821
If you fly the north side
of the storm...

27:10.921 --> 27:13.240
the pressure pattern
will simply push us over England.

27:13.340 --> 27:15.200
The British don't want us
over their chimney pots.

27:15.300 --> 27:19.100
- They'll complain to the Foreign Office.
- Foreign Office isn't aboard.

27:19.721 --> 27:22.440
I'll do the worrying this trip, Captain.

27:22.933 --> 27:25.982
We'll stay on course
and try to outrun the storm.

27:57.467 --> 28:00.412
She's on her way, sir.
Left Frankfurt ten minutes ago.

28:00.512 --> 28:01.955
8:18 by their clock.

28:02.055 --> 28:04.208
- Now we sweat, Hank.
- Yes, sir.

28:04.308 --> 28:07.336
- Till 6:00 a.m. Thursday.
- Listen to this.

28:07.436 --> 28:11.673
"No voyager on the Hindenburg
need fear fire from within the ship."

28:11.773 --> 28:14.093
Et cetera, et cetera.

28:14.193 --> 28:18.305
That's the same magazine that predicted
Landon would beat Roosevelt in 32 states.

28:18.405 --> 28:21.558
That's why I read Ballyhoo
exclusively, sir.

28:21.658 --> 28:24.686
Every time she puts in here
it's like walking on a crate of eggs.

28:24.786 --> 28:27.460
A booby-trapped crate of eggs.

28:28.332 --> 28:31.485
Remember what happened the last time
we took the Los Angeles up?

28:31.585 --> 28:35.840
Yes, sir. If we hadn't had helium,
we wouldn't be here.

29:23.512 --> 29:25.685
Have you found it, Colonel?

29:27.224 --> 29:30.228
- Found what?
- There are no secrets on zeppelins.

29:32.020 --> 29:33.863
Let's hope not.

29:51.540 --> 29:54.610
- When do we eat?
- A light supper will be served at 10:00, sir.

29:54.710 --> 29:57.613
It's important that you put me
at Mr. Reed Channing's table.

29:57.713 --> 29:59.489
I've been checking on his dog.

29:59.589 --> 30:01.366
You should not have gone
back there, Mr. Spah.

30:01.466 --> 30:03.493
It's against regulations.

30:03.593 --> 30:05.561
So, don't say anything.

30:06.054 --> 30:08.182
Okay, comrade?

30:16.606 --> 30:21.828
Well, I still say the French line
has the best society.

30:22.362 --> 30:23.805
Daddy.

30:23.905 --> 30:26.850
There's something
I've been meaning to show you.

30:26.950 --> 30:28.477
A young man at the airfield
gave me this.

30:28.577 --> 30:30.270
- He told me...
- Where did you get that?

30:30.370 --> 30:33.214
- Daddy, I'm trying to tell you.
- Give it to me, dumpling.

30:33.832 --> 30:36.235
Valerie, your father's right.

30:36.335 --> 30:39.488
You shouldn't accept gifts
from strange men.

30:39.588 --> 30:42.057
- Mother!
- Enough.

30:42.632 --> 30:45.035
She's a pretty little thing.

30:45.135 --> 30:47.079
Only 4,000 miles to go.
I'd better meet her.

30:47.179 --> 30:49.915
- Four thousand, one hundred.
- Excuse me?

30:50.015 --> 30:55.192
- We've got 4,100 miles to go.
- Right.

30:56.772 --> 30:58.774
Ah, Holland.

31:01.276 --> 31:05.747
Nine minutes late.
Or do you make it ten, Mr. Douglas?

31:16.291 --> 31:17.964
Bring me a beer, please.

31:23.340 --> 31:26.118
When you are quite through,
may I, Mr. Bajetta?

31:26.218 --> 31:27.953
Only one damn lighter.

31:28.053 --> 31:30.289
Hell on cigar smokers.

31:30.389 --> 31:32.124
Filthy habit, cigars.

31:32.224 --> 31:34.192
Oh, no.

31:54.538 --> 31:56.336
Join me, Colonel?

31:56.873 --> 31:58.875
Göring adores it.

32:03.755 --> 32:06.325
But it's true, sir.
Right in there on the bar.

32:06.425 --> 32:09.286
The pen stood upright
for more than two hours.

32:09.386 --> 32:11.538
That's how steady the Hindenburg flies.

32:11.638 --> 32:15.667
Let's have a go at it ourselves,
shall we? Who has a pen?

32:15.767 --> 32:17.485
Do you mind, old boy?

32:18.270 --> 32:22.992
- Uh, yes, I need my pen.
- Not for a few minutes, surely. Come along.

32:24.776 --> 32:27.429
Fifty quid the bally pen
will be toppled in less than an hour.

32:27.529 --> 32:30.307
- Really, this is nonsense.
- Leave it. Be a sport.

32:30.407 --> 32:32.684
- I'll take the bet.
- Righto. Anyone else?

32:32.784 --> 32:35.562
Howell! You'll defend the honor
of old Eli, won't you?

32:35.662 --> 32:37.814
- It's Harvard.
- A hundred did you say.

32:37.914 --> 32:39.816
Gentleman from Yale wagers $100.

32:39.916 --> 32:41.401
I didn't say that. I said it's...

32:41.501 --> 32:44.613
What would we bet, Colonel?
The honor of the Third Reich...

32:44.713 --> 32:48.700
- also hangs in the balance.
- On so thin a thread.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.286
Five hundred marks
it stands eight hours.

32:51.386 --> 32:53.288
I'll take that bet.

32:53.388 --> 32:55.332
Will you watch it
through the night with me?

32:55.432 --> 32:58.276
- I told you, I need my pen.
- Sorry. All bets are off.

33:13.074 --> 33:14.559
When they came to me,
I refused to do it.

33:14.659 --> 33:17.437
They brought it to my daughter,
but she didn't know what it was.

33:17.537 --> 33:20.690
- Neither did my wife.
- Are your relatives Jews?

33:20.790 --> 33:24.194
Damn you. Yes. My grandmother was a Jew.

33:24.294 --> 33:27.406
Look here, Colonel. I import a lot
of German surgical instruments.

33:27.506 --> 33:28.615
You can bet the manufacturers...

33:28.715 --> 33:30.826
won't be so sensitive about
my grandmother's background.

33:30.926 --> 33:32.994
Mrs. Milstein.

33:33.094 --> 33:34.562
Yes.

33:35.305 --> 33:39.000
They wanted me to sell the diamonds
so they could get out of Germany.

33:39.100 --> 33:40.919
Does their name
have to be a part of it now?

33:41.019 --> 33:43.630
You know what could happen to them.

33:43.730 --> 33:46.466
Just make sure that you declare
those to U.S. Customs.

33:46.566 --> 33:49.945
I'll keep the pen
for the Gestapo museum.

34:10.257 --> 34:11.074
It's all right.

34:11.174 --> 34:14.077
Oh, yeah, when I saw your dog,
it was doing fine.

34:14.177 --> 34:16.705
That was real kind, Joe.

34:16.804 --> 34:19.399
- Thank you, sugar.
- Oh, no, thank you. I never touch the stuff.

34:33.071 --> 34:36.349
Over here, Captain. See it?
A clearing in the storm.

34:36.449 --> 34:40.498
Alter course 30 degrees.
Head for that bright spot.

34:41.036 --> 34:43.148
Forward engine to half speed.

34:43.248 --> 34:45.317
We'll slow down in this turbulence.

34:45.417 --> 34:48.842
That's how your American friends
lost all their ships.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.870
I would like to be
in your new show, Mr. Channing.

34:56.969 --> 34:59.206
I'm working on this new act. A zep act.

34:59.306 --> 35:02.584
Real sophisticated.
Perfect for a show like yours.

35:02.684 --> 35:04.778
- Oh, my...
- It's all right. It's okay.

35:05.562 --> 35:09.066
Sugar, next time let's take the Titanic.

35:32.881 --> 35:35.200
That pen incident.

35:35.300 --> 35:38.099
It was obvious
what you were looking for.

35:39.638 --> 35:41.857
Obvious to me, at least.

35:43.975 --> 35:48.004
I knew he was the kind
for diamonds not bombs.

35:48.104 --> 35:50.757
I could have told you about Breslau.

35:50.857 --> 35:52.217
All the characteristics.

35:52.317 --> 35:55.136
Brachycephalic skull,
heavy lower jaw, skin...

35:55.236 --> 35:58.365
Breslau happens to be
just one-quarter Jewish.

36:00.992 --> 36:03.478
The world is mongrelized, Vogel.

36:03.578 --> 36:06.502
Only in Berlin is everyone so pure.

36:07.040 --> 36:11.570
Well, we have all shapes
of heads to choose from.

36:11.670 --> 36:14.014
Can your X-ray eyes see inside them?

36:15.382 --> 36:17.033
Major Napier, for one...

36:17.133 --> 36:21.746
who has no traceable income
but makes frequent trips on luxury liners.

36:21.846 --> 36:24.708
Good way to pick up information
from important people.

36:24.808 --> 36:26.418
Why suddenly the Hindenburg?

36:26.518 --> 36:29.546
His big earlobes make me
think he's a British spy.

36:29.646 --> 36:31.631
There's no need for sarcasm, Colonel.

36:31.731 --> 36:35.677
May I humbly suggest that
Mr. Edward Douglas also bears watching?

36:35.777 --> 36:37.679
So very afraid we'll arrive late.

36:37.779 --> 36:40.557
He's head of the foreign branch of
an advertising company in Berlin.

36:40.657 --> 36:42.767
Their big account is pharmaceuticals.

36:42.867 --> 36:46.855
But he collected information from German
plants that supply parts for the Hindenburg.

36:46.955 --> 36:49.357
America also prepares for war.

36:49.457 --> 36:51.401
He was naval intelligence
during the last one.

36:51.501 --> 36:53.820
Stayed abroad, went into advertising.

36:53.920 --> 36:56.781
But he's careful not to advertise
his business this trip.

36:56.881 --> 37:00.410
- Joe Spah is just the opposite.
- Spah's just a clown.

37:00.510 --> 37:02.829
A clown who canceled
a performance for the Fuhrer...

37:02.929 --> 37:04.414
just to be on this flight.

37:04.514 --> 37:07.959
Also spent a week in Moscow,
just to see the Russian circus, he says.

37:08.059 --> 37:10.420
Can't deny Spah
has an unfriendly attitude.

37:10.520 --> 37:14.049
A lot of people fail to
see all our lovable qualities.

37:14.149 --> 37:18.011
Which are well displayed in the countess.
How do you happen to know her?

37:18.111 --> 37:20.221
Her husband and I were members
of the same flying club...

37:20.321 --> 37:21.723
in the days before the Luftwaffe.

37:21.823 --> 37:24.768
He was killed in a crash.
She went back to her estate.

37:24.868 --> 37:27.562
I hadn't seen her in years.
A rich widow with an estate.

37:27.662 --> 37:31.483
Yes, she's from a very
distinguished North Baltic family.

37:31.583 --> 37:33.526
Von Reugen from Peenemunde.

37:33.626 --> 37:36.279
Peenemunde? At the mouth of the Oder?

37:36.379 --> 37:39.574
- Owns half the island.
- Not anymore.

37:39.674 --> 37:42.410
Peenemunde's just been taken over
by weapons research.

37:42.510 --> 37:44.120
Big new development in rockets.

37:44.220 --> 37:47.165
If she knows what's going on there,
it's risky letting her out of the country.

37:47.265 --> 37:51.169
It's risky for the ship's photographer
to step out of line with the countess.

37:51.269 --> 37:55.423
If I were you, I'd find out how much
she knows before I let her off this ship.

37:55.523 --> 37:58.093
Leave that to me.
You stay away from her.

37:58.193 --> 38:01.346
Tomorrow this photographer
might take some pictures of the crew...

38:01.446 --> 38:03.390
find out what the common people
are thinking.

38:03.490 --> 38:05.725
They say the rigger, Karl Boerth...

38:05.825 --> 38:10.271
has a mistress who works in
the Frankfurt branch of a French bank.

38:10.371 --> 38:12.732
- Where did you hear that?
- I also hear she's been around.

38:12.832 --> 38:17.008
Boerth is not the first.
Her name is Freda Halle.

38:18.213 --> 38:21.741
I understand Boerth's a good man.
Hitler Youth leader.

38:21.841 --> 38:25.161
By the way, am I also a suspect?

38:25.261 --> 38:26.683
You?

38:27.263 --> 38:30.417
Why, you're my staunch ally.

38:30.517 --> 38:33.169
My teammate, my good right arm.

38:33.269 --> 38:34.316
The Gestapo.

38:36.356 --> 38:38.133
Ridiculous.
Where'd you get such an idea?

38:38.233 --> 38:41.219
Detailed information on everyone
except Martin Vogel.

38:41.319 --> 38:44.698
All it says here is
"Official Hindenburg photographer."

38:45.240 --> 38:48.476
Gestapo sources of information
are really excellent.

38:48.576 --> 38:50.228
Maybe not so good as you think.

38:50.328 --> 38:53.481
It fails to mention that Colonel Ritter
doesn't like Gestapo methods.

38:53.581 --> 38:55.817
Doesn't use them himself...

38:55.917 --> 38:59.421
and doesn't want you
operating behind his back.

39:00.255 --> 39:02.303
That's why we're cabin mates.

39:31.119 --> 39:33.021
I'm sorry, Dr. Luther.

39:33.121 --> 39:36.191
Captain Lehmann
is wasting his time coming here.

39:36.291 --> 39:39.319
Well, perhaps this at least
will persuade State...

39:39.419 --> 39:41.446
to make arrangements
for appointments for him.

39:41.546 --> 39:44.199
You know how Congress feels
about helium.

39:44.299 --> 39:47.929
They're afraid that Chancellor Hitler
will use it for military...

39:49.512 --> 39:51.289
What's been done about this?

39:51.389 --> 39:55.251
Everything possible to guarantee
the safety of the Hindenburg.

39:55.351 --> 39:58.880
The chief danger to her
is the American monopoly of helium.

39:58.980 --> 40:02.467
Now, if anything does happen,
Mr. Handford...

40:02.567 --> 40:05.662
it could be blamed on your country.

40:25.840 --> 40:28.284
Would you step outside
for a moment, Lessing, please?

40:28.384 --> 40:30.227
Certainly, Colonel.

40:32.513 --> 40:35.250
Get this off to Gestapo
Headquarters, Berlin.

40:35.350 --> 40:37.398
Attention: Hochwald.

40:38.978 --> 40:43.779
Send results
Freda Halle surveillance so far.

40:44.609 --> 40:48.580
Also run check on her lovers
before Boerth.

40:49.906 --> 40:53.142
Signed, Ritter.
Destroy that after it's sent.

40:53.242 --> 40:57.042
- Record the message by code number.
- Yes, sir.

41:02.085 --> 41:03.653
I don't like the dog so far away.

41:03.753 --> 41:06.281
- Suppose something happens.
- Impossible, Mr. Channing.

41:06.381 --> 41:09.826
Your dog is traveling first class.
Better than some of the passengers.

41:09.926 --> 41:12.554
- You see? She agrees.
- Kirsch.

41:15.515 --> 41:18.251
What are you doing bringing passengers
into the interior of the ship?

41:18.351 --> 41:22.088
Colonel, when we bought our tickets
we were told we could visit the dog.

41:22.188 --> 41:26.467
That may be, Mr. Channing,
but the ship's interior is now...

41:26.567 --> 41:28.761
no matter how much anyone tips.

41:28.861 --> 41:30.579
So, please.

41:31.698 --> 41:34.451
Damn it, I'm going to visit my dog.

41:36.160 --> 41:39.772
Passengers are barred
for their own safety.

41:39.872 --> 41:41.649
Take a look, Mr. Channing.

41:41.749 --> 41:45.094
If you fell, you'd go
right through, into the sea.

41:46.838 --> 41:47.947
Rot.

41:48.047 --> 41:51.284
Last year passengers were permitted
inside the hull, but not this voyage.

41:51.384 --> 41:55.163
Typical. You're running this ship
like a concentration camp.

41:55.263 --> 41:59.667
- I agree that I am running this ship.
- Go to hell.

41:59.767 --> 42:02.629
I take it back. That would be
a lot better than Germany is today.

42:02.729 --> 42:07.300
I'm curious as to why people like
yourselves would choose the Hindenburg.

42:07.400 --> 42:10.511
If you must know,
only because my wife is...

42:10.611 --> 42:12.454
Well, she...

42:13.114 --> 42:15.099
she gets sick on boats.

42:15.199 --> 42:17.852
The Zeppelin Company couldn't ask
for a better recommendation.

42:17.952 --> 42:20.104
I'll assign the cabin boy
to visit your dog every watch...

42:20.204 --> 42:21.814
and report to you. Fair enough?

42:21.914 --> 42:24.567
Why don't we talk about
the arrangements for your concert.

42:24.667 --> 42:26.319
Do you really think
I'm going to go through with that?

42:26.419 --> 42:29.844
I announced the concert.
I'm sure you won't disappoint us.

42:30.757 --> 42:33.284
Okay. You're the captain.

42:33.384 --> 42:37.184
You want a concert,
I'll give you a concert.

42:45.146 --> 42:47.298
Take her down below the fog layer, Hans.

42:47.398 --> 42:49.696
But no lower than 200 meters.

43:09.545 --> 43:12.139
By all means, come right in, Franz.

43:12.882 --> 43:14.450
Where did you get the lighter?

43:14.550 --> 43:17.349
Our radio operator is hot-blooded.

43:17.887 --> 43:19.981
Give it to me, Countess.

43:21.390 --> 43:23.209
Behave, Ursula. You know it's dangerous.

43:23.309 --> 43:28.006
Franz, I've learned a new game:
breaking all the rules.

43:28.106 --> 43:29.674
It's much more fun for people like us...

43:29.774 --> 43:33.219
than those shoe clerks and butchers
in their brown shirts...

43:33.319 --> 43:35.471
because, my darling, we made the rules.

43:35.571 --> 43:37.539
I made this one.

43:40.535 --> 43:42.937
Go ahead. Take it.
Help yourself to anything else.

43:43.037 --> 43:45.565
That's the official policy now,
isn't it?

43:45.665 --> 43:48.818
- They've taken my house and my land.
- So I heard.

43:48.918 --> 43:52.989
- How generous of you.
- Generous? I screamed bloody murder.

43:53.089 --> 43:56.242
Oh, Franz, if I told you what was
going on in Peenemunde...

43:56.342 --> 43:59.203
You don't know. No one knows.

43:59.303 --> 44:02.665
If they thought you knew, you would
never be allowed out of the country.

44:02.765 --> 44:05.985
Listen to me.
No questions asked or answered.

44:06.769 --> 44:11.007
You have made a great sacrifice
for the Fatherland.

44:11.107 --> 44:13.030
Do you understand me?

44:14.986 --> 44:16.345
Good.

44:16.445 --> 44:19.599
Why anyone would want
that wretched island I'll never know.

44:19.699 --> 44:22.226
Did I tell you, Franz,
I managed to get rid of it?

44:22.326 --> 44:23.873
Trudi will be delighted.

44:27.707 --> 44:30.985
Oh, Franz, she's growing up so nicely.

44:31.085 --> 44:33.821
She'll be at the airfield.
Perhaps you'll see her.

44:33.921 --> 44:35.448
Beautiful child.

44:35.548 --> 44:38.159
I heard you say she was going
to school in Boston. That's marvelous.

44:38.259 --> 44:40.387
And doing very well.

44:40.970 --> 44:44.144
It's the best school
for the deaf, I'm told.

44:45.808 --> 44:49.420
She's learning to speak and lip-read.

44:49.520 --> 44:51.864
Maybe this summer we'll...

45:06.954 --> 45:09.565
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Where are you?

45:09.665 --> 45:11.901
What is this? What is all that?

45:12.001 --> 45:14.049
It's atmospheric pressure.

45:19.759 --> 45:23.809
Yes! Stuart, I want my things
out of the safe.

45:29.518 --> 45:31.712
It's making me choke.

45:31.812 --> 45:34.531
What is this? What is all this?

45:44.951 --> 45:46.936
Oh, thank God, it's going away.

45:47.036 --> 45:50.189
Please, please, don't, uh...
don't be upset.

45:50.289 --> 45:54.318
You've just been treated
to a harmless display of St. Elmo's fire.

45:54.418 --> 45:57.446
- What's that?
- As the ship came through the fog...

45:57.546 --> 45:59.699
we accumulated an electrical charge...

45:59.799 --> 46:03.286
like a child shuffling his shoes
across a carpet.

46:03.386 --> 46:04.996
We've been in no danger.

46:05.096 --> 46:07.206
The ship is completely
bonded together...

46:07.306 --> 46:10.776
and the charge
was dissipated harmlessly.

46:11.394 --> 46:12.879
- Thank you.
- I was pretty sure...

46:12.979 --> 46:15.607
it was St. Elmo's fire all along.

46:16.440 --> 46:18.759
Personally, I could use
a little shot of something.

46:18.859 --> 46:21.908
Marvelous sensation on an airship.

46:22.405 --> 46:24.265
Floating.

46:24.365 --> 46:26.208
Timeless.

46:26.909 --> 46:31.022
Past, present, no difference.

46:31.122 --> 46:33.875
They all seem to run together here.

46:34.542 --> 46:37.011
Don't you find it so, Franz?

46:43.426 --> 46:46.787
- Do you still play cards, Countess?
- Why?

46:46.887 --> 46:52.144
Major Napier and Mr. Bajetta
pique my professional curiosity.

46:52.727 --> 46:54.837
I've been propositioned frequently...

46:54.937 --> 46:58.716
but this is the first time I've ever
been recruited by the German Luftwaffe.

46:58.816 --> 47:01.052
That is what you're doing,
isn't it, Franz?

47:01.152 --> 47:03.429
Yes. With apologies.

47:03.529 --> 47:06.265
I'll give you
ten percent of my winnings.

47:06.365 --> 47:10.269
You probably remember,
I'm good at games of chance.

47:10.369 --> 47:12.417
You're in the right place.

47:13.748 --> 47:16.376
Well, that's an odd thing to say.

47:19.378 --> 47:22.848
It's obviously some kind
of private code.

47:23.466 --> 47:26.202
In any case, we'll see the answer
before Douglas does.

47:26.302 --> 47:29.163
- That gives us an advantage.
- True.

47:29.263 --> 47:31.265
Go ahead and send it.

48:42.670 --> 48:45.865
Spah made this sketch
of the ship's interior.

48:45.965 --> 48:49.595
- See if you can open this.
- Standard combination.

48:52.972 --> 48:55.416
Now what do you think of your pet clown?

48:55.516 --> 48:58.110
I think we better
watch him more closely.

49:03.107 --> 49:05.701
Simple for a man who knows his job.

49:08.988 --> 49:12.016
Douglas got rid of
that airport telegram very quickly.

49:12.116 --> 49:15.353
We'll have to wait
for the answer to the one he sent.

49:15.453 --> 49:17.646
How long is this concert
supposed to last?

49:17.746 --> 49:22.422
No telling. However, I asked
the captain to arrive 15 minutes late.

49:26.839 --> 49:28.887
A coding device.

49:30.009 --> 49:32.432
I've never seen one quite like it.

49:34.221 --> 49:38.977
Luftwaffe Intelligence has been
too busy sunning themselves in Spain.

49:40.936 --> 49:44.590
"Operation 'K'." What do you suppose
that stands for, Vogel?

49:44.690 --> 49:47.785
"Kraut"? "Knockwurst"? "Kosher"?

49:50.571 --> 49:53.182
What more do you need
to question Napier and Pajetta?

49:53.282 --> 49:55.910
My orders are to move quietly.

49:56.702 --> 50:01.023
Besides, when you surface
a spy, and he doesn't know it...

50:01.123 --> 50:03.125
you can turn him to your own advantage.

50:32.404 --> 50:34.640
With your permission, Captain...

50:34.740 --> 50:37.435
I would like to play
for the first time in public...

50:37.535 --> 50:40.187
a little number from my upcoming show...

50:40.287 --> 50:45.509
and Mr. Joe Spah has kindly agreed
to take part in this little entertainment.

50:48.754 --> 50:51.507
I hope you like it. Captain.

50:52.424 --> 50:54.552
- Mr. Spah.
- Mr. Channing.

52:23.515 --> 52:25.859
- Danke schön.
- De nada.

53:31.458 --> 53:33.569
Thank you so much, Mr. Channing.

53:33.669 --> 53:36.798
Unfortunately, your humor
is not the same as ours.

53:37.881 --> 53:39.849
Good night, sir.

53:54.398 --> 53:56.651
It was really surprising.

56:07.239 --> 56:10.601
Oh, it's you, Boerth.
What the devil were you doing up there?

56:10.701 --> 56:13.937
- Routine inspection, Colonel.
- Inspecting what?

56:14.037 --> 56:17.507
Control cables, sir. A rigger's duty.

56:19.167 --> 56:22.011
Is there anything
I can help you with, sir?

56:22.588 --> 56:25.324
I understand you were
a Hitler Youth leader.

56:25.424 --> 56:26.533
Yes, sir.

56:26.633 --> 56:28.702
But you haven't been active
for the last two years.

56:28.802 --> 56:31.997
Only because of the Hindenburg, sir.

56:32.097 --> 56:34.041
I helped build her in Friedrichshafen...

56:34.141 --> 56:36.894
and last year I made all ten trips.

56:37.853 --> 56:41.448
If there's nothing else, sir,
I'll get on with my duties.

56:50.741 --> 56:51.788
Boerth!

56:56.079 --> 56:58.315
I wonder what you
were really doing, Boerth.

56:58.415 --> 57:00.543
MY duty, sir.

57:43.961 --> 57:47.322
We're from the F.B.I., Mrs. Rauch.
We'd like to talk to you.

57:47.422 --> 57:50.325
G-men? Oh, Lordy, Lordy!

57:50.425 --> 57:53.679
- You sure you got the right party?
- Yes, ma'am.

57:54.346 --> 57:55.998
But...

57:56.098 --> 57:59.042
Then you confirm that
that is your letter...

57:59.142 --> 58:01.253
in your own handwriting,
to the German ambassador?

58:01.353 --> 58:05.465
I certainly do, and everything in it
will happen just like I say.

58:05.565 --> 58:10.262
Tomorrow the zeppelin will fly
over New York City and blow up.

58:10.362 --> 58:12.848
- I know it for a fact.
- How, Mrs. Rauch?

58:12.948 --> 58:17.269
Because two weeks ago I saw it
in a vision, clear as crystal.

58:17.369 --> 58:20.188
I'm clairvoyant, and I'm never wrong.

58:20.288 --> 58:22.837
Just ask any of the neighbors.

58:23.917 --> 58:26.111
I also predict that Bette Davis...

58:26.211 --> 58:28.530
will play the part
of Scarlett O'Hara in the movie...

58:28.630 --> 58:32.931
and the Duke of Windsor
will never marry Mrs. Simpson.

58:46.606 --> 58:48.383
Read it from the shorthand.

58:48.483 --> 58:51.219
"Checking information
that former lover of Freda Halle...

58:51.319 --> 58:54.806
was killed fighting for Leftists in Spain.
Signed, Hochwald."

58:54.906 --> 58:56.767
To Hochwald.

58:56.867 --> 59:02.940
Is there any information
regarding bomb from Halle?

59:03.040 --> 59:08.092
Have several suspects,
but I need evidence. Ritter.

59:12.507 --> 59:15.681
Magnificent. Icebergs!

59:17.179 --> 59:20.916
They're too far away to photograph.
Will you turn around?

59:21.016 --> 59:24.395
- I never dreamed we'd see icebergs.
- That's interesting.

59:30.358 --> 59:33.929
Where've you been, George?
Look at the icebergs.

59:34.029 --> 59:37.704
Makes you feel like
an explorer flying over the pole.

59:45.415 --> 59:47.543
You still play beautifully.

59:48.835 --> 59:51.905
Only I wish you were playing cards.

59:52.005 --> 59:54.178
3:00 this afternoon.

01:00:06.394 --> 01:00:09.673
You won't say anything about me
bringing her down here, will you?

01:00:09.773 --> 01:00:12.572
Oh, hell, I've been
doing it since we left.

01:00:13.485 --> 01:00:16.638
- What kind of dog is she?
- She's a dalmatian.

01:00:16.738 --> 01:00:19.641
She used to follow behind carriages,
didn't you, girl?

01:00:19.741 --> 01:00:21.914
She needs a lot of exercise.

01:00:55.986 --> 01:00:59.681
- Cover on port fin ripped loose, sir.
- Engines three and four, idle.

01:00:59.781 --> 01:01:01.808
Forward engines to quarter speed.

01:01:01.908 --> 01:01:04.127
- Suppose I go aft and take a look.
- Go ahead.

01:01:20.677 --> 01:01:23.100
Right. Yes. Right.

01:01:24.306 --> 01:01:28.043
- Hold her into the wind.
- Captain, we're losing altitude.

01:01:28.143 --> 01:01:31.296
- We're heavy. Picked up rain in the squall.
- More power, sir?

01:01:31.396 --> 01:01:34.616
No. The riggers would be swept
overboard by the wind.

01:01:36.818 --> 01:01:40.347
- What's the altitude now?
- Three hundred fifty meters, sir.

01:01:40.447 --> 01:01:43.892
- Rate of descent?
- Ten meters a minute.

01:01:43.992 --> 01:01:47.496
That gives them about, uh... 25 minutes.

01:02:04.804 --> 01:02:06.556
- Hold him!
- Got him!

01:02:09.851 --> 01:02:11.878
Foot on the bar! On the bar!

01:02:11.978 --> 01:02:14.089
- Lift him up!
- Put your feet down here.

01:02:14.189 --> 01:02:16.591
- All right. Hold him.
- Put me down on the girder.

01:02:16.691 --> 01:02:18.193
Damn!

01:02:19.444 --> 01:02:21.867
Jesus! Looks bad.

01:02:23.823 --> 01:02:25.791
It's all right. Let's go.

01:02:44.844 --> 01:02:47.563
Altitude: 280 meters.

01:02:49.516 --> 01:02:51.063
Can't risk going below 100.

01:03:04.906 --> 01:03:06.933
Altitude: 260 meters.

01:03:07.033 --> 01:03:09.206
Now losing 15 a minute.

01:03:10.328 --> 01:03:12.547
Forward engines to half.

01:03:14.833 --> 01:03:16.484
Little more breeze
won't blow them away, Oster.

01:03:16.584 --> 01:03:18.820
We'll gain some lift
in a couple of minutes.

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:21.093
Forward engines, half speed.

01:03:40.442 --> 01:03:43.321
You've only got about 15 minutes.

01:03:58.543 --> 01:04:00.762
You sew, Karl. You're faster.

01:04:13.767 --> 01:04:16.336
What exposure
are you using, Mr. Shimura?

01:04:16.436 --> 01:04:18.609
- Five-six.
- Five-six.

01:04:20.732 --> 01:04:23.235
Thank the Lord I brought this camera.

01:04:27.489 --> 01:04:29.808
Look, darling. It's gorgeous!

01:04:29.908 --> 01:04:31.559
- Stepped on the line.
- Did not!

01:04:31.659 --> 01:04:34.771
That's worth the whole trip.
It's breathtaking.

01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:37.482
It's all right to tell the captain
he can go on now.

01:04:37.582 --> 01:04:40.677
- We have all the pictures we want.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:56.310
- Go back inside. Look after your eye.
- Just finish up.

01:05:00.397 --> 01:05:05.244
Stand by, Dimmler. When we're down
to 100, I want all engines full speed.

01:05:08.530 --> 01:05:10.498
Get the riggers inside.

01:05:14.202 --> 01:05:15.579
Knorr! Boerth!

01:05:16.913 --> 01:05:18.915
No more time. Back inside.

01:05:21.376 --> 01:05:25.655
- It's still too big. It'll rip.
- Captain's orders! Back inside!

01:05:25.755 --> 01:05:27.257
Karl!

01:05:43.731 --> 01:05:46.092
One rigger's still outside, Captain.

01:05:46.192 --> 01:05:47.910
Boerth.

01:05:49.529 --> 01:05:53.750
- Captain. Boerth is still outside.
- I heard you, Dimmler.

01:06:15.555 --> 01:06:17.853
All engines full ahead.

01:06:19.392 --> 01:06:21.815
Nose up five degrees.

01:06:28.735 --> 01:06:31.158
Knorr? Knorr, I'm going off!

01:06:51.216 --> 01:06:52.388
Pull me!

01:07:09.567 --> 01:07:11.160
Pull me!

01:07:19.536 --> 01:07:21.163
You're all right, Karl. Come on.

01:08:03.288 --> 01:08:05.982
She's about seven hours late.

01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:09.177
I assure you, madame,
there's no need to worry.

01:08:10.503 --> 01:08:13.615
She's right there, 100 miles
off the coast of Newfoundland.

01:08:13.715 --> 01:08:17.785
Then they won't be landing
till tomorrow afternoon.

01:08:17.885 --> 01:08:20.205
I suggest you come back
tomorrow morning.

01:08:20.305 --> 01:08:22.808
We'll know much better by then.

01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:25.393
- Thank you so much.
- My pleasure.

01:09:09.395 --> 01:09:12.819
- Mr. Douglas.
- Oh. Thank you.

01:09:29.207 --> 01:09:31.317
I'll take that to the radio room
for you, Mr. Douglas.

01:09:31.417 --> 01:09:33.528
No, thank you. I'll do it myself.

01:09:33.627 --> 01:09:36.656
- But, sir, passengers aren't allowed to...
- I know, I know.

01:09:36.756 --> 01:09:39.975
Here's my special pass. Thank you.

01:10:03.908 --> 01:10:06.269
I'd like to see you, Mr. Douglas.

01:10:06.369 --> 01:10:08.062
How 'bout a drink later?

01:10:08.162 --> 01:10:09.505
Now!

01:10:11.290 --> 01:10:13.418
- What's this strong-arm stuff?
- Come on.

01:10:20.299 --> 01:10:22.994
You'd better tell me
about this, Mr. Douglas.

01:10:23.094 --> 01:10:26.581
While you're at it,
explain these, in code.

01:10:26.681 --> 01:10:31.061
I don't have to explain
a damn thing to you. Get out.

01:10:37.024 --> 01:10:39.802
Better set it back to Frankfurt time.

01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:42.597
That's where a fast police car
will be meeting you...

01:10:42.697 --> 01:10:46.873
in roughly 94 hours,
barring accidents, of course.

01:10:48.953 --> 01:10:52.482
Okay, I'll tell you, Ritter,
but you've gotta let me send that message.

01:10:52.582 --> 01:10:54.359
It may mean the difference.

01:10:54.459 --> 01:10:57.904
- To what?
- To pulling off the biggest deal of my life.

01:10:58.004 --> 01:11:00.531
Right now, I'm in a race.

01:11:00.631 --> 01:11:03.326
A race to beat my competitor
into New York.

01:11:03.426 --> 01:11:07.121
- Who?
- Fred Seemans, head of Seemans and Poelzig.

01:11:07.221 --> 01:11:09.540
At this moment,
he's on the Queen Mary...

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:11.959
which left a day and a half ahead of us.

01:11:12.059 --> 01:11:14.837
In the messages,
we call his outfit the Sharks...

01:11:14.937 --> 01:11:16.923
mine the Hawks.

01:11:17.023 --> 01:11:18.966
One by air and one by sea
and both carnivorous.

01:11:19.066 --> 01:11:21.302
You're beginning to get the idea.

01:11:21.402 --> 01:11:23.846
Tomorrow it'll be announced
that General Motors has acquired...

01:11:23.946 --> 01:11:25.932
the Opel Motor Company.

01:11:26.032 --> 01:11:28.142
The advertising account
will be up for grabs.

01:11:28.242 --> 01:11:31.246
Whoever gets there first
will have the jump.

01:11:31.788 --> 01:11:37.010
All right. Let's see if there's
a Fred Seemans on board the Queen Mary.

01:11:46.594 --> 01:11:47.971
Yeah?

01:11:51.599 --> 01:11:55.044
- Hi, Captain.
- Three hours. Where ya been, Baker?

01:11:55.144 --> 01:11:57.338
All ya had to do was phone
the steamship line.

01:11:57.438 --> 01:11:58.756
That was the easy part.

01:11:58.856 --> 01:12:02.927
"The individual, Frederick Seemans,
is on board the Queen Mary...

01:12:03.027 --> 01:12:07.557
occupying suite 312,
first class, 'C' deck."

01:12:07.657 --> 01:12:09.767
It's the others that took the time.

01:12:09.867 --> 01:12:14.939
Operation "K," Passage,
Raid and Mr. Chandu.

01:12:15.039 --> 01:12:16.399
You know who they are?

01:12:16.499 --> 01:12:19.277
You're gonna tell me
any day now, aren't ya, Baker?

01:12:19.377 --> 01:12:22.029
- They're horses, Captain.
- What?

01:12:22.129 --> 01:12:23.865
Well, you see, it had me stumped.

01:12:23.965 --> 01:12:27.618
So I contacted the F.B.I.,
and was my face red.

01:12:27.718 --> 01:12:30.204
These are the names of racehorses.

01:12:30.304 --> 01:12:34.250
Why does some German on a zeppelin
want us to find out about the ponies?

01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:36.085
You got me.

01:12:36.185 --> 01:12:39.505
Maybe he's heard:
New York cops make book.

01:12:39.605 --> 01:12:43.301
Maybe he thinks
he can and win himself a bundle.

01:12:43.401 --> 01:12:45.470
Well, that's near Lakehurst.

01:12:45.570 --> 01:12:47.263
Two of these nags are runnin' tomorrow.

01:12:47.363 --> 01:12:49.599
Operation "K" and Mr. Chandu.

01:12:49.699 --> 01:12:54.103
Well, send them the odds.
That's probably all the guy wants, anyway.

01:12:54.203 --> 01:12:55.921
Think so?

01:12:57.874 --> 01:13:01.424
Which two horses?
I need it for the record.

01:13:11.554 --> 01:13:13.022
Hi, Tommy.

01:13:13.681 --> 01:13:16.042
You boys are goin' out
to beautiful Jersey.

01:13:16.142 --> 01:13:17.960
Special request of the State Department.

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:21.839
This time they got a Luftwaffe
colonel aboard, name is Ritter.

01:13:21.939 --> 01:13:23.174
Big wheel with Intelligence.

01:13:23.274 --> 01:13:25.301
Comin' to land a couple
of espionage agents, maybe?

01:13:25.401 --> 01:13:28.554
Don't you experts let any
goddamn Nazis slip into the country.

01:13:28.654 --> 01:13:31.307
That blimp better not fly too low over
them Jersey woods.

01:13:31.407 --> 01:13:34.811
Full of moonshiners. They'll shoot any
big-ass bird flyin' over their stills.

01:13:34.911 --> 01:13:38.564
Yeah, the T-men are also sending
a special Customs squad.

01:13:38.664 --> 01:13:40.900
- Byrnes Duncan will be with them.
- Duncan?

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.194
He's with the Bureau of Explosives.

01:13:43.294 --> 01:13:45.738
Oh, thanks a lot.
Now we get the picture.

01:13:45.838 --> 01:13:47.636
That's right.

01:14:13.491 --> 01:14:16.085
It's very nice to see you again.

01:14:18.996 --> 01:14:20.919
Have you been playing long?

01:14:41.727 --> 01:14:44.839
Ah. I thought we might be able
to find time to relax...

01:14:44.939 --> 01:14:48.301
now that the famous Rauch letter
turns out to be from a crank.

01:14:48.401 --> 01:14:51.450
The Gestapo often exaggerates
their information.

01:14:52.238 --> 01:14:54.473
- Are you building this?
- Yes.

01:14:54.573 --> 01:14:57.101
It's my own design
for a house in Zeppelinheim...

01:14:57.201 --> 01:14:58.978
the new village near the airfield.

01:14:59.078 --> 01:15:01.272
We're hoping our airship families
will settle there.

01:15:01.372 --> 01:15:02.749
Come.

01:15:04.834 --> 01:15:07.303
- For you, Colonel.
- Thank you.

01:15:11.757 --> 01:15:14.702
It's from the Gestapo.
Boerth's woman has been arrested.

01:15:14.802 --> 01:15:16.704
She's confessed
that her ex-lover was killed...

01:15:16.804 --> 01:15:18.539
fighting for the Leftists in Spain.

01:15:18.639 --> 01:15:21.667
In the hands of the Gestapo,
anyone can be made to confess anything.

01:15:21.767 --> 01:15:26.672
Yes. In bed with his mistress,
Boerth could have been talked into a plot.

01:15:26.772 --> 01:15:28.090
What plot, Colonel?

01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:32.011
A crank letter has been made
into a matter of state.

01:15:32.111 --> 01:15:35.014
The purpose of exaggerating
the bomb scare was to get helium.

01:15:35.114 --> 01:15:38.267
- I went along with that.
- There are other sources of information.

01:15:38.367 --> 01:15:40.353
Perhaps no more valid than the letter.

01:15:40.453 --> 01:15:43.689
Well, I'm not a believer in the occult
like our Mrs. Rauch...

01:15:43.789 --> 01:15:49.216
but I'll tell you, Captain,
I have an uneasy sense of disaster.

01:15:50.588 --> 01:15:53.491
As if a bomb were ticking inside me.

01:15:53.591 --> 01:15:57.687
It's a constant feeling
with some people in Germany these days.

01:15:58.512 --> 01:16:00.623
A decent man like you, Colonel...

01:16:00.723 --> 01:16:03.626
with a wife, probably raising a family.

01:16:03.726 --> 01:16:06.545
Have you never had this feeling before?

01:16:06.645 --> 01:16:09.194
"Probably raising a family."

01:16:09.815 --> 01:16:14.428
My only son was killed three months ago
working for the new order.

01:16:14.528 --> 01:16:18.140
But believe me, Captain, I'm not
much better working for the Gestapo...

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:21.727
one of their spies
lying in bed above me.

01:16:21.827 --> 01:16:24.772
What's happening to people like us?

01:16:24.872 --> 01:16:27.441
I've given my life to zeppelins.

01:16:27.541 --> 01:16:29.235
Last year, for the sake
of our company...

01:16:29.335 --> 01:16:33.322
I even dropped political pamphlets
from this ship.

01:16:33.422 --> 01:16:35.516
Where does it stop?

01:16:36.258 --> 01:16:39.370
I've been in the air force
since the World War.

01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:40.955
When the Versailles Treaty
abolished it...

01:16:41.055 --> 01:16:43.916
I worked with Göring
and the others to build a secret one.

01:16:44.016 --> 01:16:46.961
I remember those days.
You people trained in gliders.

01:16:47.061 --> 01:16:49.797
Yes, all over Germany, mostly at night.

01:16:49.897 --> 01:16:54.653
I was proud when Hitler brought
the new Luftwaffe out into the open.

01:16:55.861 --> 01:16:58.556
I wasn't proud after last week.

01:16:58.656 --> 01:17:02.435
Guernica. A little Basque village.

01:17:02.535 --> 01:17:04.583
A few hundred peasants.

01:17:05.371 --> 01:17:08.065
We dropped 3,000 bombs on it.

01:17:08.165 --> 01:17:10.042
You were there?

01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:13.195
Chief of Intelligence.

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:17.450
So that's how one wins
the Knight's Cross in peacetime.

01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:19.348
"Peacetime."

01:17:21.512 --> 01:17:23.622
Well, now we have two heroes aboard.

01:17:23.722 --> 01:17:26.208
Boerth did valiant service
to the Hindenburg today.

01:17:26.308 --> 01:17:29.253
He doesn't seem to be the man
to destroy the ship.

01:17:29.353 --> 01:17:30.421
He does to me.

01:17:30.521 --> 01:17:34.759
He's exactly the kind of man I would choose
for a dangerous mission.

01:17:34.859 --> 01:17:37.887
Bold, tough, cool.

01:17:37.987 --> 01:17:40.723
You have those qualities
in common with him.

01:17:40.823 --> 01:17:42.951
You're both good men.

01:17:43.409 --> 01:17:45.787
I must get to know him better.

01:17:47.037 --> 01:17:51.817
Please show this to Pruss. Thank you
for the coffee, Captain. Good night.

01:17:51.917 --> 01:17:55.217
I, uh... hope you get your house built.

01:18:30.956 --> 01:18:33.526
Freda Halle has been arrested.

01:18:33.626 --> 01:18:35.594
Traffic violation?

01:18:36.170 --> 01:18:39.740
- No, by the Gestapo.
- Because she works for foreigners?

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:43.744
- Because I think she works with you.
- She lives with me.

01:18:43.844 --> 01:18:46.188
She's admitted that your...

01:18:47.806 --> 01:18:50.668
predecessor has been killed in Spain.

01:18:50.768 --> 01:18:53.337
- So?
- If she knows about the bomb...

01:18:53.437 --> 01:18:56.987
they'll make her confess that too.
Where is it, Boerth?

01:18:57.816 --> 01:19:00.886
They'll work on Freda until you tell me.

01:19:00.986 --> 01:19:02.012
You filth.

01:19:02.112 --> 01:19:05.850
No worse than the filth
who wants to blow up 97 people.

01:19:05.950 --> 01:19:07.810
But you won't have a chance,
because I'm locking you up.

01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:10.229
- You're under arrest. Let's go
- Ritter, get your hands off me.

01:19:10.329 --> 01:19:12.898
Get your hands off me,
or I'll blow it up now.

01:19:12.998 --> 01:19:15.526
You can't stop it.
I can make it go any second.

01:19:15.626 --> 01:19:19.221
Don't force me, Ritter.
I need you to help me.

01:19:34.228 --> 01:19:36.922
For Ritter. Get it to him immediately.

01:19:37.022 --> 01:19:39.800
He's hard to find.
Prowls all over the ship.

01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:44.597
Boerth, where is it?
The Gestapo knows about the bomb.

01:19:44.697 --> 01:19:48.100
This ship is the Nazis'
greatest propaganda weapon.

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:51.353
You patched her up today
for your own propaganda.

01:19:51.453 --> 01:19:53.939
No good if she simply
tumbled into the sea, hm?

01:19:54.039 --> 01:19:56.650
No politics in an act of God.

01:19:56.750 --> 01:20:00.196
No survivors either.
But that's not how I plan to do it.

01:20:00.296 --> 01:20:03.324
It'll happen at the mooring mast
at Lakehurst.

01:20:03.424 --> 01:20:07.328
A hydrogen airship?
That's deliberate murder.

01:20:07.428 --> 01:20:11.373
The Luftwaffe in Spain is deliberate murder,
and that's practice for Hitler.

01:20:11.473 --> 01:20:14.793
You people are going to save the world
by blowing up the Hindenburg.

01:20:14.893 --> 01:20:17.213
It's a place to start.

01:20:17.313 --> 01:20:19.632
It'll prove there is a resistance.

01:20:19.732 --> 01:20:22.092
Decent Germans
will get the courage to join us...

01:20:22.192 --> 01:20:25.596
and no one has to be killed
if you help me.

01:20:25.696 --> 01:20:28.074
You're the key to this...

01:20:30.534 --> 01:20:34.188
- Boerth, is that Col. Ritter with you?
- Coming.

01:20:34.288 --> 01:20:36.962
Colonel, a message for you.

01:21:28.842 --> 01:21:31.537
I have a date
with my little Jewish model.

01:21:31.637 --> 01:21:34.039
I'm curious to try one
before they're all gone.

01:21:34.139 --> 01:21:36.187
Cologne won't help you.

01:21:37.184 --> 01:21:40.421
Why didn't you arrest Boerth?
Pruss showed me the message.

01:21:40.521 --> 01:21:43.966
I'm still looking for a bomb. Arresting
Boerth won't keep it from going off.

01:21:44.066 --> 01:21:45.968
It will, damn it, if you make him talk.

01:21:46.068 --> 01:21:49.596
Your thumbscrews didn't make
Freda Halle talk about a bomb...

01:21:49.696 --> 01:21:51.640
before she was shot
while trying to escape.

01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:55.019
That was the mistake of a stupid guard.
You're making a worse one.

01:21:55.119 --> 01:21:58.814
- Arrest Boerth, Spah, Douglas, all of them.
- Brilliant, Vogel.

01:21:58.914 --> 01:22:01.066
The Hindenburg will come
into Lakehurst like a prison ship.

01:22:01.166 --> 01:22:04.737
I can see the headline.
"Anti-Nazi Plot on Zep."

01:22:04.837 --> 01:22:06.572
There are ways to keep it quiet.

01:22:06.672 --> 01:22:09.366
If it offends your delicacy,
I'll handle it for you.

01:22:09.466 --> 01:22:11.368
Do as you're told.
I'll take care of Boerth.

01:22:11.468 --> 01:22:15.581
You watch Napier and Spah and,
of course, your little model.

01:22:15.681 --> 01:22:19.902
- I'll also be watching you.
- Fine. Who'll be watching you?

01:22:21.603 --> 01:22:23.589
I'm really disappointed, Colonel.

01:22:23.689 --> 01:22:28.786
We thought after the splendid example of
your own son that you would personify...

01:23:36.428 --> 01:23:40.353
Gentlemen, new time
of arrival: 5:00 p.m.

01:23:41.433 --> 01:23:44.044
Now you reporters can go
back to the gin mills.

01:23:44.144 --> 01:23:47.714
I'll ask the police and
the security officers to stay on, though.

01:23:47.814 --> 01:23:49.800
All right, boys,
get 'em while they're hot.

01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:54.680
- Who needs a passenger list?
- I'll take one. Thanks.

01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:56.723
There's a real pair. Napier and Pajetta.

01:23:56.823 --> 01:23:59.393
- You know those men, Sergeant?
- Sure do.

01:23:59.493 --> 01:24:02.146
The Major and Emilio "The Cane."
They're boatmen.

01:24:02.246 --> 01:24:04.940
Uh, cardsharps.
Usually work the luxury liners.

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:06.400
Real characters.

01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:10.779
I'm supposed to check
the copper tubing on the airship, sir.

01:24:10.879 --> 01:24:13.866
Are those guys kidding about a bomb?

01:24:13.966 --> 01:24:15.434
That's very funny.

01:24:21.515 --> 01:24:23.917
- Hey, look!
- Yeah.

01:24:24.017 --> 01:24:28.630
Ah, yes. Rainbows like that
are very common in airship travel.

01:24:28.730 --> 01:24:30.507
Hey, Dad.

01:24:30.607 --> 01:24:32.759
- Did you see it?
- What?

01:24:32.859 --> 01:24:34.428
It's nothin', Dad.

01:24:34.528 --> 01:24:37.890
Rainbows like that
are very common in airship travel.

01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:40.539
- Oh, is that right?
- Yeah.

01:25:06.643 --> 01:25:09.213
- Are you with me?
- I have something to tell you.

01:25:09.313 --> 01:25:12.925
I have no time for you. The ship
and I have six and a half hours left.

01:25:13.025 --> 01:25:15.198
It concerns Freda Halle.

01:25:16.987 --> 01:25:21.242
- Gestapo?
- Killed while trying to escape, they say.

01:25:30.334 --> 01:25:31.051
Boerth?

01:25:32.586 --> 01:25:37.282
I know, Boerth.
I... lost my son last March.

01:25:37.382 --> 01:25:39.134
My only child.

01:25:39.718 --> 01:25:41.787
He was in the Hitler Youth.

01:25:41.887 --> 01:25:46.250
He went out to have some fun one night.
Paint slogans on a synagogue.

01:25:46.350 --> 01:25:51.982
Alfred was on the roof, he slipped
and fell. His neck was broken.

01:25:55.067 --> 01:25:58.554
Your son died for Hitler.
Isn't that enough for you?

01:25:58.654 --> 01:26:03.058
Plenty. I don't want
97 more dead on this ship.

01:26:03.158 --> 01:26:07.271
I told you. It will happen
at the mooring mast. No one aboard.

01:26:07.371 --> 01:26:10.107
My God, that's the last thing I want.

01:26:10.207 --> 01:26:12.234
Ask Lakehurst for marines
to cordon off the ship.

01:26:12.334 --> 01:26:15.213
Keep everyone at least 50 yards away.

01:26:17.172 --> 01:26:21.118
I would have to see the bomb,
know how it works.

01:26:21.218 --> 01:26:24.438
No. You have a wife at home.

01:26:25.514 --> 01:26:26.915
What time do I set the bomb for?

01:26:27.015 --> 01:26:28.417
I've got to see it.
Too much can go wrong.

01:26:28.517 --> 01:26:33.088
Just see that the ship is empty.
What time do I set the bomb for?

01:26:33.188 --> 01:26:36.283
Ritter, I can do it without you
very easily.

01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:46.118
The ship lands at 5:00.

01:26:47.077 --> 01:26:48.604
All the passengers off at 5:30.

01:26:48.704 --> 01:26:52.357
Another half-hour
to unload the freight and the mail.

01:26:52.457 --> 01:26:55.027
Liberty party leaves at 6:30.

01:26:55.127 --> 01:26:57.779
Remaining crew will eat
at the naval station mess.

01:26:57.879 --> 01:27:01.679
Captain Fellows's dinner party
for the officers at 7:00.

01:27:02.259 --> 01:27:03.952
Anyone standing watch I'll evacuate.

01:27:04.052 --> 01:27:07.852
I'll say... U.S. Customs
search, something.

01:27:08.974 --> 01:27:13.003
No supplies or fuel or hydrogen
will be loaded until after 8:00.

01:27:13.103 --> 01:27:14.855
What time?

01:27:16.481 --> 01:27:19.593
You'll leave with the liberty party.
Disappear into New York.

01:27:19.693 --> 01:27:23.263
- I'm staying aboard.
- That can't help Freda now.

01:27:23.363 --> 01:27:27.869
In the last few seconds I'm sending out
a radio signal that it was no accident.

01:27:29.035 --> 01:27:30.912
What time?

01:27:36.793 --> 01:27:38.670
7:30.

01:27:43.675 --> 01:27:46.144
- Check.
- Check.

01:27:47.471 --> 01:27:51.708
- I bet a hundred.
- Ohh, the lady's out for blood, eh?

01:27:51.808 --> 01:27:54.378
I use it to polish my fingernails.

01:27:54.478 --> 01:27:56.697
I'm out.

01:27:59.065 --> 01:28:02.511
I'll, uh... see you and raise you.

01:28:02.611 --> 01:28:05.514
And I'll raise you, sir.

01:28:05.614 --> 01:28:07.808
And I'll see you both.

01:28:07.908 --> 01:28:10.018
Well, I'm afraid that lets me out.

01:28:10.118 --> 01:28:13.480
Full house.
Sorry it's not strip poker, Countess.

01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:17.084
You'd be looking for a fig leaf.
Straight flush.

01:28:18.502 --> 01:28:22.052
Well, we live and learn.

01:28:23.256 --> 01:28:28.638
Well, once more
into the breach, dear friends.

01:28:39.356 --> 01:28:43.719
Spah was in the hull again,
and the stewardess found these in the cabin.

01:28:43.819 --> 01:28:45.947
Excellent, Martin.

01:28:46.947 --> 01:28:49.766
This could mean he's working for
someone else, someone who needs these.

01:28:49.866 --> 01:28:53.712
- Who?
- That's the man I want you to find...

01:28:54.246 --> 01:28:57.250
after we, uh... take care of these two.

01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:03.947
What happened to the tape, Mr. Pajetta?

01:29:04.047 --> 01:29:06.616
Since when have you become
the local house detective?

01:29:06.716 --> 01:29:08.076
I deputized him.

01:29:08.176 --> 01:29:11.079
Until we land, you and Major Napier
will be confined to your cabin.

01:29:11.179 --> 01:29:13.165
- Come along.
- What about the game?

01:29:13.265 --> 01:29:15.292
You can play hearts
with Mr. Pajetta in the cabin.

01:29:15.392 --> 01:29:17.794
You're going to regret this, sir.

01:29:17.894 --> 01:29:21.965
- My nephew is very close to Mussolini.
- Thank you both.

01:29:22.065 --> 01:29:24.426
May I send a bottle of Chianti
to your cabin?

01:29:24.526 --> 01:29:27.345
Madame, what you can do
with that bottle of Chianti...

01:29:27.445 --> 01:29:30.494
I won't say in front of these gentlemen.

01:29:37.163 --> 01:29:41.509
Well, Countess, I never thought
I'd enjoy losing so much.

01:29:49.009 --> 01:29:51.808
Thank you, dear Franz,
for the assignment.

01:29:52.429 --> 01:29:54.706
I made enough to fill 20 trunks.

01:29:54.806 --> 01:29:56.524
How did you do it?

01:29:57.350 --> 01:30:01.379
They cheat. I believe they earn
their living that way.

01:30:01.479 --> 01:30:03.632
The cane.

01:30:03.732 --> 01:30:08.053
- Pajetta taps out signals with it.
- And you still won?

01:30:08.153 --> 01:30:11.515
I managed to scramble their signals.

01:30:11.615 --> 01:30:14.935
I'd say your ten percent
was worth several cases of champagne.

01:30:15.035 --> 01:30:17.854
- Shall we start drinking it up?
- Better send it to me.

01:30:17.954 --> 01:30:21.959
I'll celebrate my homecoming
in a bath of champagne.

01:30:23.877 --> 01:30:26.471
I'd love to join you, Franz.

01:30:28.298 --> 01:30:31.677
- But I'm not going back.
- I know.

01:30:32.761 --> 01:30:36.140
Who tries to bring a wardrobe trunk
aboard a zeppelin?

01:30:41.645 --> 01:30:44.273
Oh, dear sweet Franz.

01:30:45.607 --> 01:30:48.156
It's all so depressing, isn't it?

01:30:50.278 --> 01:30:52.531
This helps a little.

01:30:53.073 --> 01:30:55.976
It's not what I need now. Thanks.

01:30:56.076 --> 01:30:58.545
No, it's a poor substitute.

01:31:03.917 --> 01:31:06.966
It makes no sense at all,
does it, Franz?

01:31:11.007 --> 01:31:13.260
That you and I ever met.

01:31:20.058 --> 01:31:22.652
I'll see you to say good-bye.

01:31:53.717 --> 01:31:55.744
Kirby. Kirby!

01:31:55.844 --> 01:31:59.789
Check over your procedures
for a high landing.

01:31:59.889 --> 01:32:02.208
Pruss just sent word he's gonna try one.

01:32:02.308 --> 01:32:05.045
Pruss is nuts!
An electric front's moving in.

01:32:05.145 --> 01:32:07.380
Well, he's gonna try it.

01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:13.428
And, Kirby, when she's hooked up,
slip her nose into the cup real easy.

01:32:13.528 --> 01:32:19.225
Just keep remembering, there's
seven million cubic feet of hydrogen...

01:32:19.325 --> 01:32:21.953
at the end of our fishing pole!

01:32:39.179 --> 01:32:41.873
My God, the Queen. I've had it.

01:32:41.973 --> 01:32:44.209
Not necessarily.
We land at Lakehurst at 5:00.

01:32:44.309 --> 01:32:46.983
She's just taking on her tugs.

01:35:21.591 --> 01:35:24.140
Boerth, what's there?

01:35:27.305 --> 01:35:30.959
- Find something, Karl?
- That patch looked weak.

01:35:31.059 --> 01:35:33.795
Must have loosened
when the outer skin ripped.

01:35:33.895 --> 01:35:37.048
I reinforced it.
I'm sure it's secure now.

01:35:37.148 --> 01:35:40.903
Uh-huh. Well, come on.
The chef's got sandwiches waiting for us.

01:35:49.244 --> 01:35:52.272
Well, Bisma refused us
that detachment of marines.

01:35:52.372 --> 01:35:54.023
Did you tell him the score?

01:35:54.123 --> 01:35:57.485
He knows the score.
It was quite a battle.

01:35:57.585 --> 01:35:59.696
He called the Hindenburg
a flying crematorium.

01:35:59.796 --> 01:36:01.656
Doesn't want his men near it.

01:36:01.756 --> 01:36:06.478
Damn. I hope Washington
gives Lehmann the helium.

01:36:10.473 --> 01:36:13.226
- Mr. Dimmler.
- Yes.

01:36:14.269 --> 01:36:16.796
I just found this stuck in the catwalk.

01:36:16.896 --> 01:36:19.866
Jesus. Any damage?

01:36:20.650 --> 01:36:23.344
- No, I don't think so, sir.
- Something wrong?

01:36:23.444 --> 01:36:27.098
Ludecke just found this in the catwalk.
Some idiot must've dropped it.

01:36:27.198 --> 01:36:29.225
Who does it belong to, Ludecke?

01:36:29.325 --> 01:36:33.438
- I don't know, sir.
- He didn't report it? Damn fool.

01:36:33.538 --> 01:36:35.523
A knife dropped inside
the hull could cause sparks...

01:36:35.623 --> 01:36:39.027
damage a wire, control cable.
Christ knows what.

01:36:39.127 --> 01:36:42.973
We've got to find out who owns that knife
and why he didn't report it.

01:36:46.884 --> 01:36:49.262
We want to see your knives.

01:36:56.477 --> 01:36:58.821
Your knife, please, Karl.

01:37:01.232 --> 01:37:04.862
Ludecke found this in the hull
a few minutes ago.

01:37:07.322 --> 01:37:08.973
He doesn't have it.

01:37:09.073 --> 01:37:11.726
I left it on my bunk
when I went to wash up.

01:37:11.826 --> 01:37:14.938
Someone must've borrowed it.
Please forgive my appearance, Captain.

01:37:15.038 --> 01:37:16.856
- Is this yours?
- No, sir.

01:37:16.956 --> 01:37:17.857
Can you prove it?

01:37:17.957 --> 01:37:21.069
My knife has a nick in the guard from
that fight we got in in Shanghai...

01:37:21.169 --> 01:37:22.862
when we went around
the world on the Graf.

01:37:22.962 --> 01:37:25.323
Arrest him, question all of them.

01:37:25.423 --> 01:37:28.518
Arrest me, Captain,
because my knife was borrowed?

01:37:30.678 --> 01:37:31.913
Enough of this stupid business.

01:37:32.013 --> 01:37:33.706
Get dressed and go to
your landing station, Chief.

01:37:33.806 --> 01:37:36.084
- Yes, sir.
- You men too.

01:37:36.184 --> 01:37:39.404
I trust the men in the Zeppelin family.

01:38:18.684 --> 01:38:21.254
That's at least 25 knots.

01:38:21.354 --> 01:38:24.632
Hell, they're only showing surface winds.
What's happened to gusts?

01:38:24.732 --> 01:38:26.968
They can't get it fixed, sir.

01:38:27.068 --> 01:38:28.991
Flash red, damn it. Flash red.

01:38:33.199 --> 01:38:34.684
Signal red, Captain.

01:38:34.784 --> 01:38:38.021
Thank you kindly.
I thought it was a Christmas tree.

01:38:38.121 --> 01:38:40.481
Send this to Fellows.

01:38:40.581 --> 01:38:44.360
Riding out weather. Shall delay landing
until further notice from N.A.L.

01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:47.464
Looking forward to dinner. Pruss.

01:39:18.995 --> 01:39:21.773
Make sure the dog is unloaded
as soon as we land, all right?

01:39:21.873 --> 01:39:24.317
Here's a little something extra for you.
You have been a doll.

01:39:24.417 --> 01:39:27.320
That's okay, Mrs. Channing.
I like dogs. Thanks, anyway.

01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:29.697
- Well, lovely.
- It's a set for my zeppelin act.

01:39:29.797 --> 01:39:32.033
I had better ones,
but they disappear from my cabin.

01:39:32.133 --> 01:39:34.494
Somebody's trying to steal my act.
That's how good it is.

01:39:34.594 --> 01:39:39.082
Joe, I've gotta be honest with you.
It's not right for my show.

01:39:39.182 --> 01:39:40.399
You don't like it, huh?

01:39:41.642 --> 01:39:44.337
Well, I guess it's back to the circus.

01:39:44.437 --> 01:39:46.155
- Joe?
- Yeah.

01:39:46.856 --> 01:39:48.216
You forgot this one.

01:39:48.316 --> 01:39:52.303
It's just a drawing that I made
of the crazy rainbow for my kids.

01:39:52.403 --> 01:39:54.764
- How many children do you have?
- Three.

01:39:54.864 --> 01:39:59.227
One seven, one four, and a baby boy
who's gonna be an acrobat.

01:39:59.327 --> 01:40:01.521
Believe you me,
we have circus enough at home.

01:40:01.621 --> 01:40:03.481
I'll bet.

01:40:03.581 --> 01:40:06.609
Anyhow, it's been a great honor
to know people like you.

01:40:06.709 --> 01:40:09.112
- Thank you, Joe.
- We had some fun, huh?

01:40:09.212 --> 01:40:11.180
- Yeah.
- Good-bye.

01:40:14.759 --> 01:40:17.453
Reed, I'd like to see Joe's act.

01:40:17.553 --> 01:40:19.455
Okay, little mother.

01:40:19.555 --> 01:40:21.666
I guess we'll give him
an audition sometime next week.

01:40:21.766 --> 01:40:22.875
Good.

01:40:22.975 --> 01:40:24.669
- This is absurd!
- Yes, ma'am.

01:40:24.769 --> 01:40:28.548
I'm sure it's just a technicality that
will be straightened out before we land.

01:40:28.648 --> 01:40:33.136
- I want my passport this instant, Kirsch.
- It's not here, Countess.

01:40:33.236 --> 01:40:35.513
It's been picked up.

01:40:35.613 --> 01:40:37.807
Same thing happened
to a friend of mine in Italy.

01:40:37.907 --> 01:40:40.285
You wouldn't believe
the excuse they gave him.

01:40:44.163 --> 01:40:45.665
Franz.

01:40:47.291 --> 01:40:49.777
- They've picked up my passport.
- On whose orders?

01:40:49.877 --> 01:40:51.779
Yours, maybe.

01:40:51.879 --> 01:40:54.407
Who else knows about Peenemunde?
You're the...

01:40:54.507 --> 01:40:56.742
It's only a little storm, Countess.

01:40:56.842 --> 01:40:59.412
In an hour you'll be laughing
about it with your daughter.

01:40:59.512 --> 01:41:01.747
In fact, I'm going to escort you
from the ship personally...

01:41:01.847 --> 01:41:04.771
to make sure that I see her. All right?

01:41:26.497 --> 01:41:29.775
- We want to see your knife.
- You've seen my knife. I'm busy.

01:41:29.875 --> 01:41:31.673
Come on!

01:41:35.464 --> 01:41:38.284
- This is Knorr's knife, isn't it?
- The hell it is.

01:41:38.384 --> 01:41:41.704
A nick on the guard like Knorr said.
You stole it when you broke your own.

01:41:41.804 --> 01:41:44.207
- What were you doing?
- It's my knife!

01:41:44.307 --> 01:41:47.502
- You're lying.
- You can't arrest me without Ritter.

01:41:47.602 --> 01:41:48.945
Watch.

01:41:54.442 --> 01:41:59.118
Vogel, you Gestapo idiot.
You're making the mistake of your life.

01:42:08.706 --> 01:42:11.442
Captain, some of the passengers
are getting nervous.

01:42:11.542 --> 01:42:13.152
How long will it be before we land?

01:42:13.252 --> 01:42:15.363
Whenever Naval Air at Lakehurst
gives us the green light.

01:42:15.463 --> 01:42:17.490
- When do you estimate that'll be?
- Tell the passengers...

01:42:17.590 --> 01:42:21.060
we'll land when conditions are right
and not a minute sooner.

01:42:27.016 --> 01:42:30.002
Three degrees out of trim.
Light in the bow.

01:42:30.102 --> 01:42:32.901
Drop ballast aft. Two hundred kilos.

01:42:36.150 --> 01:42:37.718
Yes, she does feel tail-heavy, Captain.

01:42:37.818 --> 01:42:40.471
She's tail-heavy
because wind drove the rain aft.

01:42:40.571 --> 01:42:42.223
The moisture will evaporate
in a few minutes.

01:42:42.323 --> 01:42:46.936
When we're over the field,
how long will it be before

01:42:47.036 --> 01:42:50.022
- The passengers are certain to ask.
- A high landing takes 15 minutes.

01:42:50.122 --> 01:42:52.858
Allow another 20
to disembark passengers.

01:42:52.958 --> 01:42:57.029
Um, I understand the Countess's
passport is being held.

01:42:57.129 --> 01:43:00.533
Rotten. Vogel said it was
a matter of internal security.

01:43:00.633 --> 01:43:02.827
- Vogel took it?
- What's the matter with you, Ritter?

01:43:02.927 --> 01:43:05.663
I assume you know what's going on
in your own department.

01:43:05.763 --> 01:43:07.561
Yes, sir, I do.

01:43:48.597 --> 01:43:50.124
If the wind shifts...

01:43:50.224 --> 01:43:53.002
have your linesmen hang on
until the main wire comes down.

01:43:53.102 --> 01:43:54.570
Boerth?

01:43:55.438 --> 01:43:56.881
I'm looking for Boerth.
Have you seen him?

01:43:56.981 --> 01:43:59.655
I need him too. Try the north section.

01:44:11.746 --> 01:44:14.190
- What's that?
- That's just a worn place we patched.

01:44:14.290 --> 01:44:15.733
I'm sure it's secure.

01:44:15.833 --> 01:44:18.486
All right, but let's have a man watch
this bag till we're on the ground.

01:44:18.586 --> 01:44:19.462
Yes, sir.

01:44:20.838 --> 01:44:23.091
Boerth? Boerth!

01:44:31.474 --> 01:44:35.479
Send a Decca. Recommend landing now.
Ground crew is ready.

01:44:40.107 --> 01:44:43.552
Reply to N.A.L. Proceeding to land.

01:44:43.652 --> 01:44:47.431
Will be late for dinner.
Apologies to madam. Signed Pruss.

01:44:47.531 --> 01:44:49.350
I'm uneasy about cell four, Captain.

01:44:49.450 --> 01:44:51.644
We might have to make
a major repair before going back.

01:44:51.744 --> 01:44:53.604
We'll see. Landing stations.

01:44:53.704 --> 01:44:56.816
Two degrees light in the bow
and tail-heavy.

01:44:56.916 --> 01:44:59.886
Six men from the off watch into the bow.

01:45:04.799 --> 01:45:06.909
- Have you seen Boerth?
- No, Colonel.

01:45:07.009 --> 01:45:09.478
No, sir. He should be here.

01:45:20.564 --> 01:45:23.551
- Wind shifted to the west.
- Gusts?

01:45:23.651 --> 01:45:27.326
- No reading on gusts.
- No wonder they lose all their airships.

01:45:28.447 --> 01:45:32.452
Hard rudder to port.
Aft engines, full astern.

01:45:34.578 --> 01:45:36.564
Line up with her, knuckleheads!

01:45:36.664 --> 01:45:40.860
Move your butts!
She'll keep her nose to the wind!

01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:42.837
Come on. Move it!

01:45:43.587 --> 01:45:45.573
Where's Boerth?

01:45:45.673 --> 01:45:48.096
His landing station's in the nose.

01:46:30.801 --> 01:46:33.996
Ship in trim but rising slightly.

01:46:34.096 --> 01:46:36.349
Valve all cells, five seconds.

01:46:45.357 --> 01:46:47.985
Stand by for starboard line drop.

01:47:13.761 --> 01:47:16.455
Beautiful. Level as a board.

01:47:16.555 --> 01:47:20.251
- Pruss is really showin' us how.
- The ship is standing still now.

01:47:20.351 --> 01:47:22.461
Everything seems remarkably still.

01:47:22.561 --> 01:47:26.257
She hovers just short of the mast, waiting
for her nose cone to be connected up.

01:47:26.357 --> 01:47:28.008
A great floating palace.

01:47:28.108 --> 01:47:31.470
Please, Mr. Douglas, you have to leave.
I'm closing up.

01:47:31.570 --> 01:47:35.391
So we're finally landing.
That calls for another drink.

01:47:35.491 --> 01:47:37.209
I should have taken a rowboat.

01:47:38.327 --> 01:47:42.002
Neuhaus, we've got a jammed cable.
Come bear a hand.

01:47:57.346 --> 01:47:59.849
Out, Ritter. I've taken over.

01:48:01.517 --> 01:48:02.734
Out!

01:48:10.943 --> 01:48:13.492
Boerth! Boerth, it's Ritter!

01:48:14.613 --> 01:48:17.224
It's 7:20. Where's the bomb?

01:48:17.324 --> 01:48:19.577
He stole my knife.

01:48:21.078 --> 01:48:24.773
Listen to me.
There's less than ten minutes left.

01:48:24.873 --> 01:48:27.251
We're all gonna die. Where's the bomb?

01:48:29.712 --> 01:48:31.931
Repair patch four.

01:50:54.523 --> 01:50:56.196
Ritter!

01:51:10.455 --> 01:51:12.549
No. No!

01:51:20.674 --> 01:51:24.495
It burst into flame! It burst into flame
and it's falling, it's crashing!

01:51:24.595 --> 01:51:26.330
Watch it! Watch it!
Get out of the way, please!

01:51:26.430 --> 01:51:28.683
Get out of the way! Get this, Johnny!

01:51:46.408 --> 01:51:48.206
Some landing.

01:51:53.832 --> 01:51:56.318
Run! Run! Get outta there!

01:51:56.418 --> 01:51:59.672
Hold it! Hold it! Stand fast, damn it!

01:52:06.970 --> 01:52:09.456
No, Dimmler, don't drop ballast!

01:52:09.556 --> 01:52:12.184
Let the stern fall.
Give them a chance to get out back there.

01:52:14.770 --> 01:52:16.522
Oh, my God!

01:52:17.147 --> 01:52:19.049
Down the stairs. Come on.

01:52:19.149 --> 01:52:20.947
Here! Give me that!

01:52:24.321 --> 01:52:26.995
- Fire extinguishers!
- Come on! Fire extinguishers!

01:52:39.962 --> 01:52:41.839
Stay with me. Help me.

01:53:43.317 --> 01:53:45.035
Hurry! Grab those ropes!

01:54:15.891 --> 01:54:19.586
- No! I can't! I can't!
- Jump! Jump! Please!

01:54:19.686 --> 01:54:21.797
- My babies! No!
- Jump!

01:54:21.897 --> 01:54:23.615
It's your only chance!

01:54:26.985 --> 01:54:30.489
Oh, no! No! No!

01:55:26.545 --> 01:55:27.404
Come on!

01:55:27.504 --> 01:55:30.324
- Jump!
- Come on, jump! Hurry!

01:55:30.424 --> 01:55:31.767
Come on! Come on!

01:55:34.511 --> 01:55:37.560
- Get up! Jesus, run!
- Get outta here!

01:55:41.518 --> 01:55:43.754
Come on! Jump! Don't be afraid!

01:55:43.854 --> 01:55:44.838
Couple of yellow-bellies!

01:55:44.938 --> 01:55:47.862
Are you gonna let a girl
be braver than you are?

01:55:49.359 --> 01:55:50.736
Run!

01:55:51.278 --> 01:55:54.407
Come on! Your brother did it!
You can do it too!

01:57:34.923 --> 01:57:35.799
Oh, God!

01:57:44.683 --> 01:57:46.105
Oh, my God!

01:57:48.728 --> 01:57:51.572
- You're all right.
- Oh, my God! My God!

01:58:30.478 --> 01:58:32.981
Sailor! Help him out!

01:58:39.988 --> 01:58:41.389
This way!

01:58:41.489 --> 01:58:43.207
Major! Emilio!

01:58:44.409 --> 01:58:47.521
- I was afraid your luck had run out on ya!
- It's a miracle anybody's alive.

01:58:47.621 --> 01:58:50.440
All right, get outta here!
Come on, get out!

01:58:50.540 --> 01:58:52.713
Take care of yourselves! Go ahead!

01:58:56.004 --> 01:58:57.096
Thank you!

01:59:06.890 --> 01:59:09.063
All right. Turn on the water.

01:59:17.192 --> 01:59:19.411
Trudi! Trudi!

01:59:23.448 --> 01:59:26.952
Oh, my baby! Oh, thank God!

01:59:40.423 --> 01:59:42.050
Lehmann.

01:59:59.275 --> 02:00:00.652
Ernst.

02:00:04.781 --> 02:00:07.350
What happened, Ernst? Ernst.

02:00:07.450 --> 02:00:08.918
Ernst!

02:00:09.577 --> 02:00:11.671
How did it happen?

02:01:05.759 --> 02:01:08.578
<i>Colonel Franz Ritter, dead.</i>

02:01:08.678 --> 02:01:11.206
<i>Rigger Karl Boerth, dead.</i>

02:01:11.306 --> 02:01:13.650
<i>S.S. Captain Martin Vogel, survived.</i>

02:01:14.601 --> 02:01:16.753
<i>Captain Max Pruss, survived.</i>

02:01:16.853 --> 02:01:19.322
<i>Captain Ernst Lehmann, dead.</i>

02:01:20.231 --> 02:01:21.778
<i>Albert Breslau, dead.</i>

02:01:22.734 --> 02:01:24.427
<i>Mildred Breslau, survived.</i>

02:01:24.527 --> 02:01:26.700
<i>Edward Douglas, dead.</i>

02:01:27.447 --> 02:01:29.599
<i>Elliott Howell III, dead.</i>

02:01:29.699 --> 02:01:33.019
<i>Dead. Survived. Dead.</i>

02:01:33.119 --> 02:01:36.356
<i>Dead. Dead. Survived.</i>

02:01:36.456 --> 02:01:39.442
<i>Survived. Dead. Dead.</i>

02:01:39.542 --> 02:01:42.028
<i>Dead. Survived.</i>

02:01:42.128 --> 02:01:45.949
<i>In all, 13 passengers,
22 members of the crew...</i>

02:01:46.049 --> 02:01:48.535
<i>one navy linesman, dead.</i>

02:01:48.635 --> 02:01:50.478
<i>Sixty-two survivors.</i>

02:01:51.721 --> 02:01:54.541
<i>The final report
of the board of inquiry states:</i>

02:01:54.641 --> 02:01:58.336
<i>"The most plausible theories
for the Hindenburg disaster are:</i>

02:01:58.436 --> 02:02:04.217
<i>Structural failure, static electricity
St. Elmo's fire, sabotage."</i>

02:02:04.317 --> 02:02:06.386
<i>No completely certain proof
has been found...</i>

02:02:06.486 --> 02:02:09.389
<i>for any of the possibilities cited.</i>

02:02:09.489 --> 02:02:12.142
<i>The German commission report
goes a step further.</i>

02:02:12.242 --> 02:02:15.353
<i>It states: "The possibility
of deliberate destruction...</i>

02:02:15.453 --> 02:02:20.380
<i>must be admitted since no other
originating cause can be proven."</i>

02:02:21.042 --> 02:02:23.111
<i>However, the new Reich
could not admit...</i>

02:02:23.211 --> 02:02:26.197
<i>that a resistance,
much less a single saboteur...</i>

02:02:26.297 --> 02:02:28.992
<i>had brought down
the great symbol of Nazi power.</i>

02:02:29.092 --> 02:02:33.872
<i>Chancellor Hitler concluded therefore
that it was an act of God.</i>

02:02:33.972 --> 02:02:37.584
<i>During the investigation, the eyewitness
account recorded by Herb Morrison...</i>

02:02:37.684 --> 02:02:41.212
<i>for radio station WLS Chicago
was heard many times.</i>

02:02:41.312 --> 02:02:42.130
<i>...standing still now.</i>

02:02:42.230 --> 02:02:47.177
<i>The back motors of the ship are just
holding it, just enough to keep it from...</i>

02:02:47.277 --> 02:02:50.722
<i>It burst into flame! It burst into flame
and it's falling, it's crashing!</i>

02:02:50.822 --> 02:02:53.099
<i>Watch it! Watch it!
It's crashing! Terrible!</i>

02:02:53.199 --> 02:02:55.059
<i>Oh, my! Get out of the way, please!</i>

02:02:55.159 --> 02:02:58.146
<i>It's burning... bursting into flames
and it's falling on the mooring pad...</i>

02:02:58.246 --> 02:03:00.064
<i>and all the folks agree
that this is terrible!</i>

02:03:00.164 --> 02:03:02.609
<i>This is one of the worst catastrophes
in the world!</i>

02:03:02.709 --> 02:03:05.528
<i>Oh, it's... This place is...</i>

02:03:05.628 --> 02:03:08.531
<i>Oh, four or five hundred feet
into the sky it...</i>

02:03:08.631 --> 02:03:10.658
<i>It's a terrific crash,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

02:03:10.758 --> 02:03:14.788
<i>The smoke and the flames now,
and the frame is crashing to the ground...</i>

02:03:14.888 --> 02:03:16.915
<i>not quite to the mooring mast.</i>

02:03:17.015 --> 02:03:20.543
<i>Oh, the humanity, and all
the passengers screaming around here!</i>

02:03:20.643 --> 02:03:24.255
<i>I told you...
I can't even talk to people...</i>

02:03:24.355 --> 02:03:26.549
<i>whose friends are on there.</i>

02:03:26.649 --> 02:03:28.968
<i>It's... It's... It's, uh... Oh!</i>

02:03:29.068 --> 02:03:31.387
<i>I can't talk, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

02:03:31.487 --> 02:03:33.598
<i>I can't...</i>

02:03:33.698 --> 02:03:37.623
<i>Listen, folks, I'm gonna have to stop
for a minute because I've lost my voice.</i>

02:03:37.702 --> 02:03:40.581
<i>This is the worst thing
I've ever witnessed.</i>

02:03:41.305 --> 02:03:47.706
