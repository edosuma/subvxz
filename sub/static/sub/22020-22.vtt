00:08.807 --> 00:10.785
<i>You put a good man in jail.</i>

00:10.873 --> 00:12.410
You put a good man in jail.

00:12.477 --> 00:15.402
Alvin Olinsky has dedicated his life

00:15.449 --> 00:16.649
to the people of this city.

00:16.681 --> 00:18.750
He dedicated his life to you.

00:18.783 --> 00:20.652
That's why he's in jail.

00:20.685 --> 00:23.168
You say what you want,
but you did him dirty.

00:23.231 --> 00:27.068
<i>I did him the way I had to. Take a seat.</i>

00:27.100 --> 00:30.271
Let's get this done.

00:30.303 --> 00:32.406
I'm with Sergeant Hank Voight
to discuss...

00:32.439 --> 00:34.541
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:34.575 --> 00:38.112
No recordings, not until we have a deal.

00:41.649 --> 00:43.118
Okay.

00:43.151 --> 00:44.486
Tell me what you have to say.

00:44.518 --> 00:47.756
What kind of deal you
looking for, off the record?

00:47.789 --> 00:49.090
We'll go from there.

00:57.131 --> 01:00.100
Let's say, hypothetically...

01:03.103 --> 01:07.274
I confess to killing the son
of a bitch who murdered my son.

01:10.445 --> 01:15.749
I tell you I hunted
Kevin Bingham like a dog,

01:15.782 --> 01:20.087
made him dig his own grave,

01:20.121 --> 01:23.158
and then shot him in the face.

01:27.695 --> 01:31.098
I say that on the record.

01:32.633 --> 01:36.505
Would that be enough to drop
all charges against Olinsky?

01:43.443 --> 01:45.679
I think it would.

01:45.713 --> 01:47.381
Let me call Osha,

01:47.414 --> 01:51.485
and we will work out all
the details in person tonight.

<i>I'll listen to your proffer, Hank.</i>

02:08.301 --> 02:10.572
If everything you have to say
is consistent with what Denny

02:10.604 --> 02:13.708
told me over the phone,
I'll drop any and all charges

02:13.741 --> 02:15.309
against Detective Olinsky, all right?

02:15.343 --> 02:17.411
And Alvin gets released from Cook County

02:17.444 --> 02:19.213
- first thing in the morning?
- Absolutely.

02:19.247 --> 02:22.717
Deal.

02:22.749 --> 02:25.028
Okay.

02:27.788 --> 02:30.190
This is Assistant State's
Attorney James Osha.

02:30.224 --> 02:31.726
I'm here with Lieutenant Denny Woods,

02:31.759 --> 02:33.294
independent auditor,

02:33.326 --> 02:35.395
and Sergeant Hank Voight,
head of intelligence.

02:35.428 --> 02:37.397
We're here to discuss
the events surrounding

02:37.431 --> 02:39.600
the murder of Kevin Bingham.

02:39.634 --> 02:42.303
Just tell us what happened,
Sergeant Voight.

02:42.336 --> 02:44.597
More details, the better.

02:48.638 --> 02:51.206
Ready when you are, Hank.

02:55.547 --> 02:57.570
Hank.

02:59.133 --> 03:02.923
Hey, man, listen, I'm looking
for Detective Alvin Olinsky...

03:02.956 --> 03:04.391
Hey, Al!

03:04.425 --> 03:06.790
Chicago PD. Al.

03:07.861 --> 03:10.219
Al, it's me.

03:10.264 --> 03:13.167
You be strong, you hear me?

03:13.200 --> 03:15.369
You hang in there, Al.

03:15.403 --> 03:17.905
- I got this, man.
- I know.

03:17.939 --> 03:19.707
- I got this.
- I know.

03:19.748 --> 03:21.184
They're gonna fix you up.

03:21.208 --> 03:23.510
You're gonna be... you're gonna be okay.

04:21.468 --> 04:24.304
Oh, hey, Doc. I'm Sergeant Voight.

04:24.338 --> 04:26.307
- How can I help you?
- This patient in there,

04:26.340 --> 04:28.576
Detective Olinksy, how is he?

04:28.608 --> 04:31.745
He didn't make it. I'm very sorry.

06:03.750 --> 06:05.516
You okay?

06:09.834 --> 06:12.077
All right.

06:13.848 --> 06:15.280
All right.

06:15.935 --> 06:17.663
I know.

06:18.651 --> 06:22.088
I mean, we're all in pain. I get it.

06:23.591 --> 06:25.826
But the best way to honor Al

06:25.860 --> 06:30.154
is to find the son of a bitch
responsible for this.

06:30.463 --> 06:32.927
So, for now,

06:33.340 --> 06:35.576
let's pull all our energy,

06:35.735 --> 06:40.640
all our passion... our love for Al...

06:40.674 --> 06:44.679
into finding the person who did this.

06:44.711 --> 06:47.147
I know that's what Al would want.

06:47.180 --> 06:50.617
I guarantee it.

06:50.651 --> 06:53.086
Then,

06:53.119 --> 06:56.923
when this is over,

06:56.956 --> 07:00.394
when we got this prick,

07:00.427 --> 07:03.398
then we'll mourn Al.

07:12.006 --> 07:14.142
So...

07:14.175 --> 07:19.013
take the time you need.

07:19.045 --> 07:20.814
But just know...

07:20.848 --> 07:23.985
right now we got some business to do.

07:35.862 --> 07:38.499
Hey! Hey!

07:38.531 --> 07:41.002
Oh, man, you got some balls
showing up here.

07:41.035 --> 07:43.104
How's he doing?

07:43.136 --> 07:45.172
He's dead, Jimmy.

07:45.206 --> 07:47.039
Dead.

07:49.742 --> 07:51.812
I've known Al for 20 years.

07:51.845 --> 07:55.216
Well, you buried him, and I was there.

07:55.249 --> 07:57.218
- I was in the courtroom.
- No, no, no.

07:57.251 --> 07:58.753
That's not how it went down.

07:58.785 --> 08:00.521
- Oh, yeah?
- My hands were tied.

08:00.561 --> 08:03.333
Too many people involved...
Denny, the State's Attorney,

08:03.358 --> 08:05.568
- the mayor.
- That doesn't mean you just...

08:05.593 --> 08:06.927
just roll over and bury the guy.

08:06.961 --> 08:10.564
- I was doing my job.
- You screwed him, Jimmy!

08:15.703 --> 08:17.337
Hank, listen to me.

08:17.362 --> 08:21.462
Stop, Hank. I didn't have a choice.

08:25.980 --> 08:27.881
I understand the press is all over you,

08:27.915 --> 08:29.984
but I'm not gonna give
a quote or a statement

08:30.016 --> 08:31.552
until I know the damn facts.

08:31.584 --> 08:33.220
Until then, just...
just refer all calls.

08:33.254 --> 08:35.623
Refer... what the hell you doing?

08:35.655 --> 08:37.758
I want every piece
of surveillance footage.

08:37.791 --> 08:40.061
- Hank, maybe we could...
- I wanna talk to every guard...

08:40.094 --> 08:41.696
- Hank, slow down.
- And inmate in the vicinity.

08:41.729 --> 08:43.063
I am the warden of this place.

08:43.096 --> 08:44.698
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

08:44.731 --> 08:46.533
The son of a bitch who let some punk

08:46.567 --> 08:48.602
kill my good friend, Alvin Olinsky.

08:48.635 --> 08:50.036
We will find out who did this...

08:50.070 --> 08:52.105
I will find out who did this!

08:52.139 --> 08:54.207
This is my case.

08:54.240 --> 08:56.143
You understand?

08:58.546 --> 09:01.682
- You're unbelievable.
- One,

09:01.715 --> 09:04.585
I need an office here, in the jail.

09:04.618 --> 09:07.588
Two, I want every piece
of evidence you have

09:07.620 --> 09:10.691
in the next ten minutes,

09:10.724 --> 09:13.828
or, you and me,
we're gonna have a problem.

09:16.797 --> 09:19.066
- All right, where we at?
- The jail is on lockdown.

09:19.099 --> 09:20.568
Good, keep me in the loop.

09:20.600 --> 09:21.802
Guards are going through
cells, hallways,

09:21.835 --> 09:23.237
laundry rooms, looking for blood.

09:23.269 --> 09:24.905
- Any eyewitnesses?
- Not yet.

09:24.938 --> 09:26.841
We talked to inmates that were
in proximity to the stabbing.

09:26.874 --> 09:28.276
Well, inmates being blind, I get.

09:28.308 --> 09:29.743
- What about guards?
- No luck so far.

09:29.777 --> 09:31.045
The weapon's at the lab.

09:31.077 --> 09:32.946
They're checking it for prints and DNA.

09:32.980 --> 09:34.749
It was a plastic comb before
they turned it into a shank.

09:34.782 --> 09:36.651
Boss, I found a guard
who actually saw the attack.

09:36.683 --> 09:38.018
His name is Dietz.
He's waiting in the hallway.

09:38.052 --> 09:40.153
Kim, Hailey... track down every frame

09:40.187 --> 09:41.656
of surveillance video
you can get your hands on.

09:41.688 --> 09:43.223
- Got it.
- Copy.

09:43.257 --> 09:45.626
We were escorting the inmates
to the cells after dinner

09:45.658 --> 09:47.694
and someone attacked him.

09:47.727 --> 09:49.796
Someone? You didn't see his face?

09:49.830 --> 09:52.033
No, it happened real fast.

09:52.066 --> 09:54.701
Were there no inmates standing nearby?

09:54.735 --> 09:57.904
No, I brought him back early
to protect him.

09:57.937 --> 09:59.907
Then my cell phone rang.
I got distracted.

09:59.940 --> 10:04.078
When I turned around, I saw
Olinsky on the floor over here.

10:04.110 --> 10:05.812
All right, finish up later.

10:05.845 --> 10:07.847
I ran over to him, called for help.

10:07.880 --> 10:10.650
- Right.
- I tried to stop the bleeding.

10:10.683 --> 10:13.754
- You got no idea who did this?
- Like I said, I didn't see it.

10:13.787 --> 10:15.056
If I were a betting man,
I'd say it had something

10:15.089 --> 10:16.657
to do with what happened two days ago.

10:16.690 --> 10:18.059
What are you talking about?

10:18.091 --> 10:20.160
Olinsky tuned up some
Aryan Nation idiot real good.

10:20.193 --> 10:22.362
Slammed his head into a cell
three, four times.

10:22.395 --> 10:26.166
All right,
what's this Aryan prick's name?

10:26.200 --> 10:29.070
- So how'd it go down, Ross?
- How'd what go down?

10:29.102 --> 10:30.837
The stabbing.

10:30.870 --> 10:33.773
'Cause we know he smacked you
around like a little bitch.

10:33.807 --> 10:37.244
You and your boys decided
to get a little payback.

10:37.277 --> 10:39.814
Wasn't me. Wish it was, though.

10:39.846 --> 10:42.783
Taking out a cop has a lot
of cachet in a place like this.

10:42.816 --> 10:46.653
It's like taking out
a pedophile or a rapist.

10:46.687 --> 10:48.656
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

10:48.688 --> 10:51.224
Too bad someone got to him first.

10:54.727 --> 10:56.930
Well, if it wasn't you, who was it?

10:56.964 --> 10:59.934
Go to hell.

11:02.336 --> 11:05.706
- I want a name.
- Don't got a name.

11:05.739 --> 11:08.974
Just a race...

11:08.975 --> 11:12.345
Dude that stabbed your boy...

11:12.379 --> 11:14.517
Was a taco-head.

11:21.355 --> 11:23.324
We get that surveillance video yet?

11:23.356 --> 11:25.225
Ruzek's pulling it up right now.

11:26.111 --> 11:29.369
All right, four cameras,
all of cell block G.

11:29.424 --> 11:31.432
Here comes Al walking right there.

11:31.479 --> 11:34.308
Walks up to these two guys.
They start jawing.

11:34.333 --> 11:36.957
Guard comes, breaks it up,
two guys keep moving.

11:36.982 --> 11:39.240
Now it's a different angle,
different camera.

11:39.896 --> 11:42.909
You're gonna see the guard
still with him at this point.

11:43.941 --> 11:46.346
Now, the guard's gonna get a phone call
right here and break away.

11:46.794 --> 11:49.283
Al keeps walking towards his cell.

11:49.316 --> 11:52.987
This is where it happens.

12:00.839 --> 12:02.407
Okay, run it.

12:09.381 --> 12:10.815
Wait, freeze it.

12:15.219 --> 12:17.507
All right, blow it up.

12:22.044 --> 12:23.847
Still can't see the bastard's face.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.495
All right, so we got any other angles?

12:25.520 --> 12:27.789
Other cameras?

12:27.871 --> 12:30.034
Pull it up right now.

12:34.193 --> 12:36.474
The hell is he doing?

12:37.197 --> 12:40.107
- He's just standing there.
- He's a coward.

12:42.389 --> 12:44.734
The son of a bitch is in on it.

12:45.726 --> 12:47.194
All right, his name is Dan Dietz.

12:47.227 --> 12:49.377
Run his financials. Antonio, come on.

12:49.402 --> 12:51.338
You and me.

12:53.433 --> 12:55.938
Who paid you to look the other way?

12:56.937 --> 12:58.338
We watched the video.

12:58.371 --> 13:01.486
You just stood there doing
nothing for five seconds.

13:03.009 --> 13:05.704
- Let me see your phone.
- Excuse me?

13:05.743 --> 13:09.771
There never was a call. It was a scam.

13:09.821 --> 13:12.110
Look, I had nothing to do
with what happened to Al.

13:12.157 --> 13:14.326
We just ran your financials, dumbass.

13:14.359 --> 13:16.662
Someone put five grand
into your checking account

13:16.696 --> 13:18.965
an hour before the attack.

13:18.998 --> 13:24.170
This is your one and
only chance to come clean.

13:24.277 --> 13:26.870
I...

13:26.938 --> 13:29.902
- Come on!
- Okay, I...

13:30.076 --> 13:31.945
I-I got some money.

13:31.978 --> 13:33.647
But he said it was just
gonna be a beatdown.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.048
He didn't say anything about
a stabbing, I swear to God.

13:35.080 --> 13:38.784
Who? Who paid you off?

13:40.141 --> 13:42.123
Who?

13:44.856 --> 13:46.425
Get up. I said, get up.

13:46.459 --> 13:48.194
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Hands in front.

13:48.226 --> 13:49.740
Take it easy, homes.

13:49.765 --> 13:52.716
You're under arrest for
the murder of a police officer.

13:53.266 --> 13:56.902
You're coming with me.

14:07.345 --> 14:11.183
The guard you paid off... Dietz.

14:11.216 --> 14:13.499
He gave you up.

14:21.159 --> 14:23.758
This can go one of two ways.

14:25.739 --> 14:27.975
Bad...

14:32.003 --> 14:34.407
Or really bad.

14:34.440 --> 14:36.142
You come clean.

14:36.175 --> 14:39.378
You tell me why you did it,
who you working with.

14:44.016 --> 14:46.849
Things will go a lot better
than if you don't.

14:48.287 --> 14:51.458
Kiss my Mexican ass, you...

15:06.471 --> 15:08.407
All right, that's...
guard, unlock the door.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.109
No, no, we're good, we're good.

15:10.143 --> 15:11.377
Listen, this is the guy that killed Al.

15:11.409 --> 15:13.145
I know that, but this not...

15:13.178 --> 15:15.013
No, what are you trying
to protect him for?

15:15.047 --> 15:17.016
Stop, we don't need you! Stop!

15:17.048 --> 15:19.752
Back up. This is not what Al would wa...

15:22.788 --> 15:25.057
I interrogated the prisoner.

15:25.082 --> 15:27.813
He was not cooperative.

15:27.902 --> 15:30.250
I am convinced he's involved.

15:35.133 --> 15:36.536
For God's sakes, Hank.

15:36.569 --> 15:39.339
Hey, he tried to choke me
with his handcuffs.

15:39.372 --> 15:40.974
What the hell are you doing here?

15:41.007 --> 15:43.910
You don't believe my story?

15:43.942 --> 15:48.814
- I wanna do right by Al...
- I said, he tried to choke me

15:48.848 --> 15:51.217
with his handcuffs.

15:51.249 --> 15:54.988
You don't believe me? Then file a beef.

15:55.021 --> 15:57.246
And get the hell off the case.

16:06.065 --> 16:07.719
Andre Gomez is definitely our guy.

16:07.744 --> 16:10.209
There was ton of blood on his
DOC uniform and his sneakers.

16:10.234 --> 16:11.792
They're on the way to the lab right now.

16:11.817 --> 16:14.003
Andre Gomez, 35, long jacket.

16:14.028 --> 16:15.430
Affiliated with the Latin Scorpions.

16:15.455 --> 16:16.699
Doing time on a double murder.

16:16.732 --> 16:18.467
Yeah, he's been at
Cook County for a month.

16:18.499 --> 16:19.882
His case is on appeal right now.

16:19.907 --> 16:22.070
- Huh.
- Okay, so why?

16:22.103 --> 16:24.031
Why Andre? Why Al?

16:24.094 --> 16:25.464
Well, he was a cop.

16:25.497 --> 16:27.933
Maybe, but if it's just police hate,

16:27.965 --> 16:29.366
why put in all that effort?

16:29.399 --> 16:30.835
I mean, this guy paid a guard

16:30.868 --> 16:32.137
five grand to look the other way.

16:32.170 --> 16:33.839
We know where this money came from?

16:33.872 --> 16:35.841
Yeah, Western Union.
It was a money transfer.

16:35.873 --> 16:37.242
We can't ID the sender, though.

16:37.274 --> 16:38.476
Right, so how the hell's some punk

16:38.509 --> 16:40.945
doing life get his hands on 5K?

16:40.979 --> 16:42.881
- Doesn't make sense.
- Well, he definitely has

16:42.913 --> 16:44.482
somebody helping him on the outside.

16:44.516 --> 16:47.085
The question is, is someone
on the outside helping Andre,

16:47.118 --> 16:49.921
or is Andre helping someone
on the outside?

16:49.954 --> 16:51.423
You think this could be
a contracted hit?

16:51.455 --> 16:53.457
Feels that way to me.

16:53.490 --> 16:55.493
All right, let's dig into this Andre.

16:55.527 --> 16:57.362
See if he's connected to someone who has

16:57.394 --> 17:01.465
- a grudge against Al.
- Yeah.

17:01.498 --> 17:03.100
- Hey, Kim?
- Yeah?

17:03.133 --> 17:04.896
Um,

17:05.231 --> 17:08.240
whenever you're ready, if you can,

17:08.872 --> 17:12.521
will you get a box together?
Get Al's stuff.

17:15.146 --> 17:18.281
Whenever you're ready, okay?

17:27.391 --> 17:29.326
That was a hell of a thing, Olinsky.

17:29.359 --> 17:32.397
Dumb bastard could be playing
nine holes in Tucson right now.

17:32.429 --> 17:35.432
Instead, he's on a slab in
the medical examiner's office.

17:35.465 --> 17:38.869
Yeah, you just don't see that
kind of loyalty anymore, huh?

17:38.903 --> 17:42.007
These days, most guys flip
before you even say hello.

17:42.040 --> 17:43.908
Yeah, well, considering
how things turned out,

17:43.942 --> 17:46.912
maybe he should've been
just a little bit less loyal.

17:48.413 --> 17:50.882
So what the hell happens now?

17:50.915 --> 17:53.118
Without Olinsky,
I think we should go back

17:53.150 --> 17:55.085
and try to build a case against Voight.

17:55.118 --> 17:57.137
Well, that's what we've been
trying to do for the last year.

17:57.162 --> 17:58.287
Relax, Denny, all right?

17:58.312 --> 18:01.892
I'm just trying to tell you
what I think our next move is.

18:04.596 --> 18:06.198
So what do we have?

18:06.231 --> 18:08.099
Not much.

18:08.131 --> 18:10.936
All the evidence we have
is circumstantial.

18:10.968 --> 18:12.303
I'm just... I'm chasing it, all right?

18:12.337 --> 18:14.004
I just need a little bit
of time to think it through.

18:14.038 --> 18:17.175
- I got a potential witness.
- A witness?

18:17.207 --> 18:19.577
Yeah, some lady says that she saw

18:19.610 --> 18:24.181
Bingham and Voight together
the night of the murder.

18:24.215 --> 18:27.051
- And she's coming forward now?
- Mm-hmm.

18:27.084 --> 18:28.619
How come?

18:28.653 --> 18:30.922
I don't know.
I haven't talked to her yet.

18:30.955 --> 18:34.126
I'm gonna meet with her tomorrow.

18:41.198 --> 18:43.133
You got a name and number
for this witness?

18:43.166 --> 18:46.338
Nope, not a good idea.
Let me talk to her first.

18:46.370 --> 18:48.372
I want her name and number now.

18:52.377 --> 18:54.311
I-I was...

18:54.345 --> 18:56.181
I was hanging out with Bingham, right?

18:56.214 --> 18:57.448
We were at his house.

18:57.482 --> 18:59.885
You two were in a relationship?

18:59.917 --> 19:01.485
Here and there.

19:01.519 --> 19:05.991
- It wasn't much.
- Okay, keep going.

19:06.023 --> 19:09.561
Me and Kevin were just getting stoned.

19:09.593 --> 19:12.062
And all of a sudden,
someone kicks in the door.

19:12.096 --> 19:14.599
Right, and this cop comes in,
grabs Kevin by the hair,

19:14.631 --> 19:16.066
and drags him outside.

19:16.099 --> 19:17.601
How do you know it was a cop?

19:17.635 --> 19:19.271
So I saw his picture on the news.

19:19.303 --> 19:23.007
He's the one whose son
got murdered a while back.

19:28.646 --> 19:31.515
Is this the man you saw?

19:31.549 --> 19:34.686
That's him.

19:34.718 --> 19:38.055
His name's Voight.

19:38.089 --> 19:42.193
So what happened after
he dragged Kevin outside?

19:42.493 --> 19:44.600
I'm not sure.

19:47.331 --> 19:49.037
I didn't look.

19:51.168 --> 19:53.338
How come you didn't report this earlier?

19:53.370 --> 19:55.607
'Cause I was afraid.

19:55.639 --> 19:58.310
That cop said if I opened
my mouth, he'd kill me.

19:58.342 --> 20:01.238
- But you're not afraid now?
- I didn't say that.

20:02.714 --> 20:04.980
I'm confused.

20:05.677 --> 20:07.855
All right, look.

20:08.453 --> 20:10.411
Truth is,

20:11.155 --> 20:13.887
I sort of forgot about what happened.

20:14.257 --> 20:16.122
I moved on.

20:16.394 --> 20:18.063
But then, I saw on the news

20:18.096 --> 20:21.700
that they arrested some
other cop for Kevin's murder.

20:21.733 --> 20:24.502
Reminded me of what I saw.

20:24.534 --> 20:26.670
It made me realize that I was

20:26.704 --> 20:30.308
sitting on some pretty
valuable information.

20:30.340 --> 20:33.610
So I thought it made sense
for me to talk to someone.

20:33.644 --> 20:35.680
You know, find out how much
it may be worth.

20:35.713 --> 20:38.116
That is not how this works, all right?

20:38.148 --> 20:41.386
There's no money involved here.

20:41.418 --> 20:45.572
Yeah, well, look, I'm broke.

20:45.756 --> 20:48.058
I got no job. I got no insurance.

20:48.091 --> 20:51.263
So I don't really care
about any of that.

20:55.551 --> 20:59.215
If you want my help, price is 20 grand.

21:09.600 --> 21:11.614
So, we got anything yet?

21:11.639 --> 21:13.849
We're doing a deep dive
into Al's old cases.

21:13.874 --> 21:15.982
Everyone he's ever arrested so far,

21:16.007 --> 21:17.249
they've got one thing in common.

21:17.305 --> 21:19.530
There's no connection
whatsoever to Andre Gomez.

21:19.555 --> 21:21.592
All right, so what else
do we know about this punk?

21:21.624 --> 21:23.026
Sarge, I think we got something.

21:23.060 --> 21:24.895
Andre had two visitors
last week at Cook County...

21:24.928 --> 21:26.309
his mother and his lawyer.

21:26.380 --> 21:28.283
His lawyer's name is Fidel Castro.

21:28.315 --> 21:29.340
Obviously the name's bogus.

21:29.365 --> 21:31.201
- Okay, facial rec?
- Nothing yet.

21:31.234 --> 21:32.735
Well, we got any leads on this guy?

21:32.760 --> 21:34.822
Yeah, Andre made two phone
calls the day he was meeting

21:34.854 --> 21:36.591
with Fidel, and they were
both to a cell phone

21:36.623 --> 21:37.924
registered to an Alberto Flores.

21:37.957 --> 21:39.057
I'll work on getting it pinged.

21:39.082 --> 21:41.456
Okay, you and Antonio.
Ruzek, you ride with me.

21:41.481 --> 21:42.900
Keeping digging.

21:42.925 --> 21:44.461
Chicago PD!

21:44.493 --> 21:47.363
Alberto Flores!

21:47.396 --> 21:48.932
Nope.

21:48.964 --> 21:50.833
Come here.

21:50.867 --> 21:52.838
Get up.

21:53.235 --> 21:54.670
All right, we're good.
We got it from here.

21:54.704 --> 21:55.768
You sure? We can take him.

21:55.793 --> 21:57.760
Yeah, we're good.

21:58.607 --> 22:00.877
Yo, what did I even do, man?
What's going on, man?

22:00.902 --> 22:02.854
You visited Andre Gomez
in prison, right?

22:02.878 --> 22:04.213
I don't even know who that is.

22:04.246 --> 22:06.448
No? No? Who's this?

22:06.482 --> 22:08.718
Who is this? Is that you, Alberto?

22:08.751 --> 22:10.520
Signed in under Fidel Castro?

22:10.552 --> 22:12.955
What'd you talk about?

22:12.989 --> 22:15.517
- Cuba.
- Cuba?

22:16.259 --> 22:18.361
- Who you working for?
- Nobody.

22:18.394 --> 22:19.628
That's the wrong answer.

22:26.368 --> 22:28.478
Hey, look at me.

22:29.672 --> 22:32.242
Did you tell Andre Gomez
to kill someone?

22:32.274 --> 22:34.409
Yes or no.

22:34.944 --> 22:36.917
Yes or no?

22:37.512 --> 22:38.747
Yeah.

22:38.780 --> 22:40.584
Are you working with anyone else?

22:40.617 --> 22:42.484
No, no, no, just me.

22:42.518 --> 22:44.921
You're a small-time punk, Alberto.

22:44.954 --> 22:48.390
You don't have 5K
to pay off a prison guard.

22:48.424 --> 22:50.260
That means you're lying.

22:52.462 --> 22:55.265
That's strike one.
Now, who you working with?

22:55.298 --> 22:56.399
No one, just me...

22:59.335 --> 23:01.938
Strike two. One more.

23:01.971 --> 23:04.574
I can't, he'll kill me.

23:04.607 --> 23:06.242
What do you think I'm gonna do?

23:06.275 --> 23:07.977
- Huh?
- No.

23:08.011 --> 23:10.413
Last chance, Alberto.

23:10.445 --> 23:12.249
No, wait, wait, wait! Okay, okay!

23:12.281 --> 23:13.449
Please, please.

23:13.482 --> 23:15.318
His name is Carlos DeLeon, okay?

23:15.350 --> 23:17.175
Carlos DeLeon!

23:18.988 --> 23:20.800
Take him.

23:22.959 --> 23:26.296
Got him... Carlos DeLeon washes
money for the Cali Cartel.

23:26.329 --> 23:27.630
Runs the cash through

23:27.664 --> 23:28.964
a legit furniture business that he owns.

23:28.998 --> 23:30.567
The feds have been after him for years,

23:30.599 --> 23:32.002
but this guy's made of Teflon.

23:32.034 --> 23:34.737
- Any connection to Olinsky?
- Nothing yet, Sarge.

23:34.771 --> 23:36.572
I was just talking
to an agent at the DEA.

23:36.606 --> 23:39.041
It turns out, Al got loaned out
to a DEA task force years back.

23:39.075 --> 23:42.479
- The target was Carlos DeLeon.
- It was a federal case.

23:42.511 --> 23:43.713
That's why it's not in our files.

23:43.745 --> 23:44.980
So why the grudge against Olinsky?

23:45.013 --> 23:46.582
His little brother
got popped for speeding.

23:46.616 --> 23:48.318
He had a load of guns in the car.

23:48.350 --> 23:49.785
The feds lock him up and try
to give him the flip on Carlos.

23:49.819 --> 23:51.521
That sounds like business as usual.

23:51.553 --> 23:55.724
It was until little bro
gets killed in jail.

23:55.758 --> 23:58.595
So Al gets made in jail.

23:58.627 --> 24:02.299
Somehow, word gets back to DeLeon,

24:02.331 --> 24:05.668
and DeLeon orders a hit
on Al to get revenge.

24:07.970 --> 24:11.008
Let's grab this guy now.

24:37.399 --> 24:38.967
Hit it.

24:39.001 --> 24:40.770
Chicago PD!

24:40.802 --> 24:42.504
- What do you want?
- Carlos DeLeon!

24:42.538 --> 24:43.940
- He's not here.
- Where is he?

24:43.973 --> 24:45.709
- He's not here.
- Where is he?

24:45.742 --> 24:47.077
You can't come in my house
without a search warrant...

24:47.109 --> 24:49.346
Right here,
signed by Judge Thomas Wells.

24:49.378 --> 24:51.947
Well, your husband, Carlos...
where is he?

24:51.981 --> 24:53.950
I told you, he's not here.

24:53.982 --> 24:55.652
Hey, I just found her
in the back, Sergeant.

24:55.684 --> 24:57.520
I don't know if she
speaks English or not.

24:57.552 --> 25:00.389
What's your name? Tu nombre.

25:00.423 --> 25:02.759
- Susana.
- <i>Cállate!</i>

25:02.791 --> 25:04.694
She's my mother.
Now get your hands off of her.

25:04.726 --> 25:06.362
There's men's clothes in the suitcase

25:06.396 --> 25:07.664
on the floor in the bedroom.

25:07.696 --> 25:09.131
Looks like someone left in a hurry.

25:09.165 --> 25:11.401
All right, where'd he go?

25:11.434 --> 25:12.668
Mexico?

25:12.702 --> 25:14.404
My husband travels for business.

25:14.436 --> 25:15.704
He sells furniture.

25:15.738 --> 25:18.842
Your husband launders money
for the cartel,

25:18.875 --> 25:22.645
and he ordered the murder of
a Chicago police officer.

25:22.677 --> 25:24.481
So you got one chance to cooperate.

25:24.513 --> 25:27.416
Or what? You gonna hit me?

25:27.450 --> 25:30.420
Sarge, we got this.

25:30.453 --> 25:32.541
Let Hailey and I talk to her.

25:33.489 --> 25:35.416
That's a good idea.

25:37.025 --> 25:39.428
- Tear this place apart.
- Come on.

25:39.462 --> 25:42.565
- Come with me.
- Go.

25:42.598 --> 25:43.899
Come on, Carmen, you knew the day

25:43.933 --> 25:45.702
you married Carlos
this moment was coming.

25:45.734 --> 25:47.404
Play it right, you walk,
play it wrong, you...

25:47.436 --> 25:48.670
My husband sells furniture.

25:48.704 --> 25:50.139
Now get the hell out of my face.

25:50.173 --> 25:51.907
You listen to me, you bitch.

25:51.941 --> 25:53.877
Your husband killed my partner.
Do you understand?

25:53.909 --> 25:55.611
So either you help me here and now,

25:55.645 --> 25:58.848
- or I will bury your ass.
- I'm calling my lawyer.

25:58.880 --> 26:00.582
They call him "The Shark."

26:00.616 --> 26:01.984
He'll make your life a living hell.

26:02.018 --> 26:03.420
Call him.

26:07.056 --> 26:08.889
- Uh-uh-uh, she stays.
- For God's sake, leave her alone.

26:08.914 --> 26:10.860
Oh, I will. I need her papers first.

26:10.893 --> 26:12.003
She has nothing to do with this.

26:12.028 --> 26:14.816
- Papers now.
- Look at this text.

26:15.897 --> 26:18.834
Okay. We ran your mother's name.

26:18.867 --> 26:20.470
Seems she doesn't exist.

26:20.502 --> 26:22.137
I'm guessing she's here illegally.

26:22.171 --> 26:24.174
One call to ICE and she's gone.

26:24.206 --> 26:26.775
Slow train back to Mexico, Carmen.

26:26.809 --> 26:28.778
It's a real easy choice...
your sweet, loving mother...

26:28.810 --> 26:30.146
Or your scumbag murdering husband.

26:30.178 --> 26:34.450
Who's going to prison
for the rest of his life.

26:34.483 --> 26:37.119
Last chance.

26:37.153 --> 26:40.123
Where is he?

26:40.155 --> 26:42.893
Where is he?

26:45.060 --> 26:47.730
Ramon picked him up about an hour ago.

26:47.762 --> 26:50.165
- Who's Ramon?
- Carlos' cousin.

26:50.198 --> 26:53.035
- They're at his warehouse.
- There you go.

26:53.069 --> 26:54.636
- If you're lying...
- I'm not.

26:54.669 --> 26:57.873
So go. Do what you gotta do.

27:07.683 --> 27:09.001
Hold.

27:10.720 --> 27:12.055
All right, Atwater, Antonio with me.

27:12.088 --> 27:14.691
You guys go right. Let's move.

27:33.842 --> 27:36.579
- Go.
- Moving.

27:44.553 --> 27:46.588
You guys ready? Ready.

27:48.790 --> 27:51.293
Chicago PD!

27:54.129 --> 27:55.764
Behind you.

27:55.798 --> 27:59.002
- Let's go, Burgess.
- Yep.

28:18.788 --> 28:20.323
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

28:20.356 --> 28:21.857
He's still alive. Go.

28:31.232 --> 28:34.002
Where'd it come from?
Where, where, where?

28:34.036 --> 28:35.604
Go.

28:43.945 --> 28:45.180
Sarge, you see something?

28:45.213 --> 28:47.082
You go that way. I'm going here.

28:47.116 --> 28:50.954
- Oh, wait, I was...
- It's an order.

29:10.405 --> 29:12.709
Carlos DeLeon.

29:12.742 --> 29:13.943
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

29:13.975 --> 29:15.177
I don't have a gun.

29:15.211 --> 29:17.814
Drop the bag.

29:17.847 --> 29:19.182
Drop it!

29:19.214 --> 29:21.083
Okay, okay, okay. I don't have a gun.

29:21.117 --> 29:24.319
Get your hands above your head.

29:24.352 --> 29:27.222
Listen, there's 400 grand
in that bag, maybe more.

29:27.255 --> 29:30.192
- Shut up.
- Just take it.

29:30.225 --> 29:32.395
- Shut up!
- No one's gonna know.

29:32.427 --> 29:35.846
- Just take it.
- Get your hands over your head!

29:39.135 --> 29:41.204
Please, don't shoot me.

29:41.236 --> 29:45.173
Alvin Olinsky was my best friend.

29:45.206 --> 29:48.143
Please, please.

29:48.176 --> 29:50.980
- Get on your knees.
- Don't shoot me.

29:51.012 --> 29:54.216
- Don't shoot me...
- Get on your knees!

30:02.925 --> 30:05.261
Hank, you okay?

30:05.293 --> 30:07.062
What happened?

30:07.096 --> 30:10.032
He's got a gun in his
waistband he was reaching for.

30:20.742 --> 30:24.112
Yo, what the hell, man?
You just killed that dude!

30:24.146 --> 30:27.149
He had his hands up.
You shot his ass anyway.

30:27.183 --> 30:30.153
I saw the whole thing.
You shot him in cold blood.

30:30.185 --> 30:33.956
You got no right to do that!
No right at all!

30:44.364 --> 30:46.804
Hey, what happened out there?

30:46.851 --> 30:48.255
This witness is all over the news

30:48.309 --> 30:49.457
saying DeLeon's hands were up high?

30:49.482 --> 30:50.917
Yeah, is he telling the truth?

30:50.951 --> 30:52.211
I don't know. I didn't see it.

30:52.236 --> 30:55.000
I got to the scene
right after Voight opened fire.

30:55.054 --> 30:56.555
Press about to go crazy over this.

30:56.589 --> 30:58.586
Yeah, this is not
a good look for Voight.

30:58.611 --> 31:00.532
I get it, but I mean...

31:00.557 --> 31:02.794
But what?

31:02.826 --> 31:05.229
There's nothing I can do.
I wasn't there,

31:05.262 --> 31:07.331
so I can't confirm or deny if
Carlos reached for his weap...

31:07.364 --> 31:09.771
You can't confirm or deny?
What, are you a lawyer?

31:09.796 --> 31:11.467
- I didn't see what happened.
- It doesn't matter.

31:11.492 --> 31:12.851
- Who cares?
- Excuse me?

31:12.876 --> 31:14.639
We're talking about
the guy who killed Al here.

31:14.671 --> 31:17.240
We're talking about a career
criminal who paid some punk

31:17.265 --> 31:19.344
to kill our friend, our brother,

31:19.376 --> 31:21.278
and you're worried about
what you saw or didn't see?

31:21.312 --> 31:23.181
- I don't understand.
- Watch yourself.

31:23.213 --> 31:24.381
- Watch myself? I'm right here.
- All right, enough!

31:24.414 --> 31:25.782
- Not today.
- What is going on?

31:25.815 --> 31:27.818
We're good.

31:27.852 --> 31:30.822
We're just talking over a few things.

31:30.854 --> 31:33.525
Antonio,

31:33.557 --> 31:35.259
Ivory Tower called.

31:35.293 --> 31:37.428
They wanna talk to you about
the Carlos DeLeon shooting.

31:37.460 --> 31:39.697
Now.

32:21.739 --> 32:24.808
<i>In the course of pursuit,
I managed to trap the offender</i>

32:24.842 --> 32:27.412
<i>on the roof of this warehouse.</i>

32:27.444 --> 32:29.947
And I ordered the offender
to raise his hands

32:29.980 --> 32:32.749
above his head, get down on his knees.

32:32.783 --> 32:35.920
He refused to comply with my order.

32:35.952 --> 32:40.490
And he reached into
his waistband for a handgun.

32:40.524 --> 32:42.493
At this point, I was afraid for my life,

32:42.526 --> 32:45.697
so I fired one shot, center mass.

32:45.729 --> 32:47.966
Offender went down.

32:47.998 --> 32:51.635
And on the ground he reached
again for his handgun,

32:51.669 --> 32:55.506
so I fired a second lethal
round through his heart.

32:55.684 --> 32:58.653
And that's it. That's what happened.

32:59.677 --> 33:01.913
Anything else you'd like to add?

33:01.946 --> 33:03.781
Yeah, it was... it was a good shoot.

33:03.814 --> 33:05.516
I mean, I did what I had to do.

33:05.548 --> 33:07.985
Simple as that.

33:21.931 --> 33:23.334
You're late.

33:23.366 --> 33:24.935
Why'd you change
the location three times?

33:24.969 --> 33:26.571
Don't worry about it.
Let me see your phone.

33:26.604 --> 33:27.838
- What?
- I said,

33:27.872 --> 33:31.308
- give me your damn phone.
- Why?

33:31.342 --> 33:33.411
I wanna see who you've been talking to.

33:33.443 --> 33:36.093
Necklace, off, in this bag right now.

33:36.118 --> 33:38.195
The hell are you doing?

33:42.018 --> 33:44.288
- Just being cautious.
- You mean disrespectful.

33:44.322 --> 33:46.958
When you ask for money,
the rules change, sweetie.

33:46.990 --> 33:48.526
That's just the way it is.

33:48.558 --> 33:51.102
Anything else you wanna check?

34:00.738 --> 34:03.696
Nah, we're good.

34:03.774 --> 34:05.008
You want the money, you need to make

34:05.042 --> 34:07.312
a few adjustments to your testimony.

34:07.344 --> 34:09.880
You didn't just see Voight
and Bingham leave the house.

34:09.913 --> 34:12.315
You saw Voight put a pistol to his head,

34:12.350 --> 34:13.818
throw him in the trunk of the car,

34:13.851 --> 34:15.652
and say, "It's time for you to pay

34:15.686 --> 34:17.954
for what you did to my son."

34:17.987 --> 34:21.558
- You want me to lie?
- You want the 20 grand?

34:23.460 --> 34:25.963
Yeah, sure, fine.
I'll say whatever you want.

34:25.996 --> 34:27.398
All right, good.

34:27.431 --> 34:28.833
I'll set up a meeting
with the prosecutor

34:28.864 --> 34:30.034
first thing in the morning.

34:30.065 --> 34:32.003
You tell them exactly what you told me,

34:32.036 --> 34:35.005
plus the new details we talked about.

34:35.039 --> 34:36.904
Okay.

34:39.641 --> 34:41.813
You get 10 grand now,

34:41.844 --> 34:44.389
10 grand after you testify.

34:48.132 --> 34:51.820
- Yeah, whatever, man. That's cool.
- Yeah, have a nice day.

34:57.094 --> 34:59.517
Hank, it's me.

35:00.398 --> 35:03.568
We need to talk in private.

35:05.469 --> 35:07.751
Come on in. Drink?

35:08.505 --> 35:09.810
No thanks.

35:11.876 --> 35:13.575
Okay.

35:15.679 --> 35:17.081
I'll cut to it.

35:21.485 --> 35:24.055
We have a witness that
put you and Bingham together

35:24.088 --> 35:26.791
the night of the murder.

35:26.824 --> 35:29.559
And it, uh, might just be the straw

35:29.592 --> 35:32.563
that breaks old Hank Voight's back.

35:37.735 --> 35:39.771
Maybe I will take one of those bourbons,

35:39.804 --> 35:41.497
if you're still offering.

35:48.711 --> 35:50.726
How'd things get so crazy,

35:50.947 --> 35:52.851
you and me?

35:58.088 --> 36:00.562
Man, we were partners.

36:01.891 --> 36:04.053
Friends.

36:04.128 --> 36:06.164
You came after me.

36:06.197 --> 36:08.936
You left me no choice.

36:09.069 --> 36:10.899
Denny, you crossed the line.

36:10.936 --> 36:13.315
What, once in 32 years?

36:13.536 --> 36:15.104
Denny...

36:16.639 --> 36:19.705
You planted a gun on an innocent man.

36:20.677 --> 36:23.847
That's not something I can abide.

36:23.880 --> 36:26.817
Not something you can abide?

36:26.851 --> 36:28.619
Just who the hell are you?

36:28.652 --> 36:33.858
Dirtiest damn cop in Chicago to
abide or not abide my actions.

36:33.891 --> 36:36.527
I'm not dirty.

36:36.559 --> 36:38.595
I don't hurt innocent people.

36:38.628 --> 36:41.665
I never did. I never will.

36:41.699 --> 36:44.668
Is that a joke?

36:52.108 --> 36:54.545
You don't get it, do you?

36:55.713 --> 36:58.115
After all this time.

36:58.148 --> 36:59.784
Get what?

36:59.816 --> 37:04.563
The difference between
dirty and necessary.

37:07.057 --> 37:09.141
That, like it or not,

37:09.659 --> 37:13.530
you and all your self-righteous
friends in the Ivory Tower,

37:13.563 --> 37:16.833
you need people like me
out on the streets,

37:16.867 --> 37:21.773
doing the things regular cops
are unwilling to do,

37:23.206 --> 37:25.909
going the extra mile

37:25.943 --> 37:28.520
to make sure the truly evil,

37:28.945 --> 37:31.606
the truly dangerous,

37:33.016 --> 37:34.997
go away.

37:36.686 --> 37:40.691
I thin the herd for the greater good.

37:44.260 --> 37:46.931
Well, I thin the herd, too,

37:46.963 --> 37:49.933
getting rid of cowboy cops.

37:49.967 --> 37:52.936
I just want to make Chicago
a better place to live.

37:52.970 --> 37:55.139
No.

37:55.171 --> 37:57.108
You don't give a damn about Chicago.

37:57.141 --> 37:58.675
You never did.

37:58.708 --> 38:01.545
You care about you, Denny Woods.

38:02.278 --> 38:05.137
That's what this is really about...

38:05.615 --> 38:06.942
You...

38:07.284 --> 38:09.987
your ego, your ambition.

38:13.057 --> 38:14.692
- You know what's crazy?
- Hmm.

38:14.724 --> 38:18.929
I mean, despite all that's happened...

38:18.963 --> 38:21.198
I still love you, Hank.

38:21.231 --> 38:24.569
Damn if I know why, but I do.

38:25.836 --> 38:29.941
That's why I am willing to
offer you a deal.

38:30.840 --> 38:34.144
Now, you confess to killing Bingham,

38:34.177 --> 38:37.714
we'll plead you down to manslaughter.

38:37.748 --> 38:40.251
You'll do five years, maybe seven.

38:50.628 --> 38:52.597
Tell me about this witness you found.

38:52.630 --> 38:56.901
Aw, now you know I cannot do that.

38:58.692 --> 39:00.643
Is she credible?

39:01.704 --> 39:03.335
"She"?

39:04.407 --> 39:07.344
Name's Kate, right?

39:09.912 --> 39:13.351
You gave her 20 grand...
10 now, 10 later?

39:17.054 --> 39:19.624
Bribing a witness...

39:19.657 --> 39:21.258
That's a serious crime.

39:21.291 --> 39:23.928
You son of a bitch.

39:23.961 --> 39:28.633
You left me no choice.

39:28.666 --> 39:31.168
I had to give that tape
to Internal Affairs.

39:31.200 --> 39:35.338
<i>Chicago PD!</i>

39:38.374 --> 39:40.878
It's over, Denny.

39:45.349 --> 39:46.917
Sir, I'm gonna need you to stand up.

39:46.949 --> 39:49.919
I'm gonna need your gun and your badge.

40:34.398 --> 40:37.233
You pulled it off.

40:37.266 --> 40:39.436
Yeah, he couldn't help himself.

40:39.470 --> 40:42.707
Son of a bitch had it coming.

40:42.740 --> 40:45.075
Listen, I appreciate
what you did, Jimmy.

40:46.943 --> 40:49.214
You too, Kate.

40:49.979 --> 40:54.251
Hey, I meant what I said about Al.

40:54.284 --> 40:56.086
I'm truly sorry.

40:56.119 --> 40:58.422
He was one of a kind.

41:00.798 --> 41:02.522
Yeah.

41:23.829 --> 41:25.970
I'm sorry, Al.

41:27.016 --> 41:29.119
So sorry...
