01:21.706 --> 01:24.167
I went through two boxes
of tissues, goddamn you.

01:24.250 --> 01:27.462
I'm sorry about that,
but I am relieved.

01:27.545 --> 01:30.799
Your message was so cryptic,
I was afraid you hated it.

01:30.882 --> 01:34.928
I loved it!
I had to tell you in person,
so you could see this.

01:35.011 --> 01:37.847
-(chuckles)
-I wanna fast-track it
for the Christmas season.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.225
Oh my gosh.
Oh, that's great.

01:40.308 --> 01:42.560
-I just have one note.
-Okay.

01:42.644 --> 01:47.816
This whole thing is...
so raw and honest,

01:47.899 --> 01:50.276
and, let's face it, brutal.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.903
I mean, you spend
your whole career

01:51.986 --> 01:54.197
writing about
your quest for love,

01:54.280 --> 01:56.574
and then,
you finally find it...

01:56.658 --> 01:58.701
and then he dies.

01:58.785 --> 02:01.788
It's pretty dark.
It's a real departure
for you as a writer.

02:01.871 --> 02:02.163
Well...

02:04.123 --> 02:07.877
that's what happened...
He departed.

02:07.961 --> 02:11.840
But, you're known for
writing "Sex and the City."

02:11.923 --> 02:13.424
I'm afraid if we
publish this as is,

02:13.508 --> 02:15.343
your readers are gonna pitch
themselves out the window

02:15.426 --> 02:16.261
clutching their tubs
of Häagen-Dazs.

02:16.344 --> 02:20.390
Oh, well, that is
certainly not what I want.

02:20.473 --> 02:21.891
No. (laughs)

02:21.975 --> 02:24.894
I would love, and I think
this is very doable,

02:24.978 --> 02:27.814
if you could give
the reader some
element of hope.

02:27.897 --> 02:32.193
-Hm.
-Amanda: Just a suggestion
of a brighter future.

02:32.277 --> 02:34.904
I mean, for example...
I imagine, at some point,

02:34.988 --> 02:37.907
you're gonna start
dating again, right?

02:39.492 --> 02:40.410
Um, I--

02:40.493 --> 02:43.538
I, I mean, I'm not even
thinking about that yet.

02:43.621 --> 02:45.081
I hear you...

02:45.164 --> 02:48.334
but... if there's
a tiny part of you

02:48.418 --> 02:52.422
that's open to the idea
of even just one date...

02:52.505 --> 02:55.717
it would be great
if it could happen
in the next few weeks.

02:55.800 --> 02:59.345
I would love to hit that
stocking stuffer deadline.

03:00.763 --> 03:02.557
Uh, you want me
to go on a date?

03:02.640 --> 03:04.434
Ooh, just to be clear,
I am just talking about

03:04.517 --> 03:07.395
a toe dip into
the dating pool.
One guy.

03:07.478 --> 03:08.897
It doesn't have
to be a whole chapter.

03:08.980 --> 03:11.608
It could just be
an epilogue.

03:11.691 --> 03:14.110
A single page,
half a page.

03:14.193 --> 03:17.780
Just... lookin' for
that glimmer of hope.

03:18.156 --> 03:19.365
Okay.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.744
Charlotte:
I'm here, I'm here.

03:22.827 --> 03:23.786
Sorry.
Sorry I'm late,

03:23.870 --> 03:24.996
but I have good news.

03:25.079 --> 03:26.623
Carrie agreed to be
an auction item

03:26.706 --> 03:29.083
at the school benefit.

03:29.167 --> 03:31.753
-Sorry, it took so long.
-No, that's great.

03:31.836 --> 03:33.296
I'm sorry if I was
being pushy about it.

03:33.379 --> 03:35.465
The benefit committee's
just all over me to get

03:35.548 --> 03:36.966
more flashy auction items.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.344
Oh, and remember,
for this match,

03:39.427 --> 03:40.303
the redhead is
deadly at the net.

03:40.386 --> 03:42.931
Right, and the other one
has that killer serve.

03:43.014 --> 03:43.973
I could barely
return it last time.

I said I would be.

No! That's the bad vegetable

farthest from our house

04:52.917 --> 04:54.711
with the squash...
opposite end.

04:54.794 --> 04:57.296
Steve, can you hear me?

04:59.340 --> 05:01.009
Just find me, okay?!

05:03.136 --> 05:05.680
Hi, um, what are
the green ones called?

05:05.763 --> 05:08.891
Miranda Hobbes, you are
failing heirloom tomatoes.

05:08.975 --> 05:12.186
-Oh my god! Hi!
-Dr. Wallace: Hi! Ha, ha.

05:12.270 --> 05:14.772
Okay, I never wanted
you two to meet,
but here we are,

05:14.856 --> 05:16.899
so, Miranda Hobbes,
this is my husband,

05:16.983 --> 05:18.401
-Andre Rashad.
-Miranda: Hey.

05:18.484 --> 05:20.403
-Andre, this is Miranda.
-Hey, nice to meet the woman

05:20.486 --> 05:22.530
-that beat up Chucky
in the subway.
-Oh.

05:22.613 --> 05:24.157
Yeah, I hear things.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.075
It's my greatest
accomplishment.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.327
I, I am still having
nightmares, though.

05:28.411 --> 05:29.412
(laughing)

05:29.495 --> 05:31.247
Hey, should I run over
to the cheese woman?

05:31.330 --> 05:33.124
-I want to stay ahead of
a dangerous cheese shortage.
-Oh.

05:33.207 --> 05:35.334
He's not tryin'
to impress you.

05:35.418 --> 05:36.836
He really
is this cute.

05:37.837 --> 05:39.130
Be right back.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.260
Oh my god.
That kiss.

05:44.343 --> 05:47.972
If you two were a TV show,
I would be streaming you.

05:48.056 --> 05:50.683
Oh, well, it
would be a drama

05:50.767 --> 05:52.769
'cause I got
my period this morning.

05:52.852 --> 05:55.855
Oh shit.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear.

05:55.938 --> 05:58.274
Yeah, we're still,
you know, off the IVF,

05:58.357 --> 06:01.360
but trying, and I was
almost two weeks late.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.905
-Mm.
-I shouldn't have told him.

06:03.988 --> 06:05.323
I mean, the man is good
at a lot of things,

06:05.406 --> 06:08.618
but cautious optimism
is not one of them.

06:08.701 --> 06:11.662
(sighs) I am dreading
telling him, Miranda.

06:11.746 --> 06:13.790
I am so done
with all of this.

06:13.873 --> 06:15.792
Steve:
Hey...

06:15.875 --> 06:16.667
This place is bullshit.

06:16.751 --> 06:19.128
Why do they keep movin'
everything around?

06:19.212 --> 06:22.757
Oh, Steve, Steve,
this is, uh, Nya,
my professor.

06:22.840 --> 06:25.384
-Dr. Wallace: Hey.
-I have been dying to meet you.

06:25.468 --> 06:28.596
You are the only person
I know who intimidates her.

06:28.679 --> 06:31.974
-(all laughing)
-I think we intimidate
each other, actually.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.185
Steve:
Ah, my wallet! Shit!

06:34.268 --> 06:36.896
You know, y-you got me
so freakin' distracted

06:36.979 --> 06:38.689
when you're yellin' at me
about the squash guy,

06:38.773 --> 06:41.984
I left my, I left my wallet
over where the pickle guy

06:42.068 --> 06:44.737
who used to be over
in that corner.

06:44.821 --> 06:45.822
I, I gotta,
I gotta go get it.

06:45.905 --> 06:49.158
Um, really nice to meet you,
Professor, all right?

06:49.242 --> 06:49.450
-Oh, sorry.
-No worries.

06:52.453 --> 06:54.497
So, that's my Steve.

06:54.580 --> 06:57.208
-Here comes my guy,
so would you--
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:57.291 --> 06:59.293
-Got the last of the Bloomsday.
-Miranda: Ooh.

06:59.377 --> 07:00.920
-There we go.
-See?

07:02.755 --> 07:04.549
(up-tempo music playing)

07:06.759 --> 07:08.761
Hi.

07:10.972 --> 07:13.391
Oh, Amanda?

07:13.474 --> 07:16.686
Mm, Carrie. Shit. (laughs)

07:16.769 --> 07:19.313
-Sorry to drop in,
um, unannounced.
-No, no, no. I love it.

07:19.397 --> 07:21.983
You just caught me
with a milk mustache.
I mean, what am I? Five?

07:22.066 --> 07:23.860
This is my fourth
cappuccino today.

07:23.943 --> 07:25.361
I think...
I've lost track.

07:25.444 --> 07:26.571
Come sit with me
while I vibrate.

07:26.654 --> 07:27.822
Oh, do you want one?
They're free.

07:27.905 --> 07:30.074
Oh, no. I'm, I'm good.
Thank you. Thank you.

07:30.158 --> 07:32.702
So... what's up?

07:32.785 --> 07:38.708
Well, um, I, I got
the book cover proposals
that you sent over,

07:38.791 --> 07:40.710
and now, I'm worried.

07:40.793 --> 07:41.544
Oh my god.

07:41.627 --> 07:43.379
I thought the covers
were stunning,

07:43.462 --> 07:49.844
especially number two
and... number five.

07:49.927 --> 07:54.056
So spare and arresting.
Just takes my breath away.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.642
But, maybe,
the book is too heavy.

07:56.726 --> 07:57.727
You know, I mean,
even you said that

07:57.810 --> 07:59.979
my readers don't want
all that sadness from me.

08:00.062 --> 08:02.607
Maybe, I just--

08:02.690 --> 08:05.693
Maybe, I just needed
to write the book for myself.

08:07.236 --> 08:09.405
I respectfully disagree.

08:09.488 --> 08:13.326
In fact, when I pitched
the idea of the epilogue

08:13.409 --> 08:15.745
to Oprah's Book Club people,

08:15.828 --> 08:19.916
they got very excited,
and said they were
definitely interested.

08:19.999 --> 08:23.377
-Oprah? Really?
-Mmm-hmm.

08:23.461 --> 08:26.756
-So, I guess
I'm goin' on a date.
-(Charlotte gasps)

08:26.839 --> 08:29.091
I've been waiting
for you to be ready.

08:29.175 --> 08:31.761
We had this whole
wave of divorces
at school this year,

08:31.844 --> 08:36.474
and I know three
adorable dads who'll be
fighting over you.

08:36.557 --> 08:37.725
Well, I'm not
exactly ready.

08:37.808 --> 08:39.477
It was mandated
by my editor...

08:40.727 --> 08:41.270
and Oprah.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.272
-Really?
-Seriously?

08:43.356 --> 08:46.275
Well, when Oprah
mandates a man date,

08:46.359 --> 08:48.402
-what're you gonna do?
-Date a man.

08:48.486 --> 08:52.198
-(laughs) Yeah.
-And I thought about it,
and I figured...

08:52.281 --> 08:56.786
-if I can lighten my hair,
I can lighten my book, right?
-Charlotte: Yes.

08:56.869 --> 08:59.247
Oh, and they're all
gonna be at the benefit,

08:59.330 --> 09:00.915
so you can meet them there.

09:00.998 --> 09:02.458
No one anyone knows.

09:02.541 --> 09:04.293
You know,
I'd rather, I'd rather

09:04.377 --> 09:05.461
go the anonymous route,

09:05.544 --> 09:06.921
since this is,
basically, a stunt,

09:07.004 --> 09:09.966
you know, to give my, my
readers a glimmer of hope.

09:10.049 --> 09:12.301
Is there an app
that knocks you out

09:12.385 --> 09:13.928
while they post
your photos,

09:14.011 --> 09:14.762
fill out those questionnaires,

09:14.845 --> 09:17.056
and, oh my god,
I'm gonna be sick.

09:17.139 --> 09:19.475
It's already done.
I listed you on
three different sites.

09:19.558 --> 09:21.477
I narrowed it down to one.
I don't want to waste your time.

09:21.560 --> 09:24.272
-When?
-Valentine's Day
on my lunch break.

09:24.355 --> 09:25.982
Nobody buys real estate
in the winter,

09:26.065 --> 09:27.858
so I decided to list you.

09:27.942 --> 09:30.319
You staged me,
like an apartment?

09:30.403 --> 09:32.154
You're doing very well.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.948
There's a lot of buzz.

09:34.031 --> 09:36.909
-Am I?
-Yeah... check it out.

09:36.993 --> 09:39.495
-Let me see, let me see.
-Yeah, let's see!

09:39.578 --> 09:41.289
-(Miranda gasps)
-Charlotte: Oh my.

09:41.372 --> 09:43.332
-I'll date the dog.
-(all laughing)

09:43.416 --> 09:45.960
Well, he's
objectively handsome.

09:46.043 --> 09:47.211
To who?

09:48.087 --> 09:49.922
Why is he chewing
his glasses?

09:50.006 --> 09:53.175
In my experience,
glasses chewers
are good in bed.

09:53.259 --> 09:55.094
Doesn't he look
like he would be?

09:55.177 --> 09:57.346
All right,
no sex for me,
indefinitely.

09:57.430 --> 10:00.349
All I need out
of this is pleasant
enough conversation,

10:00.433 --> 10:02.518
so I can be
a stocking stuffer.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.981
So, no sex for you...
ever?

10:08.441 --> 10:10.526
Well, honestly,
the thought of never
having it again

10:10.609 --> 10:14.780
feels really strange,
but the thought of...

10:16.073 --> 10:17.533
having sex with anyone

10:17.616 --> 10:18.617
other than Big
just makes me...

10:20.953 --> 10:23.414
-sick to my stomach.
-Yeah, makes sense.

10:23.497 --> 10:26.167
But maybe I've had
my share of all that.

10:26.250 --> 10:28.210
You know, when I look
back at my dating life,

10:28.294 --> 10:29.587

a roller coaster,

those old, wooden ones

life-threatening than fun.

Oh, I would kill
to get back on
the roller coaster.

10:40.056 --> 10:42.475
I've been riding
the monorail for too long.

10:43.601 --> 10:45.561
I was hoping things
were better with Steve,

10:45.644 --> 10:46.979
'cause you hadn't
said anything.

10:47.063 --> 10:49.565
No.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.818
As I've always said,
"No news is no news."

what's the lifespan
of an unanswered text?

11:00.618 --> 11:03.204
Three days,
three weeks,
three months?

11:03.287 --> 11:05.748
Three months?
Try three hours.

11:09.585 --> 11:10.669
-Che, huh?
-Yeah.

11:14.423 --> 11:17.468
They never ask about me
at the podcast, do they?

11:19.220 --> 11:22.098
You know,
Che's been back and forth
to L.A. a few times,

11:22.181 --> 11:24.892
and you...
listen to the podcast.

11:24.975 --> 11:28.479
-They ride all the rides.
-(sighs) So...

11:29.772 --> 11:34.068
guess I'll have
to file that away
as a crazy one-off,

11:34.151 --> 11:37.321
and resign myself
to having a dead sex life.

11:38.697 --> 11:41.659
I can't believe
that I had the most

11:41.742 --> 11:42.618
transcendent sex
of my life...

11:44.912 --> 11:46.914

happen again.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.630
But Big is,
actually, dead.

11:56.757 --> 11:59.468
Maybe your sex life
with Steve is...

12:00.386 --> 12:03.472

-Mm.

12:12.898 --> 12:16.152
Since when does
Herbert Wexley
ride the subway?

12:16.235 --> 12:17.486
My guess is
he thinks it'll
boost his street cred

12:17.570 --> 12:20.281
-if he ever runs for mayor.
-Oh!

12:20.364 --> 12:24.160
Anyway, we bonded
over our wives' mutual
tennis addiction.

12:24.243 --> 12:27.538
Oh, that reminds me.
We're actually playing
again tomorrow morning.

12:27.621 --> 12:32.209
-You know...
I'm not half bad at tennis.
-Oh?

-Herbert said he
played in high school.
-Uh-huh.

How come you never
ask the boys to join
for some mixed doubles?

12:38.924 --> 12:42.928
-Never occurred to me.
-Is it occurring to you now?

12:43.012 --> 12:47.224
Harry... would you like
to play some doubles with us?

12:47.308 --> 12:48.684

22:36.313 --> 22:38.315
Lily wants the vintage
sneaker thing.

22:38.398 --> 22:42.110
You guys, I have to
go help Harry, sorry.

22:42.194 --> 22:44.696
What?
Did you hear what you
just said just then?

22:44.780 --> 22:47.282
-What?
-"Sorry." You said "sorry."

22:48.366 --> 22:50.035
How did you shit
yourself on a date?

22:50.118 --> 22:52.162
Oh, good.
We're back here.

22:52.245 --> 22:54.081
Seventh grade.

22:54.164 --> 22:57.167
My parents made me
take Connie Delucca
out for ice cream.

22:57.250 --> 23:00.295
Ten minutes in,
my shorts were filled with
chocolate chocolate chip.

23:01.630 --> 23:05.384
-My body knew.
-Yeah... I still win.

23:05.467 --> 23:09.096
Followed by dessert
at Serendipity.

23:09.179 --> 23:13.308
Yes... so--

23:13.391 --> 23:15.894
And we're gonna start
the bidding at $500,

23:15.977 --> 23:19.314
which... could cover
a single piece of cake there.

23:19.397 --> 23:21.149
(all laughing)

23:21.942 --> 23:22.943
(quietly): Uh...

23:23.610 --> 23:25.779
Ah!

23:25.862 --> 23:26.822
The point is,
it just--

23:26.905 --> 23:27.572
It rolled off
your tongue,

23:27.656 --> 23:29.699
you know,
no big deal, no drama,

23:29.783 --> 23:33.286
so, you know,
why can't it just roll
off your tongue to me?

23:33.370 --> 23:34.579
Because it can't.

23:34.663 --> 23:36.581
Oh, look!
Here are the sneakers.

23:36.665 --> 23:39.417
You have said it
12 times since we
left the house tonight.

23:39.501 --> 23:43.296
-You've been counting?
-I'm a man on a mission.

23:43.380 --> 23:45.173
And the last time
was just a minute ago

23:45.257 --> 23:48.760
to a lady in the lobby
who bumped into you.

23:48.844 --> 23:53.140
Exactly.
Women apologize
to the whole world

23:53.223 --> 23:55.517
all day long
for everything.

23:55.600 --> 23:59.020
Tennis is the one place
that I don't have to do that.

23:59.104 --> 24:01.690
So, as Demi Lovato
would say...

24:01.773 --> 24:04.234
"Sorry... not sorry."

24:08.446 --> 24:10.240
Do they have any couples
counseling sessions

24:10.323 --> 24:11.491
anyone can bid on
anywhere here?

24:13.827 --> 24:16.163
I'm just gonna go back in,
and tell Amanda

24:16.246 --> 24:20.041
I didn't find that
glimmer of hope.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.668
Guess my book's dead, too.

24:23.461 --> 24:27.132
Darn. My sad book
keeps getting sadder.

24:27.215 --> 24:28.675
Speaking of dead things...

24:30.302 --> 24:35.348
I tried to revive my sex life
with Steve the other day.

24:35.432 --> 24:38.059
I, I really tried hard,

24:38.143 --> 24:41.605
and I'm afraid...
the patient is non-responsive.

24:42.731 --> 24:46.568
-So... no pulse?
-No pulse at all.

24:46.651 --> 24:48.904
It was like two dead people

24:48.987 --> 24:51.740
trying to get it on,
like zombie sex.

24:51.823 --> 24:54.868
And you're sure you guys
wouldn't consider going
back to a therapist?

24:54.951 --> 24:57.621
We tried twice.
We don't need a therapist.

24:57.704 --> 24:59.247
We need the cast of
"The Walking Dead."

25:00.582 --> 25:01.750
Listen, before we get
to all of that,

25:01.833 --> 25:05.670
we have a special
treat that we know
you're going to enjoy.

25:05.754 --> 25:09.424
Someone you'll be
grateful to hear is
not the two of us.

25:09.507 --> 25:12.636
-(all laughing)
-Yes, you can see

25:12.719 --> 25:15.972
-this amazing performer--
-Use the mic. I beg of you.

25:16.056 --> 25:19.100
in their Netflix
comedy special
"Check the Box,"

25:19.184 --> 25:21.895
-put your hands
together for Che Diaz!
-Che Diaz!

25:21.978 --> 25:23.521
(cheers and applause)

25:27.525 --> 25:30.237
Hi! Yes, aw!

25:30.320 --> 25:32.155
Uh, you know what?
I'll just take hers.
She's not using it.

25:32.239 --> 25:34.741
-Herbert: Hey!
-(all laughing)

25:34.824 --> 25:36.576
Woo! How we all doin' tonight?

25:36.660 --> 25:38.870
(cheering)

25:38.954 --> 25:42.624
Yeah, you know,
this auction's taking longer
than I did to come out.

25:42.707 --> 25:43.959
It's wild.

25:44.042 --> 25:46.169
So, listen, I usually do
about a 40-minute set,

25:46.253 --> 25:48.421
but don't worry,
they've asked me
to keep it clean,

25:48.505 --> 25:50.423
so I should be done here
in about three minutes. Yeah.

25:50.507 --> 25:52.884
(all laughing)

25:55.428 --> 25:57.764
That's Che!
Che's performing?

25:57.847 --> 26:00.517
Oh, yeah.
You know what, Charlotte
roped me into participating,

26:00.600 --> 26:02.477
then I roped in Che, which,
actually, wasn't that big--

26:04.729 --> 26:08.692
Oh, okay, well.
The cheese stands alone.

26:10.318 --> 26:11.820
(indistinct chatter)

26:11.903 --> 26:13.113
(softly): Oh my god.

26:16.324 --> 26:18.576
Well, I am not
getting laid tonight.

26:18.660 --> 26:20.704
Zero hotties here,
except for the servers,

26:20.787 --> 26:22.831
and I have a strict
no cater-waiter policy.

26:22.914 --> 26:24.791
He's here.

26:24.874 --> 26:29.004
-Who?
-The teacher I went
on a date with last night.

26:29.087 --> 26:31.631
-Professor Puke? Where?
-Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm.

26:31.715 --> 26:35.635
He's, um, he's at the bar.
Wait, is that even him?

26:35.719 --> 26:38.179
It's hard to tell
because I'm seeing more
than the tops of his shoes.

26:38.263 --> 26:39.806
You know what?
Stand in front of me.

26:42.017 --> 26:43.351
It's all right.
Thanks. Have a good night.

26:43.435 --> 26:43.560
Carrie:
Is he leaving?

26:46.062 --> 26:48.231
Oh, yeah, it's okay.
He's leaving, okay.

26:48.315 --> 26:50.191
You know what?
Can you follow him out,

26:50.275 --> 26:53.611
and then come back
and tell me when you're sure

26:53.695 --> 26:56.364
he's out of
the building and gone?

26:56.448 --> 26:59.409
You want me to off him, too?
What am I, Mossad?

26:59.492 --> 27:02.704
-My husband died.
-You get one more of those.

27:02.787 --> 27:04.706
Okay. Go. Fast.

27:04.789 --> 27:08.752
We know we're not
your core demo,
but we love you.

27:08.835 --> 27:10.503
-Aww.
-Yeah. She turned me on to you.

27:10.587 --> 27:11.755
I watched your special,
like, I don't know,
like, 10 times.

27:11.838 --> 27:14.382
My husband's like,
"Veronica, what's
goin' on with you?"

27:14.466 --> 27:16.676
I did.
I read that piece on you
in "Vulture" and got addicted.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.011
-Ohh.
-Addicted.

27:18.094 --> 27:18.553
(fans chatting)

27:21.806 --> 27:25.310
(still chatting)

27:25.393 --> 27:27.645
-Fan: But we're fans
for life, like, for life.
-Che: Wow.

27:27.729 --> 27:32.734
Listen, I so appreciate this.
I see someone I know,

27:32.817 --> 27:34.819
-so I'm just, uh--
-Do your thing.

27:34.903 --> 27:37.030
-We'll be here a while.
-Che: Okay. Okay!

27:37.113 --> 27:39.366
Fan:
Fans for life!

27:39.449 --> 27:43.078
Hey, Rambo.
Were you just gonna leave
without saying hello?

27:43.161 --> 27:46.581
Oh, hi.
No. I, I mean, um...
you were, you were busy,

27:46.664 --> 27:49.542
and I, I was standing
there... for a while,

27:49.626 --> 27:51.586
and it, it looked
like that was...
gonna take a while,

27:51.669 --> 27:54.089
so, I just, you know,
I called an Uber.

27:54.172 --> 27:56.466
Mmm.
Okay, okay.

27:57.342 --> 27:59.219
So, how have you been?

27:59.302 --> 28:01.513
I've been fine, thank you.
And yourself?

28:02.764 --> 28:03.515
What's... going on?

28:03.598 --> 28:06.267
Why are you,
why're you being weird?

28:06.351 --> 28:08.853
Well, I don't
know how to be...

28:08.937 --> 28:09.854
You never wrote me back.

28:11.481 --> 28:12.524
You wrote me?

28:13.858 --> 28:14.609
DM'd me back or whatever.

28:16.986 --> 28:20.782
-Well, when did you DM me?
-Like three months ago.

28:20.865 --> 28:24.619
Three months? Miranda...
I-I've done a ton of weed.

28:24.702 --> 28:27.872
I, I can't--
I can barely remember
three hours ago.

28:27.956 --> 28:28.998
Plus, I get a lot of DMs.

28:30.375 --> 28:32.710
-I'm sure.
-Okay, no.

28:32.794 --> 28:35.672
I meant there's so much volume.

28:35.755 --> 28:38.049
I, I wasn't being a dick.
I just-- I, I seriously
just didn't clock it,

28:38.133 --> 28:40.301
and I'm sorry.

28:40.385 --> 28:43.471
You're busy. I'm busy.
It's all good.

28:44.556 --> 28:47.559
-(Che laughs)
-Did I just say,
"It's all good?"

28:47.642 --> 28:51.271
You should've just
DM'd me again.

28:51.354 --> 28:53.690
Ask for what you want.
That's a turn-on.

28:56.067 --> 28:57.235
I didn't know that.

28:58.486 --> 28:59.654
I'll tell you what I want...

29:01.990 --> 29:03.867
I wanna go someplace
with you...

29:06.286 --> 29:07.704
and take off
all your clothes.

29:09.414 --> 29:11.458
-Really?
-Really.

29:12.375 --> 29:13.668
(phone chimes)

29:18.006 --> 29:20.550
Well, my Uber is here.

29:20.633 --> 29:22.677
I have a 7:00 AM flight.
I have to go.

29:22.760 --> 29:24.512
No, you can't go.
The auction's not finished.

29:24.596 --> 29:26.055
You didn't tell me
the drama club was doing

29:26.139 --> 29:27.015
three songs from
"Dear Evan Hansen."

29:27.098 --> 29:30.727
-I love you so much.
-Yeah, 7:00 AM flight.

29:30.810 --> 29:32.687
-You can finish this without me.
-Are you crazy?!

29:32.770 --> 29:36.524
I am awful!
I can see it
in people's eyes.

29:36.608 --> 29:38.568
They're like,
"Oh god, not her again."

29:38.651 --> 29:40.487
What do you care if other
people think you're awful?

29:40.570 --> 29:42.238
How could you
say that to me?

29:42.322 --> 29:44.199
-Say what?
-That I'm awful.

29:44.282 --> 29:46.701
-I didn't say that.
-Y-- Okay...

29:46.784 --> 29:47.827
Mr. Improv
holdin' all the cards.

29:47.911 --> 29:52.081
I'm out there humiliated,
doing my best,

29:52.165 --> 29:54.000
and you're gonna stand here
and say that I'm awful?

29:54.083 --> 29:56.461
No, no, no.
I said that people--

29:56.544 --> 29:58.421
I didn't say that.
I said people, people
said that you were awful,

29:58.505 --> 30:00.215
-but I didn't--
-Hi.

30:00.298 --> 30:02.217
-(Herbert chuckles)
-We-we-we're just lookin'
for the restrooms.

30:02.300 --> 30:04.928
-Hey!
-Yeah. Yeah!

30:07.138 --> 30:07.722
Sorry.

30:07.805 --> 30:09.432
-No, no.
-I'm so sorry.

30:09.516 --> 30:12.435
Uh, watch
your step there.

30:13.311 --> 30:16.356
(audience applauding)

30:16.439 --> 30:20.318
-Oh, great. Now they
think we're that couple.
-Yeah, I'm sorry.

30:20.401 --> 30:21.986
Emcee:
Give it up for
the Arbor School

30:22.070 --> 30:23.530
drama department,
ladies and gentlemen.

30:23.613 --> 30:24.906
(deep sigh)

30:24.989 --> 30:27.951
I love you, baby.
How can I make it up to you?

30:28.034 --> 30:29.369
Emcee:
They were amazing!

30:29.452 --> 30:32.372
The Arbor School
drama department, everyone!

30:32.455 --> 30:35.792
And sold!
Item number 8248,

30:35.875 --> 30:39.045
a case of wine donated by
a seventh-grade parent from...

30:39.128 --> 30:42.257
wow, vineyard in Tuscany.
Enjoy your wine. All right.

30:42.340 --> 30:43.800
(applause)

30:43.883 --> 30:45.385
Herbert:
Enjoy your wine, all right!

30:45.468 --> 30:47.595
Carrie, you can't leave.

30:47.679 --> 30:48.846
Your item hasn't even
been auctioned off yet.

30:48.930 --> 30:51.683
I'm sorry,
but according
to Gay Mata Hari,

30:51.766 --> 30:53.017
this is my window.

30:53.101 --> 30:57.730
...a date with sex writer
Carrie Bradshaw, huh?

30:57.814 --> 31:00.275
-It was lunch, a lunch date.
-That's...

31:00.358 --> 31:02.443
That's what I told them.

31:02.527 --> 31:04.195
I was only on
the gathering committee,

31:04.279 --> 31:05.113
not on the program committee.

31:05.196 --> 31:07.615
A date with sex writer
Carrie Bradshaw.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.617
Starting bid, $500.

31:09.701 --> 31:12.704
And sex writer?
Like what-what-what?
Like I write porn?

31:12.787 --> 31:16.165
Um, you know what?
It-it's not a date.
It's a lunch date.

31:16.249 --> 31:20.503
And she's not a sex writer.
She writes about relationships,

31:20.587 --> 31:23.131
-and the nuances that go--
-Okay, please stop.
Please, please stop.

31:23.214 --> 31:27.302
Okay, thank you
for that clarification,
Charlotte, um...

31:27.385 --> 31:31.431
Carrie Bradshaw--
Is that who--?
That's Carrie Bradshaw.

31:31.514 --> 31:33.808
Ladies and gentlemen,
Carrie Bradshaw.

31:33.891 --> 31:35.602
Why don't you come on
up here and help me out?

31:35.685 --> 31:37.103
-Lord knows I need it, right?
-Oh, no, no, no.

31:37.186 --> 31:38.104
You're doing just fine,
just fine.

31:38.187 --> 31:41.107
Herbert: Oh, come on.
Come on, for the kids.

31:41.190 --> 31:44.319
-Hey, a round of applause
for Carrie Bradshaw, everybody.
-Our friendship is now over.

31:44.402 --> 31:46.404
Herbert:
Come on, it's for the kids.

31:47.447 --> 31:49.240
Hello.

31:49.324 --> 31:51.909
-I'm good, Herbert. How are you?
-All right, starting bid...

31:54.912 --> 31:57.749
Date with sex writer
Carrie Bradshaw, $500.

31:58.249 --> 32:00.585
Anyone?

32:00.668 --> 32:02.837
-Can't! We're all married.
-Herbert: Ah, that's true.

32:02.920 --> 32:07.216
But it is a lunch date,
not sex, right?

32:07.300 --> 32:10.678
Definitely not sex.
(awkward laughter)

32:10.762 --> 32:11.888
$500.

32:11.971 --> 32:13.681
-Oh, $450. $450, yeah.
-(glass breaks)

32:13.765 --> 32:16.267
-There we go, $450.
-No, no, no, no.

32:16.351 --> 32:19.354
We, we have a spill here.
We need a waiter.

32:19.437 --> 32:21.397
-Okay ...
-Do something!

32:21.481 --> 32:24.108
She's about to implode
like the house at the end
of "Poltergeist."

32:24.192 --> 32:26.611
(shouts):
$700! $700!

32:26.694 --> 32:28.029
(quietly): Oh dear.

32:28.112 --> 32:30.156
-Herbert: $700.
-$800!

32:30.239 --> 32:31.866
Well, now Charlotte's
biddin' against herself.

32:31.949 --> 32:34.452
Pump the brakes, babe.
Pump the brakes.

32:34.535 --> 32:36.412
You know what?
I bid a thousand.

32:36.496 --> 32:38.706
I bid a thousand,
and now, you can, uh...

32:38.790 --> 32:40.583
-Okay, a thousand dollars.
-Yep.

32:40.667 --> 32:44.003
Going once...
Going twice.

32:45.797 --> 32:47.382
Peter:
$1,050.

32:48.591 --> 32:51.552
Herbert:
$1,050.

32:51.636 --> 32:54.055
Once, twice, sold, $1,050.

32:54.138 --> 32:55.890
Uh-oh. He must've
snuck back in when I
was in the men's room

32:55.973 --> 32:58.726
getting a handjob
from that cater-waiter.

33:00.728 --> 33:03.398
(indistinct chatter)

33:05.316 --> 33:06.359
Carrie.

33:08.319 --> 33:10.655
-Hi.
-Hi.

33:10.738 --> 33:12.907
-Uh...
-Well, what are the odds?

33:12.990 --> 33:16.369
Wait, you're a,
you're a math teacher.
You probably know.

33:16.452 --> 33:20.748
Well, it definitely
involves an X to the...
power of hangover.

33:22.041 --> 33:23.793
-(sighs)
-Listen, uh, don't worry.

33:23.876 --> 33:26.003
We-we don't actually
have to go out again.

33:26.087 --> 33:29.382
Yeah. And I'm happy
to cover your bid.

33:29.465 --> 33:33.302
-Oh, no.
-You know, that was clearly
charity for all parties.

33:33.386 --> 33:34.429
No, no, no, no.
I wouldn't think of it.

33:34.512 --> 33:38.182
I'm impressed
you even remember
the subject I teach.

33:38.266 --> 33:39.767
Oh, uh, that's
the extent, really.

33:39.851 --> 33:42.395
Well, we should
go out again.

33:42.478 --> 33:44.105
We have so much
to discuss.

33:44.188 --> 33:45.815
Like, how did
I get home?
(laughs)

33:45.898 --> 33:47.859
Did, did we even pay
for those drinks?

33:47.942 --> 33:52.321
-Oh, we paid.
-Yes, yes we did.

33:53.531 --> 33:56.367
Oh... yeah, okay.
Let's do it.

33:57.577 --> 34:00.830
-It's for the kids.
-For the kids, yes.

34:00.913 --> 34:01.873
(chuckles)

34:01.956 --> 34:03.624
-Okay.
-Okay (chuckles).

34:03.708 --> 34:05.376
-Good night.
-Good night, okay.

34:07.712 --> 34:10.297
I've never felt anything
so intense in my life.

34:10.380 --> 34:12.175
(panting)

34:14.342 --> 34:15.011
I think I'm
in love with you.

34:21.434 --> 34:24.853
You're in love with you...
with me.

34:26.731 --> 34:29.525
And the weed
doesn't hurt.

34:29.609 --> 34:33.696
No, no.
It's not just that.

34:38.326 --> 34:40.369
True, I'm also
very good at sex.

34:41.120 --> 34:45.373
-You... are.
