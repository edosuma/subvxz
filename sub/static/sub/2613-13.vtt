WEBVTT

00:06.806 --> 00:13.246
Hear that
lonesome whippoorwill

00:13.247 --> 00:19.184
He sounds too blue to fly

00:19.185 --> 00:25.058
The midnight train
is winding low

00:25.059 --> 00:31.361
l’m so lonesome I could cry.

01:01.995 --> 01:04.190
Hey, you need a lift?

01:16.009 --> 01:19.001
So, where you headed?

01:20.647 --> 01:23.445
It's not where I’m headed.

01:41.468 --> 01:43.103
Welcome to Good Springs.

01:43.104 --> 01:43.869
Long drive.

01:43.870 --> 01:45.905
I know it's out
of your jurisdiction,

01:45.906 --> 01:47.474
but your name
is on the tape.

01:47.475 --> 01:48.541
Where is he?

01:48.542 --> 01:49.241
lnside.

01:49.242 --> 01:51.211
We left the recorder
where we found it.

01:51.212 --> 01:53.263
Anything else?

01:53.264 --> 01:55.315
Victim's wallet.

01:55.316 --> 01:56.613
Thank you.

01:56.614 --> 01:57.911
You bet.

02:04.157 --> 02:07.392
Pete Walker,
California.

02:07.393 --> 02:11.331
Date of birth:
August 17, 1957.

02:11.332 --> 02:13.700
That's got
to be the work

02:13.701 --> 02:15.467
of Paul Millander.

02:15.468 --> 02:18.801
What do you think
brought him back out?

02:19.205 --> 02:20.968
The rain?

02:22.876 --> 02:25.811
Hasn't changed
his M.O.--

02:25.912 --> 02:28.147
kills men
whose birthdays

02:28.148 --> 02:30.116
are on the anniversary
of his father's murder.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.117
In descending order --

02:31.151 --> 02:34.120
first victim
was August 17, 1959;

02:34.154 --> 02:37.023
second victim,
August 17, 1958;

02:37.024 --> 02:39.048
this guy, 1957.

02:45.098 --> 02:47.123
Ready for this?

02:47.167 --> 02:49.836
I have a pretty good idea
what it's going to say.

02:49.837 --> 02:52.171
WALKER (anxiously):
My name is Pete Walker.

02:52.172 --> 02:57.310
I reside at 715 Lady Del Sol,
and l’m 44 years of age.

02:57.311 --> 02:59.211
I’m going to kill myself.

02:59.212 --> 03:04.082
l’d like to say "I love you"
to my mother.

03:04.083 --> 03:08.054
l’m so sorry. I never wanted
to put you through this.

03:08.055 --> 03:11.046
I just can't do it anymore.

03:13.193 --> 03:17.095
MlLLANDER'S VOlCE:
Happy birthday, Mr. Grissom.

03:18.198 --> 03:21.100
Isn't your birthday
in August?

03:21.101 --> 03:23.193
August 17, 1956.

04:11.017 --> 04:12.184
Hey.

04:12.185 --> 04:14.210
Is it true?
Millander?

04:14.254 --> 04:16.039
SlDLE:
Yeah, it's true.

04:16.040 --> 04:17.822
Gunshot, suicide script,

04:17.824 --> 04:19.926
leaves the body
in a bathtub.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.223
Paul Millander.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.889
Remember
the first victim? Royce Harmon?

04:24.931 --> 04:26.699
Stuart Rampler, second...

04:26.700 --> 04:28.965
And now...

04:28.966 --> 04:31.231
Pete Walker.

04:31.271 --> 04:34.274
Grissom, Catherine briefed us
about your birth date.

04:34.275 --> 04:35.442
Yeah, what's up with that?

04:35.443 --> 04:36.608
Coincidence.
Make anything

04:36.609 --> 04:39.412
more of it, gives Millander
more power than he deserves.

04:39.413 --> 04:42.282
We work together; he can't
outsmart all five of us.

04:42.283 --> 04:44.147
Yes, he can.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.489
Plan of attack -- split up.

04:50.490 --> 04:53.293
Nick, take the tape over to AV -- break it

04:53.294 --> 04:54.993
Warrick, Sara--

04:54.994 --> 04:56.586
examine the perimeter.

04:56.629 --> 04:58.256
We need to know
how he got in and got out.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.289
We'll stay with the body.

05:02.935 --> 05:05.016
Thanks.

05:05.017 --> 05:07.097
Big night.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.075
SlDLE: Rain washed away everything.

05:10.076 --> 05:12.211
What I got will never
hold up in court.

05:12.212 --> 05:15.348
Well, I got
some mud prints.

05:15.349 --> 05:16.615
Check these out.

05:16.616 --> 05:18.982
SlDLE:
This is the point of origin.

05:19.018 --> 05:21.282
They stop at
the warehouse threshold.

05:21.321 --> 05:24.290
BROWN: He must've taken off
his boots before he stepped in.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.986
Only one set
of prints...

05:27.994 --> 05:32.465
Check out the depth of the impression

05:32.466 --> 05:34.499
He carried the body in.

05:34.500 --> 05:38.402
The extra weight explains
the deeper impression.

05:40.406 --> 05:43.273
Shoot it.

05:47.780 --> 05:49.410
Cath, come here.

05:49.411 --> 05:51.040
Take a look at this.

06:01.627 --> 06:03.028
It’s not lividity.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.797
He's got stippling
on the side of his face.

06:05.798 --> 06:09.325
>From what I can tell, he was shot once
in the chest.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.337
Unburned gunpowder
wouldn't plume this way.

06:11.371 --> 06:14.033
No entry wounds
near his face.

06:16.542 --> 06:19.892
I’ll have Robbins
check for leaks.

06:19.893 --> 06:23.243
Maybe he can find
a hidden bullet.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.361
Wait.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.224
Wait a minute.

06:37.225 --> 06:39.054
I got something.

06:46.839 --> 06:48.673
Hello, Dolly.

06:48.674 --> 06:51.944
Dark hair,
12 inches.

06:51.945 --> 06:53.678
Female?

06:53.679 --> 06:54.914
So, another
victim...

06:54.915 --> 06:57.576
or an accomplice?

06:58.217 --> 07:01.087
(recorded voice):
My name is Pete Walker.

07:01.088 --> 07:03.222
I reside at 715 Lady Del Sol...

07:03.223 --> 07:03.989
First things first.

07:03.990 --> 07:06.325
This tape was not
recorded in the warehouse.

07:06.326 --> 07:08.094
There's no auditory echo.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.391
Contained quarters.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.397
Yeah.
A car, small SUV.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.399
The tape was an inch
from his mouth.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.401
Sibilant pops
bear that out.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.770
Helps that the killer uses
hi-fi mini cassettes.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.397
Picks up
everything ambient.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.430
Let me get rid of the wipers.

07:24.444 --> 07:27.947
What is that--
that "whir" sound?

07:27.948 --> 07:30.549
I don't know yet.

07:30.550 --> 07:32.108
But... recognize this?

07:34.454 --> 07:38.591
Oh, yeah. Willie Hank's
"Don't Pay the Ransom."

07:38.592 --> 07:40.877
I’ll contact the local country and western

07:40.878 --> 07:43.162
get a time and tape
on when the song aired--

07:43.163 --> 07:44.464
establish a timeline.

07:44.465 --> 07:45.431
What else?

07:45.465 --> 07:48.434
Now, here's
where it gets funky.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.436
Watch my sensor levels.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.471
WALKER: My name is Pete
Walker. I reside at...

07:52.472 --> 07:55.174
See how the color wands gravitate
towards the bottom right corner?

07:55.175 --> 07:57.176
Mm-hmm.
There's an auditory imbalance.

07:57.177 --> 07:58.778
>From what? A blown speaker?

07:58.779 --> 08:00.745
A blown left speaker.

08:00.746 --> 08:03.115
Sounds like the driver's
side one blew.

08:03.116 --> 08:05.485
Pulling all of the sound
bottom right.

08:05.486 --> 08:07.486
Now, if that were true,

08:07.487 --> 08:10.490
the victim may have been sitting in the

08:10.491 --> 08:12.458
What does that get you?

08:12.492 --> 08:15.461
Millander was driving.

08:15.495 --> 08:18.764
I believe hitchhiking
is illegal in Clark County.

08:18.765 --> 08:20.633
Yeah, you got me.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.501
Came with the car

08:22.502 --> 08:25.238
along with the registration.

08:25.239 --> 08:27.106
The R.O.'s our vic--

08:27.107 --> 08:28.358
Pete Walker.

08:28.359 --> 08:29.608
Who flagged it?

08:29.609 --> 08:31.276
Nevada State Patrol.

08:31.277 --> 08:33.145
So, this
is Walker's car.

08:33.145 --> 08:35.448
Millander
was hitchhiking.

08:35.448 --> 08:37.750
Guy stops
to do a favour...

08:37.751 --> 08:38.517
ends up dead.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.020
Yeah, but how
would Millander know

08:41.020 --> 08:43.836
that the guy
who'd pick him up

08:43.837 --> 08:46.651
had a birthday
August 17, 1957?

08:50.963 --> 08:53.399
There's the
initial bullet hole.

08:53.400 --> 08:54.533
No other leaks.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.970
Died from a single gunshot wound
to the chest,

08:57.971 --> 09:00.739
just like the others.

09:00.740 --> 09:03.476
The others didn't
have stippling

09:03.477 --> 09:04.476
on the side of their faces.

09:04.477 --> 09:08.709
Unburned gunpowder doesn't
change direction and stick.

09:10.650 --> 09:13.141
Unless...

09:14.887 --> 09:19.758
he turned his face away
from the gun.

09:19.759 --> 09:23.251
Not likely, due to the origin
of the facial burn.

09:24.897 --> 09:27.934
Nobody misses
from this distance.

09:27.935 --> 09:29.868
True.

09:29.869 --> 09:31.704
I think this might be

09:31.705 --> 09:33.389
intentional

09:33.390 --> 09:35.073
I-I-I call it

09:35.074 --> 09:37.565
"Good Versus Evil."

09:41.447 --> 09:45.247
He's telling me he's going
to show me both sides.

09:55.795 --> 09:58.320
BROWN:
I found some G.S.R.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.397
SlDLE:
Nice.

10:08.608 --> 10:11.277
That's why Grissom
didn't find a bullet.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.574
It went out the window.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.580
It went
out the window.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.482
l’m so sorry.
I never wanted

10:16.483 --> 10:18.347
to put you through this.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.620
I just can't do it anymore.

10:20.621 --> 10:22.611
I've lost hope.

10:25.291 --> 10:28.628
I’m going to call Nick,
tell him we found out

10:28.629 --> 10:31.831
what that unidentified
whir sound was--

10:31.832 --> 10:34.595
the window going down.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.603
SANDERS: Your planted hair
is full of information.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.605
It’s got a complete follicular tag.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.641
Well, the vic had
light brown hair,

10:41.642 --> 10:43.193
so we know it's not his.

10:43.194 --> 10:45.370
Could be
Millender’s.

10:45.371 --> 10:47.545
Well, that's
impossible.

10:47.546 --> 10:49.582
The amelogenin
on the follicle

10:49.583 --> 10:52.201
came back XX-- female.

10:52.202 --> 10:54.819
So, back to that again.

10:54.820 --> 10:57.156
Another victim,
or an accomplice?

10:57.157 --> 10:59.624
Yeah, but what decade?

10:59.659 --> 11:01.727
What do you mean?

11:01.728 --> 11:03.795
Look under400-X.

11:03.796 --> 11:05.764
The tag cell
is aged.

11:10.036 --> 11:12.630
So Millander planted
an aged hair?

11:12.672 --> 11:15.006
But, once exposed,
the tag

11:15.007 --> 11:17.877
would dry up and fall off,
especially in transport.

11:17.878 --> 11:19.479
Not if he nurtured it--

11:19.480 --> 11:21.080
kept it in a freezer.

11:21.081 --> 11:23.281
That would work.

11:23.282 --> 11:25.418
WlLLOWS:
Okay, so what's he

11:25.419 --> 11:26.618
trying to tell us?

11:26.619 --> 11:29.055
That he used to kill women?

11:29.056 --> 11:31.524
Maybe just one.

11:31.525 --> 11:33.719
Grounds?

11:34.627 --> 11:37.187
I don't know yet.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.700
Is this the car
the guy was killed in?

12:14.734 --> 12:16.634
He was killed
in the warehouse --

12:16.635 --> 12:18.470
and don't sneak up
on a person like that.

12:18.471 --> 12:21.702
Now you know how I feel,
like, ten times a day.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.243
So what's this
Millander guy's thing?

12:24.244 --> 12:26.746
He saw his dad killed
when he was a kid

12:26.747 --> 12:28.480
over some money dispute.

12:28.481 --> 12:31.450
Ends up killing
guys himself.

12:32.818 --> 12:34.419
Check that out.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.888
An eight digit number
with a dash.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.426
Pep Boys receipt?
Dry cleaning tags?

12:41.427 --> 12:43.725
Well, whatever it is, it happened during the

12:43.763 --> 12:45.765
Paper only burns itself
into plastic

12:45.766 --> 12:47.733
in high levels of heat.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.603
So what kind of paper item would you

12:50.604 --> 12:51.803
in the heat of summer?

12:51.804 --> 12:55.372
Something
you didn't want.

12:55.373 --> 12:58.941
Or something
you had to keep.

13:04.817 --> 13:06.302
Powwow.

13:06.303 --> 13:07.786
Later.

13:07.787 --> 13:12.358
Nevada State Patrol found
the victim's vehicle here.

13:12.359 --> 13:15.628
Found the body
in Good Springs here.

13:15.629 --> 13:17.213
Warrick and I
found stippling

13:17.214 --> 13:18.797
on the passenger-
side seat back.

13:18.798 --> 13:22.084
WARRlCK: We were thinking
Millander posed as a hitchhiker,

13:22.085 --> 13:25.446
overpowered Walker, and then
faked a gunshot in the car.

13:25.447 --> 13:28.808
I put a call into three area
country and western stations.

13:28.809 --> 13:30.776
Got the FCC list
for each.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.791
During the time of the victim's
suicide recording,

13:33.792 --> 13:36.772
KWV had Willie Hank's
"Don't Pay the Ransom"

13:36.816 --> 13:39.485
playing from 1:47 a.m.
to 1:51 a.m.

13:39.486 --> 13:42.154
And what time was
sunrise this morning?

13:42.155 --> 13:42.987
5:13 a.m.

13:42.988 --> 13:44.924
So that's about
a three hour window.

13:44.925 --> 13:45.824
He was racing
daylight.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.394
WlLLOWS: So, in that time,
he had to get the recording,

13:48.395 --> 13:49.793
and get rid of the body.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.490
Made the recording in the car,

13:51.530 --> 13:52.792
killed him in the warehouse.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.568
No, he carried him
into the warehouse.

13:55.569 --> 13:57.202
Yeah?

13:57.203 --> 13:59.797
Mud prints--
one set in, one set out.

13:59.839 --> 14:03.475
Are we sure he didn't kill him
in the car?

14:03.476 --> 14:06.061
He was shot in the warehouse.

14:06.062 --> 14:08.647
He was incapacitated in the car.

14:08.648 --> 14:10.816
SlDLE:
Okay, how?

14:10.817 --> 14:12.984
Grissom, you want

14:12.985 --> 14:15.510
to add something
to this?

14:17.523 --> 14:20.292
Yeah. None of it matters.

14:20.293 --> 14:23.061
It’s one
of those few cases

14:23.062 --> 14:25.998
where physical evidence
isn't helping us much.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.599
I mean, put it in context.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.603
The victim's birthday is always
on the anniversary

14:30.604 --> 14:32.204
of the murder
of Millender’s father--

14:32.205 --> 14:34.536
staged like his father's death.

14:34.573 --> 14:35.874
A planted hair,

14:35.875 --> 14:38.259
a planted
fingerprint...

14:38.260 --> 14:40.644
it's all biographical.

14:40.880 --> 14:44.216
He's using the evidence
to tell us a story.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.149
Hey...

14:45.150 --> 14:46.951
Peter Walker,
our victim,

14:46.952 --> 14:50.623
worked for Cinema Road Services
in Valencia, California.

14:50.624 --> 14:53.092
Drives the newly released
film reels

14:53.093 --> 14:54.259
back and forth to Vegas.

14:54.260 --> 14:56.795
Drops off the new reels
every Tuesday

14:56.796 --> 14:58.214
for Friday's release.

14:58.215 --> 14:59.631
Brings the old one back.

14:59.632 --> 15:01.566
Drives the same route
all the time?

15:01.600 --> 15:03.869
Yeah, according
to his mileage log.

15:03.870 --> 15:06.138
Did Walker have
any kind of record?

15:06.139 --> 15:07.867
BRASS:
Pretty much a Boy Scout

15:07.907 --> 15:10.292
except for a speeding ticket.

15:10.293 --> 15:12.678
Speeding ticket?
How long ago?

15:12.679 --> 15:15.909
July 2, last year.

15:17.516 --> 15:19.017
Summer.

15:19.018 --> 15:23.216
909987-23...

15:25.791 --> 15:27.125
Pete Walker.

15:27.126 --> 15:28.794
Excessive speed.

15:28.795 --> 15:30.461
July 2, 2001.

15:30.462 --> 15:32.698
Walker's birth date's
on the ticket.

15:32.699 --> 15:33.892
August 17, 1957.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.601
Run the other two vics.

15:35.602 --> 15:36.932
Royce Harmon.

15:37.436 --> 15:41.373
WlLLOWS: Employment--
Dinners Delivered.

15:41.374 --> 15:42.897
Need a car for that.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.604
What about
his driving record, Jim?

15:48.547 --> 15:51.450
He drove himself right out of a license.

15:51.451 --> 15:54.152
Try Stuart Rampler.

15:54.153 --> 15:56.955
STOKES:
There's a few tickets.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.591
Last violation--
excessive speed, June, 2000.

15:59.592 --> 16:01.923
So what's the commonality?

16:01.961 --> 16:03.929
Besides birth dates.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.954
Besides birth dates...

16:07.066 --> 16:11.560
BRASS:
All the tickets were written by the same cop.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.967
Excuse me.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.647
Officer Yarnell?

16:21.648 --> 16:22.613
Yeah.

16:22.614 --> 16:26.284
My name's Gil Grissom,
with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.

16:26.285 --> 16:29.954
May I ask you how many
speeding tickets you issue a day?

16:29.989 --> 16:31.957
Why is it any
business of yours?

16:31.991 --> 16:34.960
You wrote tickets to three
people who ended up dead.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.929
You think I had
something to do with it?

16:38.731 --> 16:39.915
Look, I’m a good cop.

16:39.916 --> 16:41.099
I protect and serve.

16:41.100 --> 16:42.965
I even go to court
on my days off.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.671
You mean court dates
for speeding tickets?

16:45.672 --> 16:47.039
Yeah. Sometimes,
believe it or not,

16:47.040 --> 16:48.666
people actually
contest them,

16:48.741 --> 16:50.242
and I’m there fighting
it tooth and nail.

16:50.243 --> 16:51.127
Court.

16:51.128 --> 16:52.010
Yeah.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.580
In fact, I just responded
to a challenge this morning.

16:54.581 --> 16:55.979
Always the same judge?

16:56.015 --> 16:58.984
No, there's three
traffic court judges.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.816
Session's
about to start.Why don't you go bother

17:04.022 --> 17:05.991
All rise.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.993
Honourable Judge Douglas Mason
presiding...

17:09.028 --> 17:12.431
Municipal Court,
city of Mulberry,

17:12.432 --> 17:14.797
state of Nevada.

17:31.784 --> 17:34.048
You may be seated.

17:48.267 --> 17:49.734
Gil.

17:52.838 --> 17:55.033
Excuse me, Officer.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.808
I’m with the Las Vegas
Crime Lab.

17:56.809 --> 17:58.343
I need you to arrest
a murder suspect.

17:58.344 --> 18:00.312
Where's the suspect?

18:00.313 --> 18:01.279
Judge Mason.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.215
His real name
is Paul Millander.

18:03.216 --> 18:05.740
You don't want
to do this.

18:05.818 --> 18:08.048
Sir, please take a seat.

18:09.088 --> 18:12.057
Officer, this man is not who he's
pretending to be.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.058
Take a seat now
or I’ll have you

18:13.092 --> 18:15.127
removed from this courtroom
and charged with contempt.

18:15.128 --> 18:17.630
He's wanted in Clark County for murder.

18:17.631 --> 18:20.132
You are now in contempt
of court. Bailiff?

18:20.133 --> 18:21.732
Come on.

18:21.733 --> 18:23.769
I apologize
for the disruption.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.770
Let's proceed.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.068
You may be seated, miss.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.074
You can leave
this court

18:29.108 --> 18:31.838
when it has concluded
its business.

18:34.646 --> 18:38.878
Or find yourself in contempt
along with your friend.

18:48.794 --> 18:51.796
Where are you from?

18:51.797 --> 18:54.266
You know where
I’m from...

18:54.267 --> 18:56.734
and I know who you are.

18:56.735 --> 18:59.101
l’m not who
you think I am.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.872
Local police have
been out here twice

19:00.873 --> 19:04.104
this past year about this
man-- Paul Millander, is it?--

19:04.143 --> 19:06.812
every time his story's
in the paper.

19:06.813 --> 19:09.114
I've heard
I look like him.

19:09.115 --> 19:10.342
ldentical.

19:11.150 --> 19:14.119
You've heard
of the Doppelganger Syndrome?

19:14.153 --> 19:18.157
That every person is supposed
to have an exact double

19:18.158 --> 19:19.659
somewhere in the world?

19:19.660 --> 19:21.244
Do you believe in it?

19:21.245 --> 19:22.685
Never been proved.

19:22.686 --> 19:24.125
A Swiss neurobiologist

19:24.163 --> 19:28.122
recently published papers
supporting its viability.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.285
Brugger, I think his name is.

19:30.286 --> 19:32.404
Stands to reason
this Millander

19:32.405 --> 19:34.133
is my doppelganger.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.073
The monkey wrench for you

19:36.074 --> 19:38.167
is that we're both here
in the state of Nevada.

19:40.112 --> 19:44.105
Well, you know, we could
always do a DNA test.

19:44.183 --> 19:47.152
You know, if you
keep that up,

19:47.186 --> 19:50.856
people are going to
start calling you crazy.

19:50.857 --> 19:53.120
Guard.

19:57.196 --> 20:01.132
I trust you won't go near my courtroom

20:05.204 --> 20:07.172
Before you go back
to Las Vegas,

20:07.206 --> 20:09.197
why don't you
come to dinner?

20:09.541 --> 20:12.076
I tell my wife
stories about my day,

20:12.077 --> 20:14.910
and this one she may
need to hear in person.

20:15.981 --> 20:18.149
6:00.

20:18.150 --> 20:21.085
That's my address.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.950
We live right here
in Mulberry.

20:35.934 --> 20:38.853
Any chance
he's got a twin?

20:38.854 --> 20:41.030
A doppelganger,
evidently.

20:41.031 --> 20:43.206
Do you have your
mentholatum?

20:43.242 --> 20:44.676
Why, you getting a cold?

20:44.677 --> 20:45.574
No.

20:45.611 --> 20:47.246
The judge just got sloppy.

20:47.247 --> 20:49.214
Thanks.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.502
Ah, fuming.

20:53.503 --> 20:55.920
I’ll lift it

20:55.921 --> 20:57.218
and get it to the lab.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.691
Go ahead and take
the Tahoe. Call me later.

20:59.692 --> 21:01.921
I’m going to dinner.

21:03.929 --> 21:06.265
Greg, did you look
at the female hair

21:06.266 --> 21:08.233
from the crime
scene tub?

21:08.267 --> 21:12.226
When you say "Jump,"
I say "How high?"

21:12.271 --> 21:15.707
I found testosterone
in female hair.

21:15.741 --> 21:17.275
Post pubescent
female hair.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.938
Well, men and women
both have testosterone

21:19.978 --> 21:21.240
No big deal, right?

21:21.280 --> 21:22.247
Well, this is.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.950
This testosterone's
endogenous.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.600
What? What do you mean?

21:26.601 --> 21:28.249
Like outside the body?

21:28.287 --> 21:30.949
lnjections. Supplements.

21:31.323 --> 21:34.293
So our mystery lady was trying
to enhance

21:34.294 --> 21:36.762
her athletic performance?

21:36.763 --> 21:39.515
Or increase her sex drive.

21:39.516 --> 21:42.267
You know women do that.

21:42.268 --> 21:43.467
I read.

21:43.468 --> 21:45.304
None that I've ever met.

21:45.305 --> 21:47.272
Not yet anyway.

21:47.306 --> 21:48.506
Okay, I’m not sure

21:48.507 --> 21:51.943
what this means yet, but thanks.

22:31.316 --> 22:33.011
Mr. Grissom?

22:33.352 --> 22:37.089
I was admiring
these rain boots.

22:37.090 --> 22:39.023
Please come in.

22:51.103 --> 22:53.472
You have a lovely home.

22:53.473 --> 22:55.337
We like it.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.342
May I ask how long
you've lived here?

22:57.376 --> 23:00.445
We bought the year
we adopted Craig,

23:00.446 --> 23:03.039
so that would be '92.

23:03.615 --> 23:06.952
Craig, what did I tell you
you had to do

23:06.953 --> 23:09.120
when our dinner guest arrived?

23:09.121 --> 23:11.890
Hi, I’m Craig Mason.
Nice to meet you.

23:11.891 --> 23:14.358
Nice to meet you, Craig.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.728
Want an I.D. tag
for safety?

23:16.729 --> 23:19.063
Craig's school is sponsoring

23:19.064 --> 23:21.362
an identification program for students.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.391
Parents get one, too.

23:23.735 --> 23:26.397
Can't be too safe out there,
can we, Mr. Grissom?

23:26.705 --> 23:30.368
No, we can't.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.309
Hungry?

23:34.546 --> 23:36.180
That reminds me, Doug.

23:36.181 --> 23:37.748
Be sure to tell Mr. Grissom

23:37.749 --> 23:39.084
where you bought
your rain boots.

23:39.085 --> 23:40.552
He was admiring them earlier.

23:40.553 --> 23:42.086
Was he?

23:42.087 --> 23:43.738
My husband's
only hobby

23:43.739 --> 23:45.389
is driving around the state

23:45.390 --> 23:47.575
looking for bargains,
rain or shine.

23:47.576 --> 23:49.761
And I tell him,
"You're a judge now.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.162
We don't need bargains."

23:51.163 --> 23:55.299
To which I reply,
"Old habits die hard."

23:55.300 --> 23:58.098
Truth is, I think
he just enjoys his private time.

23:59.104 --> 24:00.435
Dear.

24:01.940 --> 24:03.407
As a judge, I don't want

24:03.442 --> 24:06.411
the outside world privy
to my private life

24:06.445 --> 24:09.107
because they'll use
it against me.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.114
You'll be safe now.

24:31.903 --> 24:34.269
Excuse me. I’m sorry.

24:37.042 --> 24:38.209
Grissom.

24:38.210 --> 24:40.144
You're never going to believe

24:40.145 --> 24:42.681
who Judge Mason's
fingerprints match.

24:42.682 --> 24:44.410
Judge Mason.

24:44.483 --> 24:47.018
As printed when he was sworn
before the bar,3

24:47.019 --> 24:49.254
Nevada State Municipal Court.

24:49.255 --> 24:51.589
Okay.

24:51.590 --> 24:53.148
Thank you.

24:55.594 --> 24:58.062
My prints came back sound.

24:59.164 --> 25:00.461
Douglas?

25:00.499 --> 25:02.233
As I told you
earlier, dear,

25:02.234 --> 25:05.465
Mr. Grissom has confused me with a very

25:05.504 --> 25:08.473
I left him fingerprints
so that he could confirm

25:08.507 --> 25:10.498
that I am
who I say I am.

25:14.246 --> 25:17.616
Uh... I have to get back
to my lab right away.

25:17.617 --> 25:18.215
I’m sorry.

25:18.216 --> 25:20.485
Thank you for
a lovely dinner, Mrs. Mason.

25:20.486 --> 25:23.320
Craig.

25:23.321 --> 25:25.346
Your Honour.

25:28.493 --> 25:30.729
I don't care
what the computer says,

25:30.730 --> 25:32.263
that guy is Paul Millander.

25:32.264 --> 25:34.198
Yeah, we know that.
How do we prove it?

25:34.232 --> 25:36.496
We have to disprove this Judge Mason.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.526
Birth certificate --
was he born in Mulberry?

25:38.570 --> 25:41.198
Well, that's the first
thing that Brass looked into.

25:41.239 --> 25:44.504
Apparently, the records
building burned down in 1982.

25:44.543 --> 25:45.510
Burned down?

25:45.544 --> 25:48.513
Ruled arson.
No suspects ever found.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.348
So Judge Mason has
no birth certificate.

25:50.349 --> 25:51.508
How convenient.

25:52.117 --> 25:54.352
Man, this guy plays way out in front.

25:54.353 --> 25:55.152
Here's some good news.

25:55.153 --> 25:56.835
Brass went to
the new records building

25:56.836 --> 25:58.517
looking for anything
on a Millander.

25:58.557 --> 26:02.516
Found current
property-tax accounts.

26:04.262 --> 26:08.533
In the name of Paul
and lsabelle Millander.

26:08.534 --> 26:10.000
Mm-hmm.

26:28.453 --> 26:30.284
lsabelle Millander?

26:31.957 --> 26:34.292
We're with the
Las Vegas crime lab.

26:34.293 --> 26:36.760
Are you here
about my husband?

26:36.761 --> 26:39.228
That happened
over 30 years ago.

26:42.367 --> 26:44.468
It’s our understanding

26:44.469 --> 26:49.270
that your child witnessed
your husband's murder.

26:52.043 --> 26:53.567
Thank you.

26:55.080 --> 26:57.581
My child was only ten years old.

26:57.582 --> 27:00.574
So brave to testify
against those men.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.587
But it didn't matter.

27:02.621 --> 27:06.358
The judge ruled it a suicide,
and those men went free.

27:06.359 --> 27:08.588
I hope we're not interrupting.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.629
It looks as if you're expecting
someone for dinner.

27:10.630 --> 27:13.365
I always set an extra place for Paul.

27:13.366 --> 27:14.593
Your son?

27:14.633 --> 27:16.418
My husband.

27:16.419 --> 27:18.202
My way of

27:18.203 --> 27:20.364
being together.

27:23.208 --> 27:25.608
Those are from
his best years.

27:25.644 --> 27:28.513
He started a company
out in Hollywood

27:28.514 --> 27:29.980
in the 1930s.

27:30.782 --> 27:32.583
GRlSSOM:
Hallo weird.

27:32.584 --> 27:34.753
Movie makeup. He used himself

27:34.754 --> 27:36.787
as a model.

27:36.788 --> 27:40.258
He made hand moulds and masks--

27:40.259 --> 27:42.443
Like a one-man
company.

27:42.444 --> 27:44.628
May I use your bathroom?

27:44.663 --> 27:46.631
Last door down the hall.

27:46.665 --> 27:48.600
Would you
happen to have

27:48.601 --> 27:50.534
any of his work still?

27:50.535 --> 27:54.339
I kept only what's
most sentimental.

27:54.340 --> 27:57.536
Might I take
a look at it?

28:57.335 --> 28:59.721
Almost childlike.

28:59.722 --> 29:02.199
Our child made it.

29:02.200 --> 29:04.675
It’s an ashtray?

29:04.676 --> 29:09.443
My husband used his own hand
to imprint the centre.

29:10.849 --> 29:12.407
May I?

29:20.425 --> 29:23.995
I wonder what this green discoloration is.

29:23.996 --> 29:27.726
I was often curious about that.

29:27.766 --> 29:30.735
I could take this back to the lab and analyze

29:30.769 --> 29:32.771
I promise
to bring it back.

29:32.772 --> 29:35.604
Okay.

30:16.815 --> 30:19.984
What are you doing
in my daughter's room?

30:19.985 --> 30:22.316
Oh...

30:22.821 --> 30:25.824
I have
a daughter myself.

30:25.825 --> 30:27.326
I was admiring

30:27.327 --> 30:29.061
the old clothes.

30:29.062 --> 30:30.795
She's beautiful.

30:33.765 --> 30:36.345
She died.

30:36.346 --> 30:38.925
I’m sorry.

30:39.537 --> 30:41.801
When did she die?

30:41.840 --> 30:45.193
A long time ago.

30:45.194 --> 30:48.546
A lifetime ago.

30:50.849 --> 30:53.517
What about your son Paul?

30:53.518 --> 30:55.987
I think it's time
for you to go now.

30:55.988 --> 30:57.521
Mrs. Millander

30:57.522 --> 30:58.890
we're just trying to clarify...

30:58.891 --> 31:00.915
Please?

31:07.899 --> 31:11.002
So, Paul Millander
killed his sister.

31:11.003 --> 31:13.637
It’s plausible.

31:13.638 --> 31:15.807
It’s not provable...

31:15.808 --> 31:18.071
yet.

31:29.554 --> 31:30.851
SANDERS:
No, you were right.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.890
The substance is Microcil -like,

31:32.891 --> 31:35.860
but it's really
old-school -- alginate.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.862
The book says
that, uh...

31:37.896 --> 31:40.632
makeup people
used it up to the '70s

31:40.633 --> 31:42.367
to make moulds
and impressions.

31:42.368 --> 31:44.102
lt’s green, hence the "algin"

31:44.103 --> 31:45.369
in "alginate."

31:45.370 --> 31:48.567
We sold 10,000 of those units
last Halloween. Even used

31:48.606 --> 31:50.574
my own hand
for the mould.

31:50.608 --> 31:52.843
These were his father's prints.

31:52.844 --> 31:56.041
He was planting them
as if they were his own.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.788
SANDERS:
The guy's pretty shrewd.

32:04.789 --> 32:06.882
Every murder
comes back to a dead man.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.861
Greg, if I refer to Millander as smart, it's one

32:09.862 --> 32:11.886
but I mind if
other people do it, okay?

32:11.930 --> 32:13.761
Got it.

32:13.932 --> 32:16.601
What have you got on the hair
Catherine recovered?

32:16.602 --> 32:18.870
Processing it next, sir.

32:18.871 --> 32:20.269
Find me.

32:25.209 --> 32:27.477
Did I miss something?

32:27.478 --> 32:30.081
It’s a kid's fingerprint from the baseball

32:30.082 --> 32:32.317
GRlSSOM:
Clear.

32:32.318 --> 32:33.632
Concise.

32:33.633 --> 32:34.946
Anonymous.

32:35.186 --> 32:38.053
Brass found no prints
from little Pauline--

32:38.054 --> 32:40.921
no birth records,
no death certificate.

32:40.959 --> 32:44.629
I’m going to use the prints from the only
other kid who

32:44.630 --> 32:46.620
Here come de judge.

32:50.635 --> 32:52.783
Ridge analysis proof.

32:52.784 --> 32:54.931
Judge Mason
is...

32:54.973 --> 32:56.964
Paul Millander.

33:00.745 --> 33:02.413
It’s...

33:02.414 --> 33:04.180
It’s Greg.

33:04.181 --> 33:05.947
Come on.

33:12.590 --> 33:13.824
Okay.

33:13.825 --> 33:16.661
The hair you found in Pauline
Millender’s bedroom--

33:16.662 --> 33:18.959
two X chromosomes --
female.

33:18.997 --> 33:19.997
You didn't beep
me for that.

33:19.998 --> 33:24.669
Well, Sara had me compare it to the hair

33:24.670 --> 33:26.871
They're a
perfect match.

33:26.872 --> 33:28.964
DNA identical.

33:29.007 --> 33:31.976
So her brother
planted it?

33:32.010 --> 33:34.145
Well... not exactly.

33:34.146 --> 33:36.225
Yeah, he planted it.

33:36.226 --> 33:38.305
He planted his own hair.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.217
Millander.

33:40.218 --> 33:42.686
It’s a female hair.

33:42.687 --> 33:44.621
With endogenous testosterone.

33:44.622 --> 33:48.353
Pauline was taking
male hormone injections.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.361
Why?

33:51.362 --> 33:54.991
My theory? Sex change.

33:55.033 --> 33:57.695
You know, when I
was back at the house,

33:57.735 --> 34:01.000
I saw several
photographs of Pauline

34:01.039 --> 34:02.706
and nothing of Paul.

34:02.707 --> 34:07.770
In fact, the only proof of Paul is a hidden

34:08.246 --> 34:11.049
There is no birth or
death record for Pauline.

34:11.050 --> 34:13.717
Paul killed Pauline.

34:13.717 --> 34:16.016
But he didn't murder her.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.871
So that's what
you've been hiding?

34:17.873 --> 34:19.688
That your daughter
is now your son?

34:19.690 --> 34:24.889
Pauline went away, and came
back a very strange man.

34:37.074 --> 34:41.034
And I wouldn't let him stay here-- not like

34:41.813 --> 34:44.043
Mrs. Millander, we believe

34:44.081 --> 34:47.051
that your son has
murdered three people,

34:47.085 --> 34:49.887
and that he's living
under the assumed name

34:49.888 --> 34:52.047
of Judge Douglas Mason.

34:52.090 --> 34:54.920
I need your permission
to collect some hairs

34:54.920 --> 34:57.751
from Pauline's bedroom
for use in court.

35:02.066 --> 35:05.770
We took this hair from your childhood

35:05.771 --> 35:08.102
when you used to be Pauline.

35:10.541 --> 35:13.066
They told my parents

35:13.111 --> 35:16.813
I had
an "endocrinic ambiguity."

35:16.814 --> 35:22.081
My chromosomes said female,
but my body wasn't that sure.

35:22.120 --> 35:25.790
The doctors told my
parents to raise me

35:25.791 --> 35:27.781
as they saw fit.

35:31.129 --> 35:34.360
Unfortunately, they disagreed.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.104
So, uh...

35:40.138 --> 35:43.107
You were a girl when
you were inside the house,

35:43.141 --> 35:46.110
and a boy when you
were out in the world?

35:46.144 --> 35:48.578
I managed.

35:50.414 --> 35:52.109
Until...

35:53.317 --> 35:55.376
that night.

36:11.602 --> 36:13.331
A boy...

36:15.173 --> 36:18.540
could
have saved his father.

36:19.043 --> 36:21.942
You did what you could do.

36:21.943 --> 36:24.842
You testified
against them.

36:26.184 --> 36:28.516
Do you see the man who killed your father

36:32.123 --> 36:35.058
Y... Yes.

36:39.297 --> 36:42.130
They went free.

36:42.200 --> 36:46.227
And you started to identify with the

36:51.209 --> 36:53.905
Why are you smiling?

36:54.445 --> 36:56.279
I am...

36:56.280 --> 36:59.182
comfortable...

36:59.183 --> 37:01.344
sharing this with you.

37:02.353 --> 37:03.877
My, uh...

37:05.890 --> 37:09.189
My mother wouldn’t hear it.

37:09.227 --> 37:11.596
Against her wishes, I...

37:11.597 --> 37:14.190
I cut off my hair.

37:14.232 --> 37:16.200
Started wearing big shirts.

37:16.234 --> 37:18.930
Big boots.

37:21.539 --> 37:24.373
If I got tough enough...

37:24.374 --> 37:27.207
no one would ever hurt me.

37:27.245 --> 37:30.214
I went to the clinic...

37:30.248 --> 37:32.230
and became a man.

37:32.231 --> 37:34.213
Sexual reassignment.

37:34.252 --> 37:37.221
Not just a man, though--
a judge.

37:37.255 --> 37:40.625
Doesn't get much
more powerful than that.

37:40.626 --> 37:43.994
But none of it solved your problems, did it?

37:43.995 --> 37:47.431
Or else you wouldn't
have killed three innocent men.

37:54.272 --> 37:56.365
I have a warrant
for your DNA.

37:59.010 --> 38:02.537
ldentity is so
fluid, you know?

38:06.284 --> 38:07.945
May I?

38:28.306 --> 38:30.274
See you in court.

38:30.308 --> 38:33.277
Aren't you wondering about your birthday?

38:33.844 --> 38:36.447
August 17, 1956.

38:36.448 --> 38:37.981
No.

38:37.982 --> 38:40.918
Why I didn't kill you,
since you were next?

38:40.919 --> 38:42.647
No.

38:42.687 --> 38:44.279
I've already picked

38:44.322 --> 38:46.347
my next victim, if you're curious.

38:46.757 --> 38:51.160
It doesn't matter, Paul--
you'll be in jail.

39:05.009 --> 39:07.307
Next up,
People v. Landry.

39:07.345 --> 39:09.677
Are all
the parties present?

39:10.014 --> 39:11.311
What is going on?

39:11.349 --> 39:13.551
I thought Millander was
supposed to be arraigned at 8:00.

39:13.552 --> 39:15.314
This is just
ridiculous.

39:15.353 --> 39:18.355
I mean, you'd think they'd make an

39:18.356 --> 39:21.018
This guy's telling me that Millander is

39:21.058 --> 39:23.492
Pro pers are always last on the docket.

39:52.390 --> 39:55.359
BRASS: A clean-
cut guy in a suit--

39:55.393 --> 39:57.361
no one looks too close.

39:57.395 --> 40:00.364
He must have
got a fake I.D.

40:00.398 --> 40:02.696
He had my I.D.

40:18.983 --> 40:20.382
You going home?

40:20.418 --> 40:22.485
Yeah. They know
where to find me.

40:22.486 --> 40:25.387
I reread the
backgrounds of Millender’s victims

40:25.423 --> 40:27.357
I think that
he slipped up.

40:27.425 --> 40:30.417
You know how every victim
read the suicide note--

40:34.064 --> 40:36.396
Well, Pete Walker
had no mother.

40:41.439 --> 40:43.430
He never slips up.

42:55.573 --> 42:58.542
My name is Paul Millander.

43:02.580 --> 43:07.244
I’m 46 years of age,
and I’m going to kill myself.

43:07.918 --> 43:11.155
l’d like to say "I love you" to my mother,

43:11.156 --> 43:13.521
I’m so sorry.

43:14.525 --> 43:16.026
I never wanted
to put you through this.

43:16.027 --> 43:18.586
I just can't do it anymore.

43:19.196 --> 43:20.925
I've lost hope.
