WEBVTT

00:06.363 --> 00:08.231
Thank you, Mindy,
for letting me stay here

00:08.232 --> 00:09.799
and forcing me to wear matching pajamas

00:09.800 --> 00:12.702
with you and your infant son.

00:12.703 --> 00:14.370
Those actually used to be Danny's.

00:14.371 --> 00:15.772
You're the same size.

00:15.773 --> 00:18.641
Mm. But I should probably get
dressed for work.

00:18.642 --> 00:20.810
What? Sit that tiny butt down.

00:20.811 --> 00:22.745
I already called in sick for you.

00:22.746 --> 00:23.980
But I'm not sick.

00:23.981 --> 00:26.349
My temperature is a normal 92.1 degrees.

00:26.350 --> 00:29.419
I've never wasted a sick day
on actually being sick.

00:29.420 --> 00:31.554
You're heartbroken. You need
to focus on what's important

00:31.555 --> 00:32.922
and nourish your soul.

00:32.923 --> 00:35.091
I'll put Leo down for his nap
and show you what I mean.

00:35.092 --> 00:36.826
Welcome to the whackateria.

00:36.827 --> 00:38.561
Interesting. But just to be clear,

00:38.562 --> 00:39.729
is this pornography

00:39.730 --> 00:41.731
or a documentary
about human trafficking?

00:41.732 --> 00:43.800
Good question. Kind of both.

00:43.801 --> 00:45.568
This is Sploders.com.

00:45.569 --> 00:48.238
It's the Willy Wonka Factory,
but for perverts.

00:48.239 --> 00:50.573
So, what's your sexual thing?
They'll definitely have it.

00:50.574 --> 00:54.010
Oh, no, nothing.
Just normal sex with men.

00:54.011 --> 00:56.179
Anna, sweetheart,

00:56.180 --> 00:59.182
you are far too uptight
to not have a kink, okay?

00:59.183 --> 01:00.817
You can tell me. I'm not gonna judge.

01:00.818 --> 01:04.587
Mine is biracial job interviews.

01:04.587 --> 01:05.989
Hairy backs.

01:05.990 --> 01:08.558
All right. That's a good girl.

01:08.559 --> 01:10.960
"Armenian restaurant owner
breaks in new cook."

01:10.961 --> 01:12.129
This is a good one.

01:14.665 --> 01:16.199
It is hot in kitchen.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.301
Maybe I should take off shirt.

01:18.302 --> 01:20.370
Mindy, didn't you say
you had some laundry to fold?

01:20.371 --> 01:22.272
Oh, no... oh.

01:22.273 --> 01:24.774
Yeah. Yes, I do.

01:24.775 --> 01:26.276
- Horgash likes that.
- Ooh.

♪ Doo-doo-doo it's a beautiful morning ♪

01:35.386 --> 01:37.086
All right.

01:38.689 --> 01:40.690
Oh, God! Karen!

01:40.691 --> 01:42.158
What are you doing in here?

01:42.159 --> 01:43.326
Oh, hey, Morgan.

01:43.327 --> 01:46.763
I changed your closet
into a recording studio.

01:46.764 --> 01:48.798
I hope you don't mind
I moved your shirt and pant.

01:48.799 --> 01:52.402
Hey! Why'd you stop playing, beautiful?

01:52.403 --> 01:56.172
I was really groovin' out there
making our Fruity Pebs.

01:56.173 --> 01:59.375
Morgan, is Karen not
the sickest musician?

01:59.376 --> 02:00.610
I've heard better.

02:00.611 --> 02:01.844
She's got such a unique voice.

02:01.845 --> 02:04.847
It's like Carole King
with real bad allergies.

02:04.848 --> 02:06.516
- Mm-hmm.
- Actually, I don't even have

02:06.517 --> 02:07.717
that much vocal training,

02:07.718 --> 02:09.985
unless you count three years
being a whale caller

02:09.987 --> 02:11.955
for the Alaskan Coast Guard.

02:11.956 --> 02:12.956
Huh?

02:12.957 --> 02:15.625
Hey, um, I have a date with Dina,

02:15.626 --> 02:17.060
the lady who works at the cafeteria.

02:17.061 --> 02:18.895
Dina? She's, like, a smoke show.

02:18.896 --> 02:20.063
- Yeah.
- Are you sure

02:20.064 --> 02:21.064
you got a shot, man?

02:21.065 --> 02:22.432
She laughs at all my jokes.

02:22.433 --> 02:24.734
And I'm not sure she understands
what I'm saying

02:24.735 --> 02:26.402
- 'cause her English is so bad.
- Oh.

02:26.403 --> 02:29.138
But it is on, so I would like
to bring her back here tonight.

02:29.139 --> 02:30.373
Ooh, no can do, buddy.

02:30.374 --> 02:32.609
It's... it's our three-week anniversary,

02:32.610 --> 02:34.611
so we're gonna go to fifth base.

02:34.612 --> 02:36.012
It's a lesbian thing.

02:36.013 --> 02:37.714
- Okay.
- Super important.

02:37.715 --> 02:39.415
No. No, no, no. Good for you guys.

02:39.416 --> 02:40.617
I support you as always.

02:40.618 --> 02:43.786
I'm gonna see if Dina can reschedule.

02:43.787 --> 02:45.622
Aw. God, you're a good friend.

02:45.623 --> 02:46.624
Thanks, bud.

02:48.158 --> 02:51.427
- Big plans this weekend?
- You know. The usual. GTL.

02:51.428 --> 02:53.363
Like "Jersey Shore"? Gym, Tan, Laundry?

02:53.364 --> 02:54.564
Gin, Tonic, Lacework.

02:54.565 --> 02:55.832
Hello, Jeremy.

02:55.833 --> 02:58.568
I was at the coffee shop getting
my morning hot water

02:58.569 --> 03:00.236
and I saw this scone...
would you like it?

03:00.237 --> 03:02.605
Thank you, Anna. That's so considerate.

03:02.606 --> 03:04.374
And people wonder why I always carry

03:04.375 --> 03:06.609
a small jar of currant jam on my person.

03:06.610 --> 03:08.212
- Enjoy.
- Thanks, Anna.

03:10.781 --> 03:12.849
Uh, did you just notice anything?

03:12.850 --> 03:15.118
Yes. The Americans call this a scone,

03:15.119 --> 03:16.986
but it's neither dry nor mealy.

03:16.987 --> 03:19.656
No, dummo. Anna's into you.

03:19.657 --> 03:21.057
No.

03:21.058 --> 03:25.428
I mean, there was this one time where...

03:25.429 --> 03:26.629
no, I mustn't speak of it.

03:26.630 --> 03:28.798
What? You know all my secrets.

03:28.799 --> 03:30.233
I told you my pin number. It's...

03:30.234 --> 03:32.302
8-0-0-8 because it spells "BOOB."

03:32.303 --> 03:33.836
Okay, fine. The night that Anna was

03:33.837 --> 03:34.971
staying at my apartment...

03:34.972 --> 03:37.040
you know, when she left Tim...

03:37.041 --> 03:38.174
she kissed me.

03:38.175 --> 03:39.909
Oh, my God. Why didn't you pounce?

03:39.910 --> 03:41.144
She's so hot.
She's like one of those girls

03:41.145 --> 03:42.512
that tried to drown me at camp.

03:42.513 --> 03:44.681
She was intoxicated,
and she'd just left Tim,

03:44.682 --> 03:46.349
and we work together.

03:46.350 --> 03:47.817
Mindy, it would be inappropriate.

03:47.818 --> 03:50.286
Inappropriate?
Everyone here is inappropriate.

03:50.287 --> 03:51.955
- That's true.
- You got to ask her out.

03:53.123 --> 03:54.190
Hey, Dina.

03:54.191 --> 03:55.591
Can we move our date?

03:55.592 --> 03:57.660
Shh!

03:57.661 --> 03:59.429
Having some roomie drama.

03:59.430 --> 04:00.897
Damn, Karen, I had to get you alone

04:00.898 --> 04:05.201
because your shoulders look so
sharp in that blouse. Come here.

04:05.202 --> 04:07.337
Oh, God!

04:07.338 --> 04:08.972
- I am so sorry.
- Hello? Hello?

04:10.107 --> 04:11.607
Ugh!

04:11.608 --> 04:12.742
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:12.743 --> 04:14.444
Trying to make a sexy phone call.

04:14.445 --> 04:16.212
I'm sorry. I didn't even see you there.

04:16.213 --> 04:18.247
It's just my bangs are getting so long.

04:18.248 --> 04:19.749
You know, I got to say
I had more privacy

04:19.750 --> 04:20.950
when I lived with my grandmother,

04:20.951 --> 04:22.485
and our toilet was in the kitchen.

04:22.486 --> 04:25.755
Excuse me. Get out of the way, please.

04:25.756 --> 04:26.989
Whew.

04:26.990 --> 04:28.124
I got to talk to you.

04:28.125 --> 04:29.726
Do you have anyone in your life

04:29.727 --> 04:32.328
that is just so annoying.

04:32.329 --> 04:34.564
I mean, they're just always
up in your personal space,

04:34.565 --> 04:37.667
and they're not mean...
they're just so annoying!

04:37.668 --> 04:39.235
I know exactly
what you're talking about.

04:39.236 --> 04:42.338
What do you do?

04:42.339 --> 04:44.741
What I do in this instance is

04:44.742 --> 04:47.243
I try to use body language

04:47.244 --> 04:49.145
that is clear and obvious

04:49.146 --> 04:51.381
to indicate that I want them to leave.

04:51.382 --> 04:53.082
Yeah. No, no, no, no, but what
if they just...

04:53.083 --> 04:57.086
they don't understand subtle
communication like me and you?

04:57.087 --> 04:59.055
Get out. You are wasting my time.

04:59.056 --> 05:00.256
I could try saying that to Karen,

05:00.257 --> 05:02.024
but I don't know
how she's gonna take it.

05:02.025 --> 05:04.727
- Morgan, get out.
- Okay, okay. No, no, no.

05:04.728 --> 05:07.697
Morgan, colon, dialogue, "Get out!"

05:07.698 --> 05:09.699
I get it. Will it work?

05:09.700 --> 05:11.501
But you're right.
I've got to stand up for myself.

05:11.502 --> 05:13.102
I'm gonna keep my date with Dina.

05:13.103 --> 05:14.804
Get the hell out of here!

05:14.805 --> 05:17.874
Aah, I know! I can't believe
I've got a hot date too!

05:17.875 --> 05:18.975
Ahh.

05:18.976 --> 05:20.843
Oh, my God. I got to go.

05:20.844 --> 05:22.412
Can't just sit in here
and gab with you all day.

05:22.413 --> 05:24.414
I know you'd love that. Yeah!

05:24.415 --> 05:25.615
Aah!

05:25.616 --> 05:27.150
So I told the TSA woman,

05:27.151 --> 05:29.352
if you're gonna pat down
my breasts for this long,

05:29.353 --> 05:31.554
- I'd like to be paid.
- Excuse me, Jeremy.

05:31.555 --> 05:33.523
I was hoping you could
take a look at Mrs. Suarez.

05:33.524 --> 05:36.192
She wants a second opinion.
Her fetus doesn't like me.

05:36.193 --> 05:38.227
Second opinion? I'm flattered.

05:38.228 --> 05:40.596
People around here
normally ignore my opinions.

05:40.597 --> 05:43.100
Mrs. Suarez is in
the exam room when you're ready.

05:44.368 --> 05:46.068
Now isn't she a breath of fresh air?

05:46.069 --> 05:47.904
Now that she's had a week
to get over her marriage,

05:47.905 --> 05:49.472
I think I'm gonna ask her on a date.

05:49.473 --> 05:50.673
She's the kind of woman

05:50.674 --> 05:52.442
mother would come down
from the attic for.

05:52.443 --> 05:53.910
Hm.

05:53.911 --> 05:56.179
Hey, man, you need
to get on this Anna thing fast.

05:56.180 --> 05:58.414
A girl that hot
does not stay single for long.

05:58.415 --> 06:00.416
I can hear Leonardo DiCaprio
turning his yacht around

06:00.417 --> 06:01.751
as we speak.

06:01.752 --> 06:04.086
Ah, this is so stressful.
I haven't journalled

06:04.087 --> 06:05.922
through my feelings on the topic.

06:06.957 --> 06:08.257
You know what? You're a loser,

06:08.258 --> 06:09.625
and you should stay single till you die,

06:09.626 --> 06:10.726
or you should marry your bird.

06:10.727 --> 06:12.695
Yeah, as if that's legal.

06:12.696 --> 06:15.498
Fine. I like her. I'm gonna ask her out.

06:15.499 --> 06:18.034
I just... as Jody's friend,

06:18.035 --> 06:19.735
I've got to tell him first.

06:19.736 --> 06:21.237
Boo. Male friendships are boring.

06:21.238 --> 06:23.105
The only friendships
worth thinking about are

06:23.106 --> 06:24.507
Gayle and Oprah or, like,

06:24.508 --> 06:27.109
a young African-American boy
and his Jewish chess master.

06:27.110 --> 06:29.345
Yeah, you've already told me
that movie idea.

06:29.346 --> 06:30.780
I love it.

06:30.781 --> 06:31.849
Good luck!

06:33.617 --> 06:34.851
Well, hi, Jeremy. Come on in.

06:34.852 --> 06:35.918
I'm just popping in to let you know

06:35.919 --> 06:37.453
I'm gonna be asking Anna out on a date.

06:37.454 --> 06:38.454
Okay, bye.

06:38.455 --> 06:40.189
Oh, sweetie, no.

06:40.190 --> 06:41.491
Maybe you misheard me.

06:41.492 --> 06:43.392
I'm gonna be asking Anna out.

06:43.393 --> 06:46.496
No. I heard you.
It's just I also like Anna.

06:46.497 --> 06:47.864
And I think she likes me too.

06:47.865 --> 06:49.532
In fact, she kissed me the other day.

06:49.533 --> 06:51.300
So? She kissed me too.

06:51.301 --> 06:53.402
- What?
- And also I called dibs,

06:53.403 --> 06:54.470
and you know the rules.

06:54.471 --> 06:56.005
You can't call dibs on an adult woman

06:56.006 --> 06:59.208
like she's the last comfy chair
at movie night.

06:59.209 --> 07:01.277
Why don't you go find yourself
another nice girl?

07:01.278 --> 07:03.312
As long as it's somebody I
haven't already called dibs on,

07:03.313 --> 07:04.347
you're good to go.

07:04.348 --> 07:05.715
Oh, I see. I see.

07:05.716 --> 07:07.984
I'm meant to let you do
whatever the hell it is you like

07:07.985 --> 07:10.219
just because you're the alpha
and I'm the beta.

07:10.220 --> 07:11.687
Well, I wouldn't put it that way.

07:11.688 --> 07:13.589
I'd say I'm the strong, decisive leader,

07:13.590 --> 07:15.224
and you're the sensitive musical one

07:15.225 --> 07:16.659
who looks up to me, the alpha.

07:16.660 --> 07:18.628
Oh, did I go and say it?

07:18.629 --> 07:20.830
Just because my best friends
are a piano and a bird

07:20.831 --> 07:22.598
doesn't make me the beta.

07:22.599 --> 07:25.102
I'm asking Anna out, and I don't
give a damn what you think.

07:29.276 --> 07:30.916
Tamra, I haven't been
on the social scene

07:30.941 --> 07:32.440
since I fell down the steps
at the opera.

07:32.465 --> 07:34.651
What would be an impressive first date

07:34.676 --> 07:37.747
for a woman that, you know,
I really want to wow.

07:37.748 --> 07:38.915
Now, this is a real woman

07:38.916 --> 07:40.216
and not like the time
you got catfished...

07:40.217 --> 07:42.051
- ...by a man with no arms and no legs.
- By a man with no arms and no legs.

07:42.052 --> 07:43.486
No. This is a real woman, Tamra.

07:43.487 --> 07:45.254
First, take her to dinner at Helsinki.

07:45.255 --> 07:46.789
It's that new ice restaurant

07:46.790 --> 07:48.325
that just opened up in Rhom-Tri.

07:49.426 --> 07:51.294
- The rhombus under Tribeca.
- Okay.

07:51.295 --> 07:52.762
Oh, and then take her to see that play

07:52.763 --> 07:55.164
where Jake Gyllenhaal just moves
furniture around the stage.

07:55.165 --> 07:57.533
- Furniture, Jake Gyllenhaal.
- If you do those two things,

07:57.534 --> 07:59.368
you know what the third thing
you're gonna do is.

07:59.369 --> 08:02.872
The apple crumble for dessert
at Serendipity. Scrumptious.

08:02.873 --> 08:04.373
You might run into Dr. K,
'cause I told him

08:04.374 --> 08:05.675
to do the same stuff with Anna

08:05.676 --> 08:07.076
on their first date tomorrow night.

08:07.077 --> 08:08.411
Jody's already asked Anna out?

08:08.412 --> 08:10.346
He got her dad's permission
and everything.

08:10.347 --> 08:11.681
Who are you asking out?

08:11.682 --> 08:13.082
Your partner from salsa class?

08:13.083 --> 08:14.383
Tamra, you know we have an odd number,

08:14.384 --> 08:16.453
and I am forced to dance
with Instructor Carlos.

08:20.524 --> 08:22.992
Hey, Anna. Wanna prank call
pizza places with me?

08:22.993 --> 08:24.460
I think you'd be really good at it.

08:24.461 --> 08:27.930
I don't think so. I have some
paperwork I need to do tonight.

08:27.931 --> 08:29.566
Okay, well...

08:30.968 --> 08:32.934
Hey, what are you doing here?

08:32.936 --> 08:34.236
I was just in the neighborhood,

08:34.236 --> 08:35.638
and I thought to myself,

08:35.639 --> 08:36.871
"Well, got some Prosecco

08:36.873 --> 08:39.207
"and some strawberries
and clotted cream,

08:39.208 --> 08:40.409
"a jigsaw puzzle.

08:40.409 --> 08:43.578
Why not pop in on my old mate Mindy?"

08:43.580 --> 08:45.848
- Huh? This is weird.
- That's not weird.

08:45.849 --> 08:47.283
Just want to hang out with you,
that's all.

08:47.284 --> 08:49.251
And anyone else who happens to be here.

08:49.252 --> 08:51.287
Oh, Leo. I'm sorry, man.

08:51.288 --> 08:52.388
I don't know how to tell you this,

08:52.389 --> 08:53.522
but he thinks you're lame.

08:53.523 --> 08:54.591
Well, it's...

08:56.326 --> 08:59.128
- Oh, Anna?
- Yes, you idiot.

08:59.129 --> 09:00.796
Jody's taking her on a date
tomorrow night,

09:00.797 --> 09:01.797
so time is of the essence.

09:01.798 --> 09:03.065
Please just help me out.

09:03.066 --> 09:04.967
Anna, guess who's here? It's Jeremy.

09:04.968 --> 09:06.569
Oh, hello, Jeremy.

09:06.570 --> 09:07.803
What are you doing here?

09:07.804 --> 09:08.938
Oh, this is totally normal.

09:08.939 --> 09:10.573
He comes over all the time
to watch movies.

09:10.574 --> 09:12.942
- We eat snotted cream.
- Clotted cream.

09:12.943 --> 09:14.777
But honestly, Jeremy, old chum,

09:14.778 --> 09:16.178
tonight I won't be able to join you

09:16.179 --> 09:18.481
because my bowels are rumblin'.

09:18.482 --> 09:19.782
Just say you're tired.

09:19.783 --> 09:23.319
I feel bad.

09:23.320 --> 09:25.187
Ah, man, well,
I'm gonna call it a night.

09:25.188 --> 09:27.857
For your safety, do not go
near the bathroom.

09:27.858 --> 09:30.059
For God's sake.

09:30.060 --> 09:31.427
Turn the fan on.

09:31.428 --> 09:36.499
So, dare I pour us a snort of Prosecco?

09:36.500 --> 09:38.434
Oh, uh, okay.

09:38.435 --> 09:41.070
But just a splash, because I really need

09:41.071 --> 09:42.571
to finish this paperwork tonight.

09:42.572 --> 09:45.741
I hear you. Work is important.

09:45.742 --> 09:50.046
So, I warn you,
this English clotted cream is

09:50.047 --> 09:51.981
somewhat clottier
than what you're used to.

09:51.982 --> 09:54.017
I wonder if Mindy has a cream caddy.

09:55.852 --> 09:57.620
- This is my room.
- Big.

09:57.621 --> 09:58.821
Yeah. I got the top bunk.

09:58.822 --> 10:01.390
- That's hot.
- Yeah, it is hot.

10:01.391 --> 10:03.559
Do you... do you want a boost?
'Cause I broke the ladder

10:03.560 --> 10:04.894
on Christmas morning...
I came down too...

10:04.895 --> 10:06.696
- Yeah. Sure, sure. Push me up.
- Great, great, great.

10:06.697 --> 10:09.665
Got you. Oh, yeah. Here we go.

10:09.666 --> 10:10.966
Oh, no. Oh.

10:10.967 --> 10:12.068
Pull.

10:12.069 --> 10:13.069
You are big man.

10:13.070 --> 10:14.470
I brac-ed feet.

10:14.471 --> 10:15.838
Just go. Big man.

10:15.839 --> 10:19.241
There we go. Oh, my God.

10:19.242 --> 10:20.776
Morgan, make sex to me.

10:20.777 --> 10:22.745
Oh, your turtleneck... it's so itchy.

10:22.746 --> 10:24.680
Oh, oh, my God. Hey, do me a favor.

10:24.681 --> 10:27.883
Put on the hair net.
Put it on. I got to see it.

10:27.884 --> 10:29.318
Oh, God!

10:29.319 --> 10:31.620
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Oh, no! I'm sorry!

10:31.621 --> 10:33.289
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

10:33.290 --> 10:35.091
I was just... I was recording in there.

10:35.092 --> 10:37.259
I think the microphone
did pick up some kissing noises,

10:37.260 --> 10:39.361
so I am gonna need to get you
to sign a release.

10:39.362 --> 10:40.563
- Stop it.
- Oh, no.

10:40.564 --> 10:43.032
I think I sprained my scooping hand.

10:43.033 --> 10:44.600
I need for the scoop!

10:44.601 --> 10:46.669
I'm finished in the cafeteria.

10:46.670 --> 10:48.637
They'll put me on the registers.

10:48.638 --> 10:49.839
Oh, no, no.

10:49.840 --> 10:51.841
Morgan, I don't want to see you again.

10:51.842 --> 10:53.743
Stay out of my cafeteria.

10:53.744 --> 10:56.612
From now on, you go
to the Garden Street Cafe,

10:56.613 --> 10:59.115
level B1.

10:59.116 --> 11:00.916
- I don't have panini money.
- Level B1.

11:00.917 --> 11:04.019
I can't go. I can't go.
Dina, Dina, Dina!

11:04.020 --> 11:05.955
Oh, my God.

11:05.956 --> 11:08.524
Everywhere I go, Karen, you're there.

11:08.525 --> 11:11.227
Work, home...

11:11.228 --> 11:12.728
those are the only two places I go,

11:12.729 --> 11:13.729
but you're always there.

11:13.730 --> 11:14.764
And I'm gonna say to you

11:14.765 --> 11:16.632
what I say to all the penguins
at the zoo:

11:16.633 --> 11:19.202
"Go back to Alaska, you weirdos!"

11:24.107 --> 11:26.475
Time to dig into this puzzle.

11:26.476 --> 11:29.211
Um, I actually...
I have some stuff I need to do.

11:29.212 --> 11:32.448
Oh, but it's of the doors
of Rochester, New York.

11:32.449 --> 11:35.117
- My hometown?
- Is it?

11:35.118 --> 11:36.919
Is it really? What a coincidence

11:36.920 --> 11:39.522
that my random choice

11:39.523 --> 11:41.991
should have some personal
significance to you.

11:41.992 --> 11:44.293
Okay, here we go.

11:44.294 --> 11:47.463
Okay, so, the easiest way is

11:47.464 --> 11:49.331
finding the corners.

11:49.332 --> 11:51.000
- Jeremy...
- It's actually easiest

11:51.001 --> 11:52.568
because they're
in a very specific shape.

11:52.569 --> 11:54.103
- I don't want to do this.
- They're in a rectangle,

11:54.104 --> 11:55.638
and we don't need to worry
with these little knobbly bits.

11:55.639 --> 11:56.639
- Jeremy, please put it away.
- And then we

11:56.640 --> 11:57.773
lay down the corners, and then...

11:57.774 --> 11:58.841
Please put the puzzle away.

11:58.842 --> 12:00.143
I don't want to do this.

12:03.180 --> 12:06.048
I misjudged it. I'm so sorry.

12:06.049 --> 12:07.116
My mistake.

12:07.117 --> 12:08.351
Aah!

12:12.189 --> 12:13.756
Oh, no, no, no, Anna, don't cry.

12:13.757 --> 12:15.457
The puzzle's fine. The puzzle's okay.

12:15.458 --> 12:18.260
These papers took the brunt of it.

12:18.261 --> 12:20.197
"State of New York divorce filing"?

12:21.865 --> 12:24.767
Oh, Anna, I'm sorry.

12:24.768 --> 12:26.235
It's okay.

12:28.338 --> 12:30.306
I'm sorry if I was short with you.

12:30.307 --> 12:31.640
No, no. Come on.

12:31.641 --> 12:33.275
It's just I got to the part
in the paperwork

12:33.276 --> 12:36.345
where I have to list
Tim's transgressions,

12:36.346 --> 12:39.482
which hasn't been easy
because there's been so many.

12:40.550 --> 12:42.651
Maybe I could help.

12:42.652 --> 12:45.087
No, I actually helped my mother
with her divorce paperwork

12:45.088 --> 12:46.288
from father,

12:46.289 --> 12:50.025
and then later when she divorced
Sheik Mahmoud.

12:50.026 --> 12:53.796
Why don't you tell me what to write,

12:53.797 --> 12:55.231
and I'll write it down?

12:55.232 --> 12:57.199
- You would do that?
- Of course.

12:57.200 --> 12:59.902
You know, I actually became
a doctor for the paperwork.

12:59.903 --> 13:00.903
Heh.

13:03.373 --> 13:04.373
Morgan!

13:04.374 --> 13:05.674
Hey! Whoa! No, no, no, no, no.

13:05.675 --> 13:07.409
Hey! Hey! I got the sign up!

13:07.410 --> 13:10.045
Come on, man.

13:10.046 --> 13:12.047
Why did I get a text from my girlfriend

13:12.048 --> 13:14.717
saying she's not coming
to our apartment anymore?

13:14.718 --> 13:16.352
Because she ruined my night of passion.

13:16.353 --> 13:18.520
That is not passion.

13:18.521 --> 13:20.022
Let me tell you something.
I got Dina back here.

13:20.023 --> 13:22.458
Finally. And we were
getting in our underwear,

13:22.459 --> 13:24.293
and all of a sudden,
Karen pops out of my closet

13:24.294 --> 13:26.362
like a ghost, and I fling Dina
across the room.

13:26.363 --> 13:27.963
You know how hard it is to get a woman

13:27.964 --> 13:29.064
to come back to your apartment

13:29.065 --> 13:31.267
when you live 85 stops off the subway.

13:31.268 --> 13:32.902
I'm just gonna be real with you.
Your girlfriend's

13:32.903 --> 13:34.470
- really annoying.
- Mm.

13:34.471 --> 13:36.005
Yeah, she's always
running around this apartment

13:36.006 --> 13:37.106
practicing her yo-yo,

13:37.107 --> 13:38.874
and she hit one of my dogs in the eye,

13:38.875 --> 13:40.409
and he has to wear an eye patch.

13:40.410 --> 13:42.044
Scooter looks like an idiot!

13:42.045 --> 13:43.579
- Scooter is an idiot!
- You're an idiot!

13:43.580 --> 13:46.081
Arg! It's clobbering time!

13:48.000 --> 13:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:04.134 --> 14:07.469
Stop. Tap out. Tap out. Oh, oh!

14:07.470 --> 14:11.840
Okay, I can't afford steroids like you.

14:11.841 --> 14:14.276
I won't put you in another headlock,

14:14.277 --> 14:15.978
but you got to listen to me.

14:15.979 --> 14:18.614
Karen was the first girl I've
liked in a really long time,

14:18.615 --> 14:20.517
and you messed it up.

14:23.486 --> 14:24.954
I'm going for a bike ride.

14:24.955 --> 14:26.722
Colette, I...

14:26.723 --> 14:28.324
Colette, I'm sorry.

14:28.325 --> 14:29.892
Colette, come back here, please.

14:29.893 --> 14:32.094
I'm sorry!

14:32.095 --> 14:33.896
Et tu, Scooter?

14:37.200 --> 14:39.435
He cheated on me constantly.

14:39.436 --> 14:41.670
He slept with the caterer
during the father-daughter dance

14:41.671 --> 14:43.038
at our wedding.

14:43.039 --> 14:44.707
I could hear his moans from the closet

14:44.708 --> 14:46.575
over Suga Suga's "How'd You Get So Fly."

14:46.576 --> 14:49.145
I'll just put "various infidelities."

14:50.714 --> 14:53.015
Thank you for helping me
with this, Jeremy.

14:53.016 --> 14:54.817
It really has made it a lot easier.

14:54.818 --> 14:56.251
Well, you know, I like being here,

14:56.252 --> 14:57.653
even under the circumstances.

15:01.024 --> 15:03.859
Oh, it's the hospital.

15:03.860 --> 15:05.862
I guess one of my patients went
into labor early.

15:08.732 --> 15:11.467
I really do appreciate
the company tonight, Jeremy.

15:11.468 --> 15:13.435
- Oh.
- Oh, and, um,

15:13.436 --> 15:15.738
if you wouldn't mind checking
on Mindy...

15:15.739 --> 15:17.539
I think she fell asleep on the toilet.

15:17.540 --> 15:18.575
Right.

15:20.043 --> 15:21.343
Dr. Ziev is on her way.

15:21.344 --> 15:23.178
What birthing suite would you
like for us to prep?

15:23.179 --> 15:24.546
Oh, that won't be necessary.

15:24.547 --> 15:28.350
But could you find me an ice bucket?

15:28.351 --> 15:31.481
Never mind. I'll just fill a
bedpan with ice from the morgue.

15:38.838 --> 15:40.839
Uh, what are you doing

15:40.864 --> 15:43.232
on the floor of the scrub-in room?

15:43.233 --> 15:44.967
Well, I just couldn't wait
for our date tomorrow,

15:44.968 --> 15:48.170
so I decided to throw you
a spontaneous picnic.

15:48.171 --> 15:50.139
I'm sorry. Did you just take
a photograph of me?

15:50.140 --> 15:52.741
I just want to document the moment.

15:52.742 --> 15:54.877
Can I pour you some rosé?

15:54.878 --> 15:56.612
No. I can't drink.

15:56.613 --> 15:58.347
I got called in for a procedure.

15:58.348 --> 15:59.848
Well, good news!

15:59.849 --> 16:01.517
I made that up to get you here.

16:01.518 --> 16:03.519
Yay, romantic ruse!

16:03.520 --> 16:05.721
Would you like a water cracker?

16:05.722 --> 16:07.556
Are you out of your mind?

16:07.557 --> 16:10.325
I just called Stephanie Ruiz's husband

16:10.326 --> 16:12.161
in Afghanistan.

16:12.162 --> 16:13.562
Oops.

16:13.563 --> 16:15.197
But now that you're here,

16:15.198 --> 16:17.699
why don't you take a seat?

16:17.700 --> 16:18.834
This is insane.

16:18.835 --> 16:20.169
And unhygienic.

16:20.170 --> 16:21.637
Do you have any idea how much placenta

16:21.638 --> 16:23.105
must have been tracked on this floor?

16:23.106 --> 16:24.540
I took a wet wipe to it.

16:24.541 --> 16:25.908
I'm leaving.

16:25.909 --> 16:27.476
For one thing, I'm not comfortable

16:27.477 --> 16:31.713
with how close those candles are
to that oxygen tank.

16:31.714 --> 16:33.182
Oh, idiots.

16:33.183 --> 16:34.850
How'd it go with Anna?

16:34.851 --> 16:36.985
You know, I think I laid
some really good groundwork.

16:36.986 --> 16:39.188
I was a great shoulder to cry on,

16:39.189 --> 16:40.355
very masculine,

16:40.356 --> 16:41.890
and also I took your advice

16:41.891 --> 16:44.626
and didn't once mention my harp
lessons or sleeping gloves.

16:44.627 --> 16:46.762
Oh, my God, Jeremy. This might happen.

16:46.763 --> 16:48.764
Oh, I'm gonna give
the best speech at your wedding.

16:50.100 --> 16:51.934
Ooh, you're blowing up.
Let's see who it is.

16:51.935 --> 16:53.802
Mm.

16:53.803 --> 16:54.971
Oh.

16:56.039 --> 16:57.139
Never mind.

16:57.140 --> 16:58.440
There's not gonna be a wedding.

16:58.441 --> 17:00.542
I mean, unless it's
between Anna and Jody.

17:00.543 --> 17:03.445
- All is lost.
- What are you talking about?

17:03.446 --> 17:06.048
Oh, come on.

17:06.049 --> 17:07.715
Hey, man, I'm really sorry.

17:07.717 --> 17:10.285
But you know what? I'm not gonna
go to their wedding.

17:10.286 --> 17:13.521
But they're both really rich.
It'll be really fun.

17:13.522 --> 17:15.557
You know what? I'm not gonna
go to their brunch.

17:15.558 --> 17:17.359
I never do. I'm always too hungover.

17:19.162 --> 17:20.163
Thanks?

17:22.531 --> 17:25.032
- Hey, Karen.
- Morgan! Oh, my gosh.

17:25.034 --> 17:27.502
Oh, my gosh.
I am so sorry about yesterday.

17:27.503 --> 17:29.538
That was my second-worst
coming out of the closet.

17:29.539 --> 17:32.341
The third was telling my parents
I was gay.

17:32.342 --> 17:35.077
Wait. I'm sorry.
You're apologizing to me?

17:35.078 --> 17:37.846
I wrote you a song on the
ukulele to make up for it.

17:37.847 --> 17:40.582
It's called "When Morgans Cry."

17:40.583 --> 17:44.253
♪ How could I anger such a large man? ♪

17:44.254 --> 17:47.356
Shh, shh, shh. Stop, stop, stop.

17:47.357 --> 17:48.891
I appreciate that gesture,

17:48.892 --> 17:50.325
and I know you're trying.

17:50.326 --> 17:54.363
The singing is the core problem
I'm having with you.

17:54.364 --> 17:56.765
I know that I can be pretty irritating.

17:56.766 --> 17:58.834
Do you know that I had to leave Alaska

17:58.835 --> 18:00.936
because I was so annoying?

18:00.937 --> 18:05.007
They sent me into Canada on
a dog sled while I was asleep.

18:05.008 --> 18:08.277
I have not always been
this charismatic chick magnet

18:08.278 --> 18:10.279
- that stands before you.
- Really?

18:10.280 --> 18:11.380
You know what I've been called?

18:11.381 --> 18:13.081
Annoying.

18:13.082 --> 18:14.550
They made a movie about me on Lifetime

18:14.551 --> 18:16.618
called "Unbearable:
The Morgan Tookers Story."

18:16.619 --> 18:17.686
- Whoa.
- I've been called

18:17.687 --> 18:19.021
a lot of stuff: intolerable,

18:19.022 --> 18:20.622
bad storyteller,

18:20.623 --> 18:22.691
the worst thing ever
on the Lifetime network.

18:22.692 --> 18:27.162
My high school paid me $100 to
not go to my ten-year reunion.

18:27.163 --> 18:29.164
Maybe you and I have more
in common than I thought.

18:29.165 --> 18:31.033
And we've both been in Colette's pants.

18:31.034 --> 18:32.734
- Oh.
- I'm wearing them right now.

18:32.735 --> 18:34.236
- Oh!
- Yeah. I spilled...

18:34.237 --> 18:36.138
one of the Mexican corns on my pants.

18:36.139 --> 18:37.839
- Oh, yeah. Uh-oh.
- Yeah, I know.

18:37.840 --> 18:39.308
We got to make this work.

18:39.309 --> 18:42.311
Okay. I promise I'm gonna
be real normal from now on.

18:42.312 --> 18:43.679
You won't regret it.

18:43.680 --> 18:45.080
There you go.

18:45.081 --> 18:48.684
♪ How could I anger such a large man? ♪

18:48.685 --> 18:50.219
I'll give it back to you later on.

18:50.220 --> 18:51.453
Oh, okay.

18:51.454 --> 18:52.654
See you later.

18:54.857 --> 18:55.925
Oh.

18:57.327 --> 18:58.727
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

18:58.728 --> 19:01.630
This is the downtown local.

19:01.631 --> 19:04.700
Station stop is 72nd Street.

19:04.701 --> 19:08.070
Stand clear
of the closing doors, please.

19:08.071 --> 19:11.074
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Jeremy.

19:14.210 --> 19:15.844
You know what? No.

19:15.845 --> 19:18.880
It's... it's not a good morning.
It's a bad morning!

19:18.881 --> 19:21.617
What you did yesterday was ungentlemanly

19:21.618 --> 19:22.784
and unsportsmanlike,

19:22.785 --> 19:25.254
and just... just really shitty.

19:25.255 --> 19:28.223
I liked Anna, Jody. I really liked her.

19:28.224 --> 19:30.292
And I am sick of only being allowed

19:30.293 --> 19:31.727
to date women that you've passed on.

19:31.728 --> 19:33.962
Well, guess what.
From now on, I call dibs...

19:33.963 --> 19:36.365
on everyone in this subway,

19:36.366 --> 19:38.433
everyone in the entire world.

19:38.434 --> 19:41.703
On... on... on that one.
And on that one there.

19:41.704 --> 19:43.305
And that Asian woman.

19:43.306 --> 19:47.643
And on S. Epatha Merkerson
on that ad for "Chicago Med,"

19:47.644 --> 19:49.177
which looks pretty good...
got to be honest.

19:49.178 --> 19:51.246
And on her!

19:51.247 --> 19:52.648
I...

19:52.649 --> 19:54.716
You know what? Good for you.
I was hoping this would happen.

19:54.717 --> 19:56.418
You've finally stood up for yourself.

19:56.419 --> 19:59.054
Now I can cancel my date
with Anna tonight.

19:59.055 --> 20:00.555
- Really?
- You know this whole

20:00.556 --> 20:02.024
dating thing was just a trick

20:02.025 --> 20:03.659
to get you to stand up for yourself.

20:03.660 --> 20:05.627
Oh, my God.

20:05.628 --> 20:07.229
She rejected you, didn't she?

20:07.230 --> 20:08.497
No, no. That is wrong.

20:08.498 --> 20:11.733
I tricked her into thinking
she rejected me.

20:11.734 --> 20:13.602
She rejected you,

20:13.603 --> 20:15.971
and that must mean that she likes me.

20:15.972 --> 20:17.806
But only because I wanted it.

20:17.807 --> 20:20.575
Let's not forget I am
the victorious party here.

20:20.576 --> 20:24.680
She likes me. Whoo!

20:24.681 --> 20:26.114
Aah!

20:26.115 --> 20:27.582
Good morning, Jeremy.

20:27.583 --> 20:29.418
I just wanted to thank you
for last night.

20:29.419 --> 20:31.553
I was so emotional
I snapped the handles off

20:31.554 --> 20:32.821
an elliptical machine.

20:32.822 --> 20:34.623
I don't know what I would have
done without you.

20:34.624 --> 20:36.926
Anna, you don't need to say any more.

20:41.264 --> 20:43.098
I understand completely.

20:43.099 --> 20:45.167
And I feel the same way.

20:45.168 --> 20:47.102
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:47.103 --> 20:48.537
- Oh, my God.
- What are you doing?

20:48.538 --> 20:50.072
I'm so sorry. It's just...

20:50.073 --> 20:52.507
you rejected Jody,
and I thought that maybe...

20:52.508 --> 20:53.709
Oh, for Christ's sake.

20:53.710 --> 20:56.211
- Oh.
- Come with me.

20:56.212 --> 20:57.813
Everyone,

20:57.814 --> 20:59.114
I have an announcement.

20:59.115 --> 21:01.016
I am currently going through a divorce.

21:01.017 --> 21:03.418
This is not easy for me as a WASP.

21:03.419 --> 21:06.054
I am not comfortable talking about love,

21:06.055 --> 21:08.423
money, lawyers, hardship...

21:08.424 --> 21:10.926
basically anything besides the weather

21:10.927 --> 21:12.661
and a few select towns in Connecticut.

21:12.662 --> 21:13.662
But for the record,

21:13.663 --> 21:15.597
I did not leave my cheating husband

21:15.598 --> 21:17.065
because I'm dying to date

21:17.066 --> 21:20.035
one of the tiny number of men
in this office.

21:20.036 --> 21:21.336
I disagree.

21:21.337 --> 21:23.638
- I don't know your name.
- It's Morgan.

21:23.639 --> 21:25.407
Homegirl, there's no use
putting up a fight.

21:25.408 --> 21:27.008
I gave the same exact speech,

21:27.009 --> 21:28.643
and then, against all laws of nature,

21:28.644 --> 21:30.679
ended up dating Morgan for two years.

21:30.680 --> 21:31.680
He was terrible.

21:31.681 --> 21:33.014
I disagree.

21:33.015 --> 21:35.183
There's something very wrong
with this office.

21:35.184 --> 21:36.585
We don't all have to date each other

21:36.586 --> 21:38.854
just because we're in close
proximity to one another, okay?

21:38.855 --> 21:40.355
Normal offices don't work like that.

21:40.356 --> 21:43.492
So, please, don't hit on me

21:43.493 --> 21:45.193
and don't try to kiss me.

21:45.194 --> 21:48.263
I won't like it.

21:48.264 --> 21:50.699
Thank you for your time.

21:50.700 --> 21:52.968
Hey, do you think that
applies to women too?

21:52.969 --> 21:54.669
- No, mm-mm.
- Wow.

21:54.670 --> 21:57.139
That was pretty embarrassing
for the pair of us.

21:57.140 --> 21:58.874
Let's never speak of it again.

21:58.875 --> 22:00.342
Drink the memories away in your office?

22:00.343 --> 22:02.077
Way ahead of you, brother.
