00:00.422 --> 00:01.814
<i>So here's what you missed
on Glee.</i>

00:01.838 --> 00:03.175
<i>The Glee club is officially over</i>

00:03.206 --> 00:05.013
<i>because the New Directions
didn't win a Nationals.</i>

00:05.036 --> 00:07.297
<i>And since Sue's principal are only
*** at McKinley,</i>

00:07.320 --> 00:08.861
<i>She made good *** promise
to cancel it.</i>

00:08.884 --> 00:09.346
Hold up.

00:09.377 --> 00:12.192
<i>Which means if Will wants to coach
a Glee club, he has to find a new job</i>

00:12.224 --> 00:13.048
<i>and he's got a baby on the way!</i>

00:13.082 --> 00:14.750
- Oh, God, that's awful.
- <i>Blaine got into NYADA,</i>

00:14.784 --> 00:16.050
<i>Artie's at film school</i>
<i>in Brooklyn,</i>

00:16.085 --> 00:17.553
<i>and Sam's not going to college,</i>

00:17.587 --> 00:19.688
<i>but he's in New York to try</i>
<i>his luck at modeling.</i>

00:19.722 --> 00:21.690
So I'm going to skip college,
too, and become a male model.

00:21.724 --> 00:23.225
Impossible. You're too fat.

00:23.259 --> 00:25.394
<i>And Santana and Brittany are</i>
<i>off on an extended vacation</i>

00:25.428 --> 00:27.108
<i>in the Greek isles,</i>
<i>and Rachel's six months</i>

00:27.130 --> 00:29.231
<i>into her dream of playing</i>
<i>Fanny Brice in</i> Funny Girl

00:29.265 --> 00:31.200
<i>that's about to open on</i>
<i>Broadway real soon. Exciting!</i>

00:31.234 --> 00:33.784
<i>And that's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee.

00:35.580 --> 00:39.383
Rachel, Rachel,
please, just a minute.

00:39.417 --> 00:41.518
I'm-I'm sorry, Sidney,
I'm actually kind of late.

00:41.553 --> 00:43.020
I have to go
and meet my friends.

00:43.054 --> 00:44.615
Oh, that's not gonna
be a problem. Look,

00:44.622 --> 00:47.424
I know this has been a couple
of very long months for you,

00:47.459 --> 00:48.759
but you've been a trooper.

00:48.793 --> 00:51.628
I mean, you know, having
to do the show on the road,

00:51.663 --> 00:53.030
Santana quitting,

00:53.064 --> 00:55.299
us having to re-stage
the entire play.

00:55.333 --> 00:58.369
I just wanted to say thank you.
Thank you so much, Sidney.

00:58.403 --> 01:00.738
No, no, no.
This is how I say thank you.

01:02.407 --> 01:03.974
24/7, on call.

01:04.009 --> 01:05.209
Is this for me?

01:05.242 --> 01:07.711
Mm-hmm.

01:07.746 --> 01:11.949
No more crowded subways
in New York for my star.

01:11.983 --> 01:13.317
So...

01:14.619 --> 01:15.919
Thank you.

01:15.954 --> 01:19.323
Now, the only question is:

01:19.357 --> 01:21.992
where would
Ms. Berry like to go?

01:23.828 --> 01:25.796

I can call him any time of day,
he's amazing.

04:02.554 --> 04:04.421
He doesn't even say a word.
It's like living

04:04.456 --> 04:06.457
in a high-end coffee commercial
every day.

04:06.491 --> 04:08.492
Unbelievable.
So, where we going for lunch?

04:08.526 --> 04:10.661
Someplace cheap or free?

04:10.695 --> 04:12.963
No, it is my treat and my ride.

04:12.998 --> 04:15.165
You guys have been so great
and so emotionally supportive

04:15.200 --> 04:17.401
of me during the entire
out of town <i> Funny Girl</i> run.

04:17.435 --> 04:18.668
And for your move
back to the loft,

04:18.702 --> 04:21.272
which you never carried
your own clothes or furniture.

04:21.305 --> 04:22.906
It's heavy.

04:22.941 --> 04:24.475
Come on, we're going.
We're gonna go the Odeon.

04:24.509 --> 04:26.944
Okay, like, I've been
really good lately.

04:26.978 --> 04:29.813
- Oh, you have.
- Everyone from Broadway goes.

04:29.848 --> 04:32.049
And it's so cool! I don't know,
probably just like...

04:32.083 --> 04:33.717
rather than getting
a side salad.

04:33.752 --> 04:35.286
Can we pop the trunk?

04:35.320 --> 04:36.754
Trunk is full.
Can I sit in the front then?

04:36.788 --> 04:37.921
Full, too.

04:37.956 --> 04:40.024
Well...

04:40.058 --> 04:42.159
Oh, it's okay. Sam and I
can just meet you there.

04:42.193 --> 04:43.794
Right, Sam?
Are you sure?

04:44.296 --> 04:45.996
I guess.

04:46.031 --> 04:47.531
Thank you.

04:51.870 --> 04:53.637

breakfast in bed

05:23.368 --> 05:25.302

05:25.337 --> 05:26.577
Oh, that does smell good.

05:26.605 --> 05:27.905
Lemon blueberry pancakes.

05:27.939 --> 05:29.406
And the Sunday <i> Chronicle.</i>

05:29.441 --> 05:30.874
Wha...? It's not even Sunday!

05:30.909 --> 05:32.042
They put the Arts
and Leisure section

05:32.077 --> 05:33.877
and Style section on Wednesday.

05:33.912 --> 05:35.045
You know me so well.

05:35.080 --> 05:36.647
Is there anything
I can do to help?

05:36.681 --> 05:37.748
You can check

05:37.782 --> 05:40.262
if the coffee is steeped
enough to press.

05:45.190 --> 05:46.924
I still can't believe it.

05:46.958 --> 05:48.025
We're really doing it.

05:48.059 --> 05:50.527
Living together.
Building a future together.

05:50.562 --> 05:52.596
In Bushwick.
Did you ever imagine that?

05:52.631 --> 05:55.733
It's actually way, way better.

05:55.767 --> 05:57.368

05:57.402 --> 05:59.503
I get to walk you to the subway.

05:59.537 --> 06:01.171
Then walk you to class.

06:01.206 --> 06:02.706
And most days I get
to have lunch with you.

06:02.741 --> 06:05.309
And even after all
of that amazingness,

06:05.343 --> 06:06.877
I get to come home to you.

06:06.912 --> 06:10.247
And I get to curl up in bed with
you, get under the covers...

06:10.282 --> 06:12.549

06:12.584 --> 06:13.684

08:19.945 --> 08:21.385

08:25.217 --> 08:26.317
Good job.

08:27.519 --> 08:29.153
Okay, I know Sam is your bestie,

08:29.187 --> 08:30.688
but he said he'd only
be couch-surfing

08:30.722 --> 08:32.523
with us for a few weeks.
I know.

08:32.557 --> 08:34.592
It's been months, okay?

08:34.626 --> 08:35.960
This apartment has
too many people in it.

08:35.994 --> 08:37.193
You've got to talk to him.

08:37.229 --> 08:40.030
I...

08:41.482 --> 08:43.243
<i>New York, new Artie.</i>

08:43.268 --> 08:45.202
<i>It was scary at first.</i>

08:45.237 --> 08:47.605
<i>No space, no ramp van,</i>
<i>not cut-outs in the curbs.</i>

08:47.639 --> 08:48.739

08:48.773 --> 08:50.341

08:50.375 --> 08:51.942
<i>The city's alive,</i>
<i>always moving,</i>

08:51.977 --> 08:53.511
<i>and I didn't know</i>
<i>if I'd be able to keep up.</i>

08:53.545 --> 08:54.912
<i>But then I realized</i>

08:54.946 --> 08:56.447
<i>I'm in a city</i>
<i>where everybody walks,</i>

08:56.481 --> 08:58.716

08:58.750 --> 09:00.551

09:01.887 --> 09:04.054
<i>All of the cabdrivers</i>
<i>in New York</i>

09:04.089 --> 09:05.556
<i>are required to take</i>
<i>wheelchairs,</i>

09:05.590 --> 09:06.957

09:11.830 --> 09:14.598
<i>There's music,</i>
<i>there's people, there's life.</i>

09:14.633 --> 09:17.001
<i>And at the end of the day,</i>
<i>that's what I came here for.</i>

09:27.412 --> 09:29.079

09:37.088 --> 09:40.791
Bro, just completed Aqua
Park and Millennium Mines.

09:40.826 --> 09:43.460
Now I'm ruling

09:43.495 --> 09:44.929
<i>RollerCoaster Tycoon.</i>

09:44.963 --> 09:46.397

09:46.431 --> 09:47.832
Sam, you've been sitting there

09:47.866 --> 09:49.467
since I left this morning.

09:49.501 --> 09:52.269
You-you've basically been
in that exact same spot

09:52.304 --> 09:53.938
for months.

09:53.972 --> 09:55.639
Yeah, well, Kurt's fancy
wire chairs hurt my back,

09:55.674 --> 09:57.441
so this thing's the only thing
that's comfortable.

09:57.476 --> 09:59.310
Look...

09:59.344 --> 10:02.346
Uh, Kurt and I were talking.

10:02.380 --> 10:03.981
And, um, we just...
You want me to move out.

10:04.015 --> 10:06.050
I knew it. You know what?

10:06.084 --> 10:07.051
Santana got
to stay here forever.

10:07.085 --> 10:09.086
We don't want you to move,

10:09.120 --> 10:10.254
per se, although it isn't

10:10.288 --> 10:12.223
the worst idea I've ever heard.

10:12.257 --> 10:13.457
We're just,

10:13.492 --> 10:14.692
we're worried about you, man.

10:14.693 --> 10:17.094
We know that work has been slow.

10:17.129 --> 10:18.395
Try nonexistent, okay?

10:18.430 --> 10:19.964
I've had
zero modeling auditions.

10:19.998 --> 10:21.165
Zero.

10:21.199 --> 10:22.800
I can't even get my
agent on the phone.

10:22.834 --> 10:24.502
I just get
her lazy assistant Pam

10:24.536 --> 10:26.403
who's like well, maybe
I should cut my hair

10:26.438 --> 10:28.038
because I look
like a dirty hippie.

10:28.073 --> 10:28.994
Well, maybe you should.

10:29.007 --> 10:29.974
But I like it.

10:30.008 --> 10:31.375
Okay, besides Mr. Shue said

10:31.409 --> 10:32.576
that we shouldn't care
what people think.

10:32.611 --> 10:34.578
We should just be ourselves.

10:34.613 --> 10:36.280
What a load of crap, huh?

10:36.314 --> 10:40.518
Well, Mr. Shue also said...

10:40.552 --> 10:42.753
we should face our fears.

10:42.788 --> 10:44.321
Remember that one?
So...

10:44.356 --> 10:46.290
Buddy, I know this
is frustrating...

10:46.324 --> 10:47.825
Maybe I just shouldn't
even be here, okay?

10:47.859 --> 10:48.859
I hate New York, okay?

10:48.894 --> 10:50.427
It's crowded, it's loud,

10:50.462 --> 10:51.695
it smells like garbage

10:51.730 --> 10:53.330
and everybody here is basically
paid to be rude to you.

10:53.365 --> 10:55.032
Sometimes,

10:55.066 --> 10:57.134
it's just easier
if you stay inside.

10:58.336 --> 10:59.303
All right.

10:59.337 --> 11:01.138
Get up. Get up.

11:01.173 --> 11:03.340
I-I don't want to watch you
waste away in here

11:03.375 --> 11:05.342
when there is so
much to do out there.

11:05.377 --> 11:07.077
Put on a clean shirt.

11:07.112 --> 11:09.080
That's got, like,
five kinds of stains on it.

11:09.114 --> 11:10.214
Come on, follow me.

11:10.248 --> 11:11.215
We're going outside.

11:11.249 --> 11:13.150

13:21.079 --> 13:24.415
Hey, if you can sing in
the middle of Times Square,

13:24.449 --> 13:25.916
you can pretty much
do anything.

13:25.951 --> 13:27.451
I think it's time for you
to conquer this city.

13:27.486 --> 13:28.619
I don't know why
they call it Times Square.

13:28.653 --> 13:29.820
I don't see any clocks.

13:37.349 --> 13:40.251
Every art has its instrument.

13:40.286 --> 13:42.020
The violinist

13:42.054 --> 13:43.221
has his violin.

13:43.255 --> 13:45.090
The sculptor...

13:45.124 --> 13:47.158
has his stone.

13:47.193 --> 13:49.661
And the mime...

13:49.695 --> 13:51.096
has his body.

13:51.130 --> 13:53.765
Let us begin our work today
with the mime's

13:53.799 --> 13:56.668
most heartbreaking expression

13:56.702 --> 13:59.771
of his accursed, silent ennui:

13:59.805 --> 14:03.408
the pulling of
the invisible rope

14:03.442 --> 14:04.809
attached to something heavy.

14:14.920 --> 14:16.254
Psst.

14:16.288 --> 14:17.528
Psst.

14:19.358 --> 14:20.492
What are you doing here?

14:20.526 --> 14:22.160
This is a winter master class

14:22.194 --> 14:24.162
taught by Marcel Marceau's
illegitimate son Alain.

14:24.196 --> 14:25.463
You're-you're a freshman.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.532
I got special permission
from Madame Tibideaux.

14:27.566 --> 14:29.434
Turns out I'm in six
out of eight of your classes.

14:29.468 --> 14:30.535
How is that even possible?

14:30.569 --> 14:32.103
Stop talking!

14:32.138 --> 14:34.806
And now we will move on

14:34.840 --> 14:38.443
to the mime's most
tragic expression

14:38.477 --> 14:41.913
of the pointlessness
of man's existence.

14:41.947 --> 14:44.582
We are walking down the street,

14:44.617 --> 14:47.552
without a worry,
a care in the world,

14:47.586 --> 14:49.821
and suddenly we begin to notice

14:49.855 --> 14:51.523
that we are walking in place

14:51.557 --> 14:53.558
but we are not going anywhere.

14:56.262 --> 14:57.896
Have you asked Sam
to move out yet?

14:57.930 --> 14:59.230
We haven't had
a moment to ourselves.

14:59.265 --> 15:00.598
And now,

15:00.633 --> 15:02.967
we will stop to pick a flower.

15:04.336 --> 15:06.137
And in front of your eyes,

15:06.172 --> 15:07.806
the flower dies.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.407
Hey.

15:09.442 --> 15:11.876
Are you sure it's not me
who's crowding you?

15:11.911 --> 15:13.945
No, why would you say that?

15:13.979 --> 15:15.146
Good.

15:15.181 --> 15:17.182
I was really worried
I was suffocating you.

15:17.216 --> 15:19.684
So maybe after this,
we can get lunch?

15:19.719 --> 15:21.186
'Cause then we have Theatre
History class together

15:21.220 --> 15:22.854
and Auditioning for the
Camera class together...

15:22.888 --> 15:25.323
And now, you are trapped

15:25.357 --> 15:27.692
with the person next to you
in a box.

15:27.726 --> 15:29.527
At first, the box

15:29.562 --> 15:31.229
seems big enough
for the two of you.

15:31.263 --> 15:34.432
But then, the box
begins to shrink.

15:34.467 --> 15:35.900
The box where you live

15:35.935 --> 15:38.370
because that is all
a mime can afford.

15:38.404 --> 15:41.773
Getting smaller and smaller...

15:41.807 --> 15:45.577
and smaller... and smaller...

15:45.611 --> 15:47.212
and smaller.

15:49.991 --> 15:51.592
<i>It's that time.</i>

15:51.617 --> 15:53.952
<i>Time for change.</i>
<i>Reinvention.</i>

15:53.986 --> 15:57.288
<i>Rebirth.</i>
<i>That's what NYC is all about.</i>

15:57.323 --> 15:59.724
<i>Okay, maybe that's</i>
<i>a little dramatic,</i>

15:59.759 --> 16:01.025
<i>but don't kid yourself:</i>

16:01.060 --> 16:02.627
<i>getting a haircut</i>
<i>is a big deal.</i>

16:02.661 --> 16:04.295
<i>Normally, I wouldn't</i>
<i>take style advice</i>

16:04.330 --> 16:05.630
<i>from helmet-haired,</i>
<i>bow-tie-loving Blaine,</i>

16:05.664 --> 16:08.400
<i>but he really helped me</i>
<i>see the light.</i>

16:08.434 --> 16:10.435
<i>Or, in this case, the scissors.</i>

16:10.469 --> 16:12.670
<i>Yeah, I'll miss rocking</i>
<i>the bronytail, but you know,</i>

16:12.705 --> 16:14.139
<i>I need to jumpstart</i>
<i>this modeling operation,</i>

16:14.173 --> 16:15.473
<i>shake things up.</i>

16:17.243 --> 16:18.476
<i>Time for new headshots,</i>

16:18.511 --> 16:19.911
<i>new portfolio,</i>

16:19.945 --> 16:22.414
<i>new attitude.</i>

16:22.448 --> 16:25.316
<i>Because if there's</i>
<i>one thing I've learned,</i>

16:25.351 --> 16:26.885
<i>you can't just sit around</i>
<i>waiting for the good things</i>

16:26.919 --> 16:28.820
<i>in life to come to you.</i>

16:28.854 --> 16:31.556
<i>You need to kick down some</i>
<i>doors and make them happen.</i>

16:31.590 --> 16:34.059
<i>This is Sam Evans</i>
<i>like we've never seen before.</i>

16:35.428 --> 16:36.861
<i>Here I come, New York City.</i>

16:36.896 --> 16:38.363
I'm so close to owning this town

16:38.397 --> 16:40.365
I can practically taste it.

16:40.399 --> 16:42.634
Yeah, that computer cost
over 1,000 bucks.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.135
My-my credit card was in there,
my phone...

16:44.170 --> 16:45.336
Tell him that
he was on crutches.

16:45.371 --> 16:46.871
And...

16:46.906 --> 16:47.872
Yeah.

16:47.907 --> 16:49.474
Thanks so much for your help.

16:49.508 --> 16:51.142
That's it? Any leads?

16:51.177 --> 16:52.377
Blaine, do you have to

16:52.411 --> 16:53.611
use the SodaStream machine
right now?

16:53.646 --> 16:56.014
Artie's in a very fragile state.

16:56.048 --> 16:58.450
I'm sorry about him.
He just needs his bubbles.

16:58.484 --> 16:59.984
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Rachel.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.920
Do you want a homemade

17:01.954 --> 17:03.154
sparkling, sugar-free soda?

17:03.189 --> 17:04.029
Oh, no thanks.

17:04.056 --> 17:05.022
The carbonation's

17:05.057 --> 17:06.357
bad for my vocal cords.

17:06.392 --> 17:07.858
But
you know what I will take?

17:07.893 --> 17:09.227
Just some, like, hot water

17:09.261 --> 17:10.361
with, like, a little lemon...

17:10.396 --> 17:11.596
Thank you so much.

17:11.630 --> 17:12.597
Rachel, you missed it.

17:12.631 --> 17:14.031
Artie was mugged in the subway,

17:14.066 --> 17:15.467
and now it's like an episode
of <i> SVU</i> over here.

17:15.501 --> 17:17.167
- What?
- Except for not at all.

17:17.203 --> 17:18.970
I wasn't touched, I was robbed.
Oh, my God.

17:19.003 --> 17:21.071
Are you okay?
No. Not really.

17:21.107 --> 17:22.807
I don't know what I'm gonna do
about replacing that computer,

17:22.842 --> 17:25.109
I need a new school ID,
and to be honest,

17:25.144 --> 17:27.011
I don't if I'm gonna feel safe
going in the subway anymore.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.481
I just felt so vulnerable
and I don't...

17:29.515 --> 17:30.648
I don't know... alone.

17:30.683 --> 17:32.717
Blaine, I'm gonna throw

17:32.752 --> 17:33.885
that machine out the window.

17:33.919 --> 17:35.186
I am so sorry,

17:35.221 --> 17:36.788
but I know exactly
how you feel, okay?

17:36.822 --> 17:38.022
When I first moved to New York,

17:38.057 --> 17:39.324
I gave this homeless
person ten dollars

17:39.358 --> 17:40.558
when I just meant
to give him one,

17:40.593 --> 17:42.060
and then when I
asked for it back,

17:42.094 --> 17:43.895
everyone hissed and
they booed at me,

17:43.929 --> 17:45.363
and I felt so violated
and vulnerable.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.499
Oh, wait.
So you were out nine dollars?

17:47.533 --> 17:49.367
But look, the next day

17:49.402 --> 17:51.069
I just got right
back on that subway,

17:51.103 --> 17:52.537
because overcoming
experiences like that

17:52.571 --> 17:54.506
is what makes you
a real New Yorker.

17:54.540 --> 17:56.241
Your beverage, milady.

17:56.275 --> 17:57.976
Oh, are those Meyer lemons?

17:58.911 --> 18:00.011
No, I can't have that.

18:00.046 --> 18:01.212
You know what, Rachel?

18:01.247 --> 18:02.714
Don't lecture me

18:02.748 --> 18:04.015
about being a real New Yorker

18:04.050 --> 18:06.184
with your lemon water
and your chauffeured limousine.

18:06.218 --> 18:08.053
You're not even a
real person anymore.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.854
Now, if you'll just excuse me,

18:09.889 --> 18:12.249
I have to go figure out how
to put my life back together.

18:13.459 --> 18:15.460
It's a town car,
not a limousine.

18:17.596 --> 18:18.463
It's a town car.

18:18.497 --> 18:19.931
Okay?

18:19.965 --> 18:22.067
A town car.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.769
So I found this song
by A Great Big World

18:24.804 --> 18:26.571
that would be perfect
for our band.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.239
It's got a nice pop feel to it

18:28.274 --> 18:29.974
without being
totally saccharine...

18:30.009 --> 18:32.043
and you're not listening
to a word I'm saying.

18:32.078 --> 18:33.211
I'm sorry.

18:33.245 --> 18:34.345
I-I didn't get
any sleep last night.

18:34.380 --> 18:35.447
Ooh, lucky you.

18:35.481 --> 18:37.382
It's not like that.

18:37.416 --> 18:40.118
<i>Blaine bought a couch</i>
<i>off the back of a truck,</i>

18:40.152 --> 18:41.586
<i>because apparently</i>
<i>the furniture</i>

18:41.620 --> 18:43.788
<i>I carefully chose</i>
<i>from Chelsea's finest</i>

18:43.823 --> 18:45.290
<i>flea markets</i>
<i>isn't that comfortable.</i>

18:45.324 --> 18:46.624
<i>It was a mid-century knockoff,</i>

18:46.659 --> 18:48.093
<i>so I gave him</i>
<i>an "A" for effort,</i>

18:48.127 --> 18:49.968
<i>but as soon as I lifted up</i>
<i>one of the cushions,</i>

18:49.995 --> 18:51.996
<i>I saw that the entire couch</i>
<i>was riddled with...</i>

18:52.031 --> 18:53.632
Bedbugs!

18:54.591 --> 18:56.911
<i>So we spent the entire night</i>
<i>disinfecting everything,</i>

18:56.936 --> 18:58.903
<i>taking Silkwood showers,</i>

18:58.938 --> 18:59.904
<i>and disinfecting</i>
<i>everything again.</i>

19:00.773 --> 19:02.273
And I know what I'm about to say

19:02.308 --> 19:03.641
sounds like a bad Bravo show,

19:03.676 --> 19:05.744
but I'm starting to
think that that couch

19:05.778 --> 19:08.480
was an omen of
our relationship.

19:08.514 --> 19:09.848
Seemingly fine from the outside,

19:09.882 --> 19:11.850
but headed for certain disaster.

19:11.884 --> 19:13.051
Hmm.
Does that sound crazy?

19:13.085 --> 19:14.285
Absolutely.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.421
Well, it's not just the couch.

19:16.455 --> 19:17.922
I'm starting to
feel claustrophobic.

19:17.957 --> 19:19.591
I mean, I wake up
next to Blaine,

19:19.625 --> 19:20.925
I-I go to school
with Blaine,

19:20.960 --> 19:22.927
I come home to Blaine.

19:22.962 --> 19:24.963
I feel like I'm starting
to lose my identity.

19:26.232 --> 19:28.152
Okay, well, stop me if
you don't want my opinion.

19:29.368 --> 19:31.603
Okay, when I first heard
you were engaged,

19:31.637 --> 19:33.805
I thought, "Hmm-mm.
Big mistake.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.140
Too young."

19:35.174 --> 19:37.108
But you know what?
Seeing you guys together,

19:37.143 --> 19:39.144
I think that what
you have is real

19:39.178 --> 19:41.312
and worth fighting for
and I'm super jealous.

19:41.347 --> 19:42.647
Still, though,

19:42.681 --> 19:43.681
everyone needs time alone.

19:43.716 --> 19:44.682
It's healthy.

19:44.717 --> 19:46.951
So just set some boundaries.

19:46.986 --> 19:48.787
But don't forget
to rehearse with your band.

I make sure they lie flat.

21:45.965 --> 21:47.432
Okay, great.
Thank you.

21:47.466 --> 21:51.703
<i>Look at me. I'm sealed up</i>
<i>in this mini Popemobile,</i>

21:51.737 --> 21:53.638

21:53.672 --> 21:55.206
<i>I feel nothing in here.</i>

21:55.241 --> 21:57.561
<i>The only air I breathe smells</i>

<i>As much as Kurt is feeling</i>

23:14.353 --> 23:16.788

23:22.862 --> 23:25.130
<i>Kurt's done a marvelous job</i>

23:25.164 --> 23:27.132
<i>of the quintessential</i>
<i>New York living experience,</i>

23:27.166 --> 23:29.667
<i>but let's be honest,</i>

23:29.702 --> 23:30.969
<i>Kurt's gonna love this.</i>

23:35.808 --> 23:38.643
Okay, is that one of those
outlines that the police use?

23:38.677 --> 23:40.245
Did somebody die in here?

23:40.279 --> 23:42.647
Sam, this in no way resembles
the shape of a person.

23:42.681 --> 23:43.848
So...?

23:43.883 --> 23:46.117
So, no, no one died in here.

23:46.152 --> 23:47.752
What did you do to your hair?!

23:47.787 --> 23:50.588
Oh, well, thanks to you,
I-I-I got it cut.

23:50.623 --> 23:51.990
And then bursting
with my newfound

23:52.024 --> 23:53.158
New York City confidence,

23:53.192 --> 23:55.426
I went out and I booked
my first modeling job!

23:55.461 --> 23:56.628
What?!
Yeah!

23:56.662 --> 23:57.796
That's amazing!
I know!

23:57.830 --> 24:00.732
Congratulations, man!
What's it for?

24:00.766 --> 24:02.500
Bubble!

24:02.535 --> 24:03.968
Okay.

24:04.003 --> 24:05.470
Booty-contouring underwear
for men.

24:05.504 --> 24:08.706
Thanks to Bubble, men can now
have that sexy,

24:08.741 --> 24:11.176
round, onion booty
that they've always dreamed of.

24:11.210 --> 24:13.478
I didn't even know
there was a market for that,

24:13.512 --> 24:15.313
but that is great.

24:15.347 --> 24:17.348
And I got you a free pair!

24:17.383 --> 24:21.219
Oh, thank you. I, um,
can't wait to show Kurt.

24:21.253 --> 24:23.721
The good news keeps
coming, my brother. I...

24:23.756 --> 24:25.824
am moving out.

24:25.858 --> 24:27.625
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.
You're-you're moving?

24:27.660 --> 24:29.660
Where you going to?
Well, the agency's

24:29.662 --> 24:31.062
putting me up in an apartment
with a bunch of other models.

24:31.096 --> 24:33.331
I'm stoked.
My own place, sort of,

24:33.365 --> 24:34.766
and you know, I'm not gonna be

24:34.800 --> 24:36.401
taking up any more room
on the couch.

24:36.435 --> 24:39.537
Well, you're gonna visit us,
right?

24:39.572 --> 24:41.739
Um, yeah, if I have time,
you know.

24:41.774 --> 24:45.410
But I-I-I might be traveling
to Paris and Milan

24:45.444 --> 24:47.612
every week. Who knows?

24:48.714 --> 24:50.048
I'm gonna pack everything up.

24:50.082 --> 24:51.549
Yeah.

24:55.321 --> 24:58.356
Hey! Oh, did you hear
Sam just got a job?

24:58.390 --> 25:00.091
What are you doing?

25:00.126 --> 25:01.366
Uh, this is, uh, something

25:01.393 --> 25:03.328
I thought would make
a really great office area.

25:03.362 --> 25:05.730
Back away from the lamp, okay?!
When someone enters

25:05.765 --> 25:08.333
their sanctuary, they don't want
their eyes immediately drawn

25:08.367 --> 25:09.601
to a hideous workspace!

25:09.635 --> 25:10.735
I'm not done yet.

25:10.770 --> 25:12.804
This isn't McKinley.
You can't just barge in here

25:12.838 --> 25:14.105
and do whatever you want,
whenever you want, all right?

25:14.140 --> 25:15.540
You could've at least
consulted me

25:15.574 --> 25:18.243
before making design decisions
in my home!

25:18.277 --> 25:20.645
I thought that this was supposed
to be <i> our</i> home, Kurt.

25:20.679 --> 25:24.616
And believe it or not, not
every single design decision

25:24.650 --> 25:26.751
you make is brilliant.
This whole privacy-

25:26.786 --> 25:29.487
curtains-between-the-bedrooms
thing is stupid. Come on.

25:29.522 --> 25:31.489
We can hear every single noise
our roomies make at night,

25:31.524 --> 25:32.724
and God knows
what they hear from us.

25:32.758 --> 25:34.259
You know what?
Elliott was right,

25:34.293 --> 25:35.560
we're losing our boundaries.

25:35.594 --> 25:37.061
I'm sorry, Elliott?
What-What does Elliot have

25:37.096 --> 25:38.263
to do with any of this?

25:38.297 --> 25:39.230
We were talking.

25:39.265 --> 25:40.532
I bet you were talking.

25:40.566 --> 25:41.432
He's my friend.

25:41.467 --> 25:42.901
I bet he's your friend.

25:42.935 --> 25:44.602
Calm down, psycho, all right?

25:44.637 --> 25:46.771
And stop being so pouty
and weird. It's annoying.

25:46.806 --> 25:49.507
All right, let's just be
adults and put everything back

25:49.542 --> 25:50.942
where it's supposed to go.

25:50.976 --> 25:53.378
Okay, I got an idea.
Why don't you put it back

25:53.412 --> 25:55.413
where it's supposed to go
because it's your apartment!

25:55.448 --> 25:57.615
Fine! I will!

26:07.760 --> 26:09.727
Hey, move it, kid!

26:23.098 --> 26:24.778
Who is it?

26:24.803 --> 26:26.737
It's Blaine.

26:26.771 --> 26:28.272
Hey, I...

26:30.742 --> 26:31.909
Are you okay?

26:31.943 --> 26:32.943
Oh...

26:32.977 --> 26:34.445
Oh, God, you're not trying

26:34.479 --> 26:35.846
to move in here, are you?

26:35.880 --> 26:38.282
No, I'm not. We need to talk.
I don't have

26:38.316 --> 26:39.917
your number and
I don't have your e-mail

26:39.951 --> 26:42.019
and we're not friend on Facebook
because I made it a point

26:42.053 --> 26:44.722
of waiting for you to friend me,
which you never did, by the way.

26:44.756 --> 26:47.057
So here I am
face-to-face.

26:47.092 --> 26:49.093
I just want to hear you
admit it.

26:49.127 --> 26:50.828
Admit what?

26:50.862 --> 26:54.565
That you're trying to steal Kurt
away from me, Starchild Gilbert!

26:54.599 --> 26:56.166
What?!
What are you talking about?

26:56.201 --> 27:00.437
Please, I was on to you
the second I saw

27:00.472 --> 27:02.512
that weird cinnamon roll selfie
you took months ago.

27:02.540 --> 27:03.941
You guys posted that.
Remember that?

27:03.975 --> 27:05.976
I get to New York
and all of a sudden

27:06.010 --> 27:09.079
it's "Elliott thinks this"
and "Elliott thinks that"

27:09.114 --> 27:11.115
and "Elliott's hair
is so full and thick

27:11.149 --> 27:13.250
that he doesn't have
to rely on hair gel."

27:13.284 --> 27:17.921
Well, I may not be a cool
steampunk, glitter-rock vampire

27:17.956 --> 27:20.457
with, like, tats and guyliner,

27:20.492 --> 27:23.427
but you know what?
I love Kurt. I love him!

27:23.461 --> 27:27.531
He's my fiancé, not
yours, so back off!

27:27.565 --> 27:30.467
Okay, are... are you done?

27:32.604 --> 27:33.971
Take this.

27:34.005 --> 27:36.407
- What? - Yeah, it's, uh,
it's like a body pillow.

27:36.441 --> 27:37.808
It think it's
gonna calm you down.

27:37.842 --> 27:39.176
Take a seat.

27:42.380 --> 27:45.082
Look, Blaine,
I'm not after Kurt.

27:45.116 --> 27:47.851
We're just friends. Don't get
me wrong, I mean, he's a,

27:47.886 --> 27:50.654
he's a cute guy, but I don't
think of him that way.

27:50.688 --> 27:54.425
And even if I did,
Kurt loves you.

27:54.459 --> 27:57.928
I mean, he-he doesn't
shut up about you, actually.

27:57.962 --> 27:59.196
Like, ever.

28:00.765 --> 28:03.367
I'm sorry. I don't know
what's going on with me.

28:03.401 --> 28:08.205
It's just, we've been apart
for so long,

28:08.239 --> 28:13.210
and now that I'm finally here,
I just want to catch up to him,

28:13.244 --> 28:14.945
I just want to make it real.

28:14.979 --> 28:16.280
And the more I try...

28:16.314 --> 28:17.481
The more it pushes him away?

28:18.683 --> 28:21.685
Well, maybe you should
stop trying.

28:23.054 --> 28:27.057
I mean, look, New York
is a really crowded place,

28:27.092 --> 28:29.572
and people need a little more
room to breathe here than usual.

28:29.594 --> 28:31.695
You're right.

28:34.032 --> 28:38.402
I guess I always think
of boundaries as walls

28:38.436 --> 28:42.106
instead of places to grow in.

28:43.575 --> 28:45.375
I'm so sorry. I-I should go.

28:45.410 --> 28:46.777
Hey, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

28:46.811 --> 28:48.212
You just got here.

28:48.246 --> 28:50.147
You want to just hang out
for a minute?

28:50.181 --> 28:51.315
Um...

28:51.349 --> 28:53.584
I mean, you've obviously
come to jam.

28:53.618 --> 28:55.052
Um... you gave me this.

28:55.086 --> 28:56.320
"Glitter-rock vampire," huh?

28:56.354 --> 28:57.514
I didn't mean that.
I'm sorry.

28:57.522 --> 29:00.357
I like that.
I-I... I can work with that.

29:00.392 --> 29:01.558
Okay, okay, all right.

29:01.593 --> 29:03.227
Come on.
Give me some blues.

29:03.261 --> 29:04.762
Give me some Southern...
Come on.

29:04.796 --> 29:06.463
Uh... um... gli...

29:23.915 --> 29:25.082
I got your text.

29:25.116 --> 29:28.519
Why did her Royal Highness
summon a commoner like me?

29:28.553 --> 29:31.121
Okay, that was a little rude,
but I know I had it coming.

29:31.156 --> 29:33.724
Look, I had an epiphany, and you
were right, okay? About everything.

29:33.758 --> 29:35.692
I don't want to be
sheltered from the world,

29:35.727 --> 29:37.661
I want to live in it.
So let's go.

29:37.695 --> 29:40.064
I have rehearsal and you have class.
Let's take the subway.

29:40.098 --> 29:41.632
No, I can't.
No, together.

29:41.666 --> 29:43.167
Look, I know that you're
a little shaken up

29:43.201 --> 29:45.369
about what happened, but trust
me, but I took Krav Maga

29:45.403 --> 29:47.483
as a child at the JCC,
and I can protect you.

29:53.144 --> 29:55.112
So what about the limo?

29:55.146 --> 29:56.513
Town car. And
I gave it up.

29:56.548 --> 29:58.649
I told my producers I'd
be in a much better place

29:58.683 --> 30:00.617
if I rode the subway
with my friend every day.

30:00.652 --> 30:02.319
Every day? Well,
if you'll have me.

30:02.353 --> 30:03.587
Look, I will make you a deal.

30:03.621 --> 30:05.322
I'll ride the subway
with you and make sure

30:05.356 --> 30:06.824
that you don't get mugged again

30:06.858 --> 30:09.526
if you give me a tongue-
lashing if I lose my way.

30:09.561 --> 30:11.061
I can do that.

30:11.096 --> 30:13.063
I'm really happy that
you're in New York.

30:13.098 --> 30:15.599
The city is a much less
scarier place with a friend.

30:15.633 --> 30:18.235
And I'm really happy you dragged
me back down here, because...

30:18.269 --> 30:19.737
I really do love it.

31:56.458 --> 31:58.335
I think there's like a dozen models
living in here,

31:58.356 --> 32:00.836
but people take off for weeks
at a time on photo shoots,

32:00.861 --> 32:02.061
so it never gets too crowded.

32:02.095 --> 32:03.229
The rooms are kind of small.

32:03.263 --> 32:04.497
Oh, that's okay;
I've been homeless.

32:04.531 --> 32:05.598
That's cool, man.

32:05.632 --> 32:06.899
I envy your realness.

32:06.933 --> 32:08.567
Listen, I got to do this
paid webcam thing in my room,

32:08.602 --> 32:09.902
but if you have any
other questions,

32:09.936 --> 32:11.070
just ask your roommate Sam.

32:11.104 --> 32:13.305
Wait, my roommate's name is Sam?

32:13.340 --> 32:14.907
Okay, this couldn't get
any cooler.

32:14.941 --> 32:16.442
- I'm sorry.
- Hi.

32:16.476 --> 32:17.877
I'm Sam.

32:19.946 --> 32:21.080
What?

32:24.951 --> 32:26.986
- Hey.
- Hi.

32:27.020 --> 32:28.954
So you went to see Elliot.

32:30.991 --> 32:33.125
I did.

32:33.159 --> 32:34.493
He's a good guy.

32:34.528 --> 32:36.295
He's a good friend to you.

32:36.329 --> 32:37.530
He's one of
the only real friends

32:37.564 --> 32:38.724
I've made since I came here.

32:40.166 --> 32:43.102
He texted me as soon
as you left his apartment.

32:43.136 --> 32:44.470
Six hours ago.

32:45.502 --> 32:47.382
So I guess
I've just been wondering

32:47.407 --> 32:48.507
where you've been.

32:49.509 --> 32:51.677
Well, I, um...

32:51.711 --> 32:54.380
I actually took a water taxi

32:54.414 --> 32:56.749
to the Statue of Liberty.

32:56.783 --> 32:58.784
Just needed some space
so I could think.

32:58.818 --> 33:01.787
I went to the High Line
to do the same.

33:03.156 --> 33:05.024
Well, then can I go first?

33:19.606 --> 33:21.874
I think I should move out.

33:21.908 --> 33:24.176
I'm not sure that's what I want.

33:24.211 --> 33:26.512
Me neither, but I think...

33:26.546 --> 33:28.547
we need to take a step back

33:28.582 --> 33:32.017
for a second together and...

33:32.052 --> 33:35.888
just look at the situation

33:35.922 --> 33:39.491
honestly.

33:39.526 --> 33:41.527
It's not working out.

33:43.763 --> 33:46.065
After graduation, I just...

33:46.099 --> 33:48.267
moved in and we didn't have
a conversation about it.

33:48.301 --> 33:50.336
We never weighed
the pros and cons.

33:50.370 --> 33:52.705
We never really discussed

33:52.739 --> 33:56.075
if this was
the absolute best thing

33:56.109 --> 33:57.943
for our relationship.

33:57.978 --> 34:00.079
We just wanted to be us.
Together.

34:00.113 --> 34:01.914
And-and we are together.

34:01.948 --> 34:03.082
We are so together,

34:03.116 --> 34:06.385
but I just think that maybe...

34:06.419 --> 34:08.020
living together

34:08.054 --> 34:11.489
in less
than ideal circumstances...

34:11.525 --> 34:13.359
Maybe we don't need
that pressure right now.

34:13.393 --> 34:16.094
I mean, it's such
a scary decision to make.

34:16.129 --> 34:17.862
I-I just, I feel like I-I...

34:17.898 --> 34:19.031
I know, I know.

34:19.065 --> 34:20.331
It is scary,

34:20.367 --> 34:23.068
but I think it's
a little less scary if...

34:23.103 --> 34:25.004
we make the decision together.

34:25.038 --> 34:26.405
We can't go backwards.

34:26.438 --> 34:28.440
We're not going backwards.

34:28.475 --> 34:30.775
I think we're...

34:30.810 --> 34:32.378
being smart.

34:32.411 --> 34:37.049
By protecting something
that is very precious to me.

34:38.051 --> 34:40.018
You know that, right?

34:40.053 --> 34:42.353
Of course I know that.
Of course.

34:42.389 --> 34:44.389
Always. I know.

34:49.262 --> 34:51.163
And no matter who we become,

34:51.197 --> 34:53.098
even if we do need alone time...

34:53.132 --> 34:54.800
which is completely valid...

34:54.835 --> 34:56.715
we'll always belong
to each other.

35:06.150 --> 35:08.190
And even though
this-this wasn't a fight,

35:08.215 --> 35:11.183
this was just, you know,
a grown-up, adult conversation...

35:11.218 --> 35:14.453
you know, we are now

35:14.487 --> 35:16.555
going to have
the hottest makeup sex ever.

35:16.590 --> 35:18.424
Okay.

35:18.458 --> 35:21.527
It never hurts
to sing when you're going on a casting.

35:21.561 --> 35:23.762
You do the best impressions!

35:23.797 --> 35:25.297
That's so Kathy Ireland.

35:25.332 --> 35:26.632
Huh.

35:26.666 --> 35:28.167
Okay, now do Gisele.

35:28.201 --> 35:30.336
No, I should probably, uh... I
should probably get some sleep.

35:30.370 --> 35:32.505
I-I got a big follow-up photo
shoot with, uh, Bubble tomorrow.

35:32.539 --> 35:34.440
The wonderbutt undies?

35:34.474 --> 35:35.741
Oh, my God, Sam!

35:35.775 --> 35:37.443
Congratulations. That's great.

35:37.477 --> 35:39.078
- Thanks.
- Okay, well, look,

35:39.112 --> 35:40.346
use these.

35:40.380 --> 35:41.747
I swear by it.

35:41.781 --> 35:43.682
It keeps your body
from retaining <i> any</i> water.

35:43.717 --> 35:45.985
I have Adderall if you want.

35:46.019 --> 35:48.454
Oh, if you have trouble
sleeping, Marla has Ambien.

35:48.488 --> 35:50.322
I prefer Lunesta.

35:50.357 --> 35:52.091
My schedule's been
so cray lately.

35:52.125 --> 35:54.260
But don't take
whatever Gavin has.

35:54.294 --> 35:56.262
He says it's clenbuterol,

35:56.296 --> 35:58.430
but I swear
it's like pig tranquilizers.

35:58.465 --> 36:00.199
Sorry. I got to go.

36:01.635 --> 36:03.369
You don't have anything
for anxiety, do you?

36:03.403 --> 36:06.372
I don't, uh... don't think
I can stay here.

36:06.406 --> 36:08.140
I hate everything.

36:08.174 --> 36:09.775
Sam?

36:11.077 --> 36:12.611
Oh, my God, you guys

36:12.646 --> 36:14.947
are not gonna believe what
happened to me and Artie today.

36:14.981 --> 36:16.515
- Sam? - Sam, come here.
Listen to this.

36:16.550 --> 36:17.710
I know this is going to sound

36:17.717 --> 36:18.951
like one of those crazy
New York stories,

36:18.985 --> 36:20.219
and I wouldn't believe it myself

36:20.253 --> 36:21.820
if it hadn't just happened,
but I swear...

36:21.855 --> 36:23.489
- Just tell us.
- Okay, right.

36:23.523 --> 36:24.690
So, Rachel and I
were riding the L-Train.

36:24.724 --> 36:26.992
Take a little nap right now.

36:27.027 --> 36:28.928
- Oh, my God, it's him.
- Who?

36:28.962 --> 36:30.162
The guy who mugged me.

36:30.197 --> 36:31.463
Oh, no.

36:31.498 --> 36:32.898
Yeah.

36:32.933 --> 36:33.866
Shut up.

36:33.900 --> 36:35.234
Okay, so then, we see this guy,

36:35.268 --> 36:36.569
and he's, like, inching
towards this super sweet,

36:36.603 --> 36:37.903
elegant, elderly-looking
lady, who'd obviously,

36:37.938 --> 36:39.238
like, had a little
bit of work done,

36:39.272 --> 36:41.240
but it was very tasteful. Just,
like, right around her eyes.

36:41.274 --> 36:43.242
And this guy was eyeing
her gorgeous Hermès Birkin bag.

36:43.276 --> 36:44.310
And then...

36:44.344 --> 36:46.011
- It's pepper spray.
- Let me do it.

36:46.046 --> 36:48.047
Go! Be careful.

36:51.401 --> 36:53.562
I cut him off and sprayed him
right in the eye.

36:53.587 --> 36:55.421
God, I felt so vindicated.

36:55.455 --> 36:56.422
It was amazing.

36:56.456 --> 36:57.723
And when we got off the subway,

36:57.757 --> 36:59.358
we found out that this
guy got arrested, and

36:59.392 --> 37:00.912
it turns out that
he's, like, a mugger,

37:00.927 --> 37:03.195
slash, hoarder, so all this
stuff was just at his apartment.

37:03.230 --> 37:04.763
Yeah, and the cops
found my laptop!

37:04.798 --> 37:05.998
- It's amazing.
- Great.

37:06.032 --> 37:07.199
You're like a real
life Professor X.

37:07.234 --> 37:08.767
Yeah.
It's so great.

37:08.802 --> 37:09.501
That was pretty amazing.

37:09.536 --> 37:10.769
Well, Kurt and I

37:10.804 --> 37:12.371
have had a bit of a big day
ourselves, actually.

37:12.405 --> 37:13.973
Well, it wasn't
as dramatic as that.

37:14.007 --> 37:16.108
Well, it-it was...
it was pretty dramatic.

37:16.142 --> 37:18.777
Um, we decided
that I'm going to move out.

37:18.812 --> 37:20.045
- Shut up!
- Really?

37:20.080 --> 37:21.213
Don't worry.
We're not breaking up.

37:21.248 --> 37:22.548
Oh, no, no, no, far from it.

37:22.582 --> 37:23.883
We actually think this is gonna
strengthen our relationship.

37:23.917 --> 37:25.217
Yeah, I said
he needs to discover the city

37:25.252 --> 37:26.385
the same way I got to.

37:26.419 --> 37:27.553
You know,
find his favorite neighborhood,

37:27.587 --> 37:28.721
find his favorite pizza place.

37:28.755 --> 37:30.556
You know, have
some time and space

37:30.590 --> 37:32.758
to explore and grow
and find out who he is here.

37:32.792 --> 37:34.193
And to that
end, my first thought

37:34.227 --> 37:36.495
is that I'm a guy
that wouldn't mind crashing

37:36.530 --> 37:38.397
on Sam's couch
in his new apartment.

37:38.431 --> 37:41.667
I actually... I actually don't
have a new apartment anymore.

37:41.701 --> 37:43.135
Um, I moved out.

37:43.169 --> 37:45.738
That place... it
wasn't it for me.

37:45.772 --> 37:48.252
I'm not saying I'm giving up
my dream of being a model.

37:48.275 --> 37:49.074
I still want that

37:49.109 --> 37:50.242
more than ever.

37:50.277 --> 37:51.644
I just... I want to
do it the right way

37:51.678 --> 37:53.879
with, you know, no puking,
pills and eating cotton balls.

37:53.914 --> 37:54.947
Well, that's good.

37:54.981 --> 37:56.582
Maybe we can find
a place together.

37:56.616 --> 37:57.449
- Yes.
- Yeah.

37:57.484 --> 37:59.051
- Up top?
- Yeah.

37:59.085 --> 38:01.387
Guess who's taking over New York?

38:01.421 --> 38:03.889
- What?! - I mean, this day
couldn't get any better.

38:03.924 --> 38:05.090
It could not get any better.

38:05.125 --> 38:06.892
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, I missed you guys.

38:06.927 --> 38:09.407
Okay, that's it.
You're never leaving now.

38:11.376 --> 38:14.433
Just ring it a little bit
to the right. Oh, my gosh, this

38:14.468 --> 38:16.948
apartment is so cute. I'm so
happy that Mercedes is here.

38:16.970 --> 38:18.104
Well, technically,
she's not here,

38:18.138 --> 38:19.472
which is why
we're doing all the work.

38:19.506 --> 38:20.773
And where is she?

38:20.807 --> 38:21.807
She's inside

38:21.842 --> 38:23.843
with Sam... alone.

38:23.877 --> 38:24.777
Oh, dear God.

38:24.811 --> 38:26.712
I mean, you know, L.A.'s okay

38:26.747 --> 38:29.148
if you like sunshine
all the time, which I don't.

38:29.182 --> 38:30.850
- Yeah.
- It makes me squint.

38:30.884 --> 38:32.985
Then I got to thinking
about all of you guys

38:33.019 --> 38:34.987
and all the fun that
you must be having.

38:35.021 --> 38:37.189
And I ain't ashamed to say it.

38:37.224 --> 38:38.891
Got a little lonely out there.

38:38.925 --> 38:41.327
I missed you.
Well, I miss everyone.

38:41.361 --> 38:44.196
- Even Rachel?
- Yes, even Rachel.

38:44.231 --> 38:46.599
That girl...
she keeps my head in the game.

38:46.633 --> 38:48.467
So I told the producers
that my album

38:48.502 --> 38:51.470
needed an East Coast, Harlem,
bebop, uptown kind of vibe.

38:52.806 --> 38:55.307
You know, I don't have any idea
what that means, but

38:55.342 --> 38:56.408
the suckers bought it.

38:56.443 --> 38:57.510
I love the Harlem bebop.

38:57.544 --> 38:59.011
So here I am.

38:59.045 --> 39:01.647
Two bedrooms and a refrigerator.

39:01.681 --> 39:03.749
That's so cool.
It's crazy.

39:03.784 --> 39:04.944
So, uh, what are you gonna...

39:04.951 --> 39:06.218
what are you gonna do
with the other room?

39:06.253 --> 39:08.254
Oh, well, you know,
I was thinking

39:08.288 --> 39:09.822
of storing my hair
for my weaves in there.

39:09.856 --> 39:11.657
But then I got to thinking,

39:11.691 --> 39:12.931
maybe I should rent it out

39:12.959 --> 39:14.226
to a couple of nerds I
knew back in high school.

39:14.261 --> 39:16.295
You know, but Blaine
and I need a place,

39:16.329 --> 39:19.365
so, you could just,
you know, rent to us.

39:19.399 --> 39:22.535
Oh, you were talking about us.
Yes, I was.

39:22.569 --> 39:24.703
Well, listen, that's great. That's amazing.
I heard that. Yeah.

39:24.738 --> 39:26.005
Yeah. Ah.

39:26.039 --> 39:27.406
Uh, what are we, uh...?

39:27.441 --> 39:29.475
But what are we gonna do about
the... our sexual chemistry?

39:29.509 --> 39:31.043
'Cause it's...

39:31.077 --> 39:33.946
Uh-uh. No. Been there,
done that. No, Sam.

39:33.980 --> 39:35.347
Okay, yeah, just friends,
just friends.

39:35.382 --> 39:36.782
Yeah. This looks
good, though.

39:36.817 --> 39:38.217
All right, fine.
Yeah, just friends.

39:38.218 --> 39:40.419
- That's a good call. That's
a good call. - Mm-hmm.

39:40.454 --> 39:42.455
Just, uh...

39:42.489 --> 39:44.256
I will bite your wax lips off.

39:44.291 --> 39:48.094
Listen, we play by my
rules, or not at all.

39:48.128 --> 39:49.295
Okay?

39:49.329 --> 39:50.463
Oh, yeah.

39:50.497 --> 39:52.364
Can you tighten that up?

39:52.399 --> 39:54.033
It's a little loose.

39:54.067 --> 39:59.238
Some people just don't
know how to screw things.

39:59.272 --> 40:00.606
Come on.

40:00.640 --> 40:02.280
I really wish
I could be helping you guys.

40:02.309 --> 40:04.076
Oh, don't worry about it,
Artie. We know you would help.

40:04.111 --> 40:05.811
Rachel, on the other
hand... I don't know.

40:05.846 --> 40:07.880
What? I'm texting
my publicist.

40:07.914 --> 40:11.083
That was a
joke, but I do have to go!

40:11.118 --> 40:13.419
We're doing sound and mic
checks now at the theatre.

40:13.453 --> 40:15.054
Are we still on
for dinner tonight

40:15.088 --> 40:16.248
for our annual Monday night

40:16.256 --> 40:17.490
because-it's-my-only-night-off
dinner?

40:17.524 --> 40:19.164
Let's do a potluck,
'cause I'm not cooking

40:19.192 --> 40:20.592
- for everybody.
- Okay. I'm so excited.

40:20.594 --> 40:22.234
This is going to be
a great new tradition!

40:22.262 --> 40:23.896
I'm gonna go and get pies
now for everyone.

40:23.930 --> 40:24.897
Taxi!

40:24.931 --> 40:28.167
Taxi! Hey!

40:28.201 --> 40:29.168
God, I love her style.

40:29.202 --> 40:31.137
God, I need a break.
