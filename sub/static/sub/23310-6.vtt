WEBVTT

00:04.674 --> 00:05.841
How do you have a Tesla?

00:05.841 --> 00:08.049
It's my friend-woman's.

00:08.257 --> 00:09.633
You mean girlfriend?

00:10.591 --> 00:12.507
Does this person have a name?

00:13.758 --> 00:16.549
I'm her therapist.
I have to break up with her.

00:16.549 --> 00:17.466
She has a daughter

00:17.674 --> 00:19.549
who's approximately
the same age as Tom.

00:19.549 --> 00:21.591
-Somewhere more fun than this.

00:22.674 --> 00:24.132
Look, I could be with Andrew.

00:24.132 --> 00:26.049
But it's just not what
I'm looking for right now.

00:26.049 --> 00:28.174
DIANE: Are you sure?
He's so cute.

00:28.965 --> 00:31.341
If you could paint a few more?
We have a show.

00:31.341 --> 00:33.299
There's no way I could do
more paintings.

00:33.299 --> 00:34.174
I'll give you a month.

00:34.758 --> 00:37.174
Thank you for the invite.
It was very big of you.

00:37.174 --> 00:39.049
FRANCES DUFRESNE:
If he's happy, I'm happy.

00:39.049 --> 00:40.674
JACKIE: I probably
should be thanking you.

00:40.674 --> 00:42.132
-For divorcing him.

00:56.299 --> 00:57.633
Both: Oh!

00:59.965 --> 01:04.799
That's all right,
it's not gonna take that long
to pick up 7,000 pennies.

01:04.799 --> 01:06.341
Is that 7,000 pennies?

01:06.341 --> 01:08.466
Well, I'm rounding up,
but it's a lot of pennies.

01:08.466 --> 01:10.799
- I'm sorry.

01:14.090 --> 01:17.466
Do you think
Mom would let me
dye my hair purple?

01:17.466 --> 01:20.799
No. And God
bless her for that.

01:20.799 --> 01:22.633
All right,
give me five minutes.

01:22.633 --> 01:25.716
I'm gonna rustle up
some cheese and crackers
for you, okay?

01:25.716 --> 01:28.257
- Okay.

01:32.007 --> 01:34.965
Hey.
Hey, who's in there?

01:34.965 --> 01:36.466
Hey, Dad.

01:36.466 --> 01:38.257
Dude, I thought
you were a vagrant.

01:38.257 --> 01:40.341
What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be
at Matthew's.

01:40.341 --> 01:42.007
He's sick.
He has a stomach bug.

01:42.007 --> 01:44.257
Oh.
Ugh, what a drag.

01:44.257 --> 01:46.090
Let me jump in real quick,
'cause I gotta pee.

01:46.090 --> 01:48.007
Yeah, I'm right about
to hop in the shower.

01:48.007 --> 01:49.591
- I have one bathroom.

01:49.591 --> 01:51.007
I have to pee.
Let me--

01:51.007 --> 01:52.965
Shit.

01:52.965 --> 01:55.799
- Oh, hi, Robert.
- Ah! Shit!

01:55.799 --> 01:58.174
What the actual fuck, man?

02:05.007 --> 02:07.841
Okay, uh, Ella,
could you get some
more clothing on, please?

02:07.841 --> 02:09.883
Tom, get your ass
out of that bathroom.

02:09.883 --> 02:12.007
Oh, shit.

02:12.007 --> 02:13.841
Lila "Crocodile-a," honey,

02:13.841 --> 02:16.716
I need to have
a grown-up conversation
with Tom, all right?

02:16.716 --> 02:19.341
- Stop calling me that.
- I-- I promise.

02:19.341 --> 02:22.965
- Dude, just to reiterate,
man, what the fuck?

02:22.965 --> 02:25.215
Dad, it's really not
that big of a deal.

02:25.215 --> 02:26.965
It's sex, okay?

02:26.965 --> 02:29.633
We've had a lot
of conversations about this.

02:29.633 --> 02:31.507
But, I mean,
the-- the first time

02:31.507 --> 02:33.549
on the bathroom floor
of your father's apartment,

02:33.549 --> 02:36.799
that-- that's not a place
for it to go down,
so to speak.

02:36.799 --> 02:39.883
It's not the first time.
We've done it before.

02:39.883 --> 02:43.049
Okay, there's so many things
that I want to talk about
right now.

02:43.049 --> 02:46.257
I'm gonna skip over
the first four and go
to number five.

02:46.257 --> 02:48.215
- Dad!

02:48.215 --> 02:51.174
Bye, Tom.
See you at my mom's,
Robert.

02:51.174 --> 02:52.549
- 'Kay.
- Bye.

02:52.549 --> 02:54.299
Say hi to your mom.

02:56.257 --> 02:57.382
Fuck!

02:57.382 --> 02:58.799
Of all the girls
in the world,

02:58.799 --> 03:00.883
you gotta pick
my girlfriend's daughter?

03:00.883 --> 03:02.591
I don't know,
she likes me.

03:04.007 --> 03:06.883
This is a real
shitbasket, Tom.

03:06.883 --> 03:09.174
A real shitbasket.

03:09.174 --> 03:10.758
Oh, no, no, no,
please don't clean up.

03:10.758 --> 03:11.965
Please, let me do it.
Let me do it.

03:11.965 --> 03:13.257
- Yeah.

03:13.257 --> 03:15.382
- Oh, thank God.

03:15.382 --> 03:18.591
Well, I'm sorry
to, uh, leave you

03:18.591 --> 03:21.382
amidst this
financial crisis.

03:23.507 --> 03:25.758
I'm meeting Sylvia,
to hang her show tonight.

03:25.758 --> 03:28.257
Excellent.
Well, maybe I'll
just see you tomorrow.

03:28.257 --> 03:30.924
Oh, uh...

03:30.924 --> 03:33.007
I don't-- I don't
think I can tomorrow.

03:33.007 --> 03:34.382
That's all right.
No worries.

03:34.382 --> 03:35.924
I got a late-night dinner
with clients.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.007
You're just
making me stay late

03:37.007 --> 03:38.466
to do bad karaoke after.

03:38.466 --> 03:40.633
What's your song?

03:40.633 --> 03:43.382
- "Bohemian Rhapsody,"
of course.
- Bold.

03:43.382 --> 03:46.549
- "Seasons in the Sun."

03:46.549 --> 03:47.965
Every single time.

03:47.965 --> 03:49.507
Isn't it about
a dying guy?

03:49.507 --> 03:52.007
Well, yes,
but you know what?

03:52.007 --> 03:55.965
The chorus
is surprisingly uplifting.

03:55.965 --> 03:57.674
Robert:
When we got
to the apartment,

03:57.674 --> 03:59.841
they weren't
actually having sex,

03:59.841 --> 04:03.215
but apparently
that ship has sailed.

04:03.215 --> 04:04.299
That's it?

04:04.299 --> 04:06.466
Oh, my God,
you made me so nervous.

04:06.466 --> 04:08.174
I thought something
was actually wrong.

04:08.174 --> 04:09.132
Mild or spicy?

04:09.132 --> 04:11.132
- Oh, spicy.
- Robert: Mild.

04:11.132 --> 04:14.090
Spicy.
Uh, that's fine,
thank you.

04:14.090 --> 04:18.924
Maybe you're not clear
on the whole "sex boat
leaving the harbor" thing.

04:18.924 --> 04:22.424
- I mean, your daughter
and my son are having--
- Man: Here you go.

04:22.424 --> 04:24.633
Thank you.

04:24.633 --> 04:26.466
- Man: You're welcome.
- Sexual relations.

04:26.466 --> 04:28.674
They're teenagers.
That's what teenagers do.

04:28.674 --> 04:30.549
And Tom is so cute.

04:30.549 --> 04:32.965
You're not
reacting at all

04:32.965 --> 04:34.382
like I thought
you would react.

04:34.382 --> 04:38.174
I mean, you were
more concerned about
"the mole."

04:38.174 --> 04:40.507
Jackie:
What do you
want me to do?

04:40.507 --> 04:43.341
Mostly, I am just glad
that Ella is dating nice guys

04:43.341 --> 04:45.633
and not those shits
she was dating back
in the city.

04:45.633 --> 04:47.341
Tom is a good kid.

04:47.341 --> 04:48.965
Well, thank you.
Yeah, he is.

04:48.965 --> 04:51.341
And I've always
encouraged Ella
to be her true self.

04:51.341 --> 04:53.507
It just turns out
that her true self

04:53.507 --> 04:55.633
is kind of sexual.

04:55.633 --> 04:57.841
Oh, thank you so much.

04:57.841 --> 04:59.341
And if she's gonna
have sex,

04:59.341 --> 05:01.716
I told her it shouldn't be
all hand jobs and blow jobs.

05:01.716 --> 05:03.549
It should be enjoyable
for her as well.

05:03.549 --> 05:05.883
It should help her
figure out the totality
of who she is.

05:05.883 --> 05:08.965
You said "hand jobs"
and "blow jobs" to
your daughter?

05:08.965 --> 05:12.257
- Yeah.
- That's a very
progressive perspective.

05:12.257 --> 05:14.549
Would you rather
Tom kept his private life
from you?

05:14.549 --> 05:17.883
- Yes.
- Look, Ella's
had sex before.

05:17.883 --> 05:19.591
She's gonna
have sex again.

05:19.591 --> 05:22.215
And I'm just glad
she can come to me
if anything goes wrong.

05:22.215 --> 05:23.924
Tom is gonna be
just fine.

05:25.132 --> 05:27.466
Okay, cool.

05:27.466 --> 05:29.341
Cool.

05:29.341 --> 05:31.215
Cool.

- I hate hairy teeth.
- Ugh, I know.

06:14.591 --> 06:18.466
It's like, uh--
it's like your teeth
are wearing sweaters.

06:18.466 --> 06:20.549
- No, sorry.

06:20.549 --> 06:22.215
Mm, here.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.466
Nothing here.

06:24.466 --> 06:26.132
Well...

06:26.132 --> 06:27.341
Ah, yes.

06:28.466 --> 06:29.799
Hair of the dog.

06:32.633 --> 06:35.007
Good morning, ladies.

06:35.007 --> 06:36.507
- Good morning.

06:36.507 --> 06:38.257
I got you
an iced coffee, Frances.

06:38.257 --> 06:39.674
Sylvia, I would've
gotten one for you,

06:39.674 --> 06:41.299
but I didn't know that
you were gonna be here.

06:41.299 --> 06:43.633
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

06:43.633 --> 06:46.132
Mm, interesting--
pizza and coffee.

06:46.132 --> 06:48.674
Frances,
guess who I saw

06:48.674 --> 06:50.633
at my aerial Pilates class
this morning.

06:50.633 --> 06:53.799
- Um...
- Penny Loafer Susan.

06:53.799 --> 06:56.799
- Oh!
- Ooh, floor time fun.

06:56.799 --> 06:59.341
- Oh, of course.

06:59.341 --> 07:01.215
Wait, weren't you
wearing that yesterday?

07:01.215 --> 07:03.799
Are you on
a walk of shame?

07:03.799 --> 07:05.174
No.

07:05.174 --> 07:07.049
No, not at all, no.

07:07.049 --> 07:08.633
We were here
all night working.

07:08.633 --> 07:11.841
Yeah.
Look, it's all hung.

07:11.841 --> 07:13.633
Wow.
Really, all night?

07:13.633 --> 07:15.007
- Yeah, but--
- Wow.

07:15.007 --> 07:17.049
It wasn't so bad,
was it?

07:19.299 --> 07:22.341
Now it all
looks wonderful,
that's for sure.

07:22.341 --> 07:24.883
But I can't believe
you were here working
all night long.

07:24.883 --> 07:28.257
- My goodness.
- Well, we did take
a little pizza break.

07:28.257 --> 07:30.924
And had a heated debate
about space aliens.

07:30.924 --> 07:33.215
Oh, my God,
don't ask.

07:33.215 --> 07:36.382
And then we figured,
"Oh, you know, we're up.

07:36.382 --> 07:39.424
Might as well stay
and watch the sun rise."

07:39.424 --> 07:42.633
Oh. Wow,
look at you two.

07:42.633 --> 07:45.007
Like a cute
little indie movie,
the two of you.

07:45.007 --> 07:47.049
Hey, Frances,
how's Andrew doing?

07:47.049 --> 07:49.883
Hmm? Not to toot
my own horn, Sylvia,

07:49.883 --> 07:51.716
but I don't know
if you know that
I was the one

07:51.716 --> 07:54.215
who set Frances up
with her boyfriend.

07:54.215 --> 07:55.215
Toot-toot.

07:55.215 --> 07:56.883
I thought
you just got divorced.

07:56.883 --> 07:58.049
You have
a boyfriend already?

07:58.049 --> 07:59.424
No.
No, no, no.

07:59.424 --> 08:01.007
He's not a boyfriend.
Not a boyfriend.

08:01.007 --> 08:02.382
He's a nice guy,
but, honestly,

08:02.382 --> 08:04.883
things are more serious
with my mailman.

08:04.883 --> 08:09.007
No, we're just--
uh, we're casual.

08:09.007 --> 08:10.424
You know?
It's fun.

08:10.424 --> 08:12.841
So, is it like the fun
you had with Julian?

08:12.841 --> 08:15.424
Well, having fun
with one person

08:15.424 --> 08:17.716
while you're still married
to another person,

08:17.716 --> 08:20.799
it turns out...
that's not fun.

08:20.799 --> 08:24.174
You had an affair?
That's kind of fucked up.

08:24.174 --> 08:27.090
Excuse me, Frances is not
"kind of fucked up."

08:27.090 --> 08:29.591
She was involved
in an intricate situation

08:29.591 --> 08:31.716
where her emotional needs
were simply not being met.

08:31.716 --> 08:33.841
- Plain and simple.
Well...

08:33.841 --> 08:36.591
I don't know
if it's plain and simple,
but that's a version.

08:36.591 --> 08:37.758
Put it this way.

08:37.758 --> 08:39.674
Frances's divorce
was a difficult time

08:39.674 --> 08:41.007
for all of us.

08:41.007 --> 08:43.382
And look at her,
she is just thriving now.

08:43.382 --> 08:45.382
No, fucked up is good.

08:45.382 --> 08:47.799
- Like, it's interesting.
- Oh.

08:47.799 --> 08:50.924
You got more layers to you
than I thought, Frances.

08:50.924 --> 08:53.215
How many layers
did you think I had?

08:53.215 --> 08:55.424
Two, Three.

08:55.424 --> 09:00.633
Well, in that case,
my many newly revealed
layers thank you.

09:02.174 --> 09:05.883
- Frances: Here you go.
- Ah, thanks for this.

09:05.883 --> 09:07.549
When I pulled mine
out of storage,

09:07.549 --> 09:09.758
something had chewed
through all the strings,

09:09.758 --> 09:11.965
which was
rather unsettling.

09:11.965 --> 09:13.466
Well, you're welcome
to mine.

09:13.466 --> 09:15.215
I haven't played since
before Lila was born.

09:15.215 --> 09:16.883
God, how did I let
Diane talk me into

09:16.883 --> 09:18.674
this tennis clinic anyway?

09:18.674 --> 09:20.965
- You know I'm not
a group person.
- Oh, I know.

09:20.965 --> 09:23.674
I remember vividly
your one week in book club.

09:23.674 --> 09:25.924
Say what you want,
but I was right about
"The Grapes of Wrath."

09:25.924 --> 09:30.007
Yes, it's depressing,
but it is in fact about
the Great Depression.

09:30.007 --> 09:32.466
- I don't think Steinbeck
was really interested

09:32.466 --> 09:33.466
in lightening the mood.

09:33.466 --> 09:35.049
Lila, come on,
honey, hurry up.

09:35.049 --> 09:37.215
Maria's mom's
gonna be here any second.

09:37.215 --> 09:39.965
- Good-bye.
- Be nice!

09:39.965 --> 09:43.007
- I'll try.

09:43.007 --> 09:46.299
- Can I dye my hair
purple, please?

09:46.299 --> 09:47.591
Yeah, definitely not.

09:47.591 --> 09:49.299
Dad said I could.

09:52.466 --> 09:53.965
Well, he told me
to ask you.

09:53.965 --> 09:56.424
Oh, okay, then.
No.

09:56.424 --> 09:59.674
So, I am not allowed
to dye my hair,

09:59.674 --> 10:02.674
but Tom can have sex
with Ella in Dad's bathroom?

10:02.674 --> 10:03.716
Okay.

10:03.716 --> 10:06.549
Wait, I'm--
I'm s

10:06.549 --> 10:09.007
Wait, what?
W

10:09.007 --> 10:11.007
- Frances: So,
thank you once again...

10:11.007 --> 10:13.841
...for fitting us in
on such short notice.

10:13.841 --> 10:17.466
Today, we are not here
to discuss marital issues,

10:17.466 --> 10:19.758
but we're here to talk about
my girlfriend's daughter.

10:19.758 --> 10:23.007
Wait, so you're having
an affair now?

10:23.007 --> 10:25.674
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
No, we-- we got divorced.

10:25.674 --> 10:27.799
Yup. Miss a little,
miss a lot.

10:27.799 --> 10:29.674
He shaved his mustache.

10:29.674 --> 10:31.924
You probably
noticed that because...

10:31.924 --> 10:34.215
you're a professional
observer.

10:34.215 --> 10:37.965
A few months ago,
this could've easily
turned into a 12-rounder,

10:37.965 --> 10:41.132
but now, you know,
we just say to each other,

10:41.132 --> 10:43.549
"Hey, let's go see
a third party

10:43.549 --> 10:45.090
and just wade through

10:45.090 --> 10:47.090
this puddle of vomit."

10:47.090 --> 10:49.883
Well, that's kind of
a unnecessary vivid image,

10:49.883 --> 10:55.007
but, yes, yes, we want
to wade through this
separately, together.

10:55.007 --> 10:59.049
Because we've comfortably
fallen into this pattern

10:59.049 --> 11:02.549
of you take care
of your side of the street,
I'll take care of mine.

11:02.549 --> 11:05.799
Right, but then there's
this dangerous intersection

11:05.799 --> 11:09.674
where these
head-on collisions happen.

11:09.674 --> 11:11.090
Fender benders.

11:11.090 --> 11:12.841
So, the issue is...

11:12.841 --> 11:16.507
our 16-year-old son, Tom,

11:16.507 --> 11:22.257
who has recently become
sexually active

11:22.257 --> 11:24.924
with Robert's
girlfriend's daughter.

11:24.924 --> 11:27.257
In his house,
under his roof,

11:27.257 --> 11:29.965
in his bathroom,
on his watch.

11:29.965 --> 11:31.883
- Sounds worse than it is.
- Not really.

11:31.883 --> 11:34.758
Okay, look, admittedly,
it's a lot to chew on,

11:34.758 --> 11:37.049
but I'm completely
sensitive to the fact

11:37.049 --> 11:38.549
that it might be harder
for Frances

11:38.549 --> 11:40.841
to embrace the fact
that our son Tom

11:40.841 --> 11:42.341
is having sex
for the first time,

11:42.341 --> 11:46.674
given her
traditional, uh, sense

11:46.674 --> 11:49.257
of human sexuality.

11:49.257 --> 11:51.007
I'm sorry?

11:51.007 --> 11:52.883
Well,
when we were married,

11:52.883 --> 11:55.174
8 out of every 10 times
we had sex,

11:55.174 --> 11:58.799
I was the--
the, you know, initiator.

11:58.799 --> 12:03.215
That is complete
and utter bullshit.

12:03.215 --> 12:05.633
Complete
and utter bullshit.

12:05.633 --> 12:08.215
He is basing this
on one incident

12:08.215 --> 12:10.466
where you woke me up
at 3:00 in the morning

12:10.466 --> 12:12.591
when I had influenza.

12:12.591 --> 12:14.799
- Fever broken, on the mend.

12:14.799 --> 12:17.799
I don't know
how this is helping us.

12:17.799 --> 12:21.466
The point is
Robert's judgment,
or lack of judgment--

12:21.466 --> 12:24.633
see, I don't know what
is going on in your house
when Jackie's there.

12:24.633 --> 12:28.507
I don't know
what Tom is accidentally
seeing or hearing.

12:28.507 --> 12:30.466
Yeah, it's a regular
sex den over there.

12:30.466 --> 12:33.215
- It's just wall-to-wall sex.
- Okay, okay, okay.

12:33.215 --> 12:34.965
I'm just--
all I'm saying

12:34.965 --> 12:38.841
is just maybe
a little discretion,
that's all,

12:38.841 --> 12:40.758
when the kids
are around.

12:40.758 --> 12:44.132
In my estimation,
there has been
no indiscretion.

12:44.132 --> 12:46.007
- Anyway, moving forward.

12:46.007 --> 12:49.257
I think that
we need to implement

12:49.257 --> 12:53.549
some basic,
simple ground rules

12:53.549 --> 12:55.466
and agree to establish

12:55.466 --> 12:58.132
the environments
of our home are the same.

12:58.132 --> 12:59.549
I agree.

12:59.549 --> 13:01.633
Oh, okay, good.

13:01.633 --> 13:06.591
Okay, so Tom's door
stays open

13:06.591 --> 13:08.341
when Ella is over.

13:08.341 --> 13:11.007
And she can
only come over

13:11.007 --> 13:13.799
if there is an adult
in the house.

13:13.799 --> 13:14.758
Done.

13:14.758 --> 13:16.424
- Great.
- Great.

13:16.424 --> 13:19.633
So, this was
a complete waste
of time and money.

13:19.633 --> 13:23.382
So, you want a ride
back to Hastings?
I drove in.

13:23.382 --> 13:25.965
I wanted
to be the master
of my own destiny

13:25.965 --> 13:28.507
and not be at the mercy
of all the commuters

13:28.507 --> 13:31.466
with their-- their khakis
and their pocket beers.

13:31.466 --> 13:33.299
Uh, yeah, no, thanks.

13:33.299 --> 13:35.758
I'm just gonna stay in,
'cause I gotta get stuff
for the gallery.

13:35.758 --> 13:37.341
Okay.

13:37.341 --> 13:38.507
- Be safe.
- Bye.

13:38.507 --> 13:39.716
Bye-bye.

13:46.299 --> 13:48.633
Oh, hello, sir.

13:48.633 --> 13:51.883
Um, might I interest you
in a 32-volume edition

13:51.883 --> 13:53.716
of the "Encyclopedia
Britannica"?

13:53.716 --> 13:56.382
Oh, you know, unfortunately,
I just bought a full set.

13:56.382 --> 14:00.215
A brunette just came by.
She was very persuasive.

14:00.215 --> 14:02.549
Oh, Veronica!

14:02.549 --> 14:04.841
Drats!
Foiled again.

14:04.841 --> 14:07.716
- Ah, well.
Good day, sir.
- Good day.

14:08.758 --> 14:09.716
Get in here.

14:11.090 --> 14:12.591
- Hello.
- Hi.

14:20.758 --> 14:23.132
- Oh, hey, Ella.
- Hi.

14:23.132 --> 14:26.257
- Good.

14:26.257 --> 14:27.841
- No.

14:27.841 --> 14:29.424
I think she should
be back in, like,
an hour, though.

14:29.424 --> 14:30.674
Do you wanna
come in and wait?

14:30.674 --> 14:32.007
No, no, no, it's good.

14:32.007 --> 14:33.507
I should've called first.

14:33.507 --> 14:35.382
I'll catch up
with her later.

14:35.382 --> 14:37.633
- I'll tell her you came by.
- All right.

14:37.633 --> 14:40.424
- Wait, Ella, um...

14:40.424 --> 14:44.716
- I'm here, so, uh...
- Yup.

14:44.716 --> 14:47.049
I don't really know
what is or is not

14:47.049 --> 14:50.299
going on with you
and-- and Tom.

14:50.299 --> 14:54.507
Just 'cause
I'm, heh, you know,
Commander Oblivious.

14:54.507 --> 14:56.841
- Well, I know
that you and your mom

14:56.841 --> 14:59.257
have an understanding
about sexuality,

14:59.257 --> 15:01.215
and I'm totally cool
with that.

15:01.215 --> 15:04.174
She explained it to me
and I'm totally okay
with that.

15:04.174 --> 15:06.965
Absolutely you be you.

15:06.965 --> 15:08.507
It's just that...

15:10.466 --> 15:15.049
you're more advanced
than Tom,

15:15.049 --> 15:20.549
uh, in the...
physical department,

15:20.549 --> 15:21.799
if that makes sense to you.

15:21.799 --> 15:23.965
And I just would hope

15:23.965 --> 15:28.841
that you wouldn't
push him along too quickly.

15:28.841 --> 15:30.799
Sure.

15:30.799 --> 15:32.633
All right,
look, I just had
another quick thought.

15:32.633 --> 15:34.174
Maybe whenever you guys
are alone together

15:34.174 --> 15:35.674
in any sort
of man-made structures,

15:35.674 --> 15:37.132
keep all the doors
and windows open?

15:37.132 --> 15:39.090
How's that sound?

15:39.090 --> 15:41.174
- Okay.
- Great!

15:41.174 --> 15:44.965
I'm glad we had this talk.
Cleared the deck.

15:44.965 --> 15:46.257
Cleared the air.

15:46.257 --> 15:47.799
All right.

15:47.799 --> 15:50.257
Let's soul shake on it.

15:50.257 --> 15:51.674
- Mm.
- All right,
tell your mom

15:51.674 --> 15:53.049
I'll catch up
with her later.

15:53.049 --> 15:55.507
And-- and just have
a great day.

15:55.507 --> 15:57.674
- Okay.
- All right.

15:59.633 --> 16:02.841
- Hey.
Look who's here.
- Hey.

16:02.841 --> 16:05.341
Just who I was
hoping to see.

16:05.341 --> 16:06.924
Oh.

16:06.924 --> 16:09.049
- Yeah.

16:09.049 --> 16:10.507
Good.

16:10.507 --> 16:13.341
Get those
endorphins going.

16:13.341 --> 16:15.424
Just really quick,

16:15.424 --> 16:18.424
I-- I wanted
to acknowledge that--

16:18.424 --> 16:21.758
that I'm aware that you--

16:21.758 --> 16:27.507
you have made some
recent advances sexually.

16:27.507 --> 16:29.382
- Oh, my God, Mom!
- No, no, no, no, no!

16:29.382 --> 16:31.341
Honey, I don't wanna
make you feel uncomfortable.

16:31.341 --> 16:32.883
You're not in trouble,
all right?

16:32.883 --> 16:35.924
This is a natural part
of growing up

16:35.924 --> 16:39.049
and becoming a young man.

16:39.049 --> 16:40.924
All right?
I have no problem...

16:40.924 --> 16:43.883
- I seriously
do have to go.
- ...with that.

16:43.883 --> 16:47.215
All right, but we--
we should-- we should
talk about consent.

16:47.215 --> 16:49.965
Our guidance counselor
already talked to us
about it.

16:49.965 --> 16:52.090
But, well,
did she tell you
that it's a--

16:52.090 --> 16:53.382
it's a two

16:53.382 --> 16:56.299
You know, 'cause consent
goes both ways.

16:56.299 --> 16:58.591
You know, like,
say for instance, I'm--

16:58.591 --> 17:01.883
say-- say, like--
like, a-- a girl

17:01.883 --> 17:02.965
wanted to kiss
your penis--

17:02.965 --> 17:04.924
- Mom!
- You know...

17:04.924 --> 17:06.841
All right,
just, no means no!

17:06.841 --> 17:08.924
You know?
And tie your shoe!

17:10.257 --> 17:12.257
Oh, my God.

17:12.257 --> 17:13.924
Jesus, you're old enough
to have sex

17:13.924 --> 17:17.466
and you still can't
tie your shoe?

17:20.341 --> 17:22.090
Did you threaten
my daughter?

17:22.090 --> 17:24.924
What? No.
Why would you say that?

17:24.924 --> 17:26.299
Ella said that
you went over there

17:26.299 --> 17:27.758
and told her
to stay away
from your son.

17:27.758 --> 17:29.507
That sounds
pretty threatening to me.

17:29.507 --> 17:30.965
That's not
what I meant at all.

17:30.965 --> 17:32.633
All I mentioned to her

17:32.633 --> 17:34.633
was that Tom is naive
in certain respects

17:34.633 --> 17:36.299
that she is clearly not,

17:36.299 --> 17:38.965
and that she might be
conscious of that
going forward.

17:38.965 --> 17:40.965
Why are you telling Ella
anything at all?

17:40.965 --> 17:42.299
She is my daughter.

17:42.299 --> 17:43.633
She doesn't need a dad.

17:43.633 --> 17:45.007
Hang on a second.

17:45.007 --> 17:47.507
Tom was involved in it, too.
I'm his dad.

17:47.507 --> 17:48.965
That means I get
to have an opinion,

17:48.965 --> 17:51.382
which you quite frankly
dismissed yesterday.

17:51.382 --> 17:53.299
I chose to raise
my daughter on my own,

17:53.299 --> 17:55.257
and we're doing
really fucking great.

17:55.257 --> 17:57.965
We just got
our co-brown belts
in aikido.

17:57.965 --> 18:01.965
So, we're all going
kung fu fighting?

18:01.965 --> 18:03.924
I don't know, maybe I am
better off on my own.

18:03.924 --> 18:05.341
Oh, come on!

18:05.341 --> 18:07.132
- I don't know!

18:08.716 --> 18:11.132
I need some time.

18:14.507 --> 18:17.382
This is
a real shitbasket, Tom.

18:18.758 --> 18:21.299
Diane:
Who gives a shit about
watching the sun rise?

18:21.299 --> 18:22.591
It's the sun.

18:22.591 --> 18:24.549
It does that
literally every day.

18:24.549 --> 18:26.633
Big whoop.

18:26.633 --> 18:28.841
Lately, Frances
seems hypnotized.

18:28.841 --> 18:32.382
Like Sylvia's
L. Ron Hubbard
or something.

18:32.382 --> 18:34.883
I accidentally dated
a Scientologist once.

18:34.883 --> 18:37.215
Really?
Very interesting.

18:37.215 --> 18:39.841
Now, over here
we have the café.

18:39.841 --> 18:41.716
- Good afternoon, Bruce.
- Bruce: Diane.

18:41.716 --> 18:44.174
Now, I like
to sit and watch
the tennis pros eat lunch.

18:44.174 --> 18:46.049
And wait
until you meet Jeremy.

18:46.049 --> 18:48.049
He's young and Australian.
Enough said.

18:48.049 --> 18:50.507
- Oh.
- And they just added the cutest
little smoothie bar.

18:50.507 --> 18:51.965
Oh, how nice.

18:51.965 --> 18:53.799
- Yes, finally.

18:53.799 --> 18:55.965
They started
letting them join
about three years ago.

18:55.965 --> 18:58.466
Now, over here
we have a locker room.

18:58.466 --> 19:00.883
- After you.
- Thank you.

19:02.633 --> 19:04.674
And then over here,
of course, they have the tea

19:04.674 --> 19:06.382
- with honey and lemon.
- Oh.

19:06.382 --> 19:08.466
And, you know,
I think their shampoo
is a little iffy,

19:08.466 --> 19:11.215
so if I were you,
I would bring my own.

19:13.382 --> 19:14.799
What are you doing here?

19:14.799 --> 19:17.174
Well, I-- I could say
the same for you.

19:17.174 --> 19:18.591
I joined
a couple weeks ago.

19:18.591 --> 19:20.424
I figured I would
just go full suburban.

19:20.424 --> 19:22.424
- Great to see you again,
Jackie.

19:22.424 --> 19:24.382
Oh, my God, Diane,
where are my manners?

19:24.382 --> 19:26.549
Hi. You look amazing!

19:26.549 --> 19:28.507
Oh, you're sweet.

19:28.507 --> 19:32.132
Well, if you'll excuse me,
ladies, I'm gonna go meet
Nick on the courts,

19:32.132 --> 19:33.674
so I'll see
you ladies later.

19:36.674 --> 19:39.883
I really miss you, Dallas.
I miss our visits.

19:39.883 --> 19:42.841
Isn't there any way
we can make this work?

19:42.841 --> 19:44.257
Unfortunately, no.

19:44.257 --> 19:46.424
It's simply
unprofessional for me

19:46.424 --> 19:49.758
to treat my best friend's
ex-husband's new girlfriend.

19:49.758 --> 19:53.299
But, um, you know,
all those other names
I gave you,

19:53.299 --> 19:56.758
they would be
just excellent
replacements.

19:56.758 --> 19:58.965
It's just that
with Robbie and I,

19:58.965 --> 20:02.257
I-- I actually have no idea
where we stand right now.

20:02.257 --> 20:03.716
We got in this big fight
about the kids,

20:03.716 --> 20:05.466
but it was not
really about the kids.

20:05.466 --> 20:07.090
- I really shouldn't be--

20:07.090 --> 20:09.424
And I know I always, like,
shut down relationships

20:09.424 --> 20:10.674
before they get serious.

20:10.674 --> 20:12.507
Your words,
but I find that this time

20:12.507 --> 20:15.299
I-- I really want to be
vulnerable with him,

20:15.299 --> 20:18.132
and I-- I keep hearing
your voice in my head.

20:18.132 --> 20:21.174
"Jackie, you will live
a very solitary life

20:21.174 --> 20:23.883
- if you stay boxed up
behind your own scaffolding."
- You know, I--

20:23.883 --> 20:25.716
- I really don't
think that's what I--
- "Jackie, you have to talk

20:25.716 --> 20:27.132
through
your feelings together.

20:27.132 --> 20:28.633
Don't shut him down.
He's not a mind reader.

20:28.633 --> 20:29.799
Those don't exist."

20:29.799 --> 20:32.799
God, you're so good
at what you do.

20:32.799 --> 20:35.965
Not doing anything.
Not treating you.

20:35.965 --> 20:37.507
Well, I've taken up
enough of your time

20:37.507 --> 20:40.174
and I should probably
go shower.

20:40.174 --> 20:42.758
I'm so pleased
that we ran into each other.

20:42.758 --> 20:46.549
- Yes, also inappropriate.

20:51.215 --> 20:53.591
- Ah, hey there, Diane.
- Hi, Jeremy.

20:53.591 --> 20:55.841
How are you doing?

20:57.883 --> 21:00.507
- Jeremy: Oh, sh...

21:00.507 --> 21:03.883
Well, everything seems okay.
There's no broken limbs.

21:03.883 --> 21:06.507
- Mm-hmm.
Is that okay?

21:06.507 --> 21:09.591
Well... I'm nodding,
so that's good.

21:09.591 --> 21:11.965
That means that
it's still attached
to my body.

21:13.674 --> 21:17.466
- I'm so embarrassed, Jeremy.
- Aw. No need, sweetheart.

21:17.466 --> 21:20.299
I'm bit of a klutz myself,
too, sometimes.

21:20.299 --> 21:21.674
But why don't
we sit you up?

21:21.674 --> 21:23.674
Is that head okay?
You're not feeling dizzy?

21:23.674 --> 21:25.215
No, I think I'm okay.

21:27.424 --> 21:30.466
- They just paged me.
- Oh, Nick, I had a slight...

21:30.466 --> 21:32.758
stumble on the stairs
over there.

21:32.758 --> 21:34.507
- It was actually
quite a tumble.

21:34.507 --> 21:36.007
She's a brave one,
though, isn't she?

21:36.007 --> 21:37.883
- Aw, you're so sweet.

21:37.883 --> 21:40.132
How's that ankle, though?
Why don't we just...

21:40.132 --> 21:42.299
All right,
well, then, uh...

21:42.299 --> 21:44.382
Jared, is it,
like the Subway guy?

21:44.382 --> 21:46.633
- Jeremy, actually.
- Jeremy.

21:46.633 --> 21:48.090
Great.
Thanks very much,

21:48.090 --> 21:49.883
but I-- I think
I've got this, okay?

21:49.883 --> 21:52.049
- No, I'm happy to stay and--
- No, no, that's okay.

21:52.049 --> 21:54.132
If you could get
somebody else here,

21:54.132 --> 21:56.924
preferably somebody
with a college education,
that'd be great.

21:56.924 --> 21:58.507
Okay?
Thank you.

22:00.215 --> 22:02.591
You okay?
I'm here now, sweetheart.

22:02.591 --> 22:03.965
It's all right.
What?

22:03.965 --> 22:05.507
You're jealous.

22:05.507 --> 22:07.674
- I am not.
- You are!

22:07.674 --> 22:09.716
I can tell,
and it's so adorable.

22:09.716 --> 22:11.049
Well, I was worried
about you.

22:11.049 --> 22:12.924
I didn't know what--
holy Jesus Christ,

22:12.924 --> 22:15.215
it's like a fucking
head goiter back here.

22:26.299 --> 22:28.215
I hate to tell you
this, but, uh,

22:28.215 --> 22:30.799
you've got
a large family of squirrels
moving into your attic.

22:30.799 --> 22:33.924
- Yeah.

22:33.924 --> 22:35.633
And by the looks of it,
they're gonna stay awhile.

22:35.633 --> 22:36.883
See all the luggage?

22:36.883 --> 22:39.090
I keep trying
to get rid of them.

22:39.090 --> 22:41.299
Clearly,
you're too hospitable.

22:43.591 --> 22:45.215
I've been called worse.

22:48.633 --> 22:50.424
Oh!

22:58.257 --> 23:00.758
All right.
Jump out.

23:00.758 --> 23:03.965
Go get your retainer
and we'll drop you
at the sleepover.

23:03.965 --> 23:06.215
Then Tom and I
are rolling out

23:06.215 --> 23:07.924
for guys' night
at the movies.

23:07.924 --> 23:09.799
You could've been
a part of it.

23:15.466 --> 23:17.090
Lila: Mom?

23:17.090 --> 23:18.007
Oh!

23:18.007 --> 23:20.174
- Oh, Lila.
- Shit.

23:20.174 --> 23:21.591
Lila.

23:21.591 --> 23:24.132
No, no, wait,
wait, wait!
Li, Li!

23:24.132 --> 23:26.341
Lila, wait, wait.
Lila!

23:26.341 --> 23:29.758
Well, well, well.
What have we here?

23:29.758 --> 23:31.466
Lila, honey,
do you wanna talk?

23:31.466 --> 23:33.382
- No.
- Frances: Oh, hi, Tom!

23:33.382 --> 23:34.924
- Robert DuFresne.
- Hi.

23:34.924 --> 23:37.132
- Ex-husband.
- Hi. Andrew Wallace.

23:37.132 --> 23:38.758
- Pleasure.
- Good to see you.

23:38.758 --> 23:40.883
Looks like your side
of the street

23:40.883 --> 23:42.466
was up
to something naughty.

23:42.466 --> 23:46.549
My side thought your side
had the kids tonight.

23:46.549 --> 23:49.132
And you saw this
as an opportunity

23:49.132 --> 23:50.674
for a random hookup?

23:50.674 --> 23:51.799
For fun?

23:51.799 --> 23:54.841
No. No.
No, this isn't random.

23:54.841 --> 23:57.132
This is scheduled.

23:57.132 --> 23:58.841
Like a get-together.

23:58.841 --> 24:00.049
Mm-hmm.

24:01.507 --> 24:02.674
I mean, we're a thing.

24:02.674 --> 24:04.466
Congratulations.

24:04.466 --> 24:07.007
I'm gonna take Lila
over to her sleepover.

24:07.007 --> 24:08.007
It was nice meeting you.

24:08.007 --> 24:09.424
- You, too.
- Andrew.

24:09.424 --> 24:11.007
- Yes.
- Guess we'll be seeing

24:11.007 --> 24:14.549
you kids together more often
now that you're a "thing."

24:14.549 --> 24:16.507
Maybe next time
you'll have your fly up.

24:16.507 --> 24:18.674
- Oh.
- Yeah. Protocol.

24:18.674 --> 24:20.466
Just-- just saying.

24:20.466 --> 24:23.007
All right.
Bye, kids.

24:23.007 --> 24:26.382
Lila? Lila, put your
seat belt on, okay?

24:26.382 --> 24:29.049
Bye, Tom.
Put-- Lila,
put your seat belt on.

24:31.883 --> 24:34.758
So, everything here
looks pretty good to me.

24:34.758 --> 24:37.883
The Clavowens have agreed
to sponsor your membership

24:37.883 --> 24:40.257
and we have a lengthy
self-submitted letter

24:40.257 --> 24:43.299
of recommendation
from a Jackie Gianopoulos.

24:43.299 --> 24:47.382
Oh, uh, Jackie and I aren't
actually that close.

24:47.382 --> 24:50.424
Oh, she said
you used to be
her therapist.

24:50.424 --> 24:53.841
Oh, "used to."
Hmm, that's progress.

24:53.841 --> 24:56.215
Well, um, I can't see
any reason why

24:56.215 --> 24:57.799
your application
wouldn't be accepted.

24:57.799 --> 24:59.924
Now, were you interested
in the family membership
at all?

24:59.924 --> 25:02.883
No. I mean, I just--
I don't think that's
gonna be necessary.

25:02.883 --> 25:06.924
My son's not much for sports
or, uh, socializing.

25:06.924 --> 25:10.132
And he's about to leave
for school, anyway, so.

25:10.132 --> 25:13.591
Okay.
Now, for a spouse, then,
we have a dual option.

25:13.591 --> 25:14.965
No.

25:14.965 --> 25:17.549
No spouse.

25:17.549 --> 25:19.965
So, you were
just interested in the--

25:19.965 --> 25:21.424
in the single membership,
then?

25:21.424 --> 25:22.674
Correct.

25:22.674 --> 25:25.466
Yeah, just-- just me.

25:25.466 --> 25:29.507
- Single me.
- Well, no problem.

25:29.507 --> 25:30.883
Join the club.

25:45.466 --> 25:48.591
- I come in peace.
- Okay.

25:48.591 --> 25:52.633
So... you know
how I'm always good
at everything, right?

25:52.633 --> 25:54.382
That is debatable.

25:54.382 --> 25:57.090
Well,
it turns out that...

25:57.090 --> 26:00.674
I'm not very good
at letting someone
into my life.

26:00.674 --> 26:02.090
You were
absolutely right.

26:02.090 --> 26:04.132
I should've considered
your feelings

26:04.132 --> 26:06.341
about Tom and Ella.

26:06.341 --> 26:07.674
I'm so sorry.

26:10.257 --> 26:12.799
Well, I hope
Ella doesn't think

26:12.799 --> 26:16.174
- I'm the old,
weird guy now.
- It's okay.

26:16.174 --> 26:18.799
This is where
you're supposed to say,

26:18.799 --> 26:20.674
"Ella doesn't think
you're the weird, old guy."

26:21.633 --> 26:24.633
Well, you're not old.

26:24.633 --> 26:27.466
And I love
that you're weird.

26:29.299 --> 26:32.633
I really like you,
Robbie.

26:32.633 --> 26:34.716
I wanna make this work.

26:37.007 --> 26:39.007
I like you, too.

26:46.341 --> 26:50.049
Oh, um,
bad news/good news.

26:50.049 --> 26:51.549
Tom ended things
with Ella.

26:51.549 --> 26:53.841
Oh. Is she okay?

26:53.841 --> 26:55.674
Oh, yeah.
She's back
into girls now.

26:55.674 --> 26:56.716
Good for her.

26:56.716 --> 26:58.132
♪ Making a living... ♪

26:58.132 --> 26:59.716
Oh, yes.

26:59.716 --> 27:03.007
Look at us,
out together,
eating food

27:03.007 --> 27:03.924
in public.

27:03.924 --> 27:05.341
It's like a real date.

27:05.341 --> 27:09.174
Well, I figured
you can't fight city hall.

27:09.174 --> 27:10.633
So why try, right?

27:10.633 --> 27:12.215
- Or alternate theory.
- Mm-hmm.

27:12.215 --> 27:14.090
Did you invite me to dinner
so I wouldn't just be the guy

27:14.090 --> 27:16.674
who met your entire family
with his fly down?

27:18.215 --> 27:21.090
Well, that's not
not why I asked.

27:21.090 --> 27:24.549
Well, whatever
prompted the leap,

27:24.549 --> 27:29.049
this thing
is not so bad, is it?

27:29.049 --> 27:32.424
Mm-mm.
Not so bad at all.

ANDREW: We both
had some growing up to do.

29:17.841 --> 29:19.758
Her version of growing up was
sleeping with our contractor.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.382
What about you? What was
the nail in your marriage?

29:22.799 --> 29:24.174
FRANCES DUFRESNE:
Oh, my God. Skip Zakarian.

29:24.174 --> 29:25.799
-Yeah, the gallery owner guy,
right?
-Yeah.

29:25.799 --> 29:26.965
I'm Frances Everdell.

29:26.965 --> 29:28.382
-Nice to meet you.
-You too!

29:28.382 --> 29:29.674
An-- And-- Bye.

29:30.299 --> 29:31.716
We should officially
do business.

29:31.716 --> 29:34.090
I buy the houses and you design
and renovate,

29:34.090 --> 29:36.090
and we turn a tidy profit.

29:36.507 --> 29:38.007
Skip Zakarian sent that?

29:38.007 --> 29:39.633
He's obviously
flirting with you.

29:39.841 --> 29:41.341
That prick from
the auction. He's here.

29:41.341 --> 29:42.049
Really?

29:42.507 --> 29:44.633
If it weren't for you,
I'd still be at the bank.

29:44.633 --> 29:46.341
-You're very welcome.
-There's one more thing.
