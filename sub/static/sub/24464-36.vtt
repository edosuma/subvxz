00:12.000 --> 00:15.590
Margaret,  more coffee please.

00:15.630 --> 00:17.380
I'm the pizza king!

00:25.730 --> 00:27.470
Muscle Man? Dude!

00:31.780 --> 00:33.490
Muscle Man,  quit it!

00:38.600 --> 00:41.010
I thought I told them to clean this up!

00:41.010 --> 00:42.590
I don't know what happened!

00:42.590 --> 00:44.780
Yeah right!  You're just trying to prank us.

00:44.780 --> 00:46.540
It's not a prank!

00:46.540 --> 00:49.640
Yeah,  I got a few bruised ribs because of you! !

00:49.670 --> 00:52.850
You wouldn't stop hitting me until I pretended to be dead.

00:52.850 --> 00:55.460
You smashed my model train set.

00:55.460 --> 00:57.410
How did you even find out where I live?!

00:57.440 --> 00:59.900
I'm sorry,  I didn't mean to.

00:59.900 --> 01:01.180
What's going on?

01:01.310 --> 01:03.470
Muscle Man's beating people up in his sleep.

01:03.470 --> 01:06.670
I wouldn't do that.  I hate senseless violence.

01:07.430 --> 01:10.250
I seriously can't rememeber fighting you guys! !

01:10.250 --> 01:12.470
At this rate,  he's gonna put us all in the hospital.

01:12.470 --> 01:14.700
- Benson,  we gotta do something.  - "We"?

01:14.830 --> 01:18.470
Yeah.  This is a park problem.  Everyone's gotta be on board.

01:18.560 --> 01:20.820
This has nothing to do with me.

01:20.850 --> 01:24.320
Anything that happens in the park after hours is your own problem.

01:35.380 --> 01:37.830
Okay,  this is a park problem.

01:37.920 --> 01:40.800
Yeah it is.  Thomas lost a tooth last night.

01:41.050 --> 01:43.270
I still don't know how he knows where I live. . .

01:43.290 --> 01:46.070
And Rigby won't go to sleep unless we barricade our bedroom door.

01:46.070 --> 01:48.480
Sleep in the hallway if you want,  it's your funeral.

01:48.480 --> 01:49.960
I don't know what's wrong with me.

01:49.990 --> 01:52.020
It's not like I want to hurt you guys.

01:52.070 --> 01:55.340
Yeah,  well you obviously have no control over yourself while your sleep fighting.

01:55.440 --> 01:58.880
Your sleep strength is double your normal strength.

01:58.920 --> 02:01.200
Nobody safe until we get you to stop.

02:01.370 --> 02:05.100
We gotta find the source of your problem and take it head on!

02:05.120 --> 02:06.750
What if I can't be fixed?

02:06.800 --> 02:10.320
Am I just be a sleep fighting freak for the rest of my life?

02:10.330 --> 02:11.570
Don't worry Muscle Man.

02:11.620 --> 02:13.280
We won't give up until you're cured.

02:13.420 --> 02:15.770
Thanks guys,  you're the best.

02:17.860 --> 02:20.600
- Muscle Man,  can you hear me? - Loud and clear bro.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.270
Okay,  we're gonna get started.

02:22.330 --> 02:26.090
Wait,  I understand the ropes but what are all these cameras for?

02:26.250 --> 02:28.300
You're not gonna do anything weird,  right?

02:28.340 --> 02:30.810
Relax.  We're just gonna watch you sleep.

02:30.830 --> 02:34.820
We think your sleep fighting is being caused by night terrors.

02:34.840 --> 02:37.540
If we figure out what kind of dreams you're having,

02:37.540 --> 02:39.820
we might be able to cure you.

02:39.940 --> 02:42.540
But what if I break out and hurt you guys again?

02:42.710 --> 02:44.650
We padlocked your trailer from the outside,

02:44.700 --> 02:45.950
plus you have to get through Rigby

02:45.950 --> 02:48.770
and he's wearing a police attack-dog suit that we found in the trash.

02:50.840 --> 02:52.570
There's no way you can get to us!

02:52.570 --> 02:55.570
Okay,  here we go Muscle Man.  And. . .

02:58.310 --> 03:00.750
Ugh,  what is this junk?

03:21.510 --> 03:22.870
Guys,  wake up.

03:23.640 --> 03:25.170
I think he's dreaming.

03:27.140 --> 03:28.520
Turn up the volume.

03:30.610 --> 03:32.110
No,  get off of me!

03:32.690 --> 03:33.750
Let go!

03:34.660 --> 03:37.300
Whatever he's seeing,  it's intense.

03:42.320 --> 03:43.680
He's breaking loose!

03:46.690 --> 03:50.340
I'm gonna turn your face into a meatball pizza!

03:57.330 --> 03:58.130
Look!

03:59.510 --> 04:00.660
Where's Muscle Man?

04:08.000 --> 04:08.900
You're on dude.

04:09.180 --> 04:10.470
Please don't make me-

04:15.950 --> 04:18.350
- Not my face!  - Sorry Rigby.

04:18.350 --> 04:20.370
The suit's not working!

04:24.900 --> 04:29.150
Thanks a lot guys,  for being such great spectators.

04:29.150 --> 04:31.850
I do hope we figure this out soon.

04:31.940 --> 04:35.280
I don't know how much more chaos I can endure.

04:35.310 --> 04:36.480
So what's Plan B?

04:36.520 --> 04:39.750
Plan B is to say bye bye,  Muscle Man.

04:39.750 --> 04:41.520
What!  Were are you going?

04:41.530 --> 04:45.130
Some place far away where I can't hurt you guys anymore,

04:45.240 --> 04:47.430
across town into cheep motels.

04:47.430 --> 04:49.730
- What? - You got us to try and help you!

04:49.730 --> 04:51.310
We just got started!

04:51.310 --> 04:53.970
And I'm ending it!  Goodbye,  bros.

04:53.990 --> 04:54.640
Wait!

04:54.640 --> 04:57.330
I was going over surveillance tape from last night.

04:57.330 --> 04:58.860
There's something you guys got to see.

05:02.300 --> 05:05.330
Ok, ok that's not what I want to show you guys.

05:05.330 --> 05:06.660
Check this out!

05:08.630 --> 05:10.530
Could be a technological glitch.

05:10.530 --> 05:13.030
No, wait, can you get closely to look, Fives?

05:16.100 --> 05:18.830
What's that?Off Muscle Man's sweat.

05:21.830 --> 05:23.900
Let me zoom in the resolution.

05:25.500 --> 05:27.430
- Creepy - What is that?

05:27.430 --> 05:31.000
The camera must have picked up some randoms of your dream.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.600
Did you recognize these things?

05:32.600 --> 05:34.330
No, bro.

05:36.230 --> 05:40.430
Goodbye, sweety.  Mommy loves you.

05:40.430 --> 05:44.430
We will be gone until tomorrow night. Are you sure you can handle this, Mitch?

05:44.430 --> 05:47.530
Come baby, I can take care of little baby.

05:47.530 --> 05:50.360
-Go have fun with your sister and your curling tournament- Ok.

05:50.460 --> 05:56.260
Miss you, Muscle Muffin.

05:56.260 --> 05:59.730
Miss you too, Pork Chop. Bring home the gold.

06:00.330 --> 06:04.230
Alright, time to switch on the wheel babysitter.

06:04.230 --> 06:07.930
Wait, Mr. Bank Robber. Don't you want to play?

06:07.930 --> 06:10.000
You huggstables stay away from me.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.330
I know.  Let's give him a hug.

06:15.200 --> 06:15.960
Next.

06:15.960 --> 06:18.930
Destroy! Destroy! Destroy!

06:18.930 --> 06:21.600
The world's craziest crash pits.

06:21.600 --> 06:22.900
Aright.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.500
What?Are you sick?hunger?you make a mess in your diaper.

06:31.560 --> 06:32.930
No. Get back.

06:39.100 --> 06:42.800
Oh no, he is beautiful glitter.

06:43.630 --> 06:45.900
Let sing the glitter song.

06:45.900 --> 06:49.930
Glitter shredder... Glitter shredder...

06:49.930 --> 06:51.430
Creepy!

06:51.430 --> 06:54.730
Oh no, more troubles.

06:54.730 --> 06:59.230
Hugstables! hug!

07:00.400 --> 07:02.930
Why won't they stop hurting people?

07:04.830 --> 07:06.230
Hug time.

07:06.330 --> 07:08.160
Help me!

07:09.760 --> 07:11.830
What a hug?

07:12.860 --> 07:14.230
I try to turn it off.

07:14.230 --> 07:17.560
But every time I did,  the baby was starting crying again.

07:17.560 --> 07:22.500
They played all the 8 seasons 257 episodes.

07:22.500 --> 07:26.560
Back to back, when Starla and her sister found me the next day,

07:26.560 --> 07:29.230
I was crying in the ball on the floor.

07:29.230 --> 07:31.130
It's sounds like the show messed you up pretty bad.

07:31.130 --> 07:33.730
That must be thing was causing your nightmares.

07:33.800 --> 07:35.860
Do I keep them out of my head?

07:35.860 --> 07:39.610
Pops, you still have the dream catcher I let you brower

07:39.640 --> 07:42.080
when you having that talking dogs nightmares?

07:42.090 --> 07:45.860
Yes, they ride the bicycles now, but it's not a scary.

07:45.860 --> 07:49.060
Good, I have a plan.

07:50.860 --> 07:55.530
So, when I give the word, tell the dream catcher toward Muscle Man.

07:55.530 --> 07:57.760
and drawm out nightmare.

07:57.760 --> 07:59.130
How delightful!

07:59.130 --> 08:02.160
I usually miss this part because I am in the sleep.

08:12.760 --> 08:13.800
Oh no, bro.

08:13.810 --> 08:17.360
Do you want a hug?Come on, friends.

08:17.360 --> 08:19.360
Let's give them a hug.

08:21.730 --> 08:22.560
Hugs, hugs, hugs.

08:25.360 --> 08:27.730
Get off me, you freak.

08:34.500 --> 08:35.530
Now.

08:37.929 --> 08:39.230
It's working.

08:41.200 --> 08:43.299
Why are these ao many?

08:43.299 --> 08:45.600
Muscle Man watched 8 seasons words.

08:48.060 --> 08:50.060
That's too many of them.

09:12.530 --> 09:14.100
- Hugs.  - Hug this.

09:17.630 --> 09:19.300
Grab a weapon.

09:19.300 --> 09:20.430
Cool.

09:26.060 --> 09:28.260
Skips Why do you have all this stuff?

09:28.260 --> 09:32.530
Wait as old as me, you will have some real crazy dreams.

09:41.960 --> 09:43.100
Shoot, it's full.

09:43.200 --> 09:46.560
Hugs, hugs, hugs, hugs, hugs.

09:49.430 --> 09:51.600
- Bad show. - Pops.

09:55.400 --> 09:56.730
Do we get them all?

10:00.100 --> 10:02.230
Want a hug!

10:04.900 --> 10:06.630
We're out of dream catchers.

10:06.630 --> 10:08.700
No. there still one left.

10:13.430 --> 10:16.160
Skips, this dream catcher is way too small.

10:16.160 --> 10:19.300
I wasn't talking about that dream catcher.

10:20.900 --> 10:23.830
I told you guys to put that ramp away.

10:23.830 --> 10:27.100
You gonna be glad they didn't. Hang on!

10:35.560 --> 10:36.400
What?

10:37.230 --> 10:42.130
I head the weirdest dream, you were in it, you were in it.

10:42.130 --> 10:43.660
You weren't, Thomas.

10:44.200 --> 10:45.560
Sounds like you cured.

10:45.560 --> 10:49.530
You got those things out my head?I really owe you guys a big time.

10:49.530 --> 10:53.130
Don't mention it. Now, let's all go get some sleep.

10:53.130 --> 10:56.430
But before we do, group hug?

10:57.530 --> 10:58.730
No, thanks Pops.
