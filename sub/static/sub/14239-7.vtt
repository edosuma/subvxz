WEBVTT

00:02.920 --> 00:06.880
Torchwood. Outside the Government,
beyond the Police.

00:06.880 --> 00:12.240
Tracking down alien life
on Earth and arming the
human race against the future.

00:12.240 --> 00:15.160
The 21st century is when
everything changes,

00:15.160 --> 00:16.800
and you've got to be ready.

00:31.039 --> 00:33.439
Nearly there.

00:33.439 --> 00:36.559
We've been right busy since
you lot were billeted here.

00:36.559 --> 00:38.239
This your first time?

00:38.239 --> 00:40.200
The others been
teasing you, is that it?

00:40.200 --> 00:44.599
My name's Mary.

00:44.599 --> 00:46.519
Mary, like the virgin.

00:49.440 --> 00:51.439
Religious man, are ya?

00:57.120 --> 00:58.639
I'm not your bloody hound.

01:08.479 --> 01:09.919
Whore!

01:32.119 --> 01:34.879
METALLIC WHOOSHING

02:11.599 --> 02:14.119
Do whores have prayers?

03:09.440 --> 03:12.319
Once, just once, I'd like
to walk into one of these tents

03:12.319 --> 03:14.639
and find it's a party.

03:14.639 --> 03:18.520
You know, food, drink, people
dancing, girl crying in the corner.

03:18.520 --> 03:19.879
Is it alien? And how.

03:19.879 --> 03:24.359
I'm picking up traces of ilmenite,
pyroxene, and even Dark Matter.

03:24.359 --> 03:26.639
Any idea what it is? Not a clue.

03:26.639 --> 03:29.160
Could be a weapon,
or a really big stapler.

03:29.160 --> 03:31.000
How's our friend there? She's dead.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.120
Yeah, thanks, Quincy(!) She?

03:33.120 --> 03:35.840
Judging by the size of her skull.
How long have they been here, Tosh?

03:35.840 --> 03:41.800
From the depth they found them...
196 years, 11 to 11.5 months.

03:41.800 --> 03:44.519
The earth's been disturbed so I'm
afraid I can't be more accurate.

03:44.519 --> 03:46.599
What killed her? The stapler?

03:46.599 --> 03:49.879
Nah. See those shattered ribs?

03:49.879 --> 03:52.040
I reckon she was shot.

03:52.040 --> 03:54.079
Well, let's get her back
to the Hub and find out.

03:56.760 --> 03:59.520
You're so light! You're like a girl.

03:59.520 --> 04:03.000
I'm not light, I'm wiry.
Fat girls go mad for it.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.120
But I guess I don't need
to tell you that.

04:19.920 --> 04:25.159
I'm really sorry, I think
your computer might be dead.

04:25.159 --> 04:27.439
You're kidding. What happened?

04:27.439 --> 04:29.920
OK, so she said I was no
good at sport... Hello?!

04:29.920 --> 04:31.719
So I said,
"Throw something to me and..."

04:31.719 --> 04:33.880
What happened to the computer? Oh.

04:33.880 --> 04:35.479
I kicked out the plug.

04:37.080 --> 04:39.399
What? It was running a
translation programme I'd written.

04:39.399 --> 04:42.319
I'd collated every scrap of alien
language we've got,

04:42.319 --> 04:46.399
and broken it
down into binary threads to see
if there was a common derivation.

04:46.399 --> 04:48.439
That's a bit of a mouthful.

04:48.439 --> 04:54.279
Sorry. Private joke. Um, stupid joke.
We're supposed to be professionals.

04:54.279 --> 04:59.160
We've got a job to do. She's right.
You're right, Tosh, I'm sorry.

05:00.760 --> 05:05.319
Do you know what, Tosh? Sometimes I
think even that stick up your arse

05:05.319 --> 05:07.080
has got a stick up its arse.

05:26.880 --> 05:32.040
The guy over there's been staring at
me all evening, and I told him he's
wasting his time but he won't listen,

05:32.040 --> 05:35.200
so I've come over to talk to
you because I know how this ends -

05:35.200 --> 05:40.879
he gets a punch in the neck
and I get barred, and I've already
been barred from about 20 pubs.

05:40.879 --> 05:45.120
And I don't want to get barred
from this one because they do
these nice olives on the tables.

05:45.120 --> 05:47.520
Right. OK, then.

05:47.520 --> 05:49.320
Cool. Let me get you a drink.

05:49.320 --> 05:52.040
Really, there's no need.
JD and Coke, and...
Toshiko, what do you want?

05:52.040 --> 05:57.480
I didn't tell you my name.
Oh, yeah. That was the other thing.

05:57.480 --> 06:01.920
I kind of know who you are. I think
you're mistaken. Toshiko Sato.

06:01.920 --> 06:07.520
Born in London, 1975,
moved to Osaka when you were two,
then back to the UK in 1986.

06:07.520 --> 06:10.920
Parents in the RAF,
grandfather worked at Bletchley Park.

06:10.920 --> 06:12.719
Very impressive.

06:12.719 --> 06:18.279
University...blah-blah,
snapped up to Government science
think tank when you were 20,

06:18.279 --> 06:21.039
recruited to Torchwood
three years ago.

06:21.039 --> 06:24.280
I saw you at the
building site this morning.

06:24.280 --> 06:30.280
What was that you had in the case?
How do you know about Torchwood?

06:30.280 --> 06:34.479
There's stuff on the internet,
but you have to dig really deep.

06:34.479 --> 06:38.239
Plus, we pick bits and pieces up from
police radio scanners, we also... We?

06:38.239 --> 06:40.680
Scavengers.

06:40.680 --> 06:43.360
Collectors. Just like you.

06:43.360 --> 06:45.679
How many of there are you?

06:45.679 --> 06:49.440
Oh, listen, don't think
it's in any way organised.

06:49.440 --> 06:53.280
It's really just a disparate bunch of
IT guys who live with their mothers.

06:53.280 --> 06:55.719
I shouldn't talk to you.

06:55.719 --> 06:57.679
So go.

07:04.480 --> 07:07.719
What's most amazing are the
similarities with our own culture.

07:07.719 --> 07:11.599
But that can be horrible,
because we find lots of weapons,

07:11.599 --> 07:15.480
and it just makes you think,
"My God, everything wages war."

07:15.480 --> 07:18.959
It's not just a trait of
ours, but a trait of existence.

07:18.959 --> 07:22.080
It makes you feel so hopeless.

07:22.080 --> 07:24.840
But then there are times...

07:24.840 --> 07:29.799
We found this thing,
it was about A4 size,
and it had all these symbols on it.

07:29.799 --> 07:36.039
And it took me about three months
to translate, and it was a letter
someone had written to his family,

07:36.039 --> 07:39.080
to his children,
to say how much he was missing them.

07:39.080 --> 07:40.600
And it just made me cry,

07:40.600 --> 07:44.640
because I thought, even across
these unimaginable distances,

07:44.640 --> 07:48.039
there are fundamentals that
stay exactly the same.

07:48.039 --> 07:53.719
And there's no-one
to talk to about this. I mean,
the guys at work, they're great,

07:53.719 --> 07:56.920
but they don't...
see it the way I do.

07:59.839 --> 08:02.800
I could be fired...just
for telling you that.

08:05.359 --> 08:07.000
I want to show you something.

08:09.439 --> 08:12.799
It's a pendant. Put it on.

08:18.559 --> 08:22.119
VOICES ECHO: I'll drink one more,
then just drive slowly. Does coffee
count as food if you take sugar?

08:22.119 --> 08:24.519
If he tugs his groin one more time,
I'll smack him in the face...

08:24.519 --> 08:28.240
I should have said it
was Hammer Time when she
asked what the time was.

08:28.240 --> 08:30.400
That would have made them laugh.
What are they?

08:30.400 --> 08:32.078
I can hear voices.

08:32.078 --> 08:34.200
Bloody Sudoku...

08:34.200 --> 08:36.198
Did I send that email?

08:36.198 --> 08:41.318
Did I click "reply to all"?
They're people's thoughts.
He doesn't touch me any more.

08:41.318 --> 08:42.919
They're people's thoughts, Toshiko.

08:42.919 --> 08:45.919
'I wish I'd shagged
that single dad I met.'

08:45.919 --> 08:49.120
'What's that Asian girl doing -
having a fit or something?'

08:49.120 --> 08:51.439
It's... They're so loud.

08:51.439 --> 08:53.679
'She's cute, though.
Is that her girlfriend?

08:53.679 --> 08:57.039
'Marcus reckons he's done it
with two lesbians, lucky sod.

08:57.039 --> 08:59.680
'How would it work?'
That man over there with...

08:59.680 --> 09:04.600
I can hear him.
OK, Toshiko, I need you to focus.

09:04.600 --> 09:07.399
I can hear all of them.

09:07.399 --> 09:09.999
'Home in on my voice.
Shut everything else out.'

09:14.199 --> 09:18.199
It's so... 'Just me. There's
no-one else but me. Can you hear me?

09:18.199 --> 09:20.679
'Can you hear me now?

09:20.679 --> 09:23.760
'OK, I want you to home
in on just MY thoughts.

09:23.760 --> 09:25.719
'Ignore everything else.
There's just so much...'

09:25.719 --> 09:29.199
'You can do it. It takes practice,
but this is what you have to learn.

09:29.199 --> 09:31.719
'Now, what am I thinking?

09:31.719 --> 09:33.919
'This is so hard...

09:33.919 --> 09:36.240
'Follow my voice. What am I thinking?

09:36.240 --> 09:40.000
'You're thinking...
That I want to kiss you...'

09:40.000 --> 09:42.600
I'm sorry, that was...
No, look, it's...

09:42.600 --> 09:44.559
Sometimes you can't control...

09:44.559 --> 09:47.320
I know, it's fine.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.399
Where did you get it?

09:49.399 --> 09:51.480
It's been in the family a long time.

09:51.480 --> 09:53.839
I've never seen anything like it.
It's incredible.

09:53.839 --> 09:59.880
It's more than incredible. With this,
you can read people's minds. It
levels the pitch between man and God.

09:59.880 --> 10:02.719
Is it alien? I guess.

10:02.719 --> 10:05.160
No, I want you to keep it.

10:05.160 --> 10:09.720
What? I can't, Mary. Please.

10:09.720 --> 10:13.560
I've kept it too long.
After a while, it gets...

10:13.560 --> 10:15.480
You hear too much.

10:15.480 --> 10:18.440
It changes how you...see people.

10:18.440 --> 10:20.359
I'll have to show it to the others.

10:20.359 --> 10:22.200
What?

10:22.200 --> 10:27.399
Nothing. Just, I bet you don't.
And you know this from finding
my CV on the internet?

10:29.000 --> 10:32.760
No, because I know the pendant.
Well, you're wrong.

10:32.760 --> 10:36.360
Because I will. Yeah. But you won't.

10:55.960 --> 10:57.559
Good morning.

10:57.559 --> 10:59.240
Yeah, hi...

10:59.240 --> 11:00.679
Ianto.

11:16.359 --> 11:19.200
'What the hell would produce
such a perfect circular puncture?

11:19.200 --> 11:21.960
'Maybe some kind of wooden stake.
Hey, Tosh.

11:21.960 --> 11:25.399
'She'd better not go into one
about the computer again.' Morning.

11:25.399 --> 11:27.879
'Sergeant giving it all, "Oh, Gwennie
has deigned to call her old mates."

11:27.879 --> 11:31.000
'Should put a weevil
in his bathroom.'
I've got something to show you.

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
Sure. 'Please don't make us sit
through another slideshow about
the Incas or whatever it was.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.400
'I want a biscuit.'

11:37.400 --> 11:42.400
Have I got time for a pee first?
'Oh, the jeans in the boots thing
has really kind of had its day.'

11:42.400 --> 11:45.920
I...I found this thing...
'What's she talking about?
She can be dead weird.

11:45.920 --> 11:51.199
'Wonder what she'd be like in bed.
Catholic but grateful, I bet.' OK.

11:51.199 --> 11:55.200
Um, I don't know if this comes under
actual technology.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.559
'I can smell Owen on me from that
shag in his car this morning.

11:57.559 --> 12:01.840
'That's twice now - does that
make it an arrangement? Has to
be more than two times surely...

12:01.840 --> 12:05.560
'Long as we keep it to just
the two times we're fine. What's
Tosh looking at?' You OK, Tosh?

12:05.560 --> 12:08.999
'When she ran her
tongue across my teeth...

12:08.999 --> 12:12.679
'I should have worn different
trousers - I'm gonna have to sit
down till this subsides a bit.'

12:12.679 --> 12:15.879
Yeah. No. Fine.
So what is it you wanted to show us?

12:15.879 --> 12:20.360
'I wonder if I could get Owen to come
down to the vault. No, couldn't
have sex in front of a weevil.

12:20.360 --> 12:24.480
'I couldn't even do it in front of
Trevor Kendall's cat.' Forget it.

12:24.480 --> 12:28.759
It's... I found this article...
I'll bring it in tomorrow.

12:28.759 --> 12:32.840
No worries. 'But thanks for that
rambling trip to nowhere, Tosh.'

12:42.160 --> 12:44.320
'Can't imagine the time
when this isn't everything.

12:44.320 --> 12:49.080
'Pain so constant,
like my stomach's full of rats.

12:49.080 --> 12:51.559
'Feels like this is all I am now.

12:51.559 --> 12:53.799
'There isn't an inch of
me that doesn't hurt.'

12:56.160 --> 12:58.600
I'm about to brew some of
Jack's industrial strength coffee.

12:58.600 --> 13:01.039
Would you like a cup?

13:01.039 --> 13:04.920
I'm... I'm fine. Thanks, Ianto.

13:17.279 --> 13:20.199
Might have known you'd
have my address as well.

13:20.199 --> 13:23.440
Did you tell them? No. I didn't.

13:41.400 --> 13:43.879
What made you change your mind?

13:43.879 --> 13:45.480
You listened to them, didn't you?

13:45.480 --> 13:48.399
See, I told you! Isn't it incredible?

13:48.399 --> 13:50.599
Some of the stuff you hear...

13:52.879 --> 13:57.079
What is this thing?
Why did you give it to me?

13:57.079 --> 13:59.160
I told you. The things I heard.

13:59.160 --> 14:04.879
What they thought of me, what they
really thought. God, these are
people that are supposed to like me!

14:04.879 --> 14:07.519
They do like you.

14:07.519 --> 14:09.919
People are complicated, they...

14:09.919 --> 14:12.439
OK, I should have
warned you about this.

14:12.439 --> 14:15.520
It isn't like reading
someone's diary.

14:19.680 --> 14:25.359
The stuff you've been hearing, it's
so deep, so personal - stuff they're
not even aware they're thinking.

14:27.759 --> 14:31.200
You think you know someone, then
suddenly you see them for real,

14:32.959 --> 14:34.959
and they're...bastard little kids.

14:34.959 --> 14:39.640
Not everything. Not everyone.

14:54.559 --> 14:58.439
I wouldn't say
your thoughts were exactly pure.

14:58.439 --> 15:00.680
At least they're consistent.

15:00.680 --> 15:03.880
No agenda. No resentment.

15:10.879 --> 15:12.319
They pity me.

15:13.999 --> 15:15.560
You don't pity me.

15:15.560 --> 15:17.679
Why would I?

15:17.679 --> 15:20.719
What you're thinking now, that's
pretty graphic.

15:20.719 --> 15:26.520
That wasn't my thought. What?
I wasn't thinking anything,
that wasn't my thought.

15:26.520 --> 15:29.119
It must have been yours.

15:29.119 --> 15:32.399
That one! There! That's yours.

15:32.399 --> 15:36.879
Yeah, that was mine. I, um,

15:36.879 --> 15:38.880
certainly seem to be
enjoying myself.

15:38.880 --> 15:43.159
You would. You will.

16:00.800 --> 16:03.759
You have no ashtrays in
your whole house, not one.

16:03.759 --> 16:07.120
What are you using?
I think it's an egg cup.

16:13.679 --> 16:15.840
You OK?

16:15.840 --> 16:21.120
Freaking out a little?
Your birthday's July, right?

16:21.120 --> 16:22.999
You're the expert.

16:22.999 --> 16:26.080
Isn't it a little late to
still have your cards up?

16:26.080 --> 16:27.799
What? "Lots of love, Owen."

16:27.799 --> 16:30.639
I'm guessing that's Owen from work.

16:30.639 --> 16:33.639
Owen from the building
site yesterday morning.

16:33.639 --> 16:37.120
Owen from the photo on your fridge.
Put that down.

16:37.120 --> 16:39.040
All I'm saying is, I don't want
to get in the way of anything.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.280
There's nothing to
get in the way of.

16:43.680 --> 16:46.480
I see.

16:46.480 --> 16:50.479
You want to talk about it?
Not really. It's OK.

16:50.479 --> 16:53.719
Wouldn't be the first time
I'd been a rebound shag.

16:53.719 --> 16:55.519
You weren't, OK?

16:57.079 --> 16:58.920
Nothing's happened,

16:58.920 --> 17:01.039
nothing will ever happen.

17:01.039 --> 17:05.160
Just one of the delightful
things I found out,
thanks to your bloody pendant.

17:14.520 --> 17:16.480
It's not all bad,

17:16.480 --> 17:18.040
the pendant.

17:18.040 --> 17:20.839
Some of the things it
can do are extraordinary.

17:20.839 --> 17:22.920
What good could ever come of that?

17:22.920 --> 17:25.479
You need to work that out for
yourself.

17:30.440 --> 17:34.360
You need to go somewhere public,
somewhere crowded.

17:34.360 --> 17:36.880
What am I looking for?

17:36.880 --> 17:40.040
It will find you.

17:45.240 --> 17:47.240
I'm sick of these riddles.

17:47.240 --> 17:50.359
What's going on?
Where did you get this? I told you.

17:50.359 --> 17:53.480
Who are you, Mary?

17:53.480 --> 17:55.360
Is that even your real name?

17:55.360 --> 17:56.840
OK.

17:58.440 --> 18:00.160
Here's another name.

18:01.720 --> 18:03.360
Philoctetes.

18:03.360 --> 18:05.680
I'm Philoctetes.

18:16.480 --> 18:19.600
MULTIPLE VOICES

18:29.680 --> 18:35.080
'Bandage my hand, say I shut it
in the car door, that'll explain
why the signatures don't match.'

18:35.080 --> 18:37.240
'Gives me an hour before
Lisa gets back to dress up.

18:37.240 --> 18:39.040
'I've got to be careful.

18:39.040 --> 18:41.119
'She's started to notice her
tights are baggy at the crotch.'

18:41.119 --> 18:47.079
'All giggly, and I'm sat there with
my boobs like something out of the
National Geographic.

18:47.079 --> 18:51.840
'Six cigarettes today, and all of
them post-coital glorious.

18:55.680 --> 18:57.479
'Ah, Mr Bond,
I've been expecting you.

19:02.880 --> 19:05.960
'Some people should be
prohibited from wearing a thong.

19:05.960 --> 19:07.840
'What's that girl looking at?

19:07.840 --> 19:10.240
'I'm gonna kill them.

19:12.079 --> 19:13.879
'I'm gonna kill them.
I'm gonna kill them.

19:13.879 --> 19:18.120
'Lay their bodies out
afterwards, and lie next to them.

19:18.120 --> 19:21.240
'I'll have to do myself lying down.
I should have practised that.'

19:23.119 --> 19:23.959
Sorry.

19:23.959 --> 19:30.440
'I'll wear my glasses cos it makes
me look more sensitive.'

19:30.440 --> 19:35.959
'If Lawrence come in and finds us,
he'll know it's right, and what he's
been doing is trespassing.'

19:44.800 --> 19:47.359
'I won't miss anything.

19:47.359 --> 19:51.919
'I won't miss this city, miss
this body, I won't miss anything.'

20:04.200 --> 20:07.080
All right, Danny?

20:07.080 --> 20:08.920
I want him back at six.

20:08.920 --> 20:11.640
And I mean six this time.

20:11.640 --> 20:15.919
Kelly's given me 90 minutes
after-hours at the tanning
salon as a wedding present.

20:15.919 --> 20:17.839
Besides, you're breaking the
law bringing him home late.

20:17.839 --> 20:20.439
My dad reckons I could have
you arrested, so think on.

20:20.439 --> 20:23.880
Hey. Get your shoes on and go
to the toilet. What's that face?

20:23.880 --> 20:25.720
I don't wanna go. Well, you have to.

20:25.720 --> 20:29.239
Lawrence will be here in a minute,
and we're looking at napkins.

20:29.239 --> 20:31.999
It's boring.
Well, take your Space Invaders.

20:31.999 --> 20:35.200
Lawrence bought him that.
Don't hear a peep out of him now.

20:35.200 --> 20:39.079
Mind, that's Lawrence all over -
dead thoughtful. Not like some.

20:39.079 --> 20:42.240
Oh, and no cola. I don't want
him coming home all excited.

20:42.240 --> 20:45.840
Thought you'd stopped going fishing.
I have.

20:45.840 --> 20:48.679
Oh, my God, Neil,
what are you doing?!

20:48.679 --> 20:51.039
I was thinking of the Isle of Wight.
Do you remember?

20:51.039 --> 20:54.120
We had that chalet...around
when Danny was walking,

20:54.120 --> 21:01.279
and the chalet was just full of
spiders and you called me your hero,

21:01.279 --> 21:04.399
because I wasn't scared - I'd just
pick them up and throw them out.

21:04.399 --> 21:07.279
Oh, my God, Neil!

21:07.279 --> 21:10.560
No, you're scaring me! And it
was this perfect little memory.

21:10.560 --> 21:13.840
We were happy because
we were together.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.600
And all this nonsense
with Lawrence, it's fine,

21:16.600 --> 21:18.440
I forgive you.

21:18.440 --> 21:20.799
Because I'm looking at
the bigger picture now.

21:20.799 --> 21:22.480
Oh, my God!

21:22.480 --> 21:24.439
Oh, Christ! Oh, no, don't! Please!

21:24.439 --> 21:26.919
It's OK, it's just like
falling asleep. Really.

21:26.919 --> 21:29.719
Don't do this, to Danny, please!

21:29.719 --> 21:32.399
And then we will
be together forever.

21:37.800 --> 21:41.200
It's OK. You're OK now.

21:48.120 --> 21:49.800
Plodders.

21:49.800 --> 21:51.439
# The leg bone's connected
to the hip bone... #

21:51.439 --> 21:54.559
Please stop singing.
Anything to stop you singing!

21:54.559 --> 21:56.719
I don't know what
you're laughing at!

21:56.719 --> 21:59.599
Stop singing, please don't
sing, please don't sing.

22:02.799 --> 22:04.960
What's going on?

22:04.960 --> 22:07.999
You know the skeleton we
found at the site?

22:07.999 --> 22:12.760
Well, Amanda Burton here has just
completed the post-mortem.
OK, I can explain.

22:12.760 --> 22:18.199
As you may remember, at the building
site, Owen said this was a woman
killed by a single gunshot.

22:18.199 --> 22:23.520
I'd been there, like, a minute?
Since then he's had to tweak
some of his initial conclusions.

22:23.520 --> 22:26.639
The first being that this isn't, in
fact, a woman, but a man.

22:26.639 --> 22:29.999
A young man. A very girly man.

22:29.999 --> 22:33.240
But still ultimately a man.

22:33.240 --> 22:35.599
Then there was the cause of death.

22:35.599 --> 22:39.240
Owen said GSW. Uh-UHH!
The correct answer was...

22:39.240 --> 22:42.799
Unidentified trauma.
But... Unidentified trauma?

22:42.799 --> 22:49.640
You see it in RTAs, when something
like a steering column or a post goes
into a body at great velocity.

22:49.640 --> 22:53.160
But the one thing that could be
ruled out was... Gunshot wound.

22:53.160 --> 22:55.119
Gunshot wound.

22:55.119 --> 22:59.240
Was there, in fact, any part of
your prognosis that was right?

22:59.240 --> 23:01.720
I got that it was a...skeleton.

23:01.720 --> 23:06.640
Yes, you did.
You've just passed the point of...

23:06.640 --> 23:09.199
Where did you train? Where did
you train? DID you train?

23:14.120 --> 23:17.039
Jack, um, do you know
anything about Greek mythology?

23:17.039 --> 23:19.800
Security visa 45895.

23:19.800 --> 23:22.119
Harkness. A little, why?

23:22.119 --> 23:25.879
You ever heard of Philoctetes?
It came up in a pub quiz.

23:25.879 --> 23:27.840
You went to a pub quiz?

23:27.840 --> 23:29.959
Yeah. No, I love pub quizzes.

23:29.959 --> 23:33.439
Down at the Prince of...Tides.

23:33.439 --> 23:36.559
Philoctetes was an archer recruited
to fight in the Trojan War.

23:36.559 --> 23:40.920
He got into an argument and was
marooned on the island of Lemnos for
about ten years. Just left there?

23:43.800 --> 23:46.840
Hey! What's happening
with that list for UNIT?

23:46.840 --> 23:48.360
Hmm?

23:48.360 --> 23:50.600
Oh, yeah. I'm still working on it.

23:50.600 --> 23:54.600
Right.
Well, you know, when you're ready...

23:54.600 --> 23:57.400
Prime Minister, is
this a secure line?

23:57.400 --> 24:00.079
Can you tell me why Torchwood
operations have become part

24:00.079 --> 24:04.039
of your security briefings
to the leader of the Opposition?

24:06.840 --> 24:08.640
This is incredible.

24:08.640 --> 24:11.479
This is THE most incredible
thing I ever heard. They should
make an action figure of you.

24:11.479 --> 24:15.040
You were right, about the pendant.

24:15.040 --> 24:17.120
I see it now -
it can be used for good.

24:17.120 --> 24:20.040
What did they say at work?
How did you explain it?

24:20.040 --> 24:21.640
I didn't tell them.

24:21.640 --> 24:25.039
I think that's wise.

24:25.039 --> 24:27.759
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna
have to kiss you now.

24:27.759 --> 24:29.959
Mary, no. Listen!

24:29.959 --> 24:34.319
You do something
unbelievably brave and sexy,
I have to kiss you.

24:34.319 --> 24:36.640
I don't make the rules.

24:51.199 --> 24:53.999
So...

24:53.999 --> 24:57.240
What's happening with the thing
you found on the building site?

24:57.240 --> 24:59.119
Don't know, my boss
is dealing with that.

24:59.119 --> 25:00.960
I thought you did all
the technological stuff.

25:00.960 --> 25:04.160
I do, but sometimes
our jobs overlap a bit.

25:04.160 --> 25:07.080
I'm doing... There's an admin
thing he's asked me to do.

25:07.080 --> 25:09.800
Don't you have a secretary for that?

25:09.800 --> 25:12.519
It's actually quite complicated.

25:12.519 --> 25:14.319
So, what's he found out?

25:14.319 --> 25:18.360
I don't know. He's not said
anything. That's kind of strange.

25:18.360 --> 25:23.559
It isn't, it's fine. No, sure.
I mean, if he's keeping stuff from
you, there's bound to be a reason.

25:41.440 --> 25:45.400
You're not still worrying
about that, are you?

25:45.400 --> 25:49.640
OK, so I'm thinking if it isn't
a gunshot or a musket shot,

25:49.640 --> 25:51.799
or whatever they had then,

25:51.799 --> 25:53.760
maybe it was some kind of ritual.

25:53.760 --> 25:56.399
You are gorgeous!

25:56.399 --> 26:00.879
I start looking into devil-worship
and stuff from that era,

26:00.879 --> 26:05.440
see if there's anything
about plucking out hearts, and would
you believe it? There's nothing.

26:05.440 --> 26:09.760
They ate eyeballs, they drank
blood, they had sex with animals,

26:09.760 --> 26:14.359
but they did not pluck out
each other's hearts. Cos obviously
that would have been weird(!)

26:14.359 --> 26:20.359
Why are you so bothered?
Whoever did this is hardly a threat
to society any more. Yeah, I know.

26:20.359 --> 26:23.479
It's just, there's something...

26:23.479 --> 26:25.400
Does that remind you of anything?

26:25.400 --> 26:27.399
Um..

26:27.399 --> 26:30.640
That bit in Alien where that
thing bursts out of John Hurt?

26:30.640 --> 26:32.760
I'm sorry - I should
have been more specific.

26:32.760 --> 26:36.040
Does that remind
you of anything helpful?

26:36.040 --> 26:37.840
No. Sorry. Right.

26:37.840 --> 26:41.640
Erm, just go over there,
do your computer stuff and
think about shoes, eh?

26:41.640 --> 26:43.120
Thank you.

26:47.239 --> 26:51.199
Has Jack said anything to
you about the hardware we
found with the skeleton?

26:51.199 --> 26:53.920
No, why?

26:58.280 --> 27:01.120
'Check there were
any hospitals nearby.

27:01.120 --> 27:04.520
'Could have been someone died in an
operation. This has sugar in it.'

27:04.520 --> 27:07.119
No worries. Just asking.

27:07.119 --> 27:10.080
Hello. 'Keep looking at the
skeleton, don't look at her.'

27:10.080 --> 27:15.360
'You're grinning...' Hey, Tosh. That
coffee going begging? 'What's the
matter? Why isn't he looking at me?'

27:15.360 --> 27:19.360
There's copies of that Michael
Hamilton statement on your desk.

27:19.360 --> 27:22.720
He's still seeing Cybermen
outside his mother's house.

27:22.720 --> 27:26.479
'Don't think about her palm
on the bottom of my spine,
her hand in my hair.'

27:26.479 --> 27:29.239
I think I'll just go over there.

27:29.239 --> 27:34.200
OK. I'll phone Social Services,
see if there's a history of mental
illness. 'No, Gwen, this is good.

27:34.200 --> 27:38.959
'It can't go on. This is a good
thing. Why the hell isn't he looking
at me?' I think my desk is on fire.

27:52.519 --> 27:55.759
So I've just come from a really
interesting conversation

27:55.759 --> 28:00.120
with a Detective Inspector
Henderson. Right.

28:00.120 --> 28:03.559
Interesting because, firstly,

28:03.559 --> 28:06.959
the man had the biggest
hands I've ever seen,

28:06.959 --> 28:09.600
and secondly...

28:09.600 --> 28:13.560
because of the story he told me
about you saving a woman and her kid

28:13.560 --> 28:15.840
from being murdered
by her ex-husband.

28:15.840 --> 28:19.080
Yeah, no, I was going to tell
you about that. So why didn't you?

28:19.080 --> 28:23.279
I don't know, it wasn't a work
thing, just a...thing thing.

28:23.279 --> 28:28.320
Stuff happens all the time
that's not pertinent to here.
You do this all the time?

28:28.320 --> 28:31.879
So you secretly fight crime,
is that it, Tosh?

28:31.879 --> 28:36.120
I didn't want it
to look like I was showing off.

28:36.120 --> 28:39.560
The guy they arrested, Henderson,
said you heard him muttering

28:39.560 --> 28:43.000
to himself as he was walking along,
and that's what tipped you off.

28:43.000 --> 28:47.719
Mm. I couldn't really work out
what he was saying at first,
and then it was like, "Jesus!"

28:47.719 --> 28:51.759
That's weird because when
I'm about to murder someone,

28:51.759 --> 28:55.639
I'm careful not to talk to myself
about it while I'm in the street.

28:55.639 --> 28:59.080
No, sure. I mean, that's lesson one.

29:00.719 --> 29:03.919
I was wondering how you
were getting on with this.

29:03.919 --> 29:05.839
It's ongoing.

29:05.839 --> 29:08.559
Are you going to dismantle it?

29:08.559 --> 29:11.160
Like I said, it's ongoing.

29:21.320 --> 29:24.680
What? Have I got something
on my face? Is it food?

29:27.080 --> 29:29.440
No. Sorry.

29:29.440 --> 29:34.240
I zoned out. Well, listen, that
was a good save, Tosh. Well done.

29:47.119 --> 29:50.680
OK, so I've got crisps, I've got
coffee - real coffee - wine...

29:50.680 --> 29:53.440
I'm giving them the pendant.

29:53.440 --> 29:55.480
Right, let's... You're right,

29:55.480 --> 29:57.839
it's not like
reading someone's diary.

29:57.839 --> 30:03.480
It's so much worse, and it makes me
feel dirty and ashamed...

30:03.480 --> 30:06.080
And now,
I've been spying on my friends.

30:06.080 --> 30:10.480
Some friends. What's that supposed
to mean? They pity you,

30:10.480 --> 30:13.560
they exclude you!
They've got you doing bloody admin!

30:13.560 --> 30:18.599
So? No. I've made up my mind.
Toshiko, don't do this.

30:18.599 --> 30:20.960
So they'll probably want to
talk to you - why do you care?

30:20.960 --> 30:23.680
It's the pendant they're interested
in, they don't care about you.

30:23.680 --> 30:27.439
I go in that place,
I won't come out again.
What are you talking about?

30:27.439 --> 30:32.160
They're not the Stasi.
Look, I'll get my boss to come here.

30:32.160 --> 30:35.279
DISTORTED: Put the phone down.

30:35.279 --> 30:36.760
OK.

30:38.639 --> 30:40.079
I'll show you.

31:01.960 --> 31:03.960
This is why you can't tell them.

31:17.040 --> 31:18.720
You're cold.

31:18.720 --> 31:20.480
Who are you?

31:20.480 --> 31:22.680
Still the person you kissed.

31:22.680 --> 31:24.760
The person you caressed.

31:45.480 --> 31:48.719
Say something. So...

31:48.719 --> 31:50.600
I'm shagging a woman and an alien.

31:50.600 --> 31:53.519
Which is worse? Well, I know
which one my parents would say.

31:55.159 --> 31:59.359
I read your thoughts.
I didn't see this.

31:59.359 --> 32:03.720
What else are you keeping from me?
You think there could be
anything bigger than this?

32:03.720 --> 32:06.079
The freedom you have.

32:06.079 --> 32:12.680
When I first got here, I found it
almost obscene. My world was savage.

32:12.680 --> 32:17.999
Enforced worship in temples
the size of cities,
execution squads roaming the streets.

32:17.999 --> 32:19.919
Dissent of any kind meant death...

32:19.919 --> 32:23.680
or transportation,
to what they'd call a feral outpost.

32:23.680 --> 32:27.640
And the pendant?
It's how my people communicate.

32:27.640 --> 32:31.680
It's how we've
communicated for centuries.

32:31.680 --> 32:34.039
Speaking orally,

32:34.039 --> 32:38.919
using a pre-arranged and finite
number of words, it's so archaic.

32:38.919 --> 32:40.680
And kind of gross to look at.

32:49.080 --> 32:52.559
The machine you found
is a transporter.

32:52.559 --> 32:55.639
It brought me here, it can
get me home again. I need it
back before you dismantle it.

32:55.639 --> 32:59.720
But won't you be in danger?
200 years have passed.

32:59.720 --> 33:01.519
There'll be a new government.

33:01.519 --> 33:03.879
There'll have been 20 new governments
by now.

33:03.879 --> 33:08.199
Then why hasn't someone come back
for you? I've been forgotten.

33:09.799 --> 33:13.039
Like Philoctetes on Lemnos.

33:13.039 --> 33:16.720
Let me take you to Torchwood.
Maybe we can help you,

33:16.720 --> 33:20.520
fix the transporter,
get you back home. You won't!

33:20.520 --> 33:26.799
You'll examine me, assess whether
or not I'm useful, whether I'm
a danger, then lock me in a cell.

33:26.799 --> 33:30.840
You're not interested in
understanding alien cultures.

33:30.840 --> 33:36.200
It's just as well you haven't
got the technology to
reach other planets yet.

33:36.200 --> 33:38.520
Yours is a culture of invasion.

33:38.520 --> 33:41.039
Do you really think
I'm going to walk,

33:41.039 --> 33:43.600
hands raised in surrender, into that?

33:47.640 --> 33:51.919
'Silence when the door opens. Can't
do another night of the silence...'

33:51.919 --> 33:53.719
'His hands were cold.

33:53.719 --> 33:57.199
'Giving it all, "We'll call Social
Services," over a few bruises?!'

33:57.199 --> 34:02.400
'The whole inheritance is going
on sheltered accommodation...

34:04.720 --> 34:08.080
'Calling it
Grandad's little secret...'

34:53.760 --> 34:56.800
'I can't stand it any more.

34:56.800 --> 34:59.680
'The weight of it. The depravity.'

35:01.359 --> 35:03.599
The fear... It fills me up.

35:11.040 --> 35:13.760
It's in my mouth,

35:13.760 --> 35:15.799
and my hair,

35:15.799 --> 35:22.039
and my eyes. Marmer...

35:24.479 --> 35:27.360
Like I'm drowning in ink.

35:27.360 --> 35:29.160
What am I doing...?

35:29.160 --> 35:31.680
"Heart removed.

35:31.680 --> 35:36.480
"Records and post-mortem passed to
Operation Lowry." Operation Lowry...

35:41.279 --> 35:44.360
And even when I don't
have the pendant on,

35:44.360 --> 35:49.879
even when there's nothing, I can't
forget the things I've seen, the
things I've heard.

35:53.480 --> 35:56.800
Heart removed.

35:56.800 --> 35:58.760
Heart removed. Removed...

36:02.280 --> 36:03.879
How far back does it go?

36:03.879 --> 36:06.240
It's like a curse,

36:06.240 --> 36:10.119
something the gods send
to drive someone mad.

36:10.119 --> 36:13.039
I had hope.

36:13.039 --> 36:17.599
I'd see something,
some little random act of kindness,

36:17.599 --> 36:21.959
and it made me think we were safe,
there was some essential good in us.

36:21.959 --> 36:25.280
This is impossible. But there isn't.

36:25.280 --> 36:27.040
It's like one of the weevils.

36:27.040 --> 36:30.480
You look inside, and there's
just this great yawning scream.

36:35.160 --> 36:37.840
This is completely impossible.

36:39.359 --> 36:42.520
You were right.
Everything you said about us.

36:42.520 --> 36:47.760
We're frightened and
we're callous.
Owen. You need to see this.

36:49.560 --> 36:55.039
And I can't be part of it
any longer. I don't know what to do.

36:55.039 --> 36:58.320
Tell me what to do!
Get me into Torchwood.

37:12.919 --> 37:17.240
"In Xanadu, did Kublai Khan
a stately pleasure-dome decree...

37:17.240 --> 37:20.000
"Where Alph the sacred river ran
through caverns measureless to man,

37:21.919 --> 37:23.839
"down to a sunless sea."

37:25.600 --> 37:28.920
So, where is it, lover? Stay here.

37:28.920 --> 37:31.960
Jack, my boss, has got it.

37:31.960 --> 37:34.799
Be quick.

37:34.799 --> 37:37.640
I've a long journey ahead of me.

37:37.640 --> 37:42.400
I might need something to eat before
I go. This what you're looking for?

37:42.400 --> 37:45.159
Jack! Friend of mine -

37:45.159 --> 37:46.919
let's call him Vincent.

37:46.919 --> 37:53.239
That was his name, after all.
Regular guy, girlfriend,
likes his sport, likes a beer.

37:53.239 --> 37:57.199
He starts acting a little...strange,

37:57.199 --> 37:59.599
a little distracted.

37:59.599 --> 38:04.120
Suddenly he disappears
for a couple of months.

38:04.120 --> 38:06.000
He comes back,

38:06.000 --> 38:08.640
and we've gotta start
calling him Vanessa.

38:08.640 --> 38:12.280
Since then I've always been
a little nervous when a
friend behaves out of character.

38:12.280 --> 38:17.120
I'm sorry,
we haven't been introduced.

38:17.120 --> 38:19.279
Jack Harkness.

38:19.279 --> 38:23.640
My guess is you're not from
around these parts. Now this...

38:25.399 --> 38:31.960
This is incredible. You
know what it is? It's a transporter.

38:31.960 --> 38:36.919
Mary was a political prisoner -
she was exiled here. Look, Jack...

38:36.919 --> 38:39.840
You've got half of it right.
Mary... It is Mary, isn't it?

38:39.840 --> 38:45.600
You want to tell her the
really interesting bit? No?

38:45.600 --> 38:49.999
Chatty, isn't she? I don't know how
you got a word in edgeways, Tosh.

38:49.999 --> 38:53.440
It's a two-man transporter.
Or whatever you people may be.

38:53.440 --> 38:55.320
You might be squids, for all I know.

38:55.320 --> 38:57.520
A two-squid transporter.

38:57.520 --> 39:02.320
Room for one prisoner and one guard.
You want to tell us what
happened to the guard, Mary?

39:02.320 --> 39:03.880
I killed him.

39:03.880 --> 39:05.760
But I was disturbed.

39:50.759 --> 39:52.839
Then another came - a soldier.

39:52.839 --> 39:56.160
He tried to shoot me.

40:02.479 --> 40:05.199
Do whores have prayers?

40:05.199 --> 40:11.760
So I plunged my new human hand into
his chest and plucked out his heart.

40:16.360 --> 40:18.479
And that's what you've
been doing ever since.

40:18.479 --> 40:23.800
This form needs to be fed. All the
punctures were all about the size of
a fist. My God, all those people.

40:23.800 --> 40:25.920
You killed all those people.

40:25.920 --> 40:28.039
I fled before any more soldiers came.

40:28.039 --> 40:31.000
I had so much to explore!

40:31.000 --> 40:33.679
And how I loved this body.

40:33.679 --> 40:35.800
So soft.

40:35.800 --> 40:39.480
So wicked. The power such
a body has in this world.

40:39.480 --> 40:43.520
Within a few years the forest had
gone, transporter was safely buried
under the spread of the city.

40:43.520 --> 40:47.200
I didn't care, I wasn't
exactly in a hurry to get home.

40:47.200 --> 40:52.000
And you've been killing ever since.
I knew there might come a time when
my situation here became complicated,

40:52.000 --> 40:55.599
but I was safe, as long as I
knew where the transporter was.

40:55.599 --> 40:58.999
'The way she looks at you with
those eyes - she's like an animal.'

40:58.999 --> 41:02.280
'When they brought that girl
into the hospital, I had only
been qualified six months.

41:02.280 --> 41:04.520
'I wanted to throw up.'
And then the machine was uncovered.

41:04.520 --> 41:08.320
As soon as the air touched
its surface, I could feel it.

41:08.320 --> 41:12.519
'She's just talking,
she's not even frightened of
us, she's just talking.'

41:12.519 --> 41:14.919
So I found my Toshiko.
My beautiful Toshiko.

41:14.919 --> 41:20.879
'Gonna go for it now.'
Owen, NO! Let her go, Mary!

41:20.879 --> 41:24.519
Let her go! Toshiko,
tell them to give me the transporter.
I can't, Mary.

41:24.519 --> 41:30.079
'It's ridiculous - we're unarmed,
we're just shouting at her.
Not again. Please, God, not again.'

41:30.079 --> 41:32.239
'Knife has incisors on the blade.
It'll tear Tosh's throat out.'

41:32.239 --> 41:34.840
How's this?
I'll exchange Toshiko for that one.

41:34.840 --> 41:38.080
Your choice. 'No, no, not Gwen.'

41:38.080 --> 41:41.080
Just put the knife down. Did you
hear him? He didn't want to, did he?

41:41.080 --> 41:44.800
'She read my thoughts,
she actually read my thoughts.'

41:44.800 --> 41:46.360
'What happened? What did he say?'

41:46.360 --> 41:48.920
Please, don't...
That's what they think of you.

41:48.920 --> 41:51.080
That's who you've been working
with for all these years.

41:51.080 --> 41:54.160
It's not true, Tosh, don't listen.

41:54.160 --> 41:58.519
But not me. Whatever I've done,
it doesn't change the way
I feel about you.

41:58.519 --> 42:01.640
We have a connection, Toshiko,
something real.

42:01.640 --> 42:05.719
'Toshiko... Don't move.

42:05.719 --> 42:07.560
'Don't do anything until I say.'

42:07.560 --> 42:11.119
OK, you want the transporter,
we want Toshiko.

42:11.119 --> 42:15.439
'I've been trained
for this hostage situation...

42:15.439 --> 42:17.119
'For God's sake, think!'

42:17.119 --> 42:19.400
I think that's a fair swap.
Keep the knife and I'll give
you the transporter myself.

42:19.400 --> 42:21.960
'He's just going to let her go.'

42:21.960 --> 42:23.479
It's a bluff,
but I think it's going to work.

42:30.720 --> 42:32.239
You smell...

42:35.079 --> 42:37.359
different to them. That's nothing.

42:37.359 --> 42:41.760
It's when you compare
teeth with a British guy,
that's when it's really scary.

42:41.760 --> 42:44.879
What are you? I don't know.

42:44.879 --> 42:47.080
And you would have put me in a cage?

42:49.279 --> 42:52.000
What's happening? Oh, that.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.640
I re-programmed it for you.
It's set to enable.

43:09.480 --> 43:12.439
Sort of now. What did she...?

43:12.439 --> 43:15.439
Has she gone home?
I reset the co-ordinates.

43:15.439 --> 43:17.199
Where to? To the centre of the sun.

43:17.199 --> 43:18.799
It shouldn't be hot.

43:18.799 --> 43:21.520
I mean, we sent her there at night
and everything. You killed her.

43:21.520 --> 43:23.560
Yes.

43:36.520 --> 43:40.359
Just ask her.
I will, but give me a bit of time.

43:40.359 --> 43:43.720
Say something to her. What do want
me to do? She's been through enough.

43:43.720 --> 43:47.400
It's really creeping me out.
All right!

43:47.400 --> 43:49.480
Owen, don't be selfish about this.

43:49.480 --> 43:51.160
All right!

43:51.160 --> 43:54.319
When did you have this...
I don't know...ability?

43:54.319 --> 43:56.640
Just a couple of days.
What did you hear?

43:56.640 --> 44:00.039
A lot of it was noise. Emotions.

44:00.039 --> 44:03.599
References I wouldn't understand.
Yeah, and the rest?

44:03.599 --> 44:07.919
The rest was none of my business.
No. It wasn't.

44:14.599 --> 44:18.600
I don't know where this leaves us.
Me neither.

44:18.600 --> 44:22.999
We can't really take the
moral high ground over this.

44:22.999 --> 44:25.519
This thing between me and Owen, it...

44:25.519 --> 44:27.600
No, Gwen.

44:27.600 --> 44:30.040
What I did was an invasion.

44:30.040 --> 44:35.079
I wasn't in control, I realise
that now. But even so, I can't...

44:36.160 --> 44:38.640
I have to live with this.

44:38.640 --> 44:41.119
Not what I heard,
but what I did to you.

44:41.119 --> 44:47.400
And my betrayal? What do you mean?
I'm living with mine.

44:49.679 --> 44:55.039
This should be my wake-up call.
I should stop. But I won't.
What does that say about me?

44:55.039 --> 44:58.560
I'm not really in a
position to make judgements.
This is what I'm saying, Tosh.

44:58.560 --> 45:00.999
Neither am I.

45:03.159 --> 45:05.799
Don't let this...

45:05.799 --> 45:09.159
It doesn't matter. Sorry, forget it.
What?

45:09.159 --> 45:14.600
Don't let this put you off.
The last couple of days,
you've had a look about you.

45:14.600 --> 45:17.560
Love suited you.

45:28.840 --> 45:31.719
It's funny.

45:31.719 --> 45:33.479
Such a small thing.

45:33.479 --> 45:37.600
It could be the most powerful piece
of technology we've ever found.

45:40.920 --> 45:44.920
It could tear down governments,
wipe out armies.

45:48.919 --> 45:51.240
What do we do with it?

45:52.039 --> 45:53.999
Your call.

45:57.999 --> 46:00.319
It's a curse.

46:12.399 --> 46:14.400
Why couldn't I read your mind?

46:16.000 --> 46:18.360
I don't know.

46:18.360 --> 46:21.559
Though I could feel you
scrabbling around in there.

46:21.559 --> 46:24.280
I got nothing.

46:24.280 --> 46:26.040
It's like you were...

46:26.040 --> 46:28.159
I don't know...dead.

46:30.880 --> 46:36.039
I want that list for UNIT
on my desk tomorrow, or I'll...

46:36.039 --> 46:41.119
What do bosses do in
situations like these?

46:41.119 --> 46:44.160
Y'know, regular bosses.

46:44.160 --> 46:46.360
Can I get to beat people?

46:48.600 --> 46:51.399
We've got rules for that!

46:51.399 --> 46:52.839
Red tape.

46:55.439 --> 46:56.879
Jack...

46:59.200 --> 47:01.279
Something Mary said...

47:03.480 --> 47:07.399
Probably the only honest
thing she ever did say.

47:09.960 --> 47:12.760
I asked her why she gave it to me.

47:12.760 --> 47:16.399
And she said,
"After a while it gets to you.

47:17.160 --> 47:20.160
"It changes how you see people."

47:22.599 --> 47:24.960
How can I live with it?

47:24.960 --> 47:29.359
There are some things we're
not supposed to know.

47:29.359 --> 47:31.159
You got a snapshot -

47:33.159 --> 47:35.800
nothing more.

47:35.800 --> 47:41.280
I don't mean
about Gwen and Ianto and Owen.

47:41.280 --> 47:44.879
I mean... The whole world...

47:46.879 --> 47:48.999
It doesn't matter.

48:43.799 --> 48:46.840
Now these people are paying the
price, ripped apart

48:46.840 --> 48:49.159
with your name written
in their own blood.

48:49.159 --> 48:54.519
It brings people back to life.
We just question the murder victims.

48:54.519 --> 48:57.520
Uh-oh, we're in trouble.

48:57.520 --> 49:00.999
There's got to be a
link between the victims.

49:00.999 --> 49:03.600
Find the link, find the killer.

49:03.600 --> 49:06.759
