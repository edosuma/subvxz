WEBVTT

00:08.100 --> 00:10.011
Hey, man, where's this
relief waitress you hired?

00:10.314 --> 00:14.512
Oh, don't worry, Sam, she's a great
waitress, a complete professional.

00:14.909 --> 00:16.228
Well, how come she's not here?

00:16.496 --> 00:19.294
Well, she called and said
she'd be about 20 minutes late.

00:19.629 --> 00:22.268
She wants to get in
all her breaks before she starts.

00:26.479 --> 00:29.835
Oh, there she is.
Hey, Corinne, over here.

00:31.575 --> 00:32.928
When you asked them
for a waitress,

00:33.162 --> 00:36.234
did you tell them this was a bar,
not a truck stop?

00:37.548 --> 00:39.300
Hi, honey. Is this it?

00:39.595 --> 00:42.985
Yep, Corinne, this is my boss,
Sam Malone.

00:43.313 --> 00:46.191
Hi, honey. Just give me
some checks and we're all set.

00:47.114 --> 00:49.070
Okay, Woody, why don't you
show her where they are?

00:49.328 --> 00:50.807
It's right down here.

00:51.792 --> 00:54.101
Would you look
at the size of this place?

00:54.424 --> 00:57.302
My dogs'll be barking tonight.

00:59.938 --> 01:02.816
Pardon me, am I mistaken, or did you
used to work at the Hungry Heifer?

01:03.154 --> 01:05.065
- Sure, I worked there.
- Yeah?

01:05.367 --> 01:08.599
Say, I know you. The girls there
had a pet name for you.

01:08.960 --> 01:13.158
- What was that?
- That guy who comes back.

01:15.309 --> 01:16.742
Hey, listen, thanks for helping out.

01:16.980 --> 01:18.459
From now on
let me pick the waitresses.

01:18.693 --> 01:21.412
My customers are used to something
with a little more sex appeal.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.630
Sam. Where'd you get the fox?

01:31.000 --> 01:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:45.500 --> 02:48.094
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

02:48.422 --> 02:52.779
- How's life in the fast lane, Normie?
- Beats me. I can't find the on-ramp.

02:53.307 --> 02:56.299
Hey, hey, your brow is
a little furrowed there, my friend.

02:56.605 --> 02:58.038
What's the boney, Maroney?

02:58.275 --> 03:01.472
Well, Vera's getting the urge
to go on vacation again.

03:02.784 --> 03:05.059
Don't worry. It'll pass.
Happens every year.

03:05.331 --> 03:09.643
I think she's serious this time.
Maps have been unfolded.

03:10.048 --> 03:12.801
- Where does she wanna go?
- The tropics.

03:13.179 --> 03:16.137
Says she wants to lay in the sand
and bake in the sun.

03:16.477 --> 03:17.466
I offered a compromise.

03:17.688 --> 03:22.284
I said, just turn up the radiator
and stick your feet in the cat box.

03:23.199 --> 03:25.952
- And she didn't go for that?
- No, no. It's my own damn fault.

03:26.247 --> 03:27.999
You know,
I think I've spoiled that woman.

03:30.087 --> 03:33.966
Mr Peterson, if you want
the vacation of a lifetime,

03:34.304 --> 03:36.977
without spending a fortune,
I have one word for you:

03:37.310 --> 03:40.541
- Yeah?
- Hanover, lndiana.

03:40.900 --> 03:44.449
All right. Well, what would I do for
excitement in, say, Hanover, lndiana?

03:44.825 --> 03:47.737
Well, if you leave right away,
you can catch the Corn Parade.

03:48.039 --> 03:49.757
Now, that's kind of like
the Rose Parade.

03:50.001 --> 03:51.798
But instead of using flowers
for the floats--

03:52.089 --> 03:54.444
- They use corn.
- You've heard of it.

03:57.474 --> 03:58.873
Well, hold on a second.

03:59.103 --> 04:00.934
- Carla, it's for you.
- Who is it?

04:01.232 --> 04:02.870
I don't know.
It's one of your daughters.

04:03.152 --> 04:05.063
- Which one?
- I couldn't tell.

04:05.323 --> 04:08.918
- It sounded like, "Humanity."
- Oh, it's Anne Marie.

04:09.247 --> 04:13.126
She's wearing a retainer on her teeth,
and she's feeling a little insecure.

04:14.550 --> 04:16.461
Anne Marie?

04:16.762 --> 04:19.798
No, I didn't know it was you
from your ugly voice.

04:20.853 --> 04:24.290
Hon, no. Anne Marie,
people are not gonna make fun of you

04:24.611 --> 04:27.250
every time you open your mouth.

04:27.575 --> 04:30.726
Honey, your family are not people.

04:31.040 --> 04:32.359
Yeah, right, goodbye.

04:35.173 --> 04:37.209
Poor kid.

04:37.511 --> 04:39.342
I remember when I was
at that awkward age.

04:39.599 --> 04:42.272
Any little difference between me
and the other children

04:42.604 --> 04:47.200
and I was embarrassed and humiliated
in front of what felt like the world.

04:48.282 --> 04:52.798
- Hi, Diane.
- And on it goes.

04:55.714 --> 04:57.466
You left your sweater
at my apartment.

04:57.759 --> 05:01.593
Oh, thank you, Dennis.

05:03.020 --> 05:07.536
And thanks for bringing it by
in this all-too-brief visit.

05:08.071 --> 05:11.746
- Why are you dressed like that?
- I'm working the Renaissance Faire.

05:12.079 --> 05:14.035
Don't they have
dressing rooms there?

05:14.292 --> 05:17.807
I thought you'd get a kick out of it.
You said it was your favourite era.

05:18.132 --> 05:20.043
Dennis, there's a time and place
for everything.

05:20.303 --> 05:23.375
And the time for this
was the 14th century.

05:25.355 --> 05:29.951
I'm sorry.
So are we still on for Saturday night?

05:31.116 --> 05:33.425
Next Saturday would be impossible.

05:33.746 --> 05:35.623
You don't wanna
go out with me again, do you?

05:35.876 --> 05:38.185
I didn't say that, Dennis.
You're putting words in my mouth.

05:38.464 --> 05:39.897
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

05:40.134 --> 05:42.602
No, no, they're the right words.

05:45.311 --> 05:47.825
I'll give you a call, Dennis.

05:52.700 --> 05:56.488
All right. I know what's coming.
Let's get on with it.

05:56.875 --> 05:59.947
- What? What are you talking about?
- You know. Dennis.

06:00.298 --> 06:02.050
He didn't, well...

06:02.845 --> 06:06.599
- He didn't look very ordinary.
- Oh, nonsense.

06:06.936 --> 06:08.164
I thought he looked great.

06:08.398 --> 06:11.834
Especially if he was gonna
spend the day in Sherwood Forest.

06:13.908 --> 06:17.139
You're not being very fair.
Dennis is a really special guy.

06:17.499 --> 06:20.059
Yeah, and I sensed that, Diane.
I said to myself--

06:20.379 --> 06:24.213
As soon as he walked in, I said,
now there's a sissy with a dream.

06:28.145 --> 06:30.818
Dennis Kaufman
is a brilliant puppeteer.

06:31.151 --> 06:32.709
He does a wonderful
Punch and Judy.

06:32.987 --> 06:36.536
He'd better have a wonderful punch
if he's gonna dress like Judy.

06:38.331 --> 06:39.844
Oh, you really pick them, Diane.

06:40.085 --> 06:42.235
Next to him,
even Frasier looks like Rambo.

06:47.975 --> 06:50.773
Look what I've stooped to.
Dennis is a fine human being,

06:51.065 --> 06:53.579
and I hustled him out of here
like he had the plague.

06:53.903 --> 06:57.578
All in an effort
to avoid your childish gibes.

06:58.496 --> 07:00.054
How will I ever make it up to him?

07:00.333 --> 07:03.245
Well, you could always
offer to set his hair.

07:04.424 --> 07:07.541
Fine, fine. Thank you all.

07:07.889 --> 07:10.642
Oh, come on. You're overreacting.

07:10.979 --> 07:13.732
We were simply indulging in a couple
of yuks. Were we not, guys?

07:14.736 --> 07:16.692
Well, I can understand
why you act like this,

07:16.949 --> 07:19.782
and Sam stooping to such
puerile behaviour.

07:20.080 --> 07:24.039
You're jealous. But I don't know
why everyone else jumps in.

07:24.422 --> 07:27.619
Now, Woody here was the
only one of you mature enough

07:27.970 --> 07:31.963
to refrain from jumping on
your mudslinging bandwagon.

07:32.354 --> 07:34.663
Well, why should l, Miss Chambers?
I liked Denise.

07:34.942 --> 07:37.376
- No, that's Dennis.
- I know.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.321
Hey, Normie?

07:51.683 --> 07:54.151
You feel like doing something
adventurous tonight?

07:54.481 --> 07:57.075
I'm already doing that, Cliffie.

07:58.196 --> 08:00.471
Vera's trying on a new
facial mask this evening,

08:00.785 --> 08:04.573
and I kind of wanna rush home
and watch it crack.

08:05.753 --> 08:09.587
- All right.
- Why? What did you have in mind?

08:09.969 --> 08:12.802
Well, I heard from one of the guys
down in the junk-mail room

08:13.100 --> 08:17.491
that there's a new act down at
the old Wham Bam Room.

08:17.901 --> 08:19.812
Oh, hot dog.

08:20.114 --> 08:22.992
Presenting the finest
in nudie entertainment.

08:23.287 --> 08:24.561
Come on, Fras, what do you say?
Let's go.

08:24.832 --> 08:27.187
Oh, you're inviting me along
to this evening of devilment?

08:27.504 --> 08:30.223
- You got a credit card, don't you?
- There you go.

08:30.551 --> 08:34.429
You know, I'm not so sure if it really
fits in with my image, you know?

08:34.809 --> 08:37.244
A desperately lonely character
on the make?

08:38.357 --> 08:40.871
- Well, I guess I'm in.
- All right.

08:45.330 --> 08:48.686
Oh, sure.
Just when I'm about to have fun.

08:49.046 --> 08:51.321
- That's Mrs Benedict.
- How did you know that?

08:51.634 --> 08:53.704
Because she's the person
I'd least like to hear from.

08:53.972 --> 08:57.362
Even her beep is whiny.
Excuse me, just two seconds.

08:57.729 --> 09:00.368
Guys, Carla, get your coats.
You're coming over to my place.

09:00.694 --> 09:02.969
Tonight, on the tube,
The Magnificent Seven.

09:03.282 --> 09:05.557
Cliffie, the Wham Bam Room
will always be there,

09:05.829 --> 09:07.660
but only tonight will the Seven ride.

09:07.958 --> 09:10.188
Say no more.
Bronson, McQueen, Coburn.

09:11.006 --> 09:12.997
- Don't think I ever saw that one.
- You're kidding.

09:13.260 --> 09:14.739
Then tonight you become a man.

09:15.013 --> 09:17.652
- Well, I'm off.
- Hey, change of plans, Frasier.

09:17.978 --> 09:19.616
The Magnificent Seven,
Sammy's TV, tonight.

09:19.856 --> 09:24.372
The Seven? Great.
I never miss a Horst Buchholz film.

09:25.910 --> 09:28.140
Listen, l-- Tell you what.
I'll catch up to you

09:28.415 --> 09:30.770
just as soon as I talk Mrs Benedict
out of her hamper.

09:32.172 --> 09:33.844
You guys do this a lot?

09:34.134 --> 09:36.568
Well, yeah, every time
one of the classics is on TV,

09:36.848 --> 09:39.043
we all head over to Sammy's,
make some popcorn,

09:39.311 --> 09:40.630
and glue our eyeballs to the set.

09:40.897 --> 09:44.810
You know, I'm not ordinarily a fan
of American Westerns,

09:45.198 --> 09:48.634
but because The Magnificent Seven
is a remake of the far superior

09:48.955 --> 09:52.027
and more complex Japanese film,
The Seven Samurai,

09:52.337 --> 09:54.089
a comparison will be interesting.

09:54.382 --> 09:58.170
We'll be sure to do that. Now you don't
mind locking up, do you, sweetheart?

09:59.434 --> 10:02.187
Oh, of course not.

10:08.368 --> 10:10.928
We didn't hear anything.

10:11.249 --> 10:14.241
No, no, I'm gonna check this out.

10:19.139 --> 10:21.733
I'm sorry. You wanna come
with us, sweetheart?

10:22.061 --> 10:26.418
No. I don't wanna ruin your fun.

10:27.196 --> 10:30.950
When I first walked into this place,
I felt like an alien,

10:31.288 --> 10:35.122
and four years later,
I still feel like an alien.

10:35.504 --> 10:38.302
Well, if the antenna fits.

10:40.973 --> 10:42.122
Diane, wait a second.

10:42.393 --> 10:45.669
- I just wanna go home, Sam.
- Well, maybe if you...

10:51.536 --> 10:53.367
I don't know, guys.

10:54.500 --> 10:56.730
I don't feel good
about the movie tonight.

10:56.980 --> 10:58.652
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:36.640 --> 11:38.198
Cheers.

11:38.476 --> 11:43.675
Oh, hi, Diane. Why aren't you here?
Are you sick or something?

11:44.233 --> 11:47.066
Oh, well, you sound all stuffed up.

11:49.072 --> 11:54.021
Well, I hope you feel better.
Bye-bye.

11:55.246 --> 11:57.714
- What's the matter with her?
- She said she's got this allergy

11:58.041 --> 12:00.509
where you weep uncontrollably.

12:01.921 --> 12:03.912
What do you think?
Do you think we hurt her feelings

12:04.174 --> 12:06.130
a little bit too much last night?

12:06.426 --> 12:09.065
Hey, maybe we ought to
do something to make it up to her.

12:09.847 --> 12:15.080
- Like send her a bouquet of flowers.
- Oh, cliché city, huh?

12:15.479 --> 12:19.677
You know, whenever I break the heart
of a member of the gentler sex,

12:20.026 --> 12:24.338
I always send her a nice
box of dried figs.

12:25.658 --> 12:28.092
Figs won't do it.

12:28.912 --> 12:31.301
Let me see if I can explain this.

12:32.500 --> 12:36.778
Diane has always tried
to take part in your activities.

12:37.172 --> 12:40.050
Why don't you return the favour
by joining her

12:40.343 --> 12:43.972
in something she finds entertaining?

12:44.348 --> 12:50.059
Oh, boy. All right, what egghead
torture do we have to endure now?

12:50.522 --> 12:52.877
Well, how about the opera?

12:53.192 --> 12:55.228
- Oh, man, come on.
- Oh, gross.

12:55.528 --> 12:59.077
It's not like we threw her
down a flight of stairs. Come on.

12:59.450 --> 13:01.725
Tell you what. Leave it to me.

13:02.036 --> 13:04.675
I'll make all the arrangements,
right down to her favourite flowers.

13:04.998 --> 13:07.466
All you guys have to do
is just show up.

13:10.254 --> 13:13.212
All right, what do you say, guys?
I mean, it's the least we could do.

13:15.135 --> 13:17.205
- Well?
- All right, all right, all right.

13:17.513 --> 13:20.710
Do me a favour, just pick an opera
where it doesn't sound like

13:21.018 --> 13:24.294
somebody backing over a cat.
Please.

13:24.647 --> 13:25.682
We do happen to be in luck.

13:25.899 --> 13:28.971
You see, they're playing
Diane's favourite tomorrow night.

13:29.319 --> 13:31.628
Lucia di Lammermoor
by Donizetti.

13:31.906 --> 13:33.578
Yeah? Well, count me out.

13:33.867 --> 13:35.778
You know, every time we had
a family gathering,

13:36.036 --> 13:37.867
they always tried to get me
interested in opera.

13:38.122 --> 13:39.760
I just couldn't stand it.

13:40.041 --> 13:41.952
It's just a bunch
of fat, homely people

13:42.210 --> 13:45.998
screeching
and trying to stab each other.

13:47.091 --> 13:50.049
Well, Carla, you know,
not all operas are like that.

13:50.887 --> 13:53.447
I was talking about
the family gathering.

14:09.785 --> 14:14.063
Check it out, boys. Better than
the skyview seats at Fenway.

14:16.502 --> 14:19.858
Look at these chairs.
They're not even bolted down.

14:20.215 --> 14:21.887
Oh, hey, that's class for you.

14:22.134 --> 14:24.568
Boy, you gotta really hand it
to Frasier, don't you?

14:24.887 --> 14:28.118
He really knows what melts
Diane's butter. Look at this.

14:29.142 --> 14:31.292
All right, all right,
now if we stick together tonight,

14:31.562 --> 14:33.075
I think we won't have
any casualties.

14:33.356 --> 14:35.745
Hey, hey, just as long as you
remember your job there, Woody.

14:36.026 --> 14:39.018
Anybody starts falling asleep,
give them a nudge.

14:39.864 --> 14:43.539
Hey, don't worry, Mr Clavin.
There's no way I'm gonna fall asleep.

14:43.911 --> 14:47.426
I had a four-hour nap this afternoon,
drank 12 cups of coffee,

14:47.749 --> 14:49.979
and I'm wearing extra-tight shoes.

14:51.295 --> 14:53.684
- So where's Diane?
- Oh, she's powdering her nose.

14:53.964 --> 14:56.194
She started to cry again.
I mean, what a woman, huh?

14:56.468 --> 14:58.777
Do you believe that?
She started to cry when we told her

14:59.054 --> 15:02.091
we're gonna take her to the opera, she
cried when she saw us in our tuxes.

15:02.391 --> 15:04.382
And she cried
when she saw the limo.

15:04.686 --> 15:07.405
She's got it under control, though.
She said she won't do it anymore.

15:07.731 --> 15:10.689
No, thank you. I'll seat myself.

15:13.905 --> 15:16.180
Oh, this is the best box.

15:16.993 --> 15:19.712
- Now, you promised--
- I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

15:20.038 --> 15:22.677
Madame, your seat.

15:22.958 --> 15:25.188
No, no. Come on, yeah, that's good.

15:27.213 --> 15:28.931
Gentlemen.

15:35.849 --> 15:37.567
What a glorious night.

15:37.851 --> 15:41.446
Somebody pinch me.
That's just an expression, Cliff.

15:44.276 --> 15:48.110
On second thought, don't pinch me.
If this is a dream,

15:48.448 --> 15:49.642
I do not want to awaken.

15:51.410 --> 15:54.004
Listen, I know that you're all
novices to the opera,

15:54.330 --> 15:56.400
so I'd like to give you
a little background.

15:57.208 --> 15:59.642
Tonight's performance is in ltalian.

15:59.962 --> 16:03.921
I'm sure that you will find it
both enlightening and entertaining.

16:04.300 --> 16:06.336
Oh, by the way,
does anyone need opera glasses?

16:06.637 --> 16:11.074
Oh, no, no. I brought
a pair of my own there, Diane.

16:18.860 --> 16:22.091
Cliffie, think those are
powerful enough, pal?

16:23.073 --> 16:26.986
You better believe it, Norm. Get a load
of the warheads on that cellist.

16:28.413 --> 16:31.086
No, hey, hey, hey.
Don't, don't, don't.

16:31.375 --> 16:35.163
So this charming piece
is in three acts.

16:35.547 --> 16:39.540
It begins with
Edgardo leaving for France

16:39.886 --> 16:43.083
to renew his vow of love for Lucia.

16:43.432 --> 16:48.347
Though both houses
have maintained a feud for years.

16:49.439 --> 16:52.875
Enrico, Lucia's brother,
arranges a marriage

16:53.193 --> 16:55.388
between his friend Arturo and Lucia

16:55.697 --> 16:59.815
by tricking her into believing
that Edgardo has been untrue.

17:03.331 --> 17:05.321
But let's watch.

17:06.710 --> 17:08.462
The maestro.

18:01.819 --> 18:03.889
Wasn't that lovely?

18:12.832 --> 18:15.107
Good night. Good night.

18:15.544 --> 18:16.533
So how'd it go?

18:16.754 --> 18:19.348
Well, I had a problem
with one of the customers.

18:19.674 --> 18:22.825
- Oh, yeah, what?
- He refused to keep his hands on me.

18:25.890 --> 18:27.482
- Go home. I'll finish up here.
- Thanks.

18:27.726 --> 18:28.954
Yeah.

18:29.728 --> 18:33.403
Diane, you probably noticed
I wasn't there tonight.

18:34.317 --> 18:37.195
Oh, yes. Thank you, Carla.

18:39.115 --> 18:43.108
- It was a really sweet gesture.
- You're welcome.

18:44.413 --> 18:49.726
- May I offer you a cognac?
- Yes, that would be lovely.

18:51.713 --> 18:54.386
Thank you again, Sam,
for your thoughtfulness.

18:54.717 --> 18:59.154
It may not seem like much to you,
but it really meant a lot to me.

18:59.556 --> 19:02.946
No, no, it seemed like
quite a bit to us too.

19:07.107 --> 19:09.905
This evening was so special,
so wonderful to me.

19:10.236 --> 19:11.794
And it was all your doing.

19:13.240 --> 19:15.879
Well, there were
some other people involved.

19:16.160 --> 19:19.709
Oh, no, you're their leader.
They do nothing without you.

19:20.040 --> 19:22.713
- Well...
- But so gallant.

19:23.002 --> 19:27.075
Well, thank you.
I can't help helping, I guess.

19:29.843 --> 19:33.916
Every detail was so well-thought-out,
right down to your choice of opera.

19:34.307 --> 19:38.459
Oh, well, I knew that
Lucy...was your favourite.

19:41.107 --> 19:44.497
It was perfect.
You hit all the right chords.

19:44.862 --> 19:48.252
Well, I think I know you
pretty well by now.

19:49.284 --> 19:52.481
Sam, I confess,
I underestimated you.

19:52.788 --> 19:56.417
I had no idea you thought so much
about me in ways other than sexual.

19:57.210 --> 20:01.203
Unfortunately, I can't possibly
do that at the moment.

20:01.590 --> 20:04.024
Oh, Sam.

20:06.513 --> 20:09.107
You moved me very deeply tonight.

20:10.226 --> 20:14.663
Well, it moves me deeply
to move you deeply.

20:17.360 --> 20:20.113
Speaking of depths,
would I be sinking to one

20:20.405 --> 20:24.876
if I were to suggest that we carry
this conversation back to my place?

20:25.703 --> 20:29.378
- Sam, my God.
- Oh, dear, what?

20:31.126 --> 20:33.242
I wasn't expecting this.

20:33.546 --> 20:36.743
I'm experiencing emotions
I haven't felt for so long.

20:37.050 --> 20:39.439
My heart's saying yes,
my mind's saying no.

20:39.762 --> 20:43.994
Well, why don't you let some other
part of your body break the tie for you?

20:47.063 --> 20:49.099
I think I'd better go.

20:50.859 --> 20:52.929
My purse.

20:53.779 --> 20:55.371
Oh, boy.

21:01.413 --> 21:03.324
Oh, Sam, I can't fight it.

21:03.625 --> 21:06.617
Everything tonight has been
leading me right into your arms.

21:07.880 --> 21:10.269
Let me get this clear here.
You're saying that we--

21:11.009 --> 21:15.127
We always get into
so much trouble when we talk.

21:17.350 --> 21:21.229
Let's not. Let's just do.

21:22.648 --> 21:25.924
From now on, no words.

21:26.235 --> 21:30.114
I can't believe this.
This is like a dream I had once.

21:32.076 --> 21:34.749
- This was good back here.
- Yeah, it was.

21:37.958 --> 21:44.113
This is becoming the most perfect
evening we've ever had together.

21:47.678 --> 21:49.634
Oh, boy.

21:53.060 --> 21:54.652
Sam?

21:55.438 --> 21:57.793
- What is it?
- Oh, l--

21:58.108 --> 22:01.259
I can't believe I'm about to say this.

22:01.612 --> 22:04.490
I gotta be honest with you.

22:05.325 --> 22:09.443
Frasier planned the whole evening.
I had nothing to do with it.

22:11.875 --> 22:13.228
What do you think about that?

22:17.882 --> 22:19.759
Now...

22:20.468 --> 22:23.062
Your saying this to me now

22:23.597 --> 22:26.316
is one of the most wonderful things
you have ever done.

22:27.268 --> 22:29.577
Oh, boy.

22:34.736 --> 22:37.569
I'm even more attracted to you now
than before.

22:37.906 --> 22:40.295
Oh, that's great.
Oh, that's great. Let's go.

22:40.576 --> 22:43.568
- Sam, wait.
- No, no, don't say wait. Don't say wait.

22:43.914 --> 22:48.590
- We can't possibly have sex tonight.
- Sure we can. Sure we can.

22:49.504 --> 22:54.737
No, don't you realize what you did?
You insisted on being honest to me.

22:55.136 --> 22:56.694
Respecting me as a person.

22:56.930 --> 23:01.720
Even though it meant risking
the loss of a night of passion.

23:02.144 --> 23:06.422
Yeah, well, that kind of stuff should be
rewarded, you know?

23:08.819 --> 23:12.653
Sam, you know,
for a change, tonight

23:13.158 --> 23:15.388
you had the cooler head,
and you were right to stop me.

23:15.661 --> 23:20.052
We are developing
a very special relationship,

23:20.458 --> 23:23.734
and it would be wrong
to jeopardize it by having sex.

23:24.588 --> 23:27.660
No. I want to jeopardize it with sex.

23:28.009 --> 23:31.399
- It would be a test.
- Sam. Sam, we're regressing.

23:31.764 --> 23:35.200
You're backsliding.
We're not ready yet.

23:35.560 --> 23:39.838
Well, do you have an estimate
on when we might be ready?

23:40.191 --> 23:41.590
I mean, is it minutes here?
Come on.

23:41.818 --> 23:44.457
Sam, this was
a real breakthrough for us.

23:44.780 --> 23:47.977
I think it's very important
for each of us to be alone.

23:48.326 --> 23:52.239
No, I agree. As soon as we're done,
I'll leave. I promise.

23:54.500 --> 23:58.459
- Good night, Sam.
- No, no, wait. Here.

23:58.680 --> 24:00.796
Oh, no. No.
