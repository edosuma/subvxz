00:04.520 --> 00:05.999
WOMAN:
This is me, I was traveling

00:06.040 --> 00:09.043
at 35 miles per hour
down Bosworth Avenue,

00:09.090 --> 00:11.046
when I saw the light
at Le Moyne changing,

00:11.090 --> 00:13.820
so I pulled to a stop.

00:13.880 --> 00:15.836
CANNING:
And did you see something
in your rearview mirror?

00:15.880 --> 00:17.097
WOMAN:
I did.

00:17.140 --> 00:19.096
A car coming up behind me.

00:19.140 --> 00:21.927
CANNING:
And how fast was it traveling?

00:21.970 --> 00:23.926
WOMAN:
About 35 miles per hour.

00:23.980 --> 00:25.925
But it didn't stop or slow down.

00:25.980 --> 00:28.972
It just rammed
right into my car.

00:29.020 --> 00:31.193
It shoved me
into the cross traffic,

00:31.240 --> 00:34.767
and that's how
I ended up here.

00:34.810 --> 00:36.766
In a wheelchair.

00:36.810 --> 00:37.765
For life.

00:37.820 --> 00:39.299
Yes.

00:39.340 --> 00:41.808
Who was driving the car
that hit you, Wendy?
Him.

00:41.860 --> 00:42.986
CANNING:
Let the record reflect

00:43.040 --> 00:44.814
that Wendy pointed
to Tim Brewster.

00:44.870 --> 00:46.815
Excuse me, I wasn't
driving that car.

00:46.870 --> 00:47.825
Tim.
What?

00:47.870 --> 00:49.030
Why aren't you objecting?

00:49.090 --> 00:50.216
It's a depo, Tim.

00:50.260 --> 00:51.602
We'll get to your
side of things.

00:51.660 --> 00:52.991
CANNING: Who was behind
the wheel, Wendy?

00:53.050 --> 00:55.041
Tim Brewster.And did he see you?

00:55.090 --> 00:57.832
Yes. I saw him in
the rearVIew mirror.

00:57.880 --> 01:00.098
He clearly saw my car.CANNING: But he didn't slow
down? He didn't stop?

01:00.140 --> 01:02.096
WENDY: That's right.Would you like to say something,
Mr. Ephraham?

01:02.140 --> 01:04.608
I'm not being deposed.It wasn't my fault,

01:04.670 --> 01:06.092
and you know it--
it was your car's fault.

01:06.150 --> 01:08.141
Why don't we take
a moment, please?

01:09.150 --> 01:11.106
Tim, I thought we agreed.

01:11.150 --> 01:13.106
We're going in there
with a united front.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.936
Yeah, somehow a united front
means I get screwed.

01:15.980 --> 01:17.197
_ It was in
driverless mode.

01:17.250 --> 01:18.899
I tried hitting the brake,
I tried turning.

01:18.940 --> 01:20.111
That's impossible,
and you know it.

01:20.160 --> 01:21.115
Even in driverless mode,
it can be overridden

01:21.160 --> 01:22.764
at any time.
Yeah, yeah.

01:22.820 --> 01:24.117
And I'm telling you
I couldn't override it.

01:24.170 --> 01:25.421
Then that's your
fault, isn't it?

01:25.470 --> 01:27.256
All right, let's not
talk about fault.

01:27.300 --> 01:29.996
[arguing indistinctly]

01:30.040 --> 01:31.257
Great job.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.120
Keep blaming Tim,
it'll split 'em up.

01:33.180 --> 01:35.171
Then what?

01:40.100 --> 01:42.045
They're setting you up.

01:42.100 --> 01:44.056
I'm not talking to you.

01:44.100 --> 01:46.056
What else can they do?

01:46.100 --> 01:48.148
Your CEO friend can't admit
that it was his autonomous car

01:48.190 --> 01:50.101
that malfunctioned...Buddy, save yourself the breath.

01:50.150 --> 01:51.310
I'm not joining your side.

01:51.370 --> 01:53.326
Don't.

01:53.370 --> 01:54.883
But get yourself
your own lavwer.

01:54.940 --> 01:56.328
Because they're not
gonna defend you.

01:56.370 --> 01:58.895
Your business means
nothing to them.

01:58.940 --> 02:00.589
It's the CEO that's
the deep pocket here.

02:03.250 --> 02:05.764
Call her.

02:05.820 --> 02:07.765
[overlapping chatter]

02:07.820 --> 02:09.037
LANDAU: Everybody,
take your seats please.

02:09.080 --> 02:10.593
We're ready to start.

02:12.210 --> 02:14.212
Vote no
on the first vote.

02:14.260 --> 02:16.034
Don't forget.

02:16.090 --> 02:18.046
Well, welcome back

02:18.090 --> 02:20.081
to the Chicago election
board, everyone.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.085
We have a full agenda,
so I'd like to get started.

02:22.140 --> 02:24.870
But first I'd like
to welcome our newest member.

02:24.920 --> 02:26.444
Alicia Florrick.

02:27.930 --> 02:30.057
We want to thank her
for giving her expertise

02:30.100 --> 02:33.058
and her independence to the
great work of this committee.

02:33.100 --> 02:35.056
I believe, uh, we still
have a vote outstanding.

02:35.110 --> 02:37.237
Yes, we do,
Mr. Chair.

02:37.280 --> 02:39.191
Regarding the
status of KLT.

02:39.240 --> 02:40.229
We were tied,
three to three.

02:40.290 --> 02:41.587
Thank you, Mr. Hallman.

02:41.630 --> 02:43.450
The tabled motion
was to replace

02:43.510 --> 02:45.933
the current licensee
With Swan Systems.

02:45.990 --> 02:47.946
All those in favor of
Mr. Hallman's motion,

02:47.990 --> 02:49.946
please raise your hand.

02:49.990 --> 02:51.241
All those opposed.

02:54.130 --> 02:55.461
HALLMAN:
Three opposed.

02:55.520 --> 02:57.033
We're tied again.

02:57.080 --> 02:58.160
Mrs. Florrick, you have
the right to vote...

02:58.220 --> 02:59.164
She doesn't
have to vote.

02:59.220 --> 03:00.437
I'm sorry.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.175
I have no idea
what the issue is.

03:04.350 --> 03:05.829
Mr. Hallman believes

03:05.880 --> 03:08.007
we should replace
our current contractor

03:08.050 --> 03:10.132
for election machines with
a new one, Swan Systems.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.226
Even though
you are new

03:12.270 --> 03:14.534
to this committee, Mrs.
Florrick, you can vote.

03:14.580 --> 03:15.968
If she doesn't want to vote,
she doesn't have to vote.

03:16.020 --> 03:17.271
Mrs. Florrick, do
you want to vote?

03:21.110 --> 03:23.066
Good.

03:23.110 --> 03:25.192
All those in favor
of the motion.

03:27.070 --> 03:28.856
All those opposed.

03:30.900 --> 03:32.595
HALLMAN:
No, this is bullcrap.

03:32.640 --> 03:35.074
You bought her! No, sir!Mr. Hallman!

03:35.120 --> 03:37.259
I supported your membership,
Mrs. Florrick,

03:37.300 --> 03:38.858
because I thought you
would be honest here.

03:38.910 --> 03:40.218
LANDAU:
The vote didnâ€˜t
go your way, Sll'.

03:40.260 --> 03:41.557
Now get
over it.

03:41.610 --> 03:44.033
Okay. Let's move on
to the financial...

03:45.050 --> 03:46.995
[elevator doors close]

03:47.050 --> 03:48.699
[elevator bell dings]

03:49.830 --> 03:51.559
Hey.Hey.

03:51.620 --> 03:53.133
Everything all right?

03:53.180 --> 03:54.829
Yeah. You heading out?

03:54.880 --> 03:57.348
Prior accidents
of a self-drIVIng car.

03:57.410 --> 03:59.355
Ah. What?

03:59.410 --> 04:02.447
New case. Four
hours, capped.

04:02.500 --> 04:04.752
Oh. Um...

04:04.800 --> 04:06.540
can you do me a favor?

04:06.590 --> 04:07.887
That depends.

04:07.940 --> 04:09.328
Could you find out
about a company

04:09.370 --> 04:11.156
called KLT
and what connection it has

04:11.200 --> 04:13.248
with the head of the Democratic
Committee, Frank Landau?

04:13.290 --> 04:15.986
All right. What
am I looking for?Anything.

04:16.030 --> 04:18.851
Anything it is.

04:18.910 --> 04:20.855
Oh. Um...

04:20.910 --> 04:23.515
maybe you and I could talk
sometime.

04:23.560 --> 04:26.347
Sure.
What about?

04:26.390 --> 04:27.778
Everything.

04:27.830 --> 04:29.786
Okay.

04:29.830 --> 04:31.309
Tonight. 7:00 pm.

04:31.350 --> 04:33.955
Done.

04:34.010 --> 04:36.308
Mrs. Florrick, I am so
glad you're doing this.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.487
So am I.

04:38.530 --> 04:41.351
We'll meet you there, Tim.

04:41.410 --> 04:44.311
Good case.
A three-way.

04:44.370 --> 04:46.099
With who?

04:46.150 --> 04:48.459
Lockhart/Agos and Louis Canning.

04:48.500 --> 04:49.979
It should
be fun.[groans]

04:50.020 --> 04:52.363
[phone rings]

04:52.420 --> 04:54.934
What's wrong now, Eli?

04:54.990 --> 04:56.321
Have any reporters tried
to call you?

04:56.380 --> 04:57.722
No. Why?

04:57.770 --> 05:00.204
If anyone tries to call you,
don't answer.

05:00.250 --> 05:01.205
Why?

05:01.250 --> 05:03.036
Viceis reporting

05:03.080 --> 05:05.207
that you and Peter have not
shared a bed for three years.

05:05.260 --> 05:07.034
Oh, dear God.Yeah.

05:07.080 --> 05:08.775
We're gonna face
some uncomfortable questions.

05:08.830 --> 05:11.469
Let us focus group some answers
before you say anything.

05:11.520 --> 05:13.044
You'd better
get In there.

05:13.090 --> 05:15.399
Alicia, I'll call you back.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.998
FEMALE REPORTER:
Is the governor staying
with his wife while he's back

05:17.050 --> 05:19.006
in Chicago?MALE REPORTER:
And if not, why not?

05:19.050 --> 05:20.312
Is it because
the Florrick marriage is...?

05:20.360 --> 05:22.316
What can I promise?

05:22.360 --> 05:25.659
What do you need?This week.
Peter's here for the vote.

05:25.710 --> 05:28.235
[reporters clamoring]Folks, hold on, hold on.

05:28.280 --> 05:29.440
You can rip me up later.

05:29.500 --> 05:31.934
This Vicearticle is nonsense.

05:31.980 --> 05:34.232
REPORTERS: Nonsense?Peter is back in Illinois
this week

05:34.290 --> 05:36.895
__ to veto the__ _
phySICIan-aSSIsted swcrde bill.

05:36.940 --> 05:38.714
And of course he'll be staying
with his wife.

05:38.770 --> 05:40.021
Ruth...You're getting

05:40.070 --> 05:41.594
to Alicia?Right now.

05:41.640 --> 05:43.688
I'm sure you're all aware,
Peter's been spending

05:43.730 --> 05:46.335
a lot of time in Iowa...Alicia, can you call me
as soon as you can?

05:46.380 --> 05:47.722
The campaign needs to ask you
a favor.

05:47.780 --> 05:49.736
Ma'am, this just came in.
Thanks.

05:49.780 --> 05:52.385
You miss it?

05:52.430 --> 05:55.513
The pressure to bill hours,
kowtow to clients,

05:55.570 --> 05:57.652
and wrangle all
the personalities?

05:57.700 --> 05:59.088
The money?

05:59.140 --> 06:01.085
The money
never really materialized.

06:01.140 --> 06:05.133
It always seemed to be
somewhere over the horizon.Yeah.

06:05.190 --> 06:07.795
I can see you here.
Making clients wait.

06:07.840 --> 06:11.059
Ordering associates around.
Being the queen bee bitch.

06:11.100 --> 06:13.842
[chuckles]
I'm a much calmer
person now.

06:13.890 --> 06:15.972
Oh, my God, that's a
terrifying thought.

06:16.020 --> 06:17.931
[Alicia chuckles]

06:17.980 --> 06:20.369
Shall we?

06:22.640 --> 06:24.631
Sorry for our lateness.

06:26.120 --> 06:27.599
Lucca Quinn and...

06:31.780 --> 06:33.202
...Alicia Florrick.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.604
We've filed a
substitution of attorney

06:36.650 --> 06:39.437
with_the court. We're
representing Mr. Brewster now.

06:39.480 --> 06:42.210
And we'll decamp here
if that's all right.

06:42.270 --> 06:44.613
That would be great.
Please do.

06:44.660 --> 06:47.094
LUCCA:
Well, shall we start?

06:48.930 --> 06:51.057
EPHRAHAM:
These are the laser ranging
and detection units.

06:51.100 --> 06:54.627
The car uses them to create
a 3-D map of the street ahead

06:54.670 --> 06:58.322
to see and avoid
any potential hazards.

06:58.370 --> 07:01.328
On the front and rear bumper,
there are three radar units.

07:01.370 --> 07:03.452
They detect the speed
of oncoming cars

07:03.510 --> 07:05.853
_ and slow down
if there are any obstacles.

07:05.900 --> 07:07.936
And these are all
redundant technologies?Yes.

07:11.690 --> 07:15.512
It is by far the safest
car on the road today.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.209
No one has_eyer died
or been injured

07:17.260 --> 07:19.649
in any car accident caused
by my T-Port.

07:19.700 --> 07:20.860
That would be news
to my client.

07:20.910 --> 07:23.174
That accident was not caused
by my car.

07:23.220 --> 07:25.176
It was caused
by one of my employees,

07:25.220 --> 07:27.347
who took the car for an
unauthorized test drive.

07:27.400 --> 07:29.391
Which is why your client
should not be suing me.

07:29.440 --> 07:31.658
She should be suing that
gentleman over there.

07:31.710 --> 07:33.928
But I guess
I have too deep a pocket.Thank you,

07:33.970 --> 07:35.665
Mr. Ephraham.
Your witness.

07:35.710 --> 07:38.668
Is it legal to drive this car--
strike that.

07:38.710 --> 07:41.759
Is it legal for this car
to drive itself

07:41.800 --> 07:42.755
in the state
of Illinois?

07:42.810 --> 07:44.584
No. But it is in Michigan.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.769
That's nice.
Why is it illegal in Illinois?

07:46.810 --> 07:49.370
Well, some states want
more data.

07:49.420 --> 07:52.412
Unfortunately,
data like this nuisance suit

07:52.470 --> 07:54.506
won't help.Well,
it's unfortunate

07:54.560 --> 07:55.686
that my client got in the way
of your car's progress.

07:55.730 --> 07:57.118
I didn't
say that.

07:57.170 --> 07:58.512
Ms. Searle's injury
is unfortunate,

07:58.560 --> 08:00.516
but it has nothing whatever
to do with my car.

08:00.560 --> 08:02.346
Technology can overcome
most obstacles,

08:02.390 --> 08:03.869
but it can't overcome
human nature.

08:03.910 --> 08:05.514
I have no further questions
at this moment.

08:05.570 --> 08:07.788
So why don't we take a break.Actually,

08:07.830 --> 08:09.525
we have_
a few questions.

08:09.570 --> 08:11.879
Of course.

08:11.920 --> 08:13.706
Good afternoon,
Mr. Ephraham.

08:13.750 --> 08:17.538
Good afternoon.In 20_14
you told Wiredmagazme

08:17.580 --> 08:21.050
that the T-Port had
"the most advanced AI software

08:21.100 --> 08:24.843
on the market. Every day
it's learning something new."

08:24.890 --> 08:26.846
What does
that mean?Each time the car is driven,

08:26.890 --> 08:29.620
it learns something new
about a-a street,

08:29.680 --> 08:32.319
the, um, behavioral dynamics
of other drivers, pedestrians,

08:32.380 --> 08:33.415
the objects all around it.

08:33.460 --> 08:35.462
So it gets smarter?Yes.

08:35.510 --> 08:37.558
Which means it isn't smart
to begin with.

08:37.600 --> 08:41.297
Well, it's pretty darn smart.Yes.

08:41.340 --> 08:44.810
But you yourself admit
the software will learn.

08:44.870 --> 08:47.384
So there must be something
to be learned.

08:47.430 --> 08:48.909
EPHRAHAM:
There's always something
to be learned.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.564
ALICIA: _ _
Because every Situation
on the road is unique?

08:50.610 --> 08:52.396
EPHRAHAM:
Yes.Actually, Mr. Ephraham,

08:52.440 --> 08:53.919
don't you mean
that there might be

08:53.960 --> 08:56.520
slight variations
in a road encounter,

08:56.570 --> 08:58.572
and that's all?Yes, that's right.

08:58.620 --> 09:00.963
Thanks, Cary,
for that correction.

09:01.010 --> 09:02.056
Mm-hmm.[phone buzzing]

09:03.230 --> 09:04.538
[beeps]

09:04.580 --> 09:07.583
And why is it important
for the software to learn?

09:07.630 --> 09:11.976
So it knows how to deal with
all possible street encounters.

09:12.020 --> 09:14.580
Which means it doesn't know how
to deal with all encounters now?

09:14.640 --> 09:17.029
No.I-I'm not trying to trick you,
Mr. Ephraham.

09:17.070 --> 09:19.379
If the software
learns,

09:19.420 --> 09:22.423
then it must not know
what it needs to learn, right?

09:25.780 --> 09:27.998
Let's return
to that. Wendy,

09:28.040 --> 09:29.996
was it raining on the day
of your accident?

09:30.040 --> 09:31.564
It was.
Fairly hard.

09:31.610 --> 09:34.602
Mr. Ephraham, is rain one
of those road conditions

09:34.660 --> 09:36.821
that the T-Port needs
to learn how to negotiate?It knows

09:36.880 --> 09:39.963
how to negotiate rain.And yet weren't there
two accidents

09:40.010 --> 09:42.046
on your test track
during a rainstorm?There were

09:42.100 --> 09:44.318
a lot of accidents
on the test track.

09:44.360 --> 09:46.828
That's why we call it
a test track.

09:46.890 --> 09:48.221
The software
was still learning?

09:48.280 --> 09:48.792
Right.

09:48.840 --> 09:50.535
As it is now?

Why don't

09:52.670 --> 09:55.491

I'm being ganged up on.

09:55.550 --> 09:58.110
I've got lavwers crawling
all over me because you two

09:58.160 --> 10:00.321
lost me Tim.We didn't lose him, sir.

10:00.380 --> 10:03.850
He exercised his right
to find another lavwer.Watch out,

10:03.900 --> 10:05.982
or I might, too.

10:06.040 --> 10:08.508
What do you think?

10:08.560 --> 10:11.518
I think we're treating Alicia
like an enemy

10:11.560 --> 10:14.028
when we should be treating her
like a free agent.

10:14.090 --> 10:16.046

Very well played in there.

10:16.090 --> 10:17.603

They'll probably be coming
after Wendy next,

10:19.140 --> 10:21.529
so we should talk.[elevator bell dings]

Tell me if it's too strong.

10:39.680 --> 10:42.717
So, this must be serious.

in your kitchen.

Yeah, well...

No, no, it's just,
I, um,

10:47.860 --> 10:51.079
I was wanting
to see how you...

10:51.120 --> 10:53.076
liked it here.

10:53.130 --> 10:54.813
Here, at your work?

10:54.870 --> 10:56.735
Yeah.

10:56.780 --> 10:58.509
I like it.

10:58.570 --> 10:59.867
How am I doing?

10:59.920 --> 11:01.694
Great.

Well, good,
we're both great.

No, I...

if you could Sign this

It's just a standard

11:47.480 --> 11:49.698
Mm, in case I beat someone up?

11:49.750 --> 11:50.739
No, just in case anything.

11:50.790 --> 11:53.179
You know, you...
trip on my stairs.

11:53.230 --> 11:54.788

On an ice tray.

11:56.540 --> 11:59.236
[laughs]

11:59.280 --> 12:01.623
I hate doing it.

12:01.670 --> 12:03.752
But, um, the insurance
is expensive

12:03.810 --> 12:07.155
and it cuts down on cost.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.713
And if I don't sign it?

12:11.770 --> 12:13.635
If you don't...

12:13.680 --> 12:15.204
Well, why wouldn't you sign it?

12:15.250 --> 12:17.810
I don't like signing things.

12:19.820 --> 12:23.210

that we're not a big firm,

No.

Well, go in there and
see if it's really her.

15:39.060 --> 15:40.971
And... how am I
supposed to do that?

15:41.020 --> 15:42.624

15:42.680 --> 15:44.159
See if there's a scar
on her hand.

15:44.200 --> 15:46.236
You're joking.

15:46.290 --> 15:48.679

comfort her fears.

out. I'll talk to Alicia.

March. Why?

17:55.240 --> 17:57.060
I have no words.

You've had
your fair share of accidents

haven't you, Ms. Searle?

18:06.990 --> 18:08.594
Well, what do you mean?

18:08.650 --> 18:10.299
It means they're
blaming the victim.

18:10.350 --> 18:13.126
You were found at fault
in an accident in 2010

18:13.170 --> 18:15.218
and then in 2012.

18:15.260 --> 18:17.820
Yes, but that was
different than this.Also, your driver's license

18:17.870 --> 18:19.747
indicates that you wear
corrective lenses.

18:19.790 --> 18:21.132

full answer going to be?

No, but I don't need
the contact lenses for driving.

Good, thank you. And on
the night of the accident,

18:41.160 --> 18:42.411
were you texting

Was I...

18:56.430 --> 19:00.082

19:29.210 --> 19:30.939
JASON:
Not a lot of luck in
finding T-Port accidents.

19:30.990 --> 19:32.332
The car is pretty damn safe.

19:32.380 --> 19:33.779
That's too bad.

19:33.820 --> 19:34.775
And yet?

19:34.820 --> 19:36.549
Two things.

19:36.610 --> 19:39.602
A month before the
accident they added

19:39.650 --> 19:41.208
a fuzzy driving feature
to the software.

19:41.260 --> 19:43.125
A what?Fuzzy driving--

19:43.180 --> 19:45.216
they found that the car
obeyed traffic laws

19:45.270 --> 19:46.612
a little too well.

19:46.660 --> 19:49.220
It would stop at a
four-way stop and let

19:49.270 --> 19:51.135
all the other cars
keep going through,

19:51.190 --> 19:53.181
because it_ was
supposed to wait for them

19:53.230 --> 19:54.538
to come to a complete stop.

19:54.580 --> 19:56.093
So, essentially,
it never moved.

19:56.150 --> 19:57.754
The car was toosafe?Right.

19:57.800 --> 20:00.234
So Ephraham added
the fuzzy driving feature.

20:00.280 --> 20:02.236
Made the car more aggressive,

20:02.280 --> 20:03.190
more human.

20:03.240 --> 20:05.105
It would
roll through stop signs.

20:05.160 --> 20:08.243
It would be more aggressive
when changing lanes.

20:08.290 --> 20:09.723
So they made it... less safe?

20:09.770 --> 20:11.544
Could argue that.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.249
LUCCA:
That's a pretty good argument.

20:13.290 --> 20:14.552
What's the second thing?

20:14.600 --> 20:16.648
The hard drive was erased...

20:16.690 --> 20:18.169
after the accident.

20:18.210 --> 20:20.815
What?I tried to download

20:20.870 --> 20:23.213
a record of the accident
from the T-Port.

20:23.260 --> 20:24.818
There was nothing there.

20:24.870 --> 20:27.088
Somebody erased
the hard drive.

20:27.130 --> 20:29.212
Really?

20:31.310 --> 20:33.870
ALICIA:
Mr. Hallman.

20:33.920 --> 20:35.353
Hello. May I help you?

20:35.400 --> 20:36.958
Is your house always like this?

20:37.010 --> 20:39.752
[chuckles]
No, this is unusual.

20:39.800 --> 20:42.189
Um... would you
like to sit down?

20:42.240 --> 20:44.185
I want you to stop
being a stooge.

20:45.240 --> 20:46.673
I'm-I'm not sure...

20:46.720 --> 20:48.881
You're Landau's
stooge on the board.

20:48.940 --> 20:51.283
You're voting with him, and
he's a corrupt son of a bitch.

20:51.330 --> 20:55.061
Mr. Hallman, whatever your
issues are with Mr. Landau...

20:55.120 --> 20:57.759
My issue isn't with Mr. Landau.
He's beyond saving.

20:57.820 --> 20:59.299
But you're not.

20:59.340 --> 21:01.900
I'm bringing this up for
another vote this week.

21:01.950 --> 21:03.906
Then I'm gonna ask Landau
to stand down

21:03.950 --> 21:06.339
and nominate you
to take the chair.

21:07.390 --> 21:08.778
You... What?

21:08.830 --> 21:11.435
There are enough votes
to put a woman in charge.

21:11.480 --> 21:12.913
Everybody's been feeling
the pressure

21:12.960 --> 21:14.951
from their home districts...Mr. Hallman,
I just...

21:15.010 --> 21:17.444
but I need you to vote
against KLT.

21:17.490 --> 21:20.960
Then I can make
you chair.But I don't want to be chair.

21:21.010 --> 21:22.352
Mrs. Florrick...

21:22.410 --> 21:25.311
corruption doesn't start
out there.

21:25.370 --> 21:27.793
It doesn't start in
DC. or Springfield.

21:27.850 --> 21:30.273
It starts here, in you and me,

21:30.330 --> 21:33.231
and only if we let
it happen, so don't.

21:33.290 --> 21:34.939
It's as easy as that.

21:34.980 --> 21:36.379
Just don't.

21:45.260 --> 21:47.512
EPHRAHAM:
...safe gap left by the T-Port.

21:47.560 --> 21:49.346
This accident was not caused

21:49.390 --> 21:51.381
by fuzzy driving.But fuzzy driving

21:51.440 --> 21:53.305
makes the car drive
more like a human, right?

21:53.350 --> 21:54.954
Yes. Like a safehuman

21:55.000 --> 21:57.343
that still follows
the traffic laws.But not in the case

21:57.400 --> 21:59.482
of keeping a safe
two-car distance on the freeway.DIANE: Wait a minute.

21:59.530 --> 22:01.578
Stop ganging up here.The only reason

22:01.620 --> 22:03.440
we added that feature
is because human drivers

22:03.490 --> 22:05.663
kept dangerously merging
into the safe gap

22:05.710 --> 22:07.143
left by the T-Port.

22:07.190 --> 22:09.101
That's why the T-Port
has been more aggressive.

22:09.150 --> 22:11.050
In other words, that's
why it tailgates?

22:11.110 --> 22:12.407
Objection.
He didn't say that.EPHRAHAM: No.

22:12.460 --> 22:14.269
Not tailgates.
Look, its humandrivers

22:14.330 --> 22:16.582
_ are the ones
making roads more dangerous.

22:16.630 --> 22:18.586
Th-The T-Port is just adapting.

22:18.640 --> 22:21.245
By being more aggressive,
by being more human,

22:21.290 --> 22:23.417
which resulted
in this accident.No. This accident was caused

22:23.470 --> 22:25.631
by humans.Then why did you erase
the car's hard drive?

22:27.340 --> 22:30.252
I did not erase the hard drive.

22:30.300 --> 22:32.382
Then how did it get erased?CARY: Why don't
we take a break?

22:32.430 --> 22:33.863
No, I'd like to answer that.

22:33.910 --> 22:36.344
The hard drive was damaged
by the force of the accident.

22:36.390 --> 22:37.379
We're not talking

22:37.440 --> 22:39.260
about an airplane's
black box here.

22:39.310 --> 22:41.619
It is vulnerable
to impact.

22:41.660 --> 22:43.389
TIM:
That's not true.

22:43.440 --> 22:44.486
You've had
several other accidents--

22:44.530 --> 22:46.350
never has there been
any data loss.

22:46.400 --> 22:48.356
Yes, but that was
a real-world...CANNING: Excuse me.

22:48.410 --> 22:50.275
Mr. Brewster's

22:50.320 --> 22:51.708
LUCCA:
So, if the accident

22:51.760 --> 22:53.625
didn't erase the hard
drive, how'd it happen?

22:53.670 --> 22:56.104
Obviously somebody
deliberately erased the data

22:56.150 --> 22:57.367
after the fact.MAN:
No.

22:58.460 --> 23:00.849
Excuse me.
Who are you?

Mr. Dudewitz...

23:08.900 --> 23:11.596
I do mind.
I do mind mediocrity.

23:11.650 --> 23:14.039
It has a taint,
like burned toast,

23:14.080 --> 23:15.991
and you stink of it.

23:16.040 --> 23:18.429
[several speaking at once]All right, let me just
tell you, Mr. Dudewitz

23:18.480 --> 23:20.732
is the original developer
of the T-Portable.

23:42.500 --> 23:45.060
Yes, I work

He handles the money;
I handle the genius.

your speCIfic involvement

23:49.070 --> 23:50.594
with the T-Portable?

23:50.640 --> 23:52.688
I designed the interface.
I hired most of these monkeys.

23:52.730 --> 23:54.243
Like that idiot.
Let the record

23:54.300 --> 23:57.167
reflect I am nodding
to the code monkey

23:57.210 --> 23:59.383
sitting over there.
Am I boring you?

23:59.430 --> 24:02.160
Oh, far from it.
I can't wait to return.

24:02.220 --> 24:04.859
DIANE:
So, regarding
the hard drive,

24:04.920 --> 24:07.650
you said it couldn't
have been manually erased?

24:07.700 --> 24:10.567
Not without leaving
some electronic trace.

24:10.620 --> 24:12.349
There is no connection
between the deSIgner

24:12.400 --> 24:15.574
of the voting machines,
KLT, and Frank Landau.

24:15.620 --> 24:17.099
But...?

24:17.150 --> 24:18.572
How do you know
there's a "but"?

24:18.630 --> 24:20.666
There's always a "but" with you.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.324
[laughs]
But...

24:22.370 --> 24:25.191
there is a connection
between KLT

24:25.240 --> 24:27.800
and a shell company
called Pigster Union,

24:27.850 --> 24:30.978
owned by none other than
Frank Landau's wife.

24:31.030 --> 24:32.190
Really?

24:32.250 --> 24:35.151
And why is this
important?

24:35.210 --> 24:37.508
No reason._
Just... something.

24:37.560 --> 24:40.518
Um, hey, I'm really sorry
about last night with Peter.

24:40.560 --> 24:42.608
Why? Cool guy.

24:42.650 --> 24:43.821

24:43.870 --> 24:45.087
"Cool"?Yeah.

24:45.130 --> 24:47.439
_ You still owe me
mini tacos, by the way.

24:47.480 --> 24:49.528
I'll get right on that.Hey, one other thing.

24:49.570 --> 24:50.343
This guy...

24:50.400 --> 24:52.049
Dudewitz? Yeah?Yeah,

24:52.090 --> 24:53.352
I've seen him on TED Talk.

24:53.400 --> 24:55.174
You might want to
ask him something.

24:55.230 --> 24:56.618
TED Talk? Really?

24:56.660 --> 24:58.446
Yeah. What's wrong?

24:58.490 --> 25:00.014
No, no, you just...

25:00.060 --> 25:02.494
you don't seem like
the TED Talk kind of guy.

25:02.540 --> 25:05.008
Ah. I'm an insomniac.

25:05.060 --> 25:09.099
You'd be surprised what
I get into late at night.

25:09.150 --> 25:10.151
Does that answer
your question?

25:10.200 --> 25:11.679
Can I make it even
Simpler for you?

25:11.720 --> 25:13.585
Tell me if these words
get too complicated.

25:13.640 --> 25:15.801
No. I'm good.

25:15.860 --> 25:18.590
So the hard diSk
could not have been erased?

25:18.640 --> 25:20.335
Yep. Can I go now?

25:20.380 --> 25:21.984
Um, actually,
just a few questions

25:23.950 --> 25:25.906
You're back. We've been
having fun in here.

25:25.950 --> 25:27.212
I'm glad.

25:27.260 --> 25:29.603
I guess you devised
the fuzzy driving sobeare

25:29.650 --> 25:31.049
for the T-Port?

25:31.090 --> 25:33.308
YeS_. You are correct
in your guess.

25:33.350 --> 25:36.171
And I imagine this is the
very definition

25:36.230 --> 25:38.221
of A.I.,
artificial intelligence?

25:38.270 --> 25:39.521
How sweet.

25:39.580 --> 25:41.741
You helpfully explained
what A.I. meanS.

25:41.800 --> 25:44.485
You are again correct
in your imagination.Mr. Dudewitz,

25:44.540 --> 25:48.010
what do you think
of the future of A.I.?

25:48.060 --> 25:50.108
Objection. Speculation.

25:51.150 --> 25:53.892
It's a proper objection,
even in a deposition.

25:53.940 --> 25:56.716
I'll rephrase.
What do you think of A.I.?

25:56.770 --> 25:58.897
What do you want
to know? Just ask.

25:58.940 --> 26:01.158
Are we in danger
from A.I.?

26:01.210 --> 26:03.075
I think it's getting smarter.

but eventually...Wait, I'm sorry to interrupt.

26:11.780 --> 26:13.384
Um, what do you mean
by "takes over"?

26:13.440 --> 26:16.125
DUDEWITZ:

Stephen Hawking,
Bill Gates...

26:42.420 --> 26:44.069
So this iS not an
unorthodox position?

26:44.120 --> 26:47.499
Certainly it's unorthodox--
it's held by geniuses,

26:47.560 --> 26:48.686

Thank you, Cary.
One last question.

26:52.480 --> 26:54.778
How do youthink
the car's hard drive got erased?

26:54.830 --> 26:55.774
Objection.

26:55.830 --> 26:57.309
Speculation.I-I'll rephrase.

26:57.350 --> 26:59.989
Do you think that the car's...

27:00.050 --> 27:02.564

its own memory?

27:02.620 --> 27:03.689
YeS, I do.

27:03.750 --> 27:05.092
ALICIA: And if
you believe that,

27:05.140 --> 27:06.914
don't you think
that the software

could override
the safety features?

27:10.750 --> 27:12.923
I don't think
I would go that far.

27:12.970 --> 27:14.881
But if you believe

27:32.040 --> 27:34.338
Mr. Dudewitz,

27:34.390 --> 27:36.346
do you have

I am a smart man.

28:05.330 --> 28:07.116
Hey, guyS.

28:07.160 --> 28:11.153
PETER:
Well, we couldn't have gone
this far without your support.

28:11.210 --> 28:13.678
Well, thank you, Mr. Oliver.
Thank you.

28:13.730 --> 28:15.550
I deeply, deeply appreciate it.

28:15.600 --> 28:16.726
Okay.

28:16.780 --> 28:18.680
You, too.

28:18.740 --> 28:20.958
Another fund-raising call?

28:21.000 --> 28:23.343
Yeah. Well,
it's a necessary evil.

28:23.390 --> 28:26.177
But then, uh,
you'd know about that.

28:27.180 --> 28:28.522
Tequila?

28:28.570 --> 28:30.356
Wow.

28:30.400 --> 28:32.049
You've graduated.

28:32.100 --> 28:34.398
I am in a celebratory mood.

28:34.450 --> 28:36.350
Oh? Good day in court?

28:36.410 --> 28:38.571
There's nothing better
than a good cross.

28:38.620 --> 28:40.269
[chuckles softly]You?

28:40.320 --> 28:42.925
Well, that was $1 million.

28:42.980 --> 28:44.322
Yeah.

28:44.370 --> 28:45.496
Things are clicking.

28:45.540 --> 28:47.019
I like when things click.

28:49.980 --> 28:51.982
Mmm.

28:53.160 --> 28:55.116
You're okay in the bonus room?

28:55.160 --> 28:56.718
Yeah.

28:56.770 --> 28:59.034
Feels like old times.

29:00.430 --> 29:03.297
Want to get laid?

29:03.350 --> 29:04.647
[swallows]

29:07.310 --> 29:09.119
Do you?

29:11.440 --> 29:13.658
Sure. I've got 20 minutes.

29:13.700 --> 29:15.429
Me, too.

29:28.760 --> 29:31.194
Next stop, Lincoln Bedroom.

29:31.240 --> 29:33.026
[chuckles]
Think it's any different there?

29:33.070 --> 29:35.379
Oh, yeah-- everybody
gets laid there.

29:35.420 --> 29:38.890
You think you have a shot?I think Ruth thinks

29:38.950 --> 29:40.247
I have a Shot...

29:40.300 --> 29:43.076
if things go wrong with Hillary.

29:43.120 --> 29:45.384
Or Bernie.

29:50.870 --> 29:52.428
Zach's?

29:52.480 --> 29:54.607
Yeah.[clicks on music]

29:54.660 --> 29:56.002
First time I saw her...

29:56.050 --> 29:57.608
This all right?

29:57.660 --> 30:00.311
Are you planning
on making noise?

30:00.360 --> 30:02.351
Just in case.

30:02.400 --> 30:06.018
[phone ringing]

30:06.060 --> 30:07.834
No.

30:07.890 --> 30:09.846
That's another million dollars.

30:09.890 --> 30:12.108
[ringing continues]Which do you want more?

30:16.980 --> 30:19.323
Where's Peter?

30:19.380 --> 30:20.859
Sleeping.

30:21.900 --> 30:24.073
[music blasting behind door]

30:24.120 --> 30:27.510
I've got the whole life
in a pocket, whoa-ho...

30:27.560 --> 30:29.516
Peter?

30:29.560 --> 30:32.256
Everything
I could believe in...

30:32.300 --> 30:34.256
Peter, I have a call.

30:34.310 --> 30:37.393
Be right out.

30:37.440 --> 30:39.396
Uh...

30:39.440 --> 30:41.044
so you're all right
with this?

30:41.100 --> 30:43.523
Peter, I basically
seduced you.

30:43.580 --> 30:45.059
You don't have to call me
in the morning.

30:45.100 --> 30:47.352
Yeah, it was sexy, huh?

30:47.410 --> 30:50.402
It's always sexier not to care.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.750
Why is that?

30:53.800 --> 30:57.497
Because sex is sexier
Without love.

30:57.550 --> 31:00.326
Whoa-ho. ..

31:00.380 --> 31:02.416
Yeah?

31:04.420 --> 31:06.411
I have Mrs. Blumen on the line.

31:06.470 --> 31:08.859
She... wantS to give money,

31:08.910 --> 31:11.686
but she wants
to talk to you.Give it to me.

31:11.730 --> 31:13.425
Mrs. Blumen, hello.

31:13.480 --> 31:14.686
Whoa-ho. ..

31:14.740 --> 31:17.516
How you doing, Eli?

31:17.570 --> 31:19.868
Everything
I could believe in...

31:19.920 --> 31:22.696
I'm... not sure.

31:22.750 --> 31:25.560
Oh. You catching a cold?

31:25.620 --> 31:27.611
In a pocket, whoa-ho...

31:27.660 --> 31:29.833
No. No.

31:29.880 --> 31:32.223
Everything
I could believe in...

31:32.280 --> 31:34.180
You're being smart, aren't you?

31:34.240 --> 31:36.879
Always.

31:36.930 --> 31:39.535
That you make me feel so!

31:39.590 --> 31:41.455
DIANE:
So, if you were driving

31:41.500 --> 31:43.639
at 35 miles per hour,
Mr. Brewster, you had

31:43.680 --> 31:45.807
seven seconds to switch
out of driverless mode

31:45.860 --> 31:48.283
and hit the brakes?But that wasn't
my responsibility.

31:48.340 --> 31:50.240
CARY:
But isn't that part of why
you were in the car?

31:50.290 --> 31:52.372
To step in if it malfunctioned?LUCCA:
Objection.

31:52.430 --> 31:53.909
Mischaracterizes
earlier testimony.

31:53.950 --> 31:55.383
Your objection is preserved
for the judge.

31:55.430 --> 31:57.250
TIM:
All I did was turn
on the defroster.

31:57.300 --> 31:59.291
And then, a few seconds later,
the lightS started flashing,

31:59.350 --> 32:01.432
the _radio st_arts
flipping stations.

32:01.480 --> 32:03.607
It was like the car
had a mind of its own.

32:03.660 --> 32:05.525
So, were you asleep
at the switch?

32:05.570 --> 32:07.618
Excuse me. One interrogator
at a time, please.

32:07.660 --> 32:09.969
But were you asleep
at the switch?I was not asleep.

32:10.010 --> 32:11.523
I never actually
fell asleep.

32:11.580 --> 32:13.389
"Actually asleep"?
Okay, good.

32:13.450 --> 32:14.610
Were you dozing?

32:14.670 --> 32:16.570
The car is supposed
to drive itself.

32:16.630 --> 32:18.234
So you weredozing?CANNING:
Maybe when you were asleep,

32:18.280 --> 32:20.748
you accidentally disengaged
the driverless mode, and...

32:20.800 --> 32:22.233
Objection. He already said
he wasn't Sleeping.

32:22.280 --> 32:23.759
This isn't deposition by ambush.

32:23.810 --> 32:25.493
DIANE:
He's either going
to answer our questions

32:25.550 --> 32:28.587
one at a time or altogether.
It's his choice.

32:28.640 --> 32:31.245
CARY:
So you wereaSIeep
at the switch?

32:35.040 --> 32:37.247
Right now, I'm in full control,

32:37.300 --> 32:39.461
but we can go
driverless at any time.

32:39.520 --> 32:41.556
Thanks for doing this,
Mr. Dudewitz.

32:41.610 --> 32:43.259
I don't like
thank yous.

32:43.300 --> 32:46.178
They're a remnant of
a hypocritical society.

32:46.220 --> 32:49.041
Ready to go
driverless?
Let'S do it.

32:50.660 --> 32:55.575
I can now read, shave, yodel.

32:55.620 --> 32:57.668
The car is driving itself?Yup. I just put into

32:57.710 --> 33:00.668
the GPS the intersection
where the crash happened.

33:00.710 --> 33:02.439
[tires squealing]Oh. Okay, that kid?

33:02.500 --> 33:05.139
That kid could be
the next Steve Jobs.

33:05.200 --> 33:07.009
The car just
saved his life.

33:07.070 --> 33:08.935
You're welcome, kid.
Okay.

33:08.980 --> 33:10.709
We're in the proximity
of where the accident happened.

33:10.770 --> 33:13.375
What did you do then?Nothing. I just sat.

33:13.420 --> 33:15.763
[thumping]What was that?
A pothole.

33:15.810 --> 33:18.552
So, you said you hit
the defroster. When was that?

33:18.600 --> 33:20.374
Uh, just before this
next intersection.

33:20.430 --> 33:23.775
Now.The defroster. And...

33:23.820 --> 33:25.776
Nothing.

33:25.820 --> 33:27.515
All right, what'd you do after
you turned on the defroster?

33:27.570 --> 33:29.128
I turned it off.

33:29.180 --> 33:31.262
And a few seconds later,
the lightS started flashing,

33:31.310 --> 33:34.177
the radio turned on,
and all the windows rolled down.You're wrong.

33:34.220 --> 33:35.619
I'm just telling
you what happened.

33:35.660 --> 33:37.355
Maybe your memory is faulty.

33:37.400 --> 33:38.913
There's no way the A.I. has
control over the windows.

33:38.970 --> 33:41.530
Look, it was cold outside.

33:41.580 --> 33:43.184
The windows rolled down.Maybe you bumped
into the controls.

33:43.230 --> 33:45.369
I did not.Mr. Dudewitz.

33:45.410 --> 33:48.709
If Tim... didn't misremember
if the windows did roll down,

33:48.760 --> 33:50.364
how could that happen?

33:50.410 --> 33:52.321
It couldn't have.
Whenever I see an equation

33:52.370 --> 33:54.975
and it doesn't add up,
I know where the problem lies.

33:55.030 --> 33:56.509
It's with humans.

33:56.550 --> 33:57.892
It's always with humans.

33:57.940 --> 34:00.500
And is the only human
in this equation Tim?

34:00.560 --> 34:04.519
If he was the only one
in the car, if he was...

34:04.560 --> 34:06.778
LUCCA:
Yeah?

34:06.820 --> 34:10.290
There could be
another human involved.

34:10.350 --> 34:12.079
Not one in the car.

34:12.130 --> 34:13.688
VVho?

34:13.740 --> 34:15.696
A hacker.

34:22.970 --> 34:24.699
GRACE: R.L. Burnside?PAIGE: It's all his hits.

34:24.750 --> 34:27.355
I have read
biographies galore,

34:27.410 --> 34:29.184
books on philosophy,
but I... Ifind

34:29.240 --> 34:31.185
that all of life's biggest
questions can be answered

34:31.240 --> 34:32.798
by that CD.

34:32.850 --> 34:34.010
This is great.

34:34.070 --> 34:35.492
Thank you so much.

34:35.550 --> 34:37.233
So when is your actual birthday?

34:37.290 --> 34:38.803
The 14th.

34:38.850 --> 34:40.408
PETER:
Remember that blues club

34:40.460 --> 34:42.416
we went to in, uh,
Georgetown? Monique'S?

34:42.470 --> 34:44.461
Oh, yeah.
It's probably gone now.

34:44.510 --> 34:46.375
Yeah. Believe it or not, this

34:46.430 --> 34:48.591
sophisticated lady
you see sitting there got

34:48.650 --> 34:50.777
on top of the bar and started
dancing with her friends.

34:50.820 --> 34:55.120
Mom? You did?
I was 22, and,
of course, I tripped.

34:55.180 --> 34:58.786
And fell into my armS,
throwing out my back.
ALICIA:
Oh, God, you were such a baby.

34:58.830 --> 35:00.695
GRACE:
So, Ms. Paige, did you really

35:00.750 --> 35:02.172
tell the king of Saudi Arabia

35:02.230 --> 35:04.130
to start letting more women
into the workplace?

35:04.180 --> 35:06.876
I did indeed,
although I did it politely.

35:06.930 --> 35:08.704
How did he respond?

35:08.750 --> 35:10.399
Oh, exactly
how I thought he would.

35:10.450 --> 35:13.271
He, uh, smiled
and asked me to pass the lamb.

35:13.320 --> 35:14.799
[Alicia and Peter laugh]

35:17.590 --> 35:19.285
RUTH:
She was supposed to leave
30 minutes ago.

35:19.330 --> 35:21.104
I'm not sure if that's
a good thing or a bad one.

35:21.160 --> 35:22.286
It's good--
they like each other.

35:22.330 --> 35:23.809
Everything's going great.

35:23.860 --> 35:25.282
Oh, Mr. Gold.

35:25.340 --> 35:27.149
Oh, dear God, what are
you doing here, Jackie?

35:27.210 --> 35:28.507
Ms. Eastman, how are you?

35:28.560 --> 35:29.504
Hello.

35:29.560 --> 35:30.777
This is Howard.

35:30.820 --> 35:31.809
Eli, Ruth.

35:31.860 --> 35:33.293
How do you do?
Hi.

35:33.340 --> 35:34.819
Uh, Peter and Alicia
are having a dinner party

35:34.870 --> 35:36.428
for Ruth-- f-for Grace.

35:36.480 --> 35:37.902
YeS, I know,
that's why we're here.

35:37.960 --> 35:39.518
We have something to tell them.

35:39.570 --> 35:41.174
It's actually not
a good time right now, Jackie.

35:41.220 --> 35:45.042
It's always a good time
to see my son, Mr. Gold.

35:45.830 --> 35:48.526
What can happen?
Oh.

35:48.580 --> 35:51.003
So what was it like
growmg up in Texas?

35:51.060 --> 35:52.960
[door opens]
JACKIE:
Hello!

35:53.020 --> 35:53.839
[door closes]

35:53.890 --> 35:57.053
Mother? What a surprise.

35:57.110 --> 35:58.975
You call that
standing guard?
A man haS got

35:59.020 --> 36:01.102
to know his limitations,
and your mother is mine.

36:01.150 --> 36:06.326
Mmm. Oh. Oh, what is this?
A party?Yes, it's my birthday party.

36:06.380 --> 36:09.941
But your birthday isn't until...We're celebrating a little
early this year, Jackie.

36:09.990 --> 36:12.208
YeS, we're... gonna
celebrate now.

36:12.250 --> 36:14.161
Oh, well, well,

36:14.210 --> 36:16.724
how nice... and how... early.[Peter clearS his throat]

36:16.780 --> 36:21.479
Ms. Paige, this is my mother
Jackie Florrick and her, uh...

36:21.520 --> 36:24.694
Her, uh...
Howard Lyman.

36:24.740 --> 36:26.879
A pleasure, ma'am.
JACKIE:
Oh, the pleasure's all mine.

36:26.920 --> 36:29.081
I-I like Peter's
African-American friends.

36:29.140 --> 36:30.653
Jackie, do you have
a minute out here?

36:30.710 --> 36:32.268
There's something I want
to talk to you about.

36:32.320 --> 36:35.312
Well, yes, but first,
uh, I have some news.

36:35.360 --> 36:37.578
Wehave some news.

36:37.630 --> 36:38.927
Let'S Share
that news later.

36:38.970 --> 36:41.359
Howard and I...
are engaged.

36:41.410 --> 36:43.753
[Jackie laughs]

36:43.810 --> 36:46.199
Are you insane, Mom?!

36:46.240 --> 36:47.969
[laughs]
HOWARD:
We're in love.

36:48.030 --> 36:49.327
[laughter]

36:49.380 --> 36:50.768
Grandma, I'm so happy for you!

36:50.810 --> 36:52.892
Mother? Mother, you...?

36:52.940 --> 36:55.158
This is not a good idea.

36:55.210 --> 36:57.940
It is, Peter,
and I'm so happy.

36:57.990 --> 37:00.038
Who would have thought
we'd find love at this age?

37:00.080 --> 37:02.640
[laughter]

37:02.690 --> 37:04.419
Guess this makes me

37:04.480 --> 37:06.254
Stepfather-General.

37:06.310 --> 37:09.268
[laughter]That'S wonderful.
Congratulations.

37:09.310 --> 37:11.392
ELI:
YeS, wonderful
indeed. I'm sure

37:11.440 --> 37:14.045
you'll want to resume your
celebration out in the hall.

37:14.100 --> 37:15.397
But doesn't anyone want
to hear how he proposed?

37:15.450 --> 37:16.838
PETER AND ELI:
No.
ALICIA:
Oh, yes!

37:16.880 --> 37:18.006
Please.

37:18.060 --> 37:20.699
Well, first of all,
Howard took me

37:20.760 --> 37:22.751
to thiS lovely
dinner at Tournesol.

37:24.890 --> 37:27.620
PAIGE:
So, you were in Selma
during the march?

37:27.680 --> 37:29.750
Yeah, I was there
for a deposition.

37:29.810 --> 37:32.631
Uh, even got to meet the
man himself, Dr. King.

37:32.680 --> 37:34.500
Really?
Mm.

37:34.550 --> 37:36.108
Told him to
speed things up.

37:36.160 --> 37:37.855
Couldn't get
to my car.

37:37.900 --> 37:39.299
[laughter]

37:39.340 --> 37:40.637
JACKIE:
So-so what
brings you here?

37:40.690 --> 37:42.908
You want a drink?
Yeah.

37:42.950 --> 37:45.293
Or a gun.

37:45.350 --> 37:46.954
Oh, just give up, Eli.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.730
Bad things happen
or they don't.

37:49.780 --> 37:52.396
But there'S just too much
craziness in the world.

37:52.440 --> 37:54.431
Like you and Peter?

37:57.050 --> 38:00.838
The old me would be
provoked by that statement.

38:00.880 --> 38:05.624
But the new me...
just doesn't care.

38:05.670 --> 38:09.231
So, yes... like
me and Peter.

38:09.280 --> 38:10.668
JACKIE:
Well,

38:10.720 --> 38:12.415
we'd better get going.

38:12.460 --> 38:14.064
We're meeting
friends downtown.
Mm.

38:14.110 --> 38:16.328
Oh, Peter, dear,
will you get my things?

38:16.380 --> 38:18.416
No. Allow me.Oh.

38:18.470 --> 38:21.507
He's so chivalrous.

38:21.560 --> 38:24.120
It was so nice spending time
with you, Ms. Paige.

38:24.170 --> 38:28.641
You are an inspiration
to all urban children.

38:28.690 --> 38:31.341
Thank you.

38:32.650 --> 38:35.608
Uh, don't beat
yourself up.

38:35.660 --> 38:37.651
I don't know the
first thing about wineS.

38:37.700 --> 38:39.304
Ms. Paige, hello.

38:39.360 --> 38:41.487
Uh, Courtney.

38:41.530 --> 38:43.316
And I still am a Houston girl.

38:43.360 --> 38:46.614
My drink of choice-- any soda
with the word "cherry" in it.

38:46.670 --> 38:50.970
This was a disaster tonight,
wasn't it?

38:51.020 --> 38:54.933
No. I like, um... reality.

38:54.980 --> 38:56.880
Well, you got a lot
of that tonight.

38:56.940 --> 38:58.896
Don't worry so much.

39:00.860 --> 39:03.761
You're the second person
to tell me that tonight.

39:03.810 --> 39:06.552
Well, then it must be true.

39:06.600 --> 39:09.979
[doorbell rings]ALICIA:
I got it.

39:10.040 --> 39:12.736
What are you doing?

39:12.780 --> 39:15.032
What am I...?

39:15.090 --> 39:18.867
Are.... are you asking
what am I doing here?With Craig Hallman?

39:18.920 --> 39:20.171
What are you doing
with Craig Hallman?

39:20.220 --> 39:21.778
Mr. Landau,
I'm a bit tired.
I know

39:21.830 --> 39:23.559
he'S pushing for a new vote.

39:23.620 --> 39:25.394
I know he was here.YeS, and I know

39:25.450 --> 39:27.520
that your wife
is a part owner of KLT.

39:27.580 --> 39:29.741
He tell you that?

39:29.800 --> 39:31.358
No.

39:31.410 --> 39:32.798
Are you gonna vote against me?

39:32.840 --> 39:36.458
Mr. Landau, I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

39:36.500 --> 39:39.060
I can hurt you.

39:39.110 --> 39:41.362
I can hurt Peter.

39:41.420 --> 39:43.411
Gentlemen,

39:43.460 --> 39:46.543
I think thiS man has
something to say to you.

39:46.600 --> 39:48.943
I don't mean physically.

39:48.990 --> 39:51.242
You can recover
from being physically hurt.

39:51.300 --> 39:53.029
Oh, look, just stop it, Frank.

39:53.080 --> 39:57.039
Let me vote the way I want to.

39:57.090 --> 39:59.160
Think about this.

39:59.220 --> 40:02.781
Your new little friend, Hallman,
is part owner of Swan Systems.

40:02.830 --> 40:04.821
Nobody's
innocent here.

40:04.880 --> 40:08.611
So you either vote
for me or him.

40:08.660 --> 40:10.969
Good luck with that.

40:16.760 --> 40:18.489
So, could the T-Port be hacked?

40:18.540 --> 40:21.008
T-Portable, and yes.

40:21.070 --> 40:22.970
CARY: I thought you said
that was impossible.IS that an objection?

40:23.020 --> 40:24.931
What I said was,
it was impossible

40:24.980 --> 40:26.322
for the car to be hacked

40:26.380 --> 40:28.029
without the hacker
leavmg a trace.

40:28.070 --> 40:30.061
The only time
the car is vulnerable

40:30.120 --> 40:32.076
is when it goeS
into computer update.

40:32.120 --> 40:34.338
Someone could plant a virus
while it was happening,

40:34.380 --> 40:36.428
and no one would notice.

40:36.470 --> 40:38.995
So, you're saying the hack
came from inside the company?Yes.

40:39.040 --> 40:42.123
That's what I'm saying.
I did a search.

40:42.170 --> 40:43.512
Mr. Brewster, the idiot coder

40:43.570 --> 40:45.083
over there, had
idiot coder friends,

40:45.130 --> 40:46.859
all idiot coders, too,
and they all eat

40:46.920 --> 40:49.434
at Acapulco, and they all smell
like elephants at the circus.

40:49.490 --> 40:50.912
Mr. Dudewitz.
They hacked
the T-Portable

40:50.970 --> 40:53.131
hard drive before
he took the car out.

40:53.180 --> 40:54.966
ALICIA: They wanted
to play with him?That's right. Humans.

40:55.010 --> 40:57.228
Always there
to disappoint.

40:57.280 --> 40:59.532
They wanted to spook him,
but they crashed his car

40:59.580 --> 41:01.366
into your car, ma'am,
I'm sorry to say.

41:01.410 --> 41:02.627
And then they covered
their tracks?

41:02.670 --> 41:04.194
YeS, they wiped
the hard drive.

41:04.240 --> 41:05.719
I hope you have
enough insurance

41:05.760 --> 41:06.977
to cover this, Charles.

41:07.020 --> 41:08.840
You're pretty happy about this?

41:08.900 --> 41:10.106
It's just money.

41:10.160 --> 41:11.639
One less horse
for your homestead.

41:11.680 --> 41:13.238
Thank you, Mr. Dudewitz.

41:13.290 --> 41:16.373
Can I leave now?

41:24.260 --> 41:25.818
I was just coming to see you.

41:25.870 --> 41:28.600
I'm so glad.Shall we?

41:28.660 --> 41:30.821
It's-it's being cleaned.
Oh.

41:30.870 --> 41:32.826
Just wanted to thank you for
inviting me to the Florricks'.

41:32.880 --> 41:37.260
No problem. I'm sorry
it was so, uh... eventful.

41:37.320 --> 41:39.265
I like events.

41:39.320 --> 41:44.758
No reason to apologize
to me for that.

41:44.800 --> 41:47.530
So what do you think?

41:47.590 --> 41:49.148
Of Peter and Alicia?

41:49.200 --> 41:51.282
I thought they were boring.

41:51.330 --> 41:53.969
Oh.Like a real married couple.

41:54.030 --> 41:57.284
I'm gonna back Peter.

41:57.340 --> 42:01.071
Good.
LANDAU:
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

42:01.120 --> 42:03.293
You have constantly...That's the only reason why
we're in complete disagreement.

42:03.340 --> 42:04.864
...been acting as a gadfly
with only one interest.Imagine if the rest...

42:04.910 --> 42:07.037
That's stopping this board
from moving forward.

42:07.080 --> 42:08.035
Imagine if the rest
of the board was...You're obsessed...

42:08.090 --> 42:08.909
LANDAU:
Any other discussion?

42:08.960 --> 42:11.428
HALLMAN:
Mrs. Florrick,

42:11.480 --> 42:15.393
do you have any discussion
about this very important issue?

42:15.440 --> 42:18.091
Would you likeme to have some?

42:18.140 --> 42:19.869
I would like you
to speak for yourself.

42:25.060 --> 42:28.666
I think that the two
of you... have issues.

42:28.720 --> 42:31.280
That may be true, but you still
have to vote on it.

42:31.330 --> 42:32.809
The election board

42:32.850 --> 42:34.932
either has to renew its license

42:34.980 --> 42:36.971
with KLT
and its voting machines,

42:37.030 --> 42:39.066
or reject it
and license with Swan.

42:39.120 --> 42:40.599
LANDAU:
All those for Swan,

42:40.640 --> 42:42.073
raise your hands.

42:42.120 --> 42:44.168
All those against?

42:45.690 --> 42:47.726
Mrs. Florrick?
