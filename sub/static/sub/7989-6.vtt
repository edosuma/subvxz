00:00.059 --> 00:01.798
<i>Previously
on Shades of Blue...</i>

00:02.000 --> 00:03.165
<i>I heard shots.
They sounded real.</i>

00:03.168 --> 00:04.599
<i>A video game?</i>

00:04.602 --> 00:06.200
I got to make this right.

00:06.203 --> 00:07.969
<i>Neighborhood's raising money
to bury the man I killed.</i>

00:07.971 --> 00:09.737
- This a friend of yours?
- My cousin.

00:09.740 --> 00:11.173
<i>You donated a lot of money.</i>

00:11.175 --> 00:12.807
Want you all to know
that I'm sorry, all right?

00:12.810 --> 00:14.442
Let's go.

00:14.445 --> 00:16.745
- Crooked-ass police.
- Yeah.

00:16.746 --> 00:17.980
Murderers.

00:17.981 --> 00:20.214
There's a rat on my team.

00:20.216 --> 00:22.115
I told you, I'm gonna start
looking at everyone.

00:22.117 --> 00:23.350
Portuguese, right?

00:23.353 --> 00:25.152
But when I realized
the escort was Brazilian,

00:25.155 --> 00:26.786
<i>I asked her to teach me
how to say a few things.</i>

00:26.789 --> 00:28.789
Far as Wozniak knows,
we were together all morning.

00:28.791 --> 00:32.826
Saperstein said he was with
Tufo when he spotted your guy.

00:33.628 --> 00:35.496
Why are you hiding the mail?

00:35.499 --> 00:37.531
<i>The man you're framing,
Miguel Zepeda,</i>

00:37.533 --> 00:40.399
<i>the paper trail
leads right back to you.</i>

00:40.402 --> 00:43.070
He threatened to kill me,
and I knew he would.

01:14.668 --> 01:17.603
It's been a long time.

01:17.605 --> 01:21.608
Guess I just
had to ask nicely.

01:21.609 --> 01:24.010
Then again,
you always took convincing.

01:24.013 --> 01:26.712
Why did you call me here,
Miguel?

01:26.715 --> 01:28.881
I need you
to find somebody.

01:28.882 --> 01:30.581
Frank Kovach.

01:30.584 --> 01:32.283
He did seven years
for assault and battery.

01:32.286 --> 01:33.819
He made parole
a few months ago.

01:33.820 --> 01:39.025
The word is, he was bragging
about killing some runaway girl.

01:39.027 --> 01:41.527
I think it's the same one
I got locked up for.

01:41.528 --> 01:43.528
A lot of runaways
meet a bad end.

01:43.531 --> 01:44.930
This guy Frank
knew details,

01:44.932 --> 01:48.332
things I only know
'cause I heard the testimonies.

01:48.335 --> 01:50.668
I'm tired
of serving his time.

01:50.670 --> 01:53.237
You're putting a lot of faith
in coincidence.

01:54.373 --> 01:57.209
For a long time, I thought
you had a hand in this,

01:57.210 --> 01:59.210
in putting me away.

01:59.212 --> 02:02.147
I did everything
I could back then.

02:02.149 --> 02:03.415
Look, we went a few rounds,

02:03.417 --> 02:06.918
but I know
you're not a murderer.

02:06.920 --> 02:09.454
I never thought
you were guilty.

02:11.591 --> 02:15.293
Have you told
our daughter that?

02:15.294 --> 02:18.695
She should also know
that I'm innocent of this,

02:18.698 --> 02:21.832
that I've changed.

02:21.835 --> 02:25.937
I'd like
to tell her that myself.

02:25.938 --> 02:28.573
Look, I'll think about it.

02:28.574 --> 02:31.575
What's good for you
could be really hard for her.

02:35.013 --> 02:37.981
Why didn't you have your
defense team contact the police?

02:37.984 --> 02:42.218
I don't trust lawyers,
and I don't trust the police.

02:42.221 --> 02:44.388
I only trust you.

02:44.389 --> 02:47.057
Or at least I did once.

02:49.026 --> 02:52.094
I'm hoping
I can still do that.

03:00.205 --> 03:04.007
So the abusive ex-boyfriend
we framed for murder

03:04.009 --> 03:05.275
calls you for a visit

03:05.276 --> 03:07.475
and you decide
that is a good idea?

03:07.478 --> 03:08.877
Look, his hearing's
coming up,

03:08.878 --> 03:10.929
and Nava doesn't even know
his defense yet.

03:11.014 --> 03:12.782
Now I do.

03:12.783 --> 03:14.516
This was a gift.

03:14.519 --> 03:16.451
A gift?
How is it a gift?

03:16.454 --> 03:18.687
A parolee named Frank Kovach

03:18.689 --> 03:20.222
bragged about a killing

03:20.223 --> 03:23.091
that sounds a lot like the one
we put Miguel away for.

03:23.092 --> 03:25.627
And he hasn't mentioned this
to anyone else?

03:25.628 --> 03:26.694
Why would he?

03:26.697 --> 03:31.299
He got railroaded last time,
and he knows it.

03:31.300 --> 03:35.937
But this isn't just about trying
to keep Miguel behind bars.

03:35.938 --> 03:37.504
I need to know.

03:37.507 --> 03:39.905
Why?
To assuage your conscience?

03:40.009 --> 03:42.175
There were no leads
on that case.

03:42.177 --> 03:44.211
That's why I used it.

03:44.213 --> 03:46.813
If this guy Kovach killed
this woman and got away with it,

03:46.816 --> 03:47.882
that's on me.

03:47.884 --> 03:50.817
Harlee,
stay away from this.

03:50.819 --> 03:52.286
That's an order.

03:52.288 --> 03:54.956
Wait two days.
Then send a message to Miguel.

03:54.957 --> 03:57.625
Tell him that you reached
a dead end.

03:57.627 --> 03:59.225
You're chasing ghosts, Harlee.

03:59.228 --> 04:01.876
We got flesh-and-blood
problems right here.

04:02.632 --> 04:04.330
What?

04:04.332 --> 04:05.766
You got a lead on our rat?

04:12.606 --> 04:15.175
I found it.

04:15.176 --> 04:18.778
Saperstein wasn't with Tufo
when he caught the tail.

04:18.781 --> 04:20.680
He lied to me.

04:20.682 --> 04:23.750
He was at some house
in Flatbush.

04:23.752 --> 04:27.620
Last night, he met a Fed
after hours,

04:27.622 --> 04:29.790
and he made a handoff.

04:29.792 --> 04:32.792
- How do you know it was Feds?
- I followed him.

04:32.793 --> 04:35.026
I watched him
betray us.

04:35.028 --> 04:38.329
He was smiling.
It was nothing for him.

04:38.331 --> 04:40.932
A few days ago, it was me
that you suspected.

04:40.935 --> 04:43.903
Loman killed an unarmed man.

04:43.904 --> 04:47.838
Tess is screwing up her
family life with Espada's help.

04:47.841 --> 04:50.675
Tufo thinks with his balls.

04:50.677 --> 04:53.744
It's just
the process of elimination.

04:53.745 --> 04:55.545
It's Saperstein.

04:55.548 --> 04:57.281
Hey, look, why don't you
just let me talk to him?

04:57.283 --> 04:58.749
- No! No.
- And I'll find out--

04:58.750 --> 05:00.084
I'm gonna handle him.

05:06.826 --> 05:08.658
Hey.
Got your message.

05:08.661 --> 05:11.394
Found the address.
Frank Kovach?

05:15.834 --> 05:17.401
Feel like
keeping me company?

05:17.403 --> 05:19.470
Sure.

05:26.077 --> 05:29.512
Is this a coincidence
or an ambush?

05:29.514 --> 05:32.115
I'm telling Joe what we did.
I thought you should know.

05:32.117 --> 05:34.250
Why would you do that?

05:34.252 --> 05:35.985
Because that was the point.

05:35.987 --> 05:37.420
He needs to know
what it feels like.

05:37.422 --> 05:40.255
Besides, if I don't come clean,
I'm just as bad as he is.

05:40.257 --> 05:41.590
And I'm not.

05:41.591 --> 05:42.725
This high road you walk

05:42.726 --> 05:44.226
is gonna end up
with me in traction.

05:44.228 --> 05:46.795
Oh, come on.
You carry a gun, Carlos.

05:46.797 --> 05:48.266
I'm trying to save my marriage.

05:48.399 --> 05:52.000
What do you think's
gonna happen, Tess, hmm?

05:52.002 --> 05:54.069
You're gonna come clean.

05:54.072 --> 05:55.502
You're gonna cry it out.

05:55.504 --> 05:57.471
And then what?

05:57.473 --> 05:59.348
You're gonna go back to your
spectacular relationship?

05:59.978 --> 06:01.944
Hmm?

06:06.949 --> 06:08.951
<i>Sap, I'm gonna
ask you something,</i>

06:08.952 --> 06:10.451
and I need you
to be straight with me.

06:10.454 --> 06:14.923
For the last time, Harlee,
I'm saving myself for marriage.

06:14.925 --> 06:17.725
Have you been skipping out
on the job lately?

06:17.726 --> 06:19.694
Is that a joke?

06:19.696 --> 06:21.362
I have a perfect
attendance certificate.

06:21.363 --> 06:22.697
Gold star and everything.

06:22.699 --> 06:24.432
Sap, if you tell me
what you've been doing,

06:24.434 --> 06:25.867
I can cover for you.

06:25.869 --> 06:28.401
Or you could stop
busting my balls.

06:28.403 --> 06:31.338
I'm not kidding.

06:31.339 --> 06:33.802
Where were you yesterday when
Tufo thought he caught a tail?

06:33.976 --> 06:36.610
Right next to him,
like he said.

06:36.612 --> 06:38.345
And last night?

06:38.346 --> 06:41.415
This line of questioning
end with a waterboard?

06:41.417 --> 06:42.983
Just trying
to help you out, Sap.

06:42.985 --> 06:45.418
Rumor has it
you've been ducking shifts.

06:45.420 --> 06:47.252
Rumor has it wrong.

06:47.254 --> 06:48.988
We gonna do this or not?

06:48.990 --> 06:50.956
Just cover me from out here.
I got it.

06:50.959 --> 06:52.024
What'd this guy Kovach do?

06:52.026 --> 06:53.560
He lost a bet to Wozniak.

06:53.562 --> 06:55.928
I'm supposed to bat my eyes
and suggest he make good.

07:01.670 --> 07:02.802
Hey, Woz.

07:02.803 --> 07:04.437
Saperstein, desk sergeant said

07:04.439 --> 07:06.072
you're running an errand
with Harlee?

07:06.074 --> 07:07.706
<i>Frank Kovach.
I don't know.</i>

07:07.709 --> 07:11.110
Some parolee.
She said you have some beef?

07:11.112 --> 07:12.411
<i>What address?</i>

07:12.413 --> 07:14.648
5722 Troutman.

07:14.649 --> 07:16.882
All right, I'm gonna be there
in 25 minutes.

07:16.884 --> 07:18.651
Don't go anywhere, you hear me?

07:28.995 --> 07:31.863
I'm really hoping
this is a strip-o-gram.

07:32.867 --> 07:34.033
Frank Kovach?

07:34.034 --> 07:37.334
Harlee Santos, NYPD.

07:37.336 --> 07:39.470
Got time for a few questions?

07:39.471 --> 07:41.872
Now that my hopes
are dashed, sure.

07:41.875 --> 07:43.040
This is a little awkward.

07:43.043 --> 07:45.076
There's an inmate at Rikers

07:45.077 --> 07:46.896
looking for
a second chance at life.

07:46.946 --> 07:48.278
He was put away
for the murder

07:48.281 --> 07:50.581
of a 19-year-old runaway
named Rita Martin.

07:50.584 --> 07:52.582
Never heard of her.

07:52.584 --> 07:55.218
Yeah, I'm not surprised.

07:55.220 --> 07:56.786
I talked to your
parole officer,

07:56.788 --> 07:59.757
and he said you're really
looking to turn over a new leaf.

07:59.759 --> 08:01.858
I would hate
for anything to jeopardize--

08:01.860 --> 08:04.093
What's his name?

08:04.096 --> 08:06.529
- Miguel Zepeda.
- No, my parole officer.

08:06.531 --> 08:10.298
You said you talked to him.
What's his name?

08:10.300 --> 08:11.666
Yeah.

08:11.668 --> 08:14.202
o, I-- I'm sorry.
I can't help you.

08:17.108 --> 08:19.042
You don't want
to do this, Frank.

08:23.834 --> 08:25.459
Easy.
You're okay.

08:25.586 --> 08:27.101
Doorframe kept him
from winding up too much.

08:27.223 --> 08:29.019
Feels like
he wound up plenty.

08:29.136 --> 08:30.319
Guy took off out the back.

08:30.396 --> 08:31.759
We'll get after him
once Woz gets here.

08:32.926 --> 08:34.485
How does Woz
know where we are?

08:34.600 --> 08:35.865
He just called.
He sounded pissed.

08:35.958 --> 08:37.635
He said he'd be here in 25.

08:41.066 --> 08:43.477
- Yeah?
- How far are you from Red Hook?

08:43.591 --> 08:44.663
<i>Around the corner.</i>

08:45.534 --> 08:49.546
Look, Wozniak's convinced
that Saperstein's the mole.

08:49.739 --> 08:51.383
He's on his way
to interrogate him.

08:51.482 --> 08:54.269
I got a pretty good idea
how that ends.

08:54.501 --> 08:56.595
Harlee, then you convince him
he's wrong.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.201
It's too late for that.

08:58.317 --> 09:00.234
He's already ruled out
everybody else.

09:00.344 --> 09:02.384
If I don't get him
out of here now,

09:02.490 --> 09:05.022
I might not get another chance.

09:06.453 --> 09:08.043
You have to arrest him.

09:08.169 --> 09:09.764
<i>What's Wozniak's ETA?</i>

09:10.173 --> 09:11.462
<i>- 20 minutes.
- All right.</i>

09:11.544 --> 09:13.303
<i>Well, I'm closer than that,
so you text me the address</i>

09:13.379 --> 09:14.504
<i>and you get out of there,
all right?</i>

09:14.581 --> 09:15.777
I'm not leaving him.

09:15.881 --> 09:17.548
<i>Well, you can't look
connected to this, Harlee.</i>

09:17.654 --> 09:19.649
Trust me.
I will be there, I promise.

09:19.732 --> 09:21.081
Just go.

09:26.368 --> 09:27.827
Tell Wozniak
I went back to the precinct

09:27.919 --> 09:29.706
to chew on some pain meds.

09:29.802 --> 09:31.443
Maybe somebody
should come get you.

09:31.528 --> 09:32.696
No, I'm fine.

09:34.965 --> 09:38.288
Look, I'm sorry that I was
riding you in the car.

09:42.820 --> 09:44.591
You're one
of the good ones, Sap.

09:52.394 --> 09:53.924
You're funny.

10:10.721 --> 10:12.277
- Hi.
- Where's Mikey?

10:12.360 --> 10:13.624
Jimmy's.

10:14.720 --> 10:15.922
You know, the little
snag-toothed redhead,

10:16.004 --> 10:17.557
just moved in
down the street?

10:23.754 --> 10:25.184
You know where the opener went?

10:25.264 --> 10:26.697
Dishwasher.

10:29.056 --> 10:30.581
Who was the woman?

10:30.952 --> 10:32.298
With the yoga pants.

10:32.442 --> 10:34.061
Angie,

10:34.413 --> 10:35.754
Jimmy's mom.

10:35.850 --> 10:37.558
Why?
What'd I do wrong this time?

10:38.411 --> 10:39.972
This time,
you cheated on me.

10:40.057 --> 10:41.486
We were talking
about our kids.

10:41.566 --> 10:44.091
Not her,
the bartender.

10:44.350 --> 10:45.351
Don't make me
drag it out of you.

10:45.436 --> 10:47.148
We've been together too long.

10:47.244 --> 10:48.484
Look, this girl
was texting me--

10:48.567 --> 10:52.182
No, no, no, no, no.
She told me everything.

10:55.249 --> 10:56.210
You know,
I bend over backwards

10:56.288 --> 10:58.441
trying to be
everything you want,

10:58.796 --> 11:01.962
but the one thing I can't be
is young again, Joe.

11:02.187 --> 11:04.017
I don't need you to be.

11:04.684 --> 11:06.020
Listen...

11:07.568 --> 11:10.383
it wa--
it was stupid.

11:10.787 --> 11:12.119
I was feeling old...

11:13.303 --> 11:14.245
midlife crisis.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.043
I don't know.
Call it what you want.

11:17.119 --> 11:18.417
It's done.

11:18.940 --> 11:19.730
- No, no, no.
- No, no, come on. Baby.

11:19.815 --> 11:20.856
- Get your hands off of me.
- Hey, hey.

11:20.947 --> 11:22.458
- Joe, no! No!
- No, no. Hey, hey.

11:22.518 --> 11:23.818
- Get off me, Joe.
- Hey, hey, baby.

11:23.888 --> 11:25.456
- No.
- I'm sorry.

11:38.482 --> 11:40.192
Okay.
Okay.

11:40.286 --> 11:42.474
What's this about, hmm?
Some kind of hazing?

11:42.563 --> 11:43.558
Internal Affairs wrapped up

11:43.636 --> 11:45.344
their investigation
of your shooting.

11:45.437 --> 11:46.799
No more anonymity.

11:46.898 --> 11:49.495
Your name was just released as
the shooter of Jamarr Malcolm.

11:49.568 --> 11:50.441
"Times" ran it.

11:50.514 --> 11:53.220
I mean, it's pretty deep,
but, you know, word gets around.

11:53.293 --> 11:55.138
Bullets are a tradition.

11:55.253 --> 11:56.774
It's a show of solidarity.

11:56.841 --> 11:57.970
You ain't gonna be
the most popular cop

11:58.068 --> 11:59.475
on the street for a minute.

11:59.557 --> 12:00.826
Then again,
no one's gonna resist an arrest

12:00.889 --> 12:02.190
from Detective Loman.

12:02.268 --> 12:02.955
Guys, come on.

12:03.024 --> 12:04.732
This is not exactly
the reputation I was going for.

12:04.832 --> 12:07.500
Anybody bothers you,
you let us know.

12:09.356 --> 12:11.621
Your friends and loved ones
know who you are.

12:12.116 --> 12:13.957
That's all that matters.

12:20.480 --> 12:23.327
Harlee, Saperstein called,
told us about this Kovach guy.

12:23.413 --> 12:24.817
Forget about Kovach.

12:24.897 --> 12:26.784
This was a personal favor
for Wozniak.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.187
- Guy owed him some cash.
- Guy also drew blood.

12:29.298 --> 12:30.946
Somebody cracks you
on the head,

12:31.022 --> 12:32.413
it's all of our business,
Harlee.

12:33.768 --> 12:34.667
I'm fine.

12:34.769 --> 12:36.309
This Kovach guy
did seven years

12:36.394 --> 12:38.667
for domestic assault
and battery,

12:38.830 --> 12:40.860
left an ex-wife and a son
on the outside.

12:40.951 --> 12:41.726
Soon as he got released,

12:41.825 --> 12:43.523
he starts making
unscheduled visits.

12:43.709 --> 12:45.061
Ex-wife took out
a restraining order

12:45.144 --> 12:46.727
to protect her kid.

12:48.027 --> 12:50.586
Thank you, really.

12:50.804 --> 12:52.506
I'll go talk to the ex-wife.

12:52.614 --> 12:54.505
But please,
keep this to yourselves.

12:58.556 --> 13:01.316
She didn't stick around to
hear about Kovach's girlfriend.

13:01.793 --> 13:04.511
Oops.
Guess she's our problem.

13:04.596 --> 13:05.330
Hey, it's me.

13:05.434 --> 13:07.597
Listen,
I know you're at work, but...

13:07.837 --> 13:09.000
I need to talk to you.

13:10.038 --> 13:12.471
Saddle up, tenderfoot.
We're going for a drive.

13:16.091 --> 13:18.184
Come on, just help me find
the permission slip.

13:18.270 --> 13:20.903
You sure she signed it?
We got to get back before fifth.

13:21.019 --> 13:22.629
Yeah, no,
she knew the trip was Friday.

13:22.698 --> 13:24.710
It's got to be around here
somewhere.

13:25.320 --> 13:26.624
You see it up there?

13:26.873 --> 13:30.774
No, but there's a letter
addressed to you from a prison.

13:36.533 --> 13:37.238
Listen to me,

13:37.341 --> 13:39.346
this is the third time
that I've called now.

13:39.448 --> 13:41.062
I can't wait anymore.

13:42.209 --> 13:44.144
That's Wozniak.

13:45.143 --> 13:47.312
My potential threat
just became a reality,

13:47.424 --> 13:48.971
so you either pull Baker
out of that meeting,

13:49.070 --> 13:50.293
or you get me Sweeney.

13:50.418 --> 13:52.355
Easier to ask forgiveness.
We'll get him out the back.

13:52.455 --> 13:53.225
All right, never mind.

13:53.309 --> 13:54.702
Tell her I'm making
a command decision.

14:34.328 --> 14:36.283
Don't move.
FBI.

14:48.245 --> 14:49.572
Harlee?

14:52.221 --> 14:53.400
Saperstein?

14:53.517 --> 14:55.192
Don't.

14:55.753 --> 14:56.936
Trust me.

14:59.154 --> 15:00.660
Hello?

15:02.808 --> 15:04.022
Sap?

15:09.471 --> 15:11.562
Sap?
Harlee?

15:18.713 --> 15:21.440
Are we playing hide-and-seek,
Saperstein?

15:25.631 --> 15:27.291
_

15:31.528 --> 15:33.751
"Trust me" doesn't usually
end in handcuffs.

15:34.405 --> 15:35.379
I want a lawyer.

15:35.456 --> 15:36.980
Lieutenant Wozniak thinks
you're working with us.

15:37.072 --> 15:38.639
He was on his way
to question you.

15:38.720 --> 15:41.955
And by question you,
we mean shoot you in the head.

15:42.032 --> 15:43.767
Look, what are you
arresting me for?

15:44.171 --> 15:47.054
Fraud, extortion,
misconduct.

15:47.176 --> 15:48.351
We're taking you
to a safe house.

15:48.442 --> 15:49.780
Once we've completed
our investigation,

15:49.888 --> 15:51.500
you'll be given
the opportunity to testify

15:51.599 --> 15:53.061
in exchange for immunity.

15:53.179 --> 15:54.602
That's not gonna happen.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.235
Good choice, Detective.

15:56.318 --> 15:59.158
Your mother looks able-bodied
enough to visit you in prison.

16:01.120 --> 16:03.517
- I need to talk to her.
- No.

16:03.631 --> 16:05.335
If I disappear
to a safe house, it'll kill her.

16:05.418 --> 16:07.830
You want me to even consider
testifying against my friends,

16:07.937 --> 16:09.667
I talk to my mother.

16:10.515 --> 16:12.090
That's the deal.

16:13.724 --> 16:16.010
Well, let's go see Mom.

16:24.274 --> 16:25.943
Heard they pulled
this dude's permits.

16:26.337 --> 16:28.642
Here's hoping
the port-a-john still works.

16:28.841 --> 16:30.457
Are we sure this parolee's
girlfriend is even here?

16:30.575 --> 16:32.937
Works security.
Harlee's checking his ex-wife.

16:33.044 --> 16:33.999
If you hit a cop,
who would you run to,

16:34.096 --> 16:35.518
your ex-wife
or your girlfriend?

16:35.678 --> 16:37.495
Y'all need me, holler.

16:42.240 --> 16:44.801
Tiffany Harris?
Detective Espada.

16:44.897 --> 16:46.048
This is private property.

16:46.126 --> 16:47.466
You got a problem,
you can call the owner.

16:47.561 --> 16:49.164
Ma'am, have you heard
from Frank Kovach today?

16:50.894 --> 16:52.120
Wouldn't tell you if I did.

16:52.184 --> 16:53.609
You mind
if we take a look around?

16:53.677 --> 16:55.542
Not if you've got a warrant.

16:59.835 --> 17:01.971
That wouldn't be a crack rock
in there, would it?

17:04.567 --> 17:05.829
If he's not here,
then where is he?

17:05.938 --> 17:07.313
I don't know, okay?

17:07.943 --> 17:09.781
Ma'am if that's true, you mind
if I look in your phone?

17:09.884 --> 17:11.679
Don't scroll
through the pictures.

17:11.989 --> 17:13.290
I didn't know
you two were engaged.

17:13.397 --> 17:15.483
That must be
a whole 1/10 of a carat.

17:16.383 --> 17:17.982
Five outgoing calls
to Frank Kovach

17:18.069 --> 17:18.883
that weren't returned.

17:18.976 --> 17:20.064
No incoming calls,
no texts.

17:20.165 --> 17:21.771
Maybe he used
the desk phone.

17:21.877 --> 17:23.721
Then why didn't he pick up
when she called back?

17:24.759 --> 17:27.290
You're gonna stay put
until you hear from us again.

17:27.384 --> 17:30.464
And if you behave,
we'll let you keep your phone.

17:36.755 --> 17:38.615
And if you leave,

17:38.856 --> 17:41.272
you're gonna get arrested
for having a real crack rock,

17:41.385 --> 17:43.115
which I'm gonna come back with.

17:43.221 --> 17:44.864
Comprendes?

17:45.546 --> 17:46.493
Come on.

17:49.471 --> 17:50.933
- What'd you get?
- Nothing.

17:51.106 --> 17:53.449
But I'm about to get a lecture
from our resident Boy Scout.

17:53.597 --> 17:55.285
Yo, yo, yo,
you can't do that.

17:55.726 --> 17:57.767
This guy hurt Harlee,
all right?

17:57.869 --> 17:59.094
We don't need admissible.

17:59.183 --> 18:00.510
We need right now.

18:00.926 --> 18:02.273
I got to make a stop.

18:05.107 --> 18:08.328
Mrs. Kovach.
NYPD.

18:08.500 --> 18:10.691
We're looking
for your ex-husband, Frank.

18:17.138 --> 18:19.171
- Where's Saperstein?
- I left him at Kovach's house.

18:19.246 --> 18:20.150
He's not there,

18:20.242 --> 18:21.634
and you should have never
been there in the first place.

18:21.708 --> 18:23.131
I told you not to go.

18:23.625 --> 18:24.978
I had to know.

18:25.215 --> 18:27.929
Tufo and Espada
are chasing leads, Harlee.

18:28.198 --> 18:30.718
They just think it's some guy
who owes you money.

18:31.126 --> 18:32.847
Look, Miguel might be right.

18:33.567 --> 18:36.217
This guy Kovach,
he killed Rita Martin.

18:36.322 --> 18:38.720
Great, you and I can trade
places with Miguel in prison.

18:38.806 --> 18:39.771
You like that?

19:00.398 --> 19:01.717
Did your ex do this?

19:02.257 --> 19:04.395
He made me call the school,

19:04.510 --> 19:06.453
give permission
to pick Brian up.

19:06.538 --> 19:08.044
He's taking him away from me.

19:08.381 --> 19:10.876
- What school?
- PS 257.

19:10.990 --> 19:12.674
He has a gun!

19:12.929 --> 19:14.558
It's okay.
Look at me.

19:15.042 --> 19:16.307
We're gonna get your son.

19:21.538 --> 19:23.284
Sweetie,
this is a really bad time.

19:23.391 --> 19:24.172
What, for you to talk

19:24.300 --> 19:27.006
or for you to tell me
who my father is?

19:27.280 --> 19:29.183
<i>Look, I found the letter
on your dresser,</i>

19:29.351 --> 19:31.101
the one addressed to me?

19:31.259 --> 19:33.467
Cristina, I'm sorry.

19:34.141 --> 19:36.480
You told me
he didn't care about me,

19:36.999 --> 19:38.615
that he was just
some random jerk

19:38.717 --> 19:40.549
who didn't want to be a dad.

19:40.671 --> 19:42.795
<i>- He is.
- Then why is he writing me?</i>

19:45.915 --> 19:48.199
The man that's writing you
is not your father.

19:48.479 --> 19:50.298
<i>Look, just please
let me explain.</i>

19:50.667 --> 19:53.134
You know, just don't--
don't bother.

19:53.447 --> 19:55.653
I'm gonna give him
a crack at it.

20:02.583 --> 20:04.016
You all right?

20:06.137 --> 20:08.718
Cristina's
going to see Miguel.

20:10.924 --> 20:12.842
She found a letter he wrote her.

20:13.654 --> 20:15.375
Go.
Come on, I'll handle this.

20:15.451 --> 20:17.085
Go on.

20:19.269 --> 20:20.672
Mom?

20:22.823 --> 20:24.494
- Mom?
- Hey.

20:24.568 --> 20:26.328
Just-- just stay
where we can see you.

20:26.611 --> 20:29.241
She's got book club today.
She should be back.

20:29.339 --> 20:30.424
If she's not here
in 15 minutes,

20:30.505 --> 20:32.515
you call her
from the road, okay?

20:33.336 --> 20:34.559
Go pack what you need.

20:36.594 --> 20:37.835
Stahl.

20:40.028 --> 20:42.167
15 minutes?

20:43.002 --> 20:44.451
What would you take?

20:45.355 --> 20:46.770
A few changes of clothes.

20:46.845 --> 20:48.441
No, I'm not asking
what you would suggest.

20:48.535 --> 20:49.661
I'm asking,
what you would take

20:49.759 --> 20:51.086
if somebody walked
into your life

20:51.189 --> 20:53.569
and said they were gonna
strip you out of it?

20:53.987 --> 20:56.157
We're the good guys,
Detective.

20:58.748 --> 21:00.232
How's it feel

21:00.432 --> 21:01.999
being the good guys?

21:02.728 --> 21:03.856
Hey, I got your message.

21:03.922 --> 21:05.433
I was gonna call you
as soon as I got off work.

21:05.626 --> 21:07.308
Is there somewhere
we can talk?

21:07.568 --> 21:08.901
I can't.
I just got off my break.

21:08.971 --> 21:11.250
Erica, it's very important.

21:12.402 --> 21:13.874
Okay, what is it?
What's going on?

21:15.556 --> 21:17.349
I, uh--

21:20.692 --> 21:22.011
Look, I'm so sorry.

21:22.108 --> 21:23.287
I really
only have a second.

21:23.356 --> 21:25.347
- It's not easy for me.
- Okay.

21:25.488 --> 21:27.392
I don't expect you
to understand.

21:30.423 --> 21:32.423
Maybe-- maybe later is better.

21:32.576 --> 21:33.865
Yeah, meet me
at Jay-Jay's practice.

21:33.947 --> 21:34.904
We can talk then, okay?

21:34.992 --> 21:36.491
- Okay.
- Okay.

21:38.461 --> 21:40.315
Sorry, Mr. Nieves.

21:42.199 --> 21:44.255
What part of honk
don't you understand?

21:44.356 --> 21:46.307
- You couldn't give me a minute?
- No, Loman.

21:46.367 --> 21:48.808
Frank Kovach
might be kidnapping his son.

21:52.458 --> 21:53.391
Did the school get notified?

21:53.501 --> 21:55.462
Wozniak wants this
handled quietly.

21:55.588 --> 21:57.719
Kovach is a white dude.
5'11", dark hair.

21:57.801 --> 21:58.674
Son's name is Brian.

21:58.759 --> 22:00.127
- Whoa, he drive a truck?
- How'd you know?

22:00.244 --> 22:02.252
He just slammed Brian into it.

22:02.492 --> 22:03.877
- Hey!
- Police! Stop!

22:03.969 --> 22:05.088
Stop the car!

22:05.589 --> 22:06.648
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:06.727 --> 22:08.694
Stop! Police! Kovach!
Kovach, just stop!

22:09.442 --> 22:11.076
Kovach, freeze!

22:11.140 --> 22:12.294
Police! Stop!

22:15.912 --> 22:17.519
Ow, what is that,
battery acid?

22:17.625 --> 22:19.163
You want me
I've come to fetch your dolly?

22:19.567 --> 22:20.946
I just got hit by a car, bro.

22:23.714 --> 22:25.904
Excuse me, I need to talk
to these guys for a minute.

22:26.741 --> 22:30.299
Kovach's rent-a-cop girlfriend,
is she decent leverage?

22:30.444 --> 22:32.483
This guy's got to be broke.

22:32.589 --> 22:34.140
But he sprung
for an engagement ring.

22:34.256 --> 22:36.579
- I'd say he's smitten.
- All right, good.

22:36.666 --> 22:38.740
Kidnapped kid, maimed cop--

22:38.816 --> 22:40.615
every agency in the city's
gonna be put on notice.

22:40.708 --> 22:42.192
I want to handle this
discreetly.

22:42.271 --> 22:43.997
Is she at
the construction site now?

22:44.160 --> 22:47.394
I made sure of it.
Her phone is in the glove box.

22:47.469 --> 22:48.693
What's the play?

22:48.782 --> 22:50.165
A little black op.

22:50.252 --> 22:51.501
Yeah, my favorite kind.

22:51.756 --> 22:53.441
- Does this hurt?
- Ah!

22:53.523 --> 22:55.586
Ah, what the...

22:58.179 --> 23:00.933
I'm gonna get a beer.
You want anything?

23:06.789 --> 23:08.442
I cheated on you too.

23:09.432 --> 23:10.864
What's that?

23:11.492 --> 23:12.971
Nothing.

23:20.165 --> 23:23.118
<i>â™ª</i>

23:26.826 --> 23:29.377
David,
who are these people?

23:29.527 --> 23:32.607
They're... friends, Ma.

23:33.861 --> 23:35.601
I know your friends.

23:36.269 --> 23:37.613
I got some new ones.

23:42.130 --> 23:43.645
Sit down, Mom.

23:43.970 --> 23:45.112
Who is that man,

23:45.195 --> 23:47.942
telling you to hurry
with your own mother?

23:48.115 --> 23:49.488
Listen to me.

23:50.365 --> 23:52.868
I'm gonna have
to go away for a while.

23:53.472 --> 23:54.951
What are you saying?

23:55.068 --> 23:56.163
David, are you
in trouble?

23:56.241 --> 23:58.990
No, it's work.
It's a-- it's a big case.

23:59.118 --> 24:01.779
I-- I'm the guy
they want on it.

24:02.183 --> 24:03.691
You don't do big cases.

24:03.780 --> 24:05.116
You're a neighborhood policeman.

24:05.219 --> 24:06.839
You come home after your shift.

24:06.919 --> 24:08.756
Listen.
Look at me, Mom.

24:09.294 --> 24:11.234
You'll be fine.

24:12.173 --> 24:14.769
I need you
to know that, okay?

24:15.705 --> 24:17.695
I don't like this, David.

24:17.830 --> 24:19.529
You're acting strange.

24:19.931 --> 24:22.624
- You're lying to me.
- I'm sorry.

24:23.394 --> 24:26.996
I love you.
I'm so sorry.

24:32.750 --> 24:34.278
Hey, Ma,

24:34.508 --> 24:36.443
how's your blood sugar been?

24:41.822 --> 24:43.357
Christina.

24:44.272 --> 24:46.704
They won't let me in
without parental consent.

24:47.240 --> 24:48.343
Think you can handle that?

24:48.442 --> 24:50.138
Look, just
hear me out first.

24:50.217 --> 24:52.185
You've had 16 years.

24:52.711 --> 24:55.557
You couldn't find a time
before now to tell me the truth?

24:55.884 --> 24:58.284
I have told you
the truth, always.

24:58.374 --> 25:00.693
Your truth doesn't make
any sense.

25:04.778 --> 25:08.523
Miguel Zepeda was my boyfriend
when I got pregnant.

25:08.828 --> 25:11.349
But he's not your father.

25:13.347 --> 25:15.155
You're old enough now
to understand

25:15.257 --> 25:18.078
that that was a hard thing
for me to tell you.

25:19.795 --> 25:23.730
Look, I'm not here to try
to stop you from seeing him.

25:25.318 --> 25:28.336
I'm just asking
that you let me explain.

25:31.634 --> 25:33.432
You'll tell me everything?

25:34.662 --> 25:36.352
Everything.

25:37.753 --> 25:39.493
Just come home.

25:40.857 --> 25:43.099
All I want to do
is prepare you

25:43.179 --> 25:46.066
for what's on the other side
of those doors.

25:48.470 --> 25:50.572
Okay.

25:51.714 --> 25:53.142
Go wash away
those tears, okay?

25:53.258 --> 25:55.064
- Okay.
- I'll be right out.

26:10.643 --> 26:12.137
How can I help you,
Detective?

26:12.417 --> 26:13.265
I'm her mother.

26:13.356 --> 26:15.201
I need you to make
a note in the system.

26:15.461 --> 26:17.842
Under no circumstances
does Cristina Santos

26:17.986 --> 26:20.733
have permission
to visit with Miguel Zepeda.

26:20.892 --> 26:22.251
Yes, ma'am.

26:26.021 --> 26:28.166
- You good?
- No, and neither is she.

26:28.251 --> 26:29.432
I need to get
her heart medication.

26:29.506 --> 26:30.846
Hey.
Easy.

26:30.911 --> 26:32.762
She's having heart
palpitations down there.

26:32.855 --> 26:34.349
All right, go check it out.

26:35.041 --> 26:36.372
What's she got?

26:36.961 --> 26:38.535
Coronary heart disease

26:38.663 --> 26:41.046
caused by diabetes.

26:45.968 --> 26:49.401
Don't. Trust me.

27:16.170 --> 27:17.436
Who the hell are you?

27:17.507 --> 27:18.830
I'm the best chance
your boyfriend's got

27:18.919 --> 27:20.690
at staying out of jail.

27:22.290 --> 27:24.009
If I were you,

27:24.126 --> 27:27.476
I'd be on
my best behavior.

27:27.925 --> 27:29.484
Frankenstein,

27:29.574 --> 27:30.824
my man.

27:30.934 --> 27:33.722
Yeah, I'm here with
your fiancÃ©e, Tiffany.

27:35.246 --> 27:37.708
Listen to him, Frank,
please.

27:38.223 --> 27:41.778
Yeah, stealing a kid,
running over a cop...

27:41.980 --> 27:45.253
those are things that get you
sent back to prison, Frank.

27:45.700 --> 27:47.006
A cop?
Hell no, I hate cops.

27:47.094 --> 27:49.180
I'm a friend
of your ex-wife's.

27:49.305 --> 27:50.628
And I'ma give you
some money

27:50.723 --> 27:52.586
and a fresh car
to disappear in.

27:52.667 --> 27:54.519
But first things
first, Frank.

27:55.279 --> 27:57.388
You're gonna need
to bring me that kid.

28:15.605 --> 28:17.365
Hey.

28:18.628 --> 28:20.372
You shouldn't be here.

28:21.696 --> 28:23.304
I decided
I couldn't miss it.

28:23.672 --> 28:25.425
You made my mother cry.

28:26.707 --> 28:28.143
Jay-Jay, look,
I'm sorry about that, okay?

28:28.215 --> 28:28.587
I just--

28:28.694 --> 28:29.885
You also said
you were my friend.

28:29.963 --> 28:31.205
Look, I know this is hard
to understand.

28:31.288 --> 28:32.212
If you just calm down--

28:32.279 --> 28:33.741
You killed my cousin!

28:33.849 --> 28:35.519
It was in the newspaper.

28:35.835 --> 28:37.510
It's a mistake. It was--
If you give me a chance to--

28:42.125 --> 28:43.686
Get out of here!

28:45.622 --> 28:46.874
Get out!

29:14.184 --> 29:16.173
Hey.
Tufo called.

29:16.313 --> 29:17.932
Kovach is on his way
to the construction site.

29:18.009 --> 29:19.557
He's willing to trade his kid
for the girlfriend,

29:19.660 --> 29:21.218
a car, and some cash.

29:23.575 --> 29:25.508
Woz, why don't we just
call SWAT on this loser?

29:26.497 --> 29:28.720
Sins of the past.

29:28.939 --> 29:30.747
He always wanted a dog.

29:30.849 --> 29:32.416
Maybe he went
to the pet store.

29:32.499 --> 29:33.980
Mrs. Saperstein,
this is important.

29:34.067 --> 29:35.512
Does he have any friends
outside of work,

29:35.628 --> 29:37.230
other relatives
here in the city?

29:37.302 --> 29:38.892
He has me.

29:39.444 --> 29:40.653
Mrs. Saperstein,
are you familiar

29:40.766 --> 29:42.583
with the concept
of aiding and abetting?

29:42.685 --> 29:44.732
This is pointless.
We need to find him.

29:47.692 --> 29:50.000
- He's gonna lay low.
- Best-case scenario.

29:50.087 --> 29:51.785
Worst-case scenario,
he contacts Wozniak.

29:51.868 --> 29:52.770
He won't risk using his phone,

29:52.864 --> 29:53.927
which means
he'll do it in person.

29:54.011 --> 29:56.108
If we surveil Wozniak
and Saperstein shows up,

29:56.207 --> 29:57.907
we're not gonna have any choice
but to intervene.

29:58.010 --> 29:58.897
Operation over.

29:58.977 --> 30:00.284
So, what, we go back
to questioning Mom?

30:00.373 --> 30:02.730
No.
We put out a federal warrant.

30:02.806 --> 30:03.929
His crew
sees a Fed warrant,

30:04.013 --> 30:05.238
he might as well
have a target on his back.

30:05.325 --> 30:06.306
He already does.

30:06.380 --> 30:07.190
At least this way,
his crew's

30:07.256 --> 30:09.135
not the only ones
looking for him.

30:09.836 --> 30:10.967
Blow him up.

30:11.721 --> 30:13.505
Man, could he make me laugh.

30:14.604 --> 30:17.374
He was, like, charismatic,

30:18.612 --> 30:20.170
and handsome.

30:22.832 --> 30:25.556
And I don't know;
he made me feel special.

30:26.480 --> 30:28.025
And that wasn't something
a lot of people

30:28.133 --> 30:30.682
made me feel back then.

30:34.146 --> 30:36.041
Those are all the letters
he wrote me?

30:36.447 --> 30:37.798
Yeah.

30:39.654 --> 30:40.924
There's a lot of them.

30:44.250 --> 30:47.818
I don't know; shouldn't I
at least write him back?

30:48.637 --> 30:50.724
I guess that's gonna be
up to you.

30:50.915 --> 30:53.614
You know, these letters
are yours now, if you want them.

30:58.094 --> 31:00.843
But there's something
that I need you to see first.

31:19.123 --> 31:21.186
He did this to you?

31:22.086 --> 31:23.336
When?

31:24.894 --> 31:26.080
That time?

31:26.949 --> 31:28.957
Couple years
before you were born.

31:32.030 --> 31:33.957
Why didn't you leave him?

31:36.567 --> 31:38.996
I think I didn't want
to be alone.

31:40.052 --> 31:41.704
Then I met someone,

31:42.738 --> 31:45.297
and I saw a chance
at a better life

31:45.414 --> 31:47.359
with a better man
than Miguel.

31:48.210 --> 31:49.505
My dad.

31:51.944 --> 31:53.851
I wanted him to be.

31:56.288 --> 31:59.718
But when he found out
I was pregnant, he took off.

32:01.876 --> 32:03.757
And I tried to tell Miguel
the truth,

32:03.855 --> 32:07.904
but he didn't want to believe
that you weren't his.

32:10.354 --> 32:12.490
And things got scary again.

32:16.637 --> 32:19.493
Baby, don't--
don't cry, okay?

32:20.132 --> 32:22.919
This doesn't--
this doesn't hurt me anymore,

32:23.361 --> 32:24.419
all right?

32:24.567 --> 32:25.464
It just--

32:26.224 --> 32:29.068
it just reminds me
of how strong I've become.

32:36.385 --> 32:38.672
I don't think
I need these anymore.

33:05.685 --> 33:07.547
Hey, traffic cop
is looking for Woz,

33:07.642 --> 33:09.200
said that there was a CI
waiting for him.

33:09.292 --> 33:10.173
This some kind of prank?

33:10.247 --> 33:11.684
I can't use my cell phone.
None of us should.

33:11.759 --> 33:13.605
- They could be listening.
- Sap, what is this car, man?

33:13.711 --> 33:15.258
This is my mother's.
I'm in a lot of trouble, Tess.

33:15.340 --> 33:17.300
- I need to talk to Wozniak.
- In what kind of trouble?

33:17.378 --> 33:18.327
Please.
I don't have time.

33:18.406 --> 33:20.786
Okay, he's on his way to that
construction site on Iverson.

33:20.871 --> 33:23.465
He's baiting the hook for
that dick who ran over Espada.

33:23.582 --> 33:25.761
- Where have you been?
- Step away from the car, Tess.

33:25.848 --> 33:26.967
Sap, what's going on here?
You're shaking.

33:27.037 --> 33:28.386
Step away now.

33:30.933 --> 33:32.320
Was that
Detective Saperstein?

33:32.413 --> 33:33.847
Not the one I know.
Why?

33:33.926 --> 33:36.050
FBI put a warrant out
for his arrest.

33:40.201 --> 33:41.561
He's here.

33:41.952 --> 33:43.930
I told him he had to meet you
up on the fourth floor.

33:43.999 --> 33:45.865
Get him isolated.
Where are you?

33:45.970 --> 33:47.750
Five minutes.
Did he bring the kid?

33:47.932 --> 33:50.119
Yeah, and a piece
tucked into his belt.

33:50.302 --> 33:51.527
Are you sure you want to do it
like this?

33:51.597 --> 33:52.534
We've got to.

33:52.686 --> 33:53.720
<i>For Detective
David Saperstein</i>

33:53.807 --> 33:55.471
<i>of the 64th precinct.</i>

33:55.583 --> 33:59.185
<i>Repeat, a federal warrant
is issued for David Saperstein.</i>

33:59.364 --> 34:00.467
Woz, you still there?

34:00.551 --> 34:02.451
<i>Armed and should be
considered dangerous.</i>

34:30.568 --> 34:32.268
Hey, Saperstein just showed up
at the precinct

34:32.396 --> 34:33.434
looking for Wozniak.

34:33.539 --> 34:35.646
- And he was jumpy as hell.
- Hey, slow down, Tess.

34:35.735 --> 34:37.998
There is a federal
arrest warrant out for him.

34:38.146 --> 34:39.724
We could all be
in big trouble.

34:39.831 --> 34:41.474
- Where's Sap now?
- He's on his way to Wozniak.

34:41.577 --> 34:44.170
I had no idea there was an APB
on him until after.

34:44.251 --> 34:45.875
I told him right where to go.

34:46.190 --> 34:48.393
Okay, uh, did you call Woz?

34:48.501 --> 34:50.418
No, Sap said we shouldn't
use our phones.

34:50.485 --> 34:51.922
Why not?

34:52.090 --> 34:53.329
Oh, department
isn't allowing

34:53.445 --> 34:55.559
personal calls
on company minutes.

34:56.023 --> 34:56.802
Next thing you know,

34:56.893 --> 34:59.065
we're gonna have
to pay for our own gas.

34:59.403 --> 35:00.956
Look, Aunt Tess
has a flat tire.

35:01.036 --> 35:03.382
So do you mind
if I go help her change it?

35:03.489 --> 35:05.340
- Okay.
- I'm gonna wait outside.

35:06.016 --> 35:07.353
Bye.

35:08.525 --> 35:09.992
You sure this is okay?

35:10.070 --> 35:11.842
Yeah, yeah, I'm just gonna
practice a little bit,

35:11.905 --> 35:13.181
maybe take a nap.

35:28.951 --> 35:30.420
<i>This is David.
Make it snappy.</i>

35:30.503 --> 35:32.273
Sap, this is Harlee.

35:32.384 --> 35:34.014
Look, I know you got picked up
by the Feds.

35:34.195 --> 35:36.313
I told them to.

35:36.731 --> 35:37.849
I know you're scared,

35:38.018 --> 35:40.797
but I need you to sit tight
and call me.

35:41.226 --> 35:45.322
<i>And whatever you do,
do not go to Wozniak.</i>

35:55.585 --> 35:58.362
Harlee, I can't go to jail.
I can't. My kids need me.

35:58.465 --> 36:00.463
Don't jump to conclusions
about Saperstein.

36:00.690 --> 36:01.463
If there's a warrant,

36:01.550 --> 36:03.432
maybe the Feds tried
to pick him up and he ran.

36:03.626 --> 36:07.146
Or maybe he tried to save
his own ass and sold us all out.

36:14.338 --> 36:15.894
Frank!

36:16.903 --> 36:18.173
You made it.

36:18.623 --> 36:20.568
Tiffany's gonna be relieved.

36:20.668 --> 36:22.000
Where is she?

36:22.195 --> 36:25.733
She's out front.
Take a look.

36:29.271 --> 36:31.106
Hey, Brian, hi.
I'm Matt.

36:31.197 --> 36:32.614
It's okay.

36:33.916 --> 36:35.597
I'm here to help you, okay?

36:35.677 --> 36:37.041
It's gonna be okay.

36:38.514 --> 36:40.773
Got you everything
that we promised,

36:41.039 --> 36:42.682
but you're gonna have
to put your gun down.

36:42.784 --> 36:45.353
Yeah, right.
Like you're not packing?

36:45.572 --> 36:48.188
We'll both
put our guns down.

36:48.329 --> 36:49.762
But just remember,

36:49.860 --> 36:52.398
anything bad happens up here,

36:52.583 --> 36:55.902
leads to something bad
down there.

36:57.190 --> 36:59.505
Give a distance.

36:59.811 --> 37:01.110
Ready?

37:02.440 --> 37:03.442
Throw.

37:06.907 --> 37:08.519
Car I drove is clean.

37:08.608 --> 37:10.492
Nobody's gonna be
looking for it.

37:10.891 --> 37:12.773
Tiffany's downstairs.

37:12.894 --> 37:15.623
$5,000 in cash.

37:15.793 --> 37:17.702
Everything we promised.

37:27.115 --> 37:28.603
All right?

37:28.757 --> 37:31.443
On three, you let him go.
I throw the money.

37:32.521 --> 37:36.121
One, two, three.

37:37.757 --> 37:39.715
Come on, son.
Brian.

37:40.016 --> 37:42.472
Hey, what are you doing?

37:42.581 --> 37:45.297
That's not part of the deal.
No surprises.

37:47.164 --> 37:49.018
That counts as a surprise.

37:49.106 --> 37:50.632
New deal.

37:50.833 --> 37:52.746
I'm taking my son,

37:52.844 --> 37:55.543
I'm taking my girlfriend,
and we're leaving.

37:55.628 --> 37:59.054
Turn around, and put your hands
behind your head.

37:59.161 --> 38:02.840
My man downstairs
is not gonna let this happen.

38:02.938 --> 38:04.130
You were gonna trade.

38:04.199 --> 38:05.862
I'm guessing he will too.

38:07.628 --> 38:08.873
Drop the gun.

38:08.967 --> 38:10.824
No surprises, huh?

38:11.826 --> 38:13.791
You can't shoot
both of us, Frank.

38:14.186 --> 38:15.340
Drop it.

38:19.579 --> 38:22.635
There is no way
he's going back to his mother.

38:22.722 --> 38:24.603
That bitch dimed me out.

38:25.070 --> 38:26.963
<i>â™ª</i>

38:29.407 --> 38:30.623
Okay.

38:31.128 --> 38:32.514
Easy.
I'm putting it down.

38:38.693 --> 38:40.822
You said no cops!

38:42.543 --> 38:43.367
Run downstairs.

38:43.447 --> 38:45.699
Run downstairs, Brian.
Go! Go!

39:06.494 --> 39:07.699
Have you seen Saperstein?

39:07.773 --> 39:09.193
Pulled up
and asked for Wozniak.

39:09.262 --> 39:10.958
When I told him he was up top,
he just lit out.

39:11.032 --> 39:12.224
I couldn't leave
the fiancÃ©e.

39:14.422 --> 39:15.588
Take her inside.

39:15.710 --> 39:17.275
Keep her away from the windows.

39:23.722 --> 39:25.152
Little help here, Woz?

39:37.514 --> 39:40.130
Hey, it's okay.
Are you Brian?

39:40.242 --> 39:41.769
- They have guns.
- This is Tess.

39:41.898 --> 39:43.778
She's gonna take you
to call your mom.

39:44.083 --> 39:45.695
- All right.
- Be careful, Harlee.

39:47.827 --> 39:49.661
You been talking
to the Feds.

39:49.786 --> 39:51.449
It's not like that.

39:51.903 --> 39:53.282
They picked me up.

39:53.565 --> 39:54.702
The said they were
gonna put me away.

39:54.786 --> 39:56.784
I had no choice, Woz.

39:58.257 --> 39:59.038
Neither do I.

39:59.108 --> 39:59.835
Whoa!

40:20.266 --> 40:21.277
No.
Please!

40:36.141 --> 40:37.561
They fell.

40:37.789 --> 40:39.815
Sap shot him, and they fell.

40:44.791 --> 40:46.637
No.
No.

40:48.197 --> 40:50.842
Sap!
Sap!

40:51.581 --> 40:52.751
Sap!

40:57.250 --> 40:59.032
Oh, no.
No.

41:03.748 --> 41:06.081
Harlee.

41:06.335 --> 41:08.483
There was nothing
I could have done.

41:09.202 --> 41:10.989
There's nothing
I could have done.

41:21.018 --> 41:23.054
Hey, he's still breathing!

41:23.813 --> 41:25.902
He's still breathing!
