WEBVTT

00:02.436 --> 00:04.505
("At Last" by Etta James
playing)

00:20.321 --> 00:25.293
* At last

00:28.596 --> 00:33.301
* My love has come along

00:36.804 --> 00:41.775
* My lonely days are over

00:45.346 --> 00:49.583
* And life is like a song

00:53.221 --> 00:58.058
* Oh, yeah, yeah, at last

01:00.828 --> 01:05.566
* The skies above are blue...

01:08.269 --> 01:09.737
(clattering,
men shouting indistinctly)

01:09.770 --> 01:12.806
* My heart was wrapped up
in clover... *

01:12.840 --> 01:15.809
(glass shattering, men grunting)

01:18.146 --> 01:23.117
* The night I looked at you

01:27.255 --> 01:29.223
* I found a dream...

01:29.257 --> 01:31.725
(groaning)

01:31.759 --> 01:35.463
* That I could speak to

01:36.597 --> 01:39.733
* A dream that I...

01:39.767 --> 01:43.837
(dialing)
* Can call my own

01:43.871 --> 01:47.641
* I found a thrill

01:47.675 --> 01:51.845
* To press my cheek to

01:51.879 --> 01:54.382
* A thrill that I...

01:54.415 --> 01:55.516
(two gunshots)

01:55.549 --> 01:56.684
(bystanders screaming)

01:56.717 --> 01:59.220
* Have never known

01:59.253 --> 02:04.258
* Oh, yeah, yeah, you smiled

02:04.292 --> 02:06.660
* You smiled

02:06.694 --> 02:09.530
* Oh, and then

02:09.562 --> 02:12.466
* The spell was cast

02:16.204 --> 02:20.708
* And here we are in heaven

02:23.577 --> 02:28.749
* For you are mine

02:29.650 --> 02:33.721
* At last.

02:33.754 --> 02:35.756
*

02:56.677 --> 02:58.679
(song ends)

03:19.533 --> 03:23.671
* Out here in the fields

03:23.704 --> 03:27.608
* I fight for my meals

03:27.641 --> 03:32.446
* I get my back into my living

03:34.648 --> 03:36.750
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.893
(siren wailing)

04:16.990 --> 04:20.428
*

04:27.368 --> 04:30.804
Champagne, chocolate
strawberries, candy hearts?

04:30.838 --> 04:32.806
Somebody was
in a Valentine's Day mood.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.309
Looks more like someone was
in the mood for World War III.

04:35.343 --> 04:37.311
Pretty much how the other
guests described it

04:37.345 --> 04:38.646
when they called security.

04:38.679 --> 04:40.914
Said they heard
two men arguing.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.350
The vic's name
is Theodore Hart.

04:42.383 --> 04:44.852
Priors for assault, drug
possession, and menacing

04:44.885 --> 04:45.919
to name a few.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.988
Doesn't seem
like a guy

04:48.021 --> 04:50.591
who'd shell out $1,200 a night
for a place like this.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.593
Because he didn't.
Hotel log shows

04:52.626 --> 04:54.595
he's not the guest that
checked in. The room is

04:54.628 --> 04:56.764
registered to a Wayne Brown.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.098
He used
his credit card

04:58.131 --> 05:00.901
with a home billing address
in Gramercy.

05:00.934 --> 05:03.337
Not much reason to splurge
on a pricy hotel room

05:03.371 --> 05:05.573
when you live
ten blocks away.

05:05.606 --> 05:07.341
Special getaway?

05:07.375 --> 05:09.377
Or a secret one.

05:09.410 --> 05:11.879
Well, either way, it doesn't
explain why there's a dead felon

05:11.912 --> 05:13.514
on the floor.

05:13.547 --> 05:16.984
Let's find Wayne Brown,
have him fill in the blanks.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.098
Am I going to jail?

05:31.131 --> 05:32.933
Did you kill that man?

05:33.934 --> 05:35.903
I just wanted him to stop.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.104
Stop what?

05:43.777 --> 05:45.779
Why don't we start
at the beginning, Wayne?

05:45.813 --> 05:48.916
Why'd you book a room tonight
at the St. Monarch Hotel?

05:48.949 --> 05:50.618
I didn't.

05:50.651 --> 05:52.920
I mean, that wasn't
my plan at first.

05:52.953 --> 05:55.623
I was just gonna have a drink
at the bar and go home.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.758
So, when did your plans change?

05:57.791 --> 05:59.026
(sighs)

05:59.059 --> 06:02.930
When the most beautiful woman I
had ever seen asked me my name.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.898
I thought it was a
mistake at first,

06:04.932 --> 06:06.967
like she confused me
with somebody else,

06:07.000 --> 06:09.870
but she sat down
and we just started talking.

06:09.903 --> 06:10.804
About what?

06:10.838 --> 06:14.542
Everything, anything.

06:14.575 --> 06:15.809
It was so easy,

06:15.843 --> 06:18.712
so comfortable, I-I
didn't want it to end.

06:18.746 --> 06:19.713
LOVATO:
So you decided

06:19.747 --> 06:20.914
to get a room together.

06:23.984 --> 06:26.754
I'd never done anything
like that before, I swear.

06:26.787 --> 06:30.057
I just didn't want to be alone
on Valentine's Day again.

06:30.090 --> 06:31.859
So, did you guys go
upstairs together?

06:33.761 --> 06:35.729
She told me she'd
meet me in the room,

06:35.763 --> 06:39.066
so I went up first, ordered
some champagne, and waited.

06:39.099 --> 06:40.067
(knocking)

06:40.100 --> 06:42.135
There was a knock at the door.

06:42.169 --> 06:44.705
I assumed it was her,
but it wasn't.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.874
(grunts)
He just started attacking me.

06:50.778 --> 06:52.913
I was blacking out.

06:52.946 --> 06:56.450
At the last second
I grabbed the corkscrew and...

06:56.484 --> 06:57.885
Aah!

06:57.918 --> 07:00.053
WAYNE:
I didn't want to hurt him,

07:00.087 --> 07:01.922
but I had to protect myself.

07:01.955 --> 07:03.991
You know, if what
you're saying is true,

07:04.024 --> 07:05.125
why did you leave
the hotel?

07:05.158 --> 07:06.560
You should have called
the police

07:06.594 --> 07:07.695
and waited
until they arrived.

07:07.728 --> 07:08.929
I was scared.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.163
That we wouldn't believe
that you killed him

07:10.197 --> 07:11.799
in self-defense?
Until you told me,

07:11.832 --> 07:13.801
I didn't even know he was dead.

07:13.834 --> 07:16.236
I ran because I was afraid
he was going

07:16.269 --> 07:18.472
to get back up.

07:19.873 --> 07:22.109
What was her name--
the woman you met at the bar?

07:22.142 --> 07:24.011
Laura.

07:24.044 --> 07:25.078
Last name?

07:26.113 --> 07:28.549
I don't know.

07:31.084 --> 07:33.053
(door closes)

07:33.086 --> 07:35.155
The vic could have been
a jealous boyfriend or husband.

07:35.188 --> 07:36.289
Found out
that Laura was planning

07:36.323 --> 07:39.192
some extracurricular activities
and wanted to stop it.

07:39.226 --> 07:41.562
If there ever really
was a Laura.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.734
What is it about
Valentine's Day

07:46.767 --> 07:48.636
that just makes people
lose their minds?

07:48.669 --> 07:50.270
Is that today?

07:50.303 --> 07:52.039
Yeah, it's today.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.741
Right.

07:53.774 --> 07:56.744
You want to...
maybe do something later?

07:56.777 --> 07:58.078
Yeah, maybe.

07:59.146 --> 08:02.049
How about a couple beers and
a slice, maybe watch a game?

08:02.082 --> 08:03.917
Perfect.
Really?

08:03.951 --> 08:05.218
Yeah.

08:05.252 --> 08:07.888
What, do you really think
that all women need

08:07.921 --> 08:10.991
that sentimental crap
to make them happy?

08:22.002 --> 08:23.704
(sighs)
I was hoping today,
of all days,

08:23.737 --> 08:25.072
people might be
a little nicer

08:25.105 --> 08:26.073
to each other.

08:26.106 --> 08:27.274
You're, of
course, referring

08:27.307 --> 08:30.544
to the kindly deeds
of St. Valentinus,

08:30.578 --> 08:32.913
one of at least three
martyred saints to whom

08:32.946 --> 08:36.149
this secular and commercial
holiday is attributed.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.150
Well, call me a sap,

08:37.183 --> 08:39.919
but any excuse to celebrate love
is okay by me.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.321
(laughs)

08:41.354 --> 08:42.722
Fair enough.

08:42.756 --> 08:43.624
Let's start

08:43.657 --> 08:45.659
with the penetrating wound
to the neck

08:45.693 --> 08:47.961
courtesy of
this corkscrew.

08:47.995 --> 08:49.029
Did it puncture
his carotid?

08:49.062 --> 08:49.930
As a matter of fact, no.

08:49.963 --> 08:52.700
It missed vital
structures altogether.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.668
Well, then,
what killed him?

08:54.702 --> 08:56.770
Blunt force trauma

08:56.804 --> 08:59.072
to the parietal bone.

08:59.106 --> 09:00.641
C.O.D.

09:00.674 --> 09:02.710
is a single blow
to the back of the head.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.912
Huh.

09:04.945 --> 09:07.080
Jo thought the blood spray was
arterial and that he hit

09:07.114 --> 09:10.017
his head on the floor
after he was stabbed.

09:10.050 --> 09:13.020
A logical assumption, but
instead of carpet fibers,

09:13.053 --> 09:15.322
I found flecks of gold
foil and what appears

09:15.355 --> 09:19.059
to be green glass
embedded in his scalp.

09:19.092 --> 09:20.994
The champagne bottle
that Jo found.

09:21.028 --> 09:22.930
Right.
So,

09:22.963 --> 09:25.065
our suspect said that the vic

09:25.098 --> 09:27.100
was standing directly above him
during the attack.

09:27.134 --> 09:28.235
(grunting)

09:28.268 --> 09:32.005
So how could Wayne have hit Hart
in the back of the head

09:32.039 --> 09:33.040
if he was underneath him?

09:33.073 --> 09:35.843
He couldn't have.

09:35.876 --> 09:38.812
Either Wayne was behind the vic
when he struck him...

09:38.846 --> 09:40.714
Or he wasn't the only one
in that room.

09:41.649 --> 09:43.984
Thanks, Sid.

09:44.017 --> 09:46.053
You bet.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.587
(sighs)

09:48.288 --> 09:49.690
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
where's the fire at?
Hey.

09:49.723 --> 09:53.126
I got to find Jo; our case
just got turned on its head.
Are you serious?

09:53.160 --> 09:54.895
Does that mean we might not be
able to go to dinner tonight?

09:54.928 --> 09:57.097
Will you shut up? I know that
you hate Valentine's Day.

09:57.130 --> 09:58.098
I don't hate
Valentine's Day.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.067
I just think it's stupid
to go spend on a fortune

10:00.100 --> 10:02.302
on some fancy meal just
'cause everybody else does.

10:02.335 --> 10:03.837
Well, now you don't
have to, okay?

10:03.871 --> 10:05.105
Consider that
my gift to you.

10:05.138 --> 10:06.073
(kisses)

10:06.106 --> 10:08.041
But I promise we will
celebrate tonight, okay?

10:08.075 --> 10:11.845
Okay, see you at
home eventually.

10:15.382 --> 10:18.285
(car horn honking)

10:20.153 --> 10:22.422
ELLIE (over phone):
Midnight? Mom, the movie
doesn't end until 11:45.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.424
That gives you
15 minutes

10:24.457 --> 10:25.993
for Andrew to walk you home,

10:26.026 --> 10:27.661
give you a good-night kiss
on the cheek

10:27.695 --> 10:28.929
before your curfew.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.164
Mom, it's Valentine's Day.

10:31.198 --> 10:34.167
All right, 12:15
and not a second later, Ellie,

10:34.201 --> 10:35.268
and remind Andrew

10:35.302 --> 10:36.436
that I carry a gun.

10:36.469 --> 10:37.705
Mom.

10:37.738 --> 10:38.972
I love you.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.307
Have a great time.

10:40.340 --> 10:41.141
Be safe.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.943
Love you, too.
Mwah.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.077
(phone beeps off)
Okay, I don't know

10:44.111 --> 10:46.146
what's more depressing--
the fact that my 15-year-old has

10:46.179 --> 10:47.347
a hot date
tonight

10:47.380 --> 10:48.982
or the fact that I don't.

10:49.016 --> 10:49.917
Well, get this.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.885
Vic was arrested three
times for assault.

10:51.919 --> 10:54.788
He liked to beat up hookers,
especially the ones

10:54.822 --> 10:55.789
that worked
for him.

10:55.823 --> 10:57.124
Hart was a pimp.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.226
That means the woman
Wayne was talking to...

10:59.259 --> 11:00.360
Could have been a hooker.

11:00.393 --> 11:02.129
So either Wayne had no idea

11:02.162 --> 11:03.030
or he lied to us
about his random

11:03.063 --> 11:05.733
love connection.
That's not the only thing

11:05.766 --> 11:07.067
he lied about--
Wayne didn't

11:07.100 --> 11:08.769
go up to that room
by himself.

11:08.802 --> 11:11.104
Adam found a partial print
on a chocolate strawberry

11:11.138 --> 11:12.239
and another one
on the champagne bottle

11:12.272 --> 11:15.342
that killed Theodore Hart.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.077
So taken independently,
neither print

11:17.110 --> 11:19.079
had enough rich detail
to get a hit in AFIS,

11:19.112 --> 11:22.215
but he overlaid them
and got a complete print.

11:22.249 --> 11:25.285
Say hello to Laura Palmer.

11:25.318 --> 11:26.820
She's in the
system for...

11:26.854 --> 11:27.955
a half dozen
solicitation arrests.

11:27.988 --> 11:30.090
Well, that puts her in the hotel
room but not much else.

11:30.123 --> 11:31.224
Unless you
consider

11:31.258 --> 11:32.960
the directionality
of the print--

11:32.993 --> 11:34.962
it was upside down.
Why does that matter?

11:34.995 --> 11:37.230
Tells us how she was holding
the bottle.

11:38.265 --> 11:39.900
If you're pouring champagne,

11:39.933 --> 11:42.369
your print is right side up.
Turn it around...

11:42.402 --> 11:45.205
And the champagne bottle
becomes a murder weapon.

11:47.174 --> 11:51.478
Wayne looked so sad and lonely
sitting at the bar by himself.

11:51.511 --> 11:54.848
Thought I could help.

11:54.882 --> 11:57.184
By exploiting
his vulnerability?

11:57.217 --> 11:59.186
By doing my job.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.955
Not my fault the world is
a cold and cynical place.

12:03.056 --> 12:06.126
What happened
in that hotel room?

12:06.159 --> 12:08.128
Not what you think.

12:08.161 --> 12:11.164
All Wayne wanted to do was talk.

12:11.198 --> 12:13.000
He asked where
I was from,

12:13.033 --> 12:15.002
about my family
and my friends.

12:15.035 --> 12:17.404
Crazy part is it seemed
like he actually cared.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.506
Maybe he really did.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.242
Time must've gotten away
from me

12:22.275 --> 12:24.778
'cause I forgot to
check in with Theo.

12:24.812 --> 12:26.947
That's his number one rule.

12:26.980 --> 12:29.182
So he came
looking for you?

12:29.216 --> 12:31.251
LAURA:
Theo was pissed as hell--
thought I was

12:31.284 --> 12:32.219
disrespecting him.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.553
Theo. No.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.056
(grunting)

12:36.089 --> 12:38.959
Leave him alone, Theo!

12:38.992 --> 12:41.194
He didn't
do anything!

12:41.228 --> 12:42.930
Theo, stop!

12:42.963 --> 12:44.965
He was gonna kill
the poor guy.

12:44.998 --> 12:46.066
(grunting, shouts)

12:46.099 --> 12:48.301
I had to do something.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.246
Funny thing, Laura,
you know, Wayne told us

12:59.279 --> 13:02.049
that... he killed Theodore Hart.

13:02.082 --> 13:04.051
Why would he do that?

13:04.084 --> 13:06.453
You'd have to ask him.

13:06.486 --> 13:09.456
Maybe it's because the world
is not as cold and cynical

13:09.489 --> 13:10.490
as you think.

13:24.371 --> 13:26.139
What's gonna happen to her?

13:26.173 --> 13:28.041
The District Attorney
will review the evidence,

13:28.075 --> 13:30.043
and if he agrees
that it was self-defense,

13:30.077 --> 13:31.411
she'll be free to go.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.349
I knew what she was.

13:37.417 --> 13:40.220
I guess there was
just a part of me

13:40.253 --> 13:43.056
that wanted to believe that
the spark between us was real.

13:44.257 --> 13:46.226
Even if it was
only temporary.

13:46.259 --> 13:49.229
Please tell her
I said thank you.

13:49.262 --> 13:51.098
I will.

13:53.200 --> 13:56.403
DANVILLE:
Why is true love
so hard to find?

13:56.436 --> 13:59.339
It helps if you look
in the right places.

13:59.372 --> 14:03.176
Any idea where
those places are?

14:03.210 --> 14:05.312
(chuckles)

14:10.183 --> 14:13.486
Bernie must've come home early
to surprise me.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.088
When I got back
from the gym,

14:15.122 --> 14:18.591
I found him just lying there
on the floor.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.928
When was the last time you spoke
to your husband, Mrs. Chandler?

14:20.961 --> 14:22.629
Uh, around lunchtime.

14:22.662 --> 14:25.598
He told me that he had something
important to discuss.

14:25.632 --> 14:28.301
Did he say what that was?

14:28.335 --> 14:30.003
Only that he needed
to tell me in person.

14:30.037 --> 14:34.007
Bernie always had a...
flair for the dramatic.

14:35.042 --> 14:37.577
(sighs)
What am I gonna do now?

14:37.610 --> 14:41.314
Bernie was my everything.

14:41.348 --> 14:43.250
And today wasn't only

14:43.283 --> 14:45.618
Valentine's Day; it was also
our fifth anniversary.

14:45.652 --> 14:49.056
(sighs)
I mean, is there anyone
that you can think of

14:49.089 --> 14:51.191
that would want
to hurt your husband?

14:51.224 --> 14:53.193
Everybody loved Bernie.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.195
He had a way about him.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.464
Lit up the room
the second he arrived.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.166
He just... knew how to make

14:59.199 --> 15:01.201
people happy.
Mrs. Chandler, I'm sorry

15:01.234 --> 15:02.535
for your loss.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.972
Did you send this box
of chocolates to your husband?

15:05.005 --> 15:07.340
No, that would've been cruel.

15:07.374 --> 15:08.942
Bernie was trying
to lose weight,

15:08.976 --> 15:10.944
and sweets were his weakness.

15:10.978 --> 15:13.380
Besides,
he was diabetic.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.416
Any idea who
sent that to him?

15:16.449 --> 15:18.618
(phone ringing)

15:18.651 --> 15:20.988
It's... my mother-in-law.

15:21.021 --> 15:23.023
Okay. Go ahead.

15:24.657 --> 15:26.626
What's wrong with
this picture, huh?

15:26.659 --> 15:28.295
HAWKES:
I just see a
couple in love.

15:28.328 --> 15:30.430
Couple that couldn't be
more mismatched.

15:30.463 --> 15:32.332
I'm gonna guess
that this guy's loaded.

15:32.365 --> 15:34.267
Are you...
trying to say

15:34.301 --> 15:35.668
that someone who's beautiful
on the outside

15:35.702 --> 15:37.437
could never fall for someone
whose beauty's

15:37.470 --> 15:39.272
on the inside?
(chuckling):
I mean...

15:39.306 --> 15:41.608
unless there's power and money
stacking the deck.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.210
That's just
narrow-minded

15:43.243 --> 15:45.445
and sad, man. Yeah.
Really? Why are you all

15:45.478 --> 15:49.049
bent out of shape about that,
Mr. GQ Smoothie over here?
Uh, you know what?

15:50.083 --> 15:52.385
(sighs)
Never mind.

15:52.419 --> 15:54.054
Ah.

15:54.087 --> 15:56.123
So, you find any signs
of struggle?

15:56.156 --> 15:57.457
No. No,

15:57.490 --> 15:59.993
and nothing on the body
to indicate he was attacked.

16:00.027 --> 16:02.029
Couldn't find any signs
of forced entry either.

16:02.062 --> 16:03.496
So then what are we doing
here then? Our vic

16:03.530 --> 16:05.465
was the poster child
for heart disease, no?
No,

16:05.498 --> 16:07.700
not so fast. I didn't find
any xanthomas on his eyelids

16:07.734 --> 16:09.702
to suggest fat buildup
in the blood.

16:09.736 --> 16:12.372
So heart attack is a possibility
but it wouldn't be my first

16:12.405 --> 16:13.706
guess at C.O.D.
Hmm. All right.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.242
Ball's in Sid's court.

16:15.275 --> 16:17.077
Yeah. I'll tell you this,
whatever happened here,

16:17.110 --> 16:18.745
Bernard Chandler knew
he was in serious trouble

16:18.778 --> 16:20.147
and tried to call for help.

16:22.049 --> 16:24.051
(siren wailing)

16:31.824 --> 16:33.793
Full house, huh, Sid?

16:33.826 --> 16:37.330
Oh, Mr. Messer. What a treat.

16:37.364 --> 16:38.798
I only wish it were
under different circumstances.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.667
Yeah. Tell me about it.

16:40.700 --> 16:43.170
So, uh, what's the deal
with Bernard Chandler here?

16:43.203 --> 16:44.737
Well, penetrating wounds

16:44.771 --> 16:47.607
across his chest were
caused by glass shards.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.742
But all were shallow
and superficial.

16:49.776 --> 16:51.578
All right, so what's the C.O.D.?

16:51.611 --> 16:54.781
To answer that, I began
with the inordinate amount

16:54.814 --> 16:57.817
of undigested chocolate in
his stomach-- two pounds worth.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.287
That's a lot of chocolate, huh?

17:00.320 --> 17:03.523
Gluttonous, yes, but under
normal circumstances not lethal.

17:03.556 --> 17:06.193
Unfortunately our vic's
pancreatic function

17:06.226 --> 17:07.660
was anything but normal.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.530
Because of his diabetes.
Type 1, to be exact.

17:10.563 --> 17:11.731
I detected a fruity

17:11.763 --> 17:14.634
acetone-like odor
in the vic's mouth,

17:14.666 --> 17:16.136
indicating a hyperosmolar

17:16.169 --> 17:19.071
hyperglycemic state.
So he OD'd on sugar.

17:19.106 --> 17:21.141
Precisely. C.O.D. is

17:21.174 --> 17:24.277
acute shock and respiratory
failure as a result of...

17:24.310 --> 17:25.678
severely elevated
glucose levels.

17:25.712 --> 17:28.080
I mean, Sid, come on.
This doesn't make any sense.

17:28.115 --> 17:30.517
Lifetime diabetic eats
an entire box of chocolate?

17:30.550 --> 17:33.320
And then doesn't use his insulin
to save his own life?

17:33.353 --> 17:35.188
Well, this fresh

17:35.222 --> 17:37.790
injection site suggests
he may have tried to.

17:38.791 --> 17:42.061
All right, but then
why didn't it work?

17:44.331 --> 17:47.234
(siren wailing)

18:03.850 --> 18:05.385
Don't shoot him!

18:06.919 --> 18:11.391
"Bring him to Teterboro Airport,
hangar 20."

18:12.492 --> 18:14.827
(phone rings)

18:14.861 --> 18:17.397
Mac? Hey.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.166
Hey, I'm sorry.

18:19.199 --> 18:22.135
It, uh, doesn't look good
for our 8:00 reservation.

18:22.169 --> 18:23.203
Well, I'll call the restaurant,

18:23.236 --> 18:24.571
see if they have
an opening later.

18:24.604 --> 18:28.141
On Valentine's Day?
Uh, we may be out of luck.

18:28.175 --> 18:31.244
That's okay. I'll just, uh,
pick up some food instead.

18:31.278 --> 18:33.813
Aw, I was really looking forward
to going out tonight.

18:33.846 --> 18:36.183
Well, you know,
maybe it's for the best.

18:36.216 --> 18:38.485
What you went through
was hell, Christine.

18:38.518 --> 18:42.189
Recovering from that kind
of trauma is gonna take time and

18:42.222 --> 18:44.491
patience. You don't have
to push yourself.

18:44.524 --> 18:45.625
I know.

18:45.658 --> 18:49.362
A-And I accept that, Mac.

18:49.396 --> 18:51.498
I know, but I also refuse
to spend another minute

18:51.531 --> 18:54.634
hiding from the world. I need
to get out of this apartment.

18:54.667 --> 18:58.938
Besides, is there any better
excuse than Valentine's Day?

18:58.971 --> 19:00.607
All right.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.309
See if you can change
the reservation.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.177
I'll call you back
in a little bit.

19:04.211 --> 19:05.745
Okay. And, Mac?

19:05.778 --> 19:08.581
You don't have to check on me
every 15 minutes.

19:08.615 --> 19:09.716
I need you to know

19:09.749 --> 19:11.184
you're not going
through this alone.

19:11.218 --> 19:13.353
I do.

19:13.386 --> 19:14.521
I know.

19:14.554 --> 19:16.389
I'll see you later tonight.

19:16.423 --> 19:17.757
Bye.

19:19.892 --> 19:20.927
Hey. Christine?

19:20.960 --> 19:22.395
Yeah.

19:22.429 --> 19:23.563
How's she holding up?

19:23.596 --> 19:24.731
She's better.

19:24.764 --> 19:27.200
She's a fighter.
Stubborn as hell.

19:27.234 --> 19:28.901
Mm-hmm, sounds familiar.

19:28.935 --> 19:31.604
You two were made
for each other.

19:32.639 --> 19:35.675
*

20:03.970 --> 20:05.938
*

20:25.792 --> 20:28.761
(sighs)
So...

20:28.795 --> 20:31.298
vic was definitely up
to something shady.

20:31.331 --> 20:34.000
I found two dozen texts
between Bernard Chandler

20:34.033 --> 20:35.502
and a woman by the name
of Evelyn Long.

20:35.535 --> 20:37.404
And I'm thinking
she might've been the one

20:37.437 --> 20:39.506
who sent him
the chocolates.
What were they discussing?

20:39.539 --> 20:41.474
I don't know. The messages
were kind of cryptic,

20:41.508 --> 20:43.410
but from what I gathered,

20:43.443 --> 20:44.644
they were planning
some sort of trip

20:44.677 --> 20:45.645
and they didn't want
the wife to find out.

20:45.678 --> 20:46.946
Okay, so if Sandra did find out

20:46.979 --> 20:48.415
her husband was having
an affair,

20:48.448 --> 20:50.317
that definitely constitutes
motive for murder.

20:50.350 --> 20:52.051
Sid says he was killed by taking

20:52.084 --> 20:54.321
too much sugar.
So how do you convince

20:54.354 --> 20:56.989
a diabetic to risk his life
by eating a box of chocolates?

20:57.023 --> 20:58.591
(computer beeps)

21:06.633 --> 21:08.835
HAWKES:
By making him think
there wasn't any risk.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.970
Before this was torn off,

21:11.003 --> 21:13.540
this chocolate was labeled
sugar free,

21:13.573 --> 21:15.442
listing Malitol
as the sweetener.

21:15.475 --> 21:17.344
Which only partially digests

21:17.377 --> 21:19.746
and barely affects
your blood sugar.
Right.

21:19.779 --> 21:23.316
But the sample I took
from Chandler's stomach contents

21:23.350 --> 21:25.017
contained
concentrated levels

21:25.051 --> 21:27.620
of refined sucrose--
nothing sugar free about it.

21:27.654 --> 21:29.789
So the wife switched out
the chocolates

21:29.822 --> 21:33.393
and he ate them,
thinking they were safe.
And she tore off

21:33.426 --> 21:35.528
the label
before calling the police.

21:35.562 --> 21:38.030
Damn, that's twisted.
But it still doesn't
explain how she stopped

21:38.064 --> 21:39.632
an insulin injection
from saving him.

21:39.666 --> 21:40.633
SANDRA:
Why am I here?

21:40.667 --> 21:42.535
You're here

21:42.569 --> 21:45.405
because you murdered
your husband.
That's ridiculous.

21:45.438 --> 21:47.674
I loved Bernie deeply.
No man ever treated me

21:47.707 --> 21:48.775
with the same respect

21:48.808 --> 21:50.710
and kindness
as he did.
Maybe,

21:50.743 --> 21:52.712
until you started to suspect
that he was cheating on you.

21:52.745 --> 21:53.646
Which would

21:53.680 --> 21:56.048
make you angry enough
to want Bernie dead.

21:56.082 --> 21:57.116
I've heard enough,

21:57.149 --> 21:58.651
okay? I'm leaving.
Sit down.

21:58.685 --> 21:59.586
Sit down.

21:59.619 --> 22:00.953
We're just
getting started.

22:00.987 --> 22:02.121
We searched

22:02.154 --> 22:03.322
your apartment
for his insulin.

22:03.356 --> 22:06.092
DANNY:
We didn't find that,
but we found something

22:06.125 --> 22:07.860
all over your vanity.

22:07.894 --> 22:08.895
Simple syrup.

22:08.928 --> 22:10.497
Mixture of, uh,
sugar and water.

22:10.530 --> 22:11.831
Yeah, I know what it is.

22:11.864 --> 22:13.400
Well, then you know what happens

22:13.433 --> 22:15.468
when you replaced Bernie's
insulin with it, right?

22:15.502 --> 22:16.503
You bought him a box

22:16.536 --> 22:18.471
of, uh, sugar-free
chocolates,

22:18.505 --> 22:19.906
and then you
replaced them

22:19.939 --> 22:21.073
with the regular ones?

22:21.107 --> 22:22.274
Really? Huh?
Then he gets home,

22:22.308 --> 22:24.711
he sees the surprise you
left him, and he goes to town,

22:24.744 --> 22:26.479
'cause, you said, right,
he had a weakness

22:26.513 --> 22:28.080
for sweets.
His sugar level

22:28.114 --> 22:29.416
goes through the roof
immediately.

22:29.449 --> 22:30.850
Gets dizzy,

22:30.883 --> 22:32.819
disoriented, he's
out of breath.

22:32.852 --> 22:35.488
He would recognize
that he needed his insulin.

22:35.522 --> 22:37.424
But then what?

22:37.457 --> 22:39.892
Thanks to you,
all he's doing

22:39.926 --> 22:43.863
is injecting himself
with one final, fatal dose

22:43.896 --> 22:45.598
of sugar.

22:45.632 --> 22:48.401
(grunts)

22:48.435 --> 22:51.438
So you tried to hide
the evidence, right?

22:51.471 --> 22:54.474
So we wouldn't find it?

22:55.742 --> 22:59.746
And with all due respect,
Mrs. Chandler, throwing it down

22:59.779 --> 23:01.180
the garbage chute? Come on.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.182
That's pretty stupid.

23:03.215 --> 23:06.419
You don't think we're
gonna find that?

23:10.723 --> 23:12.158
I knew something was up

23:12.191 --> 23:15.161
when Bernie started
leaving the room to take calls.

23:15.194 --> 23:17.129
When he suddenly
added a password

23:17.163 --> 23:19.466
to his phone.
It didn't take me long

23:19.499 --> 23:21.501
to break that.
So you read
the texts

23:21.534 --> 23:23.069
between him and Evelyn.

23:23.102 --> 23:25.605
It was like being stabbed
through the chest.

23:26.639 --> 23:30.209
I couldn't breathe.

23:30.242 --> 23:33.446
I saw the way other women
looked at my husband,

23:33.480 --> 23:35.682
the way they envied me.

23:35.715 --> 23:38.184
Whoever this
Evelyn was,

23:38.217 --> 23:40.687
I just knew she was
prettier than me.

23:40.720 --> 23:42.655
Younger.

23:42.689 --> 23:44.857
But the worst part--

23:44.891 --> 23:48.461
he was taking her
on my dream vacation.

23:49.829 --> 23:52.899
My heart and soul
really did belong
to my husband.

23:52.932 --> 23:55.201
He was the Prince Charming
I had wished for

23:55.234 --> 23:57.504
ever since I was a little girl.

23:57.537 --> 24:00.873
But now you hated him
'cause he broke your heart.

24:00.907 --> 24:02.975
I hated myself.

24:03.009 --> 24:04.243
Why did you hate yourself?

24:04.276 --> 24:07.146
For not being good enough.

24:07.179 --> 24:09.181
For not being the wife
that Bernie wanted,

24:09.215 --> 24:10.717
the one he deserved.

24:10.750 --> 24:12.785
I always feared
that he'd come home someday

24:12.819 --> 24:14.821
and tell me that
he'd found someone better.

24:14.854 --> 24:17.524
And he said to you that
he needed to have a serious talk

24:17.557 --> 24:19.526
with you, so you thought
today might be that day.

24:19.559 --> 24:23.229
I couldn't let him walk away.

24:23.262 --> 24:27.199
The thought of him having
a life with another woman...

24:27.233 --> 24:29.802
(voice breaks):
would've killed me.

24:29.836 --> 24:32.238
So you killed him instead?

24:32.271 --> 24:34.741
Evelyn Long...

24:37.544 --> 24:39.512
...uh, she was your husband's

24:39.546 --> 24:42.114
travel agent,
and she was helping him

24:42.148 --> 24:45.518
set up the trip to Europe
for the two of you.

24:45.552 --> 24:47.687
That was the
big surprise.

24:50.990 --> 24:54.126
Happy anniversary,
Mrs. Chandler.

24:59.265 --> 25:01.167
*

25:01.200 --> 25:03.269
(door closes)

25:11.611 --> 25:13.580
(sighing):
Ooh.

25:13.613 --> 25:15.682
From the outside
looking in,

25:15.715 --> 25:17.884
Sandra was
the ultimate prize.

25:17.917 --> 25:20.286
But in her mind, it was
the other way around.

25:20.319 --> 25:23.823
Yep, I guess I was wrong, huh--
true love is really blind.

25:25.124 --> 25:27.594
Something I want
to show you.
All right.

25:27.627 --> 25:29.862
What?

25:29.896 --> 25:31.263
(sighs)

25:37.169 --> 25:40.339
*

25:40.372 --> 25:42.742
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa,
this is you?

25:42.775 --> 25:44.577
Yeah. I was 20,

25:44.611 --> 25:47.580
and madly in love with
a girl named Susie Thomas.

25:47.614 --> 25:50.316
But she couldn't see
past my size, pretended
I didn't even exist,

25:50.349 --> 25:52.785
and broke my heart.
Eh, what'd you
do about it?

25:52.819 --> 25:54.153
Starting working out,
eating right.

25:54.186 --> 25:55.087
I was a different man

25:55.121 --> 25:57.824
when I ran into Susie
years later.
Yeah,

25:57.857 --> 25:59.158
that must've felt
pretty good, huh?

25:59.191 --> 26:00.760
Yeah, yeah,
it did-- until...

26:00.793 --> 26:03.029
she told me that
she had a giant crush

26:03.062 --> 26:06.298
on me, too, but was afraid
of what her friends would say.

26:06.332 --> 26:08.267
Of course.
Yeah. And I realized,

26:08.300 --> 26:10.970
you know, that love
has the power to overcome

26:11.003 --> 26:12.204
almost anything,

26:12.238 --> 26:15.975
but only if we all can get past
our own prejudice and let it.

26:16.008 --> 26:18.611
Yeah. I'm gonna
keep this.

26:18.645 --> 26:20.913
No, you're not.
Let me just
keep it. Come on.

26:20.947 --> 26:23.816
And if you tell anybody
about it, you're a dead man.

26:23.850 --> 26:25.652
What, were you pushing,
two and a half

26:25.685 --> 26:27.353
in that
picture there?
Eh, maybe a deuce and a quarter.

26:27.386 --> 26:29.221
That's not bad.
Eh.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.629
(camera shutter clicking)

26:43.670 --> 26:45.672
*

26:59.952 --> 27:02.755
Serial numbers have
been filed down.

27:02.789 --> 27:04.891
Man was shot

27:04.924 --> 27:07.293
(gunshots)
in the back-- somehow the gun

27:07.326 --> 27:08.795
ended up underneath him.

27:08.828 --> 27:10.730
Doesn't make sense.

27:10.763 --> 27:12.098
Our vic is Jeremy Howser.

27:12.131 --> 27:12.965
Sounds familiar.

27:12.999 --> 27:14.767
It should.
He's been in the news lately.

27:14.801 --> 27:15.567
Howser was the CEO

27:15.601 --> 27:17.804
of some Fortune 500
investment firm.

27:17.837 --> 27:19.238
The SEC has been
investigating

27:19.271 --> 27:22.074
allegations that he defrauded
some of his clients.

27:22.108 --> 27:23.442
Surefire way to
make enemies.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.444
That wasn't the only
controversy in his life.

27:25.477 --> 27:28.314
He was also in the middle
of a very ugly divorce.

27:28.347 --> 27:30.182
We're talking millions in cash

27:30.216 --> 27:31.383
and assets at stake.

27:31.417 --> 27:33.352
And gives the wife
ample motive.

27:33.385 --> 27:36.355
Being here gave her
ample opportunity.

27:36.388 --> 27:38.057
That's her right there.

27:38.090 --> 27:39.692
Patrol picked her up

27:39.726 --> 27:42.361
fleeing the scene minutes
after the shooting.

27:42.394 --> 27:45.197
When I heard those gunshots
and saw Jeremy fall,

27:45.231 --> 27:46.465
I just panicked.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.367
I wasn't running
to get away,

27:48.400 --> 27:50.436
I was running to
save my own life.

27:50.469 --> 27:51.437
Did you see the shooter?

27:51.470 --> 27:54.473
Everything happened so fast.

27:54.506 --> 27:57.343
We understand that
you and your husband

27:57.376 --> 27:58.778
were in the middle of a highly

27:58.811 --> 28:02.048
contentious divorce.
Jeremy and I hadn't spoken
to each other in months.

28:02.081 --> 28:04.283
And what were you doing here
with him tonight?

28:04.316 --> 28:05.151
He called me

28:05.184 --> 28:07.887
out of the blue
this afternoon-- told me

28:07.920 --> 28:09.889
he wanted to meet
right away.
He say why?

28:09.922 --> 28:13.392
Only that he was tired
of fighting.

28:13.425 --> 28:16.262
That he wanted
to settle things like adults.

28:16.295 --> 28:18.430
It was my idea
to meet here.

28:18.464 --> 28:21.067
Just in case.

28:21.100 --> 28:23.402
In case of what?
I figured

28:23.435 --> 28:26.238
if we met in public,
he'd have to keep
things civilized.

28:26.272 --> 28:28.975
Sounds like you were
afraid of him.

28:29.008 --> 28:31.510
Jeremy had a temper, yes,

28:31.543 --> 28:34.781
but if you think
I would ever hurt him,

28:34.814 --> 28:36.248
you're wrong.

28:36.282 --> 28:39.752
I wanted free of him,
but not like this.

28:39.786 --> 28:41.788
(computer beeping)

28:43.255 --> 28:45.758
One of the rounds

28:45.792 --> 28:46.525
fragmented?

28:46.558 --> 28:48.494
Uh, both of them, actually.

28:48.527 --> 28:51.297
One from impacting
the mid-thoracic spine

28:51.330 --> 28:53.465
and the other from
contact with the lumbar.

28:53.499 --> 28:57.403
Bone and bullet fragments
ricocheted through his heart,

28:57.436 --> 29:00.406
proving fatal
almost instantaneously.

29:02.341 --> 29:04.443
Vic never saw it coming.

29:04.476 --> 29:07.413
This wasn't a murder, Sid,
it was an execution.

29:07.446 --> 29:09.849
Well, there's
something else. Uh...

29:09.882 --> 29:12.351
abrasions and contusions
on the knuckles

29:12.384 --> 29:15.187
with discoloration
and inflammation
of the metacarpals.

29:15.221 --> 29:17.223
TAYLOR:
Offensive wounds.

29:17.256 --> 29:19.391
I'd say our vic

29:19.425 --> 29:20.492
punched something.

29:20.526 --> 29:22.528
Or someone.
Uh, clotting

29:22.561 --> 29:25.898
is fresh, uh, suggesting
the injuries were sustained

29:25.932 --> 29:27.199
several hours prior

29:27.233 --> 29:30.002
to his being shot.
Any bruising or lacerations

29:30.036 --> 29:31.938
anywhere else on his body?

29:31.971 --> 29:34.373
None. If he was in a fight,

29:34.406 --> 29:36.876
it's likely our vic
was the aggressor.

29:36.909 --> 29:38.845
What's that?

29:43.282 --> 29:46.352
TAYLOR:
It looks like some kind
of ink stamp.

29:46.385 --> 29:49.521
Damn it, I...
I don't know how I missed it.

29:49.555 --> 29:51.423
Uh, sorry, Mac.

29:51.457 --> 29:54.126
It's okay, Sid--
once in eight years

29:54.160 --> 29:55.962
that you don't catch
something, it's still

29:55.995 --> 29:57.964
a perfect record,
as far as I'm concerned.

30:00.599 --> 30:01.868
Get some photos.

30:04.236 --> 30:06.906
*

30:21.120 --> 30:22.889
(beeping)

30:22.922 --> 30:24.123
(whirring)

30:28.094 --> 30:30.062
*

30:36.635 --> 30:39.571
Uh, it wasn't easy,
but I sorted the
bullet fragments

30:39.605 --> 30:42.174
that Sid retrieved,
and I was able to reconstruct

30:42.208 --> 30:43.575
one of the rounds.
Striae match

30:43.609 --> 30:45.477
the gun I found?
Not even close.

30:45.511 --> 30:47.079
Not even the same caliber.

30:47.113 --> 30:50.282
And the GSR swab
from Wendy Howser's hands,

30:50.316 --> 30:51.550
it came back negative.

30:51.583 --> 30:53.920
She did not shoot
her husband, Mac.

30:53.953 --> 30:55.054
Well, somebody did.

30:55.087 --> 30:58.657
Um, I'm running
the rounds through,

30:58.690 --> 31:00.626
uh, IBIS, and, uh,

31:00.659 --> 31:04.430
you know, when the system gets
a match, it will notify you.

31:04.463 --> 31:06.265
What, you going somewhere?
(laughs):
Oh...

31:06.298 --> 31:09.368
Well, y-you know
my girlfriend, Michelle.

31:09.401 --> 31:11.904
I mean, she has never
been ice-skating...

31:11.938 --> 31:13.605
Adam...
Sorry, you're right.
Okay, well,

31:13.639 --> 31:16.308
I got these VIP tickets
to the rink at the
Rockefeller Center, okay?

31:16.342 --> 31:19.645
But if I don't leave
literally in the next
ten minutes, it's over.

31:19.678 --> 31:21.914
You can go.
Oh, yes!

31:21.948 --> 31:24.383
Just as soon as you
figure out what this is.

31:24.416 --> 31:27.286
TAYLOR:
It's faded, so you may have
to enhance the detail

31:27.319 --> 31:28.354
before...
Hypodermic.

31:28.387 --> 31:30.056
It's a club
on the Lower East Side.

31:30.089 --> 31:32.058
You know, a lot
of indie bands,
pretty cool vibe.

31:32.091 --> 31:35.327
Yeah, they actually, um,
stamp your wrist when you're

31:35.361 --> 31:37.429
on the way out,
just in case you want
to come back in.

31:37.463 --> 31:40.232
(panting):
Yeah.

31:40.266 --> 31:42.001
Anything else?
Go.

31:42.034 --> 31:43.235
(speaking unintelligibly)

31:43.269 --> 31:44.636
You're so good to me.

31:44.670 --> 31:47.006
Sorry, that was
a little awkward. Sorry. Okay.

31:47.039 --> 31:49.008
I got to go.

31:49.041 --> 31:51.343
(beeping)

31:57.016 --> 31:58.951
(beep)

32:05.091 --> 32:06.358
Mac.

32:06.392 --> 32:08.094
Officer Thomas Reynolds,

32:08.127 --> 32:10.262
retired from the force in 2010

32:10.296 --> 32:13.532
six months after being
cleared in a justified
shooting case.

32:13.565 --> 32:15.968
Three years later,
he uses the same gun

32:16.002 --> 32:17.703
to shoot Jeremy Howser. Why?

32:17.736 --> 32:18.570
What's the connection

32:18.604 --> 32:21.673
between a retired cop
and crooked CEO?

32:21.707 --> 32:23.709
Reynolds runs a small
private-security firm.

32:23.742 --> 32:25.377
Couple part-time employees.

32:25.411 --> 32:26.745
Mostly short-term
protection services.

32:26.778 --> 32:27.946
But he did have one

32:27.980 --> 32:30.983
long-standing account with
a certain financial institution.

32:31.017 --> 32:32.084
Howser's investment firm.

32:32.118 --> 32:33.285
This gets better.

32:33.319 --> 32:34.753
Howser's assistant
heard them fighting

32:34.786 --> 32:36.255
in his office this morning.

32:36.288 --> 32:37.589
Didn't know what
it was about,

32:37.623 --> 32:39.191
but he said it got
mighty heated,

32:39.225 --> 32:40.359
and Reynolds left the building

32:40.392 --> 32:42.094
with a black eye
and a pink slip.

32:42.128 --> 32:44.063
Beat up and fired
in the same day.

32:44.096 --> 32:46.398
Reynolds followed Howser
to the outdoor market

32:46.432 --> 32:48.500
and got exactly what
he wanted-- revenge.

32:48.534 --> 32:50.469
(siren wailing)

32:50.502 --> 32:52.038
NYPD!

32:53.105 --> 32:54.373
Clear!

32:54.406 --> 32:55.641
Clear!

32:56.742 --> 32:58.744
Bedroom clear!

33:02.314 --> 33:03.782
Nobody's home.

33:03.815 --> 33:05.417
Reynolds knows protocol.

33:05.451 --> 33:06.985
Knew we'd be coming here first.

33:22.501 --> 33:24.436
TAYLOR:
Don. Look at this.

33:29.675 --> 33:31.210
FLACK:
Son of a bitch.

33:31.243 --> 33:32.744
We had this all wrong.

33:32.778 --> 33:35.481
TAYLOR:
Reynolds wasn't
following Jeremy Howser.

33:35.514 --> 33:38.217
He was doing surveillance
on Howser's wife.

33:53.665 --> 33:55.234
Mac.

33:56.602 --> 34:00.172
Gray sedan, east
side of the street.

34:29.635 --> 34:31.137
Reynolds.

34:31.170 --> 34:32.638
Down on your knees,
let me see your hands!

34:32.670 --> 34:33.739
He's got a gun.

34:33.772 --> 34:35.274
It's not loaded,
I swear.

34:35.306 --> 34:36.641
Don't move.

34:38.277 --> 34:39.411
You're under arrest

34:39.445 --> 34:41.780
for the murder of Jeremy Howser.

34:50.289 --> 34:51.690
I met Jeremy Howser
a few years back.

34:51.723 --> 34:54.193
He was looking for some
personal protection.

34:54.226 --> 34:55.460
Protection from what?

34:55.494 --> 34:58.597
His company made
some bad investments.

34:58.630 --> 35:01.133
Lost his clients
a boatload of money.

35:01.167 --> 35:02.468
Thought they'd
come after him.

35:02.501 --> 35:03.602
Did they?
No.

35:03.635 --> 35:06.538
But Howser thought that
everybody was out to get him,

35:06.572 --> 35:07.473
especially his wife.

35:07.506 --> 35:09.641
Wendy, she tried
to fix things between them,

35:09.675 --> 35:11.743
but the damage was done.

35:11.777 --> 35:14.146
So, she filed
for divorce.

35:14.180 --> 35:15.814
After that, he made it

35:15.847 --> 35:18.384
his mission in life
to punish her.

35:19.885 --> 35:22.721
But he needed your
help to do it.

35:22.754 --> 35:24.690
FLACK:
So, he had you looking
for dirt on Wendy.

35:25.957 --> 35:29.495
Anything he could use
as leverage against her.

35:29.528 --> 35:31.930
But instead, what I found

35:31.963 --> 35:35.501
was the kindest,
most selfless individual

35:35.534 --> 35:37.436
I'd ever seen.

35:37.469 --> 35:39.505
And I watched
Wendy volunteering

35:39.538 --> 35:42.641
at hospitals,
and-and homeless shelters

35:42.674 --> 35:44.743
over and over,
giving her time and money

35:44.776 --> 35:46.678
to those less privileged.

35:46.712 --> 35:49.281
She was an incredible woman,

35:49.315 --> 35:52.184
and that's exactly
what I told Jeremy.

35:52.218 --> 35:54.820
Your services are

35:54.853 --> 35:55.821
no longer required.

35:55.854 --> 35:57.556
I'm gonna handle things myself.

35:57.589 --> 35:58.790
I don't want your money.

35:58.824 --> 36:00.859
I just want you to
leave Wendy alone.

36:00.892 --> 36:02.594
Let her move on
with her life, man.

36:02.628 --> 36:03.729
It's what she deserves.

36:05.797 --> 36:07.799
I'll decide
what Wendy deserves!

36:07.833 --> 36:09.435
Not the lawyers!

36:09.468 --> 36:10.602
Not you!

36:10.636 --> 36:13.239
Her life belongs to me.

36:13.272 --> 36:15.341
REYNOLDS:
Man, it took everything

36:15.374 --> 36:17.609
inside of me
not to hit him back.

36:17.643 --> 36:19.511
And that was the moment
that I realized

36:19.545 --> 36:20.812
that he was gonna kill his wife.

36:20.846 --> 36:22.514
You should have gone
to the police.

36:22.548 --> 36:23.649
With what evidence?

36:23.682 --> 36:24.983
It was my word against his.

36:25.016 --> 36:26.952
FLACK:
So you followed
Wendy instead.

36:41.467 --> 36:43.735
REYNOLDS:
He was going to shoot her.

36:43.769 --> 36:45.437
I didn't have time to think.

36:45.471 --> 36:46.838
I just reacted.

36:50.776 --> 36:52.811
(gunshots)
(grunts, bystanders screaming)

36:54.045 --> 36:56.748
(indistinct yelling)

36:58.817 --> 37:01.420
I was protecting
an innocent life.

37:01.453 --> 37:03.355
Exactly what I was
trained to do.
You were also

37:03.389 --> 37:05.291
trained to take responsibility
for your actions,

37:05.324 --> 37:07.359
not run from the scene
of a crime.

37:07.393 --> 37:08.860
It was stupid, I know.

37:08.894 --> 37:10.362
I panicked.

37:12.631 --> 37:15.267
So, why'd you finally
decide to turn yourself in?

37:15.301 --> 37:18.570
'Cause I thought about Wendy.

37:18.604 --> 37:21.407
The type of person that she is.

37:21.440 --> 37:24.510
And I realized that
that's the type of person

37:24.543 --> 37:26.878
that I wanted to be, too.

37:26.912 --> 37:29.281
It's probably too late
for that, now.

37:29.315 --> 37:31.049
Jeremy's the only other person

37:31.082 --> 37:32.818
that can corroborate that story,

37:32.851 --> 37:35.654
and he damn sure ain't talking.

37:35.687 --> 37:37.556
He doesn't have to.

37:39.791 --> 37:41.927
Not only did he buy
a gun off the street,

37:41.960 --> 37:43.595
Howser stopped at a club

37:43.629 --> 37:45.497
on his way to
meet his wife.

37:45.531 --> 37:47.299
Stayed less than
ten minutes,

37:47.333 --> 37:49.468
then got his hand stamped
so he could come back later.

37:49.501 --> 37:50.636
FLACK:
And, just in case

37:50.669 --> 37:52.771
his alibi for the
time of the shooting
didn't work out,

37:52.804 --> 37:55.807
he also bought himself
a one-way ticket to Geneva.

37:57.609 --> 37:59.811
TAYLOR:
Seems he had his wife's
murder all figured out.

37:59.845 --> 38:02.548
The only thing
he didn't count on....

38:02.581 --> 38:03.849
was your

38:03.882 --> 38:06.284
selfless act.

38:10.722 --> 38:12.724
(siren wails)

38:15.461 --> 38:18.464
("Happy in My Heartache"
playing)

38:35.080 --> 38:40.819
* Coffee is on the table,
and I *

38:40.852 --> 38:42.421
* Just can't seem

38:42.454 --> 38:44.590
* To wake up this
aching heart of mine *

38:44.623 --> 38:46.692
You're absolutely breathtaking.

38:46.725 --> 38:49.127
* One more day without you

38:49.160 --> 38:53.565
* And I'll be fine

38:53.599 --> 38:55.667
* Know I'm good for waiting

38:55.701 --> 38:59.838
* But waiting's wasted time

38:59.871 --> 39:01.707
* Oh, and I

39:01.740 --> 39:04.943
* I don't take it lightly

39:04.976 --> 39:06.912
* The trouble that
I've gone through *

39:06.945 --> 39:08.079
This is for you.

39:08.113 --> 39:09.448
(Christine laughs)

39:09.481 --> 39:11.683
* To get you to know who I am

39:11.717 --> 39:13.952
* Oh, and I

39:13.985 --> 39:17.789
* I can't find the reason...

39:17.823 --> 39:20.692
How do you always know
the exact right thing to say?

39:20.726 --> 39:23.995
It's easy, Christine.

39:24.029 --> 39:26.865
'Cause I love you.

39:31.637 --> 39:33.872
* Wicked winds are blowing

39:33.905 --> 39:37.175
* Through the halls

39:37.208 --> 39:39.845
* These old familiar faces

39:39.878 --> 39:43.649
* Are clinging to the walls

39:43.682 --> 39:48.954
* I know it's cold,
but I can't feel at all *

39:48.987 --> 39:52.123
* And I know these walls
are crumbling *

39:52.157 --> 39:55.994
* I won't stay
to watch them fall *

39:56.027 --> 39:58.497
* Oh, and I

39:58.530 --> 40:01.633
* I don't take it lightly

40:01.667 --> 40:04.636
* The trouble that
I've gone through *

40:04.670 --> 40:07.906
* To get you to know who I am

40:07.939 --> 40:10.976
* Oh, and I

40:11.009 --> 40:13.178
* I can't find a reason...

40:13.211 --> 40:14.980
LINDSAY:
Do you even remember
the last time

40:15.013 --> 40:16.948
that we had
five minutes together?

40:16.982 --> 40:17.983
Uh, yup.

40:18.016 --> 40:19.485
Thursday, in the A.V. lab.

40:19.518 --> 40:22.053
It was fantastic
until Adam showed up.

40:23.188 --> 40:25.524
Seriously, though,
between Lucy and work,

40:25.557 --> 40:28.560
I feel like we don't
even see each other any more.

40:28.594 --> 40:29.561
And, it's about

40:29.595 --> 40:30.996
to get a lot harder.

40:31.029 --> 40:31.863
(groans)

40:31.897 --> 40:33.999
It's also about to
get a lot better.

40:34.032 --> 40:35.233
There's my little boy.

40:35.266 --> 40:36.568
(Lindsay giggles)

40:36.602 --> 40:39.170
Well...

40:39.204 --> 40:40.706
Lucy's asleep, now.

40:40.739 --> 40:43.241
And work is done, so...

40:43.274 --> 40:46.044
you know, maybe...

40:46.077 --> 40:47.646
I told you

40:47.679 --> 40:48.880
we'd have a little
time to celebrate.

40:48.914 --> 40:50.181
(giggles)

40:50.215 --> 40:51.883
LUCY:
Mommy, Mommy!

40:51.917 --> 40:53.051
There's a vampire

40:53.084 --> 40:55.053
(Lindsay laughs)
under my bed!

40:56.522 --> 40:57.989
I got it.

41:00.692 --> 41:02.027
* Oh, and I

41:02.060 --> 41:05.664
* I don't take it lightly

41:05.697 --> 41:08.033
* The trouble that
I've gone through *

41:08.066 --> 41:10.536
* To get you to know who I am

41:10.569 --> 41:11.603
Hi, Mom.

41:11.637 --> 41:12.638
(gasps)

41:12.671 --> 41:14.172
Ellie.

41:14.205 --> 41:15.874
What are you
doing here?

41:15.907 --> 41:17.042
I though you were
out with Andrew.

41:17.075 --> 41:19.077
I told him I was
coming down with a cold.

41:19.110 --> 41:19.845
But you've been
looking forward

41:19.878 --> 41:21.713
to this date for weeks.
I know,

41:21.747 --> 41:24.015
I just changed my mind,
that's all.

41:24.049 --> 41:26.084
I thought maybe
you and I could

41:26.117 --> 41:28.186
make some, uh, double fudge,
death-by-chocolate

41:28.219 --> 41:30.656
ice cream sundaes,
instead, hmm?

41:30.689 --> 41:32.724
Watch one of these
little sappy movies?

41:34.960 --> 41:36.595
Okay, does this have
anything to do

41:36.628 --> 41:38.864
with your poor mom
flying solo

41:38.897 --> 41:39.931
on Valentine's Day?

41:39.965 --> 41:42.267
I have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

41:42.300 --> 41:43.869
Ellie Danville.

41:43.902 --> 41:46.271
(chuckles)

41:46.304 --> 41:48.540
Aw, you are becoming

41:48.574 --> 41:51.042
the most amazing
young lady.

41:51.076 --> 41:52.277
Yeah, yeah.

41:52.310 --> 41:54.012
Tell me something I don't know.

41:54.045 --> 41:55.046
Here's something.

41:55.080 --> 41:57.048
I get to pick
the movie.

41:57.082 --> 41:59.551
(laughs)
No, you don't.

42:02.120 --> 42:05.123
* I don't what to do

42:05.156 --> 42:07.993
* To keep holding on...

42:08.026 --> 42:09.027
LOVATO:
Why are we in here?

42:09.060 --> 42:10.629
It smells like...

42:10.662 --> 42:12.564
I don't know what it smells
like, but it's bad.

42:12.598 --> 42:14.032
Suck it up, Lovato,
we're almost there.

42:14.065 --> 42:15.701
Can't you just tell me
where we're going?

42:15.734 --> 42:17.936
No.
Fine.

42:17.969 --> 42:20.639
But these heels are way too sexy

42:20.672 --> 42:23.041
for a stinky stairwell.

42:31.016 --> 42:32.984
You didn't forget
Valentine's Day, did you?

42:33.018 --> 42:34.319
Are you kidding me?

42:34.352 --> 42:35.921
It's my favorite holiday.

42:35.954 --> 42:37.989
After Arbor Day, that is.

42:38.023 --> 42:39.057
You're crazy,
you know that?

42:39.090 --> 42:40.992
And very thoughtful.

42:41.026 --> 42:42.828
So, does that mean

42:42.861 --> 42:43.962
that, uh...

42:43.995 --> 42:45.664
sentimental crap
does make you swoon?

42:45.697 --> 42:48.033
Maybe a little bit.

42:51.136 --> 42:52.904
Dinner's getting cold.

42:52.938 --> 42:54.840
I don't care.

42:56.942 --> 42:58.209
What are we doing, Flack?

42:58.243 --> 43:00.145
I mean, what is this?

43:00.178 --> 43:03.048
It's whatever we want it to be.

43:03.081 --> 43:05.250
Doesn't really matter
what we call it, does it?

43:06.752 --> 43:08.086
You're going to have to meet
my brothers soon.

43:08.119 --> 43:09.087
Bring 'em on.

43:09.120 --> 43:11.189
They're a tough crowd.

43:11.222 --> 43:12.991
Especially when they meet
my boyfriends.

43:13.024 --> 43:15.060
Do I look worried?

43:15.093 --> 43:16.127
They're gonna love me.

43:16.161 --> 43:18.096
Yeah, they will.

43:18.129 --> 43:20.131
* I can't find a reason

43:20.165 --> 43:23.635
* To be happy in my heartache

43:23.669 --> 43:26.171
* 'Cause I should
know better than that *

43:26.204 --> 43:31.109
* Oh, I'm better than that.
