00:15.839 --> 00:17.517
Danger!

00:17.519 --> 00:19.237
This is a warning.

00:19.239 --> 00:21.557
A warning to the whole world.

00:21.559 --> 00:23.199
You're looking for Wi-Fi.

00:27.999 --> 00:30.079
And sometimes you see something...

00:31.719 --> 00:34.079
A bit like this.

00:38.319 --> 00:41.239
Don't click it.
Do. Not. Click. It.

00:43.959 --> 00:46.997
Once you've clicked it,
they're in your computer.

00:46.999 --> 00:49.279
They can see you.

00:50.599 --> 00:53.637
And if they can see you,
they might choose you.

00:53.639 --> 00:55.277
And if they do...

00:55.279 --> 00:56.679
you die.

00:58.279 --> 01:00.437
Within 24 hours, you're dead.

01:00.439 --> 01:02.677
For a while.

01:02.679 --> 01:05.597
People's souls are being
uploaded to the internet.

01:05.599 --> 01:09.917
Some people get stuck. Their minds,
their souls, trapped in the Wi-Fi.

01:09.919 --> 01:11.957
Like echoes. Like ghosts.

01:11.959 --> 01:13.437
I don't know where I am!

01:13.439 --> 01:15.357
Sometimes you can
hear their screams.

01:15.359 --> 01:18.677
On the radio. On the telly.
On the net.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.317
I don't know where I am!

01:20.319 --> 01:21.837
I don't know where I am!

01:21.839 --> 01:23.397
This is real. This is not a hoax.

01:23.399 --> 01:25.077
I, I don't know where I am!

01:25.079 --> 01:26.117
Or a joke.

01:26.119 --> 01:27.157
Doko?

01:27.159 --> 01:28.957
Or a story.
I don't know where I am!

01:28.959 --> 01:33.077
This is real and I know that,
because...

01:33.079 --> 01:35.117
I don't know where I am.

01:35.119 --> 01:39.599
Please, if you can hear me...

01:40.959 --> 01:42.237
If you can hear me,

01:42.239 --> 01:44.597
I don't know where I am.

01:44.599 --> 01:48.797
I don't know where I am!
I don't know where I am!

01:48.799 --> 01:51.879
I don't know where I am!
I don't know where I am!

02:39.199 --> 02:43.159
Wake the Abbott.
The bells of Saint John are ringing!

02:50.799 --> 02:52.399
We must go to him!

03:00.439 --> 03:02.717
They call him the mad monk,
don't they?

03:02.719 --> 03:05.719
They shouldn't.
He's definitely not a monk.

03:10.359 --> 03:14.279
I'm sorry to intrude.
The bells of Saint John are ringing.

03:22.279 --> 03:24.439
I'm going to need a horse!

03:35.279 --> 03:37.597
Is that her?

03:37.599 --> 03:41.999
The woman twice dead,
and her final message.

03:43.559 --> 03:48.117
He has withdrawn to this
place of peace and solitude

03:48.119 --> 03:50.557
that he might divine her meaning.

03:50.559 --> 03:54.439
If he truly is mad,
then this is his madness.

03:58.519 --> 04:00.437
Angie, is the internet working?

04:00.439 --> 04:02.757
Trying to phone the helpline,
they won't answer.

04:02.759 --> 04:05.197
It's working for me.
Can I use it when you're finished?

04:05.199 --> 04:07.917
More than one person can use
the internet at a time, Clara.

04:07.919 --> 04:10.317
You done your homework?
Shut up, you're not my mum!

04:10.319 --> 04:12.159
And I'm not trying to be. OK?

04:13.399 --> 04:17.197
Right, yes!
Angie's probably fine on her own,

04:17.199 --> 04:19.237
you could probably have the
night off.

04:19.238 --> 04:22.036
I'm OK, I'll be upstairs trying to
figure out my computer.

04:22.039 --> 04:24.797
Anyway, the adverts are in,
so hopefully we'll find someone.

04:24.799 --> 04:26.997
I'm here as long as you need me.

04:26.999 --> 04:29.679
Good! Right,
come on, Artie, time to go.

04:30.959 --> 04:32.357
What chapter you on?

04:32.359 --> 04:35.757
Ten. 11's the best.
You'll cry your eyes out.

04:35.759 --> 04:37.279
Artie!

04:39.599 --> 04:45.039
Oh, come on, just answer, just pick
it up, pick it up, pick it up.

05:36.279 --> 05:38.919
That is not supposed to happen.

05:53.519 --> 05:54.877
Hello?

05:54.879 --> 05:57.477
Ah, hello.
I can't find the internet.

05:57.479 --> 06:01.597
I'm sorry? It's gone, the internet.
Can't find it anywhere. Where is it?

06:01.599 --> 06:02.797
The internet?

06:02.799 --> 06:05.679
Yes, the internet.
Why don't I have the internet?

06:08.879 --> 06:10.437
It's 1207.

06:10.439 --> 06:14.357
I've got 3.30.
Am I phoning a different time zone?

06:14.359 --> 06:15.997
Yeah, you really sort of are.

06:15.999 --> 06:17.357
Will it show up on the bill?

06:17.359 --> 06:20.557
Oh, I dread to think. Listen,
where did you get this number?

06:20.559 --> 06:22.237
Woman in the shop wrote it down.

06:22.239 --> 06:24.557
It's the helpline, isn't it?
She said it was the best

06:24.559 --> 06:26.757
helpline out there.
In the universe, she said.

06:26.759 --> 06:28.397
What woman? Who was she?

06:28.399 --> 06:30.757
I dunno, the woman in the shop.

06:30.759 --> 06:32.517
So why isn't there internet?

06:32.519 --> 06:35.317
Shouldn't it just
sort of... be there?

06:35.319 --> 06:38.119
Look, listen,
I'm not actually... this isn't...

06:39.679 --> 06:41.997
You have clicked on the Wi-Fi
button, haven't you?

06:41.999 --> 06:43.399
Hang on. Erm...

06:44.679 --> 06:47.679
Wi-Fi?

06:49.479 --> 06:50.757
Click on the Wi-Fi.

06:50.759 --> 06:53.637
You'll see a list of names.
Is there one you recognise?

06:53.639 --> 06:55.277
It's asking me for a password.

06:55.279 --> 06:57.517
Is it OK if I go and see Nina?
You can call her mum.

06:57.519 --> 07:00.277
Sure. What's
the password for the internet?

07:00.279 --> 07:02.037
Rycbar123.

07:02.039 --> 07:04.039
How am I supposed to remember that?

07:06.919 --> 07:08.317
Is it an evil spirit?

07:08.319 --> 07:09.679
It's a woman.

07:11.039 --> 07:17.679
Hang on. Just a mo. Run. You. Clever.
Boy. And. Remember.

07:18.719 --> 07:21.797
One!

07:21.799 --> 07:24.037
Run, you clever boy.

07:24.039 --> 07:26.397
Two!

07:26.399 --> 07:28.037
And remember.

07:28.039 --> 07:29.637
Three!

07:29.639 --> 07:30.719
What did you say?

07:31.999 --> 07:34.397
Don't shout, you made me
type it wrong.

07:34.399 --> 07:37.639
It's thrown me out again.
What do I do, how do I get back in?

07:51.959 --> 07:55.317
It was just a thing
to remember the password.

07:55.319 --> 07:59.759
Run, you clever boy and remember.
Oh, hang on!

08:08.519 --> 08:11.679
Hello, yes, I hear you.

08:13.479 --> 08:15.559
Yep. Uh-huh. Hello?

08:16.639 --> 08:20.077
Clara? Clara Oswald?

08:20.079 --> 08:22.237
Hello? Clara Oswin Oswald?

08:22.239 --> 08:24.837
Just Clara Oswald.
What was that middle one?

08:24.839 --> 08:26.477
Do you remember me?

08:26.479 --> 08:29.997
No. Should I? Who are you?

08:29.999 --> 08:32.958
The Doctor. No? The Doctor?

08:34.119 --> 08:35.397
Doctor who?

08:35.399 --> 08:37.636
No, just the Doctor.

08:37.639 --> 08:40.116
Actually, sorry,
could you just ask me that again?

08:40.119 --> 08:43.756
Could I what? Could you just ask me
that question again? Doctor who?

08:43.759 --> 08:45.197
OK, just once more.

08:45.199 --> 08:46.717
Doctor who?

08:46.719 --> 08:48.997
Oh, yeah. Oh!

08:48.999 --> 08:51.037
D'you know, I never realised

08:51.039 --> 08:54.117
how much I enjoy hearing that said
out loud.

08:54.119 --> 08:55.717
Thank you. OK.

08:55.719 --> 09:00.599
Hey, no! Clara, please.
Clara, I need to talk to you!

09:03.159 --> 09:05.157
Listen, please.

09:05.159 --> 09:06.917
Clara Oswald.

09:06.919 --> 09:10.437
We've got a positive lock on her,
but I think she's borderline.

09:10.439 --> 09:12.637
Very clever,
but no computer skills.

09:12.639 --> 09:15.437
Upload her anyway, splice her
a computer skills package.

09:15.439 --> 09:17.317
I'll activate a Spoonhead.

09:17.319 --> 09:20.317
Alexei, we call them servers,
not Spoonheads.

09:20.319 --> 09:22.079
Sorry, Miss Kizlet.

09:23.519 --> 09:25.557
I'm ever so fond of Alexei,

09:25.559 --> 09:28.957
but my conscience says
we should probably kill him.

09:28.959 --> 09:30.597
I'll inform HR.

09:30.599 --> 09:32.597
Actually, he's about to
go on holiday.

09:32.599 --> 09:36.077
Kill him when he gets back,
let's not be unreasonable.

09:36.079 --> 09:38.077
Didn't you want to speak to me?

09:38.079 --> 09:41.877
We're uploading too many people, too
quickly. We're going to get noticed.

09:41.879 --> 09:44.877
If your conscience is bothering you,
think of it like this.

09:44.879 --> 09:49.757
We're preserving living minds,
in permanent form in the data cloud.

09:49.759 --> 09:52.877
It's like immortality. Only fatal.

09:52.879 --> 09:54.397
My conscience is fine.

09:54.399 --> 09:57.599
Good.
Because our client has his needs.

10:07.399 --> 10:08.997
Did you just hack me?

10:08.999 --> 10:11.077
Because you changed your mind?

10:11.079 --> 10:13.279
I hope I did.

10:23.919 --> 10:27.039
Please! I just need to speak to you!

10:35.559 --> 10:38.237
Why are you still here?
Why are you here at all?

10:38.239 --> 10:40.717
You phoned me.
You were looking for the internet.

10:40.719 --> 10:43.157
That was you? Course it was me.

10:43.159 --> 10:44.797
How did you get here so fast?

10:44.799 --> 10:47.917
I just happened to be in the
neighbourhood. On my mobile phone.

10:47.919 --> 10:50.957
When you say "mobile phone",
why do you point at that blue box?

10:50.959 --> 10:54.077
Because it's a surprisingly
accurate description.

10:54.079 --> 10:55.717
OK, we're finished now.

10:55.719 --> 10:57.679
Oi, no, look...

11:05.639 --> 11:06.919
Angie?

11:08.479 --> 11:10.079
Angie, are you upstairs?

11:11.879 --> 11:13.719
Angie, are you still here?

11:30.559 --> 11:32.077
Hello.

11:32.079 --> 11:33.599
Hello.

11:35.119 --> 11:36.719
Are you a friend of Angie's?

11:38.999 --> 11:40.719
I'm a friend of Angie's.

11:42.079 --> 11:43.479
What where you doing upstairs?

11:45.239 --> 11:46.639
I was upstairs.

11:50.879 --> 11:53.357
I know you, don't I?

11:53.359 --> 11:56.119
You know me... don't you?

12:24.039 --> 12:26.279
Right, don't be a monk.

12:29.159 --> 12:32.039
Monks are not cool!

12:38.599 --> 12:40.679
Ah-ha!

13:07.199 --> 13:08.757
Clara?

13:08.759 --> 13:10.997
Clara?

13:10.999 --> 13:12.357
Hello?

13:12.359 --> 13:14.517
See? Look, it's me! De-monked.

13:14.519 --> 13:17.357
Sensible clothes.
Erm, can I come in now?

13:17.359 --> 13:18.997
I don't understand.

13:18.999 --> 13:21.077
Could you just open the door?
I don't know...

13:21.079 --> 13:22.677
Of course you can!

13:22.679 --> 13:25.477
Where I am.

13:25.479 --> 13:28.157
I don't know where I am.

13:28.159 --> 13:31.357
Where am I?
Please tell me, where I am!

13:31.359 --> 13:34.237
I don't know where I am.
I don't know where I am!

13:34.239 --> 13:36.959
Clara! Clara?

13:38.999 --> 13:41.237
I don't know where I am!

13:41.239 --> 13:43.957
I don't understand.
I don't know where I am!

13:43.959 --> 13:47.639
I don't know where I am! I don't
understand! I don't know where I am!

13:49.239 --> 13:51.919
Where am I?
I don't know where I am.

13:53.679 --> 13:55.559
I don't know where I am.

14:03.879 --> 14:05.319
I've got a problem!

14:12.879 --> 14:14.677
A walking base station.

14:14.679 --> 14:18.157
A walking Wi-Fi base station,
hoovering up data.

14:18.159 --> 14:20.359
Hoovering up people!

14:22.719 --> 14:24.679
Oh, no, you don't.

14:29.639 --> 14:32.157
Oh, no, you don't.

14:32.159 --> 14:34.397
It's like someone is trying to
reverse an upload.

14:34.399 --> 14:35.837
Is that possible?

14:35.839 --> 14:38.999
If the upload isn't fully
integrated yet - in theory, yes.

14:44.439 --> 14:46.159
Oh, my God.

14:48.399 --> 14:50.997
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

14:50.999 --> 14:53.799
Not this time, Clara, I promise you.

15:02.399 --> 15:04.319
Can you stop this?

15:05.679 --> 15:07.039
No!

15:28.159 --> 15:33.037
It's OK, it's OK. You're fine,
you're back. Yes, you are.

15:33.039 --> 15:34.839
Yes, you are.

15:41.319 --> 15:42.597
Well?

15:42.599 --> 15:44.239
Our hacker sent us a message.

15:49.119 --> 15:51.799
I assume he's
talking about the girl.

15:52.839 --> 15:56.039
Get out.
I have to speak to the client.

16:08.079 --> 16:12.877
Sir. The one you told me about.
He's here.

16:12.879 --> 16:14.959
The Doctor is here.

18:05.959 --> 18:07.597
Hello?

18:07.599 --> 18:11.557
Hello. Are you all right?

18:11.559 --> 18:13.077
I'm in bed.

18:13.079 --> 18:15.197
Yes. Don't remember going. No.

18:15.199 --> 18:16.717
What did I miss?

18:16.719 --> 18:18.997
Oh, quite a lot, actually.

18:18.999 --> 18:22.037
Angie called,
she's going to stay over at Nina's.

18:22.039 --> 18:24.637
Apparently that's all completely
fine and you shouldn't

18:24.639 --> 18:27.477
worry like you always do,
for God's sake, get off her back.

18:27.479 --> 18:30.197
Also, your dad phoned.
Mainly about the government.

18:30.199 --> 18:33.117
He seems very cross with them,
I've got several pages on that.

18:33.119 --> 18:34.397
I said I'd look into it.

18:34.399 --> 18:36.597
I fixed that rattling noise in
the washing machine,

18:36.599 --> 18:39.397
indexed the kitchen cupboards,
optimised the photosynthesis

18:39.399 --> 18:41.717
in the main flowerbed
and assembled the quadrocycle.

18:41.719 --> 18:43.037
Assembled the what?

18:43.039 --> 18:45.237
I found a disassembled
quadrocycle in the garage.

18:45.239 --> 18:46.759
I don't think you did.

18:47.959 --> 18:49.999
I invented the quadrocycle!

18:54.199 --> 18:56.357
What happened to me?

18:56.359 --> 18:57.959
Don't you remember?

19:00.119 --> 19:03.237
I was scared. Really scared.

19:03.239 --> 19:05.597
I didn't know where I was.

19:05.599 --> 19:07.837
Do you know now?

19:07.839 --> 19:09.517
Yes.

19:09.519 --> 19:15.837
Well, then, you should go to sleep,
because you're safe now, I promise.

19:15.839 --> 19:17.959
Goodnight, Clara.

19:28.439 --> 19:30.077
Are you guarding me?

19:30.079 --> 19:33.519
Well, yes. Yes, I am.

19:35.839 --> 19:38.357
Are you seriously going
to sit down there all night?

19:38.359 --> 19:41.917
Yes. I promise.
I won't budge from this spot.

19:41.919 --> 19:44.677
Well, then. I'll have to come to you.

19:44.679 --> 19:46.039
Eh?

19:50.759 --> 19:53.317
I take it the girl's inside.
And alive?

19:53.319 --> 19:55.477
Yes.

19:55.479 --> 20:00.159
Alexei, I need you to do something
creative about that.

20:07.359 --> 20:08.717
I like your house.

20:08.719 --> 20:11.357
It isn't mine,
I'm a friend of the family.

20:11.359 --> 20:12.797
Do you look after the kids?

20:12.799 --> 20:15.077
Oh yes, you're a governess,
aren't you, just like...

20:15.079 --> 20:17.037
Just like what?

20:17.039 --> 20:18.239
Just like...

20:19.599 --> 20:21.157
I thought you probably would be.

20:21.159 --> 20:23.719
Are you going to explain
what happened to me?

20:26.679 --> 20:29.637
There's something in the Wi-Fi.

20:29.639 --> 20:32.637
OK. This whole world
is swimming in Wi-Fi.

20:32.639 --> 20:36.037
We're living in a Wi-Fi soup!
Suppose something got inside it.

20:36.039 --> 20:38.757
Suppose there was something
living in the Wi-Fi,

20:38.759 --> 20:42.159
harvesting human minds,
extracting them.

20:43.439 --> 20:45.677
Imagine that.

20:45.679 --> 20:49.677
Human souls trapped like flies
in the World Wide Web,

20:49.679 --> 20:54.079
stuck for ever, crying out for help.

20:55.519 --> 20:57.319
Isn't that basically Twitter?

21:03.999 --> 21:05.357
What's that face for?

21:05.359 --> 21:07.837
A computer can
hack another computer.

21:07.839 --> 21:10.557
A living, sentient computer...

21:10.559 --> 21:13.277
Maybe that could that hack people.
Edit them. Rewrite them.

21:13.279 --> 21:14.517
Why would you say that?

21:14.519 --> 21:17.197
Because a few hours ago you knew
nothing about the internet.

21:17.199 --> 21:20.317
And you just made
a joke about Twitter.

21:20.319 --> 21:21.599
Oh.

21:22.839 --> 21:25.717
Oh. That's weird.

21:25.719 --> 21:29.077
I know all about computers now
in my head.

21:29.079 --> 21:30.477
Where did that come from?

21:30.479 --> 21:32.517
You were uploaded for a while.

21:32.519 --> 21:35.757
Wherever you were,
you brought something extra back.

21:35.759 --> 21:39.959
Which I very much doubt
you're going to be allowed to keep.

21:48.199 --> 21:51.597
You and me, inside that box, now.
I'm sorry?

21:51.599 --> 21:54.517
Just get inside. Both of us?

21:54.519 --> 21:57.717
Trust me, you'll understand
once we're in there.

21:57.719 --> 21:59.517
I bet I will! Clara, please!

21:59.519 --> 22:01.757
What is that box, anyway?
Why do you have a box?

22:01.759 --> 22:03.877
Clara! Is it like a snogging booth?

22:03.879 --> 22:06.837
A what?! Is that what you do,
you bring a booth?

22:06.839 --> 22:08.719
There's such a thing as too keen.

22:12.639 --> 22:14.919
Clara, look around you!

22:25.679 --> 22:28.757
What's going on?
Is the Wi-Fi switching on the lights?

22:28.759 --> 22:30.957
No. The people are switching
on the lights.

22:30.959 --> 22:33.199
The Wi-Fi is
switching on the people.

22:40.119 --> 22:41.677
What is that thing?

22:41.679 --> 22:44.077
A walking base station,
you saw one earlier.

22:44.079 --> 22:45.317
I saw a little girl.

22:45.319 --> 22:49.277
Must have taken an image from your
subconscious, thrown it back at you.

22:49.279 --> 22:51.199
Active camouflage!

22:53.119 --> 22:55.319
They could be everywhere!

22:58.839 --> 23:01.159
Doctor! Doctor!

23:02.999 --> 23:04.799
What's going on?

23:06.519 --> 23:09.077
Do we need another London-wide
activation?

23:09.079 --> 23:11.079
We can't always
pass it off as a riot.

23:13.279 --> 23:15.999
All our lights on,
everyone else's off. Why?

23:17.999 --> 23:20.197
Some planes have Wi-Fi.

23:20.199 --> 23:21.797
I'm sorry?

23:21.799 --> 23:24.159
We must be one hell of
a target right now.

23:26.879 --> 23:29.159
You, me, box, now!

23:31.439 --> 23:33.757
Yes, it's a spaceship.
Yes, it's bigger on the inside.

23:33.759 --> 23:36.117
No, I don't have time
to talk about it.

23:36.119 --> 23:39.757
But... but... but... it's...

23:39.759 --> 23:42.197
Shut up, please,
short hops are difficult.

23:42.199 --> 23:44.959
Bigger. On the inside.
Actually bigger.

23:46.439 --> 23:49.397
Right, come on!
Are we going back out there?

23:49.399 --> 23:53.197
We've moved.
It's a spaceship, we flew away.

23:53.199 --> 23:54.999
Away from the plane? Not exactly!

23:58.399 --> 23:59.957
How did we get here?

23:59.959 --> 24:02.957
It's a ship, I told you,
it's all very sciency!

24:02.959 --> 24:06.397
Is this the plane, the actual plane?
Are they all dead?

24:06.399 --> 24:10.519
Asleep, switched off by the Wi-Fi,
never mind them!

24:21.159 --> 24:25.117
What is going on? Is this real?
Please tell me what is happening!

24:25.119 --> 24:27.437
I'm the Doctor.
I'm an alien from outer space.

24:27.439 --> 24:29.597
I'm 1,000 years old.
I've got two hearts.

24:29.599 --> 24:31.157
And I can't fly a plane, can you?

24:31.159 --> 24:32.397
No!

24:32.399 --> 24:34.199
Fine, let's do it together.

24:57.359 --> 24:59.837
Do you think a victory roll
would be too show-offy?

24:59.839 --> 25:01.437
What the hell's going on?

25:01.439 --> 25:04.557
Well, I'm blocking your Wi-Fi,
so you're waking up for a start.

25:04.559 --> 25:06.919
Tell you what, do you want to drive?

25:13.759 --> 25:19.159
I don't understand what's happened.
That box, where's it gone?

25:21.279 --> 25:23.719
Find that box!

25:26.639 --> 25:30.677
OK. When are you going to explain
what the hell is going on?

25:30.679 --> 25:32.797
Breakfast.

25:32.799 --> 25:35.517
What?
I ain't waiting till breakfast.

25:35.519 --> 25:39.359
It's a time machine. You never have
to wait for breakfast.

25:43.599 --> 25:46.357
Thank you, thank you.
Yes, magic blue box.

25:46.359 --> 25:50.757
All donations gratefully accepted.
Roll up, roll up, give us your dosh.

25:50.759 --> 25:53.277
Pennies, pounds,
anything you've got.

25:53.279 --> 25:55.357
Keep collecting,
we need enough for breakfast.

25:55.359 --> 25:57.239
Just popping back to the garage.

25:58.519 --> 25:59.959
Garage?

26:08.999 --> 26:10.677
This way.

26:10.679 --> 26:14.877
So, this is tomorrow, then?
Tomorrow's come early.

26:14.879 --> 26:18.437
No, it came at the usual time.
We just took a short cut.

26:18.439 --> 26:23.479
Thank you, thank you.
Tomorrow, a camel! Clara!

26:31.039 --> 26:32.597
What's happening?

26:32.599 --> 26:35.597
Blue box. Southbank! Definitely
wasn't there five minutes ago.

26:35.599 --> 26:38.879
Are we sure this time?
Earl's Court was an embarrassment.

26:52.079 --> 26:56.277
If you've got a flying time machine,
why are we on a motorbike?

26:56.279 --> 26:58.317
I don't take the TARDIS into battle.

26:58.319 --> 26:59.837
Because it's made of wood?

26:59.839 --> 27:02.117
Because it's the most powerful
ship in the universe

27:02.119 --> 27:05.959
and I don't want it falling into
the wrong hands. OK?

27:19.839 --> 27:23.399
I do love London. So many cameras.

27:27.919 --> 27:31.197
So if we can travel
anywhere in time and space,

27:31.199 --> 27:33.877
why did we travel to the morning?
What's the point in that?

27:33.879 --> 27:37.037
Whoever's after us spent
the whole night looking for us.

27:37.039 --> 27:38.237
Are you tired?

27:38.239 --> 27:39.757
Yes.

27:39.759 --> 27:43.517
Then imagine how they feel.
They came the long way round.

27:43.519 --> 27:46.957
They've got to be close,
definitely London,

27:46.959 --> 27:48.517
going by the signal distribution.

27:48.519 --> 27:51.037
I can hack the lowest level
of their operating system,

27:51.039 --> 27:54.037
but I can't establish a physical
location, the security's too good.

27:54.039 --> 27:56.597
Are you an alien?
I am, yes. OK with that?

27:56.599 --> 27:58.917
Fine, yeah. I think I'm fine.
Oh, good.

27:58.919 --> 28:00.997
So what happens if you do find them?
What then?

28:00.999 --> 28:03.437
I don't know. I can't tell
the future, I just work there.

28:03.439 --> 28:06.277
You don't have a plan? You know what
I always say about plans?

28:06.279 --> 28:09.199
What? I don't have one.
People always have plans.

28:11.279 --> 28:13.237
Yes. Yes, I suppose they do.

28:13.239 --> 28:16.437
So tell me, how long have you been
looking after those kids?

28:16.439 --> 28:18.717
About a year, since their mum died.

28:18.719 --> 28:20.757
OK. But why you?

28:20.759 --> 28:23.357
Family friend, I get that,
but there must have been others.

28:23.359 --> 28:24.557
Why did it have to be you?

28:24.559 --> 28:27.037
I mean, you don't you don't really
seem like a nanny.

28:27.039 --> 28:29.037
Gimme!

28:29.039 --> 28:31.517
Sorry, what?

28:31.519 --> 28:34.597
You need to know where they
physically are. Their exact location.

28:34.599 --> 28:36.077
Yes. I can do it. Oi! I need that!

28:36.079 --> 28:37.997
You've hacked the
lower operating system.

28:37.999 --> 28:40.437
I'll have their physical
location in under five minutes.

28:40.439 --> 28:42.637
Go and get a coffee.
If I can't find them, you can't.

28:42.639 --> 28:45.477
They uploaded me, remember.
I've got computing stuff in my head.

28:45.479 --> 28:47.677
So do I.
I have insane hacking skills.

28:47.679 --> 28:50.677
I'm from space, and the future,
with two hearts and...27 brains.

28:50.679 --> 28:53.717
And I can find them in under five
minutes, plus photographs. 27?

28:53.719 --> 28:55.597
OK, slight exaggeration.

28:55.599 --> 28:58.239
Coffee - go get.
Five minutes, I promise.

29:01.319 --> 29:02.997
The security is absolute.

29:02.999 --> 29:06.639
It's never about the security,
it's about the people.

29:17.639 --> 29:19.757
Why do you keep
looking at me like that?

29:19.759 --> 29:22.957
Sorry, no, it's nothing.
It's just... you're a nanny.

29:22.959 --> 29:24.877
Isn't that a bit... Victorian?

29:24.879 --> 29:26.277
Victorian?

29:26.279 --> 29:29.957
You're young, shouldn't you
be doing, you know, young things?

29:29.959 --> 29:32.317
With-with-with... young people?

29:32.319 --> 29:37.117
What, like you, for instance?
Down, boy! No, no, I didn't...

29:37.119 --> 29:39.159
Shut up!

29:48.639 --> 29:50.917
Ooh!

29:50.919 --> 29:53.437
Two more cappuccinos
over there, please.

29:53.439 --> 29:55.679
One moment, sir.

29:57.199 --> 29:59.197
You realise you haven't
the slightest chance

29:59.199 --> 30:02.037
of saving your little friend?

30:02.039 --> 30:05.997
Sorry, what?
I said one moment, sir.

30:05.999 --> 30:09.237
I said, there is not
the slightest chance you can

30:09.239 --> 30:11.917
save your little friend.

30:11.919 --> 30:15.399
And don't annoy the old man,
he isn't, in fact, speaking.

30:17.239 --> 30:20.197
I'm speaking.
Just using whatever's to hand.

30:20.199 --> 30:24.997
Oh, she's rather pretty, isn't she?
Do you like her?

30:24.999 --> 30:27.199
I can make her like you too,
if you want.

30:28.839 --> 30:30.279
You all right, sir?

30:31.639 --> 30:35.199
Um, yes. Yes, fine.

30:44.879 --> 30:46.277
You OK?

30:46.279 --> 30:48.437
Sure, setting up stuff,
need a user name.

30:48.439 --> 30:49.917
Learning fast.

30:49.919 --> 30:52.957
Clara Oswald for the win! Oswin!

30:52.959 --> 30:55.679
You could always call me Oswin,
seeing as that's my name.

31:01.599 --> 31:03.917
Now I want you to take
a look around.

31:03.919 --> 31:05.717
Go on. Have a little stroll.

31:05.719 --> 31:08.477
And see how impossible
your situation is.

31:08.479 --> 31:12.839
Go on. Take a look,
I do love showing off.

31:22.159 --> 31:26.917
Just let me show you what control
of the Wi-Fi can do for one.

31:26.919 --> 31:28.679
Stop! Stop!

31:36.119 --> 31:38.077
I saw what you can do last night.

31:38.079 --> 31:39.839
And clear!

31:46.399 --> 31:48.117
We can hack anyone in the Wi-Fi,

31:48.119 --> 31:50.117
once they've been exposed
long enough.

31:50.119 --> 31:52.517
So there's one of your walking
base stations somewhere close.

31:52.519 --> 31:54.797
There's always... Someone close.

31:54.799 --> 31:57.637
We've released thousands
into the world.

31:57.639 --> 32:01.439
They home in on the Wi-Fi
like rats sniffing cheese.

32:08.559 --> 32:10.999
There's something
up with the webcams.

32:14.799 --> 32:16.917
I don't know who you
are or why you're doing this

32:16.919 --> 32:18.957
but the people of this
world will not be harmed,

32:18.959 --> 32:20.997
they will not be controlled,
they will not be...

32:20.999 --> 32:24.477
The people of this world are
in no... Danger whatsoever.

32:24.479 --> 32:28.237
My client requires a steady diet
of living human minds.

32:28.239 --> 32:30.637
Healthy, free range human minds.

32:30.639 --> 32:34.677
He loves and cares for humanity.
In fact, he can't get enough of it.

32:34.679 --> 32:36.717
It's obscene. It's murder.

32:36.719 --> 32:37.997
It's life.

32:37.999 --> 32:40.597
The farmer tends
his flock like a loving parent.

32:40.599 --> 32:42.757
The abattoir is not
a contradiction.

32:42.759 --> 32:45.599
No-one loves cattle more
than Burger King.

32:48.879 --> 32:51.717
I'm sure of it, someone's hacking
the webcams. All of them.

32:51.719 --> 32:53.477
Everybody check your webcams!

32:53.479 --> 32:56.559
But what would be the point,
taking mug-shots of us lot?

33:01.559 --> 33:03.559
Who's on Facebook?

33:08.759 --> 33:11.599
Bebo? Myspace? Habbo?

33:14.199 --> 33:17.799
Put your hands down if you didn't
mention where you work.

33:31.159 --> 33:35.077
This ends.
I am going to the end this today!

33:35.079 --> 33:37.197
How? You don't even know...

33:37.199 --> 33:39.077
Where we are.

33:39.079 --> 33:45.119
Who's doing this?
Who is your client? Hmm? Answer me!

33:47.039 --> 33:49.599
Miss Kizlet, we have a problem!

33:54.599 --> 33:58.677
I did it. I really did, I did it.
I found them. You found them.

33:58.679 --> 34:01.637
The Shard. They're in the Shard.
Floor 65. Floor 65.

34:01.639 --> 34:03.637
Are you listening to me,
Doctor? I found them!

34:03.639 --> 34:05.759
I am listening to you.
You found them.

34:29.239 --> 34:32.839
We've got her!
This time, we've really got her!

34:37.918 --> 34:40.677
Clara! Clara!

34:40.679 --> 34:44.438
Doctor? Doctor, help me.
I don't know where I am.

34:46.879 --> 34:51.996
I don't understand. I don't know
where I am! Please help me.

34:51.998 --> 34:53.677
I don't know where I am!

34:53.679 --> 34:57.277
I don't know where I am.
Doctor, please, please, help me.

34:57.279 --> 34:58.999
I don't know where I am.

35:00.439 --> 35:02.757
Doctor, help me.

35:02.759 --> 35:05.917
Help! Help! Please!

35:05.919 --> 35:08.517
Should we pulp her?
Or keep her as a hostage?

35:08.519 --> 35:11.357
There's no point,
she's fully integrated now,

35:11.359 --> 35:14.117
she can't be downloaded again.
I'm sure he knows that.

35:14.119 --> 35:15.679
I'm not sure he does.

35:16.839 --> 35:18.719
He's coming.

35:44.239 --> 35:46.317
We could stop him, I suppose.

35:46.319 --> 35:49.239
Why bother? It might be quite funny.

35:54.959 --> 35:59.077
Really, Doctor, a motorbike?
It hardly seems like you.

35:59.079 --> 36:04.237
I rode this in the Anti-Grav
Olympics, 2074. I came last.

36:04.239 --> 36:07.957
The building is in lock-down.
I'm afraid you're not coming in.

36:07.959 --> 36:10.319
Did you even hear the word
Anti-Grav?

36:18.839 --> 36:23.317
Seriously? He can do that?
He can really, actually do that?

36:23.319 --> 36:25.919
Oh... Dear... Lord.

36:39.639 --> 36:42.117
I think that was your office.

36:42.119 --> 36:45.399
Excuse me,
I believe it's someone to see me.

36:53.559 --> 36:55.917
Do come in.

36:55.919 --> 36:57.317
Download her.

36:57.319 --> 36:59.757
Sorry about the draft.

36:59.759 --> 37:02.717
Download her back into
her body, right now.

37:02.719 --> 37:04.037
I can't.

37:04.039 --> 37:05.117
Yes, you can.

37:05.119 --> 37:09.237
She's a fully integrated
part of the data cloud now.

37:09.239 --> 37:10.677
She can't be separated.

37:10.679 --> 37:13.797
Then download the entire cloud.
Everyone you've trapped in there.

37:13.799 --> 37:15.157
You realise what would happen?

37:15.159 --> 37:18.557
Yes, those still with bodies
to go home to would be free.

37:18.559 --> 37:21.797
A tiny number.
Most would simply die.

37:21.799 --> 37:24.357
They'd be released
from a living hell.

37:24.359 --> 37:28.157
It's the best you can do for them,
so give the order.

37:28.159 --> 37:29.717
And why would I do that?

37:29.719 --> 37:32.517
Because I'm going to motivate you.

37:32.519 --> 37:34.119
Any second now.

37:36.479 --> 37:40.637
You ridiculous man! Why did you even
come here? Whatever for?

37:40.639 --> 37:41.917
I didn't. What?

37:41.919 --> 37:43.677
I'm still in the cafe.

37:43.679 --> 37:47.117
I'm finishing my coffee.
Lovely spot.

37:47.119 --> 37:48.597
What are you talking about?

37:48.599 --> 37:50.797
You hack people. Me?

37:50.799 --> 37:52.239
I'm old-fashioned.

37:54.479 --> 37:56.477
I hack technology.

37:56.479 --> 37:58.479
Here's your motivation!

38:04.519 --> 38:08.037
No. No. No!

38:08.039 --> 38:11.039
Not me! Not me!

38:16.239 --> 38:22.917
Put me back! Put me back!
Download me at once!

38:22.919 --> 38:26.319
That is an order!
That is an order!

38:28.359 --> 38:32.477
But she's fully integrated now. We'd
have to download the entire cloud.

38:32.479 --> 38:34.077
We can't do that.

38:34.079 --> 38:35.917
No. We can't.

38:35.919 --> 38:38.759
Download me!

38:56.999 --> 38:59.159
Download me!

39:00.719 --> 39:02.639
Do what she says!

39:32.199 --> 39:33.879
Doctor?

39:42.439 --> 39:43.879
Doctor!

39:46.439 --> 39:47.597
Doctor!

39:47.599 --> 39:49.397
You have no right
to be in this office,

39:49.399 --> 39:51.477
and I am demanding
that you leave at once!

39:51.479 --> 39:53.597
This building is
under UNIT's control.

39:53.599 --> 39:55.477
What is UNIT?
I've never heard of you!

39:55.479 --> 39:57.119
I suggest you calm down, sir.

39:58.999 --> 40:02.117
UNIT are here,
friends of the Doctor, I presume.

40:02.119 --> 40:04.917
Oh, old friends, very old friends.

40:04.919 --> 40:08.237
Then I appear to have failed you,
Great Intelligence.

40:08.239 --> 40:11.557
I have feasted on many minds,
I have grown.

40:11.559 --> 40:14.877
But now, it is time
for you to reduce.

40:14.879 --> 40:18.157
You've been whispering in my ear
so long,

40:18.159 --> 40:21.397
I'm not sure I remember
what I was before.

40:21.399 --> 40:23.439
Goodbye, Miss Kizlet.

40:48.719 --> 40:54.477
Sorry, where am I?
What am I doing here?

40:54.479 --> 40:58.757
Are you soldiers? What's happening?
How did I get here?

40:58.759 --> 41:01.797
Excuse me, where are the toilets?
The toilets?

41:01.799 --> 41:04.239
I'm here to fix the toilets,
the gents.

41:05.879 --> 41:07.319
How long have I been here?

41:08.959 --> 41:13.039
Stay where you are!
Ma'am, identify yourself!

41:16.679 --> 41:19.279
Where are my mummy and daddy?

41:20.599 --> 41:22.639
They said they wouldn't be long.

41:25.079 --> 41:26.879
Are they coming back?

41:44.759 --> 41:46.399
Come in.

41:50.559 --> 41:53.597
So. He comes back, does he?

41:53.599 --> 41:55.997
You didn't answer my question.

41:55.999 --> 41:57.599
What question?

42:00.479 --> 42:02.319
You don't seem like a nanny.

42:05.399 --> 42:07.397
I was going to travel.

42:07.399 --> 42:09.757
I came to stay for a week
before I left

42:09.759 --> 42:11.679
and during that week...

42:14.279 --> 42:18.199
She died,
so you're returning the favour.

42:20.479 --> 42:22.877
You've got 101 places to see,

42:22.879 --> 42:25.477
and you haven't been
to any of them, have you?

42:25.479 --> 42:27.317
That's why you keep the book.

42:27.319 --> 42:31.119
I keep the book cos I'm still going.

42:33.399 --> 42:36.717
But you don't run out on
the people you care about.

42:36.719 --> 42:38.439
Wish I was more like that.

42:40.719 --> 42:44.477
You know,
the thing about a time machine,

42:44.479 --> 42:48.597
you can run away all you like
and still be home in time for tea,

42:48.599 --> 42:50.399
so what do you say?

42:51.719 --> 42:55.759
Anywhere. All of time and space,
right outside those doors.

42:58.399 --> 43:01.117
Does this work? Eh?

43:01.119 --> 43:02.917
Is this actually what you do?

43:02.919 --> 43:04.517
Do you just crook your finger

43:04.519 --> 43:07.157
and people just jump in
your snog box and fly away?

43:07.159 --> 43:09.517
It is not a snog box!
I'll be the judge of that!

43:09.519 --> 43:11.239
Starting when?

43:17.559 --> 43:21.037
Come back tomorrow, ask me again.

43:21.039 --> 43:22.557
Why?

43:22.559 --> 43:24.797
Cos tomorrow, I might say yes.

43:24.799 --> 43:27.677
Some time after 7.00 OK for you?

43:27.679 --> 43:31.037
It's a time machine, any time's OK.

43:31.039 --> 43:32.397
See you then.

43:32.399 --> 43:33.757
Clara?

43:33.759 --> 43:37.799
Uh-huh?
In your book there was a leaf, why?

43:39.199 --> 43:43.599
That wasn't a leaf,
that was page one.

43:52.159 --> 43:57.079
Right then, Clara Oswald.
Time to find out who you are.

44:11.479 --> 44:13.597
What do you want to see?
Something awesome.

44:13.599 --> 44:15.197
Akhaten. Can we see it, up close?

44:15.199 --> 44:16.877
Oh! Are you OK?

44:16.879 --> 44:18.477
Have you seen her? Who?

44:18.479 --> 44:19.717
I'm Merry Gehlal.

44:19.719 --> 44:21.037
The Queen of Years.

44:21.039 --> 44:22.637
I'm the vessel of our history.

44:22.639 --> 44:25.637
What's happening,
is that supposed to happen? Doctor!

44:25.639 --> 44:27.837
We don't walk away.

44:27.839 --> 44:29.559
Merry!

44:32.039 --> 44:34.317
I'm armed... with a screwdriver!

44:34.319 --> 44:35.879
Grandfather's away.

44:37.639 --> 44:39.759
You have it all!
