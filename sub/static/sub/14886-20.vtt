If you're hungry,
there's some din‐din machmud

01:57.818 --> 01:58.719
on the bottom shelf.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.421
What's "Din‐din machmud?"

02:02.355 --> 02:04.224
Pig snout with saffron.

02:05.692 --> 02:06.860
No, thank you.

02:06.893 --> 02:08.529
I'm on a low‐saffron diet.

02:11.932 --> 02:12.899
Mm.

02:15.435 --> 02:17.303
What's this?

02:17.337 --> 02:19.506
I'm doing a Myposian
lint painting.

02:20.807 --> 02:23.944
‐ 'A lint painting?'
‐ Well, exactly.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.613
On Mypos,
we waste nothing.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.381
Interesting story.
The first one..

02:30.483 --> 02:32.285
The first one
was done by Brektos

02:32.318 --> 02:35.556
our spiritual leader,
in the storybook days.

02:35.589 --> 02:38.759
And the legend says that
he went up on the mountain

02:38.792 --> 02:42.362
for a 60 day
and 60 night

02:42.395 --> 02:44.898
to contemplate his navel.

02:44.931 --> 02:47.868
And when he came down..

02:47.901 --> 02:49.302
...he had a lint painting.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.509
We've been doing it
ever since.

02:55.542 --> 02:56.409
How do you like it?

02:58.912 --> 03:01.414
Uh, well, uh,
what can I say?

03:03.850 --> 03:05.686
You could hang this

03:05.719 --> 03:07.754
under any rug
in the world.

03:07.788 --> 03:10.991
Oh, cousin, oh..

03:11.024 --> 03:14.327
‐ You don't mean that.
‐ Oh, I do.

03:14.360 --> 03:15.829
Thank you.

03:15.862 --> 03:18.532
You know, it's because of you
I got back into lint painting.

03:18.565 --> 03:21.334
Because I see you take all these
pictures for the photo contest

03:21.367 --> 03:24.671
and it makes me want to
do something creative too.

03:24.705 --> 03:27.473
Well, I'm glad one of us
benefited from all my hard work.

03:28.875 --> 03:29.976
What the matter?

03:30.010 --> 03:33.514
Can't you pick which picture
to put in the photo contest?

03:33.547 --> 03:34.715
Yes.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.382
None of 'em.

03:36.416 --> 03:37.984
What?

03:38.018 --> 03:39.720
You're not going to enter
the photo contest?

03:39.753 --> 03:41.522
Uh, who am I kidding?

03:41.555 --> 03:42.923
The Chicago Gazette
photo contest

03:42.956 --> 03:44.591
is one of the most
prestigious there is.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.927
It was just a crazy dream.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.495
I thought if I won
my photo‐journalism career

03:49.530 --> 03:51.297
would have been launched.

03:51.331 --> 03:53.499
Well, it would be nice
if you were launched.

03:56.369 --> 03:57.403
It would have been wonderful.

03:57.437 --> 03:58.972
But, cousin,
I don't understand.

03:59.005 --> 04:01.441
You've been taking pictures
for three months.

04:01.474 --> 04:03.309
You must have
a hundred here.

04:03.343 --> 04:05.411
A hundred and six.

04:05.445 --> 04:06.780
And they all stink.

04:06.813 --> 04:08.982
No, they don't.

04:09.015 --> 04:10.584
They are very,
very good.

04:10.617 --> 04:14.054
Balki, very, very good
will not win this contest.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.656
I need that
one special picture.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.423
I need something

04:18.458 --> 04:20.426
extraordinary.

04:20.459 --> 04:22.663
Something that will
make the heart of man

04:22.696 --> 04:24.831
leap within him.

04:24.865 --> 04:28.535
Something that sums up
the meaning of life.

04:29.536 --> 04:30.604
You know what I mean?

04:30.637 --> 04:32.739
Well, of course I do.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.508
Don't be ridiculous.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.477
You need something..

04:38.979 --> 04:40.046
...a little different.

04:45.986 --> 04:46.787
Yes, that's right.

04:49.523 --> 04:51.692
Well, what about this one
of the, of the kitty cat

04:51.725 --> 04:53.326
being carried away
by the big bird?

04:53.359 --> 04:54.795
That's different.

04:54.828 --> 04:57.397
Balki, look at
the kitty cat's face.

04:57.430 --> 04:58.765
What do you see?

05:01.067 --> 05:02.335
Fear.

05:05.706 --> 05:07.908
Sure.
Sure, you see fear.

05:07.941 --> 05:11.077
But the keen eye of the
photographer sees a kitty cat

05:11.111 --> 05:14.447
with three whiskers on
the left side of his face

05:14.480 --> 05:15.616
and two on the right.

05:15.649 --> 05:16.883
There's no symmetry.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.125
Okay.

05:25.158 --> 05:28.895
What about this one of
the fireman catching the baby

05:28.929 --> 05:30.764
that was thrown from
the burning building?

05:31.565 --> 05:32.666
It's been done.

05:34.134 --> 05:35.936
Why am I even talking
to you about this?

05:35.969 --> 05:37.971
You probably don't even
have photographers on Mypos.

05:38.004 --> 05:39.906
Well, no, we don't.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.808
But we have a guy
named Nicholai

05:41.842 --> 05:43.810
who has a very
good memory.

05:46.747 --> 05:47.914
Whenever we have a fire

05:47.948 --> 05:49.850
Nicky's the first
thing we save.

05:53.587 --> 05:55.388
Well, good.

05:55.421 --> 05:57.791
Why don't we enter
Nicky in the contest?

05:57.824 --> 05:58.859
He's got a better
chance than me.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.761
Oh, cousin.

06:00.794 --> 06:03.396
I see what you're doing.

06:03.429 --> 06:04.898
You had a crazy dream

06:04.931 --> 06:06.800
and you spent three months
taking pictures.

06:06.833 --> 06:08.434
And now with only
one day left

06:08.468 --> 06:10.537
you're just going
to roll over and die?

06:12.438 --> 06:13.807
That's basically
what I had in mind, yes.

06:15.842 --> 06:17.644
Well, let me tell
you a story

06:17.678 --> 06:19.079
about an immigrant boy

06:19.112 --> 06:21.682
who had a crazy dream
to come to America.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.584
‐ Wait..
‐ He got on the tramp steamer.

06:23.617 --> 06:25.519
‐ Wait..
‐ Tramp, tramp, tramp.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.153
Wait, I've heard
this story.

06:27.187 --> 06:29.422
It's not gonna
do you any good.

06:29.455 --> 06:31.091
I'm feeling sorry
for myself.

06:31.124 --> 06:33.760
If you were a real friend,
you'd join in.

06:38.064 --> 06:40.901
Well, I do feel
sorry for you.

06:40.934 --> 06:43.704
Poor little,
Larry Appleton.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.606
He could have been
a great photographer

06:45.639 --> 06:48.474
but he'll never know

06:48.509 --> 06:52.546
because he gave up.

06:52.579 --> 06:54.147
Oh, I hate it
when you do this.

06:56.683 --> 06:58.018
In the years to come

06:58.051 --> 07:00.453
you'll look back on
what you might have been

07:00.486 --> 07:03.156
and you'll remember that
your best buddy, Balki, said

07:03.189 --> 07:05.091
"Keep trying,
Larry Appleton."

07:05.125 --> 07:07.160
But you didn't.

07:09.730 --> 07:12.566
Can't you just let
me accept failure?

07:12.599 --> 07:14.200
Over my dead battery.

07:17.203 --> 07:20.040
Alright, alright, I don't
know what I'm gonna find

07:20.073 --> 07:22.709
in just one day,
but I'll give it a shot.

07:22.743 --> 07:24.711
Now you're
talking, turkey.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.983
Now we are so happy,
we do the dance of joy.

07:30.016 --> 07:31.618
Balki, Balki.

07:31.652 --> 07:32.886
Why don't we hold up
on that?

07:32.919 --> 07:35.656
At least let me
find a picture.

07:35.689 --> 07:39.660
Cousin, somewhere out there
is the perfect picture.

07:39.693 --> 07:40.961
I know it.

07:40.994 --> 07:43.263
And you're going
to find it.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.865
Yeah, yeah.

07:44.898 --> 07:46.733
And pigs can fly.

07:46.767 --> 07:48.502
That would make
a great picture.

07:56.142 --> 07:58.211
The man just needed
a little push.

08:07.688 --> 08:08.789
Thank you.

08:12.258 --> 08:14.628
Larry, guess what?
I got your mail again.

08:14.661 --> 08:15.896
It's an easy mistake.

08:15.929 --> 08:18.264
I'm in 302,
you're in 203.

08:18.298 --> 08:20.100
Perhaps the mailman
has lysdexia.

08:22.736 --> 08:23.937
That's dyslexia.

08:25.606 --> 08:27.173
Is that it?

08:27.207 --> 08:30.110
I always get that
word turned around.

08:30.143 --> 08:32.212
So, did you send a picture
for the photo contest yet?

08:32.245 --> 08:33.880
No, but I'm going to.

08:33.914 --> 08:35.782
I was gonna give up,
but Balki wouldn't let me.

08:35.816 --> 08:37.884
Sure enough,
I found the perfect shot.

08:37.918 --> 08:39.052
I'm gonna take
it this afternoon.

08:39.085 --> 08:40.153
What is it?

08:40.186 --> 08:41.287
Well, It's a little church

08:41.321 --> 08:42.322
with a cross
on the steeple

08:42.355 --> 08:43.823
but that's not
the shot.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.158
I am so proud
of myself.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.793
There's not a photographer
in a million

08:46.827 --> 08:48.629
who would have even
seen the shot.

08:48.662 --> 08:50.096
At exactly 6:02

08:50.130 --> 08:52.633
the setting sun drops between
these two tall buildings

08:52.666 --> 08:54.868
and a shaft of light
hits the cross

08:54.901 --> 08:56.903
turning it this‐this
brilliant gold.

08:56.937 --> 08:59.105
And it glows like
something supernatural.

08:59.139 --> 09:01.742
It only lasts for a second
and then it's gone.

09:01.775 --> 09:04.277
‐ It's beautiful.
‐ Yeah, churches are nice.

09:04.310 --> 09:05.211
See ya.

09:08.982 --> 09:10.851
‐ Hi.
‐ Hi.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.886
Cousin, I'm,
I'm sorry I'm late

09:12.919 --> 09:15.088
but wait until
you hear why.

09:15.121 --> 09:18.158
Mrs. Twinkacetti asked me to
move some furniture in her house

09:18.191 --> 09:21.127
and behind the dresser, I found
a gold mine in dust balls.

09:23.329 --> 09:24.865
‐ Forget the dust.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.232
You were right,
I did it.

09:26.266 --> 09:28.034
I found the award‐winning
photograph.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.336
Oh, cousin,
I'm so happy for you.

09:30.370 --> 09:32.305
It's a little church with
a cross on the steeple

09:32.338 --> 09:33.840
but that's not the shot.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.241
I am so proud of myself.

09:35.275 --> 09:36.843
There is not a photographer
in a million

09:36.877 --> 09:38.745
who would have
even seen the shot.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.113
Wait a minute.

09:40.146 --> 09:42.282
This isn't the little church
where the setting sun falls

09:42.315 --> 09:45.051
between two tall buildings
and casts a shaft of light

09:45.085 --> 09:47.888
on the cross that makes
it glow a brilliant gold

09:47.921 --> 09:50.090
as if it has taken on a life
all of its own, is it?

09:55.796 --> 09:58.131
Well, it's the angle
that's important.

09:58.164 --> 09:59.733
What I'm gonna
have to do is‐‐

09:59.766 --> 10:01.635
Get on the roof of the building
across the street.

10:03.670 --> 10:06.206
‐ The address is 2‐‐
‐ 2831 Garfield.

10:06.239 --> 10:08.041
‐ Can I tell this?
‐ Oh, well, I wish you would.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.845
I have to get the shot
this afternoon

10:11.878 --> 10:13.379
otherwise, the jig is up.

10:13.413 --> 10:15.716
I'm gonna have to get
the owner's permission

10:15.749 --> 10:17.017
and you're gonna have to help
me get all that equipment

10:17.050 --> 10:18.351
up on top of the roof.

10:18.384 --> 10:21.788
Balki, I have this
contest in the bag.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.189
I'm on my way
to the good life.

10:25.391 --> 10:27.928
What means
"The good life?"

10:27.961 --> 10:30.263
It means the, uh..

10:30.296 --> 10:32.666
...good...life.

10:35.001 --> 10:36.369
Wow.

10:37.437 --> 10:39.105
I am so happy for you.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.141
Now, we can do
the dance of joy.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.375
You bet.

Fred and Ginger,
front and center.

10:51.818 --> 10:54.020
I'm taking rest of the day off
to be with my lovely wife

10:54.054 --> 10:57.991
my lovely children at my less
than lovely mother‐in‐law's.

10:58.024 --> 10:59.359
Appleton, this is what
I want you to do.

10:59.392 --> 11:01.327
I'll get there around four.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.997
Call my wife and tell
her the store is on fire.

11:04.030 --> 11:05.331
That way I gotta come back

11:05.365 --> 11:07.768
and spend the rest of
the weekend playing poker.

11:07.801 --> 11:11.705
‐ See ya.
‐ Uh, Mr. Twinkacetti.

11:11.738 --> 11:14.775
I can't tell your wife
there's a fire in the store.

11:14.808 --> 11:16.810
Right, I've used
that excuse before.

11:16.843 --> 11:20.213
Tell her the turnip
locked himself in the safe.

11:20.246 --> 11:22.282
Who wouldn't believe that?

11:22.315 --> 11:23.817
‐ I can't tell her that either.
‐ What is it?

11:23.850 --> 11:25.719
Make something
up, Appleton!

11:25.752 --> 11:27.721
‐ Listen, cousin‐‐
‐ Not now, Balki.

11:27.754 --> 11:29.122
Mr. Twinkacetti

11:29.155 --> 11:31.725
I will not lie
to your wife for you.

11:31.758 --> 11:34.260
Appleton, someday, you will
want something from me

11:34.294 --> 11:36.296
and no matter how small
that something is

11:36.329 --> 11:38.799
my response will
be a well‐known gesture.

11:43.269 --> 11:45.305
You know that building
you want to get on the top of

11:45.338 --> 11:46.406
so you can take
the picture of the church?

11:46.439 --> 11:47.508
‐ Yes.
‐ The one‐‐

11:47.541 --> 11:49.943
Yes, I know it.
I know the building.

11:49.976 --> 11:51.077
I know it well, yes.
What about it?

11:51.111 --> 11:52.445
It's Mr. Twinkacetti's house.

11:52.478 --> 11:54.147
[sobbing]

11:54.180 --> 11:56.116
‐ Oh, don't cry.
‐ Alright.

11:58.519 --> 11:59.520
That was easy.

11:59.553 --> 12:02.222
You know, you're bouncing back
better all the time.

12:02.255 --> 12:03.924
Balki

12:03.957 --> 12:05.526
you and I are gonna
get on that roof

12:05.559 --> 12:07.528
and we are going to
get that picture

12:07.561 --> 12:09.262
even if it kills us.

12:31.885 --> 12:33.820
[grunting]

12:35.889 --> 12:37.157
(Balki)
'Cousin, can‐can
you give me a hand?'

12:45.966 --> 12:47.901
I‐I don't like this.

12:47.934 --> 12:50.403
We're not supposed to
break into somebody's house.

12:50.436 --> 12:52.238
We're not breaking
into Twinky's house

12:52.272 --> 12:54.240
we're breaking onto
his house.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.242
Besides, he's not even home.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.944
Just try to act
like you belong here.

12:59.345 --> 13:01.181
How do I act like
I belong on a roof?

13:01.214 --> 13:03.483
Will you stop worrying?

13:04.951 --> 13:07.353
We'll be off of here
in five minutes.

13:08.922 --> 13:12.025
‐ It's pretty far down.
‐ Only two stories.

13:12.058 --> 13:14.494
‐ The roof is pretty steep.
‐ I hadn't noticed.

13:14.528 --> 13:17.030
Balki, get that
for me, would you?

13:17.063 --> 13:19.199
I don't think so.

13:19.232 --> 13:20.967
Cousin, I don't understand.

13:21.001 --> 13:23.169
You're the one that's
afraid of heights.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.438
You scream if you
stand up in the bathtub.

13:25.471 --> 13:27.874
Balki, I have to get
this picture.

13:27.908 --> 13:30.076
My whole future
depends on it.

13:30.110 --> 13:31.578
Nothing's gonna stop me.

13:31.612 --> 13:34.515
There are no obstacles and
absolutely nothing can go wrong.

13:34.548 --> 13:37.350
I know that nothing
can possibly go wrong

13:37.383 --> 13:40.020
but have you noticed that
it's getting a little windy?

13:41.121 --> 13:42.856
It's a little breezy.

13:42.889 --> 13:45.091
Fortunately, I have
everything in my camera bag

13:45.125 --> 13:47.961
that you could possibly need
in a photographic emergency.

13:47.994 --> 13:50.230
Here, hold this.

13:50.263 --> 13:53.166
[grunting]

13:53.199 --> 13:55.268
Sandbags.

13:55.301 --> 13:58.204
We can't have the tripod blowing
off in the wind now can we?

13:58.238 --> 13:59.906
Well, of course we can't.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.407
Don't be ridiculous.

14:01.441 --> 14:03.644
What about me
blowing off the roof?

14:03.677 --> 14:05.311
You're not in
a photographic emergency.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.379
I'm human!

14:06.412 --> 14:09.449
That's not good enough.
Just hang on.

14:09.482 --> 14:12.185
We'll be off here
in two minutes.

14:12.218 --> 14:13.920
Okay, give me the camera.

14:18.258 --> 14:19.960
Balki, give me the camera.

14:20.694 --> 14:22.362
No.

14:22.395 --> 14:24.164
I have the camera

14:24.197 --> 14:26.066
and I say we get off the roof.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.368
Balki..

14:28.401 --> 14:30.336
...give me that camera.

14:31.404 --> 14:32.873
Uh‐uh.

14:39.646 --> 14:41.615
Oh, look, there's
the Wicked Witch of the West.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.950
Where?

14:43.984 --> 14:45.686
Ha‐ha!

14:45.719 --> 14:47.320
You tricked Balki.

14:47.353 --> 14:49.623
‐ There was no witch.
‐ Ha!

14:49.656 --> 14:52.258
No way am I getting off
this roof now.

14:52.292 --> 14:55.428
No, I've taken this shot
a thousand times in my head.

14:55.461 --> 14:58.064
I've planned every
minute detail.

14:59.533 --> 15:01.602
Where'd that chimney
come from?

15:01.635 --> 15:03.369
I bet it came
with the house.

15:04.437 --> 15:06.573
What idiot architect
would put a chimney

15:06.607 --> 15:08.975
where it blocks the view
of the beautiful church?

15:09.009 --> 15:10.476
Where have all the good
craftsmen gone?

15:10.511 --> 15:11.712
Maybe, they got blown
off the roof.

15:11.745 --> 15:13.980
Cousin, you've flipped
your coin.

15:14.014 --> 15:15.682
You have plenty of
good pictures at home.

15:19.485 --> 15:21.154
If I can get on top
of the chimney

15:21.187 --> 15:22.355
I can still get my shot.

15:23.323 --> 15:24.357
No, cousin, cousin.

15:27.327 --> 15:28.995
Cousin.
Cousin, will you..

15:29.029 --> 15:30.496
Whoa! Whoa.

15:35.001 --> 15:36.069
[telephone ringing]

15:36.102 --> 15:37.538
Yeah, hi, Ralph.

15:37.571 --> 15:40.440
Yeah, I can make it to
the card game after all.

15:40.473 --> 15:43.076
I told my wife the turnip
got locked in the safe

15:43.109 --> 15:44.310
and she bought it.

15:44.344 --> 15:46.112
Who wouldn't?
See you at eight.

15:51.117 --> 15:53.386
Balki, help,
I'm in trouble here.

15:55.055 --> 15:57.591
‐ 'Help!'
‐ Hush.

15:57.624 --> 16:00.193
Never hush a man who's
hanging by his fingertips.

16:00.226 --> 16:02.362
Help! Help!

16:02.395 --> 16:05.498
‐ Mr. Twinkacetti's home.
‐ Help, help.

16:10.671 --> 16:12.272
Cousin, we have to get
off the roof

16:12.305 --> 16:13.640
before Mr. Twinkacetti
catches us.

16:13.674 --> 16:14.575
Later.

16:14.608 --> 16:18.044
I still have 50 seconds
to get this picture.

16:18.078 --> 16:20.614
If I hold on to
this TV antenna

16:20.647 --> 16:22.549
I can hold the camera
in one hand

16:22.583 --> 16:25.318
and lean out past
the chimney.

16:25.351 --> 16:26.787
But, you know that picture
of the kitty cat

16:26.820 --> 16:28.188
is looking better
all the time.

16:28.221 --> 16:29.656
I can see it.

16:29.690 --> 16:32.125
You know, I'm getting
an optical illusion.

16:32.158 --> 16:35.562
It looks as if the church
is getting closer and closer.

16:37.263 --> 16:39.432
Cousin.
Cousin, the antenna is bending.

16:39.465 --> 16:40.701
‐ Come back here.
‐ No, no.

16:40.734 --> 16:42.268
It'll hold for
five more seconds.

16:42.302 --> 16:44.070
I've got to get this shot.

16:44.104 --> 16:46.206
Three, two

16:46.239 --> 16:48.174
one, zero.

16:49.375 --> 16:52.345
Minus one, minus two, mi..

16:52.378 --> 16:54.180
Where is the shaft of light?

16:54.214 --> 16:55.448
Where is the sun?

16:58.184 --> 17:00.621
Maybe, it's behind those
big black clouds over there.

17:00.654 --> 17:03.389
Cousin, don't panic.
Just slowly come back here.

17:03.423 --> 17:05.692
Oh, the weather report said
it was supposed to be sunny.

17:05.726 --> 17:07.393
Now the picture is gone.
What am I gonna do?

17:07.426 --> 17:10.396
Cousin, just to get
an idea of where you are

17:10.430 --> 17:11.632
you might look down.

17:17.604 --> 17:19.573
[screaming]

17:23.676 --> 17:25.546
At least now we're talking
on the same channel.

17:25.579 --> 17:27.480
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

17:27.513 --> 17:28.749
Alright, you didn't
get your picture

17:28.782 --> 17:29.750
now we get off the roof.

17:31.151 --> 17:32.653
I can't.

17:32.686 --> 17:34.154
I just remembered

17:34.187 --> 17:35.722
I'm afraid of heights.

17:35.756 --> 17:38.659
Well, you picked a fine time
to‐to remember that.

17:38.692 --> 17:41.394
Okay, okay, okay.

17:41.427 --> 17:43.630
Okay, we're going to wait
until it gets dark

17:43.664 --> 17:45.566
and then you won't
see how far down it is.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.102
Did I mention
I'm afraid of the dark?

17:59.279 --> 18:01.882
Cousin. Cousin,
do‐don't do that.

18:01.915 --> 18:04.484
Cousin, uh, it's dark now.
We can get off the roof.

18:07.721 --> 18:09.389
I can't believe it.

18:09.422 --> 18:10.857
I didn't get my picture.

18:10.891 --> 18:13.293
This is all
Twinkacetti's fault.

18:13.326 --> 18:15.596
Boy, the next time
I see him, he's in trouble.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.136
What are you two
doing up on my roof?

18:24.771 --> 18:27.340
Mr. Twinkacetti,
this is all my fault.

18:27.373 --> 18:29.876
That goes without saying.

18:29.910 --> 18:31.444
I was trying to get
a picture of the church

18:31.477 --> 18:32.746
for my photo contest.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.480
But he didn't
get the picture.

18:34.515 --> 18:36.249
‐ Cry me a river!
‐ Okay.

18:36.282 --> 18:37.818
[sobbing]

18:37.851 --> 18:40.521
‐ Now get off my roof.
‐ Okay

18:45.726 --> 18:46.527
[both]
The ladder!

18:48.895 --> 18:51.164
Now I'm stuck up here
and it's your fault!

18:51.197 --> 18:52.365
My fault?

18:52.398 --> 18:53.667
You wouldn't be up here

18:53.700 --> 18:54.668
if you were with
your wife and kids

18:54.701 --> 18:55.769
like you were
supposed to be.

18:55.802 --> 18:58.238
I wouldn't have come up here
if you weren't playing

18:58.271 --> 19:00.273
Tarzan on my antenna.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.275
I wouldn't have had to
if you'd put your chimney

19:02.308 --> 19:04.645
on the right side of
your house where it belongs.

19:04.678 --> 19:07.480
I'm gonna put my fist
where it belongs.

19:07.514 --> 19:09.550
No, wait,
Mr. Twinkacetti.

19:09.583 --> 19:11.752
Stop, stop, stop.

19:11.785 --> 19:14.354
Will you stop?
Whoa!

19:14.387 --> 19:16.690
‐ Whoa.
‐ 'Let go. Let go.'

19:18.592 --> 19:21.528
[grunting]

19:24.264 --> 19:26.800
[all panting]

19:30.671 --> 19:31.938
We've got to stop fighting

19:31.972 --> 19:34.908
and find a way
to get off the roof.

19:34.941 --> 19:37.678
What did you
have in mind?

19:37.711 --> 19:40.413
Help!

19:40.446 --> 19:41.982
Save your voice.

19:42.015 --> 19:44.284
No one can hear you because
their windows are closed.

19:44.317 --> 19:46.787
And do you know why their
windows are closed?

19:46.820 --> 19:48.254
Because it's starting
to freeze?

19:48.288 --> 19:50.691
‐ Bingo!
‐ I'm sorry I got that right.

19:52.258 --> 19:54.595
What else could
possibly go wrong?

19:56.429 --> 19:57.598
[thunder rumbling]

20:01.835 --> 20:04.571
[raining]

20:10.911 --> 20:12.646
It was a rhetorical question.

20:14.515 --> 20:18.852
You know, this‐this might be
a good chance for us to just

20:18.885 --> 20:20.721
chat and get to
know one another.

20:23.489 --> 20:25.892
I'm gonna throw the
turnip off the roof.

20:25.926 --> 20:28.895
And if we're lucky,
he'll drag himself to get help.

20:28.929 --> 20:32.032
If we're unlucky,
we're still lucky.

20:32.065 --> 20:33.266
Yeah.

20:35.301 --> 20:36.537
‐ What was that?
‐ Thunder.

20:36.570 --> 20:39.039
Ah, I hate thunder.

20:39.072 --> 20:42.643
You know, there's
something aesthetically

20:42.676 --> 20:44.377
pleasing about your face

20:44.410 --> 20:45.579
when you're terrified.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.683
I want my wife.
Edwina! Edwina!

20:52.519 --> 20:55.421
That's great. I think I got
your face framed by lightning.

20:55.455 --> 20:58.358
‐ Ooh, you're cruel, Appleton.
‐ No, I'm not.

20:58.391 --> 21:01.895
Oh, oh, hold that whimper.
Yes.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.597
[whimpering]

21:06.032 --> 21:08.401
Aah!

21:08.434 --> 21:10.804
‐ What's that?
‐ I don't know.

21:10.837 --> 21:13.507
‐ Is this another TV antenna?
‐ It's a lightning rod!

21:13.540 --> 21:16.677
[screaming]

21:16.710 --> 21:18.712
That‐that draws lightning?

21:18.745 --> 21:21.481
It's a real
good one, too.

21:21.515 --> 21:23.416
If we stay up here,
we'll die.

21:27.821 --> 21:31.057
[together]
Help! Help!

21:32.593 --> 21:34.027
‐ Help!
‐ Help!

21:39.666 --> 21:41.668
[instrumental music]

21:46.840 --> 21:49.710
"Larry Appleton,
10th place."

21:49.743 --> 21:52.012
Yeah, I'm good, alright.

21:52.045 --> 21:54.380
I even helped somebody
else win first prize.

21:54.414 --> 21:56.482
But I think it was
very nice of someone

21:56.517 --> 21:57.851
to take that picture
of the fireman

21:57.884 --> 21:59.452
rescuing us from the roof.

22:01.487 --> 22:03.924
It's a terrific picture,
if you call that composition.

22:05.559 --> 22:07.661
Cousin, you won 10th place.

22:07.694 --> 22:09.830
That's wonderful.

22:09.863 --> 22:12.599
Well, thank you for
making me keep trying.

22:12.633 --> 22:14.500
And for helping me
get the picture.

22:14.535 --> 22:15.936
And for saving your life.

22:17.437 --> 22:18.905
That too.

22:18.939 --> 22:20.874
Cousin, I couldn't
let you quit.

22:22.108 --> 22:24.645
Or die.

22:24.678 --> 22:27.480
And if you see me giving up,
you must stop me too.

22:27.514 --> 22:29.716
That's what friends
do for each other.

22:29.750 --> 22:31.785
Yeah.

22:31.818 --> 22:33.854
Why don't we go down
to Curly's newsstand

22:33.887 --> 22:37.090
and buy every newspaper he has
to send to everyone you know?

22:37.123 --> 22:39.626
Just like the time Mary Ann
got her picture in the paper

22:39.660 --> 22:41.895
because she got her head stuck
in a chain‐link fence.

22:43.564 --> 22:45.566
That was her hair.

22:45.599 --> 22:47.768
Balki, I don't need
to buy newspapers

22:47.801 --> 22:49.536
because I‐I don't
need to brag.

22:51.805 --> 22:53.106
But this is
a great accomplishment.

22:53.139 --> 22:54.074
You should be proud.

22:54.107 --> 22:57.110
Ah, I don't need to send
a newspaper to anyone.

22:57.143 --> 22:59.680
The important
thing is that I know.

23:00.714 --> 23:02.549
Wow.

23:03.684 --> 23:04.818
You're some humble guy.

23:07.854 --> 23:09.189
Balki

23:09.222 --> 23:11.124
A lot of it
was blind luck.

23:11.157 --> 23:13.459
I didn't get the
picture I was after.

23:13.493 --> 23:16.429
Yes, but if you hadn't risked
your life and mine

23:16.462 --> 23:18.031
trying to get the picture
of the church

23:18.064 --> 23:20.834
you never would have gotten
this picture of Mr. Twinkacetti

23:20.867 --> 23:22.536
framed by lightning.

23:24.605 --> 23:25.872
It is pretty good, isn't it?

23:25.906 --> 23:28.675
‐ Good? Good?
‐ Yeah.

23:28.709 --> 23:30.911
‐ Good?
‐ Ha‐ha‐ha.

23:30.944 --> 23:32.078
What was the question?

23:34.047 --> 23:36.116
The picture.
It's‐it's pretty good.

23:36.149 --> 23:39.886
Well, of course it is.
Don't be ridiculous.

23:41.588 --> 23:42.989
And I'll tell you what.

23:43.023 --> 23:45.058
To celebrate
I'm gonna take you

23:45.091 --> 23:47.127
to your favorite place.

23:47.160 --> 23:49.896
‐ Not the petting zoo?
‐ You got it.

23:49.930 --> 23:52.065
Oh, boy!

23:52.098 --> 23:55.035
Are you going to ride
the camel with me this time?

23:55.068 --> 23:57.604
No.
The camel always spits at me.

23:59.906 --> 24:01.007
Can I chase the chickens?

24:01.041 --> 24:03.176
No, you can't chase
the chickens.

24:08.515 --> 24:11.484
Question.

24:11.518 --> 24:14.487
Am I wrong, or is that
closet full of newspapers?

24:15.956 --> 24:17.490
Not full.

24:17.524 --> 24:18.925
Only head‐high.

24:21.628 --> 24:23.597
Oh, I see.

24:23.630 --> 24:26.967
Alright, so I got
a few for my family

24:27.000 --> 24:28.735
friends.

24:28.769 --> 24:31.237
And a lot for
my enemies.

24:31.271 --> 24:33.607
High school
graduation class

24:33.640 --> 24:35.075
Time, Life..

24:37.678 --> 24:40.614
[theme music]

24:57.263 --> 25:00.000
[music continues]
