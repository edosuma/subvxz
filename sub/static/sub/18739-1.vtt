02:41.162 --> 02:42.594
Shit.

02:42.596 --> 02:44.630
Shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit.

02:53.273 --> 02:56.441
In other news,
the case of the missing boy.

02:56.443 --> 02:58.944
The child goes by
the name of l.P.

02:58.946 --> 03:01.480
And he has long,
girl-like hair

03:01.482 --> 03:03.815
and the face of a prince.

03:03.817 --> 03:06.552
He has been missing
for three days,

03:06.554 --> 03:09.321
so, folks,
keep your eyes peeled.

03:09.323 --> 03:12.357
And now for some jazz.

04:00.540 --> 04:03.008
Oh, fuck!

04:11.518 --> 04:12.985
--What the fuck are you doing?

04:12.987 --> 04:15.654
-What? What?
-Oh, Jesus. Again?

04:15.656 --> 04:17.456
What the hell
is wrong with you?

04:17.458 --> 04:20.791
-Nothing.
-You were pissing in
my goddamn sink.

04:20.793 --> 04:24.596
It's my goddamn sink, too.
It's our goddamn house.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.632
Don't pick a fight with me
just to change the subject.

04:26.634 --> 04:29.635
You just pissed
in our goddamn sink

04:29.637 --> 04:31.937
after I've asked you not to.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.972
Should I just start
leaving my bloody tampons
on your pillow?

04:33.974 --> 04:36.875
-Jesus, relax.
-Don't tell me to relax.

04:36.877 --> 04:38.644
Don't ever tell a woman
to relax.

04:38.646 --> 04:41.046
I have a voice.
I deserve to be heard.

04:41.048 --> 04:45.651
Baby, baby, it's too early
for all of this, all right?

04:45.653 --> 04:48.654
You beat me to the shower
so I pissed in the sink.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.956
I'm sorry.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.791
I promise it won't
happen again.

04:52.793 --> 04:55.294
It was stupid.
It was dumb.

04:55.296 --> 04:57.696
Dumb.
It was really dumb.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.799
Why don't you get dressed

05:00.801 --> 05:02.868
and I'll finish
making breakfast.

05:02.870 --> 05:05.704
If you think I'm eating
your urine-splattered eggs,

05:05.706 --> 05:09.875
then you are dumb.
"Dumb. Really dumb."

05:09.877 --> 05:11.877
Yeah, she won't eat
my urine-splattered eggs,

05:11.879 --> 05:13.712
but she'll put
my dick in her mouth.

05:13.714 --> 05:16.048
-I'm sorry. What?
-What? Rose?

05:16.050 --> 05:19.051
Oh, we'll see
if I put your dick
in my mouth now.

05:19.053 --> 05:20.552
Oh, yeah, great, honey.

05:20.554 --> 05:22.421
Use sex like blackmail,
that's great.

05:22.423 --> 05:24.856
To blackmail you?
What is this,
a murder mystery?

05:24.858 --> 05:27.492
You're a child.
Grow up.

05:27.494 --> 05:28.860
You're a disgusting pig.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.696
What?
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

05:30.698 --> 05:33.699
Yeah, I'm the child, right?
Because I play with toys.

05:33.701 --> 05:36.368
"You need to grow up,
you fat pig."

05:36.370 --> 05:39.638
That's what they used to say
when I was in third grade,

05:39.640 --> 05:42.040
-and I'm the adult?
-I didn't say anything
about the toys.

05:42.042 --> 05:44.509
And I didn't call you fat.
I called you disgusting.

05:44.511 --> 05:45.877
Oh, yeah,
that's a little bit
more grown-up.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.713
You did call me dumb
three times.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.715
Just let it go.
I'm going to be late.

05:49.717 --> 05:52.851
Just don't talk to me
for five minutes.

06:18.444 --> 06:20.379
You're not even...

06:26.953 --> 06:29.788
You're not even going to
try your toast, even?

06:29.790 --> 06:32.758
No, I'm not.
Thanks.

06:32.760 --> 06:36.762
Hey, I said I was sorry,
and I meant it.

06:36.764 --> 06:37.929
It's fine.
I'm fine.

06:37.931 --> 06:40.599
I'm a little bit
grossed out

06:40.601 --> 06:45.437
and I got upset,
but it's no big deal.

06:45.439 --> 06:46.838
Okay.

06:48.775 --> 06:52.611
Remember to pay the gas
and electric bills.

06:52.613 --> 06:57.115
-I will.
-Checks are in the
envelopes by the door.

06:57.117 --> 07:00.786
-No problem.
-And the dry cleaning.

07:00.788 --> 07:03.121
-I will grab it.
-My new dress is in there.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.991
-Ooh, the white one.
-Green one.

07:05.993 --> 07:07.993
Right, the green one.
I like the green one.

07:07.995 --> 07:09.828
The green one's sexy.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.997
It's nothing fancy.
It's just a green dress,

07:11.999 --> 07:13.732
but I want to
wear it tonight.

07:15.501 --> 07:17.002
What's tonight?

07:17.004 --> 07:18.170
What do you mean,
what's tonight?

07:18.172 --> 07:21.840
-Dinner with cam.
-Cam? Cam.

07:21.842 --> 07:24.176
Camilian daily?

07:24.178 --> 07:26.178
You forgot?
Anthony, you forgot?

07:26.180 --> 07:28.847
Jesus, you said
you were going to cook.
It was your idea.

07:28.849 --> 07:32.851
It's my idea?
I don't think so.

07:32.853 --> 07:35.687
You invited him at
unqiue's housewarming party.

07:35.689 --> 07:37.823
Why would I do that?
I don't even like the guy.

07:37.825 --> 07:40.992
You are so closed-minded.
He's really helped me.

07:40.994 --> 07:42.828
I know, I mean,
and that's great.

07:42.830 --> 07:44.496
That's good for you.
I like that. That's good.

07:44.498 --> 07:46.498
Then why don't you
like him then?

07:46.500 --> 07:47.699
I don't know, he's just--

07:47.701 --> 07:50.669
he's a little--
wait, what the hell?

07:50.671 --> 07:51.837
What kind of name
is "unique"?

07:51.839 --> 07:54.506
Is that an actual
person name?

07:54.508 --> 07:55.841
Is there somebody
named that?

07:55.843 --> 07:59.010
What? I don't--
housewarming party?

07:59.012 --> 08:01.079
Do you pay attention
to anything?

08:02.682 --> 08:04.583
I have never met
a single person

08:04.585 --> 08:06.918
in my whole life
named unique.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.621
I would remember that.
That's a unique name.

08:09.623 --> 08:11.089
-Last Saturday night.
-Last Saturday?

08:11.091 --> 08:13.258
Where the hell
do you think you were?

08:13.260 --> 08:14.993
Last Saturday?

08:16.262 --> 08:18.263
Oh, Jesus.

08:18.265 --> 08:20.098
I can't do this right now.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.767
Wait, that was her name?
Unique was her name?

08:22.769 --> 08:25.103
It was a housewarm--
shit, I was drunk.

08:25.105 --> 08:27.606
Just pay the bills
and go to the cleaners

08:27.608 --> 08:29.608
and try to get
some work done.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.142
Try not to spend
the whole day

08:31.144 --> 08:33.611
-looking at your toy books.
-They're not toy books.

08:33.614 --> 08:37.015
They're pricing books
for collector toys, all right?

08:37.017 --> 08:39.284
Look, you knew that
when we started dating

08:39.285 --> 08:41.653
that I was a toy collector,
that this was my passion.

08:41.655 --> 08:44.789
Oh, god.
It's more like an addiction.

08:44.791 --> 08:46.958
What, because
collecting these antiques

08:46.960 --> 08:48.693
is going to solve
world hunger?

08:48.695 --> 08:50.795
Yeah, and toy collecting
is curing cancer.

08:50.797 --> 08:52.964
Oh, touchÃ©.
So look at that,

08:52.966 --> 08:55.133
all of the sudden
we have something in common.

08:55.135 --> 08:56.968
Well, if you think
we're so different,

08:56.970 --> 08:58.737
then we don't
have to do this.

08:58.739 --> 09:01.206
We don't have to do what?

09:01.208 --> 09:02.707
Nothing. Forget it.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.109
No, what did
you mean by that?

09:04.111 --> 09:05.577
Just shut up!

09:05.579 --> 09:06.778
I'm just saying,
get some work done.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.880
There's--

09:08.882 --> 09:10.282
there's nicer ways
of saying that.

09:10.284 --> 09:11.783
It's fine.

09:11.785 --> 09:13.718
Okay, it's fine.
It's fine.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.720
I got to go.

09:15.722 --> 09:18.189
Please, the bills
and the cleaners

09:18.191 --> 09:20.625
and dinner,
and I'm picking cam up--

09:20.627 --> 09:22.027
I know. You told me.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.862
I know.
You told me three time--

09:23.864 --> 09:25.564
wait a second.
You're picking cam up?

09:25.566 --> 09:26.865
Yeah, that's right.
He doesn't own a car.

09:26.867 --> 09:30.635
Guy doesn't own a car?

09:30.637 --> 09:34.039
What? Does he
not believe in the evils
of the automobile?

09:34.041 --> 09:37.042
I'll have you know,
the automobile had been
around a long time,

09:37.044 --> 09:39.110
longer than even
the toaster was invented.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.712
What are you even
talking about?

09:40.714 --> 09:42.347
You don't have a car.

09:42.349 --> 09:45.884
I don't own a car
not because I don't like cars.

09:45.886 --> 09:48.219
I like cars.
I can't afford a car.

09:48.221 --> 09:50.722
But as soon
as I get enough money,
I'm going to get a car.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.824
You invited him.
It made me happy.

09:52.826 --> 09:55.694
I thought for a moment
you were actually starting
to open up about it.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.996
Now I'm wondering
why you even did so
in the first place.

09:57.998 --> 10:00.365
-Because I was drunk.
-God. Okay, I got to go.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.867
We'll be here around 8:00.
Please have dinner ready.

10:02.869 --> 10:05.604
-What am I cooking?
-Oh, you don't remember?

10:05.606 --> 10:07.038
No. What am I cooking?

10:07.040 --> 10:09.374
You're making
a roasted pumpkin feta

10:09.376 --> 10:12.811
over quinoa salad
with white gazpacho soup.

10:12.813 --> 10:15.947
You said three things
and I don't know
what they are.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.882
Yeah, well,
you said you'd made it
a thousand times,

10:17.884 --> 10:18.917
which was news to me.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.719
Why would I say that?

10:20.721 --> 10:22.020
Unique said she ate it,

10:22.022 --> 10:23.388
and you jumped in with,
"i can make that."

10:23.390 --> 10:26.358
-I did?
-Oh, god.
I don't know.

10:26.360 --> 10:27.859
Just figure it out.
I got to go.

10:27.861 --> 10:29.094
You're a good cook

10:29.096 --> 10:30.295
when you're
not pissing on it.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.197
Jesus Christ,
cut me some slack.

10:32.199 --> 10:34.199
I didn't piss
on breakfast, okay?

10:34.201 --> 10:36.201
You don't have to be
all cunty and naggy about it.

10:36.203 --> 10:38.203
-I'm late.
-Okay.

10:38.205 --> 10:40.305
Hey, I'm sorry.
I love--

11:01.027 --> 11:04.763
slammed the door
in my fucking face

11:04.765 --> 11:08.433
telling you
i fucking love you.

11:08.435 --> 11:11.936
That's bullshit.
It's fucking bullshit.

11:11.938 --> 11:13.938
I will fucking shit

11:13.940 --> 11:17.776
in your fucking dinner
you fucking cunt.

11:17.778 --> 11:19.944
I will fucking do it.
I will fucking do it.

11:19.946 --> 11:21.780
I will fucking do it.
I will shit in it.

11:21.782 --> 11:25.450
You and that fucking fag,
that cam fucking daily.

11:25.452 --> 11:28.953
Are you fucking kidding me?

11:28.955 --> 11:32.190
Are you fucking
kidding me?

11:35.928 --> 11:37.829
Fucking...

11:42.101 --> 11:46.938
I am so sick of the way
that you bark at me

11:46.940 --> 11:49.774
like I'm some sort
of fucking dog.

11:49.776 --> 11:51.109
And what do I do?

11:51.111 --> 11:53.111
I fucking act like
a goddamn dog.

11:53.113 --> 11:55.447
You smack me
on my fucking nose
and I go running.

11:55.449 --> 11:56.948
And you fucking
call me back

11:56.950 --> 11:58.283
and I go fucking
running back

11:58.285 --> 11:59.884
and you smack me
on my fucking nose again.

11:59.886 --> 12:02.954
Fucking dog.
You fucking dog.

12:02.956 --> 12:06.357
That is no way
to be treated.

12:06.359 --> 12:08.827
That's bullshit.
That's fucking bullshit.

12:08.829 --> 12:12.864
That is bullshit.

12:12.866 --> 12:16.034
That's bullshit.

12:16.036 --> 12:20.371
I do not deserve to be
fucking treated that way.

12:20.373 --> 12:22.741
Yeah, that's not the way
that you treat people.

12:22.743 --> 12:25.376
That is not
the way you do it.

12:25.378 --> 12:27.045
That is not the way
you treat people.

12:27.047 --> 12:28.747
That's not the way
you fucking do it.

12:28.749 --> 12:34.052
I would never do that.
I would never do that.

12:34.054 --> 12:36.387
Why the fuck would I put up
with shit from you,

12:36.389 --> 12:37.889
you fucking cunt?

12:37.891 --> 12:40.125
God, I love you.
Fuck you.

12:40.127 --> 12:42.861
Aroo-roo-roo-roo!

12:46.032 --> 12:48.867
You want a fucking dog?
I will give you a fucking dog.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.869
I'll give you a hellhound.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.036
Aroo-aroo!

12:53.874 --> 12:58.543
I will fucking tear you apart
and shit in your dinner.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.120
This is rose.
I'm away from the garden.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.455
Please leave me a message.

13:12.125 --> 13:15.093
Hi, sweetie. Hi.
Hi, it's me again.

13:15.095 --> 13:17.061
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry again.

13:17.063 --> 13:20.398
I was a jackass,
and I'm excited for dinner.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.000
--And I miss you.

13:37.116 --> 13:39.284
Oh, yeah.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.820
I have all this shit.
I can't--

13:41.822 --> 13:42.954
I can't believe it.

13:42.956 --> 13:45.123
I don't have to
go to the store.

13:45.125 --> 13:48.426
Nice. All I got to do
is cook it up now,

13:48.428 --> 13:49.928
heat it later,

13:49.930 --> 13:51.863
serve it up
like a "champeen."

14:04.510 --> 14:07.512
Hi, Mrs. basil.
Hi, my name is Anthony prince.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.180
I lost you there
for a second.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.416
Yeah, I'm calling from
the superior breath

14:11.418 --> 14:13.351
burial insurance company.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.886
That's right.
That's right.

14:14.888 --> 14:16.521
We're having a discount
in November--

14:16.523 --> 14:19.357
30% off within
seven days of the funeral.

14:19.359 --> 14:22.327
Not only that,
but you obviously would
get that included

14:22.329 --> 14:24.062
with the policy
of your choice.

14:24.064 --> 14:25.496
My name is Anthony prince.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.198
I'm calling on behalf of...

14:27.200 --> 14:29.200
Hi, my name
is Anthony prince...

14:29.202 --> 14:30.401
That's right,
it's insurance...

14:30.403 --> 14:32.537
Superior breath
burial insurance...

14:32.539 --> 14:34.539
Every member of
the family is covered,

14:34.541 --> 14:36.374
and that includes your pet.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.543
Hello, my name is
anthon-- no.

14:38.545 --> 14:41.045
This product is ideal
for people who bleed true

14:41.047 --> 14:42.914
for their team,
country, or religion.

14:42.916 --> 14:44.048
Your team will feel
your support

14:44.050 --> 14:46.050
years after your death.

14:46.052 --> 14:48.920
It doesn't mean
you don't deserve
superior insurance.

14:48.922 --> 14:51.222
If your depression worsens,
and let's say,

14:51.224 --> 14:52.924
god forbid,
the worst happens

14:52.926 --> 14:54.359
and you do what
you say you might do,

14:54.361 --> 14:56.027
you want to leave
your family secure.

14:56.029 --> 14:58.363
Imagine your family
sitting at your funeral,

14:58.365 --> 15:00.365
crying,
weeping for your loss.

15:00.367 --> 15:01.900
...in case you die.

15:01.902 --> 15:03.368
You know what?
I'm not wasting my time.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.603
This is a job.
This is a real job.

15:05.605 --> 15:08.439
My name is--
no? All right.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.441
...adult child.

15:10.443 --> 15:13.611
It can't be
a 14-year-old type adult.

15:13.613 --> 15:16.114
The last one I sold

15:16.116 --> 15:17.615
to a 45-year-old man
who acted like a 6-year-old.

15:17.617 --> 15:19.284
It's awful.
I hate my job.

15:19.286 --> 15:21.119
Please, call me
and give me a fucking--

15:21.121 --> 15:23.121
I hate my job.

15:23.123 --> 15:26.291
Good morning. Greetings
and salutations, Mr. blue.

15:26.293 --> 15:27.959
-Is it Mr. blue?
-That's me.

15:27.961 --> 15:30.094
It is. Okay, great.
Mr. blue, hello.

15:30.096 --> 15:31.596
My name is Anthony prince.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.598
I'm calling on behalf
of the superior breath

15:33.600 --> 15:35.600
burial insurance company.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.270
we have a 30% discount
on all of our policies.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.439
That's right,
up to and including

15:41.441 --> 15:43.975
every policy
you purchase today.

15:43.977 --> 15:45.610

15:48.114 --> 15:49.614

15:49.616 --> 15:51.449
Now, do you have a moment?

15:51.451 --> 15:53.184
I can run by some of
our policies with you.

15:53.186 --> 15:55.153
Yeah, okay.

15:55.155 --> 15:57.288
-You do?
-I do.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.290
All right.
All right, Mr. blue.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.592
-All right.
-You can call me Dale.

16:01.594 --> 16:06.030
Dale. Dale it is.
Yes, sir, Dale.

16:06.032 --> 16:08.032
Okay, let's start with
our top policy.

16:08.034 --> 16:09.500
Let's just start
right off there--

16:09.502 --> 16:11.669
the superior preferred
whole life plan.

16:11.671 --> 16:13.404
That sounds like you,
doesn't it, Dale?

16:15.175 --> 16:17.041
Come on! T-bone!

16:17.043 --> 16:19.377
-Shit. Hold on,
Mr. blue.
-What?

16:22.181 --> 16:23.681
It doesn't take
X-ray vision

16:23.683 --> 16:25.350
to see you're in there, man.

16:25.352 --> 16:27.518
Shit, shit.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.754
Stevie wonder could see
you're in there.

16:29.756 --> 16:33.524
Hey. How you doing?

16:33.526 --> 16:34.625
What are you
doing here, snake?

16:39.331 --> 16:42.333
What's with the cold
renovations, brother?

16:42.335 --> 16:44.502
It looks like a fucking
haunted house in here.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.337
-Hey, man.
-No, no, no.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.172
You smell like a brewery.
You smell like a brewery.

16:48.174 --> 16:49.674
It's not even
10:00 A.M., man.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.342
-Hey, hey, hey.
-What? What?

16:51.344 --> 16:53.578
Is old mama Hitler here?

16:53.580 --> 16:56.180
No. No, she's not,
and don't call her that.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.548
Don't call her that.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.517
-Goddamn it.
-Look, I can
smell the clit.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.519
-Goddamn it, man.
-I can smell the clit.

17:01.521 --> 17:05.256
I'm fucking working here.

17:05.258 --> 17:07.724
You fucking animal.
I'm working.

17:07.727 --> 17:10.094
Yeah, I'm working here!

17:10.096 --> 17:12.396
-Mr. blue.
-Oh, clown bozo.

17:12.398 --> 17:14.098
--Oh, man.

17:14.099 --> 17:16.099
Fuck, man.
Where are the fucking

17:16.102 --> 17:20.238
bozo the clown shooters

17:20.240 --> 17:23.241
These are superb
collectibles, man.

17:23.242 --> 17:25.108
They should be
on fucking display here

17:25.111 --> 17:26.743
on the wall
of fucking fame.

17:26.746 --> 17:29.147
What are you
talking about?

17:29.149 --> 17:30.381
What do you got here?
What are you doing?

17:30.383 --> 17:32.550
Give me that.
Give me the bottle.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.352
Give it here.

17:35.822 --> 17:36.821
Give me the bottle.

17:39.759 --> 17:42.727
Get the fuck off.

17:42.729 --> 17:45.830
What are you doing?
Give me the bottle.

17:45.832 --> 17:47.331
No, no, no.

17:47.333 --> 17:49.067
No, no, no, no.

17:50.537 --> 17:54.238
What are you trying to do?
Kill yourself?

17:54.240 --> 17:56.741
Aw, shit.

17:56.743 --> 17:59.243
Aww.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.245
Shit.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.848
Aw, shit.
Look what you made me do.

18:03.850 --> 18:05.416
I made you do it?

18:05.418 --> 18:07.318
I just fucking got here.
I didn't do shit.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.587
What is wrong with you, man?

18:09.589 --> 18:12.557
I have to go to the store now,
you asshole.

18:12.559 --> 18:16.227
I'm sick.
I'm sick here, man.

18:16.229 --> 18:17.462
I know.
You need some help.

18:17.464 --> 18:20.331
No, you don't--
you don't know.

18:20.333 --> 18:24.702
Anthony, I'm serious.
I'm sick, man.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.471
What are you talking about?

18:26.473 --> 18:28.639
I don't know how
to tell you this, man.

18:28.641 --> 18:32.110
I'm sick, man.

18:32.112 --> 18:35.279
-I got the aids.
-What?

18:35.281 --> 18:37.315
I got aids.

18:37.317 --> 18:40.485
Are you serious?

18:40.487 --> 18:42.620
I'm dying.

18:42.622 --> 18:45.690
Shit.

18:45.692 --> 18:51.262
I thought
it was crohn's disease,
but it's aids.

18:52.631 --> 18:54.832
Aw, shit.

18:56.302 --> 18:59.537
What am I going to do, man?

18:59.539 --> 19:02.740
Fuck, man.
I'm so sorry, buddy.

19:02.742 --> 19:07.378
I'm so sorry, man.

19:07.380 --> 19:09.547
It's going to be all right.
That's fine.

19:09.549 --> 19:11.415
It's going to be okay.

19:11.417 --> 19:13.251
There's a lot of people that
live a long time with aids.

19:13.253 --> 19:14.685
Look at magic Johnson.

19:14.687 --> 19:18.389
That guy's had aids
for 30 fucking years, man.

19:18.391 --> 19:21.259
He's done great for himself.
It's going to be all right.

19:24.531 --> 19:26.531
Shit. What can I do?

19:33.238 --> 19:34.872
Shit, man.

19:34.874 --> 19:37.708
Can I have
soldier boy back?

19:37.710 --> 19:39.710
What?

19:39.712 --> 19:43.381
I thought it would be nice
to be buried with him.

19:43.383 --> 19:45.883
Aw, you asshole.

19:45.885 --> 19:48.386
No, no.
You got me.

19:48.388 --> 19:50.388
Fuck you, you asshole.

19:50.390 --> 19:53.257
You're a real asshole,
you know that?

19:53.259 --> 19:56.227
You're a real asshole.
No. God, no.

19:56.229 --> 19:57.862
No. Get out.
Come on, time's up.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.864
Congratulations,
you fucked me. Let's go.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.532
You fucking owe me, man.

20:01.534 --> 20:02.867
I don't owe you shit.

20:02.869 --> 20:05.369
You owe me for
the fucking hasbro score.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.371
Get over the hasbro
score already.

20:07.373 --> 20:08.873
It was eight
fucking years ago.

20:08.875 --> 20:12.310
Hey, man, if I'd had
the fucking skorponok

20:12.312 --> 20:16.314
in my collectibles
of first gen Decepticons,

20:16.316 --> 20:18.616
-it would have
made a mint.
-You moron.

20:18.618 --> 20:20.318
-You fucked me on that.
-You moron.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.953
That wasn't even in the box.

20:21.955 --> 20:23.988
If anything,
i saved your ass,

20:23.990 --> 20:27.792
because you were about
to lay 250 clams down
on that skorponok.

20:27.794 --> 20:33.297
I saw it on ebay last week
for $14.99, you perp.

20:33.299 --> 20:37.935
-Now, go.
-Just give me
soldier boy back.

20:37.937 --> 20:40.771
No. Deal's a deal.
Let's go.

20:40.773 --> 20:43.608
I thought it would be nice
to be buried with him.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.776
Can't have it.
Let's go.

20:45.778 --> 20:48.613
-But it was my pappy's.
-No. Oh, your pappy?

20:48.615 --> 20:50.948
Did he die of
the aids, too?

20:50.950 --> 20:53.918
You don't get to talk
about my pappy that way.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.954
I'm coming for
soldier boy at 3:00.

20:56.956 --> 21:00.791
-3:00.
-Out. Out.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.927
I'm coming for soldier boy
at 3:00.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.996
-Sober up.
-3:00. 3:00.

21:04.998 --> 21:06.897
-Sober up.
-Three.

21:09.835 --> 21:12.803
Fucking animal.

22:06.591 --> 22:08.759
This is a stetson.

22:08.761 --> 22:11.662
-Oh.
-Yeah, it's a great...

23:01.581 --> 23:04.682
You have three messages.
Message one.

Go, go, go.

23:10.590 --> 23:11.622
Message two.

23:12.992 --> 23:16.527
Shh. Shh. Be quiet.

23:16.529 --> 23:19.530
Message three.

23:19.532 --> 23:20.965
Now listen up.

23:20.967 --> 23:22.967
You know that I know
that you know that much.

23:22.969 --> 23:24.635
You're not dealing
with a chimp here,

23:24.637 --> 23:25.970
but dummy up, fuck face.

23:25.972 --> 23:27.972
Cocksucker.

23:27.974 --> 23:29.840
I want soldier boy back!
Asshole!

23:49.162 --> 23:51.128
This is rose.
I'm away from the garden.

23:51.130 --> 23:53.431
Please leave me a message.

23:53.433 --> 23:56.133
Hi. Rose, hi.
It's Anthony.

23:56.135 --> 23:58.502
Well, you know who it is.
It's me.

23:58.504 --> 24:01.972
I just wanted to tell you
I'm sorry again.

24:01.974 --> 24:03.541
I was just a jackass.

24:03.543 --> 24:07.044
And, um, I took care
of everything for you.

24:07.046 --> 24:10.047
Went to the grocery store
and we got the dry cleaning.

24:10.049 --> 24:12.583
And I've already started
cooking dinner

24:12.585 --> 24:13.918
and I'm very excited.

24:13.920 --> 24:17.621
Call me, and the pumpkin

24:38.744 --> 24:40.611

24:40.613 --> 24:42.613
Would you like it

25:23.523 --> 25:28.158
I can't do this insurance
burial thing anyone.

25:28.160 --> 25:29.693
It's just killing me.

25:29.695 --> 25:31.795
It's sucking
the life out of me.

25:31.797 --> 25:34.031
Oh.

26:08.768 --> 26:12.603
No. What are you doing here?

26:12.605 --> 26:14.071
Why are you out of breath?

26:14.073 --> 26:15.873
I've been running with l.P.
And he's heavy.

26:15.875 --> 26:17.975
-Yeah, right.
-Good day to you,
uncle Anthony.

26:17.977 --> 26:20.311
And to you as well, l.P.

26:20.313 --> 26:22.813
I ate something bad

-Coffee?

26:33.758 --> 26:35.125
Shit. The pumpkin.

26:36.094 --> 26:38.162
Damn it.

26:38.164 --> 26:39.897
New dish?

26:39.899 --> 26:41.665
Yeah.

26:41.667 --> 26:44.868
Making a special meal
for aunt rose and her friend.

26:44.870 --> 26:48.772
-Friend?
-Yeah, a doctor.

26:48.774 --> 26:51.976
I see. Now what?

26:51.978 --> 26:56.614
I think I have enough
ingredients for another try.

26:56.616 --> 26:57.881
Smart.

27:06.157 --> 27:08.859
That sure is a mean cup
of java, uncle a.

27:08.861 --> 27:11.228
You really are
a brew master.

27:17.669 --> 27:19.003
That hit the spot.

27:19.005 --> 27:21.905
I haven't had
a decent cup in days.

27:23.141 --> 27:25.976
What's the deal, l.P.?

27:25.978 --> 27:30.314
Why is you dad eating out
of the L.A. river?

27:30.316 --> 27:32.816
This is really good.
You have a pen and paper?

27:32.818 --> 27:35.019
Pen and paper?

27:35.021 --> 27:37.921
Uh, yeah.

27:42.994 --> 27:45.129
Do you mind?

27:45.131 --> 27:47.164
No. Chew 'em
if you got 'em.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.066
Thanks.

27:52.137 --> 27:54.972
All right,
what's the story?

27:54.974 --> 27:57.675
Will you draw me
a sheep?

27:57.677 --> 27:59.143
I don't know
how to draw a sheep.

27:59.145 --> 28:00.844
Just draw me a sheep.

28:00.846 --> 28:02.312
Why?

28:02.314 --> 28:05.015
I saw it in a book once.
Draw me a sheep.

28:05.017 --> 28:07.918
No, not until you tell me
what's going on.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.386
Your dad said you guys
were in trouble.

28:09.388 --> 28:13.757
Look, uncle a. Needs you
to focus for a moment.

28:13.759 --> 28:16.126
-Tell me what's the matter.
-Just draw me a sheep.

28:16.128 --> 28:18.429
Now's not the--

28:18.431 --> 28:21.065
now is not the time
for drawing, l.P.

28:21.067 --> 28:23.934
I think the explanation
of this very important matter

28:23.936 --> 28:27.071
would be best coming from
the mouth of an adult.

28:27.073 --> 28:29.473
All right, I'm sorry.

28:29.475 --> 28:31.275
I didn't mean to
condescend to you.

28:31.277 --> 28:34.411
Whoo, brother!

28:34.413 --> 28:38.082
Motherfucker,
it feels so good to shit
in a real toilet.

28:38.084 --> 28:43.253
I swear, my life's
a living hell on earth
these past few days.

28:43.255 --> 28:46.824
-Jesus Christ.
-Skip the foreplay.
Get right into it.

28:46.826 --> 28:49.259
-Like an episode
of fucking "cops."
-Language.

28:49.261 --> 28:51.095
I'm frickin'
on the lam, bro.

28:51.097 --> 28:52.763
I'm on the run
like Bruce Springsteen
right now.

28:52.765 --> 28:55.733
-That's "born to run."
-Whatever.

28:55.735 --> 28:58.068
-Well, who's chasing you?
-Local law enforcement,

28:58.070 --> 29:01.772
FBI, CIA,
homeland security.

29:01.774 --> 29:04.074
-The fuck did you do?
Kill the president?
-Language.

29:04.076 --> 29:06.310
You think I'd do something
stupid like that?

29:06.312 --> 29:09.146
Kill the president?
I love this country.

29:09.148 --> 29:11.315
And what the fuck?
When did you think
i became a racist?

29:11.317 --> 29:13.851
I didn't. What the fuck
are you talking about?

29:13.853 --> 29:16.854
I wouldn't kill
a black person, would I?

29:16.856 --> 29:19.490
For no fucking reason?
Are you kidding?

29:19.492 --> 29:21.325
I didn't say you would.
You said you were going to
kill the president.

29:21.327 --> 29:22.860
I didn't call you a racist.

29:22.862 --> 29:24.161
What the fuck
are you talking about?

29:24.163 --> 29:26.830
-Language.
-All right, I'm sorry.

29:26.832 --> 29:28.999
Now, please,
would somebody just tell me
what's going on?

29:29.001 --> 29:31.135
Yeah, well, to do that,

29:31.137 --> 29:32.336
I'd have to start
at the beginning

29:32.338 --> 29:35.272
with me and foxy
when we separated--

29:35.274 --> 29:37.207
-a while ago.
-Yeah, like, a while now.

29:37.209 --> 29:39.777
-Eight fucking
months a while.
-Language.

29:39.779 --> 29:42.279
This is f-- fricked!

29:42.281 --> 29:44.047
I'm so fricked right now!

29:44.049 --> 29:46.150
All right, focus.

29:46.152 --> 29:47.551
Start from the beginning.

29:47.553 --> 29:49.019
In the beginning,

29:49.021 --> 29:51.488
between me and foxy,
it was good--

29:51.490 --> 29:54.825
so good we ended up
with a beautiful baby
love child good.

29:54.827 --> 29:58.328
-Thanks, pops.
-Yeah, you got it.

29:58.330 --> 30:01.231
After those first
three years go by, though?

30:03.002 --> 30:06.370
Shit gets bad fast.

30:06.372 --> 30:09.439
A woman can turn into a bitch.

30:09.441 --> 30:11.308
Okay.

30:11.310 --> 30:14.845
I still don't know
what's going on at all.

30:14.847 --> 30:16.880
We fight all the time.

30:18.583 --> 30:20.450
I can't take her anymore.

30:20.452 --> 30:22.486
All right, I still
don't know what's going on.

30:22.488 --> 30:24.288
Things have been complicated
for a while now,

30:24.290 --> 30:26.490
and it's gotten
very complicated.

30:26.492 --> 30:28.158
I'm in big trouble.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.527
Long story short,
I'm in fucking trouble.

30:30.529 --> 30:32.029
What the frick is going on?

30:39.838 --> 30:42.940
We will have more on
what scientists are calling

30:42.942 --> 30:47.211
the tiniest
newly-discovered planet
later in the hour.

30:47.213 --> 30:50.480
Now, in the case
of the missing boy,

30:50.482 --> 30:53.483
the police say they have
a new lead suspect

30:53.485 --> 30:56.186
and they are following up
on the leads

30:56.188 --> 30:59.156
leading to the lead suspect
in the case.

30:59.158 --> 31:02.025
We got a new
lead suspect in the case
of the missing boy.

31:02.027 --> 31:03.861
You can rest assured
we're going to
follow that lead

31:03.863 --> 31:06.096
until it leads us
to its logical end.

31:06.098 --> 31:09.933
It's what leaders do.
We follow leads.

31:09.935 --> 31:11.902
I wouldn't expect you
to understand that.

31:11.904 --> 31:14.071
Don't even--
don't even try.

31:14.073 --> 31:15.372
Don't even try
to comprehend it.

31:15.374 --> 31:17.241
The child's name is l.P.

31:17.243 --> 31:19.610
He was kidnapped
three days ago

31:19.612 --> 31:22.212
from the playground
at Sahara park

31:22.214 --> 31:25.382
at 10:31 A.M.
Friday morning

31:25.384 --> 31:29.519
by a man wearing all black
with a black ski mask.

31:31.256 --> 31:33.223
This just in.

31:33.225 --> 31:36.226
The leading suspect is
in fact the boy's father

31:36.228 --> 31:38.362
Barbra prince.

31:38.364 --> 31:41.965
So far this Barbra man
is nowhere to be found.

31:41.967 --> 31:46.403
A not-so-bright neighbor
to Mr. babs prince said,

31:46.405 --> 31:49.406
and I quote,
"i think he told me to say

31:49.408 --> 31:53.543
he was away on a business trip
to France or something

31:53.545 --> 31:57.247
with his son or something,
i think."

31:57.249 --> 32:00.250
The neighbor is to remain
nameless at this point,

32:00.252 --> 32:02.219
but is being held
for questioning.

32:02.221 --> 32:06.490
The alleged suspect,
who sometimes goes by "babs",

32:06.492 --> 32:08.659
has had a recent history
of violence.

32:08.661 --> 32:13.330
He may be dangerous.
Please stay alert.

32:13.332 --> 32:15.599
You kidnapped your son.

32:15.601 --> 32:20.671
No, that's impossible.
I'm his father, dumbass.

32:20.673 --> 32:23.173
Well, apparently it is,
because you did.

32:23.175 --> 32:25.342
Because of that?
What do they know?

32:25.344 --> 32:28.211
They think you're dangerous,
for one.

32:28.213 --> 32:31.214
I might have beat up a ref
at a basketball game

32:31.216 --> 32:33.317
-a couple weeks back.
-Why did you do this?

32:33.319 --> 32:37.187
You know how foxy gets.
She's strong.

32:37.189 --> 32:39.089
And I don't think.
I react.

32:39.091 --> 32:43.327
-What did she do?
-She makes fun of me.

32:43.329 --> 32:45.495
She made fun of you?
That's it?

32:45.497 --> 32:47.164
No. That's not it.

32:47.166 --> 32:49.566
She called me
a dumb fucking cracker.

32:49.568 --> 32:51.234
Language.

32:51.236 --> 32:53.637
It was your mother
who said it.

32:53.639 --> 32:56.173
Now let the men talk here
for a second.

32:56.175 --> 32:59.643
I've been dealing
with her shit, her threats.

32:59.645 --> 33:03.714
She's using l.P. As a weapon
to make me jealous!

33:03.716 --> 33:06.984
Okay. So, just,
what's the plan?

33:08.419 --> 33:12.622
-Jesus Christ.
-Yeah, I know this is bad.

33:12.624 --> 33:14.257
Yeah, it's bad, man.
It's bad.

33:14.259 --> 33:15.759
This is your bad.
You did this.

33:15.761 --> 33:18.095
God! Pointing the finger
at me again?

33:18.097 --> 33:20.597
You're always blaming me,
pointing the finger at me!

33:20.599 --> 33:23.200
I'm not blaming you,
you dumb fuck.

33:23.202 --> 33:26.236
Yeah. That's exactly
what foxy calls me.

33:26.238 --> 33:29.373
I was being ironic,
you dumb fuck.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.174
You want to call me
dumb fuck again?

33:32.410 --> 33:34.411
Huh? Go ahead.
Call me dumb fuck.

33:34.413 --> 33:38.715
Can I suggest
that we all sit down
over a nice lunch

33:38.717 --> 33:41.451
and sort this out
on a full belly?

33:43.254 --> 33:46.390
-It's not a bad idea.
-I'm starving.

33:58.736 --> 34:00.637
You can't stay here, man.

34:00.639 --> 34:04.241
-Why not?
-Why not?

34:04.243 --> 34:07.444
Because I won't be
an accomplice to your crime.

34:07.446 --> 34:10.614
They've already detained
your neighbor for doing so.

34:10.616 --> 34:13.150
Besides, Rosie would
never stand for this,

34:13.152 --> 34:15.152
and we have company
coming over for dinner,

34:15.154 --> 34:17.320
which I've already burnt twice
and need to start making.

34:17.322 --> 34:20.322
-So, no.
-Yeah, yeah. Bullshit.

34:20.324 --> 34:22.626
You burned dinner twice?

34:22.628 --> 34:24.094
You're in luck.

34:24.096 --> 34:26.263
I'm the best
prep cook you know.

34:26.264 --> 34:27.764
And I'm your brother.

34:27.766 --> 34:28.831
Come on, man.

34:34.472 --> 34:35.472
You kidnapped your son!

34:36.608 --> 34:40.143
Shit.
It's probably snake.

34:40.145 --> 34:41.445
Prince?

34:41.447 --> 34:43.246
This is office feltcher
and office recum

34:43.248 --> 34:45.081
from the Los Angeles
police department.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.783
We're here to ask you
a couple questions.

34:46.784 --> 34:49.518
Shh. Be very quiet.
In the back. In the back.

34:52.322 --> 34:54.524
Very quiet.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.468
Good morning.
Oh, is it afternoon?

35:04.470 --> 35:07.838
God, I must have really
crashed out, officers...

35:07.840 --> 35:09.473
Recum.

35:09.475 --> 35:13.243
Officer feltcher.
Those are interesting names.

35:13.245 --> 35:15.412
It's interesting that I took
my wife's maiden name?

35:15.414 --> 35:17.114
I think it's beautiful.

35:17.116 --> 35:18.715
-Are you Anthony prince?
-Brother to Barbra prince?

35:18.717 --> 35:20.250
Yes, sir.
Barbra's my brother.

35:20.252 --> 35:22.219
What kind of name
is "Barbra" for a man?

35:22.221 --> 35:23.420
It's a family name, sir.

35:23.422 --> 35:25.755
It's our grandmother's name.

35:25.757 --> 35:27.390
I've had it up to here
with this guy.

35:27.392 --> 35:28.758
I am so sick
of his business.

35:28.760 --> 35:29.860
Have you seen your brother

35:29.862 --> 35:30.861
or had contact with him

35:30.863 --> 35:32.496
in the last 72 hours?

35:32.498 --> 35:33.563
No. Why?
What's going on?

35:33.565 --> 35:36.199
Is he okay?
Is he dead?

35:36.201 --> 35:38.502
Do you not know
what's going on with
your family?

35:38.504 --> 35:40.770
Do you now pay attention
to the news, son?

35:40.772 --> 35:42.305
The news?
I've been asleep.

35:42.307 --> 35:44.574
-It's a big story.
-You don't TiVo?

35:44.576 --> 35:46.209
-TiVo?
-TiVo?

35:46.211 --> 35:47.878
You record programs
and then you watch them--

35:47.880 --> 35:50.747
I know what TiVo is, I do.
But just say "dvr."

35:50.749 --> 35:52.682
He knew what
i was talking about.

35:52.684 --> 35:54.684
-TiVo is the brand.
Dvr is the larger--
-doesn't matter.

35:54.686 --> 35:56.586
The Internet is another place
to get good information.

35:56.588 --> 35:57.821
Lot of good options there.

35:57.823 --> 35:59.356
Yeah. I don't have
a computer.

35:59.358 --> 36:01.525
-Oh.
-Wow.

36:01.527 --> 36:02.792
Now you're trying
to be smart with us.

36:02.794 --> 36:05.295
-Oh, ho, ho!
-No, I'm being serious.

36:05.297 --> 36:06.897
I don't have a computer.

36:06.899 --> 36:08.298
You need to walk
your little ass

36:08.300 --> 36:09.566
down to a radio shack
and pick one up,

36:09.568 --> 36:10.901
because you're
going to need it.

36:10.903 --> 36:12.369
Yeah, because Barbra's
the lead suspect

36:12.371 --> 36:13.937
in the kidnapping
of your nephew.

36:13.939 --> 36:16.273
Kidnapped?
But that's his own son.

36:16.275 --> 36:18.775
You can't kidnap
your own child.

36:18.777 --> 36:20.477
Are you guys kidding?

36:20.479 --> 36:23.813
Does it look like
we're kidding?

36:23.815 --> 36:26.183
No. And he did.

36:26.185 --> 36:27.784
Listen, if you have any more
information about him,

36:27.786 --> 36:29.586
you better give it up
right now.

36:29.588 --> 36:31.321
Uh, Barbra.

36:31.323 --> 36:33.890
Uh...

36:33.892 --> 36:34.891
No, I don't think so.

36:34.893 --> 36:37.327
You don't think so?

36:37.329 --> 36:39.196
I don't have
any information.

36:39.198 --> 36:42.599
-Any phone calls?
-No phone calls.

36:42.601 --> 36:44.301
What's going on
over there?

36:44.303 --> 36:45.936
Looks like
you just had a few guests

36:45.938 --> 36:48.939
over for late brunch.

36:48.941 --> 36:50.440
-Late brunch?
-Yeah.

36:50.442 --> 36:51.708
Why wouldn't you say lunch?

36:51.710 --> 36:52.976
It's 11:45.
You have a late brunch.

36:52.978 --> 36:54.544
That's drifting
dangerously into lunch.

36:54.546 --> 36:56.479
It's not, though.
It's not noon.

36:56.481 --> 36:57.480
Noon and beyond is lunch.

36:57.482 --> 36:58.949
Nope, I don't think--

36:58.951 --> 37:00.650
there's brunchware
on the table.

37:00.652 --> 37:06.690
Well, I am a toy collector,

37:06.692 --> 37:09.859
and I had a little
toy powwow,

37:09.861 --> 37:13.296
and I had a couple of fellow
toy collectors come over.

37:15.533 --> 37:18.235
All right,
you see anything weird,
you give us a call.

37:18.237 --> 37:20.837
And if you run
into your brother,

37:20.839 --> 37:22.739
be careful.
He may be dangerous.

37:22.741 --> 37:25.675
-He's not dangerous.
-I said "may be."

37:25.677 --> 37:27.711
-He left the door open.
-I left it open.

37:27.713 --> 37:29.579
I didn't say
he was dangerous.

37:29.581 --> 37:31.715
-He said "may be."
-"May be dangerous."

37:31.717 --> 37:33.583
He might be dangerous,
he may not be dangerous.

37:33.585 --> 37:36.253
-You never know.
-Yes, sir, sirs.

37:36.255 --> 37:41.725
Officer recum?
Office feltcher.

37:41.727 --> 37:43.426
-Okay.
-All right.

37:43.428 --> 37:44.894
-All right.
-Okay.

37:44.896 --> 37:47.897
-Mm-hmm.
-All right.

37:47.899 --> 37:49.499
Okay.

37:52.570 --> 37:53.937
All right.

38:00.578 --> 38:01.778
Okay.

38:06.784 --> 38:08.385
All right.

38:19.497 --> 38:21.965
All right, you guys
can come out now.

38:21.967 --> 38:23.633
Fuck, man.
What is wrong with you?

38:23.635 --> 38:25.402
Oh, my god,
i thought you were the cops.

38:25.404 --> 38:28.738
No, you maniac.
This is bad, man.
This is bad.

38:28.740 --> 38:31.808
What were they doing here?
Are they looking for us?

38:31.810 --> 38:34.077
Yeah, they were asking
about you.

38:34.079 --> 38:36.313
-What do you think?
-I don't know.

38:36.315 --> 38:39.049
They could have been here
for some other shit.

38:39.051 --> 38:41.051
What?

38:41.053 --> 38:43.953
Shut your mouth,
all right?

38:43.955 --> 38:45.655
I've already lied
to the cops once.

38:45.657 --> 38:47.724
Now, there's not a chance

38:47.726 --> 38:49.326
rose is going to
stand for this.

38:49.328 --> 38:51.361
Oh, there's no way
rose will allow this?

38:51.363 --> 38:53.530
Rose?

38:53.532 --> 38:55.799
That's what we're talking
about right now? Rose?

38:55.801 --> 38:57.434
Are you wearing
a fucking skirt?

38:57.436 --> 38:59.035
Jesus Christ,
are you whipped?

38:59.037 --> 39:00.937
Okay, fine.
Fine, all right?

39:00.939 --> 39:02.472
You guys can't stay.
You got to go.

39:02.474 --> 39:04.007
Real nice.
Kick us out.

39:04.009 --> 39:05.408
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

39:05.410 --> 39:06.710
Well, let me ask
one more favor, brother.

39:06.712 --> 39:08.611
All right, fine.
What?

39:08.613 --> 39:10.847
We've been in this shit
for three days.

39:10.849 --> 39:13.383
I've been eating out
of the L.A. river,

39:13.385 --> 39:16.386
hiding in doghouses,
drainage pipes,

39:16.388 --> 39:17.754
I haven't had
a good meal since--

39:17.756 --> 39:21.558
the lunch you cooked
was fucking so good,

39:21.560 --> 39:23.860
the first real food
I've had in days.

39:23.862 --> 39:28.398
I could use a nap
and a shower, right?

39:28.400 --> 39:30.066
And then a plan.

39:30.068 --> 39:32.702
I need your brain to help me
come up with a plan

39:32.704 --> 39:35.372
to get out of this shit.
An escape plan.

39:35.374 --> 39:36.806
-You're smarter than I am.
-You want a plan?

39:36.808 --> 39:38.708
-Yeah.
-Here's a plan.

39:38.710 --> 39:41.845
You call foxy,
you tell her you have l.P.,

39:41.847 --> 39:43.613
tell he's okay,

39:43.615 --> 39:45.415
and you tell her
to call off the search.

39:45.417 --> 39:47.016
Yeah. "Just call off
the search, foxy."

39:47.018 --> 39:48.718
It's that easy, right?

39:48.720 --> 39:51.087
It sounds nice,
but that's not how it works.

39:51.089 --> 39:53.723
I'm knee deep in this shit.

39:53.725 --> 39:56.860
I need help, brother.
I need your help.

39:58.729 --> 40:00.463
All right.

40:03.000 --> 40:06.002
Take your shower
and take a nap.

40:06.004 --> 40:07.904
And when you get up,

40:07.906 --> 40:09.639
we're going to
go over your options,

40:09.641 --> 40:12.709
and you go home,
get the fuck out.

40:12.711 --> 40:15.044
I'm not going home,
but I'll take a shower.

40:15.046 --> 40:17.447
Let me take my shower.

40:19.183 --> 40:22.619
Come on, l.P.
You can help me make
the pumpkin feta.

40:22.621 --> 40:25.755
Is that the original
soldier boy from 1963?

40:25.757 --> 40:27.690
Yeah, actually, it is.

40:30.728 --> 40:32.061
That is a rare piece.

40:32.063 --> 40:35.598
They only have ten
prototypes in existence.

40:35.600 --> 40:36.933
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

40:36.935 --> 40:39.869
But that bad boy right there
is number one.

40:39.871 --> 40:42.806
-No kidding?
-No-- whoa, whoa, whoa.

40:42.808 --> 40:44.908
We don't touch.
We don't touch.

40:44.910 --> 40:46.209
If you can't touch it,
how do you play with it?

40:46.211 --> 40:47.610
You don't play with it.

40:47.612 --> 40:49.579
You collect it
and you admire it.

40:50.816 --> 40:51.881
You want to see
something really cool?

40:51.883 --> 40:53.216
-Sure.
-All right.

40:53.218 --> 40:54.884
Uncle a., phone.

40:54.886 --> 40:56.453
We'll let the answering
machine get it,

40:56.455 --> 40:57.754
because you're about
to feast your eyes

40:57.756 --> 40:59.589
one something very
few people in the world

40:59.591 --> 41:02.492
have ever seen.
Check this out.

41:11.870 --> 41:16.840
Soldier boy puts the "action"
in "action figure."

41:16.842 --> 41:20.043
Soldier boy is brave.
He fears no enemy,

41:20.045 --> 41:22.612
and kills
the evil orientals.

41:24.883 --> 41:27.016
I'll kill you,
soldier boy.

41:32.623 --> 41:34.123
I'm gonna get you!

41:35.993 --> 41:39.095
Soldier boy's
gonna kill us all!
Run for your lives!

41:52.244 --> 41:54.844
Oh!

42:00.751 --> 42:03.786
This soldier boy
is not just a hero,

42:04.823 --> 42:06.022
he is a man,

42:06.024 --> 42:08.024
an American.

42:08.026 --> 42:11.661
More guts
than your own father.

42:16.133 --> 42:17.934
Pretty cool, huh?

42:17.936 --> 42:19.569
I would say
for the times,

42:19.571 --> 42:23.206
it has some
serious issues.

42:23.208 --> 42:25.141
Well, yeah.

42:25.143 --> 42:29.812
I mean, the whole
"macho American killing
orientals" thing

42:29.814 --> 42:33.182
pretty much is what killed
the whole soldier boy idea,

42:33.184 --> 42:35.184
but levine, the father of
soldier boy,

42:35.186 --> 42:38.021
he was in Korea,
and he was in some
pretty fierce gun battles,

42:38.023 --> 42:39.656
and I think it
twisted him up a bit,

42:39.658 --> 42:41.190
and after
a couple of failures,

42:41.192 --> 42:42.859
he actually
hit the jackpot

42:42.861 --> 42:46.095
with one of the top five
toys of all time,

42:46.097 --> 42:49.799
-the g.I. Joe.
-Now that is cool.

42:53.203 --> 42:54.737
You have one message.

42:54.739 --> 42:56.339
Message one--

42:56.341 --> 42:58.207
hello, Anthony,
it's rose.

42:58.209 --> 43:00.677
Thanks for taking care
of the bills and
the dry cleaning.

43:00.679 --> 43:02.879
-Let's just forget--
-uncle a, there's a man.

43:02.881 --> 43:04.314
-Shh.
-I had a really busy
first part of the day,

43:04.316 --> 43:06.149
so I was unable
to call you back,

43:06.151 --> 43:08.818
but the day slowed
and camilian came in
to surprise me,

43:08.820 --> 43:10.887
so I'm taking the rest
of the day off.

43:10.889 --> 43:13.790
Camilian wants to give me
a free session in exchange
for dinner,

43:13.792 --> 43:16.326
so we should be getting there
a little earlier for dinner

43:16.328 --> 43:19.295
than I thought,
maybe around 7:00?

43:19.297 --> 43:23.967
- Okay, honey.
- See you soon.

43:24.970 --> 43:27.870
Trouble in
the rose garden?

43:31.775 --> 43:33.743
Yeah, you could
say that again.

43:33.745 --> 43:37.347
This camilian guy,
he likes aunt rose?

43:37.349 --> 43:40.183
No, it's not--
i don't think so,
not like that.

43:40.185 --> 43:43.753
No, he's a
homeopathic healer.

43:43.755 --> 43:46.089
You mean like
a witch doctor?

43:46.091 --> 43:48.124
Yeah, kinda like that,
you know?

43:48.126 --> 43:50.960
He's-- but he's not all
wacky and tripped out,

43:50.962 --> 43:52.295
at least not
on the surface.

43:52.297 --> 43:56.265
He's more like a new
generation-type weirdo,

43:56.267 --> 44:02.105
like a Wal-Mart cult leader
under cover or something?

44:02.107 --> 44:03.906
He looks...

44:03.908 --> 44:08.277
More like a math teacher
than, uh, than a healer dude.

44:08.279 --> 44:10.213
-Sounds odd.
-Yeah, well,

44:10.215 --> 44:12.081
he is a bit fruitcake-y,

44:12.083 --> 44:14.784
but, you know, again,
it's pretty well hidden.

44:14.786 --> 44:16.152
I mean, after all,
he did help cure

44:16.154 --> 44:17.887
aunt rose's
thyroid problem,

44:17.889 --> 44:20.023
which made her
completely depressed

44:20.025 --> 44:22.792
and pardon my French,
a bitch.

44:22.794 --> 44:24.661
But the sessions worked.

44:24.663 --> 44:26.229
She was really
sweet to me,

44:26.231 --> 44:29.265
and things were
really nice, for a while.

44:31.268 --> 44:32.435
I mean, it's probably
been six months

44:32.437 --> 44:35.238
since we've been
nice to each other.

44:35.240 --> 44:37.807
What the hell?
Why is she getting
a free session

44:37.809 --> 44:39.175
for the dinner I'm making?

44:39.177 --> 44:40.376
Shouldn't i
get the session?

44:40.378 --> 44:42.211
I'm making
the damn dinner.

44:42.213 --> 44:44.981
Sounds like you've
put a lot of thought
into this.

44:44.983 --> 44:46.783
Yeah, it's too much.

44:46.785 --> 44:48.685
Are you jealous?

44:48.687 --> 44:51.954
No, I'm pissed off,
or over it, maybe.

44:51.956 --> 44:54.123
I don't know.
I feel like a jerk.

44:54.125 --> 44:55.291
It's just--
it's complicated.

44:55.293 --> 44:57.860
Seems very complicated.

44:57.862 --> 45:00.229
Yeah, well, some of his
spiritual philosophies

45:00.231 --> 45:03.266
are a bit odd and rose
is starting to take to them.

45:03.268 --> 45:06.803
And I don't think that I can
subscribe to these ideals.

45:06.805 --> 45:09.272
-She asking you to?
-Not yet.

45:09.274 --> 45:11.307
But things have changed
between us.

45:11.309 --> 45:14.043
-How so?
-Well, she doesn't--

45:15.846 --> 45:19.282
she doesn't call me
the cute names she used
to call me,

45:19.284 --> 45:22.051
and she doesn't
look at me the same.

45:23.954 --> 45:28.091
And every time she brings up
her new outlook on life,

45:28.093 --> 45:29.759
if I have anything
to say about it,

45:29.761 --> 45:31.060
she gets all
bent out of shape,

45:31.062 --> 45:32.829
and I become
the a-hole.

45:35.299 --> 45:36.766
I don't know, if--

45:40.137 --> 45:44.140
if she asks me to join
the camilian daily cult,

45:44.142 --> 45:46.909
it would be over
between us.

45:46.911 --> 45:48.277
I would have to
walk away.

45:48.279 --> 45:50.446
Walk away?

45:50.448 --> 45:52.115
Are you saying
it would be over?

45:52.117 --> 45:54.283
No more aunt rose?

45:54.285 --> 45:56.853
Absolutely.

45:56.855 --> 45:58.154
I couldn't do it.

45:59.223 --> 46:00.823
Do you love her?

46:02.860 --> 46:04.794
Yeah.

46:05.896 --> 46:07.230
I do.

46:08.799 --> 46:10.967
But...

46:10.969 --> 46:14.403
It's gotta be
a two-way street,
you know?

46:14.405 --> 46:17.273
There's a line and I just--
i can't cross it.

46:17.275 --> 46:20.777
Rough.

46:20.779 --> 46:22.445
The rat can only
run the wheel

46:22.447 --> 46:24.247
in motion
for only so long

46:24.249 --> 46:26.783
before it will
die of exhaustion.
Ahem.

46:26.785 --> 46:30.286
Take my mom and dad.
They have no business
being together.

46:30.288 --> 46:33.556
They fight so much,
it's good they separated.

46:33.558 --> 46:35.124
That's cold.

46:35.126 --> 46:37.393
I'm not being cold
but they just don't fit.

46:37.395 --> 46:39.829
Never did.
They make each other stupid.

46:39.831 --> 46:41.364
-Yeah, but--
-at least you know

46:41.366 --> 46:43.432
where the line is
drawn in the sand,

46:43.434 --> 46:45.301
and which side
you stand on,

46:45.303 --> 46:47.537
as long as
you follow your heart.

46:47.539 --> 46:51.107
I've grown sick of
people who say one thing

46:51.109 --> 46:52.875
and then do another.

46:52.877 --> 46:54.243
That's not you, uncle a.

46:54.245 --> 46:57.213
I believe you will do
what's best for you.

47:00.350 --> 47:02.118
I will.

47:05.122 --> 47:07.423
I promise.

47:08.559 --> 47:10.359
A promise it is.

47:35.285 --> 47:37.086
Barbra.
Barbra.

47:37.088 --> 47:39.188
Barbra.

47:39.190 --> 47:40.556
Babs.
Get up!

47:40.558 --> 47:42.458
Barbra.
Babs.

47:42.460 --> 47:44.393
Pops is a very
deep sleeper.

47:44.395 --> 47:46.863
Yeah, always has been.

47:46.865 --> 47:48.598
Barbra.
Get up, Barbra.

47:48.600 --> 47:49.932
Get up, Barbra.

47:49.934 --> 47:52.268
Barbra. Barbra.
Get up, Barbra.

47:52.270 --> 47:54.537
Barbra, come on, buddy.
Get up.

47:54.539 --> 47:55.571
Barbra.
Barbra.

47:55.573 --> 47:58.374
Barbra.
Come on!

47:58.376 --> 48:00.076
She's here!

48:02.413 --> 48:05.548
-It's rose.
-What do we do?

48:05.550 --> 48:07.350
I think it can
be instantaneous.

48:07.352 --> 48:08.985
--Seriously,
for example--

48:08.987 --> 48:10.887
-no, I agree.
-For example,

48:10.889 --> 48:13.189
I spent--
this is lovely, by the way.

48:13.191 --> 48:15.258
- Thank you.
- -I spent the first,

48:15.260 --> 48:18.027
easily the first
25 years of my life

48:18.029 --> 48:21.530
looking up at the moon,
never saw the man.

48:21.532 --> 48:24.600
Never saw the man
and then one day,

48:24.602 --> 48:25.968
there he was.

48:25.970 --> 48:27.236
There he was,
instantaneous.

48:27.238 --> 48:29.071
Anthony!
We're home!

48:40.384 --> 48:42.485
Everything changed for me.
Everything.

48:42.487 --> 48:44.520
The way of looking,
and that's how change can be.

48:44.522 --> 48:46.188
-It can be instantaneous.
-Unbelievable.

48:46.190 --> 48:48.257
But I think-- I think
seeing the man in the moon

48:48.259 --> 48:49.392
kind of ruined
the moon for me--

48:49.394 --> 48:50.526
-oh.
-Oh, hey,
there you are.

48:50.528 --> 48:52.061
Hey!

48:52.063 --> 48:54.330
Hey, brother.
Get over here!

48:54.332 --> 48:56.532
Oh, we don't shake!

48:56.534 --> 49:01.070
Shaking's what you do
when you're in the depths
of fear.

49:01.072 --> 49:03.439
Oh, it feels good
to be in your presence.

49:03.441 --> 49:04.573
You have some good energy
this evening.

49:07.145 --> 49:08.210
Mmm.

49:10.113 --> 49:12.415
-All right.
-So, is dinner ready?

49:12.417 --> 49:17.720
Oh, I have been hearing about
this white gazpacho soup.

49:17.722 --> 49:19.555
-Uh, no.
-No?

49:19.557 --> 49:22.024
But you left
a couple messages
saying you'd started it.

49:22.026 --> 49:23.459
Yeah.

49:23.461 --> 49:26.662
I had a really busy day.
I had a lot of yesses.

49:26.664 --> 49:28.030
Oh, really?
Wow.

49:28.032 --> 49:29.398
That's surprising.

49:29.400 --> 49:31.434
Well, that sounds good.
Why is that surprising?

49:31.436 --> 49:33.502
What are you putting
your energy into, brother?

49:33.504 --> 49:36.105
Uh, it's a temp job.

49:36.107 --> 49:37.373
A temporary job
is a job.

49:37.375 --> 49:40.443
A job is a connector
to your dreams.

49:40.445 --> 49:44.380
And if you can put some of that
back into the community,

49:44.382 --> 49:46.582
back into the society,
i mean, that's--

49:46.584 --> 49:51.287
that's good for the process.
That's good for your
karmic purposes.

49:51.289 --> 49:57.126
Yeah, I sell burial insurance,
for-- uh, over the phone.

49:57.128 --> 50:01.530
Wow.
Uh...

50:01.532 --> 50:03.299
Hmm.

50:03.301 --> 50:05.735
So you want to
get dinner started?
We're starving.

50:05.737 --> 50:07.370
Who wants a glass
of red?

50:07.372 --> 50:09.538
-I would like
a glass of red.
- Me, me.

50:09.540 --> 50:11.207
Me too.

51:08.665 --> 51:10.833
Shh!

51:26.216 --> 51:29.718
-Oh, my universe.
-Oh wow.

51:29.720 --> 51:32.388
Oh!
Oh, my.

51:32.390 --> 51:35.491
Oh, this looks and
smells of love!

51:36.527 --> 51:38.561
-Oh, my.
-Thanks, cam.

51:38.563 --> 51:41.630
Nicely--
camilian.

51:42.666 --> 51:46.235
-I'm sorry?
-My name! It--

51:46.237 --> 51:49.371
my name.
I go by my birth star name.

51:49.373 --> 51:52.241
It's camilian.

51:54.377 --> 51:55.711
Never "cam."

51:57.814 --> 52:00.483
I'm sorry.

52:00.485 --> 52:01.517
I didn't mean
to offend you.

52:01.519 --> 52:03.185
No, no, no, no.
It's okay.

52:03.187 --> 52:05.454
You were coming from,
you know, a healthy place

52:05.456 --> 52:08.257
and I know you didn't
mean any harm by it,

52:08.259 --> 52:09.592
but, um...

52:09.594 --> 52:12.461
You know, you and I,

52:12.463 --> 52:14.897
we are from
the same tribe, brother.

52:17.334 --> 52:20.569
Mmm.
Oh, wow.

52:20.571 --> 52:22.605
Well, you know,
if you keep cooking
like this

52:22.607 --> 52:25.374
and inviting me
i may have to change
my name policy.

52:25.376 --> 52:28.177
Let you call me
whatever you want.

52:28.179 --> 52:29.712
Just don't call me
late for dinner.

52:32.749 --> 52:35.251
It's really good.

52:35.253 --> 52:36.318
Thank you.

52:36.320 --> 52:37.653
Mmm.
Mmm!

52:37.655 --> 52:39.388
It's better than breakfast.

52:48.498 --> 52:51.233
How's the thyroid therapy
sessions going?

52:51.235 --> 52:54.670
You've been at it
for quite a while now.

52:54.672 --> 52:58.641
Oh, well, I think
thyroid issue's behind us.

52:58.643 --> 53:00.543
Really?

53:00.545 --> 53:02.678
I did not know that.

53:02.680 --> 53:04.446
I told you that
like two weeks ago.

53:04.448 --> 53:06.315
Yeah, but I thought maybe
you weren't totally healed,

53:06.317 --> 53:09.351
because you kept
the sessions going.

53:09.353 --> 53:11.220
Hmm.
Well, what we did was

53:11.222 --> 53:13.389
we removed the negative
energy from the thyroid

53:13.391 --> 53:15.424
and then we discovered
new blockages while
we were there

53:15.426 --> 53:17.960
that were blocking
what we discovered to be

53:17.962 --> 53:23.199
actually the origin
of the thyroid issue.

53:23.201 --> 53:25.768
What it was blocking.

53:25.770 --> 53:28.837
Oh, what kind of
blockages are you
uncovering?

53:28.839 --> 53:32.474
Oh, I can't talk about it.

53:32.476 --> 53:33.876
No, we can't--
we can't talk about it.

53:33.878 --> 53:35.744
I mean, it's just too
early in the process.

53:35.746 --> 53:37.746
It's like--
we need to--

53:37.748 --> 53:41.517
you know, nurture
and keep safe and

53:41.519 --> 53:43.519
just keep the negative
energy out until it's--

53:43.521 --> 53:46.622
till we're at the right
stage of the process in
the healing process.

53:46.624 --> 53:49.758
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I understand,
i understand.

53:49.760 --> 53:51.994
I just didn't want to be
the cause of a blockage.

53:51.996 --> 53:54.530
No.
No.

53:54.532 --> 53:55.798
No.

53:55.800 --> 53:57.733
No.

53:57.735 --> 53:59.368
It's nothing
like that.

53:59.370 --> 54:00.970
No, nothing.

54:00.972 --> 54:03.472
I was joking.

54:03.474 --> 54:04.673
Yeah, I didn't mean--

54:04.675 --> 54:07.576
-yeah.
-Hmm.

54:07.578 --> 54:09.878
Rose tells me you--

54:09.880 --> 54:11.647
you collect dolls.

54:16.586 --> 54:19.455
I collect vintage toys.

54:19.457 --> 54:21.624
Some of them
are dolls, yeah.

54:21.626 --> 54:23.359
That's cool.
Hey,

54:23.361 --> 54:25.494
way to stay young,
you know?

54:25.496 --> 54:28.330
To pretend and
live in fantasy,

54:28.332 --> 54:29.999
I mean, that's--

54:30.001 --> 54:34.670
I wish I had more time
for that sort of activity.

54:34.672 --> 54:37.039
So you use some kind of sound
machine you made up,

54:37.041 --> 54:39.675
or you made it?

54:39.677 --> 54:42.745
Correct, on both counts.

54:42.747 --> 54:44.880
I am the inventor

54:44.882 --> 54:46.782
of the daily chakraphone

54:46.784 --> 54:49.051
and it is named after me,
but I encourage you

54:49.053 --> 54:51.053
to get your daily dose

54:51.055 --> 54:52.855
of the daily chakraphone.

54:52.857 --> 54:55.624
It feels so amazing
after a session.

54:55.626 --> 54:57.293
You should
really try it.

54:57.295 --> 54:59.395
I've been wanting him
to try a session.

54:59.397 --> 55:01.730
I mean, it could help you
with quitting smoking or--

55:01.732 --> 55:02.965
you know what
we should do?

55:02.967 --> 55:05.334
I should do some
clairvoyant teachings

55:05.336 --> 55:09.672
for his-- what is it,
when he hunts for toys?

55:09.674 --> 55:11.307
That would be a good
application, right?

55:11.309 --> 55:13.776
Why don't you come in
for a sesh?

55:13.778 --> 55:15.644
What does it do, actually?

55:16.780 --> 55:19.581
Well, I mean,
just basically...

55:19.583 --> 55:21.650
- May I?
- Mm-hmm.

55:21.652 --> 55:25.554
So, um, picture a tuning fork
after it's been struck.

55:25.556 --> 55:27.890
--So it vibrates.

55:29.727 --> 55:32.094
Makes a sound,
a tone.

55:33.563 --> 55:35.597
Now the daily chakraphone

55:35.599 --> 55:38.000
vibrates at frequencies

55:38.002 --> 55:41.337
that speak directly

55:41.339 --> 55:42.905
to the frequencies

55:42.907 --> 55:46.442
of the human being's DNA.

55:47.944 --> 55:48.977
Wow.

55:48.979 --> 55:49.978
-Yeah.
-That just--

55:49.980 --> 55:52.648
it sounds fantastic.

55:52.650 --> 55:53.982
Well, that's actually
not very crazy.

55:53.984 --> 55:55.584
I mean, the science
is all right there.

55:55.586 --> 55:57.786
It's just a matter
of knowing where to look,

55:57.788 --> 56:01.623
knowing where to dial in
for the specific illness,
you know.

56:01.625 --> 56:02.858
Whatever it might be,

56:02.860 --> 56:06.462
mental, spiritual,
physical.

56:06.464 --> 56:08.964
My industry has, you know,
modernized with computers

56:08.966 --> 56:12.134
and a lot, you know.

56:12.136 --> 56:14.870
But, um...

56:14.872 --> 56:21.577
I am currently developing
a chakraphone phone app

56:21.579 --> 56:23.045
as we speak.

56:23.047 --> 56:26.915
You just feel
so much clarity.

56:26.917 --> 56:28.951
-Thank you.
-Well, that's cool.

56:28.953 --> 56:31.687
I mean, that's very cool.

56:31.689 --> 56:34.957
You know, I'm just a kind of
a hands-on type of guy.

56:34.959 --> 56:37.793
You know, like, I need
to see it to believe it.

56:47.071 --> 56:49.104
No, it's fine.

56:49.106 --> 56:52.775
Do you want to do
a session?

56:52.777 --> 56:53.976
Yeah.

56:53.978 --> 56:56.011
Do a session on him,
just by himself?

56:56.013 --> 56:59.481
-Yeah.
-I have
the chakraphone.

56:59.483 --> 57:02.084
You both should do
the convention together.

57:03.686 --> 57:06.088
Wow, thank you.

57:06.090 --> 57:08.190
Oh, wow.

57:11.828 --> 57:14.897
Yeah, I guess,
I'm just, uh,

57:14.899 --> 57:17.433
just a bit of a skeptic,
that's it.

57:17.435 --> 57:19.067
Yeah.

57:19.069 --> 57:21.570
Yeah, I was too.

57:21.572 --> 57:25.641
Wow, I was
just like you.

57:26.910 --> 57:29.578
Yeah, you know,

57:29.580 --> 57:33.115
you remind me of me.

57:33.117 --> 57:37.786
So we're having this thing
that I do annually,

57:37.788 --> 57:40.055
and it's happening
next weekend,

57:40.057 --> 57:42.090
and it's actually
our anniversary.

57:42.092 --> 57:43.926
It's a 10-year-anniversary
and as you know,

57:43.928 --> 57:46.528
I've asked rose
to help me out with
the demonstrations

57:46.530 --> 57:49.064
and maybe even some
logistical work, right?

57:49.066 --> 57:50.632
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

57:50.634 --> 57:52.968
And we were wondering--
well, I was wondering--

57:52.970 --> 57:55.704
if you would like
to join us.

57:57.140 --> 57:59.641
Actually, it's the first time
I'm hearing about it.

57:59.643 --> 58:01.009
I just--
i didn't mention it

58:01.011 --> 58:02.878
'cause I didn't think
you'd be interested.

58:02.880 --> 58:05.681
Well, how could I have
an interest if you
didn't tell me?

58:05.683 --> 58:08.050
So, I'm glad
you're interested.

58:08.052 --> 58:10.219
Oh, ye of little faith!

58:10.221 --> 58:13.222
Okay, this--
this is really--

58:13.224 --> 58:15.757
it's really--
it's truly a great event.

58:15.759 --> 58:18.126
We have healers,
all sorts of healers,

58:18.128 --> 58:21.630
and all sorts of
natural medicines and

58:21.632 --> 58:23.732
methods and
i mean clinics

58:23.734 --> 58:25.601
for any sort of problem
that you might have.

58:25.603 --> 58:28.036
I mean, we've scoured
the whole country

58:28.038 --> 58:29.638
and we've got the best.

58:29.640 --> 58:32.140
It's a 10-day retreat
with the best.

58:32.142 --> 58:33.675
Excuse me for a minute?

58:33.677 --> 58:35.210
Oh, mm-hmm.

58:36.546 --> 58:38.180
You know what I think.

58:38.182 --> 58:40.782
I think this would just
be a great opportunity

58:40.784 --> 58:43.118
for you to
open yourself up

58:43.120 --> 58:46.121
and you wanted to look
and see for yourself.

58:46.123 --> 58:49.725
You know,
if you're interested.

58:49.727 --> 58:52.528
I'm not saying
I'm interested.

58:52.530 --> 58:54.963
But I'm not saying
I'm not interested.

58:54.965 --> 58:56.932
What I said was,

58:56.934 --> 59:00.669
how could I be interested

59:00.671 --> 59:02.004
if you never
brought it up?

59:02.006 --> 59:03.572
See?
You're not interested.

59:03.574 --> 59:05.574
No, that's not
what I'm saying.

59:05.576 --> 59:07.843
I just need a little bit
more information

59:07.845 --> 59:09.244
before I jump off
that bridge.

59:09.246 --> 59:11.680
- Okay.

59:14.884 --> 59:16.952
Yeah, I'll get it.
I'll get it.

59:19.989 --> 59:21.623
Aw, shit.

59:21.625 --> 59:22.925
Who is it?

59:23.993 --> 59:25.928
Uh...

59:25.930 --> 59:27.829
It's foxy.

59:31.067 --> 59:32.868
Hi, foxy.

59:32.870 --> 59:35.704
Where's your
motherfucking brother
and my child?

59:35.706 --> 59:37.339
What are you talking about?
I haven't seen them.
If I told you--

59:37.341 --> 59:40.609
damn liar.
I can tell, boy.
Don't play with me.

59:40.611 --> 59:42.744
I swear to god,
i have not seen them.

59:42.746 --> 59:45.814
If I heard from them,
i would tell you immed--
ah, shit.

59:45.816 --> 59:48.283
-Baby!
-Mama!

59:51.187 --> 59:52.654
Hey, hey, hey.
No fighting in front of--

59:52.656 --> 59:54.289
shut your ass up, liar!

59:54.291 --> 59:56.692
-Okay, everybody
stop it.
-Stop it.

59:56.694 --> 59:57.960
-Liar. Shut up.
-Stop it.

59:57.962 --> 01:00:00.796
Stop it.

01:00:00.798 --> 01:00:02.297
What is going on?

01:00:02.299 --> 01:00:05.300
Don't you people watch
the news around here? Damn!

01:00:05.302 --> 01:00:06.902
Barbra kidnapped l.P.

01:00:06.904 --> 01:00:08.236
Okay, let's just
all sit down

01:00:08.238 --> 01:00:10.138
and talk this through
like adults.

01:00:11.374 --> 01:00:13.041
Sit down.

01:00:22.385 --> 01:00:24.920
I don't mean to intrude,

01:00:24.922 --> 01:00:28.123
but perhaps I can be
of some help

01:00:28.125 --> 01:00:32.361
if you need
a neutral mediator.

01:00:32.363 --> 01:00:33.962
My name is
camilian daily

01:00:33.964 --> 01:00:37.199
and I do energy healing.

01:00:37.201 --> 01:00:40.202
-Oh.
-For problematic
crisis resolution.

01:00:40.204 --> 01:00:41.937
You're the witch
doctor friend?

01:00:43.207 --> 01:00:44.740
Shut your ass up.
Nobody asked you

01:00:44.742 --> 01:00:46.208
if you thought
it was funny.

01:00:46.210 --> 01:00:50.912
-Shut up.
-It is holistic healing.

01:00:50.914 --> 01:00:52.347
Camilian's who helped me
with my thyroid.

01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:54.650
No shit.
Oh yeah?

01:00:54.652 --> 01:00:55.984
I could use some work.

01:00:55.986 --> 01:00:57.686
My chi has been off
like a motherfucker,

01:00:57.688 --> 01:00:58.820
you know what I'm saying?

01:00:58.822 --> 01:01:00.922
You do tarot cards?

01:01:00.924 --> 01:01:02.691
Hmm, I don't
really do tarot--

01:01:02.693 --> 01:01:04.092
hey.

01:01:07.363 --> 01:01:08.797
Where's l.P.?

01:01:10.733 --> 01:01:13.368
My baby!

01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:15.137
I didn't do it
this time.

01:01:22.145 --> 01:01:24.713
Put it on speaker.

01:01:24.715 --> 01:01:26.715
It's me, l.P.
I'm okay.

01:01:26.717 --> 01:01:28.183
Cut the shit,
you snot nose.

01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:29.851
Hey, this is snake.

01:01:29.853 --> 01:01:32.154
If you want to see--
what do they call you, kid?

01:01:32.156 --> 01:01:33.922
-L.P.
-L.P.?

01:01:33.924 --> 01:01:37.059
- Yeah.
- -Like the vinyl?

01:01:37.061 --> 01:01:39.327
What's that stand for?

01:01:39.329 --> 01:01:42.297
Listen, this is snake.
If you ever want to see
d.P. Again--

01:01:42.299 --> 01:01:44.733
no, l.P.!

01:01:44.735 --> 01:01:46.334
If you want to see
the kid again,

01:01:46.336 --> 01:01:49.237
l.P. Again, then you gotta
swap me for soldier boy

01:01:49.239 --> 01:01:52.107
or else you, his mom,
and his papa-San

01:01:52.109 --> 01:01:53.241
will never see
the kid again.

01:01:53.243 --> 01:01:54.443
I know what's
going on, man.

01:01:54.445 --> 01:01:56.011
You don't think
i don't watch the news?

01:01:56.013 --> 01:01:58.046
Word on the street is
you snatched the kid up.

01:01:58.048 --> 01:02:00.115
You go straight to
the pokey for that, man,

01:02:00.117 --> 01:02:02.050
and then from there
to the chair.

01:02:02.052 --> 01:02:03.785
So here's the deal, fucko.

01:02:03.787 --> 01:02:06.154
You give me soldier boy
and everything's copacetic.

01:02:06.156 --> 01:02:09.124
Then you can go back
to your copacetic,
cushy little life

01:02:09.126 --> 01:02:10.492
with ol' mama Hitler.

01:02:15.231 --> 01:02:16.431
Snake!

01:02:18.334 --> 01:02:19.434
-Call the police.
-Yes!

01:02:19.436 --> 01:02:21.236
No, wait.

01:02:21.238 --> 01:02:22.337
You're not gonna call
the cops on me, are you?

01:02:22.339 --> 01:02:23.872
Shut your ass up.

01:02:23.874 --> 01:02:25.240
I'll say how to deal
with your ass later.

01:02:25.242 --> 01:02:26.908
-Okay. Call 'em.
-Is he all right?

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:27.909
-Babs.
-Yes!

01:02:27.911 --> 01:02:29.311
-Get some rope.
-Rope!

01:02:29.313 --> 01:02:31.079
-You gonna tie him up?
-Yeah, if he wakes up

01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:32.380
before the police get here,
he's gonna be mad as hell.

01:02:32.382 --> 01:02:33.815
Guess you'd better
tie him up tight, then.

01:02:33.817 --> 01:02:35.317
Operator,
i need the police.

01:02:35.319 --> 01:02:38.820
And then I suggest we
do a relaxation exercise

01:02:38.822 --> 01:02:40.889
to reset the energy
in the room.

01:02:50.066 --> 01:02:52.400
I want my soldier boy
back, you son of a bitch.

01:02:52.402 --> 01:02:54.402
Keep quiet,
you baby snatcher.

01:02:54.404 --> 01:02:56.438
Why don't you go outside
and clear your name with
the news reporters?

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:58.006
They still
think it was you.

01:02:58.008 --> 01:02:59.474
Hell, I thought it was
you the whole time.

01:02:59.476 --> 01:03:01.343
Part of me
still thinks it's you.

01:03:01.345 --> 01:03:03.278
Yeah, well,
i didn't do it, so...

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:05.413
You get them back
in their warrior, okay.

01:03:05.415 --> 01:03:07.449
You get them to reclaim
their warrior.

01:03:07.451 --> 01:03:10.085
Justice was served,
this time.

01:03:10.087 --> 01:03:11.820
-You guys are lucky.
-Yeah, don't go running around

01:03:11.822 --> 01:03:13.255
trying to be heroes,
doing our jobs for us.

01:03:13.257 --> 01:03:15.257
That's what
this badge is for.

01:03:15.259 --> 01:03:17.092
You got it.
Thank you, officers.

01:03:17.094 --> 01:03:18.326
All right, let's take him
downtown and book him.

01:03:18.328 --> 01:03:19.928
Well, the precinct's
in midtown.

01:03:19.930 --> 01:03:21.463
Yeah, but you gotta
go through downtown--

01:03:21.465 --> 01:03:23.231
but don't say "downtown"
when you mean--

01:03:23.233 --> 01:03:25.033
-it's easier-- people know--
-just get him outta here!

01:03:26.869 --> 01:03:28.403
Good night, officers.

01:03:31.274 --> 01:03:33.108
Oh.

01:03:33.110 --> 01:03:36.344
Is everything, uh...
Worked out?

01:03:36.346 --> 01:03:38.079
Yeah, the press is
starting to leave now.

01:03:38.081 --> 01:03:40.182
Okay.

01:03:40.184 --> 01:03:41.950
Well, why don't you
both join us?

01:03:41.952 --> 01:03:45.020
Barbra,
foxy and rose and I

01:03:45.022 --> 01:03:48.089
we've been having some
soul-searching discussion

01:03:48.091 --> 01:03:50.592
and we've got a couple
of positive ideas

01:03:50.594 --> 01:03:52.861
that we'd like
to run by you.

01:03:52.863 --> 01:03:55.497
Barbra, sit.
Sit, Barbra, sit.
Sit.

01:03:55.499 --> 01:03:57.833
Sit, Barbra.

01:03:57.835 --> 01:04:00.101
I know you don't
know me from Adam,

01:04:00.103 --> 01:04:01.937
and I may come off
as a little strange,

01:04:01.939 --> 01:04:04.606
but I want to help.

01:04:06.209 --> 01:04:07.342
I've done a lot of
family healing,

01:04:07.344 --> 01:04:09.311
so, Anthony, please.

01:04:09.313 --> 01:04:11.980
Why don't you
have a seat?

01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:16.051
You're a part
of this family, too.

01:04:16.053 --> 01:04:17.485
We need your help.

01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:23.158
All right,
anything to help.

01:04:25.228 --> 01:04:27.095
All right.

01:04:29.966 --> 01:04:32.634
So rose and foxy and I

01:04:32.636 --> 01:04:36.404
have been doing
a little thinking,

01:04:36.406 --> 01:04:38.106
doing a little
soul searching,

01:04:38.108 --> 01:04:40.408
and we've been talking about
Sonic spirit convention

01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:43.044
my award-winning workshop,

01:04:43.046 --> 01:04:46.081
in addition to some other
details about my past

01:04:46.083 --> 01:04:48.216
and relationship healing.

01:04:48.218 --> 01:04:50.886
And um...

01:04:50.888 --> 01:04:53.088
Well...

01:04:53.090 --> 01:04:55.523
Gentlemen...

01:04:55.525 --> 01:04:58.960
I have a gift.

01:04:58.962 --> 01:05:02.530
And frankly,
i was a little scared

01:05:02.532 --> 01:05:04.366
when I discovered it
as a child,

01:05:06.335 --> 01:05:11.172
but I have learned
that is my mission...

01:05:13.342 --> 01:05:16.177
To help others
in relationships.

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:19.514
Barbra, you know,

01:05:19.516 --> 01:05:21.983
you are--

01:05:21.985 --> 01:05:25.987
you must forgive me here--

01:05:25.989 --> 01:05:30.926
you love your foxy
but you are a...
A wild animal

01:05:30.928 --> 01:05:32.294
that needs to be tamed.

01:05:34.031 --> 01:05:35.563
Wild animal!

01:05:38.567 --> 01:05:41.436
Is it simple
to be simple?

01:05:46.242 --> 01:05:48.710
And you, Anthony.

01:05:48.712 --> 01:05:53.949
You're the kind of guy
that needs to see it
to believe it.

01:05:53.951 --> 01:05:58.620
You need some real world,
hands-on experience.

01:05:58.622 --> 01:06:01.389
I applaud you for that.
You're a thinker.

01:06:01.391 --> 01:06:04.025
You're not one of these guys
that's a clown,

01:06:04.027 --> 01:06:06.294
that's just going
to be a lemming and
jump off the bridge,

01:06:06.296 --> 01:06:09.130
as you put it, right?

01:06:09.132 --> 01:06:12.400
No, I respect that.

01:06:12.402 --> 01:06:16.204
So without any further ado,
let's sit back, relax,

01:06:16.206 --> 01:06:19.474
and witness
the healing power

01:06:19.476 --> 01:06:21.276
of the daily chakraphone.

01:06:22.211 --> 01:06:24.546
Is that a walkman?

01:06:24.548 --> 01:06:27.449
Wait, just... wait.

01:06:27.451 --> 01:06:31.686
We'll get to that,
i promise, all right?

01:06:31.688 --> 01:06:33.221
It's party time.

01:06:33.223 --> 01:06:34.289
Wait, what's going on?

01:06:34.291 --> 01:06:35.523
What is this guy doing?

01:06:35.525 --> 01:06:37.158
Keep that damn mouth
of yours shut

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:39.260
if you want me
and your son back.

01:06:39.262 --> 01:06:41.029
Dumb fucking cracker-ass.

01:06:41.031 --> 01:06:43.231
I think what
your loving foxy

01:06:43.233 --> 01:06:45.533
is--quite
passionately as well--

01:06:45.535 --> 01:06:50.305
trying to give you
is a, uh,

01:06:50.307 --> 01:06:53.108
what we call
an ultimatum.

01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:54.576
What?

01:06:54.578 --> 01:06:56.478
A ultimatum.

01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:58.646
Two choices.

01:06:58.648 --> 01:07:04.386
One, you go to
the Sonic spirit convention
with foxy,

01:07:04.388 --> 01:07:08.223
and you work on your
relationship and you heal it,

01:07:08.225 --> 01:07:13.528
or two, you don't
go to the super Sonic
spirit convention

01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:16.031
and instead,
you get a divorce.

01:07:16.033 --> 01:07:21.336
And, uh, you get
a custody battle
over your son.

01:07:21.338 --> 01:07:24.472
See what I'm trying
to bring you? Peace.

01:07:24.474 --> 01:07:26.241
Peace.

01:07:31.414 --> 01:07:33.481
Okay?
Anyhow,

01:07:33.483 --> 01:07:36.684
what I need you to do is
i need you to work, okay?

01:07:36.686 --> 01:07:39.287
It's not gonna be easy.
I mean, I can help you.

01:07:39.289 --> 01:07:40.688
There's a way that
we can do this.

01:07:40.690 --> 01:07:42.190
It's not gonna be easy
but I'm here to help.

01:07:42.192 --> 01:07:43.725
But you are gonna
have to put in the work.

01:07:43.727 --> 01:07:45.460
And you are gonna
have to be willing,

01:07:45.462 --> 01:07:50.165
and you are gonna have
to want it really bad.

01:07:50.167 --> 01:07:51.199
All right?

01:07:51.201 --> 01:07:52.467
Yeah.

01:07:52.469 --> 01:07:55.336
So, let's begin.

01:07:55.338 --> 01:07:58.273
First of all,
I'm gonna ask you a question.

01:07:58.275 --> 01:08:00.542
Now the question
is a question

01:08:00.544 --> 01:08:02.677
I don't want you
to answer just yet, okay?

01:08:02.679 --> 01:08:04.679
The question is--

01:08:04.681 --> 01:08:07.682
well, I guess you need
to hear the question first.

01:08:07.684 --> 01:08:09.250
The question is
are you going

01:08:09.252 --> 01:08:11.152
to the Sonic spirit
convention with foxy

01:08:11.154 --> 01:08:12.620
to work on
your relationship?

01:08:12.622 --> 01:08:14.689
All right, don't answer.
Don't answer that question

01:08:14.691 --> 01:08:16.658
till after you've been
daily chakraphoned.

01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:18.393
We're gonna take
ten deep breaths,

01:08:18.395 --> 01:08:19.694
we're gonna take
that question,

01:08:19.696 --> 01:08:21.496
we're gonna put it
into a crystal ball.

01:08:21.497 --> 01:08:24.832
We're gonna focus on it
after we close our eyes.

01:08:24.835 --> 01:08:27.102
Okay, we'll do
this step by step.

01:08:27.104 --> 01:08:28.336
I'll lead you
through this, okay?

01:08:28.337 --> 01:08:31.272
All right,
here we go.

01:08:31.274 --> 01:08:33.841
So, ten deep breaths,
like this.

01:08:37.714 --> 01:08:39.581
No four, five,
let me do it.

01:08:39.582 --> 01:08:40.881
Five.

01:08:40.884 --> 01:08:42.383
Six.

01:08:42.385 --> 01:08:43.852
Seven-- not yet.

01:08:43.854 --> 01:08:44.886
Eight.

01:08:44.888 --> 01:08:46.354
Nine.

01:08:46.356 --> 01:08:48.622
Ten.

01:08:48.625 --> 01:08:52.560
Okay, now--
now you, okay?

01:08:52.562 --> 01:08:54.595
--May I touch you?

01:08:54.598 --> 01:08:55.897
Yeah.

01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:09.810
Okay, that's good.
Let it out, let it out.

01:09:09.813 --> 01:09:11.645
All right.

01:09:11.648 --> 01:09:15.149
Now we're gonna
take that question
and put it

01:09:15.152 --> 01:09:16.783
into a crystal ball,

01:09:16.786 --> 01:09:19.520
and focus on
that question,

01:09:19.523 --> 01:09:22.657
and we're gonna gently
close our eyes, okay?

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:25.160
Gently.
Gently close our eyes.

01:09:25.162 --> 01:09:28.328
All right, we're gonna
face these people, and--

01:09:31.234 --> 01:09:33.734
so now...

01:09:33.737 --> 01:09:36.371
Once we're relaxed--

01:09:36.372 --> 01:09:39.741
once we're relaxed,
we're going to start

01:09:39.743 --> 01:09:42.277
the daily chakraphone.

01:09:43.546 --> 01:09:46.413
We're going to start
the daily chakraphone.

01:09:50.719 --> 01:09:53.787
Okay, so, what happens...

01:09:53.790 --> 01:09:59.194
What sometimes happens
during the experience is...

01:09:59.196 --> 01:10:02.363
I've never had anyone
ask for a refund, or--

01:10:02.365 --> 01:10:03.898
never had any complaint
of failure,

01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:07.268
but sometimes what will
happen is there's a--

01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:10.471
when the outcome is not
a union but a reunion of sorts
with the self,

01:10:10.473 --> 01:10:12.774
if that's where
the energy needed to go,

01:10:12.776 --> 01:10:16.578
so in this case if there
is some misguided love
within Barbra,

01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:19.480
the daily chakraphone
will find it
and correct it.

01:10:19.482 --> 01:10:21.482
All right, so, also
we have to keep in mind

01:10:21.484 --> 01:10:23.318
that this is just
one part of the process.

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:25.853
This is just one
of a long process

01:10:25.855 --> 01:10:29.624
that will continue during
the spirit Sonic convention,
okay?

01:10:29.626 --> 01:10:31.226
So...

01:10:31.228 --> 01:10:33.528
Wow. Okay.

01:10:40.437 --> 01:10:43.805
- Okay, okay, breathe.

01:10:43.807 --> 01:10:44.739
Shit.

01:10:44.741 --> 01:10:46.474
Breathe.

01:10:46.476 --> 01:10:50.411
I want you to just...
Breathe.

01:10:50.413 --> 01:10:51.579
Oh, my god.

01:10:53.515 --> 01:10:54.882
How are you?

01:10:54.884 --> 01:10:57.552
Good.

01:10:59.722 --> 01:11:01.656
I feel good!

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:04.759
Oh, wow, that's great.

01:11:04.761 --> 01:11:07.295
-Ha!
-That's good.

01:11:07.297 --> 01:11:10.331
- Relaxed!
- -Oh, relaxed.

01:11:10.333 --> 01:11:14.369
-Relaxed is good.
-Oh!

01:11:14.371 --> 01:11:16.971
That's really good.
Wow, you're very warm.

01:11:19.476 --> 01:11:21.776
I'm a professional.
I've done this many times.

01:11:21.778 --> 01:11:24.646
And you're safe.
You're in good company.

01:11:24.648 --> 01:11:27.448
This is so good.
This is really, really good.

01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:30.385
Ladies and gentlemen,
can we-- can we please

01:11:30.387 --> 01:11:32.854
give Barbra a hand?

01:11:32.856 --> 01:11:35.657
- All right, yeah!

01:11:37.393 --> 01:11:40.862
Oh, my goodness,
my goodness.

01:11:42.665 --> 01:11:43.831
Oh, wow.

01:11:43.833 --> 01:11:45.967
That was really
something.

01:11:45.969 --> 01:11:48.603
Okay, give me another
deep breath, just--

01:11:48.605 --> 01:11:51.005
just to--

01:11:51.007 --> 01:11:55.610
great, now,
do you remember
the question?

01:11:55.612 --> 01:11:57.945
You can keep your eyes
closed for this.

01:11:57.947 --> 01:11:59.714
-I do.
-You remember
the question.

01:11:59.716 --> 01:12:04.485
And do you remember putting it
in the crystal ball?

01:12:04.487 --> 01:12:06.854
Oh, yes.
Glorious.

01:12:06.856 --> 01:12:10.591
Do you remember...
The color?

01:12:10.593 --> 01:12:13.561
- I do, I do.
- -Do you see the color?

01:12:13.563 --> 01:12:19.400
What is the color
of that crystal ball?

01:12:19.402 --> 01:12:22.937
-Do you remember
the color...
-Yeah.

01:12:22.939 --> 01:12:24.872
Of the crystal ball?

01:12:24.874 --> 01:12:26.974
-Blue!
-Oh!

01:12:28.812 --> 01:12:31.546
-Like the sky!
-Oh, ho, ho!

01:12:31.548 --> 01:12:33.915
Oh, I can see it!

01:12:33.917 --> 01:12:36.951
-Bright blue!
-Oh, bright blue!

01:12:36.953 --> 01:12:38.720
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, you guys are gonna have

01:12:38.722 --> 01:12:40.955
so much fun when you go.
Oh, my gosh.

01:12:40.957 --> 01:12:43.558
You're gonna have
so many new leaders
and so much energy

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:45.960
and so much burning
with fire and energy.

01:12:45.962 --> 01:12:48.062
Now I want you
to take the workshop.

01:12:48.064 --> 01:12:49.697
The workshop
i want you to take,

01:12:49.699 --> 01:12:52.367
a past life regression
correctional boot camp

01:12:52.369 --> 01:12:56.404
relationship
couples in crisis
workshop, okay?

01:12:56.406 --> 01:13:00.675
We go back in past life,
and then we go forward,
you know,

01:13:00.677 --> 01:13:02.910
it's past,
present and future.
We're cleansing all of that.

01:13:02.912 --> 01:13:05.513
'Cause that--
it repeats, you know.

01:13:05.515 --> 01:13:08.149
I'm so happy for you.
It takes a lot of courage.

01:13:08.151 --> 01:13:11.085
This is bullshit.

01:13:12.788 --> 01:13:15.423
-You're being rude.
-No, this is a cheap trick.

01:13:15.425 --> 01:13:17.859
Hey, Anthony.
Uh uh.

01:13:17.861 --> 01:13:19.060
Leave cam alone.

01:13:19.062 --> 01:13:21.162
No, no, that's--

01:13:21.164 --> 01:13:23.564
it's okay,
i can take it.

01:13:25.634 --> 01:13:27.902
I have no judgments.

01:13:27.904 --> 01:13:31.139
But I can see that

01:13:31.141 --> 01:13:34.142
that is not
a two-way street,

01:13:34.144 --> 01:13:36.177
is it, Anthony?

01:13:36.179 --> 01:13:41.582
Anthony has got it
all figured out,

01:13:41.584 --> 01:13:42.984
don't you, Anthony?

01:13:42.986 --> 01:13:47.054
You know who I am, right?

01:13:47.056 --> 01:13:53.961
I'm just some fairground,
carnival,

01:13:53.963 --> 01:13:56.898
fruitcake hippie,
just walking around

01:13:56.900 --> 01:13:59.901
with a silver spoon
in his mouth...

01:13:59.903 --> 01:14:03.638
His thumb up his ass...

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:06.874
Parents' trust fund...

01:14:08.710 --> 01:14:11.012
Screwing your family...

01:14:11.014 --> 01:14:13.915
By healing them.

01:14:13.917 --> 01:14:15.983
I see you.

01:14:15.985 --> 01:14:17.618
I see you.

01:14:19.521 --> 01:14:22.857
I see your skepticism,
brother.

01:14:22.859 --> 01:14:24.225
Oh, I'm sorry?

01:14:24.227 --> 01:14:26.828
You know what?
Let's just drop the illusion

01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:29.664
of "I'm sorry" for once,
shall we?

01:14:29.666 --> 01:14:31.232
And instead let's
talk about taking

01:14:31.234 --> 01:14:34.969
some real responsibility
for our actions.

01:14:34.971 --> 01:14:38.573
Oh, I'm sorry, but,
you're not giving my brother

01:14:38.575 --> 01:14:41.242
much of an alternative
choice here.

01:14:41.244 --> 01:14:43.244
I mean, first off
you put a walkman on his head

01:14:43.246 --> 01:14:44.879
and played him some kind
of subliminal message.

01:14:44.881 --> 01:14:47.815
Subliminal messages,
really?

01:14:47.817 --> 01:14:48.983
Really,
subliminal message?

01:14:48.985 --> 01:14:50.818
-Yeah.
-Is that what you think?

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:53.020
Oh, I don't think so,
i know so.

01:14:53.022 --> 01:14:54.789
-Oh, you know so?
-I do.

01:14:54.791 --> 01:14:57.592
How else you gonna get him
to change his mind so quick?

01:14:57.594 --> 01:14:59.160
Look at him!

01:14:59.162 --> 01:15:02.763
That's transformational
vibrational frequency
healing.

01:15:02.765 --> 01:15:06.033
It's very powerful and
frankly you should try it.

01:15:06.035 --> 01:15:08.135
-Yeah.
-First off,

01:15:08.137 --> 01:15:10.071
I believe you
interrupted me.

01:15:10.073 --> 01:15:12.974
My point was,
it's either he goes

01:15:12.976 --> 01:15:14.742
to your
Sonic healing convention

01:15:14.744 --> 01:15:16.878
or he gets a divorce

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:19.213
and a custody battle?

01:15:19.215 --> 01:15:21.716
That's it.
There's no other
alternative,

01:15:21.718 --> 01:15:23.050
no other way
out of this.

01:15:23.052 --> 01:15:24.952
Anthony, actually
there's quite a number

01:15:24.954 --> 01:15:26.787
of different
opportunities.

01:15:26.789 --> 01:15:28.256
That is not
the only option.

01:15:28.258 --> 01:15:31.292
The Sonic spirit convention
has many different types

01:15:31.294 --> 01:15:33.094
of relationship healing--

01:15:33.096 --> 01:15:36.964
yeah, but that's not what
we're talking about, is it?

01:15:36.966 --> 01:15:39.734
I don't know,
why don't you tell me
what we're talking about.

01:15:39.736 --> 01:15:41.302
You're being
a close-minded asshole.

01:15:41.304 --> 01:15:42.870
I'm not being
a close-minded asshole.

01:15:42.872 --> 01:15:44.272
-You are too!
-Am not!

01:15:44.274 --> 01:15:46.240
-You are!
-Am not.

01:15:46.242 --> 01:15:49.677
Anthony, stop sticking
your butt into my business.

01:15:49.679 --> 01:15:51.178
Shit.

01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:55.917
Bro,
trust him on this.
It's an experience.

01:15:55.919 --> 01:15:58.619
Yeah.
I mean, it seems like
you're the only one

01:15:58.621 --> 01:16:00.555
that has a problem
with healing right now.

01:16:00.557 --> 01:16:03.558
I don't have
a problem with healing.

01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:05.793
I just think it's a little
narrow-minded, that's all.

01:16:05.795 --> 01:16:07.995
You know what?
I don't want to
do this anymore.

01:16:09.565 --> 01:16:11.299
-Do what?
-You have two options.

01:16:11.301 --> 01:16:12.867
You can go to
the Sonic convention

01:16:12.869 --> 01:16:15.169
and do the relationship
healing class with me,

01:16:15.171 --> 01:16:16.804
or it's over.

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:20.274
Rose, you can't
do this to me.

01:16:20.276 --> 01:16:22.944
-I'm sorry.
-Is that your answer?

01:16:24.146 --> 01:16:27.348
It's that simple to you?
This or that?

01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:29.183
What the fuck?

01:16:29.185 --> 01:16:32.053
It's pretty basic.
You either want me
or you don't.

01:16:32.055 --> 01:16:34.789
No, it's not that simple.
It's either I want you,

01:16:34.791 --> 01:16:37.692
and I go to the Sonic
healing convention

01:16:37.694 --> 01:16:40.127
or I don't get anything.
That's it, nothing.
That's it.

01:16:40.129 --> 01:16:42.296
I want you to try.
You won't try.

01:16:42.298 --> 01:16:44.098
You won't even try
the chakraphone.

01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:46.601
It's a fucking walkman!

01:16:46.603 --> 01:16:50.705
I'm drawing a line.
So you can cross it with me,
or not.

01:17:10.959 --> 01:17:14.028
All right.

01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:16.831
Fine.
I'll go.

01:17:16.833 --> 01:17:19.133
But it's bullshit.

01:17:19.135 --> 01:17:21.669
I don't accept your answer
if you call it bullshit.

01:17:21.671 --> 01:17:23.137
I feel like I should
have a little bit more
say in the--

01:17:23.139 --> 01:17:24.672
maybe you should try
the daily chakraphone.

01:17:24.674 --> 01:17:26.641
-Yeah.
-Positivity.

01:17:26.643 --> 01:17:28.809
I said I was going.
Let's just leave it at that,
all right?

01:17:28.811 --> 01:17:30.244
Okay, do you see my point?

01:17:30.246 --> 01:17:31.746
That as long as he is--

01:17:31.748 --> 01:17:33.681
I said I was going,
all right?

01:17:33.683 --> 01:17:35.249
What else do you
want from me?
I'm going.

01:17:35.251 --> 01:17:37.652
I just want him to try.

01:17:37.654 --> 01:17:39.654
I don't want him to go
through the motions.

01:17:39.656 --> 01:17:41.756
That's not the same thing,
at all.

01:17:41.758 --> 01:17:43.290
It's not the same thing!
