00:02.393 --> 00:04.004
Previously on "Relatively
Ranch Rules."

00:04.047 --> 00:06.745
I'm Ebie.
My father is Eazy-E.

00:06.789 --> 00:08.008
What's up, Daddy O?

00:08.051 --> 00:10.358
Breathe in God.
Breathe out a smile.

00:11.185 --> 00:12.360
Hi guys.

00:12.403 --> 00:14.057
- Hey.
- I'm Jasmin.

00:14.101 --> 00:15.493
Awesome.
Nice to meet you, man.

00:15.537 --> 00:18.018
My dad is Ray Parker Jr.
He's on "Ghostbusters."

00:18.061 --> 00:19.323
Billy Bob Thornton is my dad.

00:19.367 --> 00:20.759
- Whoa.
- No way.

00:20.803 --> 00:22.065
Oh man, what did
we get ourselves into?

00:22.109 --> 00:23.240
I don't know.

00:23.284 --> 00:24.850
Welcome to Saddleback Ranch.

00:24.894 --> 00:27.853
When COVID hit us,
our tourism business shut down.

00:27.897 --> 00:29.681
So your guys' job is to help us

00:29.725 --> 00:33.076
get ready for
the grand reopening in 30 days.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.208
Oh goodness.

00:36.906 --> 00:38.168
Oh, my God, take a look
at all that

00:40.040 --> 00:41.606
Oh, my God.

00:41.650 --> 00:44.174
I can tell my roommates are
gonna have a tough time here.

00:44.218 --> 00:45.523
Ebie, you're not
doing anything.

00:45.567 --> 00:47.221
I don't touch sheep.
I don't ride horses.

00:47.264 --> 00:48.352
I don't do none
of these things.

00:48.396 --> 00:50.050
Why'd you come here then?

00:50.093 --> 00:51.573
Cheers.

00:51.616 --> 00:54.054
- There you go.
- To Eazy-E.

00:54.097 --> 00:56.708
Harry!

00:56.752 --> 00:58.319
I think he's about
to throw up.

00:58.362 --> 01:00.147
No, no, no.
Open the door.

01:00.190 --> 01:01.670
What?

01:01.713 --> 01:03.541
You good?

01:03.585 --> 01:07.241
What do you consider good?

01:21.168 --> 01:24.780
- Rise and shine.
- Rise and shine.

01:37.749 --> 01:39.447
I don't know
what we're doing today.

01:39.490 --> 01:42.537
We're gonna be doing
the horses today.

01:47.150 --> 01:48.847
I lost a wallet. I check--

01:48.891 --> 01:52.286
Check the jeans
that you had on last night.

01:52.329 --> 01:55.202
Retrace your steps,
your lights on bulb--

01:55.245 --> 01:58.596
I don't remember my steps.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.598
What's your wallet look like?

02:00.642 --> 02:03.253
It's like one of those
credit card wallets.

02:03.297 --> 02:04.733
Oh, I'm dying.

02:04.776 --> 02:07.866
This is all your station?
- Yeah.

02:07.910 --> 02:11.087
Yo, how do you have
Black people hair products?

02:11.131 --> 02:12.567
I've always used it.

02:12.610 --> 02:16.179
- This is yours?
- Yeah.

02:16.223 --> 02:19.269
Harry, you're a different
type of animal.

02:19.313 --> 02:21.228
Hey, two minute warning.

02:21.271 --> 02:23.882
That's not your job, Austin.

02:23.926 --> 02:26.972
♪

02:27.016 --> 02:30.193
Two minutes.

02:30.237 --> 02:32.630
Get my cowboy Yeezys back on.

02:39.507 --> 02:42.162
Where the is Harry?

02:42.205 --> 02:46.209
Harry?

02:46.253 --> 02:48.690
What's he doing? -
I don't know.

02:48.733 --> 02:49.778
Harry?

02:52.433 --> 02:54.174
- Huh?
- He has two kids.

02:54.217 --> 02:56.045
What?

02:58.265 --> 02:59.483
Wait, how old?

02:59.527 --> 03:01.398
Like tittle,
two little toddlers.

03:01.442 --> 03:03.313
- What?
- No way.

03:03.357 --> 03:04.706
Finally.

03:07.709 --> 03:09.885
Oh, my God,
are these the horses?

03:09.928 --> 03:11.365
Oh, fire.
We're going to horses next.

03:13.802 --> 03:15.195
I didn't even
put my lipstick on yet.

03:18.546 --> 03:20.330
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

03:20.374 --> 03:22.332
- Good morning.
- Okay. You guys, horsey time.

03:22.376 --> 03:23.855
- Morning.
- Oh, my gosh.

03:23.899 --> 03:25.901
We're gonna introduce you
to your horse.

03:25.944 --> 03:27.511
- Woo.
- Yeah.

03:27.555 --> 03:29.296
Then we'll get you grooming.

03:29.339 --> 03:31.167
There's a lot to learn
with horses.

03:31.211 --> 03:34.475
So it is kind of just like
a step by step process.

03:34.518 --> 03:35.824
- Great.
- Okay.

03:35.867 --> 03:39.306
So first up
to meet their horse, Ebie.

03:41.308 --> 03:43.092
All right, you guys,
this is Smokey.

03:43.135 --> 03:45.312
- Hi, Smokey.
- Smokey.

03:45.355 --> 03:47.705
I love it 'cause I love
a smoked eye, so--

03:50.055 --> 03:52.797
This is their peripheral
and they see this way.

03:52.841 --> 03:56.279
So you wanna stay
on their sides. Okay?

03:56.323 --> 03:57.933
Hello.

03:57.976 --> 04:01.197
We need to get the roommates
familiar with these horses now

04:01.241 --> 04:02.546
because we're going to be
using the horses

04:02.590 --> 04:04.374
for our grand reopening,

04:04.418 --> 04:05.941
you know, getting 'em out
on the trails,

04:05.984 --> 04:08.552
training them up
to become trail guides.

04:08.596 --> 04:10.380
And then the cattle drive
is coming up.

04:10.424 --> 04:11.903
Okay. I am scared.

04:11.947 --> 04:13.427
Well, he just moves
a little bit.

04:13.470 --> 04:16.256
They're not statues.

04:16.299 --> 04:19.302
So we've got Mariposa to Tay.

04:19.346 --> 04:21.391
Tay, come on in.

04:21.435 --> 04:22.914
- That was my name in Spanish.
- Really?

04:22.958 --> 04:25.395
Oh, my God.
Ready, best friend?

04:25.439 --> 04:27.441
- All right, Hana.
- Hi, baby.

04:27.484 --> 04:30.748
This is Cloudy.
This is Cactus.

04:30.792 --> 04:35.231
This horse's name is Echo.
Ooh, Diamond.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.580
Diamond, baby.

04:36.624 --> 04:40.932
We've got Stetson.

04:40.976 --> 04:43.935
Blue Duck is for Redmond.
So just grab here.

04:43.979 --> 04:46.242
This gonna be your steering
and we'll head out finally.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.678
No problem.
I'm no stranger to this.

04:47.722 --> 04:49.985
I got horseback riding lessons
when I was a kid.

04:50.028 --> 04:51.508
I think I was nine years old

04:51.552 --> 04:53.597
when I first started getting
horseback riding lessons.

04:53.641 --> 04:56.513
And I've always had like
the urge to go fast

04:56.557 --> 04:59.777
and, you know, give me
the fastest horse you got.

04:59.821 --> 05:01.953
You know, just like getting
into a brand new race car,

05:01.997 --> 05:04.782
it allows me just to escape
whatever type of hardship

05:04.826 --> 05:07.263
I was going through
with my life.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.830
All right.

05:08.873 --> 05:12.050
I feel connected to this horse
now, can't wait to ride him.

05:12.094 --> 05:14.966
So let me teach you how
to safely go around a horse.

05:15.010 --> 05:16.794
They kick out like this,

05:16.838 --> 05:18.622
and they can kick you
like this.

05:18.666 --> 05:20.842
So whenever you approach
a horse, you wanna be like,

05:20.885 --> 05:24.019
"Hey, Stetson, I'm right here.
I'm coming around."

05:24.062 --> 05:25.760
So they have that level
of awareness.

05:25.803 --> 05:27.109
Uh-huh.

05:27.152 --> 05:28.676
And then obviously
this is angry, angry kitty.

05:28.719 --> 05:30.460
These horses have
been out all winter.

05:30.504 --> 05:31.722
I'm in love with this horse.

05:31.766 --> 05:33.811
So when you start
with their hair,

05:33.855 --> 05:35.813
a lot of stuff
will be pulled out.

05:35.857 --> 05:39.339
Let's get this old hair
off of you.

05:39.382 --> 05:41.341
That's a good girl.

05:41.384 --> 05:43.908
Need some styling,
gentlemen, eh?

05:43.952 --> 05:47.477
Got you, gotta get you
looking right.

05:47.521 --> 05:49.653
I don't want to go behind it.

05:49.697 --> 05:51.873
Myles hasn't even
touched his horse.

05:51.916 --> 05:53.353
Here, just be my
shadow, okay?

05:53.396 --> 05:54.484
Okay.

05:54.528 --> 05:56.094
Are you scared, Myles?

05:56.138 --> 05:57.618
Go for it, Myles.

05:57.661 --> 06:01.926
Yep. I'm protecting you, see,
stay on my right. Yep.

06:04.712 --> 06:07.410
This is like
a 2,000 pound animal.

06:07.454 --> 06:09.978
Definitely afraid
for my safety and stuff.

06:10.021 --> 06:11.414
This is too much.

06:11.458 --> 06:13.024
Do you have a dog
or anything?

06:13.068 --> 06:14.809
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
I used to have a dog.

06:14.852 --> 06:16.463
Okay.
So this is like a big dog.

06:16.506 --> 06:20.205
They're looking to you for that
bond and that like connection.

06:20.249 --> 06:21.685
Yeah.

06:21.729 --> 06:23.861
You know, I'm way outside
of my comfort zone on this.

06:23.905 --> 06:25.689
I'm not meant to ride horses.

06:25.733 --> 06:28.518
I've worked like doing modeling
and DJing.

06:28.562 --> 06:31.391
I walked in Milan
for Dolce & Gabbana.

06:31.434 --> 06:35.656
My mom is an entrepreneur
and my dad is Shaquille O'Neal,

06:35.699 --> 06:38.093
four-time NBA champion.

06:38.136 --> 06:40.138
This experience
is definitely a first.

06:40.182 --> 06:41.836
I'm here on the ranch
because I want to help.

06:41.879 --> 06:44.491
But this is definitely stuff
I'm not used to.

06:44.534 --> 06:46.231
All right, Cactus.

06:46.275 --> 06:48.059
So have you touched him yet?

06:48.103 --> 06:49.713
Oh, well, I tried to
at the beginning

06:49.757 --> 06:52.237
and then I could just sense
a weird energy.

06:52.281 --> 06:53.848
Come over here.

06:53.891 --> 06:56.285
No, you sure you guys don't
wanna pair me up with a pony?

06:56.328 --> 06:59.462
Well, if your horse
to doesn't know you there--

06:59.506 --> 07:01.899
Uh-oh.

07:01.943 --> 07:06.730
Stop following me.
My horse is trippin'.

07:06.774 --> 07:08.645
I'm not sure if Ebie
was really prepared

07:08.689 --> 07:10.255
for what we were gonna
be getting ourselves into.

07:10.299 --> 07:12.257
Take your jacket off
and come over here.

07:12.301 --> 07:13.476
Mm.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.173
And she's just dressed
to the nines.

07:15.217 --> 07:17.828
I mean designer everything
and ready to go

07:17.872 --> 07:20.265
like she's doing
a music video shoot.

07:20.309 --> 07:21.441
Come on.

07:21.484 --> 07:23.834
My bones are stuck.
They won't move.

07:23.878 --> 07:25.445
I'm gonna help you move.

07:25.488 --> 07:26.750
And they won't move,
I'm serious.

07:26.794 --> 07:28.143
- I'm helping you move.
- Oh, my God.

07:28.186 --> 07:31.102
This is--this is
such a good thing.

07:32.756 --> 07:35.193
Just stand like right here.
Put this hand up here.

07:35.237 --> 07:36.760
I just can't.

07:36.804 --> 07:39.284
Do you wanna be that person
that's, like,

07:39.328 --> 07:43.245
gives up just because things
aren't going your way?

07:43.288 --> 07:44.507
Maybe.

07:44.551 --> 07:46.683
We are here
to get our hands dirty.

07:46.727 --> 07:49.164
I think that's gonna be
really tough for Ebie.

07:49.207 --> 07:51.383
Right, you guys,
you met your horses.

07:51.427 --> 07:52.994
You got to spend
some time with them.

07:53.037 --> 07:57.259
This is really important.
This is the first step of many.

07:57.302 --> 07:59.479
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

08:02.656 --> 08:03.831
Yeah.

08:03.874 --> 08:06.137
I would kill for a Starbucks.

08:21.022 --> 08:24.286
I'm gonna take my two-
minute shower before you guys.

08:24.329 --> 08:26.114
- You're not--are you hungry?
- A little bit.

08:26.157 --> 08:28.638
I feel like beef, y'all,
you know what I'm saying?

08:35.297 --> 08:36.646
Okay, so you season

08:36.690 --> 08:38.692
it like this and kind of
get it all through there.

08:38.735 --> 08:40.258
I mean,
I'm only doing one patty,

08:40.302 --> 08:42.870
so I don't have to do a lot.
This is essential.

08:42.913 --> 08:44.915
Garlic powder
in like everything.

08:44.959 --> 08:46.221
No, I need you to act
like you don't know this stuff.

08:46.264 --> 08:47.527
Oh.

08:47.570 --> 08:48.832
- This is my cooking show.
- My bad.

08:48.876 --> 08:50.355
You're supposed to be
learning from me.

08:50.399 --> 08:51.966
I am a great cook.
Okay?

08:52.009 --> 08:53.097
I actually make
a lot of things,

08:53.141 --> 08:54.664
but I've actually
never made a burger.

08:56.884 --> 08:59.800
Oh, it's so steamy.

08:59.843 --> 09:01.236
You know, I'm no chef,

09:01.279 --> 09:04.195
but something's
going wrong very quickly.

09:04.239 --> 09:05.936
No, it's already
cooking too fast.

09:05.980 --> 09:08.243
It's high. This one's high.

09:08.286 --> 09:10.680
I need a spatula.

09:10.724 --> 09:13.074
I'm gonna say you need
a quick commercial break.

09:13.117 --> 09:15.859
Guys, I just realized
he had it so high.

09:15.903 --> 09:18.166
- It is smokey in here.
- It's not my fault.

09:18.209 --> 09:19.210
Smoke alarm.

09:19.254 --> 09:22.300
Let's try opening
this window.

09:22.344 --> 09:25.608
Being a celebrity's kid,
there's a lot of pressure

09:25.652 --> 09:27.915
to live up
to certain expectations.

09:27.958 --> 09:29.873
That's extra well done.

09:29.917 --> 09:32.920
Shut up.
It's not my fault.

09:32.963 --> 09:34.399
My dad is Martin Lawrence

09:34.443 --> 09:38.142
and my stepdad is NFL
Hall of Famer Emmitt Smith.

09:38.186 --> 09:39.579
Ebie?

09:39.622 --> 09:41.668
- Mm?
- Oh, Ebie!

09:41.711 --> 09:43.365
It's not my fault!

09:43.408 --> 09:44.714
So I remember when I was young,

09:44.758 --> 09:47.325
always feeling like I needed
to overcompensate,

09:47.369 --> 09:49.371
like I just needed
to do everything right

09:49.414 --> 09:51.068
the first time, no mistakes.

09:51.112 --> 09:52.504
Let's see how
burger number two goes.

09:53.636 --> 09:54.898
Jasmin is a perfectionist.

09:54.942 --> 09:56.639
So I completely get
where she's coming from.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.119
I mean,
as soon as anyone knows,

09:58.162 --> 10:00.817
you know, who your parents are,
all eyes are on you,

10:00.861 --> 10:03.124
you know, your situation
is just different.

10:03.167 --> 10:05.822
- Just letting the cheese--
- Letting the cheese what?

10:05.866 --> 10:07.432
- Melt.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:07.476 --> 10:09.043
Great idea.

10:09.086 --> 10:11.088
Before you even walk
into a room, people have made

10:11.132 --> 10:14.091
all these assumptions about you
and they don't even know you.

10:14.135 --> 10:15.092
Cook it up.
Cook it up.

10:15.136 --> 10:16.398
This is about to be so good.

10:16.441 --> 10:17.747
That looks good.
I'm so proud of you.

10:17.791 --> 10:20.576
Oh man.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.623
I have to remind myself,
"You don't have to be perfect."

10:23.666 --> 10:26.234
It actually is so good.

10:26.277 --> 10:28.932
- Who do we have left?
- Ooh. I don't like that.

10:28.976 --> 10:30.673
Oh, she ramming up,
she ramming up.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.675
I will hop this fence.

10:48.125 --> 10:49.605
Hey, we gotta
start heading out.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.868
- Okay.
- Let's go horseback riding.

10:51.912 --> 10:53.870
- Yee-haw.
- Yee.

10:53.914 --> 10:55.002
Ready.

10:55.045 --> 10:57.439
Goodness gracious.

10:57.482 --> 10:59.920
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

11:06.927 --> 11:10.844
Oh God. Oh, my God,
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

11:12.802 --> 11:14.064
I'm putting my seatbelt.

11:19.591 --> 11:21.724
Oh yeah. There they are.

11:23.073 --> 11:25.685
This ain't my first rodeo.

11:25.728 --> 11:27.382
- Morning.
- Good morning.

11:27.425 --> 11:28.905
What's going on?

11:28.949 --> 11:31.603
Ooh, you got some fringe
going over there.

11:31.647 --> 11:32.648
Oh yeah.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.258
We got your horses
ready here.

11:34.302 --> 11:35.520
Remember yesterday you met 'em,

11:35.564 --> 11:37.958
so hopefully you remembered
their names.

11:38.001 --> 11:40.003
Today, we're gonna get you on.

11:40.047 --> 11:41.875
- Hey.
- Yes.

11:41.918 --> 11:43.964
So we're gonna just go--
kind of go one at a time.

11:44.007 --> 11:46.227
Does anybody wanna go first?
- Okay. I'll go first.

11:46.270 --> 11:47.315
- Ladies first.
- Woo. Yeah, ladies first.

11:47.358 --> 11:49.056
- Yeah. Get it, girl.
- Woo!

11:49.099 --> 11:49.970
I think I don't need
my jacket.

11:50.013 --> 11:51.188
Let's go.

11:51.232 --> 11:52.537
One of the first things
you need to do

11:52.581 --> 11:53.582
is bridle your horse.

11:53.625 --> 11:56.411
You take these two fingers

11:56.454 --> 11:59.762
and you're actually
opening his mouth.

11:59.806 --> 12:02.504
I ain't putting my fingernail
in his mouth.

12:02.547 --> 12:05.463
I've seen too many fingers
get bit off.

12:05.507 --> 12:06.856
- Have you?
- Yeah, bro.

12:06.900 --> 12:08.466
'Cause they'll think
it's a carrot.

12:08.510 --> 12:10.381
They'll take it right off.

12:12.557 --> 12:15.473
When I get on a horse,
I turn my stirrup,

12:15.517 --> 12:17.780
put my foot in, this hand
back here, and swing over.

12:17.824 --> 12:18.999
Got it.

12:19.042 --> 12:20.217
- Okay?
- Okay.

12:20.261 --> 12:21.653
You got it, girl.

12:24.047 --> 12:25.179
- Yeah.
- Yay. Woo.

12:25.222 --> 12:26.528
- Go, baby.
- Yeah.

12:26.571 --> 12:28.922
- Nice.
- Move those muscles.

12:28.965 --> 12:30.706
- Woo.
- Yes.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.187
It doesn't take a lot
for this horse to move forward.

12:33.230 --> 12:36.494
- Okay.
- So start squeezing, okay?

12:36.538 --> 12:39.280
Okay, go.
Go.

12:39.323 --> 12:42.239
- Go girl.
- Yeah. Like a pro.

12:42.283 --> 12:43.545
Yes. Hum.

12:43.588 --> 12:45.852
Let's see a turn
in this direction.

12:45.895 --> 12:47.636
Woo, looking good.

12:47.679 --> 12:50.595
Nice. Let's do a turn
the other way now.

12:50.639 --> 12:52.380
- You're a real pro!
- You're doing really well.

12:52.423 --> 12:53.555
- Thank you.
- Good job.

12:53.598 --> 12:54.861
She let the hair down.

12:54.904 --> 12:57.820
This just turned into
"Sports Illustrated."

13:00.083 --> 13:01.693
Remain calm.

13:04.740 --> 13:06.742
- That was really good.
- Thank you.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.614
Yeah. Yeah.

13:09.658 --> 13:12.748
You're gonna lead him
over here and your end's up.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.837
So I think the next volunteer
was Austin.

13:14.881 --> 13:15.838
Go Austin.

13:15.882 --> 13:17.884
- Get on up there.
- Giddy-up.

13:17.927 --> 13:21.061
- Oh.
- It's all right. Try again.

13:23.150 --> 13:25.239
- There you go.
- Whoo.

13:25.282 --> 13:29.199
How y'all doing?

13:29.243 --> 13:33.073
Good job.
Okay. Mariposa.

13:33.116 --> 13:36.250
- Let's go, Tay.
- Yeah, Tay.

13:36.293 --> 13:37.338
Look at that.

13:40.123 --> 13:42.430
Up and over.

13:42.473 --> 13:43.779
Perfect.
- Cool.

13:43.823 --> 13:46.826
Keep him turning.
Perfect circle. Nice.

13:46.869 --> 13:48.305
He's amazing.

13:48.349 --> 13:50.873
I definitely got the dopest
horse. That's for sure.

13:50.917 --> 13:53.223
Me and Blue Duck just have
an amazing connection.

13:53.267 --> 13:55.051
It's like a perfect bond.

13:55.095 --> 13:57.706
You're a natural. All right.
You have to pop one down.

13:57.749 --> 14:00.187
- I don't want to get down.
- You have to.

14:00.230 --> 14:01.753
Can I just do
one more circle?

14:01.797 --> 14:03.277
No, it's not fair
to everybody else.

14:03.320 --> 14:04.756
He's really genuinely upset
that he has to get off.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.933
- Yeah.
- You can see that.

14:06.976 --> 14:09.413
Who do we have left?

14:09.457 --> 14:11.589
Ooh, I don't like that.

14:11.633 --> 14:13.243
What's that noise mean?

14:13.287 --> 14:16.246
Ebie.

14:16.290 --> 14:18.379
How are you?
How are you feeling?

14:18.422 --> 14:20.468
- A little nervous.
- Okay.

14:20.511 --> 14:22.470
But I'm gonna try.

14:22.513 --> 14:24.472
- Let's go, Ebie.
- I'm scared.

14:24.515 --> 14:25.908
- She's got this.
- You got this.

14:25.952 --> 14:29.477
She's got this tall horse.
Let's see, you got this.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.044
- There you go.
- Oh God.

14:31.087 --> 14:32.262
All right. Take a breath.

14:32.306 --> 14:33.873
There we go.

14:33.916 --> 14:35.787
They do work
with the commands.

14:35.831 --> 14:37.789
Confidence, baby.
Confidence.

14:43.273 --> 14:46.233
It's not Ebie, it's Smokey.

14:46.276 --> 14:50.324
I think Ebie is holding
Ebie back from ranch life.

14:50.367 --> 14:51.978
He's ready to go.

14:52.021 --> 14:53.588
We need a lazy horse.

14:53.631 --> 14:56.983
And I think when Ebie decides
that the ranch is for her,

14:57.026 --> 14:58.375
she's gonna crush it.

14:58.419 --> 15:00.508
I feel like Ebie's
gonna have a meme after this.

15:04.294 --> 15:07.471
Let's hop off of this horse
and slide down just like that.

15:07.515 --> 15:09.386
Myles,
remember your buddy Cactus?

15:09.430 --> 15:10.953
Myles.

15:10.997 --> 15:13.521
So his bridle is gonna go
into the horse's mouth.

15:13.564 --> 15:15.958
Do you wanna attempt it?
- No. It's cool.

15:16.002 --> 15:17.786
So since he's big

15:17.829 --> 15:21.964
with your right hand grab
and pull yourself up.

15:22.008 --> 15:26.969
Yep. Perfect.
All right. Try left.

15:27.013 --> 15:27.970
Oh. Ho-ho-ho-ho.

15:28.014 --> 15:29.493
- Isn't that amazing?
- No.

15:29.537 --> 15:30.712
This is the hardest part.

15:30.755 --> 15:31.887
Just getting you
to the movement.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.193
- Oh, oh, oh, oh.
- You're okay.

15:33.236 --> 15:34.803
You're okay. You're okay.

15:34.846 --> 15:36.239
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna get off.

15:36.283 --> 15:37.719
Oh,
Totally get off.

15:37.762 --> 15:41.027
Okay. Relax.

15:41.070 --> 15:43.333
I'm probably the fourth
Black person I've ever seen

15:43.377 --> 15:44.291
on a horse in my life.

15:46.075 --> 15:50.950
I think that Myles
is tentative about failing.

15:50.993 --> 15:52.995
Maybe he wasn't ready for that.

15:53.039 --> 15:56.999
I'm not a horse guy.
I'm not a ranch guy, so.

15:59.567 --> 16:02.004
Probably have all never
delivered calves before.

16:04.006 --> 16:07.314
Oh, truly is life and death
if you're on your game or not.

16:17.237 --> 16:18.934
Horses are so nice.

16:20.762 --> 16:22.851
Aww.

16:22.894 --> 16:24.026
How we doing today?

16:24.070 --> 16:25.332
- Great.
- Great how are you?

16:25.375 --> 16:26.855
- Doing well, thank you.
- Great, great, great.

16:26.898 --> 16:29.118
- What do we have here?
- What do we have to do today?

16:29.162 --> 16:31.251
Probably have all
never delivered calves before.

16:31.294 --> 16:32.252
Anybody here?
- No.

16:32.295 --> 16:33.340
I can't say I have, sir.

16:33.383 --> 16:34.341
It's what I do
in my spare time.

16:34.384 --> 16:35.951
First time.
All right.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.953
So this right here
is our livelihood.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.390
Live calves is our profit
in the fall.

16:40.434 --> 16:41.913
We sell our calves,
so it's very important

16:41.957 --> 16:46.092
that we get live calves
and this is gonna be your job.

16:46.135 --> 16:49.225
All right. We've got
one cow left the calf.

16:49.269 --> 16:50.966
She's getting really,
really close.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.229
So since you guys
don't know the signs

16:53.273 --> 16:54.752
and you've never seen it,

16:54.796 --> 16:58.408
we're gonna have you guys watch
nonstop continuously.

16:58.452 --> 16:59.714
Continuously for like
how long?

16:59.757 --> 17:01.107
Always, what does that mean?
Like how long?

17:01.150 --> 17:02.586
- Yeah, like always like--
- For 24 hours.

17:02.630 --> 17:03.761
Like 24 hours?

17:03.805 --> 17:05.067
- Camp out.
- Camp out.

17:05.111 --> 17:06.373
Camp out, right here.

17:06.416 --> 17:07.983
Camp out?

17:08.027 --> 17:10.377
When cows are birthing their
calf, you need to be there.

17:10.420 --> 17:12.118
You need to make sure
that that calf

17:12.161 --> 17:14.468
is gonna hit the ground
and be a live calf.

17:14.511 --> 17:17.601
It's definitely something
that these new ranch hands

17:17.645 --> 17:20.691
need to go through.
That's what ranchers do.

17:20.735 --> 17:23.085
When we're looking
and observing our cows,

17:23.129 --> 17:25.087
she goes through
three stages of labor.

17:25.131 --> 17:26.828
Stage one is they're
just getting ready.

17:26.871 --> 17:28.525
You're seeing subtle changes.

17:28.569 --> 17:30.310
Maybe they're off
by themselves.

17:30.353 --> 17:33.748
Maybe their tail's swishing.
When we go into stage two,

17:33.791 --> 17:35.967
she's gonna start having
active contractions

17:36.011 --> 17:37.621
and you can see that.

17:37.665 --> 17:40.494
When it's textbook normal,
you're gonna see two feet

17:40.537 --> 17:43.584
and then a nose.
If at any time we're suspicious

17:43.627 --> 17:45.325
that something
may not be right,

17:45.368 --> 17:47.936
then that's when we need
to get ranch owners involved

17:47.979 --> 17:50.852
'cause it truly is life
and death for this calf

17:50.895 --> 17:52.114
if you're on your game or not.

17:52.158 --> 17:53.637
Call us if you need us.

17:53.681 --> 17:54.899
- Okay.
- Okay.

17:54.943 --> 17:56.466
But we don't ever intervene

17:56.510 --> 17:58.642
if everything looks
normal, good.

17:58.686 --> 18:01.297
If the calf comes out,
we always watch to make sure

18:01.341 --> 18:03.125
that it,
you know, it's got movement.

18:03.169 --> 18:05.301
Once we know that we just
stand back and watch.

18:05.345 --> 18:07.477
Don't interfere
in that process.

18:07.521 --> 18:09.784
- Do you guys have binoculars?
- We do.

18:09.827 --> 18:11.394
- We do.
- Amazing.

18:11.438 --> 18:13.701
'Cause I'm gonna stand back
and do the watching.

18:15.268 --> 18:16.660
The next thing that needs
to happen

18:16.704 --> 18:19.533
is there is commercial
cow milk available.

18:19.576 --> 18:22.449
We can use a feeder
and get it into the calf.

18:22.492 --> 18:24.494
All right, guys,
split into groups.

18:24.538 --> 18:27.236
I need four of you guys
down here watching.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.369
- Can we go with our cars team?
- Sure.

18:29.412 --> 18:30.848
- That could work.
- That will work.

18:30.892 --> 18:32.459
- Yeah, we could start.
- You guys go first? Okay.

18:32.502 --> 18:34.287
Yeah. Let's do that.
All right.

18:34.330 --> 18:35.810
So we'll just drive up,
pick up stuff from the house

18:35.853 --> 18:36.854
and bring down--back down here.

18:36.898 --> 18:38.204
Okay.

18:38.247 --> 18:42.121
Harry, take care of Austin.

18:42.164 --> 18:43.470
First watch.

18:43.513 --> 18:45.428
Which one are we watching?

18:45.472 --> 18:47.517
The one with the green tag
over there in the corner.

18:48.823 --> 18:53.828
- So he's kind of staying here?
- I guess.

18:53.871 --> 18:56.178
They're up a storm
over there.

19:00.530 --> 19:01.836
I'm gonna hit the kitchen.

19:01.879 --> 19:03.664
I'll get us some drinks
from the cooler.

19:03.707 --> 19:05.579
Guys, we should get like
maybe a blanket.

19:05.622 --> 19:08.059
I'm gonna put
a few Rockstars in there too.

19:08.103 --> 19:10.105
I got the chairs, guys.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.889
This is about
all I could carry.

19:11.933 --> 19:13.369
One two, three.

19:13.413 --> 19:17.634
Good, looking good.
Teamwork make the dream work.

19:17.678 --> 19:19.810
Yeah, it does.

19:24.119 --> 19:25.773
Calvary is here.

19:25.816 --> 19:28.558
We got some towels
for the placenta.

19:28.602 --> 19:30.908
Oh, where are you guys
posted up at?

19:30.952 --> 19:31.909
Right there.

19:31.953 --> 19:33.084
- Over there?
- Yeah.

19:33.128 --> 19:34.216
In this automobile.

19:34.260 --> 19:35.739
Here we go.
Here you go, babe.

19:35.783 --> 19:37.176
- I got a double right here.
- That's for queen.

19:37.219 --> 19:38.438
- Oh, that's huge.
- Queen B.

19:38.481 --> 19:40.048
I got something good
for you guys.

19:40.091 --> 19:41.876
How long you guys
taking to watch?

19:41.919 --> 19:44.748
- Hour and a half.
- Uh.

19:44.792 --> 19:47.273
Why would you ever want
to take first shift?

19:47.316 --> 19:50.145
You know what I mean?
That makes no sense to me.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.799
Hold down the fort, y'all.

19:51.842 --> 19:54.410
I mean, I really don't think
the calf is gonna come today.

19:54.454 --> 19:58.022
- Have fun, guys.
- See you later, partner.

19:58.066 --> 19:59.589
So now what?

19:59.633 --> 20:03.419
It's gonna be a long night
for first shift.

20:03.463 --> 20:04.594
They're in for
a little surprise

20:04.638 --> 20:07.597
when we don't show back up.

20:07.641 --> 20:11.949
Strap in for the long
haul, buddy.

20:11.993 --> 20:14.387
I wonder if there's something
we could speed up the process.

20:14.430 --> 20:16.215
Like when a lady's pregnant,

20:16.258 --> 20:18.347
they go in like a warm bath
or something.

20:18.391 --> 20:19.609
I don't know about that.

20:19.653 --> 20:23.134
I have no idea
about pregnancy.

20:23.178 --> 20:24.266
- You do though.
- I do.

20:24.310 --> 20:25.572
You do though.

20:25.615 --> 20:27.400
- Wait. Yeah.
- Yeah. What are you--

20:27.443 --> 20:29.576
I totally forgot.

20:29.619 --> 20:33.623
It's true, I have two kids,
a five and a half year old

20:33.667 --> 20:36.844
and a two and a half year old,
Mia and Nikita.

20:36.887 --> 20:40.282
And then I also
have my fiancée, Maggie.

20:40.326 --> 20:42.893
Growing up,
my dad always worked a lot,

20:42.937 --> 20:45.766
but it never stopped him
from putting as much attention

20:45.809 --> 20:47.594
into me
and my brother as he could.

20:47.637 --> 20:51.075
And I think I try to apply
the same rules to my kids.

20:51.119 --> 20:53.121
Come, come, come, come.

20:54.688 --> 20:57.168
What do you think
that cow needs?

20:57.212 --> 21:00.302
Do we need to do it
like a dance?

21:00.346 --> 21:02.304
Wasn't one of the signs
the tail

21:02.348 --> 21:03.958
like swinging back and forth?

21:04.001 --> 21:06.569
It's doing it,
but like every once in a while.

21:06.613 --> 21:11.226
She's about to pop.
Hopefully.

21:21.062 --> 21:22.542
Kind of cold.

21:22.585 --> 21:24.674
Why did we volunteer
to do this first?

21:24.718 --> 21:26.807
Does anybody know
if they're on their way?

21:26.850 --> 21:28.678
Do you really expect them
to switch out?

21:28.722 --> 21:31.855
They're probably at home
chilling, drinking a beer.

21:31.899 --> 21:34.467
Are these tater tots?
I love tater tots.

21:34.510 --> 21:37.252
What is going on?

21:39.036 --> 21:40.342
Calf watching is boring.

21:40.386 --> 21:42.692
You're watching a cow
do nothing

21:42.736 --> 21:45.216
'cause that's what cows do.
Nothing.

21:45.260 --> 21:49.612
Ooh, mind over matter,
mind over matter.

21:49.656 --> 21:53.355
And maybe it'll give birth
today or tonight or tomorrow.

21:53.399 --> 21:55.009
We could be out here for weeks.

21:55.052 --> 21:57.185
We have no idea
how long this is gonna take.

21:59.753 --> 22:02.408
Hey, how do we speed
this process up?

22:02.451 --> 22:05.498
We've just been watching
this cow for hours.

two weeks ago that I would be

in the middle of Colorado

23:33.063 --> 23:36.893
watching a cow,
waiting for it to give birth,

23:36.937 --> 23:39.679
I would tell you
you sound like an idiot.

23:56.957 --> 24:00.439
This is really
getting tough, y'all.

24:02.484 --> 24:04.225
You smell like beer
and cigarettes.

24:05.574 --> 24:08.838
You smell like a gas station.

24:08.882 --> 24:10.492
Oh, something just
fell out of her.

24:14.714 --> 24:15.541
She's dripping.

Yo, it's happening, come on,
come on. We gotta go now.

24:35.125 --> 24:37.345
I am so excited and nervous.

24:37.388 --> 24:38.999
I just really hope
it all goes well.

24:42.698 --> 24:46.093
Here, come over here.
Come over here, babe.

24:46.136 --> 24:50.010
- Mom is looking at it.
- I know, I know.

24:50.053 --> 24:51.446
- How crazy is it?
- Look.

24:51.490 --> 24:52.665
Wow.

24:52.708 --> 24:56.538
Oh, my God.
No way.

24:56.582 --> 25:00.411

25:08.811 --> 25:11.379
See, this calf,
it's really cool.

25:11.422 --> 25:14.077
It made this watching
experience,

25:14.121 --> 25:17.428
this very long
monitoring experience worth it.

25:17.472 --> 25:19.039
Oh, oh.

25:19.082 --> 25:22.869
At first I was like a little
hesitant about watching it,

25:22.912 --> 25:25.872
but this is like super,
super rewarding.

25:25.915 --> 25:27.047
It was beautiful.

25:27.090 --> 25:28.352
What should we name him?

25:29.919 --> 25:32.095

Yes.

26:13.833 --> 26:15.051
- Yes.
- Cheers, guys.

26:15.095 --> 26:16.923
Yes.

26:16.966 --> 26:18.925
I wanna sit down on a couch.

26:18.968 --> 26:21.841
This looks way too comfortable

26:21.884 --> 26:24.495
Wow. This is the life.

26:24.539 --> 26:27.673
- Hey. Yo.
- Yes, Harry.

26:27.716 --> 26:28.935
- Hi.
- Hi, Harry.

26:28.978 --> 26:32.286
Hi. What can I mix, uh,
Hennessy with?

26:32.329 --> 26:34.157
I got you. I'll make you one,
I'll make you one.

26:34.201 --> 26:36.116

26:36.159 --> 26:37.900
He loves Hennessy!

26:37.944 --> 26:40.250
Go with the Coke,
Harry, Coke.

26:40.294 --> 26:42.601
I love Harry so much.

26:42.644 --> 26:45.560
Who's your favorite person
in the house?

26:45.604 --> 26:47.083
Now you're putting me
on the spot.

26:47.127 --> 26:48.650
I know, Harry.

26:48.694 --> 26:50.130
Bring him back.

26:50.173 --> 26:51.479
- No, you can't do this to me.
- Yes, get in.

26:51.522 --> 26:52.654
Come on, boogie,
we're doing it now.

26:52.698 --> 26:54.177
We love you.

26:54.221 --> 26:56.658
Who do you think is
the most connected to you here?

26:56.702 --> 26:58.268
I think the most similar
to me,

26:58.312 --> 27:00.401
Ebie and Jasmin.
- Oh wow.

27:00.444 --> 27:02.664
I think they both have
some level of anxiety

27:02.708 --> 27:04.231
and I think
I have that problem.

27:04.274 --> 27:05.667
- For sure.
- Oh, okay. Got you.

27:05.711 --> 27:06.973
Okay. Yeah.
Okay.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.067
I know he does.

27:14.110 --> 27:15.416
I know. I definitely know
who you don't love, Austin.

27:15.459 --> 27:16.983
No, but I'm not gonna
confirm or deny. What?

27:17.026 --> 27:19.333
Austin.

27:38.395 --> 27:40.397
I was like,
love of my life to be honest.

27:40.441 --> 27:44.837

No.

very connected on that level.

Wait, wait, save my seat.
Save it.

I'm trying to talk to Harry
about how much I love him.

28:17.783 --> 28:21.090
And he's like--he got up
to leave and like whatever.

28:21.134 --> 28:22.396
He just got up and left.

28:22.439 --> 28:23.702
- He just left.
- It was so embarrassing.

28:23.745 --> 28:25.225

my younger brother.

28:26.269 --> 28:27.706
He just got up and left.

28:27.749 --> 28:29.229
He might not have wanted
to hear you

28:29.272 --> 28:30.926
look at him
like a little brother.

28:30.970 --> 28:33.755
Oh,

28:33.799 --> 28:36.366
He took it as like--
as you saying, like,

28:36.410 --> 28:37.759
I think of you as a friend

28:37.803 --> 28:40.370
and I know that's not
what you meant at all.

28:40.414 --> 28:42.416
- But we are friends.
- I know.

28:42.459 --> 28:44.157

from her?

28:44.200 --> 28:45.767
Well, yeah.

28:45.811 --> 28:48.074
Why would she say I look like
her younger brother?

28:48.117 --> 28:49.336
I mean that's an insult.

28:49.379 --> 28:50.598
- No, no, no.
- Yeah.

28:50.641 --> 28:53.253

why is that an insult?

28:53.296 --> 28:55.255
Okay.
Let me just say it frankly.

28:55.298 --> 28:56.778
You're saying I'm unattractive.

28:56.822 --> 28:58.780
Oh, my God.

28:58.824 --> 29:01.478
You just said I'm ugly.

29:01.522 --> 29:03.611
You just said I'm the ugliest
person you've ever met.

29:03.654 --> 29:07.528
That's what that means, right?

29:07.571 --> 29:09.051

And I like wanna mother you,
it's not a bad thing.

29:11.053 --> 29:14.361

- That's so weird!

29:14.404 --> 29:16.450

in a rude way!

29:29.550 --> 29:30.812
I don't, he has two kids
and a fiancée. I don't get it.

29:30.856 --> 29:32.509
No.
That's not what it's about.

29:32.553 --> 29:34.642
It's just like in general,
it's like a,

29:34.685 --> 29:37.645
"Damn, she doesn't even think
I'm cute at all."

29:37.688 --> 29:39.734
that, dude.
I think you're sexy, bro.

29:39.778 --> 29:42.302
Thank you. And I didn't say
you look like my mom.

29:43.433 --> 29:46.219
Oh yeah.

29:46.262 --> 29:47.655
I don't understand.

29:47.698 --> 29:49.439
I meant that
in the nicest way possible.

29:49.483 --> 29:51.050
'Cause we all look through
a different lens.

29:51.093 --> 29:52.399
And his lens is just different.

29:52.442 --> 29:55.315
So what's his lens then?
He likes me.

29:55.358 --> 29:56.664
That's why we don't
understand it.

29:56.707 --> 29:58.013
- He likes you.
- He likes me.

29:58.057 --> 29:59.798
I'm sad because, like,
I thought he's, like,

29:59.841 --> 30:01.495
one of my best friends here
and now I feel like

30:01.538 --> 30:03.845
there's a weird animosity
and this is weird.

30:07.370 --> 30:08.937
Walk away.

30:08.981 --> 30:10.330
with me one more
time, I will hit you.

30:10.373 --> 30:11.548
- Go for it.
- Guaranteed.

30:11.592 --> 30:12.941
Go for it.
You don't scare me.

30:12.985 --> 30:14.203
I don't need to scare you.

30:14.247 --> 30:16.205
I'm just letting you know
what will happen.

30:28.783 --> 30:29.828
Feel good, baby.

30:32.352 --> 30:35.094
You want some coffee?

30:35.137 --> 30:37.531
You gotta make it.
I drank the last drip.

30:40.229 --> 30:43.972
I'm exhausted.

30:44.016 --> 30:46.192
We birthed a cow yesterday.

30:46.235 --> 30:48.237
It was really exciting seeing
that baby calf being born.

30:48.281 --> 30:50.022
We literally saw
like its hooves

30:50.065 --> 30:53.460
and its nose like I'm here,
I'm out, I'm coming out.

30:53.503 --> 30:56.463
Wow. That's so cool.

30:56.506 --> 30:57.943
I'm excited for today.

30:57.986 --> 31:00.728
I think we're going
to feed the cow.

31:00.771 --> 31:04.340
Come on, Ebie.
Let's go feed the cow.

31:04.384 --> 31:05.864
Have fun.

31:05.907 --> 31:08.214
You know how quiet
it's about to be in here?

31:17.571 --> 31:19.486
Okay. So we have to put it
to 130 over here.

31:19.529 --> 31:20.748
Yep.

31:20.791 --> 31:22.706
And that is
condensed milk for you.

31:22.750 --> 31:25.318
Did anybody order
a chai latte?

31:25.361 --> 31:27.276
Lookit, this is so fun.

31:27.320 --> 31:31.237
Oh, my latte!
Ew, disgusting.

31:34.022 --> 31:36.198
Come on, we got your nipple.

31:36.242 --> 31:37.765
Let's do the milk right now.

31:37.808 --> 31:40.028
I don't know guys,
I'm terrified a bit.

31:40.072 --> 31:42.422
Let's do it, Tay.

31:42.465 --> 31:46.208
You stay on this side in case
the cow tries to attack us.

31:46.252 --> 31:48.471
She's like don't mess
with my baby.

31:48.515 --> 31:49.690
- Very good.
- Oh.

31:49.733 --> 31:50.909
Ooh.

31:50.952 --> 31:51.953
I don't know if this is good.

31:51.997 --> 31:53.520
I don't like that look.

31:53.563 --> 31:55.087
What are you supposed to do?
Stand still?

31:55.130 --> 31:56.827
- Oh.
- Oh, she ramming.

31:56.871 --> 31:58.394
Oh. Oh, she ramming up.
She's ramming up.

31:58.438 --> 31:59.743
She's about to charge.

31:59.787 --> 32:01.484
I will hop this fence.

32:01.528 --> 32:03.399
I'm definitely no cowgirl.

32:03.443 --> 32:04.531
Oh, my God.

32:04.574 --> 32:06.141
Like, I can't
with this cow.

32:06.185 --> 32:09.101
I for sure thought I was
a lot more gangster than this.

32:11.103 --> 32:12.843
All right, guys.
I think we were good.

32:12.887 --> 32:14.541
We're in the clear.
Come on.

32:14.584 --> 32:17.587
Hi, my lovely baby.

32:17.631 --> 32:20.764
Let's hurry up.
It's okay.

32:20.808 --> 32:23.637
Come on. You gotta eat.
You gotta eat.

32:23.680 --> 32:24.594
- Ready?
- Yeah.

32:24.638 --> 32:25.944
Okay. Okay.

32:25.987 --> 32:27.771
Don't be scared, y'all,
it's only a day old.

32:30.992 --> 32:35.301
Good job. Good job.
You got it. Good job.

32:35.344 --> 32:37.738
- Good baby.
- Good baby.

32:37.781 --> 32:39.827
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

32:39.870 --> 32:41.698
Look up.

32:41.742 --> 32:42.873
- Looking good.
- I can't.

32:42.917 --> 32:44.005
Oh my goodness.

32:44.049 --> 32:46.355
Good job, baby.

32:46.399 --> 32:50.142
- Aww, aww.
- Here we go, here we go.

32:50.185 --> 32:53.232
Just knowing that you're
the one feeding it

32:53.275 --> 32:56.017
and making sure it's getting
the nutrients that it needs,

32:56.061 --> 32:58.019
I thought that was
amazingly rewarding.

32:58.063 --> 32:59.629
- Beautiful, great job.
- Oh, good job.

32:59.673 --> 33:00.935
Good job, my love.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.284
- Good job buddy.
- Good job buddy.

33:02.328 --> 33:04.808
- Good job, buddy.
- Oh, it's wagging its tail.

33:04.852 --> 33:05.896
When a dog does that,
it's happy.

33:05.940 --> 33:07.898
Yeah.

33:07.942 --> 33:09.639
- That was great.
- That was great, you guys.

33:09.683 --> 33:11.511
- That was great.
- That was liberating. Wow.

33:11.554 --> 33:13.600
So lit.
Took the words out my mouth.

33:13.643 --> 33:14.688
Oh, my God, that was great.

33:14.731 --> 33:16.516
Oh my gosh, you guys,
good job.

33:18.866 --> 33:20.911
♪ Gotta let it go

33:20.955 --> 33:22.870
♪ Like a boat
out on the water ♪

33:22.913 --> 33:24.828
♪ Let me catch my breath

33:27.875 --> 33:31.400
Woo.
Oh, I'm so thirsty.

33:46.676 --> 33:49.027
Oh, that's so sick.
The hammock's so sick.

33:49.070 --> 33:51.333
I know.
Austin's hogging it.

33:51.377 --> 33:54.510
- Are you sleeping?
- Oh, he's in it?

33:54.554 --> 33:58.645
You should pour water on him.
I dare you. Pour water on him.

34:01.213 --> 34:02.692
Oh, try it.

34:15.488 --> 34:19.666
He knew, he knew.

34:19.709 --> 34:22.190
Is he still there?
Oh, he left.

34:22.234 --> 34:25.454
Harry?

34:25.498 --> 34:26.760
Oh, my God.

34:26.803 --> 34:28.327
Harry, what is going on?

34:28.370 --> 34:30.546
You have
the strangest relationship.

34:33.897 --> 34:35.986
Where is Harry?

34:39.425 --> 34:43.211
Oh, you

34:43.255 --> 34:46.040
Don't wet my stuff!
Don't wet my stuff!

34:46.084 --> 34:47.607
I swear to God I'll fight you.

34:47.650 --> 34:50.827
Austin!

34:50.871 --> 34:53.352
- Austin.
- Austin.

34:53.395 --> 34:54.744
- You ruined mine.
- Look what you did.

34:54.788 --> 34:56.050
What?

34:56.094 --> 34:57.530
Look, you just dumped water
on her.

35:00.098 --> 35:02.752
You got me, I got you back.
Like what?

35:02.796 --> 35:04.145
There would've been
another moment to get Harry

35:04.189 --> 35:06.234
if you needed to,
but to put her in it?

35:06.278 --> 35:07.844
Am I the bad guy
in this situation?

35:07.888 --> 35:11.457
No, I'm just saying come on,
you got it on her too.

35:14.155 --> 35:15.635
Like nobody thinks
you're a villain.

35:15.678 --> 35:17.419
Don't take it so hard.

35:17.463 --> 35:19.552
I was just having a nap and I
get water thrown on me.

35:19.595 --> 35:20.596
Yeah. That's fair.

35:20.640 --> 35:21.641
Guess who it is?
Harry, like--

35:21.684 --> 35:22.816
And I would be frustrated,
too.

35:22.859 --> 35:25.123
So I hear--I hear you on that.

35:25.166 --> 35:28.952
Guess who the
bad guy is. Moi.

35:28.996 --> 35:30.693
Always, always the bad guy.

35:30.737 --> 35:33.000
If he keeps doing it,
I'm gonna--I'm gonna retaliate.

35:33.043 --> 35:34.175
Okay.

35:34.219 --> 35:36.177
I'm done with that

35:36.221 --> 35:38.136
Here, does my hair
look crazy?

35:38.179 --> 35:40.138
I need to wash it now.
It's all wet.

35:40.181 --> 35:42.923
Oh,
Sorry. You okay?

35:42.966 --> 35:44.185
Yeah.

35:44.229 --> 35:45.143
Where is it?

35:47.493 --> 35:52.454
touched me.

35:54.021 --> 35:56.154
- Harry.
- Yo.

35:56.197 --> 35:58.852
Stop with me.

35:58.895 --> 36:02.160
Like stop doing it.

36:02.203 --> 36:04.640
The funny jokes are like fine
and like like that.

36:04.684 --> 36:07.817
But like when--
just stop with me.

36:07.861 --> 36:10.124
Okay. You wanna be serious?
We'll be serious.

36:10.168 --> 36:12.213
You thought it was funny
five minutes ago

36:12.257 --> 36:13.606
and you thought it was cool.

36:13.649 --> 36:15.173
- No, I'm serious.
- But now that everyone's mad

36:15.216 --> 36:16.565
because you're the [bleep],
you're mad at me.

36:16.609 --> 36:17.653
I'm cool with it.
I'm mad at you.

36:17.697 --> 36:18.959
But I don't care.
Yeah, you are.

36:19.002 --> 36:20.352
I'm not mad at you.
No, I'm not.

36:20.395 --> 36:22.484
I didn't think Austin
would be this ridiculous.

36:22.528 --> 36:24.182
You throw one little thing
at him

36:24.225 --> 36:26.009
and he puffs up his muscles.

36:26.053 --> 36:29.839
He gets, you know, all locked
and tense and all that stuff.

36:29.883 --> 36:32.059
That's weird.

36:32.102 --> 36:33.974
The thing I'm saying is--

36:34.017 --> 36:34.931
I don't care what
you're saying.

36:34.975 --> 36:36.237
I don't what you're saying.

36:36.281 --> 36:37.325
You might as well walk away
at this point.

36:37.369 --> 36:39.022
- Yeah. I will.
- Walk away.

36:39.066 --> 36:40.850
You with me one more
time, I will hit you.

36:40.894 --> 36:42.112
- Go for it.
- Guarantee.

36:42.156 --> 36:43.984
- Go for it.
- Guarantee. Try it.

36:44.027 --> 36:46.508
- You don't scare me.
- I don't need to scare you.

36:46.552 --> 36:48.510
I'm just letting you know
what will happen.

36:59.521 --> 37:03.438
All right, guys. Hurry up.

37:07.529 --> 37:08.965
Easy, bud.

37:11.316 --> 37:13.666
- Hey guys, how you feeling?
- Good. How are you doing?

37:13.709 --> 37:16.146
- Sleepy.
- You all ready to go again?

37:16.190 --> 37:17.496
- Yes.
- Yeah.

37:17.539 --> 37:19.193
We have someone new
joining us today.

37:19.237 --> 37:20.325
Hi.

37:20.368 --> 37:22.022
Her name's Makayla.

37:22.065 --> 37:24.981
She is one of the ranch owners,
Jerad's daughter.

37:25.025 --> 37:27.767
- Oh, right, hey Makayla.
- Nice. All right.

37:27.810 --> 37:29.377
Today we're gonna get you
back on your horse

37:29.421 --> 37:32.119
and kind of advance
and get you more comfortable.

37:32.162 --> 37:35.253
And Ebie, we actually have a
new friend to introduce you to.

37:35.296 --> 37:37.298
Woo!

37:37.342 --> 37:39.692
Smokey had an attitude
and we were just clashing.

37:39.735 --> 37:41.041
It was not working.

37:41.084 --> 37:43.348
Ooh, I don't like that.

37:43.391 --> 37:46.568
We're gonna get you all on
your horses at the same time.

37:46.612 --> 37:48.309
And we're gonna kind of walk

37:48.353 --> 37:51.138
around in the arena together,
so come on in.

37:51.181 --> 37:52.661
Oh.

37:52.705 --> 37:57.187
Oh, I can't wait this jump,
okay. All right.

37:57.231 --> 37:59.233
Who's next?

37:59.277 --> 38:00.365
Oh, Redmond.

38:00.408 --> 38:01.627
Yeah.

38:02.976 --> 38:06.588
- Yee-haw.
- Go girl.

38:12.333 --> 38:13.943
You're completely out
of your element.

38:13.987 --> 38:18.034
- Yes.
- Yes. Okay. Ebie. This is Ty.

38:18.078 --> 38:20.036
- Hello?
- Yeah. Come say hi.

38:20.080 --> 38:21.864
- Hi.
- You can do this.

38:21.908 --> 38:23.692
Remember, touch here.

38:23.736 --> 38:25.738
Hi. I get scared.
I don't know why.

38:25.781 --> 38:27.957
- That's okay. He's big.
- I know.

38:28.001 --> 38:29.524
So look how chill he is.
He's doing great.

38:29.568 --> 38:32.266
But when you're comfortable,
let me know, we'll get you on.

38:32.310 --> 38:33.615
Okay. We could try.

38:33.659 --> 38:35.138
- Yep.
- Here we go.

38:35.182 --> 38:37.445
Uh-oh.
My boobies, they popped out.

38:37.489 --> 38:39.621
- Ain't nothing.
- Okay.

38:39.665 --> 38:41.275
So kick your horse
to go forward.

38:41.319 --> 38:44.713
Okay. We're going. Oops.
We're going this way. Uh-oh.

38:44.757 --> 38:47.107
Okay. Hold on.

38:47.150 --> 38:50.502
Good job. And then go ahead.
Stop.

38:50.545 --> 38:52.765
Good. This way. This way.

38:52.808 --> 38:54.549
Good job. Perfect.

38:54.593 --> 38:56.116
Yeah. Ty.

38:56.159 --> 38:57.683
There you go. That's much
better than yesterday.

38:57.726 --> 39:00.120
- Yeah. Ty.
- That's great. Yeah.

39:00.163 --> 39:02.296
- Yeah, Ebie.
- Better relationship.

39:02.340 --> 39:05.778
Hell yeah.
Ebie is like freaking fire.

39:05.821 --> 39:08.128
I'm out here now.
Mm-hmm.

39:08.171 --> 39:10.826
It's nice to see
improvement in Ebie

39:10.870 --> 39:12.959
because today
she's doing a great job

39:13.002 --> 39:15.657
and I think it's just gonna
only improve from here.

39:15.701 --> 39:18.399
- Better combo.
- Yay, Ebie.

39:18.443 --> 39:21.924
Like honestly, I did not know
I was gonna become a horse girl

39:21.968 --> 39:23.143
and I'm just proud of myself

39:23.186 --> 39:25.145
for making some
sort of progress here.

39:25.188 --> 39:26.973
- There you go, Ebie.
- Good. That's excellent.

39:27.016 --> 39:30.019
- Good boy.
- Go, Harry. Yeah.

39:30.063 --> 39:31.630
- Slowly becoming a pro, baby.
- Oh yeah.

39:31.673 --> 39:32.848
Harry, you're killing it.

39:32.892 --> 39:35.721
- I like my horse.
- Good.

39:35.764 --> 39:40.116
So what this is practicing
is connection, clear thoughts.

39:40.160 --> 39:43.119
And so--
- This is making me nervous.

39:43.163 --> 39:44.991
- Okay. That's fine.
- Good job, everybody.

39:45.034 --> 39:46.862
We're gonna work
on position first.

39:46.906 --> 39:48.995
So you're gonna go
to that end of the arena.

39:49.038 --> 39:50.997
You're gonna talk
to each other.

39:51.040 --> 39:54.479
Try to stay sort of close
with each other.

39:54.522 --> 39:55.610
Oh, sorry.

39:55.654 --> 39:56.785
Y'all look like...

39:56.829 --> 39:58.004
Come on Blue Duck.

39:58.047 --> 40:00.006
Y'all coming into town.

40:00.049 --> 40:02.225
Hey, I don't want
any trouble people. Alright?

40:02.269 --> 40:03.792
Keep going.

40:03.836 --> 40:07.535
There we go. Look at this.
We look like an outlaw gang.

40:07.579 --> 40:09.189
You want to show off.

40:09.232 --> 40:11.452
Man, y'all didn't even
tip your hat. Y'all rude.

40:11.496 --> 40:15.195
Okay. Stop.
How do I make it stop?

40:15.238 --> 40:18.198
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, my God.

40:18.241 --> 40:20.026
Please you don't wanna do that.
Please, please, please.

40:20.069 --> 40:22.463
Sorry. My horse
doesn't hate you.

40:22.507 --> 40:24.552
Erin, how long do
I have to do this?

40:24.596 --> 40:26.206
You're fine.

40:26.249 --> 40:27.642
I don't--I don't want go.
I don't like this.

40:27.686 --> 40:29.688
- You're fine. You're fine.
- I'm trying to get off.

40:29.731 --> 40:31.603
We're gonna go around.

40:31.646 --> 40:32.952
I don't--I'm scared.

40:32.995 --> 40:34.519
This is scary
with everybody riding.

40:34.562 --> 40:37.391
I still don't feel comfortable
with the horse.

40:37.435 --> 40:41.395
I'm not meant to ride horses.
I ride horsepower cars.

40:41.439 --> 40:45.530
Hellcats, not horses.
I'd rather just be in control.

40:45.573 --> 40:48.271
Ah, okay, no, please, please.

40:48.315 --> 40:49.969
No, he's just backing up.
He's just backing up.

40:50.012 --> 40:51.884
Please. Please, stop.
Please. Please. Please.

40:51.927 --> 40:53.973
- He's backing up.
- Oh my gosh.

40:54.016 --> 40:56.541
I thought I was the only one.

40:56.584 --> 40:57.933
Even Ebie looks like

40:57.977 --> 41:00.632
she's ready to ride
horses all day, all night.

41:00.675 --> 41:03.025
You know, it's still gonna be
a little intimidating.

41:03.069 --> 41:05.332
This is just
very overwhelming.

41:05.375 --> 41:08.248
Everybody thought I was
a mess yesterday.

41:10.293 --> 41:13.558
All right, let's go. Come on.

41:13.601 --> 41:15.995
Step down. Okay guys.

41:16.038 --> 41:17.736
Thank you so much,
see you later.

41:17.779 --> 41:19.128
- Bye guys.
- Bye.

41:19.172 --> 41:20.173
Bye.

41:20.216 --> 41:21.566
How do we get out of this?

41:24.003 --> 41:25.657
In terms of like
being out of the city,

41:25.700 --> 41:28.355
I think it's beautiful.
Like I have no problem with it.

41:28.398 --> 41:30.531
'Cause my family
has a ranch in Virginia.

41:30.575 --> 41:33.316
- Oh cool.
- Yeah.

41:33.360 --> 41:36.102
My dad likes to go there after
he films just to like relax.

41:36.145 --> 41:37.277
'Cause it's so peaceful.
- Yeah.

41:37.320 --> 41:39.279
Serene.
Just like get away, you know?

41:39.322 --> 41:41.020
And we didn't
have animals anymore.

41:41.063 --> 41:43.152
We had horses at one point,
but then we sold them.

41:43.196 --> 41:44.850
They take a lot of
upkeep to maintain.

41:44.893 --> 41:46.329
Yeah.
We sold them 'cause

41:46.373 --> 41:48.288
we're like playing basketball,
bowling and all.

41:48.331 --> 41:49.811
- Oh really?
- Yeah. That's what we do.

41:49.855 --> 41:53.293
- Oh, what?
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

41:53.336 --> 41:55.469
I'm not getting used to being
on the ranch at all.

41:55.513 --> 41:57.602
I'm very homesick.
I miss my girlfriend.

41:57.645 --> 42:01.997
I miss my family.
I miss having my own space.

42:02.041 --> 42:04.609
Oh my gosh.
I'm freezing.

42:04.652 --> 42:07.307
And I don't like doing
these jobs, just to be honest.

42:16.446 --> 42:20.886
This week was hard.
Oh, my God. To be honest, bro.

42:20.929 --> 42:24.629
I'm ready to go.
I definitely was not meant

42:24.672 --> 42:27.849
to work on a ranch
or be in this environment.

42:32.767 --> 42:35.335
I'm leaning on the no side.

42:35.378 --> 42:37.163
You come out here
and do this work and see how--

42:37.206 --> 42:38.338
see how easy it is.

42:38.381 --> 42:40.819
You can't.
It's hard. It's nasty.

42:40.862 --> 42:43.299
It's gross out here. I hate it.

42:43.343 --> 42:46.564
I'm done with this

42:46.607 --> 42:51.307
I can't do this
type of work, bro.

42:55.224 --> 42:58.488
Next time on "Relatively
Ranch Rules."

42:58.532 --> 43:01.753
You guys are gonna be
reshoeing your horses here.

43:01.796 --> 43:05.017
Oh,

43:05.060 --> 43:07.367
Started hitting my limits.

43:07.410 --> 43:08.542
Can you help me
with my tanning stuff?

43:08.586 --> 43:09.804
Yeah, baby.

43:09.848 --> 43:11.893
Can't go on a date
looking pale and gross.

43:11.937 --> 43:14.635
He looks like a Oompa Loompa.

43:14.679 --> 43:16.115
Geez.

43:16.158 --> 43:18.030
Hey, Hana and Austin,
don't have any kids on us.

43:18.073 --> 43:19.205
Not while we're here.

43:19.248 --> 43:20.554
All right.
Can I just be honest?

43:20.598 --> 43:22.687
It seems like
Austin's into Tay.

43:25.472 --> 43:26.995
Stop saying
this to be tough.

43:27.039 --> 43:28.954
Take control of your
girl.

43:28.997 --> 43:30.651
- I got him, I got him.
- Uh-oh, uh-oh.

43:30.695 --> 43:32.218
I got him, I got him.

43:32.261 --> 43:33.262
- You piece of
- I got him. I got him.

43:33.306 --> 43:34.568
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.
