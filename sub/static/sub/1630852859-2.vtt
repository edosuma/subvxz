00:01.201 --> 00:02.801
<i>[Shauna] Previously on
I Am Shauna Rae...</i>

00:02.803 --> 00:04.069
[all cheering]

00:04.071 --> 00:05.137
<i>[Shauna] If you
were to look at me,</i>

00:05.139 --> 00:07.006
<i>you would think I'm just
a normal little girl,</i>

00:07.008 --> 00:10.509
<i>doing normal little girl things
with my fun, crazy family.</i>

00:10.511 --> 00:12.978
[Patricia] Yeah, Shauna!
Keep going, Shauna!

00:12.980 --> 00:14.913
But the truth is,
I'm not a little girl.

00:14.915 --> 00:17.750
<i>I'm a woman,
a 22-year-old woman.</i>

00:17.752 --> 00:21.053
Stuck in the body
of an eight year old.

00:21.055 --> 00:25.124
<i>When I was six months old, my mom
noticed a bump in the back of my head.</i>

00:25.126 --> 00:27.826
The doctors said it was a tumor.

00:27.828 --> 00:29.995
A very aggressive,
cancerous tumor.

00:29.997 --> 00:34.933
<i>The chemotherapy rendered
my pituitary gland almost dormant</i>

00:34.935 --> 00:38.037
and because of that my
height is 3 feet and 10 inches.

00:38.972 --> 00:40.172
I'm not tall enough!

00:40.174 --> 00:41.640
[Patricia] She's
3 inch... 3' 10".

00:41.642 --> 00:43.142
<i>[Shauna] When it comes
to amusement parks,</i>

00:43.144 --> 00:46.011
the height restriction thing,
it is really difficult

00:46.013 --> 00:49.148
because it takes away
my sense of independence.

00:49.150 --> 00:51.150
I hate bumper cars
for this exact reason.

00:51.152 --> 00:54.420
<i>When my parents hear about
me talking about independence</i>

00:54.422 --> 00:55.954
my mom gets worried.

00:56.356 --> 00:57.423
[bleep]

00:57.924 --> 00:59.191
[Mark laughing]

00:59.193 --> 01:01.794
Worrying about her
is a normal parent thing,

01:01.796 --> 01:03.028
but it's elevated.

01:03.030 --> 01:05.531
You just can't
ensure her safety.

01:05.533 --> 01:07.032
What are we gonna
say in your bio?

01:07.034 --> 01:09.868
My romantic life kinda sucks.

01:09.870 --> 01:11.970
I'm short. Leave me alone.

01:11.972 --> 01:15.240
I attract creeps,
[bleep] and idiots.

01:15.242 --> 01:16.975
Michael looks cute.

01:16.977 --> 01:18.977
He can't spell Connecticut.

01:18.979 --> 01:20.546
He did put a Q in Connecticut.

01:20.548 --> 01:22.347
<i>[Mark] The problem
with online is</i>

01:22.349 --> 01:25.984
you don't know
what their intentions are.

01:25.986 --> 01:27.086
Oh, we need photos.

01:27.088 --> 01:28.921
<i>[Shauna] It is scary
to put myself out there but,</i>

01:28.923 --> 01:32.424
you have to put
some risk in to get happiness.

01:44.037 --> 01:45.804
-[Joel] Hi. How are you?
-Good, how are you?

01:45.806 --> 01:47.239
Good, how can we help you?

01:47.241 --> 01:49.007
<i>[Shauna] It's hard being
trapped in an eight year old's body</i>

01:49.009 --> 01:50.909
when you wanna be
treated like an adult.

01:50.911 --> 01:54.046
Having tattoos shows people
that I'm not a child.

01:54.048 --> 01:57.282
<i>So, today I'm going
to a tattoo shop</i>

01:57.284 --> 02:01.053
to consult with, um, a
tattooer about an idea I have.

02:01.055 --> 02:03.155
I wanna get a tattoo.

02:03.157 --> 02:05.224
You wanna get a tattoo?
What do you have in mind?

02:05.592 --> 02:07.526
I want it right here.

02:07.528 --> 02:10.028
I want a chocolate covered
cherry, not completely covered,

02:10.030 --> 02:12.097
like half-covered,
with the stem.

02:12.099 --> 02:16.335
And then I want, "February
14th, 2021," with "Pap-Pap."

02:16.870 --> 02:18.537
All right, cool. Um...

02:18.539 --> 02:19.805
What's it for, if you
don't mind my asking?

02:19.807 --> 02:21.273
My grandfather passed away

02:21.275 --> 02:23.242
- on Valentine's Day.
- Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.

02:23.244 --> 02:24.543
No, it's okay.

02:24.545 --> 02:27.112
So, the tattoo I wanna get
is for my grandfather

02:27.114 --> 02:28.547
who passed away recently.

02:28.549 --> 02:29.748
<i>He was my mom's father</i>

02:29.750 --> 02:31.683
<i>and "Pap-Pap"
is what we called him.</i>

02:31.685 --> 02:35.020
<i>His favorite candy
was chocolate covered cherries</i>

02:35.022 --> 02:37.256
and that will be
a great representation of him.

02:37.857 --> 02:39.024
Um...

02:39.792 --> 02:41.293
Do you...

02:42.862 --> 02:44.363
If you don't mind my asking,
how old are you?

02:44.365 --> 02:45.531
I'm 22.

02:45.533 --> 02:47.933
Okay. Um...

02:47.935 --> 02:49.134
And you have existing tattoos?

02:49.136 --> 02:50.836
Yeah, I have this one,
right here.

02:50.838 --> 02:54.072
- Okay.
- I have this one right here.

02:54.074 --> 02:56.108
- Mm-hmm. Beautiful.
- That goes across my whole back

02:56.110 --> 02:56.975
and I have one on my ribs.

02:56.977 --> 02:58.243
All right, cool.

02:58.878 --> 03:00.212
Do you wanna come around back?

03:00.214 --> 03:01.780
Maybe we can
sit at the computer,

03:01.782 --> 03:04.183
maybe draw a little design
together a little bit?

03:04.185 --> 03:05.250
I'm okay with
whatever you wanna do.

03:05.252 --> 03:06.852
See if we can figure it out?

03:06.854 --> 03:08.387
- Come on back.
- Thank you.

03:08.389 --> 03:10.989
<i>So, walking into a tattoo shop,</i>

03:10.991 --> 03:12.658
<i>it's a strange feeling.</i>

03:12.660 --> 03:14.493
It's almost like
walking into a bar.

03:14.495 --> 03:16.762
You're either
gonna get carded or not.

03:16.764 --> 03:19.998
<i>And either they have
respect for you or they don't.</i>

03:20.000 --> 03:22.701
And even though
it's a different circumstance,

03:22.703 --> 03:24.770
it's a very similar feeling.

03:24.772 --> 03:28.106
All right, so, I guess one of
the challenges is gonna be...

03:28.108 --> 03:30.909
- My proportions?
- Size and proportions.

03:30.911 --> 03:33.245
Let's just draw just a little...

03:35.048 --> 03:36.315
- You okay?
- Yeah.

03:38.685 --> 03:40.152
[Shauna laughs]

03:44.791 --> 03:47.526
Sometimes being big has nothing
to do with how big you really are.

03:47.528 --> 03:50.028
Yeah, I have the personality
to make up for it, so...

03:50.030 --> 03:51.563
- Something tells me...
- [Shauna laughs]

03:51.565 --> 03:53.031
I believe you. I believe you.

03:53.399 --> 03:55.033
<i>[Joel] I mean, obviously when
you first meet somebody like that</i>

03:55.035 --> 03:56.868
you're a little bit taken aback,

03:56.870 --> 03:58.837
but once she opened up her
mouth and verbalized herself,

03:58.839 --> 04:00.239
she's a firecracker.

04:00.241 --> 04:01.540
She's a lot of fun.
I'd like to hang out with her.

04:05.144 --> 04:06.245
Yeah.

04:09.315 --> 04:11.149
- Yeah.
- You know?

04:13.920 --> 04:14.953
[Joel] Yeah.

04:14.955 --> 04:18.757
I can relate to Joel because
he has gone through

04:18.759 --> 04:22.127
the same kind of
pre-judgmental experiences

04:22.129 --> 04:23.895
that I have gone through,
but on the opposite spectrum.

04:23.897 --> 04:28.100
<i>He's taller, he's a wider
person, he's covered in tattoos.</i>

04:28.102 --> 04:30.736
And those are all stereotypes
for someone would could hurt you.

04:30.738 --> 04:32.170
I mean, him being told,

04:32.172 --> 04:34.640
"Oh, I don't want your help,"
because of the way he looks

04:34.642 --> 04:35.741
or me being told,

04:35.743 --> 04:37.943
"Oh, no, honey,
you can't pour my coffee,"

04:37.945 --> 04:39.144
is kinda the same feeling

04:39.146 --> 04:41.847
it's like, "Well,
why am I not good enough?"

04:41.849 --> 04:43.749
[Joel] How do you feel
about something like this,

04:43.751 --> 04:45.117
where you can see the molten?

04:45.119 --> 04:47.719
Or do you want it just kinda,
like, dunked in chocolate?

04:47.721 --> 04:50.789
Um, the dunked in chocolate
might be better

04:50.791 --> 04:52.391
because, I've
looked it up and...

04:56.829 --> 04:58.997
- So...
- Okay, I could see that.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.499
The only reason I was kinda
lending myself to that

05:00.501 --> 05:03.035
is because I can turn that
almost into a little bit of a heart.

05:03.037 --> 05:05.370
If you wanna do that without
making it look inappropriate,

05:05.372 --> 05:07.172
- I'm all for it.
- 'Kay.

05:07.174 --> 05:09.174
Because he actually did prefer
these kind which are the filled kind.

05:09.176 --> 05:09.775
Oh, those are the best.

05:09.777 --> 05:11.176
- Yeah.
- All right.

05:11.178 --> 05:15.180
<i>[Shauna] So, I specifically
wanted a certain kind of cherry</i>

05:15.182 --> 05:17.082
because cherries
can be sexualized.

05:17.084 --> 05:19.951
And, the bitten in one,
you get it tattooed,

05:19.953 --> 05:22.020
it's gonna look like semen.

05:22.022 --> 05:24.723
And I don't want that
on my arm. [laughs]

05:24.725 --> 05:27.192
So, I just wanna stick
to one cherry,

05:27.194 --> 05:30.696
one whole cherry,
covered in chocolate.

05:30.698 --> 05:31.997
If you don't mind my asking,

05:31.999 --> 05:33.632
how old was your grandfather
when he passed?

05:33.634 --> 05:36.902
Uh, I think he was around 76.

05:36.904 --> 05:41.807
He had, um, stage 4 lung
cancer for about nine years.

05:41.809 --> 05:44.910
So, the reason
I'm getting the tattoo

05:44.912 --> 05:47.145
is because he did pass away
and he was very...

05:47.147 --> 05:48.747
Big part of your life?

05:48.749 --> 05:52.184
I wouldn't say big,
like, involvement-wise,

05:52.186 --> 05:55.053
but he always
made sure that no one

05:55.055 --> 05:59.124
- was an [bleep] to me because of my height.
- Gotcha, gotcha.

05:59.126 --> 06:01.727
<i>[Shauna] When it came
to my grandfather,</i>

06:01.729 --> 06:03.228
<i>there was a connection there.</i>

06:03.230 --> 06:06.064
<i>When we went there, he
always wanted to talk to me</i>

06:06.066 --> 06:08.300
<i>and he went out of his way</i>

06:08.302 --> 06:11.203
to do things for... For me.

06:11.537 --> 06:12.437
And...

06:13.506 --> 06:14.840
He was the only one,

06:14.842 --> 06:18.710
really, that, on my mom's
extended family's side,

06:18.712 --> 06:21.880
that didn't look at my height,
and make me feel different.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.115
Because I was his granddaughter.

06:23.117 --> 06:25.016
[sniffles]

06:25.018 --> 06:29.287
And that... It was the...
He just made me feel amazing.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.290
So, I mean, this would be like
the first general mockup.

06:32.292 --> 06:35.861
How do you feel
about making one of the As

06:35.863 --> 06:36.928
the actual cherry?

06:36.930 --> 06:37.929
Oh, that would work better.

06:37.931 --> 06:38.997
- Yep.
- How's that? That's cool?

06:38.999 --> 06:41.400
- So, we'll...
- Plus, it'll take up less space.

06:41.402 --> 06:44.136
Yeah. We'll scrap this guy, and
we'll do another one real quick.

06:44.138 --> 06:45.971
<i>[Shauna] Each of my tattoos
have a meaning.</i>

06:45.973 --> 06:48.073
I never wanna get a tattoo
without a meaning.

06:48.075 --> 06:51.276
<i>The first one is for my cancer.</i>

06:51.278 --> 06:54.012
<i>It's two elephants
making the cancer symbol.</i>

06:54.014 --> 06:55.847
And this one, on my forearm,

06:55.849 --> 06:58.383
<i>is two doves facing each other.</i>

07:03.222 --> 07:07.025
The one on my ribs is just
a stencil of a polar bear.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.527
<i>It's my favorite animal.</i>

07:08.529 --> 07:11.763
And I think I'm like a polar
bear because they look

07:11.765 --> 07:16.568
so cute and cuddly, but they
actually are so, like, "introverted"

07:16.570 --> 07:19.171
because they don't see
other polar bears, um,

07:19.173 --> 07:23.074
that they will attack any
other polar bear they see.

07:23.076 --> 07:27.212
So I think I'm the same way
with humans.

07:27.214 --> 07:29.748
Shauna's like a polar bear
'cause, you know, she's cute

07:29.750 --> 07:32.217
and she, she seems very sweet.

07:32.219 --> 07:35.253
But she can just devastate you.

07:35.255 --> 07:37.355
- She's ferocious.
- With one swipe.

07:37.857 --> 07:38.924
- Arrr.
- Arrr.

07:38.926 --> 07:41.026
[both laughing]

07:41.028 --> 07:43.061
- How many tattoos do you have?
- One big one.

07:43.063 --> 07:45.030
- Just one massive...
- [laughing] Yeah.

07:45.032 --> 07:47.098
- At this point, I've never...
- Did it start out that way?

07:47.100 --> 07:50.202
Um, no. I got my first tattoo
on my 18th birthday.

07:50.204 --> 07:51.837
My mom wasn't
very happy about it,

07:51.839 --> 07:53.772
but it's a lot more
acceptable now...

07:53.774 --> 07:55.106
- Yeah.
- than it used to be back then, so...

07:55.108 --> 07:56.975
That's how my mom is.
My mom's like,

07:56.977 --> 07:59.644
"Well, you're, you're tiny
and you already curse,

07:59.646 --> 08:02.113
and you already drag
attention to you,

08:02.115 --> 08:05.584
and now you're gonna get a tattoo, and people
are gonna stare at you and point at it."

08:05.586 --> 08:08.520
And I'm like, "But I want it."

08:08.522 --> 08:12.457
<i>I think my first tattoo was a
connection to independence in a way.</i>

08:12.459 --> 08:16.127
Setting my personality
almost with my mom.

08:16.129 --> 08:19.264
Because I had to convince her
that it was going to be okay

08:19.266 --> 08:21.700
even though it's on
a childlike body that...

08:21.702 --> 08:23.802
I understand.
I might get judgement.

08:23.804 --> 08:28.039
But I've gotten judgement my entire
life, so why can't I do what I wanna do?

08:28.041 --> 08:30.609
[Joel] Um, how do you like
the idea of something like that?

08:30.611 --> 08:32.944
I do like that sketch.
Um, where's...

08:32.946 --> 08:34.746
- You wanna see the first one?
- [Shauna] Yeah.

08:34.748 --> 08:36.882
- You got it, right there.
- Honestly, if I could just take this home

08:36.884 --> 08:39.818
and show it to my parents
because it is for my mother,

08:39.820 --> 08:40.785
at the end of the day,
'cause it is her dad.

08:40.787 --> 08:42.921
Gotcha. Take this, show it
to your family,

08:42.923 --> 08:45.590
and if you have any questions,
or anything that you want me to do

08:45.592 --> 08:46.992
or change, whatever,
just let me know.

08:46.994 --> 08:49.261
I'm open to changing it and
it's all about you. You know?

08:49.263 --> 08:51.329
-Mm.
-I'll walk you out. Do you want a T-shirt?

08:51.331 --> 08:52.831
Sure, I'll take free stuff.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.532
[Joel chuckling]

08:54.800 --> 08:57.669
<i>[Joel] Every person presents themselves
with a different set of complexities,</i>

08:57.671 --> 09:00.739
but her willingness to verbalize
what she does and does not want

09:00.741 --> 09:02.307
allows me to really get
a good handle

09:02.309 --> 09:04.943
<i>on what's actually possible
with her anatomy.</i>

09:04.945 --> 09:09.314
<i>She's not asking for anything that's hard
to do or would complicate anything at all</i>

09:09.316 --> 09:10.348
so, she's, she's good.

09:10.350 --> 09:11.616
I can't wait to do it.

09:11.618 --> 09:13.552
[Joel] When you figure out
what you wanna do, let me know.

09:13.554 --> 09:16.021
- Yup, I'm sure we will see you in the future.
- I'll walk you out.

09:16.023 --> 09:18.823
- Give you a card, and you can give us a call.
- Thank you.

09:18.825 --> 09:21.660
<i>The tattoo consultation
with Big Joel went really well.</i>

09:21.662 --> 09:23.995
<i>I do plan on coming back
soon for my tattoo.</i>

09:23.997 --> 09:27.198
<i>I also plan on taking
my mother to get this tattoo.</i>

09:27.200 --> 09:30.936
She's not the biggest fan
of my tattoos, but it's for her

09:30.938 --> 09:32.337
so I hope she'll change
her mind.

09:42.848 --> 09:43.515
Puppies.

09:44.016 --> 09:45.350
Where you going?

09:45.352 --> 09:47.118
I'm going to the brewery.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.821
- Going to a brewery?
- Yeah.

09:49.823 --> 09:52.824
My friends and I are going
to a local brewery.

09:52.826 --> 09:56.227
And we're gonna go try,
I don't know, beers, cider...

09:56.229 --> 09:58.163
We're just gonna go have fun.

09:58.165 --> 09:59.831
Who are you going
to a brewery with?

09:59.833 --> 10:01.266
Naiyh and Edric.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.634
And who are they?

10:02.636 --> 10:03.768
You know Naiyh.

10:03.770 --> 10:06.204
- I do?
- Yeah, Naiyh used to work for Mom.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.872
And Edric is her boyfriend.

10:07.874 --> 10:10.275
All right. Nobody else
is gonna be there?

10:10.277 --> 10:12.544
- No.
- And when you gonna be back?

10:14.380 --> 10:16.648
Not, like, by...

10:16.650 --> 10:18.516
- I'm thinking latest...
- By tomorrow?

10:18.518 --> 10:20.118
No, I'm thinking latest
like 3:00.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.253
Okay. Who's driving?

10:22.255 --> 10:24.556
- Probably Edric because...
- Does he not drink?

10:24.957 --> 10:26.958
One of them
usually doesn't drink.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.995
'Cause, like, they'll switch. Edric
won't drink, Naiyh won't drink...

10:29.997 --> 10:31.763
Text me the name of the brewery.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.965
- Okay. Can I?
- So I know where it is.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.401
But can I go now?
'Cause she's here now.

10:36.403 --> 10:38.970
- Be careful.
- Thank you.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.740
<i>[Shauna] Every time I leave the
house, my parents do ask me questions.</i>

10:41.742 --> 10:44.676
<i>I'm used to it,
but I wish it would stop.</i>

10:44.678 --> 10:47.612
My mom is probably the worst
with the questions.

10:47.614 --> 10:49.514
<i>And I, I tell her to let me do
what I want</i>

10:49.516 --> 10:51.516
<i>and that I'm an adult,
and she understands.</i>

10:51.518 --> 10:55.453
But my mom, I'm like the child
that never grew up in her eyes.

10:56.822 --> 10:58.657
- [Shauna] Can you unlock it?
- No.

10:58.659 --> 11:01.526
[laughing] I'm just kidding,
come in!

11:01.528 --> 11:03.962
You'll just go to the brewery
without me.

11:04.830 --> 11:07.332
- Let's roll.
- So how are y'all?

11:07.334 --> 11:09.567
- We're good, how are you?
- I'm okay.

11:09.569 --> 11:11.002
Tired, but I'm okay.

11:11.004 --> 11:14.039
<i>[Patty] When it comes to
Shauna and her independence,</i>

11:14.041 --> 11:17.175
<i>I know with everything in me
that I should...</i>

11:17.877 --> 11:19.210
Give a little more.

11:19.545 --> 11:25.250
And I really try and tell myself
on a daily basis to do that.

11:25.851 --> 11:26.951
[sighs] I just can't.

11:26.953 --> 11:30.822
Realistically, you have
to adjust

11:30.824 --> 11:32.957
to the fact that I'm going
to do what I want,

11:32.959 --> 11:36.361
and that you can't always
get your way.

11:39.699 --> 11:43.068
So, do y'all have any advice
for me, knowing my family,

11:43.070 --> 11:46.037
knowing what needs to get
done in my life?

11:46.039 --> 11:48.640
I mean, you don't live at home
'cause of college right now.

11:48.642 --> 11:50.542
Edric, do you live at home?

11:50.544 --> 11:52.243
No, I moved out
recently, actually.

11:52.245 --> 11:53.611
Oh, wow. So what was
that like?

11:53.613 --> 11:55.146
Amazing.

11:55.148 --> 11:59.951
I don't have to deal with my, my
mom nagging at me now and then.

11:59.953 --> 12:01.886
When it comes to me moving out,

12:01.888 --> 12:03.088
it depends on my mom.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.122
I mean, you know my mom.

12:04.124 --> 12:05.924
- And...
- Yeah.

12:05.926 --> 12:07.192
She's very,
very protective of me.

12:07.194 --> 12:08.893
So this is their goal.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.461
They're gonna buy a house,

12:10.463 --> 12:13.832
and then there's gonna be like an
addition on the house or next to the house,

12:13.834 --> 12:15.467
- and that's where I'm gonna live.
- [Naiyh] No.

12:17.703 --> 12:18.703
Yeah, definitely.

12:18.705 --> 12:20.905
<i>[Shauna] I think
Naiyh's reaction...</i>

12:20.907 --> 12:23.475
<i>She understands that I need
that independence.</i>

12:23.477 --> 12:25.343
She knows my mom personally.

12:25.345 --> 12:28.713
<i>And she sees how much my
mom has tightened the reins on me</i>

12:28.715 --> 12:29.881
<i>versus my other sisters.</i>

12:29.883 --> 12:31.983
It's a very tricky situation
because I want to be

12:31.985 --> 12:34.886
fully independent
at one point in my life,

12:34.888 --> 12:37.989
and I don't think I ever will be
with my mother and my stepfather.

12:37.991 --> 12:41.025
<i>So, when I tell my parents
that I'm moving out,</i>

12:41.027 --> 12:43.194
I don't think that it will
go over well.

12:44.964 --> 12:46.064
How's school?

12:46.131 --> 12:47.899
Ugh, so stressful.

12:47.901 --> 12:52.003
Maybe in the beginning I
started vaping to look older.

12:52.005 --> 12:55.840
I've always been attracted
to an edgy kinda lifestyle

12:55.842 --> 12:58.009
with the tattoos,
the piercing...

12:58.011 --> 12:59.544
Were you thinking
about a boyfriend?

12:59.546 --> 13:00.545
I mean...

13:00.547 --> 13:02.180
<i>With my sister getting married,</i>

13:02.182 --> 13:03.748
and my friends talking
about their life,

13:03.750 --> 13:06.684
I'm starting to think
more about my dating life.

13:06.686 --> 13:09.754
My sister has done online
dating for me and stuff, but, like,

13:09.756 --> 13:12.457
it's different when you're
in my situation.

13:23.135 --> 13:26.337
- Oh, wow. Look at this entrance, Shauna.
- I know.

13:27.506 --> 13:29.774
<i>[Shauna] We just arrived
at Jamesport, New York,</i>

13:29.776 --> 13:31.776
<i>and my good friends,
Naiyh, Edric and I,</i>

13:31.778 --> 13:33.311
<i>are heading
to an outdoor brewery.</i>

13:33.313 --> 13:35.180
So now it's time to drink.

13:35.182 --> 13:36.114
[woman]
How you doing, guys?

13:36.116 --> 13:37.982
- Hey, how are you?
- Good.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.685
- Have you guys been here before?
- [all] No.

13:40.687 --> 13:42.754
So, we brew
all of our beers here.

13:42.756 --> 13:45.089
On the back, we have some
local wines and brunch cocktails,

13:45.091 --> 13:46.257
if you're not beer drinkers.

13:46.259 --> 13:47.025
[Shauna]
They have cider right?

13:47.027 --> 13:48.726
Yeah, and ciders.

13:48.728 --> 13:53.531
When I drink alcohol-- I'm
not a big wine or beer person,

13:53.533 --> 13:55.233
I'm more of
a hard liquor person,

13:55.235 --> 13:58.736
but, like, hard liquor with
something else in it, most of the time.

13:58.738 --> 14:01.239
Unless, it's just shots,
then it's shots.

14:01.241 --> 14:03.208
- Can I get a cider?
- Yeah, of course.

14:03.210 --> 14:04.809
[Naiyh] I'll try
a cider, as well.

14:04.811 --> 14:06.177
- Okay.
- Yeah.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.545
[Edric] I'll do cider too.
Just give me a cider.

14:07.547 --> 14:08.980
- Three ciders?
- Three ciders, please.

14:08.982 --> 14:11.049
- Thank you.
- [Shauna] Take it easy.

14:11.051 --> 14:14.152
<i>[woman] So, I was surprised
by the group that came in</i>

14:14.154 --> 14:18.590
just because one of the women
looked pretty young,

14:18.592 --> 14:21.125
super tiny. I thought
she was eight years old.

14:24.864 --> 14:28.967
That's insane to me because,
um, I mean, how tall is she?

14:28.969 --> 14:30.335
Like, two feet?

14:31.003 --> 14:33.171
- Here, give me two.
- Here, you want it?

14:33.173 --> 14:35.473
- 'Cause I spilled it.
- Oh, come get it.

14:36.275 --> 14:37.775
- Come get it. [laughs]
- Yeah.

14:37.777 --> 14:40.044
- I can get it.
- [both laugh]

14:40.046 --> 14:43.181
- [chuckles] You got it.
- [Shauna] Thank you!

14:43.183 --> 14:43.815
[woman] Thanks, guys.

14:43.817 --> 14:45.550
- Thank you.
- I'm gonna walk.

14:45.552 --> 14:49.921
<i>[Shauna] Naiyh definitely was trying to
play with me when it came to the drinks.</i>

14:49.923 --> 14:51.923
I feel like she wants
to joke more sometimes,

14:51.925 --> 14:53.691
but then she starts to feel bad.

14:53.693 --> 14:56.127
<i>But I don't care if my friends
give me a hard time.</i>

14:56.129 --> 14:59.731
<i>And I am grateful that my
family joked off my disability</i>

14:59.733 --> 15:01.766
'cause it made me
have a tougher skin

15:01.768 --> 15:05.169
when it came to just normal
people, let alone my friends.

15:05.671 --> 15:07.839
- Put that there for him?
- Yep.

15:07.841 --> 15:09.941
<i>[Naiyh] When I first met
Shauna, she had a little bit,</i>

15:09.943 --> 15:12.911
<i>you know, some attitude,
some sass to her.</i>

15:12.913 --> 15:16.114
But I didn't want to, like, ask
her, you know, 'cause of her height,

15:16.116 --> 15:19.117
she looked like a kid, and it was
like, kind of awkward in the beginning

15:19.119 --> 15:21.686
to ask her, like,
how old are you?

15:21.688 --> 15:24.522
<i>[Edric] Yeah. Now, every time I
see Shauna, I don't really see her for,</i>

15:24.524 --> 15:25.924
<i>like, you know,
her height and everything.</i>

15:25.926 --> 15:28.459
I just see her as
who she is, so.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.263
Wow, that's good.

15:32.798 --> 15:34.165
That's dangerous.

15:34.167 --> 15:35.867
- Right?
- It's like sangria.

15:35.869 --> 15:37.135
Yeah.

15:39.638 --> 15:41.072
- Uh...
- To what?

15:41.074 --> 15:44.609
I honestly think Shauna has, has
a lot of, has a very high tolerance.

15:44.611 --> 15:48.313
I think my tolerance level
depends on who you ask.

15:48.315 --> 15:52.817
I think people will think that it
takes her like, a whiff of alcohol,

15:52.819 --> 15:54.552
like, just smelling it
to get her drunk.

15:54.554 --> 15:59.123
But she can take a lot, like, she's
come home tanked off of what?

15:59.125 --> 16:00.992
Five shots?

16:00.994 --> 16:03.194
- Three mimosas or something.
- I don't even know.

16:03.196 --> 16:06.230
And I thought it would
kill her. She was just tipsy.

16:06.999 --> 16:08.199
How's school?

16:09.668 --> 16:10.802
[Naiyh] So stressful.

16:10.804 --> 16:13.304
I changed my major
like, four times.

16:13.306 --> 16:14.572
You major in business, right?

16:14.574 --> 16:17.375
No. I major in linguistics
and communications.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.944
- I was previously in business.
- Yeah, I thought you were in business.

16:19.946 --> 16:24.215
<i>[Shauna] Maybe in the beginning
I started vaping to look older.</i>

16:24.217 --> 16:28.886
I don't know. I've always been
attracted to that edgy kind of lifestyle.

16:28.888 --> 16:31.122
With the tattoos, the piercing.

16:31.124 --> 16:35.727
<i>But getting tattoos, vaping,
doing anything adult-esqe,</i>

16:35.729 --> 16:38.730
wasn't to show anyone else
that I'm an adult.

16:38.732 --> 16:41.032
It was to prove to myself
that I'm an adult.

16:41.034 --> 16:44.469
That makes me feel like,
I am who I want to be.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.070
So, future.

16:46.072 --> 16:50.274
I mean, I know you were
chatting me in the group about that,

16:50.276 --> 16:52.410
but I don't think
you're ready for that.

16:52.412 --> 16:54.412
About what Shauna?

16:54.880 --> 16:55.546
Marriage.

16:55.948 --> 16:57.015
Marriage?

16:57.017 --> 16:58.916
I mean, is that the goal?

16:58.918 --> 17:01.552
- Yeah, definitely.
- Do you both want to get married, or?

17:01.554 --> 17:03.588
We were thinking about it.

17:03.590 --> 17:05.690
- Oh, God.
- Yeah.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.792
With my sister getting married
and my friends talking about

17:07.794 --> 17:11.629
their relationship, I'm starting
to think about my own dating life.

17:11.631 --> 17:14.766
I mean, my, my sister has done
online dating for me and stuff,

17:14.768 --> 17:19.670
but like, it's different
when you're in my situation.

17:19.672 --> 17:22.940
So, it's a more, I have
to see them in person.

17:22.942 --> 17:27.011
This, kind of stuff, like the, the looks
that y'all get when you walk with me

17:27.013 --> 17:28.713
that's the stuff that
they have to be analyzed on.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.381
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

17:31.116 --> 17:33.518
<i>[Shauna] Recently, Rylee and Tara
set up an online dating profile for me.</i>

17:33.520 --> 17:36.054
<i>But I realized online dating,
it's just not for me.</i>

17:36.056 --> 17:38.456
But I'm still looking for
new ways to meet new people.

17:42.694 --> 17:44.495
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:44.497 --> 17:46.764
<i>[Shauna] My friends could be
concerned about my happiness</i>

17:46.766 --> 17:49.534
because a lot of people
do relate it to relationships.

17:49.536 --> 17:51.803
I also think that they kind of
want me to have a relationship

17:51.805 --> 17:54.872
because they view it
as a form of independence.

17:54.874 --> 17:58.142
<i>They know that if the guy drives,
I'll be out of the house more.</i>

17:58.144 --> 18:00.978
<i>Like, that guy could provide so
many other opportunities for me</i>

18:00.980 --> 18:02.814
<i>and that, that could be
what they're thinking.</i>

18:02.816 --> 18:06.050
At the same time,
do I want a relationship

18:06.052 --> 18:08.920
because of that independence
or do I need it?

18:08.922 --> 18:11.956
No. I can do the
independence thing on my own.

18:11.958 --> 18:14.158
I don't need a guy
or whoever for that, like,

18:14.160 --> 18:16.360
that, it's fine.
You can stay where you are.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.163
- Okay. Well, should we cheers?
- Yeah.

18:19.165 --> 18:21.999
Cheers to, cheers to
independence.

18:22.001 --> 18:22.900
- To independence.
- Cheers to independence.

18:22.902 --> 18:24.101
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

18:24.369 --> 18:26.771
<i>[Naiyh] My hope for Shauna is
for her to be happy,</i>

18:26.773 --> 18:29.841
whether that means, you know,
that independence for herself

18:29.843 --> 18:32.977
or if she wants to settle down,
you know, just be happy in general

18:32.979 --> 18:37.014
and I really want her to be
strong, you know, she's got it.

18:37.016 --> 18:39.684
I believe in her, as long as
she believes in herself.

18:39.686 --> 18:41.686
I think the future is hers.

18:41.688 --> 18:44.856
<i>[Shauna] So to gain independence,
I want to start with driving.</i>

18:44.858 --> 18:49.727
I would like to have a driver's
license, a car, an apartment.

18:49.729 --> 18:53.731
<i>So I think in the next six months
it's going to be a lot of conversations</i>

18:53.733 --> 18:57.235
and hopefully more
action than talking.

18:58.670 --> 19:01.239
I have a doctor's
appointment with Dr. Cheek.

19:01.241 --> 19:04.842
<i>[Shauna] Since moving to Long
Island, I haven't really seen a doctor.</i>

19:04.844 --> 19:07.411
So this is my first initial
visit with this new doctor.

19:12.851 --> 19:15.353
But you do feel like someday
you would like to be a mom.

19:17.189 --> 19:18.256
[Dr. Cheek] Okay.

19:27.833 --> 19:28.866
- [woman] Hi.
- Hi.

19:28.868 --> 19:29.767
- [woman] How are you?
- Good. How are you?

19:29.769 --> 19:30.968
[woman]
Here we go. All right.

19:30.970 --> 19:33.738
[Shauna] I have a doctor's
appointment with Dr. Cheek.

19:33.740 --> 19:36.007
<i>When I was a baby, I was
diagnosed with brain cancer,</i>

19:36.009 --> 19:39.944
which caused my pituitary gland to
go dormant and stunted my growth.

19:39.946 --> 19:42.547
<i>I had a team of doctors
when I lived in Pittsburgh,</i>

19:42.549 --> 19:45.116
<i>but since I moved to New York,
I haven't really seen a doctor,</i>

19:45.118 --> 19:47.952
and that's why
I'm seeing Dr. Cheek today.

19:48.820 --> 19:50.154
- [woman] Shauna? Hi.
- [Shauna] Hi.

19:50.156 --> 19:51.689
[woman] Come on in.
How are you today?

19:51.691 --> 19:52.990
- [Shauna] Good. How good?
- Good.

19:52.992 --> 19:55.026
We're going to go right into
room four. My name is Kelly.

19:55.028 --> 19:56.928
I'm one of the
medical assistants,

19:56.930 --> 19:58.329
and I'm gonna get you
ready for Dr. Cheek, okay?

19:58.331 --> 19:59.997
[Shauna] Okay.

20:00.065 --> 20:03.234
<i>I've talked to Dr. Cheek on the phone
and gotten lab work done for this visit.</i>

20:03.236 --> 20:06.170
But this is the first time I'm
meeting Dr. Cheek in person.

20:06.172 --> 20:08.206
You can just step right up.

20:08.774 --> 20:10.007
Okay.

20:11.743 --> 20:12.877
All right, so we have

20:12.879 --> 20:16.280
your weight is 51 pounds.

20:16.282 --> 20:18.783
Okay, now I'm gonna have you
turn around for me, if you can.

20:18.785 --> 20:20.217
[Shauna] Mm-hmm.

20:22.888 --> 20:27.558
[Kelly] And your height is three
foot ten inches and three quarters.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.594
You can go ahead and have
a seat right on the bed for me,

20:29.596 --> 20:31.095
all right? Thank you.

20:31.097 --> 20:32.830
- Mm-hmm.
- [Kelly] And what brings you in today?

20:32.832 --> 20:35.166
Um, just doing
a routine checkup.

20:35.168 --> 20:37.602
[Kelly] All right, so she's gonna
be in in just a little bit, okay?

20:37.604 --> 20:38.636
[Shauna] Okay.

20:38.804 --> 20:40.538
<i>Checking on my health
is important to me</i>

20:40.540 --> 20:43.975
because my family does
have cancer on both sides.

20:43.977 --> 20:47.845
So it does make me worried about
cancer running through my system again.

20:47.847 --> 20:50.514
<i>And so I'd want to
catch anything</i>

20:50.516 --> 20:53.217
that happens in my body,
like the first chance I can.

20:53.819 --> 20:55.119
[both] Hi!

20:55.121 --> 20:56.887
- [Dr. Cheek] How are you?
- [Shauna] Good, how are you?

20:56.889 --> 20:58.089
[Dr. Cheek]
Good. Nice to meet you.

20:58.091 --> 20:59.957
- Nice to meet you, too.
- I'm Dr. Cheek.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.859
- I'm Shauna.
- Nice to meet you.

21:01.861 --> 21:03.060
I'm just going to get set up.

21:03.062 --> 21:05.162
- Okay.
- Get logged in.

21:05.164 --> 21:08.833
Why don't you fill me in
a little bit about yourself?

21:08.835 --> 21:10.735
Starting from the beginning?

21:10.737 --> 21:12.937
Let's jump in there from
the beginning, sounds good.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.839
Okay. Um, I was born normal.

21:14.841 --> 21:18.109
At six months, they noticed
that I had a tumor.

21:24.716 --> 21:26.083
After the surgery,

21:26.218 --> 21:29.687
they said that the tumor was
gone, but I could have a physical.

21:29.689 --> 21:31.455
- Or mental impairment.
- Mm-hmm.

21:35.694 --> 21:38.195
And that I was significantly
shorter than everyone else.

21:38.197 --> 21:43.534
And my endocrinologist said that
my pituitary gland was kind of dormant.

21:43.536 --> 21:46.671
<i>My condition is
a form of dwarfism.</i>

21:46.673 --> 21:48.973
<i>It's classified
as pituitary dwarfism,</i>

21:48.975 --> 21:53.010
which just means
proportional dwarfism

21:53.012 --> 21:54.512
but due to medical issues.

21:54.514 --> 21:55.980
From my understanding,

21:55.982 --> 21:59.784
most other forms
of dwarfism are genetic.

21:59.786 --> 22:02.953
<i>[Patty] After we found out that
Shauna's pituitary gland was dormant,</i>

22:02.955 --> 22:05.589
that's when the doctors
put her on growth hormones.

22:05.591 --> 22:09.393
<i>Shauna was on and off
growth hormones for years.</i>

22:09.395 --> 22:14.699
But it was really hard for her because
having shots physically hurt her so much.

22:14.701 --> 22:18.169
<i>And then probably at 15,
we saw another doctor.</i>

22:18.171 --> 22:20.671
<i>He got her on a different
kind of growth hormones,</i>

22:20.673 --> 22:22.473
<i>and she got
a couple more inches.</i>

22:22.475 --> 22:28.779
But she was already in puberty at
that point, which, it's shut off time.

22:28.781 --> 22:31.515
[Shauna] <i>The growth hormones,
they helped tremendously.</i>

22:31.517 --> 22:33.217
<i>I'd probably be two foot.</i>

22:33.219 --> 22:37.021
<i>But my doctor did tell us that if we
had stuck with the growth hormones</i>

22:37.023 --> 22:39.957
<i>when I was younger and
stayed on them for a constant,</i>

22:39.959 --> 22:43.127
I'd probably
be five foot right now.

22:44.396 --> 22:46.997
So do you have
any questions for me today?

22:46.999 --> 22:51.302
Specifically, I do have questions
when it comes to my fertility health.

23:06.718 --> 23:09.153
- Yeah.
- And I think that there are like a few factors

23:09.155 --> 23:12.957
to take into account specifically,
yes, with smaller body size.

23:12.959 --> 23:16.093
But but not a genetic form
of dwarfism.

23:16.095 --> 23:19.463
It logically means that the
baby that you would carry

23:19.465 --> 23:23.134
- would be an average sized child.
- Normal. Mm-hmm.

23:23.136 --> 23:27.872
So in my perspective, of course, that
would put you at a higher risk situation.

23:27.874 --> 23:32.109
And then, in addition, I know that
there is the history of chemotherapy

23:32.111 --> 23:34.745
and depending on
which chemotherapy you had,

23:34.747 --> 23:37.815
that may also
impact ovarian reserve

23:37.817 --> 23:40.184
and how many eggs and how
many good eggs you have left.

23:40.186 --> 23:44.822
In a sense, it would be my recommendation
that we get you set up with an OB-GYN

23:44.824 --> 23:46.690
so that you have somebody
that you can ask

23:46.692 --> 23:48.159
a few more questions
about this to.

23:48.161 --> 23:50.027
<i>[Shauna] Now that
I'm becoming an adult</i>

23:50.029 --> 23:51.796
and I have to think
about adult things,

23:51.798 --> 23:54.165
I'm starting to think
about my fertility.

23:54.167 --> 23:57.935
<i>The doctor did say it would be
risky for me to have a child at my size.</i>

23:57.937 --> 23:59.036
<i>I knew that answer.</i>

23:59.104 --> 24:01.772
<i>But I think my height
would affect the ability</i>

24:01.774 --> 24:04.074
<i>to take care of a child
tremendously.</i>

24:04.076 --> 24:08.078
Um, do I think I could
carry around a toddler?

24:08.080 --> 24:14.118
I can lift a five-year-old
for, like, five minutes.

24:14.186 --> 24:15.019
[laughs]

24:15.021 --> 24:16.787
<i>But, I mean, the major concern</i>

24:16.789 --> 24:18.856
<i>when it comes to having kids,
though with me</i>

24:18.858 --> 24:22.626
<i>after they are born, is the fact
that they will get taller than me.</i>

24:22.628 --> 24:26.797
That'll take a huge emotional
toll, not only on me, but on my child.

24:26.799 --> 24:29.867
And and that is the more
concerning things for me

24:29.869 --> 24:32.736
than the physical aspect
of me having a child.

24:32.738 --> 24:35.506
What other burning questions
are on your mind?

24:35.508 --> 24:37.541
Um, specifically,
I have migraines.

24:37.543 --> 24:42.079
I have, uh... I wake up
with them most of the time.

24:42.081 --> 24:44.215
I go to bed with them
most of the time.

24:44.217 --> 24:46.150
It's something I've kind of
grown used to.

24:46.152 --> 24:47.985
That doesn't sound great.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.854
That's happening
almost every single day?

24:49.856 --> 24:51.555
Yeah, I have one right now.

24:51.557 --> 24:53.224
- Really?
- Yeah, like right back here.

24:53.226 --> 24:54.758
Like, it's just
a slight throbbing.

24:54.760 --> 24:57.728
Um, and position wise, they do,

24:57.730 --> 25:02.700
like when I lay down, I get
nauseous and sensitive to light.

25:02.702 --> 25:07.037
So I'm definitely thinking in terms of
how often they're occurring for you,

25:07.039 --> 25:09.607
that I kind of want you to
see the neurologist, perhaps.

25:09.609 --> 25:11.175
Because that way they can...

25:11.177 --> 25:13.844
I don't know if they might
need to do another MRI

25:13.846 --> 25:16.180
at some point
just to follow them up.

25:16.182 --> 25:20.117
For the last few years, she's been
developing pretty significant headaches.

25:20.119 --> 25:21.151
She's getting nausea.

25:21.153 --> 25:22.853
She's getting sensitivity
to light and sound.

25:22.855 --> 25:25.990
So some of those are
classic migraine symptoms.

25:25.992 --> 25:30.094
<i>But you have to remember as well
that she has a history of brain cancer.</i>

25:30.096 --> 25:32.496
<i>So I did recommend that
she go see the neurologist</i>

25:32.498 --> 25:34.198
<i>to kinda go into more detail</i>

25:34.200 --> 25:38.002
before we come to the conclusion
that it is just classic migraine.

25:38.004 --> 25:39.003
Open up big and wide.

25:39.005 --> 25:40.471
<i>[Shauna] I think
the cancer coming back</i>

25:40.473 --> 25:42.673
<i>is definitely something
we both worry about.</i>

25:42.675 --> 25:46.677
Because we know how brain cancer
is not something to joke around with.

25:46.679 --> 25:50.014
It's...
especially the form I had.

25:50.016 --> 25:53.117
<i>[Patty] It's almost like it's not a
matter of if, it's a matter of when.</i>

25:53.119 --> 25:56.120
<i>So anything
that happens to Shauna,</i>

25:56.122 --> 25:59.623
we take it
extremely, um, serious.

25:59.625 --> 26:01.992
<i>After Shauna's surgery</i>

26:01.994 --> 26:05.796
<i>to remove the cancer,
there was still more left.</i>

26:05.798 --> 26:06.964
They couldn't get it all.

26:06.966 --> 26:10.100
So she had to do chemotherapy.

26:10.102 --> 26:14.204
And you hope that
it takes care of it all.

26:15.140 --> 26:16.540
You never know.

26:16.542 --> 26:21.378
<i>But they did let me know that
it would always be a concern.</i>

26:22.080 --> 26:23.247
That it may come back.

26:23.615 --> 26:24.715
So...

26:29.721 --> 26:35.359
I... I really worry that
it's going to be a reality.

26:36.027 --> 26:39.730
It's almost
more than a possibility.

26:39.732 --> 26:42.967
It just seems like
it's going to happen.

26:42.969 --> 26:45.536
It just seems like I'm always
waiting for that third ball.

26:45.538 --> 26:47.071
You know, the ball to drop.

26:47.073 --> 26:52.009
So, um, that's kind of
the stage I...

26:52.011 --> 26:54.511
That's my life.
That's what I live in.

26:56.114 --> 26:58.916
All right, Shauna.
So I'm glad we met today.

26:58.918 --> 27:01.118
We talked a little bit
about your migraine headaches,

27:01.120 --> 27:04.989
and I definitely think that it is an
important aspect of your ongoing care

27:04.991 --> 27:06.657
to keep seeing the neurologist

27:06.659 --> 27:08.892
and then fertility,
And where we go from there.

27:08.894 --> 27:12.496
I think the best option for you
would be to get you established

27:12.498 --> 27:16.166
with an OB-GYN who can kind
of dig into safely carrying a child,

27:16.168 --> 27:17.935
and would you be able to do it
to term and all of that.

27:17.937 --> 27:18.802
Okay.

27:18.804 --> 27:21.739
- Uh, any questions for me?
- None left.

27:21.741 --> 27:23.941
Okay, just hang out. Let me
lower you down a little bit more.

27:23.943 --> 27:26.710
- Okay.
- I left it too high there.

27:26.712 --> 27:27.911
[Dr. Cheek]
<i>I think Shauna is great.</i>

27:27.913 --> 27:31.782
I think for a 22-year-old
with a rare medical condition

27:31.784 --> 27:33.951
that can't really be
hidden from the world,

27:33.953 --> 27:36.954
she's done a pretty
remarkable job

27:36.956 --> 27:41.158
of coming to terms with herself
and accepting where she is,

27:41.160 --> 27:43.794
and I think she's gracefully
moving forward in life

27:43.796 --> 27:45.295
with the limitations
that she has.

27:45.297 --> 27:47.164
So, she's a wonderful girl.

27:47.166 --> 27:48.532
She's a wonderful woman.

27:48.534 --> 27:51.101
Maybe I should say
she's a wonderful woman.

27:51.302 --> 27:52.936
All right, come on with me.

27:52.938 --> 27:54.304
I'm gonna walk you out,

27:54.306 --> 27:56.674
and then we're gonna get you
set back up with a follow up, okay?

27:56.676 --> 27:59.309
- Okay.
- Right this way.

27:59.311 --> 28:02.146
How's your...
What is it, dating apps?

28:02.148 --> 28:03.981
Oh, I gave up on those.

28:03.983 --> 28:06.650
Shauna's dating life
has been a [bleep] show.

28:06.652 --> 28:08.218
It's just difficult
to date online

28:08.220 --> 28:10.054
when you can't see
the person face to face.

28:10.056 --> 28:12.022
They have to
understand the situation.

28:12.024 --> 28:15.959
My main concern with guys
who are interested in Shauna

28:15.961 --> 28:20.164
is you kind of think, "Why are
you looking at my daughter?"

28:20.166 --> 28:22.399
Have you ever tried matchmaking?

28:31.576 --> 28:32.743
[Shauna] I just gotta sit.

28:32.745 --> 28:35.446
[Patty] Yeah, apparently.
Here, we'll sit at this table.

28:35.448 --> 28:38.916
Today. I am having lunch
with my mother and Rylee.

28:38.918 --> 28:40.918
Welcome to the Harp & Hound.
Can I get us something to drink?

28:40.920 --> 28:42.686
What do you have?

28:42.688 --> 28:44.855
Well, I got sodas.
I got ginger ale.

28:44.922 --> 28:46.490
I can make you a Shirley Temple.

28:48.226 --> 28:50.861
It is typical
when we go out to eat

28:50.863 --> 28:53.097
for me to be
offered kid's drinks

28:53.099 --> 28:55.933
or fruit centerpieces
or whatever to be

28:55.935 --> 29:00.003
in my face or
in the way of some sort.

29:00.005 --> 29:02.973
It is normal for me
to get a kids menu,

29:02.975 --> 29:06.510
to get crayons
to be talked to like a child.

29:06.512 --> 29:08.212
Yeah, it's not fun.

29:08.214 --> 29:10.114
- Can I just have a water, please?
- Absolutely.

29:10.116 --> 29:11.782
[Patty] Can I get a water
with lemon, please?

29:11.784 --> 29:13.150
You didn't want
a Shirley Temple?

29:13.152 --> 29:16.220
- [Rylee] No.
- I had one when I was, like, seven.

29:16.222 --> 29:18.989
- Because of Shirley Temple...
- Like yesterday.

29:18.991 --> 29:20.891
[all chuckling]

29:20.893 --> 29:24.027
How's your...
What is it, dating apps?

29:24.362 --> 29:26.029
Oh, I gave up on those.

29:26.031 --> 29:28.999
They didn't work out for you?
No swiping?

29:29.001 --> 29:31.769
[chuckles]
I don't do online dating.

29:31.771 --> 29:32.803
Why don't you do online dating?

29:32.805 --> 29:35.472
That was more
of a her thing, idea.

29:35.474 --> 29:38.008
What do you have against it?

29:38.010 --> 29:42.513
It's just difficult to date online when
you can't see the person face to face.

29:42.515 --> 29:44.515
They have to
understand the situation.

29:44.517 --> 29:47.017
Well, maybe they see 3'10"
and they just don't know.

29:47.019 --> 29:49.153
Well, no one... Yeah...

29:49.155 --> 29:52.055
No one thinks that 3'10" is
short until you see it in person.

29:52.057 --> 29:54.992
<i>I think I've dated not a lot.</i>

29:54.994 --> 29:57.227
I don't... I don't think
it's that shocking.

29:57.229 --> 29:58.695
It's like seven people.

29:58.697 --> 30:01.465
I don't... I think
that's pretty normal.

30:01.467 --> 30:06.770
But I mean, I guess when you're
short of stature, people are shocked by it.

30:06.772 --> 30:09.506
I know y'all have concerns
when it comes to me dating.

30:09.508 --> 30:11.041
More concerns than I do.

30:11.043 --> 30:13.177
Well, we wanna make sure
that you're safe.

30:13.179 --> 30:15.946
- Yeah, I don't think about that.
- [Patty laughing]

30:15.948 --> 30:16.980
Maybe you should.

30:16.982 --> 30:18.515
You're putting yourself...

30:18.517 --> 30:23.754
You put yourself in situations
that aren't necessarily the best.

30:23.756 --> 30:26.957
I think Shauna's dating life
has been a [bleep] show.

30:26.959 --> 30:30.127
<i>If somebody crosses her path
and shows her some interest,</i>

30:30.129 --> 30:31.662
then she's like, "Oh, yeah."

30:31.664 --> 30:34.932
And she sticks with it
because it's better than nothing.

30:34.934 --> 30:38.302
You didn't
take my advice anyway.

30:38.304 --> 30:41.271
And you kept getting hurt
and kept getting hurt.

30:41.273 --> 30:43.774
Yeah, 'cause the advice
wasn't helpful

30:43.776 --> 30:45.142
except dump him.

30:45.144 --> 30:46.610
That would have been
very helpful.

30:46.612 --> 30:48.111
[Rylee] The advice
just wasn't what you wanted.

30:48.113 --> 30:50.948
What part of...
What part of "I love him"

30:50.950 --> 30:52.616
did you not understand?

30:52.618 --> 30:54.318
Yeah but even when I was
trying to walk you through

30:54.320 --> 30:57.020
on how to get through his lies
and how to get him to start

30:57.022 --> 31:00.457
like, maybe telling you
some truths, It never worked.

31:00.992 --> 31:02.993
<i>[Shauna] I date toxic people,</i>

31:02.995 --> 31:05.929
so my relationships always suck.

31:05.931 --> 31:08.665
My most recent relationship
was long distance.

31:08.667 --> 31:11.702
It went over the span
on and off for five years.

31:11.704 --> 31:16.974
It was kind of controlling
and isolation did happen.

31:16.976 --> 31:19.877
So there was
a lot of issues with him.

31:19.879 --> 31:23.380
And then there was a lot of issues with
my parents and him when they had met.

31:23.382 --> 31:27.918
I don't think my parents ever are
going to like any of the guys I bring home.

31:27.920 --> 31:29.086
- I understand...
- I'm just concerned.

31:29.088 --> 31:30.854
I understand.

31:30.856 --> 31:34.958
But you have to kind of
normalize my situation.

31:34.960 --> 31:38.829
I do feel like there are safety
precautions that you don't take.

31:38.831 --> 31:43.066
My main concern with guys
who are interested in Shauna is...

31:45.036 --> 31:46.069
I don't wanna say it.

31:46.071 --> 31:48.171
But you kind of think,

31:48.173 --> 31:49.940
"Why are you
looking at my daughter?"

31:49.974 --> 31:52.776
I mean, she looks seven.

31:52.778 --> 31:56.013
<i>I mean, I know she is more
mature as you speak to her,</i>

31:56.015 --> 32:00.250
but for you to look at my child
and go, "Hey, I want to date that."

32:00.252 --> 32:01.385
I'm like, "Hmm."

32:01.886 --> 32:03.854
[chuckles] It's questionable.

32:03.856 --> 32:07.157
And the bad part is, I probably
have said that out loud, you know?

32:07.159 --> 32:10.794
So Shauna takes that
with her too, a little bit.

32:10.796 --> 32:12.629
Do you think that you
just want a, like...

32:12.631 --> 32:16.199
Dating life or...

32:16.201 --> 32:19.269
No, I think I'm definitely
more a relationship person.

32:19.271 --> 32:23.173
<i>[Shauna] Personally, yes, I would say
I'm looking for a long term connection.</i>

32:23.175 --> 32:24.308
I want to learn with someone.

32:24.310 --> 32:25.742
I want to grow with them.

32:25.744 --> 32:28.912
I don't want someone who
doesn't want to grow or can't grow

32:28.914 --> 32:31.048
<i>because
their maturity is too low</i>

32:31.050 --> 32:33.016
<i>or something,
or whatever the case may be.</i>

32:33.018 --> 32:35.886
So I am looking for
more serious,

32:35.888 --> 32:38.889
more in-depth,
long lasting relationships.

32:38.891 --> 32:41.191
I just want to
take care of someone.

32:41.193 --> 32:45.295
I just want to give someone all
of the love that I want to receive.

32:45.297 --> 32:49.700
<i>And guys that come up to me
right away, they don't view it like that.</i>

32:49.702 --> 32:54.504
To me, that's just scary because
you have an ulterior motive

32:54.506 --> 32:57.841
and it's usually
like a really bad one,

32:57.843 --> 33:00.243
you just wanna see what it's
like with someone my height.

33:00.645 --> 33:02.145
They're tiny!

33:02.147 --> 33:05.248
- Are they good?
- Mm-hmm. You wanna try one?

33:06.050 --> 33:07.017
You wanna try one, Ry?

33:07.019 --> 33:08.652
- Mm-mmm.
- Come on, just try it.

33:08.654 --> 33:11.021
You have to be open
to trying new food.

33:11.023 --> 33:15.092
<i>[Rylee] I know my parents worry more
about Shauna's is dating than mine.</i>

33:15.094 --> 33:17.928
And it wasn't like that
she wasn't allowed to date,

33:17.930 --> 33:20.097
It's just that
we had to watch her more.

33:20.099 --> 33:23.500
And if people did ask her out,
we're like, "Is it a joke?"

33:23.502 --> 33:26.536
Like, what are you
trying to do, you know?

33:26.538 --> 33:30.941
Have you ever tried or wanted to
try something like matchmaking?

33:32.810 --> 33:35.145
Isn't that what
traditional families do?

33:35.147 --> 33:38.048
I don't know if traditional
families do it, but...

33:38.050 --> 33:39.750
Wouldn't that be
the same as online?

33:39.752 --> 33:42.886
When I say traditional
when it comes to matchmaking,

33:42.888 --> 33:47.224
I think the religious cultures
that use it naturally.

33:47.226 --> 33:52.262
I don t think of what
matchmaking is modern-wise.

33:52.264 --> 33:54.531
Do you have any control over it?

33:54.533 --> 33:56.233
With the guys?

33:56.235 --> 33:58.035
'Cause I don't want
a guy you pick.

33:58.269 --> 34:00.003
[laughs]

34:00.605 --> 34:02.039
I'm not going to match you.

34:02.041 --> 34:05.942
- Somebody else will match you.
- So you've looked into this?

34:05.944 --> 34:07.944
I'm just saying
we can look into it.

34:07.946 --> 34:09.579
<i>[Patty] I have
heard of matchmakers</i>

34:09.581 --> 34:12.115
<i>who've set up lasting
relationships in the past.</i>

34:12.117 --> 34:15.719
So I thought mentioning it to
Shauna I might be a good idea.

34:15.721 --> 34:17.921
They know what you want, right?

34:17.923 --> 34:19.523
They'll understand already.

34:19.525 --> 34:23.527
And you won't feel
a little strange.

34:23.529 --> 34:25.929
[Patty] <i>I personally am super
excited about a matchmaker.</i>

34:25.931 --> 34:27.998
It has a chance of working.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.967
I mean, I think it's better
than the alternative.

34:30.969 --> 34:33.036
I think it's a way
for her to meet people.

34:33.038 --> 34:36.206
It's a safer way to meet people.

34:36.208 --> 34:39.276
That person would
probably talk to you

34:39.977 --> 34:41.344
and find out what you like.

34:42.146 --> 34:44.081
What your preferences are,

34:44.083 --> 34:46.850
and then hopefully
has better success.

34:46.852 --> 34:48.185
[Rylee chuckles]

34:48.187 --> 34:49.853
Well, you would hope,
since it's their job.

34:49.855 --> 34:52.522
Yeah, Is that
something you're open to?

34:53.091 --> 34:55.192
I mean, I'm not against it.

34:56.360 --> 34:57.894
Rylee? I don't know
why I'm asking you.

34:57.896 --> 35:00.664
[Shauna and Patty laugh]

35:00.666 --> 35:02.933
<i>[Rylee] I think a matchmaker,
is actually probably</i>

35:02.935 --> 35:04.968
<i>one of the better ways
for Shauna</i>

35:04.970 --> 35:10.140
because she doesn't have to
be overly picky over somebody.

35:10.142 --> 35:11.741
Someone else gets to do it.

35:11.743 --> 35:14.077
She can't really overthink it.

35:14.079 --> 35:17.414
So, this is something
that you're okay with?

35:21.652 --> 35:23.286
I will do it for you.

35:24.122 --> 35:26.723
[Shauna]
<i>I am open to the matchmaking.</i>

35:26.725 --> 35:29.025
I'm not against the idea.

35:29.027 --> 35:31.795
I think it's a little
traditional, in my view,

35:31.797 --> 35:35.031
so I'm very open
to seeing what it's like.

35:35.033 --> 35:38.168
I don't know how this works.
We'll figure it out together.

35:40.037 --> 35:42.906
I'm gonna ask a bunch
of questions about you,

35:42.908 --> 35:45.709
<i>and I'm also gonna
ask about your past.</i>

35:45.711 --> 35:49.679
Today, I'm having a video
call with a matchmaker.

35:49.681 --> 35:52.015
Does it matter to you
his body type?

35:52.017 --> 35:53.850
Their weight could be a concern.

35:53.852 --> 35:56.686
Because if it does
get sexual eventually,

35:56.688 --> 35:58.889
- I'm only 50 pounds.
- Okay.

35:58.891 --> 36:01.892
I've been in a relationship, like
all the bases are covered and stuff.

36:01.894 --> 36:04.194
When I say
all bases have been covered,

36:04.196 --> 36:06.830
I've been intimate
with other people.

36:06.832 --> 36:09.032
Every little thing,
little square,

36:09.034 --> 36:11.268
whatever you wanna call it
is checked.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.546
[Skype call ringing]

36:24.015 --> 36:26.016
<i>Hello. First of all,
it's very nice to meet you.</i>

36:26.018 --> 36:28.084
Hi.
It's nice to meet you, too.

36:28.086 --> 36:32.789
My mom suggested that I see
a matchmaker for my dating life.

36:32.791 --> 36:35.592
So today I am actually
having a video call

36:35.594 --> 36:37.627
with a matchmaker.

36:37.629 --> 36:40.030
I'm gonna ask a bunch
of questions about you,

36:40.032 --> 36:42.499
and I'm also gonna ask
a bunch of questions

36:42.501 --> 36:44.634
<i>about maybe somebody
you're interested in meeting.</i>

36:44.636 --> 36:47.971
<i>But before we do that,
I'm just going to ask you</i>

36:47.973 --> 36:50.707
<i>a few general questions
about your past.</i>

36:50.709 --> 36:52.008
Okay.

36:52.010 --> 36:55.011
<i>What's been your you know,
your experiences so far?</i>

36:55.013 --> 36:57.914
Mostly, they're toxic.

36:57.916 --> 37:00.016
There's some kind of
control there.

37:00.018 --> 37:01.017
- The men that you've dated?
- Yes.

37:01.019 --> 37:02.419
- You've felt that way about them? Okay.
- Yes.

37:02.421 --> 37:05.121
Um, it's usually
the reason I end it.

37:05.123 --> 37:08.825
Due to the fact that my relationships
in the past have been very toxic,

37:08.827 --> 37:10.827
it is scary
to put myself out there,

37:10.829 --> 37:13.530
because every time, I'm
putting myself in a risky situation.

37:13.532 --> 37:15.532
But if I don't do that,

37:15.534 --> 37:19.936
I don't think I can ever find a
relationship, if I really want to.

37:19.938 --> 37:24.741
So I think that you have to put
some risk in to get happiness,

37:24.743 --> 37:27.711
and I don't know if that's
what my parents understand.

37:27.713 --> 37:30.714
There's not been much
public dating for me

37:30.716 --> 37:33.149
because usually
the guys don't...

37:33.151 --> 37:34.784
I don't know if
they don't feel comfortable

37:34.786 --> 37:36.219
or it's just not
something that happens.

37:36.221 --> 37:37.821
But I've never
like, been on a date.

37:37.823 --> 37:39.522
I've never been given flowers.

37:39.524 --> 37:42.158
It's not a date
unless it's planned,

37:42.160 --> 37:45.829
and you're actually going
somewhere to spend time together.

37:45.831 --> 37:48.098
If it's unplanned
and it's just hanging out

37:48.100 --> 37:50.867
and there's no, like,
intentions or anything

37:50.869 --> 37:53.737
and it feels like a friendship
kind of thing, it's not a date to me.

37:53.739 --> 37:56.006
Publicly dating.
I've never really done

37:56.008 --> 37:58.308
but I've been in a relationship

37:58.310 --> 38:00.143
like all the bases
are covered and stuff.

38:00.145 --> 38:01.745
- Um...
- Mm-hmm.

38:01.747 --> 38:04.414
When I say all bases
have been covered,

38:04.949 --> 38:07.550
I mean, physically, like,

38:07.552 --> 38:10.153
I've been intimate
with other people.

38:10.220 --> 38:11.454
Um...

38:12.189 --> 38:15.358
Yeah, every little thing,
little square,

38:15.360 --> 38:17.961
whatever you wanna call it,
is checked.

38:18.028 --> 38:19.929
Um... [chuckles]

38:19.931 --> 38:21.931
You know, the good thing
about relationships like that

38:21.933 --> 38:24.034
is they teach us a lot
about what we don't want.

38:24.036 --> 38:27.237
- Yes.
- And that's not gonna happen anymore.

38:27.239 --> 38:30.540
Ideally, I am just
looking for a nice guy

38:30.542 --> 38:31.941
with integrity.

38:31.943 --> 38:34.210
Someone who's
slightly adventurous

38:34.212 --> 38:35.979
but not fully adventurous.

38:35.981 --> 38:38.315
Because I don't want to have
to go somewhere every day,

38:38.317 --> 38:39.816
maybe, like once a week.

38:39.818 --> 38:42.952
I need a mixture of
an extrovert and an introvert

38:42.954 --> 38:45.055
but like also a nice person.

38:45.057 --> 38:47.057
You know, a respectful person,

38:47.059 --> 38:49.726
someone who's not gonna
talk down to me,

38:49.728 --> 38:51.828
someone who's
understanding of disability.

38:51.830 --> 38:54.731
There's a lot. Do I have
to keep going? [laughing]

38:54.733 --> 38:58.802
Does it matter to you
around his body type?

38:58.804 --> 39:01.838
So their body type really
doesn't matter to me, um,

39:01.840 --> 39:03.206
their weight could be a concern,

39:03.208 --> 39:07.744
because if it does get sexual,
eventually, I'm only 50 pounds.

39:07.746 --> 39:10.513
Okay. But I also want to hear
about your feelings

39:10.515 --> 39:14.017
about the height of the person
that you're on a date with.

39:14.019 --> 39:15.685
Height, it doesn't
really matter to me.

39:15.687 --> 39:19.089
I would like to have them
under six foot

39:19.091 --> 39:22.225
just because I don't want my
head to be at their groin area.

39:22.227 --> 39:23.493
[chuckles] Okay.

39:23.495 --> 39:24.961
Shauna likes tall guys.

39:24.963 --> 39:28.732
She will automatically be more
attracted to a tall guy than a short guy.

39:28.734 --> 39:31.134
And I don't even know why.
She just likes taller guys.

39:31.136 --> 39:33.002
Would a short guy be tall?

39:33.004 --> 39:35.205
That's what I was thinking.

39:35.207 --> 39:37.173
I try not to judge
on physical features

39:37.175 --> 39:39.809
because I don't want to be
judged on my physical features.

39:39.811 --> 39:41.778
So I do try to
get to know the person.

39:41.780 --> 39:43.880
I try to give everyone a chance.

39:43.882 --> 39:46.816
<i>I've never attracted
someone smaller than 5'2"</i>

39:46.818 --> 39:49.018
<i>and I've dated as tall as 6'4".</i>

39:49.020 --> 39:51.221
But height's
not an issue for me.

39:51.223 --> 39:53.690
Height's sometimes an issue
for the other person.

39:53.692 --> 39:56.126
Because I've dealt with
taller people my entire life,

39:56.128 --> 39:57.594
they haven't dealt
with a short person,

39:57.596 --> 40:01.998
so it's an adjustment period for
the other person versus myself.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.901
<i>Let's talk for a minute
round the world of race.</i>

40:04.903 --> 40:07.771
I've dated white guys and
've dated black guys.

40:07.773 --> 40:10.106
I'm more attracted
to darker complexion,

40:10.108 --> 40:13.109
like dark skin,
dark hair, brown eyes.

40:13.111 --> 40:16.980
I think I care more
about personality than looks.

40:16.982 --> 40:18.815
Personality is
so important to me

40:18.817 --> 40:21.284
because I don't want to be
judged off the way I look.

40:21.286 --> 40:23.052
Whether people think
I'm pretty or not.

40:23.054 --> 40:24.921
There's still that height.

40:24.923 --> 40:28.925
And so I do try to get
to know someone a lot

40:28.927 --> 40:30.827
before I even think
about dating them.

40:30.829 --> 40:33.930
I think we're leaning here
towards a blind date,

40:33.932 --> 40:37.700
which means that they're
not gonna see a picture of you,

40:37.702 --> 40:39.869
and you're not gonna
to see a picture of them.

40:39.871 --> 40:42.872
But I'm not going to
set you up with anyone

40:42.874 --> 40:45.542
that I don't personally call,

40:45.544 --> 40:48.211
that I don't personally
talk to on the phone

40:48.213 --> 40:50.413
and that I don't
personally like.

40:50.415 --> 40:53.183
Okay. That...
That's good.

40:53.185 --> 40:56.586
Yeah. And then I'm just going to
check your schedule and his schedule,

40:56.588 --> 40:59.055
and then I'm gonna
coordinate the whole thing.

40:59.057 --> 41:01.558
- Okay.
- All you really have to do is show up.

41:01.959 --> 41:03.960
Well, that's easy.

41:03.962 --> 41:05.061
<i>It is easy.
It's a lot of fun.</i>

41:05.529 --> 41:07.063
Okay.

41:07.065 --> 41:10.066
I don't know how long it will be
until she finds a suitable match.

41:10.068 --> 41:11.968
It's so iffy because

41:11.970 --> 41:14.671
I haven't met those
kind of guys she's describing.

41:14.673 --> 41:15.972
So, we'll see.

41:15.974 --> 41:19.142
I mean, I hope they're out
there, like she says they are.

41:21.545 --> 41:23.446
<i>Next time on I am Shauna Rae...</i>

41:23.448 --> 41:26.182
- [woman] Hello. How are you?
- Good, how are you?

41:26.184 --> 41:29.419
Tonight, we're looking for
bridesmaids dresses for Tara's wedding.

41:29.421 --> 41:31.354
- Are you excited?
- [Shauna] No.

41:31.822 --> 41:32.889
Rude.

41:32.891 --> 41:34.991
<i>[Mark] Tara and Shauna,
their relationship,</i>

41:34.993 --> 41:37.827
<i>especially after
Tara left high school,</i>

41:37.829 --> 41:39.762
became a lot more adversarial.

41:39.764 --> 41:42.665
<i>And I think that's
Shauna being jealous</i>

41:42.667 --> 41:46.236
that Tara is living the life
that she should be living also.

41:46.238 --> 41:48.171
Okay, this one fits not at all.

41:48.173 --> 41:50.106
The boobs are too big.

41:50.108 --> 41:51.774
Everything's too big.

41:51.776 --> 41:53.710
Not just the boobs.

41:53.712 --> 41:55.745
The adult style dresses,
it's a mess.

41:55.747 --> 41:57.280
Nothing fits me in general.

41:59.950 --> 42:04.020
So today I am going on a blind date
that was set up by Gaby, the matchmaker.

42:04.022 --> 42:05.622
What do you know
about this dude? I mean...

42:05.624 --> 42:07.223
I know his name is Abraham.

42:07.225 --> 42:10.760
<i>The only thing I know
about this guy is his name.</i>

42:10.762 --> 42:12.595
I have no other information.

42:12.597 --> 42:14.197
- Hi, I'm Shauna.
- Hi, Shauna.

42:14.199 --> 42:17.967
I wanted them to be blind dates
because there's a lot of judgment

42:17.969 --> 42:19.969
in people's faces when
they first see me.

42:19.971 --> 42:21.004
Well, give me a hug.

42:21.006 --> 42:22.205
Oh, a hug?

42:22.207 --> 42:25.141
<i>I'm trying to go into it
being very open minded,</i>

42:25.143 --> 42:27.310
but if it goes bad,
I have a weapon.
