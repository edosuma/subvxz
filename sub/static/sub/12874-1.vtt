03:54.817 --> 03:58.612
I hope our new Commander-in-Chief
isn't the coward they say he is.

03:58.947 --> 04:02.658
Whatever they say, Yamamoto is
the kind of leader we need.

04:03.117 --> 04:05.285
He believes in the value
of the airplane.

04:05.995 --> 04:09.623
But why a Vice-Navy Minister
for such an important position?

04:10.166 --> 04:13.502
Maybe the climate in Tokyo was
detrimental to Yamamoto's health.

04:13.962 --> 04:18.173
The Army is against him for
opposing their policies.

04:20.677 --> 04:25.973
So he runs away to sea. Now he
has the entire fleet to guard him.

06:48.783 --> 06:51.660
This order makes you
Commander-in-Chief.

06:52.078 --> 06:54.996
The Imperial fleet consists of...

06:55.748 --> 06:58.959
Save your breath, Yoshida.
Those details are in the documents.

06:59.460 --> 07:01.128
You haven't changed!

07:03.339 --> 07:05.507
With the Army controlling politics...

07:05.675 --> 07:08.969
...your job as Navy Minister
will be difficult.

07:09.637 --> 07:11.930
Thank God you're here.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.890
We know your life
has been threatened.

07:15.017 --> 07:17.519
I'm not that easy to kill.

07:19.814 --> 07:25.569
Army hotheads are demanding
an alliance with Germany.

07:26.779 --> 07:28.780
That would be tragic for Japan.

07:28.948 --> 07:31.741
As Navy Minister I will...

07:32.118 --> 07:34.703
...continue to fight with the Army.

07:36.706 --> 07:39.666
You are our last hope, Yoshida.

07:39.834 --> 07:42.836
The Navy must stand firm
against the alliance.

07:55.391 --> 07:58.852
America is against the war
we are waging in China...

07:59.312 --> 08:02.647
...and angry that we are
negotiating with the Germans.

08:03.524 --> 08:08.737
Now we are threatened with an embargo
of the raw materials we need.

08:08.905 --> 08:14.201
Either we improve relations with the U.S.
and withdraw from China...

08:16.871 --> 08:20.832
...or find another source of
raw materials here in Indo-China.

08:22.710 --> 08:26.004
Why worry about threats
from America?

08:26.756 --> 08:30.008
President Roosevelt's attention
is on Europe...

08:30.760 --> 08:35.347
...where Germany is winning a
quick victory over the Allied Armies.

08:39.936 --> 08:42.020
Now is the time to strike.

08:43.231 --> 08:49.069
The British, the Dutch and the French
are withdrawing their forces...

08:50.446 --> 08:57.118
...from Southeast Asia to
strengthen their armies in Europe.

08:58.579 --> 09:01.248
We must be careful.

09:02.583 --> 09:05.877
The Americans have an Army
in the Philippines...

09:10.091 --> 09:14.761
...and they have moved their Pacific
Fleet from San Diego to Pearl Harbor.

09:20.768 --> 09:24.646
Yes, and that fleet is a knife
leveled at Japan's throat.

10:06.272 --> 10:09.941
The Japanese ambassador just arrived.
He should be up shortly.

10:10.610 --> 10:11.651
Thank you.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.906
The Japanese are stalling, Henry.

10:17.408 --> 10:18.908
You know that.

10:20.536 --> 10:23.330
When Nomura took over as ambassador...

10:23.539 --> 10:26.666
...l had some hopes of settling
our differences.

10:26.876 --> 10:29.836
But our meetings so far
have been unproductive.

10:30.963 --> 10:34.507
He brings me proposals,
I offer compromises.

10:34.717 --> 10:38.303
He brings me counterproposals,
and so on.

10:39.639 --> 10:44.351
I tell you, Henry,
Nomura was sent here to buy time.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.936
That's what he's doing,
at our expense.

10:47.146 --> 10:49.064
The president believes him to be...

10:50.858 --> 10:53.151
...a man we can trust and deal with.

10:56.405 --> 10:59.199
Mr. Ambassador, we meet again.

10:59.408 --> 11:01.868
It is always a pleasure.

11:02.078 --> 11:05.830
I assume you know Mr. Stimson,
the head of our War Department.

11:06.082 --> 11:08.208
Oh, yes, of course.

11:08.417 --> 11:10.377
Mr. Ambassador.

11:10.586 --> 11:12.754
I do hope, Mr. Stimson...

11:13.005 --> 11:16.466
...your presence here
does not indicate anything ominous.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.093
Of course not, Mr. Nomura.

11:18.260 --> 11:21.262
Mr. Nomura, won't you please sit down?

11:21.472 --> 11:23.014
Thank you.

11:27.603 --> 11:31.231
Well, since our last talk
a week ago...

11:31.440 --> 11:33.733
...l have received certain...

11:34.402 --> 11:36.236
...shall we say...

11:36.487 --> 11:39.114
...questions from my government...

11:39.365 --> 11:43.618
...to put to you to
clarify certain matters.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.807
Good morning, colonel.

12:10.312 --> 12:11.813
There it is.

12:15.985 --> 12:19.612
This machine lets us intercept
every word between Tokyo...

12:19.822 --> 12:21.489
...and all Japanese embassies.

12:22.742 --> 12:26.035
The coded material is fed
into that machine.

12:27.830 --> 12:30.957
It goes round and round in there...

12:32.418 --> 12:35.587
...and comes out here,
decoded in Japanese.

12:35.838 --> 12:38.465
All we have to do is translate it.

12:41.844 --> 12:44.512
We decode this quicker than
the Japanese embassy...

12:44.680 --> 12:46.473
...right here in Washington.

12:49.185 --> 12:52.353
No wonder you decided to call it
"Operation Magic."

12:54.440 --> 12:57.275
- The latest intercept, sir.
- Thank you.

13:02.448 --> 13:05.325
Things are getting a little hotter
in the Pacific.

13:14.543 --> 13:17.462
As long as we're sharing
this assignment...

13:18.214 --> 13:20.173
...take a look at this.

13:25.346 --> 13:26.513
Behold the 12 apostles.

13:28.057 --> 13:31.559
The chosen few are authorized
to see the magic intercepts.

13:32.394 --> 13:35.897
Hap Arnold, Chief of the Air Corps,
isn't on the list.

13:36.398 --> 13:40.985
No, and not one of our
overseas commanders.

14:23.153 --> 14:24.445
Excellent!

14:31.453 --> 14:34.122
Who is in command of
those torpedo planes?

14:34.623 --> 14:37.792
Lt. Commander Fuchida, sir,
from the carrier Akagi.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.795
Send him this message from me.

14:41.255 --> 14:43.590
"Congratulations on brilliant
torpedo attack."

15:04.653 --> 15:08.281
lf we are forced into
a war with America...

15:09.116 --> 15:10.742
...Japan's only hope...

15:11.243 --> 15:14.829
...is to annihilate the American Pacific
fleet at the outset.

15:17.499 --> 15:20.919
I wonder if we could use
torpedo planes at Pearl Harbor?

15:32.514 --> 15:33.848
Stand by.

15:37.019 --> 15:38.102
Execute.

15:56.538 --> 15:58.957
Look at that entrance to the harbor.

15:59.166 --> 16:03.878
Sink one good-sized ship in the channel
and you've bottled up our whole fleet.

16:05.255 --> 16:09.801
You know as well as I do,
this harbor is a mousetrap.

16:11.178 --> 16:14.973
Fleet should have stayed
in San Diego where it belongs.

16:15.849 --> 16:18.643
I made the mistake to point
that out to Roosevelt.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.520
We're expected to obey orders.

16:22.690 --> 16:26.901
We're also expected to exercise
our own good judgment.

16:27.069 --> 16:28.403
I didn't ask for the job.

16:29.989 --> 16:34.075
Sorry, Kim, but this was my command,
and it's become habit...

16:34.326 --> 16:36.786
...to worry about the security
of the fleet.

16:38.497 --> 16:41.040
The British, flying some old biplanes...

16:41.250 --> 16:45.503
...torpedoed and sank three ltalian
battleships at Taranto.

16:45.713 --> 16:48.548
Harbor very much like this one.

16:49.591 --> 16:53.594
I share your concern, but CNO
doesn't think it can happen here.

16:53.846 --> 16:54.887
Why not?

16:55.055 --> 16:57.432
A torpedo dropped
from a plane plunges...

16:57.599 --> 17:01.269
...to a depth of 75 feet or more
before it levels off.

17:01.437 --> 17:04.564
I know, and Pearl is only 40 feet deep.

17:06.191 --> 17:08.026
I'm still worried, Kim.

17:17.869 --> 17:21.705
Frankly, sir, I was stunned
when I heard of your proposal.

17:22.374 --> 17:24.375
You think the plan is reckless?

17:25.210 --> 17:28.421
You suggest using torpedo planes
against the American Fleet...

17:28.881 --> 17:31.215
...but Pearl Harbor is
too shallow for that.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.551
Taranto is also a shallow harbor...

17:34.136 --> 17:38.639
...but the British torpedoed and sank
three ltalian battleships there.

17:39.975 --> 17:43.895
I know as well as you do
that my plan is a gamble.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.732
And it's risky,
but we have no choice.

17:49.151 --> 17:52.779
What I need immediately is
a plan for such an attack.

17:56.241 --> 17:58.242
Then we should consult with Genda...

17:59.912 --> 18:04.415
...the new Air Staff Officer on the Akagi,
a superb strategist.

18:04.833 --> 18:07.752
Yes, I remember Genda.
We'll talk to him.

18:42.871 --> 18:44.497
Glad to see you, Genda.

18:45.040 --> 18:47.166
So this is the new Zero?

18:47.918 --> 18:50.169
Type 21, with folding wings.

18:52.965 --> 18:56.134
This means we can carry
more fighters now.

18:56.552 --> 19:00.513
This Zero is fast, maneuverable
and has a long cruising range.

19:00.889 --> 19:03.141
Better than the Messerschmitt
or Spitfire?

19:03.475 --> 19:06.477
Definitely. I've seen both
in combat over London.

19:06.895 --> 19:09.480
You outrank me, so it must be true.

19:12.901 --> 19:16.696
Now that you're Staff Officer here,
things will be tough.

19:18.448 --> 19:21.242
You don't have to worry,
you won't be here.

19:21.660 --> 19:24.871
You're going to the Third Fleet
with a promotion.

19:26.373 --> 19:28.749
The Commander-in-Chief
must think you're good!

19:30.252 --> 19:32.920
Of course he does!
And I've got proof!

19:33.255 --> 19:36.382
Here is his telegram.
Want to read it?

20:03.952 --> 20:05.286
Ten-hut!

20:16.632 --> 20:18.633
Do the planes have to be
parked like that?

20:19.468 --> 20:20.927
Way at the edge of the field.

20:21.136 --> 20:23.137
Standard dispersal procedure, general.

20:23.388 --> 20:24.722
In case of enemy air attack.

20:26.433 --> 20:29.518
There are 130,000 Japanese
on this island.

20:29.728 --> 20:31.812
Our main problem is sabotage.

20:33.315 --> 20:36.234
It'd be too easy for enemies
to sneak in at night...

20:36.485 --> 20:40.154
...and blow up every one of them
if they're left out there.

20:40.781 --> 20:43.407
Make a note, Fielder,
we'll have to make changes.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.743
Ten-hut.

20:51.959 --> 20:53.876
- Yes?
- Admiral Halsey's here to see you.

20:54.044 --> 20:55.670
Send him in, please.

20:58.548 --> 21:03.552
Blast me, break me, court-martial me,
draw and quarter me...

21:03.762 --> 21:06.013
...if you think they're gonna
send my ships...

21:06.181 --> 21:08.432
...on convoy duty in the Atlantic.

21:09.434 --> 21:11.811
Kim, I think they've
gone nuts in Washington.

21:12.062 --> 21:14.563
How will I fight
a task force if they send...

21:14.773 --> 21:16.565
...my ships to the Atlantic?

21:16.775 --> 21:20.444
That damn ocean is a swimming hole
compared to the Pacific.

21:20.654 --> 21:24.115
What are we, a fighting fleet,
or are these toy boats out here...

21:24.324 --> 21:26.575
...so the Japs
can buy them at Christmas?

21:27.286 --> 21:31.330
All right, Bill, now ease it off.
It's not just you.

21:32.332 --> 21:34.709
They asked for some
of our tankers too.

21:35.210 --> 21:37.378
How do they expect to feed
these wagons...

21:37.587 --> 21:40.589
...parked out here on
this land-locked duck pond?

21:40.799 --> 21:43.718
You're still planning on rotating
half of them at sea?

21:43.885 --> 21:45.011
I was.

21:45.178 --> 21:49.640
Look, Kim, you've got to make them
understand what's going on out here.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.688
I'm gonna do everything I can, Bill.

21:56.481 --> 21:58.149
Even go to the president.

22:01.236 --> 22:04.238
By God, I knew there was
at least one man...

22:04.406 --> 22:07.366
...in this man's Navy
who hadn't gone nuts.

22:46.156 --> 22:48.199
"Gandhi" is still in hiding, sir.

22:49.701 --> 22:54.246
A strange man, he works in his
cabin like a hermit.

22:54.956 --> 22:56.957
But he should be here.

22:58.960 --> 23:02.588
Watanabe, go and ask him
to join us.

23:03.465 --> 23:08.135
When "Gandhi" concentrates on
a plan, he is lost to this world.

23:15.310 --> 23:19.480
Please don't bother me!
This is important...

23:19.981 --> 23:21.399
...so I'm not going.

23:23.902 --> 23:27.822
Genda's plan for attacking
Pearl Harbor...

23:29.282 --> 23:32.410
...is foolproof. It's brilliant!

23:33.954 --> 23:37.289
He stresses the importance
of combat aircraft.

23:40.710 --> 23:42.628
Just think of it.

23:46.967 --> 23:49.510
We use six aircraft carriers...

23:51.304 --> 23:52.930
...torpedo planes...

23:54.850 --> 23:56.767
...high-level bombers, dive bombers.

23:57.310 --> 23:59.311
Zero fighters for cover...

24:00.021 --> 24:05.317
...go by the northern route,
use the new torpedoes...

24:10.824 --> 24:14.118
...we attack on a weekend.

24:16.121 --> 24:18.664
Genda has thought of everything...

24:20.709 --> 24:22.126
...refueling...

24:26.256 --> 24:28.299
...the weather...

24:30.469 --> 24:33.888
And we go on to say,
"It should be noted that Japan..."

24:34.181 --> 24:38.476
...has never preceded hostile action
by a declaration of war.

24:38.685 --> 24:41.479
We have concluded it possible
that a fast-rated...

24:41.688 --> 24:45.733
...Japanese carrier force may arrive
in Hawaii with no prior warning...

24:45.901 --> 24:47.902
...from our intelligence service.

24:48.153 --> 24:51.405
The most favorable time
to the enemy would be dawn.

24:51.573 --> 24:54.825
He probably would employ
a maximum of six carriers...

24:55.076 --> 24:56.785
...strike on a weekend.

24:56.995 --> 24:59.538
- "We recommend that the Air Corps..."
- I read it.

25:00.707 --> 25:01.790
Yes, sir.

25:03.084 --> 25:07.546
I appreciate the work that you
and General Martin have put in.

25:08.757 --> 25:12.259
These reports are very useful
to General Short and myself.

25:13.678 --> 25:17.097
General Martin, you don't pull
any punches, do you?

25:20.393 --> 25:24.438
"We recommend that the Air Corps..."

25:24.606 --> 25:27.191
...maintain a thorough
360-degree search...

25:27.442 --> 25:30.069
...of the Hawaiian area during daylight.

25:31.029 --> 25:35.282
"This will require a force
of 180 B-17 airplanes."

25:35.450 --> 25:39.662
We can't search the sea approaches
unless we have the planes, sir.

25:40.413 --> 25:43.874
One hundred and eighty B-17s?

25:45.335 --> 25:49.380
For God's sakes, that's more than
the number existing in the States.

25:49.589 --> 25:53.801
It looks fine on paper,
but that's not a paper fleet out there.

25:55.637 --> 25:57.137
Squadron from the Enterprise.

25:57.389 --> 26:00.808
Bill Halsey's working
the tails off his men.

26:03.061 --> 26:05.104
Wish we had more like him.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.649
Makes the most of what he's got.

26:09.776 --> 26:11.569
Doesn't keep asking for the moon.

26:27.586 --> 26:32.506
Well, not one bomb anywhere
near the target for the past hour.

26:33.758 --> 26:37.303
Your pilots can see it, I suppose.

26:37.971 --> 26:41.181
- Who's next?
- It's Anderson, sir.

26:48.023 --> 26:50.190
Now, that's more like it.

26:50.442 --> 26:54.486
- Maybe your boys finally get it.
- I hope so, sir.

26:55.655 --> 26:57.114
Who's next?

26:57.949 --> 26:59.700
Lieutenant Dickenson.

27:06.041 --> 27:08.042
Tell Lieutenant Dickenson for me...

27:08.293 --> 27:11.295
...he couldn't hit a bull
in the butt with a bass fiddle.

27:11.504 --> 27:12.546
Yes, sir.

27:17.510 --> 27:19.345
Ten-hut.

27:29.230 --> 27:31.523
- Carry on.
- Carry on.

27:32.651 --> 27:33.692
This it?

27:33.860 --> 27:35.486
Yes, sir. Our new radar.

27:35.737 --> 27:38.155
It's a remarkable
scientific achievement...

27:38.365 --> 27:41.575
...capable of spotting an intruder
on the sea or in the air...

27:41.868 --> 27:42.993
...and at quite a range.

27:43.203 --> 27:47.414
Now, listen, colonel, as you know,
we're short on patrol planes.

27:47.582 --> 27:50.250
We're gonna have to rely on this...

27:50.502 --> 27:53.212
...thing to detect the enemy.

27:53.463 --> 27:56.173
General, radar should do the job.

27:56.383 --> 27:58.092
What's it doing here, not set up?

27:58.259 --> 28:00.594
We're about to truck it up
that mountain.

28:00.845 --> 28:05.683
That peak up there is the ideal spot
to put our main radar post.

28:05.892 --> 28:08.686
At that height, we'd be clear
of all interference.

28:09.437 --> 28:10.604
Obviously.

28:10.855 --> 28:14.566
But, sir, we can't get permission
to put her up there.

28:15.276 --> 28:16.318
Permission?

28:16.611 --> 28:19.113
From the National Park Service
Department of lnterior.

28:19.280 --> 28:23.742
See, all of this belongs
to the Hawaiian National Park.

28:23.952 --> 28:25.911
The Hawaiian National Park?

28:27.247 --> 28:30.999
Yes, sir. The Wildlife Preservation
Society is raising hell too.

28:32.752 --> 28:34.294
And we can't get permission?

28:34.546 --> 28:36.964
No, sir.
Not unless we want to fight them.

28:37.215 --> 28:40.050
Fight them? You're damn right
we're gonna fight them.

28:40.260 --> 28:42.594
- Now you make a note of that, Fielder.
- Yes, sir.

28:42.804 --> 28:46.306
Wildlife Preservation Society.

28:57.527 --> 28:59.319
I feel like a damn fool.

29:00.155 --> 29:02.406
Without even consulting me...

29:04.159 --> 29:06.618
...our Army has decided
to occupy lndo-China.

29:08.788 --> 29:10.956
There is no hope for peace now.

29:12.167 --> 29:15.169
I've said it before
and I'll keep on saying it...

29:15.628 --> 29:19.590
...if we fight the Americans, we can't
stop at Hawaii or San Francisco.

29:20.091 --> 29:22.301
We'll have to march
into Washington...

29:22.677 --> 29:25.763
...and dictate peace terms
in the White House!

29:27.474 --> 29:32.269
Army hotheads who speak so lightly
of war should think about that!

29:34.272 --> 29:39.443
As I'm no longer Minister of the Navy,
I can do nothing.

29:44.824 --> 29:46.200
I'm sorry.

29:46.868 --> 29:51.497
Don't blame yourself.
The Army leaders are at fault, not you.

29:55.710 --> 30:00.547
I must get back to the fleet.
There is a lot to be done.

30:06.304 --> 30:08.889
It's no use, Hal.
I spoke to General Miles.

30:09.098 --> 30:11.099
He took it up with General Marshall.

30:11.309 --> 30:15.229
The order stands.
The president is off the ultra list.

30:16.356 --> 30:18.148
Incredible.

30:18.399 --> 30:20.526
Withholding information
from the president.

30:20.735 --> 30:25.614
Security found a copy of an intercept
in a waste basket at the White House.

30:26.157 --> 30:30.369
Truth is, the brass don't trust
some men close to the president.

30:30.578 --> 30:33.080
Does anyone trust anyone anymore?

30:33.248 --> 30:36.500
- Do you even trust your own wife?
- Do you?

30:38.586 --> 30:41.255
Come to think of it, I believe I do.

30:42.882 --> 30:44.758
Part two of No. 1390, colonel.

30:45.009 --> 30:47.177
Tokyo to embassies
in Washington and Berlin.

30:47.387 --> 30:49.054
Thank you, Miss Cave.

30:53.768 --> 30:57.229
The Japanese are moving south
to occupy French lndo-China.

31:00.525 --> 31:02.943
- This is big trouble.
- Yeah.

31:03.862 --> 31:05.779
Well, ultra list or not...

31:05.947 --> 31:08.949
...someone has to tell
the president about this one.

31:13.746 --> 31:16.456
"Therefore, we will impose
a full embargo..."

31:16.708 --> 31:18.959
...on all trade with Japan.

31:21.087 --> 31:24.381
We do not anticipate immediate
hostile action by Japan...

31:24.549 --> 31:26.133
...but you get this information...

31:26.301 --> 31:30.888
"...so you may take appropriate
precautionary measures."

31:33.474 --> 31:36.310
"Appropriate precautionary measures."

31:36.603 --> 31:38.770
What the hell does that mean?

31:43.610 --> 31:48.572
Now, this is signed jointly
by General Marshall and Admiral Stark.

31:49.449 --> 31:53.577
Until we know how the Japanese will react,
we're not gonna take chances.

31:55.079 --> 31:57.831
- We go on full alert.
- Yes, sir.

31:58.833 --> 32:02.502
Stark says they don't anticipate
hostile action.

32:04.005 --> 32:06.006
Why send a warning at all?

32:07.592 --> 32:08.967
Damn it.

32:10.178 --> 32:14.765
Damn it, why can't Washington
give us the full inside story?

32:15.516 --> 32:17.601
I'd sooner form my own opinion.

32:20.772 --> 32:25.359
"Don't anticipate hostile action."

32:28.112 --> 32:31.198
Well, all right, we'll go ahead.

32:31.824 --> 32:34.868
Increase air and sub patrols,
alert senior commanders.

32:35.036 --> 32:38.789
Maybe out of this we can find out
how well we can function.

32:41.793 --> 32:42.834
Kaminsky.

32:43.002 --> 32:46.213
This is Captain Earle.
Going on full alert.

32:46.464 --> 32:47.881
Yes, captain.

32:48.383 --> 32:49.675
We're going on full alert.

32:49.884 --> 32:52.886
Notify all ship, sub and air patrols.

33:46.024 --> 33:48.108
What the hell is going on here?

33:48.359 --> 33:49.609
What are you doing?

33:49.861 --> 33:53.113
Carrying out orders.
General Short's concern is sabotage.

33:53.364 --> 33:55.949
All aircraft not ready
for flight from now on...

33:56.242 --> 33:58.326
...will be parked in the center...

33:58.536 --> 34:00.203
...so they can be kept under guard.

34:00.455 --> 34:01.913
Suppose there's an air raid.

34:02.123 --> 34:04.958
They hit one plane,
and it all goes up in flames.

34:05.126 --> 34:07.127
I'm sorry. General's orders.

34:51.755 --> 34:53.672
Today's war games...

34:54.382 --> 34:58.261
...of a theoretical attack
on Pearl Harbor...

34:59.806 --> 35:04.267
...clearly show the need for
six carriers in the attack force.

35:04.685 --> 35:06.937
The General Staff...

35:09.190 --> 35:12.526
...wants to limit us to only
three carriers.

35:13.820 --> 35:15.695
We must have six!

35:18.950 --> 35:21.159
If we reduce our striking force...

35:21.994 --> 35:23.870
...from six carriers to only three...

35:24.539 --> 35:26.623
...our mission will fail.

35:27.208 --> 35:31.211
Before attacking anything else,
we should attack our General Staff.

35:31.921 --> 35:36.508
We believe in aircraft,
but they cling to the ancient theory...

35:38.010 --> 35:42.222
...that decisive naval engagements
must be fought between battleships.

35:42.723 --> 35:44.474
Unless we dispel this myth...

35:44.934 --> 35:46.893
...we'll never get their approval.

35:48.312 --> 35:52.190
They are not the only believers
in the "battleship theory."

35:52.984 --> 35:57.195
Many officers here today
also support the idea.

35:58.698 --> 36:03.326
I'm one of them. We'll soon have
two new unsinkable battlewagons...

36:04.537 --> 36:08.248
...each with a displacement of
64,000 tons and huge guns.

36:09.083 --> 36:12.878
Anything that floats can be sunk!
The "unsinkable" ship is a myth.

36:13.671 --> 36:16.339
The war in Europe is being
decided by the airplane.

36:16.883 --> 36:21.011
There can be no victory on land or sea,
without control of the air!

36:21.596 --> 36:24.598
I have been chosen to command
this task force.

36:25.558 --> 36:27.893
And I consider this operation risky.

36:28.060 --> 36:32.397
How can we travel 3500 miles
to Hawaii without being detected?

36:32.940 --> 36:36.568
This mission will fail unless
we achieve complete surprise.

36:36.944 --> 36:39.613
My ships can't carry fuel
for a trip there and back.

36:39.989 --> 36:43.867
Stopping to refuel increases
the possibility of detection.

36:47.079 --> 36:51.541
I am confident that our ships
will reach Hawaii safely.

36:52.418 --> 36:56.880
You are too cautious. The case
for using six carriers is sound.

36:57.465 --> 37:00.425
To criticize the plan is defeatist!

37:17.818 --> 37:23.949
No more bickering! As long
as I am Commander-in-Chief...

37:25.326 --> 37:27.953
...Pearl Harbor will be attacked!

37:31.832 --> 37:34.751
I am aware that this is
a dangerous gamble.

37:35.628 --> 37:38.505
But we can't afford the luxury
of playing it safe now!

37:45.179 --> 37:49.516
Gentlemen, whether we adopt this
plan or not is no longer an issue.

37:50.184 --> 37:53.770
Let us now decide how best
to carry it out.

38:09.996 --> 38:12.080
Fuchida's back! Fuchida's back!

38:18.629 --> 38:20.880
Fuchida! What a surprise!

38:21.382 --> 38:24.551
I'm your new Air Commander,
so treat me well.

38:25.052 --> 38:29.139
You're joking. How did you
rate another promotion?

38:29.890 --> 38:33.059
Well, exceptional people get
exceptional treatment!

38:44.322 --> 38:46.906
This ship is crawling with Admirals.

38:47.742 --> 38:50.410
Something important
must be happening.

38:52.204 --> 38:54.205
We have called you here...

38:54.707 --> 38:58.084
...to explain the purpose of
a new training program.

38:59.086 --> 39:02.756
This, of course, is a matter
of strictest secrecy.

39:48.803 --> 39:51.262
It looks just like Pearl Harbor,
doesn't it?

39:52.139 --> 39:55.058
And that area down there
looks like Ford lsland, eh?

40:32.304 --> 40:33.763
Beautiful!

40:57.538 --> 41:00.832
Navy pilots attract geisha girls
but they frighten the fish.

41:14.472 --> 41:18.308
It's not an ideal radar sight,
but at least we got a permit.

41:18.517 --> 41:20.393
Let's get the other units working.

41:20.644 --> 41:21.895
Easier said than done.

41:22.062 --> 41:23.146
What do you mean?

41:23.355 --> 41:27.775
We have to get all six units adjusted
and link them by phone to headquarters.

41:28.027 --> 41:31.029
That means training men to operate
an information center...

41:31.238 --> 41:33.573
...so they know what to do
with the information.

41:33.824 --> 41:35.158
Take it easy, Murph.

41:35.367 --> 41:40.330
- You'll figure it out.
- Yeah, I'll figure it out.

41:43.584 --> 41:44.918
Don't just stand there.

41:45.169 --> 41:47.045
You know how to operate this thing.

41:47.213 --> 41:48.254
We know the theory.

41:48.422 --> 41:50.423
Let's put that theory into practice.

41:50.674 --> 41:53.343
- Switch on.
- Yes, sir.

41:56.055 --> 41:58.431
Stay put and keep watching the screen.

41:58.682 --> 42:02.393
In two hours, close down.
I'll send a truck to pick you up.

42:02.603 --> 42:05.438
Excuse me, sir,
but what are we watching for?

42:05.689 --> 42:06.814
Anything unusual.

42:07.024 --> 42:09.234
Any large blip coming from the sea.

42:09.443 --> 42:12.237
Colonel, if we do spot something,
what do we do?

42:12.446 --> 42:15.031
Report it to headquarters, damn it.

42:15.241 --> 42:16.574
- How, sir?
- What?

42:16.825 --> 42:18.618
We haven't got a telephone, sir.

42:18.911 --> 42:22.080
There's a gas station
a mile down the road.

42:22.289 --> 42:23.748
They must have a phone.

42:34.802 --> 42:38.930
We got 183 combat planes
on this base, general.

42:39.139 --> 42:43.142
The way they're parked now, a one-eyed
monkey hanging from a balloon...

42:43.394 --> 42:46.062
...could scatter them to hell
with one hand grenade.

42:46.272 --> 42:49.232
Don't blame me.
General Short gave the order.

42:49.441 --> 42:50.733
Come in.

42:51.777 --> 42:55.863
- Sir, Lieutenants Taylor and Welch.
- Okay, send them in.

43:02.663 --> 43:05.498
You two men get in your planes
and fly over to Haleiwa.

43:06.875 --> 43:08.501
Yes, sir.

43:08.669 --> 43:10.670
What are our orders when we get there?

43:11.463 --> 43:12.755
Just sit tight.

43:12.965 --> 43:15.383
Listen for the phone. That's all.

43:15.593 --> 43:16.884
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

43:25.394 --> 43:28.021
Haleiwa is one
of the subsidiary fields.

43:28.272 --> 43:31.899
We send those two up there,
two more here.

43:33.027 --> 43:36.029
Only way I know to disperse
a few of the planes.

43:39.199 --> 43:42.785
If I'd get away with it,
I'd send all to the neighbor islands.

43:43.662 --> 43:47.040
- You know why we're being transferred.
- Them poker games.

43:47.291 --> 43:48.958
Been winning too often.

43:49.126 --> 43:50.460
Yeah.

43:50.628 --> 43:54.339
Some sucker loses his shirt,
so he bitches to the general.

43:59.845 --> 44:01.971
It's hard to believe
the Emperor agreed...

44:02.139 --> 44:05.058
...to fix a date by which the
final decision must be made...

44:05.559 --> 44:07.352
...between war and peace.

44:07.895 --> 44:12.065
His majesty's signature
is a mere formality.

44:12.566 --> 44:17.362
The cabinet is responsible for
all matters of national policy.

44:18.364 --> 44:23.451
The Emperor recently read a poem
to his Ministers to show how he feels.

44:24.078 --> 44:26.871
"If all people are brethren..."

44:28.749 --> 44:32.251
"...then why are the winds
and the waves so restless?"

44:36.048 --> 44:38.716
"lf all people are brethren...

44:39.259 --> 44:42.595
...then why are the winds
and the waves so restless?"

44:46.016 --> 44:50.019
This clearly shows how much
the Emperor wants to avoid a war.

44:52.272 --> 44:56.442
Yes, he has urged us to solve our
differences with Washington.

44:58.570 --> 45:02.907
But, sir, the deadline is October.
Can a solution be found by then?

45:04.743 --> 45:06.577
Perhaps. But if we fail...

45:07.121 --> 45:10.748
...if war does come...

45:12.084 --> 45:15.128
...tell me frankly,
from the Navy's viewpoint...

45:15.796 --> 45:18.464
...what are our chances
against the Americans?

45:19.425 --> 45:23.386
If we must, we can raise havoc
with them for a year.

45:24.596 --> 45:27.140
After that, I can guarantee nothing.

45:32.479 --> 45:35.773
Mr. Prime Minister, I hope you
will continue the negotiations.

45:36.275 --> 45:39.318
Please remember, there is
no last word in diplomacy.

45:54.501 --> 45:57.462
Tokyo has ignored
my repeated inquiries...

45:59.506 --> 46:02.049
...and still has made no reply...

46:04.052 --> 46:07.346
...to the compromise proposals
offered by Secretary Hull.

46:17.483 --> 46:20.193
The war that I have dreaded
for so long...

46:22.362 --> 46:24.572
...may soon become a reality.

46:27.367 --> 46:30.703
Nomura has offered
his resignation several times.

46:30.954 --> 46:33.206
But Tokyo won't let him quit.

46:34.666 --> 46:39.629
Instead they're sending a second
ambassador, Kurusu, to help him out.

46:41.799 --> 46:45.301
Do you really think
this Kurusu can do any good?

46:45.677 --> 46:48.221
Well, I doubt it, Frank.

46:48.472 --> 46:50.807
He's hardly the most tactful choice.

46:51.058 --> 46:53.184
When he was ambassador in Berlin...

46:53.393 --> 46:56.229
...he signed the Axis Pact
on behalf of Japan.

46:57.773 --> 47:02.151
You will sail from Hittakopu Bay
on November 26 under my strict orders.

47:02.319 --> 47:05.738
The code, "Climb Mt. Niitaka"
will be confirmation to go on.

47:06.698 --> 47:10.201
We have tentatively set
the date for the attack...

47:11.995 --> 47:14.580
...on Sunday, December 7th,
Hawaiian time.

47:18.252 --> 47:22.880
But you must understand that we
are still negotiating in Washington.

47:23.590 --> 47:27.051
If a peaceful solution is found...

47:27.678 --> 47:30.930
...the fleet will be recalled at once.

47:36.895 --> 47:39.772
Once at sea, to turn back
would be a disgrace!

47:40.899 --> 47:42.900
It would destroy the morale of the men!

47:43.277 --> 47:47.071
They're in a high state of readiness,
physically and psychologically.

47:50.284 --> 47:54.287
Enough! If any commander is inclined
to reject an order to return...

47:54.955 --> 47:56.956
...when the path for peace is open...

47:57.541 --> 47:59.959
...let him resign now!

48:11.889 --> 48:13.681
Finally, gentlemen...

48:16.518 --> 48:18.436
...many misinformed Japanese...

48:18.979 --> 48:22.982
...believe that America is a
nation divided, isolationist...

48:24.818 --> 48:26.986
...and that Americans are
only interested...

48:27.988 --> 48:30.948
...in enjoying a life of luxury...

48:32.993 --> 48:35.494
...and are spiritually
and morally corrupt.

48:36.955 --> 48:38.748
But that is a great mistake.

48:41.126 --> 48:42.835
If war becomes inevitable...

48:44.087 --> 48:50.635
...America would be the most formidable
foe that we have ever fought.

48:56.642 --> 48:59.644
I've lived in Washington
and studied at Harvard...

49:00.145 --> 49:04.315
...so I know the Americans are
a proud and just people.

49:12.532 --> 49:15.368
- You sick or something?
- No.

49:16.370 --> 49:19.789
I've been piecing together
this batch of new intercepts.

49:19.998 --> 49:22.875
A frightening picture is taking shape.

49:24.002 --> 49:27.463
Ambassadors Nomura and Kurusu
asked their government...

49:27.673 --> 49:32.635
...to extend a deadline for suspending
negotiation between Japan and America.

49:32.886 --> 49:34.679
- You remember that?
- Yeah.

49:34.888 --> 49:38.891
Now, according to this latest
intercept...

49:39.184 --> 49:42.645
...Tokyo wants to conclude
negotiations with us...

49:42.854 --> 49:45.815
...no later than November 29...

49:46.024 --> 49:48.567
...after which, and I quote:

49:48.777 --> 49:51.529
"Things are automatically
going to happen."

49:51.863 --> 49:56.200
Now, look at this intelligence report
from the British.

49:57.285 --> 50:00.329
Five Japanese troop transports
with naval escort...

50:00.539 --> 50:03.916
...were sighted off Formosa,
heading south.

50:04.251 --> 50:08.379
We've been monitoring their fleet.
Most of it seems to be on home waters.

50:08.588 --> 50:10.715
I'm not so sure.

50:17.889 --> 50:20.349
I'd make a bet they're going to attack us.

50:23.812 --> 50:26.564
Japan is going to attack us.

50:28.275 --> 50:31.068
The 29th is only four days off.

50:32.446 --> 50:34.780
The 30th is on a Sunday.

50:37.034 --> 50:40.536
We're gonna be attacked on Sunday,
the 30th of November.

50:46.043 --> 50:48.252
The pieces fit together.

50:52.132 --> 50:53.466
But can you prove it?

50:53.717 --> 50:57.636
No. But I'm convinced I'm right.

50:58.847 --> 51:00.765
Miss Cave? Get me General Marshall.

51:00.974 --> 51:03.934
General Marshall's at Fort Benning, sir.

51:04.436 --> 51:06.645
Then get me the secretary of war.

51:10.275 --> 51:12.151
I've got the evidence, Al.

51:14.237 --> 51:17.740
And I'm gonna make the brass
around here admit I'm right.

51:27.334 --> 51:30.586
Bratton's analysis makes sense.

51:31.254 --> 51:34.423
His facts are undeniable.

51:36.259 --> 51:41.514
Henry, I'm washing my hands
of the whole matter.

51:42.015 --> 51:44.266
From now on, it's in your hands...

51:44.476 --> 51:47.186
...and in those
of the Navy Department.

52:07.040 --> 52:08.207
I'll call the president.

52:09.543 --> 52:13.337
A message declaring a full alert
will be sent out.

52:13.505 --> 52:18.676
Sir, General Marshall anticipated
an emergency like this.

52:18.885 --> 52:21.095
Before he left to attend maneuvers...

52:21.346 --> 52:23.347
...he made out this alert order.

52:51.042 --> 52:55.212
As you know, after the Cabinet
decided to send Japan to war...

52:55.380 --> 52:58.591
...they held an lmperial Conference
at the palace.

53:00.760 --> 53:05.264
His Majesty, who participated
in this conference...

53:05.432 --> 53:07.683
...which is a mere formality...

53:07.851 --> 53:11.604
...was depressed and silent
all through the meeting.

53:12.898 --> 53:18.193
Today His Majesty will ask
the customary questions about the war...

53:18.361 --> 53:21.363
...and you will make
the traditional replies.

53:22.324 --> 53:26.493
There can be no more tragic ritual
than this conversation...

53:26.661 --> 53:30.289
...between His Majesty
who does not want war...

53:30.457 --> 53:34.168
...and Your Excellency,
who has opposed it so vigorously.

53:36.504 --> 53:39.506
As Minister of the lmperial Household...

53:39.674 --> 53:42.801
...l am not allowed to attend this ritual.

53:42.969 --> 53:44.803
Fortunately for me...

53:45.680 --> 53:50.142
...l won't have to witness
this tragic ceremony.

53:57.484 --> 53:59.985
I can go no farther.

54:00.153 --> 54:03.781
The Military Attaché will
take you from here.

55:24.279 --> 55:25.904
Sir, a message!

55:30.910 --> 55:35.289
"From Admiral Yamamoto,
Commander-in-Chief, Combined Fleet..."

55:36.082 --> 55:38.834
...to Admiral Nagumo, Third Fleet...

55:40.086 --> 55:41.962
"...climb Mount Niitaka."

55:45.258 --> 55:49.303
Hostilities will begin
on December 7th...

55:52.766 --> 55:54.349
...exactly as scheduled.

56:02.553 --> 56:04.387
Read this back to me.

56:09.268 --> 56:12.061
"Japanese future action unpredictable."

56:12.313 --> 56:15.732
But hostile action possible
at any moment.

56:16.233 --> 56:18.359
If hostilities cannot be avoided...

56:18.569 --> 56:23.573
"...the United States desires that
Japan commit the first overt act."

56:23.782 --> 56:25.366
Read that again.

56:27.911 --> 56:32.915
"If hostilities cannot be avoided,
the United States desires..."

56:33.083 --> 56:36.919
...that Japan commit the first overt act.

56:38.589 --> 56:41.716
This shouldn't be construed
as restricting you...

56:41.925 --> 56:45.720
...to a course of action
jeopardizing your defense.

56:45.929 --> 56:48.890
Prior to hostile Japanese action...

56:49.099 --> 56:52.018
...you are directed to undertake
reconnaissance...

56:52.227 --> 56:55.313
...and other measures
as you deem necessary.

56:55.522 --> 57:00.234
These measures should be carried out
so as not to alarm the civil population...

57:00.444 --> 57:02.278
...or disclose intent.

57:02.446 --> 57:04.906
"By order of General George C. Marshall."

57:05.366 --> 57:08.409
"Not to alarm the civil population."

57:09.828 --> 57:11.120
What do you make of it?

57:12.873 --> 57:18.461
Well, if you ask me, sir, it's double talk.

57:20.339 --> 57:23.591
But the chief of staff doesn't go in
for double talk.

57:25.386 --> 57:27.095
- We're going on alert.
- Again?

57:27.346 --> 57:30.139
But the men are confused.
So many alerts.

57:30.391 --> 57:33.309
- Damn it, unconfuse them.
- Yes, sir.

57:35.479 --> 57:38.064
"Japanese forces may attack
the Philippines..."

57:38.273 --> 57:41.609
...Thailand, the Kra Peninsula
and Borneo.

57:42.486 --> 57:46.114
"This dispatch is to be considered
a war warning."

57:49.785 --> 57:51.661
Well, there it is, gentlemen.

57:53.163 --> 57:56.290
You now have
as much information as I do.

57:56.792 --> 57:58.960
That's the second warning
in three days.

57:59.169 --> 58:01.921
"Japanese forces may attack
the Philippines...

58:02.131 --> 58:04.173
...Thailand, the Kra Peninsula
and Borneo."

58:04.425 --> 58:05.508
They don't mention us.

58:05.759 --> 58:09.637
That's correct. I think it should be
considered significant.

58:10.931 --> 58:12.265
Well, gentlemen...

58:13.517 --> 58:15.935
...we have a job to do.

58:16.145 --> 58:19.772
Washington wants us to send
a squadron of fighters to Midway.

58:20.315 --> 58:23.401
And another squadron to Wake.

58:23.694 --> 58:25.319
When can you sail?

58:26.280 --> 58:30.158
Well, the Enterprise can sail
tomorrow morning.

58:31.618 --> 58:36.456
I'll need a day or two. We're just
completing repairs on the Lexington.

58:36.665 --> 58:38.416
Hurry things along, John.

58:38.625 --> 58:40.501
I want you out there to probe.

58:40.711 --> 58:43.546
I want planes up in the air
morning and afternoon.

58:43.714 --> 58:47.300
I want a report on any sign
of hostile ships.

58:47.509 --> 58:48.551
Understood.

58:49.011 --> 58:50.553
Do you want battleships along?

58:50.721 --> 58:52.513
Hell, no. They're too slow.

58:52.723 --> 58:54.682
If we're gonna probe, let's probe.

58:54.933 --> 58:57.059
We don't want anything holding us up.

58:57.227 --> 59:00.813
You're right, but I'm not ready
to commit them myself.

59:01.023 --> 59:02.857
Not until I know when and where.

59:03.066 --> 59:06.402
Do you plan to keep half the fleet
at sea while the carriers are gone?

59:06.570 --> 59:08.571
No, it's too risky.

59:08.739 --> 59:12.325
I'll have to keep the fleet
here at Pearl while you're away.

59:12.534 --> 59:15.369
Get out. Get back as soon as you can.

59:15.579 --> 59:19.707
I don't like the idea of having my
battleships without air cover.

59:20.250 --> 59:23.669
- Let's get going.
- Yes, sir.

59:25.088 --> 59:26.506
Admiral.

59:32.721 --> 59:34.055
Kim.

59:35.224 --> 59:36.933
Level with me.

59:38.185 --> 59:40.061
I want a clear directive.

59:41.271 --> 59:44.357
If I run into a Jap ship,
what action do I take?

59:47.110 --> 59:48.986
Use your common sense.

59:52.407 --> 59:55.076
That's the best damn order I ever had.

59:58.413 --> 01:00:02.708
If I see so much as a sampan there...

01:00:02.918 --> 01:00:04.502
...I'll blow it out of the water.

01:00:19.601 --> 01:00:22.311
"Intelligence Report,
U.S. ships now at Pearl Harbor..."

01:00:22.937 --> 01:00:25.773
...six battleships, three light cruisers...

01:00:26.274 --> 01:00:28.317
"...16 destroyers and one
aircraft carrier."

01:00:30.779 --> 01:00:33.781
No information about
the other American carriers.

01:00:43.291 --> 01:00:44.541
You know today's date?

01:00:44.709 --> 01:00:46.460
December 1st.

01:00:46.628 --> 01:00:50.714
Yes, but tonight will be November 30th.

01:00:52.342 --> 01:00:55.969
When we cross
the lnternational Date Line...

01:00:56.137 --> 01:00:58.681
...we'll push the clock ahead five hours...

01:00:58.848 --> 01:01:03.602
...and turn the calendar back a full day,
making today yesterday.

01:01:03.770 --> 01:01:07.731
Don't be silly!
Today can't change into yesterday!

01:01:12.195 --> 01:01:16.740
You're not too intelligent
but I'll try to explain...

01:01:16.908 --> 01:01:22.746
...so listen carefully.
It's a little before 1300 hours, right?

01:01:22.914 --> 01:01:25.499
So why are we making supper
at this hour?

01:01:29.337 --> 01:01:31.797
1300? It should be lunchtime.

01:01:31.965 --> 01:01:37.511
Right! And the Date Line makes up
for that time difference...

01:01:37.679 --> 01:01:41.098
...by turning today into yesterday.

01:01:42.851 --> 01:01:47.396
I don't quite understand, but if we
see the enemy across that line...

01:01:47.564 --> 01:01:50.774
...l guess it would be useless
to shoot at them.

01:01:51.693 --> 01:01:56.196
Because how can today's shells
hit yesterday's enemy?

01:02:17.177 --> 01:02:19.428
What is it this time,
getting me over here?

01:02:19.637 --> 01:02:22.473
Tokyo has alerted their embassy
to stand by...

01:02:22.682 --> 01:02:26.143
...for a very long message in 14 parts.

01:02:26.811 --> 01:02:30.147
Look, Rufe, you scared me
and everybody else last week.

01:02:30.356 --> 01:02:32.691
We're not doing that again, are we?

01:02:32.901 --> 01:02:34.026
You should see this.

01:02:34.235 --> 01:02:37.738
It's the latest report on those
Japanese troop transports.

01:02:42.494 --> 01:02:43.911
Remember those troop ships?

01:02:44.162 --> 01:02:46.538
They're still heading south
with an escort...

01:02:46.748 --> 01:02:50.042
...only 14 hours
from the coast of Malaya.

01:02:53.171 --> 01:02:55.005
What about their aircraft carriers?

01:02:55.215 --> 01:02:56.715
We don't know.

01:02:57.425 --> 01:03:00.969
Intelligence was keeping track
of them until recently.

01:03:01.179 --> 01:03:03.013
Now we've lost them.

01:03:03.473 --> 01:03:07.476
Look, Rufe, try to put yourself
in their minds.

01:03:07.685 --> 01:03:11.855
Where do you think I have been
the past week, night and day?

01:03:12.690 --> 01:03:16.026
I am still convinced
they're going to attack us.

01:03:18.112 --> 01:03:20.322
What can we do that we
aren't doing already?

01:03:22.325 --> 01:03:25.452
I don't know about you,
but I know what I'm gonna do.

01:03:27.539 --> 01:03:28.872
Where is everybody?

01:03:29.123 --> 01:03:31.750
Oh, it's past 12, sir.
They've already gone.

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:33.961
- Get them back.
- On the weekend?

01:03:34.212 --> 01:03:36.046
Yes, on the weekend.

01:03:41.303 --> 01:03:44.556
"Only specially screened members
of your communications staff..."

01:03:45.683 --> 01:03:49.352
...are to be permitted to process
the 14-part message...

01:03:49.853 --> 01:03:53.439
"...and prepare the typed translation."

01:03:59.321 --> 01:04:02.657
It will be difficult without
the help of a skilled typist.

01:04:03.367 --> 01:04:06.035
The situation right now
is extremely delicate.

01:04:07.413 --> 01:04:09.080
We must be prepared...

01:04:09.248 --> 01:04:13.209
...to have each part of the message
decoded as soon as it comes in.

01:04:14.461 --> 01:04:16.254
I'll alert the code room.

01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:29.976
We'll reach Point D soon, sir.

01:04:43.115 --> 01:04:46.743
From Point D proceed to Point E.
Battle speed.

01:05:15.522 --> 01:05:17.649
So this is the sound of Hawaii?

01:05:29.286 --> 01:05:33.831
Disappointing news, our main targets,
the American carriers...

01:05:34.333 --> 01:05:36.626
...have left Pearl Harbor.

01:05:44.343 --> 01:05:46.094
This completes 13 parts?

01:05:46.303 --> 01:05:49.931
Yes, Tokyo is holding
the final part till morning.

01:05:50.557 --> 01:05:52.350
I wonder why.

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:55.687
It's almost 9.

01:05:55.979 --> 01:05:59.774
Harry, I'm going to make the rounds
with what we have here.

01:05:59.983 --> 01:06:03.152
Thank God the president's
back on the list.

01:06:04.697 --> 01:06:07.699
Have Brotherhood call me
when the missing part is in.

01:06:07.866 --> 01:06:09.325
Right.

01:06:29.221 --> 01:06:30.722
You're late.

01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:34.183
- Well, I was...
- Please, take me to the White House.

01:06:44.570 --> 01:06:48.740
If you told me we were invited
to the White House, I would've dressed.

01:06:50.367 --> 01:06:51.993
You know Mrs. Roosevelt.

01:06:52.202 --> 01:06:55.538
She's informal personally,
but a stickler for protocol...

01:06:55.748 --> 01:06:58.666
Darling, will you shut up and drive?

01:07:37.623 --> 01:07:38.915
Once more!

01:07:46.924 --> 01:07:54.924
Steady.

01:08:04.650 --> 01:08:07.151
Great! We just sank the Nevada!

01:08:12.825 --> 01:08:14.158
Pennsylvania!

01:08:17.662 --> 01:08:19.287
Oklahoma!

01:08:23.710 --> 01:08:27.964
No, you idiot!
It's your own flagship!

01:08:42.854 --> 01:08:44.354
Well?

01:08:44.773 --> 01:08:46.732
Captain Wilkinson's.

01:08:53.156 --> 01:08:54.823
Did you see the president?

01:08:55.033 --> 01:08:58.743
No, I saw Harry Hopkins.

01:08:58.953 --> 01:09:01.162
And did he read the whatever it is?

01:09:01.747 --> 01:09:04.709
No, he doesn't have the key.

01:09:05.669 --> 01:09:08.462
I gave the pouch to our Naval aide,
Lieutenant Schulz.

01:09:08.671 --> 01:09:10.673
He took it in to the president.

01:09:11.174 --> 01:09:13.885
And the president has a key,
I suppose?

01:09:15.386 --> 01:09:17.013
Of course he has.

01:09:17.639 --> 01:09:20.390
And did Lieutenant Schulz
say anything?

01:09:20.725 --> 01:09:22.184
He said, "Thank you."

01:09:22.895 --> 01:09:25.145
Darling, step on it, will you?

01:09:32.904 --> 01:09:36.908
If we can see nothing, then neither
can American patrol planes.

01:09:37.701 --> 01:09:40.161
I'm more concerned about
a submarine detecting us.

01:09:52.674 --> 01:09:54.759
Dead on schedule.

01:10:04.895 --> 01:10:08.689
Admiral Stark can't be reached.
Should I take it to chief of staff?

01:10:08.899 --> 01:10:12.944
It's after 10, General Marshall
always retires early.

01:10:21.328 --> 01:10:26.123
I see no reason to disturb Marshall
with something that's incomplete.

01:10:26.708 --> 01:10:31.295
- Wait till you have the final part.
- Yes, sir.

01:10:31.630 --> 01:10:32.880
If you're so concerned...

01:10:33.090 --> 01:10:36.258
...why don't we call chief of war plans,
Admiral Turner?

01:10:36.468 --> 01:10:39.095
His telephone doesn't answer, sir.

01:10:39.304 --> 01:10:42.431
- You don't happen to know where he is?
- No idea.

01:10:53.276 --> 01:10:57.071
The president has already
discussed it with me.

01:10:57.322 --> 01:11:00.282
He sent a personal message
to the emperor.

01:11:00.492 --> 01:11:04.787
But when the final part of this
comes in, I'd like to see it then.

01:11:04.997 --> 01:11:08.374
- Good night, commander.
- Good night, sir.

01:11:17.759 --> 01:11:19.969
I was starved. I'll bet you are.

01:11:20.178 --> 01:11:22.346
Oh, thank you, dear.

01:11:25.851 --> 01:11:28.019
Can't you tell me anything?

01:11:28.186 --> 01:11:29.687
Even a hint?

01:11:34.151 --> 01:11:37.278
You'd think the world was falling apart.

01:11:37.487 --> 01:11:40.364
Admiral Stark talked to the president.

01:11:41.491 --> 01:11:43.451
What did the president say?

01:11:46.371 --> 01:11:49.707
He sent a personal message
to the emperor.

01:12:19.071 --> 01:12:20.321
Gordy.

01:12:21.573 --> 01:12:24.700
We got those B-17s coming in
from California in the morning.

01:12:24.951 --> 01:12:27.661
Honolulu radio will stay on
the air all night...

01:12:27.871 --> 01:12:29.330
...so the planes can home in.

01:12:29.539 --> 01:12:33.334
You and I had better be in that
control tower at 7:30 sharp.

01:12:33.543 --> 01:12:34.877
Yes, sir.

01:12:43.970 --> 01:12:47.515
- Tyler, I've got a job for you.
- Sir.

01:12:47.724 --> 01:12:51.602
Report to the new radar center
at Fort Shafter at 0400.

01:12:51.770 --> 01:12:53.604
At 4:00 in the morning?

01:12:53.855 --> 01:12:55.606
From 4 to 7 a.m.

01:12:55.857 --> 01:12:58.984
Our marvel of science
only operates for three hours.

01:12:59.194 --> 01:13:01.779
Lucky boy. Lucky boy!

01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:16.627
Captain, how's it feel?
First command, first patrol.

01:13:16.878 --> 01:13:18.921
Just fine, Mr. Young.

01:13:23.093 --> 01:13:26.303
In fact, I think I'll turn in for a while.

01:13:31.977 --> 01:13:34.019
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

01:13:42.654 --> 01:13:46.490
The Commander-in-Chief
has sent a message...

01:13:46.658 --> 01:13:49.285
...wishing us good luck.

01:13:49.953 --> 01:13:53.497
That, plus the lmperial Proclamation...

01:13:53.665 --> 01:13:58.043
...has undoubtedly stirred
your loyalty to the Empire.

01:13:59.462 --> 01:14:02.006
The success of this mission...

01:14:02.174 --> 01:14:05.176
...depends on surprise.
If we achieve it...

01:14:06.052 --> 01:14:09.263
...the code words "Tora, Tora, Tora,"
will be sent out.

01:14:11.266 --> 01:14:15.853
Now that the hour for battle
draws near...

01:14:17.105 --> 01:14:20.482
...I will not burden you
with the usual pep talk.

01:14:21.818 --> 01:14:25.696
Instead I shall hoist
the famous "Z" flag...

01:14:27.365 --> 01:14:32.453
...beneath which, Commander-in-Chief
Togo led his fleet to victory...

01:14:33.163 --> 01:14:35.706
...in the historic battle
against the Russians.

01:15:27.175 --> 01:15:28.550
Here you are.

01:15:29.427 --> 01:15:30.511
Kramer.

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:32.263
Al, listen to this.

01:15:32.514 --> 01:15:34.056
The 14th part.

01:15:34.266 --> 01:15:36.934
"Will the ambassadors please
submit our reply..."

01:15:37.143 --> 01:15:40.771
...to the United States government
at precisely 1 p.m...

01:15:41.064 --> 01:15:43.065
"...December 7th, your time."

01:15:43.441 --> 01:15:45.025
1 p.m.?

01:15:45.277 --> 01:15:49.154
"Precisely 1 p.m., your time."

01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:51.782
I'll be right over.

01:16:10.927 --> 01:16:14.430
Look at the president's message.
I should have had it hours ago.

01:16:14.639 --> 01:16:17.474
As you know, communications
have been delayed...

01:16:17.684 --> 01:16:19.393
...and frequently garbled lately.

01:16:19.602 --> 01:16:22.313
Or deliberately interfered with.

01:16:24.899 --> 01:16:28.986
Gene, call the foreign minister.

01:16:30.989 --> 01:16:34.408
Tell him I want an immediate
audience with the emperor.

01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:40.497
Why is this so important?

01:16:41.166 --> 01:16:43.959
Does this Roosevelt message
say anything new?

01:16:53.011 --> 01:16:55.721
It merely proposes
a heart-to-heart exchange...

01:16:56.348 --> 01:16:58.474
...between the two Chiefs of State.

01:17:00.602 --> 01:17:02.978
It could start negotiations afresh.

01:17:13.323 --> 01:17:14.865
It's too late for that.

01:17:17.118 --> 01:17:21.538
It's just as well the message
didn't come a day or two earlier.

01:17:25.043 --> 01:17:27.711
What do I tell Ambassador Grew?

01:17:28.380 --> 01:17:30.381
You are Foreign Minister!

01:17:31.466 --> 01:17:34.343
Report to the palace alone
with the message.

01:17:39.391 --> 01:17:41.517
"After deciphering..."

01:17:43.186 --> 01:17:45.062
...part 14...

01:17:46.523 --> 01:17:48.690
...destroy at once...

01:17:50.735 --> 01:17:55.197
...your cipher machine...

01:17:56.908 --> 01:17:58.909
...all codes...

01:18:00.161 --> 01:18:04.248
"...and secret documents."

01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:07.334
Translate this immediately.

01:18:07.502 --> 01:18:10.087
- Give a copy to Kramer when he comes.
- Yes, sir.

01:18:10.296 --> 01:18:12.089
I've got to get the hell out of here.

01:19:32.921 --> 01:19:34.588
Hey, look at this.

01:19:35.381 --> 01:19:37.299
Finally got one.

01:19:42.347 --> 01:19:43.514
Communication center.

01:19:43.681 --> 01:19:44.848
It even works.

01:19:45.016 --> 01:19:46.308
That's great.

01:19:46.518 --> 01:19:49.144
Opana Point, communications check.

01:19:51.022 --> 01:19:52.356
Are you reading us?

01:19:52.524 --> 01:19:54.650
Coming in loud and clear.

01:19:59.614 --> 01:20:00.697
Where's the general?

01:20:00.949 --> 01:20:02.866
It's Sunday, sir.

01:20:17.632 --> 01:20:19.132
This is Colonel Bratton.

01:20:19.384 --> 01:20:22.344
Connect me with Chief of Staff,
General Marshall.

01:20:22.554 --> 01:20:25.722
Yes, at his quarters, Fort Myer.

01:20:30.478 --> 01:20:33.397
Chief of staff's quarters,
Sergeant Aguirre speaking.

01:20:34.232 --> 01:20:35.857
Yes, Colonel Bratton.

01:20:37.068 --> 01:20:39.570
I'm sorry, sir, the general isn't here.

01:20:40.446 --> 01:20:43.365
Where he always is
this time Sunday morning.

01:21:00.425 --> 01:21:03.510
- Where's Colonel Bratton?
- Gone to see General Marshall.

01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:05.762
He left this for you, sir.

01:21:39.339 --> 01:21:41.298
Here is another part of the message, sir.

01:21:53.144 --> 01:21:57.814
We are instructed to submit
the message at 1:00 p.m. today.

01:22:01.569 --> 01:22:02.986
One p.m.?

01:22:05.531 --> 01:22:09.117
The 14th part of this intercept
Kramer just delivered...

01:22:09.285 --> 01:22:12.287
...indicates to me
the Japanese are going to attack.

01:22:14.832 --> 01:22:16.500
None of us doubt war is coming.

01:22:16.668 --> 01:22:20.295
We know they have
an expeditionary force heading south.

01:22:21.422 --> 01:22:24.633
Sir, as hostilities seem imminent...

01:22:24.842 --> 01:22:27.177
...l recommend you telephone
Admiral Kimmel...

01:22:27.428 --> 01:22:29.137
...in Hawaii.

01:22:46.948 --> 01:22:48.365
No.

01:22:50.368 --> 01:22:52.953
I better call the president first.

01:22:55.373 --> 01:22:57.457
Now, if you'll all please excuse me?

01:22:57.667 --> 01:23:00.585
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

01:26:14.739 --> 01:26:18.700
The men are in good spirits, sir.
They are eager to go.

01:26:21.245 --> 01:26:25.081
Yes, they are eager because they
do not know the taste of battle.

01:27:09.251 --> 01:27:13.380
The mechanics asked me to give you
this for good luck at Pearl Harbor.

01:28:27.246 --> 01:28:28.997
Bring her into the wind.

01:32:06.298 --> 01:32:09.259
"The Japanese government regrets
to have to notify..."

01:32:09.426 --> 01:32:11.302
...the American government...

01:32:11.553 --> 01:32:14.597
...that, in view of the attitude
of the American government...

01:32:14.765 --> 01:32:16.933
...it is impossible to reach...

01:32:18.769 --> 01:32:20.478
"...an agreement
through negotiations."

01:32:20.646 --> 01:32:21.688
Sir?

01:32:21.855 --> 01:32:24.941
- There are supplemental messages.
- Thank you.

01:32:36.203 --> 01:32:39.414
Gentlemen, I am convinced
the Japanese intend to attack...

01:32:39.623 --> 01:32:42.083
...at or shortly after 1:00 today.

01:32:42.293 --> 01:32:45.336
- I'll alert all Pacific commands.
- Yes, sir.

01:32:55.597 --> 01:32:57.974
Colonel Bratton, just a minute.

01:32:58.309 --> 01:33:00.852
Take this to communications center.

01:33:20.789 --> 01:33:23.166
We will follow that ship
into Pearl Harbor.

01:33:33.844 --> 01:33:35.345
Come in.

01:33:36.180 --> 01:33:38.181
Captain, can you come to the bridge?

01:33:38.349 --> 01:33:39.974
Very well.

01:33:44.688 --> 01:33:46.189
Sub contact, Mr. Goepner?

01:33:46.398 --> 01:33:47.857
- We're not sure.
- What ship?

01:33:48.067 --> 01:33:50.193
The Navy tug Antares.

01:33:51.487 --> 01:33:53.029
Look astern of her, captain.

01:33:54.365 --> 01:33:56.074
She's towing a target raft.

01:33:56.367 --> 01:33:58.785
Look between the ship
and the raft, sir.

01:34:08.504 --> 01:34:10.838
That, Mr. Goepner, is a submarine.

01:34:11.048 --> 01:34:14.384
She's sneaking through the net
into the harbor. General Quarters.

01:34:14.551 --> 01:34:17.220
- Sound General Quarters.
- All engines ahead, full.

01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:39.909
- Come left 15 degrees.
- Come left 15 degrees, sir.

01:34:40.244 --> 01:34:43.121
- Tell Antares we're attacking.
- Aye, aye, sir.

01:34:48.252 --> 01:34:50.711
Flags, tell Antares we're attacking.

01:34:58.262 --> 01:35:01.431
- Mount one, commence firing.
- Mount one, commence firing.

01:35:20.617 --> 01:35:23.995
- Stand by to roll depth charges.
- Stand by to roll depth charges.

01:35:28.959 --> 01:35:30.877
- Roll one.
- Roll one.

01:35:39.136 --> 01:35:41.304
- Roll two.
- Roll two.

01:35:55.652 --> 01:36:00.114
Notify Com-14 we dropped depth charges
on a sub in our security zone.

01:36:00.324 --> 01:36:01.824
Aye, aye, sir.

01:36:21.178 --> 01:36:22.678
Captain Earle speaking.

01:36:23.180 --> 01:36:26.933
- We have a message from the ward.
- All right, read it to me.

01:36:27.726 --> 01:36:33.022
"Have dropped depth charges on sub
operating in our security zone."

01:36:34.316 --> 01:36:37.568
We've had so many of these
false sightings, Kaminsky.

01:36:37.819 --> 01:36:39.570
But this is the real thing, sir.

01:36:39.821 --> 01:36:41.739
Closer than any previous sighting.

01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:43.449
Just off the harbor entrance.

01:36:44.451 --> 01:36:47.745
You and I know the skipper
of that destroyer is a green kid.

01:36:47.913 --> 01:36:49.372
I'll pass it to Admiral Block.

01:36:49.581 --> 01:36:53.584
With all due respect, sir, I think
we should alert all commanders.

01:36:54.211 --> 01:36:59.382
Confirmation, Kaminsky.
I want confirmation.

01:37:22.239 --> 01:37:26.200
The sunburst reminds me
of our flag, a good omen.

01:37:50.517 --> 01:37:52.435
Ed, this is hot.

01:37:52.644 --> 01:37:56.314
General Marshall wants it sent to
all commanders by the fastest route.

01:37:56.565 --> 01:37:58.024
Right.

01:38:01.612 --> 01:38:05.031
The general's handwriting,
it's hard to read.

01:38:06.783 --> 01:38:09.243
You're gonna have to help me
with it, Rufe.

01:39:03.674 --> 01:39:06.175
Hey, I'm picking up Honolulu
on the radio.

01:39:06.843 --> 01:39:09.011
Check your direction-finder dial.

01:39:12.140 --> 01:39:15.017
It's coming from five degrees
to port, sir.

01:39:16.186 --> 01:39:18.354
Okay, keep riding that beam.

01:39:42.337 --> 01:39:46.006
Major, I picked up
some great music from Honolulu.

01:39:46.425 --> 01:39:48.634
That's fine, pipe it through.

01:39:51.722 --> 01:39:53.097
Okay.

01:40:08.071 --> 01:40:10.573
Where's the damn chow truck?

01:40:13.243 --> 01:40:16.245
Shut the thing down, George.
It's already after 7.

01:40:16.455 --> 01:40:18.372
Hey, Joe, come here.

01:40:19.082 --> 01:40:20.583
What do you make of that?

01:40:20.792 --> 01:40:22.752
I've been watching it for minutes.

01:40:22.919 --> 01:40:24.754
It's moving in, fast.

01:40:24.963 --> 01:40:27.089
I've never seen anything that big.

01:40:27.382 --> 01:40:30.301
- Looks like two main pulses.
- Hey, Joe, I got it.

01:40:30.552 --> 01:40:35.723
I make that about 140 miles north,
three degrees east.

01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:39.560
Don't make sense,
we got no planes out that far.

01:40:39.895 --> 01:40:41.937
We gotta contact
the information center.

01:40:42.189 --> 01:40:44.273
Our problem is over at 7:00.

01:40:44.483 --> 01:40:47.109
The center might make
some sense out of it.

01:40:47.611 --> 01:40:49.779
Okay, suit yourself.

01:40:59.623 --> 01:41:01.457
Information center.

01:41:02.501 --> 01:41:06.337
Yeah? I don't know, Mac,
we're all closed down here.

01:41:07.130 --> 01:41:09.340
Is that right? Hang on a minute.

01:41:09.591 --> 01:41:11.300
Lieutenant, sir.

01:41:18.850 --> 01:41:19.975
Lieutenant Tyler.

01:41:20.143 --> 01:41:22.728
Sir, this is Private Elliot, Opana Point.

01:41:22.938 --> 01:41:25.356
There's a large formation
of planes coming in...

01:41:25.607 --> 01:41:28.359
...140 miles, three degrees east.

01:41:28.777 --> 01:41:30.152
Yeah?

01:41:31.029 --> 01:41:34.615
Well, don't worry about it.

01:41:37.118 --> 01:41:40.162
The boys at Opana Point must have
picked up the B-17s...

01:41:40.372 --> 01:41:41.997
...coming in from the mainland.

01:41:43.875 --> 01:41:47.461
- He said not to worry about it.
- Come on, let's go eat.

01:41:55.011 --> 01:41:59.515
Colonel, I sent this to Manila,
the canal zone and San Francisco...

01:41:59.683 --> 01:42:02.351
...but the direct channel
to Hawaii is out.

01:42:02.561 --> 01:42:04.186
Atmospherics again?

01:42:04.396 --> 01:42:07.147
Yes, sir, it's real bad today.

01:42:07.357 --> 01:42:09.567
We could give it to the Navy.

01:42:09.818 --> 01:42:12.820
What makes you think
their atmospherics are better?

01:42:15.031 --> 01:42:18.200
- Send it as a telegram.
- Yes, sir.

01:42:25.542 --> 01:42:30.045
Our ultimatum should be delivered in
Washington before the attack begins.

01:42:33.008 --> 01:42:34.800
I hope everything is on schedule.

01:42:35.302 --> 01:42:37.386
Don't worry, sir.
The Emperor insists...

01:42:37.721 --> 01:42:41.015
...that we follow the rules
of the Geneva Convention.

01:42:41.349 --> 01:42:43.392
Our declaration of war
will be delivered...

01:42:43.852 --> 01:42:46.729
...at 1:00 p.m.,
30 minutes before the attack begins.

01:43:11.338 --> 01:43:14.256
The typing still isn't finished.

01:43:15.842 --> 01:43:20.054
We'll have to postpone our 1:00
appointment with Secretary Hull.

01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:27.061
Do you mean a submarine was
sighted over half an hour ago...

01:43:27.270 --> 01:43:30.439
...and that it's taken
this long to report it to me?

01:43:31.441 --> 01:43:34.777
I don't care if it
still hasn't been confirmed.

01:43:34.945 --> 01:43:38.739
I should've been informed after
the ward radioed a first report.

01:43:38.949 --> 01:43:42.785
A submarine that close is a serious matter.
A very serious matter.

01:43:42.953 --> 01:43:45.788
Get the confirmation,
all the reports to my office.

01:43:45.956 --> 01:43:49.375
I mean, right now.
Have my driver get the car.

01:43:49.584 --> 01:43:51.126
Aye, aye, sir. Oh, sir...

01:43:51.378 --> 01:43:54.296
...should I tell General Short
you'll miss the golf date?

01:43:54.506 --> 01:43:57.466
No, damn it, get my car.

01:44:03.306 --> 01:44:05.641
A message for the general
at Fort Shafter.

01:44:05.892 --> 01:44:08.477
- Is it marked urgent?
- No.

01:45:01.072 --> 01:45:02.948
It's a little bumpy, Davey...

01:45:03.158 --> 01:45:05.492
...but you have to fly
in all kinds of weather.

01:45:05.702 --> 01:45:07.453
Sure, Miss Fort.

01:45:25.055 --> 01:45:27.014
Don't let the nose drop.

01:45:27.223 --> 01:45:31.351
That's better. You're doing just fine.

01:45:51.122 --> 01:45:53.415
I'm taking over, Davey.

01:46:14.312 --> 01:46:19.108
Warrant Officer Mizuki,
signal all planes, "prepare to attack."

01:46:25.240 --> 01:46:28.575
A signal from Fuchida,
"objective sighted, preparing to attack."

01:47:14.455 --> 01:47:16.373
Everything is strangely quiet.

01:47:18.334 --> 01:47:22.171
The American anti-aircraft
batteries haven't fired a shot!

01:47:26.634 --> 01:47:29.386
And no enemy fighters
over the harbor, sir!

01:47:35.185 --> 01:47:36.852
We've done it!

01:47:40.356 --> 01:47:43.525
Send the message:
"Tora! Tora! Tora!"

01:47:49.616 --> 01:47:51.241
"Tora! Tora! Tora!"

01:48:52.095 --> 01:48:53.887
Stand by.

01:49:59.746 --> 01:50:01.330
Execute.

01:50:59.514 --> 01:51:02.724
Get his number.
I'll report him for safety violations.

01:51:37.260 --> 01:51:38.593
Come on!

01:51:44.225 --> 01:51:46.935
Alert all commands:

01:51:48.062 --> 01:51:51.064
"Air raid. Pearl Harbor.

01:51:51.732 --> 01:51:54.359
This is no drill."

01:52:24.348 --> 01:52:27.309
General Quarters. General Quarters.

01:52:27.768 --> 01:52:31.271
Man your stations. Man your stations.

01:52:37.695 --> 01:52:38.987
Sir.

01:52:56.506 --> 01:52:58.840
Battle stations. Battle stations.

01:53:07.350 --> 01:53:10.852
Fire your gun. Fire at will.

01:53:11.521 --> 01:53:12.521
That bastard!

01:53:30.540 --> 01:53:33.166
Station six, man your pump.

01:53:44.345 --> 01:53:45.595
Plane to starboard.

01:54:00.695 --> 01:54:02.279
Pearl Harbor is being attacked.

01:54:02.530 --> 01:54:05.073
- Pearl Harbor?
- Pearl Harbor is being bombed.

01:54:05.283 --> 01:54:06.866
Pearl Harbor's being attacked.

01:54:07.076 --> 01:54:10.370
Go back to your quarters.
Pearl Harbor's being attacked.

01:54:52.955 --> 01:54:55.290
What in the hell is going on?

01:54:56.459 --> 01:54:58.335
Why wasn't the Army notified?

01:54:58.586 --> 01:55:02.964
Did anyone think to inform Washington?
I thought so.

01:55:03.257 --> 01:55:05.467
- General.
- Put all units on a full war footing.

01:55:05.635 --> 01:55:07.260
Alert the territorial guard.

01:55:07.428 --> 01:55:09.262
Open a command post
at Aliamanu Crater.

01:55:09.430 --> 01:55:11.306
- Yes, sir.
- I'll be right down.

01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:19.356
Oh, my God.

01:55:20.191 --> 01:55:21.441
The island's under attack.

01:55:21.651 --> 01:55:24.152
Those bastards will kill us all.

01:55:25.655 --> 01:55:28.156
Men, get to the armory.
Get guns, ammunition.

01:55:28.324 --> 01:55:30.450
- You too, lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

01:55:36.957 --> 01:55:39.334
- Operator.
- Duarte airfield.

01:55:39.502 --> 01:55:41.628
All the phone lines are jammed.

01:55:41.837 --> 01:55:44.130
Well, try the radio again.

01:56:14.161 --> 01:56:15.203
Hose down that plane.

01:56:30.052 --> 01:56:31.052
Run for it.

01:56:31.262 --> 01:56:32.929
Run, run!

01:56:40.646 --> 01:56:41.688
There's Hickam.

01:56:41.897 --> 01:56:45.066
Major, I heard something
funny on the Honolulu radio.

01:56:49.864 --> 01:56:51.698
What kind of traffic control is this?

01:56:51.907 --> 01:56:54.159
The radio said
something about an attack.

01:56:54.368 --> 01:56:55.910
They're Japs, sir.

01:56:59.915 --> 01:57:03.793
What a way to fly into a war.
Unarmed and out of gas.

01:57:04.044 --> 01:57:05.879
Oboe leader to Oboe flight.

01:57:06.088 --> 01:57:09.090
We've flown into the middle of a war.
Get out fast.

01:57:09.300 --> 01:57:12.761
Anywhere. If you can't make Hickam,
try Bellows or Wheeler.

01:57:24.315 --> 01:57:26.399
Sir, we've been hit. Nothing serious.

01:57:26.609 --> 01:57:28.067
They shot one circuit box.

01:57:28.277 --> 01:57:30.278
The landing light isn't working.

01:57:30.446 --> 01:57:32.614
Better use the hand crank. Hurry.

01:57:56.597 --> 01:57:58.139
- Major.
- Yeah.

01:57:58.307 --> 01:57:59.516
One wheel is stuck.

01:57:59.975 --> 01:58:02.477
Well, jolt it loose. We're going in.

01:58:02.770 --> 01:58:04.813
- L tried.
- Try again!

01:58:08.317 --> 01:58:10.527
Here they come. Fire!

01:58:17.493 --> 01:58:20.161
Tell them to stop shooting at us!
We're Americans.

01:58:27.336 --> 01:58:29.629
Major, no go, sir.

01:58:31.674 --> 01:58:34.843
Like I said, it's a hell of a way
to fly into a war.

01:59:01.871 --> 01:59:03.329
- Run for it!
- Hurry up!

01:59:06.876 --> 01:59:09.043
Tower to B-17,
there's a Jap on your tail.

01:59:09.336 --> 01:59:11.045
Goose your engine and get out.

02:00:49.979 --> 02:00:52.647
Have damage control report
all damages.

02:00:52.815 --> 02:00:55.316
Sir, if we stay here we're gonna fry.

02:00:55.484 --> 02:00:57.819
Okay, sergeant,
let's get the men down.

02:00:57.987 --> 02:01:00.029
All right, you guys, let's go.

02:01:00.489 --> 02:01:02.824
Where the hell are our fighters?

02:01:26.223 --> 02:01:29.851
Captain, the main fuel tanks
are fractured.

02:01:30.144 --> 02:01:32.437
Lower deck's flooded,
we're listing eight degrees.

02:01:32.646 --> 02:01:34.439
Counter flood, counter flood.

02:01:44.950 --> 02:01:47.869
You wanted confirmation, captain?
Take a look.

02:01:48.037 --> 02:01:49.871
There's your confirmation!

02:01:57.463 --> 02:01:59.547
“Oklahoma”, capsized.

02:02:00.883 --> 02:02:03.843
Nevada's taken a torpedo forward
and is down to the head.

02:02:04.053 --> 02:02:08.181
West Virginia, subjected to six
torpedo hits and several deck fires.

02:02:08.390 --> 02:02:10.892
"Raleigh and Helena
damaged and listing."

02:02:11.060 --> 02:02:15.938
The California, two torpedoes,
fires all around, temporarily abandoned.

02:02:16.106 --> 02:02:17.273
I've just come from her.

02:03:30.180 --> 02:03:32.265
It's spent, sir.

02:03:39.815 --> 02:03:42.316
Would've been merciful had it killed me.

02:03:53.287 --> 02:03:55.204
A message from
Flight Leader Fuchida.

02:03:55.622 --> 02:03:59.167
"Have inflicted serious damage
on numerous battleships."

02:04:17.227 --> 02:04:18.686
Better than we had dreamed!

02:04:26.528 --> 02:04:28.362
Where are our priority targets...

02:04:30.199 --> 02:04:32.366
...the American carriers?

02:04:36.872 --> 02:04:38.497
Mr. Secretary.

02:04:40.709 --> 02:04:44.879
"Air raid. Pearl Harbor. This is no drill."

02:04:45.172 --> 02:04:48.424
No, this can't be true.
They must mean the Philippines.

02:04:48.675 --> 02:04:51.886
No, sir. It's Pearl.

02:04:54.181 --> 02:04:56.390
Get me the White House, the direct line.

02:04:56.642 --> 02:04:58.059
Yes, sir.

02:05:03.398 --> 02:05:07.735
Mr. Ambassador, Mr. Hull will see you
in a moment. Please be seated.

02:05:12.407 --> 02:05:16.244
Mr. President, has this been confirmed?

02:05:16.453 --> 02:05:19.455
Then, sir,
I'd like you to have it confirmed...

02:05:19.706 --> 02:05:23.668
...before I receive Nomura and Kurusu.

02:05:23.877 --> 02:05:25.544
They're waiting outside.

02:06:26.815 --> 02:06:31.319
Operator. Operator.
Get me Haleiwa field. Fast.

02:06:31.528 --> 02:06:35.031
George, get ahold of a car,
a truck, anything.

02:06:35.282 --> 02:06:39.618
I'm calling Haleiwa. I'll get them
to start our planes. Go.

02:08:39.406 --> 02:08:41.449
Battleship on the left, sir!

02:08:48.957 --> 02:08:52.460
It's the Nevada. She's making
a run for the sea!

02:08:53.378 --> 02:08:57.631
If we sink her in the channel,
the harbor will be blocked for months!

02:09:08.143 --> 02:09:10.686
Recommend course 2-3-0, sir.

02:09:10.979 --> 02:09:14.148
- Very well. Stay at 2-3-0.
- Stay at 2-3-0, sir.

02:10:00.862 --> 02:10:02.196
Take cover!

02:10:18.838 --> 02:10:20.464
More hose! More hose!

02:10:34.980 --> 02:10:36.480
More water.

02:10:39.693 --> 02:10:42.611
Abandon ship! Abandon ship!

02:10:54.916 --> 02:10:59.128
- Abandon ship! Abandon Ship!
- Over the side!

02:11:03.425 --> 02:11:06.093
Can't get through
the outer channel in this shape.

02:11:06.261 --> 02:11:09.263
She goes down here,
she'll block the south channel.

02:11:09.431 --> 02:11:11.765
We'll have to beach her there
so she's clear.

02:14:58.034 --> 02:14:59.493
File these.

02:15:12.841 --> 02:15:14.341
G-5.

02:15:20.682 --> 02:15:22.683
I need five copies each.

02:15:25.186 --> 02:15:26.770
Messenger.

02:15:28.857 --> 02:15:31.525
- Take this to General Short's office.
- Right.

02:15:32.861 --> 02:15:34.361
File these.

02:15:48.001 --> 02:15:49.376
Corporal.

02:15:49.711 --> 02:15:51.879
This has to be decoded
for the general.

02:15:52.046 --> 02:15:55.048
Take it to the decoding room.
Ask them to send it back soon.

02:15:55.216 --> 02:15:56.717
Yes, sir.

02:16:17.071 --> 02:16:18.614
Run for it!

02:16:25.914 --> 02:16:28.624
Drop the hose
and get the ladders and axes.

02:16:29.626 --> 02:16:30.959
What are you waiting for?

02:16:31.210 --> 02:16:33.085
- We got no water.
- Why? What's wrong?

02:16:33.421 --> 02:16:36.048
It's the Arizona.
She cut the pipes in the mains.

02:16:36.257 --> 02:16:39.217
The tanker in the ocean there
is full of aviation fuel.

02:16:39.427 --> 02:16:41.428
If it goes, we'll blow up
half the harbor.

02:17:46.451 --> 02:17:47.827
Hey, look out!

02:18:07.557 --> 02:18:12.352
In all my 50 years of public service...

02:18:14.022 --> 02:18:18.191
...l have never seen a document
so crowded with infamous falsehoods...

02:18:18.442 --> 02:18:20.192
...and distortions...

02:18:20.861 --> 02:18:23.196
...on a scale so huge...

02:18:23.364 --> 02:18:26.366
...that I never imagined until today...

02:18:27.243 --> 02:18:29.870
...that any government
on this planet...

02:18:30.079 --> 02:18:32.873
...was capable of uttering them.

02:18:46.471 --> 02:18:47.888
Mr. Hull.

02:18:50.058 --> 02:18:51.516
Go.

02:19:56.624 --> 02:20:01.545
What's the matter? Why in hell
doesn't the next wave take off?

02:20:02.296 --> 02:20:05.674
But, sir, no one has given the order.

02:20:21.983 --> 02:20:23.984
We've knocked out
the American airfields...

02:20:24.610 --> 02:20:28.071
...sunk four battleships,
heavily damaged three more.

02:20:34.328 --> 02:20:37.831
Sir, Rear Admiral Yamaguchi's
carrier has signaled!

02:20:38.291 --> 02:20:41.585
"Attack group ready for takeoff."

02:20:51.512 --> 02:20:55.515
Unfortunately, the American
carriers were not at Pearl Harbor.

02:20:57.685 --> 02:20:59.895
Since we don't know where they are...

02:21:00.396 --> 02:21:03.899
...we can't use our limited
supply of fuel to look for them.

02:21:05.610 --> 02:21:10.197
We must not forget that enemy
submarines will be searching for us.

02:21:12.200 --> 02:21:14.367
We have been lucky so far.

02:21:17.121 --> 02:21:18.747
No take-off signal yet?

02:21:19.123 --> 02:21:20.749
There is a signal now!

02:21:27.048 --> 02:21:30.133
It says, "All ships head for Japan
as soon as our planes return."

02:21:39.894 --> 02:21:40.936
It can't be!

02:21:44.357 --> 02:21:45.774
It must be a mistake!

02:21:51.656 --> 02:21:53.740
We cannot turn back now.

02:21:55.076 --> 02:21:58.954
We must destroy the American
carriers and their dry docks...

02:21:59.413 --> 02:22:00.914
...no matter how long it takes!

02:22:01.540 --> 02:22:06.086
You're wrong. Our mission has
been completely accomplished.

02:22:08.256 --> 02:22:12.926
This task force is vital to us.
It is my duty to return it intact.

02:22:20.977 --> 02:22:24.104
This war is just beginning.

02:22:27.608 --> 02:22:29.776
We have a long way to go.

02:22:52.633 --> 02:22:54.426
Yes, all right.

02:22:54.635 --> 02:22:58.805
This came from the decoding room,
a cablegram from the War Department.

02:23:11.944 --> 02:23:14.321
Get a copy to Admiral Kimmel.

02:23:31.881 --> 02:23:33.173
Pardon me, admiral.

02:23:33.382 --> 02:23:35.842
- From Washington.
- Thank you.

02:23:43.351 --> 02:23:45.018
Gentlemen.

02:23:51.400 --> 02:23:54.819
"The Japanese are presenting
at 1 p.m..."

02:23:55.029 --> 02:23:57.489
...Eastern Standard Time today...

02:23:58.199 --> 02:24:00.533
...what amounts to an ultimatum.

02:24:02.870 --> 02:24:07.874
Just what significance the hour set
may have, we do not know...

02:24:09.919 --> 02:24:12.879
"...but be on alert accordingly."

02:24:14.382 --> 02:24:15.882
Signed...

02:24:16.509 --> 02:24:20.845
...George C. Marshall, chief of staff.

02:24:29.939 --> 02:24:31.856
My God.

02:24:47.331 --> 02:24:51.251
This leaves the Navy with only two
combat groups in the Central Pacific.

02:24:51.544 --> 02:24:53.837
Ours and the Lexington.

02:24:54.255 --> 02:24:56.256
We don't want to get caught
like they did.

02:24:56.465 --> 02:24:59.843
I don't intend to.
When can you be ready for sea again?

02:25:00.052 --> 02:25:03.221
We can fuel and provision
and be under way before dawn.

02:25:03.431 --> 02:25:06.474
Good. That's good.

02:25:16.944 --> 02:25:20.780
Here is an announcement from the Navy
Department, released December 7th.

02:25:22.116 --> 02:25:26.244
"Before daybreak today,
the Imperial Navy successfully launched...

02:25:26.745 --> 02:25:31.291
...a large-scale air raid against
the American Pacific Fleet in Hawaii."

02:25:31.917 --> 02:25:34.669
We salute the Commander-in-Chief
of our Fleet...

02:25:34.837 --> 02:25:37.380
...Admiral Yamamoto.

02:25:54.315 --> 02:25:58.276
I had intended to deal a fatal blow
to the American fleet...

02:25:58.986 --> 02:26:01.154
...by attacking Pearl Harbor...

02:26:01.822 --> 02:26:05.325
...immediately after Japan's
official declaration of war.

02:26:10.539 --> 02:26:14.918
But according to the American radio,
Pearl Harbor was attacked...

02:26:15.669 --> 02:26:18.838
...55 minutes before our ultimatum...

02:26:19.423 --> 02:26:22.050
...was delivered in Washington.

02:26:26.138 --> 02:26:28.014
I can't imagine anything...

02:26:29.934 --> 02:26:32.227
...that would infuriate
the Americans more.

02:26:37.316 --> 02:26:39.526
I fear all we have done...

02:26:40.736 --> 02:26:44.948
...is to awaken a sleeping giant
and fill him with a terrible resolve.
