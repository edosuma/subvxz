15:29.846 --> 15:32.838
You're gonna go up against
all of them? You don't
even know if Nathan's here.

15:32.933 --> 15:35.470
Nathan's here.
He's probably
sweating bullets.

15:35.560 --> 15:39.098
Trying not to show it.
This whole program
was his idea.

15:39.189 --> 15:41.555
It means that his ass
is on the line.

15:41.650 --> 15:43.641
You go back,
thelekHlyou.

15:43.735 --> 15:45.271
You have a better idea?

15:45.362 --> 15:46.522
Maybe.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.989
I know Nathan, too,
and not like a brother.
I know the way he thinks.

15:51.409 --> 15:52.945
That's 'cause
you slept with him.

15:53.036 --> 15:54.697
Yeah, and I think
the same way.

15:57.290 --> 16:00.202
What are you
doing here, Dad?
Doing myjob.

16:00.293 --> 16:03.706
You still haven't
told me how you were
on that plane, Claire.

16:03.797 --> 16:05.913
l was grabbed by
your goon squad.

16:06.007 --> 16:09.374
Dad number two tried to
send me home, but I don't
walk out on my friends.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.755
Or help people sick enough
to do something like this.

16:11.847 --> 16:14.259
You have no idea
how big this mission is

16:14.349 --> 16:16.305
and what these people
will do once
you're on their radar.

16:16.393 --> 16:20.011
Don't. I'm not gonna be
your excuse any more.

16:20.105 --> 16:23.643
You know these guys.
Peter. Matt.

16:23.733 --> 16:27.100
Hiro Nakamura, of all people.
You chained them up
like animals.

16:27.195 --> 16:28.810
I've made
certain arrangements.

16:28.989 --> 16:31.196
(LAUGHING)
Arrangements that would
guarantee your safety

16:31.283 --> 16:32.693
and the safety
of this family.

16:32.784 --> 16:36.948
But these abilities have
got to be controlled.

16:37.038 --> 16:40.622
l have an ability.
Does that mean that
l have to be controlled?

16:40.750 --> 16:43.332
No, Claire.
You're missing the...
I'm one of them.

16:45.380 --> 16:46.495
So is he.

16:46.590 --> 16:48.546
Transportation's set.

16:48.633 --> 16:51.215
Young lady,
you're headed back
to Costa Verde.

16:51.303 --> 16:56.093
So that's it. ljust dance
away to college, pretend
everything is all hunky-dory?

16:57.309 --> 16:58.890
Something like that.
Yeah.

17:00.645 --> 17:05.605
So I get a pass,
and everyone I know
just disappears.

17:06.401 --> 17:10.485
Except for Senator Skyboy,
of course, because he's got
everything under control.

17:11.865 --> 17:13.947
I'm walking
a fine line here.

17:15.035 --> 17:16.866
Balancing the security
of this country

17:16.953 --> 17:18.363
against a serious threat.
(SCOFFING) Stop.

17:18.455 --> 17:20.571
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

17:22.250 --> 17:23.751
Either one of you.

17:27.672 --> 17:29.378
Stay put for just a minute.

17:34.012 --> 17:35.843
We talked about this
when I came onboard.

17:35.931 --> 17:38.923
And I will take orders,
and I will do
what has to be done.

17:39.017 --> 17:40.723
But you gotta put
a leash on your hunter.

17:40.810 --> 17:43.722
I haven't forgotten
what we've discussed.

17:43.813 --> 17:47.931
Don't worry about him.
He's useful until he's not.

Damn it!
I want her found.

17:56.034 --> 17:58.446
Don't forget our arrangement.
Keep her out of this.

17:58.536 --> 17:59.992
You keep her out of this.

18:01.122 --> 18:03.454
Daughter or not,
she is running
out of favors.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.787
I wouldn't let
anything happen to her.

18:06.878 --> 18:09.836
What would your hunter do
if he knew you were
one of them, too?

18:15.011 --> 18:16.467
My mistake?

18:18.848 --> 18:21.806
That I expected my people
to act responsibly.

18:22.852 --> 18:25.594
Nobody could have
anticipated what
happened on that hillside.

18:33.321 --> 18:35.277
Wait, Matt.
We can't go
down there.

18:35.365 --> 18:37.856
But this is the place
from the drawing. I know it.

18:38.702 --> 18:40.488
This is where
she was shot.

18:40.578 --> 18:42.159
Matt.
Ando.

18:42.247 --> 18:44.488
How did you get here?
The speedster brought me.

18:44.582 --> 18:47.369
We're looking
for you and Hiro.
She was here.

18:47.877 --> 18:49.208

18:59.389 --> 19:01.880
Something brought
them together
at the crash site.

19:03.059 --> 19:05.050
I imagine some of them
had the misguided idea

19:05.145 --> 19:07.431
that they could still
stop this whole thing.

19:07.522 --> 19:10.264
Guys, we really gotta
get out of here.

19:10.734 --> 19:14.602
She's right. We gotta move.
I can't carry
all these people at once.

19:15.905 --> 19:17.941
Don't worry.
I'm just gonna do
a quick recon,

19:18.074 --> 19:19.575
and find
the safest way to...

19:23.913 --> 19:25.869
Danko's men
totally over-reacted.

19:27.292 --> 19:30.284
Once they opened fire,
they were all out for blood.

19:30.378 --> 19:33.836
When they went after
Claire, it’s when / knew
Danko had lost control.

19:33.923 --> 19:35.208
No!

19:35.300 --> 19:37.211
Parkman must have
got inside
the shooter’s head

19:37.302 --> 19:39.634
and forced him to
turn on his own men,

19:41.348 --> 19:42.929

a bloodbath.

that pathetic alimony
check I found,

quite sometime ago.

'cause you care, kid?

you'd like nothing more

What's in here.

28:21.659 --> 28:23.069
The Will.

28:24.078 --> 28:28.162
I love my son.
ljust want him
to be happy.

28:28.249 --> 28:30.456
Well, he's not.

28:30.626 --> 28:31.957
(SIGHS)

28:34.714 --> 28:37.421
You lie, Luke, because
you'd rather be anyone
else other than yourself.

28:37.508 --> 28:40.250
That's why you got into
that fight. That kid could
be dead, with your ability.

28:40.344 --> 28:43.836
The only reason he's alive
is because of your kindness,
and that scares you.

28:43.931 --> 28:45.262
I want you to tell me
about this power

28:45.349 --> 28:47.886
and everything you know
about the man who
lived down the street.

28:47.977 --> 28:49.513
(GRUNTING)

28:49.604 --> 28:50.810
Wait.

28:52.023 --> 28:53.308
Stop!

28:58.571 --> 29:00.311
Stop it! Luke, stop!

29:01.908 --> 29:03.569
(SOBBING) You killed him.

29:03.659 --> 29:04.944
(SIGHS)

29:05.036 --> 29:08.028
He was gonna...
He was gonna save us.

29:12.209 --> 29:14.074
What are you?

29:25.973 --> 29:27.133
Hey.

29:28.392 --> 29:30.428
Hey. Take me with you.

29:31.479 --> 29:32.719
(CHUCKUNG)

29:32.813 --> 29:34.098
Hello, did you hear me?
Yes.

29:34.190 --> 29:35.646
And so what?

29:35.733 --> 29:38.145
So you just killed
the one shot I had
at finding my old man.

29:38.235 --> 29:42.023
He was going to shoot you
in the head. I mean,
I could have just let him.

29:42.114 --> 29:46.278
And I let you live,
which is kind of
a big deal for me.

29:47.370 --> 29:49.076
I could tell you
more about your father.

29:49.163 --> 29:51.028
Yeah.
So could a milk carton.
I'm not that interested.

29:51.123 --> 29:54.160
Look, I can't stay here,
with her, with this.

29:54.251 --> 29:56.537
I mean, you're the only one
who understands
what it's like.

29:56.629 --> 29:58.165
I know where he is.

30:04.804 --> 30:08.797
Well, you're not lying.
Which only means
you think you can find him.

30:08.891 --> 30:10.973
And I know why
you're looking for him.

30:17.483 --> 30:18.723
Tell me.

30:19.735 --> 30:21.396
Because you're
just like me.

30:22.947 --> 30:24.858
You're trying to figure out
why you are the way you are,

30:24.949 --> 30:28.112
and in this whole
hellish world your dad
might be the only answer.

30:31.163 --> 30:34.075
You take me with you,
I'll walk you
right up his driveway.

30:37.378 --> 30:39.084
Does your mother
have a car?

30:42.717 --> 30:44.378
Not anymore.

31:05.906 --> 31:08.397
What do I do if
something goes wrong?
I'll be right here.

31:08.492 --> 31:10.904
But get close to him, okay?
Use your powers.

31:11.037 --> 31:13.870
God, what if I kill him?
You're not going to.
Just disable him.

31:13.956 --> 31:16.993
We get him, we use him
as leverage against
the government.

31:17.084 --> 31:21.293
Look. He's not my brother
any more, Tracy.
And he's not your boyfriend.

31:21.380 --> 31:22.881
You understand?

31:23.632 --> 31:25.293
Yeah.
Go.

31:28.137 --> 31:30.378
Tracy.
Nathan.

31:30.473 --> 31:32.964
I came alone.
Just like you asked.

31:35.853 --> 31:38.060
Where's Peter?
I've got him.

31:39.065 --> 31:41.306
I told him that
you offered us amnesty.

31:42.443 --> 31:44.525
He'll come out
when he knows
he's safe.

31:46.113 --> 31:50.356
It's like I told you,
you deliver me Peter,
I give you your life back.

31:50.451 --> 31:53.193
You'll be surrounded by
your friends, you can play
house with the Governor,

31:53.287 --> 31:54.993
and nobody gets hurt.

31:59.627 --> 32:02.118
You must know
I'd assume
this was a trap.

32:04.256 --> 32:06.998
But I came anyway,
Tracy, for you.
The offer still stands.

32:07.093 --> 32:10.335
You deliver me Peter,
you get to go free.

32:12.640 --> 32:13.925
You're serious?

32:15.184 --> 32:17.971
Tracy, I am not
the devil
you think I am.

32:18.062 --> 32:20.895
Someone like you, I can trust.
You and l, we think alike.

32:20.981 --> 32:22.357
Peter's...

32:23.984 --> 32:25.190
He's unpredictable.

32:25.277 --> 32:26.778
He's got in his head
he's gonna save the world.

32:26.862 --> 32:31.822
And that is not how it's
gonna end. He's gonna end up
getting all of you killed.

32:33.828 --> 32:35.159
All of you.

32:41.085 --> 32:43.667
What are you saying
to her, Nathan?

32:43.754 --> 32:46.587
What, you're telling her
that I'm unstable? Crazed?

32:47.591 --> 32:51.379
You lock me up.
You fix everything.
You call off your dogs.

32:53.806 --> 32:55.922
DANKO: I got Peter.
You take the girl.

32:57.685 --> 33:00.768
You said you were alone.
I know.

33:06.235 --> 33:08.226
How many times
are we gonna do this?

33:08.362 --> 33:10.819
As many times
as it takes.
Do it. Take the shot.

33:10.906 --> 33:12.407
MR. BENNET:
I don't have it.
PETER: Back them off.

33:12.491 --> 33:13.947
NATHAN: I can't do that.
Back them off.

33:14.034 --> 33:15.319
It's over, Pete.
Give up.

33:15.411 --> 33:16.821
DANKO: Take the Shot.

33:16.912 --> 33:19.699
No, this is the beginning.
Take the damn shot.

33:25.421 --> 33:26.877
Take her.

33:29.967 --> 33:33.255
TRACY: Nathan, don't do this.
Get your hands off me! No!

33:34.305 --> 33:35.545
(TRACY GRUNTING)

33:35.639 --> 33:38.426
Nathan! Look at me.

33:39.226 --> 33:40.727
Don't do this.

33:40.853 --> 33:42.969
What the hell was that?
MR. BENNET: I told you.
I didn't have it.

33:43.063 --> 33:44.599
TRACY: No! No!

33:47.902 --> 33:49.438
I saw it.

33:50.029 --> 33:51.860
You had Peter cold.

33:51.947 --> 33:53.107
Yes, I did.

33:53.741 --> 33:54.947
Thank you.

34:13.802 --> 34:17.715
You know me.
You know I didn't
want any of this.

34:18.307 --> 34:20.423
Containment,
protecting them
from themselves,

34:20.517 --> 34:22.178
that was always my goal.

34:22.311 --> 34:23.972
Now Peter's loose,
Parkman and the others...

34:24.063 --> 34:26.645
Both sides have tasted blood.
The next move is theirs.

34:44.500 --> 34:46.866
Thank you.
I will send
money for gas.

34:53.509 --> 34:54.840
Toss your cell phones.

34:54.927 --> 34:56.588
This is the last time
we get together
using these things.

34:56.679 --> 34:58.169
If we can find
each other,
so can they.

34:58.264 --> 35:00.425
I figure we have 15 minutes.
Understood.

35:00.516 --> 35:02.302
You need to see these.
Where did you get these?

35:02.393 --> 35:03.508
MOHINDER: Matt.

35:03.936 --> 35:07.895
He drew them
right after the crash.
He has lsaac's gift.

35:08.691 --> 35:12.058
I recognize this building.
The Divya Velukkai,
New Delhi.

35:12.194 --> 35:13.434
HIRO: India?

35:15.322 --> 35:19.156
The warrior must
have his sword.
I must regain my powers.

35:19.243 --> 35:20.779
Help defeat this menace.

35:21.870 --> 35:23.906
It is my destiny
to go there.

35:24.707 --> 35:26.038
It is?

35:30.212 --> 35:32.294
Perhaps it is ours
to seek justice.

35:32.381 --> 35:33.712
I don't want it.

35:34.466 --> 35:39.301
What they're doing to us
isn'tjustice. lt'sjust
stupid. lt's blind fear.

35:39.388 --> 35:41.470
If you don't want
to see them punished,
what do you want?

35:41.557 --> 35:44.139
I want them
to pay for Daphne.

35:44.226 --> 35:46.217
Matt, that's not us.
It's not you.

35:47.229 --> 35:51.142
Let's get one thing straight.
Our lives as we knew them
are over.

35:51.233 --> 35:53.315
We can't go back
to anything
that we knew.

35:53.402 --> 35:55.358
Then what do we do?

35:55.446 --> 35:58.188
We bring the fight to them.
With everything we've got.

35:58.282 --> 36:01.524
Won't be easy. Credit cards,
bank accounts. They're gone.

36:01.618 --> 36:04.576
Homes are gonna be watched.
Can't trust the phones.

36:04.663 --> 36:07.040
We gotta find a way
to defend ourselves.

36:07.124 --> 36:10.207
We leave everything.
We do what it takes
to survive.

36:10.294 --> 36:14.879
Things we can't even imagine.
Remember, they're gonna
come for us,

36:15.591 --> 36:17.957
and when that day comes
we have to be ready.

36:48.957 --> 36:52.245
You've been awfully quiet
since you got back.

36:54.630 --> 36:56.541
I'm just tired.

36:57.966 --> 36:59.251
It was a hard trip.

36:59.343 --> 37:00.628
SANDRA: I bet.

37:01.345 --> 37:05.463
Two days of scouting colleges,
all those sorority mixers.

37:06.433 --> 37:09.266
Your dad said
you begged him
to stay another day.

37:10.771 --> 37:13.478
So? Any decisions?

37:20.155 --> 37:21.531
| just...

37:23.951 --> 37:27.489
l was thinking of
maybe staying close
to home for a while.

37:28.330 --> 37:30.036
Getting a part time job.

37:30.124 --> 37:31.580
Oh, my God.

37:32.376 --> 37:35.743
lwould love that.
I really missed you.

37:36.880 --> 37:38.996
The house would be
empty without you.

NA THAN:
Claire’s home.
She’s safe.

38:21.550 --> 38:24.667
And we both know Peter.
Sooner or later
he's gonna come to you.

38:26.054 --> 38:30.388
When he does,
can I count on you
to do the right thing?

38:33.896 --> 38:37.559
That's not why
you called, Nathan.
I can hear it in your voice.

38:38.567 --> 38:43.482
You suddenly see how this
could all end badly and you're
looking for reassurance.

38:43.572 --> 38:45.403
Maybe even absolution.

38:47.868 --> 38:49.529
But I'm not giving it.

38:50.245 --> 38:52.657
You pushed me aside
and went to the President

38:52.748 --> 38:55.831
because you thought
your team could handle this.

38:56.752 --> 38:59.414
And | suggest
you do exactly that.

sir.

39:37.793 --> 39:39.784
Tracy.
(GASPS) Nathan.

39:42.172 --> 39:45.835
God. Get me out of this.
NATHAN: Can't do that.

39:47.511 --> 39:49.627
Why?
It's too late.

39:51.640 --> 39:53.881
Why are you doing this?

39:53.976 --> 39:56.888
What I've come to realize
is that these powers
just lead to chaos.

39:56.979 --> 39:59.641
Good people, through
no fault of their own,
cannot control it.

39:59.731 --> 40:02.268
It just leads to disaster.

40:06.613 --> 40:10.652
Maybe that's what
you tell yourself so
you can sleep at night.

40:12.286 --> 40:15.323
But this is about you.
Your ambition.

40:15.872 --> 40:19.535
It's all you are, Nathan.
It's all you ever were.

40:23.213 --> 40:26.046
Try not to fight it.
It'll be easier.
