07:29.042 --> 07:31.751
Pastures?

07:33.083 --> 07:34.083
Yes!

07:35.167 --> 07:36.834
Great. Mort!

07:36.876 --> 07:38.435
- Hit the gas. - If I'm late to
- This audition,

07:38.459 --> 07:39.751
You're gonna need

07:39.752 --> 07:41.042
a real nurse.

07:41.083 --> 07:42.209
You have a terrible

07:42.210 --> 07:43.334
bedside manner.

07:43.375 --> 07:44.397
But, I diagnosed

07:44.398 --> 07:45.417
your gravy.

07:50.834 --> 07:52.042
Okay, Bertram,

07:52.083 --> 07:53.268
- this has gone on
- long enough.

07:53.292 --> 07:54.751
You dare interrupt

07:54.752 --> 07:56.209
your King!

07:56.250 --> 07:57.647
Such actions are

07:57.648 --> 07:59.042
punishable by beheading...

07:59.083 --> 08:00.125
Ooh! Come to papa!

08:03.083 --> 08:04.438
Make haste,

08:04.439 --> 08:05.792
young peasants.

08:05.834 --> 08:07.439
We haven't much time

08:07.440 --> 08:09.042
before the King returns.

08:09.083 --> 08:10.375
I'm not a peasant.

08:10.417 --> 08:11.750
My haircut probably cost

08:11.751 --> 08:13.083
more than your car.

08:13.125 --> 08:14.417
Prithee, hide!

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Come on.

08:18.083 --> 08:19.292
(EXCLAIMS)

08:19.334 --> 08:20.417
Who are you?

08:20.459 --> 08:22.417
Lord Thunderblood.

08:22.459 --> 08:24.042
No, what's your real name?

08:24.083 --> 08:26.042
Halt! It's Grover.

08:26.083 --> 08:27.272
I'm an accountant

08:27.273 --> 08:28.459
from Brooklyn.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.272
Okay, I've had enough of

08:30.273 --> 08:32.042
all these stupid

08:28.500 --> 08:32.042
made-up words like

08:32.082 --> 08:33.458
Thunderblood, Grover,

08:33.460 --> 08:34.833
and accountant.

08:36.082 --> 08:37.164
Let's just get out of here.

08:38.417 --> 08:40.000
- Resume!
- (EXCLAIMS)

08:41.250 --> 08:42.250
Okay, what is the deal

08:42.251 --> 08:43.251
with everyone yelling

08:43.292 --> 08:45.209
- "halt" and "resume"
- all the time?

08:45.250 --> 08:46.375
Halt!

08:46.417 --> 08:47.730
Aw!

08:47.731 --> 08:49.042
Ew.

08:49.083 --> 08:50.185
- If you step
- out of character,

08:50.209 --> 08:52.042
- It's a rule
- to call "halt"

08:52.083 --> 08:53.209
And then "resume"

08:53.210 --> 08:54.334
if you step back

08:52.083 --> 08:54.334
into character.

08:54.375 --> 08:56.042
- But no one is even
- around right now.

08:56.083 --> 08:58.059
- What's the point of rules
- if you don't follow them

08:58.083 --> 09:00.042
- Even when
- no one is watching?

09:00.083 --> 09:01.688
(CHUCKLES)

09:01.689 --> 09:03.292
You and I are not

09:00.083 --> 09:03.292
going to get along.

09:03.334 --> 09:05.292
- I was once king - of this realm,
- Before that

09:05.334 --> 09:06.688
Oaf Stormborn

09:06.689 --> 09:08.042
usurped my power.

09:08.083 --> 09:09.480
But together,

09:09.481 --> 09:10.876
the three of us can

09:08.083 --> 09:10.876
overthrow the King

09:10.918 --> 09:12.584
and take back the realm!

09:12.626 --> 09:13.834
Uh, meanwhile,

09:13.835 --> 09:15.042
I was in those stocks

09:12.626 --> 09:15.042
a long time.

09:15.083 --> 09:16.542
- Where's the little
- squires' room?

09:16.584 --> 09:18.292
Oh, you're kneeling in it.

09:18.334 --> 09:19.334
(RETCHES)

09:21.083 --> 09:22.167
You are correct!

09:22.168 --> 09:23.250
ALL: Yes!

The pony that vomits

09:25.669 --> 09:28.042
rainbows when she's sick

09:23.292 --> 09:28.042
is Pretty Patty!

09:28.083 --> 09:30.272
My favorite episode is

09:30.273 --> 09:32.459
the one where Pretty Patty

09:28.083 --> 09:32.459
gets food poisoning!

09:32.500 --> 09:34.042
So many colors!

09:36.167 --> 09:38.042
- Are you guys okay?
- Uh-huh.

09:38.083 --> 09:40.042
I just got rear-ended!

09:40.083 --> 09:42.042
- I gotta make sure
- Eleanor's okay!

09:42.083 --> 09:43.272
You've got someone

09:43.273 --> 09:44.459
in the trunk?

09:44.500 --> 09:45.772
Is that where you

09:45.773 --> 09:47.042
go if you lose?

09:47.083 --> 09:48.376
No! Eleanor is the

09:48.377 --> 09:49.667
name of my cab!

09:49.709 --> 09:51.167
She's my BFF.

09:52.083 --> 09:53.209
No, no, no!

09:53.250 --> 09:54.647
I can't be late

09:54.648 --> 09:56.042
to my audition!

09:56.083 --> 09:57.626
- Guys, let's take
- another cab.

09:57.667 --> 09:58.834
I think Mort and Eleanor

09:58.835 --> 10:00.000
need some alone time.

10:00.667 --> 10:03.083
No! I cannot leave!

10:03.125 --> 10:04.584
Everyone at school

10:04.585 --> 10:06.042
is watching!

10:06.083 --> 10:07.563
The baseball team is

10:07.564 --> 10:09.042
telling me to knock it

10:06.083 --> 10:09.042
out of the park.

10:09.083 --> 10:11.059
- I am not sure - what I am knocking,
- Or which park,

10:11.083 --> 10:12.147
But I am pretty sure

10:12.148 --> 10:13.209
it is a good thing.

10:16.334 --> 10:18.042
Whoa!

10:18.083 --> 10:19.730
What happened?

10:19.731 --> 10:21.375
Did Eleanor catch

10:18.083 --> 10:21.375
you taking the bus?

10:21.417 --> 10:23.230
No, I complained about

10:23.231 --> 10:25.042
the dent the guy

10:21.417 --> 10:25.042
put in my bumper,

10:25.083 --> 10:26.313
and he put a dent

10:26.314 --> 10:27.542
in my face!

10:27.584 --> 10:29.125
That is terrible!

10:29.167 --> 10:30.167
I would pummel

10:30.168 --> 10:31.168
the pudding out of him,

10:31.209 --> 10:32.938
if not for the rules

10:32.939 --> 10:34.667

10:31.209 --> 10:34.667
I cannot get out of the cab.

10:34.709 --> 10:35.876
Oh, I suppose

10:35.877 --> 10:37.042
I could suspend the rule

- No, no, no! - Rules are rules!

Once we cross the

Where's the

- You see those monkey - bars over
there that - The kids are playing on,

10:50.500 --> 10:51.959
Yeah, that's it.

10:54.083 --> 10:56.042
Resume!

10:56.083 --> 10:57.167
Once crossed,

10:57.168 --> 10:58.250
the three of us can

10:56.083 --> 10:58.250
overthrow the King!

Wait, it's just

10:59.669 --> 11:01.042
the three of us?

11:01.083 --> 11:03.059
- How can we - overthrow Bertram with
- Just three people?

11:03.083 --> 11:04.292
Easy! The King's guards

11:04.293 --> 11:05.500
lack strength,

11:05.542 --> 11:06.772
bravery, and hand-eye

11:06.773 --> 11:08.000
coordination.

11:10.292 --> 11:12.042
- Then why did
- he pick them?

11:12.083 --> 11:13.643
- They were the cream
- of the crop, they were.

11:13.667 --> 11:15.042
- We're not an
- impressive lot.

11:15.083 --> 11:16.355
Most of us really

11:16.356 --> 11:17.626
only go outdoors

11:15.083 --> 11:17.626
for the faire.

11:20.083 --> 11:22.334
Your weapon, sire.

11:22.375 --> 11:24.209

11:24.210 --> 11:26.042
to win a battle with

11:22.375 --> 11:26.042
a pool noodle?

11:26.083 --> 11:27.584
- We have to use
- fake weapons.

11:27.626 --> 11:29.126
Our mums won't let us

11:29.127 --> 11:30.626
use real ones.

11:30.667 --> 11:32.189
Now, King Stormborn's

11:32.190 --> 11:33.709
bodyguards will be

11:30.667 --> 11:33.709
surrounding him,

11:33.751 --> 11:35.730
so first we must

11:35.731 --> 11:37.709
disarm them with magic.

11:37.751 --> 11:39.647
You must cast out the spells,

11:39.648 --> 11:41.542
and throw these bean

11:37.751 --> 11:41.542
bags at the guards.

11:41.584 --> 11:42.584
Okay.

11:44.584 --> 11:45.876
What spell was that?

11:45.918 --> 11:47.189
No spell.

something at you.

broke my glasses,

12:02.083 --> 12:03.083
and I can't see

12:03.084 --> 12:04.084
a thing without them.

Since I can't drive,
