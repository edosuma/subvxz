<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

00:04.305 --> 00:05.739
We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.

00:07.627 --> 00:09.961
<i>When you're burned,</i>
<i>you've got nothing --</i>

00:10.029 --> 00:12.230
<i>no cash, no credit,</i>
<i>no job history.</i>

00:12.298 --> 00:14.633
<i>You're stuck in whatever city</i>
<i>they decide to dump you in.</i>

00:14.701 --> 00:16.501
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:16.569 --> 00:19.304
<i>You do whatever work</i>
<i>comes your way.</i>

00:19.372 --> 00:21.406
<i>You rely on anyone</i>
<i>who's still talking to you.</i>

00:22.508 --> 00:23.875
<i>A trigger-happy girlfriend...</i>

00:23.943 --> 00:25.510
Should we shoot them?

00:25.578 --> 00:27.312
<i>...an old friend who used</i>
<i>to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

00:27.380 --> 00:30.082
You know spies --
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:30.149 --> 00:32.451
<i>...family, too...</i>
<i>Hey, is that your mom again?</i>

00:32.518 --> 00:34.386
<i>...if you're desperate....</i>
<i>Someone needs your help, Michael.</i>

00:34.454 --> 00:37.522
<i>...and a down-and-out spy</i>
<i>you met along the way.</i>

00:37.590 --> 00:39.157
That's how we do it,
people.

00:39.225 --> 00:41.827
<i>Bottom line --</i>
<i>as long as you're burned,</i>

00:41.894 --> 00:47.099
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

00:49.736 --> 00:51.303
Nate!

00:51.370 --> 00:52.771
I'm sorry.

00:52.839 --> 00:55.240
No!
Nate!

00:55.308 --> 00:56.508
Nate's gone.

00:56.576 --> 00:57.776
No, he isn't!

Whatever leads the FBI
had on Nate's murder

01:08.621 --> 01:10.922
are now
in a sealed case file.

01:10.990 --> 01:12.124
Well,
we don't have the shooter,

01:12.191 --> 01:12.991
but we do have
the sniper rifle --

01:13.059 --> 01:14.893
the sale order shows

01:14.961 --> 01:16.027
the gun landed
at the Pryon Group.

01:16.095 --> 01:18.396
It's a private security firm
upstate.

01:18.464 --> 01:19.564
We have to
get a meeting

01:19.632 --> 01:21.233
with the guy
who runs the Pryon Group.

01:21.300 --> 01:24.002
He asked for a sniper
cleared on five different guns.

01:24.070 --> 01:25.370
Did you think
I wouldn't figure out

01:25.438 --> 01:26.471
you're looking for Tyler Gray?

01:26.539 --> 01:28.373
Tyler Gray?

01:34.113 --> 01:35.781
Who's Tyler Gray?

01:35.848 --> 01:37.149
Who's Tyler Gray?!

01:43.923 --> 01:47.359
<i>Whenever you get a fresh piece</i>
<i>of intelligence in the field,</i>

01:47.426 --> 01:49.161
<i>you have to decide carefully</i>

01:49.228 --> 01:50.729
<i>who you're going to</i>
<i>share it with,</i>

01:50.797 --> 01:54.099
<i>because every asset you</i>
<i>talk to, agency you work with,</i>

01:54.167 --> 01:57.636
<i>and resource you update brings</i>
<i>along a new set of problems.</i>

01:58.905 --> 02:01.973
Michael, what the hell
were you thinking

02:02.041 --> 02:03.441
bringing the CIA
into this?

02:03.509 --> 02:04.743
Fi,
I guess Sam told you.

02:04.811 --> 02:06.444
Yeah, well, I guess
he's not as comfortable

02:06.512 --> 02:08.413
lying to me
as some people are.

02:10.935 --> 02:13.203
This is a huge mistake,
Michael.

02:13.271 --> 02:14.471
A huge mistake.

02:14.539 --> 02:16.640
I didn't have a choice here.
I had to.

02:16.708 --> 02:19.376
We hit a wall,
and I needed the resources.

02:19.444 --> 02:20.844
You know as well as I do

02:20.912 --> 02:22.813
their resources
come with strings.

02:22.880 --> 02:24.247
And every time
we involve them,

02:24.315 --> 02:25.749
everything
gets more complicated!

02:25.817 --> 02:28.051
Fi, you suggested
I call the CIA.

02:28.119 --> 02:29.219
Well,
that was before

02:29.287 --> 02:30.187
they ruined
Agent Pearce's career.

02:30.254 --> 02:30.793
I'm sorry, Fi,

02:30.794 --> 02:32.895
but I'm not gonna let the man
who killed my brother get away.

02:32.962 --> 02:34.763
I don't care
who I have to work with.

02:36.599 --> 02:38.199
How do you know
they can even help?

02:38.267 --> 02:39.434
What makes you think

02:39.502 --> 02:41.536
they can find anything more
than we have?

02:41.604 --> 02:43.238
Because they already did.
Card just called me.

02:43.305 --> 02:44.105
I'm meeting him
in an hour.

02:55.584 --> 02:57.519
You, get me a dedicated
comm-link up and going.

02:57.586 --> 03:00.588
You, get me an upgraded grid
of all local law enforcement

03:00.656 --> 03:02.223
in the area.

03:02.291 --> 03:04.325
And, you, get with D.O.D. and
see if we have eyes in the sky.

03:04.393 --> 03:08.563
And, you, come with me.
What do you have?

03:08.631 --> 03:09.697
I took
your Tyler Gray file,

03:09.765 --> 03:11.299
gave it to
one of my tech geeks,

03:11.367 --> 03:13.468
and they fed the specs into
the FBI/CIA Interpol database.

03:13.536 --> 03:18.173
Nearly 1,000 partial matches
came back --

03:18.240 --> 03:21.543
photos of people who shared even
the tiniest detail with Gray.

03:21.610 --> 03:23.878
1,000? That's a big pond
to be fishing in.

03:23.946 --> 03:26.314
I tasked some low-level
gremlins at the NSA

03:26.382 --> 03:28.450
to use one of
their supercomputers

03:28.517 --> 03:32.587
to scour every shred of video
on the global system.

03:32.655 --> 03:34.222
In just under
27 hours.

03:34.290 --> 03:35.390
Pay dirt.

03:38.327 --> 03:42.197
This is a munitions warehouse
in San Miguelito, Panama.

03:42.264 --> 03:44.899
At 2:59 a.m.,
this gentleman breaks in,

03:44.967 --> 03:46.601
steals several weapons,

03:46.669 --> 03:49.070
including a Barrett
sniper rifle,

03:49.138 --> 03:52.040
a known favorite of --
Tyler Gray.

03:52.108 --> 03:54.142
Same guy flies out of Newark
using a different name

03:54.210 --> 03:57.479
three hours after your brother,
Nate, was murdered.

03:57.546 --> 03:58.980
Now for
the glamour shot.

04:04.687 --> 04:05.987
Would you please say hello

04:06.055 --> 04:08.490
to the man who murdered
your brother Nate?

04:22.052 --> 04:24.129
What do you mean,
I don't get a tactical team?

04:24.130 --> 04:25.764
Tom, the man
killed my brother.

04:25.831 --> 04:28.567
This can't come as a
galloping shock to you, Michael.

04:28.634 --> 04:30.869
The CIA was pulled
off this investigation.

04:30.937 --> 04:32.504
What about all those people
in the bullpen?

04:32.572 --> 04:34.539
Are you telling me
they're not Agency resources?

04:34.607 --> 04:37.776
Do you not understand
that in this office,

04:37.843 --> 04:39.711
I can tell any story
that I want.

04:39.779 --> 04:41.513
And as far as they know,

04:41.581 --> 04:44.516
we're investigating
a weapons theft.

04:44.584 --> 04:46.151
That is,
unless, of course,

04:46.218 --> 04:48.320
one were to actually
go down to Panama.

04:48.387 --> 04:50.455
Then you'd get the truth
pretty damn quick.

04:50.523 --> 04:51.856
What does that mean?

04:51.924 --> 04:53.992
It means that the only people
that I can send down there

04:54.060 --> 04:56.194
are already read in --
you, Jesse Porter,

04:56.262 --> 04:58.396
Fiona Glenanne,
and the Mr. Chin,

04:58.464 --> 04:59.764
whatever his name is.

04:59.832 --> 05:00.932
Is that all
you can give me?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.167
I did get you
one more person.

05:02.234 --> 05:03.301
Who?

05:03.369 --> 05:04.469
Brady Pressman.

05:04.537 --> 05:06.671
He gets the invite,
as you'll see,

05:06.739 --> 05:10.208
because he was in charge of
the capture team out of Langley

05:10.276 --> 05:11.409
that was hunting Anson.

05:11.477 --> 05:13.311
He took the failure
very personally

05:13.379 --> 05:14.813
and, as a result,
is quite motivated.

05:14.880 --> 05:16.815
I don't need to bring along
some desk jockey from Langley.

05:16.882 --> 05:19.150
Sorry, kid.
You don't get a choice.

05:19.218 --> 05:20.785
He'll be down there
to meet you when you get there

05:20.853 --> 05:22.787
with all the toys
that I can send.

05:22.855 --> 05:25.323
One more thing, Michael,
and it's important.

05:25.391 --> 05:27.192
I'm way out on the skinny
branches on this one.

05:27.259 --> 05:30.528
So whatever happens
in Panama...

05:30.596 --> 05:32.163
stays in Panama.

05:34.133 --> 05:36.234
Sam, I'll meet you guys
at the airport.

05:36.302 --> 05:38.670
I have to
go do something.

05:42.274 --> 05:43.642
Mom,
the door was locked.

05:48.648 --> 05:53.985
Well, we haven't really talked
since the funeral.

05:54.053 --> 05:55.220
But I've called.

05:55.287 --> 05:57.622
Things are happening,

05:57.690 --> 06:00.358
things that you need
to know about.

06:00.426 --> 06:02.093
And we have to talk.

06:02.161 --> 06:03.628
So? Talk.

06:03.696 --> 06:05.697
I'm heading down
to Panama.

06:07.900 --> 06:09.300
Why?

06:09.368 --> 06:12.604
Officially, I'm investigating
a weapons theft.

06:12.672 --> 06:16.441
Unofficially,
we found him.

06:16.509 --> 06:18.109
The man that...

06:20.980 --> 06:22.747
And if something
happens to you?

06:22.815 --> 06:25.817
The agency is allowing me
to bring Jesse, Fi, and Sam.

06:25.885 --> 06:28.219
That means
nothing bad's gonna happen?

06:28.287 --> 06:31.022
Well, I can call you.
I-I'll check in --

06:31.090 --> 06:33.091
it's not good enough,
Michael.

06:33.159 --> 06:35.193
Nowhere near.

06:35.261 --> 06:38.129
Who do I call
when your call doesn't come?

06:38.197 --> 06:39.564
You tell me that.

06:39.632 --> 06:42.434
I'm gonna give you the number
of Tom Card's secretary

06:42.501 --> 06:43.868
at the CIA.

06:52.411 --> 06:57.549
Tell me, uh, Michael...
Why are you here, really?

07:00.453 --> 07:03.054
I mean, since when
do you stop by

07:03.122 --> 07:05.590
and fill me in
on CIA secrets?

07:05.658 --> 07:09.994
I was thinking
that this in...

07:10.062 --> 07:14.099
in a small way...

07:14.166 --> 07:19.504
just begin to start making up
for what happened to Nate.

07:19.572 --> 07:22.507
Make up for it?

07:22.575 --> 07:25.643
I don't -- I don't know
what else to do here.

07:25.711 --> 07:27.212
I-I know you blame me.

07:27.279 --> 07:28.613
Not just you.

07:28.681 --> 07:30.715
There's more than enough blame
to go around.

07:30.783 --> 07:32.417
This is on everyone.

07:32.485 --> 07:34.185
Mom, I'm sorry.

07:34.253 --> 07:36.588
I don't want your apology!

07:41.026 --> 07:42.927
Every mistake
Nate ever made

07:42.995 --> 07:44.996
was 'cause
he wanted to be like you.

07:45.064 --> 07:46.865
He had no business
being out there!

07:46.932 --> 07:47.999
None!

07:48.067 --> 07:51.402
But Nate...

07:53.172 --> 07:56.508
I shouldn't have put him
in harm's way.

07:56.575 --> 07:59.744
But you did.

07:59.812 --> 08:02.347
And I did nothing
to stop you.

08:02.414 --> 08:04.816
And I can't
take that back.

08:04.884 --> 08:06.651
He only
wanted to help you

08:06.719 --> 08:09.287
because he knew
how proud of you <i>I</i> was.

08:09.355 --> 08:12.190
I was his mother.

08:12.258 --> 08:15.026
And my job was
to protect him from you!

08:17.363 --> 08:19.497
And I didn't do it.

08:21.333 --> 08:24.669
No, please, just...
Please, no.

09:05.711 --> 09:08.746
So, this is it, huh?

09:08.814 --> 09:11.382
Casa sweet casa?
I wouldn't say that.

09:11.450 --> 09:14.018
It's not exactly one
of your sugar mama's five-stars.

09:14.086 --> 09:16.120
Yeah, well,
this isn't exactly a vacation.

09:16.188 --> 09:18.456
Michael Westen,
Brady Pressman.

09:18.524 --> 09:20.358
Sam Axe.
Yes, sir.

09:20.426 --> 09:22.460
Jesse Porter.
How you doing?

09:22.528 --> 09:24.696
And you must be Fiona Glenanne.
Nice to meet you.

09:24.763 --> 09:26.798
So, you're the one the CIA
has running this Op?

09:29.735 --> 09:32.470
On paper, yeah, but we're all
in this together, right?

09:32.538 --> 09:33.938
I guess so.

09:37.276 --> 09:38.309
Did I say something?

09:38.377 --> 09:39.777
She's just jet-lagged.

09:41.213 --> 09:44.949
The gear's already upstairs
waiting to be set up,

09:45.017 --> 09:45.950
so let's get to it.

09:48.187 --> 09:51.322
<i>One of the most popular bases</i>
<i>for covert operations</i>

09:51.390 --> 09:54.792
<i>is an abandoned building.</i>

09:54.860 --> 09:56.728
<i>Hotels and apartments</i>
<i>have too many people</i>

09:56.795 --> 09:59.397
<i>coming and going</i>
<i>to base a long-term Op.</i>

09:59.465 --> 10:01.966
<i>You can buy a house,</i>
<i>but it's hard to buy something</i>

10:02.034 --> 10:04.402
<i>big enough discreetly</i>
<i>on short notice.</i>

10:04.470 --> 10:06.537
<i>Find a building</i>
<i>that's been condemned, however,</i>

10:06.605 --> 10:08.306
<i>and you can move right in,</i>

10:08.374 --> 10:11.075
<i>as long as you can find a way</i>
<i>to supply power</i>

10:11.143 --> 10:12.176
<i>and you don't mind</i>
<i>a little dust.</i>

10:21.587 --> 10:24.122
Okay, everybody.
Here's what we got.

10:24.189 --> 10:25.323
A guy fitting
Gray's description

10:25.391 --> 10:27.525
has been seen
throwing around a lot of cash

10:27.593 --> 10:29.427
in this area
of San Miguelito.

10:29.495 --> 10:32.430
Local assets helped track him
to this building.

10:32.498 --> 10:33.765
That's our target.

10:33.832 --> 10:35.600
The outer wall
is two feet thick.

10:35.668 --> 10:37.702
To breach,
we brought this.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.339
To get that frame
on that wall,

10:41.407 --> 10:43.074
you're gonna need
a masonry drill bit.

10:43.142 --> 10:44.375
Did you bring one?
No need.

10:44.443 --> 10:46.644
This baby's the newest
in speed frames.

10:46.712 --> 10:48.246
Sticks to anything.

10:48.314 --> 10:51.749
To cover the extraction,
we got an M110 rifle.

10:51.817 --> 10:54.052
Oh, I'll happily
take that.

10:54.119 --> 10:56.621
Oh, that's, uh, I thought
they were still testing these.

10:56.689 --> 10:59.090
They are. Official approval
comes down next month.

10:59.158 --> 11:00.892
Thought you'd appreciate
a sneak preview.

11:00.960 --> 11:04.796
Level five body armor,
one for Jesse, one for Michael.

11:04.863 --> 11:07.465
After Fiona blows the wall,
you two breach.

11:07.533 --> 11:09.133
It's gonna be hard to clear a
structure that big with a two-man team.

11:09.201 --> 11:11.169
That's why we have
these puppies.

11:11.236 --> 11:13.771
Is that a corner shot?
APR 556.

11:13.839 --> 11:15.974
Shoot around tight corners
without someone covering you.

11:16.041 --> 11:16.975
Question.

11:18.344 --> 11:19.811
I know what <i>we're</i> doing,

11:19.878 --> 11:22.113
but I'm a little unclear
as to what it is <i>you're</i> doing.

11:22.181 --> 11:24.682
I'll be in radio contact
with everyone calling the plays.

11:24.750 --> 11:26.017
So, while we're
risking our asses,

11:26.085 --> 11:28.152
you hang back
way behind the front line?

11:28.220 --> 11:30.822
Look, someone needs to --
Okay. Good night, Michael.

11:35.060 --> 11:37.161
Wow. She really
doesn't like me.

11:37.229 --> 11:38.963
It's not you, Brady.
Don't take it personally.

11:39.031 --> 11:40.264
All right.

11:40.332 --> 11:43.001
Let's go over the extraction
step by step.

11:43.068 --> 11:45.403
Start by approaching
the south wall.

11:45.471 --> 11:47.472
Fiona
will place the charges.

11:47.539 --> 11:49.574
Sam will set up
on this third-story balcony.

11:49.641 --> 11:51.175
We'll time our breach
for noon.

11:51.243 --> 11:52.844
Take him on foot
down this alley.

11:52.878 --> 11:54.278
We'll put him in the car here

11:54.346 --> 11:56.014
and take him directly
to the airport.

11:56.081 --> 11:57.315
All right, kids.

11:57.383 --> 11:59.717
Tomorrow's a long day,
so let's get to bed.

12:05.991 --> 12:09.093
Fi,
what are you doing up?

12:09.161 --> 12:12.730
I couldn't sleep.

12:12.798 --> 12:19.203
There's only one other place
I've ever seen a sky that color.

12:19.271 --> 12:21.072
Over the Irish Sea.

12:21.140 --> 12:24.108
I remember.

12:26.879 --> 12:29.647
You have no idea how beautiful
you look right now.

12:35.120 --> 12:38.322
Michael,
I know I've been difficult.

12:38.390 --> 12:40.558
I don't have
anything against Brady.

12:40.626 --> 12:42.727
It's just,
this is our business.

12:42.795 --> 12:46.531
Nate was...
He was our family, too.

12:46.598 --> 12:49.300
We should be doing this alone,
without government manipulation.

12:49.368 --> 12:50.968
We owe that much
to Nate.

12:51.036 --> 12:54.205
I didn't want Brady here,
either, but he's doing his job,

12:54.273 --> 12:56.307
and we owe it to Nate
to find his killer.

12:56.375 --> 12:57.375
Period.

12:57.443 --> 12:58.976
Okay.

13:02.347 --> 13:04.282
Uh, Fi?

13:06.251 --> 13:09.687
An electrician
at 6:00 a.m.

13:09.755 --> 13:11.823
Not just that,
it's an electrical truck

13:11.890 --> 13:13.925
parked outside a building
without any power.

13:14.827 --> 13:15.827
We have a problem.

13:15.894 --> 13:17.462
Everybody up!

13:17.529 --> 13:19.297
Everybody up now!
Jesse, Sam!

13:19.364 --> 13:21.299
What? What time is it?
Time's up. We've been made.

13:21.366 --> 13:22.900
What are you talking about?

13:22.968 --> 13:24.802
Look outside.

13:24.870 --> 13:26.437
It's just
an electrical truck.

13:26.505 --> 13:27.572
Courtyard's empty.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.042
Red dots
on the ground.

13:33.245 --> 13:35.746
Laser sights.

13:40.519 --> 13:42.053
Oh, crap. I hate it
when you're right, Mike.

13:42.121 --> 13:43.321
Okay,
we need an exit,

13:43.388 --> 13:44.755
or we're gonna be hosting
one hell of a fiesta.

13:44.823 --> 13:46.357
Back door is covered.

13:46.425 --> 13:48.392
The stairs aren't an option.
We're trapped.

13:48.460 --> 13:49.827
How long
before they breach?

13:49.895 --> 13:51.329
For a standard breach,
a minute.

13:51.396 --> 13:53.464
They want to breach?
Let's breach.

13:53.532 --> 13:55.099
We're going
through the roof.

14:06.078 --> 14:07.311
Take cover.

14:12.151 --> 14:14.418
Go! We're in!

14:30.169 --> 14:33.104
No go on this side.
They're covering the alley.

14:33.172 --> 14:35.006
Just a heads up --
I'm not wearing any shoes.

14:35.073 --> 14:36.841
This is gonna suck.

14:36.909 --> 14:38.743
Okay, well, look,
if down ain't an option,

14:38.810 --> 14:39.994
somebody better
grow some wings quick.

14:39.995 --> 14:41.088
The next building.

14:41.113 --> 14:42.980
If we can get over to it,
there's a parking garage.

14:42.981 --> 14:44.949
We can steal a car
and drive off.

14:45.017 --> 14:47.318
Oh, Mike, I don't know.
Long jump was never my event.

14:47.386 --> 14:49.353
I think I can help you
with that.

14:50.596 --> 14:51.787
<i>With a running start,</i>

14:51.788 --> 14:54.990
<i>the average adult can jump</i>
<i>a distance of about 10 feet.</i>

14:55.492 --> 14:57.259
<i>The trick</i>
<i>to clearing bigger gaps</i>

14:57.327 --> 14:58.928
<i>is raising your launch point</i>

14:58.996 --> 15:01.263
<i>and making your jump</i>
<i>at full speed.</i>

15:01.331 --> 15:03.833
<i>It's all about</i>
<i>maximizing your momentum,</i>

15:03.900 --> 15:05.835
<i>which can make the difference</i>
<i>between a safe landing...</i>

15:07.404 --> 15:09.472
<i>...and a date</i>
<i>with the pavement.</i>

15:09.539 --> 15:11.374
Try and roll
when you land.

15:11.441 --> 15:13.075
Fi, you're next.

15:18.649 --> 15:20.283
Go! Go, go!
Everyone, go!

15:48.579 --> 15:50.046
It's him! It's Gray!

15:50.113 --> 15:51.881
Michael! No!
Come on!

15:51.949 --> 15:53.316
Michael!

15:53.383 --> 15:55.084
Mike, they're coming through
that door any second!

15:55.152 --> 15:56.352
We got to
get out of here now!

16:05.440 --> 16:06.849
Well, we swept the junkyard.

16:06.850 --> 16:08.918
There's no one here.
How was it out there, Mike?

16:08.985 --> 16:10.252
Perimeter's clear.

16:10.320 --> 16:12.888
Yeah, but for how long?
Gray knows we're in Panama.

16:12.956 --> 16:14.723
He's not gonna stop
until he finds us.

16:14.791 --> 16:16.559
Which means
we got to find him first.

16:16.626 --> 16:18.093
I'm sorry.
I must have misheard.

16:18.161 --> 16:19.695
You want to go find him?

16:19.763 --> 16:22.231
I may not have a ton
of field experience,

16:22.299 --> 16:24.366
but we're outgunned
in a foreign country, Michael.

16:24.434 --> 16:25.634
We need
to call in backup.

16:25.702 --> 16:27.303
There's no time
to wait for backup.

16:27.370 --> 16:29.438
Gray's merc forces
could find us at anytime.

16:29.506 --> 16:30.806
We have to
hit them now.

16:30.874 --> 16:32.441
What did we manage
to bring?

16:32.509 --> 16:34.810
One shotgun...

16:36.346 --> 16:39.815
...about 80 rounds
for the M110 rifle.

16:39.883 --> 16:42.084
No M110 rifle.

16:42.152 --> 16:44.787
Sig sauer, two rounds.

16:44.855 --> 16:47.256
Beretta, nine rounds.

16:47.324 --> 16:50.326
30 feet of tactical rope,
two zip ties,

16:50.393 --> 16:51.994
and this chunk
of styrofoam.

16:52.062 --> 16:55.965
And in case anyone forgot,
not wearing any shoes.

16:56.032 --> 16:57.833
Completely shoeless
in Panama.

16:57.901 --> 16:59.401
Okay, hang on.
Look at this.

16:59.469 --> 17:01.871
This scope was in my pocket
the whole time.

17:01.938 --> 17:04.772
Right, you also have the scope
to the M110 rifle

17:04.840 --> 17:06.407
we still don't have.

17:06.476 --> 17:08.377
We're not equipped
to go after Gray.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.311
Look, it's just a matter of time
before our next encounter

17:10.380 --> 17:11.512
with Gray and his army.

17:11.580 --> 17:12.647
Wouldn't you rather it be
on our terms?

17:12.715 --> 17:13.949
Absolutely.

17:14.017 --> 17:15.351
That's why we got to
find the wasps' nest.

17:15.417 --> 17:16.852
Now, Brady,
you know San Miguelito.

17:16.920 --> 17:18.988
Jesse and I can help you
track down their HQ,

17:19.055 --> 17:20.356
and we'll
scout an attack.

17:20.423 --> 17:22.124
These guys travel
in armored S.U.V.s.

17:22.192 --> 17:24.059
Exactly what are we gonna be
attacking with?

17:24.127 --> 17:26.295
We need to make use
of those M110 rounds.

17:26.363 --> 17:28.631
I think we can put something
together that'll go boom.

17:28.698 --> 17:29.832
You must be kidding.

17:29.900 --> 17:33.802
When it comes to explosives,
I never kid.

17:33.870 --> 17:36.572
<i>If you're building ammunition</i>
<i>to shatter reinforced glass,</i>

17:36.640 --> 17:39.475
<i>you need something harder</i>
<i>than buckshot.</i>

17:39.542 --> 17:41.744
<i>If you don't have a handful</i>
<i>of diamonds lying around,</i>

17:41.811 --> 17:43.212
<i>spark plugs will do.</i>

17:43.280 --> 17:45.881
<i>Their ceramic casings</i>
<i>are nearly as hard.</i>

17:47.250 --> 17:48.550
<i>Once you've dealt</i>
<i>with the glass,</i>

17:48.618 --> 17:50.252
<i>you have to deal</i>
<i>with the people behind it.</i>

17:50.320 --> 17:52.054
<i>A serviceable</i>
<i>flash-bang grenade</i>

17:52.122 --> 17:54.156
<i>can be made from a soda can</i>

17:54.224 --> 17:56.625
<i>filled with aluminum shavings</i>
<i>and gunpowder.</i>

17:56.693 --> 17:58.627
<i>Not as stable</i>
<i>as military issue,</i>

17:58.695 --> 18:01.864
<i>but it still packs</i>
<i>one hell of a kick.</i>

18:09.039 --> 18:12.308
Fi, when you were
talking about Ireland earlier,

18:12.375 --> 18:14.276
I hope you know
I miss that time, too.

18:19.263 --> 18:22.866
Michael,
I don't need Ireland.

18:24.869 --> 18:25.835
I want this.

18:25.903 --> 18:29.873
A junkyard in Panama?

18:31.776 --> 18:33.510
You and me
working together.

18:33.577 --> 18:37.847
Just us,
the way it used to be.

18:40.317 --> 18:43.219
At the end of the day,
this...

18:43.287 --> 18:46.489
this right here
is how it should be.

18:51.595 --> 18:55.532
After I get Gray,
I'll leave. I'm out.

18:57.401 --> 18:58.835
The CIA?

18:58.903 --> 19:00.870
Out of all of it.

19:00.938 --> 19:02.806
Don't say that
if you don't mean it.

19:02.873 --> 19:04.874
I do.

19:06.444 --> 19:08.478
How does that sound?

19:08.546 --> 19:12.248
Well, if we live long enough
to see that happen,

19:12.316 --> 19:14.017
it sounds really good.

19:24.695 --> 19:26.996
<i>When you give a piece</i>
<i>of intelligence to anyone,</i>

19:27.064 --> 19:28.531
<i>even an ally,</i>

19:28.599 --> 19:30.967
<i>you never know what</i>
<i>they're going to do with it.</i>

19:31.035 --> 19:33.203
<i>Because even if you</i>
<i>completely trust that person,</i>

19:33.270 --> 19:35.472
<i>you run the risk</i>
<i>of them taking that information</i>

19:35.539 --> 19:37.907
<i>and using it</i>
<i>for their own purposes.</i>

19:40.978 --> 19:42.812
Ma'am, are you sure you don't
want to sit while you wait?

19:42.880 --> 19:44.614
No, I'm fine.

19:44.682 --> 19:47.350
How much longer
will your boss be?

19:50.354 --> 19:52.722
Mrs. Westen,
nice of you to come by.

19:52.790 --> 19:53.757
What can I do for you?

19:53.824 --> 19:55.759
I'm here about my son.

19:55.826 --> 19:56.993
Well, he's in the field
right now.

19:57.061 --> 19:59.929
My other son.

19:59.997 --> 20:02.332
Ah.

20:02.399 --> 20:04.534
Well, on behalf
of the entire agency,

20:04.602 --> 20:06.069
we're very sorry
for your loss.

20:06.137 --> 20:08.204
I'm not here
for your sympathy.

20:08.272 --> 20:09.639
What are you here for?

20:11.375 --> 20:13.042
Answers.

20:13.110 --> 20:16.246
I want to know everything
that you know

20:16.313 --> 20:19.249
about the operation
that killed Nate.

20:19.316 --> 20:24.654
Mrs. Westen, that's what we call
classified information.

20:24.722 --> 20:28.792
It's an operation
that one of my boys died in

20:28.859 --> 20:30.894
and the other one ran.

20:30.961 --> 20:32.595
I realize that.

20:32.663 --> 20:34.898
And I wish I could help you,
but I can't.

20:34.965 --> 20:36.266
Yes, you can.

20:36.333 --> 20:38.635
And you will,

20:38.702 --> 20:41.037
or I'm going to cause a scene
right here, right now.

20:41.105 --> 20:43.439
I know
that you sent Michael

20:43.507 --> 20:46.442
on an off-the-books mission
to Panama.

20:47.446 --> 20:49.814
I know
what he's there for.

20:49.882 --> 20:52.517
Unless
you want that mission

20:52.585 --> 20:55.676
to be suddenly
very much on the books,

20:55.678 --> 20:57.812
I suggest
you cooperate.

21:00.439 --> 21:02.073
You're blackmailing
a CIA officer

21:02.141 --> 21:04.609
without
batting an eyelash.

21:04.677 --> 21:06.377
And here I thought Michael
got all his moxie

21:06.445 --> 21:07.312
from his papa bear.

21:08.981 --> 21:10.114
Come.

21:15.621 --> 21:18.523
Just to be clear,
I'm not supposed to

21:18.591 --> 21:21.259
share mission specifics
with civilians.

21:22.494 --> 21:24.429
I'm giving this to you
because I trust Michael,

21:24.496 --> 21:27.632
and I believe
I can trust you, too.

21:27.700 --> 21:30.969
I can keep a secret,
believe me.

21:47.653 --> 21:50.521
<i>Locating a group of mercenaries</i>
<i>in a third-world country</i>

21:50.589 --> 21:51.923
<i>isn't terribly difficult</i>

21:51.991 --> 21:54.225
<i>because they're very similar</i>
<i>to street thugs.</i>

21:54.293 --> 21:55.827
<i>They flaunt their presence.</i>

21:55.894 --> 21:57.395
<i>So if you want to</i>
<i>find an outfit,</i>

21:57.463 --> 21:59.564
<i>it's as simple</i>
<i>as asking around.</i>

21:59.632 --> 22:01.899
<i>The question</i>
<i>isn't where they are.</i>

22:01.967 --> 22:03.701
<i>It's what you're gonna do</i>
<i>when you find them.</i>

22:03.769 --> 22:04.969
You don't realize

22:05.037 --> 22:06.904
how much broken glass there is
on the street

22:06.972 --> 22:08.439
until you're not
wearing any shoes.

22:08.507 --> 22:09.474
Look at that.

22:09.541 --> 22:11.643
That was in my foot.

22:11.710 --> 22:13.578
So, I asked around,
and word is,

22:13.646 --> 22:15.313
these are the guys
that attacked us.

22:15.381 --> 22:18.583
They're ex-military guns
for hire called Los Hermanos.

22:18.651 --> 22:20.918
Really?
That's the best name they got?

22:20.986 --> 22:24.989
They hire themselves out
to smugglers, drug gangs,

22:25.057 --> 22:26.224
murderers on the run.

22:26.291 --> 22:27.392
I'm not looking forward

22:27.459 --> 22:28.993
to a run-in
with all that firepower.

22:29.061 --> 22:30.328
Sam, let me see that scope
real quick.

22:36.035 --> 22:37.568
What the hell
are you doing?

22:37.636 --> 22:39.671
What? Without a battery,
the digital display is useless.

22:39.738 --> 22:40.972
It's $50,000.

22:41.040 --> 22:42.607
Yeah, and now
we can actually use it.

22:42.675 --> 22:43.675
You're welcome.

22:46.779 --> 22:49.547
Oh, wow.
That does not look good.

22:49.615 --> 22:51.015
That looks like
one of the worst places

22:51.083 --> 22:52.850
to stage a snatch-and-grab
in the Western hemisphere.

22:52.918 --> 22:55.420
All right. Okay.
So we don't do it there.

22:55.487 --> 22:57.121
We do it right there.

23:01.126 --> 23:03.233
What about that
angry-looking guy down there?

23:03.234 --> 23:05.006
Yeah he's angry looking,
but he's only one guy.

23:05.008 --> 23:07.215
Jesse's right. I mean, that street's
our best bet for grabbing Gray.

23:07.315 --> 23:08.716
We got to
adios that guy.

23:08.783 --> 23:10.284
We don't have
a 20 on Gray.

23:10.352 --> 23:11.952
He might be on his way
back here right now.

23:12.020 --> 23:13.454
Exactly.

23:13.521 --> 23:15.356
That's why we got to adios
señor angry muy, muy pronto.

23:15.423 --> 23:17.024
Anybody
got a genius idea?

23:17.092 --> 23:19.393
I think I do. You guys head
for that alley right behind him.

23:19.461 --> 23:21.662
I'm gonna go shopping
for a ride.

23:21.730 --> 23:23.364
Aah!

23:23.431 --> 23:25.366
Son of a bitch.

23:25.950 --> 23:27.576
<i>It's a popular misconception</i>

23:27.577 --> 23:30.045
<i>that guard duty is all about</i>
<i>watching for people.</i>

23:30.112 --> 23:31.847
<i>In fact, people are usually</i>

23:31.914 --> 23:35.317
<i>a much lower priority</i>
<i>than vehicles.</i>

23:35.384 --> 23:36.685
<i>A well-trained guard</i>

23:36.752 --> 23:38.820
<i>will focus first</i>
<i>on keeping the road clear</i>

23:38.888 --> 23:41.656
<i>and monitoring suspicious cars</i>
<i>in the vicinity,</i>

23:41.724 --> 23:44.693
<i>which can give you</i>
<i>a great excuse to get up close.</i>

23:44.760 --> 23:46.595
Hey, buddy. Can you tell me
where the gas station is?

23:48.297 --> 23:50.532
What? I don't --
I no understand-o, amigo.

23:53.870 --> 23:55.503
American.
I'm American.

23:55.571 --> 23:58.940
Uh, gas-o zero-o.

23:59.008 --> 24:02.177
Put-put-put-put, brr-brr.
No mas.

24:04.780 --> 24:07.983
Dude! Is this where we are?
Are we here?

24:08.050 --> 24:09.851
'Cause I made a left
on Castillo.

24:19.095 --> 24:19.995
Qué?

24:30.673 --> 24:32.047
Get the gun! Get the gun!

24:36.879 --> 24:41.917
Okay. That worked out
quite nicely.

24:45.087 --> 24:46.655
What size shoe
do you think he wears?

24:55.901 --> 24:58.135
Enjoy
your trash nap, pal.

24:59.915 --> 25:00.956
Good timing.

25:00.958 --> 25:03.259
We just finished cleaning up.
You find a place to hit Gray?

25:03.327 --> 25:04.927
Yeah. And more importantly,
I got a new pair of shoes.

25:05.829 --> 25:07.297
Oh.

25:07.364 --> 25:09.632
A Panamanian peep toe.
Très chic.

25:09.700 --> 25:11.301
All right, so, we got
a radio in the corner,

25:11.368 --> 25:14.570
but I still don't see how
we're gonna capture Gray.

25:14.638 --> 25:17.707
Here. These are filled
with ceramic fragments.

25:17.775 --> 25:20.043
It should get us through the
reinforced glass of the S.U.V.,

25:20.110 --> 25:21.177
but don't shake them
too much.

25:21.245 --> 25:22.378
We only had enough
to make three.

25:22.446 --> 25:24.113
Fi will give Gray
a reason to stop.

25:24.181 --> 25:26.182
If you could take out
the windows with those,

25:26.250 --> 25:28.685
I should be able to deal with
the people inside with these.

25:28.752 --> 25:31.054
Yeah, Mike, uh, how about
if I'm on flash-bang duty?

25:31.121 --> 25:32.488
You're driving
the getaway car, Sam.

25:32.556 --> 25:33.623
I've got this.

25:33.691 --> 25:35.024
I'm sure you do, brother,

25:35.092 --> 25:37.060
but it looks like you also got
a few broken ribs.

25:37.127 --> 25:38.428
Sam, listen to me.

25:38.495 --> 25:39.996
I'm hitting Gray,
I'm pulling him out of the car,

25:40.064 --> 25:41.431
and I'm shoving him
in the trunk!

25:47.004 --> 25:49.572
Gray's en route.

25:49.640 --> 25:51.407
We got about 30 minutes
to set up.

25:51.475 --> 25:52.675
Let's go catch ourselves
a killer.

26:07.124 --> 26:08.858
All right, then.

26:08.926 --> 26:13.463
Now that you've seen the file,
are you satisfied?

26:13.530 --> 26:16.499
No.

26:16.567 --> 26:21.204
I can't say that I am.
I got a question for you.

26:21.271 --> 26:24.040
Look, I'm sorry,
but I gave you the file.

26:24.108 --> 26:25.375
Do you have any idea
what I'm risking

26:25.442 --> 26:26.376
even having you
in this room?

26:26.443 --> 26:28.978
I could lose everyt--

26:29.046 --> 26:31.948
Don't talk to me
about loss.

26:32.015 --> 26:35.251
I lost my husband
and my youngest son,

26:35.319 --> 26:37.787
and all because
of this Agency.

26:37.855 --> 26:40.323
Mrs. Westen,
I can't even begin

26:40.391 --> 26:43.092
to know what
that must feel like.

26:43.160 --> 26:45.895
But please,
what do you want from me?

26:45.963 --> 26:49.132
Just decency.

26:52.035 --> 26:53.536
And an answer
to my question.

26:54.128 --> 26:57.931
You trained Michael.
You know another side of him.

27:06.006 --> 27:07.340
Please ask.

27:08.463 --> 27:12.483
It's no secret
what our home life was like,

27:12.484 --> 27:15.519
what Michael's and Nate's
childhood was like.

27:18.190 --> 27:21.625
It was my choice
not to leave Frank.

27:22.635 --> 27:27.259
And that choice made Michael
strong and capable...

27:29.801 --> 27:32.636
...while it left poor Nate just...

27:35.407 --> 27:39.076
How do two brothers
turn out so different?

27:39.144 --> 27:45.349
Imagine that you're holding on
to two bottles

27:45.417 --> 27:46.951
and they drop
on the floor.

27:47.018 --> 27:48.052
What happens?

27:48.120 --> 27:51.922
They both break.

27:51.990 --> 27:55.359
But it's <i>how</i> they break
that's important.

27:55.427 --> 27:57.027
Because, you see,

27:57.095 --> 28:01.065
while one bottle crumples
into a pile of glass,

28:01.133 --> 28:06.504
the other shatters
into a jagged-edged weapon.

28:06.571 --> 28:09.006
You see,
the exact same environment

28:09.074 --> 28:13.010
that forged older brother into
a warrior crushed baby brother.

28:13.078 --> 28:17.515
People just don't all
break the same, Mrs. Westen.

28:17.582 --> 28:18.849
Just don't.

28:18.917 --> 28:21.185
Problem here is that you're just
focused on the bad,

28:21.253 --> 28:23.587
'cause there's some good
that came through there, too.

28:23.655 --> 28:25.389
Don't get me wrong.
Michael is damaged.

28:25.457 --> 28:27.224
But he also
happens to be a little boy

28:27.292 --> 28:30.861
who just wants to protect
his mommy and his kid brother.

28:30.929 --> 28:33.697
Which means that all the people
that he ever helped

28:33.765 --> 28:37.435
actually
have to thank...you.

28:40.472 --> 28:43.174
And Nate, of course.

28:45.644 --> 28:47.478
That's all I have.

28:47.546 --> 28:50.514
I just need a minute.

28:50.582 --> 28:52.850
Please take
all the time you need.

28:52.918 --> 28:57.688
I will, uh...
I'll be in my office.

28:59.136 --> 29:00.436
<i>Setting up a snatch-and-grab</i>

29:00.504 --> 29:02.938
<i>requires having</i>
<i>the right pieces in place.</i>

29:03.006 --> 29:06.442
<i>You need a lookout up high,</i>
<i>a driver in the getaway car,</i>

29:06.510 --> 29:08.711
<i>and someone</i>
<i>to create the distraction.</i>

29:08.779 --> 29:11.714
<i>Then you just have to wait</i>
<i>for the target to show up.</i>

29:13.350 --> 29:15.251
Now, Brady,
you don't have to do this.

29:15.318 --> 29:17.787
What the hell
are you talking about?

29:17.854 --> 29:21.524
I appreciate you coming
down here, helping us find Gray,

29:21.591 --> 29:23.526
but this isn't your fight.
You're not even a field op.

29:23.593 --> 29:25.661
Nate was my brother.

29:25.729 --> 29:27.496
You don't have to
risk your life for this.

29:27.564 --> 29:29.498
No, I do.
It was my Op that went sideways.

29:29.566 --> 29:31.300
My fault we're even
on this trip.

29:31.334 --> 29:32.868
No, it's not.
It's mine. All of this.

29:39.743 --> 29:42.878
I want to
tell you a story.

29:42.946 --> 29:44.280
When I was a little kid,

29:44.347 --> 29:46.715
there was nothing I loved
more than baseball.

29:46.783 --> 29:49.785
I was watching
the Red Sox game

29:49.853 --> 29:51.620
when my mom
turned off the television.

29:51.688 --> 29:54.223
She'd just gotten a call
about my dad.

29:54.291 --> 29:56.091
Your dad was military?

29:56.159 --> 29:58.360
A Ranger. K.I.A.

29:58.428 --> 30:01.430
Had my 14th birthday
a week after his funeral.

30:01.498 --> 30:06.468
The day I turned 18
is the day I joined the Army.

30:06.536 --> 30:08.671
Wanted to find the guy
that killed him.

30:08.738 --> 30:09.772
It's crazy, right?

30:09.840 --> 30:12.474
It's not so crazy.

30:12.542 --> 30:14.009
Yeah, well,
I never got the guy.

30:14.077 --> 30:15.878
But I'll be damned
if I'm not gonna help you

30:15.946 --> 30:17.813
find the son of a bitch
who killed your brother.

30:20.250 --> 30:21.884
For what it's worth,
Brady,

30:21.952 --> 30:24.153
it's good to have you
on the team.

30:27.057 --> 30:28.924
Jesse.

30:28.992 --> 30:32.461
Okay, it's go time, Mike. I got
two S.U.V.s coming your way.

30:32.529 --> 30:34.230
Fender and a hummer.
You have a visual on Gray?

30:37.734 --> 30:38.934
Bingo. Yeah.

30:39.002 --> 30:40.102
He's in the hummer,
backseat, driver's side.

30:40.170 --> 30:41.470
Just passed Sam.

30:43.506 --> 30:45.341
Put your game face on, man.
I'll call Fi.

30:45.408 --> 30:47.509
Time to
make some noise.

30:47.577 --> 30:48.878
You ready?

30:48.945 --> 30:49.945
Hey.

30:50.914 --> 30:51.914
Thank you.

31:15.071 --> 31:16.939
Drive!

31:20.010 --> 31:21.343
He just
killed his own guy.

31:21.411 --> 31:22.878
Yeah, and blocked
our flash-bang.

31:22.946 --> 31:24.480
Get in.

31:32.055 --> 31:34.823
Mike, look. There.
There's the Hummer.

31:42.632 --> 31:45.868
Jesus, Mike,
he shot his own driver.

31:45.936 --> 31:47.336
He couldn't have
gotten far.

31:48.505 --> 31:50.239
Aah! My leg!

31:54.511 --> 31:56.745
He must be in that building,
but I can't see him.

31:56.813 --> 31:58.881
Keep your head down, Sam.
You're not gonna see him.

31:58.949 --> 32:00.716
He was waiting for us,
and we walked right into it.

32:00.784 --> 32:03.218
How bad it, Mike?

32:03.286 --> 32:04.824
We need to get him
to a hospital, Sam.

32:04.849 --> 32:05.854
Listen to me.

32:05.855 --> 32:07.122
There's no time for a hospital,
and you know it.

32:07.190 --> 32:08.757
Just tighten it up enough...

32:08.825 --> 32:10.392
...to stop the bleeding.

32:10.460 --> 32:11.827
You go in,
and you get him.

32:17.367 --> 32:19.034
Trust me, I will.

32:20.313 --> 32:22.452
Tom, I don't have time
to debate this.

32:22.523 --> 32:24.490
We have Gray
cornered now.

32:24.558 --> 32:25.791
We are going in.
Negative.

32:26.468 --> 32:27.401
You will stand down.

32:27.469 --> 32:28.669
You already have one man

32:28.737 --> 32:30.438
in need of serious
medical attention.

32:30.506 --> 32:33.641
You will wait for backup,
which is already on its way.

32:33.709 --> 32:35.843
We won't get a better shot
at him. We can't wait.

32:35.911 --> 32:38.012
So, what? Are you gonna go in
blind, deaf, and bleeding?

32:38.080 --> 32:39.714
That's a super idea,
Michael.

32:39.781 --> 32:40.982
Tom, listen to me.

32:41.049 --> 32:43.651
We already have a plan.
I'm going in.

32:43.719 --> 32:45.553
Accept my apologies
in advance.

32:45.621 --> 32:48.689
Yeah, Mike, uh, you want to
share this plan we already got?

32:48.757 --> 32:51.192
'Cause last I checked, we got
a sniper in that building,

32:51.260 --> 32:52.460
and we have no idea
where he is.

32:52.528 --> 32:53.761
We have to give him a reason
to show his face.

32:53.829 --> 32:55.296
West Side.

32:55.364 --> 32:58.099
There's only one halfway decent
sniper perch over there.

32:58.167 --> 33:00.067
Good call, Fi.

33:00.135 --> 33:02.537
If we can get you and Jesse
over to those barrels,

33:02.604 --> 33:04.605
make it look like
we're trying to flank him,

33:04.673 --> 33:06.407
he'll have to move
to get a shot at you.

33:06.475 --> 33:07.642
Which would
give us enough time

33:07.709 --> 33:08.910
to scale the east side
and drop in for a chat.

33:08.977 --> 33:10.111
I like it.

33:10.179 --> 33:11.412
Of course you do.
You're not the one

33:11.480 --> 33:12.980
trying to outrun a sniper
in hobo shoes, Sam.

33:13.048 --> 33:14.348
You gonna be okay here?
Yeah.

33:14.416 --> 33:15.983
You guys
go get that bastard.

33:17.319 --> 33:19.287
You ready?
Yeah.

33:32.028 --> 33:33.991
- What do you see?
- He's moving. He's moving.

33:37.773 --> 33:39.640
Aah!

33:40.409 --> 33:41.842
What? Are you hit?
Yeah. He knicked me.

33:41.910 --> 33:42.977
You good?

33:43.045 --> 33:44.278
Yeah, I'm peachy.

33:49.518 --> 33:50.818
Michael, you're clear.

33:51.613 --> 33:53.914
Hurry up because these barrels
are filled with gas.

33:55.450 --> 33:56.851
And he's determined
to kill us.

33:59.154 --> 34:00.287
Let's move, Sam.

34:03.725 --> 34:05.493
Okay, Fi.
This is not good.

34:05.560 --> 34:07.561
Not liking the gasoline
on the ground here.

34:17.608 --> 34:18.663
They're right above him.

34:22.485 --> 34:24.627
Fi, we're one spark away from
going up like a Roman candle.

34:24.629 --> 34:25.762
We got to move.

34:25.830 --> 34:28.130
Wait. Mike, Mike.

34:28.199 --> 34:29.366
That antenna's
never gonna hold you.

34:29.434 --> 34:30.434
It has to!

34:30.501 --> 34:31.806
Fi and Jesse
won't last much longer.

34:31.808 --> 34:32.908
Mike, go. I got you.

34:32.976 --> 34:33.875
We got to go. Let's go.

34:48.472 --> 34:49.438
Don't move!

34:50.373 --> 34:52.108
I said don't move!

34:52.175 --> 34:54.076
Well done.
It's very well done.

35:11.762 --> 35:12.895
Fi, are you okay?

35:12.963 --> 35:14.997
Yeah, we're fine.
You got him?

35:16.233 --> 35:18.601
Yeah. I got him.

35:18.668 --> 35:20.636
Now we just sit tight and wait
for Card's extraction team.

35:20.704 --> 35:23.039
He said
it's already in the air.

35:23.106 --> 35:25.074
We did it, Fi.
Thank you.

35:25.142 --> 35:27.143
Okay.

35:33.250 --> 35:35.484
Something funny?

35:35.552 --> 35:37.720
You think you're waiting
for an extraction team, buddy,

35:37.788 --> 35:39.255
you got no clue.

35:39.322 --> 35:42.858
Card isn't sending
an extraction team for you.

35:44.428 --> 35:45.795
What are you
talking about?

35:45.862 --> 35:47.897
How do you know
about Card?

35:47.964 --> 35:49.865
Who do you think
sent me out here?

35:49.933 --> 35:52.468
This was supposed to be
a suicide mission for you.

35:55.005 --> 35:56.972
That's right.
A suicide mission.

35:57.040 --> 36:00.609
Westen goes down to Panama,
things go wrong,

36:00.677 --> 36:02.711
Westen gets ambushed
by a merc squad,

36:02.779 --> 36:05.414
Westen goes home in a box.

36:05.482 --> 36:07.817
Only one problem.

36:07.884 --> 36:09.919
You just won't die.

36:09.986 --> 36:11.620
That's a lie.

36:11.688 --> 36:15.157
Come on. You're a pro.
This smell right to you?

36:15.225 --> 36:17.960
Why -- why would Card
want me dead?

36:18.028 --> 36:20.863
Sorry, pal.
I just pull the trigger.

36:20.931 --> 36:23.833
You're asking questions
above my head.

36:23.900 --> 36:26.168
You know what?
We're running out of time.

36:26.236 --> 36:27.570
So if you're gonna kill me,
do it.

36:27.637 --> 36:29.171
If not, we need to
get the hell out of here.

36:29.239 --> 36:30.306
Yeah? Why is that?

36:30.373 --> 36:32.108
Because if Card
thinks I failed,

36:32.175 --> 36:33.742
he's gonna bring out
the big guns.

36:33.810 --> 36:35.311
He's gonna have to
wipe you out,

36:35.378 --> 36:37.113
probably wipe
this whole place with you.

36:37.180 --> 36:40.249
What?
You think I'm lying?

36:40.317 --> 36:41.817
Call him.

36:41.885 --> 36:44.787
Tell him I escaped,
that you want to go after me.

36:44.855 --> 36:46.222
I guarantee he tells you
to stay put,

36:46.289 --> 36:47.690
says help is on the way,

36:47.757 --> 36:49.458
that he already
has your location.

36:49.526 --> 36:50.593
Go ahead. Call him.

36:50.660 --> 36:52.328
Okay, Gray. All right.
I'll call him.

36:52.395 --> 36:53.696
Want to
play a little game?

36:53.763 --> 36:55.531
I'll call him.

37:00.270 --> 37:02.705
Oh, Michael.

37:02.772 --> 37:05.541
Thank God.
Almost gave me a heart attack.

37:05.609 --> 37:07.877
Bad news, Card.
Gray got away.

37:07.944 --> 37:09.612
We're regrouping now
to find him.

37:09.679 --> 37:11.714
No! No. No.

37:11.781 --> 37:13.549
Don't do that.
Stay put.

37:13.617 --> 37:16.418
I have operatives
on the ground in Panama.

37:16.486 --> 37:19.388
They're tracking Gray.
They're here now?

37:19.456 --> 37:20.890
Yes,
they just air-dropped in.

37:20.957 --> 37:22.525
We're getting a fix
on him.

37:22.592 --> 37:25.194
Looks like he's on foot
stepping into an alley.

37:25.262 --> 37:27.429
We're gonna have
that son of a bitch surrounded.

37:27.497 --> 37:28.931
We'll have him
in a few minutes.

37:28.999 --> 37:31.033
Michael...

37:31.101 --> 37:33.502
You did it.

37:33.570 --> 37:36.705
Thanks.

37:36.773 --> 37:39.475
Are you sure we shouldn't
meet your guys at the embassy?

37:39.543 --> 37:42.578
No. We have your location
off of your cellphone.

37:42.646 --> 37:48.350
You will wait for backup.
Don't move.

37:48.418 --> 37:50.152
You got that?

37:50.220 --> 37:52.488
Yeah, I got that.

37:52.556 --> 37:55.791
Good. Michael.

37:55.859 --> 37:59.461
I'm proud of you.

38:02.866 --> 38:05.000
He say
he was proud of you?

38:08.271 --> 38:10.206
Yeah, he told me
you like to hear that.

38:12.142 --> 38:14.376
Right before he told me
to go for the head shot.

38:23.264 --> 38:26.066
For what it's worth,
I, uh...

38:26.894 --> 38:28.661
I hope this helped.

38:28.729 --> 38:31.697
Nothing helps.

38:31.765 --> 38:35.268
But, um, maybe...

38:35.335 --> 38:37.303
you opened up
my eyes a bit.

38:37.371 --> 38:40.339
I know that some of that
wasn't easy to hear,

38:40.407 --> 38:42.008
but that's the one thing
you always get from me,

38:42.076 --> 38:43.776
Mrs. Westen,
is the truth.

38:43.844 --> 38:45.378
Card lied to us!

38:45.446 --> 38:47.947
He sent us down here to die!
Did Gray tell you that?

38:48.015 --> 38:49.982
What the hell you talking about?
We don't have time! We got to move!

38:51.485 --> 38:53.052
Drive! Drive!

38:59.126 --> 39:01.060
What is that?
Sounded like an F-18.

39:01.128 --> 39:03.930
Card sent an air strike
into Panama? That's insane.

39:03.997 --> 39:05.431
Not really.
Nobody knows we're here.

39:05.499 --> 39:07.233
Card can spin
any story he wants.

39:07.301 --> 39:08.601
Terrorist attack,
drug war.

39:19.146 --> 39:21.647
I was never easy
on Michael.

39:21.715 --> 39:23.049
I wasn't.

39:23.117 --> 39:25.084
But I did what I thought
I needed to do

39:25.152 --> 39:26.452
because I cared
about him.

39:26.520 --> 39:29.255
I do care about him.

39:29.323 --> 39:32.258
You see, I...

39:33.994 --> 39:36.262
I never had
a whole lot of family.

39:36.330 --> 39:39.732
In fact, Michael's the closest
thing I ever had to a son.

39:41.468 --> 39:42.702
We got maybe 30 seconds

39:42.769 --> 39:44.637
before that F-18 comes back
around to take us out.

39:44.705 --> 39:46.639
Let's not be in here
when it does.

39:46.707 --> 39:48.141
They're firing Mavericks.

39:48.208 --> 39:51.043
If we bail, we'll never get
clear of the blast radius.

39:51.111 --> 39:52.245
We have to try.

39:52.312 --> 39:55.381
We stop the van,
we get out all together.

39:55.449 --> 39:56.449
All right.
Let's do this.

40:05.025 --> 40:08.294
Brady?

40:12.833 --> 40:13.883
Brady!

40:13.890 --> 40:15.515
Mike, get under here!
We can't be seen!

40:15.540 --> 40:16.752
Brady!

40:37.024 --> 40:40.426
I know that this Agency
has cost you a lot.

40:40.494 --> 40:46.265
So, for what it's worth,
I am deeply, deeply sorry.

40:46.333 --> 40:48.834
Thank you.

40:48.902 --> 40:52.338
I'm glad Michael has you.

40:52.406 --> 40:54.173
Bye.

41:09.990 --> 41:11.857
Please tell me it's done.

41:22.336 --> 41:26.606
So...what the hell
do we do now?
