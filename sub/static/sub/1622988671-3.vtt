<i>‐</i>

00:18.403 --> 00:20.407
You are the master.

00:20.440 --> 00:23.480
You have unlimited power
on this canvas.

00:23.514 --> 00:26.352
This is probably the only place
I do have any power.

00:26.386 --> 00:29.191
But on this canvas, why,
I can do anything.

00:29.225 --> 00:32.832
Anything. And you can, too.

00:32.866 --> 00:35.572
You can, too.

00:35.605 --> 00:38.210
And maybe there's something
back in here.

00:38.243 --> 00:39.580
I want to put leaves

00:39.613 --> 00:41.316
on this tree,
so we're gonna lose

00:41.349 --> 00:43.353
a great deal of detail.

00:43.386 --> 00:45.525
Ooh, see, that one there,
he‐he had a rough life.

00:45.558 --> 00:47.428
Got bent and hurt.

00:48.463 --> 00:50.067
There we go.

00:52.606 --> 00:54.375
What? What is it? What's wrong?

00:54.408 --> 00:56.212
Nothing's wrong.

00:56.246 --> 00:57.248
Is it the painting guy?

00:57.281 --> 00:58.851
'Cause we don't have
to watch it anymore.

00:58.884 --> 01:01.222
Let's start here. Decide which
tree is farthest away.

01:01.256 --> 01:03.761
‐No, he's fine.
‐Okay.

01:03.794 --> 01:06.232
Well, why do you keep...

01:06.266 --> 01:08.571
like, you know?

01:08.604 --> 01:12.077
Your parents are downstairs.

01:12.111 --> 01:13.514
They're watching NCIS.

01:13.547 --> 01:15.551
They won't hear anything.
Come on.

01:15.585 --> 01:17.522
Okay. Chad.

01:17.555 --> 01:20.060
Jesus, Kelley, what the hell?

01:23.133 --> 01:24.435
I'm not comfortable.

01:24.468 --> 01:26.306
How many times
do I have to say that?

01:26.339 --> 01:28.443
It's just
that it's always something.

01:28.476 --> 01:30.247
You don't feel comfortable.

01:30.280 --> 01:32.284
My parents.
This isn't special enough.

01:32.318 --> 01:34.221
I mean, we've been together
for what, six months?

01:34.255 --> 01:36.459
‐All right, what's your point?
‐My point is

01:36.492 --> 01:38.463
is that it's not normal.

01:38.496 --> 01:41.469
Okay, wait, it's not a race.

01:41.503 --> 01:43.574
I‐I don't see
why we have to rush it

01:43.608 --> 01:44.776
and we can't just, like,
let it happen.

01:44.810 --> 01:46.145
It was happening.

01:46.179 --> 01:48.283
It was so happening
it's not even funny.

01:48.316 --> 01:49.620
I mean, just talk to me.
Tell me, is it...

01:49.653 --> 01:51.289
is it me or‐or what?

01:51.322 --> 01:53.159
It's not you. I just...

01:53.193 --> 01:55.565
I like to take my time.

01:55.598 --> 01:57.836
‐Since when?
‐What does that mean?

02:01.342 --> 02:02.612
Nothing. I didn't mean it.

02:02.646 --> 02:04.415
No, you can't
just throw that out there

02:04.448 --> 02:06.252
with that tone
and then say it's nothing.

02:06.285 --> 02:08.289
What did you mean?

02:08.323 --> 02:09.693
I mean,
you didn't wait six months

02:09.726 --> 02:10.862
when you were with Tom Jarecki.

02:10.895 --> 02:13.199
And who told you that?

02:13.233 --> 02:14.870
Tom Jarecki?

02:16.272 --> 02:18.310
All right, look,
I shouldn't have

02:18.343 --> 02:20.347
‐said anything. I'm sorry.
I just... No, no, no.
‐Yeah, no shit.

02:20.380 --> 02:21.784
Kelley, what are you doing?
Where are you going?

02:21.817 --> 02:23.754
You're being an asshole.
I'm going home.

02:23.788 --> 02:25.324
What about the history test?

02:25.357 --> 02:27.494
One of us is gonna fail it.

02:27.529 --> 02:29.766
I'll let you guess who.

02:29.800 --> 02:31.670
Kelley.

02:32.706 --> 02:34.408
Kelley!

02:38.684 --> 02:40.387
Beat the devil out of it.

02:40.420 --> 02:42.391
‐Go back to...
‐

02:42.424 --> 02:45.230
I'm gonna die a virgin.

02:51.275 --> 02:52.545
I still can't believe
you thought

02:52.579 --> 02:54.215
that Happy Painter shit
was gonna work.

02:54.248 --> 02:57.655
auto sensory meridian response.

02:57.689 --> 02:58.958
What's that?

02:58.991 --> 03:00.460
It's this hyper‐relaxed
mental state,

03:00.494 --> 03:03.233
and people who watch Bob Ross
are supposed to get it big‐time.

03:03.266 --> 03:04.870
Guy on reddit
said it's like a head orgasm.

03:04.903 --> 03:06.305
Female Viagra.

03:06.339 --> 03:07.575
How'd you even get her
to watch it?

03:07.609 --> 03:08.878
Told her it was a game.

03:08.911 --> 03:10.815
Every time he says
"happy trees," we kiss.

03:10.848 --> 03:13.420
And it was going amazing.

03:13.453 --> 03:15.390
Till it wasn't.

03:15.424 --> 03:18.229
Do you want to know what makes
girls get on the crazy train?

03:18.263 --> 03:19.933
It's not about relaxation.

03:19.966 --> 03:21.737
It's fear.

03:21.770 --> 03:23.406
Fear?

03:23.440 --> 03:25.845
Why do you think
horror films were invented?

03:25.878 --> 03:27.582
Back in the 1930s,
do you think guys were bringing

03:27.615 --> 03:29.218
their sweethearts
to watch Dracula

03:29.251 --> 03:31.590
because they liked
Tod Browning's mise‐en‐scène?

03:31.623 --> 03:33.928
No, dude. They wanted Lugosi

03:33.961 --> 03:35.531
to give them a chance
at some skirt.

03:35.565 --> 03:37.000
Fear is the ticket.

03:37.034 --> 03:39.539
You tickle
that fight‐or‐flight response,

03:39.573 --> 03:42.244
she's an oyster
ready for shucking.

03:42.277 --> 03:45.317
‐
‐Or I could just stop
trying to coerce her

03:45.350 --> 03:46.419
and let her do it
when she's ready.

03:46.452 --> 03:47.956
Bro, this is not
the time to bring

03:47.989 --> 03:50.595
a knife to a gunfight.
Your reputation's at stake.

03:50.628 --> 03:53.299
All right,
horror films suck now.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.838
They're either low‐rent shit
to fill up a streaming menu

03:55.872 --> 03:58.410
or pretentious crap
that puts you to sleep.

03:58.443 --> 04:00.948
‐What's left?
‐Didn't you hear

04:00.982 --> 04:02.719
about how drive‐in
movie theaters are coming back?

04:02.752 --> 04:05.023
Well, those film nuts
who restored Starlite

04:05.056 --> 04:06.426
are having a screening.

04:06.459 --> 04:08.898
They got a print
of Rabbit Rabbit.

04:08.931 --> 04:11.035
Rabbit Rabbit? What is that?

04:11.068 --> 04:13.373
Just the most infamous cursed film

04:13.406 --> 04:14.643
in cinema history.

04:14.676 --> 04:17.582
It was only ever shown once
back in '86.

04:17.615 --> 04:20.387
Maybe it's not cursed.
Maybe it just sucks.

04:20.420 --> 04:22.291
Or maybe
when the screening was over,

04:22.324 --> 04:23.627
six people were dead.

04:23.661 --> 04:25.665
Massacred.

04:28.838 --> 04:31.777
At first, they thought it was,
like, a shooting or a gang fight

04:31.810 --> 04:33.346
that got real.

04:33.379 --> 04:34.549
But survivors say
that the audience

04:34.583 --> 04:36.285
just started attacking
each other.

04:36.319 --> 04:38.591
‐
‐They just went crazy.

04:38.624 --> 04:41.062
There were all these theories
that someone spiked

04:41.095 --> 04:43.466
the soda machine with shrooms
or a gas leak

04:43.501 --> 04:45.370
or even hallucinogenic mold.

04:45.403 --> 04:46.573
But if you read
Bloody Disgusting

04:46.607 --> 04:48.711
or Dread Central,
you know the other story.

04:50.013 --> 04:51.850
That the film
made those people crazy.

04:51.884 --> 04:54.021
‐The film?
‐Yeah. The picture
and the sound.

04:54.054 --> 04:55.658
Somehow,
they fuck with the brain.

04:55.691 --> 04:57.427
Okay.

04:57.461 --> 04:59.031
Tell me why they hauled the
director in front of Congress,

04:59.064 --> 05:00.501
why he ended up doing time,

05:00.535 --> 05:02.672
and why they destroyed
all of the prints.

05:02.705 --> 05:04.308
Or, at least, they thought.

05:04.341 --> 05:05.678
‐
‐Word is

05:05.711 --> 05:07.481
the print came
from the director himself.

05:07.515 --> 05:09.619
Could be the only one
in existence.

05:09.653 --> 05:11.690
I got up at 3:00 a.m.
to snag the tickets.

05:11.723 --> 05:13.794
There's only room for 60 cars.

05:13.828 --> 05:15.463
I got one extra ticket
if you want it.

05:15.497 --> 05:17.434
‐Not cheap.
‐What's it even about?

05:17.467 --> 05:20.608
I don't know. I don't even know
what the title means.

05:20.641 --> 05:23.581
I guess we'll find out.
If we live through it.

05:24.649 --> 05:26.520
All right, hold on.
Tell me that you guys

05:26.553 --> 05:27.722
aren't actually believing

05:27.755 --> 05:29.860
that this film's
gonna turn people into killers.

05:29.893 --> 05:31.864
Well, I mean, no.

05:31.897 --> 05:34.669
I‐It's an urban legend,
but who cares?

05:34.703 --> 05:37.341
All that matters
is that it might be true.

05:37.374 --> 05:38.443
Fight‐or‐flight.

05:38.476 --> 05:40.413
I mean, you and Kelley

05:40.447 --> 05:41.315
alone in your car

05:41.349 --> 05:43.353
watching the most dangerous film
ever made.

05:43.386 --> 05:45.691
Trust me. The Happy Painter?

05:45.725 --> 05:47.629
Think about how happy you're gonna be

05:47.662 --> 05:50.400
when she's painting your dick
with her lips.

05:50.433 --> 05:52.471
Ooh!

05:54.008 --> 05:56.513
Six people are dead,

05:56.547 --> 05:58.884
killed watching your movie.

05:58.918 --> 06:01.155
This committee is absurd.

06:01.188 --> 06:02.559
We're Americans

06:02.592 --> 06:06.432
concerned about the effect
of violent content

06:06.465 --> 06:08.136
on our society.

06:08.169 --> 06:11.643
In an interview
with Fangoria magazine,

06:11.677 --> 06:14.481
you said that your film,
and I quote,

06:14.516 --> 06:17.421
"would break people's souls"

06:17.454 --> 06:19.491
and that anyone who saw it

06:19.526 --> 06:21.897
would be damaged forever.

06:21.930 --> 06:24.034
Well, I was, uh,
promoting my movie.

06:24.068 --> 06:26.105
Like you're helping me do
right now.

06:26.138 --> 06:27.842
So, you think
all of this attention

06:27.875 --> 06:29.913
will just increase
your audience?

06:29.946 --> 06:34.589
I think if you're not getting
a check from studio publicity,

06:34.623 --> 06:36.425
you're getting ripped off.

06:36.459 --> 06:37.695
‐
‐Funny
you should say that,

06:37.729 --> 06:39.031
Mr. Bitterman.

06:39.064 --> 06:40.635
I did get something
from the studio,

06:40.668 --> 06:42.538
but it wasn't a check.

06:42.572 --> 06:43.774
It was a letter

06:43.807 --> 06:48.550
stating they've agreed
to pull your movie immediately.

06:48.584 --> 06:51.590
Not only that.
They're going to destroy

06:51.623 --> 06:54.128
every print in existence.

06:54.161 --> 06:57.769
What do you have to say
about that, Mr. Bitterman?

06:58.971 --> 07:02.144
Well? No pithy comment?

07:02.177 --> 07:04.081
You bitch!

07:09.526 --> 07:10.628
‐
‐I'm gonna kill you.

07:10.661 --> 07:13.801
‐I'm gonna kill you!
‐This guy is crazy.

07:15.905 --> 07:18.544
I won't stop until the whole
world sees my movie!

08:19.807 --> 08:22.739
-I honestly just think
he's scared, you know?

08:22.772 --> 08:25.010
It's a guy thing.
If you don't score

08:25.043 --> 08:26.913
by a certain time,
you're, like, a loser.

08:26.947 --> 08:28.784
You know what I think?

08:28.817 --> 08:31.088
‐What?
‐I think you're scared.

08:31.122 --> 08:34.094
‐Of what?
‐The dick.

08:34.128 --> 08:36.533
‐
‐Look, you tell yourself

08:36.566 --> 08:38.169
that you want to take it slow
'cause he's sweet

08:38.202 --> 08:39.606
and you don't want
to scare him off,

08:39.639 --> 08:42.010
but really,
you're just scared of the dick.

08:42.044 --> 08:44.181
That's stupid.

08:44.214 --> 08:46.620
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
Look, as an owner

08:46.653 --> 08:48.189
and a proud connoisseur
of the dick,

08:48.222 --> 08:50.961
there is no reason
to fear the dick.

08:50.995 --> 08:54.068
No, I mean that that is stupid
like I'm not scared of the dick.

08:54.101 --> 08:55.738
You wouldn't even go there
with Tom Jarecki.

08:55.771 --> 08:59.713
Jesus Christ. Did Tom Jarecki
open a website? Because

08:59.746 --> 09:01.248
half the school thinks that
I screwed him, and I didn't.

09:01.282 --> 09:03.186
And why? Because he was a jerk.

09:03.219 --> 09:04.956
And his pits smell weird.

09:04.989 --> 09:06.827
Thank God
there's always an excuse.

09:06.860 --> 09:09.566
"He's a jerk. He's smelly." Mm.

09:09.599 --> 09:11.068
‐Ew. Why?
‐That right there.

09:11.102 --> 09:13.239
Your reaction. It says a lot.

09:13.272 --> 09:14.609
Yeah, it says I don't like

09:14.642 --> 09:16.045
people sticking their fingers
in my ear.

09:16.078 --> 09:17.982
Girl, it's just another orifice.

09:18.015 --> 09:19.586
If you can't handle
a finger in your ear,

09:19.619 --> 09:22.090
how are you gonna handle
a dick in your...

09:22.124 --> 09:23.794
There he is.

09:23.827 --> 09:24.996
My fanboy.

09:25.029 --> 09:26.666
He's obsessed with me.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.771
Me. As I am.

09:28.804 --> 09:30.240
It's everything.

09:30.273 --> 09:32.077
As he should be. You're lucky.

09:32.110 --> 09:34.114
Not as lucky
as he's gonna be tomorrow night.

09:34.148 --> 09:35.651
Oh, and you need to go

09:35.684 --> 09:38.724
talk to your mans
while he's still your mans.

09:46.105 --> 09:47.642
Uh...

09:47.675 --> 09:51.315
Prohibition wasn't
about the women's vote, was it?

09:51.348 --> 09:54.021
‐No.
‐No.

09:54.054 --> 09:55.624
That was suffrage.

09:55.658 --> 09:59.064
Yeah, I don't think the rest
of that test went any better.

10:01.837 --> 10:02.839
Don't.

10:02.872 --> 10:03.941
Don't what?

10:03.974 --> 10:05.076
You're about to say
you're sorry.

10:05.110 --> 10:06.880
Yeah.

10:06.913 --> 10:09.351
Yeah, and that I shouldn't
have pressured you

10:09.384 --> 10:12.825
and that I should
probably be canceled

10:12.859 --> 10:14.027
for life.

10:14.061 --> 10:15.698
I hate apologies.

10:15.731 --> 10:17.869
Making them. Getting them.

10:17.902 --> 10:21.142
Just...
Just a thing with me, so...

10:22.912 --> 10:24.716
Let's just pretend
last night didn't happen.

10:26.185 --> 10:28.022
Wish I could do that
with the history test,

10:28.055 --> 10:30.160
‐but...
‐

10:31.796 --> 10:33.366
Well, since we're
still going out‐‐

10:33.399 --> 10:35.170
at least, I think
we're still going out, right?‐‐

10:35.203 --> 10:38.811
‐Right.
‐and you won't let me say
I'm sorry,

10:38.844 --> 10:41.182
I got these tickets for this
really cool event tomorrow night

10:41.215 --> 10:43.152
if you wanted to come.

10:43.186 --> 10:45.658
It's once‐in‐a‐lifetime.

10:45.691 --> 10:48.697
Oh, well, I never say no
to once‐in‐a‐lifetime.

10:51.402 --> 10:53.172
Listen to me!

10:53.206 --> 10:55.376
This movie is cursed!

10:57.180 --> 10:59.151
It's real!

10:59.184 --> 11:02.090
It's not an urban legend.

11:02.123 --> 11:03.961
I was there.

11:03.994 --> 11:06.766
I was there in '86!

11:06.800 --> 11:09.071
Don't you see
what happened to me?

11:09.104 --> 11:11.375
It's real!

11:11.408 --> 11:14.047
I'm telling you! Listen to me!

11:14.081 --> 11:15.684
This movie is cursed!

11:15.718 --> 11:17.220
Want me to run her off?

11:17.254 --> 11:19.358
‐I was there!
‐Technically,
she's on our property.

11:19.391 --> 11:20.761
‐I saw the blood.
‐

11:20.794 --> 11:22.197
Leave her where she is.

11:22.230 --> 11:23.867
She adds mystique.

11:23.901 --> 11:27.207
I am worried
about this asshat delivery guy.

11:27.240 --> 11:30.714
He was supposed to be here
with the print a half hour ago.

11:30.748 --> 11:32.284
Shit, Verna,
we don't have the movie?

11:32.317 --> 11:34.288
"Shit" is right.

11:34.321 --> 11:37.795
This one screening is supposed
to put us in the black.

11:37.828 --> 11:40.099
If we have
to hand out refunds...

11:40.133 --> 11:42.237
‐You're going to die!
‐There'll be people dying,
all right.

11:42.270 --> 11:45.243
‐Us.

‐What's up, boys?
‐What's happening?
‐Hi.

13:13.620 --> 13:16.358
That's not a restrike.
That's an original one sheet.

13:16.392 --> 13:18.496
‐What does the title even mean?
‐I googled it.

13:18.530 --> 13:20.233
It's, uh,
an old British superstition.

13:20.266 --> 13:23.472
On the first day of the month,
you say "rabbit, rabbit."

13:23.507 --> 13:25.009
It's supposed to buy you
30 days of good luck.

13:25.043 --> 13:27.915
Weird title
for a movie that's cursed.

13:27.948 --> 13:29.251
How bummed are you guys gonna be
when the movie ends

13:29.284 --> 13:30.386
and everyone's still alive?

13:30.420 --> 13:32.057
There's always tomorrow.

13:32.090 --> 13:33.560
Tomorrow?

13:33.593 --> 13:36.332
4chan says there's an encore
screening happening somewhere,

13:36.365 --> 13:38.235
but I can't find where.

13:38.269 --> 13:39.505
Oh, there's Dee.

13:39.539 --> 13:42.210
And I don't want to die
on an empty stomach, so...

13:42.243 --> 13:43.245
You want anything?

13:43.279 --> 13:46.418
I'll have popcorn
and a Mountain Dew, please.

13:46.452 --> 13:47.621
‐As you wish.
‐Thank you.

13:47.655 --> 13:50.928
Hey, I'm sensing a vibe.

13:50.961 --> 13:53.633
You a happy little tree?
You gonna get your brush clean?

13:53.667 --> 13:57.207
Uh... Think I'm just gonna have
a good time tonight, you know?

13:57.240 --> 13:58.977
It'll happen when it happens.

13:59.011 --> 14:01.248
Your boy's looking tasty.

14:01.281 --> 14:03.285
‐Huh?
‐Don't start on me.

14:03.319 --> 14:05.991
Girl, I'm trying to get you
to start on him.

14:06.025 --> 14:08.897
Don't fear the dick. Right.

14:08.930 --> 14:10.433
All I can say is

14:10.466 --> 14:13.305
I don't need this movie
to turn me into a killer,

14:13.339 --> 14:14.575
'cause I'm eating that boy alive

14:14.609 --> 14:16.579
the second
the credits start rolling.

14:16.613 --> 14:19.117
As long as I don't
scare him off.

14:19.151 --> 14:20.420
Or chicken out.

14:20.453 --> 14:23.225
You won't.
You got this. You got this.

14:31.643 --> 14:33.847
Oh, shit, that's the print.

14:35.283 --> 14:36.485
Holy shit.

14:38.189 --> 14:39.559
‐
‐Hey!

14:39.592 --> 14:40.994
Crazy bitch.

14:41.028 --> 14:42.197
Hey!

14:42.230 --> 14:45.303
‐What's your name?
‐Uh, my name's Chad.

14:45.336 --> 14:46.573
Chad, find the fuse box

14:46.606 --> 14:48.042
and kill the power.

14:48.075 --> 14:49.946
Anything.

14:49.979 --> 14:51.683
Don't let this happen!

14:51.716 --> 14:54.454
Don't let what happen?
It's just a movie.

14:54.488 --> 14:56.391
I was there in '86.

14:56.425 --> 14:59.064
Me and my boyfriend,
we were Chain Saw fans,

14:59.097 --> 15:01.335
and this
was supposed to be scarier.

15:01.368 --> 15:02.638
It wasn't even halfway over

15:02.671 --> 15:05.376
before he was dead
and I'd lost this.

15:05.410 --> 15:07.480
My boyfriend ripped it out
with his teeth

15:07.515 --> 15:09.117
and swallowed it.

15:09.151 --> 15:11.990
Hey! Little help?

15:12.023 --> 15:14.494
If you care about her,
you'll do something.

15:14.529 --> 15:16.331
At least get out of here!

15:16.365 --> 15:18.335
Yeah, I'm sorry, I got to go.

15:18.369 --> 15:20.306
Listen to me!

15:20.339 --> 15:22.310
It starts right away!

15:22.343 --> 15:24.414
Don't look!

15:24.448 --> 15:26.553
‐Don't let her look!
‐Thanks.

15:26.586 --> 15:28.924
Let's go. Come on.

15:39.512 --> 15:42.350
You want to give me
some space, buddy?

15:42.383 --> 15:44.522
You run these
at full juice, right?

15:44.555 --> 15:46.526
The sender wants to know.

15:46.559 --> 15:49.364
He says the movie
requires 16 footlamberts

15:49.397 --> 15:51.101
for the proper experience.

15:52.137 --> 15:54.642
You tell your sender
I ran the Kinotons

15:54.675 --> 15:58.349
at the Osiris on Broadway
for 40 years.

15:58.382 --> 16:00.186
I threaded Tatum O'Neal's first

16:00.219 --> 16:02.691
and Joan Crawford's last.

16:02.725 --> 16:07.066
When Kubrick tried to lecture me
on aspect ratios for Clockwork,

16:07.100 --> 16:09.004
I told him to go fuck himself.

16:09.037 --> 16:11.643
You know why you raise
the volume in a New York theater

16:11.676 --> 16:13.112
during the winter?

16:13.145 --> 16:15.416
Because all the winter coats
suck up the sound

16:15.449 --> 16:19.257
and everything goes dead.
I know what I'm doing.

16:21.696 --> 16:24.234
"Proper experience."

saying to you?

16:40.466 --> 16:42.103

You sound like you believe her.

16:46.513 --> 16:49.284
Just, I'm not sure
she's a plant.

16:49.317 --> 16:51.455
You know, she was really upset.

16:51.488 --> 16:52.625
Okay, well,
if you're trying to scare me,

16:52.658 --> 16:53.960
it's not gonna work.

16:56.833 --> 17:00.039
‐Okay, maybe a little.
‐

17:03.613 --> 17:08.222
You know the other night
when we had that fight?

17:09.692 --> 17:11.428
Yeah.

17:11.461 --> 17:14.434
You were wrong.

17:14.467 --> 17:17.440
It wasn't six months.

17:18.643 --> 17:21.415
Tonight is six months.

17:21.448 --> 17:23.820
Exactly.

17:23.853 --> 17:25.657
Hmm.

17:27.460 --> 17:30.399
And I want to make it special.

17:37.681 --> 17:40.152
‐Sparkling ice‐cold...
‐I can't believe it.

17:40.186 --> 17:42.190
These are restored CBX Mark IIs.

17:42.223 --> 17:44.629
I so love drive‐in speaker porn,

17:44.662 --> 17:46.799
but you better look at me
right now.

17:47.835 --> 17:49.538
This is a big deal.

17:49.572 --> 17:52.511
I never thought
I'd be doing this with a guy.

17:52.544 --> 17:54.114
Doing what?

17:54.147 --> 17:56.619
You know how some people
need a lot of dates

17:56.653 --> 17:59.659
‐before they put out?
‐Yeah.

17:59.692 --> 18:01.829
I'm not one of those people.

18:01.863 --> 18:03.633
...fresh, tasty popcorn

18:03.667 --> 18:06.539
where that came from.
Try some. You'll enjoy it.

18:09.679 --> 18:11.649
And now,

18:11.683 --> 18:13.720
‐our feature presentation.
‐

18:27.548 --> 18:29.785
Story of my life.

19:07.628 --> 19:09.732
‐Forget the movie.
‐Mm.

19:56.826 --> 19:59.364
‐

20:34.000 --> 20:35.637
‐

20:35.670 --> 20:37.708
What was that?

20:37.741 --> 20:39.712
Did you hear that?

20:53.606 --> 20:55.009
Hey!

20:55.042 --> 20:57.046
What are you doing in here?

20:57.079 --> 21:00.286
‐

21:08.335 --> 21:09.538
Holy shit!

21:14.915 --> 21:16.919

21:21.762 --> 21:23.700
‐

21:27.641 --> 21:29.377
‐

21:30.747 --> 21:31.983
I can't see anything.

21:35.790 --> 21:36.859
No, no. Wait, wait, hold on.

21:36.893 --> 21:37.728
We don't
know what's happening out there.

21:37.761 --> 21:39.364
It's got to be a joke.

21:39.397 --> 21:42.036
Like the protester,
part of the show.

21:43.573 --> 21:44.909
Go!

21:44.942 --> 21:47.781
Go! Go! Get us out of here!

21:50.620 --> 21:52.089
‐Go! Go! Start the car!
‐I'm going!

21:54.728 --> 21:55.964
‐

22:08.590 --> 22:10.660
‐
‐What the fuck?!

22:13.533 --> 22:15.871
‐Go! Watch out!
‐Okay, I don't know
where I'm going.

22:18.676 --> 22:20.379
Dee?

22:20.412 --> 22:21.749
Keep driving.

22:21.782 --> 22:23.820
‐Dee?
‐Don't stop! Drive the car!

22:25.891 --> 22:27.426
I can see the entrance.
There it is!

22:27.460 --> 22:29.565
Go! Fast!

22:29.598 --> 22:30.800
I can't see.

22:36.879 --> 22:38.716
You okay?

22:40.119 --> 22:42.089
Oh, shit.

22:42.123 --> 22:43.993
We got to go.

22:45.029 --> 22:46.431
Come on.

22:46.464 --> 22:47.935
Come on, we got to go.

22:47.968 --> 22:50.507
Come on.

22:52.076 --> 22:54.848
‐
‐Go. Go.

23:05.503 --> 23:07.808
‐Chad!
‐Go!

23:07.841 --> 23:08.810
Go! Go!

23:24.173 --> 23:25.877
Oh, my God.

23:31.822 --> 23:34.628
Their faces are chewed off.

23:38.870 --> 23:40.840
This can't be happening.

23:40.874 --> 23:43.680
‐This can't be happening.
‐Shit. Kelley.

23:43.713 --> 23:45.884
‐What?
‐I don't have my phone.

23:48.188 --> 23:49.858
I don't have mine, either.

23:49.892 --> 23:52.196
Hold on, maybe
there's a landline in here.

23:52.229 --> 23:54.033
Um...

23:54.067 --> 23:55.904
Uh...

23:55.937 --> 23:59.177
Fuck! It's fucking dead.

24:00.179 --> 24:03.151
‐

24:33.245 --> 24:34.180
Chad

24:37.186 --> 24:38.823
Chad!

24:39.958 --> 24:43.131
‐

24:47.039 --> 24:49.077
‐

24:59.832 --> 25:00.934
Die! Die!

25:00.967 --> 25:04.173
Fucking die! Die! Die!

25:04.207 --> 25:05.944
‐Bitch, die!
‐Chad!

25:05.977 --> 25:07.246
‐Chad, stop! Chad!
‐

25:07.279 --> 25:09.651
Chad, she's dead!
She‐She's dead!

25:20.974 --> 25:23.078
Fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

25:30.794 --> 25:32.831
‐

25:43.786 --> 25:45.122
How long?

25:47.159 --> 25:49.765
A few hours.

25:49.798 --> 25:52.002
I let you sleep.

26:07.667 --> 26:10.607
A lot of them ran off.

26:10.640 --> 26:12.978
God knows what they're doing.

26:13.011 --> 26:15.315
There's got to be a phone
out there we can use.

26:15.349 --> 26:18.155
We got to call the police.

26:18.188 --> 26:19.858
And tell them what?

26:19.892 --> 26:23.265
That a movie
turned everyone into killers?

26:23.298 --> 26:25.068
‐It's what happened.
‐The cops are gonna

26:25.102 --> 26:27.306
lock us in a room
and ask us questions all day,

26:27.339 --> 26:29.645
and more people
are gonna get ripped apart.

26:29.678 --> 26:31.649
‐More people?
‐Milo said

26:31.682 --> 26:33.051
there's another screening
tonight, remember?

26:33.084 --> 26:34.955
Holy shit.

26:34.988 --> 26:37.828
Which means
there's another print.

26:37.861 --> 26:40.032
Well, this one came
from the director.

26:42.069 --> 26:43.840
So then we find him...

26:44.908 --> 26:46.879
...and we cancel night two.

26:49.350 --> 26:51.020
It was behind the desk.

26:54.695 --> 26:58.335
The delivery service
that dropped off the print.

26:58.368 --> 26:59.905
They can tell us
where they picked it up from.

27:00.940 --> 27:02.176
Let's go.

27:04.715 --> 27:07.119
Hold on, wait.

27:07.153 --> 27:08.956
Look, I know what you said
about the police,

27:08.990 --> 27:10.960
but we can't do this
by ourselves.

27:10.994 --> 27:13.365
They stand a much better chance
of finding this guy than we do.

27:13.398 --> 27:15.102
‐We just got to convince them...
‐No, Chad.

27:15.135 --> 27:17.072
Wait, Kelley.

27:20.245 --> 27:21.916
Are you good with that?

27:23.385 --> 27:25.790
My dad's a Marine.

27:25.824 --> 27:27.761
Point, pump and pull.

28:26.779 --> 28:27.814
Come on.

28:37.099 --> 28:38.836
Quinn?

28:41.942 --> 28:43.144
Quinn.

28:44.180 --> 28:46.150
Hey, man, it's me.

28:47.186 --> 28:48.723
It's Chad.

28:50.492 --> 28:52.296
Your friend.

28:52.329 --> 28:54.935
We've been friends
since the eighth grade, man.

28:54.968 --> 28:55.904
Just think.

28:55.937 --> 28:58.074
Remember.

28:58.108 --> 29:00.947
Remember when we made hash in
Mr. Thanski's chemistry class

29:00.980 --> 29:03.318
and the school
almost called the DEA on us?

29:03.351 --> 29:05.489
‐Chad.
‐Hold on.

29:05.523 --> 29:06.825
Quinn.

29:06.859 --> 29:08.829
Okay? Think.

29:08.863 --> 29:12.036
Or when, uh,
when Milo was watching porn

29:12.069 --> 29:13.338
and he
accidentally Bluetoothed it

29:13.371 --> 29:14.875
to the school intercom.
Do you remember that?

29:15.877 --> 29:16.946
Quinn.

29:16.979 --> 29:18.248
Look at me, man.

29:19.518 --> 29:21.454
Just think.

29:22.891 --> 29:24.327
It's me.

29:29.136 --> 29:31.307
‐

29:47.006 --> 29:49.243
You're right.

29:49.276 --> 29:51.982
Let's find a car,

29:52.016 --> 29:53.819
and let's hunt
this fucking director down.

30:05.275 --> 30:07.947
Yeah, that's the van.

30:07.981 --> 30:12.289
Who lives in a trailer
and drives a Rolls‐Royce?

30:12.323 --> 30:15.228
‐
‐Let's find out.

30:29.190 --> 30:30.993
One officer was quoted as saying

30:31.027 --> 30:33.933
the carnage is unlike anything
he's ever seen.

30:33.966 --> 30:35.870
Now, there are
unconfirmed reports

30:35.903 --> 30:38.876
of attacks spreading into
the surrounding neighborhoods,

30:38.909 --> 30:41.414
but so far,
no one will go on record

30:41.447 --> 30:43.919
as to exactly what
has happened here.

30:43.953 --> 30:46.024
I kicked ass is what happened.

30:46.057 --> 30:48.929
Cinema fucking history
is what happened!

30:48.963 --> 30:50.900
...at least 100 people...

30:50.933 --> 30:52.403
The chickens didn't
just come home to roost...

30:55.977 --> 30:57.146
Who the hell are you?

30:57.179 --> 30:59.150
The chickens, I guess.

30:59.183 --> 31:01.054
You must be Larry Bitterman.

31:01.087 --> 31:04.060
‐What is this?
‐We were there last night.

31:04.093 --> 31:06.230
At the Starlite Drive‐In.

31:06.264 --> 31:08.368
To see your movie.

31:08.401 --> 31:11.040
I don't... I don't know
what you're talking about.

31:11.074 --> 31:14.080
Trust us, that is not the road
that you want to take.

31:14.113 --> 31:15.917
‐We've had a long night.
‐

31:15.950 --> 31:18.054
Okay, take it easy.

31:18.088 --> 31:20.292
What is it?
Just tell me what you want.

31:20.325 --> 31:21.929
We want the other print.

31:21.962 --> 31:23.298
The other print?

31:23.331 --> 31:25.035
For the screening tonight.

31:25.068 --> 31:26.939
Oh, I'm sorry to say
you've been misinformed.

31:26.972 --> 31:28.108
That...

31:28.141 --> 31:30.947
That was a one‐time‐only event.

31:30.980 --> 31:32.449
That was
the last and final print.

31:32.483 --> 31:33.986
I promise.

31:34.019 --> 31:35.623
‐It was on 4chan.
‐

31:35.656 --> 31:38.629
Which means that you're
the last people on earth

31:38.662 --> 31:39.965
who believe
what's on the Internet.

31:39.998 --> 31:41.367
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.071
If you were at the drive‐in
watching the movie,

31:43.104 --> 31:45.142
why weren't...
I mean, why aren't you...?

31:47.146 --> 31:49.116
You weren't even

31:49.150 --> 31:51.087
paying attention, were you?
You were too busy

31:51.120 --> 31:52.590
laying pipe.

31:52.624 --> 31:54.126
See, this is why
I hated the idea

31:54.160 --> 31:56.097
of premiering at a drive‐in.

31:56.130 --> 31:58.368
Half the people are raw dogging
it at any given time.

32:00.105 --> 32:02.242
But you must've seen
what happened, right?

32:02.276 --> 32:04.246
Please...

32:04.280 --> 32:06.985
Paint me a word picture.

32:07.019 --> 32:10.626
It was my finest hour,
and I couldn't be there.

32:10.660 --> 32:12.530
Your finest hour?

32:12.564 --> 32:15.135
Everyone went crazy.

32:15.168 --> 32:16.237
They were
tearing each other apart.

32:16.270 --> 32:18.108
"Everyone"?

32:18.141 --> 32:20.479
Every person who watched
was affected?

32:20.513 --> 32:22.483
The response was 100%?

32:25.155 --> 32:28.161
‐Unbelievable.
‐Our friends are dead,
and you're talking

32:28.194 --> 32:30.165
like it's an experiment
or a game score.

32:30.198 --> 32:32.002
It's neither. It's a...

32:32.035 --> 32:34.641
It's an experience.
It's a cinematic happening.

32:34.674 --> 32:36.545
A horror movie

32:36.578 --> 32:39.016
where the horror
isn't on‐screen.

32:39.049 --> 32:40.152
It's in the audience.

32:41.487 --> 32:43.559
Try to appreciate
what I'm talking about. Come on!

32:43.592 --> 32:45.262
I mean, you two must be

32:45.295 --> 32:47.166
film buffs or you wouldn't
have been there last night,

32:47.199 --> 32:50.305
so you must know about the, uh,
subliminals in The Exorcist?

32:56.718 --> 32:58.722
William Friedkin

32:58.756 --> 33:02.129
cut two frames of a demon's face
into reel six.

33:03.431 --> 33:05.570
People were throwing up
in the aisles.

33:05.603 --> 33:08.041
There were cases
of women going into labor.

33:08.074 --> 33:10.212
One gave birth
right in the theater.

33:10.245 --> 33:12.082
People thought
they were possessed,

33:12.115 --> 33:13.586
and all because of two frames,

33:13.619 --> 33:15.088
two little frames,

33:15.121 --> 33:17.159
and some creative sound.

33:17.192 --> 33:19.096
In certain spots,

33:19.129 --> 33:21.100
we mixed in the sound
of an angry beehive.

33:21.133 --> 33:23.071
Oh, really got
on people's nerves.

33:23.104 --> 33:26.210
Guess whose idea it was,
the subliminals.

33:26.244 --> 33:27.547
Yours?

33:28.582 --> 33:30.418
Second assistant cutter.

33:30.452 --> 33:32.322
We changed film forever.

33:32.356 --> 33:34.326
We should've won Best Picture
that year.

33:34.360 --> 33:36.698
You know what did? The Sting.

33:36.732 --> 33:38.201
It was a travesty!

33:38.234 --> 33:39.738
I couldn't let that stand.

33:39.771 --> 33:41.608
I had to take it
to the next level.

33:41.642 --> 33:45.215
So I raised money
for my own movie.

33:45.248 --> 33:47.620
I was after the recipe, you see.

33:47.654 --> 33:51.494
The‐the universal combination
of image and sound

33:51.528 --> 33:53.097
that would trigger

33:53.131 --> 33:54.801
the fear center
of every human brain.

33:54.834 --> 33:57.239
I studied
intrusive memory formation,

33:57.272 --> 33:59.578
the CIA hijinks with MK‐Ultra.

33:59.611 --> 34:01.748
Did you know flashes
of 330 hertz

34:01.782 --> 34:06.625
can trigger seizures
even in people without epilepsy?

34:06.658 --> 34:08.596
I applied everything I learned

34:08.629 --> 34:12.236
like Edison
creating the light bulb.

34:12.269 --> 34:14.541
I used thousands of combinations

34:14.574 --> 34:17.212
until one day, it happened.

34:25.696 --> 34:27.800
I gave my editor some notes,

34:27.834 --> 34:30.272
and I came by
to see what she'd done.

34:30.305 --> 34:32.075
‐
‐Lanie?

34:43.565 --> 34:45.101
Lanie, what are you...

34:48.542 --> 34:51.280
They put her away.
Combination of overwork

34:51.314 --> 34:53.251
and drugs.

34:53.284 --> 34:55.656
I knew the real score.

34:55.690 --> 34:59.330
I knew the film was ready.

35:00.332 --> 35:01.835
I found a distributor.

35:01.868 --> 35:04.139
Opened in one regional venue.

35:04.173 --> 35:06.645
Just a special engagement
to build word of mouth.

35:06.678 --> 35:08.448
And the response

35:08.481 --> 35:10.519
was beyond my expectations.

35:10.553 --> 35:12.456
Even after what happened,

35:12.489 --> 35:14.527
people wanted to see it.

35:14.561 --> 35:16.330
Until...

35:16.364 --> 35:19.671
a certain senator's spouse
turned her attention to me.

35:19.704 --> 35:21.541
It's a letter

35:21.575 --> 35:26.150
stating they've agreed
to pull your movie immediately.

35:28.388 --> 35:30.358
Not only that.

35:30.392 --> 35:33.632
They're going to destroy
every print in existence.

35:33.666 --> 35:35.435
You bitch!

35:37.205 --> 35:38.809
‐
‐Somebody stop him!

35:39.878 --> 35:41.480
‐
‐I'm gonna kill you.

35:41.515 --> 35:43.184
I'm gonna kill you!

35:43.217 --> 35:47.192
I won't stop until the whole
world sees my movie!

35:48.896 --> 35:51.334
They charged me with assault.

35:51.367 --> 35:53.237
They put me away for 15 years.

35:53.271 --> 35:55.442
A society
that locks up its artists

35:55.475 --> 35:57.513
doesn't deserve to survive.

35:57.547 --> 35:59.918
It deserves to burn. So,

35:59.951 --> 36:02.924
like a monk,
I spent every minute of my time

36:02.957 --> 36:05.362
gathering every piece
of information I could

36:05.395 --> 36:08.334
to fix and to refine the recipe.

36:09.771 --> 36:11.908
And when I got out, I applied it

36:11.942 --> 36:13.912
to a workprint
that I'd squirreled away.

36:13.946 --> 36:15.750
And the rest...

36:15.783 --> 36:17.352
is history.

36:19.791 --> 36:22.396
Okay. I know
you're angry right now,

36:22.429 --> 36:24.233
but try to appreciate
the big picture.

36:24.266 --> 36:26.270
You were a witness to history.

36:26.303 --> 36:29.376
You can retire
to the lecture circuit.

36:29.410 --> 36:30.913
You'll never have to work
another day.

36:30.946 --> 36:34.521
Take the win
and get on with your lives.

36:34.554 --> 36:37.359
You two look like nice kids.

36:37.392 --> 36:39.263
We saw some of your movie.

36:39.296 --> 36:41.535
The both of us.

36:41.568 --> 36:44.507
Wasn't enough to make us crazy.

36:44.541 --> 36:46.778
But enough to make us do this.

36:50.418 --> 36:51.922
How's that fear center doing?

36:51.955 --> 36:54.359
‐You bitch.
‐Where's the print?

36:54.393 --> 36:56.297
There is no other print,
I told you!

36:56.330 --> 36:58.569
Bullshit!
We were in the projection booth.

36:58.602 --> 37:01.440
I got a look at the print,
and you know what I didn't see?

37:01.474 --> 37:04.279
Splices. Tape splices.

37:04.313 --> 37:07.653
Unless what I had was a copy
and the original

37:07.687 --> 37:10.358
is still here, so fucking talk.

37:11.595 --> 37:12.697
Where is it?

37:12.730 --> 37:15.435
Fuck you.

37:15.468 --> 37:16.938
All right, all right, all right.

37:16.972 --> 37:19.343
It's in the box.
That box there.

37:21.982 --> 37:23.652
Take it and go.
Wait, wait, wait,

37:23.685 --> 37:25.422
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
what are you doing?

37:25.455 --> 37:27.459
Don't! Don't.
That's my life's work.

37:27.492 --> 37:30.533
It's all that I have.
Please, please, please.

37:30.566 --> 37:31.701
Okay.

37:31.735 --> 37:33.539
I'm sorry. All right?
I'm sorry for everything!

37:33.572 --> 37:36.678
Just please, make him stop.

37:36.711 --> 37:38.381
I hate apologies.

37:41.521 --> 37:43.291
It's a thing.

37:44.460 --> 37:47.499
No. Wait, you can't
leave me here. Please.

37:47.533 --> 37:49.671
‐Please.
‐You put us in a horror movie.

37:49.704 --> 37:51.908
Now we're just returning
the favor.

37:59.591 --> 38:02.697
You think this is the end
of the movie?

38:04.366 --> 38:06.337
It's only act one!

38:11.882 --> 38:13.652
And the rest

38:13.685 --> 38:16.691
is gonna be fucking epic!

38:17.894 --> 38:19.029
Aah!

38:19.062 --> 38:22.537
My name will go down
in cinema history.

38:22.570 --> 38:24.006
Kubrick! Coppola!

38:24.039 --> 38:25.341
Spielberg!

38:25.375 --> 38:27.980
And Larry fucking Bitterman!

38:31.387 --> 38:33.792
I got a fucking Rolls!

38:33.826 --> 38:35.629
You want to know why?

38:35.663 --> 38:39.369
Ask yourself why!

38:39.403 --> 38:42.042
You won't like
the fucking answer!
