WEBVTT

00:00.086 --> 00:01.686
<i>Previously on "Suits"...</i>

00:01.722 --> 00:03.647
Your execution date
has been set.

00:03.747 --> 00:05.046
- When?
- 30 days.

00:05.082 --> 00:07.015
You said you were
gonna find Maria.

00:07.050 --> 00:08.950
<i>You have one week</i>
<i>to find a witness.</i>

00:08.985 --> 00:11.886
After that, his execution date
is set in stone.

00:11.922 --> 00:14.289
We found the guy who's been
feeding Sutter his information.

00:14.324 --> 00:15.256
Phillip Allen.
I know.

00:15.292 --> 00:16.703
He came by to cut a deal
two hours ago,

00:16.727 --> 00:17.754
so I gave him one.

00:17.755 --> 00:19.755
- No you goddamn didn't.
- Relax.

00:19.791 --> 00:21.702
As far as the SEC is concerned,
Mike lead directly

00:21.726 --> 00:23.370
to the witness who's gonna put
that piece of shit away

00:23.394 --> 00:24.693
for the rest of his life.

00:24.729 --> 00:26.962
You have a small window
to come clean with the SEC

00:26.998 --> 00:27.998
and save yourself.

00:28.032 --> 00:29.410
I would never turn
on my own father.

00:29.434 --> 00:31.245
I didn't take this deal
for that son of a bitch.

00:31.269 --> 00:32.567
I took it for my wife.

00:32.603 --> 00:35.171
And if you ever contact her
again without my blessing,

00:35.206 --> 00:37.606
I swear to God, I will
beat the shit out of you.

00:37.842 --> 00:40.109
Jim Rogers found
your missing witness.

00:40.144 --> 00:42.044
She died three years ago.

00:42.079 --> 00:43.512
You're informing on
your roommate.

00:43.547 --> 00:45.814
I know it, and if you don't
get me out of here soon,

00:45.850 --> 00:47.750
your bunkmate's gonna
know it, too.

00:47.785 --> 00:48.917
<i>They pulled Mike's deal.</i>

00:48.953 --> 00:50.719
Goddamn it,
I drove that guy to you!

00:50.755 --> 00:52.733
If I tell them that,
they're gonna know what we did.

00:52.757 --> 00:54.023
Sean, please,
there's got to be

00:54.058 --> 00:55.298
another way
to make this happen.

00:55.646 --> 00:57.446
<i>I'm sorry, Harvey,</i>
<i>there isn't.</i>

01:02.686 --> 01:04.197
Jessica, can I talk to you
for a second?

01:04.221 --> 01:05.420
Harvey, can it wait?

01:05.456 --> 01:07.300
I just got some bad news
about our death row case.

01:07.324 --> 01:08.610
No, it can't.

01:08.611 --> 01:10.978
Cahill just pulled Mike's deal.
What?

01:11.013 --> 01:12.446
I thought he was
a man of his word.

01:12.481 --> 01:13.714
He's saying
it wasn't him.

01:13.749 --> 01:15.916
It was his superiors, but what
difference does it make?

01:15.952 --> 01:17.552
It makes all the difference
in the world,

01:17.587 --> 01:19.620
because if it's him,
you can go over his head.

01:19.655 --> 01:21.055
I go over his head,
everybody knows

01:21.090 --> 01:22.556
we're in on
this thing together.

01:22.592 --> 01:24.536
So what you're telling me is,
not only are they pulling

01:24.560 --> 01:27.061
Mike's deal, but you're going to
lose this case for nothing?

01:27.096 --> 01:28.362
Yeah.

01:28.397 --> 01:29.775
I guess that's what
I'm telling you.

01:29.799 --> 01:31.832
Then you're not gonna like
what I have to say.

01:33.936 --> 01:35.914
But if Mike's not getting out,
you might as well win.

01:35.938 --> 01:37.404
What?

01:37.440 --> 01:39.218
Harvey, we're in the middle of
building ourselves back up.

01:39.242 --> 01:40.819
You lose this case,
we take it in the knee.

01:40.843 --> 01:43.611
- Jessica, the guy is guilty.
- And you're his goddamn lawyer.

01:43.646 --> 01:44.845
And you took this case.

01:44.880 --> 01:46.558
And I never would have
taken it if it wasn't

01:46.582 --> 01:47.514
to get Mike out.

01:47.550 --> 01:48.983
Well, you did take it.

01:49.018 --> 01:51.029
And if it's just gonna kick us
back down the mountain,

01:51.053 --> 01:53.320
then I don't care
what it takes.

01:53.356 --> 01:54.922
You win that goddamn case.

02:01.163 --> 02:02.963
<i>We're gathered to hear</i>
<i>the United States</i>

02:02.999 --> 02:07.101
<i>versus William Sutter on</i>
<i>the charges of insider trading.</i>

02:07.136 --> 02:10.339
Is the prosecution prepared to
deliver its opening statement?

02:10.439 --> 02:11.872
We are, Your Honor.

02:14.677 --> 02:16.143
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

02:16.178 --> 02:20.080
William Sutter has been earning
outrageous returns for decades.

02:20.115 --> 02:21.726
Now, I'm sure the defense is
going to try to

02:21.750 --> 02:23.884
convince you Mr. Sutter
trades with his gut

02:23.919 --> 02:26.486
or his instinct or some
mysterious explanation

02:26.522 --> 02:29.923
that is impossible to verify.

02:29.959 --> 02:32.159
But that isn't how
he makes his money.

02:32.194 --> 02:33.727
And we can prove it.

02:34.234 --> 02:36.301
We have a witness that can
document giving

02:36.336 --> 02:38.603
inside information to
William Sutter time

02:38.639 --> 02:40.605
and time again
over the last ten years.

02:40.641 --> 02:42.874
And when we present
that witness to you,

02:42.910 --> 02:44.810
you'll be leaping out of
your chair to convict

02:44.845 --> 02:47.045
that man beyond
a reasonable doubt.

02:47.081 --> 02:48.213
Mr. Specter.

02:48.248 --> 02:49.948
What the hell witness
is he talking about?

02:49.983 --> 02:51.483
Didn't it have to be
in discovery?

02:51.518 --> 02:52.717
It sure as hell did.

02:52.753 --> 02:54.352
What're you
gonna do about it?

02:54.388 --> 02:55.987
I'm gonna stop it
dead in its tracks.

02:56.023 --> 02:58.123
Mr. Specter, is the defense
ready to deliver

02:58.158 --> 02:59.291
its opening statement?

02:59.534 --> 03:02.101
No, Your Honor, but we are
ready to request

03:02.137 --> 03:04.871
an immediate three-day delay
of these proceedings.

03:04.906 --> 03:05.938
On what grounds?

03:05.974 --> 03:07.473
The prosecution
knows what grounds,

03:07.509 --> 03:09.409
because he just violated
the rules of discovery.

03:09.444 --> 03:11.884
Your Honor, I have absolutely
no idea what he's talking about.

03:11.913 --> 03:14.047
Yes, you do because you just
introduced a witness

03:14.082 --> 03:15.882
into your opening
statement and this is

03:15.917 --> 03:17.117
the first
I'm hearing about it.

03:17.152 --> 03:18.651
It's the first you're hearing
about it

03:18.687 --> 03:20.687
because the witness just came
forward yesterday.

03:20.722 --> 03:22.655
I'm sorry,
did the Internet go down?

03:22.691 --> 03:24.869
Did you go over the limit on
your friends and family plan?

03:24.893 --> 03:27.260
Because we're required
to be notified

03:27.295 --> 03:29.295
and I don't even know
what this person's name is.

03:29.331 --> 03:31.130
His name is Phillip Allen
and he's prepared

03:31.166 --> 03:33.432
to put that man behind bars
where he belongs.

03:33.710 --> 03:35.042
Mr. Cahill, that's enough.

03:35.078 --> 03:38.054
Your Honor, we need three days
to depose this witness.

03:38.056 --> 03:39.656
This is ridiculous.

03:39.691 --> 03:42.003
They've lost, they know it, and
they're just trying to stall.

03:42.027 --> 03:43.738
Then you should have thought
of that before you decided

03:43.762 --> 03:46.529
to drop this bomb
in my courtroom.

03:46.565 --> 03:48.565
Mr. Specter,
you have three days.

03:53.405 --> 03:56.573
I wasn't expecting you
so soon.

03:56.609 --> 03:59.309
We have some news
we wanted to give you in person.

03:59.345 --> 04:00.878
We found Maria Gomez.

04:00.913 --> 04:03.480
Leonard, she died
three years ago.

04:04.483 --> 04:05.883
What does that mean?

04:05.918 --> 04:08.585
It means that we have five
more days to find

04:08.621 --> 04:10.787
something we can use
to get your case re-opened.

04:10.823 --> 04:12.856
That sounds like a polite way
of telling me

04:12.892 --> 04:14.958
that in 30 days, I'm gone.

04:14.994 --> 04:17.661
And what if there was a way to
get us more than five days?

04:17.696 --> 04:18.728
Let's take it.

04:18.764 --> 04:20.630
You have the right
to have a family member

04:20.666 --> 04:22.099
present at your execution.

04:22.134 --> 04:25.068
If you have a relative
that's sick, who needs time

04:25.104 --> 04:27.971
to get better to travel,
we can petition the court

04:28.007 --> 04:30.908
for a delay
and they have to grant it.

04:30.943 --> 04:33.110
The woman who raised me,
my Aunt Harriet.

04:33.145 --> 04:34.912
She has MS.

04:34.947 --> 04:38.048
But that's not gonna
do us any good,

04:38.083 --> 04:40.284
because she doesn't want
anything to do with me.

04:40.319 --> 04:41.785
She never came to visit you?

04:41.820 --> 04:43.453
She thinks I'm guilty.

04:43.489 --> 04:45.422
Says I brought shame
on the family.

04:45.457 --> 04:47.191
Even if you did,
you need her now.

04:47.226 --> 04:48.392
She has to see that.

04:48.427 --> 04:51.128
I reached out to her, Rachel,
a thousand times

04:51.163 --> 04:52.429
my first years here.

04:52.464 --> 04:55.032
I wrote her that there's
nothing I needed more

04:55.067 --> 04:57.134
than to know that
I had her support.

04:57.169 --> 04:59.903
She didn't give it to me then,
and...

04:59.939 --> 05:02.039
she's not gonna
give it to me now.

05:02.074 --> 05:04.575
Well, maybe if she could see
that two women like us

05:04.610 --> 05:08.779
believe in you, then she'll
be able to believe in you, too.

05:08.814 --> 05:11.548
If you can make that happen,
that would mean the world to me.

05:11.584 --> 05:12.916
Then we'll make that happen.

05:15.487 --> 05:16.987
That was nice work in there.

05:17.022 --> 05:18.855
Think it was good enough
to get us a mistrial?

05:18.891 --> 05:21.058
Mistrial? You're lucky they
didn't find you

05:21.093 --> 05:22.192
guilty after that.

05:22.228 --> 05:24.328
What the hell
are you talking about?

05:24.363 --> 05:25.829
Enough bullshit, William.

05:25.864 --> 05:28.565
This isn't the SEC asking
anymore, this is me.

05:28.601 --> 05:30.378
Who the hell is Phillip Allen
and what the hell

05:30.402 --> 05:31.602
is he gonna tell them?

05:31.637 --> 05:33.737
He's an investment banker,
used to work for me.

05:33.772 --> 05:35.217
He's not gonna tell them
shit about me

05:35.241 --> 05:36.740
because he doesn't know
shit about me.

05:36.775 --> 05:39.977
Then why were you so surprised
when they said they had him?

05:40.012 --> 05:41.745
Because he can tell them
about my daughter.

05:41.780 --> 05:42.746
I get it.

05:42.781 --> 05:45.349
He gives inside
information to her,

05:45.384 --> 05:49.319
so if this goes down,
she goes down instead of you.

05:49.355 --> 05:50.887
No one's going down.

05:50.923 --> 05:53.190
'Cause they can't prove
she told me what he told her.

05:53.225 --> 05:55.592
Which means, if you do
your job, we both get off.

05:55.628 --> 05:57.294
William, you're taking
a huge risk.

05:57.329 --> 05:59.574
What the hell you think I
hired a gunslinger like you for?

05:59.598 --> 06:02.466
So stop telling me I can't win
and go ahead and start winning.

Oh, I bet you are.

Mike here's an excellent

07:30.407 --> 07:32.007
- What do you want?
- Nothing.

07:32.042 --> 07:34.443
It's just nice to see you guys
are such good friends.

07:34.478 --> 07:36.278
Nice to know
you can trust each other.

07:36.313 --> 07:38.191
I only wish I could trust that
Mike here was really

07:38.215 --> 07:39.593
working on getting me
out on parole.

07:39.617 --> 07:40.682
We are working on it.

07:40.718 --> 07:42.150
Well, you're running

07:42.186 --> 07:44.753
- Would you listen to me, Gallo?
- No, there's no listening!

You got until 6:00 tonight
to get Harvey down here

07:47.258 --> 07:48.824
or after that,
I'm gonna schedule

08:00.474 --> 08:02.941
- Can I help you?
- I hope so.

08:02.976 --> 08:04.476
My name's Rachel Zane.

08:04.511 --> 08:07.512
And I'm a lawyer working on
your nephew's case.

08:07.547 --> 08:09.881
My nephew's case was over
a long time ago.

08:09.916 --> 08:13.151
And thank God for that.
Ma'am.

08:13.186 --> 08:16.054
I'm here because we believe
Leonard was wrongly convicted

08:16.089 --> 08:17.355
of those murders.

08:17.390 --> 08:19.691
Well, that's what
they all say, isn't it?

08:19.726 --> 08:21.526
But just because he suckered
you, doesn't mean

08:21.561 --> 08:22.494
he's gonna sucker me.

08:22.529 --> 08:24.195
He didn't sucker anyone.

08:24.231 --> 08:26.764
I looked at the evidence
and I got to know the man.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.633
So you got proof
he didn't do it?

08:28.668 --> 08:29.968
We're working on it.

08:30.003 --> 08:35.006
But if we can't find a way to
push back the execution,

08:35.041 --> 08:38.443
then in 30 days
it won't matter anymore.

08:39.025 --> 08:40.058
What do you want from me?

08:40.092 --> 08:42.559
I want you to
ask the court for a delay

08:42.595 --> 08:44.695
so you can be with him
at his execution.

08:44.731 --> 08:46.931
I'm not gonna
watch him die.

08:46.966 --> 08:48.699
Ms. Deon, please.

08:48.735 --> 08:49.934
You raised him.

08:49.969 --> 08:53.671
I raised Leonard from
when he was 14 to 17.

08:53.706 --> 08:56.507
I took him in,
I loved him,

08:56.543 --> 08:59.610
He was no good then
and he's no good now.

08:59.646 --> 09:01.424
Well, if that's the case,
you don't have to be

09:01.448 --> 09:02.747
at the execution.

09:02.782 --> 09:04.515
But if you could sign
this request that says

09:04.551 --> 09:06.384
you're too infirm
to travel this month,

09:06.419 --> 09:09.020
it will at least give him
the chance to prove you wrong.

09:12.576 --> 09:15.544
I'll sign your letter.

09:15.579 --> 09:16.978
But I'm not
watching him die.

09:19.450 --> 09:20.816
Thank you.

09:25.365 --> 09:26.431
There you are.

09:26.467 --> 09:28.107
I've been on pins
and needles all morning.

09:28.135 --> 09:29.367
How was dinner?

09:29.403 --> 09:31.147
It was a complete
and total shit show, Donna.

09:31.171 --> 09:32.237
Louis, what happened?

09:32.272 --> 09:33.839
What happened was,
I found out the woman

09:33.874 --> 09:35.640
of my dreams is spoken for.

09:35.676 --> 09:38.043
- She's married?
- She might as well be.

09:38.078 --> 09:42.247
She has this long-term boyfriend
who lives in California

09:42.282 --> 09:45.250
and they have this arrangement
where they see other people.

09:45.285 --> 09:47.886
And even though it was the most
wonderful night of my life,

09:47.921 --> 09:48.887
I'm moving on.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.255
I don't understand.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.768
The most wonderful
night of your life?

09:51.792 --> 09:53.232
Why did you even
stay through dinner?

09:53.260 --> 09:55.500
Because she gave me some line
about being the only person

09:55.529 --> 09:57.195
she'd ever done this with.

09:57.231 --> 09:58.630
But now that I think about it,

09:58.665 --> 10:00.832
what the hell difference
does that make?

10:00.868 --> 10:03.702
Huh.

10:03.737 --> 10:05.648
I think it makes
all the difference in the world.

10:05.672 --> 10:06.938
What're you talking about?

10:06.974 --> 10:08.814
Louis, if you're really
the only man she's ever

10:08.842 --> 10:10.882
done this with, then that means
you've got something

10:10.911 --> 10:11.877
that this other man
doesn't have.

10:11.912 --> 10:12.912
How could you know that?

10:12.946 --> 10:14.023
They've been together
three years.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.580
I can't compete with that.

10:15.616 --> 10:17.460
Because when you're happy, you
don't go looking somewhere else.

10:17.484 --> 10:18.517
Donna--

10:18.552 --> 10:19.929
Louis, I told you I broke up
with Mitchell,

10:19.953 --> 10:21.253
but I didn't tell you why.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.554
He wanted to see
other people.

10:22.589 --> 10:25.290
He wanted to
move in with me.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.604
And when he asked me, I started
picturing a life with him.

10:27.628 --> 10:31.296
And that's when I knew
he wasn't the right one for me.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.899
How can I know
I'm the one for her?

10:33.934 --> 10:37.569
You can't.

10:37.604 --> 10:39.805
But you'll never know
if you don't fight for her.

10:48.202 --> 10:49.367
Harvey Specter's office.

10:49.403 --> 10:51.770
<i>You have a call from</i>
<i>Danbury Federal Prison.</i>

10:51.804 --> 10:53.337
<i>Do you accept--</i>
Yes.

10:53.372 --> 10:54.817
<i>Donna, it's me,</i>
<i>I need to talk to him.</i>

10:54.841 --> 10:56.152
I don't have him, Mike,
he's in court.

10:56.176 --> 10:57.709
I don't care where he is.

10:57.744 --> 11:00.022
I need to know what's going on
with Gallo's parole hearing.

11:00.046 --> 11:01.378
<i>Nothing's going on.</i>

11:01.415 --> 11:03.255
What the hell do you mean
"nothing's going on"?

11:03.282 --> 11:05.294
Harvey was hoping that you
were gonna be out of there

11:05.318 --> 11:06.695
before he had to
go through with it.

11:06.719 --> 11:07.651
<i>Goddamn it, Donna,</i>

11:07.687 --> 11:09.019
Gallo knows about
me and Cahill.

11:09.055 --> 11:10.866
If he doesn't see some progress
by the end of the day,

11:10.890 --> 11:12.223
he's gonna tell Kevin.

11:12.258 --> 11:16.660
Mike, Harvey didn't want you
to know this yet, but...

11:16.696 --> 11:18.496
there is no you and Cahill.

11:18.531 --> 11:21.532
- What?
<i>- Cahill pulled your deal.</i>

11:21.567 --> 11:23.067
What the hell
are you talking about?

11:23.102 --> 11:25.836
His superiors said you didn't
hold up your end of the bargain.

11:25.872 --> 11:27.271
That is bullshit!

11:27.306 --> 11:29.673
I've been busting my ass to hold
up my end of the bargain.

11:29.709 --> 11:31.275
I know that
and Harvey knows that,

11:31.310 --> 11:32.810
and he's trying to
get your deal back.

11:32.845 --> 11:34.812
<i>Well, you tell him that</i>
<i>while he's getting around</i>

11:34.847 --> 11:36.680
to making Cahill honor his
goddamn word,

11:36.716 --> 11:39.116
maybe he could take just
a minute to honor his word

11:39.151 --> 11:41.652
and get Gallo
his goddamn parole hearing.

11:45.212 --> 11:46.878
- I got it.
- She signed it?

11:46.913 --> 11:49.047
She did, and an affidavit
from her doctor, too.

11:49.082 --> 11:51.382
All right, I'll go to court
and make this happen.

11:51.418 --> 11:53.396
You start going back through
every piece of evidence we have

11:53.420 --> 11:54.664
because this gives us
some breathing room

11:54.688 --> 11:56.654
to find something,
but we have to deliver.

11:56.690 --> 11:57.789
- Jessica...
- Look, Rachel,

11:57.824 --> 11:58.790
I know you want
to go to court with me,

11:58.825 --> 11:59.991
but we don't have the time--

12:00.026 --> 12:01.537
- No, that's not it.
- Well, then what is it?

12:01.561 --> 12:03.528
She signed
the request, but...

12:03.563 --> 12:05.730
she wouldn't actually agree to
be there with him if--

12:05.765 --> 12:07.065
Rachel.

12:07.100 --> 12:09.500
It's not our job to
reunite him with his family

12:09.536 --> 12:11.436
if it comes to it.

12:11.471 --> 12:14.439
It is our job to make sure
it doesn't come to it.

12:14.474 --> 12:17.108
I meant she doesn't
want to come

12:17.143 --> 12:18.743
because she thinks
that he did it.

12:18.778 --> 12:22.280
And if we can't convince his own
aunt that he's innocent,

12:22.315 --> 12:24.716
how are we gonna convince
12 strangers?

12:24.751 --> 12:27.352
Right now, I'd rather
focus on the fact that

12:27.387 --> 12:30.955
we're getting the man another
30 days to save his life.

12:46.498 --> 12:47.731
Mike, sit down.

12:47.766 --> 12:48.766
I need to talk to you.

12:48.800 --> 12:50.333
You needed to
talk to me yesterday

12:50.369 --> 12:52.102
when Cahill decided
to pull my deal.

12:52.137 --> 12:54.137
He's saying it was
the people above him.

12:54.173 --> 12:55.583
And I didn't want to
tell you about it

12:55.607 --> 12:57.085
until I figured out
how to get it back.

12:57.109 --> 12:58.620
Yeah, well the amount of
things you're not telling me

12:58.644 --> 12:59.876
are really starting
to pile up.

12:59.912 --> 13:01.378
I know you found out
about Gallo.

13:01.413 --> 13:02.612
I'm sorry.

13:02.648 --> 13:04.526
But I give you my word,
it's being taken care of.

13:04.550 --> 13:05.515
Oh, like my deal was being
taken care of?

13:05.551 --> 13:06.783
Listen to me.

13:06.818 --> 13:08.858
I'm gonna neutralize
Phillip Allen so you still have

13:08.887 --> 13:10.287
a chance to walk out of here.

13:10.322 --> 13:12.789
But that's not gonna happen
if you don't get Jill Miller

13:12.824 --> 13:14.191
to testify against her father.

13:14.226 --> 13:16.092
Goddamn it, Harvey,
I've been down that road.

13:16.128 --> 13:17.939
Jill's not gonna go for it
and neither is Kevin.

13:17.963 --> 13:19.941
Well, then you better
figure out a way to make him,

13:19.965 --> 13:22.299
because once I blow
Phillip Allen out of the water,

13:22.334 --> 13:26.102
the next person up on Cahill's
hit list is Kevin's wife.

13:34.227 --> 13:35.159
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hey, Tara.

13:35.195 --> 13:36.527
It's me, Louis Litt.

13:36.563 --> 13:38.596
I know who you are, Louis,
you don't have to use

13:38.632 --> 13:39.831
your last name.

13:39.866 --> 13:41.466
Well, I don't like
to be presumptuous.

13:41.501 --> 13:44.035
I mean, you can have
another man--I mean--

13:44.070 --> 13:45.837
you can have another Louis
in your life.

13:45.872 --> 13:48.006
<i>Speaking of other men, Louis.</i>

13:48.041 --> 13:50.408
I'm glad you called back.

13:50.443 --> 13:51.887
I had an amazing time
the other night,

13:51.911 --> 13:54.078
but I wasn't sure
you were okay

13:54.114 --> 13:56.581
with what I told you
about me having a--

13:56.616 --> 13:58.316
<i>Oh, please, Tara, it's 2016.</i>

13:58.351 --> 14:00.885
If a man can't be okay with
his woman seeing other men,

14:00.920 --> 14:04.022
then what was Susan B. Anthony
even fighting for?

14:05.792 --> 14:08.660
Well in that case,
Louis Litt,

14:08.695 --> 14:10.161
how'd you like to
go out tonight?

14:10.196 --> 14:11.362
Tonight?

14:12.932 --> 14:14.565
Um, I'd love to.

14:14.601 --> 14:16.445
Then tell me where to be,
and I'll meet you there

14:16.469 --> 14:18.603
<i>at 7:00 p.m. sharp.</i>

14:19.274 --> 14:20.573
Okay.

14:24.880 --> 14:27.614
Jessica Pearson in court.

14:27.649 --> 14:30.784
I haven't seen that
in a while.

14:30.819 --> 14:33.553
I like to get back in the ring
from time to time.

14:33.588 --> 14:36.189
So what giant companies
are you merging today?

14:36.224 --> 14:37.824
Behemoth Steel
and Global Everything?

14:37.859 --> 14:39.526
That was Tuesday.

14:39.561 --> 14:42.195
Today, I am here to save
a man's life.

14:42.230 --> 14:43.763
We took over an
Innocence Project case.

14:43.799 --> 14:45.298
Innocence Project?

14:45.334 --> 14:47.767
So what're you trying to do,
rehabilitate your firm's image?

14:47.803 --> 14:50.337
What I'm trying to do
is help a man get justice.

14:50.372 --> 14:54.074
And if doing that helps my firm
look good, even better.

14:54.109 --> 14:56.309
Fair enough.

14:56.345 --> 14:58.545
How have you been, Jeff?

14:58.580 --> 14:59.713
I've been good.

14:59.748 --> 15:02.582
Listen, I know we talked about
me looking you up

15:02.617 --> 15:06.052
when this whole mess
was over, but...

15:06.088 --> 15:09.322
I want you to know--
It's okay, Jessica.

15:09.358 --> 15:11.324
I understand.

15:11.360 --> 15:13.360
No.

15:13.395 --> 15:16.262
What I mean is,
it's not over.

15:16.298 --> 15:18.698
I'm still in it.

15:18.734 --> 15:21.234
You really are fighting to
rehabilitate your image,

15:21.269 --> 15:22.669
aren't you?

15:22.704 --> 15:25.238
I am.

15:25.273 --> 15:27.340
It was good to see you,
Jessica.

15:27.376 --> 15:29.109
It's good to see you too,
Jeff.

15:38.494 --> 15:40.127
What're you doing here, Sean?

15:40.162 --> 15:41.595
I'm here to protect
my star witness.

15:41.631 --> 15:42.641
He's got his own
attorney for that.

15:42.665 --> 15:43.931
I don't care.

15:43.966 --> 15:45.677
And we're here for you
to get your discovery,

15:45.701 --> 15:46.834
not lecture me
on procedure.

15:46.869 --> 15:48.569
I'm here to demonstrate
how Mr. Allen's

15:48.604 --> 15:51.572
cross examination's gonna go,
now sit the hell down.

15:53.643 --> 15:56.110
Mr. Allen, what exactly
are you getting in return

15:56.145 --> 15:57.711
for your testimony
against my client?

15:57.747 --> 15:59.747
He's getting immunity for
the crimes he committed.

15:59.782 --> 16:01.727
Are you gonna answer for him
when he's on the stand, too?

16:01.751 --> 16:02.883
What were those crimes?

16:02.919 --> 16:04.952
I gave William Sutter
inside information

16:04.987 --> 16:06.120
over the course of a decade.

16:06.155 --> 16:07.488
And how, exactly,
did you do that?

16:07.523 --> 16:10.090
When my bank was hired to
review a transaction

16:10.126 --> 16:11.926
and I determined
it was going through,

16:11.961 --> 16:13.794
I'd call Jill Miller
and I'd give her

16:13.829 --> 16:15.329
the relevant names
of the parties.

16:15.889 --> 16:17.823
Jill Miller?
I'm confused.

16:17.858 --> 16:20.125
You told the SEC that you were
feeding William Sutter

16:20.160 --> 16:21.359
inside information.

16:21.395 --> 16:23.595
- We had an understanding.
- Understood by who?

16:23.630 --> 16:24.896
William Sutter.

16:24.932 --> 16:27.265
Did you ever have a specific
conversation with Mr. Sutter?

16:27.301 --> 16:28.912
I mean, when was the last time
you were even

16:28.936 --> 16:30.702
in the same room?

16:30.737 --> 16:32.938
Jill said
that he understood.

16:32.973 --> 16:35.841
Bullshit, you can't testify
William understood anything.

16:35.876 --> 16:37.809
It's called hearsay.
It's called the truth.

16:37.845 --> 16:39.444
I don't give a shit
what you call it,

16:39.480 --> 16:42.647
if you don't have proof,
the jury can never hear it.

16:42.683 --> 16:45.517
Do you have proof?

16:45.703 --> 16:47.281
Oh, I don't believe this,
you don't have a paper trail.

16:47.305 --> 16:49.639
- I have the phone records.
- I mean to Sutter.

16:49.674 --> 16:51.307
She's his
goddamn daughter!

16:51.342 --> 16:53.109
Yeah, and every murderer
has a father, too,

16:53.144 --> 16:54.288
doesn't mean they're
in on the crime.

16:54.312 --> 16:55.589
Save your metaphors
for the trial, Harvey.

16:55.613 --> 16:56.746
We don't need them here.

16:56.781 --> 16:58.292
I don't need to save anything
for trial

16:58.316 --> 17:00.650
because you made a deal with
this man for nothing,

17:00.685 --> 17:04.153
you handed me my best witness,
and this deposition's over.

17:08.992 --> 17:10.826
You son of a bitch.
How dare you?

17:10.862 --> 17:11.993
How dare I what, Sean?

17:12.030 --> 17:13.429
Defend my own client?

17:13.464 --> 17:15.108
Bullshit, you weren't trying
to defend your client.

17:15.133 --> 17:16.276
You were trying to ruin my case

17:16.300 --> 17:17.733
'cause you're
pissed off about Mike.

17:17.769 --> 17:18.733
I sure as hell am.

17:18.770 --> 17:20.636
We had a deal
and you broke it.

17:20.672 --> 17:23.339
So now I'm breaking it, too.
Well, you know what, Harvey?

17:23.374 --> 17:25.519
I don't care what you're
breaking, 'cause Phillip Allen

17:25.542 --> 17:28.377
gets me the daughter and that
gets me right back to Sutter.

17:28.413 --> 17:31.047
Good, 'cause that's exactly
what I'd expect you to do.

17:35.041 --> 17:36.240
Oh, I get it.

17:36.276 --> 17:37.742
You weren't trying to
win this thing.

17:37.777 --> 17:39.944
You just wanted to discredit
Phillip Allen so I'd have

17:39.980 --> 17:42.046
no choice but to
reinstate Mike's deal.

17:42.082 --> 17:43.948
You're damn right
that's what I wanted.

17:43.984 --> 17:46.295
So instead of getting mad at me
for doing what you should have

17:46.319 --> 17:48.431
done in the first place,
why don't you start turning up

17:48.455 --> 17:50.888
the heat so Mike can get
this goddamn woman

17:50.924 --> 17:52.290
to turn on her father?

17:59.032 --> 18:00.309
- Kevin.
- Oh, good, you're here.

18:00.333 --> 18:01.566
You can help.

18:01.601 --> 18:03.420
I know you made me promise
not to bring this up again--

18:03.421 --> 18:05.221
- Mike, I told you--
- Listen to me.

18:05.256 --> 18:06.756
I just talked to Harvey.

18:06.791 --> 18:09.003
A man named Phillip Allen has
come forward and he's gonna--

18:09.027 --> 18:10.326
Wait, you talked to Harvey?

18:10.362 --> 18:11.994
Listen, this guy
cut a deal with Cahill.

18:12.030 --> 18:14.530
All right? That means
he knows all about it.

18:14.566 --> 18:15.631
What do you want from me?

18:15.667 --> 18:18.067
I want you to convince her
that this is it.

18:18.103 --> 18:19.847
She has a one-time chance
of getting immunity

18:19.871 --> 18:21.471
if she turns on
her father now.

18:21.506 --> 18:23.684
How the hell do you even know
this Cahill guy'll do that?

18:23.708 --> 18:25.274
Because I know how bad
he wants Sutter,

18:25.310 --> 18:27.555
and offering Jill a deal is the
best way to make that happen.

18:27.579 --> 18:30.079
Or he promises her a deal,
then takes it away.

18:30.115 --> 18:31.625
And no one's kissing my kids
good night

18:31.649 --> 18:32.649
for the next two years.

18:32.684 --> 18:34.050
Harvey wouldn't
let that happen.

18:34.085 --> 18:35.318
He's William's lawyer.

18:35.353 --> 18:36.731
He's not selling out
his own client.

18:36.755 --> 18:37.954
You're his client, too.

18:37.989 --> 18:39.633
Only to protect the guy
who's paying his bills.

18:39.657 --> 18:40.868
He doesn't give
a shit about me.

18:40.892 --> 18:44.093
Maybe not, but he does
give a shit about me!

18:44.129 --> 18:45.461
What're you--
what're you saying?

18:46.898 --> 18:48.331
I'm saying that
offering Jill a deal

18:48.366 --> 18:49.732
doesn't just get
her out of prison.

18:49.768 --> 18:50.733
It gets me out, too.

18:51.870 --> 18:53.770
You've been
informing on me, Mike?

18:53.805 --> 18:56.439
Yes.

18:56.474 --> 18:58.619
Get the hell out of my sight,
you traitor piece of shit.

18:58.643 --> 19:00.276
Kevin, listen,
I'm only telling you this

19:00.311 --> 19:01.377
so that you'll see--

19:01.413 --> 19:02.812
See what?
How full of shit you are?

19:02.847 --> 19:04.492
Telling me you grew up
without a mom and dad

19:04.516 --> 19:05.481
just to gain my trust--

19:05.517 --> 19:06.649
That is not why I did that.

19:06.684 --> 19:08.429
And I just told you the truth
so that you trust

19:08.453 --> 19:09.685
that I care about you.

19:09.721 --> 19:11.621
Bullshit, 'cause here you are,
willing to leave

19:11.656 --> 19:14.490
two little kids all alone just
to get your goddamn freedom.

19:14.526 --> 19:15.936
- Kevin, I'm sorry--
- No, you're not.

19:15.960 --> 19:16.993
But you're about to be.

19:18.096 --> 19:19.896
Come on, fight!
Fight back, you traitor!

19:19.931 --> 19:21.764
Fight me back!
You have to listen to me!

19:21.800 --> 19:22.765
Come on, fight!

19:35.246 --> 19:37.747
- This isn't done, Mike!
- Get him out of here now!

19:37.782 --> 19:39.415
- No, no, no--
- Get him to solitary now!

19:39.451 --> 19:41.517
No, not solitary!
It's my fault, it's my fault!

19:41.553 --> 19:44.387
You don't have to do this!
Ross, Ross!

19:44.422 --> 19:47.256
Another word, and you're
going to solitary, too.

19:59.636 --> 20:00.835
Harvey Specter.

20:00.870 --> 20:03.004
<i>You have a call from</i>
<i>Danbury Federal Prison.</i>

20:03.039 --> 20:04.079
<i>Do you accept the charges?</i>

20:04.107 --> 20:05.072
- Yes.
- Harvey.

20:05.108 --> 20:06.374
<i>Mike, good.</i>

20:06.409 --> 20:08.187
<i>I did my part and I took</i>
<i>care of Phillip Allen.</i>

20:08.211 --> 20:10.444
Tell me you did yours and got
Kevin to talk to his wife.

20:10.480 --> 20:11.445
<i>I tried.</i>

20:11.481 --> 20:12.847
Instead, I got him
put in solitary.

20:12.882 --> 20:14.348
What?
How the hell did that happen?

20:14.384 --> 20:15.683
I told him I was
informing on him

20:15.718 --> 20:17.463
and then he started
beating the shit out of me.

20:17.487 --> 20:19.353
Are you kidding me?
Why would you do that?

20:19.389 --> 20:20.855
Because lying
wasn't getting it done

20:20.890 --> 20:22.434
and I'm living on borrowed time,
so I thought I might as well

20:22.458 --> 20:23.858
tell him, anyway.

20:23.893 --> 20:26.005
Then you better figure out
a way to get him out of there,

20:26.029 --> 20:27.673
because we need to get Jill
to turn on Sutter

20:27.697 --> 20:28.829
before Cahill gets her to.

20:28.865 --> 20:30.031
<i>That's why I'm calling you.</i>

20:30.066 --> 20:31.543
I already have a way,
I just need to know

20:31.567 --> 20:33.412
you did that other thing
you were supposed to do.

20:33.436 --> 20:35.314
I need to know you got Gallo
his parole hearing.

20:38.875 --> 20:41.942
Let's get to it.

20:41.978 --> 20:43.044
What happened?

20:43.079 --> 20:44.011
Good news.

20:44.047 --> 20:45.446
The court granted our motion.

20:45.481 --> 20:47.026
They pushed your execution
back a month.

20:47.050 --> 20:48.916
I don't believe it.

20:48.951 --> 20:51.218
You convinced my aunt
I didn't kill those people?

20:51.254 --> 20:53.654
- No, Leonard, I didn't.
- I don't understand.

20:53.690 --> 20:56.563
You said that she had to agree
to be there for me.

20:56.663 --> 21:00.197
She agreed
to sign the papers.

21:00.233 --> 21:01.866
But she's not gonna come.

21:01.901 --> 21:03.167
Goddamn it.

21:03.202 --> 21:05.069
Leonard, don't take
your eye off the ball.

21:05.104 --> 21:07.371
This was about
buying us time.

21:07.407 --> 21:09.941
Take my eye
off the ball?

21:09.976 --> 21:11.509
Do you even
give a shit about me?

21:11.544 --> 21:12.710
Of course we do.

21:12.745 --> 21:14.679
Yeah, I know you do.

21:14.714 --> 21:17.515
But I want to know
if she cares

21:17.550 --> 21:18.616
whether I live or die.

21:18.651 --> 21:20.484
I just got your execution
pushed back.

21:20.520 --> 21:23.387
That's not
what I asked you.

21:24.490 --> 21:26.390
You didn't even
go see her, did you?

21:26.426 --> 21:29.026
I have a firm to run.

21:29.062 --> 21:31.395
And only one of us
needed to get her signature.

21:31.431 --> 21:34.699
But two of you
could've helped convince her

21:34.734 --> 21:36.567
that I'm innocent.

21:36.602 --> 21:39.036
Don't you get it?

21:39.072 --> 21:42.006
The woman who raised me
wants nothing to do with me.

21:42.041 --> 21:44.075
Leonard, I know you're
disappointed.

21:44.110 --> 21:47.211
But it's not my job to repair
your relationship

21:47.246 --> 21:48.646
with your aunt.

21:48.952 --> 21:50.585
It's my job
to get you out of here.

21:50.621 --> 21:52.187
I ain't never
getting out of here!

21:52.222 --> 21:53.989
Don't you understand that?

21:54.024 --> 21:56.958
So you go play your game
with the courts.

21:56.994 --> 22:00.161
But whether it's
30 days or 60 days,

22:00.197 --> 22:03.365
it doesn't matter, 'cause
I'm gonna die in here, lady.

22:03.400 --> 22:06.601
The one thing I asked you
to do, you didn't.

22:09.886 --> 22:11.652
You didn't even
care enough to try.

22:19.462 --> 22:20.595
Just get out.

22:32.745 --> 22:34.585
You better be here to tell me
I have a hearing.

22:34.613 --> 22:36.213
That's exactly
what I'm here to tell you.

22:36.248 --> 22:37.214
But you're not gonna
have anything

22:37.249 --> 22:38.426
unless you do
something for me.

22:38.450 --> 22:39.850
Bullshit.
Wasn't part of the deal.

22:39.885 --> 22:40.818
I don't give a shit.

22:40.853 --> 22:42.119
I'm tired of you
threatening me,

22:42.154 --> 22:44.455
so if you even want a chance of
getting out of here early,

22:44.456 --> 22:46.823
you're gonna
do something for me.

22:46.858 --> 22:48.391
And by the way,

22:48.426 --> 22:51.094
it's too late to tell Kevin that
I've been informing on him.

22:51.129 --> 22:53.796
I already did.

22:53.832 --> 22:56.899
What do you want?

22:56.935 --> 22:58.551
I need you to get him
out of solitary.

22:58.651 --> 22:59.750
You're kidding me, right?

22:59.785 --> 23:01.151
I can't do that
That's bullshit.

23:01.186 --> 23:02.931
You switched into my cell
the first night and ever since,

23:02.955 --> 23:04.232
you've been bragging about
everything

23:04.256 --> 23:05.834
that you can do in here,
so how about you stop

23:05.858 --> 23:07.124
telling me that
you can't do it,

23:07.159 --> 23:08.959
and just tell me
whether or not you will.

23:13.866 --> 23:16.333
All right, Mikey.

23:16.368 --> 23:19.803
I'll get your ticket to freedom
out of solitary for you.

23:19.838 --> 23:22.539
But if you get out of here
and I don't,

23:22.574 --> 23:25.375
you should know, I can get to
you just as easily out there

23:25.411 --> 23:26.943
as I can in here.

23:26.979 --> 23:31.014
And when I say "get to you,"
you got to remember what I did

23:31.050 --> 23:33.150
to make Harvey put me away
in the first place.

23:48.980 --> 23:51.058
Do you want to talk about
what happened at the prison?

23:51.082 --> 23:52.415
No, Rachel, I don't.

23:52.450 --> 23:54.184
Because whether Leonard
believes me or not,

23:54.219 --> 23:56.286
I really do have a firm to run.
I know you do.

23:56.321 --> 23:57.965
Then you know I have
ten other things to do

23:57.989 --> 23:59.355
before I get out of
here tonight.

23:59.391 --> 24:00.557
Then I will
leave it alone.

24:00.592 --> 24:03.226
But for what it's worth,
you were there for me

24:03.261 --> 24:05.195
when the victim's father
lashed out at me.

24:05.230 --> 24:08.364
And so, if you want to talk
about it with someone,

24:08.400 --> 24:11.234
I just want you to know
that I'm here for you, too.

24:11.269 --> 24:12.936
I appreciate that, Rachel.

24:12.971 --> 24:14.804
But right now, I'd rather you
spend your time

24:14.839 --> 24:17.907
finding something to get
Leonard Bailey out.

24:17.943 --> 24:19.108
I will.

24:38.196 --> 24:39.162
<i>Hello?</i>

24:39.197 --> 24:40.630
Hi, Jeff, it's me.

24:40.665 --> 24:42.543
<i>How would you like to have</i>
<i>dinner with me tonight?</i>

24:42.567 --> 24:44.267
I would love to, Jessica.

24:44.302 --> 24:45.702
Just name the place.

24:53.745 --> 24:55.445
What?

24:55.480 --> 24:56.813
Nothing.

24:56.848 --> 24:59.349
I just haven't been in this
place since I was here with you.

24:59.384 --> 25:01.985
I remembered how much
you liked it.

25:02.020 --> 25:04.487
So how come you decided
to call me?

25:04.522 --> 25:05.755
You said you were
still in it.

25:05.790 --> 25:08.157
You told me once
that you think maybe

25:08.193 --> 25:09.959
things happen for a reason.

25:09.995 --> 25:11.461
You mean
running into me today?

25:11.496 --> 25:13.162
I mean after
I ran into you.

25:13.198 --> 25:14.897
I was pretty much
accused of being cold,

25:14.933 --> 25:17.166
heartless, and uncaring.

25:17.202 --> 25:21.271
And I can take it when it's
lawyers saying that about me.

25:21.306 --> 25:24.340
But this was from the man
whose life I'm trying to save.

25:24.376 --> 25:25.675
And you wanted
to be with someone

25:25.710 --> 25:27.210
who knows a different
side of you.

25:27.245 --> 25:29.379
I thought I wanted to be
with someone who knows

25:29.414 --> 25:31.381
that's not a side
of me at all.

25:31.416 --> 25:34.917
Jessica, I told you
I loved you once.

25:34.953 --> 25:36.786
And when I said that,

25:36.821 --> 25:39.355
I meant that one of the things
that I love about you

25:39.391 --> 25:43.092
is your ability to
push emotion aside

25:43.128 --> 25:45.461
and knock the shit
out of people.

25:45.497 --> 25:48.865
So you think I'm cold,
but you love that about me?

25:48.900 --> 25:52.702
I'm saying that's one of the
things that I love about you.

25:52.737 --> 25:54.537
The other thing is
that in your heart,

25:54.572 --> 25:56.072
you're not cold at all.

25:58.877 --> 26:03.046
What do you say after dinner,
you take me home?

26:03.081 --> 26:05.148
I say...

26:05.183 --> 26:07.417
I think that we should
take it slow this time.

26:22.246 --> 26:23.845
Listen, I know you hate me
right now,

26:23.880 --> 26:27.849
but right this second,
we are on the same side.

26:27.884 --> 26:29.851
I know.

26:29.886 --> 26:31.853
- You do?
- Yeah.

26:31.888 --> 26:33.433
'Cause they just
let me out of solitary,

26:33.457 --> 26:34.990
and I went to call Jill.

26:35.025 --> 26:36.669
I was gonna tell her
everything, but before

26:36.693 --> 26:39.194
I got a chance
to do that...

26:39.229 --> 26:41.162
she told me
she was indicted.

26:41.198 --> 26:43.932
- Kevin, I'm so sorry.
- I don't need sorrys, Mike.

26:43.967 --> 26:46.935
I need to find a way
to keep my wife out of prison.

26:46.970 --> 26:49.104
- Then let me help you.
- You can help me.

26:49.139 --> 26:51.640
But it can't be by trying to get
her to turn on him,

26:51.675 --> 26:53.942
because I'm telling you,
there is no way in hell

26:53.977 --> 26:55.477
she's gonna do that.

26:55.512 --> 26:58.513
You really think she's willing
to go to prison for him, too?

27:00.851 --> 27:03.618
Look, the night I found out
about her and her father,

27:03.654 --> 27:05.487
I asked her how she could have
gotten involved

27:05.522 --> 27:08.023
in something like this.

27:08.058 --> 27:12.294
Turns out, she found out his
whole place was a Ponzi scheme.

27:12.329 --> 27:15.797
She flipped out on him and he
gave her some bullshit sob story

27:15.832 --> 27:18.199
about how the returns
were running dry.

27:18.235 --> 27:20.802
He told her that if she got
inside information for him,

27:20.837 --> 27:25.974
one time, it'd keep them from
losing everything.

27:26.009 --> 27:28.376
And the next thing she knew,
it was too late to stop.

27:28.412 --> 27:29.744
Yeah, he tricked her.

27:29.780 --> 27:32.580
And when I tried
to tell her that,

27:32.616 --> 27:34.649
get her to quit with me,
you know what she said?

27:34.685 --> 27:35.817
She said
she'd never do that.

27:35.852 --> 27:37.563
Because no matter what
he did with the business,

27:37.587 --> 27:41.189
she knew he was willing to run
into a burning building for her.

27:41.224 --> 27:43.124
So she was willing
to do the same for him.

27:45.062 --> 27:48.063
Kevin, I need you to let me
use your cell phone.

27:48.098 --> 27:49.230
I need you to trust me.

27:55.317 --> 27:57.128
<i>- Harvey Specter's office.</i>
- Donna, it's me.

27:57.228 --> 27:58.438
I need your help
and I don't have much time.

27:58.462 --> 27:59.695
What do you need?

27:59.730 --> 28:01.497
<i>I think I have a plan</i>
<i>to get Jill to talk.</i>

28:01.532 --> 28:03.465
Mike, shouldn't you be telling
Harvey about this?

28:03.501 --> 28:04.767
<i>I'm calling him next.</i>

28:04.802 --> 28:06.480
But whatever we do,
we are not gonna be able

28:06.504 --> 28:08.582
to get her to talk unless
you first get her to listen.

28:11.041 --> 28:12.908
Hey Tara,
I know I called four minutes ago

28:12.943 --> 28:15.010
and I know you said
7:00 p.m. sharp,

28:15.045 --> 28:17.346
but now I'm thinking
you said 7:00 p.m. short.

28:17.381 --> 28:19.414
And I don't know exactly
why that would be,

28:19.450 --> 28:23.218
uh, but it's 7:12,
and I'm just wondering what--

28:23.254 --> 28:24.653
Hello?

28:24.688 --> 28:26.321
Goddamn it.

28:26.357 --> 28:27.556
Louis.

28:28.226 --> 28:29.559
I just saw
you called two times.

28:29.594 --> 28:31.277
I'm so sorry I'm late.
Tara, please.

28:31.313 --> 28:32.512
There's no need to apologize.

28:32.547 --> 28:34.292
I had them hold the reservation
for 15 minutes,

28:34.316 --> 28:36.394
and it's only been 13 minutes,
so I'm sure it'll be fine.

28:36.418 --> 28:39.385
Thank you, Louis.

28:40.589 --> 28:42.122
The Litt party is ready.

28:42.157 --> 28:44.502
Awesomeness, I'll have a table
for you as soon as one's ready.

28:44.526 --> 28:45.792
As soon as one's ready?

28:45.827 --> 28:47.705
I asked you to hold our
reservation for 15 minutes

28:47.729 --> 28:49.741
and it's only been 13 minutes,
you hipster douche bag.

28:49.765 --> 28:51.164
Excuse me, sir,
is everything okay?

28:51.199 --> 28:53.211
No, everything is not okay,
this asshole gave away my table.

28:53.235 --> 28:55.275
Hey, man, it's all good.
I'll get you another table.

28:55.303 --> 28:57.137
"Hey, man," it's all bad.

28:57.423 --> 28:59.468
I don't want another table.
I want the one I reserved.

28:59.492 --> 29:00.936
So why don't you tell those
people that you gave them

29:00.960 --> 29:02.493
something that belongs to
someone else,

29:02.528 --> 29:04.695
'cause I'm not going to share
the most exquisite table

29:04.730 --> 29:06.096
on the planet
with another man.

29:06.132 --> 29:07.164
Louis.

29:08.467 --> 29:10.434
This isn't gonna work.

29:10.469 --> 29:12.269
Louis--Louis.
Please talk to me.

29:12.304 --> 29:13.849
Look, I know I said
I'd be okay with this,

29:13.873 --> 29:15.105
but I'm not okay.

29:15.141 --> 29:16.518
Because the whole time
I couldn't reach you,

29:16.542 --> 29:18.120
I kept thinking that you were
on the phone with him

29:18.144 --> 29:19.676
and laughing with him
and loving him.

29:19.712 --> 29:21.089
And as long as you have
another man,

29:21.113 --> 29:22.758
I'm always gonna think that
you're with him,

29:22.782 --> 29:23.782
thinking about him--

29:23.816 --> 29:25.482
- Louis? That's--
- Let me finish.

29:25.518 --> 29:27.851
You are the most riveting
woman I've ever met.

29:27.887 --> 29:29.787
You've cast a spell on me.

29:29.822 --> 29:31.633
And I would never tell you
how to live your life.

29:31.657 --> 29:34.358
But I will not
share you with another man.

29:34.393 --> 29:36.393
And I don't understand
why any man would.

29:36.429 --> 29:41.098
I want you,
and I want all of you.

29:41.133 --> 29:45.069
But if I can't have that--
Louis?

29:45.104 --> 29:46.236
Take me home.

29:54.065 --> 29:56.265
Here, let me
help you with that.

29:56.301 --> 29:57.733
- Oh, would you?
- Of course.

29:57.769 --> 30:00.469
Us redheads have to
stick together.

30:00.505 --> 30:03.172
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, Jill.

30:04.175 --> 30:05.574
Who are you?

30:05.610 --> 30:07.877
I'm the woman who tricked you
into going to Danbury.

30:07.912 --> 30:09.345
I have nothing
to say to you.

30:09.380 --> 30:11.358
Please, I came here in person
because I don't want to

30:11.382 --> 30:12.481
trick you again.

30:12.517 --> 30:13.761
Then say whatever it is
you're here to say.

30:13.785 --> 30:16.652
I'm here to tell you
about my father.

30:16.688 --> 30:18.632
He committed a crime years ago,
and before he did,

30:18.656 --> 30:21.123
he tried to get me to put
my toe in the water with him.

30:21.159 --> 30:23.559
I said no,
but I almost said yes,

30:23.594 --> 30:25.561
because I loved him.

30:25.596 --> 30:27.797
And I knew he was a good man.

30:27.832 --> 30:29.098
What do you want from me?

30:29.133 --> 30:30.933
Same thing that I wanted
the last time.

30:30.969 --> 30:33.202
I want you to visit your husband
in prison tomorrow.

30:33.237 --> 30:35.204
And I want you to
keep an open mind.

30:45.479 --> 30:47.412
Louis, I knew
you were passionate,

30:47.448 --> 30:50.048
but I had no idea
how passionate.

30:50.084 --> 30:52.384
That was magic.

30:52.419 --> 30:53.719
Yeah, I take pride
in my work.

30:53.754 --> 30:57.522
Well, you should.

30:57.558 --> 30:58.902
Well, in that case,
there's another show starting

30:58.926 --> 31:00.659
in about 15 minutes.

31:00.694 --> 31:03.662
Okay, you know
what that means, don't you?

31:07.067 --> 31:09.167
You're gonna be exhausted,

31:09.203 --> 31:13.605
which means you're gonna
have to spend the night.

31:14.137 --> 31:16.315
Well, then what do you say we
make the whole day of it, too?

31:16.339 --> 31:18.005
What exactly do you
have in mind?

31:18.040 --> 31:20.474
There's a dress rehearsal
of the "Barber of Seville"

31:20.510 --> 31:22.143
at the Met tomorrow
and I could get us in

31:22.178 --> 31:24.945
as patrons.

31:24.981 --> 31:26.213
Louis...

31:29.519 --> 31:30.684
I would love to.

31:34.791 --> 31:39.059
- William, we need to talk.
- I'm here, just like you asked.

31:39.095 --> 31:40.761
They indicted your daughter.

31:40.797 --> 31:42.496
I know.
She told me.

31:42.532 --> 31:44.632
And I told you, you were
playing a dangerous game

31:44.667 --> 31:46.066
using her to shield you.

31:46.102 --> 31:47.535
Jill's a big girl.

31:47.570 --> 31:49.203
She can take care
of herself.

31:49.238 --> 31:51.438
Take care of herself,
or take care of you?

31:51.474 --> 31:53.174
Are you accusing me
of something?

31:53.209 --> 31:54.942
I'm not accusing you,
I'm telling you,

31:54.972 --> 31:56.405
you need to wake the hell up.

31:56.440 --> 31:57.873
What did you
just say to me?

31:57.908 --> 32:00.509
Do you know what Cahill's
gonna do once Jill's arraigned?

32:00.544 --> 32:02.504
He's gonna sit her down
for as long as it takes

32:02.505 --> 32:03.883
until she cuts a deal
to give you up.

32:03.907 --> 32:05.139
She would never do that.

32:05.176 --> 32:06.953
You have no idea what
she'll do when they get her

32:06.977 --> 32:08.076
into that room.

32:08.112 --> 32:09.678
And I'm telling you,
if my loser of

32:09.713 --> 32:11.858
a son-in-law didn't cave,
then Jill sure as hell won't.

32:11.882 --> 32:13.148
Listen to me, goddamn it.

32:13.184 --> 32:15.584
This isn't gonna be what it was
like it was with Kevin.

32:15.619 --> 32:17.019
What do you want from me,
Harvey?

32:17.054 --> 32:18.921
I want you to give me
authorization

32:18.956 --> 32:20.355
to cut you both a deal.

32:20.391 --> 32:22.624
You turn yourself in,
you get maybe three years,

32:22.660 --> 32:24.026
and you keep her out.

32:24.061 --> 32:25.527
Why the hell
would I do that?

32:25.563 --> 32:27.796
Because if she turns on you,
you're gonna be getting

32:27.831 --> 32:30.232
a hell of a lot more.

32:30.267 --> 32:32.834
I'm not cutting a deal.

32:33.096 --> 32:34.673
And you think if you're
willing to do this

32:34.697 --> 32:36.842
to your own daughter, she won't
be willing to do it to you?

32:36.866 --> 32:39.801
Jill's a young woman,
I'm an old man.

32:39.836 --> 32:42.203
She does a few years,
it hardly makes a dent.

32:42.238 --> 32:43.949
When she gets out,
she can still play tennis

32:43.973 --> 32:45.773
and go to Pilates
and do all the things

32:45.809 --> 32:47.642
I always gave her
the money to do.

32:47.677 --> 32:50.178
You knew it might
come to this, didn't you?

32:50.213 --> 32:52.046
<i>I love my daughter, Harvey,</i>

32:52.081 --> 32:53.981
<i>but she'd be nothing</i>
<i>without me.</i>

32:54.017 --> 32:56.017
<i>And she knows if</i>
<i>she does this for me,</i>

32:56.052 --> 32:59.086
<i>she'll be taken care of</i>
<i>for the rest of her life.</i>

32:59.122 --> 33:03.057
<i>So that's it?</i>
<i>No deal?</i>

33:03.092 --> 33:04.392
<i>No deal.</i>

33:12.602 --> 33:15.436
I'm sorry, Jill.

33:16.473 --> 33:18.206
I want to cut a deal.

33:18.241 --> 33:20.241
Are you sure?

33:22.912 --> 33:25.746
Yes.

33:25.782 --> 33:27.114
Can you do that for me?

33:27.150 --> 33:29.784
No, I can't.

33:29.819 --> 33:30.985
Why not?

33:31.020 --> 33:33.988
Because he represents
your father.

33:34.023 --> 33:35.823
But I don't.

33:35.859 --> 33:36.824
So I can.

33:47.679 --> 33:49.913
Tara, I didn't think today
could get any better,

33:49.949 --> 33:51.226
But whatever you did to
that water pressure

33:51.250 --> 33:52.628
is thing of beauty.
I haven't felt this fresh

33:52.652 --> 33:55.185
and clean since--
Louis, I have to talk to you.

33:55.221 --> 33:57.574
- What is it?
- Joshua called.

33:57.575 --> 34:00.309
He's coming to town tomorrow
for two days.

34:00.345 --> 34:01.989
But after last night,
I thought it was over

34:02.013 --> 34:02.979
between the two of you?

34:03.014 --> 34:04.647
Louis...

34:04.682 --> 34:08.451
we've been together for years.
I can't just not see him.

34:08.485 --> 34:09.886
So you're gonna
break up with him?

34:11.922 --> 34:13.222
I don't know.

34:22.165 --> 34:23.531
Welcome to Danbury, Sean.

34:23.565 --> 34:25.678
You know you're taking a big
risk that someone's gonna

34:25.702 --> 34:27.967
recognize me and figure out that
you're up to something.

34:28.004 --> 34:29.536
Well, I'd be taking an even
bigger risk

34:29.572 --> 34:33.407
if I didn't hand this
to you personally.

34:33.443 --> 34:36.110
You're not gonna weasel
out of my deal again.

34:36.145 --> 34:37.344
What is this?

34:37.380 --> 34:39.580
That is an iron clad agreement
between your office

34:39.614 --> 34:40.581
and Jill Miller.

34:40.616 --> 34:42.149
You're representing
Jill Miller now?

34:42.185 --> 34:43.551
Yes, I am.

34:43.585 --> 34:45.119
Does she know
that you're not a lawyer?

34:45.154 --> 34:46.687
She does.

34:46.723 --> 34:48.789
And she's okay with it
because I'm also the guy

34:48.824 --> 34:50.658
who's keeping her
out of prison.

34:50.693 --> 34:52.404
Let me save you the trouble
of reading that.

34:52.428 --> 34:54.406
It says that she's gonna testify
against her father,

34:54.429 --> 34:56.563
pleads no contest,
and receives full immunity.

34:56.599 --> 34:58.466
But it also says that
you acknowledge that

34:58.501 --> 34:59.934
I brought her to you.

34:59.969 --> 35:02.470
Hmm.

35:02.505 --> 35:05.039
Well, then I better bring it
to my office and sign it.

35:10.179 --> 35:12.880
Oh, and for what it's worth,

35:12.915 --> 35:14.393
I didn't try to
weasel out of your deal.

35:14.417 --> 35:16.684
I did everything I could
to keep it in place.

35:16.719 --> 35:18.919
Well, now it's
back in place.

35:18.955 --> 35:20.799
Because I just gave you
everything that you need.

35:20.823 --> 35:23.057
No, Mike, you didn't give me
everything yet.

35:23.092 --> 35:25.960
Because what I still need is
William Sutter behind bars.

35:34.575 --> 35:35.808
What the hell did you do?

35:35.843 --> 35:37.621
Nice to see you, William.
Can I get you a drink?

35:37.645 --> 35:39.612
You think I wouldn't find out
that you recorded me

35:39.647 --> 35:40.791
and played it
for my daughter?

35:40.815 --> 35:41.981
I didn't play it for her.

35:42.016 --> 35:44.483
I played it for my other client,
Kevin Miller.

35:44.519 --> 35:46.063
Jill just happened
to be there when I did.

35:46.087 --> 35:47.653
And now she's turning on me.

35:47.689 --> 35:50.122
Then I guess it turns out she
didn't want to wait five years

35:50.158 --> 35:51.891
to play more tennis
like you thought.

35:51.926 --> 35:54.794
Goddamn it, you broke
attorney-client privilege.

35:54.829 --> 35:56.829
I didn't break anything,
William.

35:56.864 --> 35:59.665
Because like I just told you,
Kevin's my client too,

35:59.701 --> 36:02.268
and I had an obligation
to share the facts with him.

36:02.303 --> 36:05.271
So instead of attacking me,
you should be thanking me.

36:05.306 --> 36:07.740
Because I went to Cahill
and cut you the best deal

36:07.775 --> 36:09.008
you're ever gonna get.

36:09.043 --> 36:10.409
Why would you
do this to me?

36:10.445 --> 36:11.811
You did this to yourself,
William.

36:11.846 --> 36:14.213
You had me represent
both you and Kevin,

36:14.248 --> 36:17.316
which means I had to choose
between two clients.

36:17.416 --> 36:18.749
And you said it, yourself.

36:18.784 --> 36:20.951
You're an old man,
and they're a young couple,

36:20.985 --> 36:22.418
and I chose them over you.

36:22.453 --> 36:25.755
I didn't have you
represent us both.

36:25.790 --> 36:28.457
It was your idea.

36:28.493 --> 36:31.294
I guess it was, wasn't it?

36:31.329 --> 36:33.129
You son of a bitch.

36:33.164 --> 36:34.664
You set me up!

36:34.699 --> 36:36.343
And I'm gonna make sure
the world knows it.

36:36.367 --> 36:38.734
You can tell the world
anything you want, William.

36:38.770 --> 36:41.203
But you've got no proof
and you'll be telling it

36:41.239 --> 36:42.505
from behind bars.

36:42.540 --> 36:45.441
Either way, I suggest
you sign this deal,

36:45.476 --> 36:47.243
'cause it's the best
you're ever gonna get.

37:01.747 --> 37:02.980
Jessica.

37:03.015 --> 37:04.214
What're you doing here?

37:04.250 --> 37:05.949
I had a great time
last night.

37:05.985 --> 37:08.151
And I was going to
call you about

37:08.187 --> 37:10.420
going out again next week
because I know

37:10.456 --> 37:11.688
you want to take it slow.

37:11.724 --> 37:15.459
But then I found out that
you want to take it slow

37:15.494 --> 37:19.096
because you may not
be here much longer.

37:19.131 --> 37:20.697
How'd you find out?

37:20.733 --> 37:23.500
They called for a reference.

37:23.535 --> 37:24.801
And what'd you tell them?

37:24.837 --> 37:26.770
I said them they'd be
lucky to have you.

37:26.805 --> 37:28.071
Thank you.

37:28.107 --> 37:29.973
Why didn't you tell me?

37:30.009 --> 37:31.993
Because I wasn't sure
I was gonna take it.

37:32.093 --> 37:33.426
But now you are.

37:33.461 --> 37:35.761
Jessica, if I thought there
would be a chance in the world

37:35.797 --> 37:38.064
that you would come with me,
I would've asked you.

37:38.099 --> 37:40.666
But we both know
that's not gonna happen.

37:40.702 --> 37:42.668
Because you told me
it's not over yet,

37:42.704 --> 37:47.540
but what you meant is that
it's never gonna be over.

37:47.575 --> 37:50.309
It's my firm, Jeff.

37:50.345 --> 37:52.612
It's the thing I spent
my whole life building.

37:52.647 --> 37:54.513
And I'm not
judging you for it.

37:54.549 --> 37:57.583
You are who you are,

37:57.619 --> 37:59.852
and I love who you are.

37:59.887 --> 38:01.921
But I've been thinking about
going back to Chicago

38:01.956 --> 38:06.759
for a long time now,
and as much as seeing you again

38:06.794 --> 38:09.795
makes me want to stay here...

38:12.600 --> 38:15.568
This is something
I have to do.

38:17.171 --> 38:20.773
Like I said.

38:20.808 --> 38:22.575
They're lucky to have you.

38:40.222 --> 38:42.957
It's done.

38:42.992 --> 38:45.726
Sutter took the deal.

38:45.761 --> 38:48.762
Jill's safe.

38:55.271 --> 38:57.271
Thank God.

38:59.308 --> 39:01.709
I'm, uh...

39:01.744 --> 39:04.745
I'm sorry that Jill had to
hear what she heard.

39:07.316 --> 39:10.851
It was the only way, man.

39:10.886 --> 39:12.186
Besides, you didn't say it.

39:12.221 --> 39:13.532
No, but I did know
what I was doing

39:13.556 --> 39:15.823
when I agreed
to inform on you.

39:15.858 --> 39:17.124
I'm sorry.

39:17.159 --> 39:18.759
You didn't deserve
any of that.

39:18.794 --> 39:21.729
Hey, look, when we first met,
I let Gallo in here.

39:21.764 --> 39:24.164
And that was as much a betrayal
as what you did to me.

39:24.200 --> 39:26.133
Yeah, but you
didn't know me.

39:26.168 --> 39:27.735
I knew you.

39:27.770 --> 39:29.503
What, are you trying to
make me hate you?

39:31.907 --> 39:35.409
No.

39:35.444 --> 39:38.812
It's just that I'm getting out
and you're not.

39:38.848 --> 39:42.683
No, I'm not.

39:42.718 --> 39:45.152
But you kept my wife
out of prison,

39:45.187 --> 39:47.454
and as far as I'm concerned,
that makes us square.

39:51.627 --> 39:52.960
Thank you, Kevin.

39:57.066 --> 39:58.966
Where you going?

39:59.001 --> 40:00.300
Me?

40:00.336 --> 40:02.147
I'm gonna give you a few minutes
to enjoy the fact

40:02.171 --> 40:03.670
that you're getting out.

40:03.706 --> 40:06.874
And to call Rachel
and tell her.

40:20.256 --> 40:22.856
Hey.

40:22.892 --> 40:24.058
Donna,
I'm on to something.

40:24.093 --> 40:27.094
I just need one second
to write it down.

40:32.334 --> 40:33.901
What is it?
What're you so happy about?

40:33.936 --> 40:35.147
I think I just
figured out a way

40:35.171 --> 40:37.237
to get Leonard Bailey's
case reopened.

40:37.273 --> 40:39.473
Rachel, that's amazing.
Come on, get your things.

40:39.508 --> 40:40.819
We can talk about it
on the way out,

40:40.843 --> 40:42.209
because we're going to
celebrate.

40:42.244 --> 40:45.379
No, it's good news,
but I'm not ready to celebrate.

40:45.414 --> 40:48.182
Yes, you are.

40:48.217 --> 40:50.617
Because I'm not
talking about your case.

40:50.653 --> 40:53.520
Rachel,
Harvey and Mike did it.

40:53.556 --> 40:55.322
Mike's getting out.

40:55.357 --> 40:56.523
What?

40:56.559 --> 40:58.192
You heard me.

40:58.227 --> 41:00.527
They did it.

41:00.563 --> 41:04.765
Sutter's going away,
which means Mike's coming home.

41:06.068 --> 41:09.036
Oh, my God.

41:09.071 --> 41:10.071
Oh, God.

41:13.075 --> 41:15.008
Come on,
let's go have some fun

41:15.044 --> 41:16.084
while you're still single.

41:22.885 --> 41:26.487
It's Mike.

41:26.522 --> 41:27.654
Hello?

41:27.690 --> 41:29.189
Hey, it's me.

41:29.225 --> 41:30.991
I know it's you.

41:31.026 --> 41:33.260
It's over.

41:33.295 --> 41:36.296
I'm coming home.

41:36.332 --> 41:39.800
I just heard.

41:39.835 --> 41:42.436
God, I love you so much.

41:42.471 --> 41:44.938
<i>I love you, too.</i>
