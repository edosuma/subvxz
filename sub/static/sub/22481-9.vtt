WEBVTT

00:03.271 --> 00:05.273
*

00:12.446 --> 00:14.482
Something wrong, Tucker?

00:14.515 --> 00:15.749
Round everyone up

00:15.783 --> 00:17.385
into the conference
room, Alice.

00:25.426 --> 00:29.163
Tucker, why are
you doing this?
Where's Brittany?

00:29.197 --> 00:30.564
I-I don't know.
What do you mean,
you don't know?

00:30.598 --> 00:32.666
You all huddle
and talk and gossip

00:32.700 --> 00:34.635
about everything
with each other.

00:45.179 --> 00:49.417
20-David to Command. D-Team is
on the one-four corner.

00:49.450 --> 00:51.719
Checking point of entry.
Stand by.

00:51.752 --> 00:53.487
Chris, get the snake cam ready.

00:53.521 --> 00:56.390
Confirm non-lethal rounds,
hostages in close vicinity.

00:56.424 --> 00:57.558
Roger that.

00:57.591 --> 00:59.193
Candace.

00:59.227 --> 01:01.862
You two are friends.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.265
Where is she hiding?
She's not.

01:04.298 --> 01:06.467
She's pitching
new clients in Burbank.

01:08.636 --> 01:10.704
TUCKER:
All right, Candace.

01:10.738 --> 01:11.839
Go stand against the wall.

01:11.872 --> 01:14.575
This is only gonna make things
worse for you, Tucker.

01:14.608 --> 01:17.511
Oh, and getting passed up
for the third time

01:17.545 --> 01:20.248
by a woman won't?

01:20.281 --> 01:23.351
None of you get
to laugh at me anymore.

01:23.384 --> 01:24.552
She's just
your favorite.

01:24.585 --> 01:27.355
You don't think
everyone sees

01:27.388 --> 01:29.257
your little girls' club?
Well, I see it!

01:29.290 --> 01:32.293
Luca. On our kick,
blow it on three.

01:32.326 --> 01:33.294
You got it.

01:33.327 --> 01:35.229
Ready, go.

01:49.677 --> 01:52.713
Is everyone all right?
Is there anyone else with him?

01:52.746 --> 01:54.848
No. It was just him.

01:54.882 --> 01:57.351
20-David to Command.
Suspect is down.

01:57.385 --> 01:58.319
All hostages are safe.

01:58.352 --> 02:01.855
We're gonna need an ambulance
for our suspect.

02:07.361 --> 02:09.863
That was a decent way
to start the day.

02:09.897 --> 02:11.932
Oh, I did a muscle-up
circuit to start my day,

02:11.965 --> 02:13.767
but yeah, I get
what you mean.

02:13.801 --> 02:15.403
Well, while you
were busy training

02:15.436 --> 02:17.871
for the Meathead Olympics,
I was at the range

02:17.905 --> 02:19.807
putting in another
top course time.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.809
Time

02:21.842 --> 02:23.511
Seen those differentials
of yours.

02:23.544 --> 02:25.746
Yeah. Top of my
class in Long Beach.

02:25.779 --> 02:28.949
Boy, you would've been scraping
the barrel in my Hollywood days.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.685
Oh, yeah, you Hollywood guys.

02:31.719 --> 02:33.954
You're known for...
What is it again?

02:33.987 --> 02:36.324
Babysitting child stars
at movie premieres?

02:36.357 --> 02:37.591
Well, that reminds me

02:37.625 --> 02:39.393
of a couple competitive
young'uns way back when.

02:39.427 --> 02:41.695
Yeah, I'd like to think that we
tried to make each other better.

02:41.729 --> 02:43.431
The best.

02:43.464 --> 02:44.865
For the record,
we all know

02:44.898 --> 02:46.300
I got 'em beat on every one

02:46.334 --> 02:47.568
of our physical evaluations,
right?

02:47.601 --> 02:49.337
Yeah, except for arm wrestling.

02:49.370 --> 02:52.606
Which isn't SWAT regulation.
Yeah, well, it should be.

02:55.909 --> 02:59.647
Welcome to California, boys.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.948
I told you it'd be paradise.

03:00.981 --> 03:04.252
Oh, forget the Rose Bowl.
I want Rose Bud.

03:04.285 --> 03:05.919
No, come on, that's
a marketing gimmick.

03:05.953 --> 03:07.955
No, what you want

03:07.988 --> 03:10.324
is the Elmshorn Indica.
Trust me, Bryen.

03:10.358 --> 03:12.326
No, I'll take whatever's
the strongest stuff.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.395
Well, then, I would recommend
some of the edibles,

03:14.428 --> 03:16.597
like the Cannabis Cookies
or the Bud Brownies,

03:16.630 --> 03:17.931
for a way more potent high.

03:17.965 --> 03:18.999
BRYEN:
All of the above.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.868
I can't believe
everything's legal.

03:22.770 --> 03:24.905
Everyone down on the floor now!

03:26.640 --> 03:28.742
All the cash, in here.

03:28.776 --> 03:29.743
Not the register!
I want the safe!

03:29.777 --> 03:31.245
Armored car picked up
our haul this morning.

03:31.279 --> 03:32.246
All I got's in here.

03:32.280 --> 03:33.347
Don't feed me that BS.

03:33.381 --> 03:34.715
Look, it's Bowl Week, man.

03:34.748 --> 03:37.518
We're doing daily drops
'cause it's so busy.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.620
Hey, I'm telling you, man,

03:39.653 --> 03:42.390
a-all I've got is maybe
700 bucks on hand, tops.

03:42.423 --> 03:43.724
The combos, dude!
We're not playing!

03:43.757 --> 03:46.827
I don't know it, okay?
Only the manager does.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.597
Your boss's cash,
or your funeral.

03:49.630 --> 03:50.664
Please, don't. Please, don't.

03:50.698 --> 03:53.567
They're gonna kill everyone.

03:53.601 --> 03:55.002
We have to stop 'em.

03:55.035 --> 03:56.604
WOMAN: Hey, the next place
we hit's gonna be flush.

03:56.637 --> 03:58.772
Let's just ditch this.

04:02.376 --> 04:03.444
No!

04:24.064 --> 04:25.399
Please...

04:27.034 --> 04:28.869
Let's go. Now.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.344
Well, as a reward for a job
well done, we got our

04:36.377 --> 04:37.811
Physical Fitness
Qualifications in ten.

04:37.845 --> 04:40.381
Been looking forward
to improving my TAC run.

04:40.414 --> 04:42.883
From hours to minutes?
Cool, man.
I'll work on my run

04:42.916 --> 04:45.353
if you work on
your rope ascent.

04:45.386 --> 04:47.488
I clocked 12 seconds
last month.
Cool, man.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.357
Holler when you
hit single digits.

04:49.390 --> 04:51.024
DISPATCHER:
1-1-4 be advised.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.693
Shots fired at a dispensary
on Lankershim and Hamlin.

04:52.726 --> 04:53.961
Multiple victims reported.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.596
Active shooter in the vicinity.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.097
Well, PFQ's gonna have to wait.
Call it in, Luca.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.532
Dispatch, 22-David.

04:58.566 --> 05:01.569
D-Team is active.
We're en route. Let's go.

05:08.509 --> 05:09.643
Go.

05:10.944 --> 05:13.013
It's clear.

05:13.046 --> 05:15.649
Modified 12-gauge.
That did not come off a shelf.

05:15.683 --> 05:17.551
Breaching rounds,
judging by the damage.

05:19.052 --> 05:20.821
Deac.

05:20.854 --> 05:23.457
Go.

05:23.491 --> 05:24.625
Police, hands up!
Hands up!
Oh, no, no!

05:24.658 --> 05:26.594
Hey, I work here,
I work here.
You alone?

05:26.627 --> 05:29.029
No, no, I got a kid back here
who's freaking out.

05:35.469 --> 05:36.737
What happened?

05:36.770 --> 05:38.706
College kids in town for
the Rose Bowl tomorrow.

05:38.739 --> 05:39.907
Well, their friend right
there got a good look

05:39.940 --> 05:41.975
at one of their faces.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.544
Proprietor says we got three
active shooters on the loose.

05:43.577 --> 05:44.478
LUCA: Yeah,
and they mentioned

05:44.512 --> 05:47.381
hitting another
dispensary after this one.

05:47.415 --> 05:49.717
Weed shops are a popular target.
Nothing but cash on hand,

05:49.750 --> 05:51.118
since banks won't
do business with them.

05:51.151 --> 05:52.085
There've been
a dozen robberies

05:52.119 --> 05:54.154
of places like this
in the last two months.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.089
Well, this crew may have been
responsible for some of them,

05:56.123 --> 05:57.425
but nobody started
dying until now.

05:57.458 --> 05:58.459
Hondo.

05:58.492 --> 06:00.594
Can we talk privately?

06:06.434 --> 06:08.101
You know a guy named
Landry Belmont?

06:08.135 --> 06:10.604
No, I don't think so. Why?

06:10.638 --> 06:12.606
Well, he's down at HQ filing
a complaint against you.

06:12.640 --> 06:13.907
For what?

06:13.941 --> 06:16.176
Unlawful search
and seizure, theft,

06:16.209 --> 06:18.078
excessive force
while off duty.

06:18.111 --> 06:19.813
That's a load
of bull, Commander.

06:19.847 --> 06:21.048
I'm sure it is,

06:21.081 --> 06:22.850
but as long as it's
an open matter,

06:22.883 --> 06:23.851
I'm gonna have to bench you.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.620
Bench me? We got two dead kids.

06:26.654 --> 06:28.589
The crew responsible is still
out there. I got work to do.

06:28.622 --> 06:29.557
Understood.

06:29.590 --> 06:30.624
And so do I.

06:30.658 --> 06:31.892
Protocol is you go back to HQ

06:31.925 --> 06:33.694
and you talk to IAD.

06:33.727 --> 06:34.928
Deacon.

06:34.962 --> 06:37.498
Until further notice,
team's yours.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.776
*

07:22.042 --> 07:23.777
You know what, Hicks
has to know this is bogus.

07:23.811 --> 07:24.912
Anything we can do
about this, Deac?

07:24.945 --> 07:26.179
I'm sure Hondo
did nothing wrong,

07:26.213 --> 07:27.681
but we got to let the
system run its course.

07:27.715 --> 07:29.082
Meantime, we got
to scoop up this crew.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.151
So let's earn our paycheck.
What do we know?

07:31.184 --> 07:33.020
Witness say the suspects
rode in on dirt bikes

07:33.053 --> 07:34.221
and hit the joint
in Motocross gear.

07:34.254 --> 07:35.656
Similar MO to a crew

07:35.689 --> 07:37.057
I took down in Hollywood
three years ago.

07:37.090 --> 07:38.892
The Trocaderos. You think
they're copycats?

07:38.926 --> 07:40.160
Uh, maybe.

07:40.193 --> 07:41.962
CI I worked with then
could have some intel.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.664
Might take greasing
some wheels.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.666
All right, Street, you go
with Tan and work the informant.

07:45.699 --> 07:47.901
Luca and Chris, work with RHD
and NoHo Division,

07:47.935 --> 07:49.236
leading a two-mile wide
search in case

07:49.269 --> 07:50.638
these suspects are hiding,

07:50.671 --> 07:52.506
waiting for us to clear out.

07:52.540 --> 07:54.474
Let's get these guys
before kickoff tomorrow.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.711
Deacon.
Detective Boyd.

07:57.745 --> 08:00.080
I'm rolling two of my guys
to Robbery-Homicide.

08:00.113 --> 08:01.615
Both victims were hit

08:01.649 --> 08:02.850
with exploding shotgun slugs

08:02.883 --> 08:04.585
from that modified
Remington 870 in there.

08:04.618 --> 08:06.554
We need skiptraces
on all weapons modifiers,

08:06.587 --> 08:07.855
starting in this area.
Okay.

08:07.888 --> 08:09.022
Now, you want to run point
with my team from SWAT HQ,

08:09.056 --> 08:10.791
you're welcome to.

08:12.726 --> 08:14.127
I want these guys yesterday.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.095
We're on it.

08:17.898 --> 08:20.934
Okay, straight up,
I scored some dope nearby.

08:20.968 --> 08:24.738
I had 42 days of sobriety
and then I fell off the wagon.

08:24.772 --> 08:26.006
I mean, maybe it was 43,
because this happened

08:26.039 --> 08:27.641
after midnight, so if...

08:27.675 --> 08:29.910
So you were driving back
home through South L.A.

08:29.943 --> 08:32.813
with your newly
procured drugs.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.047
What are you saying
Sergeant Harrelson

08:34.081 --> 08:35.082
did to you, exactly?

08:35.115 --> 08:37.217
Well, after I scored, I, uh...

08:37.250 --> 08:39.587
I noticed there was a car
following me, but I, you know,

08:39.620 --> 08:41.622
I thought it was some fool
just trying to rip me off.

08:41.655 --> 08:44.692
But that's when the police
lights turned on, you know.

08:44.725 --> 08:47.327
It didn't seem
like no police car.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.697
Did you see what kind
of vehicle it was?

08:49.730 --> 08:51.932
Uh... Yeah, no,
it was a Camaro.

08:51.965 --> 08:54.835
Plates started
with "7AG..."

08:54.868 --> 08:57.237
...that's all I could get.

08:57.270 --> 08:58.806
Couldn't get the rest.

08:58.839 --> 09:00.340
You know, maybe it was
this guy's personal ride.

09:00.373 --> 09:01.408
I don't know.

09:01.441 --> 09:03.944
Then the-the guy, he comes
up to my window, right,

09:03.977 --> 09:06.814
and he flashes his badge.
Seems real.

09:06.847 --> 09:08.649
I-I memorized
the-the number on it.

09:08.682 --> 09:12.019
He wasn't wearing a uniform,

09:12.052 --> 09:13.186
but he said he was a cop.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.923
Black guy with a goatee.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.157
NADYA: You claim
Sergeant Harrelson

09:17.190 --> 09:18.325
proceeded to search
your vehicle?

09:18.358 --> 09:19.993
Yeah. Didn't even
ask permission.

09:20.027 --> 09:21.895
And I told him that
I wasn't consenting to it,

09:21.929 --> 09:23.196
but he just ignored me.

09:23.230 --> 09:26.934
He found the drugs under
my seat, of course.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.936
But then I see him-- he, like,
sticks it in his pocket.

09:28.969 --> 09:30.738
The mistake that I made
was I said, you know,

09:30.771 --> 09:32.172
"What are you doing with that?"
I guess he didn't like that,

09:32.205 --> 09:33.741
'cause he pulls me
out of the car,

09:33.774 --> 09:36.043
shoves my face
down into the hood. Hard.

09:36.076 --> 09:39.279
And he says, uh, that he doesn't
want drugs in his neighborhood.

09:39.312 --> 09:42.816
And then, uh, he grabbed my
wallet and he took all my cash.

09:42.850 --> 09:44.317
He took me for
over 200 bucks.

09:44.351 --> 09:47.187
And then when I brought that up
again, he-he punched me.

09:47.220 --> 09:50.190
In the side. Twice.
Look, see?

09:50.223 --> 09:51.792
I got a mark still.

09:54.294 --> 09:55.796
Do you recall what
Sergeant Harrelson

09:55.829 --> 09:57.865
was wearing that night?
Um...

09:57.898 --> 10:00.100
I think... tan pants.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.268
Like, a gray sweatshirt.

10:01.301 --> 10:02.903
We have security
cameras here.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.905
We can verify what he was
wearing that night.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.173
Great.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.374
Get it.

10:07.407 --> 10:08.809
It'll prove that
I'm telling the truth.

10:19.186 --> 10:21.655
Wait, no, Hondo.

10:21.689 --> 10:23.056
Just wanted to
break a sweat, man.

10:23.090 --> 10:26.293
Wasn't looking to
mix it up for real.

10:38.238 --> 10:40.207
Your parents are on their way.

10:40.240 --> 10:43.944
They're in the air
as we speak.

10:44.878 --> 10:46.246
I heard you, uh,
you're not ready to talk

10:46.279 --> 10:47.681
to a sketch artist yet.

10:47.715 --> 10:49.082
I roped my friends into
coming out here.

10:49.116 --> 10:51.051
I took 'em to that place,

10:51.084 --> 10:53.353
and I just froze while
that guy shot both of them.

10:53.386 --> 10:56.690
What I know is, the best way
for you to honor your friends

10:56.724 --> 10:59.727
is by helping us find
who killed them.

11:00.894 --> 11:03.030
You and I, we gotta
do what we can

11:03.063 --> 11:05.432
to fight people like this,
send a message.

11:05.465 --> 11:07.000
That if you're gonna
hurt innocent people,

11:07.034 --> 11:08.769
there's a price to pay.

11:08.802 --> 11:11.404
And it's my job to ensure
that they bear that cost.

11:13.206 --> 11:16.209
Help me.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.884
So, this informant basically
broke your old case?

11:23.917 --> 11:25.953
Gave you all the intel you
needed to arrest the crew?

11:25.986 --> 11:29.056
I led a combined effort
between Vice, Gang Task Force

11:29.089 --> 11:31.291
and Narcotics divisions--
planned the entire sting.

11:31.324 --> 11:33.060
I get it. I get it.
Big takedown.

11:33.093 --> 11:36.096
But this CI basically gave
you a free pass into SWAT,

11:36.129 --> 11:37.898
is that what I'm hearing?

11:37.931 --> 11:39.967
You think I had it easy in
Hollywood Division-- I get it.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.903
Which one's our guy?

11:46.807 --> 11:48.141
What the hell
are you doing here?

11:48.175 --> 11:49.810
She is.

11:51.979 --> 11:55.282
Can't say I'm the biggest
fan of the short hair.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.150
I'm guessing that's
SWAT regulation?

11:57.184 --> 11:59.286
You look great, Ally.
Three years.

11:59.319 --> 12:03.090
Not one text, not even
to ask how I'm doing.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.892
How are you doing?
Honestly,

12:04.925 --> 12:07.127
can't say you caught me
on one of my better days.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.996
There's another crew, Ally.

12:09.029 --> 12:11.131
They got a similar MO
as the Trocaderos.

12:11.164 --> 12:12.866
It's been months
since I've ripped it up

12:12.900 --> 12:14.334
with anyone connected
to that crowd.

12:14.367 --> 12:15.803
But you're still tapped into
the Motocross circuits, right?

12:15.836 --> 12:17.037
Yeah. So what?

12:17.070 --> 12:18.205
We could just really
use your help.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.174
Can we talk somewhere quiet?

12:21.208 --> 12:23.143
I knew if I ever
saw you again,

12:23.176 --> 12:24.744
it'd be because
you needed something.

12:26.179 --> 12:29.116
I can't do this, sorry.

12:32.886 --> 12:35.555
Let me guess. Ex
Actually, no.

12:35.588 --> 12:36.957
We worked together
for nine months,

12:36.990 --> 12:38.558
got pretty close.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.194
So, did you or did you
not sleep with your CI?

12:41.228 --> 12:43.263
No, no, getting together
would've wrecked the case.

12:43.296 --> 12:46.066
But we talked about
being together after.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.367
Then you disappeared to SWAT.

12:47.400 --> 12:50.203
But you thought
you could make it work

12:50.237 --> 12:53.406
'cause you're the rescuer type.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.875
Then you left her hanging.
Something like that?

12:54.908 --> 12:56.143
Seemed like it was
for the best.

12:56.176 --> 12:59.079
I think maybe
you forgot to tell her that.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.447
Give me a minute with her,
all right?

13:00.480 --> 13:01.949
Yeah.

13:04.317 --> 13:06.119
I'm working.

13:06.153 --> 13:09.122
What happened to
your paint shop?

13:09.156 --> 13:11.058
Ripped it out.

13:11.091 --> 13:13.894
Bike artwork wasn't
paying the bills.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.295
In case you
haven't noticed,

13:15.328 --> 13:17.597
I'm in the scrap metal
business now.

13:17.630 --> 13:20.000
Trying to avoid
bankruptcy.

13:20.033 --> 13:22.335
CIs don't get a pension.

13:22.369 --> 13:25.305
But you said there was
a plan for us.

13:25.338 --> 13:27.407
I just didn't know
it was this.
If we became a thing,

13:27.440 --> 13:29.609
people would've put
two and two together.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.211
They'd know you helped me
on the case,

13:31.244 --> 13:33.580
there would've been blowback
for both of us.

13:33.613 --> 13:36.049
So that's your excuse?

13:36.083 --> 13:37.450
Pathetic.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.452
I totally get you're
pissed, all right?

13:39.486 --> 13:42.522
But I need your help...
and so do their families.

13:42.555 --> 13:44.624
Two college kids in town
for the game tomorrow.

13:44.657 --> 13:47.928
Both dead.

13:47.961 --> 13:49.596
You help me?
Just 'cause I still
work on bikes

13:49.629 --> 13:51.932
doesn't mean riders
are gonna open up.

13:51.965 --> 13:53.967
I gotta ask
touchy questions.

13:54.001 --> 13:55.368
People get hip
to that game.

13:55.402 --> 13:57.204
It's a risk.
We get this crew,

13:57.237 --> 14:00.908
I'll find a way
to make it up to you.

14:02.009 --> 14:03.110
Fine.

14:03.143 --> 14:05.645
But from now on,

14:05.678 --> 14:08.015
I only deal with your partner.

14:08.048 --> 14:09.983
'Cause you and I are done.

14:12.352 --> 14:13.987
HONDO:
Sir,

14:14.021 --> 14:15.388
who is this guy?
What's he accusing me of?

14:15.422 --> 14:16.556
Landry Belmont.

14:16.589 --> 14:17.557
Says you pulled him over
off the clock,

14:17.590 --> 14:18.892
took his money, drugs,

14:18.926 --> 14:20.427
and roughed him up.
Not a chance.

14:20.460 --> 14:21.962
You haven't seen this guy
in the last two weeks?

14:21.995 --> 14:23.330
I've never seen him
before in my life.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.898
Is there any reason why
he'd make it up?

14:24.932 --> 14:26.166
Sir, a bunch of guys
I've put away

14:26.199 --> 14:27.434
have my name tattooed on 'em.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.069
Look, I get personal vendettas,

14:29.102 --> 14:31.038
but this guy's nobody to me,
he's lying.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.940
The clothing you wore
that night matches

14:32.973 --> 14:34.607
Landry's description.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.376
Where were you shortly after
midnight the night of the 19th?

14:36.409 --> 14:38.345
What, was that a Tuesday?

14:38.378 --> 14:39.612
I mean, I'd have to
think about it.

14:39.646 --> 14:41.548
We're trying to prove
this guy is lying,

14:41.581 --> 14:43.350
and I believe you,
but this clown keeps

14:43.383 --> 14:45.318
coming up with details
that check out.

14:45.352 --> 14:47.020
And you're not
providing an alibi.

14:47.054 --> 14:48.956
IAD has to push this
up the flagpole,

14:48.989 --> 14:50.623
which means you're
officially on desk duty

14:50.657 --> 14:53.226
until it's adjudicated.
That could take weeks.

14:53.260 --> 14:54.494
We'll bring in a union rep
to go through your options.

14:54.527 --> 14:56.229
Yeah.

14:57.697 --> 15:00.267
Let's go talk.

15:06.139 --> 15:07.674
I'm worried.

15:07.707 --> 15:09.977
As my girlfriend
or as my boss?

15:10.010 --> 15:11.578
Either way, Jess,
this is ridiculous.

15:11.611 --> 15:14.147
JESSICA:
The 19th...hang on, hang on...

15:15.983 --> 15:17.417
I had a 5:00 meeting

15:17.450 --> 15:20.020
with Councilman Webber
earlier that day.

15:20.053 --> 15:22.722
After that,
I went to the grocery store,

15:22.755 --> 15:24.624
and drove to your place
to cook us dinner.

15:24.657 --> 15:27.294
Yeah, that's right.
And I got home at, what?

15:27.327 --> 15:28.495
What...about 10:30?

15:28.528 --> 15:30.197
We ate,

15:30.230 --> 15:31.698
and then we watched the
Laker game go into overtime.

15:31.731 --> 15:33.133
And you stayed
the rest of the night.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.201
See, I told you
I didn't do this.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.536
Never thought you did.

15:36.569 --> 15:40.040
But now I'm your alibi.

15:41.741 --> 15:43.576
And you can't come
forward with it.

15:44.377 --> 15:46.746
I could.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.148
I will.

15:48.181 --> 15:49.516
And then what?

15:49.549 --> 15:51.251
What kind of trouble
would that put you in?

15:51.284 --> 15:52.752
Admit that we've
been violating

15:52.785 --> 15:54.621
department policy for
the last four months?

15:54.654 --> 15:55.989
No, I'm not selling you out

15:56.023 --> 15:57.124
to cover my own ass.
Or Internal Affairs

15:57.157 --> 15:59.159
investigates
and eventually finds out

15:59.192 --> 16:01.128
that we were together
that night anyway.

16:01.161 --> 16:03.630
And that we've been
keeping it all secret.

16:03.663 --> 16:05.532
I have to tell Hicks about us.

16:05.565 --> 16:08.001
Jess, you are
going places.

16:08.035 --> 16:09.536
You're about bigger things
than just this job,

16:09.569 --> 16:11.038
and I know you can achieve 'em.

16:11.071 --> 16:12.272
I'm not about to be the reason

16:12.305 --> 16:13.573
that your career
gets sidetracked.

16:13.606 --> 16:15.742
We need to deal with this now,
not later.

16:15.775 --> 16:18.045
Because it could really hurt
your career, too.

16:18.078 --> 16:19.712
We both know
this guy is lying.

16:19.746 --> 16:21.614
I just need to
figure out why.

16:21.648 --> 16:24.251
I just need time.

16:24.284 --> 16:28.255
Hondo, if you don't have
an answer by the morning,

16:28.288 --> 16:32.192
I need to tell Hicks everything.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.128
Deal.

16:35.162 --> 16:37.130
Give me till tomorrow.

16:37.164 --> 16:39.332
I'll clear my name.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.278
So, our kid came up
with a sketch.

16:51.311 --> 16:54.247
Can your CI make
a positive ID?

16:54.281 --> 16:56.549
She only wants
to deal with Street.

16:56.583 --> 16:57.817
I thought you two were tight.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.787
That's a long story.
But a juicy one.

17:00.820 --> 17:03.290
Hey, Deacon, we got a lead
on the weapons modifier.

17:03.323 --> 17:04.791
Robbery-Homicide

17:04.824 --> 17:06.593
recognized the type of
muzzle break on the shotgun

17:06.626 --> 17:08.161
found at the dispensary.

17:08.195 --> 17:10.130
A guy we jammed up once before
specialized

17:10.163 --> 17:12.099
in Remington 870s
with breaching rounds.

17:12.132 --> 17:13.566
We think he's manufacturing them
out of a house

17:13.600 --> 17:14.801
in Ladera Heights.
Okay, great.

17:14.834 --> 17:15.835
Let's get a call to DOJ,

17:15.868 --> 17:17.337
fast-track a warrant.

17:18.438 --> 17:20.407
Hey, Hondo.

17:22.342 --> 17:23.310
What's happening?

17:23.343 --> 17:24.777
HONDO: Hicks has
me sidelined

17:24.811 --> 17:26.713
until IAD finishes
their investigation.

17:26.746 --> 17:29.116
How long is that gonna take?
Can't say for sure.

17:29.149 --> 17:29.916
Well, we're here to help.

17:29.949 --> 17:30.850
Yeah, man.
Just tell us what to do.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.085
All right,
listen to me.

17:32.119 --> 17:33.153
I'm gonna take care of myself.

17:33.186 --> 17:35.255
You guys just stay focused
on getting this crew.

17:35.288 --> 17:36.723
Go on.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.558
Get it done.

17:41.128 --> 17:42.429
DEACON:
So, I got Chris

17:42.462 --> 17:45.165
and Luca working with RHD
to grab the gunmaker.

17:45.198 --> 17:47.300
Tan and Street are working
the informant angle...

17:47.334 --> 17:50.503
All right, Deacon. You don't
have to check in with me, man.

17:50.537 --> 17:52.372
You had my back
through my promotion,

17:52.405 --> 17:54.141
as crazy and messed
up as it was.

17:54.174 --> 17:57.310
I got your back now.
Thanks.

17:57.344 --> 17:59.112
It ain't easy being thrown
into all this without warning,

17:59.146 --> 18:00.447
I know.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.415
You got this.

18:02.449 --> 18:05.418
Trust your gut.

18:13.593 --> 18:16.129
Hi!

18:16.163 --> 18:17.597
Ally!

18:18.498 --> 18:21.234
Ally!

18:22.269 --> 18:24.437
Sorry.
I would've knocked, but...

18:24.471 --> 18:28.408
...you don't have
any doors in this place.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.710
Can you ID this guy?
Huh. Victor asked me

18:30.743 --> 18:32.845
the same question
three years ago.

18:32.879 --> 18:35.882
Everything about this
gives me PTSD.

18:35.915 --> 18:40.553
Look, uh, I haven't known Tan
that long, but...

18:40.587 --> 18:44.257
I heard him talking about
you today. He cares about you,

18:44.291 --> 18:46.259
and he feels guilty
about what happened.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.561
Is that your-your wingman way

18:48.595 --> 18:50.430
of getting me to tell you
who that is?

18:50.463 --> 18:53.800
I understand not wanting
to trust anyone, okay? I get it.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.903
You don't know anything
about what my deal's been.

18:56.936 --> 19:00.273
I read you grew up
in Orange County.

19:00.307 --> 19:02.575
Fell in with a tough crowd.

19:02.609 --> 19:04.744
Had some run-ins with the law.

19:04.777 --> 19:07.180
I know that growing up
in a good zip code

19:07.214 --> 19:09.782
doesn't always mean life's
gonna be puppies and rainbows.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.384
But I'm just trying
to solve this case here.

19:11.418 --> 19:13.920
So, if you want to help me,
help. If you don't,

19:13.953 --> 19:16.589
we don't have
to do this dance.

19:16.623 --> 19:19.326
You know him or not?

19:21.794 --> 19:24.431
Kane. Kane Markovich.

19:24.464 --> 19:27.567
His cousin was a part
of the Trocadero Crew.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.902
I used to paint
their bikes.
Kane was riding with two others.

19:29.936 --> 19:31.404
One's a woman.

19:31.438 --> 19:32.905
Probably Royce and Vera.

19:32.939 --> 19:34.941
Three of them used to race up
on the Piru circuit.

19:34.974 --> 19:36.543
You sure?

19:36.576 --> 19:39.312
They were all on the same
Motocross GP team.

19:39.346 --> 19:40.813
Tan and I owe you one.

19:40.847 --> 19:44.417
Yeah, but who's counting, right?

19:44.451 --> 19:46.553
DEACON: Kane Markovich.
Did a stint in county

19:46.586 --> 19:47.954
for aiding and abetting
six years ago.

19:47.987 --> 19:49.722
I took down his
older cousin's crew.

19:49.756 --> 19:52.225
He must've met his friends
on the same MXGP circuit.

19:52.259 --> 19:54.394
DEACON:
Royce Altona and Vera Stokes.

19:54.427 --> 19:56.529
Now, aside
from some eviction notices,

19:56.563 --> 19:58.698
they've only racked up parking
tickets and noise complaints.

19:58.731 --> 20:00.433
TAN: Yeah, Kane must've sold
them on the same dreams

20:00.467 --> 20:02.669
of wealth his cousin had.
Modern day version of outlaws

20:02.702 --> 20:05.338
hitting bootleggers.
No listed residences

20:05.372 --> 20:06.205
or last known locations.

20:06.239 --> 20:07.440
Our crew know
how to stay off the grid.

20:07.474 --> 20:09.576
Bikers. Always on the move.

20:09.609 --> 20:11.578
Hey, Deacon. We've got a
warrant on our gunmaker.

20:11.611 --> 20:15.315
And a breakdown of our
house in Ladera Heights.

20:15.348 --> 20:17.484
BOYDE: Doors and windows
look reinforced.

20:17.517 --> 20:18.585
It's built to keep cops out.

20:18.618 --> 20:19.719
Or at least delay
us long enough

20:19.752 --> 20:21.020
to get the draw on us.
DEACON: Okay,

20:21.053 --> 20:22.121
our robbery crew's
in the wind, but the guy who put

20:22.154 --> 20:24.357
the guns in their hand,
he might know where they are.

20:24.391 --> 20:26.326
I'd say we go with
a full breach assault.

20:26.359 --> 20:28.261
But being down a man,
that's stretching our capacity.

20:28.295 --> 20:30.697
We can take 'em. Attach
the spear-hook to Black Betty,

20:30.730 --> 20:32.432
pull the front door off.

20:32.465 --> 20:33.533
I appreciate your
enthusiasm, Street,

20:33.566 --> 20:35.835
but, like Hondo says,

20:35.868 --> 20:38.471
it's not always smart
to go in hard.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.341
Trust your gut.

20:41.374 --> 20:42.842
And what's your gut tell you?

20:42.875 --> 20:45.712
Chris, what kind
of civvy clothes you got here?

20:45.745 --> 20:47.614
What are you thinking?

20:47.647 --> 20:49.316
"Lost dog"?
No.

20:49.349 --> 20:50.917
I was gonna go
with "helpful neighbor."

20:50.950 --> 20:52.452
Mmm.

20:56.856 --> 20:59.058
*

21:09.569 --> 21:11.538
MAN:
Yeah

21:11.571 --> 21:13.806
Hey. I live eight doors down,
and I got a package today,

21:13.840 --> 21:15.975
but it's addressed
to here, to, uh...

21:16.008 --> 21:18.445
a Manolo Vasquez--
thought I'd walk it over,

21:18.478 --> 21:20.947
'cause it's insured
for over a thousand bucks.

21:21.581 --> 21:23.616
Is Manolo here?

21:25.485 --> 21:28.555
Yeah, just-just leave it
on the porch.

21:28.588 --> 21:30.523
Sure.

21:31.123 --> 21:34.026
Have a good day.

21:38.631 --> 21:41.100
Get down! Get down now!
On the ground!

21:41.133 --> 21:43.035
Police! Police!
Metro SWAT! Down!

21:43.069 --> 21:45.004
Metro SWAT!
Hands up!

21:45.037 --> 21:46.506
You ain't got nothin' on me!

21:46.539 --> 21:49.376
Hondo wouldn't do this.
His record is perfect.

21:49.409 --> 21:51.711
That won't stop Landry Belmont
from dragging this out.
In your legal opinion,

21:51.744 --> 21:53.380
how difficult
can he make it on Hondo?

21:53.413 --> 21:54.514
Well, listen,

21:54.547 --> 21:55.782
this is a PR battle now.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.350
Hondo's been
in the press recently.

21:57.384 --> 21:58.985
His face has been in the papers.

21:59.018 --> 22:00.953
The top brass isn't
gonna want him attached

22:00.987 --> 22:02.455
to any high-profile cases

22:02.489 --> 22:04.023
with this complaint
hanging out there.

22:04.056 --> 22:06.058
Depending on how long this
investigation drags out,

22:06.092 --> 22:09.462
I mean, they could push Hondo
to a desk for months, or...

22:09.496 --> 22:11.531
they could push him
right out of SWAT.

22:11.564 --> 22:14.934
I doubt they're willing to
cut Hondo loose completely,

22:14.967 --> 22:16.903
but I have seen
this done before.

22:16.936 --> 22:19.038
This is America--
we create heroes,

22:19.071 --> 22:21.608
and then we tear them down.

22:22.108 --> 22:23.443
Anything else?

22:24.711 --> 22:27.113
Yeah. On another matter,
off the record.

22:27.146 --> 22:29.716
A colleague works
in Boyle Heights.

22:29.749 --> 22:31.751
Just started dating
her watch commander.

22:31.784 --> 22:34.153
She asked about any blowback
if her captains find out.

22:34.186 --> 22:35.855
If the relationship

22:35.888 --> 22:38.658
just started, if they
immediately disclose it,

22:38.691 --> 22:42.028
and if one of them's willing
to transfer out of the division,

22:42.061 --> 22:43.730
shouldn't be a problem.

22:43.763 --> 22:46.866
But they keep it a secret
and it gets found out...

22:46.899 --> 22:49.769
well, the good news for her,
it'll be a lot tougher

22:49.802 --> 22:52.805
on her boss-- he's in command,
so he pays the bigger price.

22:52.839 --> 22:55.174
I've seen this occasionally,

22:55.207 --> 22:57.577
and it never
ends well.

22:58.511 --> 23:00.980
Trust me, it's not worth it.

23:01.013 --> 23:02.982
Tell your friend
to come forward now.

23:03.015 --> 23:04.517
I will.

23:04.551 --> 23:06.886
Thanks, Edward.

23:10.156 --> 23:13.159
Landry Belmont.
Yeah, I remember the hophead.

23:13.192 --> 23:15.728
Busted him for
scoring meth, twice.

23:15.762 --> 23:18.197
He connected to any big players
or shot callers we know?

23:18.230 --> 23:20.733
I'm just trying to find
the long game he's playing.

23:20.767 --> 23:22.134
This guy? Nah, man.

23:22.168 --> 23:24.036
He's lucky if he can
wipe his own butt.

23:24.070 --> 23:26.839
But if he runs up a drug bill,
who knows what kind of favors

23:26.873 --> 23:29.175
he might owe people, right?
Definitely
no gang contacts.

23:29.208 --> 23:32.044
But his dealer, Sherman Reinbek,
might have his marker.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.846
I'm sorry I can't
help you more, Hondo.

23:33.880 --> 23:37.049
I got to get back to Vice.
I appreciate it, Rahul.

23:40.052 --> 23:42.589
*

23:51.898 --> 23:54.200
I don't think
you're supposed to be in here.

23:54.233 --> 23:55.935
You enjoying this
little game you're playing?

23:55.968 --> 23:57.670
I'm just trying to
do the right thing.

23:57.704 --> 23:59.005
The right thing, huh?

23:59.038 --> 24:00.640
You think you're
only coming after me,

24:00.673 --> 24:01.808
but this affects other people.

24:01.841 --> 24:03.810
This goes way beyond
just the two of us,

24:03.843 --> 24:05.912
and I'm not okay with that.
Look, you already

24:05.945 --> 24:08.014
hurt me once, and now
you're trying to scare me.

24:08.047 --> 24:11.217
:
Please just leave me alone.

24:13.786 --> 24:15.522
We both know you're lying.

24:15.555 --> 24:17.624
And I'm good enough to prove it.

24:17.657 --> 24:19.626
So you better ask
yourself, do you want

24:19.659 --> 24:21.994
to make an enemy out of me?

24:22.695 --> 24:24.631
Hondo.

24:25.097 --> 24:25.965
What the hell's going on?

24:25.998 --> 24:26.933
He just stormed in here
and threatened me.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.868
Like he hasn't done
enough to me already.

24:28.901 --> 24:29.869
Bad move, Hondo.
Commander, that's not

24:29.902 --> 24:31.771
what I was doing at all.
No, look at the tape.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.573
Look. You'll see
for yourself.

24:33.606 --> 24:35.642
Hondo, out.

24:35.675 --> 24:37.476
Now.

24:45.818 --> 24:48.921
He obviously has a problem
controlling himself.

24:57.129 --> 25:00.099
All right, last chance before
we decide what to book you on.

25:00.132 --> 25:01.534
Where are they?

25:01.568 --> 25:03.202
I've only seen
one of them before.

25:03.235 --> 25:04.904
The guy with
the bald head.

25:04.937 --> 25:07.707
But I ain't got no idea
where he's at, man. Trust.

25:07.740 --> 25:09.942
His crew robbed a dispensary
and they killed two kids.

25:09.976 --> 25:11.778
And the slugs were
taken from a gun

25:11.811 --> 25:12.979
that you modified
illegally.

25:13.012 --> 25:14.280
So now's the time
for you to start

25:14.313 --> 25:16.115
working backwards
from guilty, Manolo.

25:16.883 --> 25:18.250
Yeah.

25:18.284 --> 25:20.820
Yeah, I modded
some shotguns for him.

25:20.853 --> 25:22.288
But buyers, most of 'em,
they just want to go

25:22.321 --> 25:24.223
and shoot off into the woods,
you know what I mean?

25:24.256 --> 25:26.292
Did you sell him
any more hardware from

25:26.325 --> 25:28.160
this illegal collection
from your basement?

25:28.194 --> 25:30.730
A Taser prong gun.
What does he want with that?

25:30.763 --> 25:32.765
The Taser prongs could
disarm an electric fence.

25:32.799 --> 25:35.735
Yeah. Some high-end dispensaries
use them as security.

25:35.768 --> 25:37.637
All right, get on the phone with
Detective Boyde-- you find out

25:37.670 --> 25:39.271
how many of these dispensaries
in L.A. have electric fences.

25:39.305 --> 25:40.740
All right, get him out of here.
STREET:
You really think they're

25:40.773 --> 25:42.609
gonna be hitting
other stores while we're

25:42.642 --> 25:43.976
out looking for 'em?
If I was them,

25:44.010 --> 25:46.045
I'd just be running.
Motocross riders
love the edge.

25:46.078 --> 25:47.780
No better rush
than taking down another score

25:47.814 --> 25:49.281
while we're looking for them.

25:49.315 --> 25:51.984
Big risk means these bikers
are looking for a big reward.

25:52.018 --> 25:54.553
They're not gonna stick their
heads out for small payday.

25:56.789 --> 25:59.726
All right, we've been on the
job for 22 straight hours.

25:59.759 --> 26:02.161
All 1,500 dispensaries
that we put out warnings to

26:02.194 --> 26:04.931
are closed for the evening,
so Luca and I will carry on,

26:04.964 --> 26:06.633
you three go get some rest.

26:06.666 --> 26:08.334
Meet back here
at 0800.

26:08.367 --> 26:10.903
*

26:18.310 --> 26:21.280
* Your blue veins...

26:22.815 --> 26:24.150
I thought I made it clear

26:24.183 --> 26:26.285
I was only gonna deal
with the other guy.

26:26.318 --> 26:27.820
That's on
business, and...

26:27.854 --> 26:29.021
I'm off duty until the morning.

26:29.055 --> 26:30.823
Then we got nothing
to discuss.

26:30.857 --> 26:33.159
I told your partner that I will
call when my mechanic friend

26:33.192 --> 26:35.161
gets any info.
We got a bead on the crew.

26:35.194 --> 26:38.297
I doubt you came here
to thank me.

26:38.330 --> 26:40.633
I came here to apologize.

26:40.667 --> 26:42.068
Three years too late, Victor.

26:42.101 --> 26:43.369
You spent

26:43.402 --> 26:45.037
all that time
thinking I didn't care.

26:45.071 --> 26:47.774
Truth is...
it's the exact opposite.

26:49.976 --> 26:52.244
You really are a special one.

26:52.278 --> 26:54.180
Mm-hmm.

26:54.213 --> 26:57.183
That's why I hate it
when you spew typical guy BS.

26:57.216 --> 26:59.652
And for the last
three years, I...

26:59.686 --> 27:02.722
I tried not to think about why
I disappeared from your life.

27:02.755 --> 27:04.190
I tried to forget why.

27:04.223 --> 27:06.659
But I never forgot you.

27:06.693 --> 27:08.294
Then why did you disappear?

27:09.696 --> 27:11.664
When the case ended,

27:11.698 --> 27:13.900
you and I were
in different worlds.

27:13.933 --> 27:17.003
You wouldn't have been happy
in the place I was in.

27:17.036 --> 27:19.906
Vice cop's life's a...
it's a 24/7 black hole.

27:19.939 --> 27:22.174
I-I had to get out.

27:22.208 --> 27:24.410
I thought
the only way was alone.

27:24.443 --> 27:26.979
*

27:29.315 --> 27:32.251
Truth is...

27:32.284 --> 27:35.254
you made the right choice.

27:36.989 --> 27:38.958
It sucks, but, um...

27:38.991 --> 27:40.459
* Blue veins...

27:40.492 --> 27:42.862
...you deserve
better than...

27:42.895 --> 27:44.831
me.

27:44.864 --> 27:47.433
That's not true.
Everything happens
for a reason, Victor.

27:47.466 --> 27:49.736
* And there's nothing
you need to... *

27:49.769 --> 27:52.671
We're both where we belong now.

27:53.272 --> 27:55.808
* Always the first one

27:55.842 --> 27:58.244
* To believe me

27:58.277 --> 28:00.279
* When I say to you, girl

28:00.312 --> 28:03.950
* I think it's gonna rain

28:03.983 --> 28:05.718
* But I could be wrong

28:05.752 --> 28:07.153
What's wrong?

28:07.186 --> 28:09.388
* Yeah, but all
of these things *

28:09.421 --> 28:10.923
* All these...

28:10.957 --> 28:12.424
Nothing.

28:12.458 --> 28:14.226
* They're all truly nice

28:14.260 --> 28:16.095
Nothing's wrong.

28:16.128 --> 28:18.765
* Ain't nothin'

28:18.798 --> 28:21.100
* Compared to the love

28:21.133 --> 28:24.703
* That's running
through your blue veins *

28:26.873 --> 28:30.309
* Your blue veins...

28:36.182 --> 28:37.884
Where'd you find him?
Slinging dope

28:37.917 --> 28:39.318
at 36th and Hoover.
All right,

28:39.351 --> 28:40.953
I appreciate the favor, Wallace.

28:46.492 --> 28:48.160
You want something
to drink?

28:48.194 --> 28:50.162
Eat?

28:50.196 --> 28:52.164
Am I getting booked
in here, or what?

28:52.198 --> 28:54.400
Well, that's up
to you, man.

28:54.433 --> 28:56.903
See, I got a real problem with
one of your regular customers,

28:56.936 --> 28:58.437
and I'm hoping
you can help me out.

28:58.470 --> 29:00.306
If so, there's every
possibility that you'll

29:00.339 --> 29:02.174
walk up out of here
right back home tonight.

29:02.208 --> 29:03.442
I'm all ears.

29:03.475 --> 29:06.445
Tell me about Landry Belmont.

29:06.478 --> 29:10.549
Man, now, that's a cat
with a drug problem.

29:10.582 --> 29:11.918
Real shame, too,
'cause I never

29:11.951 --> 29:14.086
really got the sense
that it was his thing.

29:14.120 --> 29:15.822
What you mean by that?
Got introduced to him

29:15.855 --> 29:17.423
about a year ago
through his girl.

29:17.456 --> 29:19.325
Now, drugs was her thing.

29:19.358 --> 29:22.328
He loved her, though,
so he started loving the dope.

29:22.361 --> 29:24.163
So Landry got a girlfriend.
Yeah.

29:24.196 --> 29:26.198
Dude would've did
anything for her.

29:26.232 --> 29:28.500
Don't know if they're together
now or not, on account of her

29:28.534 --> 29:30.036
going to prison.
Her doing time

29:30.069 --> 29:31.904
put a serious dent
in my bottom line.

29:31.938 --> 29:34.841
After that,
saw that fool Landry spiral,

29:34.874 --> 29:35.908
you know what I'm saying?

29:35.942 --> 29:37.176
Okay, hold up.

29:37.209 --> 29:40.179
What's Landry's girl's name?

29:40.212 --> 29:42.548
*

30:00.900 --> 30:04.470
My hookup says that your
crew's been hiding out

30:04.503 --> 30:08.240
at a blue house on
Valparaiso and Seamark.

30:08.274 --> 30:10.009
But they're not
there right now.

30:10.042 --> 30:11.978
Says they're raiding a
dispensary in the South Bay

30:12.011 --> 30:13.379
before blowing town
with the money haul.

30:13.412 --> 30:17.216
Dispensary with
an electric fence.

30:20.552 --> 30:23.222
It's like you're not
even here anymore.

30:23.255 --> 30:25.157
And neither am I.

30:25.191 --> 30:27.259
There are only so many of those
in the South Bay.

30:27.293 --> 30:28.560
I got to call Deacon.

30:28.594 --> 30:32.231
Well... bye, then.

30:39.939 --> 30:41.573
I'm gonna finish
this case,

30:41.607 --> 30:44.110
and then I'm gonna make up
for the last three years, okay?

30:44.143 --> 30:46.445
Okay.

30:54.120 --> 30:57.289
Hey. This is Hondo.
Leave a message after the tone.

30:59.491 --> 31:01.527
Hey, Rocker.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.930
Have you seen Hondo?
No, I haven't seen him.

31:04.463 --> 31:06.365
Thanks.

31:06.398 --> 31:09.068
Commander, do you have a moment?
Honestly, can it wait?

31:09.101 --> 31:11.003
It's like everything's
hitting me at this exact second.

31:11.037 --> 31:12.471
Sorry. No.

31:12.504 --> 31:14.240
I-It's important.

31:14.273 --> 31:15.641
What is it?

31:15.674 --> 31:18.377
It's about the complaint
against Hondo.

31:18.410 --> 31:20.947
All right.
I'm listening.

31:20.980 --> 31:24.083
I can prove that Hondo's
telling the truth.

31:25.451 --> 31:27.419
Great.

31:27.453 --> 31:28.787
What do you got?

31:32.658 --> 31:35.261
Let me start at the beginning.

31:35.294 --> 31:36.562
About four months ago...

31:36.595 --> 31:38.664
HONDO: I'm sorry
to interrupt, sir.

31:38.697 --> 31:42.168
Captain Cortez,
I need to speak to you.

31:42.201 --> 31:43.569
Right now.

31:43.602 --> 31:47.906
Actually, I'll come back.

31:50.209 --> 31:52.044
I've been trying
to reach you all morning.

31:52.078 --> 31:53.412
Well, I spent
the whole morning

31:53.445 --> 31:55.247
getting to the bottom
of Landry Belmont.

31:55.281 --> 31:57.616
Did you find something?

32:00.019 --> 32:03.922
*

32:07.559 --> 32:09.461
* Uh-huh

32:15.067 --> 32:19.071
* I started at the bottom,
I dreamt about the top *

32:19.105 --> 32:21.040
* I've been the man I am

32:21.073 --> 32:22.541
* And who I'm not

32:22.574 --> 32:24.610
* I've danced inside the ring

32:24.643 --> 32:26.678
* I've fallen to the floor

32:26.712 --> 32:29.615
* I've spat out my own teeth,
but I'm back for more *

32:29.648 --> 32:31.217
* Are you ready?
Down!

32:31.250 --> 32:32.451
* 'Cause I'm ready

32:32.484 --> 32:34.486
DEACON:
Hold on, hands up!
Go!

32:34.520 --> 32:37.056
* It's about to get heavy...

32:37.523 --> 32:39.291
Deac?

32:39.591 --> 32:41.060
Helmet!

32:41.093 --> 32:44.430
* All I know
is these times are changing *

32:44.463 --> 32:48.200
* Everything's about
to get crazy *

32:48.234 --> 32:50.769
* 'Cause all I know
is these times are changing... *

32:50.802 --> 32:53.439
I got them. Both heading
southbound, parallel to Soto.

32:53.472 --> 32:56.742
STREET: I got them.
On their six, parallel to you.

32:56.775 --> 32:57.709
DEACON: All right. Tan,
push them left on Leonis.

32:57.743 --> 33:00.212
Street, you keep them
south of Fruitland.

33:00.246 --> 33:01.613
I want to funnel these guys
to the factory alley.

33:01.647 --> 33:03.715
Smart.
Chris?

33:03.749 --> 33:05.717
CHRIS: I'm cutting off their
exit route to the north.

33:05.751 --> 33:08.687
* I've been to New York City

33:08.720 --> 33:10.656
* I've met The Rolling Stones

33:10.689 --> 33:12.724
* Moments you cannot buy
with your weight in gold *

33:12.758 --> 33:15.594
* Are you ready, baby?
'Cause I'm ready *

33:15.627 --> 33:19.198
* So come on,
everyone believe me *

33:19.231 --> 33:21.200
* It's about to get heavy

33:21.233 --> 33:24.670
* All I know
is these times are changing *

33:24.703 --> 33:27.739
* All I know is these times
are changing *

33:29.108 --> 33:31.710
* Everything's about
to get crazy *

33:31.743 --> 33:36.248
* 'Cause all I know
is these times are changing *

33:37.783 --> 33:39.818
* Come on, baby

33:39.851 --> 33:43.089
* Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah... *

33:48.527 --> 33:50.796
STREET:
I got them. Right behind them.

33:50.829 --> 33:52.364
* Come on

33:52.398 --> 33:54.700
* Clap your hands

33:54.733 --> 33:56.402
* Get into it, baby...

33:56.435 --> 33:57.503
I got them.

33:57.536 --> 33:59.338
Going to head them off.

34:01.207 --> 34:05.177
* For your own home
entertainment *

34:05.211 --> 34:07.146
* The Struts

34:07.179 --> 34:10.416
* Everything's about
to get crazy *

34:10.449 --> 34:14.253
* 'Cause all I know
is these times are changing. *

34:14.286 --> 34:16.288
No, I got them.

34:23.395 --> 34:25.431
Nice job, boss.

34:29.901 --> 34:31.570
Thank you for coming back
in today, Mr. Belmont.

34:31.603 --> 34:33.172
We finally have your
official statement typed up,

34:33.205 --> 34:34.506
and it's all ready
for you to sign.

34:34.540 --> 34:36.275
Thank you guys for, you know,

34:36.308 --> 34:38.644
u-understanding
where I'm coming from.

34:45.484 --> 34:47.653
JESSICA: It's our
responsibility to let you know

34:47.686 --> 34:50.489
that this statement will trigger
an official investigation.

34:50.522 --> 34:52.358
I should also point out
that lying on this statement

34:52.391 --> 34:54.660
is punishable by jail time.

34:58.330 --> 35:01.833
Just sign at the bottom
to make it official.

35:05.537 --> 35:07.406
Actually, you know what?

35:07.439 --> 35:11.210
I would-I would like to, um,
withdraw my complaint.

35:11.243 --> 35:13.679
What?
Yeah, I may have been
mistaken about that night.

35:13.712 --> 35:16.648
So everything you told us
was a lie?

35:16.682 --> 35:19.651
I-- No, I wasn't lying, 'cause,
you know, that's a crime.

35:19.685 --> 35:21.787
Like I said, I do drugs,
and I relapsed, and sometimes,

35:21.820 --> 35:23.789
on the wrong stuff,
my memory goes in and out,

35:23.822 --> 35:25.657
and I imagine things.

35:25.691 --> 35:27.626
I'm so sorry
if I wasted anyone's time.

35:27.659 --> 35:28.894
Am I free to go now?

35:28.927 --> 35:30.196
Yes.

35:35.201 --> 35:37.769
What the hell was that?

35:38.737 --> 35:41.773
Landry, what did you do now?

35:41.807 --> 35:44.343
Landry...

35:49.448 --> 35:51.183
Hondo, this was too close.

35:51.217 --> 35:52.518
I had my resignation signed
and everything.

35:52.551 --> 35:53.885
No, Jess.

35:53.919 --> 35:55.621
I'd offer up
my resignation long before

35:55.654 --> 35:57.823
I ever allowed you
to turn in yours.

35:57.856 --> 36:00.459
Someone want to explain
what the hell just happened?

36:00.492 --> 36:02.361
Who was that woman?

36:02.394 --> 36:03.829
That's the sister of Landry's
drug addict girlfriend.

36:03.862 --> 36:05.231
What does she
have to do with this?

36:05.264 --> 36:06.698
Nothing, really.

36:06.732 --> 36:08.800
But Landry's girlfriend Tabitha
has everything to do with it.

36:08.834 --> 36:10.202
Once we connected
the dots to her,

36:10.236 --> 36:11.837
Landry figured out
we were onto him.

36:11.870 --> 36:13.705
This Tabitha person, is she
somebody we should pick up?

36:13.739 --> 36:15.774
She's already serving time
in California Correctional,

36:15.807 --> 36:18.477
and that's where it
gets interesting.

36:21.647 --> 36:24.416
Our money's gone.
Is this a decoy cache?

36:24.450 --> 36:25.751
'Cause we'll turn this
whole place upside down.

36:25.784 --> 36:26.818
No! Look,

36:26.852 --> 36:28.487
I am trying to cooperate.

36:28.520 --> 36:29.921
When we left,
that floorboard was down,

36:29.955 --> 36:31.957
and my gym bag was in there
with all the cash

36:31.990 --> 36:34.360
from our last three robberies.

36:34.393 --> 36:35.494
Over 140 grand.

36:35.527 --> 36:36.562
You got another accomplice?

36:36.595 --> 36:37.596
No one.

36:37.629 --> 36:38.830
I swear.

36:38.864 --> 36:41.667
Someone ripped us off.

36:59.885 --> 37:01.520
ALLY:
Sorry, Victor.

37:01.553 --> 37:04.990
When I saw you get up and go,

37:05.023 --> 37:08.827
it made me realize that
nothing's ever gonna change.

37:08.860 --> 37:13.832
I saw a chance for some seed
money and a new start, so...

37:13.865 --> 37:19.271
this time, I'm ditching you.

37:23.642 --> 37:27.346
Sorry, man.

37:27.379 --> 37:29.381
You know, the truth is,

37:29.415 --> 37:33.519
some people just...
they don't want to be rescued.

37:36.087 --> 37:38.890
HONDO:
I heard

37:38.924 --> 37:40.626
you took down that crew
in style.

37:40.659 --> 37:42.328
:
Yeah.

37:42.361 --> 37:45.063
I got to say,
I really enjoyed it out there.

37:45.096 --> 37:46.932
Mm-hmm.
The team did great.

37:46.965 --> 37:48.734
I knew you'd get them, Deac.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.336
You know, watching you
these past few months

37:50.369 --> 37:52.538
definitely taught me some
things.

37:52.571 --> 37:54.406
I don't think
we would have got those guys

37:54.440 --> 37:56.475
if I hadn't borrowed
a couple of your moves.

37:56.508 --> 37:58.410
Nah, come on, man.
You handled your business.

37:58.444 --> 37:59.611
That was all you.

37:59.645 --> 38:01.613
TAN:
What's the word, Hondo?

38:01.647 --> 38:04.450
Hicks said the
complaint got dropped,

38:04.483 --> 38:06.318
like we knew it would.
I'm back.

38:06.352 --> 38:07.653
Hell, yeah.
The band's back together!

38:07.686 --> 38:09.087
LUCA:
I wasn't gonna say anything,

38:09.120 --> 38:10.622
but I could have sworn,
for the first time,

38:10.656 --> 38:11.757
I saw you sweat.

38:11.790 --> 38:14.025
Maybe a little bit.

38:14.059 --> 38:15.527
Maybe a little bit.

38:16.562 --> 38:17.863
Deac,

38:17.896 --> 38:19.531
all of you,
you had my back out there,

38:19.565 --> 38:21.467
and you got it done,
just like I knew you would.

38:21.500 --> 38:23.902
Great work.

38:25.537 --> 38:27.573
Hey, Street. I want to talk
to you for a second, all right?

38:27.606 --> 38:29.841
Sure.
All right, right on.

38:35.614 --> 38:37.749
So, listen, Street.

38:42.954 --> 38:44.790
I want to come clean
on something.

38:44.823 --> 38:48.394
A couple months ago, I went
to California Correctional.

38:48.427 --> 38:50.829
I had a sit-down
with your mother.

38:50.862 --> 38:52.631
You did what?

38:52.664 --> 38:55.133
When she sent you to
rough up that dude, Street,

38:55.166 --> 38:56.935
it wasn't because he was
threatening a woman.

38:56.968 --> 38:59.505
It's because he was supplying
her drugs and contraband,

38:59.538 --> 39:01.106
and you were helping her
send him a message

39:01.139 --> 39:02.641
to stay away
from the competition.

39:02.674 --> 39:04.576
Wait, wait, wait.

39:04.610 --> 39:06.545
You're saying you
think that my mom's

39:06.578 --> 39:07.979
some kind of
drug pusher now?

39:08.013 --> 39:11.149
Your mom's a player
in the pen, Street.

39:11.182 --> 39:14.019
She admitted it
to me.

39:14.052 --> 39:16.988
I told her to stop messing
with you.

39:17.022 --> 39:19.625
Your mom provided drugs

39:19.658 --> 39:21.527
for one of her addict friends
behind bars in exchange

39:21.560 --> 39:24.496
for her boyfriend filing that
complaint against me.

39:24.530 --> 39:27.032
He got my name. He watched me
come home from work,

39:27.065 --> 39:29.435
saw what I was driving,
what I was wearing,

39:29.468 --> 39:32.838
all so your mother could get
payback on me.

39:32.871 --> 39:35.574
Maybe I made a mistake
not coming to you before,

39:35.607 --> 39:39.177
so you do with that information
what you want.

39:39.210 --> 39:41.980
But now you know everything.

39:42.948 --> 39:44.950
We done here?

39:45.751 --> 39:47.753
Yeah.

40:00.766 --> 40:02.568
Hey. How are you, Mom?

40:02.601 --> 40:04.436
Mmm.

40:04.470 --> 40:07.138
All things
considered, decent.

40:08.239 --> 40:10.676
Can't say the same
about you, though.

40:11.943 --> 40:15.413
Looks like work's been putting
you through the wringer.

40:18.183 --> 40:21.553
Mom, did my boss, Hondo, come
and talk to you a while ago?

40:21.587 --> 40:23.622
Yeah, and I was gonna call you
about that,

40:23.655 --> 40:25.857
but I didn't want
to distract you from work.

40:25.891 --> 40:29.027
I got to be honest, Jimmy,

40:29.060 --> 40:30.762
he took it way too far.

40:30.796 --> 40:33.098
Really. Getting in our
family business,

40:33.131 --> 40:35.967
and I think he's trying to come
between you and me.

40:36.001 --> 40:40.806
Told me to not contact you
ever again.

40:40.839 --> 40:42.674
Do you believe that?

40:42.708 --> 40:44.876
I mean, not remotely,
you know, his place,

40:44.910 --> 40:46.211
but that's what he did.

40:46.244 --> 40:47.713
He said that you

40:47.746 --> 40:50.516
had me go after that guy
to send a message

40:50.549 --> 40:53.184
to a rival drug
supplier in here.

40:54.285 --> 40:56.755
Look, honey, this is prison,

40:56.788 --> 40:59.124
and you have to wheel and deal.

40:59.157 --> 41:01.493
There are people in here
that want me dead.

41:01.527 --> 41:03.662
If you don't have something
that folks want,

41:03.695 --> 41:05.497
you don't survive.

41:05.531 --> 41:08.066
In here, you're either power,
or you're property.

41:08.099 --> 41:09.768
You're not the only one

41:09.801 --> 41:13.071
who has to fight bad people
out there every day.

41:13.104 --> 41:14.573
Right?

41:14.606 --> 41:15.874
Hondo says

41:15.907 --> 41:17.709
you had some lady's boyfriend

41:17.743 --> 41:22.147
on the outside file a misconduct
charge against him?

41:22.180 --> 41:25.717
I've been complaining about your
boss messing with my family

41:25.751 --> 41:28.153
to just about everyone
on my block.

41:28.186 --> 41:30.522
And-and maybe
this lady, whoever she is,

41:30.556 --> 41:32.591
took it in her own hands,

41:32.624 --> 41:36.161
and tried to do something
about it to impress me.

41:36.194 --> 41:38.597
So you knew nothing about it?

41:39.831 --> 41:41.567
Jimmy, I'm alone in here.

41:41.600 --> 41:43.134
It's not my fault

41:43.168 --> 41:46.805
if somebody took matters
into their own hands.

41:57.616 --> 42:00.919
Everything that we've been
through together, Jimmy,

42:00.952 --> 42:03.088
I've always been there for you.

42:03.121 --> 42:05.023
I've always been by your side.

42:05.056 --> 42:08.293
I'm just trying
to survive, and...

42:08.326 --> 42:11.062
the only thing that gets me
through every single day

42:11.096 --> 42:13.832
is knowing that I'm
eligible for parole.

42:13.865 --> 42:17.068
Because then...

42:17.102 --> 42:19.705
I can be with my son again.

42:19.738 --> 42:20.839
I know.

42:20.872 --> 42:22.273
I can't wait.

42:22.307 --> 42:24.009
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

42:24.042 --> 42:26.778
I love you, Jimmy. I love you.

42:28.213 --> 42:31.717
I love you, too, Mom.
