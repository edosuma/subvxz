(male narrator)
Previously on a very special
Clone High...

00:09.667 --> 00:11.367
Joan got a new roommate,

00:11.367 --> 00:14.533
Abe and Cleo continued to date,

00:14.533 --> 00:16.800
and Gandhi became an inmate.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.367
Here's a paper plate.

00:18.367 --> 00:21.200
(Abandoned Pools singing)
* Way, way back in the 1980s

00:21.200 --> 00:24.133
* Secret government employees

00:24.133 --> 00:27.033
* Dug up famous
guys and ladies *

00:27.033 --> 00:30.067
* And made amusing
genetic copies *

00:30.067 --> 00:32.867
* Now the clones
are sexy teens now *

00:32.867 --> 00:35.700
* They're gonna make it
if they try *

00:35.700 --> 00:38.600
* Loving, learning,
sharing, judging *

00:38.600 --> 00:44.933
* Time to laugh
and shiver and cry *

00:44.933 --> 00:47.667
* Clone High

00:47.667 --> 00:53.333
* Clone High

00:53.333 --> 00:57.567
[cheerful music]

00:57.567 --> 01:00.633
[choir vocalizing]

01:00.633 --> 01:03.200
*

01:03.200 --> 01:05.867
[bells ringing]

01:05.867 --> 01:07.933
(Principal Scudworth)
Dear family and friends,

01:07.933 --> 01:12.067
is it possible a year has passed
since my last impersonal,

01:12.067 --> 01:14.833
over-informative
photocopied holiday update?

01:14.833 --> 01:17.067
I can hardly believe
it's only been a year

01:17.067 --> 01:19.667
since the United Nations
abolished religious holidays

01:19.667 --> 01:25.367
in favor of the non-offensive,
all-inclusive Snowflake Day.

01:25.367 --> 01:27.700
*

01:27.700 --> 01:29.500
Well, this blows.

01:29.500 --> 01:30.600
Oh, my God!

01:30.600 --> 01:32.067
Snowflake Day
is almost here.

01:32.067 --> 01:33.967
Snowflake Jake,
this holiday's mascot,

01:33.967 --> 01:37.267
will come to my house
and bring me spices upon spices.

01:37.267 --> 01:39.500
Oh, joyous day.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.633
What do you have against
Snowflake Day, anyway?

01:41.633 --> 01:44.400
It's not like all of those
exclusive religious holidays

01:44.400 --> 01:46.800
like Christmas,
Hanukkah, Kwanzaa.

01:46.800 --> 01:48.400
Ooh, it's time
for the ceremonial

01:48.400 --> 01:49.867
lighting of the snowman!

01:49.867 --> 01:51.133
* Bong-bong,
bong-bong *

01:51.133 --> 01:52.467
* Bong-bong,
bong-bong *

01:52.467 --> 01:54.533
* Bong-bong,
bong-bong *

01:54.533 --> 01:56.667
Jolly Snowflake Day, Joan.

01:56.667 --> 01:58.800
Would you like a bite
of my lamb taco?

01:58.800 --> 02:02.133
It's just not Snowflake Day
without a lamb taco.

02:02.133 --> 02:03.267
Cripes!

02:03.267 --> 02:06.267
Why is everyone
so cripes-darn cheerful?

02:06.267 --> 02:07.433
Well, you better
be cheerful

02:07.433 --> 02:09.300
at my annual
Snowflake Day party,

02:09.300 --> 02:11.333
because those crackers
won't hand out themselves.

02:11.333 --> 02:12.667
I can't wait.

02:12.667 --> 02:14.233
Neither can I, Joan!

02:14.233 --> 02:17.167
We're all going to exchange
Snowflake care satchels!

02:17.167 --> 02:19.100
Speaking of which, Abe,

02:19.100 --> 02:23.067
I can't wait for my big,
expensive Snowflake Day gift.

02:23.067 --> 02:24.767
Oh, don't worry, Cleo.

02:24.767 --> 02:27.067
I'll get you
the best gift ever.

02:27.067 --> 02:29.067
A clamp to keep
her legs closed?

02:29.067 --> 02:31.233
No, even better than that.

02:32.733 --> 02:34.233
[sighs]

02:34.233 --> 02:36.500
Where am I gonna get money
to get Cleo a good present?

02:36.500 --> 02:37.867
Have a bar mitzvah, dude.

02:37.867 --> 02:39.800
You get mad stacks.

02:39.800 --> 02:41.367
Sounds sweet,
but I think I'm gonna

02:41.367 --> 02:44.567
do the Christian thing:
get a job.

02:44.567 --> 02:45.800
Right on!

02:45.800 --> 02:47.367
Both Bill Gates
and Will Smith have jobs,

02:47.367 --> 02:49.400
and they're millionaires.

02:49.400 --> 02:52.067
(both)
To jobs!

02:52.067 --> 02:57.600
* It's the most lucrative
time of the year *

02:57.600 --> 02:58.900
Voice of an angel, baby.

02:58.900 --> 02:59.900
An angel!

02:59.900 --> 03:02.400
Gay dads,
enough fawning!

03:02.400 --> 03:06.667
We got to get my annual
Snowflake Day album done!

03:06.667 --> 03:08.533
* Deck the deck
with gay apparel *

03:08.533 --> 03:10.067
* Fa-la-la-la-la,
la-la-la-la *

03:10.067 --> 03:14.267
[laughing]
Gay apparel!

03:14.267 --> 03:15.667
Leather pants!

03:15.667 --> 03:16.600
You know?

03:22.333 --> 03:25.700
[grunting]

03:25.700 --> 03:28.067
Dude, this blows.

03:28.067 --> 03:30.233
I don't know how Will Smith
and Bill Gates do this.

03:30.233 --> 03:31.300
Come on, Gandhi.

03:31.300 --> 03:32.467
Two more hours,
and we'll have

03:32.467 --> 03:33.867
paid for the mall parking.

03:33.867 --> 03:35.933
(man)
I need a fork!

03:35.933 --> 03:39.767
Always with the utensils.

03:39.767 --> 03:41.767
(man)
And mayhaps a knife as well!

03:41.767 --> 03:43.600
Every time!

03:43.600 --> 03:45.200
I have to make two trips!

03:45.200 --> 03:46.400
"Can I have a fork?

03:46.400 --> 03:47.600
Can I have a knife?"

03:47.600 --> 03:50.600
Jeez!
Every time!

03:50.600 --> 03:53.533
Lincoln, we need
those plates right now!

03:53.533 --> 03:58.667
Gandhi, traditional Snowflake
sombrero dance pronto!

03:58.667 --> 04:00.267
What a jerk.

04:00.267 --> 04:02.633
Napoleon's got
some sort of a complex.

04:02.633 --> 04:04.767
I don't know what it is,
but, man.

04:06.433 --> 04:09.433
[humming Mexican Hat Dance]

04:09.433 --> 04:10.600
Run, fire!

04:10.600 --> 04:11.600
[people screaming]

04:11.600 --> 04:12.800
[glass shatters]

04:12.800 --> 04:16.867
We eat the mistakes here,
Monsieur Abe.

04:16.867 --> 04:18.700
But I dropped a glass.

04:18.700 --> 04:20.100
Eat it!
Eat it!

04:20.100 --> 04:22.300
Mangez le verre!

04:24.533 --> 04:27.533
[sighs]

04:27.533 --> 04:30.233
[crunching]

04:30.233 --> 04:32.167
[Gandhi screaming]

04:32.167 --> 04:33.900
[blowing frantically]

04:33.900 --> 04:36.833
[metal grinding]

04:41.133 --> 04:43.067
What?

04:45.200 --> 04:47.700
Abe, if I said we could
be millionaires,

04:47.700 --> 04:50.067
would you quit with me
right now?

04:50.067 --> 04:53.933
I'd give it some
serious consideration.

04:53.933 --> 04:55.233
[crunches]

04:55.233 --> 04:57.800
(Snowflake Jake)
Now, jump on me back

04:57.800 --> 05:01.167
and whisper your wish
for spices in me ear.

05:01.167 --> 05:03.800
If you don't fill my rack
with cumin this year,

05:03.800 --> 05:06.233
I swear to God,
I'll get you fired.

05:06.233 --> 05:07.500
Yo-ho-ho.

05:07.500 --> 05:09.633
You'll get your wish,
you bugger.

05:09.633 --> 05:11.067
Now, get off me back,

05:11.067 --> 05:13.300
or I'll murder
your grandparents.

05:13.300 --> 05:14.633
(all)
Aw!

05:14.633 --> 05:17.433
Why do I take this job
every year?

05:17.433 --> 05:19.900
[laughter]

05:19.900 --> 05:22.533
Now, go empty me chum bucket.

05:22.533 --> 05:25.700
It's starting to smell
like a day-old hooker.

05:25.700 --> 05:28.500
I hate you, you nasty,
crap-eating monkey!

05:28.500 --> 05:30.067
Arr!

05:30.067 --> 05:33.333
I'll tell you what spice
she's got: sassafras.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.500
[door slams]

05:34.500 --> 05:37.500
*

05:37.500 --> 05:39.467
I hate this stupid holiday.

05:39.467 --> 05:41.400
Don't say that, Joan.

05:41.400 --> 05:43.467
And I could have used that chum.

05:43.467 --> 05:46.267
Sorry, I didn't realize you--

05:46.267 --> 05:47.833
How'd you know my name?

05:47.833 --> 05:50.167
I don't know your name.

05:50.167 --> 05:51.767
I call everyone Joan.

05:51.767 --> 05:53.300
It's like saying "dude"
or "bro"

05:53.300 --> 05:56.067
or, in your case,
"Joan of Arc."

05:56.067 --> 05:58.533
But that's not important
right now.

05:58.533 --> 06:00.500
What is important is that you
continue to spread

06:00.500 --> 06:02.067
the Snowflake Day spirit.

06:02.067 --> 06:03.867
Snowflake Day sucks!

06:03.867 --> 06:05.867
All those kids
are so greedy.

06:05.867 --> 06:07.233
"Give me some spices!"

06:07.233 --> 06:08.533
"I'm fat!"

06:08.533 --> 06:10.500
"I want some parsley!"

06:10.500 --> 06:12.400
Lucky kids with their spices.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.233
I have to eat the salt
they sprinkle on the roads

06:14.233 --> 06:15.667
when the ice freezes.

06:15.667 --> 06:18.133
Who cares about spices
and seasonings

06:18.133 --> 06:20.067
and traditional
snowflake meats?

06:20.067 --> 06:22.333
Snowflake Day is just
another made-up holiday

06:22.333 --> 06:24.133
courtesy of
the greeting card industry

06:24.133 --> 06:26.667
just like Valentine's Day
and Easter.

06:26.667 --> 06:29.900
I can take her out right now.

06:29.900 --> 06:31.767
[gunshot]

06:31.767 --> 06:34.133
You know, for many,
this season is about giving,

06:34.133 --> 06:37.533
so, um, can I have 50Â¢
so I can eat today?

06:37.533 --> 06:38.867
Ugh! See?

06:38.867 --> 06:42.533
Even you, a homeless person,
greedy and selfish.

06:42.533 --> 06:44.600
Well, if it's spices
everybody wants,

06:44.600 --> 06:47.300
I'll pepper their precious
Snowflake Day

06:47.300 --> 06:50.333
with a little slice
of sabotage pie...

06:50.333 --> 06:52.267
Joan of Arc style!

06:54.333 --> 06:55.500
Hey, are you Mandy Moore?

06:55.500 --> 06:57.500
Me?
No.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.400
This mic doesn't even work.

06:59.400 --> 07:02.067
So you're just an incredibly hot
homeless person?

07:02.067 --> 07:03.967
You'd be surprised
at how many ab machines

07:03.967 --> 07:05.500
you find in dumpsters.

07:05.500 --> 07:07.267
Plus, I have a trainer.

07:16.433 --> 07:19.433
(Principal Scudworth)
In addition to my crippling
bunions from last year,

07:19.433 --> 07:22.867
I have also been
diagnosed with corns.

07:22.867 --> 07:26.700
But in this happy season,
we all have to be thankful,

07:26.700 --> 07:28.267
thankful that
the plantar warts

07:28.267 --> 07:31.467
in my other foot
have finally been removed,

07:31.467 --> 07:32.833
save one!

07:32.833 --> 07:36.767
I call him Gary,
and he's part of the family now.

07:36.767 --> 07:38.400
He'd better buy me
a good present.

07:39.467 --> 07:40.467
It's perfect!

07:40.467 --> 07:42.700
It's half knife, half fork.

07:42.700 --> 07:44.067
Like the spork!

07:44.067 --> 07:46.300
Vincent Spork took home
a Nobel for that baby.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.300
Mm-hmm, now people don't
have to hold a fork

07:48.300 --> 07:50.100
and a knife to cut
and then switch hands

07:50.100 --> 07:51.700
to eat their sweet meat.

07:51.700 --> 07:54.833
They can just just use
one brilliant tool.

07:54.833 --> 07:56.433
Like you, Gandhi.

07:56.433 --> 07:57.767
A brilliant tool.

07:57.767 --> 07:59.067
Exactly!

07:59.067 --> 08:01.300
Hey, why you bleeding, dog?

08:01.300 --> 08:04.300
Well, the knife portion seems
to have sliced open my cheek.

08:04.300 --> 08:06.067
How about a sliding
plastic sheath

08:06.067 --> 08:08.933
to cover up the blade
when the fork portion is in use?

08:08.933 --> 08:11.067
Okay, we're just gonna need
a system of ball bearings

08:11.067 --> 08:12.700
to make the sheath slide.

08:12.700 --> 08:14.800
But it'll need
to be counter-stabilized.

08:14.800 --> 08:16.433
I'm thinking...

08:16.433 --> 08:18.533
(both)
Trigger assembly!

08:18.533 --> 08:19.533
Jinx!

08:21.167 --> 08:22.833
Should we have a strap
to hold down the meat

08:22.833 --> 08:24.267
while we cut it,
or Velcro?

08:24.267 --> 08:26.067
Oh, Velcro, definitely.

08:26.067 --> 08:27.233
And there's only one solution

08:27.233 --> 08:29.667
for the oscillating
serrated edge.

08:29.667 --> 08:31.467
(both)
Coal power!

08:31.467 --> 08:33.200
Get out of my head!

08:33.200 --> 08:35.233
You get out of my head!

08:36.867 --> 08:38.700
I got to hand it to you,
the foot pedal

08:38.700 --> 08:40.633
and the Popsicle sticks
really work.

08:40.633 --> 08:42.167
We're gonna be rich, Gandhi.

08:42.167 --> 08:45.233
I'm gonna be able to buy Cleo
the best gift ever.

08:45.233 --> 08:47.733
Now, as far as the name,
I was thinking...

08:47.733 --> 08:48.733
Knifork.

08:48.733 --> 08:49.733
Bladeforker.

08:49.733 --> 08:50.733
Utens-all.

08:50.733 --> 08:51.733
Sir Slice-N-Spear!

08:51.733 --> 08:52.733
Fife!

08:52.733 --> 08:54.367
(both)
Knork!

08:54.367 --> 08:55.933
Oh, my God!

08:55.933 --> 08:58.233
- Fantastic!
- Awesome!

08:58.233 --> 09:00.667
Come on, man,
we rehearsed this.

09:00.667 --> 09:02.500
(both)
Sorry.

09:05.733 --> 09:07.633
(Snowflake Jake)
Arr, any last words,

09:07.633 --> 09:11.567
Santy Claus, Dreidelstein,
and King Kwanzaa?

09:11.567 --> 09:14.600
It be time for you
and your exclusionary holidays

09:14.600 --> 09:16.167
to walk the plank.

09:16.167 --> 09:17.833
Jake, don't kill us.

09:17.833 --> 09:20.900
We realize that the harmless
celebration of our religions

09:20.900 --> 09:22.700
is oppressive!

09:22.700 --> 09:26.067
Dreidelstein sorry.

09:26.067 --> 09:27.400
Gimel.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.300
Your way is right,
and our way is wrong.

09:30.300 --> 09:31.300
Oh, not wrong,

09:31.300 --> 09:32.567
just specific,

09:32.567 --> 09:36.700
and specificity be
the enemy of unity.

09:36.700 --> 09:38.667
Now, let us all join
in a traditional

09:38.667 --> 09:40.367
all religions are equally valid

09:40.367 --> 09:42.967
Snowflake Day celebratory
cabbage patch.

09:42.967 --> 09:44.833
[upbeat dance music playing]

09:44.833 --> 09:45.833
[laughs]

09:45.833 --> 09:48.600
*

09:48.600 --> 09:52.367
Ugh, I can't believe you guys
watch that Snowflake Day crap.

09:52.367 --> 09:53.633
[gunshot]

09:53.633 --> 09:56.400
Now, I may be blind,
but I can still see

09:56.400 --> 09:58.867
you're losing your
Snowflake Day spirit, girl.

09:58.867 --> 10:00.433
You know Snowflake Jake
might not shoot

10:00.433 --> 10:01.700
a spice cannonball
at our party

10:01.700 --> 10:03.267
if you continue to act
so ill-mannered.

10:03.267 --> 10:04.500
Who cares?

10:04.500 --> 10:06.733
I'm not going
to the stupid party, anyway.

10:06.733 --> 10:09.467
But my presence will be felt.

10:09.467 --> 10:10.633
Oh, oh, yes.

10:10.633 --> 10:11.633
Oh, yes.

10:11.633 --> 10:14.300
My presence will be felt.

10:14.300 --> 10:16.200
But you have to come
to my party.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.300
You're serving the crackers.

10:18.300 --> 10:20.200
Where else am I gonna get
a cracker girl

10:20.200 --> 10:22.433
at this late hour?

10:22.433 --> 10:25.433
Uh, 4th and Maple?

10:26.667 --> 10:27.833
Oh, Lance.

10:27.833 --> 10:30.467
This music sure is
putting me in the mood.

10:30.467 --> 10:31.967
Of course it is.

10:31.967 --> 10:35.567
It's JFK sings the, er, uh,
Snowflake Day hits!

10:35.567 --> 10:39.500
* Away in a taco

10:39.500 --> 10:44.067
* No spice for my lamb

10:44.067 --> 10:45.867
* Snowflake, snowflake,
snowflake *

10:45.867 --> 10:48.333
* I made you out of snow

10:48.333 --> 10:50.767
* Jerky balls,
jerky balls *

10:50.767 --> 10:52.967
* Jerky, beef jerky

10:52.967 --> 10:56.333
* Jerky balls

10:56.333 --> 10:59.600
* Tasty balls

10:59.600 --> 11:03.233
* Balls of meat

11:03.233 --> 11:06.333
* Jerked so sweet

11:06.333 --> 11:11.800
* It's the Jeff Foxworthy
redneck Snowflake Day *

11:11.800 --> 11:13.067
More brandy, dear?

11:13.067 --> 11:14.067
No, thanks.

11:14.067 --> 11:15.733
I'm pregnant.

11:15.733 --> 11:18.533
(JFK)
Get your albums here!

11:18.533 --> 11:19.533
See, dude?

11:19.533 --> 11:20.900
That's called marketing.

11:20.900 --> 11:22.600
Marketing brings the coin.

11:22.600 --> 11:25.567
Marketing, eh?

11:27.533 --> 11:29.433
(Gandhi)
Ladies and gentlemen,

11:29.433 --> 11:31.300
witness the miracle utensil

11:31.300 --> 11:34.600
that's sweeping
the exotic nation of Europe.

11:34.600 --> 11:35.600
You, ma'am!

11:35.600 --> 11:37.100
Why are you all deformed?

11:37.100 --> 11:40.667
Oh, it's the saddest story,
medical expert.

11:40.667 --> 11:42.633
I have this hideous deformity

11:42.633 --> 11:45.867
from hunching over a plate
using two utensils

11:45.867 --> 11:48.867
for lo these many years--

11:48.867 --> 11:51.133
a knife and fork.

11:51.133 --> 11:53.067
Ma'am, have you ever
tried a knork?

11:53.067 --> 11:54.133
A what?

11:54.133 --> 11:55.133
Knork-knork!

11:55.133 --> 11:56.133
Who's there?

11:56.133 --> 11:57.133
A knork!

11:57.133 --> 11:59.067
Half knife, half fork.

11:59.067 --> 12:02.433
That would cut
my silverware budget in half.

12:02.433 --> 12:05.067
Not to mention
the toughest beef brisket.

12:05.067 --> 12:07.333
I can walk again!

12:07.333 --> 12:10.433
I say, let us all
purchase this miracle.

12:10.433 --> 12:12.367
I agree with the dandy!

12:12.367 --> 12:13.633
Great device.

12:13.633 --> 12:15.167
There seems to be a lot
of buzz about this.

12:15.167 --> 12:16.167
That's quite a unit.

12:16.167 --> 12:18.333
Why, even a child can use it.

12:18.333 --> 12:20.233
Come here, giant boy.

12:20.233 --> 12:22.533
Just pump the gas valve
with your foot there,

12:22.533 --> 12:23.767
pull out the choke,

12:23.767 --> 12:26.467
and like magic,
the knork begins to--

12:26.467 --> 12:28.067
[screaming]

12:28.067 --> 12:29.533
Oh, I think it hit
an artery!

12:29.533 --> 12:30.933
[saw buzzing]

12:30.933 --> 12:33.300
Oh, God!
It's inside me now.

12:33.300 --> 12:36.233
[screaming]

12:40.900 --> 12:43.067
Joanie, are you putting
itching powder

12:43.067 --> 12:44.500
into the eye patches?

12:45.967 --> 12:48.633
I may be blind,
but I can still tell

12:48.633 --> 12:52.333
when somebody's trying
to sabotage Snowflake Day.

12:52.333 --> 12:54.100
I hate Snowflake Day.

12:54.100 --> 12:55.800
[gunshots]

12:55.800 --> 12:57.300
Congratulations, Joan.

12:57.300 --> 12:58.933
You just got yourself
a one-way ticket

12:58.933 --> 13:01.533
to Snowflake Jake's
ill-mannered list.

13:01.533 --> 13:05.233
Your behavior
is an embarrass--oh!

13:05.233 --> 13:07.300
Remember when you were a kid
and you used to do

13:07.300 --> 13:09.500
your traditional
cabbage patching?

13:09.500 --> 13:11.133
Cabbage patch
with us, Joanie.

13:11.133 --> 13:12.133
Come on!

13:12.133 --> 13:13.967
No, I hate this family.

13:13.967 --> 13:16.700
I'm running away
and never coming back!

13:16.700 --> 13:17.700
[Joan crying]

13:17.700 --> 13:18.700
[door slams]

13:18.700 --> 13:20.400
That's the spirit, Joanie.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.667
You sure can cabbage patch.

13:22.667 --> 13:25.200
Mm!
That's right.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.533
Waaoow!

13:27.533 --> 13:30.667
She's lost her
Snowflake Day spirit.

13:30.667 --> 13:34.367
Sure as shooting,
she's lost it.

13:34.367 --> 13:36.300
(Toots)
Waaoow!

13:42.200 --> 13:44.433
(Principal Scudworth)
And after 52 hours,

13:44.433 --> 13:48.433
I finally passed the stone,
and in the end,

13:48.433 --> 13:54.067
isn't that what Snowflake Day
is really about?

13:54.067 --> 13:56.567
[crying]

13:56.567 --> 13:57.867
(woman)
Hello, Joan.

13:57.867 --> 13:58.967
Oh, it's you,

13:58.967 --> 14:00.967
that sexy dumpster teen.

14:00.967 --> 14:02.400
I know you're
running away from home

14:02.400 --> 14:04.233
after sabotaging
Cleo's party.

14:04.233 --> 14:06.967
It's just that I hate her,
and she's dating the boy I love,

14:06.967 --> 14:08.167
and I have to live with her

14:08.167 --> 14:09.700
because me and Toots'
house burned down,

14:09.700 --> 14:11.200
and I hate her.

14:11.200 --> 14:12.200
Wait.

14:12.200 --> 14:13.367
How did you know that?

14:13.367 --> 14:17.367
I...can see it in your heart.

14:17.367 --> 14:19.533
Joan, your family
misses you.

14:19.533 --> 14:21.300
They're worried about you.

14:21.300 --> 14:22.933
Joanie!

14:22.933 --> 14:24.433
Joanie!

14:24.433 --> 14:26.167
Come back home, girl.

14:26.167 --> 14:27.800
[roars]

14:27.800 --> 14:29.900
I knew you'd come back!

14:29.900 --> 14:31.233
That's a good Joanie.

14:31.233 --> 14:32.233
[roars]

14:32.233 --> 14:33.233
Ow!

14:33.233 --> 14:34.367
[laughs]
It's all right.

14:34.367 --> 14:35.367
I'm just happy you home.

14:35.367 --> 14:36.900
Now, follow me.

14:36.900 --> 14:38.067
I'll show you something

14:38.067 --> 14:40.667
about Snowflake Day
and yourself.

14:40.667 --> 14:42.233
I don't know.

14:42.233 --> 14:45.067
Toots told me I shouldn't let
homeless people show me things.

14:45.067 --> 14:46.467
Come with me,

14:46.467 --> 14:49.400
and I'll forever
change your life.

14:49.400 --> 14:50.933
Forever.

14:52.200 --> 14:53.633
Are you sure
you're not Mandy Moore?

14:53.633 --> 14:54.633
No.

14:54.633 --> 14:56.067
Seriously,
because you really--

14:56.067 --> 14:57.567
Get off my back, okay?

14:57.567 --> 14:58.567
Leave me alone.

14:58.567 --> 14:59.633
I already said no.

14:59.633 --> 15:01.567
Are you stupid
or something?

15:04.933 --> 15:07.567
You ruined my life, knork.

15:07.567 --> 15:08.900
Who would have thought

15:08.900 --> 15:11.067
a get-rich-quick scheme
wouldn't work?

15:11.067 --> 15:13.400
I told you we should've
made a spife.

15:13.400 --> 15:16.367
So you're out $20,000.

15:16.367 --> 15:19.400
Just make Cleo something
from your heart.

15:19.400 --> 15:26.800
(man)
* You shine on the birds
over land *

15:26.800 --> 15:31.300
* There my house will stand

15:31.300 --> 15:33.133
[snoring]

15:33.133 --> 15:40.733
* All my life,
I've been waiting *

15:40.733 --> 15:44.367
Heart, you've done it again.

15:45.567 --> 15:46.933
You took me to this dump

15:46.933 --> 15:49.467
to show me
the Snowflake Day spirit?

15:49.467 --> 15:51.300
This is no dump.

15:51.300 --> 15:54.467
It's your old house,
the one that burnt down.

15:54.467 --> 15:56.333
Welcome home, Joan.

15:56.333 --> 15:57.933
Welcome home.

15:57.933 --> 15:59.767
[sprightly music playing]

15:59.767 --> 16:01.133
Wow!

16:01.133 --> 16:03.200
I didn't know poor people
could have fun.

16:03.200 --> 16:06.333
They have the Snowflake Day
spirit, Joan.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.433
These people don't need
spices or silks

16:08.433 --> 16:11.600
or a balanced diet
to have the joy of the season.

16:11.600 --> 16:12.833
They just need each other.

16:12.833 --> 16:15.400
So you find
the Snowflake Day spirit

16:15.400 --> 16:17.300
when you hang out
with the homeless?

16:17.300 --> 16:18.867
Yes and no.

16:18.867 --> 16:21.400
More like you find it when you
hang out with your friends,

16:21.400 --> 16:23.267
be they homeless
or homed.

16:23.267 --> 16:25.300
My goodness, it's true.

16:25.300 --> 16:27.933
I've abandoned my family
and friends.

16:27.933 --> 16:31.667
I've slashed their tires
and urinated in their punch.

16:31.667 --> 16:33.333
I realize now,

16:33.333 --> 16:36.500
I've lost
the Snowflake Day spirit.

16:36.500 --> 16:39.367
Sure as shooting,
I've lost it.

16:39.367 --> 16:41.900
[people conversing indistinctly]

16:41.900 --> 16:47.067
Someone slipped laxatives
into these lamb tacos.

16:47.067 --> 16:48.600
[people gasp]

16:48.600 --> 16:49.967
Oh, my God, you guys.

16:49.967 --> 16:53.900
And someone put goat's blood
on the doorjamb.

16:53.900 --> 16:54.900
[roars]

16:54.900 --> 16:55.900
Bad Joanie!

16:55.900 --> 16:56.933
Bad, bad, bad Joanie!

16:56.933 --> 16:58.400
First you sabotage the party,

16:58.400 --> 17:00.500
and now you chewed through
my Achilles tendon,

17:00.500 --> 17:03.067
and you know my Achilles tendon
is my one Achilles' heel.

17:03.067 --> 17:04.300
[glass tinkling]

17:04.300 --> 17:07.200
Everyone, it is now time
for the traditional

17:07.200 --> 17:10.067
Snowflake care satchel exchange!

17:10.067 --> 17:14.233
Cleo, we've been together
for a long time,

17:14.233 --> 17:16.633
almost four weeks,

17:16.633 --> 17:18.800
and that's why I wanted
to give you this.

17:18.800 --> 17:19.967
[gasps]

17:19.967 --> 17:20.967
Ugh!

17:20.967 --> 17:23.367
It's a love coupon book!

17:23.367 --> 17:25.533
One free snuggle,
one back rub.

17:25.533 --> 17:27.667
See, that's your
silhouette in macaroni,

17:27.667 --> 17:28.933
and those pipe cleaners are--

17:28.933 --> 17:30.733
I'm confused.

17:30.733 --> 17:32.933
Why didn't you just
buy me something expensive?

17:32.933 --> 17:36.500
But I stayed up all night
making this.

17:36.500 --> 17:37.933
Well, you should have
stayed up all night

17:37.933 --> 17:40.167
buying me
an expensive present.

17:40.167 --> 17:42.067
Now, I'm not sure
if you deserve this,

17:42.067 --> 17:43.333
but here.

17:45.333 --> 17:47.500
A knork?

17:47.500 --> 17:49.067
A knork?

17:49.067 --> 17:51.533
I got it at the Sharper Image.

17:51.533 --> 17:53.700
Lies!

17:53.700 --> 17:56.600
You just pulled this
out of the garbage.

17:56.600 --> 18:00.933
This dump gift had absolutely
no thought or meaning!

18:00.933 --> 18:02.900
Well, you didn't say
what you wanted!

18:02.900 --> 18:05.367
I clearly stated
that I wanted something

18:05.367 --> 18:09.167
that was, A, expensive,
B, bought,

18:09.167 --> 18:12.833
and, C, not lovingly
hand-crafted!

18:12.833 --> 18:15.233
I see.

18:15.233 --> 18:20.100
I guess you're not the person
I thought you were.

18:20.100 --> 18:25.233
I'm going to get
some bite-size wieners now.

18:25.233 --> 18:27.700
Bite-sized wieners!

18:27.700 --> 18:28.700
[chewing]

18:28.700 --> 18:30.700
Oh, God!
Oh!

18:30.700 --> 18:33.700
Who put razor blades in these?

18:33.700 --> 18:36.933
Why does my mouth
keep getting cut up?

18:36.933 --> 18:39.067
Why?

18:39.067 --> 18:40.333
[people gasp]

18:40.333 --> 18:41.700
(both)
Homeless!

18:41.700 --> 18:44.200
I'm back, family and friends.

18:44.200 --> 18:47.400
Joanie, I thought
you were dead.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.867
I shot you
for biting me so much.

18:49.867 --> 18:51.533
Oh, Toots.

18:51.533 --> 18:56.467
Everyone, I've got something
really important to say.

18:56.467 --> 18:57.700
Don't drink the punch.

18:57.700 --> 18:58.933
[slurps]

18:58.933 --> 19:01.433
These derelicts taught me
something today.

19:01.433 --> 19:03.600
Snowflake Day is not
about greediness

19:03.600 --> 19:05.267
or ruining parties.

19:05.267 --> 19:07.667
It's about being
with friends and family

19:07.667 --> 19:09.667
and realizing what you've got.

19:09.667 --> 19:11.067
[crowd murmuring]

19:11.067 --> 19:12.933
(JFK)
This punch is amazing!

19:12.933 --> 19:14.400
You know what, Abe?

19:14.400 --> 19:17.433
It doesn't matter that you
got me a crappy present.

19:17.433 --> 19:20.667
I'm happy to have you
as a backup gift,

19:20.667 --> 19:23.300
and I'll give you
your backup present later.

19:23.300 --> 19:24.300
You mean...

19:24.300 --> 19:25.500
That's right.

19:25.500 --> 19:28.067
I'm gonna show you
my left boob.

19:28.067 --> 19:31.433
Oh, Poncho,
finally we will meet.

19:31.433 --> 19:33.533
Now, new friends and old,

19:33.533 --> 19:36.967
let us unite
and celebrate Snowflake Day!

19:36.967 --> 19:40.300
Everyone, cabbage patch!

19:40.300 --> 19:43.300
[upbeat dance music playing]

19:43.300 --> 19:44.300
Hark!

19:44.300 --> 19:46.200
Snowflake Jake is nigh!

19:46.200 --> 19:48.267
I can hear his cannonballs
a-coming!

19:48.267 --> 19:49.533
He is real!

19:49.533 --> 19:50.967
He is real!

19:50.967 --> 19:53.600
Step away from the target,
or you'll get hit.

19:53.600 --> 19:55.400
Everyone into the basement.

19:55.400 --> 19:56.967
Hurry it up now.
In you go.

19:56.967 --> 19:58.433
(Joan)
To the basement!

19:58.433 --> 19:59.333

Can you believe
it's Snowflake Jake?

19:59.333 --> 20:00.333
(JFK)
I wished for curry!

20:00.333 --> 20:01.600
Look, everyone!

20:01.600 --> 20:03.600
It's snowing outside!

20:03.600 --> 20:06.267
Hey, where'd
that hot homeless chick

20:06.267 --> 20:08.667
who may or may not
have been Mandy Moore go?

20:08.667 --> 20:10.333
- I don't know.
- Maybe she had a gig.

20:10.333 --> 20:11.800
She just disappeared.

20:11.800 --> 20:15.000
So she wasn't Mandy Moore.

20:15.000 --> 20:19.967
She was angel,
an angel all along.

20:19.967 --> 20:23.100
Well, jolly
Snowflake Day, angel.

20:23.100 --> 20:25.633
Jolly Snowflake Day, everyone!

20:25.633 --> 20:29.300
(all)
Jolly Snowflake Day, everyone!

21:01.533 --> 21:04.200
