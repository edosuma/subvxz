a couple days later.

10:03.603 --> 10:04.729
Oh!

10:04.812 --> 10:07.940

in his life boring.

10:12.278 --> 10:13.904
-Do you?
-Oh!

10:14.447 --> 10:17.158
-Would anyone like some pie?
-Yes! I would.

10:17.241 --> 10:19.827
Jo Ellen, would you be a doll
and grab us a slice?

10:19.910 --> 10:20.995
I suppose.

10:21.078 --> 10:22.455
Oh, and two forks?

10:22.538 --> 10:23.748
-Sure.
-Thank you.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.917
You looked like
you needed a bit of saving.

10:27.001 --> 10:29.003

till she took a breath,

10:29.086 --> 10:32.173

10:34.925 --> 10:35.843
You okay?

10:36.344 --> 10:39.388
Oh, yeah. Uh, yeah, just a minor headache.

10:39.472 --> 10:42.308
Well, you have been
under a tremendous amount of stress.

10:42.391 --> 10:45.144
I mean, first with Jack
and then Hope abandoning you.

10:45.227 --> 10:48.356
-It's--
-She is visiting her octogenarian aunt.

10:48.439 --> 10:51.150
-Yes, and that is exactly what I meant.
-[laughs] Yes.

10:51.233 --> 10:54.195
Anyway, you should go home.

10:54.278 --> 10:57.239
-Ricky will understand.
-No, no, no. I'm fine.

10:58.282 --> 10:59.700
-You sure?
-Yeah.

Oh, no, you don't need to do that.

14:08.222 --> 14:10.432
Did you just say that? [laughs]

14:10.516 --> 14:12.101
Uh, okay.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.436
So, how did you guys meet?

14:14.520 --> 14:16.981
-It was about a month ago.
-It's more like three weeks.

14:17.064 --> 14:21.986
Right. And he came into the salon
for a haircut and sat in my chair.

14:22.069 --> 14:24.446
-Isn't that wild?
-Well, not if you need a haircut.

14:25.114 --> 14:27.074
I've got a personal barber in Eureka,

14:27.157 --> 14:31.245
but I bought a property in Clear River,
and I decided to check out Char's salon.

14:31.328 --> 14:34.540
Yeah. It's fate.
I wasn't supposed to be working that day.

14:35.124 --> 14:36.584

14:36.667 --> 14:38.586
It is, and actually,

I wasn't gonna say anything
because it's Ricky's party, but…

Come on, Joe.
You know that birthdays aren't my thing.

Just because Dad didn't care about them
doesn't mean that we shouldn't.

15:52.159 --> 15:55.537
Last year I went to Paris for my birthday
and broke my AmEx.

Literally. A card with no limit.

make a big deal about it, you know?

-I thought you'd still be in bed.

16:32.908 --> 16:34.159
I have work. Remember?

16:34.243 --> 16:37.329
-You're really going to the clinic?
-Yeah, I told you that yesterday.

16:37.413 --> 16:40.874
-Oh, I didn't think you were serious.
-To me, it's just another day.

Why don't you wanna celebrate?

you're not coming in today.

22:11.038 --> 22:11.872
Why is that?

22:11.955 --> 22:14.333
Medicine is a very competitive market
right now.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.711
This is a thriving practice,

22:17.794 --> 22:21.631
and you get to treat a variety of ailments
without any of the bureaucracy.

22:21.715 --> 22:24.634
Well, most doctors aren't looking
to practice country medicine.

22:24.718 --> 22:26.011
[laughs]

22:26.094 --> 22:29.348
And why not? We got no traffic.
People are as friendly as all get-out.

22:29.431 --> 22:31.391
Big cities have more to offer.

22:32.017 --> 22:33.518
Such as?

22:33.602 --> 22:35.729
Competitive salaries, perks…

22:36.521 --> 22:38.357
What kind of perks are we talking about?

22:38.440 --> 22:41.109
Signing bonuses
and country club memberships.

22:41.193 --> 22:44.237
[laughs] That's ridiculous.

22:45.030 --> 22:46.281
It's the market.

22:46.365 --> 22:50.577
Well, I believe
this place just sells itself.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.373
[gentle instrumental music playing]

23:09.012 --> 23:12.099
[Jack] Okay. Keep your eyes closed.
I'm not kidding.

23:12.182 --> 23:13.767
Okay. [chuckles]

23:14.768 --> 23:15.977
No peeking.

23:17.854 --> 23:18.855
Open your eyes.

23:20.023 --> 23:21.108
[gasps]

23:22.192 --> 23:25.112
-What? You got me sushi?
-Mm-hmm.

23:26.321 --> 23:28.281
Thank you!

23:28.365 --> 23:29.408
You're welcome.

23:29.491 --> 23:31.660
I didn't know
there was a sushi restaurant nearby.

23:31.743 --> 23:34.538
Well, there's not.
The closest place is in Grace Valley.

23:35.831 --> 23:36.915
That's two hours away.

23:36.998 --> 23:39.501
Hm, not if you have a friend
who's a bush pilot.

23:39.584 --> 23:42.212
-[Mel chuckles]
-He flew it in while you had your massage.

23:43.630 --> 23:47.509
Oh my gosh. I-- This is so incredible.
I don't even know what to say.

23:47.592 --> 23:50.178
I had Joey send me a list
of your favorite rolls, so…

23:50.262 --> 23:54.057
It's perfect and amazing. Thank you.

23:55.559 --> 23:57.894
You went overboard. [laughs]

23:57.978 --> 24:02.274
Well, us Sheridans believe that birthdays
are the greatest day of the year.

24:02.357 --> 24:03.525
Why is that?

24:03.608 --> 24:06.153
'Cause holidays you gotta share
with everybody else,

24:06.236 --> 24:08.363
but your birthday is just for you.

24:08.947 --> 24:10.532
Hm. [inhales]

24:10.615 --> 24:14.619
-Birthdays were never a thing in my house.
-Is that why you don't celebrate them?

24:14.703 --> 24:17.706
Mr. Sheridan, I did not take you
for someone who digs for information.

24:17.789 --> 24:19.749
I believe that that is Hope's department.

24:19.833 --> 24:23.295
I've never dated anybody who hasn't wanted
to celebrate their birthday.

24:23.378 --> 24:25.547
Usually, there's a ton of pressure
to do something big.

24:25.630 --> 24:26.965
I guess I'm unique.

24:27.048 --> 24:28.049
That you are.

24:30.969 --> 24:33.930
I'm constantly
pleasantly surprised by you.

24:34.014 --> 24:35.932
I like to keep you on your toes.

24:37.350 --> 24:38.643
Try this.

24:39.811 --> 24:40.770
[Mel hums]

24:43.064 --> 24:44.483
-Mmm.
-Oh, that's pretty good.

24:44.566 --> 24:46.318
Mm-hmm? It's delicious.

24:47.444 --> 24:48.820
So, um,

24:49.613 --> 24:52.824
that was a pretty big bombshell
Charmaine dropped.

24:52.908 --> 24:54.367
[Jack scoffs] Yeah.

24:54.451 --> 24:59.289
You know, I can't figure out
whether she's serious about the guy,

25:00.040 --> 25:01.750
or trying to get a rise out of me.

25:01.833 --> 25:03.502
Either way, he's not her type.

25:04.002 --> 25:07.589
Well, he seems to really like her,
and he's successful.

25:07.672 --> 25:10.008
No, Charmaine doesn't care about money.

25:11.009 --> 25:14.346
I'm gonna talk to her. I don't want
some bozo hanging around the twins.

25:14.429 --> 25:17.015
I think that's a little premature,
don't you?

25:17.098 --> 25:20.143
Right now, they can't see him,
but they can hear him.

25:20.227 --> 25:21.770
That doesn't work for me.

25:22.979 --> 25:25.899
Anyway, what do you wanna do for dinner?

25:27.984 --> 25:32.280
I don't know. Just meet back here.
Maybe bring something from the bar?

25:32.364 --> 25:34.658
-Sure you don't want to go out?
-I'm positive.

25:34.741 --> 25:37.869
As long as I get my cupcake
and my bubble bath, I will be happy.

25:39.663 --> 25:40.539
Okay.

25:42.916 --> 25:44.167
Can I have another piece?

25:44.960 --> 25:45.919
Try this.

26:09.901 --> 26:12.654
-The hell you doing here?
-Come to deliver a message.

26:14.531 --> 26:16.074
Nobody likes a snitch.

26:16.866 --> 26:18.910
I had nothing to do with the raid.

26:18.994 --> 26:19.828
Really?

26:20.954 --> 26:23.206
So, you're not responsible
for flipping Spencer?

26:24.791 --> 26:28.086
You know, if not for a loyal employee,
I'd be in jail right now.

26:28.169 --> 26:30.505
[chuckles] Were you surprised…

26:31.464 --> 26:32.674
[laughs]

26:32.757 --> 26:36.303
…when your police friend showed up,
and there was no drugs, no money?

26:36.386 --> 26:37.387
'Cause they were.

26:38.305 --> 26:40.265
Look, if you're gonna kill me, just do it.

26:40.348 --> 26:42.809
In time. My time.

26:42.892 --> 26:45.562
And when I do,
unlike Spencer, you'll stay dead.

26:47.063 --> 26:50.567
On the plus side, I guess you did try
to make up for everything,

26:50.650 --> 26:52.485
considering what happened to Jack.

26:54.487 --> 26:56.489
I want you to remember something.

26:56.573 --> 27:00.076
Someday soon, these law enforcement types
are gonna go back home,

27:01.995 --> 27:03.413
and I'll still be here.

27:14.674 --> 27:17.802
[Lilly] Here we go, girl.
Come on. One more. There we go.

27:19.012 --> 27:20.055
Hey, Lilly.

27:20.138 --> 27:21.097
Hi!

27:21.181 --> 27:22.682
Hey, how are you?

27:22.766 --> 27:23.850
Happy birthday!

27:23.933 --> 27:26.061
Oh, yeah, thank you.

27:26.144 --> 27:29.773
I just keep forgetting that Brie
told the whole town it's my birthday.

27:29.856 --> 27:31.816
Hard to keep a secret in Virgin River.

27:31.900 --> 27:33.068
So true.

27:33.777 --> 27:35.945
-So, how are you? Is everything okay?
-Mm-hmm.

27:36.029 --> 27:39.658
Yeah. Tara's great.
Chloe is growing like a weed.

27:39.741 --> 27:42.118
So, do you and Jack
have any big plans for tonight?

27:42.202 --> 27:46.164
Oh, no. I told him I didn't want
to do anything big for my birthday.

27:46.247 --> 27:49.876
You know, that's how I was
until Buck and I got married.

27:49.959 --> 27:51.461
Buck believed that every birthday

27:51.544 --> 27:53.838
was a day to celebrate
the gift of being born

27:53.922 --> 27:56.091
and give thanks
for another year well-lived.

27:56.174 --> 27:58.426
Grateful we had
a lot of wonderful celebrations together.

27:59.469 --> 28:03.014
Whatever it is you do tonight with Jack,
I hope you enjoy yourself.

28:03.098 --> 28:04.182
Thank you.

28:05.350 --> 28:07.602
-Bye.
-Come on, little one. Here we go.

28:14.526 --> 28:16.611
[Joey] You did such a beautiful job
in here.

28:16.695 --> 28:17.696
Mm-hmm.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.907
-Do you think she's gonna like it?
-Yeah.

28:20.990 --> 28:24.285
I mean, you know, until she's 12,
and then she'll want to paint it black.

28:24.369 --> 28:25.787
[laughs]

28:27.664 --> 28:30.500
Hm. I can't wait to meet her.

28:31.918 --> 28:34.170
See who she is, who she'll become.

28:35.255 --> 28:37.424
That is the thing about becoming a mom.

28:37.507 --> 28:40.093
You get the privilege
of watching your child grow up.

28:40.176 --> 28:41.636
It changes your outlook on life.

28:43.179 --> 28:45.223
Hm. For the better?

28:45.849 --> 28:47.392
You can't even imagine.

29:01.990 --> 29:03.283
Uh, headaches?

29:04.033 --> 29:05.869
A few, but they ain't that bad.

29:05.952 --> 29:06.870
Yeah?

29:06.953 --> 29:08.288
Dizziness?

29:08.371 --> 29:09.205
No.

29:09.289 --> 29:10.206
Yeah?

29:10.290 --> 29:12.041
-Sleeping?
-Yeah, pretty good.

29:12.125 --> 29:13.126
Let's take a look.

29:13.209 --> 29:15.336
[Jack inhales deeply, groans]

29:16.921 --> 29:19.215
That surgeon did a very nice job.

29:20.341 --> 29:22.051
Looking good. Can you sit up?

29:24.095 --> 29:27.724
[sighs] How much longer will I have to
keep getting these checkups?

29:27.807 --> 29:31.227
Well, you have been cleared
by the doctors in Grace Valley,

29:31.311 --> 29:34.689
but, with your memory issues,
I just wanna keep an eye on you.

29:35.815 --> 29:37.275
Yeah, whoever shot me,

29:38.234 --> 29:39.903
it's right here. You know, it's--

29:41.529 --> 29:42.405
But I can't recall.

29:42.489 --> 29:43.531
Our brains protect us

29:43.615 --> 29:46.201
by wiping out memories
of traumatic events.

29:46.284 --> 29:47.869
Well, I'm gonna keep trying.

29:47.952 --> 29:48.870
Look.

29:49.662 --> 29:51.748
Mike is here. Sheriff's on it.

29:51.831 --> 29:54.375
You just need to be patient
and focus on your recovery.

29:56.044 --> 30:00.131
Anyway, what have you got planned
for Mel's big night?

30:00.799 --> 30:02.383
Dinner from the bar.

30:03.760 --> 30:05.136
-On her birthday?
-Mm-hmm.

30:05.220 --> 30:07.514
[laughs] Oh, you are a gambling man!

30:07.597 --> 30:09.766
She said
she didn't want to do anything, so…

30:11.351 --> 30:12.727
-[Doc sighs]
-What?

30:13.478 --> 30:14.938
[hesitates] In my experience,

30:15.021 --> 30:18.191
when a woman tells you
not to bother doing something,

30:18.274 --> 30:20.819
that means you had absolutely
better do something,

30:20.902 --> 30:22.362
or there's gonna be hell to pay.

30:22.445 --> 30:24.405
I honestly don't think Mel's like that.

30:24.489 --> 30:28.368
Yeah, I'll give you that,
but you have had a few rough weeks.

30:28.952 --> 30:31.246
-So?
-Maybe it's not about what she wants.

30:31.329 --> 30:33.748
Maybe she doesn't want you
to have to do anything.

30:38.878 --> 30:41.673
[cell phone rings]

30:44.676 --> 30:45.593
[sighs]

30:48.096 --> 30:49.013
Hello?

30:51.975 --> 30:54.602
I honestly don't care
what you do with my stuff.

30:57.063 --> 31:00.483
Look, throw everything in the trash,
or don't. Just stop calling me.

31:01.651 --> 31:02.569
[phone beeps]

31:06.155 --> 31:07.156
[door opens]

31:09.117 --> 31:10.118
[sighs]

31:10.201 --> 31:11.077
[door closes]

31:25.049 --> 31:26.885
[clears throat] You meeting someone?

31:26.968 --> 31:29.929
Uh, no, just looking for Jack.

31:30.930 --> 31:32.181
He owns the place.

31:32.265 --> 31:33.808
Yeah, I know who Jack is.

31:33.892 --> 31:34.976
You do, do you?

31:35.059 --> 31:36.936
Yeah. We actually used to live together.

31:37.020 --> 31:37.896
Really?

31:38.521 --> 31:41.691
I don't remember Jack
ever living with a woman before.

31:41.774 --> 31:44.319
-Well, I guess I'm the exception.
-[chuckles softly]

31:45.236 --> 31:46.738
So, what's your secret?

31:46.821 --> 31:50.742
[Brie] Hmm, well,
some say I'm irresistible.

31:50.825 --> 31:52.952
[Brady] You know, I'm getting that.

31:53.036 --> 31:54.329
Can I buy you a drink?

31:54.412 --> 31:55.830
[Jack] That'd be a no.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.749
Hey, speak for yourself.

31:58.333 --> 31:59.250
You can leave.

32:00.710 --> 32:01.794
Give me a minute.

32:12.221 --> 32:13.056
Hey.

32:14.432 --> 32:15.892
-You look good.
-Calvin send you?

32:15.975 --> 32:18.353
No. Calvin and I are done.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.814
Well, that's convenient,
now that he's out of business.

32:23.441 --> 32:27.153
Look, I, uh… I just came by
to see how you're doing.

32:27.737 --> 32:29.072
I'm doing fine, thanks.

32:29.906 --> 32:30.990
You can go now.

32:32.784 --> 32:34.118
I heard you lost your memory.

32:35.244 --> 32:36.287
That's a bummer.

32:37.497 --> 32:39.916
Must be frustrating
not remembering what happened.

32:39.999 --> 32:41.334
Brady, what are you after?

32:41.918 --> 32:45.588
It's just-- You know, it's been a while
since we've seen each other.

32:46.422 --> 32:47.256
Yeah.

32:48.216 --> 32:49.050
What's your point?

32:50.635 --> 32:51.469
Nothing.

32:52.303 --> 32:53.262
Look, I'm just--

32:54.514 --> 32:56.182
I'm glad you're back on your feet.

32:57.100 --> 32:59.268
All right. I'll get out of your way.

33:04.107 --> 33:04.983
[scoffs]

33:07.485 --> 33:08.569
Hey.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.532
-[camp counselor] You're good.
-Thanks.

33:13.116 --> 33:15.576
Hey! Looks like someone had a good day.

33:15.660 --> 33:18.454
So, what was your favorite thing?
Archery? Swimming?

33:19.622 --> 33:20.832
Who'd you have lunch with?

33:21.749 --> 33:23.876
No one. I hate it. I'm never going back.

33:30.550 --> 33:31.551
[soft groaning]

33:31.634 --> 33:34.345
-Maybe I should pull around the corner?
-Nuh-uh.

33:34.429 --> 33:36.014
It's just really bright out--

33:36.097 --> 33:37.515
-[car horn beeps]
-[Lizzie laughs]

33:38.016 --> 33:39.892
There's no way Connie didn't hear that.

33:39.976 --> 33:41.728
-We gotta get out of here.
-Stop! Stop.

33:41.811 --> 33:43.813
-[motor starts]
-Listen to me.

33:43.896 --> 33:46.274
You are literally driving me insane.

33:46.357 --> 33:48.735
Your obsession with Connie
is ruining everything.

33:48.818 --> 33:51.779
I'm sorry, but I'm the one
who was caught in my underwear!

33:51.863 --> 33:53.406
[groans] You need to let that go.

33:53.489 --> 33:56.617
-It's not like it went viral.
-Connie is viral enough!

33:56.701 --> 33:59.245
Taking risks
is what makes life interesting.

33:59.328 --> 34:02.206
If you don't know that by now,
I can't help you.

34:02.290 --> 34:03.249
Where are you going?

34:04.250 --> 34:07.420
Home. So you don't have to worry
about Connie anymore.

34:07.962 --> 34:09.964
[gentle instrumental music playing]

34:18.347 --> 34:19.640
[knock at door]

34:26.939 --> 34:28.399
[chuckles] What's going on?

34:28.483 --> 34:30.151
A little change of plans.

34:30.234 --> 34:35.198
I have two tickets
to a moonlight dinner cruise in Eureka.

34:35.281 --> 34:37.742

you're gonna need a jacket,

is why we are going on one.

Jack, you've already done way too much.

34:53.091 --> 34:54.801
I'm just trying to make you happy.

34:55.468 --> 34:57.178
Well, I don't need to go out.

34:58.012 --> 34:59.806

35:04.185 --> 35:05.103
Okay.

35:05.895 --> 35:10.191
All right. So say we stay in,
then next year we do the same thing,

35:10.274 --> 35:12.985
you're gonna start thinking
that I'm taking you for granted,

35:13.069 --> 35:15.196
and I don't care enough to plan something.

35:15.988 --> 35:17.073
Jack, you--

35:17.156 --> 35:20.451
You're having a fake argument
with someone who isn't me.

I will tell you.

I made you vegetable lasagna.

-Oh.
-Already baked.

All you have to do is warm it
for ten minutes, and it'll be ready to go.

I miss my mom.

I'm so sorry that she's not here.

37:37.797 --> 37:41.717
But, you know,
I don't know how to play Fortnite either,

37:41.801 --> 37:45.471
so, uh…
Okay, so maybe we could teach each other?

37:46.305 --> 37:48.641
You don't have an Xbox or PlayStation.

37:48.724 --> 37:50.810
Well, maybe we should get one.

37:50.893 --> 37:52.311
That would be awesome.

you find someone else
who feels the same way

and, well, you end up being best friends.

38:10.079 --> 38:11.372

Yeah.

Yeah, I met Jack,
when I joined the Marines.

But Marines are tough.

38:18.337 --> 38:20.756
Well, you can be tough and feel alone.

38:21.716 --> 38:25.386
So, if I go back to camp tomorrow,
I might make a best friend like you did?

38:25.469 --> 38:26.429
Absolutely.

38:26.929 --> 38:28.931
I'll try that. Night, Preach.
