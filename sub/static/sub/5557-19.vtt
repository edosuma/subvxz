>>> it's are good to see you.
Let's talk about last night.

00:46.353 --> 00:50.889
Every single one of our artists
hit the top on the i tunes and

00:51.024 --> 00:55.794
Three were in the top 10.
And we'll see if that was enough

00:55.929 --> 00:58.263
To beat them.
Blake and pharrell will each

00:58.398 --> 01:01.734
Take the stage with their teams.
Plus, you will get to instantly

01:01.868 --> 01:11.443

01:27.260 --> 01:38.037

Good to see you.

01:38.171 --> 01:42.541
I have a few questions for our
artists tonight.

01:42.675 --> 01:46.445
And we'll get your results in a
second but first a question to

01:46.579 --> 01:52.684
Amy.
Adam stole you in the knockout

01:52.819 --> 01:55.521
And then saved you in the
playoff.

01:55.655 --> 02:00.559
What has adam's support meant to
you, amy?

02:00.693 --> 02:04.263
>> he's shown me such grace and
the thing about grace is you

02:04.397 --> 02:10.369
Don't feel like you deserve it
but it just makes you ask you

02:10.502 --> 02:14.173
Know, how are you kgoing to
respond and how i honestly

02:14.307 --> 02:19.111
Feelality this moment is that
having someone like adam, a true

02:19.245 --> 02:24.083
Hero of mine in so many ways,
believe in me, just makes me

02:24.217 --> 02:28.353
Want to stretch at the edge of
my abilities for the sake of

02:28.488 --> 02:34.059
Connecting to other people
because that's what it's all

02:34.194 --> 02:38.931
About.
>> hopefully you'll have the

02:39.065 --> 02:46.171
Opportunity to do it.
Barrett, what is your nfamily's

02:46.306 --> 02:50.275
Support mean to you?
>> my family's dream is mine.

02:50.410 --> 02:54.880
They're one in the same.
So, this is the -- we're sharing

02:55.014 --> 03:01.820
Them here and really feel the ve
support from the crowd and

03:01.955 --> 03:05.190
Coaches is an amazing thing and
i'm proud to have them here no

03:05.325 --> 03:09.128
Matter what it holds.
>> in my hand is the names of

03:09.262 --> 03:21.807
The first two artists who are
safe in advancing to our top 11.

03:21.941 --> 03:47.266
Here we go.
America safe.

03:51.437 --> 03:57.242
From team adam -- jordan smith
is first in your top 11.

03:57.377 --> 04:02.848
[ applause ]
saved by america's votes.

04:02.982 --> 04:15.994
First coach with an artist
moving on.

04:16.129 --> 04:44.323
[ applause ]
america also saved from team

04:44.657 --> 04:46.658
Gwen -- jeffrey austin,
congratulations, you're moving

04:46.793 --> 04:51.630
On.
Both jordan and jeffrey moving

04:51.764 --> 04:54.633
On to the top 11.
[ applause ]

04:54.767 --> 04:58.704
Unfortunately, the rest of our
artists on stage still at risk

04:58.838 --> 05:05.210
Of being eliminated.
We're going to take our first

05:05.345 --> 05:24.029
Break and when we come back,
another artists will take the

05:47.320 --> 05:52.424
>> just make this pa of the
competition not feel like a

05:52.558 --> 05:55.494
Competition.
And try be as comfortable as

05:55.628 --> 05:59.431
Possible.
Because the moment you treat it

05:59.565 --> 06:04.536
For what it is, you can fall off
the rails.

06:04.671 --> 06:22.587
So, keep it cool, sing your
songs, do your thing.

06:22.722 --> 06:28.560
>> how proud are you?
>> from rehearsal to last night

06:28.695 --> 06:31.797
Was mind blowing to me.
Jeffrey blew me away, i didn't

06:31.931 --> 06:36.968
Know it was going to be that
good and it's so exciting to

06:37.103 --> 06:40.772
Watch them blossom before my
eyes and have some sort of

06:40.907 --> 06:45.444
Impact, so it's all good.
I'm so proud.

06:45.578 --> 06:49.815
>> there's pharrell, nice sun
glass, buddy.

06:49.949 --> 07:04.162
How you doing?
>> pharrell: Doing good.

07:04.297 --> 07:07.566
The only risk they took was
being themselves.

07:07.700 --> 07:11.770
Your only competition is you.
You try to be like someone else,

07:11.904 --> 07:16.608
The best you'll ever be is
second best and i think they

07:16.743 --> 07:21.780
Took that with them in their
performances.

07:21.914 --> 07:26.885
I'm really proud of them.
>> blake shelton, everybody all

07:27.019 --> 07:31.723
Did great.
What do you hope america saw in

07:31.858 --> 07:35.427
Your team last night?
>> blake: I hope they saw that

07:35.561 --> 07:38.964
There's potential for all three
of them, not only on this stage

07:39.098 --> 07:43.568
But after the voice.
That's what i think we all look

07:43.703 --> 07:48.907
For when we bring somebody to
the live is who do we think can

07:49.041 --> 07:54.112
Have a career moving forward
after this show whether they win

07:54.247 --> 07:57.215
Or not and i think all three of
them i can look at them and

07:57.350 --> 08:04.156
Listen to them and envision they
have a career way after "the

08:04.290 --> 08:08.160
Voice" and go on to v hits and
be stars.

08:08.294 --> 08:12.063
>> let's bring out our remaining
10 artists and get back to the

08:12.198 --> 08:28.780
Business at hand on elimination

08:32.552 --> 08:36.188
Night here on "the voice."
good to have you here.

08:36.322 --> 08:40.392
Another question for mark.
If you are saved tonight, what

08:40.525 --> 08:44.329
Other side of yourself do you
want to show america?

08:44.464 --> 08:47.499
>> it was great to show a
softer, chill side last night

08:47.633 --> 08:51.736
And i think what i'd like to
show america is i'm not a one

08:51.871 --> 09:00.579
Trick pony and there's so much
more to me, so hopefully i'm

09:00.713 --> 09:03.748
Going to show them more sides to
me.

09:03.883 --> 09:08.453
>> good luck to you. Maddy, last
night, pharrell said your

09:08.588 --> 09:11.122
Greatest strength is you know
exactly who you are as an

09:11.257 --> 09:14.793
Artist.
How has pharrell helped instill

09:14.927 --> 09:20.398
That confidence to you?
>> i think i noticed a change in

09:20.533 --> 09:23.969
Myself because that kind of
affirmation for an artist is

09:24.103 --> 09:29.040
Really something that makes you
feel like okay, who i am is okay

09:29.175 --> 09:33.612
And who i am is good and that
kind of confidence is what makes

09:33.746 --> 09:36.248
Me want to go out and be the
best version of myself i can be

09:36.382 --> 09:38.917
Every time.
>> excellent.

09:39.051 --> 09:44.823
Thank you, maddy.
In my hands are the next two

09:44.957 --> 09:58.870
Names who are safe in advancing
to the top 11.

11:30.696 --> 11:34.599
Eliminated.
When we come back, three more

11:34.734 --> 11:35.900
Artists will move on pp

Improved kind of more confident
singer and it's hard for me not

35:30.234 --> 35:34.971
To feel like -- i don't like to

So -- you're so unassuming about
yourself and so bashful and even

The way you're standing there
right now it's like you can't

36:11.709 --> 36:18.582
Imagine that you're the same
person that just gave that

36:18.716 --> 36:24.955
Beautiful of a performance.
Adam's right, i think that was

36:25.089 --> 36:28.258

36:28.392 --> 36:32.896
Voice.

36:39.470 --> 36:43.106
What you have because the rest
is bells and whistles.

36:43.241 --> 36:47.944
What's always here is what's on
the inside and when you're able

36:48.079 --> 36:51.515
To share it so eloquently the
way you sang just now, it comes

36:51.649 --> 36:53.850
