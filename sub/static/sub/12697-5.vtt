WEBVTT

00:02.970 --> 00:06.274
- Hey, why are you here
with no adult supervision?

00:06.340 --> 00:09.377
- Wow. Way to roast yourself.

00:09.443 --> 00:10.844
I need your help.
It's Freddie.

00:10.911 --> 00:12.980
- Is he okay?
I heard him sneeze. Is he sick?

00:13.047 --> 00:14.582
Oh, my God! Is he dying?

00:14.648 --> 00:16.684
Am I your new father?
I accept.

00:18.452 --> 00:20.921
- Don't you just love weddings?

00:20.988 --> 00:22.423
- Oh, no.

00:22.490 --> 00:23.957
He's got wedding fever.

00:24.024 --> 00:27.361
- I just love celebrating love
that lasts a lifetime.

00:27.428 --> 00:29.863
- Or in your case, 14 months.

00:29.930 --> 00:32.366
Last time you went
to a wedding, you met Mom,

00:32.433 --> 00:33.967
so I'm going to be
all over you.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.503
We can't risk another

00:35.569 --> 00:39.240
meet-cute-get-married-go-down-
in-flames-divorce-tragedy.

00:39.707 --> 00:42.876
- Don't worry. As best man,
I only have one job.

00:42.943 --> 00:45.579
- Yup.
To comfort a lonely bridesmaid.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.848
- No. To support the groom.

00:47.915 --> 00:49.983
Weddings are special
and sacred

00:50.050 --> 00:51.652
and should be
treated with respect.

00:52.486 --> 00:54.255
- God, weddings suck.

00:54.322 --> 00:57.225
- So you're wearing
that in protest?

00:57.291 --> 00:59.827
- No. I'm wearing this because
I'm tired of being punished

00:59.893 --> 01:01.295
for looking good.

01:01.362 --> 01:03.197
Do you know how many weddings
I've been uninvited to

01:03.264 --> 01:06.467
because I outshine the bride
at the rehearsal dinner?

01:06.534 --> 01:08.269
- So you're wearing
a white dress?

01:08.336 --> 01:10.538
- Um, this is off, off cream.

01:10.604 --> 01:14.041
Besides prairie-core was all
over the Gucci runway,

01:14.108 --> 01:16.043
so I'm on trend.

01:16.110 --> 01:17.811
- Yet off-putting.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.215
- Forget your obsession
with me.

01:21.282 --> 01:22.983
We need to focus on Carly.

01:23.050 --> 01:24.685
She's been really down
about dating lately,

01:24.752 --> 01:26.754
and now she has to spend
an entire weekend

01:26.820 --> 01:28.822
at the wedding
of her childhood nemesis.

01:28.889 --> 01:30.458
- Nevel Papperman.
- Nevel Papperman.

01:33.294 --> 01:35.663
- You're right. She's going
to be extremely fragile.

01:35.729 --> 01:39.700
- Who's ready for
a really fun wedding?

01:39.767 --> 01:42.069
- See? She's a wreck.

01:42.136 --> 01:43.837
- You despise Nevel.

01:43.904 --> 01:45.773
I thought you'd be upset
about going to his wedding.

01:45.839 --> 01:48.075
- Of course I'm upset.
My sworn enemy wants

01:48.142 --> 01:50.744
to make me miserable
by flaunting his happiness,

01:50.811 --> 01:53.847
but I'm going to make him
miserable by flaunting mine.

01:53.914 --> 01:56.350
- You're still talking
about happiness, right?

01:57.251 --> 01:59.920
- Are you sure you wouldn't be
happier just staying at home?

01:59.987 --> 02:04.725
- Obviously, but if
I stay home...he wins.

02:06.026 --> 02:08.162
- What did Nevel do
to make you like this,

02:08.229 --> 02:09.597
and how can I be more like him?

02:09.663 --> 02:11.499
- When they were kids,

02:11.565 --> 02:13.167
Nevel wrote
a terrible review of "iCarly."

02:13.234 --> 02:15.236
- Then hacked her website
and tried to force Carly

02:15.303 --> 02:17.171
to kiss him.
- Many times.

02:17.238 --> 02:19.773
- Worst of all, he trapped me
in a robot costume

02:19.840 --> 02:21.008
for our half-a-ween party.

02:21.074 --> 02:22.676
- That's not worse
then Carly's thing.

02:22.743 --> 02:26.079
- I heard it as I said it.
- Wait, is that why we all

02:26.146 --> 02:28.616
have to wear robot formal
to the wedding tomorrow?

02:28.682 --> 02:30.884
- No. It's because
he's obsessed with some game

02:30.951 --> 02:34.988
called "Robot Uprising."
God, I hate Nevel Papperman.

02:35.055 --> 02:37.625
[thunder crashes]

02:37.691 --> 02:39.360
- I'm going to
grab some umbrellas.

02:39.427 --> 02:43.831
- I'm going to turn off my
thunder and lightning machine.

02:43.897 --> 02:46.667
- * I know you see *

02:46.734 --> 02:49.136
* Somehow the world
will change for me *

02:49.203 --> 02:52.940
[together]
* And be so wonderful *

02:53.006 --> 02:56.777
- * So wake up the members
of my nation *

02:56.844 --> 02:58.846
[together]
* It's your time to be *

02:58.912 --> 03:01.449
- * There's no chance
unless you take one *

03:01.515 --> 03:04.218
* And the time to see
the brighter side *

03:04.285 --> 03:07.288
* Of every situation *

03:07.355 --> 03:09.357
* Some things
are meant to be *

03:09.423 --> 03:13.093
* So give me your best
and leave the rest to me *

03:17.698 --> 03:19.867
- I love a robot-themed
rehearsal dinner.

03:19.933 --> 03:22.736
Blending sci-fi and romance--
it's like experiencing

03:22.803 --> 03:24.905
"WALL-E" all over again.

03:24.972 --> 03:27.174
- Laugh like I said
something funny--laugh!

03:27.241 --> 03:28.976
[laughter]

03:29.042 --> 03:31.812
- Why are we laughing?
- Because I want Nevel

03:31.879 --> 03:34.548
to hear what a wonderful time
I'm having.

03:34.615 --> 03:37.618
I'm having a wonderful time.

03:37.685 --> 03:41.054
- That's super convincing.
I need a mocktail.

03:41.121 --> 03:42.690
Freddie, you're with me.

03:42.756 --> 03:45.593
I've got to keep an eye on you
and your tender heart.

03:45.659 --> 03:49.297
[bell ringing]

03:49.363 --> 03:53.066
- Robots, robotesses
and nonbinary machines,

03:53.133 --> 03:55.669
please welcome
the most amorous androids,

03:55.736 --> 03:58.171
Prunella Pitz
and Nevel Papperman.

04:03.677 --> 04:06.246
- Carly Shay,
so nice to see you.

04:06.314 --> 04:08.949
I bet you rue the day
you let me get away.

04:09.016 --> 04:13.387
- Oh, Nevel. I rue nothing.
So happy to be here.

04:13.454 --> 04:16.256
- You are so brave to show
your face at a wedding

04:16.324 --> 04:18.959
just weeks
after a humiliating break-up.

04:19.026 --> 04:21.495
- Weeks? It's been three
months.

04:21.562 --> 04:24.565
- Counting the days--
how sad.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.600
But despair not,
I found my soul mate.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.902
Maybe one day
you'll find yours too.

04:28.969 --> 04:32.940
- And where is Prunella?
I've been dying to meet her.

04:33.006 --> 04:35.509
I'm sure anyone who would
marry you is a real treasure.

04:35.576 --> 04:39.480
- Carly Shay? Oh, my gosh.

04:39.547 --> 04:41.982
Prunella Pitz,
thrilled to meet you.

04:42.049 --> 04:44.217
You know, you are so charming
on your channel.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.286
I literally quote you
all the time.

04:46.354 --> 04:48.822
Do I not? Do I not?

04:48.889 --> 04:50.558
Anyway, I am so honored
that you're here,

04:50.624 --> 04:54.662
and might I add, somehow even
more radiant in person.

04:58.766 --> 05:01.869
- Damn it. She's a treasure.

05:01.935 --> 05:04.037
- Ugh. The straights.

05:05.172 --> 05:07.508
Engagement, bridal shower,
bachelor,

05:07.575 --> 05:11.144
bachelorette, rehearsal dinner,
wedding, post-wedding brunch,

05:11.211 --> 05:12.646
if you haven't had
seven parties

05:12.713 --> 05:14.682
celebrating your conformity
to social norms,

05:14.748 --> 05:16.784
did you even get married?

05:16.850 --> 05:18.419
- I'm with you on the showers,

05:18.486 --> 05:21.154
but rehearsal dinners
hold a solemn purpose

05:21.221 --> 05:24.091
to pick out who you want
to hook up with at the wedding.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.726
I regret I have but one Spencer

05:25.793 --> 05:27.861
to share with
so many lonely women.

05:27.928 --> 05:30.931
- Uh-huh. Not having it
because at this wedding,

05:30.998 --> 05:32.766
you'll be sharing
the lonely women with me,

05:32.833 --> 05:35.002
and I'm the undisputed queen
of wedding hook-ups.

05:35.068 --> 05:38.372
- Undisputed? I dispute it.

05:38.439 --> 05:39.807
- Is that a challenge?

05:39.873 --> 05:42.776
- Oh, Harper, if Mark McGwire
wanted a face-off

05:42.843 --> 05:44.578
in a home run derby,
would that be a challenge?

05:44.645 --> 05:45.913
- Depends. Are you saying

05:45.979 --> 05:48.181
you use
performance-enhancing drugs?

05:48.248 --> 05:49.983
- All right. Let's see who gets
the most phone numbers

05:50.050 --> 05:51.419
by the end of the weekend,

05:51.485 --> 05:54.287
then we'll know
who's the true hook-up king.

05:54.354 --> 05:55.856
Gender-neutral monarch.

05:55.923 --> 05:58.025
- Winner plans a date
that the loser has to go on.

05:58.091 --> 06:00.494
- Bet. Wait, this is unfair.

06:00.561 --> 06:03.230
You have twice as many targets
because you go both ways.

06:03.296 --> 06:05.766
- Always, and--ha ha--

06:05.833 --> 06:08.068
I know that you didn't
just try to insinuate

06:08.135 --> 06:10.504
that you're at a disadvantage
because you're straight.

06:10.571 --> 06:12.906
- No. I didn't.
- I thought so.

06:12.973 --> 06:14.542
- That would be crazy.

06:14.608 --> 06:17.177
- I was surprised you asked me
to be in your wedding,

06:17.244 --> 06:19.647
but I guess you never know
the impact you have on people.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.883
- Meet my groomsmen--a distant
cousin who speaks no English,

06:22.950 --> 06:25.018
and this server here,
whom I met 30 minutes ago.

06:25.085 --> 06:27.455
- Robert.
- Doesn't matter.

06:27.521 --> 06:31.391
- Well, I'm the best man.
So that's still special.

06:31.459 --> 06:35.395
- Oh, stupid shoes. Gosh.

06:35.463 --> 06:37.164
- Here, let me help with that.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.835
- Not on my watch.
You're proposing already?

06:41.902 --> 06:43.537
He is so needy.

06:43.604 --> 06:46.073
- I'm helping her buckle
a shoe.

06:46.139 --> 06:48.341
- That's how it all
starts.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.911
Back off, Cinderella.

06:55.182 --> 06:58.051
- Hi, Carly. Hi, Freddie.
Looking amazing.

06:58.118 --> 06:59.987
[giggles]

07:00.053 --> 07:02.856
- Thanks, Prunella.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.758
- Why does she keep tilting her
head and blinking?

07:04.825 --> 07:07.895
- Because she's quirky
and delightful.

07:08.662 --> 07:11.098
- The caterer is calling about
the meal count for tomorrow.

07:11.164 --> 07:12.633
- 12 salmon, 5 chicken,
8 beef,

07:12.700 --> 07:14.067
3 Halal, 2 gluten-free.

07:14.134 --> 07:16.003
[giggles]

07:16.069 --> 07:17.838
- Isn't she wonderful?

07:17.905 --> 07:20.440
My Pruney has a computer
for a brain.

07:20.508 --> 07:23.343
[chuckling]

07:23.410 --> 07:25.212
- You can't tell me
that's not weird.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.715
- For a woman to be good
with numbers?

07:27.781 --> 07:29.850
Carly, get with the times.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.286
- You guys agree with me,
right?

07:33.353 --> 07:35.355
There's something off
about Prunella.

07:35.422 --> 07:36.790
- Come on.

07:36.857 --> 07:38.826
- Although, I was talking
to one of the bridesmaids--

07:38.892 --> 07:40.427
- Did you get her number?
- Duh.

07:40.494 --> 07:42.563
And she was saying she had
never met Prunella

07:42.630 --> 07:45.398
before tonight.
They were only friends online.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.601
- That is strange because I was
talking to this other girl--

07:47.668 --> 07:49.136
- Did you get her number?
- No.

07:49.202 --> 07:51.304
And she said none
of Prunella's family is here

07:51.371 --> 07:53.206
because they all died
in a freak skiing accident.

07:53.273 --> 07:55.108
- That's some
white people nonsense.

07:57.010 --> 08:00.047
- Wait. Has anyone here
met Prunella besides Nevel?

08:01.649 --> 08:02.916
[tapping glass]

08:02.983 --> 08:05.185
- When dear Grandpapa Papperman
told me

08:05.252 --> 08:07.354
I clarification inherit
my trust fund

08:07.420 --> 08:10.457
until I married a human woman,
I was angry.

08:10.524 --> 08:14.427
- Human woman?
- Hetero and humo-normative.

08:14.494 --> 08:17.998
- But now I see Grandpapa
only wanted to me be rich

08:18.065 --> 08:19.933
in money and in love.
[ding]

08:20.000 --> 08:21.702
So if everyone could
raise their glass--

08:21.769 --> 08:23.403
- Oh, no.
Annie's flight got canceled.

08:23.470 --> 08:26.540
I'm down a bridesmaid.
I'm about to short-circuit.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.609
[all gasp]
- Oh, dear.

08:28.676 --> 08:31.244
Where will we find someone
Annie's exact dress size

08:31.311 --> 08:33.046
who's brunette
with high cheekbones

08:33.113 --> 08:35.348
and stands a hair
under 5'6"?

08:39.052 --> 08:43.824
- If only I were tall enough.
- Oh, but you are.

08:43.891 --> 08:45.926
You're a classic 5'5 3/4.

08:47.227 --> 08:49.262
Carly, I know
it's so much to ask,

08:49.329 --> 08:52.399
but would you do me the honor
of standing beside me

08:52.465 --> 08:56.503
for the most
important moment of my life?

08:56.570 --> 08:59.940
- Sure. I'm already having
such a wonderful time,

09:00.007 --> 09:02.643
and being your bridesmaid
will only make it better.

09:02.710 --> 09:06.880
- To my bride, Prunella,
and more importantly, to Carly.

09:06.947 --> 09:08.916
- To Carly.

09:10.017 --> 09:11.852
- Bet you wish you
stayed home now.

09:11.919 --> 09:14.554
- No. Nevel invited me here
to mess with me,

09:14.622 --> 09:16.323
but now I get to mess with him

09:16.389 --> 09:18.959
by exposing this entire wedding
as a sham.

09:19.026 --> 09:20.360
Something fishy is going on

09:20.427 --> 09:22.429
and I think it's
pretty obvious what it is.

09:22.495 --> 09:23.931
- Prunella's a gold digger.
- Prunella's a gold digger.

09:23.997 --> 09:27.434
- No. Prunella is a robot.

09:36.810 --> 09:39.279
- I know I'm going to regret
asking this,

09:39.346 --> 09:40.948
but what are you doing?

09:41.014 --> 09:43.651
- I'm taking all my fridge
magnets to throw at Prunella.

09:43.717 --> 09:46.453
If they stick, it'll prove
she's made of metal.

09:46.519 --> 09:51.024
Ipso facto, domo arigato,
Mistress Roboto.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.426
- And I regret it.

09:53.493 --> 09:55.996
You really think
that Prunella is a robot?

09:56.063 --> 09:59.532
- I know it sounds crazy,
but look at the evidence.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.135
No one at Prunella's
own wedding has ever met her.

10:02.202 --> 10:05.138
Nevel literally said
she has a computer for a brain,

10:05.205 --> 10:08.508
and he needs to marry a human
woman to get his inheritance,

10:08.575 --> 10:11.178
but no human woman
would marry Nevel.

10:11.244 --> 10:15.783
So he threw a robot wedding
and built a robot bride.

10:16.984 --> 10:18.919
- Sounds like a pretty
elaborate scheme.

10:18.986 --> 10:21.321
- Which is exactly what Nevel's
known for.

10:21.388 --> 10:23.023
It's peak Papperman.

10:23.090 --> 10:25.625
And when the bridesmaids get
together for hair and makeup,

10:25.693 --> 10:27.027
I'm going to prove it.

10:27.094 --> 10:29.963
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
I am not going to

10:30.030 --> 10:32.499
let you destroy
this woman's special day.

10:32.565 --> 10:35.168
I'm coming to
that bridal suite.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.170
- Greetings.

10:37.237 --> 10:39.372
The name's Bot.

10:40.941 --> 10:43.010
Spencer Bot.

10:43.076 --> 10:46.814
- I can tell you practiced
that a lot, and it works.

10:48.015 --> 10:50.050
- There's no way
Harper wins this bet.

10:50.117 --> 10:52.052
I already got five numbers
last night,

10:52.119 --> 10:54.654
so I hope she's ready to go
to a men's rights meeting.

10:54.722 --> 10:57.791
- Not so fast, Spencer Bot.

10:57.858 --> 10:59.459
- Holy [electronic beeping]

11:01.128 --> 11:03.864
- Sorry, my robot suit
malfunctioned.

11:03.931 --> 11:06.266
- Wow. Those welding classes
really paid off.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.301
- I know, right?

11:09.069 --> 11:11.504
You've got five numbers.
I've got four.

11:11.571 --> 11:13.673
Give me your phone.
What are their names?

11:13.741 --> 11:15.776
- Right there.
Hot wedding guest one,

11:15.843 --> 11:17.711
hot wedding guest two,
hot wedding guest three--

11:17.778 --> 11:20.113
- That's my number.
You reprogrammed me.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.614
- You're hot.
You're a wedding guest,

11:21.681 --> 11:22.950
and at one point,
you gave me your number.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.318
- Now wait a minute, that's...
all totally true.

11:25.385 --> 11:27.587
Carry on.

11:32.259 --> 11:33.727
- Hey, Prunella.

11:33.794 --> 11:36.496
As your newest bridesmaid,
I just wanted to say...

11:36.563 --> 11:38.531
zero, one, one,
zero, one, one, zero, zero.

11:38.598 --> 11:41.701
- Aw, you agree too.

11:41.769 --> 11:43.570
I've been learning
binary code to surprise

11:43.636 --> 11:46.006
Nevel for our robot vows.

11:46.073 --> 11:48.742
- How are you girls doing?
Need anything?

11:48.809 --> 11:50.143
- Great, Mrs. Papperman.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.912
Oh, could you rustle me up
an ice cream sandwich?

11:51.979 --> 11:53.914
- I meant more Prunella
and her bridesmaids,

11:53.981 --> 11:56.917
but I suppose
I can poke around.

11:59.586 --> 12:01.521
- Prunella,
since it's your special day,

12:01.588 --> 12:03.290
I was just wondering...

12:03.356 --> 12:05.859
could you help me identify
all the traffic lights?

12:05.926 --> 12:08.095
- Maybe after I use
the bathroom, sure.

12:08.161 --> 12:10.697
- Do you need help
in that big dress

12:10.764 --> 12:13.133
with your regular human legs
underneath it?

12:13.200 --> 12:16.136
- Carly, you are so thoughtful.
Boop.

12:19.006 --> 12:20.607
- One more of these,
and I'll make out

12:20.673 --> 12:22.542
with the next guy I see.

12:22.609 --> 12:24.511
Hey, Freddie,
can you get me another?

12:24.577 --> 12:27.815
- Af-firmative.

12:30.217 --> 12:33.286
- So got a little crush
on Freddie?

12:33.353 --> 12:34.822
- He seems great.

12:34.888 --> 12:37.490
- He is, if you look past
the gambling debts

12:37.557 --> 12:39.692
and raging night terrors.

12:41.194 --> 12:45.232
- Monsieur mimosa here.
- I'm actually not thirsty.

12:46.900 --> 12:52.039
- I got a good look, and I'll
say this, she's realistic.

12:56.743 --> 12:58.645
- Seven numbers.
Hope you're ready to spend

12:58.711 --> 13:00.848
a romantic Saturday
at clown college.

13:00.914 --> 13:03.216
- Joke's on you.
I did immersion therapy,

13:03.283 --> 13:06.219
so now clowns only
make me cry sometimes.

13:06.286 --> 13:09.589
Besides, I've got seven
numbers too--we're tied.

13:09.656 --> 13:10.891
- Not for long.

13:10.958 --> 13:13.660
I see a cute girl
and she's definitely queer.

13:13.726 --> 13:15.162
- Oh, I think you're wrong.
She smiled at me.

13:15.228 --> 13:16.930
- You have such a reductive
understanding

13:16.997 --> 13:19.032
of the spectrum of--damn it.

13:19.766 --> 13:21.869
- Check it out--I accidentally
Googled myself.

13:21.935 --> 13:24.471
Wow, super famous sculptor,
and look at that net worth.

13:24.537 --> 13:26.206
- Whereas I--
- Work at Skybucks.

13:26.273 --> 13:27.875
- Which means free lattes,

13:27.941 --> 13:30.143
and if you're in the mood,
a muffin.

13:31.744 --> 13:34.948
- I'm sorry.
Do I know you or you?

13:35.015 --> 13:36.549
- No.
But if you call me sometime--

13:36.616 --> 13:38.251
- No. Call me, girl.
I'm the muffin.

13:44.391 --> 13:45.692
- What is her problem?

13:45.758 --> 13:48.261
- I don't know, probably
gluten intolerant.

13:48.328 --> 13:51.598
- Wow. You look just like
a real bride.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.201
- Oh, I wish I could cry.

13:54.267 --> 13:57.905
- Why can't you?
[whispers] No tear ducts.

13:57.971 --> 14:00.207
- I just don't want
to ruin my makeup.

14:00.273 --> 14:02.109
[giggles]

14:04.244 --> 14:07.147
- Oh, Carly, you saw
the woman pee. Let it go.

14:07.214 --> 14:10.117
- Let this go? Okay.

14:10.183 --> 14:13.220
[clink]

14:13.286 --> 14:14.854
[Freddie gasps]

14:14.922 --> 14:18.258
- Why did you throw this at me?

14:18.325 --> 14:21.561
- Uh...wedding tradition.

14:21.628 --> 14:24.331
Magnets symbolize
lifelong attraction.

14:24.397 --> 14:27.067
- Quick question, though.
Why did it stick to your head?

14:27.134 --> 14:30.203
- Oh, I don't want
to talk about it.

14:30.270 --> 14:33.006
- We're all friends.
Give us the download.

14:34.741 --> 14:38.611
- Okay. I have a steel plate
in my head,

14:38.678 --> 14:41.448
because you know
how my entire family died

14:41.514 --> 14:43.917
in that skiing accident?

14:43.984 --> 14:49.222
I was the only one who made it
out alive, and oh, wow.

14:49.289 --> 14:50.690
Now I am going to cry.

14:50.757 --> 14:52.492
- I'm so sorry, Prunella.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.227
[chime]

14:54.294 --> 14:56.063
- The caterers
lost the Halal meals.

14:56.129 --> 14:57.897
- What?
Kareem is going to freak.

14:57.965 --> 15:00.033
- Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.168
- I'll help.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.070
- I'm not lending you
any money.

15:05.638 --> 15:07.640
- Is it safe to leave you
with Prunella?

15:07.707 --> 15:11.278
- Yeah. I'm done. I promise.

15:12.845 --> 15:15.949
Prunella, I owe you an apology.

15:19.152 --> 15:22.255
What is this?
Is this a battery pack?

15:22.322 --> 15:25.959
- My power supply.
Don't tell anyone.

15:34.801 --> 15:38.371
- She's really a robot.
What am I going to do?

15:38.438 --> 15:40.873
- Almost got the battery
pack in.

15:40.940 --> 15:44.144
- I've got to get out of here.

15:44.211 --> 15:45.478
Nevel!

15:45.545 --> 15:47.714
- Carly.
- Don't Carly me.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.450
I figured out what's going on
here, and it's insane.

15:50.517 --> 15:53.486
- Is it really so insane
to think an epic love story

15:53.553 --> 15:56.956
spanning decades could finally
land on happily ever after?

15:57.024 --> 15:58.425
- Oh, please.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.627
I know your epic love story
with Prunella is a lie.

16:00.693 --> 16:04.497
- You're right, but my love
story with you is the truth.

16:05.865 --> 16:07.334
- Huh?

16:07.400 --> 16:09.969
- Come on, Carly.
No more cat and mouse.

16:10.037 --> 16:11.804
It's time to let me catch you.

16:11.871 --> 16:14.641
- Not now and not ever@

16:16.109 --> 16:18.345
- Yes, run to the altar,
my beloved.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.247
I'll see you there.

16:22.582 --> 16:25.185
- I can't believe the rabbi
shot me down,

16:25.252 --> 16:27.554
but they taught me
some beautiful lessons.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.289
L'chaim.

16:29.356 --> 16:31.158
- How are we going to break
this tie

16:31.224 --> 16:33.060
before the wedding
is over?

16:33.126 --> 16:34.727
Unless...

16:37.897 --> 16:39.566
What's up, mama?

16:39.632 --> 16:41.934
- Can I have
everyone's attention?

16:42.001 --> 16:43.403
I have something to say,

16:43.470 --> 16:45.338
and I know it's going
to shock most of you.

16:45.405 --> 16:48.741
- We're getting married!
Prunella is out, Carly is in.

16:48.808 --> 16:50.543
[all gasp]

16:52.645 --> 16:55.482
- Oh!
["Wedding March" plays]

16:55.548 --> 16:57.984
- Wow. Didn't ask me
to walk her down the aisle.

16:58.051 --> 16:59.352
Okay.

16:59.419 --> 17:02.689
- What?
We're not getting married.

17:02.755 --> 17:05.558
No. No. No.

17:05.625 --> 17:08.128
- Yes, yes, yes.
It's really happening.

17:08.195 --> 17:10.363
Rabbi Lowenstein, go.

17:10.430 --> 17:11.831
- Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here

17:11.898 --> 17:14.967
today to witness--
- No. No gathering, disperse.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.804
- I object.
- Oh, shoot.

17:17.870 --> 17:20.107
Maybe I do like
straight weddings.

17:20.173 --> 17:21.608
- You can't object.

17:21.674 --> 17:23.476
First because
I'm not marrying him,

17:23.543 --> 17:26.246
and second,
because you're a robot.

17:26.313 --> 17:28.315
- What?
- And there it is.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.882
- Admit it, Nevel.

17:29.949 --> 17:32.252
You made the perfect woman
out of steel and technology

17:32.319 --> 17:34.754
and then staged
this entire robot wedding

17:34.821 --> 17:37.424
so that she could blend in.
- Oh, my God.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.359
You think someone
would make a robot of me?

17:39.426 --> 17:43.330
That is so nice,
but why would you think that?

17:45.565 --> 17:47.800
- Because you're way
too good for Nevel,

17:47.867 --> 17:50.270
and you always blink
in that crazy way.

17:50.337 --> 17:52.505
- Oh, it's because I'm not used

17:52.572 --> 17:54.841
to these stupid
lash extensions,

17:54.907 --> 17:58.111
and while they make me look
amazing, I see very poorly.

17:58.178 --> 18:01.181
- But what about your battery
pack? I saw it fall out.

18:01.248 --> 18:03.150
- Battery pack?
What battery pack?

18:03.216 --> 18:04.651
- I have no idea.

18:04.717 --> 18:07.754
Carly's crazy.
She threw a magnet at me.

18:07.820 --> 18:09.856
- Carly,
Prunella isn't a robot.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.359
She's a friend I met playing
"Robot Uprising."

18:12.425 --> 18:14.161
Our relationship
isn't romantic.

18:14.227 --> 18:16.929
- Ooh, twist!

18:18.231 --> 18:19.866
Continue.

18:21.834 --> 18:23.670
- But if you never loved
Prunella, then why did you say

18:23.736 --> 18:27.174
she was your soul mate?
Was it just to make me jealous?

18:27.240 --> 18:30.910
Was this entire robot wedding
just to make me jealous?

18:30.977 --> 18:33.813
- Please, do you really think
I'd stage a fake wedding,

18:33.880 --> 18:36.716
as Freddie to be my best man
to make sure you'd be here,

18:36.783 --> 18:38.651
even though I can't stand him
and never could--

18:38.718 --> 18:39.952
- Hey.

18:40.019 --> 18:42.021
- Invite all your closest
friends and family,

18:42.088 --> 18:44.123
pay actors to fill out
the guest list,

18:44.191 --> 18:46.726
all so you'd go mad
with jealously and realize

18:46.793 --> 18:49.362
you and I were meant
to be together all along?

18:49.429 --> 18:52.265
- Oh, my God.
Nevel, did you do that?

18:52.332 --> 18:54.033
- Would it be so wrong if
I did?

18:54.100 --> 18:56.369
- Wait, you're an actor?

18:56.436 --> 18:58.505
Does that mean you don't
actually like Freddie?

18:58.571 --> 19:00.039
- Oh, God. No.

19:00.106 --> 19:02.242
That was just a choice
I made for my character.

19:02.309 --> 19:04.777
- Well, my work here is done.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.846
I'll be at the bar
getting a Shirley Temple,

19:06.913 --> 19:08.881
extra cherries
for this little princess.

19:13.686 --> 19:16.823
- You paid all the guests?
But your mother was here.

19:16.889 --> 19:18.591
- Oh, Carly, you know
that's not my mother.

19:18.658 --> 19:19.992
You've met my mother.

19:20.059 --> 19:22.562
- Hi, Carly.
Suzie Cunninghart, SAG-AFTRA.

19:22.629 --> 19:25.232
Huge fan.
I'd love to be considered

19:25.298 --> 19:28.201
for any future roles
on your channel.

19:28.268 --> 19:32.405
- No. I'm not casting you,
and I'm not marrying you.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.741
I'm not doing anything
with anyone here.

19:34.807 --> 19:37.076
- Okay.
Okay. The wedding is off.

19:37.143 --> 19:40.213
- Wait, wait, wait. The wedding
is on, at least I hope it is

19:40.280 --> 19:43.550
because there is still one
secret I haven't told you yet.

19:43.616 --> 19:47.887
- She's a robot.
- My secret is that somehow

19:47.954 --> 19:51.858
during this whole crazy scheme,
I fell in love with you.

19:51.924 --> 19:54.361
all: Ooh!

19:54.427 --> 19:57.196
- My thing was more believable.

19:57.264 --> 20:00.933
- Really? You fell in love
with me, Nevel Papperman?

20:04.103 --> 20:05.538
- That was real.

20:05.605 --> 20:07.674
- And as for the battery
Carly saw,

20:07.740 --> 20:10.477
it was supposed
to be a surprise.

20:12.312 --> 20:16.349
- Aw.
- I can't believe it.

20:16.416 --> 20:20.687
Someone loves me. This has
never happened to me before.

20:20.753 --> 20:22.822
Prunella, I love you too.

20:28.595 --> 20:31.130
Carly, are you
going to be okay?

20:31.197 --> 20:32.532
- Yeah. I'll manage.

20:32.599 --> 20:37.537
["Wedding March" plays]

20:37.604 --> 20:39.939
* *

20:44.544 --> 20:47.246
- I was also in a foot cream
commercial.

20:47.314 --> 20:49.382
* Make your scaly feet *

20:49.449 --> 20:51.250
- * Start feeling sweet *

20:51.318 --> 20:52.985
- No way!
Oh, man.

20:53.052 --> 20:57.424
- Oh, are you at our table too?
- I'm actually at--

20:57.490 --> 20:59.892
- Then why don't you go there?

21:05.565 --> 21:07.099
- We were just talking.

21:07.166 --> 21:10.303
Why don't you want me
to fall in love?

21:10.370 --> 21:12.104
- It makes me sad
to see you sad,

21:12.171 --> 21:14.173
so I'm just trying
to protect you.

21:15.942 --> 21:17.910
- Millicent, broken hearts
are part of life,

21:17.977 --> 21:20.980
and you're the kid. Okay?
It's my job to protect you.

21:22.549 --> 21:25.785
- Okay, except when you see
a moth you're going to be all,

21:25.852 --> 21:28.054
"Millicent, get it before
it flies into my mouth

21:28.120 --> 21:30.490
while I'm sleeping."

21:30.557 --> 21:32.892
- Except for then.

21:32.959 --> 21:34.994
So do you think
it's okay if I dance?

21:35.061 --> 21:38.164
- She was a paid actor.
Let it go.

21:38.230 --> 21:39.866
- Not her.

21:42.435 --> 21:45.538
- Just promise me you will not
do your dancing face.

21:45.605 --> 21:47.774
- What face? This face?

21:51.744 --> 21:54.581
I've heard that as a groomsmen,

21:54.647 --> 21:57.717
it's my job to comfort
a lonely bridesmaid.

21:57.784 --> 21:59.586
You want to dance?

22:00.653 --> 22:03.723
- You think I'm lonely?
Why?

22:03.790 --> 22:06.325
Just because I'm in
a wedding dress by myself

22:06.393 --> 22:08.227
at someone else's wedding?

22:08.294 --> 22:11.130
- Why did you get so fixated
on that robot theory anyway?

22:11.197 --> 22:13.400
Because I'm guessing
it's not jealousy stemming

22:13.466 --> 22:16.235
from a deep unfulfilled love
for Nevel Papperman.

22:16.302 --> 22:19.706
- Yeah, no, literally would
rather die.

22:19.772 --> 22:21.173
I don't know.

22:21.240 --> 22:24.310
I guess weddings
just make you feel like

22:24.377 --> 22:28.481
you can't know real happiness
until you find a partner.

22:28.548 --> 22:29.849
The idea that even Nevel found

22:29.916 --> 22:32.985
that when I haven't
kind of struck a nerve,

22:33.052 --> 22:35.221
even though I know
it's not true.

22:35.287 --> 22:36.889
- Okay. Well, first of all,

22:36.956 --> 22:39.325
it is totally possible
to be married and miserable.

22:39.392 --> 22:42.028
- Like you were.
- Twice.

22:42.094 --> 22:45.264
And it's just as possible
to by happy and single.

22:45.331 --> 22:47.634
And you're happy, right?

22:48.601 --> 22:51.904
- You know what? I really am.

22:51.971 --> 22:54.974
I mean, at this exact moment
I'm a little embarrassed,

22:55.041 --> 22:58.010
kind of hungry because
I gave Kimmi my Halal meal,

22:58.077 --> 23:02.014
but overall, yeah, I'm happy.

23:03.516 --> 23:07.053
- Aw, did you guys settle
your silly contest and make up?

23:07.119 --> 23:10.189
- No. People always just want
you more when you're taken.

23:15.828 --> 23:17.664
- Can I confess something?

23:17.730 --> 23:20.767
Our bet is
making me feel gross.

23:20.833 --> 23:23.603
- I agree. I should have
never stooped to your level.

23:23.670 --> 23:24.971
Truce?

23:25.037 --> 23:27.640
- Oh, beautiful ceremony.
- So meaningful.

23:27.707 --> 23:30.710
- Thank you. Call me, bubbelah.

23:33.179 --> 23:35.882
- I win. Enjoy the compost
festival, sucker.

23:35.948 --> 23:37.484
I heard they have
a worm symposium,

23:37.550 --> 23:41.588
a methane workshop and a raffle
for a bucket, okay?

23:41.654 --> 23:44.356
I know you can still hear me.

23:44.423 --> 23:47.193
They also have a 4-hour lecture
on manure and a smell test,

23:47.259 --> 23:49.161
so get them nostrils
ready, baby.

23:53.399 --> 23:54.300
- * Now, life isn't easy *

23:54.366 --> 23:55.902
* When you're a droid *

23:55.968 --> 23:57.837
* But you're about to shuffle
like a humanoid *

23:57.904 --> 24:01.007
* *

24:01.073 --> 24:02.609
* Robot shuffle,
robots *

24:02.675 --> 24:04.276
* Don't call us half-breed *

24:04.343 --> 24:06.412
* Your words can't cut us
'cause bots don't bleed *

24:06.479 --> 24:08.548
* Hands up for the droid's
rights struggle *

24:08.615 --> 24:10.583
* Then take it downtown
with the robot shuffle *

24:10.650 --> 24:12.819
* How low can you go *

24:12.885 --> 24:14.386
* How high is your bot *

24:14.453 --> 24:15.988
* Take-take it downtown *

24:16.055 --> 24:17.323
* With the robot shuffle *

24:18.791 --> 24:19.726
- Ooh!
