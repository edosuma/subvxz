00:26.897 --> 00:27.697
You taste so good.

00:27.731 --> 00:28.532
Oh my God, wait, wait.

00:28.565 --> 00:29.666
It's not recording.

00:29.699 --> 00:30.700
Stop.

00:30.734 --> 00:31.535
Oh, you taste so good.

00:33.302 --> 00:34.638
Okay.

00:34.671 --> 00:36.673
Okay, fuck me.

00:36.706 --> 00:37.974
- When?
- Now!

00:38.008 --> 00:40.011
- When?
- Now!

00:40.043 --> 00:40.845
Now?

00:40.878 --> 00:41.679
Fuck me!

00:41.712 --> 00:43.213
Now!

00:44.982 --> 00:46.551
Oh, fuck.

00:46.584 --> 00:47.384
Oh, God.

00:47.417 --> 00:48.753
Fuck me harder.

00:53.858 --> 00:54.659
Harder!

00:55.726 --> 00:56.528
Oh, fuck!

00:59.698 --> 01:00.532
Fuck!

01:01.365 --> 01:03.234
Oh, fuck.

01:15.247 --> 01:16.081
Oh, God.

02:33.363 --> 02:35.767
Oh, Mondays Ethan has
swimming after school.

02:36.768 --> 02:38.368
What about Wednesday afternoons?

02:39.469 --> 02:40.303
Yeah, sure.

02:46.978 --> 02:48.781
Ethan?

02:51.850 --> 02:52.651
Ethan!

02:55.420 --> 02:56.689
Go outside!

02:56.722 --> 02:58.423
How many times do
I have to tell you?

02:58.456 --> 02:59.490
Hi, Sarah.

02:59.525 --> 03:00.893
Leave the little ones alone.

03:01.794 --> 03:03.194
5:30?

03:03.227 --> 03:05.799
Let me just check the
kid's calendar, one second.

03:05.832 --> 03:08.535
Uh, 5:30.

03:08.568 --> 03:09.769
Oh, perfect!

03:09.803 --> 03:10.637
Great.

03:12.072 --> 03:14.107
Okay, we'll see you then.

03:14.140 --> 03:14.974
Buh-bye.

04:14.772 --> 04:15.706
You okay?

04:16.740 --> 04:17.574
Yeah.

04:18.742 --> 04:20.244
Just gotta get my breath back.

04:31.689 --> 04:34.225
I found Natasha asleep
on the sofa this morning.

04:34.259 --> 04:35.392
She probably needed it.

04:35.425 --> 04:36.728
Yeah.

04:36.761 --> 04:37.962
I thought I'd leave her,

04:37.996 --> 04:39.363
but then she woke
up and she said,

04:39.396 --> 04:40.566
"It's all right, Mom.

04:40.599 --> 04:42.902
"I'm not sleeping, I'm
practicing meditation."

04:45.771 --> 04:47.438
I shouldn't of let
her go to ballet.

04:47.472 --> 04:48.306
No, no.

04:49.175 --> 04:50.676
I think it's good.

04:50.709 --> 04:51.911
Keep a routine.

04:51.944 --> 04:54.013
Your mom's there if
anything happens.

04:54.046 --> 04:55.916
She's gonna be
okay, isn't she?

04:55.949 --> 04:57.050
She's gonna be fine.

04:58.018 --> 04:59.586
We'll find a good therapist.

04:59.619 --> 05:01.755
Oh, I could kill
that little shit.

05:01.788 --> 05:02.622
Hey.

05:04.224 --> 05:06.760
She's a tough little
egg, like her mom.

05:08.762 --> 05:10.230
She's gonna be okay.

05:12.066 --> 05:12.834
Can you get that?

05:12.867 --> 05:13.701
That might be Mom.

05:15.736 --> 05:17.238
No, it's Bek and Joel.

05:17.271 --> 05:18.206
Oh, yeah?

05:18.239 --> 05:19.040
Yeah, they're coming over.

05:19.073 --> 05:20.541
What, now?

05:20.575 --> 05:21.709
Hello?

05:21.742 --> 05:22.910
Oh, shit!

05:22.944 --> 05:23.744
Aw, shit!

05:23.778 --> 05:24.579
Oh!

05:24.612 --> 05:25.412
Just a sec, mate!

05:26.280 --> 05:27.648
Oh, God.

05:27.682 --> 05:28.884
Sorry.

05:28.917 --> 05:29.885
We saw the cars
and just thought...

05:29.918 --> 05:31.119
No, no, no.

05:31.153 --> 05:33.188
We're here, come on down, yeah?

05:34.156 --> 05:36.024
Oh, this is Steve, by the way.

05:36.058 --> 05:37.259
Who?

05:37.292 --> 05:38.827
Just give me a
sec, I'll explain.

05:42.865 --> 05:43.700
Honey!

05:46.569 --> 05:47.402
Towel!

05:47.436 --> 05:48.538
Oh, shit.

05:48.571 --> 05:49.404
Thanks.

05:56.646 --> 05:57.446
Hello?

05:57.479 --> 05:58.348
Hey there!

05:58.380 --> 05:59.182
Hi!

05:59.215 --> 06:00.483
We all clear?

06:00.516 --> 06:01.285
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:01.318 --> 06:02.553
Come on down.

06:02.586 --> 06:03.554
Beautiful
day for it, guys.

06:03.587 --> 06:04.688
Hi.

06:04.722 --> 06:05.656
Sorry about that.

06:05.689 --> 06:06.489
It's all right.

06:06.522 --> 06:07.358
These are for you.

06:07.390 --> 06:08.192
Oh, wow!

06:08.225 --> 06:09.392
They are beautiful.

06:09.425 --> 06:11.528
It's just dahlias
from our garden.

06:11.562 --> 06:12.763
Thank you, Becca.

06:12.796 --> 06:14.765
I really appreciate
it, they're really...

06:14.798 --> 06:16.234
Hey, sorry to parachute
in on you like this.

06:16.268 --> 06:17.269
No.

06:17.302 --> 06:18.069
Oh.

06:19.037 --> 06:20.437
It's fine.

06:20.471 --> 06:22.140
Come on, take a seat.

06:22.173 --> 06:23.108
- Thanks, mate.
- Sure.

06:38.958 --> 06:40.526
Cheers.

06:44.330 --> 06:45.698
Well, you look fabulous.

06:45.731 --> 06:46.565
Oh, stop it!

06:47.701 --> 06:48.902
Oh, no.

06:48.936 --> 06:51.004
We're going to a
fundraiser later.

06:51.038 --> 06:52.505
It's a sculpture gallery.

06:52.539 --> 06:53.674
Yeah, Blue Rinse Brigade.

06:53.707 --> 06:55.142
Kind of assumed it
wasn't your cup of tea.

06:55.175 --> 06:57.311
Oh, I actually find them
endlessly fascinating.

06:58.812 --> 06:59.947
Is your friend joining us?

06:59.980 --> 07:01.014
Steve.

07:01.048 --> 07:01.882
Um...

07:02.783 --> 07:04.686
Joel's received a threat.

07:04.719 --> 07:05.853
What?

07:05.887 --> 07:07.055
Yeah, police
think it's credible,

07:07.088 --> 07:09.257
so now we've got
Agent Smith in tow.

07:09.290 --> 07:10.425
Oh, God.

07:10.457 --> 07:11.759
Joel, I'm so sorry.

07:11.793 --> 07:13.161
That's shocking.

07:13.194 --> 07:14.295
Look, I'm sorry for bringing
this to your doorstep,

07:14.329 --> 07:15.495
it wasn't exactly planned.

07:15.530 --> 07:16.731
Is this to do
with your army days?

07:16.764 --> 07:18.266
No, no.

07:18.299 --> 07:20.903
Lunatic fringe getting lippy
about my stance on refugees.

07:20.936 --> 07:22.071
No way.

07:22.104 --> 07:23.639
Yeah, we're ruffling
feathers, mate.

07:25.641 --> 07:26.976
Well, that'll teach
you to get in bed

07:27.009 --> 07:28.177
with a lefty journo.

07:29.611 --> 07:31.747
Bek did always
warn me about you.

07:32.848 --> 07:33.916
So, do we get protection?

07:33.949 --> 07:35.184
No, no, you're a hack, mate.

07:35.217 --> 07:36.586
And a socialist at that.

07:36.619 --> 07:38.822
As far as the state's
concerned, you're expendable.

07:38.855 --> 07:39.756
What a surprise.

07:41.057 --> 07:42.292
Oh, I wouldn't worry.

07:42.325 --> 07:43.560
If that's the best they
can do for a state MP...

07:43.593 --> 07:44.928
No, no, no, don't
underestimate Steve.

07:44.961 --> 07:46.162
He's an experienced cop.

07:47.530 --> 07:48.965
At the end of the day,

07:48.999 --> 07:50.600
you just gotta get on
with your life, don't you?

07:53.904 --> 07:55.206
Can I get you guys a drink?

07:55.239 --> 07:56.007
Oh, no, no.

07:56.040 --> 07:56.974
We can't stay very long.

07:57.942 --> 07:58.709
Thank you.

07:58.743 --> 07:59.577
Sure.

08:01.946 --> 08:03.114
Hey, is the launch
still happening?

08:03.147 --> 08:04.315
Yeah.

08:04.348 --> 08:05.783
Yeah, we just got the
word that the PM's

08:05.816 --> 08:06.817
arriving first
thing in the morning

08:06.851 --> 08:08.587
to give the keynote.

08:08.620 --> 08:09.421
That is awesome.

08:09.454 --> 08:10.255
Yeah.

08:10.288 --> 08:11.156
It's huge.

08:11.189 --> 08:13.158
Congratulations, Joel.

08:13.191 --> 08:14.493
This is gonna make you.

08:14.525 --> 08:15.827
Well, it's a step in
the right direction.

08:15.861 --> 08:18.463
Yeah, he's worked
so hard for this, so.

08:18.497 --> 08:20.532
Well, federal
parliament, here we come.

08:20.565 --> 08:21.533
We'll see.

08:21.566 --> 08:22.701
We will see, mate.

08:25.038 --> 08:25.838
Hey.

08:25.872 --> 08:26.706
It's fresh made.

08:29.809 --> 08:30.610
Oh, go on, then.

08:30.643 --> 08:31.477
How can I resist?

08:43.791 --> 08:44.625
Thank you.

08:45.626 --> 08:46.427
Bek?

08:46.460 --> 08:47.995
Uh, sure.

08:48.862 --> 08:49.696
Thank you.

08:57.605 --> 08:58.807
Nectar.

09:01.409 --> 09:02.243
Oh.

09:04.879 --> 09:06.147
You okay?

09:06.181 --> 09:07.015
Yeah.

09:08.917 --> 09:11.319
It's turning into a very
long weekend, that's all.

09:11.352 --> 09:12.188
Yeah.

09:19.295 --> 09:21.464
Um, where's Natasha?

09:21.497 --> 09:22.765
Ballet.

09:22.798 --> 09:23.999
With?

09:24.033 --> 09:26.402
Oh, my mom flew
down from Brisbane.

09:26.435 --> 09:27.336
Oh.

09:27.369 --> 09:28.071
Yeah, just helping out while...

09:28.105 --> 09:29.039
That's nice.

09:29.072 --> 09:29.973
Yeah.

09:30.006 --> 09:31.808
So, Natasha's okay then?

09:33.310 --> 09:36.646
Um, I think it's
too early to tell.

09:37.481 --> 09:38.549
Sure, sure, sure.

09:42.652 --> 09:43.988
How are you guys doing?

09:45.089 --> 09:46.724
We're okay.

09:46.757 --> 09:47.925
Yeah?

09:47.959 --> 09:50.928
Yeah, we're okay,
under the circumstances.

09:50.962 --> 09:51.863
Yeah.

09:51.896 --> 09:53.599
We're really feeling
for you at the moment.

09:53.631 --> 09:55.133
Oh, we're really
feeling for you guys, too.

09:55.166 --> 09:57.802
This whole thing,
what a nightmare.

09:59.237 --> 10:03.342
And it's great that you
guys have been so supportive.

10:03.375 --> 10:04.776
Yeah, well, we've always
found in this community

10:04.810 --> 10:08.581
that support's there
if you need it.

10:14.953 --> 10:17.690
We spoke to Ethan
and Ben this morning.

10:18.592 --> 10:20.160
That's good.

10:20.193 --> 10:20.994
Yeah.

10:23.696 --> 10:27.601
We just feel really bad that
we accepted what you told us

10:27.635 --> 10:29.369
without talking
to our boys first.

10:30.537 --> 10:31.472
What do you mean?

10:34.609 --> 10:35.544
Natasha's story.

10:36.611 --> 10:37.411
Yeah?

10:38.547 --> 10:39.947
It just doesn't make sense.

10:42.149 --> 10:43.517
It makes complete sense.

10:46.621 --> 10:49.257
Look, Ethan swears that
he didn't touch Natasha.

10:50.959 --> 10:51.893
Well, he would.

10:52.827 --> 10:53.629
Wouldn't he?

10:53.663 --> 10:54.529
Ethan doesn't lie.

11:00.402 --> 11:02.003
Neither does Natasha.

11:02.037 --> 11:03.205
Listen.

11:03.238 --> 11:04.874
I spoke to a child
psychologist friend...

11:04.907 --> 11:06.075
Hey, mate, I thought
we talked about this.

11:06.108 --> 11:08.211
She's a friend,
and it was anonymous.

11:08.244 --> 11:09.879
She's in the U.S.

11:09.912 --> 11:12.715
But she was very
clear, very adamant

11:12.748 --> 11:16.687
that four year olds don't
make this kind of stuff up.

11:16.719 --> 11:18.120
Oh no, we're not saying...

11:19.657 --> 11:22.259
We're not saying that
Natasha hasn't been subject

11:22.292 --> 11:24.494
to some kind of abuse...

11:24.528 --> 11:25.462
Right.

11:25.495 --> 11:26.564
Just that Ethan didn't do it.

11:27.565 --> 11:28.398
Right.

11:29.667 --> 11:31.201
Well, that's not right.

11:35.473 --> 11:36.274
Listen.

11:37.408 --> 11:39.277
We'd really like to
support you and Natasha

11:39.310 --> 11:41.246
in any way that we can.

11:41.279 --> 11:42.513
And I've got the
number here for this

11:42.548 --> 11:44.482
excellent child
therapist that I know.

11:47.085 --> 11:50.656
Natasha names Ethan and Ben.

11:51.824 --> 11:54.728
She describes the
layout of your house.

11:54.760 --> 11:57.697
She describes the
toy sword which...

11:57.731 --> 11:59.164
The toy sword, exactly.

11:59.198 --> 12:00.466
The toy sword.

12:00.499 --> 12:02.301
The boys don't own a
toy of that description.

12:02.334 --> 12:03.535
It just doesn't add up.

12:03.570 --> 12:05.037
She was struggling
to find the words.

12:05.070 --> 12:07.273
I don't think that it's literal.

12:07.306 --> 12:08.475
Okay.

12:08.508 --> 12:09.843
Last night, Ben told
me this story about how

12:09.876 --> 12:11.278
in the middle of the night

12:11.311 --> 12:13.280
he caught the bus to
his friend's house,

12:13.313 --> 12:14.749
they had this magical feast,

12:14.781 --> 12:16.249
and then he caught the bus home.

12:16.283 --> 12:18.084
I mean, should we believe him?

12:19.119 --> 12:21.421
Well no, because
that's his imagination.

12:21.454 --> 12:23.659
We know that Natasha
is telling the truth,

12:23.692 --> 12:26.628
that's why we're taking
this so seriously.

12:26.662 --> 12:27.862
Okay.

12:27.895 --> 12:29.497
Well, we believe
Ben, who said that

12:29.530 --> 12:32.166
Ethan never touched
him or Natasha.

12:32.199 --> 12:34.435
And Ben is showing
zero signs of distress,

12:34.468 --> 12:37.004
he's just his normal,
bubbly, mystical self.

12:37.038 --> 12:37.872
Bubbly.

12:37.905 --> 12:39.240
Yeah, yes, bubbly.

12:41.443 --> 12:43.912
Look, we appreciate
how difficult it must be

12:43.945 --> 12:45.715
to hear what
Natasha's had to say.

12:45.748 --> 12:46.716
Difficult?

12:47.550 --> 12:48.618
Difficult?

12:49.818 --> 12:51.554
Do you understand how upsetting

12:51.587 --> 12:52.755
these allegations are?

12:52.789 --> 12:54.289
But no one's making
any allegations.

12:54.323 --> 12:57.226
The problem is, mate, you
don't have any evidence.

12:57.260 --> 12:58.227
Well, Natasha's words are all

12:58.261 --> 12:59.329
that child protection needs.

12:59.362 --> 13:00.229
Oh, child protection.

13:00.263 --> 13:01.164
Serious?

13:01.197 --> 13:02.398
We're talking hypothetically.

13:02.432 --> 13:04.100
I am not talking
hypothetically.

13:04.133 --> 13:05.101
Where are the injuries?

13:05.134 --> 13:06.637
Where's the hysterical child?

13:06.670 --> 13:07.870
She's at ballet.

13:07.904 --> 13:10.440
Okay, it was six
weeks ago, Bek.

13:10.473 --> 13:12.309
Well, why has
it taken six weeks

13:12.343 --> 13:13.578
for her to say something?

13:13.611 --> 13:15.512
Well, apparently
that's very common

13:15.546 --> 13:16.815
in kids that age.

13:16.847 --> 13:19.116
They don't have the
language to communicate

13:19.149 --> 13:20.585
an experience like that.

13:20.618 --> 13:23.087
And her behavior
has clearly changed.

13:24.488 --> 13:27.258
You know what I just find
completely heartbreaking, honey?

13:27.292 --> 13:30.161
That both of you would accept

13:30.195 --> 13:31.764
that my beautiful little boy

13:31.797 --> 13:34.065
has done these horrific things.

13:34.099 --> 13:37.936
All we've done is share our
daughter's words with you.

13:37.969 --> 13:41.272
You, you of all people.

13:43.141 --> 13:43.976
Excuse me?

13:48.981 --> 13:50.916
I've spent nine years
making sure that my boys

13:50.950 --> 13:53.419
had the childhood that
was taken away from me.

13:53.452 --> 13:55.722
I have sheltered my
kids, maybe too much.

13:57.256 --> 13:58.924
Ethan doesn't have the knowledge

13:58.958 --> 14:01.027
to even imagine
such things, okay?

14:01.061 --> 14:02.229
He's a little boy.

14:02.262 --> 14:03.664
Okay, that's just naive...

14:03.698 --> 14:04.965
I know my son!

14:04.998 --> 14:06.466
He's probably just
acting out something

14:06.500 --> 14:07.901
he saw on the internet.

14:07.934 --> 14:11.071
Danny, he doesn't have
access to our computers, so.

14:11.104 --> 14:12.607
The last time that I
was over babysitting,

14:12.640 --> 14:14.508
he was playing games
on your desktop.

14:14.541 --> 14:17.445
As I said, we've
just tried to tell you

14:17.478 --> 14:19.213
what Natasha has told us.

14:19.247 --> 14:21.784
I mean, did you want us
to keep it to ourselves?

14:21.817 --> 14:22.718
No, of course not mate.

14:22.751 --> 14:24.218
But it's what Bek just said,

14:24.252 --> 14:24.986
that both of you just seem
ready to judge our boy.

14:25.019 --> 14:25.920
Oh, no, no.

14:25.953 --> 14:27.188
No one's making nay judgments.

14:27.221 --> 14:28.724
We're just trying
to keep you informed

14:28.757 --> 14:30.525
so that we can work
out what's best to do.

14:30.559 --> 14:31.960
We appreciate that,
mate, your honesty.

14:31.994 --> 14:33.962
But please, don't go threatening
us with child protection

14:33.996 --> 14:35.998
over the basis of a
four year old's story.

14:36.031 --> 14:37.533
It's not a story.

14:37.567 --> 14:39.268
No one's making any threats.

14:39.301 --> 14:40.837
Come on, you're our friends.

14:43.840 --> 14:45.274
You haven't got any evidence.

14:45.307 --> 14:46.609
Evidence?

14:46.643 --> 14:47.977
What do you want?

14:48.011 --> 14:49.279
Two male witnesses?

14:49.312 --> 14:50.146
Em.

14:52.750 --> 14:53.584
What was that?

14:56.186 --> 14:57.788
Nothing.

14:57.822 --> 14:58.823
Doesn't matter.

15:08.032 --> 15:08.867
Excuse me.

15:09.868 --> 15:10.702
Mark.

15:11.903 --> 15:12.838
Hey, buddy.

15:12.871 --> 15:14.071
I can't talk right now.

15:14.104 --> 15:14.906
Can I call you back
in a few minutes?

15:16.207 --> 15:18.108
Half an hour max, yeah, okay.

15:18.142 --> 15:18.944
All right, mate.

15:19.009 --> 15:19.812
Thank you, bye.

15:32.257 --> 15:33.492
Look, it's great
that you're taking

15:33.525 --> 15:35.093
what Natasha said seriously.

15:35.127 --> 15:37.764
We fully support you getting
professional help for her.

15:37.798 --> 15:39.566
In fact, we're offering
to help out with that.

15:39.600 --> 15:41.501
Bek knows some great people.

15:41.534 --> 15:42.368
Yeah.

15:44.504 --> 15:47.406
You just need to remove
the names of our kids.

15:47.440 --> 15:48.274
That's all.

15:50.076 --> 15:51.545
I'm not removing the names.

15:54.114 --> 15:55.349
Please, Emily.

15:55.382 --> 15:56.684
Please, please.

15:56.718 --> 15:58.352
We're asking you
as your friends.

15:59.486 --> 16:01.522
You know that
Natasha told us more

16:01.555 --> 16:02.657
about what happened?

16:02.690 --> 16:03.490
What?

16:03.524 --> 16:04.424
I've typed it up.

16:05.860 --> 16:07.060
This is unbelievable.

16:07.095 --> 16:09.364
When Natasha
started screaming,

16:10.599 --> 16:13.167
Ethan put his hands
around her throat.

16:16.404 --> 16:18.206
Do you know how
offensive that is?

16:19.073 --> 16:20.609
Yeah.

16:20.643 --> 16:22.678
Yeah, it is offensive.

16:22.711 --> 16:25.682
And then he put his
hand across her mouth.

16:25.715 --> 16:26.883
What?

16:26.917 --> 16:28.652
He was trying to stop
her from breathing.

16:28.685 --> 16:29.886
I'm sorry.

16:29.920 --> 16:30.820
These are the kind
of fucked up things

16:30.854 --> 16:32.321
a pedophile would do.

16:32.354 --> 16:33.823
Not a sweet little boy.

16:33.857 --> 16:34.824
Okay, I'm not...

16:34.858 --> 16:35.859
He's...

16:37.727 --> 16:39.897
My son is not a monster, Emily.

16:39.931 --> 16:41.632
I know that he
is not a monster,

16:41.666 --> 16:42.800
he's just a little boy.

16:42.833 --> 16:44.602
What do you want from us?

16:44.635 --> 16:45.468
Really?

16:49.506 --> 16:53.209
I just want you guys to
accept that this has happened,

16:55.146 --> 16:58.449
and get some professional
help for your boys,

16:58.482 --> 17:00.786
just like we're gonna
get help for Natasha.

17:02.119 --> 17:03.120
I mean, what possible
harm can come from that?

17:03.154 --> 17:04.355
Ethan didn't do it.

17:04.387 --> 17:06.156
He didn't do it, he
didn't have time.

17:06.190 --> 17:07.290
Oh my God.

17:07.325 --> 17:08.961
I can't bare this, I'm going.

17:08.993 --> 17:09.795
Bek, come here.

17:09.828 --> 17:11.029
Bek, just wait!

17:11.064 --> 17:11.698
We're all adults, we can
figure something out.

17:11.731 --> 17:12.497
All right?

17:12.531 --> 17:14.499
I agree.
Come on, we're friends.

17:14.532 --> 17:15.768
Let's work this out
amicably, please.

17:15.801 --> 17:17.336
I'm gonna get dressed.

17:20.439 --> 17:22.406
Look, maybe I'll put
some snacks together.

17:22.441 --> 17:23.407
That'll be great, mate.

17:23.442 --> 17:24.676
Thank you.

17:24.711 --> 17:25.944
You guys just make
yourselves at home.

17:25.979 --> 17:27.380
There's some beers in the eski.

17:27.413 --> 17:29.515
It's a bit early
for me, but...

18:52.738 --> 18:54.873
That went down like a
fat kid on a see-saw.

18:56.709 --> 18:57.508
Why are they doing this?

18:57.542 --> 18:58.777
Oh, fuck if I know.

18:58.811 --> 19:00.344
They're the ones that
need to be in therapy.

19:01.412 --> 19:02.881
I mean, you were there.

19:02.915 --> 19:03.917
If Ethan had been sticking his
grubby fingers up Natasha...

19:03.950 --> 19:04.851
Joel.

19:04.884 --> 19:06.052
Did you hear her scream?

19:08.121 --> 19:10.289
I mean, did you?

19:10.322 --> 19:11.457
It was six weeks ago.

19:31.112 --> 19:31.946
Em.

19:34.514 --> 19:35.349
You okay?

19:36.651 --> 19:37.953
Did you
invite them in here

19:37.986 --> 19:40.287
to watch me piss as well?

19:40.321 --> 19:44.826
I'm sorry, I just got a
shock, I wasn't thinking.

19:44.860 --> 19:48.362
That fucking bitch!

19:48.395 --> 19:52.235
I want to just smash
her fucking face in.

19:52.267 --> 19:53.102
Hey!

19:54.402 --> 19:55.238
Hey.

19:58.174 --> 19:59.008
Come on.

20:01.276 --> 20:02.078
Come on.

20:05.615 --> 20:06.884
Hey.

20:22.431 --> 20:23.268
Come on.

20:25.536 --> 20:28.305
They're trying to gag us.

20:28.338 --> 20:29.874
They're not trying to gag us.

20:29.908 --> 20:30.875
They're in denial.

20:32.342 --> 20:33.544
That's not an excuse.

20:34.712 --> 20:36.313
It's hard for them to process.

20:39.084 --> 20:40.485
What about Natasha?

20:41.587 --> 20:42.387
And us?

20:42.420 --> 20:43.889
Hey.

20:43.923 --> 20:44.890
Natasha's resilient.

20:46.457 --> 20:47.259
And so are we.

20:48.794 --> 20:51.697
They implied that you
are abusing our daughter.

20:51.730 --> 20:54.935
No they didn't.

20:54.968 --> 20:56.468
They didn't.

20:56.502 --> 21:00.140
They agreed that
Natasha has been abused,

21:00.173 --> 21:01.775
but they won't admit
that Ethan did it,

21:01.808 --> 21:04.244
so who do you think
that they have in mind?

21:04.277 --> 21:05.477
I have no idea.

21:05.511 --> 21:06.780
And I don't think
that they know.

21:06.813 --> 21:07.647
Oh God.

21:10.918 --> 21:12.286
So, what are we gonna do?

21:14.889 --> 21:16.691
Uh, we just have
to persuade them.

21:19.492 --> 21:21.561
I'll talk to Danny,
he's a reasonable man.

21:23.197 --> 21:25.199
You know, I thought Emily
was a compassionate person.

21:25.233 --> 21:27.435
She is, you just need
to reach out to her.

21:29.972 --> 21:31.640
Let's be smart about
this, all right?

21:42.150 --> 21:44.187
Is that really necessary, babe?

21:44.220 --> 21:45.021
Yes, it is.

21:47.323 --> 21:48.191
It just looks...

21:48.224 --> 21:49.025
It looks what?

21:49.058 --> 21:50.827
It looks ridiculous.

21:50.860 --> 21:52.829
Well, you look ridiculous.

21:55.899 --> 21:56.866
Hey, mate.

21:59.136 --> 22:01.238
Yeah, no, it reads
really really well.

22:01.272 --> 22:02.405
I've got a few suggestions.

22:02.438 --> 22:05.175
Just hang on a
sec, just let me...

22:06.877 --> 22:08.379
Bek's all over it.

22:09.713 --> 22:10.981
Just give me a sec, mate.

22:11.015 --> 22:12.049
Here we go.

22:12.082 --> 22:12.917
Thanks.

22:15.787 --> 22:16.855
Yeah, page three.

22:18.590 --> 22:20.158
"We know that
effective intervention,

22:20.191 --> 22:23.929
"change that to early intervention
is crucial, et cetera."

22:23.962 --> 22:27.799
And "after stopping
family violence, comma,

22:29.234 --> 22:31.203
"we're determined to set young
people on the right path."

22:33.406 --> 22:34.974
Beauty.

22:35.007 --> 22:36.375
Cheers.

23:02.904 --> 23:04.672
First thing tomorrow
I am going to go

23:04.706 --> 23:07.442
and call child protection.

23:13.314 --> 23:14.148
Em.

23:15.316 --> 23:16.651
I don't think that we
can do that to them.

23:16.684 --> 23:19.520
Well, it's the
right thing to do.

23:19.554 --> 23:22.157
If we call child protection,
the police will get involved,

23:22.191 --> 23:26.428
social services, I mean,
that's just too much.

23:26.462 --> 23:28.230
I mean, do we want
that for Natasha?

23:28.263 --> 23:30.699
They won't even admit
that Ethan did it!

23:30.733 --> 23:32.401
I know, I know.

23:32.434 --> 23:33.769
Bek of all people!

23:33.802 --> 23:34.838
Look, Bek is...

23:36.272 --> 23:38.208
She's damaged.

23:38.241 --> 23:41.277
I mean, God knows how she's
processing all of this.

23:41.311 --> 23:43.413
It's completely
unforgivable what she's doing.

23:43.446 --> 23:45.648
I'm sure it is not malicious.

23:47.384 --> 23:49.585
If Bek and Joel won't
admit what's happened,

23:49.619 --> 23:51.922
if they can't admit it then

23:51.956 --> 23:54.258
we have a responsibility
to intervene

23:54.291 --> 23:55.726
for the children's sake.

23:55.760 --> 23:57.527
Why are you so trusting
that social services

23:57.560 --> 23:58.696
will get it right?

23:58.729 --> 24:00.197
I mean, you are
usually such a skeptic.

24:00.231 --> 24:01.899
Well, it is the only
way that we're gonna

24:01.932 --> 24:03.566
get anything done now!

24:07.372 --> 24:08.874
Look.

24:08.907 --> 24:10.342
Despite everything that
they've been saying,

24:10.375 --> 24:12.044
they're gonna be watching
Ethan's every move

24:12.077 --> 24:14.146
like a hawk from now on.

24:14.179 --> 24:15.414
Danny.

24:15.447 --> 24:18.316
He needs therapy,
not more policing.

24:21.119 --> 24:23.056
They're a decent family.

24:23.089 --> 24:25.590
We have to trust that
they'll do the right thing.

24:25.625 --> 24:28.027
Okay, like Bek trusted her dad

24:28.061 --> 24:29.595
to sort her step-brother out.

24:29.629 --> 24:31.731
Come on, that's a completely
different situation.

24:31.764 --> 24:32.564
Oh yeah?

24:32.598 --> 24:33.565
What about Ben?

24:33.599 --> 24:34.400
I don't know.

24:34.434 --> 24:35.234
Yeah?

24:35.268 --> 24:36.069
What about Ethan?

24:36.102 --> 24:37.203
I don't know.

24:37.236 --> 24:38.404
What about
Ethan's next victim?

24:38.438 --> 24:39.773
You know, every
child at that school

24:39.807 --> 24:41.175
is at risk now.

24:41.208 --> 24:42.409
I don't know.

24:42.443 --> 24:43.811
Well, those are
the consequences

24:43.844 --> 24:45.012
if they don't do anything!

24:45.045 --> 24:46.180
Well, we don't know that!

24:46.213 --> 24:47.214
Oh yeah?

24:47.247 --> 24:50.117
"My beautiful little boy."

24:50.150 --> 24:51.919
She makes me want to puke.

25:03.531 --> 25:04.999
Maybe taking the
kids' names off

25:05.033 --> 25:07.469
is not such a bad idea.

25:07.502 --> 25:08.837
At least in the short term.

25:10.004 --> 25:12.074
Trust Joel to
come up with that.

25:12.108 --> 25:14.343
Redact the children's
names of a politician.

25:14.376 --> 25:15.644
Hear me out, Em.

25:15.678 --> 25:18.013
It means that we
can refer Natasha

25:18.047 --> 25:19.381
to a therapist immediately.

25:19.415 --> 25:23.285
We can sort out all
this other stuff later.

25:23.319 --> 25:24.253
It's not like we're dealing with

25:24.286 --> 25:25.921
a couple of ice addicts, is it?

25:25.955 --> 25:27.724
They are damaged
though, Danny.

25:27.757 --> 25:30.560
You just said so yourself.

25:30.594 --> 25:33.563
God, I was warned about
Bek two years ago.

25:33.598 --> 25:34.564
I've never warmed to her,

25:34.599 --> 25:36.299
that dark energy that she has.

25:36.333 --> 25:38.268
Should've trusted my instincts.

25:39.402 --> 25:41.371
They've treated us
very well up until now.

25:43.875 --> 25:44.775
Joel's a good man.

25:45.877 --> 25:47.011
He's sound.

25:48.079 --> 25:49.213
Danny.

25:49.247 --> 25:51.782
That friendship or
whatever it is, is over.

25:51.816 --> 25:53.017
Oh, come on.

25:53.050 --> 25:54.886
Do you need more of a reason?

25:54.919 --> 25:57.121
Well, listen, I'll
decide when my friendship

25:57.155 --> 25:58.790
with someone is over, okay?

25:58.824 --> 26:00.125
Oh, okay.

26:00.159 --> 26:02.361
He is a bully, Danny.

26:02.394 --> 26:03.462
Just like his son.

26:04.429 --> 26:05.264
Emily.

26:06.398 --> 26:08.333
You are sounding like
a complete zealot.

26:08.367 --> 26:09.301
Don't say my name like that.

26:09.334 --> 26:10.235
Like what?

26:10.269 --> 26:11.737
Like you're patronizing me,

26:11.770 --> 26:12.905
and I fuckin' hate it!

26:19.312 --> 26:21.047
I'm not calling
child protection.

26:22.115 --> 26:24.217
Well, it's not about you.

26:25.084 --> 26:26.219
I never said it was.

26:27.954 --> 26:29.122
Why are you defending Joel?

26:29.155 --> 26:30.390
I am not def...

26:34.028 --> 26:36.397
I think his heart's
in the right place.

26:37.831 --> 26:39.934
Choose a fucking side, Daniel!

27:30.487 --> 27:31.388
Yeah, mate.

27:31.421 --> 27:32.956
Just give us another
half an hour, okay?

27:32.990 --> 27:33.857
Yeah, we're just
solving a problem

27:33.890 --> 27:35.393
with some friends, that's all.

27:35.426 --> 27:36.527
Okay, call me anytime.

27:37.696 --> 27:38.796
Thanks mate, bye.

27:41.165 --> 27:42.467
What is taking these guys?

27:44.435 --> 27:46.971
How does Ethan know the
password to your desktop?

27:49.841 --> 27:51.310
I didn't know he did.

27:51.343 --> 27:52.544
Emily just said that when
she was over babysitting,

27:52.578 --> 27:53.912
he was playing games
on your computer.

27:53.946 --> 27:54.847
Don't be naive, babe.

27:54.880 --> 27:56.282
He's a nine year old boy.

27:56.315 --> 27:57.149
Little shit probably
knows more about computers

27:57.182 --> 27:58.350
than we do.

27:58.384 --> 27:59.518
All right, so he's
probably found...

27:59.551 --> 28:00.986
Don't
bring that up again.

28:01.020 --> 28:02.888
After all the protections
that I put in place.

28:02.921 --> 28:04.624
Can we just
stay our message, please?

28:04.658 --> 28:06.593
Did you really
just say that to me?

28:06.627 --> 28:08.629
You can't protect
him from the real world, babe.

28:08.663 --> 28:10.096
He's a little boy.

28:10.130 --> 28:11.331
We have a duty of care
to protect him from that.

28:11.364 --> 28:12.599
It's not
a fucking crime.

28:12.633 --> 28:14.868
Exposing him to that
stuff, those images.

28:14.901 --> 28:16.069
You're okay with that?

28:16.102 --> 28:17.705
Keep your fucking
voice down, keep your...

28:17.738 --> 28:19.039
Steve?

28:19.072 --> 28:20.775
Mate, can we just get
some privacy please?

28:22.008 --> 28:23.044
A little bit further?

28:23.077 --> 28:23.911
Thank you.

28:33.622 --> 28:34.455
Look.

28:35.791 --> 28:38.894
Boys throughout the
ages, for all time,

28:38.927 --> 28:40.295
in all countries, look at porn.

28:40.329 --> 28:41.830
It's everywhere.

28:41.863 --> 28:43.666
My old man, he hid his under
the bed, now it's online.

28:43.700 --> 28:45.033
It's natural.

28:45.067 --> 28:46.902
What did our little
boy find, Joel?

28:48.070 --> 28:49.271
Do you know, I
read the other day

28:49.304 --> 28:52.140
that Peppa Pig is three
clicks away from porn.

28:52.174 --> 28:54.712
It doesn't matter what
preventions we put in place,

28:54.745 --> 28:56.512
Ethan's gonna find it on
his own or with his friends,

28:56.546 --> 28:58.716
but it doesn't mean that
every primary school boy

28:58.749 --> 28:59.982
who sees a bit of bonking

29:00.016 --> 29:01.150
is gonna go out and
abuse his neighbor's

29:01.184 --> 29:02.285
four year old daughter.

29:03.286 --> 29:04.187
Ethan knows the difference,

29:04.220 --> 29:05.455
that's what we're teaching him.

29:05.488 --> 29:06.489
And how do you define
a bit of bonking, Joel?

29:06.522 --> 29:09.158
Fuck, don't be prudish.

29:09.192 --> 29:10.093
Prudish?

29:10.126 --> 29:10.928
- Yeah, prudish.
- Prudish?

29:10.961 --> 29:12.363
Yes.

29:12.396 --> 29:14.098
Grown men having anal sex
with barely legal girls!

29:14.131 --> 29:14.932
Keep your voice down.

29:14.965 --> 29:15.767
Oh, what?

29:15.800 --> 29:17.101
I thought you said
it was natural.

29:17.134 --> 29:18.302
Ethan didn't touch Natasha,

29:18.335 --> 29:19.738
so don't make a link
because there isn't one.

29:19.771 --> 29:21.605
But you're happy for
that to be his introduction

29:21.639 --> 29:23.140
to making love?

29:23.173 --> 29:24.676
Well, he's not gonna learn
anything from us now, is he?

29:30.448 --> 29:31.249
Fuck.

29:31.282 --> 29:32.951
You're an asshole.

29:34.854 --> 29:37.623
These guys are into
some weird, kinky shit.

29:37.656 --> 29:39.591
Natasha probably saw them at it,

29:39.625 --> 29:41.559
mixed it up in her little head,

29:41.593 --> 29:42.995
put it onto Ethan
in her nightmares

29:43.028 --> 29:44.530
and coughed it up as
some fanciful disclosure.

29:44.563 --> 29:45.898
Look, I don't give a shit

29:45.931 --> 29:47.868
how you jerk yourself
off in your spare time,

29:47.933 --> 29:49.502
but after everything
that I've done for you,

29:49.535 --> 29:51.036
after all the
sacrifices I've made,

29:51.070 --> 29:53.906
I do not want you taking my
little boy's childhood away.

29:57.510 --> 30:00.547
You have made sure
that Ethan and Ben

30:00.580 --> 30:01.749
have an upbringing
that you never had,

30:01.783 --> 30:02.850
and I salute you for that.

30:02.884 --> 30:04.251
You are doing everything
in your power.

30:04.284 --> 30:06.888
Hell, they know that
underpants rule inside out.

30:09.289 --> 30:11.659
They are living in a
loving, safe household.

30:12.727 --> 30:13.560
They are.

30:15.363 --> 30:16.197
No.

30:19.735 --> 30:21.235
Ethan didn't touch Natasha.

30:21.269 --> 30:22.704
- I know he didn't.
- Oh, God!

30:22.738 --> 30:24.740
I know he didn't, all right?

30:28.443 --> 30:30.379
That's all that matters.

30:34.450 --> 30:35.551
We're doing everything right,

30:35.584 --> 30:37.986
we're doing everything right.

30:56.473 --> 30:57.273
Billy.

31:00.510 --> 31:01.344
Yeah, mate.

31:01.377 --> 31:02.613
It's reading great.

31:02.647 --> 31:03.882
I just think it needs
to be punchier, chief.

31:03.915 --> 31:06.417
We just need to focus on
some of the key things,

31:06.450 --> 31:09.955
you know, just get some
bullet points in there,

31:09.987 --> 31:12.657
strengthening communities,
delivering early support,

31:12.691 --> 31:15.092
securing futures, you
know, that kind of thing.

31:47.861 --> 31:48.662
I'm sorry.

31:54.969 --> 31:57.337
Look, whatever your
feelings are on Joel,

31:57.371 --> 31:58.840
he's doing a lot of good work.

31:59.807 --> 32:01.141
I know.

32:01.174 --> 32:02.543
He's got the children
and families portfolio,

32:02.576 --> 32:03.845
for fuck's sake.

32:04.946 --> 32:06.113
I'm sorry, Danny.

32:06.146 --> 32:07.983
But I don't think that's
a good enough reason

32:08.017 --> 32:09.617
for us to not do anything.

32:09.652 --> 32:11.085
Look, Joel's out
on a limb here.

32:11.119 --> 32:14.055
I mean, forget about some
nutter making a death threat.

32:14.088 --> 32:15.256
He's got mainstream enemies

32:15.290 --> 32:16.992
queuing up to take him down.

32:17.026 --> 32:20.395
I mean, all it would
take is one cop,

32:20.428 --> 32:24.300
one social worker, one
bloody admin person

32:24.333 --> 32:26.836
at child protection to
leak Natasha's statement

32:26.870 --> 32:28.638
and it would ruin
him, guaranteed.

32:28.672 --> 32:31.140
It would discredit
everything that he's done.

32:33.542 --> 32:35.544
If Joel can't
take responsibility

32:35.578 --> 32:37.279
for the actions of his son,

32:38.683 --> 32:40.718
I don't think he has a
right to be in government.

32:40.751 --> 32:42.485
Come on, Emily.

32:42.519 --> 32:45.188
You know it's not
that black and white.

32:45.221 --> 32:47.257
What about his work
with the refugees?

32:49.994 --> 32:52.195
Are you defending
Joel now or your book?

32:53.664 --> 32:55.801
I am not gonna
prioritize a book

32:55.834 --> 32:57.268
over the needs of my daughter.

32:57.301 --> 32:59.203
Or the needs of
Bek and Joel's kids?

32:59.236 --> 33:01.138
Please, do not
conflate the two.

33:01.172 --> 33:02.908
No, I think you're
conflating the two.

33:02.941 --> 33:04.375
It's not about
the fucking book!

33:14.353 --> 33:15.187
Okay.

33:22.227 --> 33:23.062
Then what?

33:24.363 --> 33:25.263
I'm sorry.

33:27.968 --> 33:30.738
I'm just worried about all
of this getting out of hand.

33:32.338 --> 33:35.141
I mean, Joel and Bek,
they're their parents.

33:35.174 --> 33:37.711
Can we please keep some
perspective on this?

33:40.146 --> 33:40.981
Danny.

33:43.985 --> 33:47.421
If this were some
friend of yours

33:47.454 --> 33:51.126
that had raped his
wife and then raped me,

33:52.093 --> 33:53.628
would you be talking like this?

33:53.662 --> 33:54.495
My God.

33:55.462 --> 33:57.699
That is a ridiculous comparison.

33:57.732 --> 33:58.533
Is it?

33:58.566 --> 34:00.036
Yes, it is!

34:00.069 --> 34:01.503
Because we're talking
about children, not adults.

34:01.536 --> 34:03.773
Because children
aren't adults.

34:03.806 --> 34:06.241
Yeah, but they
are human beings.

34:08.309 --> 34:13.313
And just because they can't
express things like adults can

34:14.516 --> 34:17.485
doesn't mean that they
haven't been traumatized

34:17.520 --> 34:18.855
in the same way.

34:20.589 --> 34:21.424
I know.

34:22.625 --> 34:23.458
I know.

34:26.462 --> 34:29.331
It's just if we pick a
fight with these guys,

34:29.364 --> 34:32.103
you've gotta think through
the consequences for Natasha

34:32.136 --> 34:33.203
and for us.

34:34.471 --> 34:36.808
I'm not picking a fight.

34:36.841 --> 34:39.409
Em, these guys are powerful.

34:39.443 --> 34:41.445
They know everyone
in this community.

34:41.478 --> 34:43.147
You know, the same community

34:43.181 --> 34:45.282
that we moved here
to be a part of.

34:47.186 --> 34:48.020
What?

34:48.920 --> 34:50.554
Oh, Christ.

34:50.588 --> 34:51.422
Sir.

34:52.356 --> 34:54.458
This is a private conversation.

35:05.905 --> 35:06.740
Fuck.

35:15.115 --> 35:17.516
If you're worried about
being the bad guy,

35:17.549 --> 35:18.886
I'll take it out of your hands.

35:18.919 --> 35:21.287
That is not what I'm saying.

35:21.321 --> 35:22.189
Okay, then what?

35:22.223 --> 35:23.456
I don't know, Em!

35:24.959 --> 35:26.894
This just feels a
little like revenge.

35:35.203 --> 35:36.204
Fuck.

35:36.238 --> 35:37.072
Okay.

35:38.974 --> 35:40.008
I'm sorry.

35:40.041 --> 35:40.876
I'm sorry.

35:42.376 --> 35:43.211
I'm sorry.

35:46.948 --> 35:51.154
I'm just trying to make
sense of this too, I'm sorry.

35:51.187 --> 35:53.189
I'm just doing
this for the kids.

35:53.222 --> 35:54.824
I know.

35:54.857 --> 35:55.892
I know.

35:55.925 --> 35:56.759
I know.

35:58.393 --> 36:03.398
But, please, can we just
try to just talk it out

36:05.600 --> 36:06.804
with Bek and Joel?

36:06.837 --> 36:08.939
Just see if we can bring
them around amicably.

36:08.972 --> 36:09.840
Please, can we?

36:13.043 --> 36:14.244
Okay.

36:14.278 --> 36:15.478
Okay.

36:15.511 --> 36:16.345
Okay.

36:19.615 --> 36:21.350
But if that doesn't work,

36:22.687 --> 36:25.089
I am taking Natasha
to a psychologist,

36:26.224 --> 36:27.959
and I'm giving them
the transcripts,

36:29.593 --> 36:31.229
and I'm not taking
the names off.

36:33.298 --> 36:36.134
And you need to
support me on that.

36:38.237 --> 36:39.071
Em.

36:40.272 --> 36:41.674
Of course I support you.

36:43.776 --> 36:44.609
Of course.

36:45.510 --> 36:46.344
Of course.

36:49.347 --> 36:50.415
Look, if it comes to that,

36:50.448 --> 36:51.951
I think we'll regret it.

36:51.984 --> 36:52.818
But...

37:11.105 --> 37:12.405
Oof.

37:13.274 --> 37:14.108
Come on.

37:15.009 --> 37:15.843
Come on.

37:24.185 --> 37:25.786
What are you doing?

37:27.322 --> 37:29.057
Printing out the transcripts.

37:34.196 --> 37:35.596
Right.

39:00.687 --> 39:02.790
Transcripts of
Natasha's disclosures.

39:04.058 --> 39:04.926
It's all verbatim.

39:10.231 --> 39:11.065
Joel?

39:15.602 --> 39:17.438
He should have that
phone grafted to his ear.

39:17.472 --> 39:18.807
Should I take it down to him?

39:18.841 --> 39:20.042
Yeah.

39:20.075 --> 39:21.343
I mean, it'll get
cold otherwise.

39:27.116 --> 39:28.117
See you in a sec.

39:28.150 --> 39:29.752
See you in a sec.

39:32.755 --> 39:34.224
I'm sorry I got angry.

39:39.095 --> 39:41.798
It's really difficult
for Joel and I, honey.

39:41.831 --> 39:43.266
I can understand that.

39:48.471 --> 39:50.540
Bek, I really don't want this

39:50.573 --> 39:53.778
to impact on Natasha
and Ben's friendship.

39:56.414 --> 39:59.083
I don't want this to impact
on Ben or Ethan period.

40:03.921 --> 40:06.557
Well, have we decided on the
wording of the communicate?

40:07.492 --> 40:08.360
We have?

40:08.393 --> 40:10.195
Well, it all sounds...

40:10.228 --> 40:11.496
Oh, fuck.

40:13.532 --> 40:14.733
Hang on a sec, mate.

40:14.766 --> 40:15.967
Can I just call
you back in a bit?

40:16.001 --> 40:18.403
Yeah, I've just gotta
sort something out.

40:18.437 --> 40:19.570
All right, thanks mate.

40:19.603 --> 40:21.206
Cheers.

40:21.239 --> 40:22.075
I'm sorry, mate.

40:23.276 --> 40:25.311
I think you
just killed a fairy.

40:25.344 --> 40:27.080
I might've.

40:27.113 --> 40:27.947
Cheers.

40:32.085 --> 40:32.885
I'm sorry.

40:32.919 --> 40:33.886
Em's pretty upset.

40:33.920 --> 40:34.787
Ah, it's all right.

40:34.821 --> 40:35.955
It's shitty for us all.

40:39.393 --> 40:40.260
Maybe we should head up?

40:40.294 --> 40:41.228
No, no, no, no.

40:41.261 --> 40:42.396
Bek's got a healing candle out,

40:42.429 --> 40:43.629
we should give them some space.

40:43.664 --> 40:45.732
There is some of that
circular talking.

40:45.766 --> 40:47.701
I'm a little bit scared to
leave them alone up there.

40:47.734 --> 40:48.702
Yeah, it'll be all right.

40:51.038 --> 40:52.605
Oh, thanks for bringing
the chainsaw by the way.

40:52.638 --> 40:53.540
Oh, it's all right,
it's all right.

40:53.574 --> 40:54.342
Anytime.

40:56.311 --> 40:57.579
Why don't you show
me the damage?

40:57.611 --> 40:59.613
Well, I fixed the
pool fence already.

41:01.549 --> 41:02.450
Oh, wow.

41:02.484 --> 41:03.251
I didn't even notice.

41:03.284 --> 41:04.419
That was pretty crooked.

41:04.452 --> 41:05.954
Yeah, insurance paid.

41:05.987 --> 41:07.755
Broken pool fence is
a priority, it seems.

41:07.789 --> 41:08.990
Right.

41:09.023 --> 41:10.793
And that is the
remains of the tree.

41:13.329 --> 41:14.230
Fuck me.

41:16.198 --> 41:18.067
Lucky that didn't come
down on your house.

41:18.100 --> 41:19.201
Tell me about it.

41:20.803 --> 41:22.738
Wait 'til you see the creek.

41:22.771 --> 41:24.507
It's like something
out of a psalm.

42:41.655 --> 42:44.491
Listen, I forgot to say
with all this going on,

42:45.827 --> 42:48.863
congratulations on
your nomination.

42:48.897 --> 42:49.864
Thank you.

42:49.898 --> 42:51.333
Ah, it's very exciting.

42:52.267 --> 42:54.169
When's the ceremony?

42:54.202 --> 42:55.470
Middle of the year.

42:56.706 --> 42:57.939
I'll have to get you
all dressed up then.

43:01.744 --> 43:03.680
You're so brave, making that.

43:05.081 --> 43:07.183
Mm, no.

43:07.216 --> 43:08.784
What do you mean?

43:08.818 --> 43:11.220
You risked your life
to make that film.

43:13.756 --> 43:15.925
Just glad that the
story's out there now.

43:17.560 --> 43:18.696
You risked your life.

43:19.997 --> 43:21.632
They were
calculated risks.

43:21.666 --> 43:22.966
Oh, it was a war zone.

43:24.067 --> 43:25.602
I didn't know it
was all gonna kick off

43:25.636 --> 43:26.870
when we started filming.

43:26.903 --> 43:27.705
Oh, of course.

43:27.739 --> 43:28.572
Silly me.

43:30.374 --> 43:31.141
How long were you gone?

43:31.174 --> 43:32.476
Was it three months?

43:34.012 --> 43:35.146
Oh.

43:35.179 --> 43:36.749
Tashy must of
missed you so much.

43:37.949 --> 43:39.685
Yeah, it felt like
a really long time.

43:39.718 --> 43:40.551
Mm.

43:41.619 --> 43:43.655
You're going again, right?

43:45.089 --> 43:45.923
Yeah.

43:49.995 --> 43:51.797
I owe it to Nas.

43:51.830 --> 43:53.832
She risked a lot
more than I did.

43:55.401 --> 43:56.201
Wow.

43:59.038 --> 44:01.006
I'm sorry, I just
can't understand that.

44:01.040 --> 44:02.574
Mm, mm.

44:02.608 --> 44:04.109
Come on, Bek.

44:04.143 --> 44:07.047
You're not gonna give me that
bad mother bullshit, are you?

44:07.080 --> 44:09.582
Natasha's four
years old, honey.

44:13.953 --> 44:15.288
I didn't know that you were so

44:15.322 --> 44:17.090
conservative about this.

44:18.191 --> 44:19.626
I don't think
there's anything wrong

44:19.659 --> 44:22.063
with being conservative
when it comes to your kids.

44:22.096 --> 44:22.930
I just...

44:24.665 --> 44:26.567
I can't understand
how you can be

44:26.600 --> 44:29.003
so ambivalent about this.

44:30.471 --> 44:32.306
And if I was a man?

44:32.340 --> 44:34.041
Men aren't mothers.

44:34.075 --> 44:36.310
They have very different
responsibilities.

44:36.344 --> 44:38.213
They're much freer
than us to indulge

44:38.246 --> 44:40.949
in their stupid desires.

44:43.786 --> 44:44.721
I don't think that
this is a great time

44:44.754 --> 44:46.188
for us to talk about this.

44:47.389 --> 44:49.224
Well, actually, I
was hoping that this

44:49.257 --> 44:53.563
could be a safe space
for us to be open

44:53.596 --> 44:57.633
and honest with each other
about difficult things.

44:57.667 --> 44:58.501
Okay.

45:00.671 --> 45:03.741
Well, then, honestly...

45:05.208 --> 45:09.748
Why can't you believe that
Ethan may have done this?

45:15.386 --> 45:16.821
Well, first of all,

45:18.790 --> 45:22.025
Ethan didn't have
time to groom Natasha.

45:22.059 --> 45:24.661
There's no suggestion
that he groomed her.

45:24.696 --> 45:27.432
He doesn't take any
notice of her at all.

45:27.465 --> 45:28.701
Well, he's a child.

45:30.836 --> 45:31.737
Okay.

45:31.771 --> 45:33.238
Let me explain something to you.

45:34.606 --> 45:38.243
With my step-brother, we'd
known each other for 10 years.

45:40.211 --> 45:41.547
I had a crush on him.

45:42.915 --> 45:45.284
I trusted him completely.

45:45.317 --> 45:49.790
And that is why I let him.

45:51.390 --> 45:53.159
That's why he could...

45:55.261 --> 45:56.362
Even when it ha...

46:00.100 --> 46:01.268
Even when it went bad,

46:02.536 --> 46:03.805
I still wanted him to love me.

46:03.838 --> 46:06.440
That's how these
things happen, okay?

46:07.675 --> 46:10.177
Maybe because he was
a teenager, I mean...

46:10.210 --> 46:11.311
I was a child.

46:12.946 --> 46:13.749
I know.

46:15.249 --> 46:17.118
And that's why I'm
asking you, Bek,

46:17.151 --> 46:18.219
as a survivor.

46:20.955 --> 46:23.324
Believe Natasha, I
mean, listen to her.

46:24.827 --> 46:25.660
Please.

46:27.763 --> 46:30.733
Like I said, Ethan's too young

46:30.767 --> 46:33.569
to even know any of this stuff.

46:33.602 --> 46:35.671
It's just impossible.

46:37.206 --> 46:38.307
It doesn't make sense.

46:41.176 --> 46:43.111
But maybe he's
acting out something

46:43.145 --> 46:44.546
that he saw.

46:44.580 --> 46:45.749
No!

46:45.783 --> 46:46.983
Because the only
place that he's been

46:47.016 --> 46:48.151
out of our sight for
any length of time

46:48.184 --> 46:50.453
is at school, or
with my sister-in-law

46:50.487 --> 46:52.622
or my aunt, both of
whom I trust implicitly.

46:52.655 --> 46:55.124
So, it doesn't
add up, I'm sorry.

46:55.158 --> 46:56.559
Something on the computer.

46:58.696 --> 47:00.263
He plays video games.

47:00.296 --> 47:03.234
He likes guns, and
explosions, and Minecraft.

47:03.267 --> 47:06.070
He's a little boy, he's not
interested in anything else.

47:07.238 --> 47:09.139
Is Joel still
downloading porn?

47:12.878 --> 47:14.679
That was a one off.

47:14.713 --> 47:16.915
Bek, you told me
that he was an addict.

47:18.985 --> 47:19.819
Okay.

47:20.753 --> 47:23.255
That was the Chardonnay talking.

47:23.288 --> 47:25.223
It was a one off,
and you promised me

47:25.257 --> 47:27.192
that you would never
mention that again.

47:27.225 --> 47:28.794
Bek.

47:28.828 --> 47:29.829
Okay.

47:29.862 --> 47:31.296
Can I be honest for a moment?

47:31.329 --> 47:32.230
Please.

47:32.264 --> 47:33.466
I think you're a hypocrite.

47:37.738 --> 47:40.540
We have parental
controls on our computers.

47:40.573 --> 47:42.174
We know that it's
not just kids' brains

47:42.208 --> 47:44.644
that get re-wired
watching that shit.

47:46.112 --> 47:47.647
We're not addicts.

47:47.681 --> 47:50.818
But you do act
out what you watch, yeah?

47:50.852 --> 47:51.753
There's nothing
wrong with that,

47:51.786 --> 47:52.987
we're consenting adults.

47:53.021 --> 47:53.988
Don't you think
it's more likely

47:54.022 --> 47:55.289
that Natasha's seen something?

47:55.322 --> 47:57.424
No, that doesn't follow.

47:57.457 --> 47:59.259
The psychiatrist that
Jenny spoke to says that...

47:59.293 --> 48:01.395
She still sleeps
in your room, honey.

48:03.397 --> 48:04.866
We do have other rooms, Bek.

48:06.001 --> 48:07.970
Well, I hope they've
got locks on them.

48:19.514 --> 48:22.819
Fuck me.

48:22.852 --> 48:24.054
You're gonna need more
than a chainsaw, mate.

48:24.086 --> 48:24.888
That's rooted.

48:24.921 --> 48:25.789
No shit.

48:27.456 --> 48:29.091
You don't have any
access down here.

48:31.126 --> 48:33.697
I'm afraid you're stuck
with that until it drops.

48:33.730 --> 48:34.530
Nothing I can do then?

48:34.563 --> 48:35.497
Widow makers.

48:35.531 --> 48:37.033
Sorry?

48:37.067 --> 48:37.969
It's what the
early timber cutters

48:38.002 --> 48:39.669
called the gumtrees up here.

48:39.704 --> 48:40.537
Oh.

48:41.806 --> 48:43.173
Oh, well.

48:43.206 --> 48:45.141
Maybe I was never meant
to have a boardwalk.

48:45.175 --> 48:47.477
What, you think some
vengeful spirit did this?

48:48.678 --> 48:49.714
Fuckin' hippy.

49:01.325 --> 49:04.161
You know what the headline
is for our briefing tomorrow?

49:04.195 --> 49:04.997
No.

49:05.998 --> 49:07.733
Hasn't been leaked?

49:07.766 --> 49:08.599
Not to me.

49:10.302 --> 49:12.739
Strong Families,
Safe Children.

49:15.641 --> 49:17.110
Right.

49:17.142 --> 49:18.878
So you see, I need
these allegations

49:18.911 --> 49:21.146
like a fucking hole in the head.

49:21.179 --> 49:22.347
Well, I can't help the timing.

49:22.381 --> 49:23.148
All I'm asking is
that we keep this

49:23.181 --> 49:24.282
private between us.

49:24.316 --> 49:25.585
I'm asking you this as a friend.

49:25.618 --> 49:26.386
How?

49:26.419 --> 49:27.688
Simple.

49:27.721 --> 49:28.922
Minimize the disclosure.

49:30.791 --> 49:32.793
If you weren't a politician
and I wasn't a journalist,

49:32.826 --> 49:34.928
would we be even having
this conversation?

49:38.032 --> 49:40.199
You're killing
me, you know that?

49:40.233 --> 49:41.770
Look, I'm sure
we can work it out,

49:41.803 --> 49:43.404
but I have to put
my daughter first.

49:43.437 --> 49:44.638
What, by parading
my son in public?

49:44.672 --> 49:46.440
No, if we're discreet...

49:46.473 --> 49:47.374
Fuck off, mate.

49:47.408 --> 49:48.542
Don't treat me like a muppet.

49:49.744 --> 49:50.879
You know damn well
that if this story

49:50.912 --> 49:52.147
gets out to a therapist

49:52.179 --> 49:53.414
and that triggers
a mandatory report,

49:53.447 --> 49:54.749
it's just a matter of
time before it leaks.

49:54.783 --> 49:55.582
It's not inevitable.

49:55.616 --> 49:56.951
Does Emily hate Bek?

49:56.985 --> 49:57.787
What?

49:57.820 --> 49:58.754
No.

49:58.788 --> 50:00.221
No, of course not.

50:00.255 --> 50:01.157
I mean, it felt like a
fucking blame game up there.

50:01.189 --> 50:02.557
Look, I told you, Em's upset.

50:02.590 --> 50:03.826
Don't take it personally.

50:03.859 --> 50:05.695
Telling me what to
do with my own son.

50:08.630 --> 50:09.531
That's my Emily.

50:15.972 --> 50:17.606
Bek, I know you
believe in therapy,

50:17.640 --> 50:19.976
I mean you said it
saved your life.

50:21.444 --> 50:24.413
So, I don't understand why
you're being so resistant

50:24.447 --> 50:27.216
about the idea of
the kids just going

50:27.249 --> 50:28.517
to speak to someone.

50:31.122 --> 50:32.890
Because I don't
want Ethan to feel

50:32.924 --> 50:35.258
like he's done something
wrong when he hasn't.

50:37.729 --> 50:39.262
You're making out that
my son's a criminal.

50:39.296 --> 50:40.865
No, he's not a criminal,

50:40.898 --> 50:42.133
he's just a little boy.

50:42.166 --> 50:44.035
I actually prefer
it if we didn't use

50:44.068 --> 50:45.470
this kind of emotive language.

50:45.503 --> 50:48.272
You're making assumptions
that he's guilty.

50:48.306 --> 50:51.542
I am not criminalizing anyone.

50:53.746 --> 50:55.147
This is just about making sure

50:55.180 --> 50:57.648
that the kids are safe and well.

51:03.056 --> 51:03.823
Emily.

51:05.324 --> 51:08.560
Natasha's story is make believe.

51:14.033 --> 51:15.735
Was your story make believe?

51:22.375 --> 51:23.309
Absolutely not.

51:25.246 --> 51:27.280
12 year olds aren't
capable of lying?

51:27.313 --> 51:30.316
That's a completely
different situation.

51:30.350 --> 51:31.518
No.

51:31.551 --> 51:33.855
It's exactly the same situation.

51:33.889 --> 51:35.857
You should've been believed.

51:35.891 --> 51:38.160
Natasha should be believed.

51:38.193 --> 51:39.393
That's how it should be.

51:40.294 --> 51:41.797
We are the victims here.

51:41.830 --> 51:42.998
Don't you see that?

51:44.232 --> 51:46.134
Ethan is my son.

51:46.168 --> 51:49.304
He's my flesh and blood,

51:49.337 --> 51:51.741
and that is why I know in here,

51:51.774 --> 51:56.444
I know he did not do this.

51:59.282 --> 52:00.348
Do you understand me?

52:22.907 --> 52:24.075
Did I tell you that
my great grandparents

52:24.108 --> 52:26.311
were some of the
first settlers here?

52:26.343 --> 52:27.178
No.

52:29.080 --> 52:32.683
Pitched their tent just to
the east of the post office.

52:34.152 --> 52:35.119
Four kids.

52:35.153 --> 52:35.987
Right.

52:38.623 --> 52:39.624
1890's depression.

52:42.728 --> 52:43.829
People in the city
were starving,

52:43.863 --> 52:45.064
so the state
government started off

52:45.097 --> 52:46.899
loaning crammed
land to save lives.

52:46.932 --> 52:48.300
Really?

52:48.334 --> 52:49.134
I didn't know that.

52:49.168 --> 52:50.002
Yeah.

52:51.636 --> 52:52.771
You wouldn't know to look at it,

52:52.805 --> 52:55.208
but this land is
littered with the graves

52:55.242 --> 52:56.810
of families that didn't make it.

53:00.881 --> 53:05.651
My great grandmother, she
had this little Bible.

53:07.553 --> 53:11.558
And she wrote on
the inside cover how

53:13.426 --> 53:15.629
despite all the horrors,
they stayed strong.

53:17.265 --> 53:19.367
Our family started looking
out for one another.

53:21.969 --> 53:23.637
When one of her neighbors died,

53:23.670 --> 53:25.140
my great grandfather
brought the block next door

53:25.173 --> 53:28.010
so his widow and
kids could survive.

53:29.311 --> 53:30.145
Right.

53:35.717 --> 53:38.020
The point is, Danny, this
is the community I represent.

53:40.421 --> 53:43.159
It's a community whose
codes of civil conduct

53:43.192 --> 53:45.261
were forged by the
need to survive.

53:47.864 --> 53:49.631
By the need to trust
your neighbors.

53:51.433 --> 53:54.270
In this community, you fly
out those codes at your peril.

53:59.410 --> 54:02.279
Save the speeches
for Parliament, mate.

54:02.313 --> 54:04.514
I know my rights in
21st century Australia,

54:04.547 --> 54:06.383
and I don't need a
history lesson about

54:06.417 --> 54:09.820
the morals of the
early European settlers

54:09.853 --> 54:11.554
whose values also included

54:11.587 --> 54:14.092
dispossession,
rape, and genocide.

54:14.125 --> 54:16.527
Okay, well, if there
is a vengeful spirit

54:16.560 --> 54:19.064
staring in your creek,
don't say I didn't warn ya.

54:25.804 --> 54:26.905
Are you threatening me?

54:26.938 --> 54:27.772
Look.

54:29.275 --> 54:30.542
If I can't trust
you on this, mate,

54:30.575 --> 54:31.444
then all deals are off.

54:31.476 --> 54:32.712
You understand?

54:32.745 --> 54:33.645
And that includes
our fuckin' book.

54:33.678 --> 54:34.914
No, see.

54:34.947 --> 54:36.481
You're not talking
about trust, Joel,

54:36.514 --> 54:38.050
you're talking about loyalty.

54:38.084 --> 54:39.185
Fuck loyalty!

54:39.218 --> 54:40.453
This is about our kids.

54:40.485 --> 54:42.221
All those documents,
the refugee statements,

54:42.254 --> 54:44.457
the classified files of
Afghanistan, they're all gone.

54:44.489 --> 54:45.292
Fuck you!

54:45.325 --> 54:46.126
They're all gone.

54:46.159 --> 54:47.227
All right?

54:47.260 --> 54:48.694
I protect my
sources, you know that.

54:48.729 --> 54:51.298
But you won't anonymize a
four year old kid's disclosure?

54:53.033 --> 54:54.368
My daughter has a name.

55:02.243 --> 55:03.478
Widow makers.

55:07.382 --> 55:08.216
Listen, Joel.

55:09.784 --> 55:12.020
You seriously underestimate me

55:12.053 --> 55:14.455
if you think that threats
are gonna force me

55:14.489 --> 55:15.790
to compromise my daughter.

55:15.823 --> 55:16.824
I'm not threatening you, mate.

55:16.858 --> 55:17.760
Well, you could've fooled me.

55:17.793 --> 55:18.994
Look, can we...

55:23.832 --> 55:25.300
When it's cooled down
over a couple of days,

55:25.334 --> 55:26.835
just until the other side
of this launch, that's all.

55:26.869 --> 55:27.770
No, no.

55:27.803 --> 55:28.703
I won't delay getting help for...

55:28.737 --> 55:29.838
Well, there must be some way.

55:29.872 --> 55:32.141
Well, I'm all ears, mate!

55:41.951 --> 55:42.952
All right.

55:47.724 --> 55:50.261
All right, how about this.

55:50.294 --> 55:52.662
You remove the names
off the statement,

55:52.695 --> 55:54.799
and we'll get our kids
assessed privately somehow,

55:54.832 --> 55:56.333
we'll come up with some story.

55:57.735 --> 55:58.536
Including Ethan?

55:58.568 --> 55:59.937
Yeah, sure.

55:59.970 --> 56:01.238
For whatever it's worth,

56:03.140 --> 56:04.674
you need to remove those names.

56:10.816 --> 56:11.649
Okay.

56:13.885 --> 56:14.719
All right.

56:15.619 --> 56:17.055
Well, that could be workable.

56:21.094 --> 56:21.928
All right.

56:25.031 --> 56:26.665
I don't want us to fall
out over this, mate.

56:27.834 --> 56:29.802
Nah.

56:29.836 --> 56:30.635
Me either.

56:35.508 --> 56:36.342
Okay.

56:38.145 --> 56:39.980
Let's go sell this to the girls.

56:40.013 --> 56:41.849
Stop being a
fucking politician.

56:41.882 --> 56:42.816
It's a solution.

56:42.850 --> 56:44.051
No, it's not a solution.

56:44.084 --> 56:45.719
You're just trying
to fix things.

56:45.752 --> 56:48.222
Ethan didn't do anything,
so he doesn't need help.

56:48.255 --> 56:49.957
Ben has not been
abused by anybody,

56:49.990 --> 56:51.191
let alone his own brother,

56:51.225 --> 56:52.692
so he doesn't need any help.

56:52.726 --> 56:54.028
It's a compromise.

56:54.062 --> 56:55.497
I thought we came
here to tell these guys

56:55.530 --> 56:56.931
that Ethan didn't do it.

56:56.965 --> 56:58.333
Wasn't that the bottom line?

56:58.366 --> 56:59.134
Bek.

56:59.167 --> 57:00.335
No, don't "Bek" me.

57:00.368 --> 57:02.170
Why are men so fucking shit?

57:02.203 --> 57:02.971
Oh, here we go.

57:03.004 --> 57:04.005
Not all men.

57:04.038 --> 57:04.939
Thank you.

57:04.973 --> 57:06.040
I wasn't talking about you.

57:07.375 --> 57:10.146
Bek, please, if you're
worried about this getting out

57:10.179 --> 57:11.447
beyond the four of us,

57:11.480 --> 57:13.315
this is a solution.

57:13.349 --> 57:16.085
How do we justify
getting Ethan assessed?

57:16.118 --> 57:17.319
For what?

57:17.353 --> 57:19.388
By making up another
bullshit story?

57:19.421 --> 57:20.856
I'm sure that there's a way

57:20.890 --> 57:22.725
that we can communicate
truthfully what's happened.

57:22.758 --> 57:23.658
What?

57:23.691 --> 57:24.861
The truth according to whom?

57:24.895 --> 57:25.862
Natasha.

57:28.231 --> 57:31.568
I will not put my kids
in therapy, end of story.

57:31.601 --> 57:33.003
I think you're
making a real mistake...

57:33.036 --> 57:34.237
Do you understand
that if my son

57:34.271 --> 57:36.373
had done any of these
things, I could never...

57:42.647 --> 57:43.548
Do what, Bek?

57:45.416 --> 57:49.453
Just leave my children alone.

57:49.487 --> 57:50.855
Ethan needs help.

57:50.888 --> 57:52.590
Ethan didn't do anything.

57:52.623 --> 57:53.925
I think
that in your heart...

57:53.958 --> 57:56.895
He didn't do it, and
that is my final word

57:56.929 --> 57:58.330
on this disgusting allegation!

57:58.363 --> 57:59.531
Okay, I think we're done here.

57:59.565 --> 58:02.935
Wait, wait,
don't go, don't go.

58:02.968 --> 58:03.835
Please.

58:08.173 --> 58:09.208
I need to use the bathroom.

58:09.241 --> 58:10.042
Okay.

58:10.075 --> 58:11.243
But you're coming back?

58:11.276 --> 58:13.980
Fine, but we are
not making any deals.

58:14.013 --> 58:14.847
Okay, fine, please.

58:16.349 --> 58:17.684
Please, please?

58:17.716 --> 58:18.551
Fuck!

58:28.494 --> 58:30.698
Well, that's dead in the ass.

58:34.902 --> 58:38.005
I think I might have
that beer, mate.

58:39.206 --> 58:40.608
IPA or lager?

58:40.641 --> 58:41.442
Lager.

58:44.111 --> 58:45.013
Em?

58:45.046 --> 58:45.914
Yes, please.

59:16.913 --> 59:19.182
Oh, fuck.

59:45.043 --> 59:46.044
Oh, shut up.

59:59.892 --> 01:00:00.727
It's good.

01:00:01.927 --> 01:00:03.362
Local microbrewery.

01:00:05.198 --> 01:00:06.066
It's crisp.

01:00:24.352 --> 01:00:28.790
I came across a pool just
like this outside Teracott.

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:33.594
We'd been tasked to retake
a police checkpoint.

01:00:33.627 --> 01:00:37.699
And there was this
villa, this ruin.

01:00:42.571 --> 01:00:44.873
The pool was bone dry, and...

01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:51.046
I found this man
lying on the bottom,

01:00:56.252 --> 01:00:57.687
hugging the body of his wife.

01:01:02.558 --> 01:01:04.894
I remember he was stroking
her hair like a lover.

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:11.268
He wouldn't let her go.

01:01:21.979 --> 01:01:23.447
Later, much, much later,

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:27.419
the translator
managed to tease out

01:01:27.452 --> 01:01:28.953
a story for his sobs.

01:01:35.627 --> 01:01:38.530
I never heard a
man wail like that.

01:01:42.601 --> 01:01:45.739
The Taliban had forced
him to watch as they

01:01:48.207 --> 01:01:51.878
gang-raped his wife,
cut off her hands,

01:01:51.912 --> 01:01:53.379
and then shot her in the head.

01:01:57.919 --> 01:02:01.188
All 'cause he was a policeman.

01:02:07.762 --> 01:02:09.496
The only reason they
didn't behead him

01:02:09.529 --> 01:02:10.363
was because we got
there just in time.

01:02:16.471 --> 01:02:17.739
Don't think he knew
whether to thank us

01:02:17.773 --> 01:02:20.007
or hate us for that.

01:04:41.424 --> 01:04:42.760
Okay.

01:04:42.793 --> 01:04:44.661
Okay, fuck me.

01:04:44.694 --> 01:04:45.495
When?

01:04:45.528 --> 01:04:46.329
Now.

01:04:46.363 --> 01:04:47.163
When?

01:04:47.197 --> 01:04:47.999
Now.

01:04:48.032 --> 01:04:48.833
Now?

01:04:48.866 --> 01:04:49.834
Fuck me.

01:04:49.867 --> 01:04:50.700
Fuck.

01:04:53.204 --> 01:04:55.139
Oh, fuck.

01:04:55.172 --> 01:04:56.975
Fuck me harder.

01:04:59.111 --> 01:04:59.945
Harder.

01:05:01.046 --> 01:05:02.848
Fuck!

01:05:02.881 --> 01:05:04.850
Oh, fuck.

01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:15.795
Harder!

01:05:15.828 --> 01:05:16.662
Oh, fuck!

01:05:20.066 --> 01:05:20.900
Oh, God.

01:05:32.512 --> 01:05:33.346
Oh, God.

01:05:38.651 --> 01:05:42.123
Oh, fuck yeah.

01:05:43.091 --> 01:05:43.925
Yeah.

01:05:54.803 --> 01:05:55.669
Yeah.

01:05:55.703 --> 01:05:56.638
Oh, fuck.

01:07:23.264 --> 01:07:24.330
Oh, fuck!

01:07:24.364 --> 01:07:25.199
Fuck!

01:07:25.232 --> 01:07:26.366
Oh, fuck!

01:07:26.399 --> 01:07:27.268
I'm gonna cum.

01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:28.735
Oh, God!

01:08:21.524 --> 01:08:22.459
You okay?

01:08:27.765 --> 01:08:29.934
We're almost done here.

01:08:29.968 --> 01:08:31.169
I'm feeling a bit uneasy.

01:08:31.202 --> 01:08:32.937
Could you please
get the car ready?

01:08:34.104 --> 01:08:34.939
Sure.

01:08:57.630 --> 01:08:58.731
Okay, okay.

01:09:15.783 --> 01:09:17.184
Pete, finally.

01:09:17.218 --> 01:09:18.152
I need to resolve this.

01:09:18.185 --> 01:09:19.819
Who's Pete?

01:09:19.854 --> 01:09:20.687
My lawyer.

01:09:21.587 --> 01:09:22.421
Hi, mate.

01:09:25.693 --> 01:09:27.495
10 years old, that's
what I thought.

01:09:30.832 --> 01:09:31.666
Brilliant.

01:09:33.201 --> 01:09:34.036
Okay.

01:09:37.872 --> 01:09:38.874
Hang on a sec, mate.

01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:40.843
Hold on.

01:09:40.877 --> 01:09:41.676
Slow down.

01:09:43.412 --> 01:09:44.247
Yup.

01:09:45.415 --> 01:09:47.216
Veracity of the
allegation, sure.

01:09:49.085 --> 01:09:50.519
Yep, all right.

01:09:52.087 --> 01:09:52.921
Okay.

01:09:57.493 --> 01:09:59.430
That is a relief, thank you.

01:09:59.462 --> 01:10:00.463
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:10:00.496 --> 01:10:01.664
All right, mate.

01:10:01.698 --> 01:10:02.866
Send my love to
Carol and the kids.

01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:04.435
Thank you for taking
the call on the weekend.

01:10:04.467 --> 01:10:05.302
Ciao.

01:10:09.773 --> 01:10:11.708
There's no case to enter.

01:10:11.741 --> 01:10:12.576
What?

01:10:14.112 --> 01:10:16.348
As Ethan is under 10,

01:10:16.381 --> 01:10:17.916
he's not able to commit
an offense by law,

01:10:17.949 --> 01:10:19.317
therefore the
police have no basis

01:10:19.351 --> 01:10:20.986
to take the matter
further, case closed.

01:10:21.019 --> 01:10:22.187
That's bullshit.

01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:23.121
Straight for
the horse's mouth.

01:10:23.154 --> 01:10:24.356
I mean, I'm paraphrasing here,

01:10:24.389 --> 01:10:26.490
but the police have
no cause to determine

01:10:26.523 --> 01:10:27.993
the veracity of the allegation,

01:10:28.026 --> 01:10:29.028
it remains an allegation,

01:10:29.061 --> 01:10:30.729
there will be no investigation.

01:10:30.762 --> 01:10:32.098
Did he actually say that?

01:10:33.265 --> 01:10:34.699
You could start
with an apology.

01:10:36.769 --> 01:10:39.772
So you're gonna
use some legal loophole

01:10:39.805 --> 01:10:41.907
to let your son rape other kids?

01:10:41.941 --> 01:10:43.641
Right,
Emily, they're kids.

01:10:43.675 --> 01:10:46.146
Kids explore, it's
developmental.

01:10:46.179 --> 01:10:47.613
I mean, you're blowing
this all out of proportion.

01:10:47.646 --> 01:10:50.417
The bottom line is,
your allegation...

01:10:50.450 --> 01:10:53.020
My daughter
has been sexually abused.

01:10:53.053 --> 01:10:55.088
And your son did it.

01:10:55.122 --> 01:10:56.390
No.

01:10:56.423 --> 01:10:57.690
What we have is a
nine year old who

01:10:57.723 --> 01:10:58.959
didn't know he would
be in the same room,

01:10:58.992 --> 01:11:00.594
and two four year olds
who can't even agree

01:11:00.627 --> 01:11:03.663
on the simplest of detail...

01:11:03.697 --> 01:11:06.401
Just because
Ethan is under 10,

01:11:06.434 --> 01:11:09.971
it doesn't absolve him
of responsibility...

01:11:23.452 --> 01:11:24.619
You heard her.

01:11:25.854 --> 01:11:28.957
"I wouldn't be able
to look at my son."

01:11:28.991 --> 01:11:30.192
She didn't say that.

01:11:30.225 --> 01:11:32.594
You know damn well
that's what she meant.

01:11:32.628 --> 01:11:34.730
It puts her in an
impossible position!

01:11:34.763 --> 01:11:36.598
Em, your pop psychology
may help your films,

01:11:36.632 --> 01:11:38.600
but it doesn't work here, okay?

01:11:38.634 --> 01:11:40.669
Fuck off!

01:11:40.702 --> 01:11:41.538
Joel?

01:11:43.106 --> 01:11:43.940
It's them.

01:11:46.142 --> 01:11:46.943
What?

01:11:46.976 --> 01:11:48.045
Have a look, play it.

01:11:52.349 --> 01:11:54.318
Oh, fuck yeah.

01:11:55.853 --> 01:11:56.653
Uh...

01:11:56.686 --> 01:11:57.488
What the fuck?

01:11:57.521 --> 01:11:58.389
Oh, shit.

01:12:00.558 --> 01:12:01.792
Shit.

01:12:01.826 --> 01:12:03.626
Where the fuck
did you get this?

01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:04.628
You just left it lying around,

01:12:04.662 --> 01:12:05.464
anyone could've found it.

01:12:05.497 --> 01:12:06.398
Natasha.

01:12:06.431 --> 01:12:08.934
It's very irresponsible, Emily.

01:12:08.967 --> 01:12:09.733
Give me my phone.

01:12:09.767 --> 01:12:11.269
No.

01:12:11.303 --> 01:12:13.105
We have this now, there's
nothing you can do about it.

01:12:13.138 --> 01:12:14.539
It's blackmail.

01:12:14.573 --> 01:12:15.407
Blackmail.

01:12:16.607 --> 01:12:17.843
Why are you doing this?

01:12:17.876 --> 01:12:19.344
I'm doing this to
protect my children

01:12:19.377 --> 01:12:20.913
against your daughter's lies.

01:12:20.947 --> 01:12:21.914
You're sick.

01:12:21.948 --> 01:12:22.747
Her lies.

01:12:22.782 --> 01:12:24.016
This is sick.

01:12:24.050 --> 01:12:24.951
Maybe we're the
ones who should be

01:12:24.984 --> 01:12:25.885
calling child protection.

01:12:25.918 --> 01:12:27.854
Oh my God, that is private.

01:12:27.887 --> 01:12:29.654
I can't believe you
would put that out there.

01:12:29.688 --> 01:12:31.690
It's nasty, mate, and it
really doesn't look that good.

01:12:31.723 --> 01:12:35.361
Okay, this has
nothing to do with

01:12:35.394 --> 01:12:37.431
what has happened to Natasha.

01:12:38.832 --> 01:12:39.833
I think we're
done here, right?

01:12:39.867 --> 01:12:41.068
Give me my phone, Emily.

01:12:41.101 --> 01:12:43.203
No, take that
footage down now.

01:12:43.237 --> 01:12:44.071
Or what?

01:12:45.839 --> 01:12:46.639
Okay, you know what?

01:12:46.672 --> 01:12:48.075
Yeah, we enjoy fucking.

01:12:49.209 --> 01:12:52.480
And we enjoy filming
ourselves fucking.

01:12:52.514 --> 01:12:56.451
And we enjoy watching
films of ourselves fucking!

01:12:56.484 --> 01:12:58.486
Yeah, well, that's not a crime.

01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:01.356
This actually has nothing to do

01:13:01.389 --> 01:13:03.124
with what has
happened to Natasha.

01:13:03.158 --> 01:13:05.160
Please, guys,
this is too much.

01:13:05.193 --> 01:13:06.094
Yeah.

01:13:06.127 --> 01:13:06.928
Emily, give me my phone.

01:13:06.961 --> 01:13:08.164
- No.
- Give it to me.

01:13:08.197 --> 01:13:09.798
Fuck your phone!

01:13:09.832 --> 01:13:11.400
That is criminal damage.

01:13:11.433 --> 01:13:13.469
I feel violated.

01:13:13.502 --> 01:13:15.070
Oh, do you feel violated?

01:13:15.104 --> 01:13:15.938
Do you?

01:13:15.971 --> 01:13:17.139
Do you?

01:13:17.173 --> 01:13:18.340
You don't even know the
meaning of the word.

01:13:18.374 --> 01:13:19.275
I feel, I know!

01:13:20.442 --> 01:13:22.645
You think you've
got so much insight,

01:13:22.677 --> 01:13:25.248
winning your stupid awards,

01:13:25.282 --> 01:13:27.584
leeching off other
people's pain.

01:13:27.617 --> 01:13:29.752
And me, I'm just this
poor little housewife

01:13:29.786 --> 01:13:30.820
whose dreams of being an artist

01:13:30.854 --> 01:13:31.754
are all dried up.

01:13:31.788 --> 01:13:32.688
That's what you think, isn't it?

01:13:32.721 --> 01:13:34.457
I have never said that.

01:13:34.491 --> 01:13:38.061
You can't see inside my head.

01:13:38.094 --> 01:13:38.962
Inside here.

01:13:40.064 --> 01:13:41.532
I have experienced
things that you couldn't

01:13:41.566 --> 01:13:45.436
possibly imagine in your
deepest, darkest nightmares.

01:13:45.469 --> 01:13:47.238
You are the hypocrite.

01:13:47.271 --> 01:13:48.105
Bek.

01:13:48.139 --> 01:13:48.973
Who cares?

01:13:50.074 --> 01:13:51.676
This is about our children.

01:13:53.878 --> 01:13:55.479
After everything that
we've done for you guys,

01:13:55.513 --> 01:13:57.849
and this is how you repay us?

01:13:57.883 --> 01:14:00.018
Oh, you're insane.

01:14:00.052 --> 01:14:01.486
This is insane.

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:04.022
This is a beautiful community
full of lovely people...

01:14:04.056 --> 01:14:05.224
You're fucking insane.

01:14:05.257 --> 01:14:06.124
Who trust each other.

01:14:06.158 --> 01:14:07.259
Okay?

01:14:07.292 --> 01:14:09.294
The way you're behaving
is not conducive

01:14:09.328 --> 01:14:10.529
to a community spirit.

01:14:10.562 --> 01:14:11.363
Yeah?

01:14:11.396 --> 01:14:12.599
What is this?

01:14:12.632 --> 01:14:15.235
Is this the Catholic
church circa 1950?

01:14:16.603 --> 01:14:18.071
This community.

01:14:18.104 --> 01:14:20.039
Nobody makes these
kind of allegations

01:14:20.073 --> 01:14:21.207
in this community, Emily.

01:14:21.241 --> 01:14:22.408
No, they're
slanderous, in fact.

01:14:22.442 --> 01:14:23.343
Slander, you've
lost your mind, mate.

01:14:23.376 --> 01:14:24.644
You haven't got any proof.

01:14:24.677 --> 01:14:27.347
Natasha's words are the proof.

01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:28.882
If you talk to anyone
about these allegations,

01:14:28.916 --> 01:14:29.717
I will sue you.

01:14:29.749 --> 01:14:31.518
Oh yeah, there it is.

01:14:31.552 --> 01:14:32.620
Lawyer time.

01:14:32.653 --> 01:14:35.089
You are a
pathetic, little man.

01:14:35.122 --> 01:14:36.323
Really?

01:14:36.357 --> 01:14:37.825
Yeah, with your
porn addiction,

01:14:37.858 --> 01:14:40.561
and your sham marriage.

01:14:40.594 --> 01:14:44.065
And you take it out on your son.

01:14:44.099 --> 01:14:45.000
You know?

01:14:45.033 --> 01:14:46.968
No wonder Ethan is fucked up.

01:14:47.002 --> 01:14:50.305
You two, you're the
worst kind of parents.

01:14:50.338 --> 01:14:51.139
Are you done?

01:14:51.172 --> 01:14:52.073
No.

01:14:52.107 --> 01:14:53.008
No, I haven't even started.

01:14:53.041 --> 01:14:53.942
First thing on Monday morning,

01:14:53.975 --> 01:14:55.143
I'm gonna call child protection,

01:14:55.176 --> 01:14:56.911
and I'm gonna give them
Natasha's statement,

01:14:56.945 --> 01:14:59.114
and I'm gonna include
all of the names.

01:14:59.147 --> 01:15:01.350
You vindictive little cunt.

01:15:01.384 --> 01:15:03.286
Keep your nose out of
other people's business.

01:15:03.319 --> 01:15:04.453
What was that?

01:15:04.487 --> 01:15:05.254
You need to control
your wife, mate.

01:15:05.288 --> 01:15:06.055
This is a joke, right?

01:15:06.088 --> 01:15:07.523
No, it's not a joke.

01:15:07.556 --> 01:15:08.991
No, it's not a joke, no,
it's a threat, you mongrel.

01:15:09.025 --> 01:15:09.959
I'm gonna fuck both of
you up with that footage.

01:15:09.992 --> 01:15:11.360
Get off my property.

01:15:11.394 --> 01:15:12.662
Name and shame thy...

01:15:12.695 --> 01:15:13.863
What?

01:15:13.896 --> 01:15:14.897
You threaten me
with child protection?

01:15:14.930 --> 01:15:15.731
You threaten me?

01:15:15.766 --> 01:15:17.334
Look at your pool fence!

01:15:17.367 --> 01:15:18.835
What are you talking about?

01:15:18.869 --> 01:15:20.804
It's completely illegal,
it's a fucking child killer.

01:15:22.005 --> 01:15:22.806
I mean, look at your block!

01:15:22.839 --> 01:15:25.475
It's a bushfire hazard.

01:15:25.509 --> 01:15:27.477
And your creek's a disgrace,
your gutters need clearing.

01:15:27.511 --> 01:15:29.913
You have a legal responsibility
to this community.

01:15:29.946 --> 01:15:31.281
You just don't get
it, do you, mate?

01:15:31.315 --> 01:15:32.550
You have had two fucking years

01:15:32.583 --> 01:15:34.018
to sort this place out.

01:15:34.052 --> 01:15:35.720
This community doesn't
need pretenders like you.

01:15:35.753 --> 01:15:38.189
Go and prance around the city
where you fucking belong.

01:15:38.222 --> 01:15:39.357
You're a loony!

01:15:39.390 --> 01:15:40.358
You're a loony!

01:15:40.391 --> 01:15:41.626
I'm calling the police!

01:15:41.659 --> 01:15:42.460
Yes.

01:15:42.493 --> 01:15:43.695
Oh, you fucking idiot.

01:15:43.728 --> 01:15:45.496
We're the ones with
police protection.

01:15:45.530 --> 01:15:48.200
You know, this
actually could've been

01:15:48.233 --> 01:15:53.238
a really lovely,
caring conversation.

01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:57.076
You guys could've
said, "Oh, I'm so sorry

01:15:57.109 --> 01:15:59.578
"about what has
happened to Natasha.

01:15:59.611 --> 01:16:02.981
"God, this must be really
distressing for you guys.

01:16:03.015 --> 01:16:06.086
"You know, let's all work
together to sort out the kids."

01:16:06.119 --> 01:16:10.890
But then, instead, we just
got denial and threats.

01:16:10.924 --> 01:16:15.929
And now the legal speak
about slander and blackmail.

01:16:16.797 --> 01:16:18.365
And it's upsetting, you know?

01:16:18.398 --> 01:16:19.599
It's upsetting,
and it's attacking,

01:16:19.632 --> 01:16:21.535
and it's just nasty.

01:16:21.569 --> 01:16:22.403
The whole thing.

01:16:23.604 --> 01:16:25.506
I actually thought you
guys were our friends.

01:16:26.907 --> 01:16:27.875
It's waterproof.

01:16:30.144 --> 01:16:31.412
Fucking hell.

01:16:33.714 --> 01:16:36.551
And mine's been
recording this travesty

01:16:36.585 --> 01:16:38.887
for the last hour.

01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:39.921
So...

01:16:41.923 --> 01:16:42.891
Yeah.

01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:45.828
I fucking love you.

01:16:45.862 --> 01:16:46.829
Yeah.

01:16:46.863 --> 01:16:48.463
Give me the phone.

01:16:48.497 --> 01:16:49.898
Give me the God damn phone!

01:16:49.931 --> 01:16:51.433
Give me the God damn phone!

01:18:37.412 --> 01:18:39.681
Look at what you've done!

01:18:41.250 --> 01:18:42.518
You're a bad girl!

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:44.053
You're a bad girl!

01:18:45.054 --> 01:18:45.956
Come on, darling.

01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:46.991
We're going.

01:19:08.546 --> 01:19:10.281
Nobody believes me!

01:19:14.151 --> 01:19:15.754
Nobody believes me!
