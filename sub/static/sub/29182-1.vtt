03:19.433 --> 03:22.868
You're so cute,
you're so cute.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.270
I could just eat you all up.

05:21.622 --> 05:22.622
Hello?

05:23.424 --> 05:25.691
Ian, Ian is that you?

05:25.693 --> 05:26.958
It's Mark.

05:26.960 --> 05:30.095
Yeah, it's me.

05:30.097 --> 05:31.029
You're joking, really.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.165
It's been what, ten years?

05:34.601 --> 05:35.834
Something like that.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.136
Yeah, listen, I'm
looking for a room

05:38.138 --> 05:41.973
and I saw you've got one
there up at Dumpling Farm.

05:41.975 --> 05:44.042
That's right, what happened?

05:45.045 --> 05:46.211
It's a long story.

05:46.213 --> 05:48.413
I'll tell you about it.

05:48.415 --> 05:51.850
The room's yours,
if you want it.

05:53.821 --> 05:56.455
When do you uh, want to move in?

05:59.560 --> 06:02.394
As soon as, I'm
just round the corner.

06:02.396 --> 06:03.829
She kicked me out.

06:03.831 --> 06:06.031
Putting it about a bit?

06:07.167 --> 06:08.533
Yeah, it was my fault.

06:10.337 --> 06:13.505
Well, I'll see you
when you get here, mate.

06:15.376 --> 06:17.376
Looking forward to it, pal.

06:17.378 --> 06:18.844
Yeah, nice one, Ian.

06:18.846 --> 06:19.846
You, too.

07:50.838 --> 07:51.838
Hello?

08:02.950 --> 08:03.950
Ian?

08:14.495 --> 08:19.564
Hello?

08:43.490 --> 08:46.958
Oh, Jesus.

08:46.960 --> 08:47.960
Fuck.

08:50.898 --> 08:51.898
Hello?

09:01.441 --> 09:02.441
Ian, hello?

09:09.116 --> 09:10.116
Ian?

09:12.452 --> 09:17.489
Hello, Ian?

09:19.860 --> 09:23.395
Hello?

09:23.397 --> 09:24.229
Ian?

09:29.303 --> 09:30.303
Hello?

09:37.811 --> 09:38.811
Ian?

10:06.406 --> 10:07.406
Hey, Ian?

10:08.742 --> 10:10.041
What are you doing in here?

10:12.913 --> 10:14.679
You really shouldn't
come in here.

10:16.450 --> 10:17.450
It's me, Mark.

10:18.318 --> 10:19.985
I'm coming to stay.

10:22.489 --> 10:23.489
Oh, yeah.

10:25.392 --> 10:29.294
Just give me a minute,
I'm finishing up in here.

10:29.296 --> 10:32.297
Who were you just
talking to now?

10:35.936 --> 10:38.236
I'm just finishing up in here.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.007
Okay, whatever man.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.009
It's cool.

10:45.045 --> 10:46.845
I'll be at the house.

11:24.384 --> 11:27.652
I could
just eat you all up.

11:27.654 --> 11:32.724
I could just eat you all up.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.297
Ah, you've done
the place up a bit.

11:54.715 --> 11:57.382
So, what's the deal
with parties up here?

11:57.384 --> 11:59.384
This place was always
good for a party.

12:03.557 --> 12:07.192
Just broken up with the wife,
I could do with a bit of,

12:07.194 --> 12:10.261
you know, cheering up.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.900
It's not too much to ask
of an old mate, is it?

12:17.738 --> 12:18.738
Sure.

12:20.907 --> 12:24.075
It's not as if anyone can
hear you this far out.

12:27.748 --> 12:28.748
Nice one.

12:30.917 --> 12:31.850
I thought you might've
been going a bit

20:36.936 --> 20:39.737
Just calling about the
party next week, pal.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.739
Do you want me to bring
some of the good stuff?

20:42.609 --> 20:44.041
Good stuff?

20:44.043 --> 20:46.203
Well, you know, I was
thinking about bringing Mandy.

Mandy, who's Mandy?

20:51.517 --> 20:52.883
You bellend, MDMA.

20:59.392 --> 21:01.325
It's been a while, man.

21:01.327 --> 21:03.761
Stuck with misery guts
for the past six years.

21:04.897 --> 21:06.197
Now that I'm back at
the farm with Ian,

21:06.199 --> 21:08.032
I could do with a
bit of a blowout.

21:08.034 --> 21:10.301
She's a fucking lesbian
now, did you know that?

21:10.303 --> 21:12.670
Well, I knew you
could turn a woman.

21:12.672 --> 21:14.305
Definitely time to move on, pal.

21:15.441 --> 21:16.374
Look, we're gonna
have a big one.

21:16.376 --> 21:17.642
All the boys are coming.

21:19.612 --> 21:20.544
All right.

21:20.546 --> 21:22.747
I love ya, you little beauty.

21:22.749 --> 21:23.948
Love you too, bro.

22:39.892 --> 22:40.892
What the?

25:45.378 --> 25:46.510
Jesus Christ.

28:12.625 --> 28:13.757
Get the fuck out of here!

28:13.759 --> 28:15.793
I'm sorry, man, I'm sorry.

28:16.929 --> 28:18.662
I thought you were down here.

28:18.664 --> 28:22.599
And well, whatever you've
got in there, it stinks.

28:23.469 --> 28:24.835
There are flies down here.

28:31.677 --> 28:34.912
You going fishing,
mate, or something?

29:21.894 --> 29:24.361
So where are you from, boy?

29:26.198 --> 29:28.565
Dublin, Ireland, originally.

29:29.635 --> 29:31.101
Just moved back here though.

29:32.338 --> 29:33.338
Whereabouts?

29:34.507 --> 29:38.041
Ah, Dumpling Farm,
do you know it?

29:38.043 --> 29:40.778
Yeah, I've heard
of that place, yeah.

29:40.780 --> 29:43.847
I've heard stories
about that place.

29:46.986 --> 29:48.318
What stories?

30:05.304 --> 30:07.037
Another one, please.

30:19.685 --> 30:20.885
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

30:39.238 --> 30:40.504
How many have you had?

30:42.341 --> 30:44.208
Can I have another
one of those, please?

30:45.311 --> 30:47.110
You, my friend,
are an alcoholic.

30:50.950 --> 30:52.950
Man, I don't feel great.

30:54.053 --> 30:56.119
Don't worry about that, pal.

30:56.121 --> 30:57.421
We'll soon sort that out.

30:58.691 --> 31:00.457
Fuckin' hell, mate.

31:00.459 --> 31:02.459
It's the middle of the
afternoon, do you ever stop?

31:02.461 --> 31:04.795
You're only young once, mate.

31:04.797 --> 31:08.298
I tell you what, I can't
wait for the party.

31:09.501 --> 31:11.835
It's gonna be wicked to
see all the boys again.

31:11.837 --> 31:14.738
It's been too long man, every
cunt's married with kids.

31:18.577 --> 31:20.043
It's not like I don't
wanna settle down,

31:20.045 --> 31:24.014
there's just too much
pussy around to do it yet.

31:25.017 --> 31:27.184
Besides, I'm a
bastard to live with.

31:29.955 --> 31:32.923
I want to wank all
the fucking time.

31:35.694 --> 31:37.227
Do you do that?

31:38.330 --> 31:39.330
No.

31:40.466 --> 31:44.001
It's like I'm addicted
to fucking Pornhub.

31:45.337 --> 31:47.571
- You take card, right?
- Yeah, there's a 1.58 tax.

31:47.573 --> 31:49.907
The other day I literally
contacted my internet service

31:49.909 --> 31:52.409
provider to increase
my bandwidth.

31:52.411 --> 31:53.411
Jesus.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.680
I was getting fourteen
tabs open at the same time.

31:56.682 --> 31:57.848
Is that fine?

31:59.018 --> 32:00.050
Literally, do you
know how long it takes

32:00.052 --> 32:02.252
to get through fourteen tabs?

32:02.254 --> 32:05.188
I'll tell you how long, an hour.

32:05.190 --> 32:07.224
That's how long it took me.

32:07.226 --> 32:08.926
This morning, in fact.

32:08.928 --> 32:11.295
Just cranking out,
no bandwidth issues.

32:11.297 --> 32:13.263
Just feel it, more porn.

32:16.969 --> 32:19.303
I'm not a monster, I get
it over and done with,

32:19.305 --> 32:22.239
finished, get out of there.

32:22.241 --> 32:25.375
I'm literally like, I set
my alarm an hour early,

32:25.377 --> 32:26.810
I'll get my hour in pal.

32:26.812 --> 32:28.779
I'm basing like, my whole
morning around it at the moment,

32:28.781 --> 32:30.380
gonna push a few things back.

32:30.382 --> 32:32.182
But, I'll have my
hot water and lemon,

32:32.184 --> 32:33.850
I'll get my hour in
and then, after that,

32:33.852 --> 32:35.085
I wont even think about it.

32:35.087 --> 32:36.320
It's the best thing about it.

32:36.322 --> 32:37.587
I won't even think about
it till the afternoon.

32:37.589 --> 32:39.256
There's a wealth of
content out there.

32:39.258 --> 32:40.757
It seems pretty good to me.

32:40.759 --> 32:41.692
It's not just me.

32:41.694 --> 32:42.659
It's not just me that does that.

32:42.661 --> 32:44.061
It's an epidemic.

32:44.063 --> 32:45.562
There's a big problem.

32:45.564 --> 32:46.563
I don't have a problem,
but there's a big problem

32:46.565 --> 32:48.565
overall with that kind of thing.

32:48.567 --> 32:50.267
It's what it's come to.

32:50.269 --> 32:52.369
I mean, I'm not,
I think everyone's the same, to be honest.

32:52.371 --> 32:54.671
People just don't talk
about it, that's all.

32:54.673 --> 32:55.673
Very normal.

32:57.977 --> 32:59.343
Anyway, are you sure mate?

33:01.280 --> 33:02.813
It'll sort you out, you zombie.

33:03.649 --> 33:04.649
- No.
- No?

33:05.851 --> 33:06.950
Okay, fuck it then.

33:08.520 --> 33:10.988
Look after my pint,
I'm off to the bog.

33:25.971 --> 33:28.705
I just eat you all up.

33:39.918 --> 33:41.318
What the fuck?

34:14.085 --> 34:15.217
Jesus Christ.

34:23.929 --> 34:24.929
Christ.

34:42.014 --> 34:43.679
- Hey mate, how are you?
- Hey, how's it goin', bud?

34:43.681 --> 34:45.047
This looks mad, man.

34:45.050 --> 34:46.516
How did you find the
time to do all this?

34:46.518 --> 34:48.752
It was all Stevie.

34:53.559 --> 34:56.059
I don't recognize these people.

34:56.061 --> 34:57.061
Hey.

34:58.063 --> 34:59.796
Hey boys,
nice to see ya..

You're mad, you're the addict.

35:45.777 --> 35:47.310
You're only young once, mate.

35:48.881 --> 35:50.614
Not anymore, man.

35:50.616 --> 35:51.681
Not anymore.

It's you.

37:02.354 --> 37:04.588
I dunno how your
heart manages with this.

37:10.028 --> 37:15.031
That's great.

37:23.775 --> 37:25.041
A little something else.

37:26.178 --> 37:30.880
Not too many, just about
150 pills for you guys.

37:30.882 --> 37:31.882
How's that?

38:05.784 --> 38:08.184
Mate.

38:08.186 --> 38:09.186
No.

38:32.444 --> 38:35.945
Where the fuck have
they been all my life?

38:37.549 --> 38:38.549
Fuck knows.

38:39.284 --> 38:40.417
Ian kept them secret.

38:42.521 --> 38:45.889
You know what, he's been acting
really fucking weird lately.

38:45.891 --> 38:48.091
I mean, creeping
the shit out of me,

38:49.161 --> 38:50.694
and now this.

38:50.696 --> 38:52.936
I mean, where would he find
a group of girls like that?

38:54.232 --> 38:57.200
Well, mate, he's not being
a weirdo right now is he?

38:57.202 --> 38:58.535
And he's just turned
up to the party

38:58.537 --> 38:59.936
with a bunch of hotties.

39:01.273 --> 39:04.708
In my eyes, he's a right total
fucking legend right now.

39:09.514 --> 39:11.348
Stevie, what, no, don't.

39:11.350 --> 39:12.350
Stevie.

39:33.505 --> 39:34.505
Ian.

39:40.011 --> 39:41.511
Who are your friends?

39:41.513 --> 39:43.580
Are you not gonna introduce me?

39:43.582 --> 39:45.315
I want to meet
your friends, pal.

46:21.045 --> 46:22.345
Come with us.

46:38.963 --> 46:40.129
Has anyone got a cigarette?

46:40.131 --> 46:41.564
That's all I need.

46:41.566 --> 46:43.566
That'd be the cherry on top.

46:43.568 --> 46:45.434
Here you go, mate.

46:45.436 --> 46:47.503
Cheers, mate.

46:55.547 --> 46:57.113
Nice, man.

47:14.199 --> 47:15.798
What was in those pills, man?

47:17.502 --> 47:18.502
Woo!

47:20.405 --> 47:22.638
Did you do this for us?

47:25.977 --> 47:27.443
Who's this guy?

47:36.387 --> 47:37.387
What is this?

47:41.693 --> 47:44.794
It's like pagan
shit or something.

47:46.664 --> 47:48.164
I like it, man.

47:49.400 --> 47:51.634
It's a special occasion.

47:51.636 --> 47:53.469
You have to mark
special occasions.

47:54.973 --> 47:56.639
Got to make an effort, you know?

48:48.626 --> 48:50.126
Oh, is that food?

49:15.053 --> 49:17.219
That pot smells amazing.

49:17.221 --> 49:19.055
I'm fucking starving.

49:35.840 --> 49:37.340
You're so cute.

49:40.011 --> 49:41.811
I could just eat you all up.

52:32.884 --> 52:34.783
Now I can smell you.

55:03.868 --> 55:05.334
Ah, shit.

58:00.444 --> 58:02.244
Stevie, you're alive?

58:05.516 --> 58:06.849
Stevie, Stevie.

58:10.721 --> 58:12.554
No Mark, I'm dead.

58:14.959 --> 58:16.725
You're just fuckin'
high on drugs,

58:18.028 --> 58:20.195
and the comedown's yet
to come, my friend.

58:22.666 --> 58:24.066
Tell me this isn't
fucking happening.

58:24.068 --> 58:26.168
Please tell me
this is all a joke.

58:26.170 --> 58:27.170
No.

58:28.005 --> 58:29.471
Sorry, pal.

58:29.473 --> 58:31.206
This is really
fucking happening.

58:32.309 --> 58:34.510
And they're witches or
demons or something.

58:35.746 --> 58:37.779
I don't fucking
know what they are.

58:43.521 --> 58:45.921
And I've got no throat left.

58:48.626 --> 58:51.760
Ah, well, it's only a throat.

58:56.367 --> 58:57.399
I'm fine, really.

59:01.205 --> 59:03.639
Oh, well, only young once, mate.

01:10:19.749 --> 01:10:20.749
Mark.

01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:25.820
Just kill me, please.

01:10:31.228 --> 01:10:32.393
Just kill me.

01:13:24.501 --> 01:13:26.501
Mark, you fucking bastard.

01:13:26.503 --> 01:13:29.237
You are never gonna get away.

01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:28.189
We missed you, Mark.

01:15:39.102 --> 01:15:40.034
