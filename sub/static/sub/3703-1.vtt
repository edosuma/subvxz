KAREL RODEN JAN SAUDEK PHOTOGRAPHER
ACTOR No one wants to know the truth.

00:27.201 --> 00:30.322
- How's that?
- People want fantasia.

00:30.921 --> 00:34.281
- Fantasy?
- Fantasia.

00:34.361 --> 00:37.641
I want to know the truth.
The truth is interesting to me.

00:37.721 --> 00:40.201
Hm... painful. We can't torture people.

00:40.281 --> 00:42.641
Life is not a stroll
through the rose garden.

00:42.721 --> 00:46.201
Fine, but we'll rather inflate it a bit, OK?

00:49.281 --> 00:52.361
The wife is in fact
one's closest relative, right?

00:52.441 --> 00:56.081
And to sleep with one's
closest relative is, in fact, incest.

00:56.161 --> 01:01.281
And it's a criminal offense.
So watch out.

01:01.361 --> 01:06.761
Though I do have the feeling that it does
happen sometimes. Chin up. Don't move.

01:09.321 --> 01:11.041
Got it.

THE PHOTOGRAPHER
(Ladies, I urge you to keep cool...!)

01:58.521 --> 02:02.401
- Done. Gorgeous.
- I can't anymore.

02:02.481 --> 02:05.321
- Jan, I really have to pee.
- So run.

02:05.401 --> 02:07.201
Thanks.

02:10.961 --> 02:13.121
Excellent. Beautiful. Done.

02:14.441 --> 02:16.201
Thank you.

02:16.281 --> 02:20.001
Freely inspired by the life of
the famous Czech photographer JanSaudek

02:22.841 --> 02:25.041
THE 90s

02:25.161 --> 02:30.481
Jan lets us peek into
a world of his own desires and fears,

02:30.961 --> 02:34.361
and gradually we arrive
at a world more mysterious,

02:34.441 --> 02:36.441
the world within our very selves.

02:38.201 --> 02:41.561
Could I ask you
for a few words as well, Jara?

02:41.721 --> 02:45.401
Jan, don't give up on who you are.
Be yourself.

02:47.161 --> 02:52.521
Friends, don't worry,
if you feel ill through the exhibition.

02:52.601 --> 02:56.401
Let that nausea go!
The pictures are washable!

02:57.481 --> 03:02.961
But seriously now.
I want to salute every woman in my life

03:03.641 --> 03:09.681
who, strenuously and in vain, tried to
uplift me, sustain me and make me famous,

03:09.761 --> 03:14.721
pull me out of the ditch and
yank me away from other women

03:14.801 --> 03:20.121
simply, to bring me on the right path.
It didn't work.

03:20.201 --> 03:22.801
But there's still time! Don't give up.

03:26.121 --> 03:27.921
- Bravo.
- All the best.

04:11.561 --> 04:13.401
- Hello son.
- Ciao.

04:13.481 --> 04:16.560
- Hi Jan.
- Hello beautiful.

04:17.880 --> 04:21.961
- You already saw the photographs?
- I saw them. -Splendid.

04:22.120 --> 04:24.241
- Hey dad. Ciao.
- Hi.

04:25.761 --> 04:31.161
- Hello. -Are you dating someone?
- We're all friends. I'm not like you. -No?

04:31.241 --> 04:33.041
Would you like one?

04:33.441 --> 04:35.241
No. Thank you.

04:37.441 --> 04:39.241
Klarka, you alright?

04:45.441 --> 04:47.761
- May I offer you?
- Thank you.

04:53.361 --> 04:56.201
- We're leaving.
- I didn't finish my drink.

04:56.281 --> 05:00.641
- You'll have one on our way.
Don't make a scene here. -Me?

05:00.721 --> 05:03.521
- Pardon us. Thanks.
- You're a jealous man!

05:03.601 --> 05:06.081
- Regards.
- Regards.

05:06.161 --> 05:10.401
When are you going to surprise us
with something new, Maestro?

05:10.481 --> 05:13.881
What new?
Shall I photograph helicopters perhaps?

05:13.961 --> 05:17.201
You've moved nowhere
since your last show.

05:17.281 --> 05:21.681
But I'll love to move... like this.
Or perhaps like this.

05:21.761 --> 05:26.321
- Or I can move this way.
- A new direction would be enough.

05:26.401 --> 05:30.841
Every new thing is an old
and well forgotten one. Farewell.

05:31.041 --> 05:32.841
Farewell.

05:33.081 --> 05:37.601
Why, in your opinion, must a creator
always come up with something new?

05:37.681 --> 05:40.001
Creation isn't about records, is it?

05:40.081 --> 05:44.321
If we don't understand something,
we kill it or ridicule it.

05:44.401 --> 05:47.561
Or we silence it with banal demands!

06:04.321 --> 06:07.001
- Daddy! Ciao!
- Wait... Hi.

06:07.841 --> 06:09.641
Hi.

06:10.441 --> 06:12.961
What are you doing? Practicing Yoga?

06:13.681 --> 06:16.001
Did you recall you have a family?

06:17.601 --> 06:20.401
You're painting again? That's good.

06:20.681 --> 06:23.401
My, my... the rare visit.

06:24.001 --> 06:27.721
- Hello.
- So how long you'll stay? -A little while.

06:30.121 --> 06:32.841
Marketa? I had some negatives here.

06:33.841 --> 06:35.641
You know about them?

06:36.601 --> 06:39.601
Did you put my negatives somewhere?

06:46.281 --> 06:48.601
Mom, dad's asking about something.

06:48.681 --> 06:51.961
I had all my negatives here.
Where are they?

06:52.041 --> 06:57.121
- Do you hear what I'm asking?
- He's asking! So he is asking!

06:57.201 --> 07:01.721
- You should confess!
- To what? -To all your filth!

07:01.801 --> 07:04.481
You know what?
Give me back my negatives!

07:06.361 --> 07:08.161
You took them?

07:08.641 --> 07:12.641
First, you pay.
Either you'll live with us or you pay!

07:12.801 --> 07:18.041
I can't anymore, understand? I'm alone
here on everything. Always alone.

07:18.121 --> 07:22.721
I've given you everything. The house
is in your mom's name. What now?

07:22.801 --> 07:25.321
That was our lifesaver!

07:25.401 --> 07:30.001
The commies would've taken it.
You were selling to the West illegaly.

07:30.081 --> 07:32.681
You were all
too happy about at the time.

07:32.761 --> 07:35.321
It wasn't dad's fault he was banned.

07:35.401 --> 07:37.641
- A million!
- What?

07:38.401 --> 07:43.361
A million. I don't want to watch
throwing our money away with the sluts.

07:43.441 --> 07:47.801
- A million, and you can go!
- Look. Can we talk normally, calmly?

07:47.881 --> 07:50.841
- I care about you all.
- Calmly, huh?

07:50.921 --> 07:56.041
- The whole time you're off with sluts!
- Who cares about the sluts.

07:56.121 --> 07:59.161
He takes them around the world,
buys them cars!

07:59.241 --> 08:01.481
You're not normal, get it?

08:01.641 --> 08:03.761
- Mom!
- Please, calm down.

08:06.681 --> 08:09.681
Don't touch her or I'll call the police!

08:11.321 --> 08:13.121
You...

08:38.681 --> 08:43.520
- Hello. I'm Liba Holy.
- Holy Liba. Come in.

08:43.601 --> 08:48.121
- We spoke this morning.
- Yeah? I thought it was someone else.

08:48.201 --> 08:51.361
I'm a bit out-of-it.
Come in, since you're here.

08:51.441 --> 08:55.481
- Why did you call so early...?
- I know you're an early bird.

08:55.561 --> 08:59.601
Girls, Liba - a lady I don't know.

09:01.881 --> 09:03.681
Hello.

09:05.001 --> 09:08.761
Come in and don't you worry,
no one will bite you.

09:08.841 --> 09:10.641
Hmm... hello.

09:12.121 --> 09:14.241
Come in. Some liquor?

09:14.321 --> 09:18.521
- It may trick your shyness.
- I'm not shy.

09:18.601 --> 09:24.401
Not even champagne? Look, the bottle,
in contrast to me, seems very trustworthy.

09:24.481 --> 09:30.681
- No, thanks. I don't drink.
- Are you sick? -I hope not.

09:30.761 --> 09:32.881
- Sit.
- Thank you.

09:33.241 --> 09:37.721
I like being my own boss
and not being bossed by alcohol!

09:37.801 --> 09:41.361
I only drink when I get
something from it. Like sex.

09:41.441 --> 09:47.201
Don't you worry, it won't happen today.
There aren't enough candidates here.

09:47.521 --> 09:49.841
So, how can I serve you?

09:49.921 --> 09:55.241
- You me? Rather how can I serve you.
- Right now? I'm in!

09:55.321 --> 09:57.121
I admire you very much!

09:57.881 --> 09:59.681
That's so sweet.

09:59.881 --> 10:03.121
- I'd love to work for you.
- As a model?

10:03.201 --> 10:06.081
What would you want to do?
Jan has plenty of all.

10:06.161 --> 10:08.521
That depends when. Not always.

10:08.601 --> 10:12.761
- Jan, don't say that.
- Calm down, ladies, calm down.

10:15.801 --> 10:18.561
How about to stop by
for tea and a small talk?

10:18.641 --> 10:22.121
Thanks, but my husband has a gastric flu.

10:22.201 --> 10:24.001
That's a shame.

10:24.561 --> 10:27.801
I wish him calm... meditation.

10:30.721 --> 10:34.921
I'm a good organizer. I'm not
afraid of meeting with authorities.

10:35.001 --> 10:38.681
- I like to arrange stuff.
- Ciao, my girls. Come here.

10:40.801 --> 10:46.281
- Oh, I'll nestle here and...
- Jan, no more photos today?

10:46.361 --> 10:48.161
I don't know. Ask Alice.

10:48.241 --> 10:53.161
- For me this is lost time.
- I'll leave too. -I'm sorry. Don't go.

10:54.681 --> 10:56.761
Girls, I'll escort you. Come.

10:59.281 --> 11:02.681
The girls are here for the shoot.
Are you doing it?

11:02.761 --> 11:05.881
- No. I don't want to do it.
- Then work on the plans.

11:05.961 --> 11:08.481
I have to take it to the gallery tomorrow.

11:08.561 --> 11:13.121
- Christ, can't we postpone it?
- Excuse me. I'm not afraid of any work.

11:13.201 --> 11:15.761
- Even the unpleasant kind.
- Drop it.

11:15.841 --> 11:20.681
- I've no other work than that.
- I'm a village girl. I like physical work.

11:20.761 --> 11:23.961
Do you like teamwork? In a good team?

11:25.241 --> 11:28.281
Where often there are team contacts?

11:29.601 --> 11:31.401
I have a good team.

11:32.761 --> 11:36.281
And very often I call
for general gatherings!

11:36.361 --> 11:39.801
I will not be your audience!
Do you hear me?

11:39.881 --> 11:44.881
- Gathering bulges out... What are you
saying? -I'm too good for this!

11:44.961 --> 11:49.041
Klarka, you've never been
and never will be an audience.

11:53.561 --> 11:55.881
I don't want to be here. No!

11:57.721 --> 12:01.241
I'm canceling today.
Get dressed. No more photos today.

12:01.321 --> 12:05.321
Don't take them from me.
I'm much happier when I'm not alone.

12:05.401 --> 12:07.321
You spoil everything, Alice.

12:09.841 --> 12:13.721
- Jan, where's the toilet?
- The toilet's in the WC.

12:16.761 --> 12:22.121
She wants to do my work. You can't
just hire someone off the street.

12:22.201 --> 12:25.001
Jeez, those kinds they come and go...

12:25.081 --> 12:29.801
Don't waste time with her. You need
to be fit in the morning. Pick me up at 9?

12:29.881 --> 12:32.841
We'll come back here.
And don't drink anymore.

12:32.921 --> 12:34.721
So girls, home. Move it.

12:35.401 --> 12:37.201
Bye... See you... Bye.

12:41.241 --> 12:43.041
You're still here?

12:48.281 --> 12:52.841
- That's it for today you may go, okay?
- You have a water leak over there.

12:53.521 --> 12:57.561
You're a water worker,
a water-witch... a bewitching liar?

12:58.721 --> 13:02.641
I'm studying management.
Water is as costly as gasoline.

13:02.721 --> 13:05.041
Listen, you're somehow dangerous.

13:05.921 --> 13:09.081
Tell me, my dear, who sent you here?

13:11.681 --> 13:15.521
- The KGB?
- They haven't been around for some time.

13:15.601 --> 13:19.041
Not that long. They still have power.

13:19.121 --> 13:22.481
I know you have a lot of
wonderful people around you.

13:22.561 --> 13:25.761
But for some difficult things
a man is on his own.

13:25.841 --> 13:31.201
All things are difficult. Except for easy
women. But even those can be heavy load!

13:31.281 --> 13:36.481
- Do you want me to wash the dishes?
- Let's leave it all till next time.

13:36.561 --> 13:39.081
You'll see, Jan. I'm a good workhorse.

13:42.761 --> 13:44.561
Jan?

13:46.721 --> 13:50.601
So I'll call you tomorrow, okay.
I'm calling tomorrow!

14:03.441 --> 14:05.241
You don't take my call.

14:06.081 --> 14:08.401
I was passing by so I stopped.

14:08.721 --> 14:11.001
- You don't take my call.
- What happens?

14:11.081 --> 14:14.721
A thousand things,
but you only have time for your women!

14:14.801 --> 14:20.081
- Calm down. -I'm not calming down.
- Relax. I'm here purely for work.

14:20.161 --> 14:24.001
Work? It doesn't bother you,
fucking a married man?

14:24.081 --> 14:28.241
- I'm not screwing him!
- You're embarrassing, you scarecrow!

14:28.321 --> 14:33.561
- Pardon me! Step aside!
- Who are you telling "step, aside"?

14:33.721 --> 14:37.001
- I'm telling you...
- Don't let her provoke you.

14:38.201 --> 14:41.561
- Now its my fault, right?
- Come on, Alice.

14:41.641 --> 14:45.481
- Why me? Why just me?
- Alice, I...

14:45.561 --> 14:50.401
I don't deserve it.
I'm the only woman you haven't touched.

14:50.481 --> 14:55.001
I made a point among us
that sex and job don't mix.

14:55.081 --> 14:58.921
But getting my face smashed
for nothing, that's not fair.

14:59.001 --> 15:00.801
I'm very sorry and...

15:02.161 --> 15:04.561
My wife is nervous about me and...

15:05.401 --> 15:07.961
...she's not a bad person, really.

15:08.041 --> 15:10.361
Let me see. I'll help you.

15:10.641 --> 15:13.441
- It's my fault. I'll yank it...
- Ouch...

15:14.241 --> 15:19.161
Yes... and from the little foot
we take off the little stocking.

15:19.281 --> 15:22.721
Show me. I'll wash it here.

15:23.001 --> 15:25.481
I soaked your belt... this...

15:35.761 --> 15:38.681
Alice, you've got a beaver.

15:40.281 --> 15:43.641
You've got a beaver.
Amazing. You never said anything.

15:43.721 --> 15:46.201
Jan...

15:47.241 --> 15:49.321
I've got you. Easy.

15:51.481 --> 15:53.961
Don't move so much. Wait a moment.

15:54.041 --> 15:57.401
- That's it. Ow! That hurts.
- Jan...

15:59.841 --> 16:01.641
Beautiful.

16:04.361 --> 16:06.161
Jan, Jan!

16:06.921 --> 16:10.201
- Jan...
- I never knew.

16:11.281 --> 16:13.001
Wait...

16:13.241 --> 16:15.521
You pig! You pig!

16:15.761 --> 16:18.601
You boar... you pig...

16:21.401 --> 16:24.001
Let go. Alice, let go.

16:24.801 --> 16:26.601
Let go.

16:40.361 --> 16:43.321
- Hello.
- What are you doing here?

16:43.401 --> 16:49.121
- Jan's waiting for me.
- For you? Not likely, bye.

16:54.921 --> 16:57.841
What you're doing? Stop. Alice...

16:59.881 --> 17:03.321
- I'm sorry, the machine's shut down.
- What?

17:03.401 --> 17:05.201
They will restart!

17:06.241 --> 17:09.840
The juice ran out,
the machines' shut down.

17:09.921 --> 17:13.161
- So we'll go with hand crank.
- No.

17:13.241 --> 17:15.040
Okay, fine.

17:22.001 --> 17:25.040
Jan, hello.
I was supposed to come by today.

17:25.121 --> 17:28.601
You were supposed to call today,
my dear, as I remember.

17:28.681 --> 17:33.521
- I'm off to the bank, then I'm
moving something. -So I'll help you.

17:33.601 --> 17:35.401
- Hello.
- Hello.

17:42.841 --> 17:44.641
Here's your money.

17:45.041 --> 17:47.481
I don't want it.

17:47.641 --> 17:49.441
Now, please. Here you go.

17:50.801 --> 17:52.441
Thank you.

17:52.521 --> 17:57.521
You didn't understand dumb thing
what I wanted. Nothing at all.

18:02.641 --> 18:04.441
Jan...

18:06.801 --> 18:08.801
Put the negatives in the trunk.

18:11.801 --> 18:13.601
Jan...

18:28.441 --> 18:31.441
Did you read it? It's not a bad book.

18:33.201 --> 18:36.521
Everyone nowadays writes. Every hooker!

18:36.761 --> 18:39.881
Please, calm down. It's nothing.

18:41.081 --> 18:45.681
Hello, Liba?
It's over now. Can you come for us?

18:45.761 --> 18:47.441
Good evening, Maestro.

18:47.521 --> 18:50.921
I'm Michal Explorer.
I'm writing graduate thesis

18:51.001 --> 18:54.081
"The Intersection of Compulsion
Research and Human Creativity."

18:54.161 --> 18:57.201
The intersection of what? What's it about?

18:57.361 --> 19:02.361
It's a study of how
an artist understands his creation.

19:02.441 --> 19:05.721
Mr. Intersection,
an artist like me is an idiot.

19:05.801 --> 19:08.441
The artist doesn't understand anything.

19:08.521 --> 19:13.721
An artist creates from necessity - so
that from his efforts, he gets beaten up.

19:13.801 --> 19:18.161
- This little snout...
- Stop it. Call me, Mr. Intersection.

19:18.601 --> 19:21.561
- Thank you.
- Come love, come along.

19:23.121 --> 19:25.481
Where did you get so drunk?

19:35.681 --> 19:37.481
What's she doing here?

19:38.121 --> 19:41.161
- I...
- Why does she have your car?

19:41.241 --> 19:44.201
Relax. She helped me move,
so she still has it.

19:44.281 --> 19:47.481
- Why does she have your car?
- She helped me move!

19:47.561 --> 19:53.321
- Where shall we take the miss?
- She's with me, so to my place.

19:53.401 --> 19:55.281
Don't touch me, Lida.

19:55.361 --> 19:58.681
Don't touch me, I'm telling you.
I'll puke on you!

20:01.521 --> 20:03.321
Go. Carefully.

20:03.801 --> 20:07.081
I'll puke on you.
I'll puke on you! Slowly!

20:10.241 --> 20:13.241
- Come here. Give me that.
- I'm gonna throw up.

20:14.041 --> 20:15.841
Christ, Klarka wait.

20:23.361 --> 20:26.041
You're not well. Here's a bucket.

20:27.681 --> 20:29.481
- Watch out, Liba.
- Yeph.

20:34.761 --> 20:36.561
A little more.

20:41.601 --> 20:43.401
Thank you.

20:43.601 --> 20:45.401
Good night.

22:16.481 --> 22:18.281
Sorry...

22:19.121 --> 22:22.201
Enough of this. Jan and I can manage it.

22:22.281 --> 22:24.081
That's cool. I don't mind.

22:25.481 --> 22:27.841
- Well I do, damn it!
- Why?

22:28.761 --> 22:30.761
Get your things and go home.

22:31.681 --> 22:36.561
- And I'm asking why?
- Because I can't stand people who impose.

22:36.641 --> 22:39.641
And who are you to talk to me like that?

22:39.721 --> 22:42.401
You'd be very amazed at who am I.

22:46.201 --> 22:48.001
That's it. Beautiful.

22:48.441 --> 22:50.681
Don't be shy.

22:50.841 --> 22:54.681
You possess so much femininity.
Don't hide it.

22:54.761 --> 23:00.961
Just don't hide it. Show it off. Take hold
of that tender, small breast. And kiss it.

23:01.081 --> 23:03.961
I'm going to photograph it.
Hold it. Good.

23:06.561 --> 23:08.841
I've come up with another image.

23:09.681 --> 23:14.281
Like this, in the corner.
Come, Cleopatra. Hop in there.

23:14.681 --> 23:20.361
Take that... it looks like a spring of
water, pouring between your breasts.

23:20.441 --> 23:25.561
I'll put this here so her hair
doesn't get wet, she's off to the opera.

23:25.641 --> 23:31.481
And with this work-hardened,
rough hand... you scrub her crotch, yeah?

23:34.801 --> 23:41.361
Jan, you received the prestigious
French award, Knight of Arts and Letters.

23:41.441 --> 23:44.681
- I'm a knight.
- Your work's been seen around the world.

23:44.761 --> 23:49.641
You've had very significant exhibitions
and you also publish your books.

23:49.721 --> 23:55.241
I have to ask you: what do you think
of critics and criticism in general?

23:55.321 --> 24:00.401
- Do you know what they wrote after
the opening of Beethoven's Fifth? -No.

24:01.241 --> 24:03.881
"An orgy of cacophony and vulgarity.

24:03.961 --> 24:08.121
Thank God its first performance
will be its last."

24:09.161 --> 24:12.321
A slight error then.
But the artist must suffer it.

24:12.401 --> 24:16.841
Is this the vocation of the critic?
To crush everyone who's got talent,

24:16.921 --> 24:22.161
take away their passion to
create, to generate value.

24:22.481 --> 24:26.681
- They simply forbid creativity.
- Did someone hurt you once?

24:26.761 --> 24:32.161
Chiefly, the women I've met have hurt me.
That's their nature, always they ruin you.

24:32.241 --> 24:36.001
I thought you're
a great admirer of women.

24:36.081 --> 24:40.601
Yes, I absolutely admire
their beauty, their strength.

24:40.681 --> 24:45.681
But a collar of mutual
coexistence is simply destructive.

24:46.761 --> 24:51.121
At least for me.
I'm an excellent target for attacks.

24:51.201 --> 24:53.921
- Why?
- Because I make mistakes.

24:54.001 --> 24:57.041
Then I regret it and fear.

24:57.121 --> 24:58.921
I fear judgment.

24:59.641 --> 25:06.201
It's known about you
that you worship somewhat stout ladies.

25:06.281 --> 25:09.401
- Maybe I'm confused, but I...
- I like that form.

25:09.481 --> 25:11.761
- Not an appetite for the petite.
- No.

25:11.841 --> 25:17.121
It occurs to me that there can be
a connection with your upbringing,

25:17.201 --> 25:21.121
you lived in a concentration camp
because of your mixed origin.

25:21.201 --> 25:26.121
You experienced hunger
and thinness evokes in you misery;

25:26.201 --> 25:32.321
while plump, exuberant faces
could signify joy, abundance, peace?

25:32.401 --> 25:37.761
You're right, pretty lady, but
allow me to add something more natural:

25:37.841 --> 25:41.281
Man isn't a dog, he doesn't eat bones!

25:53.641 --> 25:55.441
Top of the morning, Jan.

25:56.681 --> 26:00.521
Here are the new designs you wanted.

26:00.721 --> 26:03.761
- Thank you.
- And something else. -What?

26:09.361 --> 26:16.041
Your panties are dangerously slitting
your butt. Careful! Not to cut an artery.

26:16.121 --> 26:20.281
They're supposed to be that way.
You should know that.

26:20.361 --> 26:25.361
But please Alice, a normal guy
doesn't need any teasers.

26:25.441 --> 26:30.161
A woman's underpants
should be cotton with long knickers.

26:30.241 --> 26:32.041
Jan...

26:32.161 --> 26:37.921
I ordered you a plane ticket to Amsterdam
for your exhibition. It occurred to me...

26:38.001 --> 26:42.681
- What occurred to you?
- How about going together?

26:42.761 --> 26:45.761
I... I have to make a phone call.

26:49.281 --> 26:51.841
Liba, could you come, please?

26:52.361 --> 26:55.161
Yes, right now. Please hurry!

26:55.241 --> 27:00.961
Liba, darling, only you
can save me from a miserable death.

27:07.721 --> 27:09.521
Amsterdam... chu chu...

27:12.401 --> 27:14.201
Jan...

27:18.881 --> 27:20.681
Jan...

27:20.961 --> 27:23.281
- Nice. Nice.
- Magnificent.

27:23.361 --> 27:26.921
I strip you of these
dangerous panties, yeah?

27:32.241 --> 27:35.281
You must've been around the corner.
- Yeah.

27:35.361 --> 27:37.561
My, you are really resourceful.

27:38.361 --> 27:42.401
Madam, I am enchanted by your charm
or am I titillated by...

27:42.521 --> 27:47.041
...by your tits?
Not at all, you're adorable.

27:47.241 --> 27:50.641
We have a lot to do.
And all before the editorial lunch.

27:50.721 --> 27:53.441
From there
we have to go to your lecture.

27:53.521 --> 27:56.761
What lecture?
I don't know anything about it.

27:56.841 --> 28:00.721
- I do Jan's schedule.
- You're mistaken. I'm doing it today.

28:00.801 --> 28:04.361
No, you're mistaken.
All scheduling goes through me.

28:04.441 --> 28:08.081
- Jan wanted me to arrange this.
- Can you explain it to me?

28:08.161 --> 28:15.001
- Talk to each other.
- I will not talk with just anyone.

28:16.721 --> 28:20.321
I do the schedule!
I'll not work with someone I don't know.

28:20.401 --> 28:25.321
I do the schedule
and I will continue to do it.

28:26.001 --> 28:27.801
Jan?

28:28.201 --> 28:30.001
May I?

28:30.441 --> 28:32.681
What a situation! It's...

28:35.361 --> 28:38.681
I'm sorry for her,
but it can't be helped, right?

28:39.801 --> 28:42.641
Listen, tell me...

28:45.161 --> 28:50.321
I hope you don't have a tooth brush
and nightie in the suitcase.

28:50.401 --> 28:52.961
I don't have a nightie or toothbrush.

28:55.921 --> 28:58.921
I have to leave for a moment. Stay here.

28:59.601 --> 29:01.401
Don't go anywhere.

29:03.441 --> 29:05.241
Wait here for me.

29:06.761 --> 29:08.561
Okay.

29:14.681 --> 29:18.161
No one's taking care of me.
Would you make me a coffee?

29:18.241 --> 29:21.881
Sure, come in.
I'll take care of you, comfort you.

29:31.481 --> 29:33.281
Liba.

29:33.401 --> 29:35.201
Liba, Liba...

29:35.681 --> 29:38.081
Can you use a computer?

29:38.161 --> 29:40.841
- Yeah.
- So get up. I'll dictate to you.

29:43.041 --> 29:44.841
Please.

29:50.001 --> 29:51.801
May I?

29:52.161 --> 29:54.361
So, write: Positive entrance!

29:55.201 --> 29:57.001
Dazzling glow.

29:58.001 --> 29:59.801
Sunny gate of glory,

30:00.521 --> 30:03.841
joyous clamor and my satisfied cry:

30:04.721 --> 30:06.521
I'm in the world.

30:06.801 --> 30:08.601
And already...

30:09.601 --> 30:12.281
...in that first hour of life, I know of

30:13.681 --> 30:19.921
the lots of breathtaking encounters,
love and understanding to come.

30:20.801 --> 30:23.961
And above all else,
I meet women everywhere -

30:24.681 --> 30:26.841
that river from which all drink

30:26.921 --> 30:30.601
and whose grace
is lavished upon us. Nothing compares.

30:30.681 --> 30:33.161
- Got it?
- Nothing compares...

30:34.321 --> 30:40.041
And now the same from a different angle.
Write: Negative entrance!

30:40.121 --> 30:43.641
Blinding, blinding and stinging light.

30:46.361 --> 30:48.161
Wailing and din all about.

30:49.961 --> 30:53.561
Suddenly I become
a stranger in my own land.

30:53.641 --> 30:58.361
Weeping, I clearly perceive
how cruel life will be,

30:59.081 --> 31:02.841
what slights, humiliation
and misery I'll experience,

31:02.921 --> 31:07.241
arrogant rejection
from noble and poor alike.

31:07.321 --> 31:11.241
Among all these sufferings,
I've forgotten what tortures me.

31:11.321 --> 31:15.001
I bring to mind the women
I've met on the way,

31:15.961 --> 31:20.321
who, like all the others,
will harass me to madness.

31:20.961 --> 31:24.161
To each one, I speak to you.

31:25.721 --> 31:28.721
To each one, I speak to you. Got it?

31:30.001 --> 31:31.801
Thank you.

31:32.521 --> 31:37.921
Do you only take photos with old cameras?
Are you going to try digital cameras?

31:38.001 --> 31:40.001
When I'm infirm, I'll try it.

31:40.881 --> 31:44.321
- Next question?
- Do you have a credo to live by?

31:44.401 --> 31:47.081
Of course. Never stop.

31:47.481 --> 31:51.041
Because once you stop,
you'll never start again.

31:51.121 --> 31:55.961
You must progress - another meter
and you'll find the treasure.

31:56.041 --> 32:00.201
- What kind of films do you like?
- I like porn.

32:00.281 --> 32:02.961
In porn, there's always a happy ending.

32:06.321 --> 32:10.601
Have you ever failed during love-making?

32:10.681 --> 32:15.041
Many times. But I always
find my tongue somehow.

32:20.161 --> 32:23.521
- Jan?
- Wow, you're still here?

32:23.761 --> 32:26.481
It was a mess here,
I sorted it out your way.

32:26.561 --> 32:30.841
I found letters from the tax office
and the police. It could be a trouble.

32:30.921 --> 32:33.961
It will be a trouble.
Who would write me pleasant thing?

32:34.041 --> 32:40.161
It's always some summons or penalty,
courts, fines. I don't give a damn.

32:40.721 --> 32:42.521
Thanks.

32:43.841 --> 32:46.361
You're done for the day. Bye.

32:46.481 --> 32:49.201
I'm not going to let
any bad news to you.

32:49.281 --> 32:52.401
I wanted to ask you
about that picture. Who is it?

32:52.481 --> 32:58.161
You don't recognize it? Once
in a bad mood I painted this monster.

32:58.241 --> 33:01.961
As a self-portrait.
But no one could figure out what it is.

33:02.041 --> 33:03.841
Marek...

33:04.881 --> 33:07.921
Let's see you look at it! Who is it?

33:08.001 --> 33:09.801
Daddy!

33:10.201 --> 33:13.681
Don't underestimate the kids.
It's dangerous to lie to them.

33:13.761 --> 33:16.721
- You had children so early?
- Yeah, I did.

33:16.801 --> 33:20.441
That's it, my Madonna,
beautiful Madonna.

33:20.521 --> 33:24.881
At me... look at me.
That's it. Look beautiful.

33:24.961 --> 33:26.761
Come...

33:30.121 --> 33:32.441
A little more my way.

33:32.521 --> 33:35.201
- State police!
- In the name of the law!

33:37.001 --> 33:42.001
- Where are you going? -Who are you?
- I'm his wife. -She's my wife.

33:42.081 --> 33:43.921
Do you have a warrant?

33:44.001 --> 33:48.281
- Get dressed. You're coming with us.
- Watch out with those negatives!

33:48.361 --> 33:50.961
- Calm down!
- Don't touch him!

33:51.281 --> 33:53.681
- Please, leave him alone!
- Move!

33:56.841 --> 34:01.761
- The gentlemen are well-mannered,
aren't they? -Take him away!

34:01.841 --> 34:07.401
- Where are we going? -Interrogation.
- What kind of interrogation? -Move it!

34:10.721 --> 34:14.360
Then I got 12 months hard labor
for distribution of pornos,

34:14.440 --> 34:18.121
capitalist manners
and propagation of Zionism.

34:18.201 --> 34:22.241
- That's horrible. -Nothing compared
to how they treated others.

34:22.321 --> 34:26.960
- How did your wife take it?
- Bravely. Don't you want to stop?

34:27.041 --> 34:32.721
Then everything slowly started to change.
They didn't want my pictures anywhere.

34:32.801 --> 34:37.161
I can't take it any longer.
We have nothing. I can't buy anything.

34:37.241 --> 34:41.920
I'm sorry, but you have to find
a different, normal job.

34:42.001 --> 34:43.801
Hey... Are you there?

34:46.801 --> 34:49.601
A horrible feeling
to know nobody wants you

34:49.681 --> 34:53.681
- and you can't support your family.
- Hungry kids.

34:54.761 --> 34:58.201
Until today I regret
when my wife and kids came

34:58.281 --> 35:00.681
and I didn't open the door.

35:05.201 --> 35:09.441
Then it was only remorse after remorse,
and ire and hatred.

35:09.521 --> 35:12.481
Before long, my dear wife
got herself a suitor

35:12.561 --> 35:17.801
who walked as if he'd been
stepping through shit. Like this and this.

35:24.281 --> 35:27.081
Don't be sad. It's good.

35:28.161 --> 35:31.001
Then he started throwing darts
into my pictures

35:31.081 --> 35:36.881
and, before long,
they changed the lock in our flat.

36:11.761 --> 36:16.481
Don't forget that I worked
at a factory as a manual laborer.

36:16.561 --> 36:20.721
At that time,
they called it photo-reproduction.

36:21.881 --> 36:24.841
It was hard work.
That job doesn't exist anymore.

36:24.921 --> 36:27.241
- Why'd you do it?
- Why, why...

36:27.321 --> 36:30.321
Because I had to
support myself somehow.

36:30.401 --> 36:33.041
I needed an official stamp
that I had a job.

36:33.121 --> 36:39.001
Without it, I would've been jailed for
sponging. That's how it went at that time.

36:39.081 --> 36:40.881
I worked there 30 years!

36:43.841 --> 36:46.841
And at night,
I shot and shot and shot.

36:48.481 --> 36:50.721
You have beautiful eyes.

36:52.161 --> 36:58.001
Who could've guess that those moldy walls
would become so crucial for me?

36:58.081 --> 37:02.241
An American gallery owner
found me there, Madame Baruch.

37:02.321 --> 37:06.041
She wanted to know the cost
to destroy the studio that way.

37:06.121 --> 37:12.801
Then she bought two pictures,
and then another and another.

37:12.881 --> 37:17.881
That time, Destiny, in the guise of
Good Fortune, walked in my poor door.

37:20.401 --> 37:22.401
Shortly, life changed for me.

37:46.281 --> 37:49.961
Great. Let's tighten
that corset a bit more.

37:50.041 --> 37:53.041
- Hello. I'm Liba.
- Eva. Pleased to meet you.

37:53.121 --> 37:55.801
- I'm the new assistant here.
- Jan, hi.

37:56.521 --> 37:59.321
Eva, hi. I'm glad you came.

38:00.481 --> 38:05.441
- Let's shoot now. -Not today.
- Why not? -It bothers Marek.

38:05.521 --> 38:08.041
Glad to see you, son. Come by more often.

38:08.121 --> 38:12.401
- I don't feel the demand. -Make first
an offer. The demand will follow.

38:12.481 --> 38:15.601
He's such a grump.
You have to wean him off it.

38:15.681 --> 38:18.321
It won't happen. He takes after his mom.

38:18.401 --> 38:21.481
You know everyone.
You probably don't know Michal.

38:21.561 --> 38:25.641
- Michal Explorer.
- He researches how creation is created.

38:27.281 --> 38:29.161
Would you like a coffee?

38:30.841 --> 38:33.681
Come ladies, we'll do that second picture.

38:35.721 --> 38:37.521
Here, on this side.

38:38.161 --> 38:39.961
Katka, you stand here.

38:41.721 --> 38:46.881
- Katka... over your head like that...
- It's unbelievable.

38:50.841 --> 38:52.641
So, this is set.

38:54.841 --> 38:59.401
Nice. Basically the same,
we'll only show the breasts more. OK?

38:59.481 --> 39:04.321
We have to put it below the titties.

39:04.401 --> 39:08.281
Explorer, I have a favor to ask you.
Would you model for me?

39:08.361 --> 39:10.921
I'll put you in my photo.

39:11.001 --> 39:12.801
Sit here.

39:14.161 --> 39:17.481
Take off your jacket and shirt, please.

39:17.561 --> 39:19.361
That's good.

39:19.681 --> 39:23.241
- Jan, telephone.
- Liba, help me here.

39:23.401 --> 39:26.441
It's an unknown number.
I'll call it back later.

39:26.521 --> 39:29.321
- I'm supposed to sit here and stare?
- I am.

39:29.401 --> 39:31.641
- I've seen this a many times.
- I love it.

39:31.721 --> 39:35.041
I'll leave this here... I'll do it, Liba.

39:35.841 --> 39:42.041
I know how to go about it. No one
knows who's actually looking at him.

39:42.121 --> 39:43.921
That's it.

39:45.001 --> 39:46.801
It looks very nice.

39:47.241 --> 39:50.241
And I'll... I'll grab it like this.

39:50.321 --> 39:53.201
You see how inventive you are?

39:53.281 --> 39:56.441
And squeeze it a bit.

39:56.601 --> 40:01.361
And the same way with your right hand.
Squeeze that little butt.

40:01.441 --> 40:04.801
And try like this... Drop the head...

40:04.881 --> 40:08.801
...with suffering,
under the entire burden of the womanhood.

40:08.881 --> 40:12.321
Simply an exhausted human being.
Beautiful.

40:12.841 --> 40:14.641
Now don't move.

40:15.321 --> 40:18.841
- Okay then, are you ready?
- Yeah. We're ready.

40:18.921 --> 40:22.881
Katka, you too.
We're doing the last shot now, okay?

40:22.961 --> 40:26.161
Carefully.

40:31.121 --> 40:32.921
Nicely. Good. Perfect.

40:33.841 --> 40:35.561
Okay?

40:35.641 --> 40:39.001
One moment. I'll put this on.

40:41.001 --> 40:42.801
Like this.

40:43.561 --> 40:48.081
Here, like this. Good... Take it away.

40:48.721 --> 40:54.041
And a bit like that. Perfect.
No, no, straight. That's it.

41:27.881 --> 41:29.681
Jan?

41:30.081 --> 41:31.881
Good morning!

41:39.001 --> 41:40.801
Hello.

41:49.841 --> 41:53.201
- Are you there?
- Yes. I'm working, developing.

41:53.281 --> 41:56.121
- I'll make something good, okay?
- Yes.

42:01.641 --> 42:03.841
My God! Are you alright?

42:04.081 --> 42:08.001
Ma'am, are you all right?
What are you doing? It's utterly cold.

42:08.081 --> 42:12.161
- Leave me, I just wanted to
wash up a little. -Come out, please.

42:12.241 --> 42:15.121
- Stand up.
- Wait.

42:15.481 --> 42:17.281
Stand up!

42:17.641 --> 42:22.161
Hold on. You're completely cold.
You could have drowned!

42:22.241 --> 42:24.041
Jan, come give me help!

42:25.041 --> 42:28.001
Wait. I'll do it alone. Going to sleep.

42:28.081 --> 42:31.361
- Get dressed.
- I'll do it myself. Going to sleep.

42:31.441 --> 42:33.401
- Whose is this?
- No.

42:33.481 --> 42:35.281
Liba, watch out.

42:35.441 --> 42:38.561
Liba, watch out.
You can kill yourself here

42:40.201 --> 42:45.681
Where've you been?
The girls wanted to know you better.

42:45.761 --> 42:50.561
To discuss spirituality. Between
the sheets, to broaden your horizons.

42:50.641 --> 42:52.841
I'm not into women.

42:52.921 --> 42:56.801
I am! We don't understand each
other on this. Have you tried it?

42:56.881 --> 43:01.761
- No. -So you're still a virgin, then.
Would you do something for me?

43:01.841 --> 43:05.681
You have to shoot those athletes.
Should I set an appointment?

43:05.761 --> 43:07.561
Liba...

43:08.121 --> 43:12.201
- Kiss the girls. -The appointment.
- Katka, come here. Please.

43:12.281 --> 43:15.921
- I don't want to.
- Give the girl here a kiss. Please.

43:16.001 --> 43:20.601
- I don't want to.
- I want. Here, one little kiss like this.

43:20.681 --> 43:24.801
One more, and a little lower.
Wait. One more, a teeny one.

43:24.881 --> 43:27.281
No. Enough. I've got a lot of work.

43:27.361 --> 43:29.761
- No, no, no.
- Liba... -No.

43:30.201 --> 43:31.921
Yeah, okay fine.

43:32.001 --> 43:35.401
- Come, girls. Let's go home.
- Where's my bra?

43:35.481 --> 43:37.961
Let's get up! Hop, tushie, up.

43:40.081 --> 43:45.121
- Are we going home, then?
- I'll try to find it. Got it.

43:46.201 --> 43:50.201
Got it. How'd you get there, little one?

43:50.521 --> 43:52.561
Wait. It's all tangled...

43:56.361 --> 43:59.401
Jesus'n'Mary! Jesus, that's marvelous!

43:59.481 --> 44:01.281
That's marvelous!

44:02.721 --> 44:06.041
I'll do it. I simply can't wait.

44:06.121 --> 44:08.121
Look out. Just me. Just me.

44:09.601 --> 44:12.481
- So... are they there?
- Just about.

44:12.561 --> 44:14.361
So, girls...

44:19.361 --> 44:22.321
- Where's your skirt?
- I don't know.

44:23.281 --> 44:26.121
Where is that skirt? Oh, here...

44:26.601 --> 44:31.721
- And also a purse.
- A purse? I don't know where the purse is.

44:31.801 --> 44:35.721
- Yuck! There's vomit here!
- What do you mean, vomit?

44:35.801 --> 44:37.601
- Where?
- Right here.

44:38.161 --> 44:42.881
I don't know. Maybe someone puked,
so what? The ladies are clean.

44:42.961 --> 44:45.961
They wash regularly,
once a week... like me.

44:46.041 --> 44:50.601
Fear not, Liba,
hygiene is carried out regularly!

44:52.001 --> 44:56.121
We change our underwear punctually.
Amongst ourselves.

44:56.201 --> 45:01.521
Your scholar wouldn't lie
on these sweaty, puke-stained sheets.

45:01.601 --> 45:05.961
She already lay here, among
other things, and she never complained.

45:06.041 --> 45:09.921
I don't understand at all.
I give her money and she keeps calling.

45:10.001 --> 45:13.801
Everyone wants something from you,
always bothering you.

45:13.881 --> 45:17.361
- I don't answer and they call back.
- Here, I'll deal with it.

45:17.441 --> 45:22.121
- I don't have my glasses!
- I need my glasses.

45:22.201 --> 45:25.761
- Where'd you have them last?
- I don't know.

45:25.841 --> 45:27.641
Someone's ringing!

45:28.961 --> 45:30.761
That's my illuminati.

45:40.201 --> 45:42.001
Like clockwork.

45:43.201 --> 45:45.201
This is Liba, my new assistant.

45:46.281 --> 45:51.121
This is the Doctor of Philosophy
in Bohemian Linquistics, Madame Zilova.

45:51.761 --> 45:53.561
Have fun, Jan.

45:56.721 --> 46:00.041
I don't have to know every Jane
passing through your door.

46:00.121 --> 46:02.121
So many have, right?

46:02.201 --> 46:07.401
She's very efficient. She manages all my
affairs, puts everything in order for me.

46:07.481 --> 46:11.281
She's not like Alice. She was
depressing, she disheartened me.

46:11.361 --> 46:14.401
She is a keeper. She's a workhorse.

46:14.481 --> 46:18.161
You should send her away soon.
I don't like to meet any of them.

46:18.241 --> 46:21.521
- They're all airheads and bimbos.
- What bimbos?

46:21.601 --> 46:24.881
She's no bimbo. She's presentable.
Some music?

46:24.961 --> 46:27.641
Really? I should inspect her.

46:28.161 --> 46:30.561
- Wait.
- So come, come, come.

46:31.041 --> 46:33.521
Come. Come to me.

46:34.641 --> 46:37.881
- Heel.
- Wait... so...

46:39.361 --> 46:41.881
- Would you like a glass?
- No. I came by car.

46:41.961 --> 46:44.961
- I'll have something.
- Stop talking already.

46:45.041 --> 46:49.401
- I've already stopped and am drinking.
- You can only neigh.

46:49.481 --> 46:51.281
That's it! Come.

46:51.521 --> 46:54.401
- I have an excellent salami.
- I don't want it.

46:54.481 --> 46:59.041
I won't pig out before!
And you know I don't eat meat.

46:59.121 --> 47:03.841
- In 30 years I've never seen you eat!
- You going to make evil eyes at me?

47:04.281 --> 47:06.681
And the cruel face?

47:07.361 --> 47:12.841
You women like it, don't you?
When a man roars, when he's like a tiger.

47:12.921 --> 47:15.801
- That he spits blood.
- That he's sweaty.

47:15.881 --> 47:18.921
But such a man also needs
sometenderness.

47:19.001 --> 47:23.561
- No time for tenderness.
- Understanding, love. Let's have a chat.

47:25.161 --> 47:26.961
So chat.

47:28.001 --> 47:32.761
How go your studies
for your next degree as a...

47:32.841 --> 47:36.361
- Shut up!
- So, let's get to it! -Excellent.

47:38.521 --> 47:40.441
- Let's hurry!
- So...

47:46.041 --> 47:47.841
More! More!

47:49.121 --> 47:50.921
Come.

47:54.081 --> 47:55.881
That's not working.

48:14.801 --> 48:16.601
This is excellent.

48:17.401 --> 48:20.801
You have a superb,
sophisticated style, darling.

48:20.881 --> 48:23.201
I'll edit it for you at home.

48:24.561 --> 48:26.361
Don't leave.

48:28.041 --> 48:29.841
Bye-bye, Jan.

48:30.601 --> 48:34.241
- Do you hear me?
- Let's call each other. -I'm lonely!

48:34.321 --> 48:37.561
Exceptional people
always feel lonely, love.

48:38.921 --> 48:43.721
- That's bullshit.
- It was beautiful. You're an animal.

48:44.641 --> 48:46.441
And be good!

48:51.321 --> 48:56.081
I know this place. It's from your famous
picture, "Naked Woman Over The City".

48:56.161 --> 49:01.161
Yeah, that was my first wife.
And the third seized the negative.

49:34.001 --> 49:39.081
I have to tell you that your morning's
deed gave me a tremendous feeling

49:39.161 --> 49:43.041
because, most of all,
it is the action what counts

49:43.121 --> 49:44.921
no pointless talk.

49:46.721 --> 49:51.121
You're an excellent model.
I'm going to make a big star out of you.

49:51.201 --> 49:55.761
Jan, would you teach me this?
I'd like to be able to do it.

49:55.841 --> 49:58.921
Could I possibly photograph you? May I?

50:04.601 --> 50:08.841
- Liba, who can pee farther, yeah?
- How am I to pee farther?

50:08.921 --> 50:11.961
You gotta... pull the panties to one side.

50:12.041 --> 50:16.721
Strech it a bit and push your twat up.

50:16.801 --> 50:21.561
Look at how you pee. Generally speaking,
all you girls pee further than me.

50:21.641 --> 50:25.361
- I pissed on myself!
- You're pissing on me, Liba!

50:49.441 --> 50:54.521
- Which of my pictures do you like
the most? -I can't say I like any of them.

50:55.121 --> 50:58.561
- What did I do badly?
- Nothing badly, you did what you feel.

50:58.641 --> 51:01.801
Probably, you don't feel anything.

51:01.881 --> 51:04.481
You shoot it for the look.

51:04.561 --> 51:08.961
You have to try to tell some story,
something from you, some weakness

51:09.041 --> 51:12.241
or longing or love, pain, woe.

51:21.881 --> 51:23.681
Jan...

51:27.401 --> 51:29.201
Jan...

51:40.441 --> 51:44.561
- What?
- No one's here. You're dreaming.

51:44.641 --> 51:48.521
- They're everywhere.
- It was only a dream. No one's here.

52:00.721 --> 52:04.681
No one's here. I chased them all away.

52:10.441 --> 52:12.241
- Hi!
- Greetings!

52:12.321 --> 52:14.121
Hi Liba.

52:14.801 --> 52:17.801
ONE YEAR LATER

52:19.521 --> 52:21.321
Hi.

52:25.001 --> 52:27.441
Come here, my little Liba.

52:27.521 --> 52:29.121
- Hi, Liba.
- Daddy!

52:29.201 --> 52:32.761
- This is Jan. This is from us.
- Thank you very much.

52:32.841 --> 52:34.641
Holy. Pleased to meet you.

52:35.881 --> 52:38.681
- This is my mother.
- Hola. -And sister.

52:38.761 --> 52:43.081
- Still a Holy for now.
- I have... -It's gorgeous.

52:43.241 --> 52:46.961
- You should love it, it's pricy.
- Jesus truly loves you.

52:47.041 --> 52:50.201
- Liba, that's a nice car.
- Jan bought it for me.

52:50.281 --> 52:54.761
If only my simple "Thanks" could
resonate in his ears like a fine gem.

52:54.841 --> 52:58.641
- Sis, what are you mumbling?
- Those are all my cousins.

53:01.681 --> 53:04.921
Nice to see you, Holy. Excuse me, Auntie.

53:05.641 --> 53:09.041
- Holy.
- All are the Holy here.

53:25.721 --> 53:29.881
How can you let him photograph you
naked? Such a disgrace.

53:29.961 --> 53:32.281
What do people say about it?

53:32.361 --> 53:35.361
Being naked isn't bad.
That's the way God made us.

53:35.441 --> 53:40.441
So what? You're some model?
A respectable girl doesn't do that.

53:40.521 --> 53:43.241
And you call yourself a good Christian?

54:26.721 --> 54:28.521
Oh no...

54:30.201 --> 54:33.121
What did you promise me?
Leave my mom alone.

54:33.201 --> 54:37.681
You said not your sister,
but nothing about your mother.

54:37.761 --> 54:39.561
Mommy...

54:50.921 --> 54:56.041
The Holy.
Absolutely all the Holy are here.

54:58.841 --> 55:00.641
Hello!

55:03.041 --> 55:05.041
I'm here regarding the fuck!

55:06.201 --> 55:08.001
What?

55:08.121 --> 55:11.321
Said the Count alongside...

55:11.401 --> 55:14.081
What? I'll kill you.

55:14.921 --> 55:20.281
It would be a beautiful death, if you'd
crush my head with your beautiful derrière

55:20.361 --> 55:22.721
Jesus really loves you, doesn't he?

55:22.801 --> 55:26.161
A good Jewish boy worked hard for love.
Let's sing.

55:26.241 --> 55:28.161
What kind of man are you?

55:28.241 --> 55:30.641
Come on, let's sing along:

55:30.721 --> 55:33.961
My dear travelled...
What? You know it.

55:36.081 --> 55:41.321
- So, let's sing along.
- ...my sweet maiden, to Bavor.

55:41.841 --> 55:43.641
Tra-la-la to Bavor.

55:43.961 --> 55:46.161
Tra-la-la to Bavor.

55:46.681 --> 55:50.521
And she tore her box,
her gash, her hole, her twat,

55:50.601 --> 55:53.961
the beaver near her butt over a pail.

55:54.201 --> 55:58.561
Tra-la-la over a pail,
tra-la-la over a pail.

55:59.201 --> 56:03.441
The sauerkraut is sour, the carrot sweet.
The front is hairy, the butt sleek.

56:03.521 --> 56:07.001
And I plough my dear alone.

56:08.361 --> 56:10.161
What...?

56:11.721 --> 56:13.561
Jesus'n'Mary.

56:17.001 --> 56:19.401
- Flowers.
- Yeah. Stay outside.

56:21.001 --> 56:22.801
Marketa?

56:28.481 --> 56:30.281
How do you feel?

56:37.121 --> 56:38.921
Hello.

56:40.401 --> 56:42.201
Give me...

56:45.281 --> 56:47.081
I'm going to see the doctor.

56:49.161 --> 56:53.081
- Come with me. Don't stand around here.
- Yeah, yeah.

56:55.161 --> 56:56.961
I'm sorry, you feel worse.

56:58.281 --> 57:01.481
You have the rest of
Jan's negatives, return it.

57:01.561 --> 57:04.561
- It would be beneficial for us all, no?
- Out.

57:07.241 --> 57:09.041
Out!

57:15.921 --> 57:20.721
- Are we expecting someone? -That could be
the crew, about the documentary.

57:20.801 --> 57:22.601
- No.
- What "No"?

57:24.601 --> 57:27.481
- I'm not here.
- It's agreed upon.

57:27.561 --> 57:32.361
- Don't open. I'm not home.
- How can I not open... Jan...

57:32.441 --> 57:35.761
- I'm going to open it. It's agreed upon.
- I'm not here!

57:35.841 --> 57:38.601
Hello and welcome. Come in, please.

57:41.921 --> 57:43.721
Jan!

57:43.921 --> 57:47.601
- Here is where you should set up.
- Jan, come and join us.

57:47.681 --> 57:50.241
He's probably hiding. Jan!

57:51.441 --> 57:54.041
Jan, come on! They're waiting.

57:57.361 --> 58:01.561
Welcome, ladies.
I apologize. Today it won't work.

58:01.641 --> 58:06.841
- We must move it to another time.
- Another time? But we're agreed on today.

58:06.921 --> 58:11.881
- I'm not feeling very well.
- You can't do this to us. Ms. Liba...

58:14.401 --> 58:18.601
- I'm telling you I don't feel well.
- Ms. Liba, please persuade Jan.

58:18.681 --> 58:22.921
- We don't have another day.
- I apologize, Jan isn't feeling well.

58:23.001 --> 58:26.921
We have a family problem.
Jan has a seriously ill wife.

58:27.001 --> 58:32.361
Jan, I don't want to ask you
anything uncomfortable.

58:32.441 --> 58:35.721
Just maybe about
your childhood and adolescence.

58:35.801 --> 58:39.721
Childhood? That terrible time,
which everyone adores?

58:39.801 --> 58:44.241
When everyone orders you about and
you understand nothing? No, thank you.

58:44.321 --> 58:48.041
- I apologize you have to go.
- Your childhood...

58:48.121 --> 58:51.921
- I'm not well. Respect that.
- You think that was caused by the war?

58:52.001 --> 58:56.961
That was but one thing. The second thing
was my tremendous desire for pussy

58:57.041 --> 59:03.001
but it never occurred to any owner of
pussy to comfort me by spreading her legs.

59:03.081 --> 59:06.441
Would you spread your legs for me, ladies?

59:06.521 --> 59:09.601
It takes so little to make you happy?

59:09.681 --> 59:13.081
Sometimes yes.
What are you smiling about?

59:13.161 --> 59:14.961
Wait a moment.

59:16.001 --> 59:19.041
I truly apologize. Please don't be angry.

59:19.121 --> 59:21.681
Here's a present... as an apology.

59:22.561 --> 59:26.761
My, it's magnificent.
Really, I can't accept this.

59:26.841 --> 59:30.881
If you like this, take it. I'll scribble
something for you next time.

59:30.961 --> 59:35.761
I accept it with your promise that
next time we'll get through the interview.

59:35.841 --> 59:41.001
I promise we'll get
through it next time. Good-bye.

59:48.841 --> 59:53.401
Miss director! I apologize
but I have to take back the painting.

59:53.481 --> 59:56.521
Tomorrow it's traveling to an exhibition.

59:56.601 --> 01:00:00.681
I can give you this smaller one instead.
It's of the same value.

01:00:00.761 --> 01:00:04.801
Thank you. But please, the interview.
I'm counting on you.

01:00:04.881 --> 01:00:08.121
- I'm thinking about it. Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

01:00:10.041 --> 01:00:14.641
Jan, you specifically said
that this painting is good.

01:00:14.721 --> 01:00:17.441
I gave her the one you don't like much.

01:00:17.521 --> 01:00:21.001
- How could you take that liberty?
- What?

01:00:21.081 --> 01:00:24.881
Because of your welfare.
You can't hand out all your stuff.

01:00:24.961 --> 01:00:29.761
That's not your thing! So, I give
someone a picture and you take it back?

01:00:29.841 --> 01:00:31.641
What are you thinking?

01:00:38.841 --> 01:00:42.161
When I return,
it'd be better if you're not here.

01:00:51.641 --> 01:00:53.601
"Jan, I love you."

01:00:54.921 --> 01:00:58.681
Jan, don't be angry.
I don't want to stalk or disturb you.

01:00:58.761 --> 01:01:02.441
You've never stayed anywhere all night.
Are you okay?

01:01:02.521 --> 01:01:05.441
I don't give a damn.
The night is beautiful!

01:01:05.521 --> 01:01:08.441
- And where are you?
- I don't know where I am.

01:01:08.521 --> 01:01:11.441
- Really, where are you?
- I don't know.

01:01:12.321 --> 01:01:15.001
In the matrix of Prague,
where I was born,

01:01:15.081 --> 01:01:18.081
where I experienced
so much evil and so much good!

01:01:18.161 --> 01:01:22.201
I'm coming for you, OK?
Just tell me where exactly you are.

01:01:22.281 --> 01:01:24.081
Where am I...

01:01:24.601 --> 01:01:27.201
There, where princess Libuse foretold.

01:01:28.401 --> 01:01:30.201
I see a great city!

01:01:32.481 --> 01:01:36.241
Incidentally, did you know
that Libuse was a man?

01:01:36.321 --> 01:01:40.081
- So where should I go?
- I'll find out. It's just here.

01:01:40.161 --> 01:01:42.561
I'm looking now. Wait a moment.

01:01:43.681 --> 01:01:47.841
It's... what is this?
By, by Foot... futil... hills.

01:01:48.281 --> 01:01:50.921
By foot... by Foothills, Liba.

01:01:51.881 --> 01:01:53.921
What? By Foothills?

01:01:54.441 --> 01:01:56.241
I don't know that.

01:01:56.441 --> 01:02:00.281
Look at the tram number.
Or, at least what the next stops are.

01:02:00.361 --> 01:02:02.881
Fragrant, Pungent.

01:02:04.201 --> 01:02:06.721
Standing, Dangling. Wait.

01:02:06.801 --> 01:02:08.601
Jan, please, for real.

01:02:10.521 --> 01:02:13.841
I'm in Nusle.
No, no, no. Liba, I'm in Liben.

01:02:26.561 --> 01:02:28.361
Jan...

01:02:30.241 --> 01:02:35.081
I've been looking all over for you.
You're soaked through. Come on.

01:02:35.161 --> 01:02:38.681
Get this car going. Let's go.
Come on, quickly home.

01:02:38.761 --> 01:02:40.561
Let's go!

01:02:40.961 --> 01:02:43.281
- You scared me.
- We're going home!

01:02:50.921 --> 01:02:53.561
TWO YEARS LATER

01:02:53.641 --> 01:02:55.441
I'm here.

01:02:57.761 --> 01:03:00.441
I have an idea.

01:03:00.641 --> 01:03:03.241
I should use an artist's name.

01:03:04.081 --> 01:03:05.881
Why?

01:03:06.241 --> 01:03:09.361
Why? To be more fine, noble.

01:03:09.441 --> 01:03:11.601
A few bucks and it's done.

01:03:11.681 --> 01:03:15.681
I'm thinking of Rachel.
That's a beautiful name, Rachel?

01:03:15.761 --> 01:03:17.561
You?

01:03:20.321 --> 01:03:23.641
You think for a few bucks
you'll be someone else?

01:03:25.321 --> 01:03:28.961
- What?
- An artist's name? What do you know?

01:03:30.001 --> 01:03:32.481
What do you have against it?

01:03:32.561 --> 01:03:35.561
You're butchering such a beautiful name!

01:03:35.641 --> 01:03:37.441
You know what?

01:03:37.761 --> 01:03:42.561
Show me how you're constipated.
Push it! Show me how you're constipated.

01:03:42.641 --> 01:03:45.681
How I can show you I'm constipated?

01:03:46.441 --> 01:03:48.241
Push it!

01:03:48.921 --> 01:03:53.881
Show me how you push when
you're constipated. I need to shoot this.

01:03:53.961 --> 01:03:58.361
Jeez, stand up and show me
how you're constipated. Squat down.

01:03:58.441 --> 01:04:00.241
Squat down and push.

01:04:00.881 --> 01:04:02.681
Jeez, push! Push!

01:04:03.801 --> 01:04:06.921
You see, it... I give you a... Come here.

01:04:07.001 --> 01:04:09.721
Sit here and push! Do it!

01:04:12.441 --> 01:04:14.641
Great. Truly nice.

01:04:15.001 --> 01:04:16.801
You know diddly-squat.

01:04:20.721 --> 01:04:22.521
Rachel.

01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:27.001
- You know what I need?
- What?

01:04:27.081 --> 01:04:29.681
More than your artist's name?

01:04:29.761 --> 01:04:33.121
I need that you finally...

01:04:34.161 --> 01:04:35.961
...lick Katka's butt.

01:04:37.361 --> 01:04:39.161
What?

01:04:40.401 --> 01:04:42.201
Jan, leave it.

01:04:43.681 --> 01:04:46.561
- I like you.
- You spoil everything!

01:04:48.161 --> 01:04:49.961
Like... like...

01:04:51.041 --> 01:04:53.721
I need passion that can crush a rock!

01:04:54.681 --> 01:04:57.681
Everyone's full of shit about morality.

01:04:57.761 --> 01:05:00.801
Everyone's so virtuous!
Fucking hypocrites,

01:05:00.881 --> 01:05:05.761
with heads full of perverse images,
and they are offended by me!

01:05:07.281 --> 01:05:09.161
Liba.

01:05:09.561 --> 01:05:13.521
Liba. I badly need you to call your mom.

01:05:15.161 --> 01:05:17.481
I need your mom to come here.

01:05:18.921 --> 01:05:20.681
Why? I don't understand.

01:05:20.761 --> 01:05:23.761
I need her to get me past this loneliness.

01:05:25.481 --> 01:05:28.161
Can you arrange for your mom to come?

01:05:39.321 --> 01:05:41.801
- Hi.
- Ciao. What are you doing here?

01:05:41.881 --> 01:05:46.721
I was passing by. It's nice here.
Really, beautiful things.

01:05:46.801 --> 01:05:52.081
- Why'd you come?
- I want to talk to you about something.

01:05:52.161 --> 01:05:56.041
- It's sometimes difficult with Jan.
- You're not serious.

01:05:56.121 --> 01:05:59.281
Now you're going to cry here
and I should comfort you?

01:05:59.361 --> 01:06:01.801
We can be friends, since we're family.

01:06:01.881 --> 01:06:07.201
- We're family?
- Almost family. Don't be so narrow-minded.

01:06:08.441 --> 01:06:11.841
You could tell me
something about Jan, couldn't you?

01:06:11.921 --> 01:06:15.921
You want me to tell you
something about him? Like what?

01:06:16.001 --> 01:06:19.721
I don't know. What matters to him, or...

01:06:20.081 --> 01:06:25.081
You've known that from the start.
Don't complain. I have work to do.

01:06:27.601 --> 01:06:29.401
Yeah.

01:06:37.721 --> 01:06:39.521
- Hi, Jan.
- Hi, Milan.

01:06:40.361 --> 01:06:42.761
This is Liba, my assistant.

01:06:42.841 --> 01:06:45.641
Liba... pretty. Do we know each other?

01:06:45.721 --> 01:06:50.321
I think you've confused me with another.
At the moment, I'm totally unknown.

01:06:50.401 --> 01:06:55.241
- I'm going to get a drink. Want one?
- Sure, grab me something.

01:06:55.321 --> 01:06:58.241
Man, I think I know
where I know her from.

01:06:58.321 --> 01:07:01.001
She wanted to be my assistant.

01:07:01.081 --> 01:07:04.361
I then sent her to Jirka David
because I didn't need one.

01:07:04.441 --> 01:07:06.241
Clearly.

01:07:12.801 --> 01:07:14.601
Excuse me.

01:07:15.841 --> 01:07:17.641
Klarka?

01:07:17.841 --> 01:07:19.841
Don't scream, please.

01:07:19.921 --> 01:07:24.641
I don't understand
when you're screaming. What's going on?

01:07:24.721 --> 01:07:27.841
Wait there for me. I'm coming for you.

01:07:42.481 --> 01:07:44.281
Klarka.

01:07:45.001 --> 01:07:47.561
Klarka, are you okay? What's with you?

01:07:49.001 --> 01:07:50.801
- Klarka.
- I feel bad!

01:07:53.041 --> 01:07:54.841
What are you doing here?

01:07:56.961 --> 01:08:00.201
- What are you doing here?
- Klarka. Calm down!

01:08:00.281 --> 01:08:05.121
- Why did you bring her here?
- Calm down. What'd you do here?

01:08:07.841 --> 01:08:12.201
- You... you took the radiators off.
Where are they? -Sold it.

01:08:12.281 --> 01:08:15.721
Don't eat that.
Don't eat off the ground.

01:08:15.801 --> 01:08:18.881
- Where did everything go?
- I sold it.

01:08:20.801 --> 01:08:23.801
I don't know, I sold everything.

01:08:24.761 --> 01:08:27.841
I got shit for it.
It was awful trash, what you gave me.

01:08:27.921 --> 01:08:32.281
Klarka... where are
all the photographs I left here?

01:08:32.361 --> 01:08:34.881
That's another thing. Those were good.

01:08:34.961 --> 01:08:40.560
I gave them to my lover
and he bought a motorcycle with them.

01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:42.441
Klarka.

01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:46.161
Klarka, you need money?
Why'd you do all this?

01:08:46.241 --> 01:08:49.600
You had to say that you don't have money.
I'd give it to you.

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:52.841
Calm down, please. Are you working?

01:08:53.841 --> 01:08:55.961
Don't talk to me like a preacher.

01:08:56.041 --> 01:08:59.680
You look after everyone,
but you don't give a damn about me.

01:08:59.761 --> 01:09:05.161
Without you, my life would be different!
I could've studied, had a normal guy.

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:11.001
- Are you going to work?
- I could've had a normal guy!

01:09:11.241 --> 01:09:15.361
Straighten out. Otherwise,
I'm putting you in rehab. Let's go, Liba.

01:09:15.441 --> 01:09:17.441
You're gonna send me to rehab?

01:09:18.441 --> 01:09:20.241
I'll send you to rehab!

01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:26.680
- You stopped caring for me!
- Klarka.

01:09:26.761 --> 01:09:31.520
I was good for you
until that one appeared! That cow!

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:35.081
You came,
and you're a maid, a maid, see?

01:09:35.161 --> 01:09:36.961
I was a personality.

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:41.640
You're a sponger,
you're a sponger, a sponger...

01:09:42.881 --> 01:09:46.761
Come on, Jan. This is pointless.
You can help her best by leaving,

01:09:46.841 --> 01:09:50.921
so she can pull herself together
on her own. No more talk.

01:09:51.001 --> 01:09:53.321
She has to go to rehab.

01:10:06.761 --> 01:10:09.401
You shouldn't have hit her,
I shouldn't have let you.

01:10:09.481 --> 01:10:14.241
Excuse me, but it was one slap to sober
her up. That doesn't hurt anyone.

01:10:14.321 --> 01:10:19.241
- What does she want from you? Did you
promise her something? -What's it to you?

01:10:19.321 --> 01:10:21.121
I like her.

01:10:22.001 --> 01:10:24.921
- You know what? Stop the car.
- Don't make a scene.

01:10:25.001 --> 01:10:27.681
Did you hear? Stop.

01:10:33.641 --> 01:10:38.401
- I'd like to know all those you bypassed
before me. -What are you talking about?

01:10:42.841 --> 01:10:44.641
Little girl...

01:10:48.121 --> 01:10:50.441
You always will be my little girl.

01:10:55.601 --> 01:10:58.961
Come, I'll snuggle you to bed.
Come, sweetie.

01:11:08.601 --> 01:11:12.121
Okay, now we'll enact
a situation where a client comes

01:11:12.201 --> 01:11:15.441
and wants you to do
Angry Mommy for him, yeah?

01:11:15.521 --> 01:11:18.161
- Now, yeah?
- Yeah, now.

01:11:18.521 --> 01:11:21.401
- Where were you, you bad, little boy?
- Where were you, you bad, little boy?

01:11:21.481 --> 01:11:24.801
- Look, the dirt under your nails.
- What's that dirt under your nails?

01:11:24.881 --> 01:11:27.721
Hit me. You naughty boy.

01:11:27.801 --> 01:11:30.241
Like that and like that.

01:11:30.321 --> 01:11:32.041
It was beautiful.

01:11:32.121 --> 01:11:34.841
Did you wash your dick? Show it to me!

01:11:34.921 --> 01:11:37.841
I won't wash it for you forever.
You're a big boy now!

01:11:37.921 --> 01:11:40.601
No one will want to be friends with you.

01:11:40.681 --> 01:11:43.201
Thoroughly! Or you'll be alone, alone!

01:11:43.281 --> 01:11:47.601
I won't wash you forever, yeah?
But don't laugh.

01:11:47.681 --> 01:11:50.961
- Wait!
- That's it! Like that.

01:11:52.321 --> 01:11:55.521
By God, you're a professional.

01:11:55.881 --> 01:11:59.961
- Someone's ringing.
- Someone's ringing. Excuse me.

01:12:00.041 --> 01:12:01.841
I'll go answer it.

01:12:04.721 --> 01:12:09.241
- Can't say I'm missing that Bohuna.
- Finally. Your timing is exquisite.

01:12:09.321 --> 01:12:12.481
We're already shooting.
What have you got on?

01:12:12.561 --> 01:12:15.801
Pants so tight
they must press on every organ.

01:12:15.881 --> 01:12:17.721
I feel just fine in them.

01:12:17.801 --> 01:12:22.561
Clearly we have to remove them.
A woman should wear a skirt!

01:12:22.641 --> 01:12:25.401
And this over your head,
if you would bug me.

01:12:25.481 --> 01:12:29.001
Or if I won't want to look at you.
I'll lift it up.

01:12:29.081 --> 01:12:34.041
- Jesus, that's such a beautiful smell.
- No. I have to have a wash!

01:12:34.601 --> 01:12:37.561
You didn't tell me Bohuna was coming.
I'm leaving.

01:12:37.641 --> 01:12:41.761
- What's happened?
- She stole my man. My private man!

01:12:41.921 --> 01:12:45.001
You're a stupid, swollen tit.

01:12:45.081 --> 01:12:49.721
- Hooter! Tit!
- How dare you? You're whore!

01:12:49.801 --> 01:12:55.081
- You're a whore! You're a regular whore!
- Stop it, girls. You're both right!

01:12:55.161 --> 01:12:59.201
- I need to shoot. Stop it!
- Are you thinking with your tits?

01:12:59.281 --> 01:13:01.081
Girls...

01:13:01.361 --> 01:13:05.041
Ladies, I urge you to keep cool!

01:13:17.521 --> 01:13:23.081
Good morning. I knew you'd miss me!
I'm fixing breakfast. Want some?

01:13:23.161 --> 01:13:26.121
Is that you? Where's your mother?

01:13:26.201 --> 01:13:29.401
The morning bird still isn't awake?

01:13:29.481 --> 01:13:31.281
- I'm Liba, hi.
- Hi.

01:13:33.281 --> 01:13:39.521
It's a pigsty here. I'm opening a window,
okay? The stench is awful.

01:13:39.601 --> 01:13:42.601
Don't be mad, Jan. I have to talk shop.

01:13:43.641 --> 01:13:47.881
I have to run to the tax-man. You've
got a trouble with an unpaid penalty.

01:13:47.961 --> 01:13:50.921
Alice didn't say anything.
Good that you fired her.

01:13:51.001 --> 01:13:56.401
Then I'm running to an appointment
with gallery manager. Sign it here.

01:13:57.201 --> 01:14:01.481
- It's for the installation. Are you okay?
- Probably just a heart attack.

01:14:01.561 --> 01:14:04.601
Come on. Sign it, Jan, please.

01:14:04.681 --> 01:14:08.481
I'm really in a hurry here.
You approve the installation.

01:14:08.561 --> 01:14:12.441
Here are the photographs sold to France,
the delivery protocol.

01:14:12.521 --> 01:14:16.401
And the contract. It's fine.
I checked it with the lawyer.

01:14:16.481 --> 01:14:18.761
Sign this copy, too.

01:14:20.081 --> 01:14:25.001
At 1pm we'll go by the notary for the
power-of-attorney for buying the house.

01:14:25.081 --> 01:14:30.321
And tonight there's that charity concert.
That shirt stinks. Is it yours? No.

01:14:30.401 --> 01:14:33.481
- Want something for breakfast?
- I'm cold.

01:14:33.561 --> 01:14:37.041
I'll make you tea.
So... that's also mine.

01:14:50.081 --> 01:14:51.881
Anicka.

01:14:53.641 --> 01:14:55.441
What is it?

01:14:55.761 --> 01:14:57.801
What happened, Anicka?

01:14:57.881 --> 01:15:01.161
Anicka, why are you crying? What?

01:15:01.241 --> 01:15:03.041
What... mom?

01:15:13.481 --> 01:15:15.281
Anicka.

01:15:15.761 --> 01:15:19.001
We came to the hospital
and I saw only the empty bed there.

01:15:19.081 --> 01:15:20.881
Momma was already gone.

01:15:22.041 --> 01:15:23.841
I'm so sorry.

01:15:24.841 --> 01:15:27.121
I'm so sorry... so sorry.

01:15:29.641 --> 01:15:31.441
What can I do now?

01:15:33.041 --> 01:15:39.081
Dear friends, we are gathered here
today with our deceased.

01:15:40.001 --> 01:15:43.601
Our deceased was a strong woman.

01:15:45.001 --> 01:15:49.481
Despite this,
life was not easy for her at times.

01:15:49.561 --> 01:15:52.241
Let this earth be easy on her.

01:15:52.601 --> 01:15:56.801
Let her recline
in the tranquility of eternity.

01:16:01.001 --> 01:16:02.281
TWO YEARS LATER

01:16:02.361 --> 01:16:05.721
It's said that you're
an expert on women. Are you?

01:16:05.801 --> 01:16:07.201
No.

01:16:07.281 --> 01:16:11.441
- Only a woman can be an expert on women!
- That's true.

01:16:11.521 --> 01:16:15.481
That intangible and relentless
sum of fragility, courage and love,

01:16:15.561 --> 01:16:21.001
on the other hand, dishonesty and vicious
treachery... impossible to comprehend.

01:16:21.081 --> 01:16:24.081
Attention - they can't be
otherwise because they...

01:16:24.161 --> 01:16:28.081
- Maintaining life is on them.
- Are you an enemy of marriage?

01:16:28.161 --> 01:16:32.001
Yeah, I am. I realized too late
that I'm unsuited to marriage.

01:16:32.081 --> 01:16:38.041
That sacred bond, which is intended
only for the strong, noble ones

01:16:38.121 --> 01:16:42.681
who are willing to sacrifice all...
I've never been successful at that.

01:16:42.761 --> 01:16:48.641
Now I have a quite personal question for
you. Do you live with a significant other?

01:16:48.721 --> 01:16:53.361
After I was widowed, I told myself,
no more significant others.

01:16:53.441 --> 01:16:58.721
Tell us, what kind of woman you like.
Physically. How a beautiful woman looks.

01:16:58.801 --> 01:17:03.121
This cult of youth
and emancipation, skinniness...

01:17:03.201 --> 01:17:05.681
That's for pedophiles. It's unnatural.

01:17:05.761 --> 01:17:09.241
Those who contend that they like
scrawny women are lying.

01:17:09.321 --> 01:17:11.521
- I agree.
- It's unnatural.

01:17:11.601 --> 01:17:15.001
A mighty ass, that's the hood
for the love engine, right?

01:17:15.081 --> 01:17:17.161
Definitely, no argument, yes.

01:17:17.241 --> 01:17:21.201
- If we're open now...
- We're not open. I'm open. You're not.

01:17:21.281 --> 01:17:24.721
- Ok, you are being open.
- We'll try.

01:17:24.801 --> 01:17:28.841
I heard you've also
had relationships with men.

01:17:28.921 --> 01:17:33.881
Yeah! I once had such a beautiful period.
Taking the communion "Under both kinds."

01:17:33.961 --> 01:17:40.041
I recall Vaclav Cerny... a young actor.
It was a wonderful time, heavenly.

01:17:40.121 --> 01:17:42.801
Jan, listen to this.

01:17:44.121 --> 01:17:45.961
Popular actor, father of 3 children

01:17:46.041 --> 01:17:49.761
living happily in a harmonious
marriage for 30 years,

01:17:49.841 --> 01:17:52.881
- is suing a famous photographer.
- Don't read it.

01:17:52.961 --> 01:17:58.401
It's important. And seeks 7 millions
all of which he's donating to charity.

01:17:58.481 --> 01:18:01.881
I got carried away.
I shouldn't have said it! I regret it.

01:18:01.961 --> 01:18:07.441
I knew it would be a trouble.
His lawyer Mr. Jasny never loses a case.

01:18:07.521 --> 01:18:12.201
If proved that the plaintiff
has sustained such harm

01:18:12.281 --> 01:18:17.001
as to threaten to dissolve
his marriage, he may succeed.

01:18:17.081 --> 01:18:21.241
There is a risk they could
place lien on your property.

01:18:21.321 --> 01:18:23.721
Impossible to prevent this.

01:18:23.801 --> 01:18:28.801
Because of that crap I'll have such
problems? Is there no way to oppose it?

01:18:28.881 --> 01:18:33.321
I also didn't say that much, did I?
Besides, it's all true.

01:18:33.401 --> 01:18:35.201
That fag.

01:18:36.641 --> 01:18:42.361
Transfering to the kids, it's like to
throw the money in the river.

01:18:43.561 --> 01:18:46.001
With me, it'd be like in a safe.

01:18:46.081 --> 01:18:47.881
An impregnable one, I hope.

01:18:50.921 --> 01:18:55.601
If anyone found out,
they'd think I got mad, trusting you.

01:18:55.681 --> 01:18:59.361
And if you rob me,
I'll wring your beautiful swan's neck.

01:19:01.801 --> 01:19:03.601
There... There's Anezka.

01:19:04.761 --> 01:19:06.521
Hello.

01:19:06.601 --> 01:19:11.161
Hi Anezka. I'd like to transfer
my accounts into this lady's name.

01:19:11.241 --> 01:19:13.521
Fine, may I have your ID's?

01:19:13.601 --> 01:19:15.401
Of course.

01:19:15.841 --> 01:19:17.641
- Please.
- Thank you.

01:19:19.761 --> 01:19:23.361
- We're transferring all accounts?
- All accounts.

01:19:23.441 --> 01:19:27.881
I'll keep the signatory powers.
If the lady permits.

01:19:27.961 --> 01:19:33.401
And here's the payment receipt of
the property transfer tax.

01:19:33.481 --> 01:19:35.481
So much money for the transfer?

01:19:36.601 --> 01:19:39.201
I would be better to give it to a charity.

01:19:39.281 --> 01:19:42.961
You give enough to charity.
Come see where I'm putting it.

01:19:43.041 --> 01:19:44.481
I trust you.

01:19:44.561 --> 01:19:48.921
You'll have the promissory note
here in the safe. See that?

01:19:49.001 --> 01:19:50.801
So I'm putting it here.

01:19:51.521 --> 01:19:56.001
- You hide the key well somewhere.
- I trust you. You're the only one I trust.

01:19:56.081 --> 01:19:58.921
If you wanted to rob me,
you'd have done it long ago.

01:19:59.001 --> 01:20:03.121
You've had quite a lot of chances,
yet you saved me some money.

01:20:03.201 --> 01:20:05.001
Come to me.

01:20:08.521 --> 01:20:11.201
You know, I'm...

01:20:11.321 --> 01:20:13.881
- But I'm pretty much a coward.
- You?

01:20:13.961 --> 01:20:18.401
Oh yeah. I was always afraid.
My whole life I've been afraid.

01:20:18.481 --> 01:20:23.601
I was afraid that someone's
going to beat me up, that I would fail.

01:20:23.681 --> 01:20:28.161
That I earned cash under-the-table,
that someone would blow the whistle,

01:20:28.241 --> 01:20:31.441
and that they'd forbid me to work.
I was afraid of the KGB.

01:20:31.521 --> 01:20:33.321
Don't fuck with me!

01:20:36.601 --> 01:20:40.121
We want you to feed us
information about these people.

01:20:40.201 --> 01:20:43.761
We know they're prepping
your exhibition in America.

01:20:43.841 --> 01:20:46.921
We'll let you go there, to the U.S.A.

01:20:47.961 --> 01:20:50.481
You'll be able to legally sell your work.

01:20:50.561 --> 01:20:56.401
You'll be accepted into the artist guild
and don't have to go back to the factory.

01:20:56.481 --> 01:20:59.721
We need your service in return.
What about it?

01:20:59.801 --> 01:21:01.601
I can't. I simply can't.

01:21:02.321 --> 01:21:06.641
- I can't do it.
- Sign it and your life will change!

01:21:06.721 --> 01:21:10.601
I just can't sign it.
I'd rather hang myself!

01:21:10.681 --> 01:21:13.201
- Sign it!
- I can't sign this.

01:21:13.281 --> 01:21:18.281
- If you don't, I'll make your life hell!
- I guess I'll hang myself!

01:21:18.361 --> 01:21:22.401
Some people they wanted me to
inform on I later found on the police list

01:21:22.481 --> 01:21:27.801
among the informants. None of them
ever apologized nor blushed out of shame.

01:21:32.361 --> 01:21:36.361
Again they're carrying me there,
that old way

01:21:36.801 --> 01:21:40.841
Where I tread,
with vest all puke-stained

01:21:40.921 --> 01:21:44.481
In my grave, give me 2 kegs of beer

01:21:45.081 --> 01:21:48.681
And instead of a priest,
a whore who sings clear.

01:21:51.121 --> 01:21:55.841
Dear ones, I'll tell you
a story from recent times:

01:21:55.921 --> 01:21:59.281
when my nasty tongue got me
in the pickle I'm now in

01:21:59.361 --> 01:22:03.001
I decided to live culturally.
I enter a gallery.

01:22:03.081 --> 01:22:07.081
They are open, they are
probably reconstructing the building.

01:22:07.161 --> 01:22:10.761
Everywhere,
modern plastic pipes, wiring, sand,

01:22:11.601 --> 01:22:14.401
some beams, a toilet bowl!

01:22:15.441 --> 01:22:17.361
And then I see the catalog.

01:22:17.441 --> 01:22:20.761
And I drop to my knees:
this is the exhibit!

01:22:21.641 --> 01:22:24.481
A Post-Conceptual installation! Damn!

01:22:24.561 --> 01:22:27.641
I'm looking through the catalog
to understand.

01:22:27.721 --> 01:22:30.921
I am, after all,
a European, not a jackass!

01:22:31.001 --> 01:22:36.921
And I read: "The continuance of
artistic creation evokes the complex set

01:22:37.001 --> 01:22:40.841
of a-priori norms
of imaginative self-reflection

01:22:40.921 --> 01:22:45.601
while the institutional congeniality of
this post-modern point-of-view

01:22:45.681 --> 01:22:47.481
and vision..."

01:22:47.561 --> 01:22:51.641
My hair bristled,
my hair bristled and I read on,

01:22:53.081 --> 01:22:56.281
"...like introspection
are of the smallest quintessence

01:22:56.361 --> 01:22:59.281
in purely post-conceptual ethics."

01:23:05.001 --> 01:23:09.641
I hope that my humble booklet
will be intelligible to all.

01:23:11.121 --> 01:23:13.761
I want to introduce to you...

01:23:13.841 --> 01:23:17.001
- What's with you?
- ...the rising star.

01:23:17.081 --> 01:23:19.081
My top model and photographer,

01:23:19.161 --> 01:23:24.001
who has so many of her images
in the epilogue of this book. Liba!

01:23:24.081 --> 01:23:26.161
Liba, join us!

01:23:26.441 --> 01:23:28.761
- Join us! Don't be shy.
- Hello.

01:23:33.401 --> 01:23:37.601
I'd like to ask you to
introduce their book to the world.

01:23:38.761 --> 01:23:44.121
We wish only the best and that it be
more successful than the previous book.

01:23:44.201 --> 01:23:46.001
Best of luck.

01:23:46.121 --> 01:23:48.801
- May it do well.
- May it be liked.

01:23:49.961 --> 01:23:55.761
I'd like to also... May I say something?
I'm obviously not a schooled photographer.

01:23:55.841 --> 01:23:58.521
When a person has
capacity for communication,

01:23:58.601 --> 01:24:03.401
when he knows what he wants to talk about,
I think it's easy for them to do it.

01:24:06.401 --> 01:24:08.201
Boring. Disgrace. Scandal.

01:24:08.681 --> 01:24:10.681
- Sorry but don't do it!
- What?

01:24:10.761 --> 01:24:16.121
You can't afford to let someone forge
your photographs and still support them.

01:24:16.201 --> 01:24:19.241
It devalues your work! Understand?

01:24:19.321 --> 01:24:25.281
If you'd help someone talented, that'd
be great but you're supporting copying.

01:24:25.361 --> 01:24:29.601
You're throwing the original
and the imitation into one bag.

01:24:29.681 --> 01:24:32.801
Sorry, but I have to leave,
running to work.

01:24:32.881 --> 01:24:35.321
We'll call, write, okay? Bye-bye.

01:24:38.081 --> 01:24:41.641
- Jan, excuse me. May I interrupt you?
- Yes.

01:24:41.721 --> 01:24:46.321
You accused me of forgetting to
pay the penalty at the tax office.

01:24:46.401 --> 01:24:49.281
You never had any penalty.

01:24:49.361 --> 01:24:52.801
- Are you serious?
- You fired me without any emotions.

01:24:52.881 --> 01:24:57.281
- You were unfair and cruel!
- But you liked it. No?

01:24:57.361 --> 01:24:59.161
Jan... I beg you pardon?

01:25:02.321 --> 01:25:06.201
Hello. I'm Seidlova.
I'm from Mlada Fronta Magazine.

01:25:06.281 --> 01:25:10.921
Your assistant has been promising me
we'll arrange an interview, and nothing.

01:25:11.001 --> 01:25:15.201
Time's running out for it.
I've blocked 6 whole pages.

01:25:15.281 --> 01:25:18.561
You've got to hold your horses. Watch out!

01:25:25.121 --> 01:25:27.321
Call an ambulance! Klarka?

01:25:28.441 --> 01:25:31.201
- Jan, come here!
- Klarka...

01:25:31.281 --> 01:25:33.081
Klarka!

01:25:33.801 --> 01:25:37.361
- Klarka! What happened?
- She fell down the stairs.

01:25:38.761 --> 01:25:40.561
Excuse me.

01:25:42.241 --> 01:25:44.361
That's Jan's cousin Klarka.

01:25:44.441 --> 01:25:47.721
She's not his cousin! She's his daughter!

01:25:47.801 --> 01:25:51.321
Sorry, you must be confused.
That's not Jan's daughter.

01:25:51.401 --> 01:25:57.241
Confused? No way! I knew her mother. And
the little girl Klarka since her birth.

01:26:09.841 --> 01:26:11.881
She has a bad concussion.

01:26:11.961 --> 01:26:16.281
- How'd they give you that information?
- They told me. And what?

01:26:16.361 --> 01:26:20.161
Why'd they tell you?
Because you're her father?

01:26:20.241 --> 01:26:23.641
What is this bullshit?
I'm not her father.

01:26:23.721 --> 01:26:27.201
I've heard these rumors.
And you believe them?

01:26:27.281 --> 01:26:30.361
- And?
- What "And"? What "And"?

01:26:31.681 --> 01:26:36.281
What is this interrogation? Jana would
have told me that she is my daughter.

01:26:36.361 --> 01:26:40.201
- So take a paternity test.
- You see how pushy you're?

01:26:40.281 --> 01:26:43.081
I've had it with you. Get outta here!

01:26:43.161 --> 01:26:44.961
Get outta here! Now!

01:26:45.041 --> 01:26:47.561
Yuck! Get out of here!

01:26:54.401 --> 01:26:58.001
You're a beautiful.
You've nothing to be ashamed of.

01:26:58.081 --> 01:27:02.121
Like this we'll do it.
I'll take this brooch away.

01:27:03.881 --> 01:27:05.681
So we don't get pricked.

01:27:06.881 --> 01:27:11.001
A little like this, the strap aside
as well, and your hand down.

01:27:16.081 --> 01:27:17.961
Don't be afraid.

01:27:18.361 --> 01:27:21.361
Breathe. Try breathing deeply.

01:27:23.081 --> 01:27:25.921
You see, you're still beautiful.

01:27:26.801 --> 01:27:28.601
Show me...

01:27:28.841 --> 01:27:32.161
- No. Not that.
- Yes. Come on. The little knee.

01:27:34.161 --> 01:27:37.281
And now we'll open them a bit.

01:27:43.641 --> 01:27:45.961
- Grab me there.
- No.

01:27:47.361 --> 01:27:49.681
- Put a hand there for me.
- No.

01:27:51.281 --> 01:27:53.081
- Yes. Yes.
- No.

01:27:54.081 --> 01:27:56.761
Grab me by the balls.

01:27:58.201 --> 01:28:00.001
Don't be afraid.

01:28:01.841 --> 01:28:06.841
You're full of desire, of love,
only you don't have any one to give it to.

01:28:29.841 --> 01:28:31.641
Mom, Jan, are you home?

01:28:33.521 --> 01:28:35.881
- Hi, mom.
- Hi, Liba!

01:28:36.961 --> 01:28:38.761
Are we going now?

01:28:39.641 --> 01:28:43.601
Are you taking us to the train station?
Where's dad?

01:28:43.681 --> 01:28:46.361
I'll take you to the train station. Come.

01:28:49.441 --> 01:28:52.761
Lawyer Jasny and your ex...

01:28:53.361 --> 01:28:58.401
- ...lover. Say it. I'm not ashamed of it.
- Lover are willing to withdraw the suit.

01:28:58.481 --> 01:29:03.161
They would be satisfied
with an apology in the press. Agree?

01:29:03.241 --> 01:29:05.681
An apology is enough?

01:29:05.761 --> 01:29:08.881
How'd you manage it?
You're incredible.

01:29:08.961 --> 01:29:10.801
I will gladly apologize.

01:29:11.881 --> 01:29:14.841
That's the reporter about your interview.

01:29:14.921 --> 01:29:19.201
Okay, tell her that I'll do it.
I'll do it today even.

01:29:20.401 --> 01:29:23.601
- So get going. I'll arrange it.
- Fine.

01:29:23.681 --> 01:29:26.721
You know what?
Have her come by in 2 hours.

01:29:26.881 --> 01:29:28.681
Fine.

01:29:30.641 --> 01:29:33.441
You have to turn it in tomorrow?

01:29:33.521 --> 01:29:36.521
But unfortunately he can't today.

01:29:37.121 --> 01:29:40.001
Don't cancel it. I have an idea.

01:29:40.081 --> 01:29:44.321
How about an interview with me?
I know no one knows me,

01:29:44.401 --> 01:29:48.881
but I can tell you
a lot of curiosities about Jan.

01:29:51.281 --> 01:29:53.841
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure is mine.

01:29:53.921 --> 01:29:58.241
We don't have much time,
so let's get into it, yeah?

01:29:58.321 --> 01:30:01.681
Liba, how long have you
actually lived with Jan?

01:30:01.761 --> 01:30:03.561
Almost 5 years.

01:30:04.081 --> 01:30:08.361
- Was it a tough 5 years? -No, it was
the most beautiful years of my life!

01:30:08.441 --> 01:30:13.721
- You're not jealous?
- May I take your order? -Still water.

01:30:13.801 --> 01:30:17.361
- Aren't you jealous?
- No, why?

01:30:17.601 --> 01:30:20.921
Jan tells me the truth.
A person has to respect that,

01:30:21.001 --> 01:30:24.241
especially these days
when people lie so much.

01:30:24.321 --> 01:30:26.121
Look at my photographs.

01:30:28.161 --> 01:30:30.161
What do you think about them?

01:30:31.561 --> 01:30:33.561
Could you print them for me?

01:30:34.561 --> 01:30:36.361
Do you like them?

01:30:37.441 --> 01:30:39.481
They're candid, aren't they?

01:30:40.841 --> 01:30:45.081
I can't stop looking at you.
You're an utterly interesting type.

01:30:45.161 --> 01:30:48.081
Wouldn't you want me to photograph you?

01:30:59.841 --> 01:31:04.761
Dad, next time be careful
and think first before saying something.

01:31:04.841 --> 01:31:09.201
So we don't have to declare you
insane for your own good.

01:31:09.281 --> 01:31:12.921
- Thank you.
- Marek's right. Let's leave it at that.

01:31:13.001 --> 01:31:16.401
- To your health and no court.
- To your health.

01:31:24.241 --> 01:31:30.961
"In shitting yes'day I did know
The sess I to my arse did owe:

01:31:32.241 --> 01:31:37.321
The smell was such came from that slunk,
That I was with it all bestunk:

01:31:37.401 --> 01:31:41.361
O had but then some brave Signor brought
her to me I waited for in shitting!

01:31:42.481 --> 01:31:47.561
I would have cleft her watergap,
And join'd it close to my flipflap,

01:31:47.641 --> 01:31:51.961
Whilst she had with her fingers guarded
My foul nockandrow, all in shit."

01:31:54.601 --> 01:31:57.441
You're going to talk anal all night?

01:31:57.961 --> 01:32:01.401
You read too little.
That's a Renaissance: Rabelais.

01:32:01.481 --> 01:32:04.601
You should read more.
And need some tutoring.

01:32:04.681 --> 01:32:07.961
Come by for some books.
You'll learn something new.

01:32:08.041 --> 01:32:09.801
Okay.

01:32:12.201 --> 01:32:17.081
- Marek, what's the matter?
- Nothing. I can't stand his horseshit!

01:32:17.161 --> 01:32:20.481
I don't mean Jan.
What happened with you and Eva?

01:32:22.001 --> 01:32:24.281
We're getting a divorce.

01:32:24.361 --> 01:32:26.161
Do you regret it?

01:32:26.521 --> 01:32:28.321
It sucks.

01:32:46.681 --> 01:32:49.961
Hi dad. Buy Mlada Fronta. It's there.

01:32:50.921 --> 01:32:55.601
Front page, then the whole interview
inside. Beautiful. I'm happy.

01:32:55.681 --> 01:33:00.321
Please buy another 10 at home,
so we have it, yeah?

01:33:01.201 --> 01:33:02.921
You probably don't know,

01:33:03.001 --> 01:33:07.481
but you've made yourself
a completely different person for me.

01:33:07.561 --> 01:33:09.441
I want to have your children!

01:33:09.521 --> 01:33:13.481
You don't have to be afraid.
I don't want you to sacrifice.

01:33:13.561 --> 01:33:15.761
I don't even want your love.

01:33:15.841 --> 01:33:20.361
I want your genes.
I want talented children, Jan!

01:33:20.441 --> 01:33:24.201
I don't want to bring into
this world kids who'll have a bad dad.

01:33:24.281 --> 01:33:27.521
Enlist someone else for this, okay?

01:33:27.601 --> 01:33:31.081
Your kids don't deserve to
have an irresponsible dad.

01:33:35.361 --> 01:33:41.041
- It looks really good.
- The building's in a preserved state.

01:33:41.121 --> 01:33:42.921
It has original fixtures.

01:33:43.721 --> 01:33:48.161
- Liba? The kitchen's also okay, isn't it?
- I like it. -Me too.

01:33:48.241 --> 01:33:50.041
What's this?

01:33:51.161 --> 01:33:57.801
This is a nice room, Liba.
When you sin, you'll repent up here.

01:33:57.881 --> 01:34:00.201
I would get it. I like it.

01:34:01.841 --> 01:34:04.441
Liba will sort out
the formalities with you.

01:34:04.521 --> 01:34:09.001
- I bid you farewell. Have a good day.
- I'll call, yes?

01:34:10.641 --> 01:34:13.441
It's great, I'd like to
bring my friend here,

01:34:13.521 --> 01:34:16.841
he is a building engineer,
to look it over.

01:34:16.921 --> 01:34:19.801
- Okay.
- I'll try to bring the price down more.

01:34:19.881 --> 01:34:21.241
That'd be good.

01:34:21.321 --> 01:34:25.481
Don't worry about thing,
I'll need your power-of-attorney.

01:34:29.561 --> 01:34:32.921
Jesus. Take it like that and hack!

01:34:33.001 --> 01:34:35.041
Now! Really tastefully.

01:34:35.121 --> 01:34:36.921
Now do it this way.

01:34:48.881 --> 01:34:50.681
One moment.

01:34:50.881 --> 01:34:54.961
Hold it. Smile, for real.
Everyone show their teeth.

01:34:55.041 --> 01:34:57.041
That's it.

01:34:59.361 --> 01:35:01.161
Beautiful.

01:35:02.881 --> 01:35:07.201
- I'm afraid.
- Come on, sweetie. Give me your hand.

01:35:08.001 --> 01:35:09.801
Watch out.

01:35:14.681 --> 01:35:16.481
Come on.

01:35:20.041 --> 01:35:23.841
Please come with me.
The doctor will be here shortly.

01:35:23.921 --> 01:35:25.601
I don't want to go there.

01:35:25.681 --> 01:35:30.001
- Here, sit.
- You said you needed something important.

01:35:30.321 --> 01:35:33.601
You want to photograph me?
I wouldn't have come.

01:35:33.681 --> 01:35:36.201
That's it... show me.

01:35:39.281 --> 01:35:42.241
- You have gorgeous eyes, you know?
- Yeah.

01:35:42.321 --> 01:35:45.081
There's a mysterious gleam in them.

01:35:45.161 --> 01:35:46.961
But repressed.

01:35:47.921 --> 01:35:49.721
Something's missing.

01:35:51.961 --> 01:35:55.321
It's as if Eva has you... excuse me.

01:35:55.401 --> 01:36:01.121
As if she has you pinned to the ground.
You're so completely uptight and hung-up.

01:36:01.201 --> 01:36:03.001
Unwind.

01:36:03.401 --> 01:36:07.241
You need to take off, spread your wings.

01:36:10.201 --> 01:36:11.761
Look at me.

01:36:11.841 --> 01:36:14.561
Why the show here, Liba?

01:36:16.321 --> 01:36:18.201
How was Jan as a dad?

01:36:18.281 --> 01:36:21.761
He tried, but somehow
it never worked for him.

01:36:21.841 --> 01:36:23.641
I don't know.

01:36:23.721 --> 01:36:25.521
Mom suffered.

01:36:26.681 --> 01:36:28.921
I guess she passed it on to us...

01:36:29.001 --> 01:36:34.761
That's a mistake. I'd never deprive
kids of their dad just over infidelity.

01:36:34.841 --> 01:36:37.921
- Take it off.
- I gotta go now.

01:36:38.001 --> 01:36:39.801
- Why?
- I gotta go.

01:36:39.961 --> 01:36:43.401
Some other time... gleam, wings, flame.

01:36:44.041 --> 01:36:46.321
We'll party one night.

01:36:46.401 --> 01:36:48.201
'Til next time.

01:36:56.721 --> 01:36:59.601
Bye-bye. Watch out for yourself.

01:36:59.681 --> 01:37:01.481
Don't leave me here.

01:37:03.801 --> 01:37:08.281
I'll visit you. You'll pull
yourself together here. You'll make it.

01:37:09.881 --> 01:37:11.681
I'm afraid.

01:37:13.881 --> 01:37:16.721
You'll be happy here. Believe me.

01:37:16.801 --> 01:37:20.841
You'll find friends here. You won't be
alone. You'll help each other.

01:37:20.921 --> 01:37:23.601
Wendy, you're very kind. We thank you.

01:37:45.281 --> 01:37:48.281
This one came out well. I like it. Look.

01:37:49.001 --> 01:37:54.001
- Do you like them?
- I'm not into admiring myself that much.

01:38:04.841 --> 01:38:06.641
Do you need something?

01:38:10.401 --> 01:38:14.081
I want to get to know you
a little more, Marek.

01:38:18.641 --> 01:38:21.161
What are you up to, Liba?

01:38:26.001 --> 01:38:27.801
You wanna have sex?

01:38:28.121 --> 01:38:29.921
Why just sex?

01:38:32.681 --> 01:38:37.321
- I'm not interested in my father's lovers.
- I'm not Jan's lover anymore.

01:38:37.401 --> 01:38:39.201
Or his lovelorn "ex" s!

01:38:40.361 --> 01:38:45.641
- Jan and I are still partners, but we
don't unite in sex. -Well, there you go.

01:38:45.721 --> 01:38:47.921
And I'm not interested.

01:38:48.001 --> 01:38:51.961
Maybe it would've been better
if you'd been with me.

01:38:52.041 --> 01:38:53.841
And why?

01:38:54.721 --> 01:38:56.521
You'll see.

01:39:00.161 --> 01:39:01.961
Do whatever you want.

01:39:18.681 --> 01:39:21.401
- What is it?
- I have a surprise for you.

01:39:21.481 --> 01:39:25.401
- What kind of surprise, dear God?
- Now! Please...

01:39:27.201 --> 01:39:31.401
I want you driven up
to the scene like a true king!

01:39:31.481 --> 01:39:33.281
It's a beautiful car.

01:39:33.681 --> 01:39:35.481
So, please.

01:39:35.561 --> 01:39:39.961
- What? Me first?
- Please. -Thank you. Hello.

01:39:40.121 --> 01:39:41.921
Wow, it's beautiful.

01:39:43.721 --> 01:39:45.521
It's beautiful.

01:39:46.761 --> 01:39:49.201
- What's this?
- Everything's organized.

01:39:49.281 --> 01:39:53.241
You're going with us. And you guys
go straight to the gallery.

01:39:53.321 --> 01:39:55.761
Liba, you shouldn't have done this.

01:40:10.001 --> 01:40:14.081
Liba, I like attention,
but only when it concerns work.

01:40:14.161 --> 01:40:17.681
You know what?
We'll see each other there.

01:40:38.881 --> 01:40:40.681
Hello.

01:40:44.201 --> 01:40:46.481
Hello. Thank you.

01:41:35.161 --> 01:41:37.281
Dear guests, friends...

01:41:40.721 --> 01:41:43.641
I welcome you to Jan's and my exhibition.

01:41:43.721 --> 01:41:48.961
The greatest to be held
in this venerable hall in 10 years!

01:41:49.401 --> 01:41:53.441
You can find my photographs
in the adjoining hall.

01:41:53.521 --> 01:41:55.681
So, where is my discoverer?

01:41:58.001 --> 01:41:59.801
Jan!

01:42:08.201 --> 01:42:10.641
Hello all. Friends.

01:42:11.281 --> 01:42:17.481
People often say to me:
Jan, show us how you truly are. Open up.

01:42:18.361 --> 01:42:23.361
Truth is, I'm really a walking quandary,
but one thing I know for sure:

01:42:23.441 --> 01:42:26.921
that it's impossible to
ignore things that've happened.

01:42:27.001 --> 01:42:30.481
Because history gets in our genes.

01:42:32.041 --> 01:42:34.361
So, God be with you.

01:42:35.001 --> 01:42:36.801
Have a good time.

01:42:38.481 --> 01:42:40.281
Have a good time.

01:42:40.921 --> 01:42:42.721
Yeah, enjoy yourselves!

01:42:47.521 --> 01:42:49.721
That was very sincere, Jan!

01:42:50.441 --> 01:42:52.241
Very!

01:42:52.681 --> 01:42:55.401
- I also must rebuke you!
- What have I done?

01:42:55.481 --> 01:42:59.041
Who have you created?
You're giving her a big hand up.

01:42:59.121 --> 01:43:01.521
You're talking about me, ma'am?

01:43:01.601 --> 01:43:02.961
Yes.

01:43:03.041 --> 01:43:06.081
When one tries a new thing,
the other likes to kick him.

01:43:06.161 --> 01:43:10.241
The lady would only smear
her shoes if she kicked you.

01:43:10.321 --> 01:43:12.641
Ladies, I urge you to keep cool...!

01:43:12.721 --> 01:43:14.521
Wendy!

01:43:15.361 --> 01:43:18.881
I'm glad you came.
You're looking mighty good.

01:43:18.961 --> 01:43:21.881
- Can I take a picture here?
- Of course. Shoot it.

01:43:21.961 --> 01:43:25.121
- Can we meet tomorrow?
- You'll teach me photography?

01:43:25.201 --> 01:43:26.641
It would be my pleasure.

01:43:26.721 --> 01:43:28.881
- Nice to meet you.
- Me too.

01:43:28.961 --> 01:43:32.361
With the director,
we're about to publish a calendar

01:43:32.441 --> 01:43:36.401
for which famous actresses
will be photographed semi-nude.

01:43:36.481 --> 01:43:41.521
- The proceeds would go to charity, right?
- We wanted to ask the Maestro,

01:43:41.601 --> 01:43:45.161
but probably he would've been
too expensive for us.

01:43:45.241 --> 01:43:48.721
Then it came to us
that you might want to shoot it?

01:43:48.801 --> 01:43:54.321
- Seriously? This is incredible!
- We'd like to have it by his famous wall.

01:43:54.401 --> 01:43:59.321
We want something similar to
what Jan does. But cheaper.

01:43:59.401 --> 01:44:01.201
Most happily!

01:44:01.681 --> 01:44:07.161
That picture, I like that one, so I say
let's shoot something like this with you.

01:44:07.241 --> 01:44:09.121
Come on.

01:44:12.561 --> 01:44:17.281
You haven't been caressed enough...
you need to be fondled.

01:44:20.001 --> 01:44:23.121
Not there.
Somewhere else... somewhere else.

01:44:26.001 --> 01:44:28.921
- Sleep.
- Fondle me elsewhere.

01:44:32.641 --> 01:44:37.001
Hello, Anezka. My card is acting up.
I'd like to withdraw some cash.

01:44:37.081 --> 01:44:42.041
And then, could you transfer
some money from this account to mine.

01:44:45.481 --> 01:44:47.481
But this account is closed.

01:44:48.481 --> 01:44:51.121
- How closed?
- By the owner of the account.

01:44:51.201 --> 01:44:55.761
The money was transferred elsewhere
and the account was closed.

01:44:55.841 --> 01:44:59.241
When did this happen?
When was it shut down?

01:44:59.321 --> 01:45:04.521
A few days ago. Unfortunately, though,
I can't give you any further information.

01:45:04.601 --> 01:45:07.041
What this means? Why did you do it?

01:45:07.121 --> 01:45:10.361
- There wasn't any money.
So I shut it down. -How come?

01:45:10.441 --> 01:45:13.961
The purchase and renovation
of the house cost millions!

01:45:14.041 --> 01:45:17.761
I'm all but a scrooge!
You know that money's not all for me!

01:45:17.841 --> 01:45:22.961
You've got a salary like the president!
But such theft... such wicked theft!

01:45:23.041 --> 01:45:26.721
I haven't stolen anything!
I pay all expenses from it!

01:45:26.801 --> 01:45:28.601
Jeez.

01:45:29.521 --> 01:45:32.961
Why'd you close out the account?
Tell me, why?

01:45:33.041 --> 01:45:36.041
Even though if there wasn't any,
you closed it!

01:45:36.121 --> 01:45:39.161
How about my fees?
What account they are going to?

01:45:39.241 --> 01:45:43.641
I'm really sorry.
We'll open one now. I didn't manage it.

01:45:43.721 --> 01:45:47.441
You're always with that Wendy!
She takes up all your time!

01:45:47.521 --> 01:45:51.521
What do you get from her?
You say what an inspiration I am.

01:45:51.601 --> 01:45:56.401
- She just demotivates you!
- Where'd the promissory note disappear to?

01:45:56.481 --> 01:45:59.441
A mysterious robbery?
A strange disappearance!

01:45:59.521 --> 01:46:02.481
You put the key here for me.
What's the game?

01:46:02.561 --> 01:46:06.441
Prostitutes are visiting you, not me.
You are not careful.

01:46:06.521 --> 01:46:13.041
Please don't bring my prostitute
into this, okay? They're decent girls.

01:46:13.121 --> 01:46:17.881
I promise you, I put everything in order.
I thought it out well.

01:46:17.961 --> 01:46:21.321
I wanted to protect you.
You would've given it all away.

01:46:21.401 --> 01:46:23.361
Don't hurt me!

01:46:23.441 --> 01:46:26.681
I'm pregnant.
You're going to be a grandfather.

01:46:44.841 --> 01:46:47.081
- Wendy!
- Hello.

01:46:47.361 --> 01:46:50.041
I've come to wish the family well.

01:46:50.121 --> 01:46:52.921
- Here's a flower for mom.
- Thank you.

01:46:54.081 --> 01:46:57.881
- And a congratulations for dad.
- Thanks. -Zita!

01:46:57.961 --> 01:47:01.601
- Please bring some water for the flower.
- Okay!

01:47:01.681 --> 01:47:06.081
- They're beautiful. What are their names?
- Jan and Rachel.

01:47:06.161 --> 01:47:07.961
I have great news, Jan.

01:47:08.361 --> 01:47:12.841
Your exhibition
will be extended another 2 weeks.

01:47:12.921 --> 01:47:16.121
It's run 6 months already!
That's a record.

01:47:16.201 --> 01:47:19.081
- The highest attendance of all time.
- Bravo.

01:47:19.161 --> 01:47:21.561
They sold every photos. It's fantastic.

01:47:21.641 --> 01:47:26.121
Wendy is the bearer of great news!
Besides, a nurse is a blessing for me!

01:47:26.201 --> 01:47:29.361
Wendy, why are
so many nurse so horribly nasty?

01:47:29.441 --> 01:47:31.521
Because they have it hard, Liba.

01:47:31.601 --> 01:47:34.681
That's why I've decided to
make it easier for Wendy.

01:47:34.761 --> 01:47:38.561
Wendy, show us your hand.
See, a sparkling ring.

01:47:38.641 --> 01:47:41.681
- We've gotten engaged.
- Congratulations!

01:47:43.321 --> 01:47:45.881
- Sit a little longer.
- I have to run.

01:47:45.961 --> 01:47:49.281
- So let's go.
- We'll make up for it another time.

01:47:50.841 --> 01:47:55.001
- Jan's in love.
- He looks happy. I don't recognize him.

01:48:03.041 --> 01:48:06.921
Wendy, I'm crazy about you.
I've never experienced this.

01:48:07.001 --> 01:48:08.801
My love!

01:48:18.281 --> 01:48:22.601
Sorry Jan, but don't turn
this house into a brothel.

01:48:22.681 --> 01:48:27.401
Take your concubines elsewhere!
To the apartment, but not here! Clear?

01:48:27.481 --> 01:48:30.721
- Actually, who was here?
- Wendy. -Yeah, Wendy.

01:48:32.041 --> 01:48:35.481
- Just her? -Watch out,
Wendy works me like 5 others.

01:48:35.561 --> 01:48:37.881
So, you're screwing her only.

01:48:38.881 --> 01:48:41.721
We don't screw. We seem to make love!

01:48:41.841 --> 01:48:45.881
So, you make love?
I've got something to tell you.

01:48:45.961 --> 01:48:49.881
Your Wendy is not
a good influence on you.

01:48:49.961 --> 01:48:53.921
You've entrusted with all
and now you want to get rid off me.

01:48:54.001 --> 01:48:56.601
You're completely off your head too.

01:48:56.681 --> 01:49:00.601
Don't you worry.
Wendy will have different concerns soon.

01:49:00.681 --> 01:49:04.561
- We're expecting your brother-in-law.
- Expecting who?

01:49:04.641 --> 01:49:09.641
- Your hubby will have a little brother.
- What? -Wendy's going to have a baby.

01:49:09.721 --> 01:49:11.521
Are you kidding me?

01:49:12.241 --> 01:49:14.761
Fuck that! You're not serious!

01:49:14.841 --> 01:49:19.241
I wanted to have a child with you!
Then you stopped to sleep with me!

01:49:19.321 --> 01:49:24.361
You stopped because you were afraid
you'd get a vaginal infection!

01:49:24.521 --> 01:49:27.441
Why? Why couldn't it have been me?

01:49:27.601 --> 01:49:30.601
Why couldn't I be
the mother of your child?

01:49:30.681 --> 01:49:33.881
You pig! You shit...

01:49:34.561 --> 01:49:37.081
Cretin! Cretin!

01:49:40.321 --> 01:49:42.121
What're you staring at?

01:49:42.761 --> 01:49:46.761
What's with you? Hunting Jan down?
At least I took care of him.

01:49:46.841 --> 01:49:51.841
- He had to drink to bang you, right?
- Are you afraid for him or for yourself?

01:49:51.921 --> 01:49:53.921
Get the fuck out of here bitch!

01:49:58.401 --> 01:50:00.201
Be careful with them, okay?

01:50:05.281 --> 01:50:09.281
You can't take those pictures
they are already sold!

01:50:09.361 --> 01:50:13.161
Only I handle all sales.
And I have to check them first.

01:50:13.401 --> 01:50:18.441
You don't get it, I have
an exact delivery date to the new owners.

01:50:18.521 --> 01:50:22.441
The deposits were paid long ago.
It was worked out with Jan.

01:50:22.521 --> 01:50:26.601
Jan can't work anything out.
He doesn't have the rights for it.

01:50:28.681 --> 01:50:33.801
I don't understand at all. I'll call him
and he can discuss it with you.

01:50:33.881 --> 01:50:35.681
- Just call him.
- Fine.

01:51:01.561 --> 01:51:03.361
Liba?

01:51:12.561 --> 01:51:14.801
Liba!

01:51:15.641 --> 01:51:17.441
- Yes.
- Liba!

01:51:18.721 --> 01:51:23.601
Where are my things? Where are my
negatives? Absolutely everything is gone!

01:51:23.681 --> 01:51:26.321
In a save place
and about the rest I don't know.

01:51:26.401 --> 01:51:29.961
Don't play this cruel game with me.
Where are they?

01:51:30.041 --> 01:51:34.641
- In the safe! For your own good.
- You just won't let up on the safe!

01:51:34.721 --> 01:51:38.201
I can no longer watch
as you throw everything away.

01:51:38.281 --> 01:51:41.761
Your sluts. You let them walk everywhere.

01:51:41.841 --> 01:51:46.361
You leave them alone in the studio.
Then they piss on the Persian rug.

01:51:46.441 --> 01:51:48.361
I've cleaned it many times.

01:51:48.441 --> 01:51:52.481
Give me my negatives.
I have to make more prints.

01:51:52.561 --> 01:51:56.361
- Where are the photos? -In the safe place!
- Lay off with the safe.

01:51:56.441 --> 01:51:59.361
Where are they?
Almost everything is sold!

01:51:59.441 --> 01:52:03.241
No. I have the exclusive right to
sell your photos and paintings.

01:52:03.321 --> 01:52:07.001
I have the exclusive right to sell.
What rights?

01:52:07.081 --> 01:52:11.801
- Including your future output.
- Since when? I know nothing of this!

01:52:11.881 --> 01:52:16.001
- A long time. And now you know!
- A long time... And now you know!

01:52:16.081 --> 01:52:19.681
Here's our contract for exclusivity,
I'm the sole owner.

01:52:19.761 --> 01:52:24.281
My company is the holder of
all rights' to sell your work.

01:52:24.361 --> 01:52:26.161
What's this?

01:52:29.361 --> 01:52:32.561
- I never saw this.
- Please...

01:52:33.241 --> 01:52:35.721
You signed it. Better than I can.

01:52:35.801 --> 01:52:38.761
I didn't sign anything.
You signed it freely!

01:52:38.841 --> 01:52:43.241
I doubt you remember.
You were drunk. You shouldn't drink.

01:52:43.321 --> 01:52:48.561
- You maliciously tricked me! -Maliciously?
I didn't know you didn't read it.

01:52:49.161 --> 01:52:50.761
Fine.

01:52:50.841 --> 01:52:55.841
What's this here?
You're getting 85% and I'm getting 15%?

01:52:55.921 --> 01:52:58.281
Why would I impoverish myself?

01:52:58.361 --> 01:53:03.161
Naturally, from now on I'll, pay for
this house, trips, all your materials.

01:53:03.241 --> 01:53:07.801
This house is mine.
I'll pay all. Trips, expenses, all.

01:53:07.881 --> 01:53:13.161
You're the self-destructive type! At the
same time a good guy who can't say no.

01:53:13.241 --> 01:53:17.041
No worry, we'll sell everything
and cut gallery's commission.

01:53:17.121 --> 01:53:22.121
No! I arrange everything
from now on! I don't need you!

01:53:22.201 --> 01:53:25.681
You don't have any rights.
I'm in charge of all.

01:53:25.761 --> 01:53:29.841
How come? Give me my things
or I'll see you in the court!

01:53:29.921 --> 01:53:31.881
Court will take years.

01:53:31.961 --> 01:53:35.161
I'm going to sue you,
I'll get my negatives back.

01:53:35.241 --> 01:53:39.401
You'll just waste time and money.

01:53:40.161 --> 01:53:43.081
Be happy
that I'm looking after your affairs.

01:53:43.161 --> 01:53:46.841
I'll be like a child in a sweetshop
if you look after it... Police?

01:53:50.401 --> 01:53:54.281
- Is it quiet in there?
- Yeah, everything's alright.

01:54:01.401 --> 01:54:04.841
The negatives were here.
Please take pictures there.

01:54:04.921 --> 01:54:07.201
And then shoot more there.

01:54:07.721 --> 01:54:10.961
Over there you can take pictures.

01:54:11.081 --> 01:54:14.481
- You're the owner of the house?
- Yes! -What was stolen?

01:54:14.561 --> 01:54:18.201
Everything. 3.000 negatives.
All I've done in my life!

01:54:18.281 --> 01:54:21.841
- Gentlemen.
- Hello. -What's going on here?

01:54:21.921 --> 01:54:25.521
- The gentlemen are investigating
the robbery. -Who are you?

01:54:25.601 --> 01:54:27.721
- I'm the owner.
- Co-owner?

01:54:27.801 --> 01:54:32.081
No, the sole owner. Here,
I've brought you the deed and my I.D.

01:54:32.161 --> 01:54:35.601
- Jan is the grandfather of my child.
- Give me that.

01:54:35.681 --> 01:54:40.081
I bought it. This house belongs to me.
How come your name is here?

01:54:40.161 --> 01:54:43.561
What scam is this?
Don't believe this, this is a sting.

01:54:43.641 --> 01:54:45.441
Some negatives...

01:54:45.521 --> 01:54:49.081
Not some negatives.
I lost my entire life's work.

01:54:49.161 --> 01:54:51.881
Nothing's lost. I've checked everything.

01:54:51.961 --> 01:54:55.361
From what are you concluding
that nothing can be missing?

01:54:55.441 --> 01:54:58.441
I also have a theft report
concerning your studio...

01:54:58.521 --> 01:55:00.681
Yes, they robbed me there also!

01:55:00.761 --> 01:55:05.561
- Who's the owner of that space?
- I'm the owner of it. -No. I'm the owner.

01:55:05.641 --> 01:55:08.001
- Okay.
- So you're the owner.

01:55:08.161 --> 01:55:11.721
Okay. Come by the station tonight.

01:55:11.801 --> 01:55:16.241
- Bring all evidence, the deed.
- Okay. We'll stop by.

01:55:16.321 --> 01:55:20.201
That's everything?
Wait. Not that, I need that.

01:55:20.281 --> 01:55:22.361
We must investigate this here.

01:55:22.441 --> 01:55:25.321
We're taking every step that's necessary.

01:55:25.401 --> 01:55:28.601
I believe you.
But you must do it now, here.

01:55:28.681 --> 01:55:32.201
Why don't you take her fingerprints?

01:55:32.281 --> 01:55:36.761
She has a friend upstairs,
how about if she will take all away,

01:55:36.841 --> 01:55:42.361
I'll never see her again. You're losing
valuable time. Don't walk away, I beg you.

01:55:42.441 --> 01:55:46.841
- One moment!
- Jan, please don't make a scene here.

01:55:46.921 --> 01:55:50.641
- Come on.
- Please don't leave. Stay here.

01:55:50.721 --> 01:55:53.601
- Sit down.
- You have to investigate.

01:55:54.601 --> 01:55:57.161
It's fine. He's a bit hysterical.

01:55:57.241 --> 01:55:59.521
- Have some water. You alright?
- No.

01:55:59.601 --> 01:56:04.161
Excellent. So, like I said,
come by the station tonight. Let's go.

01:56:18.241 --> 01:56:21.361
- You signed the house over to yourself?
- Yes.

01:56:21.441 --> 01:56:25.601
- It won't hold up in court.
- It was paid for from my account.

01:56:25.681 --> 01:56:28.201
That's a scam.

01:56:28.281 --> 01:56:31.721
- De facto it was my account.
- Our courts don't care about it!

01:56:31.801 --> 01:56:35.641
The account was in my name.
My family contributed to the house.

01:56:35.721 --> 01:56:40.721
Where would they get the money? Unless
they sold all the pictures I'd given them.

01:56:40.801 --> 01:56:43.841
No one's throwing you out.
You can live here.

01:56:43.921 --> 01:56:49.041
- You can have the whole bottom floor.
- How could you do this to me?

01:56:50.401 --> 01:56:54.081
I would have done
everything for you, Jan.

01:56:54.161 --> 01:56:55.961
I loved you.

01:56:57.961 --> 01:56:59.761
You didn't love me.

01:57:47.001 --> 01:57:49.641
I'm afraid something happened to him.

01:57:50.721 --> 01:57:53.281
Pull over! Stop... go back.

01:57:54.241 --> 01:57:56.841
This is where he jogs. That'll be him.

01:57:56.961 --> 01:57:59.241
- Where?
- Stop!

01:58:01.441 --> 01:58:04.081
Jan? Jesus. There he is!

01:58:04.801 --> 01:58:07.121
- Jan!
- What are you doing here?

01:58:07.721 --> 01:58:13.121
- Go away. -Get up, dad.
- Grab him. -You can't lie here like this.

01:58:13.721 --> 01:58:18.241
- Lift him up. -There was such
a beautiful quietness here.

01:58:18.321 --> 01:58:20.601
- Good.
- Leave me alone.

01:58:21.041 --> 01:58:24.041
Why is it you just
spoil everything for me?

01:58:35.121 --> 01:58:36.921
What the...

01:58:38.281 --> 01:58:40.601
- I'm in a monastery?
- No.

01:58:41.161 --> 01:58:45.001
We're looking after you.
We're the Sisters of St. Juliana.

01:58:45.081 --> 01:58:49.721
You have pneumonia. You had
a very high fever. You were raving.

01:58:49.801 --> 01:58:51.601
Where's my stuff?

01:58:52.601 --> 01:58:54.361
- Where's my phone?
- Not here.

01:58:54.441 --> 01:58:57.321
Your family didn't want
anyone to disturb you.

01:58:57.401 --> 01:58:59.961
I have a lot of commitments. Let me go.

01:59:00.041 --> 01:59:04.121
- Damn, you're strong, madam.
- No... don't say that word.

01:59:05.601 --> 01:59:08.241
- What? "Madam" bothers you?
- Quiet.

01:59:18.321 --> 01:59:21.921
Congratulations on your
first solo exhibition.

01:59:22.041 --> 01:59:26.521
You raise kids, you look after a firm,
and your photos are a hit.

01:59:26.601 --> 01:59:28.801
Where do you get the strength?

01:59:28.881 --> 01:59:33.441
Right. I've got plenty of strength.
Nothing's really been a burden for me.

01:59:33.521 --> 01:59:38.201
One shouldn't just complain
but must pivot well. That's probably it.

01:59:41.761 --> 01:59:44.881
Who said I have pneumonia?
Was a doctor here?

01:59:44.961 --> 01:59:46.641
Yes.

01:59:46.721 --> 01:59:51.841
Some people criticize
that you imitate the maestro.

01:59:51.921 --> 01:59:54.241
Where'd you get that? Absolutely not!

01:59:54.321 --> 01:59:57.321
He taught me craft,
but that's not a photograph.

01:59:57.401 --> 02:00:00.801
A photo... it's about the soul
and I have an independent one!

02:00:00.881 --> 02:00:04.681
But you make similar scenes
against the maestro's walls.

02:00:04.761 --> 02:00:08.641
Yeah, indeed.
Jan and I inspire one another.

02:00:08.721 --> 02:00:11.961
I have to see someone
but we don't say goodbye yet, right?

02:00:12.041 --> 02:00:13.841
Thank you.

02:00:14.721 --> 02:00:19.041
Where is he?
We know everything. Where's Jan?

02:00:19.121 --> 02:00:20.641
What's it to you?

02:00:20.721 --> 02:00:24.681
No kidding. Return everything
to Jan that belongs to him!

02:00:24.761 --> 02:00:27.841
It's taking a great effort
not to smash your face in.

02:00:27.921 --> 02:00:32.361
Who you think you are? Once in blue moon
you screw him, then you disappeared.

02:00:32.441 --> 02:00:35.761
I was with him when he felt sick.
Don't lecture me here!

02:00:35.841 --> 02:00:38.881
You knew what you were doing.
He never pretended.

02:00:38.961 --> 02:00:43.361
None of his faults gives you
the right to rob the man and destroy him.

02:00:43.441 --> 02:00:47.241
- That's vulturism, lady.
- I've stolen from no one!

02:00:47.321 --> 02:00:49.121
I saved Jan!

02:00:49.361 --> 02:00:51.161
And I saved Jan's work.

02:00:51.841 --> 02:00:54.361
And you, dear, watch your beak.

02:00:54.441 --> 02:00:57.001
Or I'll sue you for slander.

02:00:57.241 --> 02:01:00.121
- Is that clear?
- Pathetic.

02:01:00.361 --> 02:01:04.801
- Where's dad? -If you were more
interested, you'd know. Get lost, brat!

02:01:04.881 --> 02:01:09.641
- How do you dare?
- You too, interloper. No one invited you.

02:01:09.761 --> 02:01:12.361
Hello. I'm... Sorry.

02:01:13.281 --> 02:01:16.721
- Michal Badatel. Do you remember?
- Yeah, I remember.

02:01:16.801 --> 02:01:19.961
Do you know where Jan is?
I haven't been able to find him.

02:01:20.041 --> 02:01:23.281
- You can all get out!
- We are going to call police!

02:01:23.401 --> 02:01:25.401
I'm glad to see you.

02:01:25.481 --> 02:01:29.761
Can you explain to me why are you
so indulgent with these dumb photos

02:01:29.841 --> 02:01:31.961
and heap such scorn on Jan's?

02:01:32.041 --> 02:01:34.841
Dear Vera, because
no one gives a shit here

02:01:34.921 --> 02:01:39.601
about the difference
between mediocrity and genius. That's why.

02:01:41.401 --> 02:01:42.561
A mistake.

02:01:42.641 --> 02:01:45.361
Evidentially, nothing's wrong. Look.

02:01:48.401 --> 02:01:54.161
I can breathe like a diver. Someone
gave me some pills, righteous sisters.

02:01:55.361 --> 02:01:57.161
Are you even a sister?

02:01:57.761 --> 02:01:59.561
Or a virgin?

02:02:00.161 --> 02:02:02.721
I was told you should have total peace!

02:02:02.801 --> 02:02:09.361
Sister of Mercy, may I,
with your love and understanding,

02:02:10.921 --> 02:02:13.641
free your tits from your blouse?

02:02:15.281 --> 02:02:18.481
Do something for this miserable sinner!

02:02:19.921 --> 02:02:23.241
Commit an act of Christian charity
and tell me:

02:02:23.321 --> 02:02:28.481
are you physically equipped
the same as the sinners outside?

02:02:28.601 --> 02:02:32.241
Do you have it... do you have...

02:02:39.521 --> 02:02:41.241
A cunt?

02:02:41.321 --> 02:02:43.121
Return to your bed!

02:02:44.001 --> 02:02:45.801
What is it?

02:02:46.521 --> 02:02:49.121
- What's going on?
- Hello! Open up!

02:02:51.361 --> 02:02:54.481
- We're coming for dad.
- You can't come in here.

02:02:54.561 --> 02:02:56.361
What is that you wearing?

02:02:58.521 --> 02:03:02.521
- Get dressed. -I have nothing.
- Are you okay? -Yeah.

02:03:02.601 --> 02:03:04.401
How'd you find me?

02:03:04.481 --> 02:03:08.001
Marek eventually came
to his senses and told us.

02:03:23.561 --> 02:03:27.601
Dad, the house is yours, after all.
So you'll live here with us.

02:03:27.681 --> 02:03:29.481
Yeah.

02:03:31.521 --> 02:03:35.281
- This is dad and this is Karel.
- Pleased to meet you.

02:03:35.361 --> 02:03:40.041
- Jesus, your belly's big!
- We wanted to tell you. -Congratulations.

02:03:40.121 --> 02:03:41.921
Come on.

02:03:45.241 --> 02:03:48.081
How would you like to prove it?

02:03:48.161 --> 02:03:53.081
The truth is a beautiful thing, but
I have to decide based on the evidence.

02:03:53.161 --> 02:03:59.321
Right now, I have no evidence
that the defendant took your negatives.

02:03:59.401 --> 02:04:03.601
I don't know if I can prove
that the truth is the truth. That's hard.

02:04:03.681 --> 02:04:08.841
One thing I know for certain, even if I
prove it, nothing will be returned to me.

02:04:08.921 --> 02:04:11.241
And the worst bit of this story?

02:04:12.121 --> 02:04:14.441
I can't even look at a photograph.

02:04:16.201 --> 02:04:20.321
Perhaps that's unimportant
sorrow for the people,

02:04:20.401 --> 02:04:22.841
but for me it's fundamental.

02:04:27.121 --> 02:04:31.801
- Thief! -Hush. You're drunk!
- Don't mind her. She's not worth it.

02:04:34.281 --> 02:04:38.601
Jan, wouldn't you like to come by
for lunch some time?

02:04:38.681 --> 02:04:43.041
The kids would love to see
grandpa. Little Jan takes after you a lot.

02:04:43.121 --> 02:04:45.561
He has your talent, always painting.

02:04:58.761 --> 02:05:00.561
Good day, Maestro.

02:05:00.801 --> 02:05:04.081
I've been waiting for you.
Can I talk to you? I'm Natalie.

02:05:04.161 --> 02:05:06.601
Darling,
I don't know who you're. Not today.

02:05:06.681 --> 02:05:12.361
I brought my work with me, if you could
look at it. You were recommended to me.

02:05:12.441 --> 02:05:16.001
Recommended by whom?
Your mother? Do I know her?

02:05:16.081 --> 02:05:17.881
No, probably not.

02:05:18.521 --> 02:05:21.401
What do you have there? Let me see it.

02:05:21.881 --> 02:05:23.681
This one's from school.

02:05:28.561 --> 02:05:34.481
I was thinking that you could use my help
and I could learn something from you.

02:05:34.561 --> 02:05:36.961
Could I work for you?

02:05:39.041 --> 02:05:43.961
That hasn't been here for a long time.
Alright, come. Let's work.

02:05:57.361 --> 02:06:00.441
- God be with you.
- Be well. -Thanks.
