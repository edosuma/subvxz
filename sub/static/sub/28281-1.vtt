MIRAGE

01:00.005 --> 01:02.165
<i>In meteorological terms,
we have to talk</i>

01:02.338 --> 01:04.708
<i>about the arrival of an electrical storm</i>

01:04.962 --> 01:07.963
<i>which will extend throughout
the northern third of the Peninsula.</i>

01:08.130 --> 01:10.960
<i>The great atmospheric instability
has been forming</i>

01:11.130 --> 01:14.510
<i>different supercells
in permanent rotation.</i>

01:14.963 --> 01:17.963
<i>The National Meteorology Institute
predicts that these</i>

01:18.172 --> 01:21.262
<i>will be particularly visible
from tonight</i>

01:21.422 --> 01:24.672
<i>and that they will remain
for the next 72 hours,</i>

01:24.838 --> 01:27.958
<i>leading to strong downpours
that may cause</i>

01:28.172 --> 01:31.842
<i>malfunctions in electrical devices
and problems with communications,</i>

01:32.047 --> 01:34.707
<i>therefore the Civil Guard
has established some rules</i>

01:34.880 --> 01:37.460
<i>as a precaution to protect our people.</i>

01:37.630 --> 01:39.090
<i>We are now able to offer</i>

01:39.255 --> 01:41.415
<i>the emergency story
that we announced previously</i>

01:41.588 --> 01:43.548
<i>which has just arrived
this minute from Berlin.</i>

01:43.713 --> 01:44.731
<i>At the centre of the story</i>

01:44.755 --> 01:46.705
<i>is our special correspondent,
Jose Maria Siles.</i>

01:47.047 --> 01:49.507
<i>Absolute normality
on the streets of East Berlin,</i>

01:49.672 --> 01:50.762
<i>at nightfall.</i>

01:50.963 --> 01:54.213
<i>Only a few onlookers have come
to Brandenburg Gate.</i>

01:54.380 --> 01:56.460
<i>In the West,
at Check Point Charlie,</i>

01:56.630 --> 01:58.380
<i>the crossing point
between both Berlins,</i>

01:58.547 --> 02:01.547
<i>the first onlookers
and television cameras are arriving.</i>

02:01.713 --> 02:03.053
<i>Shortly before midnight, here,</i>

02:03.213 --> 02:06.843
<i>in Neuk√∂lln, the border
has opened informally</i>

02:07.047 --> 02:11.167
<i>for all Germans from the East
that want to come here to the West.</i>

02:11.380 --> 02:13.960
<i>In 27 years, it is the first time</i>

02:14.130 --> 02:17.380
<i>that the Berlin Wall
no longer exists for citizens</i>

02:17.547 --> 02:18.627
<i>from the other Germany.</i>

02:18.797 --> 02:21.377
<i>November 9th, 1989...</i>

03:08.672 --> 03:09.712
Mum.

03:09.963 --> 03:12.053
You just ruined my tape.

03:12.380 --> 03:13.670
I'm going to work.

03:14.505 --> 03:16.955
Don't go to bed too late,
you have class tomorrow, OK?

03:17.130 --> 03:18.460
OK.

03:19.588 --> 03:21.418
Nico, have you recorded my tape?

03:21.588 --> 03:23.258
Yes...

03:31.797 --> 03:33.377
I LOVE YOU, MUM

05:58.838 --> 05:59.878
Ms. Weiss.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.013
Ms. Weiss.

06:26.255 --> 06:27.625
Wait!

06:28.963 --> 06:30.133
Wait!

06:32.380 --> 06:33.510
No!

06:47.338 --> 06:49.168
Help!

06:49.713 --> 06:51.383
Help!

06:51.547 --> 06:52.837
I need help!

06:56.297 --> 06:57.587
Nico!

07:02.755 --> 07:04.415
I need help!

08:16.088 --> 08:18.208
Good morning, my love.

08:21.505 --> 08:23.205
Hey...

08:23.380 --> 08:25.380
Hey...

08:25.547 --> 08:27.797
Come on...

08:28.005 --> 08:29.205
How did you sleep?

08:29.547 --> 08:32.297
I don't like this house, it's cold.

08:32.462 --> 08:34.712
You've only been here one night.

08:35.212 --> 08:36.803
I want my room.

08:37.005 --> 08:40.294
Well, you'll get it soon. Alright?

08:48.005 --> 08:50.005
Hey, come on, let's go!

08:52.672 --> 08:54.132
Hello, darling, are you here?

08:54.297 --> 08:56.507
<i>Yes, I brought my flight forward.</i>

08:56.672 --> 08:58.922
<i>But I have to spend
all day in meetings,</i>

08:59.005 --> 09:00.523
<i>because they
want to review the targets,</i>

09:00.547 --> 09:03.337
they say we don't sell
enough insurance and all that...

09:03.505 --> 09:05.005
<i>I'll be a little late.</i>

09:05.172 --> 09:06.672
Well... Like always...

09:06.838 --> 09:09.668
I'll make it up to you... now confess.

09:10.463 --> 09:11.713
Alright, I slept with her.

09:11.880 --> 09:15.050
- You slept together?
<i>- Yes, we slept together.</i>

09:17.213 --> 09:18.463
I knew it. Put her on.

09:18.630 --> 09:19.630
Wait.

09:22.047 --> 09:24.047
Gloria, talk to Daddy.

09:25.713 --> 09:26.763
Hello, Dad.

09:26.963 --> 09:29.053
Hello, how's my little monster?

09:29.797 --> 09:32.377
Everything smells like paint.

09:32.547 --> 09:33.297
<i>You'll see,</i>

09:33.463 --> 09:35.423
soon it will be
much better than in the city.

09:35.505 --> 09:36.205
- OK?
<i>- OK.</i>

09:36.380 --> 09:39.010
- Has the meeting started?
- They are waiting for you.

09:39.172 --> 09:41.552
A new client, Ms. Velazquez,
is coming tomorrow.

09:41.630 --> 09:42.880
- OK, make a note.
- Alright.

09:43.088 --> 09:45.128
Honey, can I get back to Mum?

09:45.297 --> 09:47.547
- He wants to talk to you.
- Yes?

09:48.505 --> 09:49.795
OK.

09:50.880 --> 09:53.010
<i>Why don't you tell Aitor
to come for dinner?</i>

09:53.172 --> 09:54.212
I'll tell him now.

09:54.797 --> 09:57.127
Hey, I love you.

09:57.838 --> 09:59.838
I love you too.

10:14.338 --> 10:15.958
What are you doing, Mum?

10:16.588 --> 10:18.128
The storm.

10:20.588 --> 10:21.588
It's the same,

10:25.047 --> 10:27.007
the same as years ago.

10:29.672 --> 10:30.672
Well,

10:32.338 --> 10:34.758
I'm going to work.
I'll be right back.

10:35.838 --> 10:37.508
Don't smoke too much, OK?

10:56.505 --> 10:57.835
Careful.

10:58.047 --> 10:59.337
- I wanted to ask.
- Go ahead.

10:59.797 --> 11:01.667
We're leaving.

11:01.838 --> 11:05.508
Can you lock up the door
and leave the key in the house upfront?

11:09.963 --> 11:11.053
Good morning, neighbour!

11:11.213 --> 11:12.513
- Good morning!
- How's it going?

11:13.338 --> 11:16.418
If I was a passenger and saw you in that,
I swear I'd get off the plane.

11:16.963 --> 11:18.383
Where's your husband?

11:18.463 --> 11:20.053
He spent the night in Seville.

11:20.213 --> 11:21.803
- Oh, yes?
- Yes.

11:22.005 --> 11:24.205
He wants to make dinner tonight,
what about it?

11:24.380 --> 11:26.710
I think he's incredibly cheeky, but...

11:26.880 --> 11:28.090
- Stop now!
- But...

11:28.255 --> 11:30.255
Besides that... I fly to Marseilles

11:30.422 --> 11:32.962
and this evening I think
I'll be here, so...

11:33.130 --> 11:34.670
Tell your mother to come.

11:34.797 --> 11:36.707
- Sure?
- It'd be great.

11:36.880 --> 11:38.160
- I'd like to see her.
- Alright.

11:38.213 --> 11:39.593
That's all.

11:39.713 --> 11:41.343
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

11:41.505 --> 11:42.955
Commander!

11:44.213 --> 11:45.713
<i>The electrical storm is expected</i>

11:45.797 --> 11:48.007
<i>to start with force from early tonight</i>

11:48.172 --> 11:50.342
<i>with an approximate duration of 72 hours.</i>

11:50.505 --> 11:53.335
<i>It is the first time astrophysicists
agree on highlighting</i>

11:53.505 --> 11:56.455
<i>the exceptional nature of a phenomenon
that seems to be repeating itself,</i>

11:56.630 --> 11:58.630
<i>as in 1989,</i>

11:58.797 --> 12:01.837
<i>there was a very similar storm,
with a symmetrical structure...</i>

12:01.963 --> 12:03.093
I didn't know you were back.

12:03.505 --> 12:05.795
My holidays were short but intense.

12:06.755 --> 12:08.505
What happened here?

12:08.672 --> 12:10.552
Did a tropical mosquito bite you?

12:10.713 --> 12:12.803
Or did you bring someone
home in your suitcase?

12:13.005 --> 12:14.005
How's the new house?

12:14.172 --> 12:16.422
When did I tell you we've moved?

12:16.588 --> 12:17.838
Half the hospital knows.

12:18.838 --> 12:21.588
Good, honestly
it has all been very quick,

12:21.755 --> 12:23.705
the owner had left
the house years ago,

12:23.880 --> 12:25.170
she was in a hurry to sell it.

12:25.338 --> 12:28.708
It needs some work but that's all,
we can't complain.

12:28.880 --> 12:31.590
But I do.
They're going to open my head.

12:31.755 --> 12:32.755
Don't worry.

12:32.963 --> 12:36.133
Dr. Fell is the best specialist
in craniotomy in the hospital.

12:36.297 --> 12:37.797
Hello.

12:39.338 --> 12:41.338
Ready, Mr. Mendoza?

12:42.338 --> 12:43.338
Here we go.

12:44.713 --> 12:46.013
Good morning.

12:46.172 --> 12:47.422
Hello, Doctor.

12:51.505 --> 12:53.455
Congratulations on the article.

12:53.630 --> 12:54.630
Did you read it?

12:56.797 --> 12:58.417
What happened with Ms. Blanco?

12:59.047 --> 13:00.757
She developed "alequestesia".

13:00.963 --> 13:03.013
Injury of the spinothalamic tract?

13:03.172 --> 13:06.342
No, she required
an anterolateral cordotomy.

13:06.505 --> 13:07.795
Right.

13:09.547 --> 13:13.047
The more I know you, the less
I understand that you quit medicine.

13:13.963 --> 13:17.763
Well, I had Gloria, and...

13:18.213 --> 13:20.963
I don't like to do things halfway.

13:21.963 --> 13:23.013
So you're lucky

13:24.588 --> 13:26.008
that I quit medicine.

13:26.172 --> 13:28.592
Now I would be the best neuro-surgeon
in this hospital.

13:30.630 --> 13:31.840
Hello!

13:33.130 --> 13:34.130
How are you?

13:34.463 --> 13:35.673
Can Greta come home?

13:36.463 --> 13:38.173
If her mum is OK with it...

13:38.338 --> 13:40.128
I'm sure she is.

13:40.297 --> 13:41.507
I'll call her, OK?

13:42.213 --> 13:43.963
Girls... what did we agree on?

13:44.130 --> 13:46.170
Your mother is taking you
to the dentist.

13:46.880 --> 13:49.960
Ah, alright, OK, OK.

13:50.130 --> 13:51.630
I get it...

13:52.338 --> 13:54.208
Are you coming, storyteller?

13:54.380 --> 13:56.210
- Ciao, Miranda.
- Bye, Greta.

14:03.213 --> 14:04.343
Can you see anything?

14:04.505 --> 14:06.585
I promise. I can't see anything.

14:07.463 --> 14:09.673
- Sure you're not cheating?
- No.

14:09.963 --> 14:11.633
Wait.

14:12.422 --> 14:14.012
Nearly...

14:14.588 --> 14:15.588
Ready?

14:15.672 --> 14:16.802
Yes.

14:29.047 --> 14:31.167
You wanna try? Come on!

15:26.755 --> 15:27.955
Hello.

15:29.463 --> 15:32.173
You're going to give me a heart attack.
When did you arrive?

15:32.338 --> 15:33.878
- Half an hour ago.
- Half an hour?

15:34.088 --> 15:35.338
What are you doing?

15:35.505 --> 15:37.665
Organising the books
to make our library.

15:38.255 --> 15:39.255
What's this?

15:40.880 --> 15:42.130
Look.

15:43.047 --> 15:45.457
You were dating her
when we met, right?

15:48.172 --> 15:49.172
And that face?

15:49.213 --> 15:50.423
What face?

15:51.338 --> 15:54.008
- You're jealous.
- No.

15:54.172 --> 15:56.802
I saw it in your eyes,
you're a little jealous.

15:56.880 --> 15:57.880
No, no.

15:58.047 --> 15:59.957
You did get a little bit jealous.

16:00.255 --> 16:01.375
No.

16:01.547 --> 16:04.587
She was very pretty, she is very pretty.
- Show me?

16:05.880 --> 16:08.800
Ursula, maybe I'll call her
one of these days.

16:09.005 --> 16:10.875
So pretty.

16:11.088 --> 16:12.588
What happened here?

16:12.755 --> 16:14.795
- Nothing. I was there...
- With what?

16:14.880 --> 16:15.880
That sign,

16:15.963 --> 16:17.593
I was putting it up and I cut myself.

16:17.755 --> 16:19.205
Did you disinfect it?

16:19.797 --> 16:21.587
Honey, it's a very small cut,

16:21.713 --> 16:24.803
I disinfected it,
and used a band aid, Dr. Roy.

16:24.963 --> 16:27.343
You know that I always liked the idea

16:27.505 --> 16:29.415
that after graduation
everyone would call you

16:29.588 --> 16:32.458
Dr. Vera Roy?
- Alright, enough.

16:32.547 --> 16:34.627
- Alright.
- Yes.

16:34.838 --> 16:36.008
Let's go.

16:40.797 --> 16:41.797
What's this?

16:50.630 --> 16:52.010
Incredible.

16:52.797 --> 16:55.507
This camera must be
at least 20 or 30 years old.

17:08.880 --> 17:10.550
Of course. The tapes.

17:11.338 --> 17:13.377
This has been here since the 80's.

17:14.130 --> 17:16.589
Why don't we call Gloria
and see if it works?

17:41.547 --> 17:42.797
Do you know that this tape

17:43.005 --> 17:46.255
was recorded on today's exact date,
but in 1989?

17:46.422 --> 17:47.422
Seriously?

17:47.505 --> 17:48.625
<i>You just ruined my tape.</i>

17:48.797 --> 17:50.757
- Put another one on.
- That was the last.

17:55.255 --> 17:56.255
Did you like it?

17:56.422 --> 17:58.802
Who's going to keep it?

17:59.005 --> 18:02.755
I'll start making dinner,
because they will be here soon.

18:02.963 --> 18:04.093
Yes, I'll take a shower.

18:07.963 --> 18:09.133
Are you hungry?

18:10.255 --> 18:12.585
<i>Absolute normality
on the streets of East Berlin,</i>

18:12.797 --> 18:14.417
<i>at nightfall.</i>

18:14.588 --> 18:17.838
<i>Only a few onlookers
have come to Brandenburg Gate.</i>

18:18.047 --> 18:19.127
What's this?

18:19.297 --> 18:21.797
<i>At Check Point Charlie,
crossing point between both Berlins...</i>

18:22.005 --> 18:23.005
I don't know.

18:23.172 --> 18:24.592
But there's no tape in.

18:25.005 --> 18:26.165
No.

18:27.088 --> 18:29.758
Besides, now the channels
don't broadcast in analogue.

18:29.880 --> 18:31.300
<i>...has opened informally</i>

18:31.463 --> 18:33.263
<i>for all Germans...</i>

18:43.922 --> 18:46.422
- It doesn't make any sense, David.
- No?

18:46.588 --> 18:49.878
A television signal from 25 years ago?

18:50.172 --> 18:51.962
Did you say hi to Clara?

18:54.213 --> 18:57.093
I swear, the TV came alive.

18:57.255 --> 18:58.415
Came alive?

18:58.588 --> 19:00.128
- Came alive?
- Came alive!

19:00.297 --> 19:02.837
Are you listening
to your crazy husband? Came alive?

19:02.963 --> 19:04.553
Are you still talking about the TV?

19:04.713 --> 19:06.383
Of course we are.

19:06.547 --> 19:08.337
- Cover your ears, honey.
- Why?

19:08.422 --> 19:10.132
I'm going to tell Mum a secret.

19:10.255 --> 19:11.875
Mum and I don't have secrets.

19:13.130 --> 19:14.920
Not even one?

19:16.963 --> 19:19.263
Let's see...
What don't you understand?

19:19.838 --> 19:22.548
- I was the better catch.
- Yeah right!

19:22.672 --> 19:23.672
Stop listening in!

19:23.755 --> 19:26.205
I was a better catch
and you let me go. Why?

19:28.672 --> 19:30.172
What can we say?

19:31.338 --> 19:32.128
Why?

19:32.213 --> 19:35.463
Because some things
are destined to be how they are.

19:37.005 --> 19:37.795
Alright?

19:37.880 --> 19:41.050
- What is this? That hand.
- What's going on?

19:41.130 --> 19:43.090
5 minutes and you're holding hands.

19:43.255 --> 19:44.335
Don't exaggerate.

19:45.255 --> 19:46.955
- Who wants meat?
- Clara.

19:48.963 --> 19:51.013
By the way, why are you still using

19:51.088 --> 19:52.918
that toaster of a TV?

19:53.047 --> 19:55.957
It's just that, I don't know...
Can't you afford to buy...?

19:56.088 --> 19:57.508
Hilarious.

19:57.672 --> 20:00.762
We were watching the tapes
we found, that's all.

20:01.297 --> 20:02.547
There was a boy singing.

20:02.630 --> 20:04.050
A boy singing, eh?

20:04.213 --> 20:05.633
- Do you want some?
- Sure.

20:06.005 --> 20:07.295
Thank you.

20:09.297 --> 20:13.587
That boy was Nico Lasarte.

20:13.755 --> 20:15.455
He was my best friend.

20:17.297 --> 20:19.417
He loved playing the guitar

20:20.005 --> 20:22.915
and always told me
that he would be a rock star.

20:24.255 --> 20:27.665
Mum always took us
to school together.

20:29.380 --> 20:30.960
Until...

20:33.547 --> 20:35.167
the neighbour from next-door

20:35.713 --> 20:38.133
- killed his wife.
- Aitor.

20:39.297 --> 20:40.627
And Nico saw it.

20:41.047 --> 20:42.337
Aitor, enough.

20:44.005 --> 20:45.705
Then he was run over.

20:50.838 --> 20:53.418
On a night like this, with a storm.

20:54.213 --> 20:56.713
Remember that the next day

20:56.922 --> 21:00.512
a lightning hit the facade
of the school, by the clock,

21:00.922 --> 21:03.342
and we had no power
and no class for a week.

21:03.505 --> 21:04.875
Shut up!

21:05.005 --> 21:06.005
Shut up.

21:07.922 --> 21:09.052
Stop it.

21:10.547 --> 21:13.377
You're frightening the girl.
Can't you see?

21:26.630 --> 21:27.710
It's alright,

21:27.922 --> 21:31.842
it's just a lightning storm.

21:32.588 --> 21:34.418
It'll go away, you'll see...

21:34.755 --> 21:37.335
Wanna know a secret?

21:37.505 --> 21:38.835
Lie down.

21:45.047 --> 21:46.127
Look,

21:52.255 --> 21:54.505
when I was 7 years old,

21:54.672 --> 21:59.012
I was really, really frightened
by storms, just like you,

21:59.338 --> 22:01.088
you know what I did?

22:02.172 --> 22:03.382
Look,

22:03.588 --> 22:06.378
I took Granny's music box

22:08.505 --> 22:09.955
and watched the ballerina.

22:11.505 --> 22:13.625
I watched her dance

22:13.838 --> 22:15.958
and I forgot about everything.

22:16.297 --> 22:18.877
I watched her dance, dance,

22:19.880 --> 22:22.340
until I fell asleep.

22:24.130 --> 22:25.960
You wanna try?

22:40.463 --> 22:43.633
ANGEL PRIETO
COMMITS SUICIDE IN HIS CELL

22:44.838 --> 22:45.588
Does it hurt?

22:45.672 --> 22:47.842
Why don't you get it checked?

22:48.422 --> 22:51.552
He killed himself
3 months after entering prison.

22:51.713 --> 22:55.173
Here it says he owned an abattoir

22:55.338 --> 22:58.088
and was going to bury his wife
underneath it.

22:58.255 --> 23:00.585
Who confesses something
he was going to do

23:00.755 --> 23:03.415
but didn't because
he was arrested first?

23:04.880 --> 23:07.010
Why don't we change the subject?

23:07.172 --> 23:09.302
Someone who says
what he would have done

23:09.380 --> 23:13.630
but didn't do it,
that's not a common killer.

23:13.922 --> 23:15.842
Are you a psychologist now?

23:15.963 --> 23:18.463
No, but it's strange. Don't you think so?

23:18.880 --> 23:20.590
Are they dirty?

23:23.672 --> 23:26.592
I love when you make that face,
when you don't like something.

23:26.672 --> 23:28.552
Your nose wrinkles, turns up...

23:28.713 --> 23:30.133
- No
- Yes.

23:30.297 --> 23:33.457
Your nose goes like this, wrinkled.
Like a rabbit face.

23:33.547 --> 23:35.507
- Oh, yes?
- A tiny rabbit.

23:35.588 --> 23:37.048
- An ugly rabbit.
- What's this?

23:39.380 --> 23:41.090
Have you been smoking?

23:48.255 --> 23:50.295
Are you controlling me?

23:51.463 --> 23:52.513
What?

23:52.588 --> 23:54.628
Are you controlling me?

24:01.963 --> 24:04.303
Come on, honey, I'm joking.

24:04.463 --> 24:06.803
You always fall for it, you know me.

24:06.963 --> 24:08.133
I like jokes.

24:08.297 --> 24:10.087
Yesterday in the hotel, in Seville,

24:10.172 --> 24:13.172
- I went to the caf√©...
- You don't have to explain.

24:13.255 --> 24:14.955
I had one and dumped the rest.

24:15.130 --> 24:17.170
- I promise. Let's do something.
- OK.

24:17.338 --> 24:18.338
Look.

24:20.338 --> 24:21.418
Done.

24:22.130 --> 24:23.420
- Nothing happened.
- OK.

24:23.588 --> 24:26.338
- Like nothing happened. Really?
- Yes, yes.

24:51.172 --> 24:54.462
<i>...we're able to offer the emergency
story that we announced previously</i>

24:54.630 --> 24:56.470
<i>which has just arrived
this minute from Berlin.</i>

25:35.547 --> 25:37.957
<i>...the border has opened informally</i>

25:38.088 --> 25:41.958
<i>for all Germans from the East
that want to come here to the West.</i>

25:42.088 --> 25:43.588
<i>In 27 years,</i>

25:43.797 --> 25:47.707
<i>it is the first time
that the Berlin Wall no longer exists</i>

25:47.922 --> 25:50.962
<i>for citizens from the other Germany.</i>

25:51.797 --> 25:54.417
<i>November 9th, 1989,</i>

25:54.588 --> 25:57.918
<i>is a day for the history of Germany
and Europe as a whole.</i>

25:58.047 --> 26:01.297
<i>This couple has just arrived
and can't believe it.</i>

26:01.463 --> 26:04.053
<i>They just had to present
their identity card,</i>

26:04.213 --> 26:06.673
<i>and they received a stamp.</i>

26:06.880 --> 26:11.510
<i>It is their first time in the West,
but they don't intend to stay.</i>

26:11.672 --> 26:13.922
<i>At home, in the East, on the other side,</i>

26:14.047 --> 26:17.547
<i>their son is waiting,
and they work at 8 am.</i>

27:29.797 --> 27:30.877
<i>Nico,</i>

27:31.297 --> 27:32.917
<i>I'm going to work.</i>

27:33.255 --> 27:35.335
<i>Mum, the camera broke.</i>

27:36.380 --> 27:39.090
<i>Don't go to bed late,
you have class tomorrow, OK?</i>

27:39.172 --> 27:40.262
<i>OK.</i>

27:40.630 --> 27:43.340
<i>Nico, have you recorded my tape?</i>

27:44.047 --> 27:45.047
<i>Yes.</i>

28:03.880 --> 28:04.960
<i>Hello?</i>

28:07.130 --> 28:08.130
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

28:25.797 --> 28:26.797
<i>Hello?</i>

28:33.047 --> 28:34.127
<i>Can you see me?</i>

28:35.172 --> 28:36.172
Yes.

28:39.297 --> 28:42.007
Yes, I can see you.

28:42.713 --> 28:44.303
<i>How do you do it?</i>

28:45.713 --> 28:47.593
- How do I do what?
<i>- Hold on!</i>

28:47.672 --> 28:50.462
<i>That sign is the same
as the Valpineda station.</i>

28:53.213 --> 28:54.213
What?

28:54.297 --> 28:56.047
<i>It's the same,</i>

28:57.213 --> 28:59.263
<i>just worn out.</i>

29:00.922 --> 29:02.382
It's the same one.

29:02.463 --> 29:03.883
<i>How do you have it?</i>

29:05.088 --> 29:06.588
We stole it.

29:08.047 --> 29:09.457
My husband and I stole it.

29:09.922 --> 29:10.922
I don't understand.

29:10.963 --> 29:14.303
<i>Aitor, your neighbour,
introduced me to David,</i>

29:14.963 --> 29:16.263
<i>my husband,</i>

29:16.922 --> 29:18.802
<i>I met Aitor at Valpineda station.</i>

29:18.963 --> 29:20.213
Aitor Medina!

29:20.380 --> 29:21.800
<i>Wait, wait!</i>

29:21.922 --> 29:23.672
His mother takes you to school.

29:23.838 --> 29:25.418
<i>Do you know why I know?</i>

29:30.213 --> 29:32.303
<i>I know because it already happened.</i>

29:33.297 --> 29:35.507
What already happened?

29:37.005 --> 29:39.415
<i>- What is it?</i>
- Shouting, outside.

29:39.588 --> 29:41.008
<i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>

29:44.297 --> 29:45.297
<i>Nico!</i>

29:45.963 --> 29:47.213
<i>Nico, come back!</i>

29:48.505 --> 29:50.505
<i>How do you know my name?</i>

29:53.088 --> 29:54.548
<i>You used to live here.</i>

29:54.630 --> 29:56.090
<i>Here, where?</i>

29:57.672 --> 29:59.262
Something's wrong next door.

29:59.338 --> 30:01.798
Don't go, please, you shouldn't go.

30:01.963 --> 30:03.013
Wait.

30:03.172 --> 30:04.172
Am I dreaming?

30:04.213 --> 30:04.963
<i>No.</i>

30:05.130 --> 30:06.510
<i>Wait.
Look what I have, look.</i>

30:06.838 --> 30:07.838
<i>Look.</i>

30:08.255 --> 30:09.085
<i>See?</i>

30:09.172 --> 30:10.302
<i>See?</i>

30:11.213 --> 30:14.133
My tapes.
How did you get those?

30:14.547 --> 30:16.417
Nico, I live in your house.

30:16.588 --> 30:19.548
This is your house, in 25 years time.

30:19.630 --> 30:20.630
What?

30:20.713 --> 30:21.713
<i>Look.</i>

30:22.088 --> 30:24.128
<i>I'm going to show you something.</i>

30:25.005 --> 30:26.375
<i>Look,</i>

30:26.547 --> 30:27.547
<i>see?</i>

30:29.588 --> 30:31.168
CHILD KILLED IN VALPINEDA

30:31.463 --> 30:33.713
<i>This is you, if you go outside.</i>

30:34.338 --> 30:35.338
No...

30:35.463 --> 30:37.173
- It's a trick. How do you do it?
<i>- No.</i>

30:37.255 --> 30:39.835
No, no! It's not, it's real.

30:39.963 --> 30:41.463
<i>- This is real.</i>
- You're lying.

30:41.630 --> 30:42.840
<i>Nico, wait!</i>

30:42.963 --> 30:46.383
<i>I know what's going to happen
at your school tomorrow.</i>

30:47.047 --> 30:50.837
<i>Lightning is going to hit
the clock at the entrance,</i>

30:50.963 --> 30:54.803
<i>the entire school will lose power
and the classes will be cancelled.</i>

30:54.963 --> 30:58.013
<i>If you stay in your room,
you'll see I'm right,</i>

30:59.005 --> 31:02.585
<i>but if you go outside,
tomorrow you will be dead.</i>

31:02.797 --> 31:03.797
<i>Nico,</i>

31:04.255 --> 31:06.545
<i>Nico, Nico, Nico, please,</i>

31:06.713 --> 31:08.923
<i>please don't go, don't go outside,</i>

31:09.047 --> 31:11.547
<i>Nico please, please, wait! Wait!</i>

31:11.630 --> 31:12.800
<i>Stay inside!</i>

31:12.880 --> 31:14.800
Nico, please don't go outside.

31:14.963 --> 31:16.673
Don't go, a car will hit you!

31:16.755 --> 31:19.335
When you cross the road it will hit you!

31:19.505 --> 31:20.705
Nico, please!

31:20.922 --> 31:23.302
Please, no!

31:59.922 --> 32:00.962
Yes?

32:01.088 --> 32:03.878
<i>Maria, it's Clara, did I wake you?</i>

32:04.088 --> 32:06.208
No. I'm just back from work.

32:06.380 --> 32:09.420
<i>I don't feel well, my brother will
bring the kids to school, OK?</i>

32:09.588 --> 32:11.708
Alright, don't worry.

32:11.963 --> 32:13.633
Feel better soon.

32:16.255 --> 32:17.955
Why are you awake?

32:18.255 --> 32:20.165
Aitor's mother isn't well,

32:20.338 --> 32:22.798
her brother will bring you
to school, OK?

32:28.547 --> 32:29.587
Nico.

32:31.088 --> 32:34.708
Mum, I dreamed without sleeping.

32:37.422 --> 32:40.802
A woman from the future
spoke to me through the TV.

33:25.005 --> 33:26.005
Vera!

33:26.172 --> 33:28.172
They're waiting for you in the OR.

33:48.255 --> 33:49.455
Why is he here?

33:49.630 --> 33:52.960
Mr. Mendoza
has cerebrovascular insufficiency.

33:53.422 --> 33:56.262
Yes, Dr. Fell
operated on him yesterday.

33:58.797 --> 34:00.547
Mr. Mendoza is your patient.

34:03.213 --> 34:04.263
What?

34:05.422 --> 34:07.672
Vera. We need to open him up now.

34:11.088 --> 34:14.047
Dr. Roy, are you ready to get dressed?

34:17.505 --> 34:19.005
What did you call me?

34:20.005 --> 34:21.005
Sorry?

34:22.088 --> 34:23.918
What's happening here?

34:24.672 --> 34:26.632
What is this? What are you doing?

34:29.338 --> 34:30.878
Dr. Roy.

34:31.297 --> 34:32.547
Are you alright?

34:42.005 --> 34:43.875
Come on, we're late.

34:44.005 --> 34:46.955
Nico, careful with the skateboard,
the other day...

34:47.088 --> 34:49.168
I'll be back at 5, OK?

34:53.797 --> 34:55.507
What happened, uncle Roman?

34:55.797 --> 34:58.257
I don't know. Let's ask.

35:03.713 --> 35:05.383
Excuse me, miss.

35:05.630 --> 35:06.710
Is there a problem?

35:07.422 --> 35:10.632
The storm caused an electrical fault,
there's no power.

35:10.963 --> 35:12.213
Class is suspended.

35:12.588 --> 35:13.798
Oh...

35:15.172 --> 35:17.092
Come on kids, let's go home.

35:32.338 --> 35:34.878
Hi Greta, have you seen Gloria?

35:35.005 --> 35:36.125
Gloria who?

35:36.297 --> 35:38.127
Gloria, my daughter.

35:38.380 --> 35:41.260
I'm her mum.
Don't you remember me?

35:41.422 --> 35:42.592
No.

35:50.005 --> 35:51.005
Hello, Miranda.

35:51.047 --> 35:52.507
Pablo, go to class.

35:53.588 --> 35:54.588
Can I help you?

35:54.630 --> 35:57.760
Yes, I'm looking for Gloria.
Can I see her a minute?

35:58.588 --> 36:00.088
Gloria...

36:00.338 --> 36:02.548
Gloria, Gloria Ortiz. Gloria is...

36:02.713 --> 36:04.013
Miranda, I'm Vera!

36:04.880 --> 36:06.590
I'm sorry, I don't know you.

36:08.797 --> 36:10.587
I'm looking for my daughter.

36:22.130 --> 36:23.840
Class is suspended.

36:24.172 --> 36:27.262
Nico forgot his keys
and his mother's asleep.

36:27.630 --> 36:30.630
Clara, I have to go to the airport.

36:32.838 --> 36:34.048
Go on, kids!

36:47.838 --> 36:49.298
Hi Lidia. I'm here to see David.

36:49.463 --> 36:50.463
Ms. Velazquez?

36:50.547 --> 36:53.507
He's waiting in his office.
Go through.

36:58.797 --> 37:00.007
David!

37:00.547 --> 37:01.707
What's happening?

37:02.588 --> 37:04.378
Lidia doesn't recognise me.

37:04.630 --> 37:06.630
I went to Gloria's school,
she's not there.

37:06.838 --> 37:08.378
They say she's not a student.

37:08.547 --> 37:10.547
Her teacher doesn't know me

37:10.713 --> 37:13.343
and her friend Greta
doesn't know who she is either.

37:13.505 --> 37:15.045
Where did you leave Gloria?

37:15.213 --> 37:17.633
Sorry.
You're not Ms. Velazquez, right?

37:18.630 --> 37:20.420
David, enough, really.

37:20.588 --> 37:23.708
Really, that's enough. I'm really tired...

37:26.422 --> 37:28.172
Son of a bitch! Damn German.

37:28.255 --> 37:29.625
Who is German!

37:29.713 --> 37:31.173
I believed you for a second!

37:31.338 --> 37:34.338
- You were great! Brilliant!
- That's enough, David!

37:34.505 --> 37:36.255
- Not funny.
- Don't touch.

37:36.422 --> 37:39.302
David, it's me!
Quit the fucking joke, David!

37:39.880 --> 37:41.670
- Tell me where Gloria is.
- Enough.

37:41.755 --> 37:43.915
Who the hell are you
and who is Gloria?

37:44.047 --> 37:45.707
Gloria is our daughter!

37:53.005 --> 37:56.755
Nico told me that last night he heard
shouting in Mr. Prieto's house.

37:57.588 --> 38:01.128
A woman screamed, it was scary.

38:01.505 --> 38:03.955
Maybe it was Ms. Weiss.

38:04.130 --> 38:05.340
What do you think, Mum?

38:08.047 --> 38:10.457
Did you see or hear
anything else, Nico?

38:10.630 --> 38:12.840
No, because the TV...

38:13.963 --> 38:16.513
I looked out the window, but nothing.

38:17.297 --> 38:20.007
We spied from my room,
and you know what?

38:20.172 --> 38:21.552
The blinds are down

38:21.630 --> 38:24.340
and Bruno is tied
to the shed, howling.

38:24.422 --> 38:28.052
Mr. Prieto always feeds him
in the morning, but not today.

38:30.963 --> 38:32.263
Aitor,

38:33.838 --> 38:36.708
do you believe in time travel?

38:37.880 --> 38:40.800
POLICE STATION

38:40.963 --> 38:42.593
What can I say?

38:42.755 --> 38:44.455
I didn't start this.

38:44.630 --> 38:47.420
I don't know why David,
or my daughter's school

38:47.505 --> 38:50.335
act like I'm someone I'm not.

38:52.588 --> 38:56.048
I know it seems like I'm lying,
or crazy,

38:56.880 --> 39:01.920
but the only thing I can think of
is that it's a type of joke.

39:02.505 --> 39:04.045
Can you help me?

39:04.213 --> 39:06.053
Yes, I can help you,

39:07.297 --> 39:09.957
but first I need
to ask you some questions.

39:13.672 --> 39:16.462
When was the last time
you saw your daughter?

39:17.797 --> 39:19.507
Last night.

39:21.088 --> 39:22.508
She was scared,

39:23.338 --> 39:25.838
she was frightened of the storm.

39:26.213 --> 39:28.173
And the man you say
is your husband?

39:28.672 --> 39:30.342
David Ortiz is my husband.

39:31.338 --> 39:33.958
What is the last thing
you remember with him?

39:34.088 --> 39:37.008
Last night, too.

39:37.255 --> 39:39.165
Your nose wrinkles up...

39:39.338 --> 39:40.338
<i>Before bed...</i>

39:40.463 --> 39:41.803
- Yes?
- Like a rabbit.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.130
<i>He lied about something silly.</i>

39:44.297 --> 39:45.837
<i>He'd been smoking.</i>

39:47.297 --> 39:48.337
Nothing else?

39:51.463 --> 39:53.423
I don't understand the questions.

39:53.588 --> 39:55.128
I'm trying to see it.

39:55.255 --> 39:57.335
I think we're wasting time.

39:58.463 --> 39:59.843
Vera.

40:00.797 --> 40:04.417
If you want me to help you,
you have to help me to understand.

40:04.713 --> 40:06.093
The smallest details.

40:06.255 --> 40:07.255
Alright.

40:08.672 --> 40:12.882
Before everything changed,
what is the last thing you remember?

40:14.713 --> 40:17.593
The story of the boy
who lived in our house.

40:19.963 --> 40:23.963
A neighbour of Aitor Medina, our friend.

40:25.588 --> 40:27.548
Aitor told us that he died.

40:27.880 --> 40:29.130
Hit by a car

40:29.255 --> 40:31.585
running out of another house.

40:31.755 --> 40:34.255
A man... it all sounds sinister,

40:34.422 --> 40:36.882
a man killed his wife, and...

40:37.047 --> 40:38.707
the boy found out.

40:41.213 --> 40:43.263
Continue, please.

40:44.672 --> 40:45.762
Then...

40:46.880 --> 40:48.920
Then I think I dreamed about him.

40:51.338 --> 40:54.798
He appeared
on an old television, and...

40:55.672 --> 40:56.672
<i>Hello?</i>

40:56.797 --> 40:58.837
<i>Before he died, I tried to save him.</i>

40:58.963 --> 40:59.883
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

40:59.963 --> 41:01.513
I tried to warn him, to save him.

41:03.838 --> 41:05.628
Do you remember the boy's name?

41:08.380 --> 41:09.880
Nico Lasarte.

41:12.297 --> 41:13.507
And then...

41:14.088 --> 41:16.088
Something very strange happened.

41:16.255 --> 41:19.545
<i>Nico, please, please, no...</i>

41:23.297 --> 41:25.257
<i>I don't remember anything else.</i>

41:31.588 --> 41:34.758
All I can say right now
is that you are confused.

41:36.380 --> 41:37.800
We have verified that...

41:38.380 --> 41:42.300
you don't live where you said,
you're not married to David Ortiz.

41:44.505 --> 41:47.045
There is no birth certificate
for your daughter.

41:47.797 --> 41:49.507
She officially was not born.

41:49.672 --> 41:51.962
We haven't found
a single photo of her.

41:52.380 --> 41:53.800
You don't have any.

41:54.255 --> 41:55.795
Nobody has ever seen her, Vera.

41:58.422 --> 41:59.882
The life you speak of

42:01.922 --> 42:03.512
only exists in your mind.

42:33.463 --> 42:34.463
Hello?

42:39.963 --> 42:41.553
Are you there?

42:41.880 --> 42:43.260
Answer me!

43:02.672 --> 43:05.342
Here's the passport, ticket and Marks.

43:10.963 --> 43:12.093
Thank you.

43:42.797 --> 43:43.957
How is she, Doctor?

43:44.172 --> 43:46.172
Good, this is the last test.

43:48.047 --> 43:51.797
The results don't show
any anatomic alteration.

43:52.838 --> 43:55.088
Your brain's activity is optimal,

43:55.255 --> 43:58.625
so we can dismiss
any neurological impairment.

44:05.588 --> 44:09.298
He was your first intervention
leading a surgical team.

44:09.922 --> 44:12.632
You extracted
a meningioma from his brain.

44:13.338 --> 44:16.298
Whatever you know about him,
here is the answer.

44:16.463 --> 44:17.463
It's true.

44:17.547 --> 44:20.007
David had a meningioma removed,
I remember.

44:21.047 --> 44:24.127
But it wasn't me, I don't operate.

44:24.297 --> 44:27.877
You're the neurosurgeon,
I wasn't even in the post-operative

44:27.963 --> 44:30.673
because I had the flu. Monica took over.

44:34.005 --> 44:35.005
Come with me.

44:52.963 --> 44:54.303
This is your office.

44:56.547 --> 44:58.337
Look around and you will remember.

45:14.047 --> 45:16.587
You're the best neurosurgeon
in the hospital.

45:17.547 --> 45:20.837
You joined my team
before finishing your speciality.

45:28.047 --> 45:31.667
It's impossible that all my memories
are a distortion.

45:31.880 --> 45:35.630
You should go home.
The surroundings will help you remember.

45:35.797 --> 45:37.207
Gloria is my daughter.

45:43.255 --> 45:44.795
Lorena Garc√≠a.

45:45.255 --> 45:47.915
<i>She died twelve days ago,
in theatre.</i>

45:49.047 --> 45:50.957
<i>It had never happened you before.</i>

45:52.463 --> 45:55.593
<i>Nobody wanted to operate on her,
but you took the risk.</i>

45:56.588 --> 45:59.418
<i>It was an impossible case,
even for you.</i>

46:03.088 --> 46:06.338
<i>They prescribed sedatives,
and a few days of rest.</i>

46:15.380 --> 46:18.800
You returned this morning
for Mr. Mendoza's operation,

46:19.463 --> 46:21.843
but we can extend your leave.

46:24.130 --> 46:26.630
Vera, you blocked out Lorena Garc√≠a,

46:27.463 --> 46:30.343
but speak of Gloria Ortiz,
an imaginary girl

46:30.505 --> 46:31.755
you give life to.

46:32.047 --> 46:34.257
You made up David Ortiz
as your husband

46:34.422 --> 46:37.762
because you've joined
your first patient to your last.

46:39.672 --> 46:41.552
Your mind has drawn a circle.

46:56.255 --> 46:57.955
There must be another explanation.

46:58.755 --> 46:59.835
Which?

47:08.880 --> 47:10.210
Where are you going?

47:10.380 --> 47:11.550
Vera!

47:13.213 --> 47:14.513
What are you doing?

47:15.297 --> 47:17.627
What is it, Vera?
Where are you going?

47:21.547 --> 47:23.547
- You're frightened...
- No, no...

47:23.713 --> 47:24.843
I'm not scared.

47:24.963 --> 47:27.883
I'm starting to understand
many things, really.

47:28.047 --> 47:29.047
What?

47:30.130 --> 47:31.840
The strange things,

47:32.047 --> 47:35.167
this entire situation
started with the storm.

47:35.880 --> 47:38.960
- That might have changed everything.
- Changed, how?

47:39.172 --> 47:41.922
What do you mean
that you changed everything?

47:42.505 --> 47:43.545
Vera!

47:45.255 --> 47:46.915
Maybe I saved that boy.

47:48.047 --> 47:50.257
I have to know if he died or is alive.

47:50.422 --> 47:51.422
Why?

47:52.463 --> 47:54.553
To get my daughter back.

48:02.213 --> 48:03.213
Vera!

48:03.713 --> 48:04.883
Vera!

48:07.213 --> 48:08.263
Vera,

48:08.880 --> 48:10.460
open the door, please.

50:08.380 --> 50:09.460
Hello?

51:58.963 --> 52:00.843
<i>√Ångel, don't worry.</i>

52:01.047 --> 52:02.627
<i>Everything's under control.</i>

56:31.922 --> 56:33.132
<i>Do you want to try?</i>

56:33.213 --> 56:34.213
<i>Let's go!</i>

57:21.047 --> 57:23.257
NICO LASARTE - MURDERED - 1989

57:32.130 --> 57:35.460
NICO LASARTE IS A CHARACTER
CREATED BY KAREN SARDON

57:38.172 --> 57:39.882
I've got you, bitch.

57:40.047 --> 57:41.127
- Relax.
- Stop.

57:41.297 --> 57:42.377
Stop.

57:42.547 --> 57:43.877
You broke in.

57:43.963 --> 57:45.053
- No.
- Stop.

57:45.380 --> 57:47.380
What are you doing in my house?

57:47.838 --> 57:48.838
Mine.

57:48.963 --> 57:49.963
What?

57:50.088 --> 57:51.918
- My house.
- What did you say?

57:52.088 --> 57:54.588
And it was a boy's house, too.
Nico Lasarte.

57:54.672 --> 57:56.462
I don't know what this is about.

57:56.547 --> 57:59.337
I just want to know if he's OK,
where he is.

57:59.463 --> 58:01.133
- What?
- There was a...

58:01.297 --> 58:03.337
an old TV and a camera.

58:03.505 --> 58:05.955
There was a connection with the storm.

58:06.547 --> 58:07.667
Everything changed.

58:07.755 --> 58:09.665
- Honey?
- Love! Come up!

58:09.797 --> 58:11.077
- Are you OK?
- I'm in the attic.

58:11.130 --> 58:14.130
- What happened the door?
- They broke in, come up!

58:26.130 --> 58:27.210
Love...

58:27.422 --> 58:28.762
I can't believe it, you?

58:28.838 --> 58:30.128
Do you know her?

58:30.297 --> 58:31.957
She came to my office today.

58:32.130 --> 58:33.210
- What?
- Call the police,

58:33.297 --> 58:35.007
tell them she's an intruder.

58:35.088 --> 58:35.798
David.

58:35.880 --> 58:38.420
- David, I need your help.
- Stop. Don't move.

58:38.505 --> 58:41.835
Hello, I called a while ago
because someone broke in.

58:41.963 --> 58:42.963
Ursula Abad.

58:43.172 --> 58:44.422
Stop.

58:44.588 --> 58:45.918
She came back in...

58:46.088 --> 58:47.168
David, listen to me.

58:47.338 --> 58:49.088
- Are they coming?
- Yes, now.

58:49.255 --> 58:50.625
David, please.

58:50.797 --> 58:52.757
Stop using my name
like you know me.

58:52.922 --> 58:54.342
We know each other.

58:54.505 --> 58:57.915
The police told me she was the one
who removed the meningioma.

58:58.088 --> 59:00.338
- Are you a neurosurgeon?
- No.

59:00.713 --> 59:03.843
I left neurosurgery
when Gloria was born.

59:04.380 --> 59:05.880
You wanted to study a master

59:06.630 --> 59:09.630
to show your father
you could be better than him.

59:10.297 --> 59:13.627
You didn't ask me to,
but I supported you.

59:15.588 --> 59:17.258
Who is Gloria?

59:19.630 --> 59:21.210
Gloria is our daughter.

59:23.130 --> 59:24.300
What?

59:24.755 --> 59:27.415
I swear I don't know
what she's talking about.

59:27.838 --> 59:29.258
I swear, she's lying.

59:30.797 --> 59:33.047
- Who the fuck do you think you are?
- No, no!

59:35.297 --> 59:36.417
Leave me!

59:37.713 --> 59:39.593
Where is she, David?

59:39.755 --> 59:41.505
- I don't know.
- David!

59:42.047 --> 59:43.457
I don't know!

01:00:33.797 --> 01:00:34.957
What is it?

01:00:37.838 --> 01:00:39.628
The whole street lost power.

01:00:42.463 --> 01:00:44.173
What is the police doing here?

01:00:47.172 --> 01:00:48.262
I don't know.

01:01:21.422 --> 01:01:22.592
Inspector Leira.

01:01:22.963 --> 01:01:24.093
- Hello.
- Good evening.

01:01:24.255 --> 01:01:25.455
Is something wrong?

01:01:25.630 --> 01:01:27.960
No, we're looking for this woman.

01:01:28.755 --> 01:01:29.955
Have you seen her?

01:01:30.672 --> 01:01:31.922
- No.
- No.

01:01:32.172 --> 01:01:34.212
Is she OK?
Has she done something?

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:35.590
She's just disoriented.

01:01:37.338 --> 01:01:38.338
Sorry.

01:01:39.172 --> 01:01:40.422
Good night.

01:01:44.672 --> 01:01:45.712
What is it, Mum?

01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:48.460
A crazy woman broke into
David and Ursula's house

01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:50.130
and we think she hid at home.

01:01:50.338 --> 01:01:52.298
Don't worry, we're fine.

01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:54.460
I'll check on them and go to work.

01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:57.210
Haven't they cancelled the flights
because of the storm?

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:59.170
I've flown in worse, Mum.

01:01:59.338 --> 01:02:03.418
Tell uncle Roman to come tomorrow.
It's Angel's birthday.

01:02:03.588 --> 01:02:04.628
Sure.

01:02:09.047 --> 01:02:11.297
We can confirm that the lock
has been broken.

01:02:33.463 --> 01:02:34.713
Are you OK?

01:03:20.422 --> 01:03:21.422
Yes?

01:03:21.588 --> 01:03:23.548
<i>Angel, it's me.</i>

01:03:25.088 --> 01:03:26.088
<i>Angel.</i>

01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:29.340
- Where are you calling from?
<i>- The booth by your house.</i>

01:03:31.088 --> 01:03:32.668
Alright, calm down.

01:03:33.088 --> 01:03:34.338
Calm down.

01:03:34.505 --> 01:03:35.665
<i>Listen to me...</i>

01:03:36.338 --> 01:03:39.088
<i>you don't understand... I realised...</i>

01:03:39.255 --> 01:03:40.755
<i>my watch... in your house...</i>

01:03:40.922 --> 01:03:42.422
I don't hear you well, what?

01:03:42.588 --> 01:03:43.918
<i>My watch.</i>

01:03:44.755 --> 01:03:46.795
- What?
<i>- I don't have my watch.</i>

01:03:46.963 --> 01:03:48.843
<i>I left my watch, I can't find it.</i>

01:03:48.963 --> 01:03:50.963
- Your watch?
<i>- I don't have it.</i>

01:03:51.755 --> 01:03:53.625
<i>It must be in your house,
on the floor.</i>

01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:57.300
- You didn't take it?
<i>- No, I don't have it.</i>

01:03:57.463 --> 01:04:00.553
<i>- Look for it, it must be there.</i>
- OK, don't worry.

01:04:00.797 --> 01:04:03.667
If you left it here, it's here. OK?

01:04:03.963 --> 01:04:06.963
- Listen, do what I told you.
<i>- Yes, of course.</i>

01:04:07.338 --> 01:04:09.168
I have the passport.

01:04:09.755 --> 01:04:11.335
We'll talk before you leave, OK?

01:04:11.463 --> 01:04:12.513
OK.

01:04:12.963 --> 01:04:15.383
<i>I'll be at the bar near the airport.</i>

01:04:15.547 --> 01:04:17.507
- I love you.
<i>- I love you, too.</i>

01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:18.880
<i>A lot.</i>

01:05:08.505 --> 01:05:09.505
Mum?

01:05:11.297 --> 01:05:12.417
Aitor.

01:05:14.088 --> 01:05:15.338
Sweetheart...

01:05:18.588 --> 01:05:22.838
I have to go to Erej√≥n for a while,
to the new office.

01:05:23.547 --> 01:05:25.797
Uncle Roman will take care of you.

01:05:26.755 --> 01:05:29.255
I'll visit you as often as I can.

01:05:44.088 --> 01:05:45.088
Fuck!

01:05:45.213 --> 01:05:46.803
Who the fuck are you?

01:05:47.130 --> 01:05:49.340
Listen, I know
what this car means to you.

01:05:49.505 --> 01:05:51.165
What the fuck do you want?

01:05:51.255 --> 01:05:54.625
You bought it from your uncle Roman
while in flight school.

01:05:54.797 --> 01:05:56.127
Who are you?

01:05:56.297 --> 01:05:59.877
Your father was a military pilot,
Armando, you hardly remember him.

01:06:00.047 --> 01:06:02.377
He died during a practice manoeuver.

01:06:10.255 --> 01:06:13.705
I don't know when the connection
between you and I broke

01:06:14.213 --> 01:06:17.923
to stop me from meeting David
and for him to stay with Ursula.

01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:23.550
Tell me how we supposedly met.

01:06:24.172 --> 01:06:25.762
<i>In 2001.</i>

01:06:26.338 --> 01:06:28.918
<i>One day after the New York attacks.</i>

01:06:29.088 --> 01:06:32.048
<i>We took the same train every morning.</i>

01:06:32.213 --> 01:06:34.713
<i>I nearly always sat in the same place.</i>

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:37.800
<i>Sometimes, like that morning,
you sat in front of me.</i>

01:06:38.588 --> 01:06:40.838
<i>When we reached Valpineda station...</i>

01:06:42.797 --> 01:06:45.587
- Are you OK? Are you hurt?
- No, no... I'm fine.

01:06:45.755 --> 01:06:49.375
<i>You stayed with me, we became friends
and started to hang around.</i>

01:06:50.422 --> 01:06:52.762
<i>One night we went to the cinema...</i>

01:06:52.922 --> 01:06:55.212
<i>You met David and introduced me.</i>

01:06:55.713 --> 01:06:56.713
- I'm Ursula
- Hi.

01:06:56.755 --> 01:06:59.045
<i>From the first time,
I knew it would be him.</i>

01:07:00.088 --> 01:07:01.798
What film did we see?

01:07:01.963 --> 01:07:03.593
We saw <i> Castaway.</i>

01:07:04.547 --> 01:07:07.337
I know you can't stand
seeing planes crash.

01:07:08.505 --> 01:07:10.125
You made an exception, for me.

01:07:10.297 --> 01:07:12.547
No, that's impossible.

01:07:13.838 --> 01:07:14.958
You liked me a lot.

01:07:15.755 --> 01:07:16.955
Did I?

01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:20.630
I liked you and let you go.

01:07:20.797 --> 01:07:22.547
It was love at first sight with David.

01:07:24.922 --> 01:07:25.962
Right...

01:07:27.297 --> 01:07:30.167
Well... that was a great story.

01:07:31.213 --> 01:07:33.093
It's a pity it didn't happen, so...

01:07:33.255 --> 01:07:34.665
It happened.

01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:37.630
Pleased to meet you.

01:07:49.838 --> 01:07:51.338
You were on the train.

01:07:52.463 --> 01:07:54.383
But you didn't sit in front of me.

01:07:55.422 --> 01:07:58.132
For some reason
you didn't sit in front of me.

01:07:58.297 --> 01:07:59.337
You should get help.

01:08:00.422 --> 01:08:01.842
I have to go.

01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:04.800
Wait, wait.

01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:07.380
What do you know about Nico Lasarte?

01:08:07.547 --> 01:08:09.587
Your neighbour, you studied together.

01:08:09.755 --> 01:08:11.875
What has Nico got to do with this?

01:08:12.047 --> 01:08:14.087
With Hilda Weiss.

01:08:16.837 --> 01:08:18.337
Angel's ex?

01:08:19.171 --> 01:08:20.841
Angel killed her.

01:08:21.171 --> 01:08:22.962
The boy saw it.

01:08:23.505 --> 01:08:25.255
He was run over.

01:08:25.421 --> 01:08:28.712
But I think I saved him,
and that changed everything.

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:32.550
I don't understand any of this, OK?

01:08:32.962 --> 01:08:36.343
But I know that Angel has been
with my mother for 20 years.

01:08:36.505 --> 01:08:39.255
He couldn't hurt a fly.
Much less Hilda Weiss.

01:08:39.421 --> 01:08:40.551
She left him.

01:08:40.630 --> 01:08:41.420
She didn't.

01:08:41.505 --> 01:08:43.915
She went with someone else
after the wall fell.

01:08:43.962 --> 01:08:45.383
It's not true.

01:08:45.755 --> 01:08:47.795
That's what he made you think.

01:08:48.130 --> 01:08:49.710
That man killed his wife.

01:08:49.796 --> 01:08:52.167
It's my mother's husband,
for God's sake!

01:08:52.255 --> 01:08:54.755
- Tell me about Nico Lasarte.
- Enough!

01:08:58.380 --> 01:08:59.630
I have to go.

01:09:06.130 --> 01:09:06.960
Here.

01:09:07.130 --> 01:09:09.550
- You OK, nephew?
- I'll tell you later.

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:11.630
<i>Today's guest is Karen Sardon,</i>

01:09:11.712 --> 01:09:15.053
<i>author of the novel Mirage,
published 2 decades ago.</i>

01:09:15.212 --> 01:09:18.553
<i>In the novel, she describes how
two symmetrical electrical storms</i>

01:09:18.671 --> 01:09:23.712
<i>occurred on November 9th, 1989,
and today.</i>

01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:26.590
<i>- Welcome, professor Sardon.
- Thank you.</i>

01:09:26.962 --> 01:09:29.633
<i>How could you know
this would happen?</i>

01:09:29.796 --> 01:09:33.756
<i>Can you see the future,
or does reality exceed the fiction?</i>

01:09:33.837 --> 01:09:36.298
<i>Well, like a magician
doesn't reveal his tricks,</i>

01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:40.170
<i>a writer shouldn't reveal
their inspiration.</i>

01:09:40.337 --> 01:09:42.917
<i>But to answer your question:
No, obviously.</i>

01:09:43.087 --> 01:09:45.207
<i>I can't see the future.</i>

01:09:45.337 --> 01:09:47.837
<i>My book is based on a story I was told,</i>

01:09:47.962 --> 01:09:50.053
<i>about a boy with schizophrenia,</i>

01:09:50.212 --> 01:09:53.212
<i>his hallucinations were so real</i>

01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:56.380
<i>that they inspired me
to write the novel.</i>

01:09:56.672 --> 01:09:58.672
<i>So this boy gave you the idea</i>

01:09:58.838 --> 01:10:01.168
<i>of the woman
who spoke through the television.</i>

01:10:01.338 --> 01:10:03.798
<i>Not exactly him. His mother.</i>

01:10:05.422 --> 01:10:08.262
<i>There is a lot of coincidence
in the story.</i>

01:10:09.838 --> 01:10:11.958
You left this at the hospital.

01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:13.880
What are you doing here?

01:10:14.047 --> 01:10:16.207
You were at David Ortiz's house.

01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:18.590
He told me he knows Aitor Medina.

01:10:18.755 --> 01:10:21.625
He's a pilot,
so I presumed you'd be here.

01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:40.960
TO NICO LASARTE

01:10:44.672 --> 01:10:47.172
Karen Sardon found this story
through Nico Lasarte.

01:10:47.338 --> 01:10:48.958
His mother told her about him.

01:10:49.172 --> 01:10:51.462
But the hallucination was real.

01:10:51.838 --> 01:10:52.918
It was me.

01:10:55.297 --> 01:10:59.547
Please, let me prove that I'm not crazy.

01:11:14.088 --> 01:11:17.668
<i>In fact, the mathematically
interesting Hilbert spaces</i>

01:11:17.797 --> 01:11:20.457
are vector spaces
of infinite dimension.

01:11:20.755 --> 01:11:23.755
The type of Hilbert space
necessary in each case

01:11:23.922 --> 01:11:25.762
depends on the system of...

01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:28.010
On nothing because class is over.

01:11:28.088 --> 01:11:30.208
For questions, you know where I am.

01:11:30.713 --> 01:11:35.553
For next week, read the theory
of the cosmic web, by Richard Gott.

01:11:37.505 --> 01:11:39.705
Maria Lasarte
came to see me because

01:11:39.797 --> 01:11:41.917
her son was convinced
his life was saved

01:11:42.088 --> 01:11:43.588
by a woman from the future

01:11:43.755 --> 01:11:45.955
who appeared on his television.

01:11:46.130 --> 01:11:49.210
What the woman wanted to know

01:11:49.297 --> 01:11:50.577
was whether the electrical storm

01:11:50.672 --> 01:11:53.382
could have created a time-space warp,

01:11:53.463 --> 01:11:55.843
something like a video call

01:11:55.963 --> 01:11:57.633
in symmetrical parallel time.

01:11:57.713 --> 01:11:59.053
What happened to the boy?

01:11:59.213 --> 01:12:01.173
I don't know, she didn't tell me.

01:12:01.338 --> 01:12:02.798
I was only interested

01:12:02.963 --> 01:12:05.883
in all the questions
that I could use in my book.

01:12:06.047 --> 01:12:07.457
Right, of course.

01:12:07.630 --> 01:12:09.630
You were only
interested in your book.

01:12:09.963 --> 01:12:10.963
No.

01:12:11.422 --> 01:12:13.262
I sent him to a specialist.

01:12:13.963 --> 01:12:17.423
If you didn't have contact
with him even then,

01:12:17.547 --> 01:12:19.957
- could you find him now?
- No, I couldn't.

01:12:20.130 --> 01:12:23.710
Your book is pure fabrication, right?

01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:26.340
Yes, pure fantasy.

01:12:26.463 --> 01:12:28.093
But it's happening.

01:12:29.130 --> 01:12:30.300
The storm.

01:12:31.338 --> 01:12:34.258
I'm here.
I remember Nico Lasarte.

01:12:34.922 --> 01:12:38.172
That doesn't prove that the woman
from the future wasn't just

01:12:38.338 --> 01:12:40.378
in Mar√≠a Lasarte's son's mind.

01:12:40.547 --> 01:12:43.337
Or that Nico Lasarte ever existed.

01:12:43.672 --> 01:12:46.762
He might have existed
only in the mother's mind.

01:12:46.922 --> 01:12:48.382
Like this book.

01:12:48.547 --> 01:12:51.377
It could be based
just on my imagination.

01:12:51.547 --> 01:12:52.957
But I exist.

01:12:53.213 --> 01:12:54.633
I exist.

01:12:54.963 --> 01:12:57.173
I told you my story.

01:12:57.338 --> 01:12:59.048
And these photos exist,

01:13:00.088 --> 01:13:01.588
they're proof of this.

01:13:01.922 --> 01:13:03.552
Nothing proves anything.

01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:07.883
We are the ones
who make sense of it.

01:13:08.088 --> 01:13:10.878
All we know is that the brain
truly believes

01:13:11.088 --> 01:13:12.798
the experiences that we feel.

01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:17.880
It's function is to interpret
a hallucination as if it were real.

01:13:18.713 --> 01:13:22.883
What do you think would happen
if reality were just an illusion?

01:13:23.838 --> 01:13:27.758
So, given that under
the same meteorological conditions,

01:13:27.922 --> 01:13:29.712
the connection would be possible,

01:13:30.422 --> 01:13:33.132
- how could we recover it?
- Why do you want to?

01:13:33.297 --> 01:13:34.707
Why?

01:13:35.713 --> 01:13:39.463
To get my life and my family back.
That's why.

01:13:39.963 --> 01:13:42.173
I don't know, but if it's possible,

01:13:42.922 --> 01:13:46.132
we would have to reproduce
the exact conditions

01:13:46.338 --> 01:13:50.668
that occurred at the time
of the first change.

01:13:51.088 --> 01:13:54.548
<i>In the same place,
with the same electrical connection.</i>

01:13:54.797 --> 01:13:56.127
Can I see your watch?

01:13:56.422 --> 01:14:00.172
The original television, the camera
and of course, during the storm.

01:14:02.255 --> 01:14:06.455
What if,
even with all of these elements,

01:14:06.630 --> 01:14:07.800
the storm ends?

01:14:09.672 --> 01:14:11.762
The bridge would close forever.

01:14:13.922 --> 01:14:16.212
The storm started 53 hours ago.

01:14:16.297 --> 01:14:19.957
If it's symmetrical to 1989,
it'll last 72.

01:14:21.963 --> 01:14:24.633
This is the time I have left
to find my daughter.

01:14:26.130 --> 01:14:27.510
Will you help me?

01:14:27.630 --> 01:14:28.880
How?

01:14:29.338 --> 01:14:31.958
I need the old television
and the camera.

01:14:32.588 --> 01:14:34.128
The Lasarte could have them.

01:14:34.297 --> 01:14:37.047
Searching police files can be very slow.

01:14:37.213 --> 01:14:40.803
I need judicial authorisation,
and I won't get it with this story.

01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:43.670
- I need more.
- Like what?

01:14:43.797 --> 01:14:45.507
Something convincing.

01:14:50.505 --> 01:14:52.955
<i>Here it says he owned an abattoir</i>

01:14:53.047 --> 01:14:55.587
and was going to bury his wife
underneath it.

01:14:55.755 --> 01:14:58.045
Who confesses something
he was going to do

01:14:58.213 --> 01:14:59.923
but didn't because he was arrested first?

01:15:00.088 --> 01:15:02.208
"VALPINEDA MURDERER"
TO BURY WIFE AT ABATTOIR

01:15:02.338 --> 01:15:04.128
I think I've got it.

01:16:01.422 --> 01:16:02.422
Coffee?

01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:12.260
There's something I don't understand.

01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:15.670
You still don't believe me, right?

01:16:16.213 --> 01:16:17.633
Look.

01:16:19.922 --> 01:16:21.462
This is your past life.

01:16:21.547 --> 01:16:25.127
This is 1989 and this is now.

01:16:25.297 --> 01:16:26.457
If what you say is true,

01:16:27.047 --> 01:16:31.297
if there's really a gate with
the past that allowed you to alter it,

01:16:31.838 --> 01:16:35.208
why are your memories still tied
to a time that really

01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:36.420
no longer took place?

01:16:43.338 --> 01:16:46.008
Aren't you curious to know
what your life is like now?

01:16:47.963 --> 01:16:49.463
But this is real.

01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:51.550
The body is real.

01:16:51.713 --> 01:16:54.173
It is also real
that you and I are here

01:16:54.338 --> 01:16:55.538
because you have another life.

01:16:55.630 --> 01:16:57.760
A very real other life.

01:16:57.922 --> 01:17:01.052
This one. With people
I'm sure care about you.

01:17:02.172 --> 01:17:04.132
I found the body.

01:17:05.797 --> 01:17:07.957
Now it's fair for you to help me.

01:17:09.630 --> 01:17:10.710
Inspector,

01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:12.420
the judge wants to talk to you.

01:17:14.047 --> 01:17:15.207
I'll be right back.

01:17:27.963 --> 01:17:29.463
<i>This body changes everything.</i>

01:17:30.672 --> 01:17:34.552
<i>The judge's priority is to identify it,
to be sure it is who you say it is.</i>

01:17:35.797 --> 01:17:39.167
Meanwhile, you are as suspicious
as the owner of the land.

01:17:39.797 --> 01:17:41.627
You don't have children, right?

01:17:43.463 --> 01:17:45.553
Someone who doesn't have children has time

01:17:46.172 --> 01:17:47.632
to do what they want.

01:17:48.838 --> 01:17:50.548
To be the best,

01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:53.710
but they also miss things.

01:17:55.463 --> 01:17:57.633
You asked for something convincing.

01:17:57.797 --> 01:18:01.207
Something real and I gave it to you.
What else?

01:18:13.422 --> 01:18:14.672
Stay here.

01:18:32.547 --> 01:18:34.957
All units, I've lost Vera Roy.

01:18:35.672 --> 01:18:37.712
I repeat, I have lost Vera Roy.

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:40.340
Report to me directly if she is found.

01:18:44.213 --> 01:18:46.423
My colleagues will back me up
before the judge.

01:18:47.672 --> 01:18:49.762
When you leave, you're on your own.

01:18:51.005 --> 01:18:53.705
I've made some calls
and revised credit cards.

01:18:55.713 --> 01:18:57.633
This is all I can offer you.

01:19:04.255 --> 01:19:06.455
BELMONTE HOTEL
ROOM 1016

01:19:06.630 --> 01:19:08.210
You found Nico Lasarte?

01:19:10.630 --> 01:19:12.380
I think this will bring you to him.

01:19:13.297 --> 01:19:15.007
Go before I change my mind.

01:19:32.005 --> 01:19:34.955
Happy birthday to you!

01:19:35.213 --> 01:19:39.593
Happy birthday to you!

01:19:39.755 --> 01:19:44.255
Happy birthday, dear Angel,

01:19:44.755 --> 01:19:48.955
happy birthday to you!

01:20:00.672 --> 01:20:02.842
- Oh...
- Blow harder!

01:20:07.547 --> 01:20:08.667
Well...

01:20:45.713 --> 01:20:47.763
David, where are you?

01:20:48.463 --> 01:20:50.013
Something is happening.

01:20:50.213 --> 01:20:51.673
<i>Something related with that woman...</i>

01:20:51.838 --> 01:20:54.298
<i>- The body appeared...</i>
- I know, I'm watching it.

01:20:56.505 --> 01:20:57.835
No, Aitor flew to Dubrovnik,

01:20:57.922 --> 01:20:59.712
he'll spend the night there.

01:20:59.963 --> 01:21:02.463
<i>...the neurosurgeon Vera Roy informed...</i>

01:21:02.630 --> 01:21:04.210
No, this is crazy.

01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:05.420
<i>...and then disappeared.</i>

01:21:05.505 --> 01:21:08.505
I'm at the office.
I'll be there in five minutes.

01:21:08.588 --> 01:21:10.798
<i>- No further information...</i>
- See you soon.

01:21:10.963 --> 01:21:14.553
<i>...on the victim's identity,
but unofficial sources ensure</i>

01:21:14.713 --> 01:21:16.633
<i>that it could be the former wife...</i>

01:21:32.213 --> 01:21:33.673
Who was it?

01:21:35.922 --> 01:21:37.962
It was Ursula, I have to go.

01:21:38.797 --> 01:21:40.207
What is it?

01:21:40.380 --> 01:21:43.010
It's not her, the family of a friend,
something happened.

01:21:50.797 --> 01:21:52.797
I have to go...

01:21:53.838 --> 01:21:55.758
Dinner.

01:21:55.922 --> 01:21:57.962
Don't escape.

01:22:18.797 --> 01:22:20.457
Dr. Roy?

01:22:20.630 --> 01:22:21.630
Monica?

01:22:22.672 --> 01:22:23.762
What are you doing here?

01:22:26.255 --> 01:22:28.005
They gave me this address

01:22:28.213 --> 01:22:30.463
and this room number.

01:22:31.130 --> 01:22:32.630
Can I come in?

01:22:32.797 --> 01:22:33.797
I'm not alone.

01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:35.380
I understand.

01:22:35.922 --> 01:22:37.172
Look...

01:22:37.338 --> 01:22:38.338
How can I help?

01:22:38.422 --> 01:22:41.382
I'm looking for someone
called Nico Lasarte.

01:22:41.963 --> 01:22:42.963
Do you know him?

01:22:43.130 --> 01:22:44.260
No.

01:22:45.172 --> 01:22:46.302
He's not here?

01:22:46.463 --> 01:22:47.963
No, I don't know that name.

01:22:48.005 --> 01:22:49.335
So who are you with?

01:22:49.505 --> 01:22:50.835
That's my business.

01:22:52.922 --> 01:22:54.212
Look, Dr. Roy.

01:22:54.380 --> 01:22:57.170
I don't know what's going on,
but we should call Dr. Fell.

01:22:58.005 --> 01:22:59.205
Where are you going?

01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:01.960
Dr. Roy, stop!

01:23:04.672 --> 01:23:07.132
I don't know who you're looking for,

01:23:07.213 --> 01:23:08.883
but I swear he's not here.

01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:24.630
David, I'm sorry.

01:23:24.797 --> 01:23:27.337
- I'll call the police.
- You're not calling anyone.

01:23:27.838 --> 01:23:29.048
Right?

01:23:31.755 --> 01:23:33.295
How long have you been together?

01:23:33.463 --> 01:23:35.013
We're not together.

01:23:35.088 --> 01:23:36.758
I'm not talking to you.

01:23:38.922 --> 01:23:40.712
Since my operation.

01:23:41.505 --> 01:23:43.505
It's not what you think, I love her.

01:23:44.213 --> 01:23:45.513
But you're with Ursula.

01:23:45.672 --> 01:23:47.212
That's totally different.

01:23:48.588 --> 01:23:50.838
Tell me what you want
and let's get this over with.

01:23:50.963 --> 01:23:52.053
Give me your hand.

01:23:56.505 --> 01:23:57.545
Give it here.

01:24:17.213 --> 01:24:18.963
I don't understand.

01:24:21.172 --> 01:24:25.922
If I only know you from the operation,
why don't I remember?

01:24:26.047 --> 01:24:27.047
What does it matter?

01:24:28.338 --> 01:24:30.958
But I remember
an entire life with you.

01:24:31.422 --> 01:24:35.052
And I remember every day
I was pregnant with Gloria.

01:24:37.713 --> 01:24:39.923
I know why I'm here.

01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:43.170
You'll bring me to Nico Lasarte.

01:24:43.255 --> 01:24:46.005
- I'll bring you to the police.
- Don't be a fool.

01:24:46.963 --> 01:24:48.593
You work in a bank.

01:24:48.838 --> 01:24:50.838
You have access to customers data.

01:24:50.963 --> 01:24:52.883
That is confidential.

01:24:53.047 --> 01:24:55.127
This is confidential too, I suppose.

01:25:05.047 --> 01:25:06.377
Good evening.

01:25:06.963 --> 01:25:08.173
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

01:25:09.505 --> 01:25:10.955
Do you remember me?

01:25:14.172 --> 01:25:16.342
Because I really remember you.

01:25:30.463 --> 01:25:31.633
Yes?

01:25:31.797 --> 01:25:33.337
<i>Inspector Dimas is here.</i>

01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:35.630
Thank you.

01:25:42.755 --> 01:25:44.415
<i>Let's start at the beginning.</i>

01:25:45.172 --> 01:25:49.842
<i>According to a police report
from 1989, on November 11th a boy,</i>

01:25:49.963 --> 01:25:54.303
<i>your neighbour, Nico Lasarte,
accused you of killing your wife.</i>

01:25:54.755 --> 01:25:55.875
Good evening.

01:25:56.005 --> 01:25:58.625
<i>Nobody believed him.
It was your word against his,</i>

01:25:58.797 --> 01:26:00.757
<i>and you could prove your version.</i>

01:26:01.588 --> 01:26:05.668
But what was a child's fantasy
is today a reality.

01:26:06.588 --> 01:26:09.758
The events are
from two days before, the ninth.

01:26:10.047 --> 01:26:12.507
The day the Wall fell
and the world changed.

01:26:24.297 --> 01:26:25.837
<i>According to your statement,</i>

01:26:25.922 --> 01:26:29.132
<i>that day your ex wife, Hilda Weiss,</i>

01:26:29.255 --> 01:26:32.545
<i>said she was going to visit
a friend in San Narciso.</i>

01:26:32.713 --> 01:26:35.013
<i>...the chance for Germans
from the East...</i>

01:26:35.213 --> 01:26:39.593
<i>According to the report, you declared
that your wife was preparing</i>

01:26:39.755 --> 01:26:42.255
<i>to return to Berlin.</i>

01:26:43.380 --> 01:26:45.380
<i>But I believe you lied.</i>

01:26:45.547 --> 01:26:48.257
<i>She never wanted
to go back to Germany.</i>

01:26:48.422 --> 01:26:51.632
<i>And you accepted
when she wanted to go visiting.</i>

01:26:54.713 --> 01:26:58.173
<i>You felt the decision
was going to create the occasion.</i>

01:27:01.172 --> 01:27:02.842
Something like that.

01:27:03.547 --> 01:27:04.797
Mum.

01:27:04.922 --> 01:27:06.012
Coming.

01:27:16.130 --> 01:27:17.340
Excuse me.

01:27:17.505 --> 01:27:18.795
You have a call.

01:27:20.963 --> 01:27:22.013
Hello.

01:27:22.213 --> 01:27:25.343
Honey, the road to San Narciso
is closed for the storm.

01:27:26.130 --> 01:27:28.380
<i>I have to spend the night here.</i>

01:27:28.547 --> 01:27:29.667
OK, don't worry.

01:27:29.838 --> 01:27:32.508
- See you tomorrow.
<i>- Goodbye.</i>

01:28:00.963 --> 01:28:01.963
Yes.

01:28:02.463 --> 01:28:04.013
She's not back until tomorrow.

01:28:05.213 --> 01:28:06.673
Clara,

01:28:07.630 --> 01:28:09.550
I promise to talk to her.

01:28:09.713 --> 01:28:11.963
<i>Things will change, OK?</i>

01:28:12.172 --> 01:28:13.512
Angel...

01:28:13.672 --> 01:28:15.512
<i>I love you.</i>

01:28:15.838 --> 01:28:17.048
I love you, too.

01:28:25.547 --> 01:28:27.007
Mr. Prieto.

01:28:27.755 --> 01:28:29.295
Tell me what happened that night.

01:28:32.380 --> 01:28:34.010
Did you kill your wife?

01:28:46.755 --> 01:28:47.585
What?

01:28:47.755 --> 01:28:48.795
My love!

01:28:50.463 --> 01:28:52.173
You scratched me...

01:30:06.797 --> 01:30:08.707
√Ångel.

01:30:10.922 --> 01:30:12.842
Son of a bitch.

01:30:12.963 --> 01:30:14.303
Hilda please!

01:30:15.588 --> 01:30:16.588
Hilda!

01:30:17.797 --> 01:30:19.797
Hilda!

01:30:19.963 --> 01:30:21.553
Clara, no!

01:30:39.755 --> 01:30:41.505
Stop it, Hilda!

01:30:43.505 --> 01:30:44.955
Hilda! No...

01:31:24.047 --> 01:31:26.207
Did you kill your wife?

01:31:30.130 --> 01:31:31.130
Yes or no?

01:31:35.005 --> 01:31:36.835
Answer, please.

01:31:40.213 --> 01:31:41.383
I want to speak to my lawyer.

01:31:42.505 --> 01:31:44.455
I have the right to remain silent.

01:31:51.547 --> 01:31:53.257
This is the watch Nico Lasarte

01:31:53.422 --> 01:31:54.632
found in your house.

01:31:54.797 --> 01:31:56.757
The proof you had an accomplice.

01:31:56.922 --> 01:32:00.382
Nico Lasarte highlighted
a detail about the watch.

01:32:00.505 --> 01:32:02.875
The details are important, Mr. Prieto.

01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:06.380
He noticed a small engraving.

01:32:07.213 --> 01:32:08.633
"CM."

01:32:08.797 --> 01:32:10.337
Can I see your watch?

01:32:10.505 --> 01:32:11.625
What?

01:32:11.797 --> 01:32:13.587
Your watch, please.

01:32:19.630 --> 01:32:20.960
Thank you.

01:32:27.422 --> 01:32:30.172
These are your current wife's initials.

01:32:30.797 --> 01:32:32.007
Clara Medina.

01:32:32.213 --> 01:32:33.803
The facts speak for themselves.

01:32:34.130 --> 01:32:37.340
Only she could act as Hilda,
to make her disappear.

01:32:38.130 --> 01:32:41.210
And I suspect that you helped.

01:32:49.047 --> 01:32:50.207
Will it work?

01:32:50.380 --> 01:32:52.340
The guy who makes them is good.

01:32:52.922 --> 01:32:56.762
Do what I said,
and don't make contact.

01:32:57.255 --> 01:33:00.545
These are assumptions, there's no proof.

01:33:00.630 --> 01:33:03.840
Nico Lasarte had the watch
implicating your neighbour,

01:33:03.922 --> 01:33:05.632
Clara Medina, and you knew.

01:33:05.838 --> 01:33:07.258
So you found a way

01:33:07.338 --> 01:33:10.668
to get it back at the boy's expense.

01:33:10.755 --> 01:33:12.545
We'll talk before you leave.

01:33:12.713 --> 01:33:13.923
<i>OK.</i>

01:33:14.047 --> 01:33:15.297
I love you.

01:33:15.463 --> 01:33:17.553
<i>I love you, too. A lot.</i>

01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:47.380
What is it?

01:34:52.213 --> 01:34:53.513
What is it?

01:34:54.922 --> 01:34:56.012
What is it?

01:35:21.755 --> 01:35:23.125
I have proof.

01:35:23.380 --> 01:35:25.170
Are you sure about it?

01:35:27.630 --> 01:35:30.210
We have checked
everything you've said.

01:35:30.380 --> 01:35:31.960
But we have a problem, kid.

01:35:32.047 --> 01:35:34.167
Your neighbour, Mr. Prieto,

01:35:34.255 --> 01:35:36.165
reported that someone broke in

01:35:36.338 --> 01:35:38.168
and stole a gold watch.

01:35:41.838 --> 01:35:43.798
He also says his wife left.

01:35:44.005 --> 01:35:47.335
She left him for an ex boyfriend
in Germany, her home.

01:35:47.505 --> 01:35:48.545
Nico made a mistake.

01:35:48.713 --> 01:35:50.593
But he would never make up
something he says

01:35:50.672 --> 01:35:53.212
he saw in Mr. Prieto's house
to cover himself.

01:35:53.380 --> 01:35:56.300
The problem is that
his wife's bank account

01:35:56.463 --> 01:35:58.383
shows movement in Berlin

01:35:58.547 --> 01:36:02.167
and we checked the list of passengers,
she flied there.

01:36:02.338 --> 01:36:04.668
There must be an explanation.
If my son...

01:36:04.838 --> 01:36:07.958
Your son, Ms. Lasarte,
has told an incredible story.

01:36:08.047 --> 01:36:12.047
About a woman from the future
who speaks through a television.

01:36:12.505 --> 01:36:15.455
That she gave him
the information about Angel Prieto.

01:36:18.422 --> 01:36:21.842
We have to find the way
to solve this misunderstanding.

01:36:22.088 --> 01:36:24.548
<i>I can only think of one option.</i>

01:36:24.713 --> 01:36:25.713
Relax.

01:36:29.588 --> 01:36:30.689
- Stop, Nico! Please!
- I saw it!

01:36:30.713 --> 01:36:32.593
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:36:40.463 --> 01:36:41.803
Is that my watch?

01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:45.840
Give Mr. Prieto back his watch.

01:36:47.422 --> 01:36:49.762
If you promise not to do this again,

01:36:49.922 --> 01:36:51.712
this will be our secret.

01:36:51.922 --> 01:36:54.342
We'll be at peace, OK?

01:37:04.380 --> 01:37:06.460
<i>They moved away after a while,</i>

01:37:06.547 --> 01:37:07.797
I didn't see him again.

01:37:08.588 --> 01:37:10.458
His mind wasn't right.

01:37:11.088 --> 01:37:12.708
That's the easy reading.

01:37:14.463 --> 01:37:17.633
Nico Lasarte made the mistake
of mixing what he knew

01:37:18.005 --> 01:37:20.585
with a story
about a woman from the future.

01:37:22.463 --> 01:37:24.093
That's why nobody believed him.

01:37:25.588 --> 01:37:26.838
We just need time

01:37:27.047 --> 01:37:29.797
for the forensics to prove
that the body we found

01:37:30.005 --> 01:37:31.455
is your ex wife.

01:37:32.630 --> 01:37:35.090
Nicol√°s Lasarte.

01:37:35.255 --> 01:37:36.665
Then, Nico Lasarte,

01:37:36.838 --> 01:37:38.758
will have won the battle.

01:37:38.922 --> 01:37:40.882
Over 20 years later,

01:37:41.047 --> 01:37:42.337
but he'll have won.

01:37:42.505 --> 01:37:44.755
He was our customer,
so was his mother

01:37:44.922 --> 01:37:46.592
and you say he lived in my house.

01:37:50.130 --> 01:37:54.800
Let's track his movements,
find his address...

01:37:56.088 --> 01:37:57.798
Here, this must be him.

01:37:58.005 --> 01:38:00.005
Nicol√°s Lasarte Leira.

01:38:01.380 --> 01:38:03.590
<i>The circle is closing, Mr. Prieto.</i>

01:38:03.713 --> 01:38:06.013
I'll tell you
what happened to Nico Lasarte.

01:38:06.088 --> 01:38:09.088
He got obsessed
with proving he was right.

01:38:09.255 --> 01:38:10.505
All he had to do

01:38:10.672 --> 01:38:13.512
was to wait for the woman
from the future to come back.

01:38:21.505 --> 01:38:24.005
<i>He calculated the hours
left in the storm,</i>

01:38:24.088 --> 01:38:26.878
<i>guessing that when it ended
the gate would close.</i>

01:38:29.172 --> 01:38:30.342
<i>That's what happened.</i>

01:38:33.505 --> 01:38:36.505
<i>Something in the future
had stopped any new communication.</i>

01:38:38.338 --> 01:38:39.838
<i>He only had questions,</i>

01:38:42.005 --> 01:38:44.045
<i>and his mother only wanted answers.</i>

01:38:47.338 --> 01:38:50.418
<i>Tests proved
that he wasn't consciously lying.</i>

01:38:54.505 --> 01:38:56.455
<i>So the reason
for his obsession had to be</i>

01:38:56.630 --> 01:38:59.300
a mental disorder.

01:39:01.338 --> 01:39:03.588
<i>His mother decided to get away,</i>

01:39:03.755 --> 01:39:06.835
<i>with the hope that
some day he would be cured.</i>

01:39:10.422 --> 01:39:13.842
<i>But it was just the beginning
of a long nightmare.</i>

01:39:19.505 --> 01:39:21.005
<i>First the psychologists,</i>

01:39:21.505 --> 01:39:23.045
<i>then psychiatrists.</i>

01:39:23.755 --> 01:39:25.915
<i>Then admission to a centre</i>

01:39:26.547 --> 01:39:28.917
<i>until he surrendered to their ideas.</i>

01:39:31.130 --> 01:39:32.880
<i>But not to himself.</i>

01:39:33.838 --> 01:39:37.208
<i>He denied the existence of Vera Roy
so they would stop.</i>

01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:41.170
<i>But Nico Lasarte knew
you were guilty.</i>

01:39:41.630 --> 01:39:44.340
<i>And he never understood why
the woman who saved him once</i>

01:39:44.505 --> 01:39:46.625
<i>didn't come back to help him.</i>

01:39:46.797 --> 01:39:49.257
<i>So Nico Lasarte
never forgot Vera Roy.</i>

01:39:49.422 --> 01:39:51.012
The top floor.

01:39:51.172 --> 01:39:53.302
His post has been
sent here for 5 years.

01:40:00.213 --> 01:40:01.513
Are we even?

01:40:05.547 --> 01:40:08.797
<i>At the time, he didn't know her name,
but he had a clue.</i>

01:40:15.547 --> 01:40:16.627
<i>So he followed it.</i>

01:40:20.338 --> 01:40:21.798
<i>And he waited.</i>

01:40:57.380 --> 01:41:02.920
<i>His future and past
came together in that moment</i>

01:41:03.172 --> 01:41:04.882
<i>and he was frightened.</i>

01:41:08.088 --> 01:41:11.378
<i>Everything that had made him
crazy to others,</i>

01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:14.710
<i>was becoming a reality
in front of his eyes.</i>

01:41:17.755 --> 01:41:19.915
<i>He didn't know how to reach her,</i>

01:41:20.130 --> 01:41:21.460
<i>what could he say?</i>

01:41:21.630 --> 01:41:25.420
<i>How could she believe him
when she hadn't experienced it yet?</i>

01:41:42.380 --> 01:41:44.460
<i>He stopped looking for answers</i>

01:41:45.088 --> 01:41:48.588
<i>and wished that she would never
look for them, either.</i>

01:41:50.422 --> 01:41:53.462
<i>The flight of a butterfly
can be very cruel</i>

01:41:53.630 --> 01:41:58.010
<i>if it occurs in a place
and a time that allows for change.</i>

01:41:58.172 --> 01:41:59.422
I was waiting for you.

01:42:02.380 --> 01:42:03.380
- Sorry.
- Are you OK?

01:42:03.630 --> 01:42:06.090
Yes. I'm fine.

01:42:06.255 --> 01:42:07.255
Let me help.

01:42:10.505 --> 01:42:13.585
My name is Nicol√°s Lasarte Leira,
Mr. Prieto.

01:42:15.172 --> 01:42:17.422
We live in a system that is chaotic,

01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:20.340
and drastically alterable.

01:42:36.630 --> 01:42:39.460
Nico asked me to come
in case this happened.

01:42:39.630 --> 01:42:41.170
To help you remember.

01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:43.420
To remember what?

01:42:43.588 --> 01:42:46.048
It's best
if you discover it for yourself.

01:44:03.547 --> 01:44:04.757
Where is she?

01:44:12.047 --> 01:44:13.837
Go home, Mum.

01:44:26.005 --> 01:44:27.335
I'm sorry.

01:44:30.713 --> 01:44:32.803
I've been stuck for two days.

01:44:36.463 --> 01:44:40.343
Since you came to the station
and you didn't recognize me,

01:44:42.088 --> 01:44:46.048
talking about that life you had
when I was a boy.

01:44:50.755 --> 01:44:52.795
It wasn't the life you had with me.

01:44:53.588 --> 01:44:57.008
It wasn't possible that you lived it
because I changed it.

01:44:57.463 --> 01:44:58.923
By finding you.

01:45:00.422 --> 01:45:02.512
But you had those memories.

01:45:06.630 --> 01:45:08.510
And you had erased me.

01:45:09.713 --> 01:45:13.213
I let Dr. Fell interpret
what was happening in his way,

01:45:14.255 --> 01:45:15.835
and I waited.

01:45:17.047 --> 01:45:19.167
With the hope that you'd remember.

01:45:21.630 --> 01:45:23.510
Remember us, Vera.

01:45:25.505 --> 01:45:27.585
I just wanted to understand

01:45:28.338 --> 01:45:30.298
my experiences as a boy and...

01:45:31.547 --> 01:45:33.707
why you hadn't come back.

01:45:35.672 --> 01:45:39.512
I couldn't know that when you were
to meet Aitor, you'd meet me,

01:45:39.672 --> 01:45:41.512
and everything would change.

01:45:44.338 --> 01:45:47.088
I avoided you finding me,

01:45:47.255 --> 01:45:49.455
because I didn't want
things to change again.

01:45:49.880 --> 01:45:51.340
Because I love you,

01:45:51.588 --> 01:45:53.338
and I don't want to lose you.

01:45:59.172 --> 01:46:01.842
I have feared this moment for years.

01:46:02.005 --> 01:46:06.205
I feared the day you would find
our connection in our present.

01:46:06.380 --> 01:46:08.010
I imagined it all.

01:46:08.172 --> 01:46:10.382
All of the possibilities.

01:46:12.630 --> 01:46:15.170
But not that you would
forget me overnight.

01:46:16.672 --> 01:46:19.422
That you would go back
to a life you haven't lived.

01:46:19.838 --> 01:46:21.708
Because I changed it.

01:46:24.422 --> 01:46:26.882
Then the storm arrived.

01:46:32.588 --> 01:46:34.798
I need the camera

01:46:36.297 --> 01:46:38.007
and the television.

01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:43.380
I don't remember any of this.

01:46:48.005 --> 01:46:49.335
I dumped all of it.

01:46:50.338 --> 01:46:51.588
No.

01:46:53.005 --> 01:46:56.705
Someone broke into David's house.

01:46:56.797 --> 01:46:58.167
You broke in.

01:46:58.338 --> 01:46:59.418
<i>It was you.</i>

01:46:59.547 --> 01:47:00.957
To test the connection.

01:47:01.130 --> 01:47:02.380
You wanted to know.

01:47:03.422 --> 01:47:05.592
<i>I would have too.</i>

01:47:07.297 --> 01:47:08.297
Hello?

01:47:08.380 --> 01:47:10.090
<i>Yes, I tried it.</i>

01:47:11.005 --> 01:47:13.505
But I realised it was a mistake
and disconnected.

01:47:14.713 --> 01:47:17.633
I couldn't risk a new connection
altering my past

01:47:17.797 --> 01:47:20.007
and everything I did to meet you.

01:47:23.088 --> 01:47:25.258
But I let you find me.

01:47:26.505 --> 01:47:29.505
To see who David Ortiz really is,

01:47:30.422 --> 01:47:32.012
and to find me.

01:47:33.922 --> 01:47:39.422
You have to go back to 1989
and grow up

01:47:39.588 --> 01:47:42.048
without an obsession with me.

01:47:44.838 --> 01:47:49.168
You have to forget me
so that you never have to find me.

01:47:49.922 --> 01:47:52.632
And you have to forget
Angel Prieto, too.

01:47:53.255 --> 01:47:56.335
If they find him in the past
that would affect Clara,

01:47:56.880 --> 01:48:00.090
that would affect Aitor,
and I need to meet him,

01:48:00.255 --> 01:48:02.545
like I would have
if you hadn't stopped it

01:48:02.713 --> 01:48:06.803
that's the only way to meet David
and to get my daughter back.

01:48:07.880 --> 01:48:10.090
What if it doesn't work out?

01:48:12.088 --> 01:48:14.418
We can't control
everything that might happen.

01:48:15.047 --> 01:48:16.957
- I'll take the risk.
- No.

01:48:23.505 --> 01:48:25.335
Let me be your memory.

01:48:27.297 --> 01:48:28.757
Please.

01:48:30.338 --> 01:48:31.338
Please.

01:48:32.005 --> 01:48:33.335
Stay with me.

01:49:26.505 --> 01:49:28.415
Do you remember me now?

01:49:35.672 --> 01:49:37.632
This is real.

01:49:39.422 --> 01:49:41.012
This is real.

01:49:43.630 --> 01:49:48.760
We have to go back to 1989.

01:49:50.588 --> 01:49:52.508
No. No.

01:49:58.838 --> 01:50:00.418
I can't.

01:50:03.547 --> 01:50:05.257
No, I'm sorry.

01:50:35.838 --> 01:50:37.008
What are you doing?

01:50:38.588 --> 01:50:40.668
I saved you.

01:50:42.422 --> 01:50:43.922
Now it's your turn.

01:53:02.255 --> 01:53:03.545
Hello?

01:53:03.713 --> 01:53:04.803
<i>Hello, Nico.</i>

01:53:05.005 --> 01:53:06.085
Who are you?

01:53:06.255 --> 01:53:07.875
<i>Listen to me.</i>

01:53:08.922 --> 01:53:10.592
<i>I'm you.</i>

01:53:10.755 --> 01:53:12.005
<i>You're me.</i>

01:53:13.755 --> 01:53:15.585
Where's the woman from the future?

01:53:19.922 --> 01:53:21.512
<i>You have to help me.</i>

01:53:22.672 --> 01:53:24.172
<i>Please.</i>

01:53:24.672 --> 01:53:27.552
<i>What I'm going to tell you is very...</i>

01:53:28.297 --> 01:53:30.047
<i>very important.</i>

01:56:10.672 --> 01:56:11.882
Mum.

01:56:14.755 --> 01:56:17.585
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

01:56:18.047 --> 01:56:19.417
Are you sad?

01:56:19.505 --> 01:56:21.295
No, I'm very happy.

01:56:23.880 --> 01:56:25.010
Hey...

01:56:28.380 --> 01:56:30.130
This isn't a dream, right?

01:56:32.213 --> 01:56:33.383
What, Mum?

01:56:41.297 --> 01:56:43.457
I don't want you to move from here.

01:57:03.297 --> 01:57:05.207
Vera, love, are you OK?

01:57:09.047 --> 01:57:10.957
What is it, are you alright?

01:57:13.547 --> 01:57:15.547
I had a nightmare.

01:57:15.713 --> 01:57:17.423
Another one?

01:57:21.463 --> 01:57:22.763
What do you mean, another?

01:57:23.297 --> 01:57:25.877
Vera, you've been acting strange
for a few days.

01:57:29.463 --> 01:57:30.763
Where...?

01:57:31.255 --> 01:57:33.375
Where are the camera

01:57:33.588 --> 01:57:36.128
and the television
that were in there?

01:57:36.297 --> 01:57:39.547
There has never been a camera
in there, or a television...

01:57:39.713 --> 01:57:41.463
Are you really alright?

01:57:50.255 --> 01:57:51.255
Vera.

01:57:52.505 --> 01:57:54.205
Where are you going?

01:57:54.463 --> 01:57:56.263
What's going on?

01:58:02.005 --> 01:58:03.625
Vera, you're frightening me.

01:58:18.963 --> 01:58:20.513
Where did you get the matches?

01:58:21.588 --> 01:58:23.008
Here we go again.

01:58:23.088 --> 01:58:25.458
From the hotel in Seville,
don't you remember?

01:58:41.297 --> 01:58:43.207
It really happened.

01:58:45.213 --> 01:58:46.923
Angel is free.

01:58:49.588 --> 01:58:51.168
He kept his promise.

01:58:53.338 --> 01:58:54.458
Vera.

02:00:18.672 --> 02:00:20.212
OK, received.

02:00:22.713 --> 02:00:24.263
Would you like a coffee?

02:00:27.255 --> 02:00:28.415
Thank you.

02:00:33.422 --> 02:00:34.962
<i>The inspector is here.</i>

02:00:37.005 --> 02:00:38.085
Got it.

02:00:49.255 --> 02:00:50.335
Sir.

02:00:51.672 --> 02:00:54.132
A woman found a body.
She hasn't said anything,

02:00:54.297 --> 02:00:57.297
just that it's the ex wife
of the abattoir's owner.

02:00:57.463 --> 02:01:00.173
But according to our reports,
she lives in Berlin.

02:01:00.755 --> 02:01:02.665
- Who is it?
- Her.

02:01:10.213 --> 02:01:12.383
I want to know
how you found the body,

02:01:12.547 --> 02:01:15.087
and why you think
it's Hilda Weiss.

02:01:31.380 --> 02:01:34.710
I knew it would be you, Nico.

02:01:38.297 --> 02:01:39.757
Do I know you?

02:01:40.713 --> 02:01:42.013
Yes.

02:01:44.838 --> 02:01:47.508
You just don't remember yet.
