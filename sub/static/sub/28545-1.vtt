When I saw you I...

01:33.051 --> 01:34.612
[boyfriend] I knew it was the real deal.

01:34.636 --> 01:36.846
No one ever fell in love
and said that it was easy.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.270
[boy and girlfriend laughing]

01:38.849 --> 01:41.229
So you're planning on staying together?

01:41.393 --> 01:43.063
Well, we know it will be a challenge,

01:43.145 --> 01:45.435
'cause our colleges are eight hours apart.

01:45.814 --> 01:47.524
And neither of us have a car.

01:47.858 --> 01:50.418
[girlfriend] But we have this rule.
We say goodnight every night.

01:50.777 --> 01:52.057
[girlfriend] We'll make it work.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.622
- [boyfriend] For sure, we will.
- Plus, we have these.

01:55.741 --> 01:56.831
Promise rings.

01:57.367 --> 02:00.157
So it's totally, like, a promise.

02:00.871 --> 02:01.871
Right.

02:02.372 --> 02:03.462
Of course.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.460
Check this out, man.

02:07.377 --> 02:08.377
What's this?

02:11.048 --> 02:12.468
A summer wishlist?

02:12.841 --> 02:14.381
Have you even been watching the news?

02:14.801 --> 02:15.801
How dare you?

02:16.094 --> 02:17.264
This is strictly consensual.

02:17.512 --> 02:18.512
[scoffs]

02:18.555 --> 02:20.305
You have a point system.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.024
I assume this ranks by personality.

02:22.351 --> 02:24.021
Obviously. I'm not an animal.

02:24.102 --> 02:25.482
That accounts for a bonus point.

02:27.856 --> 02:28.856
Gisele?

02:29.232 --> 02:31.072
Tom Brady might have
something to say about it.

02:31.109 --> 02:34.069
She represents cougar.

02:35.447 --> 02:37.067
Doesn't have to be her specifically.

02:37.199 --> 02:38.949
So she's representative?

02:39.034 --> 02:40.034
Okay.

02:40.118 --> 02:41.698
Maybe you should just narrow this down

02:41.787 --> 02:43.467
to who might be willing
and see who's left.

02:43.497 --> 02:44.327
All right.

02:52.172 --> 02:55.052
[Audrey] I mean, seriously.
Do you know how insulting it is

02:55.133 --> 02:56.893
to get waitlisted at your backup school?

02:57.219 --> 02:59.759
It's like the biggest weirdo in school,

03:00.430 --> 03:01.810
that guy who wears a cape,

03:02.474 --> 03:05.394
saying he's not sure
if he wants you to blow him.

03:05.477 --> 03:07.397
And you're like,
"Dude, you wear a fucking cape!"

03:08.605 --> 03:11.015
[Audrey] Well, maybe
the whole personal assistant thing

03:11.108 --> 03:12.568
could be a career path.

03:12.818 --> 03:14.318
But she has a kid.

03:14.403 --> 03:15.783
And I hate kids.

03:16.655 --> 03:17.655
[groan]

03:18.115 --> 03:19.115
I give up!

03:20.909 --> 03:23.119
I mean... what are you supposed
to wear to a breakup?

03:24.121 --> 03:26.371
[Mom] So, Helen opens Luke's diploma,

03:26.790 --> 03:29.290
and it is empty!

03:29.668 --> 03:30.538
[Dad] No shock there.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.627
[Dad] Not a lot of discipline
in that Ramsey House.

03:33.338 --> 03:34.658
Didn't they have all the parties?

03:34.715 --> 03:37.465
[Sierra] Yeah! A kid got
his stomach pumped there last year.

03:37.926 --> 03:38.796
How do you know that?

03:38.885 --> 03:40.645
[Sierra] It was from
the ginormous beer bong.

03:40.679 --> 03:41.559
[cell buzzing]

03:41.638 --> 03:44.118
- [Sierra] Paige Wilcox posted it.
- [Dad] Who is Paige Wilcox?

03:44.683 --> 03:45.523
[cell buzzing]

- [Reece] I can't find it.
- [Chad] Find what?

03:55.569 --> 03:57.569
Big party. Warehouse district.

03:57.696 --> 03:59.866
I can't believe I can't hack the address.

03:59.948 --> 04:02.778
Right. 'Cause they lost the invitations.

04:03.285 --> 04:05.285
Grad week. People really cut loose.

04:05.370 --> 04:06.580
We could have hooked up.

04:06.663 --> 04:07.583
[sighs]

04:07.664 --> 04:09.174
That's a negative.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.330
It's a tale as old as time.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.730
The hot girls will hook up,
because they've always been hot

04:13.754 --> 04:15.554
and dated the guys
who gave them experience...

04:15.630 --> 04:17.024
- But not with us?
- [Chad] Correct.

04:17.048 --> 04:19.447
And the average girls,
the ones we actually have a shot with,

04:19.509 --> 04:21.654
well, they won't hook up,
because they lack experience.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.218
The ultimate zero-sum algorithm.

04:23.555 --> 04:24.715
Any luck with the fake IDs?

04:24.806 --> 04:27.676
Six hundred dollar PayPal to China.
Nothing.

04:28.143 --> 04:29.733
Can you trust no one these days?

04:31.605 --> 04:32.935
When did it happen, Reece?

04:34.316 --> 04:36.436
When exactly were we designated uncool?

04:36.693 --> 04:37.613
Freshman year.

04:37.694 --> 04:40.014
You got caught reading <i>Harry Potter</i>
at the homecoming game.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.570
It was <i>Deathly Hollows.</i>

04:41.990 --> 04:43.660
I stand by my choice.

04:44.117 --> 04:47.037
Anyway. I bet
that party tonight is totally lame.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.750
- [Bro] Yeah!
- [crowd shouting]

04:48.872 --> 04:51.002

05:23.240 --> 05:24.660
Welcome back, man!

05:24.741 --> 05:25.951
What up, man?

05:26.034 --> 05:27.084
Looking good!

05:27.160 --> 05:27.990
Yeah, you too!

05:28.078 --> 05:30.158
- Little sober, but I can remedy.
- Yeah, for sure.

05:31.206 --> 05:32.076

05:32.165 --> 05:34.285
[Mason] Look like you still hurtin'
for that one, huh?

05:34.417 --> 05:35.747
- No, I...
- Yeah!

05:36.294 --> 05:39.014
I hear she's interviewing people
for this documentary.

05:39.631 --> 05:42.011
- You should definitely volunteer, bro.
- [scoffs]

05:42.175 --> 05:44.175
- I'm okay.
- No, seriously!

05:44.261 --> 05:45.601
I hear she's going to USC.

05:46.555 --> 05:48.555
Documentary's supposed to be about a...

05:51.560 --> 05:53.560
A real thinker piece.

05:54.229 --> 05:55.559
Yeah. [laughs]

05:55.772 --> 05:56.862
Real informative.

06:07.075 --> 06:08.115
[cell beeping]

06:09.536 --> 06:11.996
[Alex] It's so loud.
Back here should be good.

06:12.122 --> 06:13.582
[Erin] Yeah, good idea.

06:13.999 --> 06:15.789
[laughs nervously] Oops!

06:18.795 --> 06:21.165
- [inhales] Um...
- [chuckles]

06:21.256 --> 06:24.126
So I was thinking about what you said
and um...

06:24.885 --> 06:27.965
about how many try to stay together
going to different colleges. It's just...

06:28.388 --> 06:29.678
So high school.

06:29.764 --> 06:32.144
Right. The whole idea
of waiting until August...

06:32.225 --> 06:33.845
A slow death march. [laughs]

06:36.646 --> 06:39.686
S-So, should we talk
about how this will work?

06:40.108 --> 06:41.108
I mean...

06:41.735 --> 06:42.985
Do we still talk?

06:43.069 --> 06:45.569
Maybe not. You know, I just mean...

06:45.655 --> 06:47.735
If we're really gonna do this.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.584
Yeah, I agree.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.753
- No talking.
- I guess, um...

06:52.078 --> 06:53.078
maybe we could text?

06:53.246 --> 06:54.746
Occasional texts. Okay.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.461
- That-That's nice.
- Yes.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.417
Um...

06:59.753 --> 07:01.803
What if one of us starts seeing someone?

07:03.548 --> 07:05.401
- [chuckles]
- I don't have anyone in mind. I...

07:05.425 --> 07:09.885
Alec, I just think we respected each other
when we were together, so

07:09.971 --> 07:12.521
we should respect each other
when we're apart.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.733
- I mean, we've been together two years.
- Mmm.

07:16.353 --> 07:17.353
Well...

07:18.396 --> 07:19.396
have a great summer.

07:19.481 --> 07:20.481
Thanks.

07:21.149 --> 07:22.149
You too.

07:23.818 --> 07:25.818

07:33.495 --> 07:34.995
Doing the right thing, guys.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.251

I'm proud of you both.

07:39.626 --> 07:40.626
Thank you, Mason.

07:52.597 --> 07:53.717

- Yeah.

07:54.766 --> 07:56.096
[laughs] For sure.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.519
Hey, Juicebox.

07:58.061 --> 08:00.021
- Uh, no.
- So, I'm Foster.

08:00.146 --> 08:02.146
- And I just wanted to say...
- No, means no!

08:02.273 --> 08:03.443
Foster.

08:05.694 --> 08:06.744
All right. [laughs]

08:08.863 --> 08:09.913
How you doin'?

08:18.915 --> 08:20.915
[laughs]

08:21.292 --> 08:22.712
Paige Wilcox.

08:23.128 --> 08:24.708
She checks all the right boxes.

08:25.380 --> 08:27.380
- Is she on your list?
- Didn't even bother.

08:27.924 --> 08:28.934
I'm not worthy.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.259
[sparkling bells]

08:38.643 --> 08:41.313
- Hey, stranger.
- Hey, how are you?

08:41.395 --> 08:43.226
Good. I heard about you and Erin.

08:43.313 --> 08:44.944
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm Foster.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.395
Mm-hmm. Um...

08:47.027 --> 08:48.027
[Paige] Do you...

08:48.820 --> 08:49.820
Do you wanna hang out?

08:50.155 --> 08:52.445
I... Yeah. Sure.

08:52.532 --> 08:53.742
- [Alec] Um...
- Now?

08:54.034 --> 08:55.914
Can I just pretend I went to college

08:55.994 --> 08:57.794
and then backpack around Europe instead?

08:58.663 --> 09:00.963
Do people really fact-check resumes?

09:01.416 --> 09:03.206
I feel like that's very time-intensive.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.126
You don't really want to do that.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.378
I'm not saying
I'm gonna put an Ivy League.

09:07.756 --> 09:10.676
Although I could put Harvard
and just test the waters.

09:10.842 --> 09:12.922
I feel like it's easy to pretend
you went to Harvard.

09:12.969 --> 09:14.889
You just have to bring it up a lot.

09:15.346 --> 09:16.346
[Alec] Oh! Look out!

09:16.806 --> 09:19.096
[laughs]

09:19.976 --> 09:21.056
[laugh] Sorry!

09:21.144 --> 09:23.247
- [Alex] Bring it back in there.
- [Paige] It's hard. I drink beer,

09:23.271 --> 09:24.457
- [Paige] I don't play with it.
- [laughs]

09:24.481 --> 09:25.731
[Erin] That was quick!

09:25.815 --> 09:26.935
[laughs]

09:27.025 --> 09:28.065
[sighs]

09:28.193 --> 09:29.283
- Come on.
- [scoffs]

09:30.028 --> 09:31.028
Fishnets?

09:37.577 --> 09:38.577
Wait, you're...

09:39.162 --> 09:40.162
Griffin.

09:40.330 --> 09:41.750
Right. How are you?

09:41.831 --> 09:42.831
Great.

09:44.334 --> 09:45.334
Normal.

09:45.919 --> 09:46.919
Actually, I...

09:47.003 --> 09:48.343
[Mason] Whoa! Too thirsty, bro.

09:49.380 --> 09:50.880
He's great, Phoebe. [laughs]

09:51.257 --> 09:53.547
You know, we were actually
just catching up.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.927
You know, Griffin here, he definitely
wants to be interviewed.

09:57.013 --> 09:57.893
Oh, really?

09:57.972 --> 09:59.283
- [Mason] Yeah!
- [Griffin] Mm-mm.

09:59.307 --> 10:00.767
No. I don't remember saying that.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.119
[Phoebe] No, that would be great.

10:02.143 --> 10:04.653
Have a different perspective.
You left for high school, right?

10:04.896 --> 10:07.146
- Yes, he did.
- Yeah, I did.

10:07.816 --> 10:09.436
Cool, we'll reach out. When you're free.

10:09.526 --> 10:11.106
- It's Phoebe...
- Fisher.

10:12.195 --> 10:14.195
Right. Thanks.

- Blow me.

10:19.035 --> 10:20.035
[laughs]

10:20.120 --> 10:23.000
[Lilah's mom] So the woman at the agency
said you have a car,

10:23.665 --> 10:27.785
which is important because I'll need you
to drive Lilah to and from auditions.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.134
Auditions?

10:29.212 --> 10:31.972
Well, Lilah has been modeling and acting
for some time now.

10:32.257 --> 10:35.047
You know what they say,
the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

10:35.844 --> 10:37.474
I was a child actor when I was younger.

10:37.679 --> 10:39.679
Bit of theater, commercial work,

10:39.806 --> 10:41.806
and I was in a pretty well-known movie.

10:42.725 --> 10:44.385
<i>Sixteen Candles.</i>

10:45.478 --> 10:47.358
Wow, that's... cool.

10:47.647 --> 10:48.647
Lilah,

10:49.190 --> 10:52.070
this is Audrey. She's gonna
be helping us out this summer.

10:52.235 --> 10:53.235
Hm.

10:53.278 --> 10:55.028
I'll let you two get to know each other.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.161
So...

11:07.375 --> 11:09.785
So your mom tells me
you're quite the actress.

11:09.961 --> 11:11.421
It's a challenging endeavor.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.304
I'm just trying to hone my craft.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.298
Ooo. [sighs]

11:20.930 --> 11:22.570
So who's the next lucky lady on the list?

11:24.767 --> 11:25.847
[sighs]

11:29.272 --> 11:30.822
- Christine Purdy?
- [Foster] Mm-hmm.

11:30.940 --> 11:32.650
You planning to attend Bible study now?

11:32.734 --> 11:34.154
She's probably a virgin.

11:35.278 --> 11:36.648
It would be my honor.

11:36.863 --> 11:37.863
[laughs]

11:38.406 --> 11:39.646
- [tire squealing]
- [Alec] Woe!

11:39.699 --> 11:40.699
[Foster] Oh!

11:40.950 --> 11:41.950
Hey!

11:41.993 --> 11:43.493

11:43.703 --> 11:44.753
Oh, man, this is...

11:45.288 --> 11:46.288
this is amazing.

11:46.664 --> 11:48.674
Right? I mean, it was this or double D's,

11:48.750 --> 11:51.070
but I think I made the right choice.
My boobs already rock.

11:51.878 --> 11:54.048
Oh! Beach bonfire party. Are you down?

11:54.672 --> 11:56.722
I... sure. Yeah.

11:56.925 --> 11:58.715
Okay. I will text you the info.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.182
And I will see you tonight.

12:32.961 --> 12:34.421

during your college experience.

utterly unremarkable.

12:54.732 --> 12:55.732
You did great.

12:56.317 --> 12:58.397
[whispering] You should have seen
some of the others.

13:00.530 --> 13:02.070
Ah, nice setup.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.122
Yeah.

13:03.199 --> 13:06.409
[Phoebe] One of my teachers knows
the guy who owns the studio.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.583
[Phoebe] And I could do a lot of it
on my laptop, but

13:14.294 --> 13:17.884

some of the techy stuff. [sighs]

13:26.681 --> 13:28.201
[Griffin] So you have automation here.

13:28.725 --> 13:30.845

about everyone else,

13:36.190 --> 13:38.070

since I was a kid.

13:40.236 --> 13:41.446

13:43.406 --> 13:45.236

your film for SC, right?

- No. NYU.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.999
NYU of New York. Yes.

13:55.626 --> 13:58.626
Um... I'm not doing it for them.
It's for a festival this summer.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.194
- It's okay.
- You prefer directors?

14:16.272 --> 14:17.442
- I do.
- Okay.

I may run into Alicia Keys,

14:48.638 --> 14:49.638
Jake Gyllenhaal.

14:50.848 --> 14:52.848
Yeah, no big deal.
And then maybe grab a beer with

[laughs]

21:57.274 --> 22:00.244
- [sighs] Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine. [chuckles]

22:00.611 --> 22:01.611
I'm really sorry.

22:01.695 --> 22:04.775
I'd wanna take care of the mustard but
I'm kind of in the middle of something.

22:04.824 --> 22:05.954
Yes, go do you.

22:06.033 --> 22:07.033
All right.

22:07.284 --> 22:08.284
[Santos] Hey!

22:08.327 --> 22:10.327
[cheers]

22:13.082 --> 22:15.632
I wasn't enjoying
that hot dog or anything.

22:28.806 --> 22:30.596

22:31.642 --> 22:33.312
Thanks. [chuckles]

22:35.271 --> 22:37.441
[Audrey] Oh, my God, Erin.

22:37.606 --> 22:39.835
If you weren't my best friend,
we could never be friends.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.859
You literally have dates
falling out of the sky.

22:41.944 --> 22:43.824
Come on. I'm not actually
gonna go out with him.

22:43.988 --> 22:45.568
Yeah, no. He's young,

22:45.739 --> 22:47.489
he's successful, and he's hot.

22:47.825 --> 22:48.905
Gross!

22:48.993 --> 22:50.833
Give me that, I'll make sure
it's disposed of.

[cheers]

22:54.081 --> 22:55.081

22:55.624 --> 22:56.674
- Enjoy it.
- Thanks, dude.

22:56.750 --> 22:58.470
[Griffin] We're all on this fret
right here.

22:58.794 --> 23:00.897
[Griffin] You want your index finger
on every single string,

23:00.921 --> 23:01.961
holding all of them down.

23:03.090 --> 23:04.609
[Griffin] If you're not pressing down
hard enough,

23:04.633 --> 23:06.111
it doesn't quite have the same effect.

23:06.135 --> 23:08.715
Dude! This is a snooze-a-palooza.

23:09.054 --> 23:10.854
I wanna shred the solo on <i>Paradise City.</i>

23:11.765 --> 23:14.305
Well, please,
by all means, Garrett, go ahead.

23:14.602 --> 23:16.022
You have to teach me first.

23:16.937 --> 23:19.227
Right. Exactly like before.

23:19.773 --> 23:21.783
[cell ringing]

23:27.448 --> 23:28.488
From your chick?

23:29.950 --> 23:30.950
What? No.

23:31.410 --> 23:32.750
She's sexting?

23:33.329 --> 23:34.579
Lemme peep that.

Damn it!

25:33.365 --> 25:34.365
Crap!

25:35.951 --> 25:36.951
It was going great.

25:37.745 --> 25:39.655
It was going great,
and I started getting cocky.

25:39.747 --> 25:42.347
I got cocky, started cracking jokes
that clearly didn't make sense

25:42.624 --> 25:43.794
and I made it awkward!

25:47.796 --> 25:48.796

[sighs]

25:58.515 --> 25:59.555
[laughs]

26:02.061 --> 26:03.521
Probably just poor reception.

26:03.854 --> 26:05.864
[car engine roars]

26:06.231 --> 26:09.151
[Chad] Remind me again why I am invited
to your sister's rehearsal dinner?

26:09.193 --> 26:10.863
Well, she was your first babysitter.

26:11.111 --> 26:12.321
And she gave you baths.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.744
So she has an intimate knowledge
of your penis.

26:14.823 --> 26:17.503
Terrific. Well, I can't wait to bond
with her new husband over that.

26:18.243 --> 26:19.243
Aw.

26:19.495 --> 26:22.035
We're early,
and the catering's gonna suck.

26:23.207 --> 26:25.207
- Oh! Wanna grab a bite?
- Sure.

26:27.086 --> 26:30.586
Two buck longnecks, half-priced wells
till 6:00, guys. What'll it be?

26:32.132 --> 26:35.262
Uh... Well... Yeah, I guess...

26:35.677 --> 26:37.677
- Long neck.
- Preference?

26:38.764 --> 26:39.764
Surprise me?

26:41.517 --> 26:42.517
Yeah. Good for me.

26:42.559 --> 26:43.559
Gotcha.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.023
I almost forgot...

26:52.569 --> 26:53.989
We're doing 10 dollar buckets.

26:54.863 --> 26:56.873
Great deal, Tracy.

26:57.533 --> 26:59.543
- Bucket it is.
- You got it, sweetheart.

27:01.328 --> 27:02.368
She didn't card us!

27:02.996 --> 27:04.366
I've no idea what we just ordered.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.456
It's the suits! The ties!

27:06.667 --> 27:08.457
We look like everyone else in here.

27:09.044 --> 27:10.364
[Chad] You mean like businessmen!

27:11.255 --> 27:13.255
- No!
- Yeah...

27:15.676 --> 27:17.386
Crazy day at the CBOE, huh, guys?

27:17.469 --> 27:18.599
[groans]

27:19.054 --> 27:21.314
So crazy. Yeah!

27:21.890 --> 27:22.770
How did you know?

27:22.850 --> 27:24.450
Most of other traders are already drunk.

27:24.601 --> 27:26.601
Well, I guess we got
some catching up to do.

27:27.771 --> 27:28.771
To our new friend, Tracy.

27:29.690 --> 27:30.690
You guys are sweet!

27:34.069 --> 27:36.909
[Christine] Why is it okay
that everyone else can have a thing like

27:37.156 --> 27:39.576
a capella or tattoo sleeves,

27:39.783 --> 27:42.333
but I'm an outcast at school
because my thing

27:42.578 --> 27:43.748
is Jesus?

27:43.871 --> 27:46.331
I mean...
I feel like I can't even say "Jesus"

27:46.415 --> 27:48.035
without making people uncomfortable.

27:48.792 --> 27:49.792
Jesus!

27:50.210 --> 27:51.590
- Jesus!
- Right.

27:52.212 --> 27:55.592
Like when I suggested a Bible study
to the guys I bodybuild with,

27:57.009 --> 27:58.009
they laughed at me.

27:58.886 --> 28:00.596
You're a Christian bodybuilder?

28:01.180 --> 28:02.430
You never told me that.

28:02.514 --> 28:03.354
I dabble.

28:03.432 --> 28:04.432
[laughs]

28:05.309 --> 28:06.519
Let's all pray.

28:08.353 --> 28:09.353
Dear Lord,

28:09.646 --> 28:13.686
we thank you for the opportunity
to break bread and share your bounty.

28:14.193 --> 28:16.823
And we welcome my newest friend, Foster,

28:17.696 --> 28:19.946
who has been a beacon of hope for me

28:20.032 --> 28:23.332
amid the confusion
and darkness of adolescence.

28:23.660 --> 28:26.160
- [Christine] We search...
- [boy] Dude, go home.

28:26.413 --> 28:27.413
You got no shot.

28:29.124 --> 28:30.334
I'm here for Jesus.

28:30.584 --> 28:32.094
Seriously. Give up.

28:32.628 --> 28:33.918
What do you know?

28:34.004 --> 28:35.004
Man to man?

28:35.714 --> 28:37.724
Telling ya. She doesn't even kiss.

28:38.592 --> 28:39.592
[smacks]

28:44.932 --> 28:46.868
- [man] <i>What the...</i>
- [Walter] <i>Have they called yet?</i>

28:46.892 --> 28:48.442
<i>What the hell is this?</i>

28:48.852 --> 28:50.102
<i>My dirty undies, dude.</i>

28:50.354 --> 28:51.404
<i>Laundry. The whites.</i>

28:51.772 --> 28:52.862
- [laughs]
- [man] <i>Walter,</i>

28:52.940 --> 28:55.650
<i>I'm sure there's a reason
you brought your dirty undies, man.</i>

28:55.734 --> 28:58.824
[Walter] <i>That's right, dude. The white.</i>
<i>The ringer could not look empty.</i>

28:59.404 --> 29:01.414
[Griffin] How have you not seen
<i>The Big Lebowski?</i>

29:02.157 --> 29:03.367
[Phoebe] The Dude abides.

29:03.617 --> 29:06.077
[Griffin] It's impossible to go wrong
with the Coen brothers.

29:06.662 --> 29:07.702
<i>Fargo?</i>

29:07.829 --> 29:10.039
<i>- No Country For Old Men? Blood Simple?</i>
- [chuckles]

29:10.290 --> 29:12.500
You're so full of it right now.

29:12.834 --> 29:15.304
Your IMDB app is literally exploding.

29:15.379 --> 29:17.709
I'm sorry, IMDB?

29:17.839 --> 29:19.525
[European accent] What is this
you speak of?

29:19.549 --> 29:20.929
[laughs] No, what accent is that?

29:21.051 --> 29:22.141
Like, Dracula?

29:22.219 --> 29:23.469
- No.
- Let me see your phone.

29:23.720 --> 29:25.260
- Hey. No, hey!
- Let me see it.

29:25.389 --> 29:26.679
Hey! No! You're in... Hey! Stop!

29:27.099 --> 29:29.099
You're invading
my personal bubble here, okay?

29:30.811 --> 29:31.811
[Phoebe throat]

29:32.437 --> 29:34.437
Do you wanna get some food or something?

29:35.691 --> 29:37.691
I'm sorry, I promised my mom.

29:37.776 --> 29:39.356
She ordered Chinese.

29:39.861 --> 29:40.861
No, it's cool.

29:41.071 --> 29:43.071
I didn't mean to cross over into,

29:43.323 --> 29:45.333
you know, official date territory.

29:46.076 --> 29:48.076
Not that it would have been our first,
by the way.

29:49.371 --> 29:51.421
Eighth grade. Bladeland.

29:51.665 --> 29:54.495
Yeah. You may recall it was retro night.

29:54.626 --> 29:56.746
That's right. With the four wheel skates.

29:56.837 --> 29:58.587
- And the disco ball.
- [laughs]

29:58.714 --> 30:00.514
Remember they had that couple skate?

30:00.590 --> 30:03.550
And they played, like, a cheesy slow song
and we had to do a lap.

30:03.885 --> 30:06.725
Well, yeah, we did two so I could work up
the courage to hold your hand.

30:06.888 --> 30:07.928
Did you?

30:08.598 --> 30:10.808
No. You would have remembered,
I'm quite the interlacer.

30:11.601 --> 30:13.351
I probably would have taken us both down.

30:14.271 --> 30:15.861
I would have cushioned your fall.

30:16.356 --> 30:17.356
Aw.

30:17.858 --> 30:19.228
Then you left for school.

30:20.319 --> 30:23.109
Yeah. Came home for Thanksgiving
and it's like the whole world here

30:23.196 --> 30:24.276
had changed.

30:24.364 --> 30:25.784
The abyss of high school.

30:35.667 --> 30:36.667
This is me.

30:38.962 --> 30:41.132
I had fun tonight. Thank you.

30:41.631 --> 30:42.631
Sure.

30:44.259 --> 30:45.589
- Night.
- Night.

30:53.852 --> 30:56.312
So, do you have a boyfriend?

30:57.230 --> 30:58.230
I used to.

30:59.024 --> 31:00.614
This guy named Tyler.

31:02.110 --> 31:03.610
He was kind of a slacker.

31:03.695 --> 31:06.445
Netflix and chill is like
his life mantra.

31:06.782 --> 31:08.242
So why did you date him?

31:09.701 --> 31:10.701
I don't know.

31:11.203 --> 31:13.083
My friend Erin wanted me to date him.

31:13.246 --> 31:16.036
And he wasn't, like, the worst option,
so I guess he was okay.

31:17.334 --> 31:19.674
Why would you settle for a boy
who's just okay?

31:21.254 --> 31:22.304
I don't know.

31:23.048 --> 31:24.718
Nobody has ever asked me that before.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.390
[laughs]

31:29.971 --> 31:31.971
I always get the biscuits and gravy.

31:33.016 --> 31:34.596
- Even for dinner time.
- [Erin laughs]

31:34.893 --> 31:35.893
Thanks.

31:36.186 --> 31:38.726
So, do you bring
all your first dates here?

31:39.606 --> 31:41.726
Oh, only the ones I land on.

31:43.527 --> 31:45.107
No, this place reminds me of home.

31:45.529 --> 31:46.529
But never for a date.

31:47.072 --> 31:48.242
Mmm, where's home?

31:48.907 --> 31:49.907
Falls City, Texas.

31:51.201 --> 31:53.541
Couple thousand people.
I actually grew up on a ranch.

31:53.870 --> 31:56.120
Wow. [laughs]
Big change, huh?

31:56.998 --> 31:58.118
- Yes, ma'am.
- [Erin laughs]

32:00.127 --> 32:04.337
Shouldn't you be, like, out with your
teammates getting drunk with groupies?

32:04.840 --> 32:06.200
Shoot, am I late for that already?

32:06.758 --> 32:07.758
Um...

32:08.468 --> 32:09.798
No, I've...

32:10.512 --> 32:11.722
I have an opportunity here

32:11.805 --> 32:13.095
and I don't wanna blow it.

32:13.807 --> 32:15.517
My parents sacrificed a lot.

32:15.725 --> 32:18.765
And I kind of owe it to them
to take this seriously.

32:20.105 --> 32:22.015
You're making it very hard to judge you.

32:22.441 --> 32:23.691
[laughs]

32:23.817 --> 32:24.817
You wanted to judge me?

32:25.110 --> 32:28.320
Not wanted, but expected... yeah.

32:28.822 --> 32:31.492
I mean, come on.
It's no secret how ball players are.

32:31.867 --> 32:32.867
Not a newsflash.

32:33.118 --> 32:35.118
Oh, yeah. No, you're right.

32:36.163 --> 32:39.373
Um... Most of my teammates
are set, you know?

32:39.541 --> 32:41.751
And I am still playing off of
my minor league contract,

32:41.877 --> 32:43.877
so it's just... different.

32:44.004 --> 32:46.884
[inhales] Plus, drunk groupies...

32:47.048 --> 32:48.088
not my idea of fun.

32:48.592 --> 32:50.762
Well, what is your idea of fun?

32:54.055 --> 32:56.055
[laughs]

33:18.538 --> 33:19.538
[sighs]

33:19.623 --> 33:20.623
[scoffs]

33:21.249 --> 33:22.079
Honey baby,

33:22.167 --> 33:24.837
are you almost done?
It's like 2,000 degrees out.

33:25.212 --> 33:26.962
- Last coat.
- "Honey baby"?

33:27.047 --> 33:28.507
- [Paige sighs]
- [Alec] Shut up.

33:28.590 --> 33:30.050
Summer sucks.

33:30.717 --> 33:33.257
Everyone's working.
Do you have any suggestions?

33:34.387 --> 33:35.427
You could get a job.

33:36.431 --> 33:37.431
Why?

33:54.574 --> 33:57.204
- [Alec] Foster! Bro!
- Uh?

34:00.247 --> 34:01.247
The sidewalk!

34:04.251 --> 34:05.631

[music stops]

47:38.773 --> 47:39.943
[under breath] Yes!

47:40.608 --> 47:42.818
Oh, uh... All set for the nine o'clock.

47:43.027 --> 47:45.447
Yeah. The 9:00 a.m. got moved up.
It's over.

47:45.696 --> 47:47.566
- They've all gone.
- Gone where?

47:47.865 --> 47:48.985
I think to get coffee.

47:52.870 --> 47:53.870
[exhales]

47:54.288 --> 47:56.288
[Mom] All right, guys. We're headed out.

47:56.916 --> 47:58.916
It's just a fundraiser,
so we won't be late.

47:59.085 --> 48:00.205
Be good.

48:00.669 --> 48:02.269
And Sierra, thanks for watching Griffin.

48:02.463 --> 48:03.463
Ten bucks an hour.

48:03.964 --> 48:05.634
Twelve if I have to play with him.

48:06.258 --> 48:07.588
That's my little attorney.

48:10.137 --> 48:11.137
Griffin?

48:12.098 --> 48:13.098
You okay?

48:14.183 --> 48:16.353
- Girl trouble!
- I'm not having girl troubles.

48:17.478 --> 48:19.608
[door opens and closes]

48:19.688 --> 48:21.568
[Phoebe] <i>Honestly, I'd be so mad!</i>

48:22.108 --> 48:23.868
You have to tell her.
Are you gonna tell her?

48:24.026 --> 48:25.146
[Griffin] I don't know. I...

48:25.569 --> 48:26.569
Maybe. I...

48:27.113 --> 48:28.703
I don't know. I think. I... [sighs]

48:29.573 --> 48:31.533
I hate that he put me in this position.

48:31.700 --> 48:32.700
It shouldn't surprise me.

48:32.785 --> 48:35.389
Just when things are going right
for the first time I can remember,

48:35.413 --> 48:37.083
he comes in and wrecks everything.

48:38.082 --> 48:39.082
It will work out.

48:41.127 --> 48:42.957
[sighs] I'm sorry to lay this on you.

48:43.045 --> 48:44.981
I know you're under the gun
with your film, and...

48:45.005 --> 48:46.665
No, I'm glad you told me.

48:47.091 --> 48:48.091
Really.

48:48.968 --> 48:49.968
The film is the film.

48:51.053 --> 48:54.183
Well... It's turning out incredible.

48:54.557 --> 48:55.387
Really?

48:55.474 --> 48:56.604
For sure.

48:56.684 --> 48:59.037
[clicks tongue] Come on. Flattery will not
win me prize money.

48:59.061 --> 49:01.191
Okay? I need ideas to make it better.

49:01.272 --> 49:03.072
It's amazing, Phoebe.

49:03.149 --> 49:04.149
[sighs]

49:04.733 --> 49:06.293
You might have
to start wearing a beret.

49:06.902 --> 49:08.402
Beret? You think?

49:09.447 --> 49:10.807
Would you even date such a person?

49:11.824 --> 49:12.954
Probably not.

49:13.033 --> 49:14.033
[laughs]

49:17.705 --> 49:20.245
Griffin, I can't afford NYU.

49:22.334 --> 49:23.254
What?

49:23.335 --> 49:26.915
That's why this film festival
is so important to me.

49:27.673 --> 49:29.933
Why I didn't want anything to distract me.

49:31.093 --> 49:33.973
I applied for every loan, every grant...

49:34.054 --> 49:35.644
You know how you just need

49:36.015 --> 49:39.935
one fucking win in your life
so badly you can't even explain it?

49:40.019 --> 49:43.109
So stop being nice
and tell me what I can fix.

49:43.856 --> 49:44.856
Okay.

49:46.525 --> 49:48.025
What are you doing after the summer?

49:48.110 --> 49:49.110
Plans-wise.

49:49.445 --> 49:52.235
Plans? I'm living 'em now, bro.

49:53.157 --> 49:55.277
- Actually thinking about going pro, man.
- Yeah?

49:55.743 --> 49:58.413
Me too, actually.
The Cubs could use an arm.

49:58.746 --> 49:59.746
[laughs]

50:00.331 --> 50:01.331
Right.

50:02.708 --> 50:05.038
So, what's the deal with you and Pheebs?

50:05.419 --> 50:06.939
You two seeing each other in New York?

50:07.046 --> 50:08.876
Or is this just a summer fling?

50:08.964 --> 50:10.224
We haven't talked about it yet.

50:10.299 --> 50:12.379
Ah! Keeping the mystery alive.

50:12.468 --> 50:13.888
- [laughs]
- [Mason] I dig it, man.

50:13.969 --> 50:14.799
[Mason] Which reminds me,

50:14.887 --> 50:17.927
I'm having a party on the 4th of July,
you two should definitely come.

50:18.015 --> 50:19.475
- What, your cabin?
- [Mason] Yeah.

50:20.267 --> 50:21.137
Yeah, sounds fun.

50:21.227 --> 50:23.597
You know, I think you can help me
with something.

50:24.230 --> 50:27.000
I want to engage your mixing expertise
on a little somethin'-somethin'.

50:27.024 --> 50:27.864
- [Griffin] Yeah?
- Yeah.

50:27.942 --> 50:29.862
Got this special event on the horizon.

50:29.944 --> 50:31.904
- [Mason] Gonna be dope.
- Yeah, of course.

50:31.987 --> 50:34.867
[shouting] Yeah!
Nice, Zachary!

50:35.074 --> 50:36.454
Maybe I've got this all wrong.

50:36.784 --> 50:38.512
[Griffin] I should be like you
and worry about...

50:38.536 --> 50:40.906
Catching a buzz? [laughs]
A breeze?

50:41.455 --> 50:42.915
Hitting my tricks.

50:42.998 --> 50:43.998
[laughs]

50:44.375 --> 50:45.535
Why hurry to worry,

50:45.793 --> 50:46.673

[laughs]

50:49.255 --> 50:50.335
Woo!

50:52.383 --> 50:53.633
You need more cheese-head, like

50:54.552 --> 50:55.762
[Wisconsin accent] Wisconsin.

50:56.262 --> 50:57.642
Wisconsin.

50:57.930 --> 51:02.230
[Wisconsin accent] Wisconsin cheese
is the cheesiest.

51:02.685 --> 51:04.475
- You're gonna kill it.
- [laughs]

51:04.562 --> 51:07.272
[Lilah's mom] You guys, it's on!
Come on, it's on!

51:07.856 --> 51:10.106
Oh! <i>Sixteen Candles.</i>

51:11.735 --> 51:13.025
Here it comes.

51:13.112 --> 51:14.672
[Lilah's mom] There's Molly Ringwald...

51:15.197 --> 51:17.827
and that's me.
The little girl crossing the street.

51:18.075 --> 51:20.325
Wait. You were an extra?

51:20.578 --> 51:21.578
Lilah...

51:21.787 --> 51:23.537
I was Wedding Girl Number Three.

51:25.833 --> 51:27.083

51:27.876 --> 51:31.086
[car horns honking] [siren wails]

51:31.505 --> 51:33.215
[Reece] Chad, look. They're back!

51:33.507 --> 51:35.507
[Janet] Are you serious? [laughs]

51:36.093 --> 51:38.493
Saw the bloodbath in the market
today, guys. These are on me.

51:38.846 --> 51:41.216
Hey, T, what's the scoop
on those two over there?

51:41.974 --> 51:43.734
Janet and Claire. Advertising, I think.

51:44.226 --> 51:46.016
- Mmm.
- Oh, God. They saw me.

51:46.186 --> 51:47.346
Probably think I'm a stalker.

51:47.396 --> 51:49.791
It's no big of a deal. You'll be fine,
just be cool, hey, breathe.

51:49.815 --> 51:51.355
- [inhales]
- Ooo.

51:51.442 --> 51:52.442
Breathe with me.

51:52.484 --> 51:54.114
[heavy inhale and exhale]

51:54.278 --> 51:56.818
- Here you go, buddy. Oh, they're here.
- Okay.

51:58.198 --> 51:59.328
Mind if we join you guys?

51:59.908 --> 52:01.198
Absolutely. Have a seat!

52:01.535 --> 52:02.655
[chuckles]

52:02.870 --> 52:04.040
[clears throat] So...

52:04.913 --> 52:06.923
I'm Reece, this is Chad...

52:07.166 --> 52:08.326
- Mm-hmm.
- [clears throat]

52:08.417 --> 52:10.497
- So what brings you lovely ladies...
- Reece?

52:10.961 --> 52:11.961
Chad?

52:13.422 --> 52:15.972
How about we cut the shit
and order some shots?

52:25.809 --> 52:27.189
[knocking on door]

52:30.856 --> 52:32.646
[Phoebe's mom] Hi, Griffin!

52:32.733 --> 52:33.733
I'm Phoebe's mom.

52:33.776 --> 52:35.896
It's so nice to finally meet you.
Come on in.

52:41.200 --> 52:43.200
Hey, hi, yeah...

52:43.285 --> 52:45.445
Nice to meet you... too. [inhales]

52:59.968 --> 53:01.488
[Phoebe's mom] Can I get you anything?

53:04.473 --> 53:05.773
I'm good. Thanks.

53:05.891 --> 53:08.851
You sure about that?
That was a pretty long "um".

53:08.977 --> 53:10.517
We have soda, water...

53:10.979 --> 53:12.649
I'm... really, I'm fine.

53:13.524 --> 53:14.524
[Phoebe] Hey!

53:15.109 --> 53:17.819
- So you guys finally met?
- And I look like this.

53:18.195 --> 53:19.915
[Phoebe's mom] I just got back
from the gym.

53:19.988 --> 53:22.868
I'm not surprised...
with your exciting dating life.

53:23.242 --> 53:24.282
She's never home anymore.

53:24.368 --> 53:26.538
I feel like she's the teenager
and I'm the mom.

53:26.912 --> 53:28.952
- My exciting dating life.
- [Phoebe] No, I love it!

53:29.748 --> 53:32.038
[Phoebe] This guy might actually
be a keeper.

53:32.876 --> 53:34.996
Anyway, honey, Griffin doesn't care
about any of this.

53:36.380 --> 53:37.380
No.

53:40.384 --> 53:42.894
Okay. Well, that's our cue
to hit the road.

53:43.345 --> 53:45.345
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

53:46.223 --> 53:50.103
[Phoebe] So, is this party
at Mason's cabin, like, BYO-Indica?

53:52.312 --> 53:53.312
What's up?

53:54.356 --> 53:55.356
Nothing.

53:56.942 --> 53:58.492
Did my mom say something weird?

53:59.278 --> 54:00.278
I mean, I love her.

54:00.738 --> 54:04.368
She's my best friend,
but she's still a mom. [chuckles]

54:05.409 --> 54:06.539
No, she's fine.

54:06.910 --> 54:09.290
She was just sharing
all that dating stuff, I guess.

54:09.371 --> 54:11.041
Yeah. She always does that.

54:11.331 --> 54:12.961
I mean, talking too much.

54:13.041 --> 54:14.921
But... whatever.

54:15.043 --> 54:17.463
She's in a good place right now, so...

54:18.964 --> 54:19.964
With this guy?

54:20.674 --> 54:21.974
So he's...

54:22.176 --> 54:23.886
I mean, I guess she really likes him.

54:23.969 --> 54:25.929
I mean, at her age she's lucky

54:26.013 --> 54:28.563
to find someone
who isn't like a serial killer,

54:28.640 --> 54:30.640
married or both, so...

54:31.059 --> 54:32.439
I'm like, you go, girl!

54:35.022 --> 54:36.652
You sure she didn't say anything?

54:37.232 --> 54:38.232
No.

54:38.567 --> 54:40.407
I just wasn't expecting
to meet her right then.

54:41.862 --> 54:43.782
You are not good at acting
off the cuff, are you?

54:44.323 --> 54:45.323
[scoffs]

54:50.913 --> 54:52.793
- Oh!
- Like this.

54:53.332 --> 54:54.582
Last call, kids.

54:55.083 --> 54:58.593
Okay, so our firm
is one big popularity contest.

54:58.670 --> 55:02.300
We have the cool kids,
you have the nerds, the...

55:02.716 --> 55:03.836
the outcast.

55:04.426 --> 55:06.886
It's like high school all over again.

55:06.970 --> 55:08.720
I know exactly what you mean.

55:08.847 --> 55:10.137
This guy I was seeing

55:10.599 --> 55:13.309
got a slogan on a bottle of mustard,

55:13.560 --> 55:16.360
and thought it entitled him
to sleep with everyone.

55:17.397 --> 55:18.687
"Spicy goodness".

55:19.399 --> 55:22.609
Two words
and he thinks he is J.K. Rowling.

55:23.153 --> 55:24.663
Sorry. Nerdy reference?

55:24.738 --> 55:25.988
No. Are you a Potterhead?

55:26.323 --> 55:27.203
Guilty.

55:27.282 --> 55:29.792
Okay, I am stopping
this topic of conversation.

55:30.077 --> 55:31.287
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

55:31.912 --> 55:35.212
I got a sense of it and I'm drawing
my final conclusions and... [inhales]

55:36.917 --> 55:38.627
Your old boyfriend is an idiot.

55:39.253 --> 55:41.963
[Chad] He doesn't deserve you.
I mean... look at you. You're...

55:43.215 --> 55:44.215
Totally hot.

55:45.175 --> 55:46.755
- [small laugh]
- And smart.

55:47.594 --> 55:49.144
Uh, and stuff.

55:51.223 --> 55:52.223
Take me home.

55:55.102 --> 55:57.022
You don't want to hang out anymore?

55:57.563 --> 55:59.653
[laughs]

55:59.773 --> 56:02.443
- You are hysterical!

56:11.660 --> 56:14.040

near Wrigley.

56:14.746 --> 56:16.326
No, it's amazing.

56:16.915 --> 56:20.205
[Chad] Good, high ceilings... Central air.

56:21.128 --> 56:22.338
[Chad] Big windows.

56:24.673 --> 56:26.173
Hm... Decent view of the city.

56:27.467 --> 56:28.467
Pretty cool...

56:35.225 --> 56:37.935
Do you know what the first thing
I noticed about you was?

56:41.982 --> 56:42.982
Your tie.

56:44.109 --> 56:46.109
Yeah, well.
I'm still getting used to them.

57:51.760 --> 57:54.560
We're gonna borrow your car,
some Vicodin and your credit card tonight.

57:54.596 --> 57:55.636
You good with that?

57:56.264 --> 57:58.274
[moaning]

57:59.101 --> 58:00.481
[laughs]

58:00.852 --> 58:01.982
[laughing] Out of her mind.

58:02.896 --> 58:05.896
Are you still gonna have time to meet
with that college rep? I mean,

58:06.274 --> 58:07.784
it seems kind of a lot.

58:07.901 --> 58:09.651
Yeah, well, it turns out

58:09.861 --> 58:12.951
that the admissions guy from Clarke
is gonna be in town.

58:13.991 --> 58:15.911
But I don't know
if I even want to meet with him.

58:15.951 --> 58:17.041
Audrey, are you kidding?

58:18.036 --> 58:21.746
The only way to get off the waitlist
is to go for it. I mean,

58:22.082 --> 58:23.962
you should be calling every day.

58:24.042 --> 58:25.542
Getting rec letters...

58:25.752 --> 58:27.002
sending flowers to his wife...

58:27.087 --> 58:29.377
Do I really want to spend
four years in Dubuque?

58:31.133 --> 58:32.513
Hurts my heart.

58:33.885 --> 58:34.885
I don't know.

58:35.262 --> 58:37.102
Hey, speaking of hearts,

58:37.180 --> 58:39.470
are we expecting a good season
for the Cubs?

58:40.267 --> 58:41.437
Let's just say,

58:41.518 --> 58:44.398
I am very glad
to be going to school here in the city.

58:44.479 --> 58:48.069
- Ooo!
- [Lilah's mom shouts] More Vicodin!

58:48.984 --> 58:50.284
[laughs]

58:50.444 --> 58:52.654
[whispering] Oh my God! What's that?

58:53.488 --> 58:54.948
Oh, my God, I just peed a little.

58:55.032 --> 58:56.832
[chuckles] Wait.

58:57.576 --> 58:58.946
You're thinking about dumping her?

58:59.036 --> 59:01.036
We never have anything to talk about.

59:01.580 --> 59:03.580
And why are you trying to talk?

59:03.832 --> 59:07.092
[scoffs] The same reason I try
to talk to you and instantly regret it.

59:10.505 --> 59:12.505
If Paige Wilcox wants to date you,

59:13.425 --> 59:17.135
you date Paige Wilcox
until Paige Wilcox is done with you.

59:17.429 --> 59:18.559
Say Paige Wilcox again.

59:19.181 --> 59:20.601
I will if it makes her appear.

59:23.060 --> 59:25.350
So Milo and Lucy totally have
this twin thing going on.

59:25.687 --> 59:28.817
Like, Lucy got stung by a bee,
and I swear Milo could feel it.

59:29.232 --> 59:30.782
And they talk to each other.

59:30.942 --> 59:32.942
No joke. They have conversations.

59:33.028 --> 59:35.048
[Paige] Like in the kitchen the other day,
oh, my God.

59:35.072 --> 59:36.792
They were just chatting
and going on and on,

59:36.865 --> 59:38.195
it was the cutest thing ever.

59:38.325 --> 59:40.325
I'm pretty sure
they were talking about cheese.

59:41.453 --> 59:43.463
So, how do you keep yourself busy
in the summer?

59:44.039 --> 59:45.959
I do driveway sealing.

59:46.041 --> 59:48.171
You know, like blacktop?

59:48.251 --> 59:50.501
It's just a summer gig,
but it's my own business.

59:50.754 --> 59:53.594
Ew, does that involve manual labor?

59:54.007 --> 59:55.007
Uh, yeah.

59:55.050 --> 59:57.140
Boring. Moving on. Hot tub, anyone?

59:57.219 --> 59:58.799
Hot tub, everyone.

59:58.887 --> 01:00:00.967
- [Mrs. Wilcox] Woo hoo!
- [man] Yeah, I'll take 'em.

01:00:01.014 --> 01:00:02.184
[roars]

01:00:04.935 --> 01:00:05.935
[sighs]

01:00:48.061 --> 01:00:52.521
[Erin] Okay, this is amazing!
We are on the field! [laughs]

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:55.823
- Welcome to my office.
- Wow!

01:00:56.862 --> 01:00:57.862
[chuckles]

01:00:58.238 --> 01:00:59.608
Where are you taking me?

01:01:01.783 --> 01:01:03.163
Just wanna show you something.

01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:05.450
Okay. [giggles]

01:01:05.745 --> 01:01:06.745
Come on.

01:01:10.167 --> 01:01:11.247
[Erin] Oop! [laughs]

01:01:11.918 --> 01:01:13.838
A little scary, but I gotcha.

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.050
- There you go.
- Thank you.

01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:16.130
Good job.

01:01:19.467 --> 01:01:22.177
This is the scoreboard?

01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:28.600
Okay, my dad is going to flip out

01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:30.095
when I tell him about this.

01:01:30.854 --> 01:01:31.944
Pretty cool, huh?

01:01:33.481 --> 01:01:34.731
You threw a picnic?

01:01:34.816 --> 01:01:36.396
Little bit, yeah.

01:01:36.568 --> 01:01:38.358
- Hope you're hungry.
- So cute.

01:01:39.446 --> 01:01:40.446
[gasps]

01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:42.741
[Santos] Oh, yeah.

01:01:46.745 --> 01:01:47.865
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:01:48.330 --> 01:01:50.010
That's where we met right there. Remember?

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:51.210
[Erin] Ah! Yeah.

01:01:52.626 --> 01:01:53.456
Wow!

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:54.673
Pretty cool, huh?

01:01:55.545 --> 01:01:57.505
Yeah. [chuckles]

01:01:57.672 --> 01:02:00.932
You've only been here three months
and you already own the place.

01:02:02.010 --> 01:02:04.600
Uh, yeah, at least until I hit
my rookie slump.

01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:07.849
Not on my watch, sir.

01:02:08.266 --> 01:02:11.806
Well, you know I am batting .344
since I ruined your dress,

01:02:12.270 --> 01:02:15.940
so I guess you are kind of
my good luck charm.

01:02:16.024 --> 01:02:17.194
See?

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:22.320
[romantic guitar music plays]

01:02:43.969 --> 01:02:45.719
[uplifting music playing]

01:03:08.785 --> 01:03:10.155
- I come in peace.
- Hey.

01:03:11.705 --> 01:03:13.455
Sorry to ambush you. I...

01:03:13.665 --> 01:03:15.145
- I sent you texts, but I...
- I know.

01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:18.588
I'm sorry. Things have just been
kind of crazy lately.

01:03:19.754 --> 01:03:20.884
[Alec] Sure. Um...

01:03:22.507 --> 01:03:24.127
Listen, I've been thinking...

01:03:24.926 --> 01:03:25.926
and...

01:03:26.386 --> 01:03:28.506
the summer is just going by way too fast.

01:03:29.431 --> 01:03:32.561
And I wanted to see you
before we both leave for school.

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:38.820
Should I take that as a no?

01:03:39.024 --> 01:03:40.864
Alec, we had an agreement.

01:03:41.901 --> 01:03:43.781
Then you went and posted pictures

01:03:43.903 --> 01:03:46.113
with your new girlfriend
15 minutes after we broke up.

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:48.200
She posted that. I...

01:03:50.744 --> 01:03:52.204
You know what? You're right.

01:03:52.537 --> 01:03:54.327
I'm sorry. I hated that she did that,

01:03:54.414 --> 01:03:56.294
and I wanted you to know
it's nothing like that.

01:03:56.333 --> 01:03:57.883
What is it like with Party Paige?

01:03:57.959 --> 01:03:59.249
[car engine roars]

01:03:59.336 --> 01:04:00.416
[sighs] It's...

01:04:01.713 --> 01:04:03.093
[car engine revving]

01:04:06.009 --> 01:04:07.009
Hey!

01:04:08.595 --> 01:04:10.595
Wait, is that... That's...

01:04:10.722 --> 01:04:12.722
I gotta go. But, um...

01:04:12.807 --> 01:04:14.227
Have a nice 4th, okay?

01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:17.232
What is this?

01:04:17.312 --> 01:04:19.772
I got signed to Under Armour,
so no more squeaky brakes.

01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:22.335
- [Erin] Nice. Can I give this to you?
- [Santos] Absolutely. I'll take it.

01:04:22.359 --> 01:04:24.670
- [Erin] Very nice. I really like it.
- [Santos] Kinda cool, huh?

01:04:24.694 --> 01:04:26.614
[Santos] A lot more horsepower
than the last car.

01:04:28.323 --> 01:04:29.453
[car engine roars]

01:04:30.075 --> 01:04:31.325
Happy Independence Day.

01:04:32.285 --> 01:04:33.285
[screams]

01:04:37.248 --> 01:04:39.248
[cheering]

01:04:49.636 --> 01:04:51.716
One, two, three!

01:04:58.019 --> 01:04:59.649
Woo!

01:05:01.981 --> 01:05:03.651
- [girl] Yeah!
- [boy] Go get 'em, man!

01:05:03.983 --> 01:05:04.983
Yeah!

01:05:09.864 --> 01:05:11.494
- [yells]
- [Mason] Woo!

01:05:13.118 --> 01:05:14.118
Yes!

01:05:15.537 --> 01:05:16.537
Woo!

01:05:17.831 --> 01:05:19.831
[teens yell]

01:05:29.217 --> 01:05:30.217
[Mason] Here we go!

01:05:30.593 --> 01:05:31.853
[cheering]

01:05:32.804 --> 01:05:33.814
Mm-mm.

01:05:34.973 --> 01:05:36.773
- [girl 1] Hi!
- [girl 2] Oh, my God!

01:05:37.142 --> 01:05:38.812
- They are perfection! Can I feel?
- Sure.

01:05:39.144 --> 01:05:41.064
Oh, my God!

01:05:41.479 --> 01:05:43.189
That's my kind of ilk.

01:05:43.273 --> 01:05:45.283
The dude that I told you about.
He's hot for you.

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:46.400
Right?

01:05:49.112 --> 01:05:51.112
[Claire] Just look around here.

01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:54.741
Three million people
all trying to get ahead of each other.

01:05:55.034 --> 01:05:57.044
Everyone fighting for the same spot.

01:05:57.412 --> 01:05:59.412
I guess I never really thought of it
like that.

01:05:59.581 --> 01:06:01.001
Yeah, that's because

01:06:01.082 --> 01:06:02.542
you cutthroat traders

01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:04.228
are too busy pillaging
your way to the top.

01:06:04.252 --> 01:06:05.842
[laughs]

01:06:06.796 --> 01:06:10.216
You're the first guy I've met here
who I don't feel has a secret agenda.

01:06:10.383 --> 01:06:12.393
Quick pit stop
before we head to the fireworks?

01:06:12.594 --> 01:06:13.854
For sure. [laughs]

01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:21.729
I'm sorry. Is this Chicago,
or is this Heaven?

01:06:22.228 --> 01:06:23.558
No, dude. We gotta tell 'em.

01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:27.474
Claire wants me to have lunch with her dad
who's a big honcho at Morgan Stanley.

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:29.297
Wear the yellow tie. Says old school.

01:06:29.694 --> 01:06:30.694
Dude, I'm not kidding.

01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:33.070
Chad, remember...

01:06:33.198 --> 01:06:35.068
in a few weeks we're leaving for college.

01:06:35.450 --> 01:06:36.450
And the girls?

01:06:36.493 --> 01:06:40.123
They move on to some workforce douchebags
way worse than we are.

01:06:43.875 --> 01:06:45.625
[indistinct voices]

01:06:46.294 --> 01:06:47.714
[snores]

01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:57.011
[explosions and screams]

01:06:57.430 --> 01:06:58.680
[Griffin] O-kay.

01:06:58.765 --> 01:07:00.265
- Seriously?
- [boy] Woo!

01:07:00.391 --> 01:07:02.101
[laughs]

01:07:03.144 --> 01:07:03.984
You wanna...

01:07:04.062 --> 01:07:05.062
Yeah.

01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:06.270
[chuckles]

01:07:07.232 --> 01:07:10.152
I bet you had to fight off all the girls
with a stick this summer.

01:07:10.235 --> 01:07:11.735
[chuckles]

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:15.160
Actually, you might be surprised.

01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:16.780
Really?

01:07:22.455 --> 01:07:23.785
I was thinking...

01:07:24.123 --> 01:07:26.133
why we don't go find our own spot

01:07:26.292 --> 01:07:28.092
and make our own fireworks?

01:07:32.215 --> 01:07:33.585
So you can tell me where I rank!

01:07:34.634 --> 01:07:36.224
Wait. What?

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:38.886
Let me just publicly declare

01:07:39.305 --> 01:07:42.725
that I'm not the next fool
to fallfor this idiot's hook-up list.

01:07:44.519 --> 01:07:45.519
[chuckles]

01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:48.730
It's gone viral, douchebag!

01:07:49.482 --> 01:07:50.822
No one is gonna sleep with you.

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:51.900
Ever.

01:07:56.072 --> 01:07:57.572
- Ew!
- Ah!

01:07:57.949 --> 01:07:59.329
- [girl] Jerk!
- Ah!

01:08:00.827 --> 01:08:02.497
[Lilah] Look at the stars.

01:08:03.788 --> 01:08:04.998
Just like you someday.

01:08:05.665 --> 01:08:06.665
I don't know.

01:08:07.208 --> 01:08:09.208
What? You're so talented.

01:08:10.003 --> 01:08:12.013
You'll at least have a lot of choices.

01:08:12.714 --> 01:08:13.714
Well.

01:08:14.215 --> 01:08:15.835
I mean, you will too, Audrey.

01:08:16.259 --> 01:08:17.779
Have you heard back from that college?

01:08:18.094 --> 01:08:19.144
Nah.

01:08:19.845 --> 01:08:22.176
Still just waiting around
for the low-hanging fruit.

01:08:23.558 --> 01:08:24.558
Wait.

01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:27.189
College has fruit?

01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:28.270
[chuckles]

01:08:28.854 --> 01:08:30.354
It's an expression.

01:08:32.358 --> 01:08:35.448
I've been settling for anything
that's left on the tree.

01:08:36.237 --> 01:08:37.357
My ex.

01:08:38.238 --> 01:08:40.158
My college. This job.

01:08:40.366 --> 01:08:41.366
Wait.

01:08:41.783 --> 01:08:44.663
Why would you ever
just settle for anything?

01:08:45.496 --> 01:08:48.366
And what do you mean, this job?

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:49.877
[laughing] No offense.

01:08:50.585 --> 01:08:52.835
No, I mean, you're really good at it.

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:56.260
And you're like my favorite person
that's ever worked for my mom.

01:08:56.716 --> 01:08:58.716
And there's been more than I can count.

01:08:59.926 --> 01:09:01.256
I am?

01:09:03.514 --> 01:09:05.524
Yeah, [laughs] you are.

01:09:08.645 --> 01:09:11.015
Yeah, well, I mean, I am pretty awesome.

01:09:11.104 --> 01:09:12.625
- [fireworks explosion]
- [Audrey sighs]

01:09:12.649 --> 01:09:14.069
Look, they're starting!

01:09:14.192 --> 01:09:16.152
[chuckles]

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:18.819
They look so close! Whoa!

01:09:28.331 --> 01:09:30.331
- Wow.
- Yeah.

01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:32.964
[Phoebe] It's nice.

01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:37.381
I can't imagine what that party
is looking like now.

01:09:37.756 --> 01:09:39.046
Yup. [laughs]

01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:43.176
I'd much prefer doing something like this.

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:47.430
I think I've always sort of been
an outsider on the inside.

01:09:47.934 --> 01:09:48.934
You know?

01:09:51.938 --> 01:09:53.308
Sometimes I feel like...

01:09:53.981 --> 01:09:57.321
I'm floating over my body,
like, watching my interactions.

01:09:57.610 --> 01:09:59.950
[laughs] An observer, for sure.

01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:01.780
I feel it too.

01:10:02.407 --> 01:10:05.027
Like, my dad's not in the picture, and...

01:10:06.202 --> 01:10:09.332
I think I handle it better
because I feel it less.

01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:11.536
Sometimes I...

01:10:13.459 --> 01:10:14.589
fear...

01:10:15.670 --> 01:10:16.710
whether I'm...

01:10:17.797 --> 01:10:19.797
even capable of love.

01:10:21.342 --> 01:10:25.642
Or if I'm just destined to observe it
for the rest of my life.

01:10:26.931 --> 01:10:28.061
You know what I mean?

01:10:28.391 --> 01:10:30.391
I wish I felt less sometimes.

01:10:31.561 --> 01:10:34.111
But I don't think
you need to worry about it.

01:10:34.439 --> 01:10:36.439
No, I just... I worry...

01:10:38.025 --> 01:10:39.895
if I've never been able

01:10:39.986 --> 01:10:41.986
to fully let my guard down with someone,

01:10:42.947 --> 01:10:44.237
maybe I'm not capable.

01:10:46.325 --> 01:10:47.825
Look, Phoebe.

01:10:50.329 --> 01:10:52.329
I'm gonna be real honest with you.

01:10:54.167 --> 01:10:56.167
I would like to be that person.

01:10:59.422 --> 01:11:00.552
And I love...

01:11:01.048 --> 01:11:04.758
that you are
a way-too-wise-for-your-years artist.

01:11:05.887 --> 01:11:07.887
And that you look like an angel,

01:11:08.765 --> 01:11:09.765
a sex goddess,

01:11:10.349 --> 01:11:12.729
and a nerdy librarian,
all at the same moment.

01:11:14.061 --> 01:11:16.061
Not that you look
like a librarian, or a nerd.

01:11:16.773 --> 01:11:17.773
I love nerds.

01:11:18.649 --> 01:11:20.109
- Not in a weird way.
- [chuckles]

01:11:25.573 --> 01:11:26.573
Phoebe.

01:11:26.824 --> 01:11:28.454
There's something I have to tell you.

01:11:28.659 --> 01:11:29.909
I'm listening.

01:11:30.328 --> 01:11:32.248
I can't tell you while you're kissing me.

01:11:32.413 --> 01:11:34.423
I'm not very good at taking direction.

01:11:36.042 --> 01:11:37.462
What do you wanna tell me?

01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:47.135
[sighs]

01:11:50.306 --> 01:11:53.016
I don't know.
I just... I have to tell you that...

01:11:55.144 --> 01:11:57.944
I'm so embarassingly in love with you.

01:12:02.735 --> 01:12:04.025
[whispering] I'm here.

01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:07.200
I'm right here.

01:12:12.537 --> 01:12:13.617
[crickets chirping]

01:12:13.788 --> 01:12:15.057
[Santos] Yeah, your cake was a hit, huh?

01:12:15.081 --> 01:12:16.671
[Erin] Yeah. Did people like it?

01:12:16.749 --> 01:12:18.852
[Santos] I think they did.
It looks like it's all gone.

01:12:18.876 --> 01:12:19.876
[Erin] Oh, good.

01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:22.022
[Santos] We're a really good cooking team.

01:12:22.046 --> 01:12:24.046
- [Erin] I think so.
- [Santos] Oh yeah.

01:12:25.216 --> 01:12:27.546
- [Erin] It's so beautiful here.
- Yeah.

01:12:28.761 --> 01:12:30.221
Yeah, this place is great.

01:12:31.138 --> 01:12:33.138
- Thanks for helping me find it.
- You're welcome.

01:12:34.475 --> 01:12:36.805
And this barbecue that you did
was first class.

01:12:37.103 --> 01:12:40.693
The last one that I hosted
had plastic chairs and a pig roast.

01:12:41.023 --> 01:12:42.042
I know what you mean. [laughs]

01:12:42.066 --> 01:12:45.026
I'm used to parties
where people are taking shots and...

01:12:45.278 --> 01:12:46.488
- throwing up everywhere.
- Ew.

01:12:46.571 --> 01:12:47.571
Mm-hmm. [chuckles]

01:12:48.614 --> 01:12:50.694
The guys on the team enjoyed
seeing you here tonight.

01:12:50.825 --> 01:12:51.825
Mm-mm.

01:12:53.744 --> 01:12:55.004
I told them to get used to it.

01:13:08.301 --> 01:13:10.741
- You're gonna lose. [laughs]
- Oh, my... [laughs] Oh, my God!

01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:12.470
Big fail.

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:14.470
You are not gonna believe it!

01:13:14.682 --> 01:13:15.932
I submitted your reel,

01:13:16.142 --> 01:13:17.982
and you have a tryout

01:13:18.102 --> 01:13:19.402
with <i> America's Got Talent.</i>

01:13:19.979 --> 01:13:21.707
[Lilah's mom] But we have
a lot of work to do before then,

01:13:21.731 --> 01:13:23.651
so I want to start
full rehearsals this Friday.

01:13:23.983 --> 01:13:25.033
This Friday?

01:13:25.776 --> 01:13:28.816
But... Audrey and I were going
to the beach. We had a whole plan.

01:13:28.905 --> 01:13:30.655
You can go to the beach any day.

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:31.990
This is the big time.

01:13:32.491 --> 01:13:34.161
[Lilah's mom] This could be national TV.

01:13:34.535 --> 01:13:37.215
[Lilah's mom] So Sebastian's coming over
to work on your inflection.

01:13:37.330 --> 01:13:39.250
I think <i> Baby Love</i> will knock 'em dead.

01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:42.210
You want me to sing?
You know I hate singing.

01:13:42.293 --> 01:13:44.633
Lilah, you have a beautiful voice.

01:13:44.795 --> 01:13:46.355
So, unless you have some hidden talent,

01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:48.052
like juggling blindfolded,

01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:49.837
you are going to sing.

01:13:50.176 --> 01:13:51.676
[footsteps moving away]

01:13:53.387 --> 01:13:54.467
[car engine roars]

01:13:54.555 --> 01:13:57.345
[man on the radio] <i>...and there's a smash</i>
<i>from Ricky down the line.</i>

01:13:57.433 --> 01:13:59.393
<i>This kid is unbelievably hot.</i>

01:13:59.602 --> 01:14:01.272
[sighs] This sucks.

01:14:01.395 --> 01:14:03.725
I'm rooting against my own team
because of that guy.

01:14:03.814 --> 01:14:06.114
He, y bro, which is worse?
My hookup list flameout

01:14:06.359 --> 01:14:08.359
or you ending things with Paige willingly?

01:14:08.444 --> 01:14:11.534
I'm sorry, bro.
She has the IQ of a toaster.

01:14:11.906 --> 01:14:12.906
I can't do it.

01:14:13.115 --> 01:14:14.365
This was gonna be the summer.

01:14:14.742 --> 01:14:17.142
- I'd been planning it for months.
- No. Don't sweat it, bro.

01:14:17.203 --> 01:14:19.503
Honestly, the hookup gods
are just punishing you

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:21.210
because you were getting too greedy.

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:23.670
- I don't know, man...
- No, seriously, bro.

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:25.210
From the fat kid in 8th grade

01:14:25.294 --> 01:14:27.714
to the jacked badass sitting
next to me right now,

01:14:27.797 --> 01:14:30.037
you had a pretty sick run
with the ladies in high school.

01:14:30.383 --> 01:14:33.763
Yes. You did. You did it. [laughs]

01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:40.350
Right?

01:14:42.937 --> 01:14:43.937
Wait...

01:14:44.397 --> 01:14:46.767
Wait, wait... [chuckles] what?

01:14:47.692 --> 01:14:48.692
- You're...
- [sighs]

01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:51.736
No! [laughs]

01:14:52.613 --> 01:14:53.493
What?

01:14:53.572 --> 01:14:55.008
- How can this even be possible?
- [laughs]

01:14:55.032 --> 01:14:56.552
[stammers] I don't know man, I just...

01:14:56.909 --> 01:14:58.659
You know, I was so busy with ball,

01:14:58.744 --> 01:15:00.624
you know, I was traveling every weekend

01:15:00.705 --> 01:15:02.665
and had camps every summer,
I just never really...

01:15:04.291 --> 01:15:05.791
But I just figured, you know...

01:15:06.252 --> 01:15:08.922
This was the summer
I'd make up for lost time.

01:15:10.214 --> 01:15:11.214
[laughs]

01:15:12.967 --> 01:15:14.297
I don't know, man, I...

01:15:14.969 --> 01:15:16.969
I guess that list was pretty lame.

01:15:18.097 --> 01:15:19.427
Kinda got what I deserved.

01:15:19.515 --> 01:15:20.515
[scoffs]

01:15:20.850 --> 01:15:21.850
Forget it, man.

01:15:22.101 --> 01:15:23.381
All right? Just clean the slate.

01:15:23.436 --> 01:15:25.436
[birds chirping]

01:15:26.689 --> 01:15:28.269
[electronic music plays]

01:15:36.741 --> 01:15:37.991
[cell ringing]

01:15:38.826 --> 01:15:39.656
May-sawn!

01:15:39.744 --> 01:15:40.744
Griff!

01:15:40.786 --> 01:15:42.456
Dude, how's my mix coming?

01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:43.460
[Griffin] <i>Sounding sick.</i>

01:15:43.539 --> 01:15:44.766
Dude, I'm working on it right now.

01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:47.144
We're sitting at 100 beats per minute,
you're gonna love it.

01:15:47.168 --> 01:15:49.368
[Griffin] <i>It's not your usual</i>
<i>chillin' out bongapalooza.</i>

01:15:49.462 --> 01:15:50.712
Perfect, bro.

01:15:50.963 --> 01:15:53.223
I'm stoked. Special occasion.

01:15:53.758 --> 01:15:55.008
[Griffin] <i>Special occasion?</i>

01:15:55.676 --> 01:15:57.466
Oh, hell, yeah. [laughs]

01:15:57.636 --> 01:15:58.636
[Mason] <i>Thanks, bro.</i>

01:16:00.973 --> 01:16:02.143
[knocking on door]

01:16:02.725 --> 01:16:04.085
- Hey, honey!
- [Griffin] Hey, Mom.

01:16:04.435 --> 01:16:06.435
Oh, you have a friend downstairs.

01:16:07.855 --> 01:16:08.855
Cute.

01:16:17.823 --> 01:16:18.823
Hey.

01:16:20.367 --> 01:16:21.537
Guess what?

01:16:23.788 --> 01:16:24.958
You okay?

01:16:25.039 --> 01:16:26.329
No, my mom found out

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:28.705
that the piece of shit
she's been dating is married.

01:16:30.336 --> 01:16:31.546
Can you believe that?

01:16:33.047 --> 01:16:34.047
Oh.

01:16:35.549 --> 01:16:36.549
I'm so sorry.

01:16:36.801 --> 01:16:38.051
Is this an epidemic?

01:16:38.135 --> 01:16:40.505
Like, can anyone be faithful anymore?

01:16:40.596 --> 01:16:43.096
You know, my mom feels like
she's been sucker-punched,

01:16:43.182 --> 01:16:45.602
and it makes me feel
like you can't trust anyone.

01:16:45.726 --> 01:16:48.436
He just seemed like the most normal guy.

01:16:48.729 --> 01:16:51.069
- Have you met him?
- Yeah, once. Why?

01:16:51.398 --> 01:16:52.438
No. I'm...

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:54.490
just processing this.

01:16:54.985 --> 01:16:56.775
It makes me want to tell his family.

01:16:57.738 --> 01:16:59.448
Did you... talk to her?

01:16:59.532 --> 01:17:00.872
No, no. I haven't.

01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:02.120
Well, you have to.

01:17:02.785 --> 01:17:04.785
Look. We have to talk.

01:17:05.246 --> 01:17:06.246
Come on.

01:17:07.665 --> 01:17:09.665
- Bye, Mom.
- [Griffin's mom] Wait.

01:17:11.252 --> 01:17:12.252
You're taking off?

01:17:12.545 --> 01:17:14.545
Yeah. We're just gonna go for a walk.

01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:16.470
It was really nice to finally meet you.

01:17:16.715 --> 01:17:20.085
[Phoebe] You raised a great son.
One of the last good ones, maybe.

01:17:20.469 --> 01:17:22.049
He always speaks very highly of you.

01:17:22.138 --> 01:17:23.388
[sighs] Thank you.

01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:25.890
He's a pretty great one, isn't he?

01:17:25.975 --> 01:17:28.185
Okay. Let's not get me too much credit.

01:17:28.727 --> 01:17:30.727
- Bye, Mom.
- [Griffin's mom] Have fun.

01:17:37.194 --> 01:17:39.664
Sorry. I shouldn't have said
you have to tell her.

01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:42.370
I know it's up to you in your own time.
But I really wanna...

01:17:42.575 --> 01:17:43.985
call this guy's family

01:17:44.118 --> 01:17:45.918
- and just tear his life apart.
- Hey, Phoebe.

01:17:49.582 --> 01:17:52.082
Look. I know who your mom has been seeing.

01:17:52.585 --> 01:17:53.585
What?

01:17:55.546 --> 01:17:56.706
The guy from the gym.

01:17:58.215 --> 01:18:00.335
- I tried to tell you...
- What are you talking about?

01:18:14.857 --> 01:18:15.857
Is that your dad?

01:18:18.777 --> 01:18:20.777
[car door opens and closes]

01:18:22.239 --> 01:18:23.239
You knew?

01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:28.660
- [under breath] My God.
- Phoebe, I'm sorry.

01:18:28.787 --> 01:18:31.707
I'm gonna be sick, or I'm gonna
punch something, I don't know which.

01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:34.210
So when you saw him with the woman,

01:18:34.293 --> 01:18:35.633
then you met my mom, you...

01:18:37.922 --> 01:18:40.092
So, you've known...
How long ago was that, like a week?

01:18:40.216 --> 01:18:41.216
Five days.

01:18:41.383 --> 01:18:43.583
So the whole of the 4th of July
together you were lying.

01:18:43.844 --> 01:18:45.764
I wanted to tell you. I tried to tell you.

No, I should thank you, Griffin.

Because I almost started to let my guard
down for the first time in my life,

But this is his shit. I didn't do this.

01:19:01.654 --> 01:19:03.574
You knew that my mom thought this was real

01:19:03.656 --> 01:19:05.066
and you went along and did nothing.

Can you give me one second?

01:19:14.792 --> 01:19:17.712

But it's over. I put an end to it.

01:19:44.738 --> 01:19:45.818
So you wouldn't get caught.

01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:49.080

even telling the truth right now.

with her daughter may seem...

01:30:27.756 --> 01:30:31.426
Yeah. Well, my GPA suffered the past
two years because I've been working.

01:30:31.509 --> 01:30:32.589
Pretty much all the time.

01:30:32.928 --> 01:30:34.348
Oh! In what capacities?

01:30:34.429 --> 01:30:36.429
Fast-food joint, coffee shop.

01:30:37.098 --> 01:30:38.808
You take what you can get, you know?

01:30:38.892 --> 01:30:41.522
Well, obviously,
we can't offer admission to everyone.

01:30:41.853 --> 01:30:44.665
And believe me, you would be lucky
to have our institution in your life.

01:30:44.689 --> 01:30:46.779
Nonetheless, we do see some potential...

01:30:47.108 --> 01:30:49.398
and that is why we are willing
to take a risk

01:30:49.903 --> 01:30:51.913
and offer you admission to Clarke College.

01:30:52.364 --> 01:30:53.204
You mean I'm in?

01:30:53.281 --> 01:30:54.571
On a probationary basis.

01:30:54.658 --> 01:30:56.093
- What's that mean?
- You may enroll,

01:30:56.117 --> 01:30:58.117
but you will not be
eligible for campus housing,

01:30:58.536 --> 01:31:00.246
the Greek system or student government.

01:31:01.289 --> 01:31:04.039
So basically I am shut out
of all the fun parts of college.

01:31:04.584 --> 01:31:05.674
Congratulations.

01:31:07.253 --> 01:31:08.593
Mr. Edmunds...

01:31:10.507 --> 01:31:11.547
I pass.

01:31:11.633 --> 01:31:12.633
[Mr. Edmunds] What?

01:31:14.302 --> 01:31:16.302
You guys were my last choice and...

01:31:17.097 --> 01:31:18.217
I don't wanna settle.

01:31:18.348 --> 01:31:19.742
[Mr. Edmunds] You're passing on us?

01:31:19.766 --> 01:31:21.766
So, you're left with nothing?

01:31:22.936 --> 01:31:23.936
No.

01:31:25.939 --> 01:31:27.109
I'm left with me.

01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:31.610
Look, I may not know what I'm gonna do,

01:31:32.445 --> 01:31:34.655
instead of attending my backup school,

01:31:34.739 --> 01:31:36.779
on a probationary basis.

01:31:36.866 --> 01:31:38.866
But whatever it is...

01:31:39.661 --> 01:31:41.961
[chuckles] I'm gonna kick
the shit out of it.

01:31:45.041 --> 01:31:46.251
Thank you, Mr. Edmunds.

01:31:50.463 --> 01:31:53.383
Twenty-three driveways
and two parking lots. Record summer.

01:31:53.466 --> 01:31:55.466
No doubt. I'm beat.

01:31:55.802 --> 01:31:57.762
Hey, you think you can handle
this invoice for me?

01:31:58.346 --> 01:31:59.926
There's something I need to do.

01:32:01.307 --> 01:32:03.637
That sounds extremely vague, but...

01:32:03.727 --> 01:32:04.557
[laughs]

01:32:04.644 --> 01:32:06.274
sure. Go ahead, I'll finish up.

01:32:07.897 --> 01:32:09.897
- Good work this summer.
- You too.

01:32:15.739 --> 01:32:16.739
[sighs]

01:32:18.283 --> 01:32:19.283
[knocking on door]

01:32:24.414 --> 01:32:26.294
So we're all finished. Mrs. Davis.

01:32:26.374 --> 01:32:29.504
Oh, not Mrs. anymore. Nicole's fine.

01:32:30.754 --> 01:32:31.844
Looking really good.

01:32:32.422 --> 01:32:33.922
I've been watching you guys all week.

01:32:34.549 --> 01:32:35.549
Yeah.

01:32:36.134 --> 01:32:37.134
Um...

01:32:37.302 --> 01:32:38.722
So, I've got your invoice.

01:32:39.262 --> 01:32:40.602
Let me go get my checkbook.

01:32:40.764 --> 01:32:42.774
Come on in. I'll get you something cold.

01:32:46.144 --> 01:32:48.024
[Nicole] Unless you're in the mood
for something

01:32:48.313 --> 01:32:49.313
hot.

01:32:58.490 --> 01:33:00.490
[cheering]

01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:03.012
[announcer over PA] <i>And here comes</i>
<i>local product, Mason Riley,</i>

01:33:03.036 --> 01:33:05.656
<i>who has a shot at the podium
here in his final run.</i>

01:33:18.134 --> 01:33:19.134
Woo!

01:33:21.304 --> 01:33:22.894
[cheering]

01:33:41.282 --> 01:33:44.242
[announcer pver PA] <i>He sticks it!</i>
<i>He sticks it!</i>

01:33:44.452 --> 01:33:47.792
<i>You've just punched your ticket
to the fall season tour.</i>

01:33:47.997 --> 01:33:50.037
[crowd cheering] Mason! Mason!

01:33:58.258 --> 01:34:00.968
- [inhales heavly]
- Mmm. Are you okay?

01:34:01.761 --> 01:34:03.391
Two breakups in one summer,

01:34:03.513 --> 01:34:05.603
maybe if I hurry up
I can cram in a third. [laughs]

01:34:05.682 --> 01:34:08.432
Okay, but you don't have time
for those childish games anymore.

01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:11.150
- I mean, you're a college woman now.
- [laughs]

01:34:11.229 --> 01:34:12.519
How was your interview?

01:34:13.606 --> 01:34:15.276
So... big news.

01:34:15.567 --> 01:34:16.567
- [clears thoat]
- Yes?

01:34:17.777 --> 01:34:19.027
I'm not going to college.

01:34:19.904 --> 01:34:22.374
But I am enrolled

01:34:23.366 --> 01:34:24.486
in Teachers Without Borders.

01:34:25.201 --> 01:34:26.831
Well, that's amazing,

01:34:26.911 --> 01:34:29.791
but you're gonna go
to college eventually, right?

01:34:30.206 --> 01:34:31.206
Okay.

01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:34.170
- I love you.
- [Erin] Mm-hmm.

01:34:34.794 --> 01:34:36.804
But we come from different places.

01:34:37.505 --> 01:34:39.295
You just have to understand

01:34:39.382 --> 01:34:42.342
that you've got different opportunities
because of that.

01:34:42.427 --> 01:34:45.387
I'm sorry. Are you upset because
I got into my first choice?

01:34:45.555 --> 01:34:47.805
Because I worked really hard.

01:34:47.891 --> 01:34:50.172
I know you did. And I would never
take that away from you.

01:34:51.603 --> 01:34:53.733
Look, Erin. You're gonna be successful.

01:34:53.813 --> 01:34:54.653
[scoffs]

01:34:54.731 --> 01:34:58.691
I just... I need you to not judge
my version of success.

01:34:59.861 --> 01:35:00.861
Which is...

01:35:01.029 --> 01:35:03.449
- not settling for Dubuque.
- [laughs]

01:35:03.698 --> 01:35:06.528
It's teaching
little twerps English in Borneo.

01:35:06.618 --> 01:35:07.738
- Aw.
- [laughs]

01:35:07.869 --> 01:35:09.119
And it turns out...

01:35:10.496 --> 01:35:11.536
I like kids.

01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:14.170
Mmm. I'm proud of you.

01:35:15.919 --> 01:35:17.589
Are you mad at me?
Are we gonna fight?

01:35:17.670 --> 01:35:20.300
Uh, no. I love you, like, too much.

01:35:20.590 --> 01:35:22.590
-[Erin inhales heavly] Mmm.

01:35:24.010 --> 01:35:25.250
- [Erin] Hmm...
- [Audrey] What?

01:35:25.929 --> 01:35:27.559
[gasps] He came!

01:35:27.639 --> 01:35:29.139
- [Erin] Hm.
- [Audrey] Oh, wow.

01:35:29.224 --> 01:35:30.951
[Audrey] Okay, you gotta go.
This is dramatic enough.

01:35:30.975 --> 01:35:32.975
- Are you sure?
- Go! Get the hell out of here.

01:35:33.102 --> 01:35:35.562
- Okay. I love you.
- I love you. Good luck.

01:35:35.647 --> 01:35:36.647
[under breath] Thanks.

01:35:44.572 --> 01:35:45.572
Hey.

01:35:46.532 --> 01:35:48.082
Your parents sent me an invite.

01:35:48.159 --> 01:35:49.399
I wasn't sure if I should come.

01:35:49.786 --> 01:35:50.906
I'm glad you did.

01:35:50.995 --> 01:35:52.535
[chuckles]

01:35:53.915 --> 01:35:55.275
So where's the rookie of the year?

01:35:55.708 --> 01:35:57.418
Ah. Struck out.

01:35:57.502 --> 01:35:58.922
- [Erin laughs]
- [Alec scoffs]

01:35:59.671 --> 01:36:00.551
What about Paige?

01:36:00.630 --> 01:36:01.670
Turned the page.

01:36:02.131 --> 01:36:03.851
There was a better book
out there somewhere.

01:36:04.008 --> 01:36:05.888
Ah, what was she, a scratch and sniff?

01:36:06.010 --> 01:36:07.640
[laughs]

01:36:09.264 --> 01:36:10.264
I miss smart people.

01:36:12.225 --> 01:36:13.225
I missed you.

01:36:14.602 --> 01:36:15.772
I was thinking...

01:36:16.479 --> 01:36:17.479
Um...

01:36:18.189 --> 01:36:20.069
maybe we weren't ready to break up
when we did.

01:36:20.149 --> 01:36:22.149
Yeah, I think that we thought

01:36:22.986 --> 01:36:25.816
we'd make this moment less sad
if we did it sooner.

01:36:26.155 --> 01:36:28.155
Yeah, it's unavoidable.

01:36:28.366 --> 01:36:30.366
Next week I'm on a plane to Oregon,

01:36:30.910 --> 01:36:32.500
and you'll be up in Evanston.

01:36:33.246 --> 01:36:37.326
Last time we had this conversation,
we agreed to <i>stay</i> friends.

01:36:38.876 --> 01:36:42.046
How about this time
we agree to <i>be </i> friends?

01:36:43.715 --> 01:36:45.045
- Friends.
- [Erin] Friends.

01:36:45.883 --> 01:36:48.223
Okay. Walk away. Erin, walk away.

01:36:48.303 --> 01:36:50.013
- Just friends.
- [Erin] Friends!

01:36:50.096 --> 01:36:51.096
[chuckles]

01:36:58.563 --> 01:37:00.653
For God's sakes... Cake!

01:37:02.025 --> 01:37:04.025
[crowd murmurs quietly]

01:37:23.838 --> 01:37:26.218
Thank you. Yeah. I'm just happy...

01:37:29.761 --> 01:37:30.761
Thank you.

01:37:31.387 --> 01:37:33.387

[Griffin] <i>How are we really meant</i>
<i>to know our future</i>

01:37:46.027 --> 01:37:48.397
<i>if we don't even know the world's future?</i>

01:37:49.530 --> 01:37:51.010
[Griffin] <i>It kinda sounds cheesy, but</i>

01:37:51.324 --> 01:37:52.664
<i>the only thing that really stays</i>

01:37:53.284 --> 01:37:55.294
<i>constant is... love.</i>

01:37:58.331 --> 01:38:02.001
[applause and cheering]

01:38:14.806 --> 01:38:15.926
Thanks so much.

01:38:20.603 --> 01:38:21.693
Congrats.

01:38:23.106 --> 01:38:25.566
If that doesn't win,
I say the whole system's rigged.

01:38:26.943 --> 01:38:27.783
I know. We'll see.

01:38:27.860 --> 01:38:29.780
I'm still pretty nervous, so...

01:38:30.446 --> 01:38:32.816
Thank you for coming, I mean, your work...

01:38:33.449 --> 01:38:34.659
made a big difference.

01:38:37.245 --> 01:38:38.245
Nice crowd.

01:38:38.329 --> 01:38:39.829
I don't know half of these people.

01:38:39.914 --> 01:38:43.674
[Phoebe sighs] I think Mom just invited
a bunch of randoms she met on the El.

01:38:44.168 --> 01:38:45.208
How is she?

01:38:45.795 --> 01:38:47.585
She's good. Thanks.

01:38:48.172 --> 01:38:49.922
Yeah, she looks proud. She should be.

01:38:53.386 --> 01:38:56.426
I really appreciate you coming to her

01:38:57.056 --> 01:38:59.926
and what you said. [inhales]
It took a lot.

01:39:01.853 --> 01:39:03.773
How is it with... with your parents?

01:39:04.814 --> 01:39:05.814
Uh...

01:39:06.190 --> 01:39:07.570
My dad didn't own up to it.

01:39:08.901 --> 01:39:10.401
I told her. I told her myself.

01:39:11.237 --> 01:39:14.237
My mom's a saint. They're trying
to work things out, I guess,

01:39:14.365 --> 01:39:16.205
- but I'm leaving on Friday, so...
- On Friday?

01:39:16.284 --> 01:39:18.294
I thought Columbia had
like two more weeks.

01:39:18.619 --> 01:39:20.539
They do, yeah. I'm going to music school.

01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:22.599
- What? [laughs]
- [Griffin chuckles] Yeah.

01:39:22.623 --> 01:39:26.253
I figured if I'm going scorched earth
with my dad, I may as well go all in.

01:39:26.419 --> 01:39:28.629
He's not paying.
I'm doing financial aid and everything.

01:39:29.797 --> 01:39:32.337
I'm so happy for you, Griff.
That's, that's...

01:39:32.842 --> 01:39:34.142
really good news.

01:39:35.887 --> 01:39:39.177
Listen, Phoebe. Whether you win
this thing or not, doesn't matter.

01:39:40.016 --> 01:39:40.846
You've already proven

01:39:40.933 --> 01:39:43.133
that this is clearly
what you were supposed to be doing.

01:39:43.769 --> 01:39:45.269
NYU is lucky to have you.

01:39:46.481 --> 01:39:47.481
Thanks.

01:39:47.523 --> 01:39:50.252
[Phoebe's grandpa] Phoebe! You're too busy
for your grandparents? [laughs]

01:39:50.276 --> 01:39:51.526

Is summer really over?

01:40:49.794 --> 01:40:50.794
[laughs]

01:40:51.128 --> 01:40:54.048
- How'd you know...
- I thought I might find you here.

01:40:55.007 --> 01:40:56.087
[chuckles]

01:40:57.802 --> 01:40:59.802
Thanks, by the way.

01:41:01.264 --> 01:41:02.894
It's, um... very thoughtful.

01:41:04.809 --> 01:41:05.809
It looks good on you.

01:41:08.813 --> 01:41:10.823
So, shouldn't you be out celebrating?

01:41:11.816 --> 01:41:13.816
With new admirers and hangers-on?

01:41:15.111 --> 01:41:16.401
Who says I'm not?
