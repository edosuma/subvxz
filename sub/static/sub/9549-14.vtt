WEBVTT

00:08.974 --> 00:10.840
Okay, he's here.
He's right out front.

00:10.910 --> 00:12.241
Okay. I'm ready.

00:12.312 --> 00:13.301
What are you
gonna say?

00:13.380 --> 00:14.404
I don't know.

00:14.781 --> 00:16.111
I'll just tell him.

00:16.181 --> 00:17.672
How do you think
he's gonna take it?

00:17.751 --> 00:19.947
I don't know. It's Monk.
It'll probably get weird.

00:20.021 --> 00:21.249
Yeah. I'm glad
Natalie's with him.

00:21.322 --> 00:22.983
Ah, me too. Hey.
Hey.

00:23.057 --> 00:24.490
Hey.
What's going on?

00:24.558 --> 00:25.547
You said it
was important?

00:25.626 --> 00:26.957
I did. Monk,
have a seat.

00:27.028 --> 00:28.052
Why?

00:28.129 --> 00:30.121
Just... No reason.
Just...

00:41.944 --> 00:44.708
Monk, Friday night,
the review board

00:45.081 --> 00:48.312
and the commissioner met in a
private session to talk about you.

00:48.384 --> 00:49.647
About me?

00:50.020 --> 00:52.250
I was there.
So was Dr. Bell.

00:55.692 --> 00:57.785
And they came
to a decision.

01:02.467 --> 01:04.697
They don't want to use you as
a private consultant anymore.

01:04.769 --> 01:05.758
I knew it.

01:05.837 --> 01:07.498
No, no, let me finish. You're firing me!

01:07.572 --> 01:08.835
Nobody said that.
I don't believe it.

01:08.908 --> 01:11.103
Is this because he mopped up the
blood stain in that jewelry store?

01:11.177 --> 01:12.201
This isn't
about that!

01:12.278 --> 01:15.076
So he made one mistake in
eight years, after 120 cases.

01:15.147 --> 01:16.671
He can't make
one mistake?

01:16.749 --> 01:17.774
Let me start over.

01:17.851 --> 01:19.284
Hey, it's been great!
See ya.

01:19.352 --> 01:20.819
Shame on you!

01:20.887 --> 01:22.684
Shame on both of you!

01:24.224 --> 01:26.089
Well, that could've
gone better.

01:26.159 --> 01:28.355
Monk!
Hey, hey, Monk!

01:30.331 --> 01:32.526
Monk! Monk,
you didn't let me finish.

01:32.600 --> 01:34.227
You didn't let
him finish.

01:34.302 --> 01:37.704
We won't be using you as a
consultant because of this.

01:38.941 --> 01:40.340
What is it?

01:48.818 --> 01:51.446
It's long overdue.
That's what it is.

02:09.107 --> 02:10.597
Is this real?

02:22.321 --> 02:23.788
This is real.

02:25.792 --> 02:27.589
I think it's real,
Mr. Monk.

02:27.661 --> 02:29.094
It was the Captain. He
really went to bat for...

02:29.163 --> 02:31.563
I didn't do anything.
It was all you.

02:35.570 --> 02:37.538
Welcome back,
Detective.

02:44.280 --> 02:46.043
Thank you, Captain.

02:52.054 --> 02:53.989
<i>It's a jungle out there</i>

02:54.524 --> 02:57.049
<i>Disorder and confusion
everywhere</i>

02:59.095 --> 03:01.063
<i>No one seems to care</i>

03:01.398 --> 03:02.422
<i>Well, I do</i>

03:02.499 --> 03:05.264
<i>Hey, who's in charge here?</i>

03:05.336 --> 03:07.270
<i>It's a jungle out there</i>

03:09.140 --> 03:11.608
<i>Poison in the very air
we breathe</i>

03:12.477 --> 03:14.570
<i>You know what's in the water
that you drink?</i>

03:14.646 --> 03:15.738
<i>Well, I do</i>

03:15.814 --> 03:18.612
<i>It's amazing</i>

03:19.251 --> 03:20.718
<i>People think I'm crazy</i>

03:20.786 --> 03:22.448
<i>'cause I worry all the time</i>

03:22.522 --> 03:25.389
<i>If you paid attention,
you'd be worried, too</i>

03:25.825 --> 03:27.224
<i>You better pay attention</i>

03:27.293 --> 03:29.454
<i>Or this world
we love so much</i>

03:30.096 --> 03:32.964
<i>might just kill you</i>

03:33.867 --> 03:35.664
<i>I could be wrong now</i>

03:36.103 --> 03:37.900
<i>But I don't think so</i>

03:37.972 --> 03:40.202
<i>'Cause there's
a jungle out there</i>

03:40.708 --> 03:42.609
<i>It's a jungle out there</i>

03:48.321 --> 03:49.811
Mr. Monk, you haven't
eaten your breakfast.

03:49.890 --> 03:51.357
I'm too excited to eat.

03:51.425 --> 03:53.359
You don't want to be hungry.
It's your first day of work.

03:53.427 --> 03:55.190
What time is it?
Roll call's at 8:30.

03:55.262 --> 03:58.254
Natalie, can you believe
it? I am going to roll call.

03:58.332 --> 04:01.268
It's like I'm dreaming.
Maybe I am dreaming.

04:01.837 --> 04:02.861
Ow! What are
you doing?

04:02.938 --> 04:04.235
I'm pinching you
to see if I'm dreaming.

04:04.306 --> 04:05.330
No, you're supposed
to pinch yourself.

04:05.407 --> 04:08.103
Well, I figured you're in the
dream with me. I don't know.

04:08.176 --> 04:09.872
Mr. Monk, you're not dreaming.
It's really happening.

04:09.946 --> 04:11.880
It's really happening.
I'm going.

04:11.948 --> 04:13.415
Oh, oh, oh, wait.
Don't forget your lunch.

04:13.483 --> 04:15.110
Oh, yeah!
Oh, my God.

04:15.184 --> 04:16.515
Thank you.

04:17.086 --> 04:18.110
Wait, wait,
your gun.

04:18.187 --> 04:19.485
Oh, yeah!

04:20.089 --> 04:22.320
Yeah, that might
come in handy.

04:22.693 --> 04:23.853
You polished
the bullets.

04:23.927 --> 04:25.792
Yeah, you don't want to shoot
anybody with a dirty bullet.

04:25.863 --> 04:27.160
They might get
an infection.

04:28.333 --> 04:30.164
God, we're funny together. We are.

04:30.235 --> 04:31.463
I know.

04:31.803 --> 04:33.236
Clip.

04:33.304 --> 04:34.396
Okay.

04:34.606 --> 04:36.233
Oh, look at you.

04:36.307 --> 04:39.471
Detective First Class Adrian
Monk, Homicide Division.

04:39.545 --> 04:41.206
I am proud of you.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.558
I'm gonna miss you.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.098
No, no, no,
don't talk like that.

04:58.166 --> 04:59.326
This isn't
good-bye. No.

04:59.400 --> 05:03.131
No. We're friends.
We'll talk all the time.

05:03.271 --> 05:05.205
Right. About what?

05:06.475 --> 05:09.967
About how we feel,
and what we're doing,

05:10.813 --> 05:12.804
and what we
did that day.

05:13.515 --> 05:15.039
Okay. I can do that.

05:15.150 --> 05:16.277
Okay.

05:18.288 --> 05:20.222
What are
you gonna do?

05:20.390 --> 05:23.951
Oh, I'll be fine. I have a
job interview with Jim Paxton.

05:24.327 --> 05:25.555
Paxton?

05:25.763 --> 05:27.594
The concert promoter.

05:27.965 --> 05:29.193
Really?

05:29.366 --> 05:31.732
He's looking
for a new assistant.

05:33.070 --> 05:34.935
He couldn't
do better.

05:42.514 --> 05:43.742
Well.

05:45.118 --> 05:46.244
Well.

05:48.387 --> 05:49.581
I guess this is it.

05:57.831 --> 05:59.560
Be happy, Mr. Monk.

06:01.034 --> 06:03.366
Okay. I will.

06:20.956 --> 06:21.980
Good morning.

06:22.057 --> 06:23.423
Good morning,
young fella.

06:25.428 --> 06:28.261
Hey, Monk. Welcome back.
How does it feel?

06:28.331 --> 06:29.389
It feels great.

06:29.466 --> 06:31.229
Morning.
Morning.

06:35.573 --> 06:39.441
Okay, let's settle
in. Morning, everyone.

06:40.011 --> 06:41.171
I have an announcement
to make.

06:41.245 --> 06:44.579
This is something I've been
waiting to say for 12 years.

06:44.650 --> 06:46.413
Adrian Monk is back.

06:47.953 --> 06:49.853
Back
where he belongs.

06:52.759 --> 06:55.023
Seventy years ago,
Thomas Wolfe wrote,

06:55.094 --> 06:56.254
"You can't
go home again... "

06:56.329 --> 06:57.660
Monk, you don't
have to say anything.

06:57.730 --> 06:58.788
Thank God.

06:58.865 --> 07:01.858
Okay, first item of business
is the Pickaxe Killer.

07:01.936 --> 07:02.994
Gold Rush Killer.

07:03.070 --> 07:04.469
No, it's not the Gold
Rush Killer, Randy.

07:04.538 --> 07:05.527
Well, they
use pickaxes.

07:05.606 --> 07:07.631
Randy, forget about
the Gold Rush Killer, okay?

07:07.708 --> 07:09.699
Yes, sir.
We're moving on.

07:09.977 --> 07:12.947
Okay, now, I don't need to tell you
folks how important this case is.

07:13.014 --> 07:14.811
However, we have
caught a break.

07:14.883 --> 07:16.646
We've got a witness.

07:16.718 --> 07:19.312
A woman who lived down the
hall from victim number five

07:19.387 --> 07:20.650
has given us
his description.

07:20.723 --> 07:21.747
Take one, pass it back.

07:21.824 --> 07:23.689
We've got
a rough sketch, here.

07:23.759 --> 07:26.284
As you can see, we're
looking for a Caucasian male.

07:26.362 --> 07:30.265
He's short. No more
than 5'4", 5'6" tall.

07:30.767 --> 07:32.792
He's...

07:33.470 --> 07:36.871
He's in his
late 30s, early 40s.

07:37.574 --> 07:39.907
We believe he is
driving a...

07:44.282 --> 07:48.116
We believe that he is
driving a station wagon.

07:49.521 --> 07:52.081
Monk. Monk, just take one and
pass them on. They're perfect.

07:52.157 --> 07:53.419
Just give me
a second, here.

07:53.492 --> 07:56.393
Um, folks,
witness perfection.

07:58.697 --> 07:59.790
Okay.

08:00.200 --> 08:02.634
Good job.
Just pass them on.

08:04.271 --> 08:05.533
Monk, just
give me one.

08:05.605 --> 08:06.799
Take...
Yeah, take that one.

08:06.873 --> 08:08.808
Thank you.
Okay, Thompson, Harris,

08:08.876 --> 08:11.640
I want you to take this
sketch. Work the pickaxe angle.

08:11.712 --> 08:14.806
Circulate that around every
hardware store within 20 miles.

08:14.882 --> 08:17.180
People, we've got five victims
on the wall, which is...

08:17.251 --> 08:20.050
Leland. Leland. ...
five victims too many.

08:20.122 --> 08:22.989
Yes.
Where was I?

08:23.191 --> 08:24.215
Five victims.

08:24.293 --> 08:26.090
Right. Five victims.

08:26.261 --> 08:28.127
By now it's
probably six.

08:29.732 --> 08:31.825
We found it
in the basement.

08:31.901 --> 08:33.299
I had them
bring it upstairs for you.

08:33.369 --> 08:34.802
My old desk.

08:35.405 --> 08:36.429
Oh!

08:41.345 --> 08:42.607
It's still there.

08:42.679 --> 08:44.375
I know, it's like it's
been waiting for you, right?

08:44.448 --> 08:45.540
Yeah.

08:52.057 --> 08:53.081
How do you feel?

08:53.158 --> 08:54.182
I feel like I'm home.

08:54.259 --> 08:55.749
You are home.

08:55.827 --> 09:00.561
So, I thought I could start by reading
the profiles of the five victims.

09:00.633 --> 09:03.568
And then I could visit
the first crime scene.

09:03.803 --> 09:06.466
Listen, Monk, you're
not on the task force.

09:06.540 --> 09:11.034
Here's the deal. I promised the review
board that I would ease you into it.

09:11.278 --> 09:13.712
Ease me into...

09:13.847 --> 09:17.875
They want you on desk duty for a
while, just to get re-acclimated.

09:18.186 --> 09:19.175
For how long?

09:19.253 --> 09:21.244
Just a couple of days.
Maybe a week.

09:21.322 --> 09:22.346
Yeah. Yeah.

09:22.423 --> 09:25.325
Then we're gonna move you
over to Danny Weaver's squad.

09:25.394 --> 09:26.691
He's a great guy.

09:26.762 --> 09:28.992
So, I won't be
working with you?

09:29.198 --> 09:30.222
No.

09:30.566 --> 09:33.126
Randy and I can't
hold your hand anymore.

09:33.202 --> 09:34.932
That's protocol.

09:35.205 --> 09:36.297
Sure.

09:37.774 --> 09:39.867
It's what
you wanted, right?

09:40.377 --> 09:41.708
Absolutely.

09:41.778 --> 09:42.802
You'll be fine.

09:42.879 --> 09:44.939
I figured we'd
put you on the hotline.

09:45.016 --> 09:46.142
Maybe you'll get a lead.

09:46.217 --> 09:47.445
Yeah.

09:47.518 --> 09:48.780
Good.

09:49.220 --> 09:52.212
Russell. This is Officer DiMarco.
He's gonna help you get settled in.

09:52.289 --> 09:55.555
Hi. Wow, it is a real,
real honor to meet you, sir.

09:55.694 --> 09:58.492
Honestly, I've been reading
about your cases for years.

09:58.563 --> 10:00.258
I even kept a scrapbook for
a while. Remember, Captain?

10:00.332 --> 10:01.697
Yeah.
Yeah.

10:02.200 --> 10:03.225
Wow.

10:03.302 --> 10:04.894
If you don't mind,

10:04.971 --> 10:07.667
could I, maybe,
keep that as a souvenir?

10:08.307 --> 10:09.296
Sure.

10:09.809 --> 10:11.242
I'll let you
two boys get to it.

10:11.310 --> 10:13.643
I got a lot of work.
I'm drowning back here.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.238
Okay.
Okay. Desk.

10:15.315 --> 10:17.044
So could you hold this
for me for a second?

10:17.117 --> 10:18.141
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Just one second.

10:18.218 --> 10:20.186
Uh... I need to get rid
of this. It's not the '50s.

10:20.254 --> 10:21.312
Wait, wait.
All you need...

10:21.388 --> 10:22.413
What do we have here?

10:22.490 --> 10:24.048
This is
your computer.

10:24.125 --> 10:27.219
Yeah, four terabytes with
a fiber optic web interface.

10:27.295 --> 10:30.458
It's for logging calls.
This is yours.

10:31.566 --> 10:33.330
It's better than handing out
traffic tickets, right?

10:34.937 --> 10:36.928
Why can't I just write
them in the log book?

10:38.007 --> 10:39.975
What's a log book?
I don't...

11:31.333 --> 11:32.527
Tip line.
Detective Monk.

11:35.737 --> 11:36.931
Tip line.
Detective Monk.

11:38.773 --> 11:40.537
Tip line.
Detective Monk.

11:40.610 --> 11:42.202
Hello.
Tip line.

11:42.445 --> 11:43.742
<i>Hello,
is this the police?</i>

11:43.813 --> 11:46.213
Where are you?

11:46.482 --> 11:48.382
<i>Is there anybody there?</i>

11:48.919 --> 11:50.682
<i>Hello.
Hello?</i>

11:50.754 --> 11:52.745
Yes, hello.

11:52.823 --> 11:55.656
This is Detective Monk.
I am wearing a headset.

11:55.726 --> 11:57.318
<i>Are you guys looking
for the Pickaxe Killer?</i>

11:57.394 --> 11:58.384
<i>'Cause I know who it is.</i>

11:58.463 --> 11:59.862
Please hold.

12:07.640 --> 12:08.698
T...

12:09.041 --> 12:10.099
I...

12:10.876 --> 12:12.468
P, P, P, P, P...

12:15.781 --> 12:18.751
Yes. Is the suspect
male or female?

12:18.919 --> 12:21.183
<i>Male. Don't put...
Please hold.</i>

12:24.024 --> 12:25.013
M.

12:26.293 --> 12:28.592
What is the name
of the suspect?

12:28.696 --> 12:30.664
<i>His name is Brian.</i>

12:30.731 --> 12:32.164
<i>Please hold.
Don't put me on hold again...</i>

12:32.934 --> 12:34.492
B...
Monk.

12:34.569 --> 12:36.230
Yeah, just one minute.
I got a tip on the killer.

12:36.305 --> 12:38.432
No, no, no, Monk, we got him.
They just picked him up.

12:38.507 --> 12:40.270
Who?
The Pickaxe Killer.

12:40.342 --> 12:41.331
Well, how? How?

12:41.410 --> 12:43.401
Uh, some window washer
saw him.

12:43.478 --> 12:45.070
Yeah, he saw the guy.
He matched the description.

12:45.147 --> 12:47.343
He flagged down
a traffic cop.

12:47.550 --> 12:50.280
Can you believe it? It's
case closed, just like that.

12:50.353 --> 12:51.877
Just like that.

12:52.522 --> 12:53.955
Great, that's...

12:54.023 --> 12:55.081
Hey!

12:55.993 --> 12:57.654
Good job.

13:00.564 --> 13:02.156
That's really...

13:13.044 --> 13:14.068
Okay.

13:14.145 --> 13:16.774
The suspect's name
is Richard Mathis.

13:16.849 --> 13:19.716
He was apprehended today
without incident

13:19.785 --> 13:22.276
at his home
on Franklin Place.

13:22.855 --> 13:25.586
The people of San
Francisco can rest easy.

13:25.659 --> 13:27.786
<i>The so-called
"Pickaxe Killer"</i>

13:27.861 --> 13:30.421
<i>is in custody
and off the streets.</i>

13:31.932 --> 13:33.901
Is he the guy?
Heard it was a lock.

13:33.968 --> 13:35.492
Found the murder weapon
in the car.

13:35.570 --> 13:37.435
Confessed to all five.

13:37.538 --> 13:39.267
Guess he's the guy.

13:39.440 --> 13:40.498
Want
another ginger ale?

13:40.575 --> 13:43.306
Oh, no, thank you,
but his glass is dirty.

13:43.379 --> 13:44.539
There's a smudge.

13:44.613 --> 13:46.843
I'll get you another.

13:47.216 --> 13:49.810
Now that, gentlemen, is
what you call a real woman.

13:49.885 --> 13:50.874
Yeah.
No doubt about it.

13:50.953 --> 13:53.582
Mmm-hmm. You can tell. No Adam's apple.

13:53.823 --> 13:56.758
No Adam's apple.
That's a new one.

14:00.196 --> 14:01.663
No Adam's apple.

14:01.731 --> 14:04.132
<i>The mayor and I would like
to take this opportunity</i>

14:04.201 --> 14:07.534
<i>to thank the real hero here,
the man of the hour,</i>

14:07.672 --> 14:09.333
<i>Mikel Alvanov.</i>

14:09.440 --> 14:11.271
<i>Come on, up here,
come on.</i>

14:11.342 --> 14:14.141
<i>Mr. Alvanov was working
as a window washer.</i>

14:14.212 --> 14:16.680
<i>He was on the sixth floor
of the Burkman Building</i>

14:16.748 --> 14:18.147
<i>when he noticed
the suspect.</i>

14:18.216 --> 14:20.707
<i>And I see a green
station wagon,</i>

14:20.786 --> 14:23.881
<i>and it's circling
around Jefferson Square,</i>

14:23.956 --> 14:26.618
<i>and it goes a couple times
and then it stops.</i>

14:26.693 --> 14:29.184
<i>And a man gets out,
and something...</i>

14:29.262 --> 14:30.820
<i>It don't look right.</i>

14:30.897 --> 14:33.628
<i>He's nervous,
and he opens the door,</i>

14:33.701 --> 14:35.635
<i>and I see the pickaxe.</i>

14:35.736 --> 14:39.502
<i>So, I write down
the license number.</i>

14:39.606 --> 14:42.940
<i>447 PCE.</i>

14:43.745 --> 14:45.838
<i>And I give this
to police.</i>

14:46.481 --> 14:49.279
<i>I'm sure that anyone
could have done this,</i>

14:49.384 --> 14:50.818
<i>but I'm glad it was me.</i>

14:52.188 --> 14:54.383
So this guy gets
the entire reward.

14:54.457 --> 14:55.788
500 grand.

14:56.158 --> 14:57.682
It's like hitting
the lottery.

14:57.760 --> 14:59.250
I wonder
if he'll quit his job.

14:59.328 --> 15:01.422
Probably already has.
I know I would.

15:01.498 --> 15:02.556
Me too.

15:02.632 --> 15:04.964
Not me.
I'm never quitting.

15:06.336 --> 15:08.133
You really like
answering those phones, huh?

15:08.205 --> 15:10.504
I'm off the phones
as of Monday.

15:10.842 --> 15:12.309
I'll be riding
with Louis here.

15:12.377 --> 15:14.709
Yeah, Monk and Doyle,
the dynamic duo.

15:14.779 --> 15:15.905
That's right.

15:15.980 --> 15:18.414
<i>I'd like to present you
with this key to the city.</i>

15:18.483 --> 15:19.508
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

15:19.585 --> 15:20.745
<i>Congratulations.</i>

15:20.819 --> 15:23.447
<i>Everyone at Main Street Deli,
this is for you guys.</i>

15:24.623 --> 15:25.954
So, how's Natalie?

15:26.024 --> 15:27.423
Oh, she's...

15:27.826 --> 15:30.557
She's working
for that concert promoter.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.120
Rock and roll.

15:32.766 --> 15:34.757
I'm sure
she's miserable.

15:42.343 --> 15:43.571
Mr. Paxton.

15:43.644 --> 15:44.804
I'm sorry.
I mean Jim.

15:44.879 --> 15:47.643
These are the new contracts.
Legal hasn't seen them yet.

15:47.715 --> 15:49.240
Oh, fantastic, yeah.

15:49.317 --> 15:50.409
Let me have those.

15:50.485 --> 15:52.851
Brilliant. Thank you
very much, Teeger.

15:52.921 --> 15:55.651
Oh, Teeger, have you heard
the new Coldplay album yet?

15:55.724 --> 15:56.713
No.

15:56.792 --> 16:00.058
You know, I think you should go back
to your desk, take a listen to it.

16:00.129 --> 16:01.460
Okay. Why?

16:01.531 --> 16:02.555
Because the people
that we're gonna be

16:02.632 --> 16:04.122
having dinner with
tonight are probably

16:04.200 --> 16:05.895
gonna ask you a few
questions about it.

16:05.968 --> 16:07.334
Who are we
having dinner with?

16:07.404 --> 16:08.666
Coldplay.

16:08.806 --> 16:10.330
Coldplay?
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

16:10.407 --> 16:13.103
They're touring next year,
looking for a new promoter.

16:13.177 --> 16:14.508
Aren't they
playing in Denver?

16:14.578 --> 16:15.772
Yep. Yeah,
I think they are.

16:15.846 --> 16:17.678
Okay, then I'll
call the airline.

16:17.749 --> 16:19.512
Mmm-hmm.
Better yet,

16:19.584 --> 16:21.051
let's take my plane.

16:21.119 --> 16:23.246
Yes. Better yet,
let's do that.

16:23.321 --> 16:24.549
Let's take your plane.

16:24.622 --> 16:25.680
Yeah. Fantastic.

16:25.757 --> 16:27.350
Okay, thank you.

16:38.805 --> 16:39.965
You ready?

16:40.040 --> 16:41.530
It's been 12 years.

16:41.608 --> 16:43.007
It'll come back to you.
It's like sex.

16:43.076 --> 16:45.204
Well, not sex. I mean, something you do.

16:45.279 --> 16:47.304
Edith Capriani?
I'm Sergeant Doyle.

16:47.381 --> 16:50.407
And I'm Detective
First Class Adrian Monk.

16:51.085 --> 16:53.747
We received a call that
there was a reported homicide.

16:53.821 --> 16:55.380
Yeah, he tried
to kill me.

16:55.457 --> 16:56.719
Who tried to kill you, ma'am?

16:56.792 --> 16:58.919
Mr. Barton.
He lives with me.

16:59.595 --> 17:01.586
He tried to
suffocate me.

17:02.164 --> 17:04.189
Monk, she's seen
the badge.

17:04.266 --> 17:05.290
When did this happen?

17:05.367 --> 17:07.131
This morning in bed.

17:07.203 --> 17:09.034
I woke up,

17:09.472 --> 17:11.804
and he was
covering my mouth!

17:12.141 --> 17:13.608
And is Mr. Barton
still inside?

17:13.675 --> 17:16.544
Yeah.
He's going crazy in there.

17:16.614 --> 17:20.414
He acts as though he owns the
place, but it's my name on the lease.

17:20.483 --> 17:22.315
It's my apartment!

17:23.020 --> 17:25.717
He's a deadbeat.
Good for nothing!

17:26.023 --> 17:28.458
Now, you go in.
I'll cover the back.

17:37.603 --> 17:38.934
Stay here.

18:25.723 --> 18:28.089
Don't shoot!
Oh, don't shoot him!

18:29.226 --> 18:30.956
Don't shoot him.

18:31.597 --> 18:36.057
Oh, Mr. Barton,
I can't stay mad at you.

18:36.134 --> 18:37.192
It's a cat?

18:38.937 --> 18:41.270
He thinks he's people.

18:43.676 --> 18:45.303
Louis, it's okay.

18:45.411 --> 18:47.811
Where are you?
It's a false alarm.

18:52.119 --> 18:53.950
That's the Burkman Building,
isn't it?

18:54.021 --> 18:55.045
So?

19:08.503 --> 19:10.870
Nice shooting,
and nice grouping!

19:11.107 --> 19:12.836
What are you doing?

19:14.377 --> 19:16.038
Just cleaning up for you.

19:16.112 --> 19:18.046
Leave the shells, Monk.

19:19.082 --> 19:20.879
Leave the shells, Monk.

19:20.951 --> 19:22.782
Safety first, right?

19:23.387 --> 19:25.252
Monk, leave the shells.

19:25.322 --> 19:26.789
You know what,
I'll get those later.

19:26.857 --> 19:28.291
What the hell
are you doing here?

19:28.359 --> 19:30.327
It's about
Mikel Alvanov.

19:30.495 --> 19:31.689
Who?
The window washer.

19:31.763 --> 19:33.355
You know,
the guy who got the reward.

19:33.431 --> 19:34.455
What about him?

19:34.532 --> 19:36.591
Well, his story
doesn't track.

19:36.668 --> 19:38.660
Listen, he said he was
on the seventh floor

19:38.737 --> 19:41.797
of the Burkman Building
at 2:30 looking west.

19:41.874 --> 19:43.432
Well, I went back
up there during lunch.

19:43.509 --> 19:44.874
You were probably
wondering where I was.

19:44.943 --> 19:47.378
No. Yeah, well, now you know.

19:47.580 --> 19:49.980
I was up there
at 2:30 looking west.

19:50.050 --> 19:52.348
The sun was
directly in my eyes.

19:52.419 --> 19:53.818
So he was
wearing sunglasses.

19:53.887 --> 19:56.117
No, no, no, he said
he read the license plate.

19:56.189 --> 19:57.418
I have 20l20 vision.

19:57.491 --> 20:00.426
I couldn't read anything from
the seventh floor. Nothing.

20:00.494 --> 20:03.986
Monk, the guy's tip
was righteous. Hmm?

20:04.699 --> 20:06.861
The Pickaxe Killer's
in jail. He confessed.

20:06.935 --> 20:07.993
We have
the murder weapon.

20:08.070 --> 20:10.300
We found pieces of his
victims in his attic.

20:10.372 --> 20:12.897
Yeah, no, no, I know.
I know the tip was good.

20:12.974 --> 20:13.963
Well, what're
you saying?

20:14.042 --> 20:15.600
He's lying, okay?

20:15.677 --> 20:17.805
The window washer's lying.
That's all.

20:17.880 --> 20:19.745
Look, I think I know
what's going on here.

20:19.816 --> 20:21.283
You're jealous.

20:21.350 --> 20:22.612
The big
super detective.

20:22.685 --> 20:24.744
You can't stand the fact
we didn't need you.

20:24.821 --> 20:26.449
No, that's not it.

20:26.523 --> 20:30.220
Monk, look, you got what,
17 open cases on your desk?

20:30.294 --> 20:31.318
Nineteen.

20:32.096 --> 20:33.256
I'm giving you
an order.

20:33.330 --> 20:34.319
Hmm?

20:34.398 --> 20:37.061
Forget the window washer
and let it go.

20:38.002 --> 20:40.971
Okay. You're right.
I'm letting it go.

20:42.607 --> 20:44.769
Wait. I can't let it go!

20:45.144 --> 20:46.668
Let it go!

20:46.879 --> 20:50.315
Okay, there it is. It's gone.
I feel better. Thank you.

21:11.806 --> 21:13.536
Hey, man,
you're late.

21:13.609 --> 21:16.043
This is a little
dramatic, isn't it?

21:16.111 --> 21:18.841
We have an agreement. We
don't be seen together, yeah?

21:18.914 --> 21:22.372
Okay, Mikel. You want to play
secret agent? That's fine by me.

21:22.451 --> 21:24.420
So are we gonna do this?

21:31.861 --> 21:34.387
What are you doing?

22:03.654 --> 22:06.088
Russell DiMarco.
Did you know him?

22:06.256 --> 22:08.019
I met him once.
My first day back.

22:08.091 --> 22:10.959
He was a rookie. Still
on traffic duty, poor kid.

22:11.029 --> 22:12.257
What do you think
he was doing here?

22:12.330 --> 22:14.764
Well, he lives nearby in Crestmont
Village, about a mile away.

22:14.832 --> 22:16.026
He was probably
heading home.

22:16.100 --> 22:17.590
Heading home?
It's a shortcut.

22:17.669 --> 22:19.034
You can cut right
through the parking lot.

22:19.103 --> 22:20.503
Then what?
I don't know.

22:20.572 --> 22:22.972
Maybe he saw something, something
going down and he stopped.

22:23.042 --> 22:24.373
Did he call it in?

22:24.443 --> 22:26.343
He didn't
get a chance.

22:26.712 --> 22:28.145
What's that?

22:30.450 --> 22:32.384
Looks like a coupon.

22:32.585 --> 22:34.610
$0.30 off
Hardy Chow dog food.

22:34.988 --> 22:38.550
He didn't follow the line.
You see, the dotted line there.

22:38.626 --> 22:41.151
Well, not everybody's you.
Thank God.

22:41.462 --> 22:43.259
Do you have a dollar?

22:54.977 --> 22:56.945
It's the same size.

22:57.012 --> 22:59.140
It was a payoff.
That's what he was doing here.

22:59.215 --> 23:01.012
Somebody was
paying DiMarco off,

23:01.084 --> 23:02.551
or that's what
DiMarco thought.

23:02.618 --> 23:04.051
He cut up newspaper

23:04.120 --> 23:06.247
into dollar-sized pieces,
make it look like cash.

23:06.322 --> 23:07.347
Why?

23:07.424 --> 23:10.052
To distract him.
To put him off guard.

23:10.527 --> 23:11.892
And then they shot him.

23:11.962 --> 23:15.261
Or he had a dog, and he
just wanted to save 30 cents.

23:16.835 --> 23:18.427
It was a payoff.

23:20.939 --> 23:22.634
Monk, come on.

23:24.843 --> 23:27.972
Look, the Captain's gonna
be here in a few minutes.

23:28.047 --> 23:29.605
I want to get
this straight.

23:29.682 --> 23:31.445
You saying
this kid is dirty?

23:31.517 --> 23:33.417
It would explain
everything.

23:33.486 --> 23:35.955
Why his safety is still on
and his gun is holstered.

23:36.023 --> 23:37.615
I'm not saying
you're wrong.

23:37.691 --> 23:39.249
You might be right.

23:39.326 --> 23:41.089
But here's
what I am saying.

23:41.161 --> 23:45.063
Until you're sure,
until you're 110%...

23:45.566 --> 23:46.624
Hmm?

23:46.701 --> 23:49.898
You're to shut your face.
Do you understand that?

23:50.204 --> 23:53.105
You're on this side of the
blue line now, Detective Monk.

23:53.174 --> 23:54.903
That kid is family.

23:55.377 --> 23:57.811
So I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

23:58.380 --> 24:00.109
Are you 110%?

24:05.255 --> 24:06.279
No.

24:07.357 --> 24:08.881
Then button it.

24:14.932 --> 24:16.331
Have fun.

24:16.400 --> 24:17.458
What, you're
not coming?

24:17.535 --> 24:19.230
I'm right behind you,
Detective.

24:19.303 --> 24:22.272
Hello, again.
I'm Detective First Class...

24:22.339 --> 24:25.275
I know who you are.
What took you so long?

24:25.343 --> 24:26.708
I've been waiting
for three hours.

24:26.778 --> 24:28.803
He's inside my apartment.

24:28.880 --> 24:31.872
Okay, is this about your
little friend, Mr. Barton?

24:31.950 --> 24:33.212
No, this is different.

24:33.286 --> 24:36.255
All right, ma'am, look. The 911
line is for emergencies only.

24:36.322 --> 24:37.812
Real emergencies.

24:37.890 --> 24:39.517
This is an emergency!

24:39.592 --> 24:41.856
It's Mr. Lawrence.
He lives upstairs.

24:41.928 --> 24:43.396
He's gone crazy.

24:43.464 --> 24:44.863
It's Mr. Lawrence.

24:44.932 --> 24:46.559
He came downstairs
for a visit.

24:46.633 --> 24:48.601
He wanted some milk.
He loves milk.

24:48.669 --> 24:49.658
Yeah, I'm sure he does.

24:49.736 --> 24:51.897
Then all of a sudden,
he starts running around,

24:51.972 --> 24:55.136
knocking things over,
screeching, screaming.

24:55.210 --> 24:57.371
He tried to scratch
my eyes out!

24:57.445 --> 24:59.879
Uh-huh. Let me guess.
He's Persian?

25:00.014 --> 25:01.811
No. He's from Burma.

25:02.718 --> 25:04.515
Of course he is.

25:06.222 --> 25:07.951
What the hell have you
been feeding him?

25:13.897 --> 25:15.455
<i>So how's it going?</i>

25:15.532 --> 25:17.523
Oh, it's going great.
I love it.

25:17.601 --> 25:19.364
How are you, Detective?

25:19.436 --> 25:21.837
I'm doing great.
Couldn't be better.

25:21.906 --> 25:23.032
<i>You're back
in the saddle.</i>

25:23.107 --> 25:24.870
Absolutely.

25:24.942 --> 25:27.672
Back in the saddle.
Yeah.

25:28.513 --> 25:30.413
So what are you doing?

25:30.548 --> 25:31.846
Oh, busy, busy, busy.

25:31.917 --> 25:33.817
There's a big dinner tonight
at the Four Seasons.

25:33.886 --> 25:36.354
I called this morning, and they
didn't have a table for eight.

25:36.421 --> 25:37.615
<i>But they just
called back and said</i>

25:37.689 --> 25:39.714
<i>they could put
two smaller tables together.</i>

25:39.791 --> 25:41.157
Oh, that...

25:41.594 --> 25:43.585
Sounds like a hassle.

25:44.397 --> 25:46.888
But at least you got
a good story out of it.

25:46.966 --> 25:48.456
Right.

25:54.608 --> 25:56.303
Well, I have to go.

25:56.377 --> 25:58.607
<i>I have to proofread
some press releases.</i>

25:58.679 --> 26:00.648
But you take care
of yourself,

26:00.715 --> 26:03.115
Detective First Class
Adrian Monk.

26:03.451 --> 26:05.476
You too. Goodbye.

26:06.154 --> 26:07.212
Bye.

26:22.472 --> 26:24.030
How you doing?

26:33.451 --> 26:34.509
I don't see him.

26:34.586 --> 26:36.383
He's here somewhere.

26:36.654 --> 26:38.646
He's separated
the fruit salad.

26:41.760 --> 26:43.022
This way.

26:48.501 --> 26:50.799
There you are.
What are you doing?

26:50.870 --> 26:52.599
They don't have a dog.
Excuse me?

26:52.672 --> 26:54.435
Newspaper clipping
in DiMarco's hand.

26:54.507 --> 26:55.701
It was for dog food.

26:55.775 --> 26:56.868
Right, the coupon.

26:56.944 --> 26:59.504
So you think DiMarco
crossed the line.

26:59.580 --> 27:01.639
Monk,
we looked into it. Tell him.

27:01.716 --> 27:02.740
He's clean.

27:02.817 --> 27:04.944
I mean, at least so far.
His bank account checks out.

27:05.019 --> 27:06.647
He wasn't in debt.
No personal problems.

27:06.722 --> 27:08.212
We'll keep digging,
Monk, I promise,

27:08.290 --> 27:10.918
but in the meantime, you've
got to tread carefully here.

27:10.993 --> 27:13.393
Weaver's right.
You're not freelance anymore.

27:13.462 --> 27:16.728
If you're gonna accuse a cop of
something, it's got to be airtight.

27:16.799 --> 27:18.061
Hey, hey.

27:18.134 --> 27:20.796
My butt's on the line
here, too. Come on.

27:28.879 --> 27:31.177
Passport application.

27:33.751 --> 27:35.276
I said come on.

27:46.499 --> 27:47.966
Mrs. DiMarco.

27:48.734 --> 27:50.201
Mrs. DiMarco.

27:50.269 --> 27:52.567
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

27:52.938 --> 27:54.634
My name is
Adrian Monk.

27:54.708 --> 27:58.371
I'm a former detective. Actually
I'm a former former detective.

27:58.445 --> 28:02.006
Thank you for coming.
Did you work with Russell?

28:02.182 --> 28:04.617
I only met him once
at the station.

28:04.852 --> 28:07.719
We talked
about computers.

28:07.889 --> 28:11.154
I do have a couple of
questions. Is this a bad time?

28:11.359 --> 28:12.849
Is this a bad time?

28:12.927 --> 28:14.828
Just take a second.

28:14.930 --> 28:17.660
Were you and Russell
planning a vacation?

28:18.000 --> 28:19.058
Yes.

28:19.134 --> 28:20.362
To the Cayman Islands?

28:20.436 --> 28:21.425
That's right.

28:21.503 --> 28:24.337
Was that his idea?
To go to the Caymans?

28:24.741 --> 28:26.709
He wanted
to surprise me.

28:27.510 --> 28:29.205
He bought the tickets
last week.

28:29.279 --> 28:30.507
Oh, last week?

28:30.580 --> 28:32.343
Why the Caymans?

28:32.783 --> 28:34.978
Did he have
a bank account there?

28:35.052 --> 28:36.246
A bank account?

28:36.320 --> 28:37.309
Monk, what are
you doing?

28:37.388 --> 28:38.480
I'm just paying
my respects.

28:38.556 --> 28:39.648
He was a great guy.

28:39.724 --> 28:41.157
We're all
gonna miss him.

28:41.225 --> 28:42.250
Yeah.

28:42.327 --> 28:44.852
Did he ever say anything to
you about offshore accounts?

28:44.930 --> 28:46.397
Hiding money?

28:46.631 --> 28:47.859
What are you saying?

28:47.933 --> 28:50.800
Are you accusing
Russell of something?

28:50.869 --> 28:51.859
Oh, God!

28:51.938 --> 28:52.996
Hey, Captain,
you better get him

28:53.072 --> 28:54.539
the hell out of here
before we have to.

28:54.607 --> 28:56.234
Come on, I want
to show you something.

28:56.309 --> 28:58.038
What is it?
It's outside.

28:58.111 --> 28:59.237
What is it?

28:59.312 --> 29:00.779
It's you not
getting beat up.

29:00.847 --> 29:02.873
Oh, I'd like
to see that.

29:04.651 --> 29:07.620
I have to say I've been looking
forward to this all week.

29:07.688 --> 29:09.087
I've been thinking
about you.

29:09.156 --> 29:11.182
So, how does it feel?

29:11.459 --> 29:13.188
Good. I feel great.

29:13.261 --> 29:16.753
Yeah, well, it's not a gift,
you know, you earned it.

29:17.132 --> 29:18.292
Mmm-hmm.

29:18.366 --> 29:19.492
So...

29:22.805 --> 29:23.931
Are you happy?

29:24.006 --> 29:25.906
I'm very happy.

29:27.309 --> 29:29.334
Why wouldn't I be?

29:30.180 --> 29:34.344
This is what I've wanted
for years, you know?

29:38.755 --> 29:39.814
All right.

29:39.891 --> 29:41.415
Why do you ask that?

29:41.492 --> 29:43.551
I mean, you don't
think I'm happy?

29:43.628 --> 29:46.791
Oh, I didn't say that. No.
I wasn't implying. No.

29:46.864 --> 29:48.991
I'm not happy.
Are you happy?

29:53.238 --> 29:54.762
Nobody wants
to work with me.

29:54.840 --> 29:57.775
I can't choose
my own cases.

29:58.610 --> 30:00.511
The crazy cat lady
keeps calling,

30:00.580 --> 30:02.810
although it's not
always a cat.

30:04.250 --> 30:05.911
It's my dream job.

30:07.954 --> 30:10.082
And it's making me
miserable.

30:10.791 --> 30:13.589
I was afraid of this.

30:13.661 --> 30:15.925
You know, it's not
an uncommon reaction.

30:15.996 --> 30:19.626
People achieve a goal,
something they've always wanted,

30:19.801 --> 30:22.770
it's not always
what they expect.

30:22.838 --> 30:25.170
We call it
"aspirational regret. "

30:26.141 --> 30:27.666
See, when I was a kid,

30:27.743 --> 30:29.370
I wanted to go
to a baseball camp.

30:29.445 --> 30:30.776
That was my dream.
Baseball camp...

30:30.847 --> 30:33.509
Excuse me, could I
stop you right there?

30:33.583 --> 30:34.675
Sure.

30:38.088 --> 30:39.851
You have
something to say?

30:39.923 --> 30:40.947
No.

30:42.593 --> 30:44.288
"When the gods
wish to punish us,

30:44.361 --> 30:45.589
"they answer our prayers. "

30:45.662 --> 30:47.528
Oscar Wilde said that.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.524
I can't believe

30:51.436 --> 30:53.233
I was happy before.

30:54.672 --> 30:57.005
Why didn't you
tell me I was happy?

30:57.076 --> 30:59.340
Adrian,
you can always quit.

30:59.645 --> 31:01.112
I can't quit.

31:01.447 --> 31:03.540
Everybody
will understand.

31:03.716 --> 31:05.650
You've changed,
the department has changed.

31:05.719 --> 31:07.880
You've been your own boss
for 12 years.

31:07.954 --> 31:09.751
It's hard to go back.

31:12.392 --> 31:13.859
I can't quit.

31:32.147 --> 31:33.375
Ah, Sam.

31:33.482 --> 31:35.451
Oh, evening, Detective.

31:36.152 --> 31:37.483
What's in the box?

31:37.554 --> 31:39.488
Officer DiMarco's stuff.

31:39.556 --> 31:41.547
I cleaned out his locker.

31:41.858 --> 31:44.555
His wife's picking it up
in the morning.

31:46.230 --> 31:48.027
It breaks your heart.

32:08.754 --> 32:10.619
23, 24...

32:12.391 --> 32:13.416
26.

32:29.978 --> 32:33.039
<i>So, I write down
the license number.</i>

32:33.115 --> 32:36.516
<i>447 PCE.</i>

32:47.397 --> 32:48.796
Mr. Alvanov.

32:48.932 --> 32:50.092
Hello.

32:51.168 --> 32:52.635
My name is Adrian Monk.

32:52.703 --> 32:54.762
Hey, I can't
help you, my friend.

32:54.839 --> 32:55.965
I promise my accountant.

32:56.040 --> 32:58.065
I can't loan anybody
another nickel.

32:58.142 --> 32:59.905
Sir, I'm not here
to borrow money.

32:59.977 --> 33:03.345
I'm with the police department.
This'll just take a minute.

33:03.415 --> 33:06.612
Oh, police.
Oh. My friends.

33:06.685 --> 33:07.743
That's right.

33:07.819 --> 33:09.252
Hey, listen,
I'm running a little late.

33:09.321 --> 33:12.018
Can you
join me upstairs? Huh?

33:12.625 --> 33:15.856
Upstairs? No.
No, thank you.

33:15.962 --> 33:17.987
I'm waiting
for my partner.

33:18.064 --> 33:19.088
He's supposed to
meet me here.

33:19.165 --> 33:21.361
I'm surprised
you didn't quit your job

33:21.435 --> 33:22.993
when you collected
all that reward money.

33:23.070 --> 33:24.196
Oh, I did.

33:24.271 --> 33:26.330
I give two weeks' notice.

33:26.407 --> 33:29.866
Time for somebody to wash
my windows for a change, huh?

33:30.945 --> 33:33.812
Okay, so,
this is about what?

33:34.783 --> 33:36.080
All right.

33:36.151 --> 33:38.244
Fact is, Manny, I'm here
to arrest you for murder.

33:38.319 --> 33:39.378
Excuse me?

33:39.455 --> 33:40.444
You heard me.

33:42.058 --> 33:44.083
And who did I kill?

33:44.160 --> 33:45.627
Russell DiMarco.

33:45.695 --> 33:47.629
The police officer who
was shot last week.

33:47.697 --> 33:48.824
Russell...

33:48.899 --> 33:50.560
Are you gonna pretend
you didn't know him?

33:50.634 --> 33:52.124
You were on
the same softball team.

33:52.202 --> 33:55.296
I was at his house last week,
and I saw his team jacket.

33:55.372 --> 33:58.672
<i>Everyone at Main Street Deli,
this is for you guys.</i>

33:59.544 --> 34:02.513
Russell! Yeah, yeah.

34:03.181 --> 34:04.808
I knew him.

34:04.882 --> 34:07.043
But this proves what?

34:07.586 --> 34:09.213
Yeah. Right.

34:09.588 --> 34:13.045
Okay, I'll tell you later.
I'm not gonna repeat myself.

34:13.125 --> 34:15.252
All right? Let's just
wait for my partner.

34:15.327 --> 34:18.456
Oh, your partner
doesn't know about this?

34:18.531 --> 34:20.829
Not yet, no.
This is 415 Vinton?

34:20.900 --> 34:22.663
You haven't

34:22.735 --> 34:25.068
told anyone about this,
have you?

34:25.839 --> 34:27.431
Oh, is that him? There?

34:27.507 --> 34:28.600
Where?

34:38.253 --> 34:40.652
Hey, it's 9:30. Aren't you
meeting Monk somewhere?

34:40.722 --> 34:42.485
Oh, don't remind me.

34:42.690 --> 34:44.659
Another crackpot theory.

34:50.833 --> 34:52.460
Looking for this?

35:04.414 --> 35:06.542
Hey, why don't
you just jump?

35:06.618 --> 35:08.813
Three floors,
you'd only break your leg.

35:08.887 --> 35:09.911
No!

35:11.623 --> 35:12.681
No!

35:13.391 --> 35:15.792
Fourth floor,
broken back.

35:20.132 --> 35:21.656
Oops. Too late.

35:22.501 --> 35:24.093
Now, you're dead.

35:30.010 --> 35:31.637
How did you know?

35:33.647 --> 35:37.015
I saw DiMarco's
ticket book.

35:39.620 --> 35:42.418
You didn't
spot that serial killer.

35:42.523 --> 35:43.923
DiMarco did.

35:44.259 --> 35:46.124
<i>He solved the case.</i>

35:46.195 --> 35:48.925
<i>He spotted
the killer's car and realized</i>

35:49.064 --> 35:52.363
<i>he had just found the most
wanted man in California.</i>

35:52.434 --> 35:54.767
<i>But DiMarco
didn't care about fame.</i>

35:54.838 --> 35:56.738
<i>He was after the fortune.</i>

35:56.806 --> 35:58.433
<i>The reward money.</i>

35:58.641 --> 36:01.235
He had a problem, he
worked for the police force,

36:01.311 --> 36:06.272
which meant that he wasn't
eligible to collect the reward.

36:07.051 --> 36:08.814
<i>He needed a partner.</i>

36:09.053 --> 36:11.783
<i>A front man.
That's where you came in.</i>

36:11.990 --> 36:14.788
<i>And he told you
who the killer was,</i>

36:14.893 --> 36:17.919
<i>and all you had to do
was come up with a story</i>

36:18.063 --> 36:19.792
and collect the money.

36:19.865 --> 36:25.634
But you wanted the whole
reward, all to yourself.

36:27.607 --> 36:31.203
Well, not that it matters
much, but you're right.

36:31.545 --> 36:33.274
I think this'll do.

36:35.782 --> 36:39.980
You know, I don't know why you
insist to come up with me today.

36:40.420 --> 36:42.616
Accidents are
pretty common up here.

36:42.690 --> 36:44.419
It's very dangerous work.

36:44.492 --> 36:47.825
Especially
in such a high wind.

36:48.997 --> 36:51.489
What are you doing?

36:52.568 --> 36:55.230
I'm murdering you,
my friend!

37:01.745 --> 37:02.973
Upsy daisy.

37:03.046 --> 37:05.776
You make me
work for this, huh?

37:07.751 --> 37:08.740
Yeah.

37:09.687 --> 37:11.154
Okay. Ha!

37:18.195 --> 37:20.426
Thanks for dropping by, huh?

38:14.358 --> 38:15.689
Step back.

38:28.307 --> 38:29.604
You okay?

38:30.209 --> 38:31.767
He tried to kill me.

38:31.844 --> 38:33.402
Yeah, we know.
We were watching.

38:33.479 --> 38:36.278
And he killed DiMarco.
They were partners.

38:36.883 --> 38:38.510
They were planning
to split the reward money,

38:38.585 --> 38:41.281
but Mikel
got greedy.

38:42.889 --> 38:44.686
Nice work,
Detective.

38:48.763 --> 38:50.390
Former detective.

38:50.731 --> 38:52.289
Former former detective.

38:52.366 --> 38:54.892
Former former
former detective.

38:55.837 --> 38:58.135
Are you turning in
your badge?

38:58.440 --> 38:59.771
He has it.

39:11.921 --> 39:13.013
Dispatch.

39:13.089 --> 39:15.888
Yeah, get a...
Bring me rescue services.

39:26.654 --> 39:28.383
Sign here and here.

39:30.190 --> 39:31.555
This blood?

39:32.193 --> 39:33.490
Sorry it didn't
work out.

39:33.561 --> 39:34.585
I'm not.

39:34.663 --> 39:37.461
At least now I know
I'm not the man I was.

39:37.666 --> 39:38.758
Who is?

39:38.833 --> 39:39.822
So what are
you gonna do?

39:39.901 --> 39:40.993
I haven't decided.

39:41.069 --> 39:44.267
I'll either go home and brood
or go home and sulk.

39:44.674 --> 39:45.971
I'm leaning toward brooding.

39:46.042 --> 39:48.169
Well, when you leave,
use the west entrance.

39:48.244 --> 39:49.370
Why?

39:49.445 --> 39:50.742
Surprise.

39:51.315 --> 39:52.407
What is it?

39:52.482 --> 39:54.074
It's a surprise.

39:54.651 --> 39:56.050
Well, what is it?

39:56.119 --> 39:59.384
Well, if we told you, it wouldn't
be a surprise now, would it?

39:59.456 --> 40:01.948
No, I guess it wouldn't.
What is it?

40:03.261 --> 40:04.626
What is it?

40:16.875 --> 40:18.103
Natalie.

40:20.046 --> 40:21.877
Heard you might be
looking for an assistant.

40:23.216 --> 40:26.014
What about your job
with the big promoter?

40:26.152 --> 40:28.450
Oh, Jim Paxton can make
his own dinner reservations.

40:28.521 --> 40:30.251
He doesn't need me.

40:30.992 --> 40:32.584
I'm needed here.

40:38.900 --> 40:40.561
I pay $900 a week.

40:41.403 --> 40:43.064
I am not taking
a pay cut, Mr. Monk!

40:43.138 --> 40:44.230
Then you
shouldn't have quit.

40:44.306 --> 40:45.864
I didn't quit,
you let me go!

40:45.941 --> 40:47.932
Oh, God,
you make me mad!

40:50.613 --> 40:52.012
What are you
looking for?

40:52.081 --> 40:53.776
The Captain said
there'd be a surprise.

40:53.850 --> 40:56.751
I'm the surprise! I talked
to the Captain this morning.

40:56.819 --> 40:59.550
Oh, good. What, you're disappointed?

40:59.623 --> 41:00.681
No, I said,
"Oh, good. "

41:00.758 --> 41:02.658
Well, you sound disappointed.
What were you expecting?

41:02.726 --> 41:05.320
I thought it might be
Joey Heatherton.
