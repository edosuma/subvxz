00:58.759 --> 00:59.863
<i>Wardell.</i>

01:01.462 --> 01:02.770
I love you.

Well, I guess you didn't
think I was gonna make it,

01:12.439 --> 01:13.645
did you, Earl?

01:13.841 --> 01:15.514
Oh, Lord!
Help me, help me!

01:15.709 --> 01:17.848
Fuck me, Earl!
Fuck me now!

01:18.045 --> 01:19.991
I can't, I can't, I can't.

You fucking dog, Earl.

01:22.216 --> 01:24.696
Fuck me now!

01:27.688 --> 01:30.669
Go to sleep.

01:32.526 --> 01:35.132
Save me.

01:35.329 --> 01:38.742
Make all the ugly

04:17.557 --> 04:20.401
Oh, my word.
LaVonda, get in here.

04:20.627 --> 04:23.073
You are not gonna believe
this hoarder's house.

04:23.296 --> 04:27.244
I can't, I am late for my
hospital visitation duties.

04:27.467 --> 04:31.210
<i>And I am takin'... Meta

04:32.739 --> 04:36.084
Noleta, we gotta skedaddle!

04:36.309 --> 04:37.845
I can't find my ponytail!

04:38.045 --> 04:39.581
I wonder why.

04:39.813 --> 04:43.659
Brenda's house makes
Noleta's trailer look tidy.

04:43.850 --> 04:45.659
Collects dolls because
her daughter drowned

04:45.852 --> 04:47.763
when Brenda was
passed out drunk.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.023
Tragic.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.734
You know, I am just
glad to see you back

04:52.926 --> 04:54.530
in front of that TV.

04:54.728 --> 04:56.248
You've had your nose
stuck in the Bible

04:56.363 --> 04:58.240
for the last few months.

04:58.432 --> 04:59.502
You done?

04:59.700 --> 05:03.113
Mm, almost,
I had to take a break.

05:03.336 --> 05:06.340
Revelation scares
the dickens out of me.

05:06.540 --> 05:09.384
Barely slept last night.

05:09.576 --> 05:12.682
I just do not know what
possessed you to read

05:12.879 --> 05:15.052
the entire Bible cover to cover.

05:15.248 --> 05:17.057
I think I'd kill myself.

05:17.250 --> 05:20.857
Well, with Ty and Kyle flittin'
from one state to another

05:21.054 --> 05:23.694
gettin' gay married and,
coupled with that

05:23.890 --> 05:26.928
Supreme Court decision,
and now what's goin' on

05:27.127 --> 05:30.108
down at the church house,
I just needed

05:30.297 --> 05:32.743
to figure out same
things for myself.

05:32.933 --> 05:36.437
Seems to me if David can
have Bathsheba's husband

05:36.636 --> 05:37.808
killed in battle,

05:38.038 --> 05:39.881
so he can marry
that adulteratin',

05:40.073 --> 05:42.075
pregnant tramp,

05:42.275 --> 05:45.722
to add to his shit ton
of other wives,

05:45.912 --> 05:48.984
our nephew can marry
the one man that he loves.

05:49.216 --> 05:51.594
You're bein' too
hard on Bathsheba.

05:51.785 --> 05:55.426
David used his position as
king to have his way with her.

05:55.622 --> 05:58.432
Du not blame the victim.

05:58.625 --> 06:00.571
How is Noleta's mama?

06:00.761 --> 06:02.741
Tests still pending.

06:02.929 --> 06:06.741
They've narrowed it down
to either stomach cancer

06:06.933 --> 06:10.073
or a severe case of ptomaine,
which she might have gotten

06:10.270 --> 06:12.807
from her very own
leftover tuna casserole,

06:13.006 --> 06:14.781
which she left out all night.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.283
Ooh, in this heat.

06:16.476 --> 06:18.581
Mm, then she ate it
for breakfast.

06:18.779 --> 06:21.760
Shoo, Hortense knows
better than that.

06:21.948 --> 06:25.953
It's summer, and who eats
tuna casserole for breakfast?

06:26.153 --> 06:27.188
Hortense.

06:29.189 --> 06:31.863
Can I borrow a pack of
cigarettes? I'm runnin' low.

06:32.092 --> 06:34.766
Ves, but you pay
me back this time.

06:34.961 --> 06:38.841
They're so high now,
it ought to make us all quit.

06:39.032 --> 06:40.705
I'm gonna pray
Hortense has ptomaine

06:40.934 --> 06:43.175
instead of stomach cancer.

06:43.370 --> 06:45.008
I can't find my ponytail.

06:45.205 --> 06:47.685
You wanna borrow one
of my Raquel Welch wigs?

06:47.874 --> 06:49.478
No, that's all right,
I'll just rethink my look

06:49.676 --> 06:51.280
on my way over to visit Mama.

06:51.478 --> 06:52.980
You wouldn't have that
problem if you'd just

06:53.180 --> 06:54.682
chose a look and stick to it.

06:54.881 --> 06:56.519
That's right,
me and Sissy's hair has

06:56.716 --> 06:58.627
stood still for decades.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.339
We interrupt this program

07:00.520 --> 07:02.520
<i>to bring you the very
latest on a developing</i> story.

07:02.656 --> 07:05.466
<i>We have confirmed
that convicted serial killer</i>

07:05.659 --> 07:06.831
<i>Billy Joe Dotson...</i>

07:07.027 --> 07:08.904
Sweet baby Jesus,
he's that serial killer

07:09.129 --> 07:11.803
from over in Longview,
who picked up hitchhikers

07:11.998 --> 07:13.598
and killed 'em by
conkin' 'em on the head

07:13.733 --> 07:15.974
with a sledgehammer
he stole while workin'

07:16.169 --> 07:18.911
at a meat packin' plant
right over in Tyler.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.641
He is so hot.

07:20.841 --> 07:23.014
I guess I won't be
hitchhikin' anytime soon,

07:23.210 --> 07:24.490
or I'll end up in the graveyard.

07:24.544 --> 07:26.217
I might.

07:26.413 --> 07:31.556
Well, Mama, it's been
17 years since you died.

07:31.751 --> 07:36.359
The day you caused so much
chaos and all hell broke loose.

07:38.091 --> 07:42.039
My son came out as gay right
in front of your coffin.

07:42.229 --> 07:46.006
And is now legally
married to a black man.

07:46.199 --> 07:49.874
Thanks to
the U.S. Supreme Court.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.573
I'll give you a moment
to roll over in your grave.

07:55.008 --> 07:56.715
Oh, Mama,

07:56.910 --> 07:58.719
so much has happened.

08:00.247 --> 08:01.453
Wilson left me.

08:03.183 --> 08:04.856
Took my credit cards...

08:06.219 --> 08:07.562
my beautiful home.

08:09.222 --> 08:13.398
I had to move into
a 1,700-square-foot house,

08:13.593 --> 08:15.300
back here in Winters,
Texas, where there's

08:15.528 --> 08:18.566
a constant parade of crazy
dancin' in the street.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.773
♪ <i>You done me wrong
So I'm doing you right</i>

08:22.969 --> 08:26.280

oh, Peggy, Peggy, Peggy.

08:35.414 --> 08:40.091
17 years ago, these
sumbitches...

08:40.287 --> 08:42.631
Killed the love of my life.

08:42.822 --> 08:45.735
Well, now technically,
it wasn't them sumbitches,

08:45.926 --> 08:47.633
G.W., remember?

08:47.827 --> 08:50.808
Noleta burnt up them wooden
legs that killed Peggy.

08:50.997 --> 08:53.443
I know that, you idiot.

08:53.633 --> 08:55.078
You don't have to get nasty.

08:57.137 --> 09:00.016
Hey, look on the bright side.
At least you once had a wife,

09:00.240 --> 09:01.310
and a mistress.

09:03.343 --> 09:05.414
Some of us ain't
never found love.

09:05.612 --> 09:07.252
Maybe it's 'cause no
one wants you, Odell.

09:07.447 --> 09:09.518
You got that right.

09:09.749 --> 09:11.660
Goddamn it, half-wit.

09:11.851 --> 09:16.129
I was struck by lightning,
that's why I'm a little slow.

09:16.323 --> 09:18.530
Made you smarter, in my opinion.

09:20.293 --> 09:22.671
Princess Margaret was
Queen Elizabeth's sister

09:22.862 --> 09:25.672
and her former
daughter-in-law,

09:25.865 --> 09:27.674
Sarah Ferguson, is a duchess.

09:27.867 --> 09:31.371
And Prince Charles
had a mistress,

09:31.604 --> 09:33.277
Camilla Parker Bowles.

09:35.842 --> 09:38.015
And that's what killed Diana.

09:39.679 --> 09:41.488
Well, that's good
to know, Juanita.

09:41.681 --> 09:44.662
Well, I ain't never seen any
love in your life neither.

09:44.851 --> 09:47.024
Me and LaVonda had a good
thing goin' at one time.

09:47.220 --> 09:51.362
Yeah, till she dumped your ass,
like, a million years ago.

09:51.558 --> 09:56.337
Victory, that's a new one
I made up just right now.

09:56.529 --> 09:59.169
"V", for victory, you see.

09:59.366 --> 10:01.972
Looks like a big
hairless vagina to me.

10:02.168 --> 10:03.647
I don't like that.

10:03.837 --> 10:06.408
I got somethin' that'll
make you feel better, G.W.

10:06.639 --> 10:08.050
A bullet through my head?

10:08.241 --> 10:11.222
No, I'm puttin' back together
that 15-year tribute

10:11.411 --> 10:13.914
for Peggy that was suppose
to have two years ago.

10:14.147 --> 10:15.922
Got derailed by that
hail storm and Odell

10:16.149 --> 10:17.560
gettin' struck by lightning.

10:17.751 --> 10:20.595
And then last year, Juanita
went missin' for two days.

10:21.888 --> 10:23.390
Did you find me?

10:23.590 --> 10:25.030
You got locked in
the storage closet,

10:25.191 --> 10:27.398
passed out drunk from
tryin' each and every one

10:27.594 --> 10:28.902
of my liquors in there.

10:29.095 --> 10:32.440
Good times.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.842
I never should have tried
to catch them hail balls

10:36.036 --> 10:38.676
in my mouth, like peanuts.

10:38.872 --> 10:40.078
Error in judgment.

10:40.273 --> 10:43.015
We'll just make it
a 17-year anniversary.

10:43.209 --> 10:44.916
We can get together and
sing Peggy's favorite hymns

10:45.111 --> 10:46.419
just like the good old days.

10:46.613 --> 10:48.183
How's it gonna he
like the good old days

10:48.381 --> 10:52.193
when the love of my life,
Peggy, is six feet under?

10:52.385 --> 10:54.592
You can't kill love, G.W.,

10:55.755 --> 10:57.428
but love can kill you.

10:59.292 --> 11:01.135
And you don't want that.

11:04.097 --> 11:06.373
Did she just make sense?

11:06.566 --> 11:09.547
Well, even a blind hog finds
an acorn every now and then.

11:13.406 --> 11:16.876
Come to me, Tammy. I need you.

11:17.077 --> 11:20.081
Why don't you ever
come to me anymore?

11:22.949 --> 11:26.055
Well, shit,
she ain't a-comin'.

11:26.252 --> 11:28.789
I'm gonna call my Aunt Sissy.

11:28.988 --> 11:31.127
No, no, no, no...

11:31.324 --> 11:33.395
Oh, bless her heart.

11:39.566 --> 11:40.636
Hello.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.177
Hi, sissy,

11:42.402 --> 11:45.679
Oh, well, hello Brother Boy,
how are you, hun?

11:45.905 --> 11:48.181
<i>Oh, Sissy, I've been
havin' this dream.</i>

11:48.408 --> 11:50.820
My fantasies of Wardell
and I gettin' married

11:51.010 --> 11:52.853
have started up again.

11:53.079 --> 11:54.319
But it was a beautiful wedding,

11:54.447 --> 11:56.859
<i>and you were a bridesmaid.</i>

11:57.083 --> 11:59.188
Oh, thanks for askin' me.

12:00.920 --> 12:03.161
It was a dream, Sissy.

12:03.356 --> 12:08.362
But then, the dream turns into
an awful, awful nightmare.

12:08.595 --> 12:11.132
And the wedding
becomes Mama's funeral.

12:11.331 --> 12:14.210
<i>But Doctor Eve, you remember
that mean old store-bought</i>

12:14.434 --> 12:16.880
big-titty doctor who was
tryin' to de-homosexualize me

12:17.103 --> 12:18.309
at the loony bin?

12:18.505 --> 12:20.781
I do indeed,
I did not care for her.

12:20.974 --> 12:24.319
Yeah, well, Doctor Eve is
in Mama's coffin, not Mama.

12:24.511 --> 12:27.515
And she tries to get
him to well, to fu...

12:27.714 --> 12:30.126
To have carnal
relations with me.

12:30.316 --> 12:32.227
Right there in the church house?

12:32.452 --> 12:35.956
<i>Yes, in Mama's coffin.
It was so frightening.</i>

12:36.156 --> 12:37.692
<i>You do know what today's
date is, don't you?</i>

12:37.891 --> 12:38.961
Thursday.

12:39.159 --> 12:41.469
Ah, Mama's death date.

12:41.661 --> 12:43.538
She died 17 years ago.

12:43.730 --> 12:45.971
She's haunting me
because, Sissy, she never

12:46.166 --> 12:47.839
wanted me to be happy.

12:48.034 --> 12:51.538
Oh, sweet baby Jesus,
how time flies.

12:51.738 --> 12:55.208
Seems like just yesterday
that Peggy tripped over

12:55.408 --> 12:58.480
them wooden legs and hit her
head on that nasty old sink

12:58.678 --> 13:01.659
at the Galaxy Motel
while havin' that affair

13:01.848 --> 13:03.691
with G.W. Nethercott.

13:05.151 --> 13:06.494
Hello, sweet <i>boy.</i>

13:06.686 --> 13:09.098
Hey, Mama, I'm callin'
you from Dallas.

13:09.322 --> 13:12.496
Dallas, you're so close.

13:12.692 --> 13:14.763
Did you finish your, um,

13:14.994 --> 13:16.564
marriage tour thingamajig?

13:16.763 --> 13:19.505
Ves, ma'am, this last part
is what I like to call

13:19.699 --> 13:22.407
the "weeping and gnashing
of teeth" part of the tour.

13:22.602 --> 13:26.243
Uh-huh, well, y'all sure
did get a lot of press.

13:26.439 --> 13:27.918
That was the point.

13:28.107 --> 13:30.383
<i>Yes, great for your cause,</i>

13:30.577 --> 13:33.615
not always easy
on mothers in Winters, Texas.

13:33.846 --> 13:36.087
Well, I'm sorry that
exposing bigotry has caused

13:36.282 --> 13:38.057
you such grief, Mama.

13:38.251 --> 13:39.730
Oh, don't worry about it.

13:39.919 --> 13:42.195
I'm used to being gossiped
about by now,

13:42.388 --> 13:45.733
but how come you're in Dallas
and I'm just now findin' out?

13:45.925 --> 13:49.304
Kyle's up for a big job at
Mitchell Gold, Bob Williams,

13:49.529 --> 13:50.974
head design associate.

13:51.197 --> 13:53.234
<i>And he gets to choose
between Dallas and Atlanta.</i>

13:53.433 --> 13:55.242
Oh, choose Dallas.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.108
I could come up there and shop.

13:57.303 --> 13:59.408
Kyle gets family
discounts, right?

13:59.606 --> 14:02.052
I need a new chaise, in taupe.

14:02.242 --> 14:03.778
We'll get right on that.

14:03.977 --> 14:05.786
And you can visit Winters often.

14:05.979 --> 14:09.825
<i>Yes that would be,
just horrible.</i>

14:10.049 --> 14:15.158
Although, maybe we could make
Texas number 50, in Winters.

14:15.388 --> 14:16.748
And you could throw
us our wedding,

14:16.889 --> 14:18.596
<i>that would certainly
get lots of attention.</i>

14:18.791 --> 14:21.135
Oh, aren't these flowers pretty?

14:21.327 --> 14:23.273
<i>It's your nan-aunt's
death date.</i>

14:23.463 --> 14:25.340
<i>I'm in the cemetery
as we speak,.</i>

14:25.565 --> 14:28.409
I wish you were here but,
you'll always find a reason

14:28.601 --> 14:29.909
not to visit Winters.

14:30.103 --> 14:31.582
I just gave you a reason
for me to come home

14:31.771 --> 14:33.182
and you changed the subject.

14:33.406 --> 14:36.785
Oh, let's not fight, Ty.
You know I love you, I do,

14:36.976 --> 14:38.580
and I'm really happy
that you and Kyle

14:38.778 --> 14:41.520
have found each other.
I just, well,

14:41.748 --> 14:43.853
it's just not exactly

14:44.083 --> 14:46.859
the kind of wedding that
I always envisioned.

14:47.086 --> 14:49.692
Me neither, because I never
thought it was possible,

14:49.922 --> 14:51.162
because I was taught by you,

14:51.357 --> 14:53.098
and everybody else...

14:53.293 --> 14:55.330
Okay, you're right, you're
right, let's change the subject,

14:55.528 --> 15:00.307
um, 'cause I've been saving
the big news, and I mean big.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.947
Hey, Latrelle, what would
you prefer to be called,

15:04.137 --> 15:07.380
grandma, me-ma, nan-a,
or my personal favorite,

15:07.607 --> 15:10.053
because you're so
glamorous, glama?

15:10.276 --> 15:12.552
Wait, what?
Are you all...?

15:12.779 --> 15:15.623
Yes, our surrogate just
finished her first trimester

15:15.848 --> 15:18.158
and we wanted to wait,
you know, just to be sure,

15:18.351 --> 15:21.355
but you are going to
be a glama of twins.

15:22.822 --> 15:24.824
She's screaming.

15:25.024 --> 15:26.799
Good to see you, Mitchell.

15:26.993 --> 15:28.529
I gotta go, Mom.
Boss man just arrived.

15:28.728 --> 15:29.832
Hey, Mitchell. Bye, Mom.

15:30.029 --> 15:31.167
Oh, welcome.
Good to see you guys.

15:31.364 --> 15:32.844
- You too.
- Come on hack, let's talk.

15:33.032 --> 15:36.206
So I saw all the press
on the recent weddings.

15:36.402 --> 15:37.881
Perfect media attention.

15:38.071 --> 15:40.881
Faith in America. Great job,
Ty, that was incredible.

15:41.074 --> 15:43.486
And you, Kyle, what's it
gonna be, Dallas or Atlanta?

15:49.349 --> 15:53.593
I don't speak. I don't speak
gruntin', Aunt Little Neecy.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.734
Oh, hello there, Brother Boy.

15:59.926 --> 16:03.066
<i>LaVonda, I need your help.</i>

16:03.262 --> 16:05.606
My talents are
being wasted here in

16:05.832 --> 16:08.369
Long-fucking-view, Texas.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.912
I need you to rescue me.

16:11.104 --> 16:13.675
Uh-huh, well, did you hear
that the hitchhiker murderer

16:13.873 --> 16:15.011
has escaped the pen?

16:15.208 --> 16:17.552
<i>He is from Longview, you know.</i>

16:17.744 --> 16:19.917
<i>And he's killed people
all over that area.</i>

16:20.113 --> 16:21.854
Had sex with those he murdered.

16:22.048 --> 16:23.721
He's suppose to be
executed next week.

16:23.916 --> 16:26.692
LaVonda, please,
you know I frighten easily.

16:26.886 --> 16:29.765
I'm fragile as a
little baby kitten.

16:29.956 --> 16:32.527
And Mama's ghost is hauntin' me!

16:32.725 --> 16:35.433
It's not the good hauntin'
like when Tammy comes to me.

16:35.628 --> 16:37.232
It's the had hauntin'.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.808
And they've made, LaVonda,

16:40.032 --> 16:41.739
<i>this new drag queen</i>

16:41.934 --> 16:45.643
<i>head of the show,
and she has me on probation.</i>

16:45.872 --> 16:48.944
She's sayin' that
I have to give up Tammy.

16:49.142 --> 16:51.884
I have to give up Loretta,
and I have to give up Dolly.

16:53.045 --> 16:54.547
I'll have no show.

16:54.747 --> 16:56.283
<i>My new show is called...</i>

16:56.482 --> 16:59.986
<i>We Three Queens of Opry Are.</i>

17:00.219 --> 17:02.722
<i>I mean, who am I
suppose to do, LaVonda?</i>

17:02.922 --> 17:06.926
Carrie Underwood? Her kind of
Christianity frightens me.

17:07.126 --> 17:09.606
I mean, one minute she's
asking for Jesus

17:09.796 --> 17:12.742
ta please take the wheel,
and then the next minute

17:12.932 --> 17:15.310
she's heatin' out the
headlights of her cheatin'

17:15.501 --> 17:17.070
ex-boyfriend's truck.

17:18.905 --> 17:20.646
What about the other one?
Am I suppose to do her?

17:20.839 --> 17:22.979
The little fleshy,
the real sweet one,

17:23.175 --> 17:24.519
married to Blake Shelton.

17:24.743 --> 17:27.281
Miranda Lambert.
They're gettin' divorced,

17:27.480 --> 17:29.323
and she's lost weight.

17:29.515 --> 17:31.756
Well, I hadn't, I'm big as
Dallas and half of Fort Worth.

17:31.951 --> 17:34.591
I look like my water
is about to break.

17:34.787 --> 17:37.961
And I can't pull off
them young ones, LaVonda.

17:38.157 --> 17:40.467
I mean, you can just
dim the lights so low

17:40.660 --> 17:42.196
and then you're in the dark.

17:42.428 --> 17:44.430
<i>I need you to come get me.</i>

17:44.630 --> 17:46.610
Can you borrow Wardell's truck?

17:46.799 --> 17:50.372
And move me up tn Dallas
where opportunity is rampant?

17:52.605 --> 17:56.348
I heard about this bar LaVonda,
called the Rose Room.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.620
Seats 500 people.

18:01.948 --> 18:04.451
I need that kind
of appreciation.

18:04.650 --> 18:09.395
LaVonda, I need that
kind of applause.

18:09.622 --> 18:12.831
I need so much, LaVonda.

18:13.025 --> 18:15.335
I need my precious princess...

18:18.197 --> 18:19.801
Tammy!

18:41.821 --> 18:43.061
<i>Yoo-hoo!</i>

18:44.223 --> 18:45.361
Mrs. Barnes.

18:45.558 --> 18:48.334
On, uh.

18:48.528 --> 18:50.235
Hello, Latrelle.

18:50.429 --> 18:52.773
Well, you've gotta meet
the new preacher.

18:54.033 --> 18:57.207
Jimmy Ray!
Jimmy Ray, hey!

19:00.840 --> 19:04.617
Jimmy Ray Brewton,
he's my nephew,

19:04.844 --> 19:08.382
and he's gonna carry
on now that Cecil has...

19:08.581 --> 19:11.790
has gone on to glory
to meet Jesus.

19:12.018 --> 19:15.556
Jimmy Ray, this is
Latrelle Williamson.

19:15.755 --> 19:17.894
She's the one I told
you about with the son.

19:19.625 --> 19:21.468
Well, the Good Lord
sure did bless you

19:21.694 --> 19:23.469
with beauty, Latrelle.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.471
- Oh.
- Did indeed.

19:25.698 --> 19:28.907
Well, now, thank you.

19:29.101 --> 19:31.479
I have a question.

19:31.704 --> 19:35.447
Now that marriage equality
is the law of the land,

19:35.641 --> 19:40.112
how's this revival,
well, gonna change things?

19:40.313 --> 19:42.554
Supreme Court's not
the law of this land.

19:42.748 --> 19:44.284
Word of God's
the law of this land.

19:44.483 --> 19:46.895
Well, actually,
if memory serves me right,

19:47.086 --> 19:49.396
um, that's not exactly true.

19:49.589 --> 19:53.230
The Constitution is the law
of the land, not the Bible.

19:53.426 --> 19:55.929
Separation of Church and state,

19:56.128 --> 19:58.108
um, somethin' we all should
have been taught in school.

19:58.297 --> 20:00.641
She's a feisty one, ain't she?

20:00.833 --> 20:02.278
Indeed she is.

20:02.468 --> 20:03.628
Oh, I could tell you stories.

20:03.803 --> 20:06.283
And I'm sure you already have.

20:06.472 --> 20:09.817
Fact of the matter is,
five liberal justices

20:10.009 --> 20:13.456
and an ungodly Muslim president,

20:13.646 --> 20:15.319
can't take away my...

20:17.917 --> 20:20.864
your biblical
and constitutional right

20:21.087 --> 20:24.193
to live according to
your deeply held beliefs.

20:25.691 --> 20:28.001
Well, now, you've lost me,

20:28.194 --> 20:31.300
because as I said, it's the law.

20:31.497 --> 20:35.445
Well, that's true,
but as Christian warriors,

20:35.635 --> 20:37.706
we have to fight for our Lord.

20:37.937 --> 20:39.780
And here's your answer.

20:39.972 --> 20:42.976
<i>We are gonna make Runnels
County a sanctuary county</i>

20:43.175 --> 20:45.951
for the institution of
biblical marriage, one man,

20:46.145 --> 20:48.125
one woman, and to never
have a gay marriage

20:48.314 --> 20:49.816
performed in this county.

20:50.016 --> 20:53.020
Ever, ever.
We want our rainbow back.

20:53.219 --> 20:54.630
We do, indeed.

20:54.820 --> 20:57.801
And there have been
consequences to the moral decay

20:57.990 --> 20:59.833
of this country caused by
the gays and the acceptance

21:00.026 --> 21:01.972
of their lifestyle,
and there will be more.

21:02.161 --> 21:05.802
9/11, AIDS, Obana's
election, Hurricane Katrina.

21:05.998 --> 21:08.877
And Sandy. Oh, and don't
forget that Japanese tsunami.

21:09.068 --> 21:10.240
And fire ants.

21:10.469 --> 21:12.210
- All because of the gays.
- Um.

21:12.405 --> 21:15.477
Well, you know, I consider
myself a God-fearing Christian

21:15.675 --> 21:18.554
but I find it hard to
believe that the gays wield

21:18.744 --> 21:21.190
enough power to
control the weather,

21:21.380 --> 21:23.724
and disease, and insects.

21:23.916 --> 21:27.830
Well, allow me to
correct you here, you see,

21:28.020 --> 21:32.730
God has the power to respond
appropriately to immorality.

21:32.925 --> 21:35.098
And it's our responsibility
to protect this county

21:35.327 --> 21:36.362
from his wrath.

21:38.831 --> 21:44.281
Well, things become a little
cloudy and complicated when...

21:47.073 --> 21:50.384
I'm sure you've been
told that my son is gay.

21:51.911 --> 21:53.754
Yes, I have heard that.

21:55.247 --> 21:57.727
And I'm so, so sorry.

21:57.917 --> 22:01.057
That cross must be so
hard for you to carry.

22:01.253 --> 22:02.926
Now you just might
need this revival

22:03.122 --> 22:05.295
more than anybody in this town.

22:06.926 --> 22:09.805
Why don't you come by
on Friday, Latrelle,

22:10.029 --> 22:12.771
and I promise you
that everything will become...

22:13.032 --> 22:14.568
crystal clear.

22:16.469 --> 22:17.607
<i>Hm.</i>

22:19.805 --> 22:21.648
You know what?

22:21.874 --> 22:22.909
I think I will.

22:23.109 --> 22:24.486
I just can't come right now.

22:24.710 --> 22:26.314
I'm here at the
hospital sittin' with

22:26.545 --> 22:28.218
Evelyn Crawley's
Aunt Little Neecy.

22:28.414 --> 22:31.054
Aunt Little Neecy who used
to have all them feral cats?

22:31.250 --> 22:32.388
And a pet skunk.

22:32.585 --> 22:34.292
<i>Why, I thought she died.</i>

22:34.487 --> 22:36.057
<i>She was old when we were kids.</i>

22:36.255 --> 22:39.429
And why are you sittin'
with the afflicted?

22:39.625 --> 22:41.798
LaVonda, that is so unlike you.

22:41.994 --> 22:44.133
Evelyn has had somethin'
on me for years,

22:44.330 --> 22:45.809
which I do not want to discuss,

22:45.998 --> 22:48.501
and she has just been
waitin' to collect.

22:48.734 --> 22:50.509
What's wrong with
Aunt Little Neecy

22:50.736 --> 22:53.239
besides meanness and insanity?

22:53.439 --> 22:56.784
Well, Evelyn was in her
kitchen, picklin' okras

22:56.976 --> 22:58.956
from her garden,
and she put Aunt Little Neecy

22:59.145 --> 23:01.318
in front of the television,
to keep her occupied,

23:01.514 --> 23:02.834
and tn keep her
from goin' through

23:02.982 --> 23:04.620
her underwear drawer again.

23:04.817 --> 23:06.592
<i>I mean, she's just obsessed
with Evelyn's underwear,</i>

23:06.786 --> 23:08.163
<i>likes to try every
one of 'em on.</i>

23:08.354 --> 23:10.994
Oh, there's nothin'
crazy about that.

23:11.190 --> 23:13.636
Uh, well it, it,
stretches them out.

23:13.826 --> 23:15.203
Oh.

23:15.427 --> 23:17.805
Anyway, Aunt Little
Neecy just loves that show

23:17.997 --> 23:19.340
where the sponges talk.

23:19.532 --> 23:21.512
I mean, whoever came
up with that show

23:21.700 --> 23:23.839
had to be on drugs,
if you ask me.

23:24.036 --> 23:26.539
<i>So Evelyn looks up at
the clock on the stove...</i>

23:26.772 --> 23:30.117
Tammy, honey, is this as
boring to you as it is to me?

23:30.309 --> 23:33.153
The Price <i>Is</i> Right,
although, <i>Lord,</i> she was pissed

23:33.345 --> 23:36.155
<i>when Bob Barker quit,
and hates Drew Carey,</i>

23:36.382 --> 23:37.952
who looks better fat.

23:38.150 --> 23:40.528
Anyway, she goes in there and
tries to change the channel

23:40.719 --> 23:43.290
on the TV, and that's
when the trouble started.

23:43.489 --> 23:45.833
That is a lot of
detail, LaVonda.

23:46.025 --> 23:47.663
Oh, hush. You asked.

23:47.860 --> 23:50.170
And I listened to
your sob sister story

23:50.362 --> 23:51.397
for 30 fuckin' minutes.

23:51.630 --> 23:54.201
Okay, okay, proceed.

23:54.400 --> 23:56.243
<i>Well, it became a
battle over that remote.</i>

23:56.468 --> 24:00.177
Evelyn could not pry that remote
out of Aunt Little Neecy's hand,

24:00.372 --> 24:01.646
grip of death.

24:01.841 --> 24:04.253
And during the
struggle that remote

24:04.476 --> 24:06.353
landed upside Evelyn's head.

24:06.545 --> 24:08.024
Well, that did it.

24:08.214 --> 24:11.218
Evelyn lost her temper,
and Little Neecy lost hers.

24:11.417 --> 24:13.863
<i>So, right in the middle
of Aunt Little Neecy's</i>

24:14.053 --> 24:15.088
<i>big old temper tantrum,</i>

24:15.321 --> 24:16.732
she goes into a full-blown

24:16.922 --> 24:19.596
epileptic seizure and
bit off her tongue.

24:19.825 --> 24:21.236
Bit off her tongue?

24:21.427 --> 24:22.997
- Yes.
- Lord.

24:23.195 --> 24:25.106
Evelyn had to put
that bit-off tongue

24:25.331 --> 24:28.107
in the pickle jar she was
usin' for puttin' up her okra.

24:28.334 --> 24:30.439
Dumped that good okra
right in the sink,

24:30.669 --> 24:32.580
packed that jar with ice.

24:32.771 --> 24:34.079
Quick thinkin'.

24:34.273 --> 24:36.253
<i>Sure was, and she got
Aunt Little Neecy here</i>

24:36.442 --> 24:38.046
<i>to the hospital,
where Dr. Lloyd</i>

24:38.244 --> 24:40.781
<i>was able to reattach
that bit-off tongue.</i>

24:41.013 --> 24:43.186
But all that blood
just ruined Evelyn's

24:43.382 --> 24:45.521
brand-new white carpet,
indoor, outdoor.

24:45.718 --> 24:48.221
But Evelyn says that
the good news is

24:48.420 --> 24:50.229
<i>that the doctors say
that Aunt Little Neecy</i>

24:50.422 --> 24:52.902
<i>will speak again,
with speech therapy,</i>

24:53.092 --> 24:56.232
<i>which in my humble
opinion is not good news,</i>

24:56.428 --> 24:59.432
<i>'cause that crazy old bat
never fuckin' shuts up.</i>

24:59.632 --> 25:02.738
And, I strongly believe
that Evelyn will regret

25:02.935 --> 25:04.437
packin' that tongue on ice.

25:04.637 --> 25:06.981
What does Evelyn
have on you, anyway?

25:07.206 --> 25:10.881
Well, it has to do with her
witnessing a justified crime

25:11.076 --> 25:15.252
that I was an accomplice to
years ago, involving a goat.

25:15.447 --> 25:17.222
Oh, my God, was it sexual?

25:17.416 --> 25:18.451
No!

25:18.651 --> 25:20.756
And that is all
you need to know.

25:20.953 --> 25:24.400
Well, Evelyn was just plain
stupid buyin' that white carpet.

25:24.590 --> 25:26.763
But LaVonda, honey,

25:26.959 --> 25:28.597
I'm desperate.

25:28.794 --> 25:30.933
I need for you to drive here

25:31.130 --> 25:32.575
<i>And take me to Dallas.</i>

25:32.765 --> 25:34.574
Uh-oh, she's throwin'
things. I gotta go.

25:34.767 --> 25:35.905
Come get me, LaVon!

25:39.171 --> 25:41.617
What took you so long?

25:41.807 --> 25:45.414
Did you bring me my Payday,
and my flamingo-pink lipstick?

25:45.611 --> 25:49.423
I mean, the nurses,
the orderlies, the new preacher,

25:49.615 --> 25:52.494
they had to look at me all
day without my lips on.

25:52.685 --> 25:53.925
Yes, ma'am, I'm sorry.

25:54.119 --> 25:55.462
Oh, just give me my lipstick.

25:55.654 --> 25:58.999
If I'm going to die,
I want to look presentable.

26:00.159 --> 26:02.036
Oh, just cremate me.

26:02.261 --> 26:05.765
I mean, you would never be
able to do these eyebrows.

26:05.965 --> 26:08.036
Mama, you are not going to die.

26:09.501 --> 26:11.811
Stomach cancer
runs in this family.

26:12.004 --> 26:13.950
You're probably
gonna die of it too.

26:14.139 --> 26:16.278
Just give me my
lipstick and my Payday.

26:16.475 --> 26:17.886
Okay, oh, there it is.

26:18.110 --> 26:19.521
- Oh, kill it.
- Oh, Payday.

26:19.712 --> 26:20.782
Payday, good.

26:20.980 --> 26:22.118
- Lipstick.
- Ah-ha,

26:22.314 --> 26:24.351
and quit eating.

26:24.550 --> 26:27.156
You'll never get
another man at your size.

26:27.353 --> 26:28.388
Mama, I'm a size 10.

26:28.620 --> 26:31.157
In what country?

26:33.058 --> 26:35.299
I am not gonna let you
push my buttons, Mama.

26:35.494 --> 26:36.700
You may have installed them,

26:36.895 --> 26:38.568
but I'm not gonna
let you push 'em.

26:38.797 --> 26:40.970
I heard that on
Oprah's Lifeclasses.

26:41.166 --> 26:42.338
Oh, shut up.

26:42.534 --> 26:44.036
Oprah's full of shit.

26:45.871 --> 26:49.648
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I am going to see

26:49.842 --> 26:54.222
if they have your pending test
back to see how much longer

26:54.413 --> 26:57.223
I am going tn have to
put up with this shit!

26:57.416 --> 27:01.091
Which Oprah is not full of.

27:01.320 --> 27:03.596
LaVonda, LaVonda!

27:03.822 --> 27:05.733
No yelling in the hallways!

27:05.891 --> 27:07.768
There are sick people in here.

27:07.993 --> 27:10.234
Didn't your mother teach
you to be considerate?

27:10.429 --> 27:12.170
No, ma'am, she just
taught me to feel

27:12.364 --> 27:13.707
inferior and worthless.

27:13.899 --> 27:16.209
- LaVonda!
- Trash.

27:16.402 --> 27:19.212
Hey, there, pretty lady,
could you come in here?

27:19.405 --> 27:21.112
Me?

27:21.340 --> 27:24.014
Well, I don't see no
other pretty lady nearby.

27:24.209 --> 27:26.450
Hey, would you be an
angel and hand me...

27:26.678 --> 27:28.248
hand me them
crutches over there?

27:28.447 --> 27:30.290
Goddamn mean nurse
helped me into this chair

27:30.516 --> 27:32.553
and told me she'd be
back in 30 minutes.

27:32.751 --> 27:34.230
Been over an hour.

27:34.420 --> 27:37.230
Oh, damnation,

27:37.423 --> 27:38.527
You're pretty.

27:38.724 --> 27:39.930
Uh?

27:40.125 --> 27:41.968
Oh, and I don't
see no wedding ring.

27:42.194 --> 27:43.730
No. No more. No ring.

27:43.929 --> 27:47.069
I pawned it after my divorce
17 years ago. Single!

27:47.266 --> 27:49.506
See, my husband had an affair
on me with my best friend's

27:49.601 --> 27:51.911
70-year-old mother,
and our friendship survived

27:52.104 --> 27:53.549
but the marriage did not.

27:53.739 --> 27:55.776
My friend LaVonda,
oh, that's Peggy's daughter,

27:55.974 --> 27:57.749
Peggy is the old
adulteratin' dead woman,

27:57.943 --> 27:59.463
is settin' in that
room across from you

27:59.578 --> 28:01.387
with Evelyn Crawley's
Aunt Little Neecy.

28:01.580 --> 28:04.561
Well, Aunt Little Neecy is crazy
as a sack full of assholes,

28:04.750 --> 28:06.423
bless her heart.

28:06.618 --> 28:08.996
And I'm here visitin' my mama,
who either has stomach cancer

28:09.221 --> 28:10.825
or a severe case of ptomaine.

28:11.056 --> 28:12.729
I mean, we're prayin'
that it's ptomaine,

28:12.925 --> 28:13.960
but she is so damn mean

28:14.159 --> 28:15.559
sometimes I just wish
she would die.

28:15.727 --> 28:18.230
Oh, shout, I meant
to just think that.

28:18.430 --> 28:21.411
My husband, G.W., well
my ex-husband now,

28:21.600 --> 28:24.240
17 years, no ring, single,

28:24.436 --> 28:26.006
he is a Vietnam vet

28:26.238 --> 28:27.478
and he has two wooden legs.

28:27.673 --> 28:29.482
Well, technically
they're fiberglass.

28:29.675 --> 28:32.417
And one day I got real mad,
and I took one of them legs,

28:32.611 --> 28:35.353
and I bashed in all the
windows on his pickup truck

28:35.581 --> 28:36.924
while he was takin' a bath.

28:37.116 --> 28:39.096
Not a pretty sight with
them stubs, years ago.

28:39.284 --> 28:43.323
Then, I set them legs an fire
in the bed of his pickup truck,

28:43.522 --> 28:46.128
beings as I was so upset
after Peggy's funeral,

28:46.325 --> 28:47.998
you know about the
affair, not her death.

28:48.193 --> 28:50.935
But first, I soaked
them legs in gasoline,

28:51.130 --> 28:52.871
'cause I think that
shit through,

28:53.098 --> 28:54.634
tossed in a match, boom!

28:54.833 --> 28:58.474
Oh, it's hard to make a
marriage work after that.

28:58.670 --> 29:00.650
Remind me never to piss you off.

29:00.839 --> 29:02.682
Okay.

29:02.875 --> 29:05.014
I, uh, I don't mean
to make it worse.

29:05.210 --> 29:08.657
What...
What happened to your leg?

29:08.847 --> 29:11.487
Well, I crushed it
workin' on an oil rig.

29:11.683 --> 29:13.822
Uh, my crutches.

29:14.019 --> 29:16.363
Oh, right, sorry.

29:16.555 --> 29:17.625
Okay, here you go.

29:17.823 --> 29:19.860
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

29:20.058 --> 29:22.231
Now, hey, will you
get behind me,

29:22.461 --> 29:24.498
put both your hands

29:24.696 --> 29:27.643
around my waist and
give me a shove up?

29:27.833 --> 29:29.574
<i>Okay.-</i>

29:32.704 --> 29:34.650
Don't look at my ass.

29:34.840 --> 29:35.910
Okay.

29:36.141 --> 29:38.018
There we go.

29:38.210 --> 29:40.315
Oh, yay, it worked.

29:40.512 --> 29:43.493
My buddy Hank's suppose
to bring me some sweats but,

29:43.682 --> 29:45.355
- are you lookin' at my ass?
- No!

29:45.551 --> 29:47.326
Well, maybe just a little.

29:47.519 --> 29:48.554
Good.

29:50.022 --> 29:51.092
Oh, Lord!

29:51.323 --> 29:53.325
"Come, Lord Jesus.

29:53.525 --> 29:55.436
"The grace of the Lord Jesus

29:55.661 --> 29:58.073
be with all. Amen."

30:01.099 --> 30:02.373
<i>Hm.</i>

30:04.436 --> 30:06.541
Well, it's not the best
endin', if you ask me.

30:10.576 --> 30:13.182
Corner Stop, where
Jesus is alive and well

30:13.378 --> 30:15.915
and everything is
convenient. This is Vera.

30:16.114 --> 30:18.060
How may I help you?

30:18.250 --> 30:22.460
Hello, Vera, well,
I just now finished

30:22.688 --> 30:25.692
readin' the entire Bible.

30:25.891 --> 30:29.771
I've been dealin' with
Brother Boy this morning, ooh!

30:29.962 --> 30:32.203
More troubles than
Christ on the cross.

30:32.397 --> 30:34.877
Well, bless his heart.

30:35.067 --> 30:38.480
I've been praying for
Jesus to turn him straight.

30:38.704 --> 30:43.813
Well, Vera, I think that
perhaps that is a wasted prayer.

30:44.042 --> 30:47.615
If you have faith the
size of a mustard seed,

30:47.813 --> 30:50.657
you can say to a mulberry
tree, "Be uprooted

30:50.882 --> 30:52.452
and he planted in the sea."

30:52.651 --> 30:54.460
That's in Luke.

30:54.653 --> 30:56.963
Hey, Leticia, you're
mixin' up the sweet spicy

30:57.155 --> 31:00.227
chili Doritos with
the spicy nachos again.

31:00.425 --> 31:03.304
Yes, Vera! Bitch...

31:03.495 --> 31:07.068
<i>"Be ye kind, one to another.
" Ephesians 4:32.</i>

31:07.266 --> 31:09.746
Mm, uh-huh, that's
one of my favorites.

31:09.935 --> 31:12.848
Why do you think anybody
would want to uproot

31:13.071 --> 31:17.019
a mulberry tree
and plant it in the sea?

31:17.242 --> 31:19.688
How would they pick
their mulberries?

31:21.179 --> 31:23.181
Mm, there are some
things in the Bible

31:23.415 --> 31:26.259
that just do not make
a lick of sense to me.

31:26.451 --> 31:28.362
Well, I live by the Bible,
Sissy.

31:28.587 --> 31:30.464
I don't need it to make sense.

31:30.656 --> 31:32.135
Now I'm gonna need you on my

31:32.324 --> 31:34.804
anti-equality calling committee.

31:34.993 --> 31:36.438
<i>The revival starts tomorrow,</i>

31:36.628 --> 31:38.028
<i>and we gotta get
the final word out.</i>

31:38.130 --> 31:40.007
They're comin' for
our religious freedoms,

31:40.198 --> 31:42.200
and good Christians
are bein' persecuted.

31:42.434 --> 31:43.879
3'! who?

31:44.102 --> 31:46.810
Obama, Hillary Clinton,
five liberal judges,

31:47.005 --> 31:48.040
and Miley Cyrus.

31:48.273 --> 31:49.980
Sissy!

31:51.109 --> 31:53.020
Sissy!

31:53.211 --> 31:56.658
Oh, Lord, Vera, I gotta go.
It's Latrelle.

31:58.183 --> 31:59.355
Sissy!

32:03.121 --> 32:04.191
Sissy!

32:05.824 --> 32:07.264
Well, you're just
never gonna believe

32:07.326 --> 32:08.926
what the church is doing,
you just won't.

32:09.061 --> 32:10.369
Vera told me...

32:10.562 --> 32:12.371
They're havin' an
anti-equality revival.

32:12.564 --> 32:14.976
That's what they're callin'
it. It starts tomorrow.

32:15.167 --> 32:18.979
I just met the new
preacher, Jimmy Ray Brewton.

32:19.171 --> 32:20.241
He's handsome.

32:21.406 --> 32:22.544
Very argumentative.

32:22.741 --> 32:25.051
Well, you'd know all about that.

32:25.243 --> 32:28.486
That's nut always a bad thing.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.353
Oh, wait a minute.
I just hung up from Ty.

32:30.549 --> 32:33.393
He and Kyle may be
movin' to Dallas.

32:33.585 --> 32:35.997
Kyle's got a big designer
job offer from Mitchell Gold,

32:36.188 --> 32:40.762
Bob Williams, furniture
store, very upscale.

32:40.992 --> 32:43.165
High end. Gorgeous.

32:44.663 --> 32:46.506
Maybe you can get
some free furniture.

32:49.067 --> 32:50.444
Oh, the bigger news.

32:51.870 --> 32:53.110
The boys are havin' twins.

32:53.338 --> 32:55.511
Oh, twins.

32:55.707 --> 32:57.414
I gotta tinkle.

32:59.244 --> 33:00.780
What's wrong with my furniture?

33:03.515 --> 33:04.619
LaVonda.

33:05.951 --> 33:07.055
LaVonda.

33:07.252 --> 33:09.357
This is Hardy.
Hardy, this is LaVonda.

33:09.554 --> 33:11.192
Hardy's new in town.

33:11.390 --> 33:15.031
And who are you,
the welcome wagon?

33:15.227 --> 33:17.070
Are you two smokin'
in the hospital?

33:17.262 --> 33:18.866
Oh, yeah, we were smokin'.

33:19.064 --> 33:20.737
I gotta go,
I'm gonna be late for work.

33:20.899 --> 33:22.310
We're not done here, okay?

33:22.534 --> 33:24.070
Okay, ow!

33:24.269 --> 33:27.307
Why don't anything good like
this ever happen to my life?

33:27.539 --> 33:29.746
Did you see the
size of his feet?

33:29.941 --> 33:31.648
I sure did, come on.

33:34.746 --> 33:39.456
So they both do their business
in a cup instead of a sock,

33:39.651 --> 33:41.756
and it goes to some
science lab where it then

33:41.953 --> 33:46.129
fertilizes some
stray woman's eggs

33:46.324 --> 33:49.237
that they choose from
a book of donors.

33:49.428 --> 33:52.637
Then the fertilized eggs
are put into the surrogate's

33:52.831 --> 33:55.744
uterus, that will
then carry the babies.

33:55.934 --> 33:58.175
Was very scientific.

33:58.403 --> 34:02.408
Ew, Lordy, Lordy, the
things they can do these days.

34:02.607 --> 34:07.488
They use this agency
called Growing Generations,

34:07.679 --> 34:10.319
that did every thing,
put every thing together.

34:10.514 --> 34:12.495
And that oldest
Winkler girl just had her

34:12.684 --> 34:14.789
fourth baby out of wedlock.

34:14.985 --> 34:18.024
They could have just
slipped her a 20 and

34:18.255 --> 34:19.456
had a little white trash baby.

34:19.591 --> 34:21.195
No, thank you.

34:21.426 --> 34:23.804
I do not want a
Winkler grandchild.

34:23.995 --> 34:26.873
No tellin' what's swimmin'
in that gene pool.

34:27.098 --> 34:29.772
Besides, they wanted their own.

34:29.967 --> 34:32.539
And with today's
technology, each one

34:32.771 --> 34:35.012
can have their very
own biological child.

34:35.206 --> 34:38.210
Oh, one white one,

34:38.443 --> 34:40.946
and one cute little mulatto.

34:41.146 --> 34:43.489
Ew, I hope the
mulatto one is a girl.

34:43.715 --> 34:45.558
Halle Berry is so beautiful.

34:46.784 --> 34:49.822
Sissy that word, "mulatto,"

34:50.021 --> 34:52.558
it's no longer
politically correct.

34:52.791 --> 34:54.862
"Mixed" is preferred.

34:55.060 --> 34:56.197
Mixed, huh?

34:57.362 --> 34:59.706
Well, if you say so.

34:59.898 --> 35:02.845
Mulatto sure has a
prettier ring to it.

35:03.034 --> 35:05.207
Lord, I cannot keep up.

35:06.705 --> 35:09.709
Is African-American still right?

35:09.908 --> 35:11.751
I believe so,
only there are some

35:11.977 --> 35:14.082
who don't care for that either.

35:14.312 --> 35:17.418
Oh, I cannot wait to tell
mid-life crises Wilson

35:17.649 --> 35:19.560
that he's gonna be a grandpa.

I'm working on a transition
from Tammy into Loretta.

36:08.199 --> 36:12.045
It's part of a skit
I come up with.

And those beautiful
princes, William and Harry,

36:38.396 --> 36:39.807

Tragic, Juanita.

36:50.642 --> 36:53.486
- Hey, G.W., Odell, hi, Wardell.
- Hi, Vonnie.

36:53.678 --> 36:55.624
Are you all doin'
all this for my mama?

36:55.814 --> 36:58.818
Yep, and I'd like for
you to come tomorrow night

36:59.017 --> 37:02.157
as my date, for old times' sake.

37:02.354 --> 37:05.130
- I think I'd like that.
- Yeah.

37:05.323 --> 37:09.829
I'm Earl. Folks just

37:27.779 --> 37:30.123
Oh, bisexual, huh?

37:39.491 --> 37:40.629
What?

37:40.825 --> 37:42.202
Just wanted to
pass and say howdy.

37:42.394 --> 37:43.464
What's up?

37:43.662 --> 37:45.573
Well, Mama's in the hospital,

37:45.797 --> 37:47.572
either stomach
cancer or ptomaine.

37:47.799 --> 37:50.507
And she told me I'd never
get another man at my size.

37:50.702 --> 37:52.648
Then right after she
said that, I got laid

37:52.837 --> 37:55.408
by a younger man,
hot as hell, with both legs

37:55.640 --> 37:56.710
in a hospital bed.

37:56.908 --> 37:59.218
Mama was wrong.

37:59.411 --> 38:02.255
So what's up with you,
G.W., stayin' busy?

38:06.518 --> 38:10.364
52.09, 52.09, 52.09,

52.09, 52.09 and 52.09.

38:21.266 --> 38:22.386
Will there he anything else?

38:22.567 --> 38:26.208
Uh-uh.
No, ma'am, no, no, no.

38:26.404 --> 38:29.408
For that, I can't even
afford to eat anymore.

38:29.607 --> 38:31.678
Have you given any more
thought to bein'

38:31.876 --> 38:34.186
on my anti-equality
calling committee?

38:34.379 --> 38:35.414
Well...

38:35.613 --> 38:37.388
Sissy, would you
buy me this Baby Ruth?

38:37.582 --> 38:39.789
I had a craving for
somethin' sweet.

38:40.018 --> 38:43.227
Well, hello, Latrelle.

38:43.421 --> 38:46.527
I heard that your ex-husband
has been shackin' up

38:46.725 --> 38:48.525
with a much, much younger
more beautiful woman

38:48.626 --> 38:50.628
in your former
mini-mansion that you lost

38:50.862 --> 38:53.706
in the divorce
over in St. Angelo.

38:53.898 --> 38:55.309
How you holdin' up?

38:56.568 --> 38:58.912
I'm fine, Vera, thank you.

38:59.104 --> 39:01.424
Well, you've been on my prayer
list ever since your husband

39:01.606 --> 39:04.917
ran off with that
mulatto IHOP waitress.

39:05.110 --> 39:06.817
Prayers mean so much.

39:07.045 --> 39:10.424
"Mulatto" is no longer
politically correct, Vera.

39:10.615 --> 39:13.425
They prefer "mixed" these days.

39:13.618 --> 39:16.758
And I've been prayin' for
you, and your struggle with

39:16.955 --> 39:20.232
obesity, and gluttony too.

39:20.425 --> 39:23.338
You have faith,
you can move a mountain.

39:25.163 --> 39:28.167
Shut up, Leticia.
Go dust the sauce or you'll be

39:28.399 --> 39:29.439

39:31.903 --> 39:34.474
I don't speak Mexican!

39:34.672 --> 39:36.845
And I am not a glutton,

39:37.075 --> 39:38.748
I have glandular problems.

39:38.943 --> 39:41.446
Oh, Vera has struggled
so with her weight battle

39:41.646 --> 39:43.956
ever since we were kids.

39:44.149 --> 39:47.926
Dr. Oz says it's a disease,
just like bein' an alcoholic.

39:48.119 --> 39:51.430
Well, then perhaps it's
time for you to get sober.

39:52.824 --> 39:55.464
People don't like you, Latrelle.

39:55.660 --> 39:57.196
Yes.

39:57.428 --> 40:01.342

we have in common, Vera.

40:01.533 --> 40:03.012

40:05.170 --> 40:06.274
Oh!

40:06.471 --> 40:08.382

40:09.774 --> 40:12.778
I know what that
teardrop tattoo means.

40:12.977 --> 40:15.856
It means you been in the pokey.

40:16.047 --> 40:18.323
Uh, damn, I needed that.

40:18.516 --> 40:20.052

40:27.192 --> 40:30.332

44:21.926 --> 44:24.099
I just can't!

44:24.295 --> 44:25.774
You will if I say you will.

44:25.963 --> 44:28.409
No, no, no, Dr. Eve!
Get out of my head!

44:28.599 --> 44:31.876
Stop, just go, go, go,
go, go, no, no, go.

44:32.070 --> 44:34.311
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm your new boss,

44:34.539 --> 44:36.041
the one who had no
say in hiring you,

44:36.240 --> 44:37.583
but can sure as shit fire you.

44:37.775 --> 44:39.880
Sm pop up with a new act,

44:40.078 --> 44:43.116
or you can hang up
your tired, tattered heals.

44:43.314 --> 44:44.987
Apologize to the lady.

44:45.216 --> 44:47.218
Who are you?
What are you doing in here?

44:47.418 --> 44:48.829
Fuck you.

44:49.053 --> 44:51.659
Excuse me, who the hell do
you think you're talking to?

44:51.889 --> 44:53.732
I'm talkin' to you, bitch.

44:53.925 --> 44:55.233
Now apologize to the lady,

44:55.426 --> 44:57.133
or you have me to
fuckin' deal with.

44:57.328 --> 44:59.208
All right, you have 10
seconds to leave this bar

44:59.297 --> 45:01.971
before I call the police
to have your dumb redneck,

45:02.166 --> 45:03.907
white-trash ass arrested.

45:04.102 --> 45:05.542
All right then.

45:05.736 --> 45:07.511
- Oh! on, my God!
- You can't kill him.

45:07.738 --> 45:09.308
That's the escaped
hitchhiker murderer.

45:09.507 --> 45:10.815
Oh!

45:11.008 --> 45:12.783
No, no, don't shoot him.
No, don't shoot.

45:12.977 --> 45:14.854
You can't shoot him in the head.

45:15.079 --> 45:17.320
You just shot
at the wrong person, ass wipe.

45:17.515 --> 45:18.858
I got it, I got it,
I got the gun.

45:19.083 --> 45:21.962
'Hey, no, no, no, no, no.

45:22.153 --> 45:25.293
Don't, don't, you'll splatter
blood on my costumes,

45:25.490 --> 45:26.833
and I've worked so hard on 'em.

45:27.024 --> 45:28.128
You gotta be shittin' me.

45:28.326 --> 45:30.431
No, I'm not shitting you.

45:30.628 --> 45:33.871
Blood and splattered
brains is so messy.

45:34.098 --> 45:36.339
Blood will not
come outta chiffon.

45:36.534 --> 45:38.775
- She's right about that.
- No!

45:38.970 --> 45:40.570
I mean it, Billy Joe,
don't you kill him.

45:42.507 --> 45:43.713
All right, then.

45:46.210 --> 45:48.212
This never happened.

45:48.446 --> 45:50.392
'Cause if one call
is made to the cops,

45:50.615 --> 45:53.061
I will come back here and
slice you from your asshole

45:53.284 --> 45:55.525
to your appetite, got it?

45:55.720 --> 45:57.791
I do, this never happened.

46:01.492 --> 46:03.972
You cumin', or not?

46:04.162 --> 46:06.972
Well, I guess so.
Under the circumstances,

46:07.165 --> 46:09.202
my options are rather limited.

46:12.470 --> 46:15.076
Oh, Good Lord.

46:15.306 --> 46:17.684
Oh, my God!

46:17.875 --> 46:20.981
I wish you
would look at old Vera!

46:21.179 --> 46:23.318
I guess a life committed
to ridin' a scooter is

46:23.514 --> 46:25.152
better than goin' on a diet.

46:25.349 --> 46:30.423
You know, some people just
don't care about their health.

46:32.256 --> 46:34.056
You know I've gut a
good mind to go over there

46:34.091 --> 46:36.435
and knock them off that
scooter and claw them to death

46:36.661 --> 46:37.935
with that fuckin' hammer.

46:38.162 --> 46:40.164
Roger, hun, you don't mean that.

46:40.364 --> 46:42.503
Murder is never a good option.

46:42.700 --> 46:46.580
I have just been beaten
down all my life by the Bible.

46:46.771 --> 46:50.583
And at some point, there
are no more cheeks to turn

46:50.775 --> 46:52.618
and no more fucks to give.

46:55.346 --> 46:57.587
Billy Joe, run! Run fast!

46:57.782 --> 47:00.888
That Singapore sling is evil.

47:01.085 --> 47:02.359
She cannot be trusted.

47:02.553 --> 47:03.930
Come on, come on, get in here.

47:04.121 --> 47:08.092
She's not Southern.
Help me, Ian!

47:08.292 --> 47:10.272
God, jeez, what is all that?

47:10.461 --> 47:13.635
It's my stuff,
for my show, now let's go.

47:13.864 --> 47:17.641
Goodbye,
Long-fucking-view, Texas.

47:18.769 --> 47:20.442
Haul ass, Billy Joe!

47:22.607 --> 47:26.419
Ladies, it's so good that
all of you are here together.

47:26.611 --> 47:28.613
We really want you to
come to our revival.

47:28.813 --> 47:33.922
Vera, I cannot be on your
anti-equality calling committee.

47:34.118 --> 47:36.655
Sissy, you don't believe
in equality, do you?

47:36.887 --> 47:38.628
I most certainly do.

47:38.823 --> 47:39.893
What's goin' on?

47:40.091 --> 47:41.331
Sissy believes in equality now.

47:41.425 --> 47:43.098
Well, then you don't
believe the Bible,

47:43.294 --> 47:45.638
and you're not right
with your maker.

47:45.830 --> 47:50.142
Jesus spoke to us, He said,
no service to the gays.

47:50.334 --> 47:53.076
No cakes, no flowers, no photos,

47:53.271 --> 47:55.649
and nobody to
perform the weddings.

47:55.840 --> 47:58.616
No gay marriage,
ever, ever, ever.

47:59.810 --> 48:01.346
Shh.

48:01.579 --> 48:05.083
Jesus is speakin' to me too,
right here and now.

48:05.283 --> 48:08.662
And the voice that I'm
hearin' is tellin' me...

48:08.853 --> 48:11.299
What? What's he sayin'?

48:11.489 --> 48:13.799
He's tellin' me...

48:13.991 --> 48:16.665
that he never said dip to you.

48:16.861 --> 48:20.468
And that you're a liar,
and a wolf in sheep's clothing.

48:20.665 --> 48:21.837
A very large sheep.

48:22.033 --> 48:24.673
Stop your
fat-shaming, LaVonda!

48:24.869 --> 48:27.679
This has nothin' to do
with what's on the outside,

48:27.872 --> 48:32.821
but the awfulness inside
these two hypocrites.

48:33.010 --> 48:34.785
What has gotten into you, Sissy?

48:34.979 --> 48:37.220
You're hurtin' my feelings.

48:37.448 --> 48:38.552
Love...

48:41.619 --> 48:46.568
and compassion, wasn't
that Christ's real message?

48:46.791 --> 48:50.705
And now I'm usin' my heart,
and the intelligence

48:50.895 --> 48:54.638
the Good Lord give me to
figure things out for myself.

48:54.832 --> 48:56.072
Well, I'm not.

48:57.702 --> 48:59.682
I... I didn't say that right.

48:59.870 --> 49:02.646
Oh, Vera, nothin'
you say is right.

49:02.840 --> 49:05.150
Come on, Latrelle, let's
head over to St. Angela's

49:05.343 --> 49:07.721
so we can tell your
asshole ex-husband off,

49:07.912 --> 49:11.382
'cause I'm on a roll and whoo,

49:11.582 --> 49:12.890
You're ready!

49:14.385 --> 49:15.728
Get outta my way!

49:18.589 --> 49:19.693
Sinners!

49:21.892 --> 49:24.395
Oh, Roger hun,

49:24.595 --> 49:26.734
could you do
a quick touch-up on my hair?

49:26.931 --> 49:29.741
I wanna luck my best for
the revival tomorrow night.

49:29.934 --> 49:33.905
Get your bacon-eatin'
Baptist asses outta my shop.

49:34.105 --> 49:36.278
And now that the Winter's
Hail-port is closed,

49:36.507 --> 49:39.283
and Lila Walker is no
longer the oldest living

49:39.510 --> 49:41.751
beautician in the
entire state of Texas,

49:41.946 --> 49:45.792
because she is dead, who the
fuck's gonna do your hair?

49:46.016 --> 49:49.589
Yeah, bitches, anti-equality
works both ways.

49:49.787 --> 49:52.199
Now you get the hell outta here
before I beat you...

49:53.624 --> 49:55.126
Get out, get out, get out, now!

49:55.359 --> 49:57.361
Get out, get out, now.

49:57.561 --> 50:00.201
That's right, bitches, get out.

50:04.034 --> 50:05.377
Whoa!

50:11.609 --> 50:12.781
So, where you wanna go?

50:12.977 --> 50:14.979
Dallas, to the Rose Room...

50:16.213 --> 50:18.784
where opportunity is rampant.

50:18.983 --> 50:20.462
We're gonna need some money.

50:20.651 --> 50:22.460
I'll be right
back, you stay put.

50:22.653 --> 50:24.064
Don't move.

50:24.255 --> 50:25.893
Will you get me a cold cola?

50:26.090 --> 50:27.125
What kind?

50:27.324 --> 50:28.598
Dr Pepper.

50:28.793 --> 50:31.239
Oh, and some cigs.
I'm down to my last 20,

50:31.429 --> 50:33.238
I should have grabbed
that stash of tips.

50:33.431 --> 50:35.342
Keep it, don't need it.

50:36.600 --> 50:38.102
Well, what a gentleman.

51:04.662 --> 51:06.539
Ugh, what the hell do you want?

51:07.832 --> 51:09.038
Hello, Greta.

51:10.334 --> 51:11.711
I need to speak to Wilson.

51:11.936 --> 51:13.506
Have you ever heard of
the telephone or email?

51:13.704 --> 51:15.584
Have you ever heard of
age-appropriate dressing?

51:15.773 --> 51:18.811
Whatever, hitch.

51:19.009 --> 51:21.489
Wilson, your ex-wife
Latree is here.

51:21.679 --> 51:23.625
Latrelle.

51:23.814 --> 51:26.522
You know it's Latrelle.

51:26.717 --> 51:28.390
I'm about to bust my bladder.

51:28.619 --> 51:30.121
Put all the fuckin'
money in the fuckin' bag.

51:30.321 --> 51:32.130
That's right, don't
you fuckin' move.

51:32.323 --> 51:34.303
All the money in that fuckin'
bag, that's it right there.

51:34.492 --> 51:37.166
Give me the fuckin'
money or I'll shoot her

51:37.361 --> 51:38.704
in the fucking face.

51:38.896 --> 51:41.536
I might have bit
off more than I can chew.

51:41.732 --> 51:42.870
Get in the truck!
Get in the truck!

51:43.067 --> 51:44.705
Get in the goddamn truck!

51:44.902 --> 51:48.213
Well, if I'd known you was
gonna commit armed robbery,

51:48.405 --> 51:51.181
I would not have
worn my kitten heels.

51:51.375 --> 51:52.410
Come on.

51:57.314 --> 51:58.418
What the hell do you want?

52:00.251 --> 52:02.561
Do you mind?

52:02.753 --> 52:05.199
Whatever you wanna
say in front of me,

52:05.389 --> 52:07.528
you can say in front of my wife.

52:07.725 --> 52:08.760
Wife?

52:08.993 --> 52:10.267
Wife!

52:10.494 --> 52:12.565
Right after my divorce
was final last month,

52:12.763 --> 52:16.210
and we were both free
of our horrible pasts,

52:16.400 --> 52:18.539
we had a simple private
ceremony in San Antonio

52:18.736 --> 52:20.409
with a mariachi band.

52:20.604 --> 52:24.108
Mm, it was perfect for
our simple yet pure love.

52:25.276 --> 52:26.914
Well, I, I didn't know.

52:27.111 --> 52:30.581
Well, what'd you expect,
Latrelle? A wedding invitation?

52:32.383 --> 52:33.953
You're gonna be
a grandpa, Wilson.

52:34.184 --> 52:35.959
What?

52:36.186 --> 52:38.188
Huh, Ty and Kyle's surrogate

52:38.389 --> 52:40.027
is pregnant with twins.

52:40.224 --> 52:42.465
I can explain how that
works if y'all need me to.

52:42.693 --> 52:44.604
Works against God's
nature is what it does.

52:44.795 --> 52:46.900
Just as their relationship
and their lifestyle

52:47.097 --> 52:48.701
works against God's will.

52:48.899 --> 52:51.402
That's right. We believe
that God created Adam and Eve,

52:51.602 --> 52:52.945
and not Adam and Steve,

52:53.137 --> 52:55.048
and that marriage is
between a man and a woman.

52:55.239 --> 52:58.618
Shouldn't that be between
a man, his first wife,

52:58.809 --> 53:00.914
and then a couple of
trashy waitresses?

53:01.111 --> 53:02.385
Did she just call me trashy?

53:02.580 --> 53:04.116
Well, if the hooker heel fits.

53:04.315 --> 53:06.090
And I am a singer,
not a waitress.

53:06.283 --> 53:08.092
At the Bowl-a-Rama.

53:08.285 --> 53:10.605
Wilson, are you going to allow
her to talk to me like this?

53:10.788 --> 53:12.597
Allow? Oh, honey,

53:12.790 --> 53:15.669
he never had that
kinda control aver me.

53:15.893 --> 53:19.568
Greta, hurl, do y'all
believe all the Bible?

53:21.565 --> 53:23.135
This feels like
a trick question.

53:23.334 --> 53:25.245
We absolutely do.

53:25.436 --> 53:28.007
We hate the sin,
but we love the sinner.

53:28.238 --> 53:30.582
Latrelle, we're
gonna need some rocks.

53:30.774 --> 53:32.151
Rocks?

53:32.343 --> 53:34.584
Yes, hun, I hate to inform
you, but the Bible is

53:34.778 --> 53:37.622
very clear on
stonin' adulterers.

53:38.749 --> 53:40.592
Covered in several passages.

53:40.784 --> 53:42.923
So I guess me and
Latrelle are gonna have to

53:43.120 --> 53:44.656
stone you and Wilson.

53:44.855 --> 53:47.768
Ew, would right here in
the driveway be acceptable?

53:47.958 --> 53:51.098
Sissy, would these
bricks that I lined

53:51.295 --> 53:53.468
this flower bed with,
will they do?

53:53.664 --> 53:56.201
Bullshit! Ga on and
get off my property.

53:56.433 --> 53:58.640
You are gonna be
a grandpa, Wilson.

53:58.836 --> 54:01.180
Our gay son is gonna he a daddy.

54:01.372 --> 54:03.978
And he will parent with
the gay man who he loves

54:04.174 --> 54:07.383
and is legally married to,
so get used to it.

54:07.611 --> 54:09.488
Stop being such
a terrible father.

54:09.680 --> 54:10.818
Get off the property.

54:10.981 --> 54:12.119
Yeah, or I'm gonna call
the police.

54:12.316 --> 54:15.024
The property you stole from me?

54:15.219 --> 54:17.290
Gladly. Come on, Sissy.

54:17.488 --> 54:19.126
Nice to meet you, Greta.

54:19.323 --> 54:22.497
I am real happy we
didn't have to stone you.

54:23.727 --> 54:25.035
Wilson.

54:25.229 --> 54:26.640
Good job, Latrelle.

54:26.830 --> 54:27.900
I felt it went well.

54:28.132 --> 54:29.543
Um, yeah.

54:29.733 --> 54:31.542
Give it to me, daddy.

54:35.639 --> 54:37.016
What?

54:37.207 --> 54:40.654
I'm sorry, I think
we have to come up with

54:40.844 --> 54:42.152
a better way to talk dirty.

54:42.346 --> 54:45.589
I don't think we can use
daddy like that anymore.

54:45.816 --> 54:48.490
Right.

54:48.686 --> 54:49.858
Wow.

54:51.588 --> 54:54.728
Urn, man, we're gonna
be daddies, Ty.

54:58.395 --> 54:59.835
We are gonna be
the best damn daddies

54:59.930 --> 55:01.773
God ever put on this Earth.

55:05.903 --> 55:07.246
Unlike mine.

55:08.872 --> 55:11.853
Hey, bringin' us down.

55:12.042 --> 55:13.544
Literally.

55:16.046 --> 55:17.889
Talk dirty, baby.

55:19.049 --> 55:21.029
Give me that BBC my, um...

55:23.253 --> 55:25.233
hot, black man?

55:28.559 --> 55:30.903
Hurry up, I don't want
Aunt Little Neecy to see me.

55:31.095 --> 55:32.369
She's become attached.

55:32.563 --> 55:34.736
Did you miss me?

55:34.965 --> 55:37.104
Well, kinda.

55:37.301 --> 55:38.871
I'm not wearin' any underwear.

55:40.304 --> 55:42.113
Your mama.

55:42.306 --> 55:44.582
Oh, right, tests pending
are no longer pending.

55:44.775 --> 55:46.482
Well, if it's had
news you come back here

55:46.710 --> 55:48.383
and I will comfort you.

55:48.579 --> 55:50.581
But if it's good news,
you come back here

55:50.781 --> 55:52.158
and we'll celebrate.

55:52.382 --> 55:54.453
- Win-win.
- Yeah.

55:54.651 --> 55:56.790
How the fuck is
this happenin' to you?

55:58.756 --> 56:00.235
Trash!

56:03.127 --> 56:05.607
We just need to hang
out here a couple hours,

56:05.796 --> 56:07.332
until it gets dark.

56:07.564 --> 56:11.011
Get a little sleep,
let things cool down,

56:11.235 --> 56:12.955
then we'll take a back
road on up to Dallas.

56:14.471 --> 56:17.816
Life of crime is so exciting.

56:19.409 --> 56:21.582
I love bein' on
the lamb with you.

56:25.449 --> 56:27.861
Well, there, one bed.

56:28.085 --> 56:31.623
I am so glad it was
ptomaine and not cancer!

56:34.158 --> 56:36.468
Oh, yes, he does!
Oh, give glory! Give glory!

56:36.660 --> 56:37.866
Hallelujah!

56:38.095 --> 56:39.267
Oh, Jesus!

56:41.198 --> 56:44.111
Oh, whoa, we win, win, win,

56:44.301 --> 56:46.679
hold one, one more, one...
whee!

56:48.839 --> 56:51.979
- Jesus, oh, win, win!
- Huh?

56:52.176 --> 56:53.655
Noleta?

56:53.844 --> 56:55.323
Win, win, win, win.

56:57.181 --> 57:01.323
Kinda looks like a
bald, naked Jesus if

57:01.518 --> 57:04.965
Jesus had tattoos,
which he did not.

57:05.155 --> 57:07.795
You don't have a snowball's
chance in hell with this one,

57:07.991 --> 57:09.868
- you little monkey freak.
- Go away.

57:10.060 --> 57:13.872
No, even prison
trash is above you.

57:14.064 --> 57:18.911
You do my masturbation
exercises, look at these.

57:19.136 --> 57:20.638
No, I'll masturbate,
but I won't think of you

57:20.838 --> 57:22.146
and those cow-dung titties.

57:22.339 --> 57:23.647
I'm gonna think about
Billy Joe Dobson,

57:23.841 --> 57:25.047
the hitchhiker murderer.

57:25.242 --> 57:26.482
You'll think of me
if I say you will.

57:26.677 --> 57:28.554
No, go away! No!

57:28.745 --> 57:30.019
No!

57:31.849 --> 57:33.487
Who the hell are you talkin' to?

57:34.751 --> 57:36.890
You.

57:37.087 --> 57:41.263
Huh, just a silly
way of wakin' you up.

57:43.160 --> 57:44.901
Beats the hell out
of "rise and shine,"

57:45.095 --> 57:46.597
give God the glory, glory.

57:46.830 --> 57:48.741
Dude, you are fuckin' crazy.

57:51.101 --> 57:52.705
And I like crazy.

57:56.206 --> 57:59.085
Wonder which one
is the mixed twin.

58:19.563 --> 58:20.598
<i>Hi, Mama.</i>

58:20.797 --> 58:23.038
Ty, I need you to come home.

58:25.602 --> 58:27.081
Winters needs you.

58:28.605 --> 58:30.278
Why don't you scare me?

58:31.775 --> 58:33.482
I think my killin'
days are over.

58:35.312 --> 58:37.258
Maybe you can sense that.

58:37.447 --> 58:39.927
Well, it works in my favor.

58:40.117 --> 58:41.824
Come over here by me.

58:54.464 --> 58:57.274
You mind?

58:57.467 --> 58:59.504
No, uh-uh, I don't mind.

58:59.736 --> 59:03.616
The killin'
was all connected to sex.

59:05.575 --> 59:09.284
I'm attracted tn women and
men, just about everything.

59:09.479 --> 59:12.119
Except farm animals.

59:12.316 --> 59:15.160
But, my attraction is
only for dead people.

59:17.487 --> 59:21.333
Besides, I can't get this
monster dick of mine up no more.

59:21.525 --> 59:23.334
Them days are over.

59:23.527 --> 59:25.097
- Monster?
- Mm.

59:25.295 --> 59:26.865
Where does it end?

59:28.699 --> 59:30.975
You might be a killer,
but you ain't a liar.

59:34.538 --> 59:35.812
I don't wanna be that,

59:36.006 --> 59:38.145
a killer.

59:40.877 --> 59:42.948
I take full responsibility,

59:43.146 --> 59:47.561
but I had a childhood that was
like a goddamn horror movie.

59:51.221 --> 59:52.325
Can't go there.

59:54.524 --> 59:58.495
It was just somethin',
the killin', I couldn't control.

01:00:01.965 --> 01:00:03.069
I tried...

01:00:05.168 --> 01:00:06.306
so hard.

01:00:08.872 --> 01:00:11.352
My kind ain't too
popular in the big house.

01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:14.989
Some inmates cut my nuts off.

01:00:15.178 --> 01:00:16.987
Cut your nuts off?

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:18.386
Yep.

01:00:18.582 --> 01:00:20.255
Them guards just stood
back and laughed,

01:00:20.484 --> 01:00:22.760
I almost bled to death.

01:00:22.986 --> 01:00:25.990
If it hadn't been for
this big old black queer

01:00:26.189 --> 01:00:28.169
named Ribeye, I would've.

01:00:31.561 --> 01:00:34.235
Maybe that's why I like you.

01:00:34.431 --> 01:00:36.502
You kinda remind
me of old Ribeye.

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:38.407
Oh, you've lost me.

01:00:38.602 --> 01:00:39.945
Well,

01:00:40.170 --> 01:00:42.116
he was real, real sissy.

01:00:42.339 --> 01:00:43.875
Almost a woman.

01:00:44.074 --> 01:00:47.112
Oh, yeah, well,
that makes complete sense.

01:00:48.578 --> 01:00:50.353
But Ribeye saved my life.

01:00:50.547 --> 01:00:53.756
Sewed my nut sack shut.
Hurt like a motherfucker.

01:00:55.452 --> 01:00:58.922
He nursed me back to
health real tender-like.

01:00:59.122 --> 01:01:02.763
Felt more love than
I'd ever felt in my life.

01:01:06.363 --> 01:01:08.240
Didn't want sex.

01:01:08.432 --> 01:01:09.570
Nothing.

01:01:11.868 --> 01:01:13.245
It was just love.

01:01:16.239 --> 01:01:18.412
But then Ribeye met his maker.

01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:21.448
Got into some bad drug shit

01:01:21.645 --> 01:01:23.784
and was stabbed
right in front of me.

01:01:27.384 --> 01:01:30.297
Everybody I ever
love just leaves.

01:01:35.759 --> 01:01:37.238
I'm scared to die.

01:01:40.597 --> 01:01:42.477
'Cause I know with all
I done here on this Earth

01:01:42.566 --> 01:01:44.944
I don't have no chance
of goin' to heaven.

01:01:48.138 --> 01:01:50.948
I will be burnin' in that
lake of fire for eternity.

01:01:52.409 --> 01:01:53.683
I'm bound for hell.

01:01:58.648 --> 01:02:00.457
So, that's why I escaped.

01:02:03.019 --> 01:02:04.794
'Cause they was suppose to
execute me in a few days

01:02:04.988 --> 01:02:06.797
and I was scared shitless.

01:02:09.659 --> 01:02:11.104
So, I guess...

01:02:13.163 --> 01:02:14.267
in a way,

01:02:15.765 --> 01:02:17.045
losin' my nuts
was the best thing

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:20.138
that could have happened
to me, and you.

01:02:20.337 --> 01:02:24.114
'Cause if I still had my nuts,
I'd have killed you,

01:02:24.307 --> 01:02:25.809
then we'd have sex,
which you couldn't enjoy

01:02:26.009 --> 01:02:27.511
'cause you would be dead,
but then...

01:02:29.146 --> 01:02:31.387
I'd certainly be
attracted to you.

01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:34.622
Well, thank you.

01:02:36.887 --> 01:02:40.232
Sure makes me feel
better about myself.

01:02:40.457 --> 01:02:43.802
Dear sweet Jesus, this is
the strangest conversation

01:02:43.994 --> 01:02:47.669
I have ever had in my
entire life.

01:02:51.067 --> 01:02:52.171
What?

01:03:03.713 --> 01:03:04.851
For Ribeye.

I learned something very
valuable from meeting you.

01:04:26.263 --> 01:04:27.640
What's that?

01:04:27.831 --> 01:04:30.505
Never judge a serial killer.

01:04:39.943 --> 01:04:41.149
Bye-bye.

01:04:56.493 --> 01:04:57.938

I'm in a freakin' dress
and he is gayer than I am.

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:05.540
And he's wearin' more makeup.

01:08:05.682 --> 01:08:07.457
Stoli cran and one mint, please.

01:08:07.650 --> 01:08:09.220
How you doin'?

01:08:09.452 --> 01:08:10.624
Oh, no, other side.

01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:15.330
He slapped his ass,
I don't care about his ass.

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:17.964
Or his face.

01:08:19.729 --> 01:08:22.538
Now tonight, we are
being sponsored by Stoli,

01:08:22.732 --> 01:08:25.406
so lift your glasses with
me in the name of the Lord

01:08:25.635 --> 01:08:27.911
and all that is holy,
cheers to queers.

01:08:28.136 --> 01:08:31.675
Oh, Lord, look how young I was.

01:08:31.875 --> 01:08:33.752
Yeah, that was about
the time that I...

01:08:33.977 --> 01:08:37.082
kissed the most beautiful
gal I'd ever seen.

01:08:37.313 --> 01:08:39.554
Down by the old cow pond.

01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:41.558
I was barely 16.

01:08:41.751 --> 01:08:43.354
Yeah.

01:08:43.553 --> 01:08:48.002
Oh, and that's not all
we did down by the cow pond

01:08:48.191 --> 01:08:50.261
if I remember correctly.

01:08:50.493 --> 01:08:53.497
Ah, young love.
Nothin' like it.

01:08:55.098 --> 01:08:57.270
Well, maybe there is, Vonnie.

01:08:59.234 --> 01:09:01.078
'Cause you're still
the most beautiful gal

01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:03.444
I've ever laid eyes on.

01:09:21.057 --> 01:09:23.196
I never stopped
loving you, Vonnie.

01:09:24.861 --> 01:09:27.865
I never stopped
loving you, Wardell.

01:09:40.042 --> 01:09:41.647
Ladies and gentlemen,
y'all make some noise for

01:09:41.877 --> 01:09:43.118
the gorgeous Krystal Feather.

01:09:44.647 --> 01:09:46.456
Great job, girl. Great job.

01:09:46.649 --> 01:09:49.993
You see, this is the goal,
queens. This is the goal.

01:09:50.219 --> 01:09:52.290
All right you all, for
this next entertainer,

01:09:52.488 --> 01:09:55.128
I want y'all to keep y'all's
expectations real low.

01:09:55.325 --> 01:09:59.171
'Cause this next old country
queen, is short as fuck.

01:09:59.395 --> 01:10:02.638
Ladies and gentlemen,
Miss Tammy Whynot.

01:10:05.802 --> 01:10:08.840
It's Wynette, run and
tell her, Tammy Wynette.

01:10:09.072 --> 01:10:10.517
Drink up, girl.

I don't think she's gonna win.

01:11:26.082 --> 01:11:27.857
Thank you

01:11:28.051 --> 01:11:29.724
George Jones drank
to calm his nerves.

01:11:29.919 --> 01:11:31.899
It did not work for me.

01:11:38.327 --> 01:11:40.830
Excuse me, but...

01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:44.170
I am so sorry you all had
to witness this catastrophe.

01:11:44.367 --> 01:11:46.244
I got up stage and
I just bunched up.

01:11:46.436 --> 01:11:50.179
My throat, I just...
I couldn't. I froze.

01:11:50.373 --> 01:11:52.580
I think you're my
Uncle Brother Boy.

01:11:52.775 --> 01:11:54.846
You're Latrelle's boy.

01:11:55.044 --> 01:11:56.079
I am.

01:11:56.279 --> 01:11:57.349
Ty.

01:11:57.547 --> 01:11:59.390
This is my husband, Kyle.

01:11:59.582 --> 01:12:00.686
Your husband?

01:12:03.119 --> 01:12:06.225
I just wanna kiss you
on the cheek, both.

01:12:10.793 --> 01:12:12.204
Love those nails.

01:12:12.395 --> 01:12:14.932
Oh, they'd look
good with your color.

01:12:15.131 --> 01:12:16.235
I mean...

01:12:19.435 --> 01:12:20.539
Do you live here?

01:12:20.737 --> 01:12:22.216
I hitchhiked up
here from Longview.

01:12:22.405 --> 01:12:24.282
It's just a really long story.

01:12:24.474 --> 01:12:29.287
I'm, um... everything
I own is in a sack.

01:12:29.479 --> 01:12:33.552
All my possessions, my worldly
possessions, are in a sack.

01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:35.991
We're headed hack to
Winters Uncle Brother Boy.

01:12:36.219 --> 01:12:37.664
Do you want to
come home with us?

01:12:37.887 --> 01:12:39.798
Hell, no. I ain't been
home since I saw you

01:12:39.989 --> 01:12:41.468
last time at Mama's funeral.

01:12:41.657 --> 01:12:45.730
That was almost a bigger
disaster than tonight.

01:12:45.928 --> 01:12:48.067
I think you should reconsider.

01:12:48.264 --> 01:12:51.245
It's time we all
be a family again.

You hussy.

01:13:09.986 --> 01:13:12.330
Guilty.

01:13:12.522 --> 01:13:13.933
Where have you been all night?

01:13:14.123 --> 01:13:17.002
Oh, Sissy, me and
Wardell got back together.

01:13:17.193 --> 01:13:19.332
Oh!

01:13:19.529 --> 01:13:21.008
<i>I'm so happy for you</i>

Oh!

01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:25.335
Well, who in the world?

01:13:25.535 --> 01:13:26.809
Are you expectin' anybody?

01:13:28.604 --> 01:13:32.552
- Ty, oh, heavens to Betsy!
- Aunt Sissy!

01:13:32.775 --> 01:13:36.382
Oh, you must be Kyle.
Welcome to Winters.

01:13:36.612 --> 01:13:37.716
It's a pleasure to be here.

01:13:37.947 --> 01:13:40.052
And look who we
found just wanderin'

01:13:40.283 --> 01:13:42.126
the streets of Dallas.

01:13:43.686 --> 01:13:46.030
Oh!
Hi, Brother Boy, oh.

01:13:48.224 --> 01:13:50.500
Come on, I finally made it.

01:13:50.693 --> 01:13:52.366
Everybody come on in, come on.

01:13:54.130 --> 01:13:55.370
Come on in, Ty.

01:13:56.999 --> 01:13:58.535
I'm gonna go on in

01:13:58.734 --> 01:14:00.042
and finish gettin'
some breakfast

01:14:00.236 --> 01:14:01.738
- Ooh, shh, shh!
- We are interrupting regular

01:14:01.971 --> 01:14:03.678
<i>programming for this special

01:14:03.873 --> 01:14:04.953

The fallen angel has

01:14:26.429 --> 01:14:27.601
Yes, she has.

01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:29.207
That poor old woman.

01:14:29.398 --> 01:14:32.072
Wonder why she's
hitchhiking at her age.

01:14:32.268 --> 01:14:33.338
Sissy!

01:14:33.536 --> 01:14:35.447
Sissy!

01:14:37.773 --> 01:14:39.514
Ty, you made it.

01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:41.416
We did. We made it, Mama.

01:14:41.611 --> 01:14:43.284
Ah, and Kyle.

01:14:43.512 --> 01:14:46.356
Oh, well, gut
everything planned.

01:14:46.549 --> 01:14:48.222
It's all mapped out.

01:14:48.417 --> 01:14:50.397
All right, well, let's discuss
everything over breakfast,

01:14:50.586 --> 01:14:54.591
I got plenty. It's almost ready
and nobody likes cold biscuits.

01:14:55.892 --> 01:14:57.303
Look who we brought.

01:15:00.363 --> 01:15:01.706
Brother Boy.

01:15:04.901 --> 01:15:06.437
You look very pretty.

01:15:09.906 --> 01:15:11.749
I missed you.

01:15:11.941 --> 01:15:13.215
Do I know you?

01:15:15.311 --> 01:15:18.758
Well, I guess I deserved
that but, I'm tryin'.

01:15:18.948 --> 01:15:21.155
Oh, she's still a bitch,

01:15:21.384 --> 01:15:23.421
but it's just not
non-stop anymore.

01:15:23.619 --> 01:15:25.997
Do you mind?

01:15:26.222 --> 01:15:27.462
Come on, boys.

01:15:32.161 --> 01:15:34.402
Brother Boy, I's awful to you

01:15:34.597 --> 01:15:36.304
for years, and I'm just so...

01:15:36.499 --> 01:15:38.137
No, honey, you don't
have to do this.

01:15:38.334 --> 01:15:40.336
No, no, I do, I need to.

01:15:40.569 --> 01:15:42.776
I'm sorry,

01:15:42.972 --> 01:15:45.418
it's just that so much
has changed.

01:15:47.343 --> 01:15:48.447
Is changin'.

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:52.850
Guess it just took me awhile.

01:15:53.082 --> 01:15:54.493
Awhile?

01:15:54.684 --> 01:15:58.291
Too long, okay? I wanna
make up for lost time.

01:15:58.487 --> 01:15:59.932
Can we?

01:16:01.991 --> 01:16:06.462
Can we go back to the way
it was when we were little?

01:16:06.662 --> 01:16:09.370
We used to play
dress-up together.

01:16:09.598 --> 01:16:12.545
Well, what size dress are you?

01:16:16.172 --> 01:16:18.982
Oh, I love you.

01:16:19.175 --> 01:16:21.155
I love you.

01:16:21.344 --> 01:16:24.450
I love you too, Latrelle.
Good Lord.

01:16:24.647 --> 01:16:25.990
That's good.

01:16:26.215 --> 01:16:28.217
Thank you, Ty. Y'all
just sit down anywhere.

01:16:28.451 --> 01:16:29.657
Now you did some remodelin'.

01:16:29.852 --> 01:16:32.162
I did, now I can watch my shows

01:16:32.355 --> 01:16:34.164
while I'm eatin' and cookin'.

01:16:34.357 --> 01:16:35.802
Oh, he is black.

01:16:37.226 --> 01:16:38.728
I prefer hot chocolate mocha.

01:16:38.961 --> 01:16:40.804
Then tea, of course.

01:16:40.997 --> 01:16:44.171
Has hot chocolate mocha
replaced African-American?

01:16:44.367 --> 01:16:46.040
No, I'm just bein' silly.

01:16:46.235 --> 01:16:48.579
And I'm a guessing this
pretty lady must be Noleta.

01:16:48.804 --> 01:16:50.909
Why, hey, thank
you, yes, Noleta.

01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:55.213
I'm white, can't even tan,
and I'm in love too, I think.

01:16:55.411 --> 01:16:57.584
But it's not the gay
love. Can't go there.

01:16:57.813 --> 01:16:59.918
Sometimes I think it'd be
easier, less complicated,

01:17:00.149 --> 01:17:02.823
but I am attracted to black men.

01:17:03.019 --> 01:17:06.159
Ow, uh, African-American
men. That's right too.

01:17:06.355 --> 01:17:08.494
"Black" works. I've
never been African.

01:17:08.691 --> 01:17:11.035
Well, I sure am
excited about your

01:17:11.227 --> 01:17:14.265
one white and one mixed twin.

01:17:14.497 --> 01:17:16.204
Uh, we prefer biracial.

01:17:16.399 --> 01:17:19.608
Biracial. Oh, Lord,
I cannot keep up.

01:17:22.071 --> 01:17:25.052
Oh, girl, you been busy.

01:17:25.241 --> 01:17:26.914
I try, do my best.

01:17:27.109 --> 01:17:28.679
And that's what matters.

01:17:28.878 --> 01:17:31.552
I believe the intention is
more important than the words.

01:17:31.747 --> 01:17:34.387
All good to know,
but we gotta get organized

01:17:34.583 --> 01:17:37.359
for the anti-equality
revival tonight.

01:17:37.553 --> 01:17:39.191
We gotta get busy,

01:17:39.388 --> 01:17:42.062
because shit is about
to hit the fan.

01:17:45.394 --> 01:17:47.465
Would you lead us
in an open word of prayer?

01:17:47.696 --> 01:17:50.973
Well, of course, ladies.

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:55.580
Let the church house he packed
to the rafters, uh, Lord.

01:17:55.771 --> 01:17:56.943
Yes, Lord.

01:17:57.139 --> 01:18:00.279
Let sinners come
in that front door.

01:18:00.476 --> 01:18:01.921
What's goin' on here?

01:18:02.111 --> 01:18:05.456
Juanita, hun, we're right
in the middle of our final

01:18:05.648 --> 01:18:08.561
anti-equality committee meeting.

01:18:08.751 --> 01:18:10.424
That doesn't sound right.

01:18:10.619 --> 01:18:12.064
Well, it is.

01:18:12.254 --> 01:18:15.497
Now we would just love
for you to join us tonight,

01:18:15.724 --> 01:18:17.328
if you would.

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:20.564
I have a conflict.
There's somethin' goin' on

01:18:20.763 --> 01:18:25.269
real important over at that
bar that I sometimes frequent

01:18:25.468 --> 01:18:28.142
uh, called, uh, I forget.

01:18:29.405 --> 01:18:30.577
Bubba's?

01:18:30.773 --> 01:18:32.446
That would be the one.

01:18:32.641 --> 01:18:35.281
Might as well be called
the den of inequity.

01:18:35.478 --> 01:18:38.254
I think that one's
over in New Orleans.

01:18:38.447 --> 01:18:44.363
Hey, big'un, a pack of my
cigarettes and these Cheetos.

01:18:44.587 --> 01:18:49.093
The name is Vera.
Vera Lisso, not big'un.

01:18:49.291 --> 01:18:51.328
We've been through this
a few hundred times.

01:18:51.527 --> 01:18:53.165
Big'un suits you better.

01:18:54.997 --> 01:18:59.104
The bass people make
a cheese out of raw milk

01:18:59.301 --> 01:19:02.839
that is aged in a cave
for four or five months.

01:19:03.038 --> 01:19:05.040
How do you know that, Juanita?

01:19:05.274 --> 01:19:06.309
I forget.

01:19:10.479 --> 01:19:12.516
Keep the change, hig'un.

01:19:12.715 --> 01:19:14.023
It's two pennies.

01:19:14.216 --> 01:19:16.355
All yours.

01:19:16.552 --> 01:19:18.896
And it's ripened with mold,

01:19:19.121 --> 01:19:22.000
and they scrape the mold
off before you eat it.

01:19:22.191 --> 01:19:26.503
And that's where
the bass people lost me.

01:19:26.695 --> 01:19:30.700
The gates are down,
and the lights are flashing,

01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:33.744
but the train is not coming.

Yes, and please forgive
our appearance today,

01:20:40.603 --> 01:20:45.052

homosexual, has decided

01:20:45.241 --> 01:20:50.247
not to fix anybody's hair who

Amen.

01:20:59.722 --> 01:21:04.330
Please welcome to Southside
Baptist our new pastor,

01:21:05.661 --> 01:21:07.436
Jimmy Ray Brewton.

01:21:09.632 --> 01:21:11.077
Roger?

01:21:11.267 --> 01:21:12.302
Ty?

01:21:15.404 --> 01:21:18.112
Roger, this is my husband, Kyle.

01:21:18.307 --> 01:21:19.684
Nice to meet you, Roger.

01:21:19.908 --> 01:21:22.684
And you. Lord, these
people are not gonna know

01:21:22.911 --> 01:21:25.517
whether to be racist
or homophobic.

01:21:25.748 --> 01:21:27.591
Did I miss anything?

01:21:27.783 --> 01:21:30.525
Nothin' you haven't heard a
hundred million times before.

01:21:30.753 --> 01:21:33.359
But that preacher
is hot as fuck.

01:21:33.589 --> 01:21:39.267
Thou shalt not lie with
mankind as with womankind.

01:21:39.461 --> 01:21:41.168
It is an abomination.

01:21:41.363 --> 01:21:42.933
- Amen.
- Amen, brother.

01:21:43.132 --> 01:21:45.252
You know, Satan was the
first to ask for equal rights.

01:21:45.301 --> 01:21:46.644
Yeah, that's right.

01:21:46.835 --> 01:21:50.009
Flip over to Isaiah 14:14,
where Lucifer proclaims,

01:21:50.205 --> 01:21:52.481
"I will he like the most high."

01:21:54.476 --> 01:21:56.456
Wanted to be equal with God.

01:21:56.645 --> 01:21:59.387
But Satan never gut his
equal rights, did he?

01:21:59.615 --> 01:22:03.324
No, no, he fell down
to the bowels of hell.

01:22:03.519 --> 01:22:05.123
Just like the gays will.

01:22:05.321 --> 01:22:07.631
I used to love this church.

01:22:07.823 --> 01:22:09.666
You know they're not
all like this anymore.

01:22:09.858 --> 01:22:10.962
You can't swing
a cat in this town

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:13.071
without hittin' a bigot.

01:22:13.295 --> 01:22:17.300
I remember, but you know,
hearts and minds are changin'.

01:22:17.499 --> 01:22:21.174
But, hey, these bigots actually
inspired me to do what I do.

01:22:21.370 --> 01:22:25.079
I work for Faith in America,
and we try to help people

01:22:25.307 --> 01:22:29.153
work through the damage,
and to prove to them that

01:22:29.345 --> 01:22:31.484
God includes us too.

01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:35.651
They question the creation,
you question the creator.

01:22:35.851 --> 01:22:38.263
Lots of affirmin' churches
poppin' up everywhere.

01:22:38.487 --> 01:22:40.207
My mama's the pastor
of one over in Phoenix.

01:22:40.255 --> 01:22:41.495
Lucky you.

01:22:45.327 --> 01:22:47.773
You put a face on gay, Roger.

01:22:47.996 --> 01:22:49.907
When I was a little boy,
I used to sit and

01:22:50.099 --> 01:22:53.239
watch Roger do Mama, and Aunt
LaVonda, and Aunt Sissy's hair,

01:22:53.435 --> 01:22:56.905
and I used to pretend that
I was Roger from Avila.

01:22:57.106 --> 01:23:00.087
I ratted my dull Suzy Q's
hair until she was bald.

01:23:02.177 --> 01:23:07.286
You inspired me to
accept all of me, so...

01:23:09.551 --> 01:23:10.621
thank you.

01:23:13.922 --> 01:23:15.959
You don't know what
that means to me.

01:23:20.262 --> 01:23:22.401
Oh, we better get in there.
Mama's about to explode.

01:23:22.598 --> 01:23:24.236
Are you comin'?

01:23:24.433 --> 01:23:27.880
Oh, hell no. I can hear the
hate just fine from out here.

01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:31.540
Always the
best option for our lives.

01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:35.244
Thank y'all.

01:23:35.444 --> 01:23:37.788
Oh, that was my
mama's favorite hymn.

01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:39.653
Oh, that was just
beautiful, Wardell.

01:23:39.882 --> 01:23:42.042
You know, Vonnie, last night
was really special for me.

01:23:42.151 --> 01:23:43.494
Me too.

01:23:43.719 --> 01:23:45.596
That's it.

01:23:45.788 --> 01:23:47.995
D.W., don't
you even think about it.

01:23:48.223 --> 01:23:49.930
- Hey, you son of a bitch!
- What the hell?

01:23:50.125 --> 01:23:52.127
Oh, hi, S.W., I didn't
see you standing there.

01:23:52.327 --> 01:23:54.087
Get your goddamn white
trash hands off a her.

01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:55.936
You're the white trash
and you have no claim to me.

01:23:56.131 --> 01:23:59.408
Our D-I-V-0-R-C-E became
final 17 years ago.

01:23:59.601 --> 01:24:01.581
Oh, for crying out loud!

01:24:01.770 --> 01:24:04.808
Wardell, do somethin'. They're
ruinin' my mama's tribute.

01:24:05.073 --> 01:24:06.143
They're fightin'
over me, LaVonda.

01:24:06.341 --> 01:24:07.979
Oh, they're fightin' over me.

01:24:08.177 --> 01:24:09.747
Oh, you're goin' down, asshole.

01:24:09.945 --> 01:24:11.322
It's on you son of a hitch.

01:24:11.513 --> 01:24:13.186
Go on, knock his
teeth out, G.W.

01:24:13.415 --> 01:24:14.587
Now.

01:24:17.753 --> 01:24:19.960
- Not a damn thing.
- Come on, kick his ass!

01:24:26.161 --> 01:24:27.697
I lost my leg!

01:24:27.930 --> 01:24:30.536
I got you.
Come here, come here.

01:24:30.766 --> 01:24:33.474
Gotta get that pyromaniac
tramp with my leg.

01:24:33.669 --> 01:24:36.206
She ain't no tramp. Give me
back my crutches right now.

01:24:36.438 --> 01:24:37.473
You give me back...

01:24:39.174 --> 01:24:41.780
Y'all ought to he
ashamed of yourselves.

01:24:41.977 --> 01:24:46.050
We are tryin' to honor the life
of a good woman here today,

01:24:46.281 --> 01:24:47.692
and y'all are ruinin' it!

01:24:47.883 --> 01:24:50.295
Noleta you came in here
just seekin' trouble.

01:24:50.486 --> 01:24:52.557
Now you get outta my bar,
get yourself a room

01:24:52.788 --> 01:24:54.859
at the Galaxy Motel.

01:24:55.057 --> 01:24:57.901
And G.W., stop this
damn nonsense.

01:24:58.126 --> 01:25:00.868
You forfeited every right you
had in your marriage to Noleta.

01:25:01.063 --> 01:25:03.168
Peggy was the one
you really loved, buddy.

01:25:03.365 --> 01:25:05.345
You loved Peggy.

01:25:05.534 --> 01:25:07.707
I know.

01:25:07.903 --> 01:25:09.143
Now let's show her
that tonight, huh?

01:25:09.338 --> 01:25:10.373
<i>Okay.-</i>

01:25:11.807 --> 01:25:13.809
I'm sorry, Wardell.

01:25:14.009 --> 01:25:16.080
LaVonda, Hardy will
give me a ride home.

01:25:16.311 --> 01:25:17.722
I'm sure he will.

01:25:19.014 --> 01:25:21.051
Now put your leg back on.

01:25:23.252 --> 01:25:27.098
You see, the Supreme Court
is not the supreme being.

01:25:27.322 --> 01:25:29.928
And I thank the
Good Lord for Texas.

01:25:30.158 --> 01:25:33.162
And I talked to Gail Wade,
our county clerk, today,

01:25:33.362 --> 01:25:36.172
and Tinky Walker,
our Justice of the Peace,

01:25:36.365 --> 01:25:39.073
who's sittin' right back
there, y'all stand up.

01:25:39.268 --> 01:25:41.214
Good Christian warriors.

01:25:41.403 --> 01:25:43.280
They have assured me

01:25:43.505 --> 01:25:46.179
that exercising their
religious freedom

01:25:46.375 --> 01:25:48.412
will no longer allow
same-sex couples

01:25:48.610 --> 01:25:50.715
to get married in
Runnels County.

01:25:50.913 --> 01:25:52.187
And you know what that means.

01:25:52.381 --> 01:25:53.883
Gays can't get
married in the church.

01:25:54.082 --> 01:25:55.425
Whoa-hoe!

01:25:55.617 --> 01:25:57.597
Gays can't get married
in the courthouse.

01:25:57.786 --> 01:26:00.357
No place to get married,
nobody to marry them.

01:26:00.556 --> 01:26:04.902
We have shut out the
sodomites, those pedophiles

01:26:05.093 --> 01:26:08.802
will nu longer persecute
goad God-fearing Christians.

01:26:09.031 --> 01:26:11.204
And tonight I proclaim
that Runnels County

01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:14.210
be a sanctuary county,
free of gay marriage,

01:26:14.403 --> 01:26:16.781
we have stopped equality.

01:26:16.972 --> 01:26:18.383
Oh, no, you haven't.

01:26:20.108 --> 01:26:22.452
Sister, do you have
somethin' to say?

01:26:22.644 --> 01:26:25.648
Oh, yes, brother.
I have plenty to say.

01:26:25.881 --> 01:26:28.919
Well, all right, let's hear what
the good sister has to say.

01:26:30.619 --> 01:26:32.758
Came on, Sissy, grab your Bible.

01:26:32.955 --> 01:26:34.059
I got it.

01:26:42.464 --> 01:26:45.172
My son is gay.

01:26:46.768 --> 01:26:48.941
And, um,
my sweet Aunt Sissy here

01:26:49.137 --> 01:26:51.743
has been doin'
research on his behalf.

01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:54.147
Read the Bible
from cover to cover.

01:26:54.343 --> 01:26:59.122
Sissy, what does Jesus
say about homosexuality?

01:26:59.314 --> 01:27:01.260
Not one blessed word.

01:27:01.450 --> 01:27:03.259
- That is not true.
- Yes, it is.

01:27:03.452 --> 01:27:04.487
First Corinthians.

01:27:04.686 --> 01:27:06.324
That was Paul, not Jesus.

01:27:06.521 --> 01:27:09.832
If you have a degree in
theology, get it right.

01:27:10.025 --> 01:27:11.333
Jesus said nothing.

01:27:12.461 --> 01:27:13.531
Nothing.

01:27:16.098 --> 01:27:19.011
Do you believe in all the Bible?

01:27:19.201 --> 01:27:21.374
Of course we do.

01:27:21.603 --> 01:27:23.514
Then why do you eat bacon?

01:27:23.705 --> 01:27:26.276
Deuteronomy 14:8.

01:27:26.475 --> 01:27:30.617
"And the swine, it is
unclean unto you.

01:27:30.812 --> 01:27:33.691
You shall not eat their flesh."

01:27:36.018 --> 01:27:38.624
The Bible says to all
of us who eat bacon

01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:40.629
and pig's feet,

01:27:40.822 --> 01:27:42.495
and pork chops,

01:27:42.691 --> 01:27:46.969
and Dorito sausage casserole,
that eatin' pork is wrong.

01:27:48.630 --> 01:27:51.304
But bacon is good,
and we eat it 'cause

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:54.310
this scripture don't
make a lick of sense.

01:27:54.503 --> 01:27:59.179
That's the Old Testament,
Jesus gave us the new law.

01:27:59.374 --> 01:28:02.082
That includes me
gettin' to eat bacon.

01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:06.486
Yet Vera, you were
the first to scream amen

01:28:06.682 --> 01:28:08.992
when the pastor read
from the Old Testament,

01:28:09.184 --> 01:28:11.664
"Thou shalt not lie with
mankind as with womankind,

01:28:11.853 --> 01:28:13.264
it is an abomination."

01:28:13.488 --> 01:28:14.768
I've never lied
with a woman once

01:28:14.923 --> 01:28:16.095
the way I lie with you, babe.

01:28:16.324 --> 01:28:18.167
- Stop.
- And the New Testament

01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:20.567
certainly tells
women to be silent.

01:28:20.762 --> 01:28:23.174
And Vera, Mrs. Barnes,

01:28:23.365 --> 01:28:25.504
Hortense,

01:28:25.701 --> 01:28:27.374
y'all never shut up.

01:28:27.569 --> 01:28:30.106
And Tinky, Gail,

01:28:30.338 --> 01:28:33.751
y'all issued three of
my five wedding licenses,

01:28:33.942 --> 01:28:36.718
and adultery is riddled
all over both testaments,

01:28:36.912 --> 01:28:40.291
and says that adulterers
should be stoned to death.

01:28:40.515 --> 01:28:42.085
I demand that you
sit down right now

01:28:42.284 --> 01:28:45.197
and stop hijackin' this
service with your own agenda,

01:28:45.387 --> 01:28:48.231
in support for this deviant,
perverted behavior.

01:28:48.423 --> 01:28:50.369
I am not done.

01:28:50.559 --> 01:28:52.800
And unless you want a
scene that involves kickin'

01:28:53.028 --> 01:28:55.030
and screamin' and scratchin'

01:28:55.230 --> 01:28:57.471
and clawin' out some eyeballs,
and takin' that Bible

01:28:57.699 --> 01:29:00.373
and heatin' you with it the
way you beat people with it,

01:29:00.569 --> 01:29:03.641
then I would advise you
to back off and regroup

01:29:03.872 --> 01:29:05.783
until I am done.

01:29:05.974 --> 01:29:07.248
Go, Latrelle.

01:29:07.442 --> 01:29:09.115
Latrelle's not
normally this violent

01:29:09.311 --> 01:29:11.621
but you have set her off,
so just...

01:29:16.785 --> 01:29:20.494
Sissy, please read the scripture

01:29:20.722 --> 01:29:23.396
that I have chosen
for my sermon.

01:29:26.261 --> 01:29:28.104
"John 4:7.

01:29:30.832 --> 01:29:32.971
"Dear friends,

01:29:33.168 --> 01:29:35.580
let us love one another."

01:29:45.647 --> 01:29:46.819
That's all.

01:29:47.015 --> 01:29:49.291
Simple.

01:29:49.484 --> 01:29:50.758
Just love.

01:29:51.953 --> 01:29:53.694
Says it all, doesn't it?

01:29:57.692 --> 01:29:59.467
My son <i>TY.</i>

01:29:59.661 --> 01:30:01.971
And his husband, Kyle,

01:30:04.032 --> 01:30:08.208
have now gotten married in
every state except Texas.

01:30:08.436 --> 01:30:10.438
Gay activists, they're
called. They did it

01:30:10.639 --> 01:30:15.486
as a publicity thing for Ty's
job, which helps the gays.

01:30:15.677 --> 01:30:20.456
And we taught our son to
fight for what is right.

01:30:20.649 --> 01:30:24.461
And I'm ashamed to say that
I always found a reason

01:30:24.653 --> 01:30:27.532
not to attend their
weddings. And I'm sorry, Ty.

01:30:27.722 --> 01:30:29.167
Kyle, truly sorry.

01:30:30.659 --> 01:30:34.232
I guess because, deep down,

01:30:34.462 --> 01:30:37.966
just went against
everything that I's taught,

01:30:38.166 --> 01:30:40.339
right here in Southside Baptist.

01:30:42.370 --> 01:30:46.216
But then somethin' happened
that changed my heart.

01:30:49.644 --> 01:30:52.022
Ty and Kyle,

01:30:52.214 --> 01:30:53.693
they're gonna be daddies.

01:30:55.383 --> 01:30:57.420
And you, Reverend Brewton,
just preached that gays

01:30:57.652 --> 01:31:00.189
should not he parents,
that they are pedophiles.

01:31:00.388 --> 01:31:02.026
That is the truth.

01:31:02.224 --> 01:31:04.261
Liar! It is so far from it.

01:31:07.028 --> 01:31:09.372
I know my boy.
He is not that.

01:31:11.099 --> 01:31:12.442
He is not capable.

01:31:14.536 --> 01:31:17.107
He has a good heart, pure.

01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:23.514
And you know him too.

01:31:25.013 --> 01:31:26.549
And I know you love him.

01:31:29.084 --> 01:31:31.064
All those sermons
like this one tonight,

01:31:31.253 --> 01:31:35.201
callin' my beautiful son
and his beautiful husband

01:31:35.390 --> 01:31:37.961
pedophiles, abominations,

01:31:38.193 --> 01:31:40.696
sinners, well,

01:31:40.862 --> 01:31:42.034
those sermons are wrong.

01:31:42.230 --> 01:31:43.607
I preach the word of God.

01:31:43.865 --> 01:31:46.971
No, you cherry-pick
what serves your agenda.

01:31:48.370 --> 01:31:51.249
Sissy has proven that tonight.

01:31:51.439 --> 01:31:53.885
And we must stop

01:31:54.075 --> 01:31:58.114
villainizing our own children.

01:31:58.313 --> 01:32:01.817
Tellin' them that they are
not worthy of God's love,

01:32:02.050 --> 01:32:03.552
because they are.

01:32:06.121 --> 01:32:07.623
Just as they are.

01:32:11.059 --> 01:32:15.804
And right now, just down
the street at Bubba's bar,

01:32:15.997 --> 01:32:19.137
they are celebratin'
the life of my mama...

01:32:21.303 --> 01:32:24.147
who did not die from a tumor
that was pressin' against

01:32:24.339 --> 01:32:28.185
the sexual part of her
brain. I lied, okay?

01:32:28.410 --> 01:32:31.118
A real sin,
to cover up the truth.

01:32:33.515 --> 01:32:35.188
But no more cover-ups.

01:32:36.851 --> 01:32:38.797
My son...

01:32:38.987 --> 01:32:40.193
is gay.

01:32:42.757 --> 01:32:44.293
And I am proud of him.

01:32:46.861 --> 01:32:47.965
All of him.

01:32:50.098 --> 01:32:53.375
And so I would like to turn
my mama's celebration of life

01:32:53.601 --> 01:32:57.208
into a celebration of love,
and end this hateful night

01:32:57.439 --> 01:32:59.214

01:32:59.441 --> 01:33:03.150

01:42:25.606 --> 01:42:29.554
Now I think we're all right.
Everybody's good here.

01:42:29.744 --> 01:42:33.123
That's not to say there are
not assholes out there.

01:42:33.347 --> 01:42:34.747
- I warned 'em.
- No, they're there.

01:42:34.916 --> 01:42:36.236
Hey, this is my
kind of preachin'.

01:42:36.350 --> 01:42:38.261
But it's the truth,
it's the truth.

01:42:38.452 --> 01:42:43.231
Bigots, folks who wanna tell
you how to live your lives.

01:42:43.424 --> 01:42:46.268
But I want you son,
to live your life

01:42:46.460 --> 01:42:48.963
with the beautiful man you love.

01:42:49.196 --> 01:42:51.198
And I want the two of you...
What's your name again, girl?

01:42:51.399 --> 01:42:52.935
- LaVonda.
- LaVonda.

01:42:53.134 --> 01:42:54.738
That's a very black name.
And what's your name?

01:42:54.936 --> 01:42:55.971
I'm Wardell.

01:42:56.203 --> 01:42:57.477
Two of 'em, thank you.

01:42:57.705 --> 01:43:00.549
And the two of you,
we want you to live

01:43:00.741 --> 01:43:03.051
in the love that you've
been holdin' for each other

01:43:03.244 --> 01:43:06.225
fur such a lung time.
It's manifesting.

01:43:06.414 --> 01:43:08.291
Because love is here.

01:43:08.482 --> 01:43:12.294
'Cause it's nobody's business,
tellin' you who to love.

01:43:12.486 --> 01:43:14.625
How to love, nobody.

01:43:15.923 --> 01:43:17.903
I wanna welcome you, Ty,

01:43:18.092 --> 01:43:19.572
and you and your
crazy kind of family,

01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:21.137
I love 'em but they're
a little different.

01:43:21.329 --> 01:43:22.569
- Yeah.
- They're a little different.

01:43:22.763 --> 01:43:24.071
But you know what?

01:43:24.265 --> 01:43:25.465
We're celebratin' differences.

01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:27.477

the differences,

01:43:27.668 --> 01:43:29.170
'cause that's what life is.

01:43:29.403 --> 01:43:31.280
That's what love is.

01:43:31.472 --> 01:43:35.113
Now, who wants to go first
when it comes to the vows?

01:43:37.278 --> 01:43:38.814
Well, since this
is our 50th time,

01:43:39.013 --> 01:43:41.994
I think we'll just make ours
short and sweet.

01:43:42.183 --> 01:43:44.686
In my home state of Texas,

01:43:44.919 --> 01:43:47.593
I take you, Kyle Coleman,

01:43:47.788 --> 01:43:52.464

wedded husband, again.

01:43:52.660 --> 01:43:54.435
Ditto.

01:43:55.997 --> 01:43:57.772
All right, all right.

01:43:58.966 --> 01:44:01.344
Princess Diana would approve.

01:44:01.535 --> 01:44:03.310
LaVonda and Wardell.

01:44:03.504 --> 01:44:06.007
Wardell, do you take LaVonda

01:44:06.207 --> 01:44:08.687

01:44:08.876 --> 01:44:09.980

01:44:10.177 --> 01:44:12.783
- Look at him grinnin'.
