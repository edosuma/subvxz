WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.271
I'll see you at the lake.

00:03.937 --> 00:04.938
(gasps)

00:07.007 --> 00:10.778
ANNOUNCER: AHS 1984.
Wednesdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:12.580 --> 00:15.716
FX presents Mr. InBetween.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.641
(clattering)

01:05.966 --> 01:07.968
(insects chirping)

01:43.704 --> 01:46.073
CARLO:
Yeah, I started
the hostility log thing

01:46.106 --> 01:48.075
-this week.
-PETER: How's that working out?

01:48.108 --> 01:50.844
CARLO:
Oh, yeah, good. Yeah. Um...

01:50.878 --> 01:54.348
Had a bit of a situation
Wednesday with somebody.

01:54.382 --> 01:56.684
Yeah, it was just-just some guy

01:56.717 --> 01:58.186
eyeballing me at the pub.

01:58.219 --> 01:59.987
But I was getting pretty pissed,

02:00.020 --> 02:01.822
and I used the stop technique,

02:01.855 --> 02:04.124
you know, we spoke about.
So, yeah.

02:04.158 --> 02:05.659
It's... I'm-I'm getting
pretty good at it,

02:05.693 --> 02:07.861
-so that's good.
-PETER: Great.

02:07.895 --> 02:10.931
Um... Ray, how have you been?

02:10.964 --> 02:12.666
Yeah, good, mate.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.968
-PETER: Yeah?
-Yep.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.306
Is there anything
you want to talk about?

02:18.339 --> 02:20.841
Nah, I'm good.

02:20.874 --> 02:22.376
PETER:
Are you sure?

02:22.410 --> 02:25.479
-Nothing at all?
-(Ray chuckles)

02:25.513 --> 02:29.049
I beat my, uh, girlfriend's
brother up over Christmas.

02:30.318 --> 02:32.320
(inhales deeply)
Okay.

02:32.353 --> 02:34.622
(coughs)
Um...

02:34.655 --> 02:36.690
What happened?

02:36.724 --> 02:39.627
I went round
to her parents' place,

02:39.660 --> 02:41.629
and, um...

02:41.662 --> 02:45.499
Yeah, we did the whole, uh,
Secret Santa thing.

02:45.533 --> 02:47.635
Me daughter got
this unicorn candle,

02:47.668 --> 02:49.637
which she was
pretty chuffed about,

02:49.670 --> 02:52.172
and, uh, me girlfriend's brother
decided he wanted it,

02:52.206 --> 02:55.543
and when it was his turn,
he, uh, took it off her.

02:55.576 --> 02:59.146
-So you assaulted him?
-Well, he was being
a dickhead, so,

02:59.179 --> 03:01.048
-you know.
-PETER: So you assaulted him?

03:01.081 --> 03:03.150
Eh, pretty much.

03:03.183 --> 03:06.654
And how did your girlfriend
feel about this?

03:06.687 --> 03:08.656
Well, she's not my girlfriend
anymore, so...

03:08.689 --> 03:10.157
VINCE:
Shit.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.326
-Sorry, mate.
-Mm.

03:12.360 --> 03:13.894
PETER:
I mean, uh, you know,

03:13.927 --> 03:16.264
without wanting to state
the obvious,

03:16.297 --> 03:19.166
can you see how violence

03:19.199 --> 03:20.701
is perhaps not the best way

03:20.734 --> 03:22.570
for you to resolve
your disputes?

03:24.204 --> 03:26.173
No, I think it generally is.

03:26.206 --> 03:27.508
But, you know, just don't do it

03:27.541 --> 03:29.076
in front of your girlfriend,
you know?

03:29.109 --> 03:30.110
(all chuckle)

03:30.143 --> 03:31.745
PETER:
Uh, what's great

03:31.779 --> 03:33.447
about it? I mean,
it doesn't seem to have worked

03:33.481 --> 03:35.583
-for you this time.
-RAY: Yeah, well,
sometimes it does,

03:35.616 --> 03:36.950
sometimes it doesn't, you know?

03:36.984 --> 03:38.952
PETER:
Can you give me one example

03:38.986 --> 03:41.154
of violence ever working?

03:44.157 --> 03:46.126
World War II.

03:47.160 --> 03:49.029
-World War II.
-RAY: Mm-hmm.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.130
We didn't beat the Nazis

03:50.163 --> 03:51.699
just by talking to them.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.200
We used violence.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.803
PETER:
Okay, sure.
So every now and then,

03:55.836 --> 03:58.806
violence is necessary
as a last resort.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.941
But for you,

04:00.974 --> 04:02.910
uh, with your girlfriend's
brother,

04:02.943 --> 04:06.113
I mean, would you call that
an example of violence working?

04:06.146 --> 04:07.815
Yeah, look, I shouldn't
have done what I did.

04:07.848 --> 04:09.383
You know,
I'm not making excuses.

04:09.417 --> 04:10.984
But I don't think you can say

04:11.018 --> 04:13.253
that all violence is bad.
I mean,

04:13.287 --> 04:16.790
I think there's good violence
and bad violence.

04:18.826 --> 04:20.160
What's good violence?

04:20.193 --> 04:22.596
World War II.

04:23.631 --> 04:25.499
Thanks, Vince.

04:25.533 --> 04:27.768
Um...

04:29.002 --> 04:30.438
-Yeah.
-Uh, all right,

04:30.471 --> 04:31.772
maybe it's about time.

04:31.805 --> 04:34.141
Maybe we should leave it there.

04:34.174 --> 04:36.644
Thank you, everyone.
Thank you.

04:38.178 --> 04:40.180
(grunts)

04:44.284 --> 04:46.286
-(Ray humming a tune)
-NARRATOR (on TV): German
forces had already moved in

04:46.320 --> 04:49.357
and now occupied
the abbey ruins in force.

04:53.661 --> 04:56.330
Here you go, mate.
You can have the fatty bit.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.369
-Mate, you didn't
even chew that.
-Meanwhile, in the town below,

05:01.402 --> 05:03.337
the 28th Maori battalion

05:03.371 --> 05:06.640
had led a successful attack
on the casino railway station,

05:06.674 --> 05:10.043
only to then become trapped
and cut off from their support

05:10.077 --> 05:11.612
across the river.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.647
-(machine guns firing)
-(bullets whizzing)

05:17.150 --> 05:19.152
-MAN: Cheers, love.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.891
(man wolf whistles)

05:23.924 --> 05:25.659
* You're bad *

05:25.693 --> 05:27.495
* Like poison honey... *

05:27.528 --> 05:29.296
Hey.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.631
How you doing?

05:30.664 --> 05:32.299
Good.
What's news?

05:32.332 --> 05:33.401
Not much.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.536
News with you?

05:36.604 --> 05:39.239
Nothing.
You okay?

05:39.272 --> 05:41.008
Yeah.

05:41.041 --> 05:43.010
Okay.

05:43.043 --> 05:45.379
* You're a naughty,
naughty girl *

05:45.413 --> 05:47.881
* And I love it *

05:47.915 --> 05:50.250
* Naughty, naughty,
naughty, naughty. *

05:53.421 --> 05:55.623
(insects chirping)

06:02.463 --> 06:04.432
(sniffs)

06:04.465 --> 06:06.467
(sighs)

06:08.702 --> 06:10.671
(clears throat)

06:10.704 --> 06:12.706
(sniffs)

07:16.036 --> 07:18.038
(rock music ringtone playing)

07:30.183 --> 07:31.819
-Hello?
-VINNIE: Ray.

07:31.852 --> 07:33.954
It's Vinnie.

07:34.988 --> 07:36.590
How you going, mate?

07:36.624 --> 07:38.325
I'm good my friend.
How are you?

07:38.358 --> 07:41.428
-Yeah, good mate. What's news?
-Oh, you know,

07:41.461 --> 07:42.830
same old shit in here, mate.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.932
But listen, I thought
I'd check in and see if you want

07:44.965 --> 07:47.034
to catch up for a beer
or sometime.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.702
Yeah, sounds good, mate.

07:48.736 --> 07:51.038
Yeah.

07:51.071 --> 07:54.141
I'm pretty-pretty busy
this week. Um...

07:54.174 --> 07:55.442
what about next weekend?

07:55.475 --> 07:58.045
Sure, weekend. Oh, fuck.
No, no, no, no, no.

07:58.078 --> 08:00.548
Fuck. No, I got
to go see my folks.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.282
They got a farm up there
in Dorrigo.

08:02.315 --> 08:03.984
So, yeah,
I'll be away all weekend.

08:04.017 --> 08:06.954
Oh, okay. What about-what about
the weekend after that, then?

08:06.987 --> 08:09.389
Weekend after. Sounds great.
Let's shoot for that, eh?

08:09.422 --> 08:11.458
Yeah, mate, I'll keep it free.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.460
All right. You take care
of yourself, brother.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.828
Yeah, same, mate.
Talk to you soon.

08:14.862 --> 08:16.864
-All right, mate.
-See you, mate.

08:45.626 --> 08:46.694
You just gonna leave that there
are you, love?

08:46.727 --> 08:48.428
Excuse me?

08:48.461 --> 08:50.330
Well, your dog just took a shit.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.999
-Are you gonna
clean it up, or...
-So?

08:52.032 --> 08:53.500
You're just gonna leave it
for somebody else

08:53.533 --> 08:56.036
-to stand in, are you?
-Well, if it bothers you so much

08:56.069 --> 08:57.270
why don't you pick it up?

08:57.304 --> 08:59.907
Why don't you fucking
pick it up?

09:01.541 --> 09:03.476
Oh, okay. Yeah.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.423
FREDDY:
Nah, it's been good. I mean,

09:16.456 --> 09:18.692
-it's still early days, but...
-RAY: Mm.

09:18.726 --> 09:20.527
Fuck, last night,

09:20.560 --> 09:22.529
we're lying in bed
and she says to me,

09:22.562 --> 09:25.599
"Who have you had the best sex
of your life with?"

09:25.633 --> 09:29.036
And I'm lying there thinking,
"Fuck, how do I answer this?"

09:29.069 --> 09:30.704
-Mm.
-You know?

09:30.738 --> 09:32.706
Because she's not the bird

09:32.740 --> 09:34.875
I've had the hottest sex with,

09:34.908 --> 09:37.477
but I can't tell her
the best sex I ever had

09:37.510 --> 09:39.813
was with some 52-year-old hooker

09:39.847 --> 09:41.715
-in an alley, you know?
-Mm.

09:41.749 --> 09:45.252
So I have to say something,
and fast,

09:45.285 --> 09:48.055
-Mm.
-so I say... "You!"

09:48.088 --> 09:51.825
Uh, but because I took a second
to answer, she's like,

09:51.859 --> 09:54.728
"Why'd you have to think
about it?" I said,

09:54.762 --> 09:57.798
"I don't know, the question
kind of took me by surprise."

10:00.000 --> 10:01.568
(sighs)

10:01.601 --> 10:03.671
I tell you, mate,
women can ask questions

10:03.704 --> 10:05.939
that scare the shit out of you.

10:05.973 --> 10:08.508
Mm, mm, true.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.581
-So who is this dude, anyway?
-Who?

10:14.614 --> 10:17.417
-This guy.
-Oh, Simon Gillespie.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.186
You know the Gillespies.

10:19.219 --> 10:20.688
-The mining family?
-Yeah.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.322
Oh, okay.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.324
And what's his problem?

10:24.357 --> 10:26.359
He's been having
some lady trouble.

10:26.393 --> 10:27.594
Oh, okay.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.129
Hey.

10:29.162 --> 10:30.798
Uh, Simon's here.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.766
-Do you want to see him now?
-Yeah, yeah.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.001
Bring him in.
Thanks, Mandy.

10:34.034 --> 10:37.705
-You're good.
-Oh, thanks, Mandy.

10:37.738 --> 10:38.839
-FREDDY: G'day, mate. (chuckles)
-SIMON: Hey, Freddy.

10:38.872 --> 10:39.840
FREDDY:
Well, there's a familiar face.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.641
-How are you?
-Good to see you.

10:41.675 --> 10:43.010
(chuckles)
Good to see you too.

10:43.043 --> 10:44.878
-It's been way too long.
-Yes. Yeah.

10:44.912 --> 10:46.780
Uh, Simon, this is Ray.

10:46.814 --> 10:48.448
-SIMON: Hi, Ray.
-How you going, mate?

10:48.481 --> 10:50.784
-Uh... yeah. Yeah, thanks.
-Uh, take a seat.

10:50.818 --> 10:52.953
Um, right.
Why don't you, uh,

10:52.986 --> 10:54.988
-tell Ray your story, mate?
-Straight down to business,
right?

10:55.022 --> 10:56.690
-Yes. Yeah.
-Okay, well, uh,

10:56.724 --> 10:59.526
I was seeing this young lady
for about a year or so.

10:59.559 --> 11:00.894
It was-it was, you know,

11:00.928 --> 11:02.796
it was nothing too serious,
I guess,

11:02.830 --> 11:04.631
from my perspective anyway.

11:04.664 --> 11:08.635
And so, I, uh, stopped seeing
her a few weeks ago, and...

11:08.668 --> 11:10.637
and now she's threatening
to tell my wife.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.572
And, uh, she's threatening,

11:12.605 --> 11:14.341
if I don't pay her
a shitload of cash,

11:14.374 --> 11:15.743
she's gonna talk.

11:15.776 --> 11:17.811
-And how much is she asking for?
-SIMON: Uh, two million.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.747
-Ooh, shit.
-SIMON: Yeah, yeah.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.581
(chuckles): The fucking...
And I told her

11:21.614 --> 11:22.983
I don't have that kind of money.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.752
She won't listen to reason,
all right?

11:24.785 --> 11:26.820
And she-she also said
she's gonna go to the press

11:26.854 --> 11:28.655
and tell them all sorts
of shit about me,

11:28.688 --> 11:30.357
-and none of that's true, okay?
-RAY: Mm.

11:30.390 --> 11:31.992
'Cause with my public profile,

11:32.025 --> 11:35.262
-I-I just...
I can't have that. Right?
-No.

11:35.295 --> 11:38.665
So, she's just, like, being, um,

11:38.698 --> 11:42.770
just totally off her head,
you know?

11:46.039 --> 11:48.708
So what do you want me to do,
mate?

11:48.742 --> 11:51.078
Uh, well, you-you know.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.714
No, I don't.

11:54.748 --> 11:56.016
SIMON:
Well, I want...

11:56.049 --> 11:58.085
I want you to take care of her.

11:58.118 --> 12:00.187
-RAY: Oh, okay.
-Yeah.

12:00.220 --> 12:03.123
Yeah.
So... what you reckon?

12:06.760 --> 12:08.295
Yeah, I'll have
a think about it.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.798
-Have a think about it?
-SIMON: Uh, okay.

12:10.831 --> 12:12.800
So... next...

12:12.833 --> 12:15.202
next week or a few days, or...

12:15.235 --> 12:16.904
-Yeah, a couple of days.
-SIMON: Oh. Great. Great.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.752
FREDDY:
Now this one here,
I've got a bet each way,

12:32.786 --> 12:34.721
'cause that... that means

12:34.754 --> 12:37.825
if it comes first
I'll win a lot of money.

12:37.858 --> 12:41.228
If it comes second or third,
I'll win a little bit of money.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.930
If it doesn't win at all,
I don't get anything,

12:42.963 --> 12:44.898
but that never happens to me,

12:44.932 --> 12:46.900
unless I'm having a bad week.

12:46.934 --> 12:49.903

12:55.108 --> 12:56.676

13:14.694 --> 13:16.864
-Piece of shit!
-Okay. Okay, love.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.465

Thanks.

13:27.875 --> 13:30.878
-Pretty handy with that tray.
-(chuckles)

13:30.911 --> 13:33.881
Mate, I know you're going
through some shit at the moment,

13:33.914 --> 13:34.882
but fuck.

13:34.915 --> 13:35.983
* I just can't do that *

13:36.016 --> 13:36.984
* Give me drinks *

13:37.017 --> 13:38.852

Tell you who was a good fighter.

13:42.522 --> 13:44.892

13:44.925 --> 13:47.294
Yeah. Yeah,
hands of stone, mate.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.728
-Durán, yeah.
-Yeah.

13:48.761 --> 13:50.998
I, um, I read
where Mayweather said

13:51.031 --> 13:53.833
that Durán was his, uh,

13:53.867 --> 13:56.203
number two
on his all-time list.

13:56.236 --> 13:58.305
Mm.
Who was his number one?

13:58.338 --> 13:59.739
Mayweather.

14:02.109 --> 14:05.645
Mayweather was number one on his
own greatest of all-time list?

14:05.678 --> 14:08.015
(laughs):
Yeah.

14:08.048 --> 14:09.649
Oh, fuck.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.885
What a wanker.
Jesus Christ.

14:11.919 --> 14:13.887
He had a perfect record, though.

14:13.921 --> 14:16.156
-What'd he have, 50?
-50. 50 from 50.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.926
-50 from 50. Yeah.
-Yeah. Yep.

14:18.959 --> 14:20.593

14:31.905 --> 14:33.806
34 bucks an hour, I think.

14:35.142 --> 14:36.977
And what else you on?

14:39.279 --> 14:40.780
Just a bit of goey.

14:40.813 --> 14:43.450
Ice?

14:43.483 --> 14:44.952
Just had a little bit, mate.

14:44.985 --> 14:47.187
Just feeling a bit shithouse
since me and Zo split up,

14:47.220 --> 14:48.788
so... you know, pickup.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.691
Get off that shit, mate.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.360
-It'll be all right, Ray.
-No, it won't be

14:53.393 --> 14:55.395
fucking all right, mate. Fucking
get off it.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.565
What, are you the boss
of me now, mate?

14:58.598 --> 14:59.933
Mate...

14:59.967 --> 15:02.936
I vouched for you
to get you the job.

15:02.970 --> 15:04.704
Yeah, I know,
and I appreciate it.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.806
Well, you know...

15:06.839 --> 15:08.675

15:50.883 --> 15:52.852
What's going on
with you and Simon?

15:52.885 --> 15:56.023
-What?
-Well, he said you're trying
to blackmail him.

15:56.056 --> 15:57.657
(scoffs):
What?

15:57.690 --> 16:00.093
I'm not trying to blackmail him.

16:00.127 --> 16:01.428
So why's he saying
that you are, then?

16:01.461 --> 16:03.930
Oh.
I don't know. I mean,

16:03.963 --> 16:05.932
-I-I don't know.
-He said you're asking

16:05.965 --> 16:08.435
for two million bucks
to keep your mouth shut.

16:08.468 --> 16:09.869
(sighs)

16:11.304 --> 16:14.274
Look, I... I asked him
for $1,000 a month,

16:14.307 --> 16:16.976
till the baby turn...
till she turns 18.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.048
Oh, my...

16:21.081 --> 16:22.515
Did he...

16:38.098 --> 16:39.866
(engine stops)

16:52.412 --> 16:54.381
-Nice house, mate.
-Jesus Christ.

16:54.414 --> 16:56.949
Oh, you scared
the shit out of me.

16:58.218 --> 17:00.753
-How'd you know where I live?
-Hey, listen, mate,

17:00.787 --> 17:03.256
I talked to Fiona,
and I got her down

17:03.290 --> 17:05.725
-to 250 grand.
-You...

17:05.758 --> 17:07.494
-you spoke to her?
-Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

17:07.527 --> 17:10.029
-You can afford 250, yeah?
-Uh, y...

17:10.063 --> 17:12.732
Yeah, look, listen, um...

17:12.765 --> 17:14.767
-thanks, yeah?
-Yeah.

17:14.801 --> 17:16.503
But don't worry about it.
I'll-I'll deal with that.

17:16.536 --> 17:17.770
-Oh. Okay.
-Yeah.

17:19.239 --> 17:21.108
I think you should
pay the money, mate.

17:21.141 --> 17:22.742
W...
(scoffs)

17:22.775 --> 17:25.112
Why would I want to do that?

17:25.145 --> 17:27.380
'Cause I know she's pregnant.

17:27.414 --> 17:29.749
Ah. Uh... look, I, w-w...
Look, w...

17:29.782 --> 17:31.751
Okay, um...

17:31.784 --> 17:34.020
Listen, the thing is...

17:34.053 --> 17:36.123
she's batshit crazy.

17:36.156 --> 17:37.724
-She-She's...
-Let me stop you there,
mate, okay?

17:37.757 --> 17:39.126
Pay the money.

17:39.159 --> 17:41.528

17:41.561 --> 17:43.029
What?

17:43.062 --> 17:45.132
-You heard what I said.
-Wh-Wh...

17:45.165 --> 17:47.434
what happens if I don't?

17:47.467 --> 17:48.868
(chuckles)

17:48.901 --> 17:50.903
You really want to find out?

17:52.339 --> 17:53.973
All right.

(clears throat)

18:25.838 --> 18:27.974
What's going on?

18:28.007 --> 18:29.376
Alex wants to know
what's taking so long.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.079
Well, if he's not happy, mate,
he can have his money back

18:33.112 --> 18:35.182
and find somebody else
to do the job.

18:35.215 --> 18:38.117
-I didn't say he wasn't happy.
-Mm.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.087
He just wants to know
what the holdup is.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.089
Yeah, well, Vinnie's
got good security, mate,

18:43.122 --> 18:45.258
and he's not easy
to get to, so,

18:45.292 --> 18:46.859
-you know...
-(tires screech in distance)

18:48.661 --> 18:51.097
Anyway, his parents
have got a farm...

18:51.130 --> 18:53.099

this weekend,

18:53.132 --> 18:56.169

23:12.391 --> 23:14.727
What? Well, can it
not be the face?

23:14.761 --> 23:16.463
-It's gotta be the face.
-Why?

23:16.496 --> 23:18.431
It's gotta be somewhere
