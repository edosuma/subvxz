Oh, boy! Here it is!

My lost coupon!

01:46.239 --> 01:49.507
I found it!

01:51.711 --> 01:54.412
You have fought well today,
sea spider,

01:54.414 --> 01:55.346

Hey, Patrick.

02:17.770 --> 02:19.604

- That's nice of you, buddy,
but I already got an ice cream.

02:23.743 --> 02:24.342
- Uh...

02:24.344 --> 02:27.478
but I'm getting you

02:27.480 --> 02:29.847
- Why would ya?
I already got one.

02:30.617 --> 02:33.718

02:33.720 --> 02:37.722
- Wow.
There goes the nicest guy.

02:46.265 --> 02:47.999
Whoa.

02:48.001 --> 02:48.966
- Hooray!

02:48.968 --> 02:50.868
I win a free coupon!

02:50.870 --> 02:54.705
- H-how did you know
about my free coupon?

02:54.707 --> 02:55.806
- Me back knows.

02:55.808 --> 02:59.744
It breaks out in hives
around anything free.

02:59.746 --> 03:00.611
- Guh.

03:00.613 --> 03:02.313
- I also know how heavy

03:02.315 --> 03:04.282
a free ice cream coupon can be.

03:04.284 --> 03:06.851
- It's heavy?

03:08.288 --> 03:12.890
- Much too much responsibility
for a carefree fellow like you.

03:13.893 --> 03:14.625
- Tell you what.

03:14.627 --> 03:16.694
I'll take that free coupon
off your hands

03:16.696 --> 03:19.597
for the price
of a hearty handshake.

03:19.599 --> 03:21.532
- Uh...

03:21.534 --> 03:22.533
Oh.

03:22.535 --> 03:24.001
Ohh!

03:24.003 --> 03:26.003
Oh!

03:26.005 --> 03:28.806
SpongeBob does love handshakes.

03:28.808 --> 03:31.609
- You should be ashamed
of yourself!

03:31.611 --> 03:35.079
Taking advantage of a simpleton.

03:35.081 --> 03:35.813
- Ahh, come on.

03:35.815 --> 03:39.550
Can't an old crab have a little
unscrupulous fun anymore?

03:39.552 --> 03:41.085
- Hey, you ruined my deal!

03:41.087 --> 03:43.588
I almost had a handshake!

03:45.692 --> 03:47.658
- Oh, you dingdong
wing nut!

03:47.660 --> 03:50.695
Krabs was just trying
to steal your coupon!

03:50.697 --> 03:53.364
- Steal my coupon?

03:53.366 --> 03:54.432
Hmm.

03:59.005 --> 04:00.671
- You want my ice cream coupon!

04:00.673 --> 04:01.672
You can't have it!

04:01.674 --> 04:03.341
- Okay. Whatever.

04:03.343 --> 04:06.010
- He never really knew
how to sing.

04:06.012 --> 04:07.612
- No! Singers?

04:07.614 --> 04:09.013
- You.
Hmm?

04:09.015 --> 04:10.648
- Oh, I see you...

04:10.650 --> 04:12.750
peeking at my coupon!

04:12.752 --> 04:14.885
It's for SpongeBob's
ice cream!

04:14.887 --> 04:16.721
- Hooray for SpongeBob.

04:16.723 --> 04:18.488
- Hey, what's going on?

04:18.491 --> 04:20.358
- Get away from me!
All of you!

04:20.360 --> 04:23.995
You're all after my coupon!

04:24.797 --> 04:30.501
Coupon! Coupon!
Coupon! Coupon!

04:30.503 --> 04:35.706
Coupon! Coupon! Coupon!
Coupon!

04:35.708 --> 04:38.509
- No! You can't have my coupon!

04:38.511 --> 04:40.044
No! No!

04:40.046 --> 04:41.779
-<i> Officer Slugfish?</i>

04:41.781 --> 04:45.683
<i>We got a call about a sea star</i>
<i>disturbance on your beat.</i>

04:45.685 --> 04:46.684
<i>Please investigate.</i>

04:46.686 --> 04:48.653
- Roger, headquarters.

04:48.655 --> 04:50.054
Hey, you.

04:51.723 --> 04:54.458
Headquarters?
I couldn't catch him.

04:54.460 --> 04:56.527
He got away.

05:00.465 --> 05:02.667
- You're a bad baby!

05:04.837 --> 05:08.572
Whaa!

05:12.011 --> 05:12.843
- Oh, look, honey,

05:12.845 --> 05:16.747
it's Bikini Bottom's
Sidewalk of the Stars.

05:18.917 --> 05:20.618
- This one's gruesome.

05:20.620 --> 05:23.120
Hmm, looks like
some kids' cartoon.

05:23.122 --> 05:24.588
Should we take a photo?

05:24.590 --> 05:28.426
- Nah, waste of film.

05:29.562 --> 05:30.194
Ooh.

05:30.196 --> 05:32.997
Ah! Come back!

05:32.999 --> 05:35.666
Ah!

05:35.668 --> 05:36.767
I made it.

05:39.539 --> 05:41.205
It's beautiful.

05:46.779 --> 05:48.913
- And a good ice cream day
to you, sir.

05:48.915 --> 05:52.683
- Yes, it's a good day
for ice cream!

05:52.685 --> 05:54.685
- And what's your pleasure?

05:54.687 --> 05:58.022
- Oh, I want your bestest
ice cream

05:58.024 --> 06:01.525
for my bestest buddy, SpongeBob!

06:01.527 --> 06:02.326
- Excellent choice, sir.

06:02.328 --> 06:05.996
One Heavenly Paradise coming up.

06:19.846 --> 06:24.982
- SpongeBob won't mind
if I just take a little taste.

06:26.085 --> 06:28.219
- Aw, this coupon's out of date.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.653
Expired two years ago.

06:29.655 --> 06:32.623
Sorry, we can't honor it.

06:32.625 --> 06:35.659
- No ice cream for SpongeBob?

06:35.661 --> 06:36.260
Uh!

06:43.135 --> 06:48.239
I demand that you honor
my coupon!

06:50.076 --> 06:52.643
- Temper tantrum
in center aisle!

06:52.645 --> 06:54.879
- I'm on it.

06:54.881 --> 06:57.148
- Take my coupon!

06:57.150 --> 06:57.948
Take my coupon.

06:57.950 --> 07:00.985
Take my coupon. Take my coupon.

07:00.987 --> 07:01.919
Ah, take my--

07:01.921 --> 07:05.089
- You poor, miserable creature.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.091
- I'm miserable.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.726
- You wretched, worthless,
shabby--

07:08.728 --> 07:12.797
- Hey, don't you think
you're being a little harsh?

07:12.799 --> 07:14.064
- Not really.

07:14.066 --> 07:15.166
Look at him.

07:16.936 --> 07:17.968
- Yeah. Never mind.

07:17.970 --> 07:20.971
Continue and bump it up
a little bit.

07:23.608 --> 07:24.275
- Listen, buddy,

07:24.277 --> 07:27.745
there is one person
who can honor this coupon;

07:27.747 --> 07:30.014
the person who owns this store.

07:30.016 --> 07:33.684
The Ice Cream King himself.

07:33.686 --> 07:35.920
- The Ice Cream King?

07:35.922 --> 07:36.654
- Oh, yeah.

07:36.656 --> 07:38.889
He lives up there
in that mansion.

07:38.891 --> 07:40.057
- Wow.

07:40.059 --> 07:41.292
- Do you need a push?

07:41.294 --> 07:45.095
- Yeah.
Would you, please?

07:47.566 --> 07:48.866
Whoa.

07:53.239 --> 07:54.605
Hello?

07:59.912 --> 08:01.812
- Are you the exterminator?

08:01.814 --> 08:03.614
- Oh.
No.

08:03.616 --> 08:04.915
I'm not the extra gator.

08:04.917 --> 08:08.586
I'm here to redeem my coupon
for a free ice cream!

08:08.588 --> 08:11.856
It's for my bestest friend,
but it's out of date.

08:11.858 --> 08:14.825
- They're all out of date
because I don't know

08:14.827 --> 08:15.493
what year it is.

08:15.495 --> 08:19.363
- I don't know
what anything is.

08:20.365 --> 08:24.335
- Are you smart or dumb?

08:24.337 --> 08:25.836
- Apples?

08:25.838 --> 08:27.271
- Genius!

08:27.273 --> 08:29.773
Let's see your head.

08:29.775 --> 08:32.142
I can't feel your brain.

08:32.144 --> 08:34.678
- It's down here today.

08:34.679 --> 08:37.047
- Mine too!

08:37.049 --> 08:38.015
High five!

08:38.985 --> 08:40.885
Secret handshake?

08:48.326 --> 08:48.926
Perfect!

08:48.928 --> 08:52.296
You don't know
the secret handshake either.

08:52.298 --> 08:55.099
Hey, I don't know your name.

08:55.801 --> 08:57.101
- Hey, you're right!

08:57.870 --> 09:03.807
- This may still be redeemable
according to the fine print.

09:06.045 --> 09:09.079
I didn't bring my reading eyes.

09:09.081 --> 09:11.382
- Try my glasses!

09:12.418 --> 09:14.318
- Oh, ooh.

09:14.320 --> 09:17.087
It says "garbaldy goop."

09:17.089 --> 09:20.691
- But spelled backwards is...

09:21.960 --> 09:25.029
<i>The King's Challenge!</i>

09:25.764 --> 09:28.399
Hair growing contest!

09:34.439 --> 09:36.140
Ah-ha!

09:36.142 --> 09:37.408
- Wow.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.876
Oh...

09:45.383 --> 09:46.717
Ow.

09:46.719 --> 09:47.918
- That's sad.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.687
Watch this.

09:56.194 --> 09:58.195
Try beating that.

09:58.197 --> 10:00.297
- Oh, man.

10:08.907 --> 10:11.208
- Ha ha!
I beat you.

10:11.210 --> 10:14.078
- Not so fast.

10:14.080 --> 10:14.778
Ha!

10:14.780 --> 10:18.282
Can I redeem my coupon now?

10:18.284 --> 10:20.951
- Not just yet.

10:20.953 --> 10:22.019
Best two out of three.

10:25.224 --> 10:27.324
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

10:27.525 --> 10:30.427
Your butterscotch style
is strong, Low Fat,

10:30.429 --> 10:33.831
but it is no match
for my brownie bits!

10:33.833 --> 10:34.531
- Ha, ha, ha!

10:34.533 --> 10:36.467
You'll wish your cone was a cup

10:36.469 --> 10:39.136
when I whip you into cream!

10:39.138 --> 10:40.270
Hi-ya!

10:53.151 --> 10:55.386
They told me you had scoops,

10:55.388 --> 10:56.887
but your serve is soft.

10:56.889 --> 11:00.257
I see you've studied
the ancient art of failure!

11:00.259 --> 11:01.091
- Oh!

11:01.093 --> 11:03.861
- Redeem my coupon!

11:03.863 --> 11:04.928
- Think fast--

11:04.930 --> 11:08.065
rainbow sprinkles!

11:09.068 --> 11:11.301
- You have played with skill

11:11.303 --> 11:12.002
and courage.

11:12.004 --> 11:14.338
I will honor your coupon.

11:18.877 --> 11:22.813
- One free ice cream cone!

11:27.520 --> 11:29.420
- Oh, hello, Patrick.
What's up?

11:29.422 --> 11:32.790
- I was gonna give you
this ice cream,

11:32.792 --> 11:33.490
but it melted.

11:33.492 --> 11:36.994
Instead, I got you
this hearty handshake.

11:36.996 --> 11:38.562
- Aw, I love
hearty handshakes,

11:38.564 --> 11:41.565
but not as much
as I love ice cream!

11:44.103 --> 11:46.170
Care to join me?

11:46.172 --> 11:48.105
Whoo-hoo!

12:01.320 --> 12:03.721
- Ladies and gentlemen!

12:03.723 --> 12:08.425
Behold my wondrous paintings!

12:13.199 --> 12:15.265
- Um, excuse me.
Can I have some ketchup?

12:15.267 --> 12:17.634
- Hey, look at my art,
you dummies!

12:17.636 --> 12:19.169
- Oh!

12:19.171 --> 12:22.506
- I don't know how you talked me
into this art show, SpongeBob,

12:22.508 --> 12:25.709
but I'm shutting this thing down
right now.

12:25.711 --> 12:27.010
- Aw, you can't, Mr. Krabs.

12:27.012 --> 12:29.546
Wait until Squidward sells
some of his paintings.

12:29.548 --> 12:31.281
- Buy some important paintings.

12:31.283 --> 12:34.718
See me expose my exquisite
suffering.

12:34.720 --> 12:37.221
Hmm.
These fools don't even recognize

12:37.223 --> 12:39.223
the masterworks
in front of their faces.

12:39.225 --> 12:43.660
I'll confront them
with the power of my art.

12:43.662 --> 12:46.663
- Ahh--
- Witness the beauty!

12:46.665 --> 12:48.365
- Pah!

12:48.367 --> 12:49.466
- Come on, Larry,

12:49.468 --> 12:50.400
get your salad on!

12:50.402 --> 12:53.670
- Come on, Larry,
get your art on!

12:53.672 --> 12:55.706
- Oohee!
My eyes!

12:58.043 --> 13:00.444
The pain!

13:02.614 --> 13:04.014
- I want a Kwabby Meal!

13:04.016 --> 13:07.484
- How about some art
to go with that?

13:12.658 --> 13:15.025
Run, baby, run!

13:15.027 --> 13:18.595
- That's it! Squidward is
scaring me customers away.

13:18.597 --> 13:20.764
I'm shutting this art show down.

13:20.766 --> 13:23.033
He's never gonna
sell his paintings.

13:23.035 --> 13:25.702
- Sure, he will.
I just bought one.

13:25.704 --> 13:27.204
- Ah! Holy shrimp.

13:27.206 --> 13:29.473
Why would you do that
to yourself?

13:29.475 --> 13:31.341
- What do you mean? I love it.

13:31.343 --> 13:32.109
- Ah.

13:32.111 --> 13:35.045
- Mr. Krabs,
Squidward is our friend,

13:35.047 --> 13:36.747
and his paintings are so cheap.

13:36.749 --> 13:39.516
You should buy one
just to be nice.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.152
I'm good.

13:42.154 --> 13:44.354
- Nice?
Nice?

13:44.356 --> 13:46.723
I don't waste my money on <i> nice.</i>

13:46.725 --> 13:50.294
- But think about how valuable
these paintings might become.

13:50.296 --> 13:51.728
- Valuable?
What do you mean?

13:51.730 --> 13:55.699
- When art gets older,
it usually gets more expensive.

13:55.701 --> 13:59.570
Squidward's paintings
might be worth millions someday.

13:59.572 --> 14:01.405
- Millions?

14:01.407 --> 14:02.840
Out of me way!

14:02.842 --> 14:06.109
Here!
- Ow.

14:06.111 --> 14:06.677
- Gimme.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.312
This is mine now!

14:08.314 --> 14:09.146
- Okay, Mr. Krabs!

14:09.148 --> 14:11.515
Art, art, art, art, art, art.

14:11.517 --> 14:13.684
Now all I need to do is sit back

14:13.686 --> 14:17.621
and watch me art
grow more valuable.

14:19.358 --> 14:22.826
- I am a very important
art appraiser,

14:22.828 --> 14:25.262
and I say this so-called "art"

14:25.264 --> 14:26.597
will never be worth a penny.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.765
- Hey, Eugene H. Krabs
does not--

14:28.767 --> 14:31.368
Lose money.

14:31.370 --> 14:33.370
There must be
something I can do

14:33.372 --> 14:36.540
to make this art
worth lots more cash.

14:36.542 --> 14:37.808
- Hmm...

14:37.810 --> 14:39.309
- I sold all my art?

14:39.311 --> 14:44.581
This tiny handful of coins
has legitimized me!

14:44.782 --> 14:49.553
Who wants the autograph
of a real artiste?

14:51.590 --> 14:54.524
- Ahh!

14:54.526 --> 14:55.125
- Well,

14:55.127 --> 14:57.895
paintings can become
much more valuable

14:57.897 --> 15:01.265
when the artist
is not longer with us.

15:01.267 --> 15:04.368
You know, out of the picture.

15:05.437 --> 15:08.305
- Out of the picture, eh?

15:08.307 --> 15:10.507
I think I could arrange that.

15:10.509 --> 15:13.644
- Artist walking--
check me out.

15:13.646 --> 15:14.478
- Check this out.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.546
Got a delivery for you,
Mr. Squidward.

15:16.548 --> 15:18.282
- What? You can't be serious.

15:18.284 --> 15:21.852
An artist, such as myself,
should not be subject

15:21.854 --> 15:23.654
to such menial tasks.

15:23.656 --> 15:26.823
Aw, don't be menial
to Squidward, Mr. Krabs.

15:26.825 --> 15:28.358
I'll take the delivery.

15:28.360 --> 15:28.926
- No.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.528
Mr. Squidward is
a real artist now,

15:31.530 --> 15:36.233
and real artists
can handle anything.

15:36.902 --> 15:39.770
- The Arctic is so cold.

15:41.907 --> 15:43.440
Come on, Squidward,

15:43.442 --> 15:45.309
you're a strong artist.

15:45.311 --> 15:47.544
You can do it!

15:47.546 --> 15:49.479
Nope.

15:51.884 --> 15:52.582
SpongeBob?

15:52.584 --> 15:53.850
- Oh, hey, Squidward!
- Ah!

15:53.852 --> 15:55.886
SpongeBob,
what are you doing here?

15:55.888 --> 15:57.454
- Just getting some ice.

15:57.456 --> 15:59.256
Fresh!

15:59.958 --> 16:02.426
Need some help?

16:02.428 --> 16:02.893
Oh!

16:07.298 --> 16:10.467
- Here's your food.

16:14.539 --> 16:18.575
- Hey, this is cold!

16:18.577 --> 16:19.609
Perfect!

16:19.611 --> 16:23.847
- Dah!

16:23.849 --> 16:26.817
- Eh, we better get you home.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.920
- Hello.
Is this the art appraiser?

16:29.922 --> 16:30.921
Just wanted to let you know

16:30.923 --> 16:34.458
that me good, good friend
Squidward is now

16:34.460 --> 16:35.826
out of the pictu--

16:35.828 --> 16:38.228
Wha-what the sea horse?

16:38.230 --> 16:40.731
Got another delivery for you,
Squidward.

16:40.733 --> 16:42.666
And only Squidward!

16:42.668 --> 16:44.735
- Your eyes are so pretty.

16:49.273 --> 16:50.407
- Last...

16:50.409 --> 16:51.441
Stop...

16:51.443 --> 16:52.476
Rock...

16:52.478 --> 16:56.546
Bottom.

17:02.821 --> 17:05.422
- 237 Rock Bottom.

17:05.424 --> 17:07.023
Oh, there it is!

17:07.026 --> 17:08.358
Oh, remember, Squidward,

17:08.359 --> 17:11.728
real artists
embrace the unknown.

17:11.730 --> 17:13.696
Uh, is anyone here?

17:13.699 --> 17:15.665
I've got a delivery

17:15.666 --> 17:17.733
from the Krusty...

17:17.736 --> 17:18.402
Krab.

17:21.373 --> 17:22.839
- What are we screaming about?

17:22.840 --> 17:23.773
- Monsters!

17:23.776 --> 17:25.541
- They're not monsters,
Squidward,

17:25.544 --> 17:26.476
they're my friends.

17:26.478 --> 17:27.611
- What...

17:27.613 --> 17:28.678
Up...

17:28.680 --> 17:30.480
SpongeBob?

17:33.552 --> 17:35.786
- Yes, I am sure
that Mr. Squidward

17:35.788 --> 17:37.354
is out of the picture for good.

17:37.356 --> 17:38.121
He will be missed.

17:38.123 --> 17:39.890
So come on over
and tell old Krabs

17:39.892 --> 17:42.659
how much money
me paintings are worth.

17:52.471 --> 17:55.338
Squidward, delivery!

17:55.340 --> 17:57.507
- Ooh, this tickles.

17:58.410 --> 17:59.509
Follow me, Mr. Squidward.

17:59.511 --> 18:02.079
I've got a special delivery
vehicle

18:02.081 --> 18:04.948
just for a great artist
like yourself.

18:04.950 --> 18:07.017
- Well, that's more like it.

18:07.019 --> 18:08.952
Finally some respect.

18:08.954 --> 18:10.687
- Into the rocket you go.

18:10.689 --> 18:11.888
- Ah!
Ooh.

18:11.890 --> 18:13.657
Wait, why do I need a rocket?

18:13.659 --> 18:15.659
Where is this delivery to?

18:15.661 --> 18:16.660
- Mars.

18:16.662 --> 18:18.395
- Oh, Mars. Well--

18:18.397 --> 18:20.063
M-M-M-Mars?

18:20.065 --> 18:21.431
- Bye, Squidward.

18:28.440 --> 18:31.842
- Delivery from the Krusty Krab.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.986
- Hmm.
All this red, so garish.

18:42.988 --> 18:46.756
Ah, this dump needs
a true artist's touch.

18:51.396 --> 18:52.896
- So now that Squidward
definitely,

18:52.898 --> 18:55.465
100% is gone for good--
what a shame--

18:55.467 --> 18:58.135
what do you think
of these here paintings?

18:58.137 --> 18:59.903
- Well, of course,
they're awful,

18:59.905 --> 19:02.539
but if the so-called "artist"

19:02.541 --> 19:03.940
is really out of the picture,

19:03.942 --> 19:06.743
then perhaps
they're worth something.

19:06.745 --> 19:07.444
- Really?

19:07.446 --> 19:09.479
It's so complicated.

19:09.481 --> 19:13.150
These are tears of joy, but
they're also tears of sadness

19:13.152 --> 19:15.685
for my good friend Squidward,

19:15.687 --> 19:16.720
wherever he is.

19:16.722 --> 19:19.623
- Oh, there he is, Mr. Krabs.

19:21.527 --> 19:25.862
- Stay here and keep an eye
on me investments.

19:32.770 --> 19:34.838
Well, that was disgusting.

19:34.840 --> 19:38.708
So who wants to talk about
my use of color

19:38.710 --> 19:40.677
and brush stroke?

19:42.514 --> 19:43.647
Hm!

19:43.649 --> 19:45.782
- I have done everything I could

19:45.784 --> 19:47.984
to get you away from here
safely.

19:47.986 --> 19:50.020
- Ah!
- Now you're messing

19:50.022 --> 19:52.422
with me money!

19:52.424 --> 19:52.923
- Dah!

19:52.925 --> 19:54.558
- Run, Squidward, run!

19:54.560 --> 19:55.125
- Hey!

19:55.127 --> 19:57.594
How about a little support here?

19:57.596 --> 19:59.496
- Run, Mr. Krabs, run!

20:00.098 --> 20:03.934
- But a little slower
than Squidward!

20:10.876 --> 20:13.577
- It's your best friend,

20:13.579 --> 20:14.444
SpongeBob.

20:15.781 --> 20:17.047
- Oh, get off of me!

20:17.049 --> 20:19.115
- I'll never get off of you,
Squidward.

20:19.117 --> 20:20.617
Not until you're safe.

20:20.619 --> 20:22.085
- I'll never be safe!

20:22.087 --> 20:23.954
Not until my paintings are gone.

20:23.956 --> 20:24.688
- No, Squidward!

20:24.690 --> 20:26.623
You can't deprive the world
of your paintings!

20:26.625 --> 20:30.894
- True, but it's better than
depriving the world of me.

20:30.896 --> 20:31.695
Hmm?

20:31.697 --> 20:33.530
- Ah!

20:35.033 --> 20:37.601
- Come on, Squidward,
destroy those paintings

20:37.603 --> 20:39.836
before Mr. Krabs gets back.

20:41.740 --> 20:43.907
I--I can't do it!

20:43.909 --> 20:46.843
They're just too magnificent!

20:46.845 --> 20:48.511
- Hey, hey, hey!

20:48.513 --> 20:49.946
Get away from me paintings!

20:49.948 --> 20:54.217
- Oh, I'm sorry, paintings,
but it's you or me!

20:57.055 --> 20:58.888
- Yes. Yes!

20:58.890 --> 21:01.691
Now this is true art!

21:01.693 --> 21:02.392
- Wha--really?

21:02.394 --> 21:05.996
- So visceral, so dangerous.

21:05.998 --> 21:07.230
- Yes!

21:07.232 --> 21:09.266
Feel my art!

21:10.736 --> 21:14.771
- Leave me paintings alone,
you monster!

21:14.773 --> 21:15.338
- No!

21:15.340 --> 21:18.275
That was the most exhilarating
performance art

21:18.277 --> 21:20.543
I have ever seen!

21:20.545 --> 21:21.111
- Really?

21:21.113 --> 21:24.214
So it must be worth millions!

21:24.216 --> 21:25.915
Hey, out of me way!

21:35.627 --> 21:37.160
Mr. Krabs, uh, Squidward,

21:37.162 --> 21:38.795
I don't think
you should be doing that.

21:38.797 --> 21:41.898
- Oh, don't be so provincial,
SpongeBob.

21:41.900 --> 21:45.602
- Yeah, stop trying
to censor our money!

21:45.604 --> 21:47.137
I mean, our art!

21:54.245 --> 21:55.845
There!

22:00.651 --> 22:01.851
- Bravo!

22:01.853 --> 22:04.321
Bravo! Bravo!

22:09.660 --> 22:12.629
- Ooh, boy, hee-hee!

22:12.631 --> 22:13.663
So, heh,

22:13.665 --> 22:15.865
how much you gonna give me
for all this?

22:15.867 --> 22:17.567
- Nothing!

22:17.569 --> 22:20.270
Performance art is about
the moment.

22:20.272 --> 22:21.905
You cannot put a price on it.

22:21.907 --> 22:24.607
- What?
Wait. Come back here,

22:24.609 --> 22:27.177
you double-crossing--

22:27.179 --> 22:30.747
- Doh! Mr. Krabs!
Squidward!

22:31.850 --> 22:34.217
- A-ha!

22:34.219 --> 22:38.755
And that is how I acquired
this masterpiece.

22:38.757 --> 22:40.790
- Ooh.
- Ahh.

22:40.792 --> 22:41.891
- Bravo.

22:41.893 --> 22:43.927
- I'm an artist.

22:43.929 --> 22:45.929
- I'm rich.

22:45.931 --> 22:49.866
- And I helped.
