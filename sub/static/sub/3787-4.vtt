00:01.267 --> 00:03.435
Earl, can I borrow
your paper?

00:03.437 --> 00:04.970
I want to check my horoscope

00:04.972 --> 00:08.474
to see if I'll still be
a whore in the future.

00:08.476 --> 00:10.376
All right, who
wants to go first?

00:10.378 --> 00:13.045
Ooh, do me. Do me.
Do me.

00:13.047 --> 00:15.014
Can we have one night
at the diner

00:15.016 --> 00:18.317
that doesn't end with you
yelling that at a woman?

00:18.319 --> 00:19.618
All right, I'll go.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.353
"Gemini, the twins,"

00:21.355 --> 00:24.556
and they're both doing fine,
so let's move on.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.225
Han, what sign are you?

00:26.227 --> 00:29.962
I'm guessing
the 40-year-old Virgo.

00:29.964 --> 00:31.563
Max, you don't need
that paper.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.298
I'll tell you
what's in your future--

00:33.300 --> 00:36.368
using my name as a reference
at chipotle.

00:38.705 --> 00:41.173
You guys really believe
in that crap?

00:41.175 --> 00:43.308
They just tell you
what you want to hear.

00:43.310 --> 00:46.178
"You will be rich.
You will be famous."

00:46.180 --> 00:48.313
You'd think I'd buy
a newspaper if it said,

00:48.315 --> 00:51.583
"you will be
a 75-year-old cashier"?

01:05.532 --> 01:06.899
okay, ready to open?

01:06.901 --> 01:08.267
Never have been,
never will be.

01:08.269 --> 01:09.568
Let's do this.

01:09.570 --> 01:10.903
Wait.

01:10.905 --> 01:13.338
We have to do
our business affirmation.

01:13.340 --> 01:17.676
Please, god, don't let us
be murdered in here.

01:17.678 --> 01:19.411
All right,
let's open 'em up.

01:20.447 --> 01:22.848
Oh, hell no.
- Max.

01:22.850 --> 01:23.849
Hang on.
I wasn't done.

01:23.851 --> 01:27.252
Oh, hell no!

01:27.254 --> 01:29.621
Oh, she's yarn-bombing
that bike.

01:29.623 --> 01:30.956
It's whimsical.
It's new.

01:30.958 --> 01:33.058
It's stupid.

01:33.060 --> 01:35.561
Graffiti, I get.

01:35.563 --> 01:37.596
I see, "die, bitch. Die,"
on a wall,

01:37.598 --> 01:39.731
I think, "okay,
this gentleman

01:39.733 --> 01:41.800
wanted to get that
off his chest."

01:41.802 --> 01:45.404
But this yarn-ival
is pathetic.

01:45.406 --> 01:47.806
Yo, yarnie.

01:47.808 --> 01:49.608
I have a name.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.610
It's Guinevere.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.979
Yep, that checks out.

01:53.981 --> 01:55.314
What's happening
over here?

01:55.316 --> 01:57.082
Why are you molesting
that poor bike?

01:57.084 --> 01:59.284
Well...

01:59.286 --> 02:00.886
I am beautifying the city

02:00.888 --> 02:04.022
one living, glorious work
of art at a time.

02:04.024 --> 02:06.191
And tips are always
appreciated.

02:06.193 --> 02:07.860
[Scoffs]

02:07.862 --> 02:09.795
Here's a tip:

02:09.797 --> 02:11.797
Go back to school
and learn a trade

02:11.799 --> 02:14.700
before daddy's money
runs out.

02:14.702 --> 02:15.901
Well, I never--

02:15.903 --> 02:18.303
worked a day in your life,
we know.

02:18.305 --> 02:20.205
You think this
is artwork?

02:20.207 --> 02:24.076
Artwork is a Garfield mug,
sweetheart.

02:24.078 --> 02:25.911
You got Garfield
in a hammock, saying,

02:25.913 --> 02:27.646
"I'm not overweight.
I'm under-tall,"

02:27.648 --> 02:30.549
I'll build you a gallery
right here.

02:32.318 --> 02:33.852
Look, you should
move on.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.320
My friend doesn't
want you--

02:35.322 --> 02:36.755
how shall I put this?

02:36.757 --> 02:40.425
Taking a giant knit
in front of our shop.

02:40.427 --> 02:42.995
What is the problem?
It is not even your bike.

02:42.997 --> 02:45.063
It's been chained here
for, like, four months.

02:45.065 --> 02:46.765
Oh, yeah?

02:46.767 --> 02:48.767
Maybe it is our bike,

02:48.769 --> 02:51.770
and we use it
for deliveries

02:51.772 --> 02:54.239
and to trap nerds.

02:55.742 --> 02:56.942
Peace out,
ganja beer,

02:56.944 --> 02:58.477
before I knit you
a noose.

03:02.115 --> 03:04.183
Max, that was
a great idea.

03:04.185 --> 03:05.350
What, that she go back
to school?

03:05.352 --> 03:06.785
I know.

03:06.787 --> 03:08.020
At least a couple
night classes, right?

03:08.022 --> 03:10.255
Get around
some people.

03:10.257 --> 03:13.192
She's a lost cause.
Let's move on.

03:13.194 --> 03:15.427
I'm talking about us
doing deliveries.

03:15.429 --> 03:17.095
Why do we never deliver?

03:17.097 --> 03:19.798
Speak for yourself.
I've delivered.

03:22.835 --> 03:25.437
Seriously, Max, those
delivery services--

03:25.439 --> 03:27.873
eat24, grubhub--
do big business.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.541
No one wants
to go out now.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.876
People are so lazy.

03:30.878 --> 03:33.712
I don't really feel
like it.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.681
Seriously, Max,
all we have to do

03:35.683 --> 03:37.382
is slap a delivery charge
on that product,

03:37.384 --> 03:40.652
and suddenly, a $5 cupcake
is bringing in more money.

03:40.654 --> 03:42.621
And do you know what
more money means?

03:42.623 --> 03:45.490
No.
How would I know that?

03:48.528 --> 03:50.028
Okay, question:

03:50.030 --> 03:53.966
Which of these goes
better with no pants?

03:53.968 --> 03:57.035
I don't know.
They're both timeless...

03:57.037 --> 04:00.639
As in, there's no time
you should wear those.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.274
You can't be objective.

04:02.276 --> 04:03.609
You're like a kid
in a candy store.

04:03.611 --> 04:05.410
I'll ask Max.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.482
Uh, well, the red one
kind of matches your rash.

04:10.484 --> 04:13.285
I think we have a winner.

04:13.287 --> 04:16.288
So why are you trying out
the fancy mesh tonight?

04:16.290 --> 04:18.790
Well, even though Sophie and I
are getting back together,

04:18.792 --> 04:21.660
we wanted to make it special
and hold off on the sexual part

04:21.662 --> 04:23.395
of the relationship
until tonight.

04:23.397 --> 04:25.297
That is so sweet.
- I know.

04:25.299 --> 04:28.500
I haven't even masturbated since
right before I came in here.

04:32.839 --> 04:35.007
So, Chestnut, I was buying
some rolling papers

04:35.009 --> 04:36.642
at the bodega,

04:36.644 --> 04:40.479
and I hope this is cool,
but I said they were for you.

04:40.481 --> 04:43.949
Max, I have good news
and bad news.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.584
The bad news is,

04:45.586 --> 04:48.086
this is the only good news
I've had in three years.

04:48.088 --> 04:50.355
And the good news is...

04:50.357 --> 04:52.324
You found yourself
a new apartment?

04:53.660 --> 04:54.960
don't toy with me, woman.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.194
Speak plainly and clearly.

04:56.196 --> 04:59.064
Did you find a new apartment?

04:59.066 --> 05:01.533
Close your eyes.
I'll give you a hint.

05:01.535 --> 05:03.402
Last time I was told
to close my eyes,

05:03.404 --> 05:07.039
I woke up in a bikini
on a garbage barge.

05:07.041 --> 05:10.342
P.S., closest I ever got
to a vacation.

05:12.245 --> 05:14.046
[Horn honking]

05:14.048 --> 05:17.883
Oh, you're dating a clown?

05:17.885 --> 05:20.352
Please, you know
I would have told you

05:20.354 --> 05:22.621
if I was dating someone
who had a car.

05:22.623 --> 05:26.792
Look, it's the abandoned bike
from in front of the shop.

05:26.794 --> 05:29.061
It was the bike from
the front of the shop.

05:29.063 --> 05:33.365
Now it looks like a contestant
on<i> rupaul's bike race.</i>

05:33.367 --> 05:35.033
We're gonna use it
to make deliveries.

05:35.035 --> 05:37.469
I already signed us up
for three delivery services.

05:37.471 --> 05:38.904
Still crazy smart.

05:38.906 --> 05:40.038
Waste of time.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.540
Amazon's got drones,

05:41.542 --> 05:44.710
and we've got
one gay bike.

05:44.712 --> 05:46.211
I don't want to do
deliveries.

05:46.213 --> 05:48.547
I got this.
You bake, I'll bike.

05:48.549 --> 05:52.050
And while you bike,
I'll get baked.

05:52.052 --> 05:53.719
I'm just gonna knock out
these three "delivs,"

05:53.721 --> 05:55.320
and I'll met you
at the cupcake shop.

05:55.322 --> 05:57.122
"Delivs"?
You like "delivs"?

05:57.124 --> 05:58.790
It's an "abbreve"
I made up for "deliveries."

05:58.792 --> 06:00.392
You like "abbreve"?

06:00.394 --> 06:02.627
It's an "ab" I made up
for "abbreviation."

06:02.629 --> 06:06.531
I'm gonna make this short.
Get out.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.200
Hey, everybody.

06:09.736 --> 06:11.236

do you think?

06:11.238 --> 06:13.372
Aw, good for you,
Caroline.

06:13.374 --> 06:15.507
I've been saying that
you should hop on something

06:15.509 --> 06:19.344
pink and ride it
since I met you.

06:19.346 --> 06:23.582
[Horn honking]

06:23.584 --> 06:26.585
Ah, Max, I'm so glad
you're alone,

06:26.587 --> 06:29.421
'cause I need some girl talk.

06:29.423 --> 06:31.256
Okay, but the last time
I did girl talk,

06:31.258 --> 06:32.924
I got $3
for the first minute

06:32.926 --> 06:35.894
and $1 for each
additional minute.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.063
No, it's about Oleg.

06:38.065 --> 06:41.099
Last night,
he was unable to...

06:41.101 --> 06:43.935
Oh, what's a nice way
to say this?

06:43.937 --> 06:48.106
He couldn't get his soldier
to stand at attention,

06:48.108 --> 06:51.843
and his penis
wouldn't work either.

06:51.845 --> 06:54.045
Well, uh,
have you tried buying

06:54.047 --> 06:56.615
a<i> Cosmopolitan</i> magazine
or something?

06:56.617 --> 06:58.617
They usually have advice
on sex stuff

06:58.619 --> 07:00.619
and how to hate your body.

07:00.621 --> 07:03.021
Max...

07:03.023 --> 07:06.658
You don't think it
could be me, do you?

07:06.660 --> 07:09.161
No way, Sophie.
You are hot.

07:09.163 --> 07:10.262
Ah.

07:10.264 --> 07:11.463
The first time
Oleg saw you,

07:11.465 --> 07:13.265
his soldier
not only saluted.

07:13.267 --> 07:16.101
It exploded.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.602
You're right.
I am hot.

07:17.604 --> 07:20.338
It's all him.

07:20.340 --> 07:22.774
Remember when I said you didn't
have to do deliveries?

07:22.776 --> 07:23.942
You're gonna have to do
deliveries,

07:23.944 --> 07:25.210
'cause I only went two blocks,

07:25.212 --> 07:26.511
and I'm sweating
like shia lebeouf

07:26.513 --> 07:29.648
at a dui checkpoint.

07:33.953 --> 07:35.320
Okay, you deliver.
I'll open the window.

07:35.322 --> 07:37.722
But first,
business affirmation.

07:37.724 --> 07:41.893
Please, god, don't let us
get pistol-whipped in here.

07:46.966 --> 07:51.069
It's either that Guinevere
or spider-man came out.

07:53.706 --> 07:56.374
Caroline, can I talk to you
about a private matter,

07:56.376 --> 07:59.077
by which I mean
the matter is my privates.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.112
Okay, but hurry, Oleg.

08:01.114 --> 08:02.948
I'm in the middle
of a dream catcher situation,

08:02.950 --> 08:05.217
and it's a nightmare.

08:05.219 --> 08:06.551
And why me?

08:06.553 --> 08:08.587
'Cause I trust
and respect you

08:08.589 --> 08:12.057
and I feel like you know
your way around a limp penis.

08:14.393 --> 08:16.394
Maybe.

08:16.396 --> 08:19.097
I talked to my therapist--

08:19.099 --> 08:22.634
Roy, you know,
down at the Starbucks.

08:22.636 --> 08:24.336
He told me it's all mental.

08:24.338 --> 08:25.971
We didn't get
much further than that.

08:25.973 --> 08:29.508
He spilled a grande mochaccino
on his sandals.

08:29.510 --> 08:31.610
You're probably just scared.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.512
Intimacy is so hard
for some guys,

08:33.514 --> 08:36.948
it's not hard for some guys.

08:36.950 --> 08:39.985
Yeah, that's
all over my head.

08:39.987 --> 08:42.420
Oh, no,
Max forgot the order slips.

08:42.422 --> 08:45.156
Oleg, I'm sure
it'll all work out.

08:45.158 --> 08:48.660
Good luck getting your penne
al dente.

08:48.662 --> 08:51.630
Again, over my head.

08:56.335 --> 08:58.036
Max, what are
you doing?

08:58.038 --> 09:00.171
What are you doing?

09:00.173 --> 09:01.773
What am I doing?

09:01.775 --> 09:03.241
Well, I think I'm
watching you shove

09:03.243 --> 09:05.544
our delivery bike into
the back of an uber car.

09:05.546 --> 09:08.380
Well, this is uber-awkward.

09:08.382 --> 09:10.782
Come on, come on.
In or out.

09:10.784 --> 09:13.785
All right, Caroline,
this is milesh, with a "k."

09:13.787 --> 09:15.587
He doesn't go to the airport,

09:15.589 --> 09:18.256
and he once drove
some of maroon 5--

09:18.258 --> 09:21.259
so maroon 3.

09:21.261 --> 09:22.694
No, stop.
Caroline.

09:22.696 --> 09:24.896
If you want me to deliver
the cupcakes,

09:24.898 --> 09:27.132
I can't use the bike,
I have to use the car.

09:27.134 --> 09:28.400
Why?

09:28.402 --> 09:31.102
Oh, my god,
are you pregnant?

09:31.104 --> 09:36.408
You ask me that every day,
and almost every day I say no.

09:36.410 --> 09:39.377
Look, I want to tell you,
but it's a secret.

09:39.379 --> 09:40.946
And you can't tell anybody.

09:40.948 --> 09:43.048
Do you seriously think
I would ever tell anyone

09:43.050 --> 09:45.383
anything about this life?

09:45.385 --> 09:47.118
Right.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.421
I don't know
how to ride a bike, okay?

09:49.423 --> 09:51.389
You don't know
how to ride a bike?

09:51.391 --> 09:54.259
Max doesn't know
how to ride a bike?

09:54.261 --> 09:56.394
Damn it, Caroline!

09:56.396 --> 09:57.729
[Laughing]

09:57.731 --> 09:59.464
Max doesn't know
how to ride a bike.

09:59.466 --> 10:00.832
Oh, happy day.

10:00.834 --> 10:02.634
I finally have
something over her.

10:02.636 --> 10:03.935
There is a god,

10:03.937 --> 10:05.804
and he's laughing
at her too.

10:07.573 --> 10:09.240
Lordy, this is harder to watch

10:09.242 --> 10:12.811
than Jim carrey in a drama.

10:12.813 --> 10:14.746
[Laughing]

10:19.619 --> 10:21.252
[Knock at door]

10:21.254 --> 10:24.589
Max, are you up?

10:24.591 --> 10:27.292
What's that smell?
Did you bring home Greek food?

10:27.294 --> 10:29.160
No, that's me.

10:29.162 --> 10:32.130
That's how you smell
after you ride a bike

10:32.132 --> 10:35.700
all over williamsburg delivering
14 orders of cupcakes,

10:35.702 --> 10:37.936
and I do not wish
to smell like this again,

10:37.938 --> 10:40.772
so you have to learn how to ride
that bike, all right?

10:40.774 --> 10:43.475
Who do you think you are
busting in here

10:43.477 --> 10:46.678
smelling like hummus
but having no hummus?

10:46.680 --> 10:48.380
What is the problem?

10:48.382 --> 10:50.148
Didn't your mother ever teach
you how to ride a bike?

10:50.150 --> 10:53.184
No, my mother was too busy
being the town bike.

10:53.186 --> 10:54.886
Well, then I'll teach you.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.421
Nope.
Never getting on a bike.

10:56.423 --> 10:57.889
It's one of my three "nevers."

10:57.891 --> 10:59.457
Yes, well,
your first "never" was,

10:59.459 --> 11:01.726
"never having
a blonde roommate."

11:01.728 --> 11:05.230
You are chipping away at me
piece by piece, lady.

11:07.133 --> 11:09.567
I'm not going anywhere until
you tell me what's going on.

11:09.569 --> 11:12.570
I'd sit on your bed, but
that's your third "never."

11:12.572 --> 11:14.139
[Sighs]

11:14.141 --> 11:16.608
When I was little, there was
this kid, Tommy doonan.

11:16.610 --> 11:19.778
Nice kid, solid hopscotcher.

11:19.780 --> 11:22.147
Used to give me his fruit
roll-up at lunch every day.

11:22.149 --> 11:24.082
Max, did he give you
these fruit roll-ups,

11:24.084 --> 11:25.150
or did you take them?

11:25.152 --> 11:26.951
don't interrupt.

11:26.953 --> 11:29.721
One day, Tommy doonan
got a new bike.

11:29.723 --> 11:32.624
He was out front
with this nice, older man

11:32.626 --> 11:34.125
who looked just like him.

11:34.127 --> 11:37.062
You mean his dad?

11:37.064 --> 11:38.963
Mm, is that
what they call them?

11:38.965 --> 11:41.766
I assumed it was a predator.

11:41.768 --> 11:44.669
So anyway,
I was making fun of him

11:44.671 --> 11:46.805
'cause he seemed happy.

11:46.807 --> 11:49.641
I thought
that was our thing.

11:49.643 --> 11:52.177
And he started showing off,
doing wheelies and stuff,

11:52.179 --> 11:53.645
to put me in my place,

11:53.647 --> 11:56.715
but then he flipped up
over the handlebars

11:56.717 --> 11:59.718
and came down hard
on his face.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.052
Sad,

12:01.054 --> 12:04.656
but not worth me
having baklava pits.

12:04.658 --> 12:06.257
Well, wait.

12:06.259 --> 12:08.226
After I stopped laughing

12:08.228 --> 12:11.896
and the man picked him up
and hugged him predator-style,

12:11.898 --> 12:16.167
I saw Tommy's teeth
had busted through his cheek.

12:16.169 --> 12:17.669
To put it plainly,

12:17.671 --> 12:21.740
his mouth was
on the outside of his face.

12:21.742 --> 12:25.076
Ew, that's like something
out of a horror movie,

12:25.078 --> 12:28.713
like<i> bike of the living dead</i>
or<i> Texas bike chain massacre</i>

12:28.715 --> 12:31.716
or--well,
that's probably enough.

12:31.718 --> 12:34.886
Every time I see a bike,
I think of his little face

12:34.888 --> 12:38.356
and his little teeth
chomping out the side of it.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.291
He had to eat apples
like this...

12:40.293 --> 12:42.861
[Babbling]

12:42.863 --> 12:45.864
Max, you are not responsible
for that.

12:45.866 --> 12:47.532
Yeah, I know,

12:47.534 --> 12:51.102
and 1 out of the 12 jurors
agreed.

12:51.104 --> 12:54.205
Thank you, number six.

12:54.207 --> 12:57.675
Anyway, it freaked me out,
so good night.

12:57.677 --> 12:59.110
No, Max.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.779
It is not going
to work that way.

13:00.781 --> 13:02.180
You're learning
how to ride a bike.

13:02.182 --> 13:04.315
I'm already
on one painful cycle.

13:04.317 --> 13:06.151
I don't want to get
on another one.

13:06.153 --> 13:08.386
Max, I have access
to tootsie rolls,

13:08.388 --> 13:11.222
and if you get on a bike,
I will give you four.

13:11.224 --> 13:12.524
What am I, a chimp?

13:12.526 --> 13:14.859
Five.
Let's go.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.734
don't look so smug,
Chestnut.

13:22.736 --> 13:25.203
You don't know
how to ride a bike either.

13:25.205 --> 13:27.338
Come on, Max,
just out here in the alley.

13:27.340 --> 13:30.475
Oh, hell no!

13:30.477 --> 13:32.811
What?
- She's been back here too.

13:32.813 --> 13:35.079
Who?
- Guine-queer.

13:35.081 --> 13:39.350
There's so much yarn-bombing,
it's like craft-ganistan.

13:39.352 --> 13:40.385
Max, let it go.

13:40.387 --> 13:42.187
Stay focused.

13:42.189 --> 13:43.221
Get on the bike.

13:43.223 --> 13:44.422
No.

13:44.424 --> 13:45.557
I don't want to eat apples

13:45.559 --> 13:47.926
out of the side
of my face.

13:47.928 --> 13:50.495
Come on.
Let me teach you.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.729
Nope.
- Want a tootsie?

13:51.731 --> 13:53.598
You know I do.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.934
I mean, you taught me
how to be poor.

13:55.936 --> 13:58.403
Eh, you're getting
really good at it.

13:58.405 --> 13:59.838
Come on.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.272
You know what they say
about riding a bike.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.474
It's like riding a bike.
See?

14:03.476 --> 14:05.643
It's fun, see?
Whee!

14:05.645 --> 14:08.446
Whee, whee, whee, whee, whee!
Whee!

14:08.448 --> 14:10.114
You got a real pretty mouth,
Caroline.

14:10.116 --> 14:12.750
Can't wait to see it
on the side of your face.

14:12.752 --> 14:14.919
At least just get
on the bike.

14:14.921 --> 14:16.588
You don't even have to go
anywhere yet.

14:16.590 --> 14:17.655
Nope.
Want a tootsie?

14:17.657 --> 14:19.090
You know I do.

14:19.092 --> 14:20.592
Go.

14:20.594 --> 14:21.926
[Groans and scoffs]

14:21.928 --> 14:23.494
What is this bar
doing here?

14:23.496 --> 14:26.664
I have no use for a bar
that can't get me drunk.

14:26.666 --> 14:28.199
Okay, walk the bike
over there

14:28.201 --> 14:30.501
and lean against the car
to get your balance.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.704
Just check and make sure
there's no one around.

14:32.706 --> 14:34.005
Why do you care?

14:34.007 --> 14:35.373
The only people out here
this late

14:35.375 --> 14:37.141
would be rapists,
murderers, and freaks...

14:37.143 --> 14:39.277
[Chuckles]
You know, your peeps.

14:41.113 --> 14:42.146
(Max)
What the--

14:42.148 --> 14:44.482
hey, girls.

14:44.484 --> 14:45.850
Sophie?

14:45.852 --> 14:47.418
What are you doing
in that car alone?

14:51.056 --> 14:53.958
Oh, a dark alley
at 3:00 A.M.?

14:53.960 --> 14:56.728
Has money gotten
that tight?

14:56.730 --> 14:59.063
Yes, but that's not
why we're out here.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.565
I'm teaching Max
how to ride a bike,

15:00.567 --> 15:02.066
and it's pretty hard.

15:02.068 --> 15:04.302
Oh, yeah, I wish
I had that problem.

15:04.304 --> 15:07.305
I'm dancing
with a rope in here.

15:07.307 --> 15:09.274
We're trying some
exotic, new locales

15:09.276 --> 15:10.909
for our lovemaking.

15:10.911 --> 15:14.212
It's exotic because
this isn't even our car.

15:14.214 --> 15:15.713
(Sophie)
Oh, uh...

15:15.715 --> 15:19.083
We better hurry before
that rabbi comes back.

15:19.085 --> 15:20.919
Maybe try barking
at it again.

15:20.921 --> 15:23.221
There was some
movement earlier.

15:23.223 --> 15:24.789
[Sophie barking]

15:24.791 --> 15:27.325
Come on, Caroline, teach me
how to ride this thing.

15:27.327 --> 15:29.894
I got to get away
from temple gross shalom

15:29.896 --> 15:31.629
as fast as possible.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.097
Okay, I'm gonna get
behind you

15:33.099 --> 15:34.565
and hold on to your seat.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.401
Not without three
long island iced teas

15:36.403 --> 15:38.770
and one, "your butt
looks good in those jeans."

15:38.772 --> 15:42.240
Tootsie?
Yeah.

15:42.242 --> 15:43.408
Max, don't look.

15:43.410 --> 15:44.742
Yarn-bombing?

15:44.744 --> 15:45.910
(Han)
Hey, Max.

15:45.912 --> 15:47.345
(Max)
Han?

15:47.347 --> 15:49.013
I'm just riding my bike
to the bike store

15:49.015 --> 15:51.149
to buy more bikes.

15:51.151 --> 15:52.617
Is that han or

15:52.619 --> 15:54.686
Lance Armstrong's
runaway testicle?

15:54.688 --> 15:56.354
Sorry, couldn't
hear you.

15:56.356 --> 15:59.390
I was too busy knowing
how to ride a bike.

15:59.392 --> 16:02.327
Damn it!
Now I got to do this.

16:02.329 --> 16:05.029
You know how quickly society
will crumble around us

16:05.031 --> 16:08.833
if han starts feeling like
he can freely tease me?

16:08.835 --> 16:10.234
You sure?
- Yep.

16:10.236 --> 16:11.836
Making fun of han

16:11.838 --> 16:13.938
is one of my two free sources
of entertainment.

16:13.940 --> 16:16.407
The other one is located
right above this bar.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.376
Okay, I'll keep
my hand on the seat,

16:18.378 --> 16:20.678
and then when you're ready,
tell me, and I'll let you go.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.714
Okay, but don't let go
until I say so.

16:24.216 --> 16:25.216
Okay, let go.

16:25.218 --> 16:26.451
Already did.

16:26.453 --> 16:28.019
I'm riding a bike?

16:28.021 --> 16:29.253
Max, look out!
Pothole!

16:31.690 --> 16:35.193
[Groaning]

16:35.195 --> 16:37.628
There goes my other free source
of entertainment.

16:37.630 --> 16:39.263
Tootsie?

16:39.265 --> 16:41.966
Yes, obviously!

16:46.939 --> 16:48.740
[Bell rings]
- Table ten. Pick up, Max.

16:51.477 --> 16:53.277
Yeah, be right there.

16:53.279 --> 16:56.347
Like, you know, in a month.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.516
Uh, Max,
how you doing?

16:58.518 --> 17:02.286
I heard about
your vag-accident.

17:02.288 --> 17:04.188
Look, if you need
to see a doctor,

17:04.190 --> 17:06.791
my cousin in Florida
is a good one,

17:06.793 --> 17:10.628
but then again, the bumpy
bus ride might kill you.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.964
No, no, it'll be fine,
Earl.

17:12.966 --> 17:15.033
I'm icing it.
I just have to keep it cold.

17:22.041 --> 17:25.176
We're out of ginger ale.

17:25.178 --> 17:28.913
I think you mean the ginger ale
is out of you.

17:30.249 --> 17:31.682
Max, let me
get that for you.

17:31.684 --> 17:33.718
I feel like it was
kind of my fault.

17:33.720 --> 17:34.719
Kind of?

17:34.721 --> 17:36.087
Was Lincoln's death

17:36.089 --> 17:37.155
kind of John wilkes booth's
fault?

17:37.157 --> 17:38.156
[Bell rings]

17:38.158 --> 17:40.058
Pick up, Caroline.

17:40.060 --> 17:41.759
How'd it go with Sophie?

17:41.761 --> 17:43.995
Were you able to do the thing,
you know, the man does

17:43.997 --> 17:47.231
while the woman makes
shopping lists in her head?

17:47.233 --> 17:48.933
Shh.
Come on.

17:48.935 --> 17:51.269
I don't want anyone to know
I can't get it up.

17:51.271 --> 17:53.638
Oleg can't
get it up?

17:53.640 --> 17:55.840
[Laughing]

17:55.842 --> 17:58.276
OMG. Oleg can't
get it up.

17:58.278 --> 17:59.844
[Laughing]

17:59.846 --> 18:01.279
Best week ever.

18:01.281 --> 18:03.081
Hey, everybody!

18:05.451 --> 18:06.784
What's up?

18:06.786 --> 18:08.119
Not your boyfriend.

18:08.121 --> 18:11.422
[Laughing]

18:11.424 --> 18:12.657
If anyone needs me,

18:12.659 --> 18:14.358
I'll be outside
riding my bike

18:14.360 --> 18:16.194
with an erection.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.498
Oh, no, no, no, no.
He didn't hear it from me.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.266
I only told two people--

18:22.268 --> 18:24.836
Max
and my manicurist, ming wa.

18:24.838 --> 18:26.971
And you don't have to worry
about her

18:26.973 --> 18:28.973
because she doesn't care
about anything

18:28.975 --> 18:32.844
except loving some guy
named long time.

18:35.314 --> 18:37.515
Sophie, baby,

18:37.517 --> 18:39.217
this is hard.

18:39.219 --> 18:41.953
Yeah, maybe we better not
try to be serious.

18:41.955 --> 18:44.455
I mean, the real truth is,

18:44.457 --> 18:47.391
I only like you
for your penis anyway.

18:47.393 --> 18:50.461
Say that again.

18:50.463 --> 18:53.030
What, that I only like you
for your penis?

18:53.032 --> 18:55.466
One more time.

18:55.468 --> 18:58.269
Well, what, that I don't have
any real feelings for you?

18:58.271 --> 19:00.104
That it's completely sexual

19:00.106 --> 19:04.108
and I only like you
for your big, stupid penis?

19:04.110 --> 19:05.710
I'm back, baby.

19:05.712 --> 19:08.546
Sophie, can I see you
in the kitchen?

19:08.548 --> 19:10.581
And we better hurry.
I'm making three-minute eggs.

19:12.317 --> 19:14.152
Cancel my eggs.

19:16.488 --> 19:19.957
I would've so left during
that whole conversation,

19:19.959 --> 19:23.761
but I'm holding a can
of Dr. pepper between my legs.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.897
What? He's a doctor.
He's seen it.

19:27.399 --> 19:29.233
Well, I think we're
pretty much even.

19:29.235 --> 19:32.103
Your legs are a little sore,
and I'll never have children.

19:32.105 --> 19:36.307
So I guess what
I'm saying is thanks.

19:36.309 --> 19:39.577
So you really don't want
to get back on the bike?

19:39.579 --> 19:41.112
You're just gonna give up?

19:41.114 --> 19:43.915
I bet even Tommy doonan
got back on the bike.

19:43.917 --> 19:45.149
Whatever happened to him?

19:45.151 --> 19:47.151
I caught up with him
on Facebook.

19:47.153 --> 19:50.254
Well, more like
really-messed-up-face-book.

19:50.256 --> 19:51.656
He's happily married.

19:51.658 --> 19:53.791
I bet right now
he's driving his car,

19:53.793 --> 19:56.194
looking straight ahead,
and smiling at his wife

19:56.196 --> 20:00.131
in the seat next to him.

20:00.133 --> 20:01.966
So that's it for deliveries?

20:01.968 --> 20:04.835
Oh, you can deliver
wherever and whenever you want,

20:04.837 --> 20:08.039
but there is no way I am ever
getting on that bike again.

20:09.541 --> 20:13.311
Max, look.
Guinevere.

20:13.313 --> 20:14.845
Oh, hell no!

20:14.847 --> 20:17.615
She yarn-bombed
our darn barn!

20:17.617 --> 20:19.884
You two should've tipped.

20:19.886 --> 20:22.553
I'm an artist.

20:22.555 --> 20:25.623
Eat my stitches, bitches.

20:25.625 --> 20:26.657
[Gasps]

20:26.659 --> 20:29.126
That was not whimsical at all.

20:29.128 --> 20:30.494
Give me the damn bike.

20:30.496 --> 20:32.530
Knit's about to hit the fan.

20:32.532 --> 20:33.664
[Can thuds]

20:37.135 --> 20:38.502
Max, you're doing it.

20:38.504 --> 20:40.638
What happened
to your fear of bikes?

20:40.640 --> 20:43.674
I guess the only thing stronger
is my hatred of that nerd!
