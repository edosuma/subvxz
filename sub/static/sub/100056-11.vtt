no one pushed

00:12.447 --> 00:15.189
an ultrasound machine
down the stairs...

00:15.232 --> 00:18.061
That was one time,
and it was an accident.

00:18.105 --> 00:21.456
So it looks like you guys
might actually get out on time.

00:21.499 --> 00:23.197
Yes! Caleb got
us an invite

00:23.240 --> 00:25.068
to go drinking with
the OB-GYN interns.

00:25.112 --> 00:27.723
You can imagine
the possibilities.

00:28.724 --> 00:31.988
Well, I'm leaving
this conversation.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.860
This is great news-- I'll be
able to make my date with Jenny.

00:34.904 --> 00:36.862
It's finally happening.Mm.

00:36.906 --> 00:38.255
What's finally happening?

00:38.299 --> 00:40.736
Yeah, Daniel, what's
finally happening tonight?

00:40.779 --> 00:44.044
Um, I'm... finally going
to a basketball game.

00:44.087 --> 00:46.089
I've never been.[gasps]

00:46.133 --> 00:47.786
Really? Oh, it's fun!

00:47.830 --> 00:50.311
You drink beer and try
to get on the jumbotron.

00:50.354 --> 00:52.139
Ooh, you should do
the floss.

00:52.182 --> 00:53.227
It's really in
right now.

00:53.270 --> 00:55.055
Yep, that's exactly
how you do that.

00:55.098 --> 00:56.230
Thank you.

00:56.273 --> 00:58.014
So, you going
with friends?

00:58.058 --> 01:00.103
Yeah, yeah, an
old college buddy.

01:00.147 --> 01:01.148
Steve.

01:01.191 --> 01:03.150
Tall. Big beard.

Carol, however big you're
picturing this beard,

01:05.500 --> 01:07.328
I promise you,
it's bigger.

01:07.371 --> 01:09.025
You know me well, Daniel.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.158
I was picturing
a small beard.

01:11.201 --> 01:12.768
DENNIS:
Hey, guys?

01:12.811 --> 01:14.596
You might want to cool it
on the evening plans.

01:14.639 --> 01:16.250
I just got a call
from the ER.

01:16.293 --> 01:17.816
Jake's on his way up.

01:17.860 --> 01:19.079
[frustrated groans]

01:19.122 --> 01:20.689
No! He always does this.

01:20.732 --> 01:23.126
Just as we start to think
we're gonna have an early night,

01:23.170 --> 01:25.824
Bad News Jake shows up
with a buzzer-beater patient

01:25.868 --> 01:28.088

for an extra two hours.[elevator bell dings]

Hey, Jake!Uh-huh.

01:32.309 --> 01:33.789
Aw.

Hey, Jake.

01:38.924 --> 01:40.230
You don't have to do that.

01:40.274 --> 01:42.058
I know no one likes me.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.843
Even my dog
looks disappointed
when I get home.

01:46.149 --> 01:48.195
Just a heads-up-- I'm
sending up a patient,

01:48.238 --> 01:50.719
24-year-old female with
sepsis due to a UTI.

01:50.762 --> 01:54.114
When you evaluate her, see if
you think she'll need the ICU.

01:54.157 --> 01:57.160
I could take her, but then I'd
have to miss my basketball game.

01:57.204 --> 01:58.466
Oh, don't do that.

01:58.509 --> 02:00.076
You haven't been.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.208
Yeah, send her up.

02:01.251 --> 02:02.731
I'll admit
the patient.JAKE: Thanks.

02:02.774 --> 02:05.255
No. Thank you, Jake,
for all your hard work.

02:05.299 --> 02:06.822
Oh, no problem.

02:06.865 --> 02:09.085
It's all I have.

02:10.304 --> 02:12.219
All right,
bye, everyone.

02:12.262 --> 02:14.134
Dr. Gilani.

02:15.222 --> 02:16.353
Okay.

Bye, Jake.

Always great to see you.

I'm glad you decided
to come in, Amanda.

02:40.551 --> 02:42.162
People don't take
UTIs seriously.

02:42.205 --> 02:44.947
But nobodycan stop talking
about gluten.

02:47.428 --> 02:49.517
I can't believe
I let it get this bad.

02:49.560 --> 02:52.302
My roommates just told me
to drink cranberry juice.

02:52.346 --> 02:54.304
Your roommates
don't sound like doctors.

02:54.348 --> 02:58.003
One of them teaches hot yoga,
and one of them's a witch.

02:58.047 --> 03:01.181
You'd think a witch would
come up with something better

03:01.224 --> 03:03.183
than cranberry juice.

03:04.227 --> 03:05.837
She's not a great witch.

03:07.274 --> 03:08.840
Well,

03:08.884 --> 03:10.886
you're stable at the moment,
but I think you would benefit

03:10.929 --> 03:12.279
from a little closer
observation,

03:12.322 --> 03:13.889
so I asked Nurse Dennis
to call up

03:13.932 --> 03:15.456
and have you transferred
to the ICU.

03:15.499 --> 03:16.500
Uh, Dr. Kenney?Mm-hmm?

03:16.544 --> 03:18.415
Can I have a minute?Sure.

03:18.459 --> 03:20.461
Bad news.

03:20.504 --> 03:22.593
I spoke to Dr. Mehta
in the ICU.

03:22.637 --> 03:24.291
She won't accept
your patient.

03:24.334 --> 03:25.857
She said they
don't have space.

03:25.901 --> 03:27.424
Well, that's weird,

03:27.468 --> 03:29.557
'cause we took one
of their patients this morning.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.820
Maybe they got
some more admits from the ER.

03:31.863 --> 03:33.604
Or maybe she's blocking.

03:33.648 --> 03:35.650
Blocking? What's blocking?

03:35.693 --> 03:37.260
Blocking is when
doctors try

03:37.304 --> 03:39.262
to keep a patient
out of their ward

03:39.306 --> 03:40.916
because they want
to avoid the work.

03:40.959 --> 03:44.136
That's a person in there,
not an extra unit of work.

03:44.180 --> 03:46.878
I don't believe that our ICU
is capable of blocking.

03:46.922 --> 03:49.272
It's in their name--
not only do they care,

03:49.316 --> 03:51.361
they care intensively.

03:52.493 --> 03:54.451
And I'm telling you,
blocking is real.

03:54.495 --> 03:55.931
Really real.

03:55.974 --> 03:57.672
Friday... at 5:00,

03:57.715 --> 04:00.283

some miscommunication.

I'm really happy
we're finally doing this.

this place

04:42.934 --> 04:45.241
is very popular
with senior doctors.

04:46.721 --> 04:47.765

How can I help you?Well, I'm Dr. Kenney.

05:11.528 --> 05:13.878
I called about a patient.
You refused to accept
the transfer.

05:13.922 --> 05:15.358
Female, 24, septic.

05:15.402 --> 05:16.925
Oh, yes, I remember.

05:16.968 --> 05:19.797
She was hypotensive
but saturating well on room air.

05:19.841 --> 05:23.148
In my opinion, she doesn't
require intensive care.Yeah, well,

05:23.192 --> 05:25.803
in my opinion, the way
she's trending concerns me.

05:25.847 --> 05:28.545
Well, she's still borderline.
Have you given her more fluids?

05:28.589 --> 05:30.808
Yes, of course. And I know
I'm just an intern...

05:30.852 --> 05:32.244
I'm sorry.

05:32.288 --> 05:33.768
You're an intern?

05:33.811 --> 05:35.944
[chuckles]:
Yeah.

05:35.987 --> 05:39.513
I know. I look a little older
than your average intern.

05:39.556 --> 05:40.731
You look decades older.

05:42.254 --> 05:44.126
Which is why I thought
you were an attending.

05:44.169 --> 05:45.693
And normally,
an intern wouldn't have

05:45.736 --> 05:48.348
the audacity to come up here
and argue with me.

05:48.391 --> 05:50.219
Well, I'll take that
as a compliment.

05:50.262 --> 05:54.005
Well, don't.Well, I already did.
Thank you.

05:54.049 --> 05:56.399
We're full. We don't have
any beds to spare.

05:56.443 --> 05:58.401
Now, why don't you get
on that elevator

05:58.445 --> 06:00.055
and hippity-hop
back down to your patient

06:00.098 --> 06:01.622
like a good little intern.

06:01.665 --> 06:03.406

Yes. Boop, boop, boop.
Off you go.

06:07.584 --> 06:09.586
What if he tells someone
he saw us on a date?

06:09.630 --> 06:11.283
Should we ask him
to keep it quiet?

Wait, how did you know
what we were gonna say?

06:25.210 --> 06:26.864
I was in my 20s once.

06:26.908 --> 06:29.040
Also, we're sitting
two feet apart,

06:29.084 --> 06:31.303

06:31.347 --> 06:34.655
Well, thanks
for being so cool.[chuckles]

06:34.698 --> 06:36.047
You'll have more privacy

06:36.091 --> 06:38.093
once my colleague
shows up.

06:39.747 --> 06:40.922
He was so nice.

06:40.965 --> 06:42.663
Should we invite him
to sit with us?

06:42.706 --> 06:44.534
At least until
his friend gets here?

06:44.578 --> 06:46.667
You're sweet. Do you
want to tell him, or me?

06:46.710 --> 06:47.929
No, you go ahead.

06:47.972 --> 06:49.321
Well, it was
your nice idea.

06:50.366 --> 06:52.586
I'd be delighted.

06:56.807 --> 06:58.374
Dr. Jacobs.

06:58.418 --> 07:01.116
Oh, no.
This feels like a thing.

07:02.813 --> 07:06.121
Dr. Jacobs,
it weighs heavily on my heart

07:06.164 --> 07:08.776
to levy an accusation
such as this.

07:08.819 --> 07:10.995
But I believe
that Dr. Mehta

07:11.039 --> 07:13.563
is putting her own workload
over the welfare of my patient.

07:13.607 --> 07:15.565
I don't know if you're familiar
with this term,

07:15.609 --> 07:17.828
but she is blocking.

07:19.221 --> 07:20.831
I know Dr. Mehta.

07:20.875 --> 07:23.181
We were in the same
intern class.

07:23.225 --> 07:25.314
And that is
a serious accusation.

07:25.357 --> 07:26.881
I doubt that it's true.

07:26.924 --> 07:29.057
But when I went to speak
with her, she...

07:29.100 --> 07:31.102
You did what?
Interns do not go over

07:31.146 --> 07:33.801
their chief resident's heads
and run around the hospital

07:33.844 --> 07:35.846
questioning other
doctors' decisions.

07:35.890 --> 07:37.848
Of course. I would
never question her.

07:37.892 --> 07:41.069
I just asked her
some questions.

07:41.112 --> 07:45.203
If Dr. Mehta refused to admit,
I'm sure she had her reasons.

07:45.247 --> 07:46.814
Well...

07:46.857 --> 07:49.381
she did say there
weren't any beds.

07:50.861 --> 07:54.517
Well, that strikes me as
a good reason, Dr. Kenney.

07:54.561 --> 07:56.214
You need to apologize
to Dr. Mehta.

07:56.258 --> 07:58.608
Okay. I have
some very nice stationery,

07:58.652 --> 07:59.914
and I will write her...

07:59.957 --> 08:01.872
In person!

08:05.659 --> 08:08.705
Hi. I'm, uh,
looking for Dr. Mehta.

08:08.749 --> 08:10.141
She just left for dinner.

08:10.185 --> 08:12.535
Would you like to
leave a message?
Yes.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.363
Tell her Dr. Kenney sends
her apologies.

08:14.406 --> 08:15.756
I'll follow up with a note.

08:15.799 --> 08:17.322
I have some
very nice stationery,

08:17.366 --> 08:18.715
but nobody seems to care.

08:20.804 --> 08:22.371
Okay.

08:23.372 --> 08:25.374
Is that a spare bed?

08:26.767 --> 08:29.030
There are two free beds in here.

08:29.073 --> 08:31.380
What is this, a mattress store?

08:32.599 --> 08:34.165
The ICU isn't full!

08:34.209 --> 08:36.167
No. We have lots of beds.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.953
Okay, then.

08:38.996 --> 08:41.956
Well, I'd like to make a little
amendment to my message.

08:41.999 --> 08:45.220
No message. Tell her
I apologize for nothing!

Who are you?

08:55.491 --> 08:58.189
Well, the rumors are true.
There are beds everywhere.

No one doc-blocks Carol.

Oh.

09:04.369 --> 09:07.285
Ooh, are you gonna tell
Dr. Jacobs?

09:07.329 --> 09:09.244
I already talked to
her, and she told me

09:09.287 --> 09:11.507
I'm not supposed to
question another doctor.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.509
So what,
y-you're giving up?

09:13.553 --> 09:15.903
My hands are tied.
How can we even do our jobs

09:15.946 --> 09:17.905
when the priority isn't
the patient?

09:17.948 --> 09:20.081

of even being a doctor?

never giving up,
seeing the best in people,

09:23.650 --> 09:26.566
even when it's sort of annoying
is your whole thing.

09:27.654 --> 09:29.481
Yeah, you're always willing
to do something crazy

09:29.525 --> 09:30.613
to do what's right.

09:30.657 --> 09:32.310
I am, aren't I?

09:32.354 --> 09:35.096
And that's why you're part
of the Greatest Generation.

09:37.707 --> 09:40.318
I am not part
of the Greatest Generation.

09:40.362 --> 09:42.756
Aw, don't put yourself down.

09:43.713 --> 09:46.542
How old do you
people think I am?!

09:46.586 --> 09:50.067
Even today, Dr. Mehta thought
I was a senior attending.

09:50.111 --> 09:51.678
Wait.

09:51.721 --> 09:52.766
[gasps softly]

09:52.809 --> 09:55.464
I have an idea.

09:55.507 --> 09:57.945
Now, I wasn't sure
if the Heimlich maneuver

09:57.988 --> 09:59.903
would work on a dog,

09:59.947 --> 10:01.470
but...

10:01.513 --> 10:03.907
that meatball shot
out of Barney's mouth

10:03.951 --> 10:06.518
like a T-shirt out of a cannon!

10:06.562 --> 10:08.912
[laughter][phone vibrating]

10:09.957 --> 10:11.698
Oh. Looks like Darnton

10:11.741 --> 10:14.091
won't be able
to make it to dinner.

10:14.135 --> 10:16.485
Darnton as in
Dr. Andrew Darnton?

10:16.528 --> 10:18.356
He's my medical hero.

10:18.400 --> 10:19.575
FROST:
I didn't know you

10:19.619 --> 10:21.272
were interested
in cardiology, Dr. Kutcher.

10:21.316 --> 10:23.666
That's what I want to specialize
in after I finish my residency.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.929
Oh, well, I'm meeting Darnton
at the hospital

10:25.973 --> 10:27.539
for a cigar on the roof.

10:27.583 --> 10:29.716
He's gonna tell me
all about the surgery.

10:29.759 --> 10:32.153
It took him 18 hours,
and he sweated his way

10:32.196 --> 10:34.155
through his lucky
Yankee scrub cap.

10:35.156 --> 10:37.724
I follow him on Twitter.

10:37.767 --> 10:39.726
I'm kind of a Darnton-head.

10:39.769 --> 10:41.031
[chuckles]

10:41.075 --> 10:42.293
You should join us.

10:42.337 --> 10:43.686
Oh, my God, really?

10:43.730 --> 10:45.079
FROST:
What am I saying?

10:45.122 --> 10:47.908
I've already taken up
too much of your time.

10:47.951 --> 10:49.910
Oh. Right. Of course.
[chuckles]

10:49.953 --> 10:51.389
No, not to worry.

10:51.433 --> 10:53.565
He passes through here
every decade or so.

10:54.871 --> 10:55.829
You two have fun.

10:55.872 --> 10:57.047
Oh, and dessert's on me.

10:57.091 --> 10:58.658
Try the soufflé.

10:58.701 --> 11:00.660
It's like a kiss
from a chocolate angel.

11:00.703 --> 11:02.096
Mwah.

11:03.097 --> 11:04.620
[chuckles]:
Wow.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.143
He's on his way
to see Andrew Darnton.

11:06.187 --> 11:07.101
Can you believe it?

11:07.144 --> 11:09.059
I mean, yeah.

11:09.103 --> 11:11.105
But I didn't know
who he was to begin with,

11:11.148 --> 11:12.280
so...
[chuckles]

11:12.323 --> 11:13.890
You don't know the man
who perfected

11:13.934 --> 11:15.718
the endoscopic coronary
artery bypass

11:15.762 --> 11:18.547
and has two labradoodles
named Chamber and Valve?

11:20.244 --> 11:22.072
Again, Darnton-head.

11:22.116 --> 11:24.118
[both chuckle]

11:26.163 --> 11:28.165
Daniel, do you want
to go meet him?

11:28.209 --> 11:29.950
What?

11:29.993 --> 11:31.995
No way.
We're finally having our date.

11:32.039 --> 11:34.519
Okay.

11:34.563 --> 11:37.653
Because it kind of feels
like you maybe want to go.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.655
Come on. You heard Frost.

11:39.699 --> 11:43.572
I'll get a chance to meet him
in another decade.

11:44.878 --> 11:46.227
All I'm saying is,

11:46.270 --> 11:48.316
if you want to go to the roof,
then...

11:48.359 --> 11:49.752
you should.

11:49.796 --> 11:52.015
But what about
our date?

11:52.059 --> 11:54.714
[chuckles] We've rescheduled,
like, six times already.

11:54.757 --> 11:56.106
We can do it again.

11:56.150 --> 11:58.892
This seems like a really big
opportunity for you.

11:58.935 --> 12:00.458
You should go.

12:00.502 --> 12:03.331
Thank you so much
for understanding.

12:03.374 --> 12:04.636
You are the best.

12:09.163 --> 12:10.947
Can I help you?Yeah, um,

12:10.991 --> 12:12.035
I'll take the soufflé.

12:12.079 --> 12:14.472
And a side of two more beers.

12:17.998 --> 12:20.043
[sighs, clears throat]

12:20.087 --> 12:21.566
Hey.

12:21.610 --> 12:23.046
Yeah, you.

12:23.090 --> 12:25.179
[exhales]

12:25.222 --> 12:27.964
I have a patient that needs
to be admitted to the ICU,

12:28.008 --> 12:30.445
and there seems to be
some sort of a problem.

12:30.488 --> 12:33.491
Are you that
problem, Meghan?

12:35.015 --> 12:36.712
I'm sorry, is
it "Mee-ghan"?

12:36.756 --> 12:38.888
Yes. Meghan.

12:38.932 --> 12:40.542
It's a lovely name.
[chuckles softly]

12:40.585 --> 12:43.110
But I'm a senior attending, so
I'll say it whatever way I want.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.592
This patient needs to be
admitted immediately.

12:47.636 --> 12:50.117
Oh. Dr. Mehta is gone
for the night.

12:50.160 --> 12:51.161
I could page her.

12:51.205 --> 12:52.597
Dr. Mehta?

12:52.641 --> 12:55.600
I outrank Mehta by
a mile and a half.

12:55.644 --> 12:57.167
This patient's
life is at risk.

12:57.211 --> 13:00.649
So I'm not asking for your
permission or for Dr. Mehta's.

13:00.692 --> 13:02.869
And you said
you're an attending?

13:02.912 --> 13:03.870
I did.

13:03.913 --> 13:06.829
Because I am.

13:06.873 --> 13:08.352
Can I see your I.D.?

13:08.396 --> 13:10.790
It's just,
I don't recognize you.

13:10.833 --> 13:12.313
I don't have time
to show you my I.D.

13:12.356 --> 13:13.793
I have a patient
who needs help.

13:13.836 --> 13:15.707
Dr. Kenney, is
there a problem?

13:15.751 --> 13:18.493
Actually,
if you can believe it,

13:18.536 --> 13:22.976
this intern is questioning
the fact that I'm an attending.

13:23.019 --> 13:24.412
Huh.

13:24.455 --> 13:27.502
Well, you're one of the
most respected attendings

13:27.545 --> 13:29.286
in the wholehospital.

13:29.330 --> 13:32.376
What does she think, you're
some sort of 60-year-old intern?

13:33.900 --> 13:35.510
Early to mid-50s,

13:35.553 --> 13:38.600
but, yeah, ridiculous.

13:38.643 --> 13:40.689
I'm so sorry.
I'll go initiate the order.

13:41.951 --> 13:43.823
[whispers]:
Thank you so much.

13:43.866 --> 13:45.520
Please.

13:45.563 --> 13:47.217
This ICU's Block City.

13:47.261 --> 13:48.784
It's nice to have someone
who always tries to do

13:48.828 --> 13:50.133
the right thing
for her patient.

13:50.177 --> 13:52.832
Besides, you're
always nice to me.

13:52.875 --> 13:55.269
Aw, Jake,
that means a lot.

13:55.312 --> 13:56.487
You're my best
friend, Carol.

13:58.489 --> 13:59.926
Well, I owe you one.

13:59.969 --> 14:01.362
Really?

14:01.405 --> 14:03.190
Not to cash in the
favor immediately,

14:03.233 --> 14:06.628
but any chance you could put in
a word for me with Dr. Gilani?

14:06.671 --> 14:08.935
Like, romantically?

14:10.371 --> 14:13.069
Oh, Jake.

14:13.113 --> 14:16.420
You don't make things easy
for yourself, do you?

14:17.726 --> 14:20.076
And that's when
the anesthesiologist turns to me

14:20.120 --> 14:22.774
and says, "Darnton,
that's not a mitral valve!"

14:22.818 --> 14:26.343
[laughter]

14:26.387 --> 14:28.519
Long story short,
don't operate in Moscow.

14:28.563 --> 14:31.131
No.[laughter]

14:31.174 --> 14:33.046
It's an incredible story, sir.

14:33.089 --> 14:34.134
Oh, you'll have 'em
someday, too.

14:34.177 --> 14:35.048
Mm.If you're up here with Frost,

14:35.091 --> 14:36.266
you have what it takes.Mm.

14:36.310 --> 14:38.051
That means a lot
coming from you.

14:38.094 --> 14:40.880
I'm actually a little surprised
to see you up here, Dr. Kutcher.

14:40.923 --> 14:43.578
Looked like you were having a
very nice time with Ms. Kenney.

14:43.621 --> 14:45.319
I was.
But she totally got

14:45.362 --> 14:47.321
that joining you was
a real opportunity for me.

14:47.364 --> 14:48.975
She was very cool about it.

14:49.018 --> 14:50.063
It's all good.

14:50.106 --> 14:53.370
[both laughing]

14:55.329 --> 14:56.983
What did she say
when you dropped her off?

14:57.026 --> 14:58.288
Uh, I, um...

14:58.332 --> 15:01.422
[stammers]
I left her at the restaurant.

15:03.990 --> 15:05.426
You said to try the soufflé.

15:05.469 --> 15:07.819
Try it, not eat
it by herself

15:07.863 --> 15:11.258
like a sad accountant on
her first trip to Europe.

15:13.521 --> 15:15.262
How long have you two
been together?

15:15.305 --> 15:16.785
It was a first date.

15:16.828 --> 15:18.265
Yeah, we've been trying
for a while,

15:18.308 --> 15:21.442
but we keep postponing
because of my work schedule.

15:21.485 --> 15:23.574
I shouldn't have come here,
should I?

15:23.618 --> 15:26.186
Well, that depends
on what you want.

15:26.229 --> 15:27.796
You can prioritize
your career,

15:27.839 --> 15:29.972
but you can't expect
someone else to stick around

15:30.016 --> 15:32.975
if they're
always coming in second.

15:33.019 --> 15:36.587
Take it from two men who have
been divorced three times.

15:36.631 --> 15:39.416
But i-it's possible
to have both, right?

15:39.460 --> 15:41.288
[both laughing]

15:41.331 --> 15:42.854
Well, I think so,

15:42.898 --> 15:44.987
but I haven't
managed it yet.

15:45.031 --> 15:47.163
I think I should go.

15:50.471 --> 15:53.082
Were we ever that young?

15:53.126 --> 15:55.084
Hey. You got my text.

15:55.128 --> 15:56.303
Thank you for waiting.

15:56.346 --> 15:57.782
Oh, don't thank me.

15:57.826 --> 15:59.697
Thank the soufflé that took
30 minutes to come out.

15:59.741 --> 16:01.830
I am so sorry.

16:01.873 --> 16:04.093
I shouldn't have left.
But I'm back.

16:04.137 --> 16:06.095
Can we finish our night?

16:06.139 --> 16:07.357
Daniel,

16:07.401 --> 16:09.359
it is finished.

16:09.403 --> 16:13.276
Look, Jenny, I-I
know I messed up.

16:13.320 --> 16:14.799
No. No, you didn't.

16:14.843 --> 16:16.279
Your career
is important to you,

16:16.323 --> 16:17.585
and it should be.

16:17.628 --> 16:19.021
You're just starting out.

16:19.065 --> 16:20.501
That's why I told you to go.

16:20.544 --> 16:23.025
But I don't want to just
be all about my career.

16:23.069 --> 16:25.332
Okay, but... you're
gonna have to keep making

16:25.375 --> 16:28.161
that choice over and over,
and, honestly,

16:28.204 --> 16:30.380
I don't want
that pressure on me.

16:30.424 --> 16:32.687
So that's it?

16:33.862 --> 16:36.517
Maybe now just isn't our time.

16:36.560 --> 16:38.736
I don't want to spend my Friday
nights eating a soufflé

16:38.780 --> 16:40.738
and two beers by myself.

16:40.782 --> 16:42.740
[sighs] I mean,
I do, but, like,

16:42.784 --> 16:45.874
at home, on the couch,
like a normal person.

16:55.927 --> 16:58.278
Can I, uh, get
you another beer?

16:58.321 --> 16:59.453
Oh, no.

16:59.496 --> 17:02.021
It's tequila time.

17:03.631 --> 17:05.459
Amanda's
in the ICU now.

17:05.502 --> 17:07.026
Safest place for her.

17:07.069 --> 17:08.940
And justice
is restored.

17:09.985 --> 17:11.334
[laughs]Whoo!

17:11.378 --> 17:14.468
Someone get this
lady a jumbotron!

17:16.600 --> 17:18.167
Ooh, boy.

17:19.212 --> 17:20.343
Let's hide.

17:20.387 --> 17:21.997
Let's watch.

17:22.041 --> 17:25.348
I hope you know where to buy
a bunch of tiny water bottles,

17:25.392 --> 17:27.568
'cause you'll be driving an Uber
by the end of the day.

17:28.612 --> 17:30.527
Well, I would be
a great driver,

17:30.571 --> 17:32.529
because I would take
every passenger.

17:32.573 --> 17:35.358
You'd be blocking every request
and driving around by yourself,

17:35.402 --> 17:37.230
listening to music
and vaping.

17:38.622 --> 17:40.494
MAYA:
Dr. Mehta.

17:40.537 --> 17:42.496
What brings you
down here?

17:42.539 --> 17:45.499
Your intern impersonated
a senior attending

17:45.542 --> 17:48.458
to trick one of my doctors into
accepting a borderline patient.

17:48.502 --> 17:50.286
Dr. Kenney, is this true?

17:50.330 --> 17:51.548
Yes. A-And it worked.

17:51.592 --> 17:54.029
Amanda's in the ICU,
where she belongs.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.552
She's in the ICU?

17:55.596 --> 17:57.815
But I thought the ICU
didn't have any beds.

17:57.859 --> 17:59.121
That's not the point.

17:59.165 --> 18:00.514
I'm gonna run this issue

18:00.557 --> 18:02.298
up the hospital chain
of command and make sure

18:02.342 --> 18:04.518
that Dr. Kenney is
severely reprimanded.

18:04.561 --> 18:08.609
You could, but then I would
have to inform everyone

18:08.652 --> 18:10.350
that you blocked.

18:12.308 --> 18:15.355
Oh, my God,
she's on Carol's side.

18:17.357 --> 18:21.448
Dr. Mehta, my intern
may have skirted the rules,

18:21.491 --> 18:24.015
but she did so
with the best of intentions.

18:24.059 --> 18:26.061
Can you say the same thing?

18:26.105 --> 18:27.584
Oh, boy. Here we go.

18:27.628 --> 18:29.282
St. Maya.

18:29.325 --> 18:30.674
Oh, boy. Here we go.

18:30.718 --> 18:32.720
Half-Assed Hanita.

18:33.764 --> 18:36.289
[scoffs]
Excuse me?

18:36.332 --> 18:39.292
You were a half-ass intern,
a half-ass med student

18:39.335 --> 18:42.904
and a less than half-ass
study group member.

18:42.947 --> 18:45.689
And she's rude.
Tell her she's rude.

18:45.733 --> 18:48.431
I was giving you
the benefit of the doubt

18:48.475 --> 18:50.433
as a professional courtesy.

18:50.477 --> 18:51.608
Clearly, that was a mistake.

18:51.652 --> 18:53.480
I should have listened
to my intern.

18:53.523 --> 18:56.047
Now, this is myfloor.

18:56.091 --> 18:58.180
Would you mind
returning to yours?

19:01.140 --> 19:03.533
Boop, boop, boop!

19:05.666 --> 19:07.711
That was incredible.

19:07.755 --> 19:09.800
Oh, thank you for
having my back.

19:09.844 --> 19:14.588
Dr. Kenney, some people think
the ends justify the means...

19:14.631 --> 19:17.112
There's my girl! Same page!

19:18.853 --> 19:20.507
No. No.

19:20.550 --> 19:22.509
Different pages,
different books.

19:22.552 --> 19:23.597
[chuckles]

19:23.640 --> 19:26.165
You're a doctor,
not a vigilante.

19:26.208 --> 19:28.602
Impersonating an attending
is a serious offense

19:28.645 --> 19:30.952
with serious consequences.

19:30.995 --> 19:33.215
Um, I don't know
what they are,

19:33.259 --> 19:35.174
because this
has never happened before.

19:35.217 --> 19:37.872
[chuckles]
So, for now,

19:37.915 --> 19:39.787
I'll leave you
with a stern warning

19:39.830 --> 19:42.050
to stay in your lane.

19:42.093 --> 19:43.704
But...

19:44.835 --> 19:47.708
...never stop advocating
for your patients.

19:53.583 --> 19:56.412
You were right. Amanda
crashed in the ICU,

19:56.456 --> 19:57.674
but, because
she was there,

19:57.718 --> 19:59.763
they were able to
treat her successfully.

19:59.807 --> 20:01.591
She's gotten
so much better,

20:01.635 --> 20:03.506
they're going to transfer
her back to us today.

20:03.550 --> 20:05.508
Oh, that is great news
about Amanda.

20:05.552 --> 20:07.467
And about me
being right.[elevator bell dings]

20:09.947 --> 20:11.471
Oh!

20:11.514 --> 20:14.735
Dr. Mehta, you don't usually
bring patients down yourself.

20:14.778 --> 20:16.432
No, I don't.

20:16.476 --> 20:18.739
But Amanda had something
she wanted to say.

20:18.782 --> 20:22.221
Dr. Kenney, I can't
thank you enough.

20:23.309 --> 20:27.008
For sending me
to Dr. Mehta.

20:31.317 --> 20:33.014
She saved my life.

20:33.057 --> 20:34.885
Oh. Amanda!

20:34.929 --> 20:37.279
[exhales] I told her
to leave me out of it.

20:37.323 --> 20:39.325
Just doing my job.

20:40.369 --> 20:42.937
Bye, ladies.

20:46.941 --> 20:48.986
She's the worst.

20:49.030 --> 20:51.032
Her boyfriend tried
to kiss me once.[gasps]

20:51.075 --> 20:52.555
Really?

20:52.599 --> 20:54.601
You didn't hear it from me.

20:56.342 --> 20:58.692
You can't leave me on that!
