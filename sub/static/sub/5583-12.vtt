WEBVTT

00:02.603 --> 00:03.571
Previously on Empire...
Rhonda's fine.

00:03.604 --> 00:05.139
but the baby didn't make it.

00:05.173 --> 00:07.475
RHONDA:
God doesn't exist.
If He did,

00:07.508 --> 00:09.577
the baby would still be here.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.379
Dwight Walker,
that's my real name.

00:11.412 --> 00:13.147
If you win
an ASA against your father,

00:13.181 --> 00:15.483
you're on your way
to being legendary.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.885
JAMIESON: Jamal's got a
girlfriend and all.
LUCIOUS: He didn't tell you?

00:17.918 --> 00:20.321
I'm still gay.
Well, then what are you
screwing Skye for?

00:20.354 --> 00:21.589
As the new chairman
of this board,

00:21.622 --> 00:23.157
I am turning over my proxy

00:23.191 --> 00:24.092
to my wife,
while I'm undergoing

00:24.125 --> 00:25.559
chemo and radiation.

00:25.593 --> 00:28.196
What would you say
if I made you CEO of Empire?

00:28.229 --> 00:29.263
But you need to get rid
of your little

00:29.297 --> 00:31.065
Mexican girlfriend first.

00:31.099 --> 00:33.167
I told you, I think
I'm in love with her.
I love you.

00:33.201 --> 00:36.904
I will stop at nothing
to take my company back.

00:36.937 --> 00:38.572
I ain't got to do
what you want.

00:38.606 --> 00:39.673
Cookie has her own
company under Empire

00:39.707 --> 00:40.941
And that's ridiculous.

00:40.974 --> 00:42.410
I want to be head of A&R,
for all of Empire.

00:42.443 --> 00:44.345
Ma, you got yourself a deal.

00:44.378 --> 00:47.215
I'm going to take Camilla
out from the inside.

00:47.248 --> 00:48.116
You got 48 hours.

00:51.119 --> 00:52.353
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:52.386 --> 00:55.223
Empire's new CEO,
Hakeem Lyon.

00:55.256 --> 00:56.224
(applause)

00:56.257 --> 00:58.092
What's up, y'all?

00:58.126 --> 01:00.094
Let me just say,
before we start this meeting,

01:00.128 --> 01:01.729
that I'm very excited to be

01:01.762 --> 01:04.798
the new Chief Executive Officer
of Empire Enterprises.

01:04.832 --> 01:06.134
Thank y'all for coming.

01:06.167 --> 01:08.536
This company was kicked off
by my parents,

01:08.569 --> 01:09.770
and we will keep it
in my family bloodline.

01:09.803 --> 01:12.106
Starting with my mother,
Cookie Lyon,

01:12.140 --> 01:13.774
she will be leading
with her creative direction,

01:13.807 --> 01:16.810
as our new head of A&R
for all of Empire,

01:16.844 --> 01:19.213
and our sub-label,
Lyon Dynasty.

01:19.247 --> 01:21.081
My brother Andre's been doing
a great job

01:21.115 --> 01:22.583
as Chief Financial Officer,

01:22.616 --> 01:24.718
making sure we don't go broke.
(reporters chuckling)

01:24.752 --> 01:26.887
You know, I'm going to keep him
in that position.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.055
And he's going to continue to be

01:28.088 --> 01:30.824
the President
of Gutter Life Records.

01:30.858 --> 01:32.793
And the big news is that
my brother Jamal's

01:32.826 --> 01:34.395
going to step aside
as vice-chairman,

01:34.428 --> 01:37.097
and he's going to focus on his
Black and White album,

01:37.131 --> 01:39.933
and focus on his seven
ASA nominations.

01:39.967 --> 01:41.769
Congratulations, bro.

01:41.802 --> 01:44.438
So, we have some time
for some questions.

01:44.472 --> 01:46.607
REPORTER: Hakeem...
plan to take the company

01:46.640 --> 01:47.941
in a new direction?

01:47.975 --> 01:50.978
Well, I plan to continue
on keeping the company

01:51.011 --> 01:52.913
as the dominant,
most relevant,

01:52.946 --> 01:54.448
most innovative music company

01:54.482 --> 01:56.116
on the face of the planet.

01:56.150 --> 01:57.418
You.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.687
Excuse me,
you never mentioned Lucious.

01:59.720 --> 02:00.421
Who's Lucious?

02:00.454 --> 02:02.256
Um, Lucious is focusing

02:02.290 --> 02:03.591
on his music right now.

02:03.624 --> 02:04.925
In addition to producing

02:04.958 --> 02:07.094
his half of
Jamal's Black and White album,

02:07.127 --> 02:09.297
he's also prepping a video
for his number one hit,

02:09.330 --> 02:10.931
"Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom."

02:10.964 --> 02:13.534
Hakeem, will Empire be
underwriting this video?

02:13.567 --> 02:14.802
Considering everything
that's happened between

02:14.835 --> 02:16.036
you and your father.

02:16.069 --> 02:17.771
Did you just hear what she said?

02:17.805 --> 02:20.308
"Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom"
has been nominated for a ASA.

02:20.341 --> 02:23.110
Okay, now, Lucious has been
a big part of this company,

02:23.143 --> 02:25.313
and Empire will always
support Lucious Lyon.

02:25.346 --> 02:26.980
Thank y'all for coming.

02:27.014 --> 02:28.048
Yes, thank you for coming.
Thanks.

02:28.081 --> 02:29.082
Right this way,
everyone.

02:38.526 --> 02:41.061
Now, Ma, how many times
I got to tell you,

02:41.094 --> 02:42.463
that you got to back off

02:42.496 --> 02:43.897
and you got to let me
do what I need to do.

02:43.931 --> 02:46.967
Boy, you better do
what we discussed,

02:47.000 --> 02:48.302
if you want to stay alive,

02:48.336 --> 02:51.038
let alone stay on as CEO.

02:53.006 --> 02:53.774
(sighs)

02:56.944 --> 03:01.014
*

03:01.048 --> 03:05.152
So cut to Madison Square Garden,
the tournament scene.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.855
I'm talking about more than
a thousand extras.

03:07.888 --> 03:10.991
And when Richard banishes
Bolingbroke...

03:11.024 --> 03:12.860
Who's playing the role of
Bolingbroke in the video?

03:12.893 --> 03:14.094
Oh, my girl, Freda Gatz
over there.

03:14.127 --> 03:15.363
Hey, Freda.

03:15.396 --> 03:16.697
Say, "hi" to Harper Scott.

03:16.730 --> 03:19.300
She's from Q&A News.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.271
Oh, Lucious,
you are not subtle,

03:23.304 --> 03:24.672
are you?

03:24.705 --> 03:25.873
Only when I want to be.

03:28.576 --> 03:31.044
Look, what's your angle
on this article, anyway?

03:31.078 --> 03:33.547
Richard II is about
a deposed king,

03:33.581 --> 03:35.182
violently trying to
take back his throne

03:35.215 --> 03:36.684
from a weak usurper.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.852
So should we expect violence?

03:38.886 --> 03:40.220
LUCIOUS:
I mean, stylized violence.

03:40.254 --> 03:43.223
More Jon Woo we were thinking
than, than Tarantino.

03:43.257 --> 03:45.259
In real life, though.

03:45.293 --> 03:46.394
What are you prepared to do
to get your company back

03:46.427 --> 03:47.795
from your son Hakeem?

03:47.828 --> 03:49.730
I won't have to do
a damn thing, sweetheart.

03:49.763 --> 03:52.132
I predict in three months,

03:52.165 --> 03:54.034
they're going to come
crawling back to me,

03:54.067 --> 03:55.369
the same what that Apple

03:55.403 --> 03:57.538
came crawling back
to Steve Jobs, sweetie.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.072
So, Mimi Whiteman

03:59.106 --> 04:01.174
and her wife?

04:03.411 --> 04:05.546
(laughs) Look, we-we
going to get them

04:05.579 --> 04:07.815
a real nice,
uh, wedding present.

04:07.848 --> 04:09.883
You know,
a couple of dildos.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.385
The way Camilla Marks
came for you,

04:11.419 --> 04:12.886
it seemed personal.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.154
Lady, you're just trying
to find a story

04:14.187 --> 04:15.389
where there isn't one.

04:15.423 --> 04:17.658
All right, baby,
our business is done.

04:17.691 --> 04:18.926
You didn't see it
coming, did you?

04:18.959 --> 04:20.060
It's...
You heard the man.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.061
Let's go.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.896
Look, bitch,
I'm from South Philly,

04:22.930 --> 04:24.498
I see everything coming,

04:24.532 --> 04:25.766
from every direction.

04:25.799 --> 04:27.868
Leave that, sweetheart.
Let's go.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.777
* Lie, cheat, steal, fight

04:36.810 --> 04:38.278
* Just to get on
for the night *

04:38.312 --> 04:39.847
* I'll do anything
for the power *

04:39.880 --> 04:41.949
* La, la, la,
lie, cheat, steal, fight *

04:41.982 --> 04:43.417
* Just to get on for the night

04:43.451 --> 04:45.185
* I'll do anything
for the power *

04:45.218 --> 04:46.854
* I want everybody
at attention *

04:46.887 --> 04:48.789
* At attention *
* You can call me Mr. Lyon

04:48.822 --> 04:50.424
* When I visit
* When I visit *

04:50.458 --> 04:52.125
* If money is the root
to all evil *

04:52.159 --> 04:54.462
* You can see me ball,
you'll never see me fall *

04:54.495 --> 04:56.196
* 'Cause I got the...

04:56.229 --> 04:57.865
* Time of this
* Of this *

04:57.898 --> 04:59.266
* Hot damn,
it keep me focused *

04:59.299 --> 05:01.369
* Keep me focused,
keep me focused *

05:01.402 --> 05:02.970
* My mind is a weapon
* Pow *

05:03.003 --> 05:04.271
* I got to keep it loaded

05:04.304 --> 05:05.939
* Keep it loaded,
keep it loaded *

05:05.973 --> 05:08.542
* They all want to see you,
whenever you make it *

05:08.576 --> 05:11.278
* They all want to come,
when your name in the papers *

05:11.311 --> 05:13.481
* The more that you give 'em,
the more that they take it *

05:13.514 --> 05:16.116
* So you gotta remember
to cover the bases for the *

05:16.149 --> 05:17.117
* Power *

05:17.150 --> 05:18.819
* For the power

05:18.852 --> 05:19.953
* Power *

05:19.987 --> 05:21.288
* All for the power

05:21.321 --> 05:22.790
* Power *

05:22.823 --> 05:23.891
* For the power

05:23.924 --> 05:24.992
* Power *

05:25.025 --> 05:26.059
* All for the power

05:26.093 --> 05:27.795
* Power *

05:27.828 --> 05:28.829
* Of the Empire

05:28.862 --> 05:30.297
* Power *

05:30.330 --> 05:32.232
* I'll do anything,
for power *

05:32.265 --> 05:34.234
* Of the Empire

05:34.267 --> 05:36.804
* Of-of-of the Empire

05:36.837 --> 05:38.572
* If money is the root
to all evil *

05:38.606 --> 05:39.740
* You can see me bow

05:39.773 --> 05:40.808
* People never see me fall

05:40.841 --> 05:42.910
* 'Cause I got the power.

05:42.943 --> 05:46.980
(cheering, applause)

05:47.014 --> 05:50.250
Look, y'all, it's the dawn of
a new empire here at Empire,

05:50.283 --> 05:52.853
and I'm so psyched
to have Empire's employees

05:52.886 --> 05:55.689
from day one in the building--
make some noise.

05:55.723 --> 05:57.491
(applause, cheering)
I want y'all
to check out something.

05:57.525 --> 05:58.592
This our new logo.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.431
(cheering)

06:10.404 --> 06:12.640
*

06:16.710 --> 06:18.446
Hakeem did surprisingly well

06:18.479 --> 06:19.713
at his little
press conference, didn't he?

06:19.747 --> 06:22.550
Wow, I mean,
it's just insane.

06:22.583 --> 06:25.853
There's no way that he can run
a company as big as Empire.

06:25.886 --> 06:29.222
Reverend Pryce says
God has a plan for me.

06:29.256 --> 06:31.191
I need to pay attention
because... (clears throat)

06:31.224 --> 06:33.761
he might want me to lead Empire,

06:33.794 --> 06:34.895
or he might have
something else in mind,

06:34.928 --> 06:36.229
I don't know.

06:36.263 --> 06:37.731
I need to tell you something,

06:37.765 --> 06:39.266
and, and I know you
don't believe in this stuff,

06:39.299 --> 06:41.368
but I, I hope that you
won't dismiss it out of hand.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.603
What?

06:44.905 --> 06:46.940
Baby...

06:46.974 --> 06:48.576
I had a vision.

06:48.609 --> 06:49.577
Oh...

06:49.610 --> 06:52.045
What was your vision, babe?

06:52.079 --> 06:54.748
Your fall down the stairs,
it wasn't an accident.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.950
(sighs): Oh...
Honey, you didn't just fall.

06:56.984 --> 06:58.752
Andre, please,
don't do this, really.

06:58.786 --> 07:00.153
I'm not doing anything, God is.

07:00.187 --> 07:03.791
He's leading me, so I
won't let this go.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.959
He wants us to find out
what or who...
Who?

07:05.993 --> 07:07.828
Who caused you
to lose our child.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.464
You're acting paranoid
right now,

07:10.498 --> 07:12.132
and that's a sign of a break.

07:12.165 --> 07:13.300
I promise you I'm
taking care of myself.

07:13.333 --> 07:14.802
Are you?
I am.

07:14.835 --> 07:16.970
I'm taking my medication
every single day, I am.

07:17.004 --> 07:19.473
I'm just really worried
about it, Andre, that's all.

07:19.507 --> 07:21.775
I need you
to trust me, okay?
Okay, I trust you.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.143
I need you to have faith.

07:23.176 --> 07:24.444
Okay, well,
I don't need faith.

07:24.478 --> 07:26.146
That's for sure.
Well, what do you need?

07:26.179 --> 07:29.016
I just... I think I need to
just get out of the house.

07:29.049 --> 07:30.851
Honestly, I need to
get back to work.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.119
Okay, you want to go back
to Whitney Lane?

07:32.152 --> 07:33.821
I heard that Camilla
was starting

07:33.854 --> 07:35.355
a high-end fashion department
at Empire, is that true?

07:35.388 --> 07:36.990
Yeah.

07:37.024 --> 07:39.359
"Antony and Cleopatra,"
in honor of her and Hakeem.

07:39.392 --> 07:40.928
You're kidding me.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.462
I wish I was, but...

07:42.496 --> 07:43.931
Wow.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.599
I just feel like I can't
sit around wallowing

07:45.633 --> 07:47.367
and feel sorry for myself.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.469
So do you think that you could
talk to Hakeem and ask him

07:49.503 --> 07:51.872
if she would get me in there?

07:51.905 --> 07:52.940
Sure, absolutely.

07:52.973 --> 07:53.941
Thank you.

07:53.974 --> 07:54.942
If...

07:54.975 --> 07:56.143
Oh, God.

07:57.144 --> 08:00.313
If... you do something for me.

08:00.347 --> 08:01.448
What?

08:01.481 --> 08:03.150
Come to church with me.

08:03.183 --> 08:07.621
See Reverend Pryce
for grief counseling.

08:07.655 --> 08:09.790
I know it'll help
you heal, Rhonda.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.024
It'll help heal us.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.695
Will you come?

08:14.728 --> 08:16.029
THIRSTY: Uh, let's make sure
the neighborhood knows

08:16.063 --> 08:17.197
that we're coming
to shoot a video.

08:17.230 --> 08:18.566
Keep it clean.
You got it.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.133
Ms. Lyon,

08:20.167 --> 08:21.569
Lucious is interviewing
the video directors,

08:21.602 --> 08:22.736
how about I show
you around?

08:22.770 --> 08:24.037
Uh, you don't need
to show me around.

08:24.071 --> 08:25.238
This is my place, punk.

08:25.272 --> 08:26.874
Get your ass out of here.

08:26.907 --> 08:28.141
LUCIOUS: Uh, Ms. Miles,
please see him out.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.577
Thank you for your time.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.545
Why do you even...
MS. MILES: Right this way.

08:31.579 --> 08:33.146
All these new school
directors are all the same,

08:33.180 --> 08:34.848
a bunch of hacks.

08:34.882 --> 08:37.517
Remember when you and I
used to direct our own videos?

08:37.551 --> 08:38.686
Yeah, well, that
was back before

08:38.719 --> 08:40.087
we had the
generous support

08:40.120 --> 08:42.656
of the head of
Empire's A&R Department.

08:42.690 --> 08:44.257
Show me your storyboard.

08:44.291 --> 08:45.325
And you can go back

08:45.358 --> 08:46.660
to being useless.

08:46.694 --> 08:48.495
Stop wearing
your granddaddy's suits.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.163
Okay, so the good thing
(Thirsty chuckling)

08:50.197 --> 08:51.531
is old resting bitch face

08:51.565 --> 08:53.433
is busy with her
fashion company,

08:53.466 --> 08:56.503
so she seems to be staying
out of our business.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.939
Meanwhile, I'm working on our
plan to get her out of Empire.

08:58.972 --> 09:01.074
You need to get rid of this.

09:01.108 --> 09:02.409
Lose it.
You don't need it.

09:02.442 --> 09:03.510
Wait, w-wait, wait,
that's my dream sequence.

09:03.543 --> 09:04.845
Yeah, I know.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.915
It's beautiful,
but it's too much, I mean,

09:07.948 --> 09:09.783
you're hiding behind
all that fantasy.

09:09.817 --> 09:11.284
Get rid of it.
You don't need it.

09:11.318 --> 09:12.886
The song's not about hiding.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.088
Boom, boom, boom, boom,
bang, bang, bang, bang.

09:15.122 --> 09:16.790
Drop that. Trust me.

09:16.824 --> 09:18.626
That's dope.
Damn 'em.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.794
You always were good, Cookie.

09:20.828 --> 09:22.630
I know.

09:22.663 --> 09:24.264
Okay...

09:24.297 --> 09:26.266
(muttering)
let me try your ears
on something else.

09:29.169 --> 09:31.271
(dramatic piano melody
playing)

09:31.304 --> 09:32.339
Mm!

09:34.507 --> 09:37.778
Just piano.
Yeah. It's hot.

09:40.447 --> 09:41.248
Mm...

09:41.281 --> 09:43.316
(music continues)

09:46.353 --> 09:47.655
(chuckles)

09:47.688 --> 09:48.922
(remote blips,
lowers volume on music)

09:48.956 --> 09:50.423
That's fire, Lucious.

09:50.457 --> 09:54.161
I mean, I can hear
the pain, the passion...

09:54.194 --> 09:56.930
Yeah, you're doing some
pretty decent work right there.

09:56.964 --> 09:58.666
You mean that?
Maybe.

09:58.699 --> 10:00.433
(laughing)
Seriously, that's

10:00.467 --> 10:01.835
probably some of the best work

10:01.869 --> 10:04.805
you've done in a long time.

10:04.838 --> 10:07.641
Maybe that's the silver lining.

10:07.675 --> 10:10.077
Maybe Hakeem
did you a favor.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.479
I can't wait to
return the favor.

10:12.512 --> 10:14.447
(wry laugh)

10:14.481 --> 10:16.316
So how's Jamal doing?
(knocking on door)

10:16.349 --> 10:18.451
I got some bad news.

10:18.485 --> 10:19.820
And not altogether surprising,

10:19.853 --> 10:21.955
but, but, but bad nonetheless.

10:21.989 --> 10:22.956
I should've seen it coming,
I should have been ahead of it.

10:22.990 --> 10:24.825
I'm sorry, I'm, I'm very sorry.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.126
Are you okay, Andre?

10:26.159 --> 10:27.160
I'm not okay, no.

10:27.194 --> 10:28.762
I'm not okay. No.

10:28.796 --> 10:29.997
Hey, wait, wait. Wh...
what's the bad news?

10:30.030 --> 10:31.164
Camilla cut the budget
for your video.

10:31.198 --> 10:32.165
She slashed it.

10:32.199 --> 10:33.834
What?! She can't do that.

10:33.867 --> 10:34.935
Oh, yes, she can.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.336
Any outlay over $750,000

10:36.369 --> 10:38.138
is subject to board approval.

10:38.171 --> 10:39.172
She controls the board...

10:39.206 --> 10:40.273
Well, not for long.

10:40.307 --> 10:41.775
Hey! Thirsty!

10:41.809 --> 10:42.843
No, uh, uh... n...

10:42.876 --> 10:44.845
Thirsty!
Lucious! Lucious.

10:44.878 --> 10:47.314
You got to sit tight till Hakeem
gets enough dirt on Mimi,

10:47.347 --> 10:50.117
then Dre's ready to pounce.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.685
(slaps wall)

10:51.719 --> 10:53.386
(sighs)

10:55.055 --> 10:57.024
Andre?

10:57.057 --> 11:00.193
You okay, babe?

11:00.227 --> 11:01.561
Yeah.

11:03.563 --> 11:07.000
I'm a little worried you
came back to work too soon.

11:07.034 --> 11:10.037
(chuckles) You don't
got to worry, Mama.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.238
I'm good.

11:14.074 --> 11:16.043
BECKY: Look, Crazy Camilla
cannot stay in charge of Empire.

11:16.076 --> 11:16.877
I really think
that Lucious should just...

11:16.910 --> 11:18.045
JAMAL: Becky, no, trust me.

11:18.078 --> 11:19.346
Cookie put the fear
of God in Hakeem.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.014
Soon as he gets Camilla
on tape admitting

11:21.048 --> 11:23.183
that she and Mimi set
Lucious up, we gonna be fine.

11:23.216 --> 11:24.718
Jamal...!

11:24.752 --> 11:26.386
Congratulations on all
your ASA noms, Boo.

11:26.419 --> 11:27.888
Aw, thank you so much.

11:27.921 --> 11:29.556
Absolutely. Will you
please sign these?

11:29.589 --> 11:30.690
Yeah, no doubt.

11:30.724 --> 11:31.892
What is this about?

11:31.925 --> 11:33.560
See, we put you
where you are,

11:33.593 --> 11:35.228
so why did you decide to...

11:35.262 --> 11:36.730
(music intro plays)

11:36.764 --> 11:38.766
* You let the team down

11:40.067 --> 11:41.835
* She made the gays frown

11:41.869 --> 11:43.236
Come on, we should go.
Let's go. Come on.
Wait, wait...

11:43.270 --> 11:45.105
* She shamed the wrong crowd

11:46.807 --> 11:48.275
* She make that thing go

11:48.308 --> 11:50.043
* Flip, flop

11:50.077 --> 11:51.578
* Flip, flippity, flop

11:51.611 --> 11:52.946
* Flip, flop

11:52.980 --> 11:54.581
* Flip, flippity, flop

11:54.614 --> 11:56.116
* Flip, flop

11:56.149 --> 11:57.918
* Flip, flippity, flop

11:57.951 --> 11:59.252
* Flip, flop

11:59.286 --> 12:01.154
* Flip, flippity, flop!
BECKY: Come on, now!

12:03.490 --> 12:05.592
That's not even
his song, stupid.

12:09.897 --> 12:10.964
JAMAL: Let's go.

12:17.637 --> 12:19.039
Jamieson, you really
expected me to believe

12:19.072 --> 12:20.908
that you've never been caught,
I don't know, whispering,

12:20.941 --> 12:22.442
or holding hands with some d...

12:22.475 --> 12:23.911
look at the picture of you
and Chrissie Hynde.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.745
Are you saying that you
didn't hook up with Skye?

12:25.779 --> 12:28.548
I'm saying that it's
nobody's business, honestly.

12:28.581 --> 12:29.983
I'm saying that I don't see

12:30.017 --> 12:31.985
how the entire gay community
can turn against me,

12:32.019 --> 12:33.553
based on gossip and innuendo.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.722
I'm sorry, it's not gossip
and innuendo,

12:35.755 --> 12:37.090
when it's your own father

12:37.124 --> 12:39.860
who's out there bragging
about it, Jamal.

12:41.128 --> 12:42.395
My father?

12:42.429 --> 12:43.730
Lucious is the one that told me

12:43.763 --> 12:44.932
what a great thing it was

12:44.965 --> 12:47.100
that you and Skye got busy.

12:47.134 --> 12:49.336
Not just for you,
but for your career.

12:49.369 --> 12:52.272
He still thinks that
being gay is a liability.

12:54.541 --> 12:56.443
Jamieson, he did
that on purpose.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.345
Explain.

12:58.378 --> 12:59.847
My father and I are
nominated against

12:59.880 --> 13:01.248
each other for
the same category.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.816
He's never won an
ASA award before.

13:02.850 --> 13:04.684
He wants it more
than anything.

13:04.717 --> 13:07.287
Even if it means
sabotaging my chances.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.923
I still can't believe
he'd do that to me.

13:09.957 --> 13:12.192
(kissing)

13:14.561 --> 13:16.864
So how do you like being
a girlfriend of a CEO?

13:16.897 --> 13:19.132
Is that my official title?

13:19.166 --> 13:21.134
We made it official
the other night.

13:21.168 --> 13:22.602
At least that's
what I thought.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.371
Me, too.

13:25.705 --> 13:27.140
Check out the view.

13:27.174 --> 13:28.608
Hakeem, I met with your
sister-in-law today.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.810
I'm prepared to hire her,
so long as...

13:31.879 --> 13:33.346
Who's this?

13:33.380 --> 13:35.849
Laura Calleros, my singer
in Mirage á Trois,

13:35.883 --> 13:36.984
meet Camilla Marks.

13:37.017 --> 13:38.285
Marks-Whiteman.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.786
Camilla Marks-Whiteman,

13:39.819 --> 13:42.555
wife of the
Chairman of the Board of Empire.

13:42.589 --> 13:44.291
See, Laura, she's here,

13:44.324 --> 13:46.793
'cause she got a huge meeting
with A&R downstairs.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.161
And matter of fact,
you should go downstairs,

13:48.195 --> 13:49.296
so you won't be late.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.898
Nice to meet you.

13:50.931 --> 13:51.932
You got this.

13:55.102 --> 13:56.236
What's up?

13:56.269 --> 13:58.838
Didn't I tell you
to get rid of her?

13:58.872 --> 14:00.908
I can't, she's a
big part of Empire.

14:00.941 --> 14:02.842
She's pathetically
in love with you.

14:02.876 --> 14:04.811
So, you married--
what do you want from me?

14:04.844 --> 14:06.746
What am I supposed to be,
a side piece or something?

14:06.779 --> 14:09.749
It's only a matter of time
before my dear wife passes.

14:09.782 --> 14:11.851
And did I mention she's going to
leave her Empire shares to me?

14:11.885 --> 14:14.487
And I've always
imagined you and I,

14:14.521 --> 14:16.689
whether we would dismantle this
company or start a new one...

14:16.723 --> 14:17.991
Dismantle it--
are you crazy?

14:18.025 --> 14:19.526
I'm not here to do that.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.261
I'm here to prove to everybody
that I got this legit.

14:21.294 --> 14:23.230
And that it's not just
because of you.

14:23.263 --> 14:26.366
I believe you'll be a
brilliant CEO, Hakeem.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.635
Didn't I tell you that
you'll be king one day?

14:30.237 --> 14:31.238
Yeah, you told me that.

14:31.271 --> 14:34.374
Are you going to
make me happy?

14:34.407 --> 14:37.911
I want to, and I
promise I'll try.

14:37.945 --> 14:39.913
I certainly hope so,

14:39.947 --> 14:42.582
after everything
I've done for you.

14:48.956 --> 14:50.390
You need to
show her what again?

14:50.423 --> 14:51.925
Well, I have a list
of all the hotels

14:51.959 --> 14:53.093
on the tour stops,

14:53.126 --> 14:54.761
where Empire has
special rates.

14:54.794 --> 14:56.263
I think you better give me
that and let me show her.

14:56.296 --> 14:57.764
Well, I'm going
to tell her, bitch.

14:57.797 --> 15:00.267
Cookie, I got some info for you.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.102
She didn't get it, I did.

15:02.135 --> 15:03.303
That's my tablet, Cookie.

15:03.336 --> 15:04.537
Look, you know she fresh
out of rehab

15:04.571 --> 15:06.106
and her brain still
muddled all up.

15:06.139 --> 15:07.640
What is it?
You know this
entitled bitch

15:07.674 --> 15:08.808
had a nerve to get
your publicity girl

15:08.841 --> 15:10.610
to take out your
dry cleaning

15:10.643 --> 15:13.113
instead of doing it herself,
like you asked her to.

15:13.146 --> 15:14.381
First of all, who you
calling a bitch?

15:14.414 --> 15:15.782
I'm calling
you a bitch.
Hello!

15:15.815 --> 15:17.484
Hello! Hello.

15:17.517 --> 15:20.287
Hi... See all these
lovely people here?

15:20.320 --> 15:22.122
We're having
a meeting in here.

15:22.155 --> 15:24.624
Yeah, because we have jobs,
and we're trying to plan

15:24.657 --> 15:26.626
Tiana's 30-city tour.

15:26.659 --> 15:28.761
So we don't have time
to listen to you

15:28.795 --> 15:31.431
cat and claw down the hall.

15:31.464 --> 15:32.799
You need a smart
assistant.

15:32.832 --> 15:33.967
You need a
brain cell.

15:34.001 --> 15:35.102
(guffawing)

15:35.135 --> 15:37.137
What's after St. Louis?

15:37.170 --> 15:38.972
I'm so sorry.

15:39.006 --> 15:41.641
Okay, uh, we got an offer
from Lincoln Hall,

15:41.674 --> 15:43.610
Mom...
and I think that
Tiana can continue at

15:43.643 --> 15:44.777
the Chicago Theater if...

15:44.811 --> 15:46.646
It was Lucious.

15:46.679 --> 15:48.982
(sighs)
COOKIE:
Your father is a tampon,

15:49.016 --> 15:50.783
we already knew that.

15:50.817 --> 15:52.685
No, Mom, it-it's different
this time-- it's so much,

15:52.719 --> 15:55.488
it's so much deeper than,
than some stupid award.

15:55.522 --> 15:58.158
You know what I'm saying?
He's foul on a, on a
whole other level.

15:58.191 --> 15:59.626
And I'm getting him back
this time.

15:59.659 --> 16:01.361
Jamal, what you need
to be focused on

16:01.394 --> 16:03.163
is getting your fans back, okay?

16:03.196 --> 16:05.832
There are a lot of gay
ASA voters, and you need them.

16:05.865 --> 16:09.202
I don't care about the ASAs
or... I care about my music.

16:09.236 --> 16:10.837
That's what... uh... he's not
having anything to do

16:10.870 --> 16:11.838
with the Black and White album.

16:11.871 --> 16:12.839
We'll push it back...

16:12.872 --> 16:14.007
No...
You can produce it.

16:14.041 --> 16:15.842
I don't care.
No, you will not.

16:15.875 --> 16:19.179
Look, I'm meeting with the PR
team to discuss Tiana's tour.

16:19.212 --> 16:21.648
I will have them come up
with a clever way

16:21.681 --> 16:23.650
to get the gays back behind you.

16:23.683 --> 16:24.851
It shouldn't take a PR team.

16:24.884 --> 16:26.186
Just drop
your drawers, brother.

16:28.555 --> 16:30.323
This is what we do now.

16:30.357 --> 16:32.692
Andre, what do you need?

16:32.725 --> 16:33.526
I-I didn't mean it, bro.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.328
I know, man. It's fine.

16:35.362 --> 16:37.697
What is it, Andre?

16:37.730 --> 16:39.866
Camilla won't approve the
budget for Tiana's tour.

16:39.899 --> 16:41.034
She said Hakeem
hasn't provided her

16:41.068 --> 16:42.169
with the items
she requested.

16:42.202 --> 16:44.171
That bitch got to go.

16:44.204 --> 16:45.705
Mom, we're building a case.

16:45.738 --> 16:47.907
Soon as Hakeem gets us
that tape, I plan to

16:47.940 --> 16:49.909
demonstrate poor performance,
malfeasance,

16:49.942 --> 16:51.544
moral turpitude...

16:51.578 --> 16:54.381
Andre, I don't care if
your crazy ass got to

16:54.414 --> 16:57.084
build a rocket to
launch her to the moon.

16:58.751 --> 17:01.388
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.356
Andre, honest, I'm sorry--
I didn't mean to say it.

17:03.390 --> 17:04.424
It just came out.

17:04.457 --> 17:06.559
I need to do a better job

17:06.593 --> 17:07.894
of checking myself, okay?

17:07.927 --> 17:11.764
I'm so... sorry.

17:14.401 --> 17:15.902
I need to go tell Tiana.

17:15.935 --> 17:18.238
She can't hear this
from nobody else.

17:25.778 --> 17:28.648
(fast tempo intro playing)

17:37.790 --> 17:40.593
*

17:40.627 --> 17:43.596
* I just came in here to dance

17:44.931 --> 17:47.934
* I'm not looking for a man

17:48.801 --> 17:51.104
* Me and my best friend

17:51.138 --> 17:52.472
* Goin' in

17:54.507 --> 17:57.144
* Boy, you better watch
your hands *

18:00.980 --> 18:05.585
* 'Bout to get summertime,
playin' for the bad boy *

18:05.618 --> 18:09.489
* Didn't I, didn't I,
didn't I look good? *

18:09.522 --> 18:10.590
* Look at my body

18:10.623 --> 18:11.624
* Look at my body

18:11.658 --> 18:12.625
* Look at my body

18:12.659 --> 18:14.060
* Look at my body

18:14.093 --> 18:15.395
* Don't I look sexy?

18:15.428 --> 18:16.896
* Don't I look sexy?

18:16.929 --> 18:19.098
* Look, but don't touch,
don't touch *

18:19.132 --> 18:20.767
* Don't touch, don't touch

18:20.800 --> 18:22.902
* LBDT
* Look, but don't touch

18:22.935 --> 18:24.103
* Don't touch,
don't touch... *

18:24.137 --> 18:27.039
* I just came in here to dance

18:28.641 --> 18:31.711
* Me and my best friend
goin' in *

18:33.146 --> 18:36.015
* Boy, you better watch
your hands *

18:37.850 --> 18:40.720
* 'Bout to get summertime,
playin' for the bad boy *

18:42.355 --> 18:46.526
* Didn't I, didn't I,
didn't I look good? *

18:46.559 --> 18:48.995
* Look at my body,
look at my body *

18:49.028 --> 18:50.930
* Look at my body,
look at my body *

18:50.963 --> 18:51.931
* Don't I look sexy?

18:51.964 --> 18:53.266
* Don't I look sexy?

18:53.300 --> 18:54.501
* Don't I look sexy?

18:54.534 --> 18:56.803
* Don't I look sexy? Yeah.

18:56.836 --> 19:00.240
MAN: Okay, ladies, that's a cut
on rehearsal. Thank you.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.476
Thank you.

19:03.510 --> 19:04.477
You like?
I love!

19:04.511 --> 19:05.778
Thank you.

19:05.812 --> 19:06.946
Come here, let me talk
to you for a minute.

19:06.979 --> 19:11.651
Okay, um, this is
just temporary, okay?

19:11.684 --> 19:13.152
So I don't want
you to get upset,

19:13.186 --> 19:16.789
but we might have to
put your tour on hold.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.292
I'm not upset.

19:19.326 --> 19:20.360
Good.

19:20.393 --> 19:21.794
I'm out.
No, no, no.

19:21.828 --> 19:22.962
Tiana, I said temporary.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.163
It's just temporary, baby.

19:24.197 --> 19:25.565
Would it make a difference
if I started

19:25.598 --> 19:27.734
sleeping with him again?
Who? Hakeem?

19:27.767 --> 19:29.302
And please, don't tell me

19:29.336 --> 19:31.671
he's putting her on
my tour instead.

19:31.704 --> 19:34.173
Mirage á Trois couldn't even
fill up a coffee house.

19:34.207 --> 19:35.508
You are right about that.

19:35.542 --> 19:36.876
That's, that's not what
this is about.
You know what?

19:36.909 --> 19:39.178
They're barely good enough
to even open for me.

19:44.751 --> 19:45.952
That's it.

19:47.754 --> 19:50.690
I'm surprised you wanted
to come back to work so soon.

19:50.723 --> 19:52.425
Especially for her.

19:52.459 --> 19:54.527
I had to, honestly.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.663
I've been trying to
explain that to Andre,

19:56.696 --> 19:58.030
but he just
doesn't get it.

19:58.064 --> 19:59.899
He's not good, is he?

19:59.932 --> 20:02.034
He just needs to
recalibrate his meds.

20:02.068 --> 20:03.903
It's happened before,

20:03.936 --> 20:07.807
and major stress is
the worst thing for it.

20:08.941 --> 20:11.811
So...
Like losing your baby.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.882
What do you do
when he gets like that?

20:15.915 --> 20:18.685
I mean, I don't want to see
my baby in that hospital again.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.186
Neither do I.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.888
And I have tried
and tried and tried

20:21.921 --> 20:25.057
to get him to see
a doctor, but he...

20:25.091 --> 20:28.361
We are going to his pastor
for counseling, so...

20:28.395 --> 20:31.097
Well, I hope that works.

20:31.130 --> 20:33.099
Me, too.
Milla's at her

20:33.132 --> 20:35.134
drafting table,
so we probably shouldn't

20:35.167 --> 20:38.137
gab in front of her.

20:38.170 --> 20:40.940
Well, you take care
of yourself, okay?

20:40.973 --> 20:43.009
I will, I will.

20:48.014 --> 20:50.149
Wow, Camilla girl, you are

20:50.182 --> 20:52.385
really working these designs.

20:52.419 --> 20:54.654
Very chic.

20:54.687 --> 20:56.255
As if you would know.

20:57.123 --> 20:59.158
The reason I'm here,

20:59.191 --> 21:01.494
I would like to talk to you
about Tiana's tour.

21:01.528 --> 21:03.596
You know, we've been
working on this for months.

21:03.630 --> 21:06.666
Well, that's before you had to
answer to a board of directors.

21:06.699 --> 21:08.501
Right.

21:08.535 --> 21:11.070
But if artists don't tour,
they don't eat.

21:11.103 --> 21:14.106
Yes, but the board feels
that it's too expensive

21:14.140 --> 21:16.909
for a single artist,
who isn't a stadium act.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.745
Glad you brought that up.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.947
That's why I'm thinking of
sending Mirage á Trois

21:20.980 --> 21:23.950
out on a tour with her,
as the opening act.

21:25.151 --> 21:27.487
(wry chuckling)

21:27.520 --> 21:29.622
Mirage á Trois?

21:29.656 --> 21:32.091
Yes, we get two tours
for the price of one.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.993
I already got them
on a 360 deal,

21:34.026 --> 21:36.763
so we can afford to keep
them out on the road

21:36.796 --> 21:37.997
for months.

21:38.030 --> 21:43.770
Okay, so I'll push it through,

21:43.803 --> 21:47.273
and that way you'll keep her
away for a very long time.

21:47.306 --> 21:48.775
Mm-hmm.

21:48.808 --> 21:49.842
Bingo.

21:51.544 --> 21:52.612
Mom, you can't
be making decisions

21:52.645 --> 21:54.280
without consulting me first.

21:54.313 --> 21:58.017
Boy, I'm trying to protect
your stupid ass, Mr. CEO.

21:58.050 --> 22:01.521
You let that psycho-bitch in the
house in the first place.

22:01.554 --> 22:02.855
I seen a chance
and I went for it.

22:02.889 --> 22:04.156
And I think I deserve my props.

22:04.190 --> 22:05.658
You wanted Lucious out
and I got him out.

22:05.692 --> 22:07.794
You wanted Empire,
and I got Empire.

22:07.827 --> 22:10.296
I am trying to save Empire.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.298
That bitch can burn it down
any time she wants to.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.467
Do you not understand that,
Hakeem?

22:14.501 --> 22:17.804
So until you get me
what I need to get rid of her...

22:17.837 --> 22:19.338
I'm not sending you on tour,
so don't worry.

22:19.372 --> 22:21.173
It's okay, Hakeem.

22:21.207 --> 22:23.643
I actually think it's
a really great idea.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.344
Uh, don't worry about it,
I can handle Camilla.

22:25.378 --> 22:26.746
Are you not listening
to what she's saying?

22:26.779 --> 22:27.980
Laura, please tell him.

22:28.014 --> 22:30.517
It's a huge opportunity.

22:30.550 --> 22:32.351
I talked to the girls.

22:32.385 --> 22:34.987
Mirage á Trois is excited
to go on tour with Tiana.
Really?

22:35.021 --> 22:36.689
Get your stuff, hon.

22:39.091 --> 22:42.729
Hakeem,
you brought this on yourself.

22:42.762 --> 22:44.497
You're not only
going to lose Laura,

22:44.531 --> 22:46.499
but you're going to lose
your entire family

22:46.533 --> 22:48.234
if you don't fix this.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.448
So for the shoot,
you guys are going to be

23:01.481 --> 23:03.916
holding up a girl who weighs
roughly 110 pounds

23:03.950 --> 23:05.852
for maybe, I don't know,
five or ten minutes.

23:05.885 --> 23:06.886
Is that going
to be a problem?

23:07.887 --> 23:09.456
(laughing):
Oh, okay.

23:09.489 --> 23:11.023
I guess not.

23:11.057 --> 23:12.725
(whispering): I can't.
I just can't right now.

23:12.759 --> 23:15.294
Would you guys, actually,
excuse me for one second?

23:15.327 --> 23:19.065
You can go ahead and grab their
shoe sizes for me, thanks.

23:19.098 --> 23:21.468
It's not that, it's just
that I don't want you

23:21.501 --> 23:23.936
to travel if you're
not well enough.

23:23.970 --> 23:26.873
Of course, I'm excited
to see you.

23:26.906 --> 23:29.709
But I'm not. Mimi.

23:29.742 --> 23:32.879
You keep accusing me
and it's just so insulting.

23:32.912 --> 23:36.048
Okay.

23:36.082 --> 23:39.285
(sighs) I look forward
to seeing you, too.

23:39.318 --> 23:40.620
Love you.

23:43.456 --> 23:44.256
(angry shout)

23:48.461 --> 23:51.931
* I know you know we're wrong

23:51.964 --> 23:54.100
* We can make
a good thing... *

23:54.133 --> 23:56.002
Hello.
Hi.

23:56.035 --> 23:59.105
Thank you so much helping
get his people out tonight.

23:59.138 --> 24:00.673
I got played by Lucious.

24:00.707 --> 24:02.642
I should have known better.

24:02.675 --> 24:03.943
But I'll do
everything I can

24:03.976 --> 24:05.144
to help repair
the damage.

24:05.177 --> 24:06.779
Thank you.

24:06.813 --> 24:08.848
Your ex-husband
is a bastard.

24:08.881 --> 24:10.983
* ...good thing,
keep happening. *

24:11.017 --> 24:15.855
ANNOUNCER:
Please welcome multiple
ASA nominee, Jamal Lyon.

24:25.197 --> 24:26.999
JAMAL: Y'all know I ain't
never been one to put

24:27.033 --> 24:28.801
my family business out there,

24:28.835 --> 24:31.871
but even my loyalty
has its breaking point.

24:31.904 --> 24:36.042
(slow intro playing)

24:38.678 --> 24:40.179
* Ah, ah, ah

24:42.014 --> 24:44.150
* Ah, ah

24:44.183 --> 24:46.553
* Oh, oh, oh

24:48.521 --> 24:50.857
* Guess what?

24:50.890 --> 24:54.026
* People tell me I'm
just like my daddy *

24:54.060 --> 24:57.630
* People tell me
I'm just like my daddy *

24:57.664 --> 25:00.232
* People tell me I'm
just like my daddy *

25:00.266 --> 25:02.134
* My daddy

25:02.168 --> 25:05.337
* 'Cause I lie like
I'm lying on a rug *

25:05.371 --> 25:07.173
* Get my hands a little dirty

25:07.206 --> 25:09.175
* No glove

25:09.208 --> 25:11.143
* Everybody welcome
to the gun show *

25:11.177 --> 25:12.211
* Let it go

25:12.244 --> 25:13.980
(gunshots)

25:14.013 --> 25:15.782
* Everybody duck down

25:17.750 --> 25:19.151
* It's hard to love

25:19.185 --> 25:20.653
* The devil

25:20.687 --> 25:22.388
* He's a hater

25:24.423 --> 25:29.195
* A dirty hypocrite
manipulator *

25:30.630 --> 25:32.599
* Made a mama lose her kids

25:32.632 --> 25:35.201
* Let her go away for 17 years

25:37.770 --> 25:39.338
* Not allowed to shed a tear

25:39.371 --> 25:42.108
* Growing up
with all your phobic fears *

25:42.141 --> 25:47.013
* But people tell me
I'm just like my daddy *

25:47.046 --> 25:50.416
* People tell me I'm just
like my daddy *

25:50.449 --> 25:53.052
* People tell me
I'm just like my daddy *

25:53.085 --> 25:54.621
* Oh, really? Hell, no

25:54.654 --> 25:58.024
* 'Cause I lie like I'm
lying on a rug *

25:58.057 --> 26:01.360
* Did some crime,
even wore some black gloves *

26:01.393 --> 26:04.463
* Everybody welcome
to the gun show *

26:04.496 --> 26:06.065
* And we go Daddy?

26:06.098 --> 26:07.133
(gunshot)

26:07.166 --> 26:08.601
* Everybody duck down

26:10.737 --> 26:13.539
* You reek of royalty

26:13.572 --> 26:15.107
* A dangerous mix

26:16.943 --> 26:19.578
* You sing of loyalty

26:19.612 --> 26:21.914
* But you
the snitching ass bitch *

26:23.515 --> 26:25.084
* I tried to play it cool

26:25.117 --> 26:26.452
* Funny what people
do for money *

26:26.485 --> 26:28.487
* Power and fame

26:29.856 --> 26:31.824
* I'd call you Mr. Lyon,
if I did *

26:31.858 --> 26:33.059
* I would be lyin'

26:33.092 --> 26:35.995
* 'Cause that even your name

26:36.028 --> 26:39.899
* But people tell me
I'm just like my daddy *

26:39.932 --> 26:42.935
* People tell me I'm just
like my daddy *

26:42.969 --> 26:46.105
* They all say that you
look just like your daddy *

26:46.138 --> 26:48.307
* Nah, bruh...

26:51.978 --> 26:53.379
(whooping, applause)

26:55.147 --> 26:59.285
Jamal, are you saying
Lucious is inauthentic?

26:59.318 --> 27:01.620
I'm saying Lucious Lyon
ain't even his real name.

27:01.654 --> 27:02.989
(feedback squeals,
audience murmurs and gasps)

27:04.156 --> 27:05.792
THIRSTY:
You're a lucky lady.

27:05.825 --> 27:07.159
He wants to give you
an exclusive.

27:07.193 --> 27:09.962
Thank you so much
for coming back.

27:09.996 --> 27:11.964
Sorry about the other day.

27:11.998 --> 27:14.801
I was a bit out of sorts.

27:14.834 --> 27:15.835
And today?

27:15.868 --> 27:17.804
Well, it's a new day.

27:17.837 --> 27:20.039
Hm. I thought you
and Jamal were close.

27:20.072 --> 27:21.540
Has your family turned on you?

27:21.573 --> 27:25.377
What, that little bit
of flexing Jamal did?

27:25.411 --> 27:27.546
He called you "inauthentic."

27:27.579 --> 27:29.782
That seems a little bit
more than flexing.

27:29.816 --> 27:30.616
You gonna retaliate?

27:30.649 --> 27:31.818
Against my own boy.

27:33.419 --> 27:34.721
No.

27:34.754 --> 27:36.322
I'm going to thank him.

27:36.355 --> 27:37.957
Thank him.

27:37.990 --> 27:41.660
That little family jewel
that he dropped,

27:41.694 --> 27:43.730
was something very personal
and private

27:43.763 --> 27:46.565
that I entrusted to him.

27:46.598 --> 27:48.634
But once he did it,
I realized I don't

27:48.667 --> 27:50.737
have to keep it private no more.

27:50.770 --> 27:53.973
So now I'm actually changing
my whole concept of my video

27:54.006 --> 27:58.077
and I thought you might be
interested in that story.

27:58.110 --> 28:01.247
Well, that depends.
What's your story?

28:01.280 --> 28:05.417
Everybody knows the
Lucious Lyon story.

28:05.451 --> 28:08.020
How I started off poor,

28:08.054 --> 28:11.090
sold drugs to finance
my first album--

28:11.123 --> 28:14.994
I mean, damn near taught as
part of the school curriculum.

28:15.027 --> 28:17.163
But I've never shared
with anybody

28:17.196 --> 28:20.566
how I became Lucious Lyon.

28:20.599 --> 28:23.169
That's the exclusive
I'm offering you.

28:23.202 --> 28:26.372
It's the Dwight Walker story.

28:26.405 --> 28:29.175
How a homeless orphan,

28:29.208 --> 28:32.779
became Lucious Lyon.

28:47.426 --> 28:49.128
Rhonda, what you've gone
through can be traumatizing.

28:49.161 --> 28:50.462
It can fester in a marriage,

28:50.496 --> 28:53.632
but in the presence of God,

28:53.665 --> 28:54.801
you can unburden yourself.

28:54.834 --> 28:57.970
Oh, really?

28:58.004 --> 29:01.207
How about, uh,
I go first, Reverend?

29:01.240 --> 29:03.409
All right, Andre.

29:03.442 --> 29:06.412
(exhales) Okay.

29:06.445 --> 29:08.414
Rhonda,

29:08.447 --> 29:10.149
have you been cheating on me?

29:10.182 --> 29:12.384
What?!

29:12.418 --> 29:14.253
No.

29:15.687 --> 29:17.489
Rhonda,
if you're being truthful,

29:17.523 --> 29:20.392
let's try and understand why
Andre's doubting you.

29:20.426 --> 29:23.262
I do understand why
Andre's doubting me.

29:23.295 --> 29:24.897
It's because he's paranoid,

29:24.931 --> 29:27.099
which always precedes
a bipolar break.

29:27.133 --> 29:29.268
Has he told you about
his mental health?

29:29.301 --> 29:30.837
Paranoid how?

29:30.870 --> 29:32.839
He just accused me
of cheating on him,

29:32.872 --> 29:34.941
which is ridiculous.

29:34.974 --> 29:36.742
And also, he's been
having visions.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.811
Babe, have been telling him
about your visions?

29:38.845 --> 29:40.746
I told the reverend that
God's been speaking to me

29:40.779 --> 29:42.414
about what happened
to our child-- yes, I did.

29:42.448 --> 29:44.583
And that doesn't
alarm you at all.

29:44.616 --> 29:47.086
I believe that God speaks
to us in different ways.

29:47.119 --> 29:50.289
It's not my place
to doubt Andre.

29:52.291 --> 29:54.093
Where were you
last night, Rhonda?

29:54.126 --> 29:55.427
I was at work.

29:55.461 --> 29:56.896
I went to see you at work,
you weren't there.

30:00.399 --> 30:01.600
This isn't a
counseling session.

30:01.633 --> 30:03.702
This is a setup.

30:03.735 --> 30:05.838
Isn't it? Is that,
is that what this is?

30:05.872 --> 30:07.539
Wow, okay.

30:07.573 --> 30:09.341
Well, look, if you really
want to help my marriage,

30:09.375 --> 30:12.011
what you need to do is get Andre
to go get some medical help.

30:12.044 --> 30:14.680
He needs to see a doctor
to recalibrate his meds.

30:14.713 --> 30:17.616
That's the only thing that's
going to help my marriage.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.952
Of course I'm concerned
about Andre's health.

30:19.986 --> 30:21.453
Good, 'cause you should be.

30:21.487 --> 30:24.156
But the difference
between now and the past,

30:24.190 --> 30:27.026
is that he's also in God's care,

30:27.059 --> 30:30.329
which is far more powerful
than any doctor's medicine.

30:30.362 --> 30:33.165
Thank you, Reverend.

30:36.936 --> 30:39.038
Ma, where are they?

30:39.071 --> 30:40.639
They went to Andre's pastor

30:40.672 --> 30:43.342
for some marriage
counseling, child.

30:43.375 --> 30:44.911
Don't you think that
Dre needs more than

30:44.944 --> 30:46.879
a pastor?

30:46.913 --> 30:48.414
Dre needs more
than just meds.

30:48.447 --> 30:49.648
Know what I'm saying?

30:49.681 --> 30:50.883
What he really needs...
Hey.

30:50.917 --> 30:52.484
Cookie, would you do me a favor

30:52.518 --> 30:54.220
and tell Andre where I was

30:54.253 --> 30:55.721
last night at 8:00?

30:55.754 --> 30:59.525
Uh, she was in my office
snitching on Camilla.

30:59.558 --> 31:00.859
Did you hear that?
Cookie's office.

31:00.893 --> 31:02.261
So I was not in my office.

31:02.294 --> 31:04.730
I was spying on Camilla
for your family.

31:04.763 --> 31:05.864
That's right.

31:05.898 --> 31:07.934
Dre, this was your plan.

31:07.967 --> 31:09.568
Prove that the way Mimi

31:09.601 --> 31:13.439
and Camilla stole our
company is illegal, right?

31:13.472 --> 31:14.440
Thanks to Rhonda, here,

31:14.473 --> 31:16.175
we know that Mimi's in New York

31:16.208 --> 31:18.010
this weekend.

31:18.044 --> 31:19.711
And now all we got
to do is get Hakeem

31:19.745 --> 31:22.048
to get them to incriminate
themselves on tape.

31:22.081 --> 31:26.118
You know Hakeem will never
do it, okay? He's not with us.

31:26.152 --> 31:27.053
He's paranoid.

31:27.086 --> 31:28.620
COOKIE: Maybe,

31:28.654 --> 31:29.721
but Hakeem ain't here,

31:29.755 --> 31:31.290
and I told him to be.

31:31.323 --> 31:33.960
Yo, chill out, like, uh,
he's at a marketing meeting.

31:33.993 --> 31:35.027
He's going to be here.

31:35.061 --> 31:36.963
Yeah, well,
he better get this done

31:36.996 --> 31:38.797
'cause Lucious got
a itchy trigger finger...

31:38.830 --> 31:40.132
Oh, my goodness, y'all.

31:40.166 --> 31:42.468
I'll talk to Hakeem, come on.

31:42.501 --> 31:44.036
COOKIE:
You better.

31:44.070 --> 31:45.771
This one right here,
we can change the material.

31:45.804 --> 31:47.439
Yes, sir.
Make these gold right here.

31:50.176 --> 31:51.477
Be on time today.

31:51.510 --> 31:53.745
Yes, sir.

31:53.779 --> 31:55.647
Look y'all,
let me talk to my brother.

31:55.681 --> 31:56.915
Man, get out of here, please?

31:56.949 --> 31:57.783
Sure.

31:57.816 --> 31:58.951
Just go.

32:06.492 --> 32:10.496
If we get rid of Camilla...

32:10.529 --> 32:12.231
who gets Empire?

32:12.264 --> 32:14.166
I don't know, man, but...

32:14.200 --> 32:16.468
look, the board got rid of
Lucious and it got nasty,

32:16.502 --> 32:17.970
so it's not like they're
going to reinstate him.

32:18.004 --> 32:19.838
Yeah, but nobody thinks
I should have it.

32:19.871 --> 32:21.640
Who cares?

32:21.673 --> 32:23.775
I'm looking at your right now,
and you're a natural.

32:23.809 --> 32:25.444
You know, but it's not
going to be easy.

32:25.477 --> 32:26.979
You know, with everything
that you did.

32:27.013 --> 32:28.847
You got to really prove yourself
to the rest of the family.

32:28.880 --> 32:31.450
I will.

32:31.483 --> 32:32.851
Watch me.

32:36.989 --> 32:39.591
So babe...

32:39.625 --> 32:41.593
I'm sorry for being
a little extra.

32:41.627 --> 32:43.329
I'm not used to
this type of stuff.

32:43.362 --> 32:45.131
Just got a lot
on my mind right now.

32:45.164 --> 32:46.465
But it's what you always wanted.

32:46.498 --> 32:48.634
It is,
but I'm going to be honest,

32:48.667 --> 32:50.502
I couldn't be in this
position without you.

32:50.536 --> 32:51.670
You took on my family.

32:51.703 --> 32:53.839
You took out Lucious.

32:53.872 --> 32:55.807
And you did it all for me.

32:55.841 --> 32:56.975
You're my queen.

32:57.009 --> 32:58.310
* Right back
where I started... *

32:58.344 --> 33:00.312
Cheers.
Cheers.

33:04.650 --> 33:05.651
Come here.

33:08.587 --> 33:11.190
Am I still your mama?

33:11.223 --> 33:12.391
You'll always be my mama.

33:16.528 --> 33:18.664
*
(moaning passionately)

33:26.605 --> 33:28.574
Yep, come on, baby.

33:30.942 --> 33:32.978
So why you make me
so crazy?

33:33.011 --> 33:34.580
Mmm, I know.

33:34.613 --> 33:36.248
I can't see you
this weekend.

33:37.349 --> 33:38.584
Mimi.

33:38.617 --> 33:39.885
I thought she was sick.

33:39.918 --> 33:40.819
Not sick enough.

33:40.852 --> 33:42.754
I'm sorry,
is that awful?

33:42.788 --> 33:44.923
Why won't you just come clean
to her about me and you?

33:44.956 --> 33:46.325
Just be real.

33:46.358 --> 33:48.827
She's so possessive, darling.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.729
We'll lose everything--

33:50.762 --> 33:52.764
Empire, Antony and Cleopatra.

33:52.798 --> 33:54.733
I've worked very
hard for this.

33:54.766 --> 33:56.702
Try to be patient.

34:23.095 --> 34:26.298
* Run, run, run, run,

34:26.332 --> 34:27.799
* Run
* Hate, hate

34:27.833 --> 34:29.968
* Hate, hate, hate...

34:30.001 --> 34:31.170
JD, looks good.

34:32.671 --> 34:33.639
Takesha.

34:33.672 --> 34:34.706
Yo, what up, Hakeem?
What's up?

34:34.740 --> 34:35.741
My man.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.712
Y'all, our plan was iffy.

34:40.746 --> 34:42.881
Mimi's too sharp to get
caught by us saying stuff,

34:42.914 --> 34:44.750
so I changed tactics.

34:44.783 --> 34:46.985
Now look, I can't save
you from your father

34:47.018 --> 34:47.819
if go around changing...

34:47.853 --> 34:49.755
Mom, it's cool; just wait.

34:49.788 --> 34:52.658
What's your plan,
oh, grand master of espionage?

34:52.691 --> 34:55.994
I made a tape
and sent it to Mimi's hotel.
What kind of tape?

34:56.027 --> 34:58.497
Look, Mimi is
overprotective and jealous,

34:58.530 --> 35:02.934
so I made a tape of me
and Camilla doing the nasty.

35:02.968 --> 35:04.503
Oh!

35:04.536 --> 35:06.472
So you, you made

35:06.505 --> 35:08.006
a sex tape, huh, Ray-jay?

35:08.039 --> 35:09.808
Mom, she basically admitted
that she was using her

35:09.841 --> 35:11.177
to get back with me.

35:11.210 --> 35:13.179
And she said some
pretty rank things

35:13.212 --> 35:15.347
like she was hoping Mimi dies,
so I figure Mimi...

35:15.381 --> 35:17.516
Mimi is dumping all
of her Empire stock.

35:17.549 --> 35:19.818
Now, I don't know why,
but she's divesting.

35:19.851 --> 35:20.786
What are you doing, Dre?

35:20.819 --> 35:22.188
I'm calling the estate brokers.

35:22.221 --> 35:24.022
Tell them to buy up as many
shares as we can legally own.

35:24.055 --> 35:25.491
We need to move fast, brother.

35:25.524 --> 35:27.092
Damn, Hakeem.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.861
You did it.

35:29.895 --> 35:31.096
We're free.

35:31.129 --> 35:32.298
So now you believe in me, Ma?

35:32.331 --> 35:34.333
Boy, I always believed in you.

35:34.366 --> 35:35.701
I made you my partner, didn't I?

35:35.734 --> 35:37.603
You don't believe
that I can run Empire.

35:37.636 --> 35:38.870
You put your family first--

35:38.904 --> 35:41.540
that's a step
in the right direction.

35:41.573 --> 35:42.708
Buy it all.

35:42.741 --> 35:43.809
I don't care.
Buy it all.

35:43.842 --> 35:46.778
Drop everything,
put it all in Empire.

35:46.812 --> 35:48.414
Well, then,
buy it in Rhonda's name.

35:50.849 --> 35:52.984
Man.

35:53.018 --> 35:56.054
Listen, I, I, uh...

35:56.087 --> 35:58.390
I created a, a, a trust
in my son's name.

35:58.424 --> 36:00.826
Just buy, buy it in his name.

36:02.060 --> 36:04.230
Okay, mm-hmm.

36:04.263 --> 36:05.897
Good.

36:07.899 --> 36:09.301
Dre!

36:09.335 --> 36:10.669
Oh, my God.

36:10.702 --> 36:11.870
Hey!

36:11.903 --> 36:13.539
Dre! Dre!

36:13.572 --> 36:14.906
It's okay.

36:16.542 --> 36:17.509
No.

36:17.543 --> 36:19.411
Dre, come on, man...

36:19.445 --> 36:20.679
Hey, man, come down
to the studio.

36:20.712 --> 36:22.047
Me and Hakeem got
something for you to hear.

36:22.080 --> 36:23.882
Yeah, come on,
let's go to the studio.
Okay.

36:23.915 --> 36:25.083
Yeah.

36:25.116 --> 36:26.652
What is this?

36:26.685 --> 36:29.421
Well, um, Hakeem and
I wrote you a song,

36:29.455 --> 36:31.923
'cause we know that you're going
through a seriously hard time,

36:31.957 --> 36:34.426
and it's all that we know
how to do, so...

36:34.460 --> 36:35.761
we're here for you.

36:35.794 --> 36:36.828
It's going to be okay.

36:36.862 --> 36:37.596
Sit down.

36:40.131 --> 36:43.902
(slow rhythmic intro begins)

36:51.610 --> 36:54.045
* Sometimes it's hard to pray

36:56.282 --> 36:58.850
* Sometimes, it's hard to stay

36:58.884 --> 37:01.152
* Grateful

37:03.655 --> 37:06.758
* It's painful

37:06.792 --> 37:09.461
* Hurts so bad

37:10.429 --> 37:13.965
* Sometimes it's hard to be

37:13.999 --> 37:16.302
Mm...

37:16.335 --> 37:19.938
* It's hard to keep going

37:19.971 --> 37:24.643
* But we keep holding

37:24.676 --> 37:28.280
* On to what could have been

37:28.314 --> 37:30.081
* But we'll get by

37:30.115 --> 37:31.817
* We'll see the light

37:31.850 --> 37:37.656
* In the morning, it's going
to be all right *

37:37.689 --> 37:39.157
* Circumstance

37:39.190 --> 37:42.394
* Is in the plan

37:42.428 --> 37:45.964
* Even if we don't
fully understand *

37:45.997 --> 37:48.967
* Why the bad things

37:49.000 --> 37:51.837
* Happen to the good people

37:51.870 --> 37:54.005
* So much pain

37:54.039 --> 37:55.341
* It's still a lesson

37:55.374 --> 37:58.410
* Sometimes it rains

37:58.444 --> 38:01.179
* It's still a blessing

38:01.212 --> 38:03.482
* You never see the silver
lining in the cloud *

38:03.515 --> 38:05.617
* And so you doubt it

38:05.651 --> 38:07.018
* You never know how much

38:07.052 --> 38:09.655
* You truly have until
you go without it *

38:11.557 --> 38:14.192
* One day it's going to turn
into another season *

38:14.225 --> 38:15.327
* Gonna change

38:15.361 --> 38:16.328
* You're going to see that

38:16.362 --> 38:17.496
* All your tragedy you had

38:17.529 --> 38:18.830
* Was for another reason

38:18.864 --> 38:21.032
* It's just
a temporary good-bye *

38:21.066 --> 38:23.635
* So you got to keep
your head high *

38:23.669 --> 38:25.704
* The rain is coming down
and it's pouring *

38:25.737 --> 38:26.972
* But joy is going to come

38:27.005 --> 38:28.206
* Inside the morning

38:28.239 --> 38:29.541
* Whoo!

38:29.575 --> 38:30.709
* We'll get by

38:30.742 --> 38:31.843
* By

38:31.877 --> 38:33.044
* We'll see the light

38:33.078 --> 38:34.045
* Yeah

38:34.079 --> 38:35.347
* In the morning

38:35.381 --> 38:37.215
* It's gonna be all right

38:37.248 --> 38:38.884
* It's gonna be okay, baby

38:38.917 --> 38:40.051
* Circumstance

38:40.085 --> 38:40.952
* The Lord gotcha

38:40.986 --> 38:41.887
* Is in the plan

38:41.920 --> 38:43.689
HAKEEM:
* And I gotcha

38:43.722 --> 38:48.059
JAMAL: * Even if we don't
fully understand why *

38:48.093 --> 38:50.362
* Understand why

38:50.396 --> 38:52.864
* Understand why

38:52.898 --> 38:54.400
* The bad things

38:54.433 --> 38:59.237
* Happen to the good people.

38:59.270 --> 39:00.338
(sighs)

39:06.912 --> 39:09.381
LUCIOUS: So I hear
Hakeem's cleaning up
that mess he created.

39:09.415 --> 39:11.049
Yeah, just call your lawyers.

39:11.082 --> 39:12.484
They'll tell you--

39:12.518 --> 39:14.853
Mimi's getting rid
of all of her stock.

39:14.886 --> 39:16.588
She's probably getting rid
of that bitch, Camilla,

39:16.622 --> 39:18.690
right about now.
Really?

39:18.724 --> 39:19.825
Mm-hmm.

39:19.858 --> 39:21.226
I think I'd like to see that.

39:21.259 --> 39:24.095
Ugh, Lucious,
everything is done.

39:24.129 --> 39:25.831
You don't need to do anything.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.098
Where are you going?

39:27.132 --> 39:29.835
I'm going home
and celebrate by myself.

39:29.868 --> 39:31.236
Good work, Cook.

39:31.269 --> 39:32.671
You pulled it together.

39:32.704 --> 39:35.006
I know. (chuckles)

39:35.040 --> 39:36.307
I always do.

39:55.160 --> 39:58.630
You know, nobody's going to
believe that she killed herself.

39:58.664 --> 39:59.931
I mean, they might have,

39:59.965 --> 40:02.100
had I not watched you pour

40:02.133 --> 40:03.268
that stuff in her drink.

40:03.301 --> 40:04.369
Get out.

40:04.402 --> 40:06.237
What was that stuff
you poured in her drink?

40:06.271 --> 40:09.307
Was that cyanide or arsenic?

40:09.340 --> 40:11.910
Hakeem's going to kill you
when he finds out what you did.

40:11.943 --> 40:14.279
What'd you say?

40:15.413 --> 40:17.315
I'll go, but first
I got to stop over

40:17.348 --> 40:19.918
at the police
and make sure they get the video

40:19.951 --> 40:22.954
of you and Mimi's
last few precious moments.

40:22.988 --> 40:25.824
Not to mention a video
of you and Hakeem.

40:25.857 --> 40:28.126
He'll never forgive you.

40:28.159 --> 40:29.595
What are you talking about?

40:32.698 --> 40:36.201
It was Hakeem that sent
the videos to Mimi.

40:38.637 --> 40:39.971
How's that feel?

40:40.972 --> 40:43.341
Knowing it was your Hakeem.

40:43.374 --> 40:45.010
Your little prince,

40:45.043 --> 40:47.412
that did all of that to you.

40:47.445 --> 40:51.016
He used you and got what
he wanted from you,

40:51.049 --> 40:53.819
and now don't want nothing more
to do with you than I do.

40:53.852 --> 40:55.453
I mean, if I was you,

40:55.487 --> 40:57.789
just FYI, I would think
about maybe offing myself.

40:57.823 --> 40:59.457
I mean the police
are probably going to think

40:59.491 --> 41:03.261
it's a double suicide
or a murder-suicide.

41:03.294 --> 41:04.696
It don't matter.

41:04.730 --> 41:07.065
You're going to be dead.

41:09.334 --> 41:12.971
That feeling you got right now?

41:13.004 --> 41:15.140
That's prison.

41:15.173 --> 41:17.709
But a million times worse.

41:17.743 --> 41:21.212
And don't forget you got to
constantly be aware of the fact

41:21.246 --> 41:23.281
that somebody's going
to try and rape you,

41:23.314 --> 41:25.050
or murder you, or just

41:25.083 --> 41:28.720
the general unsanitary
conditions of the place.

41:28.754 --> 41:32.157
(sobbing):
What have I done?

41:32.190 --> 41:34.059
You committed murder, Camilla.

41:34.092 --> 41:37.395
Now, I got to tell
Mimi's family.

41:37.428 --> 41:40.031
That means you're going to have
to face them in court.

41:40.065 --> 41:41.867
Come on...

41:41.900 --> 41:44.402
it'd be a whole lot easier
and a whole lot less mess,

41:44.435 --> 41:47.138
if you just take a swig
of whatever that was

41:47.172 --> 41:49.507
that you made Mimi drink.

41:49.541 --> 41:53.411
Why don't you shoot me, please?

41:53.444 --> 41:56.882
After all the pain
you caused my family,

41:56.915 --> 41:59.084
I don't owe you any favors.

41:59.117 --> 42:02.654
Nah, you're going to have
to off yourself.

42:02.688 --> 42:03.722
Go ahead.

42:19.037 --> 42:20.606
(bottle clatters across floor)

42:20.639 --> 42:21.773
(sobs, sniffles)

42:21.807 --> 42:23.374
Rot in Hell.

43:04.015 --> 43:04.983
Yeah.

43:05.016 --> 43:06.985
