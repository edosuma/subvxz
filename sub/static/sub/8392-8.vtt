00:03.410 --> 00:04.786

WE MIGHT WANT TO START HAVIN'
A SERIOUS CONVERSATION

00:06.970 --> 00:08.176

00:10.110 --> 00:11.384

00:11.490 --> 00:12.934
- IT WAS A SHORT VISIT.
NO ONE GOT HURT.

00:13.040 --> 00:14.416
- I DON'T WANT
TO BE REPLACED.

00:14.530 --> 00:16.418
- WE DO OWE IT TO EACH OTHER
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION

00:16.530 --> 00:19.078
BEFORE WE BRING JABBAR AROUND
ANYONE WE'RE DATING.

00:19.190 --> 00:21.636
- IS SETH SOMETHING
THAT I NEED TO WORRY ABOUT?

00:21.740 --> 00:22.946
- NO, I ADORE YOU.

00:23.050 --> 00:25.359
- SETH, YOU NEED HELP.

00:25.470 --> 00:27.085
- I'M GONNA REGRET
NOT LISTENING TO MY WIFE,

00:27.190 --> 00:29.465
BECAUSE IF I DID,
MAYBE WE'D STILL BE A FAMILY.

00:32.410 --> 00:35.379
- UH, AND WHAT
RELEVANT EXPERIENCE DO YOU HAVE

00:35.480 --> 00:37.755
THAT QUALIFIES YOU
FOR THIS JOB?

00:37.860 --> 00:39.851
- DEFINE
"RELEVANT EXPERIENCE."

00:39.970 --> 00:42.416
YOU KNOW?

00:42.520 --> 00:43.373
- I LIKE MUSIC.

00:43.490 --> 00:45.276
- IT'S A JOB
ANSWERING THE PHONE.

00:45.390 --> 00:47.585
BEEN DOIN' THAT
FOR MY ENTIRE LIFE.

00:47.700 --> 00:49.008
- YEAH.

00:49.110 --> 00:51.317
- FOR STARTERS,
I KNOW ALL THE LOCAL BANDS.

00:51.430 --> 00:52.692
- TELL US
ABOUT YOUR LAST JOB.

00:52.810 --> 00:53.595
- WHY?
WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD?

00:53.700 --> 00:54.974
- WHERE DO YOU SEE YOURSELF
IN TWO YEARS?

00:55.080 --> 00:57.537
- LOOK, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE
I'M GOIN' AFTER THIS MEETING.

00:57.640 --> 00:58.971
- OWNING MY OWN LABEL.

00:59.090 --> 01:00.159
- PROBABLY
OWNING MY OWN LABEL.

01:00.260 --> 01:02.319
- ULTIMATELY
I'D REALLY LIKE TO MANAGE,

01:02.440 --> 01:04.886
SO I'M HOPING THAT I'LL BE
ON TRACK TO DO THAT.

01:04.990 --> 01:06.150
- ANYTHING ELSE
YOU WANT TO TELL US?

01:06.270 --> 01:07.407
- I DON'T MAKE COFFEE.

01:07.510 --> 01:09.432
- I'M GONNA NEED THE ENTIRE
MONTH OF NOVEMBER OFF.

01:09.550 --> 01:11.643

YOU KNOW, 401K.

01:11.760 --> 01:13.091
- OKAY.

01:13.210 --> 01:14.131
- THIS WAS GREAT.
- YEAH.

01:14.240 --> 01:15.059
- I GUESS
JUST ONE MORE THING?

01:15.170 --> 01:17.650
- YEAH, UH,
WHY DID YOU DROP OUT?

01:17.760 --> 01:20.001
- HONESTLY,
BECAUSE I KNEW IN MY HEART

01:20.110 --> 01:23.523
THAT I'D RATHER BE AT BOTTOM
OF THE HILL THREE NIGHTS A WEEK,

01:23.630 --> 01:26.622
LISTENING TO THE NEXT GREAT BAND
THAN FINISHING MY MASTER'S,

01:26.740 --> 01:32.804
AND, UM, AS CHEESY AS IT SOUNDS,
I THINK THAT LIFE IS JUST

01:32.920 --> 01:36.742
WAY TOO SHORT TO DO ANYTHING
OTHER THAN WHAT YOU LOVE.

01:36.850 --> 01:38.579
- YEAH.
- [laughs]

01:38.680 --> 01:40.534
- YEAH, SHE WAS GOOD.
- OH, SHE'S JUST GOOD?

01:40.650 --> 01:41.856
- YOU KNOW, WE GOT SOME
OTHER PEOPLE WE HAVE TO SEE,

01:41.960 --> 01:43.336
WE'VE GOT OTHER APPLICANTS
LINED UP.

01:43.440 --> 01:45.749
- LISTEN, SHE'S SMART,
SHE'S HUMBLE,

01:45.860 --> 01:48.272
SHE KNOWS MORE
ABOUT THE MUSIC SCENE THAN I DO,

01:48.380 --> 01:49.517
SO I DON'T SEE
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM.

01:49.620 --> 01:51.793
- IT'S A PROCESS, CROSBY,
WE'VE GO'I'I'A FOLLOW IT THROUGH.

01:51.900 --> 01:54.004
- YEAH, WE JUST TOOK A LOOK
AT WHAT'S OUT THERE.

01:54.110 --> 01:55.179
WHAT IS YOUR HESITATION?

01:55.280 --> 01:56.861
_ 1--
- IS IT 'CAUSE SHE'S HOT?

01:56.970 --> 01:57.959
IT'S 'CAUSE SHE'S HOT.

01:58.080 --> 01:59.035
- I BARELY EVEN NOTICED
THAT SHE WAS HOT.

01:59.150 --> 02:01.618
- OH, YOU--YOU DIDN'T NOTICE
THAT SHE WAS HOT?

02:01.740 --> 02:02.968
DID YOU HAVE YOUR EYES CLOSED?
- [laughs]

02:03.080 --> 02:05.640
- LISTEN, IT DOES NOT MAKE US
SLEAZY IF WE HIRE A PRETTY GIRL.

02:05.740 --> 02:07.844
AND THIS IS NOT
THE SHOE INDUSTRY, OKAY?

02:07.950 --> 02:09.429
WE HAVE MUSICIANS IN HERE.

02:09.540 --> 02:11.531
IT WOULD NOT KILL US TO HAVE
A LITTLE EYE CANDY UP FRONT.

02:11.640 --> 02:13.084
- I'M GONNA PRETEND
YOU DIDN'T SAY THAT, OKAY?

02:13.200 --> 02:14.189
I KNOW IT'S NOT
THE SHOE INDUSTRY.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.289
- WELL, YOU'RE ALREADY
PRETENDING

02:15.410 --> 02:16.263
THAT YOU DIDN'T NOTICE
HOW HOT SHE IS,

02:16.370 --> 02:17.644
SO WHY NOT PRETEND THAT,
AS WELL?

02:17.750 --> 02:19.126
- ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I ADMIT IT. SHE WAS ATTRACTIVE.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.299
OKAY? YOU HAPPY?
- OH, OKAY, GOOD.

02:21.410 --> 02:22.616
HERE WE GO,
NOW WE'RE SPEAKING HONESTLY.

02:22.720 --> 02:25.416
LISTEN,
IS THIS A KRISTINA FEAR?

02:25.520 --> 02:27.249
YOU THINK SHE'S GONNA
BE THREATENED, OR SOMETHING?

02:27.350 --> 02:28.248
'CAUSE SHE'LL BE FINE.

02:28.350 --> 02:29.339
- OH, REALLY?
AND YOU KNOW THIS HOW?

02:29.450 --> 02:31.623
- 'CAUSE YOU GUYS
HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR 20 YEARS,

02:31.730 --> 02:33.243
AND YOU'RE SOMEHOW
STILL HOT FOR EACH OTHER.

02:33.360 --> 02:34.907
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE, BUT--
- YEAH.

02:35.010 --> 02:36.284
- OR NOT?
- HMM?

02:36.390 --> 02:37.493
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
THINGS AREN'T AS--

02:37.600 --> 02:40.285
- LOOK, WE'RE JUST EXPERIENCING
THE USUAL DRY SPELL

02:40.400 --> 02:42.459
AFTER A PREGNANCY, OKAY?
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

02:42.570 --> 02:43.776
DON'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT
ANYMORE.

02:43.880 --> 02:47.088
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT.

02:47.200 --> 02:48.269
- MAYBE
YOU NEED TO SEDUCE HER.

02:48.370 --> 02:50.190
- I DON'T NEED TO SEDUCE HER,
OKAY?

02:50.300 --> 02:51.232
- I'M JUST SAYIN',
YOU COULD MAKE HER A NICE MEAL,

02:51.340 --> 02:54.161
AND PUT ON MUSIC,
AND LIGHT CANDLES. THAT'LL WORK.

02:54.270 --> 02:55.953
- THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT,
CROSBY.

02:56.070 --> 02:57.207
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THIS IS.

02:57.310 --> 03:00.541
THIS IS ABOUT THE SENSITIVE TIME
AFTER HAVING A BABY,

03:00.660 --> 03:01.991
WHEN THE WOMAN HAS
BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH,

03:02.110 --> 03:04.317
THE MAN CAN'T INITIATE THINGS,
OKAY?

03:04.420 --> 03:06.217
SHE DOESN'T FEEL ATTRACTIVE,
HE'S GOTTA BE PATIENT,

03:06.320 --> 03:07.173
IT CAN GO ON FOR MONTHS.
IT'S JUST--

03:07.290 --> 03:08.450
- OKAY,
I'M SORRY I ASKED.

03:08.560 --> 03:10.073
- YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M UP AGAINST HERE.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.043
- BACK TO RACHEL.

03:11.150 --> 03:12.356
ARE WE GONNA HIRE HER?
YES OR NO?

03:12.460 --> 03:14.018
BEFORE YOU ANSWER,
LET ME WARN YOU,

03:14.120 --> 03:16.111
WE CAN'T RULE HER OUT,
JUST BECAUSE SHE'S ATTRACTIVE.

03:16.230 --> 03:17.390
THAT'S ILLEGAL.
- [laughs]

03:17.500 --> 03:18.603
- AND I DO NOT WANT TO END UP
IN A LAWSUIT OVER THIS.

03:18.710 --> 03:20.678
- YEAH, DISCRIMINATION.
- EXACTLY.

03:20.780 --> 03:22.156
- AGAINST ATTRACT IVEN ESS.
- YUP.

03:22.270 --> 03:23.362
- WELL--
- IT CAN GO BOTH WAYS.

03:23.470 --> 03:24.789
- THANK YOU FOR KEEPING US
OUT OF THE COURTROOM.

03:24.890 --> 03:26.949
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

03:27.060 --> 03:28.379
- AW, BROTHER.
- BUT AS FAR AS...

03:28.480 --> 03:30.232
- I TELL YA,
I CAN'T KEEP TRACK OF--

03:30.340 --> 03:32.023
- YOU SAID FOUR.
- TWO.

03:32.140 --> 03:33.277
- HEY, GUYS.
- THIS IS NOT--[laughs]

03:33.380 --> 03:35.371
- HEY, MR. BRAVERMAN.

03:35.490 --> 03:38.379
GRANDSON.
- HEY.

03:38.490 --> 03:39.866
- YOU HAVEN'T SEEN MY KEYS,
HAVE YOU?

03:39.970 --> 03:42.552
- UM,
I DON'T THINK SO, NO.

03:42.670 --> 03:44.661
- HUH.
- DID YOU TAKE HIS KEYS?

03:44.770 --> 03:47.568
- I DIDN'T TAKE--
I DIDN'T TAKE YOUR KEYS.

03:47.670 --> 03:52.118
- HEY, DREW, DID YOU INVITE AMY
TO THE--TO THE PARTY?

03:52.230 --> 03:54.369

03:54.470 --> 03:55.983
- YOU DIDN'T TELL HER?

03:56.090 --> 03:58.263

03:58.370 --> 04:00.429
ON HAIGHT-ASHBURY, RIGHT?

04:00.550 --> 04:04.611
THERE'S GONNA BE MUSIC,
AND FOOD, AND FREE BAR.

04:04.720 --> 04:06.654
WAIT. I MEAN,
FORGET THAT LAST PART.

04:06.760 --> 04:09.308
- IT'S GONNA BE A TOUGH NIGHT,
I MEAN, LET'S BE HONEST.

04:09.420 --> 04:11.581
- IT ACT UALLY--
IT SOUNDS PRETTY COOL TO ME.

04:11.690 --> 04:12.657
DO YOU WANT TO GO?
- YEAH!

04:12.760 --> 04:14.523
- YOU WANT TO--I MEAN...

04:14.630 --> 04:16.552

04:19.810 --> 04:20.902
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A GREAT TIME.
- THERE'S A LIST.

04:21.010 --> 04:22.147
WE'RE ON THE LIST.

04:22.260 --> 04:24.285
- WELL, YOU SHOULD INVITE
YOUR GIRLFRIEND TO STUFF, DREW,

04:24.400 --> 04:26.015
COME ON, MAN.

04:26.120 --> 04:29.294

04:29.400 --> 04:30.367
- SORRY, HE'S--

04:30.470 --> 04:32.290

ABOUT THIS.

04:32.410 --> 04:36.403
- IT'S ALL GOOD.

04:36.510 --> 04:38.330

04:38.450 --> 04:41.783

04:41.900 --> 04:43.276
- DUDE, YOU'RE GONNA BREAK IT.
LET ME DO IT.

04:43.380 --> 04:44.233
LET ME TRY IT.

04:44.350 --> 04:45.999

05:01.020 --> 05:03.329
YEAH, I KNOW IT SUCKS,
BUT IT'S AFFORDABLE.

07:39.730 --> 07:41.834
I DON'T THINK IT'S
THE MOST HELPFUL ENVIRONMENT,

07:41.940 --> 07:45.319

YOU KNOW, HOPE FOR THE BEST.

07:45.430 --> 07:48.183

08:02.270 --> 08:03.237
- WHERE WOULD YOU STAY?

08:03.340 --> 08:04.819
- I COULD STAY HERE.

08:04.930 --> 08:06.443
IF IT'S HELPFUL.
- OH, AMBER, YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

08:06.550 --> 08:08.404
NO, NO, NO.
IT'S YOUR NEW PLACE.

08:08.520 --> 08:11.034
- MOM, IT'S OKAY,
YOU KNOW,

08:11.140 --> 08:13.108
IF IT'LL BE HELPFUL FOR YOU,
AND STUFF.

08:13.210 --> 08:15.929
IT'S TOTALLY OKAY.

08:24.500 --> 08:27.355

08:51.040 --> 08:52.553

08:54.940 --> 08:59.525

SO THAT'S WHY THEY ASKED US.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.323

LOOKING MORE LIKE

14:40.460 --> 14:43.588
THE PLACE YOU GO TO DO DRUGS,

23:01.930 --> 23:08.278
REALLY. I MEAN,
IT'S NOT...ABOUT...HIM.

23:08.380 --> 23:11.133
IT'S JUST...

23:11.250 --> 23:16.529
TO SEE SETH BECOMING THE MAN
I ALWAYS THOUGHT HE COULD BE

23:16.630 --> 23:24.150
ALL THOSE YEARS,
IT IS KIND OF MOVING.

23:24.260 --> 23:27.434

23:27.540 --> 23:30.600
- MM. HE'S THE FATHER
OF YOUR CHILDREN.

23:30.710 --> 23:34.362
IT HAS TO DO WITH YOUR WHOLE
SENSE OF BEING A FAMILY AGAIN.

23:34.480 --> 23:41.966
- NO, MOM, I--
I PICTURE THE TWO OF US...

23:42.070 --> 23:43.992

IS JUST SO STRANGE,

23:52.530 --> 23:55.522
BECAUSE I'VE NEVER
BEEN HAPPIER.

23:55.640 --> 23:59.155
MARK KEEPS ASKING ME IF
THERE'S ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT,

23:59.260 --> 24:04.391

I'M FINE WITH YOU
DATIN' JASMINE. THAT'S TERRIFIC.

27:43.830 --> 27:46.105
BUT I NEED YOU TO RECOGNIZE
THAT THERE ARE MOMENTS

27:46.210 --> 27:48.826
I WANT TO SHARE WITH MY SON,
ME AND HIM, NOT YOU AND HIM.

27:48.940 --> 27:51.249
HARRY POTTER?
THAT WAS ONE OF 'EM,

27:51.350 --> 27:53.284
BUT I DON'T THINK YOU

27:53.390 --> 27:55.312
AND NOW THE FOOTBALL GAME?

27:55.430 --> 27:58.399
I AM NOT LETTING YOU TAKE HIM

27:58.500 --> 28:00.115
I DESERVE TO BE THERE
WITH HIM.

28:00.230 --> 28:02.607
I'M THE ONE THAT GETS TO SEE
HIS FACE LIGHT UP

28:02.710 --> 28:04.678
WHEN HE SEES THE FIELD
FOR THE FIRST TIME,

28:04.780 --> 28:06.953
AND I'M THE ONE WHO GETS TO
RELIVE THAT MOMENT

28:07.060 --> 28:09.506
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE,
NOT YOU.

28:09.610 --> 28:11.430
SO I NEED YOU

28:43.230 --> 28:45.619
SO I JUST SWAPPED OUT
