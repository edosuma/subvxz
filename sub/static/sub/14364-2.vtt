00:00.597 --> 00:03.499
Previously on Transformers Prime

00:03.952 --> 00:06.735
The Cons are back!
Cliff might be neck-deep in scrap!

00:08.199 --> 00:11.521
Cliffjumper's life signal...
just went offline.

00:11.556 --> 00:12.734
As of today

00:12.735 --> 00:16.626
only we five Autobots
remain on this Earth.

00:17.322 --> 00:18.295
W-w-what are they?

00:18.296 --> 00:20.352
Talking cars that turn into robots...

00:20.736 --> 00:22.236
Or the other way around.

00:23.064 --> 00:26.381
Look, you may be in danger
because you are one of the few,

00:26.416 --> 00:29.230
one of the only who have ever seen us.

00:29.265 --> 00:32.325
- Why are you here?
- To protect your planet

00:32.643 --> 00:34.100
from Megatron.

00:34.101 --> 00:36.457
But if his return is imminent,

00:36.492 --> 00:38.745
it could be catastrophic.

00:38.780 --> 00:41.428
I have returned!

00:43.000 --> 00:49.074

00:58.351 --> 01:01.104
Of the enegon deposits we have located

01:01.104 --> 01:03.317
while you were away, Lord Megatron,

01:03.883 --> 01:07.536
this one is by far
the most significant.

01:08.948 --> 01:12.933
The drones have been mining
without a pause during your absence,

01:13.139 --> 01:16.009
and have amassed quite a stockpile.

01:16.252 --> 01:18.479
You there! Fetch me a sample!

01:18.907 --> 01:20.407
Starscream!

01:22.373 --> 01:24.280
Now that I have returned

01:24.315 --> 01:27.659
I will issue the commands.

01:29.047 --> 01:32.785
I... Understand, Lord Megatron.

01:33.264 --> 01:35.555
Then as your humble servant,

01:35.770 --> 01:37.728
shall I ready the Space Bridge

01:37.763 --> 01:40.680
to bring forth the Decepticon army

01:40.715 --> 01:44.995
you have surely gathered
during your three years in space?

01:45.225 --> 01:47.313
My army will come.

01:47.950 --> 01:50.313
But my time away has yielded a more...

01:50.348 --> 01:53.640
intriguing means of materializing them.

01:53.675 --> 01:57.128
The solidified form of the matter
the ancient texts referred to...

01:57.163 --> 02:00.784
as the Blood of Unicron!

02:02.127 --> 02:04.264
Unicron the Destroyer...

02:04.299 --> 02:07.887
But it is said that his blood
is the anti-Spark!

02:08.788 --> 02:11.174
Plucked from cosmic shores,

02:11.471 --> 02:15.980
gaze upon Dark Energon!

02:16.015 --> 02:18.886
Legend tells that it
holds the power to...

02:19.451 --> 02:21.285
...revive the dead.

02:21.320 --> 02:24.388
We require only
a cadaver to be certain.

02:24.838 --> 02:27.877
Are you willing to make
the ultimate sacrifice?

02:29.557 --> 02:31.989
Hehehe, ahem, that
may not be necessary.

02:32.356 --> 02:34.968
If I may, Lord Megatron?

02:45.426 --> 02:48.767
Consider it a welcome-home present.

03:05.810 --> 03:08.492
And since you
now know of our existance,

03:08.827 --> 03:10.910
I fear that as of last night

03:10.945 --> 03:13.495
the Decepticons know of yours.

03:13.530 --> 03:16.216
Got it, we spot any strange
 vehicles, call 911...

03:16.869 --> 03:20.064
- Can... we go now?
- Are you insane?

03:20.099 --> 03:22.670
I'm living a dream
here in Bots-wana

03:22.705 --> 03:25.735
and I will not allow
you or anyone else to shatter it!

03:25.770 --> 03:28.944
It is best that you three
remain under our watch.

03:29.373 --> 03:33.098
At least until we can
determine our enemies' intentions.

03:33.133 --> 03:35.527
Optimus. With all due respect,

03:35.562 --> 03:38.400
the human children are
in as much danger

03:38.435 --> 03:40.689
- here as anywhere!
- Children?!

03:41.055 --> 03:43.120
They have no protective shell!

03:43.155 --> 03:45.395
If they get underfoot they will go...

03:45.966 --> 03:47.707
Squish!

03:49.369 --> 03:51.771
Then for the time being, Ratchet,

03:51.806 --> 03:54.212
we must watch where we step.

03:58.771 --> 04:00.271
What's that?

04:03.211 --> 04:04.648
Proximity sensor

04:04.649 --> 04:06.369
someone's on top.

04:06.882 --> 04:08.382
It's agent Fowler.

04:10.563 --> 04:13.151
I-I thoght we were the
only humans who know about you guys.

04:13.186 --> 04:14.703
Special agent Fowler

04:14.738 --> 04:18.094
is our designated liason
to the outside world,

04:18.129 --> 04:21.857
as he tends to visit
only when there are issues.

04:22.280 --> 04:25.405
It may be best if you
do not meet him at this time.

04:32.766 --> 04:37.217
Seven wrecks, thirty four fender benders,
a three hour traffic jam,

04:37.570 --> 04:39.253
and on particular note

04:39.288 --> 04:43.300
numerous reports of a speeding
motorcycle of unknown make

04:43.335 --> 04:45.677
and a black-and-yellow custom muscle car!

04:49.540 --> 04:53.162
So, anything you care
to get up your tin chassis, Prime?

04:53.444 --> 04:56.766
We have the situation
under control, agent Fowler.

04:56.801 --> 04:58.462
They're back, aren't they?

04:58.729 --> 05:01.217
If you are referring
to the Decepticons

05:01.676 --> 05:03.993
I have doubts that they ever left.

05:04.208 --> 05:06.858
Your planet is much too valuable.

05:06.893 --> 05:09.392
Than it's time to wake up the Pentagon.

05:09.567 --> 05:11.557
Hear me, agent Fowler.

05:11.876 --> 05:12.989
We are your best,

05:12.990 --> 05:17.153
possibly your only defense
against the Decepticon threat.

05:17.538 --> 05:19.038
Says you.

05:19.167 --> 05:20.667
Hey, fleshy!

05:20.700 --> 05:23.296
Did anyone get
splattered on that freeway?

05:23.331 --> 05:26.132
Team Prime knows when to use force...

05:26.985 --> 05:29.379
And how much to use.

05:29.414 --> 05:32.017
Bulkhead! I needed that!

05:32.052 --> 05:33.552
Enough!

05:33.847 --> 05:37.415
Military envolvement will
only result in catastrophy.

05:38.015 --> 05:42.664
Perhaps you can condone widespread
human casualties, agent Fowler.

05:42.944 --> 05:45.537
I, however, cannot.

05:45.572 --> 05:48.525
Then do us both a favor
and handle this, Prime!

05:48.560 --> 05:50.500
Under the radar.

05:53.979 --> 05:55.479
Or I will.

05:58.111 --> 06:01.202
Pretty big bearings...
for a human.

06:01.237 --> 06:04.702
Agent Fowler is concerned
for his world Bulkhead,

06:05.054 --> 06:06.694
as he should be.

06:13.184 --> 06:16.220
Let us see if power born of darkness

06:16.642 --> 06:18.867
can reignite the spark.

07:07.553 --> 07:08.960
That's your plan?!

07:08.961 --> 07:12.110
Bring Autobots back
from the dead to attack us?!

07:12.510 --> 07:15.324
That is no longer an Autobot.

07:15.359 --> 07:17.472
Just a mindless beast,

07:17.507 --> 07:20.910
its only instinct to destroy
anything in it's path.

07:31.330 --> 07:32.851
There, Starscream,

07:32.886 --> 07:36.197
lies the indestructible
 seed of my army.

07:36.232 --> 07:38.314
The ultimate weapon!

07:46.611 --> 07:49.242
Once I learn to control it.

07:54.534 --> 07:56.260
Blasted Earth check!

07:56.295 --> 07:58.789
Cliffjumper's signal
popped back online.

07:58.824 --> 08:02.240
- Who's Cliffjumper?
- How is that possible?

08:02.275 --> 08:03.643
It isn't.

08:03.644 --> 08:06.939
Another bug! The system
is chock-full of them.

08:07.178 --> 08:09.136
If there's any chance Cliff's alive...

08:09.171 --> 08:11.924
Ratchet, prepare sickbay.

08:11.959 --> 08:13.475
We may need it.

08:15.207 --> 08:16.707
Hey! What can we do?

08:17.265 --> 08:18.883
Remain with Ratchet.

08:26.593 --> 08:29.320
Autobots, roll out!

08:33.277 --> 08:34.910
What... Just happened?

08:35.265 --> 08:37.623
I transported them
to the designated coordinates

08:37.658 --> 08:39.250
via the Ground Bridge.

08:39.284 --> 08:41.383
What's a 'ground bridge'?

08:43.479 --> 08:47.494
Ugh... A scaled down version
of Space Bridge technology.

08:47.529 --> 08:51.354
Since we don't currently possess
the means or the energon

08:51.389 --> 08:54.058
required for intergalactic travel.

08:54.324 --> 08:57.027
You're stuck here. On Earth.

08:57.062 --> 08:59.088
With the likes of you, yes.

08:59.123 --> 09:02.326
But I constructed the Ground Bridge

09:07.338 --> 09:08.976
Wow! Does it work for humans?

09:09.447 --> 09:10.592
Naturally.

09:10.593 --> 09:12.452
You mean I could just

09:12.452 --> 09:14.273
shoot on over
and visit my parents in Tokyo?

09:14.308 --> 09:15.673
Within moments.

09:15.674 --> 09:19.293
In fact allow me to send you
there immediately, all three of you.

09:20.289 --> 09:21.789
Watch it, Ratchet.

09:32.456 --> 09:33.960
Energon mine!

09:35.030 --> 09:36.671
Judging by it's scale

09:36.706 --> 09:40.709
the Decepticons have been tunneling
here for quite some time.

09:54.813 --> 09:57.022
Let's find Cliffjumper!

10:49.117 --> 10:50.617
What is this anyway?

10:50.750 --> 10:52.250
Broken, don't touch it.

10:54.034 --> 10:55.534
Don't touch that either.

10:56.054 --> 10:58.065
So, anything here we can touch?

11:01.242 --> 11:03.868
How come you guys are
using human computers?

11:04.515 --> 11:06.216
It certainly isn't by choice!

11:06.251 --> 11:08.501
It was handed down
from previous tenants

11:08.536 --> 11:11.534
when we inherited
this former missile silo.

11:11.569 --> 11:14.009
I make modifications as I see fit.

11:17.085 --> 11:19.004
I think I can fix that.

11:19.039 --> 11:20.539
Reeally?!

11:20.694 --> 11:24.899
You know this is complex
technology, don't you?

11:24.934 --> 11:27.432
I mean it isn't a child's toy.

11:27.467 --> 11:28.967
Now try.

11:49.003 --> 11:51.063
Maximum overdrive!

12:29.891 --> 12:31.391
Quite an operation!

12:43.524 --> 12:45.403
Blood of Unicron...

12:45.438 --> 12:48.418
How might I fathom the depths
of your mystery,

12:48.453 --> 12:52.159
become worthy of wielding
your astonishing power?

12:52.754 --> 12:56.262
Lord Megatron! Intruders
have been detected in the mines!

12:56.297 --> 12:57.797
Optimus?

12:58.018 --> 12:59.518
Indeed.

13:00.012 --> 13:01.590
I need more time to prepare an

13:01.625 --> 13:04.843
appropriate reception
for my old friend.

13:05.238 --> 13:06.841
Ready the ship for departure!

13:06.876 --> 13:10.854
But the energon I've mined...
the Autobots will seize it!

13:10.889 --> 13:13.526
Then blow the mines!

13:22.411 --> 13:24.292
It's Cliff! I have a visual.

13:24.327 --> 13:26.052
We'll cover you! Go!

13:51.642 --> 13:53.142
Cliff!

13:53.693 --> 13:55.193
No!

14:01.265 --> 14:03.094
Let's get you home, partner!

14:24.778 --> 14:26.278
Prime.

14:28.140 --> 14:31.890
I'd stick around but I'm squeamish.

14:44.283 --> 14:45.797
The joint's gonna blow!

14:46.215 --> 14:48.758
Autobots, roll out!

15:07.379 --> 15:09.540
Ratchet! Bridge us back!

15:09.575 --> 15:12.319
Use the arrival coordinates... Now!

15:28.068 --> 15:29.925
Cutting it a bit close.

15:29.960 --> 15:31.486
How about Cliffjumper?

15:34.837 --> 15:37.161
What was that explosion?

15:37.196 --> 15:38.785
Was there a fight?
Can we come with next time?

15:40.044 --> 15:41.802
- Look!
- He-hey, Miko,

15:41.837 --> 15:44.576
let's go see what the bots
hiding in their sock drawers.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.111
Seriously?

15:46.321 --> 15:48.529
Arcee, what did you see?

15:49.833 --> 15:53.267
Not Cliff. At least...

15:53.800 --> 15:55.300
Not any more.

15:55.683 --> 15:56.584
He was mutated...

15:56.585 --> 16:00.295
Butchered, like something from those
'Con experiments during the war.

16:00.975 --> 16:02.475
No.

16:03.720 --> 16:06.393
I'm fine! Just dizzy.

16:06.428 --> 16:08.274
Robots who get dizzy?

16:08.797 --> 16:13.666
- Robots with emotions.
- Robots... who can die?

16:19.666 --> 16:21.278
What is this??

16:23.848 --> 16:26.366
Don't know. Cliff was covered in it.

16:26.706 --> 16:28.206
Leaking it.

16:30.214 --> 16:32.934
Go take a decontamination bath. Now!

16:35.358 --> 16:37.576
O-Optimus. I-I hate to bug, but...

16:37.611 --> 16:40.430
- No bars.
- A security precaution.

16:40.465 --> 16:43.751
The silo walls isolate all radiowaves.

16:43.938 --> 16:46.049
Well, if I don't call my mom like

16:46.084 --> 16:48.385
now I'm pretty sure
cops will be out looking for me.

16:48.405 --> 16:50.435
Have you broken a law?

16:51.042 --> 16:53.605
A... curfew. It's after ten p.m.

16:53.640 --> 16:55.387
I better get home too,

16:55.422 --> 16:57.443
or I'll be grounded for a year.

16:57.834 --> 16:59.334
Earth customs.

16:59.594 --> 17:01.316
I hadn't considered.

17:01.755 --> 17:04.463
But the issue of your safety remains.

17:04.970 --> 17:07.911
Bulkhead! Accompany Miko home.

17:07.945 --> 17:10.349
Awesome! My host parents will freak!

17:10.385 --> 17:12.682
And maintain covert surveillance

17:12.717 --> 17:14.361
in vehicle form.

17:14.396 --> 17:16.499
Curbside duty, got it.

17:18.996 --> 17:21.712
Bumblebee! You'll watch over Raf.

17:24.492 --> 17:26.065
- Ratchet!
- Busy!

17:26.787 --> 17:29.648
Arcee. You'll accompany Jack.

17:31.490 --> 17:33.291
Ooh, still dizzy.

17:33.326 --> 17:35.469
You're fine! Says your physician.

17:43.338 --> 17:45.273
Arcee, I just wanted to say,

17:45.949 --> 17:48.171
I'm really sorry for your loss.

17:48.474 --> 17:50.511
What could you
possibly know about loss?

17:50.546 --> 17:52.566
What, you think you're
the only one with problems?!

17:54.176 --> 17:56.137
I'm not sure girl trouble counts.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.606
I'm pretty sure my girl

17:58.606 --> 18:00.106
trouble started the night I met you.

18:02.585 --> 18:05.022
- 'Cons!
- No! Mom!

18:07.939 --> 18:09.689
- Jack?
- Mom!

18:10.382 --> 18:13.229
- Don't freak, I can explain!
- Can you?

18:14.850 --> 18:16.852
Jackson Darby,
we've talked about this.

18:16.887 --> 18:19.214
- I know, and...
- You don't know!

18:19.429 --> 18:21.446
I worry about you enough
when you're not here,

18:21.481 --> 18:23.797
now I have to worry about you
driving a motorcycle?

18:23.832 --> 18:27.125
I'm sixteen, I can't
be riding a ten-speed forever!

18:27.597 --> 18:29.334
How did you even afford this?

18:29.982 --> 18:31.230
It's used!

18:31.231 --> 18:33.348
It's abused, really.

18:33.383 --> 18:35.232
Needs a ton of repairs,

18:35.507 --> 18:37.007
but the point is...

18:37.697 --> 18:39.958
I may have been a kid
when I bought this,

18:40.579 --> 18:42.381
but I'm not anymore.

18:42.548 --> 18:44.779
You always tell me
to make responsible choices...

18:45.072 --> 18:46.863
Well, I chose her.

18:47.924 --> 18:49.384
And I'll be responsible!

18:49.385 --> 18:50.885
I promise.

18:51.367 --> 18:52.580
Her?

18:52.581 --> 18:55.269
I didn't think you'll
be bringing girls home just yet.

18:55.689 --> 18:58.566
I... like to think she brought me.

19:00.323 --> 19:02.726
Well, I'm glad you finally
have a reason to wear your helmet

19:02.761 --> 19:05.063
every single time you ride.

19:06.138 --> 19:09.594
You will take me for
a spin every once in a while?

19:11.021 --> 19:12.521
We'll see.

19:12.712 --> 19:15.191
She is kinda temperamental.

19:25.102 --> 19:27.471
Shh! Are you crazy?!
You'll wake up my mom!

19:27.506 --> 19:29.203
Grab your helmet, it's go time.

19:29.984 --> 19:31.345
It's saturday!

19:31.346 --> 19:34.028
You can watch cartoons
back at base with Bumblebee..

19:34.754 --> 19:36.806
Cartoons! I'm sixteen!

19:37.368 --> 19:39.708
And leave a note for your mom!
She worries!

19:40.947 --> 19:42.322
I don't think you need to worry

19:42.323 --> 19:45.921
about further Autobot
interference, Master.

19:46.392 --> 19:48.866
Not with Optimus gone.

19:48.901 --> 19:51.760
And what evidence do
you posses of this fact?

19:52.141 --> 19:55.883
I destroyed the mines,
 as you instructed.

19:55.918 --> 19:59.732
Optimus is not so easily destroyed.

19:59.767 --> 20:03.274
We have millenia worth of battles
behind us to prove it!

20:04.624 --> 20:06.927
May be you should take a break, my Lord.

20:06.962 --> 20:10.594
I worry that too much contact
with the Dark Energon

20:10.629 --> 20:12.234
might allow it's properties to...

20:12.269 --> 20:15.088
...adversely affect you.

20:15.590 --> 20:17.439
Or perhaps, Starscream,

20:17.597 --> 20:21.782
I have not permitted
myself contact enough.

20:23.991 --> 20:25.662
Wait! Lord Megatron!

20:25.697 --> 20:28.397
No! Not your Spark chamber!

20:28.432 --> 20:30.713
You do not know what it will do!

20:47.820 --> 20:50.037
Hmm. The base elements of this goo

20:50.072 --> 20:52.215
are like nothing
 I've ever encountered.

20:52.250 --> 20:56.576
Must be extremely concentrated
to have affected Arcee so rapidly.

20:56.930 --> 20:58.418
Unfortunately,

20:58.419 --> 21:01.291
complete results are
slow coming without

21:01.326 --> 21:03.444
the use of proper diagnostic tools!

21:03.479 --> 21:05.910
Thank you very much, Bulkhead!
