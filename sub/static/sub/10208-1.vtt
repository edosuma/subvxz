04:00.157 --> 04:02.910
Amy.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.121
It's Dad.

04:06.371 --> 04:09.041
Dad?

04:09.291 --> 04:12.628
Why are you here?

04:13.712 --> 04:17.716
I came down from Canada.

04:19.176 --> 04:22.763
I've come to take you home.

04:23.555 --> 04:25.474
What do you mean?

04:25.724 --> 04:30.020
- Well, I mean...
- Where's Mum?

04:35.317 --> 04:38.362
Tell me.

04:38.779 --> 04:42.533
Mum died, didn't she?

05:05.347 --> 05:09.643
There was a foot of snow here
when I left.

05:14.106 --> 05:17.901
I apologise for the mess.
I haven't had a...

05:18.151 --> 05:20.779
I haven't had a chance to clean up.

05:21.029 --> 05:24.825
I've been really busy with, you know,
this, that, the other thing.

05:25.075 --> 05:31.415
I haven't done any work to speak of
on the house in nine years.

05:31.665 --> 05:36.128
It'll be really nice
once it's all finished.

05:38.589 --> 05:42.384
Trunk. I'll get the trunk.

05:53.562 --> 05:57.399
Well, the bed looks nice.

05:58.317 --> 06:01.904
I ran out of storage space
in the workshop.

06:02.154 --> 06:04.615
I'll clear the junk out
in the morning.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.910
- Make it just like you remember it.
- I don't.

06:08.160 --> 06:11.038
You don't what?

06:11.288 --> 06:14.291
Remember it.

06:22.758 --> 06:24.843
I'm really tired.

06:25.093 --> 06:27.846
Yeah.

06:35.354 --> 06:38.273
Good night.

10:44.436 --> 10:46.730
You didn't think I could fly, did you?

10:46.980 --> 10:48.482
What did you think?

10:48.732 --> 10:51.568
I wouldn't go and brag about it.

10:51.818 --> 10:57.491
Oh, well, that's actually
a pretty good landing for me.

11:00.202 --> 11:03.080
He's headed to a museum in Montreal.

11:03.330 --> 11:07.459
I was thinking:
a goatee or clean-shaven?

11:07.709 --> 11:11.922
Give him a beard.
Then he'll look like you.

11:15.717 --> 11:18.095
I'm gonna be real busy.

11:18.345 --> 11:23.559
I'm behind.
I gotta deliver him and...

11:24.852 --> 11:27.229
I'm gonna be in the shop a lot.

11:27.479 --> 11:30.232
Okay?

11:30.732 --> 11:35.737
I'm not a baby.
You don't have to hold my hand.

12:31.126 --> 12:34.713
- What's that?
- I won an award for that.

12:34.963 --> 12:38.550
From the Canadian Society
of Inventors. Not bad, eh?

12:38.800 --> 12:43.222
- What is it?
- It's a refrigerator.

12:45.224 --> 12:48.435
Very original.

12:50.687 --> 12:52.940
Moo goo gai in a pan.

12:53.190 --> 12:56.693
It's real easy to make.
It says so right here.

12:56.944 --> 13:00.531
You like peanut butter? Remember,
it had a real peanutty taste?

13:00.781 --> 13:03.951
- I'm not eating that.
- The peanut butter makes it good.

13:04.201 --> 13:07.996
The peanuts, there's
an oil thing that happens.

13:08.247 --> 13:10.582
Why is a spaceship in the barn?

13:10.833 --> 13:13.126
That's the Lunar Lander.

13:13.377 --> 13:17.798
Remember when I built that?
It was the winter...

13:18.048 --> 13:21.176
...you and your mom...

13:21.969 --> 13:23.804
You and your mom left.

13:24.054 --> 13:27.266
Remember, she thought
I was crazy for doing it.

13:27.516 --> 13:31.979
I was too.
I had no money and a busted ankle.

13:32.229 --> 13:35.357
Colder than hell.

13:35.357 --> 13:39.611
But I just couldn't get over
that whole moon trip.

13:39.862 --> 13:43.282
Why did you build it?

13:43.699 --> 13:47.536
The Lunar Lander, think about it.
It's up there right now.

13:47.786 --> 13:51.999
The original one.
They left it there. It's parked.

13:52.249 --> 13:57.754
So we needed another one.
So I made an exact replica.

13:58.005 --> 14:00.883
Yeah. Every home should have one.

14:01.133 --> 14:04.761
I've been offered a lot for that.

14:13.395 --> 14:15.522
Hi.

14:15.772 --> 14:18.901
You must be Amy.
I've heard a lot about you.

14:19.151 --> 14:24.156
Hey, how you doing?
This is Susan, a friend of mine.

14:26.366 --> 14:29.203
This is for you.

14:29.453 --> 14:31.788
It's a welcome...

14:32.039 --> 14:35.417
...gift. Welcome.

14:43.133 --> 14:45.969
Do you live here too?

14:46.762 --> 14:48.931
Well...

14:49.181 --> 14:50.807
Yes, I do.

14:51.058 --> 14:54.520
Sometimes I do.

14:54.770 --> 14:57.940
Excuse me.

15:01.693 --> 15:05.239
So, what's cooking?

15:12.579 --> 15:15.332
So! That went well.

15:19.795 --> 15:22.923
...clearing the corner,
fixing the bed, the flowers...

15:23.173 --> 15:26.593
...and everything.
I mean, it's just great.

15:26.844 --> 15:32.140
- No problem.
- We were really beat when we got back.

15:32.140 --> 15:35.602
She's different
than I thought she'd be.

15:35.853 --> 15:39.439
More complicated.

15:40.691 --> 15:45.279
She used to travel all over
and tour with her mother.

15:45.320 --> 15:48.156
Singing in a club in Tokyo.

15:48.407 --> 15:51.910
A week later, recording in London.

15:52.161 --> 15:55.497
They were on the move a lot.

18:24.646 --> 18:26.565
Get out of here!

18:26.815 --> 18:29.484
What do you think you're doing?

18:29.735 --> 18:34.281
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

18:34.615 --> 18:38.702
We haven't had the meeting yet!
We haven't voted!

18:38.952 --> 18:42.164
You're totally illegal!

18:47.127 --> 18:51.215
I'm gonna get a lawyer
and sue your ass!

19:01.934 --> 19:02.935
Amy.

19:03.185 --> 19:05.604
Amy, look.

19:05.854 --> 19:08.273
I'm sorry about that
but these people...

19:08.524 --> 19:10.567
They want to build this development.

19:10.817 --> 19:14.613
We've been fighting them because
it's going to ruin the community.

19:14.863 --> 19:16.406
I don't care.

19:16.657 --> 19:21.286
Yeah, well, okay. I just wanted
to explain it you. That's all.

19:21.537 --> 19:26.083
I don't care about any of it.
I'm not going back to school anymore.

19:26.333 --> 19:30.337
- I'd rather die than go back there.
- Amy.

19:35.008 --> 19:39.054
Why did all this have to happen?

23:38.210 --> 23:40.629
Who are you?

23:40.879 --> 23:43.465
They were coming at me
through the frozen food section.

23:43.715 --> 23:49.721
It was just truly awful.
Their lips were so blue.

23:50.889 --> 23:53.892
- Oh, wow! You gotta be Amy.
- Yeah.

23:54.142 --> 23:58.605
I gave you Silly Putty
for Christmas once. You ate it.

23:58.856 --> 24:00.190
You remember, Tom?

24:00.440 --> 24:03.652
She took a bite of a slipper once.
Swallowed it.

24:03.902 --> 24:05.320
What's he doing here?

24:05.571 --> 24:08.240
He's your uncle.
He's helping me catch up.

24:08.490 --> 24:10.951
Tom uses me as his beast of burden.

24:11.201 --> 24:15.372
I lug pig iron for Michelangelo.

24:15.622 --> 24:17.332
- That's the bus.
- Dad, no.

24:17.583 --> 24:20.502
- Books, shoes, hat, bag.
- No, no, Dad.

24:20.752 --> 24:22.462
- Where's your bag?
- Wait, listen...

24:22.713 --> 24:24.089
David's got the bag.

24:24.339 --> 24:25.966
- Homework!
- Dad, I've got...

24:26.216 --> 24:28.427
- We're coming. We're coming!
- Dad!

24:28.677 --> 24:30.470
- Okay, go.
- Just wait a minute.

24:30.721 --> 24:35.017
You're going to school. You belong
in school, every day. Period. Go!

24:35.267 --> 24:38.187
- Go, go, go, go.
- Oh, Dad!

24:38.437 --> 24:41.732
Today, I want to move on
to another important figure:

24:41.982 --> 24:44.902
Sir Allan Napier McNab.

24:45.152 --> 24:46.987
Sir Allan was elected...

24:47.237 --> 24:50.365
...to the Upper Canada
Legislative Assembly...

24:50.616 --> 24:53.076
...in 1830.

24:53.327 --> 24:54.745
He was its speaker...

24:54.995 --> 24:58.874
...from 1837 to 1840...

24:59.124 --> 25:02.586
...while the Tories
were in the majority.

25:02.836 --> 25:05.047
<i>And he was the Prime Minister...</i>

25:05.297 --> 25:07.591
<i>... of the United Colony...</i>

25:07.841 --> 25:14.806
<i>... from 1854 until 1856...</i>

25:40.791 --> 25:42.501
Amy!

25:42.751 --> 25:43.752
Hi.

25:44.002 --> 25:46.255
Hey. How'd it go today?

25:46.505 --> 25:48.966
- Quite awful, thank you.
- Sorry to hear that.

25:49.216 --> 25:51.426
It'll be better tomorrow, I'm sure.

25:51.677 --> 25:54.012
Susan and I are going to a meeting.

25:54.263 --> 25:56.390
Uncle Dave is gonna stay
and feed you...

25:56.640 --> 26:00.185
...help you with your homework.
Math tonight, right?

26:00.435 --> 26:02.479
- We'll be home by 10.
- Don't worry.

26:02.729 --> 26:04.398
Be in bed by 8:30!

26:04.648 --> 26:07.234
What, decimals? Fractions?

26:07.484 --> 26:11.530
Math can be really fun.
It really can.

26:49.484 --> 26:52.821
Call him on that!

28:02.140 --> 28:05.769
By destroying the marsh, they've
accomplished their objective...

28:06.019 --> 28:08.438
...which is, there's
nothing left to save.

28:08.689 --> 28:10.607
It's a done deal.

28:10.858 --> 28:13.443
And it's an outrage!

28:13.694 --> 28:15.320
There are laws against this.

28:15.571 --> 28:20.409
I want to know who amongst you
is going to enforce them?

28:21.034 --> 28:24.454
The Chair recognises Sam Tufts.

28:24.705 --> 28:26.540
Sir...

28:26.790 --> 28:31.253
...I'm proud to be one
of the "they" you speak of.

28:31.503 --> 28:34.715
As a farmer, I don't have
the luxury of an outside income.

28:34.965 --> 28:38.719
My land is part of the package
because I can't make a living off it.

28:38.969 --> 28:41.763
If I don't sell, how will I
send my kids to college?

28:42.014 --> 28:44.308
The Chair recognises Glenn Seiferts.

28:44.558 --> 28:47.644
I'd like to say it's not
this project that worries me...

28:47.895 --> 28:50.731
...as much as the ones
that'll follow in its wake.

28:50.981 --> 28:53.942
I don't believe many of you
want this to happen.

28:54.193 --> 28:58.614
I wish you'd consider the fields
and streams your children play in.

28:58.864 --> 29:01.950
The clean air, the clean water...

29:02.201 --> 29:06.455
...the general peace of mind.
And let's not forget the animals.

29:06.705 --> 29:12.169
They're on the brink of leaving here
forever if this permit is passed...

29:12.419 --> 29:15.255
<i>... so think about it.</i>

29:18.634 --> 29:21.762
- But you tried!
- I have enough to deal with.

29:22.012 --> 29:25.474
- I've got enough on my...
- Shh!

29:27.267 --> 29:30.479
Hey. How you doing?

29:30.729 --> 29:34.024
What time did she go to sleep?

29:36.902 --> 29:40.864
What time did she go to sleep?

29:41.114 --> 29:44.284
Amy!

29:44.535 --> 29:47.996
Amy!

29:53.794 --> 29:57.798
I don't even remember falling asleep.

30:26.577 --> 30:30.497
Well, now we know why
she was going to the marsh.

30:30.747 --> 30:36.628
- Is it okay for her to sleep here?
- Oh, yeah. She'll be okay.

30:56.190 --> 31:00.986
Can I keep them? Please?

31:05.949 --> 31:08.952
Hi, guys.

31:35.187 --> 31:38.065
Good morning.

31:40.359 --> 31:43.070
You've got to feed them
every two hours.

31:43.320 --> 31:44.321
Okay.

31:44.571 --> 31:46.782
And they need a lot of attention.

31:47.032 --> 31:49.535
What they need is to learn
where to poop.

31:49.785 --> 31:52.788
Come on, they're just babies.

31:53.038 --> 31:56.542
Look, they're not going to be able
to stay in the house.

31:56.792 --> 32:01.004
If you put them outside, owls and cats
will get them. And they'll die!

32:01.255 --> 32:05.300
- There's your bus. You've gotta go.
- Are you sure you can handle this?

32:05.551 --> 32:07.678
Yes, I'm sure. Okay?

32:07.928 --> 32:11.890
Go to school. Go. Now!

32:27.865 --> 32:30.492
I hear they postponed
building for a year.

32:30.742 --> 32:33.245
Who knows? I don't believe it.

32:33.495 --> 32:36.707
My daughter found some goose eggs
in that mess.

32:36.957 --> 32:40.878
They wiped out some birds
when they went through there.

32:41.128 --> 32:46.508
They hatched, now I've got fuzzballs
in my house. I don't know what to do.

32:46.758 --> 32:50.971
- Wild geese, yeah.
- Yeah.

32:51.805 --> 32:55.475
That was one of the last nesting
places for them in the area.

32:55.726 --> 32:59.897
- You just inherited more problems.
- Great.

33:00.147 --> 33:02.357
Geese learn from their parents.

33:02.608 --> 33:06.653
Everything from what to eat,
how to fly, when to migrate.

33:06.904 --> 33:08.155
When do they migrate?

33:08.405 --> 33:12.409
Late fall. But without
the parental influence...

33:12.659 --> 33:16.663
...they'll get the urge to fly,
but won't know where they're going.

33:16.914 --> 33:21.543
- How do I take care of them?
- A little grass and grain for now.

33:21.793 --> 33:26.256
I'll come by in a couple days and see
what you got, and if I can help.

33:26.507 --> 33:29.885
- That would be great.
- Good.

33:45.192 --> 33:50.405
Hey, hey. Come on, goose.
Hey, goose.

34:26.692 --> 34:30.946
- How old is she?
- Thirteen.

34:31.196 --> 34:33.532
They grow up quick, don't they?

34:33.782 --> 34:35.284
I wouldn't know.

34:35.534 --> 34:38.745
It's amazing how they follow her
around like that.

34:38.996 --> 34:41.665
Yeah. It's called "imprinting".

34:41.915 --> 34:46.879
The first living thing a goose sees
it assumes is its mother.

34:47.129 --> 34:50.465
They'll follow her anywhere.

35:04.688 --> 35:09.276
It's important to note
that geese are tough birds.

35:09.526 --> 35:12.946
The way they've been displaced,
I'm amazed they're not extinct.

35:13.197 --> 35:15.199
But they've learned to adapt.

35:15.449 --> 35:17.743
Where do they go?

35:17.993 --> 35:21.914
That's the problem.
I get calls all the time.

35:22.164 --> 35:26.502
They land on people's front lawns,
the golf course...

35:26.752 --> 35:29.296
That's why we have Ordinance 9314.

35:29.546 --> 35:30.797
Ordinance what?

35:31.048 --> 35:33.342
Ordinance 9314:

35:33.592 --> 35:38.639
"All domestically raised geese
have to be rendered flightless."

35:38.805 --> 35:42.601
It's better known as "pinioning".

35:42.893 --> 35:46.730
It's actually a simple procedure.

35:46.980 --> 35:48.398
It's quite painless.

35:48.649 --> 35:51.318
What do we have here?
Come here, guy.

35:51.568 --> 35:53.153
Please leave him alone.

35:53.403 --> 35:57.157
Your name's Amy, right?
Amy, these geese belong to the Crown.

35:57.407 --> 35:59.451
- What Crown?
- Queen of England.

35:59.701 --> 36:02.955
- Pinioning?
- I had no idea.

36:03.205 --> 36:05.999
It's for the good of the goose
and the people.

36:06.250 --> 36:10.295
You take the wing and just shave
a bit off the cuticle here.

36:10.546 --> 36:15.008
What are you doing?! Stop it!
Stop it!

36:15.801 --> 36:19.304
What the hell are you doing?

36:19.638 --> 36:21.974
- Watch out!
- Easy.

36:22.224 --> 36:25.310
What are you doing?

36:25.310 --> 36:27.771
What the hell are you doing?

36:28.021 --> 36:30.691
What's wrong? I'm trying to help.

36:30.941 --> 36:35.112
What happens when they start to fly?
What happens when they migrate?

36:35.362 --> 36:37.948
They'll be zapped in power lines.

36:38.198 --> 36:40.325
- Get off my land!
- Listen!

36:40.576 --> 36:43.620
They could be carrying parasites
and disease...

36:43.871 --> 36:46.039
Stay off of my place!

36:46.290 --> 36:49.626
They'll be clipped, no matter what!

36:53.714 --> 36:58.510
If they fly, I'll confiscate them.

37:01.096 --> 37:03.724
Amy.

37:04.266 --> 37:08.937
Amy, I'm sorry. I didn't know
he was going to do that.

37:09.188 --> 37:16.153
I promise I won't let anybody
hurt them, all right? Open the door.

37:48.435 --> 37:53.649
She's your daughter.
You have to figure it out yourself.

37:55.984 --> 38:00.572
I've tried everything.
I've been nice to her.

38:00.823 --> 38:05.035
I've been tough on her.
Nothing's worked.

38:08.372 --> 38:11.667
I think the bottom line is...

38:11.917 --> 38:14.920
...that she doesn't want to be here.

38:15.170 --> 38:19.383
And I'm no better father now
than I was when she was 3.

38:19.633 --> 38:24.221
- At least you're here.
- Yeah, I'm here.

38:32.563 --> 38:35.482
It's okay.

38:39.319 --> 38:41.572
Thomas!

38:41.822 --> 38:45.075
Hey, Barry!

38:45.868 --> 38:47.161
How you doing?

38:47.411 --> 38:48.871
Good.

38:49.121 --> 38:52.082
- I got those battens for you.
- Thank you.

38:52.332 --> 38:54.293
You've missed some good flying.

38:54.543 --> 38:57.921
I got this straight-up elevator
off a cliff burble...

38:58.172 --> 39:02.009
...I must have gone up 2000 feet
in a minute.

39:02.259 --> 39:04.011
Where is this place?

39:04.261 --> 39:06.513
It's 52 miles.
I got my bird in the truck.

39:06.763 --> 39:11.852
I can't.
I got a bit of a crisis here.

39:12.102 --> 39:16.356
- You want some coffee?
- Yeah, sure.

39:44.927 --> 39:47.846
Amy!

40:04.905 --> 40:06.073
Get out!

40:06.323 --> 40:10.369
It's the compressor! I just...

40:11.745 --> 40:15.541
- It's the compressor!
- Get out!

40:15.791 --> 40:20.546
- Get out!
- It's the compressor!

40:29.596 --> 40:31.723
- He's so weird!
- You're right, he is.

40:31.974 --> 40:35.769
I miss my friends and my room.
Who was that guy?

40:36.019 --> 40:37.813
Just a guy. He didn't see you.

40:38.063 --> 40:39.940
- He did too!
- No, he didn't.

40:40.190 --> 40:42.025
- He did.
- No.

40:42.276 --> 40:45.154
Why did he bring
a man to chop their wings off?

40:45.404 --> 40:47.322
Your father didn't know.

40:47.573 --> 40:50.784
- He did, and he's coming back.
- No, he's not.

40:51.034 --> 40:54.955
- Amy, listen to me. Listen to me!
- No! No!

40:55.205 --> 40:58.584
I know I can't replace your mother.
Nobody can.

40:58.834 --> 41:02.421
But if you let me,
I can be your friend.

41:02.671 --> 41:07.384
The first rule of friends is
they have to trust each other.

41:07.634 --> 41:12.431
I promise you, nothing is going
to happen to those geese. Nothing.

41:12.681 --> 41:18.312
I won't let it, and neither
will your dad. It's a promise.

41:18.562 --> 41:21.690
Okay?

42:10.030 --> 42:12.074
- See that weld?
- I see your finger.

42:12.324 --> 42:15.118
- It's dark!
- No, it's behind there. The weld.

42:15.369 --> 42:17.955
I got it.

43:12.551 --> 43:16.180
How fast do they fly again?

43:17.055 --> 43:20.684
- Thirty-one miles an hour.
- Oh, God, there's no way!

43:20.934 --> 43:22.019
Yeah, it's slow.

43:22.269 --> 43:26.315
- Makes for a really slow aeroplane.
- They're aerodynamically perfect.

43:26.565 --> 43:30.277
What's that principle?
The guy that...

43:30.527 --> 43:32.821
- Bernoulli.
- Bernoulli.

43:33.071 --> 43:38.452
If the wing is curved, airflow moves
faster over the top. It goes farther.

43:38.702 --> 43:41.997
Less pressure on top,
ergo lift...

43:42.247 --> 43:44.416
...ergo flight.

43:44.666 --> 43:47.127
Ergo...

43:47.377 --> 43:50.380
Ergo what?

43:59.056 --> 44:01.266
Have you turned the gas on, Tom?

44:01.517 --> 44:03.644
Yeah, now it's on.

44:03.894 --> 44:05.646
Turn it off.

44:05.896 --> 44:08.941
Make up your mind.

44:09.066 --> 44:12.361
Turn it off until the engine starts.

44:12.611 --> 44:15.405
Then turn it back on.

44:20.160 --> 44:23.622
This is the kill switch. Clamp it
in your teeth. If you crash...

44:23.872 --> 44:28.418
...your jaw relaxes.
You won't get cut up too bad.

44:28.669 --> 44:32.714
- Fly on, boys!
- Everybody clear?

45:07.457 --> 45:11.295
- We need a bigger engine.
- Yeah.

45:18.802 --> 45:20.137
Wake up.

45:20.387 --> 45:23.390
Hey, hey.

45:27.227 --> 45:29.563
Hey, guys.

45:29.813 --> 45:32.774
Hey, guys, come on.

45:38.280 --> 45:42.784
Hey, geese, come on!
Come on, geese! Come on, geese!

45:57.758 --> 46:00.427
Come on.

46:00.677 --> 46:02.888
You could fly real high with this.

46:03.138 --> 46:05.224
Or end up a pile of ground round.

46:05.474 --> 46:09.686
There's only one way to find out.

46:25.911 --> 46:29.706
Come on, Tom. Come on!

46:41.927 --> 46:45.138
Oh, God!

46:47.641 --> 46:50.644
Oh, my. What a ride!

46:50.894 --> 46:53.522
My feet can't take this anymore.

46:53.772 --> 46:56.024
- See that one?
- This one?

46:56.275 --> 46:57.776
That one's Fluffy.

46:58.026 --> 47:01.446
- And that one's Featherbrain.
- Featherbrain?

47:01.697 --> 47:05.117
And that's Grumpy. He likes mud.

47:05.367 --> 47:06.702
What's that little guy's name?

47:06.952 --> 47:10.789
This one? I haven't thought
of a name yet.

47:11.039 --> 47:16.253
He was born with a limp,
so maybe I'll call him Gimpy.

47:16.503 --> 47:20.966
That's pretty good.
It might give him a complex, though.

47:21.216 --> 47:24.511
You might think of something
more strong.

47:24.761 --> 47:28.765
Like John, or Thor.

47:29.016 --> 47:32.644
Mac, or something.
Oh, I got it. Igor!

47:32.895 --> 47:33.979
- Igor?
- Yeah.

47:34.229 --> 47:37.316
Like in "Frankenstein":

47:37.566 --> 47:41.403
"Master. Master, follow me!"
You know?

47:41.653 --> 47:44.072
That's good. I like it. "Igor".

47:44.323 --> 47:47.451
"It's alive!" You know.

48:45.968 --> 48:48.220
I had this idea...

48:48.470 --> 48:50.931
...about the geese.

48:51.181 --> 48:55.310
I've been watching the way
they've been following you.

48:55.561 --> 48:57.229
Even when you're
on your four-wheeler.

48:57.479 --> 49:02.609
It occurred to me that they just might
follow my aeroplane too.

49:02.860 --> 49:04.903
- No way.
- Amy, look.

49:05.154 --> 49:07.948
They're gonna try to fly away.
That's what they do.

49:08.198 --> 49:09.199
They're migratory.

49:09.449 --> 49:13.162
They go south in the winter, just as
their ancestors have always done.

49:13.412 --> 49:14.913
So?

49:15.164 --> 49:17.457
We can keep them in the barn.

49:17.708 --> 49:22.504
Sure, we could do that.
It's kind of like jail.

49:22.963 --> 49:26.258
We could also clip their wings.

49:26.633 --> 49:27.801
Doesn't matter.

49:28.051 --> 49:32.431
They'll want to go south, where
it's warm and there's plenty to eat.

49:32.681 --> 49:38.312
I could show them the way
by flying with them in my plane.

49:38.562 --> 49:42.232
My geese won't have anything to do
with your crazy ideas.

49:42.483 --> 49:46.403
She's right, Thomas.
This one is way out there.

49:46.653 --> 49:49.156
Okay, look. But this could work.

49:49.406 --> 49:51.033
According to the books...

49:51.283 --> 49:54.870
...they learn the landscape
by following their parents.

49:55.120 --> 49:58.332
In the spring, they come back
by the same route...

49:58.582 --> 50:00.876
...exactly, to the same place.

50:01.126 --> 50:03.295
Right there on the front porch.

50:03.545 --> 50:06.006
Our problem is that your birds...

50:06.256 --> 50:09.134
...don't have anybody
to show them the way.

50:09.384 --> 50:14.681
So they'll take off and get lost,
or get shot by hunters, or worse.

50:14.932 --> 50:17.893
They're not gonna follow you.

50:23.899 --> 50:27.444
But they might if you help me.

50:29.655 --> 50:31.573
Believe me, this could work.

50:31.824 --> 50:35.577
I promise you, it'll be okay.

50:40.457 --> 50:43.210
I promise.

51:43.270 --> 51:46.690
Come on, guys. Come on.

53:05.435 --> 53:09.690
<i>That was close.
We'll get it.</i>

53:28.000 --> 53:31.587
Hey, guys! Come on!

54:14.963 --> 54:20.010
It seemed so perfect. I'm used to
my ideas not working out at first.

54:20.260 --> 54:23.138
Yeah, but she's not used to it.

54:23.388 --> 54:28.477
You got her all excited about this.
Now she feels like you let her down...

54:28.727 --> 54:31.647
...again.

54:37.069 --> 54:40.364
Broken promises are the worst.
It's better not to promise.

54:40.614 --> 54:47.287
I'm having trouble figuring it out.
I didn't say I was giving up...

55:13.438 --> 55:16.483
Amy!

55:18.944 --> 55:21.905
Amy!

55:37.171 --> 55:41.008
Oh, God. Amy, please.

55:43.177 --> 55:46.847
Talk to me. Talk to me, Amy.

55:47.097 --> 55:50.893
- Hi.
- Oh, God!

55:53.187 --> 55:55.606
Oh, sweetie. Are you hurt?

55:55.856 --> 55:59.026
I don't think so.

56:00.986 --> 56:04.072
You're crying.

56:04.156 --> 56:07.993
Yeah, I thought you were...

56:31.266 --> 56:34.853
<i>Suppose I built another aircraft.</i>

56:35.103 --> 56:39.274
And then taught Amy how to fly it.

56:40.734 --> 56:42.277
What?

56:42.528 --> 56:47.366
Look, the birds will fly with her,
she'll fly with me.

56:47.616 --> 56:49.076
I could lead them all south.

56:49.326 --> 56:52.621
You're joking, right?

56:53.497 --> 56:57.501
She nearly broke her neck yesterday.
This is a joke, right?

56:57.751 --> 56:59.711
No, it's not.

56:59.962 --> 57:02.923
It's a great idea.
We can make it work.

57:03.173 --> 57:06.552
The birds follow me, I follow you.
We all go south.

57:06.802 --> 57:08.929
It's brilliant.

57:09.179 --> 57:11.515
I knew you could think of something.

57:11.765 --> 57:16.395
It's the most stupid, irresponsible,
harebrained scheme I've ever heard...

57:16.645 --> 57:20.482
It's the only way they'll fly
with her. That's the way it works.

57:20.732 --> 57:22.234
What is wrong with you?

57:22.484 --> 57:26.113
- I thought you liked the geese.
- I do like the geese!

57:26.363 --> 57:30.242
It's a lot more dangerous for her
to drive on the expressway.

57:30.492 --> 57:33.287
It's the safest ultralight out there.

57:33.537 --> 57:36.331
- It has to be safe as possible.
- But it's pricey.

57:36.582 --> 57:41.044
I don't care about that. It has to be
simple to fly and gentle to put down.

57:41.295 --> 57:44.965
Well, yeah, it'll fly
at 28, 29 miles an hour.

57:45.215 --> 57:49.178
- Really?
- Or even climb at that.

57:57.436 --> 58:00.606
There you go, fellas. Enjoy it.

58:00.856 --> 58:04.526
Thank you very much. Take it easy.

58:18.499 --> 58:20.959
Turn to the right.
Lean. Lean to the right.

58:21.210 --> 58:25.589
Push far to the left. That's it.

58:26.798 --> 58:30.052
Remember, you've got 34 feet
of wing tip up here.

58:30.302 --> 58:32.846
It's kind of like having
real wide hips.

58:33.096 --> 58:35.933
All right, let's make a hard right.
Hard right.

58:36.183 --> 58:38.685
Good leans, like you're flying.
Good girl.

58:38.936 --> 58:43.190
Keep the bar pushed down.
Really bringing it around.

58:43.440 --> 58:47.611
You got it. I'm not doing anything.
It's all you, Amy.

58:47.861 --> 58:50.572
Beautiful! Good leaning.

58:50.823 --> 58:55.160
Go hard to the right, just like
we're flying. Now, swing to the left.

58:55.410 --> 58:58.997
Lean it, lean it, lean it!
There you go!

58:59.248 --> 59:02.167
Beautiful!

59:02.709 --> 59:04.962
Nice and straight. Bar centred.

59:05.212 --> 59:09.842
Nice and easy, eyes straight ahead.
Hold on to the bar, Amy.

59:10.092 --> 59:13.220
Smooth. Push out on the bar.
And up we go!

59:13.470 --> 59:17.891
Thattagirl! Thattagirl!
You're doing it.

59:18.141 --> 59:19.893
You're doing it, Ames!

59:20.144 --> 59:26.692
Get the bar, right about there.
Get it up there. You got it!

59:44.001 --> 59:46.712
I've been around
a lot of flyers in my time.

59:46.962 --> 59:49.840
- I think you're a natural.
- Do you really think so?

59:50.090 --> 59:53.635
Some people are, when it comes
to flying. You're one of them.

59:53.886 --> 59:56.555
The wind is coming
from right straight at us.

59:56.805 --> 01:00:00.184
So it'll go right under the plane.
It's gonna be perfect.

01:00:00.434 --> 01:00:03.228
- The plane's gonna be a lot lighter.
- I know, Dad.

01:00:03.479 --> 01:00:05.606
Your takeoff roll will be shorter.

01:00:05.856 --> 01:00:10.944
You'll climb real fast. But still,
do the smooth push-out with the bar.

01:00:11.195 --> 01:00:15.365
Now, I'm coming up right behind you.
Just make passes around the field.

01:00:15.616 --> 01:00:18.452
If your engine cuts out,
glide down onto the field.

01:00:18.702 --> 01:00:20.829
Don't go anywhere except the field.

01:00:21.079 --> 01:00:25.083
- Yeah, I know.
- You're gonna do good.

01:00:25.292 --> 01:00:28.128
Lift prop.

01:00:29.305 --> 01:00:35.238
