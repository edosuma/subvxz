01:13.552 --> 01:15.324
FEED IN THE PARAMETERS

01:15.325 --> 01:18.066
FOR THE NEGATIVE
MAGNETIC FLUX.

01:18.067 --> 01:20.206
IT'S BARELY DAWN.

01:20.207 --> 01:21.644
MUST WE GET UP
SO EARLY

01:21.645 --> 01:23.751
JUST TO PROGRAM
A COMPUTER?

01:23.752 --> 01:25.289
YES, SHREDDER.

01:25.290 --> 01:30.706
WHILE OUR ENEMIES SLEEP,
WE ARE WAKIES, ALERT, AND--

01:37.128 --> 01:40.940
WAKE UP,
YOU SLIME BUCKETS!

01:40.941 --> 01:43.247
OHH, MOMMY...

01:43.248 --> 01:45.421
DO I HAVE TO GO
TO SCHOOL?

01:45.422 --> 01:48.028
AND GET OFF MY BUTTONS!

01:49.267 --> 01:51.774
WHAT IS
HAPPENING?

01:51.775 --> 01:54.048
MY INSTRUMENTS
HAVE DETECTED

01:54.049 --> 01:57.760
THE EXISTENCE OF
AN ALIEN METAL
ON THE SURFACE,

01:57.761 --> 02:01.405
ONE THAT
WILL HELP ME
CONQUER THE EARTH.

02:01.406 --> 02:06.221
HERE. TAKE THIS
ALIEN METAL DETECTOR
TO THE SURFACE,

02:06.222 --> 02:07.927
AND FIND IT.

02:07.928 --> 02:09.933
OH, JEEZ!

02:09.934 --> 02:12.340
ANOTHER TRIP
TO THE SURFACE?

02:12.341 --> 02:13.511
AND TO THINK,

02:13.512 --> 02:16.420
I DIDN'T BECOME
A PROFESSIONAL PERSON

02:16.421 --> 02:18.260
'CAUSE I HATE COMMUTING.

02:26.387 --> 02:28.124
YEAH. Y'KNOW,
MORNINGS WOULD BE
A LOT BETTER

02:28.125 --> 02:29.395
IF THEY HAPPENED
AT NOON.

02:29.396 --> 02:32.305
OH, FOR SURE, DUDE.

02:32.306 --> 02:35.649
AHH. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL,
GORGEOUS NEW DAY, GUYS.

02:35.650 --> 02:38.190
RISE AND SHINE.

02:39.328 --> 02:42.337
MAKE THAT "RISE
WITH A SHINER."

02:45.180 --> 02:46.851
<i>ALL RIGHT, AMIGOS.</i>

02:46.852 --> 02:49.092
BREAKFAST IS READY.

02:49.093 --> 02:53.038
DEEP-DISH OATMEAL PIZZA
WITH GRAPEFRUIT TOPPING!

02:53.039 --> 02:54.643
THAT'S THE TROUBLE
WITH BREAKFAST.

02:54.644 --> 02:56.282
ALWAYS
THE SAME OLD THING.

02:56.283 --> 02:59.124
HEY, DONATELLO,
CHOW TIME.

02:59.125 --> 03:01.766
HOW CAN YOU GUYS
THINK ABOUT FOOD?

03:01.767 --> 03:03.204
DON'T YOU KNOW
WHAT DAY IT IS?

03:03.205 --> 03:05.846
UH, NOT-THINKING-
ABOUT-FOOD DAY?

03:05.847 --> 03:09.324
<i>IT'S NATIONAL SENSEI
APPRECIATION DAY.</i>

03:09.325 --> 03:11.263
WOW, THEY SURE DO
SNEAK UP ON YOU.

03:11.264 --> 03:13.470
WE GOTTA GET
MASTER SPLINTER
A PRESENT.

03:13.471 --> 03:15.143
LIKE WHAT?

03:15.144 --> 03:17.951
THAT DEPENDS ON
HOW MUCH WE'VE GOT
IN THE BANK.

03:21.497 --> 03:23.335
OK.

03:23.336 --> 03:26.880
WHO PUT
THE SUN-DRIED TOMATOES
IN THE TURTLE BANK?

03:26.881 --> 03:30.559
HEY, DUDES,
JUST SAVING
FOR A RAINY DAY.

03:35.041 --> 03:37.280
YOU KNOW,
I ADMIRE A MAN

03:37.281 --> 03:39.788
WHO'S BIG ENOUGH
TO ADMIT HE'S MADE
A MISTAKE.

03:39.789 --> 03:42.296
MAYBE WE COULD
TALK ABOUT IT
OVER DINNER.

03:42.297 --> 03:43.801
H-HELLO?

03:43.802 --> 03:44.804
HELLO?

03:44.805 --> 03:46.811
NEW BOYFRIEND?

03:46.812 --> 03:49.553
NO, WRONG NUMBER.

03:49.554 --> 03:50.924
WHAT CAN I DO,
BURNE?

03:50.925 --> 03:53.633
THERE'S
JUST NOTHING
HAPPENING TODAY.

03:53.634 --> 03:55.773
VERNON, YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY SAY--

03:55.774 --> 03:57.646
"DOG BITES MAN"
IS NOTHING.

03:57.647 --> 04:00.288
BUT "MAN BITES DOG"
IS NEWS.

04:00.289 --> 04:01.457
SO?

04:01.458 --> 04:04.133
SO, GO BITE A DOG!

04:06.676 --> 04:09.015
SURE, GO BITE A DOG.

04:09.016 --> 04:11.356
WHAT DO I LOOK LIKE,
A FLEA?

04:11.357 --> 04:14.031
NO, IRMA.
DON'T SAY IT.

04:15.771 --> 04:17.676
I GUESS PEOPLE
ONLY PAWN THINGS

04:17.677 --> 04:19.047
NOBODY WANTS.

04:19.048 --> 04:21.689
EVERY ACCORDION
IN THE CITY
MUST BE HERE.

04:21.690 --> 04:23.763
AS A MUSIC LOVER,
I'M GRATEFUL.

04:23.764 --> 04:26.137
HEY, HOW ABOUT
THIS, DUDES?

04:26.138 --> 04:29.013
SPLINTER COULD USE IT
TO TELL TIME.

04:29.014 --> 04:31.922
NO, FELLAS,
WE NEED SOMETHING--

04:31.923 --> 04:33.662
OH--SPECIAL.

04:33.663 --> 04:36.570
YEAH.
WHAT WE NEED IS

04:38.612 --> 04:40.316
WE LOOKING FOR

04:40.317 --> 04:43.292
A SPECIAL PRESENT
FOR A SPECIAL FRIEND.

04:43.293 --> 04:45.131
MAYBE SOMETHING
JAPANESE.

04:45.132 --> 04:47.807
JAPANESE, HUH?

04:47.808 --> 04:49.646
I HAVE JUST THE THING.

04:52.021 --> 04:53.191
FELLOW WHO HOCKED THIS

04:53.192 --> 04:55.531
TOLD ME IT WAS
AN AUTHENTIC
NINJA SWORD.

04:55.532 --> 04:58.508
AND THAT'S NOTHING
TO BE SNEEZED AT.

05:02.789 --> 05:05.664
THIS IS PERFECT.
HOW MUCH?

05:05.665 --> 05:07.102
HOW MUCH YOU GOT?

05:07.103 --> 05:08.808
WELL,
THAT ALL DEPENDS.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.550
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT
SUN-DRIED TOMATOES?

05:25.228 --> 05:28.270
THAT'S THE LAST TIME
I LET YOU SIT ON
MY LAP AND STEER.

05:32.284 --> 05:33.788
OH...WAIT.

05:33.789 --> 05:35.560
I'M ALREADY GETTING
A READING.

05:37.602 --> 05:39.773
THE ALIEN METAL
IS ACROSS THE STREET

05:39.774 --> 05:41.044
IN THAT PAWN SHOP.

05:41.045 --> 05:42.550
LET'S GO.

05:47.332 --> 05:49.170
WHAT?

05:49.171 --> 05:51.679
OOH, WE'RE LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING.

05:51.680 --> 05:53.652
HOW ABOUT
A NICE ACCORDION?

05:55.960 --> 05:58.969
GEE, THAT'S PRETTY.

06:00.006 --> 06:02.346
WHAT WE WANT IS
FAR MORE VALUABLE.

06:04.086 --> 06:06.760
THE ALIEN METAL IS GONE!

06:06.761 --> 06:10.305
THOSE FOUR MEN
WHO JUST LEFT--
WHAT DID THEY BUY?

06:10.306 --> 06:13.650
JUST AN OLD SWORD.
IT WASN'T EVEN SHARP.

06:13.651 --> 06:15.789
SWORDS ARE MADE
OF METAL.

06:17.998 --> 06:21.140
THIS IS
AN EXCELLENT
GIFT, DUDES.

06:27.796 --> 06:29.768
I WANT THAT SWORD.

06:29.769 --> 06:30.938
LET ME HAVE IT!

06:30.939 --> 06:32.510
YOU HEARD HIM,
GUYS.

06:32.511 --> 06:34.015
LET HIM HAVE IT!

06:36.190 --> 06:39.098
IT'S THOSE
BLASTED TURTLES!

06:39.099 --> 06:40.302
ATTACK!

06:42.109 --> 06:46.121
YOU'RE LIKE A BULL
IN A GARBAGE SHOP, DUDE.

07:01.137 --> 07:02.673
HEY. NOT FUNNY.

07:02.674 --> 07:03.878
DEFINITELY
NOT FUNNY.

07:05.483 --> 07:06.720
I LIKE IT, SHREDDER.

07:06.721 --> 07:09.195
YOU LOOK
QUITE DISTINGUISHED
WITH A PIPE.

07:23.308 --> 07:26.985
I'VE WAITED A LONG TIME
FOR THIS--TURTLE SUSHI.

07:32.838 --> 07:35.914
SAY YOUR
REPTILIAN PRAYERS,
TURTLE.

07:35.915 --> 07:38.021
CATCH THIS,
MELON-HEAD.

07:42.469 --> 07:45.544
NOW, FEEL THE WRATH
OF SHREDDER.

07:47.418 --> 07:48.488
WHAT'S THIS?

07:50.060 --> 07:51.999
YO, SHREDDER.

07:56.047 --> 07:58.553
UH, WHERE'D
THE BOSS GO?

07:58.554 --> 07:59.724
I DON'T KNOW.

07:59.725 --> 08:02.065
BUT I'M
DISAPPEARING, TOO!

08:04.239 --> 08:07.482
THERE'S SOMETHING REALLY
WEIRD GOING ON HERE.

08:10.760 --> 08:14.070
SHREDDER DISAPPEARED,
YOU SAY?

08:14.071 --> 08:17.280
GONE FROM THE FACE
OF THE EARTH.

08:17.281 --> 08:18.517
UH, YEAH.

08:18.518 --> 08:20.424
IF YOU LET THE TURTLES

08:20.425 --> 08:23.233
GET THEIR HANDS
ON THAT ALIEN METAL,

08:23.234 --> 08:25.908
YOU'LL RUE THE DAY
YOU MET ME!

08:25.909 --> 08:29.051
WE ALREADY DO RUE.

08:30.524 --> 08:32.830
I HAVE RETURNED,
KRANG.

08:32.831 --> 08:35.238
SHREDDER!

08:35.239 --> 08:37.410
NIFTY ENTRANCE,
BOSS.

08:37.412 --> 08:42.059
BUT I FAIL TO SEE
HOW A SWORD CAN CUT
THROUGH REALITY.

08:42.061 --> 08:45.738
THE METAL IN IT WAS USED
TO MAKE ALIEN SPACECRAFT

08:45.739 --> 08:49.952
THAT TRAVELED
BETWEEN DIMENSIONS
IN A MERE MICROSECOND.

08:49.953 --> 08:53.865
A VISITING SPACESHIP LEFT
A FRAGMENT OF THIS METAL
ON EARTH

08:53.866 --> 08:56.305
THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO.

08:56.306 --> 08:59.182
APPARENTLY,
A NINJA CRAFTSMAN

08:59.183 --> 09:02.994
FOUND THE ALIEN METAL
AND FORGED THIS SWORD.

09:04.099 --> 09:07.341
THAT ANCIENT SWORD MAKER
HAS HELPED SEAL THE FATE

09:07.342 --> 09:09.481
OF SPLINTER
AND THE TURTLES.

09:09.482 --> 09:12.291
YES! I JUST LOVE IT

09:12.292 --> 09:14.798
WHEN A PLAN COMES TOGETHER.

09:14.799 --> 09:16.571
IT SEEMED
TO CUT A HOLE

09:16.572 --> 09:19.681
THROUGH THIN AIR
INTO SOMETHING ELSE.

09:19.682 --> 09:22.088
YEAH.
TALK ABOUT SHARP!

09:22.089 --> 09:25.633
THERE IS A LEGEND
OF A MYSTERIOUS
NINJA SWORD

09:25.634 --> 09:27.405
THAT ALLOWED
ITS OWNER TO APPEAR

09:27.406 --> 09:29.244
AND DISAPPEAR
AT WILL.

09:29.245 --> 09:32.923
THE SWORD WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE A PRESENT
FOR YOU, MASTER.

09:32.924 --> 09:34.562
NEVER MIND,
LEONARDO.

09:34.563 --> 09:36.167
IT'S THE THOUGHT
THAT COUNTS.

09:36.168 --> 09:38.508
MORE IMPORTANTLY,
WE MUST RETRIEVE IT

09:38.509 --> 09:42.286
BEFORE SHREDDER
AND KRANG CAN USE IT
FOR THEIR EVIL PLANS.

09:42.287 --> 09:43.624
BUT HOW, MASTER?

09:43.625 --> 09:46.133
THERE IS
ONE POSSIBILITY.

09:47.571 --> 09:50.346
SPLINTER CALLING APRIL.
COME IN, APRIL.

09:51.350 --> 09:53.791
"HE PRESSED HER
TO HIS MANLY CHEST,

09:53.792 --> 09:55.630
AND WHISPERED
HER NAME."

09:55.631 --> 09:56.934
IRMA!

09:56.935 --> 09:59.576
AHH. IRMA.

09:59.577 --> 10:00.746
IRMA!

10:00.747 --> 10:03.188
QUICK, TELL APRIL
TO BRING HER CAMERA.

10:03.189 --> 10:05.662
I'M ABOUT
TO MAKE NEWS.

10:10.512 --> 10:12.250
APRIL, VERNON
WANTS YOU TO--

10:12.251 --> 10:13.989
APRIL?

10:13.990 --> 10:16.028
SHE'S GONE.

10:16.029 --> 10:18.670
FORGET APRIL.

10:18.671 --> 10:20.676
AND CALL
A VETERINARIAN!

10:23.086 --> 10:24.556
THIS MICROWAVE
TRANSMITTER

10:24.557 --> 10:27.533
SHOULD PENETRATE
ALL THE WAY TO
THE TECHNODROME.

10:27.534 --> 10:29.739
WHEN KRANG PICKS UP
THE SIGNAL,

10:29.740 --> 10:32.649
HE'LL THINK
HE'S WATCHING
A REAL NEWS BROADCAST.

10:32.650 --> 10:35.023
RADICAL CONCEPT,
DUDE.

10:35.024 --> 10:38.334
I'LL BET IT COOKS
A MEAN PIZZA, TOO.

10:40.174 --> 10:41.243
READY, APRIL?

10:41.244 --> 10:42.279
READY!

10:44.321 --> 10:46.627
<i>WE CAN NEVER MARRY,
JOHN.</i>

10:46.628 --> 10:49.502
<i>YOU SEE, I'M
YOUR TWIN SISTER.</i>

10:49.503 --> 10:52.914
<i>WE WERE SEPARATED
AT BIRTH DURING
A HOSPITAL BLACKOUT.</i>

10:52.915 --> 10:54.686
<i>YES, WE CAN,
MY DARLING.</i>

10:54.687 --> 10:56.692
<i>WHEN I WAS BORN,
AN INSANE NURSE</i>

10:56.693 --> 10:58.331
<i>SWITCHED ME
WITH ANOTHER BABY.</i>

10:58.332 --> 10:59.903
<i>OH, JOHN!</i>

10:59.904 --> 11:01.742
<i>OH, MARSHA!</i>

11:03.148 --> 11:05.086
IT'S SO...

11:05.087 --> 11:06.724
TRUE TO LIFE.

11:09.167 --> 11:10.872
<i>WE INTERRUPT</i>

11:10.873 --> 11:12.945
<i>FOR A SPECIAL
NEWS BULLETIN.</i>

11:12.946 --> 11:16.691
NO, NO! I WANT
JOHN AND MARSHA!

11:16.692 --> 11:18.429
<i>CHANNEL 6
HAS JUST LEARNED</i>

11:18.430 --> 11:20.001
<i>THE LOCATION OF
THE SECRET LAIR</i>

11:20.002 --> 11:22.543
<i>OF THOSE MYSTERIOUS
MUTANT TURTLES.</i>

11:22.544 --> 11:23.779
WHO CARES?

11:23.780 --> 11:25.485
WHAT? WHERE?

11:25.486 --> 11:27.324
<i>IN AN ABANDONED SECTION
OF THE SEWER</i>

11:27.325 --> 11:30.736
<i>BENEATH THE INTERSECTION
OF CENTER STREET
AND 3rd AVENUE.</i>

11:30.737 --> 11:33.243
I FOUND THE TURTLES!

11:33.244 --> 11:35.517
WHO NEEDS
JOHN AND MARSHA?

11:36.522 --> 11:37.992
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR HELP,

11:37.993 --> 11:39.363
BUT NOW
YOU MUST GO.

11:39.364 --> 11:41.436
IT IS DANGEROUS
FOR YOU TO REMAIN HERE.

11:41.437 --> 11:43.610
I JUST HOPE SHREDDER
WAS WATCHING.

11:45.618 --> 11:48.693
I WOULDN'T HAVE MISSED IT
FOR THE WORLD.

11:48.694 --> 11:50.198
SHREDDER!

11:50.199 --> 11:54.211
SPLINTER, YOU HAVE BEEN
A THORN IN MY SIDE TOO LONG.

11:54.212 --> 11:57.053
IT IS TIME
TO REMOVE YOU.

12:03.943 --> 12:07.353
YOUR TRAP WILL
NOT WORK, TURTLES.

12:07.354 --> 12:09.192
YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN
ONE THING--

12:09.193 --> 12:11.366
I HOLD THE SWORD!

12:14.711 --> 12:19.291
DUDE,
WHEN HE CUTS OUT,
HE REALLY CUTS OUT!

12:21.901 --> 12:24.073
PLEASE.
NO PICTURES.

12:41.230 --> 12:44.405
GET ME DOWN
FROM HERE!

12:45.911 --> 12:47.783
NIGHTY-NIGHT,
WIMP.

12:50.827 --> 12:53.636
LET'S SEE YOU
TRY THAT ON ME!

13:03.669 --> 13:06.711
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN,
OLD ONE.

13:06.712 --> 13:09.352
ARE YOU AFRAID
TO FACE ME
WITHOUT THE SWORD?

13:09.353 --> 13:12.329
ONLY A FOOL WOULD
THROW AWAY HIS ADVANTAGE.

13:17.547 --> 13:19.518
THEY'VE GONE!

13:19.519 --> 13:23.330
OH! AND I HAD IT
ALL ON TAPE.

13:27.277 --> 13:30.721
WELCOME
TO THE BACK
OF BEYOND.

13:30.722 --> 13:32.794
I HAVE DEFEATED
YOU EVERYWHERE,
SHREDDER.

13:32.795 --> 13:36.072
I CAN DEFEAT YOU
NOWHERE AS WELL.

13:39.283 --> 13:41.489
AND THERE ARE STILL
LESSONS

13:41.490 --> 13:43.595
THE STUDENT CAN LEARN
FROM HIS MASTER.

13:43.596 --> 13:46.439
AND A FEW THE MASTER
WILL NEVER LEARN.

13:55.702 --> 13:57.540
WHERE IS
MASTER SPLINTER?

13:57.541 --> 13:59.279
TRAPPED IN LIMBO,

13:59.280 --> 14:01.386
IN THE VOID
BEHIND REALITY

14:01.387 --> 14:03.962
WHERE HE SHALL
REMAIN FOREVER

14:03.963 --> 14:06.704
UNLESS YOU SURRENDER
TO ME.

14:10.148 --> 14:11.519
SURRENDER, TURTLES,

14:11.520 --> 14:13.927
<i>OR YOU WILL NEVER SEE
YOUR SENSEI AGAIN.</i>

14:13.928 --> 14:17.739
YOU HAVE
ONE HOUR TO DECIDE
YOUR MASTER'S FATE.

14:19.546 --> 14:21.952
ROCKSTEADY, BEBOP,
WIPE YOUR FEET,

14:21.953 --> 14:23.290
AND FOLLOW ME.

14:27.203 --> 14:30.781
DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN TRUST SHREDDER
TO SET SPLINTER FREE?

14:30.782 --> 14:33.724
THAT CREEP HAS
NEVER KEPT
HIS WORD YET.

14:33.725 --> 14:35.763
I'VE GOT A PLAN.

14:35.764 --> 14:37.168
BUT WE'VE GOT
TO GET SHREDDER

14:37.169 --> 14:39.241
TO MEET US AT
THE OLD AUTO JUNKYARD.

14:39.242 --> 14:42.585
HOW? BY SENDING
HIM AN ENGRAVED
INVITATION?

14:42.586 --> 14:45.260
I KNOW. WE'LL USE
CHANNEL 6's TRANSMITTER

14:45.261 --> 14:47.133
TO GET THE MESSAGE
THROUGH.

14:53.889 --> 14:57.366
Bebop: WHAT'S IN
THIS LIMBO PLACE,
BOSS?

14:57.367 --> 14:59.305
CAN'T YOU SEE?
THERE'S NOTHING.

14:59.306 --> 15:01.312
A VOID. EMPTINESS.

15:01.313 --> 15:03.052
LIKE THE INSIDE
OF YOUR SKULLS.

15:03.053 --> 15:04.221
SHREDDER!

15:07.299 --> 15:09.539
LET US FINISH
OUR DUEL.

15:09.540 --> 15:12.347
PERHAPS
IN ANOTHER LIFETIME.

15:18.368 --> 15:20.039
TOO LATE,
ANCIENT ONE.

15:21.277 --> 15:23.216
I MUST BE PATIENT.

15:23.217 --> 15:24.921
MY TIME WILL COME.

15:29.203 --> 15:30.372
APRIL!

15:30.373 --> 15:31.777
WHAT HAPPENED?

15:31.778 --> 15:34.050
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU WERE IN
A SEWER FIGHT.

15:34.051 --> 15:37.495
WHY, WHATEVER MAKES
YOU SAY THAT?

15:37.496 --> 15:39.669
WHEN SHE COMES IN
REEKING OF THE SEWERS,

15:39.670 --> 15:41.876
I SMELL A NEWS STORY.

15:47.696 --> 15:50.737
I KNEW IT!
SHE'S ONTO A BIG STORY.

15:50.738 --> 15:53.446
SHE'S NOT GOING TO
BEAT ME OUT OF THIS ONE.

16:04.148 --> 16:06.188
ALL SET, FELLAS.

16:06.189 --> 16:11.271
OK, GUYS.
IT'S SHOW TIME.

16:11.272 --> 16:15.082
APRIL, WHAT KIND OF
NEWS STORY COULD YOU
FIND IN A JUNKYARD?

16:15.083 --> 16:17.424
VERNON! WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

16:17.425 --> 16:20.768
SCOOPING YOU
ON YOUR OWN STORY.

16:20.769 --> 16:22.807
<i>YES, WE CAN,
MY DARLING.</i>

16:22.808 --> 16:25.650
<i>OH, JOHN.
JOHN, JOHN.</i>

16:25.651 --> 16:28.760
<i>OH, MARSHA.
MARSHA, MARSHA.</i>

16:28.761 --> 16:31.201
OH, NO.
NOT AGAIN.

16:32.205 --> 16:33.910
<i>THIS IS APRIL O'NEILL</i>

16:33.911 --> 16:35.849
<i>WITH A SPECIAL
NEWS BULLETIN.</i>

16:35.850 --> 16:38.291
<i>THE TEENAGE MUTANT
NINJA TURTLES HAVE</i>

16:38.292 --> 16:40.163
<i>JUST ANNOUNCED THAT
THEY WILL SURRENDER</i>

16:40.164 --> 16:42.103
<i>TO THEIR ARCHENEMY
SHREDDER</i>

16:42.104 --> 16:46.283
<i>AT THE CRASH 'EM
AND STASH 'EM
AUTO SALVAGE YARD.</i>

16:46.284 --> 16:50.162
OH, AT LAST.
VICTORY IS OURS.

16:50.163 --> 16:52.837
BETTER TAKE ALONG
A FEW FOOT SOLDIERS

16:52.838 --> 16:54.610
IN CASE
THOSE TURTLES HAVE

16:54.611 --> 16:57.017
SOMETHING UP
THEIR SHELLS.

16:57.018 --> 16:58.623
TO RECAP,
IN CASE SHREDDER--

16:58.624 --> 17:01.733
UH, IN CASE
YOU MIGHT HAVE
TUNED IN LATE,

17:01.734 --> 17:03.907
THE TURTLES ARE
READY TO SURRENDER.

17:05.445 --> 17:07.451
WHAT WAS THAT?

17:07.452 --> 17:09.925
I GUESS SHREDDER GOT
THE MESSAGE.

17:16.848 --> 17:18.353
WHAT?

17:20.393 --> 17:23.936
HEY, I SEE
SOMETHING.

17:23.938 --> 17:25.175
IS IT THE TURTLES?

17:26.346 --> 17:29.723
NO. IT'S
A '57 STUDEBAKER.

17:29.724 --> 17:31.428
AIN'T IT BEAUTIFUL?

17:33.435 --> 17:36.110
YOU'RE EXHAUSTING
MY PATIENCE.

17:36.111 --> 17:37.481
SHREDDER!

17:37.482 --> 17:39.019
WE SURRENDER.

17:39.020 --> 17:41.159
NOW, RELEASE
MASTER SPLINTER.

17:41.160 --> 17:44.269
WHAT IS THIS,
THE OLD SHELL GAME?

17:44.270 --> 17:45.841
I ONLY SEE 3 OF YOU.

17:45.842 --> 17:47.179
GET THE OTHER ONE,

17:47.180 --> 17:49.820
<i>OR YOU WILL NEVER SEE
YOUR SENSEI AGAIN.</i>

17:53.199 --> 17:55.873
WITH LUCK,
THIS ELECTROMAGNET
WILL PLUCK THAT SWORD

17:55.874 --> 17:57.946
RIGHT OUT
OF SHREDDER'S HAND.

18:00.623 --> 18:02.562
HIT THE DIRT!

18:02.563 --> 18:05.705
FOOLS!
YOU'RE WASTING
YOUR TIME.

18:05.706 --> 18:08.280
THE SWORD IS MADE
OF ALIEN METAL.

18:09.652 --> 18:11.490
MAGNETS ONLY PICK UP--

18:11.491 --> 18:14.198
IRON--AHH!

18:15.337 --> 18:17.142
WE HAVE LIFTOFF!

18:17.143 --> 18:18.814
DON'T JUST
STAND THERE!

18:18.815 --> 18:20.653
TURN OFF
THAT BLASTED MAGNET!

18:20.654 --> 18:22.158
RIGHT, BOSS.

18:25.436 --> 18:27.976
LET GO
OF OUR BOSS!

18:27.977 --> 18:31.020
YEAH. PUT
HIM DOWN.

18:37.608 --> 18:39.581
FOOTS UP,
HAND SOLDIERS!

18:39.582 --> 18:40.650
HOW'S THAT AGAIN?

18:40.651 --> 18:43.426
UH...YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN.

18:43.427 --> 18:47.172
HEY, STOP!
YOU'RE GOING
TO BREAK SOMETHING.

18:50.215 --> 18:51.686
I WARNED YOU GUYS.

18:58.576 --> 19:00.949
WAY TO GO,
DONATELLO.

19:00.950 --> 19:03.791
YOU SURE TRASHED
SHREDDER'S PLANS.

19:03.792 --> 19:04.895
COME ON.

19:04.896 --> 19:07.737
LET'S GET
THAT NINJA SWORD.

19:14.393 --> 19:16.065
WHAT THE HECK
IS THAT?

19:20.446 --> 19:23.421
AN ALIEN SPACESHIP.

19:26.934 --> 19:30.511
THIS PLANET
IS A DUMP.

19:30.512 --> 19:31.982
THESE EARTHLINGS
SURE KNOW HOW

19:31.983 --> 19:35.126
TO FOUL UP
THEIR ENVIRONMENT.

19:35.127 --> 19:39.005
BUT LOOK AT THIS SIMPLY
FABULOUS NINJA SWORD.

19:39.006 --> 19:41.346
IF YOU FIND ANY MORE
OF THESE,

19:41.347 --> 19:43.319
WOULD YOU SET IT ASIDE
FOR US?

19:43.320 --> 19:49.137
WE'LL BE BACK

19:49.138 --> 19:50.943
IS THAT MORNING
OR AFTERNOON?

19:52.917 --> 19:54.187
HEY, WAIT!

19:54.188 --> 19:56.996
<i>WE NEED THAT SWORD
TO RESCUE OUR SENSEI.</i>

19:56.997 --> 19:59.939
TOUGH TORTILLAS!

19:59.940 --> 20:02.648
WE CAN'T LET
THAT SWORD GET AWAY!

20:06.561 --> 20:08.700
THIS OUGHT
TO HOLD IT.

20:12.747 --> 20:14.385
MY NEWS VAN!

20:14.386 --> 20:16.191
OH! MY CAMERA!

20:16.192 --> 20:18.700
DONATELLO, THIS IS
ALL YOUR FAULT.

20:20.405 --> 20:22.846
WELL, IT SEEMED
LIKE A GOOD IDEA
AT THE TIME.

20:28.899 --> 20:31.875
I SENSE THE WORK
OF THE TURTLES HERE.

20:33.582 --> 20:35.955
I BELIEVE
THE EXPRESSION IS--

20:35.956 --> 20:38.262
COWABUNGA!

20:43.982 --> 20:45.887
MASTER!
YOU'RE BACK!

20:45.888 --> 20:49.498
SO, WHAT'S IT LIKE
ON THE FLIP SIDE
OF REALITY?

20:49.499 --> 20:52.340
IT IS A VOID
FILLED WITH NOTHING.

20:52.341 --> 20:56.085
EXCEPT MY NEWS VAN
AND MY CAMERA.

20:56.086 --> 20:57.089
SPLINTER!

20:57.090 --> 20:59.731
YOU WILL NOT ESCAPE ME
NEXT TIME.

21:03.444 --> 21:05.684
MASTER,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

21:05.685 --> 21:07.456
I'M FINE,
DONATELLO.

21:07.457 --> 21:09.930
LIMBO IS A NICE PLACE
TO VISIT,

21:09.931 --> 21:11.803
BUT I WOULDN'T WANT
TO LIVE THERE.

21:11.804 --> 21:14.245
OH, HOW AM I GOING
TO EXPLAIN

21:14.246 --> 21:15.716
THE MISSING
NEWS VAN TO BURNE?

21:15.717 --> 21:17.321
JUST TELL HIM
THE TRUTH.

21:17.322 --> 21:19.327
THE INTERGALACTIC
ANTIQUE COLLECTORS
GRABBED IT.

21:19.328 --> 21:22.036
RIGHT. VERNON WILL
BACK UP YOUR STORY.

21:22.037 --> 21:23.240
THAT REMINDS ME--

21:23.241 --> 21:25.046
WHERE IS VERNON,
ANYWAY?

21:25.047 --> 21:29.627
APRIL! SOMEBODY!
LET ME OUT!

21:29.628 --> 21:30.865
OH, MY GOSH!

21:30.866 --> 21:32.035
I FORGOT
ALL ABOUT HIM!

21:32.036 --> 21:33.975
HE'S STILL
IN THAT CAR TRUNK!

21:33.976 --> 21:36.449
COME ON, NOW,
THE JOKE'S OVER.

21:36.450 --> 21:38.121
LET ME OUT!
