00:19.990 --> 00:21.559
[Dick] <i>Previously on Titans...</i>

00:21.593 --> 00:23.728
-Bruce?
-I'm so glad
you all could make it.

00:23.762 --> 00:26.564
[Kory] <i>Bruce Wayne arranged</i>
<i>for us all to meet in this diner</i>

00:26.597 --> 00:29.065
<i>in the middle of nowhere</i>
<i>to mansplain us</i>

00:29.100 --> 00:30.835
into putting the Titans
back together?

00:30.867 --> 00:32.337
[electricity crackling]

00:32.369 --> 00:36.073
Five years stuck
inside this hell.

00:36.073 --> 00:37.140
[Slade] <i>You jumped into me.</i>

00:37.140 --> 00:38.408
[Jericho] <i>You're a monster.</i>

00:38.442 --> 00:40.610
-Where's Slade?
-[Adeline] San Francisco.

00:40.610 --> 00:41.512
He left this morning

00:41.512 --> 00:42.880
right after he called
his daughter.

00:42.880 --> 00:44.000
He played me.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.148
He gave me
a bank account.

00:45.149 --> 00:46.149
<i>he asked me for more.</i>

00:46.183 --> 00:47.951
What the fuck was I thinking?

00:47.984 --> 00:49.152
The Titans need us.

00:49.186 --> 00:50.887
Fuck them, Rose.

00:50.920 --> 00:52.122
<i>Okay, fuck all of you.</i>

00:52.155 --> 00:56.259
All we do is bring pain
with us, wherever we go.

00:56.293 --> 00:58.262
What do you want, Blackfire?

00:58.262 --> 00:59.396
[Blackfire]
We could rule together.

00:59.396 --> 01:00.965
It's always been
a dream of mine.

01:00.997 --> 01:02.665
I'm coming for you.

01:02.700 --> 01:05.837
Bye.

01:05.870 --> 01:09.307
Let's show Dick
what Master Wayne
had us put together.

01:09.340 --> 01:10.841
You've outdone yourselves.

01:10.876 --> 01:12.777
What happened to our friends,
Conner and Gar?

01:12.811 --> 01:17.013
They did some kind of
brain salad surgery on them.

01:17.048 --> 01:18.849
[classical music playing]

01:18.882 --> 01:20.650
[Gar snarls]

01:20.683 --> 01:22.052
[woman screams]

01:22.085 --> 01:23.921
We control them now. Phase One.

01:23.953 --> 01:25.423
[Donna] <i>What's Phase Two?</i>

01:25.456 --> 01:29.376
-[woman screaming]
-[Gar roaring]

01:32.996 --> 01:36.200
[Mercy] <i>This is how it ends.</i>

01:36.233 --> 01:39.905
It ends when we let evil win.

01:39.938 --> 01:43.039
When we accept it
not as something to be defeated

01:43.040 --> 01:46.109
but as part of our daily life.

01:46.143 --> 01:48.611
When the...

01:48.644 --> 01:51.182
horrific...

01:51.215 --> 01:54.686
becomes our new reality.

01:54.718 --> 01:57.254
We let CADMUS know
that evil exists in the world

01:57.254 --> 01:59.024
and we're uniquely positioned
to stop it.

01:59.057 --> 02:04.057
We will not sit idly by
and let evil have its way.

02:05.263 --> 02:07.498
Today, the triumph
of good over evil

02:07.531 --> 02:09.967
becomes not something
you must only dream of,

02:10.000 --> 02:12.637
but something you can earn.

02:12.669 --> 02:14.939
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity

02:14.973 --> 02:19.342
to purchase
a fully programmable
super soldier...

02:19.377 --> 02:23.576
customizable for your needs.

02:24.514 --> 02:27.814
Turn for them, Conner.

02:31.088 --> 02:34.157
Of course,
we wouldn't expect you
to make a bid

02:34.191 --> 02:37.794
without seeing a demonstration.

02:37.828 --> 02:39.930
Go ahead.

02:39.963 --> 02:43.713
Just as you've been told.

03:01.885 --> 03:04.688
Think of that as a preview
of coming attractions.

03:04.722 --> 03:07.925
We'll be providing you
with a satellite link
and a code.

03:07.959 --> 03:11.096
Set your schedules
to 9:00 p.m., Pacific time.

03:11.128 --> 03:16.329
And witness what happens
when good people
put an end to evil.

03:20.104 --> 03:23.639
[Walter laughing and clapping]

03:23.674 --> 03:25.543
Nice touch!

03:25.576 --> 03:27.277
Always leaving wanting more.

03:27.311 --> 03:30.146
-Walter, one more thing.
-Yeah?

03:30.181 --> 03:31.230
Conner.

03:37.221 --> 03:41.925
[grunts]

03:41.959 --> 03:43.308
Good boy.

03:52.203 --> 03:56.941
Welcome to Phase Two.

03:56.973 --> 04:00.574
[carnival music playing]

04:33.377 --> 04:37.127
[classical music playing]

04:42.319 --> 04:43.819
[snarling]

04:54.531 --> 04:56.482
[music stops]

05:12.283 --> 05:13.817
[Donna] Jericho is alive?

05:13.817 --> 05:15.687
Don't tell me
Dick actually said that.

05:15.687 --> 05:18.990
Well, more like scrawled it
on the wall of his cell.

05:18.990 --> 05:21.192
-Like caveman-style.
-I don't even know
what that's supposed to mean.

05:21.225 --> 05:24.696
It's a style Neanderthals used
to depict images in cave walls.

05:24.728 --> 05:29.701
Usually battle scenes
or hunting.

05:29.733 --> 05:31.901
I meant that Jericho's alive.

05:31.935 --> 05:33.372
Oh. Sorry.

05:33.404 --> 05:36.307
Well, one thing's for sure.
He has clearly lost his mind.

05:36.339 --> 05:37.975
But I keep having these dreams

05:38.009 --> 05:40.845
about Dick being killed
by Deathstroke.

05:40.879 --> 05:43.980
And they're not going away.
We need to do something
about that.

05:43.980 --> 05:44.980
[Donna] I believe you.

05:44.980 --> 05:49.119
But we have bigger problems
right now.

05:49.153 --> 05:51.156
Okay, what's the plan?

05:51.189 --> 05:53.725
Well, the main CADMUS building
closes at 9:00

05:53.757 --> 05:55.593
and security drops down to ten.

05:55.625 --> 05:57.829
It's two at each gate
and six roaming inside.

05:57.862 --> 05:59.497
[Donna] Okay,
what about the lab?

05:59.529 --> 06:00.850
[Dawn] Whole different story.

06:00.850 --> 06:04.002
It's a 24-hour operation
and in the last week
they've doubled up the guard.

06:04.035 --> 06:07.637
Four six-hour shifts,
20 bodies around the clock.

06:07.637 --> 06:09.574
Sounds like
that's where the party's at.

06:09.607 --> 06:11.742
Okay. Well, let's crash it.

06:11.776 --> 06:14.377
Oh, so we're just gonna
break into CADMUS

06:14.411 --> 06:16.247
and get Conner
and Gar out of there.

06:16.279 --> 06:17.848
Just the four of us?

06:17.882 --> 06:19.884
We don't have
a choice right now, okay?

06:19.918 --> 06:22.552
But between you and Kory,
we have plenty of fire power.

06:22.586 --> 06:24.422
At least to get us in
through the front door.

06:24.454 --> 06:28.692
About that.
I've got some bad news.

06:28.692 --> 06:31.095
-My powers have vanished.
-What?

06:31.127 --> 06:32.396
[stutters] What do you mean?

06:32.430 --> 06:35.000
I don't know.
I don't know what happened.
But they're gone

06:35.033 --> 06:37.769
and I haven't been able
to get them back.

06:37.802 --> 06:39.637
[exhales]
Well, that's fucking great.

06:39.670 --> 06:41.204
Um, what about you?

06:41.206 --> 06:44.475
Fully loaded.
But I can't promise that I...

06:44.509 --> 06:46.511
won't go
a little bit overboard.

06:46.543 --> 06:50.413
Um, things have been getting...
dramatic.

06:50.447 --> 06:52.550
[beeps]

06:52.583 --> 06:54.619
[Kory reading] "A disturbance
at Golden Gate Park.

06:54.651 --> 06:57.254
Units responding.
People are injured.

06:57.288 --> 07:01.959
Reports of a wild animal."

07:01.992 --> 07:04.629
Phase Two.

07:04.661 --> 07:07.512
It's already begun.

07:12.899 --> 07:14.737
Look, I don't know
what we're going up against

07:14.738 --> 07:17.608
but I can guarantee
it won't be pretty.

07:17.641 --> 07:19.576
We're going up
against our friends.

07:19.610 --> 07:24.310
May not be our friends anymore.

07:24.382 --> 07:25.483
I won't hurt Gar.

07:25.483 --> 07:28.151
I don't care
what they've done to him.

07:28.185 --> 07:32.023
I just won't.

07:32.057 --> 07:35.225
If they're hurting
innocent people,
we need to be prepared.

07:35.259 --> 07:38.596
[explosion]

07:38.629 --> 07:43.367
[Donna] Deathstroke. Get down!

07:43.401 --> 07:45.502
I'll draw his fire.
You guys hit him
with all you got.

07:45.536 --> 07:48.971
-[both] No.
-Kory, no!

07:49.005 --> 07:51.076
[yelps]

07:51.108 --> 07:54.310
-[Dawn] What happened?
-[breathes heavily]

07:54.345 --> 07:55.345
[thud]

08:09.961 --> 08:13.860
You should've stayed home.

08:15.466 --> 08:17.334
[Slade grunts]

08:17.367 --> 08:21.538
What the fuck?

08:21.572 --> 08:23.208
-Dick?
-Who's hit?

08:23.240 --> 08:26.410
-Kory.
-You take care of her.
I'll take care of him.

08:26.444 --> 08:31.115
This is my fight.

08:31.149 --> 08:35.086
[Slade] New costume,
but the same old Dick Grayson.

08:35.120 --> 08:39.355
I told you what would happen
if the Titans ever reunited.

08:39.389 --> 08:42.389
Now, it's happening.

08:45.962 --> 08:47.831
Jericho.

08:47.865 --> 08:50.000
<i>I know you're in there.</i>
<i>I know you're alive.</i>

08:50.033 --> 08:54.105
[Slade] Don't say his name!

08:54.139 --> 08:56.038
[Dick]
Is that the best you got?

09:03.212 --> 09:04.014
Dick!

09:04.014 --> 09:08.514
My son is dead because of you!

09:09.119 --> 09:10.754
[both grunting]

09:10.788 --> 09:13.890
[Donna]
I've never seen you bleed.

09:13.924 --> 09:17.674
I didn't think you could.

09:21.649 --> 09:22.566
[Rachel chuckles softly]

09:22.566 --> 09:26.316
[Dick and Slade grunting]

09:33.644 --> 09:36.043
[Slade chuckles]

09:46.658 --> 09:49.426
-[Dick] Jericho.
-[Slade] You don't get to say
his name!

09:49.460 --> 09:50.695
You're in there, buddy.

09:50.727 --> 09:52.495
<i>Now's the time.</i>

09:52.529 --> 09:56.299
[electrical buzzing]

09:56.332 --> 09:58.732
[Slade grunting]

10:02.472 --> 10:04.307
Don't feel bad.

10:04.341 --> 10:06.878
It was never gonna work.

10:06.910 --> 10:09.513
You depend on others
for your strength.

10:09.547 --> 10:10.581
[Dick grunts]

10:10.615 --> 10:13.517
I depend on no one.

10:13.551 --> 10:15.552
You should've stayed away.

10:15.586 --> 10:18.288
Now, you're gonna die
with your friends.

10:18.322 --> 10:19.522
[Rose] Dad!

10:22.692 --> 10:25.395
[Slade]
I see you've changed your mind.

10:25.428 --> 10:26.965
[Slade chuckles]

10:26.998 --> 10:30.134
She's the one who told me
that you all got back together.

10:30.168 --> 10:32.470
She's been working for me
the whole time.

10:32.470 --> 10:36.173
I heard.

10:36.206 --> 10:38.207
Is that you?

10:38.241 --> 10:40.610
The one and only.

10:40.644 --> 10:42.679
You've finally accepted
your true family.

10:42.712 --> 10:46.283
I have.

10:46.317 --> 10:49.953
Titans are my family.

10:49.988 --> 10:51.889
Don't make me kill you.

10:51.923 --> 10:56.572
[Slade] Don't worry. You won't.

11:27.291 --> 11:28.860
[Rose] Dad!

11:28.893 --> 11:30.927
[Slade grunts]

11:30.961 --> 11:32.529
[Rose screams]

11:32.562 --> 11:35.732
No!

11:35.765 --> 11:36.966
[groans]

11:43.440 --> 11:45.389
[Slade gasps]

11:48.645 --> 11:49.880
Jericho.

11:49.913 --> 11:54.913
If you're in there,
you know what to do.

12:09.466 --> 12:12.615
[Slade grunts softly]

12:23.748 --> 12:26.683
[sword clangs to ground]

12:26.716 --> 12:29.385
You heard what he said.

12:29.419 --> 12:30.453
Yeah.

12:30.486 --> 12:31.956
I'm sorry.

12:31.989 --> 12:35.359
Forget it. You okay?

12:35.392 --> 12:38.394
I will be.

12:38.428 --> 12:42.028
He wants to talk to you.

12:43.500 --> 12:47.571
[breathing heavily]

12:47.605 --> 12:49.539
Jericho?

12:49.572 --> 12:52.423
Is that really you?

12:55.613 --> 12:57.113
What's up?

13:02.153 --> 13:05.022
It's good
to have you back, kid.

13:05.056 --> 13:06.590
Thank you, Dick,

13:06.624 --> 13:09.493
for finding me.

13:09.525 --> 13:11.895
I'm sorry for everything.

13:11.928 --> 13:14.899
I understand
why you did what you did.

13:14.932 --> 13:19.070
I know
what the Titans stand for.

13:19.102 --> 13:22.072
When you died, it broke us.

13:22.105 --> 13:23.774
We're together again.

13:23.807 --> 13:25.976
You were always a part
of our family.

13:26.009 --> 13:27.778
You still are...

13:27.812 --> 13:31.782
if you wanna be.

13:31.816 --> 13:34.686
[exhales]

13:34.720 --> 13:37.688
This is gonna take
a little getting used to but...

13:37.722 --> 13:41.558
-I gotta say,
I like the new digs.
-[chuckles]

13:41.591 --> 13:42.592
I get it.

13:42.625 --> 13:46.363
Is he...

13:46.397 --> 13:48.331
Dead?

13:48.365 --> 13:49.799
Yeah.

13:49.833 --> 13:51.168
How's Kory?

13:51.201 --> 13:56.039
Rachel patched her up.

13:56.073 --> 13:58.942
Let's go home.

13:58.975 --> 14:02.581
The night's not quite over yet.

14:02.614 --> 14:07.614
[police officer] Oh, shit!
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

14:07.951 --> 14:09.120
-[Gar growls]
-I need backup.

14:09.153 --> 14:11.154
-999, City Center.
-[Gar growls]

14:11.154 --> 14:12.690
-[police officer] Repeat. Backup.
-[Gar growls]

14:12.690 --> 14:14.424
Emergency units. Please.

14:14.457 --> 14:17.695
Help.

14:17.727 --> 14:20.130
[growls]

14:20.163 --> 14:23.033
[tires screech]

14:23.067 --> 14:24.769
[Mercy] Please remain calm.

14:24.802 --> 14:26.836
This is CADMUS cooperation.

14:26.870 --> 14:29.421
Help has arrived.

14:33.476 --> 14:35.876
[sirens blaring]

14:39.482 --> 14:40.832
[roaring]

14:46.600 --> 14:47.605
Fall back.

14:48.293 --> 14:49.961
Ladies and gentlemen,

14:49.994 --> 14:53.293
let the bidding begin.

14:55.932 --> 14:57.582
[Gar roars]

15:08.678 --> 15:09.729
[roars]

15:24.828 --> 15:27.828
We've got a problem.

15:31.034 --> 15:33.705
No, we have an opportunity.

15:33.738 --> 15:38.738
Let's let everybody see
what he's capable of.

15:40.076 --> 15:44.581
Any ideas?

15:44.615 --> 15:49.052
Hey, Conner.

15:49.086 --> 15:53.885
That's your idea?
"Hey, Conner"?

15:54.958 --> 15:56.927
[Rachel] Gar.

15:56.961 --> 16:00.764
-Gar, it's me.
-[Gar growls]

16:00.798 --> 16:02.832
Are you okay?

16:02.866 --> 16:06.703
I know they did something
to you.

16:06.736 --> 16:10.407
But we need you, Gar.

16:10.440 --> 16:13.476
[Gar roars]

16:13.509 --> 16:15.645
Okay, Gar.

16:15.678 --> 16:18.379
That was not cool.

16:20.985 --> 16:23.855
Why is he looking at me
like that?

16:23.889 --> 16:28.292
Probably 'cause you're dressed
like a giant bird.

16:28.326 --> 16:30.327
[Kory] He has no clue
who we are.

16:30.360 --> 16:32.796
I think
you should go talk to him.

16:32.830 --> 16:34.030
Why me?

16:34.065 --> 16:36.366
I don't know, he is Kryptonian.

16:36.366 --> 16:38.034
You're Themysciran.
Maybe he'll relate.

16:38.034 --> 16:40.804
Okay.

16:40.837 --> 16:41.837
Fine.

16:46.344 --> 16:49.179
Hi, Conner.
Pleasure to meet you.

16:49.212 --> 16:52.750
I'm Donna Troy.

16:52.783 --> 16:54.418
We haven't officially met

16:54.451 --> 16:59.451
but you know,
I've heard great things.

17:02.927 --> 17:04.295
Okay, fuck it.

17:04.328 --> 17:05.395
Look, I don't know
who's pulling your strings
right now

17:05.430 --> 17:07.265
but you need to snap out of it,
okay?

17:07.298 --> 17:09.534
From what they say,
you're at least half Superman,

17:09.567 --> 17:14.567
so can we dig down
and find that half?

17:19.143 --> 17:21.378
Conner, please ki...

17:21.412 --> 17:24.561
Eliminate the Titans.

17:32.323 --> 17:34.423
That was rude.

18:06.156 --> 18:07.156
[speaking alien language]

18:08.358 --> 18:12.329
[Kory screams]

18:12.363 --> 18:15.199
Fuck, I regret it.

18:15.232 --> 18:17.402
[Kory struggles]

18:17.434 --> 18:20.804
[Hank] Let my friend go!

18:20.837 --> 18:22.740
-[laughs]
-[scoffs]

18:22.773 --> 18:24.741
[grunts] I should've seen
that coming.

18:24.775 --> 18:26.844
[Kory struggles]

18:26.876 --> 18:28.826
[Hank grunts]

18:31.981 --> 18:33.217
What are we up to?

18:33.250 --> 18:35.786
[man] 200 million
for exclusive worldwide rights.

18:35.786 --> 18:36.653
And rising.

18:36.653 --> 18:38.355
Should have asked Luthor
for 20%.

18:38.388 --> 18:40.638
[Kory grunting]

18:44.194 --> 18:47.498
Hey, Conner!

18:47.531 --> 18:49.099
What the fuck
are you doing here?

18:49.099 --> 18:50.400
Saving your life.

18:50.400 --> 18:52.403
-I'm doing just fine, clearly.
-I couldn't let you die

18:52.403 --> 18:54.571
before I had a chance
to apologize.

18:54.571 --> 18:56.173
We'll talk about this later,
Hank.

18:56.207 --> 18:58.576
All right, guys.
We might need to kill him.

18:58.609 --> 19:00.009
-Sounds great.
-Let's do it.

19:00.044 --> 19:01.412
I'm not sure we can.

19:01.445 --> 19:03.780
-[screen beeping]
-[man] The bidding's
through the roof!

19:03.814 --> 19:07.584
What the...

19:07.584 --> 19:08.585
Fix it.

19:08.618 --> 19:10.587
I can't.

19:10.622 --> 19:12.323
Something's blocking the feed.

19:12.355 --> 19:15.960
[Bruce] <i>Technical difficulties,</i>
<i>Ms. Graves.</i>

19:15.992 --> 19:19.292
[serene music playing]

19:30.407 --> 19:33.907
It appears bidding is closed
for the day.

19:35.512 --> 19:38.512
[cell phone ringing]

19:43.153 --> 19:45.554
It's Mr. Luthor.

19:54.265 --> 19:56.664
[device beeping]

20:09.279 --> 20:11.016
Perfect timing.

20:11.048 --> 20:13.384
[Hank] Things are getting
super fuckin' ugly out here.

20:13.417 --> 20:15.252
You're not gonna make fun
of my suit?

20:15.286 --> 20:16.787
I just did.

20:16.819 --> 20:18.355
I've missed this.

20:18.388 --> 20:20.625
We have a very angry Superboy.
You have thoughts?

20:20.657 --> 20:23.794
Other than yelling,
"Hey, Conner."

20:23.826 --> 20:25.462
Yeah.

20:25.496 --> 20:27.131
But we need Rachel.

20:27.163 --> 20:29.666
Gar, we don't have much time.

20:29.701 --> 20:31.769
-Do you remember...
-[Gar growls softly]

20:31.803 --> 20:34.271
...we were back
in Angela's house...

20:34.305 --> 20:36.607
Trigon was trying
to turn everyone dark.

20:36.641 --> 20:39.243
You were the only one
he couldn't turn.

20:39.278 --> 20:44.278
When you touched me,
you reminded me
who I really was.

20:45.750 --> 20:49.319
-So, I'm gonna touch your paw.
-[low growl]

20:49.353 --> 20:53.290
Your hand.

20:53.324 --> 20:55.960
'Cause I know
who you really are...

20:55.992 --> 20:57.494
even if you don't.

20:57.528 --> 21:01.577
-[roars]
-Please come back.

21:05.935 --> 21:06.986
[roars]

21:21.318 --> 21:25.623
[gasps]

21:25.656 --> 21:29.406
-[chuckles] Gar!
-Rachel.

21:45.276 --> 21:50.013
[Conner grunts]

21:50.047 --> 21:54.618
Rachel, now!

21:54.652 --> 21:57.320
[Mercy] Conner,
they are not your family!
Fight them!

21:57.355 --> 21:58.588
[Conner struggles]

21:58.623 --> 22:01.358
[Rachel] Dick, hurry up,
this guy's really strong.

22:01.392 --> 22:03.528
[Rachel grunts]

22:03.560 --> 22:04.827
It's all you now.

22:04.862 --> 22:07.112
It's all us now

22:17.040 --> 22:19.442
[Mercy] <i>Conner.</i> [echoes]

-[Dick] Conner?
-[Donna] <i>I'm trying!</i>

[Mercy] <i>You're mine, Conner.</i>

-[Rachel] <i>Dick!</i>

22:32.623 --> 22:35.727
[Mercy] <i>Fight this, Conner.</i>

22:35.759 --> 22:38.061
[Dick] I don't know
what they're doing to you.

22:38.095 --> 22:39.363
But you're going to be okay.

22:39.396 --> 22:41.031
You're not alone anymore.

22:41.066 --> 22:43.467
-[Mercy] <i>Fight for your soul.</i>
-Her voice.

22:43.500 --> 22:45.536
[Mercy] <i>You are mine.</i>

22:45.569 --> 22:47.304
[voice breaks]
She tells me what to do.

22:47.337 --> 22:48.538
[Mercy] <i>Kill them, Conner.</i>

22:48.573 --> 22:51.175
I can't make it stop.

22:51.209 --> 22:53.777
-What is she telling you to do?
-[Mercy] <i>Kill them all.</i>

22:53.809 --> 22:56.513
Kill them.

22:56.547 --> 22:58.214
Kill them all.

[Mercy] <i>Kill them, Conner.</i>

23:08.291 --> 23:10.428
Tell me how I can help you.

[screaming]

24:41.018 --> 24:42.067
[gasps]

24:51.695 --> 24:53.997
[Conner] I know you.

24:54.030 --> 24:55.700
I'm Dick Grayson.

24:55.732 --> 24:57.634
How did you find me?

24:57.667 --> 25:00.203
You're part of our family,
Conner.

25:00.237 --> 25:03.537
We'll always find you.

25:05.576 --> 25:07.076
Thank you.

25:22.926 --> 25:26.977
You might wanna stand back.

25:47.518 --> 25:48.618
[Dick] Conner?

25:48.653 --> 25:52.189
Please, let me go...

25:52.221 --> 25:54.922
so I can end this.

25:57.260 --> 25:59.510
[Rachel grunts]

26:09.272 --> 26:10.772
Thank you.

26:27.590 --> 26:28.893
Shit.

26:28.925 --> 26:31.494
Concentrate all firepower
on Subject 13.

26:31.528 --> 26:32.563
Take him down!

-[soldier 4] Run!

26:50.681 --> 26:52.717
It's over.

26:52.750 --> 26:54.518
This is for Lex Luthor.

26:54.551 --> 26:58.055
[grunts]

26:58.087 --> 26:59.288
Damn it!

27:18.509 --> 27:20.159
I did this.

27:23.914 --> 27:25.883
It wasn't me, but...

27:25.916 --> 27:29.353
But I did this.

27:29.385 --> 27:32.022
I'm sorry.

27:32.056 --> 27:36.161
We know.
It's good to have you back.

27:36.193 --> 27:40.064
Did anyone ever tell you
you can really throw a punch?

27:40.097 --> 27:41.731
[woman] Thank you, Titans!

-Mommy, my dolly!
-[woman] It's there, baby.

28:09.926 --> 28:11.228
Is this your dolly?

28:11.260 --> 28:13.163
She's safe now.

28:13.163 --> 28:14.163
Thank you.

28:14.163 --> 28:15.932
Of course.

28:49.733 --> 28:50.834

29:46.557 --> 29:51.557
<i>Nor do we exit it lightly.</i>

30:04.041 --> 30:08.541
We leave a piece of us behind.

30:25.596 --> 30:28.400
<i>And sometimes the cost</i>
<i>of defending the innocent</i>

30:28.400 --> 30:33.400
<i>exceeds what we could ever</i>

31:20.017 --> 31:24.354
<i>There's only one word for this.</i>

31:24.387 --> 31:27.087
<i>Sacrifice.</i>

<i>or in some distant time,</i>

31:35.900 --> 31:40.738

31:40.770 --> 31:45.570
<i>this is the hero's duty.</i>

31:58.021 --> 31:59.521
Thank you.

32:09.133 --> 32:13.136
[Rachel] Are they taking her
back to Themyscira?

32:13.171 --> 32:15.638
They have a place
for warriors like Donna.

32:15.638 --> 32:17.307
Sacred grounds.

32:17.342 --> 32:21.346
I should go with Donna.

32:21.378 --> 32:24.582
If anybody can help her,
it's me.

32:24.582 --> 32:26.284
Look, we all
wanna bring her back, Rachel.

32:26.284 --> 32:28.685
You don't understand.

32:28.719 --> 32:30.954
My powers are changing.

32:30.954 --> 32:33.257
Getting stronger and...

32:33.290 --> 32:36.394
Like, I think
I've actually been inside
your head.

32:36.426 --> 32:38.061
Like, I can take your thoughts

32:38.095 --> 32:39.896
and bring 'em to life.

32:39.930 --> 32:42.866
I've seen you do
some amazing things.

32:42.900 --> 32:45.068
And considering
what's in my head...

32:45.102 --> 32:46.403
that's pretty messed up.

32:46.435 --> 32:47.805
[chuckles]

32:47.837 --> 32:50.375
Look, all I'm saying is,

32:50.407 --> 32:53.211
if there is any chance...

32:53.243 --> 32:55.278
If you wanna go,
I'm not gonna stop you.

32:55.313 --> 32:58.516
But remember,
doesn't matter
how strong we are,

32:58.549 --> 33:01.551
we can't
always change the world.

33:01.551 --> 33:03.820
But we can try.

33:03.854 --> 33:05.953
We should try.

33:13.830 --> 33:16.567
Go with Donna.

33:16.601 --> 33:18.702
Your room
will be waiting for you
when you get back.

33:18.737 --> 33:20.971
Who knows,
maybe I'll stay on the island.

33:21.005 --> 33:22.373
[chuckles] Watch out.

33:22.406 --> 33:24.976
Space witch skin

33:25.009 --> 33:29.509
[chuckles] Yeah, I'll survive.

33:30.047 --> 33:33.750
Will you?

33:33.784 --> 33:35.884
I'll miss you.

33:42.726 --> 33:45.195
And the others?

33:45.229 --> 33:47.964
-[Dick] I'll let 'em know.
-[Rachel] Thanks.

33:47.999 --> 33:51.836
Be careful.

33:51.868 --> 33:54.868
Yes, sir. [chuckles]

34:24.934 --> 34:27.184
[jet takes off]

35:18.956 --> 35:21.659
[Bruce] I'm terribly sorry.

35:21.693 --> 35:25.862
I know how much
Donna meant to you.

35:25.896 --> 35:29.467
I'm the reason she came back.

35:29.500 --> 35:33.103
I pulled her back
into the Titans.

35:33.137 --> 35:34.639
Well...

35:34.672 --> 35:36.340
I wouldn't fool yourself
into thinking

35:36.375 --> 35:41.375
you could have made Donna Troy
do something
she didn't wanna do herself.

35:43.213 --> 35:47.985
True.

35:48.018 --> 35:50.418
We started this.

35:56.293 --> 36:00.597
What's left of us without her?

36:00.632 --> 36:04.869
[Bruce]
Things inevitably fall apart.

36:04.902 --> 36:09.902
The art of life seems to be in
how you put them back together.

36:12.577 --> 36:14.710
Sounds
suspiciously like advice.

36:14.744 --> 36:16.347
I know.

36:16.380 --> 36:18.949
I've been working on it
for a while.

36:18.949 --> 36:21.851
Not that I'm an expert
in the life department.

36:21.885 --> 36:23.554
You've done okay.

36:23.588 --> 36:28.588
-You felt otherwise at times.
-True.

36:30.161 --> 36:33.030
I guess I, uh...

36:33.065 --> 36:37.434
don't feel the need
to battle the past anymore.

36:37.467 --> 36:39.903
I know why you did it.

36:39.936 --> 36:42.706
Took me in as a kid.

36:42.706 --> 36:43.675
Okay.

36:43.675 --> 36:45.210
Whether you knew it then
or not,

36:45.244 --> 36:48.644
you were giving me
the one thing
neither of us ever had.

36:48.679 --> 36:50.028
A family.

36:54.485 --> 36:57.320
Well, perhaps.

36:57.355 --> 36:58.989
If you're right,
you're welcome.

36:59.023 --> 37:03.862
This Titans family is something
worth keeping together.

37:03.894 --> 37:07.097
Uh, can you take
one more nugget of wisdom?

37:07.130 --> 37:08.833
[chuckles] Sure.

37:08.867 --> 37:11.335
Fight the impulse
to turn inward.

37:11.369 --> 37:13.804
To turn away from others.

37:13.838 --> 37:16.306
Your team is in grief
and needs healing.

37:16.340 --> 37:21.340
It's a process
best not done alone.

37:21.340 --> 37:22.880
You've been sittin'
on that one, too?

37:22.914 --> 37:25.449
Oh, just pulled it out
in the moment.

37:25.483 --> 37:27.418
-How did it sound?
-Pretty good.

37:27.452 --> 37:30.019
Uh, I'll keep working on it.

37:30.054 --> 37:34.157
-I'll see you at dinner.
-Hmm.

37:34.190 --> 37:36.494
Oh, and uh...

37:36.527 --> 37:37.929
thanks for the suit,
by the way.

37:37.963 --> 37:41.331
I'm pleased you patched it up
with Stuart.

37:41.364 --> 37:43.467
Cranky bastard
made me work for it.

37:43.501 --> 37:45.969
It's a far cry from Robin.

37:46.003 --> 37:47.652
That it is.

37:58.449 --> 38:00.699
[knock on door]

38:05.856 --> 38:09.293
Hey.

38:09.327 --> 38:12.626
Found this on her bed.

38:14.965 --> 38:17.965
Is that Frida Kahlo?

38:20.003 --> 38:21.505
That was her jam.

38:21.539 --> 38:23.675
Yeah, I didn't really know her.

38:23.708 --> 38:27.612
-Donna.
-What you saw was who she was.

38:27.644 --> 38:30.347
She cared for people.
Cared for doing right.

38:30.380 --> 38:33.684
I hurt...

38:33.717 --> 38:37.168
so many people and I...

38:39.322 --> 38:41.891
And I don't even remember
doing it.

38:41.925 --> 38:43.161
It wasn't you.

38:43.195 --> 38:45.963
-And it wasn't your fault.
-Really?
Then whose fault was it?

38:45.996 --> 38:48.233
[Dick] Mine.

38:48.266 --> 38:52.001
I left you here alone.
I never should have done that.

38:52.036 --> 38:54.039
So that's on me.

38:54.072 --> 38:57.173
You fought like hell
to keep the Titans alive.

38:57.208 --> 39:01.813
But I let you down.

39:01.846 --> 39:05.215
And all I can do is promise
it'll never happen again.

39:05.248 --> 39:09.920
Thanks.

39:09.952 --> 39:11.722
I'm making dinner.

39:11.755 --> 39:16.755
If you feel up to it,
I could use your help.

39:17.161 --> 39:21.210
[grunts] When you're ready.

39:24.367 --> 39:26.318
[door closes]

39:34.911 --> 39:35.961
[sighs]

39:49.193 --> 39:50.193
Hi.

39:54.998 --> 39:56.099
Hey.

39:56.101 --> 39:57.900
I didn't have
a whole big thing planned.

39:57.934 --> 40:01.739
I just, uh...

40:01.773 --> 40:03.641
wanted to see how you're doing.

40:03.675 --> 40:06.110
How do you think?

40:06.143 --> 40:09.742
She died saving my life.

40:11.615 --> 40:13.983
I was never good
at comforting you.

40:14.018 --> 40:16.119
That's not true.

40:16.152 --> 40:18.722
I mean, at first, maybe.

40:18.755 --> 40:21.759
Then after, it was...

40:21.793 --> 40:26.030
more me fallin' apart
and you puttin'
me back together.

40:26.063 --> 40:28.465
Until there wasn't much left
to put back together.

40:28.498 --> 40:33.269
Sounds about right.

40:33.304 --> 40:35.474
I get it.

40:35.507 --> 40:40.110
I thought you said all we did
was bring pain into the world.

40:40.143 --> 40:43.146
I did.

40:43.146 --> 40:44.181
I was an asshole.

40:44.181 --> 40:47.719
Nothin' I can say
can make up for that.

40:47.751 --> 40:49.487
While I was away, I had
a chance to think

40:49.487 --> 40:54.487
about some of the good
that we did, too.

40:55.326 --> 40:59.530
Let me ask you somethin'.

40:59.563 --> 41:04.768
What if we give it
another shot?

41:04.768 --> 41:08.840
[voice breaks]
I don't think so.

41:08.873 --> 41:13.523
I think Hank and Dawn are over.

41:18.181 --> 41:21.931
What about Hawk and Dove?

41:37.434 --> 41:39.137
What was her deal
with tomatoes?

41:39.170 --> 41:41.472
She called it,
"The Devil's Fruit."

41:41.505 --> 41:43.474
Hold on.

41:43.507 --> 41:44.541
Tomato is a fruit?

41:44.574 --> 41:46.824
[Kory chuckles]

41:52.916 --> 41:55.585
I just wanted to say thank you

41:55.619 --> 41:57.855
for bringing us all
to that diner in Elko

41:57.889 --> 42:00.490
and meeting us there.

42:00.523 --> 42:02.025
-Thanks.
-Of course.

42:02.059 --> 42:05.329
I don't know how you did it.
But I'm so glad you did.

42:05.362 --> 42:09.500
I'm not sure we'd all be here
if you hadn't.

42:09.532 --> 42:12.068
I'm not quite sure
what you're referring to.

42:12.101 --> 42:13.202
Elko?

42:13.237 --> 42:15.106
[Kory] Yes. Nevada.

42:15.139 --> 42:18.041
I'm sorry.
I've never been to Elko.

42:18.076 --> 42:23.076
Perhaps you've confused me
with someone else?

42:23.581 --> 42:25.681
Yeah, perhaps.

42:29.086 --> 42:30.387
[Kory whispering]
That wasn't...

42:30.387 --> 42:32.157
-No way.
-Rachel?

42:32.190 --> 42:36.360
You think Rachel
got in our heads
and sent us a Bruce Wayne?

42:36.393 --> 42:37.762
No.

42:37.795 --> 42:39.998
No way. He was there.
I saw him.

42:40.030 --> 42:42.766
I know. I saw him, too.
But the man's saying
he wasn't there.

42:42.800 --> 42:44.201
You wanna take it up
with Batman?

42:44.233 --> 42:46.771
-No.
-[scoffs]

42:46.804 --> 42:50.273
-My powers go away,
and hers get--
-Get weirder.

42:50.306 --> 42:52.041
Yeah. The fuck is going on?

42:52.074 --> 42:54.025
I don't know.

42:58.916 --> 43:02.652
[Dick clears throat]

43:02.686 --> 43:07.686
Donna Troy and I
were a couple of strays.

43:08.592 --> 43:10.170
Nothing linking us

43:10.170 --> 43:15.195
other than parents
that liked to dress up at night
and fight crime.

43:15.599 --> 43:19.704
She saw us as family.

43:19.737 --> 43:23.775
But I wasn't much interested
in family then.

43:23.807 --> 43:27.177
Families can be fucked up.

43:27.210 --> 43:29.882
I mean, look around.

43:29.914 --> 43:34.914
We've all spent our lives
recovering from the damage
done by our families.

43:37.755 --> 43:41.858
Donna knew something I didn't.

43:41.893 --> 43:43.994
If you throw
enough strays together,

43:44.027 --> 43:46.597
you get the best kind
of family.

43:46.630 --> 43:49.701
One bound not by DNA...

43:49.735 --> 43:54.538
but by a collective sense
of duty and devotion
to another.

43:54.572 --> 43:58.876
And when you lose someone
you love...

43:58.909 --> 44:03.581
you need this.

44:03.614 --> 44:07.213
What we have right here.

44:09.385 --> 44:13.423
What's next for us all?

44:13.456 --> 44:15.407
I don't know.

44:20.164 --> 44:24.802
It's a million-dollar question.

44:24.835 --> 44:29.373
Anyway...

44:29.405 --> 44:31.275
[chuckles]

44:31.307 --> 44:33.744
...to Donna Troy.

44:33.777 --> 44:37.315
Thanks for giving me
a second chance at family.

44:37.349 --> 44:42.152
And thanks to you guys
for taking me back in.

44:42.186 --> 44:43.454
To the Titans.

44:43.487 --> 44:44.856
[all] Titans.

44:44.889 --> 44:49.889
-To Donna Troy.
-[all] Donna Troy.

44:54.132 --> 44:56.666
Ugh, that's what she's been
drinking this whole time?

44:56.701 --> 44:57.934
I think it's great.

44:57.969 --> 44:59.170
-[Kory] I like it.
-No.

44:59.204 --> 45:00.804
-Me too.
-Of course you would say that.

45:00.804 --> 45:01.873
-[Dick] It's a great soda.
-[all laugh]

45:01.873 --> 45:03.141
Yeah, right.

45:03.173 --> 45:05.376
-[Hank] Barf.
-[Dick] Not bad.

45:05.409 --> 45:06.476
So picky.

45:06.510 --> 45:10.414
[cell phone beeping]

45:10.447 --> 45:11.882
[Gar] Guys.

45:11.916 --> 45:14.219
There's cops and the bomb squad

45:14.251 --> 45:17.420
responding to a disturbance
in the Mission District.

45:17.454 --> 45:19.103
Sounds bad.

45:45.682 --> 45:49.282
What are we waiting for?

46:12.376 --> 46:15.376
There's your answer.

46:37.635 --> 46:40.771
[Gar growls]

46:40.804 --> 46:42.454
[dog barks]

46:54.219 --> 46:56.721
[Paris] Good job
cleaning the store, guys.

46:56.753 --> 46:58.655
You did such a good job.

46:58.688 --> 47:01.190
All right. Here we go.

47:01.224 --> 47:04.061
Okay.

47:04.094 --> 47:05.396
[Paris] Here we go.

47:05.429 --> 47:09.800
All right, here we go,
big girl. [grunts]

47:09.833 --> 47:11.001
Let's get you in there.

47:11.034 --> 47:13.204
-[girl talks indistinctly]
-Watch your head.

47:13.237 --> 47:16.907
All right. Now you, princess.

47:16.940 --> 47:20.309
All in? Okay.

47:20.344 --> 47:22.744
Right. Seatbelt.

47:31.722 --> 47:34.572
[grunts] All right.

47:50.108 --> 47:53.677
Hey, lady, your cart. [grunts]

47:53.710 --> 47:55.646
[man groans]
