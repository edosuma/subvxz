00:06.923 --> 00:08.758
[theme music plays]

00:22.480 --> 00:24.441
[Clay] The year is 2161.

00:24.899 --> 00:26.818
Earth is an arid landfill.

00:26.901 --> 00:28.486
Desolate, polluted.

00:28.945 --> 00:30.488
[distorted screeching]

00:30.572 --> 00:31.865
[thrilling music plays]

00:38.913 --> 00:40.040
[screeching]

00:41.416 --> 00:43.960
[Clay] Only a precious few humans
holding on.

00:46.838 --> 00:49.591
The Earth is under attack
from a sentient robot army.

00:53.720 --> 00:57.265
Invaders from the Andromeda galaxy
planet of Rycon Seven.

01:02.687 --> 01:05.190
They're just shooting
that fucking thing everywhere

01:05.273 --> 01:07.317
to see who goes running.
It's really not nice.

01:07.400 --> 01:10.653
-Zymorx, for fuck's sake, get down.
-Why? You don't care if I die.

01:10.737 --> 01:13.740
No, I don't, but if you get scoped
before we're ready to blow back,

01:13.823 --> 01:15.116
you'll get us all killed.

01:25.627 --> 01:28.630
You're not really gonna
take the fight to them, are you, Perce?

01:28.713 --> 01:29.798
'Cause it's suicide.

01:30.215 --> 01:32.008
And what are we down to?

01:32.550 --> 01:33.676
Couple of squads?

01:33.760 --> 01:35.762
So it's suicide, and it's murder.

01:35.845 --> 01:39.099
-The alternative is we wait to die.
-[Zymorx] We're all waiting to die.

01:39.182 --> 01:43.228
The alternative is fall back,
retreat, fight another day.

01:43.311 --> 01:45.855
Yeah, your Ryconian friends
would like that if we ran.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.774
They're not my fucking friends.

01:48.566 --> 01:49.734
Talking about you.

01:50.318 --> 01:51.653
Who are you really fighting?

01:53.196 --> 01:54.447
Set it up, let's go.

02:00.745 --> 02:02.747
[Clay] Zymorx is a sentient robot.

02:02.831 --> 02:03.790
A Ryconian,

02:04.958 --> 02:06.543
but with a manufacturing flaw:

02:07.043 --> 02:09.045
they accidentally made him
with a conscience.

02:10.839 --> 02:12.173
Or so it was said.

02:12.257 --> 02:13.675
Percy never believed it.

02:14.342 --> 02:15.468
You're not cold.

02:16.219 --> 02:17.345
I am lately.

02:18.513 --> 02:20.682
Feel cold. I feel heat.

02:23.226 --> 02:24.144
[Percy] So...

02:24.978 --> 02:25.937
do you miss her?

02:26.855 --> 02:28.815
It's how I know what hurt is. [sighs]

02:33.444 --> 02:34.863
You gonna forgive her?

02:35.321 --> 02:36.322
For leaving?

02:36.906 --> 02:38.700
[motorcycle approaching]

02:40.410 --> 02:41.286
[Zymorx] Hey!

02:41.953 --> 02:43.037
[robotic growling]

02:43.121 --> 02:44.164
Rycon!

02:46.166 --> 02:47.292
[rider sighs]

02:48.168 --> 02:50.712
[rider sighs] Fucking tin cans
blocked up the river,

02:50.795 --> 02:52.797
so I had to go through the shit swamp!

02:54.591 --> 02:56.342
[exhales deeply] Hello, boys.

02:57.385 --> 02:58.344
I'm back.

03:00.388 --> 03:01.389
Astrid.

03:01.472 --> 03:02.515
Oh, thank God.

03:03.725 --> 03:04.934
[interference distorting]

03:05.018 --> 03:07.353
[Clay] The robots harvest
full-grown adults,

03:07.437 --> 03:10.106
so all that's left to fight them
is an army of children.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.524
[man] Please help!

03:12.150 --> 03:15.236
[Clay] Fighting an inhospitable world
that took away their childhood.

03:16.279 --> 03:19.991
We were on the forward line.
Their scout robots are so fucking fast!

03:20.074 --> 03:22.118
[Percy] Fuck! Hey. Get him up! Come on!

03:22.202 --> 03:23.995
-Pull him back. Here we go.
-[coughs]

03:24.078 --> 03:26.664
-Hey, he needs a medic.
-He needs a priest.

03:26.748 --> 03:28.499
Get me a goddamn medic! That's an order!

03:28.583 --> 03:29.584
[sighs]

03:30.585 --> 03:31.836
[pained groaning]

03:31.920 --> 03:33.463
[Percy sighs]

03:34.547 --> 03:38.134
-There is so little we can do.
-I sent him out. I'm not letting him die.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.553
[Clay] Having to become adults
before their time,

03:40.637 --> 03:42.472
-trying to take their world back.
-[coughs]

03:42.597 --> 03:45.433
You're gonna be OK, all right?
You're gonna be OK.

03:45.516 --> 03:48.853
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have sent you out there like that.

03:48.937 --> 03:51.314
-I'm sorry. But I felt like I had to.
-[sighs]

03:52.732 --> 03:55.360
I'm sorry we have to make decisions
like this at all.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.322
[breathing heavily] Hey. Come here.

04:00.740 --> 04:01.824
I'm right here.

04:01.908 --> 04:03.952
[Clay] Sending their friends
into battle...

04:04.035 --> 04:05.119
I'm right here.

04:06.037 --> 04:07.497
...and watching them die.

04:09.582 --> 04:11.125
[electric sparks sizzle]

04:12.877 --> 04:14.796
[distant grinding and rumbling]

04:16.714 --> 04:19.259
-[shotgun cocking, shot reverberating]
-[gasps]

04:22.178 --> 04:25.556
[Clay] I've had some version
of that same dream for days and days.

04:26.557 --> 04:28.434
I've sent a young soldier out to die.

04:28.851 --> 04:30.687
I realize I've done the wrong thing.

04:33.064 --> 04:34.232
[police radio chatter]

04:34.315 --> 04:38.236
[Diaz] So you boys heard there was
an operation, and wanted to warn Tyler?

04:39.529 --> 04:41.281
-Yes, sir.
-That's right.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.909
What led you to believe
Tyler was buying illegal guns?

04:45.785 --> 04:49.539
I found photos of guns in his backpack
during the active shooter drill,

04:49.622 --> 04:52.083
printed from the internet
like he was gonna buy.

04:52.917 --> 04:55.086
I was... scared.

04:55.169 --> 04:57.755
And that was the only reason
you had to suspect him?

04:58.589 --> 04:59.549
It was.

05:02.593 --> 05:06.014
He didn't tell you why you had to
drive him to the station Christmas Eve?

05:06.389 --> 05:09.225
No, but I was worried about him.
He was in trouble.

05:10.643 --> 05:12.395
And you thought you'd warn him.

05:12.478 --> 05:14.605
-[distant siren approaching]
-Yes, sir.

05:15.481 --> 05:16.441
He's our friend.

05:18.943 --> 05:20.820
[Bill] Tyler was an informant,

05:21.612 --> 05:25.283
and he assisted us
with a number of operations.

05:25.366 --> 05:27.201
[door opens, closes]

05:27.577 --> 05:29.787
We traced a bag-load
of illegal guns to him.

05:30.496 --> 05:34.083
Deferred charges in exchange for his help
getting guns like that off the street.

05:34.542 --> 05:35.710
Jesus Christ.

05:35.793 --> 05:38.963
It was Deputy Standall's idea,
and a good one.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.134
Look, Tyler put himself in harm's way
to help us,

05:44.052 --> 05:45.803
and we should be grateful for that.

05:46.262 --> 05:50.725
All of us, our entire community
is safer because of his sacrifice.

05:54.395 --> 05:55.396
Yes, sir.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.774
-Can we talk to him?
-[Diaz] No.

05:58.608 --> 05:59.609
Not just yet.

06:01.277 --> 06:02.904
[Clay] I was dreaming of war,

06:04.113 --> 06:06.449
and then a sort of actual war broke out...

06:06.532 --> 06:07.408
[whooshing]

06:08.034 --> 06:10.745
...at school with everyone.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.458
[Clay] Where've you been?

06:16.417 --> 06:17.418
Jessica's.

06:18.336 --> 06:19.962
-You all right?
-You all right?

06:21.130 --> 06:22.131
Justin...

06:24.467 --> 06:25.676
are you using?

06:28.554 --> 06:29.555
[chuckles lightly]

06:31.349 --> 06:33.351
Clay, man. [inhales sharply]

06:33.684 --> 06:36.354
If I were you,
I'd get my own shit together

06:36.437 --> 06:38.731
before worrying about anyone else.

06:41.859 --> 06:43.361
[door slams closed]

06:43.653 --> 06:46.823
[Clay] Things were just,
like, primed to explode.

06:48.825 --> 06:49.992
And then they did.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.077
[knocking on door]

06:52.412 --> 06:54.747
Hey, baby girl, just checking in.

06:55.915 --> 06:57.417
Any word from Columbia?

06:57.500 --> 06:58.584
Uh, no.

06:59.168 --> 07:03.423
No, I think they really enjoy torturing us
to the very last second.

07:03.840 --> 07:07.135
Yeah, I'm sure it can feel that way.
You got this, honey!

07:07.552 --> 07:11.556
And I was gonna wait,
give this to you later, but...

07:12.974 --> 07:14.434
I think you need it now.

07:15.601 --> 07:17.603
Dad! [chuckles awkwardly]

07:18.229 --> 07:20.648
-[chuckles proudly]
-Thank you.

07:21.774 --> 07:24.527
[Clay] Jessica got rejected
from her top three schools.

07:25.361 --> 07:27.071
-I'll see you tonight.
-See you.

07:29.574 --> 07:31.075
[Clay] It wasn't the interview.

07:31.159 --> 07:34.787
She took her SAT the first time
two days after Bryce got probation,

07:34.871 --> 07:37.540
and she took it the second time
a week after he died.

07:38.833 --> 07:41.294
Even good news about college
can freak people out.

07:41.627 --> 07:42.670
It's the future.

07:43.045 --> 07:44.964
What... What is happening right now?

07:46.215 --> 07:48.134
[Clay] We're all afraid of the future.

07:48.885 --> 07:50.178
[Carolyn giggles]

07:50.928 --> 07:52.847
Well, heaven's sakes, open it!

08:01.397 --> 08:02.315
I got in.

08:02.398 --> 08:05.359
-[Carolyn squeals excitedly, giggles]
-[Bill laughs] Yeah!

08:05.443 --> 08:06.652
[Bill and Carolyn cheer]

08:06.736 --> 08:08.404
That's fantastic, right?

08:08.488 --> 08:09.572
Berkeley!

08:09.655 --> 08:11.908
Yeah. It's... It's great.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.117
I just, uh...

08:14.535 --> 08:16.829
I feel like I shouldn't
let myself get too excited.

08:17.246 --> 08:18.331
What?

08:18.414 --> 08:21.626
[stutters] We'll do whatever we have to.

08:21.709 --> 08:23.711
It's OK to take a few loans!

08:23.794 --> 08:25.755
Yeah, no, I know, it's just...

08:27.381 --> 08:29.509
I mean, you think things are OK at work?

08:30.051 --> 08:32.929
Buddy, things are great at work, OK?
Why wouldn't they be?

08:33.221 --> 08:37.433
Can you honestly tell me
you're not worried about the future?

08:37.934 --> 08:38.976
Look, buddy,

08:40.561 --> 08:42.688
everybody worries about the future,

08:42.772 --> 08:44.899
but everything's gonna be OK.

08:44.982 --> 08:45.983
Trust me?

08:46.567 --> 08:47.401
Yeah.

08:50.780 --> 08:52.031
What's going on?

08:52.406 --> 08:55.660
-Justin got a letter this morning.
-Holy shit! Uh...

08:55.743 --> 08:57.078
I mean, sorry.

08:57.161 --> 08:58.496
-Don't be sorry.
-[giggles]

08:58.579 --> 09:00.414
But please open it, or Lainie will.

09:00.498 --> 09:02.959
It's taken everything in my power
to stop her.

09:05.920 --> 09:06.837
OK.

09:11.634 --> 09:13.511
Uh... "Dear Justin..."

09:15.388 --> 09:17.557
[chuckles incredulously] I... I got in.

09:17.640 --> 09:18.474
[Lainie] Yes!

09:18.558 --> 09:19.892
Way to go, kiddo.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.143
That's fantastic!

09:21.227 --> 09:25.064
[Lainie] We are so happy for you.
You have done so, so well.

09:26.857 --> 09:28.734
And yours is coming, I know it.

09:30.987 --> 09:34.323
And you're doing so great
with Dr. Ellman, and...

09:35.241 --> 09:38.578
We should celebrate, huh?
Medgie's for dinner this weekend?

09:39.495 --> 09:41.998
Or we could treat the boys
to something special?

09:42.707 --> 09:43.541
I, uh...

09:43.624 --> 09:46.377
I hear there's a Gordon Lightfoot concert
coming to town

09:46.460 --> 09:49.046
that all the kids are talking about.
When is that?

09:51.215 --> 09:52.383
[both] Uh...

09:53.342 --> 09:55.928
There is?
I... I'm... I didn't know about that.

09:56.012 --> 09:57.305
That's a great idea.

09:57.388 --> 09:59.682
I'm surprised you guys love him like I do.

10:06.731 --> 10:07.940
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

10:08.941 --> 10:10.901
I didn't hear about that.

10:11.319 --> 10:13.321
[Lainie] No? We'll think of something.

10:13.821 --> 10:14.822
[Matt] Come on, dig in!

10:14.905 --> 10:16.907
-I used a new technique with the eggs.
-[sighs]

10:16.991 --> 10:18.367
It's a touch of cream.

10:20.578 --> 10:22.788
Hey, how do they know
about Gordon Lightfoot?

10:22.872 --> 10:24.832
It's gotta be a coincidence, right?

10:24.915 --> 10:26.542
Maybe he is playing a concert.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.461
When has Gordon Lightfoot
ever played Evergreen?

10:28.544 --> 10:30.129
I don't even know
who Gordon Lightfoot is!

10:30.212 --> 10:32.465
They probably just heard us
using it out loud.

10:32.548 --> 10:35.885
Uh, I mean, they just wanna connect.
They don't know anything,

10:37.094 --> 10:39.680
or they wouldn't be talking to us
about going to college.

10:39.764 --> 10:40.848
You going to college.

10:40.931 --> 10:42.558
You're going to college too.

10:44.185 --> 10:45.102
OK?

10:45.895 --> 10:47.647
Jesus, just chill out.

10:48.731 --> 10:49.732
Let's go.

10:51.901 --> 10:55.571
[Clay] There was this whole feeling
that bad shit was about to happen.

10:56.822 --> 10:58.157
[suspenseful music plays]

10:58.240 --> 11:00.201
[Bryce] I wish you the best, Jess.

11:00.660 --> 11:01.619
Truly.

11:03.663 --> 11:04.580
Goodbye.

11:08.626 --> 11:11.170
It was in the darkroom last night.

11:12.171 --> 11:13.923
Envelope with my name on it.

11:14.382 --> 11:15.758
Was it from Tyler?

11:17.551 --> 11:18.678
I don't know.

11:18.761 --> 11:21.639
Uh, but we don't even know
if Jessica ever heard it, right?

11:22.056 --> 11:23.808
I think she must have,

11:24.934 --> 11:28.270
and she sent Justin to take care of Bryce.

11:28.354 --> 11:29.980
You think she could do that?

11:31.232 --> 11:35.277
Clay and Ani have been fucking with me...

11:35.861 --> 11:38.322
and making Alex break up with me
to cover for her.

11:38.406 --> 11:41.325
No way!
She wouldn't do anything like that.

11:41.742 --> 11:45.538
-I know you think you love her...
-I don't think, I know.

11:46.038 --> 11:49.125
And I know she didn't do
anything like that. Not her.

11:53.087 --> 11:54.088

11:54.171 --> 11:56.465

11:56.549 --> 11:58.217
...and not our hearts.

12:00.136 --> 12:01.470
Is that what you're doing?

12:03.514 --> 12:04.390
I mean,

12:05.266 --> 12:06.976
do you want revenge for Monty...

12:08.769 --> 12:09.645
or for yourself?

12:15.317 --> 12:17.278
[door opens, closes]

12:18.988 --> 12:20.865
[Clay] People's lives are unstable.

12:20.948 --> 12:22.116
Good morning!

12:22.199 --> 12:26.036
Caleb!
I will be out of your hair very soon.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.121
I promise.

12:27.538 --> 12:29.874
First of all, I have very little hair.

12:29.957 --> 12:33.085
And second,
this is your home as long as you need!

12:33.169 --> 12:34.336
That's how we do.

12:34.962 --> 12:37.506
Well, I wish I could earn my keep.

12:37.965 --> 12:40.843
Get that one out of bed and to school
on time, that'd be enough for me.

12:40.926 --> 12:43.554
-[Tony] I'm not a fucking child!
-Then stop acting like one!

12:43.637 --> 12:45.055
[Tony] I have a fight tomorrow!

12:45.139 --> 12:48.142
Because you're a stubborn child
with a fucking death wish!

12:49.351 --> 12:50.853
Seriously, stay.

12:51.270 --> 12:53.230
You're the only one that he listens to.

12:53.814 --> 12:54.774
I'll see you later.

12:54.857 --> 12:55.775
All right.

12:56.901 --> 12:58.611
[door opens, closes]

12:58.694 --> 12:59.987
I'll make breakfast!

13:00.070 --> 13:05.034
Is it a keto day or a no-carb day?

13:05.117 --> 13:07.328
Today is a fasting-till-one day.

13:09.079 --> 13:12.792
-The day before a match, you don't eat?
-I eat a lot, just after one.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.963
Stanford University.

13:19.173 --> 13:20.674
Holy shit, girl!

13:20.758 --> 13:23.427
You must have, like, what,
like, a dozen of these now.

13:23.511 --> 13:24.553
Nine for nine!

13:24.637 --> 13:27.890
And not one of them anything close
to a full ride.

13:28.224 --> 13:29.225
[inhales sharply]

13:30.017 --> 13:31.602
You could take her money.

13:32.061 --> 13:34.021
It would be the most fair thing.

13:34.396 --> 13:35.773
Would you take her money?

13:39.652 --> 13:41.403
I mean, it's not just about me.

13:41.779 --> 13:44.990
You have to stop worrying about them now.

13:45.407 --> 13:49.328
You and me, we do for Clay,
for Jessica, for Alex,

13:49.411 --> 13:51.580
for all of them, without question.

13:52.623 --> 13:55.084
But what happens to them
if the shit comes down?

13:56.502 --> 13:57.837
And what happens to us?

13:58.504 --> 14:00.548
They have parents who are citizens.

14:02.174 --> 14:03.467
It's different for us.

14:05.219 --> 14:06.262
Tell me I'm wrong.

14:07.263 --> 14:08.180
So what?

14:08.806 --> 14:09.932
You drive away?

14:10.349 --> 14:12.101
Leave Clay standing on the curb?

14:14.186 --> 14:15.521
He's your ride-or-die.

14:18.482 --> 14:19.525
I don't know.

14:21.402 --> 14:22.945
He showed up for Tyler, but...

14:27.157 --> 14:28.242
[inhales deeply]

14:29.535 --> 14:30.995
I don't know him anymore.

14:32.162 --> 14:34.164
[ominous music plays]

14:35.332 --> 14:36.792
[distant laugh echoes]

14:36.876 --> 14:39.295
[Clay] The whole school is, like, on edge.

14:39.628 --> 14:41.255
[indistinct chattering]

14:43.382 --> 14:45.175
[Clay] Has been since the lockdown.

14:45.509 --> 14:47.678
[indistinct sounds distort]

14:49.221 --> 14:50.598
-[gunshot]
-[Bolan] No!

14:50.681 --> 14:52.266
[scream echoes]

14:53.893 --> 14:55.102
[breathing heavily]

14:56.478 --> 14:57.605
[Clay] And it feels like

14:57.688 --> 15:00.733
the things that were starting to crack
a little bit before...

15:02.318 --> 15:04.403
are now falling right down on our heads.

15:05.613 --> 15:06.530
Hey.

15:07.573 --> 15:08.782
[Diego sighs]

15:12.369 --> 15:15.080
-Luke saw you with Foley last night.
-[chuckles]

15:15.873 --> 15:17.082
So what?

15:17.166 --> 15:19.543
We hang out a little. We're friends.

15:24.506 --> 15:27.051
[inhales slowly] Why didn't you tell me?

15:28.135 --> 15:29.887
I don't need your permission.

15:33.974 --> 15:36.060
You've been blowing me off. [sighs]

15:37.603 --> 15:39.521
His mom fucking died last week.

15:41.774 --> 15:42.733
Shit. I, um...

15:43.984 --> 15:45.486
I... I didn't know.

15:45.569 --> 15:47.571
I'm just trying to be supportive.

15:49.323 --> 15:51.367
And that's it? Just friends?

15:52.701 --> 15:55.955
You know, because Winston thinks
you've been playing me all along.

15:56.038 --> 15:56.872
[scoffs]

15:56.956 --> 15:59.249
Like maybe we're getting too close
to the truth about Bryce.

15:59.333 --> 16:00.501
That's insane.

16:00.584 --> 16:02.795
Was that the whole reason
you were with me?

16:03.128 --> 16:05.172
You've just been protecting Foley
all along.

16:05.255 --> 16:07.883
He's a friend. He didn't do anything.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.843
He's a fucking junkie, Jess!

16:10.511 --> 16:11.762
A black hole.

16:12.096 --> 16:14.640
I don't wanna see you
get sucked down with him.

16:18.560 --> 16:21.021
Hey, I won't, OK?

16:21.397 --> 16:22.564
I promise.

16:24.024 --> 16:25.025
[Diego sighs]

16:33.534 --> 16:36.912
[Foundry] I don't think you understand
the severity of the situation, Zach.

16:36.996 --> 16:40.874
If you don't get your grades up,
you'll have to repeat senior year.

16:40.958 --> 16:43.377
I know you don't want to be here
longer than you have to.

16:43.460 --> 16:47.506
I don't know. Liberty's a pretty lovely
and idyllic place.

16:47.965 --> 16:50.759
Any kid who can use the word "idyllic"
while being a smart-ass

16:50.843 --> 16:52.219
should not be failing out.

16:52.302 --> 16:53.303
So I don't graduate.

16:54.221 --> 16:55.055
That's OK.

16:55.139 --> 16:56.849
So what's the rest of that plan?

16:56.932 --> 17:00.978
Do you find, in general,
that plans make any difference whatsoever?

17:01.311 --> 17:04.064
-Like, they ever turn out?
-I do.

17:04.481 --> 17:06.108
Sometimes they don't, but...

17:06.608 --> 17:10.112
the only guarantee of failure is
to have no plan at all.

17:10.195 --> 17:11.947
Well, I heard Walplex is hiring,

17:12.448 --> 17:16.118
and there's always one of Evergreen's
many fast-food establishments.

17:16.201 --> 17:17.411
Uh, do you think that...

17:19.121 --> 17:20.581
that I'm management material?

17:22.082 --> 17:24.501
Right, come see me
if you decide to give a shit.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.174
[sighs]

17:39.099 --> 17:41.060
I'll see you at the drive-thru.

17:41.143 --> 17:42.186
Sounds about right.

17:44.563 --> 17:46.356
[Clay] Tyler finally came back to school.

17:47.691 --> 17:49.526
And you'd think that'd be a relief.

17:49.943 --> 17:51.403
It wasn't so much.

17:51.487 --> 17:54.782
Did he know anything about Spring Fling?
Anything at all?

17:55.866 --> 17:56.784
No.

17:58.368 --> 17:59.286
Nothing.

17:59.828 --> 18:02.206
Alex's dad convinced Diaz
that I wasn't violent,

18:02.623 --> 18:04.958
just a misguided kid
who liked guns too much,

18:05.375 --> 18:07.336
and who could help the department.

18:10.589 --> 18:12.591
So where have you been
for the past week?

18:13.383 --> 18:16.804
I had to be deposed
and go in front of a judge in secret.

18:16.887 --> 18:19.348
I needed a break from school...

18:20.015 --> 18:21.058
and from my friends.

18:21.892 --> 18:24.103
-Tyler...
-[Tyler] No, man, I told you.

18:24.186 --> 18:26.647
I told you that
the guns would only trace back to me,

18:26.730 --> 18:30.859
and that everything would be OK.
They wouldn't let me tell you the truth.

18:32.569 --> 18:33.737
We're so sorry.

18:34.238 --> 18:35.614
They dropped my charges.

18:36.365 --> 18:38.408
Seriously, they... they trusted me.

18:38.867 --> 18:40.953
You said from the beginning
if we trusted each other,

18:41.036 --> 18:42.454
everything would be OK.

18:43.038 --> 18:43.914
I did.

18:44.456 --> 18:45.833
Shit got complicated, Ty.

18:45.916 --> 18:48.752
But it's not, actually. It's...

18:50.003 --> 18:53.132
I mean, all you have to do is
have faith in your friends, right?

18:54.216 --> 18:55.551
You two taught me that.

18:56.385 --> 18:57.427
Or did you forget?

19:02.015 --> 19:03.517
[Clay] Tyler was so angry.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.522
But, I mean, everyone was angry.

19:09.606 --> 19:11.733
It was like the fuel waiting for the fire.

19:13.068 --> 19:15.279
Things are only getting worse.

19:15.362 --> 19:19.491
They're putting cameras in locker rooms.
That's gotta be violating some law, right?

19:19.575 --> 19:21.577
-[murmuring]
-Then they'll change the laws.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.453
It's a fucking police state.

19:24.246 --> 19:25.956
Jess, can't you talk to Bolan?

19:31.461 --> 19:34.131
You guys,
I haven't totally been honest with you.

19:38.343 --> 19:40.846
At the beginning of the semester,

19:43.724 --> 19:47.394
Bolan asked me to give him my input
on the security measures...

19:47.477 --> 19:48.478
[gasps]

19:48.562 --> 19:51.982
...and to give him updates
on how people were reacting to everything.

19:52.065 --> 19:54.568
Wait, so you've been helping him?

19:54.651 --> 19:57.404
I just... Look, I wanted to help
make the school safer.

19:57.487 --> 20:01.909
I swear, he never told me about the drill
or... or any of this stuff!

20:01.992 --> 20:03.702
But you've been lying to us.

20:03.785 --> 20:06.747
I'm sure that Jess was just doing
what she thought was best.

20:06.830 --> 20:08.749
It's not... [inhales deeply]

20:08.832 --> 20:12.294
...always easy
to know exactly the right thing to do

20:13.253 --> 20:15.130
when you're trying to protect people.

20:18.425 --> 20:20.761
Is there anything we can do?

20:23.722 --> 20:25.557
I've already tried talking to Bolan.

20:26.350 --> 20:28.143
He doesn't listen to me anymore.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.229
Maybe this is all bigger than us.

20:31.980 --> 20:33.649
Maybe we've got no power here.

20:34.483 --> 20:35.442
Yeah.

20:36.401 --> 20:38.028
Story of my life.

20:40.989 --> 20:42.699
[door opens, closes]

20:46.286 --> 20:49.539
Tony, that guy is a Nazi.

20:49.623 --> 20:51.625
He's got "white power" tattoos.

20:52.042 --> 20:54.336
-So?
-So I feel like he's here to kill you.

20:54.419 --> 20:55.671
So I won't let him.

20:55.754 --> 20:57.089
I don't know, Tony.

20:57.506 --> 21:00.342
I let you host this
so that you can keep an eye on me.

21:00.425 --> 21:02.344
You taught me to fight!

21:03.470 --> 21:05.055
Why don't you want me to fight?

21:06.640 --> 21:09.351
Because I think you're doing it
to get yourself hurt.

21:10.185 --> 21:11.603
What if I'm trying to win?

21:11.687 --> 21:13.855
You have a knockout
and two decisions, Tony.

21:13.939 --> 21:16.024
-Yeah.
-When is it gonna be enough?

21:16.108 --> 21:19.486
[sighs]
I have all of this shit in my life...

21:21.321 --> 21:22.406
that I'm afraid of.

21:23.657 --> 21:25.450
That I can't fight back against.

21:25.909 --> 21:26.868
This...

21:28.704 --> 21:31.540
This is the one fair fight in my life.

21:31.623 --> 21:33.208
What if it isn't fair?

21:33.292 --> 21:35.460
It's fuel to the fire.

21:36.003 --> 21:37.045
[Caleb] Is it?

21:37.504 --> 21:40.882
Or is it one more secret
that you're carrying alone?

21:43.385 --> 21:44.303
[clicks tongue]

21:45.846 --> 21:48.390
[referee] OK, gentlemen, come on in.
Let's go.

21:50.183 --> 21:52.477
All right, I want a good, clean fight.

21:52.978 --> 21:53.979
You got it?

21:54.896 --> 21:55.772
You got it?

21:56.106 --> 21:57.316
All right, touch gloves.

21:57.649 --> 21:59.901
Fucking faggot! You die today.

22:00.694 --> 22:02.279
Back to your corners. Let's go.

22:02.863 --> 22:05.157
-[bell dings]
-[crowd yells encouragement]

22:05.574 --> 22:07.284
[Tony groans, grunts]

22:13.665 --> 22:14.708
Go back!

22:17.294 --> 22:18.295
[pained groaning]

22:33.643 --> 22:34.603
Hey, hi.

22:35.187 --> 22:36.021
Uh...

22:38.690 --> 22:40.317
You're supposed to be at work.

22:40.859 --> 22:44.529
They... But they told me
that you don't work there anymore?

22:47.407 --> 22:48.617
Quit.

22:48.700 --> 22:50.827
They also told me you got fired.

22:55.916 --> 22:56.958
Justin...

22:59.127 --> 23:01.421
Yeah, whatever.
[chuckles, inhales sharply]

23:06.009 --> 23:08.261
I saw you with Diego today.

23:11.348 --> 23:12.599
In study hall.

23:17.020 --> 23:18.814
You actually like him. [chuckles]

23:19.815 --> 23:20.941
That's bullshit.

23:21.024 --> 23:22.109
Tell me you don't.

23:26.571 --> 23:28.240
'Cause I can... I can see it.

23:32.202 --> 23:35.622
Think he's, like, hot, or whatever,
and I'm a fucking mess. [laughs]

23:35.705 --> 23:38.333
I don't fucking think that at all, Justin!

23:38.417 --> 23:39.793
Well, I am.

23:42.796 --> 23:44.756
And I'm not gonna get better, so...

23:47.342 --> 23:48.218
So...

23:50.137 --> 23:52.764
Better to be with him than to, um...
[clicks tongue]

23:54.683 --> 23:57.185
...sit around and wait for me to OD.

23:57.853 --> 23:58.979
[chuckles]

23:59.062 --> 24:00.897
So don't OD!

24:04.151 --> 24:04.985
Get...

24:07.237 --> 24:08.363
Get the fuck...

24:09.573 --> 24:10.574
outta here.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.202
OK?

24:17.497 --> 24:19.291
I didn't ask you to come looking for me.

24:19.374 --> 24:22.377
I came to the fucking alley
for a fucking reason.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.257
I'll always come looking for you.

24:27.883 --> 24:29.468
[exhales slowly]

24:32.471 --> 24:34.055
That's fucking pathetic.

24:42.189 --> 24:43.023
Go.

24:43.106 --> 24:43.940
No.

24:45.150 --> 24:45.984
Go!

24:47.486 --> 24:48.403
Go, Jess.

24:48.487 --> 24:50.197
Go fuck Diego!

24:51.865 --> 24:52.991
[Jess sobs lightly]

24:54.493 --> 24:55.452
Go!

25:00.499 --> 25:01.917
[Jess continues sobbing]

25:02.209 --> 25:05.086
[exhales slowly]

25:13.970 --> 25:16.932
Remember what you're fighting for!
Remember it!

25:17.015 --> 25:20.268
[Clay] Because, like, there comes a time
when enough is enough...

25:20.352 --> 25:22.270
[coach] This is where you get up!

25:22.354 --> 25:27.192
[Clay] ...and you have to stand up
and face up and fight back.

25:27.275 --> 25:28.860
[coach shouts encouragement]

25:28.944 --> 25:29.945
This is it!

25:30.278 --> 25:32.781
[referee] All right. Look at me!

25:33.782 --> 25:35.617
-You all right? Can you go?
-[grunts]

25:35.700 --> 25:38.745
-All right, let's go. Fight!
-[coach] Take it to him, Tony!

25:38.828 --> 25:39.996
Take it to him!

25:42.457 --> 25:45.085
[boxer grunts]

25:46.711 --> 25:47.712
[boxer groans]

25:48.421 --> 25:50.340
[crowd whistles, shouts encouragement]

25:56.429 --> 25:58.014
-Yes!
-That's it!

26:00.225 --> 26:01.351
[bell dings]

26:01.434 --> 26:03.436
[crowd cheers]

26:06.648 --> 26:08.066
-I love you.
-I love you.

26:11.903 --> 26:13.572
-[Caleb] You did it!
-I love you.

26:14.322 --> 26:16.074
-I need to not get hit as much.
-Yeah, you do!

26:16.157 --> 26:16.992
Tony!

26:17.367 --> 26:19.411
Hi, great fight.

26:20.453 --> 26:22.581
-Thank you.
-Listen, my name is Jack Ross.

26:22.664 --> 26:25.625
I'm the assistant boxing coach
at the University of Nevada.

26:26.126 --> 26:28.962
We've seen you fight a couple times now.
Are your folks around?

26:30.213 --> 26:32.048
Uh... they don't live here.

26:32.132 --> 26:35.635
I'd love to meet them sometime.
We'd like to offer you a scholarship.

26:38.179 --> 26:39.806
-For fighting?
-[Ross chuckles]

26:39.889 --> 26:42.976
Yes, sir. Now, I know right now,
you gotta get a shower, get a meal,

26:43.059 --> 26:44.603
but give me a call.

26:45.186 --> 26:46.605
I'm in town for another day.

26:50.108 --> 26:51.443
Well, how about that?

26:52.986 --> 26:54.154
-Uh...
-[chuckles]

26:56.489 --> 26:57.907
I'm not saying I don't care,

26:57.991 --> 27:00.201
I'm saying I don't know
if now is the best time

27:00.285 --> 27:03.038
-to be going to some stupid--
-[Lainie] It's not stupid!

27:03.121 --> 27:05.874
And we made a commitment to do this,
for them.

27:05.957 --> 27:08.460
Is it for them, though?
Or is it really just for us?

27:09.836 --> 27:11.171
[Lainie sighs] Um...

27:11.796 --> 27:13.256
You wanted to see us?

27:13.340 --> 27:17.385
Yes, uh,
we are on our way out for date night.

27:20.930 --> 27:23.850
Why so many date nights lately?

27:23.933 --> 27:25.935
And... and what commitment did you make?

27:26.645 --> 27:29.064
Oh, we're committed
to keeping the romance alive.

27:29.522 --> 27:31.066
Here is some money for pizza.

27:31.608 --> 27:35.028
And we are actually running late,
so be good.

27:35.904 --> 27:37.739
-Yeah, you too!
-[door opens, closes]

27:38.615 --> 27:39.741
That was weird, right?

27:39.824 --> 27:42.827
They're probably going to a weird meeting
of their sex cult.

27:43.370 --> 27:46.790
Dude, why would you put that in my brain?

27:46.873 --> 27:48.833
Sorry, it's date night. [snickering]

27:49.584 --> 27:51.461
They've been on
a half dozen dates this year

27:51.544 --> 27:53.338
and never look
like they're enjoying them.

27:53.421 --> 27:55.215
Maybe that's why they keep going.

27:55.757 --> 27:58.385
Maybe it's to keep the magic alive,
you know?

27:58.468 --> 28:00.387
Oh, my God, dude, I'm just saying,

28:01.012 --> 28:02.472
maybe it's not a date at all.

28:02.555 --> 28:04.307
[suspenseful music plays]

28:18.947 --> 28:20.490
[door opens, closes]

28:26.788 --> 28:28.415
[indistinct chattering]

28:39.634 --> 28:42.387
[Foundry] And thanks
to all of your incredible support

28:42.470 --> 28:46.891
and fundraising over this past semester,
we've had tremendous success

28:46.975 --> 28:49.602
with a number of new,
innovative security practices.

28:50.228 --> 28:51.187
Thank you.

28:51.938 --> 28:56.025
Tonight's focus
is on your kids' online lives.

28:56.109 --> 29:01.865
We know many of you have downloaded
Dave's apps to read emails and texts,

29:01.948 --> 29:04.993
follow online activity,
geotrack your kids,

29:05.076 --> 29:09.205
but if you don't have the apps yet,
uh, just talk to Dave after our session.

29:09.289 --> 29:12.417
And, uh, he can also, uh,
link you into their laptops,

29:12.500 --> 29:14.502
webcams, solutions for your home.

29:15.086 --> 29:16.212
Anything you need.

29:17.172 --> 29:19.090
What's really great about these apps

29:19.174 --> 29:22.552
is Dave and his team
can aggregate the data,

29:22.635 --> 29:26.139
which will keep us apprised
of trending topics,

29:26.765 --> 29:28.183
hot button issues.

29:28.516 --> 29:31.144
Really, everything that your kids
communicate about.

29:31.227 --> 29:33.354
Of course, we recently completed

29:33.438 --> 29:36.566
a successful active-shooter drill
here on campus,

29:36.649 --> 29:39.486
which has, uh, made us more prepared

29:39.569 --> 29:43.239
to respond quickly and effectively
in an emergency.

29:45.116 --> 29:47.035
-[Matt clears throat]
-Yes, question.

29:47.118 --> 29:50.538
Yeah, uh, that drill gave my son
a nervous breakdown.

29:50.622 --> 29:52.624
How can you say it was successful?

29:52.707 --> 29:56.503
No, there were a small number of students
who were upset by the drill,

29:56.586 --> 29:58.463
and we did have follow-up counseling.

29:58.546 --> 30:01.549
He wasn't just upset! He ended up
in a psych ward, pissing his bed!

30:01.633 --> 30:02.592
-[Lainie] Honey!
-Well...

30:02.675 --> 30:04.385
He wouldn't want us sharing that.

30:04.928 --> 30:07.347
[Foundry] We weren't gonna do questions
until the end.

30:11.643 --> 30:16.314
So, they had a parent meeting.
I really don't think it's such a big deal.

30:18.358 --> 30:20.235
They have complete access.

30:20.568 --> 30:23.822
They've been watching everything we do,
tracking every move we make.

30:24.197 --> 30:27.659
If all they know is that we've been
talking about Gordon Lightfoot,

30:27.742 --> 30:29.536
how much do they actually know?

30:29.619 --> 30:31.496
Look, I don't think
they've cracked the code yet,

30:31.579 --> 30:33.915
but they have a fucking security team
working on it.

30:33.998 --> 30:36.084
They could be listening right now
for all we know!

30:36.584 --> 30:39.712
-Clay, I think you're being paranoid.
-I think you're being stupid!

30:41.214 --> 30:44.050
Look, you escaped from a mental hospital.

30:44.133 --> 30:46.302
How do you expect anyone to trust you?

30:46.386 --> 30:49.097
You're still with Diego.
How do we trust you?

30:49.973 --> 30:51.975
You're the one who wanted to meet.

30:52.851 --> 30:57.313
Look, we have to get everyone together,
or you do.

30:57.397 --> 30:58.690
[Jess] Who's left?

30:59.399 --> 31:01.734
Justin's not speaking to me, Zach's done.

31:02.485 --> 31:04.821
I mean, Alex? Ani?

31:04.904 --> 31:08.575
Ani moved out,
and she's been meeting with Miss Walker.

31:09.617 --> 31:10.702
Alex saw her.

31:11.995 --> 31:12.954
[Clay scoffs]

31:15.206 --> 31:16.541
We are so fucked.

31:18.543 --> 31:20.295
[Caleb] And everything is paid for?

31:20.378 --> 31:21.921
Here's the offer letter.

31:22.005 --> 31:25.216
Full tuition, housing, meals,
and a stipend for expenses.

31:25.300 --> 31:27.093
[door opens, closes]

31:27.760 --> 31:28.761
Tony!

31:29.262 --> 31:32.056
-Tony, Coach Ross was just--
-Coach Ross was just leaving.

31:33.266 --> 31:36.227
-Tony, maybe I can talk you through--
-There's nothing to talk through.

31:37.729 --> 31:39.731
I have responsibilities here.

31:42.025 --> 31:43.192
I can't go to Nevada.

31:43.276 --> 31:44.944
If he could have more time
to think about--

31:45.028 --> 31:47.947
-I don't need to think about it! I--
-[Ross] Of course!

31:48.781 --> 31:49.782
Talk it over.

31:50.408 --> 31:52.410
The offer holds for 30 days.

31:53.786 --> 31:54.662
Thank you.

31:58.875 --> 32:01.002
I'm sorry to have wasted your time.

32:06.883 --> 32:08.885
It's a real pleasure
watching you fight, Tony.

32:09.510 --> 32:12.305
I hope you'll continue fighting
in the right rings.

32:15.892 --> 32:16.935
[door closes]

32:20.396 --> 32:24.651
So, wait, is this for real,
or is it just Clay being crazy?

32:24.734 --> 32:26.569
It was a parent meeting.

32:26.653 --> 32:28.780
Yours were there, my dad was there.

32:29.822 --> 32:31.991
Clay says that they have everything.

32:32.075 --> 32:32.992
[Alex] Jesus.

32:33.493 --> 32:34.452
Fuck. Um...

32:35.119 --> 32:37.497
I heard Diaz talking to my dad
the other day,

32:37.580 --> 32:39.749
and it sounded like
he's gonna reopen the case.

32:41.292 --> 32:42.877
Why didn't you say anything?

32:42.961 --> 32:44.462
I'm saying something now.

32:44.754 --> 32:46.881
Maybe Clay's right.
Maybe we should call a meeting.

32:46.965 --> 32:50.635
I tried. Turns out I've pissed off
everyone in my life,

32:50.718 --> 32:52.720
so I guess this is the meeting.

32:54.764 --> 32:56.516
Well, makes sense.

32:56.599 --> 32:58.267
It always has been you and me.

33:00.728 --> 33:01.980
What should we do?

33:04.273 --> 33:05.108
I don't know.

33:12.323 --> 33:14.867
You know, I couldn't figure it out.

33:16.285 --> 33:18.246
Jess choosing you over me.

33:21.082 --> 33:22.041
I mean...

33:23.126 --> 33:25.044
you're a joke on the field,

33:25.878 --> 33:28.256
you're obviously a shit boyfriend.

33:30.800 --> 33:32.635
So what does she see in you?

33:33.636 --> 33:34.554
Really?

33:34.637 --> 33:36.931
Um, I don't really have time
for this shit right now.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.349
But then I heard the tape.

33:42.228 --> 33:43.229
What tape?

33:44.230 --> 33:46.232
That Bryce made for her.

33:47.108 --> 33:49.068
She's protecting you, isn't she?

33:50.695 --> 33:52.030
Because you did it.

33:53.114 --> 33:54.115
You killed him.

33:59.370 --> 34:01.914
You really don't know
what the fuck you're talking about.

34:03.708 --> 34:04.959
But if I were you,

34:05.668 --> 34:07.503
I'd keep my fucking mouth shut.

34:10.048 --> 34:11.382
I'm gonna get the truth.

34:12.467 --> 34:13.926
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

34:14.844 --> 34:16.971
How, exactly?

34:21.809 --> 34:23.770
I'll beat the shit out of you
if I have to.

34:24.395 --> 34:27.899
Though, something tells me you won't last
as long as your boy Zach did.

34:29.150 --> 34:30.193
[chuckles lightly]

34:30.777 --> 34:32.320
[tense music plays]

34:39.410 --> 34:41.454
[both grunt]

34:42.330 --> 34:44.999
Hey! Enough! That's enough, break it up!

34:45.083 --> 34:47.251
You, back to class.
You, up against the locker!

34:47.335 --> 34:49.295
-Me? Why just me?
-I said up against the locker!

34:49.378 --> 34:51.005
What the fuck, man? We were just talking!

34:51.089 --> 34:52.715
-I said back to class!
-What the hell?

34:52.799 --> 34:54.842
Another fucking Mexican kid
starting a fight?

34:54.926 --> 34:57.261
-I'm Dominican. What the fuck?
-You can't say shit like that.

34:57.345 --> 34:59.055
-Get off him!
-Back off! Hey!

34:59.138 --> 35:00.681
[students gasping]

35:01.182 --> 35:03.434
-[screaming]
-[Diego] Oh, shit! Don't shoot! Please!

35:03.518 --> 35:05.144
Put the gun away.
I'll do what you want.

35:05.228 --> 35:06.729
Back up. Back the fuck up!

35:07.188 --> 35:10.691
Up against the locker!
Against the locker, hands spread.

35:15.822 --> 35:17.031
[panicked gasping]

35:17.115 --> 35:19.492
Come on. He didn't do anything, man.
Let him go!

35:20.076 --> 35:23.246
-[yelling] Let him go!
-Hey, what the fuck?

35:23.329 --> 35:24.413
[Jess] Hey!

35:24.497 --> 35:26.082
-[Justin] Jesus!
-[Jess] What the fuck?

35:26.916 --> 35:28.960
[students exclaiming]

35:29.043 --> 35:32.463
Oh, this is fucking unbelievable.
This is fucking typical.

35:35.174 --> 35:36.384
[boy] They don't care!

35:42.849 --> 35:45.351
There are innocent people
being treated like criminals.

35:45.434 --> 35:47.019
I'm told they were fighting.

35:47.103 --> 35:48.855
Oh, that's bullshit!

35:48.938 --> 35:51.232
And it's not just them, it's all of us!

35:51.315 --> 35:54.026
-[students] Yeah!
-[Jess] Presumed guilty? No charge?

35:54.110 --> 35:55.653
No due process?

35:55.736 --> 35:57.446
[Bolan] All right, people. Folks!

35:57.530 --> 35:59.699
-[whistling, applause]
-[Bolan] Hey, please.

35:59.782 --> 36:01.742
The situation is being addressed.

36:01.826 --> 36:03.411
Let's get back to class.

36:03.494 --> 36:04.871
[students murmuring]

36:04.954 --> 36:05.913
No!

36:06.330 --> 36:08.374
Do not make matters worse.

36:08.875 --> 36:10.376
Get back to class.

36:11.169 --> 36:14.046
No. We're not going back to class.

36:14.130 --> 36:18.843
Clay, I promise you we will get into this.

36:18.926 --> 36:20.386
Diego's being released,

36:20.469 --> 36:23.347
the officer will be disciplined
if appropriate...

36:23.431 --> 36:24.724
[students booing]

36:24.807 --> 36:28.227
...and we will address the situation
according to--

36:28.311 --> 36:31.731
-Fuck that! Enough is enough!
-[students shout agreement]

36:32.273 --> 36:33.191
Fucking right.

36:33.274 --> 36:37.028
All right, I understand your point
without all the inappropriate language.

36:37.111 --> 36:38.529
Fuck you, motherfucker.

36:38.613 --> 36:40.323
[students exclaiming]

36:41.032 --> 36:42.200
We're together on this.

36:42.283 --> 36:45.161
Everyone get back to class right now,

36:45.828 --> 36:47.872
or there will be consequences.

36:47.955 --> 36:48.956
Bring it on.

36:49.457 --> 36:50.541
We're not afraid.

36:50.666 --> 36:52.251
[rousing music plays]

36:53.544 --> 36:55.171
We're finally doing something.

36:56.214 --> 36:58.090
Doing what, exactly?

37:13.856 --> 37:15.858
[students laugh, murmur approval]

37:15.942 --> 37:16.817
[Bolan] Hey.

37:17.985 --> 37:19.111
[stuttering] Turn around.

37:19.612 --> 37:20.947
No. [stutters]

[Ellman] And the police never found out
who destroyed the principal's car?

50:12.342 --> 50:13.301
No.

50:16.722 --> 50:20.392
Clay, you've told me a number of times
that I'm the only person in your life

50:20.475 --> 50:22.728
that you can be completely honest with
right now.

50:23.311 --> 50:24.563
Is that still true?

50:25.731 --> 50:26.648
Um...

50:28.108 --> 50:29.359
Totally, yeah.

50:31.153 --> 50:32.988
Principal Bolan reached out to me.

50:35.532 --> 50:37.909
Before he decides on discipline,

50:39.369 --> 50:41.329
he wanted to know about your progress.

50:43.290 --> 50:44.583
Your state of mind.

50:46.043 --> 50:50.172
I can speak to him in a limited way
about our work...

50:51.131 --> 50:52.549
if you give me permission.

50:56.720 --> 50:57.804
He showed me this.

51:14.988 --> 51:16.114
[Clay] What the hell?

51:18.033 --> 51:20.452
[Ellman] If you tell me
you don't remember that,

51:21.078 --> 51:22.621
if you look me in the eye...

51:24.247 --> 51:25.248
and tell me,

51:26.625 --> 51:27.793
I'll believe you.

51:30.170 --> 51:31.963
[ominous music plays]

51:33.632 --> 51:34.883
I don't remember...

51:36.343 --> 51:37.260
at all.

51:41.181 --> 51:42.265

51:45.268 --> 51:46.978
Then we have a problem here.

51:52.776 --> 51:53.735
[Clay] The fuck?

51:54.236 --> 51:55.362
[Alex] Who did this?

51:55.445 --> 51:56.696
[Jess] No fucking idea.

52:02.911 --> 52:04.871
-[screeching]
-[Jess] Fuck off, asshole!

52:05.288 --> 52:06.790
We're scared enough!

52:09.251 --> 52:11.628
[Foundry] Anything you want to tell me
about the cameras?

52:12.170 --> 52:13.672
Who might've seen fit to destroy them?

52:15.799 --> 52:17.259
Fire! Fire!

52:31.982 --> 52:33.024
[breathing heavily]

52:33.108 --> 52:34.401
I, uh...

52:36.820 --> 52:37.863
I... It...

52:38.155 --> 52:42.450
I think you've been keeping secrets
from everyone, from me,

52:43.660 --> 52:45.203
and most damaging,

52:46.413 --> 52:47.581
from yourself.

52:48.415 --> 52:49.291
[whispers] Yes.

52:52.002 --> 52:54.379
[Ellman] Are you ready
to let those secrets out?
