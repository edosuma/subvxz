00:31.197 --> 00:33.950
Hello, Commander Kelly. I'm your daughter.

00:35.201 --> 00:37.245
Hello, Grant, I'm your daughter.

00:40.331 --> 00:42.667
Hello, I'm your… daughter.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.869
<i>Cabin pressure equalized.</i>

01:47.816 --> 01:49.192
Okay. Wake…

01:54.781 --> 01:56.741
<i>Fortuna</i>
<i>wake sequence initiated.</i>

01:59.953 --> 02:01.663
<i>Wake sequence malfunction.</i>

02:01.746 --> 02:03.873
No! No, no, no, no, no!

02:04.666 --> 02:06.334
<i>Heart rate decreasing.</i>

02:08.503 --> 02:10.338
<i>Blood oxygen levels falling.</i>

02:14.384 --> 02:16.761
<i>Pulmonary response suboptimal.</i>

02:19.264 --> 02:20.140
Okay.

02:22.016 --> 02:22.892
Defibrillator.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.354
Where's the defibrillator?

02:29.023 --> 02:30.358
Okay. Find a solution.

02:30.441 --> 02:32.193
<i>Cortisol spiking.</i>

02:32.861 --> 02:34.195
Okay, okay. Okay…

02:38.658 --> 02:40.618
<i>Capillary response declining.</i>

02:55.300 --> 02:56.301
I got you.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.146
Come on.

03:09.272 --> 03:11.441
<i>Vital signs stabilizing.</i>

03:13.318 --> 03:14.235
Hi.

03:15.403 --> 03:16.529
Who are you?

03:16.613 --> 03:17.614
Oh, I'm…

03:18.114 --> 03:19.157
Um…

03:19.240 --> 03:20.658
Mr. Kelly, I'm…

03:23.995 --> 03:25.163
I'm an astronaut.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.461
Okay, I signed up to help,

04:55.545 --> 04:58.006
but I feel like I should know
what I signed up for,

04:58.089 --> 05:01.050
because I'm pretty sure
I need to write a report about all this.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.594
So, if you guys want me
to make you look good--

05:03.678 --> 05:07.557
You'd rather stay on a ring of Jupiters
with a resting temperature of 106 degrees?

05:07.640 --> 05:10.518
John Robinson. One demerit.
Problem with authority.

05:10.601 --> 05:12.478
The only way we can get to Alpha Centauri

05:12.562 --> 05:14.814
is with an alien engine
and a robot to operate it.

05:14.897 --> 05:16.774
And currently, we have neither,

05:16.858 --> 05:19.569
because the danger of acquiring one
is insurmountable.

05:19.652 --> 05:22.905
Let me guess.
You found a way to make it mountable.

05:24.032 --> 05:26.367
-That sounded dirtier than I wanted.
-So, new plan.

05:26.868 --> 05:29.245
Instead of taking the risk
of capturing a live robot,

05:29.329 --> 05:31.748
we're gonna use the parts
of a destroyed one and reboot it.

05:32.415 --> 05:35.543
Are you talking about the robots
that blew up in the Resolute?

05:35.626 --> 05:39.088
How can we possibly find
every single part of one specific robot?

05:39.172 --> 05:43.134
Every part we need
is in one place on this planet,

05:43.676 --> 05:46.137
outside a cave, under a tarp,

05:46.220 --> 05:48.473
right where Adler and I left it.

05:51.434 --> 05:54.979
It's the one that Will called SAR,
for Second Alien Robot.

05:55.063 --> 05:58.191
Only your son would name something
that was trying to kill him.

05:59.150 --> 06:02.028
Okay, best case scenario,

06:02.111 --> 06:05.823
which I know isn't a thing with you guys,
but let's say it was.

06:05.907 --> 06:08.743
Even if this works,
we still need an engine.

06:09.327 --> 06:11.537
I think the fact
that we've got a robot of our own

06:11.621 --> 06:13.748
will make it
a heck of a lot easier, don't you?

06:14.540 --> 06:16.334
The storm will give us some cover.

06:16.417 --> 06:19.045
-But we're gonna have to be quick.
-Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

06:19.712 --> 06:21.464
What if we put it back together

06:21.547 --> 06:24.509
and, I don't know,
it decides it doesn't wanna help us?

06:26.969 --> 06:28.596
Then we don't give it a choice.

06:37.814 --> 06:40.316
…pretty sure he came back here,
I mean…

06:40.400 --> 06:43.444
Hey, you, pigtails, load those carefully.

06:43.528 --> 06:44.862
<i>Oui, madame.</i>

06:44.946 --> 06:48.199
Make sure your little friends know
that if anything of mine gets broken,

06:48.282 --> 06:50.284
-I will be handing out detention.

06:50.368 --> 06:53.538
Is detention really a threat
when you're stranded on an alien planet?

06:53.621 --> 06:54.872
The power of words.

06:55.373 --> 06:58.209
You're not the only one
who's afraid of danger, Will Robinson.

06:58.876 --> 07:01.170
It's nice to see you back at work,
by the way.

07:01.712 --> 07:04.757
Speaking of which, I notice
you came down the wall one sister short.

07:04.841 --> 07:08.010
-Judy will be back soon.
-Yeah, but with how many passengers?

07:08.803 --> 07:11.889
I'm just curious,
since she's very particular about her math

07:11.973 --> 07:14.308
and how much air we'll have
in our Jupiter.

07:14.392 --> 07:17.937
Adding an extra adult astronaut
might complicate things.

07:18.521 --> 07:20.314
Let's focus on getting the ship
ready to leave

07:20.398 --> 07:22.316
before we worry about who's on board.

07:24.152 --> 07:26.237
Is there anything I can do to help?

07:29.365 --> 07:30.408
Um…

07:32.034 --> 07:35.037
-You can let me know if you see Robot.
-He's missing?

07:35.746 --> 07:37.582
He wanders off sometimes. Just…

07:38.541 --> 07:42.170
-…not usually for this long.
-How long has he been gone for?

07:42.253 --> 07:44.839
-Since last night.
-You think something's happened to him?

07:45.840 --> 07:47.884
He's a seven-foot-tall, 400-pound robot.

07:47.967 --> 07:50.178
There's probably not much here
that can hurt him.

07:50.261 --> 07:52.555
Well, maybe not here, where we've settled.

07:53.973 --> 07:57.310
But there's a whole planet
we haven't explored.

07:58.269 --> 07:59.770
If he's wandered off far,

08:01.481 --> 08:03.065
who knows what's out there?

08:03.774 --> 08:07.069
Are you sure this missing Robot
story isn't just some elaborate ruse

08:07.153 --> 08:09.363
to get me alone and far away from camp?

08:09.447 --> 08:12.366
Are you inferring I have to trick you
into spending time with me?

08:12.867 --> 08:15.912
No, it's just…
we've been looking for a long time.

08:15.995 --> 08:18.372
He's kind of the most important person
on the planet.

08:18.456 --> 08:19.707
More important than me?

08:19.790 --> 08:21.709
Unless you can open up a rift in space,

08:21.792 --> 08:24.170
I'm gonna say, yeah,
Robot's more important than you.

08:25.254 --> 08:27.465
Okay, um… serious question.

08:28.799 --> 08:32.803
I know we're getting out of here soon, but
aren't you gonna miss this place a little?

08:33.304 --> 08:37.934
No rules? Things will just be different
when we get back to Alpha Centauri,

08:38.017 --> 08:39.310
and everything's back to normal.

08:40.603 --> 08:43.481
Just because we get back to Alpha Centauri
doesn't mean it'll be normal.

08:43.564 --> 08:47.026
Okay? There's nothing normal
about 97 kids without their parents.

08:47.818 --> 08:48.653
Yeah.

08:50.279 --> 08:51.656
Sorry. I, um…

08:54.617 --> 08:56.035
When we separated,

08:56.577 --> 08:58.788
I thought it was just gonna be
a few months

08:58.871 --> 09:01.332
'cause my mom
always has an answer to everything,

09:01.832 --> 09:03.084
but it's been a year.

09:05.253 --> 09:07.046
So I don't know if they're, um…

09:08.130 --> 09:12.635
Hey. I know there's nothing I can do
to make those questions go away,

09:14.053 --> 09:16.722
but, um, maybe I can
take your mind off them.

09:24.480 --> 09:25.773
-What?

09:25.856 --> 09:26.899
-Your--
-What?

09:26.983 --> 09:29.318
-…hair is, uh…

09:30.361 --> 09:32.446
-Wh--
-What?

09:34.574 --> 09:35.575
Will!

09:36.867 --> 09:37.743
Will!

09:38.244 --> 09:40.246
How did they decide who gets to go?

09:40.955 --> 09:42.748
Was there a-- a lottery or a--

09:42.832 --> 09:47.295
Uh… sort of, but you had to take
a series of tests in order to qualify.

09:48.045 --> 09:52.592
So, now thousands of people
are living on Alpha Centauri.

09:55.344 --> 09:56.637
And you're a captain.

09:58.180 --> 10:00.391
-I'm sorry. It's just that you're--
-Young.

10:00.474 --> 10:02.810
-Very.
-Well, since you're gonna meet them,

10:02.893 --> 10:05.688
you should know
that my crew is mostly children.

10:05.771 --> 10:06.731
Children?

10:07.732 --> 10:09.692
Yep, 97 of them.

10:10.401 --> 10:12.695
Why would you bring children
on a rescue mission?

10:15.156 --> 10:16.157
Oh.

10:16.991 --> 10:19.410
You weren't actually
looking for us, were you?

10:20.536 --> 10:23.623
Our Colonist Group
ran into a little bit of trouble.

10:23.706 --> 10:25.374
It's complicated, but…

10:26.917 --> 10:28.044
rest assured,

10:28.753 --> 10:31.130
we are more than capable enough
to handle this.

10:31.213 --> 10:33.215
If you knew everything we'd been through--

10:33.299 --> 10:34.467
Look, Robinson,

10:35.217 --> 10:37.845
in the last 30 minutes,
I learned that I lost my crewmate,

10:37.928 --> 10:40.765
my ship, damn near 20 years of my life.

10:41.891 --> 10:46.020
Maybe we should just cool it
on any other… news for a bit.

10:48.773 --> 10:50.816
Yeah. Yeah, I agree.

10:50.900 --> 10:51.901
I-- I…

10:53.903 --> 10:56.489
Let's just focus
on getting you back on your feet.

11:01.786 --> 11:03.788
One thing I am curious about, though.

11:04.705 --> 11:07.625
If you weren't trying to find me,
how is it you know so much about me?

11:07.708 --> 11:11.587
Um… You're…
You're pretty famous back on Earth.

11:12.171 --> 11:16.717
In fact, when I was in school,
I-- I did a little report on you.

11:17.968 --> 11:18.928
Is that right?

11:20.471 --> 11:22.890
I always wondered
what it would be like to meet you.

11:26.936 --> 11:29.855
Well, I can't wait to see your ship.

11:30.856 --> 11:33.359
NASA must have made
some pretty impressive advances

11:33.442 --> 11:35.903
to get you to travel this far, this fast.

11:36.570 --> 11:39.281
-Mm. We've had a little bit of help.
-From who?

11:39.365 --> 11:41.450
Russians? Chinese?

11:42.785 --> 11:43.828
A robot.

11:46.580 --> 11:47.540
Okay.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.459
On the count of three. Ready?

11:50.543 --> 11:51.419
Yeah.

11:52.378 --> 11:56.006
One, two, three.

11:59.135 --> 12:01.846
Oh! Just like on the Resolute.

12:01.929 --> 12:05.099
Yeah, but we're not on the Resolute,
so why is it happening here?

12:05.182 --> 12:07.727
You know, your mother and I--

12:09.019 --> 12:11.564
once experienced the same phenomenon.

12:11.647 --> 12:12.523
You followed me here?

12:12.606 --> 12:15.860
Honestly, if I'd known it'd been this far,
I wouldn't have.

12:15.943 --> 12:19.655
but it's a good thing I did,
because I know what this hair thing means.

12:19.739 --> 12:23.868
Somewhere on the other side
of that wall is…

12:23.951 --> 12:26.787
-…alien technology.
-Alien technology. We know.

12:27.371 --> 12:28.789
That's not possible.

12:28.873 --> 12:30.207
We would have seen a sign,

12:30.291 --> 12:32.460
or the robot
would have said something, or--

12:34.920 --> 12:35.921
What is that?

12:37.798 --> 12:40.217
Some kind of… tunnel.

12:41.969 --> 12:43.345
Cool. Yeah.

12:43.429 --> 12:46.474
So I agree with whoever suggested
we just cover this up

12:46.557 --> 12:48.350
and pretend we were never here.

12:48.434 --> 12:50.936
-No one suggested that, Penny.
-Well, they should have.

12:51.020 --> 12:55.232
Do either of you think it's a coincidence
we found this the day Robot goes missing?

12:56.150 --> 12:58.068
There's only one way to know for sure.

13:01.197 --> 13:02.531
Someone has to go in.

13:04.909 --> 13:08.078
You really think it's a good idea
to bring a robot back from the dead?

13:08.162 --> 13:09.830
Haven't you guys read <i>Pet Sematary?</i>

13:09.914 --> 13:12.291
This is as far as we can go
on the Chariot.

13:12.374 --> 13:14.210
We're gonna have to travel
the rest by foot.

13:14.293 --> 13:16.420
Okay, Don, that's us. Let's gear up.

13:16.504 --> 13:19.089
Can I just suggest, once again,
my original plan,

13:19.173 --> 13:22.843
which is me staying here
and Maureen can go out with you? You--

13:22.927 --> 13:25.179
Maureen''s the only one
who knows what we're lookin' for.

13:25.262 --> 13:27.431
We'll be pretty much blind out there.

13:27.515 --> 13:30.059
She'll be monitoring
both our cameras from in here.

13:30.142 --> 13:32.728
Okay, but if we end up
with a robot zombie on our hands,

13:32.812 --> 13:35.272
I want it on the record
that it was Admiral Don West--

13:35.356 --> 13:36.690
You're not an admiral, Don.

13:36.774 --> 13:39.235
-Brigadier Don West--
-No.

13:39.318 --> 13:41.904
-Ready?
-Sure! So excited.

13:53.749 --> 13:57.169
I'll find us a spot in the shade,
set up a picnic. It'll be great.

13:57.253 --> 14:00.548
Did you bring the pomegranate juice,
or was that my responsibility?

14:00.631 --> 14:03.133
I never remember,
'cause I did mango last time.

14:03.217 --> 14:04.426
Well, see you both soon.

14:11.308 --> 14:14.854
Okay, I'm reading you both.
Keep straight ahead.

14:14.937 --> 14:17.147
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>ground's a little unsteady here.</i>

14:17.231 --> 14:20.693
<i>-Don, watch your feet.</i>
<i>I can't even see my feet.</i>

14:21.652 --> 14:24.572
-Fade 20 degrees to your right.

14:24.655 --> 14:26.115
<i>Right 20.</i>

14:26.198 --> 14:28.826
Don? Don, you're a little loose.
Tighten up.

14:28.909 --> 14:32.288
<i>This is disorienting.</i>
<i>Is John to my left or my right?</i>

14:32.371 --> 14:33.414
Left.

14:33.497 --> 14:35.708
<i>Don, just look for my light.</i>

14:35.791 --> 14:37.501
-<i>Okay--</i>

14:39.086 --> 14:39.962
Don?

14:42.464 --> 14:44.008
His picture cut out.

14:44.091 --> 14:44.925
Don!

14:46.051 --> 14:47.344
<i>Can you hear him?</i>

14:49.096 --> 14:50.514
His audio cut out too.

14:51.015 --> 14:53.517
-<i>Don?</i>

14:53.601 --> 14:55.686
<i>Don? I-- I barely--</i>

14:58.188 --> 15:01.108
<i>Wait, I think I see something out there.</i>

15:01.692 --> 15:03.193
John. John, be careful.

15:03.777 --> 15:04.737
<i>Don?</i>

15:07.323 --> 15:08.616
<i>-Wait.</i>

15:09.992 --> 15:10.910
<i>I don't like this.</i>

15:13.787 --> 15:15.122
<i>I-- I think I'm gonna--</i>

15:16.624 --> 15:18.417
-John!

15:20.920 --> 15:23.464
<i>-Oops! Sorry about that.</i>
-Oh-- Oh, God.

15:23.547 --> 15:26.175
<i>What's goin' on?</i>
<i>There's nobody answering me.</i>

15:26.759 --> 15:28.594
<i> Hey, I thought we lost ya.</i>

15:28.677 --> 15:29.762
Okay.

15:30.554 --> 15:31.472
John, wait.

15:31.555 --> 15:33.682
-Turn back to your left.
<i>-Yeah.</i>

15:35.059 --> 15:36.936
There! Right ahead of you.

15:37.019 --> 15:39.146
<i>Yeah. Yeah, I got it. I see it.</i>

15:41.690 --> 15:44.985
<i>There's, uh… there's nothing here.</i>

15:45.569 --> 15:48.656
Just keep digging. Maybe--
Maybe it's been buried by all the…

15:48.739 --> 15:50.741
<i> Uh, there's nothing.</i>
<i>It's just solid--</i>

15:52.451 --> 15:56.288
<i>If SAR's not here, where the hell is it?</i>

16:00.042 --> 16:03.754
Sure it's a good idea to have both
acting cocaptains here at the same time?

16:03.837 --> 16:06.715
This is exactly the kind of thing
captains are supposed to do.

16:07.257 --> 16:08.133
Really?

16:08.926 --> 16:11.887
I thought it was more about
ordering people around and pointing.

16:12.471 --> 16:13.806
Just relax.

16:15.349 --> 16:18.435
Feels like
we're walking in poo.

16:19.103 --> 16:21.230
It's just mud built up on the ground.

16:21.772 --> 16:22.898
We're gonna be fine.

16:22.982 --> 16:26.485
I'd like to take a second to remind you
the last time I was stuck in a tunnel,

16:26.568 --> 16:29.530
I was drooled on by a bat monster
that wanted to eat my face.

16:32.533 --> 16:33.534
Smith?

16:36.370 --> 16:38.122
Smith, are you still there?

16:38.205 --> 16:39.373
Of course!

16:39.873 --> 16:42.793
-You sure we're doing this right?
-Absolutely!

16:42.876 --> 16:44.211
In the Girl Scouts,

16:44.294 --> 16:47.381
this is how we kept track of each other
on nature hikes.

16:47.464 --> 16:50.467
Once you're out of earshot,
if anything goes wrong,

16:50.551 --> 16:53.470
just tug on the line,
and I'll know you need help.

16:53.554 --> 16:55.389
You were in the Girl Scouts?

16:55.472 --> 16:57.182
Is that so hard to believe?

16:57.266 --> 17:00.019
Okay, then answer me this.

17:00.102 --> 17:03.022
Do you have any Thin Mints?

17:03.105 --> 17:05.315
-Penny!
-What?

17:05.399 --> 17:07.443
You know cookies help me when I'm nervous.

17:07.526 --> 17:08.402
Just come on.

17:10.154 --> 17:13.449
Just keep going.
I'll be here the whole time.

17:29.339 --> 17:30.299
Robot?

17:31.884 --> 17:32.926
Are you here?

17:44.188 --> 17:45.064
Whoa.

17:45.689 --> 17:46.523
What?

17:53.947 --> 17:54.990
Footprints.

17:55.824 --> 17:56.658
Yeah.

17:57.493 --> 18:00.746
It-- It looks like
they could belong to an alien robot.

18:03.123 --> 18:05.751
Okay, uh… Yeah, so that's my cue.

18:05.834 --> 18:08.295
I just think that
we should get out of here.

18:08.378 --> 18:10.214
-Whoa!

18:12.341 --> 18:13.884
Penny! Will!

18:14.468 --> 18:15.636
No, no, no.

18:15.719 --> 18:17.471
-What happened?
-I don't know.

18:17.554 --> 18:20.599
I just hit, like, a button
or a switch or something.

18:20.682 --> 18:22.601
I don't know, maybe if I hit it again?

18:25.104 --> 18:27.106
Um… Smith!

18:28.023 --> 18:29.483
Smith, help!

18:30.025 --> 18:31.026
It's okay, right?

18:31.110 --> 18:34.071
Smith is outside, and she knows
where we are, and she can help us.

18:34.154 --> 18:36.031
Yeah. Yeah.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.200
-Yeah. Of course she will.

18:41.620 --> 18:44.414
-Will, these prints look really fresh.
-I don't know.

18:45.666 --> 18:48.752
It's a cold, damp room.
No light, little airflow.

18:49.461 --> 18:51.672
It's the perfect conditions
for preservation.

18:51.755 --> 18:54.591
-Wh-- which means what?
-Which means they could be old.

18:54.675 --> 18:58.178
Buzz Aldrin's boot prints are still on
the moon because there's no atmosphere--

18:58.262 --> 19:00.556
I appreciate
you're using history and science

19:00.639 --> 19:04.059
to try and bore me into submission, but…

19:05.310 --> 19:08.021
Listen, Will,
I saw the robots on the Resolute.

19:09.064 --> 19:10.274
They know your name.

19:11.191 --> 19:13.694
So if they're here somewhere,
you're in serious danger,

19:13.777 --> 19:15.028
and we both know that.

19:15.112 --> 19:17.948
So, please, just be honest with me.
Could these be recent?

19:23.162 --> 19:24.079
Yeah.

19:25.247 --> 19:26.707
Yeah, it's-- it's possible.

19:32.462 --> 19:35.507
Uh… believe it or not,
back in the day, this was cool.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.843
-No, some people still think they are.
-Hmm.

19:37.926 --> 19:41.471
My little brother wore one on
our last Halloween before we left Earth.

19:42.931 --> 19:44.892
-Where you going?
-Come this way.

19:45.726 --> 19:48.145
If the crew's wake systems
were compromised like mine,

19:48.228 --> 19:49.730
we can't risk triggering them.

19:49.813 --> 19:53.066
And it's not like we can
walk the pods back to your camp, so--

19:54.693 --> 19:56.820
Seriously?
This has been on ice for 20 years.

19:56.904 --> 19:58.238
Yeah, well, so have I.

19:58.322 --> 20:01.325
Right, which is why I wouldn't strap
800 pounds to your back

20:01.408 --> 20:03.827
and ride you across a meteor minefield.

20:03.911 --> 20:05.913
Odd metaphor, but okay.

20:09.583 --> 20:10.959
Here's the thing.

20:11.043 --> 20:14.213
You said the launch window off this planet
won't hold for much longer.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.006
So the question is,

20:16.590 --> 20:19.551
do you wanna walk back,
or do you wanna ride?

20:37.986 --> 20:41.323
-Is everything all right?
-Oh, yeah. Sorry.

20:42.241 --> 20:46.161
Shen. He and Faith, the woman
you saw on the Fortuna, they were…

20:47.371 --> 20:50.499
You know, when you train
for a deep-space mission like ours,

20:50.582 --> 20:52.000
people can get close.

20:55.837 --> 20:58.257
-Can I ask you a question?
-Yep.

20:58.840 --> 21:00.926
When you made the decision to leave Earth,

21:01.009 --> 21:05.514
was there… was there anything
that was hard to leave behind?

21:06.348 --> 21:08.308
You know, anything that you miss?

21:08.392 --> 21:11.019
Part of the job was teaching yourself
not to miss anything.

21:12.312 --> 21:15.107
It was the farthest space travel
anyone had ever attempted.

21:15.774 --> 21:19.861
For our mental health, we had to commit
to leaving everything and everyone behind.

21:21.905 --> 21:23.448
Okay, that's not totally true.

21:24.032 --> 21:27.452
There was something from back home
I thought about all the time…

21:29.496 --> 21:32.791
the rocky road ice cream
at McConnell's in Pasadena.

21:37.170 --> 21:40.173
-The one across from the bookstore.
-You know it?

21:40.257 --> 21:42.676
Yeah, my mom
used to take us there all the time.

21:45.637 --> 21:48.849
-Rocky road was actually also my favorite.
-Hmm.

21:49.391 --> 21:50.642
Small world.

21:50.726 --> 21:52.477
Yeah.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.105
Better get movin' before the meteors do.

21:59.860 --> 22:02.112
<i>Alert.</i>
<i>Depressurizing cabin.</i>

22:16.335 --> 22:18.295
I thought these suits
are supposed to be airtight.

22:18.378 --> 22:21.757
I got sand in places where it's not
supposed to be without my permission.

22:21.840 --> 22:24.718
It's okay.
We'll go back, get reinforcements.

22:24.801 --> 22:28.013
We'll get enough people and equipment
to capture one of those robots.

22:28.096 --> 22:31.683
I'm not worried about that right now.
I am worried about our son.

22:31.767 --> 22:35.228
I'm worried about all our kids,
but right now, we need to focus on how--

22:35.312 --> 22:39.274
John, you weren't there in that cave.
That robot, it-- it wanted Will.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.986
It was-- it was like it was personal.

22:44.196 --> 22:47.491
If SAR is back,
he'll find a way to get to Will.

23:07.844 --> 23:10.389
-Will, what is it?
-Something strange.

23:11.598 --> 23:14.101
I actually don't think
these were made by the robots.

23:14.184 --> 23:15.310
What do you mean?

23:15.394 --> 23:19.022
These prints have chitinous striations
and textured joints.

23:19.523 --> 23:23.151
They're shaped like the alien robots,
but-- but they weren't made by metal.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.612
They're organic.

23:26.196 --> 23:28.365
Then, if the robots didn't make those,
who did?

23:30.659 --> 23:33.370
Penny? Will?

23:37.207 --> 23:42.045
If you want me to stay out here
where it's safe, just say nothing!

23:46.591 --> 23:47.801
Smith!

23:50.011 --> 23:53.723
I mean, we just walked into a dark tunnel,
with no idea what was inside.

23:53.807 --> 23:56.393
How stupid do we have to be?

24:00.480 --> 24:03.024
Sometimes you have
to walk into dark places.

24:05.235 --> 24:07.237
-Sometimes you don't have a choice.

24:07.320 --> 24:08.613
There's always a choice.

24:08.697 --> 24:11.575
Not if it's the only way
to protect the people you love.

24:12.742 --> 24:15.454
-That's what Mom and Dad would do.

24:15.537 --> 24:17.998
Will, Mom and Dad aren't here, okay?

24:18.081 --> 24:21.126
And neither is Don, and neither is Judy.

24:21.209 --> 24:24.087
She's on the surface,
and I don't even know if she's okay.

24:24.171 --> 24:25.672
We don't even know…

24:26.673 --> 24:28.675
And me saying this right now
is reminding me

24:28.758 --> 24:32.345
that I'm a really crappy older sister
because I'm supposed to be comforting you.

24:39.436 --> 24:40.770
Why aren't you scared?

24:41.980 --> 24:43.106
Who says I'm not?

24:43.815 --> 24:45.942
Then why don't you ever talk about it?

24:50.947 --> 24:52.365
Oh, Will, what is that?

25:00.665 --> 25:01.583
Sorry I'm late.

25:01.666 --> 25:04.211
-No way was I coming in here unarmed.

25:07.464 --> 25:08.507
Robot!

25:10.175 --> 25:11.718
Are you okay? Where'd you go?

25:11.801 --> 25:14.596
Really? Isn't he the one
who's supposed to be rescuing you?

25:16.139 --> 25:19.476
I think he wants us to follow him. Why?

25:20.060 --> 25:21.603
Danger, family.

25:35.158 --> 25:38.411
So, you've been gone
for almost two years now.

25:39.412 --> 25:41.206
Any idea what's goin' on back on Earth?

25:41.289 --> 25:43.667
Maybe a way to contact someone back home?

25:43.750 --> 25:45.460
No. Unfortunately, no.

25:46.211 --> 25:47.045
Why?

25:47.128 --> 25:48.088
My mom,

25:48.797 --> 25:50.382
she'd be almost 80 by now.

25:50.465 --> 25:53.718
She was always worried
about me going into space.

25:53.802 --> 25:55.720
Can't wait for that big "told you so."

25:58.932 --> 26:00.058
What about your parents?

26:00.141 --> 26:02.894
Um, my parents are in space.
They're headed to the colony.

26:02.978 --> 26:04.396
-At least, I think--

26:04.479 --> 26:06.314
-Whoa! Feel that?

26:06.398 --> 26:08.400
-Yeah.
-Felt like it's somewhere close.

26:08.483 --> 26:10.360
I could almost feel it in my stomach.

26:14.447 --> 26:16.366
-No!
-What are you doing?

26:16.449 --> 26:18.159
One of the pods got loose.

26:19.202 --> 26:21.830
Just keep moving. I got this.

26:21.913 --> 26:23.790
-Be careful.

26:34.050 --> 26:37.178
-How you doin' back there?
-Just keep driving.

26:43.101 --> 26:44.311
Whoa!

26:50.233 --> 26:51.484
Hold on! I got you!

27:04.539 --> 27:06.541
Judy!

27:06.625 --> 27:09.169
I know.

27:19.763 --> 27:22.515
-You need to buckle up now!

27:39.282 --> 27:42.494
-Where did you learn to drive like that?
-Actually, my mom.

27:43.953 --> 27:46.998
-Where'd you learn to be so brave?
-I guess…

27:49.542 --> 27:50.502
…my dad.

27:53.171 --> 27:55.173
The sandstorm's starting to die down.

27:55.256 --> 27:58.218
Its kinetic energy
won't be masking us much longer.

27:58.718 --> 28:00.804
Hey, Don, let's start powering down

28:00.887 --> 28:03.640
in case any of those robots
are patrolling the area.

28:03.723 --> 28:06.142
Listen, the most important thing
we can do right now

28:06.685 --> 28:08.645
is find out if SAR is functional again.

28:08.728 --> 28:11.314
Well, even if he is,
even if he's here on this planet,

28:11.398 --> 28:14.150
it doesn't matter because Will isn't,
which means he's safe.

28:14.234 --> 28:16.152
-All the kids are.
-Are they?

28:16.903 --> 28:20.782
I mean, I know we've spent the last year
telling ourselves that they are, but…

28:21.950 --> 28:22.992
what if they're not?

28:23.993 --> 28:24.828
Hey.

28:26.413 --> 28:29.749
It's-- it's the not knowing.
It's the hardest part.

28:30.417 --> 28:33.378
Hey, guys. Were these marks here before?

28:44.889 --> 28:47.475
-There's something on the ship.

29:14.502 --> 29:16.296
What is he looking for?

29:16.379 --> 29:18.757
I don't think
he's looking for anything.

29:19.466 --> 29:21.384
I think he wants to show us something.

29:22.177 --> 29:24.304
Well, I really hope
it's the way out.

29:38.151 --> 29:39.194
Incredible.

29:41.488 --> 29:42.864
Is this where you're from?

29:46.201 --> 29:48.578
He looks like he's trying to remember.

29:50.830 --> 29:52.957
Do you think whoever made this place

29:53.917 --> 29:54.751
made you?

29:56.085 --> 29:58.463
Yes, Will Robinson.

29:59.088 --> 30:02.091
More importantly, are they still here?

30:04.469 --> 30:05.303
No.

30:05.386 --> 30:07.514
Does that make you sad?

30:08.139 --> 30:11.476
Just because someone made you,
doesn't mean you're sad when they're gone.

30:12.018 --> 30:13.978
Sometimes, you're better off without them.

30:14.062 --> 30:17.357
Not everyone can have parents
like John and Maureen Robinson.

30:20.568 --> 30:25.156
Yeah, maybe robots and humans
aren't so different after all.

30:25.240 --> 30:28.284
Both only as good
as the ones who programmed us.

30:29.494 --> 30:32.997
But we can break our programming.
I mean, look at Robot.

30:34.916 --> 30:35.750
Look at you.

30:36.334 --> 30:38.962
That's sweet, but at the end of the day,

30:39.045 --> 30:40.463
I fear we are…

30:41.798 --> 30:43.550
who we were built to be.

30:48.680 --> 30:50.807
Hey. Hey, where you going?

30:51.349 --> 30:53.059
Help family.

30:55.728 --> 30:58.022
Uh… our family or his?

31:13.580 --> 31:16.374
-What are you doing?
-You said we needed a robot.

31:16.457 --> 31:19.127
Yeah. To be fair,
she says a lot of crazy things.

31:19.210 --> 31:23.047
Your plan can still work.
All the parts are in one place.

31:23.131 --> 31:26.718
Only difference is,
that place is on our ship.

31:27.677 --> 31:29.971
That's not the only difference.

31:30.805 --> 31:33.975
This robot is alive
and could kill you, John.

31:34.058 --> 31:35.560
Yeah, it's also alone.

31:36.352 --> 31:39.397
If we were ever gonna get a chance
of capturing one of 'em alive,

31:39.480 --> 31:42.275
of ever seeing our kids again, this is it.

31:56.039 --> 31:56.998
Wow.

31:57.790 --> 31:59.334
Why'd you bring us here?

32:00.001 --> 32:01.711
Danger, family.

32:02.962 --> 32:05.632
You keep saying that,
but we don't know what you mean.

32:06.591 --> 32:07.759
Danger from what?

32:36.829 --> 32:38.164
-Shh!

33:12.865 --> 33:13.992
The Danger System.

33:25.336 --> 33:26.879
Is that the Jupiter 2?

33:28.006 --> 33:30.675
Our parents. Is that who's in danger?

33:36.431 --> 33:38.057
Are you looking for my son?

33:43.730 --> 33:46.607
Who is that? What is that?

33:47.191 --> 33:48.401
Danger.

33:48.484 --> 33:50.653
Why would you show us this
if we can't help?

33:55.825 --> 33:56.659
Come on.

33:59.579 --> 34:02.665
-Help family, Will Robinson.
-I don't know how!

34:11.841 --> 34:13.801
-We have to do something!
-I-- I'm trying!

34:16.471 --> 34:17.638
Help family.

34:17.722 --> 34:18.681
Mom!

34:19.390 --> 34:20.725
Dad! Mom!

34:21.976 --> 34:22.935
<i>Dad!</i>

34:23.019 --> 34:24.896
-John, wait!
-No, this is our one shot!

34:24.979 --> 34:25.980
-<i>Mom!</i>
-Will!

34:26.731 --> 34:28.775
<i>Will?</i>

34:28.858 --> 34:30.568
What's happening?

34:37.909 --> 34:38.993
Scarecrow.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.205
John, stand down. I--

34:43.372 --> 34:44.665
I-- I think it's okay.

34:45.333 --> 34:46.876
Mom? Mom, is that you?

34:49.545 --> 34:51.047
This is some kind of trick.

34:51.130 --> 34:52.882
Dad! Dad, I can hear you too!

34:53.466 --> 34:54.300
Will?

34:55.093 --> 34:59.180
Will, I-- I don't know what's happening,
but we're talking to you through a robot.

34:59.847 --> 35:02.058
I think it's Scarecrow.

35:02.141 --> 35:04.435
<i>Will, did you send him to us?</i>

35:06.270 --> 35:07.230
No.

35:08.606 --> 35:09.440
Robot did.

35:09.524 --> 35:12.110
We were about to defend ourselves.

35:12.193 --> 35:14.737
<i>-If you hadn't stopped us--</i>
-That's what danger was.

35:15.321 --> 35:17.657
They didn't understand
that you were trying to help.

35:17.740 --> 35:19.367
Penny-- Penny, is that you?

35:19.450 --> 35:22.078
-Yeah. Mom. Yeah. Hi, it's me.
-<i>Oh, my God!</i>

35:22.161 --> 35:23.663
We miss you so much!

35:23.746 --> 35:24.747
I miss you too.

35:24.831 --> 35:26.624
<i>Guess what. I read your book.</i>

35:26.707 --> 35:29.377
Uh, four, five times already, and…

35:30.461 --> 35:33.589
Oh, all I've wanted every day

35:33.673 --> 35:38.761
is just to tell you how brilliant it is
and how brilliant you are.

36:13.421 --> 36:17.049
Penn, Will,
it's so good to hear your voices.

36:17.133 --> 36:18.176
<i>How's Jude?</i>

36:18.801 --> 36:19.719
She's fine.

36:20.219 --> 36:21.220
Is she with you?

36:22.138 --> 36:23.389
Uh…

36:23.472 --> 36:25.558
No. No, she's…

36:27.101 --> 36:29.187
-she's busy.
-Uh, busy captaining.

36:30.188 --> 36:32.481
You know, heavy is the head
that wears, um…

36:33.649 --> 36:35.026
whatever captains wear.

36:36.527 --> 36:37.820
How's Alpha Centauri?

36:38.321 --> 36:40.615
Well, don't freak out,

36:40.698 --> 36:42.491
but we're not quite there yet.

36:42.575 --> 36:45.036
-What?
No, we're fine. We're fine. We just…

36:45.119 --> 36:46.662
we just got a bit sidetracked.

36:46.746 --> 36:47.830
What? For a year?

36:47.914 --> 36:50.750
It's fine. I was sidetracked
for most of my 20s.

36:51.250 --> 36:54.795
We had to repair one of our thrusters,
but we should be there in a couple days.

36:55.379 --> 36:56.797
<i>What about you guys?</i>

36:57.882 --> 36:59.383
-We, uh…

37:00.301 --> 37:02.595
We need two things
to get to Alpha Centauri,

37:02.678 --> 37:04.263
and now we have one of them.

37:04.347 --> 37:07.099
Well, he's on our ship.
I don't know whether we have him.

37:07.183 --> 37:08.768
Help friend.

37:08.851 --> 37:09.852
Help family.

37:09.936 --> 37:12.146
I think Robot's saying
you can help each other.

37:12.230 --> 37:13.439
Will, you're breaking up.

37:13.522 --> 37:15.691
-Same here.
-<i>Will, I need you to listen.</i>

37:15.775 --> 37:17.235
When you get to Alpha Centauri,

37:17.318 --> 37:20.446
you need to turn that engine off
so no one can find you.

37:20.529 --> 37:22.240
<i>-Okay?</i>
-That was always the plan.

37:22.323 --> 37:25.910
I know. I know, but now it is--
it is more important than ever.

37:26.535 --> 37:28.746
<i>SAR might be alive.</i>

37:31.999 --> 37:33.834
Mom? Mom?

37:33.918 --> 37:36.879
Mom, can you hear me? I love you--

37:40.424 --> 37:42.885
They're okay. They're okay!

37:45.096 --> 37:45.972
They are.

37:47.223 --> 37:48.099
They are.

37:48.933 --> 37:50.476
Oh, man!

37:51.352 --> 37:54.689
So, what do we do about this guy?

37:55.648 --> 37:56.899
We get to work.

38:00.736 --> 38:02.947
I thought you said
getting across the surface

38:03.030 --> 38:03.948
was the hard part.

38:04.532 --> 38:05.574
Yeah, it was.

38:06.951 --> 38:09.078
We're a two-mile vertical drop
from your camp.

38:09.161 --> 38:11.372
Unless you have
one hell of an airbag there,

38:11.455 --> 38:14.000
-this is officially the hard part.
-Don't worry.

38:14.792 --> 38:16.627
Every problem has a solution.

38:17.211 --> 38:18.879
Wait, what did you just say?

38:19.505 --> 38:23.592
Nothing. It's just…
something my mom always says.

38:24.427 --> 38:28.347
I used to know a woman
who used that phrase a lot too.

38:31.726 --> 38:33.477
There's something I have to tell you.

38:34.103 --> 38:37.815
I know you said that-- that maybe
you don't want any more news today,

38:37.898 --> 38:41.610
but I think you deserve to know
the reason why I chose you

38:41.694 --> 38:43.404
to do my report on back in school.

38:45.197 --> 38:49.952
The assignment was to talk about
somebody that was a hero to us,

38:50.036 --> 38:53.247
and I couldn't decide between two people.

38:53.331 --> 38:56.876
One was my father, a Navy SEAL

38:56.959 --> 39:02.048
and probably the bravest and best dad
that I could ever ask for,

39:02.131 --> 39:06.886
and… and the second was
someone that I never met

39:07.511 --> 39:10.389
but was kind of always a part of my life.

39:10.973 --> 39:13.476
His mother would come over
every Thanksgiving, and…

39:15.519 --> 39:17.021
she was there that day

39:17.730 --> 39:19.148
that I gave that report.

39:20.316 --> 39:22.693
My mom worked with him at NASA,

39:24.111 --> 39:27.615
and… when she would talk about him,

39:27.698 --> 39:32.078
she would say that…
that he gave his life to space.

39:32.703 --> 39:36.957
But… that he gave her life something more.

39:39.877 --> 39:41.003
He gave her me.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.384
And he never knew that I existed,

39:47.385 --> 39:52.390
and… I never referred to him as my father

39:52.473 --> 39:56.394
because, well, that job was already taken,

39:56.477 --> 39:59.897
but I always wondered what he would say
if he got to hear this story.

40:08.155 --> 40:09.115
I think…

40:10.157 --> 40:12.535
he would start by saying,
"Nice to meet you."

40:21.710 --> 40:22.962
Nice to meet you too.

40:34.348 --> 40:37.893
Come on! We have to go back to camp,
tell everyone the good news.

40:37.977 --> 40:39.520
Okay, I'll be right there.

40:49.905 --> 40:53.576
I noticed you didn't mention
to your parents that I was still alive.

40:53.659 --> 40:56.871
No offense, but there were
more important things to talk about.

40:58.998 --> 41:02.543
I have another theory.
I think you were being a protector.

41:03.794 --> 41:06.881
Protecting me from getting in trouble
for being a stowaway

41:06.964 --> 41:08.591
and protecting your parents

41:08.674 --> 41:11.635
so they wouldn't worry about the fact
that you were alone with me.

41:11.719 --> 41:13.053
Interesting theory.

41:13.137 --> 41:15.264
You're a good person, Will Robinson.

41:15.931 --> 41:20.478
Even being on your own this past year,
the values your parents instilled in you,

41:21.395 --> 41:23.606
your original programming,

41:24.899 --> 41:26.025
it stuck with you.

41:29.028 --> 41:31.363
I guess it's a good thing
we didn't take off sooner.

41:32.031 --> 41:33.240
What do you mean?

41:33.324 --> 41:36.368
Well, if we hadn't been stranded here
for so long,

41:36.452 --> 41:38.579
we never would have found this place,

41:38.662 --> 41:41.499
and you never would have connected
with your parents.

41:42.666 --> 41:45.002
Sometimes, things work out for the best.

41:53.719 --> 41:58.557
So, finding Scarecrow to help my parents,

42:00.518 --> 42:02.228
was that your way of saying sorry?

42:05.564 --> 42:06.649
Well, either way,

42:08.150 --> 42:09.109
thank you.

42:11.403 --> 42:12.488
What's out there?

42:39.390 --> 42:40.724
The other robots,

42:42.268 --> 42:44.353
do they know what happened to this place?

42:46.897 --> 42:48.607
That whoever made them is…

42:50.985 --> 42:51.944
extinct?

42:52.027 --> 42:54.363
No, Will Robinson.

42:56.198 --> 42:57.866
Then that's how we end this.

42:59.034 --> 43:02.162
When the robots attacked us,
it's not what they wanted to do.

43:02.246 --> 43:04.665
It's what they were programmed to do.

43:05.332 --> 43:09.003
Those orders, their original programming,

43:09.086 --> 43:10.462
it's obsolete now.

43:13.382 --> 43:15.301
We have to find a way to prove it to them.

43:16.176 --> 43:18.554
Danger, Will Robinson.

43:20.055 --> 43:21.682
You're thinking about SAR.

43:27.271 --> 43:28.939
Do you think he'll remember me?

44:09.229 --> 44:12.566
Find Will Robinson.
