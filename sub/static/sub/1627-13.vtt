NARRATOR:
Once upon a time, an evil queen

00:04.714 --> 00:09.504
banished every storybook character
you’ve ever known to our world.

00:09.594 --> 00:13.382
Who knows the truth
and who can break the spell?

00:13.472 --> 00:14.552
You don't play with the curse.

00:15.892 --> 00:17.598
-My book.
-Why did you bury it here?

00:17.685 --> 00:18.765
So my mom doesn't find it.

00:18.853 --> 00:20.764
When people are supposed to be
together, they find a way.

00:20.897 --> 00:23.138
DAVID: The reason / go to Granny’s
is to see you.

00:23.232 --> 00:24.517
GEORGE: You’re gonna tell him
you don ’t love him.

00:24.734 --> 00:26.565
-Or you'll kill me.
-|'|| kill him.

00:26.652 --> 00:28.563
H EN RY: My book! It’s gone!

00:55.431 --> 00:59.470
Princess Abigail, your beauty grows
with each passing day.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.643
It is an honor
to have you join my family.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.436
Thank you, Your Majesty.

01:04.523 --> 01:06.809
MAN: Let's go!
(SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY)

01:07.109 --> 01:08.394
Is everything okay?

01:09.153 --> 01:10.814
Just excitement at the royal wedding.

01:11.239 --> 01:15.608
We want to ensure the safety of
our guests. 80 if you'll excuse me...

01:17.119 --> 01:18.529

02:33.821 --> 02:35.812
Chicken's delicious.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.446
David, there's something
we need to discuss.

02:43.456 --> 02:44.696
Okay.

02:46.292 --> 02:48.032
I applied to law school.

02:49.628 --> 02:52.870
That's amazing.
Why didn't you ever tell me?

02:53.466 --> 02:58.051
I don't know. Maybe because
I didn't think I could actually do it.

02:58.346 --> 03:03.136
But I did. I got this today.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.216
Igot in.

03:06.437 --> 03:09.725
It's in Boston.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.391
I know things have been
hard between us.

03:14.487 --> 03:17.229
But maybe a fresh start
is what we need.

03:17.656 --> 03:20.648
Maybe we've been fighting too hard to
recapture old memories

03:20.785 --> 03:24.027
when we should have been
making new ones instead.

03:31.420 --> 03:34.127
Who are you?
What are you waiting for?

03:34.882 --> 03:35.962
Do you think I fear you?

03:36.675 --> 03:37.801
(GRUNTS)

03:41.389 --> 03:42.378
Abigail? (PANTING)

03:44.058 --> 03:45.138
What are you doing here?

03:45.226 --> 03:48.468
I wanted to get my hands on you
before your father ripped you to shreds.

03:48.562 --> 03:49.677
How did you know I was going to be...

03:49.772 --> 03:51.763
Because I have ears
in the King's court.

03:52.316 --> 03:55.774
And despite everyone's best efforts
to shield me from it, I know the truth.

03:58.197 --> 03:59.937
You love Snow White.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.154
And you have no intention
of marrying me.

04:05.496 --> 04:07.111
I won't marry someone I don't love.

04:07.498 --> 04:10.114
Or give that despot the satisfaction
that I helped him.

04:10.626 --> 04:14.585
And if that means suffering
the consequences, so be it.

04:14.755 --> 04:18.714
You're prepared to lay down
your life. How charming.

04:19.885 --> 04:22.467
But I didn't come here
to see you die.

04:23.889 --> 04:26.141
I came here to help you escape.

04:27.059 --> 04:28.469
Why would you do anything to help me?

04:29.478 --> 04:31.639
Because I don't want to
marry you, either.

04:35.484 --> 04:37.224
What did you tell her?

04:37.319 --> 04:41.062
That I needed to take a walk.
Clear my head. Think about it.

04:42.658 --> 04:44.740
I'm guessing you didn't tell her that
the walk was with me.

04:44.827 --> 04:45.816
(SIGHS)

04:45.911 --> 04:48.448
No. No, of course not.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.662
Why is that our default?

04:52.543 --> 04:53.532
Lying.

04:55.045 --> 04:56.034
Because, I don't...

04:56.130 --> 04:58.587
We're not being honest.

04:58.883 --> 05:02.717
I know it's hard.
But we have to tell her the truth.

05:02.803 --> 05:06.295
About everything. About us.

05:09.143 --> 05:11.008
I don't know if I can.

05:13.898 --> 05:16.264
You have to.

05:16.650 --> 05:20.939
If we can't be honest with other people,
how can we be honest with each other?

05:21.030 --> 05:22.736
Is it really the best plan?

05:23.365 --> 05:24.525
What's your plan?

05:25.493 --> 05:26.778
(SCOFFS)

05:27.786 --> 05:29.651
Moving to Boston?

05:29.747 --> 05:31.237
No.

05:32.291 --> 05:35.954
The only way no one gets hurt here

05:36.045 --> 05:37.535
is if we don't want to be together.

05:40.049 --> 05:42.756
Is that what you what?

05:45.387 --> 05:47.218
No.

05:47.973 --> 05:51.090
Well, then we have to stop hiding
and do something.

05:51.602 --> 05:55.265
It's better she hears it from you
than from someone else.

05:55.481 --> 05:57.221
You have to make a choice.

05:59.235 --> 06:00.395
(SIGHS)

06:02.071 --> 06:04.562
I choose you.

06:08.577 --> 06:11.319
Then it's time to tell Kathryn.

06:35.479 --> 06:38.061
I've been meaning to bump into you.

06:38.148 --> 06:40.764
Matter of fact, I was hoping we might
grab that drink you promised.

06:40.859 --> 06:42.440
Is that you asking me out?

06:42.611 --> 06:47.105
lf putting a label on it makes you more
comfortable, sure, let's call it a date.

06:47.658 --> 06:50.149
I thought you came here to write.
Find inspiration.

06:50.619 --> 06:52.280
Well, I'm Optimistic about our date.

06:53.122 --> 06:56.535
See, l have a policy. I won't go out with
guys who won't tell me their names.

06:56.625 --> 06:58.126
I find it weeds out the ones
who like to keep secrets.

06:58.210 --> 07:02.954
Like they're already married or they
store body parts in their freezer.

07:03.215 --> 07:04.455
It was nice talking to you.

07:06.635 --> 07:07.966
It's August.

07:10.514 --> 07:12.470
August W. Booth.

07:12.558 --> 07:15.174
Really? With the middle initial?

07:15.519 --> 07:16.975
W is for Wayne.

07:18.647 --> 07:23.516
So there goes your reason for not
meeting me here after work.

07:26.155 --> 07:28.111
(MOTORCYCLE ENGINE REVS)

07:31.994 --> 07:33.279
Who was that?

07:33.370 --> 07:35.656
I don't know yet.

07:35.998 --> 07:37.989
Yet. So you're going to find out?

07:38.500 --> 07:39.489
It's nothing.

07:40.210 --> 07:41.461
Nothing with you means something.

07:41.545 --> 07:43.285
Because if it were nothing,
we wouldn't be talking about it.

07:44.673 --> 07:48.837
I'm sorry, I thought you called me
here to talk about you.

07:48.927 --> 07:50.918
Yeah, but talking about you
is easier right now.

07:51.221 --> 07:52.552
What is it? What's going on?

07:55.351 --> 07:56.636
(WHISPERING)
Remember when you told me

07:56.727 --> 07:58.968
to stay away from David and I agreed?

07:59.355 --> 08:00.595
(WHISPERING) Yes.

08:01.857 --> 08:02.846
I didn't.

08:03.192 --> 08:04.352
Yeah. I know.

08:05.027 --> 08:06.608
You do? How?

08:06.695 --> 08:10.608
(LOWERED VOICE) Because I'm sheriff
and you are a Iovesick school teacher.

08:10.699 --> 08:12.439
Covering your tracks is not exactly
your strong suit.

08:12.534 --> 08:14.525
I've been discree... Discreet.

08:14.620 --> 08:17.953
Two tea cups in the Sink. New perfume.
Late nights, plunging neck lines.

08:18.040 --> 08:20.497
It was not hard to connect the dots.

08:20.584 --> 08:21.664

08:21.752 --> 08:24.619

08:30.052 --> 08:32.634
NO. According tO Henry, I'm yours.

08:32.721 --> 08:37.010
I just figured that you would
let me know when it was time.

08:37.101 --> 08:39.057
I'm assuming it's time?

which neighborhood to look at, but...

09:04.461 --> 09:06.247
NO. NO, I've never been.

09:06.338 --> 09:07.839
Maybe we should ask
the sheriff, Emma,

09:07.923 --> 09:09.504
she's from there. She could probably...

09:36.660 --> 09:41.450

that I don't know about?

09:44.293 --> 09:45.282
NO.

09:46.628 --> 09:49.370
I don't know. Something happened.

09:49.465 --> 09:51.126
I don't know what it is.

09:51.258 --> 09:56.093
There is something that's preventing
me from connecting.

09:56.305 --> 10:00.139
And it's not fair to you to let that
screw up your life.

10:00.517 --> 10:02.974
You're right. You need a fresh start.

10:05.314 --> 10:07.305
Just not with me.

(HORSE WHINNIES)

10:38.138 --> 10:40.925
I can't take any of it. Not until
you tell me what's really going on.

-I told you I'm just...
-Stop playing games!

10:44.853 --> 10:49.438
If you have no feelings for me as you've
said, why Show me any kindness at all?

10:49.525 --> 10:51.186
What haven't you told me?

10:51.276 --> 10:54.188
This isn't about you, James.

10:54.279 --> 10:55.439
It's me.

10:55.864 --> 10:59.573
I don't want to marry you because
my heart also belongs to another.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.537
A man I was once to wed,

11:04.248 --> 11:06.364
a man named Frederick.

11:07.376 --> 11:08.536
What happened?

11:08.877 --> 11:13.541
We all have our own tragedies.
Lost love being the worst.

11:13.882 --> 11:17.215
I thought reuniting you with yours
might grant me some consolation.

11:17.302 --> 11:20.214
Well, I'm afraid I'm not able to
help you, then.

11:20.973 --> 11:24.386
My love told me in no uncertain terms

11:24.476 --> 11:28.719
that she does not feel for me
as I do for her.

11:29.565 --> 11:32.227
Can't fight for something that
doesn't exist.

11:32.568 --> 11:36.937
SO, there's my tragedy.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.486
(SCOFFS)

11:40.701 --> 11:43.784
That's no tragedy. Come.

11:48.250 --> 11:49.740
Follow me.

11:53.422 --> 11:54.753
A moment, please?

12:02.264 --> 12:06.052
This is where my beloved Frederick
sacrificed his life.

12:06.143 --> 12:07.633
I'm sorry.

12:08.854 --> 12:10.094
Did he die in battle?

12:10.439 --> 12:12.600
We were traveling with my father,
King Midas,

12:12.691 --> 12:14.647
when our caravan was ambushed.

12:16.111 --> 12:20.650
Frederick bravely defended us. And
was cut down saving my father's life.

12:21.033 --> 12:25.993
It's a fitting tribute.
The craftsmanship is remarkable.

12:26.788 --> 12:30.121
I've never seen anything
quite so lifelike.

12:30.208 --> 12:33.041
That's because the arm you're touching
is actually Frederick's.

12:33.128 --> 12:34.117
Excuse me?

12:34.338 --> 12:35.623
It's not a statue.

12:36.840 --> 12:38.751
Frederick saw the attack
when no one else did

12:38.842 --> 12:40.582
and threw himself in front Of my father,

12:40.677 --> 12:42.633
knocking him to safety.

12:42.804 --> 12:46.467
Because of my father's curse,
he was instantly turned to gold.

12:46.642 --> 12:48.678
All curses can be broken.

12:49.770 --> 12:52.011
Have you tried true Iove's kiss?

12:52.105 --> 12:54.482
Until my lips bled.

12:54.816 --> 12:57.649
The gold got in the way.

12:57.778 --> 12:59.018
There must be something else to do.

13:03.909 --> 13:05.490
(INHALES DEEPLY)

13:06.495 --> 13:11.034
There is legend of a lake,
Lake Nostos.

13:12.334 --> 13:14.666
Its waters are said to have
magical properties

13:14.753 --> 13:17.335
that can return to you something
that was once lost.

13:17.422 --> 13:19.287
And yet you haven't tried it.

13:19.383 --> 13:20.668
Of course I have.

13:20.759 --> 13:25.173
But the lake is guarded by a ghastly
creature that drowns its victims.

13:25.263 --> 13:27.925
NO one who's ever faced it
has lived to return.

13:28.016 --> 13:30.257
Don't give up hope just yet.

13:30.352 --> 13:32.343
I will face this guardian

13:32.437 --> 13:34.814
and return with the water that will
undo this wretched curse.

13:34.898 --> 13:36.263
None have succeeded.

13:36.358 --> 13:37.768
None have my fearless bravery.

13:37.859 --> 13:41.101
Or fearless disregard
for their own safety.

13:41.196 --> 13:44.404
Either way,
one of us should have our happiness.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.231
And if you die, neither Of us will.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.317
NO, not true. Don't you understand?

13:48.412 --> 13:52.030
If I succeed, you will be reunited
with Frederick and your misery ends.

13:53.041 --> 13:57.535
If I fail, the misery that ends
will be mine.

15:07.157 --> 15:09.773

15:10.619 --> 15:11.779
What's the occasion?

15:12.245 --> 15:13.906
The occasion is I love you.

15:16.166 --> 15:17.326
Go on.

15:22.547 --> 15:24.253
(CHUCKLES)

15:24.341 --> 15:28.300
Now, I know you miss your book.
But with this, you can do the heroics.

15:28.678 --> 15:33.593
You can save the princesses.
You can be the hero.

15:34.101 --> 15:35.682

33:21.876 --> 33:25.869
(SIGHS) My marriage to David,
itjust was like an illusion.

33:25.963 --> 33:29.376
I don't know how it happened,
but it was never real.

33:29.967 --> 33:32.583
I know that now.

33:32.887 --> 33:37.847
The way David looks at Mary Margaret,
that's what I want for me.

33:38.642 --> 33:41.600
And I'm gonna go out there
and I'm gonna find it.

33:41.979 --> 33:43.844
What are you talking about?

33:44.190 --> 33:48.809
I'm sticking tO my plan
and moving to Boston. Alone.

33:48.903 --> 33:51.736
If I stay here, I'll never be happy.

33:51.906 --> 33:53.442
And what about David?

33:53.532 --> 33:56.774
I wrote him a letter.
Him and Mary Margaret.

33:56.869 --> 33:58.700
I told them they should be together.

33:58.787 --> 34:00.743
I'm sorry. You did what?

34:01.040 --> 34:04.908
I can't see him. Not now.
It's just too painful.

34:09.298 --> 34:10.333
Mmm.

34:10.424 --> 34:14.292
I'm gonna miss you, Regina.
You've been a good friend to me.

34:14.386 --> 34:15.842
Hmm.

34:15.930 --> 34:17.795
You're really going?

34:18.933 --> 34:20.298
You know, it's funny.

34:20.392 --> 34:22.804
I've always had this irrational fear
of leaving Storybrooke.

34:22.895 --> 34:25.728
Like something just holding me back.
Is that crazy?

34:25.814 --> 34:27.190
(CHUCKLES)

34:27.274 --> 34:30.562
NO. Change is always frightening.

34:32.112 --> 34:33.488
But you know what, Kathryn?

34:33.906 --> 34:36.943
This just may be what you need.

34:37.618 --> 34:38.949
(CHUCKLES)

34:39.203 --> 34:41.740
Maybe you'll find
what you're looking for.

34:48.754 --> 34:50.460
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

34:51.966 --> 34:53.581
(LAUGHS)

34:55.052 --> 34:58.215
Water from Lake Nostos. As requested.

34:58.305 --> 35:02.048
Remarkable. But how did you manage
to slay the beast?

35:02.142 --> 35:04.224
Well, the fate of your true love
was at stake.

35:04.311 --> 35:06.927
I knew it was a battle
I couldn't afford to lose.

35:33.257 --> 35:35.373
-(ARMOR CREAKING)
-(GRUNTS)

35:36.510 --> 35:37.716
(GASPS)

35:39.847 --> 35:40.836
(LAUGHS)

35:42.224 --> 35:43.634
Abigail, what happened to me?

35:43.726 --> 35:46.433
You were trapped.
But now you're free.

35:54.111 --> 35:56.352
This is James.

35:57.823 --> 36:01.031
He's the one who freed you.

36:02.119 --> 36:03.529
I am forever indebted to you.

36:04.079 --> 36:09.039
Pay me back by walking down the aisle
with someone you truly belong with.

36:11.128 --> 36:14.871
And perhaps giving me a horse
and supplies for a journey as well.

36:15.049 --> 36:18.587
-Done.
-Thank you so much.

36:19.928 --> 36:21.088
Where will you go?

36:22.014 --> 36:23.379
TO find Snow White.

36:23.474 --> 36:24.964
You are going after her.

36:25.059 --> 36:28.643
(SIGHS) True love isn't easy.

36:28.729 --> 36:33.063
But it must be fought for.
Because once you find it,

36:33.567 --> 36:35.649
it can never be replaced.

36:38.906 --> 36:40.487
How will you know where tO find her?

36:40.574 --> 36:44.317
Well, a bird helped me track her down
once. Hopefully, it can again.

36:44.411 --> 36:46.242
Well, then good luck.

36:47.581 --> 36:50.744
Oh, and, James, please make haste.

36:50.834 --> 36:54.122
When King George discovers that the
union of the kingdoms has been ruined,

36:54.254 --> 36:55.915
he will come after you.

36:56.006 --> 36:59.373
Some people will stop at nothing to
destroy the happiness of others.

37:37.965 --> 37:39.705
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

37:43.303 --> 37:44.634
(BEEPING)

37:44.721 --> 37:49.340
Wow. I love that game.
Space Paranoids, right?

37:49.935 --> 37:51.800
Yeah. My mom got it for me.

37:51.895 --> 37:54.307
I used to play that all the time
when I was a kid.

37:55.023 --> 37:56.604
Relax, it's all in the wrist.

37:56.692 --> 37:58.228
(GAME ENDS)

37:58.318 --> 37:59.398
(SIGHS)

38:02.990 --> 38:05.481
My mom's picking me up in,
like, five minutes.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.445
All right, I'll be quick, then.

38:07.536 --> 38:10.369
I just have something
I'd like to give you.

38:11.999 --> 38:14.160
You found it! Where did you get it?

38:14.251 --> 38:15.457
I found it in a gutter.

38:16.336 --> 38:18.588
It must've fallen off the dump truck
on the way to the junk yard

38:18.672 --> 38:21.414
and got tossed around in the rain and
somehow made its way back to me.

38:21.508 --> 38:23.590
Wow, that's crazy.

38:23.677 --> 38:25.463
What other explanation
could there be?

38:26.972 --> 38:28.087
I don't know.

38:29.141 --> 38:33.100
Well, whatever happened,
it came back to me.

38:33.187 --> 38:37.100
Maybe, it means our luck is changing.
Operation Cobra is back on.

38:37.357 --> 38:40.099
It's a Sign.
Things are gonna be better.

38:40.194 --> 38:43.106
I hope you're right, kid. I gotta go.

38:54.500 --> 38:55.865
Snow!

38:57.294 --> 38:59.876
Snow White!

39:05.052 --> 39:08.169
-Snow! Are you there?
-(HORSE WHINNIES)

39:08.263 --> 39:09.252
She's gone.

39:10.140 --> 39:12.051
She never came back
after she went to find you.

39:16.647 --> 39:17.727
Then I'll find her.

39:19.566 --> 39:21.067
Iwill always find her.

39:21.610 --> 39:23.521
And I will convince her that
we belong together.

39:23.862 --> 39:26.148
I will always fight for her,
no matter what comes between us.

39:26.240 --> 39:27.901
It won't be much of a fight.

39:28.325 --> 39:29.690
What are you talking about?

39:30.369 --> 39:32.860
Snow wants to be with you
more than anything.

39:34.498 --> 39:36.534
Don't mock me.

39:36.625 --> 39:40.243
Snow told me that we can't be together
because she doesn't love me.

39:40.837 --> 39:42.668
She left here to break up your wedding

39:42.756 --> 39:44.257
because she's in love with you.

39:47.094 --> 39:49.676
Unless something changed her mind
along the way.

39:49.763 --> 39:51.628
(SIGHS)

39:51.723 --> 39:54.590
Not something. Someone.

39:54.685 --> 39:56.425
-James!
-(MAN SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY)

39:57.229 --> 39:58.184
Who are they?

39:58.272 --> 40:00.263
That's "someone." King George.

40:00.607 --> 40:01.767
Bring me his head.

40:03.360 --> 40:05.442
Come on!

40:31.096 --> 40:32.927
You feel like talking about it, yet?

40:34.224 --> 40:35.634
Nope.

40:37.686 --> 40:39.096
You wanna be alone?

40:41.106 --> 40:42.095
(SIGHS) Nope.

41:14.181 --> 41:15.671
(SIGHS)
