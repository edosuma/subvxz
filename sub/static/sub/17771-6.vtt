WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:05.917
-Previously on MECH-X4:
-Grey!

00:06.000 --> 00:08.375
I'm very close to finding
the people behind MECH-X4.

00:08.458 --> 00:12.625
(Mark) It's like somebody specifically
designed that monster to target you.

00:12.709 --> 00:14.834
We need to find out who
is making these monsters,

00:14.917 --> 00:16.709
so we can bring the pain to them.

00:16.792 --> 00:20.792
(Grey) We can't just wait for Walker
to lead us to the robot anymore.

00:20.875 --> 00:22.083
(Davage)
Finally.

00:22.166 --> 00:24.750
Gravity pucks? A bounce belt?

00:24.834 --> 00:26.583
I found MECH-X4.

00:26.667 --> 00:29.417
(Mastermind) Destroy the pilots.
Bring the robot to me.

00:29.500 --> 00:31.750
It's done.
They just don't know it yet.

00:34.709 --> 00:35.709
(Harris)
I hate this.

00:35.792 --> 00:38.834
Dude, it's camping!
We loved camping as kids.

00:38.917 --> 00:40.500
No. You loved camping.

00:40.583 --> 00:42.250
You convinced us
we might find a treasure map.

00:42.333 --> 00:43.542
Yeah, or a mythical creature.

00:43.625 --> 00:45.458
And all we found was pneumonia.

00:45.542 --> 00:48.125
Guys, come on.
The outdoors are great.

00:48.208 --> 00:50.500
That's why they call them
the great outdoors.

00:50.583 --> 00:54.625
Yeah. Oh, well, that was before
we heard about the Bay City Butcher.

00:54.709 --> 00:58.166
The bloody-handed stalker
of Rodgers Forest.

00:58.250 --> 01:01.291
Wait. It's a ghost story.
You really believe that the Butcher

01:01.375 --> 01:03.959
was a cafeteria worker
tortured by freshmen

01:04.041 --> 01:06.792
and now he stalks the forest
waiting for revenge?

01:06.875 --> 01:09.208
Gosh, when you put it
like that, yes!

01:09.291 --> 01:10.750
And I'm more terrified
than ever.

01:10.834 --> 01:12.792
What? You are
smarter than that.

01:12.875 --> 01:15.208
I'm smart enough to know,
he was never caught

01:15.291 --> 01:16.834
and was in the woods for years.

01:16.917 --> 01:18.417
Oh, come on.
Do you hear yourself?

01:18.500 --> 01:20.834
Yes. It's irrational.

01:20.917 --> 01:24.834
But irrational fear is
the only fear I fear, Ryan.

01:24.917 --> 01:26.792
Well, I think he's real.

01:26.875 --> 01:28.250
And I'm gonna get
a photo of him,

01:28.333 --> 01:31.083
post it on the Internet,
and boom, instant fame.

01:31.166 --> 01:33.458
For once Smelly's right.

01:33.542 --> 01:35.125
Because the Bay City
Butcher is real.

01:35.208 --> 01:37.542
-(whimpers)
-Haven't you heard the warning?

01:37.625 --> 01:39.125
Zip your tent and post a guard

01:39.208 --> 01:41.041
Or end up in the funeral yard

01:41.125 --> 01:43.125
Every campout pays the price...

01:43.208 --> 01:45.875
(Both) When the Butcher
comes to chop and slice.

01:48.417 --> 01:50.959
And butcher kids up.

01:51.041 --> 01:53.542
Nope.
Went a bit long there.

01:57.125 --> 01:58.917
Well, now I'm more
scared than ever.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.417
I'd love to join you,
but it's Freshman Campout,

02:01.500 --> 02:04.000
which means...
varsity chilling in the robot.

02:04.083 --> 02:07.250
Oh, but don't worry, I'm sure
Ryan's technopathy will protect you...

02:07.333 --> 02:09.125
Oh, right.

02:09.208 --> 02:10.625
Not much good in the woods.

02:11.750 --> 02:13.333
Don't worry,
you had a good life.

02:14.333 --> 02:15.583
No I didn't.

02:16.750 --> 02:18.959
Let's go! Whoo!

02:19.041 --> 02:22.667
Got to make sure we don't leave behind
the three best friends.

02:22.750 --> 02:24.291
"The bros."

02:24.375 --> 02:26.625
I guarantee, you'll have
the time of your lives.

02:26.709 --> 02:28.750
Come on, it'll be fun.

02:28.834 --> 02:31.208
-Or we don't make it alive.
-Not helping!

02:31.291 --> 02:32.291
Here you go.

02:33.291 --> 02:36.041
Have fun.
Get in there.

02:39.208 --> 02:40.875
(bus engine starts)

02:43.792 --> 02:45.792
(theme song playing)

03:03.792 --> 03:04.709
Yes!

03:04.792 --> 03:06.709
The Bay City Butcher was real.

03:06.792 --> 03:08.709
Ooh!

03:08.792 --> 03:10.208
(laughs)

03:10.291 --> 03:14.041
But his victims were
all high school freshmen.

03:14.125 --> 03:16.333
So you sophomores
have nothing to worry about.

03:16.417 --> 03:18.000
But, uh, we're freshmen.

03:18.083 --> 03:19.542
Oh.

03:19.625 --> 03:21.375
Well, I'm sure
you'll be fine.

03:21.458 --> 03:23.583
Okay! Time to turn in your phones,

03:23.667 --> 03:24.709
-tablets, gadgets.
-Wait.

03:24.792 --> 03:27.709
Anything electronic,
into the bucket.

03:27.792 --> 03:30.625
What? Guys, without our phones,

03:30.709 --> 03:33.333
we're completely cut off
from the outside world.

03:33.375 --> 03:35.166
What if the monster attacks?

03:35.250 --> 03:37.333
What would Mark do without us?

03:37.417 --> 03:38.834

(phone rings)

03:58.792 --> 04:00.625
Hey, Mom.

04:00.709 --> 04:03.542
Uh... studying?

04:03.625 --> 04:05.125
You know, every year,

04:05.208 --> 04:06.750
there's at least one freshman

04:06.834 --> 04:08.792
who whines about their device.

04:08.875 --> 04:10.875
Park Ranger Jeff's
rule number eight:

04:11.000 --> 04:12.709
It's not camping
if you're not roughing it,

04:12.792 --> 04:16.000
and cell phones
are not roughing it.

04:16.083 --> 04:17.709
(whimpers)

04:20.959 --> 04:22.667
Weird.

04:22.750 --> 04:24.083
What?

04:24.166 --> 04:26.250
Well, you probably
get this all the time,

04:26.333 --> 04:28.792
but you look exactly

04:28.875 --> 04:30.458
like one of the
Butcher's victims.

04:31.458 --> 04:32.875
Except for the hood,
of course.

04:35.875 --> 04:37.208
It's uncanny.

04:37.291 --> 04:38.959
It's like I'm looking
at a ghost.

04:40.291 --> 04:41.959
Okay!

04:42.041 --> 04:44.083
Guys, it's going to be great.

04:44.166 --> 04:45.500
Yeah!

04:45.583 --> 04:47.208
Okay, guys,

04:47.291 --> 04:49.583
we're completely cut off
from the outside world,

04:49.667 --> 04:51.750
-so I'm gonna get the phones. Okay?
-Okay.

05:02.625 --> 05:03.834
Keep a lookout.

05:07.750 --> 05:08.917
Yes!

05:10.792 --> 05:13.333
-Oh! Hey! Lookout...
-Yeah.

05:13.417 --> 05:14.792
What do you think
you're doing?

05:14.875 --> 05:16.250
Kids need
their phones. Okay?

05:16.333 --> 05:17.792
And they need them
because...

05:17.875 --> 05:19.000
because of emergencies.

05:19.083 --> 05:21.875
Yeah, and we need to take
photos of horticulture.

05:21.959 --> 05:23.750
-Yeah!
-Yeah! You know.

05:23.834 --> 05:26.000
You know, play games when
we're bored, text our friends.

05:26.083 --> 05:27.291
Not helping.

05:28.458 --> 05:30.333
Well, I'm not
supposed to do this,

05:30.417 --> 05:33.041
but if it means that much to you,

05:33.125 --> 05:35.625
-you can have your phones...
-Thank you!

05:35.709 --> 05:37.917
When we leave tomorrow.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.417
Now you guys, you get out there,
you start gathering firewood for camp.

05:41.500 --> 05:43.500
-Go!
-Okay.

05:43.583 --> 05:45.083
All right, guys,
let's stick together.

05:45.166 --> 05:47.208
Or we could split up,

05:47.291 --> 05:49.291
that'll be a lot faster.

05:49.375 --> 05:51.083
No. Don't split up.

05:51.166 --> 05:53.542
Come on! Have any of you
seen a horror movie?

05:56.417 --> 05:57.792
(phone chirps)

05:57.875 --> 06:00.166
(Mastermind)
Do you have the pilots?

06:01.750 --> 06:02.792
Zeroing in on them.

06:02.875 --> 06:04.792
And the robot?

06:04.875 --> 06:05.750
In progress.

06:05.834 --> 06:08.750
Good. Because you've been
disappointing me.

06:08.834 --> 06:10.792
Get it done.
Do it right.

06:10.875 --> 06:12.625
(phone chirps)

06:17.959 --> 06:19.875
(twig snaps)

06:20.792 --> 06:22.041
Hello?

06:22.125 --> 06:24.125
Is anyone there?

06:24.208 --> 06:27.000
(branch snaps, clatters)

06:27.083 --> 06:28.917
Is anyone there?

06:34.834 --> 06:36.291
(screams)

06:36.375 --> 06:38.208
Why would you grab me?

06:38.291 --> 06:39.834
Why couldn't you just say, "Ryan"?

06:39.917 --> 06:42.834
Because I want you
to understand how I feel.

06:42.917 --> 06:44.875
-Which is?
-Terrified.

06:44.959 --> 06:47.375
And, honestly, a bit warm.

06:47.458 --> 06:50.709
Every time I hear
a leaf crunch or a twig snap,

06:50.792 --> 06:52.834
I pee a little.

06:52.917 --> 06:55.166
-That's super gross.
-(branch cracks)

06:55.250 --> 06:57.709
Aah! It's the Butcher!

06:57.792 --> 06:59.709
(screaming)

07:00.959 --> 07:03.291
-(laughing)
-Dane?

07:03.375 --> 07:06.291
I'm not the Bay City Butcher!
I tricked you guys!

07:06.375 --> 07:07.834
Varsity rules!

07:08.834 --> 07:11.083
It's me. It's Dane, man.

07:11.166 --> 07:13.834
Yeah, we get it, Dane.

07:13.917 --> 07:15.667
-(shutter clicks)
-Hey, what are you doing?

07:15.750 --> 07:19.166
Oh, just checking the box
on another varsity prank:

07:19.250 --> 07:22.750
"The Butcher stalks
freshmen campout."

07:22.834 --> 07:28.000
There is absolutely no reason to put
finger quotes around "campout."

07:28.083 --> 07:31.500
Look, get rid of the pic.
Fry the phone.

07:34.959 --> 07:36.959
Uh... No, wait. Yeah.

07:37.041 --> 07:38.709
You totally got us, Dane!

07:38.792 --> 07:41.583
-I totally did, right?
-Yeah, man.

07:41.667 --> 07:43.542
Man, I got to go scare
more freshmen.

07:43.625 --> 07:45.792
Varsity rules!

07:45.875 --> 07:47.834
-What was...?
-I don't know.

07:51.834 --> 07:54.792
The Butcher was here!
I missed him?

07:55.917 --> 07:57.083
Wait.

07:57.166 --> 07:58.750
Wait. You're the Butcher!

07:58.834 --> 08:01.208
You're sick, Harris!
You're sick!

08:01.291 --> 08:02.333
Oh my...

08:02.417 --> 08:04.166
Yep.

08:04.250 --> 08:06.709
(Harris) And that's why
we don't split up.

08:06.792 --> 08:09.166
I mean, what if that
was the real Butcher?

08:09.250 --> 08:11.250
There is no Butcher!

08:11.333 --> 08:13.250
And why didn't you
fry Dane's phone?

08:13.333 --> 08:15.041
Oh, we can snatch his phone. Right?

08:15.125 --> 08:17.750
And then we can keep an eye
on Bay City and keep it safe.

08:17.834 --> 08:19.792
Actually, you know what?
While we're at it,

08:19.875 --> 08:22.125
we can get a little revenge.

08:22.208 --> 08:24.667
You know who should
really be afraid right now?

08:24.750 --> 08:26.250
Dane.

08:28.250 --> 08:30.417
-(crowd chanting)
-(whistle trills)

08:32.417 --> 08:34.583
Go, Mark!
You got this!

08:34.667 --> 08:36.750
-(whistle trills)
-Yeah!

08:36.834 --> 08:38.667
Man, I'm good.

08:45.709 --> 08:47.750
(alert beeping)

08:47.834 --> 08:49.000
That sounds...

08:50.333 --> 08:52.291
not awesome.

09:03.166 --> 09:05.000
(metallic clanking)

09:35.333 --> 09:37.375
Wasn't expecting anyone here.

09:40.458 --> 09:41.834
(grunts)

09:43.542 --> 09:45.333
And when I'm done,
there won't be.

09:49.792 --> 09:53.792
(roaring)

09:57.792 --> 10:00.417
Okay, so, if we stick
to the plan

10:00.500 --> 10:01.834
everything will
go great, all right?

10:01.917 --> 10:03.166
You lure out Dane

10:03.250 --> 10:05.125
and you,
my lovely little friend,

10:05.208 --> 10:07.208
you will scare Dane

10:07.291 --> 10:08.917
with his mask.

10:10.875 --> 10:11.917
-All right, ready?
-Yeah.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.083
Okay. Here.

10:13.166 --> 10:14.667
-Dane will trip over the wire.
-Yeah.

10:14.750 --> 10:16.750
Then, the tent falls,

10:16.834 --> 10:17.667
Dane cries,

10:17.750 --> 10:19.250
we steal Dane's phone

10:19.333 --> 10:21.375
and then we leave
Dane in the woods. Easy.

10:21.458 --> 10:23.041
Yeah. What could
possibly go wrong, huh?

10:23.125 --> 10:25.709
-Literally everything.
-Oh.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.875
All right, are you ready?

10:27.959 --> 10:29.750
-I am ready. Are you ready?
-All right, Harris?

10:30.750 --> 10:32.166
-Harris?
-Harris?

10:32.250 --> 10:34.667
-Hey, Harris? Where did you go, man?
-Harris?

10:34.750 --> 10:36.583
Hey, Harris?

10:36.667 --> 10:38.625
Harris? Where are you?

10:38.709 --> 10:40.333
Harris?

10:40.417 --> 10:42.000
Where did you go, man?

10:42.083 --> 10:43.917
Harris?

10:45.291 --> 10:48.041
-Harris!
-Hey, come on, Dane! Let him go!

10:51.208 --> 10:53.667
Come on, Spyder,
do you see anything?

10:53.750 --> 10:55.750
Hey, Spyder,
stop clowning around.

11:00.959 --> 11:01.917
Spyder?

11:03.458 --> 11:05.709
Come on, Spyder,
stop playing around.

11:08.583 --> 11:10.834
(growling)

11:33.709 --> 11:35.166
Was that supposed to hurt?

11:35.250 --> 11:36.834
Yeah. I'm guessing it didn't.

11:42.792 --> 11:44.583
(grunts)

12:38.250 --> 12:39.750
This won't keep me
here forever.

12:39.834 --> 12:43.083
Doesn't have to. Just need time
to figure out what to do with you.

12:45.625 --> 12:47.792
Whoo! I'm so awesome.

12:47.875 --> 12:50.375
Spyder? Harris?

12:50.458 --> 12:52.041
(Dane)
Help! Help me!

12:53.125 --> 12:54.709
(groans)

12:54.792 --> 12:55.875
Help!

12:56.959 --> 12:58.000
I need help!

12:58.083 --> 12:59.291
Dane!

12:59.375 --> 13:01.709
What happened to you?

13:01.792 --> 13:03.792
-Wait. Are you crying?
-No!

13:03.875 --> 13:05.875
I got lost
and I sprained my ankle.

13:05.959 --> 13:08.250
I fell down a hill
into a poison ivy bush.

13:08.333 --> 13:10.792
I lost my phone,
I sprained my other ankle.

13:10.875 --> 13:11.709
Wait. Dane?

13:11.792 --> 13:13.083
Where are Spyder and Harris?

13:13.166 --> 13:14.792
I don't know.
I have no clue! Wait!

13:14.875 --> 13:18.166
Hold on!
If I don't make it back,

13:18.250 --> 13:19.625
tell Mark...

13:20.792 --> 13:22.792
he's awesome.

13:22.875 --> 13:24.542
Okay.

13:37.375 --> 13:39.417
What are you
doing out this far?

13:39.500 --> 13:40.917
Hey, Park Ranger Jeff!

13:41.000 --> 13:42.458
Or just Jeff.

13:42.542 --> 13:44.917
My first name's not
Park Ranger. (laughs)

13:46.000 --> 13:48.875
I'm really glad to see you.

13:57.583 --> 13:58.917
Come on, come on...

14:02.291 --> 14:04.417
I told you it wouldn't
hold me for long.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.375
A few minutes
would have been nice.

14:06.458 --> 14:08.375
Okay. Round two.

14:08.458 --> 14:12.000
Everybody keeps on talking about the
Bay City Butcher and everything.

14:12.083 --> 14:14.041
I don't think
he's real, but...

14:14.125 --> 14:16.375
my friends started disappearing,
and I know it's a ghost story,

14:16.458 --> 14:18.667
but I can't believe
I'm saying this, but...

14:18.750 --> 14:21.333
I think someone, or some thing,
took my friends.

14:21.417 --> 14:23.250
I know.

14:23.333 --> 14:25.709
And then he came
back to finish the job.

14:25.792 --> 14:27.333
What?

14:34.083 --> 14:36.792
So, you're behind
the monster attacks.

14:37.792 --> 14:38.917
Not exactly.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.208
I was just hired
to deal with three kids.

14:42.875 --> 14:45.291
(whispering)
Is there anything you can do?

14:45.375 --> 14:46.542
Phones.

14:47.792 --> 14:49.542
Dang, he turned them off.

14:51.208 --> 14:53.208
The electricity's
been shut off too.

14:54.208 --> 14:56.625
I can't believe
this is how I go.

14:56.709 --> 15:00.250
Because of some stupid ghost story
about a butcher that isn't even real.

15:01.959 --> 15:03.625
Hey, little buddy.

15:03.709 --> 15:06.208
Well, if it makes you feel
any better, after this weekend,

15:07.500 --> 15:09.792
the story will be real.

15:09.875 --> 15:11.208
It doesn't.

15:13.917 --> 15:16.792
(Davage yells)

16:00.000 --> 16:02.166
-(growls)
-Oh!

16:06.208 --> 16:07.625
Oh, man.

16:10.583 --> 16:12.834
(Jeff)
Every campout pays the price

16:12.917 --> 16:15.792
when the Butcher comes
to chop and slice.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.750
The legend of the
Bay City Butcher.

16:22.166 --> 16:24.792
The perfect cover story

16:24.875 --> 16:26.291
for your disappearance.

16:39.041 --> 16:42.291
(radio crackles, music plays)

16:43.709 --> 16:46.500
(whispers) Guys.
Guys, get to the breaker.

16:46.583 --> 16:48.375
And everyone plug your ears.

16:52.792 --> 16:55.375
-(high-pitched whining)
-(groaning)

16:57.917 --> 16:59.709
-Okay! Free!
-What?

16:59.792 --> 17:02.291
I've been tied up
so many times... (screams)

17:02.375 --> 17:03.750
Spyder!

17:07.792 --> 17:08.792
That's your plan?

17:08.875 --> 17:10.208
It's part of it.

17:17.917 --> 17:19.125
Come on!

17:21.667 --> 17:23.375
-Go!
-Almost got it!

17:23.458 --> 17:26.125
Almost got it!
Grab the phones and go!

17:26.208 --> 17:27.625
Come on!

17:27.709 --> 17:29.375
Go! Go! Go!

17:42.625 --> 17:44.291
How do I start this thing?

17:46.542 --> 17:48.208
Tell me!

17:48.375 --> 17:50.000
Turn it on?

17:50.083 --> 17:51.875
Are you trying
to steal this thing?

17:51.959 --> 17:53.083
You think this is funny?

17:53.166 --> 17:54.458
I can't help it.

17:54.542 --> 17:56.250
I can't turn it on,

17:56.333 --> 17:58.166
and I'm awesome.

17:58.250 --> 17:59.917
You got a backup plan?

18:01.000 --> 18:04.041
-Send it.
-"It"?

18:05.083 --> 18:06.709
(Harris)
Hello?

18:06.792 --> 18:08.583
Police! Hello?

18:08.667 --> 18:10.208
(Ryan) Come on!
We're being hunted!

18:10.291 --> 18:11.542
Come on!
Can you hear me?

18:11.625 --> 18:13.750
Good luck with
reception out here.

18:15.917 --> 18:18.333
-Good luck with that.
-Huh?

18:18.417 --> 18:19.709
(screams)

18:19.792 --> 18:21.709
Throw the phones!

18:24.125 --> 18:26.834
(screams)

18:52.458 --> 18:53.917
Dang!

18:57.583 --> 19:00.458
Guys, do you realize
what just happened?

19:00.542 --> 19:01.792
Someone targeted us.

19:01.875 --> 19:03.959
Someone knows
that we're MECH-X4.

19:05.458 --> 19:06.583
Oh, man.
We have to call Mark.

19:06.667 --> 19:09.208
Okay, he's alone in the robot.
He could be in danger.

19:09.291 --> 19:11.000
-(chiming)
-Hey, guys! I got bars.

19:16.417 --> 19:18.166
We have to get back.

19:42.208 --> 19:43.709
How are you doing that?

19:43.792 --> 19:46.125
You have no idea what
you're up against, do you?

20:02.625 --> 20:03.834
Why is it out of its silo?

20:03.917 --> 20:05.792
-Are you doing that?
-No!

20:05.875 --> 20:06.875
What's happening?

20:06.959 --> 20:09.375
You and the robot
are coming with me.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.291
(roaring)

20:34.333 --> 20:37.000
(theme music playing)

20:58.750 --> 21:00.166
(barks)
