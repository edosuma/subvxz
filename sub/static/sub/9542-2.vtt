07:50.571 --> 07:53.040
THERE HAVE BEEN CASES,
DOCUMENTED CASES,

WHERE PSYCHICS HAVE FOUND
MISSING KIDS.

THINK YOU SHOULD LOOK.

08:45.658 --> 08:47.794
WHY NOT?

08:47.827 --> 08:50.230
BECAUSE YOU SHOULD
REMEMBER HER LIKE SHE WAS.

MAYBE I COULD HELP YOU

10:54.721 --> 10:57.456
WITH, UH, ONE
OF YOUR CASES SOMETIME.

10:57.490 --> 10:58.926
CIAO.

10:58.959 --> 11:01.729
BYE.

11:05.065 --> 11:07.299
[car engine starts]

11:09.001 --> 11:10.269
[splat]
UHH!

11:10.302 --> 11:11.904
OHH!

11:13.306 --> 11:15.708
HOLD STILL,
HOLD STILL.

11:15.743 --> 11:18.044
IT'S NOT THE END
OF THE WORLD.

11:18.077 --> 11:19.712
DID YOU SEE THAT?

11:19.746 --> 11:20.947
JUST A LITTLE MUD.

11:20.980 --> 11:23.283
NO, SHE MOVED
HER SEAT FORWARD.

11:23.316 --> 11:26.052
WHEN SHE GOT IN THE CAR,
SHE MOVED HER SEAT.

11:40.299 --> 11:42.903
OH, I'M SORRY.
I THOUGHT THIS WAS MY OFFICE.

11:42.936 --> 11:44.971
YEAH, SEE,
I'M CONFUSED,

11:45.004 --> 11:46.373
BECAUSE MY NAME
IS ON THE DOOR.

11:46.405 --> 11:48.908
DON'T--DON'T BLAME
SHARONA, CAPTAIN.

11:48.942 --> 11:49.942
I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF BLAMING SHARONA.

11:49.976 --> 11:52.078
I WAS JUST FOLLOWING UP
ON THE ASHCOMBE CASE.

11:52.111 --> 11:53.379
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

11:53.413 --> 11:55.816
I TOOK THE LIBERTY
OF STRAIGHTENING UP A LITTLE.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.049
WHERE IS ALL MY CRAP?

11:57.084 --> 11:58.118
IT'S IN YOUR DRAWERS.

11:58.150 --> 12:00.988
AND, OF COURSE, I HAD
TO THROW SOME STUFF AWAY.

12:01.020 --> 12:02.889
I'M SORRY, SIR.

12:02.923 --> 12:05.024
I--I TRY TO STOP HIM, BUT...

12:05.057 --> 12:08.961
THERE IS NO
ASHCOMBE CASE, MONK.

12:08.995 --> 12:10.964
THE INQUEST IS OVER.

12:10.998 --> 12:13.033
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.001
IT WAS RAINING.
SHE WAS A TERRIBLE DRIVER.

12:15.034 --> 12:17.303
SHE WENT OFF THE ROAD.

12:17.336 --> 12:19.105
A MUDSLIDE
COVERED THE CAR.

12:19.139 --> 12:19.972
UNTIL--

12:20.006 --> 12:22.308
UNTIL THE BIGGEST FLAKE
IN NORTH AMERICA

12:22.341 --> 12:24.144
JUST HAPPENED TO FIND IT?

12:24.177 --> 12:26.312
AND YOU CAN'T STAND THAT,
CAN YOU?

12:27.847 --> 12:29.349
DOLLY FLINT...

12:29.381 --> 12:30.984
SHOWED YOU UP,

12:31.018 --> 12:33.821
AND YOU CAN'T STAND IT.

12:33.854 --> 12:36.990
ADRIAN...SIT.

12:37.024 --> 12:38.991
WE HAVE DOLLY FLINT'S FILE.

12:39.025 --> 12:40.092
YEAH, I KNOW
SHE HAS A JACKET, MONK.

12:40.126 --> 12:41.293
I MADE THREE OF THOSE COLLARS
MYSELF.

12:41.327 --> 12:44.030
FRAUD, TRESPASSING,
RECKLESS ENDANGERMENT.

12:44.063 --> 12:45.331
YEAH, SHE HAS
A SLEEP DISORDER.

12:45.365 --> 12:46.466
SHE WALKS IN HER SLEEP.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.936
SHE'S GOT, UM...
WHAT DO YOU CALL IT?

12:48.969 --> 12:49.937
SAMNU--

12:49.970 --> 12:50.903
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY CASES

12:50.937 --> 12:53.807
DOLLY FLINT OFFERED
TO HELP WITH AND FAILED?

12:53.841 --> 12:56.109
220.

12:56.143 --> 12:58.912
SO SHE'S ONE FOR 220.

12:58.946 --> 13:00.013
IT'S POSSIBLE.

13:00.047 --> 13:01.048
NO, IT'S NOT.

13:01.081 --> 13:02.081
YES, IT IS.

13:02.115 --> 13:05.018
SHE WAS PHOTOGRAPHED

13:05.052 --> 13:07.519
GOING THROUGH A RED LIGHT
LAST NIGHT.

13:07.553 --> 13:09.121
SHE WAS ALONE
IN THE CAR.

13:13.225 --> 13:15.394
IT HAPPENED.

13:24.037 --> 13:26.373
(Monk)
I'M NOT GOOD AT PARTIES.

13:26.405 --> 13:27.975
(Sharona)
IT'S NOT A PARTY.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.842
IT'S A MEMORIAL SERVICE.

13:32.379 --> 13:34.581
THIS IS A NICE PLACE.

13:34.614 --> 13:36.182
OBVIOUSLY,
WHOEVER LIVES HERE

13:36.216 --> 13:38.018
DOESN'T WORK FOR YOU.

13:38.051 --> 13:41.553
THE LATE MRS. ASHCOMBE
WAS RICHER THAN CANADA.

13:41.587 --> 13:44.024
COMMISSIONER.

13:44.057 --> 13:45.557
I THOUGHT
THIS MIGHT HELP.

13:45.591 --> 13:48.061
WHEN I LOST TRUDY,

13:48.095 --> 13:50.029
I--I READ IT
EVERY NIGHT.

13:50.062 --> 13:52.532
RALPH WALDO EMERSON.

13:52.565 --> 13:54.067
YES, SIR.

13:54.100 --> 13:55.101
THANK YOU, ADRIAN.

13:55.134 --> 13:57.104
AND THANK YOU FOR COMING.

13:57.136 --> 13:59.239
IT MEANS THE WORLD
TO ME.

14:01.041 --> 14:04.076
IT LOOKS LIKE WE WON'T
REQUIRE YOUR SERVICES AFTER ALL.

14:04.110 --> 14:07.480
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW HOW MUCH
I APPRECIATE YOUR OFFER.

14:10.317 --> 14:11.484
THANK YOU.

14:13.986 --> 14:14.955
HOLD ON.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.556
NO, NO, BATHROOM.
BATHROOM.

14:16.588 --> 14:18.258
I NEED TO WASH.
JUST...TRY UPSTAIRS.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.092
DID YOU SEE THAT?
IT WAS A TWO-HANDER.

14:20.126 --> 14:22.461
I SAW IT, JUST...
DON'T MAKE A SCENE.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.152
THE GUEST BATHROOM
IS DOWN THE HALL.

15:19.186 --> 15:21.388
COMMISSIONER.
I'M SORRY.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.590
UH, I WAS, UH...

15:23.623 --> 15:24.957
I WAS, UH...

15:24.991 --> 15:26.058
I WAS--I WAS JUST--

15:26.092 --> 15:28.360
I MEAN, LATER...

15:28.394 --> 15:29.662
AFTER, YOU KNOW, BEFORE,

15:29.696 --> 15:33.066
WHEN WE--I--OKAY.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.033
HERE'S THE THING--

15:34.067 --> 15:36.068
I CAN REMEMBER WHEN
YOU BEGAN THIS SENTENCE.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.336
[chuckles]

15:37.370 --> 15:38.404
EVERYONE GETS LOST.

15:38.437 --> 15:40.673
THE HOUSE WAS ALWAYS TOO BIG
FOR KATHERINE AND ME.

15:40.706 --> 15:41.540
WE DIDN'T BUY IT.

15:41.573 --> 15:43.976
IT WAS A WEDDING GIFT
FROM HER FATHER.

15:44.010 --> 15:45.979
AH.

15:46.013 --> 15:48.148
YOU UNDERSTAND, RIGHT?

15:48.181 --> 15:51.183
I MEAN, YOU LOST
YOUR WIFE.

15:52.519 --> 15:55.554
UH, UNDERSTAND WHAT, SIR?

15:55.587 --> 15:58.158
THE NATURAL DESIRE
TO PACK HER THINGS AWAY.

15:58.191 --> 16:00.759
YOU DON'T WANT THEM AROUND
TO...REMIND YOU.

16:00.793 --> 16:04.764
I GUESS I HAD
THE OPPOSITE REACTION.

16:04.797 --> 16:09.068
I HAVEN'T THROWN ANYTHING
OF TRUDY'S AWAY.

16:09.101 --> 16:11.104
NOT EVEN A HAIRBRUSH.

16:11.138 --> 16:14.974
NOT EVEN A...
HAIR FROM A HAIRBRUSH.

16:16.109 --> 16:17.476
REALLY?

16:19.812 --> 16:22.649
[faint piano music
and chatter]

16:22.682 --> 16:24.051
SO, WHAT, HE LEAVES
THE HOUSE LIKE, UH,

16:24.083 --> 16:25.751
TWICE A WEEK NOW?

16:25.784 --> 16:28.654
WHAT KIND OF QUESTION
IS THAT, HMM?

16:28.687 --> 16:29.755
HE LEAVES THE HOUSE
ALL THE TIME.

16:29.788 --> 16:31.158
HE'S NOT DISABLED.

16:31.191 --> 16:33.259
HE JUST GETS
A LITTLE ANXIOUS ABOUT--

16:33.293 --> 16:35.427
EVERY SINGLE THING.

16:35.461 --> 16:37.029
WELL, YOU KNOW,

16:37.063 --> 16:38.431
THE FACT IS...

16:38.465 --> 16:41.433
WE'RE GETTING OFFERS
FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY,

16:41.467 --> 16:42.568
EVERY DAY.

16:42.601 --> 16:43.769
I MEAN, I HAD
TO DISCONNECT MY PHONE.

16:43.802 --> 16:44.770
IT WAS DRIVING ME CRAZY.

16:44.803 --> 16:46.438
SURE.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.480
[indistinct chatter]

17:04.156 --> 17:05.724
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:05.758 --> 17:07.059
YOU CAN'T LOOK
THROUGH PEOPLE'S MAIL.

17:07.094 --> 17:08.494
I'M NOT STEALING ANYTHING.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.797
I'M JUST COMBING THROUGH.

17:10.829 --> 17:12.298
I DON'T WANNA LIVE
IN A WORLD WHERE A PERSON

17:12.332 --> 17:13.799
CAN'T COMB THROUGH
ANOTHER PERSON'S MAIL.

17:13.833 --> 17:16.068
[sighs]

17:16.103 --> 17:17.203
CAN YOU JUST HURRY UP?

17:17.237 --> 17:19.538
"JENNIE ZEPPETTELLI."

17:21.540 --> 17:22.775
SMELL THAT.

17:22.808 --> 17:24.510
IT'S PERFUME.

17:24.544 --> 17:27.180
SHALIMAR.
IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE.

17:27.213 --> 17:29.816
OBVIOUSLY AN OLD GIRLFRIEND.

17:29.848 --> 17:32.852
SHE LOVED HIM.
BUT IT'S OVER NOW.

17:32.884 --> 17:34.753
HOW DO YOU KNOW ALL THAT?

17:34.787 --> 17:38.724
I'VE NEVER UNDERLINED ANYTHING
SIX TIMES, HAVE YOU?

17:57.277 --> 17:59.679
(Monk)
I AGREE, JENNIFER.

17:59.711 --> 18:02.414
HE DID WASTE THE BEST
FIVE YEARS OF YOUR LIFE.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.317
HOW DID YOU KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING?

18:04.351 --> 18:06.586
YOU WERE LOOKING

18:06.618 --> 18:08.755
AT THE EMPTY BOTTLES
OF BEAUJOLAIS.

18:08.788 --> 18:11.391
THEY'RE DATED, ONE FOR EACH
OF THE LAST FIVE YEARS.

18:11.423 --> 18:14.594
THEY OBVIOUSLY REPRESENT
ANNIVERSARIES.

18:14.626 --> 18:16.128
AND I SAW YOU

18:16.163 --> 18:17.163
FEEL YOUR RING FINGER,

18:17.196 --> 18:18.431
WHICH DOESN'T HAVE A RING.

18:18.464 --> 18:21.134
ARE YOU A PSYCHIC,
MR. MONK?

18:21.167 --> 18:22.501
[scoffs]

18:22.535 --> 18:25.438
HE'S A PSYCHIC WHO DOESN'T
BELIEVE IN PSYCHICS.

18:25.471 --> 18:27.507
JENNIFER, WE KNOW YOU WERE
HAVING AN AFFAIR

18:27.539 --> 18:28.775
WITH HARRY ASHCOMBE.

18:30.942 --> 18:32.744
IS IT OVER?

18:32.778 --> 18:34.780
I WISED UP.

18:34.814 --> 18:36.915
IT ONLY TOOK FIVE YEARS.

18:36.949 --> 18:40.787
I REALIZED HARRY WAS NEVER
GONNA LEAVE HIS WIFE.

18:40.819 --> 18:42.322
AND NOT BECAUSE
HE LOVED HER.

18:42.355 --> 18:44.923
I MEAN, HE DESPISED HER.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.625
HE JUST COULDN'T
LIVE WITHOUT THE MONEY.

18:46.659 --> 18:48.528
WHEN DID YOU SEE HIM LAST?

18:48.560 --> 18:49.895
ABOUT FOUR MONTHS AGO.

18:49.929 --> 18:51.897
BUT HE CALLS ME ALL THE TIME,

18:51.931 --> 18:54.166
AND HE--HE SENDS ME GIFTS.

18:54.201 --> 18:55.535
I MEAN, WHAT HAPPENED
TO HIS WIFE,

18:55.567 --> 18:56.603
IT WASN'T MY FAULT.

18:56.635 --> 18:59.172
HE'S JUST...HE'S CRAZY.

18:59.205 --> 19:01.874
YOU MEAN THE ACCIDENT?

19:04.810 --> 19:06.778
YOU DON'T BELIEVE
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT?

19:06.813 --> 19:07.846
I DON'T KNOW.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.781
ALL I KNOW
IS THAT HARRY ASHCOMBE

19:09.816 --> 19:11.518
IS A VERY DANGEROUS MAN.

19:13.685 --> 19:16.323
I HOPE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

19:16.355 --> 19:19.326
(Sharona)
DO WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING?

19:19.358 --> 19:21.294
RELAX, I HAVE BEEN
HANDLING REFRIGERATORS

19:21.327 --> 19:22.662
SINCE I WAS 15.

19:22.694 --> 19:24.963
NO, I'M TALKING ABOUT THE CASE.

19:24.997 --> 19:28.300
THE FORMER COMMISSIONER ISN'T
JUST ANOTHER SUSPECT, ADRIAN.

19:28.335 --> 19:29.902
HE IS CONNECTED.

19:29.935 --> 19:32.805
HE IS THE MAN, AND YOU BETTER
BE SURE ABOUT THIS.

19:32.838 --> 19:35.307
I'M AS SURE AS I CAN BE

19:35.342 --> 19:37.910
WITHOUT ANY, YOU KNOW,
PROOF.

19:39.511 --> 19:40.512
ALL OF HER STUFF

19:40.547 --> 19:42.414
WAS PACKED UP.

19:42.449 --> 19:43.883
HE COULDN'T WAIT
TO GET RID OF IT.

19:43.915 --> 19:45.785
BUT THAT DOESN'T
MEAN ANYTHING.

19:45.817 --> 19:46.885
THERE WERE BOOTS
IN THE CLOSET

19:46.919 --> 19:50.390
THAT WERE COVERED
WITH MUD.

19:50.423 --> 19:52.991
GOOD UNTIL JULY 22ND.

19:53.025 --> 19:55.662
SELL BY JULY 20TH.

19:55.694 --> 19:56.695
DAH!

19:59.865 --> 20:02.469
YOU REALLY THINK HE FORCED
HIS WIFE OFF THE ROAD?

20:02.501 --> 20:03.903
YEP.

20:03.935 --> 20:04.971
ANY IDEA HOW?

20:05.003 --> 20:07.307
WELL, UNLESS I'M CRAZY,

20:07.339 --> 20:10.876
HE PUT SOMETHING ON THE ROAD
THAT SENT HER OVER THE SIDE.

20:10.910 --> 20:13.346
NOW, THAT WAS
THE EASY PART.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.682
THE HARD PART CAME LATER.

20:15.714 --> 20:18.317
WHAT'S THAT?

20:18.351 --> 20:21.354
GETTING THAT LOONY TUNE
DOLLY FLINT

20:21.387 --> 20:23.690
TO FIND THE BODY.

20:23.722 --> 20:25.791
THAT'S THE REAL MYSTERY HERE.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.327
HOW DID HE DO THAT?

20:28.361 --> 20:29.362
WELL, YOU CAN ASK HER.

20:29.395 --> 20:32.565
I GOT A READING WITH HER
AT 3:00.

20:32.598 --> 20:33.700
WHY DON'T YOU COME ALONG?

20:33.732 --> 20:35.602
MAYBE I WILL.

20:39.905 --> 20:42.842
MMM...

20:42.875 --> 20:44.576
VERY POSITIVE PERSON.

20:44.611 --> 20:46.712
HMM, VERY SPIRITUAL.

20:46.746 --> 20:47.713
THAT'S TRUE.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.348
HMM.
THAT'S TRUE.

20:49.382 --> 20:51.017
HMM, BUT YOU'VE
BEEN TROUBLED.

20:51.049 --> 20:52.684
YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE
SLEEPING.

20:52.719 --> 20:53.952
AM I RIGHT?

20:53.986 --> 20:55.855
YEAH. YEAH.
UH-HUH.

20:55.887 --> 20:57.757
YOU CAN TELL ALL THAT
FROM THE BUMPS IN MY HEAD?

20:57.789 --> 20:58.924
MM-HMM.
IT'S CALLED PHRENOLOGY.

20:58.958 --> 21:02.994
SEE, THE SHAPE OF YOUR HEAD
IS LIKE A SPIRITUAL ROAD MAP.

21:03.028 --> 21:04.997
YOU JUST HAVE TO KNOW
HOW TO READ IT.

21:05.030 --> 21:06.499
(Sharona)
FEELS GOOD.

21:06.532 --> 21:07.967
SHH.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.736
OKAY.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.069
THERE'S A YOUNG MAN
IN YOUR LIFE.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.872
OH, THAT WOULD BE MY SON.

21:12.904 --> 21:13.873
YEAH, HIS NAME'S BENJI.

21:13.905 --> 21:15.074
OH.

21:15.106 --> 21:17.443
AND ANOTHER MAN.

21:17.477 --> 21:18.744
NOW, HE'S NOT YOUNG,

21:18.778 --> 21:20.413
BUT HE'S LIKE A CHILD.

21:20.446 --> 21:22.080
THAT WOULD BE MY BOSS.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.415
MM.

21:23.450 --> 21:25.484
OOH, THIS
IS VERY DIFFICULT.

21:25.518 --> 21:28.755
THE MAN IS CAUSING YOU
A LOT OF ANXIETY.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.589
(Sharona)
YOU KNOW, I JUST DON'T
WANNA TALK ABOUT IT.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.424
OKAY, PLEASE?

21:32.459 --> 21:34.594
YEAH, THIS IS ANOTHER MAN.

21:34.626 --> 21:35.761
A NEW MAN.

21:35.795 --> 21:36.929
OH, HONEY,
THIS IS A REAL MAN.

21:36.962 --> 21:38.431
REALLY?

21:38.464 --> 21:39.465
YEAH.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.401
[giggles]

21:41.433 --> 21:43.068
[clatter]

21:43.102 --> 21:44.903
WHAT WAS THAT?

21:44.936 --> 21:47.440
WAIT, LET'S--LET'S
TALK ABOUT THAT MAN.

21:47.473 --> 21:49.476
WHERE'S YOUR FRIEND
MR. MONK?

21:54.947 --> 21:57.916
[approaching footsteps]

21:57.950 --> 22:00.019
MR. MONK.

22:00.051 --> 22:01.921
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
IN THE WAITING ROOM.

22:03.423 --> 22:04.824
I WAS THIRSTY.

22:04.856 --> 22:07.026
YEAH, WELL,
YOU SHOULD HAVE ASKED.

22:08.728 --> 22:09.828
EXCUSE THE MESS.

22:09.862 --> 22:11.063
MY CLEANING GIRL
GOT HERSELF KNOCKED UP

22:11.096 --> 22:12.932
BY SOME GUY
FROM PARAGUAY.

22:12.964 --> 22:14.901
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

22:16.035 --> 22:17.436
WHAT DO THEY
CALL 'EM ANYWAY--

22:17.470 --> 22:19.705
PARAGUIANS?

22:19.739 --> 22:21.874
HERE YOU GO.

22:21.907 --> 22:23.509
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M FINE.

22:23.542 --> 22:27.547
IT'S, UH...
IT'S JUST A COUGH DROP

22:27.579 --> 22:29.548
STUCK IN MY THROAT THERE.

22:29.582 --> 22:30.849
BUT I'M FINE NOW.
THANK YOU.

22:30.883 --> 22:32.117
SUIT YOURSELF.

22:32.151 --> 22:33.920
[slurp]

22:33.952 --> 22:35.988
WHY DON'T YOU
COME AND JOIN US?

22:36.021 --> 22:37.824
MMM.

22:37.856 --> 22:39.491
MM-HMM.

22:39.526 --> 22:41.093
THE CHARIOT.

22:41.126 --> 22:43.162
YOU'RE A VERY
RESTLESS SOUL.

22:43.194 --> 22:44.797
HMM?

22:44.830 --> 22:45.897
OH!

22:45.932 --> 22:47.500
NOW, THIS IS INTERESTING.

22:47.534 --> 22:48.734
THE KNIGHT OF PENTACLES.

22:48.768 --> 22:49.868
IS THAT GOOD?

22:49.902 --> 22:51.604
WELL, IT CONFIRMS
WHAT I FELT EARLIER:

22:51.637 --> 22:52.872
ROMANCE.

22:52.904 --> 22:54.707
YOU KNOW ANYONE
WITH A BRITISH ACCENT?

22:54.740 --> 22:55.974
[sighs]

22:56.008 --> 22:57.509
NO.
YOU WILL.

22:57.544 --> 22:58.944
VERY SOON.

22:58.978 --> 23:01.113
A BRITISH ACCENT, HUH?

23:01.146 --> 23:02.615
HE'S NOT GONNA

23:02.648 --> 23:03.782
LOOK LIKE THAT, IS HE?

23:03.816 --> 23:05.084
[laughs]

23:05.116 --> 23:06.952
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

23:06.986 --> 23:10.122
AH, NO, HE'S
GONNA BE TALL,

23:10.155 --> 23:13.425
AND HIS NAME IS...
DEREK.

23:13.460 --> 23:14.894
DAVID?

23:14.926 --> 23:17.896
CONGRATULATIONS, I'M SURE YOU'LL
BOTH BE DELIRIOUSLY HAPPY.

23:17.930 --> 23:20.031
MS. FLINT, UH, ABOUT
FINDING MRS. ASHCOMBE--

23:20.066 --> 23:21.901
NO, I DIDN'T
FIND ANYBODY.

23:21.933 --> 23:24.036
HER SPIRIT
LED ME TO HER.

23:24.069 --> 23:26.472
OF COURSE.
YEAH, OF COURSE.

23:26.506 --> 23:29.608
DID--DID YOU KNOW HER
BEFORE SHE DIED?

23:29.642 --> 23:30.910
NO, I NEVER MET HER,

23:30.942 --> 23:32.944
AND I'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS
ABOUT A MILLION TIMES.

23:32.979 --> 23:33.980
NO, I UNDERSTAND--

23:34.012 --> 23:35.047
EXCUSE ME.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.849
UM, ABOUT THE MAN
WITH THE ACCENT.

23:37.884 --> 23:39.050
HOW WILL I KNOW IT'S HIM?

23:39.085 --> 23:40.051
OH, WELL, YOU'LL KNOW.

23:40.086 --> 23:41.019
LIKE ALL WOMEN KNOW.

23:41.052 --> 23:43.890
YOU JUST HAVE TO KEEP
AN OPEN HEART, SHARONA.

23:43.923 --> 23:46.192
SO SHE WASN'T A CLIENT?

23:46.224 --> 23:47.759
NO.

23:47.794 --> 23:49.695
DOLLY...

23:49.729 --> 23:50.896
UH, YOU SAID SOON.

23:50.930 --> 23:53.965
YOU MEAN LIKE THIS WEEK
OR NEXT WEEK?

23:54.000 --> 23:54.901
UM...

23:54.933 --> 23:57.604
YOU KNOW, I'D SAY BEFORE
THE NEXT FULL MOON.

23:57.636 --> 23:59.806
I'M--I'M SORRY, BUT, UH...

23:59.838 --> 24:01.840
HERE ON THE PLANET EARTH,

24:01.874 --> 24:04.175
THERE'S A DEAD WOMAN,

24:04.210 --> 24:06.712
AND...SOMEBODY IS RESPONSIBLE.

24:06.746 --> 24:07.846
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT,
MR. MONK.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.981
SHE DROVE OFF THE HIGHWAY.
RIGHT.

24:10.016 --> 24:12.984
WHAT EXACTLY
DO YOU REMEMBER

24:13.019 --> 24:14.185
ABOUT THAT NIGHT?

24:14.220 --> 24:15.555
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU ARE, MR. MONK?

24:15.587 --> 24:17.656
YOU ARE WHAT WE
IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD

24:17.690 --> 24:19.025
CALL A BUZZ-KILL.

24:19.057 --> 24:20.926
THANK YOU.
FINE!

24:20.960 --> 24:21.993
IT'S YOUR MONEY.

24:22.028 --> 24:23.730
I WENT TO BED,
I HAVE INSOMNIA.

24:23.762 --> 24:24.997
I TOOK MY PILLS.

24:25.030 --> 24:28.000
I FINALLY GOT TO SLEEP
AT ABOUT, UM...3:00.

24:28.034 --> 24:29.201
NO, IT WAS 3:30.

24:29.234 --> 24:30.869
I WAS WATCHING LAW & ORDER.

24:30.903 --> 24:31.971
GO ON.

24:32.003 --> 24:33.038
AND THAT'S IT.

24:33.072 --> 24:35.541
I WOKE UP NEXT
TO MRS. ASHCOMBE.

24:35.575 --> 24:37.743
NOW I GO TO BED
WITH MY COAT ON,

24:37.777 --> 24:39.010
HOLDING MY CAR KEYS,
JUST IN CASE.

24:39.045 --> 24:40.980
OKAY, ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?

24:41.012 --> 24:42.548
YOU HAPPY?

24:42.582 --> 24:43.715
DOLLY, DOLLY,

24:43.750 --> 24:45.017
WHAT DOES HE DO LIKE, UM,
FOR A LIVING?

24:45.050 --> 24:46.184
I MEAN, HE HAS A JOB,
RIGHT?

24:46.218 --> 24:47.720
SHARONA, PLEASE.
WHAT?

24:47.753 --> 24:50.656
PLEASE, I'M--
I'M WORKING HERE.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.023
I'M WORKING HERE.

24:53.192 --> 24:54.826
UHH!

24:54.861 --> 24:55.961
GAH! AHH!

24:55.994 --> 24:56.996
WHAT DID YOU DO?

24:57.028 --> 24:57.997
ARE YOU INSANE?!

24:58.029 --> 24:59.131
I NEED A--

24:59.164 --> 25:00.932
I NEED A WIPE HERE.
GET IN THE CAR.

25:00.967 --> 25:02.101
DON'T DO THIS.
GIVE ME A WIPE.

25:02.134 --> 25:03.201
IN THE CAR.

25:03.234 --> 25:05.538
GO TO THE CAR.
I'LL GET THE WIPES.

25:05.571 --> 25:07.839
[whispering]
GO TO THE CAR.

25:10.276 --> 25:12.578
UM...ABOUT THIS DAVID
OR DEREK...

25:12.612 --> 25:13.880
HE'S NOT MARRIED, IS HE?

25:13.913 --> 25:16.248
[hyperventilating]

25:18.884 --> 25:20.619
[grunts]

25:20.653 --> 25:22.020
[sighs]

26:00.859 --> 26:02.694
WHAT IS HE DOING?

26:02.729 --> 26:04.896
OHH, I DON'T KNOW.

26:04.931 --> 26:06.898
DID YOU FINISH
ALL YOUR MATH?

26:08.334 --> 26:10.269
YOU HAVE A WEIRD JOB.

26:10.301 --> 26:12.971
BENJI, JUST FINISH THE MATH.

26:40.031 --> 26:42.101
[trolley bell ringing]

26:44.103 --> 26:46.072
MR. MONK, YOU WERE RIGHT.

26:46.105 --> 26:48.807
IT'S A PERFECT MATCH.
REALLY?

26:48.840 --> 26:51.176
THEY'RE MADE BY A COMPANY
CALLED DECORATIVE GRAVEL.

26:51.210 --> 26:54.947
NOW, THAT PARTICULAR COLOR
IS CALLED VOLCANIC TOUGH.

26:54.980 --> 26:56.782
IT'S NOT VERY POPULAR.
IT'S FROM NEW MEXICO.

26:56.816 --> 26:57.950
I TALKED TO THE BOOKKEEPER,

26:57.983 --> 26:59.719
AND SHE SAID
THEY ONLY DID ONE,

26:59.751 --> 27:01.019
MAYBE TWO DRIVEWAYS
IN THE AREA.

27:01.053 --> 27:04.022
SO IF THIS CAME
FROM SOMEBODY'S CAR,

27:04.056 --> 27:06.692
THEN THIS ONE CAME
FROM SOMEBODY'S DRIVEWAY.

27:06.726 --> 27:09.028
AT SOME POINT, THAT CAR
WAS ON THAT DRIVEWAY.

27:09.060 --> 27:10.930
YOU CAN BET THE FARM.

27:10.962 --> 27:13.332
(man on P.A.)
CUSTOMER SERVICE
TO PAINT DEPARTMENT, PLEASE.

27:13.365 --> 27:14.967
SO...

27:15.000 --> 27:17.068
(Monk)
ASHCOMBE SAID...

27:17.103 --> 27:18.369
HE NEVER MET
DOLLY FLINT.

27:18.403 --> 27:21.039
AND SHE SAID
SHE NEVER MET HIM.

27:21.073 --> 27:23.009
MAYBE THEY BOTH
JUST FORGOT.

27:23.041 --> 27:24.309
[whirring loudly]

27:24.343 --> 27:26.913
AAH! AAH!

27:28.914 --> 27:31.150
NOBODY MOVE!

27:31.182 --> 27:33.051
NOBODY MOVE!

27:33.085 --> 27:34.153
[echoing]
HELLO.

27:34.185 --> 27:35.788
[feedback]

27:35.822 --> 27:38.356
HELLO.
MY NAME IS ADRIAN.

27:38.390 --> 27:39.991
MONK.

27:40.026 --> 27:41.961
I'M WORKING
WITH THE POLICE

27:41.993 --> 27:43.930
ON A HOMICIDE INVESTIGATION.

27:43.962 --> 27:47.733
THERE IS A VERY VALUABLE
PIECE OF EVIDENCE

27:47.767 --> 27:50.201
SOMEWHERE IN THIS STORE.

27:50.236 --> 27:53.372
IT'S A SMALL PEBBLE.

27:53.404 --> 27:55.907
IT'S ABOUT THE SIZE

27:55.942 --> 27:57.076
OF A...

27:59.912 --> 28:02.949
SMALL PEBBLE.

28:02.981 --> 28:06.752
IF YOU COULD ALL JUST--
JUST STOP, PLEASE,

28:06.786 --> 28:08.820
AND LOOK AROUND.

28:08.855 --> 28:10.789
WHAT...

28:10.823 --> 28:14.192
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

28:14.226 --> 28:15.260
SWEEPING UP.

28:19.965 --> 28:22.067
OKAY, WHERE'S
THE REST OF IT?

28:22.101 --> 28:23.935
(Sharona)
IT'S NOT IN HERE!

28:23.970 --> 28:25.738
KEEP LOOKING.

28:25.771 --> 28:28.840
IT'S A SMALL, BLACK PEBBLE.
[rummaging]

28:28.875 --> 28:30.076
GOD.

28:30.108 --> 28:32.711
[grunting and rummaging]

28:39.117 --> 28:41.052
WAIT A MINUTE.

28:41.086 --> 28:42.253
[laughing]
I FOUND IT.

28:42.288 --> 28:43.823
HA HA, I FOUND IT.

28:43.855 --> 28:44.856
WHERE WAS IT?

28:44.891 --> 28:47.058
IT WAS IN MY, HEH...

28:47.093 --> 28:49.228
MUST HAVE--
MUST HAVE FLOWN...

28:49.260 --> 28:51.063
OH, MY GOOOOD!

28:51.096 --> 28:51.931
[thunk]

28:51.963 --> 28:53.231
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I LISTENED TO YOU!

28:53.265 --> 28:55.101
YOU DRIVE ME NUTS!

29:00.405 --> 29:02.808
(Sharona)
ADRIAN, ARE YOU SURE
ABOUT THIS?

29:02.842 --> 29:04.844
WELL, NO.

29:04.876 --> 29:05.944
YOU'D BETTER BE RIGHT.

29:05.978 --> 29:07.179
I SWEAR, I'LL KILL YOU.

29:09.048 --> 29:10.048
MONK.

29:10.082 --> 29:11.416
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

29:11.450 --> 29:13.551
YOUR HOUSEKEEPER
SAID WE MIGHT FIND YOU HERE.

29:13.585 --> 29:14.854
IS THE DOG OKAY?

29:14.886 --> 29:15.988
THE DOG'S FINE.

29:16.021 --> 29:17.355
ACTUALLY, I WAS JUST
GIVING HER AWAY.

29:17.388 --> 29:19.391
OH, MY GOD, WHY?

29:19.424 --> 29:20.491
WELL, SHE WAS
KATHERINE'S DOG.

29:20.526 --> 29:22.327
I'M NOT MUCH
OF A PET PERSON.

29:22.361 --> 29:24.029
SHE'LL BE...

29:24.063 --> 29:26.265
HAPPIER HERE.

29:26.298 --> 29:28.034
YOU, UH...

29:28.067 --> 29:30.336
YOU--YOU DIDN'T
RETURN MY CALLS.

29:30.368 --> 29:32.203
WELL, I ASSUMED THEY WERE

29:32.238 --> 29:34.105
MORE CALLS OF CONDOLENCES.

29:34.140 --> 29:35.173
WAS I WRONG?

29:35.207 --> 29:37.844
I--I--I HAD
A COUPLE QUESTIONS...

29:37.876 --> 29:40.179
ABOUT YOUR WIFE'S DEATH.

29:40.211 --> 29:42.848
WELL, I'LL SEND YOU
A TRANSCRIPT OF THE INQUEST

29:42.882 --> 29:43.982
AND THE CORONER'S REPORT.

29:44.016 --> 29:45.284
ANYTHING ELSE?

29:47.052 --> 29:49.955
SHE--SHE WAS INSURED,
WASN'T SHE?

29:49.989 --> 29:51.257
YES.

29:51.289 --> 29:53.925
THERE WAS A $2 MILLION
ACCIDENTAL DEATH POLICY.

29:53.960 --> 29:55.560
NOW, I KNOW THAT SEEMS LIKE
A LOT OF MONEY TO SOME PEOPLE,

29:55.594 --> 29:57.864
BUT CONSIDERING THE LIFESTYLE
THAT WE ENJOYED,

29:57.896 --> 29:59.030
IT WAS NOT AT ALL EXCESSIVE.

29:59.065 --> 30:01.968
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE?

30:02.000 --> 30:02.934
I FOUND THIS...

30:02.969 --> 30:06.204
THIS PIECE OF GRAVEL
IN THE TIRE OF YOUR CAR.

30:06.238 --> 30:08.207
AND, UH...

30:08.240 --> 30:09.842
IT MATCHES THE GRAVEL

30:09.875 --> 30:12.178
OUTSIDE THE PSYCHIC'S HOUSE.

30:12.211 --> 30:14.046
CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT?

30:14.079 --> 30:16.347
ARE THEY UNIQUE?

30:16.382 --> 30:19.951
OH...YES, VERY.

30:21.619 --> 30:23.588
I DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT.

30:23.622 --> 30:24.923
CAN YOU EXPLAIN IT?

30:28.027 --> 30:30.195
NOT YET.

30:30.229 --> 30:32.064
YOU KNOW, IT'S
NO BIG DEAL, SIR.

30:32.097 --> 30:34.000
WE WERE JUST CURIOUS
ABOUT THE GRAVEL.

30:34.032 --> 30:36.102
UH, ADRIAN,
I THINK WE'D BETTER GO.

30:36.134 --> 30:37.169
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE.

30:37.202 --> 30:39.204
YOU BETTER
LISTEN TO HER, MONK.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.042
YOU'RE IN MY WAY.

30:44.076 --> 30:46.144
THAT'S RIGHT.

30:46.177 --> 30:47.980
I AM.

30:50.215 --> 30:53.019
[British man]
DOLLY, READY TO GO
IN FIVE MINUTES.

30:53.051 --> 30:54.420
HEY.

30:54.452 --> 30:55.453
UGH.

30:55.487 --> 30:57.056
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM ME, MONK?

30:57.088 --> 30:59.458
DID THAT DIRECTOR
HAVE A BRITISH ACCENT?

30:59.490 --> 31:00.926
I THINK SO.

31:00.960 --> 31:01.961
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

31:01.993 --> 31:03.261
[scoffs]
FORGET IT.

31:03.295 --> 31:04.430
HE'S GAY.

31:04.462 --> 31:06.464
HE DOESN'T KNOW IT YET,
BUT...FORGET IT.

31:06.498 --> 31:08.000
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM ME, MONK?

31:08.034 --> 31:09.468
HOW ABOUT THE TRUTH
FOR A CHANGE?

31:09.500 --> 31:10.970
I HAVE BEEN
TELLING YOU THE TRUTH.

31:11.002 --> 31:13.305
OKAY? I FEEL ASLEEP,
I WOKE UP.

31:13.338 --> 31:15.074
HELLO, THERE'S
MRS. ASHCOMBE.

31:15.106 --> 31:16.107
THERE'S--
THERE'S NO SMOKING.

31:16.142 --> 31:17.910
THERE'S NO...

31:17.943 --> 31:19.144
I BELIEVE YOU, DOLLY.

31:19.178 --> 31:20.445
THANK YOU, SWEETIE.

31:20.479 --> 31:21.680
WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM?

31:21.712 --> 31:22.949
(Monk)
MY PROBLEM IS SIMPLE.

31:22.981 --> 31:25.151
[coughs]
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE!

31:25.183 --> 31:27.153
WELL, HOW DO YOU
EXPLAIN IT, THEN?

31:27.185 --> 31:29.154
MS. FLINT,
THIS IS NOT A GAME.

31:29.188 --> 31:30.622
IF YOU ARE SOMEHOW
INVOLVED--

31:30.655 --> 31:32.090
INVOLVED?

31:32.124 --> 31:33.625
HOW?

31:33.659 --> 31:34.625
WITH YOUR FRIEND,
HARRY ASHCOMBE.

31:34.660 --> 31:36.127
I MET THE MAN ONCE,

31:36.162 --> 31:37.462
FOR 30 SECONDS.

31:37.496 --> 31:38.564
YOU WERE THERE!

31:38.596 --> 31:40.031
HE'S BEEN TO YOUR HOUSE.

31:40.066 --> 31:41.299
IMPOSSIBLE.
I CAN PROVE IT.

31:41.333 --> 31:43.301
I THINK I'D REMEMBER.

31:43.335 --> 31:46.038
DOLLY, WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT PREMEDITATED,

31:46.072 --> 31:47.538
FIRST-DEGREE MURDER.

31:47.573 --> 31:49.307
I THINK ASHCOMBE
KILLED HIS WIFE,

31:49.340 --> 31:51.210
AND THEN RECRUITED YOU
TO FIND THE BODY.

31:51.242 --> 31:53.679
THAT'S ACCESSORY
AFTER THE FACT.

31:53.711 --> 31:55.981
AIDING AND ABETTING--
THESE ARE VERY SERIOUS CHARGES.

31:56.015 --> 31:57.316
I AM NOT A CRIMINAL.

31:57.348 --> 31:58.483
I'VE SEEN YOUR RAP SHEET.

31:58.517 --> 32:00.519
YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY
MOTHER TERESA.

32:00.551 --> 32:02.288
AH, THAT IS JUST
NICKEL AND DIME STUFF.

32:02.320 --> 32:04.123
COME ON!

32:04.155 --> 32:05.958
[sighs]

32:05.991 --> 32:07.058
YOU WANNA KNOW
THE TRUTH?

32:07.093 --> 32:09.127
I'M NOT SURE
MY HEART COULD TAKE IT.

32:09.161 --> 32:10.229
COME HERE.

32:12.263 --> 32:14.365
MR. MONK...

32:14.400 --> 32:16.201
WHEN I WOKE UP
ON THAT HILL,

32:16.234 --> 32:19.005
I COULDN'T
BELIEVE IT MYSELF.

32:19.038 --> 32:22.173
THE TRUTH IS...

32:22.208 --> 32:23.541
I'M A FAKE.

32:24.643 --> 32:26.112
I NEVER REALLY
HAD THE GIFT.

32:26.144 --> 32:27.679
DON'T TELL THE GIRL.

32:27.712 --> 32:30.115
I MEAN, I WANTED IT,
I PRETENDED TO HAVE IT.

32:30.148 --> 32:31.083
ONCE IN A WHILE,
WHEN I WAS A KID,

32:31.116 --> 32:32.218
I THOUGHT I ACTUALLY
DID HAVE IT.

32:32.250 --> 32:33.684
BUT THE ONLY GIFT I HAD

32:33.719 --> 32:35.386
WAS TELLING PEOPLE
WHAT THEY WANTED TO HEAR.

32:35.421 --> 32:38.589
I MEAN, IT WAS A SHAM
MY ENTIRE LIFE.

32:38.624 --> 32:40.392
[coughing]

32:40.425 --> 32:41.492
UNTIL TUESDAY.

32:43.128 --> 32:45.064
THAT WAS
THE REAL DEAL, MONK.

32:45.096 --> 32:48.067
I SWEAR ON MY SAINTED
MOTHER'S EYES,

32:48.099 --> 32:50.435
MRS. ASHCOMBE LED ME
TO THAT CAR.

32:50.469 --> 32:52.770
[cough]
I MEAN, I ALWAYS
WANTED TO HELP THE COPS,

32:52.804 --> 32:54.673
YOU KNOW, LIKE REALLY
HELP THEM ON A BIG CASE.

32:54.705 --> 32:56.241
AND I DID IT.

32:56.275 --> 32:58.076
MAYBE I'M JUST
A LATE BLOOMER.

32:58.109 --> 32:59.377
WHATEVER THE CASE--

32:59.411 --> 33:02.080
THIS TIME, I AM
TELLING YOU THE TRUTH.

33:02.114 --> 33:02.847
(director)
COME ON, COME ON.

33:02.881 --> 33:04.250
GOT A MEAL BREAK
IN AN HOUR.

33:04.282 --> 33:05.250
LET'S TRY
AND GET IT TOGETHER PLEASE!

33:05.284 --> 33:06.417
WHAT IS WRONG?

33:06.451 --> 33:07.786
YOU WANNA KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG?

33:07.818 --> 33:10.122
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT'S WRONG.

33:10.155 --> 33:13.125
I BELIEVE YOU.

33:13.159 --> 33:14.492
[ringing]

33:15.693 --> 33:16.795
HELLO?

33:16.827 --> 33:19.765
(Harry)
HAVE YOU BEEN
TALKING TO THE POLICE?

33:19.798 --> 33:20.766
(Jennifer)
NO.

33:20.798 --> 33:24.069
DON'T LIE TO ME, JENNIE.

33:33.078 --> 33:34.712
HEY, MONK?

33:34.746 --> 33:36.781
MONK, I'VE BEEN
LOOKING FOR YOU.

33:36.815 --> 33:38.416
HOW DID YOU KNOW
WE WERE HERE?

33:38.450 --> 33:40.051
SHARONA'S KID
TOLD ME.

33:40.086 --> 33:41.586
I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR YOU.

33:41.619 --> 33:43.454
UH, BENJI WANTS TO HAVE
A SLEEPOVER

33:43.489 --> 33:44.623
AND DREW CUNNINGHAM'S HOUSE.

33:44.655 --> 33:46.192
ARE HIS PARENTS
GONNA BE HOME?

33:46.224 --> 33:47.226
I DON'T KNOW.

33:47.259 --> 33:48.259
WELL, DID HE CALL
FROM DREW'S?

33:48.294 --> 33:49.661
I HAVE NO IDEA.

33:49.694 --> 33:51.630
YOU'VE BEEN TALKING
TO THE COMMISSIONER.

33:54.833 --> 33:56.468
WHERE DID YOU PARK?

33:56.501 --> 33:58.569
WHERE DID I PARK?
I PARKED UP TOP.

33:58.604 --> 34:00.571
MONK, I TOLD YOU
NOT TO TALK TO HIM.

34:00.605 --> 34:02.173
THE MAN JUST BURIED HIS WIFE.

34:02.208 --> 34:04.509
WHY DIDN'T YOU TAKE
THE SERVICE ROAD?

34:04.542 --> 34:05.711
IT COMES ALL THE WAY DOWN.

34:05.743 --> 34:06.778
I COULDN'T FIND IT.

34:06.811 --> 34:09.315
THE LAST TIME I WAS HERE,
I HAD A DRIVER, OKAY?

34:09.347 --> 34:10.815
COULDN'T FIND IT?

34:10.849 --> 34:12.117
NEITHER COULD WE.

34:12.150 --> 34:13.619
SO WHAT?

34:13.652 --> 34:14.786
DOLLY FLINT FOUND IT.

34:14.820 --> 34:16.822
SHE'D NEVER
BEEN HERE BEFORE.

34:16.855 --> 34:18.590
AND SHE FOUND IT.

34:18.623 --> 34:21.592
BEFORE DAWN?
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

34:21.626 --> 34:23.228
SHE'S PSYCHIC?

34:23.262 --> 34:24.630
A LITTLE BIRD TOLD HER?

34:24.663 --> 34:25.630
I DON'T KNOW.

34:25.664 --> 34:26.797
LELAND...

34:26.831 --> 34:28.699
I'M TALKING
TO THE BEST COP I KNOW.

34:28.733 --> 34:30.168
YOU GOTTA
GET ON BOARD HERE.

34:30.202 --> 34:32.137
ASHCOMBE WAS SLEEPING AROUND.

34:32.170 --> 34:33.639
THAT'S COMMON KNOWLEDGE.

34:33.672 --> 34:36.175
SHARONA, COULD YOU
TAKE A BREAK, PLEASE?

34:37.242 --> 34:38.844
PLEASE?

34:43.648 --> 34:45.851
HE HAD MUDDY BOOTS
IN HIS CLOSET.

34:45.884 --> 34:48.686
I HAVE MUDDY BOOTS
IN MY CLOSET.

34:48.719 --> 34:50.856
LOOK, I KNEW
YOU WERE CRAZY,

34:50.889 --> 34:52.523
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE SUICIDAL.

34:52.557 --> 34:54.525
DID YOU ACCUSE
HARRY ASHCOMBE

34:54.559 --> 34:58.297
OF MURDER TO HIS FACE?

34:58.329 --> 35:00.199
NOT IN SO MANY WORDS.

35:00.231 --> 35:03.135
[laughing]

35:03.168 --> 35:04.335
WELL, THERE GOES YOUR CAREER.

35:04.369 --> 35:06.204
WHAT CAREER?
EXACTLY.

35:06.237 --> 35:08.440
YOU WONDER WHY
YOU'RE NOT WEARING A BADGE.

35:08.474 --> 35:09.608
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED.

35:09.641 --> 35:12.911
ASHCOMBE DID HIS WIFE,
BUT HE HAD A PROBLEM.

35:12.943 --> 35:15.581
THERE WAS A MUDSLIDE
THAT NIGHT.

35:15.614 --> 35:16.847
THE CAR WAS BURIED.

35:16.882 --> 35:19.751
HE COULDN'T COLLECT A DIME
UNTIL THEY FOUND HER.

35:19.784 --> 35:21.152
WHAT COULD HE DO?

35:21.186 --> 35:21.887
HE COULDN'T JUST SAY,

35:21.920 --> 35:24.255
"MAYBE WE SHOULD
DIG OVER THERE."

35:24.289 --> 35:28.226
SOMEBODY ELSE
HAD TO FIND HER.

35:28.260 --> 35:29.728
SO HE PAID DOLLY FLINT?

35:29.760 --> 35:30.829
TOO DANGEROUS.

35:30.862 --> 35:33.632
SHE'D NEVER
KEEP HER MOUTH SHUT.

35:33.664 --> 35:35.634
ASHCOMBE...

35:35.666 --> 35:39.871
ARRANGED FOR HER
TO FIND THE BODY.

35:39.905 --> 35:42.208
RIGHT, BUT HOW
DID HE DO THAT?

35:42.240 --> 35:45.577
I THINK I KNOW.

35:45.610 --> 35:47.778
CAN YOU PROVE IT?

35:47.813 --> 36:01.293
ONLY IF YOU HELP ME.

36:01.327 --> 36:04.295
(woman)
EVERYONE, PLEASE CONCENTRATE.

36:04.329 --> 36:05.697
OH, IT'S FAINT, BUT--

36:05.731 --> 36:06.697
WHAT IS THIS?

36:06.731 --> 36:07.699
IT'S COMING THROUGH.

36:07.733 --> 36:08.867
LELAND, WHAT'S
GOING ON HERE?

36:08.900 --> 36:11.336
WHO LET YOU IN?
YOU DID.

36:11.369 --> 36:12.871
I TALKED TO YOUR LAWYER,
HARRY.

36:12.903 --> 36:14.539
WE HAVE FULL,
UNRESTRICTED ACCESS.

36:14.572 --> 36:16.242
I THOUGHT YOU WERE JUST
GONNA LOOK AROUND.

36:16.275 --> 36:17.976
SHH, PLEASE.

36:18.009 --> 36:20.646
HER AURA IS VERY STRONG.

36:20.679 --> 36:22.813
SHE'S HERE.

36:22.847 --> 36:24.916
I CAN FEEL HER.

36:24.949 --> 36:26.885
COMPLETE THE RING.

36:26.918 --> 36:28.820
[exhales]

36:31.523 --> 36:33.625
[exhales]

36:33.659 --> 36:35.693
MR. MONK, COMPLETE THE RING.

36:37.528 --> 36:39.331
UH, I THINK
THE RING IS FINE.

36:39.364 --> 36:42.199
MR. MONK, WE NEED YOU.

36:44.369 --> 36:46.405
COMPLETE THE RING.

36:52.943 --> 36:54.313
[exhales]

36:54.346 --> 36:55.914
WHO AM I SPEAKING TO?

36:55.947 --> 36:56.882
TELL ME.

36:56.914 --> 36:58.317
WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

36:58.349 --> 37:00.751
THERE'S A WOMAN
REPORTED MISSING

37:00.786 --> 37:02.954
IN SAN ANSELMO.

37:02.987 --> 37:06.458
TRAVEL AGENT, 32-YEAR-OLD
JENNIE ZEPPETTELLI.

37:06.492 --> 37:07.458
JENNIE?

37:07.492 --> 37:08.927
YEAH.

37:08.960 --> 37:09.860
WE CONTACTED MS. FLINT

37:09.894 --> 37:11.762
AFTER THE SUCCESS
SHE HAD WITH YOUR WIFE.

37:11.797 --> 37:13.030
WE THOUGHT WE'D
USE HER AGAIN.

37:13.063 --> 37:14.400
AND?

37:14.432 --> 37:16.768
AND...SHE'S BEEN
ON HER TRAIL ALL DAY.

37:16.802 --> 37:19.737
WE FOLLOWED HER HERE.
WE THINK SHE'S IN YOUR HOUSE.

37:19.771 --> 37:20.905
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

37:20.938 --> 37:22.007
JENNIE...

37:22.039 --> 37:24.009
IS THAT YOU?

37:24.041 --> 37:27.378
SHE'S HERE.

37:27.413 --> 37:30.282
OH...SHE'S IN PAIN.

37:30.315 --> 37:32.483
I CAN FEEL HER.

37:40.692 --> 37:42.927
THERE'S SOMETHING
IN THIS ROOM.

37:44.829 --> 37:46.831
[gasps]
LOOK.

37:46.864 --> 37:48.599
SHARONA, DON'T TOUCH IT!

37:56.442 --> 37:57.708
SANDAL, SIZE SIX.

37:57.742 --> 37:59.545
ACCORDING TO HER SISTER,

37:59.577 --> 38:02.079
SHE WAS WEARING SANDALS
WHEN SHE DISAPPEARED.

38:02.112 --> 38:03.382
IS THAT BLOOD?

38:03.414 --> 38:04.483
YEAH, LOOKS LIKE IT.

38:04.516 --> 38:05.583
(Leland)
BAG IT.

38:05.617 --> 38:08.487
THIS IS INSANE.
HOW DID THAT GET HERE?

38:08.519 --> 38:10.621
SHE'S CLOSE.
SHE'S VERY CLOSE.

38:10.655 --> 38:12.757
UHH! OHH!

38:12.791 --> 38:13.824
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

38:13.858 --> 38:14.992
STAY AWAY.

38:15.025 --> 38:16.661
IT'S JENNIE.
SHE'S HERE.

38:16.695 --> 38:17.795
THERE'S NOTHING HERE!

38:19.731 --> 38:21.766
[grunting]

38:21.800 --> 38:23.601
(Monk)
WHAT IS IT, DOLLY?

38:23.635 --> 38:25.836
OHH...
WHAT IS IT?

38:25.871 --> 38:27.739
[Dolly breathing hard]

38:27.773 --> 38:32.577
IT'S BLOOD.

38:32.610 --> 38:34.945
AND HAIR.

38:34.980 --> 38:36.914
HUMAN.
HUMAN.

38:36.947 --> 38:38.916
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

38:38.949 --> 38:39.951
LIEUTENANT--

38:39.985 --> 38:41.018
I GOT IT.

38:41.052 --> 38:43.489
JENNIE...
SHE'S CALLING ME.

38:43.521 --> 38:45.322
I'M COMING!

38:57.802 --> 38:59.103
(Dolly)
OH, NO.

38:59.137 --> 39:00.938
OH, NO.
OH, MY GOD!

39:00.972 --> 39:02.007
OH, DEAR GOD, NO!

39:02.039 --> 39:04.009
(Harry)
JENNIE! OH, MY GOD, NO.

39:04.041 --> 39:05.911
I SWEAR!
STAND BACK,
COMMISSIONER.

39:05.943 --> 39:06.844
THIS IS A CRIME SCENE.

39:06.878 --> 39:08.914
HE DID IT.

39:08.947 --> 39:09.914
HE KILLED HER.

39:09.947 --> 39:11.048
ME? ARE YOU CRAZY?

39:11.081 --> 39:12.650
I LOVED THIS WOMAN!

39:12.684 --> 39:14.152
(Dolly)
HE INVITED HER HERE.

39:14.184 --> 39:16.588
SHE SAID IT WAS OVER.
HE EXPLODED.

39:16.621 --> 39:17.956
SHE TRIED TO RUN AWAY.

39:17.989 --> 39:19.657
BUT HE CHASED HER DOWN!

39:19.690 --> 39:21.992
NO!
HE GRABBED THE POKER.

39:22.027 --> 39:23.929
AND THEN HE STRADDLED HER,

39:23.961 --> 39:25.996
AND HE WAS JUST POUNDING!

39:26.030 --> 39:27.565
JUST POUNDING HER!

39:27.599 --> 39:28.900
NO, SHE'S CRAZY!

39:28.934 --> 39:31.836
SHE SAYS NOW, AT LEAST
SHE CAN BE WITH ABIGAIL.

39:31.869 --> 39:35.974
ABIGAIL WAS WHAT SHE NAMED
HER UNBORN BABY.

39:36.007 --> 39:39.978
LAST SUMMER, YOU MADE HER
HAVE AN ABORTION.

39:40.010 --> 39:43.914
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

39:43.949 --> 39:45.016
(Monk)
SHE KNOWS EVERYTHING.

39:45.050 --> 39:47.552
SHE'S PSYCHIC.

39:47.585 --> 39:48.987
LELAND, DON'T LISTEN TO HER.

39:49.019 --> 39:50.588
THIS--THIS IS SOME KIND
OF A TRICK!

39:50.621 --> 39:51.822
SHE'S A FAKE!

39:51.856 --> 39:53.692
SHE'S NOT A FAKE.
YES, SHE IS!

39:53.724 --> 39:54.860
SHE FOUND YOUR WIFE'S BODY.

39:54.893 --> 39:55.860
NO, SHE DIDN'T!

39:55.893 --> 39:57.528
SHE DID--I WAS THERE.

39:57.563 --> 39:58.829
NO, NO, SHE DIDN'T
FIND ANYTHING!

39:58.864 --> 40:00.865
I DROVE HER THERE!

40:07.472 --> 40:10.208
YOU DROVE HER?

40:10.240 --> 40:11.610
IS THAT WHAT YOU SAID?

40:11.643 --> 40:13.911
DID YOU HEAR THAT,
CAPTAIN?

40:13.945 --> 40:14.846
I--I--

40:14.880 --> 40:17.148
LOOK, LELAND...

40:22.119 --> 40:23.954
HELLO, HARRY.

40:23.989 --> 40:26.023
I TOLD YOU YOU'D BE SORRY.

40:26.056 --> 40:29.059
(Monk)
WHEN I TOLD JENNIE WHAT
WE WERE TRYING TO DO HERE,

40:29.094 --> 40:30.929
SHE WAS ANXIOUS TO HELP.

40:30.961 --> 40:33.831
SHE KNEW YOU HAD
TO BE STOPPED.

40:33.864 --> 40:36.934
A MUDSLIDE.

40:36.967 --> 40:39.938
THAT WAS YOUR PROBLEM.

40:39.971 --> 40:44.710
SOMEBODY OTHER THAN YOURSELF
HAD TO FIND KATHERINE'S BODY.

40:44.742 --> 40:49.213
SO YOU WENT LOOKING
WITH JUST THE RIGHT PSYCHIC.

40:49.246 --> 40:52.751
AND DOLLY FLINT
WAS THE PERFECT CHOICE.

40:52.784 --> 40:54.753
FROM HER FILE, YOU KNEW
THAT SHE TOOK MEDICATION

40:54.786 --> 40:56.054
TO HELP HER SLEEP.

40:56.086 --> 40:58.590
WHAT DID YOU USE, CHLOROFORM?

40:58.623 --> 41:01.860
SOMETHING
TO KEEP HER SLEEPY?

41:01.893 --> 41:03.961
PUT ON A WIG.

41:03.994 --> 41:06.664
YOU DROVE HER
TO THE CRASH SITE.

41:06.697 --> 41:10.768
YOU EVEN RAN A RED LIGHT OR TWO
TO MAKE SURE YOU WERE SEEN.

41:10.802 --> 41:12.971
IN THE MORNING,
SHE WOKE UP...

41:13.003 --> 41:15.974
AND FOUND YOUR WIFE.

41:16.007 --> 41:19.577
I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY.

41:19.610 --> 41:20.646
THAT'S QUITE
ALL RIGHT, SIR.

41:20.679 --> 41:23.014
YOU'VE SAID ENOUGH.

41:23.047 --> 41:24.882
HARRY...

41:24.916 --> 41:27.619
I'M GONNA ADVISE YOU
OF YOUR RIGHTS.

41:27.652 --> 41:31.222
YOU HAVE...THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

41:31.255 --> 41:33.123
ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN
BE USED AGAINST YOU

41:33.157 --> 41:38.028
IN A COURT OF LAW.

41:38.063 --> 41:39.630
HOW DID YOU KNOW
SHE WAS A FAKE?

41:39.664 --> 41:41.266
[laughing]
OH, DOLLY.
DOLLY FLINT.

41:41.298 --> 41:42.233
THEY'RE ALL FAKES.

41:42.266 --> 41:45.170
YOU GOTTA BE A LITTLE
SKEPTICAL, SHARONA.

41:45.202 --> 41:47.271
OTHERWISE, YOU END UP
BELIEVING IN EVERYTHING--

41:47.304 --> 41:52.043
UFOs, ELVES...
INCOME TAX REBATES.

41:52.077 --> 41:53.978
WELL, IT'S BETTER
THAN BELIEVING IN NOTHING.

41:54.012 --> 41:55.646
I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU.

41:55.681 --> 41:56.914
THANK YOU.

41:58.215 --> 41:59.617
[gasps]
DON'T PET, DON'T PET--

41:59.650 --> 42:01.686
OH, IT'S SO--
COME HERE, COME HERE.

42:01.719 --> 42:02.887
WINSTON,
HERE BOY.

42:02.920 --> 42:05.155
IS HE YOURS?
YES, HE IS.

42:05.190 --> 42:06.925
WHAT KIND OF DOG
IS HE?

42:06.958 --> 42:10.295
[British accent]
UH, NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE,
THAT'S WHAT KIND.

42:10.327 --> 42:11.329
ARE YOU BRITISH?

42:11.362 --> 42:12.329
UH, GUILTY.

42:12.362 --> 42:13.331
[both laugh]

42:13.364 --> 42:15.900
OH, GOD, UM,
I'M SHARONA.

42:15.934 --> 42:18.168
HI.
AND THIS IS MY FRIEN--

42:18.202 --> 42:19.938
ADRIAN, UM,
ADRIAN MONK.

42:19.971 --> 42:22.273
AND, UM, YOU ARE...

42:22.306 --> 42:25.610
DANIEL.
OH, DANIEL.

42:25.643 --> 42:26.878
WITH A "D."

42:26.911 --> 42:29.748
UH, ADRIAN, I NOTICE
YOU TOUCHING ALL THE POLES.

42:29.780 --> 42:31.916
IS, UH, IS THAT
AN AMERICAN THING?

42:31.949 --> 42:34.085
YES, IT'S AN AMERICAN
TRADITION.

42:34.119 --> 42:35.721
I'M TOUCHING
ALL THE POLES

42:35.753 --> 42:37.989
BECAUSE I'M PROUD
TO BE AN AMERICAN.

42:38.023 --> 42:39.625
OH, HEH.

42:39.657 --> 42:43.228
EXCUSE MY ASKING,
BUT ARE YOU TWO...TOGETHER?

42:43.260 --> 42:44.762
[laughs hysterically]

42:44.795 --> 42:45.996
ME AND MONK?

42:46.030 --> 42:48.800
[laughing]

42:48.833 --> 42:50.635
NO. NO, WE'RE NOT.

42:50.668 --> 42:52.971
IT'S NOT THAT--
NOT THAT FUNNY.

42:53.003 --> 42:54.940
[laughing]
YES, IT IS.

42:56.842 --> 42:56.907
