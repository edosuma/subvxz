Mate, I'm... I'm so sorry.

03:46.210 --> 03:47.210
I'm not your mate.

03:47.210 --> 03:48.620
Mates don't lie to each other.

03:48.620 --> 03:50.420
And they definitely don't
move in on your girlfriend.

03:50.420 --> 03:52.040
So you heard what I said to her?

03:52.040 --> 03:54.210
Every word. You know...

03:54.210 --> 03:55.960
It was selfish for you
to tell Maia how you felt.

03:55.960 --> 03:57.830
You made
her question everything.

03:57.830 --> 03:58.830
Including me.
That's not what I was--

03:58.830 --> 04:00.210
No! Look, just...

04:00.210 --> 04:01.000
save it.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.040
From this moment on,

04:02.040 --> 04:03.330
we are strictly Praetor-Praetee.

04:05.540 --> 04:07.420
Fine. Well, in that case, here.

04:09.580 --> 04:11.670
The Praetor finally determined
what the symbol on your head is.

04:16.750 --> 04:18.250
"The Mark of Cain"?

04:18.250 --> 04:19.540
As in Cain and Abel?

04:19.540 --> 04:22.000
Yeah. The salt at Lilith's
hideout was the final piece

04:22.000 --> 04:23.790
of the puzzle.
It led our archivists

04:23.790 --> 04:25.500
to biblical sources,
where they found this.

04:25.500 --> 04:27.460
"Whosoever slayeth Cain

04:27.460 --> 04:29.620
shall have revenge
taken upon him sevenfold."

04:29.620 --> 04:30.750
Whenever someone tries
to hurt you,

04:30.750 --> 04:32.460
they get hurt
seven times as bad.

04:32.460 --> 04:35.290
Lilith's disciples came
at you with death blows.

04:35.290 --> 04:37.380
Hence...
Death, sevenfold.

04:37.380 --> 04:38.830
You know, we learned
about the Mark of Cain

04:38.830 --> 04:40.710
in Hebrew school.
God cursed Cain

04:40.710 --> 04:42.040
for killing his brother,
so Cain would have

04:42.040 --> 04:43.420
to wander the world in misery.

04:43.420 --> 04:44.750
Well, actually, our sources show

04:44.750 --> 04:47.000
that ancient Seelies
gave Cain his Mark.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.830
That explains
why it's so twisted.

04:49.830 --> 04:51.960
Why would the Seelie Queen
want to curse me?

04:51.960 --> 04:53.790
Maybe she wanted
the ultimate bodyguard.

04:56.250 --> 04:58.250
What if we use the Mark
to break Clary out of prison?

04:58.250 --> 05:00.580
No one can stop me.
I'm basically invincible.

05:00.580 --> 05:01.710
I know, but let's
just think this through.

05:01.710 --> 05:03.580
Any soldier that came at you
would be blown to bits.

05:03.580 --> 05:04.920
You really want
that blood on your hands?

05:06.170 --> 05:08.750
Blood. Right.

05:08.750 --> 05:10.170
How long since you've eaten?

05:10.170 --> 05:11.250
I don't remember.

05:11.250 --> 05:13.380
You know, I've been
so worried about Maia,

05:13.380 --> 05:15.620
and now Clary, that I...

05:15.620 --> 05:17.380
haven't really thought about it.

05:17.380 --> 05:18.790
It's empty.

05:18.790 --> 05:20.540
I can run and grab something--
No.

05:20.540 --> 05:22.460
I can get my own bag.
No, no. Hey, hey.

05:22.460 --> 05:23.750
Simon, let me do this.

05:23.750 --> 05:25.670
Hey, if not as
your mate, then...

05:25.670 --> 05:27.120
then as your roommate.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.170
OK?

05:38.960 --> 05:40.920
You're the head
of the Institute.

05:40.920 --> 05:42.710
Can't you demand to know
what happened with Clary?

05:42.710 --> 05:45.420
I've tried. The Council
is freezing me out.

05:46.460 --> 05:48.380
Sorry to interrupt.

05:48.380 --> 05:49.380
Magnus.

05:49.380 --> 05:51.710
Looks like someone
needs a coffee.

05:51.710 --> 05:52.750
Oh, no thank you.

05:52.750 --> 05:53.880
I already had six.

05:53.880 --> 05:55.920
So, I was up all night

05:55.920 --> 05:58.540
researching the dark magic that
Lilith has been using on Jace.

05:59.540 --> 06:01.210
I may have found
a way to free him.

06:01.210 --> 06:02.960
What

06:02.960 --> 06:04.460
Based on your descriptions,

06:04.460 --> 06:07.620
it seems Lilith has Jace locked
in some kind of a mental cage,

06:07.620 --> 06:10.210
and the only solution
is breaking that cage

06:10.210 --> 06:12.620
by blasting Jace
with enough magic

06:12.620 --> 06:14.460
to eviscerate her presence.

06:14.460 --> 06:16.170
Do you have the power
to do that?

06:16.170 --> 06:18.000
No, but I will.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.170
In the Book of the White,
I found a synthesis spell

06:20.170 --> 06:22.120
that'll allow me
to temporarily channel

06:22.120 --> 06:24.830
the magic of other warlocks.
How many warlocks?

06:24.830 --> 06:27.420
I'll need at least about a dozen
to match Lilith's strength.

06:27.420 --> 06:29.380
I'll have to call in
some favors, but...

06:29.380 --> 06:30.670
this should work.

06:30.670 --> 06:32.580
There's just one tiny catch.

06:32.580 --> 06:34.000
We'll need
the High Warlock's permission

06:34.000 --> 06:35.500
to organize something
on this scale.

06:38.750 --> 06:40.750
JIA: Trevor Hayes.

06:40.750 --> 06:42.620
You are guilty
of violent assault

06:42.620 --> 06:44.620
on 13 mundanes.
Red?

06:44.620 --> 06:46.580
Red?

06:46.580 --> 06:47.750
Is that you?

06:50.250 --> 06:51.500
Relax.

06:51.500 --> 06:53.670
The cuffs suppress
warlock abilities.

06:53.670 --> 06:55.960
I couldn't hurt you
if I wanted to,

06:55.960 --> 06:57.500
not that I would.

06:57.500 --> 06:58.790
I heard what you did,

06:58.790 --> 07:01.290
stopping Valentine's wish.

07:02.540 --> 07:03.960
You don't deserve this.

07:12.540 --> 07:14.540
No one does.

07:15.920 --> 07:17.080
This is barbaric.

07:17.080 --> 07:19.620
Even the barbarians
weren't this cruel.

07:19.620 --> 07:21.710
After everything I've done,

07:21.710 --> 07:22.960
this is how it ends...

07:23.960 --> 07:26.750
...burned at the stake
for not doing magic.

07:26.750 --> 07:28.960
What are you talking about?

07:28.960 --> 07:31.460
The Consul moved up my execution

07:31.460 --> 07:34.040
because I refused to perform
a spell for her.

07:34.040 --> 07:36.420
The Clave hires warlocks
all the time.

07:36.420 --> 07:38.250
Why ask you?

07:38.250 --> 07:40.290
Because necromancy
is my specialty.

07:40.290 --> 07:42.620
But even I know
no good would come

07:42.620 --> 07:45.040
from resurrecting
Valentine Morgenstern.

07:46.960 --> 07:48.460
Jia asked you
to resurrect Valentine?

07:52.620 --> 07:53.790
Why?

07:53.790 --> 07:55.830
She wanted to question him
about a demon.

07:56.880 --> 07:58.380
Lilith.

07:58.380 --> 08:00.080
She tried to dig him up.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.580
But I said I don't care

08:01.580 --> 08:03.920
if Lilith
is the devil incarnate.

08:03.920 --> 08:06.670
Anyone is better
than that Circle bastard.

08:06.670 --> 08:08.920
He took my Madzie away from me.

08:08.920 --> 08:10.710
Let him rot.

08:28.290 --> 08:29.790
The weapon you requested.

08:29.790 --> 08:32.500
This should keep Simon
busy for a few days.

08:32.500 --> 08:35.620
And keep the Mark of Cain
far from Jonathan's rebirth.

08:44.380 --> 08:46.580
Wake up.

08:47.580 --> 08:48.920
Where the hell am I?!

08:48.920 --> 08:51.580
Somewhere safe. You're OK now.

08:51.920 --> 08:54.080
I'm not OK. I was
walking with the Praetors,

08:54.080 --> 08:55.620
and that guy killed them
and then stuffed me

08:55.620 --> 08:56.620
into a duffel bag!

08:56.620 --> 08:57.880
He saved your life.

08:57.880 --> 08:59.710
You're welcome.

08:59.710 --> 09:02.790
My apologies for the rough
mode of transport,

09:02.790 --> 09:04.290
but we know you didn't inherit

09:04.290 --> 09:06.580
your Sire's immunity
to sunlight.

09:08.710 --> 09:10.040
My sire?

09:10.040 --> 09:11.580
You know Simon?

09:11.580 --> 09:14.540
The Daylighter recently killed
two of my progeny.

09:15.750 --> 09:17.960
Oh, that doesn't sound
like my Simon.

09:21.620 --> 09:23.880
I know that you loved Simon.

09:23.880 --> 09:26.170
That you devoted
yourself to him.

09:26.170 --> 09:29.170
And he promised he to protect
you, only to send you away.

09:29.170 --> 09:30.790
How do you know about that?

09:30.790 --> 09:32.710
I know a great many things.

09:33.750 --> 09:35.580
Well, he thought that, um...

09:35.580 --> 09:36.920
He thought that I was
out of control.

09:36.920 --> 09:38.580
As opposed to under his?

09:41.120 --> 09:43.750
My ex once told me
the same thing.

09:43.750 --> 09:46.040
And I wanted to change
to please him.

09:46.040 --> 09:47.830
Just like you.

09:47.830 --> 09:49.330
But then I realized

09:49.330 --> 09:50.790
that no woman should

09:50.790 --> 09:53.500
ever... kneel to a man.

09:55.080 --> 09:56.210
Yeah. Well, damn right.

09:56.210 --> 09:58.000
He just doesn't appreciate

09:58.000 --> 09:59.670
the bond that you have.

09:59.670 --> 10:02.000
But you can change that.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.460
I can?

10:03.460 --> 10:04.880
Oh, yes.

10:06.040 --> 10:08.080
Do as I say,

10:08.080 --> 10:10.620
and Simon will kneel to you.

10:25.790 --> 10:27.580
Clarissa Fairchild.

10:27.580 --> 10:28.960
Ascend.

10:38.580 --> 10:41.880
You are guilty of using
the Angel Raziel's one wish

10:41.880 --> 10:43.540
for personal gain...

10:45.330 --> 10:48.170
...and of knowingly deceiving
the Clave on the matter.

10:48.170 --> 10:50.290
Do you have any last words?

10:53.920 --> 10:56.420
I know what Iris Rouse
refused to do for you.

10:58.500 --> 10:59.790
I can do it.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.710
What are you saying?

11:02.710 --> 11:05.420
I've created runes
that can open portals,

11:05.420 --> 11:09.540
take down wards, and deactivate
Mortal Instruments.

11:11.920 --> 11:14.000
I can bring Valentine
back to life.

11:24.080 --> 11:26.000
We inspected Valentine's
body and grave.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.710
There's nothing
Lilith could want...

11:28.710 --> 11:30.710
other than the man himself.

11:30.710 --> 11:32.670
He despised demons
more than anyone.

11:33.880 --> 11:35.000
What's the connection?

11:35.000 --> 11:37.290
We're about to find out.

11:51.210 --> 11:53.620
How exactly does
this rune power work?

11:55.920 --> 11:58.790
Sometimes... it comes to me
when I'm in danger.

12:01.420 --> 12:03.420
And sometimes,
I have to reach for it.

12:20.460 --> 12:22.580
I'm... feeling some resistance.

12:24.710 --> 12:26.580
Stop! This is not
the will of the Angels.

12:27.580 --> 12:28.920
But it's my will.

12:51.710 --> 12:53.920
Thank you all for showing up
on such short notice.

12:53.920 --> 12:55.380
Anyone got eyes on Maia?

12:55.380 --> 12:57.710
She left town yesterday.
Personal reasons.

12:57.710 --> 12:59.170
You didn't know?

13:02.580 --> 13:04.380
We're going on a mission
without her.

13:04.380 --> 13:06.880
I called you all here
because Clary Fairchild

13:06.880 --> 13:08.290
has been arrested by the Clave.

13:08.290 --> 13:10.500
They're holding her
in a secure facility in Idris.

13:10.500 --> 13:12.000
And we're gonna break her out.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.620
Once a Shadowhunter,
always a Shadowhunter.

13:14.620 --> 13:16.380
Let me get this straight.

13:16.380 --> 13:18.460
You want us to go to Idris
to rescue a Nephilim?

13:18.460 --> 13:19.880
She's my daughter.

13:19.880 --> 13:21.880
But you know the second
we walk into Idris,

13:21.880 --> 13:23.080
we'll set off the wards

13:23.080 --> 13:24.540
and be put down like dogs.

13:24.540 --> 13:27.250
Not if we go through
the Brocelind Forest.

13:27.250 --> 13:29.210
The wolves there have
a tactical advantage.

13:29.210 --> 13:30.210
All right. Well, partner up
with them.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.420
We're staying here in New York.

13:31.420 --> 13:33.170
Clary killed Valentine.

13:33.170 --> 13:35.580
If it wasn't for her,
the Downworld would be extinct.

13:35.580 --> 13:38.040
Look, we're grateful
she saved our lives.

13:38.040 --> 13:39.500
But that's exactly why we're not

13:39.500 --> 13:41.040
running into a suicide mission.

13:44.620 --> 13:47.380
This isn't a request.
It's an order.

13:47.380 --> 13:49.880
We're not soldiers
in your personal army, Luke.

13:49.880 --> 13:52.750
We're family. Can you
honestly stand there and say

13:52.750 --> 13:55.330
that Clary's life is more
important than all of ours?

14:02.920 --> 14:03.960
I get it. She's your daughter.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.460
But we're your family too.

14:07.460 --> 14:08.880
Hmm?

14:10.040 --> 14:11.460
You walk out that door...

14:12.880 --> 14:14.330
...you lose this pack for good.

14:38.500 --> 14:40.000
What's happening?

14:40.000 --> 14:41.170
WHERE AM I?

14:41.170 --> 14:42.540
You're in the Gard.

14:42.540 --> 14:44.120
How is that possible?

14:47.830 --> 14:49.460
Clarissa?

14:49.460 --> 14:51.080
Your return is only temporary.

14:51.080 --> 14:53.040
You'll be back
in hell soon enough.

14:53.040 --> 14:54.210
I wasn't in hell.

14:54.210 --> 14:56.040
I was in the dark.

14:57.250 --> 14:59.460
There was nothing but shadows,

15:01.040 --> 15:03.210
Oh! I was a shadow.

15:03.210 --> 15:04.960
And I knew it was all over.

15:06.290 --> 15:08.000
It's time for the questioning.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.040
Please escort Ms. Fairchild
back to the courtyard.

15:11.210 --> 15:12.790
Her work is done.

15:14.170 --> 15:15.750
Clarissa...

15:15.750 --> 15:17.380
is the only one I will speak to.

15:17.380 --> 15:20.880
I will not tell you a thing.

15:20.880 --> 15:22.120
Do you understand?

15:25.040 --> 15:26.380
But my daughter...

15:33.000 --> 15:35.120
Clary will question you first.

15:35.120 --> 15:36.710
But the Clave will be watching.

15:50.120 --> 15:53.000
Lilith, Queen of Edom,
here in New York City?

15:53.000 --> 15:55.210
That's a terrifying prospect.

15:55.210 --> 15:57.920
It is indeed. My Institute is
hunting her as we speak.

15:57.920 --> 16:00.250
But she's proven
rather... elusive.

16:00.250 --> 16:01.460
More tea?

16:01.460 --> 16:02.710
Yes, please.

16:02.710 --> 16:04.880
Té rojo is my favorite.

16:06.880 --> 16:10.380
Lilith has taken a lieutenant
using some form of mind control.

16:10.380 --> 16:13.120
A Shadowhunter. Our goal
is to break him free,

16:13.120 --> 16:15.290
so that he can tell us
everything about her plans,

16:15.290 --> 16:17.210
her location and her weaknesses.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.290
But this will require a...

16:19.290 --> 16:21.380
great deal of magic.

16:21.380 --> 16:24.330
You want my warlocks
to confront this lieutenant?

16:24.330 --> 16:25.830
No. Only one.

16:25.830 --> 16:27.250
Magnus Bane.

16:27.250 --> 16:29.080
He has found a spell

16:29.080 --> 16:31.960
that allows him to channel
the magic of other warlocks.

16:31.960 --> 16:33.540
He'll be the only one in danger.

16:33.540 --> 16:36.620
Of course, we would
never move forward

16:36.620 --> 16:37.830
without your blessing.

16:40.290 --> 16:42.250
The Shadowhunters have
a duty to fight demons,

16:42.250 --> 16:43.920
but the warlocks do not.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.120
By helping you, we risk
making an enemy

16:46.120 --> 16:47.210
of a Queen of Hell.

16:47.210 --> 16:49.670
Lilith isn't even
a threat to us.

16:49.670 --> 16:51.170
Yes, she is.

16:51.170 --> 16:53.040
She corrupted the ley lines,

16:53.040 --> 16:54.540
endangering warlocks
all over the city.

16:54.540 --> 16:56.080
That issue was resolved.

16:56.080 --> 16:57.500
Yes.

16:57.500 --> 16:59.080
And while you gladly
took the credit,

16:59.080 --> 17:02.460
we both know who really
purified those ley lines.

17:04.079 --> 17:06.460
Maybe your people deserve
to know the truth too.

17:08.250 --> 17:10.710
I risked my Institute
helping the warlocks.

17:10.710 --> 17:12.790
If you have any honour,

17:12.790 --> 17:14.040
you'll return the favor.

17:16.329 --> 17:18.040
El honor es en el acto.

17:19.250 --> 17:21.880
I will speak to my people
about this at once.

17:27.170 --> 17:28.710
Rabbi Abromowitz.

17:28.710 --> 17:31.330
Simon Lewis. Shalom.

17:31.330 --> 17:32.670
Yeah, that's... that's... yeah.

17:32.670 --> 17:34.290
Um, thank you. My mom's
doing very well.

17:34.290 --> 17:36.670
Uh, I was calling
with a question, actually,

17:36.670 --> 17:39.080
about the...
about the Book of Genesis.

17:39.080 --> 17:40.710
Yeah. Um...

17:40.710 --> 17:42.120
Do you remember
the Mark of Cain?

17:43.120 --> 17:44.620
I know how he got it,
I just want to know

17:44.620 --> 17:46.380
how did he get rid of it?

17:48.250 --> 17:49.670
He never did.
That's... that's...

17:49.670 --> 17:52.500
That's fantastic.
Thanks... thanks anyway, Rabbi.

18:02.460 --> 18:03.670
Maia?

18:06.080 --> 18:07.330
Heidi.

18:07.330 --> 18:09.880
I didn't know they let you make
calls in the Praetor Lupus.

18:09.880 --> 18:12.250
[Yeah, the Praetor
wasn't really]

18:18.500 --> 18:20.000
That's funny, I...

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
I don't see you.

18:23.380 --> 18:26.170
[You were such a precious
little baby!]

18:26.170 --> 18:27.290
[I could look
at these photos all day.]

18:27.290 --> 18:28.420
You're at my house?

18:34.580 --> 18:37.290
Simon! That was fast.

18:41.420 --> 18:43.040
But I'm faster.

18:45.170 --> 18:46.250
Have a seat.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.420
OK, just... please, Heidi,

18:48.420 --> 18:50.790
don't... don't hurt them.

18:50.790 --> 18:52.330
I'm the one who tricked you.

18:52.330 --> 18:53.420
I'm the one
who got you sent away.

18:53.420 --> 18:54.580
It's my fault.

18:54.580 --> 18:55.960
OK? So just...

18:55.960 --> 18:57.330
I forgive you, Simon.

18:57.330 --> 18:59.290
You do?

18:59.290 --> 19:01.620
There's nothing
you could ever do

19:01.620 --> 19:03.500
that would make me
love you less.

19:05.380 --> 19:07.210
Can you say the same about them?

19:07.210 --> 19:09.620
Of course. They're my...
they're my family.

19:09.620 --> 19:11.380
They'll always love me.

19:11.380 --> 19:12.670
Mm-hmm.

19:12.670 --> 19:14.920
Then why haven't you
told them your big secret?

19:14.920 --> 19:16.250
Hmm?

19:16.250 --> 19:17.250
Hmm?

19:17.250 --> 19:19.000
I think that you're scared.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.420
Deep down,

19:20.420 --> 19:22.290
you fear that they'll never...

19:22.290 --> 19:24.000
accept the real you.

19:28.380 --> 19:30.040
So, let's find out.

19:31.210 --> 19:34.580
Time for a good old
family dinner.

19:39.750 --> 19:42.000
So you created
a Necromancy Rune,

19:42.000 --> 19:43.170
just like that?

19:43.170 --> 19:45.460
I underestimated you.

19:45.460 --> 19:48.620
Clarissa, you are
my greatest creation.

19:48.620 --> 19:51.120
Not Jonathan, not Jace.

19:51.120 --> 19:52.500
You are.

19:52.500 --> 19:55.000
I was never yours.

19:57.380 --> 19:58.710
Enough.

20:00.420 --> 20:01.540
How do you know Lilith?

20:01.540 --> 20:03.040
What makes you think I do?

20:03.040 --> 20:05.290
She's in this realm,
planning something big,

20:05.290 --> 20:07.670
and it involves
digging up your grave.

20:07.670 --> 20:09.170
I know nothing about that.

20:09.170 --> 20:10.170
Liar.

20:10.170 --> 20:11.880
I do have a decent alibi.

20:11.880 --> 20:15.080
You tell me, or I swear I--
Or what?

20:15.080 --> 20:17.330
Jia's men will kill me?
That's inevitable.

20:17.330 --> 20:19.460
Why use my few extra minutes

20:19.460 --> 20:21.380
of life to help the Clave, huh?

20:21.380 --> 20:23.120
This isn't about
helping the Clave.

20:23.120 --> 20:25.420
This is about...
doing what's right!

20:25.420 --> 20:28.330
You still believe
in stopping demons, don't you?

20:30.330 --> 20:31.620
Prove it.

20:35.330 --> 20:38.080
I don't know why Lilith
wanted to exhume me.

20:39.210 --> 20:40.420
But I admit

20:40.420 --> 20:42.290
I did summon her once,
many years ago.

20:42.290 --> 20:45.040
Why?
She is the mother of all demons,

20:45.040 --> 20:48.120
and that makes her blood
a very potent ingredient.

20:49.790 --> 20:51.460
So I requested a vial.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
For Jonathan.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.380
Mm-hmm.

20:57.540 --> 20:59.420
You injected him.

20:59.420 --> 21:01.210
I knew if he received her blood

21:01.210 --> 21:03.750
in the womb, Jonathan would be
the ultimate weapon.

21:03.750 --> 21:05.830
A warrior under my command,

21:05.830 --> 21:08.500
with the strength of both angels

21:08.500 --> 21:09.750
and demons.

21:09.750 --> 21:12.420
Why would Lilith
agree to help you?

21:12.420 --> 21:14.210
Because in exchange,

21:14.210 --> 21:16.460
I gave her the one thing
she always wanted.

21:19.210 --> 21:20.960
The one thing
she could never have.

21:23.210 --> 21:24.790
A child.

21:37.120 --> 21:38.960
Oh, Catarina! Apologies.

21:38.960 --> 21:41.080
I'm just sending out
my instructions

21:41.080 --> 21:42.420
for the synthesis spell.

21:42.420 --> 21:44.170
I'm halfway through my Rolodex.

21:44.170 --> 21:45.500
Magnus...

21:46.790 --> 21:48.500
Oh, I know that face.

21:48.500 --> 21:49.580
What is it?

21:49.580 --> 21:51.830
Lorenzo forbade the warlocks
from participating

21:51.830 --> 21:53.580
in your spell. And he asked

21:53.580 --> 21:55.380
the High Council to do the same.

21:55.380 --> 21:56.460
Why?
He didn't say.

21:56.460 --> 21:58.460
He just threatened
to send anyone who disobeys

21:58.460 --> 22:00.500
to the dungeons
of the Spiral Labyrinth.

22:05.250 --> 22:07.210
At least I can count on you.

22:07.210 --> 22:09.790
Normally, I would
risk prison for you.

22:09.790 --> 22:11.380
It wouldn't be the first time.

22:11.380 --> 22:12.670
But I can't bear the thought

22:12.670 --> 22:14.460
of leaving Madzie alone.

22:14.460 --> 22:16.330
I'm so sorry.

22:17.750 --> 22:18.920
Don't be.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.540
Sweet Pea needs you.

22:21.710 --> 22:23.330
This is Lorenzo's fault.

22:24.580 --> 22:26.790
We both know if the warlocks
can't give you the power

22:26.790 --> 22:28.710
that you need, there's
someone else who can.

22:29.710 --> 22:30.920
No.

22:30.920 --> 22:32.420
No!

22:32.420 --> 22:34.580
His help always
comes at a price.

22:34.580 --> 22:36.120
I'm not that desperate.

22:36.120 --> 22:37.540
So what are you going to do?

22:37.540 --> 22:38.620
I'm going to talk some sense

22:38.620 --> 22:40.420
into the High Warlock
of Brooklyn.

22:41.750 --> 22:43.880
This is an emergency. I need to
speak with Isabelle Lightwood.

22:43.880 --> 22:44.880
Isabelle!

22:44.880 --> 22:46.620
I'm Simon's Praetor, Jordan.

22:46.620 --> 22:48.170
I need to speak with you.

22:49.620 --> 22:50.380
It's OK.

22:51.790 --> 22:53.540
So, do you remember
that vampire Heidi?

22:53.540 --> 22:56.290
The charming blonde who attacked
me at the Hunter's Moon?

22:56.290 --> 22:58.210
She escaped from the Praetor
Lupus last night.

23:00.420 --> 23:01.500
How could you let that happen?

23:01.500 --> 23:03.460
I didn't let this happen!
She was being escorted

23:03.460 --> 23:04.880
by three Praetors when somehow

23:04.880 --> 23:06.620
she broke free and...

23:06.620 --> 23:07.880
She killed them all.

23:09.420 --> 23:10.750
I think she has Simon.

23:10.750 --> 23:12.670
I left home to grab
some blood for him,

23:12.670 --> 23:13.580
and when I got back,

23:13.580 --> 23:15.620
there was broken glass
everywhere and no Simon.

23:15.620 --> 23:16.790
Are you kidding me?!

23:16.790 --> 23:18.210
You're supposed to protect him!

23:18.210 --> 23:20.580
Look, I just really
want to find him.

23:20.580 --> 23:22.580
OK, I can't find his scent
anywhere around town.

23:22.580 --> 23:24.170
His phone's off.

23:24.170 --> 23:26.500
And I was thinking
maybe you could use

23:26.500 --> 23:27.670
Shadowhunter tracking.

23:31.580 --> 23:32.960
They deserve to know the truth.

23:32.960 --> 23:34.460
I'm trying to help you.

23:34.460 --> 23:36.210
You're living half of a life.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.750
Your friends and family
don't know the real you,

23:39.750 --> 23:42.080
what's in your heart, but I do.

23:42.080 --> 23:44.170
And you could live
an honest life with me,

23:44.170 --> 23:46.540
but then you hide
your true nature for them.

23:47.710 --> 23:49.120
Why?

23:49.120 --> 23:51.580
Just trust me. They wouldn't
believe me if I told them.

23:52.580 --> 23:56.620
Oh, but you're not
giving these smart women

23:56.620 --> 23:58.250
enough credit.

23:58.250 --> 23:59.620
Hey...

24:00.620 --> 24:02.580
So, I've got some big news.

24:03.710 --> 24:04.620
Don't do this.

24:04.620 --> 24:07.330
Simon is a vampire.

24:09.710 --> 24:10.960
What do you think about that?

24:12.670 --> 24:13.620
Simon,

24:13.620 --> 24:15.120
who is this woman?!

24:16.120 --> 24:17.540
She's a vampire.

24:17.540 --> 24:19.710
Just like me.

24:19.710 --> 24:21.330
No! She's a freaking lunatic.

24:23.080 --> 24:25.040
OH, MY GOD! NO!

24:25.040 --> 24:26.620
Don't be rude.

24:28.540 --> 24:31.040
Heidi. That's your name,
right

24:31.040 --> 24:33.080
Look at me. Look.

24:33.080 --> 24:34.790
You just committed
a second degree assault,

24:34.790 --> 24:37.120
all right, and that's a class D
felony in New York state.

24:37.120 --> 24:40.040
That means a sentence
of up to 25 years.

24:40.040 --> 24:42.000
But look. Hey, hey. Look at me.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.830
Now, I could to talk to the DA,

24:43.830 --> 24:46.040
but I can only
do that if you let me

24:46.040 --> 24:49.120
and my children go right now.

24:50.750 --> 24:52.420
A lawyer.

24:52.420 --> 24:53.710
I respect that.

24:53.710 --> 24:55.580
You need evidence

24:55.580 --> 24:57.290
to believe something.

24:57.290 --> 24:59.120
No!
Stop!

24:59.120 --> 25:00.830
No! No, no, no, no, no!

25:00.830 --> 25:02.460
No, don't! Please don't!
No, don't!

25:02.460 --> 25:03.620
Ah!

25:03.620 --> 25:04.710
ELAINE: Oh, God!

25:07.330 --> 25:08.750
ELAINE: What's going on?!

25:08.750 --> 25:10.750
Rebecca, are you OK?

25:10.750 --> 25:12.580
SIMON!

25:15.710 --> 25:17.920
HEIDI: Any vampire will feed
if they're hungry enough.

25:17.920 --> 25:20.540
And your son is starving.

25:23.670 --> 25:26.040
Lilith is in this realm
because of Jonathan?

25:26.040 --> 25:28.000
The timing can't be
a coincidence.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.540
She wants to reunite
with her son.

25:32.330 --> 25:33.790
Jonathan is dead.

25:33.790 --> 25:35.710
He is?

25:35.710 --> 25:37.000
Jace killed him.

25:38.250 --> 25:39.670
What more could she want?

25:39.670 --> 25:41.170
Do you really think death

25:41.170 --> 25:42.920
would stop a Queen of Hell?

25:42.920 --> 25:44.290
It didn't stop you.

25:44.290 --> 25:46.710
She's going
to resurrect Jonathan.

25:46.710 --> 25:47.790
Mm-hmm.

25:48.880 --> 25:51.000
This interrogation is over.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.500
Already? But I still have
so much more to say.

25:54.500 --> 25:56.000
If your guess is correct,

25:56.000 --> 25:57.920
and Lilith truly is
raising Jonathan,

25:57.920 --> 26:00.330
she may very well need
a part of your remains.

26:00.330 --> 26:02.080
Why else disturb your grave?

26:02.080 --> 26:04.790
Kill him. And this time,
incinerate the body.

26:09.880 --> 26:12.960
I will not go back
to dust and shadows.

26:12.960 --> 26:13.960
JIA: Kill him!

26:13.960 --> 26:15.210
BACK OFF!

26:21.920 --> 26:23.380
Step aside!

26:23.380 --> 26:26.250
Step aside or I'll break
your Consul's neck!

26:26.250 --> 26:27.250
KILL HIM!

26:31.750 --> 26:32.790
Let's try this again.

26:32.790 --> 26:33.960
I said

26:33.960 --> 26:35.080
STEP ASIDE!

26:35.080 --> 26:37.580
You are my ticket out of here.

26:37.580 --> 26:39.920
It'll never work. You'd need
an army to escape!

26:39.920 --> 26:40.880
An army?

26:40.880 --> 26:42.500
All I need is Clarissa.

26:42.500 --> 26:43.920
Let Jia go!

26:43.920 --> 26:44.920
Come with me.

26:44.920 --> 26:46.170
Why would I do that?

26:46.170 --> 26:47.710
Because I know
what that colour means.

26:47.710 --> 26:50.000
You'd rather burn to death
than escape with your father?

26:50.000 --> 26:51.580
Yes.

26:51.580 --> 26:52.880
What about your friends
in New York?

26:52.880 --> 26:54.620
They need your help!
You can't give up.

26:54.620 --> 26:57.250
You're a survivor, just like me.

26:57.250 --> 26:59.170
I am nothing like you.

27:19.830 --> 27:20.670
Ah!

27:36.500 --> 27:39.170
Well... it appears
I can't be killed.

27:40.460 --> 27:42.670
That's some rune, Clarissa.

28:05.170 --> 28:06.540
See you, man.

28:08.920 --> 28:11.670
I always knew you were
a snake in the grass.

28:14.540 --> 28:15.920
You lied to Alec.

28:15.920 --> 28:17.290
Now, don't be catty, Magnus.

28:17.290 --> 28:19.830
You asked me to speak
with my people. And I did.

28:19.830 --> 28:21.000
You threatened them.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.960
I strongly advised them to stay
far away from your vendetta.

28:23.960 --> 28:25.080
Vendetta?

28:25.080 --> 28:26.790
A Queen of Hell is loose.

28:26.790 --> 28:28.790
We're trying to save lives.

28:28.790 --> 28:30.620
Please.

28:30.620 --> 28:32.830
You're trying
to save Jace Herondale.

28:34.080 --> 28:35.920
I know Alec's parabatai

28:35.920 --> 28:38.080
is the one
under Lilith's thrall.

28:38.080 --> 28:40.040
Unlike you, I don't
let Lightwood charms

28:40.040 --> 28:41.210
affect my judgment.

28:43.920 --> 28:45.170
It's true.

28:45.170 --> 28:47.210
Alec has a personal stake
in this fight.

28:47.210 --> 28:49.830
If Jace dies,
part of Alec dies too.

28:49.830 --> 28:51.290
That's not my problem.

28:51.290 --> 28:53.670
But Lilith is.
She poses a threat

28:53.670 --> 28:55.420
to this entire city.
As High Warlock,

28:55.420 --> 28:56.620
you have an obligation
to consider

28:56.620 --> 28:58.000
the Shadow World's
best interests.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.500
I don't need your advice.

28:59.500 --> 29:01.710
I took this position
because you couldn't handle it.

29:01.710 --> 29:03.750
You let your heart
dictate your actions,

29:03.750 --> 29:05.210
and that will be your downfall.

29:05.210 --> 29:07.460
I'm not giving you an ounce
of power, Magnus.

29:07.460 --> 29:09.750
I don't care if you have
to watch the man you love

29:09.750 --> 29:11.620
wither and die.

29:26.830 --> 29:28.330
Attacking one's superior

29:28.330 --> 29:30.670
is grounds for banishment.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
The only thing superior
about you is your ego.

29:56.250 --> 29:58.460
You're done, Bane.

29:58.460 --> 30:00.120
You're done!

30:09.210 --> 30:10.500
I would never feed on my mom

30:10.500 --> 30:12.380
or Becky or anyone else,
for that matter.

30:12.380 --> 30:14.210
It's the only way
they'll believe us.

30:17.290 --> 30:19.120
Just a little taste...

30:19.120 --> 30:20.670
Please, don't hurt him!

30:20.670 --> 30:22.250
- Don't touch him!

30:22.250 --> 30:23.880
You're gonna make me feed
on my family, and then what?

30:23.880 --> 30:26.960
And then we'll be free
to start a new life together.

30:28.500 --> 30:30.040
What makes you think
I'd even want to do that?

30:30.040 --> 30:32.540
Hmm? I didn't even
want to turn you.

30:32.540 --> 30:34.670
We have eternity,
so you'll grow to love me

30:34.670 --> 30:36.000
the way that I love you.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.040
You're obsessed with me.

30:37.040 --> 30:39.420
There's a difference.
You just can't see it

30:39.420 --> 30:40.790
because you've never been loved.

30:40.790 --> 30:42.960
That's not true.
You've told me as much.

30:42.960 --> 30:45.040
Why else spend
your weekends and nights

30:45.040 --> 30:47.120
getting high at bleeder dens?
It's because you needed

30:47.120 --> 30:50.290
an escape from your pathetic,
miserable, lonely life.

30:50.290 --> 30:51.790
Shut up.

30:51.790 --> 30:54.290
And when you met me, you saw me
as just another escape.

30:54.290 --> 30:56.080
The nice boy who's
finally gonna love you

30:56.080 --> 30:57.500
like you think you deserve.

30:57.500 --> 30:59.290
You don't deserve my love.
You're nothing to me.

30:59.290 --> 31:00.500
You're just trash!

31:02.040 --> 31:03.750
Do it.

31:03.750 --> 31:05.000
Please, do it. Do it.

31:09.380 --> 31:12.000
You almost had me,
but she warned me

31:12.000 --> 31:13.420
about your little Mark.

31:13.420 --> 31:15.500
Who

31:15.500 --> 31:18.500
So I can't harm you directly.

31:18.500 --> 31:20.580
I just have to get creative.

31:20.580 --> 31:22.040
No! Please, please!

31:22.040 --> 31:24.000
Listen, Heidi! Heidi, take me.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.500
Please! Please don't hurt her!

31:25.500 --> 31:26.880
I won't hurt her.

31:28.460 --> 31:29.620
Go to your brother.

31:29.620 --> 31:30.750
Don't! No! Don't!
Don't! Don't! Don't!

31:30.750 --> 31:31.880
Please!

31:33.710 --> 31:34.830
Go.

31:36.750 --> 31:38.040
No! Stop! Stay! Stay! Stay!

31:39.040 --> 31:40.330
Simon?

31:43.080 --> 31:44.710
Simon, are you OK?

31:44.710 --> 31:46.670
Stay!

31:46.670 --> 31:48.000
Simon!

31:49.250 --> 31:50.420
It's me.

31:51.460 --> 31:52.670
Becky.

32:10.210 --> 32:11.170
NO!

32:11.170 --> 32:12.500
NO, SIMON!

32:15.580 --> 32:16.580
STOP!

32:19.000 --> 32:20.540
Stop!

32:20.540 --> 32:23.710
BECKY! SIMON, PLEASE STOP!

32:27.330 --> 32:28.580
IZZY: Simon?

32:28.580 --> 32:30.670
You have to stop!

32:30.670 --> 32:32.080
Simon!

32:32.080 --> 32:33.040
SIMON!

32:38.920 --> 32:40.120
Give her to me.

32:46.830 --> 32:48.120
She's still breathing.

32:48.120 --> 32:49.120
Thank the Angel.

32:49.120 --> 32:50.120
She's going to be OK, ma'am.

32:53.620 --> 32:54.790
You get away from her!

32:54.790 --> 32:55.880
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

32:55.880 --> 32:57.040
- Don't you touch her!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

32:57.040 --> 33:00.250
You hurt her again and it will
be the last thing you ever do,

33:00.250 --> 33:01.420
I swear to God!

33:01.420 --> 33:03.120
You stay away from her!

33:03.120 --> 33:04.920
You stay away from this family!

33:04.920 --> 33:07.170
I swear to God, I will kill you!

33:08.620 --> 33:09.620
Mom...

33:09.620 --> 33:11.080
YOU ARE NOT MY SON!

33:12.880 --> 33:15.080
You're a monster.

33:15.080 --> 33:16.080
GET OUT!

33:18.330 --> 33:19.540
GET OUT!

33:25.170 --> 33:27.080
You've reached the voicemail
of Magnus Bane.

33:27.080 --> 33:29.290
Please don't leave
a message at the tone.

33:29.290 --> 33:31.920
I'm centuries old
and even I think it's outdated.

33:32.920 --> 33:34.290
I'm at your place.

33:34.290 --> 33:35.290
I need a portal.

33:35.290 --> 33:36.380
Get home as soon as you can.

33:36.380 --> 33:37.290
It's an emergency.

33:52.620 --> 33:54.040
Detective Garroway.

33:57.750 --> 33:59.120
Oh. Mendez, Greer.

34:00.380 --> 34:01.620
How's your night?

34:01.620 --> 34:03.250
Better, now that we've
found you.

34:03.250 --> 34:04.830
You haven't been
answering your radio.

34:04.830 --> 34:06.330
Yeah, I...

34:06.330 --> 34:07.920
I've had some family issues.

34:07.920 --> 34:09.250
You know how it goes.

34:09.250 --> 34:11.040
Family issues?
That's interesting.

34:11.040 --> 34:12.540
You said the same thing
about your partner

34:12.540 --> 34:14.620
Olivia Wilson after
her mother was killed.

34:14.620 --> 34:16.120
And now she's MIA.

34:18.420 --> 34:19.670
Going out of town, Luke?

34:19.670 --> 34:21.170
Oh, this?

34:22.120 --> 34:23.960
I'm just returning
some equipment to a friend.

34:23.960 --> 34:25.500
Let me go drop
this off upstairs,

34:25.500 --> 34:27.460
and then I'll come back down and
we can finish our discussion.

34:29.250 --> 34:30.620
Afraid not.

34:30.620 --> 34:31.670
You need to come with us.

34:31.670 --> 34:33.290
Lieutenant wants a word.

34:55.210 --> 34:56.080
Oh, God!

34:56.080 --> 34:57.290
Halt!

35:00.920 --> 35:02.040
MAN: Don't move!

35:02.040 --> 35:03.040
WOMAN: Over there!

35:25.500 --> 35:26.830
Loyal Circle members.

35:26.830 --> 35:28.250
You are here

35:28.250 --> 35:30.290
because you were
ready to die for me.

35:30.290 --> 35:32.170
But I have come back!

35:43.500 --> 35:45.500
We'll fight our way out of here!

35:45.500 --> 35:47.250
By this sign,

35:47.250 --> 35:49.250
WE CONQUER!

36:07.290 --> 36:09.040
You OK?

36:09.040 --> 36:10.750
It's been a day.

36:10.750 --> 36:12.170
Yeah.

36:12.170 --> 36:14.960
We have no leads
on Lilith or Jace,

36:14.960 --> 36:17.000
no word on Clary.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.540
Is something burning?

36:19.920 --> 36:21.290
It's me.

36:21.290 --> 36:22.620
Things got a little bit heated

36:22.620 --> 36:24.460
during my talk with Lorenzo.

36:25.960 --> 36:28.290
I'm afraid the warlocks
are not an option.

36:32.380 --> 36:34.500
So that's it.

36:34.500 --> 36:37.250
Jace is trapped
in his own personal hell,

36:37.250 --> 36:38.920
and I can't get him out.

36:41.380 --> 36:42.830
He asked me to kill him,

36:42.830 --> 36:44.420
and I was too selfish to listen.

36:44.420 --> 36:46.210
Oh, Alexander, stop.

36:52.960 --> 36:54.290
I have to kill Jace.

36:55.790 --> 36:57.830
And I'll be damned if I let
anybody else do it.

37:00.460 --> 37:01.620
There's still a way
for me to obtain

37:01.620 --> 37:02.830
enough power to cure him.

37:05.080 --> 37:07.250
What

37:08.420 --> 37:09.670
My father.

37:10.670 --> 37:12.290
Asmodeus.

37:17.790 --> 37:19.750
I can't imagine
what you're going through.

37:19.750 --> 37:21.710
After what Heidi did...

37:21.710 --> 37:22.790
What I did.

37:22.790 --> 37:24.250
This isn't your fault!

37:24.250 --> 37:26.330
Heidi manipulated
and tortured you.

37:26.330 --> 37:28.170
But I'm the one who fed
on my own sister.

37:28.170 --> 37:29.500
Becky will be OK.

37:29.500 --> 37:31.250
She just needs a transfusion.

37:35.580 --> 37:37.000
I tried to live a normal life.

37:39.420 --> 37:41.750
But there's nothing normal
about me anymore.

37:41.750 --> 37:43.670
The way my mom looked at me...

37:43.670 --> 37:44.920
She was right.

37:47.750 --> 37:49.040
I'm a monster.

37:49.040 --> 37:50.460
No, you're not.

37:52.170 --> 37:54.250
You're a good man, Simon Lewis.

37:56.580 --> 37:58.420
And we're gonna
get through this.

37:58.420 --> 37:59.420
Together.

38:25.920 --> 38:26.920
COME ON!

38:33.750 --> 38:35.420
OPEN!

38:35.420 --> 38:37.210
That'll never work.

38:38.380 --> 38:39.580
Just stay back, Clarissa.

38:39.580 --> 38:41.500
You are not going to stop me!

38:41.500 --> 38:43.500
OPEN!

38:43.500 --> 38:44.380
No, I won't.

38:45.620 --> 38:47.170
I'm coming with you.

38:47.170 --> 38:50.210
Oh, I'm afraid
that offer has expired.

38:50.210 --> 38:51.880
I was protecting the Consul.

38:51.880 --> 38:53.170
But now...

38:53.170 --> 38:54.830
I have to protect my friends.

38:55.580 --> 38:57.380
They need to know about
Jonathan's resurrection.

39:00.500 --> 39:02.420
If that means escaping with you,

39:02.420 --> 39:04.500
then so be it.

39:06.580 --> 39:07.750
All right.

39:07.750 --> 39:09.620
Open the door.

39:31.540 --> 39:32.670
Yes...

39:43.670 --> 39:44.540
No...

39:47.960 --> 39:49.290
This time,

39:49.290 --> 39:51.120
you're not coming back.

39:54.580 --> 39:56.170
But you will never

39:56.170 --> 39:57.380
be rid of me.

40:00.960 --> 40:02.710
You...

40:02.710 --> 40:04.540
are a Morgenstern.

40:08.250 --> 40:09.420
Yes.

40:10.880 --> 40:12.080
I am.

40:13.620 --> 40:15.830
But I'm also a Fairchild.

40:20.210 --> 40:21.880
FREEZE!

40:34.540 --> 40:35.540
Please...

40:35.540 --> 40:38.330
Please, you have to destroy
Valentine's body.

41:01.710 --> 41:03.080
What are you doing?!

41:16.500 --> 41:18.580
My Queen needs
Valentine's flesh.

41:21.540 --> 41:23.040
And your heart.

41:24.460 --> 41:25.460
Get up!
