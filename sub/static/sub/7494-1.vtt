00:27.128 --> 00:27.861
People!

00:27.895 --> 00:29.097
You're in my shot.

00:29.130 --> 00:31.099
I know it's the
first day of school,

00:31.132 --> 00:33.434
but can we clear this
hallway please?

00:33.467 --> 00:35.836
Hello?

00:35.869 --> 00:36.270
Watch it.

00:36.304 --> 00:37.738
Coming through.

00:43.777 --> 00:45.546
Perfect.

00:45.579 --> 00:46.714
Hello!

00:56.890 --> 00:57.925
Excuse me.

00:57.958 --> 01:01.462
You, you with the
unnatural red hair.

01:01.495 --> 01:03.131
You are?

01:03.164 --> 01:04.465
Jodi Mappa.

01:04.498 --> 01:05.433
Freshman.

01:05.466 --> 01:06.500
By way of Red
Hook Brooklyn.

01:06.534 --> 01:07.835
What up?

01:07.868 --> 01:09.570
Ms. Diona,
principal.

01:09.603 --> 01:10.571
McKendrick
Prep.

01:10.604 --> 01:13.507
"What up" is we have a
dress code here and you,

01:13.541 --> 01:15.443
young lady have
gone far beyond it.

01:15.476 --> 01:16.710
Really?

01:16.744 --> 01:17.578
Yes.

01:17.611 --> 01:19.847
That is so sick.

01:19.880 --> 01:20.881
Thank you.

01:20.914 --> 01:21.915
Bye.

01:25.753 --> 01:29.190
School assembly
at 3pm!

01:29.223 --> 01:31.725
Attendance is

01:31.759 --> 01:41.735

01:41.769 --> 01:50.811
*

01:50.844 --> 01:52.513
3, 2, 1!

01:52.546 --> 01:54.182
The drop, yeah!

01:54.215 --> 01:58.519
*

01:58.552 --> 02:02.190
Mr. Davis.

02:02.223 --> 02:03.224
Oh.

02:03.257 --> 02:04.625
Hello!

02:04.658 --> 02:06.560
Caleb Davis?

02:06.594 --> 02:09.630
I'm Mr. Stark, the
floor's resident advisor.

02:09.663 --> 02:11.064
Are you my
problem?

02:11.098 --> 02:12.533
Sir?

02:12.566 --> 02:16.069
Every year I have a
freshman who's a problem.

02:16.103 --> 02:18.105
I don't like
problems.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.641
Sir, you're our
resident advisor.

02:20.674 --> 02:23.244
Aren't we supposed to come
to you with our problems?

02:27.548 --> 02:29.817
So it begins,
Mr. Davis.

02:29.850 --> 02:32.220
So it begins.

02:47.100 --> 02:48.135
Woo!

02:49.303 --> 02:50.137
No.

02:52.139 --> 02:53.241
Uh uh.

02:53.707 --> 02:54.542

02:54.575 --> 02:55.175

03:03.251 --> 03:06.787

03:06.820 --> 03:07.755

03:07.788 --> 03:09.657
I call it: Jodi
street couture.

03:09.690 --> 03:10.324
Shut up!

03:10.358 --> 03:11.792
Get out of my world!

03:11.825 --> 03:14.228
Talk to me.

03:14.262 --> 03:15.195
You don't mind.

03:15.229 --> 03:17.298
I record everything
for the Sun-Hi nation.

03:17.331 --> 03:18.699
I'm Sun-Hi,
b-t-dubs

03:18.732 --> 03:20.100
I'm Jodi.

03:20.133 --> 03:21.101
What's the
Sun-Hi Nation?

03:21.134 --> 03:22.135
My fans.

03:22.169 --> 03:23.671
I have 72.

03:23.704 --> 03:26.240
Mostly relatives, but
the nation is growing.

03:26.274 --> 03:27.575
You have fans?

03:27.608 --> 03:28.609
What do you do?

03:28.642 --> 03:29.443
Everything.

03:29.477 --> 03:34.582
I sing, I dance,
make people jealous.

03:34.615 --> 03:35.249
Nobody move.

03:35.283 --> 03:36.149
Ah!

03:39.320 --> 03:42.590

03:42.623 --> 03:46.226

Make it pop *

04:10.818 --> 04:12.853
Don't worry,
I got this.

04:12.886 --> 04:14.288
Whatever you're
looking for--

04:14.322 --> 04:15.856
You'll never
find it!

04:15.889 --> 04:17.257
Don't worry, I
got your back.

04:17.291 --> 04:18.726
I'm not hiding
anything.

04:18.759 --> 04:19.727
Exactly.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.663
We're completely
innocent.

04:22.696 --> 04:23.664
Relax, ladies.

04:23.697 --> 04:25.232
It's just a standard
room check.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.301
Oh, they do this in
every dorm room?

04:27.335 --> 04:29.136
Just the ones with
the special students.

04:29.169 --> 04:33.173
O-M-G this is because
of Sun-Hi Nation?

04:33.206 --> 04:34.207
Hastag blushing.

04:34.241 --> 04:35.443
Hastag no.

04:35.476 --> 04:39.179
Hastag this is about your other
roommate who's not here yet.

04:39.212 --> 04:41.315
I don't get this
whole hashtag thing.

04:41.349 --> 04:42.182
Room clear.

04:47.087 --> 04:48.656
Our roommate
needs security?

04:48.689 --> 04:50.057
I know.

04:50.090 --> 04:51.692
She must be
super famous!

04:51.725 --> 04:53.260
Or bonkers.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.096
That would def make us the
coolest dorm room in school.

04:56.129 --> 04:59.299
*

04:59.333 --> 05:00.668
Animal shelter?

05:00.701 --> 05:02.336
No, allergic to fur.

05:02.370 --> 05:03.771
Florist!

05:03.804 --> 05:06.306
No, allergic
to pollen.

05:06.340 --> 05:07.441
Babysitter?

05:07.475 --> 05:09.777
No, allergic
to babies.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.780
Job hunting
little freshman?

05:12.813 --> 05:16.216
Um, I'm talking
to you.

05:16.249 --> 05:17.150
Oh.

05:17.184 --> 05:18.352
Sorry.

05:18.386 --> 05:21.455
I'm not really used to the whole
girls talking to me thing.

05:21.489 --> 05:23.223
Yeah, I'm looking
for a job.

05:23.256 --> 05:25.225
Well, there's one
at the roller rink.

05:25.258 --> 05:27.160
It's super cool.

05:27.194 --> 05:30.197
And when Valerie says
something is super cool,

05:30.230 --> 05:32.299
most people can't
even handle it.

05:32.332 --> 05:35.068
That means
it's too cool.

05:35.102 --> 05:35.703
Wow!

05:35.736 --> 05:37.237
Thanks!

05:37.270 --> 05:38.839
No problem.

05:44.378 --> 05:48.315
Jared Anderson,
student body president.

05:51.819 --> 05:55.222
This is our year.

05:55.255 --> 05:56.824
Bye freshman.

06:02.863 --> 06:05.365
I really need to learn
how to walk like that.

06:06.834 --> 06:10.303
Mr. Stark: Attention, assembly
now in the auditorium.

06:12.272 --> 06:14.274
Ms. Diona: You
are students of

06:14.307 --> 06:15.776
McKendrick Preparatory
high school.

06:15.809 --> 06:18.311
Where we have a
history of excellence.

06:18.345 --> 06:19.480
Go McKendrick Prep!

06:19.513 --> 06:20.347
Woo!

06:20.380 --> 06:21.348
Yeah!

06:21.381 --> 06:22.850
Awesome cheer,
Valerie.

06:26.286 --> 06:30.390
And now, a word from the head
of performing arts department.

06:30.424 --> 06:31.759
Mr. Stark.

06:36.430 --> 06:39.166
Theatre.

06:39.199 --> 06:43.170
It mirrors the essence
of who we are.

06:43.203 --> 06:48.241
Makes the struggles, failures,
and rejections of this life--

06:58.051 --> 07:00.554
In a couple of weeks, I'll be
announcing the school musical.

07:00.588 --> 07:02.322
Everyone is encouraged
to participate.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.294
Great announcement
to inform us about

07:07.327 --> 07:08.496
a future announcement,
Mr. Stark.

07:10.063 --> 07:10.631
School musical?

07:10.664 --> 07:12.199
I could be
the lead.

07:12.232 --> 07:14.201
We don't even know
what show it is.

07:14.234 --> 07:15.135
It doesn't matter.

07:15.168 --> 07:17.137
You stand under a
spotlight for two hours,

07:17.170 --> 07:18.539
then everyone
applauds for you.

07:18.572 --> 07:21.274
It's what I was
born to do.

07:21.308 --> 07:23.276
*

07:23.310 --> 07:26.413
* So, this is
how it starts. *

07:26.446 --> 07:28.448
* From the high
to the low. *

07:28.482 --> 07:30.551
* Future fans and
it's my show. *

07:30.584 --> 07:34.087
* So, this is how
it feels to *

07:34.121 --> 07:38.191
* get everyone talking,
the big reveal. *

07:38.225 --> 07:41.161
*

07:41.194 --> 07:45.833
* It's a crazy situation,
it's my destination. *

07:48.502 --> 07:53.206
* Absolute fascination
all across the nation. *

07:53.240 --> 07:58.211
* Now, I'm here where
I'm meant to be *

07:58.245 --> 08:00.147
* I'm meant to be

08:00.180 --> 08:05.318
* Show of the year,
the new drama queen, *

08:05.352 --> 08:07.588
* Boom boom, on
the scene. *

08:07.621 --> 08:12.425
* Now, I'm here, where
I'm meant to be *

08:12.459 --> 08:15.062
* I'm meant to be

08:15.095 --> 08:20.100
* Show of the year,
the new drama queen, *

08:20.133 --> 08:22.235
* Boom boom, on
the scene. *

08:22.269 --> 08:29.610
*

08:29.643 --> 08:35.148
* So, this is it my friends, the
hottest ticket in town, *

08:35.182 --> 08:37.250
* Everyone will attend.

08:37.284 --> 08:40.453
* Oh, this is
where it goes, *

08:40.487 --> 08:44.324
* in the auditorium and
everyone knows. *

08:44.357 --> 08:49.362
* Now, I'm here where
I'm meant to be *

08:49.396 --> 08:51.599
* I'm meant to be

08:51.632 --> 08:57.270
* Show of the year,
the new drama queen, *

08:57.304 --> 08:59.239
* Boom boom,
on the scene. *

08:59.272 --> 09:04.144
* Now, I'm here where
I'm meant to be *

09:04.177 --> 09:06.546
* I'm meant to be

09:06.580 --> 09:11.484
* Show of the year,
the new drama queen, *

09:11.518 --> 09:14.421
* Boom boom, on
the scene. *

09:20.393 --> 09:22.229
In case you were wondering,
freshman students

09:22.262 --> 09:25.132
don't perform as leads in
the school musical.

09:25.165 --> 09:26.433
Ever.

09:28.201 --> 09:29.269
Assembly over.

09:29.302 --> 09:30.570
Good day.

09:34.307 --> 09:35.142
Sun-Hi: No freshman leads?

09:35.175 --> 09:37.377
Like I'm going to
listen to a man that

09:37.410 --> 09:40.013
has hair that looks like
an old birds nest.

09:40.047 --> 09:42.249
Everyone knows if you're
going to rock the nest,

09:42.282 --> 09:43.516
you have to
go all out.

09:43.550 --> 09:45.252
Duh!

09:45.285 --> 09:51.258
*

09:51.291 --> 09:52.159
You like my sound?

09:52.192 --> 09:54.161
Your beats are sick.

09:54.194 --> 09:56.263
Wait, not sick like my
Nana's old cat Maurice.

09:56.296 --> 09:58.198
No, the good sick.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.301
Caleb Davis.

10:01.334 --> 10:02.202
I'm Sun-Hi.

10:02.235 --> 10:04.004
This is Jodi.

10:04.037 --> 10:05.238
There she is!

10:05.272 --> 10:07.174
Our mystery
roommate!

10:07.207 --> 10:08.141
Gotta go!

10:08.175 --> 10:09.442
Got anymore of
that good music?

10:09.476 --> 10:10.577
I've got plenty!

10:11.444 --> 10:13.313
Talking to girls
isn't so hard.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.082
Keeping them
around, another story.

10:19.152 --> 10:21.154
What kind of person
has a security detail?

10:21.188 --> 10:23.456
Maybe she's an
undercover agent.

10:23.490 --> 10:25.425
Or a spy!

10:25.458 --> 10:27.427
Or an actor.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.229
(Knock on the door)

10:31.598 --> 10:33.200
Delivery, ladies.

10:33.233 --> 10:34.301
Watch out.

10:36.469 --> 10:37.437
(bang)

10:39.239 --> 10:40.240
What is it?

10:40.273 --> 10:41.208
I don't know.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.176
The less I know, the
less problems I have.

10:43.210 --> 10:43.777
But--

10:43.811 --> 10:46.013
I don't want to know.

10:50.283 --> 10:51.351
What are you doing?

10:51.551 --> 10:53.220
It's our room.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.422
We get to see what
gets delivered to it.

10:58.258 --> 11:00.060
You know what this
means, don't you?

11:00.093 --> 11:02.495
You've committed a felony by
opening up someone else's mail?

11:02.529 --> 11:06.499
No, our roommate
is a spy!

11:08.201 --> 11:10.603
And we have to find
out who she really is.

11:13.140 --> 11:23.116
*

11:23.150 --> 11:30.223
*

11:30.257 --> 11:32.325
I just want to know
every intimate detail

11:32.359 --> 11:34.361
about our new roommate
before she moves in.

11:34.394 --> 11:36.329
Is that so
unreasonable?

11:36.363 --> 11:38.365
Sort of, but
I like it.

11:38.398 --> 11:41.101
*

11:41.134 --> 11:41.769
Sun-Hi: Late admission.

11:41.802 --> 11:43.136
That has to be her.

11:45.839 --> 11:46.206
Someone's coming.

11:46.239 --> 11:47.274
We gotta go.

11:47.307 --> 11:48.275
Both: Woah!

11:52.880 --> 11:54.514
What are we
gonna do?

11:54.547 --> 11:55.816
In here.

12:02.255 --> 12:03.223
Sun-Hi:
Shh! Quiet!

12:03.256 --> 12:05.158
Here they come.

12:05.192 --> 12:07.094
Security, late
registration.

12:07.127 --> 12:09.797
Do you really think one student
is worth all this trouble?

12:09.830 --> 12:11.264
This one is.

12:11.298 --> 12:14.101
Why must they all
leave these open?

12:14.134 --> 12:16.269
I mean, really.

12:16.303 --> 12:18.505
It's the first day.

12:18.538 --> 12:20.140
These kids.

12:20.173 --> 12:21.374
Would you mind?

12:21.408 --> 12:22.810
Would I?

12:22.843 --> 12:23.844
No.

12:30.150 --> 12:31.151
(chuckles)

12:32.853 --> 12:34.487
Jodi: What are we
going to do?

12:34.521 --> 12:37.124
This might not be a
good time to tell you,

12:37.157 --> 12:39.159
but I don't do well
in tight spaces.

12:39.192 --> 12:40.360
Really?

12:40.393 --> 12:42.262
I thought everyone enjoyed
being locked in a tight space

12:42.295 --> 12:46.566
that smells like
rotten egg sandwich.

12:46.599 --> 12:49.837
I think it just
touched my ankle.

12:49.870 --> 12:52.205
Ew!

12:52.239 --> 12:53.573
Don't let it
touch me!

12:56.176 --> 12:59.847
(snoring)

12:59.880 --> 13:00.447
Wake up!

13:00.480 --> 13:01.882
Uh?

13:01.915 --> 13:08.188
You were snoring and
using my face as a pillow.

13:08.221 --> 13:09.422
We're still in here?

13:09.456 --> 13:11.191
Yup.

13:11.224 --> 13:13.861
I just posted another
call for help.

13:13.894 --> 13:16.229
Help I have gout.

13:16.263 --> 13:17.430
Autocorrect.

13:17.464 --> 13:20.300
I meant to write:
help get us out!

13:20.333 --> 13:21.869
How about mentioning
we're in a

13:21.902 --> 13:23.536
school locker or
McKendrick Prep?

13:23.570 --> 13:26.273
Anything that would help
someone actually find us.

13:26.306 --> 13:27.740
People did
find me.

13:27.774 --> 13:30.177
Over 25 responses.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.479
Apparently, your family is well
versed in remedies for gout.

13:32.512 --> 13:33.746
Oh.

13:33.780 --> 13:34.882
(school bell ringing)

13:34.915 --> 13:35.315
Hey!

13:35.348 --> 13:35.782
We're in here!

13:35.815 --> 13:38.919
(banging)

13:46.526 --> 13:47.327
Sun-Hi: What?

13:47.360 --> 13:48.862
He didn't
even see us.

13:48.896 --> 13:51.899
Jodi: Think you could
help us get out?

14:00.908 --> 14:03.410
You are in
my locker?

14:05.845 --> 14:07.214
Hello?

14:07.247 --> 14:08.882
There's still someone
stuck in here.

14:08.916 --> 14:10.250
Oh.

14:10.283 --> 14:11.218
Right.

14:11.251 --> 14:12.886
Sorry.

14:12.920 --> 14:15.188
Ow.

14:16.890 --> 14:18.325
You know what?

14:18.358 --> 14:20.994
I don't even
want to know.

14:21.028 --> 14:22.329
He's different.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.463
Yeah.

14:23.496 --> 14:24.998
In a kinda
cute way.

14:25.032 --> 14:29.369
*

14:33.907 --> 14:47.454
(phone ringing)

14:47.487 --> 14:49.822
Hello?

14:50.924 --> 14:52.960
How did you know
I wanted a job?

14:52.993 --> 14:54.962
Oh yes, the sign
would give it away.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.997
Yes, I'm looking
for a job.

14:57.030 --> 14:59.532
Preferably something
that can utilize my song

14:59.566 --> 15:01.901
writing skills and
sensitive artistic nature.

15:03.536 --> 15:06.806
Custodian?

15:06.839 --> 15:07.941
I'll take it.

15:07.975 --> 15:09.542
Thank you.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.311
Yes!

15:11.344 --> 15:21.321
*

15:21.354 --> 15:31.864
*

15:31.898 --> 15:34.301
This place has
killer sound.

15:35.868 --> 15:41.975
(beatboxing)

15:45.445 --> 15:46.746
Oh.

15:50.117 --> 15:51.985
Whoa!

15:52.019 --> 15:54.887
What is this?

15:54.921 --> 16:01.528
(phone ringing)

16:04.464 --> 16:05.999
Hello?

16:06.033 --> 16:08.968
Oh, yes sir those salt
shakers are family heirlooms,

16:09.002 --> 16:10.837
right and I will
be sure to fix

16:10.870 --> 16:13.740
that tinsy little
bit of wall damage.

16:13.773 --> 16:16.009
Don't you worry.

16:16.043 --> 16:16.876
Noted.

16:16.909 --> 16:18.111
You don't worry.

16:18.145 --> 16:20.813
I worry.

16:24.884 --> 16:28.888
Anyone who practices slow motion
walking is definitely not cute.

16:28.921 --> 16:30.723
You're unbelievable.

16:30.757 --> 16:31.758
Thank you!

16:31.791 --> 16:33.893
I enjoy your
company too.

16:33.926 --> 16:36.763
(speaking Japanese)

16:36.796 --> 16:38.531
She's here.

16:46.139 --> 16:46.939
Ahem.

16:49.809 --> 16:50.643
Hi.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.445
I'm Corkie Chang, your
new roommate.

16:52.479 --> 16:53.913
I'm Jodie.

16:53.946 --> 16:55.148
This is Sun-Hi.

16:55.182 --> 16:56.783
Are you famous?

16:56.816 --> 16:57.517
Sun-Hi.

16:57.550 --> 16:58.185
Come on!

16:58.218 --> 17:00.153
We're sisters
in dorm life.

17:00.187 --> 17:03.956
We need a circle of
trust and if she's famous...

17:03.990 --> 17:04.957
Oh.

17:06.926 --> 17:08.395
Designer.

17:09.762 --> 17:12.865
I need to know so I can
use it to my advantage.

17:12.899 --> 17:13.900
Don't mind
Sun-Hi.

17:13.933 --> 17:15.068
She's weird.

17:15.102 --> 17:20.073
Not weird, weird,
just unique weird.

17:20.807 --> 17:21.774
You play that?

17:21.808 --> 17:23.009
Since I was 4.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.477
My father
wanted me to.

17:24.511 --> 17:27.880
Well, my father wanted
me to be a boy,

17:27.914 --> 17:30.817
but I think disappointment
is good for parents.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.519
Keeps them guessing.

17:32.952 --> 17:35.021
Look, you two
seem nice but you

17:35.054 --> 17:36.856
probably won't be
seeing much of me.

17:36.889 --> 17:40.193
I'm here to study hard and get
into an American university.

17:40.227 --> 17:41.928
You're right!

17:41.961 --> 17:45.932
She's not a spy,
she's an alien.

17:49.202 --> 17:50.170
Jodi: Sun-Hi come on!

17:50.203 --> 17:52.172
I can't see.

17:52.205 --> 17:53.873
(scream)

17:55.142 --> 17:56.143
Oh. That's better.

17:56.176 --> 17:58.711
She doesn't even have
class first period.

17:58.745 --> 17:59.112
Come on!

17:59.146 --> 18:00.012
We're late.

18:00.547 --> 18:04.917
*

18:04.951 --> 18:07.187
(school bell rings)

18:07.220 --> 18:08.188
I forgot my phone.

18:08.221 --> 18:09.956
I'll be right back.

18:09.989 --> 18:11.924
(violin playing)

18:11.958 --> 18:14.927
*

18:14.961 --> 18:18.698
* Waiting some time
for the hand of fate. *

18:18.731 --> 18:22.702
* Dreaming the dream,
I can hardly wait. *

18:22.735 --> 18:26.239
* We are going to
be a part of it. *

18:26.273 --> 18:29.876
* No stopping us
now, the fire's lit. *

18:29.909 --> 18:31.944
* Blast off now,
hear the sonic boom. *

18:31.978 --> 18:34.214
* Everybody's gonna
get down in the room. *

18:34.247 --> 18:36.949
* Shoot for the stars,
we'll wave to the Moon. *

18:36.983 --> 18:39.018
* The lighting strike
goes zoom, zoom, zoom. *

18:39.051 --> 18:42.088
* We're taking over,
better step aside. *

18:42.121 --> 18:45.858
* We'll hit the road, but
we'll still need a ride. *

18:45.892 --> 18:48.728
* We're gonna get to work
on our grand design, *

18:48.761 --> 18:51.231
* tag you in a post
when we get online. *

18:51.264 --> 18:54.734
* If we have the time.

18:54.767 --> 18:58.238
* Turn up the spotlight,
we're on our way. *

18:58.271 --> 19:02.709
* Turn up the spotlight,
we want to play. *

19:02.742 --> 19:10.250
* We'll get it, I'll bet it,
we're gonna be stars one day. *

19:10.283 --> 19:14.254
* All we gotta do
is write a song. *

19:14.287 --> 19:18.225
* Then we'll get
our own emoticon. *

19:18.258 --> 19:22.128
* Everywhere we go,
they'll scream our names. *

19:22.161 --> 19:26.233
* I guess that comes
with the price of fame. *

19:26.266 --> 19:30.270
* Turn up the spotlight,
we're on our way. *

19:30.303 --> 19:34.241
* Turn up the spotlight,
we want to play. *

19:34.274 --> 19:42.282
* We'll get it, I'll bet it,
we're gonna be stars one day. *

19:42.315 --> 19:45.685
*

19:45.718 --> 19:47.287
* S-U-N hi, yeah.

19:47.320 --> 19:48.688
* It's J-O-D.

19:48.721 --> 19:49.956
* Listen up, Corki.

19:49.989 --> 19:52.759
* We'll be in the sky,
they'll see us glow *

19:52.792 --> 19:54.761
* Over the airwaves
on the radio. *

19:54.794 --> 19:57.196
* Just give us the lights,
we'll steal the show. *

19:57.230 --> 19:59.799
* Throw your hands up
then lose control. *

19:59.832 --> 20:01.868
* Work everyday and
all through the night. *

20:01.901 --> 20:04.271
* Only get one shot
better do it right. *

20:04.304 --> 20:06.839
* Won't stop till everybody
knows the name. *

20:06.873 --> 20:09.676
* They better be ready
cause we'll bring the fame. *

20:09.709 --> 20:12.011
* Turn up the spotlight,
we're on our way. *

20:12.044 --> 20:15.682
* Turn up the spotlight,
we want to play. *

20:15.715 --> 20:21.854
* We'll get it, I'll bet it,
we're gonna be stars one day. *

20:24.090 --> 20:27.827
Corkie, who knew you could
sound so great with me.

20:27.860 --> 20:30.697
I've never sung with
anyone else before.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.799
It was fun!

20:32.832 --> 20:34.200
My gift to you.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.903
You weren't recording
that, were you?

20:36.936 --> 20:37.837
Of course I was!

20:37.870 --> 20:39.939
I'm pretty always
recording everything.

20:39.972 --> 20:40.940
It's kinda my thing.

20:40.973 --> 20:42.675
You'll get used to it.

20:42.709 --> 20:43.410
No.

20:43.443 --> 20:44.944
No one else can
know about this.

20:44.977 --> 20:45.978
What are you
talking about?

20:46.012 --> 20:46.779
This is fate!

20:46.813 --> 20:48.848
Our first step in
our epic journey

20:48.881 --> 20:50.216
to starting a pop
super group!

20:50.249 --> 20:52.051
A pop super group?

20:52.084 --> 20:53.853
There's no pop group.

20:53.886 --> 20:57.089
Oh contraire,
mon frere.

20:57.123 --> 21:00.860
That means you know nothing
Jodi in some other language.

21:00.893 --> 21:03.062
French, and that's
not what it means.

21:03.095 --> 21:06.198
Please promise me you'll
never tell anyone about this?

21:06.232 --> 21:07.900
Please?

21:07.934 --> 21:13.940
Okay, but that won't do any good
cause it already went viral!

21:13.973 --> 21:14.907
What?

21:14.941 --> 21:16.175
Okay, let's just
all calm down...

21:16.208 --> 21:19.779
Corkie, if you're going to be in
a band, people have to see you.

21:19.812 --> 21:21.848
It's the whole
point of a band.

21:21.881 --> 21:23.783
You know, besides the
music and all that.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.251
You couldn't
possibly understand.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.219
No one could.

21:28.154 --> 21:30.156
What do you think
that was all about?

21:30.189 --> 21:31.658
I don't know.

21:31.691 --> 21:33.225
I thought you were gonna
be the weird roommate.
