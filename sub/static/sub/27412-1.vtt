to make new friends at school,

12:07.083 --> 12:10.541
[all chanting] Not like us!
Not like us! Not like us!

12:10.625 --> 12:12.708
- Not like us!
- Stop standing around.

12:13.041 --> 12:14.041
Freaks.

12:18.583 --> 12:19.583
[Klaus] It's a crossroads.

12:19.916 --> 12:21.458
Technically, it's more of a fork.

12:21.541 --> 12:23.916
I meant figuratively.
We have to decide which direction to go.

12:28.250 --> 12:30.083
This road leads
to the Valley of Four Drafts.

12:30.166 --> 12:32.375
That's where the map said
the headquarters were hidden.

12:32.458 --> 12:33.625
That means V.F.D. is that way.

12:36.750 --> 12:39.375
Look at this bottle. There's some
liquid in it that isn't frozen,

12:39.458 --> 12:42.500
which means it was recently thrown by
a person who doesn't care about littering.

12:42.583 --> 12:43.708
Count Olaf went this way.

12:43.791 --> 12:46.666
If we go to the headquarters, we can find
V.F.D. They can help save Sunny.

12:46.750 --> 12:49.250
We can't wait that long.
Sunny's in danger right now!

12:49.333 --> 12:51.916
If one of our parents is alive up there,
they can fix this.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.750
If one of our parents is alive,
do you want to face them without Sunny?

12:55.541 --> 12:56.458
No.

12:57.291 --> 12:58.500
I think we should go this way.

12:58.583 --> 13:00.208
I think we should go this way.

13:01.166 --> 13:02.375
[wind whistling]

13:02.458 --> 13:03.958
[buzzing]

13:04.041 --> 13:04.916
Do you hear something?

13:05.000 --> 13:06.708
-Oh, no.
-What are those?

13:06.791 --> 13:08.750
Snow gnats. I read about them
in an obscure book.

13:08.833 --> 13:11.375
-What did you read?
-They're ill-tempered and well organized.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.291
-Anything else?
-Yeah, they sting.

13:13.375 --> 13:14.458
We should go that way.

13:14.541 --> 13:16.125
-[bottle smashes]
-I agree.

13:16.791 --> 13:18.000
-Ow!
-Ow!

13:18.083 --> 13:18.916
Ow!

13:19.000 --> 13:20.625
-What stops them?
-Smoke.

13:20.708 --> 13:22.875
Smoke? How are we supposed to get smoke
out here?

13:22.958 --> 13:23.791
I don't know!

13:23.875 --> 13:24.708
Ow!

13:24.791 --> 13:25.833
[gnats buzzing]

13:25.916 --> 13:28.416
[panting]

13:29.916 --> 13:30.833
Look over there!

13:31.791 --> 13:33.791
[gnats buzzing]

13:39.250 --> 13:40.208
The snow gnats stopped.

13:40.291 --> 13:42.416
There must be something inside
that scares them.

13:43.666 --> 13:45.625
[Violet] Let's hope
it's not a hibernating animal.

13:47.125 --> 13:48.375
Oh, no.

13:50.208 --> 13:52.125
Hello, cakesniffers.

13:53.291 --> 13:55.541
It's called a catchphrase,

13:55.625 --> 13:59.083
a word which here means "a catchy phrase,"

13:59.166 --> 14:04.041
and it is one of the most important tools
in any  pre-former's  repertoire.

14:04.125 --> 14:06.166
Wow, it's really nice
that you're taking time

14:06.250 --> 14:08.041
out of your busy schedule
of plotting arson

14:08.125 --> 14:09.708
to give us an acting lesson, boss.

14:09.791 --> 14:11.083
I'm not just your boss.

14:11.166 --> 14:13.333
Please, I want you to think of me
as your mentor.

14:13.916 --> 14:16.458
Besides, I'm about to get
everything I've ever wanted in life,

14:16.541 --> 14:17.708
so I'm feeling generous.

14:17.791 --> 14:21.125
[Olaf] A catchphrase
should be cool and snappy,

14:21.208 --> 14:25.000
and you should be able to use it
in any situation at all, like, um...

14:25.750 --> 14:27.958
"It's my way or the freeway."

14:28.875 --> 14:31.500
Or, "Give me those earrings, Rachel."

14:31.875 --> 14:32.916
And...

14:33.000 --> 14:34.416
it should be rooted...

14:35.166 --> 14:36.208
in the truth,

14:36.625 --> 14:38.541
which is why, when I perform,

14:38.625 --> 14:42.000
I ignore the script
and say whatever comes into my mind.

14:42.958 --> 14:46.750
Pajama bottoms. Absinthe. Nickelback.
Let's try this right now.

14:46.833 --> 14:49.333
When I point at you, say the first thing
that pops into your head.

14:49.833 --> 14:51.500
-I'm in love with you.
-Not bad.

14:51.583 --> 14:54.125
-I'm in love with you more.
-Now, that's catchy.

14:55.125 --> 14:56.958
-I'm in love with your girlfriend.
-Eww.

14:57.041 --> 14:59.791
Is a personal philosophy
of moral relativism

14:59.875 --> 15:02.458
the only way to survive
in an ethically complex world,

15:02.541 --> 15:05.375
or is it an excuse we use
to justify doing bad things?

15:07.458 --> 15:08.583
Could use a polish.

15:08.666 --> 15:10.000
I'm in love with--

15:10.083 --> 15:11.791
Look what I found, darling!

15:11.875 --> 15:14.791
A pack of strange, green cigarettes
just lying in the snow,

15:14.875 --> 15:17.375
as if someone dropped them
whilst running for their life.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.750
Smoking is very, very bad for you.

15:19.833 --> 15:21.250
[clears throat] I was mentoring

15:21.333 --> 15:23.083
-the henchpeople, pet.
-Oh.

15:23.166 --> 15:25.041
Hooky was about to tell me
his catchphrase.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.625
-Hey, the baby's gone.
-That's a terrible catchphrase.

15:27.708 --> 15:29.958
Hey, the baby's gone.

15:30.041 --> 15:31.000
What?

15:40.250 --> 15:42.125
Thought you could get away, did you?

15:42.208 --> 15:43.958
Well, you should know by now,

15:44.041 --> 15:47.541
-it's my way or the freeway.
-Roadway.

15:48.458 --> 15:51.833
Look around, you saber-toothed papoose.

15:51.916 --> 15:53.125
There's nowhere to run.

15:53.625 --> 15:55.958
You would never survive
in the mountains by yourself.

15:56.500 --> 16:00.208
You've always had your irritating siblings
to look after you.

16:00.458 --> 16:02.416
Well, not anymore.

16:02.833 --> 16:05.250
So if you want to survive,

16:05.583 --> 16:08.958
I'd be a little less irritating.

16:09.958 --> 16:12.458
-Like that girl from Prufrock Prep.
-What girl?

16:13.208 --> 16:14.916
Oh, it was before your time, dearest.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.333
I don't care. I'll scratch her eyes out.

16:17.416 --> 16:19.375
What? It was a little girl.

16:19.458 --> 16:24.333
Short, adorable, with the pretty brooch
and the brass knuckles.

16:24.416 --> 16:25.416
What was her name again?

16:25.500 --> 16:26.916
Carmelita Spats.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.958
Go away, cakesniffers!
This is a private cave!

16:31.000 --> 16:33.666
Carmelita, who are you talking to?

16:33.750 --> 16:36.708
They're in our cave,
so obviously they're cakesniffers.

16:37.541 --> 16:38.500
Wait.

16:39.416 --> 16:41.625
You're those orphans from Prufrock Prep

16:41.708 --> 16:44.166
who lost your home in a fire
and then Vice Princie expelled you.

16:44.250 --> 16:46.458
-We've never been to Prufrock Prep.
-He did not expel us.

16:46.541 --> 16:49.625
-I knew it. You're the Baudelaires!
-[woman gasps] I hope not!

16:49.708 --> 16:52.500
I read about those terrible children
in  The Daily Punctilio.

16:52.583 --> 16:54.750
It said they are murderers and arsonists.

16:54.833 --> 16:58.083
They started that enormous fire that's
still raging across the hinterlands.

16:58.583 --> 17:01.166
-Well, we're not them. We're...
-Mountain climbers.

17:01.250 --> 17:03.375
...mountain climbers.
We're looking for our sister.

17:03.458 --> 17:05.625
She's about this tall,
she has a good set of teeth,

17:05.708 --> 17:08.125
and she's traveling with a bunch
of dangerous-looking people.

17:08.208 --> 17:09.166
Have you seen her?

17:09.250 --> 17:11.791
We haven't seen anyone. We've been
in this cave hiding from gnats,

17:11.875 --> 17:14.833
but we have a map of the mountains
you can consult.

17:14.916 --> 17:16.708
No! No!

17:16.791 --> 17:18.208
[Carmelita] Scoutmaster Brucie,

17:18.291 --> 17:20.083
this cave is for Snow Scouts only,

17:20.166 --> 17:23.041
and they're obviously the Baudelaires!
Look at their little orphan faces!

17:23.125 --> 17:24.416
Now, Carmelita.

17:24.500 --> 17:28.083
Snow Scouts should be accommodating.
It's the first word of our pledge.

17:28.166 --> 17:29.041
You're Snow Scouts?

17:29.125 --> 17:32.250
Troupe 113 is the most exclusive
Snow Scout troupe in the city.

17:32.333 --> 17:35.750
Only non-cakesniffers with rich,
living parents are allowed to join.

17:35.833 --> 17:37.458
[Carmelita] Isn't that right, Brucie?

17:37.541 --> 17:39.083
I have to carry their luggage.

17:39.166 --> 17:40.208
It's designer.

17:40.291 --> 17:42.291
You should carry your own luggage,
Carmelita,

17:42.375 --> 17:44.208
and you should join us by the fire.

17:44.291 --> 17:46.333
We have extra parkas and snow suits
if you're cold.

17:46.416 --> 17:47.958
And extra masks.

17:48.041 --> 17:49.291
Why would we want masks?

17:49.375 --> 17:51.375
If you're outside,
they keep the snow gnats away.

17:51.458 --> 17:55.625
And when you're inside,
they make a Very Furtive Disguise.

17:58.208 --> 18:02.291
It has been difficult for me
to investigate Sunny Baudelaire's time

18:02.375 --> 18:04.291
as Count Olaf's prisoner.

18:04.375 --> 18:08.500
A few witnesses have died, disappeared,
or been carried off by eagles.

18:08.583 --> 18:11.041
[man] Oh, oh, oh! Oopsie!

18:11.125 --> 18:15.375
There is a story that describes
more or less the same situation,

18:15.458 --> 18:17.833
and that is the story of Cinderella.

18:21.166 --> 18:22.916
Maybe she can give us some tips.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.958
[Lemony] Cinderella was a young person

18:25.041 --> 18:27.250
who was placed in the care
of various wicked people

18:27.333 --> 18:29.958
who teased her
and made her do all of their chores.

18:30.041 --> 18:31.458
Look at that useless baby.

18:31.541 --> 18:34.125
It doesn't even know how to get water
from a frozen pond.

18:34.208 --> 18:35.708
[scoffs] Look at her carrying a pail!

18:35.791 --> 18:37.833
[roaring laughter]

18:38.833 --> 18:43.041
She was rescued by a fairy godmother
who magically created a special outfit

18:43.125 --> 18:46.166
so Cinderella could go to a ball
and marry a prince.

18:49.125 --> 18:51.541
If you would like the story
of Sunny Baudelaire,

18:51.625 --> 18:55.291
simply take the story of Cinderella
and eliminate the fairy godmother,

18:55.625 --> 18:58.916
the special outfit, the ball,
the prince, the marriage,

18:59.000 --> 19:01.541
the seasonal gourd
that becomes a carriage,

19:01.625 --> 19:04.708
and the ending
where they live happily ever after.

19:04.791 --> 19:06.250
There you are, baby.

19:07.125 --> 19:07.958
I, uh...

19:08.958 --> 19:10.291
I made you this outfit.

19:10.916 --> 19:14.833
I know it's nothing special, but...
it's warmer than those rags.

19:14.916 --> 19:16.291
Count Olaf would be furious

19:16.375 --> 19:19.291
if you froze to death
before he could get your fortune, so...

19:20.083 --> 19:21.416
What are you doing?

19:22.625 --> 19:23.750
[sighs]

19:30.625 --> 19:31.625
You've got, uh...

19:33.083 --> 19:34.791
You've got cinders on your face.

19:36.958 --> 19:37.791
Chabo.

19:49.375 --> 19:50.666
Yay!

19:50.750 --> 19:52.000
Don't give me that look.

19:52.083 --> 19:54.041
[babbling]

19:54.125 --> 19:56.041
And then Cinderella told Prince Charming

19:56.125 --> 19:59.791
that she's got an even more beautiful
sister whose name is Carmelita,

19:59.875 --> 20:01.666
so he married her instead.

20:01.750 --> 20:04.916
And then she divorced him
and took all of his money. The end!

20:06.708 --> 20:08.208
Now, this is the story

20:08.291 --> 20:10.625
of Sleeping Beauty's
even more adorable younger sister--

20:10.708 --> 20:12.958
Carmelita, you've told
nine stories already.

20:13.041 --> 20:14.833
Maybe somebody else would like a turn.

20:15.416 --> 20:17.666
I bet mountain climbers
have interesting stories.

20:17.750 --> 20:18.583
[Carmelita] Yeah.

20:18.666 --> 20:21.625
Has anything really terrible
happened to you?

20:23.625 --> 20:24.958
We'd rather not share.

20:25.041 --> 20:27.500
You should be more accommodating.
After all...

20:27.583 --> 20:32.625
[all chant] Snow Scouts are accommodating,
basic, calm, darling, emblematic,

20:32.708 --> 20:35.958
frisky, grinning, human,
innocent, jumping,

20:36.041 --> 20:39.208
kept, limited, meek, naploving, official,

20:39.291 --> 20:41.500
pretty, quarantined, recent, scheduled,

20:41.583 --> 20:44.791
tidy, understandable,
victorious, wholesome,

20:44.875 --> 20:46.791
xylophone, young, and zippered.

20:46.875 --> 20:51.041
Every morning, every afternoon,
every night, and all day long!

20:51.125 --> 20:53.125
That... That can't
honestly be your pledge.

20:53.875 --> 20:55.500
How can anyone be "xylophone"?

20:55.833 --> 20:57.291
It's not an adjective.

20:57.375 --> 20:59.916
You can't change the words
of the Snow Scout Alphabet Pledge.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.708
The whole point of the Snow Scouts is that
we do the same thing over and over!

21:03.791 --> 21:06.375
We wear the same parkas,
we recite the same pledge,

21:06.458 --> 21:10.000
and every year, we celebrate False Spring
at the top of Mount Fraught.

21:10.333 --> 21:12.333
And we always make Brucie
carry our luggage.

21:13.916 --> 21:14.916
What's False Spring?

21:15.958 --> 21:18.666
Anybody who's not a cakesniffer
knows that False Spring

21:18.750 --> 21:22.208
is when the weather gets unusually warm
before it gets cold again.

21:22.291 --> 21:24.333
We celebrate with a dance
around a special pole,

21:24.416 --> 21:27.708
and then I get chosen False Spring Queen!

21:27.791 --> 21:29.750
-It doesn't have to be you.
-Yes, it does!

21:29.833 --> 21:33.625
Because I'm the most accommodating,
basic, calm--

21:33.708 --> 21:36.166
Are you sure you two don't have a story?

21:36.250 --> 21:39.041
I'd love to hear a Very Fascinating Drama.

21:39.416 --> 21:40.750
We know all sorts of stories.

21:40.833 --> 21:43.291
Stories about Vastly Frightening Danger.

21:43.375 --> 21:45.083
And Vain Fashionable Divas.

21:45.166 --> 21:47.500
Have you read the story of  Anna Karenina?

21:48.125 --> 21:49.375
Our mother read it to us.

21:49.458 --> 21:52.125
We were very young, so she'd stop
to explain all the words and themes.

21:52.208 --> 21:53.458
Boring!

21:53.541 --> 21:55.833
Anna Karenina  is a classic
of Russian literature!

21:55.916 --> 21:57.291
That's another word for boring,

21:57.375 --> 22:00.333
-and so are stories about dead parents.
-Carmelita has a point.

22:00.416 --> 22:04.166
Anyhow, it's late, and I feel sick
from eating so many marshmallows.

22:04.541 --> 22:06.666
So, everyone, get in your sleeping bags.

22:06.750 --> 22:08.500
You should stay the night here, travelers.

22:08.583 --> 22:10.625
We have some extra horse blankets
you can sleep on.

22:10.708 --> 22:13.083
You cakesniffers
should sleep far away from us.

22:13.166 --> 22:15.166
Those blankets smell like nail polish.

22:15.250 --> 22:18.000
That's because you spilled nail polish
all over them.

22:20.458 --> 22:22.375
[wind howling]

22:22.458 --> 22:24.916
Good night, travelers.
The fire should die out in a few hours.

22:25.958 --> 22:28.083
Some things are easier to find
in the dark.

22:28.166 --> 22:29.291
Such as?

22:29.375 --> 22:30.333
Missing persons.

22:30.416 --> 22:31.416
Who are you?

22:31.500 --> 22:34.833
Cakesniffers whispering in a cave.
Is there anything less adorable?

22:35.208 --> 22:38.208
Come on. We don't socialize with orphans.

22:49.416 --> 22:51.750
-Do you think we can trust him?
-He must be with V.F.D.

22:51.833 --> 22:53.875
But why is he disguised as a Snow Scout?

22:54.416 --> 22:56.333
And why did he bring up  Anna Karenina?

22:56.416 --> 22:58.583
And why is he the only one wearing a mask?

22:58.666 --> 23:01.125
We'll find out when the fire dies.
He was right about one thing.

23:01.208 --> 23:04.125
It'll be easier to find Sunny when
it's dark and when Count Olaf is asleep.

23:06.583 --> 23:07.916
-Violet...
-Yeah?

23:09.666 --> 23:12.416
If one of our parents is alive,

23:12.500 --> 23:14.125
which one do you think it is?

23:14.583 --> 23:17.333
[wind whistling, fire crackling]

23:17.416 --> 23:18.666
There's no way to know.

23:19.958 --> 23:21.250
I keep wondering anyway.

23:23.750 --> 23:25.166
Me, too. [sighs]

23:29.125 --> 23:30.041
[grunts]

23:30.125 --> 23:33.000
This is probably a test. If we prove
to Count Olaf we can survive a night

23:33.083 --> 23:34.916
in this dark, freezing,
probably haunted wood,

23:35.000 --> 23:37.041
when we go back in the morning,
he'll be so impressed,

23:37.125 --> 23:40.166
he'll welcome us with open arms and say
all the nice things my dad never did.

23:40.250 --> 23:41.708
We don't have to go back at all.

23:41.791 --> 23:43.583
I've got some money saved up
from the carnival.

23:43.666 --> 23:45.625
We could buy a patch of farm
and live off the land.

23:45.708 --> 23:48.083
-What kind of crops would we grow?
-We could grow anything.

23:48.166 --> 23:50.375
It would be helpful
to visualize something specific.

23:50.458 --> 23:51.583
Could we grow rutabagas?

23:51.666 --> 23:53.541
We could grow literally anything!

23:53.625 --> 23:54.833
So sure, rutabagas.

23:54.916 --> 23:56.916
-I don't like rutabagas.
-Forget about the rutabagas!

23:57.000 --> 23:59.625
The point is, we still have time
to turn our lives around.

23:59.708 --> 24:02.208
And if we're on our own,
there won't be anyone to call us freaks.

24:02.291 --> 24:05.208
Not Count Olaf, not his troupe,
not even your dad.

24:06.083 --> 24:09.458
Madame Lulu always said,
"You deserve better."

24:09.541 --> 24:12.416
The Madame Lulu who got eaten by lions,
or the one who drove off in a taxi?

24:12.500 --> 24:13.833
I wonder whatever happened to her.

24:19.625 --> 24:20.708
Howdy, stranger.

24:21.250 --> 24:23.250
Hugo? Colette? Kevin?

24:23.333 --> 24:24.791
How does a stranger know our names?

24:24.875 --> 24:27.125
Listen to me, there are dangerous people
on this mountain.

24:27.208 --> 24:28.500
We know. We carpooled.

24:28.583 --> 24:30.500
-You have to leave now, before--
-[twig snaps]

24:30.583 --> 24:31.416
I'll lead them away.

24:31.833 --> 24:33.791
Wait! Do you know how to light a fire?

24:40.000 --> 24:41.208
[gasping]

24:41.291 --> 24:43.458
-[Kevin whispering] Thank you.
-You deserve better.

24:51.291 --> 24:52.166
What a nut job.

24:52.250 --> 24:54.333
Yeah, she acted like she knew us.
That was weird.

24:54.416 --> 24:57.291
Should she really be running around
the woods at night when she's pregnant?

24:57.375 --> 24:59.916
-I say she's the real freak, not us!
-Not like us!

25:00.000 --> 25:02.541
[all chanting] Not like us! Not like us!

25:03.833 --> 25:05.375
Ooh, anyone else feel that chill?

25:05.458 --> 25:06.333
Oh, hello.

25:08.000 --> 25:08.958
Nice night for it.

25:09.041 --> 25:09.916
Who are you?

25:10.000 --> 25:12.583
I wouldn't worry
about boring questions like that.

25:12.666 --> 25:14.625
-Lovely spot, isn't it?
-Secluded.

25:14.708 --> 25:17.375
-A warm fire.
-Yes, this will do nicely.

25:17.458 --> 25:20.208
You should leave. There are
dangerous people on this mountain.

25:20.291 --> 25:23.000
Yeah, us. We're dangerous criminals
in Count Olaf's troupe.

25:23.083 --> 25:24.875
You're here with little Olaf?

25:24.958 --> 25:26.083
He's just up on that summit.

25:26.166 --> 25:28.125
All we need to do is scream
and he'll come running.

25:28.208 --> 25:31.333
-That's a charming theory.
-Let's put it to the test.

25:33.541 --> 25:35.916
[screaming]

25:37.250 --> 25:38.291
Probably weasels.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.125
Those weren't weasels.

25:42.166 --> 25:43.000
[sniffing]

25:43.500 --> 25:46.666
Come on, Snicket. All you've got to do
is get off this mountain,

25:46.750 --> 25:50.208
evade your enemies and their eagles,
and safe-guard the sugar bowl.

25:53.708 --> 25:54.708
[sighs]

25:55.250 --> 25:56.208
The sugar bowl.

25:58.750 --> 26:00.750
[snoring]

26:08.791 --> 26:09.958
Shh!

26:10.041 --> 26:12.083
[snoring continues]

26:18.833 --> 26:21.666
I had to wait until the fire died down
so I could show you.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.833
[Violet] The Vertical Flame Diversion?

26:24.916 --> 26:27.000
It's not just a chimney,
it's a secret passageway.

26:27.083 --> 26:29.458
-How did you know it was here?
-I've read about it in a book

26:29.541 --> 26:31.958
called  The Incomplete History
of Secret Organizations.

26:32.041 --> 26:34.625
- We know that book. But how do--
-[Carmelita] What are you doing?

26:36.333 --> 26:37.916
Give me those earrings, Rachel.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.791
[sighs]

26:40.458 --> 26:41.291
Ugh!

26:42.916 --> 26:45.416
We don't know who you are.
How do we know we can trust you?

26:45.500 --> 26:47.625
"Xenial" is an adjective
that begins with X.

26:47.708 --> 26:49.500
It means being welcoming to strangers.

26:49.583 --> 26:52.333
Having a good vocabulary doesn't guarantee
that I'm a good person,

26:52.416 --> 26:53.750
but it does mean I've read a lot,

26:53.833 --> 26:56.458
and in my experience, well-read people
are less likely to be evil.

26:56.541 --> 26:57.583
[Carmelita sighs]

26:57.666 --> 27:01.208
I only watch network television.
[chuckles]

27:01.291 --> 27:02.125
[snores]

27:03.125 --> 27:05.416
You could take your mask off now.
They're asleep.

27:05.500 --> 27:07.291
But there are enemies everywhere.

27:07.666 --> 27:08.541
Follow me.

27:15.500 --> 27:18.375
[Carmelita giggles] Cake!

27:18.458 --> 27:19.875
[coughs]

27:19.958 --> 27:21.625
[snoring continues]

27:27.458 --> 27:28.458
[grunting]

27:39.750 --> 27:41.208
[Lemony]  Perhaps when you were young,

27:41.291 --> 27:44.750
someone sang a certain song to you
to lull you to sleep,

27:44.833 --> 27:46.791
or to entertain you on a long car trip,

27:46.875 --> 27:48.541
or in order to teach you a secret code.

27:48.625 --> 27:50.833
The song is "The Itsy Bitsy Spider,"

27:51.375 --> 27:54.000
and it is one of the saddest songs
ever composed.

27:54.083 --> 27:57.833
It tells the story of a small spider
who is trying to climb a water spout,

27:57.916 --> 27:59.875
only to be washed away again and again,

27:59.958 --> 28:02.875
until it seems that he will never
reach his destination.

28:02.958 --> 28:06.916
As the Baudelaires climbed the seemingly
endless Vertical Flame Diversion...

28:07.000 --> 28:08.333
[panting]

28:08.416 --> 28:10.833
...they could not help feeling
like that poor spider.

28:12.666 --> 28:14.166
-[Klaus] Spider!
-[Violet pants]

28:15.208 --> 28:16.708
[gasping]

28:20.916 --> 28:23.208
A pony party for me?

28:23.291 --> 28:25.333
And when Klaus stuck his hand
into a foothold

28:25.416 --> 28:27.458
serving as a spider condominium,

28:28.041 --> 28:30.375
he felt more like the spout.

28:32.041 --> 28:33.166
We're close.

28:34.416 --> 28:36.166
[Klaus] What do you think
we'll find up there?

28:36.750 --> 28:38.333
I know what I hope we'll find.

28:40.625 --> 28:42.208
[exhales]

28:43.666 --> 28:45.666
[straining]

28:46.250 --> 28:48.250
[wind whistling]

28:48.333 --> 28:50.333
[birds squawking]

29:05.166 --> 29:06.416
[yodeling]

29:23.416 --> 29:25.083
I thought I tied you up.

29:25.875 --> 29:27.458
What do you think you're doing?

29:32.041 --> 29:33.458
Hurry up with it.

29:33.958 --> 29:36.916
Wake up, everybody!

29:38.250 --> 29:39.583
We have a big day ahead of us.

29:39.666 --> 29:43.000
I'm going to need a little while
to figure out what to wear.

29:43.416 --> 29:45.916
It's not "in" to burn down
a secret headquarters

29:46.000 --> 29:48.333
without wearing a fashionable outfit.

29:48.791 --> 29:49.791
Well, tick-tock.

29:49.875 --> 29:52.541
The baby's making breakfast.
We'll have the henchpeople set the table.

29:52.625 --> 29:54.833
Oh, it's actually very "in"
to dine alfresco.

29:54.916 --> 29:56.416
You're thinking of  Al Funcoot.

29:56.958 --> 30:00.041
Believe me, I'm not.
Someone bring me some coffee!

30:00.125 --> 30:01.750
Or a brandy sidecar.

30:02.791 --> 30:04.666
You heard the lady. Breakfast!

30:11.583 --> 30:13.333
I think we can do better than that.

30:14.666 --> 30:17.291
The ice is pretty thin.
False Spring must be coming.

30:17.375 --> 30:20.041
We're right at the source
of Stricken Stream, so...

30:20.125 --> 30:21.166
there should be...

30:23.125 --> 30:25.416
Ah! Salmon galore!

30:25.500 --> 30:26.583
Yeah, here.

30:27.041 --> 30:29.083
Oh, here you go. There you go.

30:29.875 --> 30:31.583
[sighs]

30:31.666 --> 30:34.541
You ever go ice-fishing?
My stepdad used to take me.

30:36.041 --> 30:38.250
Oh, no, we just don't
see each other anymore.

30:38.541 --> 30:40.750
He didn't approve
of some of my life choices.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.375
It's tough losing family.

30:47.833 --> 30:50.666
You know, it wasn't my idea
to plunge your siblings to their deaths.

30:51.833 --> 30:54.000
Well, every career path has its drawbacks.

30:54.083 --> 30:57.041
Oftentimes, if you want to do theater,
you end up in a life of crime instead.

30:58.541 --> 31:00.666
Oh, God, you sound just like my stepdad.

31:01.541 --> 31:03.291
[Olaf] I'm starving!

31:05.000 --> 31:06.958
Look, don't tell anybody I said this...

31:07.791 --> 31:10.500
but I'll be glad if one of your parents
if still alive.

31:11.916 --> 31:13.125
[Olaf] I'm starving!

31:13.208 --> 31:14.083
Get moving, brat.

31:14.958 --> 31:17.250
Not too long ago
in the city of Stockholm,

31:17.333 --> 31:19.875
a group of bank robbers
took a few prisoners

31:19.958 --> 31:21.458
during the course of their work.

31:21.541 --> 31:24.083
And this vault is where we keep
all the fortunes,

31:24.166 --> 31:27.166
although I can't imagine you having
any interest in seeing big piles of money.

31:27.250 --> 31:29.250
I keep the combination to the vault
on the desk.

31:29.333 --> 31:30.916
It's taped to the three-hole punch.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.250
Now, this--

31:33.833 --> 31:36.291
For several days,
the bank robbers and prisoners

31:36.375 --> 31:38.625
lived together in close proximity,

31:38.708 --> 31:41.583
a word which here means
"while the police gathered outside

31:41.666 --> 31:44.333
and eventually managed
to take the robbers to jail."

31:44.708 --> 31:46.166
Do you have any nines?

31:47.125 --> 31:48.000
Go fish.

31:48.583 --> 31:49.833
Isn't this fun?!

31:49.916 --> 31:50.750
[crashing]

31:50.833 --> 31:52.625
Freeze!
Freeze!

31:52.708 --> 31:54.666
-Everybody freeze!
-[screaming] Stop!

31:54.750 --> 31:56.541
When the prisoners were finally freed,

31:56.625 --> 32:00.000
however, the authorities discovered
that they had become friends

32:00.083 --> 32:01.416
with the bank robbers.

32:01.875 --> 32:03.250
Keep in touch!

32:03.875 --> 32:06.333
Since that time,
the expression "Stockholm Syndrome"

32:06.416 --> 32:08.500
has been used to describe a situation

32:08.583 --> 32:11.250
in which prisoners
grow fond of their captors.

32:11.333 --> 32:13.416
But there is also

32:13.500 --> 32:16.666
an expression to describe
when captors grow fond of their prisoners.

32:22.083 --> 32:26.375
And that expression has become known
as "Mount Fraught Syndrome."

32:43.166 --> 32:44.291
-[mugs jangling]
-Hey!

32:44.375 --> 32:47.250
Look what the baby made.

32:47.916 --> 32:50.583
Sorbet, sashimi, and toast tartare.

32:50.666 --> 32:53.458
I had my doubts about putting a baby
in charge of the cooking...

32:53.541 --> 32:54.583
But this is delicious.

32:54.666 --> 32:56.958
It's a shame we're constantly
exploiting and threatening her

32:57.041 --> 32:59.541
when we could be nurturing her talents
for the collective good.

33:01.708 --> 33:04.833
What is this? I wanted orange juice.
This is just orange ice!

33:04.916 --> 33:07.416
This toast is raw.
Is it safe to eat raw toast?

33:07.500 --> 33:10.791
Of course it isn't.
That baby's trying to poison us!

33:12.125 --> 33:13.083
[gasping]

33:15.708 --> 33:18.208
I wanted a nice, hot breakfast,

33:18.291 --> 33:22.041
and instead, you brought me
this cold, disgusting nonsense.

33:22.125 --> 33:24.791
Maybe if I throw you off Mount Fraught,

33:24.875 --> 33:26.791
you'll learn your lesson.

33:34.375 --> 33:35.291
I'm kidding.

33:35.750 --> 33:37.500
I'd never throw you off a mountain.

33:37.583 --> 33:39.666
I need you to get your fortune.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.458
I just wanted to scare you.

33:41.541 --> 33:42.875
[forced laughter]

33:42.958 --> 33:46.000
[all laughing]

33:48.500 --> 33:49.625
[screaming]

33:50.291 --> 33:53.083
An aura of menace
is a distinct feeling of evil

33:53.166 --> 33:56.125
that accompanies
the arrival of certain people.

33:56.916 --> 34:00.333
Having an aura of menace
is like having a pet weasel

34:00.416 --> 34:02.666
because you rarely meet
someone who has one,

34:02.750 --> 34:05.666
and when you do, it makes you
want to hide under your desk.

34:07.208 --> 34:12.083
But there are some people that have
such a deep and lasting aura of menace

34:12.166 --> 34:14.166
that I cannot bring myself
to say their names,

34:14.250 --> 34:15.583
even after so many years,

34:15.666 --> 34:18.291
and will instead refer to them
the way almost everyone does,

34:18.375 --> 34:21.958
as the man with the beard and no hair,
and the woman with hair but no beard,

34:22.041 --> 34:26.833
although the very sight of them
might make you scream other names.

34:27.250 --> 34:28.416
Mommy! Daddy!

34:29.416 --> 34:31.083
Show some respect, Olaf.

34:31.625 --> 34:34.291
Is that any way to greet the people
who raised you?

34:34.875 --> 34:36.375
Boss, are these your parents?

34:36.458 --> 34:39.208
Only figuratively. They were my mentors.

34:39.291 --> 34:42.875
Yes. We played a crucial role
in your education, didn't we, Olaf?

34:42.958 --> 34:44.500
Taught you how to set fires.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.791
A few ants, a magnifying glass.

34:46.875 --> 34:48.666
You were lost before we recruited you.

34:48.750 --> 34:50.958
-You needed a push.
-A good, hard shove.

34:51.041 --> 34:52.916
Tell us, what have you been doing
with your life?

34:55.125 --> 34:55.958
Well...

34:57.500 --> 34:58.750
I am an actor.

34:58.833 --> 34:59.666
[scoffs]

34:59.750 --> 35:02.875
I've been glowingly mentioned
in reviews in several small magazines.

35:05.166 --> 35:06.083
This is my troupe.

35:07.416 --> 35:10.583
There are several carnival freaks
running around somewhere.

35:10.958 --> 35:11.875
Not anymore.

35:13.458 --> 35:16.250
-[clears throat]
-Oh, oh, oh! This is my girlfriend.

35:16.333 --> 35:18.291
Yes! I have a girlfriend.

35:18.833 --> 35:19.666
Good morning.

35:20.041 --> 35:22.625
-I'm Esmé Gigi--
-We know who you are.

35:22.708 --> 35:26.083
You moved into the penthouse
at 667 Dark Avenue.

35:26.166 --> 35:27.416
How did that work out?

35:27.500 --> 35:29.208
Jerome and I are having
a trial separation.

35:29.291 --> 35:30.833
We meant with the Quagmires.

35:30.916 --> 35:33.625
Quagmire. Oh, uh... It's been so long.

35:33.708 --> 35:35.041
I honestly can't remember.

35:35.125 --> 35:37.916
-Allow us to remind you.
-You lost those triplets.

35:38.000 --> 35:38.958
Twins, actually.

35:39.041 --> 35:42.291
After we went to all that trouble
to restrain their parents in Peru.

35:42.375 --> 35:43.958
You heard about the Quagmires?

35:44.041 --> 35:46.583
Oh, we've heard about
all your little mishaps, Olaf.

35:46.666 --> 35:49.583
How you've been foiled
by those irritating volunteers.

35:49.666 --> 35:51.083
And those three plucky children.

35:51.166 --> 35:53.625
Time and again.
What do you have to say for yourself?

35:53.708 --> 35:55.041
It wasn't my fault!

35:55.458 --> 35:56.291
It was theirs!

35:56.666 --> 35:59.375
I am surrounded
by incompetence and disloyalty!

35:59.458 --> 36:00.625
Hey, that's not fair.

36:00.708 --> 36:02.666
It's more than fair. It's totally true!

36:03.125 --> 36:05.583
I would be burning down
V.F.D. headquarters right now

36:05.666 --> 36:08.750
if these idiots hadn't insisted upon
waiting for breakfast first!

36:08.833 --> 36:10.250
Oh, Olaf.

36:10.333 --> 36:12.333
I wouldn't worry about the headquarters.

36:22.500 --> 36:24.583
This looks like the tunnel we found
under our house.

36:24.666 --> 36:26.666
V.F.D. built these passageways everywhere.

36:26.750 --> 36:29.250
An underground organization
needs a way to travel underground.

36:29.333 --> 36:32.083
According to the  The Incomplete History
of Secret Organizations,

36:32.166 --> 36:34.791
-the headquarters is behind that door.
-That's an impressive lock.

36:34.875 --> 36:37.708
-How does it open?
-It's called a Vernacularly Fastened Door.

36:37.791 --> 36:38.750
It opens with language.

36:38.833 --> 36:41.916
[Violet] The keyboard is wired to the
hinges. You have to type a phrase.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.666
Three phrases, and if you get them wrong,
it locks forever.

36:44.750 --> 36:46.875
[boy] The first phrase
is the name of the scientist

36:46.958 --> 36:49.625
most widely credited
with the discovery of gravity.

36:49.708 --> 36:51.041
That's easy. Sir Isaac Newton.

36:54.125 --> 36:55.333
[beeping]

36:55.416 --> 36:56.416
[lock clunks]

36:57.791 --> 36:58.833
What's next?

36:58.916 --> 37:01.291
The Latin name of the lions
found in the Hinterlands.

37:01.375 --> 37:03.583
-Panthero Leo.
-[masked boy] V.F.D. used to train them

37:03.666 --> 37:05.458
-before the schism.
-[beeping]

37:05.541 --> 37:06.500
[lock clunks]

37:07.750 --> 37:08.666
What's the last phrase?

37:08.750 --> 37:10.291
The third phrase is the central theme

37:10.375 --> 37:12.583
of the novel  Anna Karenina,
but I've never read it.

37:12.666 --> 37:14.250
That's why you asked about it earlier.

37:14.333 --> 37:16.083
You needed somebody
to help you open the door.

37:16.166 --> 37:17.458
There are people I'm looking for.

37:17.541 --> 37:18.750
-People I've lost.
-Us too.

37:19.625 --> 37:21.125
-Our mother.
-Our father.

37:23.041 --> 37:23.875
Sunny.

37:25.791 --> 37:28.500
We can find them, but only
if you can tell me the central theme

37:28.583 --> 37:29.916
of the novel  Anna Karenina.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.833
The central theme
of the novel  Anna Karenina...

37:31.916 --> 37:33.500
Is that a rural life
of moral simplicity...

37:33.583 --> 37:37.041
Is the preferable personal narrative
to a daring life of impulsive passion...

37:37.125 --> 37:39.583
Which only leads to tragedy.

37:40.750 --> 37:43.250
[sighs] Our mother had us memorize it.

37:43.750 --> 37:46.083
It's like she was preparing us
for this moment.

37:48.416 --> 37:49.291
We won't let her down.

37:55.791 --> 37:57.458
[lock squeals]

37:57.541 --> 37:58.625
Why isn't it opening?

37:58.708 --> 38:00.625
It sounded like it was working
till the last word.

38:00.708 --> 38:01.833
Maybe the mechanism is stuck.

38:01.916 --> 38:04.583
Or maybe a daring life of impulsive
passion leads to something else.

38:05.625 --> 38:09.333
A daring life of impulsive passion
can lead to many things.

38:09.416 --> 38:11.208
It can lead to a brave
and remarkable woman

38:11.291 --> 38:14.083
mourning a terrible loss
on the bank of a frozen stream.

38:14.166 --> 38:15.458
I've lost the sugar bowl.

38:16.666 --> 38:18.083
I lost everything.

38:21.083 --> 38:22.916
-[coughing]
-It can lead to a banker

38:23.000 --> 38:25.916
making a surprising
and out of character return.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.125
Excuse me, miss.

38:27.708 --> 38:30.250
I've lost my map,
and I have no idea where I am.

38:30.791 --> 38:33.583
You shouldn't be here.
This mountain is dangerous.

38:33.666 --> 38:36.500
Well, so is the city.
I just experienced a bank robbery,

38:36.583 --> 38:38.458
and Mr. Tamerlane
seems to think it was my fault,

38:38.541 --> 38:41.041
so I decided it best to get out of town
as fast as I could

38:41.125 --> 38:43.416
and search for some orphans
I seem to have misplaced.

38:43.833 --> 38:44.833
[coughs]

38:46.000 --> 38:46.916
That's funny.

38:47.666 --> 38:49.958
[coughs] I just had the oddest feeling,

38:50.041 --> 38:52.333
like a daring, impulsive passion...

38:53.208 --> 38:54.875
that someone nearby was in trouble.

38:56.500 --> 38:58.625
You haven't seen anyone in trouble,
have you, miss?

39:00.041 --> 39:04.083
[sighs] A woman in your condition
shouldn't be out here all alone.

39:04.166 --> 39:05.000
No...

39:05.625 --> 39:06.541
[sniffs]

39:06.625 --> 39:07.583
No, she shouldn't.

39:09.083 --> 39:10.125
Let me help you.

39:12.958 --> 39:13.791
[sniffs]

39:15.458 --> 39:16.458
Thanks.

39:17.708 --> 39:18.541
[knocking]

39:18.625 --> 39:22.541
In my own case,
a daring life of impulsive passion

39:22.625 --> 39:24.875
has led to false accusations...

39:24.958 --> 39:26.416
[hammering on door]

39:26.500 --> 39:27.833
...and a life on the run.

39:27.916 --> 39:29.916
[knocking continues]

39:31.000 --> 39:35.208
But in the case of Anna Karenina,
a daring life of impulsive passion

39:35.291 --> 39:36.750
-leads only to tragedy.
-[beeping]

39:38.666 --> 39:40.333
And Violet was right.

39:40.416 --> 39:42.375
[machine whirs]

39:44.333 --> 39:46.791
-The mechanism was stuck.
-[lock clunks]

39:51.458 --> 39:54.333
We could walk in on the entire
organization having a meeting.

39:55.625 --> 39:56.916
Or one of our parents.

40:04.083 --> 40:05.416
[coughing]

40:13.541 --> 40:15.375
-[Klaus] Mother?
-[Violet] Father!

40:25.041 --> 40:26.541
-Mother?
-Father!

40:27.583 --> 40:30.000
You don't have to worry
about the headquarters...

40:30.083 --> 40:32.208
Because we burned them down ourselves.

40:33.125 --> 40:35.041
[woman]  First, we burned down the kitchen.

40:35.125 --> 40:35.958
No!

40:36.041 --> 40:39.166
Then we burned down the parlor,
then the disguise room, the ballroom,

40:39.250 --> 40:41.291
and all six inventing labs.

40:41.375 --> 40:44.833
We burned down the classrooms,
and the movie theater, and the hot tub,

40:44.916 --> 40:46.791
which was very hard to burn.

40:46.875 --> 40:48.791
And finally, we burned down the library.

40:48.875 --> 40:51.541
[man]  That was my favorite part.
Books, and books, and books...

40:51.625 --> 40:54.083
[woman]  All turned to ash,
so no one can read them.

40:54.166 --> 40:55.583
So many secrets...

40:55.666 --> 40:57.083
No one will ever learn now.

40:57.166 --> 40:59.416
[woman]  It's all gone up in smoke.

40:59.500 --> 41:00.375
No!

41:00.458 --> 41:01.833
No!

41:02.291 --> 41:04.541
-Well, well.
-Who do we have here?

41:04.625 --> 41:08.000
Oh, you are going to love this.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.125
[Violet] It's all gone.

41:13.416 --> 41:15.750
This is where everything has led us.
The maps, the codes...

41:15.833 --> 41:16.708
The Snicket file.

41:16.791 --> 41:18.500
One of our parents has to be here!

41:19.250 --> 41:21.750
Jacques Snicket said
there was a survivor of the fire.

41:21.833 --> 41:22.708
There is.

41:23.250 --> 41:24.541
-Where?
-Here.

41:25.583 --> 41:27.458
I survived the fire
that destroyed my home.

41:31.208 --> 41:32.208
Duncan?

41:32.291 --> 41:33.125
Quigley.

41:34.041 --> 41:35.166
Quigley Quagmire.

41:43.916 --> 41:45.916
[theme music playing]
