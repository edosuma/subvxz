00:10.144 --> 00:11.545
- Who did the drugs belong to?
- Meachum.

00:11.579 --> 00:13.114

CIA?

She's coming with us.

[gunshot, explosion]
- [screams]

00:22.656 --> 00:24.392
I don't want to feel like
I'm trapped here.

00:24.425 --> 00:26.160
I want to go home.
- I get it. I get it.

00:26.194 --> 00:28.229
- I'm sorry.
- Don't let me see you again.

00:28.262 --> 00:30.231
- Yeah?

00:30.264 --> 00:31.399
- We got to get out of here now.
[guns firing]

Lin, Lin...

00:33.401 --> 00:36.104
I came here
on a valid passport.

00:36.137 --> 00:38.239
You had no right to stop me.
- Why is there an Interpol

00:38.272 --> 00:41.442
Orange Notice indicating you are
a threat to national security?

00:41.475 --> 00:43.844
- Patricia Gregson.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.546
- Heinrichs, Federal Police.

00:45.579 --> 00:47.548
- Does the name Golden Crescent
mean anything to you?

00:47.581 --> 00:50.484
- Golden Crescent,
an Arab crime syndicate.

00:50.518 --> 00:52.520
You need to clean out
the warehouse immediately.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.555
- I'm calling to speak
with Officer Franz Heinrichs.

00:54.588 --> 00:57.258
- He was killed in the line
of duty last week, ma'am.

01:00.494 --> 01:03.297
- This wasn't terrorism.
It was murder.

01:03.331 --> 01:05.866
We're being hunted.

03:58.272 --> 04:00.508
- I know what Kevin and Edgar
meant to you.

04:01.742 --> 04:05.513
- Yeah, I thought the days of
losing my brothers were over.

04:05.546 --> 04:09.583
Just wish I knew
what happened.

04:09.617 --> 04:13.454
- What do you mean?
I thought it was terrorists.

04:13.487 --> 04:15.289
- They had some help.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.693
But, Jules,
I need you to know

04:19.727 --> 04:21.495
that there's no place
safer for you and Mary

04:21.529 --> 04:24.498
than right where we are now.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.644
I'm guessing you're here
about Frankfurt?

04:38.479 --> 04:40.748
- They killed my wife.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.483
[door closes]

04:42.516 --> 04:44.385
Give me some weapons,
point me in a direction,

04:44.418 --> 04:46.454
and I'll do whatever
you need me to do.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.358
- I already gave you
that chance.

04:50.391 --> 04:54.328
The real problem
is about to reveal itself.

04:57.431 --> 04:59.633
- You have other people
for that.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.602
- You refused.

05:01.635 --> 05:05.806
A year ago, you could've put
a stop to this heroin business.

05:05.839 --> 05:08.542
Now I got a well-respected
newspaper

05:08.576 --> 05:10.110
getting very close
to revealing the truth.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.579
- You didn't tell me
the whole story?

05:11.612 --> 05:12.980
- Isaac--

05:13.013 --> 05:14.748
- You didn't say
they'd kill my wife!

05:14.782 --> 05:16.750
- And you should know that
when I ask for something,

05:16.784 --> 05:18.686
it's very important.

05:18.719 --> 05:21.622
- Because you always see what's
coming down the line, right?

05:24.525 --> 05:27.428
- Your being here...

05:27.461 --> 05:29.730

a problem for me.

06:31.725 --> 06:34.428
- So the, uh, senator
noticed the effort,

06:34.462 --> 06:37.130
and he offered me his box seats
to the ballet this Friday.

06:37.164 --> 06:39.199
I thought
maybe we could go.

You don't like the ballet?

[scoffs] It's work.

how my job works.

06:54.181 --> 06:55.849
- What is the, uh, issue?

06:58.852 --> 07:01.188
- I discovered something
in Frankfurt,

07:01.221 --> 07:03.457
and I know Patricia knows,

07:03.491 --> 07:05.893
but she hasn't
asked me about it.

07:05.926 --> 07:09.196
- Welcome to DC.
Plausible deniability.

07:09.229 --> 07:11.632
It should be the city's motto.
- True.

07:11.665 --> 07:15.202
But...Patricia always sees
seven steps ahead.

07:15.235 --> 07:17.104
She knows I wouldn't
just go to Frankfurt,

07:17.137 --> 07:19.172
put Swagger on a plane,
and come home.

07:19.206 --> 07:21.709
Every evaluation I've ever had
says I paint outside the lines,

07:21.742 --> 07:24.645
and she hired me anyway.

07:24.678 --> 07:26.847
- So what are you gonna do?

07:26.880 --> 07:29.483
- My job.

07:59.212 --> 08:01.915
- The correct term is ambush.

- If I wanted to ambush you,
I wouldn't call first.

08:06.754 --> 08:08.822
Don't make me
find you, please.

08:08.856 --> 08:10.724

the pink one with the hearts

09:02.710 --> 09:04.645
or the blue one
with the polka dots?

09:04.678 --> 09:05.779

with the hearts.

09:05.813 --> 09:07.581
What do you think, Estella?

09:07.615 --> 09:09.617
- Oh, sÃ­, mi amor.

09:09.650 --> 09:13.020
The one with the hearts
goes perfectly with her shoes.

but she's no kitten mouse.

09:25.265 --> 09:27.968
before Joey kills me.
- Why? Did he call?

09:28.001 --> 09:29.937

You know how he gets.

09:29.970 --> 09:32.005
But I'll be back
real soon.

09:44.718 --> 09:46.654
Anything else
would look suspicious.

you're swigging on,

09:48.121 --> 09:50.057

with a new roasting technique.

09:52.726 --> 09:55.629
Hey, you're carrying for this?

09:55.663 --> 09:56.997

of meeting.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.100
I'm strapped.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.836
What are the rules
of engagement?

get killed.

in the chow hall.

One cup of this,
and you'll be up for three days.

11:16.476 --> 11:18.045

I had a cup last night.

11:18.078 --> 11:20.013
I can't close my eyes.

11:21.481 --> 11:23.016

- Oh, really?

11:23.050 --> 11:24.484
And how long do you think
it's gonna take

to go bad?

11:26.253 --> 11:28.922

has come and gone.

- Oh, I got to call your wife.

11:34.795 --> 11:37.865
- I can't wait to meet her.
- Yeah, call mine, too.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.232
Tell her
I'm leaving her for Dobbs.

back from Bagram?

11:53.847 --> 11:55.983

want to see me?

11:58.485 --> 12:00.120
with some civilian bigwig.

12:02.189 --> 12:04.257

that heroin we found.

12:04.291 --> 12:05.893
- Or the mullah's wife.

12:05.926 --> 12:07.761
I want to hand her
to the Afghans,

12:07.795 --> 12:10.497

are to keep her in custody.

12:12.332 --> 12:15.468
Guess I'll find out
soon enough.

Dobbs, you on him?

- Yeah, I got him.

12:35.823 --> 12:37.324
- You had to bring Dobbs?

If I was gunning for you,
I wouldn't have asked to meet.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.994

12:41.028 --> 12:42.830
before I get sick
of hearing your voice.

12:42.863 --> 12:44.231
- That attack in Frankfurt
wasn't random.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.899
It's retaliation
for the heroin trade

12:45.933 --> 12:49.036
we disrupted in Helmand.

12:49.069 --> 12:51.204
As usual,
your two steps behind.

you're gonna need my help.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.008
Those guys tracked me down
in Bangkok.

12:55.042 --> 12:56.944
They're for real.

12:56.977 --> 12:59.546
- If these guys are so badass,
how come you're still alive?

13:05.853 --> 13:07.554
- They killed Lin.

13:07.587 --> 13:10.824
[suspenseful music]

13:10.858 --> 13:13.026
- I'm sorry to hear that,

13:13.060 --> 13:15.328
but I'm not working
with you.

13:15.362 --> 13:17.564
- Don't be shortsighted.
- No.

13:17.597 --> 13:19.166
Now, correct me
if I'm wrong,

13:19.199 --> 13:20.968
but last time
he agreed to work for you,

13:21.001 --> 13:22.836
he ended up
America's most wanted.

and whoever it is

13:25.939 --> 13:27.841
thinks that wives and children
are fair game.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.109
- Just like when you took
my family?

13:29.142 --> 13:30.543

Bob Lee--

13:30.577 --> 13:32.846
- It was all
because of you, asshole!

13:32.880 --> 13:35.248
- Bob Lee...

13:35.282 --> 13:38.251
do I need to remind you
whose house this is?

13:38.285 --> 13:39.920

13:39.953 --> 13:42.055
- No, Father.

13:42.089 --> 13:45.158
Sorry about the guns.
- Guns? [chuckles]

13:45.192 --> 13:47.194
This is Texas.

13:47.227 --> 13:50.330
I've seen plenty of guns
in church.

13:50.363 --> 13:53.100
My concern...

13:53.133 --> 13:55.268
is you look like
you're about to use yours.

13:55.302 --> 13:58.872

13:58.906 --> 14:00.874
- Not gonna come
to that, Padre.

We're all just
saying good-bye.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.635
[indistinct chatter]

14:31.338 --> 14:33.340
- I was working
for my first paper.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.142
I wrote a puff piece

14:35.175 --> 14:37.344
about how Nixon
fed Checkers food

14:37.377 --> 14:39.913
from the White House
dinner table.

14:39.947 --> 14:42.182
Apparently he never forgot.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.151
I'm surprised
I wasn't ranked higher.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.920
- Hey, at least you made
the top 20.

14:46.954 --> 14:50.690
- So what can I do for you,
Agent Memphis?

14:50.723 --> 14:53.126
- Doing research
on Afghani heroin

14:53.160 --> 14:55.262
and came across an article
written by a reporter of yours--

14:55.295 --> 14:57.965
Jeffrey Denning.

14:57.998 --> 15:00.667
Problem is no one seems to know
where to find him.

15:00.700 --> 15:03.070
- And I thought you might be
here to give me an exclusive

15:03.103 --> 15:07.340
on what really happened
with Bob Lee Swagger last year.

15:07.374 --> 15:09.176
Or was it a coincidence

15:09.209 --> 15:11.444
that every cabinet-level
intelligence chief in town

15:11.478 --> 15:13.246
made sure
we didn't poke too hard

15:13.280 --> 15:15.015
into the official story?

15:15.048 --> 15:17.284
- I want a face-to-face
with Denning.

15:18.986 --> 15:20.988
- Then I can't help you.

15:21.021 --> 15:22.956
- Mr. Broadwell,
I work for Patricia Gregson--

15:22.990 --> 15:24.992
- That's a nice name
to drop,

15:25.025 --> 15:28.061
but you'll need more firepower
for me to give up a reporter.

15:28.095 --> 15:31.198
- Give up?
Where is he?

15:31.231 --> 15:33.233
- Sabbatical.
- Forced?

15:35.402 --> 15:38.271
- What is it exactly you need,
Agent Memphis?

15:38.305 --> 15:40.007
- I need to talk to him

15:40.040 --> 15:41.708
about the Golden Crescent

15:41.741 --> 15:43.676
and an international
heroin ring

15:43.710 --> 15:46.013
with possible ties
to the U.S. government.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.117
Look, I get that
Denning is afraid.

15:50.150 --> 15:53.053
Let him know that
I'm here to help.

15:53.086 --> 15:56.723
Or I could have the Bureau
file a missing-persons report,

15:56.756 --> 15:59.392
have all sorts of people
looking for him.

15:59.426 --> 16:01.694
Your choice.

16:01.728 --> 16:05.365
- These are confusing times,
Agent Memphis.

16:05.398 --> 16:08.368
Hard to know
who you can trust.

16:08.401 --> 16:11.704
- You've been in this town
a long time, Mr. Broadwell.

16:11.738 --> 16:15.042
Won't take you ten minutes
to find out whose side I'm on.

16:16.376 --> 16:18.711
After you have...

16:18.745 --> 16:22.049
tell him to give me a call.

if I let go?

unnecessary.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.356
No one's gonna shoot you.

18:43.390 --> 18:45.892
- Tell that to Vigo
and his friends.

18:45.925 --> 18:48.361
- You've had six years
to bury this mess.

18:48.395 --> 18:50.630
If your face was exposed
after everything we've done,

18:50.663 --> 18:53.166
the CIA's gonna go
into damage control.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.268
They're gonna point
the finger at us.

18:55.302 --> 18:58.438
Then people are gonna start
disappearing or going to jail.

18:58.471 --> 19:01.574
I had to protect
the rest of the organization.

19:19.259 --> 19:21.194
Give me a month...

19:21.228 --> 19:24.431

back channels.

19:24.464 --> 19:26.966
You owe me that much.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.701

that Bob Lee Swagger

19:28.735 --> 19:30.237
has been drawn into this?

19:30.270 --> 19:33.540
- Yes. Unfortunate.

get catastrophic.

19:58.365 --> 20:01.734
- Captain Johnson, forgive me.
Would you like a drink?

20:01.768 --> 20:03.336
- I'll settle for a clue
of who you are

20:03.370 --> 20:04.471
and what the hell
am I doing here.

20:04.504 --> 20:06.239
- Patricia Gregson,

20:06.273 --> 20:09.376
Deputy Director
Defense Intelligence Agency.

20:10.777 --> 20:12.812
Why don't we have a seat?

20:18.885 --> 20:21.521
It's come to my attention
that your team made

20:21.554 --> 20:24.757
a very interesting discovery
on your last mission.

20:24.791 --> 20:27.260
- I guess bad news
travels fast.

20:27.294 --> 20:30.997
- It's my job to prevent it
from traveling further.

20:31.030 --> 20:33.933
That trafficking route
used to belong to the Russians,

20:33.966 --> 20:36.035
the FSB, to be clear,

20:36.068 --> 20:39.806
but last year Hugh Meachum,
on behalf of the CIA,

20:39.839 --> 20:42.309
appropriated those routes,
effectively taking over.

20:42.342 --> 20:44.344
- The CIA's
in the heroin business?

20:44.377 --> 20:46.513
- They got very good at it
during Vietnam.

20:46.546 --> 20:48.948
- It sounds like a problem
between three-letter agencies.

20:48.981 --> 20:50.917
Nothing my team
can do about it.

20:50.950 --> 20:53.052
- Not your team.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.288
You.

20:55.322 --> 20:58.825
- It's not my job.
- Hugh Meachum likes you.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.493
- He seemed okay with me
getting killed a month ago.

21:00.527 --> 21:02.562
- In Musa Qala, yes.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.397
But the fact that
he's still working with you

21:04.431 --> 21:05.798
means he trust you.

21:05.832 --> 21:08.301
Use that.
Help me stop him.

21:08.335 --> 21:10.737
- Again, not interested.

fetch me coffee...

21:16.476 --> 21:18.511
I'm not asking.

21:18.545 --> 21:20.413
Stumbling onto
those heroin routes

21:20.447 --> 21:23.883
has put you and your men
in more danger than you realize.

- Yeah.

Gunnery Sergeant Swagger.
- Gar Winston.

21:48.641 --> 21:51.811
We were on our way to a meeting
in Marjah when we took fire,

21:51.844 --> 21:54.447
and the truck took one
in the fuel tank.

21:54.481 --> 21:56.383

in our neighborhood.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.889
- Where you from, Swagger?

22:02.922 --> 22:05.792
- Texas.
- Never would've guessed.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.527
Most Texans I know
are smart enough

22:07.560 --> 22:09.462
to stay on their side
of the fence.

22:09.496 --> 22:11.631
Once we get the truck
patched up, we'll be on our way.

22:11.664 --> 22:14.033
- You boys need any help?
- No, no, we're good.

22:14.066 --> 22:16.369

about an hour ago.

on moving her?

want us talking to her, man.

he's gonna answer questions

Why didn't you come to me
whenever I called you?

24:28.267 --> 24:30.937

to scare Lauren.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.772
- Honey,
why would Lauren be scared?

24:32.805 --> 24:35.775

when Daddy's not here.

24:35.808 --> 24:38.645
That's why I brought her
to the bathtub,

Polish or Maltese?

has been to Germany recently.

are you doing, man?

in the last three days,
he's the one who killed Lin.

the best lead we have.

We need it.

that's an ambush.

26:32.825 --> 26:35.394
- Well, you took away
any other option we had.

26:35.427 --> 26:37.163
- We don't even know
what he looks like.

26:37.196 --> 26:38.330
- Well, I'm guessing
he's gonna be the one

26:38.364 --> 26:39.398
that's trying to kill us.

He'll try and ambush you.
Let him.

Make sure he brings you
out front, and I'll be waiting.

you're not Solotov.

the containment business.

Dropping my name
to Charles Broadwell

of that.

you're upset, Patricia.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.468
You knew who I was
when you hired me.

30:36.502 --> 30:39.505

not recklessness, Nadine.

30:39.538 --> 30:41.440

information that I need.

Do you think
I don't know that?

I've spent the last six years
of my life trying to hide it.

30:49.048 --> 30:50.616

30:50.649 --> 30:53.152
- They're hunting Swagger.

Let me give you
some advice, Nadine.

30:56.122 --> 30:59.025
If your friends keep
getting you into trouble,

they're not your friends.

he will.

31:07.099 --> 31:09.601
- And what about Swagger?

31:09.635 --> 31:11.537
- He's a tough boy.

31:11.570 --> 31:15.074
He can take care of himself.

31:15.107 --> 31:18.110
If you come across any more
intel about the heroin ring,

31:18.144 --> 31:21.080
bring it to me,
then contain it.

31:21.113 --> 31:23.115
Understood?

with me, Swagger.

If the tables were turned,
she'd sell you out

32:09.195 --> 32:10.662

32:10.696 --> 32:13.499
- Don't you mean heroin?

32:13.532 --> 32:16.035
We have standing orders
to hold her in our custody.

32:16.068 --> 32:18.170
- No, your orders
were to hold her

32:18.204 --> 32:20.239
until we came
and got her, dumbass.

32:20.272 --> 32:22.041
- Great.

As soon as I hear
from my superior officer,

32:23.742 --> 32:25.277
she's all yours.

32:30.216 --> 32:32.184

do their job, yeah?

Haircut.

We are Marines.

Won't be the last.

starts going crazy.

We tried to talk to him.

you had a black fella with you.

with the law.

33:54.833 --> 33:56.602
I don't want to get him
in trouble.

33:56.635 --> 33:58.337
- Well, we can leave him
out of it for now,

33:58.370 --> 33:59.838
but I'm gonna need you
to come down to the station

33:59.871 --> 34:02.174
to give a statement.

34:02.208 --> 34:04.376
Mind if I stop home
and give Mary a kiss?

34:28.867 --> 34:31.603

34:33.205 --> 34:34.873

we wouldn't have made it
from the trucks to this barn.

34:36.908 --> 34:38.644

he's not on his way.

Bob Lee.

Why would Solotov
want to kill us?

34:42.281 --> 34:44.183
He had nothing to do
with that heroin we found.

certain of anything.

about it, after all the shit

that we did together
back in the day,

to everybody?

You got your family here,

35:10.242 --> 35:11.877
might know that my girl's
back in Lubbock.

her and bring her back here.

35:14.380 --> 35:15.714
We're safer as a team.

safer as a team?

at the diner

- Caffeine makes me twitchy.
- Not me. I'm special.

37:44.530 --> 37:46.532
I can drink a gallon and still
stay steady on the gun.

37:46.565 --> 37:48.300
- Yeah?

37:48.334 --> 37:50.869
I think the only thing
steady about you is

37:50.902 --> 37:53.572
the constant stream of nonsense
coming out of your mouth.

37:53.605 --> 37:55.374
- I'm just trying
to help you out.

37:55.407 --> 37:57.376
- Thanks, thanks.

38:03.114 --> 38:04.850
You mind giving me a minute?

38:04.883 --> 38:06.552
- No, I get it.

38:06.585 --> 38:09.054
Hey, are you gonna tell him
about last night?

38:09.087 --> 38:11.056
- Depends on
what he tells me first.

38:11.089 --> 38:12.624
- Captain.

38:12.658 --> 38:14.626
- How'd it go up in Kabul?

38:17.128 --> 38:20.599
- [sighs] Turns out
it's just a bunch of bigwigs

38:20.632 --> 38:22.033
who feel they need to justify
their existence

38:22.067 --> 38:23.702
with PowerPoint slides.

38:23.735 --> 38:25.471
Total waste of time.

38:25.504 --> 38:27.072
- Once again, I'm glad
I'm not an officer.

38:27.105 --> 38:28.574
- [chuckles]

38:28.607 --> 38:31.042
You definitely
weren't built to...

38:31.076 --> 38:33.412
handle the bullshit
that rolls downhill.

38:33.445 --> 38:34.980
- Hey, I'm fine
with bullshit.

38:35.013 --> 38:37.383
I'm just glad my role
is cleaning it up,

38:37.416 --> 38:40.118
not creating it.

38:40.151 --> 38:42.554
- How'd things go
in my absence?

38:42.588 --> 38:44.990
- Nothing to report.

38:45.023 --> 38:46.525
- Good.

38:46.558 --> 38:48.026
Look, I'm gonna go get
cleaned up.

38:48.059 --> 38:49.561
Meet me at the TOC in 20.

38:49.595 --> 38:51.129
Got some things
I want to go over.

38:51.162 --> 38:53.131
- Okay, boss.

38:53.164 --> 38:56.134
[suspenseful music]

38:56.167 --> 39:00.539

39:07.513 --> 39:10.516
[cell phone vibrating]

39:20.459 --> 39:23.462
[cell phone chimes]

39:33.672 --> 39:35.006
- [scoffs softly]

39:35.040 --> 39:42.047
*

39:50.055 --> 39:51.590
- I mean, I--I--I--I--

39:51.623 --> 39:53.592
I can't even believe this.
W-what--

39:53.625 --> 39:55.126
You don't know who they are,
you don't know who sent them,

39:55.160 --> 39:57.162
and now Solotov
might be one of them?

39:57.195 --> 39:59.565
- Baby, I'm sorry.
I wish I had more answers.

39:59.598 --> 40:01.099
- No, I don't--
I don't want answers.

40:01.132 --> 40:03.134
I don't. I just want it
to stop, all right?

40:03.168 --> 40:04.770
I can't--
I can't go through this again.

40:04.803 --> 40:06.538
Mary cannot
go through this again.

40:06.572 --> 40:08.139
- I'm gonna talk to
the rest of the group,

40:08.173 --> 40:09.708
and we're gonna figure it out.
- Figure it out?

40:09.741 --> 40:11.076
How?

40:11.109 --> 40:13.712
How?
- I don't know yet.

40:13.745 --> 40:15.547
What the hell?

40:15.581 --> 40:16.982
- [scoffs]

40:26.592 --> 40:28.694
- What's going on? I told you
I'd come down tomorrow.

40:28.727 --> 40:31.697
- This ain't about that.
At least I hope it isn't.

40:31.730 --> 40:34.099
- What's it about now?

40:34.132 --> 40:35.467
- There's been an incident.

40:35.501 --> 40:37.002
[gunshot]

40:37.035 --> 40:39.705
[somber music]

40:39.738 --> 40:41.807
Your buddy Dobbs
got shot to death.

40:41.840 --> 40:43.809
*

40:43.842 --> 40:46.578
Looks like it might have been
a robbery.

40:46.612 --> 40:48.780
I'm real sorry, Bob Lee.

40:48.814 --> 40:55.821
*

41:02.293 --> 41:05.263
[tense music]

41:05.296 --> 41:12.504
