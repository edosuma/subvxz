00:00.322 --> 00:03.072
(dramatic music)

00:16.472 --> 00:19.222
(birds chirping)

00:20.498 --> 00:22.712
(faucet trickling)

00:22.713 --> 00:23.869
- Shit!

00:23.870 --> 00:25.835
(laughing)

00:25.860 --> 00:26.955
- You scared me.

00:26.956 --> 00:27.915
(man moaning)

00:27.940 --> 00:29.186
- Where's your mom?

00:29.211 --> 00:30.380
- She's at the store.

00:30.381 --> 00:31.930
She'll be back in like an hour.

00:34.490 --> 00:35.690
- You like staying here?

00:36.749 --> 00:38.149
This is a nice place, right?

00:39.150 --> 00:40.733
- Yeah.

00:40.734 --> 00:43.209
- I'm a good guy, huh?

00:43.210 --> 00:44.679
You like me?

00:44.680 --> 00:45.680
- I guess.

00:47.160 --> 00:49.669
- Anything I could help you with?

00:49.670 --> 00:51.147
Anything I can do for you?

00:53.249 --> 00:55.982
I just wanna be there for you, that's all.

00:55.983 --> 00:58.513
Maybe you need a little extra cash.

01:00.018 --> 01:02.124
(chuckling)

01:02.125 --> 01:03.697
I know you done this before.

01:04.614 --> 01:06.104
- A hundred bucks?

01:06.175 --> 01:07.243
Really?

01:07.244 --> 01:09.063
I'm a little more expensive than my mom.

01:11.014 --> 01:12.042
Ow!

01:12.043 --> 01:13.043
Shit.

01:13.670 --> 01:15.700
- You got just as bad
of a fucking attitude!

01:16.081 --> 01:17.798
- What the fuck are you doing?!

01:17.823 --> 01:19.449
Get the fuck away from her!

01:19.450 --> 01:21.225
- Fucking join in, bitch!

01:21.226 --> 01:23.893
(woman yelling)

01:25.090 --> 01:28.167
Teach your bitch kid some fucking manners!

01:29.596 --> 01:31.205
(glass shattering)
(screaming)

01:31.206 --> 01:32.622
Do it, bitch!

01:32.623 --> 01:35.373
(dramatic music)

01:37.009 --> 01:39.759
(mother yelling)

01:46.766 --> 01:49.183
(whimpering)

02:13.985 --> 02:16.735
(dramatic music)

02:51.765 --> 02:52.965
- Hey.

02:52.966 --> 02:54.204
This has got to stop.

02:54.205 --> 02:55.404
Get your shit together.

02:55.405 --> 02:56.771
We're getting out of here.

02:56.772 --> 02:58.272
Come on, let's go.

02:59.173 --> 03:00.250
Come on!

03:00.251 --> 03:01.251
- Okay.

03:07.581 --> 03:10.331
(city commotion)

03:19.383 --> 03:20.383
- Christ.

03:49.542 --> 03:51.042
Throw me my phone.

03:52.060 --> 03:53.060
Thanks.

03:55.123 --> 03:56.123
Shit.

03:57.080 --> 03:59.299
Thank God we've got a guy
coming here in 10 minutes

03:59.300 --> 04:00.813
who can pay for this shit.

04:03.560 --> 04:04.760
Fuck, where's my makeup?

04:11.760 --> 04:12.760
Can you see it?

04:14.720 --> 04:15.720
- Sorta.

04:16.831 --> 04:18.060
But it's pretty dark in here.

04:18.060 --> 04:20.059
He probably won't notice.

04:20.060 --> 04:22.671
- You wanna wait in the
bathroom or the car?

04:22.696 --> 04:23.750
- Bathroom.

04:23.751 --> 04:25.219
- Actually, wait in the car.

04:25.220 --> 04:27.323
You're getting too big
to hide in the shower.

04:30.010 --> 04:31.023
- Okay.

04:31.024 --> 04:32.123
Got my vaporizer in there?

04:34.070 --> 04:35.070
Thanks.

04:35.915 --> 04:36.954
- Hey.

04:36.955 --> 04:39.037
You forgetting something?

04:40.377 --> 04:42.317
Give it 45 minutes, Max.

04:42.318 --> 04:43.318
- Okay.

04:44.936 --> 04:47.519
(door closing)

04:48.551 --> 04:51.134
(men chatting)

04:57.529 --> 04:59.239
- [Man] What's up, Nina?

04:59.240 --> 05:01.474
- What's up, girl?

05:01.475 --> 05:05.255
(distant police siren)

05:05.256 --> 05:06.256
- Hey.

05:17.930 --> 05:20.680
(birds chirping)

05:25.565 --> 05:27.170
(knocking)

05:27.194 --> 05:28.350
- Fix this.

05:28.351 --> 05:30.670
It looks like shit, I'm telling you.

05:31.970 --> 05:33.367
Hey.

05:33.368 --> 05:34.516
- Hola, Kimmy.

05:34.517 --> 05:35.629
(chuckling)

05:35.630 --> 05:36.689
- Oh, come on.

05:36.690 --> 05:37.696
Honey, I missed you.

05:37.721 --> 05:40.036
Show me some love.

05:40.037 --> 05:41.683
This is my baby girl, Shara.

05:43.260 --> 05:44.260
- Hi.

05:44.950 --> 05:46.300
- Yeah, Cap, how you doing?

05:49.539 --> 05:51.364
All right, fuck it, come on in.

05:51.365 --> 05:53.198
- All right, let's go.

06:06.218 --> 06:08.549
(groaning)

06:08.550 --> 06:10.969
- Room's 300 bucks a month.

06:10.970 --> 06:12.533
All the utilities are included.

06:13.490 --> 06:16.040
You have a small fridge
and a hotplate right there.

06:17.022 --> 06:18.689
- This is so ghetto.

06:20.240 --> 06:21.240
- Get out.

06:24.659 --> 06:26.199
- Is she always fucking like that?

06:26.200 --> 06:27.200
- Yes.

06:28.772 --> 06:29.772
- Fuck.

06:33.255 --> 06:34.609
Washer and dryer.

06:34.610 --> 06:36.139
If you wanna use that

06:36.140 --> 06:38.571
it's gonna be an extra
hundred bucks a month.

06:38.572 --> 06:41.803
Or you could use the
laundromat down the street

06:41.842 --> 06:42.947
but I don't recommend.

06:42.948 --> 06:45.613
- I'm sure, if we need to use the laundry,

06:46.560 --> 06:47.860
we can work something out.

06:49.773 --> 06:52.023
(giggling)

06:53.210 --> 06:54.306
- I'm sure we can.

06:54.307 --> 06:55.307
- We can.

06:58.968 --> 07:01.349
- She's not gonna be a problem, is she?

07:01.350 --> 07:03.149
Because, you know, I don't usually allow

07:03.150 --> 07:05.422
other people's kids here or anything.

07:05.423 --> 07:06.506
- She's fine.

07:07.951 --> 07:11.514
(water bubbling)

07:11.515 --> 07:14.265
(pleasant music)

07:46.283 --> 07:49.450
(somber violin music)

07:59.551 --> 08:00.551
- Hello?

08:01.920 --> 08:04.670
(water sloshing)

08:11.017 --> 08:12.273
Did you enjoy the show?

08:13.910 --> 08:14.910
- What show?

08:16.600 --> 08:18.633
So you guys moving in or?

08:20.926 --> 08:22.926
Are you one of my dad's whores?

08:23.270 --> 08:24.270
- Is your dad Cap?

08:26.010 --> 08:27.520
- Yep.

08:27.770 --> 08:30.573
- My mom met your dad in
a court ordered rehab.

08:31.560 --> 08:32.748
They used to fuck.

08:32.773 --> 08:34.623
We're renting a room.

08:34.669 --> 08:36.274
(chuckling)

08:36.461 --> 08:37.506
- Okay.

08:37.610 --> 08:39.097
So I guess we're housemates.

08:40.471 --> 08:41.471
Nice.

08:43.543 --> 08:45.003
By the way,

08:45.216 --> 08:46.216
nice tits.

08:47.266 --> 08:49.193
I know you love it.

08:52.864 --> 08:55.864
(somber beat music)

09:12.954 --> 09:13.954
Here you go.

09:16.952 --> 09:17.957
What?

09:17.982 --> 09:19.042
I thought this was yours.

09:19.067 --> 09:21.618
You shouldn't leave your purse
lying around, what're you doing?

09:21.643 --> 09:23.399
- Not mine.
- Not yours?

09:23.400 --> 09:25.950
Okay, let's see if there's an ID in here.

09:27.996 --> 09:30.000
And there is no ID.

09:30.001 --> 09:32.138
Just a bunch of Benjamins.

09:32.139 --> 09:34.705
(chuckling)

09:34.706 --> 09:36.849
- Can I have a sip of that?

09:36.850 --> 09:37.850
Please.

09:39.010 --> 09:41.139
- You normally take beers from strangers?

09:41.140 --> 09:42.709
- Sorry, what's your name?

09:42.734 --> 09:43.750
- Jamie.

09:43.775 --> 09:45.884
- Jamie, can I have a sip of that?

09:49.060 --> 09:50.069
- Yeah, I guess,

09:50.070 --> 09:51.729
considering I've already seen your tits

09:51.730 --> 09:53.144
and you're crashing at my pad.

09:53.261 --> 09:54.818
Yeah, why not?

09:54.843 --> 09:55.943
You a...

09:55.968 --> 09:57.082
Are you fucking kidding me?

09:57.107 --> 09:58.349
You said a sip, whoa.

09:59.901 --> 10:02.068
(sighing)

10:03.299 --> 10:06.005
(people cheering)

10:06.006 --> 10:07.006
- All right.

10:09.288 --> 10:10.488
(splashing)

10:10.489 --> 10:13.322
(people cheering)

10:14.305 --> 10:17.979
- Your fascination with my tits
isn't impressing me at all.

10:17.980 --> 10:20.019
- Jesus Christ, I'm sorry, you're hot.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.270
What am I supposed to do?

10:22.900 --> 10:25.189
And you put on a crazy show for me.

10:25.190 --> 10:28.939
I ain’t complaining but
I didn't expect that.

10:28.940 --> 10:30.309
- Didn't expect what?

10:30.310 --> 10:31.689
To come home to random some chick

10:31.690 --> 10:33.190
doing back flips in your pool?

10:34.280 --> 10:35.280
- Pretty much, yeah.

10:36.821 --> 10:38.121
- Who said it was for you?

10:38.970 --> 10:41.483
- All I'm saying is that it was hot, shit.

10:42.350 --> 10:43.350
Another beer?

10:44.445 --> 10:46.066
- Do you got anything harder?

10:46.067 --> 10:47.599
(laughing)

10:47.600 --> 10:49.063
- What do you want?

10:50.280 --> 10:52.859
- I don't know, vodka?

10:52.884 --> 10:53.884
- Vodka?

10:56.096 --> 10:57.099
Okay.

10:57.287 --> 10:58.496
Let me check.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.063
- Actually, nevermind.

11:01.617 --> 11:03.238
I'll see you later.

11:05.926 --> 11:08.926
(somber beat music)

11:16.360 --> 11:19.443
(somber piano music)

11:28.697 --> 11:30.344
- So you know what to do.

11:30.345 --> 11:33.678
He's obviously got dough, which is good.

11:35.683 --> 11:37.382
- How long should I give you?

11:37.765 --> 11:39.915
(moaning)

11:40.128 --> 11:42.119
(coughing)

11:42.120 --> 11:43.919
- If I'm not out in like three hours.

11:43.920 --> 11:44.920
- What?

11:45.686 --> 11:47.345
- Look at this neighborhood, girl.

11:47.370 --> 11:48.370
Time is money.

12:05.824 --> 12:06.657
(whistling)

12:06.658 --> 12:07.978
- Hey, sugar britches, over here.

12:08.407 --> 12:10.315
I'm gonna bring you in through the side.

12:10.340 --> 12:11.094
- Okay.

12:11.119 --> 12:13.026
- It'll be a little more discreet.
- How's yourself?

12:13.050 --> 12:14.822
- Oh, I'm fine, thanks.

12:22.520 --> 12:26.463
- You know, I'm not trying
to be an asshole or anything,

12:29.601 --> 12:31.933
but you look a little older
than I thought you'd be.

12:32.441 --> 12:34.421
I mean, your ad said 27.

12:34.971 --> 12:36.864
- Yeah, well, it's bright out here.

12:38.612 --> 12:39.905
- I guess it is.

12:40.587 --> 12:45.137
So who's the little chick
in the car with you?

12:45.246 --> 12:46.896
- My daughter.

12:46.975 --> 12:48.025
And don't ask.

12:48.050 --> 12:49.729
You couldn't afford her.

12:51.370 --> 12:52.370
- Really?

12:53.330 --> 12:54.943
Mother, daughter tag-team.

12:55.698 --> 12:56.703
I've never tried that.

12:56.704 --> 12:58.929
It sounds so freaking hot.

12:58.930 --> 13:01.280
- Yeah, well, I didn't
say we'd do it together.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.150
Woo!

13:03.175 --> 13:04.372
- Would you?

13:04.883 --> 13:05.883
- Oh.

13:08.050 --> 13:09.377
Five grand.

13:09.378 --> 13:10.474
- Is that all?

13:10.499 --> 13:11.601
Done.

13:11.626 --> 13:13.366
We'll save it for next time.

13:13.391 --> 13:17.716
Tonight I'm gonna take mommy
out for a little test drive.

13:17.741 --> 13:20.321
(giggling)

13:20.413 --> 13:21.413
- Okay.

13:24.832 --> 13:27.582
(birds chirping)

14:10.494 --> 14:13.661
(car engine rumbling)

14:16.483 --> 14:19.400
(girls chattering)

14:32.851 --> 14:34.684
- She's fucking gross.

14:46.399 --> 14:49.816
(seatbelt alarm beeping)

14:54.291 --> 14:56.208
- Put your seatbelt on.

15:21.100 --> 15:22.559
- You fucking stink.

15:22.560 --> 15:23.839
- What?

15:23.840 --> 15:25.079
You smell.

15:25.080 --> 15:28.207
Like a dirty whore who
just got her ass fucked.

15:28.208 --> 15:29.208
- Really?

15:30.085 --> 15:31.766
(tires screeching)

15:31.836 --> 15:33.091
Are you fucking kidding me?!

15:33.116 --> 15:35.104
You stupid, fucking ungrateful bitch!

15:35.105 --> 15:36.305
Fuck you!

15:36.330 --> 15:37.381
Fuck you!

15:37.382 --> 15:39.989
Once again, you fucked us
out of our living situation!

15:39.990 --> 15:42.559
Now I've gotta work double
time to pay for this shit!

15:42.560 --> 15:43.755
You think that's okay?

15:43.756 --> 15:46.329
Is that okay to you, you
stupid little bitch?!

15:46.330 --> 15:47.330
Idiot!

15:48.360 --> 15:49.593
Fuck, damn it!

15:56.093 --> 15:59.010
(Shara whimpering)

16:08.468 --> 16:10.669
(sighing)

16:10.670 --> 16:11.670
You hungry?

16:13.487 --> 16:14.919
Hello?

16:14.920 --> 16:16.066
Are you hungry?

16:16.067 --> 16:17.317
- I don't care.

16:18.223 --> 16:20.291
- Okay, you don't care.

16:20.292 --> 16:21.292
Good.

16:22.072 --> 16:24.905
- [Server] Here you go, thank you.

16:29.863 --> 16:32.863
(crickets chirping)

16:36.721 --> 16:39.629
- So you're not mad at me anymore?

16:39.630 --> 16:41.103
Don't be mad at me.

16:41.940 --> 16:42.989
You little piglet.

16:42.990 --> 16:45.021
Here, eat your fries.

16:45.022 --> 16:47.279
(laughing)

16:47.280 --> 16:49.325
Your soggy fries.

16:49.326 --> 16:50.699
- My favorite soggy fries.

16:50.700 --> 16:52.971
- I know, I got them for you.
(Shara pig snorting)

16:52.996 --> 16:55.209
(laughing)

16:55.210 --> 16:56.423
Oh my gosh.

17:00.030 --> 17:01.373
I know you don't see it,

17:03.320 --> 17:06.924
but I'm doing all this for you.

17:06.925 --> 17:08.239
- You're right.

17:08.240 --> 17:09.240
I don't see it.

17:10.858 --> 17:12.753
- Okay, feel this.

17:13.020 --> 17:14.960
Stick those fries in
your mouth and feel that.

17:14.984 --> 17:15.880
(laughing)

17:15.905 --> 17:18.233
- I know, I don't wanna gross you out.

17:18.259 --> 17:19.316
- What is that?

17:19.340 --> 17:20.300
- Feel it.

17:20.325 --> 17:21.400
- Mom, what is that?

17:21.425 --> 17:22.541
Is that a scar?

17:22.683 --> 17:23.683
- Hmm.

17:24.770 --> 17:28.199
This guy had me facedown
in a bed in a motel room

17:28.200 --> 17:29.919
with a knife like this big.

17:29.920 --> 17:31.049
Tried to cut my head off.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.311
- What?

17:32.312 --> 17:34.038
- Do you fucking blame him though?

17:34.069 --> 17:36.309
(laughing)

17:36.310 --> 17:38.285
You probably wish he did.

17:38.286 --> 17:40.536
(laughing)

17:45.230 --> 17:46.230
Seriously.

17:47.308 --> 17:48.313
Because of me,

17:48.314 --> 17:50.639
you're gonna know how
to avoid fucking sickos.

17:50.640 --> 17:54.319
You're gonna know how to
make money the right way.

17:54.320 --> 17:57.989
How to do this correctly and
not be taken advantage of.

17:57.990 --> 17:58.990
You know?

18:00.290 --> 18:02.950
I wish I had someone like
me when I first started.

18:02.989 --> 18:04.206
You're so lucky.

18:04.246 --> 18:05.995
You have no idea how lucky you are.

18:07.940 --> 18:10.213
- How come you didn't
tell me this until now?

18:11.200 --> 18:12.360
- I don't know.

18:13.570 --> 18:15.093
Up until now, why would I?

18:16.944 --> 18:19.144
It seems like you're
old enough now to know.

18:21.089 --> 18:22.167
- I guess.

18:22.168 --> 18:23.168
- Yeah.

18:23.862 --> 18:25.423
Please get this sauce out of here

18:25.448 --> 18:27.923
because if I stick my
finger in it one more time,

18:27.948 --> 18:28.967
I'm gonna kill you, okay?

18:28.968 --> 18:30.371
- Ew, I just did it.

18:30.372 --> 18:31.418
- That's disgusting.

18:31.419 --> 18:33.079
You're like a little piglet.

18:33.080 --> 18:35.330
(laughing)

18:43.526 --> 18:44.628
(gasping)

18:44.652 --> 18:45.659
- Shit.

18:45.684 --> 18:46.503
(chuckling)

18:46.528 --> 18:47.361
Watch it!

18:47.386 --> 18:49.010
- Relax, I wasn't gonna hit you, shit.

18:49.035 --> 18:49.868
- Really?

18:49.893 --> 18:50.893
- Yeah, really.

18:51.700 --> 18:53.556
Where you going?

18:53.557 --> 18:54.390
- The beach.

18:54.390 --> 18:55.390
- The beach?

18:56.098 --> 18:58.380
Do you want a ride or something or what?

19:01.411 --> 19:02.777
- Yeah.

19:02.778 --> 19:03.778
- Okay.

19:05.780 --> 19:06.780
- Be careful.

19:08.589 --> 19:09.589
- Right.

19:13.787 --> 19:17.037
(pleasant piano music)

19:49.238 --> 19:51.905
(waves rushing)

19:58.050 --> 19:59.467
It's pretty here.

20:02.345 --> 20:03.366
- I guess.

20:03.367 --> 20:05.543
I see it so much I don't
really think about it.

20:07.680 --> 20:11.000
- Have you ever thought
about walking into the ocean?

20:11.610 --> 20:13.790
Like, you start at the shore

20:15.163 --> 20:16.413
and you just keep walking

20:17.620 --> 20:19.370
until the water covers up your head

20:20.852 --> 20:21.852
and you keep going

20:23.450 --> 20:24.547
till you can't.

20:26.203 --> 20:27.553
- And then what, you drown?

20:29.680 --> 20:30.680
- You float away,

20:32.400 --> 20:33.400
to a happier place.

20:35.630 --> 20:38.033
- Yeah, I wish it was that easy.

20:38.034 --> 20:39.285
- It's that easy for you.

20:39.286 --> 20:40.689
You have a house.

20:40.690 --> 20:42.263
Your dad seems okay.

20:43.410 --> 20:45.589
- My dad's a fucking tweaker.

20:45.590 --> 20:48.363
You can't really take
everything he says too serious.

20:49.597 --> 20:51.249
- Tweaker?

20:51.250 --> 20:52.250
Like meth?

20:52.794 --> 20:53.822
- Yeah.

20:53.823 --> 20:54.823
Fucking ice.

20:55.900 --> 20:57.650
- Isn't he worried about his teeth?

20:58.681 --> 20:59.738
(chuckling)

20:59.739 --> 21:01.693
- His teeth are jacked already.

21:02.900 --> 21:04.889
Do you know how much
ice you gotta smoke

21:04.930 --> 21:06.610
for your teeth to rot out?

21:06.923 --> 21:08.103
- No..

21:08.128 --> 21:10.767
Like... every day for a year.

21:13.344 --> 21:14.923
- Do you ever do it?

21:18.570 --> 21:21.549
- I'd be lying if I
said I haven't tried it.

21:21.550 --> 21:22.800
It's not really my thing.

21:26.050 --> 21:27.759
Cap let's me do whatever the fuck I want.

21:27.760 --> 21:28.760
Fuck it.

21:30.179 --> 21:31.346
It's all good.

21:37.791 --> 21:39.041
Hey, look here.

21:39.949 --> 21:40.949
Smile.

21:43.990 --> 21:44.990
Perfect.

21:46.760 --> 21:47.960
- Let's do one together.

21:49.100 --> 21:50.100
- Okay.

21:56.403 --> 21:57.529
- Ew.

21:57.530 --> 21:58.530
That's so sick.

21:58.531 --> 22:00.719
Get away from me!

22:00.720 --> 22:01.720
Ugh!

22:02.878 --> 22:05.163
(laughing)

22:05.164 --> 22:06.608
- Oh my god, dude.

22:06.633 --> 22:07.823
- Come here.

22:07.824 --> 22:08.824
- Okay.

22:11.103 --> 22:12.103
- There.

22:13.057 --> 22:14.407
- Wow, you weren't kidding.

22:15.320 --> 22:17.570
(laughing)

22:21.923 --> 22:24.589
(coughing)

22:24.590 --> 22:25.590
- This is strong.

22:26.550 --> 22:27.749
Oh god.

22:27.750 --> 22:29.050
Where'd you get that shit?

22:30.030 --> 22:31.646
Okay, listen.

22:31.647 --> 22:36.136
"A former playmate looking for honest,

22:36.137 --> 22:40.338
"Sincere, generous gentlemen for..."

22:40.339 --> 22:41.393
- Former playmate?

22:42.790 --> 22:44.090
- Yeah, I coulda been.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.197
Whatever.

22:49.420 --> 22:50.882
Get up.

22:50.883 --> 22:52.154
- I'm trying to sleep.

22:52.208 --> 22:53.469
- [Kim] Don't fuck with me!

22:53.470 --> 22:54.470
Get up!

22:55.238 --> 22:56.238
- Shit.

22:56.920 --> 22:58.731
- [Kim] I wanna take some new pics of you.

22:58.763 --> 22:59.714
- What?

22:59.739 --> 23:00.872
- [Kim] You should have your own ad.

23:00.896 --> 23:02.062
- No way.

23:02.063 --> 23:03.621
- [Kim] Yeah way, sit up.

23:04.340 --> 23:06.399
Just take another hit, it'll relax you.

23:06.400 --> 23:07.949
Stop acting like an idiot!

23:07.950 --> 23:08.783
(camera snapping)

23:08.784 --> 23:09.870
Sit up on your knees.

23:09.909 --> 23:10.937
- I am.

23:10.962 --> 23:12.108
- [Kim] Drop the sheet.

23:14.737 --> 23:16.326
Just relax, okay?

23:16.327 --> 23:19.011
Get your hair out of your face.

23:19.670 --> 23:22.659
Give me a little, sexy smile.

23:22.660 --> 23:23.943
- Like this?

23:23.990 --> 23:24.995
(camera snapping)

23:24.996 --> 23:26.141
- Ass in the air.

23:26.142 --> 23:27.889
(camera snapping)

23:27.890 --> 23:29.429
Show me that butt.

23:29.430 --> 23:30.583
You look gorgeous.

23:32.133 --> 23:34.534
Give me the look of sex.

23:34.535 --> 23:37.368
(camera snapping)

23:48.814 --> 23:50.339
Just do what he wants, okay?

23:50.340 --> 23:53.065
He paid for an hour but
it's a 45 minute hour.

23:53.090 --> 23:54.799
I'll bang on the door when the time's up.

23:54.824 --> 23:55.920
Just stop it!

23:55.921 --> 23:57.923
Your hair looks like fucking shit.

23:58.918 --> 23:59.933
- Ow.

23:59.934 --> 24:01.643
- Just relax. Jesus.

24:03.700 --> 24:05.409
Okay, okay, listen.

24:05.410 --> 24:07.216
Let me give you the
harsh reality, all right?

24:07.217 --> 24:10.309
We've got no money, we've
got no place to stay.

24:10.310 --> 24:11.349
We got nothing.

24:11.350 --> 24:13.418
All we have is you and me.

24:13.419 --> 24:15.209
I could go in there right now

24:15.210 --> 24:17.594
and make enough money to
pay the rent for one week.

24:17.595 --> 24:20.999
You go in, you pay the
rent for two weeks, get it?

24:21.000 --> 24:22.703
All these sick fucks want young.

24:25.373 --> 24:26.828
Here.

24:26.829 --> 24:28.820
Take a hit of this.

24:28.821 --> 24:30.406
It'll relax you.

24:30.407 --> 24:31.519
Not too much.

24:31.520 --> 24:33.003
Don't wanna stink.

24:37.310 --> 24:39.079
All right, ready?

24:39.080 --> 24:40.080
Let's go.

24:41.095 --> 24:43.345
(knocking)

24:47.770 --> 24:48.770
Hi.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.059
- Hi.

24:51.060 --> 24:53.309
(giggling)

24:55.560 --> 24:56.560
- [Kim] Thanks.

25:09.930 --> 25:10.930
- Come on.

25:28.850 --> 25:29.973
Are you nervous?

25:31.050 --> 25:32.439
- Um.

25:32.440 --> 25:33.440
- Don't be.

25:34.300 --> 25:35.950
Come on, let's have a little fun.

25:36.840 --> 25:38.090
Have you ever tried blow?

25:39.820 --> 25:40.820
- Yeah.

25:42.230 --> 25:43.230
- Come here.

25:55.666 --> 25:56.666
Here.

26:07.789 --> 26:10.122
(sniffling)

26:12.323 --> 26:14.599
(laughing)

26:14.600 --> 26:15.813
You're no joke.

26:18.960 --> 26:20.433
I wanna see you dance.

26:22.200 --> 26:23.739
Will you dance for me?

26:23.740 --> 26:25.323
- There's no music.

26:29.589 --> 26:30.589
- Sing.

26:33.740 --> 26:34.740
- No way.

26:36.064 --> 26:37.673
- Hum?

26:37.674 --> 26:40.007
(laughing)

26:41.237 --> 26:43.820
(humming tune)

26:46.422 --> 26:49.005
(somber music)

27:09.905 --> 27:12.155
(laughing)

27:16.832 --> 27:18.159
(giggling)

27:18.160 --> 27:21.063
- You're kinda hot for an older guy.

27:21.064 --> 27:22.699
- Older guy?

27:22.700 --> 27:24.897
Since when did I become the older guy?

27:26.249 --> 27:27.615
Shit.

27:27.616 --> 27:29.866
(laughing)

27:32.660 --> 27:35.410
(dramatic music)

27:38.931 --> 27:40.098
Dance with me.

27:45.802 --> 27:48.552
(dramatic music)

27:55.189 --> 27:56.689
I just wanna look.

27:58.931 --> 28:01.681
(dramatic music)

28:22.505 --> 28:25.505
(crickets chirping)

28:29.772 --> 28:30.895
- Hey.

28:30.896 --> 28:32.386
- Hey.

28:32.387 --> 28:33.973
- You just get in or?

28:35.021 --> 28:36.071
- A little while ago.

28:39.133 --> 28:40.466
- I'm exhausted.

28:42.620 --> 28:43.620
Wanna?

28:44.357 --> 28:45.357
- I'm good.

28:49.610 --> 28:51.513
- Oh, I almost forgot, shit.

28:53.146 --> 28:54.293
I got this for you.

28:57.380 --> 28:58.380
- Thanks.

28:59.500 --> 29:00.500
- Yeah.

29:04.972 --> 29:07.921
- Why are you being so nice to me?

29:07.922 --> 29:09.513
- You're so fucking cool.

29:12.440 --> 29:13.453
You get me.

29:15.880 --> 29:16.913
You don't judge me.

29:18.760 --> 29:21.210
You're so different from
everybody else I've met.

29:22.992 --> 29:25.592
I don't know, most girls
in Venice are just bitches.

29:28.210 --> 29:29.910
- How do you know I'm not a bitch?

29:31.170 --> 29:32.529
- Are you?

29:32.530 --> 29:34.079
- Sometimes.

29:34.080 --> 29:35.080
If you're a dick.

29:36.970 --> 29:37.970
- Never.

29:38.660 --> 29:42.139
- Yeah, that's what they all say.

29:42.140 --> 29:43.140
- Okay.

29:43.880 --> 29:44.880
That's kinda harsh.

29:46.880 --> 29:47.880
- It's just,

29:48.800 --> 29:50.539
I've seen my mom get fucked over

29:50.540 --> 29:53.899
like a thousand times by guys

29:53.900 --> 29:55.753
and it's getting old.

29:57.630 --> 29:59.405
- Maybe it's a problem.

29:59.406 --> 30:02.393
She's kinda rough, no offense.

30:03.890 --> 30:04.940
- It's not her fault.

30:06.530 --> 30:08.173
She's just totally fucked up.

30:12.270 --> 30:13.659
- Obviously.

30:13.660 --> 30:14.660
- Seriously.

30:17.740 --> 30:20.035
My mom never had a family.

30:20.036 --> 30:22.733
She started stripping at 18.

30:23.670 --> 30:26.020
She had nothing and she
had to take care of me.

30:27.930 --> 30:29.530
She could've easily given me up.

30:30.720 --> 30:31.720
So,

30:33.220 --> 30:34.543
considering all that,

30:35.910 --> 30:37.303
she's done pretty okay.

30:40.074 --> 30:43.062
- I really don't get
why you keep doing this.

30:43.063 --> 30:44.289
- Doing what?

30:44.290 --> 30:46.289
- Like defending her.

30:46.290 --> 30:48.003
- All we have is each other.

30:51.260 --> 30:52.603
Thanks for thinking of me.

30:56.038 --> 30:57.038
- Everyday.

31:06.063 --> 31:07.071
Fuck.

31:07.096 --> 31:08.046
Whoa.

31:08.046 --> 31:09.029
(giggling)

31:09.054 --> 31:10.054
All right.

31:11.350 --> 31:13.092
- You want another show?

31:13.093 --> 31:14.867
- Whoa, what're you doing?

31:14.868 --> 31:15.868
- What?

31:19.849 --> 31:20.932
- Look at me.

31:23.690 --> 31:24.803
I really like you.

31:28.370 --> 31:29.893
- Did I do something wrong?

31:31.790 --> 31:32.790
I'm sorry.

31:35.456 --> 31:36.456
- Listen.

31:37.563 --> 31:40.146
(somber music)

32:27.997 --> 32:31.539
(Shara giggling)

32:31.540 --> 32:32.563
- You ever try ice?

32:33.480 --> 32:34.480
- I smoke weed.

32:35.640 --> 32:36.640
- Wanna try some?

32:38.289 --> 32:39.122
There you go.

32:39.147 --> 32:40.102
- Whoa, whoa.

32:40.127 --> 32:40.988
What're you doing?

32:40.988 --> 32:41.821
What about your teeth?

32:41.821 --> 32:42.821
- I'm just trying it.

32:43.599 --> 32:45.255
- Let me do it for you then.

32:45.280 --> 32:46.280
Shit.

32:57.663 --> 32:59.913
(coughing)

33:01.443 --> 33:02.610
You all right?

33:04.342 --> 33:05.342
- Yeah.

33:08.288 --> 33:09.739
- Oh hell yeah.

33:09.740 --> 33:11.199
Get it boy.

33:11.200 --> 33:12.749
God, that shit turns bitches on.

33:12.750 --> 33:14.354
I love it.

33:14.355 --> 33:15.605
This is better than porn.

33:17.049 --> 33:18.772
(giggling)

33:18.773 --> 33:21.690
(shower trickling)

33:37.821 --> 33:38.880
- Sorry.

33:38.881 --> 33:40.880
I'll be out in a minute.

kitchen and the laundry.

35:07.285 --> 35:08.377
- What?

35:08.402 --> 35:09.343

Let's go.

Come on, baby, let's go, let's go.

35:36.014 --> 35:38.681
(ominous music)

35:58.866 --> 36:00.104
Cap has a stash.

36:00.105 --> 36:01.605
Well, had a stash.

36:03.310 --> 36:05.793
Fuck, it's only 260 bucks.

36:08.547 --> 36:11.999
I need a drink or ice or
something to get this edge off.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.826
Baby, you want something?

36:13.827 --> 36:15.077
- I don't care.

36:19.855 --> 36:22.766
- Everything's going
to be okay, all right?

36:22.767 --> 36:25.256
Don't worry about it.

36:25.257 --> 36:26.840
I'll be right back.

(water trickling)

37:23.747 --> 37:24.926
Yo, babe, where you at?

37:24.927 --> 37:27.214
- [Shara] Just a minute.

37:27.215 --> 37:28.215
- Okay.

37:44.351 --> 37:45.859
What're you, on the rag?

37:45.860 --> 37:46.860
- Huh?

37:47.741 --> 37:48.824
I don't know.

37:50.890 --> 37:53.065
- Did he do that to you?

37:53.066 --> 37:54.233
- He didn't touch me.

38:00.257 --> 38:02.924
(waves rushing)

38:04.292 --> 38:07.650
(seagulls squawking)

38:07.651 --> 38:10.307
I can't believe we're on our own.

38:10.308 --> 38:11.508
What're we gonna do now?

38:12.389 --> 38:13.389
- About what?

38:15.327 --> 38:17.309
- We kinda blew all the money already

38:17.310 --> 38:19.727
and I'm worried about you getting caught.

38:21.409 --> 38:22.490
- Don't worry about it, Hun.

38:22.491 --> 38:23.863
I got a plan.

38:24.840 --> 38:25.840
- What?

38:28.020 --> 38:30.039
- Sweetheart, we're not going back, okay?

38:30.040 --> 38:32.249
We're moving forward and
everything's gonna be okay.

38:32.250 --> 38:33.862
No more bullshit, you hear me?

38:33.863 --> 38:35.545
- Okay.

38:35.546 --> 38:38.713
(exciting beat music)

38:47.855 --> 38:49.855
- What's happening, man?

38:50.649 --> 38:51.619
My man!

38:51.644 --> 38:52.621
- What's happening?

38:52.621 --> 38:53.454
- How you been?

38:53.455 --> 38:54.484
- Word.

38:54.485 --> 38:55.318
You ready?

38:55.318 --> 38:56.151
- Yeah.

38:56.152 --> 38:57.318
- Let's do it.

38:59.688 --> 39:02.438
(exciting music)

39:04.375 --> 39:05.375
- Jill.

39:10.550 --> 39:11.383
- Hi.

39:11.383 --> 39:12.383
- Hi.

39:13.042 --> 39:14.469
- Can you get this one suited up?

39:14.470 --> 39:15.470
- Sure.

39:21.208 --> 39:22.689
- How is Cap?

39:22.690 --> 39:23.690
- Fucked up.

39:28.050 --> 39:29.753
- Kristi will take over from here.

39:33.760 --> 39:35.510
- Well hello, Kristi.

39:38.102 --> 39:40.519
(beat music)

39:48.894 --> 39:49.943
(bottle clinking)

39:49.944 --> 39:51.861
Yo, these just came in.

39:52.932 --> 39:54.349
- Leave it there.

40:05.205 --> 40:07.955
(dramatic music)

40:23.034 --> 40:25.451
- God, you're so fucking hot.

40:27.057 --> 40:28.890
You like staying here?

40:31.565 --> 40:34.783
- It just needs some flowers,
then it'll be perfect.

40:34.784 --> 40:36.867
Like our own little home.

40:39.202 --> 40:40.285
- You got it.

40:41.897 --> 40:43.263
Tomorrow.

40:43.264 --> 40:44.264
Flowers.

40:48.359 --> 40:49.359
- Daisies.

40:50.811 --> 40:51.811
- Daisies?

40:54.834 --> 40:57.501
(sensual music)

41:44.109 --> 41:46.859
(sexual moaning)

41:58.456 --> 42:00.873
(beat music)

42:02.390 --> 42:03.390
- There she is.

42:04.360 --> 42:06.041
Miss America.

42:06.042 --> 42:07.689
(laughing)

42:07.690 --> 42:09.789
- Hey, my friend's talking
to you, Miss America,

42:09.790 --> 42:10.913
don't be rude!

42:10.938 --> 42:11.613
- Ow.

42:11.614 --> 42:13.193
- Bet you got a virgin ass, hooker.

42:13.194 --> 42:14.277
- Get off me!

42:15.761 --> 42:17.549
If I'm a hooker than you owe me this.

42:17.550 --> 42:18.550
- The hell I do!

42:19.350 --> 42:20.449
Give it back!

42:20.450 --> 42:22.836
- Back the fuck off of me!

42:22.837 --> 42:23.670
Pervert!

42:23.670 --> 42:24.520
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

42:24.521 --> 42:26.118
- This little bitch just stole my money.

42:26.119 --> 42:26.952
- Hey, asshole!

42:26.952 --> 42:27.817
- Check her tits! Check her tits!

42:27.818 --> 42:29.354
She's got 250 in there.

42:29.355 --> 42:30.438
- Stupid ass!

42:31.552 --> 42:32.552
- Come on.

42:35.460 --> 42:37.877
(whimpering)

42:41.769 --> 42:43.936
(yelling)

42:47.005 --> 42:49.922
(glass shattering)

43:00.095 --> 43:02.178
(crying)

43:12.350 --> 43:14.119
- What the fuck happened tonight?

43:14.120 --> 43:15.739
Did you rip some guy off or what?

43:15.740 --> 43:18.503
- He stuck his finger up my
ass and he called me a hooker.

43:18.528 --> 43:20.174
- Maybe you shouldn't be wearing a skirt

43:20.199 --> 43:22.659
with your fucking ass hanging out of it.

43:22.660 --> 43:25.189
- I could be walking around naked.

43:25.190 --> 43:29.009
That doesn't give him or anyone
the right to do that to me.

43:29.010 --> 43:31.099
- Spoken like a true fucking
whore, congratulations.

43:31.100 --> 43:32.879
Did your mom teach you that bullshit?

43:32.880 --> 43:36.323
- My mom taught me not to
give anything away for free!

43:37.880 --> 43:40.521
So no, I didn't steal anyone's money.

43:40.546 --> 43:41.683
He owed me.

43:41.684 --> 43:43.006
- So you Ar a whore?

43:43.031 --> 43:44.018
I knew it.

43:44.043 --> 43:45.007
I fucking knew it.

43:45.008 --> 43:46.809
- You don't have any idea.

43:46.810 --> 43:48.089
- I have no idea?

43:48.090 --> 43:49.389
I have a fucking idea, babe.

43:49.390 --> 43:51.019
I saw those sick fucking pictures of you

43:51.020 --> 43:52.707
on your mom's computer.

43:52.708 --> 43:53.929
- What?

43:53.930 --> 43:55.669
You were creeping on her computer?

43:55.670 --> 43:56.914
What the fuck is wrong with you?

43:56.915 --> 43:57.748
- What's wrong with me?

43:57.748 --> 43:58.581
You're the fucking whore!

43:58.582 --> 44:02.259
- My mom made me take those pictures.

44:02.260 --> 44:04.119
- She made you take those pictures.

44:04.120 --> 44:06.349
She made you stick your ass in there

44:06.350 --> 44:08.622
and make those stupid
duck lips at the camera?

44:08.623 --> 44:10.913
What, are you fucking joking me right now?

44:12.890 --> 44:14.609
Maybe you should just go back to whoring.

44:14.610 --> 44:16.389
It seems to work best for you.

44:16.390 --> 44:17.993
- Fuck you!

44:18.886 --> 44:20.219
Fuck you!

44:20.220 --> 44:21.137
- Oh, fuck me?

44:21.137 --> 44:21.970
- Fuck you!

44:21.970 --> 44:22.909
- Fuck me?!

44:22.909 --> 44:23.909
Huh?!

44:24.780 --> 44:27.319
Why don't you just go
fucking cut yourself, baby?!

44:27.320 --> 44:28.153
Don't think I haven't noticed

44:28.154 --> 44:30.029
this fucking bullshit on your leg!

44:30.030 --> 44:32.333
You fucking psychopath
motherfucking bitch!

44:33.497 --> 44:35.194
(crying)

44:35.195 --> 44:36.963
- How could you say that to me?

44:47.230 --> 44:49.439
- I can't believe,

44:49.440 --> 44:52.589
I can't even fucking believe
I thought I loved you.

44:52.590 --> 44:54.673
(crying)

44:57.685 --> 44:58.785
- Where are you going?

45:04.490 --> 45:05.713
Please don't go.

45:07.047 --> 45:08.047
I'm sorry.

45:11.675 --> 45:12.675
I'm sorry.

45:13.578 --> 45:14.578
I'm sorry.

45:16.444 --> 45:17.444
- No.

45:18.155 --> 45:22.855
- Please.
(sobbing)

45:23.915 --> 45:26.328
Please don't leave me.

45:26.329 --> 45:27.859
Please.

45:27.860 --> 45:30.987
- Get the fuck away from me, you slut.

45:34.431 --> 45:36.514
(crying)

45:39.207 --> 45:41.374
(yelling)

45:42.451 --> 45:45.118
(ominous music)

45:47.751 --> 45:48.751
- Fuck!

46:01.051 --> 46:03.301
(coughing)

46:11.961 --> 46:14.211
(thudding)

46:15.371 --> 46:18.121
(dramatic music)

46:43.602 --> 46:45.769
(huffing)

46:56.756 --> 46:57.859
(groaning)

46:57.860 --> 46:58.860
Fuck!

47:00.976 --> 47:03.299
(thudding)

47:03.300 --> 47:05.956
(speaking foreign language)

47:05.957 --> 47:08.124
(yelling)

47:09.843 --> 47:12.175
- Shut the fuck up, bitch!

47:12.176 --> 47:13.210
Shut the fuck up!

47:13.211 --> 47:15.919
(women whimpering)

47:16.083 --> 47:17.808
What the fuck are you talking about?!

47:17.833 --> 47:19.179
Shut up, bitch!

47:19.180 --> 47:21.602
Don't say another motherfucking word!

47:21.627 --> 47:22.568
- Please, just--

47:22.593 --> 47:23.590
- Shut up!

47:23.615 --> 47:24.977
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, okay?

47:25.001 --> 47:26.221
- Shut up, bitch!

47:26.246 --> 47:27.649
(smacking)

47:27.650 --> 47:28.939
- [Woman] God!

47:28.940 --> 47:30.395
- [Man] Shut the fuck up!

47:30.396 --> 47:32.063
- [Woman] I'm sorry.

47:34.965 --> 47:37.582
- [Man] Don't tell me what to do!

47:37.583 --> 47:39.779
- [Woman] I'm sorry.

47:39.780 --> 47:41.113
- [Man] Shut up!

47:44.020 --> 47:46.520
(dog barking)

47:49.920 --> 47:52.670
(birds chirping)

48:08.990 --> 48:10.519
- You got the money for last night?

48:10.520 --> 48:12.379
Your boyfriend said he would pay today.

48:12.380 --> 48:14.594
I can't keep letting you without pay.

48:14.595 --> 48:16.569
- Yeah, I'm gonna go meet him right now.

48:16.570 --> 48:17.636
He has it.

48:17.637 --> 48:19.759
- Get it to me by 5PM.

48:19.760 --> 48:21.196
If not, you're out!

48:21.197 --> 48:22.197
- Okay.

48:37.981 --> 48:40.231
(giggling)

48:47.879 --> 48:50.629
(dramatic music)

49:11.890 --> 49:12.890
- Hey.

49:13.890 --> 49:14.890
You okay?

49:16.119 --> 49:17.579
- [Shara] Yeah.

49:17.580 --> 49:18.580
- Hop in.

49:22.670 --> 49:24.220
You're all right, I won't bite.

49:31.309 --> 49:32.744
What are you doing walking around

49:32.769 --> 49:34.300
in a neighborhood like this
in the middle of the night?

49:34.324 --> 49:35.898
You know how dangerous that is?

49:36.440 --> 49:37.899
- Yeah.

49:37.900 --> 49:40.303
- You're lucky you found
me and not some lunatic.

49:46.839 --> 49:48.830
Will that help?

49:48.831 --> 49:50.331
- Yeah, thank you.

49:51.819 --> 49:52.819
Thank you.

49:55.743 --> 49:57.433
- All right, let's do this.

50:01.360 --> 50:02.693
- I didn't know.

50:04.520 --> 50:06.559
- Hooker school 101,

50:06.560 --> 50:09.379
you negotiate before you get in the car.

50:09.380 --> 50:11.723
Don't tell me you're standing
here for your health.

50:16.060 --> 50:17.899
You wanna make the 20 bucks or not?

50:17.900 --> 50:21.787
If you don't you can give
it back and you can get out.

50:32.930 --> 50:34.257
- Okay, okay.

50:34.258 --> 50:35.675
- That's my girl.

50:36.710 --> 50:39.460
(dramatic music)

50:49.500 --> 50:52.000
(man yelling)

50:54.009 --> 50:56.259
(coughing)

51:09.635 --> 51:12.385
(dramatic music)

52:11.593 --> 52:14.343
(birds chirping)

52:18.418 --> 52:21.168
(metal clanking)

52:29.861 --> 52:32.632
(chuckling)

52:32.633 --> 52:34.133
- [Cap] Douchebag.

52:36.597 --> 52:39.597
(riders chattering)

52:54.611 --> 52:56.861
(knocking)

53:13.952 --> 53:16.202
(groaning)

53:25.488 --> 53:27.655
(sighing)

53:35.042 --> 53:37.792
(birds chirping)

53:48.626 --> 53:49.626
- Yo!

53:50.619 --> 53:51.619
- Ow.

53:52.777 --> 53:54.653
- What the hell are you
doing in my backyard?

53:54.654 --> 53:56.186
- Hi.

53:56.187 --> 53:57.187
Sorry.

53:57.741 --> 53:58.793
How are you?

53:58.794 --> 54:00.139
- How am I? I'm fucking fabulous.

54:00.140 --> 54:01.170
What're you doing here?

54:01.195 --> 54:02.195
- Well,

54:03.550 --> 54:06.023
remember when you offered
me a hundred dollars?

54:08.460 --> 54:09.460
- Yeah.

54:11.233 --> 54:12.440
- I was just wondering

54:12.441 --> 54:14.640
how much you'd offer
me for the whole thing.

54:19.001 --> 54:20.473
- What is it you need?

54:22.015 --> 54:23.907
- A place to stay for awhile.

54:32.960 --> 54:34.913
(groaning)

54:34.914 --> 54:37.685
- Tell me what a fucking slut you are!

54:37.686 --> 54:40.103
(whimpering)

54:59.274 --> 55:01.099
Can I offer you a cocktail?

55:01.100 --> 55:02.100
- Thanks.

55:06.390 --> 55:07.897
- What're you on?

55:08.780 --> 55:11.914
Instagram or Twitter
or some shit like that?

55:11.915 --> 55:12.915
- Mhmm.

55:16.385 --> 55:17.385
- So...

55:18.530 --> 55:19.530
How's your mom?

55:21.438 --> 55:22.879
Not that I actually give a shit.

55:22.880 --> 55:24.663
I just thought I'd be nice.

55:25.926 --> 55:26.962
You know,

55:26.963 --> 55:27.963
the only reason

55:28.690 --> 55:30.640
I let you and your mom stay here before

55:32.056 --> 55:33.056
was because of you.

55:34.780 --> 55:37.773
I really feel like we have a connection.

55:39.260 --> 55:40.260
Age

55:41.730 --> 55:43.099
shouldn't matter,

55:43.100 --> 55:44.100
you know?

55:45.200 --> 55:48.193
Age is just a number.

55:51.435 --> 55:54.953
That thing that happened
between me and your mom.

55:56.320 --> 55:57.320
Stupid fight.

55:59.750 --> 56:00.750
Your mom,

56:02.130 --> 56:03.409
she pushed me there, you know?

56:03.410 --> 56:04.563
You know how she is.

56:06.110 --> 56:07.260
Really wasn't my fault.

56:10.250 --> 56:11.250
Anyway.

56:13.120 --> 56:14.120
Glad you're here.

56:21.550 --> 56:23.777
Nice of me to let you stay here, huh?

56:36.020 --> 56:37.643
God, you are perfect.

56:51.591 --> 56:53.758
(sighing)

57:22.029 --> 57:23.029
Suck it.

57:34.170 --> 57:36.420
(coughing)

57:37.273 --> 57:39.316
(chuckling)

57:39.317 --> 57:42.317
Goddamn, you're a sexy little bitch.

57:45.574 --> 57:48.241
(ominous music)

58:31.482 --> 58:32.619
- Hi.

58:32.620 --> 58:33.620
- Yeah?

58:34.136 --> 58:35.782
- I'm here about the job.

58:35.807 --> 58:38.007
- You're the girl I talked
on the phone earlier.

58:38.032 --> 58:40.053
- Mhmm.
- Yeah.

58:40.713 --> 58:41.860
Yeah, follow me.

58:50.162 --> 58:51.162
- I'm 18,

58:52.130 --> 58:54.087
five, two.

58:54.088 --> 58:56.163
Long dark hair.

58:57.210 --> 58:58.210
B-cup.

58:59.550 --> 59:01.126
What do you say, baby?

59:01.127 --> 59:02.403
You wanna come by?

59:03.580 --> 59:06.209
I have a girlfriend here too.

59:06.210 --> 59:08.010
If you want to play with both of is.

59:09.540 --> 59:10.793
- Come, come in.

59:12.550 --> 59:13.550
Don't be scared.

59:14.488 --> 59:15.654
Come closer.

59:15.757 --> 59:16.910
(chuckling)

59:16.911 --> 59:18.163
What are you? Runaway?

59:19.880 --> 59:23.573
Am I going to see your face
on a milk carton anytime soon?

59:25.250 --> 59:26.599
- No.

59:26.600 --> 59:29.163
My parents are dead, so
you don't have to worry.

59:30.520 --> 59:33.273
- Are you aware of what exactly this is?

59:33.864 --> 59:35.120
- I've done it before.

59:35.121 --> 59:37.249
- What have you done before?

59:37.250 --> 59:40.722
- Like, with guys and stuff for money.

59:40.723 --> 59:44.390
(speaking foreign language)

59:47.977 --> 59:51.199
- I have a very rich clientele.

59:51.200 --> 59:52.659
VIP.

59:52.660 --> 59:55.039
VIP only.

59:55.040 --> 59:59.259
That means famous actors,
Hollywood producers,

59:59.260 --> 01:00:00.333
business men.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:04.259
Very, very important people.

01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:05.260
Got it?

01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:10.116
You get a thousand dollars an hour

01:00:10.117 --> 01:00:12.139
and I'll keep 40 percent.

01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:14.889
And this is the best deal you can find.

01:00:14.890 --> 01:00:16.419
Trust me.

01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:19.589
Most people take 60, 70 percent

01:00:19.590 --> 01:00:21.173
and some take it all.

01:00:22.813 --> 01:00:24.982
So what are you willing to do?

01:00:25.007 --> 01:00:26.030
- I don't know.

01:00:26.031 --> 01:00:30.259
- Can you do girls on girls,
double penetration, anal?

01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:33.543
Any specific fetishes?

01:00:35.690 --> 01:00:38.578
I have this client, he gets off on

01:00:38.579 --> 01:00:40.979
sexual necrophilia.

01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:43.939
(laughing)

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:45.343
Most girls love it.

01:00:46.217 --> 01:00:48.259
You have to pretend you enjoy yourself.

01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:49.563
Just pretend you're dead.

01:00:50.550 --> 01:00:51.550
Very easy.

01:00:52.622 --> 01:00:53.713
You can do it, right?

01:00:53.714 --> 01:00:55.199
- Mhmm.

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:58.529
- Are you okay with C.O.F., B.B.B.J?

01:00:58.530 --> 01:00:59.958
- Sorry?

01:00:59.959 --> 01:01:01.873
(laughing)

01:01:01.874 --> 01:01:05.096
(speaking foreign language)

01:01:05.097 --> 01:01:08.359
- "C.O.F." is "cum on face."

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:11.577
And "B.B.B.J." is "bareback blowjob."

01:01:13.050 --> 01:01:14.050
- Okay?

01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:15.657
- Mhmm.

01:01:15.658 --> 01:01:16.889
- Oh my god.

01:01:16.890 --> 01:01:18.950
Okay, just go with Sero.

01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:21.600
I'll talk to you later.

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:30.680
- Sit with them.

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:38.469
- Hey.

01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:39.519
- Hi.

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:41.079
- You'll learn to check up.

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:42.933
It'll seem like nothing.

01:01:42.934 --> 01:01:45.184
(knocking)

01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:57.623
- I'll take her.

01:02:05.237 --> 01:02:07.056
- How old was that girl?

01:02:07.119 --> 01:02:08.235
- I don't know.

01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:09.455
- Come on.

01:02:09.456 --> 01:02:14.342
Let me take some pictures of you.

01:02:14.343 --> 01:02:18.999
(Sero speaking foreign language)

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.179
I can text some clients.

01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:23.078
They'll want to come to see you.

01:02:23.079 --> 01:02:25.645
(speaking foreign language)

01:02:25.646 --> 01:02:28.249
(camera snapping)

01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:29.250
Hi.

01:02:29.970 --> 01:02:32.869
You should be a professional model.

01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:33.870
Oh my God.

01:02:37.810 --> 01:02:38.810
Come on, honey.

01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:40.630
Get in the picture.

01:02:41.866 --> 01:02:45.533
(speaking foreign language)

01:02:51.367 --> 01:02:52.867
Oh my, incredible.

01:02:54.905 --> 01:02:55.905
You like snow?

01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:02.543
Makes you feel sexy, huh?

01:03:18.033 --> 01:03:19.179
(thudding)

01:03:19.204 --> 01:03:21.872
- What the fuck do you think
you're doing, you little asshole?!

01:03:22.495 --> 01:03:23.578
Huh?

01:03:23.579 --> 01:03:24.709
(thudding)

01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:26.269
Get up, you little fucking bitch!

01:03:26.270 --> 01:03:27.508
You little punk ass!

01:03:27.509 --> 01:03:29.002
I'll fucking murder...

01:03:29.003 --> 01:03:30.019
(groaning)

01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:31.907
- I fucking hate you, man!

01:03:31.932 --> 01:03:32.994
Fuck!

01:03:33.019 --> 01:03:34.086
(groaning)

01:03:34.111 --> 01:03:35.286
- Little fucking cunt.

01:03:35.287 --> 01:03:37.287
You little motherfucker.

01:03:48.833 --> 01:03:51.666
(engine starting)

01:03:53.264 --> 01:03:55.307
Come back here, you little motherfucker!

01:03:55.308 --> 01:03:57.184
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

01:03:57.185 --> 01:03:58.563
You son-of-a-bitch!

01:04:04.450 --> 01:04:05.450
- You want some?

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:07.160
- Sure.

01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:17.889
- Safety first.

01:04:17.890 --> 01:04:18.890
- For sure.

01:04:21.690 --> 01:04:23.440
- You ever been with a girl before?

01:04:25.630 --> 01:04:27.059
- No.

01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:28.159
- It's no biggie.

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:30.129
I mean, everything's basically the same,

01:04:30.130 --> 01:04:31.130
just softer.

01:04:33.558 --> 01:04:34.558
- Okay.

01:04:37.798 --> 01:04:39.989
How long have you been working here?

01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:41.109
- Like three months.

01:04:41.155 --> 01:04:42.210
It's pretty good.

01:04:42.211 --> 01:04:44.735
Plus, I wanna get into porn
and this is better for that.

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:45.820
- It is?

01:04:45.821 --> 01:04:48.553
- Yeah, your price goes up
when you become a porn star.

01:04:50.735 --> 01:04:52.049
- What do you mean?

01:04:52.050 --> 01:04:54.679
- I mean, guys are willing to pay more

01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:56.599
if they've seen your movies.

01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:58.609
I met an agent the other
day and he's gonna help me

01:04:58.610 --> 01:05:00.049
get into the industry.

01:05:00.050 --> 01:05:02.139
We took a bunch of photos
and he's gonna send them

01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:04.099
to some big time porn producers.

01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:05.509
I'm excited.

01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:06.583
- That's really cool.

01:05:07.504 --> 01:05:09.199
(knocking)

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:10.200
- Follow my lead.

01:05:18.197 --> 01:05:19.219
Hi.

01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:20.220
- Hi.

01:05:26.814 --> 01:05:28.709
If you'd like to take a shower first,

01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:30.110
you're more than welcome to.

01:05:31.787 --> 01:05:32.787
- Will you join me?

01:05:34.073 --> 01:05:38.744
♪ I turn my sexy on ♪

01:05:38.745 --> 01:05:43.150

- I heard you were great.

01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:00.003
Such a good worker.

01:06:01.210 --> 01:06:02.373
Such a beauty.

01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:05.380
I'm very happy to have you here.

01:06:06.586 --> 01:06:08.753
(sighing)

01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:13.979
- Um.

01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:16.253
- You owe Sero for drugs, honey.

01:06:17.170 --> 01:06:18.523
I took it out of your pay.

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:21.089
- What that fuck?

01:06:21.090 --> 01:06:22.719
- You think it's free?

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:23.869
Come on.

01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:25.120
- Thanks for the warning.

01:06:28.065 --> 01:06:29.893
- Only because I like you.

01:06:32.458 --> 01:06:34.689
Come back tomorrow, honey.

01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:36.949
You're gonna make twice more money.

01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:39.003
Maybe three times with your beauty.

01:06:41.070 --> 01:06:42.070
Oh.

01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:46.289
Honey, you're gonna make lots of money.

01:06:46.290 --> 01:06:47.483
I promise you.

01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:49.973
Okay? Chop, chop.

01:06:55.561 --> 01:06:58.561
(crickets chirping)

01:07:21.763 --> 01:07:22.763
- Shara!

01:07:25.544 --> 01:07:28.219
Have you been smoking
this shit in my house?

01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:29.523
- It's just water vapor.

01:07:30.563 --> 01:07:32.713
- Disrespectful fucking little cunt!

01:07:33.934 --> 01:07:36.705
You gonna get blood on my fucking
furniture, I swear to God!

01:07:36.706 --> 01:07:37.968
(whimpering) Get up!

01:07:37.993 --> 01:07:40.402
Fucking little bitch! You're
worse than your fucking mom!

01:07:40.427 --> 01:07:41.431
- [Shara] No!

01:07:41.456 --> 01:07:42.643
- Shut the fuck up!

01:07:42.698 --> 01:07:44.844
Shut the fuck up! (screaming)
Shut the fuck up!

01:07:44.869 --> 01:07:47.027
(yelling)

01:07:47.028 --> 01:07:49.887
(muffled screaming)

01:07:49.888 --> 01:07:52.221
(screaming)

01:07:53.669 --> 01:07:55.136
(gasping)

01:07:55.137 --> 01:07:56.298
(crying)

01:07:56.299 --> 01:07:57.703
What? What? What? What?

01:07:57.704 --> 01:08:01.024
(muffled screaming)

01:08:01.025 --> 01:08:03.275
(gurgling)

01:08:12.136 --> 01:08:14.386
(coughing)

01:08:20.233 --> 01:08:21.233
- Hey.

01:08:22.439 --> 01:08:24.823
- Can I stay with you for a few days?

01:08:29.082 --> 01:08:31.166
(crying)

01:08:55.710 --> 01:08:56.710
- Look.

01:08:59.479 --> 01:09:00.849
- That's your parents?

01:09:00.850 --> 01:09:02.198
- Yeah.

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:03.500
We don't talk much though.

01:09:05.270 --> 01:09:07.399
- I don't even know who my dad is.

01:09:07.399 --> 01:09:08.500
- Maybe that's better.

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:10.618
- You think?

01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:13.099
- Yeah, I mean, what if he's a jerk?

01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:14.100
- I guess.

01:09:15.773 --> 01:09:17.519
- Those are the pictures
my agent took of me

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:19.109
to get into porn.

01:09:19.109 --> 01:09:20.612
What do you think?

01:09:20.613 --> 01:09:22.357
- I think you're beautiful.

01:09:25.435 --> 01:09:26.435
Aren't you scared?

01:09:27.337 --> 01:09:28.805
- Of what?

01:09:28.805 --> 01:09:29.805
- You know,

01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:32.019
of never getting out.

01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:35.305
- When I turn 30, I'm
gonna stop doing this.

01:09:35.307 --> 01:09:38.038
I'm gonna get married and be a housewife.

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:39.953
Have lots of kids and pets.

01:09:43.404 --> 01:09:44.404
I can't wait.

01:10:06.705 --> 01:10:08.599
(phone ringing)

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:09.600
- Hello?

01:10:10.810 --> 01:10:12.759
- Yeah, I'm calling about your ad.

01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:14.610
- You wanna come by and play with me?

01:10:15.890 --> 01:10:18.319
- I'm calling about the
girl in the pink dress.

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:20.075
- You're talking to her, sweetie.

01:10:20.076 --> 01:10:21.774
- Okay, whatever.

01:10:21.775 --> 01:10:24.711
Just let me know where you're at.

01:10:24.712 --> 01:10:25.712
Okay.

01:10:28.353 --> 01:10:29.393
Fucking bitch.

01:10:34.468 --> 01:10:35.473
- How are you?

01:10:35.474 --> 01:10:37.133
- Good, how are you?

01:10:41.014 --> 01:10:43.764
(city commotion)

01:10:45.429 --> 01:10:46.581
- Have a nice day.

01:10:46.582 --> 01:10:47.582
- You too.

01:11:05.074 --> 01:11:06.230
- Why, what's going on?

01:11:06.231 --> 01:11:07.243
- Can I talk to you?

01:11:08.350 --> 01:11:09.500
- Let me call you back.

01:11:10.652 --> 01:11:13.402
(city commotion)

01:11:20.526 --> 01:11:21.705
- Where did those come from?

01:11:21.706 --> 01:11:24.069
- He said you would know.

01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:25.239
- How'd he find me?

01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:26.443
- I don't know.

01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:29.340
- I don't want them.

01:11:31.374 --> 01:11:33.979
You can have them or
you can throw them out.

01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:34.980
- Really?

01:11:36.090 --> 01:11:37.090
- Really.

01:11:38.309 --> 01:11:41.309
(somber beat music)

01:11:43.490 --> 01:11:45.319
- Bring all the tips to me.

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:46.370
I'll hold everything.

01:11:47.210 --> 01:11:49.149
If you they want extra, let me know.

01:11:49.150 --> 01:11:50.726
I'll give you the price.

01:11:50.727 --> 01:11:52.977
(giggling)

01:11:54.201 --> 01:11:56.231
(exciting beat music)

01:11:56.232 --> 01:11:58.815
(men cheering)

01:12:10.638 --> 01:12:12.054
- Yes!

01:12:12.055 --> 01:12:13.055
Yes!

01:12:13.958 --> 01:12:16.541
(men cheering)

01:12:17.432 --> 01:12:20.599
(exciting beat music)

01:12:26.467 --> 01:12:27.884
- [Man] Oh, fuck!

01:12:29.915 --> 01:12:31.165
Smack that ass!

01:12:32.622 --> 01:12:35.205
(men cheering)

01:12:45.739 --> 01:12:48.906
(exciting beat music)

01:13:17.035 --> 01:13:19.785
(city commotion)

01:13:23.871 --> 01:13:25.870
(giggling)

01:13:25.895 --> 01:13:27.409
- And then the groom wanted me

01:13:27.410 --> 01:13:29.703
to stick liquorice up his butt.

01:13:31.030 --> 01:13:32.339
- That is so sick.

01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:33.749
- Ew.

01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:34.936
- Ugh.

01:13:34.937 --> 01:13:36.169
Did you do it?

01:13:36.170 --> 01:13:37.809
- I tried.

01:13:37.810 --> 01:13:40.459
It was like sticking a
wet noodle up a cat's ass.

01:13:40.484 --> 01:13:42.397
- Not happening.
- Okay.

01:13:42.422 --> 01:13:43.560
- Girls, pull it together.

01:13:43.561 --> 01:13:44.839
We have a customer coming up.

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:46.240
Come on, let's go, let's go!

01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:50.867
(somber beat music)

01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:55.513
- You've never needed this?

01:13:56.051 --> 01:13:57.075
Really?

01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:58.166
- No.

01:13:58.167 --> 01:14:00.780
- I feel like I can't
do anything without it.

01:14:00.781 --> 01:14:02.504
(sniffling)

01:14:02.505 --> 01:14:05.523
(dramatic beat music)

01:14:05.524 --> 01:14:08.441
- It's in that pocket, right there.

01:14:09.713 --> 01:14:12.880
(dramatic beat music)

01:14:34.193 --> 01:14:37.110
(women chattering)

01:14:41.296 --> 01:14:43.546
(knocking)

01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:47.233
- Hello.

01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:50.440
Welcome.

01:14:51.166 --> 01:14:52.266
Are you Alex?

01:14:52.267 --> 01:14:53.267
- Yeah.

01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:56.263
Where's the girl I called about?

01:14:56.264 --> 01:14:59.347
(helicopter buzzing)

01:15:01.922 --> 01:15:04.505
(horn honking)

01:15:07.209 --> 01:15:09.509
- Are you sure this is the right spot?

01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:10.510
- I think so.

01:15:13.058 --> 01:15:14.959
- I think we should leave.

01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:17.513
- For 500 bucks, I'm staying.

01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:20.040
- I guess.

01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:24.432
- That's it.

01:15:24.433 --> 01:15:25.433
That's the car.

01:15:34.054 --> 01:15:36.471
(rock music)

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:42.320
- Hey, ladies.

01:15:43.607 --> 01:15:44.607
How are you?

01:15:46.510 --> 01:15:47.929
- Fine.

01:15:47.930 --> 01:15:49.130
- I hope you like metal.

01:15:50.376 --> 01:15:53.459
(intense rock music)

01:16:16.879 --> 01:16:19.459
(thudding)

01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:20.849
- This is classy.

01:16:20.850 --> 01:16:23.100
- Yeah, where do you take the bodies?

01:16:28.830 --> 01:16:31.663
(liquid sloshing)

01:16:33.770 --> 01:16:34.902
- Drink this.

01:16:34.903 --> 01:16:36.159
- I don't drink.

01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:37.297
- Drink this!

01:16:37.298 --> 01:16:40.381
(intense rock music)

01:16:46.249 --> 01:16:48.279
- Get off me, you pig!

01:16:48.304 --> 01:16:49.387
(screaming)

01:16:49.388 --> 01:16:50.742
- Fucking watch!

01:16:50.743 --> 01:16:52.990
(whimpering)

01:16:52.991 --> 01:16:56.074
(intense rock music)

01:16:57.052 --> 01:16:58.226
- Help!

01:16:58.227 --> 01:17:00.333
- Shut the fuck up!

01:17:00.334 --> 01:17:01.468
You fucking cunt!

01:17:01.493 --> 01:17:02.506
(whimpering)

01:17:02.531 --> 01:17:04.349
You can just fucking sit here and watch!

01:17:04.350 --> 01:17:06.098

01:17:55.884 --> 01:17:58.967

01:18:03.866 --> 01:18:05.781
Get the fuck out of my car.

01:18:16.809 --> 01:18:18.219
- It was good.

01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:20.133
- I have to talk to you tomorrow. Just go.

01:18:22.570 --> 01:18:23.570
Hello ladies.

01:18:24.850 --> 01:18:27.609
You did so good.

01:18:27.610 --> 01:18:29.679
I have a present for you.

01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:31.093
Go ahead, open it.

01:18:32.030 --> 01:18:33.030
Come on.

01:18:36.010 --> 01:18:38.209
Beauty, isn't it, huh?

01:18:38.210 --> 01:18:40.509
This is my gift to you.

01:18:40.510 --> 01:18:43.163
More than a thousand dollar each.

01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:49.179
Well?

01:18:49.180 --> 01:18:50.899
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:51.900
You can go now.

01:18:53.740 --> 01:18:55.089
- Aren't we getting paid?

01:18:55.090 --> 01:18:57.299
- You said 500 each.

01:18:57.300 --> 01:19:01.579
- Those are pure million
diamond carrot studs.

01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:03.772
Much more than a thousand dollars.

01:19:03.773 --> 01:19:05.779
I already told you that!

01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:07.513
Much more than 500!

01:19:09.679 --> 01:19:10.853
Don't be dumb.

01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:12.897
Just go now.

01:19:13.585 --> 01:19:14.637
Sero.

01:19:14.638 --> 01:19:16.109
- [Sero] Mhmm.

01:19:16.110 --> 01:19:17.559
- Shara can not leave.

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:19.329
There is a customer here for her.

01:19:19.330 --> 01:19:20.919
- So lucky.

01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:22.349
- No, I can't.

01:19:22.350 --> 01:19:23.912
I'm feeling really sick.

01:19:23.937 --> 01:19:24.956
I need to go home.

01:19:24.957 --> 01:19:26.231
- But he already paid.

01:19:26.256 --> 01:19:27.261
- No.

01:19:27.286 --> 01:19:28.299
- And he only wants you.

01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:29.359
- Come on, you can do it.

01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:31.423
Just one more, then you can go home.

01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:34.519
You'll be fine, go!

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:35.729
- I'll do it with you.

01:19:35.730 --> 01:19:36.799
- Oh, no, no, no.

01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:38.589
He paid only for one

01:19:38.590 --> 01:19:41.643
and we don't any thinking
they can get freebies.

01:19:42.860 --> 01:19:43.999
- I'll wait for you.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.067
- Okay.

01:19:45.068 --> 01:19:48.735
(speaking foreign language)

01:19:56.971 --> 01:20:01.304
- You're more than welcome
to shower if you need to.

01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:14.040
- I don't need a shower.

01:20:15.621 --> 01:20:17.371
But I'm thinking you definitely do.

01:20:21.030 --> 01:20:22.233
You look like shit.

01:20:24.714 --> 01:20:26.869
Can you talk to me? Can you say something?

01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:27.870
You're killing me.

01:20:33.973 --> 01:20:35.140
- You left me.

01:20:38.302 --> 01:20:39.302
You left me.

01:20:40.056 --> 01:20:42.072
- It's okay, you're coming with me now.

01:20:42.097 --> 01:20:43.097
- No.

01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:45.390
I'm not.

01:20:47.383 --> 01:20:48.713
I don't trust you.

01:20:55.450 --> 01:20:57.403
- You don't trust me.

01:21:00.550 --> 01:21:02.600
But you're running around with that scum?

01:21:03.666 --> 01:21:05.999
(chuckling)

01:21:07.310 --> 01:21:09.033
Listen, I'm sorry.

01:21:09.883 --> 01:21:10.943
Okay?

01:21:10.944 --> 01:21:12.049
I fucked up.

01:21:12.050 --> 01:21:13.623
Baby, I fucked up.

01:21:16.050 --> 01:21:18.217
I just can't stop thinking about you.

01:21:30.887 --> 01:21:33.149
You're doing blow?

01:21:33.150 --> 01:21:34.363
- You're one to talk.

01:21:36.578 --> 01:21:37.578
- Come on.

01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:39.439
Please.

01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:41.053
Please, just come with me.

01:21:42.570 --> 01:21:44.552
We could live our life together,

01:21:44.553 --> 01:21:45.743
like we planned.

01:21:46.705 --> 01:21:48.033
We'll figure it out.

01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:51.463
Baby, you're better than is.

01:21:53.589 --> 01:21:56.299
Don't turn into your mom.

01:21:56.300 --> 01:21:58.550
Please, come on, you're
way better than that.

01:22:02.690 --> 01:22:03.690
Look,

01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:08.310
I never told you this

01:22:09.323 --> 01:22:10.583
but it's true.

01:22:16.340 --> 01:22:17.340
I love you.

01:22:21.813 --> 01:22:23.256
- You do?

01:22:23.257 --> 01:22:24.257
- Of course.

01:22:25.415 --> 01:22:28.597
I can't live another second without you.

01:22:34.030 --> 01:22:35.830
- I had a feeling you'd come for me.

01:22:37.752 --> 01:22:39.002
But I can't go.

01:22:42.450 --> 01:22:43.450
They own me now.

01:22:44.891 --> 01:22:46.791
- What the fuck are you talking about?

01:22:47.643 --> 01:22:49.693
- I can't just leave.

01:23:00.250 --> 01:23:02.099
- Just make her pay you for fucking me

01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:03.853
and let's get the fuck out of here.

01:23:04.820 --> 01:23:05.983
- It's not that simple.

01:23:07.574 --> 01:23:08.710
- What do you mean it's not?

01:23:08.711 --> 01:23:09.989
It is that simple, baby.

01:23:09.990 --> 01:23:12.003
- Like, trust me.
- It's not.

01:23:12.028 --> 01:23:13.153
- Trust me.

01:23:13.450 --> 01:23:14.450
I got you.

01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:18.660
- Fine.

01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:21.323
I'll take care of it.

01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:23.540
Just leave.

01:23:25.210 --> 01:23:26.210
Go.

01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:31.630
- I'm not gonna leave you here.

01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:35.893
- I'm trusting you.

01:23:38.191 --> 01:23:40.213
I need you to trust me, okay?

01:23:44.908 --> 01:23:45.908
Go.

01:23:51.371 --> 01:23:52.431
Go.

01:23:52.432 --> 01:23:55.181
(dramatic music)

01:24:36.999 --> 01:24:37.999
- Shit.

01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:42.203
We need some money.

01:24:44.090 --> 01:24:46.040
How much you get from those sick fucks?

01:24:53.430 --> 01:24:54.830
- These are worth something.

01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:07.160
- You gotta be fucking kidding me.

01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:09.240
- What?

01:25:10.310 --> 01:25:11.310
- They're fake.

01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:13.320
- No they're not.

01:25:13.976 --> 01:25:15.070
She wouldn't do that to me.

01:25:15.071 --> 01:25:16.939
She said I was her favorite.

01:25:16.940 --> 01:25:19.040
- If you fog up a diamond with your breath

01:25:20.030 --> 01:25:22.289
the fog evaporates off that
spot if the diamond's real

01:25:22.290 --> 01:25:23.290
and if not,

01:25:24.820 --> 01:25:27.520
they stay cloudy and these
are fucking cloudy as fuck.

01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:29.633
You got scammed.

01:25:32.490 --> 01:25:33.590
Where's all the money?

01:25:39.788 --> 01:25:43.467
I'm not about to let them fuck
you out of what they owe you.

01:25:43.492 --> 01:25:44.641
- Doesn't matter.

01:25:44.666 --> 01:25:45.693
Forget about it.

01:25:45.694 --> 01:25:47.209
- Yeah it does fucking matter.

01:25:47.210 --> 01:25:48.603
- I'm serious.

01:25:51.100 --> 01:25:52.100
Forget it.

01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:55.743
- You fucking kidding me?

01:25:55.744 --> 01:25:56.744
Let's go.

01:25:57.519 --> 01:25:59.043
Let's go, get your fucking bag.

01:26:00.035 --> 01:26:03.118
(ominous beat music)

01:26:12.127 --> 01:26:14.361
- What are you looking for,
there's no money in there.

01:26:14.362 --> 01:26:15.362
I told you.

01:26:17.402 --> 01:26:18.402
Hey.

01:26:20.812 --> 01:26:22.212
What the hell are you doing?

01:26:24.048 --> 01:26:26.669
(sighing)

01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:28.679
- You think I'm gonna
let them do this to you

01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:29.730
and get away with it?

01:26:31.795 --> 01:26:32.795
- I'm worried.

01:26:33.698 --> 01:26:34.698
- Don't be.

01:26:37.210 --> 01:26:39.393
Just stay in the car
and I'll be right back.

01:26:39.394 --> 01:26:40.394
You got it?

01:26:42.587 --> 01:26:43.914
Yeah?

01:26:43.915 --> 01:26:46.021
Okay, come here.

01:26:46.022 --> 01:26:48.844
No one fucks with my girl, okay?

01:26:48.845 --> 01:26:49.845
- Okay.

01:26:51.718 --> 01:26:54.801
(ominous beat music)

01:27:06.871 --> 01:27:07.871
Fuck.

01:27:08.902 --> 01:27:12.069
(dramatic beat music)

01:27:42.431 --> 01:27:44.681
(knocking)

01:27:54.282 --> 01:27:56.325
- Shara is not here.

01:27:56.326 --> 01:27:58.993
Do you want to see someone else?

01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:03.320
- Where's the money?

01:28:05.585 --> 01:28:07.499
Don't fuck with me, lady.

01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:09.155
Now you fucked with my girl.

01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:11.315
Not only do I want her
money, I want all the money.

01:28:11.340 --> 01:28:12.390
Do you understand me?

01:28:13.886 --> 01:28:15.719
Do you understand me?!

01:28:17.194 --> 01:28:18.238
- Yeah.

01:28:18.239 --> 01:28:19.239
- Then move.

01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:23.520
You too, let's go.

01:28:28.100 --> 01:28:30.269
- Beauty, are you still here?

01:28:30.270 --> 01:28:32.069
- Sit the fuck down!

01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:34.820
(dramatic music)

01:28:38.490 --> 01:28:39.843
Where's the fucking money?

01:28:50.114 --> 01:28:52.859
(gunshot booming)

01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:55.610
(dramatic music)

01:29:08.248 --> 01:29:11.331
(heartbeat thumping)

01:29:20.837 --> 01:29:23.170
(screaming)

01:29:25.702 --> 01:29:27.785
(crying)

01:29:40.092 --> 01:29:42.259
(sobbing)

01:29:43.988 --> 01:29:46.738
(dramatic music)

01:30:39.864 --> 01:30:42.614
(dramatic music)

01:31:13.031 --> 01:31:15.281
(knocking)

01:31:17.604 --> 01:31:18.604
- Hey!

01:31:23.210 --> 01:31:26.070
(screaming)

01:31:26.071 --> 01:31:29.429
(dramatic music)

01:31:29.430 --> 01:31:31.763
(screaming)

01:31:41.747 --> 01:31:43.262
- [Shara] Have you ever thought about

01:31:43.287 --> 01:31:45.203
walking into the ocean?

01:31:45.790 --> 01:31:49.480
Like, you start at the
shore and keep walking,

01:31:49.481 --> 01:31:52.622
until the water covers up your head.

01:31:52.623 --> 01:31:54.577
And you just keep going

01:31:56.633 --> 01:31:57.966
until you can't.

01:31:59.378 --> 01:32:02.128
(waves rumbling)

01:32:06.147 --> 01:32:08.897
(dramatic music)

01:33:06.891 --> 01:33:09.641
(dramatic music)

01:34:07.606 --> 01:34:10.356
(dramatic music)

01:35:04.338 --> 01:35:07.171
(dramatic music)
