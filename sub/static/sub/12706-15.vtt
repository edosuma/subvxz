WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.735
(groans) I'm
Faith.

00:02.770 --> 00:04.137
Previously
 on Buffy the Vampire
Slayer...

00:04.171 --> 00:05.405
Open your
present.

00:05.439 --> 00:08.076
This is a thing
of beauty, boss.

00:08.108 --> 00:09.977
That look on your face
is my reward.

00:10.009 --> 00:11.644
GILES: We have a rogue slayer
 on our hands.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.012
I can't think
 of anything more dangerous.

00:13.047 --> 00:14.515
(grunting)

00:19.018 --> 00:21.155
(groans)
DOCTOR: It's a wonder

00:21.189 --> 00:23.190
she's alive at all
with the blood loss.

00:23.224 --> 00:24.591
There's almost no chance that

00:24.625 --> 00:28.396
she's ever gonna
regain consciousness.

00:30.263 --> 00:31.498
RILEY:
 You're really strong.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.100
I like it.

00:33.134 --> 00:37.036
I've worked too long--
too long--

00:37.070 --> 00:40.740
to let some little bitch
threaten this project.

00:40.774 --> 00:42.375
Did Maggie Walsh set you up?

00:42.409 --> 00:44.244
BUFFY: Maggie wanted me dead,
 didn't she?

00:47.046 --> 00:48.781
(gasps)

00:49.582 --> 00:51.585
(screams) Adam?

00:51.618 --> 00:53.887
Mommy.

00:53.920 --> 00:55.756
Why does it bug you so much
that I'm hanging with her?

00:55.789 --> 00:58.125
It bugs me that she's using you
to infiltrate our operation.

00:58.158 --> 00:59.560
You saying she's a spy?

00:59.593 --> 01:03.131
(shivering)
I don't know which team I'm on,

01:03.164 --> 01:04.397
who the bad guys are.

01:07.968 --> 01:10.138
(grunting)

01:12.272 --> 01:13.906
Escort them out.

01:15.242 --> 01:16.843
Buffy.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.819
They smell good, don't they?

01:26.853 --> 01:28.222
What?

01:28.256 --> 01:29.890
Clean sheets.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.057
Like Summer.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.161
I wouldn't know.

01:33.194 --> 01:35.295
Right.

01:35.329 --> 01:37.331
I forgot.

01:37.365 --> 01:39.667
I noticed.

01:41.502 --> 01:43.837
I-I wish I could stay, but...

01:43.871 --> 01:45.338
Oh, you have to go.

01:45.372 --> 01:47.007
It's just with...

01:47.039 --> 01:49.742
Little sis coming. I know.

01:49.777 --> 01:53.381
So much to do
before she gets here.

01:58.117 --> 01:59.453
Now I really have to...

01:59.486 --> 02:00.620
So go.

02:00.653 --> 02:03.290
Don't let me keep...

02:04.792 --> 02:06.593
Damn.

02:06.626 --> 02:08.662
Just when we made it so nice.

02:15.635 --> 02:18.038
Are you ever gonna take
this thing out?

02:20.908 --> 02:23.276
(monitor beeping)

02:23.311 --> 02:25.712
(indistinct P.A. announcements)

02:39.992 --> 02:43.062
(wolf howling)

02:43.096 --> 02:45.199
*

03:34.146 --> 03:36.015
So, here it is.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.718
The latest in
state-of-the-art
combat
technology.

03:38.752 --> 03:40.954
I gotta say, it doesn't look
that complicated.

03:40.987 --> 03:42.756
So can you
repair it?

03:42.789 --> 03:45.224
Sure. Just as soon as I get
my master's
degree

03:45.259 --> 03:48.528
in advanced
starship technology.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.397
Well, why
don't
we experiment?

03:50.430 --> 03:52.199
Press some
buttons,
see what happens.

03:52.231 --> 03:53.933
Well, I'd like to veto that.

03:53.966 --> 03:55.936
Second.

03:55.968 --> 03:57.604
It's called a blaster, Will.

03:57.638 --> 04:00.240
A word that tends
to discourage
experimentation.

04:00.274 --> 04:02.241
Now, if it were called
the Orgasminator,

04:02.276 --> 04:04.611
I'd be the first to try your
basic button-press approach.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.413
Just tell me,
can you repair it or not?

04:06.447 --> 04:09.149
I'm working on
it,
I'm working on
it.

04:09.181 --> 04:11.985
If I blow a hole
in my mom's azalea patch,

04:12.019 --> 04:13.820
the neighbors
will not be pleased.

04:16.023 --> 04:19.326
You all right?

04:19.360 --> 04:20.827
You've been patrolling
around the clock

04:20.860 --> 04:21.961
for three days straight.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.163
Perhaps you
could use some--

04:23.196 --> 04:25.499
What, some rest?

04:25.533 --> 04:27.668
There's a demonoid killing
machine out there, Giles.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.536
It doesn't only work
the night shift.

04:30.803 --> 04:32.305
I was going to
say

04:32.340 --> 04:34.341
perhaps you could
use some backup, but, um...

04:34.375 --> 04:36.744
Now you mention it...

04:36.776 --> 04:39.146
Gathering your strength
might not be a bad idea.

04:39.178 --> 04:42.014
Just get the blaster working.

04:42.048 --> 04:44.117
That's all
the strength I need.

04:44.151 --> 04:45.519
Are you sure?

04:45.552 --> 04:47.355
Why, because ray guns aren't
in the slayer
handbook?

04:47.387 --> 04:49.856
Will, you haven't seen
this Adam thing.

04:49.889 --> 04:52.259
He's the Terminator
without
the bashful charm.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.761
I mean, he's deadly,

04:53.793 --> 04:55.161
and the last time we met,
he kicked my ass.

04:55.194 --> 04:58.031
Oh, no. Blast away,
by all means.

04:58.064 --> 05:00.533
I only meant...

05:00.567 --> 05:02.670
No word about Riley?

05:05.973 --> 05:08.509
They keep telling me
that he's fine.

05:08.541 --> 05:10.110
That's all they'll
say.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.278
Maybe they're
telling the truth.

05:11.310 --> 05:13.146
Maybe.

05:13.180 --> 05:14.781
I don't even know

05:14.814 --> 05:16.884
what the Initiative's
version of fine is.

05:16.917 --> 05:19.353
They could be forcing him
back
onto medication

05:19.387 --> 05:20.887
or torturing him
for all I know.

05:20.920 --> 05:22.355
From what we've seen,

05:22.389 --> 05:23.723
I doubt they'll
be trying to hurt him.

05:23.757 --> 05:24.992
The only thing
that I know for
certain

05:25.024 --> 05:27.026
is that my boyfriend
is locked away,

05:27.060 --> 05:28.261
and I'm not helping.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.632
Maybe Giles has a point.

05:31.665 --> 05:34.634
I mean,
Riley is their Top Gun guy.

05:34.668 --> 05:37.069
It doesn't make sense
that they'd hurt him.

05:37.103 --> 05:39.540
But the
Initiative
has all of those brainwashy,

05:39.572 --> 05:41.542
behavior modification guys.

05:41.574 --> 05:42.475
So?

05:42.509 --> 05:43.911
So what happens

05:43.944 --> 05:45.745
when they start
not liking his behavior?

05:48.949 --> 05:50.617
(groans)

06:06.634 --> 06:08.035
Stand down, soldier.

06:09.769 --> 06:11.771
Stand down before
I put you down.

06:13.139 --> 06:14.274
You heard the
man.

06:14.307 --> 06:15.709
At ease.

06:22.983 --> 06:25.452
The shish kebab
that walks like a man.

06:25.485 --> 06:27.353
Looks like you're
feeling better,

06:27.387 --> 06:29.856
walking around
threatening people and all that.

06:29.889 --> 06:32.024
Man was in my way.
I got places to
be.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.226
Really? And where were you
thinking of going?

06:34.261 --> 06:35.528
You know where
I'm going.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.531
(scoffs)
Don't even tell me

06:37.564 --> 06:38.766
you're headed for that
girlfriend of yours.

06:38.798 --> 06:41.869
Look at you.
One good conjugal visit,

06:41.901 --> 06:43.069
and you're back
in intensive care to stay.

06:43.103 --> 06:45.706
You wouldn't
understand

06:45.738 --> 06:48.141
How about you
explain it to me, then?

06:48.175 --> 06:50.043
We all friends here, fellas?
Absolutely.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.478
Riley here is
about to explain

06:51.512 --> 06:52.913
why he's leaving us
so very quickly.

06:52.946 --> 06:53.980
I don't explain,

06:54.014 --> 06:55.449
because I don't have to.

06:55.483 --> 06:57.317
I'm the one in charge.

06:57.350 --> 07:00.487
Things change.
Do they?

07:00.521 --> 07:02.389
Hey, in case you failed to
notice, we're in a world of hurt

07:02.422 --> 07:04.757
around here. Now's the time
for us to band together,

07:04.791 --> 07:07.160
not go flying off
our separate
ways.
Forrest has a point, Ri.

07:07.194 --> 07:10.396
We have a problem,
we deal with that problem.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.966
You know the most important part
of the equation now

07:13.000 --> 07:15.968
is that we keep said problem
within the family.

07:16.002 --> 07:17.269
Family?

07:17.303 --> 07:20.106
Is that what we are?

07:21.141 --> 07:23.009
Step aside.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.014
(steady beeping)

07:27.047 --> 07:28.848
(thunder
rumbling)

07:30.951 --> 07:33.052
(birds chirping)

07:40.060 --> 07:42.829
FAITH:
 You think it's gonna rain?

07:42.862 --> 07:45.264
Nonsense. It's
a beautiful day.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.834
Now eat your sandwich.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.668
I don't know.
It's just...

07:48.701 --> 07:50.870
It always seems like it starts
raining right about now.

07:50.903 --> 07:53.139
You're too young
and too pretty a girl

07:53.173 --> 07:55.408
to start wearing worry lines
on your face.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.711
Oh, hey, hey,
hey.

07:58.745 --> 08:03.315
Hey there, little fella.
(chuckles)

08:03.350 --> 08:05.052
I don't know
where you belong,

08:05.084 --> 08:07.220
but it's not
here with us.
(chuckles)

08:07.254 --> 08:08.689
There you go.

08:08.721 --> 08:11.858
You see, there's nothing

08:11.891 --> 08:13.293
gonna spoil
our
time together.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.495
Who wants cheesecake?

08:15.528 --> 08:16.730
(chuckles

08:17.764 --> 08:18.865
No!

08:18.899 --> 08:20.733
(grunting)

08:24.071 --> 08:26.706
I told you I had things to
do.

08:28.440 --> 08:31.043
(thunder
rumbling)
(panting)

08:35.883 --> 08:38.284
(crickets chirping)

08:44.924 --> 08:46.158
Spread out?

08:46.192 --> 08:47.827
Not too far.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.863
So not a problem.

09:19.993 --> 09:22.763
I've never seen anything
like that.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.431
And I can go
a long, healthy stretch

09:24.463 --> 09:26.634
without seeing anything
like that again.

09:26.667 --> 09:29.436
It had to be Adam
who killed it. But why?

09:29.469 --> 09:31.705
He's studying biology.
Human, demon,

09:31.739 --> 09:33.572
whatever he can get his hands on
and tear apart.

09:33.606 --> 09:35.375
Learning what makes things work.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.644
XANDER:
I really don't want
to be around

09:36.677 --> 09:37.745
for the final exam.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.046
It's not
coming
to that.

09:39.078 --> 09:41.114
The Initiative created
this thing,

09:41.148 --> 09:43.216
and they can't stop it.
But we will.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.216
XANDER:
Question,

09:44.250 --> 09:46.052
will hiding in a cabin

09:46.086 --> 09:49.088
with stockpiled chocolate goods
be any part of this plan?

09:49.121 --> 09:49.789
No.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.226
Told you.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.062
What's first?

09:56.096 --> 09:58.665
Riley. I'm not
leaving him down there

09:58.698 --> 10:00.232
with the people
that created this thing.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.634
I don't care how
many guns they have.

10:01.668 --> 10:02.635
I'm going in.

10:02.669 --> 10:04.638
Okay,

10:04.672 --> 10:06.974
Will, I need you to hack into
the security mainframe

10:07.006 --> 10:09.408
and buy me a ten-minute shutdown
of operation systems.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.244
That could be...
Tricky

10:11.278 --> 10:13.245
not impossible.
If you can't do it online,

10:13.279 --> 10:15.315
then use magic. Xander,

10:15.347 --> 10:17.017
any gear you've been
saving for a rainy
day,

10:17.049 --> 10:19.519
I want you to
give to
me.
You want stealthy stuff?

10:19.552 --> 10:22.322
No, we tried sneaking in.
This time I'm gonna use
force.

10:22.355 --> 10:23.956
I figure I'll go
in
through the elevator shaft

10:23.990 --> 10:25.192
and use
the
cable as towlines,

10:25.225 --> 10:27.594
then blast open
the facility
doors

10:27.626 --> 10:29.096
and find the
infirmary.

10:29.129 --> 10:29.996
Am I really worth all that?

10:32.865 --> 10:34.234
Riley.

10:35.302 --> 10:36.669
Oh.
Oh!

10:36.703 --> 10:38.538
God, I'm
sorry.
Did I hurt
you?

10:38.571 --> 10:41.307
No. A giant skewer
through the rib cage hurt me.

10:41.341 --> 10:42.975
That was just a reminder.

10:43.009 --> 10:45.278
How did you get out?

10:45.312 --> 10:46.513
I walked.
WILLOW:
They didn't try

10:46.546 --> 10:47.547
to stop you?

10:47.580 --> 10:49.548
Oh, they did. Repeatedly.

10:49.581 --> 10:52.318
But, uh, then I told them
they couldn't keep me

10:52.351 --> 10:54.988
without a major ass-kicking,
one way or another.

10:55.022 --> 10:56.623
Here I am.

10:56.655 --> 10:59.025
That's great, Riley.

10:59.058 --> 11:03.462
And, you know, there's no polite
way to ask you this, but, uh,

11:03.495 --> 11:06.566
did they put a chip
in your brain?

11:06.599 --> 11:07.567
Beg your pardon?

11:07.600 --> 11:08.836
BUFFY:
Forget it.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.070
We're just happy
to have you back.

11:10.102 --> 11:11.739
WILLOW:
Yeah, we were
pretty worried

11:11.772 --> 11:14.875
about you there
for a while, mister.
Me, too.

11:14.908 --> 11:19.645
Hey, look, I know my behavior
was... pretty out there.

11:19.678 --> 11:21.648
Forget it.
Tell you what,

11:21.681 --> 11:24.250
you two crazy kids take down

11:24.283 --> 11:29.422
an unstoppable, killer
cyber-demon... hybrid thingy,

11:29.456 --> 11:32.058
and, uh, we'll call it
all even.

11:32.091 --> 11:33.726
Taking down Adam's
gonna be tough.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.897
There's no way to predict
what he'll throw at us.

11:36.929 --> 11:38.565
You're here.

11:38.597 --> 11:42.269
Whatever comes, we can
handle.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.403
(panting)

11:51.278 --> 11:53.613
(steady beeping)

12:11.764 --> 12:14.734
(grunting)

12:16.469 --> 12:18.571
(thunder
rumbling)

12:18.605 --> 12:20.974
*

12:23.576 --> 12:25.477
(thunder
rumbling)

12:25.511 --> 12:29.149
(grunting)

12:52.038 --> 12:54.474
(lightning crashing)

13:00.779 --> 13:02.514
(shouting)

13:08.520 --> 13:10.490
(steady beeping)

13:10.523 --> 13:12.392
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

13:42.022 --> 13:43.523
Ouch.

13:53.665 --> 13:57.669
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

14:04.510 --> 14:06.078
Excuse me.

14:06.113 --> 14:07.914
You know how to get
to Third Floor West from
here?

14:10.250 --> 14:12.219
Uh, uh...

14:12.251 --> 14:13.653
what?

14:13.686 --> 14:16.322
I see.

14:16.355 --> 14:19.426
Um, you need some help
or something?

14:19.458 --> 14:21.693
Graduation.
What?

14:21.727 --> 14:23.931
Graduation.

14:23.963 --> 14:27.567
I got to get to Sunnydale
High School graduation now.
Well, you can't.

14:27.600 --> 14:31.504
I mean, Sunnydale High School
isn't even there anymore.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.774
What day is it?

14:34.807 --> 14:36.375
Friday.
What date?

14:36.408 --> 14:38.010
The date.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.145
February 25.

14:40.212 --> 14:41.813
What year?

14:42.915 --> 14:44.683
Maybe I should get you

14:44.716 --> 14:46.885
a nurse.
What happened to the school?

14:46.919 --> 14:47.955
Don't you just want to...
Just..

14:47.988 --> 14:50.423
tell me.

14:52.424 --> 14:54.126
Well,

14:54.161 --> 14:57.029
it was a tragedy,
really.

14:57.063 --> 14:59.032
Lots of students died,

14:59.066 --> 15:01.234
the principal, the mayor.

15:01.268 --> 15:05.504
I really think maybe
I should get you some help.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.311
(siren wailing in distance)

15:13.312 --> 15:16.749
BUFFY:
 You know, I never stopped
 thinking about you.

15:18.184 --> 15:20.220
Me neither.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.254
All I had in there was...

15:22.288 --> 15:25.158
this one little part of you.

15:25.192 --> 15:27.726
It's just the scarf part of me,
really.

15:27.759 --> 15:30.462
I'm serious.

15:30.496 --> 15:34.134
Just... knowing
you were out there,

15:34.167 --> 15:36.602
that you
cared...

15:37.669 --> 15:39.905
Think we're being watched?

15:39.938 --> 15:42.308
I don't know.

15:42.341 --> 15:44.244
Does the Initiative do that?

15:44.277 --> 15:46.645
Maybe.

15:46.678 --> 15:49.481
You seem a little...

15:49.515 --> 15:50.817
somewhere else.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.623
Is there anything I can do?

15:59.225 --> 16:01.028
(grunts)

16:01.061 --> 16:03.029
Give me an order.

16:03.062 --> 16:05.965
That's what I do,
isn't it? Follow orders?

16:05.999 --> 16:08.301
You don't have to.

16:08.335 --> 16:09.902
Don't
I?

16:11.703 --> 16:14.673
All my life, that's
what I've been groomed to do.

16:14.706 --> 16:16.676
They say jump, I ask how
high.

16:16.708 --> 16:18.945
I get the job done.

16:18.977 --> 16:22.182
Just don't know
if it's the right job
anymore.

16:25.184 --> 16:28.154
I know how you feel.

16:28.187 --> 16:30.889
Giles used to be part
of this council.

16:30.923 --> 16:33.725
And for years, all they ever did
was give me orders.

16:33.759 --> 16:36.995
Ever obey them?
Sure.

16:38.230 --> 16:42.068
The ones I was going to do,
anyway.

16:42.101 --> 16:45.904
The point is,
I quit the council.

16:45.937 --> 16:48.875
And I was scared.

16:48.908 --> 16:51.878
But it's okay
now.
No, see, that's where
you and I are different.

16:51.911 --> 16:55.081
I just suck
at the whole gray area thing.

16:55.115 --> 16:57.084
It's a choice.

16:57.116 --> 16:59.519
You can go back in there and...

16:59.552 --> 17:02.089
maybe make some changes
from the inside.

17:02.121 --> 17:04.856
Or you-you can quit the team,
fight demons

17:04.891 --> 17:06.259
in your own way.

17:06.291 --> 17:08.928
You make it sound so simple.

17:08.961 --> 17:11.564
I don't even know
what my way is.

17:11.597 --> 17:13.732
Well, it's time to find out.

17:13.766 --> 17:15.666
I'm a soldier.

17:15.701 --> 17:18.270
Take that away, what's left?

17:19.306 --> 17:21.540
A good man.

17:37.589 --> 17:39.558
What are you doing?

17:39.592 --> 17:43.296
I... am looking for
brainwashy chips in your head.

17:43.329 --> 17:46.298
(chuckles

17:46.333 --> 17:47.967
Finding any?

17:48.000 --> 17:49.635
Mm, not sure.

17:49.669 --> 17:53.240
But I should probably
keep looking, just in case.

17:53.272 --> 17:56.909
You've been strong
long enough, Riley Finn.

17:56.942 --> 17:59.412
I'm gonna help you.

17:59.445 --> 18:01.413
And we're gonna find
this demon,

18:01.448 --> 18:03.816
and we're gonna
kill it together.

18:03.849 --> 18:08.255
And in the meantime, you are
gonna stop torturing yourself.

18:08.288 --> 18:11.157
You sure about that?

18:11.191 --> 18:13.960
It's an order.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.734
So what do you mean
she just wasn't there?

18:22.769 --> 18:26.105
I don't know. I came to check
the monitors like I always do

18:26.138 --> 18:28.575
at 8:00.
8:00 is my shift.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.076
I got here on time...

18:30.108 --> 18:31.911
You found the bed
in this
condition?

18:31.943 --> 18:34.513
Haven't touched
a thing.
Get the duty rosters

18:34.547 --> 18:36.816
and check the log. I want
to know exactly what
happened.

18:36.848 --> 18:38.984
Coma patients do not just
get up and walk away.

18:39.018 --> 18:41.188
We are checking
every room

18:41.221 --> 18:43.355
on every floor.
Walk me through this
one more time.

18:43.390 --> 18:46.192
You knew this woman was
wanted
for questioning

18:46.226 --> 18:48.661
in a series of murders.
There's no security

18:48.694 --> 18:50.497
on this wing?
You don't understand.

18:50.529 --> 18:52.832
There's no way
that girl was gonna wake up.

18:52.865 --> 18:54.267
ORDERLY:
Doctor
This can't be happening.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.102
Did you find her?
Another woman,

18:56.134 --> 18:58.637
unconscious and badly beaten.
And she's been stripped.

19:09.316 --> 19:12.151
It's happened. Send the team.

19:19.392 --> 19:21.827
*

19:27.200 --> 19:30.001
(indistinct chatter)

19:37.743 --> 19:40.712
LITTLE GIRL:
Dad, come on.

19:40.747 --> 19:43.450
We're gonna be late.

19:59.398 --> 20:01.800
*

20:03.803 --> 20:06.204
(crickets chirping)

20:13.613 --> 20:15.582
GILES:
The puzzle,
it seems to me,

20:15.615 --> 20:17.849
is why Adam has stayed
dormant
as long as he
has.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.852
WILLOW:
When he's not making
performance art out

20:19.885 --> 20:22.422
of other demons, that is.
RILEY:
He's probably working

20:22.454 --> 20:24.923
off an autonomic
power source.

20:24.957 --> 20:27.559
And because he's straight
out of the box, he needs
to charge up a while.

20:27.594 --> 20:30.262
BUFFY:
Okay, what's
he
charging up for?

20:30.297 --> 20:31.698
XANDER:
Based on the clues, I'll go

20:31.730 --> 20:32.699
with killing spree.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.200
And that's a best-case scenario.

20:34.232 --> 20:35.902
I suppose
a little firepower

20:35.934 --> 20:38.371
would be a good idea
right now.

20:38.404 --> 20:40.606
(whirring)

20:40.640 --> 20:43.209
Hey.

20:43.241 --> 20:46.244
How'd you do that?
Is there,
like,

20:46.278 --> 20:49.382
an on-off button
somewhere in
here?
Blasters are easy.

20:49.415 --> 20:52.151
Adam won't be.
WILLOW: Since
Professor
Walsh designed it,

20:52.183 --> 20:56.388
any chance she left instructions
lying around
somewhere?

20:56.423 --> 20:58.657
BUFFY:
Well, if she did, they're
gonna be in the
Initiative.

20:58.691 --> 21:01.093
Which we can't get into
without
mounting a major
offensive.

21:01.126 --> 21:02.662
Speak for yourself.

21:04.663 --> 21:06.432
I'm just saying.

21:06.465 --> 21:07.834
I must admit, a man on
the inside would be...

21:07.866 --> 21:09.301
A really good idea.

21:09.336 --> 21:11.403
Are you sure you want to
be double agent guy?

21:11.438 --> 21:14.006
Well, I'm not exactly sure
what you'd call me, but...

21:14.039 --> 21:17.477
I will share information.
It's the least I can do.

21:17.509 --> 21:19.912
XANDER:
Riley's right.
It is the least he can do.

21:19.945 --> 21:22.315
(phone ringing)

21:26.152 --> 21:28.119
Hello?

21:28.153 --> 21:30.856
Yes, she is.

21:30.890 --> 21:32.959
Um, it's for you.

21:39.566 --> 21:41.468
BUFFY:
Hello?

21:41.500 --> 21:44.971
Speaking.

21:45.003 --> 21:47.006
What sort of emergency?

21:53.011 --> 21:57.282
Um... no, I haven't.

21:57.316 --> 22:00.653
Thank you. I'll-I'll
let you know.

22:02.221 --> 22:03.154
What is it?

22:04.190 --> 22:06.893
It's Faith.

22:06.925 --> 22:08.994
She's awake.

22:12.898 --> 22:14.866
She beat someone up,

22:14.901 --> 22:17.903
took her clothing, and
disappeared out of the hospital.

22:17.936 --> 22:20.006
No one knows where she is.

22:20.038 --> 22:23.675
I'd say this qualifies for
a Worst Timing Ever award.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.877
WILLOW:
What do we do?
Well, we have to find her.

22:25.912 --> 22:27.646
What about Adam?

22:27.680 --> 22:30.215
I'd hate to see the
pursuit
of a homicidal lunatic

22:30.249 --> 22:32.818
get in the way of pursuing
a homicidal lunatic.

22:32.852 --> 22:35.054
Well, Faith's
not exactly Low-Profile Girl.

22:35.086 --> 22:37.390
I'll patrol and wait for her
to make a move.

22:37.423 --> 22:38.490
Then what?

22:38.525 --> 22:40.326
Oh, I have an idea.

22:40.358 --> 22:42.662
Beat the crap out
of her.
Good plan.

22:42.694 --> 22:44.230
Good on paper

22:44.262 --> 22:46.665
but we still have
a decision to
make.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.667
Do we hand her over to the cops?

22:48.701 --> 22:50.236
They wouldn't
know
what to do with a slayer,

22:50.269 --> 22:51.503
even if they knew we existed.

22:51.538 --> 22:52.904
What about the council?

22:52.939 --> 22:54.740
Been there,
tried that.

22:54.773 --> 22:58.944
Not unlike smothering a
forest
fire with napalm, as I
recall.

22:58.978 --> 23:00.712
Well, the Initiative,
they do have, uh,

23:00.747 --> 23:03.048
containment facilities.
XANDER:
One word--

23:03.082 --> 23:03.950
"evil."

23:03.982 --> 23:05.617
There's no way around it.

23:05.652 --> 23:08.954
Faith is back,
and whether I like it or not...

23:08.988 --> 23:10.856
she's my responsibility.

23:10.890 --> 23:13.092
WILLOW:
Yeah. Too bad.

23:13.125 --> 23:16.127
That was
the funnest coma ever.
We have no idea where she is.

23:16.162 --> 23:20.365
We don't know what she's
thinking, what she's feeling.

23:20.398 --> 23:23.102
Who she's doing.
She could be
terrified.

23:23.134 --> 23:25.104
Maybe she doesn't even remember.

23:25.136 --> 23:27.940
Or-or maybe she does
and-and she's sorry

23:27.973 --> 23:30.241
and she's alone,
hiding somewhere.

23:31.678 --> 23:33.813
Uh, perhaps
there's
some form of, uh,

23:33.846 --> 23:37.817
rehabilitation we just
haven't thought about.
And if not,

23:37.849 --> 23:41.252
ass-kicking makes
a solid plan "B."
I'm not gonna rule it out.

23:41.287 --> 23:43.990
First thing--
we need to find her.

23:44.022 --> 23:45.791
Then we can take it from there.

23:47.759 --> 23:51.096
Who's Faith?

23:51.130 --> 23:53.500
What did you tell him?
The truth--

23:53.532 --> 23:56.102
that she's my
wacky
identical cousin from England

23:56.134 --> 23:58.269
and whenever she
visits, hijinks ensue.

23:58.304 --> 24:01.574
It's good you guys have
such an honest relationship.

24:01.607 --> 24:04.477
No, I told him the story.

24:04.510 --> 24:07.113
I vagued-up a few bits
but no flat-out lies.

24:07.145 --> 24:10.982
That's fair. How'd you handle
the Angel-y
parts?

24:11.017 --> 24:12.984
I did some editing.

24:13.019 --> 24:15.320
It's not that I'm trying
to hide anything from Riley.

24:15.354 --> 24:18.156
It's... just that
that's a longer conversation,

24:18.190 --> 24:20.125
and I had a Faith hunt to do.

24:20.159 --> 24:21.961
Any luck?

24:21.993 --> 24:24.130
Couldn't find her. Don't
know exactly where to place that

24:24.163 --> 24:25.364
in the luck continuum.

24:25.396 --> 24:27.834
At least you're not alone
on this.

24:27.866 --> 24:30.336
I'll bet every cop in Sunnydale
is out there looking for her

24:30.368 --> 24:34.306
right now.
Pressure's definitely
high. I'll tell you,

24:34.339 --> 24:37.308
if I were her, I'd get out
of Dodge post-hasty.

24:37.343 --> 24:38.845
You're not me.

24:46.018 --> 24:49.387
So, check you out, B.
Nice.

24:49.421 --> 24:52.057
The "big girl on campus" thing's
really working for
you.

24:52.090 --> 24:53.826
I've been looking for you.

24:53.859 --> 24:56.528
I've been standing
still for eight months, B.

24:56.563 --> 24:58.865
How hard you
look?

24:59.898 --> 25:01.400
Are you all
right?

25:01.432 --> 25:04.470
Five by five.
That's the thing about a coma--

25:04.502 --> 25:06.705
you wake up all rested
and
rejuvenated

25:06.739 --> 25:09.307
and ready for payback.

25:09.340 --> 25:12.178
So much for pleasantries,
huh?
What'd you think,

25:12.211 --> 25:14.079
I'd wake up and we'd go for tea?

25:14.113 --> 25:16.382
You tried to gut me, Blondie.
You'd have done
the same to me

25:16.414 --> 25:17.549
if you'd had the chance.

25:17.584 --> 25:19.050
So let's have another go at it,

25:19.085 --> 25:21.587
see who lands on top.

25:21.621 --> 25:23.556
It doesn't have to be like this,
you know.

25:23.589 --> 25:27.693
Actually, I think it has
to be exactly like this.

25:27.727 --> 25:29.596
Faith,
these are innocent people.

25:29.628 --> 25:33.164
No such animal.
I guess it was

25:33.199 --> 25:35.000
too much to hope
that you'd use your downtime

25:35.034 --> 25:38.237
to reflect and grow.
Could say the
same about
you.

25:38.269 --> 25:41.007
I mean, you're still the same
old "better than thou" Buffy.

25:41.039 --> 25:43.675
I mean, I knew it somehow.
I kept having this dream.

25:43.710 --> 25:45.577
I'm not sure what it
means, but in the dream,

25:45.612 --> 25:48.447
this
self-righteous
blonde chick stabs me.

25:48.480 --> 25:49.715
And you want to know why?

25:49.749 --> 25:51.718
You had it
coming.

25:51.750 --> 25:53.786
FAITH:
That's one interpretation.
But in my dream,

25:53.819 --> 25:55.887
she does it for a guy.
Try it, Red,

25:55.922 --> 25:56.888
and you lose an arm.

25:56.923 --> 25:58.557
I wake up

25:58.590 --> 26:00.392
to find out that
this blonde chick

26:00.425 --> 26:03.128
isn't even dating the guy she
was so nuts about before.

26:03.162 --> 26:06.097
I mean, she's moved on
to the first college
beefstick she meets.

26:06.132 --> 26:09.635
And not only has she forgotten
about the love of her
life,

26:09.669 --> 26:11.237
she's forgotten
all about the chick

26:11.269 --> 26:13.239
she nearly killed for him.

26:13.271 --> 26:15.473
So that's my dream.

26:15.507 --> 26:18.576
That and some stuff
about cigars and a tunnel.

26:18.611 --> 26:20.613
But, uh, tell me,

26:20.646 --> 26:22.381
college girl,

26:22.413 --> 26:23.615
what does it
mean?

26:23.650 --> 26:25.617
To me?

26:25.652 --> 26:28.386
Mostly, that you still mouth off
about things

26:28.420 --> 26:29.955
you don't understand.

26:29.989 --> 26:31.222
(siren wailing)
Uh-oh.

26:31.257 --> 26:33.491
I guess somebody
knows you're here.

26:33.525 --> 26:36.028
(grunting)

26:39.832 --> 26:40.799
(tires
screeching)

26:40.833 --> 26:42.334
(grunting)

26:42.367 --> 26:43.970
Break it
up!

26:44.002 --> 26:47.138
You took my life, B.
Payback's a
bitch.

26:47.173 --> 26:47.973
Look who's talking.

26:48.007 --> 26:49.675
See ya around.

26:49.709 --> 26:50.476
(grunts)

26:51.711 --> 26:54.145
(grunts)

26:57.215 --> 26:59.050
(shouts)

27:05.857 --> 27:07.326
(grunts)

27:10.328 --> 27:12.832
(indistinct chatter)

27:21.472 --> 27:23.942
WILLOW:
Thanks for coming with.

27:23.976 --> 27:26.612
Hunting for a
psychopathic super-bitch

27:26.644 --> 27:29.015
is definitely in the
above and beyond category.

27:29.048 --> 27:30.682
It's okay, really.

27:30.717 --> 27:34.119
So, um, what do we do
if we find her?

27:34.153 --> 27:37.522
Run. Flee.
Maybe skedaddle.

27:37.556 --> 27:39.525
We're not here to engage.

27:39.557 --> 27:41.993
This is strictly
recon.

27:42.028 --> 27:43.295
(chuckles)

27:43.328 --> 27:44.230
What?

27:44.262 --> 27:45.865
You said "recon."

27:45.897 --> 27:48.666
You're, like,
cool monster-fighter.

27:48.701 --> 27:50.669
Well,
technically,
Faith isn't a monster.

27:50.702 --> 27:52.570
And as far as fighting,
I'd be lucky

27:52.604 --> 27:54.240
to bruise her fist with my face.

27:54.272 --> 27:56.174
Oh.

27:56.208 --> 27:57.375
What?

27:57.409 --> 27:58.676
Face punching.

27:58.711 --> 28:00.479
I'm not so good
with the whole...

28:00.511 --> 28:02.681
Swimming?

28:02.714 --> 28:05.550
Violence.
(chuckles)

28:05.584 --> 28:07.553
Don't worry. We're
sure
to spot Faith first.

28:07.586 --> 28:10.489
She's like this cleavage-y
slut-bomb walking around

28:10.521 --> 28:12.892
going, "Oh, check me out.
I'm wicked cool.

28:12.924 --> 28:14.826
I'm five by
five."

28:14.861 --> 28:18.564
"Five by five"?
Five what by five what?

28:18.596 --> 28:20.900
See, that's the thing.
No one knows.

28:20.932 --> 28:22.902
Buffy can handle
Faith,

28:22.934 --> 28:25.904
and you're plenty
safe with me.

28:25.938 --> 28:30.576
So, um, we recon
till nightfall?

28:30.608 --> 28:33.011
Then the
ritual
hiding begins.

28:33.045 --> 28:35.213
Oh.

28:37.282 --> 28:39.684
The point being,
I could be the target here.

28:39.718 --> 28:42.188
Faith finds Mr. Xander Harris
still in town,

28:42.221 --> 28:44.256
odds are she goes tighter
than catgut.

28:44.289 --> 28:46.258
Got a lot
of pent-up feelings there.

28:46.291 --> 28:49.260
I'm only sayin'.
Yes, I'm sure.

28:49.295 --> 28:52.932
See, I can't be held responsible
for the effect I have on women.

28:52.964 --> 28:55.701
No.
See, Faith and I have

28:55.733 --> 28:57.536
this little thing
between us called history.

28:57.568 --> 28:59.905
(clattering)

29:02.173 --> 29:04.609
(whirring

29:20.491 --> 29:21.794
Spike.

29:21.827 --> 29:23.494
What are you doing here?

29:23.528 --> 29:27.165
Me? Hey, I'm not the one out
of place here.

29:27.199 --> 29:29.101
For your information, smarty,
we've got a rogue slayer

29:29.134 --> 29:32.270
on our hands. Real
psycho killer,
too.

29:32.304 --> 29:34.240
Sounds serious.
GILES:
It is.

29:34.272 --> 29:35.673
What do you know?

29:35.707 --> 29:36.976
What do you need?

29:37.009 --> 29:39.577
Her-- dark hair,

29:39.611 --> 29:42.248
yea tall, name of Faith,

29:42.280 --> 29:44.150
criminally insane.
Have you seen her?

29:44.182 --> 29:46.484
Is this bird
after you?

29:46.518 --> 29:48.153
In a bad way.
Yeah.

29:48.186 --> 29:49.922
Tell you what I'll do then.

29:49.955 --> 29:53.759
I'll head out, find this
girl,

29:53.791 --> 29:56.694
tell her exactly where all
of you are, and then watch

29:56.728 --> 29:59.530
as she kills you.

30:01.532 --> 30:03.501
(sighs)

30:03.535 --> 30:06.105
Can't any one of
your damned little Scooby
club

30:06.137 --> 30:09.775
at least try to remember
that I hate you all?

30:09.807 --> 30:12.678
Just because I can't do
the damage myself

30:12.711 --> 30:14.313
doesn't stop me
from

30:14.346 --> 30:16.714
aiming a loose cannon your way.

30:16.748 --> 30:19.218
And here I
thought
the evening would be dull.

30:19.250 --> 30:21.519
Go ahead!

30:21.553 --> 30:23.189
You wouldn't
even recognize her.

30:23.221 --> 30:26.025
Dark hair, this tall,
name of Faith,

30:26.057 --> 30:27.960
criminally
insane.

30:27.993 --> 30:30.229
I like
this
girl already.

30:33.832 --> 30:36.468
We're dumb.

30:36.501 --> 30:38.871
(helicopter blades whirring)

31:10.469 --> 31:12.871
*

31:17.709 --> 31:20.078
(indistinct chatter)

31:29.587 --> 31:32.723
(indistinct police transmission)

32:02.087 --> 32:03.788
MALE VOICE:
Faith.

32:03.821 --> 32:05.457
A friend sent me.

32:05.490 --> 32:07.326
I got a little remembrance
from him.

32:07.358 --> 32:10.796
(grunting)

32:32.617 --> 32:34.987
(VCR clicking)

32:41.993 --> 32:44.630
WILKINS:
Hello, Faith.

32:44.663 --> 32:46.698
If you're watching this tape,

32:46.731 --> 32:48.866
it can only mean one thing,

32:48.900 --> 32:51.702
I'm dead

32:51.737 --> 32:55.374
and our noble campaign to bring
order to the town of
Sunnydale

32:55.406 --> 32:57.209
has failed,

32:57.242 --> 33:00.046
utterly and completely.

33:00.078 --> 33:03.048
But on the other hand,
heck, maybe we won.

33:03.082 --> 33:05.884
(laughs)
And right now

33:05.916 --> 33:09.721
I'm on some jumbo monitor
in the Richard Wilkins Museum

33:09.755 --> 33:12.723
surrounded by a bunch of kids
sitting Indian-style

33:12.758 --> 33:15.394
and looking up at my face,
filled with fear and wonder.

33:15.426 --> 33:18.196
(chuckles)
Hi, kids.

33:18.230 --> 33:20.199
(laughs)

33:20.231 --> 33:22.901
But the realist in me

33:22.933 --> 33:25.737
tends to doubt
it.

33:25.770 --> 33:29.174
Now, Faith,

33:29.208 --> 33:32.677
as I record this message,
you're, uh...

33:32.711 --> 33:34.413
sleeping,

33:34.445 --> 33:37.548
and the doctors tell me
that you might never wake up.

33:37.583 --> 33:39.484
I don't believe that.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.886
Sooner or later,
you will wake up,

33:41.920 --> 33:44.722
and when you do,
you'll find the world has
gone

33:44.756 --> 33:46.991
and changed on you.

33:47.025 --> 33:50.229
I wish I could make the world
a better place

33:50.261 --> 33:52.330
for you to wake up in.

33:52.364 --> 33:55.067
But tough as it is to accept,

33:55.101 --> 33:57.403
we both have to understand
that even my
power

33:57.435 --> 34:02.407
to protect and watch over you
has its limits.

34:02.441 --> 34:04.675
See, the hard
pill
to swallow here

34:04.710 --> 34:09.514
is that once I'm gone...

34:09.547 --> 34:14.686
your days
are just plain numbered.

34:14.719 --> 34:17.021
Now, I know, I know.
You're a... you're a smart

34:17.054 --> 34:19.023
and capable young woman,

34:19.056 --> 34:20.858
in charge of her own life.

34:20.891 --> 34:23.362
But the problem, Faith,
is that, um,

34:23.393 --> 34:27.431
there won't be a place for
you
in the world anymore.

34:27.465 --> 34:30.268
Right now, I bet you're feeling
very much alone.

34:30.302 --> 34:31.369
(sighs)

34:31.402 --> 34:33.771
But you're never alone.

34:33.804 --> 34:36.541
You'll always have me.

34:36.574 --> 34:39.710
And...

34:39.744 --> 34:41.880
you'll always have this.

34:41.913 --> 34:43.882
(chuckles)

34:43.914 --> 34:45.851
Go ahead. Open the box.

34:47.318 --> 34:50.489
Don't worry,
it's not gonna bite.

34:50.521 --> 34:53.659
That's my job.
(laughs)

34:53.692 --> 34:56.628
Go ahead. Open
it.

34:56.661 --> 34:59.130
Surprise!

34:59.164 --> 35:02.067
See, you don't get these
in any gum ball machine.

35:02.099 --> 35:04.235
When you've been around
as long as I
have,

35:04.269 --> 35:08.173
you make friends. And some
of them forge neat little gizmos

35:08.206 --> 35:10.442
like the one
you're holding right now.

35:10.476 --> 35:13.478
And here's the good news--

35:13.512 --> 35:15.813
just because it's over
for my Faith

35:15.847 --> 35:18.949
doesn't mean she can't go out
with a bang.

35:23.655 --> 35:25.423
(chuckles)

35:25.456 --> 35:28.760
BUFFY:
 She's a very dangerous woman.

35:28.793 --> 35:31.762
Okay, I get
it,
really. Faith bad.

35:31.797 --> 35:33.498
Do I look like
I'm arguing?

35:33.532 --> 35:35.867
Not yet.

35:35.900 --> 35:37.369
But you always make
that innocent
face

35:37.402 --> 35:39.103
right before you start.

35:39.137 --> 35:40.771
Figured that out, huh?
(chuckles)

35:40.806 --> 35:42.373
Damn. Took Mom 12 years

35:42.407 --> 35:45.043
to catch
that one.

35:45.076 --> 35:47.278
All I'm saying is, if you're
in trouble, I want to help.

35:47.313 --> 35:48.447
You can't.

35:48.480 --> 35:49.547
Give me one reason why.

35:50.715 --> 35:52.217
(groans)

35:52.251 --> 35:53.351
That's one.

35:53.385 --> 35:54.786
Okay.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.521
I'm not exactly Action Guy,

35:56.554 --> 35:58.523
but there's got to be something
I can do

35:58.556 --> 36:01.193
besides sit around here waiting
for you to pummel this gal.

36:01.226 --> 36:03.195
Riley, the fact
that you just called Faith a gal

36:03.228 --> 36:04.730
only proves
that you don't know her.

36:04.762 --> 36:07.065
I've never seen anybody
get under your skin

36:07.097 --> 36:08.567
this way before.

36:08.599 --> 36:10.202
What did she do to you exactly?

36:10.235 --> 36:12.471
It's a long
story.

36:12.503 --> 36:14.005
I'm from
Iowa.

36:14.039 --> 36:16.041
We drive four hours
for a high school football game.

36:16.074 --> 36:17.242
Try me.

36:17.275 --> 36:20.246
I told you, okay?

36:20.278 --> 36:23.914
She hurt me
and... people that I care about.

36:23.949 --> 36:26.150
And did I mention
the psycho killer part?

36:26.184 --> 36:27.885
There's something
you're not telling me.

36:27.918 --> 36:31.021
Riley, I have to go.
She's out there.

36:31.056 --> 36:33.992
All right.
I'm just saying,

36:34.025 --> 36:36.027
I think you're holding out
on me.
Riley,

36:36.061 --> 36:37.663
this isn't a
joke.

36:37.695 --> 36:40.498
Okay, there's a criminally
insane woman out there

36:40.532 --> 36:42.233
with superpowers

36:42.268 --> 36:45.836
who thinks that I'm responsible
for ruining her life.

36:45.871 --> 36:48.606
I know Faith.

36:48.639 --> 36:50.108
She'll come after me,

36:50.141 --> 36:51.710
and she'll come after the people
that I love.

36:51.742 --> 36:52.978
(knocking)

36:57.449 --> 36:58.949
Hi, Joyce.

37:01.119 --> 37:03.489
(thud)

37:05.123 --> 37:07.425
Mind if I come
in?

37:12.230 --> 37:16.268
(clicks tongue)
Ruby Sunset.

37:16.302 --> 37:19.304
Burgundy Skyline?

37:20.306 --> 37:22.273
Harlot.

37:22.307 --> 37:25.143
Mmm. Way to go, Joyce.

37:25.175 --> 37:28.313
Now, normally, I wouldn't be
going with a color this dark,

37:28.347 --> 37:30.581
but I read in some magazine
eight months in a coma

37:30.615 --> 37:33.452
will damage
a girl's natural skin tone.

37:34.652 --> 37:37.588
Good thing pale is in this year.

37:37.623 --> 37:40.891
Or was it last year?

37:40.925 --> 37:42.927
Mwah.

37:42.960 --> 37:45.797
Anyway,
for real now,

37:45.831 --> 37:47.632
I'm gonna ask you something,
and you got to promise

37:47.666 --> 37:49.735
you'll be honest
and not spare my feelings

37:49.768 --> 37:53.103
just 'cause I could kill you.
You promise?

37:53.137 --> 37:56.574
I promise.
Okay.

37:56.608 --> 37:59.010
How do I look?

38:01.980 --> 38:04.014
Psychotic.

38:04.048 --> 38:07.353
Hmm. I was shooting for sultry,
but, hey...

38:07.385 --> 38:09.253
Bet I know what you're thinking.

38:09.286 --> 38:11.255
Really?

38:11.289 --> 38:15.960
You're thinking, "You'll
never get away with this." Warm?

38:15.994 --> 38:17.528
Actually, I was thinking
my daughter

38:17.563 --> 38:18.797
is going to kill you soon.

38:18.829 --> 38:20.431
That a fact?

38:20.465 --> 38:22.266
More like a bet.
Whoa.

38:22.300 --> 38:23.668
You got a pair on you, Joyce.

38:23.702 --> 38:26.103
I like seeing
that
in a woman your age.

38:26.137 --> 38:27.838
Guess you can afford
to talk that way.

38:27.873 --> 38:29.440
I mean, in the world
according to Joyce,

38:29.474 --> 38:31.610
Buffy is gonna come crashing
through that door

38:31.643 --> 38:33.811
any minute.

38:36.047 --> 38:37.449
But...

38:37.483 --> 38:39.485
look what I
found.

38:41.487 --> 38:45.023
Buffy Summers. Buffy Summers.
Buffy Summers.

38:45.056 --> 38:48.126
Buffy, Buffy. A lot of letters.

38:48.159 --> 38:50.829
She, uh, hasn't been by
in a while, huh?

38:50.862 --> 38:54.800
And you'd think, with a crazy
chick like me on the loose--

38:54.833 --> 38:57.202
crazy chick with a wicked grudge
against her, no less--

38:57.235 --> 38:59.704
she'd call
and give you a heads-up.

38:59.737 --> 39:01.873
But Buffy's too into

39:01.907 --> 39:04.876
her own deal
to remember dear old mom.

39:04.909 --> 39:07.144
You don't know the first
thing
about Buffy.

39:07.177 --> 39:08.380
Or me.

39:08.414 --> 39:10.382
Don't I?

39:10.416 --> 39:12.384
I know what it's like.

39:12.418 --> 39:14.820
You think you matter. You think
you're a part of something,

39:14.853 --> 39:16.554
and you get dumped.

39:16.588 --> 39:19.490
It's like the whole world
is moving, but you're stuck.

39:19.525 --> 39:21.559
Like those
animals
in the tar pits.

39:21.592 --> 39:24.896
It's like you just keep sinking
a little deeper every day,

39:24.929 --> 39:26.331
and nobody even sees.

39:26.364 --> 39:28.166
Were you planning
to slit my throat

39:28.199 --> 39:30.235
anytime soon?
Don't tell me

39:30.268 --> 39:32.570
you don't see it, Joyce.
You've served your purpose.

39:32.603 --> 39:34.405
You squirted out the kid,
raised her up,

39:34.440 --> 39:36.240
and now you might
as well be dead.

39:36.273 --> 39:38.342
I mean, nobody cares,
nobody remembers,

39:38.376 --> 39:41.847
especially not Buffy,
fabulous superhero.

39:41.880 --> 39:45.182
Sooner or later, you're
gonna have to face it--

39:45.215 --> 39:47.585
she was over us
a long time ago, Joyce.

39:47.619 --> 39:49.855
Too busy climbing
onto her new boy toy

39:49.887 --> 39:52.056
to give a single thought
to the people that matter!

39:52.090 --> 39:55.260
I mean, you're her mother,
and
she just leaves you here to die!

39:55.293 --> 39:57.829
(grunting)

39:58.996 --> 39:59.898
Hi, Mom.

39:59.931 --> 40:00.965
Hi, honey.

40:00.998 --> 40:02.768
(grunting)

40:23.320 --> 40:26.224
Thought I'd go after
the clean marine,

40:26.257 --> 40:27.626
didn't ya? He's a cutie.

40:27.659 --> 40:29.260
Looks like he could use
a good roll in the sack.

40:29.293 --> 40:31.597
(grunting)

40:31.630 --> 40:34.733
You're not his type.
He's not big on sleaze.

40:34.766 --> 40:37.469
(grunting)

40:41.773 --> 40:43.173
He's probably
just never tried it.

40:43.208 --> 40:45.976
Going for the boyfriend
again?
That's tired.

40:46.010 --> 40:48.514
Just something to remember me by
once I've moved on.

40:48.547 --> 40:50.882
(grunting)

40:52.117 --> 40:53.784
Ever occur to you, Faith,

40:53.818 --> 40:55.887
the reason we all forgot you
is because we wanted to?

41:05.864 --> 41:08.534
(grunting)

41:17.175 --> 41:19.510
Hello, Rupert.

41:25.150 --> 41:27.418
(grunting)
(sirens wailing in distance)

41:29.186 --> 41:30.755
Cops.

41:33.824 --> 41:37.362
(grunting)

41:37.394 --> 41:38.463
(tires
screeching)

41:38.496 --> 41:40.030
(grunting)

41:52.677 --> 41:55.880
(grunting)

41:55.914 --> 41:59.217
(whooshing)

42:06.423 --> 42:07.224
(grunts)

42:07.257 --> 42:09.695
(thud)

42:10.728 --> 42:12.998
You okay?

42:13.030 --> 42:15.400
All things considered.

42:15.432 --> 42:16.668
What is that?

42:16.702 --> 42:18.402
Weapon of some kind.

42:21.106 --> 42:24.375
Didn't work, whatever it was.

42:24.409 --> 42:25.543
(banging on door)
Oh, the police.

42:30.114 --> 42:32.083
She's their problem now.

42:33.117 --> 42:34.820
You sure you're okay?

42:37.822 --> 42:41.092
Five by five.

43:24.302 --> 43:26.672
Grr. Argh.
