Oh.

00:57.055 --> 00:59.256
Ooh, my little star

00:59.257 --> 01:00.990
has a Hormonee-os show today.

01:01.025 --> 01:02.125
Hormone-iums.

01:02.126 --> 01:03.393
Ugh, we have the Internet now,

01:03.394 --> 01:04.561
do we still have
to listen to songs

01:04.562 --> 01:06.028
about puberty during lunch?

01:06.064 --> 01:07.598
What's the show about this time?

01:07.599 --> 01:08.765
Changing bodies?

01:08.766 --> 01:09.867
Aunt Flo?

01:09.868 --> 01:10.968
We have an Aunt Flo?

01:10.969 --> 01:12.535
She's missed all my birthdays.

01:12.570 --> 01:13.937
(sighs)

01:13.938 --> 01:15.938
We're performing
"Body Hair! Where? There!"

01:15.974 --> 01:17.840
Tina, you seem upset.
Do you not like that one?

01:17.876 --> 01:19.476
No, I love it.

01:19.477 --> 01:21.411
It's just... I've been
in that group for two years,

01:21.412 --> 01:23.413
and even though I'm totally
over my stage fright now,

01:23.414 --> 01:25.348
Mr. Frond has never
given me a solo.

01:25.383 --> 01:28.051
Chorus is just as big a deal
as the solos, sweetie.

01:28.052 --> 01:29.987
Just because people
don't care about something

01:29.988 --> 01:31.268
doesn't mean it's not important.

01:31.289 --> 01:32.288
Thanks, Mom.

01:33.591 --> 01:35.225
Lost and Found auction time.

01:35.226 --> 01:36.959
All right!
I'm ready, Linda.

01:36.995 --> 01:38.562
We got a pager,

01:38.563 --> 01:40.897
a thermos with something
rattling around inside it.

01:40.932 --> 01:43.032
Oh, my God, maybe
it's an emerald!

01:43.067 --> 01:44.401
Could be.

01:44.402 --> 01:45.903
You got to buy it to find out.

01:45.904 --> 01:48.272
We also got a "I Voted" sticker;

01:48.273 --> 01:50.314
could save you a trip
to the polls next year.

01:50.341 --> 01:51.275
I want that!
All right,

01:51.276 --> 01:53.075
Teddy, get down!

01:53.111 --> 01:55.078
One really large
high-heeled pump,

01:55.079 --> 01:57.247
and a half bottle of Chardonnay.

01:57.248 --> 01:58.749
Hey, I left that here.

01:58.750 --> 02:00.517
Guys, this stuff
isn't that good.

02:00.518 --> 02:01.752
I mean, you know

02:01.753 --> 02:03.052
you don't have to
buy anything, right?

02:03.087 --> 02:04.821
Uh-uh, yes we do, Bobby.

02:04.822 --> 02:06.523
Linda's such a good saleswoman.

02:06.524 --> 02:08.324
She sold me a nickel
for a dime once.

02:08.326 --> 02:10.333
Great nickel, too, super shiny.

02:10.360 --> 02:12.628
All right, just... Come on,
come on, come on, I'm so excited!

02:12.664 --> 02:14.164
Yup.
Okay, here we go.

02:14.165 --> 02:15.465
You know the rules.

02:15.466 --> 02:17.000
Your hand goes up,
you got to pay,

02:17.001 --> 02:18.968
so don't stretch or wave
unless you got the dough.

02:19.003 --> 02:20.970
FROND:
Three minutes, performers.

02:21.005 --> 02:22.339
Angela, you look a little pale.

02:22.340 --> 02:23.440
Do you have blush
or would you like

02:23.441 --> 02:24.508
one of the other students

02:24.509 --> 02:25.809
to slap you?
Your choice.

02:25.810 --> 02:26.809
I have blush.

02:26.844 --> 02:28.378
Hi Tina.
Wassup, girl?

02:28.379 --> 02:30.146
Hi Jimmy Jr., Zeke.

02:30.181 --> 02:31.381
Hey, did you hear
about Jocelyn's party

02:31.382 --> 02:33.350
this Friday night...
You mean about

02:33.351 --> 02:34.518
the 45 minute window
when her mom is going

02:34.519 --> 02:35.584
to pick up her brother
from soccer practice

02:35.620 --> 02:37.019
and her dad is
on a business trip

02:37.055 --> 02:38.789
so there will be
(whispering): spin the bottle.

02:38.790 --> 02:39.789
Um, yes, I heard.

02:39.824 --> 02:41.691
Yeah, that one.
Pretty crazy, huh?

02:41.726 --> 02:43.327
It's not that crazy
once you realize

02:43.328 --> 02:44.962
that the bottle's rotation
is pretty predictable

02:44.963 --> 02:46.330
if you can figure out
the drag so you just...

02:46.331 --> 02:47.463
Tina, line up.

02:48.333 --> 02:49.498

02:59.410 --> 03:02.111
Ow, Mr. Frond, she fell on me.

03:02.146 --> 03:04.147
(whispering):
Is this part of the show?

03:04.148 --> 03:05.349
I have no idea

03:05.350 --> 03:07.316
but this is the best
they've ever been.

03:07.352 --> 03:08.485
Angela, come with me.

03:08.486 --> 03:09.685
Everyone else, keep going.

03:09.721 --> 03:12.154
And people say
that theater is dead.

03:12.190 --> 03:13.155
LINDA: <i>15 now, who'll say 15?</i>

03:13.191 --> 03:14.324
For this very nice

03:14.325 --> 03:15.658
book of matches, 15 cents.

03:15.693 --> 03:17.594
15!
15 cents from the sexy

03:17.595 --> 03:18.595
stylist on the stool.

03:18.596 --> 03:19.595
Do I hear 20 cents?

03:19.597 --> 03:20.796
Oh, oh, me!

03:20.832 --> 03:22.399
Oh, I got 20 cents
from the tomb raider,

03:22.400 --> 03:23.399
Mort the mortician.

03:23.401 --> 03:24.568
Twenty-five!

03:24.569 --> 03:25.868
Whoa, too rich for my blood.

03:25.903 --> 03:26.903
Going once...

03:26.904 --> 03:28.071
going twice...

03:28.072 --> 03:29.872
sold to Teddy for 25 cents.

03:29.907 --> 03:31.441
Yeah! Yes!

03:31.442 --> 03:32.442
In your face, Mort.

03:32.443 --> 03:33.443
In your face.

03:33.444 --> 03:34.444
Easy.

03:34.445 --> 03:35.746
Sorry, sorry, you know I get

03:35.747 --> 03:36.746
carried away at the auction.

03:36.781 --> 03:38.415
Okay, next item is

03:38.416 --> 03:40.217
an extra large, extra in-charge

03:40.218 --> 03:43.387
women's high-heel shoe,
left behind by Marshmallow.

03:43.388 --> 03:44.621
I asked her if
she wanted it back,

03:44.622 --> 03:45.922
she said it was out of season.

03:45.923 --> 03:47.357
Let's start the bidding
at one dollar.

03:47.358 --> 03:48.925
One dollar, come on, people.

03:48.926 --> 03:50.527
Teddy?

03:50.528 --> 03:52.696
I don't know any extra
large one-legged ladies,

03:52.697 --> 03:53.964
but if I did, man,

03:53.965 --> 03:55.032
I would be getting that shoe.

03:55.033 --> 03:56.266
50 cents?

03:56.267 --> 03:57.524
Forty-five?

03:57.535 --> 03:58.868
Thirty?

03:58.903 --> 04:01.471
You're missing the possibilities,
here, people.

04:01.472 --> 04:02.806
It's not just a giant shoe,

04:02.807 --> 04:03.907
it's a, it's a...

04:03.908 --> 04:05.575
it's a... uh,

04:05.576 --> 04:06.977
it's a Wine Shoe.

04:06.978 --> 04:10.413
Yeah, it's an elegant way
to display your wine.

04:10.448 --> 04:11.782
Oh, my God, I love it.

04:11.783 --> 04:13.150
It's like a foot
that gets you drunk.

04:13.151 --> 04:14.551
Five dollars.

04:14.552 --> 04:16.084
No, no, no, no, no, six!
Uh, seven!

04:16.120 --> 04:18.461
Really?
Okay, seven dollars going once.

04:18.488 --> 04:19.656
Eight!

04:19.656 --> 04:21.224
Eight dollars, do I hear nine...
Nine!

04:21.225 --> 04:22.291
Mike, you want that thing?

04:22.326 --> 04:23.692
You don't?
No.

04:23.728 --> 04:25.394
Good.
$15!

04:25.430 --> 04:26.862
Do I hear $15.50?

04:26.898 --> 04:27.963
Uh...

04:27.999 --> 04:30.434
$15 going once.
(Teddy groaning)

04:30.435 --> 04:32.102
Twice!
(groaning)

04:32.103 --> 04:33.102
And three times a lady,

04:33.104 --> 04:34.604
sold to Gretchen for $15.

04:34.605 --> 04:35.906
Thank you very much.

04:35.907 --> 04:37.740
Oh, that is gonna haunt me.

04:37.775 --> 04:39.575
FROND:
<i>Thank you all for coming in.</i>

04:39.610 --> 04:41.645
I have terrible
slash wonderful news,

04:41.646 --> 04:42.913
Hormone-iums.

04:42.914 --> 04:45.281
Angela has come down
with mononucleosis!

04:45.316 --> 04:47.049
Oh, no, will she be okay?

04:47.085 --> 04:48.085
Who knows?

04:48.086 --> 04:49.352
But the real news is

04:49.353 --> 04:50.787
that to confront
this urgent crisis,

04:50.788 --> 04:52.656
there will be a special
assembly this Friday

04:52.657 --> 04:54.990
about the dangers of mono,
and I have asked the principal

04:55.026 --> 04:57.259
to ask us to perform at it...

04:57.295 --> 05:00.463
and he said,
wait for it, "Fine."

05:00.498 --> 05:03.100
So, this Friday,
The Hormone-iums will present

05:03.101 --> 05:07.937
our new review,<i> Mona Nucleosis,</i>
on the auditorium stage!

05:07.972 --> 05:08.805
(all gasp)

05:08.806 --> 05:10.207
Exactly!

05:10.208 --> 05:11.341
I'll be holding auditions
between Tina and Candy

05:11.342 --> 05:12.341
to determine who will

05:12.343 --> 05:14.277
temporarily replace Angela

05:14.278 --> 05:15.479
as our female soloist.

05:15.480 --> 05:17.114
Tina can have it.

05:17.115 --> 05:19.149
I'm just in this group
as a punishment. Wait, what?

05:19.150 --> 05:21.117
What?
Nothing, congrats, Tina.

05:21.152 --> 05:24.019
Okay... congratulations
to our new soloist,

05:24.055 --> 05:25.055
Tina Belcher.

♪ Oh, my God. ♪

05:26.891 --> 05:29.158
I mean, I guess that'd be okay.

05:38.362 --> 05:40.697
ZEKE: Tina, look over here!

05:40.698 --> 05:42.564
PETER: Tina, we love you!

05:42.600 --> 05:44.466
She's great.
She's so great.

05:44.502 --> 05:45.501
Tina, is it true

05:45.536 --> 05:47.237
that you'll be starring
as Mona Nucleosis

05:47.238 --> 05:49.072
at the all-school
assembly this Friday?

05:49.073 --> 05:51.341
Well, I don't want
to brag, but it's true.

05:51.342 --> 05:52.575
(crowd cheering)

05:52.576 --> 05:54.944
Tina, I know this
is weird timing,

05:54.945 --> 05:57.013
but will you marry me?

05:57.014 --> 05:58.114
No, no, no, marry me!

05:58.115 --> 05:59.282
No, marry me!

05:59.283 --> 06:00.583
You get over here.
Ow, Zeke, ow!

06:00.584 --> 06:01.584
Ow, Zeke!
(grunting)

06:01.585 --> 06:02.718
Zeke, ow! Zeke!

06:02.753 --> 06:04.954
I could get used to this.

06:04.955 --> 06:06.189
Tina-bean-a,

06:06.190 --> 06:07.557
time to get ready for school.

06:07.558 --> 06:09.459
More like school needs
to get ready for me.

06:09.460 --> 06:10.460
Love it!

06:10.461 --> 06:11.894
Love the confidence.

06:11.929 --> 06:13.762
Linda!

06:13.797 --> 06:15.565
Have I got a bone
to pick with you.

06:15.566 --> 06:16.799
Me?
Yes, you.

06:16.800 --> 06:17.800
What?

06:17.801 --> 06:19.035
My girlfriends at the salon

06:19.036 --> 06:20.904
love the Wine Shoe so much,

06:20.905 --> 06:22.572
they will not stop bugging me

06:22.573 --> 06:23.739
to order one for them.
(gasps)

06:23.774 --> 06:25.074
It's like the Patrick Dempsey

06:25.075 --> 06:27.243
calendar situation
all over again.

06:27.244 --> 06:29.245
Oh, my God, really?

06:29.246 --> 06:31.281
Yeah, I've got four hairdressers

06:31.282 --> 06:34.016
who are willing to pay upwards
of, like, $20 for one.

06:34.051 --> 06:35.618
Stop it.
Yeah.

06:35.619 --> 06:36.719
You hear that, Bob?

06:36.720 --> 06:37.987
I heard.

06:37.988 --> 06:39.422
You don't have any
more Wine Shoes, though.

06:39.423 --> 06:41.324
Right, well, uh, let's see.

06:41.325 --> 06:42.625
I can call Marshmallow

06:42.626 --> 06:43.793
and see where
she gets her shoes.

06:43.794 --> 06:44.894
Bob, give me her number.

06:44.895 --> 06:46.396
I-I don't have her number, Lin.

06:46.397 --> 06:47.664
Oh, I thought you had it.

06:47.665 --> 06:49.599
Okay, uh, do you know
where she lives?

06:49.600 --> 06:52.335
All I know about Marshmallow
is that she comes and goes

06:52.336 --> 06:54.437
as she pleases,
she answers to no one,

06:54.438 --> 06:55.972
and she is truly free.

06:55.973 --> 06:58.274
Okay, calm down.
She's a free spirit, we get it.

That seems kind of extreme.

07:42.319 --> 07:45.121
Oh, okay, Tina, perhaps
we should do a non-extreme show.

07:45.122 --> 07:46.222
That'll get our point across,
right?

07:46.223 --> 07:47.589
Something subtle?

07:47.625 --> 07:49.325
I'm just not sure
this is the best way

07:49.326 --> 07:50.727
to teach kids about mono.

07:50.728 --> 07:52.662
I mean, most of the time,

08:04.541 --> 08:06.075
and, Candy, let's make sure

08:06.076 --> 08:07.810
those jazz hands look
a little jazzier, okay?

08:07.811 --> 08:09.578

08:10.914 --> 08:11.914
(sighs)

08:11.915 --> 08:12.982
Maybe no one will come

08:12.983 --> 08:14.250
to the mandatory assembly.

08:14.251 --> 08:16.753
Kids, your dad
and I are going to Toe-Tanic

08:16.754 --> 08:18.321
so we can make more Wine Shoes.

08:18.322 --> 08:20.990
Oh, my gosh, we're almost
out of Wine Shoes?!

08:20.991 --> 08:22.759
What the heck are you
guys talking about?

08:22.760 --> 08:25.061
Toe-Tanic is an over-sized
women's shoe store.

08:25.062 --> 08:27.063
Wine Shoe is a thing
your mom invented,

08:27.064 --> 08:28.865
and now Gretchen's
friends want to buy

08:28.866 --> 08:30.233
them for some reason.

08:30.234 --> 08:32.068
Of course, of course,
makes perfect sense.

08:32.068 --> 08:35.169
W-w-w-wait, you are not going
to Toe-Tanic without me.

08:35.205 --> 08:36.606
I guess you can come.

08:36.607 --> 08:37.774
Like you could stop me!

08:37.775 --> 08:39.075
All right, fine, I'll go,

08:39.076 --> 08:40.076
and I'm in charge of everything.

08:40.077 --> 08:41.076
I called it.

08:41.078 --> 08:42.309
Tina, you want to go?

08:42.346 --> 08:43.845
No, I'm good.

08:43.881 --> 08:44.881
Tina, you okay?

08:44.882 --> 08:46.549
Yeah, fine, fine, fine.

08:46.550 --> 08:48.518
Just going over
my script for the big show.

08:48.519 --> 08:50.286
Well, we're all
really proud of you

08:50.287 --> 08:52.055
and your...
and your puberty stuff.

08:52.056 --> 08:53.189
I know it's a big deal to you.

08:53.190 --> 08:54.424
Yeah, I'll just stay here

08:54.425 --> 08:55.425
and memorize my lies.

08:55.426 --> 08:56.825
I mean lines!
Bye!

08:56.860 --> 08:58.728
O-okay, see you in a bit.
Great!

08:58.729 --> 09:00.530
Let's go to the land
where the women are big

09:00.531 --> 09:02.130
and the dreams are bigger.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.500
MAN: <i>Hello, welcome.</i>

09:05.536 --> 09:07.136
I'm Adrian.
How can I help you?

09:07.137 --> 09:09.305
Hi, we're in
the market for high heels.

09:09.306 --> 09:10.338
Sir, my mom's

09:10.374 --> 09:11.974
got a business idea.

09:11.975 --> 09:14.509
It's called Wine Shoe,
and we want to buy in bulk.

09:14.545 --> 09:15.912
Well that sound...
I'm sorry, wait,

09:15.913 --> 09:18.114
did you just say "Wine Shoe"?

09:18.115 --> 09:19.982
Yeah! You take a bottle of wine,

09:19.983 --> 09:21.183
and you put it in a shoe.

09:21.218 --> 09:22.118
Uh-huh...

09:22.119 --> 09:23.286
Right?

09:23.287 --> 09:24.920
Oh... that's it?

09:24.955 --> 09:26.322
Yeah!
Pretty good, right?

09:26.323 --> 09:27.824
Yeah.
Now, what will a pair

09:27.825 --> 09:29.659
of these honeys
set my client back?

09:29.660 --> 09:30.660
Oh, those?

09:30.661 --> 09:32.261
Uh, they're $155.

09:32.262 --> 09:34.230
(coughs) Wow! Okay.

09:34.231 --> 09:37.767
Can you show us something
in the, uh... ten dollar range?

09:37.768 --> 09:38.835
Ten dollars?

09:38.836 --> 09:39.902
Uh, okay.

09:39.903 --> 09:41.504
Do you know how much material

09:41.505 --> 09:43.305
goes into a size 14
woman's shoe?

09:43.340 --> 09:44.907
How much engineering?

09:44.908 --> 09:48.376
This heel will hold up
to 350 pounds of woman.

09:48.412 --> 09:49.946
Walking... working...

09:49.947 --> 09:51.514
dancing... living.

09:51.515 --> 09:53.182
In fact, my good friend,

09:53.183 --> 09:54.817
the incredible
Miss Taint Behavin'

09:54.818 --> 09:58.087
does five shows a weekend
in these exact shoes.

09:58.088 --> 10:00.590
So even if there was a ten
dollar size 14 woman's shoe,

10:00.591 --> 10:02.425
I wouldn't sell it.

10:02.426 --> 10:03.860
Lives are at stake!

10:03.861 --> 10:05.428
How old do you have
to be to work here?

10:05.429 --> 10:06.462
Twenty-seven.

10:06.463 --> 10:08.130
LINDA: <i>Oh, well,</i>

10:08.165 --> 10:10.199
what's the use of having dreams

10:10.200 --> 10:11.300
if they can't be crushed?

10:11.301 --> 10:12.935
Hold on, Mom.

10:12.936 --> 10:15.271
Maybe we don't need
to buy those shoes right now.

10:15.272 --> 10:17.140
What? Then all we'd have is wine

10:17.141 --> 10:18.441
and what good is that?

10:18.442 --> 10:19.675
I can't believe
I just said that.

10:19.676 --> 10:21.844
We pitch our idea to investors.

10:21.845 --> 10:23.846
What investors?
Where do we find investors?

10:23.847 --> 10:25.447
Right... there.

10:25.482 --> 10:26.949
(laughing)

10:26.950 --> 10:28.518
Oh, hello, Belchers!

10:28.519 --> 10:30.153
Just having one
of our money fights.

10:30.154 --> 10:31.820
(laughing): Get away!

10:31.855 --> 10:33.222
(Fischoeder and Felix laughing)
See what I mean, Mom?

10:33.223 --> 10:34.724
(gasps) FELIX: I got you!

10:34.725 --> 10:36.325
No, no, what're you
talking about?

10:36.326 --> 10:37.526
BOB AND LOUISE: Oh, my God.

10:39.329 --> 10:41.096
This just in.
Someone got mono so

10:41.131 --> 10:42.799
now we all have to watch a play.

10:42.800 --> 10:44.033
Here's more from Jocelyn.

10:44.034 --> 10:45.568
Thanks, Tammy.

10:45.569 --> 10:48.204
The play is this Friday,
which is also my birthday.

10:48.205 --> 10:49.972
There will be
an all school assembly,

10:49.973 --> 10:52.642
where the Hormone-iums
will perform,<i> Mona Nucleosis,</i>

10:52.643 --> 10:54.343
a show about
the dangers of mono,

10:54.344 --> 10:55.978
but it's not about my birthday,
I don't think.

10:55.979 --> 10:56.978

11:40.593 --> 11:41.994
Do you know how long

11:41.995 --> 11:43.629
I've been trying to get
the principal to let

11:43.630 --> 11:45.630
the Hormone-iums perform
on that stage?!

11:45.665 --> 11:48.300
And no one is going to think
you really hate kissing.

11:48.301 --> 11:50.669
Do people think Tony Danza
is really The Boss?

11:50.670 --> 11:53.005
I do, I mean,
he's at least a boss.

11:53.006 --> 11:54.673
(groaning)

11:54.674 --> 11:57.443
Oh, Tina, you always
wanted to be a soloist,

11:57.444 --> 12:00.412
and now you will be and it
doesn't have to stop there.

12:00.413 --> 12:01.747
I mean, this could be

12:01.748 --> 12:03.782
just the beginning
of solos for you.

12:03.783 --> 12:05.317
Really?
Yes.

12:05.318 --> 12:06.819
Hey, what if I made you

12:06.820 --> 12:09.988
the female Hormone-iums
soloist permanently?

12:09.989 --> 12:12.390
Whoa, that's been
my dream for two years.

12:12.425 --> 12:13.992
And now it's all coming true.

12:13.993 --> 12:15.527
So, do we have a deal?

12:15.528 --> 12:17.029
(nervous groaning)

12:17.030 --> 12:18.530
Okay.
Great.

12:18.531 --> 12:20.132
Now, Tina, no more freaking out.

12:20.133 --> 12:21.533
Just press your feelings

12:21.534 --> 12:24.489
into a tight little
diamond and sparkle.

my birthday party.

12:30.944 --> 12:33.111

to uninvite you.

12:33.146 --> 12:34.646

Yeah.

12:34.647 --> 12:35.848
It's a reverse-vitation.

12:35.849 --> 12:37.209
You have a minus
one to this party.

12:37.217 --> 12:38.349
Wait, why?

12:38.384 --> 12:39.785
Because Tammy said.

12:39.786 --> 12:42.020
You're like a kiss narc now.
Hello!

12:42.021 --> 12:43.789
How can we trust
Miss No Kissing not to

12:43.790 --> 12:44.890
(whispering):
rat out a kissing party?

12:44.891 --> 12:46.058
I don't really hate kissing.

12:46.059 --> 12:47.192
I'm just playing a part.

12:47.193 --> 12:48.894
Okay, but I'm playing
a part where

12:48.895 --> 12:50.562
I uninvite you to my party,

12:50.563 --> 12:51.797
and I'm really good at it.

12:51.798 --> 12:53.298
You are.
You're really believable.

12:53.299 --> 12:54.399
I know.

12:54.400 --> 12:56.301
I'm like so good at this role.

12:56.302 --> 12:58.504

12:58.505 --> 13:00.171
Permanent soloist.

13:00.206 --> 13:01.740

13:01.741 --> 13:03.141

13:03.176 --> 13:04.576

13:04.577 --> 13:05.877
Permanent soloist!

13:05.912 --> 13:07.679
Oh, good, you're here.

13:07.680 --> 13:08.814
I got Gretchen to loan me

13:08.815 --> 13:10.649
the Wine Shoe back for 24 hours.

13:10.650 --> 13:12.417
We got to work on
our pitch for the Fischoeders.

13:12.418 --> 13:13.919
They're coming
tomorrow afternoon.

13:13.920 --> 13:15.153
Okay, Gene, write these down.

13:15.188 --> 13:16.188
All right.

13:16.189 --> 13:18.190
Um, Mer-loafers.
Mm-hmm.

13:18.191 --> 13:19.591
Sauvingnon Blahniks.

13:19.592 --> 13:20.791
Mom, listen to me.

13:20.827 --> 13:22.494
We need to sell Wine Shoe

13:22.495 --> 13:24.263
as a journey, not a product.

13:24.264 --> 13:26.765
We got to tell them a story
and if that fails,

13:26.766 --> 13:27.866
you have to cry.

13:27.867 --> 13:29.568
Huh, all right, okay.

13:29.569 --> 13:31.270
Uh, the story is...

13:31.271 --> 13:32.604
Wine Shoes...

13:32.605 --> 13:34.239
go together...

13:34.240 --> 13:35.541
like wine...

13:35.542 --> 13:36.775
Good so far.

13:36.776 --> 13:38.209
Y... sometimes, you just need

13:38.244 --> 13:39.844
a little wine in your shoe...

13:39.879 --> 13:41.547
to get through...
Wait, you could do, uh,

13:41.548 --> 13:43.048
Cinderella.
Yes!

13:43.049 --> 13:45.249
Like, oh, where
does this shoe fit?

13:45.285 --> 13:46.952
On a bottle of wine.

13:46.953 --> 13:48.921
The one you've been waiting
for your whole life.

13:48.922 --> 13:50.856
Finally, you found
your Prince Charming,

13:50.857 --> 13:52.757
and it's a bottle of wine.

13:52.792 --> 13:54.893
Oh, my God, Bobby,
I'm transported.

13:54.894 --> 13:56.228
Dad, you son of a bitch.

13:56.229 --> 13:58.029

beautiful bottle of wine

14:36.069 --> 14:39.271
in all the land...
but alas, I have no place

14:39.272 --> 14:40.738
to display it.

14:40.773 --> 14:41.772
Hark.

14:41.774 --> 14:43.308
Ooh, I wasn't expecting that.

14:43.309 --> 14:44.576
Excuse me, fair maiden,

14:44.577 --> 14:46.245
but I couldn't help but notice

14:46.246 --> 14:48.447
that you may have dropped
this shoe at my castle.

14:48.448 --> 14:49.615
I did?

14:49.616 --> 14:51.283
I am going from home to home

14:51.284 --> 14:52.985
seeing what this
shoe could fit on.

14:52.986 --> 14:55.454
Oh, it looks too
big for me, alas.

14:55.455 --> 14:56.655
But wait!

14:56.656 --> 14:59.424
What if the shoe fits
on the wine?

14:59.425 --> 15:01.092

15:01.127 --> 15:02.261
We'll fund your play.

15:02.262 --> 15:03.528

be great if you...

15:05.164 --> 15:06.331
Oh, no, no, no.

15:06.332 --> 15:07.599
Uh, we're not selling the play,

15:07.600 --> 15:08.600
we're selling this.

15:08.601 --> 15:10.002

15:10.003 --> 15:13.171
Gentleman, today we are
offering you a 50% stake

15:13.172 --> 15:14.739
in our company, Wine Shoe,

15:14.774 --> 15:17.342
for the low price of $1,000.

15:17.343 --> 15:18.944
Never more will
your wine look lame,

15:18.945 --> 15:20.879
sitting there on
the counter like an idiot.

15:20.880 --> 15:22.648
Pinot gross-i-o!

15:22.649 --> 15:25.317

factor with Wine Shoe.

15:25.318 --> 15:26.317
Ah!

15:26.319 --> 15:28.720
So... you did not call me

15:28.721 --> 15:31.355
over here to give me rent money?

15:31.391 --> 15:32.391
Okay, so you're out.

15:32.392 --> 15:33.591
Felix, what do you say?

15:33.626 --> 15:35.127
Well, I have had some businesses

15:35.128 --> 15:36.128
like this in the past.

15:36.129 --> 15:37.863
I founded Light-Tights,

15:37.864 --> 15:39.564
the tights with the light-up
fannies. I have those.

15:39.565 --> 15:41.465
I'm afraid, however,
that Wine Shoe...

15:41.501 --> 15:42.334
Wha-wha-what?

15:42.335 --> 15:43.702
...just doesn't speak to me.

15:43.703 --> 15:45.504
What?!
Yeah, sorry, Linda,

15:45.505 --> 15:46.637
but it's a no.

15:46.673 --> 15:48.539
Oh, come on...
Mom!

15:48.574 --> 15:50.242
(whining)

15:50.243 --> 15:51.376
What?
(whispering): Cry.

15:51.377 --> 15:52.878
Oh, oh, right, right, right.

15:52.879 --> 15:55.112
(crying)
Look what you did to my mom.

15:55.148 --> 15:56.715
(Linda wailing)
Should we sneak out?

15:56.716 --> 15:57.849
Yes.

15:57.850 --> 15:58.850
Here we go, sneaking out.

15:58.851 --> 15:59.850
BOTH: Sneak...

15:59.852 --> 16:01.253
sneak, sneak, sneak.

16:01.254 --> 16:02.653
Ugh.
Aw, nuts!

16:02.689 --> 16:05.157
LINDA:
<i>I don't know what went wrong.</i>

16:05.158 --> 16:06.758
I thought I could sell anything.

16:06.759 --> 16:08.326
I really thought
I'd get my dream.

16:08.361 --> 16:10.062
Dreams are dumb!
They ruin your life!

16:10.063 --> 16:11.663
What?
Tell me about it!

16:11.664 --> 16:13.531
I'll never be the Royal Baby.

16:13.566 --> 16:15.299
Can I finish my dinner
in my room?

16:15.335 --> 16:16.334
Uh, sure.

16:16.336 --> 16:17.401
(groaning)

16:17.437 --> 16:19.004
(Linda sighs)

16:19.005 --> 16:20.505
I guess I'll go talk to her.

16:20.506 --> 16:22.374
No, Lin, you're still
sad about your shoes.

16:22.375 --> 16:23.375
I'll-I'll go.

16:23.376 --> 16:24.375
All right.

16:24.377 --> 16:26.511
(crying)

16:26.512 --> 16:28.546
Uh, Tina, can, uh, can we talk?

16:28.581 --> 16:30.916
Still got that spaghetti, huh?

16:30.917 --> 16:32.017
Yeah.

16:32.018 --> 16:33.018
That's good.

16:33.019 --> 16:34.453
We'll wash the sheets later.

16:34.454 --> 16:35.920
Okay.
Look...

16:35.955 --> 16:37.756
you are obviously upset.

16:37.757 --> 16:39.924
I-is... is it about
your puberty show?

16:39.959 --> 16:40.892
Kinda.

16:40.893 --> 16:42.094
You want to tell me about it?

16:42.095 --> 16:44.196
Okay, but if I tell you

16:44.197 --> 16:46.031
then I'm telling you
another kid's secret.

16:46.032 --> 16:47.299
Do you swear not to tell?

16:47.300 --> 16:49.101
I think so...
as long as it's not...

16:49.102 --> 16:50.402
murder.

16:50.403 --> 16:51.803
It's not.
Good.

16:51.804 --> 16:53.372
Well, there was gonna be

16:53.373 --> 16:54.773
45 minutes of spin the bottle

16:54.774 --> 16:55.774
at Jocelyn's party...

16:55.775 --> 16:56.775
Okay...

16:56.776 --> 16:58.043
...but I got uninvited

16:58.044 --> 16:59.211
because now I'm Mona Nucleosis,

16:59.212 --> 17:00.711
the face of anti-kissing!

17:00.747 --> 17:03.047
Oh, uh, that sounds bad, yeah.

17:03.082 --> 17:05.384
And Mr. Frond told me I could
be the new permanent soloist,

17:05.385 --> 17:06.885
but if I do the show tomorrow

17:06.886 --> 17:08.787
no one will ever want
to kiss me ever again.

17:08.788 --> 17:10.655
Okay, first of all,
people will want

17:10.656 --> 17:11.923
to kiss you again, Tina.

17:11.924 --> 17:13.625
Really?
Yup. Boys?

17:13.626 --> 17:14.326
Yup.

17:14.327 --> 17:15.426
Huh. What do they look like?

17:15.428 --> 17:17.027
I-it's a hypothetical, it's...

17:17.063 --> 17:17.829
Tan?

17:17.829 --> 17:19.696
Yes, they're tan boys.

17:19.732 --> 17:21.233
But not like
that orange-y self-tan.

17:21.233 --> 17:24.002
Nope. Anyway,
I know puberty positivity

17:24.002 --> 17:26.405
is important to you
and that's good but

17:26.406 --> 17:28.173
if doing this play
is making you say

17:28.174 --> 17:29.775
something you don't
believe in, then maybe,

17:29.776 --> 17:31.076
you shouldn't do it.

17:31.077 --> 17:32.476
Even if I said I would?

17:32.512 --> 17:34.513
Yeah, because whether
you kiss anyone or not,

17:34.514 --> 17:37.115
you're in charge
of your own... mouth.

17:37.116 --> 17:39.284
Who you kiss with it
and what you say with it.

17:39.285 --> 17:40.284
And, Tina?

17:40.286 --> 17:41.520
Are you gonna say you

17:41.521 --> 17:42.754
have to tell on Jocelyn's party?

17:42.755 --> 17:44.656
No, I was going to ask you if

17:44.657 --> 17:47.091
you wanted me to get
you a handful of ice cream.

17:47.126 --> 17:48.492
(students chattering quietly)

17:48.528 --> 17:50.094
FROND: <i>All right,</i>

17:51.164 --> 17:52.797
I'll see you on the other side.

17:55.601 --> 17:56.835
<i>It's my mouth.</i>

17:56.836 --> 17:58.537
Okay, everybody,
let's do this thing.

17:58.538 --> 18:00.070
Just be advised I've made some
changes to the end of the show,

18:00.106 --> 18:02.994
try to keep up.
There's our cue, let's go.

18:03.863 --> 18:08.041
Oh, no! I am afraid this
student, Mona, is dying.

18:08.042 --> 18:09.541
Dying from mononucleosis.

18:09.577 --> 18:11.411
Nurse, I need you
to write something down.

18:11.412 --> 18:12.945
Yes, Doctor?

you'll be kissing is
