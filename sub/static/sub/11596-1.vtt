<i>The vineyards currently take up
over thirty thousand acres,</i>

03:47.160 --> 03:50.243
where we grow five
different varieties of wine,

03:50.400 --> 03:54.724
Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Shiraz,
CarmÃ©nere, and Sauvignon Blanc.

03:54.920 --> 03:58.242
Now please follow me
and watch your step.

04:01.840 --> 04:03.888
I hate your gringo friend.

04:04.040 --> 04:05.849
Right now, so do I.

04:09.280 --> 04:14.207
Centuries ago huge festivals were held
at the end of the grape harvest.

04:14.360 --> 04:17.204
And the virgins of the different
towns would stomp the grapes

04:17.399 --> 04:20.688
to make the wine. As you have
seen today now it's a much more

04:20.839 --> 04:22.888
sophisticated process.

04:23.040 --> 04:25.884
Do you have any questions?
No?

04:26.040 --> 04:29.965
OK, feel free to look around
and take pictures.

04:30.160 --> 04:32.162
Actually I have a question,

04:32.320 --> 04:33.731
can you take a photo of me
and my friends?

04:33.880 --> 04:34.961
- Sure.
- Thanks.

04:35.120 --> 04:36.326
Just push right there.

04:36.480 --> 04:38.209
- Halfway to focus.
- OK.

04:38.360 --> 04:40.442
Gentlemen? Come on.

04:40.600 --> 04:43.080
- I can't move, por favor.
- Yeah, I'm good here.

04:43.240 --> 04:45.561
<i>Ariel, one photo
for the mishbuka.</i>

04:45.760 --> 04:46.966
Come on.

04:48.600 --> 04:49.806
Say wine!

04:49.960 --> 04:51.724
Wine.

05:01.960 --> 05:04.725
Everybody please,
before you taste the wine,

05:04.880 --> 05:08.805
take a moment and try to find
the different aromas in this Cabernet.

05:33.160 --> 05:34.605
Yeah, it's OK.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.247
Chi!

05:37.440 --> 05:38.566
- Le.
- Le.

05:38.720 --> 05:39.881
Chichichi!
Lelele!

05:40.040 --> 05:41.087
Viva Chile!

05:43.000 --> 05:44.161
<i>L'chaim!</i>

05:57.080 --> 05:59.003
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

05:59.160 --> 06:03.802
Last time I was here I tried
a delicious Cabernet.

06:03.960 --> 06:06.327
And I haven't been able
to find it anywhere.

06:06.480 --> 06:09.529
I took a picture of the label...

06:11.760 --> 06:13.171
Wait.

06:13.320 --> 06:15.049
Can you show me the last picture?

06:17.120 --> 06:19.521
Is that the RZA?

06:19.680 --> 06:21.444
Who?

06:22.200 --> 06:24.202
RZA... He's a good friend of mine.

06:24.400 --> 06:25.970
I need to call him.

06:26.120 --> 06:30.011
He wanted to come in January, but there
aren't available venues till November.

06:31.600 --> 06:35.366
Are you organizing a
Wu-Tang Clan concert in Chile?

06:35.520 --> 06:37.488
Not me, my company.

06:51.840 --> 06:53.171
Hey, stop it.

06:53.320 --> 06:55.163
You unfollowed her
for a reason.

06:55.320 --> 06:57.084
I just want to know if she
tweeted that guy again.

06:57.240 --> 06:59.368
Dude, you don't have x-ray
vision to see her DM's.

06:59.560 --> 07:02.928
No, but I know her well enough
to know what she's not saying.

07:03.080 --> 07:04.969
Last time I was single
you met a girl and got her email.

07:05.120 --> 07:08.408
Now I feel like every girl I meet
I have to download some new app.

07:08.560 --> 07:11.609
Whatever happened to meeting a girl
in the park and saying hey...

07:11.760 --> 07:12.761
...how about a cup of coffee?

07:17.280 --> 07:19.647
Don't worry, Gringo,
we're taking you to a nice park

07:19.800 --> 07:21.370
where you can ask
a girl for coffee.

07:21.520 --> 07:22.601
Trust me.

08:15.440 --> 08:17.442
Here's your coffee.

08:18.880 --> 08:22.123
<i>Gracias, Sefior.</i>

08:30.960 --> 08:32.325
<i>PetaÃ±as.</i>

08:37.360 --> 08:38.725
<i>Labios.</i>

08:50.600 --> 08:52.011
Sorry.

08:52.160 --> 08:55.243
Oh, it's my daughter.

08:55.400 --> 08:59.041
Hang on, baby, I'm at a party,
it's very loud, just a second.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.281
I have to go.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.283
Please... I just gotta talk to her.

09:02.440 --> 09:05.444
I have to talk to her.
She's in California.

09:05.600 --> 09:08.126
<i>Un minuto. Dos minuto.</i>

09:10.120 --> 09:12.885
Gracias. I'm coming, sweetie!
It's just really loud right here.

09:13.040 --> 09:14.485
Just a second, baby!

09:16.120 --> 09:17.406
Hey, honey!

09:17.560 --> 09:19.642
<i>Hi, Daddy!
When are you coming home?</i>

09:19.800 --> 09:22.326
I'll be home in two days.
Sooner than you think.

09:27.480 --> 09:29.130
Hey, what about your sister?

09:29.280 --> 09:30.770
The further away the better.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.164
Kylie!

09:35.880 --> 09:37.245
Kylie!

09:47.080 --> 09:49.048
- <i>Bye, Daddy, Tom's here.</i>
- <i>Who?</i>

09:49.200 --> 09:51.362
<i>Mommy's new boyfriend!
Bye!</i>

10:02.520 --> 10:03.521
Fuck!

10:06.600 --> 10:07.761
Next.

10:10.800 --> 10:12.040
Next.

10:13.240 --> 10:14.890
Next.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.163
No, we're having so much fun.
I'll call you when I get back.

10:22.320 --> 10:24.163
OK. Love you.

10:24.320 --> 10:25.890
<i>HEY-</i>

10:26.040 --> 10:27.530
You're American?

10:27.680 --> 10:29.364
- Yes.
- That's really...

10:29.560 --> 10:30.846
I'm... Obviously me too.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.684
I'm from... Where you from?

10:32.840 --> 10:35.127
- Los Angeles.
- I'm from San Diego.

10:36.520 --> 10:37.806
That was a crazy flight here, right?

10:37.960 --> 10:41.442
That was like 12 hours, did you
come here for the concert?

10:41.600 --> 10:43.125
No.

10:43.720 --> 10:45.927
Oh, I didn't either.
I came to visit some friends.

10:46.120 --> 10:49.010
They kinda took me here. But this
is crazy, right? It's really cool.

10:49.160 --> 10:50.241
Umm...

10:51.640 --> 10:54.371
I don't have... Uh...
I don't have any cards,

10:54.520 --> 10:57.091
but, um,
if you're ever in San Diego.

10:58.720 --> 11:00.245
If I'm ever in San Diego, what?

11:01.360 --> 11:05.604
If you're ever in San Diego,
um, there's an awesome zoo.

11:08.680 --> 11:09.681
Hi.

11:10.600 --> 11:12.329
I have a boyfriend.

11:12.520 --> 11:14.727
Oh, that's really cool.
You guys... is he here?

11:14.880 --> 11:17.121
- You guys been together for a long...
- We're done, thanks.

11:18.360 --> 11:20.931
Cool... Nice meeting you.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.482
Don't you ever leave
my side again.

11:30.640 --> 11:32.483
OK, I thought you
were behind us.

11:32.640 --> 11:33.926
Names?

11:34.080 --> 11:36.526
Oh, we're on the list.
A guy put us on there.

11:36.680 --> 11:38.682
It was a foreign name,
'cause we're not from here.

11:38.880 --> 11:41.167
It was something like,
you know... Pedro...

11:41.320 --> 11:43.368
- Full name?
- ...Pablo... Yeah.

11:43.520 --> 11:44.521
Full name.

11:44.720 --> 11:47.405
OK. I'm Kylie, this is Irina.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.125
- Hello.
- What's your name?

11:50.160 --> 11:51.241
Full name.

11:54.840 --> 11:55.841
Next.

11:58.320 --> 11:59.481
- Next.
- Next.

12:01.560 --> 12:02.971
Like!

12:03.120 --> 12:04.281
Isn't that the
girl from last night?

12:04.440 --> 12:05.521
Yeah, yeah, let me check.

12:05.680 --> 12:08.889
Yeah, it's the same.
Antonio!

12:16.160 --> 12:17.525
Hi!

12:17.680 --> 12:19.125
I mean, why should I stay?

12:19.280 --> 12:21.521
All the clubs here are the same
as everywhere else.

12:21.680 --> 12:23.364
Same people, same DJ's...

12:23.520 --> 12:25.090
Same hipster music.

12:25.240 --> 12:28.050
I thought South America was
going to be like third-world.

12:28.200 --> 12:30.407
But like, cool third-world.
You know, like Bali.

12:30.600 --> 12:33.444
Well, it is if you know
where to go.

12:33.600 --> 12:34.886
The best parties are hidden.

12:35.040 --> 12:37.611
There's one party tomorrow night
in Valparaiso.

12:38.560 --> 12:40.369
That's the real Chile.

12:40.520 --> 12:42.363
People think Chile is like
<i>City</i> of God or something.

12:42.520 --> 12:45.524
Or like Juarez, like there's
bodies hanging in the streets.

12:45.680 --> 12:48.809
This place is awesome! It's like the
indie station of Latin America.

12:48.960 --> 12:52.851
It's like really cool,
the food here is so fresh.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.485
There's no preservatives
in anything.

12:54.640 --> 12:55.971
I'm sorry.

13:05.880 --> 13:06.881
We actually could stay.

13:07.040 --> 13:09.441
The only problem is my sister.

13:10.360 --> 13:14.046
- That girl is your sister?
- Technically yes, same dad.

13:14.200 --> 13:17.124
It's not like I know her, she
was off with her mom in Hungary.

13:17.280 --> 13:18.884
She's a real pain in the ass.

13:19.040 --> 13:22.726
So, I forgave her. But then
she fucked this other guy.

13:22.880 --> 13:25.770
I don't understand why
she keeps texting me.

13:25.920 --> 13:29.288
Look what she just sent to me.
Look.

13:29.440 --> 13:31.442
I know it's in Spanish,
but you get the point, right?

13:31.600 --> 13:33.409
- Right.
- Excuse me.

13:34.400 --> 13:35.765
I can translate it for you.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.125
- You're kidding me?
- It's champagne.

13:40.280 --> 13:41.611
I don't make the rules.

13:41.760 --> 13:43.967
No, you enforce them
which is worse.

13:44.120 --> 13:47.203
- Too bad.
- Hey, don't worry.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.681
When you're 21 you can drink
without anyone's permission.

13:49.840 --> 13:52.923
I am 21. I don't need
anybody's permission.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.409
Good girl.

14:09.520 --> 14:12.251
Your boyfriend?

14:13.720 --> 14:15.404
No. My son.

14:16.520 --> 14:18.010
- I have a daughter.
- I'm not surprised.

14:18.160 --> 14:20.208
Really, why is that?

14:20.360 --> 14:22.567
Because, you're dressed
like a dad.

14:22.720 --> 14:25.291
Fuck you.

14:25.440 --> 14:27.442
Check this out, I looked
like this when we met.

14:29.360 --> 14:32.648
- That's you?
- True story.

14:32.800 --> 14:35.565
- When did you lose it?
- A year ago.

14:36.600 --> 14:38.489
That's when she started liking me.

14:38.640 --> 14:40.927
She's so superficial.

14:41.080 --> 14:44.323
Monica! Monica! Pollo just
invited us to Valparaiso.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.130
What are you talking about?

14:46.320 --> 14:47.651
I'm talking about the
coolest thing in Chile.

14:47.800 --> 14:50.451
- There's a huge party.
- We're leaving tomorrow.

14:50.600 --> 14:54.889
Valparaiso is a really nice place.
It's made of human skin.

14:55.080 --> 14:57.890
- What?
- Scale, Ariel. Human scale.

14:58.080 --> 15:00.003
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

15:00.160 --> 15:02.162
Human scale.
You don't need a car,

15:02.320 --> 15:04.243
you can walk everywhere.
It's great.

15:04.400 --> 15:05.890
Come on, Monica.
Pollo changed our tickets.

15:06.040 --> 15:08.646
He upgraded us to business class.
It's done.

15:09.280 --> 15:11.567
Kylie!

15:11.760 --> 15:14.047
You can't just change plans.
You have to consult me.

15:14.200 --> 15:15.725
What's your fucking problem?

15:15.880 --> 15:17.564
It's just one night
and we're out of coach.

15:17.720 --> 15:19.051
It's so close, let's go see it.

15:19.200 --> 15:21.567
No, no. You're coming
back with me tomorrow.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.243
No. I can do whatever I want.

15:26.720 --> 15:29.246
No, you can't.
As you've repeatedly proven.

15:30.080 --> 15:32.890
OK, let's see what Daddy
has to say about it.

15:33.880 --> 15:35.689
Ooooh.

15:38.560 --> 15:41.166
Listen... Sofia... Monica.

15:41.320 --> 15:42.810
You have nothing to worry about.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.889
Pollo's dad owns a boutique
hotel in Valparaiso.

15:45.040 --> 15:47.520
It's a really nice place...
and it's very safe.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.047
Housing is the least
of my concerns.

15:52.360 --> 15:54.362
It doesn't matter anyway.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.443
There's no way our
dad would let her go.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.804
Daddy would like a word.

16:02.560 --> 16:03.766
Hello?

16:39.760 --> 16:42.684
OK, guys!
Welcome to Valparaiso city.

16:42.840 --> 16:44.808
I'm Ariel. Or Ariel for you.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.724
First of all, we're going to eat.

16:46.880 --> 16:50.885
There's a great restaurant round
the corner. Great shellfish.

16:51.040 --> 16:52.690
I know it's not Kosher.

16:52.840 --> 16:54.365
- We have chicken for you.
- OK, good, thank you.

17:06.079 --> 17:09.367
Who wants ice cream?!

17:19.079 --> 17:22.209
- Kylie. Kylie.
- Hold on. Hold on.

17:26.040 --> 17:28.725
Hey! Don Pollo!

17:43.520 --> 17:46.046
I used to play this
song with my band.

17:46.720 --> 17:48.290
Muscle Rock.

17:52.640 --> 17:56.531
It just came to me...
in a dream.

19:25.400 --> 19:26.447
Let's go.

19:32.240 --> 19:33.924
Isn't there another way, like steps?

19:34.080 --> 19:36.128
It's a quick ride
and it's beautiful. Come on.

19:37.960 --> 19:40.247
Hey, Monica, it's only
a hundred years old, look.

19:52.920 --> 19:55.002
- Why is that?
- It's because we're Jews.

19:55.160 --> 19:56.161
No, no, wait, wait.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.288
Dude, it's 30 seconds.
We'll take the Jew car.

19:58.440 --> 20:00.090
Yeah, we didn't want to ride
with you guys anyway.

20:00.240 --> 20:02.925
- Yeah, fuck you guys.
- No, waiting is for poor people.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.325
Let's go.

20:11.520 --> 20:14.126
- <i>Muchas gracias.</i>
- <i>Gracias.</i>

20:22.680 --> 20:24.444
What did he say?

20:24.600 --> 20:26.170
Have a nice trip.

20:35.200 --> 20:38.761
Check it out.
This is just stunning.

20:38.960 --> 20:40.041
I can't believe you guys
almost missed this.

20:40.200 --> 20:41.565
This is the Chile
I wanted to experience.

20:41.760 --> 20:44.206
I know, right?

20:47.760 --> 20:51.367
Wow! These are
really cool fave/as.

20:51.560 --> 20:53.130
I want one for my backyard.

20:53.280 --> 20:56.090
Honey, I'll buy you a favela.
Poor people included.

20:58.600 --> 21:00.250
- Like the view?
- Yeah.

21:07.080 --> 21:10.209
Christ!
What the fuck, Pollo.

21:10.360 --> 21:11.725
What's going on?

21:12.560 --> 21:15.564
- Is this part of it?
- I don't know.

21:25.440 --> 21:27.204
<i>Hola.</i>

21:27.360 --> 21:30.409
Hola!

21:30.600 --> 21:34.366
We're not going to fall down, it's OK.
Come on. Right?

21:36.240 --> 21:37.287
<i>Hola!</i>

21:42.320 --> 21:44.004
<i>Gracias!</i>

21:44.160 --> 21:46.003
I wasn't scared.

21:51.560 --> 21:54.325
That was exciting.
Well done, Pollo.

21:54.480 --> 21:57.211
That's awesome.
Jews are not meant for tragedy.

21:57.360 --> 21:59.089
We don't handle it well.

22:08.960 --> 22:12.567
- Say "dead bodies!"
- Dead bodies!

22:12.720 --> 22:15.769
Another message from Sofia.

22:15.920 --> 22:17.763
You want to know what it says?

22:20.560 --> 22:25.122
- Stay back.
- My hero!

22:41.600 --> 22:43.489
Hey, what does that say?

22:44.280 --> 22:45.441
It says....

22:45.600 --> 22:48.046
"Beware, dead babies."

22:48.200 --> 22:49.201
That's not funny.

22:49.360 --> 22:51.328
Pollo, no baby jokes.

22:52.800 --> 22:56.168
It says, don't be afraid,
I am with you.

22:56.320 --> 22:59.244
They created this monument
for all the orphans who died.

22:59.440 --> 23:01.920
People come here all the time
to make wishes.

23:02.080 --> 23:04.208
I don't get it, why were
there so many orphans?

23:04.400 --> 23:06.084
You see that church?

23:06.280 --> 23:08.521
They say that the priests
and the nuns

23:08.680 --> 23:10.045
would meet to have sex
in secret tunnels.

23:10.240 --> 23:14.131
And when they got pregnant,
they buried the babies under here.

23:14.280 --> 23:16.806
- Ugh.
- Do those tunnels still exist?

23:16.960 --> 23:19.964
I don't know, but there's a short cut
to the church down that way.

23:20.120 --> 23:22.930
- Let's go.
- I'm not going into the tunnels.

23:23.720 --> 23:25.006
OK.

23:35.720 --> 23:38.326
<i>Hey, Gringo,
if you want to fuck this girl,</i>

23:38.520 --> 23:40.488
you need a little bit
more than hair gel.

23:40.640 --> 23:42.483
This is what I look like when I go out.

23:42.640 --> 23:45.769
Hey, I'm team Gringo, OK?
I'm helping you.

23:45.920 --> 23:48.571
Look, if there's one thing I learned
from my asshole dad,

23:48.720 --> 23:50.404
is that lying works.

23:50.560 --> 23:52.130
I don't know,
tell her you can hook her up

23:52.320 --> 23:53.845
with your contacts in L.A.
or something like that.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.240
That girl's
pretty experienced.

23:55.400 --> 23:56.526
She's not going to fall
for that bullshit.

23:56.680 --> 23:58.205
Come on, Gringo.
They're all the same.

23:58.360 --> 24:00.089
They just want to be upgraded
to business class.

24:21.600 --> 24:22.726
- Hey!
- What?

24:22.880 --> 24:25.645
That's the girl from the vineyard!
The guide. The Wu-Tang girl.

24:25.800 --> 24:28.531
Yeah. Who do you think
put her on the list.

24:28.680 --> 24:30.603
Second lesson,
always have a plan B.

24:30.760 --> 24:32.171
I'm learning, Pollo.

24:46.160 --> 24:48.561
- Carmen!
- Pollo! Pollo, Pollo, Pollo!

24:50.120 --> 24:52.566
Where's the bathroom, please?
The baÃ±o?

24:54.760 --> 24:57.650
Don't let her drink, please.
It's not a joke.

24:57.800 --> 24:59.882
Thanks, Mom! We have it.

25:00.920 --> 25:02.046
Love you.

25:06.040 --> 25:07.644
Really fast. Really fast.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.211
Wait a second, OK?

25:34.000 --> 25:35.843
Oh...

25:38.840 --> 25:39.841
It's OK.

26:26.120 --> 26:29.090
I was thinking about the
energy of the universe.

26:29.240 --> 26:31.049
- What?
- The energy and how it brings

26:31.200 --> 26:35.524
people together, and there's really no
such thing as a coincidence.

26:35.680 --> 26:41.289
And my corporation, my law firm,
we just oversaw a corporate merger...

26:41.440 --> 26:43.010
What? Sorry?

26:43.200 --> 26:46.443
The merger, it's like a company
that we did the deal for,

26:46.600 --> 26:49.524
they bought a modeling agency
in Los Angeles.

26:49.680 --> 26:52.763
So now, randomly
I have all these contacts,

26:52.960 --> 26:57.045
- with these modeling agents.
- Pollo told you to say that?

26:58.760 --> 27:03.163
- No... It's coincidence.
- The business is full of idiots

27:03.320 --> 27:05.368
that think just because
I'm Russian I'm starving.

27:05.560 --> 27:09.087
Last year, I made a hundred
and fifty grand. How about you?

27:11.320 --> 27:14.608
You think it's too late
for me to become a model?

27:14.760 --> 27:16.967
Well, maybe you lose ten pounds

27:17.120 --> 27:21.011
and don't put so much gel in your hair.

27:21.200 --> 27:22.486
Maybe you have a chance.

27:26.480 --> 27:28.130
You think maybe I have a chance?

28:05.200 --> 28:07.851
Pollo! Pollo! Pollo!
You left me all alone!

28:08.040 --> 28:09.849
Oh, poor little thing.

28:20.280 --> 28:21.441
Let's go dance.

28:21.600 --> 28:23.409
- Phone...
- Bye!

28:37.520 --> 28:40.649
Russell!
Russell! Russell!

28:42.320 --> 28:45.005
- Who's this dude?
- I don't know!

28:48.360 --> 28:49.964
I think they're saying Russell!

29:32.120 --> 29:33.884
Russell Dazzle!

29:34.080 --> 29:37.527
P-P-P-P-Pollo, amigo!

29:43.040 --> 29:45.247
<i>Amigos.</i> International friends.

29:45.400 --> 29:47.243
This is the Russian princess, Irina.

29:52.280 --> 29:54.248
Please, pick up.

29:54.480 --> 29:57.290
- Hey, where is Kylie?
- Dancing. Dancing...

29:57.760 --> 29:59.250
Please, pick up.

30:08.800 --> 30:12.691
Irina is very pretty. Girlfriend?

30:14.160 --> 30:17.209
Uh, yeah, I mean it's new,
we haven't quite...

30:17.360 --> 30:19.442
...but it's pretty much on.

30:35.800 --> 30:40.567
- Oh! Gringo, Irina is very loca.
- That's hilarious...

30:40.720 --> 30:42.688
Oh. Here, here, here...

30:44.880 --> 30:47.884
- Bye-bye.
- Russell Dazzle.

30:48.040 --> 30:50.486
- He's amazing.
- Pollo, what the fuck?

30:50.640 --> 30:52.210
How's that helping Team Gringo?

30:53.720 --> 30:55.370
It's not my fault you're too
slow for this country.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.887
- Oh, fuck you.
- Fuck me?

30:58.080 --> 31:00.606
Come on, Gringo,
there's a million girls over there.

31:00.760 --> 31:03.525
Hey, look, look, look. The cleaning lady
isn't dancing with anyone.

31:03.680 --> 31:06.809
Oh, maybe I'll tell her my father owns
half the country, that seems to work.

31:08.040 --> 31:10.327
OK, Gringo, if you wanna get
fucked, then call your ex.

31:10.480 --> 31:13.086
- Nobody likes you here.
- Unlike you who everybody likes,

31:13.240 --> 31:16.005
clearly it has nothing to do
with your father's money.

31:17.600 --> 31:19.250
Look, Gringo,
I am not your buddy, OK?

31:19.400 --> 31:22.051
That's Ariel. So we don't need
to pretend we like each other.

31:22.200 --> 31:23.201
- I'm not pretending.
- Me neither.

31:23.400 --> 31:24.606
- Good.
- Good.

31:29.040 --> 31:30.371
What was that?

31:31.000 --> 31:32.286
Nothing.

31:32.440 --> 31:35.842
Oh, look at that, Russell Dazzle
really knows how to move.

32:02.160 --> 32:03.241
It's Red Bull!

32:04.400 --> 32:05.640
Just checking.

32:08.680 --> 32:10.444
Shit, Pollo!

32:14.080 --> 32:16.208
OK. We're outta here.

32:17.120 --> 32:18.326
I'm not going anywhere.

32:18.480 --> 32:20.881
Come on, Monica, relax.

32:21.080 --> 32:22.764
It's just a little pot,
she's not drinking.

32:22.960 --> 32:25.327
- You stay outta this.
- He's right, he's right.

32:25.480 --> 32:27.323
You said no drinking.

32:27.480 --> 32:30.689
Monica, you should take her home.
She's really out of control.

32:32.480 --> 32:34.482
Kylie, you're completely wasted.

32:35.720 --> 32:37.722
I'm taking you home. Now.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.121
No.

32:56.760 --> 32:58.205
I'm not standing here all night.

32:58.360 --> 33:00.601
I'm finally having fun
for the first time in months.

33:00.760 --> 33:03.206
And you want to ruin it for me.
You want me to be as miserable as you.

33:03.360 --> 33:04.930
That's not going to happen.

33:05.080 --> 33:07.526
I'm sorry if you're incapable
of having fun without drugs.

33:07.680 --> 33:10.365
- That's not my problem.
- So, what is your problem?

33:10.520 --> 33:12.921
Because you never gave a shit about me
until Daddy started paying you to.

33:13.080 --> 33:17.483
So go back to India, go back
to your tent. Go find yourself.

33:19.840 --> 33:22.161
You need to listen to me,
you're outta control.

33:22.320 --> 33:24.049
So, we're leaving now.

33:24.200 --> 33:27.409
No. I'm in control,
and you will listen to me.

33:27.560 --> 33:29.210
I can do whatever I want!

33:29.400 --> 33:31.641
I'll do all the coke in Chile!
I'll fuck any guy I want!

33:31.800 --> 33:33.689
- Stop it!
- I already fucked Pollo

33:33.840 --> 33:36.810
while you were in the bathroom,
and I sucked Gringo's cock!

33:38.160 --> 33:40.606
And you know what? I'm going to fuck
everybody in this club!

33:40.760 --> 33:42.330
Who here wants to fuck,
'cause I'm ready!

33:43.600 --> 33:45.489
- Are you through?
- Hardly.

33:45.640 --> 33:48.644
You want to know what Daddy said when
she went off to India to find herself?

33:48.800 --> 33:50.768
I hope she never comes back.

33:52.880 --> 33:55.406
I only came to Valparaiso
because I worry about you.

33:55.560 --> 33:57.244
But you don't give a fuck
about anyone else.

33:57.400 --> 34:00.529
You're a selfish, spoiled, little shit!

34:00.720 --> 34:03.041
I'm selfish?

34:03.200 --> 34:05.248
That's actually funny,
last I checked,

34:05.400 --> 34:08.404
you were the one who had an abortion
and got Daddy to pay for it!

34:47.560 --> 34:48.891
What the fuck!

35:00.800 --> 35:02.006
Help me!

35:31.800 --> 35:32.926
Everyone all right?

35:33.080 --> 35:36.687
- Are you OK?
- Where's Irina?

35:36.840 --> 35:38.285
Where's Ariel?

35:41.280 --> 35:43.487
Carmen! Carmen!

35:53.680 --> 35:54.841
Help me!

36:24.240 --> 36:25.366
Ariel!

36:45.840 --> 36:47.001
Carmen!

36:50.160 --> 36:51.161
Carmen!

36:54.240 --> 36:56.720
Ariel!

36:56.880 --> 36:59.247
- Ariel!
- Pollo!

37:01.960 --> 37:05.009
- Pollo told us not to move!
- It's over, come on!

37:05.200 --> 37:07.282
- Ariel!
- Ariel!

37:12.760 --> 37:13.886
Ariel!

37:15.320 --> 37:16.560
Please find it!

37:19.160 --> 37:20.924
Please! Please!

37:21.080 --> 37:23.447
Help! Help! Help!

37:25.360 --> 37:26.725
Monica!

37:29.360 --> 37:31.681
We gotta find his hand!

37:31.840 --> 37:33.080
We gotta stop the bleeding!

37:48.080 --> 37:49.445
- We have to go!
- No! No!

37:49.600 --> 37:51.887
Ariel! Ariel!

37:52.800 --> 37:54.768
I see it! I see it!

37:58.760 --> 38:01.650
She's got it! She's got it!
Let's go! Let's go!

38:01.840 --> 38:02.841
Let's go! Let's go!

39:00.880 --> 39:02.723
We're going to help you up
Ready?

39:02.880 --> 39:04.928
On three...
One, two, three!

39:05.080 --> 39:06.491
Come on, you can do it.

39:20.840 --> 39:22.444
Fuck! Go! Go!

39:36.840 --> 39:38.001
Pollo, where's the car?

39:39.320 --> 39:40.731
Over there, over there.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.685
- What the fuck do we do?!
- Let's calm down, OK?

40:09.120 --> 40:10.804
My dad!
My dad has a helicopter!

40:10.960 --> 40:12.450
He can take us out
in ten minutes, OK?

40:18.120 --> 40:20.407
Check your phones!
Check your phones for signal!

40:24.680 --> 40:26.205
Where's the hospital?

40:26.400 --> 40:28.562
It's on top of the hill, but I
don't know how to get there.

40:28.720 --> 40:29.846
We got to stop someone!

40:30.800 --> 40:32.211
Here comes someone!

40:44.080 --> 40:46.526
Stop!

40:46.680 --> 40:48.728
Stay with him!
We gotta find someone!

40:53.080 --> 40:55.765
He's going to lose consciousness.
He's losing too much blood.

40:55.920 --> 40:56.921
Hold it!

41:05.440 --> 41:08.728
- How do you feel?
- It only hurts when I laugh.

41:10.880 --> 41:12.609
There's a guy over there
who can help him!

41:12.760 --> 41:15.525
- Kylie!
- Sefior. Sefior. A hospital?

41:15.680 --> 41:16.761
A hospital?

41:17.680 --> 41:18.886
A hospital?

41:22.480 --> 41:24.801
The roads are completely blocked.
There's no cars anywhere.

41:27.720 --> 41:29.051
No!

41:34.440 --> 41:36.363
No! No! No! Dangerous!

41:48.880 --> 41:50.120
What the fuck is that?!

41:53.560 --> 41:54.561
What?!

41:54.720 --> 41:56.768
Tsunami! Tsunami!
Let's go, let's go!

41:59.560 --> 42:02.643
A fucking tsunami's
coming. Let's go!

42:28.760 --> 42:30.250
Wait here! Wait here! OK?

42:40.760 --> 42:44.765
Ariel! Get up!
Come on, get up!

43:02.480 --> 43:04.801
Come on! Walk!
Come on!

43:04.960 --> 43:06.086
Ariel...

43:07.120 --> 43:08.360
Pollo!

43:28.280 --> 43:31.841
He's dying!
He went unconscious.

43:32.040 --> 43:35.123
He passed out. We're losing him!
He's going to die.

43:44.720 --> 43:46.051
Jesus, please!

43:47.640 --> 43:49.483
<i>Por favor! Por favor!</i>

43:50.240 --> 43:52.527
He's dying! He's dying!

43:52.680 --> 43:55.604
I'm sorry...
I know I'm an asshole.

43:55.760 --> 43:59.526
Just don't take it out
on my friend, please.

43:59.680 --> 44:02.524
Please let him get to the hospital.

44:02.680 --> 44:05.968
Fine... But only him.

44:19.600 --> 44:22.843
Please, take my friend to the hospital.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.685
- Don't worry.
- Thanks a lot.

44:29.600 --> 44:31.762
Relax!

44:31.920 --> 44:33.968
Everything is gonna be okay.

44:34.120 --> 44:37.090
We'll find another way to the hospital.

44:37.240 --> 44:41.928
Every ten years we have tsunami
warnings. It never happens.

44:42.760 --> 44:45.240
Hey, two minutes, you'll be there.

45:07.280 --> 45:09.123
Here they come!
Here they come!

45:30.880 --> 45:33.281
What the fuck is going on?!

45:33.440 --> 45:36.046
- Calm down!
- He's there.

47:00.080 --> 47:01.491
Let it go.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.047
Pollo...

47:08.040 --> 47:13.126
Pollo, don't do it.
Don't do this! Pollo.

47:47.000 --> 47:48.490
Pollo.

47:51.200 --> 47:52.690
Pollo, come on.

48:01.840 --> 48:03.171
Pollo.

48:20.160 --> 48:22.288
Come on. Come on.

49:16.120 --> 49:17.531
Pollo...

49:23.360 --> 49:25.966
Pollo, we have to keep moving.

49:26.120 --> 49:28.361
Pollo, the tsunami's coming.
We have to keep moving.

49:43.440 --> 49:45.044
Pollo...

49:45.200 --> 49:48.488
I don't speak Spanish,
Pollo, none of us do.

49:48.640 --> 49:52.326
Nobody speaks Spanish.
We don't know where we are.

49:52.480 --> 49:55.370
We have to keep moving.
The tsunami's coming.

49:55.520 --> 49:58.330
It's not your fault, Pollo.
There's nothing we can do.

50:00.160 --> 50:01.605
Pollo, he was my friend too.

50:05.760 --> 50:07.649
You only knew him one summer.

50:09.200 --> 50:11.965
- I knew him my entire life.
- I know.

50:12.120 --> 50:15.681
It's all my fault.
I killed him.

50:15.840 --> 50:19.447
No, it's nobody's fault.
It's nobody's fault.

50:19.600 --> 50:24.561
We don't all have to die.
Pollo, without you...

50:24.720 --> 50:26.484
...we're going to die.

50:26.640 --> 50:29.644
I don't know where the fuck I am.
We don't speak Spanish.

50:29.800 --> 50:31.689
Please, the tsunami's coming.

50:31.880 --> 50:33.609
Pollo, stop it!
We have to go!

50:33.800 --> 50:36.371
Fucking tsunami's coming!
Let's go! Move!

50:36.520 --> 50:38.522
Now! Let's go!

50:48.000 --> 50:50.480
Monica! Monica.

51:26.440 --> 51:28.647
- What the fuck is going on?!
- It's a fucking madhouse.

51:41.240 --> 51:46.041
Monica. Hold my hand,
hold my hand. Hold my hand, OK?

51:46.200 --> 51:47.611
Look into my eyes!

51:47.760 --> 51:49.683
Look into my eyes.
Look into my eyes.

51:49.840 --> 51:51.808
Breathe, OK, breathe. Breathe...

51:52.000 --> 51:53.650
Breathe. Breathe.

51:56.720 --> 51:58.449
Breathe with me, OK?

52:04.400 --> 52:07.165
- Thank you.
- OK. OK.

52:10.160 --> 52:13.528
<i>Attention! The prison collapsed.
Inmates escaped.</i>

52:13.680 --> 52:17.730
<i>Curfew is in effect.
Go home or you will be arrested.</i>

52:20.800 --> 52:22.450
It's the police!
It's the police, we're safe!

52:22.600 --> 52:24.011
We're safe, OK.

52:45.840 --> 52:48.286
Ariel said there was
a shortcut through the cemetery.

52:48.440 --> 52:49.771
That way! Go! Go! Go!

52:52.160 --> 52:54.481
Look at those girls! Get 'em!

53:01.160 --> 53:03.242
Fuck! Run! Run!

53:04.320 --> 53:07.130
Hey, ladies, where you going?

53:48.040 --> 53:49.326
Come on!

54:08.320 --> 54:09.367
It's too heavy!

54:11.800 --> 54:13.723
We need a jack,
let's find a car!

54:13.880 --> 54:17.965
No! No! No! Don't leave me!
My daughter! Don't leave me!

54:18.120 --> 54:21.124
I'll stay with him!
Go find it! I'll stay here!

54:21.320 --> 54:22.845
- No, we stay together!
- No, I can't leave her!

54:23.000 --> 54:24.047
Just go with Pollo!

54:25.320 --> 54:28.403
Hey, we'll be right back, OK?
Let's go! Let's go!

54:36.720 --> 54:39.690
- Oh, my God!
- The other house!

54:50.520 --> 54:52.329
What are we going to do?

54:54.040 --> 54:57.203
It's OK. It's OK.

54:57.360 --> 54:58.964
Everything is going
to be all right.

54:59.120 --> 55:02.602
We'll be home with our kids soon.
You will see.

55:12.040 --> 55:14.122
Look.Look...

55:16.000 --> 55:17.889
My beautiful boy.

55:18.080 --> 55:22.130
He's not afraid of anything.
Barely three years old.

55:22.280 --> 55:24.123
He's my hero.

55:24.280 --> 55:26.487
He's...
he's like his mother.

55:34.040 --> 55:36.122
Guys, shh! Listen.

55:39.640 --> 55:40.846
It's them.

55:41.880 --> 55:43.211
You have to hide.

55:44.800 --> 55:47.371
- You have to...
- We can't leave you here.

55:47.520 --> 55:51.206
No... they'll take my money.
They'll take my money. Go...

55:51.360 --> 55:54.250
You... have to hide.

55:54.400 --> 55:56.323
- Let's go.
- Go... Go...

56:33.320 --> 56:34.765
Shit!

56:38.880 --> 56:41.201
Shut up!

56:41.360 --> 56:42.566
What's up, Marito?

56:42.720 --> 56:44.802
This motherfucker scared me.

56:48.160 --> 56:50.083
Look for
a jack or something!

56:50.240 --> 56:52.242
There's nothing!

56:52.400 --> 56:54.641
Wait, someone's coming!

56:54.800 --> 56:56.689
Hey! Hey!

56:58.480 --> 57:00.926
Stop! Stop!

57:01.080 --> 57:02.570
They have to stop!

57:02.720 --> 57:03.926
It's not stopping!

57:13.120 --> 57:14.281
Check his pockets.

57:16.040 --> 57:18.520
He's alive.

57:22.800 --> 57:24.689
This is useful.

57:25.840 --> 57:27.649
And this.

57:29.560 --> 57:31.528
And this.

57:40.680 --> 57:42.569
Where are the girls?

57:43.800 --> 57:45.245
I don't speak Spanish.

57:49.440 --> 57:51.283
Marito, translate for me.

57:53.840 --> 57:55.842
Girls? Where?

57:59.960 --> 58:03.806
They're getting a doctor... for me.

58:04.000 --> 58:06.571
- A doctor...
- I don't believe him.

58:07.960 --> 58:09.928
L-He's lying-

58:28.240 --> 58:30.402
Where are the girls?

58:30.560 --> 58:33.643
Help me, please, help me!

58:34.720 --> 58:35.846
Oh, my God...

58:40.960 --> 58:44.248
Please, help me get out of here.

58:44.800 --> 58:48.168
Break the wood.

58:54.240 --> 58:56.720
My partner is already dead.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.401
Break the wood
and get me out of here.

59:00.560 --> 59:02.688
I know you can do it.

59:05.800 --> 59:07.040
Oh! Please...

59:08.120 --> 59:09.690
Come here.

59:13.080 --> 59:15.686
Last chance, Gringo.

59:15.840 --> 59:17.524
Where are the girls?

59:17.680 --> 59:23.289
They're not here. They went for a
doctor. They're getting me a doctor.

59:23.440 --> 59:24.441
They're getting me a doctor.

59:26.080 --> 59:27.764
They're not here.
They're getting me a doctor.

59:32.880 --> 59:35.326
He doesn't want to talk.

59:39.960 --> 59:41.803
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

59:42.960 --> 59:43.961
Please don't! Don't!

59:48.000 --> 59:50.048
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:02.891
Where are they?

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:07.045
I have a daughter! I have a daughter,
please! I have a daughter!

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:08.929
He says he's got a daughter.

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:11.327
Tell him she's about
to become an orphan.

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:12.721
Shh!

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:42.525
Use this.

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:47.607
Use this to break the wood.

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:51.003
We can call an ambulance.
I'm not going to kill him.

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:56.044
Would you rather kill
two people than save one?

01:00:56.760 --> 01:01:00.890
I have a family.
Take the axe.

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:31.842
Do it now! He's dead!

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:49.129
Your friends. Where?

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:54.042
Not here!

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.690
Check if there are more
girls hiding around.

01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:57.330
No! No! No!

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:07.366
There is nobody here.

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:09.522
Leave us alone.

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:24.044
No!

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:25.201
Turn around!

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:26.930
No! Stop!

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:31.362
Shut up or I'll burn you alive!

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:37.127
Thank you, dear God!

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:44.601
- What is he saying?
- Prison... collapse.

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:48.610
Prisoners are everywhere.

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:51.001
They tried to steal the...

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.406
- Fire truck?
- Yes.

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.210
Oh, God, Kylie!
You got to help us!

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.128
You are going to hell, motherfucker!

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:48.531
There was another girl!

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:50.484
Go get her!

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:52.489
Besides you, Marito.

01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:54.648
Happy birthday, brother.

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:56.882
Enjoy.

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:01.927
No! No! No!

01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:19.091
Kylie!

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:24.361
How's Gringo?

01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:28.851
They burned him alive!

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.367
Irina! Irina, they have her!

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:34.205
We have to save her!
We have to go!

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:51.891
Oh, my God.

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:57.248
We got to do something.

01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:00.368
No, it's too dangerous.

01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:02.841
She's right.
It's very dangerous. Let's go.

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:09.291
I'm sick of this shit.

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:52.847
Marito. Marito.

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:58.801
Marito.

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:10.204
- Irina!
- Let's go! Let's go!

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:14.166
They killed, Marito!

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:25.006
Follow me!

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:30.368
Follow me!

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:50.248
- Stay right there.
- Please, open the door!

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:52.966
Step away from the gate!
Residents only!

01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:57.489
- Please, We need your help!
- We already have our share of troubles.

01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:59.688
Three of our friends are dead!

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:01.126
Get out of here!

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:03.726
Motherfucker! Let's go!

01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:05.166
Wait.

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:08.210
- What are you doing?
- They can stay in my house.

01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:11.762
We can't just let anyone in.
They could be prisoners!

01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:14.486
It happened to the people just down
the street, they raped three women.

01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:19.771
We are not criminals.
I'm a fireman.

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:22.002
Those rapists said the same thing.

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:26.882
We're not prisoners.
We don't have tattoos.

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:30.408
Look at me,
I don't have any tattoos!

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:33.006
That's what a prisoner would say.

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:36.323
I'm not risking my family.
I'm a single mother!

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:41.281
Nobody is gonna harm my children.

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:42.771
Get out now!

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:46.845
You don't own the street, Mrs. Martinez!

01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:52.080
No one is going to tell me
what I can do!

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:55.961
I'm tired of your paranoia!

01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:58.011
Come in.

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:01.567
- Close the gate.
- Put down that gun.

01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:04.205
Come in.

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:06.761
If you come in, I'll kill you!

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.604
What did you do?

01:08:23.359 --> 01:08:26.886
- We have to go faster! Hurry up!
- We can't go any faster!

01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:30.970
- They're gonna catch us!
- Yes, yes. Yes, she is right.

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:33.122
We're too slow. Wait here.

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:42.401
OK, come. Come.
Come. Now! Now! Come!

01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:45.086
We hide him and find help.

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:50.844
- We'll be back when it's safe.
- Please don't leave me.

01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:56.366
Shh...

01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:57.680
Shut up.

01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:00.411
We will come back for you.

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:01.925
Don't make any noise.

01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:04.410
No! Kylie!

01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:08.167
Pollo, we're coming back
for you, I promise!

01:09:08.319 --> 01:09:09.731
Go! Go!

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:43.968
<i>Son... where are you?
I can't hear you.</i>

01:09:44.479 --> 01:09:49.361
Dad, I'm in Valparaiso.
You need to come for us.

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:50.930
Fuck.

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:18.889
Say hello to my brother, motherfucker.

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:49.930
Father, open the door.

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:52.205
Get away, please.

01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:55.489
Father, you know me.
I'm Ramon.

01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:58.371
You baptized me.

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:03.884
We're just trying to stop
the gringos that murdered Marito.

01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:07.840
It was self defense.

01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:11.926
Father, please open the door,
we're not gonna harm you.

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:16.644
We just wanna turn them
over to the justice.

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:19.201
Please, don't do it.
They want to kill us.

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:22.287
Open the fucking door!

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:24.201
Do you think they're dead?

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:26.441
Shh...

01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:30.321
Nothing.

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:34.645
Follow me.

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:39.404
What is he saying?

01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.449
The... the tunnel... The exit.

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:43.489
No, no. Can't we just wait here?

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:45.210
I'm not going to wait
for another aftershock!

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:49.282
- Is this going to hold us?
- Wait.

01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:51.371
I go first.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.764
It's OK!

01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:15.325
Come on!

01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:20.491
I'm gonna check the tunnel.

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:24.409
No, no, no. Go.

01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:51.843
My leg! My leg!

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.480
- My leg! My leg!
- Kylie!

01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:59.850
- Kylie!
- My leg! Something stuck!

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.604
Fucking something
sticking out of me!

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:03.967
- He's dead.
- Help!

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:08.531
We need to take it out.

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:14.846
I need to see, OK? I need to see.

01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:22.203
- Stop! Stop! Stop!
- OK!

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:27.123
I can't walk! I can't walk!

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:31.042
Look at me,
I will count to three.

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:38.089
Shh... One.

01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:40.009
Two.

01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:43.565
Three!

01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:48.006
I took it out! She's OK!

01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:50.970
You need to come down here, OK?

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:55.603
Yeah, yeah. I'm coming down.
I'm taking you out of there, OK?

01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:58.531
Please don't go, I need you!

01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:01.451
I need you too!

01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:02.971
I'm coming down.

01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:12.610
Lay down, lay down. Lay down.

01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:14.728
Wait, wait, wait...

01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:26.485
Lay down here.
Take it. Take it.

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:48.603
I won't say anything, I promise.

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:53.368
Please... I won't say anything,
I really won't...

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:52.681
Kylie!

01:16:58.480 --> 01:16:59.766
Kylie!

01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:21.371
Kylie!

01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:50.170
I promise she didn't suffer.
