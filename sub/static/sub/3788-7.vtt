01:09.193 --> 01:11.559
- So, how many times you call her?
- Once.

01:11.896 --> 01:14.364
And she didn't call you back? Bitch.

01:14.465 --> 01:15.693
Emily's not a bitch.

01:15.800 --> 01:18.769
I was calling you a bitch,
for thinking about calling her again.

01:18.869 --> 01:20.234
That is very bitch-like.

01:20.337 --> 01:23.474
You call a girl once, she don't call you back,
the relationship's over.

01:23.707 --> 01:25.868
I was drunk.
I don't even remember what I said.

01:25.976 --> 01:27.443
Maybe she never got the message.

01:27.545 --> 01:29.979
- You drunk-dialed her?
- Still, no excuse.

01:30.080 --> 01:32.139
- No more tequila for this guy.
- You're cut off.

01:32.249 --> 01:35.480
- What is she so mad about, anyway?
- It's not that she's mad.

01:35.586 --> 01:39.488
She feels like I'm putting her in
an uncomfortable situation with me and Ari.

01:39.590 --> 01:41.649
You should've bluffed her, spun it around.

01:41.759 --> 01:44.421
Let her think you're uncomfortable
with the situation.

01:44.528 --> 01:48.521
First Kristen, then Emily.
Why do you let these girls get in your head?

01:48.632 --> 01:52.432
The guys have a point.
You're getting a little soft in your old age.

01:52.536 --> 01:55.096
It's Ari, finally. Ari, where are you?

01:55.239 --> 01:57.707
<i>Right where I'm supposed to be.</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:57.975 --> 02:00.375
We're at Coffee Bean, like we said.

02:00.744 --> 02:02.644
<i>No, we said Starbucks, Eric.</i>

02:02.746 --> 02:05.715
<i>I distinctly remember,</i>
<i>because I fucked a counter girl here.</i>

02:05.816 --> 02:09.013
Be careful crossing the street.
He's at Starbucks.

02:14.758 --> 02:16.726
What, did you rob a bank?

02:16.827 --> 02:20.695
I earned it. <i>Pacific Blue</i> residuals, baby.
We sold Malaysia.

02:21.098 --> 02:24.397
- How much you got there, bro?
- Don't you worry about it.

02:24.668 --> 02:26.295
So, what's with the face to face?

02:26.403 --> 02:28.997
I just want you guys to know
that all of my attention...

02:29.106 --> 02:31.574
is now focused on <i>Queens Boulevard.</i>

02:31.876 --> 02:33.275
That's nice.

02:33.911 --> 02:36.709
- Isn't that nice?
- Yeah. So, we have a deal or what?

02:36.814 --> 02:39.146
- We got a deal pending.
- Pending what?

02:39.250 --> 02:41.650
Pending a meeting with the director.

02:42.019 --> 02:43.953
We gotta get approved by the director now?

02:44.054 --> 02:47.717
No, we don't. It's like a meet and greet.
A blind date. Fifteen minutes.

02:47.825 --> 02:50.453
You have a drink, you like each other,
you make a movie.

02:50.561 --> 02:52.586
- Blind dates are my forte.
- There you go.

02:52.696 --> 02:57.497
I'm heading up the coast with the missus.
Call me, tell me if you guys like each other.

02:57.735 --> 02:59.430
- You did good, Ari.
- Thank you.

02:59.537 --> 03:01.596
- Tell him, E.
- You did good, Ari.

03:01.705 --> 03:04.003
We just had a moment. Did you feel that?

03:04.108 --> 03:07.134
I think I'm gonna leave Mrs. Ari
and take you for the weekend.

03:07.244 --> 03:08.438
Don't do that.

03:08.879 --> 03:11.177
- So, who's the guy?
- Billy Walsh.

03:11.282 --> 03:12.840
- Yeah?
- You heard of him?

03:12.950 --> 03:16.283
Yeah, the guy won Sundance.
Film called <i>Daze.</i>

03:16.554 --> 03:18.385
I read the guy financed his movie...

03:18.489 --> 03:20.354
- by donating blood.
- How was it?

03:20.457 --> 03:22.823
I didn't see that shit.
You know I don't like indies.

03:22.927 --> 03:25.828
- I'm into the studio system.
- Ari says this guy's hot.

03:25.930 --> 03:28.398
Everybody in town wants to work with him.
We got him.

03:28.499 --> 03:29.864
He wants to work with Vince.

03:29.967 --> 03:32.902
- You'll ask him about a part for me, right?
- And nothing else.

03:33.003 --> 03:35.062
- Where's the meeting?
- Chateau.

03:35.539 --> 03:38.235
- Arnold, come on, boy.
- You guys want to roll with?

03:38.342 --> 03:40.105
The fuck else we got to do, player?

03:55.826 --> 03:58.317
You guys hang here.
We'll be back in a little while.

03:58.429 --> 04:01.125
Don't talk to us like we're adopted, bro.

04:13.777 --> 04:16.245
Just leave it outside the door, asshole!

04:16.346 --> 04:18.076
It's Vincent Chase.

04:20.817 --> 04:22.342
- You Billy?
- No.

04:27.891 --> 04:30.325
You guys see Billy around anywhere?

04:33.030 --> 04:35.294
- You know Billy?
- Yeah, whatever.

04:35.432 --> 04:36.592
All right.

04:39.203 --> 04:40.534
Sorry, pal.

04:43.273 --> 04:46.765
- You sure you're not Billy?
- Do I look like fucking Billy?

04:54.785 --> 04:56.810
I don't think that's Billy.

05:05.629 --> 05:07.893
My man, Vincent Chase.

05:11.902 --> 05:14.598
Wick was right.
You're very fuckable in person.

05:15.539 --> 05:18.838
You fucking laughing?
This guy's the best actor of his generation.

05:18.976 --> 05:21.501
No bullshit.
He'll blow all your asses off the screen.

05:21.612 --> 05:24.080
- Thank you.
- You guys are early.

05:24.181 --> 05:26.342
Actually, no. We're right on time.

05:26.450 --> 05:29.078
That might mean something to me
if I knew who you were.

05:29.186 --> 05:32.053
- This is my buddy, Eric.
- You can call me E.

05:33.424 --> 05:36.757
Is that your thing, being on time?
I won Sundance at 24.

05:36.860 --> 05:39.556
What do you gotta say
about that kind of arrival?

05:39.663 --> 05:41.426
- Congratulations.
- Cool.

05:41.598 --> 05:45.432
I'm gonna get dressed.
You guys grab a cocktail or something.

05:47.171 --> 05:48.763
I'll be right out.

05:50.007 --> 05:51.474
He's a nice guy.

05:52.142 --> 05:55.634
We're not here to make friends.
We're here to make a movie.

05:55.746 --> 05:58.874
You know Howard Hughes
used to stay in this room back in the day.

05:58.982 --> 06:01.075
Now Scorsese's doing the movie.

06:01.185 --> 06:04.382
They offered it to Billy first,
but he turned it down.

06:04.488 --> 06:06.581
He ain't gonna soft-soap nobody.

06:06.990 --> 06:09.982
Billy's a genius, brother.
You're lucky to be working with him.

06:10.360 --> 06:12.828
- You're an asshole!
- Shut up!

06:14.498 --> 06:17.433
- Come on, let's get some coffee.
- Bye, baby.

06:21.972 --> 06:23.599
Come on. I'm buying.

06:33.250 --> 06:36.014
You ever jerk off
with a belt around your neck?

06:36.253 --> 06:38.380
No. Should I?

06:40.357 --> 06:42.018
Sounds interesting.

06:42.493 --> 06:46.361
All right, forget that shit.
Check this out. Scandinavian twins.

06:46.463 --> 06:49.398
For $1,500, they'll come over
and fuck us like we're Vince.

06:49.500 --> 06:51.161
I don't pay for pussy.

06:51.268 --> 06:54.135
Since when?
It's like 50 rub and tugs with you.

06:54.238 --> 06:57.002
Since I like walking around
with money in my pocket.

06:57.107 --> 07:00.270
Come on, Drama,
you got that fat residual check.

07:00.644 --> 07:02.271
They're just your type.

07:03.147 --> 07:04.705
No means no.

07:05.783 --> 07:09.241
Let me talk to him.
You're like a fucking bull in a china shop.

07:09.353 --> 07:10.650
Thank you.

07:11.288 --> 07:12.812
All right, one.

07:14.191 --> 07:15.419
My agent.

07:15.726 --> 07:17.990
Fucking prick wants me to do
a studio movie.

07:18.095 --> 07:19.255
Yeah, mine, too.

07:19.363 --> 07:22.764
I told him to go fuck himself.
I'm not in this for the money, Vince.

07:22.866 --> 07:25.460
<i>Queens Boulevard</i>
is gonna be my <i>Mean Streets.</i>

07:26.069 --> 07:29.596
- Kind of an ode to the way we grew up.
- You grew up in Queens?

07:29.706 --> 07:32.732
Scarsdale, but my dad owned a Key Food
in Kew Gardens.

07:33.811 --> 07:37.247
I bet you'd like to see Vince
do a big studio movie, E?

07:37.347 --> 07:40.680
- Actually, no.
- He just wants me to do a good film.

07:40.884 --> 07:45.821
Come on. There is no glory
in making a $5 million indie, E.

07:46.256 --> 07:48.053
There is if it's a good one.

07:48.358 --> 07:52.226
Ari said you had thoughts on the script,
things you might want to change.

07:52.329 --> 07:54.194
- It's done.
- What did you do?

07:55.132 --> 07:57.430
I made Vincent's character a man.

07:57.568 --> 08:01.004
See, he was a pussy.
That sensitive shit was putting me to sleep.

08:01.104 --> 08:03.095
The stuff with the girlfriend
was pretty good.

08:03.207 --> 08:04.606
No, it wasn't.

08:05.709 --> 08:08.405
Vince, I want to shoot you long-lensed.

08:08.512 --> 08:10.878
Give you size in the frame, power.

08:11.014 --> 08:14.643
Like Redford in <i>Three Days of the Condor.</i>
McQueen in <i>Bullitt.</i>

08:14.985 --> 08:17.385
You like <i>The Pope of Greenwich Village?</i>

08:17.487 --> 08:19.148
It's one of my favorite films.

08:19.323 --> 08:20.950
You should do a remake of that, Vince.

08:21.058 --> 08:24.255
No. No one should ever remake that movie.
It was perfect.

08:24.361 --> 08:27.023
You'd let them redo the <i>Mona Lisa,</i> E?

08:27.998 --> 08:29.226
Anyway...

08:30.467 --> 08:32.697
read it. Tell me what you think.

08:33.102 --> 08:36.129
- All right.
- Call my cell. I'll be waiting.

08:36.440 --> 08:39.500
- Great.
- Don't let the suit influence you.

08:39.643 --> 08:41.577
Hey, man, I'm not a suit.

08:42.111 --> 08:44.945
Yeah, man, you are.
You just don't know it yet.

08:45.616 --> 08:48.210
- Toodle-loo.
- See you later.

08:49.987 --> 08:51.955
I'm Johnny, Vince's brother.

08:52.122 --> 08:55.285
I really digged your movie, man.

08:55.392 --> 08:57.326
- It was great.
<i>- Gracie.</i>

09:00.197 --> 09:01.528
Unbelievable.

09:01.865 --> 09:04.060
- You must've found a glitch.
- So what?

09:04.167 --> 09:05.896
So you're a little glitch bitch.

09:06.003 --> 09:08.369
Blame the game makers.
Don't blame the player, hater.

09:08.472 --> 09:09.461
Give me that control.

09:09.573 --> 09:11.131
- Get off! Why are...
- This one sucks.

09:11.241 --> 09:12.902
Who dates Scarlett Johansson?

09:13.377 --> 09:16.369
Ryan Gosling? Actually, I don't know.

09:16.780 --> 09:18.111
I love her.

09:18.749 --> 09:20.910
Vince, we got a big problem here.

09:21.018 --> 09:23.748
E., we have no problems. Life is good.

09:24.021 --> 09:25.750
Do you know who dates
Scarlett Johansson?

09:25.856 --> 09:27.687
- No.
- I think I'm in love with her.

09:27.791 --> 09:28.758
Did you read this?

09:28.859 --> 09:30.850
You know I like to get
your impressions first.

09:30.961 --> 09:33.691
It's a disaster.
This guy Walsh is out of his fucking mind.

09:33.797 --> 09:34.765
Don't get so emotional just 'cause
you got a personal problem with him.

09:34.765 --> 09:37.256
Don't get so emotional just 'cause
you got a personal problem with him.

09:37.367 --> 09:38.459
What?

09:39.603 --> 09:41.468
He wasn't so nice to E.

09:42.973 --> 09:45.737
- That's not it.
- This guy gets more opinionated every day.

09:45.842 --> 09:48.140
Don't fuck this up, E.
I really want to do this.

09:48.245 --> 09:50.338
The guy said the suit would be judgmental.

09:50.447 --> 09:53.382
He's got a guy blowing you on Page 26!

09:54.084 --> 09:55.312
Come on.

09:55.919 --> 09:57.147
Seriously?

09:58.088 --> 09:59.248
I better read it.

09:59.356 --> 10:02.325
- I better read that shit, too.
- Who's blowing him?

10:02.826 --> 10:06.387
I hope it's not the part of the bookie,
'cause I'm playing that.

10:06.563 --> 10:08.531
That would be really awkward.

10:09.499 --> 10:12.468
Look, Vince,
there's no shame in playing gay.

10:12.569 --> 10:15.834
Look at Tom Hanks, <i>Philadelphia.</i>
The guy won an Oscar.

10:16.807 --> 10:19.071
I'd take it in the ass on camera for an Oscar.

10:19.176 --> 10:22.839
You'd take it in the ass
for a guest spot on <i>The Hughleys.</i>

10:22.946 --> 10:24.436
That's not even on the air anymore.

10:24.548 --> 10:27.142
I don't know about you,
but I don't want to see Vince...

10:27.250 --> 10:30.447
running around Queens
with a silk shirt knotted at the bellybutton.

10:30.554 --> 10:33.148
- You're really homophobic.
- No, I'm not.

10:33.290 --> 10:36.088
If you were gay, okay, I'd accept that.
But you're not.

10:36.193 --> 10:38.127
So why are you gonna pretend you are?

10:38.228 --> 10:41.561
'Cause the guy's an actor, you fucking idiot.
That's what he does.

10:41.665 --> 10:44.395
No, that's what you do,
you ass-fucked loser.

10:44.868 --> 10:46.563
Keep it up, Turtle.

10:46.670 --> 10:48.763
It's not about an Oscar
or the neighborhood.

10:48.872 --> 10:50.601
If it's good, I'll do it.

10:50.707 --> 10:53.107
I'm just not sure I understand
why it's in there.

10:53.210 --> 10:56.805
It's in there 'cause Walsh is psychotic.
He's got to change the script back.

10:56.913 --> 10:59.211
- So call him, E.
- I'm calling him.

11:02.786 --> 11:04.253
Billy, it's E.

11:05.422 --> 11:06.980
Yeah, Vince's guy.

11:08.091 --> 11:10.821
Listen, we want to talk to you
about the script.

11:12.596 --> 11:14.154
Hold on a second.

11:14.531 --> 11:17.364
He's at Crazy Girls.
He wants us to come over right now.

11:17.467 --> 11:19.833
- Sweet.
- Crazy Girls at noon?

11:19.936 --> 11:21.733
Cancel that order, honey.

11:21.838 --> 11:23.999
Crazy Girls has got a great buffet.

11:44.327 --> 11:46.158
Why aren't you eating?

11:46.296 --> 11:48.321
They got downgraded to a "B."

11:48.432 --> 11:51.492
If these warm plates aren't heated up
to the right temperature...

11:51.601 --> 11:53.660
they become hotbeds of bacteria.

11:56.039 --> 11:58.769
Isn't that that girl from Cheetahs in Vegas?

11:58.875 --> 12:01.400
Yeah, the one you cock blocked me for.

12:01.711 --> 12:03.611
Please, she was so into me.

12:11.054 --> 12:12.578
Don't cock block.

12:12.956 --> 12:16.448
- I know you guys. How you been?
- I'm good.

12:16.560 --> 12:19.723
This perv likes to beat off
with a belt around his neck.

12:19.830 --> 12:21.764
This guy pays for pussy.

12:22.532 --> 12:24.625
I see you guys haven't changed.

12:25.735 --> 12:27.703
So, who wants a lap dance?

12:27.804 --> 12:30.170
Sorry, baby. The money stays here.

12:41.251 --> 12:44.220
What's the problem, E? You want a blonde?

12:44.321 --> 12:46.312
I just wanted to talk about the script.

12:46.423 --> 12:49.290
So talk about it.
You thought it was genius, right?

12:49.392 --> 12:50.916
Not really, no.

12:51.094 --> 12:53.392
No? What the fuck do you know?

12:53.763 --> 12:56.857
Vince, I thought I told you
not to let the suit influence you.

12:56.967 --> 12:58.798
Stop calling me a suit, all right?

12:58.902 --> 13:01.666
I just liked the script better
the way it was, that's all.

13:01.771 --> 13:03.170
What did you think, Vince?

13:03.273 --> 13:06.606
I thought it was interesting.
I just didn't totally get it.

13:06.710 --> 13:09.474
That's cool.
I was trying to be abstract, like Kurosawa.

13:09.579 --> 13:13.276
- You ever seen a Kurosawa film?
- Yeah, I saw <i>Seven Samurai.</i>

13:13.383 --> 13:16.113
I seen them all, Vince.
I'll send you a couple.

13:16.219 --> 13:17.186
Cool.

13:17.287 --> 13:20.222
You think the scene
where you're getting a blowjob from a guy...

13:20.323 --> 13:22.154
makes you look like a fag, right?

13:23.460 --> 13:27.362
You ever see <i>Midnight Cowboy?</i>
Does Voight look like a fag in that?

13:27.464 --> 13:29.625
In that hat and those boots, he does.

13:31.101 --> 13:33.501
My point is, I wanna make you look manly.

13:34.137 --> 13:36.264
- Okay.
- But you gotta trust me.

13:40.410 --> 13:41.377
Kristen.

13:42.412 --> 13:43.606
Really?

13:44.181 --> 13:46.342
Excuse me for a second. Sorry.

13:46.816 --> 13:48.215
Ex-Mrs. Suit?

13:49.753 --> 13:51.220
You could say that.

13:51.588 --> 13:53.522
- Hello?
- So who's Emily?

13:54.124 --> 13:56.524
What are you talking about?
How do you know Emily?

13:56.626 --> 14:00.892
I got home and checked my messages
and heard you calling Emily.

14:00.997 --> 14:02.624
<i>Can you turn the music down?</i>

14:02.732 --> 14:06.395
I was drunk last night.
I must've dialed your number by accident.

14:06.503 --> 14:10.064
You sure it wasn't your subconscious way
of trying to reach out to me?

14:10.440 --> 14:12.237
You analyzing me right now?

14:12.842 --> 14:16.243
I got the message and I tried not to call,
but I miss you.

14:16.880 --> 14:18.006
Seriously?

14:18.481 --> 14:21.473
Can we go out to dinner sometime this week
and talk about it?

14:21.585 --> 14:22.609
<i>Yeah, definitely.</i>

14:22.719 --> 14:25.552
I need $100.
This girl's gonna jerk me in the back.

14:25.655 --> 14:26.622
No.

14:26.723 --> 14:29.214
Drama won't lend me money
if it's for sexual acts.

14:29.326 --> 14:31.055
Not now, Turtle. I'm on the phone.

14:31.161 --> 14:33.425
You got glitter all over your face.

14:35.765 --> 14:38.131
- Can I call you tonight?
<i>- All right.</i>

14:38.235 --> 14:39.259
Bye.

14:45.508 --> 14:47.305
What do you mean,
you committed to the guy?

14:47.410 --> 14:49.810
I dig his vibe.
You don't have to get mad at me.

14:49.913 --> 14:52.177
He is pretty cool.
He was throwing strippers $20s.

14:52.282 --> 14:55.410
He's a pretentious prick.
You don't wanna make this movie with him.

14:55.518 --> 14:58.009
You don't know artists.
You haven't hung out with many.

14:58.121 --> 15:00.988
- Yeah, we're very sensitive.
- I know people, all right?

15:01.091 --> 15:03.082
This guy is an egomaniac
and he's an asshole.

15:03.193 --> 15:05.525
Vince, I'll respect
whatever decision you make...

15:05.629 --> 15:08.120
but I'm still going for
that part of the bookie.

15:08.231 --> 15:10.529
I thought I was making the decisions
around here.

15:10.634 --> 15:12.898
Not ultimately. Enough of this.

15:13.436 --> 15:17.236
Why don't you tell these guys
how you drunk-dialed Kristen, not Emily?

15:17.340 --> 15:19.103
- You called Kristen?
- You idiot.

15:19.209 --> 15:21.905
What's wrong with you?
Don't ever drunk-dial.

15:22.012 --> 15:25.243
E., marry this girl or kill her.
We can't take this anymore.

15:28.385 --> 15:31.548
- So, did you call the babysitter?
- I thought you did.

15:31.788 --> 15:36.020
No, you were supposed to.
You're the one who likes to talk to her.

15:36.126 --> 15:39.152
You think I have a thing for Olga?
This weekend is all us.

15:39.262 --> 15:41.059
I'm good to go, baby.

15:42.065 --> 15:44.863
Don't even think about answering that.

15:48.138 --> 15:49.935
- Don't even...
- Just quick.

15:50.206 --> 15:52.265
- Hello?
- We got a big problem.

15:52.409 --> 15:53.933
Hold on a second.

15:54.778 --> 15:55.904
Vince has got a problem.

15:56.012 --> 16:00.346
Baby, I took it an hour ago, okay?
I got 10 more minutes before it kicks in.

16:00.483 --> 16:02.610
Just give me a second, honey. Baby.

16:05.021 --> 16:06.147
Vince hated Walsh?

16:06.256 --> 16:08.884
No, I hated him.
Vince doesn't know I'm doing this.

16:09.826 --> 16:12.659
Behind the back. Slick, I'm aroused.
Go, baby, go.

16:12.796 --> 16:15.560
- Have you met this guy?
<i>- Yeah, he's a pompous dickhead.</i>

16:15.665 --> 16:16.996
Why didn't you say something?

16:17.100 --> 16:19.933
You wanted me to deliver the movie.
That's what I did.

16:20.236 --> 16:21.897
You got to get Walsh off.

16:22.439 --> 16:25.966
So now you need my help?
So now you come to the master.

16:26.076 --> 16:28.567
No, Vince needs you.
This guy's gonna ruin the film.

16:28.678 --> 16:31.476
This meeting was not set up
so that Walsh could approve Vince.

16:31.581 --> 16:34.243
<i>It was set up so Vince could approve Walsh,</i>
<i>all right?</i>

16:34.351 --> 16:36.478
He picks up the phone, the guy's done.

16:36.586 --> 16:39.384
He won't do it, he likes him.
He digs his vibe.

16:39.589 --> 16:41.648
<i>- Yeah? Has he seen his movie?</i>
- No.

16:41.758 --> 16:43.885
<i>- Have you seen his movie?</i>
- No.

16:44.127 --> 16:47.119
Do your fucking homework.
You've got a screening room. Use it.

16:47.230 --> 16:48.959
<i>- Come on.</i>
- What, have you seen it?

16:49.065 --> 16:53.525
No, I haven't. You think I'll stand in line
in the snow in Utah wearing a beanie?

16:53.703 --> 16:55.728
<i>Maybe Vince will hate the movie, though.</i>

16:58.475 --> 16:59.635
I gotta go.

17:02.645 --> 17:04.943
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to the pool.

17:05.048 --> 17:08.506
- Come on.
- You said no business calls. We had a deal.

17:08.917 --> 17:10.943
I'm ready to go here, all right?

17:11.054 --> 17:12.487
It's like R. Kelly at recess.

17:12.589 --> 17:15.786
Honey, what are you doing?
Are you kidding me? Baby!

17:18.928 --> 17:19.895
Hello?

17:19.996 --> 17:23.396
<i>The Advocate</i> just called to confirm a rumor
that in Vince's next movie...

17:23.500 --> 17:25.627
he's gonna be jerking off some guy
in the subway.

17:25.734 --> 17:29.262
No, Shauna, the guy is touching him.
And don't worry, he's not doing it.

17:29.372 --> 17:32.705
Vince is on his way to becoming
a major sex symbol. Don't fuck this up.

17:32.809 --> 17:35.471
<i>- Get him on screen with someone with tits.</i>
- Man!

17:37.614 --> 17:40.742
When I was on <i>Kimmel,</i>
we said the name of the place...

17:40.850 --> 17:43.182
the guy gave us the whole system
for nothing.

17:43.286 --> 17:46.153
What do you mean, you were on <i>Kimmel?</i>
Is that "X"?

17:47.457 --> 17:50.221
- No, it's a TV show.
- Do you have any "X"?

17:50.927 --> 17:54.522
No, I don't have any "X."
Why don't you girls have a seat?

17:56.199 --> 17:58.429
Even if this movie
is better than <i>The Godfather...</i>

17:58.535 --> 18:01.561
you guys both tell Vince you hated it.
What is this?

18:02.238 --> 18:04.706
That's Sierra and this is Portia.

18:05.975 --> 18:09.411
We pulled them out of Crazy Girls, bro.
For free. How sweet is that?

18:09.512 --> 18:10.740
Sweet.

18:13.016 --> 18:14.347
Full house.

18:16.619 --> 18:19.179
- Nice.
- I bet this movie's gonna kick ass.

18:21.624 --> 18:24.525
- Positivity.
- All right, Turtle, fire it up.

19:12.175 --> 19:14.040
Holy shit, that sucked!

19:14.577 --> 19:17.910
- Fuck black and white.
- Reminds me of Godard.

19:19.616 --> 19:21.311
So, what did you think?

19:22.218 --> 19:23.310
What'd you think?

19:23.419 --> 19:27.446
I knew you were gonna hate it.
You came into this with no other possibility.

19:28.024 --> 19:29.548
I didn't hate it.

19:29.926 --> 19:31.359
You didn't hate it?

19:31.961 --> 19:35.124
You know, truthfully,
I think this guy's a complete jerk-off.

19:35.231 --> 19:37.324
- It was amazing, right?
- He's a fucking genius.

19:37.467 --> 19:40.766
Vince, you do this movie,
they're gonna burn down Queens Boulevard.

19:40.870 --> 19:44.237
Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.
Johnny, run down the list again.

19:44.774 --> 19:48.676
Will Smith, <i>Six Degrees of Separation.</i>
Robin Williams, <i>Birdcage.</i>

19:49.412 --> 19:54.076
Lucky Leo's gone gay two times:
<i>Basketball Diaries</i> and <i>Eclipse.</i>

19:54.517 --> 19:58.078
So has Pacino in <i>Cruising</i>
and <i>Dog Day Afternoon.</i>

19:58.655 --> 20:01.522
- Dustin Hoffman, <i>Rain Man.</i>
<i>- Rain Man</i> was gay?

20:01.724 --> 20:03.385
He wasn't gay, just retarded.

20:03.493 --> 20:07.190
Either way, you play gay or retarded,
you win an Oscar.

20:07.363 --> 20:10.298
Guys, give me a second.
I need some time to think.

20:10.400 --> 20:13.927
What do you girls say
we take this party up to the hot tub?

20:14.304 --> 20:16.795
I'm really not in the mood for that tonight.

20:17.240 --> 20:21.108
- What's the matter? You don't feel good?
- I'm a little depressed.

20:22.278 --> 20:25.145
I'm getting evicted.
I'm late on my rent again.

20:25.682 --> 20:28.549
- How much is rent?
- $1,200.

20:31.588 --> 20:34.819
I got your rent money right here.
Let's go swimming.

20:39.395 --> 20:41.090
I thought you don't pay for sex.

20:41.197 --> 20:43.688
I'm not paying for sex.
I'm paying her rent, jerk-off.

20:43.800 --> 20:45.097
Yeah, right.

20:46.369 --> 20:47.358
So?

20:47.470 --> 20:49.904
I feel like he's gonna make a great movie.

20:50.006 --> 20:52.474
So the only problem you have
is that one scene?

20:52.575 --> 20:54.236
Yeah, one fucking scene.

20:58.014 --> 21:01.643
- I can't believe I fell off the wagon.
- Come on, no regrets.

21:02.018 --> 21:06.455
- Was she any good, at least?
- She was great. She's coming back tonight.

21:07.156 --> 21:10.284
I'm gonna have to borrow some money
from Vince.

21:10.760 --> 21:13.024
We're willing to respect
your vision of the movie.

21:13.129 --> 21:16.587
But we want final cut on the scene.
It makes no sense to either of us.

21:16.699 --> 21:19.532
But you shoot it,
and maybe you'll change our mind.

21:20.837 --> 21:22.702
No. Sorry, no deal.

21:22.805 --> 21:26.400
- Then Vince isn't doing it.
- Vincent, I make movies a certain way.

21:26.509 --> 21:27.908
You made one movie.

21:28.978 --> 21:31.310
Look, Vince, you're the star.

21:32.348 --> 21:36.079
Wick will throw me off before he loses you,
so be it.

21:36.753 --> 21:39.620
You're willing to throw
this whole movie away over one point?

21:39.722 --> 21:41.155
Yes, suit.

21:41.624 --> 21:44.286
That's how much I care about my vision.

21:45.428 --> 21:48.022
Good luck with it, Vincent. Seriously.

21:52.635 --> 21:54.500
All right, fuck it. I'll do it.

21:54.604 --> 21:56.538
- You'll do it?
- I'll do it.

22:01.110 --> 22:03.670
All right, do it. Don't fuck this up.

22:06.082 --> 22:07.879
The guy blowing you...

22:07.984 --> 22:11.112
I'm gonna play that part.
That way, you're in really good hands.

22:11.220 --> 22:14.519
Don't worry,
I've got a pretty solid acting background.

22:19.662 --> 22:23.860
- You're fucking with me, aren't you?
- I fucking had you, motherfucker!

22:23.966 --> 22:25.297
Fucker!

22:25.401 --> 22:28.859
- I don't get it.
- It was a joke. He was joking the whole time.

22:28.971 --> 22:32.031
- What, the scene's not in the movie?
- No, it's not in the movie.

22:32.141 --> 22:35.668
- It made no sense in the movie.
- I knew it, God damn it.

22:35.778 --> 22:38.542
Good fucking scene, though.
I'm gonna use it somewhere else.

22:38.648 --> 22:41.173
And it wasn't a joke, Vincent. It was a test.

22:41.284 --> 22:43.309
I needed to make sure that you trusted me.

22:43.419 --> 22:47.014
The only way this movie's gonna work
is if we trust each other.

22:47.123 --> 22:48.613
Yeah, I agree.

22:49.692 --> 22:51.284
But you know what?

22:52.028 --> 22:54.189
Now there's a bigger problem.

22:54.697 --> 22:56.858
- What's that?
- I can't trust you.

22:57.266 --> 22:58.324
Come on.

22:58.434 --> 23:01.062
No, you can give E. A hard time.
That's cool.

23:01.170 --> 23:05.197
You think you're gonna fuck with me,
and I'm gonna sit back and do nothing?

23:05.308 --> 23:09.176
You know what? Fuck you, motherfucker.
You're fired.

23:14.250 --> 23:16.878
- I'm a good actor, aren't I?
- Fucking...

23:17.587 --> 23:19.452
You fucking...

23:19.922 --> 23:22.288
I'm so confused right now. What are you...

23:22.391 --> 23:25.554
- A toast. I'll toast to that.
- Yo, Johnny, Turtle.

23:25.661 --> 23:26.855
We're making a movie.

23:26.963 --> 23:29.261
No, Vince. I'm putting my foot down.

23:29.365 --> 23:31.196
Don't worry, the scene's gone.

23:31.300 --> 23:33.598
- Yeah?
- He's been fucking with us.

23:33.836 --> 23:35.064
Cheers, baby!

23:35.171 --> 23:37.662
To Vince not getting a blowjob
from some dude.

23:37.774 --> 23:39.139
Thank God.

23:41.811 --> 23:46.544
- Billy, I gotta tell you, loved your movie.
- Yeah, you told me that already, man.

23:46.783 --> 23:50.844
- Yeah, but this time I actually saw it.
- Did you actually love it?

23:51.220 --> 23:54.519
Look, man, I just want to play the part
of the bookie.

23:54.624 --> 23:56.922
I know I could do a really good job.

23:57.693 --> 24:01.129
A lying, conniving, two-faced prick.
You're perfect for it.

24:01.230 --> 24:03.027
- Thanks.
- All right!

24:03.132 --> 24:04.827
There it is!

24:06.335 --> 24:09.793
Stand clear of the closing doors.
Next stop, <i>Queens Boulevard.</i>

24:09.906 --> 24:11.134
Cheers!
