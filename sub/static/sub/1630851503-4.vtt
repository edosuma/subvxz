To Dan and Louise!

18:18.030 --> 18:21.301
May they last longer
than Ben and Darlene!

18:21.334 --> 18:24.737
I thought that was so funny
when Becky did that!

18:24.771 --> 18:26.439
Yeah, show's over,
Shecky.

18:28.175 --> 18:30.843
I just want to
say something.

18:30.877 --> 18:33.913
I want to thank all of you for
making my life so wonderful.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.649
And thank you, Louise...

18:36.683 --> 18:38.818
for finding a way
to top that.

18:38.851 --> 18:41.288
Aww.
That was beautiful, Dan.

18:41.321 --> 18:42.622
Now show us your boobs!

18:42.655 --> 18:43.690
[ Laughter ]

18:43.723 --> 18:44.724
Later!

18:45.958 --> 18:48.361
And to my hubby!

18:48.395 --> 18:51.664
Oh, man, I never thought
I would say that.

18:51.698 --> 18:54.000
But now I don't think
I'll ever stop.

18:54.033 --> 18:55.001
Ooh.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.607
Thanks for being there
for me today.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.109
I have to come up with
some better coping skills,

19:03.142 --> 19:04.844
for both our sakes.

19:04.877 --> 19:07.447
You got this.
Aww.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.283
You know I have my nephew's
christening next week.

19:10.317 --> 19:12.719
It'll be kind of a letdown
without all the fornicating

19:12.752 --> 19:15.688
and destruction of
a Conner get-together.

19:15.722 --> 19:17.089
It's what we do.

19:19.392 --> 19:22.362
Since the reception's off,
when everyone leaves,

19:22.395 --> 19:24.631
can Ben stay and do
foreign-movie night?

19:24.664 --> 19:26.566
We're gonna watch "Master of
the Flying Guillotine,"

19:26.599 --> 19:28.335
put it on mute,
and do our own dialogue

19:28.368 --> 19:30.036
so it becomes
a rom-com.

19:30.069 --> 19:31.371
They lose their heads
in love.

19:32.872 --> 19:34.674
You know, Mark, we might just
have to put a pin

19:34.707 --> 19:36.743
in foreign-movie night
for a while.

19:36.776 --> 19:38.745
That is so unfair.

19:38.778 --> 19:41.147
How about you guys figure out
how to be around each other

19:41.180 --> 19:43.216
so you don't screw up stuff
in my life?

19:43.250 --> 19:45.918
I still like Ben, and depending
on what you decide,

19:45.952 --> 19:47.854
I'll tell you how
I feel about you.

19:50.423 --> 19:52.058
I'm just gonna grab
a beer.

19:56.296 --> 19:58.097
Mark wants you to stay
for movie night.

19:59.432 --> 20:00.767
How do you feel about that?

20:00.800 --> 20:03.002
[ Laughs ] I hate it.

20:03.035 --> 20:06.038
Really hard to be in the same
room with you right now.

20:06.072 --> 20:08.441
But I shouldn't let that
affect your relationship

20:08.475 --> 20:10.042
with Mark.

20:10.076 --> 20:12.178
I hope you'll understand if
I choose to go out in a tornado

20:12.211 --> 20:14.046
rather than sticking around
while you're here.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.717
Well, you're a good mom.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.386
Hmm.

20:19.419 --> 20:21.621
Must have killed you to say
something nice about me.

20:21.654 --> 20:24.591
Burned my throat like
a ghost pepper, but I'll heal.

20:24.624 --> 20:27.394
Mm, be careful out there,
will ya?

20:27.427 --> 20:29.195
You might want to put
some rocks in your pockets,

20:29.228 --> 20:32.465
or the wind'll carry you off
like a plastic bag.

20:33.800 --> 20:36.035
Thanks for caring.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.971
It's hard to stop --
even if you want to.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.575
Jackie:
Ben, look at my boobs!

20:42.609 --> 20:43.610
Ben: Oh, God!

20:47.980 --> 20:48.481
* I was dancin'...

20:49.449 --> 20:51.150
I will always
remember you

20:51.183 --> 20:53.119
just as you look
right now.

20:54.687 --> 20:56.255
Are you going off to war?

20:56.289 --> 20:58.124
No.

20:58.157 --> 21:01.428
I mean, you'll never
get older in my eyes.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.796
You're always gonna look
just like this.

21:05.131 --> 21:07.099
[ Smooches ]
I love you, Mr. Conner.

21:07.133 --> 21:09.101
I love you, Mrs. Conner.

21:12.004 --> 21:13.806
* My friend stole...

21:13.840 --> 21:16.709
Um, eventually, they're all
gonna move out, right?

21:17.877 --> 21:20.480
Let's not spoil
the moment.

21:20.513 --> 21:23.750
* I remember the night

21:23.783 --> 21:27.554
