00:00.130 --> 00:02.270
- Previously
on "God Friended Me"...

00:02.270 --> 00:04.230
- Someone calling themselves
God on Facebook

00:04.230 --> 00:05.670
starting sending me
Friend Suggestions

00:05.670 --> 00:07.070
for people in need of help.

00:07.070 --> 00:08.170
- ♪ I'm only human ♪

00:08.170 --> 00:09.640
What the hell?

00:09.640 --> 00:11.210
- ♪ After all,
don't put the blame on ♪

00:11.210 --> 00:12.210
- I know how to find people.

00:12.210 --> 00:13.610
- What happened with Eli?

00:13.610 --> 00:14.780
- He wasn't the one.

00:16.410 --> 00:18.080
- We want you to come
to Paris with us,

00:18.080 --> 00:18.950
and we want you
to write a book about it.

00:18.950 --> 00:20.250
- Cara, what I'm trying
to say is--

00:20.250 --> 00:21.480
- Please don't say it.

00:21.480 --> 00:22.790
I won't be able
to get on that plane.

00:22.790 --> 00:24.090
- Miles Finer?

00:24.090 --> 00:25.150
Yesterday,
I got a friend request

00:25.150 --> 00:27.720
from someone calling themselves
God on Facebook

00:27.720 --> 00:29.690
and they sent me your name.

00:33.160 --> 00:35.130
- Life in the Big Apple

00:35.130 --> 00:36.270
can be hard sometimes.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.470
It's easy to feel alone,

00:37.470 --> 00:40.100
like you're out there
fending for yourself.

00:40.100 --> 00:42.670
But one man's got your back,

00:42.670 --> 00:44.710
making a difference
one person at a time

00:44.710 --> 00:46.110
with an assist

00:46.110 --> 00:48.140
from a mysterious
Facebook account.

00:48.140 --> 00:50.250
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to "The Block."

00:50.250 --> 00:53.080
The host of FreeVerse's
number one new podcast

00:53.080 --> 00:56.990
"The Millennial Prophet"
himself, Miles Finer.

00:56.990 --> 00:57.820
- What up, what up?

00:57.820 --> 00:59.160
Thank you for having me
on your show.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.760
- Here's what I wanna know.

01:00.760 --> 01:02.320
When are we getting more, huh?

01:02.320 --> 01:04.230
It's been a month
since your last podcast.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.930
When is season two
going to drop?

01:06.930 --> 01:08.730
- Very soon,
and let me tell you,

01:08.730 --> 01:10.130
things have gotten interesting.

01:10.130 --> 01:12.600
- Oh, I can't wait
to hear all about it.

01:12.600 --> 01:14.070
But before we do,

01:14.070 --> 01:14.940
tell me what's going on

01:14.940 --> 01:16.570
with the rest
of the God Account crew?

01:16.570 --> 01:17.340
- They're all doing great.

01:17.340 --> 01:18.770
As you know,

01:18.770 --> 01:21.740
my dad retired from the church
and got engaged.

01:21.740 --> 01:23.180
Wedding's in six weeks.

01:23.180 --> 01:25.050
My sister Ali
is running point on that

01:25.050 --> 01:27.050
to make sure nothing
falls through the cracks.

01:27.050 --> 01:28.920
- So?

01:28.920 --> 01:31.220
I think we can
make this work, hmm?

01:31.220 --> 01:32.890
What do you think?

01:32.890 --> 01:34.820
- Oh, hell, no, mm-mm.

01:34.820 --> 01:36.790
- You are not wearing that.

01:36.790 --> 01:38.330
- My friend Rakesh,

01:38.330 --> 01:40.630
he is the head of R&D
at IdentitySeal.

01:40.630 --> 01:41.800
He's like a new man,

01:41.800 --> 01:43.330
I've never seen him
work harder in his life.

01:43.330 --> 01:44.800
- Stop.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.200
Little bit to the right.

01:46.200 --> 01:47.370
Hair to the left.

01:47.370 --> 01:49.640
Perfect.

01:49.640 --> 01:51.210
- And my girlfriend Cara
is in Paris.

01:51.210 --> 01:53.680
She's writing a book
about Simon Hayes,

01:53.680 --> 01:55.040
Henry Chase, and Pria Amar,

01:55.040 --> 01:56.810
and they're working
on an algorithm

01:56.810 --> 01:58.650
that's going to
change the world.

01:58.650 --> 01:59.880
Now, she's there
for a few more months,

01:59.880 --> 02:00.880
but we talk all the time,

02:00.880 --> 02:02.920
and she has
never been happier.

02:02.920 --> 02:06.560
So, yeah, everyone is good.
I have no complaints.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.620
- There's only one thing
left to talk about,

02:08.620 --> 02:10.130
the mystery
that all your listeners

02:10.130 --> 02:11.630
are waiting to hear about...

02:11.630 --> 02:13.600
God's new friend.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.100
- Oh, that.

02:15.100 --> 02:17.800
Or as I like to call her,
the lady in the red jacket.

02:17.800 --> 02:22.040
Her name is Joy,
and she has an amazing story.

02:22.040 --> 02:22.940
- Mm.

02:22.940 --> 02:24.770
- But if you want
to hear more about that,

02:24.770 --> 02:26.610
you're gonna have to tune in
to the second season!

02:26.610 --> 02:28.210
Coming soon to FreeVerse.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.910
You're killin' me.
Killin' me, man!

02:32.650 --> 02:35.620
Dude, this is a total disaster.

02:35.620 --> 02:38.120
I told "The Block's"
entire audience that I have

02:38.120 --> 02:40.960
an amazing new season
planned around Joy,

02:40.960 --> 02:44.060
but the truth is,
I have no idea where she is!

02:44.060 --> 02:46.800
- Well, Miles, you keep
telling everyone at FreeVerse

02:46.800 --> 02:48.660
that season two of your podcast
is gonna be awesome.

02:48.660 --> 02:50.330
How 'bout just
tell 'em the truth

02:50.330 --> 02:51.800
about what happened with Joy.

02:51.800 --> 02:53.670
- What, that I told her
about the God Account

02:53.670 --> 02:54.900
and she took off?

02:54.900 --> 02:56.610
Not to mention,
FreeVerse wants

02:56.610 --> 02:57.870
a new episode
by the end of the week,

02:57.870 --> 02:59.680
and other than there
being no Joy,

02:59.680 --> 03:01.180
I haven't received
a new Friend Suggestion

03:01.180 --> 03:02.310
since she showed up.

03:02.310 --> 03:04.050
- Okay, yup, fair point.

03:04.050 --> 03:06.220
- Have you done everything that
you can to try to find her?

03:06.220 --> 03:08.020
- Yeah,
but it's like she's a ghost.

03:08.020 --> 03:09.620
Everything I could find
we already know

03:09.620 --> 03:10.650
from her Facebook page.

03:10.650 --> 03:12.890
she's from Chicago,
she went to law school there.

03:12.890 --> 03:14.190
She moved to New York
six months ago.

03:17.730 --> 03:19.930
I quit my job
at IdentitySeal, Rakesh.

03:19.930 --> 03:23.070
I bet everything
on my podcast's success,

03:23.070 --> 03:25.670
but if there's no God Account,
no Joy?

03:27.240 --> 03:28.270
there's no podcast.

03:28.270 --> 03:31.770
- Okay, look, um...

03:31.770 --> 03:34.980
I know how hard this is
for you...

03:34.980 --> 03:38.980
but I also know this is not
just about the podcast.

03:40.280 --> 03:42.120
You miss the God Account.

03:42.120 --> 03:44.890
- I just don't understand
what I did wrong.

03:44.890 --> 03:47.360
- You didn't do anything wrong.

03:47.360 --> 03:50.360
Matter of fact,
you did everything right.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.800
For whatever reason,
the God Account moved on.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.660
And maybe it's time
you did the same

03:55.660 --> 03:57.630
and unfriend the God Account.

03:57.630 --> 03:59.130
Yeah.

03:59.130 --> 04:00.970
Yeah, that's really easy
for you to say.

04:00.970 --> 04:02.840
- What does Cara think
about all this?

04:02.840 --> 04:05.240
- She's in Paris,
living her dream.

04:05.240 --> 04:07.140
Don't want to bother her
with this.

04:12.580 --> 04:15.250
- Hi.

04:15.250 --> 04:17.550
- Can I come in?
- Yeah, sure.

04:17.550 --> 04:20.120
- So, Cara, you know,

04:20.120 --> 04:22.360
we've been working
pretty closely together

04:22.360 --> 04:24.190
the last month
and, uh, I don't know,

04:24.190 --> 04:26.630
the last couple weeks,
you seem a little...

04:26.630 --> 04:28.300
kinda off.

04:28.300 --> 04:31.400
And I know you gave up a lot
to come here and work for me,

04:31.400 --> 04:33.700
and I just want to make sure
that you're not having,

04:33.700 --> 04:34.740
you know, second thoughts.

04:34.740 --> 04:36.270
- Thanks.

04:36.270 --> 04:37.270
And I'm not.

04:37.270 --> 04:38.440
- But?

04:38.440 --> 04:39.710
But.

04:39.710 --> 04:41.740
If I'm being honest...

04:41.740 --> 04:43.280
it feels like
something's missing.

04:43.280 --> 04:44.680
- Hmm.

04:44.680 --> 04:46.450
Miles?

04:46.450 --> 04:47.450
God Account?

04:47.450 --> 04:48.450
Both?

04:48.450 --> 04:49.250
- Yeah, I mean,

04:49.250 --> 04:50.690
I knew it would
be hard coming here,

04:50.690 --> 04:51.690
but it's not just that.

04:51.690 --> 04:54.160
- What is it?

04:54.160 --> 04:55.990
- It's kind of a long story.

04:55.990 --> 04:57.590
- Okay.

04:59.190 --> 05:01.060
- But something
you might be able

05:01.060 --> 05:02.630
to help me with, actually.

05:02.630 --> 05:04.130
- All right, then.

05:04.130 --> 05:06.200
Well, why don't we talk
about it over lunch?

05:06.200 --> 05:07.270
- All right.

05:22.450 --> 05:23.650
- Excuse me, can you help me?

05:23.650 --> 05:25.020
First time in New York,

05:25.020 --> 05:26.190
I'm not sure if I got off
at the right stop.

05:26.190 --> 05:27.720
I'm looking for Conway's Bar.

05:27.720 --> 05:29.460
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I know exactly where that is.

05:29.460 --> 05:31.290
You wanna take
the Second Avenue exit,

05:31.290 --> 05:33.730
make a left, two blocks over--
you can't miss it.

05:33.730 --> 05:35.360
- Thanks, appreciate it.

05:35.360 --> 05:37.570
- Oh, and by the way,
welcome to New York.

05:37.570 --> 05:39.170
Oh!

05:49.640 --> 05:50.980
Joy?

05:57.450 --> 05:59.390
Joy!

05:59.390 --> 06:01.320
Excuse me.

06:02.520 --> 06:04.030
Joy!

06:10.170 --> 06:12.030
Joy!

06:17.540 --> 06:19.570
Joy?

06:21.110 --> 06:22.680
Oh, I am so sorry.

06:22.680 --> 06:25.280
I-I thought
you were someone else.

06:25.280 --> 06:26.680
- Joy.

06:31.990 --> 06:33.160
- You.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.020
- Yeah.

06:34.020 --> 06:36.060
We need to talk.

06:41.730 --> 06:43.570
- Okay, well,
that was the last one.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.200
So, do we have a winner?

06:45.200 --> 06:46.200
- The hazelnut frosting

06:46.200 --> 06:48.170
on this one is divine.

06:48.170 --> 06:50.510
This gets my vote.
Arthur?

06:50.510 --> 06:52.170
- I do love hazelnut.

06:52.170 --> 06:53.680
- Yes!

06:53.680 --> 06:55.310
- Good.

06:55.310 --> 06:57.580
Now that that's settled,
we have got to get moving,

06:57.580 --> 07:00.150
'cause we're meeting
that realtor in a half an hour

07:00.150 --> 07:01.650
to see the place
on 131st Street.

07:01.650 --> 07:04.920
- You know, uh,
shoot, um...

07:04.920 --> 07:07.020
I forgot that was today.

07:07.020 --> 07:09.120
I promised Irvin Carter
that I would stop by the church

07:09.120 --> 07:10.460
to tie up some loose ends.

07:10.460 --> 07:14.260
Would you mind seeing if
we could reschedule next week?

07:14.260 --> 07:15.460
- Of course.

07:15.460 --> 07:17.500
- Oh, thank you.

07:18.670 --> 07:20.270
- Mm-hmm.
- And thank you.

07:26.940 --> 07:28.040
- Look, Miles,

07:28.040 --> 07:29.140
I can't deal with this
right now.

07:29.140 --> 07:31.980
- I'm asking
for five minutes, please.

07:31.980 --> 07:33.650
- Fine.

07:33.650 --> 07:35.280
I'll give you two.

07:35.280 --> 07:36.590
How'd you know
I'd be here, anyway?

07:36.590 --> 07:37.690
- Actually, I didn't.

07:37.690 --> 07:39.550
I think the God Account
had something to do with it.

07:39.550 --> 07:40.720
- God Account.

07:40.720 --> 07:42.390
You mean your friend
the cyberterrorist?

07:42.390 --> 07:44.190
- The God Account
is not a cyberterrorist.

07:44.190 --> 07:45.090
- Really?

07:45.090 --> 07:46.160
'Cause ever since
that day on the street,

07:46.160 --> 07:47.560
it won't leave me alone.

07:47.560 --> 07:49.300
- Wait, you've been getting
Friend Suggestions?

07:49.300 --> 07:50.670
- No, not since
it sent me your name.

07:50.670 --> 07:52.100
What I meant is,

07:52.100 --> 07:54.340
it has completely hijacked
my phone, my computer.

07:54.340 --> 07:56.000
It keeps blasting
the song "Human"

07:56.000 --> 07:57.170
in the middle of the night.

07:57.170 --> 07:59.170
- Look, I went through
the same thing.

07:59.170 --> 08:00.980
You should've come
and talked to me.

08:00.980 --> 08:03.040
- Like I told you
that day on the street,

08:03.040 --> 08:05.650
I don't want any part in this.

08:05.650 --> 08:07.220
Anyway, good talk.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.980
- I know how to make it stop.

08:13.420 --> 08:15.320
You have to help
your Friend Suggestion.

08:17.260 --> 08:20.000
- I'm not
the helping type, okay?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.430
And besides,
I already told you,

08:21.430 --> 08:23.130
I haven't gotten any since you.

08:28.540 --> 08:29.500
You gotta be kidding me.

08:29.500 --> 08:30.570
- What?

08:30.570 --> 08:32.110
- I just got
a new Friend Suggestion.

08:32.110 --> 08:36.140
For some solider in the Army.

08:36.140 --> 08:37.110
This doesn't make any sense.

08:37.110 --> 08:39.680
His Facebook page says
he's stationed in Iraq.

08:39.680 --> 08:42.080
- Actually, he's in New York.

08:42.080 --> 08:43.590
- How do you know that?

08:43.590 --> 08:45.150
- Because I just
gave him directions.

08:49.030 --> 08:50.030
- Where's this bar again?

08:50.030 --> 08:51.330
- It's just a few blocks down.

08:51.330 --> 08:53.030
- So how does
this whole thing work?

08:53.030 --> 08:54.360
Is the God Account
going to tell us

08:54.360 --> 08:55.360
how to help this guy, or--

08:55.360 --> 08:56.670
- Oh, no, no, no.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.100
Usually, we have to
figure it out on our own.

08:58.100 --> 08:59.300
- Super.

08:59.300 --> 09:01.600
So you really don't know
how's pulling the strings?

09:01.600 --> 09:04.040
I mean, I believe in God,
but no way this is,

09:04.040 --> 09:05.110
you know, God.

09:05.110 --> 09:06.410
- Well, on that, we can agree,

09:06.410 --> 09:08.410
not the believing in God part.

09:08.410 --> 09:10.980
Look, all I know is that
these Friend Suggestions

09:10.980 --> 09:12.620
really need our help.

09:12.620 --> 09:15.420
And hey, maybe your legal
skills will come in handy.

09:15.420 --> 09:17.420
What kind of lawyer
are you, anyway?

09:17.420 --> 09:19.260
- The kind that no longer
practices law.

09:19.260 --> 09:20.520
- What happened?

09:20.520 --> 09:23.130
- Do you always ask
this many questions?

09:23.130 --> 09:24.330
- It's a force of habit, okay?

09:24.330 --> 09:25.700
When helping people,

09:25.700 --> 09:29.070
digging into their stories
is a good place to start.

09:29.070 --> 09:31.000
- I burned out.
Needed a change.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.540
- And New York?

09:32.540 --> 09:35.500
- Seemed as good a place
as any to start over.

09:35.500 --> 09:38.010
Got here a few months ago,
took a job as a waitress

09:38.010 --> 09:41.080
so I can figure out
my next step.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.350
What about you?

09:42.350 --> 09:44.180
You always this intent
on helping people,

09:44.180 --> 09:45.680
or do you have other hobbies?

09:45.680 --> 09:48.020
- I host a podcast called
"The Millennial Prophet."

09:48.020 --> 09:49.020
- Subtle.

09:49.020 --> 09:50.050
What's it about?

09:50.050 --> 09:51.190
- The God Account.

09:52.190 --> 09:53.960
Very meta.

09:53.960 --> 09:55.560
Wait, have you talked
about me on it?

09:55.560 --> 09:57.390
- Not really,
I'm in between seasons.

09:57.390 --> 09:58.560
I'm trying to figure out

09:58.560 --> 09:59.700
what my next storyline
is gonna be.

09:59.700 --> 10:02.230
- So that's why
you were looking for me.

10:02.230 --> 10:04.230
You wanna know what my role
is in all of this

10:04.230 --> 10:05.430
for your podcast.

10:05.430 --> 10:07.570
Well, hate to break it to you,

10:07.570 --> 10:10.440
but I'm not gonna be
some character on your show.

10:10.440 --> 10:11.970
- Look, I understand
that you don't want

10:11.970 --> 10:13.240
anything to do with this,
but right now,

10:13.240 --> 10:14.210
we both need each other.

10:14.210 --> 10:15.440
- How so?

10:15.440 --> 10:16.750
- The God Account
is all about tests,

10:16.750 --> 10:18.510
and I'm hoping that this
is one of them, okay?

10:18.510 --> 10:19.550
We help Lieutenant Freemont,

10:19.550 --> 10:22.180
I am betting that we'll both
get our lives back.

10:23.720 --> 10:26.490
Sound good?

10:26.490 --> 10:27.560
Okay.

10:30.590 --> 10:32.090
- Deux cafés?

10:32.090 --> 10:34.230
- Très bien, merci.
- Merci.

10:34.230 --> 10:35.600
- Beautiful view.

10:35.600 --> 10:38.370
- So, you said there was
something I can help you with.

10:38.370 --> 10:40.540
- Yeah, yeah, there is.

10:40.540 --> 10:43.310
Part of the reason I came here
to study abroad five years ago

10:43.310 --> 10:46.040
was because I wanted
to look up a friend of my mom's

10:46.040 --> 10:47.240
who I met when I was young.

10:47.240 --> 10:48.540
She was living in Paris
at the time

10:48.540 --> 10:50.980
and I thought she might
know where my mom was.

10:50.980 --> 10:53.920
She didn't, but we ended up
getting really close

10:53.920 --> 10:56.620
and she's actually the whole
reason I became a journalist,

10:56.620 --> 10:58.320
I wanted to follow
in her footsteps.

10:58.320 --> 11:00.290
- That's not a bad
origin story.

11:00.290 --> 11:02.460
- Actually, there's more.

11:02.460 --> 11:04.260
So, a few months
after I got home,

11:04.260 --> 11:06.360
I got this Facebook message
from her

11:06.360 --> 11:09.100
saying that she heard
my mom was in New York,

11:09.100 --> 11:11.530
so after I graduated
that's where I went

11:11.530 --> 11:14.100
and eventually I met Miles who
helped me reconnect with her

11:14.100 --> 11:16.970
and it was all because of this
Facebook message Annie sent.

11:16.970 --> 11:19.410
- Wow, she must be,
uh, very gratified

11:19.410 --> 11:21.240
to have played such
an important role in your life.

11:21.240 --> 11:25.210
- Yeah, actually,
she never knew.

11:25.210 --> 11:28.020
We lost touch
after I moved to New York.

11:28.020 --> 11:29.650
And when I reconnected
with my mom,

11:29.650 --> 11:32.990
I tried to reach out to her
but I couldn't track her down.

11:32.990 --> 11:34.090
- Hmm.

11:34.090 --> 11:36.060
You have, uh,
Rakesh look into it?

11:36.060 --> 11:38.030
- Yeah, but he's
a little preoccupied.

11:38.030 --> 11:39.230
- Hey, look,
I would love to help,

11:39.230 --> 11:40.360
but I'm not a hacker.

11:40.360 --> 11:43.100
- No, no, but you are
a billionaire.

11:43.100 --> 11:44.270
Even better.

11:44.270 --> 11:45.670
Come on, Simon,
you know people.

11:45.670 --> 11:48.070
- Uh, okay, look.

11:48.070 --> 11:51.040
Why don't you tell me her name
and I'll see what I can dig up.

11:51.040 --> 11:52.240
- Thank you.

11:52.240 --> 11:54.640
Her name's Annie Keller.

11:54.640 --> 11:55.510
- All right.

11:55.510 --> 11:57.250
Well, I'll let you know
what I find out.

12:00.180 --> 12:01.220
- Hey, sweetheart.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.550
I, uh, got your message.

12:02.550 --> 12:03.550
Everything okay?

12:03.550 --> 12:04.520
- Yeah, I just--

12:04.520 --> 12:06.420
I wanted to see
how things went at the church.

12:06.420 --> 12:07.960
- Hmm?

12:07.960 --> 12:09.360
- You tie up
all those loose ends

12:09.360 --> 12:10.860
you were telling Trish about?

12:10.860 --> 12:12.090
- Was it that obvious?

12:12.090 --> 12:13.600
- Not to Trish,

12:13.600 --> 12:16.930
but I have a 24-year head-start
on decoding Arthur Finer.

12:18.500 --> 12:22.040
Trish has her heart set on us
finding a new place together.

12:22.040 --> 12:23.270
To be honest,

12:23.270 --> 12:26.440
I'm struggling with the idea
of selling my house,

12:26.440 --> 12:28.380
actually living somewhere else.

12:28.380 --> 12:30.080
I know it probably
sounds silly, but--

12:30.080 --> 12:31.510
- No.

12:31.510 --> 12:33.250
It doesn't.

12:33.250 --> 12:35.880
But I don't think
avoiding the problem

12:35.880 --> 12:36.890
is the way to handle it.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.350
- No, you're right.

12:38.350 --> 12:41.290
I need to tell her the truth.

12:43.060 --> 12:45.230
I don't want to move.

12:46.460 --> 12:47.830
- ♪ Hey, make your mind up ♪

12:47.830 --> 12:50.500
♪ Should've thought about it
before you signed up ♪

12:50.500 --> 12:53.170
♪ New lover, lot to climb up ♪

12:53.170 --> 12:54.200
♪ Too high ♪

12:54.200 --> 12:55.540
- There he is.

12:58.210 --> 12:59.240
- Okay, what's the plan?

12:59.240 --> 13:00.180
How do we get this guy to talk?

13:00.180 --> 13:01.210
- Uh...

13:01.210 --> 13:03.180
We're just here to help him,
he's not a witness.

13:03.180 --> 13:04.910
- Right, sorry.

13:04.910 --> 13:06.010
- Just follow my lead.

13:06.010 --> 13:09.620
- Never been my strong suit,
but I will give it a shot.

13:09.620 --> 13:11.190
- Hey!

13:11.190 --> 13:12.290
Lieutenant?

13:12.290 --> 13:14.190
- Hey, you're the guy
from the subway.

13:14.190 --> 13:15.190
- Yeah, Miles Finer!

13:15.190 --> 13:16.420
This is my, uh, friend, Joy.

13:16.420 --> 13:18.030
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

13:18.030 --> 13:19.130
- Hi,
Lieutenant James Freemont.

13:19.130 --> 13:20.260
This is Caffey.

13:20.260 --> 13:21.430
- Hey, how's it goin'?

13:21.430 --> 13:22.560
- Miles, uh, gave me directions

13:22.560 --> 13:24.270
when I got turned around
getting here.

13:24.270 --> 13:25.330
- Hey, can I buy you guys
another round?

13:25.330 --> 13:26.530
- Yeah, absolutely, man!
- Yeah!

13:26.530 --> 13:27.370
- Pull up a seat.

13:27.370 --> 13:29.970
- So, uh, you two
serve together?

13:29.970 --> 13:31.510
- Yeah, two tours.

13:31.510 --> 13:33.270
Until Caffey decided
to trade it all in

13:33.270 --> 13:34.410
for a clipboard and a desk.

13:34.410 --> 13:37.180
- I work in the recruitment
office in Times Square.

13:37.180 --> 13:38.350
- Okay,
and what about you, Lieutenant?

13:38.350 --> 13:39.480
How long have you been here?

13:39.480 --> 13:41.980
- I'm actually just
finishing up my leave.

13:41.980 --> 13:43.280
I ship back out tomorrow night.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.950
- So are you in town
visiting family, or...

13:44.950 --> 13:47.260
- No, he doesn't know
anyone here but me.

13:47.260 --> 13:48.190
And for the record,
I told him to go to Hawaii.

13:49.220 --> 13:50.260
- So why New York?

13:50.260 --> 13:52.090
- Ah, no reason,
I just, uh, wanted

13:52.090 --> 13:53.560
to see the sights,
you know, Times Square.

13:53.560 --> 13:55.400
- Can I ask you
a question, Lieutenant?

13:55.400 --> 13:57.170
Is there something
we can help you with?

13:57.170 --> 13:58.930
- Help me with?

13:58.930 --> 14:00.100
- Yeah, do you have some sort

14:00.100 --> 14:01.440
of trouble or problem
in your life

14:01.440 --> 14:03.370
that you think
is insurmountable in some way?

14:05.140 --> 14:06.340
- I'm--I'm sorry, I--

14:06.340 --> 14:07.940
You know what?

14:07.940 --> 14:10.310
I think it's about time
for me to get those beers.

14:10.310 --> 14:11.380
Uh, hey, Joy, you want
to come with me?

14:11.380 --> 14:13.180
- You need help getting beers?

14:13.180 --> 14:14.950
- Yeah, come with me.
Now, please.

14:20.050 --> 14:21.160
- What?

14:21.160 --> 14:22.920
I mean, he's clearly lying
about what he's doing here.

14:22.920 --> 14:24.090
Why beat around the bush?

14:24.090 --> 14:25.960
Either he has a problem
we can help him with

14:25.960 --> 14:27.430
or he doesn't.

14:27.430 --> 14:28.560
- First,

14:28.560 --> 14:30.470
of course he has a problem
that we can help him with

14:30.470 --> 14:32.200
or he wouldn't be
a Friend Suggestion,

14:32.200 --> 14:33.470
and second,

14:33.470 --> 14:36.270
they never just come out
and tell us what it is.

14:36.270 --> 14:37.940
- Whatever, I clearly don't
have the patience for this,

14:37.940 --> 14:38.970
so good luck.

14:38.970 --> 14:40.410
- I just want to help him.

14:40.410 --> 14:42.410
Why are you so against that?

14:43.510 --> 14:44.280
Miles.

14:44.280 --> 14:46.050
- No, really,
I want to know.

14:46.050 --> 14:47.580
- Miles.
- What?

14:47.580 --> 14:49.980
- Freemont's leaving.

14:51.520 --> 14:53.890
- Okay, look, if you really
want this to be over,

14:53.890 --> 14:55.060
we need to go now.

14:56.320 --> 14:57.960
- You better be right
about this.

15:05.300 --> 15:07.440
Following someone to a cemetery

15:07.440 --> 15:08.970
is not how I imagined
my day would go

15:08.970 --> 15:10.240
when I woke up this morning.

15:10.240 --> 15:12.010
- You were right,
Freemont was lying.

15:12.010 --> 15:14.110
I guess he didn't just come
to New York to see the sights.

15:21.380 --> 15:24.450
- Sergeant Joseph Stephenson.

15:24.450 --> 15:26.250
You think he has something
to do with the reason

15:26.250 --> 15:28.420
the God Account
sent us Freemont's name?

15:28.420 --> 15:31.030
- That's what
we're gonna find out.

15:37.930 --> 15:40.470
- I can't believe you finally
found Joy, that's great!

15:40.470 --> 15:42.440
- Yeah, the jury's still out
on that one.

15:42.440 --> 15:43.370
- Why are you whispering?

15:43.370 --> 15:45.440
- Well, she's in
the next room with Rakesh.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.440
They're looking into
our Friend Suggestion.

15:47.440 --> 15:49.210
- So, how'd you
get roped into this?

15:49.210 --> 15:50.280
- Oh, let's just say I have

15:50.280 --> 15:52.580
a very particular set
of skills that come in handy

15:52.580 --> 15:54.180
when we're trying to figure out
how to help someone.

15:54.180 --> 15:55.350
- You're a hacker?

15:55.350 --> 15:56.650
- I wouldn't call myself
a hacker.

15:56.650 --> 15:57.950
- Well, what do you
call yourself?

15:57.950 --> 15:59.290
- Super hacker.

15:59.290 --> 16:01.160
- So I take it you and Joy
aren't hitting it off?

16:01.160 --> 16:02.290
- Not exactly.

16:02.290 --> 16:03.860
I mean, right now
she is my only hope

16:03.860 --> 16:05.160
of keeping my podcast alive,

16:05.160 --> 16:06.390
and she pretty much

16:06.390 --> 16:08.430
wants nothing
to do with the God Account.

16:08.430 --> 16:09.400
- Speaking of which,
I've been trying

16:09.400 --> 16:11.200
to track you down for a month,

16:11.200 --> 16:13.940
and it seems like Joy Chen
doesn't really exist

16:13.940 --> 16:15.140
outside of your Facebook page.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.170
- Probably because Joy
is my middle name.

16:17.170 --> 16:19.540
Constance Joy Chen.

16:19.540 --> 16:21.510
Who's she?

16:21.510 --> 16:23.040
- Uh, that's Cara.

16:23.040 --> 16:24.950
Three of us were,
uh, kind of a team

16:24.950 --> 16:26.450
when it came
to the God Account,

16:26.450 --> 16:28.450
and then she left for Paris
right before you showed up.

16:28.450 --> 16:31.390
- Look, Miles, I know
this is hard for you,

16:31.390 --> 16:33.290
but it's gotta be hard
for her too.

16:33.290 --> 16:35.890
She's gonna need your help.

16:35.890 --> 16:37.930
- You're right.

16:37.930 --> 16:39.360
It's just, without you here,

16:39.360 --> 16:41.500
I have to get all of my advice
from Rakesh.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.930
- I gotta go.

16:42.930 --> 16:44.070
I'll talk to you later.

16:44.070 --> 16:46.200
Hey, did you find
any connection

16:46.200 --> 16:47.500
between Freemont
and Stephenson?

16:47.500 --> 16:48.570
- Mm-mm, nothing.

16:48.570 --> 16:50.940
As far as I can tell,
their paths never crossed.

16:50.940 --> 16:52.610
- Why would Freemont travel
all the way to new York

16:52.610 --> 16:55.410
to visit the grave
of a Marine he's never met?

16:55.410 --> 16:58.450
I mean, come on, we've gotta
be missing something.

16:58.450 --> 17:00.250
- Well, seems like
we're at a dead end,

17:00.250 --> 17:02.320
so text me
if you find anything.

17:02.320 --> 17:04.820
- Oh, you're leaving.
What a surprise.

17:04.820 --> 17:06.190
- No, it's not.

17:06.190 --> 17:08.120
I told you
that I would come and see

17:08.120 --> 17:10.590
what your hacker friend
could find out...

17:10.590 --> 17:12.890
which was nothing.

17:16.130 --> 17:17.370
- What?

17:17.370 --> 17:19.170
- The God Account
just liked Webster Park.

17:19.170 --> 17:20.500
Is this supposed
to mean something?

17:20.500 --> 17:22.400
- Uh, no, no.
No, no, no.

17:22.400 --> 17:25.910
Sometimes, the God Account
just likes stuff.

17:25.910 --> 17:27.310
We don't know why.

17:27.310 --> 17:31.210
But hey, we will text you
if we find anything.

17:31.210 --> 17:34.150
- Yep.
Nope, I can see myself out.

17:35.880 --> 17:38.190
- "Sometimes the God Account
just likes things,

17:38.190 --> 17:39.150
we don't know why"?

17:39.150 --> 17:40.590
What was that about?

17:40.590 --> 17:42.090
- She doesn't want this.

17:42.090 --> 17:43.220
- Bro, the God Account

17:43.220 --> 17:44.860
sent her the Friend Suggestion,
not you.

17:44.860 --> 17:47.200
She's the one who needs
to help Lieutenant Freemont

17:47.200 --> 17:49.160
and you need to help her
do that.

17:49.160 --> 17:50.400
Come on, bro, think about it.

17:50.400 --> 17:51.630
Look.

17:51.630 --> 17:53.370
She didn't get another
Friend Suggestion

17:53.370 --> 17:54.970
till the two of you
came together, right?

17:54.970 --> 17:56.200
So in my opinion,

17:56.200 --> 17:58.170
you need to be her Obi-Wan.

17:59.840 --> 18:02.140
Train her in the ways
of the Force, all right?

18:02.140 --> 18:03.850
You know, in this case,
it's the God Account.

18:03.850 --> 18:05.110
It's simple "Star Wars" math.

18:05.110 --> 18:09.150
- This is not "Star Wars,"
Rakesh, this is my life!

18:09.150 --> 18:10.420
So I'm going to prove
to the God Account

18:10.420 --> 18:12.990
that Joy is the wrong choice,
and when I do,

18:12.990 --> 18:15.290
everything's gonna go back
to the way it's supposed to be.

18:15.290 --> 18:18.130
- Mm-hmm, you're going
to Webster Park, aren't you?

18:18.130 --> 18:19.460
- Yes, I am.

18:20.860 --> 18:22.460
- That's not very Jedi of you.

18:29.770 --> 18:31.510
- Thank you for--
for coming over.

18:31.510 --> 18:33.810
- Mm-hmm.

18:33.810 --> 18:36.940
- There's something
I need to talk to you about.

18:36.940 --> 18:38.610
- Okay.

18:38.610 --> 18:39.810
- This morning,
you wanted to go over

18:39.810 --> 18:41.380
and see that apartment
and I told you

18:41.380 --> 18:43.350
I had plans
with Reverend Carver

18:43.350 --> 18:44.550
to tie up some loose ends.

18:44.550 --> 18:45.990
- Mm-hmm.

18:45.990 --> 18:48.390
- That wasn't true.

18:48.390 --> 18:49.320
- I don't understand.

18:49.320 --> 18:52.430
- I didn't want
to see the place because...

18:52.430 --> 18:54.430
I don't want to move.

18:54.430 --> 18:55.900
- Arthur...

18:55.900 --> 18:57.400
we have talked about this,

18:57.400 --> 19:00.070
we agreed that we would find
a new home together.

19:00.070 --> 19:01.370
- I know, yes, we did.

19:01.370 --> 19:02.900
It's just...

19:02.900 --> 19:06.610
wedding cakes and tuxedos
and leaving the church...

19:06.610 --> 19:08.040
it's a lot.

19:08.040 --> 19:11.080
And I'm just not ready
to move on from this house.

19:11.080 --> 19:13.650
I mean, Miles took his
first step right over there.

19:13.650 --> 19:15.450
Ella braided Ali's hair

19:15.450 --> 19:16.550
for the first time
in that chair.

19:16.550 --> 19:20.050
Everywhere I look are memories.

19:20.050 --> 19:21.560
- Yes.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.360
And they're your memories...

19:23.360 --> 19:25.030
with Ella.

19:25.030 --> 19:27.490
And I'm not asking you
to let go of them.

19:27.490 --> 19:29.760
I am asking you

19:29.760 --> 19:32.530
to make new ones with me.

19:32.530 --> 19:34.000
- And we can, right here.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.440
- No, we can't.

19:42.640 --> 19:43.810
I'm sorry, Arthur.

19:43.810 --> 19:46.750
I can't give you
what you're asking for.

19:48.780 --> 19:51.520
- So where does that leave us?

19:51.520 --> 19:53.420
- I don't know.

19:58.590 --> 20:01.560
- I, uh, found Annie.

20:01.560 --> 20:02.700
- Are you serious?

20:02.700 --> 20:04.570
- Yeah.
She's here, she's in Paris.

20:04.570 --> 20:05.970
- That's amazing!

20:05.970 --> 20:08.840
- Cara, there's something
I need to, uh, tell you.

20:08.840 --> 20:10.900
I wasn't honest
with you earlier.

20:10.900 --> 20:12.770
I know...

20:12.770 --> 20:14.810
who Annie Keller is.

20:14.810 --> 20:16.110
- Wait, what are
you talking about?

20:16.110 --> 20:19.850
- Five years ago,
she was doing a story about me.

20:19.850 --> 20:21.050
She found out
that I had stolen

20:21.050 --> 20:23.120
the Juliet code,
so she came to Paris

20:23.120 --> 20:24.920
to find Henry to confirm it.

20:24.920 --> 20:27.720
A story that
could've destroyed me.

20:27.720 --> 20:28.920
- So you killed it?

20:28.920 --> 20:31.990
- Not just the story,
but I, uh...

20:31.990 --> 20:34.600
I made sure
she was discredited.

20:34.600 --> 20:37.130
And because of me she's never
worked as a journalist again.

20:38.630 --> 20:40.130
- Cara...

20:40.130 --> 20:41.940
I'm really sorry.

20:41.940 --> 20:44.100
There are a lot of things
I did back then

20:44.100 --> 20:44.970
that I am not proud of.

20:44.970 --> 20:47.670
- Look, Simon,
I think you should go.

20:50.810 --> 20:52.810
- She's in the 17th.

21:00.750 --> 21:02.890
- ♪ Yeah ♪

21:05.830 --> 21:08.960
♪ You were new to the school
as a freshman ♪

21:10.700 --> 21:12.630
- Well, well.

21:15.900 --> 21:17.440
- What are you doing here?

21:18.610 --> 21:19.740
- I could ask you
the same thing,

21:19.740 --> 21:20.940
but I'm pretty sure
I already know.

21:20.940 --> 21:22.680
I'm assuming
the God Account

21:22.680 --> 21:25.850
doesn't just like something
for no reason.

21:25.850 --> 21:27.580
As a lawyer,
you learn pretty quickly

21:27.580 --> 21:28.750
when someone is lying to you.

21:28.750 --> 21:31.850
- It usually likes something
as a way of helping us out,

21:31.850 --> 21:33.790
pointing us
in the right direction.

21:33.790 --> 21:35.560
- I see what's going on here.

21:35.560 --> 21:36.790
You want me to fail

21:36.790 --> 21:38.630
so you can somehow
prove to the God Account

21:38.630 --> 21:41.060
that it made a mistake
in choosing me.

21:41.060 --> 21:42.600
- Didn't it?

21:44.870 --> 21:46.030
- Good game, fellas.

21:46.030 --> 21:47.600
- Just so you know,

21:47.600 --> 21:49.600
when someone tells me
I can't do something,

21:49.600 --> 21:51.970
that's exactly
when I show them I can.

21:51.970 --> 21:55.140
- What are you about to do?
Joy. Joy!

21:55.140 --> 21:56.640
- Lieutenant Freemont?

21:56.640 --> 21:58.650
Joy Chen,
we met earlier at the bar.

21:58.650 --> 22:00.410
- Yeah.

22:00.410 --> 22:01.820
What are you guys doing here?

22:01.820 --> 22:03.650
- Actually,
we came to talk to you.

22:03.650 --> 22:04.790
- About what?

22:04.790 --> 22:07.090
- Sergeant Joseph Stephenson.
Who is he?

22:07.090 --> 22:08.120
- You two been following me?

22:08.120 --> 22:10.520
- I know how this looks,
but we just want to help.

22:10.520 --> 22:11.690
How did you know
Sgt. Stephenson?

22:11.690 --> 22:13.090
- I didn't.

22:13.090 --> 22:15.530
And I suggest these little
run-ins stop happening.

22:15.530 --> 22:16.500
- So you came
all the way to New York

22:16.500 --> 22:18.700
to visit the grave
of a soldier you never knew?

22:18.700 --> 22:20.370
I don't think so.

22:23.570 --> 22:24.770
- Hey, hey, man, have a seat.

22:24.770 --> 22:26.710
- Hey, are you okay?

22:26.710 --> 22:27.810
- I can't breathe.

22:27.810 --> 22:30.380
- We need to get him
to a hospital.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.480
- I understand you two

22:33.480 --> 22:34.820
brought in Lt. James Freemont?

22:34.820 --> 22:35.980
- Yes, we did,
how's he doing?

22:35.980 --> 22:38.090
- What's your relationship
with him?

22:38.090 --> 22:39.820
- I'm his fiancée.

22:41.860 --> 22:44.830
- We ran some tests,
and your fiancé is suffering

22:44.830 --> 22:48.130
from something called
coronary microvascular disease.

22:48.130 --> 22:50.730
It's a heart condition
that's hard to detect--

22:50.730 --> 22:52.430
- That sounds pretty serious.

22:52.430 --> 22:53.700
- It can be.

22:53.700 --> 22:55.100
The disease is treatable,

22:55.100 --> 22:58.840
but James is insisting
on returning to service.

22:58.840 --> 23:00.410
You need
to convince him otherwise.

23:00.410 --> 23:01.440
- Why?

23:01.440 --> 23:02.680
- Because with his condition,

23:02.680 --> 23:06.010
the emotional
and physical stress...

23:06.010 --> 23:07.510
could kill him.

23:18.960 --> 23:20.090
- Thanks for your help.

23:20.090 --> 23:22.360
It was
just a little dehydration.

23:22.360 --> 23:24.500
- The doctor told us
about your heart condition.

23:24.500 --> 23:26.030
- Why?

23:26.030 --> 23:29.270
- We're engaged.
It's not important.

23:29.270 --> 23:31.300
- You can't go back, James.

23:31.300 --> 23:32.810
- Oh, the hell I can't.

23:32.810 --> 23:34.770
Doc says it won't even show up
on an Army physical.

23:34.770 --> 23:36.510
- That's not the point,
and you know it.

23:36.510 --> 23:38.240
- I'm not gonna let
some hiccup with my heart

23:38.240 --> 23:39.350
keep me
from serving my country.

23:39.350 --> 23:40.550
- This is more than a hiccup.

23:40.550 --> 23:42.510
If you push yourself
too hard, you could--

23:42.510 --> 23:43.550
- Die?

23:43.550 --> 23:44.380
Yeah, I made peace with that

23:44.380 --> 23:46.050
the moment I put on
this uniform.

23:46.050 --> 23:47.350
- What about
the rest of your unit?

23:47.350 --> 23:48.420
You'd be putting them at risk.

23:48.420 --> 23:50.020
- Look, I'll always
have their backs

23:50.020 --> 23:51.120
just like they'll always
have mine,

23:51.120 --> 23:52.390
end of story.

23:52.390 --> 23:53.990
- Hey, listen to me--
- No, you listen to me.

23:53.990 --> 23:56.100
You have no idea
what it's like to--

23:56.100 --> 23:58.260
to find your purpose.

23:58.260 --> 24:00.470
To know you're helping people,
making a difference,

24:00.470 --> 24:02.900
only to have someone
tell you it's over?

24:08.340 --> 24:12.880
- Actually, I know exactly
what that is like.

24:12.880 --> 24:15.080
The anger, the frustration,

24:15.080 --> 24:17.350
the fear that you don't
know who you are anymore.

24:22.020 --> 24:24.760
James...

24:24.760 --> 24:26.360
you will find your new purpose.

24:30.460 --> 24:33.100
- No, I'm a soldier.

24:33.100 --> 24:35.400
That's who I am.

24:37.100 --> 24:39.510
Ship out tomorrow night,
nothing's gonna change that.

24:41.510 --> 24:45.110
- We have to find a way
to convince him not to go back.

24:45.110 --> 24:48.410
That's what this is about.

24:48.410 --> 24:50.280
- This is too much.

24:50.280 --> 24:55.750
I-I can't have someone's life
in my hands, I...

24:58.020 --> 25:00.130
You win, Miles.

25:00.130 --> 25:01.530
You wanted the Account
all to yourself,

25:01.530 --> 25:04.200
it--it's yours.

25:04.200 --> 25:06.270
- Hey, wait, J-Joy.

25:18.910 --> 25:20.380
- Cara!

25:20.380 --> 25:21.950
- Hi, Annie.

25:23.420 --> 25:25.080
What are you doing here?

25:26.090 --> 25:28.420
- It's kind of a long story.

25:28.420 --> 25:30.220
- Well, come in.

25:30.220 --> 25:31.990
Tell me,
I want to hear everything.

25:31.990 --> 25:33.090
Wow.

25:33.090 --> 25:34.530
So you found Susan,
that's amazing!

25:34.530 --> 25:37.330
- Yeah, yeah,
and it's all because of you.

25:38.460 --> 25:41.270
I don't know what to say,
I'm just so proud of you!

25:41.270 --> 25:43.100
Look at you--
a star journalist,

25:43.100 --> 25:45.100
you have
an incredible boyfriend,

25:45.100 --> 25:46.840
a relationship with your mom.

25:46.840 --> 25:47.870
- I know.

25:47.870 --> 25:48.970
It's kind of hard to believe.

25:48.970 --> 25:50.440
- No, actually.

25:50.440 --> 25:53.110
It's exactly where
I knew you'd end up.

25:53.110 --> 25:55.780
- What about you?
How are things?

25:55.780 --> 25:57.020
- Things are great.

25:57.020 --> 25:58.450
I work in a little art gallery.

25:58.450 --> 26:00.120
Plenty of time
to enjoy the city,

26:00.120 --> 26:02.190
no stress--anyway,
what are you doing in Paris?

26:02.190 --> 26:04.790
- I'm sort of writing a book.

26:04.790 --> 26:06.460
- Really?
How Hemingway.

26:07.730 --> 26:09.330
- What's it about?

26:09.330 --> 26:12.930
- It's a biography
about a tech billionaire

26:12.930 --> 26:14.300
who's trying
to change the world.

26:14.300 --> 26:16.170
- I used to cover
the tech beat.

26:16.170 --> 26:17.670
Who is it?
Maybe I know them.

26:19.040 --> 26:20.940
- Actually, you do.

26:22.940 --> 26:25.240
It's Simon Hayes.

26:27.910 --> 26:29.280
- Simon Hayes.

26:33.990 --> 26:35.420
- Hmm, he ruined my life,

26:35.420 --> 26:37.390
but judging by the fact
that you buried the lede there,

26:37.390 --> 26:38.960
I'm guessing
you already knew that.

26:38.960 --> 26:42.290
- He just told me this morning.

26:42.290 --> 26:45.100
Look, there is no excuse
for what Simon did to you.

26:45.100 --> 26:47.370
- Is that why you came here?

26:47.370 --> 26:49.030
You want me to tell you
that it's okay?

26:49.030 --> 26:50.470
- No, I wanted to see you.

26:50.470 --> 26:51.800
- Well, you have.

26:51.800 --> 26:53.870
So...

26:53.870 --> 26:56.940
good luck with your book, Cara.

26:56.940 --> 26:58.280
You should go.

26:58.280 --> 26:59.550
- Annie.

26:59.550 --> 27:01.550
Wait, can't we talk about this?

27:01.550 --> 27:03.220
- If you're writing a book
about Simon Hayes,

27:03.220 --> 27:05.450
we have nothing to talk about.

27:08.190 --> 27:10.020
- So let me get this straight.

27:10.020 --> 27:13.060
The God Account is sending
Joy Friend Suggestions

27:13.060 --> 27:14.460
instead of you.

27:14.460 --> 27:17.160
- Yeah, except she doesn't
want the responsibility.

27:17.160 --> 27:18.260
- Well, lucky for her,
she has someone

27:18.260 --> 27:21.430
who's been down that road
and can walk her through it.

27:21.430 --> 27:22.300
Or maybe not.

27:22.300 --> 27:24.300
- Look, Dad,
I know the type of person

27:24.300 --> 27:26.210
that's right for the job,
and it is not her.

27:26.210 --> 27:28.070
- So what are you gonna do?

27:28.070 --> 27:29.940
- I have to help
Lieutenant Freemont on my own.

27:29.940 --> 27:30.940
- Oh, I see.

27:30.940 --> 27:31.940
And if you do,

27:31.940 --> 27:33.510
then the God Account sees

27:33.510 --> 27:36.050
that you are still
the right man for the job.

27:36.050 --> 27:37.350
- What's wrong with that?

27:37.350 --> 27:39.080
I've done everything
it's asked of me.

27:39.080 --> 27:42.990
- And now it's asking you
to help Joy.

27:42.990 --> 27:44.890
- Honestly, I don't know
what it's asking me.

27:44.890 --> 27:48.090
All I know is...

27:48.090 --> 27:49.530
I'm not ready to let it go.

27:49.530 --> 27:53.070
- Well.
That, I understand.

27:53.070 --> 27:54.300
- What do you mean?

27:54.300 --> 27:56.300
- Trish wants me
to sell the house

27:56.300 --> 27:58.870
and to move in
to a new home with her,

27:58.870 --> 28:00.040
and I'm not ready for that.

28:00.040 --> 28:01.410
- Why not?

28:01.410 --> 28:03.380
- I spent my life
with your mother in that house,

28:03.380 --> 28:05.380
I raised you and your sister
in that house.

28:05.380 --> 28:07.310
That house is who I am.

28:07.310 --> 28:12.050
- No, Dad, it's not, okay?
It's just a house.

28:12.050 --> 28:13.920
And the memories
you made there,

28:13.920 --> 28:15.220
you get to take them with you.

28:18.790 --> 28:20.190
- Miles.

28:20.190 --> 28:22.030
Former Reverend Finer.

28:22.030 --> 28:23.300
- What's up, Rakesh?

28:23.300 --> 28:26.300
- So, now that we know
Joy's full name,

28:26.300 --> 28:28.130
I was able to dig
into her life a little bit,

28:28.130 --> 28:30.470
and I found out
what kind of lawyer she was--

28:30.470 --> 28:32.140
a public defender.

28:32.140 --> 28:33.810
You do not do that kind of work

28:33.810 --> 28:35.810
unless you're really trying
to make a difference.

28:38.880 --> 28:41.410
- You know, all this time,

28:41.410 --> 28:45.220
you've been telling me why Joy
is wrong for the God Account.

28:45.220 --> 28:48.850
Maybe it's time to ask yourself
why she's right.

28:56.230 --> 28:58.100
- What are you doing here?

28:58.100 --> 28:59.260
- Why didn't you tell me

28:59.260 --> 29:01.200
you were a public defender
back in Chicago?

29:01.200 --> 29:02.700
- Why does it matter?

29:02.700 --> 29:05.170
- Because you said
you weren't the helping type.

29:05.170 --> 29:08.810
But your job is all about
helping those in need.

29:08.810 --> 29:10.240
Look, I was jealous

29:10.240 --> 29:13.110
that you were getting
Friend Suggestions and not me.

29:13.110 --> 29:15.410
So much so that I forgot
how hard it was

29:15.410 --> 29:17.820
when I was first asked
to do this.

29:17.820 --> 29:21.150
I wanted to run, but I didn't,
and I am telling you,

29:21.150 --> 29:23.960
it was the best decision
I have ever made in my life.

29:23.960 --> 29:25.460
- Yeah, well,

29:25.460 --> 29:28.990
I haven't been making great
life decisions lately, so--

29:28.990 --> 29:31.130
- But that's what
I'm trying to say.

29:31.130 --> 29:33.470
It's not just about
helping people,

29:33.470 --> 29:35.870
the God Account
brought Cara into my life.

29:35.870 --> 29:38.940
It even helped me fix
my relationship with my dad.

29:38.940 --> 29:41.110
- My problems...

29:41.110 --> 29:42.510
can't be fixed.

29:42.510 --> 29:44.210
- But they can!

29:44.210 --> 29:48.050
Lieutenant Freemont's problems
seem unfixable too.

29:48.050 --> 29:50.920
But if the God Account
sent us his name,

29:50.920 --> 29:52.420
then it's not.

29:52.420 --> 29:54.890
And when you see
what the God Account can do--

29:54.890 --> 29:56.920
what we can do--

29:56.920 --> 29:59.090
nothing will seem impossible.

30:01.260 --> 30:03.360
I'm heading to
the Army recruiting office

30:03.360 --> 30:07.070
to talk to Private Caffey,
see if he could help.

30:07.070 --> 30:09.400
I hope to see you there.

30:12.370 --> 30:14.940
- Wait.

30:14.940 --> 30:16.980
For the record...

30:16.980 --> 30:19.510
I'm not sold, I'm just...

30:19.510 --> 30:21.110
keeping an open mind.

30:23.980 --> 30:24.950
- Take a look at these.

30:24.950 --> 30:26.550
If you have any questions,
just give me a call.

30:26.550 --> 30:27.720
It was a pleasure.

30:29.420 --> 30:31.520
- Private Caffey.

30:31.520 --> 30:33.190
We met at Conway's bar
yesterday.

30:33.190 --> 30:35.030
- Oh, yeah, sure!

30:35.030 --> 30:37.060
Uh, Miles and Joy, right?
- Hey.

30:37.060 --> 30:38.260
- Yeah,
what are you doing here?

30:38.260 --> 30:40.000
I assume you're not here
to enlist.

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
- No, actually, we're here
about Lieutenant Freemont.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.270
- What about him?

30:44.270 --> 30:47.040
- Well, uh,
he has a heart condition,

30:47.040 --> 30:50.140
and if he returns to duty,
it could be life-threatening,

30:50.140 --> 30:52.280
so we were hoping
that you could talk to him.

30:52.280 --> 30:53.750
- There's nothing
to talk about.

30:55.050 --> 30:56.180
- Nothing to talk about?

30:56.180 --> 30:58.420
How about
his heart might explode?

30:58.420 --> 31:00.020
- Well, Freemont's
the most dedicated soldier

31:00.020 --> 31:01.150
I've ever served with,

31:01.150 --> 31:02.820
so I trust him
to make the right decision.

31:02.820 --> 31:05.160
- Yeah, but he's not.
- According to you.

31:05.160 --> 31:06.490
Is there anything else?

31:09.800 --> 31:10.960
Good.

31:10.960 --> 31:12.160
Then I suggest
you find the front door.

31:12.160 --> 31:13.500
Find it quick?

31:15.430 --> 31:17.800
- Actually,
the Military Code of Justice

31:17.800 --> 31:19.040
requires soldiers to reveal

31:19.040 --> 31:20.970
any condition that might
impede their sworn duty.

31:20.970 --> 31:23.380
Withholding said information
is grounds for court martial,

31:23.380 --> 31:26.210
and since you now know
about his condition,

31:26.210 --> 31:27.410
that makes you an accessory

31:27.410 --> 31:31.480
and subject
to court martial as well.

31:31.480 --> 31:33.050
- Look, I want to help,

31:33.050 --> 31:34.820
but the Army's everything
to Freemont.

31:34.820 --> 31:36.390
He's not gonna listen to me.

31:36.390 --> 31:38.820
- Yeah, well, is there anyone
that he will listen to?

31:38.820 --> 31:40.260
- Actually, there's a woman

31:40.260 --> 31:41.890
that he met
during our second tour,

31:41.890 --> 31:43.230
Rose.

31:43.230 --> 31:45.000
Technically,
they haven't actually met.

31:45.000 --> 31:45.960
- What does that mean?

31:45.960 --> 31:47.870
- She was a volunteer
with The Soldier's Aid.

31:47.870 --> 31:50.100
It's a service that pairs
civilians with soldiers.

31:50.100 --> 31:52.270
They write letters,
they send care packages.

31:52.270 --> 31:54.010
Freemont and Rose started
emailing each other.

31:54.010 --> 31:55.270
They fell in love.

31:55.270 --> 31:56.580
It's the first time
I ever heard him talk about

31:56.580 --> 31:57.580
a life outside the Army.

31:57.580 --> 31:59.280
- And what happened?

31:59.280 --> 32:01.850
- She broke it off with him
six months ago.

32:01.850 --> 32:03.080
I don't know why.

32:03.080 --> 32:04.380
But he was devastated.

32:04.380 --> 32:06.080
- Do you know Rose's last name?

32:06.080 --> 32:07.390
- Yeah, Stephenson.

32:07.390 --> 32:09.350
- Stephenson?

32:09.350 --> 32:10.890
- That was the last name
on the grave

32:10.890 --> 32:12.960
that Freemont visited.

32:12.960 --> 32:14.090
- Looks like
you guys were right.

32:14.090 --> 32:15.760
Rose is Joseph
Stephenson's sister,

32:15.760 --> 32:16.660
and she lives in New York.

32:16.660 --> 32:18.200
- Well, that's why
Freemont came here.

32:18.200 --> 32:19.330
He was hoping to see her.

32:19.330 --> 32:21.170
- I wonder
what happened between them.

32:21.170 --> 32:23.070
- It says her brother
passed away six months ago.

32:23.070 --> 32:24.340
That's around the same time

32:24.340 --> 32:25.540
she broke things off
with Freemont.

32:25.540 --> 32:28.370
- She probably didn't want to
lose another person she loved.

32:28.370 --> 32:31.010
- That's what the God Account
wanted us to know.

32:31.010 --> 32:32.310
We have to bring them
back together

32:32.310 --> 32:33.980
and show Freemont
that he can have a life

32:33.980 --> 32:35.380
outside of the Army--

32:35.380 --> 32:36.980
with Rose.

32:36.980 --> 32:38.780
- Rakesh, now would be
a good time

32:38.780 --> 32:39.990
to use those acquired skills.

32:39.990 --> 32:41.820
- Already on it.

32:41.820 --> 32:44.260
Oh, you guys are not
gonna believe this.

32:44.260 --> 32:46.990
Rose is not in New York.

32:46.990 --> 32:48.530
She's in Paris.

32:51.060 --> 32:52.130
- Hey.

32:52.130 --> 32:53.530
I just got up, what's going on?

32:53.530 --> 32:56.840
- Do you have some time
to work on a God Account case?

33:03.510 --> 33:06.080
- All right, so Caffey said
that Lieutenant Freemont

33:06.080 --> 33:07.610
wanted to check out
Times Square before he left,

33:07.610 --> 33:09.150
so he has to be here somewhere.

33:09.150 --> 33:10.450
- Okay, well, even if he is,

33:10.450 --> 33:12.520
you think that Cara
can track down Rose in time?

33:12.520 --> 33:14.090
- Uh, yes.

33:14.090 --> 33:15.120
She's going to FaceTime me

33:15.120 --> 33:17.190
as soon as she gets
to her hotel

33:17.190 --> 33:20.260
and hopefully Rose can
convince him not to ship out.

33:20.260 --> 33:22.260
- Well, assuming
we can find him.

33:22.260 --> 33:24.300
in the middle of Times Square,

33:24.300 --> 33:25.730
at night.

33:28.230 --> 33:29.230
- Look.

33:31.670 --> 33:32.740
Hey!

33:32.740 --> 33:35.240
We need to talk.
- You two again?

33:35.240 --> 33:37.810
There's nothing you can say
that'll change my mind.

33:37.810 --> 33:40.140
- We know about Rose
and her brother

33:40.140 --> 33:41.550
and why she broke things off.

33:41.550 --> 33:43.450
- You still love her,
don't you?

33:43.450 --> 33:44.820
- It doesn't matter.

33:44.820 --> 33:47.290
- No, it is
the only thing that matters.

33:47.290 --> 33:49.290
Now, look, I know
this is gonna sound crazy,

33:49.290 --> 33:51.690
but my girlfriend Cara
is trying to track down Rose

33:51.690 --> 33:52.690
right now in Paris.

33:52.690 --> 33:54.390
- Wait, Paris?
- Not important.

33:54.390 --> 33:56.090
At any moment,
she's going to FaceTime me.

33:56.090 --> 33:58.260
All you have to do

33:58.260 --> 33:59.260
is talk to her.

33:59.260 --> 34:00.500
- I can't.

34:00.500 --> 34:04.140
When she broke things off,
she told me not to contact her.

34:04.140 --> 34:06.100
Look, I made my decision,
it's too late.

34:06.100 --> 34:09.070
- That's not why
you won't talk to her.

34:09.070 --> 34:10.340
You won't talk to her

34:10.340 --> 34:13.580
because you're afraid
that it isn't too late.

34:13.580 --> 34:16.510
Most people don't understand
how frightening hope can be,

34:16.510 --> 34:19.250
but I do.

34:19.250 --> 34:21.620
You have a chance
to reconnect with her.

34:21.620 --> 34:24.720
Don't waste it.

34:26.390 --> 34:29.130
- Oh, hey, hey, Cara!

34:29.130 --> 34:30.430
- Miles, I'm sorry,

34:30.430 --> 34:32.660
Rose checked out
of her hotel yesterday.

34:35.300 --> 34:38.740
- Well, for a minute there,
you had me believing.

34:38.740 --> 34:40.070
Guess that's that.

34:42.470 --> 34:44.180
- Miles, what's hap--

34:50.150 --> 34:51.550
- What's going on, Miles?

34:51.550 --> 34:53.720
- I have no idea.

35:04.360 --> 35:07.030
- Holy... crap.

35:07.030 --> 35:08.500
- How is this possible?

35:08.500 --> 35:10.640
- The God Account?

35:10.640 --> 35:13.470
- James!
James.

35:15.740 --> 35:18.380
- Rose!

35:18.380 --> 35:20.580
What are you doing here?

35:20.580 --> 35:21.780
- Me?

35:21.780 --> 35:23.110
You're the one
on the jumbotron!

35:23.110 --> 35:24.520
I just got back in
from out of town

35:24.520 --> 35:26.120
and I was passing by

35:26.120 --> 35:29.350
and I look up
and I see you 40 feet high!

35:29.350 --> 35:32.790
I-I thought
I might be dreaming.

35:32.790 --> 35:34.530
- Maybe we are.

35:36.060 --> 35:39.360
- It's really nice to
finally meet you, Lieutenant.

35:39.360 --> 35:42.230
- Actually, uh...

35:42.230 --> 35:44.840
I'm not gonna be a Lieutenant
much longer.

35:44.840 --> 35:46.670
I've decided
I'm leaving the Army.

35:46.670 --> 35:48.540
I wanna start a new life,

35:48.540 --> 35:49.810
and I want you to be in it.

35:49.810 --> 35:52.240
I have never stopped
loving you, Rose,

35:52.240 --> 35:54.850
and I hope
you still feel the same.

36:07.590 --> 36:09.630
- Whoo!

36:14.530 --> 36:16.600
See?
I told you.

36:16.600 --> 36:18.500
Nothing is impossible.

36:22.140 --> 36:25.280
Does it always feel like this?

36:25.280 --> 36:26.410
- Uh, yeah.

36:26.410 --> 36:28.110
Yeah, it does.

36:28.110 --> 36:31.350
- Now I know why you wanted
to keep it all to yourself.

36:31.350 --> 36:33.150
- Can I ask you something?

36:33.150 --> 36:36.050
What did you mean when
you told Lieutenant Freemont

36:36.050 --> 36:40.430
you understood
how frightening hope could be?

36:43.830 --> 36:47.330
- I have a daughter.

36:47.330 --> 36:52.540
I gave her up for adoption
when she was born.

36:52.540 --> 36:54.540
I was 16.

36:54.540 --> 36:57.780
I wasn't ready.

36:59.110 --> 37:01.710
She's the reason
I'm here in New York.

37:01.710 --> 37:03.410
- To find her?
- Yeah.

37:03.410 --> 37:05.120
I didn't burn out.

37:05.120 --> 37:09.350
I loved my job,
I love helping people.

37:11.460 --> 37:12.760
But I had to make a choice.

37:12.760 --> 37:15.560
- And what do you think?

37:15.560 --> 37:18.230
Did you make the right choice?

37:18.230 --> 37:20.700
- You really ask a lot
of questions, Miles.

37:24.400 --> 37:25.570
So what happens now?

37:25.570 --> 37:28.440
- Honestly?

37:28.440 --> 37:29.510
I don't know.

37:29.510 --> 37:33.680
- You're still gonna help me
with all of this, right?

37:33.680 --> 37:35.310
- For as long as you need.

37:36.450 --> 37:39.380
- Look, I think that

37:39.380 --> 37:40.750
it's time for both of us

37:40.750 --> 37:43.820
to start accepting
what our new roles are.

37:46.220 --> 37:47.160
- Hey, it's cool

37:47.160 --> 37:49.290
if you want to talk about me
on your podcast.

37:49.290 --> 37:51.160
- Yeah?

37:51.160 --> 37:53.460
- I'm just gonna need you
to sign an NDA on a few things.

37:53.460 --> 37:54.570
- Not signing an NDA.

37:54.570 --> 37:56.470
- Yes!
Yes, you are.

37:56.470 --> 37:59.270
- No!
- Yes, you are.

37:59.770 --> 38:03.170
- ♪ Don't let go again ♪

38:05.740 --> 38:06.740
- I got your message.

38:06.740 --> 38:08.750
So what--
what are we doing here?

38:08.750 --> 38:11.520
- This is the house
that you wanted us to look at,

38:11.520 --> 38:13.150
so I came to see it for myself.

38:13.150 --> 38:14.890
When I did,

38:14.890 --> 38:18.260
it dawned on me that it's
a few blocks from the church,

38:18.260 --> 38:20.160
around the corner
from Sylvia's,

38:20.160 --> 38:22.090
and the park
where I play chess.

38:22.090 --> 38:24.560
- That's why I was
so interested in it,

38:24.560 --> 38:26.930
because I knew
moving out of your home

38:26.930 --> 38:28.130
wouldn't be easy for you.

38:28.130 --> 38:30.030
- I'm sorry I didn't
see that sooner.

38:30.030 --> 38:33.170
- And I'm sorry for not
wanting to compromise on this.

38:33.170 --> 38:35.210
- I-I'm glad you didn't.

38:35.210 --> 38:38.710
It is why I love you,
and you were right.

38:38.710 --> 38:40.780
We need a place
to make our own memories,

38:40.780 --> 38:44.620
and I think that this home is
the perfect place to do that.

38:44.620 --> 38:47.180
- And I thought that too.

38:47.180 --> 38:49.790
But as you can see,
someone already bought it.

38:49.790 --> 38:50.890
- I know.

38:50.890 --> 38:52.160
I bought it.

38:53.690 --> 38:55.760
- What?

38:55.760 --> 38:58.800
- This is incredible! What?

38:58.800 --> 39:00.060
- Ah!

39:00.060 --> 39:03.170
- So, you gonna be okay
passing the torch to Joy?

39:03.170 --> 39:05.900
- Yeah, I think so.

39:05.900 --> 39:07.570
- Oh, I saw the video

39:07.570 --> 39:09.540
of Lieutenant Freemont
and Rose went viral.

39:09.540 --> 39:10.970
That must've been amazing
to be there.

39:10.970 --> 39:12.040
- Yeah, yeah, it was.

39:12.040 --> 39:13.280
It was.

39:13.280 --> 39:15.210
- Yeah, for a second,
it was kinda like

39:15.210 --> 39:16.680
I was back on the team.

39:16.680 --> 39:19.820
- Hey, you'll always
be a part of the team.

39:21.750 --> 39:24.520
- Oh, um, I gotta go,
but I'll call you later.

39:24.520 --> 39:25.860
- Yeah,
I'll talk to you later.

39:27.860 --> 39:29.060
- Hey.

39:29.060 --> 39:30.890
- I have been thinking
about you

39:30.890 --> 39:32.860
since you left my apartment.

39:32.860 --> 39:34.770
- Do you want to come in?

39:39.240 --> 39:40.940
I'm not proud
of the way I acted

39:40.940 --> 39:43.910
and, um, I'm sorry.

39:43.910 --> 39:47.010
- Hey, don't be, okay?

39:47.010 --> 39:48.550
It was a lot to take in.

39:48.550 --> 39:50.010
- I just haven't thought
about these things

39:50.010 --> 39:51.780
in a very long time.

39:51.780 --> 39:54.020
- I get it.
- Can we start again?

39:54.020 --> 39:55.150
- I would love that.

39:56.950 --> 39:57.920
By the way, you said

39:57.920 --> 40:00.020
something yesterday
that I didn't understand,

40:00.020 --> 40:01.790
that because of me
you found Susan?

40:01.790 --> 40:02.790
What did you mean?

40:02.790 --> 40:03.790
- Oh, well,

40:03.790 --> 40:05.830
the Facebook message
you sent me five years ago

40:05.830 --> 40:07.300
saying you heard my mom
moved to New York.

40:07.300 --> 40:08.770
- I never sent
a Facebook message

40:08.770 --> 40:10.100
about your mom
being in New York.

40:10.100 --> 40:11.600
I didn't have any idea
where she was

40:11.600 --> 40:12.940
until you told me yesterday.

40:12.940 --> 40:14.740
- But it came
from your Facebook account.

40:17.310 --> 40:19.810
If you didn't send it,
then who did?

40:21.780 --> 40:24.680
- A lot has happened
since I last recorded,

40:24.680 --> 40:26.580
but I'll get into the details
in a bit.

40:26.580 --> 40:28.350
I have been obsessed
with delivering you

40:28.350 --> 40:30.650
the best season two

40:30.650 --> 40:32.960
that I forgot
the most important lesson

40:32.960 --> 40:34.360
from season one:

40:34.360 --> 40:35.590
helping people.

40:35.590 --> 40:37.030
Because when you do,

40:37.030 --> 40:39.200
when you put others
before yourself,

40:39.200 --> 40:41.330
good things always happen.

40:41.330 --> 40:43.270
- Private.

40:43.270 --> 40:44.670
Rose, this is Caffey.

40:44.670 --> 40:45.870
- It's nice to meet you.

40:45.870 --> 40:47.170
- Nice to meet you.

40:47.170 --> 40:48.110
- So what'd you want
to see me about?

40:48.110 --> 40:49.670
- So I spoke to the head
of Army recruiting,

40:49.670 --> 40:50.810
told him all about you.

40:50.810 --> 40:51.880
What do you say?

40:51.880 --> 40:54.080
Wanna put that uniform back on
and change some lives?

40:55.380 --> 40:56.380
- Absolutely.

40:58.150 --> 40:59.220
- And most of the time,

40:59.220 --> 41:01.190
we learn something new
about ourselves,

41:01.190 --> 41:04.560
about what we're willing
to give up to move forward.

41:04.560 --> 41:09.290
I'm not saying that this
is an easy thing to do.

41:09.290 --> 41:12.860
Taking that next step
never is.

41:12.860 --> 41:15.000
But sometimes,
looking into your past

41:15.000 --> 41:17.300
is the only way
to discover your future.

41:17.300 --> 41:20.240
- Hey, I got your message.

41:20.240 --> 41:22.170
Look.

41:22.170 --> 41:23.810
I'm really sorry about Annie.

41:23.810 --> 41:24.540
- I know you are,

41:24.540 --> 41:26.240
but that's not
why I texted you.

41:26.240 --> 41:27.340
- What's going on?

41:27.340 --> 41:29.710
- I talked with Annie,
and it turns out

41:29.710 --> 41:31.110
she never sent me
that Facebook message

41:31.110 --> 41:32.320
about my mom being in New York.

41:32.320 --> 41:33.520
- Who did?

41:33.520 --> 41:36.050
- Somebody who had the ability
to hack her Facebook account.

41:36.050 --> 41:39.220
Somebody who wanted me
in New York to find my mom,

41:39.220 --> 41:41.160
and most importantly,
to meet Miles?

41:41.160 --> 41:42.360
- You think it was
the God Account.

41:42.360 --> 41:43.930
- If I'm right,
that means the God Account

41:43.930 --> 41:45.200
has been pulling the strings

41:45.200 --> 41:47.100
for a lot longer
than we ever imagined,

41:47.100 --> 41:48.630
and maybe it still is.

41:48.630 --> 41:52.640
Simon, I don't think I'm here
just to write your book.

41:52.640 --> 41:55.640
I think the God Account wants
me here for something bigger.

41:55.640 --> 41:57.670
- I don't know where
I'm supposed to go from here.

41:57.670 --> 41:59.310
All I know is that I am ready

41:59.310 --> 42:02.680
to pass along everything
that I learned to Joy.

42:02.680 --> 42:05.250
And as for what
comes next for me,

42:05.250 --> 42:07.050
that's what I gotta figure out.

42:07.050 --> 42:09.550
And when I do...

42:09.550 --> 42:11.620
you'll be first to know.

42:11.620 --> 42:14.220
- ♪ Right next to me ♪

42:17.030 --> 42:18.030
- Hoo.

42:18.030 --> 42:19.630
Yo, you ready?

42:19.630 --> 42:21.270
- Yeah.
- I'm starving.

42:26.170 --> 42:27.600
- ♪ I'm only human after all ♪

42:27.600 --> 42:28.940
- Miles?
- Mm-hmm?

42:28.940 --> 42:30.670
- ♪ Don't put the blame
on me ♪

42:30.670 --> 42:32.180
- Please tell me
you were listening to that.

42:32.180 --> 42:33.280
- I wasn't.

42:36.250 --> 42:37.780
- ♪ I'm only human ♪
- Look.

42:37.780 --> 42:40.650
The God Account left
a message on your wall.

42:40.650 --> 42:43.720
- "Follow the Lady.
Find your Path."

42:43.720 --> 42:45.260
W-w-what do you think it means?

42:45.260 --> 42:47.990
- I don't know, Miles.

42:47.990 --> 42:49.790
I do know one thing, though.

42:49.790 --> 42:53.600
I don't think the God Account
is done with you just yet.
