WEBVTT

00:05.047 --> 00:07.539
No, Mom, I'm not
moving to New York.

00:07.633 --> 00:10.046
It's just
a short-term gig.

00:10.135 --> 00:12.718
I can still watch
Mr. Jingles next month.

00:14.139 --> 00:15.596
Uh, hopefully it leads
to more work

00:15.682 --> 00:17.264
with Blue Annex Technologies.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.684
I just spent three weeks
getting security clearances.

00:19.770 --> 00:22.228
This could open
a lot of doors for me.

00:22.314 --> 00:24.101
Yep. Uh-huh.

00:25.567 --> 00:26.728
Yeah. Yeah.

00:26.818 --> 00:28.775
Yeah, I meet
my supervisor tomorrow.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.148
He's from Silicon Valley.

00:30.239 --> 00:31.855
Cool, right?

00:31.949 --> 00:33.531
All right.

00:33.617 --> 00:35.654
All right.

00:35.744 --> 00:38.657
Mom, you're killin' me.
I gotta go.

00:38.747 --> 00:40.283
I love you.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.115
Unbelievable.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:02.354 --> 01:03.354
Hello?

01:05.816 --> 01:08.308
Is anybody in here?

01:17.244 --> 01:19.156
There's a monster
under the bed!

01:20.539 --> 01:22.121
There she is.

01:22.207 --> 01:23.994
You're so good at this.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.436
All right, you wanna
go get your dad?

01:25.460 --> 01:26.701
- Yeah!
- Let's go.

01:26.795 --> 01:29.162
Come on.

01:30.591 --> 01:31.957
Uh-oh! Look who
found the monster!

01:32.050 --> 01:33.166
Yeah!

01:33.260 --> 01:35.047
Bethany is very good
at Hide and Seek.

01:35.137 --> 01:37.017
Well, that's because
that little monster's daddy

01:37.097 --> 01:38.554
showed her the best
places to hide.

01:38.640 --> 01:41.053
Didn't I?

01:43.270 --> 01:44.706
- Do you want to go back there?
- She's my monster!

01:44.730 --> 01:46.517
- Mwah, mwah, mwah! Okay...
- Yes!

01:46.607 --> 01:48.459
- Front, that's a good hiding spot.
- All right, you know what?

01:48.483 --> 01:50.065
We're gonna go play
some computer stuff,

01:50.152 --> 01:51.671
- you little smarty-pants.
- Oh, really? Wow.

01:51.695 --> 01:53.482
Okay, so I made some
slight adjustments

01:53.572 --> 01:55.689
to your pizzeria order...
you're welcome.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.148
What adjustments?

01:57.242 --> 01:59.234
I, uh, added some
wagyu beef tartare

01:59.328 --> 02:00.847
and some lobster sushi.
I thought it'd be fun.

02:00.871 --> 02:02.863
Uh, Vito's doesn't
make that.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.163
Okay, so by "adjusted"
I meant

02:04.249 --> 02:05.740
"cancelled and
completely reimagined."

02:05.834 --> 02:08.076
Did you reimagine
who's going to pay for it?

02:08.169 --> 02:09.229
What kind of jerk
do you take me for?

02:09.253 --> 02:10.745
I wouldn't
snatch the bill

02:10.839 --> 02:12.000
out of the hands
of the hosts

02:12.090 --> 02:14.485
of a party. That's just rude.
Don't worry, I ordered a little

02:14.509 --> 02:17.422
caviar and crackers
for Bethany.

02:17.512 --> 02:19.799
Uh, we can hardly afford
the pizza.

02:19.890 --> 02:21.131
- We'll catch up.
- Yeah.

02:21.224 --> 02:23.181
Your mom really
needed that money.

02:23.268 --> 02:25.476
Speaking of,
have you heard from her?

02:25.562 --> 02:28.805
I did. She's working
through the steps, I guess.

02:28.899 --> 02:31.892
Makes giving away
our life savings to save her...

02:31.985 --> 02:33.476
kind of worth it.

02:33.570 --> 02:35.562
Well, who needs money
when we have all of this?

02:37.199 --> 02:39.737
Oh, well,
look who finally decided to show up.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.387
Hey, I was trying to be
a good houseguest

02:41.411 --> 02:43.403
and let Reade get ready first.
Mistake.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.058
So,
the whole "Laverne & Shirley" act

02:45.082 --> 02:46.684
doesn't extend to showering together.
Got it.

02:46.708 --> 02:48.415
- Easy.
- We're not at work.

02:48.502 --> 02:49.937
I'm off-duty. I can say
inappropriate things.

02:49.961 --> 02:51.327
Forgot your phone.

02:51.421 --> 02:54.380
You got a calendar alert
for a meeting with Lexi?

02:54.466 --> 02:56.708
Oh, so showering
together is a no-no,

02:56.802 --> 02:58.404
but you can still creep
on each other's phones?

02:58.428 --> 03:00.198
I'm meeting up with an old
college friend for coffee.

03:00.222 --> 03:01.713
- So, a date.
- No.

03:01.807 --> 03:03.493
I'm meeting up with an old
college friend for coffee.

03:03.517 --> 03:04.724
"A," you don't
drink coffee.

03:04.810 --> 03:06.551
"B," Lexi rhymes
with sexy.

03:06.645 --> 03:07.931
I'm gonna get
another beer.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.248
Anybody want something?

03:09.272 --> 03:10.683
You're so good.

03:10.774 --> 03:11.834
Is that another tattoo hit?

03:11.858 --> 03:14.896
Uh, no. It's a message
from Cook Federal Pen.

03:14.986 --> 03:16.773
A prisoner claims
to have valuable intel

03:16.863 --> 03:18.354
but will only talk to us.

03:18.448 --> 03:19.967
Okay, set something up
for the morning.

03:19.991 --> 03:21.607
I don't think this can wait.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.113
He claims it's time-sensitive

03:23.203 --> 03:24.739
and needs to talk
to us tonight.

03:24.830 --> 03:26.446
Who's the prisoner?

03:28.542 --> 03:29.908
Sho Ahktar.

03:30.001 --> 03:32.084
To what do we owe
the displeasure?

03:32.170 --> 03:34.082
- Friends!
- Friends?

03:34.172 --> 03:35.834
Last time we met,
you were trying to steal

03:35.924 --> 03:38.758
an NSA computer virus
to kill all of us.

03:38.844 --> 03:40.676
Doesn't mean
I haven't missed you.

03:40.762 --> 03:43.254
Even Rich the Snitch.

03:43.348 --> 03:47.388
Seems like suckling from the teat
of Big Brother has its privileges.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.184
Better than rottin' away
in a prison cell.

03:49.271 --> 03:51.354
What is that shade of eye shadow called,
by the way?

03:51.440 --> 03:52.917
- "Midnight Punch in the Face"?
- Okay!

03:52.941 --> 03:54.502
You said you wanted
to talk. Start talkin'.

03:54.526 --> 03:56.062
Before I do, I need you

03:56.153 --> 03:57.630
to promise me
witness protection in writing,

03:57.654 --> 03:58.895
round the clock security...

03:58.989 --> 04:00.509
Well,
that's not how this works.

04:00.574 --> 04:01.759
You need to give us
something that bears fruit,

04:01.783 --> 04:03.524
then we'll talk deals.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.028
Before I was arrested
a year ago

04:07.122 --> 04:08.909
for the tiniest of crimes,

04:08.999 --> 04:10.615
I was snatched up
along with some members

04:10.709 --> 04:13.417
of a very high-profile client
I was selling to.

04:13.503 --> 04:16.120
Part of a terrorist group
called the D...

04:20.051 --> 04:21.632
So, a terrorist group
called what?

04:21.720 --> 04:24.633
Called the Dab...

04:26.224 --> 04:27.965
One more time?

04:28.059 --> 04:29.550
I got this.

04:30.854 --> 04:33.062
Hold the work!
Please!

04:37.110 --> 04:38.567
Go ahead.

04:38.653 --> 04:41.896
Part of a terrorist group
called the Dabbur Zann.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.197
But that was
just for starters.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.775
They also wanted
an Nash-Shab weapons system.

04:45.869 --> 04:47.138
And they thought
you could get them

04:47.162 --> 04:48.698
an anti-tank missile?

04:48.789 --> 04:50.826
I could have gotten them one.
They wanted ten.

04:50.916 --> 04:53.750
But I got pinched
before I could source them.

04:53.835 --> 04:55.229
Okay, I'm still
waiting for the part

04:55.253 --> 04:57.093
where you offer us even
a tiny morsel of fruit.

04:58.256 --> 04:59.463
I overheard some chatter today

04:59.549 --> 05:01.256
from the guys
I got arrested with.

05:01.343 --> 05:02.629
Sounds like the Dabbur Zann

05:02.719 --> 05:04.335
got their missiles
from another seller.

05:04.429 --> 05:06.216
- Who?
- I don't know.

05:06.306 --> 05:09.515
I tried to ask,
casually bring it up, but...

05:09.601 --> 05:11.388
You got beaten to a pulp?

05:11.478 --> 05:14.290
You should take a class on snitching or
something. You're not very good at it.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.459
I tried to sign up for yours at the
learning annex, but it was all full.

05:16.483 --> 05:17.849
All right,
is that all you have?

05:17.943 --> 05:19.003
Did I mention the part
where they're planning

05:19.027 --> 05:21.144
an attack in New York?

05:21.238 --> 05:22.445
When?

05:22.531 --> 05:25.148
Tonight. Tomorrow.

05:25.242 --> 05:26.949
Sounded like it was
already in motion.

05:27.035 --> 05:29.180
I'm not giving any deals until you
give us something more concrete,

05:29.204 --> 05:31.321
something better than
tonight or tomorrow.

05:31.414 --> 05:32.621
Take him to interrogation.

05:32.707 --> 05:34.414
Yeah.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.378
Sho's laptop was confiscated

05:40.465 --> 05:42.297
when he was arrested...
no one could crack it.

05:42.384 --> 05:43.444
You guys want to take
a run at it?

05:43.468 --> 05:45.175
That's gonna be
easier said than done.

05:45.262 --> 05:47.299
- Yeah.
- All right.

05:51.184 --> 05:54.177
This is not the best day
to rely on the computing power

05:54.271 --> 05:56.604
of the New York office
of the FBI.

05:56.690 --> 05:59.433
Look at this. This is literally...
literally... my worst nightmare.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.859
I delayed the Blue Annex
upgrade as long as I could.

06:01.945 --> 06:03.785
We're the last government
agency to install it.

06:03.822 --> 06:07.361
Watching the custom network
that I built from scratch

06:07.450 --> 06:09.362
get replaced by
a tech conglomerate's

06:09.452 --> 06:11.364
uninspired
cloud-based system

06:11.454 --> 06:12.786
is a special kind of torture.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.350
Well, for what it's worth,
at least you know

06:14.374 --> 06:15.434
the new system
is gonna have a ton of...

06:15.458 --> 06:17.199
Bugs? Yeah,
I'm getting itchy

06:17.294 --> 06:18.938
just thinking about the patches
that I'll have to code.

06:18.962 --> 06:20.439
Well, there's worse
reasons to be itchy.

06:20.463 --> 06:21.999
Look, just make do
with what you got.

06:22.090 --> 06:24.173
We need results, fast.
Keep me updated.

06:24.259 --> 06:26.592
Yeah, okay, I'll send you
a carrier pigeon.

06:26.678 --> 06:27.885
Hey, Briana, uh...

06:27.971 --> 06:29.837
are you on
babysitting duty?

06:29.931 --> 06:32.514
I'm the FBI's official
liaison to Blue Annex, yes.

06:32.601 --> 06:33.717
You need something?

06:33.810 --> 06:35.221
Who's in charge
of these guys?

06:35.312 --> 06:37.144
Leonard Perkins.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.062
Perkins? Really?

06:39.149 --> 06:40.640
The guy who coded
this whole atrocity

06:40.734 --> 06:42.817
is actually here in person?
Wow.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.690
Patterson.

06:45.989 --> 06:47.150
Perkins.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.947
I found an old module
you built.

06:49.034 --> 06:50.386
Had to rip it
right out of the wall.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.526
It's impressive.

06:51.620 --> 06:52.805
You should donate it
to a museum.

06:54.331 --> 06:56.573
Listen, I will take
my 2011 tech

06:56.666 --> 06:59.033
over your new
monstrosities any day.

06:59.127 --> 07:01.710
Help yourself.
It's in the trash if you want it.

07:01.796 --> 07:04.539
Okay, hey, um...

07:04.633 --> 07:08.001
I'm gonna need major computing
power in my lab tonight.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.960
And I'm gonna need
your lab empty.

07:10.055 --> 07:11.637
All agents and staff
were instructed

07:11.723 --> 07:13.635
to clear out for the weekend
so we could work.

07:13.725 --> 07:16.889
Something came up,
and it can't wait.

07:16.978 --> 07:18.514
Well, it's gonna have to.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.471
We just started the system
by system reboot.

07:20.565 --> 07:21.897
I can't stop it
in the middle.

07:21.983 --> 07:24.896
Just give me fair warning
when you knock out my lab

07:24.986 --> 07:26.477
and put it under
the knife, please.

07:26.571 --> 07:29.359
Look, the good news is,
once we do shut you down,

07:29.449 --> 07:31.361
it should only be
for ten minutes.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.568
Great.
I can't wait.

07:35.205 --> 07:37.413
Hey. Hey!
The relay goes upstairs.

07:37.499 --> 07:39.101
Yeah, I got this.
He's one of my new guys.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.162
Decker, you heard her.
Upstairs.

08:00.021 --> 08:01.040
I'll be back to check on it.

08:01.064 --> 08:03.147
Great, thanks.
This is Briana.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.193
<i>Have you thought
about my offer?</i>

08:05.235 --> 08:07.075
I'm at work. I can't talk
about this right now.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.735
We're out of time.
I need to know.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.484
Are you in, or out?

08:10.573 --> 08:11.780
I don't even know
who you are.

08:11.866 --> 08:13.357
<i>I know who you are.</i>

08:13.451 --> 08:14.783
Do they?

08:14.869 --> 08:16.451
<i>Or do they look
right through you?</i>

08:16.538 --> 08:18.404
You're asking me
to betray everyone.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.239
I'm asking you to
realize your potential.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.450
It's time you get
the respect you deserve.

08:22.544 --> 08:25.161
Not to mention
a very generous paycheck.

08:25.255 --> 08:26.416
<i>It's up to you, Briana.</i>

08:26.506 --> 08:28.623
<i>But I need an answer...
today.</i>

08:31.845 --> 08:33.962
Briana! I was
looking for you.

08:34.054 --> 08:35.511
- You were?
- Yeah.

08:35.597 --> 08:37.076
We have reason to believe
the Dabbur Zann

08:37.100 --> 08:38.900
is gonna carry out
another attack in New York.

08:38.934 --> 08:40.551
And obviously,
we're short-staffed,

08:40.645 --> 08:42.807
so I was hoping you could
help us out tonight.

08:42.897 --> 08:44.854
Uh, sure.
Wh-what do you need?

08:44.941 --> 08:46.898
Rich and Patterson will
catch you up in the lab.

08:46.985 --> 08:48.521
I'm on my way.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.984
Hmm. What is this code
supposed to be?

08:53.074 --> 08:54.565
Hey, get your paws
off my stuff!

08:54.659 --> 08:56.321
It looks like a game.
Are you and Boston

08:56.411 --> 08:58.152
writing a Wizardville
sequel without me?

08:58.246 --> 08:59.807
No, it has nothing
to do with Wizardville.

08:59.831 --> 09:02.574
I am making a puzzle-solving
app for Bethany.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.249
Okay, that's
super adorable.

09:04.335 --> 09:06.655
Sounds like you're taking the
role of auntie very seriously.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.170
She's a super fun kid.

09:08.256 --> 09:10.088
She's at that age
where her brain is...

09:10.175 --> 09:13.088
it's forming connections
that can't be rewritten.

09:13.178 --> 09:15.921
So, you're trying to program her
in your own image?

09:17.140 --> 09:19.348
No. I'm not...
I'm try...

09:19.434 --> 09:21.847
Okay, let's just crack
Sho's computer.

09:21.936 --> 09:24.269
Yes! Okay. Well, if he
really wanted to cooperate

09:24.355 --> 09:26.221
and help us stop
a terror attack,

09:26.316 --> 09:27.835
you'd think he would
give us the password.

09:27.859 --> 09:29.691
Well, he says
he doesn't remember.

09:29.778 --> 09:30.778
And you believe him?

09:30.862 --> 09:32.398
I don't believe anyone

09:32.489 --> 09:34.230
who has been on the FBI's
most wanted list.

09:34.324 --> 09:36.361
Oh, well, as a top ten alum,

09:36.451 --> 09:38.158
I will try not to
take that personally.

09:38.244 --> 09:41.988
All right, Sho used
a random password generator.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.664
It changes daily,
and he lost

09:43.750 --> 09:45.912
the device that
gave him the passwords

09:46.002 --> 09:47.743
when he went to jail
six months ago.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.248
If we had some of
the old passwords,

09:49.339 --> 09:50.921
we could use those
as a starting point.

09:51.007 --> 09:53.215
And then run the random
password algorithm

09:53.301 --> 09:54.667
until we generated
the new one.

09:54.761 --> 09:57.549
You say that like I haven't
thought of it already.

09:57.639 --> 09:59.972
- Oh.
- Sho gave me the ones he remembered.

10:00.058 --> 10:03.096
So, if we can
plug these in,

10:03.186 --> 10:05.269
the system will crack
Sho's laptop

10:05.355 --> 10:06.846
in 20 minutes.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.056
Okay, well,
in the meantime,

10:08.149 --> 10:09.435
why don't we come up
with a name

10:09.526 --> 10:11.313
for this Bethany app
you're developing?

10:11.402 --> 10:12.768
- Uh...
- Baby's...

10:12.862 --> 10:14.148
"Baby's First Mind Game."

10:14.239 --> 10:15.549
No, that sounds
like something else.

10:15.573 --> 10:18.691
"Inside the Baby's Brain"...
Bra... Bri...

10:18.785 --> 10:21.368
- What are you guys doing?
- Br... Briana.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.696
Are you giving me
a hilarious nickname?

10:23.790 --> 10:25.031
Excuse me? Around here,

10:25.125 --> 10:27.037
you have to earn
a hilarious nickname.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.618
Just ask Gravy Boat
over here.

10:30.505 --> 10:31.857
Let's start at the beginning.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.041
When and where
did Dabbur Zann

10:33.091 --> 10:34.902
first approach you about
the anti-tank weapons?

10:34.926 --> 10:36.588
- Am I going to Montana?
- Excuse me?

10:36.678 --> 10:38.169
When you put me in
witness protection.

10:38.263 --> 10:39.925
Because the Dabbur Zann
has tiny hotbeds

10:40.014 --> 10:41.801
throughout that state.
I'd prefer to go...

10:41.891 --> 10:43.974
Let's just try
and stay focused.

10:44.686 --> 10:47.019
I'm also concerned with the
southwest coast of Louisiana,

10:47.105 --> 10:49.188
and anywhere north
of the Mason-Dixon Line.

10:49.274 --> 10:50.626
You do realize that
you're gonna go straight back

10:50.650 --> 10:52.330
to prison if you
don't answer my questions.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.862
All right.
What was the question?

10:58.700 --> 11:00.566
When did you first
meet the Dabbur Zann?

11:00.660 --> 11:01.660
September of last year.

11:01.744 --> 11:03.576
September when?
Early? Mid?

11:03.663 --> 11:05.029
No, it was October,

11:05.123 --> 11:06.642
because I remember seeing
pumpkins on the doorsteps

11:06.666 --> 11:08.703
in Manhattan, so I guess
it could have been

11:08.793 --> 11:10.159
early November, actually.

11:10.253 --> 11:11.585
So, it was last fall...

11:11.671 --> 11:13.128
the first time
you met these guys.

11:13.214 --> 11:14.421
That wasn't the first time.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.123
First time was in Philadelphia.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.052
I'm sorry.

11:20.138 --> 11:22.471
It's hard to keep
my thoughts straight

11:22.557 --> 11:24.423
when every word I speak

11:24.517 --> 11:26.224
tightens the noose
around my own neck.

11:26.311 --> 11:27.472
How's that deal coming?

11:27.562 --> 11:29.679
Gets a whole lot better
the more you tell me.

11:30.857 --> 11:32.894
Let's focus
and start talking.

11:32.984 --> 11:36.068
With this new identity,
do I get a plus one?

11:36.154 --> 11:37.486
<i>'Cause I'd love
to disappear...</i>

11:37.572 --> 11:39.234
- Something wrong?
- No.

11:39.324 --> 11:40.781
<i>No, scratch that.</i>

11:40.867 --> 11:43.280
<i>My other girlfriend,
Jess.</i>

11:43.369 --> 11:45.827
Reade has a coffee date with
an old college friend tomorrow.

11:45.914 --> 11:47.371
Lexi.

11:47.457 --> 11:50.495
Ah. And you're not sure
how you feel about it.

11:50.585 --> 11:52.229
What does it matter what I feel?
We're just friends.

11:52.253 --> 11:54.495
Well, I don't know.
Are you?

11:54.589 --> 11:55.830
This is stupid.

11:55.924 --> 11:57.790
I don't even know why
I'm talking about it.

11:57.884 --> 12:01.252
Look, with everything
that happened with Kurt,

12:01.346 --> 12:03.429
the hardest part for me

12:03.514 --> 12:05.881
was trying to deny
how I felt.

12:05.975 --> 12:08.888
It was impossible
to be around each other

12:08.978 --> 12:10.310
without acknowledging it.

12:10.396 --> 12:12.228
Okay, it's just,
I hate this.

12:12.315 --> 12:14.272
The work and
the personal together?

12:14.359 --> 12:16.442
It gets messy.

12:16.527 --> 12:18.234
No offense.

12:18.321 --> 12:19.653
None taken.

12:21.324 --> 12:23.031
This guy's a nervous wreck.

12:23.117 --> 12:24.470
He can't keep
his thoughts straight.

12:24.494 --> 12:27.032
Doesn't feel good
being a rat.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.537
Let's hope there's
something on that laptop.

12:31.876 --> 12:34.459
Hey, we got an "L"!
Thank you, Vanna.

12:34.545 --> 12:36.662
Now, back to watching
paint dry.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.833
Is there anything
I can do?

12:40.927 --> 12:43.044
- Coffee?
- No, we're good.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.429
You don't need me here,
do you?

12:46.516 --> 12:47.677
Course we do!

12:47.767 --> 12:49.099
Once we crack this laptop,

12:49.185 --> 12:50.847
the race is on
to find something useful.

12:50.937 --> 12:52.790
Hey, why don't we get
to know each other better?

12:52.814 --> 12:54.680
How 'bout, uh,
some 20 Questions?

12:54.774 --> 12:56.436
How about
zero questions?

12:56.526 --> 12:58.142
Okay, first question.

12:58.236 --> 12:59.977
It's Friday night.
Are you going out,

13:00.071 --> 13:02.063
or you staying in to make dinner?
Briana.

13:02.156 --> 13:03.676
- Going out, for sure.
- Right?

13:03.700 --> 13:04.941
Yeah.

13:05.034 --> 13:06.775
- What about you, Patty Cakes?
- Pass.

13:06.869 --> 13:08.610
Come on, don't be
a Passy Cakes.

13:09.747 --> 13:12.205
Home is where the Hulu is.

13:12.292 --> 13:15.285
Yeah! It is a phenomenal
streaming service.

13:15.378 --> 13:17.791
Okay, speaking of home...

13:18.464 --> 13:19.733
what kind of people
are your neighbors?

13:19.757 --> 13:21.437
Do you like 'em?
These are weird questions.

13:21.509 --> 13:23.195
Damn it,
Perkins!

13:23.219 --> 13:25.211
I told him to warn me

13:25.305 --> 13:26.716
when the reboot
was gonna happen.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.469
He said it should only take
about ten minutes, right?

13:29.559 --> 13:32.142
Okay, the next question.
This is a fun one.

13:32.228 --> 13:35.938
Do either of you have
any chronic health problems?

13:37.650 --> 13:38.936
What is the matter
with you?

13:49.120 --> 13:50.156
Whoa!

13:50.246 --> 13:51.953
What the hell?
You scared me, man.

13:53.916 --> 13:55.578
It's fine.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.375
So, sector eight
just rebooted,

13:57.462 --> 13:59.829
which should cover
the second level sub-basement.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.458
Shoot.

14:01.549 --> 14:03.757
I forgot to tell Patterson
about her lab.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.051
Do me a favor
and wire this

14:06.137 --> 14:08.003
through terminals
four through nine.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.512
It's been ten minutes.

14:54.602 --> 14:56.810
The system should be
booting back up any second.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.138
Okay, question
number 28.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.519
Out of 20?
What the hell, man?

15:01.609 --> 15:03.817
If a financial emergency
were to arise,

15:03.903 --> 15:06.896
do you feel confident that you
would be able to take care of it?

15:06.989 --> 15:10.198
Sure. Boston and I
are working

15:10.284 --> 15:12.651
on a sequel
to Wizardville right now.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.515
You're not being serious.
That's not actually happening.

15:14.539 --> 15:15.825
I mean,
I couldn't even afford

15:15.915 --> 15:17.747
a surprise parking
ticket right now.

15:17.834 --> 15:20.292
Guess it's a good thing
I can't afford a car.

15:20.378 --> 15:21.960
I haven't had a raise in years.

15:22.046 --> 15:24.129
Okay, that kinda brought
the room down, there.

15:24.215 --> 15:25.331
Next question:

15:25.425 --> 15:28.964
- What do you feel about the schools in your area?
- Hey!

15:29.053 --> 15:30.919
- Talk to you for a second?
- Yeah.

15:31.639 --> 15:32.675
What?

15:32.765 --> 15:34.472
I know what you're doing.

15:34.559 --> 15:35.661
Trying to get to know
Briana a little better?

15:35.685 --> 15:36.725
Make her part of the team?

15:36.811 --> 15:38.768
These are questions

15:38.855 --> 15:41.723
on the adoption
home study questionnaire.

15:41.816 --> 15:43.648
How did you know
I was looking into that?

15:43.734 --> 15:48.274
I... accidentally...
looked at your browser history

15:48.364 --> 15:50.300
- a bunch of times. I do it a lot.
- That is none of your business.

15:50.324 --> 15:51.760
I'm just surprised.
I didn't know you wanted kids.

15:51.784 --> 15:52.945
I... don't.

15:53.035 --> 15:54.596
Well, then you should probably
avoid adopting one.

15:54.620 --> 15:55.806
I... I don't know
what I want, okay?

15:55.830 --> 15:56.946
I was just looking.

15:57.039 --> 15:58.599
I... I've been spending
time with my dad

15:58.624 --> 15:59.865
and playing with Bethany,

15:59.959 --> 16:01.951
and that just
made me think that...

16:02.044 --> 16:04.127
maybe I should...
think about it.

16:04.213 --> 16:05.795
Someday. In the future.

16:05.882 --> 16:07.794
In the far,
far distant future.

16:07.884 --> 16:10.376
Okay. I'm excited.
Let's go for it.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.780
- Let's adopt a kid. I'm down.
- No, I...

16:11.804 --> 16:13.511
- Oh, my God. Drop it, okay?
- What?

16:14.849 --> 16:16.636
Where are we
on Sho's laptop?

16:16.726 --> 16:18.934
Uh, without my system,
nowhere.

16:19.020 --> 16:20.761
Maybe there's a problem
with the reboot.

16:20.855 --> 16:22.207
I'm gonna go down
to the server room

16:22.231 --> 16:23.542
and give Perkins a piece
of my mind.

16:23.566 --> 16:25.127
I'll go with you...
you'll need a supervisor

16:25.151 --> 16:26.795
to access the rooms with
the new hand scanners.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.173
In the meantime, can you get on
this computer without a computer?

16:29.197 --> 16:31.655
Every second we waste here,
Dabbur Zann is planning an attack.

16:31.741 --> 16:34.233
Oh, yeah, crack a...
a computer password

16:34.327 --> 16:36.410
without a computer system?
Sure, no problem.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.579
- Good. All right, let's go.
- Okay.

16:38.664 --> 16:42.374
Okay, so we know
the base equation

16:42.460 --> 16:44.747
and enough of the variables,
don't we?

16:44.837 --> 16:48.672
Isn't it just a matter
of plugging in the values

16:48.758 --> 16:50.545
and solving
for the remainders?

16:50.635 --> 16:53.503
I mean,
I'm not saying it wouldn't take a long time,

16:53.596 --> 16:55.428
but theoretically,
that could work, right?

16:58.142 --> 17:00.259
Did I... say
something wrong?

17:00.353 --> 17:02.936
No. It's just...

17:03.022 --> 17:05.765
Patterson usually comes up
with the math stuff.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.065
All right,
I've been plugged in

17:07.151 --> 17:08.608
for a little bit too long.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.464
You know what? Let's,
uh, sharpen those pencils

17:10.488 --> 17:12.695
and roll up our sleeves.

17:19.747 --> 17:21.954
Ready for another
round with Sho?

17:22.040 --> 17:25.125
The more this guy talks,
the less he seems to say.

17:25.211 --> 17:27.453
So, he's either too
nervous to roll over

17:27.547 --> 17:30.836
on these guys anymore,
or... he's out of intel.

17:30.925 --> 17:32.791
We're gonna crack him.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.844
You will be having pancakes
with Bethany in no time.

17:38.140 --> 17:41.804
I hate that one breakfast
matters so much.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.635
I want to be around.

17:44.105 --> 17:46.438
I don't wanna be like my mom.

17:46.524 --> 17:48.231
I want Bethany to know
how much I love her,

17:48.317 --> 17:49.774
and I'll always
be there for her.

17:49.860 --> 17:51.852
Hey, she does.

17:51.946 --> 17:54.359
You spend time with her
every chance you get.

17:54.448 --> 17:56.565
And you make
every minute count.

17:56.659 --> 18:00.448
Yesterday, I watched you read,
like, ten books to her.

18:00.538 --> 18:02.530
And then you taught her
the Johnny Cash song.

18:02.623 --> 18:04.434
And you made her the Easter
Bunny out of Play-Doh.

18:04.458 --> 18:06.165
And that was just
during bedtime.

18:06.252 --> 18:07.834
That bunny was pretty good,
wasn't it?

18:07.920 --> 18:09.627
- It was.
- Mm.

18:09.714 --> 18:10.830
And Kurt,
down the road,

18:10.923 --> 18:12.755
there's gonna be
so many more bunnies.

18:12.842 --> 18:15.505
We're gonna take
time off, vacation,

18:15.595 --> 18:17.131
move back to Colorado
eventually

18:17.221 --> 18:19.258
and watch her grow up.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.214
But right now...

18:22.059 --> 18:23.495
Right now, we're working
to make sure

18:23.519 --> 18:26.227
that Bethany has a world
to grow up in.

18:26.314 --> 18:28.431
So everything
that you're doing right...

18:28.524 --> 18:30.265
What is it?

18:31.277 --> 18:34.020
Sho likes control,
doesn't he?

18:34.572 --> 18:36.188
This might be
the first time in his life

18:36.282 --> 18:38.615
that he feels like
he doesn't have it.

18:38.701 --> 18:40.363
Maybe if he gets
some of it back,

18:40.453 --> 18:41.864
he might get it
together enough

18:41.954 --> 18:43.991
that he gives us
something useful.

18:44.081 --> 18:46.414
What do you have in mind?

18:46.500 --> 18:48.412
Okay, Sho.

18:48.502 --> 18:52.086
So, what do you want
from witness protection?

18:52.173 --> 18:53.960
Whatever you need,
just write us a list.

18:54.050 --> 18:56.007
- Really?
- Yes.

18:56.093 --> 18:58.085
But you do have
to give us something

18:58.179 --> 18:59.886
that we can use
to stop this attack.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.133
Think of this as,
you know,

19:01.223 --> 19:02.555
a starting point
for negotiations.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.474
And while
you're writing...

19:04.560 --> 19:06.121
you can tell us where
you arranged the deal

19:06.145 --> 19:07.431
with the Dabbur Zann.

19:07.521 --> 19:09.433
It was in Manhattan, right?

19:09.523 --> 19:10.604
Yeah.

19:10.691 --> 19:11.977
The Dairman Hotel.

19:12.068 --> 19:14.151
- Have you been?
- No.

19:14.236 --> 19:16.728
It's a little rich
for our blood.

19:16.822 --> 19:19.530
Do you think
six armed guards

19:19.617 --> 19:21.574
at all times, 24/7,
is excessive?

19:21.661 --> 19:24.074
Well, let's just say
this is a conversation starter.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.779
That's my thinking.
Make it a dozen. Hmm.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.614
So, why'd you meet
at the Dairman Hotel?

19:27.708 --> 19:29.165
Was it in view of a target,

19:29.251 --> 19:31.538
or close proximity
to a safe house?

19:31.629 --> 19:33.746
Nah. It's all about
the service.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.250
What kind of service?

19:36.926 --> 19:39.339
I called the restaurant
there one night,

19:39.428 --> 19:41.920
and requested whale.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.301
You know what they said?

19:44.392 --> 19:46.099
"Which species?"

19:47.061 --> 19:48.518
- That's something.
- Yeah.

19:50.064 --> 19:51.521
Okay, so, Sho,

19:51.607 --> 19:54.566
you and these Dabbur Zann
soldiers are all

19:54.652 --> 19:56.129
just hanging out
at the Dairman Hotel,

19:56.153 --> 19:58.861
doin' deals,
eating whales.

19:58.948 --> 19:59.984
How many were there?

20:00.074 --> 20:01.218
How many whales?
Just the one.

20:01.242 --> 20:02.323
How many Dabbur Zann?

20:02.410 --> 20:04.276
Seven.
Got a little crowded,

20:04.370 --> 20:05.736
even for
the presidential suite.

20:05.830 --> 20:07.617
So, the hotel is
where they asked you

20:07.707 --> 20:09.539
to get the weapons
for the attack.

20:09.625 --> 20:10.866
Yeah.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.828
You know, we stayed in,
partied,

20:13.921 --> 20:15.913
got lit during
the pay-per-view fight.

20:16.006 --> 20:17.918
Fight?
Which fight?

20:18.008 --> 20:21.092
Willis versus Gomez.
Epic.

20:21.178 --> 20:22.714
You got to
watch that live?

20:22.805 --> 20:23.886
You saw the knockout?

20:23.973 --> 20:25.384
90-inch screen in 8K.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.411
I don't watch anything
anymore unless it's in 8K now.

20:27.435 --> 20:28.435
Hurts my eyes.

20:28.519 --> 20:30.055
I'm gonna put that
on my list.

20:30.146 --> 20:31.998
I tried to find a clip
of that online the next day.

20:32.022 --> 20:33.125
Couldn't find it anywhere,
though.

20:33.149 --> 20:34.310
You know, copyright laws.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.392
Too bad.
You missed a good one.

20:36.485 --> 20:38.693
Willis went low
on Gomez three times,

20:38.779 --> 20:40.645
but Gomez pulled it out.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.092
If you're a fan,
you should watch live.

20:42.116 --> 20:43.357
I tried to.

20:43.451 --> 20:46.785
The live broadcast,
eh, it glitched.

20:46.871 --> 20:49.204
It cut out. Everywhere.

20:49.290 --> 20:50.826
People were pissed.

20:50.916 --> 20:52.077
The only place

20:52.168 --> 20:53.955
that you could have
seen it live

20:54.044 --> 20:56.707
and known all
of those details,

20:57.298 --> 20:59.836
is if you saw it in person...

20:59.925 --> 21:01.962
in Las Vegas.

21:03.304 --> 21:04.761
Why lie about that?

21:04.847 --> 21:06.679
You know, maybe
the saying should be,

21:06.766 --> 21:09.133
"Whatever happens
in Vegas stays in Vegas,

21:09.226 --> 21:11.343
unless you've got
a big mouth."

21:17.193 --> 21:18.193
Done.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.563
I think this is it.

21:19.653 --> 21:21.144
All right, let me try.

21:25.201 --> 21:26.988
It's no good.

21:27.077 --> 21:28.443
Let's see...

21:31.290 --> 21:34.749
All right.
Okay, try the same password

21:34.835 --> 21:37.543
but change the last letter
to "N."

21:39.965 --> 21:42.173
Okay, we're in.

21:42.259 --> 21:44.421
What do we look for?
There's so much to sift through.

21:45.095 --> 21:48.133
Hey. Sho was in Las Vegas
October 23rd.

21:48.224 --> 21:49.951
- Which he didn't want us to know.
- What?

21:49.975 --> 21:51.762
We said that
we would only help him

21:51.852 --> 21:53.246
if he was 100 percent
transparent with us.

21:53.270 --> 21:54.602
Well, I can tell you
right now,

21:54.688 --> 21:55.916
he's 100 percent
hiding something.

21:55.940 --> 21:57.932
Okay, there were two files

21:58.025 --> 22:00.017
that were downloaded
around that date.

22:00.110 --> 22:02.397
First file looks like stolen

22:02.488 --> 22:05.151
security protocols
for Nellis Air Force Base,

22:05.241 --> 22:06.760
- which is in Vegas.
- Okay, the other

22:06.784 --> 22:08.650
is a bunch of digits
he typed into the notepad.

22:08.744 --> 22:10.076
A serial number, maybe?

22:10.162 --> 22:12.199
No, that's an FBI
file number,

22:12.289 --> 22:14.281
just an older designation.

22:14.375 --> 22:16.520
Trust me, I spent a lot of time
dealing with paperwork.

22:16.544 --> 22:20.163
Okay, if Rich and Reade
can get the system back up,

22:20.256 --> 22:21.292
it'll take us
two seconds

22:21.382 --> 22:23.044
to access whatever
file this is.

22:23.133 --> 22:24.653
Okay, but we're running
out of time for "ifs."

22:24.677 --> 22:27.340
If it's old enough, we might have
a hard copy in the archives.

22:27.429 --> 22:29.591
I can at least find
which boxes to sift through.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.389
Good.
Lead the way.

22:32.726 --> 22:34.037
How much farther
is the server room?

22:34.061 --> 22:35.580
Hey, it's not my fault
the elevators are out.

22:35.604 --> 22:37.061
Blame Perkins.

22:37.147 --> 22:38.708
Hey, so this Lexi date,
you guys are going for coffee?

22:38.732 --> 22:40.143
It's not a date, Rich.

22:40.234 --> 22:42.003
Oh, are you and what's-her-name
still a thing, or...

22:42.027 --> 22:43.313
Zapata and I are not an item.

22:43.404 --> 22:44.548
Well, then why can't it
be a date, you know?

22:44.572 --> 22:46.234
Enjoy yourself.
Enjoy other people.

22:46.323 --> 22:47.425
Heck, spread your wings,
at least until you

22:47.449 --> 22:48.635
and Patterson
finally get together.

22:48.659 --> 22:49.900
Wait, what?

22:49.994 --> 22:51.656
I'm just putting it out
into the universe.

22:51.745 --> 22:53.987
- Something's wrong with you.
- Yeah.

22:54.081 --> 22:56.118
Yeah.

22:57.668 --> 22:59.204
All right,
find Perkins and fix this.

22:59.295 --> 23:00.411
Okay.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.497
You know,
a "please" wouldn't kill ya.

23:04.425 --> 23:05.506
Perkins?

23:05.593 --> 23:07.084
Hello?

23:07.636 --> 23:09.298
Hello?

23:09.388 --> 23:11.801
Where are you,
my finely-coiffed friend?

23:14.184 --> 23:15.720
Perkins?

23:20.858 --> 23:22.224
Oh, boy.

23:22.318 --> 23:23.604
Reade?

23:23.694 --> 23:25.060
Reade?!

23:29.992 --> 23:33.110
Perkins is dead!
Reade!

23:46.050 --> 23:49.919
This box has files
from the '80s, '90s,

23:50.012 --> 23:51.969
a file from 2004.

23:52.056 --> 23:54.514
And it's dated 2011.

23:54.600 --> 23:55.761
Yeah, well, this one's

23:55.851 --> 23:57.968
stuffed with
old office supplies.

23:58.062 --> 24:00.770
Finding the file number from
Sho's computer could take years.

24:00.856 --> 24:02.392
Sho claimed
that the Dabbur Zann

24:02.483 --> 24:04.065
was gonna attack
at any moment.

24:04.151 --> 24:06.643
So, assuming that's still true,
we don't have a lot of time.

24:06.737 --> 24:08.399
Who filed these?
Gremlins?

24:08.489 --> 24:09.980
Found it! Uh...

24:10.074 --> 24:13.238
File 219-3206.

24:13.327 --> 24:18.573
It is an arrest record
for a Pavel Makarov.

24:18.666 --> 24:19.998
A Bulgarian citizen.

24:20.084 --> 24:22.701
History is arm trafficking
and...

24:22.795 --> 24:25.412
joined the Dabbur Zann
in 2009.

24:25.506 --> 24:26.946
Sho must
have stolen his file

24:27.007 --> 24:28.794
to research
his new client.

24:28.884 --> 24:31.752
I saw this guy.
Today, here in the building.

24:32.596 --> 24:33.803
Hey. Hey-hey-hey!

24:33.889 --> 24:35.425
- You sure?
- Yes.

24:35.516 --> 24:36.993
I called him out because
he was carrying

24:37.017 --> 24:38.679
the wrong cables
for our network.

24:38.769 --> 24:40.889
And... it's because he's not
a real Blue Annex worker.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.666
He infiltrated their team.
Wait, do you think

24:42.690 --> 24:44.431
that he's Dabbur Zann,
here to kill Sho?

24:44.525 --> 24:45.525
Or to break him out.

24:45.609 --> 24:48.226
You know, maybe Sho never really
turned on the Dabbur Zann.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.811
What if his story
about getting them

24:49.905 --> 24:51.646
anti-tank weapons
was just a ploy

24:51.740 --> 24:53.322
to get us to move him here?

24:53.409 --> 24:55.776
Reade and Rich should be
at the server room by now.

24:57.329 --> 24:58.615
My phone is down.

24:58.706 --> 25:00.868
Mine too.
And mine.

25:00.958 --> 25:02.699
Whoever's doing this
must be using a jammer.

25:02.793 --> 25:04.659
We have to get down there.
Okay, you,

25:04.753 --> 25:06.356
stay here in case
the server comes back up.

25:06.380 --> 25:07.857
Patterson and I will go
find Reade and Rich.

25:07.881 --> 25:10.168
- Jane, we'll go get Sho.
- Okay.

25:12.219 --> 25:13.710
What took you
so long?

25:13.804 --> 25:15.670
I was almost
running out of lies.

25:17.099 --> 25:18.431
Ah, sweet relie...

25:18.517 --> 25:21.009
Hey, what the hell?!

25:21.103 --> 25:22.765
No, no, no.
That wasn't the deal.

25:22.855 --> 25:24.708
I'm not telling you anything
until you get me out of here.

25:24.732 --> 25:26.018
The second
we hit the street,

25:26.108 --> 25:27.268
we can finish
our transaction,

25:27.317 --> 25:28.728
go our separate ways.

25:35.743 --> 25:38.736
So... how are we
getting out?

25:40.664 --> 25:42.280
Perfect.

25:48.839 --> 25:50.501
All right, gonna
override the lock.

25:56.346 --> 25:57.928
Hey, hey, hey!
It's us.

25:58.015 --> 25:59.381
Where's Reade?

25:59.475 --> 26:01.057
I don't know.
I figured you would know.

26:01.143 --> 26:02.495
Someone locked me
in the server room.

26:02.519 --> 26:03.872
All right, we need
to talk to Perkins.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.206
We gotta get
this system rebooted.

26:05.230 --> 26:06.391
- Where is he?
- Well, he's on

26:06.482 --> 26:08.724
a bit of a break...
permanently.

26:11.445 --> 26:12.686
Oh, man.

26:12.780 --> 26:14.612
We gotta go find Reade.
Wait-wait-wait.

26:14.698 --> 26:16.801
There's barely anyone here
tonight because of the update.

26:16.825 --> 26:18.178
Fastest way to find Reade
is if we get

26:18.202 --> 26:19.409
these cameras
up and running.

26:19.495 --> 26:21.612
Yes, that's what
I was thinking.

26:21.705 --> 26:23.162
Okay, I have
the upgrade codes,

26:23.248 --> 26:25.240
so that's a good
place to start.

26:26.335 --> 26:27.917
Okay.

26:28.003 --> 26:30.336
Uh... okay.

26:30.422 --> 26:32.459
Great. The update is complete.

26:32.549 --> 26:34.381
- Let's reboot everything. Rich?
- Oh, okay.

26:36.136 --> 26:37.923
Okay, uh... mainframe.

26:38.013 --> 26:41.347
Remote access.
Comms. And security.

26:43.811 --> 26:45.268
I told you to wait in the lab.

26:45.354 --> 26:46.936
There is a killer
in the building.

26:47.022 --> 26:48.729
Which is why
I didn't feel safe.

26:48.816 --> 26:50.682
This is not how you get
a nickname, Briana.

26:50.776 --> 26:52.938
All right, we're back.

26:54.488 --> 26:57.822
Whoa. That update
really sped things up.

26:57.908 --> 27:00.525
I kind of feel like a jerk
for being so mean to him now.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.514
Hey, you know what? It's because I'm
spending too much time with you.

27:02.538 --> 27:05.281
- That's what it is.
- Don't put this on me. The man is in the room!

27:05.374 --> 27:07.018
All right, we can
work around the jammer now.

27:07.042 --> 27:08.783
Patterson.

27:08.877 --> 27:11.244
<i>Perkins is dead
and Reade is missing.</i>

27:11.338 --> 27:12.816
Pavel's already got to Sho.
They're on the move.

27:12.840 --> 27:14.251
<i>Uh, I'm scrubbing through</i>

27:14.341 --> 27:16.082
the live feeds now.

27:18.971 --> 27:21.008
Hey! Got 'em.
All right, they're headed

27:21.098 --> 27:23.181
to the east lobby exit.

27:23.267 --> 27:27.807
They have Reade with them.
He looks... unconscious.

27:27.896 --> 27:29.432
Can you lock
the building down?

27:29.523 --> 27:31.626
<i>Not quick enough. The system is
still coming back online.</i>

27:31.650 --> 27:34.108
Well, then, we just
have to catch up to them.

27:39.616 --> 27:41.052
East lobby security desk.

27:41.076 --> 27:42.408
<i>This is special agent Patterson.</i>

27:42.494 --> 27:44.326
Prepare to engage
with two dangerous persons

27:44.413 --> 27:45.824
holding an agent hostage

27:45.914 --> 27:47.450
<i>- headed your way.</i>
- What?

27:47.541 --> 27:49.908
Hey, Sprouse,
we got a problem.

27:51.503 --> 27:52.664
Hey!

27:55.090 --> 27:58.003
So badass.

27:58.093 --> 27:59.373
Hey, you remind me
of a young me,

27:59.428 --> 28:01.511
except bigger
and thicker and whiter.

28:01.597 --> 28:02.929
FBI! Show me your hands!

28:03.891 --> 28:05.678
Show me your hands!

28:07.644 --> 28:08.976
Drop that lighter.

28:09.062 --> 28:10.331
You really don't
want him to do that.

28:10.355 --> 28:12.972
Your friend is soaked in highly
flammable cleaning solvent,

28:13.066 --> 28:14.807
so "don't move"...
back atcha.

28:14.902 --> 28:16.438
That's not how
this works, Sho.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.168
Your friend's about to be
a human bonfire.

28:18.197 --> 28:19.984
We say how this works.

28:20.073 --> 28:22.907
Stop! You two are better at
playing scared than I am,

28:22.993 --> 28:25.827
but I guess I was good enough.

28:25.913 --> 28:28.075
Sho... you don't
need to do this.

28:28.165 --> 28:30.031
Oh, no? You wanna
make a deal?

28:30.125 --> 28:32.145
Why don't you write me a list
of the things you want?

28:32.169 --> 28:34.206
- Sound cool?
- As soon as you walk out of here,

28:34.296 --> 28:36.538
the entire FBI is gonna
hunt both of you down.

28:36.632 --> 28:39.090
I guess we need
a head start.

28:40.510 --> 28:41.876
No!

28:48.060 --> 28:49.596
No!

29:05.953 --> 29:08.320
Oh, God, I hate being wet.

29:12.584 --> 29:13.665
They're gone.

29:21.468 --> 29:24.211
NYPD's joining our manhunt
for Sho and Pavel.

29:24.304 --> 29:26.091
I'll send them
our search patterns now.

29:26.181 --> 29:27.325
- Update our teams on the ground.
- Yeah.

29:27.349 --> 29:28.493
We should get you
to the hospital.

29:28.517 --> 29:30.008
I'll see a medic.
I'll be fine.

29:30.102 --> 29:31.102
You don't look fine.

29:31.103 --> 29:32.344
I'll feel a lot worse

29:32.437 --> 29:33.723
if Sho Ahktar
and the Dabbur Zann

29:33.814 --> 29:35.021
execute a terrorist attack.

29:35.107 --> 29:36.334
Now, are we sure his story
was a red herring?

29:36.358 --> 29:39.021
We finally heard back
from every defense contractor

29:39.111 --> 29:41.273
that manufactures
anti-tank weapons.

29:41.363 --> 29:43.400
All missiles
are accounted for.

29:43.490 --> 29:45.106
But you don't just
break a convict

29:45.200 --> 29:46.691
out of an FBI office for nothing.

29:46.785 --> 29:49.072
According to Pavel's file,
he already has a lot of money.

29:49.162 --> 29:50.528
So Sho's giving him
something else.

29:50.622 --> 29:51.766
Okay, what do we know
about Pavel?

29:51.790 --> 29:54.123
Not much.
He carried out attacks

29:54.209 --> 29:56.292
in Syria, Yemen, Kosovo...

29:56.378 --> 29:58.165
Ooh, what is that?

29:58.255 --> 29:59.666
It's a new kind
of intel alert.

29:59.756 --> 30:01.839
The updated system
streamlines

30:01.925 --> 30:04.292
information sharing
across agencies.

30:04.386 --> 30:07.220
I gotta give it to Perkins.
It's... it's pretty cool.

30:07.306 --> 30:11.141
So, according to the DOD,
Pavel Makarov was thought

30:11.226 --> 30:13.388
to be killed in an air strike
two years ago

30:13.478 --> 30:14.810
along with his wife
and daughter.

30:14.896 --> 30:16.762
So this is about revenge.

30:18.358 --> 30:19.849
We know Sho was in Vegas

30:19.943 --> 30:22.356
to steal security protocols
from Nellis Air Force Base.

30:22.446 --> 30:26.611
What if Pavel hired him
to find the person or people

30:26.700 --> 30:28.566
responsible for killing
his family?

30:28.660 --> 30:29.992
That's not a bad theory.

30:30.078 --> 30:31.569
See, that's how
you earn a nickname.

30:31.663 --> 30:33.141
Who gave the order
for the air strike?

30:33.165 --> 30:36.033
Uh, Colonel Sheryl Meeks.

30:36.126 --> 30:37.562
She's now retired,
living in an estate

30:37.586 --> 30:38.952
just outside
of New York City.

30:39.046 --> 30:41.459
So Pavel hired Sho
to find the identity

30:41.548 --> 30:43.835
and the location
of the colonel.

30:43.925 --> 30:47.168
Sho steals the information
from the Air Force base,

30:47.262 --> 30:49.800
but gets arrested before
he can get it to Pavel.

30:49.890 --> 30:51.381
So this is
an information exchange.

30:51.475 --> 30:53.011
Pavel came to collect.

30:53.101 --> 30:54.141
He's gonna go after Meeks.

30:54.227 --> 30:55.684
I'll send local PD
to the estate.

30:55.771 --> 30:57.040
Weller, Jane, Zapata,
head over there.

30:57.064 --> 30:58.958
Take a team and make sure
she gets to a safe house.

30:58.982 --> 31:00.348
Let's move.

31:07.616 --> 31:10.074
Officers,
identify yourselves.

31:10.160 --> 31:11.304
<i>Stone and Myers.</i>

31:11.328 --> 31:14.116
<i>Other unit is on the way.
They'll be here soon.</i>

31:14.206 --> 31:16.448
- Code word?
<i>- Seabreeze.</i>

31:16.541 --> 31:17.702
You're clear.

31:17.793 --> 31:19.455
Any sign of him?

31:19.544 --> 31:21.627
Uh, no. Not yet.

31:21.713 --> 31:24.547
We have your property
surrounded with FBI teams.

31:24.633 --> 31:27.376
We even have a police unit.
Another one on the way.

31:27.469 --> 31:28.960
So we might not
have to leave.

31:29.054 --> 31:31.671
We'd prefer it if you did,
the sooner the better.

31:31.765 --> 31:32.972
I'm almost done.

31:33.058 --> 31:34.094
Sorry, ma'am.

31:36.478 --> 31:37.639
What's that noise?

31:37.729 --> 31:39.766
Oh, that's
the dinosaur hunter.

31:39.856 --> 31:41.097
The what?

31:42.025 --> 31:43.641
Oh, hey.

31:43.735 --> 31:45.146
Mom, can I bring
my truck?

31:45.237 --> 31:47.069
Yes, you can.

31:47.155 --> 31:49.008
But listen, you have to finish
packing first, okay?

31:49.032 --> 31:50.694
Where's your father?

31:50.784 --> 31:53.367
Emmett, you can't
run off like that.

31:53.453 --> 31:54.739
It's okay, sir.

31:57.749 --> 31:59.115
This is for you.

31:59.209 --> 32:00.370
Wow.

32:00.460 --> 32:01.701
Thanks, little man.

32:01.795 --> 32:03.081
Come on.

32:03.171 --> 32:04.252
Let's go.

32:06.049 --> 32:08.462
I can't believe
this is happening.

32:08.552 --> 32:10.293
I retired eight months ago

32:10.387 --> 32:13.676
so that I could finally relax
and spend time with my family.

32:13.765 --> 32:15.427
This'll be over soon,
ma'am.

32:15.517 --> 32:16.911
Yeah, that's what
I kept telling myself

32:16.935 --> 32:18.096
when I was in the Air Force.

32:18.186 --> 32:20.052
"This war will soon be over."

32:20.147 --> 32:22.139
And yet here we are still.

32:22.232 --> 32:24.975
I'm pretty sure this
is an isolated incident.

32:25.068 --> 32:26.730
I get briefed once a month

32:26.820 --> 32:29.312
on all the potential threats
on my life.

32:29.406 --> 32:32.023
This wasn't even
deemed a high priority.

32:33.034 --> 32:34.034
Yeah.

32:35.579 --> 32:37.070
Do you have kids?

32:37.164 --> 32:39.406
Yeah, I do.

32:39.499 --> 32:40.865
I've got a daughter.

32:40.959 --> 32:46.330
Well, from one bad guy hunter
to another,

32:46.423 --> 32:49.131
hug your daughter
every chance you get,

32:49.217 --> 32:51.834
because it never ends.

32:52.721 --> 32:54.508
And if and when it does,

32:54.598 --> 32:57.011
it might not be
how you want it to.

32:58.018 --> 32:59.099
Yes, ma'am.

33:08.695 --> 33:11.153
Officers,
identify yourselves.

33:13.617 --> 33:15.233
Officers?

33:15.327 --> 33:17.239
<i>Uh, Bronson and Garney.</i>

33:17.329 --> 33:20.037
Code word: Seabreeze.

33:20.123 --> 33:21.910
<i>Copy. You're clear.</i>

33:22.000 --> 33:23.957
Will you please...

33:25.545 --> 33:27.502
All packed.

33:27.589 --> 33:29.046
Okay...

33:29.132 --> 33:31.749
Well, I'll go find
your son and your husband.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.584
Then we'll
get out of here.

33:33.678 --> 33:34.919
What's going on?

33:35.013 --> 33:37.630
Officers,
any movement outside?

33:40.852 --> 33:43.595
Sheryl, just come here.

33:43.688 --> 33:44.849
Okay?

33:51.988 --> 33:53.024
Jane?

33:53.782 --> 33:56.240
Tasha?
What's your 20?

33:56.326 --> 33:58.693
South side
of the first floor.

34:02.707 --> 34:05.120
Agent down.
Pavel's in the house.

34:06.336 --> 34:07.622
Agent Hughes?

34:07.712 --> 34:09.668
Is the family secure?

34:09.755 --> 34:11.088
Agent Hughes?

34:11.174 --> 34:13.882
<i>Do you copy?
Agent Hughes, answer me.</i>

34:21.268 --> 34:22.804
Sheryl, come with me.

34:23.937 --> 34:25.473
We're gonna go
out that door.

34:26.898 --> 34:28.605
I've got eyes
on Emmett and Calvin.

34:34.822 --> 34:36.530
Where's Mom?

34:39.077 --> 34:41.114
Run! Emmett, go!

34:42.539 --> 34:43.641
<i>Emmett!</i>

34:43.665 --> 34:45.827
- Emmett, run!
- He got Dad!

34:45.917 --> 34:47.498
Go downstairs.

34:47.585 --> 34:48.918
Stay quiet.

34:49.795 --> 34:51.161
Jane, Tasha,

34:51.255 --> 34:52.792
Sheryl and the kid
are coming to you.

34:52.882 --> 34:53.998
I'm going after Pavel.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.583
Okay, Kurt, be careful.

35:01.516 --> 35:02.916
Emmett, listen,
where's your father?

35:43.683 --> 35:44.764
I got a shot.

35:44.851 --> 35:46.308
- Me too.
- Take it.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.935
Kurt, are you hit?

35:56.279 --> 35:59.067
I'm okay.
I'm not hit.

36:01.951 --> 36:04.113
Where's Emmett and Sheryl?

36:04.204 --> 36:06.821
They're fine.
It's over.

36:19.344 --> 36:21.927
We vetted the rest
of the Blue Annex workers.

36:22.013 --> 36:23.129
They checked out okay.

36:23.223 --> 36:24.464
And they'll be
finished soon.

36:24.557 --> 36:26.719
Pavel was only able
to infiltrate their team

36:26.810 --> 36:28.096
by impersonating a new hire

36:28.186 --> 36:29.746
that the rest of the team
had never met.

36:29.813 --> 36:31.725
The real Gavin Decker
was found murdered

36:31.815 --> 36:33.022
in his apartment.

36:33.108 --> 36:34.269
I'll put a protective detail

36:34.359 --> 36:35.725
on the Meeks family
for a while.

36:35.819 --> 36:38.562
Pavel went after them alone,
but with Sho still out there,

36:38.655 --> 36:39.691
can't be too sure.

36:39.781 --> 36:40.883
My guess is
he's long gone by now.

36:40.907 --> 36:42.114
Nah, he'll be back.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.192
He's too pompous
to stay in hiding for long.

36:44.285 --> 36:46.322
All right, everyone go home
and get some rest.

36:46.413 --> 36:47.848
We need to refocus
our energy on trying

36:47.872 --> 36:49.517
to figure out whatever
Dominic has planned.

36:49.541 --> 36:50.748
Good work.

36:50.834 --> 36:52.826
We still got a few hours
before Bethany leaves.

36:52.919 --> 36:55.502
I know... still time for pancakes.

36:55.588 --> 36:56.954
Briana?

37:00.677 --> 37:02.134
Great work today.

37:02.220 --> 37:03.381
Thank you.

37:03.471 --> 37:04.757
Yeah, I know
you've been meaning

37:04.848 --> 37:05.950
to get more out of this
for a while.

37:05.974 --> 37:07.806
And I think you're ready
for bigger things.

37:07.892 --> 37:09.758
So let's talk later this week.

37:09.853 --> 37:11.094
Thank you.

37:26.202 --> 37:27.864
Have you decided yet?

37:27.954 --> 37:30.913
I'm out. Whatever you're up to,
you can find somebody else.

37:30.999 --> 37:32.581
I'm sorry to hear that.

37:32.667 --> 37:34.909
<i>Both there's no time
for someone else.</i>

37:35.003 --> 37:36.960
<i>I just sent you something.</i>

37:38.214 --> 37:39.580
Oh, my God.

37:39.674 --> 37:41.506
<i>They seem like nice people.</i>

37:41.593 --> 37:43.710
I dropped by
for a visit today.

37:43.803 --> 37:45.339
<i>Don't worry,
they didn't see me.</i>

37:45.430 --> 37:46.921
If you hurt my parents...

37:47.015 --> 37:48.677
<i>Do as I ask
and I won't have to.</i>

37:49.476 --> 37:51.433
You told me I had a choice.

37:51.519 --> 37:52.955
<i>And ideally
you would've believed that</i>

37:52.979 --> 37:54.891
<i>and been a willing participant.</i>

37:54.981 --> 37:57.519
One way or another,
you're doing this today.

37:59.319 --> 38:00.435
Tell me when it's done.

38:12.874 --> 38:14.285
Talk to the doctor yet?

38:14.375 --> 38:15.436
Yeah, nothing
life-threatening.

38:15.460 --> 38:16.996
I'm fine.

38:17.086 --> 38:18.327
Thanks for earlier.

38:18.421 --> 38:19.753
If you hadn't been there...

38:19.839 --> 38:22.172
I'd have inherited
one sweet apartment.

38:22.258 --> 38:24.841
That's harsh.

38:25.762 --> 38:28.300
Silver lining, you know?

38:30.225 --> 38:31.511
Have a good non-date.

38:44.697 --> 38:46.734
Hey, Lexi, uh,

38:46.825 --> 38:48.942
I'm not gonna be able
to make coffee.

38:49.035 --> 38:50.901
I just got
swamped here at work.

38:50.995 --> 38:52.736
I'm gonna be here
for a while.

38:54.666 --> 38:55.782
Yeah.

39:02.799 --> 39:04.131
<i>Tweet, tweet.</i>

39:06.177 --> 39:07.258
Are you okay over there?

39:07.345 --> 39:09.302
Yeah, I... I'm just
making adjustments

39:09.389 --> 39:11.346
on the... new system.

39:12.851 --> 39:14.683
Okay, are you sure
you're not just

39:14.769 --> 39:16.260
making these mindless
little tweaks

39:16.354 --> 39:19.597
to avoid filling out
your adoption application?

39:20.859 --> 39:23.146
I told you,
I'm not filling it out.

39:23.236 --> 39:24.977
You don't have to.
I already did it for you.

39:25.071 --> 39:26.924
That's right, I just saved it
in your drafts folder.

39:26.948 --> 39:28.234
You just gotta hit "send."

39:28.324 --> 39:30.316
Excuse me,
I told you to drop it.

39:30.410 --> 39:31.776
You're welcome.

39:31.870 --> 39:33.202
These adoption lists
take forever.

39:33.288 --> 39:35.008
Even if you don't think
you'll want a family

39:35.081 --> 39:37.164
until way in the future,
you should do this now.

39:37.250 --> 39:38.250
I can't.

39:38.334 --> 39:40.826
My life is... is crazy.

39:40.920 --> 39:42.912
I mean, when would I
have time for a kid?

39:43.548 --> 39:45.255
When would we have time
for a kid?

39:45.341 --> 39:46.457
Oh, stop it.

39:50.179 --> 39:51.670
<i>Hi, Patterson.</i>

39:51.764 --> 39:53.005
Hey!

39:53.099 --> 39:54.465
<i>She says
she misses you.</i>

39:54.559 --> 39:56.095
Bethany, I miss you, too.

39:56.185 --> 39:57.847
Okay, I'm gonna
leave you to this.

39:57.937 --> 40:00.395
<i>We just wanted to show you
what she did.</i>

40:00.481 --> 40:02.126
Oh, wow,
I need to start working

40:02.150 --> 40:03.436
on a new puzzle
for you.

40:03.526 --> 40:04.812
<i>Since she finished
her puzzle,</i>

40:04.903 --> 40:05.903
<i>she gets pancakes.</i>

40:07.655 --> 40:08.655
<i>I love you.</i>

40:08.740 --> 40:10.322
Okay, bye.
I love you, too.

40:33.723 --> 40:35.589
Okay, okay, okay.

40:42.190 --> 40:43.601
Ta-da!

40:44.275 --> 40:45.482
There you are.

40:45.568 --> 40:47.088
Sorry. It took a little while.

40:47.153 --> 40:49.941
Someone fell in love
with a little Chihuahua

40:50.031 --> 40:51.031
on the way home.

40:51.115 --> 40:53.277
Wow, did you get to pet it?

40:53.368 --> 40:55.109
- Yes!
- Of course she did.

40:55.203 --> 40:57.160
It was too fluffy not to.

40:57.246 --> 40:58.487
- Hi.
- Hi.

40:59.999 --> 41:02.332
- That little one's amazing.
- Mm.

41:03.586 --> 41:05.498
I know our job is important.

41:05.588 --> 41:07.454
We're making the world
a better place.

41:07.548 --> 41:10.040
But I can't keep working
just for the future.

41:10.134 --> 41:12.091
I mean, we don't know
what's gonna happen.

41:12.178 --> 41:14.340
I do know...

41:14.430 --> 41:16.467
I wanna grab
as many moments as I can,

41:16.557 --> 41:18.093
and spend it with her...

41:19.769 --> 41:21.226
and you.

41:23.398 --> 41:24.479
I do.

41:25.650 --> 41:27.061
- Well...
- Yes?

41:27.151 --> 41:28.813
...what do you wanna do
with this moment?

41:28.903 --> 41:30.860
Well...

41:30.947 --> 41:34.190
should we go feed
the duckies at the pond?

41:36.494 --> 41:38.201
- Okay, uh...
- Hmm...

41:39.122 --> 41:40.704
- How about the zoo?
- Zoo!

41:40.790 --> 41:42.782
- Okay.
- Zoo it is!

41:42.875 --> 41:44.707
Okay, come on.

41:44.794 --> 41:47.161
Come on. Okay.

41:47.255 --> 41:48.996
Off to the zoo we go.

41:49.090 --> 41:50.501
Zoo!

42:51.277 --> 42:52.688
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
