01:06.965 --> 01:10.084
HONEY, DID YOU SEE MY BLUE CAMISOLE?

01:10.152 --> 01:13.955
I THINK I'D BE MORE OF A HELP
IF I KNEW WHAT A CAMISOLE WAS.

01:14.023 --> 01:16.140
IT'S LIKE A TANK TOP, ONLY... NICER.

01:16.208 --> 01:19.310
ANYWAY I TOOK IT OUT LAST
NIGHT AND NOW IT'S GONE.

01:19.378 --> 01:21.196
DIDN'T JUST GET UP

01:21.263 --> 01:24.565
I'M SORRY, DO YOU THINK I'M WEARING
IT UNDER HERE AND NOT TELLING YOU?

01:24.633 --> 01:26.901
COME ON! I WANNA

01:26.969 --> 01:29.271
I'M MEETING THAT GIRL

01:29.338 --> 01:31.021
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

01:31.089 --> 01:32.306
YOU KNOW THE THING THAT
MY COMPANY SPONSORS,

01:32.374 --> 01:34.910
WHERE YOU CAN VOLUNTEER
TO HELP A TROUBLED TEEN?

01:34.977 --> 01:36.311
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU
DIDN'T WANT TO DO THAT.

01:36.379 --> 01:37.645
DID NOT.

01:37.713 --> 01:39.047
YES YOU DID.
YOU SAID,

01:39.114 --> 01:40.881
"WHY WOULD I WANT TO SPEND MY
TIME WITH SOME PIMPLE-FACED REJECT

01:40.949 --> 01:43.451
WHO'S PROBABLY GONNA END
UP ROBBING A LIQUOR STORE?"

01:43.519 --> 01:45.853
DOUG, THE POINT IS
THAT I THOUGHT ABOUT IT,

01:45.921 --> 01:48.623
AND I CAN REALLY RELATE
TO THESE GIRLS, YOU KNOW?

01:48.690 --> 01:51.209
WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER, I
DID SOME MESSED-UP STUFF.

01:51.277 --> 01:53.428
AFTER MY MOM
DIED I...

01:53.496 --> 01:55.830
STARTED FLUNKING OUT
OF CLASSES, SHOPLIFTING-

01:55.898 --> 01:59.150
NOT TO MENTION
PROMISCUOUS AS HELL.

01:59.217 --> 02:00.835
WO-WHOAH, WHERE

SO YOU KNOW THE RULE.

02:20.856 --> 02:23.892

CHEWING, COULD BE YOURS.

02:25.160 --> 02:27.361

02:27.429 --> 02:31.249

AN I.P.S. TABLE.

02:55.457 --> 02:59.043

02:59.111 --> 03:00.061
WE KNEW THAT.

03:00.128 --> 03:02.229

THAT'S IT! EASY, EASY!

03:10.555 --> 03:11.923
HE'S NOT
WORTH IT.

03:11.991 --> 03:13.224
YOU KNOW
WHAT GUYS?

03:13.292 --> 03:14.809
I DON'T LIKE THE SMELL IN HERE.

03:19.515 --> 03:22.249
OH, BY THE WAY, TRY TO ENJOY YOUR
ICED TEA WITHOUT SWEET AND LOW.

03:30.225 --> 03:31.909

04:51.140 --> 04:54.943

04:58.113 --> 05:02.216
ANYWAY, I KNOW BEING 16 IS REALLY HARD,

05:02.284 --> 05:05.219
IT'S REALLY,
REALLY HARD.

05:08.207 --> 05:10.358
I MEAN, I WAS 16
WHEN MY MOM DIED.

05:10.425 --> 05:11.659
MY MOM'S NOT DEAD,

05:11.727 --> 05:15.096
SHE JUST SLEEPS WITH EVERY
DUDE WHO OWNS A GUITAR.

05:15.163 --> 05:16.964
MM-HM,
MM-HM.

05:17.032 --> 05:19.467
THAT CAN BE
ROUGH TOO.

05:21.487 --> 05:22.853
SO YOU LIKE
FRIES, HUH?

05:22.921 --> 05:24.055

DO YOU HAVE PLANNED?

05:46.895 --> 05:49.163

05:53.952 --> 05:55.219

05:59.908 --> 06:02.010
GINA, DEAR, WE CAN'T JUST TAKE OFF, OK?

06:02.077 --> 06:03.845
AS YOUR MENTOR, I SHOULD
TELL YOU, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

06:03.912 --> 06:05.646
TO OBEY THE LAW.

06:05.714 --> 06:07.164
THE WAITRESS
IS A JERK,

06:07.233 --> 06:08.466
THE FOOD
SUCKED-

06:08.534 --> 06:09.867

06:17.359 --> 06:19.193
I MEAN SERIOUSLY, IT'S RIDICULOUS.

06:19.261 --> 06:21.529
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS A MILLION TIMES.

OH MY GOD,

07:02.738 --> 07:05.306

10:58.273 --> 11:00.525

TO TALK TO YOU.

11:00.592 --> 11:02.843
DID HE SAY HE NEEDED TO TALK TO
ME OR HE WANTED TO TALK TO ME?

11:02.861 --> 11:04.562
I DON'T KNOW, WHAT'S
THE DIFFERENCE?

11:04.663 --> 11:05.813
CARRIE, IT'S

11:05.880 --> 11:07.748
WAS HE ANGRY,

11:07.816 --> 11:10.351
DID HE SOUND LIKE A MAN
WHO HAD BEEN BETRAYED?

11:10.419 --> 11:12.320
OK, WHAT'S

11:49.858 --> 11:52.709
DOUG, I CAN'T SEE WHY
YOU CAN'T BE FRIENDS.

11:52.777 --> 11:55.279
I MEAN, YOU LIKE THE GUY.
YOU BOTH DO THE SAME THING.

11:55.347 --> 11:58.782
OH, THEN WHY AREN'T YOU HANGING OUT
WITH SOMEBODY WHO WORKS AT A RIVAL...

11:58.850 --> 12:02.219
OFFICE PLACE
COMPANY, HUH?

12:02.254 --> 12:05.939
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I
DO FOR A LIVING DO YOU?

12:06.007 --> 12:08.408
THIS ISN'T
ABOUT YOU!

12:11.163 --> 12:14.815
OH MY GOD, YOU ARE GONNA LOOK
SO PRETTY IN THAT TOP WE BOUGHT.

12:14.883 --> 12:17.084
I KNOW, AND I CAN'T
BELIEVE IT WAS 50% OFF.

12:17.151 --> 12:19.287
WELL, IT WASN'T
UNTIL MAMA TOOK

12:19.354 --> 12:21.489
THE PRICE TAG OFF THAT
RAIN COAT. HEH HEH HEH.

12:23.508 --> 12:25.209
GOOD WORK, HUH?
HAH!

12:25.277 --> 12:27.478
ANYWAY YOU'RE TOTALLY WEARING
THAT TOMORROW WHEN WE GO CLUBBING.

12:27.545 --> 12:30.314
CARRIE, I CAN'T GO
CLUBBING, I'M ONLY 16.

12:30.381 --> 12:33.251
YOU'RE RIGHT, GINA CAN'T
GO CLUBBING, BUT UH,

12:33.318 --> 12:36.386
"BETH WYCOWSKI" CAN!

12:36.454 --> 12:38.121
YOU GOT ME
A FAKE I.D.?

12:38.189 --> 12:39.590
THAT'S WHAT MENTORS
DO. THERE YOU GO.

12:39.658 --> 12:41.726
AW, THANKS.

12:41.793 --> 12:45.930
OK. ALL RIGHT, I'LL
TALK TO YOU LATER. OK.

12:48.734 --> 12:50.701
WHAT'S THAT ABOUT
A FAKE I.D.?

12:50.769 --> 12:52.670
NOTHING.

12:52.738 --> 12:54.471
SOUNDED LIKE
SOMETHING TO ME.

12:54.539 --> 12:56.140
LOOK, IT'S
MY BUSINESS OK?

12:56.207 --> 12:58.308
I DON'T THINK I LIKE
YOUR ATTITUDE, YOUNG LADY!

12:58.376 --> 13:00.494
I DON'T THINK
I CARE.

13:00.562 --> 13:03.080
OH, I SEE WE'VE
STARTED SMOKING.

13:03.148 --> 13:04.715
HOW VERY
SOPHISTICATED.

13:04.783 --> 13:07.951
LOOK, I'M HOLDING THEM FOR A FRIEND,
ALL RIGHT? GET OFF MY BACK ALREADY.

13:08.019 --> 13:09.119
I WILL NOT.

13:09.187 --> 13:10.554
YOU'RE PAINTED UP LIKE A WHORE

13:10.622 --> 13:13.023
AND YOU'RE SMOKING LIKE A CHIMNEY.

13:13.091 --> 13:14.792
THE WHORE PART
I'M USED TO,

13:14.859 --> 13:17.328
BUT THE CIGARETTES WILL KILL YA.

13:19.247 --> 13:21.381
LOOK, I'M JUST HAVING
SOME FUN, ALL RIGHT?

13:21.449 --> 13:23.267
BEING A MENTOR ISN'T ABOUT HAVING FUN.

13:23.335 --> 13:25.502
IT'S ABOUT BEING
A PROPER EXAMPLE.

13:25.570 --> 13:27.054
LIKE YOU KNOW A LOT
ABOUT THAT, RIGHT?

13:27.122 --> 13:28.906
GO TO YOUR ROOM! NO.

13:28.974 --> 13:32.376
YOU'VE JUST LOST YOUR
ALLOWANCE, YOUNG LADY!

13:32.443 --> 13:34.177
OK, I GIVE YOU
AN ALLOWANCE.

13:34.245 --> 13:37.731
YES. ACTUALLY, I'M GOING
TO NEED AN ADVANCE ON THAT.

13:51.245 --> 13:53.614
ANYWAY, WE'LL MEET
AT COOPER'S AT 7:00

13:53.682 --> 13:55.583
AND WE'LL GO TO
THE CONCERT FROM THERE.

13:55.650 --> 13:56.984
OK, OH, AND BY THE WAY,

13:57.052 --> 13:58.886
YOU LEFT YOUR
SWEATER IN MY CAR.

13:58.954 --> 14:01.121
NOT THE V-NECK
THE OTHER ONE.

14:03.058 --> 14:04.758
OK, I GOT HEAT,
I GOTTA GO.

14:04.826 --> 14:06.326
HEY, GUYS.

14:06.394 --> 14:09.597
HEY. WHAT'S GOING ON
IN, UH, DEACONVILLE?

14:09.665 --> 14:12.299
ME AND DANNY GOTTA DO
ANOTHER HALF SHIFT TONIGHT.

14:12.367 --> 14:13.083
YEAH, HOW COME?

14:13.151 --> 14:14.969
AW, O'BOYLE'S LIKE A DOG WITH A BONE

14:15.036 --> 14:17.138
ABOUT KEEPING UP
WITH PRIORITY PLUS.

14:17.205 --> 14:19.073
THOSE GUYS RUN A PRETTY TIGHT OPERATION,

14:19.140 --> 14:21.374
MAYBE WE COULD, UH, YOU KNOW,
LEARN SOMETHING FROM THEM.

14:21.442 --> 14:24.595
CAN'T LEARN ANYTHING FROM THOSE GUYS,
THEY'RE A BUNCH OF ARROGANT JERKS.

14:24.662 --> 14:26.931
"JERKS" IS A
PRETTY UGLY WORD.

14:26.998 --> 14:31.619
OK, HOW'S "ASS-WIPE"
WORK FOR YA?

14:31.687 --> 14:35.606
HUH. GUESS I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO DOESN'T THINK HATE IS FUNNY.

14:35.674 --> 14:38.242
WHAT'S WITH YOU? NOTHING.

14:40.545 --> 14:42.646
I LIKE A
PRIORITY PLUS GUY!

14:44.566 --> 14:46.583
LOOK, YOU HEARD ME OK?

14:46.651 --> 14:48.202
I LIKE ONE OF THEIR
GUYS, YOU KNOW,

14:48.269 --> 14:50.204
AND I DON'T CARE
WHO KNOWS IT.

14:53.174 --> 14:55.042
I- I CAN'T BELIEVE
WHAT I'M HEARING.

14:55.109 --> 14:56.577
LOOK, I DIDN'T MEAN FOR
IT TO HAPPEN, ALL RIGHT?

14:56.645 --> 14:57.844
I MEAN, THE GUY,

14:57.912 --> 14:59.380
HE TOWED MY TRUCK
OUT OF A DRIVE-THRU,

14:59.447 --> 15:01.482
SOMETHING YOU GUYS
WOULD NEVER DO FOR ME.

15:01.550 --> 15:05.753
I TOWED YOU OUT OF A WENDY'S
DRIVE-THRU NOT A MONTH AGO!

15:08.690 --> 15:11.675
YEAH, AND I PULLED YOU OUT OF
A TUBE IN A McDONALD'S PLAYLAND.

15:14.729 --> 15:15.829
WHATEVER, ALL RIGHT?
THE POINT IS,

15:15.897 --> 15:17.047
YOU KNOW I LOVE I.P.S.

15:17.115 --> 15:18.616
I BLEED GREEN!

15:18.683 --> 15:20.684
OH, COME ON DANNY,
YOU'RE WITH ME RIGHT?

15:20.752 --> 15:21.502
YOU BROKE MY HEART.

15:23.888 --> 15:26.940
YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M SORRY,
ALL RIGHT? BUT I LIKE JACK.

15:27.008 --> 15:30.894
HE LIKES NEIL DIAMOND, AND
TONIGHT THE 3 OF US, WE ARE ONE.

15:37.268 --> 15:38.669
HEY, THERE YOU ARE.

15:38.737 --> 15:40.287
YOU WANT TO, UH,
TAKE MY CAR?

15:40.354 --> 15:41.521
NAH, WE'LL TAKE
MINE. COME ON.

15:41.589 --> 15:45.759
WHERE IS IT? IT'S OVER
HERE, KEEP WALKING.

15:45.827 --> 15:47.894
I DON'T SEE...
YOUR CAR.

15:47.962 --> 15:49.246
BOYS!

15:54.036 --> 15:57.821
IF THEY'RE COMING, I DIDN'T
ORDER ENOUGH POPCORN CHICKEN.

15:59.424 --> 16:00.758
YOU SET ME UP
THE WHOLE TIME?

16:00.826 --> 16:02.392
YEAH.

16:02.460 --> 16:05.963
WHAT DO YOU THINK, I REALLY WANNA
BE FRIENDS WITH AN I.P.S. DRIVER?

16:06.031 --> 16:07.448
WHAT ABOUT THE LUNCHES,
THE MOVIES, THE-

16:07.516 --> 16:09.583
THE ROLLERBLADING

16:11.686 --> 16:13.637
HOW'D YOU KNOW
I LIKE NEIL DIAMOND?

16:13.705 --> 16:15.889
ALL THE FAT BOYS
LIKE HIM.

16:15.957 --> 16:17.507
I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE.

16:17.575 --> 16:18.809
I REALLY DON'T THINK
THAT'S TRUE.

16:39.064 --> 16:41.131
WORKING LATE HUH?

16:41.199 --> 16:43.867
WHAT THE HELL?

16:43.935 --> 16:45.001

MAN,

16:53.094 --> 16:54.527
I TOLD YOU,

16:54.595 --> 16:56.529
YOU SHOULD'VE NEVER TRUSTED THAT GUY.

16:56.597 --> 16:57.515
AW, GREAT.

16:57.582 --> 17:00.150
THEY PULLED A
BUBBLE MUMMY ON YA.

17:00.218 --> 17:02.720
MAN, HOW ARE WE EVER GONNA SHOW
OUR FACES AROUND COOPER'S AGAIN?

17:02.787 --> 17:04.271
SIMPLE, WE GO

17:04.338 --> 17:07.339
WE TAKE BACK OUR TABLE,

17:10.178 --> 17:14.013
GUY, EASY AROUND
THE FUN ZONE.

17:14.082 --> 17:15.182

17:19.371 --> 17:20.569
HEY.

17:20.637 --> 17:21.872
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU

17:21.940 --> 17:24.641
WE'RE GONNA GO SEE "THE
THUNDER FROM DOWN UNDER,"

17:24.709 --> 17:26.009
ALL MALE REVUE.

17:26.077 --> 17:27.377
YOU DON'T WANT THOSE
AUSTRALIAN HOTTIES

17:27.444 --> 17:28.845
TO SEE YOU
DRESSED LIKE THAT.

17:28.913 --> 17:31.448
ACTUALLY, ME AND MY MOM
HAD A REALLY NICE TALK AND

17:31.515 --> 17:33.450
I THINK SHE'S FINALLY
GETTING HER ACT TOGETHER.

17:33.517 --> 17:36.237
OH, YEAH? YOU KNOW WHO ELSE
IS GETTING THEIR ACT TOGETHER?

17:36.304 --> 17:39.089

NOW LETS GET YOU CHANGED!

17:39.156 --> 17:40.740

17:40.809 --> 17:43.076
I SHOULD MAKE SOME
CHANGES TOO, SO

17:43.144 --> 17:47.131
I THINK I'M JUST GONNA STAY HOME
AND STUDY FOR MY CHEMISTRY TEST.

17:47.198 --> 17:48.298
OH, PLEASE.

17:48.366 --> 17:50.433
LIKE YOU'RE GONNA BE
A CHEMIST, RIGHT?

17:52.203 --> 17:54.404
OH, MY GOD.

17:54.472 --> 17:58.291
I'M SO SORRY. I'VE
BEEN A HORRIBLE MENTOR.

17:58.359 --> 18:00.260
NO, NO, NO.
YOU WERE GREAT.

18:00.328 --> 18:04.164
I MEAN, YOU TAUGHT ME
HOW TO HOT-WIRE A MOPED.

18:04.232 --> 18:06.484
YES, EXACTLY.

18:06.551 --> 18:08.419
YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO.

18:08.487 --> 18:10.270
YEAH, I SHOULD.

18:10.338 --> 18:12.539
BUT LISTEN, IF YOU
NEVER NEED ANY ADVICE,

18:12.607 --> 18:14.140
PLEASE CALL ME.

18:14.209 --> 18:15.576
I PROBABLY WON'T.

18:15.643 --> 18:16.943
YEAH, YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T.
ALL RIGHT, GOOD LUCK.

18:17.011 --> 18:18.345
ALL RIGHT.

18:28.940 --> 18:30.173
WELL.

18:30.241 --> 18:33.176
LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY
RETURNED MY PACKAGE.

18:33.244 --> 18:35.829
I GUESS THIS IS
WHAT YOU CALL BULK MAIL.

18:37.548 --> 18:39.299
THAT'S PRETTY
FUNNY, JACK.

18:39.367 --> 18:41.702
BUT YOU GUYS AIN'T GONNA
TAKE COOPER'S FROM US.

18:41.770 --> 18:43.020
YOU CAN STAY.

18:43.087 --> 18:46.190
THERE'S A NICE LITTLE TABLE
OVER THERE BY THE BATHROOM.

18:49.694 --> 18:52.095
OH, SOMEBODY'S GONNA BE
SITTING AT THAT TABLE,

18:52.163 --> 18:54.664
BUT IT'S GONNA
BE YOU LADIES.

19:01.723 --> 19:03.357

19:03.424 --> 19:05.892
THAT GONNA HAPPEN?

19:08.779 --> 19:10.146
BOYS!

19:27.048 --> 19:28.916
OK, IT'S A MOMENT
LIKE THIS,

19:28.983 --> 19:30.884

OUR MANHOOD. HM?

20:22.053 --> 20:25.688
THAT... WAS A MISTAKE.

20:25.756 --> 20:30.094
WOOAAAAHHHHH!

20:44.258 --> 20:46.376
ARE YOU
LISTENING TO ME?
