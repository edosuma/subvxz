00:06.340 --> 00:06.507
.

00:06.540 --> 00:07.441
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:08.742 --> 00:10.344
sexually based offenses

00:10.378 --> 00:12.180
are considered
especially heinous.

00:12.213 --> 00:14.248
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.282 --> 00:16.117
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.150 --> 00:17.485
are members of an elite squad

00:17.518 --> 00:19.553
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.587 --> 00:22.323
These are their stories.

00:25.526 --> 00:32.566
*

00:53.454 --> 00:55.789
Stop doing that!
You're scaring me.

00:55.823 --> 00:57.258
- Well, we can't have that.

00:57.291 --> 00:58.826
How 'bout a drink,
non

00:58.859 --> 01:00.794
What are you, 15?

01:00.828 --> 01:02.563
- 16.

01:02.596 --> 01:05.133
Sweet 16.

01:08.169 --> 01:09.303
*

01:09.337 --> 01:11.339
- We don't party
like this at home.

01:11.372 --> 01:13.507
- Pennsylvania.

01:13.541 --> 01:15.709
We're here on spring break
with our music class.

01:15.743 --> 01:17.445
- Haley's a piano prodigy.

01:17.478 --> 01:19.447
She's gonna play at
Carnegie Hall one day.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.682
- Tonight,
I just wanna have fun.

01:21.715 --> 01:23.617
You and me.

01:23.651 --> 01:27.588
*

01:30.624 --> 01:37.398
*

01:40.601 --> 01:44.838
*

01:44.872 --> 01:46.607
The left one.

01:46.640 --> 01:53.681
*

01:56.817 --> 01:58.352
- Surprise.

01:58.386 --> 02:00.554
- Happy birthday, Dad.

02:00.588 --> 02:02.423
- Nah. Wow.

02:02.456 --> 02:03.691
Thank you.

02:03.724 --> 02:06.327
Clown cake?
- Jayden picked it out.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.830
Hey, this is
my grandson, y'all.

02:09.863 --> 02:11.332
- That's what's up.

02:11.365 --> 02:13.667
- Come to Pop-Pop.
What's up, man?

02:13.701 --> 02:16.504
You guys did incredible, man.
It's been a while.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.372
- Hey, you've got your life,
we've got ours,

02:18.406 --> 02:21.575
but family's family.
- Family's family!

02:23.677 --> 02:25.179
Thank you, thank you.

02:25.213 --> 02:26.514
- I'll go get some plates
from the break room.

02:26.547 --> 02:27.915
- He really seemed surprised.
- So nice.

02:27.948 --> 02:29.483
Ken and Alejandro
did a good job.

02:29.517 --> 02:31.252
- Look at Fin; he's just
this happy, mellow grandpa.

02:31.285 --> 02:32.786
- Yeah, my advice:
Don't say that to his face.

02:33.954 --> 02:35.489
- Hey, here you go.
- Hey.

02:35.523 --> 02:37.391
- So, Fin's son, Ken,
is married to Alejandro?

02:37.425 --> 02:40.261
- Yeah, and they had baby Jaden
about a year ago in November,

02:40.294 --> 02:42.930
and Fin is over the moon.

02:42.963 --> 02:44.665
- Good for him.

02:44.698 --> 02:46.734
- Oh, you're welcome
to stay for cake, if you like.

02:46.767 --> 02:49.370
- I, uh--I have an appointment
I can't miss.

02:49.403 --> 02:51.972
Tell Fin happy birthday.
- Sure.

02:53.807 --> 02:55.609
- Haley!

02:55.643 --> 02:59.813
*

02:59.847 --> 03:02.416
Hey, have you seen Haley?

03:02.450 --> 03:04.718
- My friend, Haley.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.487
*

03:06.520 --> 03:08.889
- Sorry.

03:08.922 --> 03:11.559
- It's me.
Where are you?

03:11.592 --> 03:13.294
We have to get back
to the hotel.

03:13.327 --> 03:15.829
It's past curfew.

03:15.863 --> 03:19.700
This isn't funny.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.435
Are you okay?

03:21.469 --> 03:24.872
Oh, my God, we're both
gonna be in so much trouble,

03:24.905 --> 03:26.974
so call me back, please.

03:29.009 --> 03:31.645
Haley!

03:31.679 --> 03:35.416
*

03:38.619 --> 03:45.626
*

04:22.996 --> 04:24.532
- Thanks, I think
I'll keep him.

04:24.565 --> 04:26.900
- Hey, has Jayden seen
"Paw Patrol"?

04:26.934 --> 04:28.502
I mean, Jesse is
obsessed with it.

04:28.536 --> 04:31.071
You gotta watch it.
- No, I don't.

04:33.707 --> 04:35.376
- There's a missing
16-year-old girl.

04:35.409 --> 04:36.777
The precinct sent them here.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.512
- I'm Detective Rollins;
this is Detective Carisi.

04:38.546 --> 04:41.382
- Look, you have to find Haley.
Please.

04:41.415 --> 04:44.552
I'm head chaperone.
This is all my fault.

04:44.585 --> 04:46.987
- So, you're one of
Haley's teachers?

04:47.020 --> 04:48.722
Mister...
- Turner. James Turner.

04:48.756 --> 04:50.391
I'm her music teacher.

04:50.424 --> 04:51.759
Charlotte,
the other chaperone, and I,

04:51.792 --> 04:54.562
are supervising 15 girls.
We're from Beaver Falls.

04:54.595 --> 04:57.030
- Birthplace of Joe Namath.
- Uh, that's right.

04:57.064 --> 04:59.099
Um, look, none of these kids

04:59.132 --> 05:01.435
have ever been
to New York before.

05:01.469 --> 05:02.670
I should've kept a closer eye.

05:02.703 --> 05:04.605
- Okay, so, what happened
last night?

05:04.638 --> 05:06.540
- Haley and Jenni
must've snuck out.

05:06.574 --> 05:07.975
It's supposed to be
lights out at 10:00.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.943
- Does Haley know anyone
here in New York,

05:09.977 --> 05:12.079
maybe a boyfriend?

05:12.112 --> 05:14.081
- No, Haley doesn't
have boyfriends.

05:14.114 --> 05:16.384
Her whole life is the piano.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.818
And nobody at school
is good enough.

05:17.851 --> 05:21.021
- All right, sit down.
Um, what about a home life?

05:22.723 --> 05:24.558
No, I can't imagine that.
Her parents are so devoted.

05:24.592 --> 05:26.126
They're on their way here
right now.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.661
- And when did you first
find out that she was missing?

05:27.695 --> 05:29.563
- Jenni woke me up
at 6:00 this morning,

05:29.597 --> 05:31.565
and I told James right away.

05:31.599 --> 05:33.501
So Haley and Jenni
were out all night?

05:33.534 --> 05:35.002
- I know we shouldn't
have gone to that club,

05:35.035 --> 05:37.438
but it was 16 and over,
so I thought it would be safe.

05:37.471 --> 05:39.473
- Okay, and how long
were you and Haley there?

05:39.507 --> 05:41.575
- I checked my phone,
and it was 10:00.

05:41.609 --> 05:42.876
I tried looking
for her everywhere,

05:42.910 --> 05:44.578
but it was like she vanished.

05:44.612 --> 05:46.580
I know I should've gone
back to the hotel, but--

05:46.614 --> 05:49.817
- I thought I could find her.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.151
I went to Carnegie Hall,

05:51.184 --> 05:53.721
and, um, that place
where the philharmonic plays.

05:55.088 --> 05:56.524
- Yeah, she dreamed
of those places,

05:56.557 --> 05:58.459
so I thought maybe
she decided to go there.

05:58.492 --> 06:00.127
- And did you notice
Haley hanging out with

06:00.160 --> 06:01.995
anybody in particular
at the club?

06:02.029 --> 06:06.099
- Yeah, she was dancing a lot
with this guy in a clown mask.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.868
He was older.

06:07.901 --> 06:10.738
- Jenni and Haley were
at the Majesty on the Bowery

06:10.771 --> 06:12.906
at a circus-themed dance party
from 8:00 till 10:00.

06:12.940 --> 06:14.975
- Okay, check with the club,
pull the security footage.

06:15.008 --> 06:16.544
- And she didn't use
her ATM card.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.045
Uh, no red flags
on her social media.

06:19.613 --> 06:20.914
- No, the only incoming call
was from Jenni.

06:20.948 --> 06:22.149
Haley's phone died
before midnight.

06:22.182 --> 06:24.752
- Okay, look,
she is 16 years old.

06:24.785 --> 06:26.620
Best-case scenario is,
she met a guy

06:26.654 --> 06:28.021
and she lost track of time.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.957
Worst case...

06:29.990 --> 06:31.959
let's not go there.

06:31.992 --> 06:34.495
- Haley's parents are here.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.667
- Send 'em in.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.570
- You see stories like this
on the news.

06:42.603 --> 06:43.704
You never think
it could happen to you.

06:43.737 --> 06:44.872
- We don't know
that your daughter

06:44.905 --> 06:46.474
is necessarily in danger.

06:46.507 --> 06:47.508
- No, someone took her,
all right? I know it.

06:49.009 --> 06:50.511
You agreed to the trip.
You always give in to her--

06:50.544 --> 06:51.912
- There's no one to blame here.

06:51.945 --> 06:53.814
Why don't--why don't
you both have a seat?

06:53.847 --> 06:56.850
When is the last time
you spoke with Haley?

06:56.884 --> 06:58.452
- Yesterday at breakfast.

06:58.486 --> 07:00.854
- Okay, now, does she know
anyone here in New York?

07:00.888 --> 07:02.055
- No.
- No.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.525
- Maybe--maybe she met
someone online?

07:04.558 --> 07:06.026
- She's still a little girl.

07:06.059 --> 07:07.661
I mean, she--she doesn't even
have her credit card yet.

07:07.695 --> 07:09.497
She plays, uh, games
on her cell phone.

07:09.530 --> 07:10.931
- We did check
her social media.

07:10.964 --> 07:13.767
I mean, it's possible that
she has, uh, a fake account,

07:13.801 --> 07:15.936
like finsta,
something she kept hidden.

07:15.969 --> 07:16.937
- Not Haley.

07:16.970 --> 07:19.507
- Liv, you gotta see this.

07:19.540 --> 07:22.175
- James, you were
supposed to take care of her,

07:22.209 --> 07:23.611
keep her safe.

07:23.644 --> 07:24.812
- Okay, come on,
let's go this way.

07:24.845 --> 07:26.680
- Look, like--like I said,

07:26.714 --> 07:27.881
there's--there's no one
to blame here, okay?

07:27.915 --> 07:29.517
Why don't we have a seat?

07:29.550 --> 07:30.918
- All right, look,
just please find our daughter.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.654
- Excuse me, I'll--
I'll be back in a moment.

07:35.989 --> 07:39.660
- It was in his spam folder.
- I just found it.

07:39.693 --> 07:42.563
Sent last night at 11:20
from Haley's phone.

07:42.596 --> 07:44.698
- You shouldn't have
gotten in this car.

07:44.732 --> 07:46.834
- Stop it.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.802
Take it off.

07:51.839 --> 07:58.879
*

08:02.015 --> 08:03.283
- She seems terrified.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.185
- Balzarini Brothers.
I know the place.

08:05.218 --> 08:06.887
It's the best butcher shop
in Brooklyn.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.822
- Start there.

08:08.856 --> 08:13.994
*

08:14.027 --> 08:16.864
Uh, maybe a customer?

08:16.897 --> 08:19.533
- Yeah, he works here.
Vinny Drago. He's in the back.

08:19.567 --> 08:22.202
Uh, what did he do?
- We'll let you know.

08:25.138 --> 08:26.840
Hey, Vinny?

08:26.874 --> 08:28.308
- Don't interrupt
a man mid-hack.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.743
- We've gotta ask you
a few questions,

08:29.777 --> 08:31.779
so please put the cleaver down.

08:34.147 --> 08:37.585
- Make it quick. I gotta bone,
roll, and tie carcasses in 20.

08:37.618 --> 08:40.153
- Were you at the Majesty
Lounge last night?

08:40.187 --> 08:42.055
- It's possible.
- I'll take that as a yes.

08:42.089 --> 08:43.991
You know a girl
named Haley Sadler?

08:44.024 --> 08:45.158
- No.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.994
- Maybe this will refresh
your memory.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.996
Yeah, I might've met her.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.330
- Yeah, you might've met her.
Well, you two were caught

08:50.363 --> 08:52.099
on a security camera
leaving together.

08:52.132 --> 08:54.635
- Okay, look, she was 16.

08:54.668 --> 08:57.170
We didn't do anything,
like, nothing, actually.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.606
- Where'd all this
nothing happen?

08:58.639 --> 09:00.073
- Went back to my apartment.

09:01.842 --> 09:04.645
No--oh,
we passed out on my couch,

09:04.678 --> 09:05.879
I woke up, she was gone,

09:05.913 --> 09:07.314
so whatever she's saying,
she's lying.

09:07.347 --> 09:08.916
- She's not saying
anything, actually,

09:08.949 --> 09:10.751
and we're gonna need to
check out your place.

09:10.784 --> 09:13.086
Let's go.

09:16.123 --> 09:19.292
*

09:19.326 --> 09:21.762
Hello

09:21.795 --> 09:24.297
Hello?

09:24.331 --> 09:26.366
- Clear.
- I told you, she's not here.

09:29.336 --> 09:30.938
Hello?

09:30.971 --> 09:37.978
*

09:40.047 --> 09:43.083
- Nobody's in the bedroom.
- Carisi...

09:43.116 --> 09:44.985
*

09:45.018 --> 09:47.688
Here. Look at that.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.322
- That looks like Haley's.
- Yeah.

09:49.356 --> 09:52.660
*

09:52.693 --> 09:54.828
That looks like blood.

09:54.862 --> 09:57.631
*

09:57.665 --> 10:00.000
There's more blood there...

10:00.033 --> 10:01.368
and there's more blood.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.637
- Oh, Christ.
- Yeah.

10:03.671 --> 10:05.238
Okay, this is
an active crime scene.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.807
Nobody in or out.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.176
Have CSU check
the bathroom, the tub.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.378
Process every inch
of this apartment.

10:11.411 --> 10:12.680
And search the building.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.014
I want the whole block
searched.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.649
- Would somebody tell me
what the hell's going on?

10:15.683 --> 10:16.850
- You need to come with us
to the station...

10:16.884 --> 10:18.251
Why?
- So you can tell us

10:18.285 --> 10:19.419
what the hell happened
to Haley Sadler.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.789
*

10:25.025 --> 10:25.192
.

10:25.225 --> 10:26.193
- I didn't hurt that girl.
- We're not saying that.

10:27.995 --> 10:28.962
- And nobody's saying that
she's hurt, except for you.

10:28.996 --> 10:30.263
You

10:30.297 --> 10:31.665
- No, I just meant
that she's missing.

10:31.699 --> 10:32.933
- Well, as far as we know,

10:32.966 --> 10:34.001
you're the last person
to see her alive.

10:34.034 --> 10:35.402
- I didn't kill her!
Jeez.

10:35.435 --> 10:37.738
- She was at your apartment.

10:37.771 --> 10:39.206
You two have sex?
- No.

10:39.239 --> 10:41.909
I told you, I woke up,
she was gone.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.243
Maybe she met some other guy.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.078
- Maybe, but we found
her purse and her cell phone

10:45.112 --> 10:48.682
in a garbage can on your block.
- That's crazy!

10:48.716 --> 10:50.718
- That's crazy.
You know what else is crazy?

10:50.751 --> 10:52.886
You remember that feather boa
she was wearing?

10:52.920 --> 10:56.089
Well, we found that in your
bathroom, covered in blood.

10:56.123 --> 10:57.791
There was blood
in your car, Vinny.

10:57.825 --> 10:59.292
- No, no, no, okay,
you got it all wrong.

10:59.326 --> 11:00.728
Look, we were just having fun.

11:00.761 --> 11:02.696
- Yeah.

11:02.730 --> 11:04.431
- Well...

11:11.038 --> 11:13.440
- That doesn't sound like
she's having fun to me.

11:13.473 --> 11:14.808
That sounds like
she's terrified.

11:14.842 --> 11:16.009
- That's not how it was.

11:16.043 --> 11:18.712
She said she liked
being scared.

11:18.746 --> 11:20.113
- Uh, okay.

11:20.147 --> 11:22.850
Well, let's say that
we misinterpreted that.

11:22.883 --> 11:25.052
- Doesn't explain the blood.

11:25.085 --> 11:27.120
- I work in a butcher shop!
- Yeah, we thought of that too,

11:27.154 --> 11:30.057
but the techs said
that it's definitely human.

11:30.090 --> 11:31.925
We pulled the DNA sample
from Haley's toothbrush.

11:31.959 --> 11:33.393
We're running that
in the lab right now.

11:33.426 --> 11:36.764
But here's something that, uh--
that we did think about.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.766
Maybe this whole thing's
an accident.

11:38.799 --> 11:39.933
- She somehow cut herself.

11:39.967 --> 11:42.069
- Yeah, she fell,
she hit her head.

11:42.102 --> 11:45.438
Because if this is an accident,
that's a different situation.

11:45.472 --> 11:47.140
- Well, then she must have.

11:47.174 --> 11:49.376
- Yeah, well, that--that
makes sense with the blood.

11:49.409 --> 11:50.978
Is--is that what you're saying,
Vinny?

11:51.011 --> 11:52.479
Sh

11:52.512 --> 11:54.181
- Looked bad, you panicked.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.083
- If that's what happened,
then we can work with that.

11:56.116 --> 11:59.519
We can help you, Vinny.
- Screw you.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.989
Pretending you're on my side.
I--I don't need any friends.

12:02.022 --> 12:04.391
- Oh, yes, you do, Vinny.
This does not look good.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.960
- Because right now,
you're telling us that Haley--

12:06.994 --> 12:08.862
that's her name.
Say her name, Vinny.

12:08.896 --> 12:10.063
- Haley.
Whatever.

12:10.097 --> 12:11.832
- You're saying that
Haley cut herself,

12:11.865 --> 12:13.100
bled all over your apartment,

12:13.133 --> 12:14.434
left in the middle
of the night...

12:14.467 --> 12:16.269
- Mm, mm-hmm.
- Took her phone, her purse,

12:16.303 --> 12:17.470
threw it in the trash on your
block, and then disappeared?

12:17.504 --> 12:19.406
- All I know, it wasn't me!

12:19.439 --> 12:21.809
- No...

12:21.842 --> 12:23.811
Of course not.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.782
- So, our suspect is a butcher

12:28.816 --> 12:30.183
who likes to dress up
as a clown?

12:30.217 --> 12:31.318
- Vincent Drago, 22.

12:31.351 --> 12:34.021
Has a history of DV,
stalking, menacing.

12:34.054 --> 12:35.789
His ex-girlfriend has
a restraining order

12:35.823 --> 12:37.157
out against him.

12:37.190 --> 12:39.192
- He threatened her
with a cleaver.

12:39.226 --> 12:41.795
- Anger management issues
and access to knives, great.

12:41.829 --> 12:42.896
- Yeah, we've got
a call-in to the ex

12:42.930 --> 12:44.331
to see if there was more there.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.066
- Look, clown mask aside,
I don't make him as a serial.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.935
- No, but I'm sure that
we could come up with

12:47.968 --> 12:49.469
about half-a-dozen theories

12:49.502 --> 12:52.505
of how a young girl could
wind up dead in his apartment.

12:52.539 --> 12:54.041
- How does he get
rid of the body?

12:54.074 --> 12:55.308
That's tough to pull off
without leaving a trail.

12:55.342 --> 12:57.344
- We're canvasing,
and unfortunately,

12:57.377 --> 13:00.080
there are no security cams in
his building or on his street.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.215
- Uh, lab results are back.

13:02.249 --> 13:03.350
Oh...

13:03.383 --> 13:05.518
The blood in his apartment
and his car

13:05.552 --> 13:06.954
are a match to Haley,

13:06.987 --> 13:09.322
and they also found
traces of bleach.

13:09.356 --> 13:11.892
- Yeah, your working theory
just became probable cause.

13:11.925 --> 13:13.226
Make the arrest.

13:13.260 --> 13:15.595
- But there's--
there's something else.

13:15.628 --> 13:18.498
CSU found that in his car.

13:20.133 --> 13:23.103
- That's Haley's necklace.
- She was in his car.

13:23.136 --> 13:26.239
- They found that
in his trunk.

13:26.273 --> 13:28.375
*

13:28.408 --> 13:31.979
- I gave Haley that necklace
on her 13th birthday.

13:33.981 --> 13:35.916
- Yes.

13:35.949 --> 13:39.286
- We're still looking.

13:42.289 --> 13:45.125
- There was blood in the car...

13:45.158 --> 13:48.495
and in his apartment.

13:51.031 --> 13:53.366
It was--it was Haley's.

13:56.069 --> 13:57.604
- He denies that
he had anything to do

13:57.637 --> 13:59.506
with her disappearance.

13:59.539 --> 14:02.409
- All right,
I wanna talk to him.

14:02.442 --> 14:04.211
I wanna look that
son of a bitch in the eye--

14:04.244 --> 14:06.013
- It's not gonna be possible.

14:06.046 --> 14:07.347
- Well, what are
we supposed to do?

14:07.380 --> 14:08.615
Just sit around the hotel,
waiting by the phone?

14:08.648 --> 14:11.018
- Chris...

14:11.051 --> 14:13.320
- It's okay.

14:13.353 --> 14:17.958
I can assure you that we are
doing everything in our power.

14:17.991 --> 14:19.426
- Not good enough.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.561
I--I want you to promise us
that you'll find her.

14:21.594 --> 14:23.363
- We wanna be realistic.

14:23.396 --> 14:26.566
We ask you to hope for
the best, but...prepare--

14:26.599 --> 14:29.302
- No, I'm not preparing
for anything, all right?

14:29.336 --> 14:30.570
Haley needs me.

14:30.603 --> 14:32.439
She needs me to keep believing
that she's alive.

14:32.472 --> 14:36.109
I'm the one keeping her alive,
the only one.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.980
- I'm sorry.
- Okay, slow down.

14:40.013 --> 14:41.114
- It's okay.

14:41.148 --> 14:43.583
- He just--
he loves her so much.

14:43.616 --> 14:46.686
He loves her more than me,
it seems like, sometimes.

14:46.719 --> 14:52.025
*

14:52.059 --> 14:54.527
- Haley is my life, our life.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.064
She's a beautiful soul,

14:57.097 --> 14:59.499
a--a bright shining star.

14:59.532 --> 15:02.069
There's so much potential,
so much talent.

15:02.102 --> 15:05.138
And look,
if you have any information,

15:05.172 --> 15:07.474
please call the NYPD.

15:07.507 --> 15:10.210
We're offering
a--a $50,000 reward

15:10.243 --> 15:13.546
for any tips leading to
finding our daughter.

15:13.580 --> 15:17.517
And, uh--and, look, Haley--
if--if you can hear me,

15:17.550 --> 15:20.087
if you can see me,

15:20.120 --> 15:21.521
I love you;
we love you so much.

15:21.554 --> 15:24.191
Your mother and I,
we will never, ever

15:24.224 --> 15:26.693
stop looking for you.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.962
All right, thank you.

15:28.996 --> 15:30.097
- The last thing we need is

15:30.130 --> 15:31.398
more crazies calling
the tip line.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.233
- I'll take any tip we can get.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.702
1PP wants answers, guys.
I want answers.

15:35.735 --> 15:37.704
- Well, Vinny was lying
about being asleep all night.

15:37.737 --> 15:40.207
His phone records show he made
two calls to a burner cell:

15:40.240 --> 15:41.741
one at 1:00 A.M.,
the other at 2:20.

15:43.176 --> 15:44.377
- Yeah, they're working
on it right now.

15:44.411 --> 15:46.346
- I've got this:
The license plate reader

15:46.379 --> 15:47.981
got Vinny's Saturn going over
the Manhattan Bridge last night

15:48.015 --> 15:50.984
at 1:38 a.m.
and towards Brooklyn.

15:51.018 --> 15:52.152
- So he also lied about

15:52.185 --> 15:53.586
not leaving his apartment
all night.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.422
- Okay, so find out
where he was going.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.524
Look, have TARU pull footage
from every traffic cam,

15:57.557 --> 15:59.692
every tollbooth reader
in New York State,

15:59.726 --> 16:01.528
if they have to.

16:04.264 --> 16:06.133
- Why you at that
garbage dump, Vinny,

16:06.166 --> 16:09.436
by the water at 2:00 a.m.?
- I can explain.

16:11.371 --> 16:12.772
- No, you think I'd
fit a girl in there?

16:12.805 --> 16:14.274
How

16:14.307 --> 16:15.742
- Cut her up
with a butcher knife.

16:15.775 --> 16:17.344
- God, no.
You're sick.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.012
- Yeah, this is coming
from the same guy

16:19.046 --> 16:21.614
that threatened to kill his
girlfriend with a meat cleaver.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.216
Said he'd cut her head off.

16:23.250 --> 16:24.517
- That was taken
out of context.

16:24.551 --> 16:27.020
- Yeah, yeah,
it's always out of context.

16:27.054 --> 16:28.288
*

16:28.321 --> 16:30.090
This is security footage.

16:30.123 --> 16:32.025
We have a witness
that saw you dragging a bag.

16:32.059 --> 16:34.294
You could barely pick it up--
- It wasn't a girl!

16:34.327 --> 16:36.029
- Meat!

16:37.597 --> 16:39.799
- 80 pounds of brisket,
veal chops, some rib eyes,

16:39.832 --> 16:42.035
pork sausage.

16:42.069 --> 16:45.105
It was past the sell-by date.
My guy's a restaurant supplier.

16:45.138 --> 16:47.640
We meet at
out-of-the-way places.

16:47.674 --> 16:51.578
It's not legal,
but I swear it was meat.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.580
- He was selling rotten meat
out of his trunk.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.115
That's his alibi?

16:55.148 --> 16:56.649
- Well, Drago does work
in a butcher shop.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.285
The boss claims that he doesn't
know anything about it,

16:58.318 --> 17:00.487
but he admits
that it is possible.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.723
- CSU found traces of
pork and beef in his trunk,

17:03.756 --> 17:06.593
along with knives, twine,
and a plastic tarp.

17:06.626 --> 17:09.229
- Sounds like a do-it-yourself
kit for disposing a body.

17:09.262 --> 17:10.497
Who was this buyer?

17:10.530 --> 17:12.732
- Drago only remembers
the first name: Jose.

17:12.765 --> 17:14.401
A black van and a burner phone.

17:14.434 --> 17:17.204
- But it's the same number
that Drago called twice

17:17.237 --> 17:18.605
the night that
Haley disappeared.

17:18.638 --> 17:21.374
- But Jose, the mystery
meat man, is a ghost.

17:21.408 --> 17:23.376
No answer,
can't trace his phone,

17:23.410 --> 17:25.412
and no one else
on the security camera.

17:25.445 --> 17:27.480
- And this supposed transaction
took place at 2:00 a.m.

17:27.514 --> 17:30.083
near a waste disposal facility
in Red Hook, Brooklyn?

17:30.117 --> 17:32.219
- Three hours after
Haley's phone went dead

17:32.252 --> 17:34.121
and she was never
heard from again.

17:34.154 --> 17:36.356
- Send in a search team.

17:42.529 --> 17:44.097
- As soon as we have
something to report,

17:44.131 --> 17:45.298
you'll be the first to know.

17:45.332 --> 17:46.299
- How long will
the search go on?

17:46.333 --> 17:48.468
- As long as it takes.

17:48.501 --> 17:49.636
- Excuse me.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.871
Yeah, we're here, Liv.
We got it covered.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.807
Vincent Drago lawyered up.
He's not cooperating.

17:54.841 --> 17:56.709
- I would too if I were him.

17:56.743 --> 17:59.212
- Detectives, I got bad news.

17:59.246 --> 18:01.514
- Worse.

18:01.548 --> 18:02.782
I just found out that
there was four dumpster

18:02.815 --> 18:04.717
and oil barrel pick-ups
last night at midnight.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.519
- No, no, no, there--
there was supposed to be

18:06.553 --> 18:09.389
nobody in or out
past 5:00 p.m. yesterday.

18:09.422 --> 18:10.690
- There must've been
a shift change.

18:10.723 --> 18:12.559
- Uh, pick-up,
what

18:12.592 --> 18:14.527
- The dumpsters, the barrels,
whatever was in them,

18:14.561 --> 18:16.129
are being trucked to a transfer
station in Jamaica, Queens.

18:16.163 --> 18:17.530
- All right, well,
let's make a call,

18:17.564 --> 18:19.132
let's stop that from happening.
- It's too late.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.400
By now, whatever
hasn't been incinerated

18:20.433 --> 18:21.668
is probably being shipped
out of the state.

18:23.436 --> 18:26.206
- So, you're saying
we may never find Haley?

18:26.239 --> 18:27.907
- We'll keep looking,
but at some point,

18:27.940 --> 18:29.276
someone with
a higher pay grade's

18:29.309 --> 18:30.510
gonna wanna nix the overtime.

18:30.543 --> 18:31.911
- All right,
I'm gonna call Liv.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.446
She's gonna wanna
break it to the parents.

18:33.480 --> 18:34.681
- Are you still
holding out hope?

18:34.714 --> 18:36.283
- I know my daughter's
out there.

18:36.316 --> 18:37.550
- Do you think
she'll be found alive?

18:37.584 --> 18:39.619
It's been three days.
- Too late.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.454
- Leave us alone.
Leave us alone.

18:41.488 --> 18:43.856
- Hey, hey, hey,
Mr. and Mrs. Sadler,

18:43.890 --> 18:45.392
you can't be here, I'm sorry.
- No one's telling us anything.

18:45.425 --> 18:46.726
- I understand that.

18:46.759 --> 18:48.461
- Okay, because we haven't
found anything.

18:48.495 --> 18:49.629
- Well, do you think
that Haley's out there?

18:49.662 --> 18:50.730
- Chris, please.

18:50.763 --> 18:52.399
- No, I wanna help
search, all right?

18:52.432 --> 18:53.666
- Mr. Sadler,
that's not a good idea.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.302
- She's my little girl,
all right?

18:55.335 --> 18:56.369
She's out there! She's alone!
- Okay.

18:56.403 --> 18:58.271
- She's cold! She's afraid!

19:03.376 --> 19:09.416
*

19:09.449 --> 19:10.850
- The search continues tonight

19:10.883 --> 19:13.586
for missing Pennsylvania
teenager, Haley Sadler.

19:13.620 --> 19:16.723
Haley, 16 years old,
vanished without a trace

19:16.756 --> 19:19.626
after partying on
Manhattan's Lower East Side.

19:19.659 --> 19:22.262
Police do have
a suspect in custody:

19:22.295 --> 19:23.863
New York native
Vincent Drago,

19:23.896 --> 19:26.333
who has maintained
his innocence.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.635
- It's been three days, Stone.
- I know.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.537
- Drago, who's been
employed as a butcher

19:30.570 --> 19:31.871
for the past three years

19:31.904 --> 19:33.573
by Balzarini Brothers
in Brooklyn,

19:33.606 --> 19:36.443
remains the NYPD's
prime suspect,

19:36.476 --> 19:37.744
after traces of blood,

19:37.777 --> 19:39.879
which were a DNA match
to Haley,

19:39.912 --> 19:41.348
were found in his apartment...

19:43.616 --> 19:46.219
- It's tough to make
a murder case without a body.

19:46.253 --> 19:47.520
Did Forensics pick up
anything else?

19:47.554 --> 19:49.489
- Nothing.
Hair

19:49.522 --> 19:50.890
- There's nothing.

19:50.923 --> 19:53.493
As far as we can track,
the waste from the site

19:53.526 --> 19:56.529
has already been dispersed
to Virginia, Ohio.

19:56.563 --> 19:58.765
- They can detect
hazardous waste, human blood.

19:58.798 --> 20:01.768
- There's nothing
that's a match to Haley.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.303
- I didn't do it.

20:03.336 --> 20:06.306
They're never
gonna prove I did.

20:06.339 --> 20:07.774
They're never
gonna find a body.

20:07.807 --> 20:10.009
I can tell you that.
- He may be right,

20:10.042 --> 20:12.779
because there were
16 industrial dumpsters.

20:12.812 --> 20:15.648
There were chemical disposal,
waste incinerators,

20:15.682 --> 20:17.517
not to mention
the Gowanus Canal.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.286
- Are you still
holding out hope?

20:19.319 --> 20:20.653
- I know my daughter's
out there.

20:20.687 --> 20:22.389
- Do you think
she'll be found alive?

20:22.422 --> 20:23.656
It's been three days.

20:23.690 --> 20:25.925
- How long are you gonna
torture her parents?

20:25.958 --> 20:27.927
- Are you always
this persistent?

20:27.960 --> 20:29.596
- Wait till you get to know me.

20:29.629 --> 20:31.664
- Haley, born in Beaver Falls,
Pennsylvania,

20:31.698 --> 20:33.666
was discovered
as a musical prodigy

20:33.700 --> 20:36.636
by a pre-school teacher
at three years old.

20:36.669 --> 20:39.406
Her parents, Anna,
a substitute teacher,

20:39.439 --> 20:41.774
and Chris,
a sanitation engineer,

20:41.808 --> 20:44.911
have no musical background,
and were astounded to learn

20:44.944 --> 20:47.013
the depth of
their daughter's talent,

20:47.046 --> 20:49.349
Haley mastered the piano
by four,

20:49.382 --> 20:51.484
becoming an accomplished
pianist,

20:51.518 --> 20:54.554
a virtuoso by five,
and by the age of six

20:54.587 --> 20:57.724
was competing at
international music festivals.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.926
She impressed the music world
by her wins...

20:59.959 --> 21:03.029
- Okay...I'll arraign him
on murder two.

21:03.062 --> 21:04.897
- Do you think
you can get a conviction?

21:04.931 --> 21:06.966
- I'm sure as hell gonna try.

21:10.002 --> 21:11.671
*

21:14.874 --> 21:18.411
*

21:21.814 --> 21:21.948
.

21:21.981 --> 21:22.549
- Haley and I were dancing,

21:24.050 --> 21:25.685
and a guy in a clown mask
grabbed her from behind.

21:25.718 --> 21:27.987
- People's Exhibit Three.

21:30.557 --> 21:32.659
Was this the mask?

21:32.692 --> 21:34.060
- Yes.

21:34.093 --> 21:35.962
- Did you ever get
to see his face?

21:35.995 --> 21:38.665
- No, but he bought us drinks.

21:38.698 --> 21:42.101
I could hear his voice,
and I could see his eyes.

21:42.134 --> 21:44.471
I'll never forget
how creepy they were.

21:44.504 --> 21:46.406
- And do you recognize
the man in the clown mask

21:46.439 --> 21:49.509
in the courtroom today?

21:49.542 --> 21:51.378
It's him.

21:51.411 --> 21:53.346
It's the defendant...

21:53.380 --> 21:55.715
with those same creepy eyes.

21:55.748 --> 21:57.950
- Is there an objection,
Mr. Trozze?

21:57.984 --> 22:00.720
- No, Your Honor.
- Mr. Stone.

22:00.753 --> 22:02.455
- Thank you.

22:02.489 --> 22:05.324
Jenni, when was the last time
you saw your friend, Haley?

22:06.926 --> 22:09.796
- She was dancing
with the defendant...

22:10.963 --> 22:13.800
And then I never saw her again
after that.

22:15.635 --> 22:18.371
- Thank you.

22:18.405 --> 22:19.906
No more questions.

22:22.074 --> 22:24.110
- No questions, Your Honor.

22:24.143 --> 22:27.780
*

22:27.814 --> 22:29.782
- Haley never even had
a boyfriend.

22:30.950 --> 22:34.086
She was at that in-between age.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.988
You know...

22:36.022 --> 22:39.392
she had crushes, but, uh...

22:39.426 --> 22:40.660
music was her life.

22:40.693 --> 22:44.731
- Oh, she was a prodigy, yeah.

22:44.764 --> 22:46.098
*

22:46.132 --> 22:49.135
Beethoven was her--
was her first language.

22:49.168 --> 22:50.336
*

22:50.369 --> 22:53.072
She started winning top prizes
at international festivals

22:53.105 --> 22:55.575
when she was six years old.

22:57.510 --> 23:01.614
She--she--she was
a finalist at the--

23:01.648 --> 23:05.818
the Cliburn Junior
Piano Competition at 10.

23:05.852 --> 23:07.153
She was gonna be somebody,

23:07.186 --> 23:09.021
you know,
not like me and her mom,

23:09.055 --> 23:12.925
living--living our whole lives
in a--in a--in a small town.

23:12.959 --> 23:14.126
- How would you describe

23:14.160 --> 23:16.629
your relationship
with your daughter?

23:16.663 --> 23:18.631
- We butted heads sometimes.

23:18.665 --> 23:20.767
You know,
she'd tease me about my--

23:20.800 --> 23:22.201
about my fingernails
being dirty,

23:22.234 --> 23:25.171
about--about me being
a--a garbage man,

23:25.204 --> 23:28.207
but I loved her.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.976
We loved her,

23:30.009 --> 23:32.612
my wife and I,
from the bottom of our hearts.

23:32.645 --> 23:34.847
I'm sorry, it's very difficult
for me to talk about her.

23:34.881 --> 23:37.016
- No, no, I understand.

23:37.049 --> 23:39.185
Just one more question...

23:39.218 --> 23:40.252
*

23:40.286 --> 23:44.491
The defense is claiming
that your daughter ran away.

23:44.524 --> 23:47.794
Do you think that's possible?
- Absolutely not.

23:47.827 --> 23:49.529
No, she was--she was--
she was happy.

23:49.562 --> 23:52.599
She was--she was well-adjusted.
Never had any problems.

23:52.632 --> 23:54.967
She would--she would never
do anything like that,

23:55.001 --> 23:57.670
not to her mother, not to me.

23:57.704 --> 23:59.972
- Thank you.

24:00.006 --> 24:03.075
No more questions.

24:03.109 --> 24:04.611
- Nothing for this witness.

24:04.644 --> 24:08.080
No disrespect, but...
they don't have a body.

24:11.250 --> 24:12.552
*

24:15.588 --> 24:17.790
- Yeah.
- We're worried about the case.

24:17.824 --> 24:19.692
What the defense attorney
said is....

24:19.726 --> 24:21.227
- Oh, he's just doing his job.

24:21.260 --> 24:23.162
- Uh, maybe we should
postpone the trial

24:23.195 --> 24:25.865
until we find Haley's body.

24:25.898 --> 24:27.967
- I'm sorry,
it's too late for that.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.602
- But if Vincent Drago's
found not guilty,

24:29.636 --> 24:30.837
he can't be tried again.

24:30.870 --> 24:32.939
- I believe we can get
a conviction.

24:32.972 --> 24:34.874
With you talking about Haley,

24:34.907 --> 24:37.844
I could see that
the jury was moved.

24:37.877 --> 24:39.546
And when we put you
on the witness stand,

24:39.579 --> 24:41.948
I'll introduce the video
that Haley sent you.

24:41.981 --> 24:44.951
It's the strongest piece
of evidence we have.

24:44.984 --> 24:47.587
When the jury sees her face

24:47.620 --> 24:49.656
and hears her voice...

24:49.689 --> 24:51.891
I'm asking you to trust me.

24:51.924 --> 24:53.726
- Okay.

24:53.760 --> 24:55.695
- Go back to the hotel.

24:55.728 --> 24:59.031
Get some food, get some sleep.
I'll see you bright and early.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.674
- It's day two of
the Haley Sadler murder trial,

25:07.707 --> 25:10.910
and more prosecution witnesses
are expected to testify today

25:10.943 --> 25:14.146
about their last communication
with the missing teen.

25:14.180 --> 25:15.882
Without Haley's remains,

25:15.915 --> 25:18.685
and what experts are calling
thin forensic evidence,

25:18.718 --> 25:21.888
the pressure is mounting
for the DA's office.

25:21.921 --> 25:23.623
- Stone's got this.
- I don't know,

25:23.656 --> 25:25.057
I heard this defense attorney's
pretty cocky.

25:25.091 --> 25:26.759
No body, no case.
- I just don't see

25:26.793 --> 25:28.628
how Haley's parents are
making it through this,

25:28.661 --> 25:30.296
sitting in that courtroom
all day, every day...

25:30.329 --> 25:34.200
- Waiting for closure
that they...may never get.

25:36.002 --> 25:37.637
I thought you were in court.

25:37.670 --> 25:39.639
- My first witness,
James Turner, the chaperone,

25:39.672 --> 25:41.808
was a no-show.

25:41.841 --> 25:42.909
- No, he checked out
last night.

25:42.942 --> 25:44.243
He's not answering his cell.

25:44.276 --> 25:45.978
I called his wife.
She said last time they spoke,

25:46.012 --> 25:47.714
he was nervous
about testifying.

25:48.981 --> 25:50.617
- I sent local PD
to sit on his house.

25:50.650 --> 25:52.018
The wife won't let them in.
I could get a warrant.

25:52.051 --> 25:53.319
- That could take all day.

25:53.352 --> 25:55.054
- I mean, Beaver Falls
is six hours away.

25:55.087 --> 25:56.255
- The way you drive,
we can make that in four.

25:56.288 --> 25:57.323
- Go now.

25:57.356 --> 25:59.325
- I'll give Highway Patrol
a heads up.

25:59.358 --> 26:01.327
- Okay.

26:01.360 --> 26:04.330
What now?

26:04.363 --> 26:07.834
- Now I go beg the judge
for a continuance.

26:07.867 --> 26:09.201
- Well, I hope you're not sorry

26:09.235 --> 26:12.972
that I talked you into
taking this to trial.

26:13.005 --> 26:14.774
- Not yet.

26:14.807 --> 26:17.309
*

26:20.913 --> 26:21.047
.

26:21.080 --> 26:21.881
- So, your husband isn't home,
Mrs. Turner?

26:23.415 --> 26:24.851
- No, I've been telling
the cops that.

26:24.884 --> 26:26.018
Is James in
some kind of trouble

26:26.052 --> 26:27.353
because Haley was killed?

26:27.386 --> 26:28.721
- Well, he was supposed to
testify this morning.

26:28.755 --> 26:30.289
He didn't show up to court,
so yeah.

26:30.322 --> 26:32.859
- He and Haley were very close.
He was crying on the phone.

26:32.892 --> 26:34.393
- When's the last time
you spoke with him?

26:34.426 --> 26:35.928
- Last night.

26:35.962 --> 26:38.765
Do I--do I need to be
worried about James?

26:38.798 --> 26:40.166
- Sometimes, testifying
can be stressful.

26:40.199 --> 26:41.834
Maybe he went somewhere
to clear his head?

26:41.868 --> 26:43.369
- Yeah, maybe you could
call him again.

26:43.402 --> 26:44.837
Look, we drove all the way
from New York.

26:44.871 --> 26:47.640
This is important.

26:49.709 --> 26:50.943
Straight to voicemail.

26:50.977 --> 26:52.879
- Okay, well,
thanks for trying.

26:52.912 --> 26:55.648
- James talked non-stop
about Haley.

26:55.682 --> 26:57.116
It drove me crazy,

26:57.149 --> 27:00.219
but now that she's dead, it's--

27:00.252 --> 27:01.654
what a tragedy.

27:01.688 --> 27:02.822
- Wh--what would he say
about her?

27:02.855 --> 27:05.191
- He'd go on and on
about her talent,

27:05.224 --> 27:07.226
how she was a genius
on the piano.

27:07.259 --> 27:09.662
James loves all his students,

27:09.696 --> 27:11.097
maybe because
we don't have kids,

27:11.130 --> 27:14.000
but he really doted on Haley.

27:14.033 --> 27:15.902
- Did they spend
a lot of time together?

27:15.935 --> 27:17.236
- Yes, they went to concerts.

27:17.269 --> 27:18.838
He went to
all her competitions.

27:18.871 --> 27:20.773
- Mm-hmm.
- James would invite me along,

27:20.807 --> 27:24.310
but I'm just really
not much for music.

27:24.343 --> 27:27.413
Haley was sweet,
the one time we met.

27:27.446 --> 27:29.716
- About a month ago.

27:29.749 --> 27:32.084
She came by to borrow
some of his sound equipment.

27:32.118 --> 27:34.854
They were in the studio
for hours.

27:34.887 --> 27:37.223
- You have a recording studio
in your house?

27:37.256 --> 27:39.258
- Yeah.

27:42.294 --> 27:49.702
*

27:55.241 --> 27:57.977
- Turner's prolific; there's
a ton of compositions here.

27:58.010 --> 28:01.047
Writing music together?

28:01.080 --> 28:02.815
- Yeah, maybe.

28:02.849 --> 28:04.984
Hey, look at this.

28:05.017 --> 28:07.253
"Haley's Song: Music and
Lyrics by James Turner."

28:07.286 --> 28:11.991
- Okay, so maybe it was just a
a mentor-student relationship.

28:12.024 --> 28:13.325
- Maybe not.

28:16.362 --> 28:18.130
*

28:18.164 --> 28:19.465
Oh...

28:19.498 --> 28:25.404
*

28:25.437 --> 28:27.974
Okay then.

28:28.007 --> 28:31.243
I'm calling Liv.
- Yeah.

28:31.277 --> 28:33.279
- "What a surprise.

28:33.312 --> 28:37.016
"My Haley,
you came through my door.

28:37.049 --> 28:40.152
The beautiful body
I l--longed for was yours."

28:40.186 --> 28:41.954
What the hell was this guy
doing with my daughter?

28:41.988 --> 28:44.156
- Well, that's what we're
trying to find out.

28:44.190 --> 28:46.793
What do you know about
their relationship?

28:46.826 --> 28:49.762
- There--there is
no relationship.

28:49.796 --> 28:53.265
He was her music teacher
for years. That's all.

28:53.299 --> 28:57.436
- Look, I know that
this is a lot to process.

28:57.469 --> 28:59.939
We need to find
James Turner now.

28:59.972 --> 29:01.507
- So you--you think
he killed her?

29:01.540 --> 29:03.442
- We don't know
what we're looking at.

29:03.475 --> 29:07.379
- Look, you two have spent a
lot of time together recently.

29:07.413 --> 29:09.015
Has he said anything

29:09.048 --> 29:12.919
that now you think is
odd or strange?

29:12.952 --> 29:15.321
- No, I mean--you know, he--
he--he was upset about Haley.

29:15.354 --> 29:18.390
He seemed to b--to be as upset
as we were, I thought.

29:18.424 --> 29:20.426
- Did he mention
any friends in the city?

29:20.459 --> 29:21.928
- He--he doesn't know
anyone here.

29:21.961 --> 29:23.796
He's lived in Beaver Falls
for 20 years.

29:23.830 --> 29:24.997
- No, what about
that night last week

29:25.031 --> 29:26.232
we went out for a bite?

29:26.265 --> 29:27.800
We ran into this guy
about James' age.

29:27.834 --> 29:29.201
They seemed to go way back.

29:30.502 --> 29:32.338
- Yeah, uh--uh--uh,
Alan--Alan-something.

29:32.371 --> 29:33.906
- Hube--Hubert.
- Hubert!

29:33.940 --> 29:36.342
Yeah, Al--Alan Hubert,
and--and I guess these guys,

29:36.375 --> 29:37.977
you know, they wrote
a commercial jingle together.

29:38.010 --> 29:39.912
This Hubert guy
was full of himself.

29:39.946 --> 29:41.814
Wouldn't stop talking about
how the--the royalties

29:41.848 --> 29:44.116
paid for his mansion
on Long Island.

29:48.988 --> 29:51.057
- It's "Hu-bear."

29:51.090 --> 29:53.192
- Well, I'm Detective Carisi;
this is Detective Rollins.

29:53.225 --> 29:54.193
We're with SVU.

29:54.226 --> 29:55.962
- Yes, my assistant said
you were looking for me.

29:57.997 --> 30:00.299
- Co-wrote a dog food jingle
with him years ago.

30:00.332 --> 30:02.201
I should tell you,
one, I've been up all night

30:02.234 --> 30:04.103
and two, I'm late for
a meeting with Lin-Manuel.

30:04.136 --> 30:05.905
- We need to find
where Turner is right now.

30:05.938 --> 30:07.373
Whatever for?
- We think he may have

30:07.406 --> 30:10.076
something to do with Haley
Sadler's disappearance.

30:10.109 --> 30:12.912
- Can't say I'm shocked.

30:12.945 --> 30:15.982
- The man's a loser, a hack.

30:16.015 --> 30:19.185
Claims I stole his lyrics.
They were all mine.

30:19.218 --> 30:21.487
Look at my resume,
for God's sakes.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.055
My reputation
speaks for itself.

30:23.089 --> 30:25.157
And Turner?
What has he been reduced to?

30:25.191 --> 30:27.159
He's teaching high school
in Beaver Falls.

30:27.193 --> 30:29.128
- Yeah, Alan, do you have
any idea where he might be?

30:29.161 --> 30:30.863
- I'm not gonna be
implicated in this.

30:30.897 --> 30:32.131
- Hey, you're not
going anywhere

30:32.164 --> 30:34.533
until you tell us
where James Turner is.

30:34.566 --> 30:36.869
- Okay...he called me

30:36.903 --> 30:39.471
before he came to New York
on this school trip.

30:39.505 --> 30:41.507
He was begging and crying.

30:41.540 --> 30:43.209
Said he was having
marriage troubles,

30:43.242 --> 30:44.010
needed a place to stay.

30:44.043 --> 30:46.478
He knew I had a house
in Oyster Bay.

30:46.512 --> 30:48.247
He doesn't have
any other friends.

30:48.280 --> 30:50.282
He pressured me,
I felt sorry for him,

30:50.316 --> 30:52.118
I stupidly gave him the key,

30:52.151 --> 30:54.553
but I haven't
heard from him since.

31:00.692 --> 31:02.261
- Not a bad place
to hide from the cops.

31:02.294 --> 31:04.430
- Yeah, I need better friends.
- Lights are off.

31:04.463 --> 31:06.498
- Hopefully he's still asleep.

31:06.532 --> 31:13.205
*

31:13.239 --> 31:15.441
James Turner?
- Yeah, in there.

31:15.474 --> 31:19.912
*

31:19.946 --> 31:21.313
Huh?

31:21.347 --> 31:23.149
- Get away from the girl!
- Haley...

31:23.182 --> 31:25.284
- Move! Move!

31:25.317 --> 31:27.153
- Listen, I'm here
to help you, okay?

31:27.186 --> 31:28.988
You're all right.
You're safe now.

31:29.021 --> 31:30.022
- It's not what it looks like.
- Okay, you're all right.

31:30.056 --> 31:31.590
- Go away! Leave us alone!

31:31.623 --> 31:33.425
I love him.

31:37.396 --> 31:38.697
- Come on.
- Okay.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.532
- James!
- It's gonna be all right.

31:40.566 --> 31:42.301
- Come on.

31:42.334 --> 31:49.008
*

31:52.444 --> 31:52.611
.

31:52.644 --> 31:53.345
- James didn't do
anything wrong.

31:55.047 --> 31:56.315
I don't want him
to go to jail--

31:56.348 --> 31:58.617
- You're 16, he's 40.
That's a crime.

31:58.650 --> 32:01.720
Okay, he--he kidnapped you.
He framed an innocent person.

32:01.753 --> 32:04.190
- No, that wasn't him.
That was my idea.

32:04.223 --> 32:06.058
I cut myself.

32:06.092 --> 32:08.194
I left the blood.
I sent that video.

32:08.227 --> 32:10.662
- Haley...

32:10.696 --> 32:13.399
Vincent Drago
could've gone to jail.

32:13.432 --> 32:15.334
- I never meant
for that to happen.

32:15.367 --> 32:17.036
I just wanted him
to look suspicious.

32:17.069 --> 32:20.206
I met him at the club.
He--he seemed like a criminal.

32:20.239 --> 32:22.174
- Well, you lucked out
on that one.

32:22.208 --> 32:24.643
- James said that
we were gonna hang out

32:24.676 --> 32:26.245
until everybody assumed
that I was dead,

32:26.278 --> 32:27.513
that I'd never be found.

32:29.781 --> 32:32.451
- We were going to Vienna.

32:32.484 --> 32:35.254
James was gonna buy me
a Steinway Grand.

32:35.287 --> 32:38.357
He'd compose sonatas
for me to play.

32:38.390 --> 32:41.593
We were going to tour
the world together.

32:41.627 --> 32:43.229
I love him.

32:43.262 --> 32:44.730
- I love her.

32:44.763 --> 32:47.733
How is that wrong?
- She's 16, dude.

32:47.766 --> 32:50.469
- She has an old soul.
- Yeah, tell that to the judge.

32:50.502 --> 32:51.770
- Yeah, tell it
to her old man too.

32:51.803 --> 32:53.772
Chris could never understand.

32:53.805 --> 32:57.509
- Because most people
don't understand child rape.

32:57.543 --> 32:59.245
- You don't have
to be so crude.

32:59.278 --> 33:01.113
What would you call it?

33:01.147 --> 33:03.582
- A fugue for two voices.

33:03.615 --> 33:07.053
A soprano and a tenor,
fitting together perfectly.

33:09.155 --> 33:12.124
- Haley, he abused your trust.

33:12.158 --> 33:14.326
Okay? He raped you.

33:14.360 --> 33:16.262
- No, no, it was not like that.

33:16.295 --> 33:19.431
He taught me about music,
about love.

33:19.465 --> 33:21.067
- As a teacher,

33:21.100 --> 33:23.569
you always dream of
that one special student...

33:23.602 --> 33:25.171
- What, to jump into bed
with 'em?

33:25.204 --> 33:26.605
- Who could teach you.

33:26.638 --> 33:30.409
- James is bigger
than Beaver Falls.

33:30.442 --> 33:32.244
He actually knows
the difference between

33:32.278 --> 33:34.280
a sonata and a concerto.

33:34.313 --> 33:38.384
- Music brought us places
I'd never been.

33:38.417 --> 33:40.486
- You think I don't know
about love.

33:42.488 --> 33:44.823
I know all about love.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.826
*

33:47.859 --> 33:50.562
- Here.
Be careful, it's hot.

33:52.331 --> 33:54.166
James was her teacher.

33:54.200 --> 33:57.169
He took Haley and let us
think she was dead?

33:57.203 --> 33:59.505
- All right, but she's alive,
Anna, okay? She's alive.

33:59.538 --> 34:01.440
I mean, this whole time,
we thought she was

34:01.473 --> 34:02.708
chopped up in a landfill
somewhere.

34:02.741 --> 34:04.376
She's alive.
She's okay, right?

34:04.410 --> 34:06.678
- She's not
physically hurt, no.

34:08.147 --> 34:10.449
- Did he--did--did--
- Of course he did.

34:10.482 --> 34:12.584
That son of a bitch,
of course he did!

34:12.618 --> 34:14.486
- Listen, uh,
Mr. and Mrs. Sadler,

34:14.520 --> 34:16.088
I'd like you to have a seat
right here,

34:16.122 --> 34:17.856
and I'll be back in a moment
with your daughter.

34:17.889 --> 34:21.360
- I'll kill him.
- Please, Mrs. Sadler...

34:21.393 --> 34:23.729
I don't wanna lock you up too.

34:23.762 --> 34:26.398
Have a seat.

34:29.568 --> 34:32.671
- He confessed to everything.
- You're kidding me.

34:32.704 --> 34:34.573
- He said he did it all
for love.

34:34.606 --> 34:36.475
Oh, my God.

34:36.508 --> 34:39.077
- Mr. and Mrs. Sadler...
- Please...

34:40.246 --> 34:42.748
- Take this guy to holding...

34:42.781 --> 34:44.750
Haley...

34:44.783 --> 34:46.885
- James...

34:46.918 --> 34:49.855
- Leave him alone!
- Take it easy.

34:49.888 --> 34:52.324
- We love each other!
- Let's get you out of here.

34:52.358 --> 34:54.193
- Out of all the girls
in the school...

34:54.226 --> 34:56.662
- Haley, listen to me,
he's a grown man,

34:56.695 --> 34:58.464
and you are a teenager, okay?

34:58.497 --> 35:01.500
He wasn't thinking about you.
He was thinking about himself.

35:01.533 --> 35:03.902
- You stupid--
- I love her.

35:03.935 --> 35:05.671
- I bet you fed her
that nonsense

35:05.704 --> 35:07.773
about the fugue and two voices.

35:07.806 --> 35:09.708
Works every time,
doesn't it, Jimmy?

35:09.741 --> 35:12.311
That and a few glasses
of chardonnay.

35:12.344 --> 35:13.612
- Anna, stop.

35:13.645 --> 35:17.349
- How many seductions
is enough, huh?

35:17.383 --> 35:19.585
- This was different.

35:19.618 --> 35:21.353
This was real.

35:24.490 --> 35:27.259
*

35:27.293 --> 35:29.361
- We slept together...

35:29.395 --> 35:31.197
*

35:31.230 --> 35:34.166
James and me.

35:34.200 --> 35:36.302
It was one time,

35:36.335 --> 35:38.270
one time...

35:38.304 --> 35:40.306
17 years ago.

35:40.339 --> 35:42.474
*

35:42.508 --> 35:45.777
- Anna...

35:45.811 --> 35:48.180
Yeah, it's real.

35:48.214 --> 35:49.581
Do the math.

35:49.615 --> 35:51.583
*

35:51.617 --> 35:53.952
That's right, Jimmy.

35:53.985 --> 35:55.721
She's yours.

35:55.754 --> 35:59.558
You've been sleeping
with your own daughter!

35:59.591 --> 36:02.561
*

36:05.297 --> 36:07.533
- How many years does he get
for incest, Lieutenant?

36:07.566 --> 36:09.201
- Oh, my God.

36:09.235 --> 36:11.370
- Anna...

36:11.403 --> 36:12.971
you knew this whole time?

36:13.004 --> 36:15.574
- I couldn't tell you.

36:15.607 --> 36:18.577
And then, we thought
Haley was dead.

36:18.610 --> 36:21.613
Wh

36:21.647 --> 36:23.649
*

36:23.682 --> 36:26.952
- Chris, I didn't know.

36:26.985 --> 36:28.754
I swear.
- Shut up!

36:28.787 --> 36:30.589
Shut up, you stupid
son of a bitch!

36:30.622 --> 36:31.790
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

36:31.823 --> 36:33.725
- Just give me
five minutes alone

36:33.759 --> 36:36.462
with this scumbag in a cell!
Just five minutes!

36:36.495 --> 36:37.729
- That's not gonna happen,
Mr. Sadler.

36:37.763 --> 36:39.498
- Help!

36:42.668 --> 36:45.404
- Hey--

36:45.437 --> 36:47.406
- This way.

36:49.308 --> 36:53.712
*

36:56.315 --> 36:59.685
Haley...

36:59.718 --> 37:02.488
- James is my real father.

37:02.521 --> 37:04.756
It makes perfect sense.

37:04.790 --> 37:07.693
- I've always felt
this connection.

37:07.726 --> 37:11.463
We both love music and art.
We're alike.

37:11.497 --> 37:14.900
I played the Hammerklavier
when I was 12.

37:14.933 --> 37:19.371
I knew my father
couldn't be a garbage man.

37:19.405 --> 37:21.407
I just knew it.

37:24.443 --> 37:30.816
*

37:30.849 --> 37:34.486
- Turner plead guilty
to rape two, kidnapping,

37:34.520 --> 37:36.522
endangering a minor,
and incest.

37:36.555 --> 37:38.557
- Well...
- He's on suicide watch.

37:38.590 --> 37:39.925
He had no idea
Haley was his daughter?

37:39.958 --> 37:43.429
- No, he didn't,
and neither did Haley.

37:43.462 --> 37:44.796
- So, how--

37:44.830 --> 37:47.833
- It's called
genetic sexual attraction.

37:47.866 --> 37:50.001
When a father and daughter

37:50.035 --> 37:52.804
don't grow up
in the same household,

37:52.838 --> 37:55.941
and then they meet as adults...

37:55.974 --> 37:57.776
it can happen.

37:59.077 --> 38:01.447
- You recommend
the best therapist you know,

38:01.480 --> 38:05.584
and you...pray to God
that they can work through it.

38:06.752 --> 38:09.421
- Fathers and daughters...

38:09.455 --> 38:10.889
Fathers and sons.

38:10.922 --> 38:13.425
There are times I wish
my father was someone else.

38:13.459 --> 38:15.994
- Yeah.

38:16.027 --> 38:18.997
Well...

38:19.030 --> 38:20.966
Look, I hope this
doesn't put you

38:20.999 --> 38:23.369
on the next train
back to Chicago.

38:23.402 --> 38:25.404
- I made someone a promise.

38:28.607 --> 38:31.543
- Actually, my sister, Pamela.

38:31.577 --> 38:33.712
She's in a facility upstate.

38:33.745 --> 38:35.481
*

38:35.514 --> 38:38.584
She has schizophrenia.

38:38.617 --> 38:40.085
- I'm so sorry.

38:40.118 --> 38:42.020
*

38:42.053 --> 38:45.557
Our father used to
visit her once a week.

38:45.591 --> 38:48.059
Now that's on me.

38:48.093 --> 38:51.129
- That's a lot.

38:51.162 --> 38:54.900
Look, if you, uh--

38:54.933 --> 38:57.102
if you ever feel
like talking...

38:57.135 --> 39:04.376
*

39:19.425 --> 39:22.661
Pam?
- Hi.

39:24.596 --> 39:27.032
Who are you?

39:27.065 --> 39:28.700
