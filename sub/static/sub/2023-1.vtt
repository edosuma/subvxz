03:54.000 --> 03:57.665
Why not call it
the Big Chill or the Nippy era?

03:57.753 --> 04:00.790
I'm just sayin',
how do we know it's an Ice age?

04:00.881 --> 04:03.586
Because of all the ice.

04:06.053 --> 04:08.543
Well, things just got a little chillier.

04:08.638 --> 04:12.221
Help. Help.

04:12.308 --> 04:15.642
Come on, kids, let's go. The traffic's movin'.

04:15.978 --> 04:18.017
But, but, but, Dad.

04:18.147 --> 04:20.898
No buts. You can play extinction later.

04:21.233 --> 04:24.649
OK. Come on, guys.

04:24.903 --> 04:26.979
So, where's Eddie?

04:27.072 --> 04:30.855
He said he was on the verge
of an evolutionary breakthrough.

04:30.950 --> 04:33.026
Really?

04:33.536 --> 04:36.205
I'm flying.

04:37.498 --> 04:39.656
Some breakthrough.

04:40.793 --> 04:43.330
- Look out.
- You're going the wrong way.

04:44.337 --> 04:46.413
Crazy mammoth.

04:53.220 --> 04:57.929
Do the world a favour.
Move your issues off the road.

04:58.308 --> 05:02.555
If my trunk was that small,
I wouldn't draw attention to myself, pal.

05:02.729 --> 05:06.347
Give me a break.
We've been waddlin' all day.

05:08.151 --> 05:10.902
Go ahead. Follow the crowd.

05:10.987 --> 05:13.228
It'll be quieter when you're gone.

05:14.532 --> 05:17.366
Come on. If he wants to
freeze to death, let him.

05:27.418 --> 05:29.494
I'm up. I'm up.

05:31.922 --> 05:37.260
Rise and shine, everybody.
Huh? Zak? Marshall?

05:37.344 --> 05:40.095
Bertie? Uncle Fungus?

05:40.722 --> 05:46.926
Where is everybody? Come on, guys,
we're gonna miss the migration.

05:49.563 --> 05:53.892
They left without me.
They do this every year.

05:55.902 --> 05:58.903
Why? Doesn't anyone love me?

05:59.280 --> 06:03.657
Isn't there anyone who cares
about Sid the Sloth?

06:06.329 --> 06:08.487
All right, I'll just go by myself.

06:11.083 --> 06:12.743
Sick.

06:12.834 --> 06:15.586
Wide body, kerb it next time.

06:15.670 --> 06:18.161
Oh, jeez. Yuck.

06:18.423 --> 06:24.046
I can't believe it. Fresh wild greens.
Frank, where did you ever...?

06:24.136 --> 06:27.303
- Go ahead. Dig in.
- A dandelion.

06:27.389 --> 06:30.972
- I thought the frost wiped 'em all out.
- All but one.

06:32.394 --> 06:36.226
It makes me so... I wanna... Yuck.

06:36.314 --> 06:41.059
This has definitely not been my day.
You know what I'm sayin', buddy?

06:41.152 --> 06:44.936
What a mess. You rhinos
have tiny brains. Did you know that?

06:45.030 --> 06:50.025
It's just a fact. No offence. You probably
didn't even know what I'm talkin' about.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.155
Yummo.

06:52.370 --> 06:55.324
A dandelion. Must be
the last one of the season.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.790
- Carl.
- Easy, Frank.

07:00.878 --> 07:02.954
He ruined our salad.

07:04.340 --> 07:07.127
My mistake. That was my mistake. Let me...

07:07.676 --> 07:11.508
No, no, seriously, let me
take care of this. What is this?

07:11.596 --> 07:15.261
Pine cones. Oh, my goodness.
They're my favourite.

07:17.143 --> 07:21.639
Delicious. That's good eating.

07:21.897 --> 07:25.266
But don't let me hog them all up.
Here, you have some.

07:25.359 --> 07:28.146
<i>Tasty, isn't it? Bon appêtit.</i>

07:29.487 --> 07:31.646
Now?

07:32.115 --> 07:34.191
Now.

07:43.083 --> 07:47.127
- Just pretend that I'm not here.
- I wanted to hit him at full speed.

07:47.212 --> 07:52.502
- That's OK. We'll have some fun with him.
- Don't let them impale me. I wanna live.

07:52.592 --> 07:55.925
- Get off me.
- Come on, you're makin' a scene.

07:56.012 --> 07:58.798
<i>We'll just take our furry piñata and go.</i>

07:58.889 --> 08:01.890
If it's not them today,
it's someone else tomorrow.

08:01.975 --> 08:04.383
Well, I'd rather it not be today. OK?

08:04.478 --> 08:07.846
We'll break your neck
so you don't feel a thing.

08:07.939 --> 08:11.059
Wait a minute. I thought
rhinos were vegetarians.

08:11.192 --> 08:13.268
- An excellent point.
- Shut up.

08:13.361 --> 08:17.025
Who says we're gonna eat him
after we kill him?

08:17.114 --> 08:20.031
I don't like animals that kill for pleasure.

08:20.117 --> 08:23.532
- Save it for a mammal that cares.
- I'm a mammal that cares.

08:23.787 --> 08:28.911
OK, if either of you make it across that
sinkhole in front of ya, you get the sloth.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.866
That's right, you losers.
You take one step and you're dead.

08:37.091 --> 08:40.673
- You were bluffing, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah, that was a bluff.

08:41.845 --> 08:43.587
Get him.

09:19.629 --> 09:21.705
A dandelion?

09:24.550 --> 09:26.626
We did it.

09:35.102 --> 09:38.885
- You have beautiful eyes.
- Get off my face.

09:40.106 --> 09:44.186
Whoa, we make a great team.
What do you say we head south together?

09:44.277 --> 09:46.767
Great. Jump on my back
and relax the whole way.

09:46.862 --> 09:48.902
- Wow, really?
- No.

09:49.156 --> 09:53.485
Wait, aren't you going south?
The change of seasons, migration instincts.

09:53.577 --> 09:56.328
- Any of this a-ringin' a bell?
- I guess not. Bye.

09:56.413 --> 09:59.330
OK, then. Thanks for the help.
I can take it from here.

10:00.291 --> 10:04.075
You overgrown weasel.
Wait till we get down there.

10:04.837 --> 10:08.621
That south thing is way overrated.
The heat, the crowds - who needs it?

10:08.715 --> 10:13.294
Isn't this great? You and me,
two bachelors knockin' about in the wild.

10:13.386 --> 10:17.218
No, you just want a bodyguard
so you don't become somebody's side dish.

10:17.307 --> 10:19.632
You're a very shrewd mammal.

10:19.725 --> 10:22.679
OK, lead the way, Mr Big...
Didn't get the name.

10:22.770 --> 10:24.809
- Manfred.
- Manfred? Yuck.

10:24.897 --> 10:30.104
How about Manny the Moody Mammoth?
Or Manny the Melancholy... Manny the...

10:32.612 --> 10:34.688
Stop following me.

10:36.366 --> 10:42.201
OK, so you've got issues. You won't
even know I'm here. I'll just zip the lip.

11:26.244 --> 11:30.194
Look at the cute little baby, Diego.

11:32.583 --> 11:38.004
- Isn't it nice he'll be joining us for breakfast?
- It wouldn't be breakfast without him.

11:38.088 --> 11:43.877
Especially since his daddy wiped out half
our pack and wears our skin to keep warm.

11:43.969 --> 11:47.088
An eye for an eye, don't you think?

11:47.180 --> 11:50.762
Let's show him what happens
when he messes with sabres.

11:50.850 --> 11:54.016
Alert the troops. We attack at dawn.

11:55.062 --> 11:59.688
And, Diego, bring me that baby alive.

11:59.775 --> 12:05.065
If I'm gonna enjoy my revenge,
I want it to be fresh.

12:26.466 --> 12:28.624
Phew. I'm wiped out.

12:29.010 --> 12:32.627
- That's your shelter?
- You're a big guy. You got a lotta wood.

12:32.721 --> 12:35.508
- I'm a little guy.
- You got half a stick.

12:35.599 --> 12:41.968
But with my little stick and my highly
evolved brain, I shall create fire.

12:42.397 --> 12:44.188
Fascinating.

12:44.524 --> 12:48.603
We'll see if brains triumph
over brawn tonight. Now, won't we?

12:54.616 --> 12:56.822
Think I saw a spark.

13:00.747 --> 13:04.365
Any chance I could squeeze
in there with you, Manny, ol' pal?

13:04.458 --> 13:06.996
Isn't there someone else you can annoy?

13:07.086 --> 13:10.620
Friends? Family? Poisonous reptiles?

13:11.006 --> 13:15.715
My family abandoned me.
They just kinda migrated without me.

13:15.802 --> 13:18.423
You should see what they did last year.

13:18.513 --> 13:21.264
They woke up early and
tied my hands and feet

13:21.349 --> 13:24.136
and they gagged me with a field mouse,

13:24.226 --> 13:27.844
covered their tracks, went
through water so I'd lose their scent,

13:27.938 --> 13:30.773
and... who needs 'em, anyway?

13:35.320 --> 13:37.645
So what about you? You have family?

13:41.867 --> 13:45.034
OK, you're tired. I see.
We'll talk more in the morning.

13:47.581 --> 13:51.115
Manfred? Manfred?
Could you scooch over a drop?

13:52.169 --> 13:55.288
Come on. Nobody falls asleep that fast.

13:55.380 --> 13:57.456
Manny.

16:48.287 --> 16:50.445
There's Diego. Fall back.

16:57.003 --> 16:59.873
- Where's the baby?
- I lost it over the falls.

17:00.089 --> 17:02.627
You lost it?

17:05.511 --> 17:08.084
- I want that baby, Diego.
- I'll get it.

17:08.180 --> 17:11.845
You'd better, unless you want to
serve as a replacement.

17:12.017 --> 17:15.301
We'll go up to Half Peak. Meet us there.

17:16.688 --> 17:18.763
It had better be alive.

17:20.066 --> 17:22.557
Can we trust you with that, Diego?

17:22.651 --> 17:25.142
Let's go.

17:47.924 --> 17:51.922
She picked a hair off my shoulder and says,
"If you have an extra mating dance,

17:52.011 --> 17:54.585
at least pick a female
with the same colour pelt. "

17:54.764 --> 17:58.180
I thought "Whoa. She's gonna go
praying mantis on me. "

17:58.267 --> 18:02.015
If you find a mate, you should be loyal.
In your case, grateful.

18:02.104 --> 18:05.389
- Now get away from me.
- I think mating for life is stupid.

18:05.482 --> 18:07.724
There's plenty of Sid to go around.

18:09.235 --> 18:11.358
Manny?

18:11.946 --> 18:14.022
Manny?

19:06.829 --> 19:09.367
Look at that. He's OK.

19:21.635 --> 19:24.304
She's gone.

19:34.104 --> 19:37.520
- Manny, are you forgetting something?
- No.

19:37.649 --> 19:41.693
- But you just saved him.
- I'm trying to get rid of the last thing I saved.

19:41.778 --> 19:44.269
But you can't leave him here.

19:48.284 --> 19:51.818
Look, there's smoke.
That's his herd right up the hill.

19:52.079 --> 19:56.028
- We should return him.
- Let's get this straight. There is no "we".

19:56.124 --> 20:01.747
There never was a "we". In fact,
without me, there wouldn't even be a "you".

20:02.672 --> 20:09.552
- Just up the hill.
- Listen very carefully: I'm not going.

20:09.803 --> 20:14.714
- Fine, be a jerk. I'll take care of him.
- Yeah, that's good.

20:14.808 --> 20:18.223
You can't even take care of yourself.
This, I gotta see.

20:18.311 --> 20:22.605
I'll return you. We don't need
that meany-weeny mammoth, do we?

20:22.690 --> 20:24.813
No, we don't.

20:54.219 --> 20:57.634
You're an embarrassment to nature.
Do you know that?

20:58.222 --> 21:01.472
This is cake. I'm fine, I'm fine.

21:01.559 --> 21:03.635
I'm gonna die.

21:17.031 --> 21:18.573
Manny.

21:32.337 --> 21:36.251
- That pink thing is mine.
- No. Actually, that pink thing belongs to us.

21:39.301 --> 21:42.717
"Us"? You two are a bit of an odd couple.

21:42.804 --> 21:44.596
There is no "us".

21:44.681 --> 21:48.014
I see. Can't have one of your own,
so you want to adopt.

21:48.101 --> 21:51.220
Look, I'm sorry to interrupt
your snack, but we gotta go.

21:51.396 --> 21:54.895
The baby? Please.
I was returning him to his herd.

21:54.982 --> 21:57.058
Oh, yeah. Nice try, bucktooth.

21:57.151 --> 21:59.227
- Callin' me a liar?
- I didn't say that.

21:59.319 --> 22:01.395
You were thinkin' it.

22:01.488 --> 22:04.157
I don't like this cat. He reads minds.

22:04.699 --> 22:08.317
- Name's Diego, friend.
- Manfred, and I'm not your friend.

22:08.578 --> 22:15.659
Fine, Manfred. If you're lookin' for the
humans, you're wastin' your time. They left.

22:15.751 --> 22:18.917
Thanks for the advice. Now beat it.

22:19.004 --> 22:23.048
I'll help you bring it to its herd,
but leave me alone after that.

22:23.133 --> 22:26.715
- OK. OK, deal. What's your problem?
- You are my problem.

22:26.803 --> 22:31.132
I think you're stressed, so you eat too much.
It's hard to get fat on a vegan diet.

22:31.223 --> 22:35.351
I'm not fat. It's all this fur.
It makes me look poofy.

22:35.436 --> 22:39.350
All right, you have fat hair.
But when you're ready to talk, I'm here.

22:42.484 --> 22:45.852
What are you doin'? Just drop it on the ledge.

22:45.945 --> 22:49.112
- We should make sure they found him.
- Good idea.

22:49.198 --> 22:51.689
No, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

22:51.784 --> 22:53.907
Don't spear me.

22:57.289 --> 23:00.076
- This is a problem.
- Now what?

23:01.126 --> 23:03.699
That's perfect.

23:33.822 --> 23:36.360
- I told you they were gone.
- Look who it is.

23:36.449 --> 23:39.154
Don't you have some
poor animal to disembowel?

23:39.244 --> 23:43.075
They couldn't be far. I mean,
they went this way, or this way?

23:43.164 --> 23:45.536
You don't know much
about tracking, do you?

23:45.666 --> 23:49.498
I'm a sloth. I see a tree,
eat a leaf. That's my tracking.

23:49.586 --> 23:51.828
You didn't miss them by much.

23:51.922 --> 23:55.337
It's still green.
They headed north two hours ago.

23:55.717 --> 23:59.880
It's still green.
They headed north two hours ago.

24:02.223 --> 24:04.892
You don't need this aggravation.

24:05.851 --> 24:09.683
Give me the baby. I can
track humans down a lot faster than you.

24:09.771 --> 24:12.476
And you're just a good citizen helpin' out?

24:12.566 --> 24:16.100
- I just know where the humans are going.
- Glacier Pass.

24:16.194 --> 24:19.776
Everybody knows they have
a settlement on the other side.

24:20.740 --> 24:25.697
Unless you know how to track, you'll never
reach them before snow closes the pass.

24:25.828 --> 24:28.864
Which should be, like, tomorrow.

24:28.955 --> 24:34.791
So, you can give that baby to me,
or go get lost in a blizzard. It's your choice.

24:41.467 --> 24:45.760
Here's your little bundle of joy.
We're returning it to the humans.

24:45.846 --> 24:51.385
The big, bad tigey-wigey gets left behind.
Poor tigey-wigey.

24:51.476 --> 24:54.311
Sid, tigey-wigey is gonna lead the way.

24:57.857 --> 25:00.526
Manny, can I talk to you for a second?

25:00.609 --> 25:05.437
No. The sooner we find the humans,
the sooner I get rid of Mr Stinky Drool-Face,

25:05.530 --> 25:08.021
and the baby, too.

25:09.117 --> 25:11.786
You won't always have
Jumbo around to protect you.

25:11.869 --> 25:17.492
And when that day comes, I suggest you
watch your back, cos I'll be chewin' on it.

25:17.583 --> 25:21.367
Über-tracker. Up front, where I can see you.

25:21.461 --> 25:23.039
Help me.

25:38.769 --> 25:42.469
You gotta make it stop.
I can't take it any more.

25:42.647 --> 25:46.775
- I've eaten things that complained less.
- He won't stop squirming.

25:46.860 --> 25:48.982
- Watch its head.
- Put it down.

25:49.070 --> 25:51.643
Jeez, "pick him up, put him down... "

25:51.948 --> 25:55.197
- Its nose is dry.
- That means something's wrong with it.

25:55.284 --> 25:58.285
- Someone should lick it. Just in case.
- I'll do it.

25:58.370 --> 26:00.825
- He's wearing one of those baby thingies.
- So?

26:00.914 --> 26:03.701
So if he poops, where does it go?

26:06.085 --> 26:10.083
- Humans are disgusting.
- OK, you. Check for poop.

26:10.172 --> 26:13.422
- Why am I the poop-checker?
- Returning him was your idea,

26:13.509 --> 26:16.960
you're small and insignificant,
and I'll pummel you if you don't.

26:17.054 --> 26:19.544
- Why else?
- Now, Sid.

26:26.187 --> 26:29.353
I mean, my goodness.
Look out. Coming through.

26:29.440 --> 26:32.310
- Watch out.
- Stop wavin' that thing around.

26:32.401 --> 26:35.152
I'm gonna slip.

26:38.573 --> 26:40.862
It's clean. Got ya!

26:43.077 --> 26:45.153
Will you cut it out?

26:46.998 --> 26:49.868
Do that again. He likes it.

26:51.960 --> 26:55.127
It's makin' me feel better too.

26:55.213 --> 26:57.372
Here, you hold it.

27:03.930 --> 27:05.673
Turn him towards me.

27:05.931 --> 27:08.173
Where is the baby?

27:09.184 --> 27:11.426
There he is.

27:11.520 --> 27:14.355
Where is the baby?

27:14.856 --> 27:18.059
There he is.

27:18.234 --> 27:20.690
Stop it. You're scarin' him.

27:24.824 --> 27:27.279
- I bet he's hungry.
- How about some milk?

27:27.368 --> 27:30.404
- I'd love some.
- Not you. The baby.

27:30.495 --> 27:33.117
I ain't exactly lactating right now, pal.

27:33.206 --> 27:35.958
- You're a little low on the food chain to...
- Enough.

27:36.042 --> 27:39.577
Enough, enough, enough.

27:42.089 --> 27:44.165
Food.

27:52.349 --> 27:54.056
I don't know, but I've been told

27:54.142 --> 27:56.265
I don't know, but I've been told

27:56.352 --> 28:00.519
End of the world be mighty cold

28:00.940 --> 28:03.431
Prepare for the Ice age!

28:03.525 --> 28:06.016
Protect the dodo way of life!

28:06.111 --> 28:10.405
Survival separates the dodos from the beasts!

28:11.491 --> 28:14.112
Protect the dodo way of life!

28:14.202 --> 28:16.443
Prepare for the Ice age!

28:16.537 --> 28:19.538
- Ice age?
- I've heard of these crackpots.

28:22.459 --> 28:24.997
- Intruders.
- Now, don't fall in.

28:25.087 --> 28:29.131
- If you do, you will definitely...
- Intruders. Intruder...

28:30.884 --> 28:32.793
<i>.. burn and die.</i>

28:33.928 --> 28:37.094
Can we have our melon back?
Junior's hungry and...

28:37.181 --> 28:40.466
No way. This is our private
stockpile for the Ice age.

28:40.642 --> 28:44.722
Sub arctic temperatures will force us
underground for a billion years.

28:44.813 --> 28:46.889
So you got three melons?

28:48.400 --> 28:52.444
If you weren't smart enough
to plan ahead, then doom on you.

28:52.528 --> 28:56.228
Doom on you. Doom on you. Doom on you.

28:56.323 --> 28:59.110
- Get away from me.
- Doom on you.

28:59.201 --> 29:01.490
Oh, no. No.

29:01.870 --> 29:05.488
Retrieve the melon.
Tae kwon dodos, attack.

29:17.134 --> 29:20.752
- The melon.
- The melon, the melon, the melon...

29:22.514 --> 29:24.839
There goes our last female.

29:32.356 --> 29:35.891
- Got it, got it, got it.
- Don't got it.

29:36.860 --> 29:39.351
The last melon.

31:06.066 --> 31:09.150
Sid. Now we gotta find more food.

31:12.489 --> 31:16.486
Right, more to the right. Right, right, right.

31:16.576 --> 31:20.241
- Look at that. Dinner and a show.
- Left, left, left.

31:26.168 --> 31:30.212
Now to find a meal
befitting a conquering hero.

31:32.757 --> 31:36.126
What ho? A foe? Come on,
come on. You want a piece of me?

31:39.764 --> 31:41.839
Spoils worthy of such a noble...

31:50.982 --> 31:53.058
Bedtime, squirt.

32:02.743 --> 32:04.652
The triumphant return.

32:04.745 --> 32:07.615
Huh? Oh, that.

32:08.707 --> 32:13.083
I'm so full. How about a good-night
kiss for your big buddy, Sid?

32:13.836 --> 32:16.920
- He's asleep.
- I was talking to you.

32:17.798 --> 32:19.921
Fine, I'll tuck myself in.

32:26.264 --> 32:29.384
All right, good night.

32:51.912 --> 32:54.071
Will you stop it?

32:54.415 --> 32:57.202
All right, all right. I was trying to relax.

33:02.881 --> 33:04.957
Oy.

33:53.135 --> 33:56.468
- What the...?
- Slice me. It'll be the last thing you ever do.

33:56.555 --> 34:00.172
- I'm workin' here, you waste of fur.
- Frustrated, Diego?

34:00.266 --> 34:03.302
Tracking down helpless infants
too difficult for you?

34:03.394 --> 34:07.474
- What are you two doin' here?
- Soto's getting tired of waiting.

34:07.565 --> 34:12.855
Yeah, he said "Come back with the baby,
or don't come back at all. "

34:14.404 --> 34:16.728
I have a message for Soto.

34:16.822 --> 34:19.313
Tell him I'm bringing the baby.

34:20.534 --> 34:22.775
And tell him I'm bringing...

34:23.371 --> 34:25.446
a mammoth.

34:25.539 --> 34:28.208
- A mammoth?
- Mammoths never travel alone.

34:28.833 --> 34:32.416
This one does,
and I'm leading him to Half Peak.

34:33.963 --> 34:36.205
Look at all that meat. Let's get him.

34:36.299 --> 34:40.545
Not yet. We'll need the whole pack
to bring this mammoth down.

34:40.636 --> 34:42.712
Get everyone ready.

34:43.389 --> 34:45.465
Now.

35:08.620 --> 35:11.786
- Where's the baby?
- You lost it?

35:13.374 --> 35:14.572
Sid.

35:15.460 --> 35:19.160
It's so ugly. Positively adorable.

35:19.255 --> 35:23.122
Hello, pumpkin. Hello, little baldy bean.

35:23.383 --> 35:27.250
- Where'd you find it?
- The poor kid, all alone in the wild.

35:27.387 --> 35:29.593
Sabres were closing in on him.

35:29.681 --> 35:32.681
- So I just snatched him.
- So brave.

35:32.767 --> 35:37.559
Yeah, well, he needed me,
and I only wish I had one of my own, too.

35:37.646 --> 35:41.810
Really? I find that attractive in a male.

35:41.900 --> 35:45.518
Alas. Who wouldn't want
a family, I always say.

35:46.112 --> 35:49.813
- Where've you been hiding?
- Yeah, well, you know...

35:53.286 --> 35:57.069
Cute kid, huh? So, as I was saying, ladies...

35:59.249 --> 36:01.822
Hey. Hi, Manny.

36:02.377 --> 36:04.785
What's the matter with you?

36:05.088 --> 36:09.465
Excuse me, ladies. You just keep
marinating and I'll be right back.

36:11.886 --> 36:13.962
Sexy.

36:14.555 --> 36:17.758
He's not much to look at,
but it's so hard to find a family guy.

36:17.850 --> 36:21.301
Tell me about it.
All the sensitive ones get eaten.

36:21.895 --> 36:25.477
No, no, no. Manny, please,
I'm begging you. I need him.

36:25.565 --> 36:29.147
- A good-lookin' guy like you?
- You say that, but you don't mean it.

36:29.235 --> 36:33.731
No, seriously. Look at you.
Those ladies, they don't stand a chance.

36:33.822 --> 36:37.321
- You have a cruel sense of humour.
- Don't let me cramp your style.

36:37.409 --> 36:40.445
- Thanks, Manny. You're a pal.
- Without Pinky.

36:40.537 --> 36:42.862
Manny, I need him.

36:46.459 --> 36:49.495
So, ladies, where were we?

36:49.795 --> 36:52.500
- Carl.
- Easy, Frank.

36:55.175 --> 36:59.504
Pretty tail walks by, suddenly he moves
like a cheetah. And that tiger...

36:59.596 --> 37:03.427
Yeah, Mr Great Tracker.
Can't even find a sloth.

37:03.516 --> 37:07.383
What am I? The wet nurse?
What are you lookin' at, bone bag?

37:09.647 --> 37:13.347
Look at you. You're gonna
grow into a great predator.

37:13.775 --> 37:18.152
I don't think so. What have you got?
You got a little patch of fur.

37:18.238 --> 37:20.775
No fangs, no claws.

37:20.865 --> 37:24.234
You're folds of skin wrapped in mush.

37:24.619 --> 37:27.323
What's so threatening about you?

37:32.542 --> 37:35.460
Does this look like
a petting zoo to you? Huh?

37:38.339 --> 37:41.957
OK. All right, wise guy.
You just earned a time-out.

37:44.929 --> 37:47.882
You think that's funny? How about this?

37:50.017 --> 37:52.804
You'll be a little snack for the owls.

37:54.521 --> 37:57.687
You're a brave little squirt, I'll give you that.

38:03.779 --> 38:08.405
Thank goodness. Thank goodness.
No. A tiger.

38:08.492 --> 38:11.029
Help. Help.

38:11.161 --> 38:13.319
- Where's the baby?
- Manfred has him.

38:13.413 --> 38:17.624
Just put me in your mouth.
Come on. Hurry up. He got me.

38:18.584 --> 38:19.615
Help.

38:19.710 --> 38:22.283
- Get away from me.
- It went this way.

38:23.088 --> 38:25.377
Over here.

38:33.056 --> 38:35.593
Carl. The tiger beat us to him.

38:37.059 --> 38:39.633
Wait a minute.

38:44.608 --> 38:47.099
He's dead all right.

38:47.194 --> 38:49.316
Carnivores have all the fun.

38:51.864 --> 38:56.609
Gosh, I hate breaking their hearts
like that. But you know how it is.

38:57.411 --> 39:00.116
All right, thanks. You can put me down now.

39:00.706 --> 39:02.864
Manny. Manny.

39:03.250 --> 39:07.164
Guys, I thought we were in a hurry.
And Diego, spit that out.

39:07.253 --> 39:10.338
You don't know where it's been.

39:10.423 --> 39:14.171
Boy. For a second there,
I thought you were gonna eat me.

39:14.260 --> 39:17.379
- I don't eat junk food.
- Thought you were gonna...

39:17.471 --> 39:19.878
I thought you were gonna... Were you?

39:22.684 --> 39:27.642
Come on, wait up. Wait up. Come on,
come on. Can you wait a second, please?

39:27.730 --> 39:29.806
Fellas.

39:31.067 --> 39:33.143
Thanks for waiting.

39:33.235 --> 39:35.940
Three, two, one...

39:38.866 --> 39:40.941
Sure is faithful.

39:55.798 --> 39:57.956
- Don't make me reach back.
- He started it.

39:58.050 --> 40:01.299
I don't care who started it. I'll finish it.

40:34.082 --> 40:36.953
Modern architecture. It'll never last.

40:51.431 --> 40:53.471
Hiya, Manny.

40:55.393 --> 40:57.635
Hi, Diego.

41:04.527 --> 41:06.603
Hey, Sid.

41:06.987 --> 41:10.735
- You're lost.
- No. I know exactly where we are.

41:10.824 --> 41:13.149
Ask him directions.

41:13.243 --> 41:15.912
- I don't need directions.
- Fine, I'll ask him.

41:15.995 --> 41:19.115
Buddy. You see any humans go by here?

41:22.251 --> 41:25.252
I love this game. I love this game. OK, OK.

41:25.337 --> 41:29.798
Three words. First word.
Stomp. No, no. Stamp, stamp.

41:29.883 --> 41:32.041
Let me try. Pack.

41:32.219 --> 41:36.382
Good one, Manny.
Pack of long teeth and claws.

41:37.932 --> 41:39.971
Pack of wolves? Pack of...

41:40.059 --> 41:42.764
Pack of bears? Pack of fleas?

41:42.853 --> 41:44.929
Pack of whiskers? Pack of noses?

41:45.314 --> 41:47.602
- Pachyderm?
- Pack of lies.

41:47.691 --> 41:50.645
Pack of troubles. Pack a wallop.
Pack of birds.

41:50.902 --> 41:52.978
Pack of flying fish.

42:42.366 --> 42:44.654
Great news. I found a short cut.

42:47.579 --> 42:51.623
- What do you mean, short cut?
- I mean faster than the long way around.

42:51.916 --> 42:53.873
I know what a short cut is.

42:53.959 --> 42:59.250
Either we beat the humans to Glacier Pass
or we take the long way and miss 'em.

42:59.464 --> 43:03.082
Through there? What do you take me for?

43:03.176 --> 43:06.627
This time tomorrow,
you could be a free mammoth.

43:07.055 --> 43:09.724
Or a nanny. I never get tired of peek-a-boo.

43:09.807 --> 43:12.724
Guys. Guys. Check this out.

43:15.062 --> 43:17.600
Sid, the tiger found a short cut.

43:19.733 --> 43:21.809
No, thanks. I choose life.

43:21.902 --> 43:24.523
Then I suggest you take the short cut.

43:24.654 --> 43:28.486
- Are you threatening me?
- Move, sloth!

43:33.495 --> 43:35.951
Way to go, tiger.

43:36.039 --> 43:38.530
Quick. Get inside.

44:01.229 --> 44:03.898
OK, I vote short cut.

44:18.495 --> 44:22.159
Guys, stick together.
It's easy to get lost in here.

44:37.762 --> 44:39.838
Guys?

44:57.155 --> 44:59.194
A fish.

45:41.528 --> 45:45.656
Will you keep up, please?
Hard enough to keep track of one baby.

46:30.907 --> 46:32.982
I gotcha.

46:49.632 --> 46:52.123
Captain, iceberg ahead.

46:58.557 --> 47:00.633
Oh, no.

47:51.939 --> 47:54.227
Yeah. Who's up for round two?

47:58.695 --> 48:00.771
Tell the kid to be more careful.

48:42.067 --> 48:44.938
Look, look. Tigers.

48:46.989 --> 48:51.734
No, it's OK, it's OK. Look, the tigers
are just playing tag with the antelope.

48:53.786 --> 48:58.282
- With their teeth.
- Come on, Sid, let's play tag.

48:58.374 --> 49:00.450
You're it.

49:01.627 --> 49:04.830
Sure. OK, OK, OK, where are the sloth’s?

49:04.922 --> 49:07.792
You never see any sloth’s.
Have you ever noticed?

49:07.883 --> 49:11.465
- Look, Manny, a mammoth.
- Somebody pinch me.

49:11.553 --> 49:14.755
Hey, hey, this fat one looks just like you.

49:15.640 --> 49:17.965
And he's got a family.

49:18.058 --> 49:21.427
And he's happy.
Look, he's playing with his kid.

49:21.520 --> 49:25.220
See? That's your problem.
That's what mammoths are supposed to do.

49:25.315 --> 49:28.067
- Sid...
- Find a she-mammoth, have baby mammoths...

49:28.151 --> 49:29.610
- Sid.
- What?

49:29.694 --> 49:31.770
- Shut up.
- But...

52:59.510 --> 53:01.798
Would you look at that.

53:01.887 --> 53:04.923
The tiger actually did it. There's Half Peak.

53:05.015 --> 53:07.719
Next stop, Glacier Pass.

53:08.101 --> 53:11.884
- How could I ever have doubted you?
- Did you hear that, little fella?

53:11.979 --> 53:14.055
You're almost home.

53:18.777 --> 53:21.315
- My feet are sweating.
- Do we need a newsflash

53:21.405 --> 53:24.773
- every time your body does something?
- Ignore him.

53:24.866 --> 53:28.069
Seriously. My feet are really hot.

53:33.791 --> 53:36.116
Tell me that was your stomach.

53:36.210 --> 53:38.416
I'm sure it was just thunder.

53:38.712 --> 53:41.629
From underground?

54:01.900 --> 54:04.058
Come on, keep up with me.

54:04.152 --> 54:06.939
I would if you were moving.

54:09.323 --> 54:12.490
- I wish I could jump like that.
- Wish granted.

54:16.872 --> 54:21.249
- Come on, move faster.
- Have you noticed the river of lava?

54:40.476 --> 54:42.552
Hold Pinky.

55:14.007 --> 55:16.165
Manny.

55:27.603 --> 55:32.311
Manny, Manny, Manny, you OK?
Come on, come on, say something. Anything.

55:34.692 --> 55:36.768
What? What? I can't hear you.

55:36.944 --> 55:39.186
You're standing on my trunk.

55:41.198 --> 55:44.649
- You're OK. You're OK.
- Why did you do that?

55:44.743 --> 55:47.495
You could have died, trying to save me.

55:47.913 --> 55:50.486
That's what you do in a herd.

55:50.582 --> 55:52.740
You look out for each other.

55:52.917 --> 55:55.206
Well, thanks.

55:57.380 --> 56:01.958
I don't know about you guys,
but we are the weirdest herd I've ever seen.

56:20.317 --> 56:23.353
I can't wait to get
my claws in that mammoth.

56:23.445 --> 56:27.229
No one touches the mammoth
until I get that baby.

56:30.618 --> 56:33.287
First, I'll slice its hind quarters into sections.

56:33.371 --> 56:37.582
- I'll put the white meat in one pile and...
- Knock it off. I'm starving.

56:37.666 --> 56:41.366
Next, the shoulders. Occasionally
tough, but extremely juicy.

56:41.461 --> 56:44.664
- I told you to knock it off.
- Save your energy.

56:44.756 --> 56:47.757
Mammoths don't go down easy.

56:48.009 --> 56:50.334
There's only one way to do it.

56:50.470 --> 56:53.007
First, you have to force it into a corner.

56:53.848 --> 56:57.679
Cut off its retreat.
And when you three have it trapped,

56:57.935 --> 57:00.057
I'll go for the throat.

57:10.029 --> 57:12.816
Guys, we gotta get this kid outta the wind.

57:17.077 --> 57:19.366
- How much further?
- Three miles.

57:19.454 --> 57:22.823
I'm beat. We'll get there in the morning.

57:25.960 --> 57:29.625
- What are you doin'?
- I'm putting sloth’s on the map.

57:32.508 --> 57:35.674
Why don't you make it realistic
and draw him lying down?

57:35.761 --> 57:37.837
And make him rounder.

57:40.390 --> 57:44.174
- Perfect.
- I forgot how to laugh.

57:51.567 --> 57:53.643
I'm a genius.

57:57.322 --> 58:02.280
From now on you'll have to
refer to me as Sid, Lord of the Flame.

58:02.493 --> 58:05.909
Lord of the Flame, your tail's on fire.

58:13.920 --> 58:17.918
Thank you. From now on,
I'm gonna call you Diego.

58:18.007 --> 58:20.332
Lord of Touch Me and You're Dead.

58:20.426 --> 58:23.546
I'm just kiddin', you little knucklehead.

58:24.096 --> 58:26.302
Lovebirds.

58:26.390 --> 58:28.466
Look at this.

58:32.395 --> 58:34.471
I don't believe it.

58:47.910 --> 58:52.904
Come here, you little biped.
Come here, you little wormy-worm.

58:52.998 --> 58:55.204
Come to Uncle Sid.

58:55.291 --> 58:58.327
No, no, no, no, no, no. This way. This way.

58:59.420 --> 59:02.125
No, no, no. No, go to him.

59:03.257 --> 59:05.333
Go to him.

59:07.719 --> 59:09.000
OK.

59:10.388 --> 59:14.137
Good job. Keep practisin'.

59:17.061 --> 59:20.227
Look at that. Our little guy is growing up.

59:22.524 --> 59:25.560
All right, come on. Sleep time, lumpy.

59:31.199 --> 59:33.275
Look at that big pushover.

59:34.869 --> 59:39.198
You know, Diego, I've never had
a friend who would risk his life for me.

59:39.623 --> 59:43.952
Yeah, Manny's... he's a good guy.

59:44.378 --> 59:46.453
Yeah, he is.

59:47.172 --> 59:49.579
Well, good night.

01:00:21.661 --> 01:00:27.248
Let's get you all cleaned up. What's your
daddy gonna say if you go back all stinky?

01:00:28.084 --> 01:00:32.164
Let me just clean that up.
That looks good. A little bit here.

01:00:32.254 --> 01:00:36.086
- You clean up nice, little fella.
- I think he's starting to look like me.

01:00:36.175 --> 01:00:38.250
Diego, what do you think?

01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:42.342
- Maybe we shouldn't do this.
- Why not?

01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:46.214
If we save him, he'll be a hunter.
And who do you think he'll hunt?

01:00:46.434 --> 01:00:48.841
Maybe because we save him,
he won't hunt us.

01:00:48.936 --> 01:00:53.514
Yeah, and maybe he'll grow fur and
a long skinny neck and call you Mama.

01:00:54.066 --> 01:00:59.440
- What's your problem?
- Nothing. Let's go. I'm freezing my tail off.

01:01:18.755 --> 01:01:20.913
Diego. You frozen back there?

01:01:25.177 --> 01:01:27.170
- Get down.
- What?

01:01:27.263 --> 01:01:29.551
- Get down and follow me.
- What's goin' on?

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:34.681
At the bottom of Half Peak,
there's an ambush waiting for you.

01:01:34.770 --> 01:01:37.058
- What?
- What do you mean, "ambush"?

01:01:39.274 --> 01:01:41.432
- You set us up.
- It was my job.

01:01:41.526 --> 01:01:45.108
- I was to get the baby, but then...
- You brought us home for dinner.

01:01:45.196 --> 01:01:47.983
- That's it. You're out of the herd.
- I'm sorry.

01:01:48.073 --> 01:01:50.149
No, you're not. Not yet.

01:01:50.367 --> 01:01:54.032
- Listen, I can help you.
- Stay close, Sid. We can fight our way out.

01:01:54.204 --> 01:01:57.370
You can't. The pack's too strong.
You have to trust me.

01:01:57.457 --> 01:02:00.742
Trust you? Why in the world
would we trust you?

01:02:00.835 --> 01:02:02.911
Because I'm your only chance.

01:02:16.557 --> 01:02:18.597
Hello, ladies.

01:02:19.477 --> 01:02:24.933
- Look who decided to show up.
- Diego, I was beginning to worry about you.

01:02:25.024 --> 01:02:31.275
No need to worry. In about two minutes
you'll be satisfying your taste for revenge.

01:02:31.404 --> 01:02:33.112
Very nice.

01:02:33.490 --> 01:02:36.574
I see the sloth. And he's got the baby.

01:02:36.659 --> 01:02:42.033
Don't give away your positions until you
see the mammoth. He's the one to surprise.

01:02:43.248 --> 01:02:45.739
You want to maul something, don't you?

01:02:45.834 --> 01:02:49.333
- I wanna maul.
- Then what are you waiting for?

01:02:52.215 --> 01:02:55.002
No, I said wait for the mammoth.

01:03:17.029 --> 01:03:20.196
Backscratcher. Eat my powder!

01:03:35.796 --> 01:03:37.872
Loop-de-loop.

01:03:38.882 --> 01:03:41.041
Slalom! Slalom, baby!

01:04:06.741 --> 01:04:10.573
Sorry, fellas. He got a little frostbite.

01:04:12.204 --> 01:04:14.280
Get him.

01:04:17.292 --> 01:04:19.368
Surprise!

01:04:24.299 --> 01:04:28.960
OK, follow me. We'll pick up Sid
and get outta here while we can.

01:04:29.053 --> 01:04:33.002
Come on, Diego,
let's bring this mammoth down.

01:04:45.359 --> 01:04:47.684
There he is.

01:04:49.738 --> 01:04:52.194
That's right. Where's the baby?

01:04:56.077 --> 01:04:59.363
Survival of the fittest.

01:04:59.456 --> 01:05:02.290
I don't think so. Yeah.

01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:18.006
- What are you doing?
- Leave the mammoth alone.

01:05:20.933 --> 01:05:23.969
Fine. I'll take you down first.

01:06:39.922 --> 01:06:41.998
We did it.

01:06:54.727 --> 01:06:57.396
We were some team, huh?

01:06:58.147 --> 01:07:01.562
Were? Come on, we're still a team.

01:07:02.025 --> 01:07:04.598
I'm sorry I set you up.

01:07:05.111 --> 01:07:07.946
You know me -
I'm too lazy to hold a grudge.

01:07:11.284 --> 01:07:13.359
Knock it off, squirt.

01:07:14.328 --> 01:07:16.367
You gotta be strong.

01:07:16.705 --> 01:07:20.038
You have to take care of Manfred and Sid.

01:07:21.042 --> 01:07:23.082
Especially Sid.

01:07:23.169 --> 01:07:27.036
Come on, you can lick this. You're a tiger.

01:07:27.131 --> 01:07:30.251
Look, I'll carry you.
Come on, what do you say?

01:07:30.343 --> 01:07:32.631
Come on, Diego, come on.

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:34.878
Tell him he's going to be OK, Manny.

01:07:36.431 --> 01:07:40.096
Listen, you have to leave me here.

01:07:40.185 --> 01:07:44.396
If those humans get through the pass,
you'll never catch them.

01:07:45.023 --> 01:07:48.107
You didn't have to do that.

01:07:48.192 --> 01:07:50.944
That's what you do in a herd.

01:11:06.706 --> 01:11:08.782
Don't forget about us.

01:11:08.874 --> 01:11:10.950
OK?

01:11:13.170 --> 01:11:15.922
We won't forget about you.

01:11:55.542 --> 01:11:58.163
Goodbye.

01:11:58.253 --> 01:12:00.708
Goodbye. Goodbye.

01:12:00.797 --> 01:12:03.122
- Sid...
- Bye.

01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:06.626
Bye.

01:12:09.388 --> 01:12:11.795
That's right. Where's the baby?

01:12:11.932 --> 01:12:14.470
Come on, Sid, let's head south.

01:12:32.450 --> 01:12:34.443
Bye.

01:12:35.578 --> 01:12:39.077
Save your breath, Sid.
You know humans can't talk.

01:12:39.582 --> 01:12:41.658
Diego? You're OK.

01:12:41.792 --> 01:12:44.995
- Nine lives, baby.
- You're OK.

01:12:45.087 --> 01:12:47.163
You're OK.

01:12:47.839 --> 01:12:49.915
I could kiss ya.

01:12:51.635 --> 01:12:53.841
Welcome back, partner. Wanna lift?

01:12:53.928 --> 01:12:56.929
No thanks. I gotta save
whatever dignity I've got left.

01:12:57.098 --> 01:13:01.558
You're hanging out with us. Dignity's
got nothing to do with it. I'll take that lift.

01:13:01.644 --> 01:13:04.181
- Yeah, climb aboard.
- Pick me up, buddy.

01:13:04.730 --> 01:13:08.229
Mush. Or not mush. Either way.

01:13:11.986 --> 01:13:14.607
This is gonna be the best migration ever.

01:13:14.697 --> 01:13:19.608
I'll show you my favourite watering holes.
I turn brown when the fungus in my fur dries.

01:13:19.702 --> 01:13:23.485
- Attractive.
- This whole Ice age thing is getting old.

01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:26.913
You know what I could go for?
Global warming.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.084
- Keep dreamin'.
- No, really...

01:14:00.985 --> 01:14:20.185
