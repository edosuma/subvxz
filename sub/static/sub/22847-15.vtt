00:01.168 --> 00:03.337
<i>Previously on</i>
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:03.629 --> 00:06.507
<i>Daisy's powers are the missing key
to manipulating the gravitonium.</i>

00:06.590 --> 00:09.260
<i>I wouldn't have done any of this
if I didn't believe it was gonna work.</i>

00:09.427 --> 00:12.138
- I'll never forgive you.
- You had a psychic split.

00:12.471 --> 00:14.515
But that dark persona, that's not you.

00:14.682 --> 00:16.559
I really don't know where we go from here.

00:16.726 --> 00:19.270
You're standing next to the man
responsible for shooting Talbot.

00:19.437 --> 00:21.856
- Daisy Johnson shot Talbot.
- That was an android.

00:22.023 --> 00:25.651
Come with me. Let me show you
what we're really up against.

00:25.818 --> 00:27.903
<i>My vantage point is much higher
than yours.</i>

00:28.070 --> 00:29.864
I come with you,
my people get away unharmed.

00:30.239 --> 00:31.365
I can agree to that.

00:56.223 --> 00:58.642
I see they've shown you
to your new accommodations.

00:59.101 --> 01:02.897
Of all the blindfolds I've forcibly worn,
that was one of the nicest.

01:03.355 --> 01:05.149
There's a method to this madness.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.778
All of your questions will be answered
in the morning.

01:09.028 --> 01:11.697
Not my first rodeo,
so I may have already figured out

01:11.906 --> 01:13.532
a little bit of what's going on here.

01:14.992 --> 01:18.454
You got the gravitonium
and the total disregard for human safety.

01:18.871 --> 01:24.126
Check. You've got Ivan Drago
and Crusher Creel on the payroll. Check.

01:24.710 --> 01:28.798
And then, there's you, rogue general
operating with zero oversight.

01:29.381 --> 01:32.468
Add it all up, just doesn't feel
like an Air Force operation.

01:33.177 --> 01:34.220
It's not.

01:35.513 --> 01:36.597
It's Hydra.

01:39.934 --> 01:42.561
- I thought we stomped you out.
- Yes.

01:43.521 --> 01:45.231
Just as you were stomped out.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.943
And yet, here we are in the same room.

01:50.486 --> 01:52.196
I'd like to tell you my story...

01:53.030 --> 01:56.075
- and then, I think you'll know it's time.
- Time for what?

01:57.326 --> 02:00.746
It's time for S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra
to finally unite.

02:13.592 --> 02:15.553
<i>Good morning.</i>

02:15.970 --> 02:19.348
<i>Rise and seize the future.</i>

03:16.363 --> 03:20.367
- One more day. Are you excited?
- Excited to be done with these lectures.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.870
I can't stand another one
of these old dudes droning on

03:23.037 --> 03:24.288
- about placement.
- Well, at least

03:24.455 --> 03:26.040
today's guest speaker is cool.

03:26.665 --> 03:29.710
You know, I heard that he once used
alien DNA to actually reverse...

03:29.877 --> 03:31.128
...the body's aging process...

03:31.253 --> 03:33.631
Oh, shut up, Sitwell. You're just jealous.

03:33.797 --> 03:35.507
Of you being a teacher's pet?

03:35.674 --> 03:37.426
They've got you better trained
than any of our mutts.

03:37.593 --> 03:39.511
You're jealous because I am going places

03:39.678 --> 03:41.597
while you will be stuck
in middle management.

03:49.396 --> 03:51.106
Calm down, take a seat.

03:51.315 --> 03:54.068
I know everyone is excited
about graduation tomorrow.

03:54.318 --> 03:58.030
As a reminder, there will be
a final examination tonight.

03:58.405 --> 04:01.825
And now, here to speak to you
about another post-grad opportunity,

04:01.992 --> 04:03.786
please welcome, Daniel Whitehall.

04:11.835 --> 04:14.546
Good morning.
It's an honour to speak with you...

04:15.172 --> 04:17.800
the future of our organisation.

04:18.509 --> 04:23.305
Tomorrow, you will leave these halls
and venture out into society.

04:23.806 --> 04:26.976
And though you may be behind the scenes,
there are many ways

04:27.142 --> 04:30.187
that you can help Hydra
dismantle the oppressive state.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.900
Since World War II,

04:35.067 --> 04:37.695
and the success of Steve Rogers,
there have been

04:38.153 --> 04:40.864
many failed attempts
to create a super soldier.

04:41.907 --> 04:44.785
But after some ungainly setbacks...

04:46.453 --> 04:47.579
we're close.

04:48.038 --> 04:51.792
Close to creating
the most powerful man on Earth.

04:52.251 --> 04:55.212
Now, this
is the Particle Infusion Chamber...

04:56.255 --> 05:00.217
an apparatus that can force human cells
to take on the properties

05:00.384 --> 05:02.219
of a raw material. Imagine...

05:03.220 --> 05:06.557
a man with the density of lead,
with the volatility of cesium

05:06.724 --> 05:09.143
and the possibilities are endless.

05:10.644 --> 05:13.230
Can someone name another substance
suitable for infusion?

05:13.647 --> 05:15.190
Yes, Mr Von Strucker.

05:17.276 --> 05:18.652
Why not use...

05:19.528 --> 05:21.113
Red Skull's Tesseract?

05:21.697 --> 05:23.657
It's greatest power source we've ever had.

05:24.158 --> 05:25.242
Intriguing.

05:25.701 --> 05:29.079
- Looking to our past for inspiration...
- Well, that's a waste of time.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.665
There's no way that we could take it
from S.H.I.E.L.D. unnoticed,

05:31.832 --> 05:33.083
we would blow our cover.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.086
Well, I suppose you have
a better substance in mind?

05:40.507 --> 05:42.968
We're not gonna find it
by digging up our history.

05:44.219 --> 05:46.430
Instead, we should look
to where the Tesseract came from,

05:46.597 --> 05:47.931
to find new materials.

05:49.099 --> 05:50.142
Meaning?

05:51.518 --> 05:52.561
Outer space.

05:55.481 --> 05:56.648
Finally!

05:57.441 --> 05:58.817
Some forward thinking.

06:20.923 --> 06:24.051
Wh...

07:25.112 --> 07:26.280
Hey.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.454
You're going to S.H.I.E.L.D.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.247
Admin division.

07:36.415 --> 07:37.791
Isn't that what you wanted?

07:40.294 --> 07:41.295
You okay?

07:42.588 --> 07:45.132
- That test was tough for everyone.
- I'm fine.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.259
You hear about your placement yet?

07:48.385 --> 07:50.053
Nothing.

07:50.471 --> 07:51.597
Getting anxious.

07:52.097 --> 07:53.390
Well, I would be too.

07:54.057 --> 07:56.435
Especially if I picked a fight
with Strucker.

07:57.895 --> 07:59.396
You know that he put those two up to that.

07:59.480 --> 08:03.400
Doesn't matter. You punched
the future leader of Hydra in the face.

08:03.567 --> 08:06.278
You screwed your chances of getting
a good placement, genius.

08:06.904 --> 08:09.239
- Uh...
- Miss Hale.

08:09.948 --> 08:11.700
Daniel Whitehall
would like a word with you.

08:20.459 --> 08:22.461
You've made
quite the impression lately.

08:23.545 --> 08:26.089
It seems you're one of the few females
to make it to commencement.

08:27.299 --> 08:30.219
- It's a tough school.
- And you completed your final test?

08:37.934 --> 08:40.102
Well done. It's a rite of passage.

08:40.604 --> 08:44.483
We must eliminate any weakness,
no matter how difficult.

08:44.983 --> 08:47.152
I imagine it wasn't easy
to sleep last night.

08:47.778 --> 08:49.613
Not with all the boys sobbing
through the walls.

08:52.783 --> 08:54.576
Leadership expected nothing less.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.119
In fact...

08:56.537 --> 08:59.164
we're confident
we see the future of Hydra in you.

08:59.331 --> 09:01.500
That's why I've selected you
for my program.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.835
Sir...

09:04.628 --> 09:05.587
I'm honoured.

09:05.671 --> 09:07.839
Um... I've dreamed of working
with you and I... I really think

09:08.006 --> 09:09.841
- that the chamber can revolution...
- No, no.

09:10.467 --> 09:12.261
Von Strucker will be working
on the chamber.

09:15.138 --> 09:17.516
Is... is this because he and I got
into a fight?

09:18.141 --> 09:19.476
In a sense, yes.

09:19.935 --> 09:23.230
We were actually impressed
by your strength...

09:23.981 --> 09:25.065
your mettle.

09:25.732 --> 09:28.569
We think that you will be essential
in engineering

09:28.735 --> 09:31.280
the perfect human specimen
for the chamber.

09:32.197 --> 09:33.198
But...

09:33.615 --> 09:35.742
- Sir, I'm... I'm not a biologist.
- Correct,

09:35.909 --> 09:38.036
but you're the only candidate left
with the other...

09:39.538 --> 09:41.331
necessary qualifications.

09:48.463 --> 09:50.882
- You want me to be...
- Artificially inseminated.

09:52.384 --> 09:53.844
It's quite exciting, yes?

09:54.678 --> 09:56.346
You should be honoured.

09:57.472 --> 10:00.892
You will give birth to our new leader.
As I said...

10:01.727 --> 10:04.062
we see the future of Hydra in you.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.191
What about my future?

10:08.609 --> 10:10.944
As requested, you'll be placed
deep undercover

10:11.111 --> 10:12.613
within the Air Force. Perhaps...

10:13.071 --> 10:14.531
you'll even become an astronaut.

10:15.324 --> 10:19.494
However, once the seed has been perfected,
we expect you'll serve the cause.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.415
Sir...

10:24.958 --> 10:26.209
I'm flattered...

10:27.544 --> 10:30.839
but is there an option where I utilise
my talents elsewhere?

10:33.925 --> 10:37.471
You always have a choice
whether or not to comply.

10:45.937 --> 10:47.105
Hail Hydra.

10:51.401 --> 10:52.569
That's what I thought.

11:07.501 --> 11:09.503
<i>Good morning.</i>

11:09.795 --> 11:12.964
<i>Rise and seize the future.</i>

11:56.007 --> 11:58.760
- Poor boys could never keep up.
- No, her weaknesses

11:58.927 --> 12:00.470
are more glaring than you think.

12:04.558 --> 12:06.351
She doesn't look weak to me.

12:09.312 --> 12:12.566
Any idea what leadership has planned
for her after graduation?

12:13.442 --> 12:16.778
- Oh, they have yet to decide.
- What's to decide?

12:17.863 --> 12:19.990
Whitehall designed her to lead.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.374
Whitehall is dead.

12:36.339 --> 12:38.175
So...

12:38.800 --> 12:41.386
does he know where I'm gonna be assigned
after graduation?

12:42.137 --> 12:43.346
It's being discussed.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.891
He knows that you're top of the class.

12:46.558 --> 12:47.726
Runs in the family.

12:48.727 --> 12:51.188
You don't think they're gonna stick me
somewhere boring like Air Force, do you?

12:51.354 --> 12:55.025
Hey, hold on. I happen to think
that Air Force is very good placement.

12:55.192 --> 12:57.736
You get to see combat,
flight training.

12:58.612 --> 13:01.406
You could even become an astronaut.
That's why I joined.

13:01.907 --> 13:03.116
An astronaut?

13:03.658 --> 13:06.578
Why didn't you ever tell me?
That would have been so cool.

13:06.870 --> 13:08.455
You would have been like ten times cooler.

13:08.622 --> 13:10.874
Maybe.

13:12.876 --> 13:14.294
But I wouldn't have had you.

13:20.759 --> 13:23.762
Let me guess. Your country calls?

13:31.186 --> 13:32.354
Sorry, sweetie.

13:47.077 --> 13:48.078
God!

13:48.912 --> 13:50.080
We've got a problem.

13:50.330 --> 13:53.291
- Is this an Air Force matter?
- S.H.I.E.L.D. captured Gideon Malick.

13:53.458 --> 13:56.294
- Is he talking?
- It's bad. We have to move fast.

13:57.212 --> 13:58.213
Here...

13:58.713 --> 14:01.675
I need you to take this. Locate the device
that's hidden in my vault.

14:01.883 --> 14:04.803
Find somewhere safe.
You're now overseeing communications.

14:04.970 --> 14:09.349
Fischer. Fischer, what is this?
Look at me. What the hell is going on?

14:10.725 --> 14:13.353
Look, after New York,
we found transceivers in the wreckage

14:13.520 --> 14:17.566
of one of the Chitauri cruisers.
We reached out. Someone answered.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.734
You made contact with aliens?

14:20.110 --> 14:22.904
It's an alliance of several races.
They call themselves the Confederacy.

14:23.071 --> 14:25.115
Well, why the hell
wasn't I brought in on this?

14:25.907 --> 14:27.742
General...

14:28.618 --> 14:30.203
I'm gonna need you to come with me.

14:33.540 --> 14:34.624
Come on, Hale.

14:35.041 --> 14:37.168
Step away. This is for your own safety.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.260
Hail Hydra.

14:45.969 --> 14:47.053
Get him!

14:47.637 --> 14:51.641
Fool! Get him to medical now!
How could you let that happen?

14:51.850 --> 14:53.602
Now! Move!

14:54.936 --> 14:57.314
I was looking forward to making
that traitor talk.

15:01.067 --> 15:03.820
- You all right?
- Yeah. I'm fine. I just...

15:05.822 --> 15:07.407
I thought we'd seen the last of Hydra.

15:08.450 --> 15:09.576
Well, don't worry.

15:10.285 --> 15:13.705
After today, you'll never have to see
one of those squids again.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.877
I don't understand what my dog
has to do with me graduating.

15:19.044 --> 15:21.671
Your attachment to that mutt
is a liability. You cannot serve

15:21.838 --> 15:23.924
- until you complete the test.
- I'm the only one left!

15:24.090 --> 15:25.842
You're seriously gonna stop me
from serving,

15:26.009 --> 15:28.720
- because of some barbaric ritual?
- Do not question the Hydra way.

15:28.887 --> 15:32.265
- You trust in the system.
- Why not? Look where it's gotten us.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.643
- We're this close to being wiped out.
- All the more reason

15:34.809 --> 15:36.102
to devote yourself now.

15:36.311 --> 15:39.689
- Eliminate your weakness.
- Wake up! Me obeying you,

15:39.856 --> 15:42.817
that is weakness!
You with your blind faith,

15:42.984 --> 15:45.195
with this stupid tradition,
that's weakness!

15:45.362 --> 15:50.533
No! It is a rite of passage!
To a life built on control and survival!

15:50.700 --> 15:53.411
That's why when you cut off the head,
two more spring up...

16:04.798 --> 16:06.424
And now, we're the last two.

16:11.262 --> 16:13.723
General Talbot.

16:16.768 --> 16:18.269
Your family's here to see you.

16:21.856 --> 16:25.026
<i>Okay, not a train,
because the last one was a train.</i>

16:25.443 --> 16:28.238
Choo-choo. Choo-choo train. Right?

16:28.822 --> 16:31.658
Um... Strawberry? It's not a strawberry.

16:36.871 --> 16:39.290
- It's a cat.
- Nice job, Dad.

16:39.457 --> 16:40.875
- You're on a roll.
- Okay, we can do this

16:40.959 --> 16:43.920
- because I got a mind like a steel trap.
- Hm-mm.

16:44.087 --> 16:47.048
We can get through this. All right,
so the last one's a train...

16:47.757 --> 16:50.635
Wait, I don't understand.
He was getting better

16:50.802 --> 16:53.096
and now you want to transfer him
somewhere...

16:53.263 --> 16:57.392
- More comprehensive.
- But he's getting better. He's calm.

16:57.851 --> 16:59.477
Today's a good day, Mrs Talbot.

16:59.728 --> 17:01.855
But the damage
to his frontal lobe is severe.

17:02.063 --> 17:05.275
It's gonna take a lot more time to retrain
his brain to control his impulses

17:05.442 --> 17:07.318
- and think clearly.
- No! No.

17:07.569 --> 17:10.030
That's not a friggin' cat!
That's not a cat!

17:10.363 --> 17:11.573
- Glenn, honey.
- Mom.

17:11.740 --> 17:14.117
Honey, everything's okay.
George is just trying to help.

17:14.242 --> 17:16.953
No. He showed me this... this...
this tiger.

17:17.162 --> 17:19.622
I said it was a cat and he said
I was right, but I'm not right.

17:19.955 --> 17:22.459
I'm wrong. How am I gonna get better
if nobody is honest with me!

17:22.625 --> 17:24.836
- Sir, take a moment and breathe.
- No, you take a moment!

17:25.002 --> 17:28.715
Stop it! Stop pumping me
full of that junk. You...

17:31.885 --> 17:32.927
Mom!

17:34.012 --> 17:35.263
Let me...

17:38.016 --> 17:39.934
I promise
we'll take very good care of him.

17:52.655 --> 17:54.240
What in the Sam hell?

18:21.518 --> 18:22.519
Hello?

18:28.983 --> 18:29.943
Hello?

18:36.866 --> 18:40.203
Stomach is so hungry,
it's about to digest itself.

18:41.871 --> 18:43.039
Hmm.

18:49.504 --> 18:50.630
Oh.

18:56.928 --> 18:58.596
I still outrank you.

19:12.527 --> 19:15.363
I don't know you. I don't know you.
I don't know you.

19:15.905 --> 19:17.031
Hi!

19:17.657 --> 19:18.783
You wanna tell me...

19:19.826 --> 19:22.078
what we're doing
in this God-forsaken place?

19:28.126 --> 19:29.210
Hey!

19:30.670 --> 19:32.505
Don't you walk away from me, young lady!

19:36.301 --> 19:37.302
Hey!

19:37.552 --> 19:39.470
I don't appreciate being ignored.

19:40.597 --> 19:41.723
You answer me!

19:42.765 --> 19:45.602
You answer me, or I will rip
those sorry little headphones

19:45.768 --> 19:47.187
from your sorry little...

19:47.353 --> 19:49.731
Oh.

19:50.148 --> 19:52.275
I see you've met my daughter, Ruby.

19:53.193 --> 19:56.696
CrossFit Tinkerbell is your daughter?

19:57.322 --> 19:58.781
I've known you 20 years...

19:59.365 --> 20:01.367
you never once mentioned having a child.

20:02.660 --> 20:05.246
I never felt it was anything
you should be concerned with.

20:08.291 --> 20:10.335
General Hale, where the hell am I?

20:11.002 --> 20:12.086
All in due time.

20:12.462 --> 20:14.255
You don't speak
to your commanding officer like that.

20:14.339 --> 20:15.465
You don't speak to a superior...

20:15.548 --> 20:17.675
You don't speak
to a superior officer like that

20:17.759 --> 20:20.803
and as such, I'm ordering you
to tell me exactly what's going on,

20:20.970 --> 20:23.848
because I am not gonna put up
with one more second of this...

20:28.895 --> 20:30.855
Your Air Force career is over.

20:31.522 --> 20:33.399
Your family is afraid of you...

20:34.234 --> 20:38.696
and your lack of impulse control
is a threat to yourself and others.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.583
Why are you telling me this?

20:54.337 --> 20:56.839
Because there was a time in my life
when I felt like

20:56.965 --> 20:59.884
everything was out of control
and I needed a new purpose.

21:00.093 --> 21:02.262
And I see you
going through the same ordeal.

21:03.388 --> 21:05.556
I think you and I can help each other.

21:07.809 --> 21:08.810
How?

21:09.435 --> 21:11.562
Let me show you what I'm working on.

21:14.315 --> 21:16.484
I don't know what the hell this is?
I don't think she knows

21:16.651 --> 21:19.279
what the hell this is.
What the hell is this thing?

21:19.570 --> 21:21.948
What the... What is this thing?
What is this contraption?

21:22.490 --> 21:24.200
To be honest, I have no idea.

21:24.909 --> 21:26.953
They use it to move ships
through the galaxies.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.162
Galaxies?

21:29.289 --> 21:30.540
- You're suggesting...
- Just...

21:31.082 --> 21:32.250
let me explain.

21:36.587 --> 21:39.424
<i>After New York, my predecessors
made contact with life</i>

21:39.590 --> 21:41.050
<i>beyond this solar system.</i>

21:44.470 --> 21:48.933
<i>They gave us this to travel to the stars
and meet with them.</i>

21:50.893 --> 21:52.020
<i>Face to face.</i>

22:03.197 --> 22:06.451
<i>I learned my predecessors
hadn't just made contact.</i>

22:07.618 --> 22:08.953
<i>They had struck a deal...</i>

22:09.829 --> 22:12.081
<i>- for protection.
- From what?</i>

22:12.957 --> 22:14.625
The war coming to Earth.

22:15.168 --> 22:17.337
It's only a matter of time
before it reaches us.

22:19.380 --> 22:21.924
Mm. This one's nuttier
than a Butterfinger.

22:22.050 --> 22:23.676
Reaches us... What, war?

22:24.844 --> 22:27.096
Why didn't this make it up
through the chain of command?

22:27.430 --> 22:30.308
- How come it didn't get to me?
- It's not Air Force, Glenn.

22:30.641 --> 22:33.519
- Then, how did you get a project?
- From General Fischer.

22:34.020 --> 22:35.438
The day that he killed himself.

22:38.608 --> 22:40.735
What flag do you fly, General Hale?

22:41.527 --> 22:42.987
I think that's irrelevant
when you're fighting

22:43.154 --> 22:44.530
- a common enemy.
- What flag...

22:45.323 --> 22:46.616
do you fly?

22:47.575 --> 22:50.370
- Does it matter?
- If you choose those squid billies,

22:51.037 --> 22:52.121
it matters.

22:53.122 --> 22:54.540
I didn't choose Hydra.

22:55.583 --> 22:57.210
I was born into it.

22:57.835 --> 23:01.464
Just like you were born and raised
and indoctrinated

23:01.672 --> 23:05.051
- under the stars and stripes.
- Indoctrinated? No. I wasn't.

23:05.259 --> 23:08.805
I am not some wing nut and I stand
by my red, white and blue.

23:08.971 --> 23:11.349
No. You stand by a country
founded on oppression.

23:11.432 --> 23:13.768
You stand by an eagle on a shield.

23:13.851 --> 23:16.062
Even after you saw
Daisy Johnson shoot you

23:16.229 --> 23:18.523
- in the head point blank.
- That wasn't Daisy!

23:20.608 --> 23:22.568
I know you think I've lost my onions,

23:22.944 --> 23:26.322
but I've got a feeling it was one
of Anton Ivanov's tin cans. Am I wrong?

23:26.489 --> 23:30.368
No. You're right. That was an LMD,
but it was created by S.H.I.E.L.D.

23:30.535 --> 23:32.036
and it was used on you.

23:33.538 --> 23:35.748
Don't you see these symbols
are irrelevant.

23:36.165 --> 23:39.419
We are humans fighting for our survival.

23:39.794 --> 23:43.673
We need every weapon we can get
in this fight, which is why I need you.

23:43.840 --> 23:46.592
You filthy calamari Mata Hari.

23:50.054 --> 23:53.015
Weapon? What kind of a weapon exactly?

23:54.016 --> 23:56.185
It's an old Hydra device.

23:56.394 --> 23:58.729
I'm starting to understand
why I might be here...

23:59.439 --> 24:01.149
but you're not gonna get it from me...

24:01.732 --> 24:04.944
because I have a mind like a steel trap.
That's right.

24:05.820 --> 24:06.863
I'm the one...

24:07.530 --> 24:09.532
that hid the Hydra contraband...

24:10.408 --> 24:12.118
and you wanna know something else?

24:13.411 --> 24:14.620
I'm not talking.

24:15.371 --> 24:17.331
You gotta let go of these old symbols.

24:18.249 --> 24:21.794
You need to let go of the old Talbot.
I am giving you new purpose.

24:22.795 --> 24:24.589
Help me save humanity.

24:25.214 --> 24:30.261
I would rather die on my two legs
than slither on eight with you.

24:39.687 --> 24:44.400
Actually, squids don't have legs.
They have tentacles. They're cephalopods.

24:46.527 --> 24:50.156
Let me out of here or I swear
I will bust your kraken ass!

24:50.323 --> 24:53.367
Let's try this conversation again
when you're feeling more reasonable.

24:53.743 --> 24:55.077
You can't do this!

24:55.786 --> 24:57.788
Let me out!

24:57.997 --> 25:02.001
I'll never talk! You'll never break me!
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s coming through that door

25:02.168 --> 25:06.589
any day now! You just wait and see.
Phil Coulson is coming for me!

25:50.424 --> 25:51.509
Hello?

25:54.428 --> 25:56.514
Is this supposed to keep me
off balance or something?

25:56.889 --> 26:00.476
Having me stumble out
to an Econo Lodge continental breakfast?

26:00.726 --> 26:02.311
I give this ploy a C-minus.

26:03.229 --> 26:04.730
Hey, wait a minute...

26:06.816 --> 26:08.025
"Oops! All Berries."

26:08.568 --> 26:09.902
Okay, C-plus.

26:12.655 --> 26:13.698
By the way...

26:14.156 --> 26:16.617
when Hale's done playing games,
I'll be in my room.

26:33.384 --> 26:34.385
That girl...

26:35.011 --> 26:36.887
the member of your team I haven't met yet.

26:37.388 --> 26:39.890
Is she the one responsible
for cutting my agent's arms off?

26:41.726 --> 26:43.185
That's my daughter, Ruby.

26:48.107 --> 26:50.359
Seems like a major strike
against home schooling.

26:50.901 --> 26:54.614
She's not exactly helping your sales pitch
on the merits of teaming up with Hydra.

26:56.198 --> 26:57.199
You're right.

26:59.910 --> 27:02.288
Why don't you let me show you
what I'm working on?

27:03.039 --> 27:04.206
Bad idea.

27:05.833 --> 27:08.711
- You don't even know what it does.
- I don't need to.

27:09.545 --> 27:11.839
It's got that weird alien writing
on the side.

27:16.552 --> 27:18.012
Longitude...

27:24.602 --> 27:25.728
latitude...

27:29.899 --> 27:30.900
and...

27:31.651 --> 27:32.777
altitude.

27:35.237 --> 27:37.406
You need to elevate your vantage point.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.618
- Would you grab that handle please?
- I'm good.

27:41.494 --> 27:44.288
I've already been to space.
Pretty recently, actually.

27:44.622 --> 27:47.166
- No, you need to meet him for yourself.
- Or what?

28:11.357 --> 28:14.402
Why have you brought this human,
uninvited?

28:14.735 --> 28:16.070
This is Phil Coulson.

28:17.113 --> 28:22.201
He considers himself humanity's shield,
one of Earth's mightiest heroes.

28:27.915 --> 28:29.458
Her words. Not mine.

28:31.836 --> 28:33.546
He's that ally that we need.

28:33.796 --> 28:37.091
I'm hoping that you can show him
the wisdom of helping the Confederacy.

28:37.800 --> 28:38.801
Very well.

28:40.594 --> 28:42.972
Your world will soon
become a battleground.

28:43.848 --> 28:46.183
We will ensure humanity's survival.

28:46.600 --> 28:47.727
For a price?

28:49.270 --> 28:52.606
Much smaller than you'll pay
if this comes to Earth.

29:07.371 --> 29:10.750
So, the shadow guy will save humanity
from the alien warships?

29:11.250 --> 29:13.002
Provided we meet certain terms.

29:13.669 --> 29:17.131
- Let me guess. Gravitonium.
- Amongst other things.

29:18.090 --> 29:21.469
And Inhumans, or engineered warriors
as they call them.

29:21.635 --> 29:22.636
That's why you need me.

29:23.596 --> 29:26.599
Yes. You know where they are,
and how to contact them.

29:26.766 --> 29:30.144
So, you want my help
to arm alien warlords?

29:30.895 --> 29:33.063
You ever consider they may not hold up
their end of the bargain?

29:33.272 --> 29:36.275
That, maybe, something called
the Confederacy will just enslave us all?

29:36.650 --> 29:39.278
- The thought has occurred to me.
- Then, why cooperate with them?

29:39.570 --> 29:40.696
We need to fight back.

29:41.197 --> 29:42.698
Finally. Someone who gets it.

29:43.157 --> 29:45.785
Altering the deal has always been my goal.

29:46.702 --> 29:49.205
Now you see why
we have to stop fighting each other.

29:49.413 --> 29:50.539
And work together.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.961
Right now, the Confederacy thinks
that we have no choice but to cooperate.

29:56.128 --> 29:57.713
And you want to prove
we're not so easily coerced.

29:57.880 --> 29:59.757
Not only that,
but that we're a galactic superpower,

29:59.924 --> 30:01.091
not to be toyed with.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.427
That's gonna require
a significant display of force.

30:03.594 --> 30:06.931
The whole we will not go quietly
into the night bit. What's your plan?

30:07.348 --> 30:09.809
- You're familiar with Dr Whitehall?
- I buried him.

30:10.684 --> 30:11.727
Go team.

30:13.479 --> 30:15.940
We've been searching
for an old Whitehall program.

30:16.148 --> 30:17.733
It's a Particle Infusion Chamber.

30:17.858 --> 30:19.985
It's designed
to create the most powerful man.

30:20.194 --> 30:22.071
- Like Captain America.
- Better than that.

30:23.405 --> 30:26.450
Personally, I'd like to see
the most powerful human not be a man.

30:27.201 --> 30:29.954
If the idea is to put your ninja daughter
into that chamber,

30:30.037 --> 30:31.747
this is gonna be a long conversation.

30:31.872 --> 30:34.917
Cap was selected for his heart,
not cutting off hands.

30:35.501 --> 30:38.128
Ruby is a perfect fit.
Her physical bio metrics

30:38.295 --> 30:40.381
were optimised for particle infusion.

30:40.798 --> 30:42.466
I'm sensing a "but".

30:43.300 --> 30:44.468
She's not ready.

30:45.886 --> 30:47.805
I'm not sure she has the temperament.

30:51.433 --> 30:54.186
I'm wondering if your Daisy Johnson
is a better fit.

30:55.354 --> 30:57.565
You've made her into quite
the formidable soldier.

30:57.857 --> 31:01.026
- "Made" is not the term I would use.
- Well, as far as her heart is concerned,

31:01.277 --> 31:03.863
I hear she sacrificed her own boyfriend
for the greater good.

31:04.071 --> 31:06.156
- Those decisions are not easily made.
- Now, wait a minute.

31:06.323 --> 31:08.617
Look, she's powerful, she's intelligent,
she's calculating.

31:08.826 --> 31:10.703
If the Confederacy needs gravitonium...

31:11.495 --> 31:15.291
- Daisy Johnson is the one to deliver it.
- By infusing her with gravitonium?

31:15.457 --> 31:17.626
Yes. She would have the power
to level alien armies

31:17.793 --> 31:20.588
and blow their ships apart.
She would be worthy of Whitehall's

31:20.754 --> 31:24.258
code name for the project:
"Destroyer of Worlds".

31:25.593 --> 31:28.429
Obviously, the guy was over-compensating
for something, but...

31:28.596 --> 31:33.267
No, no. Stop. This is a huge mistake.
A broken planet-sized mistake.

31:33.350 --> 31:35.686
Listen, my team wasn't hiding
all these months.

31:36.729 --> 31:38.230
We travelled to the future.

31:38.731 --> 31:40.816
We saw the aftermath of that program.

31:42.484 --> 31:45.362
- You travelled to the future?
- And back.

31:45.863 --> 31:49.408
I saw the Earth cracked apart,
but not because of the Confederacy

31:49.575 --> 31:50.826
or that alien ship.

31:51.452 --> 31:54.204
- It was because of my actions.
- Exactly.

31:55.205 --> 31:56.415
Call off the search.

31:56.832 --> 31:59.627
- Do not let anyone enter that chamber.
- Let me ask you something,

31:59.793 --> 32:01.420
in this fever dream of yours,

32:01.587 --> 32:04.006
are you the big strong man
who's saving me

32:04.173 --> 32:06.258
- from my mistakes?
- It's more complicated than that.

32:06.425 --> 32:07.718
- You just...
- I'm sure it is.

32:08.135 --> 32:10.721
I can't tell if you're delusional
or playing games with me.

32:11.972 --> 32:13.724
This is very disappointing.

32:13.933 --> 32:17.144
I thought you of all people
could see the bigger picture.

32:18.020 --> 32:19.647
Clearly,
you're just like the rest of them.

32:20.022 --> 32:21.899
I listened to you, now listen to me,
General.

32:22.066 --> 32:23.192
I've heard enough!

32:23.567 --> 32:26.362
Let's try this conversation again,
when you're feeling more reasonable.

32:26.528 --> 32:30.783
You're making a huge mistake! No!
You have to listen to me!

32:36.413 --> 32:37.456
Hey.

32:40.918 --> 32:42.002
It's cool.

32:44.421 --> 32:45.589
Did you actually...

32:46.757 --> 32:50.094
travel to the future?
'Cause my mum doesn't believe that.

32:50.344 --> 32:52.137
Well aware how crazy it sounds.

32:52.638 --> 32:55.057
So, if you really did see the future,
then...

32:57.351 --> 32:58.811
tell me how I fail.

32:59.853 --> 33:00.938
What do you mean?

33:01.188 --> 33:03.565
You told my mum
that the "Destroyer of Worlds"

33:03.732 --> 33:05.734
cracks the planet apart, so...

33:07.569 --> 33:11.031
- what did I do wrong?
- I hate to burst your apocalyptic bubble,

33:11.699 --> 33:12.866
but it wasn't you.

33:17.413 --> 33:18.872
Daisy Johnson.

33:20.874 --> 33:23.877
- Where is she?
- That's a bad idea, Ruby.

33:24.420 --> 33:26.839
- You can't beat her.
- Yes, I can.

33:28.173 --> 33:29.550
Where is she?

33:31.468 --> 33:32.594
I can't tell you.

33:33.053 --> 33:37.099
But I can recommend some medication,
preferably at a high dosage.

33:37.850 --> 33:40.602
Other than that, I'm not talking.

33:45.774 --> 33:49.028
Why don't I show you how that worked out
for the last guy who said that to me.

33:52.031 --> 33:56.076
Stay calm. Stay quiet.
Stay quiet. Don't even make a sound.

33:57.536 --> 33:59.121
Talbot?

34:02.416 --> 34:03.542
What happened?

34:04.710 --> 34:05.711
Phil?

34:06.128 --> 34:08.672
I told 'em you were coming.
I tried to hold out.

34:09.214 --> 34:10.507
S.H.I.E.L.D. never came.

34:11.216 --> 34:14.219
I'm sorry, Phil. I told 'em everything.
I held out as long as I could,

34:14.386 --> 34:16.096
but S.H.I.E.L.D. didn't show up. Sorry.

34:16.554 --> 34:17.931
Phil, Phil!

34:18.639 --> 34:22.603
Just... Just...
Phil, I'm sorry, Coulson! I'm sorry!

34:28.650 --> 34:29.735
<i>Daisy?</i>

34:30.402 --> 34:31.904
Daisy? Did you hear me?

34:32.862 --> 34:35.114
Yeah, I heard you.
I'm just thinking it through.

34:39.620 --> 34:45.375
- Strucker's escape, Anton, Creel.
- And her connection to General Fischer.

34:45.708 --> 34:46.918
Hale is Hydra.

34:47.960 --> 34:50.880
Hale Hydra. Seriously?

34:51.005 --> 34:54.842
How are we still fighting Nazis today?

34:55.427 --> 34:58.430
More importantly,
why does she need Coulson?

34:58.597 --> 35:01.266
Okay, I don't know
even where to start.

35:01.642 --> 35:03.936
Yeah, obviously, we have to get ahead
of her, but...

35:04.478 --> 35:06.480
we have no leads because everyone
in Hydra's locked up.

35:06.647 --> 35:08.565
But we can't question them
without false documents

35:08.649 --> 35:10.400
which I can't get
without more resources.

35:10.609 --> 35:11.944
- So, there's no... There's...
- Hey!

35:13.070 --> 35:14.738
Coulson chose you for a reason.

35:15.197 --> 35:17.908
Take a breath. This is just another fight.

35:18.158 --> 35:22.704
- No, it's not. I can't quake this away.
- Remember combat training.

35:24.414 --> 35:26.959
Take what you have,
use it to your advantage.

35:27.584 --> 35:28.794
We have nothing.

35:31.213 --> 35:32.422
We have a super villain.

35:45.644 --> 35:47.146
Go on. Let's get it over with.

35:47.396 --> 35:49.356
Tell me that I can't be trusted anymore.

35:49.523 --> 35:51.942
You forget that I was Hydra
in the Framework too.

35:53.026 --> 35:54.403
I know how this works.

35:55.195 --> 35:56.780
I made decisions I regret.

35:57.447 --> 35:58.740
This isn't the Framework.

35:59.449 --> 36:00.534
And truthfully...

36:03.620 --> 36:04.913
I don't regret it.

36:08.292 --> 36:09.793
Just how it had to be done.

36:10.544 --> 36:11.545
Well...

36:12.254 --> 36:14.339
I'm not asking you to apologise for it.

36:17.301 --> 36:18.802
I'm asking you to embrace it.

36:22.055 --> 36:25.726
Okay. Just need to calibrate
the myoelectric interface.

36:26.185 --> 36:28.812
Wouldn't want her suffering
any neural distortion.

36:29.605 --> 36:30.981
No disrespect, but...

36:31.440 --> 36:34.151
you sure you got this?
Or do you need to consult Fitz?

36:34.735 --> 36:35.777
No need.

36:40.032 --> 36:42.242
Listen, I know you went
into the Framework, but...

36:43.285 --> 36:46.121
for those of us
who were really plugged in it was...

36:47.289 --> 36:48.874
It's hard to explain. It's...

36:49.583 --> 36:51.668
It's you but it's not you.

36:52.878 --> 36:54.421
Look, I'm sorry, I'm...
I'm saying this all wrong.

36:54.588 --> 36:56.590
- I understand.
- No, no, what I mean is... is that...

36:57.382 --> 36:59.927
it's not that Fitz is still a bad guy
out here.

37:01.386 --> 37:03.805
It's that he was still a good guy
in there.

37:05.432 --> 37:06.516
Somehow.

37:09.228 --> 37:10.312
I understand.

37:11.605 --> 37:12.731
And thank you.

37:15.192 --> 37:17.319
Okay...

37:18.278 --> 37:19.696
moment of truth.

37:34.670 --> 37:37.756
So, when Yo-Yo wakes up,
she's gonna be stronger than before?

37:38.340 --> 37:39.466
Theoretically.

37:41.843 --> 37:43.053
Is something wrong?

37:43.804 --> 37:45.973
It's just that lately she's been

37:46.306 --> 37:48.725
acting like she's bullet-proof,
like nothing can stop her.

37:49.977 --> 37:52.312
Well, that is not an uncommon attitude

37:52.479 --> 37:54.273
- for our team.
- No. This is different.

37:55.357 --> 37:57.609
Yo-Yo saw herself in the Lighthouse, so...

37:58.277 --> 38:01.822
now she knows for a fact
that she lives far into the future.

38:03.949 --> 38:07.327
So, if Yo-Yo subscribes to Fitz's theory
that time can't be changed, then...

38:07.494 --> 38:08.996
She thinks she can't be killed.

38:12.040 --> 38:14.167
- Interesting.
<i>- What's your conclusion?</i>

38:14.626 --> 38:16.420
Well, we know that Hale went
after gravitonium.

38:16.586 --> 38:19.464
So, unless she's experimenting
with artificial gravity,

38:19.631 --> 38:23.260
- I think she's trying to build a weapon.
- But why does Hale want Coulson?

38:23.719 --> 38:24.761
I don't know.

38:26.013 --> 38:29.808
If we can determine Hale's target,
then we can infer Coulson's role.

38:31.059 --> 38:33.478
We have a lot of intel on file.

38:36.982 --> 38:39.901
I just need a few hours access
to the computers and the labs,

38:40.360 --> 38:41.486
I can figure it out.

38:46.408 --> 38:48.452
I can't help when I'm locked up
in this cell.

38:51.997 --> 38:54.416
- Not a chance.
- I suspected you were listening in.

38:54.624 --> 38:57.336
Yeah and of course your solution
involves us letting you out.

38:57.502 --> 39:00.297
- I'm only trying to help, Daisy.
- He's still on our side.

39:00.464 --> 39:01.923
Don't defend him. Not to me.

39:02.090 --> 39:03.800
There's not a lot of team left here,

39:03.967 --> 39:06.636
- so let's hold it together.
- We had to seal the rift shut.

39:06.845 --> 39:09.348
- By any means, no matter how sadistic.
- Okay, well,

39:09.473 --> 39:10.682
- would you have agreed to do it?
- Never.

39:10.849 --> 39:12.684
Well, then, I didn't have a choice.

39:15.812 --> 39:18.940
You didn't have a choice?
You drugged me,

39:19.232 --> 39:22.235
you restrained me and you cut into me.

39:22.903 --> 39:25.989
I don't feel good about it either.
But in a few hours...

39:26.865 --> 39:29.326
the town up there would have been affected
as well so...

39:30.118 --> 39:31.203
I'm sorry.

39:31.661 --> 39:34.081
I don't need your forgiveness.
I just need you to trust me.

39:34.247 --> 39:37.250
You are not leaving this room.
You are Hydra.

39:37.501 --> 39:40.921
Well, that's an advantage.
I saluted the same flag as those people.

39:41.088 --> 39:42.589
Yeah, but we don't turn on our own here.

39:42.798 --> 39:45.092
Do you want me
to recount all the times that you did?

39:49.888 --> 39:52.224
We'll figure out another way
to track Hale down, we've done it before.

39:52.391 --> 39:54.393
- And it was a trap.
- It'll be different this time.

39:54.559 --> 39:56.144
Yeah,
'cause you've got your powers back

39:56.311 --> 39:57.729
and they've got the gravitonium.

39:57.938 --> 39:59.940
We already sealed one crack in the Earth.

40:02.150 --> 40:05.237
Doesn't take a fortune-teller to see
how easy it would be to make another one.

40:06.863 --> 40:08.824
Are you listening to me? Daisy?

40:14.663 --> 40:16.540
Daisy? Where are you going?

40:18.333 --> 40:19.459
He's right...

40:20.293 --> 40:23.046
it might not take a fortune-teller.
But why not ask one anyway.

40:24.714 --> 40:27.175
You want to bring Robin out of hiding
and risk her getting hurt?

40:27.634 --> 40:29.511
- Daisy...
- Our leader is missing.

40:29.678 --> 40:30.929
We have to get him back.

40:32.639 --> 40:34.891
We need every weapon we can get
in this fight.

40:45.819 --> 40:49.114
Again, I can't do anything
while I'm locked away in this dungeon...

40:51.450 --> 40:52.617
like a...

40:52.993 --> 40:56.663
hideous freckled stepchild.

40:58.457 --> 41:01.293
Please,
you're not in the least bit hideous.

41:03.462 --> 41:05.922
Take it you and Daisy
had a productive chat?

41:06.298 --> 41:08.258
She quaked me against the wall
and then, stormed out.

41:08.383 --> 41:09.926
So, yeah, it was quite productive.

41:13.221 --> 41:14.514
You've got that look.

41:18.268 --> 41:21.313
I've been thinking about you and me,
about us.

41:22.731 --> 41:24.566
- Jemma.
- Relax...

41:26.651 --> 41:28.403
I know we get through this.

41:32.991 --> 41:34.367
Do you recognise this?

41:35.035 --> 41:37.245
Yeah. It's mine.

41:38.580 --> 41:41.541
After my injury, I got the number engraved
because I couldn't remember the name.

41:42.083 --> 41:43.418
See, that's the thing.

41:45.879 --> 41:47.130
This one's yours.

41:54.304 --> 41:56.223
That other tool belongs to Deke.

42:00.227 --> 42:02.646
Who got it from his grandfather.

42:04.022 --> 42:05.148
He's my...

42:06.316 --> 42:07.359
our...

42:10.195 --> 42:11.363
grandson?

42:12.572 --> 42:13.782
Yeah.

42:14.741 --> 42:15.742
But...

42:17.536 --> 42:19.371
he's the worst.

42:21.039 --> 42:22.666
I think he's perfect.

42:23.375 --> 42:27.546
Plus, his very existence proves
that you and I make it to the Lighthouse.

42:28.797 --> 42:31.132
And live long enough to raise a daughter.

42:34.427 --> 42:36.930
- Do you see what this means?
- Yeah. I do. It means

42:37.097 --> 42:39.766
that our daughter's obviously gonna marry
some belligerent space goon,

42:39.933 --> 42:42.143
if she's gonna give birth to a Deke.

42:42.811 --> 42:44.062
No, Fitz...

42:45.230 --> 42:47.399
it means you and I are invincible.
