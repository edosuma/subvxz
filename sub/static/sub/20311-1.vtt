WEBVTT

00:04.212 --> 00:07.048
All right, I'm Mr. Duncan.

00:07.048 --> 00:11.637
Actually the "uncan"
is unnecessary.

00:11.637 --> 00:13.388
You can call me Mr. D.

00:13.388 --> 00:16.016
But, uh, we call
Mr. Dwyer "Mr. D."

00:16.016 --> 00:19.603
Well that's going to be
confusing then for Mr. Dwyer.

00:19.603 --> 00:22.481
Anyway, you're older kids.
I understand that

00:22.481 --> 00:26.151
We're really close in age,
I'm not much older really.

00:26.151 --> 00:29.571
So, I can relate to a lot of the
things and I'm here to help you

00:29.571 --> 00:32.658
with any problems, concerns, OK?

00:32.658 --> 00:36.829
Anorexia, maybe some
drug problems there?

00:36.829 --> 00:40.248
A little low self esteem?
The lip ring?

00:40.248 --> 00:46.213
Maybe a gender issue?
You are a woman...
you are a woman

00:46.213 --> 00:49.008
A very handsome, I'm sorry,
beautiful, not handsome.

00:49.008 --> 00:50.551
Beautiful woman.

00:52.469 --> 00:54.680
Solved that problem.
I see these things,

00:54.680 --> 00:56.974
I see these things
because I care.

00:56.974 --> 00:59.184
Everybody here is
from a different background.

00:59.184 --> 01:01.770
I like that. I've been
to many, many countries.

01:01.770 --> 01:05.232
Almost all of them.
Except for a couple hundred.

01:05.232 --> 01:10.070
All right? Let's pick a country,
see if I've been there.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.948
Japan. Been there. Konnichiwa.

01:12.948 --> 01:17.160
OK, let's do another one.
Middle of the Atlantic Ocean.

01:17.160 --> 01:22.708
Have not been there. Death,
sharks, do not wanna be there.

01:22.708 --> 01:25.920
OK. How long are these classes?

01:25.920 --> 01:30.507
-80 minutes.
-All right, 6...

01:30.507 --> 01:33.092
74 minutes to go.

01:47.357 --> 01:50.861
Excuse me, sorry, thank you.

01:50.861 --> 01:53.572
-Hi, I'm Lisa. I'm new here.
-Oh, I'm Gerry.

01:53.572 --> 01:57.534
I'm not really new
'cause I've been substituting
for a few years.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.787
So, it's just harder
than this regular.

01:59.787 --> 02:02.831
-Right
-Look at that!
That is the French teacher.

02:02.831 --> 02:05.292
-Oh.
-For sure,
they're always so hot.

02:05.292 --> 02:08.879
I teach Social Studies
you know?

02:08.879 --> 02:11.006
-What? What was that?
-Nothing.

02:11.006 --> 02:14.301
Morning folks, settle please,
attention si vous plais.

02:14.301 --> 02:19.389
-Everybody sit down. People!
-Hey! Sit down!

02:19.389 --> 02:22.517
Yeah.

02:22.517 --> 02:25.646
Thank you, yes,
thanks for taking your seats
and settling everyone.

02:25.646 --> 02:29.608
For those of you who
don't know me, my name
is Vice Principal Robert Cheeley

02:29.608 --> 02:32.778
and, uh, I'm thrilled to be
starting another exciting
year here

02:32.778 --> 02:35.697
at Xaviar Academy and my
first task, right on time,

02:35.697 --> 02:39.451
is to introduce the Cap-i-tain.
Our fearless leader. Our hero.

02:39.451 --> 02:41.870
Thank you.
I'll take it from here.

02:41.870 --> 02:43.956
Just a couple of things
I want to go over.

02:43.956 --> 02:48.167
First, welcome all the new
staff. Question? Go ahead.

02:48.167 --> 02:52.547
No I was just,
I was waving... only.

02:52.547 --> 02:57.052
OK, number two: this week
is the parent/teacher
meet and greet.

02:57.052 --> 03:00.221
I want you all to get
your game face on for that.

03:00.221 --> 03:03.017
-This is my game face.
-Oh, good.

03:03.017 --> 03:05.184
I would like to continue
if I could by formally

03:05.184 --> 03:08.605
-introducing the new staff--
-Gerry Duncan. Thank you.

03:08.605 --> 03:14.193
New to this school,
but I have been substituting
for years, which is...

03:14.193 --> 03:17.031
Uh, actually harder he says.

03:17.031 --> 03:20.034
So I'm part of the social
studies department here,

03:20.034 --> 03:24.329
but as you can tell,
my background
is in physical education,

03:24.329 --> 03:27.582
education du physique.

03:30.209 --> 03:33.088
Boom! So...

03:33.088 --> 03:35.632
-My legs are the same.
-Thanks, Gerry, that's great.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.467
But we should probably
get on with the meeting.

03:37.467 --> 03:41.680
Oh, oh, oh, sorry Robert.
Number three:

03:41.680 --> 03:45.559
Our rival, St. Pat's,
this year again

03:45.559 --> 03:49.563
has been rated the number one
private school in the city.

03:49.563 --> 03:52.774
We can't have this.
Now this is our main rival.

03:52.774 --> 03:54.902
This has got to stop.

03:54.902 --> 03:58.321
Principal Davis will be rubbing
this in my face again and again.

03:58.321 --> 04:01.200
It all starts
with our sports teams.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.618
So, Bobbi? Bobbi?

04:03.618 --> 04:08.665
All right, this year let's kick
St. Pat's right in the sack!

04:08.665 --> 04:11.126
Yeah, I am on it! Right
in the sack, sir! You got it!

04:11.126 --> 04:14.713
-[inaudible]
-All right everybody.
Teach hard!

04:14.713 --> 04:17.591
I'm going to teach so hard.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.721
-See where that
phys ed teacher went?
-I'm actually a little nervous.

04:22.721 --> 04:25.766
I don't get nervous,
I have the gift of the gab

04:25.766 --> 04:28.143
and teaching's just gabbing
to kids really.

04:28.143 --> 04:30.979
I shouldn't be nervous,
I have a masters in education

04:30.979 --> 04:33.107
and a PhD in
medieval history, so...

04:33.107 --> 04:36.484
I have a masters in people and
a PhD in natural ability, so...

04:36.484 --> 04:39.446
-Those aren't real.
-Real to me.

04:39.446 --> 04:43.951
Running in the hall,
Mr. Stratton? Congratulations.

04:43.951 --> 04:47.871
You have the honor of being my
first detention of the year.

04:47.871 --> 04:50.874
Can I steal him for a sec?

04:50.874 --> 04:53.043
-What a hard ass, huh?
-Yeah!

04:53.043 --> 04:55.212
Don't run, speed walk.

04:55.212 --> 04:58.048
I was almost in the Olympics for
this. You can't get in trouble.

04:58.048 --> 05:00.008
-Watch. Tell me when to say go.
-Go.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.802
No, wait till I'm ready.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.053
-OK, I'm ready.
-Go!

05:03.053 --> 05:06.556
Watch! Slow, OK, see that?

05:06.556 --> 05:09.434
See? It's all right there,
feet on the ground.

05:09.434 --> 05:11.103
Whew! See?

05:11.103 --> 05:13.272
-[blows whistle]
-All right! Stretch it out,

05:13.272 --> 05:16.191
hold for ten.
Nice, you guys look great.

05:16.191 --> 05:18.819
Those are some
interesting stretches.

05:18.819 --> 05:21.404
-Just a warmup really.
-Well, they should probably
run first,

05:21.404 --> 05:25.200
-but it's your class, so...
-They're training
for a half marathon,

05:25.200 --> 05:27.368
-so I'm limiting
their running right now.
-Half marathon?

05:27.368 --> 05:31.081
I finish my marathons,
but that's just me.

05:31.081 --> 05:34.751
Anyway, if you want some help
from a fellow phys ed'er,

05:34.751 --> 05:40.007
-I am at your beck and call.
-Actually, you know what?

05:40.007 --> 05:43.426
They need someone to coach
the 5/6 girls basketball team.
How 'bout that?

05:43.426 --> 05:47.430
Done! I will coach anything.
Let's do it up!

05:49.099 --> 05:51.810
Yeah, just because you can do
that doesn't mean you can coach.

05:51.810 --> 05:53.187
Anyway...

05:56.439 --> 06:01.069
Hello, Miss Trudy Walsh!
Hello, hello.

06:01.069 --> 06:03.697
I need to make a little
announcement. Just a...

06:03.697 --> 06:07.242
-What kind of announcement?
-Very important one. Seriously!

06:07.242 --> 06:10.411
-[laughs] All right.
-Thank you, Trudy!

06:10.411 --> 06:14.373
Check, check. What's up,
homies of Xavier Academy?

06:14.373 --> 06:17.418
Mr. D in the house,
in the school.

06:17.418 --> 06:21.631
This is an emergency, emergency
announcement. Pay attention.

06:21.631 --> 06:26.261
Please stop. Listen, this
is an emergency announcement.

06:26.261 --> 06:29.890
Today, after school in the gym,
there will be a grade 5/6

06:29.890 --> 06:33.185
girls basketball tryout in the
school after with me the coach,
I'm the new coach of the team.

06:33.185 --> 06:38.439
[garbled speech]

06:38.439 --> 06:41.360
-After school, I'm excited!
-Give me that!

06:41.360 --> 06:44.154
-Thank you.
-That was some emergency!

06:44.154 --> 06:46.781
I just hope Principal Callaghan
didn't hear that!

06:46.781 --> 06:49.284
And if he didn't,
I might have to tell him.

06:49.284 --> 06:53.747
-What's it gonna cost
to keep your silence?
-Here!

06:53.747 --> 06:56.666
"This Friday McGillicuddy's, an
evening with Sleetwood Knack."

06:56.666 --> 07:01.296
Fleetwood Mac tribute band.
♪ Lead vocals ♪

07:01.296 --> 07:04.966
I'll tell you what.
You bring a friend, and your
secret's safe with me.

07:04.966 --> 07:08.887
You know what? I think
you should just tell him.

07:08.887 --> 07:13.892
I'm sorry about bothering you.
Sleetwood Knack. [laughs]

07:20.148 --> 07:23.651
-[blows whistle]
-Bring it in please.

07:23.651 --> 07:26.280
Hello, hello, hello, ladies!

07:26.280 --> 07:29.866
Might wanna get a strap
for those.

07:29.866 --> 07:32.452
This is gonna be fun. Let me
tell you how my tryouts work.

07:32.452 --> 07:36.081
You may notice three
large cutouts that look
distinctly like me.

07:36.081 --> 07:39.542
That's because they are me,
from when I was in high school

07:39.542 --> 07:44.798
where I played a lot of high
school intramural basketball.

07:44.798 --> 07:49.219
This is how the tryouts work.
If you are not as tall
as the first Mr. D,

07:49.219 --> 07:51.263
then you... OK, exactly.

07:51.263 --> 07:54.349
No, you unfortunately,
I'm sorry.

07:56.601 --> 08:01.356
I gotta cut you.
You are not even close
to that size, OK?

08:01.356 --> 08:03.233
All right? Why don't you go down
the hall and audition for Annie?

08:03.233 --> 08:07.321
OK? The sun will
come out tomorrow, OK?

08:07.321 --> 08:11.074
Let's give her a hand.
She got cut, but she
got cut with dignity.

08:11.074 --> 08:13.201
So that's good,
she handled that well.

08:13.201 --> 08:15.536
I like to see that, all right?

08:15.536 --> 08:18.999
UH... Glasses,
let me see you up here.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.793
-My name is Gabby.
-You're now Glasses.

08:21.793 --> 08:26.006
'Cause I give everybody
nicknames. If I cut you,
you can go back to Gabby.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.633
Let's see if you're
as tall here, please.

08:30.093 --> 08:32.553
No, she is not.

08:32.553 --> 08:34.889
Oh! Tippy toes! Good thinking!

08:34.889 --> 08:39.102
Smart, ambition, desire to make
the team, that is awesome!

08:39.102 --> 08:41.688
Everybody have a seat, please.
All right?

08:41.688 --> 08:43.606
I'm going to show you
what I expect from you
in the scrimmage.

08:43.606 --> 08:48.903
Some of this,
a little bit of that,
some of this.

08:48.903 --> 08:51.490
I don't have the right shoes on.
Bring the right shoes.

08:51.490 --> 08:54.909
I forgot mine.
You'll lose the ball.

08:54.909 --> 08:58.872
Come on up here.
Let me see you, please.
Stand by this for a sec.

08:58.872 --> 09:02.417
Put your hand up.
Good! On the team!

09:02.417 --> 09:06.004
Probably the captain.
You ever played basketball?

09:06.004 --> 09:10.008
Doesn't matter.
You are on the team!
You are now Sasquatch!

09:10.008 --> 09:13.053
Come on back up here, Glasses.
I'm going to show you a pick.

09:13.053 --> 09:17.224
This is what we're going to use
to free up space once we know
who our best player is. OK?

09:17.224 --> 09:20.227
Run by me. Go ahead, run by me.

09:20.227 --> 09:23.938
OK? That is a pick.

09:23.938 --> 09:27.484
All right?
Let me give you a hand there,
someone should help her.

09:27.484 --> 09:29.819
That's why you need a strap.

09:29.819 --> 09:36.826
Give her a hand
for participating.
We're gonna have fun.

09:36.826 --> 09:39.246
-[Bill] How was your first day
at school?
-[Gerry] Amazing, actually.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.956
-Now you gotta teach every day,
eh? That sucks.
-It's amazing!

09:41.956 --> 09:45.460
-What are you talking about?
-I get my own class,
I get to coach.

09:45.460 --> 09:48.629
-Who do they got you coaching?
-Grade 5/6 girls basketball.

09:48.629 --> 09:52.217
-Challenging.
-Well, they kind of suck
right now.

09:52.217 --> 09:55.929
Some of the girls are actually
worse than you.
But we'll have fun, I guess.

09:55.929 --> 09:58.473
Worse than me? You can't
even do a left-handed layup.

09:58.473 --> 10:00.600
I told you, I come
from the right side on purpose.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.727
-I don't need to--
-You guys are going to lose
every game.

10:02.727 --> 10:04.687
I guess you're OK with that,
that's fine.

10:04.687 --> 10:06.523
Dude, these are
the players I have.

10:06.523 --> 10:08.066
You could
recruit better players.

10:08.066 --> 10:09.568
Recruit a 12-year-old girl?

10:09.568 --> 10:11.319
What do I, just go to
some online chat room,

10:11.319 --> 10:12.946
-is that what you do?
-Or you could just go

10:12.946 --> 10:14.489
to a school
and introduce yourself,

10:14.489 --> 10:16.741
call her parents.

10:16.741 --> 10:19.660
-Nice! Another cooler!
-Yes, sir.

10:19.660 --> 10:22.205
-Here you go, Geraldine, yeah.
-Rock on!

10:22.205 --> 10:25.292
Gerry, you know that!

10:33.133 --> 10:38.430
-Done!
-Done.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.810
This is Anne Murray Elementary.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.604
I heard a teacher here
got stabbed in the leg

10:45.604 --> 10:48.022
-by a kindergarten kid.
-There she is.

10:48.022 --> 10:50.525
Candice Williams.

10:50.525 --> 10:53.861
Best under 13 player
in the city.

10:53.861 --> 10:56.948
See her?
I'm goin', I'm goin'!

10:56.948 --> 11:01.035
-Yeah, I'm coming.
-No, stay here,
honk if a teacher comes.

11:01.035 --> 11:02.912
That's my job? Honk?

11:02.912 --> 11:05.081
Double honk if it's the cops.

11:05.081 --> 11:07.167
Come here, give me a boost.
Give me a boost.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.876
No, I can't.

11:14.341 --> 11:17.344
[groaning]

11:26.727 --> 11:30.106
Hello, little ladies.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.984
Just wondering
if I could have a minute alone
here with your friend.

11:36.530 --> 11:40.825
It's OK, full-time teacher.

11:40.825 --> 11:44.621
We'll go. For 20 bucks.

11:44.621 --> 11:47.040
Why don't you just go, or else.

11:48.291 --> 11:51.461
OK, 20 bucks, that's fair.

11:51.461 --> 11:53.505
Not a bad deal, actually
for something like this.

11:53.505 --> 11:55.173
Go! Loser!

11:55.173 --> 11:56.383
I'm not a loser.

11:56.383 --> 11:57.592
Show me the ball, Candice.

11:57.592 --> 11:59.219
That's right, I know your name.

11:59.219 --> 12:02.347
How would you like
to learn some of this?

12:09.229 --> 12:11.439
Want to come to Xavier Academy?
Play some ball?

12:11.439 --> 12:14.192
Free ride, coached by moi?

12:14.192 --> 12:17.153
Does he teach at your school?

12:17.153 --> 12:21.491
Does who teach there? Bill,
I told you to stay in the car.

12:21.491 --> 12:24.578
Come on!
You made me lose the ball.

12:24.578 --> 12:26.413
It'll be cool
if he taught at your school.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.122
Hey! Hey, you!

12:28.122 --> 12:30.083
Tell your parents
I'm going to call them.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.877
Bill, let's go, code red!
Let's go.

12:32.877 --> 12:35.589
Your one job
was to honk the horn!

12:35.589 --> 12:38.841
Hurry! Nice!

12:38.841 --> 12:41.511
-Don't! Come here.
-I'm going to carry you.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.513
-Yeah, yeah, yeah!
-This is embarrassing.

12:43.513 --> 12:45.390
Put me down.

12:45.390 --> 12:47.892
Duncan!

12:47.892 --> 12:52.397
Heard you've been lurking around
Anne Murray Elementary School!
Talking to some grade 6 girls?

12:52.397 --> 12:56.317
Yeah, I was actually,
uh, trying to recruit

12:56.317 --> 13:00.238
a Candice Will-- uh,
Candice Williams, basketball.

13:00.238 --> 13:02.741
-Awesome!
-[sighs]

13:02.741 --> 13:05.201
St. Pat's has been trying
to get her for two years.

13:05.201 --> 13:07.995
Davis will be furious when
he finds out we've got her.

13:07.995 --> 13:10.957
That guy drives me nuts. I will
personally tell him myself.

13:10.957 --> 13:16.087
-You should tell him. Who?
-Principal Davis, St. Pat's.

13:16.087 --> 13:17.964
-Pay attention.
-Yeah.

13:17.964 --> 13:21.926
Hey! Davis! Guess
who's the new number one
ranked private school?

13:21.926 --> 13:24.679
I cannot wait to make that call!

13:24.679 --> 13:28.182
-OK, you seem
a little crazy right now.
-Huh?

13:28.182 --> 13:30.518
I don't think I said anything.

13:30.518 --> 13:33.812
-Right, good. Teach hard.
-OK.

13:37.858 --> 13:42.821
Ren-ai, sound out,
ren-ai, sound it out.

13:47.368 --> 13:50.747
OK.

13:52.248 --> 13:55.876
Who can tell me what
caused the Renaissance?

13:55.876 --> 13:57.629
-Yes.
-Um, a war?

13:57.629 --> 13:59.589
-A war, what's your name?
-Jonathan.

13:59.589 --> 14:03.802
Jonathan. How many people
agree with Jonathan?

14:03.802 --> 14:07.221
You can't vote for yourself.
Nobody? Yes?

14:07.221 --> 14:09.890
I don't think anything
caused the Renaissance.

14:09.890 --> 14:14.521
OK, that's a theory as well,
nothing caused the Renaissance.

14:14.521 --> 14:17.231
All right, open your books,
write this down,
please, for homework.

14:17.231 --> 14:19.818
You can't come in here every day
question, question, question.

14:19.818 --> 14:22.445
I'm not going to spoon-feed you.
You need to do some
of this yourself.

14:22.445 --> 14:24.447
Look this up tonight
for homework:

14:24.447 --> 14:26.825
What caused the Renaissance?

14:26.825 --> 14:29.410
Please make sure
you spell it correctly,

14:29.410 --> 14:30.870
as I have done on the board.

14:30.870 --> 14:34.374
And if you find nothing
caused the Renaissance

14:34.374 --> 14:36.543
when you go home tonight, why?

14:36.543 --> 14:38.378
-[bell rings]
-OK, good.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.962
Now you can go. Thank you.

14:39.962 --> 14:43.842
Potatoes, potato, hanging out
with the potato.

14:43.842 --> 14:47.470
Potatoooo...
fries, salt and pepper.

14:47.470 --> 14:52.475
That's mine, do not steal that.
That is my little...
my little shake that I do, OK?

14:52.475 --> 14:54.561
Let me know if you see
anybody do that, please.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.188
Seriously, 'cause
that's my thing. All right?

14:57.188 --> 14:59.982
I don't want anyone doing that.
OK?

14:59.982 --> 15:01.776
Actually, you know what?
I'm checking!

15:05.196 --> 15:10.660
-Are you hungover?
-[laughs] No, no,
I'm not hungover.

15:10.660 --> 15:13.454
Today was way worse
than I thought.

15:13.454 --> 15:17.083
I mean, I thought
that the kids would like
the fact that I'm prepared

15:17.083 --> 15:19.794
-and really wanting
to help them learn.
-Ow!

15:19.794 --> 15:25.550
I had a seating chart,
and a lesson plan.
They hated me.

15:25.550 --> 15:27.844
You're too by the book,
you're too serious.

15:27.844 --> 15:30.388
Relax, have fun.
Loosen up a little bit.

15:30.388 --> 15:32.014
See what I did when
that kid walked by?

15:32.014 --> 15:33.725
That's the kind of
stuff you do, right?

15:33.725 --> 15:36.352
-They love that.
-That's who I am.

15:36.352 --> 15:38.605
I'm "teachery" you know?

15:38.605 --> 15:42.442
I don't know what else
to be other than structured
and organized.

15:42.442 --> 15:46.112
-Try not to be yourself.
-[laughs]

15:46.112 --> 15:48.615
-Being yourself's not working.
-Thanks.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.533
Trust me.

16:01.001 --> 16:05.506
Did I do drugs
in high school? Not sayin'.

16:05.506 --> 16:08.927
Did I cheat on tests?
Many times.

16:08.927 --> 16:12.847
Did I steal from other kids'
lockers? Never proven.

16:12.847 --> 16:16.100
-But now...
-[knock at the door]

16:16.100 --> 16:20.814
Hi, Mrs. Williams,
nice to meet you.
Hello, Mr. Williams.

16:20.814 --> 16:23.399
Seat right up front. No,
those seats are taken, sorry.

16:23.399 --> 16:29.029
Yep, here you go.
OK, thank you. Welcome.

16:29.029 --> 16:30.573
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.

16:30.573 --> 16:33.200
You said something
about a scholarship?

16:33.200 --> 16:37.330
Yes, the wheels are
in motion, so just sit back
and relax and listen.

16:37.330 --> 16:41.542
And you will see why Candice
should be at Xaviar Academy, OK?

16:41.542 --> 16:46.714
OK... oh, almost forgot. Ta-da!

16:46.714 --> 16:48.466
-Thank you.
-No problem.

16:48.466 --> 16:51.177
OK. I am Mr. Duncan.

16:51.177 --> 16:53.179
That's not what your
kids call me, though.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.514
Mr. D, 'cause it's
easier to say.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.182
Mr Duncan doesn't seem hard.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.392
Not for you, but what
about our immigrant students?

16:58.392 --> 17:00.102
Mr. Duncan, very easy.

17:00.102 --> 17:02.480
OK, what about the really,

17:02.480 --> 17:04.148
really immigrant students?

17:04.148 --> 17:06.442
Like people that speak
the click language?

17:06.442 --> 17:08.695
[clicking] That's Mr. D.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.530
What are our kids
going to learn?

17:10.530 --> 17:12.866
Excellent question.

17:12.866 --> 17:15.284
Besides Marcel and Celine,

17:15.284 --> 17:19.455
who can name the other
two Dion quintuplets?

17:19.455 --> 17:22.000
This guy can!
They'll learn about that!

17:22.000 --> 17:25.712
They'll learn about
our above ground railroad,

17:25.712 --> 17:28.840
the Via Rail,
remember when that was put in?

17:28.840 --> 17:32.719
They'll also learn about
the underground railroad.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.762
OK, our subway system.

17:39.976 --> 17:43.980
Pretty amazing, huh? Principal
would now like to meet you.

17:43.980 --> 17:47.107
I'm afraid, Mr. Duncan,
we're going to keep Candice
in her current school.

17:47.107 --> 17:50.778
What? We're going
to give her a scholarship.

17:50.778 --> 17:54.407
We want our daughter to learn,
and as far as we can tell,

17:54.407 --> 17:58.244
you seem to place a lot
of emphasis on sports
and less on academics.

17:58.244 --> 18:01.581
You don't think I'm smart.
Go ahead, grill me,
ask me some questions

18:01.581 --> 18:04.375
-Excuse me?
-Anything, go ahead,
academic, ask me.

18:04.375 --> 18:06.377
Um, who was the
first man on the moon?

18:06.377 --> 18:08.629
Louis Armstrong.
Lance Armstrong.

18:08.629 --> 18:10.506
I corrected myself,
that counts. Next!

18:10.506 --> 18:11.716
Who was the first US president?

18:11.716 --> 18:13.509
Pass. Next question.

18:13.509 --> 18:15.219
This is silly, Mr. Duncan.

18:15.219 --> 18:16.930
Good luck with the team.

18:16.930 --> 18:20.850
Yeah, you don't get the basket.
That's right.

18:29.567 --> 18:34.447
Gerry!
Where's my little all-star?
I'm gonna call Davis right now!

18:34.447 --> 18:36.866
Sir, no cell phones in school.

18:36.866 --> 18:38.659
We didn't get her, sir,
she's going to St. Pat's.

18:38.659 --> 18:41.454
-What?
-I'm just kidding.

18:41.454 --> 18:44.999
Sorry. Um, she's going
to stay where she's at.

18:44.999 --> 18:48.920
-Why? What happened?
-I don't know, the parents,
they came and they listened

18:48.920 --> 18:51.672
and then they quizzed me
and I don't know,
it happened so fast.

18:51.672 --> 18:55.134
Disappointing, Duncan,
very disappointing.

18:55.134 --> 18:58.054
Now you've made him angry.

19:02.558 --> 19:06.562
You didn't hit the rim.
Stop spinning, Gabby.

19:06.562 --> 19:10.691
Don't dance.
Why would you dance?

19:13.152 --> 19:16.572
-[sighs]
-Hey, Gerry!

19:16.572 --> 19:19.575
I had the most amazing night
tonight with the parents!

19:19.575 --> 19:23.203
I gave them my yearly plan
and they loved the famous
quotations I put up on the wall.

19:23.203 --> 19:25.832
I got famous quotes too.

19:25.832 --> 19:29.543
"Blame yourself."
"We're all really alone."

19:29.543 --> 19:32.171
[laughs] Wow.

19:32.171 --> 19:36.342
I just lost the best
basketball player in the city

19:36.342 --> 19:39.428
and now I'm left
with a cute little ballerina.

19:39.428 --> 19:42.389
We are not going to win a game.

19:42.389 --> 19:46.727
She is cute.
OK, well, maybe you can try

19:46.727 --> 19:52.108
and have a little
bit more fun with it.
Not be so serious and...

19:52.108 --> 19:54.986
Hey, hey, maybe you can just try
and not be yourself.

19:54.986 --> 19:58.072
You know, maybe that'll work.
'Cause yourself's not working.

19:58.072 --> 20:02.326
-[laughs] Trust me.
-Nice play.

20:02.326 --> 20:04.912
-Thanks
-I'm gonna go help her.

20:08.207 --> 20:11.377
-Thanks.
-No problem.

20:12.879 --> 20:17.758
And never give up ever!
That's your saying.

20:21.095 --> 20:23.181
Use the backboard, Glasses.

20:23.181 --> 20:25.432
OK, forget that.

20:25.432 --> 20:27.935
Let's play a game
called Princess.

20:27.935 --> 20:31.313
Your job is to get the
princess to the castle. OK?

20:31.313 --> 20:34.734
And it's a Chinese princess.
How's that? But...

20:34.734 --> 20:39.072
...there's also
a mean dragon, also Chinese.

20:39.072 --> 20:41.615
-Played by me.
-But you're not Chinese.

20:41.615 --> 20:44.202
Yeah, but that's just the game,
that's the way the game is.

20:44.202 --> 20:46.370
So, here we go, are you ready?
All right, Glasses.

20:46.370 --> 20:49.623
Let's see if you can get by me,
get by me, get by the dragon.

20:49.623 --> 20:54.087
Nope. OK, she's dead,
don't touch her.

20:54.087 --> 20:57.381
CPR. OK, let's try it again.

20:57.381 --> 21:01.552
OK, mean dragon,
but this dragon's not so mean.

21:01.552 --> 21:06.348
This is a nice dragon, that's
going to lift the princess up.

21:06.348 --> 21:10.310
-There you go!
-I did it! Yes, yes, yes!

21:10.310 --> 21:13.606
OK, but I helped you, though.
I can't lift you
during the game.

21:13.606 --> 21:16.192
-Come here, Gabby.
-I have to go now, sir.

21:16.192 --> 21:19.319
-I see you got a strap!
-See you at practice tomorrow,
sir.

21:19.319 --> 21:22.240
See you, Strap.
That's your new nickname, Strap.

21:22.240 --> 21:24.283
I got something for you, OK?

21:24.283 --> 21:28.246
Sing-dan-fai-lo...

21:28.246 --> 21:30.623
to my song-li-fai-lo...

21:30.623 --> 21:34.085
I don't know,
I don't speak Chinese.
What does that mean?

21:34.085 --> 21:36.879
Merry Christmas
and happy New Year.

21:36.879 --> 21:38.380
But it's not either of them.

21:38.380 --> 21:41.926
Yeah, but it's coming, so...
Potato?

21:41.926 --> 21:43.594
I really have to go now.
Bye, sir!

21:43.594 --> 21:45.638
You could potato,
it takes two seconds

21:45.638 --> 21:47.223
for fries and, uh...

21:47.223 --> 21:49.183
I could still cut you!
