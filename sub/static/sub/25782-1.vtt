00:06.070 --> 00:08.020
Previously on Get Shorty...

00:08.039 --> 00:09.220
How hard can it be?

00:09.650 --> 00:10.714
Producing a movie.

00:10.725 --> 00:12.428
We don't know the first fucking thing.

00:12.444 --> 00:13.531
So we find someone who does.

00:13.571 --> 00:14.594
Mr. Moreweather.

00:14.642 --> 00:16.180
I'd produce this myself,
but I've never done it before.

00:16.200 --> 00:20.050
So, I do the legwork, you advise
me and we split the profits.

00:20.070 --> 00:21.070
What's it called?

00:21.090 --> 00:22.210
The Admiral's Mistress.

00:22.230 --> 00:24.150
And Escalones is producing this thing?

00:24.170 --> 00:26.060
You come to my room tonight.

00:26.080 --> 00:28.050
It's been a few days.

00:28.070 --> 00:30.130
You have nothing we
could use against her in court.

00:30.150 --> 00:33.020
We believe you could be
useful down the road.

00:33.040 --> 00:35.140
- What are we talking about?
- A wire.

00:36.190 --> 00:38.220
So, you've never had sex?

00:39.000 --> 00:40.050
That is correct.

00:40.070 --> 00:42.030
It is a gray area.

00:42.050 --> 00:44.100
Kids call it "soaking."

00:45.010 --> 00:46.070
So, how is LA?

00:47.080 --> 00:48.220
I hear it's a dangerous place.

00:49.210 --> 00:51.140
You think that's true?

00:51.160 --> 00:52.220
Is that a threat?

00:54.000 --> 00:54.220
Was it?

01:01.160 --> 01:03.070
Hope you know it's nothing personal.

01:03.090 --> 01:05.019
I told my Tia, me and Miles,

01:05.040 --> 01:06.190
we can put this behind us.

01:10.160 --> 01:13.020
- Hi, Bliz.
- We're businessmen.

01:13.040 --> 01:16.060
- It as just business.
- That's exactly how I feel.

01:17.180 --> 01:19.220
You've always worked
with people like this?

01:20.180 --> 01:22.000
For a while now.

01:22.020 --> 01:25.050
So you've been lying to me,
basically, my whole life.

01:25.070 --> 01:27.080
I need you to stay away from us.

01:27.100 --> 01:28.160
I'll still see Emma.

01:28.180 --> 01:30.210
Of course,
I've known for a little while.

01:32.090 --> 01:33.150
Miles?

01:33.170 --> 01:36.050
- Speaking.
- Hey, it's Wes from MGM.

01:36.070 --> 01:37.190
I have a script.

01:37.210 --> 01:39.150
And we're looking for a producer.

01:39.170 --> 01:41.020
I was wondering if you
wanted to give it a read.

01:41.040 --> 01:42.070
What made you think of me?

01:42.090 --> 01:45.080
We need someone persuasive.

01:45.100 --> 01:47.150
Well, I can be very fucking persuasive.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.074

02:09.180 --> 02:13.080
Deputy Reiger here on the 161
near the bypass.

02:13.100 --> 02:16.010
Got an 11-83.

02:16.030 --> 02:18.000
11-83 copy.

02:18.020 --> 02:20.170
Do you need me to send an
ambulance out to your location?

02:21.230 --> 02:23.080
Stand by.

02:35.150 --> 02:37.130
- Anyone hurt?
- Nope.

02:37.150 --> 02:39.010
We're all fine.

02:39.030 --> 02:41.000
My fault. Didn't see him.

02:41.020 --> 02:43.130
As long as everyone's okay.

02:43.150 --> 02:45.120
Take your hands
out of your pocket for me.

02:48.120 --> 02:49.220
You got license?

02:50.000 --> 02:51.140
Yeah. Do I? Yeah.

02:52.110 --> 02:53.230
That guy say he didn't see me.

02:55.160 --> 02:57.070
How much you had to drink today?

02:57.090 --> 02:58.120
Nothing.

02:59.150 --> 03:01.210
Stay here. Do not move.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.130
I can call you a tow truck.

03:05.150 --> 03:09.070
Nope. Just, uh, swapping out this tire.

03:09.090 --> 03:11.050
It was our fault.

03:11.070 --> 03:14.180
We told him we'd pay for the damage
and gave him our information.

03:14.200 --> 03:16.090
- Hey, lemme get that.
- No, no.

03:16.110 --> 03:17.220
Don't... Please don't bother yourself.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
- He's got it.
- No, I'm a one-man worker.

03:23.030 --> 03:24.030
What's that?

03:26.080 --> 03:27.130
What's what now?

03:54.040 --> 03:55.200
Hold on!

03:55.220 --> 03:59.000
- You ready?
- No! I'm not ready! Hold on!

04:08.090 --> 04:10.040
On the ground now!

04:10.060 --> 04:13.652
Whosever in the RV, we need
you to exit the vehicle

04:13.663 --> 04:15.000
with your hands on the air.

04:16.070 --> 04:18.329
Exit the vehicle!

04:21.180 --> 04:25.040
Yeah, and the thing
that I hate is name-dropping.

04:25.060 --> 04:27.040
- Totally.
- Right?

04:27.060 --> 04:28.070
I mean, you know, I wouldn't talk about

04:28.081 --> 04:30.409
Sean Penn if I'd only met him once.

04:30.440 --> 04:33.010
I'd only bring him up if I
knew him or I represented him.

04:33.030 --> 04:34.120
You rep Sean Penn?

04:34.140 --> 04:36.110
No.

04:36.130 --> 04:37.896
I'm saying that's why
I don't talk about him.

04:37.907 --> 04:39.010
Right. Right.

04:39.030 --> 04:41.090
I mean, I did, uh, I did meet him once.

04:41.110 --> 04:43.040
But that's-that's not the point.

04:43.060 --> 04:45.190
Gentleman over the bar sent
this over with his complements.

04:45.789 --> 04:46.809
Wow.

04:47.010 --> 04:49.110
- Who sent that?
- Uh, at the end there.

04:49.130 --> 04:51.030
Hmm. What's his name?

04:51.050 --> 04:52.120
He said it was Miles.

04:52.140 --> 04:54.190
Miles. No. I don't know him.

04:54.210 --> 04:57.000
Think he's an actor
looking for an agent?

04:57.020 --> 04:58.130
Hmm. Could be.

04:58.150 --> 05:00.080
Oh, he's coming over.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.130
Hello, there.

05:01.150 --> 05:04.010
Hey! We were just discussing this.

05:04.030 --> 05:06.000
Oh, least I can do. Miles.

05:06.020 --> 05:07.020
Helen.

05:07.030 --> 05:09.020
Wayne and I have been trading calls.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.170
Have we?

05:10.190 --> 05:13.100
We met at Zinc. Have you been to Zinc?

05:14.030 --> 05:15.090
Oh, very trendy.

05:15.110 --> 05:16.220
Brussels sprouts, all that shit.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.120
You mentioned that Amy Adams
was a client of yours.

05:19.140 --> 05:21.000
Hmm. Name-dropping.

05:21.020 --> 05:24.150
Now, I'm a film producer.
I have a new project at MGM.

05:24.170 --> 05:27.160
And I told Wayne about it
and he said it's a home run.

05:27.180 --> 05:29.090
Hmm. I don't remember that.

05:29.110 --> 05:30.200
Oh.

05:30.220 --> 05:32.160
Yeah, you said that
Amy would love to read it

05:32.180 --> 05:36.070
and that I should send a copy of
the script over to your office.

05:36.090 --> 05:39.100
Hey, look, uh, maybe
we did have that conversation,

05:39.120 --> 05:40.200
I don't remember, okay?

05:40.220 --> 05:42.210
You were with a different girl.

05:42.230 --> 05:45.210
But let's keep that between us.

05:45.230 --> 05:48.100
Okay, look, I'm having
dinner here, okay?

05:48.120 --> 05:52.020
- So, why don't you try me at the office...
- I did try that.

05:52.040 --> 05:56.050
Okay. Good. Well,
have a good night then, okay?

05:56.070 --> 05:57.230
Listen.

05:58.010 --> 05:59.057
Hey, hey.

05:59.144 --> 06:00.801
Maybe you had a few drinks
and it slipped your mind,

06:01.047 --> 06:03.833
but you don't wanna be known as
a man who won't keep his word.

06:03.945 --> 06:05.099
Do you, Wayne?

06:05.136 --> 06:06.968
Hey, you know what? Get
your hands off of me.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.398
I'm not someone you tell

06:09.413 --> 06:11.110
to fuck off and I just fuck off.

06:11.130 --> 06:13.140
Either you make good on your promise,

06:13.160 --> 06:15.120
or you'll wish you had.

06:17.150 --> 06:20.100
So lovely bumping into you like this.

06:20.120 --> 06:22.020
What are the chances?

06:22.040 --> 06:24.140
Lovely to meet you, Helen.
Enjoy your champagne.

06:24.160 --> 06:26.418
Let me know how Amy finds the script.

06:33.060 --> 06:36.220
...using as a plan A and we have a B...

06:37.000 --> 06:38.200
Am I late? I thought we were...

06:38.220 --> 06:41.160
No, we're just catching up
with Agent Dillard.

06:41.180 --> 06:43.130
- Hi.
- Oh.

06:43.150 --> 06:45.050
So, you wanna take us through?

06:46.070 --> 06:47.140
She's familiar with the case.

06:47.160 --> 06:49.060
We're not replacing you.
We're just here to help.

06:55.120 --> 06:56.160
Uh...

06:58.140 --> 07:00.010
Okay.

07:00.030 --> 07:03.040
Our informant, film producer
Rick Moreweather,

07:03.060 --> 07:06.785
he's wearing a wire, but won't
testify against Miss de Escalones.

07:06.796 --> 07:07.866
How useful would you say he's been?

07:08.282 --> 07:10.170
So far, Amara won't discuss business.

07:10.190 --> 07:13.070
Pretty much all they
do is make small talk.

07:13.090 --> 07:16.030
- And have sex.
- Two or three times a day.

07:17.220 --> 07:21.040
These are homicides we think are
tied to Amara or the organization.

07:21.060 --> 07:23.040
Most of the evidence is circumstantial.

07:23.060 --> 07:24.080
These are recent?

07:24.100 --> 07:26.070
Two men in Amara's organization.

07:26.090 --> 07:29.090
Originally, we thought they
were taken out by a rival gang.

07:29.110 --> 07:31.020
Now we're not sure.

07:31.040 --> 07:33.080
So, you've got a case for
laundering but not homicide?

07:33.100 --> 07:36.448
- At least we get her off the street.
- For a few years.

07:36.459 --> 07:39.258
I think you have done excellent work.

07:39.269 --> 07:41.160
But Amara is now in business
with the Capitulo Cartel,

07:41.180 --> 07:44.010
which is potentially a bigger case.

07:44.030 --> 07:45.050
Much bigger.

07:46.564 --> 07:47.594
So we're not moving on this.

07:47.614 --> 07:49.584
It's a fallback position.

07:49.604 --> 07:51.550
We, uh, strike out, we can always bring

07:51.582 --> 07:52.928
laundering charges against Amara.

07:52.939 --> 07:54.394
And who are those other guys?

07:54.414 --> 07:56.564
Miles Daly and Louis Darnell.

07:56.584 --> 07:59.424
They're filmmakers.

07:59.444 --> 08:00.554
Kubrick and Coppola.

08:24.414 --> 08:25.434
Oh...

08:32.534 --> 08:34.424
Are you fucking...

08:48.504 --> 08:49.594
Morning!

08:50.554 --> 08:52.564
Hey.

08:52.584 --> 08:56.474
Did you forget I was here?

08:56.494 --> 08:59.494
Wait, if you're not cool with
this, just, you know, tell me.

08:59.514 --> 09:01.474
I just can't handle stairs.

09:01.494 --> 09:02.564
No, you're fine.

09:06.474 --> 09:08.394
So, who was the girl?

09:09.434 --> 09:10.614
Huh?

09:11.394 --> 09:13.404
Naked girl came out of your room?

09:13.424 --> 09:16.534
She grabbed her stuff and left?

09:16.554 --> 09:17.594
Night before last?

09:18.554 --> 09:20.384
Ten minutes ago.

09:23.434 --> 09:24.494
Huh.

09:24.514 --> 09:27.584
Seriously? You have no recollection?

09:28.504 --> 09:29.564
Uh...

09:31.544 --> 09:33.484
I was in a bit of a mood last night.

09:35.504 --> 09:38.574
Katie wants me to sign
the divorce papers.

09:40.394 --> 09:41.444
Hmm.

09:41.464 --> 09:42.604
When did this happen?

09:43.384 --> 09:47.534
Right after a conversation about
Emma's trip to the science museum.

09:47.554 --> 09:50.454
She was like, uh, "Don't forget
the permission slip.

09:50.474 --> 09:54.434
Also, when you have a minute,
lets get divorced."

09:54.454 --> 09:56.544
- Buddy, I'm sorry.
- No, it's good.

09:56.564 --> 09:59.494
Better than dragging it out.

09:59.514 --> 10:01.584
I... My kingdom for an aspirin.

10:01.604 --> 10:04.454
Yeah, you've been going
through those lately.

10:07.404 --> 10:09.614
Look, I know
that you had a difficult night.

10:10.394 --> 10:12.464
But you've been doing this a lot.

10:12.484 --> 10:13.614
What's that?

10:14.394 --> 10:16.474
Getting blackout wasted.

10:16.494 --> 10:18.464
Says the Mormon teetotaler.

10:18.484 --> 10:20.584
Look, you're going
through some shit, okay?

10:20.604 --> 10:24.494
If there's anything you wanna
talk about, you know, just...

10:24.514 --> 10:28.454
- Katie, the divorce, anything...
- There's nothing to talk about, is there?

10:29.604 --> 10:31.564
I'm late to pick up Emma.

10:35.604 --> 10:38.584
Oh, hey, we got the publicity shoot

10:38.604 --> 10:40.494
for the movie this afternoon.

10:40.514 --> 10:41.564
Yeah.

10:45.454 --> 10:47.444
We were together since last October.

10:47.464 --> 10:49.464
But then she stopped texting me.

10:49.484 --> 10:51.384
I was like, "What?"

10:51.404 --> 10:52.504
'Cause I didn't realize that this bitch

10:52.524 --> 10:54.414
has serious emotional problems.

10:54.534 --> 10:56.474
Yeah?

10:56.494 --> 10:57.584
Definitely.

11:00.464 --> 11:03.404
You and me should go to Casa Mi tonight.

11:03.424 --> 11:07.384
Come on, man.
Wednesday's 18 and over. Hmm?

11:08.544 --> 11:10.404
Come on, man, you never been.

11:10.424 --> 11:12.494
I was there last weekend.

11:12.514 --> 11:14.454
- With who?
- Dicky.

11:15.384 --> 11:16.474
You went with Dicky?

11:18.584 --> 11:20.504
Okay, thanks for inviting me.

11:21.454 --> 11:22.474
Hey.

11:25.514 --> 11:26.604
Pacey called.

11:27.614 --> 11:30.404
We lost the RV.

11:30.424 --> 11:32.524
- What?
- They never showed up last night.

11:32.544 --> 11:35.098
And Pacey found out one of the drivers

11:35.138 --> 11:37.404
shot a fucking cop in Goodsprings.

11:37.424 --> 11:38.594
So, they're in custody.

11:39.534 --> 11:41.484
We lost the shipment?

11:41.504 --> 11:45.444
- I mean, the drivers killed a cop.
- But that's a two month supply.

11:45.464 --> 11:46.604
Three.

11:47.384 --> 11:49.424
This is...

11:51.434 --> 11:52.514
Oh, shit.

11:54.394 --> 11:56.494
- Who were the drivers?
- Gringos.

11:56.514 --> 11:59.404
- All right, we'll get them lawyers.
- We did.

11:59.584 --> 12:01.494
Who did?

12:01.514 --> 12:04.554
Pacey called me,
so, like, I called George.

12:04.574 --> 12:07.434
You were on the call
talking to George and not me?

12:09.544 --> 12:11.584
I tell you who to fucking call.

12:13.434 --> 12:15.564
So, don't get the lawyer?

12:15.584 --> 12:17.594
Yes, get the fucking...

12:17.614 --> 12:20.474
Yes, Gary, because I told you to.

12:23.554 --> 12:25.404
Does Amara know?

12:26.394 --> 12:27.524
Call should come from you, right?

12:33.474 --> 12:34.494
Ricky.

12:35.524 --> 12:37.504
Cami made French toast.

12:38.514 --> 12:40.404
You like that, don't you?

12:42.444 --> 12:43.554
Oh, gosh.

12:43.574 --> 12:45.404
What's the matter?

12:46.404 --> 12:47.544
This toothache all of a sudden.

12:47.564 --> 12:50.574
- Oh, you can't eat?
- It's throbbing like crazy.

12:50.594 --> 12:53.454
No, I-I'll try.

12:53.474 --> 12:54.464
Don't move.

12:54.594 --> 12:56.404
Cami.

13:06.404 --> 13:08.484
Ah, Okay. Mmm.

13:11.574 --> 13:14.524
- You're not having some?
- Oh... No syrup.

13:17.604 --> 13:19.464
- All right.
- Try that piece.

13:19.484 --> 13:21.524
- What?
- That one in the middle.

13:27.574 --> 13:29.444
What is that?

13:30.484 --> 13:31.554
For you.

13:31.574 --> 13:33.504
Wow.

13:33.524 --> 13:35.394
Wow!

13:35.414 --> 13:37.424
That's...

13:37.444 --> 13:40.464
- That's very, very nice.
- Hmm.

13:40.484 --> 13:42.504
- Why would you buy me a car though?
- Why?

13:42.524 --> 13:44.524
- Well, I got the Mercedes.
- Oh, it's too old. I don't like it.

13:44.544 --> 13:46.584
- Don't like it?
- They get rid of it.

13:46.604 --> 13:48.464
- Who did?
- The car people.

13:48.484 --> 13:51.424
- You wanna get in?
- The Mercedes, it's gone?

13:51.444 --> 13:52.594
I mean, this is great. This is great.

13:52.614 --> 13:55.384
- I thought you'd like it.
- Yeah.

13:56.504 --> 13:58.444
Vibrant color.

13:58.464 --> 14:00.434
So, w-what was it, a dealership?

14:00.454 --> 14:03.514
'cause I had CDs,
I had a sweater in there.

14:03.534 --> 14:06.514
Yago. You should take it inside.

14:11.424 --> 14:13.614
Thank you for this. It's amazing.

14:20.504 --> 14:23.434
It's open!

14:28.424 --> 14:30.564
Sorry, a bit late.

14:30.584 --> 14:32.444
She'll be right out.

14:32.464 --> 14:33.554
Heard you're going to Don Cuco's.

14:33.574 --> 14:36.484
Yeah. For a nutritious meal
of fried cheese.

14:36.504 --> 14:38.444
That sounds fun.

14:39.424 --> 14:41.404
You look tired.

14:41.424 --> 14:43.404
You're working late, or...

14:43.424 --> 14:45.484
Yeah, you know, now and then.

14:46.584 --> 14:48.574
Hey, did the school call you?

14:48.594 --> 14:51.765
I mean, it's not a big deal, but, uh,

14:51.776 --> 14:53.524
the check you gave them didn't clear.

14:53.535 --> 14:54.681
Ugh, shit.

14:54.713 --> 14:57.454
I-I must have used the wrong account.

14:57.474 --> 14:59.371
'Cause, you know, I was
thinking, there's no reason

14:59.384 --> 15:01.494
that you should be paying
for Emma's school and our rent.

15:01.514 --> 15:03.574
- I don't know why...
- I'm glad to do it.

15:03.594 --> 15:06.404
- Please just let me...
- Katie.

15:07.384 --> 15:08.494
Everything is coming together.

15:08.514 --> 15:10.414
You know, tomorrow we're screening

15:10.434 --> 15:12.534
the director's cut
of The Admiral's Mistress.

15:12.554 --> 15:14.444
Great! That's awesome!

15:14.464 --> 15:17.414
Also, got this new MGM film.
Did I tell you about this?

15:17.434 --> 15:19.394
I'm getting a read from Amy Adams.

15:19.414 --> 15:21.574
- Oh, God, I love her.
- Yeah.

15:21.594 --> 15:23.404
That's gonna be great.

15:23.424 --> 15:25.514
- Congratulations.
- Hey, you hungry?

15:25.534 --> 15:26.816
Does it matter?

15:26.827 --> 15:28.574
Don't need to be
hungry for fried cheese.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.534
- Bye.
- See you later.

15:31.414 --> 15:33.394
Miles.

15:33.414 --> 15:37.474
You know, I got this big raise.

15:37.494 --> 15:38.564
I just explained to you
how well things are going.

15:38.584 --> 15:40.494
Both of your projects sound amazing,

15:40.514 --> 15:43.394
but is there any money coming in yet?

15:43.414 --> 15:45.544
- Because I can...
- Can you fucking let it go?

15:52.434 --> 15:53.574
I wanna take care of you both.

15:55.484 --> 15:56.574
Give me that at least.

15:58.604 --> 16:00.424
Yeah.

16:04.604 --> 16:06.484
I'll be back by 5:00.

16:18.494 --> 16:21.434
Down button, basement level two.

16:21.454 --> 16:22.544
There's a car waiting.

16:30.504 --> 16:32.414
I told Amara that my appointment

16:32.434 --> 16:34.464
would only take an hour, so...

16:35.614 --> 16:37.464
Whose Hummer?

16:38.504 --> 16:40.504
She gave it to me this morning.

16:44.534 --> 16:46.534
Not really my style, but...

16:56.554 --> 16:59.454
Mr. Moreweather, we haven't met.

16:59.474 --> 17:01.514
I'm agent Clara Dillard,
you can call me Clara.

17:01.534 --> 17:03.434
And I see you've already met Ken.

17:03.454 --> 17:05.483
Yeah, okay, what happened to the...

17:05.503 --> 17:07.696
Oh, uh, Agent Buchholz
and Ware are still

17:07.708 --> 17:09.184
on this case, we're
just here to help out.

17:09.200 --> 17:11.444
We wanna make sure
you are being looked after.

17:14.503 --> 17:17.473
So, how are you doing?

17:17.493 --> 17:21.554
- Uh, with the case?
- No, you. How are you doing?

17:21.574 --> 17:24.523
- I've been better.
- Oh, tell us.

17:27.424 --> 17:29.604
Well, for one thing, I'm not sleeping.

17:30.384 --> 17:32.414
Oh, I can imagine.

17:32.434 --> 17:33.554
You're handling it so well.

17:35.394 --> 17:36.564
I'm trying. Yeah.

17:37.514 --> 17:38.504
Hmm.

17:39.464 --> 17:41.414
Jacket.

17:41.434 --> 17:42.464
- Jacket.
- Jacket, yeah.

17:50.584 --> 17:51.584
It's good.

17:55.424 --> 17:57.514
So, this button here...

17:59.434 --> 18:01.404
is a recording device.

18:01.424 --> 18:02.474
Oh, okay.

18:02.494 --> 18:04.464
Even if Amara's people do a scan,

18:04.484 --> 18:06.484
they won't find it, because
there's no transmitter.

18:06.504 --> 18:07.905
But every few days, we'll need to swap

18:07.916 --> 18:09.574
jackets and retrieve the recording.

18:12.474 --> 18:13.534
Well...

18:14.484 --> 18:16.434
Okay, but I, uh...

18:16.454 --> 18:19.494
I have a mustard stain. Just, it
won't come out when you wash...

18:21.524 --> 18:24.424
- Ken.
- Add a stain.

18:24.444 --> 18:25.584
We know how difficult this is for you.

18:25.604 --> 18:29.129
We wanna do everything we can
to make you feel safe.

18:29.140 --> 18:31.070
I appreciate that.

18:31.082 --> 18:33.454
And the agents you've been working
with are very good, but...

18:34.514 --> 18:37.384
Maybe, as a woman,

18:37.404 --> 18:39.707
I could share insights in terms of how

18:39.718 --> 18:42.434
to get Amara to open up about her...

18:42.454 --> 18:44.494
- professional life.
- No, listen.

18:44.514 --> 18:47.544
I don't know about that because
she never wants to talk about it.

18:47.564 --> 18:50.444
Well, let's try doing a role-play game.

18:50.464 --> 18:53.534
You be Amara and I will be you.

18:56.444 --> 18:57.584
You're me?

18:57.604 --> 19:01.514
Amara, it kills me to see you so upset.
Are you okay?

19:01.534 --> 19:03.554
Is there anything I can do to help?

19:07.534 --> 19:09.514
- You're Amara.
- Yeah, I get it.

19:09.534 --> 19:11.564
If you need a shoulder
to lean on, I'm right here.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.484
I know how much you have going on.

19:13.504 --> 19:18.384
Is it... Is it business,
or is it personal?

19:18.404 --> 19:20.584
All right, look, if I say that,

19:20.604 --> 19:24.604
my head ends up in a garbage bag.

19:25.384 --> 19:28.444
We need this case to be airtight
so you don't have to testify.

19:28.464 --> 19:30.474
Or go into witness protection.

19:30.494 --> 19:32.474
Just one second, all right?

19:32.494 --> 19:34.953
Because Buchholz and Ware, they
promised I would never have to testify.

19:34.964 --> 19:37.554
And we really want to keep that promise.

19:37.574 --> 19:41.454
So, you'll be Amara, and I'll be you.

19:42.594 --> 19:44.394
Ready?

19:50.474 --> 19:53.564
- This is nice.
- Yeah, yeah.

19:53.584 --> 19:57.554
So, uh, that's where I stay.
Right under there.

19:58.584 --> 20:01.604
'Cause I'm not so great
with, uh, stairs.

20:02.384 --> 20:03.514
I wanna get my own place though,

20:03.534 --> 20:05.594
as soon as I can get around better.

20:05.614 --> 20:09.394
Yeah, easier to house hunt
when you can...

20:09.414 --> 20:10.564
When you can walk?

20:10.584 --> 20:12.534
Yeah.

20:12.554 --> 20:15.614
So... How about you?
Y-you like living alone?

20:17.424 --> 20:18.484
Why would you ask me that?

20:19.484 --> 20:21.484
- I just...
- I do like it.

20:22.584 --> 20:23.853
Okay.

20:31.604 --> 20:34.414
So, uh...

20:34.434 --> 20:36.604
You said there is something
you needed to talk about?

20:39.444 --> 20:40.584
Not really.

20:40.604 --> 20:42.564
On the phone, you said that
there was something...

20:42.584 --> 20:45.454
Yeah, but you just got out of
the hospital, I'm not gonna...

20:45.474 --> 20:46.604
Uh, I just wanted to say hi.

20:53.444 --> 20:54.544
These flowers are nice.

20:54.564 --> 20:58.524
Yeah, uh, my agent sent those over.

20:58.544 --> 21:00.504
He wants me to

21:00.524 --> 21:02.464
get another writing job.

21:02.484 --> 21:05.464
- Oh, that's exciting.
- Yeah, yeah. So...

21:05.484 --> 21:07.394
Maybe I'll write another movie.

21:08.554 --> 21:09.614
But I don't like meetings.

21:10.394 --> 21:12.534
So I told my agent
that if I can get a job

21:12.554 --> 21:15.454
without having a meeting,
that would be better.

21:15.474 --> 21:17.594
You should, you should take those.

21:17.614 --> 21:20.424
- No, you don't have to...
- We're not flowers guys.

21:20.444 --> 21:22.424
I don't want them!

21:22.444 --> 21:24.544
Okay.

21:31.594 --> 21:34.394
Sir, I'm Detective Torann, LAPD.

21:34.414 --> 21:35.514
Is Miles Daly around?

21:37.424 --> 21:39.424
The quesadillas with chorizo,

21:39.444 --> 21:43.434
and cameranos for sure,
and, and the poblanos.

21:43.454 --> 21:44.584
Dad, I can't eat all that.

21:44.604 --> 21:47.544
You take the rest of it home.
And a steak, thank you.

21:49.454 --> 21:50.604
Oh, and, uh, two horchatas.

21:52.484 --> 21:53.534
It's the best part.

21:56.614 --> 21:59.504
- What were you saying?
- I asked what's going on with you.

21:59.524 --> 22:01.564
Right, yes. Um...

22:01.584 --> 22:04.494
You know, just busy, working.

22:04.514 --> 22:06.504
How's, uh, how's field hockey?

22:07.484 --> 22:09.424
I already told you.

22:09.444 --> 22:12.483
And when I ask what's going on
with you, you won't talk about it.

22:15.404 --> 22:17.404
You pulled out of my movie, Emma.

22:17.424 --> 22:18.977
And now it's coming out.

22:18.988 --> 22:21.564
And I'm betting you don't wanna hear
me banging on about it all day.

22:21.584 --> 22:23.394
You think I made a mistake.

22:23.414 --> 22:24.534
No, no, that's not what I'm saying.

22:24.554 --> 22:26.574
Okay, okay, Dad, I am happy
to hear about it,

22:26.594 --> 22:29.524
but I'm not asking about the movie.

22:31.584 --> 22:33.574
What happened to the guy that shot you?

22:33.594 --> 22:35.434
I never...

22:35.454 --> 22:38.394
- I never said I was shot.
- Do you work for those people?

22:38.414 --> 22:40.594
Shorty, you wanna know
what's gong on with me?

22:40.614 --> 22:43.474
The Admiral's Mistress. That's it.

22:43.494 --> 22:45.404
That's it.

22:45.424 --> 22:48.594
If that's not what you wanna
talk about, then, I'm sorry.

22:48.614 --> 22:51.574
For example, I'm getting
interviewed right after this.

22:51.594 --> 22:54.414
You ever watch the IFC channel?

22:54.434 --> 22:56.524
They're doing a whole feature
on my movie.

22:56.544 --> 22:58.494
That's great, Dad.

22:58.514 --> 23:02.414
It is. Yeah.

23:02.434 --> 23:05.534
You know, you could come
watch if you'd want.

23:05.554 --> 23:07.524
Mom wants me back.

23:07.544 --> 23:09.404
She won't mind.

23:12.564 --> 23:15.414
- Yeah?
- Hey, buddy, um...

23:15.434 --> 23:19.384
I'm at your place and there
is an LAPD detective here

23:19.404 --> 23:20.584
who would like to speak with you.

23:21.544 --> 23:23.564
Is that right?

23:23.584 --> 23:25.494
Yeah, he says that
he would like to get a statement,

23:25.514 --> 23:27.404
but he won't say what's it about.

23:27.424 --> 23:29.534
I'm having lunch
with a pretty girl right now.

23:29.554 --> 23:32.375
Okay, well, I just
thought that this would

23:32.386 --> 23:35.524
probably go easier if you
just talked with him.

23:35.544 --> 23:37.524
Do you mind if I take this?

23:39.474 --> 23:40.514
I'll be one sec.

23:44.534 --> 23:46.464
- Hello.
- Mr. Daly,

23:46.484 --> 23:47.614
this is Detective Torann.
How are you today?

23:48.394 --> 23:49.534
That depends what this is about.

23:49.554 --> 23:52.384
We had a Mr. Wayne Kinnian
file a complaint

23:52.404 --> 23:54.494
accusing you of assault and battery.

23:54.514 --> 23:57.584
Said you confronted him last
night at Lazario's restaurant.

23:57.604 --> 23:59.574
Me? No, that doesn't ring a bell.

23:59.594 --> 24:01.534
You sure he doesn't mean someone else?

24:02.404 --> 24:03.384
Yes, sir.

24:03.404 --> 24:04.554
Mind of I ask you a few questions?

24:07.434 --> 24:08.434
Go on then.

24:16.454 --> 24:20.594
Miss de Escalones, I'm Rafael.
I'll be taking you in.

24:20.614 --> 24:22.584
So do it.

24:22.604 --> 24:26.514
I'm only authorized
to take Miss de Escalones.

24:26.534 --> 24:28.534
Who can authorize for the rest of us?

24:29.494 --> 24:31.574
Afraid that's not possible.

24:31.594 --> 24:35.434
If you don't wish to meet, I can
always relay that to my employers.

24:37.414 --> 24:38.479
I don't like it.

24:39.524 --> 24:42.594
Not gonna stand here and talk about it.
I wanna go in.

24:42.614 --> 24:44.384
This way.

25:02.424 --> 25:04.414
Would you like some sparkling water?

25:04.434 --> 25:06.464
Or do you have a parking
that needs validating?

25:08.464 --> 25:09.474
So nice to meet you.

25:19.424 --> 25:22.404
So, the drivers.

25:22.424 --> 25:23.524
The RV?

25:23.544 --> 25:24.564
We got them lawyers.

25:24.584 --> 25:26.564
The drivers were eliminated.

25:26.584 --> 25:30.514
We apologize for not conferring with
you before we made the decision,

25:30.534 --> 25:32.524
since they were your employees.

25:32.544 --> 25:34.454
But we discussed internally and decided

25:34.465 --> 25:37.524
that their arrest left us exposed.

25:37.544 --> 25:42.494
Also, you asked us to split the
cost of the confiscated product.

25:42.514 --> 25:44.484
Uh, our answer to that is no.

25:46.504 --> 25:48.454
You packed the RV.

25:48.474 --> 25:50.006
You accepted the shipment.

25:50.017 --> 25:53.484
And when the arrest occurred the
RV was 11 miles across the border.

25:57.544 --> 25:59.454
I don't know you.

25:59.474 --> 26:02.404
_

26:05.502 --> 26:08.598
_

26:10.677 --> 26:12.113
_

26:12.243 --> 26:15.393
_

26:15.761 --> 26:18.681
_

26:19.055 --> 26:22.983
_

26:23.831 --> 26:24.881
No.

26:25.629 --> 26:29.327
_

26:30.076 --> 26:32.457
_

26:32.754 --> 26:34.563
_

26:34.732 --> 26:36.304
_

26:39.152 --> 26:41.485
_

26:41.525 --> 26:46.073
_

26:46.743 --> 26:51.100
_

26:51.505 --> 26:54.220
_

26:55.583 --> 26:59.012
_

27:02.321 --> 27:04.988
_

27:08.212 --> 27:10.355
_

28:11.574 --> 28:13.494
Really?

28:13.514 --> 28:15.594
Oh, that's... That's disappointing.

28:17.584 --> 28:19.434
Mmm-hmm.

28:20.584 --> 28:22.474
Uh-huh. Okay.

28:23.544 --> 28:26.404
All right, uh...

28:26.424 --> 28:27.584
Thank you for the update.

28:28.464 --> 28:29.474
All right.

28:32.514 --> 28:36.434
The Kilner piece
has already been optioned.

28:37.554 --> 28:40.414
Did you make the offer?

28:40.434 --> 28:44.394
I was, uh, waiting on legal
to finish our bid.

28:45.584 --> 28:47.394
Sorry.

28:49.384 --> 28:51.464
Corey, would you pull over here?

28:55.464 --> 28:56.464
Thank you.

28:59.434 --> 29:00.524
Nate.

29:00.544 --> 29:05.414
Thank you for the work
you've done over the past...

29:06.544 --> 29:09.494
Well, whatever it's been.

29:09.514 --> 29:12.424
- Laurence.
- Please get out.

29:15.564 --> 29:17.394
Get out here?

29:27.444 --> 29:28.454
Fuck.

29:29.514 --> 29:33.494
First of all, the trailer
is amazing, right?

29:33.514 --> 29:36.454
And I saw a clip of the battle
sequence, it's breathtaking.

29:36.474 --> 29:37.229
I agree.

29:37.240 --> 29:39.494
Flattery gives me this
feeling in my stomach

29:39.514 --> 29:41.584
like I need to use the restroom.

29:41.604 --> 29:44.424
Oh, I should take this.

29:44.444 --> 29:47.544
- Hello.
- It's Emily in Laurence Budd's office.

29:47.564 --> 29:50.584
I know you have a meeting scheduled
with Laurence in a few weeks.

29:50.604 --> 29:54.584
Any chance you'd be able
to meet sooner? Like today?

29:54.604 --> 29:55.802
Today?

29:55.813 --> 29:59.394
Our Executive VP of
Development is moving on,

29:59.414 --> 30:01.614
and Laurence is looking
to fill that position.

30:03.534 --> 30:05.544
Are you still there?

30:05.564 --> 30:07.320
Uh, yeah, I thought this was about

30:07.352 --> 30:09.544
co-productions, not me leaving Gravity?

30:09.564 --> 30:11.564
So, you're not interested?

30:11.584 --> 30:13.554
- I am...
- April.

30:13.574 --> 30:15.394
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.

30:15.414 --> 30:16.434
- Do you remember Emma?
- Hang on a sec.

30:16.454 --> 30:17.564
Of course I do. We've missed you.

30:17.584 --> 30:19.544
- Hey, Emma.
- No, I am interested...

30:19.564 --> 30:21.554
It's good to see you.

30:21.574 --> 30:25.544
Uh, Amara wants to talk.

30:25.564 --> 30:30.424
Um, I need to go and get cleaned
up real quick. Are you okay here?

30:30.444 --> 30:31.614
Can you do me a favor?

30:31.966 --> 30:34.544
Can you just look real miserable
and try not to have any fun?

30:34.564 --> 30:36.414
- Got it.
- Perfect.

30:38.574 --> 30:39.594
What's up?

30:39.614 --> 30:42.404
- What did the detective say?
- Ah!

30:42.424 --> 30:46.524
Fucking talent agent, he said he
gave the MGM script to Amy Adams

30:46.544 --> 30:47.564
and then he brushed me off.

30:47.584 --> 30:49.404
I barely touched the guy.

30:49.424 --> 30:50.484
I should've scared the piss out of him,

30:50.504 --> 30:52.514
then he wouldn't have gone to the cops.

30:52.534 --> 30:55.424
- What did the detective ask...
- I don't wanna talk about it.

30:56.494 --> 30:57.891
Come on.

30:57.930 --> 31:00.564
It's hard to feel like a man when
you're wheeling a fucking walker.

31:00.584 --> 31:04.394
But it's the way that you use
it that I find irresistible.

31:04.414 --> 31:05.584
I think Gladys is gonna dump me.

31:05.604 --> 31:07.594
Were you two going steady?

31:07.614 --> 31:10.454
Maybe just 'cause I don't have
another movie lined up,

31:10.474 --> 31:12.394
and she thinks I'm a one-hit wonder.

31:12.414 --> 31:13.594
You're a no-hit wonder.

31:13.614 --> 31:15.424
She doesn't know that.

31:17.544 --> 31:19.494
Hey. Guys.

31:23.384 --> 31:24.604
- Tell them.
- Yeah, sure.

31:25.384 --> 31:27.544
Amara, she wants to know, and, uh, I
think it's a reasonable question..

31:27.564 --> 31:30.544
When can she expect
to recoup her investment?

31:34.554 --> 31:35.604
Movie's not out yet.

31:36.384 --> 31:37.604
- We haven't even seen it.
- Exactly.

31:38.384 --> 31:40.574
Yes, I told her that once the movie
gets released, she'll get paid.

31:40.594 --> 31:44.454
When it's released or will she need
to wait until production costs

31:44.474 --> 31:46.524
are recouped by the studio?

31:46.544 --> 31:48.414
Yeah, yeah, I mean,

31:48.434 --> 31:50.404
once we sell the foreign rights...

31:50.424 --> 31:51.454
Does she need the money right now,

31:51.474 --> 31:52.564
or can she hold on for a bit?

31:54.394 --> 31:55.564
- Ricky, wait outside.
- Sure.

31:56.514 --> 31:57.604
Rick,

31:58.384 --> 31:59.444
your jacket.

32:02.404 --> 32:03.484
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

32:17.404 --> 32:18.454
Hi.

32:22.390 --> 32:23.434
An RV?

32:23.454 --> 32:25.554
$2.6 million in product.

32:25.574 --> 32:29.384
As of today, we have 30 days
to pay our supplier.

32:29.404 --> 32:30.424
I see why that's an issue.

32:30.444 --> 32:31.494
I wish I could help.

32:31.514 --> 32:33.454
What you do is make movies.

32:33.474 --> 32:34.554
When do you make a new movie?

32:34.574 --> 32:36.474
I'm working on that.

32:36.494 --> 32:38.604
When do I get my cut from this next one?

32:39.384 --> 32:40.424
You don't.

32:43.574 --> 32:44.584
What?

32:47.464 --> 32:49.554
You get a return
on movies you've invested in.

32:49.574 --> 32:52.584
We'll have to see if there's
an opportunity to invest.

32:52.604 --> 32:55.584
I never agreed to that, did I?

32:55.604 --> 32:57.464
Not to my knowledge.

32:59.414 --> 33:02.474
Is Miles in... Oh, well, hello.

33:02.494 --> 33:04.564
- Hey, you're ready for your close-up?
- Yes, I am.

33:05.574 --> 33:07.404
I better go.

33:10.534 --> 33:12.544
Max Kisbye's next big screen turn

33:12.564 --> 33:15.474
finds him fighting for the
love of Sofia Borenstein

33:15.494 --> 33:16.594
in The Admiral's Mistress.

33:16.614 --> 33:20.394
As a director, I was drawn in

33:20.414 --> 33:22.474
by the world of our story.

33:22.494 --> 33:25.271
Well, Max and Sofia, they, they put

33:25.326 --> 33:26.454
themselves in the
mindset of that period.

33:26.474 --> 33:27.872
And when you're working with a

33:27.883 --> 33:30.336
director with this level
of creative vision,

33:30.347 --> 33:31.594
you just have to step
the hell out of the way.

33:31.614 --> 33:34.424
The Admiral's Mistress
is due for release this fall.

33:34.444 --> 33:38.414
And for Kisbye fans,
that's not a moment too soon.

33:38.434 --> 33:39.616
So, my history teacher,

33:39.627 --> 33:40.759
- Uh-huh.
- She's totally strict...

33:41.394 --> 33:42.604
But we found out that on weekends,

33:43.384 --> 33:45.444
she's on a roller derby team.

33:45.464 --> 33:47.259
- Your history teacher?
- Yep.

33:48.544 --> 33:51.564
Well, you're getting
a well-rounded education.

33:51.584 --> 33:54.474
You better go in
before your mother yells at me.

33:55.544 --> 33:58.404
- This was fun.
- This was fun.

33:58.424 --> 34:00.514
Thank you.

34:00.534 --> 34:02.524
You know, tomorrow,
we're having a screening.

34:02.544 --> 34:05.484
Gonna watch the whole film,
if you wanna see.

34:05.504 --> 34:07.444
I'm seeing Helen after school.

34:08.484 --> 34:09.563
Is she a new friend?

34:09.583 --> 34:11.464
No, my therapist.

34:14.504 --> 34:16.464
I thought Mom told you.

34:17.464 --> 34:18.603
Why are you seeing a therapist?

34:19.384 --> 34:21.603
Mom just thought it'd be nice
if I had someone to talk to.

34:22.384 --> 34:23.454
You know, about everything.

34:24.393 --> 34:25.454
About you.

34:31.393 --> 34:32.484
Is it helpful?

34:36.514 --> 34:39.464
I told her you lied to me.

34:39.484 --> 34:43.444
And she said that if you don't feel
good about your life or yourself,

34:43.464 --> 34:44.554
and you lie about it,

34:45.504 --> 34:47.474
it's not my fault.

34:48.484 --> 34:50.454
And I should forgive you.

34:56.554 --> 34:58.464
- Good luck at the screening.
- Mmm-hmm.

34:58.484 --> 34:59.554
See you Wednesday.

35:09.604 --> 35:13.444
Sorry, can I get a Guinness
and a Green Spot?

35:14.404 --> 35:15.494
Double, please.

35:16.494 --> 35:18.424
How's life at the big studio?

35:18.444 --> 35:20.414
It is good. We got a lot to talk about.

35:20.434 --> 35:21.574
Yes.

35:21.594 --> 35:23.739
Got a good feeling
about this project, Wes.

35:23.750 --> 35:24.877
Me too.

35:24.910 --> 35:26.870
Hey, what happened with Wayne Kinnian?

35:27.444 --> 35:29.394
Uh, Amy Adam's agent.

35:29.414 --> 35:31.424
He stopped returning my calls. I
heard something about an argument.

35:31.444 --> 35:32.594
Oh, yeah.

35:32.614 --> 35:34.474
Hey, what happened?

35:34.494 --> 35:36.474
Just a bit of a miscommunication is all.

35:36.494 --> 35:38.272
I felt bad about it. I actually just

35:38.283 --> 35:40.594
sent over a gift basket to his house.

35:40.614 --> 35:42.584
To his home address?

35:42.604 --> 35:45.434
Yeah, got the details off the guard
who was filling in at his desk.

35:45.454 --> 35:48.384
There's cheese, lovely bottle of
vino, and the whole nine yards.

35:48.404 --> 35:49.584
Yeah, I mean, I probably would have
sent it to his business address

35:49.604 --> 35:52.584
so he doesn't think you're,
like, messing with him.

35:52.604 --> 35:55.424
But I'm sure it was appreciated.

35:57.404 --> 35:58.604
Ah.

35:59.384 --> 36:00.584
- Cheers.
- It's okay.

36:00.604 --> 36:02.524
- Cheers.
- Oh, yeah.

36:11.494 --> 36:12.524
Gladys!

36:14.414 --> 36:15.604
Thought that was you.

36:16.384 --> 36:17.514
Where are you coming from?

36:17.534 --> 36:20.394
Uh, interview with IFC.

36:20.414 --> 36:23.394
IFC? That was two hours ago.

36:23.414 --> 36:26.464
Yeah, well, you know, I was
just hanging out, 'cause, uh...

36:30.414 --> 36:31.464
I wanted to talk to you.

36:33.464 --> 36:35.494
Okay.

36:39.384 --> 36:40.554
I kind of feel like,

36:40.574 --> 36:45.454
maybe you wanna stop
hanging out with me.

36:45.474 --> 36:48.414
I mean, you haven't said that. And
you don't need to explain it.

36:48.434 --> 36:51.444
I mean, there's plenty of reasons
that two people might not...

36:51.464 --> 36:52.514
Wait.

36:57.434 --> 36:58.554
I'm pregnant.

37:05.484 --> 37:06.564
Congratulations.

37:08.444 --> 37:09.915
It's yours.

37:10.444 --> 37:13.614
I haven't had sex with anyone else.
It's been a slow month.

37:14.394 --> 37:15.564
And that's why
I've been weird around you.

37:15.584 --> 37:17.534
I wasn't sure whether
I was going to tell you, or...

37:17.554 --> 37:20.454
Is this because we were soaking?

37:20.474 --> 37:23.614
Precum. And I'm guessing
as a Mormon, you're pro-life.

37:24.394 --> 37:25.504
Maybe you've got family

37:25.524 --> 37:28.524
- pushing you to have lots of babies.
- I do.

37:28.544 --> 37:30.504
So, I don't mean to be harsh,

37:30.524 --> 37:33.544
but I really don't want your Mormon
opinion on how to handle this.

37:33.564 --> 37:37.484
We've hung out a little, and
you seem nice, but I don't...

37:38.434 --> 37:39.614
I don't know you, and...

37:40.394 --> 37:43.394
I can't get to know you
because we can't date.

37:43.414 --> 37:44.574
Not the way that I think of dating,

37:44.594 --> 37:47.574
because you won't have sex
until you're married.

37:47.594 --> 37:50.494
I was just gonna go
to the clinic and deal with it.

37:50.514 --> 37:53.384
And then, my sister

37:53.404 --> 37:54.454
got in my head.

37:54.474 --> 37:56.414
She said that at my age,

37:56.434 --> 37:58.444
I have geriatric eggs.

37:58.464 --> 38:01.534
Whatever that means. And that
this might be my last chance,

38:01.554 --> 38:03.534
- which is ridiculous.
- Yeah, it is crazy.

38:03.554 --> 38:06.604
Because it is LA and women
have kids in their 50s here.

38:06.889 --> 38:07.896
Yeah.

38:12.534 --> 38:14.434
Anyway, I'm gonna make
a decision about this,

38:14.454 --> 38:18.434
and I will try to keep you
in the loop, okay?

38:18.454 --> 38:20.544
- Sure.
- We'll talk.

38:20.564 --> 38:23.504
- We will.
- Thanks for understanding.

38:30.604 --> 38:32.554
Oh, I wouldn't suggest that's
budgeted wrong.

38:32.574 --> 38:35.424
If there's actually two in there,
they're only pulling out one.

38:35.444 --> 38:37.514
Excuse me. Can I get a, uh...

38:37.534 --> 38:39.534
- What is that?
- Oh, no, thank you.

38:39.554 --> 38:42.414
- Hmm? What's that?
- I have reading to do.

38:44.514 --> 38:45.564
- This?
- Yeah.

38:46.494 --> 38:47.594
Octopus.

38:47.614 --> 38:50.474
- Octopus.
- It's what it looks like.

38:50.494 --> 38:52.544
Uh, can I get you girls another drink?

38:52.564 --> 38:54.509
That's okay. We're good.

38:54.549 --> 38:56.504
Can we get another round
for the ladies here, please?

38:57.454 --> 38:58.524
Miles.

39:00.414 --> 39:01.444
- Amy.
- Amy.

39:01.464 --> 39:03.594
- Monique.
- Amy and Monique.

39:03.614 --> 39:06.394
What's you plan for the evening, girls?

39:06.414 --> 39:08.404
Uh, this is it.

39:08.424 --> 39:11.394
Oh, but this place,
this place closes early.

39:12.494 --> 39:13.834
Myself and Wes here...
Wes is a big shot.

39:13.850 --> 39:14.856
Yeah.

39:14.867 --> 39:16.366
We're gonna go in search of a place

39:16.384 --> 39:18.554
with less fucking suits and wannabes.

39:18.574 --> 39:20.404
- I gotta take off.
- No.

39:20.424 --> 39:22.554
Yeah, yeah, ton of work to do.
Um, have fun.

39:22.574 --> 39:25.494
- I mean, I'm trying.
- Good night.

39:25.514 --> 39:27.614
- Good night.
- Good to see you.

39:28.394 --> 39:29.394
Amara.

39:30.504 --> 39:31.574
Amara.

39:32.534 --> 39:33.564
Amara?

39:35.384 --> 39:36.414
Hey, I got news.

39:36.434 --> 39:38.444
I just made a bunch of calls
this afternoon.

39:38.464 --> 39:42.524
I just got an email back
from a film financing company.

39:42.544 --> 39:44.434
Guy willing to buy your points.

39:45.424 --> 39:46.504
What does that mean?

39:46.524 --> 39:49.454
That means you're gonna get
your money back immediately.

39:49.474 --> 39:51.504
- Huh? That's good, right?
- Ricky.

39:51.524 --> 39:53.404
Yeah. I mean, we'll talk the numbers

39:53.424 --> 39:56.444
after he sees the cut,
but he's gonna, he's gonna...

39:56.464 --> 39:58.564
- Oh...
- Yeah.

40:00.524 --> 40:02.474
Just know that if you would wait

40:02.494 --> 40:04.474
till the movie gets released,
you'd make more.

40:04.494 --> 40:06.604
I need money now. Gotta tell George.

40:11.464 --> 40:12.604
You know,

40:13.384 --> 40:15.604
I'm here, if you ever just want to talk.

40:16.384 --> 40:17.604
With the whole
money crunch thing, like...

40:19.474 --> 40:21.404
Is it personal, is it business?

40:24.524 --> 40:25.544
What?

40:29.444 --> 40:30.534
I'm just wondering if...

40:30.554 --> 40:32.554
The business, it's okay?

40:35.444 --> 40:36.564
Yes, it's fine.

40:39.464 --> 40:40.514
Great.

40:41.394 --> 40:42.414
Good.

40:42.434 --> 40:44.534
Good. I just wanna
make sure you're good.

40:45.514 --> 40:48.464
And you are. You are. Okay.

40:48.484 --> 40:49.564
Let you get back to it.

41:02.414 --> 41:03.444
Miles?

41:07.564 --> 41:10.434
Oh! Miles.

41:13.484 --> 41:15.464
What are you doing?

41:16.424 --> 41:17.434
What time is it?

41:19.484 --> 41:20.504
Miles...

41:22.404 --> 41:23.404
Oh.

41:24.424 --> 41:27.464
Yeah. Really had to go, huh?

41:27.484 --> 41:30.384
The bathroom is ten feet away.

41:30.494 --> 41:32.384
Yeah.

41:32.404 --> 41:34.434
Aah! Yeah.

41:34.454 --> 41:36.484
- Shit.
- Yeah, shit.

41:36.504 --> 41:37.604
No, no, no, no, no.

41:38.384 --> 41:40.524
You just go to bed. Go.

41:41.574 --> 41:43.614
- Yeah, just get in the bed.
- Yeah.

41:44.394 --> 41:45.424
Yeah.

41:45.574 --> 41:47.384
Yeah.

41:49.574 --> 41:52.474
No, no, no, Miles, get up.

41:52.494 --> 41:54.404
- Go to bed.
- I just gotta...

41:54.424 --> 41:55.594
Get in your...

41:55.614 --> 41:57.614
I'm just gonna lie down here
for a second.

42:11.474 --> 42:13.434
Okay.

42:15.594 --> 42:19.474
Here you go, you fucking idiot.

42:36.544 --> 42:39.414
Oh! Ha!

42:39.434 --> 42:42.454
Oh, shit. I didn't see you there. Fuck.

42:42.474 --> 42:43.554
Sorry.

42:47.384 --> 42:49.454
Morning.

42:49.474 --> 42:53.604
Amara is grateful for your help
and emotional support.

42:54.384 --> 42:56.444
But outside of people she works with,

42:56.464 --> 42:59.444
she can't discuss casino business.

42:59.464 --> 43:01.564
You don't have a problem
with that, do you?

43:03.434 --> 43:05.444
No. No, I mean...

43:06.394 --> 43:07.484
No. I hear you. Yeah.

43:09.474 --> 43:10.484
Okay, thanks.

43:24.614 --> 43:27.494
Rise and shine, pal. Ooh.

43:27.514 --> 43:29.454
Let's see those baby blues.

43:29.474 --> 43:30.594
There they are.

43:30.614 --> 43:32.474
All right, well...

43:32.494 --> 43:35.544
Now that you've had
a luxurious night of sleep,

43:35.564 --> 43:37.534
you are ready for the day.

43:37.554 --> 43:40.384
Screening's in an hour.

43:40.404 --> 43:41.494
No.

43:41.514 --> 43:43.574
Yeah, yeah. So, if
you need to take a shower,

43:43.594 --> 43:46.434
or wanna get a change of
clothes, now would be the time.

43:46.454 --> 43:49.604
Hey, here's your aspirin.
Here's your coffee.

43:50.574 --> 43:52.434
Lulu, do me a favor, will you?

43:52.454 --> 43:55.474
Uh, throw some ice in the sink
and run the water?

43:55.494 --> 43:56.564
You mean this sink?

43:56.584 --> 43:58.584
The one that you pissed in last night?

44:02.414 --> 44:04.474
Oh, fucking christ.

44:05.494 --> 44:06.574
Hey.

44:07.614 --> 44:10.424
Can't you say congratulations?

44:11.494 --> 44:14.584
'Cause we are about to watch a movie

44:14.604 --> 44:16.444
that we made.

44:16.614 --> 44:19.404
Yeah. And if I'm honest,

44:19.424 --> 44:21.414
I never thought that we'd be here.

44:22.394 --> 44:23.514
You should have some breakfast.

44:23.534 --> 44:25.584
Mmm. Fuck no.

44:29.404 --> 44:30.524
You think Gladys will come
to the screening?

44:30.544 --> 44:33.544
- You are hung up on this girl.
- She's a nice person.

44:33.564 --> 44:35.454
She's easy on the eyes.

44:35.584 --> 44:37.514
She's fun.

44:37.534 --> 44:39.494
She's carrying my child.

44:40.370 --> 44:41.434
What's that now?

44:41.454 --> 44:43.614
Yeah, that's what she told me.

44:47.574 --> 44:49.434
In my experience,

44:49.454 --> 44:52.434
people, they have to have sex
to get pregnant.

44:52.454 --> 44:55.504
Yeah, technically, there was...
Technically, there was no sex.

44:56.584 --> 44:58.434
It's called "soaking."

44:58.454 --> 45:00.564
A man puts his penis in the vagina,

45:00.584 --> 45:02.464
but he doesn't move it around.

45:05.614 --> 45:07.434
He doesn't move it around?

45:09.584 --> 45:11.444
I can see why you never mentioned it.

45:11.464 --> 45:14.444
Yeah, she... I mean, you know, she's...

45:14.464 --> 45:17.424
She hasn't decided
if she's having the kid.

45:18.434 --> 45:19.604
She said she'd keep me in the loop.

45:20.384 --> 45:21.534
Oh, that's big of her.

45:21.554 --> 45:23.474
Hmm. I don't know, I just can't
stop thinking about her.

45:23.494 --> 45:27.384
I mean, I can't...
I'm kind of freaking out, man.

45:27.584 --> 45:29.584
I mean...

45:29.604 --> 45:31.604
She doesn't want me to pressure her

45:32.384 --> 45:33.484
while she's making her decision,

45:33.504 --> 45:36.614
but in my faith,
abortion's a fucking sin.

45:39.414 --> 45:41.524
You don't seem to mind putting
a bullet in someone.

45:41.544 --> 45:43.394
Like that's the same.

45:44.554 --> 45:46.444
I don't shoot babies.

45:49.464 --> 45:53.584
Anyway, look, I mean, it's not
up to me, so... You know...

45:53.604 --> 45:55.544
I'm just gonna put it out of my mind.

45:55.564 --> 45:58.384
This bears further discussion.

45:58.404 --> 46:02.414
- But, uh, I'm gonna...
- Yeah, go shower.

46:09.404 --> 46:11.534
I got an update for you.

46:11.554 --> 46:14.454
'Cause you didn't hear
what Ed said this morning

46:14.474 --> 46:16.424
when I wasn't wearing the jacket.

46:17.444 --> 46:19.594
He said, "Stay out of Amara's business."

46:20.524 --> 46:22.504
So they're suspicious.

46:22.524 --> 46:26.534
As if this... This whole thing
wasn't dicey enough.

46:26.554 --> 46:29.464
From now on, I'm not digging
around for information.

46:29.484 --> 46:31.574
No, if I... If I happen
to be wearing the jacket

46:31.594 --> 46:34.584
when somebody says something,
okay, all right, fine.

46:34.604 --> 46:36.484
Otherwise, you're on your own.

46:40.574 --> 46:45.544
Amara may not be, uh, a good citizen
by most people's standards.

46:46.524 --> 46:47.524
You know what?

46:48.484 --> 46:49.504
She's good to me.

46:49.524 --> 46:52.504
And you got me sneaking
and lying around.

46:53.574 --> 46:58.384
I feel like a, uh,
duplicitous piece of shit.

46:58.404 --> 46:59.554
Not that you would care.

46:59.574 --> 47:01.474
What do you care?

47:06.584 --> 47:09.424
I'm talking into a fucking button.

47:12.444 --> 47:14.504
Well, no, I mean,
as far as screen time goes...

47:14.524 --> 47:15.584
Hey! Here we go.

47:15.604 --> 47:17.524
- The moment has arrived.
- Yeah.

47:17.544 --> 47:19.524
Did he tell you I'm gonna get my money?

47:19.544 --> 47:21.534
Oh, yeah, I found a company
that's gonna buy her points.

47:21.554 --> 47:25.434
That's... That's great news. What
have you got on your legs, Rick?

47:25.454 --> 47:27.604
- It's a gift from Amara.
- Lovely.

47:28.384 --> 47:29.494
Lovely gift they are.

47:29.514 --> 47:31.514
Yeah, they really catch the light.

47:31.534 --> 47:34.454
- Hey, is Gladys here?
- No, she said she couldn't come.

47:34.474 --> 47:36.404
- Not sure why.
- What do they sign ever?

47:36.424 --> 47:39.233
- My beautiful Viking.
- Oh, hey, my friend.

47:39.304 --> 47:40.304
Been a long road.

47:40.320 --> 47:44.494
Oh, I'm so proud of what
we have accomplished, man.

47:44.514 --> 47:46.404
Brilliant writer.

47:46.424 --> 47:48.444
My God, easy.

47:49.494 --> 47:51.434
So, when are we gonna do our next movie?

47:51.454 --> 47:53.504
- Soon or what?
- Yeah.

47:53.524 --> 47:54.594
I'm so excited.

47:54.614 --> 47:56.474
Now take your seat. Take your seat.

47:56.494 --> 47:57.594
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

47:58.384 --> 48:00.394
Break a leg.

48:07.444 --> 48:09.614
Yago, didn't expect to see you here.

48:10.394 --> 48:12.394
My Tia wants me in LA.

48:12.414 --> 48:13.494
Discuss some business.

48:13.514 --> 48:16.434
- Hey, Pee Wee.
- How are you doing, Louis?

48:17.394 --> 48:18.444
I am great.

48:18.464 --> 48:21.524
- Thank you for asking.
- No problem.

48:21.544 --> 48:23.584
You know, I'm excited about the movie.

48:23.604 --> 48:25.574
Hope it lives up to the hype.

48:25.594 --> 48:29.484
I just hope it's as good as the other
English period dramas you like.

48:29.504 --> 48:32.527
I heard things aren't going
so well in Nevada lately.

48:32.538 --> 48:33.538
Oh.

48:33.554 --> 48:35.584
- Yeah? That's what you heard?
- Hmm.

48:35.604 --> 48:40.494
Excuse me, I would
like to take a moment to...

48:40.514 --> 48:43.504
show my love for each and every
one of you in this room,

48:43.524 --> 48:47.504
because this is not my movie.

48:47.524 --> 48:49.534
This is our movie.

48:49.554 --> 48:51.534
Yeah, yeah.

48:53.404 --> 48:56.534
Okay! Let's turn
those fucking lights off!

48:57.514 --> 48:58.544
Let's roll.

49:53.444 --> 49:54.554
- The fuck did you do?
- What?

49:54.574 --> 49:58.554
You fish-eating Scandinavian cumbucket!

50:00.564 --> 50:03.584
You think you know art when you see it.
Are you fucking kidding me?

50:03.604 --> 50:07.444
This is the best movie I made
whether you can see it or not.

50:07.464 --> 50:10.434
When this move wins an Oscar,

50:10.454 --> 50:13.504
I won't be thanking you,
you fucking peasant.

50:13.524 --> 50:15.564
- All right. Fuck!
- Hey!

50:18.414 --> 50:20.494
Enjoy your afternoon!

50:22.454 --> 50:23.504
Chill.

50:27.384 --> 50:28.404
I mean that was...

50:28.424 --> 50:30.434
- Wow...
- You stay out of it.

50:30.454 --> 50:32.394
I'm with Miles on this.

50:32.414 --> 50:34.414
- That was just, uh... I don't get it.
- Unwatchable.

50:34.434 --> 50:36.564
I don't get it, I saw the ocean
battle last week, it was great.

50:36.584 --> 50:38.444
The trailer's great,
then you see the whole film...

50:38.464 --> 50:40.434
It don't make any sense.

50:40.454 --> 50:42.444
The scenes are all jumbled. What's
with all the shots of clouds?

50:42.464 --> 50:45.084
- The voiceovers.
- That was not in the script.

50:45.384 --> 50:46.544
Am I gonna get my money?

50:46.564 --> 50:49.383
Okay, all right, look, nobody panic.
This happens all the time

50:49.591 --> 50:52.329
with director's cuts.
They're always rocky.

50:52.404 --> 50:53.494
W-we recut the film.

50:53.514 --> 50:55.454
Yeah, yeah, Hafdis does not
have final cut.

50:55.474 --> 50:57.404
No, he doesn't. So, let's
just get our notes together...

50:57.424 --> 50:59.604
April, you go to Gravity, and...

51:00.384 --> 51:01.604
What? No?

51:02.384 --> 51:03.494
Uh, yeah, no,

51:03.514 --> 51:05.424
I'm-I'm happy to give my notes,

51:05.444 --> 51:07.494
but in terms of working with the studio,

51:07.514 --> 51:09.534
I'm actually, uh, starting a new job

51:09.554 --> 51:12.414
at Budd E. Boy Entertainment.

51:12.434 --> 51:14.434
Laurence Budd?

51:15.534 --> 51:18.454
- Good for you.
- Thanks.

51:18.474 --> 51:20.454
The timing is unfortunate.

51:20.474 --> 51:22.564
I know, but you're gonna have
Reed Jennings,

51:22.584 --> 51:26.444
he's gonna take over. He's senior
VP at Gravity. He's really great.

51:26.464 --> 51:29.454
So, you know, if you
need anything, he's...

51:29.474 --> 51:31.182
He's gonna be here for you.

52:15.494 --> 52:16.564
Mr. Daly.

52:20.494 --> 52:22.504
Sir, I need you to come
to the station with us.

52:23.464 --> 52:25.464
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

52:25.484 --> 52:26.813
Since you and I spoke, we've obtained

52:26.824 --> 52:28.464
security footage of the confrontation

52:28.484 --> 52:30.414
between you and Mr. Kinnian.

52:30.434 --> 52:32.384
You're under arrest for battery.

52:32.404 --> 52:33.514
Would you turn around, please?

52:43.564 --> 52:46.504
Hey, uh, you know, I'm gonna go

52:46.524 --> 52:48.504
stay at my place tonight, I think.

52:48.524 --> 52:50.604
A lot of work to do the next few days.

52:51.384 --> 52:53.604
- I should probably just get...
- You wanna go, go.

52:58.514 --> 53:00.464
You, uh, you all right?

53:07.464 --> 53:09.474
It's been a hard day for me.

53:10.594 --> 53:12.554
Yeah, the movie.

53:12.574 --> 53:15.394
I do business with people in LA.

53:15.584 --> 53:17.454
Not movie people.

53:22.424 --> 53:23.474
Okay.

53:24.464 --> 53:25.554
They don't respect.

53:28.414 --> 53:30.404
Push me around like a,

53:30.424 --> 53:31.554
like a pequena puta.

53:37.434 --> 53:38.614
Maybe I should be in Nevada.

53:41.424 --> 53:42.534
Come on, I...

53:42.554 --> 53:44.534
I get that all the time.

53:44.554 --> 53:48.564
People just throwing their weight
around and trying to prove something.

53:52.424 --> 53:53.484
You're better than that.

53:55.544 --> 53:57.524
You see, once you get through all this,

53:59.394 --> 54:01.474
trust me, you're gonna
have their respect.

54:43.484 --> 54:44.584
- Thanks.
- Mind driving?

54:44.604 --> 54:46.404
No.

55:07.454 --> 55:10.474
From now on, Hafdis doesn't come
anywhere near the editing room.

55:10.494 --> 55:12.221
I'll tell him myself. You and me, we're

55:12.232 --> 55:13.394
gonna sit down with the editors.

55:13.414 --> 55:16.394
Okay, before we get into all that,

55:16.414 --> 55:17.604
can we just take a moment

55:18.384 --> 55:20.504
and talk about what just happened?

55:21.584 --> 55:24.604
- You were in county lockup.
- For assault.

55:25.384 --> 55:28.384
Okay, maybe that wasn't
a big deal, but...

55:28.564 --> 55:30.584
It's a warning.

55:30.604 --> 55:33.394
From the universe and the city of LA

55:33.414 --> 55:35.584
that you need to take a hard
fucking look at yourself.

55:35.604 --> 55:37.524
Meaning what?

55:37.544 --> 55:39.444
You and Katie are getting divorced.

55:39.464 --> 55:41.267
- Oh, for fuck's sake.
- Okay.

55:41.384 --> 55:44.444
I mean, I can only imagine
how bad that hurts.

55:44.464 --> 55:45.524
But you gotta face it

55:45.544 --> 55:47.604
instead of drinking yourself blind.

55:49.534 --> 55:51.404
You know, you're bringing
these girls home

55:51.424 --> 55:53.404
and you don't even know their names.

55:53.424 --> 55:56.384
I mean, usually, I don't object to that.
It's just...

55:57.484 --> 56:00.394
It's part of a bigger pattern.

56:00.414 --> 56:02.494
- Spending money.
- Why are you worried about this?

56:02.514 --> 56:04.554
Because you have zero income.

56:04.574 --> 56:06.404
Correct?

56:06.424 --> 56:07.604
And you're renting this big place.

56:08.384 --> 56:10.394
You're paying for Katie's house.

56:10.414 --> 56:11.524
Emma's school.

56:11.544 --> 56:14.434
Everywhere you go,
you pick up the check...

56:15.584 --> 56:18.434
You're trying to drive yourself
into the ground, buddy.

56:19.564 --> 56:21.444
I'm not gonna let you do it.

56:31.424 --> 56:32.424
Lulu.

56:34.524 --> 56:36.414
You are absolutely right.

56:37.554 --> 56:40.454
I'm just fucking spinning out, man.

56:40.474 --> 56:41.534
I can't seem to catch a breath.

56:41.554 --> 56:43.504
But those words of...

56:43.524 --> 56:48.564
Honesty, that's what I needed. You
are a true friend. Thank you.

56:48.584 --> 56:50.584
Listen, I know that it's not your style.

56:50.604 --> 56:53.454
I wish you'd come to church
with me sometime.

56:53.474 --> 56:55.384
Like, someday, you know?

56:55.404 --> 56:57.504
Just show up, and see if,
you know, maybe you didn't...

56:57.524 --> 57:00.454
- Where are we?
- Can I borrow this?

57:00.474 --> 57:02.544
What? No, no. Miles!

57:05.404 --> 57:06.614
Fuck! Miles!

57:08.604 --> 57:09.614
Miles!

57:13.454 --> 57:14.534
Miles!

57:16.434 --> 57:17.494
Miles!

57:35.404 --> 57:37.404
- Hey.
- Anyone else home?

57:39.404 --> 57:41.414
Oh, shit.

57:41.434 --> 57:43.414
- No.
- Hello!

57:45.414 --> 57:46.414
Security cameras?

57:47.604 --> 57:50.504
- Do you have any fucking security cameras?
- No.

57:50.524 --> 57:53.504
No, no.

57:53.524 --> 57:55.404
- What's your script about?
- Look.

57:55.424 --> 57:57.404
I'll do anything you want, okay?

57:57.424 --> 58:00.434
Okay, so, tell me
what your script's about.

58:00.454 --> 58:03.554
It... It's a thriller.

58:03.574 --> 58:05.564
Uh, set in Georgia.

58:05.584 --> 58:07.554
It's a mix between The Exorcist
and Gone with the Wind.

58:07.574 --> 58:10.484
Fuck! Oh! Shit!

58:10.504 --> 58:12.524
Oh, shit.

58:13.494 --> 58:15.544
Oh, God!

58:19.504 --> 58:20.584
Wait...

58:20.604 --> 58:23.504
Is this the fucking wine I sent over?

58:23.524 --> 58:25.434
You cheap...

58:25.454 --> 58:27.414
Did you open this before you
had the police pick me up,

58:27.434 --> 58:29.564
or did you save up
for this little celebration?

58:31.544 --> 58:33.524
Cunt.

58:36.494 --> 58:38.524
Now, I'm not a Hollywood
blowhard like yourself.

58:38.544 --> 58:40.474
I'm part of a much bigger organization.

58:40.494 --> 58:43.295
I get locked up, somebody else
is gonna pay you a visit.

58:43.384 --> 58:46.404
And if you are lucky,
the visit will be quick.

58:46.424 --> 58:47.554
You follow me?

58:47.574 --> 58:48.614
Yes.

58:49.394 --> 58:51.594
Now, about that read from Amy Adams...

58:51.614 --> 58:55.454
Yeah, okay, I-I'll give her
the script, okay?

58:55.474 --> 58:57.414
I-I'll tell her it's a great project.

58:57.434 --> 59:00.414
You are the only one with the tenderness

59:00.434 --> 59:03.394
and the inner strength to pull this off.

59:04.554 --> 59:07.454
- Thanks.
- That's what you fucking say to her!

59:07.474 --> 59:10.404
Uh, fine. Yes, yes, yes.

59:10.424 --> 59:11.524
Shit.

59:11.544 --> 59:12.614
We should go.

59:13.394 --> 59:15.514
- What the fuck did you do?
- I handled it.

59:15.534 --> 59:16.564
What?

59:27.384 --> 59:28.614
Lulu, all that stuff
that you were saying

59:29.394 --> 59:31.534
about your church and what-not,

59:31.554 --> 59:33.604
that was beautiful advice.

59:35.554 --> 59:37.464
I'm gonna think on it.
