But the whole body you have

00:16.815 --> 00:19.184
One of my favorite
physical illusions

00:19.217 --> 00:21.219
is the thermal grill illusion.

00:21.253 --> 00:22.655
And you can do it right at home.

00:22.687 --> 00:26.491
I have some hot dog halves
in an ice bath.

00:26.524 --> 00:28.628
I also have warm hot dog halves.

00:28.661 --> 00:32.097
Now what I'm going to do
is marry the halves together

00:32.131 --> 00:35.667
so that they alternate,
warm, cool.

00:35.701 --> 00:37.503
Warm, cool.

00:37.536 --> 00:41.707
When I'm done,
I will have a torture device.

00:41.740 --> 00:45.078
But not one that hurts
your body,

00:45.110 --> 00:49.247
one that hurts your mind.

right together

10:11.976 --> 10:14.980
<i>How will she feel when she
learns it was all in her head?</i>

10:15.013 --> 10:16.882
I want to debrief you
on everything

10:16.914 --> 10:18.116
that we're up to today.

10:18.149 --> 10:21.285
So this is a psychology program,

10:21.318 --> 10:24.856
and this equipment is not
doing anything to you.

10:24.889 --> 10:27.125
This is just a machine
that makes noise.

10:27.158 --> 10:29.894
And that's just a laser pointer
on a lamp.

10:29.927 --> 10:31.362
- For real?
- For real.

10:31.395 --> 10:33.765
- Oh, my God. [laughing]
- You were never in danger.

10:33.798 --> 10:35.442
- We didn't do anything to you.
- Oh, my God.

10:35.466 --> 10:39.170
This is an investigation
in pain anticipation.

10:39.203 --> 10:42.306
- Yeah, that worked.
- I was so scared. [laughing]

10:42.340 --> 10:44.743
I was so close to, like,
going to, like,

10:44.775 --> 10:46.287
just say, "You know what?
I changed my mind".

10:46.311 --> 10:48.147
I was so close to leaving.

10:48.179 --> 10:50.948
You did say that you felt
a prickle.

10:50.981 --> 10:53.151
- Uh-huh.
- How do you feel about that?

10:53.184 --> 10:55.219
Whether it was really
I did get goose bumps

10:55.253 --> 10:57.355
or I was nervous,
which is why I felt it.

10:57.389 --> 10:59.323
I know, as a person, like,

10:59.356 --> 11:00.992
if I think there's going
to be pain,

11:01.025 --> 11:02.126
I'm gonna feel something.

11:02.159 --> 11:03.928
I do still feel, like,
kind of like

11:03.961 --> 11:05.330
a burning sensation on my arms.

11:05.363 --> 11:06.965
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:06.998 --> 11:09.201
<i>The power of suggestion
is so strong</i>

11:09.234 --> 11:12.805
<i>that this subject continued to
imagine a physical sensation,</i>

11:12.837 --> 11:14.939
<i>even after learning
it wasn't real.</i>

11:14.972 --> 11:18.242
The name for the effect
is the nocebo effect.

11:18.275 --> 11:21.813
It's a negative effect caused
by nothing but the mind.

11:21.846 --> 11:23.448
It makes perfect sense,
you know,

11:23.481 --> 11:25.149
the power of suggestion.

11:25.182 --> 11:27.119
I'm shaky just thinking
about it.

11:34.225 --> 11:37.763
Pain and touch are weird.

11:37.796 --> 11:40.299
But what about when touch
straddles the line

11:40.331 --> 11:42.835
between pleasure and pain?

11:42.868 --> 11:44.970
When a sensation makes you laugh

11:45.003 --> 11:47.004
and drives you crazy.

11:47.038 --> 11:48.974
I'm talking about tickling.

11:49.006 --> 11:51.075
<i>Part of what makes you laugh
when you're tickled</i>

11:51.109 --> 11:52.811
<i>is the element of surprise.</i>

11:52.844 --> 11:55.080
<i>Your brain doesn't know
exactly what to expect</i>

11:55.113 --> 11:56.448
<i>or when it's going to happen.</i>

11:56.480 --> 11:59.051
<i>On the other hand,
it's impossible</i>

11:59.083 --> 12:00.818
<i>to tickle yourself.</i>

12:00.851 --> 12:03.788
<i>If the brain knows
where and when and how</i>

12:03.822 --> 12:06.859
<i>you are going to be touched,
you won't laugh.</i>

12:06.892 --> 12:09.027
But professors of cognitive
neuroscience

12:09.059 --> 12:10.895
at the University College London

12:10.928 --> 12:14.165
have invented
the tickle machine.

12:14.198 --> 12:16.267
<i>Subjects sit in
the tickle machine</i>

12:16.301 --> 12:17.936
<i>with their feet against a brush</i>

12:17.969 --> 12:19.471
<i>that is connected to a handle.</i>

12:19.504 --> 12:21.974
<i>At first, when the subjects
turn the handle,</i>

12:22.006 --> 12:24.442
<i>the brush rotates
at the exact same time</i>

12:24.475 --> 12:26.410
<i>resulting in no tickling.</i>

12:26.443 --> 12:29.347
<i>Then the machine is switched
into tickle mode...</i>

12:29.380 --> 12:31.783
[laughing]
<i>Which causes a delay</i>

12:31.817 --> 12:33.461
<i>of less than a second
between when the subject</i>

12:33.485 --> 12:35.454
<i>turns the handle
and when the brush moves</i>

12:35.486 --> 12:36.921
<i>against their foot.</i>

12:36.955 --> 12:39.391
- [laughing] <i>
- This slight change</i>

12:39.423 --> 12:41.067
<i>is enough to prevent
the brain's cerebellum</i>

12:41.091 --> 12:42.927
<i>from predicting the sensation,</i>

12:42.961 --> 12:45.931
<i>thus allowing the subject
to respond to the tickle.</i>

12:45.964 --> 12:47.933
[laughing]

12:47.966 --> 12:49.334
Tickles can be fun.

12:49.366 --> 12:52.336
Pain, not so much.

12:52.370 --> 12:56.441
If you couldn't feel pain,
that would be great, right?

12:56.474 --> 12:58.143
Or would it?

12:58.176 --> 13:01.079
Let's meet Steve Pete.

13:01.111 --> 13:03.447
Steve, I understand
you don't feel pain.

13:03.480 --> 13:05.450
Yes, I was born
with a rare genetic condition

13:05.482 --> 13:08.219
called congenital insensitivity
to pain.

13:08.253 --> 13:10.956
It only affects about 40 to 50
of us around the world with it.

13:10.989 --> 13:12.423
- Only 40 or 50 people?
- Yeah.

13:12.456 --> 13:14.225
So far that we've been able
to find.

13:14.259 --> 13:16.995
And tell me what it means when
you say you don't feel pain.

13:17.028 --> 13:19.464
Pain is used to detect injury

13:19.496 --> 13:21.341
and it kind of sends a signal
to your brain saying,

13:21.365 --> 13:23.836
"Hey, don't do this anymore".
It's an alarm system.

13:23.869 --> 13:26.104
So what happens
with my condition is

13:26.136 --> 13:27.538
we feel what's going on

13:27.572 --> 13:29.408
like if I were to touch
your shoulder,

13:29.441 --> 13:31.018
you would feel me
touching your shoulder,

13:31.042 --> 13:33.011
but if I were to touch
your shoulder in a way

13:33.043 --> 13:36.014
that's painful,
I would feel just a pressure,

13:36.047 --> 13:39.117
and the signal of pain
would not travel to my brain.

13:39.149 --> 13:41.252
- Okay, so you feel everything...
- Everything else.

13:41.285 --> 13:44.422
That I feel,
but you just don't feel pain.

13:44.456 --> 13:46.390
- Yeah. Correct.
- But that could be dangerous.

13:46.423 --> 13:49.360
How did you first find out
that you had this condition?

13:49.394 --> 13:51.330
Well, what happened was
I was teething

13:51.363 --> 13:54.032
and I chewed
part of my tongue off.

13:54.065 --> 13:56.368
<i>So my parents quickly took me
to my pediatrician.</i>

13:56.400 --> 13:58.903
- Wow. Are you ticklish?
- Yes.

13:58.937 --> 14:00.072
- Do you itch?
- Yes.

14:00.105 --> 14:01.539
- Do you like massages?
- Yes.

14:01.572 --> 14:03.507
- Do you take painkillers?
- No.

14:03.541 --> 14:05.277
- What about a headache?
- No.

14:05.309 --> 14:08.913
- What about spicy peppers?
- I enjoy them, yeah.

14:08.947 --> 14:11.950
I mean, I do sense
the burning sensation,

14:11.982 --> 14:13.184
but nothing painful.

14:13.217 --> 14:17.188
What about intestine pain
like gas pain?

14:17.221 --> 14:18.624
That's something I don't feel,

14:18.657 --> 14:22.326
so that kind of ties into
one of my biggest fears,

14:22.360 --> 14:24.162
which is having, like,
appendicitis

14:24.195 --> 14:26.164
or any other type
of internal damage

14:26.197 --> 14:28.432
that I just don't know about
until it's too late.

14:28.466 --> 14:29.935
Is there an upside to this?

14:29.967 --> 14:31.469
I'm sure that people,
often naively,

14:31.503 --> 14:32.947
hear that you don't feel pain...
- Yeah.

14:32.971 --> 14:34.048
- And they think, "Oh, man.

14:34.072 --> 14:35.249
Well, you should become
a boxer".

14:35.273 --> 14:37.276
The only upside to it is, uh,

14:37.308 --> 14:40.011
<i>being that I have had so many
injuries during my childhood,</i>

14:40.044 --> 14:42.514
<i>as I get older, I won't feel
the pain that comes with it.</i>

14:42.547 --> 14:44.081
<i>Other than that, really,</i>

14:44.115 --> 14:45.650
<i>I just try to live
my life normally</i>

14:45.683 --> 14:47.151
<i>as everyone else does.</i>

14:47.184 --> 14:49.420
I cannot describe pain to you.

14:49.453 --> 14:52.290
Just like you can't describe
a color to someone who's blind.

14:52.323 --> 14:54.058
Which is where I run into
my problem

14:54.091 --> 14:56.662
with trying to describe
what not feeling pain is like.

14:56.695 --> 14:58.563
Wow, I'll bet.

14:58.596 --> 15:00.032
Well, Steve,
thank you very much.

15:00.065 --> 15:03.803
This was really,
really fascinating.

15:04.336 --> 15:09.574
<i>So not being able to feel pain
is actually a bad thing.</i>

15:09.606 --> 15:13.411
But likewise, the anticipation
of pain can be bad too.

15:13.445 --> 15:17.482
Just making someone think
that they might be tortured soon

15:17.514 --> 15:19.451
could be a torture device.

15:19.484 --> 15:22.054
<i>The CIA and Guantanamo Bay
are known</i>

15:22.086 --> 15:24.221
<i>for using psychological torture</i>

15:24.254 --> 15:26.692
<i>involving the anticipation
of pain</i>

15:26.725 --> 15:30.228
<i>against prisoners
in the war on terror.</i>

15:30.260 --> 15:34.966
The effects of this type
of torture can last a lifetime.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.467
So what's worse?

15:36.500 --> 15:41.572
Waiting for pain to happen
or the pain itself?

15:41.605 --> 15:43.542
You might be surprised.

15:46.677 --> 15:48.647
<i>We're basing our investigation</i>

15:48.679 --> 15:51.248
<i>on an anticipation of pain
experiment,</i>

15:51.282 --> 15:54.252
<i>conducted at the
University College London,</i>

15:54.284 --> 15:56.254
<i>which gave subject two options.</i>

15:56.287 --> 15:59.725
<i>Option one: Experience
intense pain right away.</i>

15:59.758 --> 16:04.129
<i>Or option two: Anticipate
a lower level of pain</i>

16:04.162 --> 16:06.131
<i>in intervals every few minutes.</i>

16:06.163 --> 16:09.400
<i>Researchers found that the
psychological effects of dread</i>

16:09.433 --> 16:14.139
<i>can often be worse
than the pain itself.</i>

16:14.172 --> 16:16.341
<i>We decided to demonstrate
the phenomenon</i>

16:16.374 --> 16:18.610
<i>by setting up
a fake research study.</i>

16:18.643 --> 16:21.146
We are looking into

16:21.178 --> 16:23.148
the effects of electrical
stimulation on the body.

16:23.181 --> 16:25.550
- Okay.
- It's all completely harmless.

16:25.582 --> 16:27.552
- But it can be unpleasant.
- Right.

16:27.585 --> 16:29.397
So we'll show you
the two settings, all right?

16:29.421 --> 16:32.591
I want to show you first what we
call the light setting, okay?

16:32.624 --> 16:35.127
- Okay.
- You ready?

16:35.159 --> 16:36.594
I guess so.

16:36.628 --> 16:38.330
[buzzing]
Oh.

16:38.363 --> 16:40.132
And then there's
the high setting.

16:40.164 --> 16:42.266
[buzzing]
Ow.

16:42.299 --> 16:44.335
- Okay.
- I don't... [laughing]

16:44.369 --> 16:47.439
All right, so again,
unpleasant definitely...

16:47.471 --> 16:48.774
- Yeah.
- But you're safe.

16:48.807 --> 16:51.409
We call this the low voltage
or light shock.

16:51.442 --> 16:52.610
- Okay.
- Ready?

16:52.644 --> 16:55.047
All right.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.149
[buzzing]
Hmm, okay.

16:57.182 --> 17:00.818
And now we'll show you the
high voltage or higher shock.

17:00.851 --> 17:02.586
Oh, okay.

17:02.620 --> 17:04.288
[buzzing]
Ooh.

17:04.320 --> 17:06.156
- Okay.
- Okay.

17:06.191 --> 17:07.692
<i>Now it's time for our subjects</i>

17:07.723 --> 17:09.359
<i>to make an important choice.</i>

17:09.394 --> 17:11.762
All right, so now that you know
the two differences,

17:11.796 --> 17:14.665
you either can choose choice A,

17:14.699 --> 17:18.670
which is one high voltage shock
every ten seconds for a minute.

17:18.702 --> 17:21.105
- Mm-hmm.<i>
- Will our subjects choose</i>

17:21.137 --> 17:23.140
<i>the higher, more painful shocks,</i>

17:23.173 --> 17:25.175
<i>but get it over with right away?</i>

17:25.210 --> 17:30.315
Or choice B
is one low voltage shock

17:30.347 --> 17:33.417
every ten minutes for one hour.

17:33.451 --> 17:36.221
<i>Or will they choose
the lower shocks,</i>

17:36.253 --> 17:39.123
<i>but be forced to anticipate
the pain for ten minutes</i>

17:39.156 --> 17:41.659
<i>between shocks for a solid hour?</i>

17:41.692 --> 17:44.829
Either way,
you will be here for an hour.

17:44.863 --> 17:47.632
<i>What's worse?
A higher level of pain?</i>

17:47.664 --> 17:49.701
<i>Or having to wait and anticipate</i>

17:49.733 --> 17:51.269
<i>the lower level of pain?</i>

17:51.301 --> 17:52.471
I'll take the long.

17:52.503 --> 17:55.307
I think I'll do the shorter,

17:55.339 --> 17:57.341
uh, more painful one.

17:57.375 --> 17:58.742
Okay.

17:58.776 --> 18:00.612
<i>Now that they've made
their choices,</i>

18:00.644 --> 18:02.314
<i>it's time to see how
our subjects</i>

18:02.346 --> 18:05.182
<i>experience these two options?</i>

18:05.215 --> 18:07.284
<i>The subject who chose
to anticipate</i>

18:07.317 --> 18:10.122
<i>the lower level of pain
during the course of an hour</i>

18:10.154 --> 18:12.757
<i>is seated in the low shock
administration room,</i>

18:12.789 --> 18:14.593
<i>along with our actors,</i>

18:14.625 --> 18:16.161
<i>who are pretending
to get shocked.</i>

18:16.193 --> 18:18.129
Hi.

18:20.565 --> 18:24.236
<i>This subject's hour-long
ordeal is just beginning.</i>

18:24.269 --> 18:26.538
<i>But what about the subject
who chose to get it over with</i>

18:26.570 --> 18:29.640
<i>and take the more painful
shocks right away?</i>

18:29.673 --> 18:32.711
We're starting now.

18:32.743 --> 18:34.311
Here's shock number one.
[buzzing]

18:34.345 --> 18:36.480
- Ow!
- Okay.

18:36.513 --> 18:40.184
<i>Yes, the shock is painful,
but it was her choice.</i>

18:40.218 --> 18:43.587
- This is shock number two.
- [buzzing]

18:43.621 --> 18:45.757
It's really painful.

18:45.789 --> 18:47.858
- Shock number three.
- [buzzing]

18:47.892 --> 18:49.894
- It's half over.<i>
- Exactly.</i>

18:49.928 --> 18:52.631
<i>It may hurt more, but she's
getting it over with quickly.</i>

18:52.663 --> 18:54.432
- Shock number four.
- [buzzing]

18:54.464 --> 18:56.300
Number five.
[buzzing]

18:56.334 --> 18:58.637
Number six.
[buzzing]

18:58.670 --> 19:00.572
Okay, you're done.

19:00.605 --> 19:06.310
<i>Meanwhile, our other subject
is only on shock number one.</i>

19:06.344 --> 19:09.713
[buzzing] <i>
That's one shock down,</i>

19:09.747 --> 19:13.384
<i>five more to go.</i>
[buzzing]

19:13.417 --> 19:15.452
<i>While the pain level
may be lower,</i>

19:15.486 --> 19:17.656
<i>the subject has plenty of time
for the pain</i>

19:17.689 --> 19:21.259
<i>and its anticipation
to occupy his mind.</i>

19:21.291 --> 19:24.361
[buzzing]

19:24.394 --> 19:26.431
Hi, Jerome,
would you come with me?

Tell me about why you chose
the lower voltage choice.

19:33.738 --> 19:36.775
- I guess you're...
less pain, you know.

19:36.807 --> 19:38.210
While you were sitting there

19:38.242 --> 19:40.444
waiting for ten minutes
to elapse,

19:40.478 --> 19:42.714
how did you feel?

19:42.747 --> 19:44.282
<i>It's so quiet in there,</i>

19:44.315 --> 19:46.451
<i>so basically you got
your thoughts.</i>

19:46.483 --> 19:48.819

"Okay, it's coming".</i>

19:48.853 --> 19:51.623

<i>in the original study,

the mental torture</i>

20:00.298 --> 20:01.865

20:01.898 --> 20:05.336
Why did you choose
the higher shock group?

20:05.369 --> 20:08.305
Just knowing that it was over
within a minute,

20:08.338 --> 20:10.674
<i>I think ten seconds
is easier to go along with</i>

20:10.708 --> 20:12.611
<i>and anticipate
what was coming next.</i>

20:12.644 --> 20:14.311
So it's kind of like

20:14.345 --> 20:16.615
ripping a band-aid off,
I guess.

20:16.647 --> 20:18.482
- You'd rather...
- Hard and fast.

20:18.516 --> 20:19.584
- Hard and fast?
- Yeah.

20:19.616 --> 20:21.418
Yeah, yeah.

20:28.826 --> 20:33.664
and pain may be, well, painful,

20:33.698 --> 20:37.002
but we crave touch.

20:37.035 --> 20:40.639
Hugging feels amazing.

Hugging can actually decrease
your risk
