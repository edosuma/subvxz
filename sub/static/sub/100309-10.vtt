00:00.130 --> 00:03.340
Previously on "Manifest"...

00:03.340 --> 00:05.640
Oh, no, no.

00:05.640 --> 00:07.720
Bowers: We are very much
treating this fire as a crime.

00:07.720 --> 00:09.390
Detective Stone's firsthand
account indicates

00:09.390 --> 00:11.100
this might have been arson
committed by

00:11.100 --> 00:13.430
a disgruntled member of
the Church of the Believers.

00:13.430 --> 00:15.100
Did they find
the church leader yet,

00:15.100 --> 00:17.360
Adrian Shannon?
Still at large.

00:17.360 --> 00:20.440
You know you have like-minded
friends at the NYPD.

00:20.440 --> 00:22.440
If Michaela Stone
goes on the offensive,

00:22.440 --> 00:23.780
your friends
will have your back.

00:23.780 --> 00:25.450
What happened
to nonviolence?

00:25.450 --> 00:27.660
Michaela Stone
is a threat.

00:27.660 --> 00:29.870
I had nothing to do
with the fire.

00:29.870 --> 00:31.950
You had motive
and opportunity.

00:31.950 --> 00:33.870
No, it's a smokescreen,
and you're falling for it.

00:33.870 --> 00:36.830
Jared Vasquez is an Xer.
Michaela.

00:36.830 --> 00:39.130
Michaela Stone,
you're under arrest for arson,

00:39.130 --> 00:40.880
conspiracy to commit arson,
and homicide.

00:40.880 --> 00:42.710
You are never gonna
live this down, Jared!

00:42.710 --> 00:44.300
You have to
keep your mouth shut.

00:44.300 --> 00:46.180
I just saved your life.

00:51.890 --> 00:52.930
Can I get
some headphones?

00:52.930 --> 00:54.850
Here you go,
sweetheart.

00:54.850 --> 00:56.770
Flight Attendant:
Ladies and gentlemen, we are in

00:56.770 --> 00:59.440
the final boarding process
for Montego Air Flight 828...

00:59.440 --> 01:01.520
Headset, anyone?
I'll take one. Thanks.

01:01.520 --> 01:05.150
...nonstop service to New York.
Welcome aboard.

01:05.150 --> 01:08.240
Amen, amen.

01:08.240 --> 01:10.660
I always say a little prayer
before a flight.

01:10.660 --> 01:12.790
Brings me peace of mind.

01:12.790 --> 01:16.000
My dad was a preacher,
so we prayed all the time.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.670
Stayed up at night praying
God would make me worthy.

01:18.670 --> 01:21.920
You are worthy
in God's eyes.

01:21.920 --> 01:24.710
Not my dad's.
He made that very clear,

01:24.710 --> 01:28.010
so I finally got up
off my knees and walked away.

01:28.010 --> 01:30.640
And I'm still gonna
pray for you.

01:30.640 --> 01:32.760
Yeah, well,
don't worry about me.

01:34.770 --> 01:37.190
Michaela:
They need to worry about Adrian.

01:37.190 --> 01:38.770
I mean, the NYPD should be
trying to find him

01:38.770 --> 01:40.360
instead of trying to pin
the fire on me.

01:40.360 --> 01:42.020
I'm still trying
to get you out.

01:42.020 --> 01:44.070
Need anything?
Water?

01:44.070 --> 01:45.530
No.

01:47.700 --> 01:49.110
-Zeke.
-You okay?

01:49.110 --> 01:51.780
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:51.780 --> 01:53.370
I can't believe
Jared arrested you.

01:53.370 --> 01:54.870
He knows
you didn't do it.

01:54.870 --> 01:56.870
There's something else
going on here.

01:56.870 --> 02:00.040
What?
I don't know exactly, but...

02:00.040 --> 02:02.590
Jared said something.
He said he was saving my life.

02:02.590 --> 02:04.550
I don't care what he said.

02:04.550 --> 02:06.590
His actions have made it
pretty clear that he's an Xer.

02:06.590 --> 02:10.050
He's probably just
covering his ass.

02:10.050 --> 02:11.550
Why do you still
trust this guy?

02:11.550 --> 02:13.850
I don't know. After everything
that's happened,

02:13.850 --> 02:15.180
I shouldn't, but...

02:15.180 --> 02:17.180
But you always see the best
in everyone?

02:23.440 --> 02:27.240
Zeke, when are Saanvi's
treatments gonna start working?

02:27.240 --> 02:30.070
Visit's over.
He needs to go.

02:30.070 --> 02:32.490
Ben and I are getting a lawyer
and getting you out of here.

02:32.490 --> 02:34.780
Hurry.

02:34.780 --> 02:36.080
Jared, talk to me, please.

02:36.080 --> 02:39.210
What is going on?

02:39.210 --> 02:40.870
Just keep your mouth shut.

02:52.300 --> 02:54.510
Ben: Well, that's a relief. Bye.
Excuse me, ma'am.

02:54.510 --> 02:56.930
I don't think
you should be lifting that.

02:56.930 --> 02:58.720
She wants bacon.

02:58.720 --> 03:02.190
And she strongly suggests
you do not get in our way.

03:02.190 --> 03:05.400
Only 29 weeks old
and already running the place.

03:05.400 --> 03:06.820
I love it!

03:06.820 --> 03:08.280
Who was that
on the phone?

03:08.280 --> 03:11.360
Uh, Teresa Yin, the attorney
who got Zeke out.

03:11.360 --> 03:12.780
She's taking on
Michaela's case.

03:12.780 --> 03:14.660
I'm headed there now.

03:14.660 --> 03:16.740
It's crazy to me
that anyone would think

03:16.740 --> 03:18.620
that Mick was involved
in that arson.

03:18.620 --> 03:21.250
The only thing the police need
to focus on is finding Adrian.

03:21.250 --> 03:23.540
But wasn't it Isaiah
who set the fire?

03:23.540 --> 03:25.330
I thought you said Adrian
looked shocked?

03:25.330 --> 03:27.210
He could've conned us.

03:27.210 --> 03:30.260
At the very least,
Adrian created a murderer.

03:30.260 --> 03:32.300
So horrible.

03:32.300 --> 03:36.100
Who would plan
something so --

03:41.560 --> 03:42.890
Man: Help.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.020
Help.

03:44.020 --> 03:47.190
Help me!

03:50.280 --> 03:53.650
"Help me"?

03:53.650 --> 03:56.450
I just had a Calling.

03:56.450 --> 03:57.870
Thanks for the smoothie.

03:57.870 --> 03:59.740
Well, that's what
older sisters are for.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.830
Well, technically,
I'm older.

04:01.830 --> 04:03.500
I was born before you.

04:03.500 --> 04:05.580
Okay, a minute
and a half before.

04:05.580 --> 04:07.710
Eh, it still counts.

04:07.710 --> 04:10.710
How are we gonna explain that
to a baby?

04:10.710 --> 04:13.050
Twins separated
by five years?

04:13.050 --> 04:14.680
The plane disappearing
and coming back.

04:14.680 --> 04:15.800
The Callings?

04:15.800 --> 04:18.890
Voices, visions...

04:18.890 --> 04:20.640
We should make the baby
a guidebook,

04:20.640 --> 04:24.310
sort of like a "welcome
to our weird family" road map

04:24.310 --> 04:26.770
with pictures and captions,

04:26.770 --> 04:28.310
and then when
she gets old enough,

04:28.310 --> 04:29.860
we can read it to her.
What do you think?

04:29.860 --> 04:31.940
Work with
my older-younger sister

04:31.940 --> 04:35.360
to make something for my
younger-younger sister.

04:35.360 --> 04:37.070
I'm in.

04:37.070 --> 04:39.240
And that is why
we need a guidebook.

04:39.240 --> 04:41.990
Let's go get some supplies.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.870
What's going on?
Her lawyer's here.

04:43.870 --> 04:45.500
She's getting out.

04:47.670 --> 04:49.290
But this isn't over.

04:56.840 --> 04:57.930
I've got this covered.

04:57.930 --> 04:59.550
Simon told me to handle it.

04:59.550 --> 05:02.010
I'm gonna offer
to give her a ride.

05:02.010 --> 05:04.520
We'll find ourselves
in a rough neighborhood.

05:04.520 --> 05:05.850
And she doesn't
find her way out.

05:05.850 --> 05:07.190
That plan's not gonna
work anymore

05:07.190 --> 05:09.060
'cause she's leaving
with her lawyer.

05:09.060 --> 05:11.150
Woman:
No, that's correct, ma'am.
Don't worry.

05:11.150 --> 05:13.610
I know exactly how to deal
with Michaela Stone.

05:13.610 --> 05:15.570
-Ma'am, calm down.
-Okay.

05:15.570 --> 05:17.410
But I'm telling Simon
this was your call.

05:17.410 --> 05:19.240
Good.
'Cause it is.

05:23.450 --> 05:24.910
Any of these?

05:24.910 --> 05:27.250
No. It --
It was kind of like this one,

05:27.250 --> 05:28.870
but the shoreline
was rockier.

05:28.870 --> 05:32.000
Alright, "New York, river,
bridge, rocks"?

05:32.000 --> 05:35.720
There was a minaret or something
like that on the opposite side.

05:35.720 --> 05:38.630
Did you hear anything?

05:38.630 --> 05:40.300
A train whistle,
I think.

05:44.100 --> 05:45.640
That's it.

05:45.640 --> 05:46.770
High Bridge.

05:46.770 --> 05:48.480
That's where I was.

05:48.480 --> 05:51.060
Crosses the Harlem River.

05:55.320 --> 05:58.780
I can't get over
how real the Callings feel.

05:58.780 --> 06:02.240
This is exactly
what I saw.

06:02.240 --> 06:06.200
Ben: I don't hear any
cries for help, though.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.960
So, we wait?

06:11.790 --> 06:14.090
It's Michaela.

06:14.090 --> 06:15.130
She's out.

06:15.130 --> 06:16.760
Oh, thank God.

06:19.470 --> 06:21.470
Ben?

06:21.470 --> 06:23.550
Someone's watching us.

06:25.680 --> 06:28.560
No, no, no!
Wait!

06:28.560 --> 06:30.440
Stop!

06:34.070 --> 06:35.150
Adrian.

06:38.750 --> 06:40.190
Where the hell have you been,
you son of a bitch?

06:40.190 --> 06:41.530
The whole world's
been looking for you.

06:41.530 --> 06:42.540
Adrian: I don't
want to be found, okay?

06:43.840 --> 06:45.610
You're a suspect
in a murder investigation.

06:45.610 --> 06:46.860
That's not gonna happen.

06:46.860 --> 06:48.820
Grace:
Adrian? Oh, my God.

06:48.820 --> 06:50.360
We're taking him straight
to the police station.

06:50.360 --> 06:52.860
Wait. This can't be
a coincidence.

06:52.860 --> 06:55.320
What are you doing here,
of all places?

06:55.320 --> 06:57.120
A Calling.

06:57.120 --> 06:58.830
Tried to ignore it,
but it got louder.

06:58.830 --> 07:01.040
Finally gave in. Walked
all the way here from Queens,

07:01.040 --> 07:03.620
dodging cop cars
and traffic cams the whole way.

07:03.620 --> 07:05.750
We can't turn him in.

07:05.750 --> 07:07.420
Are you kidding?
The Calling helped us find him,

07:07.420 --> 07:09.880
and he's got to be
held accountable.

07:09.880 --> 07:12.220
Ben, why would the Calling
bring us together

07:12.220 --> 07:15.970
all the way out here only for us
to bring him all the way back?

08:52.820 --> 08:54.240
And I dug up
some stickers

08:54.240 --> 08:56.070
that I think could help
tell the story.

08:56.070 --> 08:59.660
So, now how are we gonna
explain Callings

08:59.660 --> 09:02.160
to the baby?

09:02.160 --> 09:03.990
What if we just
show one?

09:03.990 --> 09:05.330
Your drawings.

09:05.330 --> 09:09.170
Yes, that's --
that's perfect.

09:09.170 --> 09:12.590
Um, let's find
a happier one.

09:12.590 --> 09:14.170
Yeah, not a lot of those.

09:14.170 --> 09:18.260
True, but they've led
to so many happy endings.

09:18.260 --> 09:20.470
You found Zeke
with this drawing.

09:20.470 --> 09:23.970
And, um, this one,

09:23.970 --> 09:26.480
you helped save those people
under the warehouse.

09:26.480 --> 09:28.770
I guess there were a lot
of happy endings.

09:31.860 --> 09:33.020
What's this one?

09:33.020 --> 09:35.280
It was the first one
I ever drew,

09:35.280 --> 09:38.860
and I actually never
figured out what it meant.

09:38.860 --> 09:41.160
It still kind of
creeps me out.

09:44.580 --> 09:47.750
Okay. Well, let's just go
with this one, then.

09:47.750 --> 09:50.880
And we could add a picture
of Zeke now with Auntie Mick

09:50.880 --> 09:53.000
just to show
how great it all turned out.

10:07.390 --> 10:08.730
Can you please tell me
what's going on?

10:08.730 --> 10:10.060
My mind
is about to explode.

10:10.060 --> 10:11.730
This your first time
back here?

10:13.860 --> 10:14.900
Yeah. You?

10:14.900 --> 10:16.980
While you were...gone...

10:16.980 --> 10:19.150
I came here a lot.

10:19.150 --> 10:22.450
Whenever I wanted
to talk to you, I'd come here --

10:22.450 --> 10:25.200
when I wanted your blessing
to start seeing Lourdes,

10:25.200 --> 10:27.910
when your mom died,
when the plane came back.

10:27.910 --> 10:30.080
I mean, I even came here
when you took me down in court.

10:30.080 --> 10:32.630
Jared, I have to tell you
how sorry I am about that.

10:32.630 --> 10:35.340
And, that time, it didn't
make me feel better.

10:35.340 --> 10:37.550
In fact, it made me
feel worse.

10:37.550 --> 10:39.840
So I walked into a bar

10:39.840 --> 10:43.590
and ended up clicking
with the bartender.

10:43.590 --> 10:46.220
And then I realized I was
in the belly of the beast.

10:46.220 --> 10:47.850
The Xers.

10:50.350 --> 10:53.940
So you joined them
because of me.

10:53.940 --> 10:55.480
I did.

10:55.480 --> 10:56.940
Because the best way
to destroy a hate group

10:56.940 --> 10:58.610
is to blow it up
from the inside.

11:03.990 --> 11:05.910
Oh, my God.
You said you'd never feel safe

11:05.910 --> 11:07.740
with them out there.
You've been undercover?

11:07.740 --> 11:08.870
Why didn't you tell me?

11:08.870 --> 11:10.120
Because I needed you
to believe

11:10.120 --> 11:12.460
I was in so deep
that they'd believe.

11:12.460 --> 11:16.290
It took a lot to gain
their trust, Mick.

11:16.290 --> 11:17.590
The blown police raid.

11:17.590 --> 11:19.920
You were right.
I tipped them off.

11:19.920 --> 11:22.010
I turned you in
to I.A. for that.

11:22.010 --> 11:24.800
You can't help
being a good cop.

11:24.800 --> 11:28.100
You know what the thing
that killed me the most was?

11:28.100 --> 11:30.100
That you bought it.

11:30.100 --> 11:31.810
Yeah.

11:31.810 --> 11:34.060
You were convincing.

11:34.060 --> 11:36.310
Guess you can't help
being a good cop, either.

11:41.530 --> 11:43.490
The bartender,
she's one of them?

11:43.490 --> 11:47.830
No, but she loves her brother,
and he is one of the worst.

11:47.830 --> 11:49.950
You really care for her?

11:49.950 --> 11:52.040
Yeah, I do.

11:52.040 --> 11:55.580
I, um, have to tell you
something.

11:55.580 --> 11:58.340
I bugged her bar.

11:58.340 --> 12:00.050
And I have to tell you
something.

12:00.050 --> 12:01.670
I know.

12:03.880 --> 12:05.800
Okay.

12:05.800 --> 12:08.260
I'm all in.
I want to help.

12:08.260 --> 12:10.760
In the Calling, I heard
a voice yelling for help.

12:10.760 --> 12:12.600
Same.

12:12.600 --> 12:13.890
I tried to ignore it,

12:13.890 --> 12:15.940
but, my God,
the Callings are manipulative.

12:15.940 --> 12:17.730
Says the cult leader.

12:17.730 --> 12:19.190
I created a religion.

12:19.190 --> 12:20.980
Well, your religion
led one of your followers

12:20.980 --> 12:22.190
to murder people
in a fire --

12:22.190 --> 12:23.940
That wasn't my fault!

12:23.940 --> 12:25.700
The Calling was responsible
for that fire.

12:25.700 --> 12:27.030
What?

12:27.030 --> 12:28.700
How exactly?

12:28.700 --> 12:30.530
I got a vision
of a burned-out airplane

12:30.530 --> 12:33.500
with dead passengers everywhere,
and it freaked me out.

12:33.500 --> 12:35.210
So I went to my right-hand,
Isaiah,

12:35.210 --> 12:38.210
told him what I had seen, right
down to the champagne glasses,

12:38.210 --> 12:40.210
and then he made it
all come true.

12:40.210 --> 12:42.590
No, this is on you.
You created a monster

12:42.590 --> 12:45.050
by making Isaiah think
we're all immortal.

12:45.050 --> 12:46.800
The Calling
was warning you to stop.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.550
You don't know that!

12:48.550 --> 12:51.060
You follow
the Callings blindly.

12:51.060 --> 12:52.600
Have you even considered
the possibility

12:52.600 --> 12:55.980
that they create
more bad than good?

12:55.980 --> 12:57.390
No, I refuse
to believe that.

12:57.390 --> 13:00.400
The Callings have saved
so many people.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.320
"Signs and wonders."

13:02.320 --> 13:03.980
Sorry, what?

13:03.980 --> 13:05.650
Where do these Callings
come from?

13:05.650 --> 13:07.070
Do you ever ask yourself?

13:07.070 --> 13:08.660
Only every day.

13:11.080 --> 13:12.870
Grace is right.
You're here for a reason.

13:12.870 --> 13:15.500
Maybe the Calling is trying
to restore your faith.
Ben?

13:15.500 --> 13:17.960
Wish I could believe that.

13:17.960 --> 13:20.380
My water just broke.

13:20.380 --> 13:22.670
It's too early.
Come on.

13:24.670 --> 13:26.090
What am I
supposed to do now?

13:26.090 --> 13:28.010
I don't give a damn
what you do, Adrian.

13:28.010 --> 13:30.390
I've got to get my wife
to the hospital.

13:35.850 --> 13:38.560
Can someone please tell us
what's happening?

13:38.560 --> 13:39.900
Where's Dr. Elbaz?

13:39.900 --> 13:41.770
Away. She wasn't
expecting this delivery

13:41.770 --> 13:43.270
for another two months.

13:43.270 --> 13:45.530
Grace has some
internal bleeding.

13:45.530 --> 13:48.700
It sometimes happens when
there's been a prior trauma.

13:48.700 --> 13:49.780
The car accident.

13:49.780 --> 13:50.950
Is the baby okay?

13:50.950 --> 13:52.120
She's stable right now,

13:52.120 --> 13:53.950
but your blood pressure
is dropping.

13:53.950 --> 13:55.870
What's the solution?
Normally, delivery.

13:55.870 --> 13:57.290
Great,
so let's deliver.

13:57.290 --> 13:59.210
29 weeks is early,
but she'd make it, right?

13:59.210 --> 14:00.580
Unfortunately, we can't.

14:00.580 --> 14:03.130
You have a condition
called placenta percreta.

14:03.130 --> 14:05.920
The placenta has invaded
the surrounding tissue.

14:05.920 --> 14:07.260
That's what has ruptured,

14:07.260 --> 14:09.220
making this
a much more complicated

14:09.220 --> 14:10.800
and more dangerous surgery.

14:10.800 --> 14:12.140
You'd be risking your life.

14:12.140 --> 14:13.760
There are a handful
of specialists

14:13.760 --> 14:15.470
who are qualified
to perform this.

14:15.470 --> 14:16.770
We're trying
to locate them now.

14:16.770 --> 14:18.310
Okay, how long
will that take?

14:18.310 --> 14:19.520
We have calls out.

14:19.520 --> 14:20.770
There's someone
here in town,

14:20.770 --> 14:21.980
but he isn't responding.

14:21.980 --> 14:23.190
We found someone in Boston.

14:23.190 --> 14:24.900
She can be here
in five hours.

14:24.900 --> 14:28.650
Can the baby
hold on that long?

14:28.650 --> 14:30.280
We hope so.

14:47.170 --> 14:48.380
There she is.

14:48.380 --> 14:49.970
It's about time, Stone.

14:49.970 --> 14:51.260
You can hide
behind your lawyer

14:51.260 --> 14:53.010
to avoid questions
about the crime,

14:53.010 --> 14:55.850
but you're damn well gonna
answer questions about your job.

14:55.850 --> 14:57.560
My office, now!

14:57.560 --> 14:59.220
You, too, Vasquez.

15:02.940 --> 15:04.770
And I want to make sure
you're both comfortable,

15:04.770 --> 15:07.520
'cause you're gonna be spending
a lot of time with me.

15:11.570 --> 15:13.910
Welcome to the team, Stone.

15:17.160 --> 15:18.660
Who the hell are you?

15:18.660 --> 15:20.250
What do you want from us?

15:25.540 --> 15:26.840
Man: Help!

15:26.840 --> 15:29.380
Help! Help!

15:29.380 --> 15:32.590
Aah!

15:36.640 --> 15:38.720
Man: Help!

15:38.720 --> 15:42.140
Help! Help me!

15:46.310 --> 15:48.230
Help me!

15:58.990 --> 16:00.540
Jared:
It took me a while to figure out

16:00.540 --> 16:04.080
exactly who was at the top
of the Xer's food chain.

16:04.080 --> 16:05.370
Bowers: Simon White.

16:05.370 --> 16:07.250
Professor at Astoria.

16:07.250 --> 16:08.290
I've met him before.

16:08.290 --> 16:09.670
He's in Ben's department.

16:09.670 --> 16:11.260
He's a classic hate-group
figurehead.

16:11.260 --> 16:12.880
He uses academic credentials

16:12.880 --> 16:15.760
to gain all sorts of followers
in fringe online forums,

16:15.760 --> 16:19.260
meantime tapping uneducated
recruits to start violence.

16:19.260 --> 16:21.350
While keeping
his nose clean.

16:21.350 --> 16:22.930
That's what makes him
so dangerous.

16:22.930 --> 16:25.850
He's convinced himself
that 828ers are terrorists

16:25.850 --> 16:29.940
controlled by evil voices
you all hear in your heads.

16:29.940 --> 16:31.610
Whatever gave him
that idea?

16:31.610 --> 16:34.860
Wild conclusions based on
his own digging around.

16:39.120 --> 16:40.950
Oh, my God.
These are Ben's boards.

16:40.950 --> 16:43.660
His place is to release damning
information about you all,

16:43.660 --> 16:46.290
get other people
worked up.

16:46.290 --> 16:48.500
Incite them
to attack passengers.

16:48.500 --> 16:51.090
Problem is, I can't anything
to stick in court.

16:51.090 --> 16:53.010
Even when he gave
the green light to kill you,

16:53.010 --> 16:55.260
he still didn't say enough
to incriminate himself.

16:55.260 --> 16:57.300
This guy's careful.

16:57.300 --> 16:59.340
So you guys don't have
anything on him?

16:59.340 --> 17:01.760
We could pick him up
on lesser charges --

17:01.760 --> 17:04.600
conspiracy to illegally obtain
your confidential records --
That gives you mail fraud.

17:04.600 --> 17:06.690
Sneaking into Ben's garage?
That's a slap on the wrist,

17:06.690 --> 17:08.480
and you'd have
to blow your cover.
And I'd have to blow my cover.

17:08.480 --> 17:10.730
Is this what it's like
when you two get along?

17:10.730 --> 17:13.400
Yeah, afraid so.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.530
Okay, then. Then let's
put our heads together

17:15.530 --> 17:17.700
and figure out a way
to nail Simon to the wall.

17:19.990 --> 17:21.450
Tamara wants me
to come by the bar.

17:21.450 --> 17:22.620
Go.

17:22.620 --> 17:24.410
Check in with us
in an hour.

17:24.410 --> 17:26.160
Have to keep up
appearances.

17:26.160 --> 17:28.210
Speaking of keeping up
appearances.

17:28.210 --> 17:30.500
And you find
that paperwork,

17:30.500 --> 17:32.960
and you don't come back
until you do!

17:35.130 --> 17:38.840
See? I can be fun.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.340
Oh, my God.

17:40.340 --> 17:41.970
I swallowed
a lot of water.

17:44.640 --> 17:45.970
You're a miracle.

17:45.970 --> 17:48.310
I'm not.
I promise you.

17:48.310 --> 17:51.190
Let's get you
to a hospital.

17:51.190 --> 17:53.520
Look how grumpy
you looked here.

17:53.520 --> 17:55.730
I had been enjoying life
as an only child

17:55.730 --> 17:57.900
for an amazing 90 seconds

17:57.900 --> 18:01.370
until you came along
and stole my thunder.

18:01.370 --> 18:05.660
Well, I was an only child
for 5 1/2 years,

18:05.660 --> 18:07.830
and I prefer
having a sibling.

18:07.830 --> 18:09.750
Siblings.

18:09.750 --> 18:11.250
Yeah. Me, too.

18:14.750 --> 18:16.800
TJ?
Dad.

18:18.880 --> 18:21.970
Hey, Dad.
We're just --

18:27.100 --> 18:32.100
Oh, no.

18:32.100 --> 18:35.360
Okay.
We'll be right there.

18:35.360 --> 18:38.940
It's Mom.

18:38.940 --> 18:40.570
They're on their way.

18:40.570 --> 18:41.910
You want me to call Mick?

18:41.910 --> 18:44.030
Not yet.

18:44.030 --> 18:47.660
I just need it to be
the four of us together.

18:47.660 --> 18:50.910
We're gonna
figure it out, okay?

18:50.910 --> 18:52.330
We're going home together.

18:56.130 --> 18:58.760
What does that mean?
It's the blood-pressure monitor.

18:58.760 --> 19:00.510
Let me go grab the doctor.

19:04.930 --> 19:07.350
I want the surgery.

19:07.350 --> 19:10.600
I don't care who does it
or what happens to me.

19:10.600 --> 19:12.270
I just want my baby safe.

19:12.270 --> 19:13.940
Grace, you could die.
You heard him.

19:13.940 --> 19:16.270
He -- The doctor said --
I'll take that risk.

19:16.270 --> 19:18.900
The minute
our baby is in danger,

19:18.900 --> 19:21.150
we have to get her out.

19:21.150 --> 19:23.410
We have to save her.

19:23.410 --> 19:27.080
It's our job as parents

19:27.080 --> 19:30.250
to take care of our kids...

19:30.250 --> 19:32.660
no matter what.

19:33.830 --> 19:35.880
Promise me.

19:39.340 --> 19:41.590
Uh...

19:41.590 --> 19:44.630
Uh, okay.

19:44.630 --> 19:46.340
Grace? Grace.

19:46.340 --> 19:48.680
Grace? What's happening?!

19:48.680 --> 19:50.560
Excuse me.

19:50.560 --> 19:53.440
Baby's crashing.

19:53.440 --> 19:55.690
Your wife can survive this
with a few transfusions,

19:55.690 --> 19:58.020
but I don't think
your baby will.

19:58.020 --> 20:00.150
She -- She wants the surgery.
I don't advise that.

20:00.150 --> 20:01.900
I have never done
this surgery before.

20:01.900 --> 20:03.990
I understand that.
Can you save the baby?

20:03.990 --> 20:06.490
Yes.
But your wife could die.

20:06.490 --> 20:07.910
Save the baby.

20:07.910 --> 20:09.370
It's what Grace wants.

20:09.370 --> 20:11.540
Just wait
till my kids get here.

20:11.540 --> 20:12.660
Okay.

20:12.660 --> 20:14.620
We'll prep her.

20:21.630 --> 20:23.170
Hey.

20:23.170 --> 20:25.090
Tamara, what's going on?
It's Billy.

20:25.090 --> 20:26.430
What he do?

20:26.430 --> 20:29.510
He's really gone
too far this time.

20:33.020 --> 20:34.640
Look who I found.

20:49.370 --> 20:50.870
Hey.
Gimme your phone.

20:50.870 --> 20:52.910
What?
Gimme your damn phone.

20:56.750 --> 20:59.790
Yo, Billy, man, what the hell?!
He had you in his contacts!

20:59.790 --> 21:01.420
I think
he's been tracking you.

21:01.420 --> 21:04.010
This is the guy

21:04.010 --> 21:07.510
your ex-fiancée threw you
under the bus for, right?

21:07.510 --> 21:09.680
Yeah, how'd you find him?
When your ex got off scot-free,

21:09.680 --> 21:11.970
the three of us
were gonna welcome her home,

21:11.970 --> 21:14.600
but then this guy
showed up instead.

21:14.600 --> 21:16.980
So we roughed him up a little
to send her a message,

21:16.980 --> 21:19.650
and we figured that you might
want to take a crack at him.

21:20.980 --> 21:23.900
Hey, and guess what else
we figured out.

21:23.900 --> 21:26.900
His face is all over
Ben Stone's wall.

21:32.200 --> 21:34.830
You did good.

21:36.500 --> 21:38.080
Come on.

21:38.080 --> 21:40.380
What?
What, where we going?

21:40.380 --> 21:43.420
Just shut up and follow me.

21:43.420 --> 21:45.260
It's weird that Jared
hasn't checked in yet.

21:45.260 --> 21:48.090
He had 60 minutes.
It's been...64?

21:48.090 --> 21:50.550
Exactly. To Jared,
60 minutes is 60 minutes,

21:50.550 --> 21:52.720
unless he can't step away.

21:52.720 --> 21:54.010
So what do you want to do?

21:54.010 --> 21:55.680
'Cause I'm not about
to blow his cover.

21:55.680 --> 21:57.680
Wait, no, no. H-He doesn't
have to check in with us.

21:57.680 --> 21:59.560
We can check in
with him.

21:59.560 --> 22:01.100
I bugged that bar,
remember?

22:01.100 --> 22:03.190
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
that we should listen

22:03.190 --> 22:05.690
to anything that he --

22:05.690 --> 22:07.940
You know you have
trust issues.

I got this, okay?

22:20.290 --> 22:22.580
Just take off.

22:22.580 --> 22:26.090
Seriously, go.

back out here?

23:01.670 --> 23:03.750
Wait.
Sorry, hold on.

right now.

Nah, man. Think about it.

This is not the plan.

26:45.680 --> 26:48.390
Well, we got him now.
Should we just let him go?

26:48.390 --> 26:51.850
The minute we release this guy,
he's gonna call the cops,

26:51.850 --> 26:53.310
and then we'll all
be implicated.

who shot her, right?

enough, not enough

Ben: What do you mean?
Dr. Gutierrez:
This is the specialist

29:43.440 --> 29:45.690
I told you about.
We couldn't reach him.

29:45.690 --> 29:47.900

Dr. Chmait: This is the patient?

29:47.900 --> 29:50.240
Grace, is it?
Uh, yes.

29:50.240 --> 29:53.120
Uh, they said you could save
my wife and my baby?

29:53.120 --> 29:55.080

many times,

29:55.080 --> 29:56.660

has been dropping.

29:56.660 --> 29:57.710
We need to go now.

29:57.710 --> 29:59.290
Yeah, yeah, okay.

30:04.590 --> 30:06.260
You can't come, sir.

30:06.260 --> 30:08.800
Uh, what -- what can I do?

30:08.800 --> 30:10.800
You can pray.

30:21.770 --> 30:24.020

would feel about 828ers

30:24.020 --> 30:28.030
if one of them just stone-cold
assassinated her boyfriend.

30:28.030 --> 30:30.820
They'd lose every ounce
of sympathy.

30:30.820 --> 30:32.240
Then we release all

30:32.240 --> 30:35.740
the incriminating intel
we've gathered.

30:35.740 --> 30:38.120
It would have
a much bigger impact.

30:38.120 --> 30:40.330
You can plant something,
some piece of evidence

30:40.330 --> 30:43.170

30:43.170 --> 30:45.380
Yeah. I can.

30:45.380 --> 30:46.880

and at least two guns.

31:04.110 --> 31:05.770
Could be a powder keg.

31:14.990 --> 31:16.410

31:52.700 --> 31:55.700

31:55.700 --> 31:57.950

Just don't.

33:18.410 --> 33:21.700

33:21.700 --> 33:23.910
No. No, I swear
it's not like that.

33:23.910 --> 33:25.540

I don't know how you kept
your cool through all that.

34:18.090 --> 34:20.890
Well, I may not be hearing
voices in my head,

34:20.890 --> 34:25.060
but I've learned a thing
or two in my years on the job.

34:25.060 --> 34:26.770
Glad it still counts
for something.

34:26.770 --> 34:28.680
It counts for a lot.

34:28.680 --> 34:30.310

I'm gonna need you to stay back.

34:30.310 --> 34:32.860
Active crime scene. Stay back.

34:50.500 --> 34:53.830
Both of those ladies
are prizefighters.

34:53.830 --> 34:55.710
Mom is recovering,
and she'll be able

34:55.710 --> 34:57.340
to have visitors
in just a bit.

34:57.340 --> 34:59.720
Thank God.
Thank you.

34:59.720 --> 35:00.880
What about our baby sister?

35:00.880 --> 35:02.090
Yeah,
can we see her?

35:02.090 --> 35:03.680
She's in the NICU.

35:03.680 --> 35:06.680
She'll be in an incubator
for a bit, like any 29-weeker,

35:06.680 --> 35:10.680
but you should know
she's doing fine.

35:10.680 --> 35:13.150
I-I don't know how to thank you.
If you didn't get here, I --

35:13.150 --> 35:15.310
It was actually something
of a miracle that I did.

35:15.310 --> 35:17.900
I was kayaking earlier today
in the Harlem River.

35:17.900 --> 35:19.610
Lost my balance,
and I flipped over.

35:19.610 --> 35:22.320
Wait.
Harlem River?

35:22.320 --> 35:25.410
Yeah, and a total stranger
happened to be standing

35:25.410 --> 35:28.240
under the High Bridge
at that exact moment.

35:28.240 --> 35:31.660
He jumped in,
saved my life,

35:31.660 --> 35:33.420
and brought me here
for good measure.

35:33.420 --> 35:36.290
This man who saved you,
do you know where he is now?

35:36.290 --> 35:39.050
I asked him to wait in the
lobby, offered him some money.

35:39.050 --> 35:40.420
He may still be there.

35:40.420 --> 35:43.680
Thank you.
You're very welcome.

35:43.680 --> 35:45.260
Come here.

35:59.730 --> 36:02.610
Are they out of surgery?

36:02.610 --> 36:05.070
You did it.
You completed a Calling.

36:05.070 --> 36:07.740
And the man you saved
was the one person

36:07.740 --> 36:10.830
that could save both of them.
They're gonna be okay.

36:10.830 --> 36:12.290
Now, if you needed
any more proof

36:12.290 --> 36:14.710
that the Callings are good,
this is it.

36:14.710 --> 36:17.460
You sure about that?

36:17.460 --> 36:20.710
What put your wife and baby
in danger in the first place?

36:20.710 --> 36:21.920
Grace's water broke.

36:21.920 --> 36:23.170
Why?
Why did it break?

36:23.170 --> 36:24.970
We don't know exactly.

36:24.970 --> 36:26.930
I do.

36:26.930 --> 36:29.720
I saw her fall
near the river. Ask her.

36:29.720 --> 36:31.270
The only reason
she was on those rocks

36:31.270 --> 36:33.020
was because the Calling
told you to go there.

36:33.020 --> 36:35.940
Why would the Callings do that?
Set up dangers just to trick us

36:35.940 --> 36:37.480
into thinking
we're saving the world?

36:37.480 --> 36:40.650
It's what the Callings
have been doing all along --

36:40.650 --> 36:42.490
manipulating us,
teaching us to trust

36:42.490 --> 36:44.570
so we will eventually
blindly obey,

36:44.570 --> 36:46.490
not caring whether
we're doing good or evil.

36:46.490 --> 36:50.410
Evil?
We're helping people!

36:50.410 --> 36:51.490
"Signs and wonders."

36:51.490 --> 36:53.040
Why do you keep
saying that?

36:53.040 --> 36:55.040
Matthew 24:24.

36:55.040 --> 36:56.370
My dad used to quote it.

36:56.370 --> 36:57.830
"False prophets will arise
from the dead

36:57.830 --> 36:59.460
to perform
signs and wonders."

36:59.460 --> 37:01.090
We're not false prophets.

37:01.090 --> 37:03.340
You keep assuming
we're on the side of good, Ben,

37:03.340 --> 37:06.340
but I know now
we are returned from the dead

37:06.340 --> 37:10.800
to be agents
of the apocalypse.

37:10.800 --> 37:13.930
You're deluded.

37:13.930 --> 37:16.190
"I see,"
said the blind man.

37:32.660 --> 37:35.370
Man:
Yeah, it's in here somewhere.

37:35.370 --> 37:37.000
What's going on?

37:37.000 --> 37:40.460
Just trying to find my ID.

37:40.460 --> 37:42.500
That's what
we're worried about.

38:26.210 --> 38:28.090
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

38:28.090 --> 38:30.340
She's fine.

38:30.340 --> 38:32.930
She's perfect.

38:32.930 --> 38:38.020

I can't do ♪

38:38.020 --> 38:43.110

39:45.250 --> 39:46.290
Hey.
Hey.

39:46.290 --> 39:47.670
I brought you takeout.

39:47.670 --> 39:50.670
Uh, thanks, but you know
I can cook, right?

39:50.670 --> 39:52.130
Yeah, I've had
your cooking.

39:52.130 --> 39:53.380
That's why
I brought you takeout.

39:53.380 --> 39:54.720
Tough crowd.

39:54.720 --> 39:58.390
I also brought you this,

39:58.390 --> 40:01.770
which you can share
with me.

40:01.770 --> 40:04.100
It's been
a minute, right?

40:04.100 --> 40:06.230
Yeah.

40:06.230 --> 40:07.860
I'm okay, though.

40:12.190 --> 40:14.860
Here's to Eden, the newest
member of the Stone family.

40:14.860 --> 40:17.620
She is small,
but she is mighty.

40:17.620 --> 40:19.240
Mm.

40:22.080 --> 40:23.750
What is it?

40:26.540 --> 40:29.630
I had to make a decision
in the hospital.

40:31.880 --> 40:34.220
Grace or the baby.

40:38.140 --> 40:42.390
Ben, no one should ever have
to make that decision.

40:42.390 --> 40:46.730
Well, I did. And I knew that
Grace wanted to protect the baby

40:46.730 --> 40:51.780
at all costs,
and I chose the opposite.

40:55.070 --> 40:58.200
I don't know how I would
have lived with that.

40:58.200 --> 40:59.740
You don't have to.

40:59.740 --> 41:01.080
They are both fine.

41:01.080 --> 41:03.160
You can go on
being the best father

41:03.160 --> 41:05.960
that I have ever,
ever seen.

41:05.960 --> 41:07.540
The Calling,
it came through.

41:07.540 --> 41:10.840
It saved them both.

41:10.840 --> 41:12.670
I wish Adrian
saw it that way.

41:12.670 --> 41:14.090
What do you mean?

41:14.090 --> 41:18.090
He's convinced the Callings
are manipulating us,

41:18.090 --> 41:20.350
all for some dark purpose.

41:20.350 --> 41:23.020
He thinks we're agents
of the apocalypse.

41:23.020 --> 41:24.980
What?
You believe him?

41:24.980 --> 41:26.600
Not after today.

41:28.940 --> 41:30.520
I'm with you.

41:32.520 --> 41:36.780
All good things.

41:41.870 --> 41:42.990
Kiddos are in bed?

41:42.990 --> 41:46.120
Yeah, safe and sound.
