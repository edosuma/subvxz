04:29.370 --> 04:31.940
- That's the last of the load?
- Yup.

04:38.980 --> 04:40.181
Alright. We're good!

04:44.452 --> 04:46.672
- Ho-ho.
- Hey, Joe, I'm on a break.

04:46.722 --> 04:49.374
- Break, huh?
- Yeah. You ever heard of one of those?

04:49.424 --> 04:51.209
No.

04:51.759 --> 04:55.345
Storm's coming. Take the load in
the morning. Stay in town tonight.

04:55.395 --> 04:59.751
No. I'll be all right. I gotta be back
by tomorrow and take care of some shit.

04:59.801 --> 05:01.286
Okay.

05:01.336 --> 05:03.689
- You got chains?
- Yeah, I got chains.

05:03.739 --> 05:05.724
If you get caught, you make sure
you chain up for S-curves.

05:05.774 --> 05:07.859
What is this, orientation? I got it.

05:07.909 --> 05:12.057
Besides, if it gets a little gnarly on
the pass, I'll just bunk at your cabin.

05:12.107 --> 05:15.967
You leave now, you'll make it.
You stay the fuck away from my cabin.

05:16.017 --> 05:19.087
- Drive safe, partner.
- Always do, man.

05:49.050 --> 05:50.351
Hey!

05:57.993 --> 06:00.211
Dad! How'd you know I was up here?

06:00.261 --> 06:02.147
'Cause the birds told me, that's why.

06:02.197 --> 06:06.251
They started chirping 'cause
I was too close to their nest.

06:06.301 --> 06:07.853
Mwah.

06:07.903 --> 06:10.221
They tell you that was coming, huh?

06:10.271 --> 06:12.290
- Full moon.
- No, no, no, no, don't!

06:13.340 --> 06:14.125
Stop!

06:14.175 --> 06:17.062
- Did you miss me, babe?
- Yeah. It's been like three whole days.

06:17.112 --> 06:18.229
It was five days, honey.

06:18.279 --> 06:19.497
Charlotte get her. Save Mom!

06:19.547 --> 06:20.766
Stop!

06:21.616 --> 06:24.469
Get off of me. No, don't you dare!

06:24.519 --> 06:27.072
You better give me kisses. Give me a kiss.

06:27.122 --> 06:30.208
Soup's on the stove.
Come here. Give me a kiss.

06:30.258 --> 06:31.442
Mwah.

06:31.492 --> 06:33.178
See you tonight.

06:33.745 --> 06:35.847
- Okay.
- I'll see you tonight.

06:35.897 --> 06:38.734
If you're even up by the time I get home,
I'll consider that foreplay.

06:38.814 --> 06:41.319
Uh-oh, what is that?
I don't know what she's talking about.

06:41.369 --> 06:42.888
Where's your grandpa?

06:42.938 --> 06:44.555
Oh, putting up Christmas lights. Back there.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.257
Oh, yeah, Christmas lights.

06:46.307 --> 06:49.360
That was a real adventure.
He's in the garage.

06:49.410 --> 06:50.996
Good luck with that.

06:51.046 --> 06:51.997
All right.

06:52.047 --> 06:54.099
You go make me some soup.

06:54.149 --> 06:56.501
Charlotte, you want a little brother?

06:56.551 --> 07:00.005
Mrs. Braven, see you tonight.

07:00.055 --> 07:01.840
Yeah.

07:03.324 --> 07:07.178
When I get home,
Joe Braven, when I get home...

07:07.228 --> 07:09.965
I love you.

07:14.035 --> 07:16.321
Hey, Pops.

07:16.371 --> 07:17.405
Hey.

07:19.340 --> 07:21.242
What are you doing?

07:23.011 --> 07:27.098
I came out here to find something.

07:27.148 --> 07:28.116
Christmas lights.

07:30.485 --> 07:31.586
Right here, Dad.

07:32.653 --> 07:35.473
Oh. I thought they'd...

07:35.523 --> 07:37.943
Well, they should be up here.

07:37.993 --> 07:39.845
Put things in their proper place.

07:39.895 --> 07:42.247
You always put things
where they're supposed to be.

07:42.297 --> 07:44.582
I'm working on it. Cheers.

07:47.635 --> 07:48.920
What is this?

07:48.970 --> 07:50.605
It's a porter.

07:52.007 --> 07:54.059
Tastes like a shit milk shake.

07:55.410 --> 07:57.045
Dinner's ready. Let's go.

08:11.026 --> 08:12.360
Daddy?

08:13.428 --> 08:15.380
Yeah.

08:15.430 --> 08:17.532
You were asleep again.

08:20.201 --> 08:22.053
- No.
- Uh-huh.

08:22.103 --> 08:23.321
- Uh-huh?
- Yeah.

08:23.371 --> 08:24.890
You calling me a liar?

08:24.940 --> 08:26.624
- Stop!
- Huh?

08:27.274 --> 08:30.295
- You always fall asleep.
- That's 'cause it's time for bed.

08:33.248 --> 08:34.664
There's Piggy.

08:34.715 --> 08:37.501
But you didn't even finish the story.

08:37.552 --> 08:40.288
- Really?
- Yes, really.

08:43.457 --> 08:45.210
All right, where were we?

08:45.260 --> 08:47.345
"The forest animals play hide and seek.

08:47.395 --> 08:49.981
Bethany Bear hides in her cave.

08:50.031 --> 08:52.450
She falls asleep,
and her friends can't find her.

08:52.500 --> 08:55.253
Winter turns to spring.

08:55.303 --> 08:58.489
And she's crowned the best hide
and seek champion in the whole forest."

08:58.539 --> 09:00.691
The end.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.260
Boop.

09:09.317 --> 09:11.102
Stop!

09:11.152 --> 09:13.004
Good night, pig.

09:13.054 --> 09:14.940
Don't do that again.

09:14.990 --> 09:17.275
- I love you.
- I love you too.

09:17.325 --> 09:19.077
Oh, I finished Grandpa's bracelet.

09:19.127 --> 09:21.112
Can I give it to him?

09:21.162 --> 09:25.083
He's probably asleep, honey,
just like you should be.

09:25.133 --> 09:27.635
We'll give it to him tomorrow.
Turn the light out.

09:36.511 --> 09:37.645
I love you.

09:48.156 --> 09:49.274
Pops?

10:49.250 --> 10:51.686
Oh, Jesus, not again.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.289
Hey, Pops.

11:02.463 --> 11:04.149
Hello?

11:04.199 --> 11:06.817
Joe, hey, it's Mike from the Trinity Bar.

11:06.867 --> 11:09.820
Yeah, listen, you better get over here.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.456
Yeah, your dad's here again.

11:11.506 --> 11:12.623
Excuse me?

11:12.673 --> 11:15.360
Time for us to go home.

11:15.410 --> 11:16.594
Let go.

11:16.644 --> 11:17.628
- Come on, baby.
- I don't...

11:17.678 --> 11:18.629
Hey!

11:18.679 --> 11:20.331
- Joe!
- I got it.

11:20.381 --> 11:21.332
I'm on my way.

11:21.382 --> 11:22.900
Linden, no!

11:23.651 --> 11:26.237
- Hey, what's going on?
- Dad's at the Trinity again.

11:26.287 --> 11:27.522
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

12:18.173 --> 12:19.607
You okay?

12:26.581 --> 12:28.299
No, no, I understand.

12:28.349 --> 12:31.702
Yeah, I understand. Okay, thanks, Harris.

12:31.752 --> 12:34.639
Guy he got into it with is on parole
for aggravated assault,

12:34.689 --> 12:38.209
so he doesn't want to press charges, but...

12:38.259 --> 12:40.745
we got a problem, Joe.

12:40.795 --> 12:45.450
It kills me to see your father this way,

12:45.500 --> 12:48.186
but this happens again,
I'm gonna have to arrest him.

12:48.236 --> 12:50.355
And you too.

12:50.405 --> 12:52.640
Yeah, I got it.

12:56.277 --> 12:59.364
We finished stitching him up
'cause it was a head injury.

12:59.414 --> 13:01.266
Daddy!

13:01.316 --> 13:02.500
Hello, pumpkin.

13:02.550 --> 13:04.902
Daddy, what happened to your face?

13:04.952 --> 13:07.772
I was wrestling with Grandpa.

13:07.822 --> 13:10.341
- How's he doing?
- We finished stitching him up.

13:10.391 --> 13:12.793
- Go check on Grandpa, okay?
- Okay.

13:15.530 --> 13:17.748
'Cause it was a head injury,
I ordered the MRI.

13:17.798 --> 13:20.685
- How's it look?
- It looked okay, but how'd he get in a fight?

13:20.735 --> 13:22.487
He thought a woman at the bar was his wife.

13:22.537 --> 13:24.389
It was my fault.
I was supposed to be watching him.

13:24.439 --> 13:27.325
Is he alone when you two are at work?

13:27.375 --> 13:30.828
I mean, I schedule my lessons
to work around Joe being gone,

13:30.878 --> 13:33.598
but sometimes things come up.

13:33.648 --> 13:36.934
Well, since your father's accident last year,
his mental condition is getting worse.

13:36.984 --> 13:38.869
Let me talk to another neurologist, okay?

13:38.919 --> 13:40.771
- He'll do a complete scan.
- No, we're done with that.

13:40.821 --> 13:43.341
Then I suggest you consider
a much more supervised approach.

13:43.391 --> 13:44.942
I'm not putting my dad in the home.

13:44.992 --> 13:46.977
Look, that's not the only option.

13:47.027 --> 13:49.680
Is he ready to go?

13:49.730 --> 13:52.750
Just think about it, Joe.

13:52.800 --> 13:53.834
Yeah.

14:05.613 --> 14:06.831
All right, baby girl.

14:06.881 --> 14:08.933
Let's get you home, get you to bed.

14:08.983 --> 14:10.451
Okay.

14:12.453 --> 14:15.290
Bye, Dad.

14:16.424 --> 14:18.459
- See you at home.
- Yeah.

14:20.895 --> 14:22.363
That's, uh...

14:26.301 --> 14:29.019
Donny's girl.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.638
Right?

14:32.873 --> 14:34.542
That's Charlotte, Dad.

14:35.776 --> 14:37.712
That's your granddaughter.

14:41.649 --> 14:43.334
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

14:43.384 --> 14:46.387
Yeah, Charlotte, yeah.

14:50.525 --> 14:53.761
Let's get you home, Pops, hmm?

16:02.397 --> 16:03.831
You ready motherfucker, hmm?

16:11.505 --> 16:14.675
Hey. Don't you puss out on me, man.

16:49.143 --> 16:51.429
So how often do you make
this run up north again?

16:51.479 --> 16:53.864
About every two weeks.

16:53.914 --> 16:56.667
Okay, any other drivers that make this run?

16:56.717 --> 16:58.936
We're not gonna involve anyone else, man.

16:58.986 --> 17:02.507
Why the fuck not?
That's how you branch out, move up.

17:02.557 --> 17:05.443
There ain't nobody else you can
trust to bring on this deal?

17:05.492 --> 17:06.743
It's not about trust, man.

17:06.794 --> 17:08.579
I'm just not involving anyone else.

17:08.628 --> 17:10.415
That's why you're always
gonna stay a fucking runner.

17:10.464 --> 17:12.750
That's fine, man.
I'm just gonna collect my money.

17:14.134 --> 17:15.185
Hold on!

17:15.234 --> 17:16.987
What the fuck?

17:18.806 --> 17:20.174
Jesus Christ.

17:22.977 --> 17:24.645
What the fuck, man?

17:26.847 --> 17:27.948
Damn it.

17:38.025 --> 17:39.827
What the fuck?

17:42.062 --> 17:43.180
Oh, Jesus Christ.

17:43.230 --> 17:44.849
What the fuck is wrong with you?

17:44.899 --> 17:47.618
All you had to do was drive
the fucking truck, man!

17:47.668 --> 17:50.588
We gotta get this shit out of here
before somebody comes, man.

17:50.638 --> 17:53.541
Fuck. Go get my bag and the ax.

18:05.585 --> 18:06.986
Fuck!

18:08.923 --> 18:10.775
- Where is it?
- Right here, right here.

18:10.825 --> 18:12.610
Give me the fucking flashlight.

18:12.660 --> 18:14.945
- Right here?
- Crack that fucker open.

18:14.995 --> 18:16.646
There you go.

18:22.069 --> 18:24.822
- That's my truck, man!
- Holy shit.

18:24.872 --> 18:26.056
That's my fucking truck!

18:26.106 --> 18:28.158
Relax. Open the fucking log.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.795
Dude, just get back here. Hurry up.

18:35.115 --> 18:37.001
Jesus, that's a lotta dope.

18:37.051 --> 18:38.669
I know. Kinda makes you hard, don't it?

18:39.319 --> 18:42.260
Come on. Load the fucking bag up.
Here, take it out of the bag.

18:42.340 --> 18:43.824
Oh, fuck.

18:45.826 --> 18:47.044
Fuck.

18:47.094 --> 18:49.764
Fuck. We need to extinguish this, man.

18:51.799 --> 18:53.884
We gotta get rid of the dope
before the cops come.

18:53.934 --> 18:55.553
Just get it in the bag.

18:55.603 --> 18:57.722
Dude, just figure out where we're gonna go.

18:57.772 --> 18:59.189
All right.

18:59.239 --> 19:01.626
We're not too far from my boss' cabin.

19:01.676 --> 19:04.261
It's a couple miles up the road.
We'll stash it there.

19:04.311 --> 19:06.246
All right, let's go.

19:53.027 --> 19:55.312
Honey, what are you doing?

19:55.362 --> 19:57.047
It's almost one in the morning.

19:57.097 --> 19:59.349
I'm almost done. Go back inside.

19:59.399 --> 20:00.868
Joe.

20:04.138 --> 20:05.856
Look at me.

20:05.906 --> 20:07.174
Hey.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.983
I don't wanna put my dad in a home.

20:30.965 --> 20:33.934
He's the strongest man I've ever known.

20:35.836 --> 20:37.705
Now look at him.

20:42.810 --> 20:45.612
I don't want Charlotte seeing him like that.

20:50.951 --> 20:52.653
I know.

20:54.188 --> 20:55.990
But we're a family.

20:59.093 --> 21:00.227
Okay?

21:02.029 --> 21:04.298
And we will make it through this.

21:06.200 --> 21:09.704
Maybe this doesn't have
to be our decision alone.

21:11.939 --> 21:14.241
You can talk to your dad.

21:16.443 --> 21:18.729
Take him to the cabin.

21:18.779 --> 21:21.799
Just you and him.

21:21.849 --> 21:24.118
You know he loves it there.

21:26.286 --> 21:29.223
Just get the conversation started.

21:33.260 --> 21:34.228
Hey.

22:06.894 --> 22:09.764
- All right, this is it.
- Thank God.

22:24.111 --> 22:25.896
You sure it's good here?

22:25.946 --> 22:27.982
Yeah. Joe's not coming up here, man.

22:31.085 --> 22:32.719
Oh, fuck.

22:39.026 --> 22:40.160
All right.

22:45.132 --> 22:46.934
Come on, man, hurry up.

22:49.369 --> 22:52.489
It's cold as shit up here.

22:52.539 --> 22:53.841
Here.

22:56.944 --> 22:59.429
All right, good, man.
We'll pick it up tomorrow.

22:59.479 --> 23:01.298
Fuck.

23:01.348 --> 23:02.900
Dude, I'm freezing.

23:02.950 --> 23:04.935
Just fucking take it if you're fucking cold.

23:04.985 --> 23:08.237
- Dude, I'm trying to share with you.
- Take the fucking blanket, man.

23:08.555 --> 23:09.974
Stay here.

23:10.024 --> 23:11.358
Thank God.

23:16.396 --> 23:18.816
Shit.

23:18.866 --> 23:21.886
It's okay. Relax. Don't worry about it.

23:26.340 --> 23:29.827
Thank you, sir! You stupid motherfucker.

23:29.877 --> 23:31.428
This is really funny to you, huh?

23:31.478 --> 23:33.363
That shit on the side
of the road, that's my life.

23:33.413 --> 23:35.165
You should be worried about Kassen.

23:35.215 --> 23:38.318
I gotta make the call,
so shut the fuck up about it.

23:56.236 --> 23:58.038
What's up, Kassen?

24:00.540 --> 24:02.426
Are you hungry?

24:02.476 --> 24:05.079
Pancakes here ain't half bad.

24:08.983 --> 24:10.247
Look,

24:11.140 --> 24:12.980
I know that I fucked up,

24:14.088 --> 24:16.624
but I'll make this thing right.

24:21.095 --> 24:23.297
Please give me the chance.

24:25.665 --> 24:27.201
Fuck.

24:46.386 --> 24:47.337
What?

24:47.387 --> 24:49.173
Slight hiccup.

24:49.223 --> 24:50.540
I don't have it with me.

24:50.590 --> 24:52.309
Oh, no.

24:52.359 --> 24:55.980
But I got the whole load.
Check this out, man.

24:56.030 --> 24:58.182
I know you wanted me to spread
this out over several runs,

24:58.232 --> 25:02.052
but I got this whole
motherfucking thing in one trip.

25:02.102 --> 25:04.054
Genius.

25:04.104 --> 25:06.056
Where is it?

25:06.106 --> 25:08.025
It's over the border, man. We got it stashed.

25:08.075 --> 25:09.927
It's all good.

25:09.977 --> 25:13.964
Slight hiccup is that we flipped
the truck, and the cops came.

25:14.014 --> 25:15.632
I got my boy Pete coming after it.

25:15.682 --> 25:18.668
Don't worry about it.
It's all good, all right?

25:18.718 --> 25:20.938
You tell Pete to stay home.

25:20.988 --> 25:23.407
- I'm coming.
- You can't smoke that in here.

25:23.457 --> 25:25.275
- I'll get him to put it out.
- Where the fuck are you?

25:25.325 --> 25:27.244
- It's okay.
- Some fucking shitty hotel.

25:27.294 --> 25:29.246
- Sir!
- It's okay, ma'am. I got it.

25:29.296 --> 25:31.315
Where we at, Weston?

25:31.365 --> 25:33.483
Greenwood Inn, room eight.

25:33.533 --> 25:36.070
We're at the Greenwood Inn, room eight.

25:40.007 --> 25:41.008
Fuck.

25:43.210 --> 25:45.345
Put it out, dickhead.

25:47.314 --> 25:48.248
Dickhead.

25:57.024 --> 25:58.525
This is gonna hurt.

26:35.560 --> 26:37.882
- Morning.
- Hey, Dad.

26:38.832 --> 26:41.285
- Morning, Grandpa.
- Hey!

26:41.335 --> 26:43.120
Look at you.

26:43.170 --> 26:45.222
- Hey, you make that for me?
- Yeah.

26:45.272 --> 26:46.723
Thank you.

26:46.773 --> 26:48.292
Hey, Pop, how you feeling today?

26:48.342 --> 26:50.727
I'm good. I feel good.

26:50.777 --> 26:54.364
Hey, I'm feeling like
I'm ready to go back to work.

26:54.414 --> 26:57.067
I think you need to take
the day off, Dad, okay?

26:57.117 --> 26:59.203
I was thinking maybe we'd go up to the cabin.

26:59.253 --> 27:00.287
Cabin? What for?

27:02.656 --> 27:05.142
Well, you can help me
shut it down for the winter.

27:06.292 --> 27:10.314
That's the first time your old man
ever asked for my help with anything.

27:10.364 --> 27:13.183
All right, I'll go.

27:13.233 --> 27:14.551
I wanna go. Please?

27:14.601 --> 27:15.752
Hey, I'll take you hunting.

27:15.802 --> 27:20.524
Maybe I can fix one of those bad habits
you're picking up from your dad.

27:20.574 --> 27:23.260
You know what? Actually,
I don't have to work today,

27:23.310 --> 27:25.329
so I need your help around here.

27:25.379 --> 27:27.197
Oh, Mommy, please?

27:27.247 --> 27:29.666
Don't give me that look. No, ma'am.

27:29.716 --> 27:31.335
Don't look at me.

27:31.385 --> 27:33.237
Dad, I never see you.

27:33.287 --> 27:36.040
Charlotte, listen to me. I owe you, okay,
baby? I promise I'll take you next time.

27:36.090 --> 27:38.142
You always say that.

27:38.192 --> 27:39.626
She's yours.

27:42.328 --> 27:45.049
Listen, I got everything packed up,
so you wanna grab your stuff?

27:45.099 --> 27:48.668
All right. You mind if I eat an egg first?

27:58.445 --> 28:00.130
I'll drive.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.832
I got it, Pops, I got it.

28:02.882 --> 28:04.084
All right.

28:12.159 --> 28:13.627
Get comfy, old man.

30:18.318 --> 30:19.586
Shit.

30:27.961 --> 30:29.696
Ah.

30:30.764 --> 30:32.832
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:36.002 --> 30:38.305
Goddamn! You get off on this shit, huh?

30:39.639 --> 30:41.491
Nice G.I. Joe gear, boy.

30:41.541 --> 30:43.227
Who's your friend?

30:43.277 --> 30:45.229
This is Weston, man. He's gonna lead the way.

30:45.279 --> 30:46.696
Okay.

30:46.746 --> 30:48.398
Why don't you ride with Gentry?

30:48.448 --> 30:50.684
You can ride with us, Weston.

30:51.985 --> 30:53.587
Gentlemen!

30:57.657 --> 31:00.260
Hey, hey, hey, hey, easy, man.

31:01.361 --> 31:03.330
Hey, what's up, man?

31:05.999 --> 31:07.567
How you doing?

31:17.877 --> 31:19.496
Good.

31:19.546 --> 31:21.831
We got power.

31:21.881 --> 31:24.951
We'll get those curtains open,
let some light in.

31:50.877 --> 31:53.029
Somebody left the crib half empty.

31:53.079 --> 31:54.764
Wanna bring in some timber?

31:54.814 --> 31:55.849
Yep.

32:10.930 --> 32:11.865
There you go.

32:14.368 --> 32:16.353
Can I talk to you for a second, Dad?

32:16.403 --> 32:18.855
Why don't you get the coffee going?

32:18.905 --> 32:22.592
Yeah, yeah, just a minute.

32:22.642 --> 32:24.578
Can I ask you something?

32:32.919 --> 32:36.556
You remember what happened
last night at the bar?

32:38.825 --> 32:41.545
I had a disagreement,
wound up with 11 stitches.

32:41.595 --> 32:44.381
Yeah, I remember.

32:44.431 --> 32:47.083
You grabbed a woman by the arm
and tried to pull her out.

32:47.133 --> 32:49.869
They said you thought she was Mom.

32:51.605 --> 32:54.073
Nah. I don't think so.

32:57.644 --> 33:00.129
Do you remember seeing
Charlotte at the hospital?

33:00.179 --> 33:04.501
Hey, what is this, huh? What are you doing?

33:04.551 --> 33:06.720
What are these questions?

33:08.588 --> 33:11.908
The doctor thinks you need
a different kind of supervision.

33:14.428 --> 33:16.446
I need to be supervised?

33:16.496 --> 33:18.615
No, but when you go off and do stuff that...

33:18.665 --> 33:22.051
What else does the doctor think?

33:22.101 --> 33:25.054
I need to be put somewhere,
maybe put in a home, huh?

33:25.104 --> 33:26.956
No, we're not doing that, okay?

33:27.006 --> 33:28.792
But we gotta talk about
something else that we can do.

33:28.842 --> 33:30.927
Oh, we do, huh? Let me tell you something.

33:30.977 --> 33:33.597
When my old man gave me the mill,

33:33.647 --> 33:36.466
he didn't have to because he could
still get it done, and so could I.

33:36.516 --> 33:37.901
I didn't put him out to pasture.

33:37.951 --> 33:40.970
I didn't put him in some goddamn home with a
bunch of drooling, bedwetting old bastards.

33:41.020 --> 33:42.506
I'm not gonna put you in a home.

33:42.556 --> 33:45.041
You're goddamn right you're not!

33:45.091 --> 33:46.693
Pops...

33:48.061 --> 33:49.162
Yeah.

33:50.997 --> 33:53.617
I forget some things now, all right?

33:53.667 --> 33:56.920
Hey, why don't you try falling 40 feet

33:56.970 --> 34:00.990
with nothing but a helicopter
dash to break your fall?

34:01.040 --> 34:03.893
See how you wind up, huh?

34:03.943 --> 34:06.029
Hot shot.

34:06.079 --> 34:09.197
Pops, I don't wanna fight. I just wanna talk.

34:09.248 --> 34:10.867
Yeah?

34:10.917 --> 34:13.652
Is it working out the way
you thought it would?

34:14.954 --> 34:16.822
Goddamn it.

34:58.698 --> 35:01.134
Shit. Stop right here.

35:11.077 --> 35:12.078
Ah, shit.

35:16.550 --> 35:18.051
Uh, I think, uh...

35:19.619 --> 35:21.571
I think Joe might be up here, man.

35:21.621 --> 35:24.741
Dude, what the fuck are you talking about?
You said the bag would be safe.

35:24.791 --> 35:26.059
All right.

35:28.595 --> 35:30.013
Any other roads out of here?

35:30.063 --> 35:32.782
No, this is the only one. There's ATV trails

35:32.832 --> 35:36.085
that go to the back ravines and Blue
Mountain, but this is the only road.

35:36.135 --> 35:38.154
The cabin's about a half-mile away.

35:38.204 --> 35:39.589
Cell service?

35:39.639 --> 35:41.891
Not up here.

35:41.941 --> 35:44.828
Except for maybe up on Blue Mountain.

35:44.878 --> 35:47.263
All right, we're gonna secure
the road 150 yards out.

35:47.313 --> 35:49.899
Clay, Louisi, take the east side of the road.

35:49.949 --> 35:53.102
Ridley, Essington,
you take the west of the road.

35:53.152 --> 35:54.604
We're gonna flank him. Gear up.

35:54.654 --> 35:57.173
Yo, G.I. Joe, let me get one of those.

35:57.223 --> 35:58.775
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

35:58.825 --> 36:01.578
Look, I know this guy. Let me talk to him.

36:01.628 --> 36:03.847
- What is this, man?
- Talk to him, motherfucker?

36:03.897 --> 36:06.182
We just need to go back in there
and get our shit.

36:06.232 --> 36:11.054
Anyone who hasn't royally fucked up
in the last 24 hours, raise your hand.

36:11.104 --> 36:13.657
Shut the fuck up and do as you're told.

36:13.707 --> 36:14.941
Hit it.

36:47.406 --> 36:48.775
What the...

37:08.127 --> 37:10.163
Latch is busted.

37:13.299 --> 37:15.702
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.

37:18.437 --> 37:19.656
Yeah.

37:19.706 --> 37:21.357
There's tracks out there.

37:21.407 --> 37:22.742
Footprints...

37:24.678 --> 37:26.312
...around here.

37:32.085 --> 37:33.236
Hi, Daddy.

37:33.286 --> 37:35.755
Charlotte, what are you doing here?

37:37.090 --> 37:39.408
Does your mother know where you are?

37:39.458 --> 37:41.210
I left her a note.

37:41.260 --> 37:42.912
Were you in the back of my truck?

37:42.962 --> 37:46.215
- Yeah.
- Baby, you're a rascal.

37:46.265 --> 37:47.366
Pops, let's go!

37:54.273 --> 37:55.825
Is everyone in position?

37:55.875 --> 37:57.393
Not yet.

37:57.443 --> 37:58.778
Almost.

38:05.719 --> 38:08.104
Dad, I'm sorry.

38:08.154 --> 38:09.756
Get in the car.

38:51.330 --> 38:53.783
Another male rides shotgun.

38:53.833 --> 38:55.301
Take 'em both out.

39:14.821 --> 39:16.305
What?

39:16.355 --> 39:17.791
Something's not right.

39:23.429 --> 39:25.031
Come on.

39:26.165 --> 39:27.934
Baby, get down, get down.

39:34.340 --> 39:35.809
No shot.

39:37.443 --> 39:39.796
Let's move to the perimeter of the cabin.

39:39.846 --> 39:41.865
Essington, take the back east corner.

39:41.915 --> 39:44.300
Louisi, front east.

39:44.350 --> 39:46.335
Ridley, you'll take the front west.

39:46.385 --> 39:48.137
And, Clay, take the rear west.

39:48.187 --> 39:50.339
Let me know when you're each in position.

39:50.389 --> 39:52.008
Let's go.

39:52.058 --> 39:54.127
You can ride in the big boy's seat.

39:55.261 --> 39:56.863
Fuck, man.

40:17.550 --> 40:20.003
- Close the curtains, Pops.
- What's going on?

40:20.053 --> 40:22.989
It's gonna be all right, baby.
It's gonna be all right.

40:27.526 --> 40:29.112
Daddy?

40:29.162 --> 40:31.230
It's gonna be okay, baby, okay?

40:40.439 --> 40:43.126
- The CB is in the shed.
- You good to shoot?

40:43.176 --> 40:44.878
What do you think?

40:47.346 --> 40:49.398
- Dad?
- It's gonna be okay, baby.

40:49.448 --> 40:51.400
Grandpa and I gotta do
a few things, all right?

40:51.450 --> 40:53.819
- I can help.
- Help by staying out of sight.

40:58.491 --> 41:01.510
It is very important that you do not
open this door unless it's for me, okay?

41:01.560 --> 41:03.246
- Okay.
- All right, baby.

41:03.296 --> 41:05.148
Get in there.

41:05.198 --> 41:06.532
Okay, I love you.

41:35.261 --> 41:36.262
Ehh.

41:37.997 --> 41:40.516
Once you're in position, check in.

41:40.566 --> 41:42.151
Copy. Rear east.

41:42.201 --> 41:44.153
I got rear west.

41:44.203 --> 41:45.221
Copy. Front west.

41:45.271 --> 41:47.090
Roger. Rear east.

41:47.140 --> 41:49.542
Hold your positions until the bag is secure.

42:26.312 --> 42:29.297
This is Joe Braven up on Blue Mountain.
Does anyone copy?

42:30.716 --> 42:33.569
This is Joe Braven on Blue Mountain.
Do you copy?

42:33.619 --> 42:35.972
This is Fish and Game. Go ahead, Joe.

42:36.022 --> 42:37.857
This is Joe Braven.

43:02.148 --> 43:03.666
Come on, man. Why we standing around?

43:03.716 --> 43:06.952
Give me a gun.
I'll go in there and get it myself.

43:09.455 --> 43:12.008
Do you know this guy?

43:12.058 --> 43:13.426
Yeah, man.

43:14.693 --> 43:16.629
Tell me about him.

43:20.366 --> 43:21.750
How many of them?

43:21.800 --> 43:24.237
I make four, at least.

43:25.338 --> 43:27.573
But you need to see this.

43:35.214 --> 43:37.383
- Motherfucker.
- Yeah.

43:40.286 --> 43:41.604
What are you gonna do?

43:41.654 --> 43:44.107
- I'm gonna go talk to him.
- No, no.

43:44.157 --> 43:46.109
With that amount of drugs,
they're not here to talk.

43:46.159 --> 43:49.628
They're gonna size you up,
take you out, then come for us.

43:52.498 --> 43:53.599
I got an idea.

43:55.834 --> 43:57.470
Son of a bitch.

44:11.117 --> 44:14.053
Hey, you know what you're doing?

44:15.188 --> 44:16.755
I think so, Pops.

44:18.424 --> 44:20.659
Why don't you go bring him out?

44:23.396 --> 44:24.713
Look, his family's in there.

44:24.763 --> 44:26.549
Let's just come back for the shit, man.

44:26.599 --> 44:29.085
Motherfucker's got our drugs.

44:29.135 --> 44:31.604
Just bring him out.

44:47.653 --> 44:48.804
He's coming out.

44:48.854 --> 44:50.623
Louisi, Ridley, come in from behind.

44:54.727 --> 44:56.595
Well, look at you.

45:00.366 --> 45:02.301
I'm so sorry, man.

45:07.440 --> 45:09.592
Ah, Mr. Braven.

45:09.642 --> 45:11.610
Sorry to interrupt your day.

45:15.180 --> 45:16.682
Yeah.

45:23.356 --> 45:25.658
Where the fuck's the rest of it?

45:29.862 --> 45:33.516
If you shoot me, my guys
will burn the other half.

45:33.566 --> 45:35.534
Okay.

45:37.703 --> 45:39.588
You clear off my property.

45:39.638 --> 45:42.491
I'll meet you in town
at the Waverlin Cafe in an hour.

45:42.541 --> 45:44.193
I'll bring the rest of it,
and you'll never see me again.

45:44.243 --> 45:45.528
Oh, no, no, no, fuck that.

45:45.578 --> 45:49.532
You get your Sasquatch ass back in there
and bring all of it out now, motherfucker.

45:49.582 --> 45:53.336
No, Joe, I don't wanna go into town.

45:53.386 --> 45:55.471
A city boy like me wouldn't be welcome there.

45:55.521 --> 46:01.360
And besides, what if I run
into Stephanie or Charlotte?

46:04.330 --> 46:07.283
I didn't come here to kill good people.

46:07.333 --> 46:08.717
I just want what belongs to me.

46:08.767 --> 46:10.703
Joe, just do what they want and then...

46:14.407 --> 46:17.193
So how 'bout you go inside,
get the rest of it,

46:17.243 --> 46:19.428
and then we'll be on our way.

46:19.478 --> 46:21.164
Could you do that for me, Joe?

46:21.214 --> 46:23.332
Please?

46:23.382 --> 46:25.251
Uh, yeah.

46:26.452 --> 46:27.753
Watch him.

46:56.949 --> 47:00.569
You know if you give the other half,
we're as good as dead.

47:00.619 --> 47:02.938
I got a sniper in the front woods.

47:02.988 --> 47:04.923
I'd like to take him out.

47:05.991 --> 47:07.743
Not yet, Pops.

47:07.793 --> 47:11.314
We gotta get Charlotte out of here,
then I'll come back for you.

47:11.364 --> 47:13.766
Until then, just wait.

47:15.868 --> 47:17.870
Roger that.

47:56.875 --> 47:58.861
Hi, baby. I got you.

47:58.911 --> 48:00.913
You're doing so good. Come on.

48:02.815 --> 48:05.268
It's gonna be okay, all right?

48:05.318 --> 48:07.770
Soon Grandpa and I are gonna
need your help, all right?

48:07.820 --> 48:10.439
- I'm ready.
- That's my tough little girl.

48:10.489 --> 48:12.425
You stay right here. I'll be right back.

48:15.328 --> 48:16.945
You still got 'em?

48:16.995 --> 48:18.581
Yeah, I do.

48:18.631 --> 48:20.833
Wait for my signal.

48:36.915 --> 48:40.035
Once we have the other half
secured, take 'em all out.

48:40.085 --> 48:41.837
Copy that.

48:41.887 --> 48:43.288
Copy.

48:58.837 --> 49:00.673
Yeah, yeah.

49:42.981 --> 49:44.649
He's got the bag!

49:46.518 --> 49:47.752
Fuck!

49:49.054 --> 49:50.906
Goddamn it. You with me.

49:50.956 --> 49:53.542
Lay down some cover. Second floor.

49:53.592 --> 49:55.210
Goddamn!

49:57.863 --> 49:59.615
Nobody gets out of that cabin.

50:00.065 --> 50:02.735
- Go!
- Oh, hell no! Hey!

50:04.703 --> 50:07.606
Hey! Hey, I need a fucking gun!

50:14.246 --> 50:15.580
Fuck.

50:59.625 --> 51:00.943
Charlotte, you remember the plan?

51:00.993 --> 51:02.711
- Okay.
- Yeah?

51:02.761 --> 51:04.112
You get to the top, you call Mama.

51:04.162 --> 51:06.048
- Yeah.
- I love you.

51:06.098 --> 51:07.583
Go.

51:07.633 --> 51:09.001
Run, run.

51:13.038 --> 51:14.873
Go!

52:10.996 --> 52:12.581
Stop.

52:12.631 --> 52:14.099
Kill the engine.

52:41.760 --> 52:43.912
Wait.

52:43.962 --> 52:47.984
The main road's that direction.
Why is he looping back around?

52:49.034 --> 52:50.853
- Ah...
- What's going on?

52:50.903 --> 52:54.740
He's not trying to run.
He's going back to the cabin.

52:57.175 --> 52:59.294
I'm going uphill,
try to find a sniper position.

52:59.344 --> 53:01.546
You push him back towards me.

53:08.320 --> 53:09.554
Charlotte!

53:12.157 --> 53:14.192
Charlotte, come on, baby.

54:49.021 --> 54:49.988
Oh, shit!

54:52.457 --> 54:54.176
All right.

54:54.226 --> 54:57.863
He's down on your side of the gorge.
Secure the bag, clean him up.

55:51.549 --> 55:52.901
I got the bag.

55:52.951 --> 55:55.037
And where's Braven?

55:55.087 --> 55:56.855
I'll find him.

56:15.573 --> 56:16.809
Kassen, Joe didn't...

56:18.143 --> 56:19.394
Gentry, say again.

56:19.444 --> 56:21.346
Say again, Gentry.

57:38.423 --> 57:40.107
Please pick up.

57:40.825 --> 57:41.844
- Joe.
- Mom?

57:41.894 --> 57:43.378
Charlotte?

57:43.428 --> 57:44.579
Charlotte, you can't run off like that.

57:44.629 --> 57:46.849
Stop. Mom, there are men shooting at us.

57:46.899 --> 57:49.017
- What did you say?
- They're shooting.

57:49.067 --> 57:51.319
I'll meet you at the lookout boulder
on Blue Mountain.

57:51.369 --> 57:53.555
Where are you? Hello?

57:53.605 --> 57:55.223
Charlotte, baby, I'm losing you.

57:55.273 --> 57:57.059
Hello, hello?

58:00.645 --> 58:02.730
If you'd like to make a call...

58:05.217 --> 58:06.501
If you'd like to make a call...

58:06.551 --> 58:07.953
Shit.

58:17.162 --> 58:18.513
Sheriff Ossler.

58:18.563 --> 58:21.316
Hey, Cal? This is Stephanie Braven.

58:21.366 --> 58:23.285
Listen, Joe's up at Blue Mountain.

58:23.335 --> 58:25.553
There seems to be some sort of trouble.

58:25.603 --> 58:27.389
- Trouble?
- Yeah.

58:27.439 --> 58:29.424
Charlotte called and said
there were men shooting.

58:29.474 --> 58:31.493
I don't know. Anyway, she lost reception.

58:31.543 --> 58:33.361
I tried calling her back,
and I can't get through.

58:33.411 --> 58:35.263
All right, we'll check it out.

58:35.313 --> 58:37.132
- I'm headed up there right now.
- No, you're not.

58:37.182 --> 58:38.233
We'll handle it.

58:38.283 --> 58:39.918
Just hurry, please.

58:42.220 --> 58:44.439
Dispatch, this is Ossler.

58:44.489 --> 58:47.375
Deputy Harris and I are headed over
to Blue Mountain to respond to a call.

58:47.425 --> 58:48.476
Will advise when we arrive.

58:48.526 --> 58:50.345
What's going on?

58:50.395 --> 58:52.514
Shots fired over
at the Braven cabin. Let's go.

58:52.564 --> 58:54.316
Man, look, it's probably just some kids

58:54.366 --> 58:58.136
who are shooting cans off
some fence posts or something.

59:23.761 --> 59:25.363
Fuck you, man.

59:36.741 --> 59:38.043
That's fucked.

59:53.425 --> 59:54.626
Shit.

59:56.728 --> 59:58.680
I think Joe's daughter was in that cabin.

59:58.730 --> 01:00:01.616
Ridley, get to the top of the mountain.

01:00:01.666 --> 01:00:04.969
Kid's trying to call for help.

01:00:48.713 --> 01:00:51.666
- Essington.
- Copy.

01:00:51.716 --> 01:00:53.235
Move to the west side of the cabin.

01:00:53.285 --> 01:00:54.602
Take a cover position.

01:00:54.652 --> 01:00:57.139
Clay, take your position near the back.

01:00:57.189 --> 01:01:01.559
I get my hands on this bag,
we kill all these sons of bitches.

01:02:10.195 --> 01:02:12.247
Clay, bag was another decoy.

01:02:12.297 --> 01:02:13.848
He's headed towards you.

01:02:13.898 --> 01:02:15.883
You go east along the trail. I'm coming.

01:02:15.933 --> 01:02:17.702
We'll flank him.

01:02:27.412 --> 01:02:28.580
Over.

01:02:34.419 --> 01:02:35.903
I'm trying to find it.

01:02:35.953 --> 01:02:37.772
Clay, find the ATV trail.

01:02:37.822 --> 01:02:39.757
He's coming back on that.

01:02:41.693 --> 01:02:44.179
The drugs are still in the cabin.

01:02:44.229 --> 01:02:46.581
Essington, Hallett, hold the perimeter.

01:02:46.631 --> 01:02:48.483
Do not engage.

01:02:48.533 --> 01:02:51.586
Do not give him any excuse
to burn those drugs.

01:04:16.554 --> 01:04:17.489
Goddamn it!

01:04:29.967 --> 01:04:32.554
You fucking missed me!

01:04:32.604 --> 01:04:33.788
Fuck!

01:04:33.838 --> 01:04:36.824
I should just fucking shoot him.

01:04:36.874 --> 01:04:39.694
You dumb fucking Indian.

01:04:39.744 --> 01:04:40.928
Whew!

01:04:40.978 --> 01:04:42.347
Fuck.

01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:47.379
Clay.

01:05:49.481 --> 01:05:51.883
- Clay, you see him yet?
- Not yet.

01:07:12.029 --> 01:07:14.882
- Come on.
- He's right there!

01:07:14.932 --> 01:07:15.900
Come on!

01:07:34.986 --> 01:07:37.605
Essington, Joe's coming.

01:07:37.655 --> 01:07:40.608
Move to the east side
of the cabin, near the trail.

01:07:40.658 --> 01:07:42.877
See if you can't get
a clean shot on that sniper.

01:07:42.927 --> 01:07:44.161
Take him out.

01:07:59.577 --> 01:08:01.746
Goddamn bastard.

01:08:40.752 --> 01:08:41.685
Fuck.

01:08:42.787 --> 01:08:44.020
No!

01:08:53.197 --> 01:08:55.166
Ah, fuck!

01:08:56.934 --> 01:08:57.969
Pin him in!

01:09:01.872 --> 01:09:03.741
Dad! Dad!

01:09:15.219 --> 01:09:17.287
Dad! Dad!

01:09:24.194 --> 01:09:26.631
Dad, Dad, it's Joe.

01:09:28.099 --> 01:09:31.118
Dad, it's Joe. It's Joe.

01:09:32.081 --> 01:09:33.921
Joe, Joe.

01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:34.939
Dad, it's me.

01:09:36.073 --> 01:09:37.925
Dad, you're Linden Braven.

01:09:37.975 --> 01:09:39.926
You're Linden Braven.

01:09:39.977 --> 01:09:41.863
You're Linden Braven.

01:09:41.912 --> 01:09:43.765
I'm your son. I'm your son.

01:09:43.814 --> 01:09:46.568
You're Linden Braven.
I'm your son. I'm your son.

01:09:46.618 --> 01:09:48.135
Shh, Dad.

01:09:48.185 --> 01:09:49.754
Come on!

01:09:57.995 --> 01:10:00.347
We're getting out of here. Come on.

01:10:00.397 --> 01:10:01.633
Come on, Dad.

01:10:05.770 --> 01:10:07.271
Come on, Pops.

01:10:08.906 --> 01:10:10.174
All right.

01:10:13.945 --> 01:10:16.030
That's it, Pops. Come on, come on.

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:18.049
I got you. Here.

01:10:22.353 --> 01:10:23.655
All right.

01:10:26.323 --> 01:10:27.709
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

01:10:27.759 --> 01:10:29.594
Sit down, sit down.

01:10:32.063 --> 01:10:34.081
Pops, look at me. Look at me.

01:10:34.131 --> 01:10:36.350
- I need you to wait here, okay?
- Okay.

01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:38.335
- Stay here.
- I'll come with you.

01:10:45.943 --> 01:10:49.196
All right, Pops, I'll be right back.

01:10:49.246 --> 01:10:50.815
- Joe.
- Stay here.

01:11:51.108 --> 01:11:52.343
No!

01:11:58.783 --> 01:12:00.217
Charlotte!

01:12:17.234 --> 01:12:19.020
Charlotte, run!

01:12:19.070 --> 01:12:21.272
Go to the road!

01:12:44.395 --> 01:12:46.280
You take the side and the front entrances.

01:12:46.330 --> 01:12:48.249
I'll go around the back.

01:12:48.299 --> 01:12:50.401
We're taking this goddamn cabin now.

01:12:51.535 --> 01:12:52.937
Fuck.

01:14:42.079 --> 01:14:43.898
Hey, hey!

01:14:43.948 --> 01:14:46.633
- Cal, stop. It's Charlotte.
- My mom and dad need help!

01:14:46.683 --> 01:14:48.936
There are men chasing my mom and dad.

01:14:48.986 --> 01:14:50.404
- They're all over the cabin.
- Dispatch, this is 101.

01:14:50.454 --> 01:14:53.925
Please send available units to the Braven
cabin, Blue Mountain Pass. Come on, Glen.

01:16:23.314 --> 01:16:25.032
Braven!

01:16:25.082 --> 01:16:27.368
Braven!

01:16:27.418 --> 01:16:29.103
Oh, shit.

01:16:29.153 --> 01:16:31.588
Oh, oh, shit.

01:16:48.205 --> 01:16:49.556
- Dad?
- Braven!

01:16:49.606 --> 01:16:51.425
Dad?

01:16:51.475 --> 01:16:52.443
Dad!

01:16:55.378 --> 01:16:58.299
- There he is.
- Let him go. Let him go!

01:16:58.349 --> 01:17:00.567
- Drop the ax!
- Let him go.

01:17:00.617 --> 01:17:02.703
You drop that fucking ax!

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:07.441
Just let him go. I'll go back inside,
get the bag, and you can go.

01:17:07.491 --> 01:17:08.775
- Okay?
- You'll get my bag?

01:17:08.825 --> 01:17:10.611
- Yeah.
- You gonna get my bag now?

01:17:10.661 --> 01:17:12.246
I'm sorry.

01:17:12.296 --> 01:17:14.781
That's what I wanted in the first place!

01:17:14.831 --> 01:17:17.418
Bring me another bag
of teddy bears? Fuck you!

01:17:17.468 --> 01:17:19.453
Just let him go.
He doesn't know what's going on.

01:17:19.503 --> 01:17:23.124
He's sick. Please.
Please just let him go. Just let him go.

01:17:23.174 --> 01:17:24.791
- You did this.
- Son, please.

01:17:24.841 --> 01:17:26.577
You did this to him!

01:17:27.644 --> 01:17:29.630
- No!
- Yeah!

01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:30.731
- Old fuck!
- No!

01:17:30.781 --> 01:17:32.199
Yeah!

01:17:32.249 --> 01:17:33.767
Hey.

01:17:38.155 --> 01:17:39.756
No, no, please no.

01:17:43.594 --> 01:17:44.561
Fuck.

01:17:47.531 --> 01:17:48.782
Son.

01:17:48.832 --> 01:17:50.801
Dad.

01:18:00.877 --> 01:18:02.429
No.

01:18:02.479 --> 01:18:04.631
No, no.

01:18:04.681 --> 01:18:07.351
Dad.

01:18:08.885 --> 01:18:10.187
Pops.

01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:14.541
No.

01:18:14.591 --> 01:18:15.726
Oh, God.

Oh, baby, are you okay?

Go around this trail. Get 'em.

01:20:17.514 --> 01:20:20.467

Charlotte's in the car. Go wait there.

01:21:31.388 --> 01:21:33.674
- Mommy! Mommy!

What the fuck's your problem?

01:25:10.674 --> 01:25:13.093

01:26:03.794 --> 01:26:05.812

01:26:08.832 --> 01:26:10.233

Bear trap?

01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:19.793
I'm gonna gut you, Joe.

01:26:19.843 --> 01:26:24.197
I'm gonna gut your wife,
and I'm gonna gut your little girl,

01:26:24.247 --> 01:26:26.850
just like gutted your old man.

01:27:05.055 --> 01:27:06.757
Joe!

01:27:20.203 --> 01:27:21.187
