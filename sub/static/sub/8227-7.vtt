00:37.864 --> 00:38.864
This is a car.

00:03.314 --> 00:05.648
And this is a car on MythBusters.

00:05.673 --> 00:07.998
Do not try what you're
about to see at home.

00:08.023 --> 00:10.334
We're what you call "experts".

00:11.530 --> 00:14.505
On this episode of "MythBusters"...

00:16.263 --> 00:19.945
Adam and Jamie have
a heavy-hitting movie myth...

00:19.946 --> 00:22.014
And it's a man.
"Ar-rah-rah-rah-rah."

00:22.015 --> 00:24.717
...Stuck between
two chubby cops...

00:24.718 --> 00:26.452
Come on! We got to get this guy
to the car right away!

00:26.453 --> 00:28.087
He's got an accident to attend!

00:28.088 --> 00:29.289
...Could a sandwiched suspect...

00:29.290 --> 00:30.657
Let's do this.

00:30.658 --> 00:33.593
...Survive the
mother of all truckin' t-bones.

00:33.594 --> 00:34.761
Aah!

00:35.763 --> 00:36.796
Boom!

00:36.797 --> 00:37.863
Better than a cup of coffee, isn't it?

00:37.864 --> 00:38.864
Wow.

00:38.865 --> 00:39.865
Meanwhile,

00:39.866 --> 00:41.033
Kari, Tory, and Grant

00:41.034 --> 00:43.903
have the most exhaustive
fuel-efficiency fable

00:43.904 --> 00:45.971
in "MythBusters" history.

00:45.972 --> 00:50.443
Follow us for fuel savings!
Learn about hypermiling!

00:50.444 --> 00:53.179
Could a troop of traffic tactics...

00:53.180 --> 00:54.414
Engine off.

00:54.415 --> 00:55.815
Shut off the engine.
Let's save some more fuel.

00:55.816 --> 00:59.151
...Really combine
to double your miles per gallon?

00:59.152 --> 01:01.421
I'm starting to get it,
hypermilers... I'm getting it.

01:01.422 --> 01:04.791
Or is this a myth that puts
the "rage" in road rage?

01:05.992 --> 01:07.226
She just gave me the bird.

01:07.227 --> 01:10.129
Yeah, you hate us. You hate science?

01:13.400 --> 01:14.867
Who are the MythBusters?

01:14.868 --> 01:16.436
Adam Savage...

01:16.437 --> 01:17.203
Oh!

01:17.204 --> 01:18.137
That's science.

01:18.138 --> 01:19.439
...And Jamie Hyneman.

01:19.440 --> 01:20.540
I'm ready.

01:20.541 --> 01:22.608
Between them,

01:22.609 --> 01:26.278
more than 30 years'
of special-effects experience.

01:26.279 --> 01:28.448
Together with Grant Imahara...

01:28.449 --> 01:29.782
Oh, it's burrowing!

01:29.783 --> 01:31.283
...Kari Byron...

01:31.284 --> 01:32.652
It always makes me feel dangerous.

01:32.653 --> 01:34.320
...And Tory Belleci...

01:34.321 --> 01:35.961
There's something
you don't see every day.

01:36.289 --> 01:38.791
...They don't just
tell the myths.

01:38.792 --> 01:41.327
They put them to the test.

01:41.328 --> 01:46.328

01:52.706 --> 01:54.741
All right, Jamie. I'm gonna
paint you a picture,

01:54.742 --> 01:56.376
and I want you to guess
the myth... are you game?

01:56.377 --> 01:57.710
- I'm ready.
- Here it goes.

01:57.711 --> 01:58.911
It comes from a foreign action movie

01:58.912 --> 01:59.912
called "Headhunters."

01:59.913 --> 02:00.873
You can't shrink a head.

02:02.048 --> 02:03.148
No.

02:03.149 --> 02:05.017
In this movie, our hero is seated

02:05.018 --> 02:06.986
in the back seat of a police car...

02:06.987 --> 02:08.821
You can't drive from the back seat.

02:08.822 --> 02:09.856
No.

02:09.857 --> 02:11.524
Let me just get through the story.

02:11.525 --> 02:13.860
He is seated
between two really big cops.

02:13.861 --> 02:16.462
And the bad guy wants to
kill him so badly,

02:16.463 --> 02:21.567
he takes a truck and he t-bones
the cop car at full speed.

02:21.568 --> 02:24.937
Except that our hero survives the crash.

02:24.938 --> 02:27.072
Because he's protected by the padding

02:27.073 --> 02:28.708
provided by the two big guys?

02:28.709 --> 02:29.909
Exactly.

02:29.910 --> 02:32.478
In a car accident,
could you be protected

02:32.479 --> 02:34.547
by the people you are sitting between?

02:34.548 --> 02:36.048
It's a movie myth

02:36.049 --> 02:38.551
that puts the "wide" in wide-screen.

02:38.552 --> 02:40.686
Could a set of heavyset policemen

02:40.687 --> 02:43.689
really protect you...

02:43.690 --> 02:46.459
...from a terrifying truck t-bone?

02:46.460 --> 02:50.062
Or has this myth got a fat chance?

02:50.063 --> 02:51.330
So, what's the plan?

02:51.331 --> 02:54.166
Well, this whole myth
is predicated on the idea

02:54.167 --> 02:56.502
that you're better off
being between two big dudes

02:56.503 --> 02:57.770
than you are being alone.

02:57.771 --> 02:59.038
I think that means we should see

02:59.039 --> 03:00.406
if we can illuminate
some of those forces

03:00.407 --> 03:01.541
with a scale test.

03:01.542 --> 03:03.876
See if we can collect
some relative data?

03:03.877 --> 03:05.077
Exactly.

03:05.078 --> 03:07.580
This is the exact make and model

03:07.581 --> 03:09.649
of the car that gets t-boned

03:09.650 --> 03:11.584
in the movie clip
that we're replicating.

03:11.585 --> 03:13.953
I'm about to mock it up in 1/6 scale

03:13.954 --> 03:15.855
so that we can actually see

03:15.856 --> 03:17.156
what's going to happen inside that car

03:17.157 --> 03:18.825
when we hit it with the truck.

03:18.826 --> 03:21.260
Adam's polycarbonate compact car...

03:22.830 --> 03:25.064
...is the first of four things
the guys need

03:25.065 --> 03:26.933
for their small-scale test.

03:26.934 --> 03:30.636
All right. There it is.

03:30.637 --> 03:32.538
Second is a truck stand-in,

03:32.539 --> 03:34.507
and for that, Adam's got wood.

03:34.508 --> 03:35.842
Great.

03:35.843 --> 03:38.811
He's building
a swinging battering ram...

03:38.812 --> 03:40.245
Akunamuta!

03:40.246 --> 03:42.682
...That should log
the perfect t-bone bench mark.

03:45.919 --> 03:50.222
The third ingredient is easy...
one crash-test dummy.

03:50.223 --> 03:51.791
That's awesome.

03:52.893 --> 03:56.095
Which just leaves
the padded policemen.

03:56.096 --> 03:58.631
So, my little dude's ready
to go into the rig,

03:58.632 --> 04:01.667
but I need a couple of big dudes
to place on either side of him.

04:01.668 --> 04:03.168
What are they gonna be made of?

04:03.169 --> 04:05.270
Well, humans are basically
bags of water,

04:05.271 --> 04:07.473
and that's what my big dudes
are going to be.

04:07.474 --> 04:09.141
I'm not gonna use
straight water balloons, though,

04:09.142 --> 04:10.309
'cause I don't want them to break

04:10.310 --> 04:11.978
and I'd like them
to be kind of barrel-shaped.

04:11.979 --> 04:14.446
So I'm going to sew out of some
really nice leather...

04:16.149 --> 04:18.183
Ahh! I love the smell of leather.

04:18.184 --> 04:22.522
...a pair of leather cylinders
to house my water balloons in.

04:22.523 --> 04:24.924
That should give us
a really good picture

04:24.925 --> 04:26.592
of what it's like to bounce around

04:26.593 --> 04:28.127
between a couple of big dudes.

04:28.128 --> 04:29.361
Ooh. Aah.

04:30.564 --> 04:32.698
Dude number two.

04:32.699 --> 04:36.936
With all the players primed,
it's time to swing for science.

04:36.937 --> 04:39.405
We're gonna smash
our miniature car twice...

04:39.406 --> 04:41.373
once with a dummy in it by himself

04:41.374 --> 04:44.443
and once with him padded
by these two water balloons.

04:44.444 --> 04:46.078
Now, we've got a sensor in here

04:46.079 --> 04:49.381
which will record the difference
between those two impacts.

04:49.382 --> 04:53.485
And for impact number
one, baby Buster's flying solo.

04:53.486 --> 04:57.122
Scaled car crash in 3, 2, 1.

05:02.429 --> 05:03.729
That was quick.

05:05.131 --> 05:08.167
In real time,
the tiny t-bone looked okay.

05:08.168 --> 05:11.737
But slowed down, it was anything but

05:11.738 --> 05:15.074
as Buster got thrown
left, right, and center,

05:15.075 --> 05:17.543
peaking at 150 G's.

05:17.544 --> 05:19.411
Now it's on to the padded version.

05:19.412 --> 05:21.047
For impact two,

05:21.048 --> 05:23.983
will the two cop cushions
lessen Buster's blow?

05:23.984 --> 05:25.618
All right.

05:25.619 --> 05:27.753
"Oh, no! This truck's out of control!"

05:29.289 --> 05:30.289
"No! Here it comes!"

05:30.290 --> 05:33.292
3, 2, 1... blam!

05:35.062 --> 05:39.298
First impressions are that
the crash seemed less intense.

05:39.299 --> 05:40.299
Ohh!

05:40.300 --> 05:42.735
That looks a lot better.

05:42.736 --> 05:46.438
Wow. It's like a forced bro hug.

05:47.440 --> 05:49.642
But what does the data say?

05:49.643 --> 05:52.678
Our dummy experienced
30 G's from the impact

05:52.679 --> 05:54.080
between the two big guys.

05:54.081 --> 05:57.216
He experienced over five times that...

05:57.217 --> 06:00.720
over 150 G's...
without that extra padding.

06:00.721 --> 06:04.023
So if this actually holds up
in the full scale,

06:04.024 --> 06:06.859
it could work
because 30 G's is survivable.

06:06.860 --> 06:09.795
150 G's is not.

06:11.331 --> 06:15.768
Next, a myth
about going the extra mile.

06:17.638 --> 06:19.538
All right. So, you guys have
your driving shoes on?

06:19.539 --> 06:21.406
Because this myth is the mother

06:21.407 --> 06:23.342
of all fuel-efficiency techniques.

06:23.343 --> 06:24.777
It's called hypermiling.

06:24.778 --> 06:26.746
Oh, is that where you drive
a certain way

06:26.747 --> 06:28.681
and it gets you really good gas mileage?

06:28.682 --> 06:30.582
Oh, not just really good gas mileage...

06:30.583 --> 06:31.617
<i>great</i> gas mileage.

06:31.618 --> 06:32.818
According to this myth,

06:32.819 --> 06:34.553
there's just a few simple things
that you can do

06:34.554 --> 06:36.522
to <i>double</i> your mileage.

06:36.523 --> 06:38.257
Regardless of the type of car you have,

06:38.258 --> 06:40.392
you can significantly reduce
your fuel consumption.

06:40.393 --> 06:42.728
Wait. So, are these techniques legal?

06:42.729 --> 06:44.096
Well, not all of them.

06:44.097 --> 06:46.198
I mean, there is one where
you can roll through stop signs.

06:46.199 --> 06:47.733
But the ones
that we're gonna be focusing on

06:47.734 --> 06:50.469
are completely 100% legal.

06:50.470 --> 06:52.304
And they double your gas mileage?

06:52.305 --> 06:53.706
That's what they say.

06:54.908 --> 06:57.242
It's a question
as old as the car.

06:57.243 --> 06:59.478
Is there anything you can do

06:59.479 --> 07:02.314
to make your gas-guzzler
guzzle less gas?

07:03.483 --> 07:06.085
Can some simple hypermiling techniques

07:06.086 --> 07:07.586
really double your mileage,

07:07.587 --> 07:10.422
or is this fuel fable running on empty?

07:13.160 --> 07:14.994
All right. So, you mentioned
a massive road trip,

07:14.995 --> 07:17.063
but that sounds a little more
like a finale, right?

07:17.064 --> 07:18.463
Yeah, exactly.

07:18.464 --> 07:20.465
Hypermiling is about taking
a bunch of small techniques,

07:20.466 --> 07:23.335
combining them, and getting
an overall fuel efficiency.

07:23.336 --> 07:24.804
So, what I think we need to do

07:24.805 --> 07:26.538
is break down each of these techniques

07:26.539 --> 07:28.507
and find out how fuel efficient
each of them are.

07:28.508 --> 07:30.209
Okay. So, what are they?

07:30.210 --> 07:31.310
Actually, out of the top six,

07:31.311 --> 07:32.678
we've already done three on our show.

07:32.679 --> 07:34.213
For example, we know, at high speeds,

07:34.214 --> 07:35.815
it's better to drive
with your windows up

07:35.816 --> 07:37.149
and your A-C on.

07:37.150 --> 07:38.317
This test is being done

07:38.318 --> 07:39.685
by professional drivers
on a closed track.

07:39.686 --> 07:40.786
Your results may differ.

07:40.787 --> 07:43.422
We know that
your fuel efficiency increases

07:43.423 --> 07:44.690
when you drive relaxed.

07:46.326 --> 07:48.694
<i>And</i> we know that over-inflating
your tires by 10%

07:48.695 --> 07:50.362
can really boost your mileage.

07:50.363 --> 07:52.198
We're getting
less rolling resistance

07:52.199 --> 07:54.066
and therefore, better fuel efficiency.

07:54.067 --> 07:56.268
Yeah, but there are three
that we have not tested,

07:56.269 --> 07:58.170
and that is limiting
your speed on a freeway,

07:58.171 --> 08:00.239
overall control of your acceleration,

08:00.240 --> 08:02.307
and turning off your engine
at a red light.

08:02.308 --> 08:03.809
All right. Well, why don't
we start with the speed test?

08:03.810 --> 08:05.077
I mean, that's easy.

08:05.078 --> 08:06.478
We could drive around a track
at three different speeds,

08:06.479 --> 08:07.479
compare the fuel usage.

08:07.480 --> 08:08.480
Sound good?

08:08.481 --> 08:10.082
Sounds cool.

08:10.083 --> 08:11.217
Let's hit the road.

08:11.218 --> 08:13.685
So, that's
six hypermiling secrets,

08:13.686 --> 08:16.521
and the MythBusters have
already ticked off three.

08:16.522 --> 08:19.058
However, before they put
them all together,

08:19.059 --> 08:23.062
they need to test the rest,
starting with limiting speed.

08:23.063 --> 08:25.798
But rather than hitting the highway...

08:25.799 --> 08:28.100
We're gonna save so much fuel.

08:28.101 --> 08:29.568
In your face, global warming.

08:30.170 --> 08:32.171
...first they're hitting the runway.

08:32.172 --> 08:34.940
We're here at the Alameda runway
to test hypermiling.

08:34.941 --> 08:37.909
Now, a car is most
fuel efficient at higher speeds

08:37.910 --> 08:39.378
because it's using higher gears

08:39.379 --> 08:42.047
and it's using momentum of the vehicle.

08:42.048 --> 08:44.316
But at a certain point,
those gears max out.

08:44.317 --> 08:47.086
You actually use more fuel
to get more speed.

08:47.087 --> 08:49.354
Not only that... the faster that you go,

08:49.355 --> 08:51.590
the more wind resistance
you're gonna experience,

08:51.591 --> 08:53.492
therefore making it less fuel efficient.

08:53.493 --> 08:54.960
So, there's a theory that driving slower

08:54.961 --> 08:56.262
might actually save you fuel.

08:56.263 --> 08:57.863
And to test that theory,

08:57.864 --> 08:59.999
they've set up a circuit one mile long.

09:00.000 --> 09:05.938

09:05.939 --> 09:11.410
They'll drive 20 laps
at 45, 55, and 65 miles per hour

09:11.411 --> 09:14.579
and get the fuel efficiency
of each speed.

09:14.580 --> 09:18.050
But how will they track
their gallons per mile?

09:18.051 --> 09:19.451
This piece of equipment right here

09:19.452 --> 09:21.153
is a very precise flow meter.

09:21.154 --> 09:23.388
It'll tell us how much fuel we consume.

09:23.389 --> 09:25.691
This is connected to the exhaust system.

09:25.692 --> 09:27.793
It's got a temperature sensor,
pressure sensor,

09:27.794 --> 09:28.894
and a flow meter.

09:28.895 --> 09:30.595
It's got a weather center here

09:30.596 --> 09:33.498
that helps us out with humidity,
atmospheric pressure,

09:33.499 --> 09:35.201
and ambient temperature,

09:35.202 --> 09:38.503
and a GPS to tell us precisely
how far we travel.

09:38.504 --> 09:40.840
So,
with the high-tech rig on board,

09:40.841 --> 09:44.210
now it's time to hightail it
for the test.

09:44.211 --> 09:45.911
Ready for a road trip?

09:45.912 --> 09:47.646
45-mile-per-hour test.

09:47.647 --> 09:49.748
3, 2, 1, begin.

09:49.749 --> 09:51.984
- Position running.
- Road trip!

09:51.985 --> 09:54.253
Don't worry.
You're not seeing triple.

09:56.789 --> 09:58.324
It's fun driving in circles, eh?

09:58.325 --> 09:59.524
It is.

09:59.525 --> 10:01.160
They do it in Nascar all the time.

10:01.161 --> 10:05.130
With over 20 minutes
at the same speed for each test,

10:05.131 --> 10:07.599
we're gonna need a split-screen montage.

10:07.600 --> 10:10.669
I prefer road trips where
we stop at cool destinations

10:10.670 --> 10:11.937
rather than take data.

10:11.938 --> 10:12.972
What do you mean?

10:12.973 --> 10:14.439
This is the road trip to science.

10:15.742 --> 10:17.843
I think we're in the lead.
I don't see any other cars.

10:18.945 --> 10:21.713
And while fuel-efficiency
data collection

10:21.714 --> 10:23.015
isn't the most stimulating...

10:23.016 --> 10:24.750
Sometimes you get to blow things up.

10:27.287 --> 10:30.589
Sometimes you drive in circles
with the air-conditioning off.

10:30.590 --> 10:34.360
...the MythBusters find a way
to make it interesting.

10:34.361 --> 10:35.961
It's a consistent pattern here.

10:35.962 --> 10:37.496
Every time we go in this direction,

10:37.497 --> 10:38.697
it's 18 gallons per hour,

10:38.698 --> 10:40.399
and every time we go in that direction,

10:40.400 --> 10:41.833
it's about 22 gallons per hour.

10:41.834 --> 10:43.135
At higher speeds,

10:43.136 --> 10:46.105
the wind resistance is affecting
the gas consumption.

10:46.106 --> 10:51.343
But will the hypermile speed
of 45 miles per hour avoid that?

10:51.344 --> 10:54.013
All right, kids. We're almost home!

10:54.014 --> 10:55.580
Thank goodness.

10:55.581 --> 10:58.284
Finally, after over 30 laps,

10:58.285 --> 11:00.719
it's time to pull up
and pump out the data.

11:00.720 --> 11:03.155
And we're here.

11:03.156 --> 11:04.156
And test.

11:04.157 --> 11:05.791
Okay, let's take our numbers

11:05.792 --> 11:07.226
over to the data-acquisition team,

11:07.227 --> 11:08.928
let them export them,
and do our comparison.

11:08.929 --> 11:12.298
I think we're gonna see
some serious savings.

11:12.299 --> 11:15.267
Well, it's over to Kent Johnson
and his team

11:15.268 --> 11:18.237
for the final tally
on the fuel efficiency.

11:18.238 --> 11:19.671
So, it's looking pretty good.

11:19.672 --> 11:20.906
At 65 miles an hour,

11:20.907 --> 11:23.675
we're seeing about 34 miles per gallon.

11:23.676 --> 11:26.578
At 55 miles an hour, it improved to 17%.

11:26.579 --> 11:29.481
And at 45 miles an hour,
it improved about 30%.

11:29.482 --> 11:31.350
That's actually really good for a myth.

11:31.351 --> 11:32.851
Yeah, these hypermilers
might be on to something.

11:32.852 --> 11:35.720
They might,
because a 30% saving

11:35.721 --> 11:39.124
just by decreasing your speed
to 45 miles per hour

11:39.125 --> 11:40.659
is impressive.

11:40.660 --> 11:43.195
So far, it's looking really good
for this myth of hypermiling.

11:43.196 --> 11:45.431
It turns out, after looking at the data,

11:45.432 --> 11:47.333
that if you drive
at slower speeds on the freeway,

11:47.334 --> 11:48.767
you will in fact save fuel.

11:48.768 --> 11:51.036
But that is just one piece
in the puzzle,

11:51.037 --> 11:53.538
because, remember, we're trying
to put all these together

11:53.539 --> 11:56.075
in order to double our mileage.

11:56.076 --> 11:57.476
Later,

11:57.477 --> 11:59.778
can the MythBusters double
the bank from their tanks?

11:59.779 --> 12:01.080
This stinkin' traffic

12:01.081 --> 12:04.016
is stopping and ruining
my coasting abilities.

12:04.017 --> 12:05.250
Shh! Shh! Shh! Calming.

12:05.251 --> 12:09.254
And the big rig takes on a big gig.

12:09.255 --> 12:10.422
That's a big dude.

12:10.423 --> 12:12.057
But will Buster survive?

12:12.959 --> 12:14.893
He's smiling. He liked it.

12:21.206 --> 12:24.917
Can being sandwiched
between two corpulent cops

12:24.918 --> 12:28.353
really let you survive
a tremendous t-bone?

12:28.354 --> 12:30.222
Small-scale said, "maybe."

12:30.223 --> 12:31.523
Ohh.

12:31.524 --> 12:33.192
That looks a lot better.

12:34.627 --> 12:38.530
So now it's time to up the ante
at Alameda runway.

12:39.765 --> 12:42.067
Today, instead of
remote controlling the vehicles

12:42.068 --> 12:43.501
or pulling them with cables,

12:43.502 --> 12:47.439
Jamie and I will be driving
this baby right here.

12:47.440 --> 12:48.874
Oh, yeah. It's on.

12:50.343 --> 12:52.510
Yep, for full scale,

12:52.511 --> 12:55.447
the MythBusters will literally
be putting their lives

12:55.448 --> 12:57.549
on the line for science.

12:57.550 --> 12:58.884
That ought to do!

13:01.354 --> 13:05.790
That's one big rig,
and two truckers raring to go.

13:05.791 --> 13:08.927
So, now to put the car
before the horsepower.

13:08.928 --> 13:10.162
Allow me to introduce you

13:10.163 --> 13:12.430
to the car we will be smashing today.

13:12.431 --> 13:14.466
It's not only the same
make and model as the car

13:14.467 --> 13:16.268
in the clip
we're attempting to replicate.

13:16.269 --> 13:18.937
It also has
a special significance to me.

13:18.938 --> 13:20.339
Here, take a look at this picture.

13:20.340 --> 13:24.009
That's me at 25 years old, 20 years ago,

13:24.010 --> 13:26.144
and that is my first car.

13:26.145 --> 13:29.014
Yes! This is the same
make and model as my first car.

13:29.015 --> 13:31.316
Once the car's all lined up,

13:31.317 --> 13:34.586
the final ingredient
for test one is the passenger.

13:34.587 --> 13:36.955
This is our human analog.
It's called a syndaver.

13:38.557 --> 13:40.525
It has individual muscles,
bones, and organs

13:40.526 --> 13:41.860
just like a human.

13:41.861 --> 13:45.964
Now, it will be our
crash-test dummy for this test,

13:45.965 --> 13:48.033
and we're gonna X-ray it first

13:48.034 --> 13:49.501
to make sure all its parts are intact.

13:49.502 --> 13:51.236
Immediately after the accident,

13:51.237 --> 13:52.971
our dummy will be X-rayed again

13:52.972 --> 13:55.073
and examined
by a friend of "MythBusters,"

13:55.074 --> 13:56.775
orthopedic surgeon Noah Weiss.

13:56.776 --> 13:59.844
And we'll see just what kind
of injuries our dummy sustained.

14:02.448 --> 14:03.982
Yep. It's all good.

14:03.983 --> 14:06.385
Now, in the movie,
our hero was seated

14:06.386 --> 14:07.852
in the back seat of a car just like this

14:07.853 --> 14:09.788
between two large policemen,

14:09.789 --> 14:11.723
and we will do that crash.

14:11.724 --> 14:12.958
That'll have to do.

14:12.959 --> 14:15.493
But in order to find out how good or bad

14:15.494 --> 14:18.030
that might have been for him,
we need a control.

14:18.031 --> 14:19.831
And that's why, in this test,

14:19.832 --> 14:22.901
our guy will be seated all alone
in the back seat.

14:22.902 --> 14:26.171
Yes. You'll be fine.
No. You won't be fine.

14:26.172 --> 14:28.407
He's not gonna be fine at all.

14:28.408 --> 14:32.144
And to quantify
just how "not fine" he'll be,

14:32.145 --> 14:35.380
the team adds PCB accelerometers,

14:35.381 --> 14:37.882
meaning the sandwiched suspect
is all set.

14:37.883 --> 14:39.985
I'm glad I'm not you.

14:39.986 --> 14:42.955
Cautiously,
Jamie climbs into the cab

14:42.956 --> 14:47.025
and takes the truck
to the far end of the runway.

14:47.026 --> 14:49.328
Then it's "go" time.

14:50.729 --> 14:52.497
All right, Jamie. Are you ready?

14:52.498 --> 14:54.466
Good to go.

14:54.467 --> 14:56.068
Crash-test control

14:56.069 --> 15:00.072
in 3, 2, 1... go!

15:01.841 --> 15:05.444
Like an angry walrus,
the truck heaves into action...

15:08.047 --> 15:11.216
...accelerating to the
50 miles an hour of the movie.

15:19.359 --> 15:20.792
Here it comes!

15:29.068 --> 15:30.002
Wow!

15:37.110 --> 15:39.944
That was amazing.

15:39.945 --> 15:43.148
That was one hell of a thud.

15:43.149 --> 15:44.582
Talk about crash...

15:46.219 --> 15:48.053
...bang...

15:48.054 --> 15:50.588
...boom!

15:50.589 --> 15:53.558
Their green machine's
been totally totaled.

15:58.031 --> 15:59.364
Well, that'll wake you up.

15:59.365 --> 16:03.568
That impact was...
It was frightening, actually.

16:06.272 --> 16:08.740
Hitting up on the car at that speed,

16:08.741 --> 16:10.342
you don't realize how fast you're going

16:10.343 --> 16:11.876
until you kind of get close to it,

16:11.877 --> 16:14.812
and then you realize
that this is gonna be serious.

16:16.149 --> 16:17.582
And it was.

16:17.583 --> 16:20.919
It was like a wracking explosion.

16:20.920 --> 16:21.853
It was a bang.

16:27.360 --> 16:30.095
Jamie may have lived
to tell the t-bone tale,

16:30.096 --> 16:32.130
but the question is, has Buster?

16:34.733 --> 16:35.767
He looks a little more flexible

16:35.768 --> 16:37.302
than he was when he first went in.

16:38.538 --> 16:42.474
Well, firstly, Dr. Weiss
delivers his prognosis.

16:42.475 --> 16:45.544
Dr. Weiss, how is our patient
after that accident?

16:45.545 --> 16:49.948
Well, this patient has sustained
multiple devastating injuries.

16:49.949 --> 16:53.218
There are fractures
and dislocations of the neck,

16:53.219 --> 16:56.054
the thoracic spine,
the low back, and pelvis.

16:56.055 --> 16:58.723
This patient is very, very dead.

16:58.724 --> 17:00.625
Wow. I want to say thank you,

17:00.626 --> 17:02.494
but I also... that's just so horrifying.

17:02.495 --> 17:06.298
And for a second opinion,
Dr. Harding has the G-load.

17:06.299 --> 17:08.833
All right, David. How did our guy do?

17:08.834 --> 17:11.336
The chest saw 540 G's.

17:11.337 --> 17:12.604
Ow!

17:12.605 --> 17:14.771
And his head saw 620.

17:14.772 --> 17:16.540
That's... that's... that's dead.

17:16.541 --> 17:17.976
Deader than a doornail.

17:17.977 --> 17:19.478
Yep,

17:19.479 --> 17:23.115
because that's over six times
the survivable threshold.

17:23.116 --> 17:25.183
The difference
between this kind of crash

17:25.184 --> 17:27.085
and what happens
between a couple of cars

17:27.086 --> 17:28.520
when they hit on the highway

17:28.521 --> 17:30.322
is that the truck here is a brute.

17:31.657 --> 17:33.125
And the numbers bear that out.

17:33.126 --> 17:36.561
You've got enormous figures
on the G-loads.

17:36.562 --> 17:38.163
The big question here is,

17:38.164 --> 17:39.664
what happens when we put our dummy

17:39.665 --> 17:42.066
between a couple of fat guys?

17:42.067 --> 17:43.835
Will he survive then?

17:43.836 --> 17:45.237
Looking at this kind of damage,

17:45.238 --> 17:47.239
it'll be really something if he does.

18:02.779 --> 18:05.112
The MythBusters
are doubling down,

18:05.114 --> 18:08.988
testing if hypermiling methods
can double your mileage.

18:08.990 --> 18:12.492
Hypermiling's efficient,
just not <i>time</i> efficient.

18:12.493 --> 18:16.496
So far, limiting your speed
to 45 miles per hour

18:16.497 --> 18:18.431
scores you an extra 30%.

18:18.432 --> 18:20.300
Those hypermilers
might be on to something.

18:20.301 --> 18:22.670
But now to get off the freeway

18:22.671 --> 18:25.072
and start hypermiling in traffic.

18:25.311 --> 18:27.745
The plan for this
experiment is pretty simple.

18:27.746 --> 18:29.247
We've laid out a driving course.

18:29.248 --> 18:31.983
You sure that Grant's the right
person to be the test driver?

18:31.984 --> 18:33.718
There's 20 laps per circuit,

18:33.719 --> 18:35.520
and we have stop signs

18:35.521 --> 18:37.122
and randomly timed traffic lights.

18:37.123 --> 18:40.491
Now, for the first test, we're
going to just get a bench mark.

18:40.492 --> 18:42.060
It's our control. We drive normally.

18:42.061 --> 18:43.694
Like their previous test,

18:43.695 --> 18:47.032
high-tech wizardry
will track the fuel consumption.

18:47.033 --> 18:50.402
Okay, this is the control test
for hypermiling, lap 1.

18:50.403 --> 18:51.502
Let's do this.

18:55.908 --> 19:00.045
And to make sure there are no
other variables, the A-C is off.

19:00.046 --> 19:04.682
All our designated driver Grant
needs to do is drive normally...

19:06.152 --> 19:07.652
Hey, mom, dad, are we there yet?

19:07.653 --> 19:09.254
Not there yet, honey.

19:09.255 --> 19:12.424
...Accelerating and
braking as he usually would...

19:12.425 --> 19:14.725
- Oh, God. I hate this light.
- I know. It's so long.

19:14.726 --> 19:16.861
There's not a single
other car... what's the holdup?

19:16.862 --> 19:19.497
...And sticking
to the speed limit

19:19.498 --> 19:21.032
of 30 miles per hour.

19:21.033 --> 19:22.300
Science makes me carsick.

19:22.301 --> 19:23.868
Then, after 20 laps,

19:23.869 --> 19:25.670
they've got their control baseline.

19:25.671 --> 19:27.405
It was really interesting
to watch the equipment

19:27.406 --> 19:28.840
as Grant was driving.

19:28.841 --> 19:32.810
Even at idle, the car is using
about 0.5 gallons per hour.

19:32.811 --> 19:34.079
And then, when Grant was speeding up,

19:34.080 --> 19:37.515
he was getting up to
about 6.5 gallons per hour.

19:37.516 --> 19:40.085
Now it's time to see what
the techniques of hypermiling

19:40.086 --> 19:43.054
are gonna do and how it affects
how much fuel we use.

19:43.055 --> 19:44.356
Hopefully, we save some.

19:44.357 --> 19:47.692
Yep, and those
hypermiling traffic tactics

19:47.693 --> 19:51.396
all rest on how you
accelerate, stop, and brake.

19:51.397 --> 19:53.064
Now, for this, you see a light,

19:53.065 --> 19:55.100
you start to decelerate
in case it turns red.

19:55.101 --> 19:56.968
If you have to stop at a red light,

19:56.969 --> 19:58.736
you turn the car completely off.

19:58.737 --> 20:00.338
And then, when you start up again,

20:00.339 --> 20:02.340
you accelerate
really, really, really slowly

20:02.341 --> 20:03.608
to save as much gas as possible.

20:03.609 --> 20:06.611
Now, acceleration
is basically burning fuel,

20:06.612 --> 20:09.280
but braking is a complete waste
of the car's energy

20:09.281 --> 20:11.883
because you're basically
stopping all the momentum

20:11.884 --> 20:13.318
of the vehicle.

20:13.319 --> 20:16.121
Now, how's this gonna translate
into the fuel consumption?

20:16.122 --> 20:17.288
That's what we're about to find out.

20:17.289 --> 20:20.225
Okay, painfully slow acceleration.

20:20.226 --> 20:21.359
You're doing well.

20:21.360 --> 20:23.794
Uh-oh.
There's a stop sign coming up.

20:23.795 --> 20:26.131
Decelerating early.

20:26.132 --> 20:28.933
Make a full complete stop.

20:28.934 --> 20:32.303
Really smooth acceleration.

20:32.304 --> 20:34.872
This is like my driver's ed test.

20:36.542 --> 20:40.145
Interesting thing.
There's no peaks right now.

20:40.146 --> 20:44.249
It's all just kind of
consistent, low fuel usage.

20:44.250 --> 20:46.251
Just like the control,

20:46.252 --> 20:48.686
Grant must stick to the
30-mile-per-hour speed limit.

20:48.687 --> 20:50.021
But this time,

20:50.022 --> 20:53.591
he's limiting both his
acceleration and deceleration.

20:53.592 --> 20:54.992
See, you slow a little bit

20:54.993 --> 20:56.561
in anticipation of a possible red

20:56.562 --> 20:57.628
and rolled through it.

20:57.629 --> 20:58.763
- Nice.
- Yeah.

20:58.764 --> 21:00.998
And when they don't catch
the green light...

21:00.999 --> 21:02.667
Oh, oh, oh, oh. Here comes the light.

21:02.668 --> 21:04.769
Slow. Slow. Slow.

21:04.770 --> 21:06.671
Shut off the engine.
Let's save some more fuel.

21:06.672 --> 21:09.541
Engine off.

21:09.542 --> 21:11.008
We should have done this
during the winter.

21:11.009 --> 21:12.477
- Green light.
- Oh, geez.

21:12.478 --> 21:13.578
Okay.

21:13.579 --> 21:15.980
Just like the control,

21:15.981 --> 21:18.216
they complete 20 sweaty circuits,

21:18.217 --> 21:23.221
and eventually, it's time
to find out how fuel frugal

21:23.222 --> 21:25.190
this technique really is.

21:25.191 --> 21:26.991
- All right.
- Whew. We made it.

21:26.992 --> 21:28.793
- Nice driving.
- Thank you.

21:28.794 --> 21:31.796
- Well done.
- Whew. Ohh.

21:31.797 --> 21:33.864
So, the results are in.
Let's take a look at the data.

21:33.865 --> 21:35.200
Now, I need a graph here.

21:35.201 --> 21:36.801
As you can see,
in Grant's control test...

21:36.802 --> 21:38.736
him driving normally,
which is a little scary...

21:38.737 --> 21:41.606
he was able to get 13 miles per gallon.

21:41.607 --> 21:43.774
But then, on his hypermiling test...

21:43.775 --> 21:45.310
his eco-friendly driving...

21:45.311 --> 21:47.345
he was able to get 17 miles per gallon.

21:47.346 --> 21:50.148
That is a 30% increase.
This is incredible.

21:50.149 --> 21:52.783
But, remember, this myth
is about doubling your mileage.

21:52.784 --> 21:54.819
So, we need to take
all these techniques,

21:54.820 --> 21:56.154
put them together,

21:56.155 --> 21:58.022
and see if we can get
that mythical double mileage.

21:58.023 --> 21:59.457
Aah!

21:59.458 --> 22:02.893
That's another two
ticks for the hypermile code.

22:02.894 --> 22:05.230
Which means it's time
to put it all together

22:05.231 --> 22:07.064
and go road tripping.

22:08.867 --> 22:10.235
I love you, too!

22:13.972 --> 22:17.509
There's no way
a solo middle-seat suspect

22:17.510 --> 22:19.210
will survive a t-boning truck.

22:19.211 --> 22:20.245
Whoo-ha!

22:22.348 --> 22:24.715
This patient is very, very dead.

22:24.716 --> 22:28.419
But will some big-boned busters help?

22:28.420 --> 22:31.256
We've now come to the point
in the episode where it's time

22:31.257 --> 22:35.293
for Jamie and I to make
a pair of plus-sized busters.

22:35.294 --> 22:38.095
Now, here's the problem we have.

22:38.096 --> 22:40.465
They got to weigh 350 pounds apiece,

22:40.466 --> 22:43.168
which means just making them
is going to be difficult

22:43.169 --> 22:44.702
both in terms of moving them around,

22:44.703 --> 22:46.571
installing them in the car,
et cetera, et cetera.

22:46.572 --> 22:49.140
There is so much
static electricity in this foam.

22:49.141 --> 22:50.708
Check out my hairdo. Whoo!

22:50.709 --> 22:53.278
So, we've come up with what
I think is the perfect solution,

22:53.279 --> 22:56.614
which is to carve our dudes
out of an open-cell foam.

22:56.615 --> 22:58.849
I'll state outright I've never
worked with a piece of foam...

22:58.850 --> 23:00.218
this freakin' big before.

23:00.219 --> 23:02.086
I didn't even know
you could get them this big.

23:02.087 --> 23:05.390
Then we will coat the outside
of our carved figure

23:05.391 --> 23:06.791
in a hard rubber

23:06.792 --> 23:07.892
and put it in the car.

23:07.893 --> 23:08.959
Is this how Michelangelo
starts the Pietà?

23:08.960 --> 23:10.161
I know what you're saying.

23:10.162 --> 23:11.596
"That doesn't weigh
as much as a person."

23:11.597 --> 23:13.964
No, it doesn't.
That'll make it easy to install.

23:13.965 --> 23:16.701
Once it's <i>in</i> the car,
we will fill it with water.

23:16.702 --> 23:20.004
It's a lightweight
solution to a heavyset problem...

23:20.005 --> 23:22.307
two giant blocks of foam

23:22.308 --> 23:25.610
and two MythBusters armed
with two very different ideas.

23:25.611 --> 23:28.646
Adam's going for
the suck-it-and-see approach,

23:28.647 --> 23:31.015
drawing an obese outline
and letting rip.

23:33.785 --> 23:37.088
Jamie, on the other hand, is
being a little more methodical.

23:37.089 --> 23:38.956
To sculpt my fat guy,

23:38.957 --> 23:40.925
I could just start hacking away
at a chunk of foam,

23:40.926 --> 23:42.360
which is what Adam is doing.

23:42.361 --> 23:46.531
I opted, instead, to do it
from a computer-generated image

23:46.532 --> 23:47.965
that I found online.

23:47.966 --> 23:51.269
This is a top view of our guy,

23:51.270 --> 23:55.273
and what we've done
is slice him in chunks

23:55.274 --> 23:58.409
that end up looking like this one.

23:58.410 --> 24:00.378
This is around
the midsection of his body.

24:00.379 --> 24:03.914
This top surface represents
the top surface

24:03.915 --> 24:05.916
of a 4-inch slab of foam.

24:05.917 --> 24:08.586
So, when I cut this out,
all I have to do

24:08.587 --> 24:11.956
is stack all these other pieces
together...

24:11.957 --> 24:13.625
One fat guy in 2-D.

24:13.626 --> 24:16.427
...and I've got my guy.

24:16.428 --> 24:17.795
It's classic "MythBusters."

24:17.796 --> 24:20.831
Adam forges ahead fast and furious...

24:20.832 --> 24:24.168
Come on, fat man! Show yourself!

24:24.169 --> 24:28.539
...While Jamie
is more slow and steady.

24:28.540 --> 24:31.175
One using intuition...

24:31.176 --> 24:32.977
I'm starting to
figure out what he looks like.

24:34.079 --> 24:36.748
...The other using ingenuity.

24:36.749 --> 24:38.949
This doesn't look
like much right now,

24:38.950 --> 24:41.252
but as soon as I start
stacking these blocks,

24:41.253 --> 24:42.887
it's gonna turn into something.

24:42.888 --> 24:44.789
But before long,

24:44.790 --> 24:46.557
both are taking shape...

24:46.558 --> 24:48.926
I'd say that's a pretty heavy guy.

24:48.927 --> 24:51.763
I'm so in love with this thing.

24:51.764 --> 24:54.499
...Even if one
has been a little neater.

24:54.500 --> 24:57.067
This is the sum total of my scrap.

25:00.406 --> 25:03.007
I'm just saying.

25:04.042 --> 25:07.211
Next, Jamie moves on
to adding a plumbing system...

25:07.212 --> 25:09.514
That's how we're gonna get the water in.

25:09.515 --> 25:13.284
...So that his foam
figure can become big-boned.

25:13.285 --> 25:15.486
There we go. He's plumbed,
and he's got a skeleton.

25:15.487 --> 25:18.956
Now all I have to do
is make him look real.

25:18.957 --> 25:21.225
Meanwhile,
Adam's got a problem.

25:21.226 --> 25:24.195
His chubby chum is just too big.

25:24.196 --> 25:26.864
He's a giant, and I don't
think he'll fit in the car,

25:26.865 --> 25:29.467
so I'm gonna take about 6 inches

25:29.468 --> 25:31.836
right out of his center chest here.

25:33.171 --> 25:35.640
Luckily,
a few nip and tucks later...

25:38.109 --> 25:39.377
Much better.

25:39.378 --> 25:41.746
...And Adam's dummy is ready

25:41.747 --> 25:43.247
for its own plumbing parts.

25:44.416 --> 25:47.452
- Nice.
- Yeah. Isn't that cool?

25:48.721 --> 25:50.555
That just leaves two things.

25:50.556 --> 25:51.889
And it's a man.

25:51.890 --> 25:53.057
"Ar-rah-rah-rah-rah."

25:53.058 --> 25:55.893
First,
a split-screen time lapse

25:55.894 --> 25:57.562
while the full-figured foam
is finessed...

25:57.563 --> 26:00.030
Man, they look fantastic.

26:00.031 --> 26:03.701
...And second,
a leak-free rubber skin...

26:03.702 --> 26:06.871
One coat down, he is almost done.

26:06.872 --> 26:10.742
...That'll let their
chunky creations hold water.

26:10.743 --> 26:11.976
Over the past 10 years,

26:11.977 --> 26:13.778
we've done hundreds of experiments

26:13.779 --> 26:16.881
with 44 different Busters
and Buster analogs.

26:22.220 --> 26:23.988
Right at this moment right now,

26:23.989 --> 26:28.025
Mr. Orange here is
my flat-out all-time favorite.

26:28.026 --> 26:32.096
And once Mr. White and
Agent Orange are all dried up...

26:34.332 --> 26:36.133
It's clobberin' time.

26:36.134 --> 26:37.435
Yeah!

26:37.436 --> 26:39.303
Keep on trucking...

26:39.304 --> 26:40.337
Let's do this.

26:40.338 --> 26:41.338
Here we go!

26:41.339 --> 26:42.339
...'Cause after the break,

26:42.340 --> 26:45.209
will the boys in blubber save Buster?

26:45.210 --> 26:46.711
My sphincter tightened!

26:51.379 --> 26:52.713
In hypermiling,

26:52.714 --> 26:55.516
Tory wants one more
pre-road-tripping test.

26:55.877 --> 26:57.044
Next, we're gonna see

26:57.045 --> 26:59.312
about taking off
the side-view mirror of a car.

26:59.313 --> 27:01.682
Apparently, it makes the car
so aerodynamic

27:01.683 --> 27:03.583
that it gives you better mileage.

27:05.219 --> 27:07.554
And for some
quick aerodynamics,

27:07.555 --> 27:10.157
it's off to the N.A.S.A. water channel.

27:10.158 --> 27:11.558
- You ready for the big show?
- Yeah.

27:11.559 --> 27:12.592
Here it goes.

27:12.593 --> 27:14.227
Nice.

27:14.228 --> 27:16.529
All right. So, that is
the side with the mirror,

27:16.530 --> 27:17.831
and you can see the drag

27:17.832 --> 27:19.232
where the dye is just hanging there.

27:19.233 --> 27:22.202
All right. I'm gonna move
to the side without the mirror.

27:22.203 --> 27:24.304
And it flows right away.

27:24.305 --> 27:26.239
It just goes right by. There's no drag.

27:26.240 --> 27:28.809
Yep. Removing a mirror to reduce drag

27:28.810 --> 27:31.712
should result
in more fantastic fuel savings.

27:35.181 --> 27:37.743
Do not try what
you are about to see at home.

27:37.773 --> 27:40.438
We're what you call "experts."

27:42.810 --> 27:45.698
Want to save money
and time at the gas pump?

27:45.700 --> 27:47.467
The MythBusters do.

27:47.468 --> 27:50.971
So they're joining the hypermile club...

27:50.972 --> 27:52.339
- Oh, oh, oh, oh.
- All right.

27:52.340 --> 27:54.608
Shut off the engine.
Let's save some more fuel.

27:54.609 --> 27:57.511
...To find out
if this fuel-saving system

27:57.512 --> 27:59.646
can double the bank from your tank.

27:59.647 --> 28:01.848
For our hypermiling grand finale,

28:01.849 --> 28:03.918
we'll be driving this 2012 sedan,

28:03.919 --> 28:06.120
the one that we've been using
for all of our shorter runs,

28:06.121 --> 28:08.355
but we're throwing another car
in the mix.

28:08.356 --> 28:11.625
This one's five years older, and
it has over 75,000 miles on it.

28:11.626 --> 28:13.527
Grant and I will
be in the brand-new car,

28:13.528 --> 28:15.162
and Tory will be driving this one.

28:15.163 --> 28:17.364
Don't worry. He won't be lonely.

28:17.365 --> 28:18.698
Buster's in the passenger seat.

28:18.699 --> 28:20.467
He's a great conversationalist.

28:20.468 --> 28:21.601
Now, for our test,

28:21.602 --> 28:23.070
we'll be using our same
fuel-measurement system.

28:23.071 --> 28:24.671
But we're also gonna be measuring

28:24.672 --> 28:25.906
the old-fashioned way,

28:25.907 --> 28:28.008
and that is by driving
till we run out of gas.

28:28.009 --> 28:31.678
Here we go... exactly three gallons.

28:33.148 --> 28:36.150
So, we're gonna be driving
one giant lap

28:36.151 --> 28:38.185
around the Bay area, about 150 miles.

28:38.186 --> 28:39.553
Now, that's a good distance,

28:39.554 --> 28:41.788
and it's gonna give us
a real-world average.

28:41.789 --> 28:43.523
We're gonna be driving
through city streets,

28:43.524 --> 28:45.492
country roads, and freeways.

28:45.493 --> 28:46.560
And to avoid traffic,

28:46.561 --> 28:48.228
we're gonna drive
in the middle of the day,

28:48.229 --> 28:50.030
so that way, we don't have
any extra variables

28:50.031 --> 28:51.031
messing up our data.

28:51.032 --> 28:52.699
Give me those.

28:52.700 --> 28:55.902
It's the fuel efficiency
road trip to rule them all.

28:55.903 --> 28:58.538
They're even adding an aerodynamic skin

28:58.539 --> 29:00.341
and removing a side mirror

29:00.342 --> 29:03.777
to combine every single fuel-saving tip

29:03.778 --> 29:05.612
for hyper-hypermiling.

29:05.613 --> 29:08.115
All right. Let's save some fuel.

29:08.116 --> 29:09.916
With three gallons
of gas on board,

29:09.917 --> 29:12.586
drivers, start your engines.

29:13.921 --> 29:16.656
Adiós, suckers. Let's hypermile.

29:16.657 --> 29:19.326
It's going to be intense,

29:19.327 --> 29:21.628
because they've got
a hypermiling checklist

29:21.629 --> 29:23.464
a hypermile long.

29:23.465 --> 29:26.266
Never drive
above 45 miles per hour.

29:26.267 --> 29:27.534
Done.

29:27.535 --> 29:29.903
Remove the wing mirror
on the passenger door.

29:29.904 --> 29:31.472
Done.

29:31.473 --> 29:33.207
Avoid braking and rapid acceleration.

29:33.208 --> 29:34.208
Done.

29:34.209 --> 29:35.642
Turn off engine at stoplights.

29:35.643 --> 29:37.844
I don't like this at all.

29:37.845 --> 29:39.913
Try and stay relaxed.

29:39.914 --> 29:41.081
Green light. Green light.

29:42.550 --> 29:43.884
Gentle.

29:43.885 --> 29:46.786
- Not turning on the A-C.
- Done.

29:46.787 --> 29:49.390
Legally drafting when
the opportunity presents itself.

29:49.391 --> 29:51.025
Okay. I haven't had
that opportunity yet.

29:51.026 --> 29:54.194
Overinflating our tires by 10%.

29:54.195 --> 29:55.229
They're at capacity.

29:55.230 --> 29:59.266
Cover the cars in streamline skin.

29:59.267 --> 30:00.700
Done.

30:00.701 --> 30:02.169
And lastly,
try to navigate intersections

30:02.170 --> 30:03.603
so we're always going
through green lights.

30:03.604 --> 30:04.905
I think we're doing well.

30:04.906 --> 30:06.373
But hold on.

30:06.374 --> 30:07.707
Aren't we forgetting something?

30:07.708 --> 30:09.876
What about a control?

30:09.877 --> 30:12.712
Well, luckily, they did that yesterday.

30:12.713 --> 30:16.116
It was a control cruise
of an identical route...

30:18.219 --> 30:19.619
I forgot... I don't speak Wookiee.

30:19.620 --> 30:20.921
I also speak Klingon.

30:20.922 --> 30:21.988
I bet you do.

30:21.989 --> 30:23.157
Qah'ta!

30:23.158 --> 30:25.025
...at an identical time of day...

30:25.026 --> 30:26.760
We can play this game.

30:26.761 --> 30:27.961
You want to play the silent treatment?

30:27.962 --> 30:29.430
I can play the silent treatment, too.

30:29.431 --> 30:32.066
...Under identical
weather conditions...

30:32.067 --> 30:35.702
Wow. This is a beautiful place
to conduct a science experiment.

30:35.703 --> 30:37.371
You getting allergies?

30:38.973 --> 30:41.608
...driven completely normally
with no hypermiling

30:41.609 --> 30:44.411
until their three gallons of gas
ran out.

30:45.046 --> 30:46.846
We're running out. We're running out.

30:46.847 --> 30:49.015
- Well, that's it.
- All right.

30:49.016 --> 30:52.686
I think that's it, Buster.
We are out.

30:52.687 --> 30:55.089
Whoo. All right.
That's it for the control test.

30:55.090 --> 30:59.493
We went 64 miles
and got 21.3 miles per gallon.

30:59.494 --> 31:01.695
So, Buster and I made it 78 miles

31:01.696 --> 31:03.029
on three gallons of gas.

31:03.030 --> 31:05.232
That is 26 miles per gallon.

31:05.233 --> 31:07.267
That was the control,

31:07.268 --> 31:09.736
and they'll need to double those figures

31:09.737 --> 31:11.037
to confirm this myth.

31:11.038 --> 31:14.208
So, it's back
to today's hypermiling test,

31:14.209 --> 31:16.042
and in the midst of city traffic...

31:16.043 --> 31:17.077
Oh, shoot.

31:18.413 --> 31:21.515
You really got to pay attention
when you're hypermiling.

31:21.516 --> 31:23.984
Otherwise, you're gonna
@#$% off a lot of drivers.

31:23.985 --> 31:26.587
...Fuel frugality
is frustrating.

31:26.588 --> 31:28.655
This is it. We are coast city.

31:28.656 --> 31:30.324
But it doesn't matter,

31:30.325 --> 31:31.925
because all this stinkin' traffic

31:31.926 --> 31:35.195
is stopping and ruining
my coasting abilities.

31:35.196 --> 31:38.365
Shh! Shh! Shh!
Calming. Calming. Calming.

31:38.366 --> 31:40.867
Maybe I should drive home.

31:40.868 --> 31:43.203
Engine off.

31:43.204 --> 31:46.607
However, soon, they're through
the stress of the city,

31:46.608 --> 31:50.010
and the motors are still running
as they head out on the highway.

31:50.011 --> 31:54.481
Oh! Is that us causing all that traffic?

31:55.983 --> 31:56.983
Oops.

31:58.486 --> 32:00.086
She just gave me the bird.

32:00.087 --> 32:03.190
Yeah, you hate us. You hate science?

32:03.191 --> 32:04.625
What? You don't like science?

32:05.793 --> 32:07.227
But while
their disciplined driving

32:07.228 --> 32:10.230
has other drivers road-raging,

32:10.231 --> 32:11.465
they are making savings.

32:11.466 --> 32:15.935
We are at... let's see,
our mileage is 31.315.

32:15.936 --> 32:21.241
Okay, so that is 12 miles past our mark.

32:21.242 --> 32:22.776
- Really?!
- Yeah.

32:22.777 --> 32:24.645
- Wow!
- So we got 52 to go.

32:24.646 --> 32:26.713
Okay. Whether it's confirmed or not,

32:26.714 --> 32:28.948
I'm sort of impressed already.

32:28.949 --> 32:30.651
At the 80-mile mark,

32:30.652 --> 32:32.452
they've reached the scenic route

32:32.453 --> 32:35.088
and topped their control mileage.

32:35.089 --> 32:37.457
This is the first time
that we're seeing

32:37.458 --> 32:39.393
really windy roads on this course.

32:39.394 --> 32:40.927
Now the technique here

32:40.928 --> 32:43.597
is to kind of maintain
a consistent speed

32:43.598 --> 32:46.567
so that you don't have to
actually brake in the turns.

32:46.568 --> 32:49.369
Because if you're braking,
you're losing energy.

32:49.370 --> 32:51.171
But now that there's some downhill,

32:51.172 --> 32:53.840
I'm gonna just try to coast
through these turns

32:53.841 --> 32:54.841
at a safe speed.

32:54.842 --> 32:56.843
Hang on, Buster.

32:56.844 --> 32:58.312
You know, hypermiling is a commitment.

32:58.313 --> 33:00.814
It's a way of life.

33:00.815 --> 33:02.449
It's scary!

33:02.450 --> 33:04.418
Or possibly a way of death, too.

33:06.554 --> 33:08.021
Aah!

33:08.022 --> 33:10.624
I'm starting to get it,
hypermilers... I'm getting it.

33:10.625 --> 33:14.261
I understand you people now.
I didn't think I understood you.

33:14.262 --> 33:15.662
Now I get it.

33:15.663 --> 33:17.664
Kari's got
the fuel-savings fever...

33:17.665 --> 33:20.234
You might see actual tears
if we don't make this.

33:20.235 --> 33:22.569
...and energy to burn.

33:22.570 --> 33:23.737
The only problem is,

33:23.738 --> 33:26.340
- the engine doesn't.
- Uh-oh.

33:26.341 --> 33:29.142
Because despite Kari's deft driving...

33:29.143 --> 33:30.677
That's it.

33:30.678 --> 33:32.546
...they're running on empty.

33:32.547 --> 33:33.980
That's it. No brakes.

33:33.981 --> 33:36.816
Well, we definitely did not
double our mileage.

33:36.817 --> 33:39.119
I was getting so optimistic.

33:39.120 --> 33:40.520
It was looking so good.

33:40.521 --> 33:43.123
Yeah, we didn't even come close
to doubling our mileage.

33:43.124 --> 33:45.525
We went 64 the first time
on our control,

33:45.526 --> 33:47.694
and we only got to 90 this time.

33:47.695 --> 33:49.363
That's only 40%.

33:49.364 --> 33:52.999
Yep. 40% is a long way from 100%.

33:53.000 --> 33:57.036
However, this myth <i>and</i> Tory
are still on the road.

33:57.037 --> 33:59.539
I just hit 136 on my odometer,

33:59.540 --> 34:02.743
which means 20 more miles,
and this myth is confirmed!

34:02.744 --> 34:04.210
This is insane!

34:04.211 --> 34:07.247
Am I the only one excited about this?!

34:07.248 --> 34:09.149
Yeah, I guess so.

34:09.150 --> 34:11.885
However, Tory
might have spoken too soon.

34:11.886 --> 34:13.853
Ooh. I'm running out of gas.

34:17.123 --> 34:19.426
I was so close!

34:19.427 --> 34:21.762
Aah!

34:21.763 --> 34:23.297
I was so close.

34:23.297 --> 34:27.833
I was just saying
how I was at 136 miles.

34:27.835 --> 34:29.469
All I needed was 20 more miles,

34:29.469 --> 34:31.505
and we were gonna confirm this myth.

34:31.505 --> 34:35.975
And as soon as I finished saying
that, the engine shut off.

34:35.976 --> 34:38.612
I think we have to bust this one.

34:38.612 --> 34:40.580
I mean, it did give us
a lot more mileage,

34:40.581 --> 34:43.350
but it's not <i>doubling our mileage.</i>

34:43.351 --> 34:45.385
So this one's looking busted.

34:45.386 --> 34:49.121
Tory managed
an impressive 70% increase,

34:49.123 --> 34:51.291
while Kari and Grant scored 40%.

34:51.292 --> 34:53.527
So, even though the myth's busted,

34:53.527 --> 34:56.429
it's still fuel for thought.

34:56.431 --> 34:59.032
I started out with pure skepticism,

34:59.033 --> 35:02.669
thinking that hypermiling
was just a whackadoo theory

35:02.670 --> 35:06.773
to starting to believe it,
to starting to get into it,

35:06.774 --> 35:09.209
to starting to work the system
and feel the gain,

35:09.210 --> 35:12.813
to getting really emotionally
excited about the fact

35:12.814 --> 35:14.448
that we hit a hill or a turn

35:14.449 --> 35:16.550
so I could save that little bit of fuel,

35:16.551 --> 35:19.118
just a few drops that were
gonna get us that extra mileage.

35:19.119 --> 35:21.722
And though we did not
double our mileage,

35:21.723 --> 35:24.157
40% is nothing to laugh at.

35:36.439 --> 35:37.439
Welcome back.

35:37.440 --> 35:38.506
We've been testing the story

35:38.507 --> 35:40.108
that if you're in the back seat of a car

35:40.109 --> 35:42.844
that gets t-boned
by a truck like this one,

35:42.845 --> 35:44.078
you're better off being sandwiched

35:44.079 --> 35:45.947
between two big dudes.

35:45.948 --> 35:47.749
So, to test this, we did a control

35:47.750 --> 35:49.618
in which we put our crash-test dummy

35:49.619 --> 35:51.686
in the back seat
with nothing around him,

35:51.687 --> 35:54.021
and we hit him with this very truck.

35:54.890 --> 35:57.091
Wow!

35:57.092 --> 35:58.660
Things didn't fare so well for him.

35:58.661 --> 35:59.794
He died.

35:59.795 --> 36:02.029
This patient
is very, very dead.

36:02.030 --> 36:04.466
Now we're gonna sit him
in the back seat of a new car

36:04.467 --> 36:06.134
between two big dudes,

36:06.135 --> 36:08.670
and we're gonna hit them
with this truck again.

36:08.671 --> 36:11.273
Yep.
With two portly passengers,

36:11.274 --> 36:14.442
this is going to be
one super-sized finale.

36:14.443 --> 36:16.344
- Are you ready?
- We're all ready.

36:16.345 --> 36:18.813
Excellent.

36:18.814 --> 36:22.817
Like the control, a brand-new
syndaver takes a back seat.

36:22.818 --> 36:24.586
Come on, buddy.

36:24.587 --> 36:26.488
We'll get him in here if it's
the last thing he ever does.

36:26.489 --> 36:28.456
Oh, wait. It is the last thing
he ever does.

36:28.457 --> 36:30.792
And once he's sitting pretty
in the middle...

36:30.793 --> 36:31.793
Excellent.

36:31.794 --> 36:34.996
...it's time to call the cops.

36:34.997 --> 36:37.932
Remember, right now
their chubby creations...

36:39.134 --> 36:40.769
Time for your accident, little buddy.

36:40.770 --> 36:42.203
...Are lightweights,

36:42.204 --> 36:46.341
tipping the scales
at a mere 12 pounds each.

36:46.342 --> 36:48.543
That's it! I got it!

36:48.544 --> 36:50.912
But all that's about to change.

36:50.913 --> 36:52.880
All right, buddy.
Let's get you up to weight.

36:54.016 --> 36:55.116
To get our cops

36:55.117 --> 36:56.718
to the required mass and consistency

36:56.719 --> 36:58.353
of an obese person,

36:58.354 --> 37:00.054
we're simply gonna fill them up
with water.

37:00.055 --> 37:02.357
Oh, it's working beautifully.

37:02.358 --> 37:03.658
One gallon... that's 8 pounds.

37:03.659 --> 37:04.959
We've got a bunch to go.

37:04.960 --> 37:07.261
Now, based on
their overall volume,

37:07.262 --> 37:09.831
each guy will weigh about
350 pounds when they're full...

37:09.832 --> 37:11.199
They're starting to get denser.

37:11.200 --> 37:13.134
...Which is right
in the ballpark we need.

37:13.135 --> 37:17.138
All right. Dude is full of water
and up to weight.

37:17.139 --> 37:19.541
Now it's up to Jamie.

37:19.542 --> 37:22.009
And once Mr. White's
also piled on the pounds...

37:22.010 --> 37:24.011
That's a big dude.

37:24.012 --> 37:27.515
...cop number two, like
the experiment, is good to go.

37:27.516 --> 37:29.250
I don't think there's any question here

37:29.251 --> 37:30.885
if the prisoner's gonna do better

37:30.886 --> 37:33.287
with these guys around him
than he would by himself.

37:33.288 --> 37:35.523
He will. Padding is good. It works.

37:35.524 --> 37:37.492
That's why they put airbags in cars.

37:37.493 --> 37:39.861
The only real question here

37:39.862 --> 37:41.963
is whether he will actually survive.

37:41.964 --> 37:43.898
Is the padding enough to do that?

37:43.899 --> 37:45.333
I really don't know.

37:45.334 --> 37:47.301
Time to suit up.

37:47.302 --> 37:49.203
Although this time
Adam's behind the wheel,

37:49.204 --> 37:52.640
for this full-figured finale,
everything else is the same...

37:52.641 --> 37:54.075
Let's do this.

37:54.076 --> 37:55.243
...The same car

37:55.244 --> 37:57.311
with the same truck
going the same speed.

37:57.312 --> 38:00.849
The only difference?
Those plus-sized passengers.

38:00.850 --> 38:02.250
Okay, Adam. Are you ready?

38:03.753 --> 38:05.453
Ready.

38:05.454 --> 38:08.723
All right. On my mark...

38:08.724 --> 38:12.360
3, 2, 1... go.

38:15.364 --> 38:17.164
Okay.

38:18.768 --> 38:22.036
37 miles per hour.

38:22.037 --> 38:23.037
45.

38:25.474 --> 38:26.340
48.

38:27.610 --> 38:28.810
You're at 50.

38:28.811 --> 38:30.144
Hold it at 50.

38:30.145 --> 38:32.013
Hold it right there.

38:32.014 --> 38:34.015
All right. Here we go!

38:35.083 --> 38:36.885
Aah!

38:44.727 --> 38:45.960
Wow!

38:45.961 --> 38:47.228
Oh, my gosh!

38:47.229 --> 38:49.631
That's just... awful.

38:49.632 --> 38:51.065
Whoo!

38:51.066 --> 38:53.334
And yet it's kind of cool.

38:53.335 --> 38:56.538
Whoa, boy!

38:56.539 --> 38:58.072
My sphincter tightened!

38:59.241 --> 39:00.241
Whew.

39:00.242 --> 39:01.443
Are you okay?

39:01.444 --> 39:03.478
Wow, what a concussion!

39:05.213 --> 39:06.414
Boom!

39:06.415 --> 39:09.551
I think I screamed for the last 30 feet.

39:09.552 --> 39:11.185
I just went, "aah!"

39:11.186 --> 39:12.286
Aah!

39:12.287 --> 39:14.456
Boom!

39:14.457 --> 39:15.590
Better than a cup of coffee, isn't it?

39:15.591 --> 39:16.524
Wow.

39:18.727 --> 39:20.762
That was a rush.

39:20.763 --> 39:22.964
It may have
been a rush for Adam,

39:22.965 --> 39:25.366
but it was savage for the car.

39:25.367 --> 39:28.402
We have teeth on the syndaver.

39:28.403 --> 39:30.171
That is awful.

39:30.172 --> 39:31.439
He's smiling.

39:31.440 --> 39:32.807
He liked it.

39:32.808 --> 39:35.242
And if this hit looks bad
from the outside...

39:35.243 --> 39:36.310
Eww.

39:36.311 --> 39:38.746
...Inside the car, it's a disaster.

39:38.747 --> 39:40.214
His head came off.

39:41.817 --> 39:44.018
Well, his head's come off.

39:44.019 --> 39:45.620
That's not a good sign.

39:45.621 --> 39:48.055
No, I mean, his head's,
like, come clean off.

39:50.092 --> 39:52.961
It's like, no' attached to his body.

39:52.962 --> 39:54.896
Well, that means we don't need no data.

39:55.965 --> 39:57.966
Still, we might as well.

39:57.967 --> 40:00.835
Remember, Jamie thought
Buster might survive

40:00.836 --> 40:02.871
courtesy of his portly pals.

40:02.872 --> 40:04.606
Oh, you don't look so good.

40:04.607 --> 40:09.043
Yet given his decapitation,
that's not looking likely.

40:09.044 --> 40:12.046
- Look.
- Yeah, I know.

40:12.047 --> 40:13.815
But what do the doctors say?

40:16.585 --> 40:18.653
So, doc, his head fell off,
but what else is wrong with him?

40:18.654 --> 40:21.589
In addition to his complete
dislocation of his head...

40:23.225 --> 40:25.493
...he sustained massive injuries

40:25.494 --> 40:29.764
to his chest, abdomen, pelvis,
all of his extremities.

40:29.765 --> 40:31.933
These are devastating.

40:31.934 --> 40:33.935
Our first dummy was certainly dead,

40:33.936 --> 40:35.670
but this one's even more dead.

40:35.671 --> 40:37.839
Well, that's not at all
what we expected,

40:37.840 --> 40:39.440
but that's pretty definitive.

40:39.441 --> 40:43.011
Maybe, but were the G-loads
on buffered Buster

40:43.012 --> 40:44.345
lower this time around?

40:44.346 --> 40:46.280
All right, David. What is the news?

40:46.281 --> 40:47.549
What does the data tell us?

40:47.550 --> 40:48.983
Well, we maxed out our sensors.

40:48.984 --> 40:51.152
We... what... wait a minute.

40:51.153 --> 40:54.221
We had, like, 500- and 600-G
crashes last time,

40:54.222 --> 40:56.090
but what was our max?

40:56.091 --> 40:58.325
More than 800 G's.

40:58.326 --> 41:00.795
Wow! And we don't know how much worse.

41:00.796 --> 41:02.697
It's just above 800 G's?

41:02.698 --> 41:04.131
- That's correct.
- Okay.

41:04.132 --> 41:05.399
Thank you, sir.

41:05.400 --> 41:06.400
Whew.

41:06.401 --> 41:08.302
So, with the G's maxing out

41:08.303 --> 41:11.272
at eight times the survivable limit,

41:11.273 --> 41:13.340
there's only one conclusion to make.

41:13.341 --> 41:14.742
So, let's recap.

41:14.743 --> 41:16.177
In the first crash,

41:16.178 --> 41:19.246
our perp was seated alone
in the back seat,

41:19.247 --> 41:22.684
and on impact, withstood
500 to 600 G's of force,

41:22.685 --> 41:25.119
a completely deadly amount of G's.

41:25.120 --> 41:28.022
In the second crash,
seated between two big cops,

41:28.023 --> 41:29.423
this being one of them,

41:29.424 --> 41:32.994
he withstood well over 800,
and that was totally counter

41:32.995 --> 41:35.396
to what both Jamie and I predicted.

41:35.397 --> 41:38.066
The second crash was far worse.

41:38.067 --> 41:39.701
Ain't that the truth?

41:39.702 --> 41:42.670
The two corpulent cops
didn't <i>shield</i> the suspect,

41:42.671 --> 41:44.105
they <i>killed</i> him.

41:44.106 --> 41:46.808
And Jamie's figured out why.

41:46.809 --> 41:49.777
Earlier, I thought any padding
would be good padding

41:49.778 --> 41:52.080
and that our dummy would be better off

41:52.081 --> 41:53.547
between the two big guys,

41:53.548 --> 41:55.683
but it turns out I was wrong.

41:55.684 --> 41:59.186
Water doesn't compress,
and we're mostly water.

41:59.187 --> 42:00.554
So, it was actually

42:00.555 --> 42:03.992
like our dummy was between
a rock and a hard place.

42:03.993 --> 42:05.226
How do you want to call this one?

42:05.227 --> 42:07.261
Well, it was totally
not what we expected.

42:07.262 --> 42:09.664
You'd be much worse off
in the back of a car

42:09.665 --> 42:10.932
between two big guys

42:10.933 --> 42:12.900
than to not have them there
in the first place.

42:12.901 --> 42:14.535
The myth is busted.

42:14.536 --> 42:16.270
Copy that. It's totally busted.

42:16.271 --> 42:17.772
Let's get out of here.

42:17.773 --> 42:18.873
Whoa.

42:22.945 --> 42:25.947

didn't do something on the show?
