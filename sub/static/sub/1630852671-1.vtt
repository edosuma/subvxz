WEBVTT

00:29.690 --> 00:33.374
Maddie, I'm sorry
for all the years

00:33.406 --> 00:36.482
lost, the pain and
suffering that I caused you.

00:39.280 --> 00:43.164
I wish I could see you
with my own eyes again,

00:43.196 --> 00:44.555
but it's too late for me now.

00:48.591 --> 00:53.234
I only ever wanted to be
the dad you wanted me to be.

00:53.266 --> 00:57.470
And for that, I
will die in regret.

00:57.502 --> 01:01.985
But please know this,
I lived with such pride

01:02.017 --> 01:03.256
having you as my daughter.

01:06.493 --> 01:12.336
This is my confession to you
for everything, what I did

01:12.367 --> 01:14.812
and why I did it.

01:14.844 --> 01:18.680
It'll hurt, but it'll
set you free too.

01:23.236 --> 01:28.950
I know you think what this
is, what I am, but you don't.

01:31.668 --> 01:35.791
Once I've given this
truth to Father Peter,

01:35.823 --> 01:39.788
his world will be
blown apart, but it's

01:39.819 --> 01:41.577
time to try and put
right what I can.

01:44.855 --> 01:47.372
All this will end tonight.

03:45.214 --> 03:48.659
I'm afraid I was just about
to lock up for the night.

04:04.474 --> 04:05.721
Well, I'm afraid...

04:09.670 --> 04:11.915
Take one more step I'll blow
your fucking brains out.

04:11.947 --> 04:12.874
I talk you listen.

04:12.906 --> 04:15.592
You understand?

04:15.623 --> 04:17.869
How many exit points are
there in this church?

04:17.901 --> 04:19.109
Why would you want to know that?

04:19.140 --> 04:21.986
Answer the fucking question.

04:22.017 --> 04:25.222
Uh, four.

04:25.254 --> 04:26.572
Start by locking this one.

04:33.125 --> 04:34.445
Look at the door, not of me.

04:37.801 --> 04:48.639
Good.

04:48.670 --> 04:49.070
Move.

04:54.824 --> 04:55.464
It's locked.

05:02.177 --> 05:06.181
You know, If you don't
get that seen to,

05:06.213 --> 05:09.138
you're going to be in
serious trouble in no time.

05:09.169 --> 05:10.049
It's too late for me.

05:13.006 --> 05:15.652
I'm already dead.

05:15.683 --> 05:19.608
What is it you want here?

05:19.639 --> 05:25.074
This is a house of worship,
a house of God, not violence.

05:27.671 --> 05:30.756
Do you think I want
to be here doing this?

05:30.788 --> 05:37.230
I'm just trying to understand
what's happened to you.

05:37.261 --> 05:38.460
What do you want?

05:42.536 --> 05:47.659
I want the same
things as you do,

05:47.691 --> 05:48.930
for people to know the truth.

05:51.527 --> 05:52.007
Let's go.

07:08.890 --> 07:12.695
At least let me get
you some painkillers.

07:12.726 --> 07:14.812
All right.

07:27.031 --> 07:30.077
You got anything stronger?

08:06.273 --> 08:09.637
I've seen enough
gunshot wounds to know

08:09.669 --> 08:11.196
that if I don't
treat you now you're

08:11.228 --> 08:14.832
going to die right here
in front of my alter.

08:14.864 --> 08:15.903
I'm not going to have that.

08:31.048 --> 08:34.173
I'm going to have to cauterize
it, stop the bleeding till we

08:34.204 --> 08:36.410
get you to a hospital.

08:36.442 --> 08:39.088
We're not going to
a fucking hospital.

08:39.119 --> 08:39.839
You got a belt?

08:44.075 --> 08:44.914
Bite down on it.

09:06.532 --> 09:07.092
Ready?

09:32.507 --> 09:33.466
Just once more, OK?

10:02.916 --> 10:04.914
The bleeding slowed for now.

10:07.951 --> 10:11.316
I'm going to have to dress
it, though, keep infection out

10:11.347 --> 10:12.547
of the sun already in there.

10:15.263 --> 10:17.789
I've got a gear big enough.

10:17.821 --> 10:18.948
I'm going to check out back.

10:18.979 --> 10:20.547
Oh, forget it.

10:20.578 --> 10:23.304
I have to wrap that.

10:23.336 --> 10:25.094
I'm only doing what's necessary.

10:31.008 --> 10:31.327
OK, wait.

10:35.163 --> 10:36.801
Give me your keys
and your cell phone.

12:13.025 --> 12:14.464
What the hell are
you doing in there?

12:50.188 --> 12:51.355
Don't make me come in there!

12:57.341 --> 12:57.861
Hey!

13:16.122 --> 13:20.086
What the hell are
you doing back there?

13:20.118 --> 13:21.525
I'm sorry.

13:21.557 --> 13:24.083
Sorry, I haven't been able
to use that medical equipment

13:24.115 --> 13:25.680
in years.

13:25.712 --> 13:27.391
Just give me a minute, OK?

13:50.089 --> 13:51.527
Come on, come on.

13:58.520 --> 14:01.037
Please, God, please.

14:17.740 --> 14:18.300
Come on.

14:25.253 --> 14:26.812
Come on, Come on.

14:44.513 --> 14:45.593
I'd turn the fuck around.

14:51.107 --> 14:52.106
Don't make me ask twice.

15:02.775 --> 15:03.855
Get out of my fucking way.

15:24.434 --> 15:24.793
Move.

16:11.506 --> 16:11.907
OK.

16:31.686 --> 16:32.286
Smoke?

16:35.642 --> 16:36.882
We are all sinners.

17:07.451 --> 17:11.216
So, you know who I am.

17:11.247 --> 17:12.206
What do we call you?

17:16.042 --> 17:18.168
Victor strong.

17:18.200 --> 17:18.799
You're Catholic?

17:22.515 --> 17:23.834
A long time ago.

17:27.671 --> 17:31.155
Well, he's always
there no matter what.

17:31.187 --> 17:37.948
I wouldn't be so sure,
not after what I've done.

17:37.980 --> 17:42.623
Forgiveness isn't just a word.

17:42.655 --> 17:46.500
It's what faith is all about.

17:46.531 --> 17:50.816
If God exists, he's got a
funny way of showing it.

17:50.848 --> 17:54.324
We all change, evolve.

17:59.319 --> 18:03.603
No matter what happens
in our personal journey,

18:03.634 --> 18:08.158
you can always
reconnect, no matter

18:08.190 --> 18:11.635
how disillusioned you become.

18:11.667 --> 18:14.224
No one stopped the two bullets
ripping through me, did they?

18:16.981 --> 18:18.420
We all have choices.

18:21.776 --> 18:24.263
It's called free will.

18:24.294 --> 18:26.021
And what good did that do me?

18:26.052 --> 18:28.778
I'm sitting here bleeding to
death in your fucking church.

18:28.810 --> 18:34.812
Know this, he is still
watching over you

18:34.844 --> 18:35.882
no matter what's happened.

18:42.435 --> 18:48.318
Perhaps now is the
time to reach out.

18:48.350 --> 18:51.227
All you have to do
is ask for his help.

18:53.984 --> 18:55.023
If only it was that easy.

19:08.490 --> 19:16.282
I know you think what this
is, what I am, but you don't.

19:19.159 --> 19:23.123
I'm not here to
judge you, Victor.

19:23.155 --> 19:24.594
I just want to understand.

19:27.910 --> 19:35.462
Everything I ever did was for
these two, Jessie and Madison.

19:40.617 --> 19:42.176
Was this your wife and daughter?

19:46.012 --> 19:48.290
Up until 9 years ago when
it all went up in smoke.

19:54.523 --> 19:55.482
Where are they now?

20:08.149 --> 20:13.713
Do Jessie and
Madison have anything

20:13.744 --> 20:15.543
to do with what's
happened to you tonight?

20:19.020 --> 20:23.183
It only happened because
I didn't stand my ground

20:23.215 --> 20:24.734
and be the man I
should have been.

20:27.611 --> 20:30.096
Well, if you tell
me where they are,

20:30.128 --> 20:31.366
I can make sure they're OK.

20:35.882 --> 20:37.040
You're not listening to me.

20:39.678 --> 20:42.883
Well, you want to make
sure they're OK, don't you?

20:42.915 --> 20:45.400
Don't you, Victor?

20:45.432 --> 20:46.671
They everything to me.

20:49.669 --> 20:50.628
They always have been.

20:53.505 --> 20:56.630
I can see that.

20:56.662 --> 20:59.706
So the first thing we
need to do is make sure

20:59.738 --> 21:01.065
that none of what's
happened tonight

21:01.097 --> 21:03.215
has hurt them in any way.

21:08.010 --> 21:11.454
What are you fucking saying?

21:11.486 --> 21:14.692
I just want to understand.

21:14.723 --> 21:18.648
You need to stop with your
understanding bullshit.

21:18.679 --> 21:23.762
Well, I want to make
sure they're OK.

21:23.794 --> 21:26.200
Is that so wrong?

21:26.232 --> 21:29.077
Do you honestly think
it could have hurt them?

21:29.109 --> 21:31.634
Do you?

21:31.666 --> 21:32.945
You need to answer me.

21:37.021 --> 21:38.668
Answer me right now
or I will show you

21:38.699 --> 21:40.617
what hurting someone
fucking looks like.

22:02.515 --> 22:05.041
You can threaten
me all you like.

22:05.072 --> 22:07.151
I'm an on old man,
I've had my life.

22:11.985 --> 22:17.869
But if you've hurt your wife,
your own flesh and blood,

22:17.900 --> 22:19.139
what kind of man are you?

22:29.888 --> 22:34.811
You see, You're not
so understanding now.

22:34.843 --> 22:36.090
Stop playing game.

22:36.122 --> 22:37.329
I'm not.

22:37.361 --> 22:39.207
Then do what you say
you've never done.

22:39.239 --> 22:40.886
Yeah, what's that?

22:40.917 --> 22:45.880
Face up to your transgressions,
admit to all you've done.

22:45.912 --> 22:47.838
Every damn skeleton
is coming out tonight,

22:47.870 --> 22:48.917
I promise you that.

22:48.949 --> 22:50.276
Well, tell me where they are.

22:50.307 --> 22:51.834
It's not as simple as that.

22:51.866 --> 22:55.071
It's only as complicated
as you want to make it.

22:55.102 --> 23:00.705
You live in your fucking
church, all high and mighty,

23:00.737 --> 23:03.223
thinking the answer
to everything.

23:03.255 --> 23:04.782
Let me tell you
something, you know

23:04.814 --> 23:07.779
nothing about the real world.

23:07.810 --> 23:10.735
You hear me?

23:10.767 --> 23:12.893
Nothing.

23:12.925 --> 23:17.048
You don't know a
single thing about me.

23:17.080 --> 23:20.925
So your assumptions
mean nothing.

23:20.956 --> 23:24.882
I know the world is
hard for many, that's

23:24.913 --> 23:26.800
why I chose to help people.

23:26.831 --> 23:27.790
That's why I'm a priest.

23:30.947 --> 23:35.111
I believe there's a
reason for everything.

23:35.143 --> 23:40.745
More importantly, I
believe in humanity.

23:40.777 --> 23:49.576
That everyone, deep
down, is born good,

23:49.608 --> 23:52.126
that they just lose their way.

23:57.959 --> 24:01.565
You honestly believe
you make a difference?

24:01.596 --> 24:05.360
I know as much as the next guy.

24:05.392 --> 24:09.716
I know the world
is a sick place.

24:09.748 --> 24:14.023
It's full of hate, full
of violence and greed.

24:17.140 --> 24:23.822
So whatever happens tonight,
when I meet my maker,

24:23.853 --> 24:28.250
at least I can say I tried
to make a difference.

24:31.486 --> 24:32.645
Can you say the same?

24:42.156 --> 24:45.232
I'm a sinner, just like you.

24:48.230 --> 24:48.788
Then repent.

24:51.346 --> 24:52.785
Tell me where they are.

24:57.980 --> 25:00.826
Where's Madison?

25:00.857 --> 25:02.343
I don't know.

25:02.375 --> 25:03.223
Where is she?

25:03.254 --> 25:04.421
I don't know.

25:04.453 --> 25:06.100
When was the last
time you saw her?

25:06.132 --> 25:08.258
About six years ago.

25:08.290 --> 25:09.218
Stop lying.

25:09.249 --> 25:10.256
It's the truth.

25:10.288 --> 25:11.255
Well, what about Jesse?

25:11.287 --> 25:13.293
What about your wife?

25:13.325 --> 25:16.370
Answer me.

25:16.401 --> 25:17.010
Answer me.

25:17.041 --> 25:17.880
She's dead.

25:56.281 --> 25:59.845
When did Jesse depart?

25:59.877 --> 26:00.997
She's been gone nine years.

26:04.233 --> 26:05.671
I was a different man back then.

26:13.944 --> 26:15.063
Did you have a good marriage?

26:21.496 --> 26:22.096
The best.

26:25.093 --> 26:30.335
We had our ups and
downs couples don't.

26:30.367 --> 26:35.291
In sickness and in health,
for better or for worse,

26:35.322 --> 26:37.080
you got to work
on relationships.

26:41.116 --> 26:47.359
I was content, happy
with everything I had,

26:47.390 --> 26:51.147
Jessie was more career-driven.

26:53.904 --> 26:56.949
I was happy just to
have a secure job.

26:56.981 --> 26:59.186
We had our home,
Maddie came along.

26:59.218 --> 27:02.504
What else did we need?

27:02.536 --> 27:04.413
But Jesse had other ideas?

27:08.489 --> 27:12.094
She was very ambitious,
wanted to get

27:12.126 --> 27:13.244
to the top no matter what.

27:17.400 --> 27:19.438
And this caused
friction between you.

27:22.875 --> 27:25.080
Right.

27:25.112 --> 27:28.117
Find me a partnership that
doesn't have friction.

27:28.149 --> 27:30.436
It's normal.

27:30.467 --> 27:34.152
No two or identical, we
all have different needs.

27:34.184 --> 27:37.149
I get that.

27:37.181 --> 27:42.304
But I have never jeopardized our
family home for a fucking job.

27:42.335 --> 27:44.901
And you think she did
that intentionally?

27:44.933 --> 27:47.218
I told her over and over again
be happy with what you got,

27:47.250 --> 27:50.096
but she wouldn't listen to me.

27:50.127 --> 27:51.167
Thought I worried too much.

27:55.003 --> 27:56.281
Well, how did that
make you feel?

28:04.593 --> 28:12.394
Like that wasn't enough for
her, like we weren't enough.

28:26.691 --> 28:31.215
The old adage, you don't know
what you've got till it's gone.

28:31.246 --> 28:32.293
Not me.

28:32.325 --> 28:33.572
I knew exactly what we had.

28:33.604 --> 28:34.922
I was terrified of losing it.

28:37.560 --> 28:42.204
As you've said it yourself,
the world is a sick place.

28:42.235 --> 28:44.481
All I wanted to do was look
after those inside my home,

28:44.513 --> 28:50.995
but Jessie made it
impossible for me to do that.

28:51.027 --> 28:54.223
Well, you can't
do it on your own.

28:57.500 --> 28:59.986
You both have to have the
same ideals or at least

29:00.017 --> 29:04.541
an understanding to compromise.

29:04.573 --> 29:06.211
She'd always do it her way.

29:15.401 --> 29:16.281
How old is Madison?

29:19.518 --> 29:20.956
She'll be 19 next month.

29:25.272 --> 29:33.073
Oh, what a tragedy, to lose
your mom at such a tender age.

29:33.105 --> 29:39.427
I don't know what's worse, your
mom dying or your dad running

29:39.459 --> 29:40.017
out on you.

29:49.727 --> 29:50.686
What happened to Jesse?

29:58.359 --> 29:59.158
She was murdered.

30:11.346 --> 30:14.911
I was always scared our
life together wouldn't last.

30:14.943 --> 30:19.227
It's like I had a sixth
sense or something.

30:19.258 --> 30:21.025
I tried to put it to
the back of my mind,

30:21.057 --> 30:23.654
but it was always there.

30:28.449 --> 30:29.688
How did Jesse die?

30:36.281 --> 30:38.327
I didn't go away very
often, but occasionally, I'd

30:38.359 --> 30:41.084
take overtime.

30:41.116 --> 30:45.280
I was saving some cash for
the girls for a vacation.

30:45.311 --> 30:47.558
Now, what I didn't
know was that by then,

30:47.590 --> 30:50.755
Jesse was in some serious shit.

30:50.787 --> 30:56.150
She was in deep with
some bad people.

30:56.182 --> 30:57.500
I'll let you know
when it's done.

31:03.374 --> 31:07.659
Is that the last
time you saw her?

31:07.690 --> 31:11.814
The night before I
left, we had a fight.

31:11.845 --> 31:15.530
I don't even remember
what it was about.

31:15.562 --> 31:20.206
Some stupid shit, dirty
dishes or something.

31:20.237 --> 31:24.042
And when we went to bed,
she was still mad at me.

31:24.073 --> 31:25.631
She left before I woke
up in the morning.

31:28.508 --> 31:31.385
Next thing I know, I was in the
morgue identifying her body.

31:44.493 --> 31:45.811
I am so sorry.

31:50.406 --> 31:53.772
She was shot dead on
the side of the street.

31:53.804 --> 31:56.489
They said it was a
robbery that went wrong.

31:56.521 --> 31:58.488
It wasn't?

31:58.519 --> 32:01.116
She took two bullets to the
chest and one to the head.

32:03.833 --> 32:05.680
That's not some
crackhead son of a bitch

32:05.712 --> 32:08.716
trying to take your
fucking purse, that's

32:08.748 --> 32:11.674
a professional hit.

32:25.732 --> 32:28.417
What the fuck was that?

32:28.449 --> 32:30.654
Is there someone here you
haven't told me about?

32:30.686 --> 32:32.165
There's only me,
I can assure you.

32:47.150 --> 32:47.758
Wait.

32:47.790 --> 32:50.116
Touch me again.

32:50.147 --> 32:52.553
When you first got here, you
asked me to check the doors?

32:52.585 --> 32:54.112
Yeah, what?

32:54.144 --> 32:56.421
The door in there it was
opened before I locked it.

33:01.575 --> 33:03.302
Why didn't you tell me?

33:03.333 --> 33:04.421
You had a gun to my head.

33:14.523 --> 33:17.608
When I was in there looking for
something to bandage you with...

33:17.640 --> 33:18.927
Yeah, what?

33:18.959 --> 33:22.315
I think I might have heard
something or someone.

33:37.779 --> 33:40.865
Take one more step
and I will put

33:40.897 --> 33:42.895
a hole in your fucking skull.

33:50.567 --> 33:54.203
Get over here.

34:05.391 --> 34:09.716
Do you have anything
to say for yourself?

34:09.748 --> 34:12.952
I should just shoot you
in the fucking face.

34:12.984 --> 34:14.751
Just take a step back.

34:14.782 --> 34:16.350
Why should I listen to you?

34:16.381 --> 34:17.548
Give me a reason.

34:17.580 --> 34:19.826
Because I'm here
and I want to help.

34:19.857 --> 34:22.583
I saw you helping
the son of a bitch.

34:22.615 --> 34:23.901
I don't know what you think.

34:23.933 --> 34:27.818
I saw you helping a
murdering scumbag.

34:27.850 --> 34:29.856
You picked your side.

34:29.887 --> 34:32.253
This is a church, in
case you haven't noticed,

34:32.285 --> 34:33.532
and I'm a priest.

34:33.564 --> 34:36.928
That doesn't give
you a free pass.

34:36.960 --> 34:41.564
This man, Victor, he came in
here with a gunshot wound.

34:41.595 --> 34:43.282
I see you know his fucking name.

34:43.314 --> 34:44.920
Do you think I am stupid?

34:44.951 --> 34:51.554
He came in here, just as you
have now, pointing a gun at me

34:51.585 --> 34:53.872
and telling me what I
must and mustn't do.

34:53.904 --> 34:57.747
You could have told him to
fuck off and get the hell out.

34:57.779 --> 34:59.626
When you're looking down
the barrel of a gun,

34:59.658 --> 35:02.623
it doesn't matter who's
pointing it at you.

35:02.655 --> 35:03.614
You do what you're told.

35:06.850 --> 35:08.489
Did you see me lock
the back doors?

35:11.485 --> 35:11.934
Yeah.

35:11.965 --> 35:14.211
So what?

35:14.243 --> 35:16.729
Did it look like he
and I were friends?

35:16.761 --> 35:18.327
If I knew you were
hiding in there,

35:18.359 --> 35:19.805
you wouldn't be breathing now.

35:19.837 --> 35:22.283
Shut your mouth.

35:22.315 --> 35:24.041
You're not helping.

35:24.073 --> 35:26.351
Look, take a deep breath.

35:33.903 --> 35:40.985
You had a
chance to get out.

35:41.016 --> 35:41.944
Why did you hang around?

35:41.975 --> 35:42.743
I didn't.

35:42.774 --> 35:44.101
No.

35:44.133 --> 35:47.330
He made me lock all the
doors and took away my keys.

35:51.805 --> 35:53.004
Who were you trying to call?

35:55.881 --> 35:57.368
What?

35:57.400 --> 35:59.087
What do you expect?

35:59.118 --> 36:00.965
You said you were
here to help people.

36:00.996 --> 36:04.681
I am, but I had
to evaluate risk.

36:04.713 --> 36:06.839
You're not different
from the rest.

36:06.870 --> 36:07.997
Oh, really, yeah?

36:08.028 --> 36:09.596
And what would you
do in my shoes?

36:09.628 --> 36:10.595
Jesus, shut up.

36:10.627 --> 36:11.665
Shut the fuck up.

36:17.539 --> 36:19.706
Victor Strong, I
am arresting you

36:19.737 --> 36:21.743
on suspicion of the
illegal trafficking

36:21.775 --> 36:24.501
of class-A narcotics, the
illegal transportation

36:24.532 --> 36:28.537
of weapons, kidnap,
false imprisonment,

36:28.569 --> 36:29.927
wounding with
intent, and murder.

36:33.124 --> 36:34.770
You have the right
to remain silent.

36:34.802 --> 36:35.969
Anything you do,
say can and will

36:36.001 --> 36:37.648
be used against you
in a court of law.

36:37.679 --> 36:38.966
You have the right
to an attorney.

36:38.997 --> 36:40.644
If you cannot
afford an attorney,

36:40.676 --> 36:41.995
one will be appointed for you.

36:44.711 --> 36:46.638
Put these on.

36:46.670 --> 36:48.428
Put them on.

36:59.777 --> 37:02.104
Help him.

37:02.135 --> 37:02.734
Help him.

37:08.368 --> 37:11.134
Move, move!

37:27.950 --> 37:29.436
Sit your asses down.

37:29.467 --> 37:31.625
Sit, sit.

37:45.092 --> 37:46.371
How do I know you're a cop?

37:57.759 --> 38:00.125
Is anything you told me true?

38:00.157 --> 38:01.204
Every damn word.

38:01.235 --> 38:02.523
He's a fucking maniac.

38:02.555 --> 38:06.159
Don't listen to a
word that he says.

38:06.191 --> 38:09.835
Have you committed the crimes
that State Trooper Willow

38:09.867 --> 38:11.554
Wallace says you have?

38:11.585 --> 38:13.871
You have to do certain things
in life that you really

38:13.902 --> 38:14.671
don't want to do.

38:14.702 --> 38:15.749
You know that.

38:15.781 --> 38:17.028
It's called sacrifice.

38:17.060 --> 38:18.507
Oh, bullshit.

38:18.538 --> 38:21.224
Making millions from
worldwide criminal activity

38:21.255 --> 38:25.460
and ripping societies apart by
feeding addiction and violence

38:25.492 --> 38:26.978
has nothing to do
with sacrifice.

38:27.010 --> 38:27.650
It's greed.

38:30.287 --> 38:33.851
I have to agree if
what she says is true.

38:33.883 --> 38:36.848
You know more than
anyone, Father,

38:36.880 --> 38:38.966
that looking beyond
what is in front of you

38:38.998 --> 38:43.961
requires great courage
and introspection.

38:43.993 --> 38:45.439
You have more
blood on your hands

38:45.471 --> 38:47.598
than anyone I've
ever encountered.

38:47.629 --> 38:50.507
You can spin this any way you
want, you're not fooling me.

38:53.783 --> 38:56.988
What are you talking about?

38:57.020 --> 38:58.547
Who's this act for?

38:58.578 --> 39:00.345
You think I don't know
what's really going on?

39:00.377 --> 39:01.904
Oh, you think you
do but you don't.

39:01.936 --> 39:03.581
Stop the bullshit,
I'm not buying it.

39:03.613 --> 39:04.901
And whether he is or
not makes no difference.

39:04.932 --> 39:06.219
You're going to kill him anyway.

39:06.251 --> 39:07.898
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
I don't know what's

39:07.929 --> 39:09.216
going on between
the pair of you,

39:09.248 --> 39:12.213
but whatever it is,
we can resolve it

39:12.244 --> 39:14.930
here and now without any
more blood being spilt.

39:14.962 --> 39:17.927
Like I said, Father, you need
to look further than what's

39:17.958 --> 39:19.486
in front of your eyes.

39:19.517 --> 39:21.124
She couldn't resolve this
now even if she wanted to.

39:21.156 --> 39:25.559
Her strings are being pulled by
something far greater than her.

39:25.591 --> 39:28.628
Says the dirty ex-cop
who got thrown in jail.

39:31.145 --> 39:32.912
You were a cop?

39:32.944 --> 39:35.309
Oh, he didn't tell
you that part?

39:35.341 --> 39:36.789
I thought he might leave it out.

39:36.820 --> 39:38.067
Shut your mouth.

39:38.098 --> 39:40.864
All you do is lie.

39:40.896 --> 39:41.704
You don't know me.

39:41.735 --> 39:45.140
I wish that were true.

39:45.172 --> 39:46.091
Enlighten me.

39:51.046 --> 39:54.571
I know that after the
tragic death of his wife,

39:54.602 --> 39:57.567
he pushed back
against the system.

39:57.599 --> 39:59.646
I know that his
attitude to crime

39:59.677 --> 40:01.763
changed and he started
helping the people he

40:01.794 --> 40:05.200
should have been arresting.

40:05.232 --> 40:08.716
He gave up the home
address of a cop.

40:08.747 --> 40:10.315
An innocent man
is going to spend

40:10.346 --> 40:13.712
the rest of his life eating
through a fucking straw because

40:13.744 --> 40:15.309
of you.

40:15.341 --> 40:17.268
Do you actually believe
what you're saying?

40:17.299 --> 40:19.905
You really think it
went down that way?

40:19.937 --> 40:22.343
So you don't deny it?

40:22.375 --> 40:25.260
All he's interested in
is treading on people

40:25.291 --> 40:26.978
until he gets what he wants.

40:27.009 --> 40:30.615
And when he does, he doesn't
give the injured or the dead

40:30.646 --> 40:31.804
a second thought.

40:34.843 --> 40:36.800
Wouldn't you love
to take those off?

40:40.117 --> 40:42.322
How would you do it?

40:42.354 --> 40:44.592
Would you take my
gun and shoot me?

40:47.789 --> 40:48.787
Would you use your fists?

40:52.305 --> 40:55.390
What would you give to wrap
your hands around my throat

40:55.421 --> 40:56.301
to stop me talking?

41:02.854 --> 41:05.219
I'll give you a chance
to do the right thing.

41:05.251 --> 41:08.258
Or what are you going to do?

41:08.289 --> 41:09.336
I'll make you regret it.

41:09.368 --> 41:11.853
No, no, no, stop all this.

41:11.885 --> 41:14.650
I'm warning you.

41:14.681 --> 41:17.128
Make her regret, how?

41:17.160 --> 41:20.684
Is threatening all you can do?

41:20.715 --> 41:24.760
Why don't you tell the priest
what violence is like for you?

41:24.792 --> 41:28.117
How is it for you?

41:28.148 --> 41:30.754
If I've ever used force, it
has been in the line of duty.

41:30.786 --> 41:32.832
That's the bullshit
you hide behind.

41:32.864 --> 41:35.310
If you want to hear the truth,
you need to start speaking it

41:35.342 --> 41:37.348
yourself.

41:37.379 --> 41:39.186
Don't turn this around on me.

41:39.218 --> 41:42.023
I am doing my job.

41:42.055 --> 41:43.262
Tell me the truth.

41:43.294 --> 41:45.979
I'll tell you the truth.

41:46.011 --> 41:48.856
He spent years becoming
the most feared criminal

41:48.888 --> 41:50.774
in the state of Massachusetts.

41:50.806 --> 41:53.651
He's a fucking animal.

41:53.683 --> 41:56.680
Stop hiding who you
are and start speaking.

42:02.274 --> 42:05.639
I was found guilty of
corruption in a public office.

42:05.671 --> 42:07.317
They kicked me out of
the police department

42:07.349 --> 42:10.035
and threw me in jail.

42:10.066 --> 42:12.033
I was facing 10 years
jail time if they

42:12.065 --> 42:14.990
could make the charges stick.

42:15.021 --> 42:15.661
They couldn't.

42:20.776 --> 42:24.501
You know what I've always
struggled to figure out?

42:24.532 --> 42:29.096
Did the death of Jesse
cause you to be like this,

42:29.127 --> 42:32.444
or is it you being like this
that cost the death of Jesse?

42:48.748 --> 42:52.313
This is the respect
that he has for the law,

42:52.344 --> 42:55.190
shooting a state trooper who
was offering him a way out.

42:55.222 --> 42:57.867
If I didn't shoot you
I'd be dead already.

42:57.898 --> 43:00.585
Tonight I offered him a way out.

43:00.616 --> 43:02.822
I told him since we still
have a case against him,

43:02.854 --> 43:06.339
he's going to be arrested sooner
or later so he's not buried

43:06.371 --> 43:07.769
in a shallow grave first.

43:10.246 --> 43:12.293
All he had to do
was come in with me.

43:12.324 --> 43:13.851
We would give him
witness protection,

43:13.883 --> 43:17.848
he would give us
his organization.

43:17.879 --> 43:19.286
You lying bitch.

43:19.317 --> 43:22.483
He could have refused, he could
have walked away and taken

43:22.514 --> 43:25.839
his chances, but the unhinged
lunatic preferred to shoot out.

43:25.871 --> 43:30.155
You shot me first without
so much as a word.

43:30.187 --> 43:32.751
Who are you going to believe?

43:32.783 --> 43:35.310
A state trooper or
this piece of shit?

43:35.341 --> 43:42.303
If he's who you say he
is, where's your backup?

43:42.334 --> 43:44.820
Good question.

43:44.852 --> 43:46.178
They're on their way.

43:46.210 --> 43:47.098
And when they get here
you're going to be in a box

43:47.129 --> 43:47.777
where you belong.

43:47.809 --> 43:49.016
A box?

43:49.047 --> 43:51.254
A cage, a box, you
know what I mean.

43:51.286 --> 43:54.011
If I'm a criminal as high
profile as you say I am,

43:54.043 --> 43:55.289
why are they not here already?

43:55.321 --> 43:58.127
They will get here
when they get here.

43:58.159 --> 44:02.522
I'm blowing the lid on
this entire thing tonight.

44:02.554 --> 44:03.361
No, please.

44:03.393 --> 44:03.993
No, don't.

44:16.261 --> 44:18.987
You had a loose
connection there, Father,

44:19.018 --> 44:21.864
I fixed it for you.

44:21.895 --> 44:25.579
Your back up need
directions now?

44:25.611 --> 44:29.855
I want you to watch him while
they go pick up the phone.

44:29.887 --> 44:30.965
Can you deal with that?

44:33.962 --> 44:37.168
It'll be my backup calling
to give further instructions.

44:37.200 --> 44:38.877
They traced the call
on the landline.

44:42.234 --> 44:45.559
You can do this.

44:45.591 --> 44:47.118
Yes.

44:47.149 --> 44:50.474
Yeah, I can do it.

44:50.505 --> 44:53.391
I'll go pick up the phone
and see what's happening

44:53.423 --> 44:54.551
and I'll be right back.

44:54.582 --> 44:56.588
OK?

44:56.620 --> 44:57.219
Yes.

45:09.247 --> 45:10.494
Sit back down.

45:10.526 --> 45:11.653
Tell me you don't
believe this bullshit.

45:11.685 --> 45:13.052
We need to act now
or we're both dead.

45:13.084 --> 45:14.650
I don't want to hear
any more from you.

45:14.682 --> 45:16.448
Come on, think.

45:16.480 --> 45:18.166
We don't have time for this.

45:18.198 --> 45:19.965
She's a cop.

45:19.996 --> 45:21.244
We do what she says.

45:21.275 --> 45:22.642
You're got to make
me do something

45:22.674 --> 45:23.920
I really don't want to do.

45:26.190 --> 45:26.829
This is Willow.

45:29.907 --> 45:32.344
Yeah, I put them
both in my control.

45:39.537 --> 45:41.063
Take off my shoe.

45:41.095 --> 45:41.543
What?

45:41.575 --> 45:42.342
Why?

45:42.374 --> 45:44.060
Just fucking do it.

45:44.092 --> 45:44.452
Come on.

45:47.489 --> 45:48.089
Give it to me.

45:56.720 --> 45:59.445
I've been undercover
for of years.

45:59.477 --> 46:00.884
I'm still a cop.

46:00.916 --> 46:02.523
That bitch in there she's
a liar, she's dirty.

46:02.554 --> 46:06.359
It's me who's
discovered the truth.

46:06.390 --> 46:08.636
We need to act now.

46:08.668 --> 46:10.913
She's going to come back
here and kill both of us.

46:10.945 --> 46:13.311
You need to go and get my gun.

46:13.343 --> 46:14.990
Father, listen to me.

46:15.022 --> 46:18.186
Peter, we're both going to die
unless you're going get my gun.

46:18.218 --> 46:20.384
You have to go now.

46:20.416 --> 46:22.342
Go.

46:22.374 --> 46:22.974
Quick.

46:25.731 --> 46:27.649
You don't want me to
wait until you get here?

46:31.246 --> 46:33.451
No, I can handle that.

46:33.483 --> 46:35.161
I've said I can
fucking handle it.

46:49.547 --> 46:50.506
What about the priest?

46:56.301 --> 47:00.185
No, I don't have a
problem with that.

47:00.216 --> 47:00.815
Just get here.

47:31.665 --> 47:34.502
You disappoint me, Father Peter.

47:38.138 --> 47:41.703
When you took a vow to
join the priesthood,

47:41.735 --> 47:44.612
didn't that also come
with abiding by the law?

47:52.284 --> 47:58.166
All I asked you to do was
your duty as a citizen,

47:58.197 --> 48:02.753
as a man of God, and watch
over a wanted criminal.

48:07.708 --> 48:09.387
You've chosen to
listen to him instead.

48:12.463 --> 48:13.024
Big mistake.

48:32.444 --> 48:33.243
How cute.

48:37.398 --> 48:38.997
Do you think this
makes a difference?

48:44.472 --> 48:48.556
Whatever Strong has told
you, he is an outlaw

48:48.588 --> 48:53.024
and I am here to arrest him,
with or without your help.

49:10.806 --> 49:14.251
If you don't reveal
yourself now,

49:14.282 --> 49:19.405
Father, not only will
you lose this church,

49:19.437 --> 49:21.355
you will also lose your liberty.

49:27.788 --> 49:29.186
Last chance, Father.

49:44.492 --> 49:45.651
You don't have to do this.

49:50.726 --> 49:54.490
If you give up
your organization,

49:54.522 --> 49:58.166
that can get you into a
witness protection program.

49:58.198 --> 49:59.557
All you got to do
is drop the gun.

50:05.311 --> 50:08.668
Thanks for the offer,
but I think I'll pass.

50:12.544 --> 50:13.623
You're making a big mistake.

50:17.339 --> 50:21.623
The difference between
you and me, Strong,

50:21.655 --> 50:23.740
is that I know
where I'm heading,

50:23.772 --> 50:27.536
and I won't crash out
at the last moment.

50:27.568 --> 50:31.006
You're just another piece
of shit standing in my way.

51:01.894 --> 51:03.212
It's OK, Father.

51:07.928 --> 51:10.015
It's OK.

51:10.046 --> 51:13.012
You did what you had to do.

51:13.043 --> 51:16.567
Stop talking.

51:16.599 --> 51:18.646
I don't want to
hear another word.

51:18.678 --> 51:21.842
She was going to kill me and
then she was going to kill you.

51:21.874 --> 51:23.801
You had no choice.

51:23.832 --> 51:25.391
You did the only
thing you could.

51:28.987 --> 51:29.835
Talk to me.

51:29.866 --> 51:31.952
It was either her or us.

51:31.984 --> 51:32.583
Say it.

51:36.460 --> 51:38.498
It was her or us.

51:44.451 --> 51:44.852
Good.

53:15.001 --> 53:16.959
That wound can't
be cauterize again.

53:19.796 --> 53:21.914
You need to get to a hospital
before it's too late.

53:26.669 --> 53:27.668
This will be over soon.

53:38.857 --> 53:40.616
Is that the first
time you shot someone?

53:50.486 --> 53:52.963
I haven't fired a weapon
since the Gulf War of '91.

54:00.076 --> 54:02.162
I didn't know a
military padre would

54:02.193 --> 54:06.478
have to open fire on anyone.

54:06.510 --> 54:12.711
You take an oath when
it comes down to it,

54:12.743 --> 54:16.140
you're soldier
first, priest second.

54:19.616 --> 54:19.976
Right.

54:26.210 --> 54:30.653
I was on patrol with my
unit, we were attacked

54:30.685 --> 54:33.882
by a bunch of insurgents.

54:37.079 --> 54:38.637
I did what I had to do.

54:44.831 --> 54:54.470
Tonight, all of this
has taken me right back there.

54:54.502 --> 54:59.536
Tonight, all of this
has taken me right back there.

55:04.651 --> 55:06.210
I had no idea you had
been through that.

55:09.487 --> 55:10.086
Why would you?

55:15.040 --> 55:18.005
I'm familiar with this church.

55:18.037 --> 55:19.636
I've seen you around.

55:22.154 --> 55:23.921
It's never occurred
to me that you would

55:23.952 --> 55:25.031
have been in the military.

55:27.748 --> 55:29.226
What makes a priest
do that anyway?

55:33.103 --> 55:37.986
For most, it's a
personal need to serve

55:38.018 --> 55:39.217
with those in the front line.

55:43.053 --> 55:44.252
But it was different for you.

55:49.727 --> 55:52.004
You and I may have more
in common than you think.

55:59.676 --> 56:00.635
Pass me my cell.

56:04.910 --> 56:06.509
I just want to
show you something.

56:38.837 --> 56:43.792
I have a son who I spent
many years running away from.

56:47.148 --> 56:50.025
just as you have running away
from your daughter, Madison.

56:53.582 --> 56:59.017
I didn't think you were allowed
to have kids in the priesthood.

57:03.013 --> 57:07.057
Jude was conceived when I
was a very young man before I

57:07.089 --> 57:09.934
joined the priesthood.

57:09.966 --> 57:15.160
But I wasn't man enough to
face up to my responsibilities.

57:20.355 --> 57:22.321
I was weak.

57:22.353 --> 57:25.798
It was lust.

57:25.830 --> 57:29.194
Find me a kid who's
not led by his dick.

57:29.226 --> 57:33.391
I was supposed to be different.

57:33.422 --> 57:35.429
When other boys were
getting up to mischief,

57:35.460 --> 57:40.655
I was watching the news, reading
the papers, going to church.

57:44.012 --> 57:49.215
All they ever wanted was
to be helpful to people.

57:49.246 --> 57:51.445
Be a good Christian,
become a priest.

57:54.041 --> 57:59.764
We all make mistakes,
it's how we overcome them.

57:59.796 --> 58:05.238
My dad knew about
the birth of Jude.

58:05.270 --> 58:09.235
He asked me a very
simple question,

58:09.266 --> 58:14.749
what's more important to you,
being a father to this boy

58:14.781 --> 58:15.740
or becoming a priest?

58:19.456 --> 58:26.378
I'd always wanted to be a
priest, it was my calling.

58:26.409 --> 58:31.884
So I chose that over my own son.

58:37.439 --> 58:45.877
I held him in my arms,
perfect little baby,

58:45.909 --> 58:46.829
just that one time.

58:50.385 --> 58:52.903
That was the day I knew I
was leaving town for good.

58:58.897 --> 59:01.183
Where'd you go?

59:01.214 --> 59:05.098
I went to a seminary out
West, got back to my studies,

59:05.130 --> 59:07.329
eventually became a priest
and joined the Marines.

59:09.925 --> 59:13.051
What happened to them?

59:13.083 --> 59:18.285
I received news that his
mother died about 10 years ago.

59:18.317 --> 59:20.244
What about Jude?

59:20.275 --> 59:21.234
You know where he is now?

59:25.110 --> 59:28.795
The last time I saw
him was in that photo.

59:28.826 --> 59:35.788
I just got back from Iraq,
that war really got to me.

59:35.819 --> 59:48.536
Made me realize I needed to face
my son, beg his forgiveness,

59:48.567 --> 59:54.969
and tell them that if I could
make things different, I would.

59:55.001 --> 59:55.960
How'd that work out?

59:59.596 --> 1:00:07.036
He agreed to see me a few times,
listen to what I had to say,

1:00:07.068 --> 1:00:11.912
and it seemed like we
could maybe salvage

1:00:11.944 --> 1:00:15.380
some kind of a relationship.

1:00:18.377 --> 1:00:23.532
He was a very strong-minded
young man, but cold.

1:00:28.207 --> 1:00:31.172
No emotions.

1:00:31.204 --> 1:00:34.410
I guess I could hardly
expect a tearful reunion,

1:00:34.441 --> 1:00:43.880
but still, it seemed like
he had no feelings about it

1:00:43.912 --> 1:00:44.871
or about me.

1:00:49.146 --> 1:00:53.870
Oh, a good father
nurtures his child.

1:00:53.902 --> 1:00:59.505
He loves, shows him the way.

1:00:59.536 --> 1:01:00.455
I did none of that.

1:01:04.172 --> 1:01:08.008
He told me he wanted
nothing to do with me.

1:01:10.604 --> 1:01:19.365
So I had to agree to
abide by his wishes

1:01:19.396 --> 1:01:22.162
You know where he is now?

1:01:22.194 --> 1:01:23.552
I don't even know if he's alive.

1:01:29.426 --> 1:01:33.710
Don't make the same
mistake I made.

1:01:33.742 --> 1:01:35.668
Reach out to your
daughter, Madison,

1:01:35.700 --> 1:01:41.062
now before you never
get the chance to again.

1:01:41.094 --> 1:01:43.851
I buried my feelings
for Jude for many years.

1:01:46.250 --> 1:01:50.934
It took a war to shake
me back to reality,

1:01:50.965 --> 1:01:54.401
resurrect my feelings
for him and face him.

1:01:59.476 --> 1:02:00.875
What did it take for you?

1:02:03.632 --> 1:02:05.269
I never turned my
back on Maddie.

1:02:07.827 --> 1:02:10.553
But you haven't
seen her in years.

1:02:10.585 --> 1:02:13.351
So what?

1:02:13.382 --> 1:02:17.546
It's not a day goes by
that she's not on my mind.

1:02:17.578 --> 1:02:22.461
If you're going to truly
repent, admit to everything

1:02:22.493 --> 1:02:24.898
you've done.

1:02:24.930 --> 1:02:27.409
The first thing you've got to
do is be honest with yourself.

1:02:30.964 --> 1:02:35.608
I've been deep cover
for so long, Father.

1:02:35.640 --> 1:02:36.399
So damn long.

1:02:39.116 --> 1:02:40.355
Yes, but what?

1:02:46.428 --> 1:02:53.102
I only wanted one thing,
to revenge Jesse's murder.

1:02:56.180 --> 1:03:01.215
And to do that, I had to be
Victor Strong, the gangster.

1:03:04.691 --> 1:03:11.044
Whenever I thought about
Maddie, it got harder.

1:03:14.241 --> 1:03:20.595
So like you, I locked it away.

1:03:25.469 --> 1:03:27.037
It's OK.

1:03:27.068 --> 1:03:31.104
You must look inside yourself,
bring this out, face her.

1:03:36.059 --> 1:03:42.541
I liked being the outlaw,
I liked the escape.

1:03:42.573 --> 1:03:48.255
I felt no pain, no
guilt, until the man

1:03:48.287 --> 1:03:50.524
I was before had
completely disappeared.

1:03:54.400 --> 1:04:00.483
And then one day I drove
past Jessie's grave

1:04:00.515 --> 1:04:06.957
and I went to see her,
and I found myself

1:04:06.989 --> 1:04:09.035
talking to God for the
first time in as long

1:04:09.067 --> 1:04:09.625
as I can remember.

1:04:20.655 --> 1:04:26.649
We have different wounds,
Victor, but the same scars.

1:04:55.460 --> 1:04:56.060
What's that?

1:04:58.817 --> 1:05:03.220
It's me facing Madison,
it's my confession.

1:05:03.252 --> 1:05:04.099
For what?

1:05:04.131 --> 1:05:06.817
For everything.

1:05:06.849 --> 1:05:10.493
Why I did what I did.

1:05:10.525 --> 1:05:16.407
It'll hurt her, but
it'll set her free too.

1:05:16.439 --> 1:05:20.563
Did you do some of the
things Willow said you did?

1:05:20.594 --> 1:05:23.400
Yeah.

1:05:23.431 --> 1:05:26.557
I was deep cover.

1:05:26.589 --> 1:05:30.992
I was working a special
deniable operation

1:05:31.024 --> 1:05:35.708
that only four people,
including me, knew about.

1:05:35.740 --> 1:05:41.542
Well, why can't we call them,
ask them to get you out,

1:05:41.573 --> 1:05:44.299
get you reunited with Madison?

1:05:44.331 --> 1:05:49.286
To of 'em are dead, and
the other one is dirty.

1:05:52.483 --> 1:05:55.199
This letter details
the entire thing.

1:05:57.877 --> 1:05:59.763
How I was kicked out of
the police department

1:05:59.795 --> 1:06:02.521
was all a cover story.

1:06:02.552 --> 1:06:04.799
I was sent to prison
on bogus charges

1:06:04.831 --> 1:06:08.187
to get on the inside as one
of them, it was the only way.

1:06:11.184 --> 1:06:15.509
Maddie needs to know why I
left her, why I did what I did.

1:06:15.540 --> 1:06:17.666
She deserves to
know all of this.

1:06:17.698 --> 1:06:20.783
And then once she
does, she needs

1:06:20.814 --> 1:06:23.780
to reveal it to the world.

1:06:23.811 --> 1:06:27.296
Why can't you do this together?

1:06:27.327 --> 1:06:28.127
Look at me, Father.

1:06:31.403 --> 1:06:34.529
I'm going to be dead soon.

1:06:34.561 --> 1:06:37.406
I can call you a doctor.

1:06:37.438 --> 1:06:39.684
I don't think you're hearing me.

1:06:39.715 --> 1:06:41.841
There was evidence
in this letter

1:06:41.873 --> 1:06:46.318
that one of the leading cops of
the Massachusetts State Police

1:06:46.349 --> 1:06:51.631
is not only dirty, he is running
the entire criminal network

1:06:51.663 --> 1:06:53.262
that I have been infiltrating.

1:06:56.299 --> 1:06:58.385
Get to someone higher.

1:06:58.416 --> 1:07:03.660
Someone who can get
you somewhere safe

1:07:03.691 --> 1:07:05.977
and get the truth out.

1:07:06.009 --> 1:07:08.894
This bastard's rage
spreads far and wide.

1:07:08.925 --> 1:07:11.452
He has a hell of a lot
of people working for him

1:07:11.483 --> 1:07:13.530
who are ready to bury me.

1:07:13.562 --> 1:07:16.638
We have to get this to Madison
so she can seek justice.

1:07:21.834 --> 1:07:27.756
Look, if I stand beside you,
the police will listen to me.

1:07:27.787 --> 1:07:31.752
You don't have to do this,
you don't have to die here.

1:07:31.783 --> 1:07:33.390
Do you really think
Willow was going

1:07:33.422 --> 1:07:36.746
to let you walk out of here?

1:07:36.778 --> 1:07:39.744
This corrupt cop is the
only other person alive

1:07:39.776 --> 1:07:43.380
who knows about my operation.

1:07:43.412 --> 1:07:45.298
There is evidence
in here linking him

1:07:45.330 --> 1:07:47.696
to the entire thing.

1:07:47.728 --> 1:07:52.252
I have been playing him
and he now knows that.

1:07:52.283 --> 1:07:55.759
We have to get this truth
out there so we can stop him.

1:07:58.596 --> 1:08:02.360
There's a lawyer
I know who handles

1:08:02.392 --> 1:08:04.199
cases against the state.

1:08:04.231 --> 1:08:07.636
We can call him, he can take
you in, get you a safe route.

1:08:07.667 --> 1:08:13.470
This thing is too damn
big I wouldn't survive,

1:08:13.502 --> 1:08:15.508
just like Jesse didn't.

1:08:15.540 --> 1:08:17.865
Jesse?

1:08:17.897 --> 1:08:19.815
What in hell does this
got you do with Jesse?

1:08:22.493 --> 1:08:25.250
This corrupt son of a bitch
is who murdered my wife.

1:08:39.595 --> 1:08:42.800
I told you Jesse
was ambitious, I

1:08:42.832 --> 1:08:45.798
told you she was a high flyer.

1:08:45.830 --> 1:08:48.514
It's all true.

1:08:48.546 --> 1:08:52.071
She was like that from
the first day I met her.

1:08:52.103 --> 1:08:54.709
How did you meet her?

1:08:54.741 --> 1:08:57.347
We met at the Police Academy.

1:08:57.378 --> 1:08:59.983
She's a cop too?

1:09:00.015 --> 1:09:01.533
I went PD she went state.

1:09:04.849 --> 1:09:08.574
She spent her entire time
working a drug cartel,

1:09:08.606 --> 1:09:12.731
dealing with intelligence
and organizing covered ops.

1:09:12.762 --> 1:09:16.519
She built a massive case
against this same dirty cop.

1:09:20.594 --> 1:09:24.718
After she died, I should
have turned my attention

1:09:24.750 --> 1:09:31.632
to Maddie, been the dad
that she wanted me to be.

1:09:31.663 --> 1:09:35.148
But I knew this wasn't some
bullshit robbery gone wrong,

1:09:35.179 --> 1:09:37.618
I knew that the truth
had been covered up.

1:09:40.974 --> 1:09:46.529
So I got myself recruited
to state to get my revenge.

1:09:50.485 --> 1:09:54.489
I made the decision to do
this, even though it cost

1:09:54.520 --> 1:09:55.678
my relationship with Maddie.

1:09:59.955 --> 1:10:03.600
I told my mother to take her
somewhere safe, somewhere

1:10:03.631 --> 1:10:08.035
that even I didn't know,
so there was no way my work

1:10:08.066 --> 1:10:09.226
leading to where she was.

1:10:21.733 --> 1:10:26.497
I now have all of this
to bring him down,

1:10:26.529 --> 1:10:29.853
to finally finish this.

1:10:29.885 --> 1:10:34.808
But how can you protect
her if you're already dead?

1:10:34.840 --> 1:10:40.594
You can't protect me, brother,
but you can't protect her.

1:10:44.590 --> 1:10:46.637
How?

1:10:46.668 --> 1:10:48.794
Why me?

1:10:48.826 --> 1:10:53.150
You have to get this
confession to Maddie.

1:10:53.182 --> 1:10:55.627
Put her somewhere safe within
the church organization,

1:10:55.659 --> 1:10:58.864
hide her, speak
to that lawyer you

1:10:58.896 --> 1:11:04.419
can trust, get this truth out
there and set my daughter free.

1:11:04.450 --> 1:11:06.089
What makes you think
I could do all this?

1:11:09.006 --> 1:11:12.051
I'm not here by chance, Father.

1:11:12.083 --> 1:11:13.729
What do you mean?

1:11:13.761 --> 1:11:16.846
I chose to come here tonight.

1:11:16.878 --> 1:11:19.963
I chose you to do this.

1:11:19.994 --> 1:11:22.002
How did you choose me?

1:11:22.033 --> 1:11:22.632
Why?

1:11:25.949 --> 1:11:28.715
I already knew we had
something in common.

1:11:28.746 --> 1:11:29.106
What?

1:11:33.901 --> 1:11:34.501
Jude.

1:11:41.214 --> 1:11:43.620
You know Jude?

1:11:43.651 --> 1:11:47.615
You know where he is?

1:11:47.647 --> 1:11:48.934
Yeah.

1:11:48.966 --> 1:11:50.653
But how?

1:11:50.685 --> 1:11:53.210
No one does.

1:11:53.242 --> 1:11:56.758
Jude made it so no one
could find him or trace him.

1:12:02.912 --> 1:12:03.631
Is he alive?

1:12:06.508 --> 1:12:08.875
Yes.

1:12:08.906 --> 1:12:12.271
Oh, my God,

1:12:12.303 --> 1:12:13.901
I wouldn't celebrate just yet.

1:12:16.739 --> 1:12:18.096
It was Jude that murdered Jesse.

1:12:26.688 --> 1:12:33.210
No, no, no, you must
have the wrong person.

1:12:33.242 --> 1:12:34.848
No.

1:12:34.880 --> 1:12:36.958
He now runs the
entire damn thing.

1:12:42.672 --> 1:12:46.916
You need to get this to
my girl and stop him.

1:12:46.948 --> 1:12:48.267
Nobody's stopping anybody.

1:12:52.422 --> 1:12:52.942
Maddie?

1:12:57.018 --> 1:13:01.302
Jude, I don't believe it.

1:13:01.333 --> 1:13:02.133
Put your gun down.

1:13:05.369 --> 1:13:07.136
Let her go.

1:13:07.167 --> 1:13:10.653
No, please, please,
don't do this.

1:13:10.684 --> 1:13:11.643
Shut up, old man.

1:13:19.875 --> 1:13:22.920
Look at me, Maddie.

1:13:22.952 --> 1:13:25.677
It's OK.

1:13:25.709 --> 1:13:28.834
You just block it out.

1:13:28.866 --> 1:13:30.752
Everything's going to be OK.

1:13:30.784 --> 1:13:34.029
You want to watch your daughter
die like you did your wife?

1:13:34.061 --> 1:13:34.748
Fuck you.

1:13:34.780 --> 1:13:35.380
Let go of me.

1:13:38.217 --> 1:13:40.622
Dad, what's happening?

1:13:40.654 --> 1:13:42.301
You were supposed to
be somewhere safe where

1:13:42.333 --> 1:13:44.179
no one could find you.

1:13:44.210 --> 1:13:46.976
Why am I involved in this?

1:13:47.008 --> 1:13:51.132
Everything you need to
know is in here, baby.

1:13:51.163 --> 1:13:54.329
Not like you're ever
going to get to read it.

1:13:54.360 --> 1:13:55.240
Last fucking chance.

1:14:00.394 --> 1:14:01.953
I swear to God I will shoot you.

1:14:09.705 --> 1:14:10.704
Put your gun down, Victor.

1:14:15.779 --> 1:14:16.666
What are you doing?

1:14:16.698 --> 1:14:18.145
You're a priest.

1:14:18.176 --> 1:14:19.815
I'm sorry, he's my son.

1:14:23.052 --> 1:14:23.811
He's a murderer.

1:14:44.271 --> 1:14:47.915
Put the fucking gun down!
