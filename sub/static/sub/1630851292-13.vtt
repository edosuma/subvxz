Dinnertime, everyone.

00:36.428 --> 00:38.370
You know what I'm craving?
Lobster.

00:38.597 --> 00:41.265
Your lobster today
is Dinty Moore stew

00:41.433 --> 00:43.691
from a can too dented
to risk on people.

00:43.786 --> 00:47.028
What does "Dinty" even mean?
Is it an adjective or a guy?

00:47.197 --> 00:48.622
Or a contraction, like,

00:48.774 --> 00:51.199
"Boy, he really screwed up
that meal, din't he?"

00:51.218 --> 00:55.036
I mean, Dinty Moore?
How about Dinty Less, right?

00:55.130 --> 00:57.598
Gold. All of this.

00:58.392 --> 00:59.449
(doorbell rings)

00:59.468 --> 01:01.042
I'll get it.
It might be Jabberjaw.

01:01.136 --> 01:02.969
Uh, you kids don't
remember<i> Jabberjaw,</i>

01:03.122 --> 01:06.231
but your father very badly
wants to meet Jabberjaw.

01:06.458 --> 01:08.308
It came! My hammock came!

01:08.460 --> 01:11.962
Yay, you brought loud energy
into the dining room!

01:11.980 --> 01:13.630
Why did you get
a hammock, Peter?

01:13.649 --> 01:15.632
Well, the year 2020
was a terrible year

01:15.651 --> 01:17.725
for the Corona beer company,
so they had to sell off

01:17.745 --> 01:19.469
all their TV commercial
hammocks.

01:19.563 --> 01:21.580
And owning a hammock from TV
has always been

01:21.807 --> 01:23.231
my third-biggest dream.

01:23.325 --> 01:25.158
-My first big...
-Meet Jabberjaw.

01:25.311 --> 01:26.643
Okay, you know about Jabberjaw.

01:26.662 --> 01:30.480
And then my other dream
is to be an NFL referee.

01:30.499 --> 01:31.590
(football thuds)

01:34.153 --> 01:37.012
It's good, it's good.
The-the-the kick was good.

01:41.994 --> 01:44.103
Hammock life is the best life,
Chris.

01:44.254 --> 01:46.847
Yeah, you clearly wanted
to be seen lying in a hammock,

01:46.941 --> 01:49.333
so I'm glad
I could do that for you.

01:49.426 --> 01:52.018
Now, to drink lemonade
with a southern drawl.

01:52.113 --> 01:55.005
(English accent): Chip, chip,
guv'nor. Shrimp on the barbie.

01:55.023 --> 01:58.675
(chuckles)
You sound like Colonel Sanders.

01:58.768 --> 02:00.619
(shouts)

02:00.846 --> 02:02.437
-(regular voice): Damn it.
-Oh, no.

02:02.531 --> 02:05.349
The neighbor's sprinkler
ruined whatever this is.

02:05.442 --> 02:07.851
Not so fast, Chris.
I don't give up that easy.

02:07.870 --> 02:09.019
Good for you, Dad.

02:09.112 --> 02:10.354
Go knock on the neighbor's door

02:10.447 --> 02:12.706
and have a mildly
uncomfortable conversation.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.258
I give up.

02:23.051 --> 02:25.627
Peter, uh, we can't start
until you start.

02:25.721 --> 02:28.889
I'm sorry, gang, I'm just so mad
at my backyard neighbor.

02:29.041 --> 02:30.315
-What's the problem?
-He's got a sprinkler

02:30.542 --> 02:32.709
going nuts and spraying
on my property.

02:32.802 --> 02:35.212
-I just don't know what to do.
-(soft music playing)

02:35.230 --> 02:37.230
<i> Hang on while I close</i>
<i> this law book</i>

02:37.324 --> 02:39.641

03:08.096 --> 03:10.171
<i> I said I wasn't wearing that!</i>

03:10.265 --> 03:11.581
Maybe you should
hire that lawyer

03:11.600 --> 03:13.675
to sue the problem neighbor
you got.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.770
Hey, great idea, Cleveland.
I loved his little judge hammer.

03:16.922 --> 03:18.438
Gavel, it's called.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.532
<i> N-N-N-N-N-Now, because this</i>
<i> is a regional commercial,</i>

03:20.609 --> 03:22.776

03:22.928 --> 03:24.778
<i> But remember, call 22...</i>

03:24.872 --> 03:27.039
(theme music playing)

03:31.027 --> 03:33.194
Mr. Griffin,
I've reviewed your complaint,

03:33.214 --> 03:35.029
and I think you have
an excellent case.

03:35.049 --> 03:38.475
-That's great.
-N-N-N-N-N-Now, can I tell you
something off the record?

03:38.477 --> 03:40.702
<i> "Live At Birdland,</i>
Art Blakey Quartet,

03:40.721 --> 03:42.629
Blue Note Records, 1957."

03:42.781 --> 03:45.057
Okay, I can see that I came
to the right lawyer.

03:45.133 --> 03:48.060
N-N-N-Now, I just need
to file a brief.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.047
Yeah, this-this is gonna
work out. I want to hire you.

03:53.141 --> 03:55.567
Excellent. Let me just
type up your filing.

03:55.719 --> 03:57.143
Name: Peter Griffin.

03:57.312 --> 03:59.738
Favorite WNBA Team--
that's a weird second question.

03:59.889 --> 04:01.073
I'll put "Dallas Wings."

04:01.224 --> 04:02.632
Home address...

04:02.726 --> 04:04.892
Wait, you live
at 31 Spooner Street?

04:04.912 --> 04:06.894
Yeah, cross street: Forker Lane.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.639
Out in Cutlery Estates.
Is that a problem?

04:09.658 --> 04:12.142
Um, nope. No problem.

04:12.160 --> 04:14.068
I got you, Peter Griffin.

04:14.162 --> 04:16.255
When we goes to court,
I will be right there with you.

04:16.331 --> 04:18.315
Just like I say
on my local cable commercial,

04:18.333 --> 04:20.575
"With Brick by your side,
you can't..."

04:20.594 --> 04:22.594
(theme music playing)

04:27.659 --> 04:30.010
Thanks for helping me find
a lobster roll truck

04:30.104 --> 04:31.270
on Instagram, Stewie.

04:31.421 --> 04:32.829
Eh, I just wish
we didn't have to go

04:32.922 --> 04:35.181
to this stupid,
gentrified waterfront.

04:35.334 --> 04:36.775
This place was so much better

04:36.926 --> 04:38.777
when it sucked
and we never came here.

04:38.928 --> 04:40.837
Well, here's our
lobster roll truck.

04:40.839 --> 04:43.448
HIPSTER:
Uh, hey, guys?

04:43.600 --> 04:45.008
You're cutting in line.

04:45.027 --> 04:49.270
It starts back there.

04:49.290 --> 04:50.438
What? No.

04:50.532 --> 04:52.624
All I wanted was just
some decent lobster.

04:52.776 --> 04:55.201
You know, Bri, they're right
out there, up for grabs.

04:55.354 --> 04:57.129
We should just go
straight to the source.

04:57.356 --> 04:59.113
What are you even suggesting,
Stewie?

04:59.207 --> 05:02.426
That we, what, we get a lobster
boat and be lobstermen?

05:04.530 --> 05:06.054
Yeah.

05:11.628 --> 05:14.721
Hey, Peter, where's the
defendant? And where's Brick?

05:14.798 --> 05:17.131
Sorry I'm late. I had to make
these small desserts

05:17.151 --> 05:18.650
change their ways.

05:18.802 --> 05:20.301
Ha. Tort reform.

05:20.321 --> 05:22.821
Anyway, let's get this started.

05:23.048 --> 05:24.656
Wha-- Why are you
standing there?

05:24.808 --> 05:26.825
You're supposed to be over here,
suing my neighbor.

05:26.976 --> 05:30.144
Uh, Peter, I am your neighbor.

05:30.164 --> 05:32.238
(gasps)
You're my neighbor?

05:32.391 --> 05:33.406
You're the defendant?

05:33.500 --> 05:36.168
And I'm the courtroom
sketch artist?

05:38.246 --> 05:39.671
I drew a<i> Far Side.</i>

05:46.905 --> 05:48.405
I hire you to sue my neighbor,

05:48.498 --> 05:50.164
and you don't tell me
you're my neighbor?

05:50.184 --> 05:51.850
-That's so unethical.
-Whoa.

05:52.001 --> 05:53.593
I may not have gone
to Harvard Law School,

05:53.687 --> 05:55.002
and I don't even know
if you keep track

05:55.022 --> 05:56.429
of who went to Harvard
Law School...

05:56.523 --> 05:58.523
-I don't.
-...but I did not go
to Harvard Law School

05:58.675 --> 06:01.008
just to have my integrity
questioned.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.694
But you said you'd be my lawyer.

06:02.771 --> 06:04.270
Did I, Peter? Think back.

06:04.423 --> 06:06.239
I really want you to think back
really quickly.

06:07.368 --> 06:11.111
Peter, we could've had fun,
but I died.

06:11.263 --> 06:14.039
Yeesh. I-I don't want
to think anymore for a while.

06:14.266 --> 06:16.357
Gentlemen, the jury's waiting.

06:16.377 --> 06:17.934
Your Honor,
you got to understand,

06:17.953 --> 06:19.452
I thought I had a lawyer,
but now...

06:19.605 --> 06:21.713
Very well.
I'll grant a continuance

06:21.865 --> 06:25.759
and just enter into the court
record that you're a chicken.

06:26.795 --> 06:28.111
Wait, what?

06:28.130 --> 06:29.721
It's perfectly routine.

06:29.948 --> 06:31.615
I just note that Peter Griffin

06:31.708 --> 06:35.118
has to run and hide
behind his lawyer daddy.

06:35.137 --> 06:37.062
What-- n-no.
I don't need a lawyer.

06:37.289 --> 06:39.398
I'm gonna beat Brick Baker
all on my own.

06:39.549 --> 06:41.124
But I don't got
an opening statement.

06:41.143 --> 06:45.112
Ooh. I move
for a five-minute recess.

06:45.906 --> 06:49.241
(laughs)

06:49.468 --> 06:51.559
-I'm worried for Peter.
-I'll say.

06:51.578 --> 06:52.969
Brick Baker's gonna win, easy.

06:53.062 --> 06:55.155
Look, he's leaned back
with his feet up,

06:55.307 --> 06:57.565
confidently whistling.

06:57.584 --> 06:59.643
(exhaling sharply)

06:59.661 --> 07:01.811
He's, uh, he's not very good
at whistling,

07:01.905 --> 07:04.047
but he's doing the other stuff.

07:08.503 --> 07:10.411
I can't believe
we're doing this.

07:10.431 --> 07:12.413
We're actually going
lobster fishing.

07:12.507 --> 07:14.824
Our way of life
is disappearing, Bri.

07:14.843 --> 07:17.418
Stewie, we got the boat
20 minutes ago. Settle down.

07:17.438 --> 07:18.920
How'd we get the boat, anyway?

07:18.939 --> 07:21.998
Traded it for opioids from
a working-class New Englander

07:22.017 --> 07:24.091
-hooked on opioids.
-Huh.

07:24.186 --> 07:26.260
All right, well, I got
lobster pots, trammel nets,

07:26.280 --> 07:29.764
buoys, chum, rope,
flotation gear and a radio.

07:29.858 --> 07:31.357
-What do you got?
-Opioids.

07:31.510 --> 07:33.601
Stewie, stop screwing around
and give me those opioids

07:33.695 --> 07:34.844
and go get me some more opioids.

07:34.938 --> 07:36.362
Uh, let me check
on Rupert first.

07:36.515 --> 07:38.957
Rupert, how you doing
with that double sheet bend?

07:40.352 --> 07:42.794
Okay, apparently I said
"half hitch" or whatever.

07:42.946 --> 07:45.205
-I don't even know
why you brought him.
-Let's not talk about it.

07:45.299 --> 07:47.299
He gets so jealous
when you and I hang out.

07:47.450 --> 07:49.375
Well, tell him he doesn't
have anything to worry about.

07:49.528 --> 07:51.261
He doesn't?

07:54.199 --> 07:57.367
Mr. Griffin, this has been
a huge waste of time.

07:57.460 --> 08:00.220
I hereby find for the defendant,
effective as of the moment

08:00.314 --> 08:02.296
I slam down
my gavel uninterrup...

08:02.390 --> 08:05.967
Wait! Your Honor, we have
evidence relevant to this case.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.394
Who are you?
And what kind of evidence?

08:08.547 --> 08:11.047
I'm an HOA dick,
and I found bylaws proving

08:11.140 --> 08:14.141
that Brick used his sprinklers
on incorrect Tuesdays.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.569
I'm a cop, and I'm gonna
suspiciously turn off

08:16.663 --> 08:20.056
my body cam, in case
something sketchy goes down.

08:20.075 --> 08:22.334
And I found Quahog's original
survey maps,

08:22.485 --> 08:26.171
proving that Brick's sprinklers
aren't even on his own property.

08:26.322 --> 08:28.173
What?

08:29.417 --> 08:32.010
The town surveyor
was being pestered by a bee,

08:32.161 --> 08:34.921
so the property lines
were all twisty-turny.

08:35.073 --> 08:37.641
Oh, that's why
his statue's like that.

08:41.263 --> 08:44.597
Well, this is more than enough
evidence for cartoon court.

08:44.750 --> 08:46.933
I find for the plaintiff.

08:47.085 --> 08:48.175
-Yeah!
-We did it!

08:48.195 --> 08:50.654
Talk about "all rise." Giggity!

08:52.015 --> 08:53.865
G-G-I-T-Y.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.350
Yeah, there's-there's no Ds
in "giggity."

08:56.444 --> 08:58.411
(birds chirping)

09:03.101 --> 09:05.359
Three hours of lobster fishing
and nothing.

09:05.528 --> 09:07.604
You shouldn't have dumped
all my Percocets in the water.

09:07.622 --> 09:09.363
Now the lobsters are just down
there hanging out

09:09.532 --> 09:12.275
and defrauding the government
for disability checks.

09:12.294 --> 09:13.777
Should we drop our traps
somewhere else?

09:13.795 --> 09:16.370
-Like where?
-I don't know,
maybe we try David Harbour.

09:16.390 --> 09:19.057
It's that harbor nobody even
heard of until three years ago,

09:19.208 --> 09:20.374
and now all of a sudden
it's huge.

09:20.394 --> 09:21.968
Eh, we could try Michael Bay.

09:22.120 --> 09:24.396
Although I hear that bay
was mean to Megan Fox.

09:24.547 --> 09:25.713
Maybe Roger Waters?

09:25.732 --> 09:27.140
-George Strait?
-Billy Ocean?

09:27.234 --> 09:28.474
-Ricki Lake?
-River Phoenix?

09:28.569 --> 09:31.461
How are those celebrity
water puns working out?

09:31.479 --> 09:34.239
-Welp, this has been a bust.
-Sea Thomas Howell?

09:34.390 --> 09:36.316
Anyway,
your guys' were good, too.

09:36.468 --> 09:39.393
Uhp, we're due
for an eight-second squall.

09:39.487 --> 09:40.987

10:19.344 --> 10:21.361

-What?

10:21.455 --> 10:23.179
We've been together
a long time, Brian.

10:23.181 --> 10:25.498
We have to do things
to keep it fresh.

10:29.463 --> 10:31.129

10:31.280 --> 10:33.114
Hey, brother. Wakanda forever.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.875

10:35.952 --> 10:37.284

10:39.030 --> 10:41.288

You been talking to Lois?

10:41.308 --> 10:43.141

from the right spot.

10:43.368 --> 10:44.868

10:44.886 --> 10:46.478
You have been talking to Lois.

10:46.629 --> 10:48.295
Listen, the moral
of the story is this:

10:48.357 --> 10:50.982
watching you all in the court
today, I realized something.

10:51.209 --> 10:53.209
I may have a fancy law degree
and a phone number

10:53.302 --> 10:54.319

10:54.470 --> 10:56.529
...but, Peter, you have friends.

10:56.657 --> 10:59.974
And no one can ever take them
away from you.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.976
He said that weird.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.144
