WEBVTT

00:07.600 --> 00:11.130
Oh, God, I can't deal 
with any more kids poking at me.

00:11.200 --> 00:14.500
At least you get the kids. 
I get their dads.

00:14.560 --> 00:16.430
Letches all want me 
to sit on their laps.

00:16.500 --> 00:19.260
I don't much care for the way Santa 
is gawking at you either.

00:19.330 --> 00:21.230
Don't do that.

00:21.300 --> 00:22.830
You're too pretty to smoke.

00:22.900 --> 00:25.200
Next you're going to tell me 
it'll stunt my growth.

00:25.260 --> 00:26.660
Be nice now, it's Christmas.

00:28.100 --> 00:29.160
What's that smell?

00:29.230 --> 00:30.230
What do you want?

00:30.300 --> 00:31.900
It's the back of a mall.

00:31.960 --> 00:34.200
I have a very sensitive nose.

00:34.260 --> 00:36.660
Don't walk. Why are you walking?

00:36.730 --> 00:38.760
- Let's just sit. 
- It's coming from over here.

00:38.830 --> 00:40.400
There's something.

00:40.460 --> 00:43.630
Probably old hot dogs or a dead cat.

00:43.700 --> 00:45.530
No, no, no, don't touch.

00:45.600 --> 00:46.860
Let me.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.074

01:00.130 --> 01:02.430
Jail's not too bad.

01:02.500 --> 01:03.830
I get meals with your brother.

01:03.900 --> 01:05.960
We go out on these work details together.

01:06.030 --> 01:09.300
You haven't asked me why 
I'm strapped in these chains.

01:09.360 --> 01:10.830
Well, you're in jail.

01:10.900 --> 01:14.030
No, I'm in dress rehearsal 
for A Christmas Carol.

01:14.100 --> 01:15.930
You're Jacob Marley?

01:16.000 --> 01:18.100
I wanted to be Scrooge, 
but some triple homicide

01:18.160 --> 01:20.060
in Cell Block H got the part.

01:20.130 --> 01:21.500
You don't want to know how.

01:23.360 --> 01:24.760
What are you going to 
do for Christmas?

01:24.830 --> 01:25.930
I'm doing what I always do.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.260
I'm going on a trip.

01:27.330 --> 01:29.030
To New York?

01:29.100 --> 01:31.030
Peru. National Geographic found

01:31.100 --> 01:32.430
a new step pyramid

01:32.500 --> 01:34.900
at an ancient ceremonial 
site known as El Brujo.

01:34.960 --> 01:37.600
1,500-year-old skeletons.

01:37.660 --> 01:40.330
Part of a very mysterious 
culture called the Moche.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.560
Well, unless they're elves, 
it's not very Christmassy.

01:42.630 --> 01:44.100
No, they aren't elves.

01:44.160 --> 01:46.600
You know what I'd like?

01:46.660 --> 01:50.100
I'd like to spend another 
Christmas with kids...

01:50.160 --> 01:53.460
with a family, with a tree.

01:53.530 --> 01:55.400
You're in jail, Dad.

01:55.460 --> 01:58.030
So is Russ.

01:58.100 --> 02:00.600
- Mom's dead.  
- Yeah.

02:00.660 --> 02:04.500
And Christmas is overrated anyway.

02:04.560 --> 02:07.260
People expect it to be so 
perfect, and it never is.

02:07.330 --> 02:09.759
I'm really looking forward 
to the skeletons in El Brujo.

02:09.830 --> 02:13.130
Christmas and skeletons 
do not go together.

02:13.200 --> 02:17.060
I remember the Christmas 
you and Mom gave me the toolbox

02:17.130 --> 02:18.730
That was great.

02:18.800 --> 02:19.830
Yeah, except

02:19.900 --> 02:22.430
that the toolbox was for Russ.

02:22.500 --> 02:24.500
But you decided that it was yours,

02:24.560 --> 02:26.160
and he let you have it.

02:26.230 --> 02:28.330
He did?

02:28.400 --> 02:29.860
Yeah.

02:29.930 --> 02:32.400
I hope some day that, uh...

02:32.460 --> 02:34.630
we can all have 
Christmas together again.

02:34.700 --> 02:35.660
I doubt it, Dad.

02:35.730 --> 02:37.730
Lie to me. I can pretend.

02:37.800 --> 02:41.330
I've got to go look at a dead person.

02:41.400 --> 02:43.730
You never were any good at 
sugarcoating anything.

02:53.900 --> 02:55.760
You've got that sad little 
girl look on your face

02:55.830 --> 02:56.830
after you've been with your dad.

02:56.900 --> 02:57.900
No, I don't.

02:59.560 --> 03:02.900
He wishes we could spend 
Christmas together with Russ.

03:02.960 --> 03:04.300
Do it.

03:04.360 --> 03:05.600
They're both in jail.

03:05.660 --> 03:06.660
It's impossible.

03:06.730 --> 03:08.800
What are your plans?

03:08.860 --> 03:12.300
I'm thinking of driving the 
truck right off the bridge.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.030
I'm being melodramatic 
and self-pitying.

03:14.100 --> 03:15.400
You love Christmas.

03:15.460 --> 03:16.600
I love it, you know,

03:16.660 --> 03:18.330
when I have Parker.

03:18.400 --> 03:20.360
But, this year, he's going 
skiing in Vermont

03:20.430 --> 03:22.860
with Rebecca and 
Captain Fantastic.

03:22.930 --> 03:24.800
Who's Captain Fantastic?

03:24.860 --> 03:25.930
It's her boyfriend.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Commands a 
Coast Guard cutter.

03:28.060 --> 03:30.900
His last name isn't 
literally Fantastic, is it?

03:30.960 --> 03:33.000
Might as well be.

03:33.060 --> 03:35.460
You know they have a trailer at the jail.

03:35.530 --> 03:37.330
Mostly for conjugal visits.

03:37.400 --> 03:39.030
Captain Fantastic is in jail?

03:39.100 --> 03:40.230
No, your dad.

03:40.300 --> 03:41.960
You could give him what he 
wants for Christmas.

03:42.030 --> 03:43.600
- Pull a few strings. 
- I'm not a string puller.

03:43.660 --> 03:44.630
I've seen you pull some strings.

03:44.700 --> 03:46.900
My father is a murderer and a thief.

03:46.960 --> 03:47.930
Murderers and thieves--

03:48.000 --> 03:49.530
they get Christmas, too.

03:49.600 --> 03:51.000
In fact, it's kind of the point.

03:51.060 --> 03:52.900
Well, I have other plans.

03:52.960 --> 03:56.000
Whatever they are, skeletons 
and Christmas do not mix.

03:56.060 --> 03:59.460
That's exactly what my father said.

03:59.530 --> 04:00.700
Where are we going?

04:00.760 --> 04:02.730
Early Christmas present for you, Bones.

04:02.800 --> 04:03.960
Dead guy in the sewer.

04:07.200 --> 04:11.260
Cold enough as it is. Let's get this done.

04:11.330 --> 04:15.130
Great.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.060
Had to be Santa.

04:17.130 --> 04:19.160
You'd thinks someone who could 
squeeze up and down chimneys

04:19.230 --> 04:20.600
would find the sewer a snap.

04:20.660 --> 04:22.400
Rats got to him.

04:22.460 --> 04:24.630
Like huge bacterial count, 
unseasonably warm weather--

04:24.700 --> 04:27.060
explains why the rats 
found him so digestible.

04:27.130 --> 04:29.000
He was washed down 
through the sewer system.

04:29.060 --> 04:31.400
I mean, look at all the 
stuff that's around him.

04:31.460 --> 04:33.830
Uphill is that way.

04:33.900 --> 04:35.730
Busiest shopping district

04:35.800 --> 04:37.130
during the busiest shopping season.

04:37.200 --> 04:38.660
Maybe he worked up there.

04:38.730 --> 04:41.030
Or he was pushed out of 
a low-flying sleigh.

04:41.100 --> 04:43.500
Cynicism from you at Christmas?

04:43.560 --> 04:45.800
- What happened? 
- Nothing.

04:45.860 --> 04:47.030
Rebecca is taking Parker

04:47.100 --> 04:48.500
to Vermont for the holidays.

04:48.560 --> 04:50.160
- That sucks majorly. 
- It does suck majorly.

04:50.230 --> 04:53.260
So what do you say we just get 
back to our dead Santa here.

04:53.330 --> 04:55.330
He's not Santa, Booth.

04:55.400 --> 04:58.030
He's a dead man in a costume.

04:58.100 --> 05:00.430
Well, the beard looks real 
and he's pretty fat.

05:00.500 --> 05:01.830
Which doesn't make him Santa.

05:01.900 --> 05:03.100
Well, let's not jump to conclusions.

05:03.160 --> 05:04.260
Aw, three days

05:04.330 --> 05:07.200
before Christmas and 
somebody kills Santa.

05:41.267 --> 05:43.234
We'll send his gloves
to the FBI crime lab,

05:43.301 --> 05:45.401
see if they can get any
fingerprints from the inside.

05:45.467 --> 05:46.601
Damage here

05:46.668 --> 05:48.201
on the left side of the skull

05:48.267 --> 05:50.800
suggests a strong blow
to the left temporal bone.

05:50.867 --> 05:52.568
So Santa was
definitely murdered.

05:52.634 --> 05:54.267
Someone did not
like their present.

05:54.334 --> 05:56.034
There's copious insect
activity from the sewer.

05:56.700 --> 05:58.130
I'm intrigued that
the Santa myth

05:58.200 --> 05:59.930
survived so far
into modern times.

06:00.300 --> 06:02.260
Children, Dr. Addy,
it's for children.

06:02.330 --> 06:03.760
These duds are not
department store issue.

06:03.830 --> 06:05.260
This is real ermine.

06:05.330 --> 06:06.760
It's a hand-tailored suit.

06:06.830 --> 06:08.430
Which I'd like to get off of him

06:08.500 --> 06:10.030
after you two finish
your scraping and...

06:11.460 --> 06:15.560
Not that that isn't all
very, very important.

06:15.630 --> 06:18.160
What Santa is supposed to do
is clearly impossible.

06:18.230 --> 06:19.430
He keeps a list,

06:19.500 --> 06:21.630
checks it twice,
what's the big deal?

06:21.700 --> 06:23.730
If you take into account
all believers of the myth,

06:23.800 --> 06:25.130
factor in time zones,
rotation of the Earth,

06:25.200 --> 06:26.430
and assume Santa travels
east to west,

06:26.500 --> 06:28.330
he would have to make
approximately 822.6 visits

06:28.400 --> 06:29.460
per second to reach every child.

06:29.530 --> 06:31.160
So Santa parks his sleigh,

06:31.230 --> 06:33.000
unloads presents,
fills stockings,

06:33.060 --> 06:35.100
eats snacks, gets back
into his sleigh

06:35.160 --> 06:36.660
and is on to the next house

06:36.730 --> 06:39.160
in about one-one-thousandth
of a second?

06:39.230 --> 06:41.130
Children have to be stupid
to accept that.

06:41.200 --> 06:42.930
Okay, first of all,
children are not stupid,

06:43.000 --> 06:44.500
they're just children.

06:44.560 --> 06:46.430
Second, Santa is magic.

06:46.500 --> 06:47.600
Let's identify

06:47.660 --> 06:48.860
the victim, shall we?

06:48.930 --> 06:50.200
There's an ellipsoid aperture

06:50.260 --> 06:52.860
in the mandibular left canine

06:52.930 --> 06:54.760
and first premolar,

06:54.830 --> 06:56.330
consistent with pipe smoking.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.600
Hmm?

07:00.660 --> 07:02.460
Plus, traces of residue
on the canine...

07:02.530 --> 07:05.430
could this be clay?

07:05.500 --> 07:08.200
Santa is often portrayed
smoking a clay pipe.

07:08.260 --> 07:09.500
All right, all right,
very funny boys.

07:09.560 --> 07:10.800
Come on

07:10.860 --> 07:12.360
where's
your holiday spirit?
(bells jingling)

07:12.430 --> 07:15.230
Based on the degree of bloating
and purge fluids,

07:15.300 --> 07:16.530
I'd estimate time of death

07:16.600 --> 07:18.630
between 72 and
96 hours ago.

07:18.700 --> 07:21.130
Check the sewer sludge and bugs
and give me a confirmation.

07:21.200 --> 07:24.460
Phorid fly maggots,
third instar.

07:24.530 --> 07:27.800
And they appear to have
been well-fed as well.

07:27.860 --> 07:30.700
Santa was around some other
food source before he died.

07:30.760 --> 07:32.160
My bet's on
milk and cookies.

07:32.230 --> 07:35.000
This is not
Miracle on 34th Street.

07:35.060 --> 07:37.100
We're not saying this
is actually Santa Claus.

07:37.160 --> 07:38.460
We're merely anatomizing
the evidence.

07:38.530 --> 07:41.260
Okay, it's still rough,
but...

07:41.330 --> 07:44.300
this might help.

07:44.360 --> 07:46.360
Dad wants to spend

07:46.430 --> 07:47.930
Christmas with the family.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.930
So how are you going
to arrange it,

07:50.000 --> 07:51.560
bust me and Dad out?

07:51.630 --> 07:54.730
There are trailers
for conjugal visits.

07:54.800 --> 07:57.330
We might be able to
use one of those.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.030
And I talked to Amy
and she said

07:59.100 --> 08:01.030
she could bring the
girls down to see you.

08:03.200 --> 08:04.600
You shouldn't have done that.

08:04.660 --> 08:06.660
Amy said the girls
had been asking about you.

08:06.730 --> 08:08.330
I lied to them, Tempe.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.030
The girls don't even know
I'm in here.

08:10.100 --> 08:11.900
They think I went
overseas to work.

08:11.960 --> 08:13.430
You're deserting them,
just like Dad.

08:13.500 --> 08:14.900
You think it
would be better

08:14.960 --> 08:17.460
for them to find out that the
guy they think is so wonderful

08:17.530 --> 08:19.360
is actually a criminal?
When I found out Dad

08:19.430 --> 08:20.500
was not dead, I was happy,

08:20.560 --> 08:22.100
even though it turned
out that he was...

08:22.160 --> 08:23.160
A murderer?

08:26.360 --> 08:29.360
You are not a
murderer, Russ.

08:29.430 --> 08:31.930
It doesn't sound like a good
Christmas present to me.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.230
You could explain it...

08:33.299 --> 08:34.460
No, Tempe, it's not going
to happen.

08:44.530 --> 08:47.430
Can't you sleep on
your own couch?

08:47.500 --> 08:49.060
I'm just waiting

08:49.130 --> 08:50.800
for the squints
to find out something.

08:50.860 --> 08:52.100
How'd it go with Russ?

08:52.160 --> 08:54.400
He says he doesn't want
the girls to come.

08:54.460 --> 08:57.000
Your Dad-- he wants
the whole Christmas package--

08:57.060 --> 08:59.960
you know, the tree, the kids,
the presents, the whole shebang.

09:00.030 --> 09:02.330
Well, the whole shebang
is impossible.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.100
Christmas is about making
the impossible happen.

09:04.160 --> 09:05.930
You mean like you spending
Christmas with Parker.

09:06.000 --> 09:06.930
Okay, you know what,

09:07.000 --> 09:08.730
that hurt.

09:08.800 --> 09:13.030
Wake me up when the squint squad
finds out something.

09:15.730 --> 09:18.030
Victim appears to have
odd-shaped remodeling

09:18.100 --> 09:21.630
on his sacrum, with a sclerotic
margin around the injury.

09:21.700 --> 09:23.330
Some kind of
old injury?

09:23.400 --> 09:25.660
Two small indentations

09:25.730 --> 09:29.300
here, consistent
with trauma from impact

09:29.360 --> 09:31.600
with some sort of cloven-hoof?

09:31.660 --> 09:34.100
Cloven, like a reindeer?

09:34.160 --> 09:36.960
Oh, thank God
you're here.

09:37.030 --> 09:39.660
This is so wasted on me alone.

09:39.730 --> 09:42.230
Evidence is evidence
whether anyone is there
to hear it or not.

09:42.300 --> 09:45.860
Our victim was
kicked by a reindeer.

09:45.930 --> 09:47.330
Oh, get the hell out of here.

09:47.400 --> 09:48.430
The sacrum.

09:48.500 --> 09:49.930
Wait, wait.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.200
The evidence actually adds up
to an old fat man

09:54.260 --> 09:55.800
with a white beard
and a custom-made

09:55.860 --> 09:57.630
Santa suit
who smoked a clay pipe

09:57.700 --> 10:00.430
and got kicked in the
ass by a reindeer?

10:04.060 --> 10:07.560
FBI lab got partial prints
off the gloves

10:07.630 --> 10:09.830
and AFIS found a possible match.

10:09.900 --> 10:12.900
Apparently, our victim worked
for the school board.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.030
As a teacher?

10:14.100 --> 10:15.230
No.

10:15.300 --> 10:17.160
He was a Santa Claus.

10:17.230 --> 10:18.330
A Santa Claus?

10:18.400 --> 10:20.330
Or the Santa Claus?

10:20.400 --> 10:22.060
Check out his name.

10:22.130 --> 10:23.360
"Kristopher Kringle."

10:23.430 --> 10:26.360
According to AFIS,
it's his legal name.

10:26.430 --> 10:27.630
But there's the old Dutch
"Sinterklaas..."

10:27.700 --> 10:28.660
Watch out!
I'm looking.

10:28.730 --> 10:30.600
You're going to get
hit by a car.

10:30.660 --> 10:32.530
He had a partner
named Black Peter,

10:32.600 --> 10:34.960
who carried a whip
to beat naughty children.

10:35.030 --> 10:37.730
Myths are traditionally
used to control behavior.

10:37.800 --> 10:40.500
For instance, the story
of Moses bringing the
Ten Commandments...

10:40.560 --> 10:42.400
You're equating
Moses to Santa?

10:42.460 --> 10:45.260
Well, Santa is usually
considered more jolly, but...

10:45.330 --> 10:47.730
Okay, great. We're
looking for 223 Hudson.

10:47.800 --> 10:49.830
I'm sorry you can't be
with Parker, Booth.

10:49.900 --> 10:51.230
What are you going
to do, right?

10:51.300 --> 10:53.060
He's got to face
the facts sometime.

10:53.130 --> 10:55.230
She shouldn't
take him away,
not at Christmas.

10:55.300 --> 10:56.900
Not the way he
feels about you.

10:56.960 --> 10:58.860
Oh, my God.
What?

10:58.930 --> 11:01.060
He lives
in a toy store.

11:08.260 --> 11:10.430
Watch out for reindeer.

11:10.500 --> 11:12.530
Yeah. Really funny.

11:21.900 --> 11:25.360
Parker would love
this place.

11:25.430 --> 11:26.600
Look at this!

11:26.660 --> 11:28.360
Gingerbread...
he's got the train.

11:36.130 --> 11:38.060
BRENNAN:
Booth.
Yeah?

11:40.000 --> 11:42.730
This might explain
the reindeer kick
to Kringle's sacrum.

11:51.500 --> 11:55.300
Ha! You got to be kidding me.
Bones, look at this.

11:55.360 --> 11:57.700
Wow! This guy was committed.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.230
Or should've been.

12:14.730 --> 12:16.330
Hey, Bones.

12:16.400 --> 12:19.400
Check this out.

12:19.460 --> 12:21.000
Hidden compartment.

12:26.200 --> 12:29.500
Looks like this Santa was planning on buying a lot of toys

12:35.830 --> 12:37.300
Kris rented this place from me for six years.

12:37.360 --> 12:40.100
Do you know where he lived before that?

12:40.160 --> 12:41.930
Well, actually, Bones, that wasn't my first question.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.260
He wrote his previous address on the lease.

12:46.330 --> 12:48.360
- North Pole?
- Aw! Come on with that.

12:48.430 --> 12:49.860
See, it turned out to be a good question.

12:49.900 --> 12:51.160
You actually accepted that address?

12:51.230 --> 12:52.400
Are you kidding?

12:52.460 --> 12:53.860
How many guys want to live above a toy store?

12:53.930 --> 12:55.200
It's noisy.

12:55.260 --> 12:56.800
And Kris gave me
first and last month,

12:56.860 --> 12:59.030
up front, in cash.

12:59.100 --> 13:00.760
Kris Kringle,
from the North Pole,

13:00.830 --> 13:02.900
lives above a toy store--

13:02.960 --> 13:05.230
this is further evidence 
that our victim is, indeed,

13:05.300 --> 13:07.600
the mythic figure 
known as Santa Claus.

13:07.660 --> 13:08.930
Mythic, coming from the Latin "myth,"

13:09.000 --> 13:10.230
meaning he doesn't actually exist.

13:10.300 --> 13:13.260
No, from the Greek 
mythos, meaning "word."

13:13.330 --> 13:15.500
He does not...
right here...

13:17.130 --> 13:18.360
What can you tell us

13:18.430 --> 13:20.830
about Mr. Kringle's 
personal finances?

13:20.900 --> 13:22.600
Like I said, he always paid cash

13:22.660 --> 13:23.730
Where did he work?

13:23.800 --> 13:25.760
An employment agency 
called Temp Time,

13:25.830 --> 13:27.460
on 7th, by the Convention Center.

13:27.530 --> 13:29.030
Ha! Couldn't have been Santa.

13:29.100 --> 13:31.900
- Why?
- Because Santa wouldn't have 
worked at a temp agency.

13:31.960 --> 13:33.560
Well, why not?
His work is seasonal.

13:33.630 --> 13:35.200
It doesn't...He wouldn't...

13:36.760 --> 13:39.500
Kringle pay his rent on time?

13:39.560 --> 13:41.330
Always, at least,
until the last couple of months.

13:41.400 --> 13:42.830
Really? Just,you know what?

13:42.900 --> 13:45.260
Obviously, he wasn't short
on funds with all the money

13:45.330 --> 13:47.830
we found in the secret 
compartment of his drawer.

13:47.900 --> 13:49.160
Son of a bitch.

13:49.230 --> 13:50.830
1,200 bucks of that is mine.

13:50.900 --> 13:53.800
All of this is rumpled, small bills,

13:53.860 --> 13:56.930
except for these--eight $50 bills.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.930
Brand new, with sequential 
serial numbers.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.460
I don't know about any of this...

14:00.530 --> 14:01.800
Did you, uh...

14:01.860 --> 14:03.530
guys have some kind of 
a disagreement?

14:03.600 --> 14:05.000
Is that why he was holding out on you?

14:05.060 --> 14:07.360
No. No.

14:07.430 --> 14:09.160
No.

14:10.600 --> 14:14.500
Maybe. Kris gave me some 
ideas on a toy,

14:14.560 --> 14:16.760
which I patented and...

14:16.830 --> 14:17.960
It sold?

14:18.030 --> 14:20.060
Somebody took a picture of 
TomKat's kid with it,

14:20.130 --> 14:22.460
so it sort of took off.

14:22.530 --> 14:24.730
Wow. Kringle could have sued 
you for a chunk of that cash.

14:24.800 --> 14:26.700
He never actually 
told me he wanted a cut.

14:26.760 --> 14:27.800
Maybe...

14:27.860 --> 14:30.030
he just stopped paying his rent.

14:34.960 --> 14:36.200
Thinking of Parker?

14:36.260 --> 14:37.930
No.

14:39.100 --> 14:40.300
Thinking about your dad?

14:40.360 --> 14:41.430
No.

14:42.900 --> 14:44.160
Russ.

14:44.230 --> 14:45.700
You can't blame him

14:45.760 --> 14:48.160
for not wanting those
girls to know the truth.

14:48.230 --> 14:49.960
He's living a lie. 
You'd never do that.

14:50.030 --> 14:51.360
Well, not never.

14:51.430 --> 14:53.430
I mean, I'd...I lie to Parker,

14:53.500 --> 14:55.260
especially this time of year.

14:55.330 --> 14:56.600
What about?

14:56.660 --> 14:57.730
I tell him that Santa's coming.

14:57.800 --> 14:59.860
- Really?
- It's Santa Claus!

14:59.930 --> 15:01.530
The Santa myth is 
based on blackmail:

15:01.600 --> 15:03.560
Be good or you won't get any presents.

15:03.630 --> 15:05.900
No, it's not a lie lie, Bones.

15:05.960 --> 15:07.430
It's more like everybody agreeing

15:07.500 --> 15:09.060
that up to a certain age,

15:09.130 --> 15:11.730
kids deserve to live a 
different kind of truth.

15:11.800 --> 15:13.300
Okay. By that reasoning, 
what we should do

15:13.360 --> 15:15.400
is figure out a lie
Russ could tell the girls

15:15.460 --> 15:16.860
so they wouldn't know he was in jail.

15:16.930 --> 15:19.130
That is a brilliant Christmas idea.

15:19.200 --> 15:24.430
It was intended to be a scathing 
and incisive comment.

15:24.500 --> 15:26.560
Give Russ civvies, the girls
think he's flown in

15:26.630 --> 15:29.460
especially to visit his father 
in jail at Christmas.

15:29.530 --> 15:31.600
Where would we say he's been?

15:31.660 --> 15:35.760
Building a bridge in... Adis Ababa.

15:35.830 --> 15:38.230
Adis Ababa is the landlocked 
capital of Ethiopia.

15:38.300 --> 15:40.600
Fine, Bones. You know what?
Just make up your own lie.

15:40.660 --> 15:41.900
I don't believe in lying to children.

15:41.960 --> 15:45.530
You just want to go to Peru
without feeling guilty.

15:45.600 --> 15:46.900
You need to accept

15:46.960 --> 15:48.660
that you won't have 
Parker this Christmas.

15:51.260 --> 15:55.560
I am not enjoying
this holiday season at all.

15:55.630 --> 15:57.300
Yeah, well, neither am I.

15:59.400 --> 16:01.300
The shadow on the X ray 
is a slight depression

16:01.360 --> 16:03.430
of the outer endocranial table.

16:03.500 --> 16:05.260
Fracture's levered inward.

16:05.330 --> 16:07.160
There are no signs of remodeling.

16:07.230 --> 16:09.660
This localized staining

16:09.730 --> 16:14.800
suggests that his superficial 
temporal artery was punctured.

16:14.860 --> 16:16.830
Very likely the cause of death.

16:16.900 --> 16:18.160
So Santa was conked on the head.

16:18.230 --> 16:19.960
The question is: With what?

16:20.030 --> 16:22.230
I'll run it under the scanning 
electron microscope.

16:24.160 --> 16:25.760
So... what are you doing for Christmas?

16:25.830 --> 16:27.100
Going home to Michigan. 
What about you?

16:27.160 --> 16:29.100
Family cruise.

16:29.160 --> 16:30.930
Sounds nice.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.600
You'd think so.

16:32.660 --> 16:35.200
Let me know what you find.

16:36.360 --> 16:38.030
Kris is dead?

16:38.100 --> 16:40.030
Afraid so.

16:40.100 --> 16:42.430
Man, I had bad feeling 
something was wrong.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.430
I mean, it's not like Kris to miss work.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.600
Especially not this time of year.

16:46.660 --> 16:47.630
I called him a hundred times.

16:47.700 --> 16:49.960
Twelve. Twelve times.

16:50.030 --> 16:51.800
We listened to his answering machine.

16:51.860 --> 16:54.260
There are a lot of Santas here.

16:54.330 --> 16:55.800
Yeah, but Kris was my numero uno.

16:55.860 --> 16:57.460
I mean, all the guys knew that here.

16:57.530 --> 16:59.000
In fact, if it wasn't for him,

16:59.060 --> 17:01.830
I never would've thought about 
getting into the Santa business.

17:01.900 --> 17:04.300
Christmas is not going to be the 
same without Kris Kringle.

17:04.359 --> 17:06.460
Anthropologically, what exactly 
would it mean

17:06.530 --> 17:07.800
to be a Numero Uno Santa Claus?

17:07.859 --> 17:10.800
Well, Kris got the best gigs.

17:10.859 --> 17:12.960
Any of the other Santas-
-they get jealous?

17:13.030 --> 17:15.060
Jealous enough to kill?Come on.

17:15.130 --> 17:16.359
Is this about Kris?

17:16.430 --> 17:18.359
Did something happen to him?

17:19.960 --> 17:21.230
Who are you?

17:21.300 --> 17:22.930
I-I'm... Jeff Mantell.

17:24.060 --> 17:25.130
What happened to Kris?

17:25.200 --> 17:27.200
Kris was murdered.

17:28.930 --> 17:30.900
Everybody!

17:30.960 --> 17:34.500
The dead Santa on the 
news...it was Kris.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.360
What can you tell me about Kris?

17:41.430 --> 17:44.330
Kris made a guy proud 
to wear the uniform.

17:44.400 --> 17:45.560
That's the truth.

17:45.630 --> 17:47.160
Was-Was Kris murdered?

17:47.230 --> 17:48.330
Um, all the Santas

17:48.400 --> 17:49.730
just need to take a step back.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.900
Any help you need,
guys, anything at all.

17:51.960 --> 17:53.500
Why are you limping?

17:53.560 --> 17:54.760
Oh, my shins.
You want to see them?

17:54.830 --> 17:56.830
No... Why would I want to see
your shins?

17:56.900 --> 17:58.360
Well, children get to a certain age

17:58.430 --> 18:00.600
and they think it's hilarious 
to kick Santa in the shins.

18:00.660 --> 18:02.760
That's... I, uh...

18:02.830 --> 18:05.400
All right, I'd like to talk to anyone 
who knew Kris personally.

18:05.460 --> 18:06.800
I only met Kris at the diner, 
down the street

18:06.860 --> 18:07.900
a couple of weeks ago.

18:07.960 --> 18:09.760
Okay, whoever smells like 
the wet sweater,

18:09.830 --> 18:11.430
really needs to take a step back.

18:11.500 --> 18:13.760
I was out of work, late on my alimony,

18:13.830 --> 18:15.900
and the man saved me;
he got me this job.

18:15.960 --> 18:19.430
Sad, but familiar tale with Kris.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.100
Typical Kris.
Always looking to help out.

18:21.160 --> 18:22.730
Anybody know of any trouble?

18:22.800 --> 18:23.630
Or arguments?

18:23.700 --> 18:25.000
Differences of opinion?

18:25.060 --> 18:26.160
I can't even imagine that.

18:26.230 --> 18:29.060
No, the man was truly,
sincerely... jolly.

18:29.130 --> 18:31.230
We couldn't find a record 
of his bank account.

18:31.300 --> 18:32.730
Oh, well, I cash Kris's checks.

18:32.800 --> 18:34.260
What would Mr. Kringle do

18:34.330 --> 18:36.300
during the three other seasons?

18:36.360 --> 18:38.430
Well, Kris was my only 
full-time, temp Santa.

18:38.500 --> 18:40.260
You know, sometimes for the 
odd ad campaigns

18:40.330 --> 18:41.400
who needed a Santa.

18:41.460 --> 18:44.660
Car dealerships, ice cream parlors.

18:44.730 --> 18:46.760
Sometimes hospitals 
had Christmas in July.

18:46.830 --> 18:48.030
Ironically,

18:48.100 --> 18:50.900
the only night Kris wouldn't 
work was Christmas Eve.

18:50.960 --> 18:52.400
His special night.

18:52.460 --> 18:55.330
His night to deliver toys and 
goodies around the world.

18:56.630 --> 18:58.830
We'd always tease him about that.

18:58.900 --> 19:00.600
He never denied it.

19:03.130 --> 19:05.400
The maggots in dead Santa's collar fed

19:05.460 --> 19:07.930
on high concentrations of non-sulfated

19:08.030 --> 19:11.400
chondroitin glycosaminoglycans
and N-acetylneuramic acid.

19:11.460 --> 19:13.900
This is why Booth hates talking to you.

19:13.960 --> 19:17.600
It's the regurgitated saliva
of male Aerodramus fuciphagus.

19:17.660 --> 19:19.230
Wait, Booth hates
talking to me?

19:19.300 --> 19:21.400
Not you specifically--lab people.

19:21.460 --> 19:24.360
What's Aerodramus fuciphagus?

19:24.430 --> 19:26.160
The main ingredient in Bird's Nest Soup.

19:26.230 --> 19:27.830
It's a rare Chinese delicacy,

19:27.900 --> 19:30.260
made from the nests of swiftlets.

19:30.330 --> 19:32.330
It's more like bird spit soup, 
if you ask me.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.160
So our victim was in China?

19:34.230 --> 19:37.860
I'm thinking Chinatown is more likely.

19:37.930 --> 19:40.900
But I also found similar 
traces of the same stuff

19:40.960 --> 19:45.130
on the back of Santa's pants,
mostly on the rear end.

19:45.200 --> 19:46.300
He sat in it?

19:46.360 --> 19:47.660
Yeah, let's hope that's how it got there.

19:47.730 --> 19:49.830
How common is this dish?

19:49.860 --> 19:53.330
A single kilogram of white 
swiftlet nest cost 2 grands

19:53.400 --> 19:54.930
Let's see who makes it here in DC.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.800
Done and done.

19:56.860 --> 19:58.330
These people all seem pretty upset

19:58.400 --> 20:00.230
to have lost one of their own.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.960
I mean, they keep 
referring to "the uniform"

20:02.030 --> 20:04.560
like soldiers or cops.

20:04.630 --> 20:06.500
According to Hodgins, 
Kris Kringle was probably killed

20:06.560 --> 20:09.630
in or near a restaurant called

20:09.700 --> 20:11.460
"Kum Jug Yuen" up in Chinatown.

20:11.530 --> 20:12.830
Aw, come on.
How'd he figure that out?

20:12.900 --> 20:13.800
Do you really want to know?

20:13.860 --> 20:15.560
You tell me.
No, you don't.

20:15.630 --> 20:17.560
I'm going trust you on that.

20:17.630 --> 20:18.800
If you don't mind, I have a meeting

20:18.860 --> 20:20.430
with Caroline Julian
at your office in ten minutes.

20:20.500 --> 20:22.600
Is it about the trailer for 
your dad's Christmas?

20:22.660 --> 20:23.860
You think she'll help?

20:23.930 --> 20:25.500
Well, you know,
Caroline's a lawyer--

20:25.560 --> 20:27.500
she'll help, but she'll ask you to 
do something in return.

20:27.560 --> 20:28.530
That's fair.

20:28.600 --> 20:30.060
Yeah, hold that thought.

20:34.160 --> 20:36.500
I thought you were going to 
Brazil for Christmas.

20:36.560 --> 20:38.600
Peru.
Whatever.

20:38.660 --> 20:39.800
It's south of the equator,

20:39.860 --> 20:43.100
doing bone things with bone people.

20:43.160 --> 20:45.230
I checked with the people at the jail,

20:45.300 --> 20:46.730
and for my father to get 
the conjugal trailer,

20:46.800 --> 20:49.230
the prosecutor in 
charge of his case

20:49.300 --> 20:51.660
has to submit a written 
recommendation.

20:53.300 --> 20:55.900
You're the prosecutor in 
charge of his case.

20:55.960 --> 20:59.030
I'm aware of that.
Thank you, Dr. Brennan.

21:01.300 --> 21:03.330
So... will you?

21:03.400 --> 21:04.730
You going to Brazil and all,

21:04.800 --> 21:07.160
what's the use of Max being
in that conjugal trailer

21:07.230 --> 21:09.100
all by himself?

21:09.160 --> 21:11.060
Well, I'm trying to persuade my brother

21:11.130 --> 21:13.260
to celebrate Christmas with 
his family in there, too.

21:13.330 --> 21:16.930
A yuletide gathering of the 
Brennan criminal element.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.500
What do you mean "trying"?

21:18.560 --> 21:21.460
Russ doesn't want his 
stepdaughters to know that he's in jail.

21:21.530 --> 21:22.900
How do you persuade them otherwise

21:22.960 --> 21:26.230
if they're actually having 
Christmas in the jail?

21:26.300 --> 21:28.300
One other thing, the warden 
says "no Christmas tree."

21:28.360 --> 21:29.930
That's right. Three years ago,

21:30.000 --> 21:31.860
somebody made a 
shiv out of the star.

21:31.930 --> 21:34.400
Now, no trees or 
ornaments of any kind.

21:34.460 --> 21:36.630
Isn't that a little dreary?

21:36.700 --> 21:38.960
Hey, don't kill people, 
don't get sent to prison,

21:39.030 --> 21:41.660
have a Christmas pageant in 
your own home every year.

21:43.230 --> 21:45.330
So, will you?

21:45.400 --> 21:46.930
I will.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.560
You will?

21:48.630 --> 21:49.800
Thank you.

21:49.860 --> 21:51.700
On one condition.

21:51.760 --> 21:53.500
Booth said you'd say that.

21:53.560 --> 21:55.700
Did he say I'd ask you to kiss him?

21:55.760 --> 21:58.300
No.

21:58.360 --> 21:59.730
Well, are you?

21:59.800 --> 22:02.900
No cheeks, no noses, right on the lips.

22:02.960 --> 22:05.530
People kiss people on the nose?

22:05.600 --> 22:09.430
I want you to kiss him 
under some mistletoe.

22:09.500 --> 22:11.600
Kiss Booth?

22:11.660 --> 22:13.000
That's right, cherie.

22:13.060 --> 22:14.430
Why?

22:14.500 --> 22:16.930
Because it will amuse me.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.330
Why?

22:18.400 --> 22:19.600
Because you're all

22:19.660 --> 22:22.600
"Dr. Brennan" and 
"Special Agent Seeley Booth"

22:22.660 --> 22:25.200
and it's Christmas and 
I have a puckish side

22:25.260 --> 22:26.430
that will not be denied.

22:26.500 --> 22:27.560
- Puckish? 
- What's the matter?

22:27.630 --> 22:28.900
You don't think I can be puckish?

22:28.960 --> 22:30.130
I never thought about it

22:30.200 --> 22:31.800
until now.

22:31.860 --> 22:33.430
You want me to write that letter,

22:33.500 --> 22:35.000
you kiss Booth on the lips,

22:35.060 --> 22:38.600
for no less than one-steamboat, 
two-steamboat...

22:38.660 --> 22:40.000
five-steamboats.

22:40.060 --> 22:41.400
That's blackmail.

22:41.460 --> 22:42.560
That's correct.

22:42.630 --> 22:44.000
That's unethical.

22:44.060 --> 22:45.960
That's the deal. Take it or leave it.

22:46.030 --> 22:47.830
What about a tree?

22:47.900 --> 22:50.030
No Christmas tree. No way.

22:50.100 --> 22:53.630
Not even if you squeeze his buttocks.

22:53.700 --> 22:56.360
Well... I don't know.

22:56.430 --> 22:59.300
Couldn't I just... take you
out to dinner some time?

22:59.360 --> 23:01.700
You kiss Seeley Booth on the lips

23:01.760 --> 23:04.760
and I'll make sure your daddy 
has his dream Christmas.

23:04.830 --> 23:06.230
No tree, mind you,

23:06.300 --> 23:10.030
but otherwise, as good as an
accused murderer can expect.

23:19.060 --> 23:20.730
You ever see this man before?

23:20.800 --> 23:22.560
Santa Claus?

23:22.630 --> 23:24.900
No, this isn't actually
Santa Claus.

23:24.960 --> 23:27.100
The guy that's wearing
the Santa outfit

23:27.160 --> 23:29.160
in this picture-- have you
ev seen him?

23:29.230 --> 23:31.260
Can I see your I.D.
again, please?

23:31.330 --> 23:33.700
Booth.
What?

23:33.760 --> 23:35.160
Your kid like roaches?

23:35.230 --> 23:36.830
Gromphadorhina, man,

23:36.900 --> 23:37.900
hissing roach.

23:37.960 --> 23:39.260
Hey, grab me this container?

23:39.330 --> 23:41.600
This is a great
pet, man.

23:41.660 --> 23:42.930
Perfect Christmas gift.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.830
No. Did you find the
bird's nest maggots yet?

23:44.900 --> 23:46.400
Still looking.

23:46.460 --> 23:48.100
Okay, I'm calling
the cops.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.530
Whoa, whoa, pal, I am the cops,

23:49.600 --> 23:50.930
all right?

23:51.000 --> 23:55.330
Any fights out here back in the
alley in the past four days?

23:55.400 --> 23:57.300
No, I don't come out here
since I quit smoking.

23:57.360 --> 23:58.630
It stinks.

23:58.700 --> 24:00.100
It's the cycle of
life, my friend.

24:00.160 --> 24:01.860
Quite beautiful
if you get into it.

24:03.430 --> 24:04.460
is it? Okay, you go back inside.

24:04.530 --> 24:06.000
But tell the rest
of your staff

24:06.060 --> 24:07.460
I'll be in
in a few minutes

24:07.530 --> 24:08.500
to ask you some questions.

24:09.560 --> 24:11.030
Hey, pal,

24:11.100 --> 24:14.260
you better hope I don't report
this to the health department.

24:14.330 --> 24:16.660
Pay dirt.

24:16.730 --> 24:18.600
Fannia,

24:18.660 --> 24:21.330
Musca and Phoridae.

24:21.400 --> 24:24.660
That is the exact maggots
I found on Kringle's suit.

24:24.730 --> 24:26.960
It means this is where
he was killed.

24:27.030 --> 24:30.030
So if he was killed here...

24:30.100 --> 24:32.160
then he was probably...

24:34.260 --> 24:36.400
dragged over here...

24:36.460 --> 24:41.060
to this grate and dumped down this sewer.

24:41.130 --> 24:42.560
An ignominious end

24:42.630 --> 24:43.800
for Father Christmas, huh?

24:43.860 --> 24:46.330
Whoa.
Whoa what?

24:48.700 --> 24:50.460
They were near the bottom.

24:50.530 --> 24:52.060
No cash,

24:52.130 --> 24:54.860
just I.D.s and credit.

24:54.930 --> 24:56.960
Probably dumped there
by pickpockets.

24:57.030 --> 24:59.200
You found cash in Kringle's
apartment, right?

24:59.260 --> 25:01.160
Right.
Maybe he picked

25:01.230 --> 25:02.360
one pocket too many.

25:02.430 --> 25:03.930
Well, we're going
to find out the owners

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
of these wallets,

25:05.060 --> 25:08.930
and see if they know
any Santa pickpockets.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.460
Booth, help me out of here?

25:11.530 --> 25:12.460
See you later.

25:12.530 --> 25:14.760
Booth!

25:14.830 --> 25:17.300
Booth... Oh, come on...

25:19.330 --> 25:21.500
Vermont is gonna
be great, buddy.

25:21.560 --> 25:22.800
Snowboarding.

25:22.860 --> 25:24.400
Just like when we went
to Liberty.

25:24.460 --> 25:25.760
Mom says better
than Liberty.

25:25.830 --> 25:27.360
Well, she's right.

25:27.430 --> 25:28.430
Can't you come?

25:28.500 --> 25:30.730
Parker...
If you tell Mom

25:30.800 --> 25:32.130
that I don't want to go,

25:32.200 --> 25:33.860
then we could spend
Christmas together.

25:33.930 --> 25:35.530
Like we always do.

25:37.960 --> 25:39.700
It's not gonna happen
this year, buddy.

25:39.760 --> 25:41.760
When you get back,

25:41.830 --> 25:44.900
me and you, we'll have
our own Christmas,
just the two of us.

25:44.960 --> 25:47.060
Without Captain Fantastic.

25:47.130 --> 25:50.260
We shouldn't call Brent
"Captain Fantastic" anymore.

25:50.330 --> 25:51.700
Why? You do.

25:51.760 --> 25:53.700
Well, I won't anymore.
But it's funny.

25:53.760 --> 25:54.860
No, it's disrespectful.

25:54.930 --> 25:57.060
And if your mom
likes someone,

25:57.130 --> 25:59.560
then we should respect
that and like them, too.

25:59.630 --> 26:00.560
Is that true?

26:00.630 --> 26:02.460
You like Brent?

26:02.530 --> 26:05.060
Yeah, I do.

26:05.130 --> 26:06.260
Wow.
Bones!

26:06.330 --> 26:07.960
Are you going to be all
alone at Christmas?

26:08.030 --> 26:10.130
Me? No. I'm not
going to be alone.

26:10.200 --> 26:11.900
I'll be with Bones
and all our friends.

26:11.960 --> 26:13.100
I'm going to Peru.

26:13.160 --> 26:14.130
See? We're all going to Peru.

26:14.200 --> 26:15.530
You're having Christmas
in Africa?

26:15.600 --> 26:17.600
Actually, Peru is...
Is Africa.

26:17.660 --> 26:18.700
Isn't that right Bones?

26:18.760 --> 26:20.360
Okay? I'm going
to be just fine.

26:20.430 --> 26:24.300
So come on, go wash up
before your mom gets here
to pick you up, all right?

26:24.360 --> 26:26.330
I love you.

26:26.400 --> 26:27.860
I love you
too, buddy.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.160
Go ahead.

26:31.230 --> 26:33.860
You lied a lot to him.

26:33.930 --> 26:36.200
It's the magic
of Christmas, Bones.

26:42.300 --> 26:45.500
So you want to tell me
what happened?

26:45.560 --> 26:47.230
I'd just come out
of the check cashing place

26:47.300 --> 26:49.000
and I was off to do
some Christmas shopping.

26:49.060 --> 26:50.760
When you were
mugged by Santa.

26:50.830 --> 26:51.800
Not mugged.

26:51.860 --> 26:53.460
It was just a bump as I

26:53.530 --> 26:54.830
was walking out
of the place.

26:54.900 --> 26:56.030
I said excuse me,
he ho-ho-ho'd,

26:56.100 --> 26:57.230
we went our separate ways.

26:57.300 --> 26:59.660
When did you realize
your wallet was missing?

26:59.730 --> 27:00.800
An hour later at the PriceCo.

27:00.860 --> 27:01.900
I'm in the check-out line,

27:01.960 --> 27:03.200
I'm going to pay
and it's gone.

27:03.260 --> 27:04.830
Naturally you went back
the next day

27:04.900 --> 27:06.560
and you beat the crap out of him.

27:06.630 --> 27:09.000
I asked for my wallet back,

27:09.060 --> 27:11.530
Santa plays all dumb
and then it got physical.

27:11.600 --> 27:13.030
It was 900 bucks, man.

27:13.100 --> 27:15.630
Mr. Moussa, there are hundreds
of Santas in the DC area

27:15.700 --> 27:17.060
this time of year.

27:17.130 --> 27:22.230
Come on, you and I are trained
law enforcement officers.

27:22.300 --> 27:24.460
I got the right guy.
I mean, if it was him,

27:24.530 --> 27:26.230
he definitely deserved
a beating.
It was him.

27:26.300 --> 27:29.130
And he got off lucky, because
of my self-control.

27:29.200 --> 27:30.900
This guy, he ruined Christmas.

27:30.960 --> 27:33.260
Egyptians--
they celebrate Christmas?

27:33.330 --> 27:36.130
I am not Muslim, Agent Booth.

27:36.200 --> 27:37.330
I am Coptic.

27:37.400 --> 27:39.430
Me, my wife, my children,

27:39.500 --> 27:41.700
we all celebrate Christmas.

27:41.760 --> 27:44.330
Except for maybe not this year
because this guy took my money.

27:44.400 --> 27:45.930
And what did you do to him?

27:47.060 --> 27:48.530
I hit him.

27:50.130 --> 27:51.560
I'm not proud of that.

27:51.630 --> 27:52.930
No pushing?

27:53.000 --> 27:54.200
No tussling?

27:54.260 --> 27:55.800
Just popped him once in
the schnoz, that's it.

27:55.860 --> 27:57.560
You didn't roll around
in the alley?

27:57.630 --> 27:58.630
What alley?

27:58.700 --> 28:00.260
We were in front
of a big box store.

28:00.330 --> 28:01.960
You didn't mean to kill him.

28:02.030 --> 28:03.860
You just shoved him down
that manhole.

28:03.930 --> 28:06.130
I-I-I knocked him down,
the people, they don't know why,

28:06.200 --> 28:07.630
they don't understand,

28:07.700 --> 28:09.330
they're looking, maybe they
think I'm a terrorist,

28:09.400 --> 28:11.230
so I get out of there.

28:11.300 --> 28:15.100
Hmm. Right.

28:15.100 --> 28:17.100
Do I need a lawyer?

28:22.030 --> 28:24.000
Bones, PayFast Check
Cashing confirms

28:24.060 --> 28:25.460
cashing Moussa's paycheck.

28:25.530 --> 28:27.660
The teller gave him 900
bucks in all crisp new 50's.

28:27.730 --> 28:29.200
Kringle had new 50's
in his dresser.

28:29.260 --> 28:30.330
Yup, and the

28:30.400 --> 28:31.400
serial numbers match.

28:31.460 --> 28:32.460
Suggesting Kringle

28:32.530 --> 28:33.800
is our pickpocket.

28:33.860 --> 28:35.060
Uh-huh, so we're
getting a warrant

28:35.130 --> 28:36.830
to anaze
Moussa's clothing.

28:36.900 --> 28:39.200
If there's bird soup
goop on them,

28:39.260 --> 28:40.300
we'll know he's
our killer.

28:40.360 --> 28:41.730
What is with the mistletoe?

28:41.800 --> 28:44.130
I was going to talk
to you about this.

28:44.200 --> 28:45.460
Caroline wants us to kiss

28:45.530 --> 28:46.960
under the mistletoe.
What?!

28:47.030 --> 28:49.200
It's the only way she'll make
Christmas for my family.

28:49.260 --> 28:50.460
By having us kiss?

28:50.530 --> 28:51.460
Yes.

28:51.530 --> 28:53.130
Why?

28:53.200 --> 28:54.260
Because she's feeling puckish.

28:54.330 --> 28:56.030
Puckish? What's that mean?
Listen, Booth,

28:56.100 --> 28:57.700
she's going to be here any
second. Do you want some gum?

28:57.760 --> 28:59.560
No, my breath is just fine.

28:59.630 --> 29:01.460
All right, look, I'll have
a talk with Caroline.

29:01.530 --> 29:03.900
No.
No?

29:03.960 --> 29:05.900
I'm only telling you out
of professional courtesy.

29:05.960 --> 29:08.200
What?
So that you won't
be surprised.

29:08.260 --> 29:10.230
When you say kiss,
you mean like kiss-kiss?

29:10.300 --> 29:11.400
Like on both cheeks?

29:11.460 --> 29:12.400
No, the lips.

29:12.460 --> 29:16.360
Like brother and sister,
colleagues.

29:16.430 --> 29:17.730
French people meeting
on the street.

29:17.800 --> 29:19.260
Caroline's feeling
puckish, huh?

29:19.330 --> 29:20.600
It means playful
and impish.

29:20.660 --> 29:21.960
Congratulations.

29:22.030 --> 29:24.100
I hear you have a suspect
in the Santa slaying.

29:24.160 --> 29:26.300
Yeah, looks like
the Easter Bunny

29:26.360 --> 29:27.600
has nothing to worry about.

29:27.660 --> 29:30.230
Did you talk to the judge
about the trailer?

29:30.300 --> 29:31.730
Yes, I did.

29:31.800 --> 29:33.330
What about your end?

29:33.400 --> 29:36.000
Well, look
at that.

29:36.060 --> 29:37.000
Mistletoe.

29:37.060 --> 29:38.460
You take a step
to your right...

29:38.530 --> 29:40.630
you'll be right under
that cute little sprig.

29:57.930 --> 29:59.300
Was that enough steamboats?

29:59.360 --> 30:00.930
Plenty.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.500
A whole flotilla.

30:02.560 --> 30:08.200
I don't know what that means,
but, um.... Merry Christmas.

30:08.260 --> 30:09.360
It was like kissing my brother.

30:09.430 --> 30:11.000
You sure must like
your brother.

30:11.060 --> 30:13.300
She does.
I do.

30:13.360 --> 30:16.100
The trailer is all arranged.

30:16.160 --> 30:18.300
You're good to go, cherie.

30:18.360 --> 30:20.130
Merry Christmas.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.100
I'm sure she feels
really foolish right now.

30:26.160 --> 30:28.130
Yeah...

30:30.730 --> 30:34.360
Well, hey, I really should...
I should get back

30:34.460 --> 30:36.230
and see if
the forensic guy

30:36.300 --> 30:38.300
has got anything yet
on Moussa's...

30:38.360 --> 30:39.800
That's a good idea.

30:39.860 --> 30:41.360
Yeah, I've got stuff...

30:41.430 --> 30:42.500
to do, too.

30:42.560 --> 30:44.630
Yeah.
The... for... with bones.

30:44.700 --> 30:46.760
I understand completely.

30:48.900 --> 30:51.160
Thanks for the gum.

30:52.430 --> 30:53.930
How you doing?

30:54.000 --> 30:55.060
Hey.

30:56.360 --> 30:58.630
Some metallic flakes
imbedded in the bone.

30:58.700 --> 30:59.860
Trying to help Zack determine

30:59.930 --> 31:01.930
what kind of
weapon was used.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.560
You know, this is our
first Christmas as a couple.

31:05.630 --> 31:08.160
Aw, too bad Santa's dead.

31:08.230 --> 31:12.930
I thought that we
could make Christmas
decorations for our tree.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.860
Is that too corny?

31:14.930 --> 31:16.500
It's what my family
did when I was little

31:16.560 --> 31:18.660
and I always thought,
you know,

31:18.730 --> 31:22.200
when I had my own family, that
I'd carry on the tradition.

31:22.260 --> 31:23.760
Are two people a family?

31:23.830 --> 31:25.760
Isn't that how every
family starts?

31:25.830 --> 31:28.160
Then I think us
making decorations

31:28.230 --> 31:30.760
is just corny enough.

31:37.300 --> 31:39.160
I don't understand, has there
been some kind of crisis?

31:39.230 --> 31:41.130
Yes, I have a crisis.
Bones, it was
just mistletoe.

31:43.360 --> 31:44.600
Not the kiss.
That was nothing.

31:44.660 --> 31:45.730
You kissed?

31:45.800 --> 31:47.560
Mistletoe!
That's not the crisis.

31:47.630 --> 31:49.030
Was there tongue?

31:49.100 --> 31:51.060
All right, you know what,
get your own sex life.

31:51.130 --> 31:52.500
That has nothing
to do with sex.

31:52.560 --> 31:53.500
Nothing.
No.

31:53.560 --> 31:54.630
There was no...

31:54.700 --> 31:55.960
It was mistletoe.
Totally sexless.

31:56.030 --> 31:58.460
I'm all ears.

31:59.560 --> 32:01.500
Just take your hat off there.

32:04.100 --> 32:07.230
Booth, who is a very
honest person, says that
at this time of year,

32:07.300 --> 32:10.500
deception is necessary for the
happiness of little children.

32:10.560 --> 32:11.900
I'm being misquoted.

32:11.960 --> 32:14.030
Booth is absolutely right.
She got the gist.

32:14.100 --> 32:16.130
Yeah, there's a fictional
element to Christmas.

32:16.200 --> 32:17.260
You mean the whole

32:17.330 --> 32:18.600
"Birth of a Savior" rigmarole?

32:18.660 --> 32:19.630
It is not rigmarole.

32:19.700 --> 32:21.260
No, no,
Dr. Brennan.
How do you know?

32:21.330 --> 32:24.460
It's-It's the, uh,
feeling of Christmas.

32:24.530 --> 32:26.960
What people call
"The Christmas Spirit."

32:27.030 --> 32:28.400
It's a kind of dream or hope

32:28.460 --> 32:30.200
that we carry with us
from childhood.

32:30.260 --> 32:31.230
But as adults...

32:31.300 --> 32:33.260
Are you including
you in that?

32:33.330 --> 32:37.230
As adults, we're imbued by
the pragmatic routines of life,

32:37.300 --> 32:39.400
which makes it difficult
for us to regard anything

32:39.460 --> 32:41.060
with childlike wonder.

32:41.130 --> 32:43.130
But, you know, it's all right
for us to try.

32:43.200 --> 32:46.700
We put on silly hats and drape
trees with sparkly lights

32:46.760 --> 32:49.460
and wrap gifts in garish paper,
and that's good for us.

32:49.530 --> 32:51.160
It's not only all right
to allow children

32:51.230 --> 32:54.430
the transient experience
of innocence and joy,

32:54.500 --> 32:56.900
it's our responsibility.

32:56.960 --> 32:59.400
Okay.

32:59.460 --> 33:01.100
Okay?

33:01.160 --> 33:02.930
I found that very helpful.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.760
What do you think
I've been saying

33:04.830 --> 33:05.930
for the past four days?

33:08.630 --> 33:10.660
You're going to help me
lie to the girls?

33:10.730 --> 33:13.660
Apparently, it's not
morally wrong to lie

33:13.730 --> 33:14.700
at Christmas.

33:14.760 --> 33:15.930
What if they
know I'm lying?

33:16.000 --> 33:19.300
Apparently, sometimes
lying is a kind of gift.

33:19.360 --> 33:21.260
I'm hazy on the rules,

33:21.330 --> 33:23.160
but the idea is even if
they know you're lying,

33:23.230 --> 33:24.630
they know you're doing
it out of love.

33:24.700 --> 33:25.660
Where are you
getting this?

33:25.730 --> 33:27.060
Because I'm in jail,

33:27.130 --> 33:28.360
and I'm getting better advice.

33:28.430 --> 33:31.100
Look, Russ, we have a plan.

33:31.160 --> 33:32.530
I bring you some
civilian clothes,

33:32.600 --> 33:34.200
the girls think

33:34.260 --> 33:36.030
you popped in from Addis Ababa.

33:36.100 --> 33:37.360
Addis Ababa?

33:37.430 --> 33:38.630
Well, what did you
and Amy tell them?

33:38.700 --> 33:41.260
We said I went to Burma.
Burma?

33:41.330 --> 33:43.160
Who cares where we chose?
Burma's on the other
side of the world.

33:43.230 --> 33:45.130
Russ, Burma doesn't
even exist anymore.

33:45.200 --> 33:47.800
What happened to it?
It became Myanmar.

33:47.860 --> 33:50.760
There's another problem
with the trailer.

33:50.830 --> 33:52.200
No Christmas tree.

33:52.260 --> 33:53.360
Why?

33:53.430 --> 33:55.130
Shank material.

33:55.200 --> 33:56.400
Is it important?

33:56.460 --> 33:58.900
Christmas with no tree?

33:58.960 --> 34:00.160
It's a disaster. Forget it.

34:00.230 --> 34:02.360
They're young, Russ.

34:02.430 --> 34:04.130
They believe in Santa Claus.

34:04.200 --> 34:05.660
They believe
in you because

34:05.730 --> 34:08.060
you love them, and
they'll sit in your lap

34:08.130 --> 34:09.560
and they'll open
their presents

34:09.630 --> 34:11.530
and they'll believe
in you and Burma

34:11.600 --> 34:13.960
and maybe they won't notice
that there's no tree.

34:14.030 --> 34:15.630
Look, Amy will be there,

34:15.699 --> 34:17.400
Dad will be there,
the girls will be there.

34:17.460 --> 34:18.900
And you?

34:18.960 --> 34:21.429
I was going to, but...

34:21.500 --> 34:23.400
we're not the only people
getting the trailer

34:23.460 --> 34:25.400
and I thought it would
be in the afternoon,

34:25.460 --> 34:26.800
but now it's
Christmas Eve and...

34:26.860 --> 34:29.560
I gotta be on that plane.

34:29.630 --> 34:30.860
To Peru?

34:30.929 --> 34:33.000
Yeah.

34:33.060 --> 34:36.429
Tempe, Dad wants us all. And you are one of us

34:41.100 --> 34:42.960
You found what
killed Kris Kringle?

34:43.030 --> 34:44.630
We know what it was made of.

34:44.699 --> 34:46.360
And we know the shape.

34:47.659 --> 34:49.600
Something crescent-shaped

34:49.699 --> 34:50.900
and brass?

34:50.960 --> 34:52.560
I couldn't find
anything this shape,

34:52.630 --> 34:54.800
but by making a slight
paradigm shift...

34:54.860 --> 34:56.330
The paradigm shift was my idea.

34:56.400 --> 34:59.460
And slightly change the angle...

34:59.530 --> 35:00.900
A circle, not a crescent.

35:00.960 --> 35:02.930
I believe the mark left
on Kris Kringle's skull

35:03.000 --> 35:05.300
was the result of being struck
with a circular object

35:05.360 --> 35:07.460
approximately 15 centimeters
in diameter.

35:07.530 --> 35:08.730
Six inches.

35:08.800 --> 35:10.100
A bell.

35:10.160 --> 35:11.830
A brass bell.

35:11.900 --> 35:14.030
Meaning he was probably
attacked by another Santa.

35:15.730 --> 35:17.260
Everybody have your bells?

35:18.600 --> 35:20.360
Aw, right, right!

35:20.430 --> 35:21.860
Enough! Stop!

35:24.000 --> 35:26.060
You can tell the elves
they can go now.

35:26.130 --> 35:27.700
Elves go for coffee.

35:27.760 --> 35:28.900
See you later.
Excuse me.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.300
What's the use of
Elves without Santa?

35:30.360 --> 35:31.430
Those bells are all the same.

35:31.500 --> 35:32.960
Yeah, I buy 'em in bulk.

35:33.030 --> 35:34.530
I sell them
to the Santas for cost,

35:34.600 --> 35:36.060
Is that Kris's idea?

35:36.130 --> 35:37.960
Yeah, how did you know?
Just getting a feel
for the guy.

35:38.030 --> 35:41.630
Listen we have a warrant 
here to inspect your bells.

35:41.700 --> 35:42.860
Inspect our what?

35:42.930 --> 35:44.960
Bells, Larry.
Uh, why?

35:45.030 --> 35:47.360
Agent Booth and I are going
to swab each of your bells

35:47.430 --> 35:49.730
with a cotton ball
soaked in phenolthalein.

35:49.800 --> 35:50.730
Is it gonna sting?

35:50.800 --> 35:53.100
Bells, Larry. She said bells.

35:53.160 --> 35:54.730
You need a hearing aid,
Larry.

35:54.800 --> 35:56.260
Why are they antisepticising
our bells?

35:56.330 --> 35:59.400
Ho, ho, ho, ho, steady
there, Santa.

35:59.460 --> 36:01.900
Why do you need a warrant
to disinfect a bell?

36:01.960 --> 36:02.960
What's the matter there, Santa?

36:03.030 --> 36:04.260
They're looking for something

36:04.330 --> 36:05.930
and they're not telling us.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.530
Look, I read the warrant.
It's the law.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.060
Just give him the bell.
It's no biggie.

36:10.130 --> 36:11.830
Jeff, just show them
the bell.

36:11.900 --> 36:14.060
No.

36:14.130 --> 36:15.830
Listen, buddy, I'm
not going to see my son

36:15.900 --> 36:18.000
for Christmas this year, so I'm
a little annoyed with Christmas

36:18.060 --> 36:19.730
and everything that
comes along with it.

36:19.800 --> 36:21.560
So give the lady the bell.

36:21.630 --> 36:22.800
Give her
the bell.

36:22.860 --> 36:24.530
Come on, go ahead.

36:24.600 --> 36:26.300
Thank you.

36:27.830 --> 36:29.960
The brass plating
on this bell is chipped.

36:33.430 --> 36:34.730
Oh, look at that.

36:34.800 --> 36:36.830
Okay, Santa, you're under
arrest for murder.

36:36.900 --> 36:38.060
What?

36:38.130 --> 36:39.760
That bell is the weapon
that killed Kris Kringle.

36:39.830 --> 36:42.530
No. No, no, no.
I didn't kill Kris.

36:42.600 --> 36:44.260
Come on, guys,
we switch bells all the time.

36:44.330 --> 36:46.060
Now that's true.

36:46.130 --> 36:48.460
All of our bells
are identical, you know.

36:48.530 --> 36:51.700
We put one down and then
we just pick up another.

36:51.760 --> 36:53.530
Okay, just hold on to your
bells there for a second.

36:53.600 --> 36:54.530
Any ideas?

36:54.600 --> 36:56.600
No.

36:56.660 --> 36:58.130
Come on, think Bones,
paint the picture.

36:58.200 --> 36:59.460
It's got to be
one of these guys.

36:59.530 --> 37:02.560
I mean, half of these guys
owe Kringle the money.

37:02.630 --> 37:04.260
One of them's a pickpocket.

37:04.330 --> 37:05.630
Gets money from the Egyptian.

37:05.700 --> 37:07.600
Can we go?
Cool your jets,
Santa.

37:07.660 --> 37:09.760
Go have a cookie
and some egg nog.

37:10.830 --> 37:12.100
Kringle gets suspicious,

37:12.160 --> 37:14.100
he catches the pickpocketer
dumping the wallet

37:14.160 --> 37:15.460
in the Dumpster,
confronts him...

37:15.530 --> 37:18.200
We have to sniff
their behinds.
We have to sniff...

37:18.260 --> 37:19.930
You lost me there.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.060
Everybody up
against the wall!

37:22.130 --> 37:23.630
Or, okay,
put your hands

37:23.700 --> 37:26.630
on the table.
First of all
that's my job,

37:26.700 --> 37:28.060
and second... why?

37:28.130 --> 37:29.560
They fought.

37:29.630 --> 37:32.760
They rolled around through
the bird's nest soup goop.

37:32.830 --> 37:34.860
Right. Good thinking.
That's good.
Thank you.

37:34.930 --> 37:36.560
Except for the sniffing
their butts thing.

37:36.630 --> 37:39.100
Okay, you start over
there, I'll start here.

37:39.160 --> 37:40.600
Wait, wait, wait.
You're going to sniff my guys?

37:44.730 --> 37:46.830
Geez. All right,
this is officially

37:46.900 --> 37:49.330
the worst Christmas ever.

37:54.160 --> 37:56.100
Don't you need
a warrant for this?

37:56.160 --> 37:57.730
Hey, pal, why don't
you just be quiet?

37:57.800 --> 38:00.460
Turn around.
Yeah.

38:02.360 --> 38:04.430
Bird's nest soup.
Bird's nest soup.

38:04.500 --> 38:05.530
It's Jeff! He killed Kris!

38:05.600 --> 38:07.360
Jeff killed Kris!

38:08.430 --> 38:09.700
Are you going to pull them off?

38:09.760 --> 38:11.100
Fine. Watch this.

38:11.160 --> 38:12.300
Hey!

38:12.360 --> 38:14.160
How do you like
it now, Santas?

38:14.230 --> 38:15.360
Get off of him.

38:15.430 --> 38:17.100
Everybody off.

38:17.160 --> 38:20.430
On your feet. You're
under arrest. Let's go.

38:20.500 --> 38:23.160
The man is a disgrace
to his uniform.

40:12.800 --> 40:15.960
He's fine, Rebecca.

40:16.030 --> 40:17.430
Now just listen.

40:17.500 --> 40:20.160
I will get him back
to you in time tomorrow

40:20.230 --> 40:22.400
before you leave
for Vermont.

40:22.460 --> 40:24.160
I hate Vermont.

40:24.230 --> 40:26.560
No, I didn't tell
him to say that.

40:26.630 --> 40:28.830
He didn't have
to find the FBI,

40:28.900 --> 40:31.130
he just went up
to a cop on the street

40:31.200 --> 40:32.660
and told him he was lost

40:32.730 --> 40:35.660
and said that his dad
works at the FBI.

41:06.800 --> 41:08.300
Come on, in you go.

41:08.360 --> 41:10.260
That's it. Okay, buddy,
here's the deal.

41:10.330 --> 41:12.230
We get to spend
Christmas day together,

41:12.300 --> 41:15.660
but then I got to take
you to Vermont, understand?

41:15.730 --> 41:17.000
Okay.
Will you miss Africa?

41:17.060 --> 41:18.860
Africa?

41:18.930 --> 41:21.900
No. I'd rather spend
time with you.

41:21.960 --> 41:24.230
Do we got a tree?

41:24.300 --> 41:25.530
We got two trees.

41:25.600 --> 41:27.630
Two trees?
Two.

41:27.700 --> 41:28.660
Why?

41:28.730 --> 41:30.330
Come on, I'll show you.

41:33.200 --> 41:35.600
Here, I want you
to try this, honey.

41:35.660 --> 41:37.660
Are they having fun?

41:37.730 --> 41:40.230
What are you talking about?
Of course they are.

41:40.300 --> 41:42.330
And by the way, this
is the best Christmas

41:42.400 --> 41:44.130
that I have had
in 16 years.

41:44.200 --> 41:46.330
Me, too.

41:50.230 --> 41:51.300
Oh, my God.

41:51.360 --> 41:53.330
What's wrong?

41:53.400 --> 41:56.330
What is this?
It's just a little good cheer
I made under the mattress.

41:56.400 --> 41:57.330
Booth?

41:57.400 --> 41:59.400
Bones, hey, good news.

41:59.460 --> 42:01.030
Turns out I got Parker

42:01.100 --> 42:02.260
for Christmas after all.

42:02.330 --> 42:04.260
Christmas magic, right?

42:04.330 --> 42:06.060
Hey, so we figured we'd call

42:06.130 --> 42:08.400
and wish you a little
yuletide cheer.

42:08.460 --> 42:10.360
Merry Christmas, Bones.

42:10.430 --> 42:12.030
Thanks, Parker.

42:12.100 --> 42:13.600
Hey, if that's Booth,
you wish him

42:13.660 --> 42:14.900
merry Christmas
for me, will you?

42:14.960 --> 42:16.330
My dad says merry Christmas.

42:16.400 --> 42:19.200
Listen, Bones, I got
a little something for you.

42:19.260 --> 42:21.060
Oh, I got you something, too.
We can, um...

42:21.130 --> 42:23.100
exchange gifts in
a couple days.

42:23.160 --> 42:25.200
Go to the window
and open up the blinds now.

42:25.260 --> 42:27.160
What?

42:36.500 --> 42:39.200
Hey... everybody,

42:39.260 --> 42:41.400
it looks like we got
our tree after all.

42:41.460 --> 42:43.600
What?! A tree?!

42:43.660 --> 42:47.030
Oh, my gosh!
So exciting!

42:47.100 --> 42:49.100
Yes!
Isn't it pretty?

42:49.160 --> 42:52.630
Merry Christmas.

42:52.700 --> 42:56.800
I love my gift, Booth.

42:56.860 --> 42:58.560
Merry Christmas, Bones.
