WEBVTT

00:04.627 --> 00:05.214
I didn't expect Sam to come back.

00:05.383 --> 00:08.004
The minute he walked through
that door, I knew it was over.

00:08.219 --> 00:10.093
There's something wrong with me.
I need help.

00:10.263 --> 00:13.347
Ugh! It's his soul. It's gone.

00:13.516 --> 00:14.631
So where is it?

00:14.809 --> 00:16.802
In the cage with Michael and Lucifer.

00:16.978 --> 00:18.852
Just get it back.
It's not possible.

00:19.022 --> 00:22.722
You've got no instinct.
I mean, you are seriously messed up.

00:24.027 --> 00:26.019
I don't know what you are,
you're not Sam.

00:26.195 --> 00:27.738
- Dean, come on.
- Stop pretending.

00:27.947 --> 00:29.572
- You were right.
- About?

00:30.533 --> 00:31.944
I'm not your brother.

00:32.118 --> 00:34.158
Like, I don't even really care
about you.

00:34.329 --> 00:37.116
And maybe I should feel guilty,
but I don't.

01:12.325 --> 01:14.697
- Did you see that?
- See what?

01:17.205 --> 01:19.032
There's something out there.

01:19.499 --> 01:20.874
Patrick.

01:24.796 --> 01:26.788
Something out in the corn.

01:35.056 --> 01:37.594
Patrick, you're freaking me out.

01:38.559 --> 01:40.599
I'm just having a quick look.

01:42.272 --> 01:43.647
Patrick.

01:43.982 --> 01:45.061
Patrick.

01:53.950 --> 01:55.741
Patrick.

01:57.120 --> 01:58.234
Patrick.

02:17.640 --> 02:20.392
- Patrick!
- Aah!

02:32.155 --> 02:34.028
Patrick.

03:22.121 --> 03:25.288
I'm here because I believe Elwood,
Indiana has become a center...

03:25.458 --> 03:27.000
of extraterrestrial activity.

03:27.168 --> 03:31.166
There was this light
and then Patrick just vanished.

03:31.339 --> 03:32.881
It's all happening, you know?

03:33.049 --> 03:38.968
I mean, these entities have come
to help push humanity to the next stage.

03:39.138 --> 03:43.717
My name is Wayne Whittaker, Jr. and
I have recorded eyewitness accounts.

03:43.893 --> 03:48.270
Strange lights in the sky, mysterious
presences attempting contact.

03:48.439 --> 03:51.440
Since this whole damn circus
has blown into town...

03:51.609 --> 03:55.061
no one seems to realize we got
four missing-persons cases, wide-open.

03:55.238 --> 03:56.780
My friends have lost loved ones.

03:56.948 --> 04:00.198
What happened to him?
Something took him. I know it.

04:00.368 --> 04:04.200
We are right in the middle of what we
in the field like to call a UFO flap...

04:04.372 --> 04:06.828
and I am as happy
as a pig in shoes. Heh.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.333
I can guarantee you this has nothing
to do with UFOs...

04:10.503 --> 04:14.335
or little green men
or anything extraterrestrial whatsoever.

04:14.507 --> 04:16.749
Of course it's not UFOs.

04:16.926 --> 04:18.586
It's fairies.

04:19.596 --> 04:21.173
Fairies?

04:21.346 --> 04:23.470
Okay. Well, uh,
well thank you for your input.

04:23.641 --> 04:25.634
Flying saucers not insane enough
for you?

04:25.810 --> 04:27.719
What newspaper you say
you worked for?

04:27.895 --> 04:30.387
You want glitter
to that glue you're sniffing, fine.

04:30.565 --> 04:33.186
Don't dump your wackadoo over us,
we'd rather not step in it.

04:33.359 --> 04:35.731
- We're done.
- You're missing a couple dozen cats.

04:36.070 --> 04:38.277
Yeah. It's a blood sugar thing.

04:38.448 --> 04:39.646
My apologies.

04:39.824 --> 04:42.030
- What?
- "What?" You gotta ask?

04:42.201 --> 04:43.993
Right, yes. You do have to ask.

04:44.162 --> 04:47.613
Sorry, but this is all a big joke.
We're not taking this crap seriously?

04:47.790 --> 04:49.830
ET is made of rubber,
everybody knows that.

04:50.001 --> 04:52.955
There are four vanishings in this town.
Something's going on.

04:53.129 --> 04:56.332
Sam, by the way, it's not
the lady's fault she took the brown acid.

04:56.507 --> 04:59.544
- Yeah? So?
- Empathy, man. Empathy.

04:59.719 --> 05:03.847
I mean, the old Sam would have gave
her some wussified, dew-eyed crap.

05:04.015 --> 05:05.213
Old Sam had a soul.

05:05.391 --> 05:06.969
Was a soul. Whatever.

05:07.143 --> 05:09.812
Right. Yes. And-But you don't.

05:09.979 --> 05:11.390
Or aren't. Whatever.

05:11.564 --> 05:13.142
Right, right.

05:13.316 --> 05:15.605
Why-You don't care.

05:15.777 --> 05:17.354
- Well-
- You have to care.

05:17.528 --> 05:20.019
- About what, exactly?
- About everything, man.

05:20.198 --> 05:21.775
About being human, at least.

05:21.950 --> 05:25.365
Look, Dean, you obviously care a lot
and that's great.

05:25.536 --> 05:28.027
But I can't care about what-

05:28.206 --> 05:31.123
What I can't care about, you know?

05:31.501 --> 05:34.074
- What do you want me to do, fake it?
- Yes.

05:34.254 --> 05:36.579
Absolutely. Fake it.
Fake it till you make it.

05:36.756 --> 05:39.377
What happened to you wanting me
to be all honest?

05:39.550 --> 05:42.670
Hey, you wanna be a real boy, Pinocchio,
you gotta act the part.

05:42.845 --> 05:45.763
I was faking it. Ever since
we got back on the road together.

05:45.932 --> 05:47.924
I was picking every word.
It's exhausting.

05:48.101 --> 05:51.185
Okay. All right. But until we get you
back on the soul train...

05:51.354 --> 05:53.145
I'll be your conscience, okay?

05:54.274 --> 05:56.943
So you're saying
you'll be my Jiminy Cricket.

05:57.568 --> 05:59.478
Shut up.
But, yeah, you freaking puppet.

06:00.196 --> 06:02.521
That's exactly what I'm saying.

06:17.880 --> 06:20.288
- Mr. Brennan?
- Hmm?

06:21.134 --> 06:23.541
<i>We're with the Mirror,
we'd just like to ask you-</i>

06:23.720 --> 06:24.799
What?

06:24.971 --> 06:26.086
Is this about Patrick?

06:27.807 --> 06:29.088
Patrick's gone.

06:29.976 --> 06:33.808
Missing, right, yes. That's what
we wanna talk to you about.

06:34.564 --> 06:37.269
- Your son was the first to disappear.
- First to be taken.

06:40.820 --> 06:41.899
Taken?

06:44.616 --> 06:45.896
Get out.

06:46.075 --> 06:47.155
Out.

06:47.327 --> 06:51.075
Mr. Brennan,
who do you believe took your son?

06:51.247 --> 06:52.789
You people can't help me.

06:54.042 --> 06:55.833
My boy is never coming back.

06:56.127 --> 06:58.583
- You sound awfully sure.
- Excuse me?

06:58.755 --> 07:00.415
You know something
you're not talking about.

07:00.590 --> 07:01.704
Okay. All right.

07:03.134 --> 07:06.883
You know what they say, 72 hours.

07:07.055 --> 07:11.135
After that, the odds of finding
a missing person drop to nothing, right?

07:11.309 --> 07:12.803
Well, every case is different.

07:14.646 --> 07:15.844
It's been weeks.

07:17.357 --> 07:18.851
Right.

07:19.609 --> 07:21.269
Listen...

07:21.819 --> 07:25.769
call us if anything comes to mind.

07:41.547 --> 07:43.457
Is that all right?

07:49.389 --> 07:52.093
- What do you think?
- I think he's hiding something.

07:52.267 --> 07:55.552
Stay, watch the watchmaker. See what
happens when the sun goes down.

07:55.728 --> 07:57.555
- I'll check out the crop circles.
- Okey-dokey.

07:57.730 --> 08:02.891
But do not engage with, maim,
or in any way kill Brennan.

08:03.069 --> 08:06.818
I don't want you making judgment calls.
Anything happens, call me.

08:07.156 --> 08:10.360
You know, Jiminy, I was on my own
for a whole year.

08:10.535 --> 08:11.697
I did fine without you.

08:12.036 --> 08:15.452
Yeah, I don't wanna know
your definition of fine.

08:52.076 --> 08:53.868
- What?
- Only thing this guy's up to...

08:54.037 --> 08:56.029
- is alcoholism.
- Good.

08:56.205 --> 08:57.700
I should go talk to him again.

08:57.874 --> 09:00.199
<i>I mean, you're the one who said
he's hiding something.</i>

09:00.793 --> 09:02.074
Shh, shh.

09:03.755 --> 09:06.376
<i>What? You see something?</i>

09:07.342 --> 09:09.168
<i>Dean? What's out there?</i>

09:10.386 --> 09:12.178
Hang on a second.

09:23.232 --> 09:24.940
Holy-

09:25.818 --> 09:27.361
UFO. UFO!

09:27.528 --> 09:29.936
Oh, dude, stop yelling.
You're breaking up.

09:30.114 --> 09:34.278
- I didn't catch that last part.
- Close encounter. Close encounter.

09:34.661 --> 09:36.119
Close encounter?

09:36.287 --> 09:37.829
What kind? First? Second?

09:38.247 --> 09:39.623
They're after me.

09:39.791 --> 09:43.160
Third kind already. You better run.
The fourth kind is a butt thing.

09:43.336 --> 09:45.827
Empathy, Sam. Empathy.

09:47.006 --> 09:48.500
<i>- One more.
- Yeah.</i>

09:48.675 --> 09:50.418
They still after you?

10:01.646 --> 10:03.188
Come on!

10:07.777 --> 10:10.019
<i>Dean? Are you there?</i>

10:10.196 --> 10:11.275
<i>What happened?</i>

10:11.447 --> 10:12.823
Dean?

10:19.414 --> 10:21.205
Thanks.

11:40.369 --> 11:42.657
So they're real. UFOs.

11:43.246 --> 11:46.662
Like I said before, son,
the truth is out there.

11:47.709 --> 11:50.461
Okay. You're the expert.
How do I get them?

11:51.755 --> 11:53.000
Come again?

11:53.340 --> 11:56.756
Well, you hunt ETs, right?
I need to know how to get them.

11:58.178 --> 11:59.886
Uh, you and me both.

12:11.900 --> 12:13.311
This is it?

12:13.485 --> 12:15.727
I'd say that 30 years
of eyewitness accounts...

12:15.904 --> 12:17.980
speak for themselves as proof.

12:18.156 --> 12:21.775
Yeah, right. My brother was abducted,
so I'm good on the whole proof part.

12:21.952 --> 12:24.277
- Your brother was abducted?
- Yeah.

12:24.454 --> 12:25.949
- Oh, my God.
- It's fine.

12:26.123 --> 12:27.866
I mean, I've had time to adjust.

12:28.583 --> 12:30.208
Did it happen when you were kids?

12:30.877 --> 12:32.621
No, like half an hour ago.

12:33.255 --> 12:35.627
You've been hunting UFOs
for over three decades...

12:35.799 --> 12:37.507
and you have no concrete data...

12:37.676 --> 12:39.715
- and zero workable leads.
- Well, I-

12:39.886 --> 12:43.421
Have you considered the possibility
that you suck at hunting UFOs?

12:49.396 --> 12:51.389
I'd like to help.

12:52.691 --> 12:54.066
If I can.

13:25.515 --> 13:27.971
- Dean.
- What the hell?

13:29.061 --> 13:30.140
Oh, that's Dean?

13:30.604 --> 13:33.807
Sam, they brought your brother back.

13:34.399 --> 13:35.514
Huh.

13:40.280 --> 13:41.609
Okay.

13:41.782 --> 13:44.273
It's all right, Sam.
I so totally understand.

13:44.451 --> 13:45.696
You need time as a family.

13:49.373 --> 13:51.412
But it's just-

13:51.583 --> 13:52.912
What were they like?

13:55.253 --> 13:58.836
They were grabby, incandescent
douche bags. Good night.

13:59.007 --> 14:01.296
- Too soon.
- Okay.

14:08.266 --> 14:09.429
You're upset.

14:16.984 --> 14:19.060
I was abducted...

14:19.236 --> 14:20.896
and you were banging Patchouli.

14:22.280 --> 14:23.775
I didn't think she smelled bad.

14:23.949 --> 14:26.487
- I was abducted by aliens.
- I was looking into it.

14:26.660 --> 14:28.699
- I was gone for like an hour.
- An hour?

14:28.870 --> 14:30.662
Most of that
was walking back to town.

14:30.831 --> 14:32.870
Your watch is off.
You been gone all night.

14:33.041 --> 14:35.532
What are you talking about?
No, I haven't.

14:37.045 --> 14:39.619
- Four a. m.?
- Yeah.

14:40.090 --> 14:41.169
UFO timeslip.

14:43.385 --> 14:46.469
That actually falls in line
with a lot of abduction stories.

14:46.638 --> 14:48.049
"Falls in line"?

14:48.473 --> 14:51.558
- Just falls in-
- Yeah.

14:52.227 --> 14:54.848
Nothing's "falling in line."

14:55.022 --> 14:56.267
Here.

14:56.440 --> 14:57.982
Drink.

15:00.319 --> 15:01.398
- Good.
- Thank you.

15:01.570 --> 15:03.812
Yeah. Now...

15:03.989 --> 15:05.483
come on.

15:05.657 --> 15:07.401
Talk to me.

15:07.576 --> 15:09.236
What happened?

15:11.163 --> 15:12.705
Well, uh...

15:14.249 --> 15:15.494
there was this, uh-

15:17.753 --> 15:21.501
God help me, Sam,
there was this bright white light.

15:24.009 --> 15:25.551
It's okay.

15:26.720 --> 15:27.799
Safe room.

15:34.645 --> 15:37.266
And suddenly I was-I-

15:37.439 --> 15:38.850
I was in a different place...

15:39.941 --> 15:44.603
and there were these beings,
and they were too bright to look at.

15:44.780 --> 15:50.022
But I could feel them pulling me
towards this sort of table.

15:50.202 --> 15:52.907
- Probing table.
- God, don't say that out loud.

15:53.080 --> 15:55.286
Right. Uh, so, what did you do?

15:57.751 --> 15:59.542
I went crazy.

16:00.212 --> 16:04.459
I started hacking
and slashing and firing.

16:06.134 --> 16:09.219
Heh. They actually seemed surprised.

16:11.390 --> 16:13.678
I don't think anybody's
ever done that before.

16:15.060 --> 16:16.471
Yeah.

16:16.853 --> 16:19.142
I had a close encounter, Sam...

16:19.314 --> 16:21.106
and I won.

16:22.234 --> 16:25.685
- You should take a shower.
- I should take a shower.

16:25.862 --> 16:28.151
I'm gonna take a shower now.

16:31.994 --> 16:35.327
So on top of all the demons
and the angels...

16:35.497 --> 16:39.495
and ghosts, and the skinwalkers,
it turns out that there's-

16:41.920 --> 16:46.381
So if aliens are actually real,
what's next, huh? Hobbits? Seriously.

16:52.681 --> 16:54.970
You just gave her the silent
"How you doing?"

16:55.142 --> 16:57.893
- What?
- Our reality is collapsing around us...

16:58.061 --> 17:00.433
and you're trying
to pick up our waitress?

17:01.440 --> 17:03.765
Yeah. Okay. Look.

17:03.942 --> 17:06.231
Ahem. That brings up a question.

17:06.403 --> 17:09.986
You got a soul and you're on a case,
your brother gets abducted by aliens.

17:10.156 --> 17:12.861
- You do everything to get him back.
- Right. You do.

17:13.035 --> 17:15.821
But what about when there are
no more leads for the night?

17:15.996 --> 17:19.329
I mean, are you supposed to just
sit there in the dark and suffer...

17:19.499 --> 17:21.242
even when there's nothing
that can be done?

17:21.417 --> 17:23.707
- Yes! Yes.
- What?

17:24.796 --> 17:27.085
You sit in the dark
and you feel the loss.

17:27.965 --> 17:31.252
Absolutely.
But couldn't I just do all that...

17:31.428 --> 17:34.049
- and have sex with the hippie chick?
- No.

17:34.222 --> 17:37.259
- It would be in the dark.
- No, because you would be suffering.

17:37.434 --> 17:40.305
And you can't just turn that off
for the night.

17:40.687 --> 17:42.929
- Thanks, guys.
- Thank you.

17:47.194 --> 17:49.103
- Why not?
- Because if you had a soul...

17:49.279 --> 17:51.687
your soul wouldn't let you.

17:52.783 --> 17:58.073
So you're saying
having a soul equals suffering.

17:59.581 --> 18:01.953
Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.

18:02.668 --> 18:06.286
Like the million times
you almost called Lisa.

18:06.838 --> 18:09.839
So you're saying suffering
is a good thing.

18:10.008 --> 18:12.215
I'm saying it's the only game in town.

18:14.596 --> 18:15.877
Okay.

18:16.056 --> 18:18.761
So how do we deal
with the little green men?

18:19.142 --> 18:20.553
Research.

18:20.727 --> 18:25.888
We got about a century of UFO lore
to catch up on and there's no time for-

18:28.944 --> 18:30.486
What's up with that guy?

18:30.654 --> 18:32.113
Who?

18:32.489 --> 18:34.398
Guy by the window,
giving me stink eye.

18:34.700 --> 18:37.107
- You mean the cop?
- No, not the cop.

18:37.285 --> 18:38.484
The guy. He's right-

18:40.455 --> 18:42.531
- Well, now he's gone.
- Who's gone?

18:43.041 --> 18:44.915
- Can we get out?
- What's wrong with you?

18:45.085 --> 18:48.536
- Before I hit you.
- Okay. Jeez.

18:49.464 --> 18:52.086
<i>Library's
closing up soon. I'm almost done.</i>

18:52.259 --> 18:54.251
<i>- You find anything?
- Yeah. Way too much.</i>

18:54.428 --> 18:56.301
<i>Everyone on the planet believes
in UFOs.</i>

18:56.471 --> 18:58.760
<i>And they will not stop writing books
about it.</i>

18:58.932 --> 19:01.850
Yeah, well, at least books
have punctuation.

19:02.019 --> 19:04.688
All right, keep digging. We'll see
what you got when you get back.

19:09.401 --> 19:15.605
<i>Take your protein pills
and put your helmet on</i>

19:16.700 --> 19:18.278
<i>Ground Control to Major Tom</i>

19:18.452 --> 19:19.531
Oh, no.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.791
Not again.

19:30.881 --> 19:36.302
<i>Check ignition
And may God's love be with you</i>

19:46.980 --> 19:48.178
Nipples?

19:48.357 --> 19:51.144
<i>This is Ground Control to Major Tom</i>

19:51.318 --> 19:52.978
Bitch.

19:53.153 --> 19:57.103
<i>You've really made the grade</i>

19:57.991 --> 20:05.157
<i>And the papers want to know
Whose shirts you wear</i>

20:05.332 --> 20:06.447
Ha!

20:06.625 --> 20:09.958
<i>Now it's time
To leave the capsule if you dare</i>

20:16.551 --> 20:18.758
Ha, ha!

20:24.770 --> 20:26.430
See what?

20:26.605 --> 20:28.763
See what? See the blood.

20:28.941 --> 20:31.017
See all the blech.

20:32.819 --> 20:34.563
Sorry, man. I'm not seeing it.

20:34.738 --> 20:37.146
You don't see the ech? It's right here.

20:37.991 --> 20:40.363
Okay, let's go with you see it
and I don't.

20:41.286 --> 20:43.243
What the hell was it?

20:45.999 --> 20:47.707
It was a-

20:48.126 --> 20:50.914
A little naked lady, okay?

20:51.088 --> 20:52.333
It was-

20:52.756 --> 20:54.381
A what?

20:55.008 --> 21:00.679
It was a little, glowing,
hot naked lady...

21:00.847 --> 21:03.801
with nipples and-

21:05.143 --> 21:06.223
And she hit me.

21:08.730 --> 21:11.850
I'm not supposed to laugh, right?
Right. Okay. Sure. Um-

21:12.359 --> 21:17.566
So shot in the dark here,
but did this little lady have wings?

21:19.866 --> 21:22.702
- What the hell made you say that?
- She did, didn't she?

21:22.869 --> 21:25.277
- How did-?
- One of the theories I came across.

21:25.455 --> 21:28.492
It's actually what crazy crystal lady
was yammering about.

21:28.667 --> 21:30.161
What if these abductions...

21:30.335 --> 21:32.957
- have nothing to do with UFOs?
- What?

21:33.130 --> 21:35.751
Say these encounters
have been going on for centuries.

21:35.924 --> 21:38.961
Not with extraterrestrials,
with ultra-terrestrials.

21:39.136 --> 21:42.090
I mean, people nowadays say
space aliens or whatever.

21:42.264 --> 21:43.592
But they used to call them-

21:46.560 --> 21:47.722
- Smurfs?
- Fairies.

21:47.895 --> 21:51.180
- Fairies? Come on.
- There's a line between ETs and fairies.

21:51.356 --> 21:55.057
Glowing lights. Abductions. It's the same
UFO stuff under a different skin.

21:55.235 --> 21:57.358
You think the secret
with the UFOs is-

21:57.529 --> 22:00.613
You're the one who pizza-rolled
Tinker Bell. I'm doing the math.

22:00.782 --> 22:03.320
But this is good. This is a lead.

22:04.620 --> 22:06.114
A lead where?

22:06.288 --> 22:08.031
Fairies.

22:08.206 --> 22:12.667
Sprites and spriggans,
boggarts and brownies...

22:12.836 --> 22:14.912
the little people have many names.

22:15.881 --> 22:17.043
Well, that's, uh-

22:17.799 --> 22:21.050
That's her. That's the little-

22:22.054 --> 22:25.754
Anyway, I, uh,
I get that Tinker Bells are fairies.

22:26.350 --> 22:30.597
But what about the tiny Santa Claus
and the troll and-

22:30.771 --> 22:34.353
Oh, that's a garden gnome
and that's a large goblin and that-

22:34.524 --> 22:35.687
But they're all fairies?

22:36.109 --> 22:39.775
Yes, fairy comes in many shapes
and sizes.

22:40.656 --> 22:45.199
Magical, mischievous beings
from the realm next door.

22:45.369 --> 22:47.077
- The fairy realm?
- Mm-hm.

22:47.246 --> 22:48.788
So it's like another dimension?

22:48.956 --> 22:51.114
Another reality, yes.

22:51.875 --> 22:53.998
Only people who have been there...

22:54.169 --> 22:57.205
and returned to our world
can see the fairy here.

22:58.549 --> 23:00.126
Right. Um...

23:00.842 --> 23:02.882
Why are the fairies abducting people?

23:03.053 --> 23:07.265
Mm. There is much theory
and little fact.

23:07.432 --> 23:09.674
We know
they only take first-born sons.

23:10.727 --> 23:13.728
Just like Rumpelstiltskin did.

23:15.023 --> 23:18.688
Personally, I think they're taken
to Avalon...

23:18.860 --> 23:22.229
to service Oberon, king of the fairy.

23:26.868 --> 23:28.411
Dean?

23:28.787 --> 23:33.994
Did you service Oberon,
king of the fairies?

23:37.796 --> 23:38.994
- Marion.
- Hmm?

23:39.339 --> 23:40.881
Um...

23:41.633 --> 23:43.840
Let's say fairies are real, okay?

23:44.177 --> 23:45.969
- What can we do about them?
- Sorry?

23:46.388 --> 23:48.381
I mean, how can we-?

23:48.557 --> 23:51.392
- Interact with them?
- Yes, yes.

23:51.560 --> 23:52.722
Forcefully interact.

23:52.895 --> 23:57.556
Well, if you want to win a fairy's favor,
leave a bowl of fresh cream.

23:57.733 --> 23:59.357
They love cream.

23:59.985 --> 24:01.313
Okay.

24:01.486 --> 24:03.609
Uh, and more forcefully?

24:03.780 --> 24:07.529
Mm. Well, all fairy hate iron.

24:08.577 --> 24:11.946
And the dark fairy burn
when touched with silver.

24:13.206 --> 24:14.831
What else?

24:15.000 --> 24:18.914
Oh, you could spill sugar or salt
in front of them.

24:19.087 --> 24:25.291
No matter how powerful,
the fairy must stoop to count each grain.

24:25.469 --> 24:27.129
- Well, alrighty.
- Mm.

24:27.304 --> 24:29.629
That's-Wow. Heh.

24:29.806 --> 24:31.929
A lot to absorb.

24:32.559 --> 24:35.346
- Thank you.
- Oh, stay.

24:35.520 --> 24:36.931
Finish your tea.

24:43.487 --> 24:47.437
I gotta say, I love the feel.

24:47.616 --> 24:48.695
It's, uh, it's-

24:48.867 --> 24:51.536
It's like Sedona, Arizona,
crapped in here.

24:51.703 --> 24:53.826
- "Pewteriffic," is what it is.
- Ha-ha-ha.

24:54.331 --> 24:56.370
Pewteriffic.

25:01.380 --> 25:02.660
Do you have bigger cups?

25:02.839 --> 25:05.591
God. Is it on me?
I feel like I've got the crazy on me.

25:05.759 --> 25:06.838
No, you-

25:07.511 --> 25:09.966
You did sit in some glitter, though.

25:11.181 --> 25:13.138
Makes me wanna believe
in UFOs again.

25:13.684 --> 25:16.009
Doesn't give us a next move,
I'll grant you that.

25:16.436 --> 25:19.058
We can always put the call out
to Bobby.

25:20.566 --> 25:23.436
Hey. I'll be damned.

25:29.783 --> 25:31.941
Isn't that the watch guy?

25:32.160 --> 25:33.359
Huh.

25:34.705 --> 25:36.578
They love cream.

26:00.647 --> 26:04.265
All right, you stick with Half-n-Half.
I'm gonna go check out his store.

26:04.860 --> 26:07.315
And no hippie chicks.

27:44.418 --> 27:45.876
Yeah.

27:46.962 --> 27:49.168
Frigging full of Keeblers here.
Full of them.

27:49.339 --> 27:50.833
<i>- What?
- It's like the story...</i>

27:51.008 --> 27:53.712
with the shoe guy and all the elves.

27:53.886 --> 27:57.089
Hey, you think Brennan made a deal
with a bunch of fairies?

27:57.264 --> 27:59.303
<i>Let me get back to you.</i>

28:06.732 --> 28:07.894
So, Mr. Brennan...

28:09.318 --> 28:10.860
hello again.

28:11.028 --> 28:12.438
Leave me alone.

28:13.196 --> 28:15.734
Did I ever mention
how beautiful your work is?

28:17.409 --> 28:18.820
- What?
- The watches.

28:18.994 --> 28:21.152
Just stunning...

28:21.330 --> 28:25.374
but what I can't figure out is how
one man can put out that much product.

28:25.542 --> 28:27.582
I mean, hell, if I didn't know better...

28:27.753 --> 28:30.789
I'd say you have a bunch of elves
working for you.

28:35.010 --> 28:37.216
Except I do know better.

28:37.387 --> 28:40.092
And you have a bunch of elves
working for you.

28:40.766 --> 28:42.842
You're insane.

28:43.018 --> 28:47.929
So tell me, how does a father decide
to trade his son for a bunch of watches?

28:49.816 --> 28:54.028
I mean, I'm assuming you have a soul,
so, what's your excuse?

28:55.530 --> 28:57.986
You don't understand.

28:59.117 --> 29:00.362
It wasn't like that.

29:01.870 --> 29:03.779
Then how was it?

29:36.613 --> 29:41.109
I supported my family for 30 years
making those watches.

29:41.868 --> 29:44.360
It's the only thing I know how to do.

29:46.373 --> 29:48.081
But the Parkinson's-

29:48.584 --> 29:51.205
I was losing my hands.

29:51.545 --> 29:52.790
I was losing everything.

29:54.923 --> 29:57.758
My grandmother, she always used to say
that they were real.

29:58.677 --> 30:03.386
Told me all these stories when I was
a kid about how to summon them...

30:04.099 --> 30:05.890
how to get favors from them.

30:06.059 --> 30:08.633
So you learned how to work a spell.

30:08.812 --> 30:13.024
I mean, honestly,
I doubted it would even work.

30:13.942 --> 30:15.436
I was just desperate.

30:15.777 --> 30:17.320
But she'd left me this book.

30:18.405 --> 30:22.818
So I did the ceremony in my back office
two months ago.

30:24.703 --> 30:28.368
And this man appeared.

30:28.790 --> 30:30.582
Said he was a leprechaun.

30:31.919 --> 30:33.828
A leprechaun.

30:34.379 --> 30:38.792
I asked him just to cure my hands,
but he said he would do even better.

30:38.967 --> 30:43.214
He'd make me more successful
than I'd ever been.

30:43.388 --> 30:46.093
He told me he'd bring
a crew of workers...

30:46.266 --> 30:49.600
that I could save my business,
save my name.

30:49.770 --> 30:53.518
- In exchange for-?
- He just wanted a place for them to rest.

30:53.941 --> 30:57.392
To take of the fruit
and fat of the land.

30:58.278 --> 31:00.235
I said yes.

31:00.405 --> 31:01.520
I wasn't thinking.

31:01.698 --> 31:04.106
And the fruit and fat was-

31:06.870 --> 31:08.364
My first-born.

31:09.623 --> 31:12.114
And not just mine.
There's been others.

31:12.751 --> 31:14.293
They're not stopping.

31:14.670 --> 31:17.243
- They're not going to stop.
- There's gotta be a way...

31:17.422 --> 31:20.174
- to reverse the spell.
- There is.

31:20.342 --> 31:22.418
But the book is-

31:22.594 --> 31:24.254
It's in a safe in my shop.

31:24.972 --> 31:26.929
They won't let me near it.

31:28.308 --> 31:29.850
It's been a nightmare.

31:30.185 --> 31:33.103
- So you can see the fairies?
- Yes.

31:54.376 --> 31:56.119
Over there.

32:35.667 --> 32:36.912
Help, help!

32:37.085 --> 32:38.461
I got you, you little fairy.

32:39.004 --> 32:41.246
- Help.
- What do you want, you fairy?

32:41.423 --> 32:44.626
- Huh? Huh?
- Help. Get-

32:45.427 --> 32:46.590
Fairy.

32:47.262 --> 32:48.425
Daddy. Daddy.

32:49.723 --> 32:51.265
What's going on?

32:52.809 --> 32:55.016
- What the-?
- Oh, God, no.

32:58.232 --> 33:00.390
I'm just kidding.

33:00.567 --> 33:02.607
All right, don't worry, Brennan.

33:02.778 --> 33:03.892
We can do this.

33:04.071 --> 33:07.771
Just, uh-My brother and I are gonna
cover you while you reverse the ritual.

33:07.950 --> 33:09.064
Poor man.

33:09.243 --> 33:11.531
Dean, hey. Dude, what happened?

33:11.703 --> 33:13.162
Sam, Sam. Hey.

33:14.373 --> 33:16.531
- What am I supposed to do?
- Fight the fairies.

33:16.708 --> 33:18.037
You fight those fairies.

33:24.591 --> 33:26.216
Fight the fairies!

33:32.057 --> 33:38.427
I'm just trying to understand exactly
what kind of hate crime this even was.

33:38.605 --> 33:40.230
It wasn't a hate crime.

33:40.399 --> 33:44.266
I mean, if this gentlemen
were a full-sized homosexual...

33:44.444 --> 33:46.733
would that be okay with you?

33:46.905 --> 33:52.575
I don't hate any size person
or any size gay guy.

33:52.744 --> 33:54.654
Well, he's not gay, as it happens.

33:54.830 --> 33:57.499
But he is the district attorney
for Tipton County.

33:58.625 --> 34:01.116
Runs a tight ship, tell you what.

34:01.295 --> 34:04.331
It's nice to hear he's done well
for himself, considering his, uh-

34:06.592 --> 34:09.509
Considering
the tough economic times.

34:10.053 --> 34:11.761
Good for him.

34:12.472 --> 34:13.552
Son...

34:14.433 --> 34:17.350
you are all kinds of messed up.

34:41.543 --> 34:42.918
- Are they here?
- Yeah.

34:43.085 --> 34:46.004
But it's all right.
Cream hits them like tequila.

35:28.840 --> 35:30.465
You.

35:30.717 --> 35:32.176
You're the leprechaun?

35:32.344 --> 35:33.624
Indeed I am.

35:35.222 --> 35:39.385
Sorry about the mess,
but your friend here...

35:39.768 --> 35:40.966
went back on his deal.

35:41.144 --> 35:43.682
Well, you weren't very clear with him
on the terms.

35:43.855 --> 35:47.936
I told him there was a price.

35:48.902 --> 35:52.402
Once we come, we come to stay.

35:52.573 --> 35:56.273
So you take first-borns and then what?
You just sit back and watch...

35:56.451 --> 35:59.618
while they cover up the abductions
for you with all that UFO crap?

35:59.788 --> 36:02.326
Which you help encourage, naturally.

36:02.791 --> 36:04.416
Nice con.

36:04.585 --> 36:06.910
But your cover's blown now, Wayne.

36:07.337 --> 36:08.748
Blown?

36:08.922 --> 36:10.333
To whom?

36:10.507 --> 36:12.381
Brennan's dead.

36:12.551 --> 36:14.259
Your brother? Heh.

36:14.970 --> 36:17.176
He's marked.

36:17.347 --> 36:19.636
Been to the ranch.

36:19.975 --> 36:21.553
He's ours now.

36:22.728 --> 36:25.894
Yeah. Well, then there's me.

36:26.064 --> 36:27.475
You?

36:27.649 --> 36:29.975
But you can only see me if I let you.

36:32.946 --> 36:34.488
True.

36:35.365 --> 36:37.607
But you'll have
to get near me eventually...

36:37.784 --> 36:40.073
and I have very good reflexes.

36:40.245 --> 36:42.368
You're not like the rest of them,
are you?

36:43.832 --> 36:47.283
- Nope.
- No, I could see that right off.

36:49.254 --> 36:54.212
You're missing a certain piece,
right in the center, ain't you?

36:55.302 --> 36:56.844
Says who?

36:57.012 --> 37:00.179
We fairyfolk are all about energy...

37:00.599 --> 37:03.849
and the human soul gives off
a certain...

37:04.937 --> 37:06.597
perfume.

37:06.772 --> 37:09.892
Your soul is far away...

37:10.067 --> 37:12.024
but not completely out of reach.

37:12.194 --> 37:14.649
- That so?
- Sam.

37:15.739 --> 37:18.859
I can get it back for you, for a price.

37:21.203 --> 37:22.780
That's adorable.

37:22.955 --> 37:25.161
It's locked in a box with the devil.

37:25.332 --> 37:26.910
Your devil. Not mine.

37:27.084 --> 37:30.666
There's no freaking way a leprechaun
can do what angels cannot.

37:30.837 --> 37:33.589
Angels. Oh, please.

37:33.757 --> 37:36.213
I'm talking about real magic, sonny.

37:36.385 --> 37:38.294
From my side of the fence.

37:39.137 --> 37:41.889
Got a way of getting in back doors.

37:44.142 --> 37:45.305
So you're my Blue Fairy?

37:46.436 --> 37:48.394
You can make me a real boy again?

37:49.565 --> 37:52.352
When you wish upon a star.

37:55.028 --> 37:56.523
Yeah.

37:57.573 --> 37:59.482
I got a wish.

38:00.075 --> 38:01.617
Iron.

38:02.661 --> 38:04.120
Painful...

38:05.372 --> 38:06.617
but not a deal-breaker.

39:07.100 --> 39:08.476
Come on, lad.

39:08.644 --> 39:10.885
You've already taken your best shot.

39:13.982 --> 39:15.642
You're right.

39:17.194 --> 39:18.392
I'm done shooting.

39:18.946 --> 39:21.271
So do me a favor...

39:22.324 --> 39:23.652
and count this.

39:25.452 --> 39:27.195
Oh, no.

39:31.959 --> 39:33.501
Why didn't I do that earlier?

39:38.257 --> 39:39.336
One...

39:40.842 --> 39:43.049
Three, you ass.

39:45.138 --> 39:46.597
Five, damn it...

39:47.891 --> 39:49.302
six-

40:20.462 --> 40:22.087
So...

40:23.340 --> 40:24.882
here's to the tiniest DA.

40:25.050 --> 40:26.877
Thanks for dropping the charges.

40:29.179 --> 40:31.219
Little big man.

40:35.227 --> 40:37.266
I was wondering something.

40:37.688 --> 40:39.016
Yeah?

40:39.189 --> 40:43.898
You think Lucky Charms really
could have returned soul to sender?

40:44.069 --> 40:46.987
Come on. That's crazy to think.

40:47.155 --> 40:50.359
- He did talk a good game, though.
- Hmm.

40:51.410 --> 40:53.153
You said no.

40:53.328 --> 40:54.953
Why?

40:56.707 --> 41:00.040
It was a deal.
When's a deal ever been a good thing?

41:03.213 --> 41:06.250
I'm just trying to figure out
how it works in there.

41:07.259 --> 41:10.176
Dude, I do still have all my brain cells.

41:10.345 --> 41:12.718
If anything,
my brain works better now.

41:14.266 --> 41:16.424
I'm making sure
that's where your head's at.

41:16.602 --> 41:20.267
You know, that you're not having second
thoughts about getting your soul back.

41:20.439 --> 41:22.016
Oh.

41:25.652 --> 41:26.732
You're not, are you?

41:28.780 --> 41:30.323
No. Heh.
