00:06.906 --> 00:09.875
Are you sure you wanna start
another restaurant?

00:09.877 --> 00:12.144
A little late to back out now.

00:13.713 --> 00:16.048
<i>[narrator] A couple
starting a new adventure...</i>

00:16.050 --> 00:17.916
Congratulations, Chef Masson.

00:17.918 --> 00:20.452
This restaurant
is definitely my dream.

00:20.454 --> 00:24.289
<i>[narrator] ...find themselves
in the crosshair of eerie</i>

00:24.291 --> 00:30.129
<i>and unexplained events that
threaten to force them out.</i>

00:30.997 --> 00:33.032
I can't take this anymore.

00:34.467 --> 00:37.102
[screaming]

00:37.871 --> 00:41.673
<i>[narrator] In this world,
there is real evil.</i>

00:41.675 --> 00:45.044
<i>[girl] Someone's in my room.</i>

00:45.046 --> 00:47.980
<i>[narrator] It lurks
in the darkest shadows.</i>

00:50.984 --> 00:55.120
<i>Between what we see
and the things we fear,</i>

00:56.156 --> 00:57.890
<i>there are doors.</i>

00:57.892 --> 00:59.291
<i>When they are opened...</i>

01:01.494 --> 01:05.164
<i>nightmares become reality.</i>

01:16.743 --> 01:19.778
<i>[narrator] Just north of
Myrtle Beach, South Carolina,</i>

01:19.780 --> 01:22.714
<i>sits a sleepy waterfront
fishing village</i>

01:22.716 --> 01:25.050
<i>known as Little River.</i>

01:27.720 --> 01:30.089
Ah! Look at how beautiful
the pink is.

01:30.091 --> 01:32.124
I don't think
I wanna touch the pink.

01:32.126 --> 01:34.493
<i>[narrator] It's here
that French Chef Eric Masson</i>

01:34.495 --> 01:36.528
<i>and his wife Kim</i>

01:36.530 --> 01:40.999
<i>buy a restaurant already
established as the Brentwood.</i>

01:41.001 --> 01:43.402
We can put three tables there.
We can plant flowers here.

01:43.404 --> 01:44.837
Easter brunch
under the cherry tree.

01:44.839 --> 01:47.840
I mean, just walking up to
the house, it's just magnificent.

01:47.842 --> 01:50.776
<i>It's a beautiful
Victorian house,</i>

01:50.778 --> 01:52.411
<i>and I couldn't wait
to get inside.</i>

01:52.846 --> 01:54.813
<i>[narrator] Built in 1910,</i>

01:54.815 --> 01:58.117
<i>the once grand Victorian
mansion was converted</i>

01:58.119 --> 02:01.854
<i>into a restaurant by
the previous owners in 1994.</i>

02:01.856 --> 02:04.022
Let's go. Let's do it.

02:04.824 --> 02:07.726
We decided that we needed
to move out of New York,

02:07.728 --> 02:09.828
<i>have a new adventure.</i>

02:09.830 --> 02:11.797
<i>We just wanted to do fine dining</i>

02:11.799 --> 02:15.134
<i>and just focus
on Eric's French cuisine.</i>

02:15.136 --> 02:17.569
Are you sure you wanna start
another restaurant?

02:17.571 --> 02:19.238
[chuckling]

02:19.240 --> 02:21.473
- It's a little too late to back out now.
- Yeah.

02:23.209 --> 02:24.042
[speaks French]

02:24.044 --> 02:26.945
- After you.
- All right. Here we go.

02:26.947 --> 02:30.082
[tense music playing]

02:35.088 --> 02:36.755
[Eric] It's a nice space, huh?

02:36.757 --> 02:37.789
Yeah.

02:37.791 --> 02:40.392
[Eric] It'll fit about
40-50 people down here.

02:41.628 --> 02:44.029
It's good, I like the light
fixtures. We can keep that.

02:44.031 --> 02:46.865
You know, we can
probably use the tables. Huh?

02:46.867 --> 02:49.434
They're solid.
They're mismatched, but, uh...

02:49.436 --> 02:51.203
- [knocking]
- Yeah.

02:51.205 --> 02:53.172
Put a few tablecloths on and...

02:53.174 --> 02:54.706
[chuckling]

02:54.708 --> 02:56.108
[Kim] Interesting.

02:56.110 --> 02:57.809
- [bell rings]
- Table for one?

02:57.811 --> 02:59.444
[laughing]

02:59.446 --> 03:04.316
We were a little intrigued
of the amount of angels

03:04.318 --> 03:06.485
<i>that was, you know,
in the restaurant.</i>

03:09.455 --> 03:16.028
I guess the previous owners,
they liked angels... a lot.

03:17.897 --> 03:18.697
You think?

03:18.699 --> 03:20.465
It seemed a little strange

03:20.467 --> 03:23.302
<i>that there are just so many
angels and no other decor.</i>

03:26.606 --> 03:30.475
Congratulations, Chef Masson.
We did it.

03:30.477 --> 03:32.978
<i>Eric looked at me
and he said, "Wow.</i>

03:32.980 --> 03:34.947
<i>This is my dream."</i>

03:37.984 --> 03:41.153
I said, "Yes, I know,
this house fits

03:41.155 --> 03:42.854
the type of food
that you will cook."

03:42.856 --> 03:45.157
Let's go to the kitchen!

03:45.159 --> 03:48.227
The achievement of a chef
is to own a restaurant.

03:49.996 --> 03:52.264
<i>Owning this restaurant
is definitely my dream.</i>

03:54.734 --> 03:56.201
[shattering]

03:57.537 --> 04:01.073
[tense music playing]

04:05.011 --> 04:07.646
<i>[Eric] We kept the same name,
and the name was established</i>

04:07.648 --> 04:09.848
<i>Brentwood Restaurant.</i>

04:09.850 --> 04:12.684
My job at the restaurant
was basically everything,

04:12.686 --> 04:13.919
<i>as well as Eric's.</i>

04:13.921 --> 04:15.654
- How is everything?
- Oh.

04:15.656 --> 04:16.922
So far so good.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.123
All right. Super.
So glad to hear it.

04:18.125 --> 04:19.458
Save room for the desert.

04:19.460 --> 04:20.726
<i>He did most of the cooking.</i>

04:20.728 --> 04:22.628
<i>He's the back of the house,
I'm front of the house.</i>

04:22.630 --> 04:24.263
<i>But we both share everything.</i>

04:24.265 --> 04:26.231
Good evening, folks.
Hello. Hello.

04:26.233 --> 04:27.466
My name is Eric.

04:27.468 --> 04:29.368
Your mussels.

04:31.604 --> 04:33.672
<i>[Kim] Kristen worked
with us for quite a while.</i>

04:33.674 --> 04:35.073
You're welcome.
Carrot cake for you.

04:35.075 --> 04:36.875
Anything else
I can get you guys?

04:36.877 --> 04:38.744
We're great.
Thank you so much.

04:38.746 --> 04:41.446
When I first got there, I was
mainly working downstairs

04:41.448 --> 04:42.614
in our downstairs area.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.416
<i>It would be high-stress
at times.</i>

04:44.418 --> 04:47.552
<i>You would be, you know,
making a martini, flipping a drink,</i>

04:47.554 --> 04:50.422
<i>running over taking an order.
But it was... it was great.</i>

04:51.991 --> 04:53.725
<i>[narrator] But shortly
after opening,</i>

04:53.727 --> 04:57.462
<i>Kim and Eric experience
something odd.</i>

04:58.998 --> 05:01.667
So we were redoing the
decoration of the restaurant.

05:01.669 --> 05:04.870
<i>[Kim] One of our bartenders
at the time, he said,</i>

05:04.872 --> 05:07.172
"Is there any way
we could move that picture?

05:07.174 --> 05:08.707
<i>It's just so...</i>

05:08.709 --> 05:10.442
<i>you know, I feel like
they're looking at me</i>

05:10.444 --> 05:12.744
<i>when I'm in the bathroom,"
you know?</i>

05:12.746 --> 05:14.746
<i>And I said, "Sure, why not?"</i>

05:14.748 --> 05:16.014
<i>You know?
"It's just a picture."</i>

05:16.016 --> 05:19.351
It's like they're watching you,
right? Wherever you stand.

05:19.353 --> 05:21.987
I mean, all I had to do
is just to pick up,

05:21.989 --> 05:23.255
<i>you know, the frame.</i>

05:23.257 --> 05:25.190
[glass shattering]

05:25.192 --> 05:29.127
<i>But the second I did that,
then I heard this crash.</i>

05:33.399 --> 05:34.666
<i>We found this glass,</i>

05:34.668 --> 05:39.071
<i>it was actually a champagne
flute, and it was broken.</i>

05:39.073 --> 05:42.374
<i>Million pieces on the floor.
There was nobody upstairs.</i>

05:44.177 --> 05:47.312
How did that glass get...
[laughs]

05:48.147 --> 05:49.881
That makes no sense.

05:49.883 --> 05:52.818
If it fell, it would fall
behind the bar.

05:52.820 --> 05:55.387
Yeah, not...
not all the way over there.

05:57.590 --> 06:00.492
<i>[Kim] This glass came
from the bar.</i>

06:00.494 --> 06:02.861
<i>The bar rack, which actually
has a little stopper</i>

06:02.863 --> 06:06.031
<i>at the end, so I don't know
how that actually got out.</i>

06:06.033 --> 06:08.700
<i>[Eric] It was so far
from the bar.</i>

06:08.702 --> 06:11.770
And so, I look at this
and I'm like...

06:11.772 --> 06:14.039
I'm trying to figure out,
okay, so it fell from the rack,

06:14.041 --> 06:16.108
it bounced on the bar... okay.

06:16.110 --> 06:17.809
<i>But then it fell 15 foot away.</i>

06:17.811 --> 06:19.578
<i>So it just didn't add up.</i>

06:19.580 --> 06:25.016
<i>It-- it almost seems like
it was thrown from the bar.</i>

06:25.018 --> 06:27.452
There's no way it landed here
without being thrown.

06:27.454 --> 06:29.388
We're the only ones here.

06:30.590 --> 06:32.224
I don't know. I guess it fell.

06:33.192 --> 06:36.094
What I do know is
I'm gonna clean it up.

06:37.296 --> 06:40.265
<i>[Kim] It smashed so hard,
and we were all just trying</i>

06:40.267 --> 06:41.566
<i>to figure out how that happened.</i>

06:41.568 --> 06:43.135
That's not normal.

06:49.609 --> 06:53.378
<i>[narrator] As the weeks go by,
the Brentwood remains busy.</i>

06:56.716 --> 07:00.118
<i>Kristen is promoted
to run the bar upstairs.</i>

07:01.854 --> 07:04.423
I ended up eventually
pretty much taking over

07:04.425 --> 07:07.459
the upstairs by myself for the
most part when I would work.

07:10.163 --> 07:14.166
<i>It was Eric and I who would
be the last to leave.</i>

07:14.168 --> 07:15.233
<i>Because I was upstairs,</i>

07:15.235 --> 07:17.302
<i>it would be the last
place we'd close.</i>

07:29.015 --> 07:30.248
[crashing]

07:45.698 --> 07:47.766
[saltshaker clatters]

07:47.768 --> 07:50.435
<i>[Kristen] All of a sudden,
the saltshaker shot out</i>

07:50.437 --> 07:52.204
and it rolled on the floor.

07:53.172 --> 07:57.042
[eerie music playing]

08:08.821 --> 08:10.055
Hello?

08:24.971 --> 08:26.071
[Kristen gasps]

08:29.242 --> 08:30.442
Hello?

08:32.278 --> 08:33.979
Who's there?

08:36.716 --> 08:38.850
Who's there?

08:38.852 --> 08:42.287
That was probably the fastest
I've ever left the Brentwood.

08:45.791 --> 08:49.794
Because there was no
explanation for how something

08:49.796 --> 08:52.230
could've been thrown towards me.

08:52.232 --> 08:53.965
<i>There was nobody there.</i>

08:59.972 --> 09:03.675
<i>[narrator] As the nights pass,
Kristen tells no one</i>

09:03.677 --> 09:06.978
<i>about what happened
in the upstairs bar.</i>

09:11.784 --> 09:14.019
<i>[Eric] I was
in the bathroom upstairs,</i>

09:14.453 --> 09:16.288
and I just was washing my hands.

09:17.023 --> 09:18.290
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

09:18.292 --> 09:20.225
Good evening, <i>madame, monsieur.</i>

[door slams]

09:29.335 --> 09:31.002
<i>I froze...</i>

09:35.207 --> 09:39.177
<i>and I was just scared.</i>

09:42.715 --> 09:44.082
I don't scare that easy.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.718
I'm a... a French chef.

<i>and things like that.</i>

[lady sighs]

09:52.859 --> 09:55.694
<i>Suddenly, I hear this loud sigh.</i>

<i>It was so loud,
and it was so clear,</i>

09:57.998 --> 09:59.898
<i>and it was inches from my face.</i>

09:59.900 --> 10:02.100
<i>It was just
right behind the door.</i>

10:02.102 --> 10:04.302

10:34.967 --> 10:37.936
I came out
and there was nothing there.

And then I was like,
"Okay, oh, come on."

<i>You know?
I was like, "All right."</i>

10:42.676 --> 10:45.076

Yeah, yeah, everything's okay.

10:55.856 --> 10:57.455
Yeah.

10:57.457 --> 11:00.659
I was scared. I felt like
something was watching,

11:00.661 --> 11:01.926
something was close.

11:01.928 --> 11:05.463
I'll be home soon, okay?
I'm just closing up.

11:05.465 --> 11:06.931
<i>[Kim] Okay.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.436
<i>I didn't even talk

11:11.438 --> 11:15.440

11:15.442 --> 11:17.676
It was just water in the pipe.

11:17.678 --> 11:18.943
There was nothing into it.

11:39.198 --> 11:40.098
<i>[Kim] I'm a morning person,</i>

I-- I... really don't know
how else to describe it.

I never believed
in any haunting or any,

13:18.731 --> 13:19.998
you know, thing.

13:20.466 --> 13:21.766
<i>My thinking is, like,</i>

13:21.768 --> 13:23.468
<i>"Well, if the ghost
really exists,</i>

13:23.470 --> 13:26.938
<i>then I think, by now, we
should-- we should know about it."</i>

13:26.940 --> 13:29.974
I didn't tell you because I
figured it was just the plumbing.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.843
Because if
it wasn't the plumbing--

13:31.845 --> 13:34.078
Okay, well, do you think
our house is haunted?

13:34.080 --> 13:35.647
[laughs] No!

13:35.649 --> 13:37.849
No. I mean,
I don't know what it is,

13:37.851 --> 13:40.084
but I don't think it's a ghost.

13:40.086 --> 13:41.252
[laughs]

13:42.121 --> 13:42.987
Yeah.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.589
- [laughs] Yeah-- I know.
- Hmm?

13:44.591 --> 13:45.890
Maybe you're right.

13:45.892 --> 13:48.860
"Maybe"? Babe, come on.
Of course I'm right.

13:48.862 --> 13:50.461
Huh? Huh?

13:50.463 --> 13:51.663
Back to work, huh?

13:51.665 --> 13:53.364
[chuckles] Yeah.

13:53.366 --> 13:55.133
- Right behind you. Yes.
- Yeah?

13:55.167 --> 13:56.434
Go.

14:12.919 --> 14:15.019
<i>[Kim] We have a table
at the restaurant,</i>

14:15.021 --> 14:16.754
and it's a table
near the window.

14:20.894 --> 14:22.293

you have any questions.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.109

What...

14:51.891 --> 14:54.225
How did that happen? I--

14:55.060 --> 14:57.228
I will get this cleaned up.

14:58.998 --> 15:00.064
Ow, God.

15:00.066 --> 15:02.133
I knew the place was haunted.

15:02.135 --> 15:04.168
I just never thought
I'd see it for myself.

15:04.170 --> 15:05.036
What?

15:05.038 --> 15:06.638
Costumers were like, "Oh.

15:06.640 --> 15:08.873
You didn't know this place
has a ghost?"

15:08.875 --> 15:12.143
I'm surprised the people you
bought it from didn't tell you.

15:14.980 --> 15:16.314
That would explain the angels.

15:17.483 --> 15:18.683
Hmm?

15:18.685 --> 15:22.954
[chuckles] No, sorry.
They didn't say anything.

18:36.850 --> 18:38.516
We just needed to find out

19:08.948 --> 19:11.082
<i>and trying to find out
some history.</i>

19:12.751 --> 19:16.787
I found out that
the house was built in 1910,

19:16.789 --> 19:18.990
<i>finished in 1912.</i>

19:19.925 --> 19:25.096

19:38.745 --> 19:41.846
Well, I see you found
Essie and Clarence.

19:41.848 --> 19:45.082
Yeah, do you know
anything about them?

19:45.084 --> 19:48.119
As a matter of fact, I do.

19:49.154 --> 19:53.024
I grew up here,
and Essie McCorsley,

19:53.026 --> 19:56.027
she was quite a lady.

19:56.895 --> 20:00.364
They loved their house,
your restaurant.

20:00.966 --> 20:04.635
Unfortunately,
Clarence died in his 50s,

20:04.637 --> 20:08.806
leaving Essie the house
that she loved so much.

20:08.808 --> 20:14.845
In fact, she believed that
Clarence's spirit was there.

20:14.847 --> 20:18.482
So when someone wanted to buy
the land the house was on,

20:18.484 --> 20:20.651
she had it moved.

20:20.653 --> 20:23.454
Brick by brick,
across the street.

20:24.856 --> 20:27.024
<i>[Kim] I think
Clarence McCorsley and Essie</i>

20:27.026 --> 20:29.727
just built this beautiful house

20:29.729 --> 20:32.630
with all the love that they
shared for each other.

20:32.632 --> 20:36.467
After Clarence died,
to make money,

20:36.469 --> 20:38.936
she had it turned into
a bed and breakfast

20:38.938 --> 20:42.106
for the local fishermen
that came through.

20:42.108 --> 20:44.575
<i>[Kim] Essie really
enjoyed talking to them,</i>

20:44.577 --> 20:45.776
<i>getting to know them.</i>

20:45.778 --> 20:50.715
She was so polite that if one
of her guests was spending

20:50.717 --> 20:55.653
too much time in the only
bathroom that was upstairs,

20:55.655 --> 21:00.992
she was known to stand
outside the door and sigh.

21:02.794 --> 21:07.665
This may sound crazy,
but I think my husband and I

21:07.667 --> 21:09.166
have heard that sigh.

21:12.938 --> 21:15.172
That doesn't sound crazy at all.

21:15.974 --> 21:18.309
Essie loved that house so much.

21:18.944 --> 21:21.045
It's not hard at all to believe

21:21.047 --> 21:23.047
that she's still there.

21:24.850 --> 21:28.953
Well... I'll let you get
back to your research.

21:29.521 --> 21:31.088
Thank you.

21:33.425 --> 21:36.794
It's just crazy to get the
explanation about what happened,

21:36.796 --> 21:40.598
and to hear it from somebody
that has no knowledge at all

21:40.600 --> 21:43.000
about what, you know,
I had experienced.

21:43.602 --> 21:45.903
<i>It's just like everything
came together.</i>

<i>[narrator] The Massons now

<i>And as the days go by,</i>

22:08.528 --> 22:14.699
<i>they can feel the ghostly

22:14.701 --> 22:17.001
<i>[Kim] When I would come into the

<i>I go right by the dishwasher,</i>

24:06.813 --> 24:07.812

all those locks

24:18.858 --> 24:21.759

<i>is because, when that

<i>it's hot, scalding water.</i>

the restaurant in Stephen's hands,</i>

27:16.202 --> 27:20.304
<i>hoping his team's presence
won't make matters worse.</i>

27:20.306 --> 27:22.106
<i>[Stephen] It was time
for me to begin the setup,</i>

27:22.108 --> 27:25.309
<i>so we went first thing
looked at the surveillance.</i>

27:25.311 --> 27:27.177
I got your camera, you want it?

27:28.179 --> 27:29.212
Yeah.

27:29.214 --> 27:31.081
<i>[Stephen] We brought
night vision cameras,</i>

27:31.083 --> 27:33.917
<i>we brought walkie-talkies to
communicate with each other</i>

27:33.919 --> 27:36.053
<i>throughout the building.</i>

27:36.055 --> 27:39.423
Let me check. Let me get
these on the same channel.

27:40.792 --> 27:44.294
Okay, that'll work. Christina,
you can have that one.

27:47.966 --> 27:50.801
<i>[narrator] Stephen and his
team plan to split up</i>

27:50.803 --> 27:52.102
<i>and go room by room</i>

27:52.104 --> 27:54.338
<i>in an attempt
to capture the ghosts.</i>

27:54.839 --> 27:57.174
Looking good.

27:57.176 --> 27:59.977
<i>They have no idea
what waits for them...</i>

27:59.979 --> 28:02.112
- Ready?
- Let's go.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.282
<i>in the dark.</i>

28:11.956 --> 28:13.857
<i>[narrator] Stephen Lancaster
and his team</i>

28:13.859 --> 28:16.527
<i>of paranormal investigators</i>

28:16.529 --> 28:19.930
<i>are hell-bent on capturing
evidence that proves</i>

28:19.932 --> 28:24.668
<i>or disproves the Brentwood
restaurant is haunted.</i>

28:24.670 --> 28:27.071
<i>[Stephen] There's
something in the air.</i>

28:27.839 --> 28:30.307
<i>The best way to describe it,
it was thick.</i>

28:31.576 --> 28:33.410
It almost made it
hard to breathe.

28:42.887 --> 28:45.823
[Christina] We're in
the kitchen of the Brentwood,

28:45.825 --> 28:50.027
it's in here Eric had the
dishwasher turn on by itself.

28:50.029 --> 28:53.163
[tense music playing]

29:03.775 --> 29:05.008
[clattering]

29:06.911 --> 29:08.645
What the hell was that?

29:08.647 --> 29:12.483
<i>[Christina] All of a sudden,
you hear something hit the floor.</i>

29:12.485 --> 29:15.252
<i>[Stephen] Chef Eric's
surveillance captured that.</i>

29:16.588 --> 29:20.524
And I immediately turn around
and there is a plastic cup

29:20.526 --> 29:22.459
<i>in the middle of the floor
spinning.</i>

29:22.461 --> 29:25.295
So we were already on edge
right from the beginning.

29:28.800 --> 29:32.970
That is crazy.
That cup had lift.

29:33.438 --> 29:35.305
That was not just gravity.

29:35.307 --> 29:38.609
Come on, I wanna check
out the bar area next.

29:38.611 --> 29:41.111
- Okay.
- That was insane.

29:42.447 --> 29:44.615
So, you know, we started
thinking more and more about

29:44.617 --> 29:46.083
what Chef Eric had said.

29:46.085 --> 29:48.752
Eric and Kim said they've had
a lot of activity

29:48.754 --> 29:50.187
happen in the bathroom

29:50.822 --> 29:53.624
where this picture
hangs on the wall.

29:53.626 --> 29:55.959
<i>They've also heard a sighing</i>

29:55.961 --> 29:58.962
<i>that they think is
the original owner, Essie.</i>

30:00.765 --> 30:04.134
[static from device]

30:08.072 --> 30:10.874
Nothing electrical around,
the table was wooden.

30:10.876 --> 30:12.776
<i>Wood isn't a conductor.</i>

30:12.778 --> 30:16.547
<i>And this thing is giving off
an electromagnetic field.</i>

30:16.549 --> 30:18.682
<i>[narrator] It's a common
paranormal belief</i>

30:18.684 --> 30:22.186
<i>that spirits require
energy to thrive.</i>

30:22.921 --> 30:25.255
This frame is giving off
so much energy,

30:25.990 --> 30:27.357
it's almost like it's alive.

30:29.894 --> 30:31.461
[sighing]

30:32.931 --> 30:34.264
Something's over there,
I can feel it.

30:34.933 --> 30:37.267
[static intensifies]

30:39.470 --> 30:44.074
[record player starts]

30:44.076 --> 30:45.843
<i>[Stephen] There was
an old record player.</i>

30:45.845 --> 30:47.878
<i>It starts playing by itself.</i>

30:47.880 --> 30:51.014
<i>It was like straight out
of a horror movie.</i>

30:51.016 --> 30:53.250
I'm speaking to whomever's
in this room.

30:54.185 --> 30:56.320
Can you tell us your name?

30:57.355 --> 30:58.388
What is your name?

30:59.023 --> 31:00.190
[indistinct voice]

31:00.192 --> 31:01.258
Did you hear that?

31:01.260 --> 31:03.093
[whispering] Frank?

31:03.095 --> 31:05.028
Is your name Frank?

31:06.764 --> 31:08.966
[indistinct whispers]

31:09.868 --> 31:12.035
<i>[Christina] I can tell you
the feeling that I got,</i>

31:12.037 --> 31:15.806
it was stronger than
anything I had ever felt,

31:15.808 --> 31:18.008
and it was almost as
if my skin were crawling.

31:18.010 --> 31:21.011
[tense music playing]

31:28.686 --> 31:31.321
[sobbing]

31:41.933 --> 31:43.567
<i>[Stephen] I believe
the entity in there was</i>

31:43.569 --> 31:45.869
<i>trying to intimidate
me and my crew</i>

31:45.871 --> 31:47.804
<i>because Chef and Kim
were already intimidated</i>

31:47.806 --> 31:50.207
<i>with what was
happening in that place.</i>

31:50.209 --> 31:54.878
So if I came to them and said,
"Yes, this is dark, this is scary,

31:54.880 --> 31:57.681
this is intimidating,"
he's getting what he wants.

31:57.683 --> 31:59.683
He didn't want me
to go back to them and say,

31:59.685 --> 32:02.019
"You've got nothing
to worry about."

32:03.054 --> 32:04.588

<i>Stephen and Eddie
attempt to make contact.</i>

32:11.397 --> 32:13.597
My other investigator
stops me and says,

32:13.599 --> 32:16.767
<i>"You'll never believe this,
but my camera just died.</i>

32:16.769 --> 32:20.771
<i>I just put a new battery
on it, my camera just died."</i>

32:20.773 --> 32:22.940
<i>No sooner did he tell me
his battery died,</i>

32:22.942 --> 32:24.007
<i>my own camera died.</i>

32:24.009 --> 32:26.310
There is something here.

32:27.645 --> 32:30.080
It's draining the energy
from the batteries.

32:31.149 --> 32:33.917
Go get some new batteries,
they're charging in the kitchen,

32:33.919 --> 32:35.819
and put an
extra one in your pocket.

32:35.821 --> 32:37.054
Got it.

32:37.755 --> 32:40.958
It is believed in the
paranormal research community

32:40.960 --> 32:44.995
<i>that a spirit must
have energy to do anything.</i>

32:48.833 --> 32:50.500
<i>There were no words,
there were no sounds,</i>

32:50.502 --> 32:52.436
<i>there were no footsteps.</i>

32:52.438 --> 32:57.007
You could not see any eyes, just
everything about him was black.

32:57.675 --> 32:59.275
<i>I just couldn't believe it.</i>

32:59.277 --> 33:03.280
<i>That was the first time in my life I
had ever seen anything like that.</i>

33:08.686 --> 33:11.989
Eddie. Eddie.

33:16.928 --> 33:20.864
<i>Shortly after seeing the solid
black shadow entity,</i>

33:20.866 --> 33:26.203
I watched a face come out of
this mirror and go back in.

33:29.073 --> 33:33.176
<i>You can tell it's male, and you
can actually see eyes this time.</i>

33:33.178 --> 33:37.247
<i>So I lift up my camera and I
just start taking pictures.</i>

33:37.249 --> 33:38.849
<i>It's not afraid to throw
things out at you,</i>

33:38.851 --> 33:40.484
<i>it's not afraid to show itself.</i>

33:43.021 --> 33:45.155
What else could it possibly do?

33:45.923 --> 33:47.958
- [Christina screams]
- Christina!

33:50.795 --> 33:53.063
Christina. Christina?

33:54.866 --> 33:55.932
Oh, my gosh!

33:55.934 --> 33:58.201
See if you can pull it
towards you.

33:59.637 --> 34:02.906
Stephen, I can't get
out of the bathroom!

34:02.908 --> 34:06.076
What's going on?
I'm pulling as hard as I can.

34:06.078 --> 34:10.047
Christina, stand back. I'm
gonna try to kick the door in.

34:10.049 --> 34:12.449
Okay. Be careful.

34:12.451 --> 34:14.451
<i>[Stephen] Christina
was trapped in there.</i>

34:15.019 --> 34:16.420
Stephen.

34:17.789 --> 34:18.989
[glass shattering]

34:25.063 --> 34:27.798
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

34:27.800 --> 34:29.933
- What happened?
- [shuddering]

34:29.935 --> 34:31.935
Stephen, there was something
in here with me.

34:31.937 --> 34:34.137
I don't know
if it was Frank or what,

34:34.139 --> 34:35.972
- it was definitely dark.
- Did it hurt you?

34:35.974 --> 34:38.041
No, that's the crazy part.

34:38.043 --> 34:40.043
Essie and Clarence's picture
fell from the wall,

34:40.045 --> 34:43.547
it was almost like they were trying to
warn me or protect me from something--

34:43.549 --> 34:47.284
Okay. That's it.
We're calling it a night.

34:50.988 --> 34:53.757
<i>[narrator] The next morning,
Stephen prepares to show</i>

34:53.759 --> 34:57.661
<i>Eric and Kim the evidence
he captured during the night.</i>

34:57.663 --> 34:59.963
<i>[Stephen] It goes
without saying for me,</i>

34:59.965 --> 35:04.201
<i>the Brentwood Wine Bistro
is one of a kind.</i>

35:04.203 --> 35:06.937
It's the most haunted
location I've ever been in,

35:06.939 --> 35:08.438
and I've been in a lot.

35:09.574 --> 35:11.007
[Christina]
<i>There was no denying,</i>

35:11.009 --> 35:13.810
<i>it was not air-conditioner
vents, it was not poor plumbing.</i>

35:13.812 --> 35:16.713
This place was full of activity.

35:16.715 --> 35:18.915
And it was full of activity
from the other side.

35:18.917 --> 35:21.017
- Good morning.
- [Eric] Good morning.

35:21.019 --> 35:24.221
Hey, good morning.
I gotta show you this.

35:25.022 --> 35:27.958
There is definitely
something here.

35:30.561 --> 35:32.929
So, in this video
I'm wanna show you,

35:32.931 --> 35:35.098
we got this off of
your security camera, watch.

35:35.100 --> 35:36.466
[tense music playing]

35:46.444 --> 35:49.846
Unbelievable, and that's not it.

35:49.848 --> 35:53.650
I saw the shadow man on the
stairs and in the mirror.

35:53.652 --> 35:56.086
Let me show you those pictures.

35:56.088 --> 36:01.291
This is the outline of him at
the bottom of the stairs.

36:01.592 --> 36:04.094
- Yeah. Right there.
- Oh.

36:05.163 --> 36:09.099
Okay, here we go. This is him
in the mirror on a wide shot.

36:09.734 --> 36:11.201
Right there.

36:11.969 --> 36:13.703
You can see the outline
of his face.

36:13.705 --> 36:15.071
Is that who you saw?

36:15.073 --> 36:17.374
- Yeah.
- Here, let me blow it up.

36:19.277 --> 36:21.011
There you go.

36:21.546 --> 36:22.946
That's him.

36:22.948 --> 36:25.849
You can actually see
a face in the mirror.

36:25.883 --> 36:26.917
It's just incredible.

36:26.919 --> 36:29.953
<i>[Stephen] The stuff
I saw that night,</i>

36:29.955 --> 36:33.523
and this is no lie,
kept me awake for three days.

36:33.525 --> 36:36.860
<i>That was the first time
I saw a full-bodied,</i>

36:36.862 --> 36:40.096
<i>solid black silhouette
of a man in front of me.</i>

36:40.898 --> 36:42.465
[Eric]
<i>He got lots of material.</i>

36:42.467 --> 36:44.334
<i>He was able to capture pictures,</i>

36:44.735 --> 36:46.970
he was able to capture videos.

36:46.972 --> 36:51.841
With all of this,
there is no doubt in my mind

36:51.843 --> 36:53.944
that this place is haunted.

36:59.884 --> 37:01.218
Who do you think it is?

37:01.220 --> 37:03.186
[tense music playing]

37:09.760 --> 37:12.963
[tense music playing]

37:13.831 --> 37:16.566
<i>[narrator] Kim and
Eric Masson's worst fears</i>

37:16.568 --> 37:19.035
<i>have just been confirmed.</i>

37:19.037 --> 37:23.340
<i>Their restaurant,
the Brentwood, is haunted.</i>

37:24.875 --> 37:26.243
<i>Mon Dieu, is that who you saw?</i>

37:26.877 --> 37:28.144
Yeah.

37:30.314 --> 37:33.049
Who do you think it is?

37:33.051 --> 37:37.954
Well, I'll start with the kind spirit
that I believe is the original owner.

37:38.289 --> 37:39.990
<i>Essie. You know her.</i>

37:39.992 --> 37:42.425
<i>[Kim] She loved this house.</i>

37:42.427 --> 37:43.827
<i>[Christina] And she still
loves it.</i>

37:43.829 --> 37:45.495
That's why she's still here.

37:46.897 --> 37:49.132
I think it was hard
for her when you came in

37:49.134 --> 37:51.534
and were making
this place your own.

37:51.536 --> 37:53.470
She didn't like that at first,

37:53.472 --> 37:57.207
but now she knows
you love the Brentwood, too.

37:58.009 --> 38:01.611
<i>[Stephen] I think Essie loves
the fact that a couple</i>

38:01.613 --> 38:04.281
like Kim and Eric
have that building,

38:04.283 --> 38:07.017
because they truly
are the heart of that place,

38:07.019 --> 38:08.018
as she was.

38:09.120 --> 38:12.956
<i>But the shadow man, not so much.</i>

38:13.858 --> 38:15.292
We think his name is Frank.

38:15.294 --> 38:17.727
That's the name
that we've been hearing

38:17.729 --> 38:19.562
during the investigation.

38:19.564 --> 38:24.067
It's my belief that Frank
is a dead fisherman.

38:24.069 --> 38:27.370
<i>There were many stories
about when Essie ran the--</i>

38:27.372 --> 38:29.572
<i>The building
as a bed and breakfast.</i>

38:29.574 --> 38:31.808
<i>Uh, one man in particular
was found dead on the porch.</i>

38:31.810 --> 38:35.445
<i>He was a raging alcoholic,
violent,</i>

38:35.447 --> 38:38.948
<i>she would never let him
actually stay in the building.</i>

38:38.950 --> 38:42.919
I think Frank is angry
that he never got to stay here

38:42.921 --> 38:45.021
when Essie was alive.

38:45.023 --> 38:49.893
So, in death, he's trying to
take control of the Brentwood.

38:49.895 --> 38:52.128
And we believe he's responsible

38:52.130 --> 38:54.998
for the more dangerous
and aggressive activity.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.467
He wants you to think
this place is his.

39:00.471 --> 39:02.372
So, what do we do?

39:04.275 --> 39:08.011
Well, I think you and Kim
are gonna have to decide that.

39:08.913 --> 39:12.048
Do you mind sharing
this place with Essie?

39:14.452 --> 39:15.785
- Uh... no.
- No...

39:15.787 --> 39:17.454
What about Frank?

39:17.456 --> 39:21.424
I-- I... I don't want anything
aggressive or negative.

39:21.426 --> 39:26.463
We have... we have patrons
and, um, employees. I--

39:26.465 --> 39:31.401
Then, as crazy as this sounds,
you need to tell them that.

39:32.136 --> 39:34.337
- Mmm-hmm.
- Out loud.

39:34.972 --> 39:37.207
Talk to the ghost?

39:37.209 --> 39:38.141
[Christina] Yes.

39:38.143 --> 39:39.242
[Eric chuckles]

39:41.011 --> 39:41.644
Now?

39:41.646 --> 39:43.680
Now.

39:43.682 --> 39:45.849
<i>[Stephen] When we talked
to Eric about confronting</i>

39:45.851 --> 39:47.851
<i>the darker side
of the Brentwood,</i>

39:47.853 --> 39:51.755
we told him to speak his mind,
speak his concerns.

39:51.757 --> 39:54.257
Just be truthful,
speak from the heart.

39:54.259 --> 39:57.293
<i>[Eric] I started to,
uh, address the ghost.</i>

39:57.695 --> 39:59.195
Uh...

40:01.766 --> 40:03.867
I know this was
your home first...

40:03.869 --> 40:07.804
"But you have to respect me,
too, 'cause I'm the owner now."

40:07.806 --> 40:10.874
but we're trying
to make it our home now.

40:10.876 --> 40:14.077
We've given everything
to do this, so...

40:14.079 --> 40:16.279
we have just as much to lose

40:18.783 --> 40:20.116
and you're hurting us.

40:20.751 --> 40:22.285
You're hurting us.

40:23.087 --> 40:26.256
We're afraid all the time.
We... we don't sleep.

40:27.191 --> 40:30.393
I can't... protect my wife.

40:30.661 --> 40:33.196
[sobbing]

40:36.734 --> 40:40.970
We don't mean any disrespect,
we just wanna love this house

40:41.906 --> 40:43.406
as much as you did.

40:45.242 --> 40:48.178
We're good people.
Please, let us do that.

40:52.249 --> 40:53.349
Is that okay?

40:55.019 --> 40:55.819
It's okay.

40:55.821 --> 40:58.988
[calm music playing]

41:01.559 --> 41:05.161
<i>[Eric] My belief in paranormal
has changed a lot.</i>

41:07.031 --> 41:11.568
Since I've been talking
to the ghosts, things really,

41:11.570 --> 41:13.670
<i>uh, started to quiet down.</i>

41:13.672 --> 41:16.105
<i>It's a completely
different feeling.</i>

41:16.107 --> 41:17.941
<i>I can walk around
the restaurant now</i>

41:17.943 --> 41:19.442
<i>and be just fine.</i>

41:19.944 --> 41:22.979
<i>I'm not scared of it anymore.</i>

41:23.814 --> 41:25.982
<i>[narrator] The Brentwood
now fully embraces</i>

41:25.984 --> 41:28.818
<i>its paranormal activity.</i>

41:28.820 --> 41:31.888
<i>Both the Massons
and the spirits inside</i>

41:31.890 --> 41:33.656
<i>are coexisting.</i>

41:33.658 --> 41:36.960
<i>[Kim] The feeling in the
restaurant changed for me a lot.</i>

41:37.695 --> 41:40.063
<i>I feel we're living
in harmony with them.</i>

41:40.065 --> 41:41.865
<i>I feel like they're
watching over.</i>

41:41.867 --> 41:46.202
<i>That they enjoy seeing all
of the customers coming in.</i>

41:48.138 --> 41:49.706
<i>[Eric] I think people
are scared about things</i>

41:49.708 --> 41:51.140
<i>they don't understand.</i>

41:54.845 --> 41:56.980
<i>There's a reason why it's there</i>

41:56.982 --> 41:59.282
<i>and then maybe there's
nothing to worry about.</i>

41:59.984 --> 42:02.118
[Essie sighs]

42:04.088 --> 42:07.257
