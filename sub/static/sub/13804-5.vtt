It's not a peep, Mom.
It's a cry for help.

No. It's supposed to

that made you look alive.

See, they don't get that.

13:26.037 --> 13:28.130
- So, you ready to go in, pal?
- You mean it?

13:28.206 --> 13:29.833
Absolutely. Come on.

13:30.908 --> 13:33.138
- You ready?
- Can I give you a hug?

13:33.211 --> 13:36.009
Not if I was chokin'
on a piece of sausage.

13:37.482 --> 13:39.416
- Zing!
- Zing!

13:39.484 --> 13:41.418
There's the Reba I love.

13:41.486 --> 13:43.477
- That's what I was tellin' him.
- I know.

13:43.554 --> 13:47.012
Okay, everybody.
All better. Ready to sing?

13:47.091 --> 13:49.821
Oh, I don't want Reba
to sing near me.

13:49.894 --> 13:51.828
I didn't bring my earplugs.

- What are you doin'?

13:56.300 --> 13:59.394
Zingin' you.

13:59.470 --> 14:02.064
- You know, 'cause I like you.
- [ Chuckles ]

Oh, you got me, all right.

14:05.143 --> 14:08.340
Oh, when's this party
gonna be over?

14:16.187 --> 14:18.178
Nothin'.

14:18.256 --> 14:20.918
- Reba, did you make the cake?
- Oh, you bet.

14:20.992 --> 14:22.926
No pre-made cake
for my little feller.

14:22.994 --> 14:24.928
It's very interesting.

14:24.996 --> 14:27.089
I've never had
sawdust cake before.

14:27.165 --> 14:29.861
[ Laughing ]

14:32.303 --> 14:35.204
Okeydokey. Now, how about
let's open some presents?

14:35.273 --> 14:37.104
- Yea!
- Here you go.

14:37.175 --> 14:40.406
This one's from me.
You're gonna love this,Jake.

14:40.478 --> 14:44.039
- Oh.
- It's a birdhouse kit!

14:44.115 --> 14:46.049
You get to build
a birdhouse and then paint it.

14:46.117 --> 14:48.085
Yeah, that's great.
[ Scoffs ]

14:48.152 --> 14:51.747
Maybe next year
you'll get him a rat condo.

14:54.459 --> 14:56.950
- Barbra Jean.
- Reba.

14:57.028 --> 15:01.727
- [ Laughing ]
- Well, you two are even more special than usual.

15:01.799 --> 15:04.768
This turned out to be a better party
than I thought it would. Is there any coffee?

15:04.836 --> 15:07.236
Oh, come on now, Brock.
You've had Reba's coffee.

15:07.305 --> 15:09.967
It'll make you cry.

15:10.041 --> 15:12.566
Kind of like Cheyenne did when she
was a baby and Reba wouldn't go to her.

15:12.643 --> 15:14.577
[ Imitates Baby Crying ]

15:14.645 --> 15:17.978
" I want my mommy,
but she won't come.''

15:19.951 --> 15:21.976
- Oh!
- Be right back.

15:22.053 --> 15:24.317
Me and my pal are gonna
go get the coffee.

15:24.388 --> 15:26.322
Okay.

15:28.025 --> 15:30.493
- You know what? I lied.
- Me too.

15:30.561 --> 15:33.257
Your cake didn't taste like sawdust.

15:33.331 --> 15:36.027
It tasted like sand. Zing!

15:37.034 --> 15:40.265
Stop that! Stop keepin' score.

15:40.338 --> 15:45.002
Which, by the way, if we were doing,
would be about a billion to one!

15:45.076 --> 15:48.568
[ Sighs ] I'm trying to be honest
with you, Barbra Jean.

15:48.646 --> 15:52.138
I say the stuff I say
because I'm still upset about the...

15:52.216 --> 15:54.548
situation.

15:54.619 --> 15:57.452
- Because I horned in on the party?
- No!

15:57.522 --> 16:00.389
I'm talkin' about the big situation.

16:00.458 --> 16:04.326
I'm talkin' about the thing that we
never talked through, woman-to-woman.

16:05.530 --> 16:07.521
- Oh, my gosh.
- Yeah.

16:07.598 --> 16:09.725
You're going through menopause.

16:11.235 --> 16:15.672
No, I'm not going
through menopause, you dingbat.

16:15.740 --> 16:19.198
You and Brock. That's what I'm talkin' about.
You wreckin' my marriage!

16:19.277 --> 16:20.801
Uh-

16:20.878 --> 16:23.813
Yea!

16:23.881 --> 16:26.543
Hey, look at you!

16:26.617 --> 16:30.917
Whoo! Look at them.
Look at that.

16:30.988 --> 16:34.549
I guess I've never actually brought this up
to you and talked about it face-to-face.

16:34.625 --> 16:36.855
And that's probably my fault.

16:36.928 --> 16:40.921
And maybe my clever little comments
when you're around are immature...

16:40.998 --> 16:42.932
but that's how
I've dealt with this.

16:44.235 --> 16:46.169
[ Sighs ]

16:46.237 --> 16:49.001
This hasn't been
easy for me, Barbra Jean.

16:50.074 --> 16:52.406
Well...

16:52.476 --> 16:56.105
- I am very sorry to hear that, Reba.
- Okay.

16:56.180 --> 16:58.375
Because, as you can imagine...

16:58.449 --> 17:02.579
it has just been
a freakin' picnic for me!

17:08.492 --> 17:12.121
You think your clever little comments
are tough for me to handle?

17:12.195 --> 17:17.156
[ Scoffs ]
Huh! I'm the other woman, Reba.

17:17.234 --> 17:20.261
I'm the whore of Babylon!

17:23.808 --> 17:26.935
I get looks and whispers...

17:27.011 --> 17:29.070
and fingers pointin' at me every day.

17:30.815 --> 17:33.113
But everybody acts friendly...

17:34.685 --> 17:37.449
just like you did today.

17:37.521 --> 17:40.422
Phony smiles and fake sincerity
hurt a whole lot worse...

17:40.491 --> 17:43.255
than your clever little jokes...

17:43.327 --> 17:46.660
which, frankly,
aren't all that clever either.

17:50.468 --> 17:53.494
Some of'em are.

17:53.571 --> 17:57.803
Look, if this is supposed to make me
feel sorry for you, it ain't workin'.

17:57.875 --> 18:01.174
I don't want you
to feel sorry for me, Reba.

18:01.245 --> 18:03.873
I just want to know where you stand.

18:03.948 --> 18:06.416
I want you to be honest with me.

18:07.485 --> 18:09.612
Okay. I can do that.

18:09.687 --> 18:11.917
Your party ideas are stupid.

18:11.989 --> 18:16.449
They didn't let you into clown college
'cause you're too big to fit into the car.

18:16.527 --> 18:19.291
And I sing way better than you.

- Yeah, sweetie, I do.

I remember sittin' outside y <i>our</i> door
frettin' the same way.

But I knew in my heart
it was the best thing for you.

the right things to do, you know?

19:26.931 --> 19:30.264
In the morning,
when I leave her to go to school.

19:30.334 --> 19:32.666
And when I come home,
and she's already in bed.

19:34.739 --> 19:37.230
And when I have
to study French philosophy...

19:37.308 --> 19:39.833
instead of playing peekaboo with her.

19:39.910 --> 19:41.844

they don't feel right, Mom.
