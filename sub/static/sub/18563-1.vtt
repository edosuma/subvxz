WEBVTT

02:25.980 --> 02:27.606
Mr. Adams!

02:29.400 --> 02:30.735
Mr. Adams!

02:32.069 --> 02:33.404
Mr. Adams!

02:34.905 --> 02:36.240
There you are.

02:36.324 --> 02:39.118
Didn't you hear me call you, Mr. Adams?

02:39.201 --> 02:43.664
You could've shouted down something,
saved me climbing up four flights.

02:43.748 --> 02:47.293
A man that likes to talk
as much as you do, I'd think...

02:48.794 --> 02:52.048
What do you keep coming
up here for, Mr. Adams?

02:52.131 --> 02:54.925
Afraid someone's going to steal our bell?

02:55.593 --> 02:57.345
Well, don't worry.

02:57.428 --> 03:01.265
Been here more than 14 years,
and ain't been carried off once.

03:04.727 --> 03:07.855
Better get yourself
back down to congress, Mr. Adams.

03:07.938 --> 03:11.859
Getting ready to vote, and they said they
couldn't settle such an important question

03:11.942 --> 03:14.403
without Massachusetts being there.

03:15.905 --> 03:17.865
I can just imagine.

03:22.620 --> 03:27.208
All right. What burning issue
are we voting on this time?

03:27.291 --> 03:31.212
On whether or not
to Grant general Washington's request

03:31.295 --> 03:34.673
that all members
of the Rhode Island militia be required

03:34.757 --> 03:36.801
to wear matching uniforms.

03:38.260 --> 03:39.970
Oh, good god.

04:17.341 --> 04:19.093
I have come to the conclusion

04:19.176 --> 04:23.431
that one useless man is called a disgrace,

04:24.265 --> 04:27.726
that two are called a law firm,

04:28.185 --> 04:32.565
and that three or more become a congress.

04:32.648 --> 04:36.277
And, by god, I have had this congress.

04:36.360 --> 04:39.155
For 10 years,
king George and his parliament

04:39.238 --> 04:43.659
have gulled, cullied and diddled
these colonies with their illegal taxes.

04:43.742 --> 04:47.746
Stamp acts,
townshend acts, sugar acts, tea acts.

04:48.539 --> 04:50.541
And when we dared stand up like men,

04:50.624 --> 04:53.794
they have stopped our trade,
seized our ships,

04:53.878 --> 04:56.672
blockaded our ports, burned our towns,

04:56.755 --> 04:59.383
and spilled our blood.

04:59.467 --> 05:04.805
And still this congress refuses to Grant
any of my proposals on independence

05:04.889 --> 05:08.184
even so much as the courtesy
of open debate.

05:08.267 --> 05:11.312
Good god,
what in the hell are you waiting for?

05:12.146 --> 05:15.483
<i>Sit down, John. Sit down, John</i>

05:15.566 --> 05:17.318
Thomas, for god's sake, listen to me.

05:17.401 --> 05:19.111
<i>For god's sake, John, sit down</i>

05:19.195 --> 05:21.155
I've had enough of you, sir.

05:21.238 --> 05:22.781
<i>Sit down, John sit down, John</i>

05:22.865 --> 05:25.493
<i>for god's sake, John, sit down</i>

05:25.576 --> 05:27.161
<i>someone ought to open up a window</i>

05:27.244 --> 05:29.004
will you listen to me
and forget the window?

05:29.079 --> 05:30.247
<i>It's 90 degrees</i>

05:30.331 --> 05:32.124
<i>have mercy, John, please</i>

05:32.208 --> 05:34.502
<i>it's hot as hell in Philadelphia</i>

05:34.585 --> 05:37.087
<i>someone ought to open up a window</i>

05:37.171 --> 05:39.673
<i>I say vote yes</i>

05:39.757 --> 05:41.550
<i>vote yes</i>

05:41.634 --> 05:43.844
<i>vote for independency</i>

05:43.928 --> 05:46.514
<i>someone ought to open up a window</i>

05:46.597 --> 05:48.766
<i>I say vote yes</i>

05:48.849 --> 05:50.768
<i>sit down, John</i>

05:50.851 --> 05:52.853
<i>vote for independency</i>

05:52.937 --> 05:55.314
<i>someone ought to open up a window</i>

05:55.397 --> 05:56.398
<i>no, no, no!</i>

05:56.482 --> 05:59.777
<i>Too many flies, too many flies</i>

05:59.860 --> 06:02.530
<i>but it's hot as hell in Philadelphia</i>

06:02.613 --> 06:04.657
<i>are you gonna open up a window?</i>

06:04.740 --> 06:06.700
<i>Can't we compromise here?</i>

06:06.784 --> 06:08.118
<i>Vote yes</i>

06:08.202 --> 06:10.371
<i>no, too many flies here</i>

06:10.454 --> 06:11.872
<i>vote yes</i>

06:11.956 --> 06:14.667
<i>oh, for god's sake, John, sit down</i>

06:14.750 --> 06:17.336
good god. Consider yourselves fortunate

06:17.419 --> 06:19.421
that you have John Adams to abuse,

06:19.505 --> 06:21.674
for no sane man would tolerate it.

06:21.757 --> 06:23.217
<i>John, you're a bore</i>

06:23.300 --> 06:25.177
<i>we've heard this before</i>

06:25.261 --> 06:27.638
<i>now, for god's sake, John, sit down</i>

06:27.721 --> 06:30.015
<i>- I say vote yes
- no!</i>

06:30.099 --> 06:31.809
<i>- Vote yes
- no!</i>

06:31.892 --> 06:34.061
<i>Vote for independency</i>

06:34.144 --> 06:36.146
<i>someone ought to open up a window</i>

06:36.814 --> 06:38.899
<i>I say vote yes</i>

06:38.983 --> 06:41.235
<i>sit down, John</i>

06:41.318 --> 06:44.029
<i>vote for independency</i>

06:44.113 --> 06:46.240
<i>will someone shut that man up?</i>

06:46.323 --> 06:47.950
Never!

06:48.993 --> 06:50.619
Never!

06:55.499 --> 06:56.750
Dear god.

06:57.960 --> 07:02.339
For one solid year
they have been sitting here. A whole year!

07:02.423 --> 07:03.924
Doing nothing!

07:04.842 --> 07:09.388
<i>I do believe
you've laid a curse on north America</i>

07:10.764 --> 07:15.394
<i>a curse that we
here now rehearse in Philadelphia</i>

07:16.353 --> 07:18.605
<i>a second flood, a simple famine</i>

07:18.689 --> 07:20.607
<i>plagues of locusts everywhere</i>

07:20.691 --> 07:22.568
<i>or a cataclysmic earthquake</i>

07:22.651 --> 07:24.611
<i>I'd accept with some despair</i>

07:24.695 --> 07:28.282
<i>but, no, you've sent us congress</i>

07:28.365 --> 07:32.703
<i>good god, sir, was that fair?</i>

07:34.621 --> 07:39.626
<i>I say this with humility in Philadelphia</i>

07:40.627 --> 07:45.299
<i>we're your responsibility in Philadelphia</i>

07:46.300 --> 07:50.637
<i>if you don't want to see us hanging
from some far off British hill</i>

07:50.721 --> 07:54.516
<i>if you don't want the voice of independency
forever stilled</i>

07:54.600 --> 07:58.020
<i>then god, sir, get thee to it</i>

07:58.228 --> 08:02.232
<i>for congress never will</i>

08:02.733 --> 08:05.402
<i>you see, we piddle, twiddle and resolve</i>

08:05.527 --> 08:07.571
<i>not one damn thing do we solve</i>

08:07.654 --> 08:09.740
<i>piddle, twiddle and resolve</i>

08:09.823 --> 08:11.575
<i>nothing's ever solved</i>

08:11.658 --> 08:15.162
<i>in foul, fetid, fuming, foggy, filthy</i>

08:15.245 --> 08:17.539
<i>Philadelphia</i>

08:17.790 --> 08:20.959
<i>someone ought to open up a window</i>

08:21.043 --> 08:22.711
shut up.

08:23.754 --> 08:27.383
<i>I now call congress' attention
to the petition of Mr. melchior meng,</i>

08:27.466 --> 08:30.552
<i>who claims $20 compensation
for his dead mule.</i>

08:30.636 --> 08:33.179
<i>It seems the animal was employed
transporting luggage</i>

08:33.263 --> 08:34.681
<i>in the service of congress.</i>

08:34.765 --> 08:37.893
<i>The question, then,
would appear to be one of occasion.</i>

08:37.976 --> 08:41.605
<i>For if the mule expired not while carrying,</i>

08:41.938 --> 08:43.941
<i>but after being unloaded,</i>

08:44.191 --> 08:47.444
<i>then clearly the beast dropped dead
on its own time.</i>

08:47.903 --> 08:49.822
Oh, good god.

08:51.448 --> 08:56.203
<i>They may sit here for years and years
in Philadelphia</i>

08:57.496 --> 09:02.251
<i>these indecisive grenadiers of Philadelphia</i>

09:03.085 --> 09:07.423
<i>they can't agree on what is right and wrong
or what is good or bad</i>

09:07.589 --> 09:11.009
<i>I'm convinced the only purpose
this congress ever had</i>

09:11.135 --> 09:14.388
<i>was to gather here specifically</i>

09:14.471 --> 09:17.808
<i>to drive John Adams mad!</i>

09:18.350 --> 09:21.061
<i>You see, we piddle, twiddle and resolve</i>

09:21.145 --> 09:22.938
<i>not one damn thing do we solve</i>

09:23.021 --> 09:25.065
<i>piddle, twiddle and resolve</i>

09:25.149 --> 09:26.650
<i>nothing's ever solved</i>

09:26.859 --> 09:30.070
<i>in foul, fetid, fuming, foggy, filthy</i>

09:30.154 --> 09:31.155
<i>Philadelphia</i>

09:31.280 --> 09:32.739
<i>John, john</i>

09:32.823 --> 09:37.202
<i>ls that you carrying on, John?</i>

09:38.328 --> 09:42.833
Abigail, Abigail, I have such a desire
to knock heads together.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.419
<i>Then why
in heaven's name do you stay there?</i>

09:45.502 --> 09:48.589
<i>Come home to Boston, John.
It's only 300 miles.</i>

09:48.672 --> 09:51.258
<i>If you left tonight,
you could be here in only eight days.</i>

09:51.341 --> 09:53.635
How can I do that, Abigail?

09:53.719 --> 09:57.264
I'm no further along now than I was
when I first came here.

09:57.347 --> 09:59.266
I know, my dearest. I know.

09:59.349 --> 10:02.311
But that's because you make
everything so complicated.

10:02.394 --> 10:04.146
It's all quite simple, really.

10:04.480 --> 10:07.441
<i>Just tell the congress to declare</i>

10:07.524 --> 10:10.819
<i>independency</i>

10:10.903 --> 10:13.071
<i>then sign your name get out of there</i>

10:13.155 --> 10:16.742
<i>and hurry home to me</i>

10:16.825 --> 10:19.495
<i>our children all have dysentery</i>

10:19.578 --> 10:21.705
<i>little tom keeps turning blue</i>

10:21.788 --> 10:23.707
<i>little Abby has the measles</i>

10:23.790 --> 10:26.043
<i>and I'm coming down with flu</i>

10:26.126 --> 10:29.129
<i>they say we may get smallpox</i>

10:29.213 --> 10:31.840
madam, what else is new?

10:35.302 --> 10:37.095
Abigail, in my last letter, I wrote you

10:37.179 --> 10:41.850
that the king had collected 12,000
German mercenaries to send against us.

10:41.934 --> 10:46.438
I asked you to organize the ladies
to make saltpeter for gunpowder.

10:46.855 --> 10:49.441
- Now, have you done as I asked?
- No, John, I have not.

10:49.525 --> 10:51.109
Well, why have you not?

10:51.193 --> 10:54.363
Because you neglected
to tell us how saltpeter is made.

10:54.905 --> 10:58.408
By treating sodium nitrate
with potassium chloride, of course.

10:58.492 --> 10:59.826
Oh, yes, of course.

10:59.910 --> 11:01.036
Will it be done, then?

11:01.370 --> 11:03.872
John, I'm afraid
we have a more urgent problem.

11:03.956 --> 11:05.624
More urgent, madam?

11:05.999 --> 11:10.254
<i>There's one thing every woman's missed
in Massachusetts bay</i>

11:12.381 --> 11:14.758
<i>don't smirk at me, you egotist</i>

11:14.883 --> 11:18.637
<i>pay heed to what I say</i>

11:18.720 --> 11:21.098
<i>we've gone from framingham to Boston</i>

11:21.181 --> 11:23.058
<i>and we cannot find a pin</i>

11:23.725 --> 11:27.646
<i>"don't you know there's a war on"
say the tradesmen with a grin</i>

11:27.729 --> 11:32.317
<i>well, we will not make saltpeter</i>

11:32.401 --> 11:36.572
<i>until you send us pins</i>

11:36.697 --> 11:38.824
pins, madam? Saltpeter.

11:38.907 --> 11:40.951
- Pins.
- Saltpeter.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.286
Pins.

11:42.369 --> 11:43.495
- Saltpeter.
- Pins.

11:43.579 --> 11:44.579
- Saltpeter.
- Pins.

11:44.621 --> 11:45.664
- 'Peter.
- Pins.

11:45.747 --> 11:47.124
- 'Peter. 'Peter.
- Pins. Pins.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.417
'Peter!

11:49.459 --> 11:50.586
Pins.

11:52.296 --> 11:54.339
Done, madam, done.

11:54.423 --> 11:55.799
Done, John.

11:57.009 --> 11:59.303
Hurry home, John.

11:59.386 --> 12:00.554
As soon as I'm able.

12:00.637 --> 12:02.514
Don't stop writing. It's all I have.

12:02.598 --> 12:04.766
Every day, my dearest friend.

13:11.667 --> 13:13.251
Franklin!

13:15.504 --> 13:16.797
Franklin!

13:18.674 --> 13:20.509
Where in hell are you?

13:21.802 --> 13:23.178
Franklin!

13:23.261 --> 13:25.681
I see you hiding behind that tree.

13:26.390 --> 13:27.724
It won't do you any good.

13:28.934 --> 13:31.770
Damn it, this is no time for playing games.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.817
Franklin, I have been looking
everywhere for you.

13:36.900 --> 13:39.194
Where in god's name have you been?

13:39.277 --> 13:42.239
Right here, John,
being preserved for posterity.

13:42.322 --> 13:43.865
Do you like it?

13:47.828 --> 13:49.246
It stinks.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.914
As ever, the soul of tact.

13:50.997 --> 13:52.499
Well, the man's no botticelli.

13:52.582 --> 13:54.459
And the subject's no Venus.

13:54.543 --> 13:57.421
Franklin, where were you last night
when I needed you?

13:57.504 --> 13:59.344
You should have heard
what I suffered in there.

13:59.381 --> 14:02.801
I heard, all right.
Along with the rest of Philadelphia.

14:02.884 --> 14:04.636
Lord, your voice is piercing, John.

14:04.720 --> 14:07.514
Well, I wish to heaven my arguments were.

14:08.056 --> 14:11.143
My god, Franklin,
when are they going to make up their minds?

14:11.226 --> 14:14.980
With one hand they can raise an army,
dispatch one of their own to lead it,

14:15.063 --> 14:17.315
and cheer the news from bunker's hill.

14:17.399 --> 14:20.152
And with the other,
they wave the olive branch,

14:20.235 --> 14:23.280
begging the king for a happy
and permanent reconciliation.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.949
Fat George has declared us in rebellion.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.617
Why in bloody hell can't they?

14:27.701 --> 14:31.246
John, really?
You talk as if independence were the rule.

14:31.329 --> 14:33.165
It's never been done before.

14:33.248 --> 14:36.208
No colony has ever broken from the
parent stem in the history of the world.

14:36.251 --> 14:39.337
Damn it, Franklin,
you make us sound treasonous.

14:39.421 --> 14:41.006
<i>Do i'.></i>

14:41.089 --> 14:42.466
treason, eh?

14:43.425 --> 14:47.846
Treason is a charge invented by winners
as an excuse for hanging the losers.

14:48.263 --> 14:51.308
I have more to do than stand here,
listening to you quote yourself.

14:51.433 --> 14:53.560
No, that was a new one.

14:53.643 --> 14:55.854
Damn it, Franklin, we're at war.

14:55.937 --> 14:57.856
To defend ourselves, nothing more.

14:57.939 --> 15:00.567
We expressed our displeasure,
the English moved against us,

15:00.650 --> 15:02.110
and we in turn have resisted.

15:02.194 --> 15:05.864
Now our fellow congressmen want to effect
a reconciliation before it becomes a war.

15:05.947 --> 15:07.616
Reconciliation, my ass.

15:07.699 --> 15:09.701
The people want independence.

15:09.785 --> 15:11.745
<i>The people have read
Mr. paine's common sense.</i>

15:11.828 --> 15:14.122
I doubt very much congress has.

15:14.581 --> 15:15.791
That's true.

15:15.874 --> 15:17.667
John, why don't you give it up?

15:17.751 --> 15:20.212
Nobody listens to you.
You're obnoxious and disliked.

15:21.630 --> 15:25.050
L'm not promoting John Adams.
I'm promoting independence.

15:25.133 --> 15:27.344
Evidently, they cannot help
connecting the two.

15:27.969 --> 15:29.805
Even your own cousin.

15:29.888 --> 15:33.141
And if Sam Adams can't put up with you,
nobody can.

15:33.683 --> 15:35.811
You're getting at something.

15:36.937 --> 15:38.772
How can you tell?

15:38.855 --> 15:40.124
All right, outwith it, Franklin.

15:40.148 --> 15:42.651
What new intrigue are you cooking up?

15:43.318 --> 15:46.154
Let someone else in congress propose.

15:47.030 --> 15:48.198
Never!

15:56.039 --> 15:58.333
Why? Who did you have in mind?

15:58.416 --> 16:00.627
I don't know.
I really haven't given it much thought.

16:03.171 --> 16:04.881
You sent for me, Benjamin?

16:05.715 --> 16:06.758
Never.

16:06.842 --> 16:10.011
- Hello, Johnny!
- Richard.

16:10.095 --> 16:12.514
Johnny and I need some advice.

16:13.014 --> 16:15.016
If it's mine to give, it's
yours, you know that.

16:15.100 --> 16:16.351
Thank you, Richard.

16:16.434 --> 16:19.938
As you know, the cause that we support
has come to a complete standstill.

16:20.021 --> 16:21.940
- Now why do you suppose that is?
- Simple.

16:22.023 --> 16:24.526
- Johnny here is obnoxious and disliked.
- That's true.

16:24.609 --> 16:27.112
Now, what's the solution, I wonder?

16:28.864 --> 16:31.366
Get somebody else in congress to propose.

16:31.449 --> 16:33.076
Richard, that's brilliant.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.078
- Wasn't that brilliant, John?
- Brilliant.

16:35.161 --> 16:37.372
Yes. Now the question remains,
who can it be?

16:37.455 --> 16:39.749
The man that we need
must belong to a delegation

16:39.833 --> 16:41.710
publicly committed
to support independence.

16:41.793 --> 16:43.521
And at the present time,
only Massachusetts,

16:43.545 --> 16:45.273
New Hampshire
and Delaware have declared our way.

16:45.297 --> 16:47.674
And Virginia. Don't forget Virginia, benjy.

16:47.757 --> 16:49.384
Richard, I haven't. How could I?

16:49.467 --> 16:52.637
But strictly speaking, while Virginia's
views on independence are well known,

16:52.721 --> 16:55.765
your legislature in williamsburg
has never formally authorized

16:55.849 --> 16:58.643
its delegation here in congress
to support the cause.

16:58.768 --> 17:02.439
Now, if we could think of a virginian
with enough influence to go down there

17:02.522 --> 17:04.148
and persuade the house of burgesses...

17:04.232 --> 17:07.234
Damn me if I haven't thought of someone!

17:07.319 --> 17:08.444
'Who?
'Who?

17:08.528 --> 17:09.529
Me.

17:09.613 --> 17:11.156
Why didn't I think of that?

17:11.239 --> 17:12.781
I'll leave tonight.

17:12.866 --> 17:15.410
Why, hell, I'll leave
right now, if you like.

17:15.618 --> 17:18.538
I'll just stop off in stratford long enough
to refresh the missus,

17:18.622 --> 17:21.040
and then straight to the matter.

17:21.124 --> 17:23.960
Yes, sir. I really have to compliment
you on yourjudgment, Johnny.

17:24.044 --> 17:25.462
Whoa, boy. Steady.

17:25.545 --> 17:28.381
You've come to the one colony
that can get the job done.

17:28.464 --> 17:31.676
Virginia, the land that gave
us our glorious commander in chief,

17:32.719 --> 17:33.887
George Washington,

17:33.970 --> 17:37.307
will now give the continent
its proposal on independence.

17:37.390 --> 17:40.560
And when Virginia proposes,
the south is bound to follow.

17:40.644 --> 17:44.064
And where the south goes,
the middle colonies go.

17:44.147 --> 17:46.149
Gentlemen, a salute.

17:46.232 --> 17:49.903
To Virginia,
the mother of American independence.

17:49.986 --> 17:53.281
Incredible. We're free,
and he hasn't even left yet.

17:53.365 --> 17:55.992
What makes you so sure you can do it?

17:57.160 --> 18:01.206
<i>My name is Richard Henry Lee
Virginia is my home</i>

18:01.289 --> 18:06.586
<i>my name is Richard Henry Lee
Virginia is my home</i>

18:06.670 --> 18:11.132
<i>and may my horses turn to glue

He will, John. He will.

19:14.237 --> 19:17.657
<i>They say that god in heaven
is everybody's god</i>

19:17.741 --> 19:18.783

19:18.867 --> 19:24.039
<i>I'll admit that god in heaven

19:24.122 --> 19:26.666

20:22.472 --> 20:28.269

20:33.691 --> 20:37.862
That was the most revolting display
i have ever witnessed.

20:37.946 --> 20:39.823
They're a warm-blooded people, virginians.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.033
Not him, Franklin. You.

20:42.158 --> 20:44.744
You and your infernal obsession
for deviousness.

20:44.828 --> 20:47.973
If you'd come straight out and asked the
man, he'd have been gone a half hour ago.

20:47.997 --> 20:50.291
Yes, and he'd have been doing us a favor.

20:50.375 --> 20:53.378
Cheer up, John. At this very moment,
our cause is again riding high,

20:53.461 --> 20:56.506
sitting straight in the saddle
and in full gallop for Virginia.

20:56.589 --> 21:00.760
<i>And our women are serene</i>

21:00.844 --> 21:01.886
good god.

21:01.970 --> 21:03.763
<i>Full-bosomed</i>

21:04.013 --> 21:06.891
<i>full-bosomed</i>

21:06.975 --> 21:11.813
<i>full-bosomed, benjy
everyone a queen</i>

21:12.438 --> 21:16.109
<i>why they are lees, damn it
lees of old Virginia!</i>

21:16.192 --> 21:19.195
<i>Yes, sir, by god, it's
here a Lee, there a Lee!</i>

21:19.279 --> 21:21.489
<i>C'mon, John, step lively</i>

21:21.573 --> 21:23.658
<i>- here a Lee, there a Lee
- here a Lee, there a Lee</i>

21:23.741 --> 21:25.511
<i>- everywhere</i> a <i>Lee,</i> a <i>Lee
- everywhere</i> a <i>Lee,</i> a <i>Lee</i>

21:25.535 --> 21:27.388
<i>- here a Lee, there a Lee

21:27.412 --> 21:29.223
<i>- everywhere</i> a <i>Lee,</i> a <i>Lee!
- Everywhere</i> a <i>Lee,</i> a <i>Lee!</i>

21:29.247 --> 21:33.168
<i>Forward, ho</i>

22:04.073 --> 22:06.743
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

22:06.826 --> 22:10.580
I'm Dr. lyman hall,
the new delegate from Georgia.

22:10.663 --> 22:14.042
I'm Andrew mcnair, congressional custodian.

22:14.125 --> 22:17.003
If you'll be wanting anything at all,
just holler out "mcnair"

22:17.086 --> 22:20.673
as all the others do
and there won't be too long to wait.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.927
Where does the Georgia delegation belong?

22:24.010 --> 22:28.097
They mill about over there in that corner,
near the two carolinas.

22:33.853 --> 22:36.022
It's after 10:00.

22:36.105 --> 22:38.149
I was told congress convenes at 10:00.

22:38.233 --> 22:42.362
Well, they'll be wandering in
any time now, sir, with old grape and guts

22:42.445 --> 22:44.280
- leading the pack.
- Old who?

22:44.364 --> 22:45.740
Mcnair!

22:45.823 --> 22:47.116
Grape and guts.

22:47.700 --> 22:48.868
'Nair!

22:49.994 --> 22:51.496
Fetch me a rum.

22:51.579 --> 22:55.667
Mr. Hopkins,
you'll be pleased to meet Dr. lyman hall.

22:57.043 --> 22:58.920
I don't need a doctor, damn it.

22:59.003 --> 23:01.256
New delegate from Georgia.

23:01.339 --> 23:03.466
Well, why didn't you say so?

23:04.217 --> 23:08.137
I'm Stephen Hopkins,
old delegate from Rhode Island.

23:08.221 --> 23:09.764
Mcnair, fetch two rums.

23:09.847 --> 23:12.475
I fear it's a little early in the day.

23:14.602 --> 23:16.187
Nonsense.

23:16.271 --> 23:20.733
It's a medicinal fact that rum
gets a man's heart started in the morning.

23:22.151 --> 23:24.529
I'm surprised you didn't know that.

23:24.612 --> 23:27.073
Speaking as the oldest man
in the congress, I can tell you...

23:27.156 --> 23:30.159
Ben Franklin is older by almost a year.

23:30.243 --> 23:31.452
Rum!

23:37.166 --> 23:38.501
Tell me, doctor.

23:38.584 --> 23:41.796
Where does Georgia stand
on the question of independence?

23:41.879 --> 23:44.173
With south Carolina, of course.

23:45.258 --> 23:46.968
Neddy, good morning.

23:47.051 --> 23:50.221
Neddy, come over here and shake the hand
of Dr. lyman hall of Georgia.

23:50.305 --> 23:53.266
Dr. hall, this here is
Edward Rutledge from...

23:53.349 --> 23:56.811
Whichever Carolina he says he's from.
God knows I can't keep them straight.

23:56.894 --> 23:59.272
- It's a pleasure, Dr. hall.
- Your servant, Mr. Rutledge.

23:59.355 --> 24:02.191
You've met the long
and the short of it now, doctor.

24:02.275 --> 24:04.986
Neddy here is just a lad.
He's the youngest of us.

24:05.069 --> 24:06.696
Except for Ben Franklin.

24:06.779 --> 24:09.073
- Mcnair!
- Your rum!

24:09.949 --> 24:12.577
Well, where did you go for it, man?
Jamaica?

24:13.453 --> 24:15.371
Well, now, come along, Dr. hall.

24:15.455 --> 24:19.500
I know you must be anxious
to meet your colleagues from the south.

24:21.169 --> 24:23.296
Doctor, may I present to you Joseph Hewes.

24:23.379 --> 24:26.049
This is Dr. lyman hall,
the new delegate from Georgia.

24:26.132 --> 24:27.532
An honor and a pleasure, gentlemen.

24:27.592 --> 24:29.469
Where do you stand on independence,
Dr. hall?

24:29.969 --> 24:32.138
I'm here without instructions, Mr. Hewes,

24:32.221 --> 24:35.016
able to vote my own personal convictions.

24:35.808 --> 24:37.268
And they are?

24:41.356 --> 24:42.607
Personal.

24:44.025 --> 24:45.651
Now, Dr. hall,

24:46.444 --> 24:48.780
the deep south speaks with one voice.

24:48.863 --> 24:50.239
It's traditional.

24:50.323 --> 24:53.493
Even more, it is historical.

24:54.410 --> 24:56.079
Enter Delaware.

24:58.247 --> 24:59.457
Speak plain, Rutledge.

24:59.540 --> 25:02.418
You know I can't follow a word
of your damn French.

25:02.502 --> 25:04.170
It's Latin, colonel mckean,

25:04.253 --> 25:08.007
a tribute to the eternal peace and Harmony
of the Delaware delegation.

25:08.091 --> 25:10.927
What are you saying, man?
You know perfectly well

25:11.010 --> 25:14.180
that neither Rodney nor i
can stand the sight of this louse.

25:14.263 --> 25:15.306
Now, Thomas...

25:15.390 --> 25:16.516
Gentlemen, please.

25:16.599 --> 25:19.727
This is Dr. lyman hall of Georgia.

25:20.686 --> 25:21.771
Caesar Rodney.

25:21.854 --> 25:22.897
- An honor, sir.
- Sir.

25:22.980 --> 25:26.526
George read and colonel Thomas mckean.

25:26.609 --> 25:27.729
- Dr. hall...
- Your servant.

25:27.985 --> 25:31.114
I wonder if I might speak
to you for a moment in private.

25:31.197 --> 25:32.365
By all means.

25:35.660 --> 25:36.661
Mcnair!

25:36.744 --> 25:38.287
I'm coming! I'm coming!

25:38.371 --> 25:40.706
Help me. I'm stuck.

25:43.751 --> 25:45.211
Tell me, sir,

25:45.753 --> 25:50.049
would you be a doctor
of medicine or theology?

25:50.758 --> 25:53.302
Both, Mr. Rodney.
Which one can be of service?

25:53.386 --> 25:55.972
By all means, the physician first.

25:56.055 --> 25:58.516
Then we shall see about the other.

25:59.642 --> 26:01.894
I shall call at your convenience, sir.

26:11.112 --> 26:15.700
I trust, Caesar, when you're through
converting the poor fellow to independency

26:15.783 --> 26:19.078
that you'll give
the opposition a fair crack at him.

26:20.121 --> 26:22.415
You're too late, John.

26:22.498 --> 26:24.959
Once I get them, they're got.

26:25.042 --> 26:30.006
Dr. lyman hall of Georgia,
Mr. John Dickinson of Pennsylvania.

26:30.089 --> 26:32.675
- An honor, sir.
- Your servant, sir.

26:32.758 --> 26:34.927
Tell me, doctor.

26:35.011 --> 26:36.804
Where do you stand on the question of...

26:37.096 --> 26:38.264
Independence?

26:38.764 --> 26:39.765
Treason.

26:42.727 --> 26:43.936
I've no stomach for it.

26:44.479 --> 26:47.064
Then be careful not to
dine with John Adams.

26:47.148 --> 26:48.691
Between the fish and the souffle,

26:48.774 --> 26:51.486
you'll find yourself
hanging from an English rope.

26:51.569 --> 26:52.778
Your servant, sir.

26:56.282 --> 27:00.578
Judge Wilson, forgive me,
but how can anyone see you

27:00.661 --> 27:04.624
if you insist on standing
in Mr. Dickinson's shadow?

27:05.833 --> 27:09.795
James Wilson, also of Pennsylvania.

27:09.879 --> 27:10.963
Sir.

27:12.340 --> 27:13.841
An honor, sir.

27:14.675 --> 27:16.802
Good morning. Good morning.

27:19.555 --> 27:21.682
Good morning, ladies. Good morning.

27:21.766 --> 27:23.309
Steady, steady.

27:24.936 --> 27:27.647
Make gangway, sir. Make gangway!

27:27.730 --> 27:29.982
Good morning, Mr. Wilson. Good morning.

27:30.066 --> 27:33.069
Watch where you're going, damn it.
Over there.

27:33.444 --> 27:36.405
Mcnair, get me out of this thing.

27:36.489 --> 27:38.616
Watch out for my foot.

27:38.699 --> 27:39.825
Good morning, all.

27:39.909 --> 27:41.869
- Morning, Ben.
- Morning, Ben.

27:42.203 --> 27:45.540
Here you are. Two coppers apiece.
Now, straight back to jail with you.

27:45.623 --> 27:48.209
- Good morning, Stephen.
- All right, Benjamin.

27:49.293 --> 27:50.545
Dear god.

27:53.256 --> 27:54.632
What are you staring at?

27:54.715 --> 27:56.926
Haven't you ever seen a great man before?

27:57.009 --> 27:59.303
Good lord, sir.
Do you have the honor to be Dr. Franklin?

27:59.387 --> 28:03.349
Yes, I have that honor. Unfortunately,
the gout accompanies the honor.

28:03.432 --> 28:04.952
Been living too high again, eh, pappy?

28:05.017 --> 28:08.938
Stephen, I only wish king George
felt like my big toe all over.

28:10.731 --> 28:14.485
Mcnair! Fetch a pillow and two more rums.

28:14.569 --> 28:16.004
Well, Franklin, where's that idiot Lee?

28:16.028 --> 28:17.655
Is he back yet? I don't see him.

28:17.738 --> 28:20.491
Softly, John. Your voice
is hurting my foot.

28:20.575 --> 28:24.161
One more Clay, Franklin. That's how long
I'll remain silent, not a minute longer.

28:24.245 --> 28:26.789
That strutting popinjay
was so damn sure of himself.

28:26.872 --> 28:29.083
He's had time to bring back
a dozen proposals by now.

28:29.166 --> 28:30.209
Tell me, James.

28:30.293 --> 28:33.629
How do you explain the strange,
monumental quietude

28:33.713 --> 28:36.215
that congress has been treated
to these past 30 days?

28:36.299 --> 28:39.927
Has the ill wind
of independence finally blown itself out?

28:40.803 --> 28:42.638
Well, if you ask me...

28:42.722 --> 28:46.392
For myself, I must confess
that a month free from new england noise

28:46.475 --> 28:48.436
is more therapeutic
than a month in the country.

28:48.519 --> 28:50.146
Don't you agree, James?

28:50.229 --> 28:51.355
Well, lfeel...

28:51.439 --> 28:53.482
Mr. Adams, pray look for your voice, sir.

28:53.566 --> 28:58.237
It cannot be far, and god knows we need
the entertainment in congress.

29:02.450 --> 29:03.659
Congratulations, John.

29:03.743 --> 29:05.762
You just made
your greatest contribution to independence.

29:05.786 --> 29:07.079
You kept your flap shut.

29:07.163 --> 29:08.581
One more day, Franklin.

29:08.664 --> 29:10.916
Then I shall do the proposing.

29:12.251 --> 29:15.963
Gentlemen, the usual morning
festivities concluded,

29:16.047 --> 29:18.466
I will now call congress to order.

29:18.883 --> 29:20.384
Mr. thomson.

29:23.971 --> 29:27.600
The second continental congress meeting in
the city of Philadelphia is now in session.

29:27.683 --> 29:31.228
7 June, 1776, the 380th meeting.

29:31.312 --> 29:32.938
Sweet Jesus!

29:34.774 --> 29:38.110
The honorable John hancock
of Massachusetts bay, president.

29:40.154 --> 29:43.032
Thank you, Mr. thomson. Mr. mcnair.

29:43.115 --> 29:46.452
The stores of rum and other
drinking spirits are hereby closed

29:46.535 --> 29:50.039
to the colony of Rhode Island
for a period of three days.

29:50.122 --> 29:51.499
Yes, sir.

29:51.582 --> 29:53.376
Johnny, you can't do that.

29:53.459 --> 29:56.754
Sit down, Mr. Hopkins.
You've abused the privilege.

29:59.256 --> 30:01.133
The chair would like to
take this opportunity

30:01.217 --> 30:04.178
to welcome Dr. lyman hall of Georgia
to this congress,

30:04.261 --> 30:06.263
and hopes he will make the best of it.

30:09.475 --> 30:11.352
My god, it's hot.

30:12.353 --> 30:14.563
The secretary will read the roll.

30:14.647 --> 30:16.899
All members present
with the following exceptions.

30:17.441 --> 30:20.236
"Mr. paine, Mr. Gerry,
Mr. Samuel Adams of Massachusetts,

30:20.319 --> 30:21.987
"Mr. Morton of Pennsylvania,

30:22.113 --> 30:24.323
"Mr. wythe and
Mr. Richard Henry Lee of Virginia."

30:24.824 --> 30:27.576
And the entire delegation of New Jersey.

30:27.993 --> 30:29.829
I'm concerned over the continual absence

30:29.912 --> 30:33.040
of one-thirteenth of this congress.
Where is New Jersey?

30:33.457 --> 30:36.335
Somewhere between
New York and Pennsylvania.

30:39.839 --> 30:41.590
Thank you very much.

30:42.341 --> 30:46.137
Dr. Franklin, have you heard anything?
Your son resides there.

30:46.220 --> 30:47.471
Son, sir? What son?

30:48.431 --> 30:51.058
The royal governor of New Jersey, sir.

30:51.767 --> 30:53.769
As that title might suggest, sir,

30:53.853 --> 30:56.188
we are not in touch at the present time.

30:56.605 --> 30:58.441
Yes. Well...

30:59.024 --> 31:00.943
Now for the weather report,

31:01.026 --> 31:03.028
Mr. Jefferson of Virginia.

31:05.322 --> 31:06.323
Mr. Jefferson!

31:07.408 --> 31:08.534
Present, sir.

31:09.076 --> 31:10.703
May we hear about the weather?

31:10.995 --> 31:13.581
As if it weren't speaking for itself.

31:15.207 --> 31:17.793
Eighty-seven degrees of temperature,

31:17.877 --> 31:20.880
thirty-point-aught-six inches of Mercury.

31:21.505 --> 31:22.715
Wind...

31:23.758 --> 31:26.093
From the southwest for the rest of the day.

31:26.177 --> 31:27.636
And tonight...

31:27.720 --> 31:29.972
Tonight I'm leaving for home.

31:30.055 --> 31:31.515
On business?

31:31.599 --> 31:32.683
Family business.

31:32.933 --> 31:35.519
Give her a flourish for me, young feller.

32:03.255 --> 32:05.883
"From the commander,
army of the united colonies to New York,

32:05.966 --> 32:08.344
"dispatch number 1,137."

32:08.427 --> 32:10.596
Sweet Jesus!

32:11.096 --> 32:12.741
"To the honorable congress,
John hancock, president.

32:12.765 --> 32:16.519
"Dear sir, it is with grave apprehension
that I have learned this day

32:16.602 --> 32:18.729
"of the sailing from halifax, Nova Scotia,

32:18.813 --> 32:22.233
"of a considerable force of British troops
in the company of foreign mercenaries

32:22.316 --> 32:24.902
"and under the command
of general sir William howe."

32:24.985 --> 32:27.446
"There can be no doubt
that their destination is New York,

32:27.530 --> 32:30.699
"for to take and hold this city
and the Hudson valley beyond

32:30.783 --> 32:33.619
"would serve to separate new england
from the rest of the colonies,

32:33.702 --> 32:36.747
"permitting both sections
to be crushed in turn.

32:36.831 --> 32:39.416
"Sadly, I see no way
of stopping them at the present time,

32:39.500 --> 32:41.877
"as my army is absolutely falling apart.

32:41.961 --> 32:43.963
"My military chest is totally exhausted.

32:44.046 --> 32:47.299
"My commissary general
has strained his credit to the last.

32:47.383 --> 32:50.970
"My quartermaster has no food,
no arms, no ammunition,

32:51.095 --> 32:54.014
"and my troops are in a
state of near mutiny.

32:54.098 --> 32:58.978
"L pray god some relief arrives
before the armada, but fear it will not.

32:59.061 --> 33:00.604
"Your obedient,

33:01.981 --> 33:03.399
"g. Washington."

33:04.191 --> 33:05.734
Mr. president!

33:05.818 --> 33:06.819
Colonel mckean.

33:06.902 --> 33:09.488
Surely we have managed to promote

33:09.572 --> 33:13.701
the gloomiest man on this continent
to the head of our troops.

33:13.784 --> 33:18.080
Those dispatches
are the most depressing accumulation

33:18.163 --> 33:23.460
of disaster, doom and despair
in the entire annals of military history.

33:24.169 --> 33:26.255
Colonel mckean, please!

33:26.338 --> 33:27.339
What?

33:28.340 --> 33:29.842
It's too hot.

33:31.051 --> 33:32.803
Well, I suppose so.

33:33.679 --> 33:37.892
General Washington will continue
wording his dispatches as he sees fit.

33:37.975 --> 33:39.935
And I'm sure we all pray

33:40.019 --> 33:43.939
he finds happier thoughts
to convey in the near future.

33:45.274 --> 33:47.109
Mr. thomson, are there any resolutions?

33:47.526 --> 33:49.695
Dr. Josiah bartlett of New Hampshire.

33:50.988 --> 33:54.158
"Resolved, that for the duration
of the present hostilities,

33:54.241 --> 33:57.620
"the congress discourage
every type of extravagance and dissipation,

33:57.703 --> 34:00.331
"elaborate funerals
and other expensive diversions,

34:00.414 --> 34:03.334
"especially all horse racing, gambling,

34:03.417 --> 34:06.086
"and other forms of sinful
activity, which..."

34:06.170 --> 34:07.630
Fire wagon!

34:24.813 --> 34:26.398
Where's the fire? Can anybody tell?

34:26.482 --> 34:29.121
- Looks like the Pemberton house.
- It couldn't be. It's brand new.

34:29.193 --> 34:32.571
- It might be the city tavern.
- Bite your tongue, man.

34:41.914 --> 34:43.290
Benjy, I'm back!

34:43.916 --> 34:47.002
- L'm back, Johnny!
- Richard, lad, welcome back.

34:50.880 --> 34:51.882
Lee, is it done?

34:51.966 --> 34:53.759
First things first. Tom!

34:53.842 --> 34:58.222
Tom! Tom, your little bride wants to know,
"when's he coming home?"

34:58.305 --> 34:59.390
I leave tonight.

34:59.473 --> 35:01.016
Never mind that, man. Ls it done?

35:01.100 --> 35:03.268
Done? Why, certain-Lee.

35:04.103 --> 35:07.856
Mr. president, I have returned from
Virginia with the following resolution,

35:07.940 --> 35:11.485
"resolved, that these united colonies are,
and of a right ought to be,

35:11.568 --> 35:13.028
"free and independent states,

35:13.112 --> 35:15.823
"that they are absolved
from allegiance to the British crown,

35:15.906 --> 35:19.284
"and that all political connection between
them and the state of Great Britain is,

35:19.368 --> 35:22.037
"and ought to be, totally dissolved."

35:22.121 --> 35:23.288
Hear, hear!

35:23.372 --> 35:26.166
Mr. president, I second the proposal.

35:26.250 --> 35:28.127
The resolution has been proposed
and seconded.

35:28.210 --> 35:30.754
The chair will now entertain debate.

35:31.672 --> 35:33.298
- Mr. Dickinson.
- Mr. president.

35:33.590 --> 35:35.718
Pennsylvania moves, as always,

35:35.801 --> 35:39.930
that the question
of independence be postponed indefinitely.

35:40.014 --> 35:41.807
I second the motion.

35:42.266 --> 35:43.726
Judge Wilson,

35:44.309 --> 35:47.062
in your eagerness to be loved,
you seem to have forgotten

35:47.146 --> 35:50.107
that Pennsylvania
cannot second its own motion.

35:51.525 --> 35:53.235
Delaware seconds.

35:53.318 --> 35:55.612
You would, you lousy wart.

35:56.155 --> 35:59.324
The motion to postpone
has been moved and seconded.

35:59.408 --> 36:00.826
Mr. thomson.

36:02.327 --> 36:04.121
On the motion to postpone indefinitely

36:04.204 --> 36:07.041
the resolution on independency
or proceed with the debate,

36:07.124 --> 36:08.792
all those in favor of debate say "yea,"

36:08.876 --> 36:10.419
all those for postponement say "nay."

36:10.502 --> 36:11.587
New Hampshire?

36:12.504 --> 36:14.715
New Hampshire favors debate, and says yea.

36:17.009 --> 36:19.178
New Hampshire says yea. Massachusetts?

36:19.762 --> 36:24.266
Massachusetts, having borne the brunt
of the king's tyranny...

36:24.349 --> 36:26.351
Yes, I said tyranny!

36:27.102 --> 36:30.105
Massachusetts now,
and for all time, says yea.

36:31.690 --> 36:33.525
Massachusetts says yea.

36:33.859 --> 36:35.360
Rhode Island?

36:36.361 --> 36:37.780
Mr. Hopkins?

36:38.530 --> 36:39.907
Where's Rhode Island?

36:39.990 --> 36:42.951
Rhode Island is out visiting the necessary.

36:43.243 --> 36:46.580
After what Rhode Island's consumed,
i can't say I'm surprised.

36:46.663 --> 36:48.582
We'll come back to him, Mr. thomson.

36:48.665 --> 36:50.417
Rhode Island passes.

36:55.172 --> 36:56.298
Connecticut?

36:58.383 --> 37:00.969
While Connecticut has, till now,

37:01.053 --> 37:03.305
been against this proposal,

37:03.889 --> 37:06.350
our legislature
has instructed me that in the event

37:06.433 --> 37:09.645
it is introduced by any colony
outside of new england,

37:09.728 --> 37:13.107
we could not any longer
withhold our support. Connecticut says yea.

37:13.190 --> 37:14.316
Hear! Hear!

37:14.399 --> 37:16.735
Connecticut says yea. New York?

37:18.237 --> 37:20.656
New York abstains courteously.

37:20.906 --> 37:22.407
New York abstains.

37:22.491 --> 37:23.534
Courteously.

37:25.744 --> 37:26.829
New Jersey?

37:26.912 --> 37:28.330
Absent, Mr. secretary.

37:30.415 --> 37:32.292
New Jersey's absent. Pennsylvania?

37:33.085 --> 37:36.630
Pennsylvania, for the 24th time, says nay.

37:36.713 --> 37:38.882
Pennsylvania says nay. Delaware?

37:39.925 --> 37:44.680
Delaware, as ever for independence,
says yea.

37:44.763 --> 37:47.182
Delaware says yea. Maryland?

37:48.100 --> 37:51.478
Maryland would welcome independence
if it were given,

37:51.562 --> 37:54.773
but is highly skeptical
that it can be taken.

37:54.857 --> 37:56.525
Maryland says nay.

37:58.318 --> 38:00.529
Maryland says nay. Virginia?

38:00.612 --> 38:03.365
Virginia, the first colony, says yea!

38:06.702 --> 38:09.037
Virginia says yea. North Carolina?

38:09.121 --> 38:13.417
North Carolina
respectfully yields to south Carolina.

38:13.500 --> 38:14.543
South Carolina?

38:14.626 --> 38:16.128
Mr. president,

38:16.712 --> 38:20.257
although we of south Carolina
have never seriously considered

38:20.340 --> 38:22.551
the question of independence,

38:22.634 --> 38:26.471
when a gentleman proposes it,
attention must be paid.

38:28.098 --> 38:31.685
However, we in the deep south,

38:31.768 --> 38:33.729
unlike our friends in new england,

38:33.812 --> 38:37.441
have no cause for impatience
at the present time.

38:38.567 --> 38:41.904
If at some future date it becomes the
wish of all our sister colonies,

38:41.987 --> 38:45.908
to effect a separation,
we will not stand in the way.

38:45.991 --> 38:47.826
But for the time being,

38:47.910 --> 38:51.121
south Carolina will wait and watch.

38:52.122 --> 38:53.707
The vote is nay.

38:56.001 --> 38:57.044
North Carolina...

38:57.127 --> 38:59.463
Says nay. Yes, Mr. Hewes. I know.

39:02.090 --> 39:03.133
Georgia.

39:06.553 --> 39:07.804
Georgia.

39:09.389 --> 39:14.269
Mr. president, Georgia seems to be split
right down the middle on this issue.

39:14.353 --> 39:17.189
The people are against it, and I'm for it.

39:19.650 --> 39:22.903
However, I'm afraid I'm not quite certain

39:22.986 --> 39:27.115
whether representing the people means
relying on theirjudgment or on my own.

39:27.199 --> 39:31.912
In all fairness, until I can figure that
out, I'd better lean a little on their side.

39:31.995 --> 39:33.205
Georgia says nay.

39:37.876 --> 39:39.962
Georgia says nay.

39:40.045 --> 39:41.588
Rhode Island?

39:43.507 --> 39:45.926
Second call, Rhode Island!

39:46.551 --> 39:48.262
Rhode Island!

39:48.512 --> 39:50.973
I'm coming! I'm coming!

39:51.223 --> 39:53.350
Hold your damn horses.

39:53.433 --> 39:56.937
- We're waiting on you, Mr. Hopkins.
- Well, it won't kill you.

39:57.020 --> 40:00.482
You'd think the congress
would have its own privy.

40:00.565 --> 40:02.609
All right, where does she stand?

40:02.693 --> 40:06.530
Five for debate, five for postponement,
one abstention and one absence.

40:06.613 --> 40:08.407
So it's up to me, huh?

40:08.490 --> 40:10.534
Well, I'll tell you.

40:10.617 --> 40:15.080
In all my years,
i never seen, heard nor smelled an issue

40:15.163 --> 40:18.000
that was so dangerous
it couldn't be talked about.

40:18.083 --> 40:21.837
Hell, yes! I'm for debating anything.
Rhode Island says yea.

40:24.673 --> 40:27.926
- Mcnair, get Mr. Hopkins a rum.
- But you said...

40:28.010 --> 40:30.679
Get him the whole damn barrel if he wants.

40:31.638 --> 40:34.057
The chair now declares this congress
a committee of the whole

40:34.141 --> 40:37.561
for the purpose of debating
Virginia's resolution on independence.

40:37.644 --> 40:39.146
Mr. Dickinson.

40:41.023 --> 40:45.986
Well, now,
you've got your way at last, Mr. Adams.

40:46.361 --> 40:48.697
The matter may now be discussed.

40:49.531 --> 40:51.992
I confess I'm almost relieved.

40:52.659 --> 40:56.163
There's a question
I've been fairly itching to ask you.

40:58.540 --> 40:59.624
Why?

40:59.708 --> 41:01.918
Why what, Mr. Dickinson?

41:02.002 --> 41:04.671
Well, why independence, Mr. Adams?

41:05.172 --> 41:08.091
Well, for the obvious reason
that our continued association

41:08.175 --> 41:11.053
with Great Britain has grown intolerable.

41:11.136 --> 41:13.680
Well, to whom, Mr. Adams? To you?

41:14.639 --> 41:17.601
Well, then I suggest
you sever your ties immediately.

41:17.684 --> 41:22.898
But please be kind enough
to leave the rest of us where we are.

41:23.690 --> 41:25.692
For myself, I have no objection at all

41:25.776 --> 41:28.487
to being part of the greatest
empire on earth,

41:28.570 --> 41:31.531
to enjoying its protection
and sharing its benefits.

41:31.615 --> 41:32.866
Benefits?

41:34.076 --> 41:35.535
What benefits?

41:36.203 --> 41:39.414
Crippling taxes? Cruel repressions?

41:39.498 --> 41:41.124
Abolished rights?

41:42.876 --> 41:46.797
Is that all england means to you, sir?

41:48.924 --> 41:52.135
Is that all
the pride and affection you can muster

41:52.219 --> 41:54.638
for the nation that bore you?

41:54.721 --> 41:58.475
For the noblest, most civilized nation
on the face of this planet?

41:58.558 --> 42:02.187
Well, would you have us forsake
Hastings and magna carta,

42:02.270 --> 42:05.857
strongbow and lionheart,
Drake and marlborough,

42:05.941 --> 42:07.943
tudors, Stuarts and plantagenets?

42:08.026 --> 42:09.653
For what, sir?

42:09.736 --> 42:11.738
Well, tell me. For what?

42:14.991 --> 42:16.243
For you?

42:19.746 --> 42:23.875
Some men are patriots,
like general Washington,

42:23.959 --> 42:26.169
and some are anarchists, like Mr. paine.

42:26.253 --> 42:29.005
Some even are internationalists,
like Dr. Franklin.

42:29.089 --> 42:31.633
But you, sir...

42:33.260 --> 42:36.012
You are merely an agitator,

42:36.096 --> 42:37.514
disturbing the peace,

42:37.597 --> 42:40.058
creating disorder,
endangering the public welfare.

42:40.142 --> 42:41.518
And for what?

42:41.601 --> 42:43.895
Your petty little personal complaints.

42:43.979 --> 42:46.022
Your taxes are too high.

42:47.649 --> 42:51.403
Well, sir, so are mine.

42:54.239 --> 42:56.449
Come, come, Mr. Adams.

42:57.075 --> 43:00.453
If you have grievances,
and I'm sure you have,

43:00.537 --> 43:04.040
our present system must provide
a gentler means of redressing them

43:04.124 --> 43:06.126
short of revolution.

43:07.043 --> 43:09.212
Yes, that's what he wants.

43:09.296 --> 43:11.214
Nothing less will satisfy him.

43:11.298 --> 43:14.092
Violence, rebellion, treason.

43:16.595 --> 43:18.638
Now, Mr. Adams,

43:19.806 --> 43:22.976
are these the acts of englishmen?

43:23.059 --> 43:25.604
Not englishmen, Dickinson. Americans.

43:25.687 --> 43:27.647
No, sir. Englishmen!

43:28.440 --> 43:30.400
Please, Mr. Dickinson,
must you start banging?

43:30.483 --> 43:31.735
How is a man to sleep?

43:33.320 --> 43:36.781
Forgive me, Dr. Franklin,
but must you start speaking?

43:36.865 --> 43:38.992
How is a man to stay awake?

43:40.493 --> 43:42.579
We'll promise to be quiet, sir.

43:42.662 --> 43:45.874
I'm sure everyone prefers
that you remain asleep.

43:46.208 --> 43:48.293
If I'm to hear myself
called an englishman, sir,

43:48.376 --> 43:50.378
I assure you I prefer I'd remained asleep.

43:51.671 --> 43:54.257
Now, what's so terrible
about being called an englishman?

43:54.341 --> 43:55.884
The English don't seem to mind.

43:56.218 --> 43:59.596
Nor would I, were I given the
full rights of an englishman.

43:59.679 --> 44:03.642
But to call me one without those rights
is like calling an ox a bull.

44:03.725 --> 44:07.270
He's thankful for the honor, but he'd much
rather have restored what's rightfully his.

44:13.902 --> 44:16.696
When did you first notice
they were missing, sir?

44:22.369 --> 44:25.205
Fortunately, the people of these colonies

44:25.288 --> 44:27.916
maintain a higher regard
for their mother country.

44:28.875 --> 44:31.795
Higher, certainly, than she feels for them.

44:31.878 --> 44:36.091
Never was such a valuable possession
so stupidly and so recklessly managed

44:36.174 --> 44:39.094
than this entire continent
by the British crown.

44:39.177 --> 44:42.347
Our industry discouraged,
our resources pillaged.

44:43.598 --> 44:46.393
Worst of all, our very character stifled.

44:47.060 --> 44:49.312
We've spawned a new race here,
Mr. Dickinson.

44:49.396 --> 44:50.730
Rougher, simpler,

44:50.814 --> 44:53.441
more violent, more enterprising,

44:53.525 --> 44:54.985
less refined.

44:55.610 --> 44:57.362
We're a new nationality.

44:57.445 --> 44:59.572
We require a new nation.

45:02.867 --> 45:03.952
Well,

45:04.744 --> 45:07.205
that may be your opinion, Dr. Franklin,

45:07.289 --> 45:12.752
but, as I said,
the people feel quite differently.

45:12.836 --> 45:16.214
Now, what do you know
about the people, Dickinson?

45:16.298 --> 45:19.884
You don't speak for the people.
You represent only yourself.

45:19.968 --> 45:22.053
And that precious status quo

45:22.137 --> 45:25.515
you keep imploring the people
to preserve for their own good

45:25.598 --> 45:29.728
is nothing more than the eternal
preservation of your own property.

45:31.271 --> 45:34.024
Mr. Adams, you have an annoying talent

45:34.107 --> 45:36.192
for making such delightful words

45:36.276 --> 45:39.487
as "property" sound quite distasteful.

45:39.571 --> 45:42.490
In heaven's name,
what's wrong with property?

45:43.199 --> 45:46.328
Perhaps you've forgotten
that many of us first came to these shores

45:46.411 --> 45:49.039
in order to secure rights to property,

45:49.122 --> 45:53.376
and that we hold these rights
no less dear than the rights you speak of.

45:53.460 --> 45:57.922
Yes. So safe, so fat,
so comfortable in Pennsylvania.

45:58.006 --> 46:00.383
And what is this independence of yours

46:00.467 --> 46:03.178
except the private grievance
of Massachusetts?

46:03.261 --> 46:05.972
Why is it always Boston
that breaks the king's peace?

46:06.056 --> 46:10.435
My dear congress,
you must not adopt this evil measure.

46:10.518 --> 46:12.729
It is the work of the devil.

46:12.812 --> 46:15.148
Leave it where it belongs.

46:15.982 --> 46:17.400
In new england.

46:17.484 --> 46:21.154
Brother Dickinson, new england has been
fighting the devil for more than 100 years.

46:21.696 --> 46:26.409
And as of now, brother sherman,
the devil has been winning hands down.

46:27.077 --> 46:30.413
Why, at this very moment,
he's sitting right here in this congress.

46:30.497 --> 46:34.334
Don't let him deceive you.
This proposal is entirely his doing.

46:34.417 --> 46:36.086
It may bear Virginia's name,

46:36.169 --> 46:40.090
but it reeks of Adams,
Adams and more Adams.

46:40.173 --> 46:45.470
Look at him. Ready to lead this continent
down the fiery path of total destruction.

46:45.553 --> 46:49.682
Good god! Why can't you acknowledge
what already exists?

46:49.766 --> 46:53.269
It has been more than a year
since Concord and Lexington.

46:53.353 --> 46:55.647
Damn it, man, we're at war, right now!

46:55.730 --> 46:58.983
You may be at war.
You, Boston and John Adams.

46:59.067 --> 47:01.694
But you will never speak for Pennsylvania.

47:01.778 --> 47:02.821
Nor for Delaware.

47:02.904 --> 47:07.283
Mr. read, you represent
only one-third of Delaware.

47:07.367 --> 47:09.452
The sensible third, Mr. Rodney.

47:09.536 --> 47:12.705
Sit down, you scurvy dog,
or I'll knock you down.

47:13.540 --> 47:14.958
Sit down, all three of you!

47:15.041 --> 47:17.043
Mcnair, do something about that damn dog!

47:17.127 --> 47:18.628
And here, fetch me a rum.

47:18.711 --> 47:20.797
- Get that dog first!
- Rum, rum!

47:20.880 --> 47:22.674
I only got two hands.

47:27.512 --> 47:29.222
Christ, it's hot!

47:41.609 --> 47:43.653
Please do go on, gentlemen.

47:43.736 --> 47:46.030
You're making the only breeze
in Philadelphia.

47:47.782 --> 47:49.117
Mr. Adams,

47:49.784 --> 47:52.704
perhaps you could
clear up something for me?

47:53.371 --> 47:55.498
After we have achieved independence,

47:55.582 --> 47:58.251
who do you propose
would govern in south Carolina?

48:00.044 --> 48:01.588
The people, of course.

48:02.130 --> 48:04.966
Which people, sir?
The people of south Carolina

48:05.091 --> 48:07.385
or the people of Massachusetts?

48:07.719 --> 48:09.220
Why don't you admit it, neddy?

48:09.304 --> 48:12.223
You're against independence now
and you always will be.

48:12.307 --> 48:13.600
Aye.

48:15.727 --> 48:19.314
Gentlemen, you refuse to understand us.

48:19.397 --> 48:22.150
We desire independence. Yes.

48:23.109 --> 48:25.820
For south Carolina. That is our country.

48:27.113 --> 48:30.200
And as such,
we don't wish to belong to anyone.

48:30.283 --> 48:32.952
Not to england and not to you.

48:34.120 --> 48:36.748
We intend to have one nation, Rutledge.

48:36.831 --> 48:40.043
A nation of sovereign states, Mr. Adams.

48:40.126 --> 48:45.715
United for our mutual protection,
but separate for our individual pursuits.

48:45.798 --> 48:48.760
Now, that is what
we have understood it to be,

48:48.843 --> 48:51.638
and that is what we will support.

48:53.139 --> 48:55.642
As soon as everyone supports it.

48:59.646 --> 49:01.981
Well, there you are, Mr. Adams.

49:02.774 --> 49:05.068
You must see that we need time.

49:05.568 --> 49:10.615
Time to make certain who we are and where
we stand in regard to one another.

49:10.698 --> 49:14.661
For if we do not determine the nature
of the beast before we set it free,

49:14.744 --> 49:17.413
it will end by consuming us all.

49:17.497 --> 49:19.707
For once in your life, Wilson,

49:20.667 --> 49:22.168
take a chance.

49:23.795 --> 49:25.672
I say the time is now.

49:26.839 --> 49:28.800
It may never come again.

49:29.551 --> 49:33.304
Your clock is fast, Mr. Adams.
I say we're not yet ripe for independence.

49:33.513 --> 49:36.724
Not ripe? Hell, we're
rotting for want of it.

49:37.308 --> 49:41.187
Gentlemen, please,
what in god's name is the infernal hurry?

49:41.271 --> 49:43.273
Why must this question be settled now?

49:43.356 --> 49:45.608
What's wrong with now, Mr. chase?

49:45.858 --> 49:48.069
General Washington is in the field.

49:48.152 --> 49:52.282
If he's defeated, as it now appears,
we'll be inviting the hangman.

49:52.365 --> 49:56.452
But if, by some miracle,
he should actually win,

49:56.536 --> 49:59.247
we can then declare anything
we damn please.

49:59.330 --> 50:02.166
The sentiments of north Carolina precisely.

50:02.875 --> 50:05.003
Has it ever occurred to either of you

50:05.086 --> 50:09.549
that an army needs something
to fight for in order to win?

50:09.716 --> 50:13.136
A purpose? A goal? A flag of its own?

50:13.595 --> 50:14.929
Mr. Adams,

50:15.847 --> 50:21.185
how can a nation of only 2 million souls
stand up to an empire of 10 million?

50:21.269 --> 50:22.687
Think of it. 10 million.

50:22.770 --> 50:25.106
How do we compensate for that shortage?

50:25.189 --> 50:27.900
It's simple, Mr. chase.
Increase and multiply.

50:27.984 --> 50:29.360
How's that?

50:30.695 --> 50:33.489
We will more than compensate with spirit.

50:33.865 --> 50:36.659
I tell you, there is
a spirit out there among the people

50:36.743 --> 50:38.828
that is sadly lacking in this congress.

50:38.911 --> 50:41.956
Yes, of course. Now it's spirit.

50:42.040 --> 50:44.042
Well, why didn't I think of that?

50:44.125 --> 50:48.254
No army, no Navy, no arms, no ammunition,

50:48.338 --> 50:52.634
no treasury, no friends,

50:52.717 --> 50:55.803
but, bless our soul, spirit.

50:56.804 --> 50:59.223
Mr. Lee, Mr. Hopkins,

50:59.307 --> 51:01.726
Mr. Rodney, colonel mckean,

51:01.809 --> 51:03.311
Dr. Franklin.

51:04.604 --> 51:08.900
Why have you joined
this incendiary little man,

51:09.651 --> 51:11.736
this Boston radical,

51:13.029 --> 51:14.530
this agitator,

51:15.907 --> 51:17.450
this demagogue,

51:17.950 --> 51:19.619
this madman?

51:19.702 --> 51:22.205
Are you calling me a madman, you...

51:23.456 --> 51:24.874
You fribble!

51:27.043 --> 51:29.962
You and your Pennsylvania proprietors,

51:30.046 --> 51:33.007
you cool, considerate men,

51:33.091 --> 51:35.259
you hang to the rear on every issue,

51:35.343 --> 51:38.721
so that if we should go under,
you'll still remain afloat.

51:38.805 --> 51:40.640
Are you calling me a coward?

51:41.307 --> 51:42.975
Yes. Coward!

51:43.685 --> 51:44.727
Madman!

51:44.811 --> 51:45.895
Landlord!

51:45.978 --> 51:47.230
Lawyer!

51:53.695 --> 51:55.655
Stop it! Stop it!

51:57.448 --> 52:00.743
This is the congress. Stop it, I say!

52:00.827 --> 52:02.078
The enemy's out there.

52:02.161 --> 52:03.830
No, Mr. Rodney, the enemy is here.

52:03.913 --> 52:06.749
No. I say he's out there.

52:06.833 --> 52:08.459
England.

52:08.543 --> 52:12.046
England closing in, cutting off our air.

52:12.130 --> 52:13.715
There's no time!

52:17.301 --> 52:18.511
No air.

52:19.846 --> 52:21.139
Dr. hall.

52:25.226 --> 52:26.728
Colonel mckean.

52:26.811 --> 52:28.604
Aye. It's the cancer.

52:29.731 --> 52:31.607
But he should go home.

52:32.608 --> 52:35.820
A man should die in his own bed.

52:37.488 --> 52:39.699
John. John Adams.

52:39.782 --> 52:41.409
I'm here, Caesar.

52:44.203 --> 52:46.289
I leave you

52:46.372 --> 52:48.666
a divided Delaware.

52:49.917 --> 52:51.294
Forgive me.

52:52.003 --> 52:54.088
I'll take you home, Caesar.

53:18.905 --> 53:21.115
I'll be back within the week.

53:28.706 --> 53:32.126
Mr. president,
south Carolina calls the question.

53:34.170 --> 53:35.379
What's that, Mr. Rutledge?

53:36.589 --> 53:38.633
I said, Mr. president,

53:38.716 --> 53:42.136
south Carolina desires to end the debate

53:43.763 --> 53:46.182
and calls the question of independence.

53:46.265 --> 53:48.476
- Delaware seconds.
- Thank you.

53:49.936 --> 53:52.980
Gentlemen, please!

53:53.064 --> 53:55.900
The question has been called and seconded.

53:56.984 --> 53:59.028
The secretary will record the vote.

53:59.111 --> 54:01.447
Franklin, do something. Think.

54:01.531 --> 54:03.533
I'm thinking, but nothing's coming.

54:03.616 --> 54:05.743
All those in favor
of the resolution on independence

54:05.827 --> 54:08.371
as proposed by the colony of Virginia,
signify by saying...

54:08.454 --> 54:09.956
Mr. secretary.

54:10.748 --> 54:12.708
Will you please read the resolution again?

54:12.792 --> 54:13.918
What?

54:15.127 --> 54:16.295
I've forgotten it.

54:16.379 --> 54:17.964
Now, Benjamin...

54:20.466 --> 54:23.177
"Resolved, that these united colonies are,

54:23.261 --> 54:25.888
"and of a right ought to be,
free and independent..."

54:32.270 --> 54:35.857
Excuse me.
Ls this the continental congress?

54:35.940 --> 54:38.526
Yes, I can see that it must be.

54:39.735 --> 54:41.863
It's all right. We found it.

54:42.363 --> 54:44.740
We've been looking
for you everywhere, you see.

54:44.824 --> 54:47.451
Someone told us
that you might be at carpenters' hall

54:47.535 --> 54:50.162
and someone else suggested library hall,
and...

54:50.246 --> 54:51.914
So, finally, we asked a constable...

54:51.998 --> 54:53.082
Excuse me, sir,

54:53.165 --> 54:56.252
but, if you don't mind,
the congress is about to decide

54:56.335 --> 54:58.337
the question of American independence.

54:59.463 --> 55:01.841
How splendid. That means
we're not too late.

55:01.924 --> 55:04.176
These gentlemen are Mr. Francis hopkinson,

55:04.260 --> 55:08.014
Mr. Richard stockton,
and I'm the reverend John Witherspoon.

55:11.392 --> 55:13.686
We're the new delegates from New Jersey.

55:13.936 --> 55:15.313
New Jersey?

55:19.525 --> 55:20.985
Dr. Franklin,

55:21.444 --> 55:25.072
I regret that I must be the bearer
of unhappy tidings, sir,

55:25.156 --> 55:27.950
but your son,
the royal governor of New Jersey,

55:28.034 --> 55:29.952
has been taken prisoner

55:30.036 --> 55:34.040
and has been moved under guard to the
colony of Connecticut for safekeeping.

55:34.123 --> 55:35.458
Is he unharmed, sir?

55:35.541 --> 55:37.335
When last I heard, he was. Yes, sir.

55:37.418 --> 55:41.130
Well, then why the long face? I hear
Connecticut is an excellent location.

55:41.213 --> 55:44.300
Tell me.
Why did they arrest the little bastard?

55:46.552 --> 55:47.678
Our...

55:48.262 --> 55:51.849
New Jersey legislature has recalled
the old delegation to this congress

55:51.933 --> 55:54.602
and has sent a new one.

55:55.561 --> 55:57.813
Quickly, man,
where do you stand on independence?

55:57.897 --> 55:59.607
- Well, haven't I made that clear?
- No.

55:59.690 --> 56:01.025
Well, I suppose I haven't.

56:01.108 --> 56:02.944
But that's the reason for the change.

56:03.027 --> 56:05.404
See, we've been instructed
to vote for independence.

56:05.488 --> 56:06.822
Mr. president!

56:06.906 --> 56:11.327
Massachusetts is now ready
for the vote on independence,

56:11.410 --> 56:15.831
and reminds the chair of its privilege
to decide all votes that are deadlocked.

56:15.915 --> 56:17.917
I won't forget, Mr. Adams.

56:19.377 --> 56:23.339
The chair takes this opportunity
to welcome the New Jersey delegation

56:23.422 --> 56:26.759
and appoints the reverend Witherspoon
congressional chaplain

56:26.842 --> 56:28.344
if he will accept the post.

56:28.427 --> 56:30.388
With much pleasure, sir.

56:32.348 --> 56:37.520
Very well. Mr. thomson, you may
now proceed with the vote on independence.

56:38.479 --> 56:40.690
All in favor
of the resolution on independence

56:40.773 --> 56:43.043
as proposed by the colony of Virginia,
signify by saying...

56:43.067 --> 56:44.110
Mr. president.

56:45.861 --> 56:49.991
Pennsylvania moves
that any vote in favor of independence

56:51.409 --> 56:53.202
must be unanimous.

56:53.869 --> 56:54.912
What?

56:55.371 --> 56:56.706
I second the motion.

56:56.789 --> 56:58.207
Judge Wilson!

56:58.624 --> 56:59.959
Oh, my god.

57:00.584 --> 57:02.253
Delaware seconds, Mr. president.

57:02.336 --> 57:05.006
No vote has ever had to be unanimous,
Dickinson, and you know it.

57:05.089 --> 57:07.550
- Yes, but this one must be.
- On what grounds?

57:07.633 --> 57:11.345
That no colony be torn from
its mother country without its own consent.

57:11.429 --> 57:12.805
Hear! Hear!

57:13.222 --> 57:16.100
But it will never be unanimous, damn it.

57:17.101 --> 57:19.311
If you say so, Mr. Adams.

57:21.188 --> 57:24.358
It has been moved and seconded
that the vote on independence

57:24.442 --> 57:26.736
must be unanimous in order to carry.

57:26.819 --> 57:29.321
All those in favor, signify by saying yea.

57:29.405 --> 57:30.406
Yea!

57:30.489 --> 57:34.994
One, two, three, four, five, six.

57:35.077 --> 57:37.371
Six colonies say yea. Against?

57:37.455 --> 57:38.539
Nay!

57:38.622 --> 57:43.002
One, two, three, four, five, six.

57:43.252 --> 57:45.046
Six colonies say nay.

57:46.088 --> 57:50.760
Mr. secretary,
New York abstains courteously.

57:50.843 --> 57:55.264
Mr. Morris,
why does New York constantly abstain?

57:55.347 --> 57:58.267
Why doesn't New York
simply stay in New York?

57:59.685 --> 58:01.812
Very well. The vote is tied.

58:03.064 --> 58:06.484
The principles of independence
have no greater advocate in congress

58:06.567 --> 58:08.319
than its president.

58:08.861 --> 58:12.198
That is why I must join those
who vote for unanimity.

58:12.948 --> 58:15.409
Good god, John!
What are you doing? You've sunk us.

58:15.493 --> 58:17.203
Now, hear me out.

58:17.286 --> 58:19.789
Don't you see that any colony
who opposes independence

58:19.872 --> 58:21.683
will be forced to fight
on the side of england?

58:21.707 --> 58:24.460
That we'll be setting
brother against brother,

58:24.543 --> 58:28.380
that our new nation will carry
as its emblem the mark of Cain.

58:29.215 --> 58:30.841
I can see no other way.

58:30.925 --> 58:35.054
Either we all walk together,
or together we must stay where we are.

58:37.098 --> 58:38.808
The man's from Massachusetts.

58:38.891 --> 58:41.102
Very well. Proceed, Mr. thomson.

58:41.185 --> 58:43.771
A unanimous vote being necessary to carry,

58:43.854 --> 58:46.357
if any be opposed
to the resolution on independence

58:46.440 --> 58:48.567
as proposed by the colony of Virginia,
signify by...

58:48.651 --> 58:49.652
Mr. president.

58:49.735 --> 58:52.363
For heaven's sake,
let me get through it once.

58:52.446 --> 58:53.948
Mr. president.

58:55.241 --> 58:56.742
I move for a postponement.

58:56.826 --> 58:57.993
Postponement?

58:58.077 --> 58:59.954
I wish you the same luck I had with it.

59:00.037 --> 59:01.997
Mr. Adams is right. We need a postponement.

59:02.081 --> 59:03.374
On what grounds?

59:03.457 --> 59:05.084
On what grounds?

59:05.626 --> 59:09.922
Mr. president, how can this congress vote
onindependence

59:10.005 --> 59:14.885
without a written declaration
of some sort defining it?

59:16.595 --> 59:18.514
What sort of declaration?

59:20.099 --> 59:24.186
Well, you know,
listing the reasons for the separation,

59:24.270 --> 59:27.273
our purposes, goals, so forth, so on.

59:27.356 --> 59:29.733
- Ditto, ditto.
- Ditto, ditto, et cetera, et cetera.

59:29.817 --> 59:31.318
We know those, don't we?

59:33.654 --> 59:35.781
Yes, good god, we know them,

59:36.782 --> 59:39.034
but what about the rest of the world?

59:39.118 --> 59:41.537
Certainly we require the assistance

59:41.620 --> 59:45.207
of a powerful nation
such as France or Spain.

59:45.291 --> 59:49.795
And such a written declaration
would be consistent with European delicacy.

59:51.297 --> 59:54.550
Come now, Mr. Adams.
You'll have to do better than that.

59:54.633 --> 59:57.553
Answer straight. What would be its purpose?

59:58.512 --> 01:00:00.556
Yes. Well...

01:00:03.392 --> 01:00:07.521
To place before mankind
the common sense of the subject

01:00:08.439 --> 01:00:11.150
in terms so plain and firm

01:00:11.775 --> 01:00:13.861
as to command their assent.

01:00:21.577 --> 01:00:24.747
Mr. Jefferson, are you seriously suggesting

01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:27.791
that we publish a paper
declaring to all the world

01:00:27.875 --> 01:00:32.171
that an illegal rebellion
is, in reality, a legal one?

01:00:32.254 --> 01:00:35.090
Mr. Dickinson, I'm surprised at you.

01:00:35.174 --> 01:00:37.927
You should know that rebellion
is always legal in the first person,

01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:39.720
such as "our rebellion."

01:00:39.803 --> 01:00:42.765
It's only in the third person, "their
rebellion," that it is illegal.

01:00:45.059 --> 01:00:47.269
Mr. president, I second the motion

01:00:47.353 --> 01:00:49.104
to postpone the vote on independence

01:00:49.188 --> 01:00:53.025
for a period of time sufficient
for the writing of a declaration.

01:00:53.359 --> 01:00:55.361
It has been moved and seconded.
Mr. thomson.

01:00:55.444 --> 01:00:58.948
All those in favor of the motion to
postpone, signify by saying yea.

01:00:59.031 --> 01:01:00.532
Yea!

01:01:00.616 --> 01:01:04.870
One, two, three, four, five, six.

01:01:04.954 --> 01:01:06.914
Six colonies say yea. Against?

01:01:06.997 --> 01:01:07.998
Nay!

01:01:08.082 --> 01:01:12.336
One, two, three, four, five, six.

01:01:12.753 --> 01:01:14.546
Six colonies say nay.

01:01:16.966 --> 01:01:20.761
Mr. secretary,
New York abstains courteously.

01:01:25.391 --> 01:01:28.852
Mr. Morris, what in hell
goes on in New York?

01:01:29.853 --> 01:01:33.399
I'm sorry, Mr. president,
but the simple fact is that

01:01:33.482 --> 01:01:37.903
our legislature has never
sent us explicit instructions on anything.

01:01:38.946 --> 01:01:40.114
Never?

01:01:41.448 --> 01:01:43.117
That's impossible.

01:01:44.785 --> 01:01:49.790
Mr. president, have you ever been present
at a meeting of the New York legislature?

01:01:50.374 --> 01:01:52.626
They speak very fast and very loud,

01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:55.254
and nobody listens to anybody else

01:01:55.337 --> 01:01:58.257
with the result that
nothing ever gets done.

01:02:00.843 --> 01:02:02.928
I beg the congress' pardon.

01:02:05.222 --> 01:02:07.266
My sympathies, Mr. Morris.

01:02:07.933 --> 01:02:11.687
The vote again being tied,
the chair decides in favor of postponement.

01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:13.522
So ruled.

01:02:13.605 --> 01:02:15.750
A committee will now be formed
to manage the declaration.

01:02:15.774 --> 01:02:18.736
Said document to be written,
debated, approved by the beginning of July,

01:02:18.819 --> 01:02:20.571
some three weeks hence.

01:02:20.654 --> 01:02:25.534
At which time, Virginia's resolution
on independence will finally be voted.

01:02:25.617 --> 01:02:27.119
Is that clear?

01:02:27.953 --> 01:02:31.206
Very well. Will the following gentlemen
serve on the declaration committee,

01:02:31.290 --> 01:02:33.042
- Dr. Franklin?
- Gladly.

01:02:33.417 --> 01:02:35.294
- Mr. John Adams?
- Yes.

01:02:35.419 --> 01:02:36.503
Mr. sherman?

01:02:37.504 --> 01:02:39.298
- Mr. Livingston?
- Right.

01:02:39.381 --> 01:02:41.258
And, of course, Mr. Lee.

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:45.596
Excuse me, but I must be returning
to the sovereign colony of Virginia

01:02:45.679 --> 01:02:48.098
as I have been asked to serve as governor.

01:02:48.182 --> 01:02:51.810
And therefore I must
decline respectful-Lee.

01:02:56.648 --> 01:02:58.776
Very well, Mr. Lee, you're excused then.

01:02:58.859 --> 01:03:01.362
I suppose we could leave it
a four-man committee.

01:03:01.445 --> 01:03:03.739
Just a moment.
This business needs a virginian.

01:03:03.822 --> 01:03:05.449
Therefore I propose a replacement.

01:03:05.532 --> 01:03:07.326
- Mr. Thomas Jefferson.
- No. Mr. Adams...

01:03:07.409 --> 01:03:09.578
Very well, Mr. Adams.
Mr. Jefferson will serve.

01:03:09.661 --> 01:03:12.331
- L'm going home, too, to my wife.
- Move to adjourn!

01:03:12.414 --> 01:03:13.499
- Wait.
- Lsecond.

01:03:13.582 --> 01:03:17.252
Mr. hancock,
i haven't seen her for six months.

01:03:17.336 --> 01:03:19.213
Moved and seconded. Any objections?

01:03:19.296 --> 01:03:21.382
I have objections. I
have lots of objections.

01:03:21.465 --> 01:03:23.675
So ruled! Congress stands adjourned!

01:03:23.759 --> 01:03:26.095
John, I need to see my wife.

01:03:26.178 --> 01:03:27.805
It's all right. Come along, come along.

01:03:27.888 --> 01:03:29.848
No. I'm going home tonight.

01:03:29.932 --> 01:03:31.517
Of course you are. Of course.

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:34.478
Mcnair, some rum up to my office.

01:03:36.021 --> 01:03:38.023
Don't worry, tom.

01:03:38.107 --> 01:03:39.775
Let me handle it.

01:03:39.858 --> 01:03:41.693
I'll get Adams to write it.

01:03:41.777 --> 01:03:44.154
I don't know.
He had a funny look on his face.

01:03:44.238 --> 01:03:45.364
He always does.

01:03:45.447 --> 01:03:46.740
All right, gentlemen,

01:03:46.824 --> 01:03:48.409
let's get on with it.

01:03:48.492 --> 01:03:51.495
Which of us will write
our declaration of independence?

01:03:53.163 --> 01:03:56.166
<i>Mr. Adams, I say you should write it</i>

01:03:57.042 --> 01:03:59.670
<i>to your legal mind and brilliance we defer</i>

01:03:59.753 --> 01:04:03.006
<i>ls that so? Well, if I'm the one to do it</i>

01:04:03.090 --> 01:04:04.967
<i>they'll run their quill pens through it</i>

01:04:05.050 --> 01:04:07.553
<i>I'm obnoxious and disliked
you know that, sir</i>

01:04:07.636 --> 01:04:08.637
<i>yes, I know</i>

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:11.432
<i>but I say you should
write it, Franklin, yes you</i>

01:04:11.515 --> 01:04:12.599
<i>hell no!</i>

01:04:12.683 --> 01:04:15.269
<i>Yes, you, Dr. Franklin, you</i>

01:04:15.352 --> 01:04:16.353
<i>- but...
- You!</i>

01:04:16.437 --> 01:04:17.479
<i>- But...
- You!</i>

01:04:17.563 --> 01:04:19.106
<i>But...</i>

01:04:21.233 --> 01:04:24.445
<i>Mr. Adams, but, Mr. Adams</i>

01:04:24.903 --> 01:04:28.157
<i>the things I write
are only light extemporanea</i>

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:32.119
<i>I won't put politics on paper, it's a mania</i>

01:04:32.202 --> 01:04:36.039
<i>so I refuse to use the pen in Pennsylvania</i>

01:04:36.123 --> 01:04:37.833
<i>Pennsylvania</i>

01:04:37.916 --> 01:04:40.002
<i>Pennsylvania</i>

01:04:40.085 --> 01:04:43.422
<i>refuse to use the pen</i>

01:04:54.683 --> 01:04:58.061
<i>Mr. sherman, I say you should write it</i>

01:04:58.145 --> 01:05:00.856
<i>you are never controversial as it were</i>

01:05:00.939 --> 01:05:01.982
<i>that is true</i>

01:05:02.065 --> 01:05:04.109
<i>whereas if I'm the one to do it</i>

01:05:04.193 --> 01:05:05.903
<i>they'll run their quill pens through it</i>

01:05:05.986 --> 01:05:08.363
<i>I'm obnoxious and disliked

01:05:08.447 --> 01:05:09.448
<i>yes, I do</i>

01:05:09.531 --> 01:05:12.034
<i>so I say you should write
it, Roger, yes, you</i>

01:05:12.117 --> 01:05:13.368
<i>good heavens, no</i>

01:05:13.452 --> 01:05:15.496
<i>yes, you, Roger sherman</i>

01:05:15.579 --> 01:05:16.580
<i>- you!
- But“...</i>

01:05:16.663 --> 01:05:17.664
<i>- You!
- But“...</i>

01:05:17.748 --> 01:05:20.167
<i>- You!
- But“...</i>

01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:25.130
<i>Mr. Adams, but, Mr. Adams</i>

01:05:25.214 --> 01:05:29.009
<i>I cannot write
with any style or proper etiquette</i>

01:05:29.092 --> 01:05:32.554
<i>I don't know a participle from a predicate</i>

01:05:32.638 --> 01:05:35.641
<i>I am just a simple cobbler from Connecticut</i>

01:05:36.517 --> 01:05:38.352
<i>Connecticut</i>

01:05:38.435 --> 01:05:40.062
<i>Connecticut</i>

01:05:40.145 --> 01:05:43.899
<i>a simple cobbler, he</i>

01:05:54.618 --> 01:05:57.996
<i>Mr. Livingston, maybe you should write it</i>

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:00.707
<i>you have many friends and you're a diplomat</i>

01:06:00.791 --> 01:06:01.792
<i>oh, that word</i>

01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:03.794
<i>whereas if I'm the one to do it</i>

01:06:03.877 --> 01:06:05.462
<i>they'll run their quill pens through it</i>

01:06:05.546 --> 01:06:07.965
<i>he's obnoxious and disliked

01:06:08.048 --> 01:06:09.091
<i>I hadn't heard</i>

01:06:09.174 --> 01:06:11.718
<i>so I say you should write
it, Robert, yes, you</i>

01:06:11.843 --> 01:06:12.886
<i>not me, Johnny</i>

01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:15.097
<i>yes, you, Robert Livingston</i>

01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:16.181

<i>- You!

01:06:21.979 --> 01:06:25.274
<i>Mr. Adams, dear Mr. Adams</i>

01:06:25.357 --> 01:06:28.944
<i>I've been presented

<i>Mr. Adams</i>

01:06:59.016 --> 01:07:02.436
<i>leave me alone</i>

01:07:04.438 --> 01:07:06.648
- Mr. Jefferson...
- Mr. Adams, I beg of you.

01:07:06.732 --> 01:07:10.193
I've not seen my wife
these past six months.

01:07:10.277 --> 01:07:13.780
"And we solemnly declare
that we will preserve our liberties,

01:07:13.864 --> 01:07:18.702
"being with one mind resolved to die
free men rather than to live slaves."

01:07:18.785 --> 01:07:23.749
Thomas Jefferson,
"on the necessity of taking up arms," 1775.

01:07:23.832 --> 01:07:25.000
Magnificent.

01:07:25.751 --> 01:07:28.837
You write 10 times better
than any man in congress,

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:30.631
including me.

01:07:30.714 --> 01:07:32.799
For a man of only 33 years,

01:07:32.883 --> 01:07:36.470
you possess a happy talent for composition

01:07:36.553 --> 01:07:39.431
and a remarkable Felicity of expression.

01:07:40.223 --> 01:07:43.352
Now, then, sir. Will you be a patriot

01:07:43.435 --> 01:07:44.770
or a lover?

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:47.731
A lover.

01:07:48.523 --> 01:07:50.025
No.

01:07:50.108 --> 01:07:52.152
But I burn, Mr. a.

01:07:52.235 --> 01:07:54.404
So do I, Mr. j.

01:07:55.238 --> 01:07:56.907
- You?
- You do?

01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:58.492
- John.
- Who'd have thought it?

01:08:00.494 --> 01:08:02.537
<i>Mr. Jefferson</i>

01:08:02.621 --> 01:08:04.956

<i>I'm only 41, I still have my virility</i>

<i>and I can romp
through cupid's grove with great agility</i>

01:08:17.469 --> 01:08:22.724
<i>but life is more than sexual combustibility</i>

01:08:22.808 --> 01:08:23.928
Jefferson, stop right there.

01:08:23.975 --> 01:08:25.060
<i>'Bustability</i>

01:08:25.143 --> 01:08:27.229

01:08:28.814 --> 01:08:30.148
Quiet!

01:08:34.486 --> 01:08:36.613
Now, you'll write it, Mr. j.

01:08:37.154 --> 01:08:39.157
Who will make me, Mr. a.?

01:08:40.075 --> 01:08:41.076
.3

01:08:41.993 --> 01:08:43.078
<i>You'?</i>

01:08:43.662 --> 01:08:44.830
Yes.

01:08:48.959 --> 01:08:50.001
How?

01:08:51.795 --> 01:08:54.673
By physical force, if necessary.

01:08:55.674 --> 01:08:58.343
It's your duty, damn it. Your duty!

01:09:00.595 --> 01:09:02.889
<i>Mr. Adams</i>

01:09:02.973 --> 01:09:05.225
<i>damn you, Mr. Adams</i>

01:09:06.435 --> 01:09:09.187
<i>you're obnoxious and disliked</i>

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:11.606
<i>that cannot be denied</i>

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:18.279

<i>oh, Mr. Adams,
you are driving me to homicide</i>

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.160
Jefferson, stop right there!

01:09:30.207 --> 01:09:31.209
<i>Homicide</i>

01:09:31.292 --> 01:09:32.294
<i>homicide</i>

01:09:32.377 --> 01:09:33.837
quiet!

01:09:39.259 --> 01:09:41.219
The decision is yours, Mr. Jefferson.

01:09:41.303 --> 01:09:43.220
Do as you like with it.

01:09:47.225 --> 01:09:53.857
<i>We may see murder yet</i>

01:10:02.866 --> 01:10:04.326
damn the man.

01:10:07.287 --> 01:10:08.914
God damn the man.

01:10:56.837 --> 01:10:58.004
Sorry.

01:11:00.841 --> 01:11:03.593
- Pardon me, sir.
- Step aside. Step aside.

01:11:04.427 --> 01:11:06.304
- How are you?
- Franklin.

01:11:12.936 --> 01:11:14.271
Jefferson!

01:11:17.482 --> 01:11:18.817
Jefferson!

01:11:21.278 --> 01:11:22.571
What is that racket?

01:11:22.654 --> 01:11:24.739
Latest thing from Europe, John.
It's called music.

01:11:24.823 --> 01:11:28.285
I came here
hoping to hear a pen scratching, not a bow.

01:11:30.662 --> 01:11:33.081
Jefferson! I know you're in there!

01:11:35.250 --> 01:11:37.377
Jefferson, are you finished?

01:11:39.337 --> 01:11:41.339
Well, is it written yet?

01:11:44.217 --> 01:11:46.761
Well, you've had a whole week, man.

01:11:46.845 --> 01:11:48.221
Is it done?

01:11:49.973 --> 01:11:51.433
Can I see it?

01:11:59.024 --> 01:12:01.544
"There comes a time in the lives of men
when it becomes necessary

01:12:01.568 --> 01:12:04.779
"to advance from that subordination
in which they have hitherto..."

01:12:04.863 --> 01:12:06.531
This is terrible.

01:12:07.198 --> 01:12:08.199
Where's the rest of it?

01:12:14.497 --> 01:12:17.876
Do you mean to say
that it is not yet finished?

01:12:18.793 --> 01:12:19.961
No, sir.

01:12:20.045 --> 01:12:22.672
I mean to say that it's not yet begun.

01:12:23.381 --> 01:12:24.925
Good god!

01:12:26.259 --> 01:12:27.719
A whole week.

01:12:28.845 --> 01:12:31.890
The entire earth was created in a week.

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:39.105
Someday you must tell me how you did it.

01:12:42.150 --> 01:12:43.902
Disgusting.

01:12:44.819 --> 01:12:46.404
Look at him, Franklin.

01:12:46.488 --> 01:12:48.698
Virginia's most famous lover.

01:12:49.616 --> 01:12:51.284
Virginia abstains.

01:12:55.288 --> 01:12:57.123
Well, cheer up, Jefferson.

01:12:57.207 --> 01:12:59.185
Get out of the clumps.
It'll come out all right, I assure you.

01:12:59.209 --> 01:13:01.586
Now, get back to work.

01:13:02.337 --> 01:13:04.965
Franklin, tell him to get back to work.

01:13:05.048 --> 01:13:06.800
I think he's asleep.

01:13:09.886 --> 01:13:11.554
Wake up, Franklin!

01:13:15.892 --> 01:13:19.104
Hello! And whose little girl are you?

01:13:22.899 --> 01:13:24.693
John, who is she?

01:13:24.776 --> 01:13:26.194
His wife.

01:13:27.278 --> 01:13:28.446
Ihope.

01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:31.658
What makes you think so?

01:13:31.741 --> 01:13:33.618
Because I sent for her.

01:13:34.744 --> 01:13:35.787
You what?

01:13:35.870 --> 01:13:38.474
Well, it simply occurred to me
that the sooner his problem was solved,

01:13:38.498 --> 01:13:40.542
the sooner our problem is solved.

01:13:40.625 --> 01:13:43.378
That's good thinking, John. Good thinking.

01:13:43.461 --> 01:13:46.464
Madam, may I present myself? John Adams.

01:13:49.509 --> 01:13:50.635
Adams.

01:13:52.303 --> 01:13:53.680
John Adams.

01:13:54.973 --> 01:13:57.142
And Dr. Franklin.

01:13:59.436 --> 01:14:01.563
The inventor of the stove.

01:14:06.151 --> 01:14:08.987
Jefferson, kindly present me to your wife.

01:14:11.865 --> 01:14:13.867
She is your wife, isn't she?

01:14:13.950 --> 01:14:15.870
Well, of course she is.
Look at the way they fit.

01:14:18.997 --> 01:14:20.331
Come along, John, come along.

01:14:20.415 --> 01:14:23.084
- Franklin, where are you going?
- Come along, John.

01:14:23.668 --> 01:14:25.503
Come along where? There's work to be done.

01:14:25.587 --> 01:14:26.921
Obviously.

01:14:27.630 --> 01:14:30.717
Good god. You don't mean to say that...

01:14:31.968 --> 01:14:34.262
I mean, they're not going to...

01:14:35.055 --> 01:14:37.682
In the middle of the afternoon?

01:14:37.766 --> 01:14:40.185
Not everybody's from Boston, John.

01:14:41.352 --> 01:14:43.104
Incredible.

01:14:43.188 --> 01:14:44.939
Well, goodbye, John.

01:14:45.857 --> 01:14:47.358
Franklin?

01:14:48.485 --> 01:14:50.278
- Have you eaten?
- Not yet, but...

01:14:50.361 --> 01:14:52.361
I understand
the Turkey's fresh at bunch of grapes.

01:14:52.530 --> 01:14:55.450
Well, the fact is I have
a rendezvous, John.

01:14:55.533 --> 01:14:58.703
I'd ask you along,
but talking makes her nervous.

01:15:01.414 --> 01:15:02.957
Yes, of course.

01:15:22.811 --> 01:15:24.229
Incredible.

01:15:32.237 --> 01:15:33.488
Abigail?

01:15:34.823 --> 01:15:36.825
I'm very lonely, Abigail.

01:15:37.575 --> 01:15:38.952
<i>Are you, John?</i>

01:15:39.035 --> 01:15:42.497
<i>As long as you were sending for wives,
why didn't you send for your own?</i>

01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:45.500
Now, don't be unreasonable, Abigail.

01:15:45.583 --> 01:15:47.418
<i>Now I'm unreasonable.</i>

01:15:47.752 --> 01:15:50.088
<i>You must add that to your list.</i>

01:15:51.256 --> 01:15:52.674
List?

01:15:52.757 --> 01:15:55.927
The catalog of my faults
you included in your last letter.

01:15:57.554 --> 01:16:01.141
They were fondly intended, madam.

01:16:01.224 --> 01:16:02.851
That I play at cards badly?

01:16:02.934 --> 01:16:04.352
A compliment.

01:16:04.435 --> 01:16:06.229
That my posture is crooked?

01:16:06.855 --> 01:16:08.857
An endearment.

01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:10.817
That I read, write and think too much?

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:12.944
An irony.

01:16:13.027 --> 01:16:14.404
That I'm pigeon-toed?

01:16:17.073 --> 01:16:19.492
Well, now there you have me, Abby.

01:16:21.119 --> 01:16:22.996
I'm afraid you are pigeon-toed.

01:16:25.415 --> 01:16:29.335
Please. Come to Philadelphia. Please come.

01:16:29.878 --> 01:16:32.005
Thank you, John.

01:16:32.088 --> 01:16:34.549
I do want to,
but you know now it's not possible.

01:16:34.632 --> 01:16:35.832
The children have the measles.

01:16:36.593 --> 01:16:38.052
So you wrote.

01:16:39.804 --> 01:16:41.222
Tom and little Abby.

01:16:41.764 --> 01:16:44.142
Only now it's Quincy and Charles.

01:16:46.561 --> 01:16:49.814
And it appears the farm here
in braintree is failing, John.

01:16:51.191 --> 01:16:53.943
The chickens and the geese have all died.

01:16:54.402 --> 01:16:57.447
The apples never survived the late frost.

01:16:59.199 --> 01:17:02.035
How do you suppose
she managed to get away?

01:17:03.077 --> 01:17:05.872
Well, the winters are softer in Virginia.

01:17:06.456 --> 01:17:08.333
And their women, John?

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:10.835
Fit for virginians, madam,

01:17:10.919 --> 01:17:14.255
but pale, puny things
beside new england girls.

01:17:14.881 --> 01:17:16.049
John.

01:17:17.842 --> 01:17:19.636
I thank you for that.

01:17:23.598 --> 01:17:26.184
Abigail, how goes it with you?

01:17:26.768 --> 01:17:28.978
Not well, John. Not at all well.

01:17:30.313 --> 01:17:33.900
<i>I live like a nun in a cloister</i>

01:17:33.983 --> 01:17:38.112
<i>solitary, celibate i hate it</i>

01:17:38.196 --> 01:17:39.948
and you, John?

01:17:40.031 --> 01:17:44.160
<i>I live like a monk in an Abbey</i>

01:17:44.244 --> 01:17:46.663
<i>ditto, ditto i hate it</i>

01:17:48.081 --> 01:17:55.004
<i>write to me with sentimental effusion</i>

01:17:56.047 --> 01:18:02.720
<i>let me revel in romantic illusion</i>

01:18:04.722 --> 01:18:11.437
<i>do you still smell of
vanilla and spring air?</i>

01:18:13.231 --> 01:18:16.943
<i>And is my favorite lover's pillow</i>

01:18:17.026 --> 01:18:20.405
<i>still firm and fair?</i>

01:18:21.614 --> 01:18:26.995
<i>What was there, John</i>

01:18:27.078 --> 01:18:33.710
<i>still is there, John</i>

01:18:34.877 --> 01:18:39.007
<i>come soon as you can to my cloister</i>

01:18:39.090 --> 01:18:43.469
<i>I've forgotten the feel of your hand</i>

01:18:43.928 --> 01:18:48.641
<i>soon, madam, we shall walk
in cupid's grove together</i>

01:18:48.725 --> 01:18:55.064
<i>- and we'll fondly survey

01:18:55.148 --> 01:19:01.529

01:19:47.992 --> 01:19:49.660
John?

01:19:49.744 --> 01:19:50.745
John!

01:19:50.828 --> 01:19:51.913
What?

01:19:51.996 --> 01:19:53.015
What are you doing down here?

01:19:53.039 --> 01:19:54.999
I thought you'd be up there,
cracking the whip.

01:19:55.083 --> 01:19:58.378
Well, the shutters are still closed.

01:19:59.670 --> 01:20:01.506
My word! So they are.

01:20:03.883 --> 01:20:05.009
Well, as the French say...

01:20:05.093 --> 01:20:07.136
Please, Franklin!

01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:10.556
Spare me your bawdy mind
first thing in the morning.

01:20:11.766 --> 01:20:12.850
Dare we call?

01:20:13.059 --> 01:20:15.269
A congressman dares anything.

01:20:15.353 --> 01:20:17.188
- Go ahead.
- Me?

01:20:17.271 --> 01:20:19.399
Your voice is more piercing.

01:20:21.818 --> 01:20:24.362
John, look at her. Just look at her.

01:20:24.445 --> 01:20:25.655
Lam.

01:20:25.738 --> 01:20:28.658
She's even more magnificent
than I remember.

01:20:30.159 --> 01:20:32.870
Of course, we didn't see
much of her front last night.

01:20:32.954 --> 01:20:34.205
Good morrow, madam.

01:20:34.288 --> 01:20:35.706
Good morrow.

01:20:38.251 --> 01:20:42.171
Is it the habit in Philadelphia for strangers
to shout at ladies from the street?

01:20:42.255 --> 01:20:43.464
Not really, but...

01:20:43.548 --> 01:20:48.010
And for men of your age
it is not only unseemly, it is unsightly.

01:20:49.220 --> 01:20:52.432
Excuse me, madam, but we met last evening.

01:20:53.558 --> 01:20:55.226
I spoke to no one last evening.

01:20:55.309 --> 01:20:56.561
Indeed, you did not.

01:20:56.644 --> 01:20:59.313
Nonetheless, we did present ourselves.

01:20:59.397 --> 01:21:02.358
This is Mr. John Adams.
I'm Dr. Benjamin Franklin.

01:21:03.776 --> 01:21:05.194
The inventor of the stove.

01:21:07.238 --> 01:21:10.575
Please! I know your names very well, but...

01:21:10.658 --> 01:21:13.077
Well, you said
you presented yourselves last night?

01:21:13.161 --> 01:21:15.913
It's of no matter.
Your thoughts were well-taken elsewhere.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.918
My husband is not yet up.

01:21:21.002 --> 01:21:23.421
Well, then shall we start over again?
Won't you join us?

01:21:24.255 --> 01:21:26.007
Yes, of course.

01:21:28.259 --> 01:21:29.778
Well, no wonder the man couldn't write.

01:21:29.802 --> 01:21:31.762
Who would think
of independence married to her?

01:21:31.846 --> 01:21:34.098
- I feel an absolute fool.
- That's good for you, John.

01:21:34.182 --> 01:21:36.100
I tell you, Franklin,
it's positively indecent.

01:21:36.184 --> 01:21:39.854
- John, they're young and they're in love.
- Not them, Franklin. Us.

01:21:39.937 --> 01:21:43.107
Standing down here, waiting for them to...

01:21:44.275 --> 01:21:46.152
Well, what will people think?

01:21:46.235 --> 01:21:49.530
Don't worry, John.
The history books will clean it up.

01:21:49.614 --> 01:21:50.781
Well, it doesn't matter.

01:21:51.115 --> 01:21:54.535
I'll not appear in the history
books anyway. Only you.

01:21:54.619 --> 01:21:59.457
Franklin did this and Franklin did that,
and Franklin did some other damned thing.

01:21:59.582 --> 01:22:02.710
Franklin smote the ground and out sprang

01:22:02.793 --> 01:22:04.504
George Washington,

01:22:04.587 --> 01:22:06.923
fully grown and on his horse.

01:22:07.006 --> 01:22:10.426
Franklin then electrified him
with his miraculous lightning rod

01:22:10.510 --> 01:22:14.138
then the three of them,
Franklin, Washington and the horse,

01:22:14.222 --> 01:22:17.433
conducted the entire revolution
all by themselves.

01:22:20.853 --> 01:22:21.896
I like it.

01:22:23.981 --> 01:22:26.150
I beg your pardon, gentlemen.

01:22:27.276 --> 01:22:31.322
It is indeed an honor
to meet the two greatest men in America.

01:22:31.405 --> 01:22:33.699
Certainly the greatest
within earshot anyway.

01:22:33.783 --> 01:22:35.660
I'm not an idle flatterer, Dr. Franklin.

01:22:35.743 --> 01:22:37.954
My husband admires you both greatly.

01:22:38.162 --> 01:22:39.664
Then we are doubly flattered,

01:22:39.747 --> 01:22:43.125
for we admire very much
that what your husband admires.

01:22:48.256 --> 01:22:49.840
Did you sleep well, madam?

01:22:52.677 --> 01:22:54.595
Well, I mean, did you lie...

01:22:57.139 --> 01:22:58.242
Damn it, you know what I mean.

01:22:58.266 --> 01:22:59.576
Yes, John, we know what you mean.

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:02.270
Tell us about yourself.
We've heard precious little.

01:23:02.353 --> 01:23:04.355
- What's your first name?
- Martha.

01:23:04.605 --> 01:23:05.648
Martha!

01:23:06.566 --> 01:23:08.693
He might at least have told us that.

01:23:08.776 --> 01:23:10.319
Your husband doesn't say very much.

01:23:10.403 --> 01:23:11.904
Most silent man in congress.

01:23:11.988 --> 01:23:13.924
I have never heard him
utter three sentences together.

01:23:13.948 --> 01:23:15.533
Not every man's a talker, John.

01:23:16.033 --> 01:23:19.829
Yes, it's true, you know.
Tom is not a talker.

01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:26.168
<i>Oh, he never speaks his passions</i>

01:23:26.252 --> 01:23:29.297
<i>he never speaks his views</i>

01:23:29.463 --> 01:23:32.883
<i>whereas other men speak volumes</i>

01:23:32.967 --> 01:23:37.471
<i>the man I love is mute</i>

01:23:37.555 --> 01:23:40.141
<i>in truth I can't recall</i>

01:23:40.224 --> 01:23:43.436
<i>being wooed with words</i>

01:23:43.519 --> 01:23:45.813
<i>at all</i>

01:23:45.896 --> 01:23:49.734
<i>even now</i>

01:23:49.817 --> 01:23:51.319
don't stop, madam.

01:23:51.402 --> 01:23:53.112
No. Tell us, how did he win you?

01:23:53.195 --> 01:23:56.365
And how does he hold on
to a bounty such as you?

01:23:56.449 --> 01:23:59.285
Well, surely you've noticed
that tom is a man of many accomplishments.

01:23:59.368 --> 01:24:00.369
Of course.

01:24:00.453 --> 01:24:03.623
Author, lawyer, statesman,
architect, farmer.

01:24:04.874 --> 01:24:09.003
And still one more that
I hesitate to mention.

01:24:09.086 --> 01:24:11.297
Don't hesitate, madam. Don't hesitate.

01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:14.842
No, tell us.
What else can that redheaded tombstone do?

01:24:17.219 --> 01:24:22.224
<i>He plays the violin</i>

01:24:22.308 --> 01:24:26.562
<i>he tucks it right under his chin</i>

01:24:26.646 --> 01:24:28.773
<i>and he bows</i>

01:24:28.898 --> 01:24:30.983
<i>oh, he bows</i>

01:24:31.067 --> 01:24:34.987
<i>for he knows yes, he knows</i>

01:24:35.071 --> 01:24:39.200
<i>that it's hi-hi-hi-diddle diddle</i>

01:24:39.283 --> 01:24:42.870
<i>'twixt my heart, tom and his fiddle</i>

01:24:42.953 --> 01:24:46.957
<i>my strings are unstrung</i>

<i>h i-hi-hi</i>

01:24:49.752 --> 01:24:53.089
<i>hi</i>

01:24:53.172 --> 01:24:56.217
<i>I am undone</i>

01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:57.593
the violin, madam?

01:24:57.677 --> 01:25:01.222
<i>I hear his violin</i>

01:25:01.305 --> 01:25:04.850
<i>and I get that feeling within</i>

01:25:04.934 --> 01:25:08.479
<i>and I sigh oh, I sigh</i>

01:25:08.562 --> 01:25:12.066
<i>he draws near, very near</i>

01:25:12.149 --> 01:25:16.278
<i>and it's hi-hi-hi-diddle diddle</i>

01:25:16.362 --> 01:25:19.949
<i>and goodbye to the fiddle</i>

01:25:20.032 --> 01:25:24.036
<i>my strings are unstrung</i>

01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:26.747
<i>h i-hi-hi</i>

01:25:26.831 --> 01:25:30.084
<i>hi</i>

01:25:30.167 --> 01:25:32.294
<i>I'm always undone</i>

01:25:32.378 --> 01:25:34.338
that settles it, John.
We're taking up the violin.

01:25:34.755 --> 01:25:37.435
Very well, madam. You have us
playing the violin. What happens next?

01:25:37.508 --> 01:25:38.592
Next, Mr. Adams?

01:25:38.676 --> 01:25:40.136
Yes. What does tom do now?

01:25:40.469 --> 01:25:41.804
Why, just what you'd expect.

01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:45.683
We dance.

01:25:46.475 --> 01:25:47.476
Dance?

01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:49.770
Dance? Incredible!

01:25:50.521 --> 01:25:52.898
One, two, three. One, two, three!

01:25:57.486 --> 01:25:59.405
Who's playing the violin?

01:25:59.488 --> 01:26:01.115
John, really?

01:26:37.693 --> 01:26:39.570
John, you can dance.

01:26:39.653 --> 01:26:42.656
We still do a few things
in Boston, Franklin.

01:26:57.087 --> 01:26:59.799
<i>H i-hi-hi</i>

01:26:59.882 --> 01:27:02.843

<i>Hi</i>

01:27:15.606 --> 01:27:18.776

01:27:50.057 --> 01:27:54.937
<i>he plays the violin</i>

01:28:02.653 --> 01:28:06.073
look! Look, Franklin, he's done it.
He's written it.

01:28:08.325 --> 01:28:10.828
"Dear Mr. Adams,
i am taking my wife back to bed.

01:28:10.911 --> 01:28:13.914
"Kindly go away.
Your obedient, t. Jefferson."

01:28:14.999 --> 01:28:16.709
Incredible!

01:28:18.335 --> 01:28:21.005
You know, perhaps I should have
written the declaration after all.

01:28:21.088 --> 01:28:25.217
At my age, there's little doubt

Pennsylvania, Delaware,
Maryland, Virginia's absent,

and north Carolina,
south Carolina and Georgia.

01:29:23.984 --> 01:29:27.029
And what follows
is a complete and up-to-date list

01:29:27.112 --> 01:29:29.406
of all the committees of this congress,

01:29:29.490 --> 01:29:33.410
now sitting, about to
sit orjust having sat.

01:29:34.244 --> 01:29:37.164
"A committee formed
to investigate a complaint made against

01:29:37.247 --> 01:29:40.709
"the quality of yeast
manufactured by Mr. Henry Pendleton's mill

01:29:40.793 --> 01:29:43.337
"designated as the yeast committee."

01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:46.090
"A committee formed
to consider the most effective method

01:29:46.173 --> 01:29:47.591
"of dealing with spies

01:29:47.675 --> 01:29:50.219
"designated as the spies committee."

01:29:51.762 --> 01:29:54.765
"A committee formed to
think, perhaps to do,

01:29:54.848 --> 01:29:58.143
"but in any case,
to gather, to meet, to confer, to talk,

01:29:58.227 --> 01:30:01.689

"A committee formed to..."

01:30:11.115 --> 01:30:12.783
Where is that committee?

01:30:12.866 --> 01:30:15.786
What do you think of it, doctor? Democracy?

01:30:16.453 --> 01:30:19.957
What Plato called
"a charming form of government

01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:22.334
"full of variety and disorder."

01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:25.587
I never knew Plato had
been to Philadelphia.

01:30:26.130 --> 01:30:29.591
Ben, I want you to see some cards
I've gone and had printed up.

01:30:29.675 --> 01:30:31.844
Ought to save everybody here
a lot of time and effort,

01:30:31.927 --> 01:30:36.890
considering the epidemic of bad disposition
that's been going on around here lately

01:30:36.974 --> 01:30:40.060
"dear sir, you are, without
any doubt, a rogue, a rascal,

01:30:40.144 --> 01:30:42.646

"thrice double-damned

01:30:47.151 --> 01:30:48.831
And you sign your name. What do you think?

01:30:48.902 --> 01:30:50.738
I'll take a dozen right now.

01:30:50.821 --> 01:30:52.489
Here it is.

01:30:52.573 --> 01:30:55.576
"A committee formed
to answer all congressional correspondence,

01:30:55.659 --> 01:30:59.329
"designated as the
congressional correspondence committee."

01:31:00.998 --> 01:31:03.584
All right, Franklin, enough socializing.
There's work to be done.

01:31:03.667 --> 01:31:05.252
- Good morning, John.
- What?

01:31:05.335 --> 01:31:07.713
- Good morning.
- Good morning, good morning.

01:31:07.796 --> 01:31:09.757
- Now then, let's get to it.
- Get to what?

01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:11.842
Unanimity, of course. Look at that board.

01:31:11.925 --> 01:31:14.178
Six nays to win over
in little more than a week.

01:31:14.261 --> 01:31:17.097
"A committee formed to consider
the problem of counterfeit money

01:31:17.181 --> 01:31:19.099
"designated as the
counterfeit money committee."

01:31:19.183 --> 01:31:21.643
- Oh, god! What...
- All right, John, all right.

01:31:21.727 --> 01:31:24.104
- Where shall we start?
- Well, what about Delaware?

01:31:24.188 --> 01:31:27.316
Sad thing to see them
on the wrong side after all this time.

01:31:27.399 --> 01:31:29.276
- Any news of Rodney?
- Yes. Mckean's back.

01:31:29.359 --> 01:31:30.360
Thomas!

01:31:30.444 --> 01:31:34.406
"A committee formed to study the causes
of our military defeat in Canada."

01:31:34.490 --> 01:31:38.619
Thomas, how did you leave Caesar?
Ls he still alive?

01:31:38.702 --> 01:31:42.706
Aye, but the journey to Dover
was fearful hard on him.

01:31:42.790 --> 01:31:46.418
He never complained, but I could see
the poor man was suffering terrible.

01:31:46.502 --> 01:31:48.462
But you got him safely home.

01:31:48.545 --> 01:31:52.257
I did, but I doubt
he'll ever set foot out of it again.

01:31:52.341 --> 01:31:54.861
That leaves you and read
split down the middle. Will he come over?

01:31:54.885 --> 01:31:57.679
I don't know. He's a stubborn ignoramus.

01:31:57.763 --> 01:31:59.763
Work on him.
Keep after him till you wear him down.

01:31:59.807 --> 01:32:03.393
Look, John, face facts, will you?
If it were just read standing in our way,

01:32:03.477 --> 01:32:05.938
it wouldn't be so bad,
but look for yourself, man.

01:32:06.021 --> 01:32:09.983
Maryland, Pennsylvania
and the entire south. It's impossible!

01:32:10.067 --> 01:32:13.237
Well, it's impossible if we all
stand around complaining about it.

01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:16.156
To work, mckean!
One foot in front of the other!

01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:17.520
I believe I put it a better way.

01:32:17.574 --> 01:32:20.661
- Never leave off until tomorrow...
- Shut up, Franklin.

01:32:20.744 --> 01:32:23.163
But what good will it do?

01:32:23.247 --> 01:32:26.250
You know Dickinson. He'll never give in.

01:32:26.750 --> 01:32:28.710
And you haven't heard
the last of Rutledge either.

01:32:28.752 --> 01:32:30.921
Never mind about them.
Yourjob is George read.

01:32:31.004 --> 01:32:33.757
Talk him deaf if you have to,
but bring us back Delaware.

01:32:33.841 --> 01:32:36.051
- There's a simpler way.
- What?

01:32:36.635 --> 01:32:38.095
This'll break the tie.

01:32:38.178 --> 01:32:40.139
All right, John, who's next?

01:32:40.222 --> 01:32:42.182
"A committee formed to keep secrets

01:32:42.266 --> 01:32:44.685
"designated as the secrets committee."

01:32:44.768 --> 01:32:46.270
Pennsylvania and Maryland.

01:32:46.353 --> 01:32:48.689
Now, I suggest you try
to get your own house into order

01:32:48.772 --> 01:32:51.066
and I'll take a crack at old vacant-face.

01:32:51.150 --> 01:32:53.235
Lord, look at him stuff himself.

01:32:54.736 --> 01:32:55.988
Mr. chase!

01:32:56.071 --> 01:32:59.324
How about it, chase?
When are you coming to your senses, man?

01:32:59.408 --> 01:33:02.494
Please, Mr. Adams, not while I'm eating.

01:33:02.578 --> 01:33:04.163
Mr. Wilson, sir?

01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:06.999
It's time to assert yourself.

01:33:07.082 --> 01:33:09.042
Tell me something. When you were a judge,

01:33:09.126 --> 01:33:12.004
how in hell did you ever make a decision?

01:33:12.087 --> 01:33:16.800
The decisions I made
were all based on legality and precedence.

01:33:16.884 --> 01:33:20.971
But there is no legality here
and certainly no precedent.

01:33:21.054 --> 01:33:25.767
Because it's a new idea, you clot!

01:33:25.851 --> 01:33:28.395
We'll be setting our own precedent!

01:33:28.478 --> 01:33:32.441
No, Mr. mckean. No, no, no!

01:33:32.524 --> 01:33:36.028
Damn your eyes, read!
You come into this world screaming "no,"

01:33:36.111 --> 01:33:40.115
and you're determined
to leave it the same way, you slimy worm!

01:33:41.742 --> 01:33:44.536
The congress is waiting on you, chase!

01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:48.332
America is waiting!
The whole world is waiting!

01:33:48.415 --> 01:33:50.375
What's that? Kidney?

01:33:50.459 --> 01:33:53.045
Leave me alone, Mr. Adams!

01:33:53.128 --> 01:33:54.671
You're wasting your time.

01:33:54.755 --> 01:33:56.548
If I thought we could win this war,

01:33:56.632 --> 01:33:58.175
I'd be at the front of your ranks.

01:33:58.258 --> 01:34:01.136
But you must know it's impossible.

01:34:01.220 --> 01:34:03.430
You've heard
general Washington's dispatches.

01:34:03.513 --> 01:34:05.557
His army has fallen to pieces.

01:34:05.641 --> 01:34:08.393
Washington is exaggerating the situation

01:34:08.477 --> 01:34:11.021
in order to arouse
this torpid congress into action.

01:34:11.104 --> 01:34:12.648
Why, as chairman of the war committee,

01:34:12.731 --> 01:34:16.526
I can state for a fact that the army
has never been in better shape.

01:34:16.610 --> 01:34:19.279
Never have troops been more cheerful.

01:34:19.363 --> 01:34:21.531
Never have soldiers been more resolute.

01:34:21.615 --> 01:34:25.327
Never have training
and discipline been more spirited.

01:34:25.410 --> 01:34:27.204
Oh, good god.

01:34:36.421 --> 01:34:39.800
May we have your ears, gentlemen?
Mr. thomson has a dispatch.

01:34:39.883 --> 01:34:42.678
"From the commander,

Sweet Jesus!

That man would depress a hyena.

01:36:05.927 --> 01:36:08.972
Well, Mr. Adams,
you're chairman of the war committee.

01:36:09.056 --> 01:36:13.310
Do you feel up to whoring,
drinking, deserting and new brunswick?

01:36:13.518 --> 01:36:17.981
There must be some mistake.
I have an aunt who lives in new brunswick.

01:36:19.983 --> 01:36:22.861
You must tell her to keep up the good work.

01:36:25.655 --> 01:36:27.741
Come, come, Mr. Adams.

01:36:27.824 --> 01:36:30.077
You must see that it's hopeless.

01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:32.037
Let us recall general Washington

01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:35.999
and disband the continental army
before we're overwhelmed.

01:36:36.541 --> 01:36:39.252
Yes, indeed. The English would like that,
now, wouldn't they?

01:36:39.336 --> 01:36:43.048
Why not ask them yourself?
They ought to be here any minute.

01:36:43.715 --> 01:36:46.176
And when they hang you, Mr. Adams,

01:36:46.259 --> 01:36:49.221
I hope you will put in a good word
for the rest of us.

01:36:58.105 --> 01:36:59.981
Face facts, Mr. Adams.

01:37:00.899 --> 01:37:05.487
A handful of drunk and disorderly recruits
against the entire British army,

01:37:06.196 --> 01:37:08.949
the finest musket men on earth.

01:37:09.032 --> 01:37:10.784
How can we win?

01:37:10.867 --> 01:37:13.412
How can we even hope to survive?

01:37:13.495 --> 01:37:15.122
Answer me straight, chase.

01:37:15.705 --> 01:37:18.792
If you thought we could beat the redcoats,

01:37:18.875 --> 01:37:21.294
would Maryland say yea to independence?

01:37:21.378 --> 01:37:23.255
Well, lsuppose“.

01:37:23.338 --> 01:37:24.506
No supposing.

01:37:25.006 --> 01:37:27.050
Would you or wouldn't you?

01:37:29.553 --> 01:37:31.346
Very well, Mr. Adams.

01:37:32.180 --> 01:37:34.474
Yes, we would.

01:37:34.558 --> 01:37:37.644
Then come with me
to new brunswick and see for yourself.

01:37:37.727 --> 01:37:38.728
John, are you mad?

01:37:38.812 --> 01:37:40.415
You heard what Washington said.
It's a shambles.

01:37:40.439 --> 01:37:42.023
They're pushing you into it, Johnny!

01:37:42.107 --> 01:37:43.191
What do you say, chase?

01:37:43.275 --> 01:37:45.986
Go ahead, Sam.
It sounds lively as hell up there.

01:37:46.069 --> 01:37:48.071
All right. Why not?

01:37:48.155 --> 01:37:51.158
And maybe it'll be John Adams
who comes to his senses.

01:37:51.241 --> 01:37:54.369
Mr. president, the war committee
will heed general Washington's request.

01:37:54.453 --> 01:37:57.831
A party consisting of Mr. chase, Dr.
Franklin and myself will leave immediately.

01:37:57.914 --> 01:37:59.249
Is that...

01:37:59.958 --> 01:38:03.003
Ls that satisfactory with you, Dr.
Franklin?

01:38:03.086 --> 01:38:05.755
Wake up, Franklin!
You're going to new brunswick.

01:38:05.839 --> 01:38:07.299
Like hell I am. What for?

01:38:07.382 --> 01:38:09.593
The whoring and the drinking.

01:38:11.219 --> 01:38:14.055
All right, chase!
Move all that lard. Not a moment to lose.

01:38:14.139 --> 01:38:17.767
Left, right, left, right.
Left, right, left, right.

01:38:17.851 --> 01:38:19.519
Lefi, flghllefi!

01:38:30.614 --> 01:38:34.493
Mr. mcnair, all this talk of independence

01:38:34.576 --> 01:38:37.287
has left a certain foulness in the air.

01:38:37.370 --> 01:38:41.291
My friends and I would appreciate it
if you could open some windows.

01:38:41.374 --> 01:38:43.543
Well, what about the flies?

01:38:43.627 --> 01:38:45.629
The windows, Mr. mcnair.

01:38:47.839 --> 01:38:50.884
Open the windows, close the windows.

01:38:50.967 --> 01:38:52.969
Sweet Jesus!

01:39:02.020 --> 01:39:06.149
<i>Oh, say, do you see what I see?</i>

01:39:06.650 --> 01:39:10.028
<i>Congress sitting here in sweet Serenity</i>

01:39:10.111 --> 01:39:13.406

01:39:21.456 --> 01:39:23.458

01:39:23.542 --> 01:39:27.420

"Dear sir, I awoke this morning
to find that general howe

01:41:33.755 --> 01:41:36.758
"has landed 25,000
British regulars and hessian mercenaries

01:41:36.841 --> 01:41:38.385
"on staten island,

"How I wish I had never

"L would have done better

<i>We say this game's not of our choosing</i>

01:42:37.777 --> 01:42:41.114
<i>why should we risk losing?</i>

<i>We're cool, cool men</i>

01:42:47.078 --> 01:42:51.374
Mr. hancock,
you're a man of property, one of us.

01:42:52.041 --> 01:42:54.377
Why don't you join us in our minuet?

01:42:54.461 --> 01:42:57.130
Why do you persist
in dancing with John Adams?

01:42:57.213 --> 01:42:59.174
Good lord, sir, you don't even like him.

01:42:59.716 --> 01:43:03.011
<i>That is true. He annoys me quite a lot</i>

01:43:03.094 --> 01:43:06.431
<i>but still I'd rather trot
to Mr. Adams' new gavotte</i>

01:43:06.931 --> 01:43:10.226
why? For personal glory?
For a place in history?

01:43:10.351 --> 01:43:13.855
Be careful, sir. History will brand him
and his followers as traitors.

01:43:14.147 --> 01:43:16.816
Traitors, Mr. Dickinson? To what?

01:43:16.900 --> 01:43:20.403
The British crown or the
British half crown?

01:43:20.487 --> 01:43:24.324
Fortunately, there are not enough men
of property in America to dictate policy.

01:43:24.407 --> 01:43:27.994
Perhaps not, but don't forget
that most men with nothing

01:43:28.077 --> 01:43:31.331
would rather protect the possibility
of becoming rich

01:43:31.414 --> 01:43:33.958
than face the reality of being poor.

01:43:36.377 --> 01:43:38.755
And that is why they will follow us...

<i>To the right, ever to the right</i>

01:43:42.759 --> 01:43:46.429

<i>cool, cool men</i>

01:45:10.346 --> 01:45:14.058
how'd you like to try and borrow
a dollar from one of them?

01:45:15.143 --> 01:45:17.270
You want some more rum, general?

01:45:17.353 --> 01:45:18.605
General?

01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:21.566
Lord, I ain't even a corporal.

01:45:21.649 --> 01:45:24.027
Yeah, well, what's the army know?

01:45:27.030 --> 01:45:29.032
Here, son. There you go.

01:45:33.620 --> 01:45:37.874
Sit down, gentlemen.
The chair rules it's too damn hot to work.

01:45:48.092 --> 01:45:50.845
Well, general, what's it like out there?

01:45:51.387 --> 01:45:53.348
You probably know more than me.

01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:54.724
Sitting here?

01:45:54.807 --> 01:45:58.770
Sweet Jesus, this is the last place
to find out what's going on.

01:45:59.812 --> 01:46:01.314
I'm aiming to join up.

01:46:01.397 --> 01:46:04.484
What are you talking about?
You don't have to join up.

01:46:04.567 --> 01:46:05.610
You're in congress.

01:46:05.693 --> 01:46:06.986
What's that got to do with it?

01:46:07.070 --> 01:46:10.198
Well, you don't see them
rushing off to get killed, do you?

01:46:10.281 --> 01:46:13.159
They sure are great ones for sending
others, i can tell you that.

01:46:13.910 --> 01:46:15.536
Hey, who sits here?

01:46:16.037 --> 01:46:18.081
Caesar Rodney of Delaware.

01:46:18.581 --> 01:46:19.874
Where are you from, general?

01:46:20.166 --> 01:46:21.834
Wate rtown.

01:46:21.918 --> 01:46:23.836
Now where's that?

01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:25.088
Massachusetts.

01:46:25.421 --> 01:46:27.382
Well, then you belong over there.

01:46:33.429 --> 01:46:34.722
But be careful.

01:46:35.098 --> 01:46:38.601
There's something about that chair
that makes a man awful noisy.

01:46:42.939 --> 01:46:44.774
You seen any fighting?

01:46:46.109 --> 01:46:47.360
Sure did.

01:46:48.486 --> 01:46:52.407
I see'd my two best friends get shot dead
on the very same day.

01:46:53.324 --> 01:46:55.743
And at Lexington it was, too.

01:46:55.827 --> 01:46:57.954
Right on the village green.

01:46:58.663 --> 01:46:59.932
When they didn't come home for supper,

01:46:59.956 --> 01:47:02.959
their mamas went down the hill
looking for them.

01:47:03.042 --> 01:47:05.336
Mrs. lowell, she found Timothy.

01:47:07.630 --> 01:47:08.965
Right off.

01:47:12.218 --> 01:47:13.970
But Mrs. pickett...

01:47:16.806 --> 01:47:19.684
She looked near half the night for William.

01:47:20.852 --> 01:47:23.271
He went and crawled off the green

01:47:24.397 --> 01:47:25.940
before he died.

01:47:34.490 --> 01:47:38.202
<i>Mama, hey, mama</i>

01:47:38.286 --> 01:47:43.332

<i>oh, ma, did we run</i>

01:48:24.040 --> 01:48:27.960
<i>but then we turned round</i>

01:48:28.044 --> 01:48:32.381
<i>and the battle begun</i>

01:48:33.549 --> 01:48:37.178
<i>then I went under</i>

01:48:37.261 --> 01:48:41.390

01:48:42.809 --> 01:48:46.354

Mr. thomson.

01:51:42.113 --> 01:51:44.073
what we saw in new brunswick.

01:51:44.156 --> 01:51:45.741
He's in Annapolis right now,

01:51:45.825 --> 01:51:49.495
describing a ragtag collection
of provincial militiamen

01:51:49.578 --> 01:51:52.581
who couldn't drill together,
train together or march together.

01:51:52.665 --> 01:51:54.625
But when a flock of ducks flew over

01:51:54.709 --> 01:51:57.753
and they saw their first meal
in three full days,

01:51:57.837 --> 01:51:59.839
sweet Jesus, could they shoot together!

01:51:59.922 --> 01:52:02.508
- It was a slaughter.
- A slaughter.

01:52:02.591 --> 01:52:04.218
They're reading the declaration.

01:52:04.302 --> 01:52:06.762
Good god! How far have they gotten?

01:52:07.096 --> 01:52:08.723
"To render the military independent of

01:52:08.806 --> 01:52:10.599
"and superior to the civil power."

01:52:11.100 --> 01:52:13.728
"independent of and superior to..."

01:52:19.608 --> 01:52:20.985
Nothing to fear.

01:52:21.068 --> 01:52:22.236
It's a masterpiece.

01:52:22.903 --> 01:52:24.864
I'm to be congratulated.

01:52:25.448 --> 01:52:26.532
<i>You'?</i>

01:52:27.742 --> 01:52:29.327
For making him write it.

01:52:29.410 --> 01:52:30.619
Of course.

01:52:32.204 --> 01:52:34.957
<i>It's a masterpiece, I say</i>

01:52:35.041 --> 01:52:39.045
<i>they will cheer every word, every letter</i>

01:52:39.128 --> 01:52:42.214
<i>I wish I felt that way</i>

01:52:42.298 --> 01:52:45.634
<i>I believe I can put it better</i>

01:52:45.718 --> 01:52:48.304
<i>now then attend as friend to friend</i>

01:52:48.387 --> 01:52:50.890
<i>our declaration committee</i>

01:52:50.973 --> 01:52:54.727
<i>for us I see immortality</i>

01:52:54.810 --> 01:52:59.899
<i>in Philadelphia city</i>

01:52:59.982 --> 01:53:03.194
<i>a farmer, a lawyer</i>

01:53:03.277 --> 01:53:04.904
<i>and a Sage</i>

01:53:06.364 --> 01:53:08.240
<i>a bit gouty in the leg</i>

01:53:09.450 --> 01:53:13.079
<i>you know, it's quite bizarre
to think that here we are</i>

01:53:13.162 --> 01:53:16.540
<i>playing midwives to an egg</i>

01:53:17.792 --> 01:53:19.001
egg? What egg?

01:53:19.085 --> 01:53:21.128
America. The birth of a new nation.

01:53:21.212 --> 01:53:24.465
If only we could be sure
of what kind of a bird it's going to be.

01:53:24.548 --> 01:53:27.093
Tom has a point.
What sort of bird shall we choose

01:53:27.176 --> 01:53:29.303
as the symbol of our new America?

01:53:29.387 --> 01:53:31.347
The eagle.

01:53:31.430 --> 01:53:32.848
The dove.

01:53:32.932 --> 01:53:34.308
The Turkey.

01:53:35.684 --> 01:53:37.019
The eagle.

01:53:37.978 --> 01:53:40.231
- The dove.
- The eagle!

01:53:41.649 --> 01:53:43.526
- The eagle.
- The Turkey.

01:53:44.860 --> 01:53:46.904
The eagle is a majestic bird.

01:53:46.987 --> 01:53:49.740
The eagle is a scavenger,
a thief and a coward.

01:53:49.824 --> 01:53:53.411
A symbol of over 10 centuries
of European mischief.

01:53:53.494 --> 01:53:54.787
A Turkey?

01:53:54.870 --> 01:53:57.039
The Turkey is a truly noble bird.

01:53:57.123 --> 01:54:00.209
Native American. Source of
sustenance of our original settlers.

01:54:00.292 --> 01:54:02.503
An incredibly brave fellow
who will not flinch

01:54:02.586 --> 01:54:05.631
at attacking a regiment
of englishmen single-handedly!

01:54:05.714 --> 01:54:08.384
Therefore, the national bird
of America is going to be...

01:54:08.467 --> 01:54:09.468
The eagle!

01:54:09.552 --> 01:54:11.053
The eagle!

01:54:11.554 --> 01:54:14.682
<i>We're waiting for the chirp, chirp, chirp</i>

01:54:15.474 --> 01:54:18.185
<i>of an eaglet being born</i>

01:54:18.269 --> 01:54:21.355
<i>waiting for the chirp, chirp, chirp</i>

01:54:21.439 --> 01:54:24.525
<i>on this humid Monday morning</i>

01:54:24.608 --> 01:54:28.904
<i>in this congressional Incubator</i>

01:54:28.988 --> 01:54:31.866
<i>god knows the temperature's hot enough</i>

01:54:31.949 --> 01:54:35.494
<i>to hatch a stone, let alone an egg</i>

01:54:36.912 --> 01:54:40.416
<i>we're waiting
for the scratch, scratch, scratch</i>

01:54:40.499 --> 01:54:43.627
<i>of that tiny little fellow</i>

01:54:43.711 --> 01:54:46.714
<i>waiting for the egg to hatch</i>

01:54:46.797 --> 01:54:49.967
<i>on this humid Monday morning</i>

01:54:50.050 --> 01:54:54.180
<i>in this congressional Incubator</i>

01:54:54.263 --> 01:54:57.099
<i>god knows the temperature's hot enough</i>

01:54:57.183 --> 01:54:58.726
<i>to hatch a stone</i>

01:54:58.809 --> 01:55:00.936
<i>but will it hatch an egg?</i>

01:55:02.605 --> 01:55:06.692
The declaration will be a triumph.
I tell you, a triumph.

01:55:06.775 --> 01:55:08.903
If I was ever sure of anything,
I'm sure of that.

01:55:08.986 --> 01:55:10.321
A triumph.

01:55:11.447 --> 01:55:16.035
And if it isn't, we've still got four
days left to think of something else.

01:55:16.118 --> 01:55:19.663
<i>The eagle's going to crack the shell</i>

01:55:19.747 --> 01:55:22.458
<i>of the egg that england laid</i>

01:55:22.583 --> 01:55:25.544
<i>yes, sir, we can tell, tell, tell</i>

01:55:25.628 --> 01:55:28.631
<i>on this humid Monday morning</i>

01:55:28.714 --> 01:55:32.968
<i>in this congressional Incubator</i>

01:55:33.052 --> 01:55:36.305
<i>and just as tom here has written</i>

01:55:36.388 --> 01:55:38.891
<i>though the shell may
belong to Great Britain</i>

01:55:38.974 --> 01:55:42.728
<i>the eagle inside belongs to us</i>

01:55:42.811 --> 01:55:45.898
<i>and just as tom here has written</i>

01:55:45.981 --> 01:55:48.400
<i>we say, "to hell with Great Britain"</i>

01:55:48.484 --> 01:55:53.822
<i>the eagle inside belongs to us</i>

01:56:05.084 --> 01:56:06.644
"and to do all other acts and things

01:56:06.669 --> 01:56:09.004
"which independent states may of right do.

01:56:09.338 --> 01:56:11.465
"And for the support of this declaration,

01:56:11.549 --> 01:56:14.134
"we mutually pledge to
each other our lives,

01:56:14.218 --> 01:56:16.762
"our fortunes and our sacred honor."

01:56:19.390 --> 01:56:21.308
Thank you, Mr. thomson.

01:56:22.059 --> 01:56:25.980
The congress has heard the report
of the declaration committee.

01:56:26.438 --> 01:56:28.732
Are there any here
who wish to offer alterations,

01:56:28.816 --> 01:56:31.652
deletions, amendments to this declaration?

01:56:32.611 --> 01:56:34.113
Mr. president!

01:56:34.738 --> 01:56:36.490
Gentlemen!

01:56:36.574 --> 01:56:39.201
Gentlemen, please!

01:56:40.536 --> 01:56:42.830
Colonel mckean, I saw your hand first.

01:56:42.913 --> 01:56:44.456
Mr. Jefferson,

01:56:44.540 --> 01:56:47.918
it's a funny paper you've written, tom,
but somewhere in it,

01:56:48.002 --> 01:56:51.964
you mention Scottish
and foreign mercenaries sent to destroy us.

01:56:52.756 --> 01:56:54.258
Scottish, tom?

01:56:54.717 --> 01:56:58.053
That is in reference to a highland regiment
which stood against us at Boston.

01:56:59.722 --> 01:57:04.226
It's more likely Germans wearing kilts
to disguise their being there.

01:57:04.351 --> 01:57:09.273
I ask you to remove the word
and avoid giving offense to a good people.

01:57:09.356 --> 01:57:10.858
Mr. Jefferson?

01:57:12.401 --> 01:57:13.861
The reverend...

01:57:14.236 --> 01:57:15.279
Witherspoon.

01:57:15.362 --> 01:57:19.700
Mr. Jefferson,
nowhere do you mention the supreme being.

01:57:19.783 --> 01:57:21.368
Now, surely this was an oversight,

01:57:21.452 --> 01:57:25.956
for how could we hope to achieve a victory
without his help?

01:57:26.040 --> 01:57:28.500
Therefore, I most humbly
suggest the following addition

01:57:28.584 --> 01:57:30.336
to your final sentence.

01:57:30.419 --> 01:57:34.256
"With a firm reliance
on the protection of divine Providence."

01:57:34.590 --> 01:57:35.633
Mr. Jefferson?

01:57:38.761 --> 01:57:39.845
Mr. read.

01:57:41.555 --> 01:57:44.600
Among your charges
against the king, Mr. Jefferson,

01:57:44.683 --> 01:57:48.812
you accuse him of depriving us of
the benefits of trial by jury.

01:57:48.896 --> 01:57:50.272
This is untrue, sir.

01:57:50.356 --> 01:57:53.275
In Delaware, we've always had trial byjury.

01:57:54.193 --> 01:57:56.028
In Massachusetts, we have not.

01:57:56.779 --> 01:58:00.491
Well, then I suggest that the
words "in many cases" be added.

01:58:01.450 --> 01:58:02.951
Mr. Jefferson?

01:58:03.452 --> 01:58:06.664
"In many cases"? Brilliant!

01:58:06.747 --> 01:58:09.291
I suppose every time
you see those three words,

01:58:09.375 --> 01:58:11.543
your puny chest will swell with pride

01:58:11.627 --> 01:58:14.296
over your great historical contribution.

01:58:14.380 --> 01:58:17.716
It's more memorable
than your unprincipled whitewash

01:58:17.800 --> 01:58:19.802
of that race of barbarians!

01:58:19.885 --> 01:58:22.346
Race of barbarians?

01:58:22.429 --> 01:58:23.722
Why, I'll have you...

01:58:24.348 --> 01:58:26.725
Colonel mckean, Mr. read, that's enough!

01:58:29.311 --> 01:58:30.991
- Mr. Hopkins.
- L've no objections, Johnny.

01:58:31.021 --> 01:58:32.731
I'm just trying to get a drink.

01:58:32.815 --> 01:58:35.066
I should've known. Mcnair, get him a rum.

01:58:35.067 --> 01:58:36.707
I should've known. Mcnair, get him a rum.

01:58:40.948 --> 01:58:42.324
Mr. bartlett.

01:58:43.117 --> 01:58:44.284
Mr. Jefferson.

01:58:44.702 --> 01:58:47.496
I beg you to remember
that we still have friends in england.

01:58:47.579 --> 01:58:51.500
I see no purpose in antagonizing
them with such phrases as...

01:58:52.459 --> 01:58:55.212
"Unfeeling brethren" and "enemies at war."

01:58:55.295 --> 01:58:58.632
Our quarrel is with the British king,
not the British people.

01:58:58.716 --> 01:59:00.759
Be sensible, bartlett.

01:59:00.843 --> 01:59:01.844
Remove those phrases,

01:59:01.927 --> 01:59:04.763
and the entire paragraph
becomes meaningless.

01:59:04.847 --> 01:59:08.058
And it so happens that it's one
of the most stirring and poetic

01:59:08.142 --> 01:59:11.478
of any passage
in the entire document. Now...

01:59:11.562 --> 01:59:15.107
We're a congress, Mr. Adams,
not a literary society.

01:59:15.190 --> 01:59:17.943
I ask that the entire
paragraph be stricken.

01:59:18.026 --> 01:59:19.027
Mr. Jefferson?

01:59:21.697 --> 01:59:22.781
Good god.

01:59:22.865 --> 01:59:25.826
Jefferson, when are you going to speak up
for your own work?

01:59:25.909 --> 01:59:28.954
I had hoped
that the work would speak for itself.

01:59:29.538 --> 01:59:30.914
Mr. hancock?

01:59:31.540 --> 01:59:32.916
What is it, Mr. mcnair?

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:36.462
I can't say I'm very fond of
"the United States of America"

01:59:36.545 --> 01:59:38.046
as a name for a new country.

01:59:40.048 --> 01:59:42.801
I don't care what you're fond of, Mr.
Mcnair.

01:59:42.885 --> 01:59:45.471
You're not a member of this congress!

01:59:48.682 --> 01:59:50.058
Mr. sherman.

01:59:50.601 --> 01:59:53.562
Brother Jefferson, I noted at least

01:59:53.645 --> 01:59:55.773
two distinct and direct references

01:59:55.856 --> 01:59:58.400
to the British parliament
in your declaration.

01:59:58.484 --> 02:00:01.111
Do you think it's wise
to alienate that August body

02:00:01.195 --> 02:00:02.362
in light of our contention

02:00:02.446 --> 02:00:05.073
that they've never
had any authority over us anyway?

02:00:05.157 --> 02:00:07.576
This is a revolution, damn it!

02:00:07.659 --> 02:00:09.745
We're going to have to offend somebody.

02:00:09.828 --> 02:00:11.413
Brother hancock!

02:00:15.834 --> 02:00:17.836
John.John.

02:00:17.920 --> 02:00:20.440
You'll give yourself an attack of
apoplexy if you're not careful.

02:00:20.464 --> 02:00:21.566
Have you heard what they're doing to it?

02:00:21.590 --> 02:00:22.716
- Have you heard?
- I heard.

02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:26.261
And, so far, that's just our friends.
Can you imagine what our enemies will do?

02:00:26.345 --> 02:00:29.097
The word "parliament"
will be removed wherever it occurs.

02:00:29.181 --> 02:00:32.392
They won't be satisfied till they remove
one of the "f's" from Jefferson's name.

02:00:32.476 --> 02:00:35.270
Courage, John. It won't last much longer.

02:00:38.524 --> 02:00:40.025
Mr. Dickinson.

02:00:40.526 --> 02:00:42.569
Mr. Jefferson,

02:00:42.653 --> 02:00:44.530
I have very little interest in your paper,

02:00:44.613 --> 02:00:48.325
as there's no doubt in my mind
that we've all but heard the last of it.

02:00:48.408 --> 02:00:50.994
But I am curious about one thing.

02:00:51.954 --> 02:00:55.374
Why do you refer to king
George as a tyrant?

02:00:57.084 --> 02:00:58.961
Because he is a tyrant.

02:00:59.962 --> 02:01:03.966
I remind you, Mr. Jefferson,
that this tyrant is still your king.

02:01:05.634 --> 02:01:07.886
When a king becomes a tyrant,

02:01:07.970 --> 02:01:11.557
he thereby breaks the contract
binding his subjects to him.

02:01:11.640 --> 02:01:13.267
How so?

02:01:13.350 --> 02:01:15.477
By taking away their rights.

02:01:15.561 --> 02:01:18.522
Rights that came from
him in the first place?

02:01:18.605 --> 02:01:20.315
All except one.

02:01:20.399 --> 02:01:23.110
The right to be free comes from nature.

02:01:23.986 --> 02:01:26.947
And are we not free, Mr. Jefferson?

02:01:29.157 --> 02:01:31.285
Homes entered without warrant.

02:01:31.368 --> 02:01:34.496
Citizens arrested without charge.

02:01:34.580 --> 02:01:37.958
And in many places,
free assembly itself denied.

02:01:38.041 --> 02:01:40.794
No one approves of such things,

02:01:40.878 --> 02:01:43.171
but these are dangerous times.

02:01:43.255 --> 02:01:44.965
Be careful, Mr. Dickinson.

02:01:45.048 --> 02:01:49.136
Those who give up some of their Liberty in
order to obtain a little temporary safety,

02:01:49.219 --> 02:01:51.722
deserve neither Liberty nor safety.

02:01:53.390 --> 02:01:54.766
Mr. Wilson.

02:01:56.268 --> 02:01:59.688
Do we in Pennsylvania
consider king George a tyrant?

02:02:01.023 --> 02:02:03.400
Well, I don't know.

02:02:04.192 --> 02:02:05.319
He...

02:02:07.529 --> 02:02:09.489
No. No, we don't.

02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:11.909
He's not a tyrant.

02:02:12.951 --> 02:02:14.453
In Pennsylvania.

02:02:14.536 --> 02:02:15.954
There you are, Mr. Jefferson.

02:02:16.038 --> 02:02:18.081
Your declaration does not speak for us all.

02:02:18.165 --> 02:02:20.292
I demand the word "tyrant" be removed.

02:02:20.375 --> 02:02:21.375
Very well.

02:02:21.418 --> 02:02:23.587
Just a moment, Mr. thomson.

02:02:23.670 --> 02:02:25.297
I do not consent.

02:02:26.256 --> 02:02:29.885
The king is a tyrant
whether we say so or not.

02:02:31.178 --> 02:02:32.596
We might as well say so.

02:02:32.679 --> 02:02:34.640
But I already scratched it out.

02:02:34.723 --> 02:02:36.683
Then scratch it back in.

02:02:38.435 --> 02:02:41.980
Put it back, Mr. thomson.
The king will remain a tyrant.

02:02:46.068 --> 02:02:47.152
Mr. Hewes.

02:02:47.235 --> 02:02:48.654
Mr. Jefferson.

02:02:48.737 --> 02:02:51.823
Nowhere do you mention
deep-sea fishing rights.

02:02:54.242 --> 02:02:57.245
Good god! Fishing rights!

02:02:58.246 --> 02:03:01.083
How long is this piddling to go on?

02:03:01.166 --> 02:03:04.586
We have been here for three full days.

02:03:04.670 --> 02:03:08.423
We have endured, by my count,
85 separate changes,

02:03:08.507 --> 02:03:11.927
and the removal of close to 400 words.

02:03:12.010 --> 02:03:15.138
Now, would you whip it
and beat it till you break its spirit?

02:03:15.222 --> 02:03:20.894
I tell you that document is a masterful
expression of the American mind!

02:03:26.108 --> 02:03:27.776
If there are no more changes,

02:03:27.859 --> 02:03:31.321
then I can assume the report
of the declaration committee has been...

02:03:31.446 --> 02:03:33.448
Just a moment, Mr. president.

02:03:34.449 --> 02:03:35.701
Look out.

02:03:37.119 --> 02:03:39.663
I wonder if we might prevail
upon Mr. thomson

02:03:39.746 --> 02:03:43.750
to read again a small portion
of Mr. Jefferson's declaration.

02:03:44.835 --> 02:03:47.671
The one beginning
"he has waged cruel war."

02:03:50.632 --> 02:03:52.801
"He has affected... he's combined...

02:03:52.884 --> 02:03:55.345
"He's abdicated... he's plundered...

02:03:55.429 --> 02:03:58.098
"He's constrained...
He's excited... he's incited...

02:03:58.181 --> 02:04:00.600
"He's waged cruel war." Here it is.

02:04:00.684 --> 02:04:03.437
"He's waged cruel war
against human nature itself

02:04:03.520 --> 02:04:06.398
"in the persons
of a distant people who never offended him,

02:04:06.481 --> 02:04:10.402
"captivating and carrying them
into slavery in another hemisphere,

02:04:10.485 --> 02:04:12.070
"determined to keep open a market

02:04:12.154 --> 02:04:14.114
"where men should be bought and sold,

02:04:14.197 --> 02:04:15.277
"he has prostituted his..."

02:04:15.323 --> 02:04:18.410
That will suffice, Mr. thomson.
I thank you, sir.

02:04:18.493 --> 02:04:23.165
Mr. Jefferson, I can't quite make out
what it is you're talking about.

02:04:25.167 --> 02:04:26.960
Slavery, Mr. Rutledge.

02:04:27.044 --> 02:04:28.295
Oh, yes.

02:04:28.378 --> 02:04:31.006
You're referring to us
as slaves of the king.

02:04:31.089 --> 02:04:33.759
No, sir. I'm referring to our slaves.

02:04:33.842 --> 02:04:35.343
Black slaves.

02:04:38.180 --> 02:04:39.639
Black slaves.

02:04:40.849 --> 02:04:43.101
Why didn't you say so, sir?

02:04:43.185 --> 02:04:45.771
Were you trying to hide your meaning?

02:04:46.521 --> 02:04:47.773
No, sir.

02:04:47.856 --> 02:04:50.692
Just another literary license, then.

02:04:51.818 --> 02:04:53.195
If you like.

02:04:54.071 --> 02:04:56.573
I don't like at all, Mr. Jefferson.

02:04:57.616 --> 02:05:01.661
To us, in south Carolina,
black slavery is our peculiar institution,

02:05:01.745 --> 02:05:03.538
and a cherished way of life.

02:05:03.622 --> 02:05:06.458
Nevertheless, we must abolish it.

02:05:06.541 --> 02:05:09.586
Nothing is more certainly written
in the book of fate

02:05:09.669 --> 02:05:11.546
than that these people shall be free.

02:05:11.630 --> 02:05:15.550
I am not concerned with the book of fate
right now, Mr. Jefferson.

02:05:15.634 --> 02:05:18.274
I'm more concerned with what is
written in that little paper there.

02:05:18.345 --> 02:05:22.057
That little paper there
deals with freedom for Americans.

02:05:24.059 --> 02:05:25.393
Oh, really?

02:05:26.853 --> 02:05:28.105
Mr. Adams

02:05:28.855 --> 02:05:33.151
is now calling our black
slaves "Americans."

02:05:33.235 --> 02:05:35.362
- Are they, now?
- Yes, they are.

02:05:35.445 --> 02:05:37.948
They're people and they're here.

02:05:38.031 --> 02:05:39.842
If there's any other requirement,
I've never heard of it.

02:05:39.866 --> 02:05:42.744
They are here, yes, but they are not
people, sir. They are property.

02:05:42.828 --> 02:05:47.040
No, sir. They are people
who are being treated as property.

02:05:47.124 --> 02:05:49.835
I tell you, the rights of human nature

02:05:49.918 --> 02:05:53.505
are deeply wounded
by this infamous practice.

02:05:53.588 --> 02:05:57.509
Then see to your own wounds, Mr. Jefferson,
for you are a practitioner!

02:05:57.592 --> 02:05:59.010
Are you not?

02:06:05.267 --> 02:06:08.103
I have already resolved

02:06:09.104 --> 02:06:10.897
to release my slaves.

02:06:29.291 --> 02:06:30.834
Then I'm sorry,

02:06:31.710 --> 02:06:35.797
for you've also resolved
the ruination of your personal economy.

02:06:35.881 --> 02:06:38.258
Economy. Always economy.

02:06:39.384 --> 02:06:42.387
There's more to this
than a filthy purse string, Rutledge.

02:06:42.470 --> 02:06:44.556
It's an offense against man and god.

02:06:44.639 --> 02:06:48.059
It's a stinking business, Mr. Rutledge.
A stinking business.

02:06:48.143 --> 02:06:50.187
Is it really, Mr. Hopkins?

02:06:50.270 --> 02:06:52.355
Then what is that I smell

02:06:52.439 --> 02:06:54.649
floating down from the north?

02:06:56.193 --> 02:06:58.612
Could that be the aroma of hypocrisy?

02:06:58.695 --> 02:07:02.824
For who holds the other end
of that filthy purse string, Mr. Adams?

02:07:06.286 --> 02:07:11.625
Our northern brethren
feeling a bit tender toward our slaves.

02:07:11.708 --> 02:07:13.627
They don't keep slaves.

02:07:14.169 --> 02:07:15.337
Oh, no.

02:07:16.588 --> 02:07:20.383
But they're willing
to be considerable carriers

02:07:20.467 --> 02:07:22.219
of slaves to others.

02:07:22.969 --> 02:07:24.554
They're willing.

02:07:26.014 --> 02:07:27.641
For the shilling.

02:07:28.141 --> 02:07:30.477
Or haven't you heard, Mr. Adams?

02:07:31.853 --> 02:07:34.439
Clink, clink.

02:07:35.523 --> 02:07:38.109

02:07:38.193 --> 02:07:41.029

<i>and slaves</i>

02:09:29.346 --> 02:09:32.390
gentlemen, you mustn't think
that our northern friends

02:09:32.474 --> 02:09:36.019
see our black slaves
as merely figures in a ledger.

02:09:36.102 --> 02:09:37.395
Oh, no.

02:09:37.479 --> 02:09:41.733
They see them as figures on a block.

02:09:41.816 --> 02:09:44.486
Look at the faces at the
auctions, gentlemen.

02:09:44.569 --> 02:09:47.072
White faces on African wharves.

02:09:47.155 --> 02:09:48.782
Seafaring faces.

02:09:48.865 --> 02:09:50.617
New england faces.

02:09:50.700 --> 02:09:53.078
"Put them in the ships."

02:09:53.161 --> 02:09:55.747
"Cram them in the ships."

02:09:55.830 --> 02:09:59.584
"Stuff them in the ships."

02:09:59.667 --> 02:10:02.962
Hurry, gentlemen. Let the auction begin.

02:10:03.505 --> 02:10:08.593
<i>Ya-ha, ya-ha-ma-cundah</i>

02:10:08.676 --> 02:10:12.472

That's the cry of the auctioneer.

Mr. Hewes.

02:12:18.890 --> 02:12:20.141
Dr. hall.

02:12:30.985 --> 02:12:33.571
Don't worry, John. They'll be back.

02:12:33.655 --> 02:12:36.282
Aye, to vote us down.

02:12:42.956 --> 02:12:44.958
Adams! Franklin!

02:12:46.501 --> 02:12:48.419
It's done. I have it.

02:12:48.503 --> 02:12:50.964
And the Maryland assembly's approved it.

02:12:51.047 --> 02:12:56.177
I told them about one of the
greatest military engagements in history

02:12:56.261 --> 02:12:58.388
against a flock of...

02:13:01.683 --> 02:13:03.142
What's wrong?

02:13:04.727 --> 02:13:07.730
- I thought...
- You'll have to forgive them, Mr. chase.

02:13:07.814 --> 02:13:10.483
They just suffered a slight setback.

02:13:10.567 --> 02:13:13.278
And after all, "what is a man profited

02:13:13.361 --> 02:13:17.615
"if he shall gain Maryland
and lose the entire south?"

02:13:18.825 --> 02:13:21.703
Matthew, chapter 16, verse 26.

02:13:23.454 --> 02:13:24.664
Mcnair.

02:13:25.331 --> 02:13:27.166
I know. The flies.

02:13:27.250 --> 02:13:28.293
No.

02:13:29.210 --> 02:13:30.461
The rum.

02:13:35.091 --> 02:13:37.885
Well, what are we all sitting around for?

02:13:39.262 --> 02:13:40.972
We're wasting time. Precious time.

02:13:41.055 --> 02:13:43.141
Thomas, I want you
to ride down into Delaware

02:13:43.224 --> 02:13:44.851
and fetch back Caesar Rodney.

02:13:44.934 --> 02:13:48.271
John, are you mad?
It's 80 miles, and he's a dying man.

02:13:48.354 --> 02:13:50.398
No, he's a patriot.

02:13:50.481 --> 02:13:52.859
John, what good will it do?
The south's done us in.

02:13:52.942 --> 02:13:54.569
And suppose they change their minds?

02:13:54.652 --> 02:13:57.155
Can we get Delaware without Rodney?

02:13:59.907 --> 02:14:02.952
God! What a bastardly bunch we are.

02:14:05.496 --> 02:14:08.750
- Stephen, I want you to...
- L'm going to the tavern, Johnny.

02:14:08.833 --> 02:14:12.378
If there's anything I can do for you there,
let me know.

02:14:13.296 --> 02:14:14.464
Chase.

02:14:15.340 --> 02:14:16.424
Bartlett!

02:14:16.507 --> 02:14:20.094
What's the use, John?
The vote's tomorrow morning.

02:14:20.178 --> 02:14:22.597
There's less than a full day left.

02:14:25.975 --> 02:14:27.518
Roger.

02:14:27.602 --> 02:14:30.104
Face facts, John. It's finished.

02:14:32.857 --> 02:14:34.442
I'm sorry, John.

02:14:42.825 --> 02:14:44.786
We have no choice, John.

02:14:45.953 --> 02:14:47.789
The slavery clause has got to go.

02:14:51.042 --> 02:14:52.460
Franklin, what are you saying?

02:14:52.960 --> 02:14:54.754
It's a luxury we can't afford.

02:14:55.880 --> 02:14:57.131
A luxury?

02:14:59.550 --> 02:15:03.304
A half million souls in chains,

02:15:03.388 --> 02:15:06.391
and Dr. Franklin calls it a luxury.

02:15:07.517 --> 02:15:09.394
Maybe you should've
walked out with the south.

02:15:09.936 --> 02:15:11.896
You forget yourself, sir.

02:15:11.979 --> 02:15:15.149
I founded the first anti-slavery society
on this continent.

02:15:15.608 --> 02:15:18.903
Don't wave your credentials at me.
Perhaps it's time you had them renewed.

02:15:19.529 --> 02:15:22.573
The issue here is independence.

02:15:22.657 --> 02:15:25.451
Perhaps you've forgotten that fact,
but I have not.

02:15:25.535 --> 02:15:29.080
How dare you jeopardize our cause

02:15:29.163 --> 02:15:31.082
when we've come so far!

02:15:32.709 --> 02:15:34.043
These men,

02:15:35.336 --> 02:15:37.588
no matter how much
we may disagree with them,

02:15:37.672 --> 02:15:41.092
are not ribbon clerks to be ordered about.

02:15:41.175 --> 02:15:44.387
They're proud, accomplished men.
The cream of their colonies.

02:15:44.470 --> 02:15:47.473
And whether you like it or not,
they and the people they represent

02:15:47.557 --> 02:15:51.436
will be part of this new nation
you hope to create.

02:15:51.519 --> 02:15:54.731
Now either learn how to live with them
or pack up and go home.

02:16:00.361 --> 02:16:03.448
In any case,
stop acting like a Boston fishwife.

02:16:17.545 --> 02:16:20.423
Good god. What's happened to me?

02:16:20.506 --> 02:16:23.801
John Adams. The great John Adams.

02:16:24.302 --> 02:16:25.845
What have I come to?

02:16:25.928 --> 02:16:27.805
Law practice down the pipe.

02:16:27.889 --> 02:16:30.016
Farm mortgaged to the hilt.

02:16:30.099 --> 02:16:33.227
At a stage in life when other men prosper,

02:16:33.311 --> 02:16:35.938
I'm reduced to living in Philadelphia.

02:16:37.982 --> 02:16:39.441
Philadelphia.

02:16:48.825 --> 02:16:51.412
Abigail, what am I going to do?

02:16:51.495 --> 02:16:52.746
<i>Do, John?</i>

02:16:54.081 --> 02:16:55.750
I need your help.

02:16:56.416 --> 02:16:59.045
<i>You don't usually ask my advice.</i>

02:16:59.128 --> 02:17:02.548
Yes, well, there doesn't appear
to be anyone else right now.

02:17:02.632 --> 02:17:04.759
<i>Very well, John. What is it?</i>

02:17:05.510 --> 02:17:08.930
The entire south
has just walked out of this congress,

02:17:09.555 --> 02:17:13.518
George Washington
is on the verge of total annihilation,

02:17:13.601 --> 02:17:16.603
and the precious cause for which I
have labored these several years

02:17:16.687 --> 02:17:18.439
has come to nothing.

02:17:20.398 --> 02:17:23.861
And it seems
that I'm obnoxious and disliked.

02:17:23.945 --> 02:17:25.571
<i>Nonsense, John.</i>

02:17:26.322 --> 02:17:28.782
That I am unwilling to face reality.

02:17:28.866 --> 02:17:30.993
<i>Foolishness, John.</i>

02:17:31.076 --> 02:17:32.787
That I'm pigheaded.

02:17:33.412 --> 02:17:35.206
<i>Well, there you have me, John.</i>

02:17:35.289 --> 02:17:37.333
<i>I'm afraid you are pigheaded.</i>

02:17:41.254 --> 02:17:42.588
Well, yes.

02:17:45.174 --> 02:17:46.467
Abby.

02:17:47.927 --> 02:17:50.638
Has it been any kind of a life for you?

02:17:51.513 --> 02:17:53.766
God knows I haven't given you very much.

02:17:54.642 --> 02:17:56.519
I never asked for more.

02:17:57.311 --> 02:17:59.230
After all, I am Mrs. John Adams.

02:17:59.313 --> 02:18:01.858
That's quite a lot for one lifetime.

02:18:04.151 --> 02:18:05.570
Is it, Abby?

02:18:06.361 --> 02:18:08.364
Well, think of it, John.
To be married to the man

02:18:08.447 --> 02:18:11.534
who is always the first
in line to be hanged...

02:18:15.871 --> 02:18:17.790
Yes. The agitator.

02:18:20.334 --> 02:18:21.669
Why, Abby?

02:18:23.754 --> 02:18:26.173
You must tell me what it is. I...

02:18:26.841 --> 02:18:30.093
Well, I have always been dissatisfied.
I know that.

02:18:31.596 --> 02:18:36.183
But lately, i
find that I reek of discontentment.

02:18:36.267 --> 02:18:39.603
It fills my throat and it floods my brain.

02:18:43.941 --> 02:18:46.861
Sometimes I fear there
is no longer a dream,

02:18:48.154 --> 02:18:50.281
but only the discontentment.

02:18:52.407 --> 02:18:53.825
Oh, John.

02:18:56.245 --> 02:18:59.248
Can you really know so
little about yourself?

02:19:00.833 --> 02:19:02.126
Can you think so little of me

02:19:02.209 --> 02:19:05.588
that you'd believe
I'd marry the man you've described?

02:19:07.757 --> 02:19:11.343
Have you forgotten
what you used to say to me? I haven't.

02:19:12.719 --> 02:19:14.805
"Commitment, Abby.

02:19:15.889 --> 02:19:17.266
"Commitment.

02:19:18.726 --> 02:19:22.730
"There are only two creatures of value
on the face of this earth.

02:19:23.814 --> 02:19:25.983
"Those with a commitment,

02:19:26.066 --> 02:19:29.236
"and those who require
the commitment of others."

02:19:31.405 --> 02:19:33.240
Do you remember, John?

02:19:35.493 --> 02:19:37.077
Yes, I remember.

02:19:37.702 --> 02:19:39.621
Mr. Adams!

02:19:41.248 --> 02:19:43.584
Are you up there, Mr. Adams?

02:19:44.251 --> 02:19:45.920
What do you want?

02:19:46.337 --> 02:19:50.132
There's a delivery down here for you.

02:19:50.216 --> 02:19:51.592
What is it?

02:19:53.469 --> 02:19:55.680
Where did it come from? Who sent it?

02:20:01.936 --> 02:20:06.565
<i>Compliments of
the Concord ladies' coffee club</i>

02:20:06.649 --> 02:20:11.529
<i>and the sisterhood of the truro synagogue</i>

02:20:11.612 --> 02:20:16.492
<i>and the Friday evening
baptist sewing circle</i>

02:20:16.575 --> 02:20:21.539
<i>and the holy Christian sisters of St.
Claire</i>

02:20:21.622 --> 02:20:25.626
<i>all for you</i>

02:20:25.710 --> 02:20:28.838
<i>John</i>

02:20:28.921 --> 02:20:34.343
<i>I am as I ever was</i>

02:20:34.427 --> 02:20:39.306
<i>and ever shall be</i>

02:20:39.390 --> 02:20:44.895
<i>yours, yours, yours</i>

02:20:44.979 --> 02:20:47.606
<i>yours</i>

02:20:47.690 --> 02:20:50.943
Abigail, what's in these kegs?

02:20:51.444 --> 02:20:57.992
<i>Saltpeter, John</i>

02:21:05.833 --> 02:21:07.001
mcnair!

02:21:07.877 --> 02:21:11.088
Mcnair, go out and buy every damned pin
you can find in Philadelphia.

02:21:11.172 --> 02:21:12.923
Pin? What sort of pin?

02:21:13.007 --> 02:21:15.926
Well, I don't know.
Whatever the ladies use for their sewing.

02:21:16.010 --> 02:21:19.430
Franklin, Jefferson,
what are you all sitting around for?

02:21:19.513 --> 02:21:21.223
Didn't you hear a word I said before?

02:21:21.307 --> 02:21:23.059
Never mind about that.

02:21:23.142 --> 02:21:24.769
Now, here's what I want you to do.

02:21:24.852 --> 02:21:27.063
John, I'm not even speaking to you.

02:21:27.146 --> 02:21:29.899
It's too late for that, damn it.
There's work to be done.

02:21:29.982 --> 02:21:31.817
Jefferson, go find Rutledge.

02:21:31.901 --> 02:21:33.861
Don't come back
until you've worn him down.

02:21:33.944 --> 02:21:35.863
Now, you're both Southern aristocrats.

02:21:35.946 --> 02:21:38.032
If he'll listen to anybody,
he'll listen to you.

02:21:38.115 --> 02:21:40.034
Franklin, out of that chair!

02:21:40.117 --> 02:21:42.745
What good is the south
if you can't deliver Pennsylvania?

02:21:42.828 --> 02:21:44.413
Talk to Wilson.

02:21:44.497 --> 02:21:45.748
Get him away from Dickinson.

02:21:45.831 --> 02:21:49.001
That's the only way to do it.
Go on, now, both of you.

02:21:49.210 --> 02:21:51.712
- John...
- Time's running out, damn it.

02:21:52.588 --> 02:21:53.881
Now move.

02:21:57.259 --> 02:21:58.803
I'm still from Massachusetts, John.

02:22:00.763 --> 02:22:02.681
You know where I stand.

02:22:03.140 --> 02:22:04.475
I'll do whatever you say.

02:22:08.020 --> 02:22:09.188
No.

02:22:10.481 --> 02:22:13.067
No, you're the president of congress.

02:22:14.318 --> 02:22:17.029
You're a fair man, hancock. Stay that way.

02:22:39.301 --> 02:22:42.763
Tell me, Mr. thomson, out of curiosity,

02:22:43.472 --> 02:22:47.059
do you stand with Mr. Dickinson,
or do you stand with me?

02:22:49.019 --> 02:22:51.021
I stand with the general.

02:22:52.940 --> 02:22:57.236
Well, lately,
I've had the oddest feeling that he's been

02:22:57.319 --> 02:22:58.821
writing to me.

02:23:02.908 --> 02:23:05.911
<i>I have been in expectation</i>

02:23:05.995 --> 02:23:09.206
<i>of receiving a reply</i>

02:23:09.290 --> 02:23:15.462
<i>on the subject of my last 15 dispatches</i>

<i>ls anybody there?</i>

02:23:23.053 --> 02:23:28.642
<i>Does anybody care?</i>

02:23:29.810 --> 02:23:35.232
<i>Does anybody care?</i>

02:23:37.401 --> 02:23:39.820
"Your humble and obedient..."

02:24:13.062 --> 02:24:14.730
"Ls anybody there?

02:24:18.400 --> 02:24:20.653
"Does anybody care?"

02:24:24.323 --> 02:24:30.829
<i>Does anybody see what I see?</i>

02:24:34.541 --> 02:24:36.877
<i>They want me to quit</i>

02:24:37.878 --> 02:24:42.216
<i>they say, "John, give up the fight"</i>

02:24:42.299 --> 02:24:45.386

02:24:45.469 --> 02:24:48.889
<i>good night, forever, good night!</i>

02:24:49.890 --> 02:24:54.561
<i>For I have crossed the rubicon</i>

02:24:54.645 --> 02:24:57.439
<i>let the bridge be burned behind me</i>

02:24:57.523 --> 02:24:59.817

<i>come what may</i>

02:25:02.069 --> 02:25:03.153

02:25:03.570 --> 02:25:07.825
<i>The croakers all say we'll rue the day</i>

02:25:07.908 --> 02:25:13.163
<i>there'll be hell to pay in fiery purgatory</i>

02:25:13.247 --> 02:25:17.001
<i>through all the gloom,
through all the gloom</i>

02:25:17.084 --> 02:25:21.046
<i>I can see the rays of ravishing light</i>

02:25:21.130 --> 02:25:23.465

<i>Does anybody see what I see?</i>

02:25:34.476 --> 02:25:36.437
<i>I see fireworks</i>

02:25:37.146 --> 02:25:40.482
<i>I see the pageant and pomp and parade</i>

02:25:40.566 --> 02:25:43.027
<i>I hear the bells ringing out</i>

02:25:43.110 --> 02:25:46.238
<i>I hear the cannons roar</i>

02:25:46.322 --> 02:25:48.866
<i>I see Americans</i>

02:25:48.949 --> 02:25:52.369
<i>all Americans free</i>

02:25:52.453 --> 02:25:55.706
<i>forevermore</i>

02:26:08.635 --> 02:26:14.183
<i>how quiet, how quiet the chamber is</i>

02:26:15.476 --> 02:26:22.316

<i>Does anybody see what I see?</i>

02:26:46.840 --> 02:26:48.384
Yes, Mr. Adams.

02:26:50.386 --> 02:26:51.553
I do.

02:26:55.349 --> 02:26:56.642
Dr. hall.

02:26:57.434 --> 02:26:59.520
I didn't know anyone was...

02:27:00.646 --> 02:27:02.773
I'm sorry if I startled you.

02:27:03.649 --> 02:27:05.275
I couldn't sleep.

02:27:06.318 --> 02:27:09.738
And in trying to resolve my dilemma,

02:27:09.822 --> 02:27:12.741
I remembered something I'd once read.

02:27:12.825 --> 02:27:16.620
That a representative
owes the people not only his industry,

02:27:16.703 --> 02:27:19.206
but his judgment.

02:27:19.289 --> 02:27:22.751
And he betrays them
if he sacrifices it to their opinion.

02:27:25.879 --> 02:27:28.257
That was written by Edmund Burke,

02:27:29.800 --> 02:27:32.302
a member of the British parliament.

02:28:01.248 --> 02:28:03.167
Good night, Mr. Adams.

02:28:03.250 --> 02:28:04.585
Good night.

02:28:15.679 --> 02:28:17.389
<i>It's never been done before.</i>

02:28:17.473 --> 02:28:20.118
<i>No colony has ever broken from the
parent stem in the history of the world.</i>

02:28:20.142 --> 02:28:22.811
<i>If you have grievances,
and I'm sure you have,</i>

02:28:22.895 --> 02:28:26.023
<i>our present system must provide
a gentler means of redressing them</i>

02:28:26.106 --> 02:28:28.233
<i>- short of revolution.
- We've spawned a new race here.</i>

02:28:28.317 --> 02:28:29.526
<i>Rougher, simpler,</i>

02:28:29.610 --> 02:28:32.321
<i>more violent, more
enterprising, less refined.</i>

02:28:32.404 --> 02:28:35.866
<i>"My quartermaster has no food,
no arms, no ammunition,</i>

02:28:35.949 --> 02:28:38.660
<i>"and my troops are in a
state of near mutiny."</i>

02:28:38.744 --> 02:28:40.638
<i>- No army, no Navy...
- "I pray god some relief arrives</i>

02:28:40.662 --> 02:28:43.099
<i>- "before the armada, but fear it will not."
- No arms, no ammunition,</i>

02:28:43.123 --> 02:28:46.043
<i>- no treasury, no friends.
- And when they hang you, Mr. Adams,</i>

02:28:46.126 --> 02:28:48.629
<i>I do hope you'll put in a good word
for the rest of us.</i>

02:28:48.712 --> 02:28:51.840
<i>England closing in, cutting off our air.</i>

02:28:51.924 --> 02:28:52.925
<i>There's no time!</i>

02:28:53.008 --> 02:28:56.178
<i>To place before mankind
the common sense of the subject...</i>

02:28:56.261 --> 02:28:58.555
<i>The issue here is independence.</i>

02:28:58.639 --> 02:29:00.575
<i>Perhaps you've lost sight of that fact,
but I have not.</i>

02:29:00.599 --> 02:29:02.285
<i>"We mutually pledge to each other our lives</i>

02:29:02.309 --> 02:29:05.312
<i>"our fortunes and our sacred honor."</i>

02:29:06.063 --> 02:29:09.066
<i>Can you really know so
little about yourself?</i>

02:29:14.112 --> 02:29:15.447
Very well.

02:29:17.366 --> 02:29:21.537
The congress will now vote
on Virginia's resolution on independence.

02:29:29.545 --> 02:29:30.796
Thank you for coming, Caesar.

02:29:31.755 --> 02:29:33.507
God bless you, sir.

02:29:39.012 --> 02:29:41.181
The secretary will call the roll.

02:29:41.265 --> 02:29:44.226
And I remind you, gentlemen,

02:29:44.309 --> 02:29:46.478
that a single "nay" vote

02:29:47.604 --> 02:29:49.523
will defeat the motion.

02:29:50.816 --> 02:29:52.192
Mr. thomson.

02:29:57.364 --> 02:29:58.865
New Hampshire?

02:29:59.241 --> 02:30:00.409
New Hampshire says yea.

02:30:00.492 --> 02:30:02.995
New Hampshire says yea. Massachusetts?

02:30:03.078 --> 02:30:04.246
Massachusetts says yea.

02:30:04.329 --> 02:30:06.707
Massachusetts says yea. Rhode Island?

02:30:06.790 --> 02:30:08.125
Rhode Island says yea.

02:30:08.208 --> 02:30:10.752
Rhode Island says yea. Connecticut?

02:30:10.836 --> 02:30:12.045
Connecticut says yea.

02:30:12.129 --> 02:30:14.923
Connecticut says yea. New York?

02:30:15.007 --> 02:30:18.260
Mr. secretary,
New York abstains courteously.

02:30:18.343 --> 02:30:20.679
- New York abstains.
- Courteously.

02:30:22.097 --> 02:30:23.640
New Jersey?

02:30:23.724 --> 02:30:25.017
New Jersey says yea.

02:30:25.100 --> 02:30:27.686
New Jersey says yea. Pennsylvania?

02:30:29.688 --> 02:30:31.857
Mr. secretary, Pennsylvania is not ready.

02:30:31.940 --> 02:30:34.151
Please come back to us later.

02:30:34.234 --> 02:30:36.486
Pennsylvania passes. Delaware?

02:30:36.570 --> 02:30:37.613
Just a moment.

02:30:38.655 --> 02:30:41.908
Delaware, by majority vote...

02:30:42.492 --> 02:30:45.162
- Aye.
- Says yea.

02:30:45.245 --> 02:30:48.206
Delaware says yea. Maryland?

02:30:48.290 --> 02:30:49.499
Maryland says yea.

02:30:49.583 --> 02:30:51.209
Maryland says yea. Virginia?

02:30:51.293 --> 02:30:52.336
Virginia says yea.

02:30:52.419 --> 02:30:54.504
Virginia says yea. North Carolina?

02:30:54.588 --> 02:30:57.341
North Carolina yields to south Carolina.

02:30:58.592 --> 02:30:59.593
South Carolina?

02:31:00.594 --> 02:31:02.262
Well, Mr. Adams?

02:31:03.388 --> 02:31:04.681
Well, Mr. Rutledge.

02:31:07.768 --> 02:31:09.102
Mr. Adams,

02:31:11.605 --> 02:31:15.567
you must believe
that I will do what I promised to do.

02:31:22.324 --> 02:31:23.909
What is it you want, Rutledge?

02:31:23.992 --> 02:31:27.621
Remove the offending passage
from your declaration.

02:31:27.996 --> 02:31:30.123
If we did that, we would be guilty

02:31:30.207 --> 02:31:33.126
of what we ourselves are rebelling against.

02:31:35.087 --> 02:31:37.297
Nevertheless remove it,

02:31:38.048 --> 02:31:41.134
or south Carolina will bury now and forever

02:31:41.218 --> 02:31:43.303
your dream of independence.

02:31:44.346 --> 02:31:47.808
John, I beg you, consider
what you're doing.

02:31:54.773 --> 02:31:56.400
Mark me, Franklin,

02:31:57.526 --> 02:31:59.986
if we give in on this issue,

02:32:00.070 --> 02:32:02.572
posterity will never forgive us.

02:32:02.656 --> 02:32:04.741
That's probably true,
but we won't hear a thing.

02:32:04.825 --> 02:32:06.910
We'll be long gone.

02:32:06.993 --> 02:32:11.331
Besides, what will posterity think we were?
Demigods?

02:32:11.998 --> 02:32:13.583
We're men, no more, no less,

02:32:13.667 --> 02:32:16.545
trying to get a nation started
against greater odds

02:32:16.628 --> 02:32:19.506
than a more generous god
would have allowed.

02:32:20.132 --> 02:32:23.385
First things first, John.
Independence. America.

02:32:23.468 --> 02:32:25.929
If we don't secure that,

02:32:26.012 --> 02:32:28.515
what difference will the rest make?

02:32:34.646 --> 02:32:36.648
Jefferson, say something.

02:32:39.109 --> 02:32:41.111
What else is there to do?

02:32:42.028 --> 02:32:44.781
Well, man, you're the one that wrote it.

02:32:45.657 --> 02:32:48.785
I wrote all of it, Mr. Adams.

02:33:10.056 --> 02:33:11.266
There.

02:33:11.349 --> 02:33:14.120
There it is, Rutledge. You have your
slavery. Little good may it do you.

02:33:14.144 --> 02:33:16.062
You now vote, damn you!

02:33:17.647 --> 02:33:21.443
Mr. president,
the fair colony of south Carolina

02:33:22.736 --> 02:33:24.321
says yea.

02:33:24.404 --> 02:33:25.906
South Carolina says yea.

02:33:25.989 --> 02:33:27.491
North Carolina says yea.

02:33:27.574 --> 02:33:29.534
North Carolina says yea.

02:33:31.077 --> 02:33:32.162
Georgia?

02:33:32.245 --> 02:33:33.622
Georgia says yea.

02:33:33.705 --> 02:33:35.248
Georgia says yea.

02:33:36.583 --> 02:33:38.376
Pennsylvania, second call.

02:33:40.420 --> 02:33:42.255
Mr. president,

02:33:42.339 --> 02:33:45.509
Pennsylvania regrets
all of the inconvenience

02:33:45.592 --> 02:33:50.639
that such distinguished men
as Adams, Franklin and Jefferson

02:33:50.722 --> 02:33:52.557
were put to just now.

02:33:52.641 --> 02:33:54.434
They might've kept their document intact

02:33:54.518 --> 02:33:57.103
for all the difference it will make.

02:33:57.187 --> 02:33:58.814
Mr. president,

02:33:59.231 --> 02:34:00.607
Pennsylvania says...

02:34:00.690 --> 02:34:01.775
Just a moment.

02:34:03.443 --> 02:34:05.445
I ask the delegation to be polled.

02:34:06.196 --> 02:34:08.323
Dr. Franklin, don't be absurd.

02:34:08.782 --> 02:34:11.785
A poll, Mr. president.
It's a proper request.

02:34:12.035 --> 02:34:13.203
Yes, it is.

02:34:13.286 --> 02:34:15.580
Poll the delegation, Mr. thomson.

02:34:15.664 --> 02:34:17.374
Dr. Benjamin Franklin.

02:34:17.457 --> 02:34:18.500
Yea.

02:34:18.583 --> 02:34:20.544
Mr. John Dickinson.

02:34:20.627 --> 02:34:22.003
Nay.

02:34:22.087 --> 02:34:23.713
Mr. James Wilson.

02:34:26.925 --> 02:34:28.385
Judge Wilson?

02:34:31.555 --> 02:34:34.140
There it is, Mr. Wilson.
It's all up to you now.

02:34:34.224 --> 02:34:35.904
The whole question
of American independence

02:34:35.976 --> 02:34:38.562
rests squarely on your shoulders.

02:34:38.645 --> 02:34:42.190
An entirely new nation
ready to be born or to die at birth,

02:34:42.274 --> 02:34:43.984
all on your say-so.

02:34:45.110 --> 02:34:47.320
Which will it be, Mr. Wilson?

02:34:47.779 --> 02:34:51.324
Every mapmaker in the world
is waiting for your decision.

02:34:51.950 --> 02:34:55.078
Come now, James. Nothing has changed.

02:34:55.161 --> 02:34:57.914
We mustn't let Dr. Franklin
create one of his confusions.

02:34:57.998 --> 02:34:59.875
The question is clear.

02:35:00.375 --> 02:35:03.920
Most questions are clear
when someone else has to decide them.

02:35:04.004 --> 02:35:05.463
It would be a pity for a man

02:35:05.547 --> 02:35:08.091
who's handed down hundreds
of wise decisions

02:35:08.174 --> 02:35:10.010
from the bench

02:35:10.093 --> 02:35:13.263
to be remembered only
for the one unwise decision

02:35:13.346 --> 02:35:15.140
he made in congress.

02:35:16.600 --> 02:35:19.561
James, you're keeping everybody waiting.

02:35:19.644 --> 02:35:21.688
The secretary has called for your vote.

02:35:22.564 --> 02:35:23.773
Please.

02:35:25.108 --> 02:35:28.695
Don't push me, John.
I know what you want me to do.

02:35:31.448 --> 02:35:34.242
But Mr. Adams is correct about one thing.

02:35:36.745 --> 02:35:39.497
I'm the one who'll be remembered for it.

02:35:39.789 --> 02:35:40.874
What do you mean?

02:35:46.588 --> 02:35:48.798
I'm different from you, John.

02:35:49.633 --> 02:35:52.385
I'm different from most of the men here.

02:35:53.345 --> 02:35:55.555
I don't want to be remembered.

02:35:56.806 --> 02:35:58.767
I just don't want the

02:35:59.601 --> 02:36:01.144
responsibility.

02:36:02.270 --> 02:36:04.773
Yes, well, whether you
want it or not, James,

02:36:04.856 --> 02:36:07.108
there's no way of avoiding it.

02:36:07.192 --> 02:36:09.069
Not necessarily, John.

02:36:09.736 --> 02:36:11.738
If I go with them,

02:36:11.821 --> 02:36:14.074
I'll just be one among dozens.

02:36:15.909 --> 02:36:19.162
No one will ever remember
the name of James Wilson.

02:36:20.538 --> 02:36:22.415
But if I vote with you,

02:36:23.917 --> 02:36:27.253
I'll be the man
who prevented American independence.

02:36:30.090 --> 02:36:31.716
I'm sorry, John.

02:36:33.134 --> 02:36:35.428
I just didn't bargain for that.

02:36:37.013 --> 02:36:40.433
And is that how new nations are formed?

02:36:41.851 --> 02:36:44.354
By a nonentity trying to preserve

02:36:44.437 --> 02:36:47.732
the anonymity he so richly deserves?

02:36:48.608 --> 02:36:52.028
Revolutions come into this world
like bastard children, Mr. Dickinson.

02:36:52.112 --> 02:36:54.698
Half improvised and half compromised.

02:36:54.781 --> 02:36:57.200
Our side has provided the compromise.

02:36:57.283 --> 02:36:59.953
Now judge Wilson is supplying the rest.

02:37:04.124 --> 02:37:05.291
James.

02:37:06.835 --> 02:37:08.461
I'm sorry, John.

02:37:09.504 --> 02:37:10.714
My vote

02:37:11.923 --> 02:37:13.174
is yea.

02:37:13.967 --> 02:37:15.802
Mr. secretary, Pennsylvania says yea.

02:37:18.638 --> 02:37:22.267
The count being 12 to none

02:37:24.394 --> 02:37:25.729
with one abstention,

02:37:26.104 --> 02:37:28.314
the resolution on independence

02:37:30.275 --> 02:37:31.651
is adopted.

02:37:33.111 --> 02:37:34.446
It's done.

02:37:37.782 --> 02:37:39.117
It's done.

02:37:41.828 --> 02:37:43.204
Mr. thomson,

02:37:44.164 --> 02:37:45.749
is the declaration ready to be signed?

02:37:45.832 --> 02:37:47.459
It is.

02:37:47.542 --> 02:37:49.502
Then I suggest we do so.

02:37:51.337 --> 02:37:53.006
And the chair further proposes,

02:37:53.089 --> 02:37:55.800
for our mutual security and protection,

02:37:57.719 --> 02:37:59.679
that no man be allowed
to sit in this congress

02:37:59.763 --> 02:38:02.057
without attaching his name to it.

02:38:05.101 --> 02:38:07.979
I'm sorry, Mr. president.

02:38:09.439 --> 02:38:13.735
I cannot, in good conscience,
sign such a document.

02:38:15.361 --> 02:38:19.616
I will never stop hoping for our
eventual reconciliation with england.

02:38:21.284 --> 02:38:23.453
But because,

02:38:24.704 --> 02:38:26.206
in my own way,

02:38:27.207 --> 02:38:30.710
I regard America no less
than does Mr. Adams,

02:38:32.796 --> 02:38:36.674
I will join the army and
fight in her defense

02:38:38.218 --> 02:38:41.304
even though I believe
that fight to be hopeless.

02:38:46.976 --> 02:38:48.728
Goodbye, gentlemen.

02:38:50.814 --> 02:38:52.982
Gentlemen of the congress,

02:38:53.066 --> 02:38:55.401
I say yea, John Dickinson.

02:39:07.122 --> 02:39:08.456
Very well.

02:39:09.415 --> 02:39:11.167
Are there any objections to the declaration

02:39:11.251 --> 02:39:12.836
being approved as it now stands?

02:39:13.336 --> 02:39:14.462
I have one, Mr. hancock.

02:39:15.338 --> 02:39:16.881
You, Mr. Adams?

02:39:17.423 --> 02:39:19.509
Yes. Mr. Jefferson,

02:39:19.968 --> 02:39:24.097
it so happens that the
word is "unalienable,"

02:39:24.180 --> 02:39:25.974
not "inalienable."

02:39:27.684 --> 02:39:31.771
I'm sorry, Mr. Adams,
but "inalienable" is correct.

02:39:33.314 --> 02:39:36.484
I happen to be a Harvard graduate,
Mr. Jefferson.

02:39:39.612 --> 02:39:42.323
I attended William and Mary, Mr. Adams.

02:39:43.741 --> 02:39:44.993
Gentlemen, please!

02:39:45.076 --> 02:39:48.580
Mr. Jefferson,
will you yield to Mr. Adams' request?

02:39:50.915 --> 02:39:53.126
No, sir. Lwill not.

02:39:59.841 --> 02:40:01.718
Very well. I withdraw it.

02:40:02.260 --> 02:40:03.970
Good for you, John.

02:40:08.641 --> 02:40:11.102
I'll speak to the printer
about it later on.

02:40:13.688 --> 02:40:15.481
Very well, gentlemen.

02:40:16.024 --> 02:40:19.861
We're about to brave the storm
in a skiff made of paper.

02:40:21.070 --> 02:40:23.072
And how it shall end,

02:40:23.156 --> 02:40:24.699
god only knows.

02:40:26.701 --> 02:40:28.828
That's a pretty large signature, Johnny.

02:40:28.912 --> 02:40:31.998
So fat George in London
can read it without his glasses.

02:40:34.626 --> 02:40:38.963
All right, step right up, gentlemen.
Don't miss your chance to commit treason.

02:40:40.798 --> 02:40:44.844
Hancock is right.
This paper is our passport to the gallows.

02:40:44.928 --> 02:40:46.179
But there's no backing out now,

02:40:46.262 --> 02:40:47.489
for if we do not hang together,

02:40:47.513 --> 02:40:50.266
we shall most assuredly hang separately.

02:40:52.518 --> 02:40:55.063
In my case, hanging won't be so bad.

02:40:55.146 --> 02:40:58.274
One snap and it'll be all
over, just like that.

02:40:58.358 --> 02:40:59.776

Gentlemen, forgive me
if I don't join in the merriment,

02:41:08.076 --> 02:41:10.036
but if we are arrested now,

02:41:10.161 --> 02:41:13.248

on the damn thing!

02:41:33.726 --> 02:41:37.063
