WEBVTT

00:02.614 --> 00:04.573
Okay. Ahh.

00:04.574 --> 00:08.154
Um, my name is Alex Osbourne,

00:08.156 --> 00:11.825
and if you're watching this,
it means I'm dead.

00:11.826 --> 00:16.163
Or I'm just showing you.
Uh, but I'm probably dead.

00:16.164 --> 00:19.984
To my ex-wife Magda,
I leave herpes.

00:19.985 --> 00:21.852
But she knows that,
it's dealt with.

00:21.853 --> 00:24.271
As for my collection
of Styx albums,

00:24.272 --> 00:26.006
I leave that to no one.

00:26.007 --> 00:28.976
Because that's who appreciated
Styx as much as me.

00:28.977 --> 00:32.229
Finally, there's a kid named
Abed who makes movies

00:32.229 --> 00:35.583
at my community college,
and to him I leave the task

00:35.584 --> 00:37.668
of creating a video tribute
of my life.

00:37.669 --> 00:41.989
What follows is some general
purpose footage that he can use.

00:46.694 --> 00:48.295
Where did you get this?

00:48.296 --> 00:50.531
Some one-armed guy with a scar
on his face dropped it off.

00:50.532 --> 00:51.832
He said he was
Star-Burns' lawyer.

00:51.833 --> 00:54.508
How one-armed was he?
Tell me when to stop.

00:56.671 --> 00:58.939
- It was the other arm.
- You guys!

00:58.940 --> 01:00.875
I feel oddly compelled
to fulfill his request.

01:00.876 --> 01:02.476
Would you guys help me write
obituary copy?

01:02.477 --> 01:04.878
You mean like, "Star-Burns
died how he lived...

01:04.879 --> 01:06.380
in a meth lab explosion"?

01:06.381 --> 01:07.598
Can we turn this off?

01:07.599 --> 01:09.066
I'm not as comfortable
with death as you guys.

01:09.067 --> 01:13.170
- He's in a better place now.
- Yeah. The blu-ray shelf.

01:13.171 --> 01:14.455
What is that?

01:14.456 --> 01:16.273
Star-Burns also left me
his ashes.

01:16.274 --> 01:17.508
He requested they be burnt.

01:17.509 --> 01:18.809
I don't think he knows
how ashes work.

01:18.810 --> 01:20.160
The small one's his lizard.

01:20.161 --> 01:21.529
If we rub that,

01:21.530 --> 01:23.364
will he come out
and do celebrity impressions?

01:23.365 --> 01:25.731
- I don't think so.
- Then I want it out of here.

01:56.615 --> 02:00.067
You guys, how long are we
going to avoid talking

02:00.068 --> 02:02.570
about this really serious thing
that's happened?

02:02.571 --> 02:05.039
Is it always about
the Holocaust with you people?

02:05.040 --> 02:08.108
I'm talking about Star-Burns,
you know, dying.

02:08.109 --> 02:10.661
I know it's sad, but death
is a natural part of life

02:10.662 --> 02:12.062
and by the time
I finish this sentence,

02:12.063 --> 02:13.581
100 people will have
died in China.

02:13.582 --> 02:17.751
Why did you stop talking?

02:17.752 --> 02:19.253
I have to call my pen pal.

02:19.254 --> 02:20.738
Star-Burns was a good man.

02:20.739 --> 02:22.756
He barely sued me that time
I ran over his foot.

02:22.757 --> 02:24.892
I say we honor Star-Burns
by discussing him

02:24.893 --> 02:26.510
the same amount we did
when he was alive.

02:26.511 --> 02:28.762
Jeff, have some respect.

02:28.763 --> 02:30.981
He might have been
a scuzzy weirdo

02:30.982 --> 02:32.966
who shaved his sideburns
into star shapes...

02:32.967 --> 02:33.984
Pai Mai?

02:33.985 --> 02:36.470
It's Troy.
Are you okay?

02:36.471 --> 02:38.906
Okay, good, I gotta go.
This costs $7.

02:38.907 --> 02:43.661
But he was also a classmate,
a kinda sorta friend sometimes

02:43.662 --> 02:45.746
and above all, a human being.

02:45.747 --> 02:47.247
He touched all our lives.

02:47.248 --> 02:48.415
Annie has a point.

02:48.416 --> 02:50.651
The death of a peer,
especially at our age,

02:50.652 --> 02:52.836
can trigger a whole
range of emotions.

02:52.837 --> 02:54.838
- As a psychologist...
- Student.

02:54.839 --> 02:56.823
- I hereby offer my licensed...
- Unlicensed.

02:56.824 --> 02:57.991
Services as a grief counselor.

02:57.992 --> 03:00.010
- Grief causer.
- If anyone needs to talk,

03:00.011 --> 03:01.595
- the doctor...
- Not even close.

03:01.596 --> 03:02.880
Is in.

03:02.881 --> 03:05.299
Britta, I could use some help
dealing with my grief.

03:05.300 --> 03:06.333
- Great.
- Yeah.

03:06.334 --> 03:11.338
I was hoping you'd say that,
because... I came prepared.

03:12.774 --> 03:14.341
You seemed smarter
than me when I met you.

03:14.342 --> 03:15.342
Thank you.

03:15.343 --> 03:17.061
For the purposes
of this exercise,

03:17.062 --> 03:19.763
I am Star-Burns.

03:19.764 --> 03:22.282
Tell me the things you never got
a chance to say to me.

03:25.820 --> 03:28.489
Come on, guys,
you can ask me anything.

03:28.490 --> 03:29.540
What's heaven like?

03:29.541 --> 03:32.025
Uh, I don't know.
Glittery.

03:32.026 --> 03:34.328
- Ask me something else.
- Have you seen Tim Russert?

03:34.329 --> 03:37.197
Guys, you are doing this wrong.
Ask me something personal.

03:37.198 --> 03:38.615
Star-Burns,
I didn't know you that well,

03:38.616 --> 03:40.084
but why did you smell
exactly like salami?

03:40.085 --> 03:42.419
- Abed.
- I got one. Where's my comb?

03:42.420 --> 03:44.004
- I don't know.
- Yep, it's him.

03:44.005 --> 03:45.839
Why did you tape that
switchblade to your ankle?

03:45.840 --> 03:47.541
Why did you always poop
with the stall door open?

03:47.542 --> 03:48.726
Is it true you made out
with Britta?

03:48.727 --> 03:49.893
I don't see
how that's relevant.

03:49.894 --> 03:51.478
It was Fat Neil's
black light party.

03:51.479 --> 03:53.931
Vicki saw you.
If that's true...

03:53.932 --> 03:57.735
if... maybe it was because
she was really drunk

03:57.736 --> 03:58.885
and she had just found out

03:58.886 --> 04:00.754
that her first boyfriend
was getting married.

04:00.755 --> 04:02.239
If you guys are gonna
do this wrong,

04:02.240 --> 04:03.657
then I'm gonna take these off.

04:03.658 --> 04:05.409
Ow!

04:05.410 --> 04:06.860
Okay, grief counseling
is growing on me.

- Ben, how's it "deaning"?
- Can't "com-Chang."

04:23.595 --> 04:27.131
- Just needed you to sign this.
- Okay.

04:27.132 --> 04:31.685
Let's just... give this
a little look-a-roo.

04:31.686 --> 04:34.138
"Request for increased
security."

04:34.139 --> 04:35.756
"Cool new uniforms."
I like that.

04:35.757 --> 04:38.525
"Power to enact martial law,"
not so much.

04:38.526 --> 04:41.445
"Indefinite detention,
pepper spray,

04:41.446 --> 04:45.399
involuntary cavity searches...

04:45.400 --> 04:47.534
All liquids and gels
must be in sealed bottles

04:47.535 --> 04:48.819
no larger than 3 ounces.

04:48.820 --> 04:51.438
I'm sorry, Chang,
this stuff is too extreme.

04:51.439 --> 04:54.041
This is a community college,
not an inner-city High School.

04:54.042 --> 04:56.126
It's a community college
where a degenerate

04:56.127 --> 04:58.412
just blew himself up
with stolen lab equipment.

04:58.413 --> 05:00.414
To be fair,
it was the crystal meth

05:00.415 --> 05:03.417
inside the stolen lab equipment
that blew him up.

05:03.418 --> 05:05.285
That's the problem with you
civilian suits.

05:05.286 --> 05:07.387
You want the results,
but you don't want to know

05:07.388 --> 05:08.672
how the sausage gets made.

05:08.673 --> 05:10.624
Well, I'll tell you
how the sausage gets made.

05:10.625 --> 05:12.959
It's a lot of ground meat and it
gets stuffed into a casing

05:12.960 --> 05:15.295
that looks like a cross between
a dude's dong and a poop.

05:15.296 --> 05:18.065
I don't know how that helps
me, but please leave.

05:18.066 --> 05:20.100
Fine, but you will regret this.

05:20.101 --> 05:23.353
I doubt it.

05:23.354 --> 05:25.355
This just came for you.

05:27.609 --> 05:29.276
Great.

05:29.277 --> 05:32.479
I have to give more bad news
to Jeff and his study group.

05:32.480 --> 05:35.181
Hold my calls,
I have to pick an outfit.

05:38.453 --> 05:41.789
Who wants to dance?

05:41.790 --> 05:43.824
Nice work, everyone.

05:43.825 --> 05:47.160
Now think about that last
little puppy in that basket

05:47.161 --> 05:49.463
out of all those puppies.

05:49.464 --> 05:52.683
And now...
he's catching fire too.

05:54.469 --> 05:57.604
Britta! Why are you making us
feel these things?

05:57.605 --> 05:59.339
We need to bring
our emotions to the surface

05:59.340 --> 06:00.607
and explore them.

06:00.608 --> 06:02.176
Does it always
have to be puppies though?

06:02.177 --> 06:03.694
Oh, come on, everybody.

06:03.695 --> 06:05.696
This is a completely
unnecessary process.

06:05.697 --> 06:07.447
What Jeff's doing right now
is called denial

06:07.448 --> 06:09.516
and it is the first
of five stages of grief

06:09.517 --> 06:11.518
that ends with acceptance.

06:11.519 --> 06:13.453
- Name any other stage.
- What are you, my final?

06:13.454 --> 06:15.489
Maybe we don't need
grief counseling.

06:15.490 --> 06:17.190
But seems like
the least we could do

06:17.191 --> 06:18.826
is have a memorial
or something.

06:18.827 --> 06:21.161
Oh, yes, we could
have a little service

06:21.162 --> 06:22.546
and I could bring
some of my brownies

06:22.547 --> 06:24.464
<i>and I guess someone
should sing Ave Maria.</i>

06:24.465 --> 06:26.083
I mean,
I can do it. Whatever.

06:26.084 --> 06:27.868
Sure, why not
drag it out for weeks?

06:27.869 --> 06:30.003
Why not wallow
for the rest of our lives

06:30.004 --> 06:31.371
and never get anything done?

06:31.372 --> 06:35.142
Or we could just admit
the simple fact that one day,

06:35.143 --> 06:38.712
something is in your life
and one day, it's not.

06:38.713 --> 06:41.815
<i>Dean-jour, mes amis!</i>

06:41.816 --> 06:43.233
Unfortunately, due to the whole

06:43.234 --> 06:45.269
Star-Burns
meth lab explosion,

06:45.270 --> 06:47.154
Professor Kane has resigned,

06:47.155 --> 06:49.940
and you biology class
has been can-can-cancelled.

06:52.493 --> 06:53.994
Your grade is now
an incomplete.

06:53.995 --> 06:55.896
You'll have to make up
the credit in the summer.

06:59.784 --> 07:04.504
My summer is gone?

07:04.505 --> 07:06.506
No.

07:06.507 --> 07:10.711
No!

07:10.712 --> 07:12.045
Well, I had a little

07:12.046 --> 07:13.914
rockette kick-line thing
planned, but...

Uh, now, Shirley,
I understand you wanted

07:51.651 --> 07:53.685
- to sing something as well?
- No, thank you.

07:53.686 --> 07:56.187
Okay, then let's move on
to the eulogies.

07:56.188 --> 07:57.989
Does anyone have anything
they wanna say

07:57.990 --> 07:59.624
in the memory of Star-Burns?

07:59.625 --> 08:04.429
Oh... Because his sideburns
were shaped like stars.

08:04.430 --> 08:06.881
I just got it.
I just got that.

08:06.882 --> 08:07.933
Anything at all.

08:07.934 --> 08:10.302
This is a safe place to say

08:10.303 --> 08:12.053
- what you're feeling.
- I'll say something.

08:12.054 --> 08:13.838
Oh, oh.

08:17.343 --> 08:20.629
After learning about
Star-Burns' death,

08:20.630 --> 08:24.349
I personally went through
the stages of grief

08:24.350 --> 08:25.934
and have now arrived

08:25.935 --> 08:28.570
at the final one...
acceptance.

08:28.571 --> 08:29.821
Whoo! Closure!

08:29.822 --> 08:31.790
Acceptance that this place...

08:31.791 --> 08:35.777
This fallujah
of higher learning...

08:35.778 --> 08:39.080
is a prison from which
none of us will ever escape.

08:39.081 --> 08:40.832
Okay, Jeffrey, now we're
mixing metaphors here...

08:40.832 --> 08:43.368
And it turns out...

08:43.369 --> 08:47.422
that Star-Burns,
this man in this urn,

08:47.423 --> 08:51.376
was a hero to us the whole time
because he did the one thing

08:51.377 --> 08:54.763
that none of us
ever tried to do.

08:54.764 --> 08:56.891
He got out.

08:58.684 --> 09:01.236
And then he exploded.

09:01.237 --> 09:04.055
Because Greendale
hates its students.

09:04.056 --> 09:05.440
No. No.

09:05.441 --> 09:06.741
It sucks the lives
from their bodies

09:06.742 --> 09:08.743
and forces
their desiccated husks

09:08.744 --> 09:10.528
to attend summer school.

09:10.529 --> 09:12.563
Okay, Jeffrey,
this is a funeral.

09:12.564 --> 09:13.665
Let's keep it light.

09:13.666 --> 09:15.583
Annie, Annie,
maybe you could say

09:15.584 --> 09:17.735
something nice
about Star-Burns.

09:17.736 --> 09:19.788
Get some sugar
to go with that spice.

09:19.789 --> 09:21.790
Way to go, Jeff.

09:24.543 --> 09:28.346
Star-Burns or Alex,
as he like to be called,

09:28.347 --> 09:30.382
was a human being.

09:30.383 --> 09:32.634
A Greendale human being...

09:32.635 --> 09:36.021
Like me.

09:36.022 --> 09:39.357
I've given this place
my childhood,

09:39.358 --> 09:42.444
my enthusiasm, and my loyalty,

09:42.445 --> 09:45.430
and in return,
Greendale has warped me

09:45.431 --> 09:47.532
like a Barbie in a microwave.

09:47.533 --> 09:51.269
Our school flag is an anus!

09:51.270 --> 09:52.454
You were the guys who drew it.

09:52.455 --> 09:53.822
We're not even the best

09:53.823 --> 09:56.708
community college
in our community.

09:56.709 --> 09:59.210
Let that sink in.

09:59.211 --> 10:03.665
And the cherry on top on this
total lack of sundae...

10:03.666 --> 10:08.837
I'm failing a remedial biology
class on a technicality

10:08.838 --> 10:12.123
all because you don't know
how to run a school.

10:12.124 --> 10:14.476
- Oh, that's...
- Shame on you, Dean.

10:14.477 --> 10:17.228
Shame... on... you!

10:17.229 --> 10:19.681
Edison out.

10:23.402 --> 10:24.686
Wow.

10:24.687 --> 10:29.741
Let's maybe not drop
the $50 mics, okay, guys?

10:29.742 --> 10:31.709
Shirley, you love Jesus.

10:31.710 --> 10:33.644
I think we all could use

10:33.645 --> 10:36.448
some good old-fashioned
religion right now.

10:37.950 --> 10:40.585
Well, uh, all right.

10:40.586 --> 10:42.871
Um, Star-Burns, I'm told,

10:42.872 --> 10:44.773
um, was a drug dealer.

10:44.774 --> 10:46.758
Which, of course,
is not good behavior.

10:46.759 --> 10:48.659
Which... but he...
it was a business.

10:48.660 --> 10:51.129
Um, he had
an entrepreneurial spirit.

10:51.130 --> 10:52.797
Amen.

10:52.798 --> 10:54.849
I had an entrepreneurial
spirit.

10:54.850 --> 10:56.801
I had dreams.

10:56.802 --> 11:00.605
Dreams of opening a sandwich
shop in this cafeteria.

11:00.606 --> 11:03.274
And Greendale listened
to those dreams...

11:03.275 --> 11:05.143
And stole them...

11:05.144 --> 11:08.179
And sold them to Subway.

11:13.736 --> 11:15.520
Worst wake ever.

11:15.521 --> 11:17.355
I'm starting to get nervous
about this.

11:17.356 --> 11:20.208
Yep, it'd be nice to have
some protection, right?

11:20.209 --> 11:24.295
Think maybe it's about
time you signed this?

11:24.296 --> 11:28.299
Just promise me
you'll use restraint.

11:28.300 --> 11:30.385
Yep. Every type we got.

11:30.386 --> 11:34.339
- Gentlemen!
- All hail Chang!

11:34.340 --> 11:36.491
This is the day we've been
waiting for.

11:36.492 --> 11:37.892
Suit... up!

11:39.395 --> 11:41.679
♪ When I say Greendale,
you say sucks ♪

11:41.680 --> 11:45.817
- * Greendale *
- * Sucks *

11:45.818 --> 11:48.219
- * Greendale *
- * Sucks *

11:48.220 --> 11:49.737
- Peace.
- Boo boo boo.

11:49.738 --> 11:52.890
No, no, no, no,
no, no, oh, no, you don't.

11:54.393 --> 11:57.662
Look, I don't know how this
got out of hand either.

11:57.663 --> 12:01.749
But as a student who's been
at Greendale for over a decade,

12:01.750 --> 12:05.703
I think I've earned the right
to say a few final words.

12:05.704 --> 12:08.840
Let him talk!

12:08.841 --> 12:13.261
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you, thank you.

12:13.262 --> 12:15.913
Let's burn this mother down!

12:15.914 --> 12:19.250
Yeah!

12:19.251 --> 12:22.253
Helter skelter!

12:22.254 --> 12:23.271
No, no, no!

12:29.562 --> 12:33.097
I'm gonna take everything
but onions and olives.

12:33.098 --> 12:36.034
I know my comb's in here,
you son of a bitch!

12:45.127 --> 12:49.080
Look, tiny riot gear.
Aww.

12:55.671 --> 12:59.757
It's so peppery!

12:59.758 --> 13:02.594
Oh, no.

13:14.439 --> 13:17.825
Strange, I'm not finding any
pepper spray on you.

13:17.826 --> 13:19.127
Well, check harder.

13:19.128 --> 13:21.496
It's not like I'm crying
because I was chased

13:21.497 --> 13:23.881
by the gang
of scary 12-year-olds.

13:23.882 --> 13:26.718
No entry, we're guarding
General Chang's prisoners.

13:26.719 --> 13:27.919
Okay, this is my school,

13:27.920 --> 13:30.171
and I will enter
whatever I want.

13:30.172 --> 13:32.924
Well, Subway has threatened
to pull out of Greendale

13:32.925 --> 13:34.926
and the school board
is furious.

13:34.927 --> 13:37.562
Tomorrow, they are having
a hearing to investigate

13:37.563 --> 13:42.633
the ringleaders of the riot,
aka the Greendale Seven.

13:42.634 --> 13:44.152
Catchy.

13:44.153 --> 13:46.270
How about Pierce Hawthorne
and the Greendale Six?

13:46.271 --> 13:49.807
- Pierce!
- How about the Greendale Five?

13:49.808 --> 13:53.027
- I'm such a bad Dean.
- No, you're not.

13:53.028 --> 13:54.311
Well, you are.

13:54.312 --> 13:57.198
But...
We're worse students.

13:57.199 --> 13:58.916
While you tried to save
Greendale,

13:58.917 --> 14:00.985
we trashed the school
like a TV commercial

14:00.986 --> 14:02.587
where the teacher
banned skittles.

14:02.588 --> 14:05.089
That's sweet of you
to say, Jeffrey.

14:05.090 --> 14:07.992
But it doesn't change the fact
that we're all Ted Danson

14:07.993 --> 14:09.460
at Whoopie Goldberg's roast.

14:09.461 --> 14:13.214
What if we all back
each other up to the board

14:13.215 --> 14:15.600
and explain the we were
all experiencing

14:15.601 --> 14:17.385
"funeral crazies"?

14:17.386 --> 14:20.188
I can say that's a thing
because I'm a psych major.

14:20.189 --> 14:23.674
Ugh, they're still
going to need a fall guy.

14:23.675 --> 14:25.443
How about the crazy man who...

14:25.444 --> 14:30.448
commanded a bunch of preteens
to spray poison in our faces?

14:30.449 --> 14:32.483
You know what?

14:32.484 --> 14:36.120
It was right under our noses,
wasn't it?

14:36.121 --> 14:37.789
Group hug...

14:37.790 --> 14:39.540
Where I'm between
Jeff and Troy.

14:39.541 --> 14:42.493
Here we go... oop, you're
walking away from the hug.

14:48.250 --> 14:49.751
Hey there, Ben.

14:49.752 --> 14:51.919
Would you mind scooching
from my desk?

14:51.920 --> 14:54.055
Got some testimony
to get prepared

14:54.056 --> 14:56.373
for the school board
meeting tomorrowsies.

14:56.374 --> 14:58.342
That testimony wouldn't
happen to involve

14:58.343 --> 14:59.894
pinning the riot on me.

14:59.895 --> 15:03.231
Ben, I'm sorry,
but this has gone too far.

15:03.232 --> 15:05.883
I regret issuing those
extraordinary powers to you.

15:05.884 --> 15:08.385
I regret letting this child army
get out of hand.

15:08.386 --> 15:11.055
I regret giving you that
unasked for adult back rub

15:11.056 --> 15:12.523
when you were asleep
that once.

15:14.109 --> 15:15.359
I think we're gonna
have to let you go.

15:15.360 --> 15:16.861
Nuh-uh, ain't happening.

15:16.862 --> 15:19.013
I always knew this
day would come.

15:19.014 --> 15:23.034
Now the only person getting
replaced around here is you.

15:25.003 --> 15:27.004
Oh, my God, it's me.

15:27.005 --> 15:31.509
Ugh! I will...

15:31.510 --> 15:35.546
The single worst wake riot
this district has ever seen.

15:35.547 --> 15:37.882
And we've seen our share.

15:37.883 --> 15:42.419
Tables, chairs, floors,
ceilings, all affected.

15:42.420 --> 15:46.858
A campus already in mourning
is pushed into chaos.

15:46.859 --> 15:48.926
And sitting here facing me now,

15:48.927 --> 15:51.028
the so-called
Greendale Seven...

15:51.029 --> 15:53.614
Reportedly responsible
for inciting

15:53.615 --> 15:55.616
the entire chain of events.

15:55.617 --> 15:59.770
This is some
pretty serious stuff.

16:01.606 --> 16:07.712
Sir... Although my friends and I
behaved somewhat irresponsibly,

16:07.713 --> 16:11.716
we shouldn't forget about
the circumstances on campus.

16:11.717 --> 16:13.835
We had just lost a classmate.

16:13.836 --> 16:19.507
And a lizard...
Your Majesty.

16:19.508 --> 16:22.960
It was an emotional time
and we acted emotionally.

16:22.961 --> 16:26.981
But the real question is,
how did the school respond?

16:26.982 --> 16:31.853
The riot was exacerbated
by the school security staff's

16:31.854 --> 16:34.906
heavy-handed and, frankly,
insane response.

16:34.907 --> 16:37.191
Hey, everyone.

16:37.192 --> 16:38.693
Oh, so sorry
to pop in like this.

16:38.694 --> 16:39.994
I really hope I'm not
interrupting.

16:39.995 --> 16:41.329
Just wanted to see how
everything's going,

16:41.330 --> 16:44.115
and those are for you fellas.

16:44.116 --> 16:46.083
I never forget a face
or a favorite cookie.

16:46.084 --> 16:48.319
And I brought extras,
because I know how Richie

16:48.320 --> 16:50.872
got into that
last basket I brought.

16:50.873 --> 16:53.207
Probably good to have a backup.

16:53.208 --> 16:55.927
I did. I did get into
them pretty good.

16:55.928 --> 16:58.329
So everything going okay?

16:58.330 --> 16:59.931
Or are you guys going to
trash this building too?

16:59.932 --> 17:02.266
Yeah, we were just going
over the charges.

17:02.267 --> 17:04.602
Seems like you had your hands
full with these individuals.

17:04.603 --> 17:06.186
This is crazy.

17:06.188 --> 17:08.271
- You guys are really buying this?
- Excuse me?

17:08.272 --> 17:10.942
Chang is a psychopathic
wannabe warlord

17:10.943 --> 17:13.611
with an army
of prepubescent thugs.

17:13.612 --> 17:16.146
He was living in the school's
air vent system

17:16.147 --> 17:17.531
with a monkey!

17:17.531 --> 17:18.782
That's not...

17:18.784 --> 17:20.517
Well, where's the Dean?
He'll tell you.

17:20.518 --> 17:22.869
Hey, guys.
Can't stay, gotta run,

17:22.871 --> 17:25.873
but, uh, these troublemakers
have got to go.

17:28.377 --> 17:30.027
I think I've heard enough,

17:30.028 --> 17:32.613
and I don't see
what choice I have.

17:32.614 --> 17:34.131
Greendale Seven...

17:34.132 --> 17:35.333
Jeff Winger,

17:35.334 --> 17:36.334
Annie Edison,

17:36.335 --> 17:37.335
Pierce Hawthorne,

17:37.336 --> 17:38.469
Britta Perry,

17:38.470 --> 17:39.470
Shirley Bennet,

17:39.471 --> 17:40.838
Abed Nadir,

17:40.839 --> 17:42.223
Troy Barnes,

17:42.224 --> 17:46.560
you are hereby expelled from
Greendale Community College.

17:46.561 --> 17:50.348
May God have mercy
on your souls.

17:50.349 --> 17:52.934
Rusty bucket?
Rusty bucket?

17:52.935 --> 17:54.068
- Rusty bucket?
- Yep.

17:54.069 --> 17:56.354
Okay, transform and roll out.

18:02.845 --> 18:06.164
13 years of college
down the drain.

18:06.165 --> 18:07.415
I was gonna be
the first one in my family

18:07.416 --> 18:09.834
to graduate from
community college.

18:09.835 --> 18:12.087
Everyone else graduated
from normal college.

18:12.088 --> 18:15.707
Now they're really gonna
give me a hard time.

18:15.708 --> 18:17.342
You're drinking?

18:17.343 --> 18:19.311
Yeah, well, my life can't
get double ruined.

18:19.312 --> 18:22.547
Can't believe we're expelled.
Greendale was our home.

18:22.548 --> 18:24.266
Britta, isn't it time
for you to explain

18:24.267 --> 18:25.800
that every failure
is also an opportunity?

18:25.801 --> 18:28.153
- Whatever, I'm the worst.
- I'm also the worst.

18:28.154 --> 18:31.022
Not gonna argue,
but I am gonna forgive you.

18:31.023 --> 18:33.775
That's the pizza.

18:33.776 --> 18:36.561
Roll a die to see who gets it?

18:36.562 --> 18:37.862
I'll get it.

18:37.863 --> 18:41.266
You guys remember our
housewarming party?

18:41.267 --> 18:42.534
What would have happened
if I had just let Jeff

18:42.535 --> 18:43.602
roll the die that night?

18:43.603 --> 18:45.086
I assumed this was
the best timeline,

18:45.087 --> 18:46.121
but what if it's the darkest?

18:46.122 --> 18:47.238
Well, I don't
think anyone knows

18:47.239 --> 18:48.239
what you're talking about,

18:48.240 --> 18:51.104
but it does seem like things
couldn't get any worse.

18:57.750 --> 19:00.251
No.

19:00.252 --> 19:02.103
We're all gonna
get through this.

19:02.104 --> 19:04.689
We're all alive
and we're all fine.

19:04.690 --> 19:08.693
And Britta,
you're not the worst.

19:08.694 --> 19:12.364
You're the best.

19:12.365 --> 19:14.932
He's right.
Things are bad.

19:14.933 --> 19:17.569
But we're together.

19:17.570 --> 19:19.037
That makes this
the perfect timeline.

19:19.038 --> 19:21.439
Wait.
There are other timelines?

19:28.748 --> 19:30.749
Pizza time.
