WEBVTT

00:01.935 --> 00:03.469
<i>Previously on</i> legends...

00:03.471 --> 00:04.870
Think martin odum is
a material witness

00:04.872 --> 00:06.271
To a brutal homicide.

00:06.273 --> 00:07.940
I have a duty to follow
that case wherever it goes.

00:07.942 --> 00:10.275
The case he is on is a hell
of a lot more important.

00:10.277 --> 00:13.445
Literally thousands of lives
could be at stake. Back off.

00:13.447 --> 00:15.647
We've got a weapons-grade
nerve agent out there,

00:15.649 --> 00:18.484
Which is why the op has been
escalated to level one priority.

00:18.486 --> 00:20.152
Half the city
is in the kill zone.

00:20.154 --> 00:21.787
Gates:
<i>Yuri medved-- he was a chechen</i>

00:21.789 --> 00:23.622
Resistance colonel in
the first chechen war...

00:23.624 --> 00:25.724
In the '90s,
he was rumored to be the source

00:25.726 --> 00:26.959
Of some black market
nerve agents...

00:26.961 --> 00:28.827
(door opens)
what do they want?

00:28.829 --> 00:31.230
I used to be a chemist
for the russian military.

00:31.232 --> 00:33.165
Kitson: Richard hubbard was
actively involved in russia's

00:33.167 --> 00:34.700
Chemical weapons program.

00:34.702 --> 00:37.336
Gates: <i>This is probably martin's</i>
<i>most productive legend.</i>

00:37.338 --> 00:39.505
Maggie: <i>Dante auerbach--</i>
<i>british arms dealer.</i>

00:39.507 --> 00:41.073
Gates:
Odum has been in legend a week,

00:41.075 --> 00:42.541
And he's already
penetrated the network.

00:42.543 --> 00:45.744
The vx has high persistence
in the environment.

00:47.347 --> 00:48.680
Gates:
Any sign of the vx?

00:48.682 --> 00:50.482
Nothing. It looks like
they took it all.

00:50.484 --> 00:51.750
<i>It's up to martin now.</i>

00:51.752 --> 00:54.253
A single drop is enough to kill.

00:54.255 --> 00:56.922
(muffled shouting)

01:01.261 --> 01:04.229
(muffled shouting)

01:06.166 --> 01:08.000
(shouting stops)

01:08.002 --> 01:10.235
(body thumps on floor)

01:12.005 --> 01:14.073
(sighs)

01:18.344 --> 01:20.746
Now we have trust.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.694
So, how much
have you got?

01:35.696 --> 01:39.198
I have five liters
of concentrated

01:39.200 --> 01:42.034
Weapon-grade
vx nerve agent.

01:42.036 --> 01:45.370
I'll buy it all-- market rate.

01:45.372 --> 01:46.872
$20 million.

01:46.874 --> 01:49.041
The product is already
in the country.

01:49.043 --> 01:51.243
I assume that's why
you came here to buy it--

01:51.245 --> 01:52.611
You have no
smuggling expenses.

01:52.613 --> 01:55.247
I buy it in risk
of exposure-- 30.

01:55.249 --> 01:57.883
35.

01:57.885 --> 02:00.319
32. That's it.

02:00.321 --> 02:01.720
I get ten percent now.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.989
Not a problem,
as long as it's done quickly.

02:03.991 --> 02:05.791
My clients seem to be
on a schedule.

02:05.793 --> 02:07.759
We can make the
exchange tomorrow.

02:07.761 --> 02:09.094
Good.

02:09.096 --> 02:12.097
From now on, no electronic
communication between us.

02:12.099 --> 02:15.400
No texts, calls,
e-mails, nothing.

02:15.402 --> 02:17.536
I need a flash drive
with your bank routing numbers.

02:20.673 --> 02:22.875
Pleasure, mr. Auerbach.

02:28.281 --> 02:30.349
(chandelier jingling)

02:53.139 --> 02:55.274
Hubbard:
<i>Medved threatened my family.</i>

02:55.276 --> 02:58.010
He held a gun to my
daughter's head, and my wife's.

02:58.012 --> 03:00.679
You had no choice, we know that.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.781
How much vx did you make?

03:02.783 --> 03:03.882
Five liters.

03:03.884 --> 03:05.851
An aerosolized batch of

03:05.853 --> 03:07.786
One of those liters
could kill 1,000 people.

03:07.788 --> 03:10.522
Do you understand
this man?

03:10.524 --> 03:13.192
He ordered the use of
nerve agent in chechnya.

03:13.194 --> 03:16.161
He exterminated
an entire village.

03:16.163 --> 03:17.696
The russians covered it up.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.131
It wasn't even
a strategic location,

03:19.133 --> 03:20.365
It was a testing ground,

03:20.367 --> 03:22.401
Because he was curious.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.469
The man is evil.

03:24.471 --> 03:26.638
If he's backed
into a corner,

03:26.640 --> 03:27.839
He'll use the vx agent.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.074
He doesn't care.

03:31.010 --> 03:32.644
Reporter:
<i>We are taking you now</i>

03:32.646 --> 03:34.880
To where fbi agents
made a dramatic raid

03:34.882 --> 03:36.181
On a warehouse just south of...

03:36.183 --> 03:37.583
My god, yuri, turn on the news.

03:37.585 --> 03:39.218
I'm watching.

03:39.220 --> 03:41.253
Why didn't your men tell us
it was happening last night?

03:41.255 --> 03:44.156
Police must've disabled
communications

03:44.158 --> 03:45.991
Before they went in.

03:45.993 --> 03:48.093
They're probably questioning
the scientist as we speak.

03:48.095 --> 03:50.862
I was gonna have to
dispose of him anyway.

03:50.864 --> 03:52.030
He knows who you are.

03:52.032 --> 03:54.266
Interpol knows
who I am for 20 years;

03:54.268 --> 03:56.435
They haven't found me yet.

03:56.437 --> 03:57.436
We need to move.

03:57.438 --> 03:59.771
The fbi are getting close.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.873
Calm yourself down, my dear.

04:01.875 --> 04:05.277
Nothing in that warehouse
tracks back to us.

04:05.279 --> 04:07.779
We'll do the deal with
mr. Auerbach as planned.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.581
Then we leave.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.183
We need to be smart here.

04:11.185 --> 04:13.952
We don't know dante, not really.

04:13.954 --> 04:16.054
I still don't know
if he can be trusted.

04:16.056 --> 04:17.889
You said you had doubts.

04:17.891 --> 04:19.858
Not after what he did

04:19.860 --> 04:22.294
Last night.

04:24.697 --> 04:26.798
(device beeping)

04:35.908 --> 04:37.843
The colonel
will be in touch.

04:41.214 --> 04:42.781
Lovely.

04:47.654 --> 04:50.489
Welcome home,
mr. Auerbach.

04:53.059 --> 04:54.793
Resident in the house.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.161
Solo occupant.

04:56.163 --> 04:58.196
Copy, gatekeeper.

05:00.333 --> 05:02.567
Martin just made contact.
He's home.

05:02.569 --> 05:04.569
About goddamn time.

05:04.571 --> 05:06.004
The deal is on.

05:06.006 --> 05:08.240
We're just waiting on
details for the exchange.

05:08.242 --> 05:09.274
We probably won't
have a location

05:09.276 --> 05:10.275
Until the last
final minute.

05:10.277 --> 05:11.576
Well, you can count on that.

05:11.578 --> 05:13.312
Uh, you and your team
gonna be ready?

05:13.314 --> 05:14.346
Prepping now.

05:14.348 --> 05:15.781
Good.

05:15.783 --> 05:17.349
Sounds like things
are going better.

05:17.351 --> 05:19.251
"things"?

05:19.253 --> 05:20.352
Between you and martin.

05:21.287 --> 05:23.121
(sighs)

05:23.123 --> 05:25.257
I am going to enjoy this.

05:25.259 --> 05:27.159
Sir?

05:27.161 --> 05:28.694
The part where you tell me
I was right.

05:28.696 --> 05:31.063
Mm.

05:32.498 --> 05:35.867
It's been a while since we've
been on a case together...

05:35.869 --> 05:36.868
Mm-hmm.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.203
...But to work
with him so closely--

05:38.205 --> 05:40.105
He's good.

05:40.107 --> 05:42.140
And?

05:42.142 --> 05:44.309
And you were right.

05:44.311 --> 05:45.877
(sighs):
Ah.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.212
Thank you.

05:47.214 --> 05:49.114
(chuckles)
now get out.

05:55.221 --> 05:57.222
Oh, I am in some shit.

05:57.224 --> 05:59.157
And down
the rabbit hole we go.

05:59.159 --> 06:00.525
No, no, listen,
I am serious, okay?

06:00.527 --> 06:02.361
I am getting close
to something here.

06:02.363 --> 06:03.962
Yeah. The murder
of the homeless guy.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.063
You find your smoking gun?

06:05.065 --> 06:06.465
You tell me, okay?

06:06.467 --> 06:08.033
Nelson gates,
the head of the dco,

06:08.035 --> 06:09.701
Came to my house the other night

06:09.703 --> 06:10.969
Telling me to
lay off martin odum.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.070
And it wasn't a very
friendly visit either,

06:12.072 --> 06:13.372
If you know what I mean.

06:13.374 --> 06:15.407
Now, I don't know
what all this adds up to,

06:15.409 --> 06:17.776
But dco is acting like
they got something to hide.

06:35.528 --> 06:38.630
Thought I'd keep you company
before the exchange.

06:40.700 --> 06:42.934
Does the colonel know
you're here?

06:42.936 --> 06:46.772
Who do you think asked me
to keep an eye on you?

06:47.707 --> 06:50.041
All part of the job, huh?

06:50.043 --> 06:52.344
It's the best part.

06:59.952 --> 07:03.288
You know
city hall park?

07:03.290 --> 07:06.024
Lovely place to
feed the pigeons.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.025
(chuckles)

07:07.027 --> 07:09.227
Yeah, I know it.

07:09.229 --> 07:12.097
We have to meet yuri there
tomorrow morning at 8:00.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.367
Right.

07:15.369 --> 07:18.103
Dante, I have to leave
when the deal is complete.

07:19.739 --> 07:22.941
I don't suppose we could
see each other again?

07:24.243 --> 07:26.311
Another life maybe.

07:26.313 --> 07:28.480
It's too bad

07:28.482 --> 07:30.482
We don't have more than one.

07:32.418 --> 07:33.752
How'd you meet him?

07:33.754 --> 07:35.654
Yuri.

07:35.656 --> 07:38.990
My parents were killed
in the civil war in chechnya

07:38.992 --> 07:40.492
When I was two.

07:43.062 --> 07:46.832
I was put in an orphanage.

07:46.834 --> 07:49.301
That wasn't easy for you,
I would imagine.

07:55.942 --> 07:58.143
They put us in cages.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.647
There were so many children.

08:05.418 --> 08:07.819
Yuri adopted me when I was ten.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.258
He's like
a father to you?

08:13.260 --> 08:15.827
Yeah?

08:15.829 --> 08:17.762
Or something else?

08:21.501 --> 08:24.970
He would never
take advantage of me that way.

08:24.972 --> 08:27.038
No offense.

08:30.943 --> 08:33.545
Just wanted to know
where I stood.

08:35.448 --> 08:37.549
(shower running)

08:52.965 --> 08:55.133
You care to join?

08:55.135 --> 08:56.501
(sighs)

08:56.503 --> 08:58.503
You kind of like me, don't you?

08:58.505 --> 09:01.239
Mm... Not at all.

09:23.896 --> 09:26.031
Martin:
Beautiful day.

09:26.033 --> 09:28.033
Yuri: How do you know
they're beautiful

09:28.035 --> 09:30.335
When they're
all the same?

09:32.204 --> 09:34.506
I'm from liverpool, mate.

09:34.508 --> 09:36.374
Take all the sun I can get.

09:36.376 --> 09:38.276
(men chuckle)

09:44.116 --> 09:47.919
Everything is packaged
separately and securely.

09:53.960 --> 09:55.760
All looks in order.

09:57.463 --> 10:00.265
Wiring through now.

10:01.634 --> 10:02.867
Done.

10:02.869 --> 10:05.203
We need a minute
for the verification.

10:07.139 --> 10:08.907
Intercepting the wire now, sir.

10:08.909 --> 10:11.876
Rerouting for cover
and ghost fund.

10:11.878 --> 10:14.412
I remember when it was
flash cash in a briefcase.

10:14.414 --> 10:16.147
Gates: The transaction's
secretly marked

10:16.149 --> 10:17.716
With a digital code.

10:17.718 --> 10:20.218
Once we make the arrest,
the $32 million we transferred

10:20.220 --> 10:22.153
Will disappear
from their account.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.388
Impressive.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.657
Smoke and mirrors--
that's what I do.

10:26.726 --> 10:28.426
(phone chimes)

10:28.428 --> 10:30.161
We're good.
Good.

10:38.604 --> 10:40.171
Pleasure doing business
with you.

10:41.440 --> 10:43.608
Fbi!
Hands in the air now!

10:43.610 --> 10:44.776
(sirens wailing,
tires screeching)

10:44.778 --> 10:47.078
Let's go!
Nice and steady! Fbi!

10:47.080 --> 10:49.247
Turn around.

10:49.249 --> 10:51.349
Turn around. I need
your hands in the air.

10:52.752 --> 10:54.919
Don't move.
Keep your hands up.

10:54.921 --> 10:56.921
(gunfire)

10:56.923 --> 10:58.657
(people screaming)

11:00.092 --> 11:01.159
Martin:
Ana, come on!

11:05.331 --> 11:06.631
Ana!

11:06.633 --> 11:07.832
You shot?
You okay?

11:11.937 --> 11:13.438
(tires screeching)

11:13.440 --> 11:15.640
Crystal: I'm pinned down.
(gunfire continues)

11:15.642 --> 11:17.008
Trying to get eyes
on the shooter.

11:17.010 --> 11:20.011
How in the hell did we miss
the sniper in the sweep?

11:20.013 --> 11:21.146
(gunfire continues)

11:21.148 --> 11:23.048
Confirm gunman
on the roof.

11:23.050 --> 11:24.849
Northwest corner of the park.
Gray building.

11:24.851 --> 11:27.452
Gates: Copy that.
We've got eyes on him.

11:27.454 --> 11:28.386
(gunshot)

11:28.388 --> 11:30.121
Agent:
Sniper down.

11:30.123 --> 11:31.823
Stop right there!

11:31.825 --> 11:34.025
Stop or I will shoot!

11:38.330 --> 11:40.198
Hands on your head.

11:41.400 --> 11:42.901
We can't go back to your place,

11:42.903 --> 11:44.335
We can't go to the hotel.

11:44.337 --> 11:45.503
Where are we going?

11:45.505 --> 11:47.772
We're not going home.

11:49.875 --> 11:52.911
You're under arrest.

11:54.914 --> 11:56.981
It's over, ana.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.595
All right.
Here we are.

12:10.597 --> 12:11.663
Mccombs, robert j.

12:11.665 --> 12:12.997
Rice: Right here?
Yeah.

12:12.999 --> 12:15.166
Should be all of
his pocket litter,

12:15.168 --> 12:17.702
Clothes, everything
he had on him.

12:17.704 --> 12:19.404
The surveillance camera
on that platform

12:19.406 --> 12:21.005
Were disabled during
the murder, right?

12:21.007 --> 12:22.774
Nothing but static.

12:22.776 --> 12:24.075
What does that tell you?

12:24.077 --> 12:25.944
I don't know,
budget cuts?
Nah.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.412
Cameras were fine;
I checked them myself.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.013
Now, either the
system was hacked,

12:29.015 --> 12:31.116
Or they used some type of
high-frequency emitter

12:31.118 --> 12:33.017
To disrupt the signal.

12:33.019 --> 12:34.786
That's spy craft, man.

12:34.788 --> 12:36.921
Yeah, sounds intriguing.

12:40.259 --> 12:43.194
"bixby's diner."

12:43.196 --> 12:45.296
Is that the one
that's on alameda?
Yeah, alameda and 8th.

12:45.298 --> 12:47.132
Um, lot of bums
hang out down there.

12:47.134 --> 12:49.701
Bunch of them camp in the
parking lot around the corner.

12:55.407 --> 12:57.375
Have you seen this guy?

12:57.377 --> 12:59.577
That's kenny's friend.

12:59.579 --> 13:01.513
Kenny. Where can
I find kenny?

13:09.155 --> 13:10.555
Hey.

13:11.724 --> 13:12.957
Kenny.

13:15.327 --> 13:17.395
Come on.
Stay the hell
away from me!

13:17.397 --> 13:18.496
Whoa, all right,
back up, hold on!

13:18.498 --> 13:19.497
All right?

13:19.499 --> 13:21.032
I'm fbi.
Stay back!

13:24.170 --> 13:26.571
Ah, my elbow!
I can't breathe!
Relax, relax.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.506
I'm not gonna hurt you.

13:28.508 --> 13:30.642
So I have a couple
questions to ask you, okay?

13:30.644 --> 13:32.744
Have you seen him?

13:34.613 --> 13:36.815
Yeah. On the subway platform.

13:36.817 --> 13:38.149
What was he
doing there?

13:38.151 --> 13:39.617
Mccombs was
waiting for him.

13:39.619 --> 13:41.419
Rice: <i>And you were there?</i>
<i>You saw mccombs?</i>

13:41.421 --> 13:43.154
I was the lookout,

13:43.156 --> 13:45.023
But I didn't see
her coming, you know?

13:45.025 --> 13:46.691
She came right
out of the crowd.

13:47.626 --> 13:49.093
What do you
mean "she"?

13:49.095 --> 13:51.129
No. This guy
stabbed mccombs.

13:51.131 --> 13:53.097
Not him.
It was a woman.

13:53.099 --> 13:56.100
<i>Looked like she punched him</i>
<i>in the stomach.</i>

13:56.102 --> 13:57.502
But then
I saw the blood.

13:57.504 --> 13:58.870
Then he ran up.

13:58.872 --> 14:00.939
Rice:
<i>So a woman stabbed mccombs.</i>

14:00.941 --> 14:01.940
Who was she?

14:01.942 --> 14:03.274
I don't know.
Did she know him?

14:03.276 --> 14:04.375
I don't know!

14:04.377 --> 14:05.877
And she killed him.

14:05.879 --> 14:07.612
Just like he said
might happen.

14:13.953 --> 14:16.321
Gates: The canisters martin
procured during the sting

14:16.323 --> 14:18.456
Contain a mixture
of dimethyl ether

14:18.458 --> 14:19.958
And polyvinyl acetate.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.192
Hairspray.

14:23.662 --> 14:25.230
So where's the real vx?

14:25.232 --> 14:27.232
We didn't find it at the lab
where hubbard made it,

14:27.234 --> 14:29.968
But he says that he made
five liters of the chemical.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.202
They definitely have it.

14:32.571 --> 14:34.873
I saw it demonstrated.

14:36.342 --> 14:37.308
When?

14:37.310 --> 14:39.711
When I was dark.

14:39.713 --> 14:41.312
Well, how'd they do it?

14:52.191 --> 14:54.058
He foamed at the mouth and nose

14:54.060 --> 14:56.261
And died
seconds later.

14:57.930 --> 15:00.665
Bottom line, we need
to find the nerve agent.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.333
And neither of our
suspects will talk.

15:02.335 --> 15:04.936
Martin: Yuri still thinks
I'm dante auerbach.

15:04.938 --> 15:06.704
We could use that
to our advantage.

15:06.706 --> 15:08.873
Uh, we can get medved
and paulanos on intent.

15:08.875 --> 15:10.842
Spiller: I don't want them
talking to a lawyer

15:10.844 --> 15:12.176
Until we recover the vx.

15:12.178 --> 15:14.913
We can categorize them
as "enemy combatants."

15:14.915 --> 15:16.514
May get a
little tricky,

15:16.516 --> 15:18.383
Since we didn't get the
weapon, but if martin...

15:18.385 --> 15:21.019
Yeah, I'll sign an affidavit.

15:21.021 --> 15:22.754
Whatever it takes.

15:27.359 --> 15:29.494
(door buzzes, opens)

15:33.866 --> 15:37.068
We recovered the container
you were trying to sell.

15:37.070 --> 15:39.537
Where are the five liters of vx?

15:44.810 --> 15:46.811
I'm gonna lay out
the options for you.

15:46.813 --> 15:49.447
Cooperate, or you're going
to a black site.

15:49.449 --> 15:53.451
What goes into a black site
doesn't come out.

15:53.453 --> 15:57.622
You know where I come from,
what we do to women like you?

15:58.757 --> 16:01.559
Rape? Murder?

16:01.561 --> 16:03.895
Just like you did
to ana's mother.

16:03.897 --> 16:05.596
That's right.

16:05.598 --> 16:08.366
We did our
homework on you.

16:11.770 --> 16:14.739
Sometimes things happen in war.

16:17.443 --> 16:19.644
Where is she?
Just down
the hall.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.512
You know, only one
of you gets a deal.

16:21.514 --> 16:24.015
I hope she's not upset
about something.

16:25.751 --> 16:26.651
Hey.

16:28.487 --> 16:32.290
I want a gulf iv jet, fully
fueled, with norad clearance

16:32.292 --> 16:34.025
Outside u.S. Airspace

16:34.027 --> 16:37.428
Through to sevastopol.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.063
Ana comes with me.

16:40.766 --> 16:43.034
We don't negotiate
with terrorists.

16:46.138 --> 16:47.972
Either you do this,

16:47.974 --> 16:51.476
Or there will be
a vx nerve gas attack

16:51.478 --> 16:53.378
In los angeles within the hour.

16:54.980 --> 16:57.682
There'll be another attack,
and then another attack,

16:57.684 --> 16:59.884
Until I'm set free.

16:59.886 --> 17:01.853
Alert first responders.

17:01.855 --> 17:03.621
Get jttf
on the line.

17:03.623 --> 17:05.556
I need to call the director.

17:12.331 --> 17:14.632
(bus engine rumbling)

17:19.138 --> 17:21.005
Hey!

17:21.007 --> 17:22.206
Hey, you forgot your bag!

17:27.813 --> 17:30.848
A man left this.
He just got off the bus.

17:30.850 --> 17:31.916
Yeah, just a minute.
Leave it there

17:31.918 --> 17:33.251
And I'll drop it off
at the terminal.

17:35.854 --> 17:37.455
(gas hissing, people gasping)

17:40.826 --> 17:42.093
(coughing)

17:42.095 --> 17:43.761
(horns blaring)

17:45.197 --> 17:46.297
(coughing)

17:54.840 --> 17:57.008
Sir, there's been an attack,
on a city bus.

17:57.010 --> 17:58.810
They're saying
it's a chemical attack.

18:03.682 --> 18:06.617
Crystal: 16 victims,
including the driver.

18:06.619 --> 18:09.754
The dispersal device was
an improvised aerosolizer.

18:09.756 --> 18:12.090
They were probably
dead within minutes.

18:12.092 --> 18:14.725
Gates: They couldn't get
off the bus fast enough.

18:14.727 --> 18:15.626
The colonel's
promised more attacks

18:15.628 --> 18:17.228
If we don't meet
his demands.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.297
And paulanos refuses
to cooperate.

18:19.299 --> 18:21.265
We need to make a decision now.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.101
I say that we get

18:23.103 --> 18:24.569
The colonel off american soil,

18:24.571 --> 18:27.605
Give him the screws,
and make him call it off.

18:29.808 --> 18:32.110
And if that
doesn't work?

18:32.112 --> 18:33.811
We're running
out of time.

18:33.813 --> 18:37.148
This can't happen again.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.090
Either you do this,

18:46.092 --> 18:48.493
Or there'll be
a vx nerve gas attack

18:48.495 --> 18:50.495
In los angeles within the hour.

18:50.497 --> 18:53.397
If I'm not released,

18:53.399 --> 18:54.665
There'll be another attack,

18:54.667 --> 18:56.234
And then another attack
and another attack,

18:56.236 --> 18:57.735
Until I'm set free.

18:57.737 --> 19:00.171
I am briefing the president
in ten minutes.

19:00.173 --> 19:03.174
I need to tell him we have
a plan to stop this thing.

19:03.176 --> 19:05.243
Agent odom's proposed
a covert sting,

19:05.245 --> 19:07.311
Keeping his legend in play
with the colonel.

19:07.313 --> 19:10.148
We believe it's the only
way to secure the wmd.

19:10.150 --> 19:12.083
Gates: Our operative's
legend was burned

19:12.085 --> 19:13.684
With one suspect
during the arrest,

19:13.686 --> 19:15.520
But not with the colonel.
Our proposal...

19:15.522 --> 19:17.989
Is to let a known terrorist
escape. Do you think I'm crazy?

19:17.991 --> 19:20.158
Well, technically,
he would be in the custody

19:20.160 --> 19:22.160
Of agent odom,
albeit undercover.

19:22.162 --> 19:25.196
It's entirely
outside of protocol.

19:25.198 --> 19:27.932
Extremely dangerous,
no matter who the operative is.

19:27.934 --> 19:29.433
There's no precedent.

19:29.435 --> 19:31.202
Well, there's no precedent
for the spot we're in here.

19:31.204 --> 19:33.204
Unless we do something,
there are going to be

19:33.206 --> 19:34.639
More vx attacks.

19:34.641 --> 19:36.607
Why spring the colonel's
daughter as well?

19:37.509 --> 19:39.277
Special agent martin odom, sir.

19:39.279 --> 19:42.513
I believe her presence is
necessary to sell the ploy.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.115
What if she blows your cover?

19:44.117 --> 19:46.851
I think we can get her to turn.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.152
So we take her at her word?

19:48.154 --> 19:49.987
Well, I'm the one
betting my life on it, sir,

19:49.989 --> 19:52.123
So, uh, yes.

19:56.128 --> 19:57.862
(door closes)

19:59.031 --> 20:00.865
(martin sniffs)

20:02.734 --> 20:04.669
You want to know my real name?

20:04.671 --> 20:06.404
I don't care.

20:06.406 --> 20:07.672
Stop acting wounded.

20:07.674 --> 20:10.074
16 people are dead
from a vx attack.

20:10.076 --> 20:12.577
The colonel is trying to
extort his way to freedom.

20:12.579 --> 20:14.912
That's not
going to happen.

20:14.914 --> 20:17.014
I want a lawyer.

20:17.016 --> 20:19.483
No lawyers for
enemy combatants.

20:19.485 --> 20:21.686
I didn't think that I
could be played, dante,

20:21.688 --> 20:23.321
But you played me.

20:23.323 --> 20:26.657
With your stories
about your wife

20:26.659 --> 20:29.560
And how your relationship
withered because of work.

20:29.562 --> 20:32.763
(laughs)

20:32.765 --> 20:34.865
Tell me, are you
married, dante?

20:34.867 --> 20:36.167
The real you?

20:38.503 --> 20:41.739
You are married.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.874
And she left you.

20:43.876 --> 20:47.278
Because of work, right?

20:47.280 --> 20:49.580
Tell lies close
to the truth--

20:49.582 --> 20:51.649
Isn't that the trick?

20:52.951 --> 20:56.220
Does she know that
you slept with me?

20:56.222 --> 20:58.589
Whatever it takes
to stop people like you.

20:58.591 --> 20:59.857
She understands that.

20:59.859 --> 21:02.026
Oh, she understands,

21:02.028 --> 21:03.928
But she doesn't know.

21:05.697 --> 21:07.965
Neither do you.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.634
About your own father.

21:09.636 --> 21:13.437
My father was killed in
grozny when I was a baby.

21:13.439 --> 21:15.606
No, I don't mean
your real father.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.608
I mean yuri medved.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.844
You know, the colonel.

21:21.647 --> 21:23.547
How come he plucked
your dirty little face

21:23.549 --> 21:25.116
From dozens at the orphanage?

21:25.118 --> 21:26.817
Hmm? Was it love?

21:26.819 --> 21:28.419
Pity?

21:28.421 --> 21:31.055
Or was it guilt?

21:31.057 --> 21:33.891
Guilt for what he'd done to you,
to your life.

21:33.893 --> 21:35.960
I don't know what
you're talking about.

21:35.962 --> 21:38.062
Remember how your mother died?

21:39.498 --> 21:41.499
Raped and strangled
by a soldier

21:41.501 --> 21:43.601
Who accused her
of being a sniper.

21:43.603 --> 21:45.069
You know who it was.

21:45.071 --> 21:46.637
Stop talking to me.

21:46.639 --> 21:50.408
He just wanted some time alone
with her, I suppose.

21:50.410 --> 21:53.177
Spoils of war
and all that.

21:53.179 --> 21:55.413
She fought back,

21:55.415 --> 21:57.415
And he strangled her
in her own bed.

22:00.018 --> 22:01.419
You're lying.

22:01.421 --> 22:03.788
That's why he came for you.

22:03.790 --> 22:05.156
Guilt.

22:07.426 --> 22:10.728
Ana, I need your help.

22:18.203 --> 22:21.405
Don't let the colonel
take you down with him, ana.

22:36.154 --> 22:39.557
Where I come from,

22:39.559 --> 22:42.393
You know what we do
to women like you?

22:42.395 --> 22:44.895
Crystal:
Rape?

22:44.897 --> 22:46.397
Murder?

22:46.399 --> 22:50.034
Just like you did
to ana's mother.

22:50.036 --> 22:51.736
That's right.

22:51.738 --> 22:53.304
We did our
homework on you.

22:53.306 --> 22:55.606
Things happen during war.

22:57.342 --> 22:59.343
Crystal:
So here's the deal.

22:59.345 --> 23:01.078
Assist in
recovering the vx,

23:01.080 --> 23:04.749
And we'll promise to limit
your time to five years.

23:08.353 --> 23:10.821
You want me to sit in a cage...

23:12.724 --> 23:14.925
...For five years?

23:14.927 --> 23:17.194
Ana...

23:17.196 --> 23:19.764
This is the best
it's going to get.

23:24.569 --> 23:25.836
Congratulations, colonel.

23:25.838 --> 23:27.505
You punched your ticket
out of here.

23:27.507 --> 23:29.673
A jet is fueled and waiting
to fly you to havana.

23:29.675 --> 23:31.575
The russian consulate
has been notified.

23:31.577 --> 23:34.712
As soon as I'm on cuban soil,
I'll call off the attacks.

23:34.714 --> 23:37.415
The United States will
never stop seeking justice

23:37.417 --> 23:39.950
On behalf of
your victims.

23:39.952 --> 23:42.353
And I hope that
you burn in hell.

23:59.905 --> 24:02.006
â™ª

24:20.091 --> 24:21.459
What the hell was that?!

24:21.461 --> 24:23.227
(tires screeching)

24:25.163 --> 24:26.497
Back it up!

24:26.499 --> 24:27.665
Agent (over radio):
We're taking fire!

24:27.667 --> 24:29.733
Crystal:
We're under attack!

24:29.735 --> 24:30.968
Agent:
Seems like an ied.

24:32.003 --> 24:34.371
No, forward! Go!

24:36.074 --> 24:39.343
Send major backup
to the gps coordinates!

24:39.345 --> 24:41.178
Agent 2:
Hostile vehicle.

24:42.013 --> 24:43.747
Agent:
Lost the engine!

24:43.749 --> 24:45.850
Stay with the prisoner.

24:45.852 --> 24:47.518
(automatic gunfire)

24:51.957 --> 24:53.257
Agent:
Get out and flank.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.194
Agent 2: We're not gonna get
out of here in the vehicles.

25:03.468 --> 25:05.369
Agent:
Sniper, two o'clock.

25:11.376 --> 25:12.376
(grunts)

25:13.378 --> 25:14.612
Prisoner convoy,
support is on its way.

25:14.614 --> 25:15.946
The eta: Two minutes.

25:15.948 --> 25:18.449
Prisoner convoy,
support on its way.

25:18.451 --> 25:19.717
Eta: Two minutes.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.220
Come on.

25:25.056 --> 25:27.124
Prisoner convoy,
are you still there?

25:27.126 --> 25:28.325
Mcguire, do you read?

25:28.327 --> 25:29.960
Do you read?! Mcguire!

25:47.012 --> 25:49.847
You picked the wrong man
to rip off, colonel.

25:49.849 --> 25:52.616
You and I have
unfinished business.

26:06.698 --> 26:08.399
Agent:
Bird is away.

26:08.401 --> 26:09.767
We're all clear.

26:12.904 --> 26:15.072
This is mcguire. We're in play.

26:15.074 --> 26:17.107
Gates (over radio):
Good work, crystal.

26:17.109 --> 26:18.776
Let's hope dante comes through.

26:33.291 --> 26:35.426
â™ª

26:46.972 --> 26:48.639
Keep your head down.

26:48.641 --> 26:49.807
Clear!

27:04.222 --> 27:06.323
Sit down.

27:11.262 --> 27:13.130
(laughing)

27:18.670 --> 27:19.870
(groans)

27:23.908 --> 27:24.942
(gasps)

27:24.944 --> 27:26.076
(groans)

27:34.252 --> 27:35.519
Ouch.

27:35.521 --> 27:37.121
You still got your teeth.

27:37.123 --> 27:38.455
(laughs)

27:38.457 --> 27:40.257
(chuckles)

27:40.259 --> 27:42.693
You don't know me very well,
do you, colonel?

27:42.695 --> 27:44.795
If you did, you would

27:44.797 --> 27:46.997
Never have tried to rip me off.

27:46.999 --> 27:50.501
You went to all this trouble
to spring me out...

27:50.503 --> 27:53.504
Just to put a bullet in my head?

27:53.506 --> 27:55.339
I don't think so.

27:55.341 --> 27:58.008
My clients want
their money back.

27:58.010 --> 28:01.612
You know as well as I do the fbi
has frozen all my assets.

28:01.614 --> 28:02.479
(clicks tongue)

28:02.481 --> 28:03.981
Then I want the merchandise.

28:03.983 --> 28:07.184
Only if you arrange
exfiltration for ana

28:07.186 --> 28:08.952
And I.

28:08.954 --> 28:10.954
This isn't
a negotiation, colonel.

28:12.023 --> 28:15.192
Negotiation is over.

28:15.194 --> 28:18.062
And you'll call off any
other planned attacks.

28:18.064 --> 28:19.863
What do you care
about the attacks?

28:19.865 --> 28:22.132
I'm sure your buyers
would like to see

28:22.134 --> 28:24.535
How effective our product is.

28:24.537 --> 28:26.236
Well, your little
demonstration with the bus

28:26.238 --> 28:28.072
Was enough for them.

28:28.074 --> 28:31.141
Anything else would be stupid
and only draw more attention.

28:32.077 --> 28:34.111
Naturally.

28:35.714 --> 28:38.716
Here's your phone.
Call your guy.

28:39.884 --> 28:41.952
(line ringing)

28:44.723 --> 28:46.790
Yeah. Stand down.

28:52.063 --> 28:53.997
Friends again?

28:56.935 --> 28:58.736
(screams)

29:03.208 --> 29:04.708
I didn't want this to happen.

29:04.710 --> 29:06.076
I wanted to make a deal.

29:06.078 --> 29:08.178
Oh! (screams)

29:08.180 --> 29:09.947
But we both know,

29:09.949 --> 29:12.416
For business to get done,
for deals to get done,

29:12.418 --> 29:14.618
Both sides have to act
in good faith.

29:14.620 --> 29:16.720
You did not do that. So...

29:16.722 --> 29:18.355
(groaning)

29:18.357 --> 29:19.523
I'm gonna use

29:19.525 --> 29:22.526
Every available recourse
to protect...

29:22.528 --> 29:24.695
(screams)

29:24.697 --> 29:25.863
...My assets.

29:26.865 --> 29:28.298
(sobbing)

29:30.702 --> 29:32.302
Son of a bitch.

29:33.605 --> 29:36.273
You can, and will,
arrange a pickup tomorrow.

29:36.275 --> 29:37.708
(panting)

29:37.710 --> 29:39.376
How long you live

29:39.378 --> 29:42.045
Depends on doing
exactly as I say.

29:55.293 --> 29:58.061
Thought that you hated vodka.

29:59.998 --> 30:03.066
I guess you don't know me
as well as you thought.

30:03.068 --> 30:04.735
Well, you got him
to call off the attack.

30:04.737 --> 30:07.004
We traced his call.

30:07.006 --> 30:08.806
Picked up one of his soldiers.

30:08.808 --> 30:11.175
They found a small amount
of vx in his possession.

30:11.177 --> 30:14.478
We still need to
secure the rest.

30:14.480 --> 30:17.981
I know it's not easy
to do what you're doing.

30:20.318 --> 30:22.019
But you're doing a great job.

30:22.021 --> 30:25.189
(laughs)

30:25.191 --> 30:26.990
Don't patronize me.

30:29.327 --> 30:30.994
I'm trying to support you.

30:30.996 --> 30:32.663
You're trying to manage me.

30:32.665 --> 30:35.032
You're trying to
manage your asset.

30:35.034 --> 30:37.768
(laughs)

30:37.770 --> 30:40.871
Great job, huh?

30:40.873 --> 30:43.674
People died today
because I misread the target.

30:45.543 --> 30:48.245
Nothing is in hand, crystal.

30:51.282 --> 30:53.116
At least not yet.

31:09.567 --> 31:12.135
He's gonna kill us either way.

31:14.839 --> 31:16.640
Ana.

31:18.309 --> 31:19.977
Do you hear me?

31:25.250 --> 31:27.284
Of all the children
at the orphanage...

31:30.088 --> 31:32.256
...Why did you choose
to save me?

31:32.258 --> 31:35.325
Why are you asking that?

31:35.327 --> 31:36.994
I want to know.

31:38.162 --> 31:39.763
It's hard to explain.

31:39.765 --> 31:42.933
When I first saw you,

31:42.935 --> 31:46.336
You looked at me and smiled.

31:46.338 --> 31:49.773
You had an...

31:49.775 --> 31:51.909
Innocence...

31:54.279 --> 31:56.847
...That drew me to you.

31:56.849 --> 31:58.448
It wasn't because of my mother?

31:58.450 --> 32:02.419
I never... Knew your mother.

32:07.792 --> 32:09.927
She was raped.

32:12.797 --> 32:15.365
She was strangled.

32:15.367 --> 32:18.635
By a soldier.

32:18.637 --> 32:21.138
They told me his name.

32:21.140 --> 32:23.440
The fbi.

32:27.145 --> 32:28.879
They said it was you.

32:28.881 --> 32:31.481
They're just saying this
to turn you against me.
Stop.

32:31.483 --> 32:33.216
It's what they do.
Stop.

32:33.218 --> 32:34.718
Stop lying to me.

32:34.720 --> 32:36.787
(sighs)

32:42.627 --> 32:44.928
Please.

32:44.930 --> 32:47.064
Listen to me. I want to explain.

32:51.502 --> 32:53.971
How could you?

32:57.742 --> 33:00.844
To the men I was with,
it was expected--

33:00.846 --> 33:02.646
A rite of passage.

33:05.984 --> 33:08.485
After I, uh...

33:12.490 --> 33:14.257
...I looked down
at your mother...

33:16.427 --> 33:18.895
...And something inside me...

33:22.700 --> 33:25.168
...Broke.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.439
I needed to...

33:29.441 --> 33:31.475
To erase
what I had just done.

33:31.477 --> 33:35.379
I needed to hide the proof
of my sin.

33:35.381 --> 33:37.914
But it just made it worse.

33:40.284 --> 33:43.887
I was overcome
by guilt.

33:43.889 --> 33:46.957
That's why I came to get you

33:46.959 --> 33:50.060
From the
orphanage, ana.

33:50.062 --> 33:52.596
I wanted
to give back the love...

33:54.966 --> 33:57.768
...That I took.

33:59.837 --> 34:03.273
What can I do
to make you believe that?

34:17.255 --> 34:18.822
(sighs)

34:18.824 --> 34:20.590
Get me out of here.

34:20.592 --> 34:23.060
(crying):
I'm trying!

34:27.665 --> 34:30.133
Give dante what he wants.

34:31.269 --> 34:33.603
Give him the vx.

34:33.605 --> 34:36.339
Beg for mercy.

34:41.512 --> 34:45.082
I'll take him
to the vault.

34:45.084 --> 34:47.451
She got to him.

34:47.453 --> 34:49.986
It worked.

34:51.956 --> 34:54.424
Let's finish it.

35:02.934 --> 35:05.368
So, we get the key
from the guard here?

35:05.370 --> 35:07.737
Oh, it's not a bank.
It's a private vault.

35:07.739 --> 35:09.272
It's got biometric

35:09.274 --> 35:11.141
Security; I
have to go in.

35:11.143 --> 35:13.176
Well, you're not going in alone.

35:18.149 --> 35:20.951
Let's all go
for a walk.

35:32.263 --> 35:34.764
Drone's in position.

35:34.766 --> 35:36.833
We're locking down
the perimeter.

35:36.835 --> 35:39.169
(computer beeping)
we got him.

35:39.171 --> 35:41.371
It's not over yet.

35:45.510 --> 35:47.144
Sit down.

35:47.146 --> 35:49.079
Hey.

35:49.081 --> 35:51.748
I'd like access
to my safety-deposit box.

35:51.750 --> 35:53.850
Please.

35:56.654 --> 35:58.755
(trilling)

36:03.427 --> 36:04.828
(keys jingling)

36:16.374 --> 36:18.341
I'll give you gentlemen
some privacy.

36:23.514 --> 36:26.016
Stop.

36:26.018 --> 36:29.819
It's not that I don't
trust you, but...

36:29.821 --> 36:31.521
I don't trust you.

36:33.391 --> 36:34.958
Move.

36:46.571 --> 36:48.838
(people screaming)

36:48.840 --> 36:50.240
Shots fired!
Shots fired!

36:50.242 --> 36:53.043
All teams move in. Now!

36:53.045 --> 36:54.477
(groaning)

37:02.587 --> 37:04.754
(sirens wailing)
gates: Hold back.

37:04.756 --> 37:07.123
We got innocent people inside.
Lock down the perimeter.

37:08.759 --> 37:10.460
Get down.

37:18.502 --> 37:19.836
(gunfire)

37:28.179 --> 37:29.246
Let's go!

37:35.453 --> 37:37.120
Martin:
You're out of options.

37:37.122 --> 37:39.689
It's over, yuri.

37:41.626 --> 37:44.194
Put the gun down.

37:44.196 --> 37:46.263
You're fbi.

37:47.798 --> 37:51.101
Martin:
You're not going out of here.

37:51.103 --> 37:53.103
Not alive.

37:53.105 --> 37:55.705
Seems we're at an impasse.

37:55.707 --> 37:59.709
Put the gun down
and kick it over to me.

38:04.215 --> 38:07.217
You take another step,
I'll put a hole through you.

38:22.166 --> 38:23.199
(sirens whoop)

38:26.904 --> 38:28.738
Well done, my dear.

38:34.745 --> 38:36.513
What are you doing?

38:36.515 --> 38:39.015
My whole life has been a lie.

38:41.452 --> 38:45.155
Ana... Lower the gun.

38:45.157 --> 38:47.223
What we have is not a lie.

38:48.693 --> 38:50.460
I love you
like you are my own daughter.

38:50.462 --> 38:52.062
(voice breaking):
I'm not your daughter.

38:54.665 --> 38:57.767
I was an orphan because of you.

38:59.837 --> 39:02.205
Because you killed my mother.

39:02.207 --> 39:04.441
Something I'll regret
the rest of my life.

39:15.052 --> 39:17.754
Lower the gun, ana.

39:20.958 --> 39:22.092
Look at me.

39:25.696 --> 39:28.231
Everything's going to be okay.

39:28.233 --> 39:30.433
Nothing's ever
going to be okay.

39:33.003 --> 39:34.971
I can't go back in a cage.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.975
I will never go back.

39:43.514 --> 39:45.382
Ana.

39:45.384 --> 39:46.549
Ana!
