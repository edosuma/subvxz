00:06.048 --> 00:10.684
a machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:10.686 --> 00:13.019
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

00:13.021 --> 00:14.921
but it sees everything...

00:14.923 --> 00:18.291
Violent crimes
involving ordinary people.

00:18.293 --> 00:21.261
The government considers
these people irrelevant.

00:21.263 --> 00:23.296
We don't.

00:23.298 --> 00:27.934
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

02:17.608 --> 02:19.875
Sometimes teens act out

Whatever's on her laptop,
she doesn't want to lose it.

11:23.251 --> 11:26.986
Now, what do you see when you
look at this picture of Claire?

11:26.988 --> 11:29.989
An unstable college student
staring at street art.

11:29.991 --> 11:31.324
I thought as much myself
until I realized

11:31.326 --> 11:33.359
that the graffiti
isn't graffiti at all.

11:33.361 --> 11:36.161
It's a variation
on a Bongard puzzle.

11:36.163 --> 11:40.833
This particular type of puzzle
presents two sets of diagrams.

11:40.835 --> 11:44.069
The diagrams in the first set
share a common feature.

11:44.071 --> 11:48.006
The blocks never overlap
with the curved lines.

11:48.008 --> 11:51.944
Conversely, in the second set,
the blocks do touch the curves,

11:51.946 --> 11:53.845
but there's an additional
common element.

11:53.847 --> 11:56.747
There's a different number
of blocks in each diagram.

11:56.749 --> 11:58.350
<i>Code cracking.</i>

11:58.352 --> 12:00.751
Sometimes you forget
I was an international spy.

12:00.753 --> 12:02.287
Fair enough.

12:02.289 --> 12:06.224
Now, using this pattern,
I can fill in the blank space

12:06.226 --> 12:09.694
with the only number of blocks
left out, which is three,

12:09.696 --> 12:11.261
thus solving the puzzle,

12:11.263 --> 12:15.265
creating a sort of
three-pronged arch.

12:15.267 --> 12:16.266
May I?

12:20.873 --> 12:23.240
<i>There's your</i>
<i>three-pronged arch, Harold.</i>

12:23.242 --> 12:25.242

12:25.244 --> 12:26.943
If you want to talk to Claire
about this game

12:26.945 --> 12:29.246
she thinks she's playing,
you'll find her there,

12:29.248 --> 12:31.415

12:31.417 --> 12:34.084

- No, I'm more useful here.

half as smart as she seems,

difficult to crack.

12:40.626 --> 12:42.225

working this number.

12:42.227 --> 12:43.292

13:13.991 --> 13:15.323

13:15.325 --> 13:16.792
It's quite a lot of

they found you.

14:00.036 --> 14:02.503

military contractor

15:00.428 --> 15:03.863
I'm sending notes from Claire's
backup drive to your phone.

15:03.865 --> 15:07.367
The game started with a post
