WEBVTT

00:07.595 --> 00:10.712
No, I've never had a serious boyfriend.

00:11.018 --> 00:13.054
No one's really been interested.

00:13.313 --> 00:16.111
Men can be such pigs.

00:16.402 --> 00:18.393
People did try to fix me up.

00:18.655 --> 00:23.365
In Manchester, me mum was steering
me towards the butcher's son.

00:23.747 --> 00:26.898
Pasty little thing, didn't fancy him.

00:27.211 --> 00:30.760
I suppose I like my gents
more on the manly side.

00:34.974 --> 00:37.090
Was that a little swan you made?

00:37.352 --> 00:39.388
No, it was a B-52.

00:43.446 --> 00:47.485
Dr Jennings rang.
Dad skipped his physical again!

00:47.828 --> 00:51.616
No wonder he didn't want me
to go with him.

00:51.960 --> 00:55.032
You know Dad's aversion to doctors.

00:55.341 --> 00:57.377
Why didn't you take him?

00:57.636 --> 01:01.675
I had my "fear of abandonment"
workshop. I've already skipped twice.

01:03.687 --> 01:05.678
Wait till your father gets here.

01:05.942 --> 01:08.456
I'll give him a piece of my mind.

01:13.371 --> 01:17.489
If only we knew
when he was about to arrive.

01:17.837 --> 01:19.748
Hey!

01:21.592 --> 01:25.028
How you doing, boy?
I'm glad to see you, too.

01:25.348 --> 01:28.977
- How was your exam?
- Pretty routine.

01:29.313 --> 01:30.951
- EKG?
- Perfect.

01:31.191 --> 01:33.659
- Blood pressure?
- Textbook.

01:33.946 --> 01:35.425
Full blood panel?

01:35.657 --> 01:38.012
I told them to take two -
they're small.

01:38.328 --> 01:40.717
Oh, let's give a look.

01:42.544 --> 01:44.535
Oh, look at this!

01:44.797 --> 01:48.233
A nice big Band-Aid!
Nice try.

01:50.265 --> 01:52.221
What'd you do that for?

01:52.477 --> 01:57.028
Dr Jennings' office said
you hadn't shown up today.

01:57.401 --> 01:59.961
Why do you avoid the doctor?

02:00.239 --> 02:04.232
Because I feel fine.
And I don't like Dr Jennings.

02:04.580 --> 02:08.573
He's got a model of a colon on his desk.
He keeps his tongue depressors in it.

02:12.468 --> 02:15.426
All right, Dad.
Why don't you see my doctor?

02:15.723 --> 02:21.275
- She's one of the finest in Seattle.
- She? No, no, no way.

02:21.691 --> 02:23.647
If a doctor's
going to have me bend over,

02:23.903 --> 02:26.292
I want to look through
my legs and see wing tips.

02:28.954 --> 02:33.744
Women have been poked and prodded
by male doctors for centuries.

02:34.129 --> 02:38.088
I say it's high time
you gents went to a woman doctor.

02:38.427 --> 02:43.660
See how you like waiting all naked
and helpless and goose-bumpy.

02:44.062 --> 02:45.780
Niles, recommend someone.

02:47.609 --> 02:49.565
Niles!

02:52.534 --> 02:55.606
I'm sorry,
my mind was somewhere else.

02:55.914 --> 02:59.111
Oh, I know who you should see!
Dr Gary Newman!

02:59.421 --> 03:03.539
He's very successful. I saw
a Lichtenstein hanging in his office.

03:03.886 --> 03:06.036
A Lichtenstein? He sounds perfect.

03:06.307 --> 03:09.743
OK. I'll make an appointment.

03:10.062 --> 03:14.180
Just hang on a second.
I will escort you personally.

03:14.528 --> 03:18.760
- Wonderful, I can't wait.
- Stop grumbling. It won't be so bad.

03:19.119 --> 03:21.269
Unless you have to parade
around the office

03:21.540 --> 03:25.658
in one of those gowns
where your bum peaks through.

03:26.006 --> 03:27.962
What's Dr Newman's number?

03:29.011 --> 03:30.239
Niles... Niles!

03:31.891 --> 03:34.644
Sorry, I must have drifted off again.

03:38.026 --> 03:42.816
My appointment was meant to be
half an hour ago. Let's get out of here.

03:43.201 --> 03:46.876
Relax. Read a magazine.
Here, take the Cosmo quiz.

03:50.421 --> 03:53.219
"Are your nipples sensitive?"

03:54.719 --> 03:57.631
Do it quietly.
It's not an oral exam.

03:57.934 --> 04:00.926
You haven't seen the second question.

04:02.315 --> 04:04.465
Did you keep your patients waiting?

04:04.736 --> 04:07.773
Just the compulsives.
It was part of their therapy.

04:08.994 --> 04:11.349
Relax, I'll take care of it.

04:17.507 --> 04:21.101
My father had an appointment
30 minutes ago.

04:21.430 --> 04:24.548
The doctor's running late.
You'll be first when he gets in.

04:24.853 --> 04:27.845
Where's he coming from, Spokane?

04:28.150 --> 04:31.028
From Lake Chelan.

04:31.322 --> 04:34.200
Lake Chelan? Ooh!
This guy must be terrific.

04:35.245 --> 04:38.123
- So?
- He'll be here any minute.

04:42.089 --> 04:45.240
I was just struck by
one of life's little ironies,

04:45.553 --> 04:49.512
I remember you taking me to the doctor
and here I am taking you.

04:49.852 --> 04:53.970
Like when I took you
for your first tetanus shot.

04:54.318 --> 04:57.435
I was scared.
I remember you holding my hand.

04:57.740 --> 05:00.493
You bent over, dropped your drawers.

05:00.787 --> 05:05.224
You took your mind off the shot by
reciting the names of Puccini's operas.

05:07.507 --> 05:10.499
Right then,
I knew you'd never be a cop.

05:12.932 --> 05:14.923
I'm serious, let's go!

05:15.186 --> 05:18.815
I'll check if there's someone
substituting for him.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.373
What are you here for?

05:23.616 --> 05:28.167
Oh, lately, I've been having
this overall sluggish feeling.

05:28.541 --> 05:34.411
It's hard even getting out of bed,
not to mention the cold weather.

05:34.844 --> 05:37.802
It's really making my joints hurt.

05:38.099 --> 05:42.615
I've started to notice
flaking spots on my skin.

05:44.610 --> 05:46.885
What about you?

05:48.073 --> 05:50.587
I have sensitive nipples.

05:55.502 --> 05:59.381
The doctor won't be able
to make your appointment today.

05:59.718 --> 06:03.870
Great! These big shot doctors
keep you waiting for an hour

06:04.225 --> 06:06.580
and then they don't even show up.

06:06.854 --> 06:11.530
Played a little slow on the golf course?
Arrogant JERK!

06:11.905 --> 06:16.421
Dad, Dad, Dad. Dr Newman is dead.
He died an hour ago.

06:19.166 --> 06:22.522
I'm sure he was a good man.

06:25.928 --> 06:29.682
He walks down his walkway,
he picks up his newspaper,

06:30.017 --> 06:33.293
and BANG,
he drops dead of a heart attack.

06:33.607 --> 06:35.757
I pick up my newspaper every day,

06:36.027 --> 06:38.621
and "The Sunday Times" is very heavy.

06:38.907 --> 06:41.296
Well, these things happen.

06:41.578 --> 06:46.447
How can you say that?
He wasn't old! He was my age!

06:46.837 --> 06:51.592
What can I say? I don't think
about these things like you do.

06:51.971 --> 06:55.327
Maybe it's because
you're 41 and I'm not.

06:56.478 --> 06:59.515
Don't you ever think about dying?

06:59.817 --> 07:03.856
Well, not me dying. But you know
what I have thought of lately?

07:04.199 --> 07:09.193
I've been dating this older guy
and what if... You know...

07:10.710 --> 07:13.144
We were in bed and he dropped dead?

07:14.674 --> 07:18.428
It's a possibility.
Sometimes he starts breathing funny.

07:18.765 --> 07:23.202
I don't know if he's having
a good time or if I've overexcited him.

07:25.400 --> 07:28.597
Someone has
a very high opinion of herself.

07:28.907 --> 07:30.863
Everybody's good at something.

07:31.118 --> 07:35.589
Why is it that every time we talk,
we end up talking about your sex life?

07:35.960 --> 07:37.951
Because I have one.

07:43.389 --> 07:45.345
(Footsteps)

07:46.852 --> 07:49.047
Thank you for coming.

07:49.315 --> 07:51.909
- Hello.
- Hello, Dr Crane.

07:52.195 --> 07:57.315
I was in the middle of my workout,
but I can always pump iron later.

07:59.958 --> 08:02.791
I'll just fix us a snack.

08:04.674 --> 08:06.630
"Pump iron" (!)

08:06.885 --> 08:09.638
Niles, you don't even
pump your own gas.

08:11.268 --> 08:13.224
All right.

08:13.480 --> 08:16.392
What's this about getting
your affairs in order?

08:16.694 --> 08:20.448
Dr Newman dying so young
threw me for a loop.

08:20.783 --> 08:25.254
I realised I hadn't made the
proper provisions for my own death.

08:25.624 --> 08:27.933
Here we go.

08:29.715 --> 08:31.671
- Allow me.
- Thanks.

08:35.058 --> 08:37.014
I've prepared copies for you,

08:37.269 --> 08:42.104
the location and numbers of my bank
accounts, my safety deposit keys,

08:42.486 --> 08:46.525
the number for my attorney...
Niles, what are you doing?

08:46.868 --> 08:48.824
Oh, give me that!

08:51.125 --> 08:53.639
I loosened it for him.

08:54.672 --> 08:57.630
Now, my personal possessions.

08:57.928 --> 08:59.998
This is for family only.

09:00.265 --> 09:03.337
Please stay. I'll come to you later.

09:03.646 --> 09:07.116
Dad, Niles, put your names
on these stickers

09:07.444 --> 09:12.040
and place them on the objects
you would like bequeathed to you.

09:13.621 --> 09:16.010
I'm not putting my name on your stuff!

09:16.291 --> 09:21.081
What if I die tomorrow?
You will argue over that African mask.

09:21.467 --> 09:25.506
It'll never happen.
Niles, you can have it.

09:25.850 --> 09:28.318
I don't want it.

09:29.689 --> 09:34.285
Don't look at me. I throw a towel
over it when you're not home.

09:37.201 --> 09:38.953
OK, fine.

09:39.204 --> 09:43.243
Well, now we come
to the issue of...my remains.

09:43.587 --> 09:47.978
- Oh, jeez!
- It's all here in this easy-to-read binder.

09:48.344 --> 09:50.858
This is taking it too far!
Look at this!

09:51.141 --> 09:55.214
Burial... Casket... Caterers?

09:55.565 --> 09:57.635
- Who are you using?
- Michaelson's.

09:57.902 --> 09:59.972
They're very good.

10:01.074 --> 10:03.588
- Bowtie pasta...
- And the asparagus tips...

10:03.870 --> 10:07.704
Excuse me! Excuse me!
Are we done?

10:08.044 --> 10:12.959
There is just one more duck
to put in the row.

10:13.344 --> 10:18.179
I've discovered that most
unexpected deaths occur in the home.

10:18.561 --> 10:22.839
Daphne, this is where you come in,
the actual finding of the body.

10:24.237 --> 10:27.673
Oh, save the best part for me, eh?

10:27.993 --> 10:31.349
That's all right.
As a health-care provider,

10:31.666 --> 10:34.339
I've had my share of patients die on me.

10:34.629 --> 10:37.223
That's a comfort.

10:37.509 --> 10:39.545
Maybe we should drop the subject.

10:39.805 --> 10:44.925
This has made me feel better.
I can handle my mortality better now.

10:45.313 --> 10:47.747
Enough about death!

10:48.026 --> 10:51.735
Let's celebrate life
with this Château Certan '75!

10:52.075 --> 10:56.193
No, not the '75.
That's too good for the likes of us.

10:56.540 --> 11:00.579
Perhaps a Beaujolais Nouveau
would be more appropriate.

11:02.000 --> 11:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:18.786 --> 11:20.822
Eddie?

11:21.080 --> 11:23.514
Oh, there you are. Come on, boy.

11:26.965 --> 11:29.638
Frasier, what are you
still doing up?

11:29.929 --> 11:32.124
Frasier!

11:32.391 --> 11:36.145
Dad, please, shh.
I'm trying to listen to my heartbeat.

11:38.318 --> 11:43.438
It's amazing, it can pump 1,800
gallons of blood each and every day

11:43.827 --> 11:48.947
but just a tiny tear in the tiniest artery,
and poof you're gone.

11:49.336 --> 11:51.691
I thought you were OK about this.

11:51.965 --> 11:55.162
So did I.
What is the matter with me?

11:55.471 --> 11:57.621
I thought that putting my affairs in order

11:57.891 --> 12:00.451
would help me
to deal with this, but it hasn't.

12:00.729 --> 12:06.486
I can't seem to get over the feeling
that something could happen to me.

12:08.159 --> 12:10.753
Jeez, I'd miss so much.

12:11.038 --> 12:14.394
I'd never get to see my son
hit his first home run.

12:14.711 --> 12:18.306
That'd be a terrible thing
for a father to miss.

12:18.634 --> 12:21.148
Tell me about it.

12:24.101 --> 12:26.820
Look, let me tell you something.

12:27.106 --> 12:29.062
There was this time, a while back,

12:29.319 --> 12:32.356
seven or eight of us
were on this drug bust.

12:32.657 --> 12:37.447
We went through the front door
and the first guy took one, he died.

12:37.832 --> 12:42.428
When you're a cop,
you've got to handle things like that,

12:42.798 --> 12:45.551
but I just couldn't get over it.

12:45.845 --> 12:49.884
Every time I had to go
in a dark building, I froze.

12:50.228 --> 12:54.141
I knew if I kept being afraid,
I'd never be able to do my job.

12:54.485 --> 12:59.081
- So what did you do?
- I forced myself to forget it.

12:59.451 --> 13:03.239
Next time I came to one of those doors,
I went right through it!

13:03.583 --> 13:07.576
The fact that I got shot in the hip
was purely coincidental.

13:11.096 --> 13:13.166
You were this close
to helping me.

13:14.810 --> 13:18.439
Just because some doctor dies
doesn't mean you will.

13:18.775 --> 13:22.529
Yeah, but he was just like me,
highly educated, sophisticated.

13:22.866 --> 13:27.064
I saw his picture in a medical journal.
He even looked like me.

13:27.414 --> 13:32.727
Same determined chin, sweater vest,
ever so slightly receding hairline.

13:33.132 --> 13:35.805
You don't know his medical history.

13:36.095 --> 13:40.088
Actually, you're onto
something there, Dad. Yeah...

13:40.436 --> 13:44.475
He could've had high blood pressure,
popped pills, drank like a fish.

13:44.818 --> 13:46.888
Yeah, could be anything.

13:47.155 --> 13:49.225
I'll find out what caused
his heart attack.

13:49.492 --> 13:51.960
Then I can disassociate
myself from him.

13:52.247 --> 13:55.762
There must be some explanation.

13:56.086 --> 13:58.554
That's great, Dad.
I feel better now.

13:58.841 --> 14:01.719
You've got something
on your bathrobe.

14:05.352 --> 14:07.104
"Niles".

14:14.492 --> 14:16.642
The vultures are circling.

14:17.747 --> 14:19.703
Come on, Eddie.

14:27.973 --> 14:29.725
(Tapping at door)

14:30.894 --> 14:32.771
(Hushed) Hello.

14:34.400 --> 14:38.188
I called earlier. Someone said
Mrs Newman would be here.

14:38.532 --> 14:42.366
Please, come in. I'm Allen Freedman.
Gary was my cousin.

14:42.705 --> 14:45.583
Dr Frasier Crane. My condolences.

14:45.876 --> 14:48.595
I didn't know
Mrs Newman had company.

14:48.881 --> 14:51.236
- It's shivah.
- Excuse me?

14:51.511 --> 14:55.265
It's the Jewish version of a wake.

14:55.602 --> 14:57.558
Oh, yes, of course.

14:57.813 --> 15:01.726
- I didn't realise Gary was Jewish.
- You're kidding?

15:02.070 --> 15:07.098
We did spend a lot of time together.
Never on Friday nights, of course.

15:09.291 --> 15:11.247
This is a bad time.

15:11.502 --> 15:15.575
Jill would love to know you came.
She's right over there.

15:15.927 --> 15:21.160
- She looks busy. Well, I can wait.
- Will you excuse me?

15:35.626 --> 15:37.582
May I help you?

15:38.965 --> 15:43.083
Oh, this is a mirror. I thought maybe
you were having an unveiling later.

15:43.430 --> 15:46.945
You're not Jewish, are you?

15:48.897 --> 15:52.207
No, no, my ex-wife is, though,

15:52.529 --> 15:57.922
and thus my son is, which makes me
sort of, well... No, I'm not Jewish.

15:58.330 --> 16:01.800
We always cover mirrors at a shivah

16:02.128 --> 16:06.041
so those grieving don't have to be
concerned with their appearances.

16:06.969 --> 16:09.403
Well, you look very nice.

16:09.682 --> 16:13.152
Oh, thank you.
It's been driving me crazy.

16:15.190 --> 16:20.184
- I'm Bobbie, Gary's aunt.
- Dr Frasier Crane. My sympathies.

16:20.575 --> 16:23.009
The doctor with the radio show?

16:23.288 --> 16:26.485
- Did you know Gary well?
- Oh, well. Yes, I did.

16:26.793 --> 16:30.422
There was so much more
I wanted to know about the man.

16:30.759 --> 16:34.638
I don't know... Eh...
How was his health before he died?

16:34.973 --> 16:38.170
- Excellent, he was never sick.
- Heart disease?

16:38.480 --> 16:43.315
- High blood pressure or cholesterol?
- No.

16:43.696 --> 16:46.449
I'm sorry,
I'm asking too many questions.

16:46.743 --> 16:49.496
We doctors are always looking
for the answers.

16:51.250 --> 16:54.003
- Oh, Gail!
- Aunt Bobbie!

16:54.297 --> 16:55.650
I know, I know.

16:57.844 --> 17:02.360
I'd like you to meet a friend of Gary's,
Dr Frasier Crane.

17:02.727 --> 17:04.922
Dr Crane? From the radio?

17:05.190 --> 17:08.340
Yes. I'm sorry for your loss.

17:08.654 --> 17:11.122
I love your show!

17:11.409 --> 17:17.040
Oh, I'm sorry. When I went to pick up
this Linzer torte, I thought of Gary and...

17:17.460 --> 17:20.691
So Gary liked fattening desserts?

17:21.008 --> 17:26.241
Oh, no. If he knew
I brought this here, he'd kill me.

17:26.642 --> 17:29.679
Gary was a health fanatic.
A vegetarian.

17:29.981 --> 17:31.937
We played basketball every Sunday.

17:32.192 --> 17:34.547
So he was sedentary all week

17:34.822 --> 17:38.292
and then burning up
the court on Sundays?

17:38.620 --> 17:43.057
No, he played four times a week
if he wasn't at the gym working out.

17:43.420 --> 17:48.733
- Gary was in phenomenal shape.
- Didn't smoke, never touched coffee.

17:49.137 --> 17:51.446
He had less than 10% body fat.

17:51.725 --> 17:55.764
My goodness, has anybody
checked to see if he's really dead?

18:01.199 --> 18:05.989
I'm... I'm sure they did check.
Those people are very thorough.

18:06.375 --> 18:10.573
Oh, my, is that Kugel? Excuse me.

18:21.858 --> 18:27.251
Mrs Newman. I'm Dr Frasier Crane.
I was a friend of your husband's.

18:27.660 --> 18:31.050
- Dr Crane! From...
- Yes, the radio.

18:31.374 --> 18:35.765
- Gary never mentioned you.
- Well, we weren't actually friends.

18:36.132 --> 18:38.805
He had an office
in my brother's building.

18:39.095 --> 18:41.484
You took the time to come here!

18:41.766 --> 18:45.475
His own partner
stayed only 15 minutes.

18:45.814 --> 18:49.727
Well, there is a reason
I came to talk to you.

18:50.071 --> 18:53.063
- Which is?
- It's about Gary.

18:54.245 --> 18:57.317
- About how he...
- Yes?

19:00.464 --> 19:03.740
I'm sorry I bothered you.
I just came to offer my sympathies.

19:04.052 --> 19:05.804
No, wait, um...

19:07.641 --> 19:09.597
Dr Crane...

19:09.854 --> 19:14.803
I listen to you all the time and...
Well, maybe you could help me.

19:18.869 --> 19:21.383
What would you tell
someone who called in

19:21.665 --> 19:24.498
and said they can't get over
why someone died?

19:24.796 --> 19:28.391
I keep running this over and over
in my mind

19:28.718 --> 19:32.791
and I just can't understand
how someone like Gary,

19:33.142 --> 19:37.055
who did everything right,
can just die.

19:37.399 --> 19:40.835
I can't make any sense of it.

19:43.910 --> 19:45.707
Mrs Newman...

19:47.040 --> 19:50.999
I know you'd like me to come up with
an answer to this whole thing,

19:51.339 --> 19:53.295
but I don't have one.

19:53.551 --> 19:58.750
Someone who consumes
cigarettes and burgers can live to be 83

19:59.144 --> 20:03.740
and then someone who takes care
of himself can die at 41.

20:05.362 --> 20:08.752
It's unfair.
Well, there's no explanation for it.

20:09.076 --> 20:11.829
Believe me, I've checked.

20:14.127 --> 20:17.278
But I suppose the best we can do

20:17.591 --> 20:23.143
is live for the little joys and surprises
that life affords us.

20:23.559 --> 20:27.632
You can't spend your life
being obsessed with death.

20:27.983 --> 20:30.816
You're not Jewish, are you?

20:35.036 --> 20:37.675
No, I'm not, but...

20:37.957 --> 20:41.074
Well, thank you
for letting me be here today.

20:41.379 --> 20:43.609
Thank you for coming, Dr Crane.

20:48.683 --> 20:50.594
Oh, Dr Crane!

20:50.854 --> 20:53.209
It was very nice what you said

20:53.483 --> 20:58.113
about living life for the little
joys and surprises it can give us.

20:58.491 --> 21:01.881
- Yes.
- Thank you.

21:02.206 --> 21:06.324
- If only I believed it myself.
- Excuse me.

21:06.672 --> 21:10.221
Um, this is clearly
the most inappropriate thing

21:10.553 --> 21:12.509
I've ever done in my life,

21:12.765 --> 21:14.960
but I was watching you

21:15.227 --> 21:18.981
and I don't know if I'll ever
get the chance to see you again...

21:19.317 --> 21:22.673
and something about you
tells me I'd like to.

21:26.413 --> 21:31.441
If you'd like to get together
sometime, give me a call.

21:43.357 --> 21:45.234
# Baby, I hear the blues a-calling

21:45.485 --> 21:47.953
# Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

21:49.326 --> 21:50.281
# Mercy!

21:50.493 --> 21:52.563
# Maybe I seem I bit confused

21:52.831 --> 21:55.345
# Well, maybe...but I got you pegged!

21:57.631 --> 21:59.508
# But I don't know what to do with those

21:59.759 --> 22:02.478
# Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:03.557 --> 22:04.751
# They're calling again #

22:05.810 --> 22:08.768
Frasier has left the building.

22:09.305 --> 22:15.156
