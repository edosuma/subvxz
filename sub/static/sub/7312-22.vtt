[barking stops]

00:39.952 --> 00:42.259
Like that.All these knives?

00:42.303 --> 00:43.913
Yep. This is what I told
you. Am I right, or what?

00:43.956 --> 00:45.306
You are correct.

00:45.349 --> 00:48.961
100 knives at this price
is an unbelievable deal.

00:49.005 --> 00:51.486
Now, listen, you'd pay more
than twice this amount

00:51.529 --> 00:53.792
if you bought these exact
knives in a store.

00:53.836 --> 00:57.492
This deal can't be beat.

TONY:
Hey, guys!

02:32.630 --> 02:34.589
Tell me you've seen it.

02:34.632 --> 02:36.547
And good morning
to you, too, Tony.

02:36.591 --> 02:38.593
Actually it's the worst morning
in the history of mornings.

02:38.636 --> 02:40.725
My phone!
Tell me you've seen it.

02:40.769 --> 02:43.163
Lost your cell, huh? Ouch.

02:43.206 --> 02:45.643
ZIVA: Well, you are a very
capable investigator.

02:45.687 --> 02:47.123
Why don't you just investigate.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.343
Yes.

02:52.215 --> 02:54.870
[clattering, Tony grunting]

03:01.268 --> 03:03.052
Uh, Tony is just...I don't want to know.

03:03.095 --> 03:05.228
[drawer bangs]
McGee,

03:05.272 --> 03:07.187
did you write this?

03:07.230 --> 03:09.363
I did.
Why, is something wrong?

03:10.929 --> 03:12.540
"Retinal scanner uses

03:12.583 --> 03:14.368
wavefront-sensing
reflection points..."

03:14.411 --> 03:16.196
Yeah.

03:16.239 --> 03:18.850
"...correlates the data using
a point spread function..."

03:18.894 --> 03:22.332
Yeah.
"...rasterizes the pupil
conjugate-geometry."

03:22.376 --> 03:23.855
Was I too technical?

03:23.899 --> 03:25.770
[Tony muttering]

03:29.209 --> 03:31.950
Well, uh...
it's pretty straightforward.

03:31.994 --> 03:34.039
The eyeball from
the Port-to-Port Killer

03:34.083 --> 03:36.041
unlocked MTAC's
retinal scanner.

03:36.085 --> 03:37.956
Yes, I know that, McGee.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.045
Well, Agent Barrett
and her team did find

03:40.089 --> 03:43.135
the eye's retinal pattern
in MTAC's Access Directory,

03:43.179 --> 03:45.660
but the name attached is
marked "classified."
By who?

03:45.703 --> 03:47.227
Uh, don't know.

03:47.270 --> 03:49.490
And they searched every entry
log in the entire system.

03:49.533 --> 03:50.969
[mutters]
It's an extra eyeball.

03:51.013 --> 03:53.842
But it's been put on
the back burner for now.

03:53.885 --> 03:55.060
TONY: Agent Barrett and her team
left for Hawaii last night,

03:55.104 --> 03:56.975
following a new lead.

03:57.019 --> 03:58.281
I can keep checking
other avenues if you want.

03:58.325 --> 03:59.282
I want!

03:59.326 --> 04:01.023
[clattering]

04:01.066 --> 04:02.285
DiNozzo.

04:02.329 --> 04:04.331
What the hell
are you doing?

04:04.374 --> 04:05.810
I lost my phone.
You haven't seen it?

04:08.596 --> 04:11.120
Use mine.

04:11.163 --> 04:13.427
Wow, that's heavy.

04:13.470 --> 04:14.776
I need something
with a computer on it

04:14.819 --> 04:17.257
so I can program ringtones.
Otherwise I don't...

04:17.300 --> 04:18.693
'Cause I have a... It's ringing.[cell phone rings]

04:21.826 --> 04:23.567
Answer it.

04:25.395 --> 04:26.570
Special Agent Gibbs' desk.

04:26.614 --> 04:28.180
This is Very Special Agent
Anthony DiNo...

04:28.224 --> 04:29.399
Oh, hey.

04:29.443 --> 04:31.096
Where? Okay.

04:31.140 --> 04:33.490
Dead guy. Navy Lodge.

04:33.534 --> 04:35.318
Let's go.

04:35.362 --> 04:37.581
Here you go.

04:38.321 --> 04:40.541
That's very nice of you,
but I'm good.

04:43.935 --> 04:45.589
Looks like
the Port-to-Port Killer

04:45.633 --> 04:47.678
is back on the front burner.

04:47.722 --> 04:50.072
GIBBS:
Duck?
DUCKY:
Agent McGee,

04:50.115 --> 04:51.682
if you would be so kind.

04:51.726 --> 04:53.118
Should I call
Agent Barrett?

04:55.512 --> 04:58.080
Nope.
But this is her...

04:58.123 --> 05:00.343
loss for not
being in town.

05:00.387 --> 05:01.910
We don't even know what we're
looking at yet, DiNozzo.

05:01.953 --> 05:04.347
McGEE:
I know what
we're notlooking at.

05:04.391 --> 05:06.567
At his age, there's no way
this guy's a three-star admiral.

05:06.610 --> 05:08.482
DUCKY:
Yeah, well...

05:08.525 --> 05:12.137
the Port-to-Port Killer
is fond of dressing his victims

05:12.181 --> 05:14.096
in higher-ranking uniforms.

05:14.139 --> 05:17.186
Uh, there's the usual lack
of defensive wounds.

05:17.229 --> 05:18.492
Not a drop of blood.

05:18.535 --> 05:22.713
And the expected
enigmatic clue.

05:22.757 --> 05:24.541
In this case...A fortune cookie.

05:24.585 --> 05:25.934
Can't wait to crack that open.

05:25.977 --> 05:28.240
You got a time of death, Duck?Well,

05:28.284 --> 05:30.330
the body's already reached
ambient temperature.

05:30.373 --> 05:32.027
But from his skin color,
well it...

05:32.070 --> 05:34.377
tells me that
not more than 12 hours.

05:34.421 --> 05:36.945
That's right around the time
Agent Barrett left for Hawaii.

05:36.988 --> 05:39.121
It's almost like the killer was
waiting for her to leave town.

05:39.164 --> 05:41.471
And for the grand finale...

05:47.085 --> 05:49.131
...a six-centimeter cut,

05:49.174 --> 05:52.177
ear to ear,
severing the carotid artery.

05:52.221 --> 05:54.397
Our killer is nothing
if not consistent.

05:54.441 --> 05:55.311
Is there anything wrong, Tony?

05:55.355 --> 05:57.835
Yeah. I know him.

05:57.879 --> 05:59.446
McGEE:
Who is he?

06:01.012 --> 06:02.623
He's my old partner.

06:10.848 --> 06:13.590
I imagine you and Anthony
were quite close.

06:13.634 --> 06:17.028
And as partners, your very lives
depended on your

06:17.072 --> 06:18.639
trust in one another.

06:18.682 --> 06:21.468
Yeah, I'd hate to be
in your killer's shoes

06:21.511 --> 06:23.818
when Anthony's
catch up with him.

06:23.861 --> 06:25.167
GIBBS:
What do you got, Duck.

06:25.210 --> 06:27.212
Well, the same
type of blade

06:27.256 --> 06:29.780
as the prior murders
was used on his neck.

06:29.824 --> 06:31.129
Again, the body has been
scrubbed vigorously,

06:31.173 --> 06:33.828
and the characteristic manicure.

06:33.871 --> 06:35.177
GIBBS:
Any differences?

06:35.220 --> 06:38.441
Yeah, this body was sedated
prior to his death.

06:38.485 --> 06:40.574
But the most notable
difference is the

06:40.617 --> 06:43.011
choice of victims.

06:43.054 --> 06:44.621
Anthony knows this one.

06:44.665 --> 06:46.449
As to the significance of that,

06:46.493 --> 06:47.972
perhaps if I knew
more about him...

06:48.016 --> 06:50.540
Uh...

06:50.584 --> 06:52.020
We worked homicide
in Baltimore together.

06:52.063 --> 06:53.587
So you said.

06:53.630 --> 06:55.415
Did he have any Naval
experience?

06:55.458 --> 06:57.242
He was a reservist

06:57.286 --> 06:58.679
before he joined the force.

06:58.722 --> 07:02.030
I suppose it is possible
that Anthony's relation

07:02.073 --> 07:04.989
to him is, uh,
merely coincidental.

07:05.033 --> 07:06.469
You want to bet, Duck?

07:06.513 --> 07:08.253
Nothing I'd care to lose.

07:08.297 --> 07:09.777
Anything else?

07:09.820 --> 07:14.390
Yeah, all of the prior victims
were in perfect health.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.436
But this one suffered
from a severe

07:16.479 --> 07:18.568
alcohol-induced cirrhosis.

07:18.612 --> 07:21.571
He must've had...
quite a drinking problem.

07:23.355 --> 07:26.054
Not when I knew him, but, uh...

07:26.097 --> 07:27.795
a few years
after I left for NCIS,

07:27.838 --> 07:29.623
I know that...

07:29.666 --> 07:31.842
he was asked to retire.

07:31.886 --> 07:33.714
I see.
Yeah, um...

07:33.757 --> 07:36.499
Came from money, not that
he ever saw much of it.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.849
His dad... wasn't around much

07:38.893 --> 07:40.242
and his mom died
when he was a kid.

07:40.285 --> 07:42.374
So you and he had
quite a lot in common.

07:42.418 --> 07:45.508
I'm surprised I never heard
you mention him.

07:45.552 --> 07:46.988
Well, you know how it is.

07:49.164 --> 07:51.383
You lose touch,
time goes by.

07:51.427 --> 07:53.908
Too much time, in this case.

07:53.951 --> 07:57.041
And when it's gone,
you can never get it back.

08:03.134 --> 08:06.268
What do you think, huh?TONY: Oh... that looks painful.

08:06.311 --> 08:08.618
It's very
Robert Mitchum, 1955.

08:08.662 --> 08:09.793
Night of the Hunter.

08:09.837 --> 08:11.099
Does it really go
with the suit, though?

08:11.142 --> 08:13.101
Oh, it's-it's Nino Cerruti.

08:13.144 --> 08:14.842
Cerruti.
And forgive me
if I don't

08:14.885 --> 08:16.539
take fashion advice from a man
who still wears tube socks.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.106
What's the matter
with tube socks?

08:18.149 --> 08:19.847
They're very comfortable,
and they give me traction.

08:19.890 --> 08:21.457
For what?
MAN:
Get off of me!

08:21.501 --> 08:23.807
[man grunts]

08:23.851 --> 08:25.461
[grunting]

08:25.505 --> 08:27.855
[yells, cries out]

08:27.898 --> 08:28.986
[officers exclaim]Yeesh. Ow.

08:29.030 --> 08:30.161
OFFICER:
All right, get up!

08:30.205 --> 08:32.033
Come on, let's go.Let go. Ah!

08:32.076 --> 08:33.948
Move it!

08:33.991 --> 08:36.080
You didn't need
tube socks for that.

08:36.124 --> 08:38.387
A little help.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.563
Thanks.

08:40.607 --> 08:42.609
Everybody, I just want you to
know I'm a little disappointed.

08:42.652 --> 08:45.089
PCP addicts are Friday night.
It's Saturday night,

08:45.133 --> 08:46.700
which is hooker night.
Where are the hookers?

08:46.743 --> 08:48.179
WOMAN: Hey, Tony.[wolf whistle]
Ho!

08:49.616 --> 08:51.226
I mean, the call girls.
Hi, Sapphire.

08:51.269 --> 08:53.576
When's the big day?Uh, it's...

08:53.620 --> 08:54.838
Thanks for those
Christmas decorations.

08:54.882 --> 08:56.231
No problem, baby.
[giggles]

08:56.274 --> 08:57.580
All right, all right.

08:57.624 --> 08:59.408
Now if you kiddies
have had your fun,

08:59.451 --> 09:00.452
we got some business.

09:00.496 --> 09:01.976
First up,
we finished the tally

09:02.019 --> 09:03.978
and we got this year's winner

09:04.021 --> 09:05.632
of the Station House
Pool Championship.

09:05.675 --> 09:07.111
Let me guess.

09:07.155 --> 09:08.765
That would be me?

09:08.809 --> 09:10.550
As a matter of fact
it is, Anthony.

09:10.593 --> 09:11.594
Thank you very much.

09:11.638 --> 09:13.204
[mild whistling]

09:13.248 --> 09:14.815
TONY:
Thank you. Thank you, Major.

09:14.858 --> 09:16.947
It is my second year in a row,
and-and it's, uh, a great honor.

09:16.991 --> 09:18.383
You're my Lombardi.

09:18.427 --> 09:20.037
I thank you.
Enjoy.

09:20.081 --> 09:21.778
Wow. A stapler.

09:21.822 --> 09:23.214
What-what is that?

09:23.258 --> 09:25.260
Mighty Mouse.

09:25.303 --> 09:26.827
Mighty Mouse?Found it at a
garage sale.

09:26.870 --> 09:28.742
[laughs]All I can afford on my salary.

09:28.785 --> 09:30.657
Very sweet of you, sir.Yeah, don't mention it.

09:30.700 --> 09:31.962
Second order
of business:

09:32.006 --> 09:34.269
who's got the, uh,
the Franklin homicide?

09:34.312 --> 09:36.619
TONY:
Oh, yeah, that's us. I mean...Yeah.

09:36.663 --> 09:38.969
Good. Knock yourselves out.Thank you, Major.

09:39.013 --> 09:40.492
What do we got?

09:40.536 --> 09:43.844
Ah. A hit on the prints we
found at the murder scene.

09:43.887 --> 09:47.282
Joseph Manheim aka Joey Peanuts.

09:47.325 --> 09:48.675
Nice name.

09:48.718 --> 09:50.415
You ever heard of him?
Nope.

09:50.459 --> 09:53.418
I guess we should go
check him out.

09:53.462 --> 09:56.291
The Port-to-Port Killer didn't
leave us much to go on, Gibbs.

09:56.334 --> 09:58.902
He used the same antiseptic
to clean the body,

09:58.946 --> 10:00.295
which we could never
trace back to him.

10:00.338 --> 10:02.297
He used the same
industrial plastic

10:02.340 --> 10:04.516
to wrap the
body, which...It was a dead end, too.

10:04.560 --> 10:05.822
Thanks for reminding me.

10:05.866 --> 10:08.651
I mean, everything
is the same.

10:08.695 --> 10:11.306
Right down to the knot he used
to tie his victims' feet.

10:11.349 --> 10:13.264
If this guy keeps walking
in his own footsteps,

10:13.308 --> 10:15.266
we're never gonna catch him.He won't.

10:15.310 --> 10:17.225
He'll make a mistake.
They all do.

10:17.268 --> 10:19.314
Actually, I'm just wallowing
in my own self-pity.

10:19.357 --> 10:21.664
He or she may have already
made a mistake.

10:21.708 --> 10:23.927
I opened the fortune cookie,
and, shockingly,

10:23.971 --> 10:25.233
there was a fortune inside.

10:25.276 --> 10:26.669
You don't have to
strain, Gibbs.

10:26.713 --> 10:29.150
I made you your very
own Gibbs version.

10:30.978 --> 10:33.894
"Keep your friends close
but your enemies closer."

10:33.937 --> 10:37.375
So, the company that made
this particular cookie

10:37.419 --> 10:39.639
embeds its initials
in the side of the dough.

10:39.682 --> 10:42.859
The "DH" is probably embossed
on a cookie sheet.
Who?

10:42.903 --> 10:45.383
Um, the logo belongs to

10:45.427 --> 10:48.125
Dao Huang Fortune Cookie
Company, in Baltimore.

10:48.169 --> 10:50.606
If the quote isn't
random, Gibbs...
It wasn't.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.260
...then it had to be put

10:52.303 --> 10:54.131
inside the cookie
before it was folded.

10:54.175 --> 10:55.611
Otherwise, I would
be able to tell.

10:55.655 --> 10:56.830
Which means it was put there

10:56.873 --> 10:58.135
by someone who had
access to the kitchen.

10:58.179 --> 10:59.049
That's nice work, Abbs.

10:59.093 --> 11:01.182
Xie xie,Gibbs.

11:01.225 --> 11:04.272
But if the quote isn't random,
then what does that mean?

11:04.315 --> 11:06.056
Nothing good.

11:06.100 --> 11:08.711
What if the killer's trying to
tell us he's gonna come after

11:08.755 --> 11:09.799
our friends?

11:09.843 --> 11:11.192
I mean, Tony
knew the victim.

11:11.235 --> 11:12.410
Not just Tony.

11:12.454 --> 11:13.934
I knew him, too.

11:13.977 --> 11:15.979
MAN [over radio]:
Welcome back, Baltimore,

11:16.023 --> 11:17.807
to the Johnny
and Rex show.

11:17.851 --> 11:21.115
MAN 2:
So let's continue our
discussion on Cal Ripken, Jr.,

11:21.158 --> 11:22.986
baseball's
new retired Ironman.

11:23.030 --> 11:24.422
Let's do it.All right, so, Rex,

11:24.466 --> 11:26.207
does Cal get into
the Hall of Fame

11:26.250 --> 11:28.426
on his streak
or on his stats?

11:28.470 --> 11:30.080
Are you serious?
Is that a real question?

11:30.124 --> 11:31.255
Streak or no streak,
Cal Ripken, Jr. goes into...

11:33.083 --> 11:34.215
Whoo!What's the deal?

11:34.258 --> 11:35.651
It's been three hours.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.566
[panting]

11:37.609 --> 11:38.915
He says Joey Peanuts will show.

11:38.959 --> 11:39.916
He's got some kind of meet.

11:42.310 --> 11:44.442
You ate all my moo shu.

11:44.486 --> 11:46.183
I didn't see your name on it.

11:47.576 --> 11:49.012
Oh. Hey, look.

11:49.056 --> 11:50.274
I think this is for you.

11:52.581 --> 11:53.800
[laughs]

11:53.843 --> 11:55.802
"Love is for the lucky
and the brave."

11:55.845 --> 11:57.238
Why is that for me?

11:57.281 --> 11:59.501
Hey, man, asking your high
school music teacher out

11:59.544 --> 12:01.111
qualifies as
brave in my book.

12:01.155 --> 12:03.853
Wendy asked me out, remember?

12:03.897 --> 12:06.247
See, that's why you
can dress like that.

12:06.290 --> 12:07.639
'Cause you're
good-looking.

12:07.683 --> 12:11.252
But one of these days, the
looks are gonna run out.

12:11.295 --> 12:13.820
I plan to be safely married
by then, Danny.

12:13.863 --> 12:16.779
Well, if not, you might want
to consider a new wardrobe.

12:16.823 --> 12:18.738
Seriously.

12:18.781 --> 12:21.088
Yeah, with the right clothes,
you'd be unstoppable.

12:21.131 --> 12:22.393
What's that supposed to mean?

12:22.437 --> 12:25.309
[radio continues playing
indistinctly]

12:25.353 --> 12:26.702
There's our boy.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.965
Joey Peanuts.

12:29.009 --> 12:31.054
You dress like my father.

12:31.098 --> 12:32.229
Let's go.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.810
Crap. I got him!

12:47.854 --> 12:49.290
Stop! Baltimore PD!

12:49.333 --> 12:50.987
Freeze, dirtbag!

12:51.031 --> 12:54.077
You can't outrun me;
I'm wearing tube socks!

12:56.036 --> 12:57.689
[grunting]

13:02.956 --> 13:04.087
I said freeze, dirtbag!

13:12.748 --> 13:14.402
McGEE:
Look, I'm just
saying that I think

13:14.445 --> 13:16.056
Tony is more upset
than he's letting on.

13:16.099 --> 13:18.101
Yes, but he and his partner
had not spoken in years.

13:18.145 --> 13:20.277
Okay, let's say you and
I hadn't spoken in years,

13:20.321 --> 13:22.192
and I get my throat slit
by a serial killer.

13:22.236 --> 13:23.541
I would hunt him down

13:23.585 --> 13:25.892
and make him regret
the day he was born.

13:25.935 --> 13:27.589
You're not just
any partner, McGee.

13:27.632 --> 13:28.590
Neither is Tony.

13:29.765 --> 13:31.114
Dao Huang.

13:31.158 --> 13:33.160
All right.

13:40.080 --> 13:42.125
[Russian accent]:
Can I help you?

13:42.169 --> 13:45.607
Yes. I'm Agent McGee
from NCIS.

13:45.650 --> 13:46.869
And this is my partner

13:46.913 --> 13:48.218
Agent David.

13:48.262 --> 13:49.654
We're looking
for Dao Huang.

13:49.698 --> 13:51.004
Well, you found him.

13:52.570 --> 13:54.224
Your name is Dao Huang?

13:55.660 --> 13:58.185
Try looking at a map
sometimes, okay?

13:58.228 --> 14:00.100
China is right next to Russia.

14:00.143 --> 14:02.624
My parents emigrated
from Beijing.

14:02.667 --> 14:05.583
I was adopted in Kiev,
we moved to D.C.

14:05.627 --> 14:07.281
Bing!
Okay.

14:07.324 --> 14:10.023
Is it any stranger than an
American with an Irish name?

14:10.066 --> 14:11.589
Have you ever been to Ireland?

14:11.633 --> 14:12.982
I-I have not.

14:13.026 --> 14:15.289
That's a very good point.
I'm sorry.

14:15.332 --> 14:17.291
Listen, we just need to ask you
a few questions.

14:17.334 --> 14:19.293
Uh, can you identify these?

14:22.992 --> 14:24.907
Looks like one of mine.

14:24.951 --> 14:27.518
Has my logo.

14:27.562 --> 14:28.519
You see?

14:28.563 --> 14:29.651
I bake it in.

14:32.045 --> 14:33.960
But the coloring
is wrong.

14:34.003 --> 14:36.440
And that is not
one of my sayings.

14:36.484 --> 14:38.268
That cookie is a forgery.

14:38.312 --> 14:39.704
Do you have any employees
that might've made it?

14:39.748 --> 14:41.010
No.

14:41.054 --> 14:42.664
I do all the
printing myself.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.538
Where'd you get this cookie?

14:47.582 --> 14:49.062
We found it
at a crime scene.

14:49.105 --> 14:51.064
Hmm. Could've
been made

14:51.107 --> 14:53.066
from one of the trays
taken in the robbery.

14:53.109 --> 14:54.937
Robbery?

14:54.981 --> 14:56.460
Yeah, five
weeks ago.

14:56.504 --> 15:00.116
Someone broke in and took
my safe and some equipment.

15:00.160 --> 15:02.336
This business can be
quite cutthroat.

15:02.379 --> 15:03.772
Most people don't know that.

15:03.815 --> 15:05.469
Do the police have any suspects?

15:05.513 --> 15:07.558
They took a report,

15:07.602 --> 15:10.997
some evidence, and they ate
a half a case of cookies.

15:11.040 --> 15:14.478
I'm not
expecting much.

15:14.522 --> 15:16.524
Well, maybe we can take
a second look for you.

15:17.742 --> 15:19.962
TONY:
Thanks.

15:20.006 --> 15:23.052
Well, it's confirmed,
he's a cop.

15:23.096 --> 15:24.836
A Navy cop.

15:24.880 --> 15:28.275
Special Agent
Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

15:28.318 --> 15:29.754
DANNY:
Oops.

15:29.798 --> 15:31.452
We're sorry.

15:31.495 --> 15:33.367
Maybe next time, you'll remember
your identification.

15:33.410 --> 15:37.153
You don't do a lot of
undercover work, do you?

15:37.197 --> 15:38.938
Do you?
You just got arrested.

15:38.981 --> 15:40.548
I let you arrest me.

15:40.591 --> 15:41.984
Let?

15:42.028 --> 15:43.377
[laughs]
Who you kidding?

15:43.420 --> 15:45.596
I chased you half a
block, and I had you

15:45.640 --> 15:46.771
like a gazelle
on the Serengeti.

15:46.815 --> 15:47.772
Am I wrong?

15:47.816 --> 15:49.209
No.
No.

15:49.252 --> 15:50.775
So what am I supposed
to call you,

15:50.819 --> 15:51.907
Special Agent, uh,

15:51.951 --> 15:53.691
Leroy?

15:55.476 --> 15:56.390
Mm-mm?

15:56.433 --> 15:58.000
Jethro?

15:58.044 --> 15:59.959
Jethro? Mm.

16:00.002 --> 16:01.090
TONY:
That's a little
Beverly Hillbillies.

16:01.134 --> 16:03.571
Gibbs it is,
I guess.

16:03.614 --> 16:05.094
All right.

16:05.138 --> 16:06.487
We're working
a homicide.

16:06.530 --> 16:08.880
Joey Peanuts left his
prints at the scene.

16:08.924 --> 16:10.404
We think
he's our guy.

16:10.447 --> 16:12.797
What's your beef with him?

16:12.841 --> 16:15.235
Got a tip someone was using
a Navy payroll office

16:15.278 --> 16:16.410
to launder money.

16:16.453 --> 16:18.412
Haven't I.D.'d him yet, but...

16:18.455 --> 16:19.804
You think Joey
works for him.

16:19.848 --> 16:20.849
That's right.

16:20.892 --> 16:22.024
As what, some
kind of courier?

16:22.068 --> 16:23.634
That's right.

16:23.678 --> 16:24.984
So you put on
a funny hat,

16:25.027 --> 16:26.811
fill a briefcase
with some cash,

16:26.855 --> 16:29.597
give Joey the dirty dough,
he gives it to his boss,

16:29.640 --> 16:31.425
you follow the trail
and make the bust?

16:31.468 --> 16:33.383
That was the plan.

16:34.819 --> 16:36.125
Until you screwed it up.

16:36.169 --> 16:37.866
[chuckles]
Me?

16:37.909 --> 16:39.781
Listen here.

16:39.824 --> 16:42.088
You're the one that didn't
tell the department

16:42.131 --> 16:45.569
that your, uh,
NCIS was running an op.

16:45.613 --> 16:46.788
Or read our dispatch.

16:46.831 --> 16:48.659
We had a BOLO out on Joey
for two days.

16:48.703 --> 16:50.270
Yeah, I know.

16:50.313 --> 16:53.142
You knew?

16:53.186 --> 16:54.578
Well, then what the
hell were you doing,

16:54.622 --> 16:56.189
running around,
risking...

16:57.581 --> 16:58.800
[laughs]

17:00.019 --> 17:01.846
Really?

17:03.196 --> 17:05.807
You wanted to
get arrested.

17:05.850 --> 17:07.461
We didn't screw
anything up for him.

17:07.504 --> 17:09.158
You're a new face
on the street.

17:09.202 --> 17:12.683
What's the best way to earn
instant bona fides then, uh,

17:12.727 --> 17:14.990
getting pinched?

17:15.034 --> 17:18.254
[chuckles]:
Navy Guy.

17:18.298 --> 17:20.387
I don't like
getting played.

17:20.430 --> 17:23.390
Having said that,
well played.

17:23.433 --> 17:24.565
Very Donnie Brasco,
actually.

17:24.608 --> 17:26.175
Yeah, but w-we're done
with games.

17:26.219 --> 17:28.047
Joey's our witness;
we're interrogating him.

17:28.090 --> 17:29.178
I know.

17:29.222 --> 17:31.093
I'm undercover, remember?

17:33.791 --> 17:35.924
McGEE:
The break-in at the bakery
was five weeks ago.

17:35.967 --> 17:37.099
The thief kicked in a door.

17:37.143 --> 17:38.144
Took off with the safe.

17:38.187 --> 17:40.059
Other than that, nothing.

17:40.102 --> 17:41.886
No fingerprints,
no footprints.

17:41.930 --> 17:44.454
No physical evidence at all.

17:44.498 --> 17:45.629
TONY:
That's the Port-to-Port
Killer's M.O.

17:45.673 --> 17:47.588
You got witnesses?Sort of.

17:47.631 --> 17:50.417
Police report lists
a cracked-out junkie

17:50.460 --> 17:54.421
says he saw a car
leaving the scene.

17:54.464 --> 17:56.249
Where are my glasses?

17:56.292 --> 17:58.251
Didn't get plates,
just a make and model.

17:58.294 --> 17:59.339
Police didn't
put out a BOLO.

17:59.382 --> 18:00.514
Didn't think it
was credible.

18:00.557 --> 18:02.429
McGee.
BOLO, got it.

18:02.472 --> 18:04.996
Ziva.I will track the junkie, see
if I can get any more info.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.650
DiNozzo.

18:06.694 --> 18:08.174
Yeah?

18:10.350 --> 18:11.525
Talk to me.

18:11.568 --> 18:12.874
About what?

18:12.917 --> 18:14.397
Are you okay?

18:14.441 --> 18:15.311
I'm fine.

18:16.791 --> 18:18.967
This has nothing
to do with that.

18:19.010 --> 18:20.447
Ancient history.

18:20.490 --> 18:23.450
Yeah, I know, but that doesn't
make this any easier.

18:25.887 --> 18:28.846
I'm fine.

18:28.890 --> 18:30.761
I'm more worried
about Abby's theory

18:30.805 --> 18:33.242
that the Port-to-Port Killer
is targeting our friends.

18:33.286 --> 18:34.765
Can't protect
all of them.

18:34.809 --> 18:37.377
We protect them
by catching the killer.

18:39.161 --> 18:41.468
Same as you did before.

18:48.823 --> 18:51.173
Messy, huh?

18:51.217 --> 18:54.263
I don't know
nothing about that.

18:54.307 --> 18:55.525
Didn't say
that you did.

18:55.569 --> 18:57.092
But you do.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.311
I don't even
know the guy.

18:59.660 --> 19:02.358
Well,

19:02.402 --> 19:03.490
it's possible we screwed up.

19:05.056 --> 19:08.016
Are you 100% sure

19:08.059 --> 19:09.539
you've never seen
this guy before?

19:09.583 --> 19:10.758
Yeah, yeah.

19:10.801 --> 19:12.281
100%.

19:12.325 --> 19:14.849
We found your prints
at the crime scene.

19:14.892 --> 19:17.765
Which means if we can't
put you away for murder...

19:17.808 --> 19:20.202
We got you on obstruction
of justice in a capital case.

19:20.246 --> 19:21.551
What's the maximum
on that again?

19:21.595 --> 19:23.379
I think it's,
like, 20 years, Joey.

19:23.423 --> 19:24.641
DANNY:
Isn't it, isn't it 30?

19:24.685 --> 19:25.903
Yeah, I think it's 30.

19:25.947 --> 19:28.384
Actually, yeah, know what,
we'll figure it out.

19:28.428 --> 19:29.472
Thanks for your time, Joey.

19:31.909 --> 19:33.911
[sighs]

19:33.955 --> 19:35.609
Okay, okay.

19:35.652 --> 19:37.219
Okay. Wait.

19:37.263 --> 19:39.308
I get it.
I get it.

19:39.352 --> 19:43.312
Yeah, I was in his car,
but that was over a week ago.

19:45.793 --> 19:47.186
[chuckles]
You.

19:47.229 --> 19:48.883
Here you go,
have a piece of gum.

19:48.926 --> 19:49.927
Ah, come on.

19:49.971 --> 19:51.494
No, no, no, have
a piece. Come on.

19:51.538 --> 19:52.800
Don't make me chew alone.

19:52.843 --> 19:54.062
It'll make you feel better.

19:54.105 --> 19:55.716
Gets the jaw moving.

19:55.759 --> 19:56.717
There you go.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.675
It's wintry fresh.

20:00.808 --> 20:03.114
Now talk.

20:06.901 --> 20:11.253
I, um, I picked up a package
from this guy last week.

20:11.297 --> 20:13.255
That's why you found
my prints, okay?

20:13.299 --> 20:14.082
What was the package?

20:16.519 --> 20:18.086
Chew.

20:18.129 --> 20:19.696
[sighs]

20:19.740 --> 20:21.568
It was a duffel bag.

20:21.611 --> 20:22.917
50 grand inside.

20:24.092 --> 20:25.963
Dirty money.

20:26.007 --> 20:28.009
Huh. And you were gonna
clean it for him?

20:28.052 --> 20:30.272
No! No, no, no.

20:30.316 --> 20:31.273
[sighs]

20:31.317 --> 20:33.275
I'm just a
courier, okay?

20:33.319 --> 20:35.146
I pick up dirty
money from clients

20:35.190 --> 20:37.148
and I bring it to my boss.

20:37.192 --> 20:40.064
He... he does the laundering.

20:40.108 --> 20:42.850
I'm just trying to make a
few extra bucks while I...

20:42.893 --> 20:44.591
I take the real estate exam.

20:44.634 --> 20:46.201
[chuckles]
You know?

20:46.245 --> 20:47.594
We get it.

20:47.637 --> 20:48.725
Joey, come on.

20:48.769 --> 20:50.074
So, tell us,
what went wrong?

20:50.118 --> 20:51.598
I don't know.

20:51.641 --> 20:53.861
I don't know how my
boss finds these guys.

20:53.904 --> 20:55.950
Franklin was
an amateur.

20:55.993 --> 20:58.257
He was pissed
at the size of the vig.

20:58.300 --> 20:59.780
He threatened to
kill my boss

20:59.823 --> 21:01.869
if he didn't
get a refund...

21:01.912 --> 21:03.131
So your boss
killed him first.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.004
Chew.

21:09.180 --> 21:10.878
Maybe.

21:10.921 --> 21:13.054
Maybe, okay?

21:13.097 --> 21:14.229
Either he did it

21:14.273 --> 21:15.752
or he's got muscle.

21:15.796 --> 21:18.886
I just know I didn't.

21:18.929 --> 21:21.410
Your boss have a name?

21:21.454 --> 21:24.544
Yeah. I mean,
everyone's got a name.

21:24.587 --> 21:27.242
But I don't know it
or how to reach him.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.852
You had a package to deliver.

21:31.377 --> 21:32.856
Which means you know
where he's gonna be.

21:34.728 --> 21:36.207
Uh-huh.

21:36.251 --> 21:37.600
Yeah, yeah.

21:39.167 --> 21:40.690
Thank you for your cooperation.

21:40.734 --> 21:42.605
We will contact you if we have
any more questions.

21:45.086 --> 21:46.522
[sighs]

21:46.566 --> 21:48.524
That was a waste.

21:48.568 --> 21:50.221
He had nothing to add
to his statement

21:50.265 --> 21:51.832
about the robbery
at the bakery,

21:51.875 --> 21:53.355
and I'm not going back in there

21:53.399 --> 21:54.748
unless it is absolutely
fumigated.

21:54.791 --> 21:56.793
Twice.

21:56.837 --> 21:58.578
Jethro.

21:58.621 --> 21:59.927
Oh, thank goodness
I found you.

21:59.970 --> 22:02.016
Whoa.

22:02.059 --> 22:03.626
What... what is that smell?

22:03.670 --> 22:04.888
Duck.
Huh?

22:04.932 --> 22:06.237
Oh, sorry.

22:06.281 --> 22:09.110
Uh, I just received
an e-mail from Abby

22:09.153 --> 22:11.286
alerting me to an
alarming oversight.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.810
It seems there
was a minor error

22:13.854 --> 22:15.377
in one of my internal
reports five weeks ago.

22:15.421 --> 22:17.074
What kind of error?

22:17.118 --> 22:19.903
Well, as you know, the
Port-to-Port Killer

22:19.947 --> 22:21.905
secures his victim's
feet with rope.

22:21.949 --> 22:24.038
The specific knot is called
a double constrictor.

22:24.081 --> 22:25.692
ZIVA:
Double?

22:25.735 --> 22:27.258
I thought it was
a plain constrictor knot.

22:27.302 --> 22:28.999
Well, that is
the error.

22:29.043 --> 22:31.393
Mr. Palmer managed
to leave out the word "double"

22:31.437 --> 22:33.003
when he transcribed my notes.

22:33.047 --> 22:34.657
I have suitably chastised him,
but I...

22:34.701 --> 22:36.224
It's a typo, Duck.
Fix it.

22:36.267 --> 22:37.617
Jethro.

22:37.660 --> 22:39.706
Jethro!

22:39.749 --> 22:43.579
The knot on our latest
victim's feet

22:43.623 --> 22:45.929
is a single constrictor.

22:45.973 --> 22:47.844
It's almost as if someone
is using my notes,

22:47.888 --> 22:50.978
typo and all, to
duplicate the murders.

22:51.021 --> 22:54.416
I know details can change
for several reasons,

22:54.460 --> 22:55.809
but given
the Port-to-Port Killer's

22:55.852 --> 22:59.116
almost pathological need
for consistency,

22:59.160 --> 23:00.988
I can only think of
one in this case.

23:01.031 --> 23:02.424
It's not the
Port-to-Port Killer.

23:02.468 --> 23:04.905
We have a copycat, Jethro.

23:04.948 --> 23:09.823
And one who has access
to our internal records.

23:19.049 --> 23:21.443
ZIVA:
The copycat killer
is using one of Ducky's reports

23:21.487 --> 23:22.836
to recreate the murders.

23:22.879 --> 23:24.315
McGEE:
They look almost identical,

23:24.359 --> 23:25.839
but this is the wrong knot.

23:25.882 --> 23:27.710
How'd he get access?I'm running

23:27.754 --> 23:29.320
a system-wide check now.
So far nothing.

23:29.364 --> 23:32.411
Unfortunately, this means
that our psych profile

23:32.454 --> 23:33.803
is now worthless.

23:33.847 --> 23:36.023
We have very little to go on.

23:36.066 --> 23:37.503
The real Port-to-Port Killer
knew how to cover his trail.

23:37.546 --> 23:39.156
McGEE:
Maybe this one didn't.

23:39.200 --> 23:41.550
We might be able to trace one
of his purchases back to him.

23:41.594 --> 23:43.509
Rerun it all--
knife, rope,

23:43.552 --> 23:46.294
antiseptic,
all of it.TONY: Got something else.

23:46.337 --> 23:47.556
Found my cell.

23:47.600 --> 23:49.428
Left it over at EJ's.

23:51.995 --> 23:54.041
Lot of missed calls.

23:54.084 --> 23:57.479
Only one message worth
mentioning-- from two days ago.

23:57.523 --> 24:00.264
[voice mail]:
Hey, Tony, it's Danny.

24:00.308 --> 24:01.962
Long time, no speak.

24:03.703 --> 24:06.140
Uh, I've been thinking
about things lately.

24:06.183 --> 24:09.230
Old friends and TV dinners,
things I messed up,

24:09.273 --> 24:13.408
things right in front of my face
I should have seen.

24:13.452 --> 24:16.411
But I'm not the only one
who saw what he wanted to.

24:18.369 --> 24:20.154
We need to talk.

24:20.197 --> 24:22.156
Better late than never, huh?

24:22.199 --> 24:23.636
Know what that was about?

24:23.679 --> 24:26.334
No, but it's definitely
connected to the murder.

24:26.377 --> 24:28.510
Might mean Price
knows his killer.

24:28.554 --> 24:29.859
Which means I might, too.

24:34.385 --> 24:36.866
We need to talk.

24:36.910 --> 24:38.172
Hold on one second.

24:40.130 --> 24:42.132
Testing, one, two, three.

24:42.176 --> 24:44.221
Can you hear me over there
in the Joey Peanuts gallery?

24:44.265 --> 24:46.746
[over radio]:
Yeah, no, I can hear you.
Very funny.

24:46.789 --> 24:49.052
[chuckles]
Now, listen.

24:49.096 --> 24:51.315
I want you to drop off
the bag with your boss,

24:51.359 --> 24:53.013
then get him to
cop to the murder.

24:53.056 --> 24:56.103
And then, Joey Peanuts,
you get to do

24:56.146 --> 24:59.149
five years of community service,
if you're lucky.

24:59.193 --> 25:00.324
Thanks.

25:00.368 --> 25:02.283
No. Thank you, Joey.

25:02.326 --> 25:03.980
All right. [sighs]

25:04.024 --> 25:05.634
What is it?

25:05.678 --> 25:07.549
This fell out of your jacket.

25:09.029 --> 25:10.639
Hmm?

25:10.683 --> 25:13.773
You planning to propose
to Wendy or something?

25:13.816 --> 25:16.079
Actually, I already did.

25:16.123 --> 25:17.603
What?

25:17.646 --> 25:19.126
Yeah.

25:19.169 --> 25:21.563
I got to take it back
and get it resized, though.

25:21.607 --> 25:22.695
Evidently, it's a little small.

25:22.738 --> 25:25.698
Well... so she said...

25:25.741 --> 25:27.569
She said yes, you smart-ass.

25:27.613 --> 25:29.310
And you were going
to tell me this when?

25:30.746 --> 25:32.356
I haven't told anybody.

25:32.400 --> 25:33.749
In case she said no?

25:33.793 --> 25:35.577
No. I just wanted
to tell her first

25:35.621 --> 25:37.144
before I told anyone else.

25:37.187 --> 25:40.539
Okay. Okay.

25:40.582 --> 25:42.105
Well, congrats, man.
Excellent.
Thanks.

25:42.149 --> 25:44.586
[chuckling]

25:44.630 --> 25:47.197
Oh. We got company.

25:53.029 --> 25:54.335
Civilian clothes.

25:54.378 --> 25:56.772
Military haircut...
and shoes.

25:58.295 --> 25:59.601
You count it?

25:59.645 --> 26:01.168
It's all there, man--
50 grand.

26:01.211 --> 26:03.910
How did we end up doing
the Navy cop's job for him?

26:03.953 --> 26:05.172
'Cause he's smarter than us?

26:05.215 --> 26:07.348
Mmm. More devious, maybe.

26:07.391 --> 26:09.524
I don't know about smarter.

26:09.568 --> 26:10.830
I kind of liked him, actually.

26:10.873 --> 26:12.135
Who'd want to be
a Navy cop?

26:12.179 --> 26:14.398
I'd rather have the plague.

26:14.442 --> 26:16.226
ABBY:
It's really sad

26:16.270 --> 26:19.055
how Tony and his old partner
drifted so far apart.

26:19.099 --> 26:20.535
It happens.Does that mean
it could happen

26:20.579 --> 26:22.276
to my Three Musketeers?
'Cause if you say yes, McGee,

26:22.319 --> 26:23.582
I'm going to start
crying right now.

26:23.625 --> 26:24.670
No, whatever it is.

26:24.713 --> 26:26.106
What do you got, Abbs?

26:26.149 --> 26:28.630
Suspects, and a lot of them.

26:28.674 --> 26:30.589
The last actual
Port-to-Port killing,

26:30.632 --> 26:32.329
I was able to track
down the suppliers

26:32.373 --> 26:33.853
of most of the
items he used.

26:33.896 --> 26:35.985
Brand of antiseptic,
surgical blade.

26:36.029 --> 26:38.031
But I couldn't trace it
back to the killer.

26:38.074 --> 26:39.859
He was very careful to
disguise his purchases.

26:39.902 --> 26:42.818
So, to find the copycat,
we are analyzing

26:42.862 --> 26:44.690
publicly available tax receipts,

26:44.733 --> 26:46.213
looking for people
who bought

26:46.256 --> 26:48.302
three or more of the items
that are in

26:48.345 --> 26:50.217
the Port-to-Port
Killer's toolbox.Okay. How many?

26:50.260 --> 26:52.088
26 so far, and we're not
even halfway through.

26:53.655 --> 26:54.787
GIBBS:
That's our guy.

26:54.830 --> 26:56.527
And you know this
because?

26:56.571 --> 26:58.529
He was at the crime scene.

26:58.573 --> 27:01.402
McGEE:
All right, well, let me
run facial recognition

27:01.445 --> 27:03.534
against our
crime scene photos.

27:05.058 --> 27:06.929
There.

27:10.454 --> 27:12.021
Boss, he's a computer tech.

27:12.065 --> 27:13.980
That means he could have
hacked our servers

27:14.023 --> 27:16.852
and gotten Ducky's report.

27:16.896 --> 27:18.985
How on Earth did you...Rule number 35.

27:21.248 --> 27:24.120
Always watch the watchers.Always watch the watchers.

27:24.164 --> 27:26.209
MAN [recording]:
You count it?

27:26.253 --> 27:29.125
JOEY PEANUTS:
It's all there, man-- 50 grand.

27:29.169 --> 27:30.387
That's more than
I make in a year.

27:30.431 --> 27:31.693
JOEY PEANUTS:
I made sure that he knew

27:31.737 --> 27:32.912
what the vig was up front.

27:32.955 --> 27:35.044
You know, man,
I got enough on my hands

27:35.088 --> 27:35.958
worrying about
that Franklin guy.

27:36.002 --> 27:37.220
Nice segue.

27:37.264 --> 27:38.308
Yeah.

27:38.352 --> 27:39.614
MAN:
Well, you can stop worrying.

27:39.658 --> 27:42.008
I took care of things--
permanently.

27:43.792 --> 27:45.098
Well, it'd be nice
to have ballistics

27:45.141 --> 27:46.403
tying this guy
to the murder,

27:46.447 --> 27:47.927
but that sounds like
a confession to me.

27:47.970 --> 27:49.232
Why didn't you
bring him in?

27:49.276 --> 27:51.060
Uh, Agent Gibbs wanted
to I.D. him first.

27:51.104 --> 27:52.888
Didn't want us to tip
our hand in case he

27:52.932 --> 27:54.368
wasn't working alone.
TONY:
It doesn't matter.

27:54.411 --> 27:56.109
We put a tail on him.
We're going to get our own I.D.

27:56.152 --> 27:57.023
before this guy...[cell phone rings]

28:01.549 --> 28:02.637
It's him.
Mmm.

28:02.681 --> 28:03.812
Let me know.

28:05.335 --> 28:06.510
What do you got?

28:06.554 --> 28:08.121
GIBBS:
His name's Lieutenant Ian Floyd.

28:08.164 --> 28:10.123
TONY:
Hold on. Hold on.

28:10.166 --> 28:12.995
GIBBS:
His name's Lieutenant Ian Floyd.

28:13.039 --> 28:16.390
He's a disbursing officer at a
Navy payroll office in Quantico.

28:16.433 --> 28:18.784
Oh. That's a perfect position
to launder money.

28:18.827 --> 28:20.873
DANNY:
He have any help?[cell phone ringing]

28:20.916 --> 28:22.483
TONY:
You need to get that?

28:22.526 --> 28:24.093
No. It's my wife.

28:24.137 --> 28:25.616
And no.

28:25.660 --> 28:27.618
No. Looks like it's just Floyd.

28:27.662 --> 28:29.098
TONY: We should check
to see when ballistics

28:29.142 --> 28:31.100
on the murder weapon's
going to be done.

28:32.841 --> 28:34.060
It's done.

28:34.103 --> 28:35.801
[chuckles]
I don't think so.

28:35.844 --> 28:37.716
Yeah, I had the evidence
transferred here.

28:37.759 --> 28:40.022
Weapon was a Walther P99.

28:40.066 --> 28:42.242
Floyd's got two registered
to him. Pick him up.

28:42.285 --> 28:43.634
Uh, first of all,
that was our evidence.

28:43.678 --> 28:45.332
And second of all,

28:45.375 --> 28:48.727
if we just transferred it
to you, then how did you get...

28:48.770 --> 28:49.858
[cell phone ringing]

28:49.902 --> 28:51.642
Ah. I got to get this one.

28:51.686 --> 28:53.383
Is that your wife again?

28:53.427 --> 28:55.037
Divorce lawyer.

28:55.777 --> 28:58.301
We've been waiting
for ballistics for over a week.

28:58.345 --> 28:59.999
Roscoe, hang on a second.
Pacci.

29:00.042 --> 29:01.740
You got that
other thing for me?
Yeah.

29:01.783 --> 29:04.264
Detective DiNozzo's personnel
file is right here.

29:04.307 --> 29:06.527
Anything else? I was going
to head to the infirmary.

29:06.570 --> 29:08.224
My ulcer's
killing me again.

29:08.268 --> 29:11.010
I'm telling you, this stomach
is going to be the death of me.

29:11.053 --> 29:13.273
Roscoe, go ahead.

29:13.316 --> 29:15.014
TONY:
Let's hope our copycat's home.

29:15.057 --> 29:16.058
NCIS!

29:17.625 --> 29:19.801
TONY:
Hands in the air!
Peter Sears,

29:19.845 --> 29:21.498
you're under arrest.For what? I didn't do anything.

29:21.542 --> 29:23.022
Oh, my God, this is so exciting.

29:23.065 --> 29:24.284
TONY:
You have the right
to remain silent,

29:24.327 --> 29:25.807
or I can shut
you up myself.

29:25.851 --> 29:27.243
GIBBS:
Take it easy, DiNozzo.

29:27.287 --> 29:28.723
TONY: You also have the
right to an attorney so he

29:28.767 --> 29:30.681
can tell you how you weren't
hugged enough as a child.

29:30.725 --> 29:32.901
Boss?
We got a problem.

29:52.486 --> 29:54.227
Can we have
a time-out here?

29:54.270 --> 29:56.446
I get how bad this looks.

29:56.490 --> 29:57.883
Xeonphine
antiseptic.

29:59.536 --> 30:01.582
Surgical blades.

30:01.625 --> 30:03.671
That's you.

30:03.714 --> 30:06.413
At the victim's crime scene.

30:06.456 --> 30:08.371
TONY:
Rare orchid seeds.

30:08.415 --> 30:10.983
Practice knots.

30:11.026 --> 30:13.681
Well, you put together
a real cute little

30:13.724 --> 30:14.900
Port-to-Port Killer magic kit,

30:14.943 --> 30:16.553
and then you killed
my partner with it.

30:16.597 --> 30:17.816
I told you,
I didn't kill anybody!

30:21.471 --> 30:22.864
This is intense.

30:22.908 --> 30:24.648
I think he's confused,
DiNozzo.

30:24.692 --> 30:26.128
Me, too.

30:26.172 --> 30:28.000
See, we don't need
a confession.

30:28.043 --> 30:30.959
We just need to know
how you hacked our servers,

30:31.003 --> 30:33.701
because this knot isn't
mentioned in the press,

30:33.744 --> 30:35.921
which means you only could have
learned about it from us.

30:37.923 --> 30:39.838
I'm the worst loser
on the entire planet.

30:41.665 --> 30:44.277
I haven't even started yet,
and I got arrested.

30:44.320 --> 30:46.192
[laughing]

30:52.415 --> 30:55.244
I bought all those things.

30:55.288 --> 30:56.680
I tied those knots.

30:56.724 --> 30:58.769
Practice makes
perfect, right?

30:58.813 --> 31:00.902
That's what Uncle Tickle Fingers
always said.

31:00.946 --> 31:02.034
Practice makes perfect.

31:03.862 --> 31:05.864
But that's all I've done
was practice.

31:05.907 --> 31:07.126
Maybe I was going
to do something.

31:07.169 --> 31:08.910
Maybe I was going to get
my name on TV, too,

31:08.954 --> 31:09.998
but you know what?
I haven't done it yet.

31:13.088 --> 31:15.699
You got the wrong guy, bucko.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.842
Sears' alibi checks out.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.931
He's an I.T. consultant,

31:29.975 --> 31:32.281
but he works part-time
as a birthday clown.

31:32.325 --> 31:33.543
He was twisting
balloon animals

31:33.587 --> 31:35.241
for 20 kids
when Price was killed.

31:35.284 --> 31:36.982
Well, that is
disturbing.

31:37.025 --> 31:38.897
Yeah.
He's a copycat killer, boss...

31:38.940 --> 31:40.420
He just hasn't killed yet.

31:40.463 --> 31:42.291
Where's the Pre-crime Unit
when you need it?

31:42.335 --> 31:43.945
Remember that
in Minority Report?

31:43.989 --> 31:46.121
Colin Farrell
and Tom Cruise...I'd rather have a lead.

31:46.165 --> 31:47.818
ZIVA:
Uh, there's still the
robbery at the bakery.

31:47.862 --> 31:49.124
And I think I've got
something on that.

31:49.168 --> 31:51.648
Ohio State Police
just arrested

31:51.692 --> 31:53.433
two men for
grand larceny.

31:53.476 --> 31:54.913
One wants to plea-bargain.

31:54.956 --> 31:56.523
Says he has info on a robbery

31:56.566 --> 31:58.742
at the Fortune Cookie Company
bakery in Baltimore.

31:58.786 --> 32:00.831
Call the prosecutor.I'm going to call
the prosecutor.

32:00.875 --> 32:02.921
Went through Sears'
laptop, as well.

32:02.964 --> 32:04.792
I know how he learned about
the constrictor knot,

32:04.835 --> 32:06.359
and it's not from
an NCIS file.

32:06.402 --> 32:08.970
Where?
Right before Barrett
left for Hawaii,

32:09.014 --> 32:11.103
she issued an update
on the Port-to-Port Killer

32:11.146 --> 32:13.757
to all law enforcement
agencies in the area.

32:13.801 --> 32:14.671
It included Palmer's typo.

32:14.715 --> 32:16.064
Sears stole a copy

32:16.108 --> 32:17.892
of the report
while he was doing

32:17.936 --> 32:19.328
I.T. work in a
police station.

32:19.372 --> 32:21.026
ZIVA:
Which means that our copycat

32:21.069 --> 32:23.289
is someone who had
access to that report.

32:27.336 --> 32:29.382
I have a degree
in physical education!

32:29.425 --> 32:32.254
I played varsity basketball
at Ohio State!

32:32.298 --> 32:34.126
This isn't gonna end
well for you!

32:34.169 --> 32:35.997
Your money laundering days...

32:36.041 --> 32:37.390
[Tony grunts, horn blaring]

32:37.433 --> 32:39.174
[horns honking]

32:39.218 --> 32:40.741
...are over!

32:45.224 --> 32:47.835
Stop!

32:47.878 --> 32:49.489
Or this isn't gonna
end well for you.

32:49.532 --> 32:51.273
Hey, is that a Walther P99?

32:51.317 --> 32:52.796
Thanks.
Now we don't have

32:52.840 --> 32:54.146
to find
the murder weapon.

32:54.189 --> 32:55.930
I walk out of here or I shoot.

32:55.974 --> 32:58.063
You're not walking out of here.

32:58.106 --> 32:59.325
[gunshot]I'm serious!

32:59.368 --> 33:00.630
DANNY:
So are we.

33:05.331 --> 33:07.072
So that's how it's gonna be.

33:08.725 --> 33:10.901
Nice timing.

33:10.945 --> 33:12.251
Hey, better late than never.

33:15.254 --> 33:16.864
[handcuffs clicking]

33:18.779 --> 33:20.389
[door creaks]

33:26.047 --> 33:27.918
[siren wails in distance]

33:30.486 --> 33:32.358
[vehicle approaching, passing
nearby]

33:43.412 --> 33:45.284
[phone rings]

33:47.634 --> 33:49.201
DiNozzo.

33:49.244 --> 33:50.811
Tony, where did you go?

33:50.854 --> 33:51.725
Following a hunch.

33:51.768 --> 33:53.031
What's up?

33:53.074 --> 33:54.815
Well, Ohio came through.

33:54.858 --> 33:57.513
It's confirmed, we got the guy
that robbed the bakery.

33:57.557 --> 33:59.385
You don't sound too happy
about it.

33:59.428 --> 34:01.082
Speeding ticket puts him
in Dayton

34:01.126 --> 34:02.344
the day that Price was killed.

34:02.388 --> 34:04.085
So he's not our copycat.

34:04.129 --> 34:05.782
If you see Gibbs,
can you tell him?

34:05.826 --> 34:07.045
Yeah, sure.

34:10.483 --> 34:12.354
[voice mail]:
Hey, Tony. It's Danny.

34:12.398 --> 34:14.400
Long time, no speak.

34:14.443 --> 34:17.620
Uh, been thinking
about things lately.

34:17.664 --> 34:19.840
Old friends and TV dinners...

34:22.886 --> 34:24.323
[beeps]

34:31.330 --> 34:32.766
[humming]

34:34.072 --> 34:35.290
Ah.

34:39.251 --> 34:40.513
[sighs]

34:42.254 --> 34:44.473
You born in a barn?

34:44.517 --> 34:46.171
It's freezing out.
Close the door.

34:46.214 --> 34:47.694
D.A. says we got enough

34:47.737 --> 34:49.478
to get a murder conviction
against Lieutenant Floyd.

34:49.522 --> 34:51.306
You came all this way
to tell me that?

34:51.350 --> 34:53.395
Actually, I came all the way
here because of what I saw

34:53.439 --> 34:56.137
in Floyd's eyes
when you got the drop on him.

34:56.181 --> 34:57.921
Something that I spent
the last two days

34:57.965 --> 35:01.621
trying to pretend
I didn't see.

35:01.664 --> 35:02.970
And what's that?

35:03.013 --> 35:05.059
Betrayal.

35:05.103 --> 35:07.279
'Cause he knew you.

35:07.322 --> 35:09.368
And I'm wondering
to myself,

35:09.411 --> 35:10.804
"How can that be?"

35:10.847 --> 35:13.198
It didn't make
any sense.

35:13.241 --> 35:15.156
So I pulled your phone records.

35:15.200 --> 35:17.898
The two of you, a couple
of chatty-patties, huh?

35:17.941 --> 35:19.769
15 calls over the
last two months.

35:19.813 --> 35:22.076
I know there's plenty of ways
to explain that, right?

35:22.120 --> 35:24.296
There's only one reason

35:24.339 --> 35:26.036
you never mentioned it.

35:26.080 --> 35:27.081
What's that?

35:27.125 --> 35:28.169
'Cause you're a dirty cop,
Danny.

35:28.213 --> 35:29.692
Tony, come on.

35:29.736 --> 35:30.954
Careful.

35:30.998 --> 35:32.956
Be very careful.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.002
[breathes deeply]

35:35.045 --> 35:37.222
I'm not feeling the love
right now.

35:44.011 --> 35:46.013
Okay.

35:48.494 --> 35:51.192
I was sending
potential clients...

35:51.236 --> 35:53.890
in Floyd's direction.

35:53.934 --> 35:56.589
If they laundered money
through him,

35:56.632 --> 35:58.417
I got a kickback.

35:58.460 --> 36:01.115
So how much did you get
to keep your mouth shut

36:01.159 --> 36:02.595
on a homicide, Danny?

36:02.638 --> 36:05.989
No, no, Tony, I had no idea
that Floyd was our guy.

36:06.033 --> 36:08.470
I mean, did he seem
like a killer to you?

36:08.514 --> 36:10.298
He didn't seem
like one to me!

36:10.342 --> 36:11.734
You saw what you
wanted to see.

36:17.262 --> 36:19.220
So what are you gonna do?

36:28.229 --> 36:30.013
I lost my appetite.

36:38.065 --> 36:40.285
[lid opens]

36:43.331 --> 36:45.768
So I'm gonna take a walk.

36:45.812 --> 36:48.684
I guess if you're still here
when I get back,

36:48.728 --> 36:50.599
I'll have my answer.

36:56.388 --> 36:58.868
[door opens]

36:58.912 --> 37:00.261
[door closes]

37:05.614 --> 37:08.835
[footfalls approaching]

37:08.878 --> 37:10.619
Heads up!

37:10.663 --> 37:13.143
I'm in a shoot-first,
ask-questions-later
frame of mind.

37:18.584 --> 37:19.585
You followed me?

37:22.414 --> 37:23.980
How long did you know?

37:24.024 --> 37:25.852
Didn't.

37:25.895 --> 37:27.245
Just a hunch, huh?

37:27.288 --> 37:30.291
What are you gonna do?

37:30.335 --> 37:31.727
He's your partner.

37:31.771 --> 37:35.688
Yeah.

37:35.731 --> 37:36.906
[sighs]

37:36.950 --> 37:39.431
What am I gonna do?

37:39.474 --> 37:40.954
DANNY [voice mail]:
...things I messed up,

37:40.997 --> 37:43.739
things right in front of my face
I should have seen.

37:43.783 --> 37:47.830
But I'm not the only one
who saw what he wanted to.

37:47.874 --> 37:49.179
We need to talk.

37:49.223 --> 37:50.964
Better late than never, huh?

37:51.007 --> 37:52.922
[footfalls approaching]Son of a bitch.

37:57.318 --> 37:59.451
Followed me again.

37:59.494 --> 38:01.757
Another hunch?

38:01.801 --> 38:02.976
No,

38:03.019 --> 38:04.020
but I could see
you had one.

38:04.064 --> 38:07.067
Danny was dirty.

38:07.110 --> 38:09.591
I always wondered why the money
launderer didn't rat him out,

38:09.635 --> 38:10.940
try to cut a deal.

38:10.984 --> 38:12.464
I bet Danny wondered
the same thing.

38:12.507 --> 38:14.030
There's only one reason
to be afraid

38:14.074 --> 38:15.989
of sending a dirty cop to jail.

38:16.032 --> 38:18.513
There's another one you can't,

38:18.557 --> 38:22.517
and in our department,
that was a pretty short list.

38:22.561 --> 38:23.953
[sighs]

38:23.997 --> 38:26.826
There was a silent partner
Danny didn't know about,

38:26.869 --> 38:28.610
but he found out
after all these years.

38:30.046 --> 38:32.527
"Better late than never"
is right.

38:34.921 --> 38:37.140
I think he was looking
for redemption.

38:38.533 --> 38:40.709
Well, let's go give it to him.

38:42.145 --> 38:44.626
Oh, ladies and gentlemen,

38:44.670 --> 38:46.106
the legend is back,

38:46.149 --> 38:47.542
Anthony DiNozzo, Jr.

38:47.586 --> 38:48.500
[laughing]:
Hey.

38:48.543 --> 38:51.894
Look at what the cat
dragged in.

38:51.938 --> 38:53.331
Agent Gibbs, right?

38:53.374 --> 38:54.810
Man who took my best
detective from me.

38:58.205 --> 39:00.555
What's this?Your evidence
locker logs.

39:00.599 --> 39:02.775
That's how you got the tray
to make the fortune cookie,

39:02.818 --> 39:04.385
which was a
nice touch,

39:04.429 --> 39:06.779
but of course you made your
bones busting serial killers,

39:06.822 --> 39:08.302
so you knew how to
make it smell real.

39:08.346 --> 39:10.870
Danny was right.

39:10.913 --> 39:12.306
Lieutenant Floyd
wasn't a killer.

39:12.350 --> 39:13.351
It was you.

39:13.394 --> 39:14.787
What are you talking about?

39:14.830 --> 39:17.224
Danny figured it out

39:17.267 --> 39:19.531
and he was going to set
the record straight,

39:19.574 --> 39:20.749
so you killed him.

39:23.448 --> 39:25.363
Major,

39:25.406 --> 39:27.408
you knew that DiNozzo
wasn't going to let it go.

39:27.452 --> 39:29.279
So you threw
it in my face.

39:29.323 --> 39:31.020
Dropped another body on
the Port-to-Port pile.

39:32.457 --> 39:34.023
Did you think I would
just assume it was...

39:35.198 --> 39:37.549
...a serial killer?

39:37.592 --> 39:39.420
Let me ask you
something:

39:39.464 --> 39:41.030
what do you see when
you look in the mirror?

39:44.033 --> 39:45.992
Am I done?
Oh, yeah,

39:46.035 --> 39:47.907
you're done.

40:01.486 --> 40:03.096
[elevator bell dings]

40:07.448 --> 40:09.363
Could you imagine
having to arrest Gibbs?

40:09.407 --> 40:10.625
[scoffs]

40:10.669 --> 40:12.148
I would rather
arrest my father,

40:12.192 --> 40:13.585
and I still might have to
one day,

40:13.628 --> 40:14.760
for that matter.DUCKY:
Jethro,

40:14.803 --> 40:17.110
congratulations
on catching

40:17.153 --> 40:18.633
the copycat killer.Thanks, Duck.

40:18.677 --> 40:21.027
However, we have
another problem.

40:21.070 --> 40:25.118
Remember I told you about that
e-mail from Abby concerning

40:25.161 --> 40:27.033
the typo in my report?

40:27.076 --> 40:28.295
Yeah.
ABBY:
I didn't send

40:28.338 --> 40:29.862
Ducky that e-mail,
Gibbs.

40:29.905 --> 40:31.037
Then who was it from?

40:31.080 --> 40:33.474
Presumably someone
who wanted us to know

40:33.518 --> 40:35.476
we were chasing
a copycat killer.

40:35.520 --> 40:37.609
And there's only one person
that could have been.

40:37.652 --> 40:39.175
The real one.

40:39.219 --> 40:40.699
Show me.

40:50.970 --> 40:52.798
[elevator bell dings]

40:58.456 --> 41:00.414
GIBBS:
I got it.

41:00.458 --> 41:02.503
You made it.

41:02.547 --> 41:04.026
Yeah.

41:04.070 --> 41:06.115
Wow, I'm not a big fan
of the orange,

41:06.159 --> 41:08.596
and the glare off that
skylight's ridiculous.

41:15.255 --> 41:17.213
TONY:
You gonna ask?

41:17.257 --> 41:19.041
Nope.

41:19.085 --> 41:21.870
I'm leaving it alone.

41:21.914 --> 41:23.393
It was wrong,
way wrong, but...

41:23.437 --> 41:24.612
It's your partner.

41:24.656 --> 41:26.266
Ex-partner.

41:26.309 --> 41:29.225
I'm not going back to
Baltimore, I can't.

41:29.269 --> 41:30.531
I don't know what
I'm gonna do.

41:30.575 --> 41:32.533
Maybe being a cop
isn't for me.

41:33.665 --> 41:35.536
[chuckles]

41:37.625 --> 41:39.584
Did you just
physically assault me?

41:39.627 --> 41:42.456
I don't have a lot of rules,

41:42.500 --> 41:45.503
but rule number five
is "you don't waste good,"

41:45.546 --> 41:47.505
and you're good.

41:47.548 --> 41:49.202
Thanks.

41:51.509 --> 41:53.380
Don't make a habit of that.

42:00.300 --> 42:01.693
[Tony chuckles]

42:03.782 --> 42:06.306
Did I mention
you're a devious man, Gibbs?

42:06.349 --> 42:08.003
Boy, I got vision,

42:08.047 --> 42:10.745
and the rest of the world
is wearing bifocals.

42:10.789 --> 42:12.007
Butch Cassidy.

42:12.051 --> 42:13.618
Nice!

42:13.661 --> 42:15.315
[chuckles]
