But I can tell you this.

14:04.877 --> 14:08.278
The coroner's report
fixed the time of her death at 1 0:30,

14:08.347 --> 14:12.010
because she was wearing
a wristwatch that got smashed
and that was the time on the watch.

14:12.084 --> 14:16.282
She must've gone back to rescue
somethin' from the storm, right?
Well, then you better tell her to forget it.

14:16.355 --> 14:19.222
If it was that important,
she's not gonna forget about it.

14:19.291 --> 14:22.283
No, I-I gotta get her to go back
and do it earlier.

14:22.361 --> 14:27.128
Oh, my. If we get up
any earlier to do it,

14:27.199 --> 14:29.258
we might as well
not go to sleep.

and-and doin' all kinds of work,

14:42.081 --> 14:47.018

that you need, we should-
we should go back and get it now.

So you better stick with her

I can find out some way to figure out
what it is she went back for.

Bye.
Bye, y'all!

41:59.016 --> 42:00.950
Everybody's leaving except me.

42:01.018 --> 42:02.952
I don't know.
I don't understand it.

42:03.020 --> 42:05.386
You saved Cissy. You saved
the people at the hurricane party.

42:05.456 --> 42:07.583
You should have been out of here
a couple of hours ago.

42:07.658 --> 42:10.684
[ Sighs ]
What do you think's
gonna happen to Lisa?

42:11.729 --> 42:14.527
Lisa? Well, um-
Oh.

42:14.598 --> 42:17.089
I don't know. I think, um-
[ Beeping ]

42:17.167 --> 42:20.398
Well, I think with the right help,
she's probably gonna be-

42:22.139 --> 42:24.835
She'll probably be okay.
[ Beeping, Whining ]

42:24.909 --> 42:27.173
Don't look at me.

42:27.244 --> 42:29.678
Hmm.
That's on the nose, Sam. Yes.

42:29.747 --> 42:34.980
After a couple of years
of intensive therapy,
she turns out to be pretty much okay.

42:36.520 --> 42:41.184
Look, I'm not saying
that you would help <i>her.</i>

42:41.258 --> 42:46.195
I'm just saying that with the right training,
maybe you could help
a lot of people like her.

42:46.263 --> 42:49.596
[ Sighs ]
I mean, look. You're caring.
You're perceptive. You're smart.

42:49.667 --> 42:53.159
You've got every good trait
to be a psychologist.

42:53.237 --> 42:56.934
Oh, but then I'd have to
go back to school.
So what?

42:57.007 --> 43:00.465
I don't think I could face that.
It's kind of scary.

43:00.544 --> 43:03.479
[ Chuckles ]
What have you got to be scared of?

43:03.547 --> 43:07.847
You just lived through a hurricane
and you were almost killed in the middle of it.

43:07.918 --> 43:10.887
I had some help.
Well, yes, you did. That's true.

43:12.256 --> 43:14.190
But-
But what?

43:14.258 --> 43:18.285
Maybe if I had some more help,
I could get through school too.
Well.

43:18.362 --> 43:21.991
<i>That's what the sheriff department's</i>
<i>here for, ma'am.</i>

43:22.066 --> 43:25.524
[ Laughs ]
Thank goodness
I've got their number.

43:25.603 --> 43:27.537
[ Chuckles ]
<i>Ah, bingo.</i>

43:27.605 --> 43:33.510
Yep, she goes back to school, Sam,
and she becomes a psychotherapist.

43:33.577 --> 43:35.943
I'm just so glad we're together.

43:37.514 --> 43:39.448
Yeah.

43:41.952 --> 43:43.886
Me too.

43:54.498 --> 43:57.160
<i>[ Fire Crackling ]</i>

43:57.234 --> 43:59.964
<i>[ Man ]</i>
<i>And we shall dedicate our lives...</i>

44:00.037 --> 44:02.130
<i>to the preservation...</i>

44:02.206 --> 44:06.575
<i>of the purity of the white race.</i>

44:06.644 --> 44:11.604
<i>We fight to the death</i>
<i>to resurrect our country...</i>

44:11.682 --> 44:16.915
<i>from the fires of racial degradation.</i>

44:19.189 --> 44:22.750
And now,
by the powers vested in me...

44:22.826 --> 44:27.160
as a Royal Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan,

44:27.231 --> 44:31.258
I dub thee, fellow Klansman.

44:42.312 --> 44:44.246
Oh, boy.
